02:00.745 --> 02:04.957
Why is it that guys get so macho
when it comes to their cars?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.877
I think it's an extension
of their you-know-whats.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.881
Party hotline. Cancel everything.
We are having a blow-out tonight.

02:11.964 --> 02:13.340
We are?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.926
My parents left for Cabo San Lucas
this morning.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.137
- Who's coming?
- Oh, I don't know.

02:18.220 --> 02:21.474
We'll keep it small, private,
strictly A-list.

02:21.807 --> 02:26.187
- Can I ask Dylan?
- Hot and heavy.

02:26.270 --> 02:29.106
Just make sure you change the sheets
in the guesthouse, Donna.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.941
Goodbye.

02:31.108 --> 02:34.612
Brenda, bring him, there's always room
for one more cute guy.

02:38.824 --> 02:43.037
- Did you hear her say "cute guy"?
- She wasn't talking about you.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.165
You know, sometimes
your negativity is overwhelming.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.463
- Remember me?
- Vaguely.

02:52.546 --> 02:54.256
Donna's having a party tonight.
You wanna go?

02:54.339 --> 02:57.384
I just made plans to surf
Baja this weekend.

02:57.509 --> 02:59.595
You'd rather go surfing
than be with me?

02:59.678 --> 03:01.430
You wanna come along?

03:01.930 --> 03:05.934
- You hate parties, huh?
- I'm better one-on-one.

03:07.311 --> 03:09.813
Any "one" in particular?

03:10.355 --> 03:14.693
- I'll tell you next weekend for sure.
- It's a date.

03:22.451 --> 03:25.203
Brandon, I don't want to go
to this party by myself.

03:25.287 --> 03:28.832
- I said I'd drive you there.
- No, you have to come in with me.

03:28.915 --> 03:32.836
Look, just stay 10 minutes.
If you completely hate it, you can leave.

03:33.462 --> 03:35.464
What if I only mildly hate it?

03:36.256 --> 03:39.885
- Then you have to stay for an hour.
- Brenda.

03:41.344 --> 03:43.138
Look, this morning
weren't you complaining

03:43.221 --> 03:45.390
about being bored and in a total rut?

03:45.473 --> 03:48.226
Everyone's so Beverly Hills.

03:48.518 --> 03:50.228
Brandon, we're Beverly Hills.

03:50.312 --> 03:51.396
Please.

03:52.022 --> 03:53.898
- Pretty please. Triple please.
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.734
Save it for your party tonight.

03:55.817 --> 03:58.570
See, that's why
I need you there to protect me.

04:00.905 --> 04:02.323
I'll think about it.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.910
All day, all I could think about
was that hotel in Palm Springs.

04:05.994 --> 04:08.288
Oh, the company's
really splurging this year.

04:08.371 --> 04:09.789
There's something about
being at a place

04:09.873 --> 04:13.460
where someone you never see puts
a little chocolate mint on your pillow

04:13.543 --> 04:15.962
and a "Do Not Disturb" sign
on the door that...

04:16.045 --> 04:19.339
- Well, it really turns me on.
- Well, is that all it takes?

04:19.423 --> 04:21.009
Not quite. Come here.

04:22.635 --> 04:26.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, settle down, guys.
You're embarrassing Brenda.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.807
Should we shut the door?

04:27.890 --> 04:30.977
No, we were just practicing
for my corporate retreat next weekend.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.063
- Oh, where is it this year?
- Palm Springs.

04:34.147 --> 04:36.983
- I want to go.
- Sorry, strictly adults only.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.776
Yeah, we can see that.

04:40.611 --> 04:45.616
Would you be terribly disappointed if
we skipped town and left you two alone?

04:48.703 --> 04:50.079
I think we can handle it.

04:59.213 --> 05:00.506
Mango!

05:02.258 --> 05:03.676
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:03.759 --> 05:05.094
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

05:05.177 --> 05:09.265
- Right on time for a fresh batch.
- Brenda, it's good. Taste.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.395
- This is great.
- Brandon, here you go.

05:14.478 --> 05:18.607
<i>Specialty of the house.
Mucho marvelous mango margaritas.</i>

05:19.442 --> 05:20.693
No, thanks.

05:21.068 --> 05:23.863
A man who doesn't like
his drinks sweet. Okay, well, that's cool.

05:23.946 --> 05:26.949
- Donna's got a stocked bar.
- Oh, take whatever you want.

05:27.032 --> 05:30.077
Like I'm sure
my parents would ever notice. No.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.164
- I'll just have a Coke.
- A Coke?

05:33.247 --> 05:35.749
Leave him alone, Steve.
He doesn't want to drink. Big deal.

05:35.833 --> 05:39.753
Yeah, I think that Brandon's afraid
there's a wild man lurking inside of him.

05:40.087 --> 05:42.965
Well, at least let me make you
a virgin margarita.

05:43.632 --> 05:44.717
Whatever.

05:51.598 --> 05:53.350
Kelly, I thought you didn't drink?

05:53.434 --> 05:55.561
My mother drinks. I sip.

05:59.189 --> 06:01.859
Man, Walsh is a major buzz-crusher.

06:02.359 --> 06:03.694
Not for long.

06:06.446 --> 06:09.158
- Man, he's gonna taste that.
- No, he won't.

06:24.756 --> 06:27.217
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.391
<i>One mucho marvelous virgin mango
for the young man who doesn't drink.</i>

06:34.474 --> 06:36.726
Well, what can I say?
I don't like the taste.

06:36.810 --> 06:37.936
Me either.

06:40.397 --> 06:42.107
Hey, that's pretty good.

07:12.721 --> 07:15.056
Brandon, what are you doing out here?

07:15.473 --> 07:17.642
Feena Farris has been eyeing you
all night.

07:17.725 --> 07:20.979
Feena Farris has been eyeing
everyone all night.

07:21.688 --> 07:23.273
How many of those have you had?

07:23.356 --> 07:25.108
This is my second, Mom.

07:25.191 --> 07:26.818
And why don't you have a real one?

07:26.901 --> 07:28.987
Because I'm the designated mom.

07:30.697 --> 07:33.491
I didn't know Steve and Kelly
were back together.

07:33.575 --> 07:35.410
Look, it's a party.

07:35.535 --> 07:38.288
They're allowed to have fun
and talk and stuff.

07:39.831 --> 07:41.958
Half an hour, Bren.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.378
Fine, just do me a favor.

07:45.461 --> 07:48.673
- Loosen up a little. Please?
- Okay. Okay.

08:07.692 --> 08:09.360
Hey, thanks, Steve.

08:10.111 --> 08:12.613
That's from the virgin batch, right?

08:13.864 --> 08:16.117
Same as the last.

08:19.704 --> 08:21.914
What, what, what? What's so funny?

08:26.585 --> 08:28.295
Did you spike my drink?

08:29.797 --> 08:31.048
Yeah.

08:31.132 --> 08:33.592
Look, we just wanted you
to have some fun.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.720
- Let's go.
- Brandon.

08:36.804 --> 08:38.806
Brandon, relax.

08:39.014 --> 08:40.890
Look, it was a bad joke.

08:42.809 --> 08:44.144
Sorry.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.606
Man, just let him go.
He's ruining the party.

08:47.690 --> 08:51.443
- Stay, Brandon.
- Come on, Steve said he was sorry.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.447
Look, if it's such a big deal,
I'll get you a Coke.

09:00.452 --> 09:03.580
- Get me another drink, please?
- What do you want?

09:04.039 --> 09:06.708
No. No, it's fine.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.838
In fact, I... I like it.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.262
Party machine!

09:18.345 --> 09:21.014
Get this man another margarita! Yeah.

10:06.559 --> 10:07.852
Don't hit the wall.

10:10.313 --> 10:12.107
I cannot believe it.

10:12.190 --> 10:16.027
I mean, all Kelly talks about
is how much she cannot stand him.

10:17.028 --> 10:20.365
Hell, all women want is sex.
It's disgusting.

10:20.448 --> 10:22.408
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey.

10:28.122 --> 10:30.041
Hey, hey, straighten up.

10:30.124 --> 10:32.335
You know Mom's sitting on the sofa
reading that same book

10:32.418 --> 10:35.088
she was reading
when we were in eighth grade.

10:40.468 --> 10:41.844
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

10:41.928 --> 10:46.307
Oh, hi. I just got into this novel.
It was so good, I couldn't put it down.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.312
Well, I'm zoned. Good night.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.899
It is so cute how you still wait up for us.

10:54.982 --> 10:57.693
Oh, honey, I wasn't waiting up for you.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.823
- So, how was the party?
- Fun.

11:02.532 --> 11:04.158
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:25.721 --> 11:26.806
Jim?

11:28.057 --> 11:29.266
Are you awake?

11:29.392 --> 11:32.019
No. I'm dreaming about Palm Springs.

11:32.770 --> 11:35.606
Honey, the kids just got home
from their party.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.318
I smelt liquor on Brenda's breath.

11:40.653 --> 11:41.904
Are you sure?

11:42.488 --> 11:44.198
What are we gonna do?

11:45.241 --> 11:46.367
What about Brandon?

11:46.450 --> 11:48.577
Oh, you know
how Brandon feels about drinking.

11:48.661 --> 11:51.372
I mean, Brenda's the one
who's impressionable.

11:51.872 --> 11:54.083
Maybe you should talk to her
before she goes to sleep.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.628
Cindy, it'll be all right.
We'll talk to her in the morning.

12:00.881 --> 12:02.508
What are we gonna say?

12:04.468 --> 12:08.138
We'll think about it tomorrow. Sleep.

12:18.065 --> 12:20.984
<i>And now we return to The Love Boat.</i>

12:24.821 --> 12:27.074
I wish I could go to Palm Springs.

12:27.282 --> 12:30.619
If you guys see Sonny Bono,
please get his autograph.

12:31.495 --> 12:35.165
Brenda, your mother smelt alcohol
on your breath last night.

12:35.248 --> 12:36.875
Were you drinking, Brenda?

12:36.958 --> 12:39.002
I had one sip of somebody's margarita.

12:39.086 --> 12:40.754
They were serving liquor at this party?

12:40.837 --> 12:43.507
Come on, Dad, you never drank
when you were my age?

12:43.590 --> 12:46.343
Well, we took some beer runs
to Wisconsin,

12:46.426 --> 12:48.386
but that was when legal drinking
was 18.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.222
I had one lousy sip.

12:50.764 --> 12:53.183
I think you guys are making a big deal
out of nothing.

12:53.266 --> 12:54.935
It is a big deal.

12:56.228 --> 12:59.189
Fine. Point made. I'm sorry.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.239
So, did I miss something?

13:07.322 --> 13:10.992
Brandon, were you aware
that your sister was drinking last night?

13:12.327 --> 13:14.746
I think she had one drink, yeah.

13:14.954 --> 13:17.040
Brandon, you know the rules.

13:17.624 --> 13:20.126
I probably
should've said something to her,

13:20.210 --> 13:22.420
but I didn't think it would do any good.

13:22.504 --> 13:24.339
Well, when we're out of town
next weekend,

13:24.422 --> 13:27.717
we really need you to hold down the fort
and keep better tabs on her, okay?

13:27.801 --> 13:30.678
- All right, I will.
- We know you will, honey.

13:30.762 --> 13:34.349
- We'll see you.
- Bye. Have a good game.

13:34.432 --> 13:35.475
Thanks.

13:41.481 --> 13:44.150
You didn't tell them
anything about me, huh?

13:44.234 --> 13:45.652
You owe me one.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.794
I left the number for the hotel
by the phone

14:02.877 --> 14:04.670
along with the numbers
for the police department

14:04.754 --> 14:06.214
and the nearest hospital.

14:06.297 --> 14:07.882
What about the number for the Marines

14:07.965 --> 14:10.301
in case there's an invasion
or something?

14:10.384 --> 14:11.677
Brandon, look out for your sister,
will you?

14:11.761 --> 14:12.845
- Okay.
- Excuse me,

14:12.929 --> 14:14.805
I think you should be
asking me to look out for him.

14:14.889 --> 14:16.557
How about you look out for each other?

14:16.641 --> 14:19.101
- You both know the rules, right?
- Yeah, how could we forget?

14:19.185 --> 14:21.062
Mom made us write them
on the blackboard, what, 100 times?

14:21.145 --> 14:22.313
- 110.
- No.

14:22.396 --> 14:23.481
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:23.564 --> 14:25.858
- See you Sunday.
- Love you guys. Have a good trip.

14:25.942 --> 14:28.277
- Take care, guys. Bye.
- Bye-bye. Love you.

14:40.623 --> 14:41.707
You're so funny.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.127
Call me. You know the number.

14:46.837 --> 14:48.964
He has been bugging me all week.

14:49.048 --> 14:51.467
I am never taking
another sip of alcohol again.

14:51.550 --> 14:54.511
Well, what did you think was going to
happen when you went to the bedroom?

14:54.595 --> 14:56.096
Fifteen minutes of fun.

14:56.180 --> 14:57.973
A lifetime of regret.

14:58.057 --> 15:00.935
Well, I regret
kissing my mother good night.

15:01.018 --> 15:03.687
She smelt my breath
and I was this close to being grounded

15:03.771 --> 15:05.981
for the whole time they're out of town.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.901
- When are they leaving?
- Oh, they left this morning.

15:08.984 --> 15:10.235
For how long?

15:10.319 --> 15:12.821
Today, tomorrow
and through the weekend.

15:12.905 --> 15:15.741
So, what time
should we tell the people to get there?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.786
- Yeah, I wish.
- Come on, you're not having a party?

15:18.869 --> 15:20.245
What's the problem?

15:20.329 --> 15:23.791
Well, he's just about my age
and his name begins with a "B".

15:25.459 --> 15:27.836
He'll never agree to a party.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.214
Do you want me to work on him for you?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.216
No, let me talk to him first.

15:40.349 --> 15:44.686
- Yes.
- Oh, Jim, this is adorable!

15:44.770 --> 15:48.940
They gave us matching terrycloth robes.
Oh, and all these little toiletries,

15:49.024 --> 15:52.152
the shampoo
and the body lotion, the sunscreen.

15:52.235 --> 15:53.570
How's the bed?

15:56.490 --> 15:59.826
- Is that good or bad?
- You better come see for yourself.

16:01.912 --> 16:04.623
Yeah, I think that'll do just fine.

16:07.834 --> 16:11.171
- "Do Not Disturb" sign.
- Good idea.

16:16.384 --> 16:17.677
I got lonely.

16:19.971 --> 16:23.433
Hi! How y'all doing?
Oh, didn't mean to interrupt anything.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.102
We're your neighbors.
I'm Trudy Barnett,

16:26.186 --> 16:28.396
and this is my husband, Bob,
from the Houston office.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.773
Say, hi, Bob.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.025
He's the shy type till you get him going.

16:32.108 --> 16:34.819
Oh, now, Trudy,
these folks want their privacy.

16:34.903 --> 16:36.988
Oh, pooh!
The whole point of these retreats

16:37.071 --> 16:39.240
is meeting new people
and sharing ideas.

16:39.324 --> 16:41.868
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Well...

16:41.951 --> 16:45.205
We always meet the nicest people
at these corporate retreats.

16:45.288 --> 16:49.000
So. Well, now,
where y'all from, anyhow?

16:58.009 --> 16:59.469
So, which do you want,

16:59.552 --> 17:03.347
chicken tacos or
chow mein with tangy mustard sauce?

17:05.098 --> 17:07.060
How about a baloney sandwich?

17:08.435 --> 17:10.271
Make me one, too, will you?

17:11.856 --> 17:15.358
Man, 10 whole hours and they haven't
called to check up on us yet.

17:15.443 --> 17:18.570
That's because they know
Mr Responsible is on the job.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.824
- You want lettuce?
- A little.

17:22.825 --> 17:26.203
Did I mention to you that
we're having a party here this weekend?

17:26.287 --> 17:27.413
Forget it.

17:27.788 --> 17:29.582
Brandon, come on, we'll keep it small.

17:29.665 --> 17:32.376
- Strictly A-list, like Donna did.
- Forget it.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.713
- What if Mom and Dad find out, huh?
- They won't.

17:36.005 --> 17:37.757
We'll clean up everything
before they get home.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.885
Besides, I already told Kelly
to spread the word.

17:40.968 --> 17:43.262
Well, tell her to un-spread it.

17:43.345 --> 17:45.181
Brandon, it's our turn.

17:45.639 --> 17:48.225
You know, throwing a party
when your parents are out of town

17:48.309 --> 17:50.311
is practically a tradition in Beverly Hills.

17:50.394 --> 17:54.398
It's a great way to let people
get to know you. It puts you on the map.

17:55.482 --> 17:57.610
You're worried about people drinking,
aren't you?

17:57.693 --> 17:59.069
The rules thing.

18:00.154 --> 18:01.655
It crossed my mind.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.116
Nobody said we have to be drinking.

18:04.199 --> 18:05.492
I mean, other people
can do what they want.

18:05.576 --> 18:07.077
They don't have
the same rules as we do.

18:07.161 --> 18:10.664
- Brenda, I promised Mom and Dad.
- Brandon, you owe me one.

18:10.748 --> 18:13.250
- Yeah, I know. But I don't think...
- Brandon, come on.

18:13.334 --> 18:17.629
Don't you get tired of always trying
so hard to do the right thing?

18:20.215 --> 18:21.467
Yeah.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.761
So, what are you afraid of?

18:23.844 --> 18:25.345
Let's have a party.

18:31.101 --> 18:33.687
Jim! Wasn't that bad.

18:34.438 --> 18:37.691
Compared to what?
Having your toenails yanked out?

18:38.358 --> 18:39.735
I like Trudy.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.987
I felt bad lying about our table
being filled tonight.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.864
Me, too.

18:47.951 --> 18:49.411
Knock, knock.

18:49.494 --> 18:53.165
You two are so affectionate. I love it!

18:53.248 --> 18:55.667
Keeps the romance alive.

18:55.751 --> 18:57.627
I thought we had
the lock on that door fixed?

18:57.711 --> 18:59.963
Brought you a little treat
to share with us.

19:00.046 --> 19:02.841
Dom Perignon, '85 vintage.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.969
We really enjoyed y'all's company
this afternoon.

19:06.052 --> 19:10.432
- I hope we're not being too intrusive.
- No, no. Come in. Come in.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.684
You want to hear the latest?

19:12.767 --> 19:14.394
The toilet seat
in our bathroom wobbles.

19:14.477 --> 19:15.812
Five-star resort.

19:15.896 --> 19:18.189
It's like riding the loop-de-loop
at the state fair.

19:18.273 --> 19:20.567
- Am I talking too much?
- Well...

19:20.650 --> 19:22.360
Bob says I scare people off,

19:22.444 --> 19:25.155
but Lord knows I hardly say
half the things on my mind.

19:25.238 --> 19:28.241
I just want people to like me.
Is that so terrible?

19:28.616 --> 19:31.453
- No.
- You are so sweet, Cindy.

19:31.661 --> 19:35.165
You and Jim. You're both very special.

19:35.832 --> 19:39.252
In fact, Bob and I have been talking

19:39.335 --> 19:43.173
about visiting y'all out in Beverly Hills
for a few days after this retreat is over!

19:43.256 --> 19:44.966
Wouldn't that be a hoot?

19:51.306 --> 19:52.724
Well...

19:54.893 --> 19:56.060
Gee.

20:01.691 --> 20:03.151
So, Brandon finally gave in.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.987
But he made me promise
to keep it under 25 people, max.

20:06.070 --> 20:09.240
That's cool, as long
as we meet our quota of cute guys.

20:09.407 --> 20:11.492
I've gotta be at that party.

20:11.576 --> 20:14.620
Have you ever heard
of the word "obsessed"?

20:15.204 --> 20:17.248
Oh, Brenda, there he is.

20:17.832 --> 20:21.919
- Hi, beautiful.
- So, about tonight?

20:22.795 --> 20:23.963
I'm at your disposal.

20:24.046 --> 20:27.341
Whatever you want to do.
Wherever you want to go.

20:27.758 --> 20:30.678
- Well, my parents are out of town.
- Really?

20:30.928 --> 20:33.806
And Brandon and I
are gonna have a party tonight.

20:34.223 --> 20:35.600
Really.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.935
- Hey, D.
- Hey, B.

20:41.647 --> 20:43.107
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:43.190 --> 20:44.316
What are you doing this weekend?

20:44.400 --> 20:46.402
Don't you dare
dump another rush assignment on me.

20:46.485 --> 20:49.029
I'm not. My grandma got me tickets
to the Music Centre tonight.

20:49.113 --> 20:52.408
It's a comedy from New York.
It's supposed to be great.

20:54.118 --> 20:57.580
If you like comedies, that is.

20:57.663 --> 21:00.207
Actually, Brenda and I
are having a little party tonight.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.625
Oh, okay.

21:01.834 --> 21:04.128
It's Brenda's gig,
but you're more than welcome to come.

21:04.211 --> 21:07.298
Well, I got these tickets for the theatre.

21:07.381 --> 21:08.465
Right.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.303
- Well, you can stop by.
- I could stop by.

21:13.304 --> 21:15.306
- So, you'll come?
- I'd love to.

21:16.098 --> 21:18.225
I mean... Yeah.

21:19.101 --> 21:20.227
- Great.
- Great.

21:20.310 --> 21:21.395
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:21.478 --> 21:22.980
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

21:27.025 --> 21:28.652
Should I put out the whole bag?

21:28.736 --> 21:30.154
Might as well.

21:31.113 --> 21:34.491
So, how many people you think
are gonna show? Not too many, right?

21:34.575 --> 21:37.369
Kelly asked about nine or ten people,
and I invited six.

21:37.452 --> 21:38.996
So, not too many.

21:39.454 --> 21:40.539
Perfect.

21:42.875 --> 21:44.042
Who are all these people?

21:44.126 --> 21:46.503
Two hundred and fifty
of our closest friends.

21:46.587 --> 21:48.422
We've got to get rid of some of them.

21:48.505 --> 21:49.798
Be my guest.

21:54.344 --> 21:57.389
- I told you it would be easy to crash.
- Yeah, it's great.

21:57.472 --> 22:01.017
The same people who ignore me
at school get to ignore me here.

22:07.899 --> 22:09.401
Ready for a refill?

22:09.484 --> 22:12.863
- Are you trying to get me blitzed?
- Me?

22:13.822 --> 22:15.365
Okay, just a little.

22:16.992 --> 22:19.077
Excuse me, could I talk to you
for a second, please?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.996
No, no, I'm sorry.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.249
Okay, I asked a few people
from Beverly Hills High.

22:24.332 --> 22:26.251
And you said you weren't going to drink.

22:26.334 --> 22:28.670
My mom drinks, I sip.
There's a difference.

22:28.753 --> 22:31.339
- No, there's not.
- Look, I'm just being social.

22:31.423 --> 22:34.092
Look where being social got you
last weekend.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.887
- What about you?
- I'm not drinking.

22:38.012 --> 22:39.889
Brandon and I made a pact.

22:41.349 --> 22:42.809
Oh, really.

22:45.562 --> 22:47.897
Excuse me. Excuse me.

22:47.981 --> 22:50.275
Hey, am I at the right address?

22:50.358 --> 22:53.653
I was beginning to wonder
the same thing myself.

22:55.572 --> 22:56.990
Oh, my God!

22:58.825 --> 23:01.661
Let's hurry, before they realize
that we ditched them.

23:01.744 --> 23:02.870
Trudy'll never notice.

23:02.954 --> 23:05.665
<i>She's still down there singing
Yellow Rose of Texas, probably.</i>

23:05.748 --> 23:08.876
- Well, we can't be too sure.
- Just let me do one thing first.

23:11.170 --> 23:13.464
Party hotline.
We make all your dreams come true.

23:13.548 --> 23:16.342
<i>- Hello, who is this?
- Mrs Walsh. Hi.</i>

23:17.343 --> 23:20.596
- It's Kelly. How are you?
- Oh, hi, Kelly.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.350
- Is Brenda there?
- Sure. Hold on. It's your mom.

23:25.059 --> 23:28.729
- Mom, hi.
- Oh, hi, honey. Is everything okay?

23:28.813 --> 23:30.815
Yeah, fine, fine.

23:32.275 --> 23:35.027
<i>- How's Palm Springs?
- Oh, we're having a great time.</i>

23:35.111 --> 23:36.737
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

23:36.821 --> 23:38.489
Kelly and Donna just dropped by.

23:38.573 --> 23:41.492
- You gotta get off the phone.
- Donna, turn down the stereo!

23:41.575 --> 23:43.828
Hurry, we've got a real problem outside.

23:45.371 --> 23:47.373
Oh, let me say a quick hello
to your brother.

23:47.456 --> 23:49.166
Ah, no.

23:49.250 --> 23:52.920
No, Mom, he's upstairs
and the pizza man, he just came.

23:53.129 --> 23:55.339
So, I've really, really,
really got to go. All right?

23:55.423 --> 23:57.675
Okay. Well, just tell him we called.

23:57.758 --> 24:00.094
<i>- All right. Give my love to Daddy!
- I will.</i>

24:00.177 --> 24:02.888
<i>- We'll see you Sunday.
- Okay, I love you. Bye.</i>

24:04.640 --> 24:06.100
Everything's fine.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.313
- Here we go.
- Okay.

24:11.772 --> 24:13.274
To beautiful women.

24:20.322 --> 24:21.407
Sequel.

24:21.490 --> 24:24.451
Brandon, I thought
we had an agreement.

24:24.994 --> 24:26.370
First you call me a goody-goody,

24:26.453 --> 24:30.249
and now you get on my case for having
a good time. What's the deal?

24:30.582 --> 24:32.292
I'll show you the deal.

24:54.982 --> 24:56.733
Okay. Okay.

24:56.817 --> 24:58.527
Don't have a cow, man.

24:58.777 --> 25:02.072
No, everything's cool.
We haven't done anything wrong.

25:02.406 --> 25:03.699
What are you talking about?

25:03.782 --> 25:06.827
Half the kids are drinking.
I mean, you're drinking.

25:07.411 --> 25:10.122
- Just let me do the talking.
- Brandon!

25:10.205 --> 25:13.959
Brenda, I'm fine, really.
Dylan, tell her I'm okay.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.627
Hey, I'll tell her
anything you want, buddy,

25:15.710 --> 25:18.463
but, those cops outside
get a whiff of your breath,

25:18.547 --> 25:21.925
it's guaranteed, man,
they'll break up this party, for sure.

25:23.927 --> 25:28.640
Okay. Okay.
Just don't let them in the house.

25:40.151 --> 25:42.028
Is there a problem, Officers?

25:42.112 --> 25:44.197
- Is this your house?
- Yes, sir.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.907
Are your parents home?

25:47.700 --> 25:50.912
No, not right now,
but they'll be back soon.

25:50.995 --> 25:53.123
Yeah. Like late Sunday night.

25:53.206 --> 25:55.792
Look, we've had calls
from your neighbors,

25:55.875 --> 25:59.420
none of them are interested in
attending a rock concert tonight, okay?

25:59.504 --> 26:01.422
I'm sorry. You were right.

26:01.506 --> 26:05.134
My cousin, she begged me
not to pump up the volume,

26:05.218 --> 26:07.303
but since it was her birthday,
you know, I...

26:07.387 --> 26:08.972
Happy birthday.

26:09.305 --> 26:10.390
Thanks.

26:10.598 --> 26:12.225
Turn down the music.

26:12.308 --> 26:13.768
We don't want any more complaints.

26:13.851 --> 26:15.770
No problem, Officers.

26:21.651 --> 26:24.320
- Cousins?
- Well...

26:26.989 --> 26:30.368
- Purple Pleasure, I love it.
- A blend of seven essential ingredients,

26:30.451 --> 26:34.163
- plus vitamins A, B, C, and T.
- T?

26:35.206 --> 26:36.958
- Tequila.
- Tequila.

26:38.084 --> 26:41.170
- Hey, B, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

26:42.255 --> 26:45.633
Hey, Dylan, what you did with
those cops outside was righteous, man.

26:45.716 --> 26:48.094
You know, it's like I been telling Brenda,

26:48.177 --> 26:50.763
sometimes you just gotta
let things happen.

26:51.973 --> 26:53.432
Brandon,

26:54.600 --> 26:57.353
how about laying off the liquid, huh?

26:57.436 --> 27:00.523
- Is this coming from you or Brenda?
- Me.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.484
And her.

27:05.444 --> 27:07.238
How about a cup of coffee?

27:07.446 --> 27:09.323
No, thanks.

27:10.115 --> 27:11.575
Too late for that.

27:16.914 --> 27:19.541
Hey, I was hoping you'd show.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.670
- A few of your friends?
- Well, this is the place to be.

27:22.753 --> 27:24.421
Well, you missed a great play.

27:24.505 --> 27:27.591
Well, you're just in time
for a great party. You want a drink?

27:27.675 --> 27:31.428
- What are you having?
- Purple Pleasure.

27:31.512 --> 27:33.138
Have a sip.

27:35.933 --> 27:38.185
Gross! That's the worst drink
I've ever tasted.

27:38.268 --> 27:39.686
Well, it grows on you.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.355
Like what? Fungus?

27:44.108 --> 27:46.068
- You wanna dance?
- Yes, sure.

27:50.072 --> 27:51.657
This is heaven.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.415
Honey, I see Trudy.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.793
- Where?
- Over there.

28:03.168 --> 28:04.503
Quick. Let's duck down.

28:04.586 --> 28:07.297
It's no use. They're wearing robes.
They're coming this way.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.883
- Let's get out while we still can.
- Oh, honey, we can't do that.

28:09.966 --> 28:11.051
They've already seen us.

28:11.134 --> 28:15.389
- Either I get out or I kill them.
- Just don't be rude.

28:15.472 --> 28:18.100
Honey, we must be
on the same wavelength.

28:18.183 --> 28:20.519
We had been looking all over
for you lovebirds,

28:20.602 --> 28:22.979
to see if you wanted to take
a little splish-splash with us,

28:23.063 --> 28:27.025
and here you are,
right where we were hoping you'd be.

28:27.567 --> 28:29.277
Actually, we were just getting out.

28:29.361 --> 28:32.948
Oh, now, don't you be no
party pooper on me, Jim Walsh.

28:33.031 --> 28:34.866
The fun is just starting.

28:35.242 --> 28:37.494
How are you tonight, Cindy?

28:37.911 --> 28:40.163
I'm fine, Bob. How are you?

28:40.580 --> 28:42.082
I'm game.

28:46.628 --> 28:49.714
Speaking of games,
we've got a tennis game tomorrow.

28:49.798 --> 28:53.927
Oh, come on now, Jimbo.
I've been waiting all weekend

28:54.010 --> 28:58.181
to go around the goosey-goosey,
ducky-ducky with you.

29:01.059 --> 29:03.603
- What's she talking about?
- I don't know.

29:05.980 --> 29:09.150
But, honey, Trudy and Bob
aren't wearing bathing suits.

29:11.027 --> 29:12.445
Oh, my God!

29:25.917 --> 29:28.586
Kelly's as good-looking
as Christie Brinkley.

29:28.795 --> 29:30.630
Well, you're no Billy Joel.

29:31.339 --> 29:33.633
Go ahead, ask her to dance,

29:33.716 --> 29:38.012
<i>or let's go while we can still make it
home in time for Creature Features.</i>

29:38.095 --> 29:41.641
I'd ask her. I just hate this song.

29:43.184 --> 29:44.769
Look, Steve, I'm just
not in the mood, okay?

29:44.852 --> 29:47.605
I don't want to drink, and I don't want to
follow you to the bedroom.

29:47.688 --> 29:51.359
- I just wanna dance.
- That is not all you wanna do.

29:53.402 --> 29:54.987
A little sip?

29:56.989 --> 30:00.743
- Do you want to dance? I love this song.
- Yeah, it's my favorite.

30:04.830 --> 30:08.375
- So, are you glad you came?
- So, I haven't made up my mind yet.

30:08.459 --> 30:10.336
Well, I'm glad you came.

30:12.838 --> 30:17.134
- Brandon, you're drunk.
- So?

30:17.343 --> 30:20.387
So, I've never seen you drunk before,

30:20.471 --> 30:24.266
and, well, the first time I do,
you kiss me.

30:24.350 --> 30:27.144
Why do you have to edit everything I do?

30:27.227 --> 30:29.438
I'm not a newspaper article.

30:29.521 --> 30:32.066
I mean, I finally get to a place
where I can just kick back,

30:32.149 --> 30:33.859
and no one can handle it.

30:33.942 --> 30:36.570
Maybe that's because
you're not handling it.

30:36.945 --> 30:39.573
Look, I'll see you on Monday.
Take care of yourself.

30:41.283 --> 30:44.036
Brandon, Brandon, big-time trouble.

30:44.119 --> 30:46.872
- The liquor is no longer.
- Oh, meltdown.

30:46.955 --> 30:48.499
Know if your parents
have any bottles stashed?

30:48.582 --> 30:50.667
No, no, no. Don't even think about it.

30:50.751 --> 30:55.297
- Time to put plan B into action.
- Plan B?

30:57.799 --> 30:59.885
- You're pretty good.
- I know.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.848
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

31:06.892 --> 31:08.060
This is your house,

31:08.143 --> 31:11.813
your party and you have the right
to pull the plug whenever you want.

31:11.897 --> 31:14.149
I'll give it to 12:30.
But then they've all gotta go.

31:14.232 --> 31:15.442
All right.

31:15.776 --> 31:18.904
Well, maybe 1:00,
but that is the absolute latest.

31:18.987 --> 31:20.113
All right.

31:20.739 --> 31:23.825
- What if they don't want to leave?
- Then we'll have a slumber party.

31:23.909 --> 31:25.327
Dylan.

31:25.452 --> 31:28.705
Don't worry.
I'll help you kick them out myself,

31:28.789 --> 31:30.540
for a small nominal fee.

31:32.626 --> 31:37.130
- And what do you want?
- You know, the usual.

31:52.228 --> 31:55.315
Okay, here's the plan, soldier.
We'll go to my house to get the booze,

31:55.398 --> 31:57.901
and you go to the market, get munchies
and fruit punch.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.611
We'll meet back here in 15 minutes?

31:59.694 --> 32:01.029
I'll be waiting.

32:37.315 --> 32:38.941
Wanna try again?

32:39.901 --> 32:41.694
Why beat a dead horse?

32:43.196 --> 32:45.531
Every time I close my eyes, all I can see

32:45.615 --> 32:49.160
is Trudy and Bob begging us
to play bucking bronco.

32:52.121 --> 32:54.498
They seemed so normal.

32:54.832 --> 32:58.002
I mean, I know they were
a little too friendly,

32:58.377 --> 33:01.213
but who would have thought
that meant they were...

33:01.297 --> 33:02.506
Kinky!

33:04.633 --> 33:06.761
If that's them,
I'm going straight to the management.

33:06.844 --> 33:07.970
Jim.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.806
It's almost 2:00 in the morning,
for God's sake!

33:13.517 --> 33:14.602
Hello.

33:14.769 --> 33:16.604
Mom, it's me.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.272
Hi, Brenda.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.234
<i>- Sorry to call so late.
- What's wrong?</i>

33:23.194 --> 33:25.362
Brandon was in a car accident tonight,

33:25.446 --> 33:26.906
<i>but he's okay.</i>

33:28.282 --> 33:30.284
Brandon was in a car accident.

33:31.285 --> 33:33.078
Brenda, what happened?

33:34.872 --> 33:38.334
He was driving alone,
so I don't really know,

33:38.751 --> 33:40.252
but he's all right.

33:41.879 --> 33:43.964
Where is Brandon now, honey?

33:46.216 --> 33:47.301
Brenda?

33:50.304 --> 33:51.555
<i>Brenda?</i>

33:52.431 --> 33:54.141
He's in jail, Daddy.

33:57.227 --> 33:59.480
They arrested him for drunk driving.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.816
<i>I'm really sorry, Dad.</i>

34:37.934 --> 34:40.520
- Hey, get your hands...
- Keep going down the hallway.

34:40.603 --> 34:42.772
- Just get your hands off me, all right?
- Let's go.

34:44.274 --> 34:47.360
- This isn't happening to us.
- Oh, yes, it is.

34:49.362 --> 34:52.072
It's like your worst nightmare come true.

34:54.034 --> 34:55.118
No.

34:55.994 --> 34:59.539
A parent's worst nightmare
is ID-ing your child at the morgue.

35:04.252 --> 35:05.795
Oh, my God!

35:16.347 --> 35:17.765
Are you okay?

35:18.016 --> 35:20.852
Yeah. A few cuts and bruises,
a little headache.

35:21.394 --> 35:23.563
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

35:26.983 --> 35:31.070
Well, now I know why convicts
risk their lives to escape from prison.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.699
How was your retreat?

35:34.782 --> 35:36.743
Brandon, come here.

35:38.661 --> 35:40.371
I'm sorry, Dad.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.542
Don't worry. We'll get through this.

35:44.625 --> 35:47.211
Look, let's just go home
and get some sleep,

35:47.295 --> 35:49.464
and we can talk about this later.

35:49.922 --> 35:51.674
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.846
They're going to take my license away,
aren't they?

35:56.929 --> 35:58.931
I think you can count on that.

35:59.849 --> 36:02.560
That's the last time I throw a party.

36:03.019 --> 36:04.103
Party?

36:05.313 --> 36:06.480
What party?

36:08.107 --> 36:11.277
What a mess! This house is a wreck!

36:11.360 --> 36:14.030
What happened here?

36:16.741 --> 36:18.743
I invited a few friends,

36:19.243 --> 36:21.036
and it got a little out of hand.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.997
A little out of hand?

36:25.166 --> 36:27.960
You and your friends trashed this place.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.963
The stains
aren't gonna come out, Brenda.

36:31.046 --> 36:32.590
Dad, they weren't my friends.

36:32.673 --> 36:35.467
Well, they were at our house,
without our permission,

36:35.551 --> 36:38.596
drinking beer and wine
and whatever else you were serving!

36:38.679 --> 36:40.723
We weren't serving anything.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.476
A hundred and fifty extra people
showed up at the same time.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.062
Some of the guys brought liquor.
What were we supposed to do?

36:47.146 --> 36:48.689
Lock the door.

36:48.814 --> 36:51.400
Is that what you and your friends did
when you went on your beer runs?

36:51.483 --> 36:53.277
No. We went back to our frat house,

36:53.360 --> 36:56.113
we didn't go to our parents' house
when they were out of town!

36:56.196 --> 36:58.073
- Look, Dad...
- No, you look.

36:58.157 --> 36:59.658
You look me in the eye

36:59.741 --> 37:03.245
and tell me, how are we ever
supposed to trust you kids again?

37:04.913 --> 37:07.624
We can't go out of town
for a lousy vacation

37:08.292 --> 37:10.168
without you sneaking behind our back.

37:10.252 --> 37:11.670
That's not fair.

37:13.046 --> 37:15.424
- I didn't break the rules.
- Brenda!

37:15.674 --> 37:18.635
- I wasn't drinking.
- How do I know you're telling the truth?

37:18.719 --> 37:21.096
Brenda wasn't drinking, Dad.

37:22.514 --> 37:23.724
I was.

37:23.890 --> 37:27.019
I know. I read the police report.

37:27.102 --> 37:29.146
Why were you drinking, Brandon?

37:29.938 --> 37:31.648
You don't know
how much pressure there is

37:31.732 --> 37:33.734
for guys to drink these days, Dad.

37:33.817 --> 37:35.986
No, no, that's not it.

37:37.362 --> 37:40.615
It just... I can't explain it.

37:40.699 --> 37:42.492
Well, you better try, Brandon.

37:42.576 --> 37:44.202
Because ever since you threw up
at Foster's Lake,

37:44.286 --> 37:47.581
you have made a big point
of telling us how drinking is stupid.

37:47.664 --> 37:49.791
You promised us
you wouldn't do it again.

37:49.875 --> 37:51.668
And I never did

37:53.169 --> 37:54.754
until last night.

37:55.005 --> 37:57.424
And it was only because some jerk
handed me some punch

37:57.507 --> 37:59.467
and didn't tell me it was spiked.

37:59.551 --> 38:03.054
By the time I knew what it was,
I was already halfway looped.

38:03.388 --> 38:05.598
And now I'm gonna have a record.

38:07.308 --> 38:09.686
So, I guess you could say I screwed up.

38:11.354 --> 38:14.149
I guess you could say I'm not perfect.

38:15.692 --> 38:17.068
Nobody is.

38:19.487 --> 38:22.240
But why did you have
to get behind the wheel?

38:36.546 --> 38:39.215
I could turn this
into a tandem bike, if you want.

38:39.298 --> 38:41.009
Unless, of course,
you wanna buck the odds

38:41.092 --> 38:44.220
and go try and
get your driver's license again.

38:50.810 --> 38:52.562
Why are you looking at me like that?

38:52.645 --> 38:55.273
I stood up for you this time.
I didn't let you take the fall.

38:55.356 --> 38:57.108
Why did you lie to them?

38:57.191 --> 38:58.943
It wasn't exactly a lie.

38:59.026 --> 39:00.945
Nobody spiked your drink, Brandon.

39:01.028 --> 39:03.072
- They did at Donna's.
- Yeah,

39:03.239 --> 39:04.657
and then you went on to down a few

39:04.740 --> 39:06.325
without anyone holding a gun
to your head.

39:06.409 --> 39:07.535
Fine.

39:07.618 --> 39:09.787
Brandon, what's going on with you?

39:10.121 --> 39:13.082
What's going on is that I'm coming off
the worst night of my life,

39:13.165 --> 39:16.085
and if I have to bend the chronology
of my downfall to get through it,

39:16.168 --> 39:19.005
I'd hoped you could cut me
a little bit of slack!

39:39.316 --> 39:41.318
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:41.819 --> 39:43.112
I...

39:43.779 --> 39:47.324
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

39:47.408 --> 39:48.867
I'm getting there.

39:51.286 --> 39:53.580
Look, about the other night...

39:54.832 --> 39:56.208
I'm sorry.

39:57.543 --> 39:58.711
It's okay.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.630
I'm just glad you're okay.

40:02.464 --> 40:03.841
Me, too.

40:16.687 --> 40:18.647
So, are we grounded forever?

40:18.730 --> 40:21.400
Well, we have to pay
to have all the carpets cleaned,

40:21.483 --> 40:23.610
and replace everything that broke,

40:23.694 --> 40:26.989
so I could conceivably be babysitting
until I'm 45.

40:27.739 --> 40:30.951
Well, everybody is saying
it was the best party of the year.

40:31.034 --> 40:33.120
Yeah, well, I'll tell my parents,
they should be thrilled.

40:33.203 --> 40:34.413
Yeah.

40:34.538 --> 40:37.290
<i>Everyone carries a special song
in their heart.</i>

40:37.624 --> 40:41.420
<i>- This one is for us, Kelly.
- What?</i>

40:46.967 --> 40:51.012
Don't look at me.
I am off the party circuit.

40:51.429 --> 40:55.809
- Can't say I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, you're better one-on-one, right?

40:55.892 --> 40:57.727
How's Brandon doing?

41:16.746 --> 41:18.915
Talk about a fender bender.

41:20.750 --> 41:23.336
Brenda told me everything
worked out all right at the hearing.

41:23.419 --> 41:25.463
Yeah, in three weeks
I can apply for permission

41:25.547 --> 41:28.258
to drive to and from work and school.

41:28.424 --> 41:30.969
But till then it's back to bicycle basics.

41:32.095 --> 41:35.098
Well, look at it this way, you were lucky.

41:36.641 --> 41:37.850
I know.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.020
I'm lucky I wasn't killed.

41:41.104 --> 41:45.108
I was going to say, you're lucky
you didn't kill someone else.

41:45.233 --> 41:47.944
Yeah, I gotta look
on the bright side, right?

41:50.571 --> 41:53.282
Or the dark side.

41:54.992 --> 41:57.078
Most people think I don't even have one.

41:57.161 --> 42:00.164
Oh, Brandon, everybody has one.

42:00.289 --> 42:02.917
You just hide it better than most.

42:06.087 --> 42:08.089
You're not doing so good, huh?

42:10.591 --> 42:12.260
Did you ever spend the night in jail?

42:12.343 --> 42:15.304
That's one pleasure
I have managed to avoid.

42:15.388 --> 42:17.098
It's indescribable, man.

42:18.140 --> 42:21.310
Twenty minutes in a cell alone
feels like 20 years.

42:22.144 --> 42:23.270
It's unreal.

42:23.354 --> 42:24.563
Scary, huh?

42:24.647 --> 42:27.316
No. What was scary was
when I hit that truck.

42:28.734 --> 42:30.778
I thought I was gonna die, man.

42:32.363 --> 42:34.990
And I can't get
that sound out of my head.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.909
And I'm sick of every...

42:38.619 --> 42:40.663
I mean, my parents have been cool,

42:40.746 --> 42:44.291
but it's like there's still this big cloud
looming over my house

42:44.375 --> 42:47.795
with this huge neon sign
flashing the word "disappointment".

42:48.545 --> 42:50.297
I know that cloud.

42:50.464 --> 42:53.550
Why does everything I do
have to affect them so much?

42:56.887 --> 42:58.430
It's my life, right?

42:59.848 --> 43:02.851
I swear, I feel like going out right now
and getting drunk

43:02.935 --> 43:05.396
just to show them I can do what I want.

43:09.775 --> 43:11.610
I know just the place.

43:13.737 --> 43:15.405
Where are we going, man?

43:15.948 --> 43:18.659
I see enough of this place
during the day.

43:19.535 --> 43:21.912
My name is Bill, and I'm an alcoholic.

43:21.995 --> 43:23.080
- Hiya, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

43:27.417 --> 43:30.128
Hi, I'm Katy.

43:30.921 --> 43:32.464
I'm an alcoholic.

43:32.631 --> 43:34.299
- Hello, Katy.
- Hi, Katy.

43:36.343 --> 43:40.639
Hi, I'm Jason, and I'm an alcoholic.

43:41.390 --> 43:43.266
- Hi, Jason.
- Hi, Jason.

43:44.351 --> 43:45.644
Hi, everybody.

43:45.852 --> 43:48.939
I'm Dylan, and I'm an alcoholic.

43:49.022 --> 43:51.107
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi, Dylan.

44:13.713 --> 44:16.508
I never knew
so many kids had a problem.

44:19.302 --> 44:22.138
Which is basically what
you're trying to tell me, isn't it?

44:22.222 --> 44:24.265
It's like I said before,

44:24.641 --> 44:26.017
I've been there.

44:28.478 --> 44:29.562
Thanks.

44:30.563 --> 44:31.898
Anytime.

44:47.580 --> 44:48.831
Oh, hi.

44:51.834 --> 44:55.254
I was getting into this novel
your mom recommended.

45:00.718 --> 45:05.640

45:07.850 --> 45:11.479
Yeah, me, too,

'cause

45:17.401 --> 45:21.072

45:23.991 --> 45:25.743

45:26.994 --> 45:28.621
How'd you know?

45:28.704 --> 45:31.290
Believe it or not,
I was your age once, too.

45:31.499 --> 45:33.626

45:34.043 --> 45:36.337
So will you, Brandon.

45:37.305 --> 45:43.693
