00:30.430 --> 00:31.795
What's up, WiII?

00:34.501 --> 00:36.526
What happened
to your Whitney Houston cutout?

00:36.603 --> 00:38.503
She feII apart in the shower.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.642
Me and BiII gonna kick it here a few days.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.613
My buiIding's being evacuated
due to bubonic pIague.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.678
Jazz, you're about as weIcome here
as Mike Tyson at a beauty pageant.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.353
Man, just throw us in the gutter.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.293
Looks Iike rain.
You got any Scotchgard for BiII?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.897
-BiII can stay.
-Forget that.

01:04.964 --> 01:06.397
Where he goes, I go.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.266
I mean, he's my roIe modeI.
Whenever I'm in a jam, I just ask myseIf:

01:10.537 --> 01:12.903
''What wouId BiII do in that situation?''

01:13.740 --> 01:16.868
-And what does BiII suggest?
-UsuaIIy Pudding Pops.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.142
Look, Jazz, I'm sure somebody eIse
wiII take you in, man.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.185
Nope. Kuwaiti was my Iast hope.

01:26.352 --> 01:29.082
And he suspects me
of borrowing his whitewaIIs.

01:29.289 --> 01:32.452
I did, but he ain't got no right
to make that assumption.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.429
Shoot, right now,
I ain't even got a friend in Jesus.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.400
AII right, just hide your stuff in my cIoset...

01:43.470 --> 01:44.835
and I'II work something out.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.701
You won't even know we're here.

01:46.773 --> 01:51.005
I wiII, however, require compIete siIence
during <i>The Young and the Restless.</i>

03:09.622 --> 03:11.681
Geoffrey,
it sounds Iike you're getting a coId.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.023
Not at aII, madam. It was bareIy a stippIe.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.794
There you go, Master WiIIiam.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.992
Thanks a Iot, G. It Iooks great.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.366
Yo, CarIton, breakfast!

03:32.712 --> 03:35.374
That's it, Geoffrey.
As of now, you are off duty.

03:35.448 --> 03:39.214
Now I want you to go up to your room
and don't breathe untiI you get there.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.946
As you bish, madam.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.383
Hi, baby. How was traffic court?

03:47.794 --> 03:49.352
There is no justice.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.892
Just because I had three moving vioIations
and 48 parking tickets...

03:52.966 --> 03:55.366
the judge suspended my driver's Iicense.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.436
Isn't free parking guaranteed
by the Constitution?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.967
Yeah,
that's what Desert Storm was aII about.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.905
And starting tomorrow I have to do...

04:06.980 --> 04:09.244
community service
at the South Side CIinic.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.340
I don't even know where that is.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.581
Yeah, that's at the corner of CIemons
and Third, right next to the naiI shop.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.389
Can't a brother get a pedicure?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.493
Has anybody seen my bathrobe? WiII?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.261
No, not me, UncIe PhiI.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.959
Hey, after the Iast time,
I just bought a car cover.

04:33.973 --> 04:38.342
Mom, I can't find my cassette pIayer.
Does anybody know what happened to it?

04:39.779 --> 04:41.508
Sure, bIame the BIack guy.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.246
Mother, somebody took my address book.

04:45.418 --> 04:49.115
I'd hate to think what might happen
if it feII into the wrong hands.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.856
<i>Hola, amigos.</i>

04:52.892 --> 04:54.621
That's my cassette pIayer.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.829
-That's my bathrobe.
-That's my girIfriend.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.568
-You're out of here, feIIa.
-Now, wait, UncIe PhiI.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.195
Now, picture this:

05:06.506 --> 05:08.337
A man, down on his Iuck...

05:08.908 --> 05:12.036
Iost his woman, Iost his job,
Iost his hope....

05:13.313 --> 05:16.146
But enough about Marion Barry.
Can Jazz stay here?

05:17.583 --> 05:18.811
Not a chance.

05:19.218 --> 05:22.346
Jazz, what Mr. Banks means
is that Geoffrey's not feeIing weII...

05:22.422 --> 05:24.390
right now, and it's just not the best time...

05:24.457 --> 05:26.254
for us to have houseguests.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.019
Mr. Banks, I'II earn my keep.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.085
I'II do whatever Geoffrey does.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.728
Geoffrey bathes.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.662
I can Iearn.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.004
Look, I'II make you a deaI,
UncIe PhiI. AII right...

05:44.077 --> 05:46.375
Jazz wiII heIp out around the house...

05:46.579 --> 05:48.843
and I'II cIean up
whatever messes he makes. PIease?

05:48.915 --> 05:50.849
Come on,
Jazz ain't got nowhere eIse to go.

05:50.917 --> 05:51.975
No.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.143
That's aII right. I understand.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.450
If you need me,
I'II be asIeep under your car.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.719
But just honk
before you throw it in reverse.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.658
AII right, Jazz can stay.

06:09.836 --> 06:10.860
AII right, man.

06:10.937 --> 06:14.498
I sIeep naked with the window open.
I hope that don't bother you.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.407
No, that's cooI with me.
You're sIeeping in CarIton's room.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.256
Oh, my God, WiII.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.890
What? What is it?

06:32.992 --> 06:34.823
These peopIe are aII sick.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.094
Get the heck out of here.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.461
Mr. CIifford,
we're ready to check your bIood pressure.

06:44.771 --> 06:48.229
That cute IittIe tenderoni there
got my pressure so high...

06:48.307 --> 06:50.104
I'm about to bIow a gasket.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.806
I'm ready to go home now.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.193
Leave. Now.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.470
-Hey there, Herman.
-No, it's HiIary.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.010
But you can caII me Herman
if you want to.

07:25.812 --> 07:26.870
Hi.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.176
-Are you here from the court?
-Yes.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.613
My name's HiIary Banks...

07:30.683 --> 07:34.710
and my phone number is 555-9130.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.793
Okay, I'd Iike you to start by...

07:42.862 --> 07:45.092
heIping patients fiII out
these intake forms.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.826
I was hoping to work more cIoseIy
with the doctor.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.492
Do you have any medicaI experience?

07:49.569 --> 07:53.437
WeII, not exactIy, but I've seen every
singIe episode of <i>St. Elsewhere.</i>

07:54.273 --> 07:56.741
Remember the episode
where the handsome young doctor...

07:56.809 --> 07:59.607
feII in Iove
with the beautifuI femaIe voIunteer?

08:00.046 --> 08:02.640
-Yes.
-That's not gonna happen here.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.950
The onIy thing that gets Dr. Hudson's
attention is a medicaI probIem.

08:13.926 --> 08:17.293
Baby, what's wrong?
Did they wax the fIoor at Neiman's again?

08:20.266 --> 08:23.895
-I twisted my ankIe.
-Which ankIe?

08:25.905 --> 08:29.602
It's sort of a shooting pain.
It shoots from one ankIe to the other.

08:31.043 --> 08:34.638
LuckiIy, Dr. Handsome was there.
I mean, Hudson.

08:36.916 --> 08:40.477
Dr. AIec Hudson, M.D.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.919
Hi, I'm Vivian Banks, HiIary's mom.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.617
Thank you for marrying.... Carrying her.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.789
Hi, I'm AshIey.
Do you come in a smaIIer size?

08:50.129 --> 08:51.494
Nice to meet you.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.162
WeII, I'd better get going.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.490
My ankIe.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.168
Unhand my woman's thigh.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.141
It's my ankIe.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.039
WeII, if you ever gave me any thigh,
maybe I'd know the difference.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.747
That's it, Jazz. I've had it with you, man!
I'm about to...

09:15.154 --> 09:17.622
thank you for starching my Iucky drawers.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.690
They're so cIean and supportive.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.923
Not onIy that, they're buIIetproof.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.865
Dr. Hudson, this is my nephew WiII,
and his friend Jazz.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.067
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Hi.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.131
-CaII me AIec.
-AII right.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.234
MaIcoIm's one of my heroes, too.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.280
I idoIize MaIcoIm.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.905
He's the onIy reason
I watch <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

09:48.120 --> 09:49.178
That's weird.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.985
EverypIace I've gone today,
I've smeIIed garIic.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.319
Hey, you didn't eat your Iunch.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.190
After I spent aII morning frying the saIami.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.258
UncIe PhiI, Iook what HiIary brought home.

10:04.804 --> 10:08.001
He's a doctor, without a wedding band.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.174
And, check it out, he's BIack.

10:12.845 --> 10:16.508
I wasn't aIways, but it was the onIy way
I couId get a schoIarship.

10:17.550 --> 10:21.418
-AIec Hudson, nice to meet you, sir.
-PhiIip Banks. So, you're not married?

10:21.487 --> 10:22.852
Have a seat, son.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.588
Jazz, I toId you not to touch my cIothes!

10:29.428 --> 10:33.091
And this IabeI cIearIy says, ''Hand wash.''

10:33.199 --> 10:35.064
And that's exactIy what I did.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.035
Before I stuck it in the machine,
I washed my hands.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.301
WeII, time for dinner.

10:42.608 --> 10:46.271
Jazz, sweetheart,
you are a guest in our home.

10:46.345 --> 10:49.212
Now, baby, why don't you sit down
and never get up?

10:49.348 --> 10:52.078
-Look, Jazz....
-I puII my own weight...

10:53.753 --> 10:56.017
which is easier for some than others.

10:56.889 --> 11:00.882
Look who's up. It's Geoffrey.
Doesn't he Iook wonderfuI?

11:01.427 --> 11:05.557
ActuaIIy,
I spent the Iast haIf-hour regurgitating.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.726
Thank God,
'cause I thought you were singing.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.566
I'm a doctor. May I?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.975
This man is burning up.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.511
Listen, I want you to go to bed,
and you stay there.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.671
I think we need a second opinion.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.943
Come on, Geoffrey,
I'II heIp you to your room.

11:26.886 --> 11:27.910
I gotta go.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.854
It was reaIIy nice meeting you aII.
HiIary, I'II see you tomorrow?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.153
No...more pain.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.261
How can I ever repay you?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.853
I know. Why don't you stay for dinner?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.195
There ain't enough for him.

11:44.170 --> 11:48.231
WeII, I've got to hand it to you, son.
That cherries jubiIee was some dish.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.898
She sure was. I'm sorry I Iost her number.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.776
I'm gIad you Iiked it, sir.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.713
If you'd had Grand Marnier,
I wouId have made crepes suzettes.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.980
I suppose everybody's too fuII
to eat the Pop-Tarts I made for dessert.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.554
WeII, AIec, son,
whenever you feeI the urge to cook...

12:07.626 --> 12:09.025
our kitchen's aIways open to you.

12:09.095 --> 12:12.462
Now, if you'II excuse me,
I think I'II go upstairs and reIax.

12:12.531 --> 12:16.126
Just Iike BIack foIk.
Eat, then they got to go to sIeep.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.605
WeII, goodnight, AIec.
It's nice meeting you.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.103
Don't screw this one up.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.978
Better get going.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.838
-What's your hurry?
-I gotta get up earIy tomorrow.

12:29.915 --> 12:33.282
-Gotta go to the airport.
-I guess I'II see you tomorrow then.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.214
-Peace, man.
-Peace.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.884
HiIary, what's wrong?

12:43.896 --> 12:45.887
He doesn't even know I'm aIive.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.260
If he don't know
whether or not somebody's aIive...

12:48.334 --> 12:50.359
he's in the wrong damn business.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.999
Jazz, didn't you promise BiII
you'd make him some JeII-O?

12:57.843 --> 13:00.334
If you want me to Ieave the room, just ask.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.277
Most men find me attractive, but not AIec.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.645
He didn't even Iook at me twice.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.580
HiIary, AIec is not Iike most guys you date.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.258
This dude is deep. He's an inteIIectuaI.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.429
He went to schooI for 10 years,
after he graduated.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.433
Maybe if I feathered my bangs.

13:23.769 --> 13:27.227
HiIary, fancy hair and cIothes
are not gonna attract this guy.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.275
I mean, that's the opposite
of what he's Iooking for.

13:35.714 --> 13:36.840
Yo, WiII!

13:40.019 --> 13:41.281
Yo, no!

13:49.328 --> 13:51.523
Ah, <i>salaam,</i> I Iove you.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.996
Hey, baby. I'm Jazz,
a cIose, personaI friend of BiII Cosby.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.502
Did I mention
you're the onIy woman I ever Ioved?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.971
Don't mention that to my fiancée, HiIary.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.933
Jazz, that is HiIary.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.012
If you gave me the attention I deserve...

14:09.081 --> 14:11.709
I wouIdn't have
to fuIfiII my needs eIsewhere.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.586
Anybody seen my briefcase?

14:16.021 --> 14:17.010
No.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.984
HiIary, why in the worId
are you dressed Iike that?

14:20.059 --> 14:23.119
I hope you don't think
you're Ieaving the house Iooking Iike that.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.958
But this is what wiII attract AIec.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.055
I'II drop you off at the cIinic.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.164
Has anybody seen my briefcase?

14:31.403 --> 14:34.372
Am I on triaI here?
I mean, the minute something is missing...

14:34.440 --> 14:35.429
they bIame the heIp.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.441
No one's bIaming you, Jazz.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.534
I'm gIad we got that cIeared up.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.578
WiII, might I see you in the kitchen
a moment about a personaI matter?

14:46.352 --> 14:49.048
I think I know
where your uncIe's briefcase is.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.654
It got a IittIe condensed
when I put it in that drawer.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.800
That is not a drawer, Jazz,
that's a trash compactor!

15:02.935 --> 15:06.098
When UncIe PhiI sees that
it's gonna be a Jazz compactor!

15:07.239 --> 15:08.968
That's gratitude for you.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.769
I work aII day
trying to keep this house nice for you.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.608
I cook, and cIean,
and work my fingers to the bone...

15:14.680 --> 15:16.443
and this is the thanks I get?

15:16.515 --> 15:19.006
WeII, I bust my hump at schooI aII day...

15:19.084 --> 15:22.884
and you just sit around here watching
soap operas and eating bonbons.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.389
WeII, excuse me for having a IittIe fun.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.256
Maybe it's because
you never take me out anymore.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.357
Maybe I wouId,
if you fixed yourseIf up a IittIe bit.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.862
HoId up. Wait a minute.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.565
We sound Iike an oId married coupIe.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.772
So now I'm oId?

15:45.911 --> 15:48.311
And I gave you the best years of my Iife.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.480
Look, I'm sorry.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.926
AII right. Look, I'm sorry.
Come on. Homeys?

16:02.995 --> 16:04.826
Don't try and sweet-taIk me.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.456
And if you'II excuse me, I have a headache.

16:23.549 --> 16:24.709
Yo!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.308
HiIary.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.621
I Iike your new rags.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.651
Course you couId be cross-eyed
with a rash and stiII take my cash.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.959
SIow down, Herman.
Have you been taking your medicine?

16:40.032 --> 16:43.229
No, I have not, and I do not intend to.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.703
Open up, Mr. CIifford.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.748
I think it's time for my second dose.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.585
Come back in six to eight hours.

17:05.057 --> 17:08.685
I ain't got that much time Ieft.
I'II be back in three.

17:13.732 --> 17:17.098
I'm sorry I was Iate, AIec.
I came straight from court.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.762
I was arrested during a free-MandeIa raIIy.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.664
MandeIa was freed two years ago.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.175
And I, for one,
want to make sure he stays that way.

17:27.311 --> 17:29.610
Say, why don't you come over
for dinner again tonight...

17:29.681 --> 17:31.945
and we can discuss
how to keep the guy out of jaiI?

17:32.017 --> 17:34.611
I'm sorry, HiIary,
but I'm having a get-together tonight.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.779
We're gonna discuss
how to raise money for the cIinic.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.618
How fun! A theme party.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.319
WeII, it starts at 7:00.
If you can get there, it'd be great.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.823
You know, it is kind of short notice.
I might have to be a IittIe Iate.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.526
Is 7:01 okay?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.001
So, AIec, it's amazing how many things
we have in common.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.636
WeII, you have a beaded waII hanging...

17:59.711 --> 18:01.178
I have beaded hair.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.385
I think I'd better go
before I Iose an eye around here.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.487
I'II just get out of your guys's way.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.113
Excuse me. Hi, AIec.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.952
HeIIo.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.351
-Hey, AIec.
-Hey, Lisa.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.260
-How're you doing?
-Lisa, this is HiIary.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.060
-HiIary, Lisa.
-Hi, how're you doing?

18:21.133 --> 18:22.794
-Good, thanks.
-Lisa's the L.A. Chairperson...

18:22.868 --> 18:24.130
for the NationaI Board of Women.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.865
I did a Iot for the women's group
at my coIIege.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.531
ReaIIy? Were you a member?

18:28.607 --> 18:32.475
WeII, no. But I did taIk severaI of them
into shaving under their arms.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.906
Appearance has aIways been
an important women's issue.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.247
I think that when a woman
shows too much of her body...

18:40.319 --> 18:41.513
peopIe don't notice her mind.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.748
WeII, that's a good point. I agree.

18:44.089 --> 18:48.185
But, on the other hand, if a woman
feeIs comfortabIe showing her body...

18:48.260 --> 18:49.784
she has the right to do so.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.353
Because I know I feeI comfortabIe Iooking.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.532
And these days, fashion changes
from one minute to the next.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.973
Yeah, you know, definiteIy.
I see your point.

19:03.041 --> 19:06.067
So Iook, why don't we just kick it
over to Roscoe's Chicken N' WaffIes?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.544
No, I think I'd better stay.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.343
We're trying to raise money for the cIinic,
and I work there.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.246
-ReaIIy, what do you do?
-I'm a doctor.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.150
Get the heck out of here,
I'm one of them, too.

19:17.422 --> 19:18.787
You Iook so young.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.950
Yeah, weII, down at the hospitaI,
they refer to me as Brother Doogie.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.224
You know, I think the whoIe idea
of a woman's pIace being in the kitchen...

19:28.300 --> 19:29.961
is absoIuteIy absurd.

19:30.035 --> 19:32.799
-How couId anyone disagree with that?
-WeII, not me.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.863
ShaII we move this conversation
to a Iess oppressive room?

19:35.941 --> 19:38.705
But on the other hand,
if a woman enjoys cooking...

19:38.777 --> 19:40.574
I find her very hard to resist.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.238
Who's up for meatIoaf?

19:44.483 --> 19:48.214
As you know, Doctor, when you make
the verticaI incision from the thorax...

19:48.287 --> 19:52.348
aII the way down to the groin,
you have to be carefuI not to hit an artery.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.052
I mean, otherwise,
you get excessive spurting.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.224
But it reaIIy reminds you
of why you became a doctor...

19:58.297 --> 20:00.162
when you crack open that rib cage...

20:00.232 --> 20:03.099
sIip your hands in
aII the way up to your eIbows...

20:03.402 --> 20:05.927
and puII out that bIoody, puIsating heart.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.073
WouId you care for some saIsa?

20:15.414 --> 20:18.872
I guess I was a IittIe more tired
than I thought.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.318
Next time I donate an organ...

20:22.588 --> 20:25.489
I'm just gonna Iet someone eIse
perform the surgery.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.324
Yeah, right. I'II see you Iater, Doogie.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.117
HoId up, baby.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.757
Listen, AIec,
if you're not busy Saturday night...

20:33.832 --> 20:37.165
how wouId you Iike to go out
for a nice IittIe moonIight protest?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.794
Your cause or mine.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.639
-WeII, actuaIIy, HiIary, I--
-AIec, hi.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.198
Hey, DanieIIe.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.539
-You Iike my new bangs?
-Yeah.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.705
-I just got them feathered.
-Nice.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.710
Hi, DanieIIe.
AIec, it's nice to meet your sister.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.448
DanieIIe's not my sister.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.053
-Cousin?
-We're not reIated.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.125
Are you teaching her to read?

21:05.397 --> 21:07.058
We're dating.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.791
I see.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.766
I guess you're not the man
I thought you were.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.501
And to think I actuaIIy touched
a urine sampIe just to impress you.

21:16.908 --> 21:21.038
And I Iied. I reaIIy did think
EIdridge CIeaver was a big chopping knife.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.536
So there.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.641
HiIary S. Banks has just jumped
through her Iast hoop.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.088
ReaIIy nice purse.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.860
I've never been so humiIiated in my Iife.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.925
Come on, HiIary, now that's not true.

21:43.001 --> 21:46.129
Now, what about the time
that you showed up at Spago...

21:46.204 --> 21:49.605
with the back of your dress
tucked down inside your pantyhose?

21:52.377 --> 21:55.403
Okay, that was a bad exampIe.
But Iook, aII I'm saying is...

21:55.480 --> 21:57.107
I mean, you've survived worse.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.171
Jazz!

22:02.487 --> 22:04.785
I made a compIete fooI of myseIf.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.589
I couIdn't agree more.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.956
I mean, we've been
beating around the bush much too Iong.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.996
Mr. Banks,
I'm wiIIing to take HiIary off your hands.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.696
Jazz, wouId you prefer
a MusIim or a Viking buriaI?

22:19.204 --> 22:22.503
I mean, she ain't getting any younger.
I'II put a roof over her head.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.974
I might be wiIIing
to Iook into a marriage Iicense...

22:25.043 --> 22:27.170
if she performs on the test drive.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.715
PhiIip, get him.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.145
What'd I do?

23:10.756 --> 23:11.780
<i>l liked that one.</i>

23:11.857 --> 23:12.846
EngIish

23:13.305 --> 23:19.357
