But you have nothing
to fear, my son.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.410
I won't let any harm
come to you.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.376
Declaring war
on Quinn and Sunny.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.281
Whoever is left, they're gonna
come for you next.

that she's still alive.

(SCOFFS) What kind of
a mother do you think I am?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.375
I don't know what
I think you are anymore.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.379
First you betray Veil.
Then Sunny.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.847
Now your own Regent?

03:36.517 --> 03:38.619
You and Quinn
deserve each other.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.256
I'm done.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.225
How would you
like to be a Baron?

03:47.361 --> 03:49.797
Now, that's what you've always
really wanted, isn't it?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.499
Instead of whispering
from the shadows

03:51.532 --> 03:52.833
like some tired old man.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.669
What the hell
are you talking about?

03:57.371 --> 03:58.539
Well, the other Barons
are all but dead.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.240
Someone has to take
their place.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.444
Well, I thought there
were no Barons

04:03.477 --> 04:05.413
in your perfect new world,

04:05.446 --> 04:07.247
only free women and men.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.750
Or have you forgotten
about that already?

04:10.551 --> 04:13.020
You're the one who told me not
to burn it all down at once.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.856
Who knows what might
rise from the ashes?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.427
These people, they don't know
how to live free.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.628
We have to teach them.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.864
That's why I need somebody
who will treat his Barony

04:23.897 --> 04:25.433
with fairness and equality.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.266
Ah.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.471
Someone who
answers to you. A puppet.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.906
Call it what you like.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.975
You'll have
your own territory,

04:35.008 --> 04:36.377
your own Clippers...

04:36.410 --> 04:37.911
What makes you
so sure I won't use

04:37.945 --> 04:39.480
those Clippers against you?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.583
Quinn told me that
you were a traitor.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.852
But I think that
you're a survivor.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.457
And I'm the only way
to survive what's coming next.

04:55.763 --> 05:00.000
The enemy we are about to face
is unlike any other.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.904
He is the greatest killer
I have ever trained.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.475
But I remind you of that

05:07.508 --> 05:10.411
which is more dangerous
than any killer...

05:11.078 --> 05:14.648
A man who is willing
to die for his principles.

full of gods-in-waiting?

Why don't you tell your men
what this place really is?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.066
Their tomb.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.971
I saw what you're planning.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.475
Your mind must be more
diseased than I thought.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.613
If you would risk the lives
of everybody here,

06:19.647 --> 06:20.881
everybody...

06:22.450 --> 06:24.918
Just to destroy one man.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.155
The only life that matters
now is Henry.

06:28.188 --> 06:32.426

last one of us to protect him.

the heart to kill me,

to the Master's will.

you wanted to save Sunny

about the compass?
