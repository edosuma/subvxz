00:06.698 --> 00:08.933
<i>Previously on "Masters of Sex"...</i>

00:08.967 --> 00:10.401
Bill!

00:10.435 --> 00:13.004
It happened from time
to time when I was a kid.

00:13.038 --> 00:15.840
Do you think it might have been
triggered by anxiety about the baby?

00:17.209 --> 00:18.910
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

00:18.944 --> 00:19.944
Mother...

00:19.978 --> 00:21.612
What was Bill's father like?

00:21.647 --> 00:24.182
Francis wasn't a bad man.

00:24.216 --> 00:26.217
That's not the same thing
as being a good man.

00:26.251 --> 00:27.552
Nice to meet you.

00:27.586 --> 00:28.820
I'm, uh, Anonymous.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.188
I'm Anonymous, too.

00:33.059 --> 00:35.827
The higher-ups
didn't appreciate the doc's vision

00:35.861 --> 00:36.828
or something like that.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.496
I was so excited about the study.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.664
Sorry it's over.

00:39.698 --> 00:42.400
I can't conduct
my research in a brothel,

00:42.434 --> 00:43.935
and this study will suffocate.

00:43.969 --> 00:46.437
Dear God,
you are a dog with a bone.

00:46.471 --> 00:48.873
You know,
I met a young man at the brothel,

00:48.907 --> 00:50.842
uh, a prostitute, a homosexual.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.610
Men who pay to see him,

00:52.644 --> 00:57.181
they're salesman or lawyers
or a provost of a major university.

00:57.216 --> 00:59.517
I'm begging you to reconsider.

00:59.551 --> 01:02.053
What the hell is this, Bill?

01:02.087 --> 01:03.588
You are Provost Scully's daughter?

01:03.622 --> 01:05.022
Vivian.

01:05.057 --> 01:07.859
You feel like taking your sweater off?

01:07.893 --> 01:08.926
Okay.

01:08.961 --> 01:11.462
I'm sorry about last night.

01:11.496 --> 01:15.366
I was punishing someone,
but it ended up being you.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.069
You and Daddy had a sleepover?

01:18.103 --> 01:19.604
Yes, Daddy slept over.

01:19.638 --> 01:20.738
He slept.

01:20.772 --> 01:22.573
He collapsed the second
his head hit the pillow.

01:22.608 --> 01:24.909
I told you
that you could not stay over.

01:24.943 --> 01:27.345
He's going to think that his
parents have gotten back together.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.807
Hi, Mommy.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.509
Tessie.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.110
What are you doing home?

01:51.145 --> 01:53.513
Daddy dropped us off early.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.082
Dad's not coming in 'cause
he doesn't want a lecture.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.450
Really?

01:57.484 --> 02:00.119
Tessie, can you hand me a towel,
sweetie?

02:00.154 --> 02:02.155
Dad wants to live here.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.925
How come you let Dad sleep here
sometimes and sometimes not?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.327
Henry, he slept here once.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.362
Now, let me have the bathroom
to get ready, okay?

02:09.395 --> 02:10.395
I've missed you guys.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.965
I want to hear all
about your weekend.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.433
You can tell me over breakfast.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.569
We already had breakfast.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.805
Why are you always so mean to Dad?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.006
Henry, I'm not mean,

02:20.040 --> 02:21.507
and if that's
what he's been telling you...

02:21.542 --> 02:22.709
One weekend with Dad

02:22.743 --> 02:26.846
is better than a million days
here with you.

02:29.817 --> 02:33.286
24 weeks means it's
officially the size of a cantaloupe.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.955
Last time it was a navel orange,

02:35.990 --> 02:38.191
and the time before that
was a grape.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.028
Listen for yourself?

02:48.736 --> 02:51.070
Is that the heartbeat?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.909
It sounds like a submarine.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.245
Everybody loves
the second trimester.

02:59.279 --> 03:00.346
Nausea subsides.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.948
You get a boost of energy.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.182
Feet are still visible.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.018
I can still see my toes...

03:05.052 --> 03:06.119
Barely.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.155
We will fix that soon enough.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.958
Next checkup is at 26 weeks.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.293
Counting the days.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.997
We've been trying for six months
since the wedding night.

03:18.032 --> 03:21.901
We know we're young,
but we felt the calling.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.071
Well, youth
is the best ally to fertility.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.439
Your menses are regular?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.209
Your monthly cycle?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.346
We've prayed on it...

03:33.380 --> 03:34.647
Like Abraham and Sarah.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.316
She was barren,
but she never lost faith.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.118
The Lord gave them descendants

03:39.153 --> 03:41.587
as countless as the sand
on the seashore.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.222
Hebrews 11.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.392
But still,
we are starting to worry

03:46.427 --> 03:50.229
that children may not be in God's plan.

03:50.264 --> 03:53.699
God may have created
the heavens and earth,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.635
but...he's not an obstetrician.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.437
And when you say you're "trying,"

03:57.471 --> 03:59.272
uh, what exactly is your regimen?

03:59.306 --> 04:01.240
Just like the Bible says.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.842
We lie together every night.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.778
The missionary position, I presume?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.052
What positions have you tried?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.690
Positions?

04:17.724 --> 04:19.058
You're joking.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.861
They thought "sleeping together"
meant actually sleeping.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.529
Enoch begat Methuselah.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.531
Elkanah, son of Jeroham,
lay with Hannah.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.401
I finally told him, if you want a family,
forget the good book.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.969
Follow my ten commandments.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.472
Thou shalt have no other gods
besides Bill Masters?

04:32.506 --> 04:33.873
Well, then their faces,

04:33.907 --> 04:35.374
when I explained the nuts and bolts,

04:35.409 --> 04:37.376
the wife looked like
she'd seen the second coming.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.780
Wait till she sees her husband coming.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.081
Bill.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.517
Uh, is your appointment
already over?

04:44.551 --> 04:45.518
Mm-hmm.

04:47.421 --> 04:51.858
Uh, did, uh, did Dr. Haas
take your blood pressure?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.259
And urine?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.261
I'd just as soon
not discuss my urine

04:55.295 --> 04:56.629
with my husband in the hallway.

04:56.663 --> 05:00.032
But, yes, all was tested,
and all is well.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.501
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:01.535 --> 05:04.604
I'm gonna reward myself
with a trip to the nursery.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.205
She loves staring at the babies.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.674
Why wouldn't I?
It's cheaper than a matinee,

05:08.709 --> 05:10.610
and you are guaranteed
a happy ending.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.845
Well, I'm headed that way myself.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.347
Popcorn?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.684
See? Everyone loves babies.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.591
I'm surprised
I had to hear it from Vivian

05:25.626 --> 05:28.494
that your paths had crossed.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.630
It was nothing, really.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.231
Uh, I mean, it was something,
of course.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.166
Your daughter is lovely.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.669
And it was, uh...

05:36.703 --> 05:38.204
What did she say it was?

05:38.238 --> 05:40.840
A date.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.209
It wasn't a date?

05:43.243 --> 05:45.411
I saw her once in the cafeteria.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.946
And then, uh, later, briefly,

05:46.980 --> 05:50.850
and, I guess, again in the cafeteria.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.418
A big eater, are you?

05:53.587 --> 05:56.589
No, although I am a man
of restrained appetites,

05:56.623 --> 05:57.757
for the record.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.991
Well, the truth is,

05:59.026 --> 06:00.893
my daughter thinks you're
the pussy's whiskers...

06:00.928 --> 06:02.828
Always has,
ever since she was a girl.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.530
Well, I'm very flattered.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.999
Of course you are.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.068
She's a special girl.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.270
Always has her heart
right on her sleeve.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.874
Very sensitive.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.109
All I said was,
"Maybe one of these nights,

06:17.144 --> 06:20.780
Dr. Haas will take you out
for an egg cream."

06:24.518 --> 06:26.886
It's inherent to
the process that at some point,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.222
we will have observed
enough of the four stages.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.791
It does seem that each new subject

06:31.825 --> 06:33.993
fits on the already-established curve.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.262
And with this being
our 200th observation

06:36.296 --> 06:37.363
of auto manipulation...

06:37.397 --> 06:39.432
Happy 200th.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.003
Subject F-096...

06:44.037 --> 06:47.139
49 seconds in the excitement phase.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.975
And solidly on the curve,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.944
which further confirms every
masturbatory act we've witnessed

06:51.979 --> 06:53.212
follows this same pattern

06:53.247 --> 06:56.115
of excitement, plateau,
orgasm, resolution.

06:56.149 --> 07:01.254
We have those numbers,
so  let's move on.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.990
Get back to couples.

07:04.024 --> 07:08.261
How does one partner
affect the other's phases?

07:09.496 --> 07:11.797
It's interesting.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.967
The only problem is
it won't be a controlled study.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.871
In fact,

07:18.905 --> 07:23.342
it will be controlled since
we'll follow the same protocol.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.412
Yes, but that doesn't take into account

07:26.446 --> 07:28.614
the factor that we can't predict...

07:28.649 --> 07:30.916
attraction.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.486
Take... Take Langham and Jane,
for example.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.654
Obviously they're attracted...

07:34.688 --> 07:36.155
Where is that in the data?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.523
I don't need data.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.692
I saw him try to pull her
into a janitor's closet.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.627
Just because
you can't reduce it to a number

07:41.662 --> 07:43.796
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.198
"It," meaning what,
uh...chemistry?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.068
Something that can't be
explained or quantified? That...

07:49.102 --> 07:51.370
Yes, that spark.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.578
Attraction has to play
into how a...

07:59.613 --> 08:02.014
how a couple moves through
the stages of sex.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.349
It has to.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.117
How often they climax together...

08:05.152 --> 08:06.552
Climax together.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.754
There's an event
as rare as Halley's comet.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.256
Where's that data?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.591
It's not rare at all
if the couple is well-matched.

08:21.168 --> 08:26.706
Orgasm completed
at two minutes and two seconds.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.177
State of the art.

08:31.211 --> 08:35.081
But a certain amount of chafing
is unavoidable.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.682
Small price to pay for freedom.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.616
Am I right, corporal?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.063
The study is back.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.099
The whole shebang...
Couples and everything.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.433
What wonderful news.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.635
Are you signing up?
Please say "yes."

08:56.670 --> 09:00.439
Virginia hasn't asked me yet,
but heck yes!

09:00.474 --> 09:02.141
Yes!

09:02.175 --> 09:06.178
I haven't been this excited in,
well...you know. You were there.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.115
I've really missed being a pioneer
on the front lines of science.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.017
Right. Me too.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.753
Wear that perfume I like.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.160
Hello.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.062
Hello.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.736
I think there's been a mistake.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.239
No mistake.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.874
What about Jane?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.411
This is your partner for the evening.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.883
Hi. I'm F-102.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.893
Take your time.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.253
Little sleepy, isn't he?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.941
I don't know what, um...

10:41.975 --> 10:45.845
I-I've never not risen
to the occasion...ever.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.013
Ever. Ever.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.817
Well...
There's a first time for everything.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.963
I'm really glad you called.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.265
And I am really glad
you didn't hang up.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.133
I wanted to make up for last time...

11:08.168 --> 11:09.401
Take you on a proper date.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.337
A diner is proper.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.706
A bar is fun.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.709
I thought you'd enjoy an egg cream.

11:16.743 --> 11:19.178
Why would you think that?

11:19.212 --> 11:21.280
I'm about to turn 19, you know.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.649
Two years away from legal drinking.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.452
And I'd hate for somebody
to get the wrong idea...

11:26.486 --> 11:29.588
your father, for example.

11:29.623 --> 11:33.125
Although I'm sure you haven't
said anything to him.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.328
Well, I haven't told him

11:36.363 --> 11:39.999
we were drinking whiskey in
your apartment the other night.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.801
Which is a felony, by the way.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.969
Corrupting a minor.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.773
That was a lapse in judgment.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.342
One of several.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.677
And I apologize.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.048
Too bad my father's not here.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.217
That's who your apology is really for,

11:58.251 --> 12:03.789
because you're afraid maybe I'll talk,
maybe he'll fire you.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.492
Vivian, no, that is not it.

12:06.526 --> 12:10.396
It's...a little bit it, but mostly...

12:10.430 --> 12:13.465
You are beautiful and charming

12:13.500 --> 12:16.302
and someone who deserves
a steady boyfriend.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.004
Who says
that that's what I want?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.440
I mean, is that what you want?

12:22.809 --> 12:25.578
Someone steady?

12:25.612 --> 12:26.879
No.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.682
I'm definitely not
the settling-down type.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.750
Then why should I be?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.218
I'm young.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.521
I have everything ahead for me.

12:35.555 --> 12:40.225
Why are you so sure I can't have
a casual relationship?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.094
Something fun...

12:42.128 --> 12:44.363
Easy.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.432
Maybe a little bit daring.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.236
Why can't two people
just have a good time

12:51.271 --> 12:53.372
and leave it at that?

13:07.621 --> 13:10.389
So, anything you like, or...?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.724
I like you.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.491
Aah!

13:47.427 --> 13:48.394
What's the matter?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.362
It's good.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.447
Oh!

14:14.154 --> 14:16.055
You can keep going.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.190
Actually, I can't.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.025
Oh.

14:38.812 --> 14:41.013
Obviously I...
I did something wrong.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.083
No, it was...

14:44.117 --> 14:46.552
I'm all wet down there.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.654
That... That's me.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.658
Why are you bleeding?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.438
Is it midnight?

15:07.741 --> 15:11.477
It's not midnight, but it's late.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.117
Honey, what are you still doing up?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.718
Where's Pam?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.887
In with Tessa.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.556
Why do you even bother
coming home at all?

15:28.328 --> 15:32.197
That's not a nice thing to say, Henry.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.766
When Dad lived with us,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.435
you worked at night
and then you worked in the day.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.304
But now you work at day
and at night.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.241
What's the point
of even having a mom?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.077
It probably does
seem like I work all the time.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.178
'Cause you do.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.782
So let's plan something fun.

15:49.816 --> 15:50.983
Tomorrow night.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.084
Come on.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.853
I will have Pam
take you to the hospital.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.455
We'll go eat at Freddy's,

15:56.489 --> 15:59.458
and you can have
all the cherry pie you want.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.595
And then...
we'll ride the Ferris wheel...

16:03.630 --> 16:06.265
just you, me, and Tessie.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.169
But after the Ferris wheel,
I'm gonna go live with Dad.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.583
I don't want to live with you
anymore.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.244
Bill? Bill!

16:52.278 --> 16:53.412
Bill, wake up!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.885
You haven't had a checkup in ages.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.754
Are you sure you shouldn't
see someone about this?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.589
It's not a medical condition.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.459
Doctors being the worst patients.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.162
All they really are are dreams.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.499
Odd dreams.
Standing up, acted out.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.335
I know something's bothering you.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.539
Yoo-hoo!
Let myself in.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.807
So we see.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.375
Good morning, mother.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.544
Good morning, you two.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.180
And you needn't scowl, Billy.
I was invited.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.882
We have a shopping date.

17:29.916 --> 17:34.086
They're doing wonders
with maternity clothes these days.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.722
Lovely fabrics and styles.

17:36.756 --> 17:41.293
Only the best to cover
our darling, little...

17:42.795 --> 17:45.464
You cannot trick us into
blurting out baby names, mother.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.199
Well, I can try.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.902
We can't blurt out baby names
because we haven't picked them,

17:49.936 --> 17:52.237
because your son has been
too busy to discuss them.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.039
Oh, but there's a system.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.408
The first son
after the father's father.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.844
The second son
after the mother's father.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.014
Third son
after the father's eldest brother.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.650
We're not having a litter.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.386
Don't forget
we have the Scullys tonight.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.687
I'm stumped on a gift.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.423
What do you give a couple
for their 30th anniversary?

18:11.457 --> 18:13.425
I think 30 is pearl.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.096
We do need to think
about names, Daddy.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.800
If it's a boy, he can have your name,
but if it's a girl...

18:21.834 --> 18:25.237
If it's a girl,
we can discuss it later.

18:32.879 --> 18:36.882
What I mean is,
Vivian Scully forced herself on me,

18:36.916 --> 18:40.185
which means I am now
completely screwed,

18:40.219 --> 18:43.522
because it turns out
Vivian Scully is...

18:43.556 --> 18:45.490
was a virgin.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.961
You de-flowered
the provost's daughter?!

18:48.995 --> 18:50.195
She duped me.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.730
And now her father
thinks I'm the pussy's whiskers,

18:52.765 --> 18:54.766
and he asked me to their
30th anniversary party

18:54.800 --> 18:55.967
at their country club.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.203
Don't guys like being a girl's first?

18:58.237 --> 19:00.638
Are you crazy?

19:00.673 --> 19:01.873
It's too much responsibility.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.107
Suddenly you're everything.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.043
They want your love, your time,
your devotion.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.879
They're basically glued to you
for the rest of your natural life.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.881
It's like those signs
you see in thrift shops.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.683
You break it. You buy it.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.686
And they say chivalry's dead.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.821
Scully could fire me
if he finds out.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.057
And if I don't send her flowers
or something...

19:19.091 --> 19:21.459
I'd hope you'd at least
send her flowers.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.062
But... But I don't want
to give her the wrong message.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.030
I think having sex
with her took care of that.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.365
All right. All right, then.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.404
A dozen roses
seems like I'm chasing her,

19:33.439 --> 19:34.439
but one rose...

19:34.473 --> 19:36.374
One red rose means "I love you."

19:36.408 --> 19:37.909
Scratch that.
What about white roses?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.511
- White is for brides.
- Lavender.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.778
Means "love at first sight."

19:40.813 --> 19:42.247
- Peach.
- For closing a deal.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.450
Are you making this up?

19:45.484 --> 19:46.784
Yellow.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.853
Yellow means friendship.
Send her yellow roses.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.054
But only six, right?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.423
Why is it scientifically impossible

19:52.458 --> 19:54.359
for a man to put himself
in a woman's shoes

19:54.393 --> 19:55.927
even for one second?

19:55.961 --> 19:58.463
Think about how she feels.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.697
How does she feel?

20:02.568 --> 20:03.835
Lousy.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.803
Send her a dozen.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.544
It was sneaky and
under-handed and unprofessional!

20:12.578 --> 20:14.379
I mean, what the hell
were you playing at?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.180
Do I look like a lab monkey to you?!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.783
Some... Some specimen you can
just throw in the deep end!

20:18.817 --> 20:21.719
Hey, exhibit-A,
mate now with exhibit-B!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.087
I'm not a toy!

20:23.122 --> 20:25.156
I'm not a puppet and you...
You are not my puppeteers.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.292
That is a lot of mixed metaphors.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.894
The reason
I couldn't fuck that woman

20:29.929 --> 20:31.896
is because I was expecting Jane.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.199
Nonperformance is an
equally valuable part of the study.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.635
I am not going down on the
record as a "nonperformance"!

20:37.670 --> 20:40.405
It wouldn't be a bell curve
if everyone was at the top...

20:40.439 --> 20:42.307
First of all, Austin, we're sorry.

20:42.341 --> 20:45.743
We were trying to collect data
that wasn't skewed by attachment...

20:45.778 --> 20:47.679
A controlled study.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.314
You should have told me that.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.748
Yes, we should have.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.483
Now you know.
So, last night...

20:52.518 --> 20:55.286
Goes in the shredder!
I am not a sexual lemon!

20:55.321 --> 20:59.223
You could also end
your participation in the study altogether.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.558
I can't end it!

21:00.593 --> 21:02.927
The only way Jane will
sleep with me is in the study.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.163
Austin, this is not a dating...

21:05.197 --> 21:06.331
I-I-I know.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.467
I know where you're going, Bill.
Just spare me.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.605
Okay, look, I'll continue
with this next phase,

21:13.639 --> 21:17.275
but only if...I get to use Jane
as my baseline.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.477
After that, if you're gonna
put me with someone else,

21:19.511 --> 21:21.412
the least you can do is warn me.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.383
God knows I've not been perfect
in my marriage,

21:25.417 --> 21:28.653
but...I do have feelings.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.989
It could have been about
Bill's anxiety.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.057
But why should Billy be anxious?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.192
He has everything.

21:34.226 --> 21:38.096
Fancy job, a beautiful wife,
baby on the way.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.300
In my day, a woman went away
in her fifth month

21:42.334 --> 21:45.003
and didn't come back again
until her tenth.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.372
I think maybe it is about the baby.

21:47.406 --> 21:50.308
Because when I saw him there,
crouched over the suitcase,

21:50.342 --> 21:52.777
I thought,
"Well, he's packed all of my things

21:52.811 --> 21:53.845
"for the hospital...

21:53.879 --> 21:55.947
my maternity clothes,
my toothbrush..."

21:55.981 --> 21:58.116
It was sweet
in a "first-time-father way."

21:59.451 --> 22:02.086
But he also packed
all of the baby's things...

22:02.121 --> 22:04.455
Booties, blankets,
that little lamb night lamp.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.025
Well, he didn't know
what he was doing.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.594
Did he when he was a boy?

22:09.628 --> 22:11.529
Bill said he did this a lot as a child.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.498
Did he?

22:13.532 --> 22:17.435
Well, but it was always
in the cutest way.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.337
Oh, I do remember one thing.

22:19.371 --> 22:22.840
His father and I heard something
in the living room,

22:22.875 --> 22:25.843
we came in
and he was trying to fly a kite.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.679
Got it stuck behind the wireless.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.282
He...

22:31.316 --> 22:36.220
He never did anything disturbed
in his sleep or violent?

22:36.255 --> 22:38.189
Oh, goodness, no!

22:38.223 --> 22:40.391
It was always something darling...

22:40.426 --> 22:43.294
like a little wind-up toy,
tottering about.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.434
I swear, if you hadn't
walked through that door tonight,

22:49.468 --> 22:51.636
I would have joined the priesthood.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.672
You wouldn't last five minutes.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.374
Partners again?

23:19.832 --> 23:22.934
Do you want me
to do anything for you?

23:22.968 --> 23:25.670
To get you ready?

23:25.704 --> 23:27.472
I'm ready.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.539
Is there something I can do for you?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.248
Just a second now.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.753
It's okay. It happens.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.223
Almost there.
One sec... One sec.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.031
Well, he's not adhering
to any pattern now.

24:27.065 --> 24:30.434
None whatsoever.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.142
All right, you two.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.311
Why don't we try another night?

24:40.345 --> 24:41.612
When you're rested up.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.081
Good idea.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.850
Let's get a cup of coffee.

24:49.755 --> 24:53.124
Why won't my dick work?!

24:53.158 --> 24:54.292
Fuck!

24:54.326 --> 24:55.960
It's an ashtray.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.161
Tahitian pearl.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.997
Turns out,
30 is the pearl anniversary.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.900
40 is ruby, 50 is gold.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.936
I suppose 70 is granite.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.938
Matching headstones...
His and hers.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.044
I, uh, I-I did think of a-a girl's name.

25:13.078 --> 25:16.280
Um... Catherine.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.128
Libby Masters!

25:31.163 --> 25:32.997
You are radiant!

25:33.031 --> 25:36.000
Oh, is it revlon or hormones?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.335
Margaret.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.436
Bill.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.571
You should have given her a baby
years ago.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.406
Come, let's get some champagne.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.408
- Is that for me?
Mm-hmm.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.632
Congratulations, Barton.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.333
Bill.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.710
Chancellor Fitzhugh, Ethan Haas...

26:19.745 --> 26:22.713
one of the rising turks
in the department.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.482
Sir.

26:24.516 --> 26:27.018
Watch out for this one, Fitzy.
He's gonna bury all of us.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.186
If he'll be the one
kowtowing to trustees,

26:29.221 --> 26:30.688
I'll help him dig.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.760
Folks.

26:36.795 --> 26:37.895
Everybody.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.401
Every 30 years, Margaret lets me
get a word in edgewise.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.205
And before she changes her mind,

26:48.240 --> 26:50.908
I want to tell you
about my favorite hat.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.443
It was a homburg...

26:52.477 --> 26:55.913
same one that Anthony Eden
used to wear.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.582
This was back
when I was a surgical resident

26:58.617 --> 27:00.952
at the dawn of man.

27:02.187 --> 27:06.624
And this hat, no kidding,
cost more than my car.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.260
But one evening,
I'm walking home in the rain,

27:09.294 --> 27:14.699
and I realize
I'd left my hat at the automat.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.834
By the time I ran back there,
it was gone...

27:16.868 --> 27:18.035
For good, I thought.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.538
Except I had written my name
in the label,

27:20.572 --> 27:22.273
just like my mother taught me.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.844
And a few days later,
I walk out of a fasciotomy,

27:26.878 --> 27:30.181
and there is this girl.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.083
Statuesque.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.718
A vision.

27:33.752 --> 27:39.256
And there in her hands...
the homburg.

27:39.291 --> 27:43.561
I gathered my wits, asked her to dinner,

27:43.595 --> 27:49.567
and the rest, as they say, is biology.

27:51.937 --> 27:55.573
So, after 30 years...

27:55.607 --> 27:59.543
Margaret Scully, my love,

27:59.578 --> 28:02.213
I'm awfully glad I lost that hat.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.647
Oh, you didn't!

28:18.130 --> 28:21.432
So that's the famous Ethan Haas.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.000
I was expecting wings and a halo.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.835
He hasn't spoken to me all night.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.405
Oh, I'm sure Dr. Haas just
doesn't want to seem forward.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.440
Men don't know
what they want, sweetheart.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.108
That's why they have wives
to tell them.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.044
Certainly sounds
like Barton knew his mind

28:33.078 --> 28:34.211
when he picked you.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.480
Oh please.
That old hat story?

28:36.515 --> 28:39.517
Truth is, I showed up at the
hospital every day for two weeks,

28:39.551 --> 28:40.985
and he never once noticed me.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.788
I had to finally pretend
there was a Sadie Hawkins dance

28:43.822 --> 28:44.989
and ask him out myself.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.295
You have to make them love you.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.064
That's the real story.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.671
Vivian, your mother
and father are inside.

29:00.705 --> 29:03.274
So is the chancellor of the university.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.341
You did get my roses, didn't you?

29:04.376 --> 29:05.776
I did.

29:05.811 --> 29:09.947
And I didn't drag you out here
for a repeat of last night.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.515
I feel absolutely dreadful
about that.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.716
If I had had any idea...

29:12.751 --> 29:13.751
It would have happened
the same way.

29:13.785 --> 29:14.952
It wouldn't have.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.655
You just seemed so world-wise
and grown up.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.623
It never occurred to me
that you hadn't...

29:19.658 --> 29:21.125
I seem grown up to you

29:21.159 --> 29:23.060
because that's how
you wanted me to seem.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.496
And I guess that now
I really am grown up.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.700
But I brought you out here
to tell you,

29:29.734 --> 29:31.335
you don't have to worry.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.473
The physical part will get better.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.574
I know it will.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.109
And as for everything else,

29:38.143 --> 29:40.911
well, you have my love and devotion,

29:40.946 --> 29:45.783
because you and I,
we were meant to be together.

30:00.699 --> 30:03.033
This song always makes
my heart melt.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.339
We can still dance, you know,
despite my girth.

30:08.373 --> 30:11.275
I'd rather lure you home instead.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.544
I've got a splitting headache.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.913
Isn't that a girl's excuse?

30:15.947 --> 30:17.982
In this case, it's the truth.

30:20.252 --> 30:24.054
Maybe the sleepwalking
has something to do with Barton.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.390
This iciness between you.

30:27.759 --> 30:30.861
Why won't you tell me
what happened with him?

30:34.833 --> 30:40.404
People are...mysterious creatures.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.478
With you, my dear husband,
being the most mysterious of all.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.819
I'm gonna use the girl's
and let you think about that dance.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.157
Libby.

31:10.902 --> 31:13.237
Hemoglobin, hematocrit,
draw blood and cross match,

31:13.271 --> 31:14.305
then prepare two units.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.639
Go, now!

31:25.884 --> 31:27.518
The most important thing
is the bleeding has stopped.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.953
Could you hear it?

31:28.987 --> 31:30.254
I can't find the heartbeat yet,

31:30.288 --> 31:32.022
but that doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.557
The baby could be in an odd position.

31:33.592 --> 31:37.228
And bleeding doesn't always mean
the end of the pregnancy either.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.829
So...we'll check again later.

31:38.863 --> 31:39.797
Later?

31:39.831 --> 31:40.965
Give it a chance to shift.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.033
In the meantime, you sleep.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.702
I'll give you a sedative
so that's possible.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.837
No, stay with me!

31:46.871 --> 31:49.673
Libby, I-I need to,
uh, uh, go over your chart,

31:49.708 --> 31:50.908
and I need to order you demerol.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.476
I'll... I'll call Virginia...

31:52.510 --> 31:53.777
Have her sit with you
until I get back, okay?

31:53.812 --> 31:57.648
Then I'll stay right here
until you're out, all right?

31:57.682 --> 31:59.750
It could all turn out to be fine.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.318
Completely fine.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.920
Couldn't it?

32:02.954 --> 32:05.522
It could. It could.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.663
They're very excited
about the Ferris wheel.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.966
Even Henry, who likes to pretend
he hates everything.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.468
Yeah, I've noticed.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.837
So, tomorrow
might be another late night.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.740
You don't have to sound
so apologetic, Virginia.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.308
I don't mind the long hours.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.542
Really.

32:25.577 --> 32:26.577
Thank you.

32:33.385 --> 32:36.654
I need a piece of cherry pie
this minute!

32:36.688 --> 32:38.255
How about you guys?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.723
Right now!

32:39.758 --> 32:41.458
Let's go already!

32:48.133 --> 32:50.000
Mom!

32:50.035 --> 32:52.102
Let me just get rid
of this... one minute.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.041
What the hell happened?

32:57.075 --> 32:58.275
You were with her at the party.
I thought you knew...

32:58.310 --> 33:00.444
With her case...
What did you miss?

33:00.478 --> 33:01.812
I didn't miss anything.

33:01.846 --> 33:04.148
Her blood pressure's
been perfect the entire time...

33:04.182 --> 33:05.282
130 over 80.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.884
Urine's been negative...
No sign of protein.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.585
Uterine growth's
been completely normal.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.187
By the fifth month at the umbilicus...

33:10.221 --> 33:11.455
You missed something!

33:11.489 --> 33:13.190
If anything,
I have been overly attentive

33:13.224 --> 33:14.858
knowing I'd have you
breathing down my neck.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.293
Her first fetal heartbeat?

33:16.328 --> 33:17.594
11 weeks.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.729
I also checked her hemoglobin
every four weeks...

33:18.763 --> 33:20.230
No sign of anemia.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.899
Did you check the growth
of her uterus by palpitation?

33:21.933 --> 33:23.233
Of course I palpated!

33:23.268 --> 33:24.501
Bill, do not pin this on me

33:24.536 --> 33:26.904
when what's really eating at you
is your own guilt.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.643
And why would I feel guilty?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.561
You could have been
your wife's doctor,

33:34.601 --> 33:36.714
and you chose not to be.

33:41.186 --> 33:44.321
150 milligrams of demerol
for Mrs. Masters.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.432
Sorry he sent you down here.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.834
Libby...

33:56.868 --> 33:58.569
I would be here anyway.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.604
Because Bill...
Bill can't sit here.

34:00.638 --> 34:01.905
I mean, because if he did,

34:01.940 --> 34:04.308
he'd have to admit he has
no control over any of this,

34:04.342 --> 34:08.245
and he would rather roam
the hallways than face that.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.347
Well...
I think that's all men.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.547
Bill is different.

34:14.351 --> 34:15.886
I've seen it before, you know...

34:15.920 --> 34:18.522
Once right after Bill's father died.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.726
He just fell apart.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.962
Lost his mind.

34:24.996 --> 34:30.199
And I-I couldn't reach him,
and it was so scary.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.437
But I stayed there
and I wouldn't leave

34:33.471 --> 34:36.739
and I wouldn't budge
until he let me in.

34:36.775 --> 34:40.811
And he loves me for staying,
and he resents me for staying,

34:40.844 --> 34:44.547
because Bill doesn't really want
anyone to know him.

34:44.581 --> 34:47.583
It's the same thing
with his sperm count.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.820
Lousy... We both know that.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.221
And he lied to me.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.489
We both know that.

34:53.525 --> 35:00.063
And yet...one lonely swimmer
in that batch of lousy sperm

35:00.098 --> 35:03.667
wanted to fertilize an egg,
and that egg wanted to grow...

35:03.701 --> 35:06.403
in a procedure that involved
a plastic cap

35:06.438 --> 35:09.106
and no actual sex of any kind,
and yet...

35:09.140 --> 35:10.441
I mean, what are the odds of that?

35:10.475 --> 35:13.243
The odds are slim.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.512
Yeah. But it happened.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.615
So this can happen, too.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.918
My baby...

35:20.952 --> 35:23.020
Yes, I know. It is your baby.

35:23.054 --> 35:27.291
And God...I mean,
God cannot be that cruel.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.662
No.

35:54.919 --> 35:59.756
I'm so sorry about the pie, honey.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.493
And the Ferris wheel.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.196
I bet Henry's pretty mad.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.866
He was cursing a lot.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.567
Is he in the bathroom?

36:12.604 --> 36:14.671
Where is he?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.542
It's bad, Mommy.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.177
He ran away.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.013
I've checked every
unlocked door on every floor.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.282
I've looked in the cafeteria,
in processing...

36:25.316 --> 36:26.416
So he's hiding.

36:26.451 --> 36:27.651
He'll come out
as soon as he gets hungry.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.852
No, you don't understand.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.087
I know that he's left the hospital.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.055
I know that he went
to go look for George.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.725
- I don't know George.
My ex-husband.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.894
He even may have... He may have
tried to walk to his apartment,

36:36.928 --> 36:38.729
which is 16 blocks from here,
or gardels.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.430
The nightclub over in coon town?

36:40.465 --> 36:42.599
I need a car.
You have a car.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.167
How does a kid
even know about gardels?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.103
Because George used to play there,

36:46.137 --> 36:47.971
I used to sing there,
we would take Henry.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.606
To gardels... A kid?

36:49.641 --> 36:51.942
I don't need your commentary.
I need your car!

36:51.976 --> 36:54.244
The hospital gives me
a company car for night rounds,

36:54.279 --> 36:56.146
but I'm sure as hell
not giving that car to you.

36:56.180 --> 36:57.848
No, you're going to drive me,

36:57.882 --> 36:59.483
unless you want it to be
on your watch

36:59.517 --> 37:01.151
that an 8-year-old boy disappeared.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.563
What the hell?

37:12.597 --> 37:14.464
The apartment
is on 14th and Green.

37:14.499 --> 37:15.532
We have to start there.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.267
And what if
your husband's not there?

37:17.302 --> 37:19.002
The landlady or the neighbor...

37:19.037 --> 37:20.170
Somebody must have seen him.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.305
Is Henry dead?

37:21.339 --> 37:22.172
Henry's dead.

37:22.206 --> 37:23.707
He's not dead, Tessa!

37:23.741 --> 37:25.008
We just have to find him.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.777
Please, God.
Here, get in here.

37:26.811 --> 37:29.379
Stan, wait up!
Is that Mrs. Johnson?

37:29.414 --> 37:30.714
We're on our way out.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.683
She may want to take this call first.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.664
You had to call her?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.499
Told you I had to.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.569
She just pretends she's worried.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.672
If that is an act,
it is a very convincing one.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.709
She asked me if you were
headed to your dad's.

38:02.380 --> 38:06.049
I always thought my dad
was the greatest guy in the world.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.819
My dad is the greatest.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.021
And my mom, wow.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.289
What a nag.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.424
My mom's a nag, too.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.526
And you know what I wish?

38:16.561 --> 38:19.596
I wish I had a stun gun...
a real one...

38:19.631 --> 38:22.733
to zap my mom
so she'd explode into particles.

38:22.767 --> 38:27.104
Radioactive particles?
'Cause that would kill all life on Earth.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.241
Okay.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.610
At least neutralize her.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.915
But here's the thing...
I know your mom,

38:38.950 --> 38:40.951
and she's a really bad pretender,

38:40.985 --> 38:43.854
which means you really did scare her.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.457
And if something bad
did happen to you,

38:47.492 --> 38:50.427
she really would explode
into particles...

38:50.461 --> 38:52.262
Little tiny pieces

38:52.296 --> 38:55.232
that could never
go back together again.

39:02.206 --> 39:04.341
I want my dad back.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.959
I'll try again in a bit.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.195
In the meantime,
turn on your left side.

39:25.229 --> 39:27.931
That might move things enough
to hear the heartbeat.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.933
Of course you'll hear it.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.268
Of course you will.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.804
Darling, don't worry about anything.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.572
Everything is going to be okay.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.109
Maybe Libby would like
some time to herself, mother.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.945
I wouldn't have called her
if I wanted time to myself.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.680
And I know what we need to do.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.848
We need to pray.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.184
Oh, for God's sake.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.386
It's for Libby's sake, Billy.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.888
And if God wasn't invented
for a time like this,

39:51.923 --> 39:53.790
then why invent him at all?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.695
What do you think, darling?

39:58.730 --> 40:02.599
I could go and get the
hospital chaplain to join us.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.034
Good.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.978
I-I've met the chaplain.

40:15.012 --> 40:18.081
I prefer to keep
my supplications to myself.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.249
I'll be back.

40:19.283 --> 40:20.984
We'll try again later.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.986
Later is now, Bill.

40:23.020 --> 40:26.923
Stop talking to me
like I'm your patient.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.492
You are my patient.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.260
No, right now. This minute.

40:30.294 --> 40:33.263
I am your wife.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.165
And I want the truth.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.137
Is the baby gone?

40:41.572 --> 40:46.343
Lib, there's a protocol...
a process...

40:46.377 --> 40:50.013
to try and determine every few hours
whether there's a viable heartbeat.

40:50.047 --> 40:54.151
No, it's been hours!
And I... I don't want protocol!

40:54.185 --> 40:56.653
Just...

40:56.687 --> 40:58.688
Just look at me.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.058
Just look at me and tell me...

41:02.093 --> 41:03.927
Is this baby gone?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.707
I'm so sorry.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.555
The procedure
is fairly straightforward.

41:31.589 --> 41:34.191
We put you to sleep,

41:34.225 --> 41:38.795
we induce you,
and then it's all over.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.834
I can schedule for the morning.

41:44.869 --> 41:48.572
No, do it now.

42:30.681 --> 42:34.517
Virginia...

42:34.552 --> 42:37.420
It's over now. It's okay.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.889
It's not okay.

42:38.923 --> 42:42.259
I am doing the best that I can,
and it is not good enough.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.060
It's not...

42:59.010 --> 43:01.678
Henry hates me...

43:02.981 --> 43:04.848
because I work all the time.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.585
I don't blame him.

43:12.089 --> 43:14.858
He also hates me for not
letting him live with George.

43:14.892 --> 43:16.760
I can't blame him for that either,

43:16.794 --> 43:19.729
because I could never
tell him the truth that...

43:19.764 --> 43:22.565
that George doesn't want him.

43:26.070 --> 43:30.540
For a weekend, maybe,
but George never wanted kids.

43:30.574 --> 43:31.775
I did.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.982
When he drops them off
after a visit,

43:39.016 --> 43:41.518
I can see the relief

43:41.552 --> 43:46.890
just...wash over George's face.

43:49.927 --> 43:53.396
Kids never want the parent
that's really there for them.

43:53.431 --> 43:56.132
No, kids want both parents.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.168
That's what they really want.

43:58.202 --> 44:03.807
It orders a kid's universe
to have both of their parents there.

44:03.841 --> 44:07.644
It orders an adult's universe, too.

44:07.678 --> 44:10.714
Not meant to do this alone.

44:15.353 --> 44:19.756
My Saturday coming up
is pretty open.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.725
I could toss a ball around with Henry.

44:21.759 --> 44:24.627
Maybe take him
to the science museum.

44:26.630 --> 44:30.000
Ethan...

44:30.034 --> 44:34.671
That's very generous and kind.

44:34.705 --> 44:37.607
You are on your way
to sainthood tonight.

44:39.410 --> 44:43.079
But, honestly, why would you
take on that responsibility?

44:44.215 --> 44:48.018
It's not a responsibility.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.786
I like Henry. He's a good kid.

44:57.028 --> 45:03.533
I think that might
also confuse things between us.

45:03.567 --> 45:07.637
You don't have to worry about that.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.140
I have a girlfriend now...

45:10.174 --> 45:13.043
Vivian Scully.

45:13.077 --> 45:14.811
The provost's daughter?

45:16.881 --> 45:18.715
Good move.

45:23.454 --> 45:25.422
So, you and I...

45:26.991 --> 45:28.691
We can be friends.

45:48.846 --> 45:51.714
Start an I.V... 500cc pitocin.

45:51.749 --> 45:54.284
20 drops per minute
increased to 40 after 5.

45:54.318 --> 45:55.518
Another 150 demerol.

45:59.623 --> 46:01.257
I'll be waiting for you in recovery.

46:01.292 --> 46:05.161
Bill, we didn't make
this baby together.

46:05.196 --> 46:09.532
Not really, we didn't, but...

46:09.567 --> 46:11.835
Can't we at least lose it together?

46:15.106 --> 46:18.308
This one thing...please?

46:45.769 --> 46:48.738
I know you.

46:51.475 --> 46:54.978
Tessa.

46:55.012 --> 46:57.113
Come here.

46:57.148 --> 47:01.417
I was going to take the kids home,
but I can stay if you still need me.

47:01.452 --> 47:04.087
No, that's fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

47:05.589 --> 47:07.924
All right.

47:07.958 --> 47:09.726
Come.

47:38.422 --> 47:39.956
Give me fundal pressure.

47:48.098 --> 47:50.133
Again.

48:01.245 --> 48:02.946
Kelly clamps.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.117
I can cut the cord if it's easier.

48:08.152 --> 48:09.219
I can do it.

48:44.688 --> 48:46.789
One more push for the placenta.

48:58.469 --> 49:00.003
It's done.

49:00.037 --> 49:03.973
You just need to rest now.

49:05.709 --> 49:07.810
What was it?

49:10.347 --> 49:12.315
A girl.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.790
There's more roast, dear.

49:20.824 --> 49:21.658
Potatoes?

49:21.692 --> 49:23.293
I've got a cobbler for dessert.

49:23.327 --> 49:27.397
I'm going to try and get a
few hours' sleep before morning.

49:27.431 --> 49:29.198
Thank you for the food.

49:29.233 --> 49:34.170
It's the least I can do
after such a terrible ordeal.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.975
But you will have another.

49:39.009 --> 49:42.512
I know you will.

49:42.546 --> 49:45.448
We'll have another.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.949
Why would you say that?

49:46.984 --> 49:48.518
Because you will.

49:48.552 --> 49:50.386
And everything will be...

49:50.421 --> 49:52.322
Fine. Everything will be fine.

49:52.356 --> 49:53.456
Why would you say that?

49:53.490 --> 49:55.291
That it'll all be okay.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.060
That we'll have another.

49:57.094 --> 49:58.528
Well, I'm just trying to...

49:58.562 --> 50:01.464
What, make things better
by telling me everything's fine?

50:13.110 --> 50:14.711
We should talk in the morning.

50:18.082 --> 50:19.582
No, let's talk now.

50:19.616 --> 50:21.184
In fact, I got a second wind.

50:21.218 --> 50:22.518
And I'm sleepwalking again.

50:22.553 --> 50:23.920
Did you know that?

50:23.954 --> 50:26.789
Libby's worried about it and
has no idea what it's all about.

50:26.824 --> 50:30.293
But we know what it's about,
don't we?

50:30.327 --> 50:32.995
Sleepwalking?!

50:34.565 --> 50:36.899
When you were small,
it was just a harmless...

50:36.934 --> 50:38.634
Ah! There it is again!

50:38.669 --> 50:42.305
You know, there's a term
for this curious habit of yours, mother.

50:42.339 --> 50:45.141
It, uh... well, we could call it
"wishful thinking."

50:45.175 --> 50:47.310
Or self-delusion.

50:47.344 --> 50:48.678
Or a sickness.

50:49.980 --> 50:51.381
Yeah, our sickness.
Let's call it that.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.416
And you know what's even more
curious about this habit...

50:53.450 --> 50:56.085
this... this sickness of ours?

50:56.120 --> 50:58.821
How it spills over everything.

51:00.891 --> 51:04.527
Infects...everything.

51:06.230 --> 51:08.297
Everyone.

51:17.274 --> 51:19.842
Quite a pair, aren't we?

51:19.877 --> 51:23.513
You with your head stuck in the sand.

51:23.547 --> 51:29.552
And me...
Just a chip off the old block.

51:32.856 --> 51:36.292
Those days are over, son.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.563
They are dead and buried.

52:06.690 --> 52:07.924
Bill...

52:09.993 --> 52:11.928
I just wanted to say...

52:11.962 --> 52:15.031
I am so sorry for your loss.

52:19.436 --> 52:20.970
Actually, I'm...

52:22.172 --> 52:24.073
I'm the one who's sorry, Barton.

52:24.107 --> 52:27.944
Well, I would give you a hug,

52:27.978 --> 52:31.581
but I wouldn't want it
to be misconstrued.

52:34.284 --> 52:39.288
I guess there's enough sorrow
to go around for us all.

52:46.864 --> 52:49.065
Car's parked out front.

52:56.907 --> 53:00.943
I say this, because, uh,
well, I love you, Lib.

53:00.978 --> 53:02.712
I love you with all my heart.

53:05.682 --> 53:08.050
We have to be done with this.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.688
I can't ever see you
go through that again.

53:12.723 --> 53:16.225
So, we have to stop.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.930
But we'll be okay.

53:20.964 --> 53:23.332
Uh...we have each other,

53:23.367 --> 53:27.336
and...that's all we really need.

53:34.411 --> 53:36.312
Let's go home.

53:54.431 --> 53:56.732
I brought you fresh coffee.

53:56.767 --> 53:58.167
Ah.

54:00.370 --> 54:02.071
You seem busy.

54:02.105 --> 54:04.574
I am trying to organize
our couples study...

54:04.608 --> 54:06.475
Refine the pairing system.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.110
Uh, I've decided that, uh,

54:08.145 --> 54:11.314
the criteria for our couples
should be two things...

54:11.348 --> 54:16.152
Similarity of age and anonymity.

54:18.388 --> 54:22.558
That's curious, because I-I
came to the opposite conclusion...

54:22.593 --> 54:25.328
That we should only use
actual couples who are together.

54:25.362 --> 54:26.963
Attached.

54:29.633 --> 54:31.434
No, my way is best.

54:31.468 --> 54:36.872
Actual couples
present too many complications.

54:36.907 --> 54:39.175
All right.

54:39.209 --> 54:41.978
You let me know when
you'd like to resume the study.

54:42.012 --> 54:43.446
Tonight is fine.

54:44.915 --> 54:45.982
No.

54:46.016 --> 54:47.883
We're not working tonight.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.085
It's fine.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.486
You can go back to your desk now,
thank you.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.687
It's not fine...

54:51.722 --> 54:53.522
Bill, you and Libby...

54:53.557 --> 54:57.093
Virginia, am I talking to thin air?

54:57.127 --> 54:58.995
We can resume tonight.

55:03.133 --> 55:07.370
Virginia... Please leave.

55:09.506 --> 55:11.841
I do not want to dis...

55:15.112 --> 55:18.614
It wasn't your fault, you know.

55:25.622 --> 55:29.759
What happened was not your fault.

55:31.061 --> 55:33.295
Wasn't it?

55:33.330 --> 55:35.965
So, whose fault was it?

55:35.999 --> 55:37.633
Libby's?

55:39.136 --> 55:40.202
Yours?

55:42.172 --> 55:43.272
The baby's?

55:43.306 --> 55:45.941
It was no one's fault.

55:45.976 --> 55:48.978
I had, uh,

55:49.012 --> 55:53.282
I had mixed feelings
about being a father.

55:53.316 --> 55:54.450
Did you know that?

55:57.854 --> 55:59.889
Those thoughts were in my head.

55:59.923 --> 56:02.792
And then last night,
Libby stood up and...

56:02.826 --> 56:04.126
Bill...

56:06.396 --> 56:10.266
You are a powerful man,
but you are not that powerful.

56:13.136 --> 56:17.473
Even you can't
think something into being.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.751
Close your eyes.
