00:53.177 --> 00:55.482
That was one hell of a ride, son.

00:56.362 --> 00:57.915
Gil?

00:58.460 --> 01:00.350
Gil, where are you?

01:02.073 --> 01:04.480
<i>Hi, Dad. Sorry I couldn't join you.</i>

01:04.561 --> 01:07.086
<i>Traveling through time is complicated.</i>

01:07.166 --> 01:11.408
<i>The energy is so complex and unstable,
you can only loop back through time once.</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:15.019
<i>Now it's up to you. I installed
a time capacitor in my wings.</i>

01:15.099 --> 01:17.998
<i>It's preprogrammed to take you
to the places I...</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:20.167
<i>You must destroy the First Sharknado...</i>

01:20.247 --> 01:21.802
<i>...and every...</i>

01:21.882 --> 01:24.283
<i>You need a velocity of 88 miles per hour...</i>

01:24.363 --> 01:28.403
<i>...to activate the time vortex in
the wings to make the next jump.</i>

01:28.483 --> 01:30.955
<i>Good luck, Dad. Semper paratus.</i>

01:32.583 --> 01:35.679
Oh, no, April. Where's the bag?

01:35.759 --> 01:37.266
April?

01:38.261 --> 01:39.847
April?

01:47.474 --> 01:49.341
Oh, boy.

01:56.562 --> 01:59.936
Hey, get away from that!
So we're gonna do this the hard way, huh?

02:04.972 --> 02:07.037
Come back here!

02:14.971 --> 02:16.481
Give me that!

02:17.461 --> 02:19.352
Give it back!

02:20.460 --> 02:22.339
Give it back!

02:57.965 --> 02:59.543
What are you looking at?

03:10.164 --> 03:11.574
Oh. Hi.

03:22.971 --> 03:24.494
Ah, maybe not.

03:48.481 --> 03:51.876
Come on. Give it back. Come on. Come on.

03:52.226 --> 03:54.500
Now you're just pissing me off.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.865
This is mine.

04:22.852 --> 04:25.225
- Nova.
- Hi, Fin.

04:25.305 --> 04:26.972
- You're dead.
- No, you're late.

04:27.052 --> 04:29.950
Yabba dabba doo...

04:36.960 --> 04:39.648
- Hey, Fin.
- Bryan?

04:39.728 --> 04:44.122
Welcome to prehistoric times.
Long way from the Mets Stadium, my friend.

04:44.765 --> 04:46.282
- You're dead, too.
- Nope.

04:46.362 --> 04:49.648
Look, I know this is extremely confusing,
but we're all very much alive.

04:49.728 --> 04:52.669
That's the amazing thing about time travel.
Sometimes you're here.

04:52.749 --> 04:55.586
Sometimes you're there.
Sometimes you're stuck in 1955...

04:55.666 --> 04:58.701
...and your mom's trying to make out with you
at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

04:58.781 --> 05:02.293
Anyway, uh, we've been waiting for Gil to
bring back the final member of our gang.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.386
- Gang?
- We're not officially a gang.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.473
It's hard to source matching outfits.

05:06.553 --> 05:08.564
Who else is here?

05:18.790 --> 05:21.663
April on a dinosaur. Huh.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.398
Come on. We gotta go.

05:38.764 --> 05:40.267
Fin!

05:44.318 --> 05:47.591
- Is it really you, April?
- Yes, it's me.

05:49.707 --> 05:52.682
- You're not a robot?
- No, I'm not a robot.

05:52.762 --> 05:56.006
Why would I be a robot?
I mean, my hand, but...

05:57.079 --> 05:59.019
But, baby, you died.

05:59.099 --> 06:02.108
Gil saved me right before
the space shuttle hit.

06:02.188 --> 06:06.277
- Our son saved my life.
- He saved all of our lives...

06:06.357 --> 06:09.667
...pulled us from different points
in time, and sent us back here.

06:15.761 --> 06:17.770
We've been here for a year waiting for you.

06:17.850 --> 06:20.658
Time travel needs work, but we're here.

06:20.738 --> 06:24.802
- An entire year?
- I thought I'd never see you again.

06:24.882 --> 06:28.513
But I have to tell you something.
I did learn how to fly a dinosaur.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.637
- Her name is Ptera.
- Because she's a pterodactyl.

06:33.717 --> 06:35.732
Technically, Pteranodon. She has a tail.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.968
So if you're all here,
does that mean Gil's here, too?

06:38.048 --> 06:40.152
No. Turns out you can
only go back into time once.

06:40.232 --> 06:41.754
Oh, yeah.

06:41.834 --> 06:45.216
That explains why he disappeared
when we landed. But why here?

06:45.296 --> 06:48.759
To do what we do best, save the world.

06:48.839 --> 06:51.071
And to stop the First Sharknado.

06:51.151 --> 06:54.592
Gil said if we stop the First Sharknado,
we can stop them all.

06:55.424 --> 06:58.117
It's like a big game of dominos.
One sets off another...

06:58.197 --> 07:01.637
...and another and another and another
until you just got a big mess.

07:01.717 --> 07:03.015
Dominos sucks.

07:03.095 --> 07:07.154
The world was already destroyed once.
I don't see how we can make it much worse.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.854
We could mess with time so we don't exist.

07:09.934 --> 07:12.861
Look at it this way.
We're already kinda dead as it is, so...

07:12.941 --> 07:15.002
...this is a bonus round.

07:16.068 --> 07:20.030
And by the way, Fin, I know you've been eaten
by a lot of sharks and you've survived...

07:20.110 --> 07:22.969
...but I've actually been eaten
and pooped out by a lot of dinosaurs...

07:23.049 --> 07:26.093
...'cause they couldn't digest me.
It's... it's been rough.

07:27.357 --> 07:28.612
Hand me the capacitor.

07:28.692 --> 07:31.318
It's in these wings.
Gil programmed it for us.

07:32.435 --> 07:34.527
Your kid's awesome.

07:36.082 --> 07:37.683
Incoming!

07:38.518 --> 07:40.212
Crap!

07:43.130 --> 07:44.879
Look out!

07:48.910 --> 07:50.530
Meteorites.

07:50.610 --> 07:53.009
Yeah, like the ones that kill the dinosaurs.

07:53.089 --> 07:55.984
The meteors are gonna kill us
if we don't get out of this time period.

07:56.064 --> 07:58.214
Fin, look!

07:58.594 --> 08:00.446
There it is...

08:01.326 --> 08:03.395
...the First Sharknado.

08:05.824 --> 08:08.117
I'm gonna need a bigger chainsaw.

08:11.438 --> 08:15.431
- We're running out of time.
- Fin, I hope you have a backup plan!

08:15.511 --> 08:18.771
We'll figure it out. We always do.
This won't be any different.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.709
We'll use the meteorites
to kill the Sharknado.

08:26.789 --> 08:28.855
- Yeah, that sounds easy.
- If we do this right...

08:28.935 --> 08:32.400
...they'll act like the bombs we used to
blow up the Sharknado in Los Angeles.

08:33.234 --> 08:35.298
We're going for a ride.

08:39.139 --> 08:41.634
First time ever on a pterodactyl?

08:41.714 --> 08:43.350
Yeah!

08:43.429 --> 08:45.637
- Scared?
- Hell, no.

08:45.717 --> 08:47.487
Get down!

08:49.249 --> 08:51.956
- Whoa.
- There it is, dead ahead!

08:52.636 --> 08:54.916
Hit the meteorites into the Sharknado!

08:54.996 --> 08:57.205
Everyone, move to the left!

09:00.462 --> 09:02.760
Ptera, hit the fireball!

09:05.717 --> 09:07.690
There's more!

09:09.123 --> 09:11.537
It's not working! We need bigger ammo!

09:11.617 --> 09:13.811
We need a bigger explosion!

09:13.891 --> 09:15.355
- I'll be right back!
- Fin, no!

09:15.435 --> 09:18.299
- What are you doing?
- He's being Fin!

09:21.321 --> 09:23.139
- Fin!
- Fin!

09:23.219 --> 09:25.492
- Fin!
- Fin!

09:27.966 --> 09:31.226
- April, try to stay close to him!
- Do you want me to steer?

09:31.306 --> 09:33.115
No!

09:40.132 --> 09:41.667
It's feeding time.

09:46.534 --> 09:49.512
Come on! You've got this, Fin!
Let's go! Let's go!

09:53.713 --> 09:56.122
Gil! Gil, it's your dad!

09:56.202 --> 09:58.638
- Gil!
- Gil!

10:02.312 --> 10:05.153
You got this! Come on!

10:05.235 --> 10:08.933
Gil's safe! That meg's gonna explode!

10:12.219 --> 10:14.101
Bryan, batter up!

10:18.437 --> 10:19.958
Yeah!

10:22.218 --> 10:25.594
It's working! The Sharknado's disappearing!

10:31.716 --> 10:33.865
It's a Timenado.

10:34.825 --> 10:36.738
Let's do the time warp again.

11:45.910 --> 11:48.411
First Sharknado destroyed. You did it!

11:49.852 --> 11:51.717
But where are we?

11:52.810 --> 11:54.909
Is that a castle?

11:55.413 --> 11:57.277
Holy cosmos.

11:57.357 --> 12:00.555
Do it! Come on! Get in there! Pull!

12:00.635 --> 12:02.656
You bore me! Go...

12:03.336 --> 12:06.935
Next. Seriously? This is the guy?
This is the chosen one?

12:07.015 --> 12:08.720
You're doing such a good job, honey.

12:12.129 --> 12:14.151
Look! A dragon!

12:15.131 --> 12:18.693
- The dragon is going to eat us all!
- Run!

12:21.523 --> 12:23.117
Nailed it.

12:31.324 --> 12:32.953
It is time.

12:35.418 --> 12:38.847
- Gil's gotta be here somewhere.
- Ptera's okay.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.858
Ah, I told you I should have steered.

12:41.938 --> 12:46.092
Well, in case you didn't notice, we did bring
a pterodactyl back into the 21st century.

12:46.172 --> 12:49.502
Just saying, maybe not our greatest idea.

12:52.189 --> 12:56.148
Why are you looking at me like you've
never seen me before? It's me, Bryan.

12:56.228 --> 13:00.483
Not exactly, Bryan. I think some things
got mixed up when we jumped.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.157
- What?
- Let's talk about this later.

13:03.237 --> 13:05.202
We got bigger problems right now.

13:08.459 --> 13:11.376
- Who's shooting arrows at us?
- We did what Gil said.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.833
We stopped the First Sharknado.
We should be home.

13:13.913 --> 13:16.514
Ah, this isn't home.

13:20.118 --> 13:22.215
Something's not right.

13:23.218 --> 13:25.702
Hey! Hey, you!

13:26.123 --> 13:28.101
- Don't hurt me!
- Frodo!

13:28.531 --> 13:32.250
Take everything!
Don't use your evil sorcery on me!

13:32.635 --> 13:35.908
Well, that decides it.
We're definitely not home.

13:37.015 --> 13:40.367
Huh. Let's get some of these
clothes on so we can blend in.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.499
Someone's coming.

13:54.057 --> 13:58.457
Halt! You are the prisoners
of the magnificent Morgana.

14:05.332 --> 14:07.347
Okay, everybody.

14:07.427 --> 14:09.042
I got this.

14:09.122 --> 14:13.451
I'm sure you think what you have
to say is very important.

14:13.531 --> 14:16.926
Now kneel before Morgana!

14:17.006 --> 14:19.134
Uh, how 'bout a joke?

14:19.924 --> 14:21.503
Hey!

14:25.476 --> 14:27.737
- Mwah.
- We're not the enemy.

14:27.817 --> 14:31.990
You speak of an alliance,
yet a dragon lay here before you.

14:33.110 --> 14:35.702
- Be careful, Fin!
- Fin!

14:50.918 --> 14:53.296
Stop! Morgana!

14:54.300 --> 14:57.546
Put down your weapons, by order of the King.

14:57.916 --> 15:01.215
Ugh. Those wretched words.

15:03.934 --> 15:07.030
I put a hex on you and you...

15:07.110 --> 15:10.483
...and you and especially you, you cacafuego.

15:10.563 --> 15:13.431
Oh, don't be such a brat.

15:14.011 --> 15:15.463
Bye.

15:18.133 --> 15:22.637
Everyone, you should come with me.
It's far too dangerous here. Come on.

15:23.117 --> 15:25.759
Quickly. You must come and meet my master.

15:25.839 --> 15:28.338
Your arrival has been prophesized.

15:28.418 --> 15:30.150
This looks like Sharknado weather.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.149
No, I thought we got rid of the Sharknados.

15:32.229 --> 15:34.082
Yeah, we also thought we were home.

15:34.162 --> 15:35.696
Hurry!

15:39.425 --> 15:42.515
Welcome to Merlin's castle.

15:42.595 --> 15:44.096
Come.

15:45.265 --> 15:46.769
Nova, look.

15:48.710 --> 15:50.957
You bear the mark of the house of Shepard.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.116
- I am a Shepard.
- My lord.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.658
This is Gil's handwriting.
I've seen this before.

15:59.738 --> 16:02.042
Sir Gil is quite the artist.

16:02.122 --> 16:03.948
These are the same drawings
that are under Stonehenge.

16:04.042 --> 16:06.050
Merlin shall explain all.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.085
Be still!

16:08.831 --> 16:11.410
Merlin, allow me to introduce...

16:11.490 --> 16:13.411
Sir Gil Shepard's parents.

16:13.491 --> 16:16.434
I will go and fetch him
and tell him that the family...

16:16.514 --> 16:20.758
...he's been searching for all these years
has finally found him instead.

16:20.838 --> 16:23.958
Your son trained with me
for the past 10 years.

16:24.038 --> 16:26.359
He's been here for 10 years?

16:26.439 --> 16:29.380
I must confess he's taught me
more than I've taught him.

16:29.460 --> 16:32.107
Fin, look! This is the Einstein-Rosen bridge.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.864
And this right here, it's a wormhole.

16:35.944 --> 16:37.154
How do you know that?

16:37.234 --> 16:39.617
Because I'm a physics teacher...

16:39.697 --> 16:44.576
...which is why Gil chose me,
because I know things.

16:44.656 --> 16:47.500
Okay. The key is high velocity,
which means...

16:47.580 --> 16:52.684
- ...really fast, high, spinning winds!
- A tornado.

16:52.764 --> 16:56.215
Yes. That could be the key
to Gil unlocking the bridge. A-plus.

16:56.295 --> 16:59.233
And make traveling through time possible.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.098
Gil! Master Gil!

17:09.435 --> 17:11.690
Come back! Your parents have arrived!

17:11.770 --> 17:13.855
Danger! Sharknado forming!

17:13.935 --> 17:16.936
- What's in that bag?
- We'll deal with this later.

17:17.031 --> 17:21.535
You've had an unhealthy obsession with that
bag ever since we destroyed the dinosaurs.

17:21.615 --> 17:23.915
- Yeah, seriously, what's in this bag?
- Nova!

17:29.150 --> 17:32.235
Really, Fin? Be more careful.

17:32.315 --> 17:34.336
You're in love with a robot head.

17:36.410 --> 17:38.120
Ow.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.556
Is this me?

17:41.636 --> 17:45.339
That was all that was left of you
after the Earth was destroyed.

17:45.419 --> 17:48.433
You sacrificed yourself trying to save me.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.831
It's not real.

17:51.911 --> 17:55.679
- It's a robot.
- So I was just a head in the future?

17:56.650 --> 17:58.978
I didn't want you to find out this way.

17:59.058 --> 18:00.534
- That hurts.
- Ow!

18:00.614 --> 18:04.452
Maybe she can help us. Her technology
might be able to help get us back home.

18:04.532 --> 18:07.058
- I hope that hurt!
- See, now there's gonna be a throw-down...

18:07.138 --> 18:09.007
...because that head is jealous.

18:10.407 --> 18:13.449
I didn't want to scare you.
That's why I hid it from you.

18:13.529 --> 18:15.401
It's okay.

18:15.873 --> 18:17.753
I forgive you.

18:18.613 --> 18:21.298
- But don't lie to me anymore.
- I won't.

18:22.138 --> 18:24.138
But I'm holding on to her now.

18:24.218 --> 18:26.638
My lord, we must take shelter.

18:26.718 --> 18:29.839
- Where's my son?
- I saw him sailing out to sea...

18:29.919 --> 18:32.390
...and then suddenly there were
sharks falling out of the sky.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.699
I knew this wasn't over that easy.

18:37.414 --> 18:40.006
Gil's heading right into that Sharknado.

18:43.435 --> 18:45.950
- Wait. Stop.
- Nova, get out of the way.

18:46.030 --> 18:48.183
We gotta let him go. If he sees you,
he'll keep looking for you.

18:48.263 --> 18:50.946
- That's exactly what we want.
- But if he reunites with you now...

18:51.026 --> 18:54.430
...he'll stop searching for you, and then you
probably won't even exist in the future.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.050
We could all cease to exist.

18:56.130 --> 18:58.247
I know you're too emotional
right now to see the big picture...

18:58.327 --> 19:03.101
...but take a second to think about it.
What's making Gil travel through time?

19:03.181 --> 19:05.056
- To be with us.
- And if he finds us...

19:05.136 --> 19:06.596
...he'll stop looking for us.

19:06.676 --> 19:09.859
Your son is already disrupting space-time.

19:09.939 --> 19:13.174
Who knows what'll happen if anyone
else gets caught up in that thing?

19:13.254 --> 19:16.293
- And the Sharknados are coming this way.
- Then we have to do something about it.

19:16.373 --> 19:18.194
Follow me.

19:18.274 --> 19:20.535
I'm back!

19:21.315 --> 19:23.246
Morgana.

19:23.326 --> 19:26.559
Oh, my gosh. Winter, how are you?

19:26.639 --> 19:29.903
You still look so... average.

19:29.983 --> 19:33.630
Let's face it. I'm a 10,
and you're like a 1392.

19:33.710 --> 19:37.244
I thought Merlin had sent you
to the land of the undead.

19:37.324 --> 19:39.808
- They were full. Can I come in?
- Absolutely not.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.431
Get out of their way!
There's a Sharknado coming.

19:42.511 --> 19:45.139
Exactly. Listen...

19:45.219 --> 19:50.637
...your silly belief in science is not
strong enough to stop what's coming.

19:50.717 --> 19:54.551
I have magic on my side and a potion...

19:54.631 --> 19:58.515
...that can stop those sharks,
so if you let me work with you...

19:58.595 --> 20:01.138
...we can get this done quickly and easily.

20:01.218 --> 20:04.953
All I want in return
is for you to use your science...

20:05.033 --> 20:07.534
...to release Excalibur.

20:08.435 --> 20:13.453
Magic has no sway over such a powerful tool.

20:14.333 --> 20:18.865
- All right, Morgana. We accept your deal.
- Great. Let's go kill some sharks.

20:18.945 --> 20:22.091
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! Wearing that?

20:22.171 --> 20:27.538
You're going to need to look a little
less needy and a little more knighty.

20:33.234 --> 20:35.890
The end is nigh! Run!

20:46.431 --> 20:49.440
If you're gonna do that
hocus-pocus stuff, now's the time.

20:51.212 --> 20:55.826
Stand back. This is a she-mergency.

21:04.010 --> 21:09.011
- What happened? What did you do?
- What I always do, win.

21:11.527 --> 21:13.555
Dragon sharks?

21:13.635 --> 21:16.720
Good luck with that. Bye!

21:26.258 --> 21:27.748
Shark kebob.

21:29.420 --> 21:33.435
I have a plan. You, go to Camelot,
and you help save the castle.

21:33.515 --> 21:35.171
I will meet you there.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.671
The Devil has come back!

21:55.801 --> 21:57.674
Get out of the way!

22:06.610 --> 22:09.092
Thank goodness you're still here.

22:09.672 --> 22:12.113
I didn't think this was how I'd meet my end.

22:14.328 --> 22:15.825
Load the catapult.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.971
Here! Use this!

22:21.410 --> 22:23.577
Release the catapult!

22:27.775 --> 22:29.296
Freedom!

22:34.791 --> 22:37.798
Fin, we need something more powerful
to destroy the Sharknado!

22:37.878 --> 22:39.760
I have an idea.

22:43.572 --> 22:45.517
- Why not?
- Wait!

22:45.597 --> 22:49.118
Only a man who is worthy
can pull the sword from the stone.

22:49.198 --> 22:51.152
This is my birthright.

23:40.182 --> 23:42.479
- Get down!
- Oh, no.

23:43.570 --> 23:46.574
Aah! I'm melting!

23:53.284 --> 23:56.474
Oh, thank the Lord! Thank the Lord!

23:56.554 --> 23:59.591
Hey! Window for time jump is closing!

23:59.671 --> 24:02.508
T-minus five minutes, 57 seconds.

24:03.288 --> 24:06.554
She wants us to time jump. We need speed.

24:08.175 --> 24:11.274
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no.

24:13.876 --> 24:15.957
Come on. Come on.

24:17.394 --> 24:20.096
Take it easy, Frodo. Sorry about the clothes.

24:20.176 --> 24:21.764
Lower!

24:26.499 --> 24:28.370
Release it!

24:30.095 --> 24:31.801
Cor, blimey!

24:31.881 --> 24:33.790
We're not going fast enough.

24:33.870 --> 24:36.589
Who needs science when you have a dragon?

24:58.181 --> 25:00.845
You all right, April? Nova?
Bryan, you all right?

25:00.925 --> 25:03.398
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- My back's been hurting for years...

25:03.478 --> 25:08.272
- ...but it feels pretty good now.
- Bryan, you're back.

25:08.352 --> 25:09.856
- What?
- You're no longer a woman.

25:09.936 --> 25:11.943
Are you telling us
you don't remember being a woman?

25:12.023 --> 25:13.711
It's the consequences of time travel.

25:13.791 --> 25:17.452
So let me get this straight.
Every time we jump, everything changes?

25:18.255 --> 25:19.912
Time travel's risky.

25:19.992 --> 25:23.010
If we do it right, we can reset
everything back to the way it should be.

25:23.090 --> 25:24.056
But what if we do it wrong?

25:24.136 --> 25:27.701
But what if this is wrong,
and that was right?

25:27.781 --> 25:29.235
We'll talk about it later.

25:29.315 --> 25:31.609
We gotta find out where we landed,
and we gotta find Gil.

25:31.689 --> 25:35.707
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

25:36.087 --> 25:38.667
The British are coming!

25:38.994 --> 25:41.090
The British are coming!

25:43.399 --> 25:45.806
My lord, we'll never make it
through this storm.

25:45.886 --> 25:49.358
Hmm. Maybe we could use it to our advantage.

25:52.007 --> 25:55.592
The sharks are coming! The sharks are coming!

25:55.672 --> 25:59.793
The sharks are coming! The sharks are coming!

26:05.470 --> 26:09.547
That Sharknado might be miles away, but
if it gets any closer, we're all in trouble.

26:09.627 --> 26:12.799
What if Gil unleashed a Sharknado during
the Revolutionary War by accident?

26:12.879 --> 26:14.948
Then there'd be no revolution.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.358
Then America wouldn't exist.

26:20.770 --> 26:22.773
Then we wouldn't exist.

26:24.494 --> 26:26.464
Come on!

26:35.779 --> 26:38.001
I tell you, you're making a mistake.

26:38.081 --> 26:40.101
We're on your side. We're Americans.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.796
I wanna speak to who's in charge.
It's a matter of life and death.

26:42.876 --> 26:46.574
Crinkum crankum! Settle down! Settle down!

26:46.776 --> 26:50.071
Benjamin Franklin, sir, we found
this group outside the docks.

26:50.151 --> 26:54.572
- They claim to be allies.
- Thank you, Private Jebediah Clarke.

26:55.523 --> 26:58.377
- Are you the Jebediah Clarke?
- Yes, I am.

26:59.775 --> 27:02.805
What? I can't say hi to my
great-great-great-great-great-grandpa?

27:02.885 --> 27:05.509
- Give or take a great or two.
- No.

27:05.589 --> 27:07.865
Now who are you, and what is this all about?

27:07.945 --> 27:11.536
- We need to use your cannons, sir.
- Our cannons?

27:11.616 --> 27:14.419
This is General George Washington...

27:14.499 --> 27:16.927
...not some delivery service
for tea and crumpets.

27:19.779 --> 27:21.379
Come out and play!

27:31.770 --> 27:34.992
The British are throwing flying sharks at us!

27:35.072 --> 27:38.015
And they're gonna succeed next time,
too, unless you listen to us.

27:38.095 --> 27:40.845
We can help you beat the British
and the sharks, too.

27:40.925 --> 27:44.341
Don't just stand there. Go in. Go in.

27:46.395 --> 27:48.308
Give me that.

27:48.388 --> 27:52.475
This is a weapon from the future.
It's got technology you wouldn't understand.

27:56.461 --> 27:58.665
General Washington.

28:02.007 --> 28:05.210
I've been told the British
have an army of sharks...

28:05.290 --> 28:07.731
...and you have a plan to stop them.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.697
It's called a Sharknado,
and, no, the British don't control it.

28:10.777 --> 28:13.606
If I remember my history correctly...
and I'm a history teacher...

28:13.686 --> 28:15.701
...which makes me uniquely qualified...

28:15.781 --> 28:19.498
...you got a bunch of cannons lined up
out here from Fort Ticonderoga.

28:19.578 --> 28:23.453
We can use those cannons to destroy
the Sharknado and kill the sharks.

28:23.533 --> 28:26.360
- The Captain, sir.
- Come on in.

28:28.088 --> 28:29.793
- Washington.
- Hamilton.

28:29.873 --> 28:31.412
Washington.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.701
Hamilton.

28:33.781 --> 28:36.413
- Washington.
- Hamilton?

28:36.493 --> 28:39.844
You know, I'm still trying to get tickets
to your musical. Really hard to get.

28:39.924 --> 28:41.797
Wait. Who the hell is this?

28:41.877 --> 28:46.302
You already have your artillery in place.
Let us show you where to position 'em.

28:46.382 --> 28:49.207
I don't want to tell you this, but, uh...

28:49.287 --> 28:52.097
- ...we're from the future.
- We really have no time.

28:52.177 --> 28:56.702
Take them away, and politely,
but firmly shoot them.

28:56.782 --> 29:00.451
All right, how 'bout this?
You, General Washington...

29:01.473 --> 29:04.119
...are on the $1.00 bill. See?

29:05.688 --> 29:08.494
- Lucky you.
- My...

29:08.574 --> 29:10.664
Hamilton, you got one, too?

29:11.144 --> 29:12.535
I doubt it.

29:12.615 --> 29:15.214
Look, the more we stand here
and argue about it...

29:15.294 --> 29:19.270
...the more time the Sharknado has to destroy
your harbor and conquer your troops...

29:19.376 --> 29:21.929
- ...and then we all lose the war.
- General Washington...

29:22.009 --> 29:26.701
...a fact about your past, in 1743, your father
died when you were just 11 years old...

29:26.781 --> 29:30.010
...and then a little bit later, you went
to Barbados and contracted smallpox.

29:30.090 --> 29:33.705
But, Mr. Hamilton, you were an orphan,
but about 240 years from now...

29:33.785 --> 29:36.360
...you become a really
great singer. Good job.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.053
How do you know all this?

29:39.884 --> 29:42.791
Because I'm a history teacher, damn it...

29:42.871 --> 29:46.731
- ...and you are my history.
- What's it gonna be?

29:46.811 --> 29:50.805
Hamilton, I think we need to give our
new allies all the cannons they need.

29:50.885 --> 29:54.061
We have a Sharknado to defeat.

29:56.472 --> 29:58.560
Shoot at the tornado!

30:00.085 --> 30:03.105
- Hey! Hey, let me help you!
- Go away.

30:03.185 --> 30:05.560
I'm not taking no for an answer.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.109
- Take this.
- Okay.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.154
Fire!

30:15.594 --> 30:17.165
Yes!

30:18.877 --> 30:22.297
Okay. I know it's gonna probably
make me sound crazy and all, but...

30:22.377 --> 30:25.204
No, I know you're crazy,
but I still like you.

30:25.284 --> 30:26.800
Okay.

30:27.380 --> 30:29.269
Yeah, okay.

30:32.988 --> 30:34.390
Here you go, sir!

30:34.470 --> 30:37.501
All right, listen up!
We gotta fire the cannons all at once.

30:37.581 --> 30:40.406
We gotta time 'em with
a lightning strike. If we do that...

30:40.486 --> 30:43.807
...all the cannonballs will become
electrified and will go into the Sharknado...

30:43.887 --> 30:45.729
...and it'll blow up all the sharks.

30:50.698 --> 30:55.549
Look, I've faced down more of these
Sharknados than I care to remember.

30:55.629 --> 30:58.285
There's no time to stop and think
about the madness of it all.

30:58.365 --> 31:01.808
You just have to do it.
We're not fighting for just our country.

31:01.888 --> 31:04.196
We're fighting for all of humanity.

31:04.276 --> 31:06.198
Now who's with me?

31:11.474 --> 31:13.575
Just load the cannons!

31:13.655 --> 31:17.133
Ready the cannons! Aim!

31:17.213 --> 31:18.792
Fire!

31:23.419 --> 31:26.048
It's a full count, bottom of the ninth.

31:37.297 --> 31:39.297
All right, locked and loaded!

31:39.377 --> 31:42.803
3, 2, 1...

31:42.883 --> 31:44.049
...fire!

31:53.880 --> 31:56.348
Retreat! Retreat!

32:10.678 --> 32:12.919
God bless America.

32:16.538 --> 32:19.609
The British are retreating.

32:19.689 --> 32:23.913
- Suck it, you redcoat ninnies!
- Where's Nova?

32:23.993 --> 32:27.014
She was walking into town
with Private Clarke.

32:28.497 --> 32:31.125
You two figure out how to get us some speed.

32:31.205 --> 32:33.024
I'll be right back.

32:33.384 --> 32:37.713
Here you go. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

32:37.793 --> 32:40.606
- Take care of it.
- That was weird.

32:41.186 --> 32:43.292
Hold up. I'll take this from here.

32:45.795 --> 32:47.667
Great job today.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.859
Let me buy you a drink, Private Shepard.

32:56.784 --> 32:59.129
- I have a ride for you.
- Whoa!

32:59.209 --> 33:02.025
It's not safe for these horses
to come through the portal.

33:02.105 --> 33:05.987
But I have something
much more powerful in mind.

33:07.891 --> 33:10.709
Any chance this is a letter
to your grandfather?

33:10.789 --> 33:13.010
Yeah, as a matter of fact, there is.

33:13.590 --> 33:16.481
- Do you want to read it, Fin?
- Yeah.

33:21.002 --> 33:23.404
You're warning him not to go fishing.

33:23.484 --> 33:27.345
If he doesn't go to the sea, there's no way
that shark will kill him. He'll stay alive.

33:27.425 --> 33:29.105
And you stop fighting sharks...

33:29.185 --> 33:33.010
...you don't start the Sharknado Sisterhood,
and you don't save me or my family.

33:33.090 --> 33:37.441
You know what, Fin? It's time I save
my own family, okay? And, by the way...

33:37.521 --> 33:40.198
...he might not even get this note. He's
not gonna be born for two more centuries...

33:40.278 --> 33:42.279
...but I had to try.

33:43.695 --> 33:45.942
No. We can't mess with destiny.

33:46.022 --> 33:48.124
Mess with destiny?

33:48.204 --> 33:51.908
We just fought in the American Revolution.
It looks like we're messing with destiny to me.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.628
No, we stopped history from changing
by stopping a Sharknado...

33:54.708 --> 33:56.725
...so things could stay the way they are.

33:56.805 --> 33:59.436
Your grandfather didn't die in a Sharknado.

34:01.924 --> 34:06.507
- We can't change his fate.
- Next time we jump, I might not exist.

34:06.587 --> 34:10.922
And what are the odds that I ran into my
ancestor? I'll never get this chance again.

34:11.002 --> 34:13.606
My grandfather raised me...

34:13.686 --> 34:16.501
...and I was never the same after he died,
so I would give anything...

34:16.581 --> 34:18.437
...to have one more day with him.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.974
I'm sorry, Nova. We can't.

34:26.909 --> 34:30.024
- I'm sorry.
- You know what, Fin?

34:30.103 --> 34:34.580
I'm sorry. You can't control me,
and you won't control my destiny.

34:45.382 --> 34:50.228
I just know that the energy bolt is more
powerful than anything else we have...

34:50.309 --> 34:54.154
- ...but I just cannot grab it.
- I know what the problem is.

34:54.234 --> 34:56.071
What we're missing...

34:56.695 --> 34:58.564
...is the key.

35:03.164 --> 35:05.057
Look what Ben gave us, his carriage.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.984
Listen up, you little wig-biters.
Come along. Get you inside.

35:09.064 --> 35:12.209
In you go. In you go. Hello.

35:12.289 --> 35:15.458
- It's been an honor to meet you.
- This day will go down in history.

35:15.538 --> 35:17.305
No doubt.

35:17.385 --> 35:19.004
Bryan, let's go.

35:19.684 --> 35:23.520
- I'm sorry, Fin. I can't.
- What are you talking about?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.902
You see, this is why
Gil picked you to lead the team.

35:25.982 --> 35:29.828
You're always ready to run in there
and go fight the next Sharknado...

35:29.908 --> 35:32.758
...but me, I run, and I just get tired.

35:32.838 --> 35:35.685
Fin, last time I jumped, I wasn't exactly me.

35:35.765 --> 35:38.943
- I can't take that chance anymore.
- Bryan, you can't stay here.

35:39.023 --> 35:41.305
I taught history for 25 years.

35:41.385 --> 35:44.283
Now I'm ready to live it.

35:51.909 --> 35:53.758
Be safe.

35:56.160 --> 36:01.109
I thought you might need a little extra
power to get back to the future!

36:02.085 --> 36:03.522
What?

36:03.602 --> 36:06.094
Well, first we need
to get this kite in the air.

36:10.321 --> 36:13.829
- Get us out of here!
- To infinity and beyond!

36:25.052 --> 36:26.926
Awesome, dude!

36:27.006 --> 36:30.001
Do you think history will remember this day?

36:30.081 --> 36:34.199
Do you think they'll remember me
for anything other than this stupid kite?

36:34.279 --> 36:36.902
No, it's pretty much just the kite.

36:36.982 --> 36:39.316
- Oh. Toodles.
- Okay, take care, Ben.

36:39.396 --> 36:41.918
Is there any, uh, place to get a...

36:41.998 --> 36:44.377
...taco around here or anything, or...

37:02.060 --> 37:04.272
We don't have to do this, son.

37:04.701 --> 37:07.559
You could still surrender and live.

37:10.387 --> 37:13.652
Billy the Kid does not surrender!

37:46.064 --> 37:48.563
This ain't over yet, my friend!

37:49.135 --> 37:52.025
Friend? Who you calling "friend"?

37:52.105 --> 37:53.734
Get your hands up, partner.

37:55.978 --> 37:58.653
They'll arrest all of us if we get caught,
okay? We have to stay quiet.

37:58.733 --> 38:02.893
- Get along, losers! We're going shopping!
- I'll take that.

38:02.973 --> 38:04.813
Turn around.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.468
Don't just stand there
like a bunch of Kansas City showgirls!

38:09.548 --> 38:11.354
Go get him!

38:12.534 --> 38:14.354
I don't know how you and Billy the Kid...

38:14.434 --> 38:17.644
...pulled off that carriage
falling out of the sky stunt...

38:17.724 --> 38:20.068
...but this sideshow ends today.

38:20.148 --> 38:21.978
Billy the Kid?

38:22.358 --> 38:25.580
- I'm not with Billy the Kid.
- You had his gun.

38:25.660 --> 38:28.510
You helped him get away. I say you're lying.

38:28.590 --> 38:31.773
- You're under arrest.
- You got it all twisted.

38:31.853 --> 38:34.200
Yeah, I think I know who's twisted, mister.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.788
No one messes with Sheriff Ron!

38:36.868 --> 38:38.079
He'll be okay.

38:38.159 --> 38:40.013
Keep walking.

38:48.646 --> 38:51.716
- Get up slowly.
- Skye?

38:52.056 --> 38:53.734
April?

39:04.247 --> 39:07.387
Tried that already. No use.

39:07.467 --> 39:09.368
Are you with Billy the Kid?

39:09.448 --> 39:11.402
He's my ride out of here.

39:11.862 --> 39:14.938
Well, if he comes to break you out,
take me with you.

39:15.018 --> 39:16.878
Safer in here.

39:17.758 --> 39:19.634
Weather's changing.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.533
You don't know the half of it.

39:25.256 --> 39:27.120
What are you in for, mister?

39:27.200 --> 39:29.484
Just trying to put my family back together.

39:29.564 --> 39:31.486
Story of my life.

39:31.566 --> 39:33.773
I hope you're ready to rock, boy.

39:34.453 --> 39:36.288
All right, blondie.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.541
Time to go.

39:41.044 --> 39:43.639
Wait. Where's Billy?

39:43.719 --> 39:46.965
Oh, he ran like the coward he is. Come on.

39:47.956 --> 39:49.587
Hey, where are you taking him?

39:49.667 --> 39:53.727
It's judgment day.
This boy's gonna meet his maker.

39:55.173 --> 39:59.074
- Good luck finding your family!
- Oh, are those your last words?

39:59.753 --> 40:02.579
No. Semper paratus.

40:02.659 --> 40:04.546
Shut up.

40:05.342 --> 40:08.865
Gil, it's Dad! Gil, it's Dad!

40:08.945 --> 40:11.489
Howdy, Deputy.
I do declare I'm new around here...

40:11.569 --> 40:13.888
...but I think I found this man.

40:13.968 --> 40:16.894
He looked real suspicious,
and I think he had a gun.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.490
- Hey, Fin!
- Skye.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.235
Need a lift?

40:32.150 --> 40:34.428
Here. Put these on.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.073
Surprised to see me?

40:38.153 --> 40:40.993
Not really, not after what I've been through.

40:41.073 --> 40:44.350
- You know I always got your back.
- Well, you did kinda die in New York.

40:44.430 --> 40:46.822
Well, I was in New York, but I didn't die.

40:49.153 --> 40:50.835
- You did kinda die.
- Uh-uh.

40:50.915 --> 40:54.336
I ran into this guy wearing
a freaking shark helmet. Bam!

40:54.416 --> 40:58.890
- He put me back here to save your butt.
- That was my son Gil, and he's here.

40:59.660 --> 41:01.599
- There he is.
- Dead man walking.

41:01.679 --> 41:03.567
Not for long.

41:03.647 --> 41:06.572
- I screwed up.
- How?

41:06.652 --> 41:10.221
Billy the Kid was supposed
to rescue Gil, but he can't.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.921
When we landed in town,
we changed that, and he left.

41:14.946 --> 41:16.771
Gil's gonna hang.

41:17.251 --> 41:18.966
Let me go, Fin.

41:19.046 --> 41:21.480
I'll rescue him like he rescued me.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.057
No, you can't. If he
recognizes us, he won't rescue us.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.861
- He knows you.
- The future Gil knows me.

41:29.441 --> 41:31.339
Trust me.

41:31.750 --> 41:35.041
If you're looking for someone
to save you, son, stop.

41:36.352 --> 41:37.897
That's Gil.

41:37.977 --> 41:40.258
Bad weather's coming.

41:42.958 --> 41:45.261
I'd take cover if I were you.

41:45.341 --> 41:47.135
Bag him.

41:50.148 --> 41:52.980
Citizens of Santa Mira Ridge...

41:53.060 --> 41:57.072
...once again, I hand out justice
to those who break the law in my town.

41:57.152 --> 42:01.087
We must uphold our laws,
instill order, not chaos.

42:01.167 --> 42:05.432
Let this man's punishment
be the exception, not the rule.

42:06.698 --> 42:08.689
This is our life.

42:08.769 --> 42:10.773
This is our town.

42:12.552 --> 42:14.377
Looks like we have more problems.

42:19.149 --> 42:21.278
Storm's a-coming!

42:23.552 --> 42:25.887
- Hang him.
- Yippee-ki-yay.

42:40.359 --> 42:42.639
What the hell's going on in my town?

42:42.719 --> 42:45.134
And who cut that boy loose?

42:48.460 --> 42:51.528
Get up. Come on. Get up.
I got you. I got you.

42:52.968 --> 42:54.964
Who are you? Did Billy send you?

42:55.044 --> 42:59.097
No. Don't worry about Billy.
Worry about that Sharknado.

42:59.654 --> 43:01.918
You know about Sharknados?

43:01.998 --> 43:05.565
I also know everything there is
to know about you, Little Gil.

43:06.295 --> 43:09.319
You parents are waiting for you
on the other side of that storm.

43:09.399 --> 43:11.972
Now you go save me so I can save you...

43:12.052 --> 43:15.809
...so you can save your parents,
and we can save the world, okay?

43:15.889 --> 43:19.180
- Who are you?
- I'm Skye...

43:19.260 --> 43:22.258
...a chocolate blast from the past.

43:22.338 --> 43:25.145
Now go, kid! Go! Go!

43:29.845 --> 43:33.668
Go ahead. Shark my day.

43:37.350 --> 43:40.815
Deputy Richie! Deputy Richie! What happened?

43:44.399 --> 43:46.234
Son of a bitch.

44:01.866 --> 44:04.660
Hey! You're supposed to be in jail!

44:04.740 --> 44:07.049
You're shooting at my son.

44:08.946 --> 44:11.177
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

44:11.257 --> 44:14.284
I'm not gonna take this anymore.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.663
One shark!

44:20.743 --> 44:23.432
Two shark! Red shark!

44:24.052 --> 44:26.701
Blue shark! Yee-haw!

44:27.241 --> 44:30.232
Gil! Gil!

44:31.863 --> 44:34.557
- The train is leaving!
- Why are there fish falling from the sky?

44:34.637 --> 44:36.780
Don't worry about that.
Just get to the train!

44:38.918 --> 44:40.485
Oh, my God.

44:43.070 --> 44:46.216
- Where's that sound coming from?
- What is that? Your bag.

44:46.296 --> 44:50.325
I can help. Point me toward
the storm. Activating lasers.

44:56.451 --> 44:58.778
I didn't know I could do that.

44:59.543 --> 45:02.474
I think your head is fueled
by a nuclear core.

45:02.554 --> 45:05.278
- Where are the girls?
- They're coming.

45:05.358 --> 45:07.586
- The Sharknado's dying.
- That's a good thing, right?

45:07.666 --> 45:10.963
- Great, but we need speed to time jump.
- What happens if we miss it?

45:11.043 --> 45:12.412
- Then we're stuck here forever.
- What?

45:12.492 --> 45:14.707
Come on. We'll figure it out.

45:14.863 --> 45:18.032
- Going somewhere, slick?
- I don't have time for this.

45:18.112 --> 45:19.787
Time?

45:19.867 --> 45:23.256
You know, it's a funny thing you
mentioning time, 'cause apparently...

45:23.336 --> 45:26.463
- ...I have all the time in the world.
- What are you talking about?

45:26.543 --> 45:29.217
Don't you look at me funny. I ain't stupid.

45:29.297 --> 45:32.965
That cowboy was from the future,
and he promised me if I rescue him...

45:33.045 --> 45:37.175
- ...he was gonna take me with him.
- You can't go into the future, Billy.

45:37.255 --> 45:40.607
You think you're gonna go
to the future instead of me? Me!

45:40.687 --> 45:42.564
Billy the Kid!

45:43.244 --> 45:45.371
I already been there and done it.

45:49.637 --> 45:51.787
What if I take your place?

45:51.867 --> 45:54.146
The future is ripe for robbing.

45:58.514 --> 46:01.065
She did it. Now let's go find Fin and Skye.

46:01.145 --> 46:02.165
Let's go!

46:02.245 --> 46:04.475
The vortex is collapsing.

46:04.555 --> 46:08.175
- Get out of the way!
- Prepare to draw.

46:08.255 --> 46:11.089
Really? We're doing this?

46:11.719 --> 46:12.998
Mm-hmm.

46:14.662 --> 46:16.260
Draw!

46:24.143 --> 46:26.180
I ain't dead yet!

46:27.660 --> 46:29.523
You're dead now.

46:31.248 --> 46:33.163
Kind of gross. Hey.

46:33.243 --> 46:37.720
All right, that train's our only chance.
We gotta get in it. Come on. Let's go.

46:54.141 --> 46:55.678
Come on!

46:57.441 --> 46:58.984
Reach.

47:17.992 --> 47:21.485
- Hurry. This train isn't fast enough.
- I'm gonna unhook some cars.

47:21.565 --> 47:24.785
- You can do that?
- Yeah. Runs in the family.

47:24.865 --> 47:26.237
You're the conductors now.

47:26.317 --> 47:28.934
- You got it.
- Careful.

47:52.862 --> 47:55.319
He better hurry up. We're getting close.

48:14.563 --> 48:16.411
Whoo! Surf's up!

48:31.678 --> 48:35.234
<i>How do you do, everyone?
This is Rand McDonald, reporting live...</i>

48:35.314 --> 48:38.072
<i>...from the beaches
of Santa Monica, California...</i>

48:38.152 --> 48:41.077
<i>...where people are literally
doing the shark...</i>

48:41.157 --> 48:44.560
<i>...a dance craze
that's number one with a bullet...</i>

48:44.640 --> 48:46.564
<i>...a bullet to the head.</i>

48:56.255 --> 48:57.485
Well, that sucked.

49:13.976 --> 49:14.927
Fin!

49:26.450 --> 49:29.281
We gotta go warn those people. Come on.

49:33.562 --> 49:36.033
Thank you. We're Quint.

49:42.944 --> 49:44.316
Tornado!

49:45.969 --> 49:47.731
Shark!

49:48.865 --> 49:51.466
Sharknado! Run!

50:18.957 --> 50:20.440
Surf's up.

50:24.091 --> 50:27.904
You okay? Skye, you got him?
Get him some help. Come on. Come on.

50:30.562 --> 50:32.143
Hurry!

50:37.096 --> 50:40.159
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
A shark! The shark's coming!</i>

50:40.239 --> 50:43.708
<i>Hey! Hey! You're Rand McDonald from TV!</i>

50:43.788 --> 50:46.528
<i>You're Rand McDonald! I'm on... I'm on TV!</i>

50:46.608 --> 50:48.238
<i>Baba booey!</i>

50:52.420 --> 50:54.278
<i>It's a...</i>

50:54.983 --> 50:59.243
<i>...Shark-'n'-rollnado...</i>

50:59.874 --> 51:01.567
Mommy!

51:03.553 --> 51:05.359
Let's go.

51:06.639 --> 51:09.717
- Keep it up, Gilly!
- You got it, Raye!

51:10.797 --> 51:12.868
You know what that means.

51:14.545 --> 51:16.434
They're my parents.

51:19.254 --> 51:20.479
Hey!

51:20.559 --> 51:23.686
Get out of our way, big feet,
or we'll fry you.

51:31.043 --> 51:33.310
The professor made it.

51:34.044 --> 51:36.759
Why are you trying to destroy that Sharknado?

51:36.839 --> 51:39.176
Sharknado? How do you know that name?

51:39.256 --> 51:41.792
- Do you know a guy named Gil?
- The professor?

51:41.872 --> 51:44.668
- Blond hair, blue eyes, shark fin helmet?
- Wait. Do you know him?

51:44.748 --> 51:47.170
- Yeah. He's our son.
- You mean more like your father, right?

51:47.250 --> 51:50.129
- He must have got older.
- How do you two dweebs know so much?

51:50.209 --> 51:52.951
He's trying to get
in the vortex to time travel.

51:53.031 --> 51:54.828
Oh, dear.

51:57.385 --> 51:59.479
Fin, look.

52:00.009 --> 52:03.073
- I think this is the prototype of the...
- The capacitor.

52:05.776 --> 52:07.175
- Look at the date.
- Isn't that the date...

52:07.255 --> 52:09.036
...from when the first Sharknado
hit Santa Monica?

52:09.116 --> 52:11.331
Yeah. That's where we're going to next.

52:16.042 --> 52:19.266
Now listen. We gotta stop all this
jibber-jabbering and 86 that Sharknado...

52:19.346 --> 52:22.762
- ...before we all become fish food.
- Let's get the big gun.

52:22.842 --> 52:26.255
Let's do it. Hope JPL doesn't
find out I borrowed this.

52:26.745 --> 52:29.021
I need your help to stabilize it.

52:35.134 --> 52:37.667
All right, everybody hold on.

52:37.747 --> 52:40.400
The professor told us to destroy it
after he got through.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.784
Now!

52:52.732 --> 52:55.976
- It's gone!
- We did it! We did it!

52:56.856 --> 52:59.077
- We did it!
- It's gone.

52:59.477 --> 53:02.058
I've got it. We can still make the jump.

53:02.138 --> 53:05.181
- Jump? What jump?
- This prototype isn't as advanced...

53:05.261 --> 53:08.224
...but I can program the date, but we
can make this work. I can make it work.

53:08.304 --> 53:12.068
- I just need... I need speed.
- What about that sweet ride you just got?

53:12.148 --> 53:14.593
Oh, she's a beaut, huh.
A brand-new Cadillac El Dorado.

53:14.673 --> 53:17.572
- Great! We'll take it! Yes.
- I'm taking the capacitor.

53:17.652 --> 53:20.033
- I'm gonna make some adjustments.
- Wait.

53:21.454 --> 53:23.457
You look so familiar.

53:24.237 --> 53:26.467
Did we go to high school together?

53:26.547 --> 53:28.676
I would have remembered that.

53:30.453 --> 53:32.151
I'm Raye Martin.

53:33.349 --> 53:36.191
- Fin.
- Hi, Fin.

53:36.751 --> 53:40.030
And I'm Gilly, Gilly Shepard.
Nice to meet you.

53:40.959 --> 53:42.631
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy...

53:42.711 --> 53:45.037
...but the professor used that capacitor
to move into the future...

53:45.117 --> 53:47.758
...but there's not gonna be
any future unless we meet him there.

53:47.838 --> 53:50.055
You're from the future?

53:50.135 --> 53:53.265
Okay, future boy, tell us
something that hasn't happened yet.

53:53.345 --> 53:54.852
Yeah.

53:54.932 --> 53:56.801
You two fall in love.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.819
What?

54:00.935 --> 54:02.458
Dork.

54:07.133 --> 54:09.509
- Here you go, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

54:11.030 --> 54:12.629
Daddio.

54:13.744 --> 54:16.772
Oh, wait. Button up. It's getting cold.

54:17.752 --> 54:19.608
Good luck!

54:34.178 --> 54:38.465
If we ever have kids one day, I just...
I hope they don't turn out like that.

54:38.745 --> 54:41.333
- That would be weird, yeah.
- Whoo!

54:43.951 --> 54:45.294
You got the capacitor set?

54:45.374 --> 54:47.438
Yep, back to Santa Monica,
just like Gil said.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.927
Santa Monica, here we come.

55:27.041 --> 55:29.181
I have an extra ticket
to the Spice Girls concert.

55:29.261 --> 55:31.640
Do you want to go, or are you gonna
go see "Titanic" for the tenth time?

55:31.720 --> 55:33.861
Nova, what did you do?

55:34.930 --> 55:38.242
- Why are we in San Francisco?
- This doesn't concern you, Fin.

55:38.322 --> 55:41.191
Doesn't concern me?
What do you think you're doing?

55:41.271 --> 55:45.460
What I'm doing? We've been
interfering with everything.

55:45.540 --> 55:47.371
And who do you think you are, anyway?

55:47.451 --> 55:50.692
You wouldn't let me send a note to my
grandfather, yet you didn't think twice...

55:50.772 --> 55:54.055
...about when Bryan stayed behind
during the Revolutionary War, did you?

55:54.135 --> 55:58.445
And what about hanging out with your parents?
Just leave me alone, okay?

55:58.525 --> 56:01.549
This is my story now.
You saved your family...

56:01.629 --> 56:03.778
- ...and now I'm saving mine.
- Nova...

56:03.858 --> 56:06.537
There's nothing you can do to stop me, okay?

56:10.833 --> 56:14.364
- What's that girl up to?
- She brought us back to 1997...

56:14.444 --> 56:17.768
...so she could prevent her grandfather
from being killed by a shark.

56:28.331 --> 56:31.633
- I want to catch a big fish today.
- And you will.

56:31.713 --> 56:33.449
I brought my lucky lure.

56:33.529 --> 56:35.707
Well, then it's gonna be
your lucky day, Nova.

56:35.787 --> 56:38.799
Quit calling me that, Grandpa.
My name is Jenny Lynn.

56:38.879 --> 56:41.655
- You shine way too bright for that name.
- Like a star?

56:41.735 --> 56:44.384
Exactly, like a little nova.

56:51.003 --> 56:54.520
- Wow. You look cool.
- Not as cool as you look.

56:54.600 --> 56:57.654
- I'm Jenny Lynn.
- That's a pretty name.

56:57.734 --> 57:00.824
- But you can call me Nova.
- Oh.

57:02.208 --> 57:05.671
- Hey, do you have room for one more?
- That'll be 20 bucks.

57:06.668 --> 57:10.050
Ah, forget about it. I...
my charter boat. I'll cover you.

57:10.130 --> 57:12.490
- Just catch a big fish.
- Thank you.

57:12.570 --> 57:14.590
Hope she does the right thing.

57:17.058 --> 57:20.672
- Hey, you got room for three more?
- That'll be 60 bucks. You got any poles?

57:20.752 --> 57:22.610
Got it right here.

57:24.853 --> 57:28.923
Okay, guys, we shove off in five minutes.

57:36.353 --> 57:39.624
Darn. I lost another one,
and I didn't even feel the fish bite.

57:39.704 --> 57:41.696
Use this one, Grandpa.

57:41.776 --> 57:43.375
Okay.

57:43.955 --> 57:46.890
All right, now, when you get a fish
on your line and you feel it...

57:46.970 --> 57:50.417
- ...you gotta keep your line taut, okay?
- Okay, Grandpa.

57:50.497 --> 57:52.733
Okay, Grandpa.

58:12.932 --> 58:16.135
Have you really thought out
what you're about to do?

58:17.250 --> 58:20.271
I have the chance to give
that little girl a real future.

58:20.351 --> 58:22.276
Any minute now, this ship will crash...

58:22.356 --> 58:25.374
...leaving my grandfather
and everyone else onboard as food...

58:25.454 --> 58:27.962
...for a school of bloodthirsty sharks.

58:28.042 --> 58:30.714
Don't tell me that if this wasn't April,
Claudia, Matt, or Gil...

58:30.794 --> 58:33.876
...that you wouldn't insist
that I help you save them.

58:33.956 --> 58:36.857
I don't think you realize
what we all have at stake here.

58:36.937 --> 58:39.972
I've had to watch my son
grow up in time without me.

58:41.352 --> 58:43.201
Do you know what that's like?

58:44.731 --> 58:48.776
Do you know how many times I thought
about just... not going forward...

58:49.656 --> 58:52.016
...staying back like Bryan did?

58:52.846 --> 58:54.656
If we're successful...

58:55.498 --> 58:57.337
...everything resets...

58:58.497 --> 59:01.558
...Gil disappears...

59:03.241 --> 59:07.395
...disappears from my heart and from
my mind because he's never existed.

59:09.242 --> 59:12.161
Nova, you said it yourself.

59:12.241 --> 59:13.674
It's bigger than us.

59:13.754 --> 59:15.633
That's not fair.

59:17.654 --> 59:19.534
That little girl...

59:20.157 --> 59:22.758
...I need my Grandpa, Fin.

59:23.138 --> 59:25.024
I know.

59:26.147 --> 59:30.479
Okay, everybody. Let's get out there
and get some big ones.

59:45.559 --> 59:47.950
I see you're admiring a family heirloom.

59:48.030 --> 59:51.674
That's been handed down generation
to generation since the Civil War.

59:51.754 --> 59:54.055
Revolutionary War.

59:54.135 --> 59:56.368
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

59:56.448 --> 01:00:00.170
You know, it's a bit of a superstition, but
I've kept it onboard as a good luck charm.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:02.580
It's where my granddaughter gets her name.

01:00:05.434 --> 01:00:08.644
What are we doing standing around?
Come on! We want to fish, right?

01:00:08.724 --> 01:00:12.528
Let's get some lines in the water!
There's some big ones out there.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:19.438
Nova, everything you are, everything
you fight for is driven by this moment.

01:00:19.518 --> 01:00:22.707
And if this moment doesn't happen,
if your grandpa doesn't die...

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:24.668
...everything could change.

01:00:24.748 --> 01:00:26.902
Okay. Okay.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.514
You know what?

01:00:30.244 --> 01:00:33.326
You're right. I get it now. I understand.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.820
Stop this boat! You have to turn this
boat around. Please. It's an emergency.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.564
- I need you to get out of here.
- Look, at some point today...

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.971
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm so sorry about this.

01:00:50.051 --> 01:00:53.017
- ...sink and then the sharks are...
- I'm really just a retired doctor.

01:00:53.097 --> 01:00:56.445
- I really shouldn't be piloting this thing.
- Can you alert a Coast Guard?

01:00:59.231 --> 01:01:00.746
- A shark.
- Shark!

01:01:00.826 --> 01:01:02.383
- Come on, Nova.
- Hey, what's that?

01:01:02.463 --> 01:01:04.694
- What? Where?
- Sharks in the water!

01:01:09.145 --> 01:01:10.724
Nova!

01:01:16.852 --> 01:01:19.917
Abandon ship!

01:01:24.145 --> 01:01:26.375
I caused this? I'm the reason
my grandfather died?

01:01:26.455 --> 01:01:29.396
Come on! I'm not gonna let
your grandfather die this time!

01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:33.906
Go! Go! Take her in the raft!
Hurry up! My friend will save you!

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:44.412
Okay, get her in the raft.

01:01:49.454 --> 01:01:50.764
My name is Nova Clarke.

01:01:50.844 --> 01:01:54.057
You killed my grandfather. Prepare to die!

01:01:55.037 --> 01:01:57.677
Hold on, Nova. You're gonna be
all right. Help is on the way.

01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:00.792
- Keep Nova safe.
- Hey, you guys coming?

01:02:00.872 --> 01:02:02.713
We'll catch up.

01:02:14.453 --> 01:02:16.178
Nova!

01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:21.160
Grab my hand! Come on!

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.726
April!

01:02:27.085 --> 01:02:29.484
- Come on, Nova!
- Help!

01:02:32.838 --> 01:02:33.940
No!

01:02:38.932 --> 01:02:40.515
Help!

01:02:55.332 --> 01:02:56.841
No!

01:02:59.295 --> 01:03:02.623
Every time I try and fix something,
it just makes things worse...

01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:05.104
...and people die again.

01:03:08.072 --> 01:03:11.483
- I can't control the future.
- You're right.

01:03:12.263 --> 01:03:16.710
You can never control the future.
All you can do is control your choices.

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.554
And now we need to do the right thing
and finish what we started.

01:03:21.774 --> 01:03:24.839
- Where's the capacitor?
- It's right here.

01:03:27.093 --> 01:03:29.479
- We have a problem.
- Is it broken?

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:32.450
It keeps adding too many numbers.
I gotta redirect the router.

01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:39.563
- We don't have time for this.
- Even if I can set it to the right time...

01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:42.199
...we still don't have enough velocity
to engage the time jump.

01:03:42.279 --> 01:03:44.382
You get that thing fixed.
I'll get us the speed we need.

01:03:44.462 --> 01:03:46.341
Working on it.

01:03:53.074 --> 01:03:56.285
- Skye?
- Almost got it. Almost got it.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:00.946
- Skye, we don't got time for this.
- Got it!

01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:04.235
- Got it!
- Grab on! Grab on!

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:37.981
Skye.

01:04:38.573 --> 01:04:40.162
Come on.

01:04:40.865 --> 01:04:42.305
Oh.

01:04:43.358 --> 01:04:45.308
Something's not right.

01:04:45.388 --> 01:04:47.275
This is not Santa Monica.

01:04:48.558 --> 01:04:51.245
Come on. Let's figure out what we did wrong.

01:05:00.654 --> 01:05:03.417
- Damn, it's quiet.
- It's too quiet.

01:05:10.174 --> 01:05:11.994
Hey, Skye...

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:15.420
- Something's not right.
- Check the date.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:21.697
- Are we there?
- Let's just say we overshot it by...

01:05:21.777 --> 01:05:23.557
...a few thousand years.

01:05:25.767 --> 01:05:28.072
20013?

01:05:28.152 --> 01:05:30.814
- I'll reset it so we can go back.
- No, we can't do that.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:33.515
Why not? We're time travelers.
We can do whatever we want.

01:05:33.595 --> 01:05:36.998
No, that's why Gil's not here
with us a second time around.

01:05:37.078 --> 01:05:39.195
That thing only offers a one-way ride.

01:05:54.203 --> 01:05:55.282
What the hell was that?

01:05:55.362 --> 01:05:58.598
Maybe that's how sharks evolved
over the last 20,000 years.

01:05:59.678 --> 01:06:02.749
I can't wait to see
what the humans look like.

01:06:17.355 --> 01:06:19.184
Well, I'll be damned.

01:06:20.064 --> 01:06:21.572
Aprils.

01:06:21.966 --> 01:06:24.047
It's planet of the Aprils.

01:06:29.006 --> 01:06:30.872
We love you, Fin.

01:06:31.461 --> 01:06:33.072
We love you, Fin.

01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:34.857
Cute outfits.

01:06:39.831 --> 01:06:42.033
I wonder what Deadpool movie we're on.

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:47.284
Where are you taking us?

01:06:47.724 --> 01:06:49.546
Answer me.

01:07:03.224 --> 01:07:04.743
Clear.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:09.502
So this is what happens
when you don't save your wife.

01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:16.700
- Looks like a shrine to my past.
- But what's it doing here?

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:19.381
Wait here. The Queen is coming.

01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:22.350
- Hail to the Queen!
- Hail to the Queen!

01:07:50.719 --> 01:07:53.905
- Don't be afraid.
- What do you want from us?

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:00.951
You.

01:08:03.254 --> 01:08:05.948
You're not April, not even human.

01:08:07.074 --> 01:08:08.618
Human?

01:08:09.353 --> 01:08:11.822
Why would I want to be human?

01:08:13.074 --> 01:08:14.967
You mean like...

01:08:15.277 --> 01:08:16.856
...her?

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.341
April.

01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:32.984
What has she done to you, April?

01:08:33.964 --> 01:08:35.889
What are you doing, huh?

01:08:35.969 --> 01:08:39.732
Collecting all this junk
like some Sharknado hoarder?

01:08:39.812 --> 01:08:42.786
When my head fell off the boat
and sank to the bottom of the ocean...

01:08:42.866 --> 01:08:47.993
...I lay there for years, angry that nobody
came back for me, especially you, Fin.

01:08:48.073 --> 01:08:50.403
Eventually I was caught by a fisherman's net.

01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:52.741
It took 10,000 years for me to forgive you...

01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.075
...and another 10,000
to create this paradise for us.

01:08:56.154 --> 01:09:00.095
- She's alive!
- We needed her DNA to create this army.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.234
You can't clone a robot, silly.

01:09:02.314 --> 01:09:05.779
How did you go back in time?
Thought this was a one-way trip.

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:10.492
Power. You could do anything with power.
I've had centuries to perfect time travel.

01:09:10.572 --> 01:09:13.295
You think you came here by accident?
I brought you here.

01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:17.995
Listen here, you emotionally
deranged Easy-Bake Oven.

01:09:18.075 --> 01:09:21.671
I don't know what kind of crazy game you got
going on here, but let me tell you something.

01:09:21.752 --> 01:09:24.716
- It is not going to...
- No! No, no! Hey!

01:09:24.796 --> 01:09:26.828
Stop! You're hurting her!

01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:30.558
Stop. Please.

01:09:32.509 --> 01:09:34.767
Take her to the exhibition!

01:09:34.846 --> 01:09:37.290
- Why are you doing this?
- Your DNA.

01:09:38.371 --> 01:09:40.353
Every queen needs a king.

01:09:41.475 --> 01:09:43.279
It's not gonna happen.

01:09:49.745 --> 01:09:51.216
Dad!

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:55.107
- I've missed you so much, Dad.
- Matt.

01:09:55.187 --> 01:09:59.478
Mom could make this a home again.
We can be together forever.

01:09:59.558 --> 01:10:01.633
- Come on, Dad.
- Claudia.

01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:04.860
This is what it's all about.
It's about family.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.426
- Fin.
- Nova.

01:10:08.506 --> 01:10:11.736
Listen to April. We can make this work.

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:14.903
You're not real. None of you are real!

01:10:14.983 --> 01:10:18.076
- Exactly.
- We're better than human.

01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:20.422
And you can be, too.

01:10:27.404 --> 01:10:28.806
Titanium.

01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:48.311
- You want to fight me?
- I don't want to fight you!

01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:59.260
- You never stopped loving her!
- And I never will!

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:02.679
If I can't have you, then no April can!

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.961
Get away from him, you bitch.

01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:14.965
No!

01:12:24.022 --> 01:12:26.274
I do believe we have a deal.

01:12:26.354 --> 01:12:27.486
<i>Salud.</i>

01:12:42.202 --> 01:12:44.510
Azzinaro! ¿Ultima red, okay?

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:49.146
Sí, Captain Santiago. We're close.
The pod of 30,000 sharks is up ahead.

01:12:54.406 --> 01:12:58.118
Azzinaro, batten down the hatches.
Bring in all the fishing nets.

01:12:58.198 --> 01:13:00.105
A storm is coming!

01:13:02.302 --> 01:13:03.907
<i>Dios mí­o.</i>

01:13:03.987 --> 01:13:06.557
- Santiago!
- What is that?

01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:08.465
An omen?

01:13:08.997 --> 01:13:11.613
- Throw it away!
- No, don't do that!

01:13:11.693 --> 01:13:14.592
Who are you, and what are you doing here?

01:13:14.672 --> 01:13:16.838
It's a long story. We don't have time for it.

01:13:16.918 --> 01:13:21.023
- Are you with Palmer and came to kill me?
- No, I'm trying to save your life.

01:13:21.103 --> 01:13:24.112
That head is nuclear,
and she's really pissed off.

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:27.097
If you don't put it down, it's gonna
be end of the world as we know it.

01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:29.716
You bring a bomb to my boat?

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:34.542
Make it stop! Make it stop!

01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:37.775
Make it stop.

01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:44.084
You came back for me.

01:13:51.157 --> 01:13:53.022
Now take a pick.

01:13:53.102 --> 01:13:55.548
Port or starboard?

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.355
Fin, listen to me.
You must destroy this Sharknado.

01:14:08.435 --> 01:14:13.067
If it's not stopped, time will collapse.
All that we know will explode into nothing.

01:14:13.147 --> 01:14:15.026
I got it.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:21.768
Where is your friend with the head?

01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:25.343
Change of plans, Captain.
I'm gonna take the money...

01:14:25.423 --> 01:14:27.870
...your cargo, and what's left of the ship.

01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:38.063
All this is your fault for bringing
<i>el diablo</i> to my boat.

01:14:38.143 --> 01:14:41.174
Put down the gun,
or I'm gonna blow up the boat!

01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:42.328
Why?

01:14:42.408 --> 01:14:45.166
I need your help to destroy that Sharknado.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.219
- April, what's wrong?
- I need to recharge.

01:14:57.575 --> 01:15:00.155
Okay. We got a deal.

01:15:04.308 --> 01:15:07.000
- Do you know what I learned out here?
- What's that?

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.833
We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.

01:15:08.913 --> 01:15:11.712
They are the ones who should be afraid of us.

01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:20.805
- You catch fish with these?
- Sometimes.

01:16:15.656 --> 01:16:17.238
No!

01:16:18.502 --> 01:16:21.755
Fin, my lasers have recharged.
I can finish off the Last Sharknado!

01:16:21.835 --> 01:16:23.711
Right! The lasers!

01:16:28.799 --> 01:16:30.378
Dad.

01:16:32.009 --> 01:16:34.306
Gil, you're alive! Ah!

01:16:34.592 --> 01:16:37.014
Fin, the Sharknado!

01:16:39.991 --> 01:16:43.124
The time vortex dropped me off here.

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:46.518
We can finish this off. I need the capacitor.

01:16:46.598 --> 01:16:50.977
- I can fix this. We can fix this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:58.283
Semper fidelus. A Shepard is always loyal.

01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:03.213
You mean, "Semper paratus, always prepared."

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:07.015
Of course. I must have forgotten.

01:17:07.595 --> 01:17:10.667
- Who are you?
- Give it to me!

01:17:10.747 --> 01:17:12.272
No!

01:17:13.904 --> 01:17:16.614
You can't destroy this Sharknado!

01:17:16.694 --> 01:17:20.123
This is our future! This is our destiny!

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:22.677
- Come back with me!
- Never!

01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:44.879
Fin, grab the capacitor!

01:17:55.099 --> 01:17:56.531
Get it!

01:18:07.595 --> 01:18:09.397
April!

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.312
That's mine! You don't know how to use it!

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:20.984
- Give me the capacitor!
- No! Let go!

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:24.027
- Let go!
- I'm not going anywhere with you!

01:18:24.107 --> 01:18:28.322
We can live forever,
and no one we love will ever die again!

01:18:28.402 --> 01:18:32.167
- Not like this!
- Stop, or you will destroy time!

01:18:32.247 --> 01:18:33.825
I'll take that chance!

01:18:45.316 --> 01:18:47.372
It's shorting out!

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:53.217
Let go, or I won't be able to stop this!

01:18:53.697 --> 01:18:57.112
You are in big trouble in Little China!

01:18:57.692 --> 01:18:58.936
Oh! Sharks!

01:18:59.016 --> 01:19:00.918
Float like a butterfly, huh?
Sting like a bee, huh?

01:19:00.998 --> 01:19:02.558
<i>Nein!</i>

01:19:04.805 --> 01:19:07.725
- Tonight, we dine in hell!
- I must protect you!

01:19:07.805 --> 01:19:11.332
You're coming home with me
so we could live forever!

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:13.167
Never!

01:19:13.247 --> 01:19:17.485
Bring it on, little sharks!
You're gonna get rocked!

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:21.243
- Great Scott!
- Let them eat cake!

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:24.072
Lend me your sharks!

01:19:25.908 --> 01:19:28.783
Too late! I control your fate now!

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:40.985
Die, shark!

01:19:45.599 --> 01:19:49.030
Fin, it's time to go home!

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.343
Oh, crap.

01:19:56.517 --> 01:19:58.127
Fin! Move!

01:20:13.113 --> 01:20:16.160
- April?
- Fin, look out!

01:20:18.602 --> 01:20:20.487
Grab my tail!

01:20:23.204 --> 01:20:27.084
Time is collapsing,
but there's one thing left we can do.

01:20:28.695 --> 01:20:30.513
What's that?

01:20:30.593 --> 01:20:32.313
I have a fail-safe button.

01:20:32.393 --> 01:20:36.328
If you activate it in the heart of the storm,
it will self-destruct everything.

01:20:36.408 --> 01:20:39.482
It will either repair time
or destroy the universe.

01:20:44.616 --> 01:20:46.635
Ready to blow my mind?

01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:49.528
- It's time for a reboot.
- See you on the other side.

01:20:49.608 --> 01:20:52.858
- I love you, Fin Shepard.
- I love you, April.

01:21:32.413 --> 01:21:34.732
This one is on me today, George.

01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:42.620
Did a bomb just go off?

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.538
You know what? I bet they're
testing down at Point Mugu.

01:21:46.618 --> 01:21:49.196
- I'm gonna call my unit and find out.
- That's a good idea.

01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:56.035
- Poor baby.
- "Poor baby"?

01:21:56.115 --> 01:21:58.682
Yeah. I really love sharks.

01:21:59.202 --> 01:22:02.673
Hey, Mom. You and Dad ready to go?
I have the car packed.

01:22:02.753 --> 01:22:05.169
As soon as your dad says all his goodbyes.

01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:06.817
Hey, Gemini.

01:22:06.897 --> 01:22:09.569
Baby, what are you doing on your feet?
You know what the doctor said. Come on.

01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:12.384
Should you be giving us free drinks?
It's not your bar anymore.

01:22:12.464 --> 01:22:14.528
Yeah, and I'm not gonna
have anyplace to drink.

01:22:14.608 --> 01:22:19.273
Hey, Fin, thanks again for the college loan.
I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

01:22:19.797 --> 01:22:21.497
And you, too, April. Thank you, guys.

01:22:21.577 --> 01:22:24.939
Don't forget. I offered
to pay you double if you stayed.

01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:29.931
- Okay, this kid needs a name.
- I already have a name.

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:33.198
- His name is Gil.
- Baby.

01:22:33.278 --> 01:22:35.024
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:22:35.104 --> 01:22:38.805
Grandpa wanted me to give you this,
in case the baby's born while he's in space.

01:22:41.238 --> 01:22:44.714
"For the 'little one.'
May he always fly. Dad."

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.649
Hey, everybody, listen up!

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:52.683
<i>On Election Day, reach for the sky,
and vote for me.</i>

01:22:52.763 --> 01:22:55.755
We grew up with her.
She's gonna be the next president.

01:22:55.835 --> 01:22:57.664
<i>God bless America.</i>

01:22:58.464 --> 01:23:00.477
Are you really thinking
about this move to Kansas?

01:23:00.557 --> 01:23:02.933
Yeah, you're not gonna be, like,
a farmer or something, right?

01:23:03.013 --> 01:23:05.312
- I'll start some kind of business.
- Like what?

01:23:05.392 --> 01:23:07.859
Maybe a tree-trimming business.

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:10.197
I couldn't see you with a chainsaw.

01:23:11.906 --> 01:23:13.795
Lay 'em on me, bro.

01:23:14.116 --> 01:23:17.138
- Thank you.
- Don't run it into the ground.

01:23:17.218 --> 01:23:18.720
Yes, sir.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.570
All right, everybody. Last round's on me.

01:23:23.691 --> 01:23:26.377
Six years ago, when I opened up this bar...

01:23:26.457 --> 01:23:28.789
...things between me and my family...

01:23:28.869 --> 01:23:32.493
...weren't so good.
I had a lot of growing up to do.

01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:37.755
But this bar brought us back together...

01:23:39.206 --> 01:23:42.652
...and made us stronger,
brought us closer to our friends.

01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:46.022
I'm gonna miss this place...

01:23:46.102 --> 01:23:49.911
...gonna miss all your faces,
seeing 'em day after day...

01:23:50.491 --> 01:23:52.537
...year after year.

01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:55.144
I know it hasn't always been easy...

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.798
...but through it all,
we fought hard for each other...

01:23:59.206 --> 01:24:02.327
...and stayed true to who we are.

01:24:03.407 --> 01:24:05.495
No matter what we faced...

01:24:06.494 --> 01:24:08.920
...we always looked out for one another.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.259
So as I...

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:13.640
...as we...

01:24:14.331 --> 01:24:16.815
...start this new chapter in our lives...

01:24:17.995 --> 01:24:20.017
...I want to raise a glass to all of you...

01:24:20.714 --> 01:24:22.237
...because you're my heroes.

01:24:26.003 --> 01:24:27.810
To the end of an era...

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:31.018
...and to new beginnings.

01:24:31.098 --> 01:24:33.858
- Semper paratus!
- Semper paratus.

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.989
Hey, hey.

01:24:42.847 --> 01:24:44.742
Are you okay?

01:24:46.432 --> 01:24:47.776
Has your water broken?

01:24:47.856 --> 01:24:50.739
- Let's go. We're going to the hospital.
- I think so. It's time. It hurts.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.828
- Honey, call the hospital.
- We gotta go!

01:24:52.908 --> 01:24:55.199
- I'll get the car.
- I'll go get the baby bag.

01:24:59.209 --> 01:25:01.077
Get the door.

01:25:04.694 --> 01:25:06.511
Come on, George.

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:10.444
<i>All right, now it is time for your
"Today" weather, and this is one...</i>

01:25:10.524 --> 01:25:13.353
<i>...for the history books
if not a world record.</i>

01:25:13.433 --> 01:25:16.337
<i>There's not a cloud
or a storm on the horizon.</i>

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:21.326
<i>So get out, enjoy some time
with the family on this beautiful day.</i>

01:25:21.406 --> 01:25:24.007
<i>There won't be anything quite like it again.</i>
