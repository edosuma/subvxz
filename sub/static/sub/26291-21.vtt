00:26.434 --> 00:27.234
You weren't followed?

00:27.393 --> 00:29.236
I don't think so.
You don't think or you know?

00:29.436 --> 00:30.989
I did what you told me to do.

00:31.189 --> 00:32.698
I left out the back,
I didn't take my phone.

00:32.898 --> 00:35.243
I drove around for half an hour
before heading here.

00:35.443 --> 00:37.871
I'm not being paranoid,
I'm being careful.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.164
Nobody saw me.
Okay.

00:39.364 --> 00:41.750
Good. Then it's safe to...

00:49.623 --> 00:52.051
Natalie, are you okay?

00:52.251 --> 00:54.179
Oh, what was that?

00:54.379 --> 00:57.265
That was us needing
to get out of here.

00:57.465 --> 00:59.057
Now.

00:59.257 --> 01:01.226
Come on. Come on.

01:01.426 --> 01:02.395

01:26.160 --> 01:27.420
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:28.921 --> 01:30.590
Hey, Ryan.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.591
Sorry to drop in
on you like this.

01:32.791 --> 01:34.259
No. You're
welcome any time.

01:34.459 --> 01:36.221
I was just gonna go grab some
breakfast if you want...

01:36.421 --> 01:38.264
Actually, I was hoping
to speak to you alone.

01:38.464 --> 01:41.433
Sure. Come on.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.478
Everything okay?

01:43.678 --> 01:44.771
Uh, yeah.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.355
Is this room secure?

01:46.555 --> 01:48.274
Swept daily.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.442
Good.

01:52.444 --> 01:55.281
Look, uh...

01:55.481 --> 01:57.075
You know I'm not
in intelligence anymore,

01:57.275 --> 01:58.492
but a lot of people don't.

01:58.692 --> 02:00.118
One of my old contacts
reached out.

02:00.318 --> 02:01.412
Usually, I beg off, but...

02:01.612 --> 02:03.456
But this time...
Is different.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.332
I know, uh, I know this

02:05.532 --> 02:07.626
is the last thing
you want to hear, Dwayne...

02:07.826 --> 02:10.378
but my source says
Apollyon is still active.

02:10.579 --> 02:13.049
And Avery Walker is alive.

02:15.926 --> 02:17.344
But you knew that.

02:17.544 --> 02:19.931
Ryan, you do not want
to be involved with this.

02:20.131 --> 02:21.640
I already am involved.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.143
Why don't we just
grab some breakfast

02:23.343 --> 02:24.811
and leave this conversation
alone. Come on.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.021
This is the man that killed
your father and escaped prison.

02:27.221 --> 02:29.356
And yet...

02:29.556 --> 02:31.276
My source may know where he is.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.320
Okay.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.031
Okay, great.

02:37.231 --> 02:38.533
Okay, give me a name,

02:38.733 --> 02:41.451
I'll meet with him,
leave you out of it.

02:41.651 --> 02:43.162
That's not how this works.

02:43.362 --> 02:45.163
This time it is.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.337
I ran spy networks
for ten years.

02:52.537 --> 02:54.465
The men and women
who were my sources survived

02:54.665 --> 02:56.759
because they trusted me,
and only me.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.176
Ryan...
I don't know why

02:58.376 --> 02:59.846
you're being so resistant.
It was my connection

03:00.046 --> 03:01.472
that helped you take
Apollyon down the last time.

03:01.672 --> 03:04.474
And your connection was killed
in the process.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.394
That is why I can't sit
on the sidelines.

03:06.594 --> 03:09.396
I am well aware
of how dangerous Apollyon is.

03:10.355 --> 03:12.525
I need to do something here.

03:12.725 --> 03:16.111
What'd Hannah
say when you told her?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.450
Our relationship's complicated.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.536
She doesn't know.
We're separated, Dwayne.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.538
My business is not her business.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.497
I'm not okay with that.

03:27.697 --> 03:30.501
It's not your call, mate.

03:30.701 --> 03:32.002
We have an opportunity here.

03:32.202 --> 03:34.254
It's up to you
if you want to squander it.

03:34.454 --> 03:35.882
But I won't.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.557
<i>I hate a car wreck.</i>

03:44.757 --> 03:47.268
Give me a good old
murder scene any day.

03:47.468 --> 03:48.895
Bad experience?

03:49.095 --> 03:51.146
Yeah. Four-car pileup
when Naomi was three.

03:51.346 --> 03:54.067
We were lucky. No serious
injuries, but still...

03:54.267 --> 03:56.569
Well, I wish I could say
the same for our victim.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.072
Commander Sandra Barnes,
she's a doctor

03:59.272 --> 04:02.199
at the Naval Medical Clinic
in Belle Chasse.

04:02.399 --> 04:04.409
Killed on impact?

04:04.609 --> 04:06.663
It appears so.

04:06.863 --> 04:09.623
NOPD says the other
passenger survived.

04:09.823 --> 04:11.376
Natalie Layton, 21.

04:11.576 --> 04:13.377
Studied at Tulane. They
rushed her to the ICU.

04:13.577 --> 04:14.753
Well, this may have been
a hit-and-run,

04:14.953 --> 04:15.754
but it was no accident.

04:15.954 --> 04:17.048
Are you sure?

04:17.248 --> 04:18.423
Based on the tire tread marks,

04:18.623 --> 04:19.884
the suspect rammed them,

04:20.084 --> 04:21.636
then swung around
and did it again.

04:21.836 --> 04:24.221
Well, that suggests
that either Dr. Barnes

04:24.421 --> 04:26.891
or Natalie Layton
were targeted specifically.

04:27.091 --> 04:28.059
Yeah, or both.

04:28.259 --> 04:29.435
I, uh, collected
some paint transfer

04:29.635 --> 04:31.103
from the suspect vehicle.

04:31.303 --> 04:32.896
Maybe that'll help us
narrow down make and model.

04:33.096 --> 04:34.064
Collect this, too.

04:34.264 --> 04:35.441
I found it wedged
under the seat.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.485
Fentanyl.
Yes. The most controlled

04:37.685 --> 04:39.569
of controlled substances,
highly regulated.

04:39.769 --> 04:41.281
Got at least four of them.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.656
It's worth thousands
on the street.

04:42.856 --> 04:44.449
Yeah. What was it doing
in Sandra Barnes's car?

04:44.649 --> 04:46.326
Some kind of drug deal?

04:46.526 --> 04:49.122
We need to find out why
these two were meeting.

04:49.322 --> 04:50.497
If we know
how they're connected,

04:50.697 --> 04:52.125
we might be able
to find their killer.

04:56.295 --> 04:59.465
Honey, you already took
the clonazepam.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.341
You need your trazodone.

05:01.541 --> 05:04.428
Excuse me, are you
Natalie Layton's parents?

05:04.628 --> 05:06.764
I'm her mother. Why?
Any news?

05:06.964 --> 05:08.598
Where is she?

05:08.798 --> 05:12.310
Candace, uh, Natalie's
in surgery, remember?

05:12.510 --> 05:13.980
Doctor said it would be a while.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.814
She's very upset.
I know.

05:16.014 --> 05:17.567
This is a terrible time.
Mm-hmm.

05:17.767 --> 05:19.819
I'm Special Agent
Tammy Gregorio, NCIS.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.279
Special Agent?
I-I don't understand.

05:22.479 --> 05:24.699
There was another victim,
a doctor at a local Navy base.

05:24.899 --> 05:26.701
We're trying to get
who did this, so I need

05:26.901 --> 05:28.827
to ask you a couple of questions, okay?
Of course.

05:29.027 --> 05:30.163
How can we help?
Is there anyone

05:30.363 --> 05:32.831
you can think of who might
want to harm Natalie?

05:33.031 --> 05:35.834
Everyone loves Natalie.
I'm sorry.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.461
We were told
this was an accident.

05:37.661 --> 05:40.505
What happened out there
was deliberate.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.218
Natalie's a good girl.

05:45.418 --> 05:47.012
Captain of the volleyball team.

05:47.212 --> 05:48.555
Straight A's in school.

05:48.755 --> 05:50.348
I can't imagine anyone
would want to hurt her.

05:50.548 --> 05:53.060
Of-of course not.
She's my baby.

05:53.260 --> 05:57.189
The woman she was with,
Dr. Sandra Barnes...

05:57.389 --> 05:59.649
We heard she didn't make it.

05:59.849 --> 06:00.442
Unfortunately, no.

06:00.642 --> 06:02.360
Any idea how they
knew each other?

06:02.560 --> 06:03.571
None at all.

06:03.771 --> 06:05.238
Mr. and Mrs. Samuels?

06:05.438 --> 06:07.992
Oh, God, tell me
that Natalie's okay.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.494
She made it through surgery.

06:09.694 --> 06:11.245
We've stopped
the internal hemorrhaging,

06:11.445 --> 06:12.872
but there's still a lot
of swelling in the brain.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.915
But she'll be all right?
We hope so.

06:15.115 --> 06:16.542
We've induced a coma
to give her some time

06:16.742 --> 06:17.709
for the swelling to go down.

06:17.909 --> 06:19.377
You can see her if you'd like.

06:19.577 --> 06:20.629
One sec.

06:25.884 --> 06:29.180
Look, I feel like I'm
betraying confidences here,

06:29.380 --> 06:32.100
but, the thing is, when Candace
and I met a couple years ago,

06:32.300 --> 06:34.101
Natalie was having some issues.

06:34.301 --> 06:35.603
What kind of issues?

06:35.803 --> 06:37.605
She had a serious knee injury
her freshman year.

06:37.805 --> 06:40.566
Took opioids for the pain,
and, uh...

06:40.766 --> 06:42.192
It got out of hand?
Yeah.

06:42.392 --> 06:43.694
But she's cleaned up her act.

06:43.894 --> 06:45.196
Took time off from school.

06:45.396 --> 06:46.613
Went to rehab.

06:46.813 --> 06:49.242
She had a relapse,
but she's better now.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.909
I wouldn't have
even mentioned it,

06:51.109 --> 06:53.620
but you said the other woman
was a doctor,

06:53.820 --> 06:56.206
and that's how Natalie
used to score her pills.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.427
Turns out the only
clear connection

07:08.627 --> 07:11.221
between our Navy doctor and
the college student is drugs.

07:11.421 --> 07:14.016
Natalie as a user
and Dr. Barnes as a pusher.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.101
Well, that doesn't track.
Dr. Barnes's record is clean.

07:16.301 --> 07:19.062
Well, her Navy record is,
but her personal record,

07:19.262 --> 07:20.605
not so much.

07:20.805 --> 07:21.983
Before joining the military,
Dr. Barnes had

07:22.183 --> 07:23.608
a private practice in Memphis.

07:23.808 --> 07:24.776
Yeah, and this was ten years ago

07:24.976 --> 07:26.319
and it was very successful.

07:26.519 --> 07:28.281
Until she was accused

07:28.481 --> 07:31.783
of dealing medical-grade opioids
and her practice fell apart.

07:31.983 --> 07:34.286
That the Navy doctor
who was killed last night?

07:34.486 --> 07:35.745
Yeah. Think there
might be a drug angle.

07:35.945 --> 07:38.331
If Dr. Barnes was dealing,

07:38.531 --> 07:40.084
how did she keep
her medical license?

07:40.284 --> 07:42.670
No hard evidence,
just a lot of missing drugs.

07:42.870 --> 07:45.255
But her practice went under
due to all the scrutiny.

07:45.455 --> 07:48.300
Yeah. Dr. Barnes's marriage
broke up because of it, too.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.843
Her ex-husband accused her

07:50.043 --> 07:52.680
of being a drug addict
in the divorce.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.932
Through it all, she swore
she was being set up.

07:55.132 --> 07:56.850
No issues since she joined
the Navy?

07:57.050 --> 07:59.812
She turned her life around.
Least, that's the way it seemed.

08:00.012 --> 08:04.274
None of that points to
a motive for murder.

08:04.474 --> 08:05.610
Chris, will you check
on Dr. Barnes's clinic

08:05.810 --> 08:07.653
at Belle Chasse? See if
any fentanyl is missing.

08:07.853 --> 08:08.653
On it.

08:08.853 --> 08:09.822
We still need confirmation

08:10.022 --> 08:11.615
on why these two women
were meeting.

08:11.815 --> 08:12.742
How'd they know each other?

08:12.942 --> 08:14.492
You know what? I might be able
to find out something

08:14.692 --> 08:16.454
in texts or e-mails.
Okay.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.372
You stopping by
to check on the case?

08:19.572 --> 08:21.209
Actually, I came
here to see you.

08:21.409 --> 08:23.252
Oh.
Can we talk?

08:24.377 --> 08:26.630
Yeah.

08:30.175 --> 08:32.845
So is this, uh,
work or personal?

08:33.044 --> 08:34.679
Bit of both.

08:34.879 --> 08:36.057
And strictly off the books.

08:36.256 --> 08:37.807
Okay.
As you know,

08:38.006 --> 08:40.477
I've been involved
in something lately.

08:40.677 --> 08:44.649
I know that you were removed
from SAC briefly.

08:44.849 --> 08:46.650
Almost left New Orleans
to take a position

08:46.850 --> 08:48.818
as an international liaison

08:49.018 --> 08:52.365
which didn't actually exist,
but you stayed.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.700
Few weeks ago, I was approached
by Raymond Isler.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.034
Oh, FBI, right?

08:56.234 --> 08:57.827
Yeah, I heard good things. Yeah.

08:58.027 --> 09:00.038
Isler is part of a task force

09:00.238 --> 09:01.749
that shares my suspicion

09:01.949 --> 09:05.378
that Avery Walker
is still alive,

09:05.578 --> 09:08.214
and has taken over
the Apollyon network.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.716
They're going after him?
Yes.

09:10.916 --> 09:12.927
They asked me to join.

09:13.127 --> 09:16.179
The international liaison job
was gonna be my cover.

09:16.379 --> 09:19.392
But, as you know,
I turned them down.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.979
I am supporting them from here.

09:23.179 --> 09:25.355
But so far,
Avery's been tough to track.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.191
However, we've got a new lead

09:27.391 --> 09:30.403
and we... need to follow it up.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.529
What can I do to help?

09:32.729 --> 09:34.865
It's not your help that we need.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.119
It's Ryan's.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.746
Ryan is out of the game.

09:41.946 --> 09:44.250
Still has contacts.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.584
He is a college professor.

09:45.784 --> 09:47.211
One of his sources reached out.

09:47.411 --> 09:48.796
About Apollyon?

09:48.996 --> 09:51.591
Says he or she has information.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.759
It's out of the question.
Hannah.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.760
Dwayne, you know
how dangerous Apollyon is.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.178
Ryan can't be part of it.

09:57.378 --> 09:58.389
He already is.

09:58.589 --> 10:00.557
Look, he came to me.

10:00.757 --> 10:01.975
Then you go to him and tell him

10:02.175 --> 10:03.644
to stay out of it.
I don't think he'll listen.

10:03.844 --> 10:04.687
Make him.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.605
Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt...

10:06.805 --> 10:08.606
whatever this is, but I just
got back from the hospital,

10:08.806 --> 10:10.442
and Patton's got something.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.114
Hey.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.657
What'd you find, Patton?

10:16.857 --> 10:18.951
Not what I was expecting,
that's for sure.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.952
Started looking through
Sandra's texts,

10:21.152 --> 10:22.788
and I found a chain
between her and Natalie.

10:22.988 --> 10:24.789
Do the texts indicate
why they were meeting?

10:24.989 --> 10:26.667
Had something to do
with her ex-husband.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.461
She was warning Natalie
to be careful.

10:28.661 --> 10:29.586
Sandra was divorced
ten years ago.

10:29.786 --> 10:30.671
What does it have to do
with Natalie?

10:30.871 --> 10:33.673
My question exactly,
so I started doing some digging.

10:33.873 --> 10:35.801
This is Natalie's mom
and her husband,

10:36.001 --> 10:36.969
Dylan Samuels.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.303
That's Natalie's stepdad.

10:38.503 --> 10:39.471
They've been married
almost a year.

10:39.671 --> 10:40.597
And this

10:40.797 --> 10:42.140
is Sandra Barnes
and her ex-husband,

10:42.340 --> 10:43.350
William Flynn,

10:43.550 --> 10:45.144
ten years ago.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.441
That's the same man.

10:50.641 --> 10:52.192
Natalie's mom is married

10:52.392 --> 10:54.028
to our victim's ex.

10:54.228 --> 10:56.654
Seems like something
he would've mentioned, huh?

11:10.668 --> 11:13.172
Dylan Samuels
legally changed his name

11:13.372 --> 11:15.673
from William Flynn
ten years ago.

11:15.873 --> 11:17.676
What else do we know about him?
He's a scumbag.

11:17.876 --> 11:20.303
Got the court transcripts
from his divorce.

11:20.503 --> 11:23.349
He lied to Sandra Barnes
from the start.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.682
Spent all her money. Racked up

11:24.882 --> 11:26.519
another 300K.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.144
Put her in debt.
All under her name.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.523
And accused her
of being a drug dealer.

11:30.723 --> 11:31.649
But his testimony

11:31.849 --> 11:33.024
says that Sandra stole meds

11:33.224 --> 11:34.025
from her own practice.

11:34.225 --> 11:35.360
Started using.
That's what caused

11:35.560 --> 11:36.360
her financial ruin.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.322
Of course he blamed her.
What do you expect?

11:38.522 --> 11:40.740
Well, Dylan had credit card and
bank statements to back it up.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.158
Because he planned
the whole thing.

11:42.358 --> 11:43.369
He's probably doing
the same thing

11:43.569 --> 11:44.828
to his current wife, Candace.

11:45.028 --> 11:46.163
Eyes on the prize here.

11:46.363 --> 11:47.748
Sandra was murdered.

11:47.948 --> 11:48.874
Candace's daughter's in the ICU.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.918
Was Dylan Samuels involved?

11:51.118 --> 11:52.211
Of course he was.
Okay.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.379
- Do we have evidence?
- Well,

11:53.579 --> 11:55.588
I can't tell you whose car
smashed into Dr. Barnes',

11:55.788 --> 11:58.926
but I can narrow down
the make, model and color

11:59.126 --> 12:01.345
based on the traces
of paint I got.

12:01.545 --> 12:02.929
Indigo blue?

12:03.129 --> 12:03.931
Yeah. I'm more

12:04.131 --> 12:05.349
of a royal blue man myself,

12:05.549 --> 12:06.683
but this color was very popular

12:06.883 --> 12:08.394
for Chevrolets
in the early aughts.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.019
Only thing is that there are

12:10.219 --> 12:12.398
2,000 indigo blue Chevys
registered in New Orleans.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.775
Dylan Samuels owns one of them.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.738
He owns a 2002 Tahoe.

12:19.938 --> 12:21.030
He's our suspect.

12:21.230 --> 12:22.615
Well, let's take it
one step at a time.

12:22.815 --> 12:24.618
You heard Sebastian.
There's 2,000 cars

12:24.818 --> 12:25.744
in that exact same color.

12:25.944 --> 12:27.203
Are you saying he's innocent?

12:27.403 --> 12:29.414
No, Gregorio.
But I'm saying we need

12:29.614 --> 12:30.957
to follow the evidence.

12:31.157 --> 12:31.957
Did I miss something here?

12:31.992 --> 12:33.251
Listen, he changed his name.

12:33.451 --> 12:34.961
He has the car.
I don't care

12:35.161 --> 12:36.797
what the court documents say.
Trust me.

12:36.997 --> 12:38.966
If anyone knows a con man,
it's me.

12:39.166 --> 12:39.966
I was married to one.

12:40.166 --> 12:42.470
Ethan McKinley was a jerk.

12:42.670 --> 12:43.721
And a sociopath and a liar.

12:43.921 --> 12:44.804
All of the above.

12:45.004 --> 12:46.432
And we trust your
instincts, Gregorio.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.267
Now go find the proof.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.894
Talk to Candace Samuels.

12:50.094 --> 12:51.479
See what she can tell
you about her husband.

12:51.679 --> 12:52.897
I'm all over it.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.274
You coming or what?

13:00.278 --> 13:03.908
See if I can get a
warrant on Samuels' SUV.

13:04.108 --> 13:05.993
Any idea where Hannah went?

13:06.193 --> 13:08.578
No, she left. Said she
had personal business.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.087
Sorry, guys. Excuse me a minute.

13:20.798 --> 13:22.634
We're not together
anymore, Hannah.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.095
Your disapproving looks
hold no sway.

13:25.295 --> 13:26.804
What were you thinking?

13:27.004 --> 13:28.849
Yeah, I'm not a fan
of the tone, either.

13:29.807 --> 13:31.936
Okay. Okay.

13:32.136 --> 13:34.145
Look, this is too dangerous.

13:34.345 --> 13:36.524
You're not even in
intelligence anymore.

13:36.724 --> 13:37.982
That didn't stop you from
bringing me in the last time.

13:38.182 --> 13:39.150
Yeah, but that was different.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.985
We didn't know what
we were up against.

13:41.185 --> 13:42.278
But you do now. Don't you think
it would have been smart

13:42.478 --> 13:43.404
to have let me know
Apollyon were back?

13:43.604 --> 13:45.990
Oh, come on, Ryan, I'm not
hiding anything from you.

13:46.190 --> 13:47.868
I promised that I wouldn't.

13:48.068 --> 13:50.037
So you keep your promises now?

13:52.121 --> 13:55.167
This isn't about us or the past.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.671
You need to stay away
from Apollyon or...

13:58.871 --> 14:00.673
Listen to me.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.674
If you go after them,

14:02.874 --> 14:05.760
me, Naomi, you,
we're all a target.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.013
We're not going after Apollyon.
Come on.

14:08.213 --> 14:09.847
Allow that I know you
better than anyone.

14:10.047 --> 14:11.892
You will go after them,
and we will be in danger.

14:12.092 --> 14:13.686
Let me help.

14:13.886 --> 14:14.894
You can't be involved.

14:15.094 --> 14:16.397
Too late.

14:16.597 --> 14:18.899
Another advantage
of us not being together

14:19.099 --> 14:22.110
is I don't have to consult you
on every decision.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.653
I'm in the right here.

14:23.853 --> 14:25.530
If you won't act on my intel,

14:25.730 --> 14:28.075
I have plenty of contacts
that will.

14:28.275 --> 14:30.034
You cannot

14:30.234 --> 14:33.080
make unilateral decisions
that affect <i> our</i> family.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.332
Sure I can.
I learned from the best.

14:44.248 --> 14:45.717
If this Dylan Samuels is here,

14:45.917 --> 14:47.344
we should probably
tread carefully.

14:47.544 --> 14:49.221
Why, so I don't punch him in the nose?
Exactly.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.222
Uh, excuse me. Mrs. Samuels?

14:51.422 --> 14:53.558
Who are you?
We met earlier.

14:53.758 --> 14:55.852
I'm Tammy Gregorio, NCIS.

14:56.052 --> 14:58.062
How's Natalie doing?

14:58.262 --> 15:00.190
My poor baby.

15:00.390 --> 15:02.942
They said that they were
gonna take her out of the coma,

15:03.142 --> 15:04.903
but when are they
gonna wake her up?

15:05.103 --> 15:06.238
We'll see if we can

15:06.438 --> 15:07.780
find out for you.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.240
Is your husband here?

15:09.440 --> 15:10.618
Dylan went home.

15:10.818 --> 15:12.577
Said I needed
something clean to wear.

15:12.777 --> 15:14.245
Looking out for
you. That's sweet.

15:14.445 --> 15:16.081
You guys are still
newlyweds, right?

15:16.281 --> 15:18.042
Well, I guess so. About a year.

15:18.242 --> 15:19.043
We got together

15:19.243 --> 15:21.086
a little after
my previous husband had died.

15:21.286 --> 15:24.631
I-I'd been so depressed
for so long, and...

15:24.831 --> 15:26.759
Well, how'd y'all meet?

15:26.959 --> 15:29.427
I'm a financial planner,
and Dylan was a new client.

15:29.627 --> 15:32.056
And he recently lost someone
that he loved, too.

15:32.256 --> 15:33.724
What a coincidence.

15:33.924 --> 15:36.018
Sometimes fate works like that.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.769
Yeah.

15:37.969 --> 15:40.272
How much do you know
about Dylan?

15:40.472 --> 15:42.774
About his background?

15:42.974 --> 15:44.985
Not sure what you mean.

15:45.185 --> 15:47.111
Well, did you know
that he was married before?

15:47.311 --> 15:48.113
Under a different name.

15:48.313 --> 15:50.823
To a Sandra Barnes, woman
who died last night.

15:51.023 --> 15:52.451
Oh, yes. He told me.

15:52.651 --> 15:53.994
What?

15:54.194 --> 15:55.412
Really?

15:55.612 --> 15:57.914
Woman didn't deserve
to die, but...

15:58.114 --> 15:59.917
I mean,
she was terrible to Dylan.

16:00.117 --> 16:02.126
Jealous. Possessive.

16:02.326 --> 16:03.961
And the lies
that she made up about him

16:04.161 --> 16:05.129
nearly ruined his life.

16:05.329 --> 16:07.674
And then she approaches
my daughter.

16:07.874 --> 16:09.592
Unbelievable.
Okay, but why didn't you or your husband

16:09.792 --> 16:10.969
tell me that you knew

16:11.169 --> 16:12.053
Dr. Barnes?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.764
Who?

16:14.964 --> 16:17.100
Your husband's ex-wife.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.976
The murder victim.

16:19.176 --> 16:20.354
- When did he tell you about her?
- Yeah.

16:20.554 --> 16:23.774
Was it before or after
Dr. Barnes was killed?

16:23.974 --> 16:25.817
You're making me
very uncomfortable.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.360
Ms. Samuels.
I-I'm sorry.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.321
I can't do this right now.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.948
Um, you need to let me focus on Natalie.
Now, wait a minute.

16:32.148 --> 16:34.784
Do you know why your daughter
was with Dr. Barnes last night?

16:34.984 --> 16:36.036
I have nothing more to say.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.375
Pretty strong feelings
about Sandra Barnes.

16:41.575 --> 16:42.835
Dylan did a good job

16:43.035 --> 16:44.836
of poisoning her opinion.

16:45.036 --> 16:48.173
Okay, but...
she got pretty evasive

16:48.373 --> 16:50.008
when we was probing
about last night.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.969
So now you think Candace
could be involved

16:52.169 --> 16:54.178
in the murder of Dr. Barnes?
No.

16:54.378 --> 16:56.181
I think she was evasive.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.142
She's hiding something,
and you feel it, too.

17:10.903 --> 17:12.070
Hey, Ryan.

17:12.271 --> 17:13.699
Hannah just paid me a visit.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.031
I assume that's your doing.

17:15.232 --> 17:16.034
I had to tell her.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.034
Well, our philosophies on what

17:17.193 --> 17:20.247
constitutes "confidential"
seem to differ.

17:20.446 --> 17:21.664
Well, she has a stake in this.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.169
Anyway, I've arranged to meet

17:25.368 --> 17:27.336
the friend we discussed
later tonight.

17:27.536 --> 17:28.505
No, no, we need to talk.

17:28.705 --> 17:29.714
I'm done talking.

17:29.914 --> 17:30.923
His information's
time-sensitive,

17:31.123 --> 17:32.049
so I'm gonna need to know

17:32.249 --> 17:34.010
pretty quickly whether or not
you're moving forward.

17:34.210 --> 17:35.554
But you need to know I am.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.138
Look, Ryan...

17:41.101 --> 17:42.560
Bad news?

17:42.760 --> 17:43.936
Good news maybe.

17:44.136 --> 17:46.230
That's the worst good news face
I've ever seen.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.317
I'm in a situation.

17:48.517 --> 17:49.567
I got a chance

17:49.767 --> 17:52.195
to acquire something
potentially very valuable.

17:52.395 --> 17:54.239
But?
But getting it

17:54.439 --> 17:56.407
could damage an
important relationship.

17:56.607 --> 17:59.577
Hmm. Sounds like it comes down
to which you value more.

17:59.777 --> 18:01.246
It's not that simple.

18:01.446 --> 18:03.373
These things rarely are.

18:03.573 --> 18:06.960
Sandra Barnes's autopsy,
for instance.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.377
Cause of death was no surprise.

18:08.577 --> 18:10.923
Blunt force trauma and
internal hemorrhaging.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.049
Consistent with the impact.

18:13.249 --> 18:15.093
Seems simple enough.
Yes.

18:15.293 --> 18:18.471
But part of her liver
showed signs of zonal necrosis.

18:18.671 --> 18:21.266
And that coupled with evidence
of lipotoxicity

18:21.466 --> 18:24.269
and fibrosis indicate
that Dr. Barnes

18:24.469 --> 18:26.105
had toxic liver disease.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.815
Nothing in her Navy
files about it.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.734
I estimate this
from about ten years ago.

18:31.934 --> 18:34.613
When she was still
married to Dylan Samuels.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.074
Exactly. Which made me curious,

18:37.274 --> 18:39.284
so I pulled her medical records,

18:39.484 --> 18:43.121
and there's no indication
of liver disease

18:43.321 --> 18:45.207
anywhere in them,

18:45.407 --> 18:46.207
although it's possible

18:46.325 --> 18:48.626
that it was
a drug-induced condition.

18:48.826 --> 18:51.296
In the divorce filings,

18:51.496 --> 18:54.258
Samuels accused her
of using her own opioids.

18:54.458 --> 18:58.177
Yes. But that damage
was not caused by opioids.

18:58.377 --> 18:59.637
This was much more toxic

18:59.837 --> 19:01.807
and administered
over a long period.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.767
Any more insight?

19:03.967 --> 19:07.270
After ten years, I'm afraid not.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.815
Maybe Dylan Samuels
can fill in the blanks.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.483
Time for him to come clean
about the past.

19:12.683 --> 19:13.693
Thanks, Loretta.

19:16.028 --> 19:20.325
No one ever really knows
what happens in a marriage.

19:20.525 --> 19:23.871
Sandra painted a picture of me

19:24.071 --> 19:27.332
as a controlling,
abusive husband.

19:27.532 --> 19:30.335
But she was the manipulator
in the relationship.

19:30.535 --> 19:31.627
How's that?

19:31.827 --> 19:34.673
She had a serious drug problem.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.215
It consumed her.

19:36.415 --> 19:38.218
And pretty soon, it consumed me.

19:38.418 --> 19:40.679
I begged her to go to rehab.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.055
What was she taking?

19:42.255 --> 19:43.307
Pain pills mostly.

19:43.507 --> 19:45.308
God knows what else.

19:45.508 --> 19:47.102
She had access to so much.

19:47.302 --> 19:49.020
She was stealing
from her practice.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.314
Racking up debt.

19:50.514 --> 19:52.816
I had to get out.

19:53.016 --> 19:55.152
I got to say, I find it hard
to believe anything you say

19:55.352 --> 19:58.195
since you lied right to my face
about even knowing her.

19:58.395 --> 19:59.489
I was in shock.

19:59.689 --> 20:00.865
My stepdaughter
fighting for her life

20:01.065 --> 20:02.576
in the ICU.

20:02.776 --> 20:05.703
My wife
barely keeping it together.

20:05.903 --> 20:08.080
I'm not trying to hide anything.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.083
Well, you did change your name.

20:10.283 --> 20:11.710
Sandra ruined my life.

20:11.910 --> 20:14.211
She was telling our friends
I was cheating on her.

20:14.411 --> 20:16.088
Stealing from her.

20:16.288 --> 20:17.673
Tried to get the
police to arrest me

20:17.873 --> 20:19.217
three times.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.219
I needed a fresh start.

20:21.419 --> 20:23.721
A new name helped.
Okay, Mr. Samuels.

20:23.921 --> 20:25.891
Or Flynn
or whatever your name is.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.269
Do you own a 2002 Chevy Tahoe?
Yeah.

20:29.469 --> 20:30.519
Where is that vehicle right now?

20:30.719 --> 20:32.271
Because we can't seem
to find it.

20:32.471 --> 20:34.231
It was stolen, actually.
Two days ago.

20:34.431 --> 20:35.442
You continue to have

20:35.642 --> 20:37.068
very bad luck.

20:37.268 --> 20:39.363
Why do you want to know
about my car?

20:39.563 --> 20:41.240
Because we found traces of paint
at the crime scene

20:41.440 --> 20:42.449
that match it.

20:44.451 --> 20:48.204
I filed a police
report this morning.

20:48.404 --> 20:51.333
You can check. It was stolen.

20:51.533 --> 20:52.416
Okay, well, you understand

20:52.616 --> 20:54.920
how convenient that sounds?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.381
I mean, that vehicle
could very well be the one

20:57.581 --> 21:00.259
used to murder your ex,

21:00.459 --> 21:04.136
the woman you say
ruined your life.

21:04.336 --> 21:06.097
I don't even know what you want.

21:06.297 --> 21:08.557
How about you quit lying
and tell us the truth for once?

21:08.757 --> 21:11.269
If your car
was stolen two days ago,

21:11.469 --> 21:13.563
why wait to make
the police report?

21:13.763 --> 21:16.273
While your stepdaughter was
fighting for her life in ICU.

21:16.473 --> 21:17.942
I can't...

21:18.142 --> 21:19.987
I mean...

21:20.187 --> 21:21.738
I don't even know for sure.

21:21.938 --> 21:23.155
Come on.

21:23.355 --> 21:25.282
Dylan...

21:25.482 --> 21:28.537
clearly, there's something
you want to tell us.

21:31.163 --> 21:32.958
Please...

21:33.158 --> 21:34.417
you can't blame her.

21:34.617 --> 21:36.086
She was just scared,

21:36.286 --> 21:37.796
for both of us.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.839
And I just, I want
to protect her.

21:40.039 --> 21:41.967
What does that mean?

21:42.167 --> 21:44.176
It's Candace.

21:44.376 --> 21:45.971
I think she took my car.

21:46.171 --> 21:48.390
That night.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.435
I think she killed Sandra.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.153
You see it, right?

22:01.353 --> 22:03.154
This guy has an answer
for everything.

22:03.354 --> 22:04.823
He's claiming Candace
tried to kill

22:05.023 --> 22:06.782
her own daughter...
that's ridiculous.

22:06.982 --> 22:09.786
Yes. So we'll let him stew
in there for a while.

22:09.986 --> 22:11.038
Check his story.

22:11.238 --> 22:12.873
Find evidence to disprove it.

22:13.073 --> 22:13.873
Pride.

22:13.949 --> 22:16.000
I got the evidence
you're looking for.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.836
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

22:18.036 --> 22:18.836
What do you mean, P?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.422
I've been scanning
through traffic cams

22:20.622 --> 22:21.673
from the night of the murder.
Yeah?

22:21.873 --> 22:25.469
I I.D.'d Dylan Samuels' SUV
three blocks from the crash site

22:25.669 --> 22:28.346
just before Sandra and Natalie got hit.
That's great, P.

22:28.546 --> 22:30.682
That's exactly what
we're looking for. Yeah.

22:30.882 --> 22:31.849
It <i> would</i> be.

22:32.049 --> 22:32.851
The only thing...

22:35.979 --> 22:37.521
That's not Dylan
behind the wheel.

22:37.721 --> 22:38.940
That's Candace.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.165
Hey.

22:56.365 --> 22:57.165
Hey.

22:57.284 --> 22:58.125
I didn't hear you
come home last night.

22:58.325 --> 23:00.170
Did you pull an all-nighter?
I'm trying to find

23:00.370 --> 23:01.797
everything I can
to prove that Dylan's lying.

23:01.997 --> 23:04.215
It just still bugs me
we let him go, man.

23:04.415 --> 23:06.550
Went through his and
Sandra's divorce records,

23:06.750 --> 23:08.385
and every scrap
of information I can find

23:08.585 --> 23:10.055
on his marriage
to Candace, but...

23:10.255 --> 23:11.431
Yeah? No luck?
Guy's really good

23:11.631 --> 23:13.724
at covering his tracks,
I'll give him that.

23:13.924 --> 23:16.353
Well, maybe it's because...
and don't hit me...

23:16.553 --> 23:19.314
uh, he's actually innocent.

23:19.514 --> 23:21.732
No. He set up Sandra Barnes,
stole her money,

23:21.932 --> 23:23.734
portrayed her as an
addict and a dealer,

23:23.934 --> 23:25.403
and now he's trying to set up

23:25.603 --> 23:27.404
his current wife
and frame her for murder.

23:27.604 --> 23:28.906
Right, but, I mean,
it was definitely Candace

23:29.106 --> 23:30.909
behind the wheel of that car...
the photos don't lie.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.369
He's a con man, Sebastian.
He's playing us.

23:33.569 --> 23:35.747
And you don't think that...

23:35.947 --> 23:38.208
again, I would hate to get hit...

23:38.408 --> 23:40.919
you don't think that your
judgment's a little clouded?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.423
You know what?

23:45.623 --> 23:47.592
You never get over being conned.

23:47.792 --> 23:49.760
Especially when it's
someone you love,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.805
someone you trusted.

23:52.005 --> 23:54.598
That man almost
broke me, Sebastian.

23:54.798 --> 23:57.434
Yeah, and you can't even say
McKinley's name.

23:57.634 --> 23:59.270
Yeah, I can. Miserable
Lying Son of a Bitch.

23:59.470 --> 24:01.815
Well, that does have a certain ring to it.
Took me years

24:02.015 --> 24:03.817
to get back on my
feet, but I did.

24:04.017 --> 24:05.442
And what I went through...

24:05.642 --> 24:07.444
didn't cloud my
judgment, Sebastian.

24:07.644 --> 24:09.446
It just made me
see more clearly.

24:09.646 --> 24:11.240
Guys like this...

24:11.440 --> 24:13.117
they don't fool me.

24:13.317 --> 24:15.744
Not anymore.

24:15.944 --> 24:18.455
All right...
how can I help?

24:22.085 --> 24:23.461
Arrest warrant for Candace
Samuels just went through.

24:23.661 --> 24:24.921
Pride and Hannah are
on their way

24:25.121 --> 24:26.423
to the hospital
to see if she's there.

24:26.623 --> 24:27.632
Hannah wants me and Lasalle

24:27.832 --> 24:29.092
to go check her house.
Hey, look,

24:29.292 --> 24:30.926
you know, I can go instead...
you're exhausted.

24:31.126 --> 24:32.304
No, I got this.

24:32.504 --> 24:35.848
Hey, this doesn't mean
we're gonna stop digging, okay?

24:36.048 --> 24:37.517
If Dylan really did this,
we're gonna get him.

24:37.717 --> 24:40.060
I know. Thanks.

24:46.483 --> 24:48.987
Candace Samuels isn't here.

24:49.187 --> 24:51.323
Apparently, she left last night,
hasn't been back since.

24:51.523 --> 24:52.365
Well, that's odd.

24:52.565 --> 24:54.201
Seeing as she was sitting vigil

24:54.401 --> 24:56.493
for her daughter all this time.
Lasalle and Gregorio

24:56.693 --> 24:58.829
are heading to her house now,
see if they can find her there.

24:59.029 --> 25:00.373
They'll find her.

25:00.573 --> 25:03.210
Listen, I heard you
talked to Ryan.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.670
It was less of a talk;
it was more of a...

25:05.870 --> 25:09.007
skirmish.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.634
Sorry if I got in the middle.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.219
No, it wasn't you, Dwayne.

25:12.419 --> 25:15.555
It's Ryan... he's stubborn;
he thinks he knows best.

25:15.755 --> 25:18.182
I am just looking out for Naomi.

25:18.382 --> 25:20.309
I imagine he'd say the same.

25:20.509 --> 25:23.063
Just trying
to figure out if I'm so upset

25:23.263 --> 25:24.814
because he's
putting himself in danger

25:25.014 --> 25:27.651
or because he didn't even think
to tell me about it.

25:27.851 --> 25:29.861
Probably a bit of both.

25:31.445 --> 25:33.573
Ryan's making contact
with his source

25:33.773 --> 25:35.659
whether we like it or not.

25:35.859 --> 25:37.493
I'm asking you to put
your personal feelings

25:37.693 --> 25:39.537
aside on this one.

25:39.737 --> 25:41.664
It's too important.

25:45.042 --> 25:47.295
Natalie Layton's awake.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.052
- Where's my mom?
- We're not sure.

25:55.252 --> 25:56.762
We're looking for her.

25:56.962 --> 25:59.473
- What's going on here?
- You were in a car

25:59.673 --> 26:01.768
with Sandra Barnes.

26:01.968 --> 26:03.478
It got hit.

26:03.678 --> 26:05.105
Sandra...

26:05.305 --> 26:06.940
Is she okay?

26:07.140 --> 26:08.357
I'm sorry, she...

26:08.557 --> 26:10.234
she didn't make it.

26:15.281 --> 26:17.241
She...

26:17.441 --> 26:19.035
she told me to be careful.

26:19.235 --> 26:21.037
I... I tried.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.625
But Dylan found us.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.255
You saw Dylan that night?

26:30.455 --> 26:32.257
No, but I know he hit us.

26:32.457 --> 26:34.425
We were going to expose him.

26:34.625 --> 26:36.051
And he wouldn't let that happen.

26:36.251 --> 26:38.762
What did Sandra
tell you about Dylan?

26:38.962 --> 26:41.141
That he drugged her.

26:41.341 --> 26:43.559
Made her question
her own sanity.

26:43.759 --> 26:45.228
Took all her money.

26:45.428 --> 26:47.396
That he was doing the
same thing to my mom.

26:47.596 --> 26:49.106
You believed her?

26:49.306 --> 26:51.608
Mom's the most steady,
practical person ever.

26:51.808 --> 26:55.279
That all changed when
Dylan came into our lives.

26:55.479 --> 26:58.657
The longer she's been with him,
the more of a mess she's become.

27:00.117 --> 27:02.244
Me, too.

27:02.444 --> 27:04.788
Natalie, I know this is hard.

27:04.988 --> 27:06.458
We found...

27:06.658 --> 27:09.461
fentanyl in Sandra's car.

27:09.661 --> 27:13.298
We understand
you're in recovery.

27:13.498 --> 27:15.674
That you had a relapse recently.

27:15.874 --> 27:17.259
I didn't have a relapse.

27:17.459 --> 27:19.846
Well, Dylan said...
Dylan is the one who did it to me.

27:20.046 --> 27:22.682
I was trying to get dirt
on him, protect my mom.

27:22.882 --> 27:25.018
One night I was
studying at home,

27:25.218 --> 27:27.479
had a blackout...

27:27.679 --> 27:30.773
and when I woke up, there
was a bottle of pills.

27:30.973 --> 27:32.483
Mom was pissed.

27:32.683 --> 27:34.486
Convinced
I'd fallen off the wagon.

27:34.686 --> 27:38.698
But I swear, I haven't touched
anything in 18 months.

27:38.898 --> 27:40.991
You think Dylan
slipped you the drugs?

27:41.191 --> 27:43.494
Yes. I tried
to convince mom,

27:43.694 --> 27:45.579
but she's blind when
it comes to Dylan.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.709
Where <i> is</i> my mother?
Natalie,

27:49.909 --> 27:51.836
we have evidence
that suggests that the car

27:52.036 --> 27:53.962
that struck you and Sandra...

27:54.162 --> 27:56.340
was driven by your mother.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.675
That's not...
that's not possible.

27:58.875 --> 28:01.136
No. Don't you see?
This is what Sandra

28:01.336 --> 28:02.680
said would happen.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.848
Oh, my God, he's gonna get
away with it, isn't he?

28:05.048 --> 28:06.683
Mom's gonna...

28:06.883 --> 28:09.229
Hey, okay, hey, hey.
Take a breath.

28:09.429 --> 28:11.314
That's right.

28:11.514 --> 28:14.025
We're gonna get to the truth.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.859
I promise you.

28:16.059 --> 28:17.153
Actually, if Dylan

28:17.353 --> 28:20.198
did drug you,
we might be able to prove it.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.825
We're gonna need your help.

28:22.025 --> 28:23.660
Of course.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.077
Anything.

28:25.277 --> 28:26.829
A sample of your blood?

28:32.085 --> 28:34.295
NCIS. Open up.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.882
This is bordering on harassment.

28:38.082 --> 28:40.884
We're not here to see you.
We're here to see Candace.

28:41.084 --> 28:43.721
Well, unfortunately, Candace is
in a very fragile state right now.

28:43.921 --> 28:44.931
You can't see her.

28:45.131 --> 28:46.432
Well, this is not a request.

28:46.632 --> 28:47.724
We brought a warrant.

28:47.924 --> 28:49.810
Unless you're giving us a reason

28:50.010 --> 28:50.810
to arrest you for obstruction.

28:50.928 --> 28:53.690
You want to come in,
be my guest.

28:53.890 --> 28:55.900
But Candace is not here
right now.

28:56.100 --> 28:56.942
Where is she?

28:57.142 --> 28:59.737
Under counsel of my lawyers
and her psychiatrist,

28:59.937 --> 29:02.906
I've taken steps to guarantee
she gets the help she needs.

29:03.106 --> 29:03.991
Candace is undergoing

29:04.191 --> 29:06.618
a full psychiatric assessment
at the Kenter Clinic.

29:06.818 --> 29:08.121
You had her committed.

29:08.321 --> 29:09.913
We'll see what Natalie
has to say about that.

29:10.113 --> 29:12.208
I have power of attorney
over Candace's estate,

29:12.408 --> 29:14.419
including her
Advance Health Care Directive.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.587
I decide what is best for her.

29:16.787 --> 29:18.256
Oh, it's perfect.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.758
Buys you enough time to
clean out her accounts, right,

29:20.958 --> 29:23.135
and then disappear.
You're out of line.

29:23.335 --> 29:25.430
<i>I'm</i> out of line?
My wife is a sick woman.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.891
She's a sick woman because of you!
I'm calling my lawyers.

29:28.091 --> 29:30.143
Call your lawyer! You're going to jail!
We're done here for now!

29:30.343 --> 29:32.936
You should've let me
kick his ass.

29:33.136 --> 29:35.105
I got a better idea.

29:37.608 --> 29:40.778
Any insight from Natalie's blood sample?
Yeah. Zombies.

29:40.978 --> 29:43.280
Excuse me?
Not-not real zombies.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.781
Obviously, those don't exist.

29:44.981 --> 29:46.742
Unless you're talking
about... zombie ants,

29:46.942 --> 29:48.744
but that's more of a,
like, a parasitic fungus.

29:48.944 --> 29:51.122
Has no bearing on this case...
I'll just wait

29:51.322 --> 29:53.833
for whatever this is to pass.

29:54.033 --> 29:55.125
Okay. It's done.
Thank you.

29:55.325 --> 29:56.794
Um, I found...

29:56.994 --> 29:58.962
scopolamine in Natalie's blood.

29:59.162 --> 30:00.964
It's a potent hypnotic

30:01.164 --> 30:04.635
that puts people in a state
of extreme suscepti... bility.

30:04.835 --> 30:06.637
Like zombies.
Yeah.

30:06.837 --> 30:08.972
Dylan Samuels could have
exerted influence over Natalie,

30:09.172 --> 30:11.476
or Candace, too, if she's
had it in her blood.

30:11.676 --> 30:12.644
Scopolamine is also consistent

30:12.844 --> 30:14.645
with the liver toxicity

30:14.845 --> 30:17.022
in Dr. Barnes's
old medical records.

30:17.222 --> 30:18.816
That's good work, Sebastian.

30:19.016 --> 30:20.652
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it means that Candace

30:20.852 --> 30:22.945
could have been driving the
SUV that killed Dr. Barnes

30:23.145 --> 30:24.154
and injured her own daughter.

30:24.354 --> 30:26.324
And she'd have no memory of it.

30:26.524 --> 30:27.991
Yeah, and there's no way
to prove that Dylan

30:28.191 --> 30:29.493
administered the
drug to Natalie,

30:29.693 --> 30:31.871
let alone Candace or Dr. Barnes.
No.

30:32.071 --> 30:34.164
But it's a start
in the right direction.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.167
<i>Mrs. Samuels</i>

30:37.367 --> 30:38.670
is under a psychiatric hold.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.005
No one has access to her
but her doctors.

30:41.205 --> 30:43.007
You can come back
after the 72 hours.

30:43.207 --> 30:44.342
Come on, just let...
Please.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.009
Don't make me call security.

30:46.209 --> 30:47.679
Thank you.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.223
We'll find another way,
I promise.

30:51.423 --> 30:52.892
What other way?
In 72 hours,

30:53.092 --> 30:54.852
Dylan Samuels is in the wind.

30:55.052 --> 30:56.980
Well, hold on a sec.
We'll call Hannah,

30:57.180 --> 30:59.022
give her an update.
All right. Okay.

30:59.222 --> 31:01.192
Hannah. Yeah, it's me.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.027
No, they're not letting us in.

31:03.227 --> 31:04.570
Yeah, Gregorio?
She's right here.

31:10.951 --> 31:13.288
Oh, crap.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.847
151.

31:42.482 --> 31:44.443
Tammy's not answering.

31:44.643 --> 31:48.155
Lasalle thinks she went into
the psych ward to find Candace.

31:48.355 --> 31:50.575
Well, maybe we should
give Gregorio a little rope.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.576
There's a chance
Candace'll give her something.

31:52.776 --> 31:54.578
Yeah, she's on a 72-hour hold.

31:54.778 --> 31:56.580
Even if she does,
it won't be admissible.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.165
Yeah, but it'll be a start.

31:58.365 --> 32:00.667
We have nothing concrete
on Dylan Samuels.

32:00.867 --> 32:03.503
Soon as he gets Candace's money,
he'll disappear.

32:03.703 --> 32:04.963
Yeah, he's good at that,
but he's not good enough

32:05.163 --> 32:06.548
that I can't find him.

32:06.748 --> 32:07.759
What do you got, Patton?

32:07.959 --> 32:09.594
Got another alias
on Dylan Samuels,

32:09.794 --> 32:13.931
aka William Flynn,
aka Roger Clark.

32:14.131 --> 32:15.223
And another wife?

32:15.423 --> 32:16.433
From 12 years ago.

32:16.633 --> 32:18.310
Hmm. Guessing
it ended poorly, too?

32:18.510 --> 32:21.439
She had a family trust fund,
a good job at a law firm

32:21.639 --> 32:22.773
in Arlington, Virginia.

32:22.973 --> 32:24.525
Once Dylan was done with her,

32:24.725 --> 32:26.903
she was broke,
unemployed and strung out.

32:27.103 --> 32:29.571
You find anything useful
that can help us take him down?

32:29.771 --> 32:31.281
His wife filed a police report
saying

32:31.481 --> 32:33.617
that he was spying on her
with a hidden camera.

32:33.817 --> 32:34.786
That got me to thinking.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.453
Could be using
the same M.O. here.

32:36.653 --> 32:38.288
Dylan has an account

32:38.488 --> 32:40.290
with a Web-based
security company.

32:40.490 --> 32:41.834
With a little Triple P magic,

32:42.034 --> 32:43.419
I found these.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.799
House and car completely wired.

32:48.999 --> 32:52.135
He can keep tabs on
Candace's every move.

32:52.335 --> 32:53.805
Not just Candace. Natalie, also.

32:54.005 --> 32:56.140
- He got her apartment and car.
- That's how

32:56.340 --> 32:59.018
Dylan found out Natalie was
gonna meet Sandra that night.

32:59.218 --> 33:01.604
If he's been watching 'em
this close,

33:01.804 --> 33:03.605
can't imagine he'd stop now.

33:16.201 --> 33:19.163
Told the other nurse
I don't want any more pills.

33:19.363 --> 33:21.332
I want to get clear.

33:21.532 --> 33:22.959
Candace,

33:23.159 --> 33:24.335
I'm Special Agent Gregorio.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.128
I met you at the hospital.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.589
Oh. Right.

33:29.789 --> 33:31.174
Sorry.

33:31.374 --> 33:33.344
The drugs make me forget things.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.346
Yeah?
And I'm...

33:35.546 --> 33:37.347
I'm in a fog all the time.

33:37.547 --> 33:38.766
Whatever you're
experiencing isn't

33:38.966 --> 33:41.018
from what the doctors
are giving you.

33:41.218 --> 33:43.270
Your husband's doing it.

33:43.470 --> 33:46.022
Dylan?

33:46.222 --> 33:47.525
No.

33:47.725 --> 33:50.653
It's the truth. What I'm
about to tell you is gonna be

33:50.853 --> 33:54.030
really hard for you to hear,
but you need to listen to me.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.200
Okay?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.746
Your husband's been
drugging you, manipulating you,

33:59.946 --> 34:02.038
making you feel
like you're losing your mind.

34:02.238 --> 34:04.208
Why would Dylan want to hurt me?

34:04.408 --> 34:06.251
Because he's after your money.

34:06.451 --> 34:08.210
He's a con man, Candace.

34:08.411 --> 34:11.047
Does this for a living by
destroying the women's lives

34:11.246 --> 34:12.300
that he's involved with.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.306
<i>Gregorio here.</i>

34:20.507 --> 34:21.893
Leave a message.

34:22.092 --> 34:23.603
Voice mail again.

34:23.803 --> 34:25.396
If Dylan is monitoring...

34:25.596 --> 34:27.231
He is. He's methodical.

34:27.431 --> 34:29.067
Not the kind
to leave things to chance.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.902
He'll need to know
what's happening in that room.

34:31.101 --> 34:33.320
The last thing he wants is
Gregorio talking to Candace.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.114
Should we have Lasalle
badge his way in?

34:35.313 --> 34:37.114
Not yet. If I can get a hold
of Gregorio,

34:37.315 --> 34:38.742
we might have a chance
of stopping Dylan.

34:40.869 --> 34:43.206
I was just so lonely
after my husband died,

34:43.406 --> 34:44.373
and Dylan filled the void.

34:44.572 --> 34:45.791
Yeah. You needed someone.

34:45.991 --> 34:47.751
And he took advantage of that.

34:47.951 --> 34:49.710
These guys... they're predators.

34:49.911 --> 34:51.422
But I'm a smart woman.

34:51.621 --> 34:52.922
At least, I thought I was.
No, no, no, no.

34:53.123 --> 34:54.425
You can't blame yourself.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.302
You wanted to believe.
We <i> all</i> do.

34:56.502 --> 34:58.096
I brought a monster
into my home,

34:58.296 --> 34:59.722
into Natalie's life,

34:59.922 --> 35:02.182
and she nearly died.
Listen, I've been there.

35:02.382 --> 35:03.976
The self-doubt, the guilt.

35:04.176 --> 35:07.146
God, I've made so
many bad decisions.

35:07.346 --> 35:10.398
But starting today,
you get to take your life back. Mm.

35:14.310 --> 35:16.447
Pride, I'm doing
what I have to do.

35:16.647 --> 35:19.617
This woman's in trouble, and
she needs someone to help her.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.409
No, no, I'm not just
gonna leave her here.

35:23.286 --> 35:26.958
Whatever. Write me up,
fire me, I don't give a crap.

35:27.158 --> 35:29.501
You're the hypocrite here.
You do this stuff all the time.

35:29.701 --> 35:32.255
Okay? We're done here.

35:32.455 --> 35:34.297
What's wrong?

35:34.497 --> 35:37.635
Listen, I got to get you out
of here. You good with that?

35:37.835 --> 35:40.637
Okay, just sit tight, and I'm
gonna go get a wheelchair, okay?

35:40.837 --> 35:41.806
All right.

35:49.521 --> 35:52.858
I can get a court order.
Well, then that's what you need to do.

35:53.943 --> 35:57.153
You're very persistent,
Special Agent Gregorio.

36:07.831 --> 36:09.041
Not sure what your plan is,

36:09.241 --> 36:11.043
but kidnapping a federal agent
isn't your smartest move.

36:11.243 --> 36:13.211
Don't talk.
Just curious.

36:13.411 --> 36:16.840
When you killed Sandra, were you
expecting Natalie to survive,

36:17.040 --> 36:18.509
or was that a screwup?

36:22.847 --> 36:26.099
You're not nearly as smart
as you think you are.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.855
Need you to tell me
everything NCIS has on me.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.898
We know you planted
the fentanyl in Sandra's car

36:33.098 --> 36:36.027
to make her look like a dealer,
and Natalie a customer.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.987
Sandra should have stayed out
of my business.

36:38.187 --> 36:39.864
You'd think she would've
learned after our marriage.

36:40.064 --> 36:41.199
I haven't even mentioned

36:41.399 --> 36:43.867
that you drove your current wife
crazy and framed her

36:44.067 --> 36:45.411
for murder.
Admit it.

36:45.611 --> 36:46.871
I'm impressive.

36:47.071 --> 36:48.371
You're sick.

36:48.571 --> 36:50.206
And you're just my type.

36:50.406 --> 36:52.210
Pretends to be strong,

36:52.410 --> 36:54.210
but broken
in 15 different places.

36:54.410 --> 36:55.838
Hmm.
Who hurt you?

36:56.038 --> 36:57.590
Screw you.
Daddy?

36:57.790 --> 36:59.215
Hmm.
No.

36:59.415 --> 37:01.552
He was probably just distant,

37:01.752 --> 37:03.387
so you went searching
for a replacement?

37:03.587 --> 37:05.431
Why don't you come back
over here and say that?

37:05.631 --> 37:08.224
Yeah, I would have had fun
with you.

37:08.424 --> 37:09.936
No, I'd take you apart
piece by piece.

37:10.136 --> 37:11.896
You don't scare me
with that gun.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.563
You really have no idea
what's about to happen here.

37:13.763 --> 37:15.231
Do you?
You're not gonna shoot me.

37:15.431 --> 37:17.568
You didn't even have the balls
to kill Sandra.

37:17.768 --> 37:20.070
You had to drug Candace
to make her do it.

37:20.270 --> 37:21.905
You think she was in any
condition to drive that night?

37:22.105 --> 37:22.907
I had Candace

37:23.107 --> 37:24.407
drive by the camera.

37:24.607 --> 37:26.577
Then <i> I</i> did the real work myself.

37:26.777 --> 37:29.246
You killed Sandra Barnes?

37:29.446 --> 37:30.706
She didn't leave me any choice.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.251
Turn around.

37:34.451 --> 37:36.003
Turn around!

37:36.203 --> 37:38.422
You're under arrest
for the murder of Sandra Barnes.

37:38.622 --> 37:40.090
I'd put that gun down.

37:40.290 --> 37:42.092
And how you gonna pull that off?

37:42.292 --> 37:44.344
Not me. My team.

37:46.429 --> 37:48.974
For a con man,
you're an easy mark.

37:50.893 --> 37:53.603
You see, because...

37:53.803 --> 37:55.606
you confessed,

37:55.806 --> 37:57.942
and we got it all,
so you're done.

37:58.142 --> 38:00.110
What?
Drop the weapon, Samuels!

38:01.612 --> 38:03.489
Try something.

38:04.614 --> 38:06.157
Please do.

38:14.541 --> 38:15.960
You okay?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.335
Yeah.

38:17.535 --> 38:19.005
Thanks for coming up with a plan

38:19.205 --> 38:21.047
and saving my ass, man.
Oh, God.

38:21.247 --> 38:22.675
You were a little harsh
on the phone.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.135
Had to sell it, right?

38:24.335 --> 38:26.971
Well, don't think
you gave us much choice,

38:27.171 --> 38:29.139
really, going rogue like that.

38:29.339 --> 38:30.807
Well, it worked out, didn't it?

38:31.007 --> 38:32.143
Well, next time...

38:32.343 --> 38:35.228
Let's not have a next time.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.277
Oh.

38:41.477 --> 38:42.987
Mom?

38:43.187 --> 38:44.487
Oh, honey!
Hi.

38:44.687 --> 38:46.239
Oh.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.827
She's not in trouble?

38:51.027 --> 38:54.164
No, ma'am. Real killer's on
his way to jail as we speak.

38:54.364 --> 38:56.041
He won't be
bothering you anymore.

38:56.241 --> 39:00.211
Special Agent Gregorio,
I can't thank you enough.

39:00.411 --> 39:02.505
Tammy.
Don't worry about it.

39:02.705 --> 39:05.675
I'm just embarrassed
that I was taken in so easily.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.385
No.

39:07.585 --> 39:10.347
I mean, it's gonna take you
a while to get past it,

39:10.547 --> 39:14.143
trust again, but having people
that care about you helps.

39:16.519 --> 39:19.398
You're talking
about me, aren't you?

39:19.598 --> 39:21.442
Shut up.

39:28.189 --> 39:29.699
You're gonna be glad
you gave me the green light.

39:29.899 --> 39:31.702
My contact came through.
Great.

39:33.369 --> 39:35.373
I'm not here
to give you a hard time.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.664
No? Then what?

39:36.864 --> 39:38.250
You're right.

39:38.450 --> 39:42.338
We can't hide from Apollyon.

39:42.538 --> 39:45.215
I can't protect you
by keeping you in the dark.

39:45.415 --> 39:48.135
But you can't keep me
in the dark, either.

39:48.335 --> 39:50.054
I don't like having
either one of you involved.

39:50.254 --> 39:51.347
But if we're gonna do this,

39:51.547 --> 39:53.431
we do it together.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.268
Fair enough.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.190
So, you connected
with your source?

40:02.358 --> 40:04.360
Luka Osman,

40:04.560 --> 40:06.070
former Turkish intelligence.

40:06.270 --> 40:07.362
Currently a black marketeer.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.449
Can he be trusted?

40:10.649 --> 40:12.242
I mean, as much
as any source can.

40:12.442 --> 40:14.369
He ran point for us on a
couple of joint operations,

40:14.569 --> 40:15.704
and his intel always bore out.

40:15.904 --> 40:19.083
Plus, I, uh... saved
his life once, so...

40:19.283 --> 40:20.458
He knows where Avery Walker is?

40:20.658 --> 40:22.753
The reason the task force
can't find Walker

40:22.953 --> 40:24.255
is 'cause he never stops moving.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.965
Every time
they pinpoint his location...

40:26.165 --> 40:27.257
He's gone again.

40:27.457 --> 40:29.425
So, Luka doesn't
know where Walker is.

40:29.625 --> 40:32.721
He's got a fairly good idea
of where he's going to be.

40:32.921 --> 40:34.806
That means the task force
can get there first.

40:35.006 --> 40:38.853
And we can finally put an end
to Apollyon once and for all.
