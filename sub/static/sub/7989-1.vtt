00:13.765 --> 00:16.232
I always wanted
to be a good cop...

00:18.536 --> 00:21.371
But there's no straight line
to that.

00:21.373 --> 00:22.705
I always told myself

00:22.707 --> 00:25.375
That the end would justify
the means...

00:29.848 --> 00:33.950
But now that i'm at the end,

00:33.952 --> 00:36.052
I can't justify anything.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.592
It happened so slowly,
I didn't realize,

00:42.594 --> 00:45.495
And so quickly,
i never saw it coming.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.777
They're bisexual,
you know.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.512
- Who?
- Lilies.

01:02.514 --> 01:05.515
Each flower's both boy and girl,
a self-contained aberration.

01:05.516 --> 01:07.350
Self-contained aberr--
what you're saying,

01:07.352 --> 01:10.153
Every neighborhood in the
precinct is its own ecosystem?

01:10.155 --> 01:13.956
No, i'm saying
they screw themselves.

01:13.958 --> 01:15.992
Miss ortiz says she saw
some suspicious activity

01:15.994 --> 01:17.927
In and out of a fourth floor
apartment.

01:17.929 --> 01:19.662
Okay, what, drug activity?

01:19.664 --> 01:21.531
19-year-old od'd
from a hot dose

01:21.533 --> 01:23.332
He picked up from a renegade
in this area.

01:23.334 --> 01:24.934
A renegade drug dealer?

01:26.271 --> 01:27.804
Anyone cliqued up
with a local crew

01:27.806 --> 01:30.073
Knows that we cleaned out
this block.

01:30.075 --> 01:31.774
Right, right.

01:31.776 --> 01:33.876
H.

01:37.182 --> 01:39.182
Wait here.

01:40.618 --> 01:42.985
<i>Hola, princesa.</i>

01:42.987 --> 01:44.620
What a pretty scooter.

01:44.622 --> 01:46.956
Did you pick those streamers
yourself?

01:46.958 --> 01:48.758
I need you to do me a favor.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.994
Can you turn around and ride
back into your apartment

01:51.996 --> 01:53.696
And shut the door?

01:53.698 --> 01:55.665
Let me see how fast you can go.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.300
<i>RÃ¡pido, rÃ¡pido.</i>

02:02.340 --> 02:03.806
Police!

02:03.808 --> 02:05.007
Loman, no!

02:11.950 --> 02:13.850
Loman,
you see anyone else?

02:13.852 --> 02:15.318
How many suspects?

02:18.256 --> 02:19.255
Loman?

02:26.564 --> 02:27.563
Loman!

02:30.435 --> 02:33.069
<i>You're dead.</i>
<i>You're dead. You're dead.</i>

02:33.071 --> 02:35.571
A video game?

02:35.573 --> 02:37.807
I thought it was--
i mean, he just turned.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.475
I just--

02:39.477 --> 02:41.344
Did he reach for something?

02:43.081 --> 02:44.881
Loman, focus.

02:44.883 --> 02:47.049
Did he make
an aggressive gesture?

02:47.051 --> 02:48.985
No, he just...

02:48.987 --> 02:50.353
Stood up.

02:50.355 --> 02:51.754
He pulled a gun.

02:51.756 --> 02:53.623
No, no gun.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.391
It was a video game.

02:55.393 --> 02:58.561
Where there's drugs,
there's a gun.

03:03.301 --> 03:04.700
His drink is still fizzy.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.138
I mean, the game must have been
paused when we did the--

03:09.140 --> 03:11.741
They'll understand that, right?

03:11.743 --> 03:14.443
I--internal affairs?

03:14.445 --> 03:17.046
We knocked,
identified ourselves

03:17.048 --> 03:18.514
As the suspect
fired a shot through the door.

03:18.516 --> 03:19.815
Harlee, i heard shots.
They sounded real.

03:19.817 --> 03:21.317
You heard them, too, right?

03:21.319 --> 03:25.254
I'll protect you,
but you got to trust me,

03:25.256 --> 03:27.957
And you have to do
exactly as i say.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.525
Take a step to the right.

03:31.729 --> 03:33.262
I kicked it in.

03:33.264 --> 03:36.132
You were first through,
squeezed off two rounds...

03:37.936 --> 03:40.136
As the suspect
fired a second shot.

03:40.138 --> 03:41.604
He shot twice?

03:41.606 --> 03:42.572
Yes.

03:48.546 --> 03:52.415
Breathe, loman, breathe.

03:52.417 --> 03:55.851
Breathe, breathe.

03:58.389 --> 04:01.257
The truth is in the paperwork.

04:02.094 --> 04:06.166
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans

04:08.333 --> 04:10.800
The rookie should go
buy himself a lottery ticket.

04:10.802 --> 04:12.034
I mean, what are the odds
he would earn a notch

04:12.036 --> 04:13.903
On his second day?
Come on.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.137
Let me tell you, i had this
kid the entire shift yesterday.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.540
He didn't strike me
as a gunslinger.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.377
I don't trust rookies
or cowboys.

04:21.379 --> 04:23.012
Or facebook or your husband.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.981
And i'm right about all four.

04:24.983 --> 04:26.649
Tell me the son of a bitch
won't have any use

04:26.651 --> 04:27.650
For that ambulance.

04:27.652 --> 04:28.851
Coroner's en route.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.386
Rookie took a slug to the vest,

04:30.388 --> 04:34.390
But managed
to put the dealer down.

04:34.392 --> 04:35.825
Is harlee inside?

04:35.827 --> 04:37.393
Yeah, she's fine,
not a scratch.

04:39.564 --> 04:40.930
How we doing?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.365
Are you okay?

04:46.337 --> 04:47.737
Name's jamarr malcolm.

04:47.739 --> 04:49.572
He runs with the northside crew
until recently.

04:49.574 --> 04:52.541
They claim he's independent now.
Every corpse is.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.145
He had some kind of connect,
sizable stash, cut and bagged.

04:56.147 --> 04:58.414
Where's our girl?
In there.

04:58.416 --> 04:59.548
Socks and sandals?

04:59.550 --> 05:01.083
Yeah, they funky as hell,
right?

05:01.085 --> 05:03.085
When i told you
to show the kid the ropes,

05:03.087 --> 05:06.022
I assumed you'd work
your way into shootouts.

05:06.024 --> 05:07.623
Never thought much
of training wheels.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.192
That's because you
never needed them.

05:10.194 --> 05:13.029
There might have been a second
man out the bedroom window.

05:13.031 --> 05:14.430
Did you get a look?

05:14.432 --> 05:17.199
White boy,
blue tank, yellow sneakers.

05:17.201 --> 05:18.501
Did he have a bag on him?

05:18.503 --> 05:19.535
Not that i saw.

05:19.537 --> 05:21.304
Stash is in
the living room.

05:21.306 --> 05:23.105
Yeah, well,
hopefully that's all there is.

05:23.107 --> 05:26.842
I'll have the boys
look into known associates.

05:26.844 --> 05:28.911
You need anything from me?

05:28.913 --> 05:30.313
I always need you, woz.

05:30.315 --> 05:32.515
Harlee, i'm asking.

05:32.517 --> 05:33.849
Are we good?

05:36.454 --> 05:38.721
How much do
you want to know?

05:38.723 --> 05:40.256
How much do
i need to know?

05:42.226 --> 05:44.327
We're solid.
All right.

05:44.329 --> 05:45.828
I'll lob a call in
to internal affairs,

05:45.830 --> 05:47.363
See if they can interview
you and loman

05:47.365 --> 05:48.597
Tomorrow at the precinct.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.166
Okay.

05:50.168 --> 05:53.002
We're on ice tonight
at murphy's, all right?

05:53.004 --> 05:54.937
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off,

05:54.939 --> 05:57.006
Hold the kid's hand
for a little bit.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.274
All right.

06:01.079 --> 06:02.311
<i>A bullet penetrated the door.</i>

06:02.313 --> 06:04.080
Officer santos kicked it in,

06:04.082 --> 06:06.082
And the suspect made
an aggressive gesture after--

06:06.084 --> 06:08.584
No, shooting the door
was the aggressive gesture.

06:08.586 --> 06:09.719
Right.

06:09.721 --> 06:11.821
We took fire.
You were first to enter,

06:11.823 --> 06:14.757
Engaging the assailant
and shooting him in the chest

06:14.759 --> 06:18.394
As he returned fire,
shooting you in the vest.

06:19.931 --> 06:23.265
Why didn't you tell me
about the second bullet?

06:24.736 --> 06:27.903
Because you would
have flinched,

06:27.905 --> 06:29.572
And i'm not that good a shot.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.544
That's my daughter's car.

06:41.119 --> 06:42.551
Write it down.

06:42.553 --> 06:44.653
"engaged the assailant,
shooting him in the chest

06:44.655 --> 06:46.589
As he returned fire."

06:49.961 --> 06:51.260
Cristina.

06:51.262 --> 06:52.828
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

06:54.232 --> 06:57.767
Ma, come on, again?
We talked about this.

06:57.769 --> 06:59.268
I got you that car

06:59.270 --> 07:01.370
So you don't have
to lug your cello on the subway

07:01.372 --> 07:04.540
In the dark,
not to ditch school after lunch.

07:04.542 --> 07:07.810
Officer,
i was getting a frappucino.

07:07.812 --> 07:09.779
You cannot keep
swooping over like this.

07:09.781 --> 07:12.348
I just came by to tell you
i have an extended shift.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.315
What, are you okay?

07:13.317 --> 07:15.484
Did something happen?

07:15.486 --> 07:17.686
Rough day.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.922
Better now
that I get to see my baby.

07:23.995 --> 07:25.728
Okay, mom,
i got to get to class.

07:25.730 --> 07:27.229
Okay.

07:27.231 --> 07:29.432
Look, pick up
something to eat, okay?

07:29.434 --> 07:31.634
I shouldn't be too late.

07:31.636 --> 07:33.502
You have a date?

07:33.504 --> 07:36.005
No, a work thing.

07:36.007 --> 07:37.306
God, it's not that boxer,
is it?

07:37.308 --> 07:39.008
I'm not dating anyone.

07:58.196 --> 07:59.628
That all you got?

08:07.071 --> 08:09.071
You're pretty.
That's the problem.

08:21.586 --> 08:22.885
Hey, how about another date?

08:22.887 --> 08:24.954
This wasn't a date.
Mm.

08:46.310 --> 08:47.643
Don't be dicks.

08:47.645 --> 08:49.445
It's your happy
you're not dead day!

08:49.447 --> 08:50.946
Oh, is that why
we were clapping?

08:50.948 --> 08:52.348
I thought it was
'cause she finally showed up.

08:52.350 --> 08:53.649
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

08:53.651 --> 08:55.150
Any chance
my gift is the last parka?

08:55.152 --> 08:56.785
Who took my parka?
Oh, here, here, here.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.255
That wet hair, i'd say
you already got your gift.

08:59.257 --> 09:02.157
Remind me, sap, is your vow
of chastity self-imposed

09:02.159 --> 09:03.759
Or one of the rules
at your mommy's house?

09:03.761 --> 09:05.294
All right,
hey, hey, all right,

09:05.296 --> 09:06.762
Are we gonna circle jerk,
or did someone collect?

09:06.764 --> 09:08.664
Let's go.
$1,200 apiece.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.699
Koreans on fulton still owe.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.301
So does big chuckie

09:12.303 --> 09:14.470
And the escort who works
out of the foot massage place.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.605
And the boutique off bedford
is cash strapped,

09:16.607 --> 09:18.073
Gave us merchandise
to hold us over.

09:18.075 --> 09:20.576
Look at this,
alice and olivia, hmm?

09:20.578 --> 09:22.177
What size?
Zero.

09:22.179 --> 09:23.512
You want me to get
a shoehorn?

09:23.514 --> 09:25.381
I'm thinking
about for cristina.

09:25.383 --> 09:27.416
All right, sold.
Bring the rest to raj.

09:27.418 --> 09:28.918
He's good for 30Â¢ on the dollar.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.586
Harlee, there's a--

09:30.588 --> 09:32.988
There's a new bookie
working out of the food trucks

09:32.990 --> 09:34.957
On bay ridge.

09:34.959 --> 09:38.894
Name is hame, hime, ham--

09:38.896 --> 09:39.962
Haim.

09:39.964 --> 09:41.297
Think phlegm.

09:41.299 --> 09:42.498
Haim, whatever.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.300
He checks out.
He's good, okay?

09:44.302 --> 09:45.935
You meet him,
you collect,

09:45.937 --> 09:48.037
And then you give him
the rundown, all right?

09:48.039 --> 09:50.573
Now on to some
real police work.

09:50.575 --> 09:52.942
Did the tox screen come back
on our shooter's heroin?

09:52.944 --> 09:54.777
The lab promises bright
and early.

09:54.779 --> 09:56.579
We got a few names
that could be harlee's runner

09:56.581 --> 09:59.148
With yellow sneakers, none
with a permanent address though.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.383
All right, well, he's working
out of our drug-free zone,

10:01.385 --> 10:02.384
So he's not gonna be
in the book.

10:02.386 --> 10:03.786
I want this guy.

10:03.788 --> 10:05.454
Come on, saperstein,
i'm 50 short.

10:05.456 --> 10:07.590
How hard is it to divide by six?
You owe me ten bucks each.

10:07.592 --> 10:08.924
Let's go, come on, pony up.

10:08.926 --> 10:10.159
Did you hear that?
You hear that?

10:10.161 --> 10:11.527
Espada just bought us
all a round.

10:11.529 --> 10:12.928
Why am i always the one
getting shorted?

10:12.930 --> 10:14.563
You ain't the one--
waa.

10:14.565 --> 10:16.465
How hard is it to divide
by six, though, for real?

10:16.467 --> 10:18.067
No, no, no,
all i'm saying is my husband

10:18.069 --> 10:19.468
Is texting like a teenage girl.

10:19.470 --> 10:20.970
Still doesn't mean
he's doing one.

10:20.972 --> 10:22.605
But, you know,
he bought a gym membership

10:22.607 --> 10:23.872
That we cannot afford.

10:23.874 --> 10:24.974
So what?
He's working out.

10:24.976 --> 10:26.408
You want him healthy, right?

10:26.410 --> 10:27.776
No.

10:27.778 --> 10:29.378
Where you going?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.347
I got that internal affairs
tomorrow, remember?

10:31.349 --> 10:32.448
So what?

10:32.450 --> 10:34.817
Joe's a stand-up guy, tess...

10:36.554 --> 10:38.354
But if you
want a little insurance,

10:38.356 --> 10:40.756
A little nut massage
never hurt anybody.

10:43.394 --> 10:44.893
Good night.
Thank you very much.

10:54.705 --> 10:56.772
One more for the road?

10:56.774 --> 10:58.374
Bruce, you got change
of a hundred?

11:02.113 --> 11:04.913
You guys are having fun.
What are you celebrating?

11:04.915 --> 11:07.916
Surviving the day.
Huh.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.619
Well, with you, i'd be happy
to survive the night.

11:10.621 --> 11:11.954
Let me save you some time.

11:11.956 --> 11:13.622
I don't do witty banter,

11:13.624 --> 11:17.059
And chances are your follow-up
to that won't impress me.

11:17.061 --> 11:19.528
I'm a risk/reward
kind of guy.

11:19.530 --> 11:20.963
Sure took a risk
with that tie.

11:23.668 --> 11:25.000
I hate to break it to you,

11:25.002 --> 11:27.336
But i think that counts
as witty banter.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.874
Here you go.
Thank you.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.153
Need something, loman?

11:44.155 --> 11:46.855
He coached kids baseball.

11:46.857 --> 11:48.057
Who?

11:50.494 --> 11:52.294
The man i killed.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.497
He also carried a bag full of
heroin with a loaded .45 in it.

11:57.268 --> 12:00.069
It's not right.

12:00.071 --> 12:01.103
Come on, let's go.

12:06.644 --> 12:07.710
I shouldn't have
done it.

12:07.712 --> 12:09.144
I got to make this right.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.714
There is no "i" anymore.

12:11.716 --> 12:13.549
There's only "we,"
and we have a plan.

12:13.551 --> 12:14.983
You remember that plan?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.985
Look, i'll tell them
that i put the gun in his hand.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.520
That way you don't have
to be a part of this.

12:18.522 --> 12:19.788
Knock it off.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.356
You're not doing this.

12:21.358 --> 12:23.225
I don't want to be
this kind of cop.

12:23.227 --> 12:25.794
None of us
are that kind of cop.

12:25.796 --> 12:27.229
I have a daughter, okay?

12:27.231 --> 12:28.564
Which means you have a daughter

12:28.566 --> 12:30.199
Because that badge
in your pocket,

12:30.201 --> 12:31.867
That makes us family,

12:31.869 --> 12:33.736
And we love that daughter.

12:33.738 --> 12:37.239
That daughter is beautiful
and smart and talented,

12:37.241 --> 12:39.675
And she needs us,

12:39.677 --> 12:43.679
And that's how this works from
now on until death do us part.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.249
I saved your ass today,
which means tomorrow

12:47.251 --> 12:49.852
In that internal affairs
interview, you save mine.

12:57.561 --> 12:59.661
Look.

12:59.663 --> 13:01.096
Look.

13:01.098 --> 13:02.898
Listen to me.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.301
Kicking in a door
after hearing gunshots,

13:06.303 --> 13:10.305
Throwing yourself
on the line,

13:10.307 --> 13:12.174
Baby, that's hardcore
hero stuff.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.011
A hero who made a mistake.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.718
I got you here.

13:25.022 --> 13:27.356
I got you,

13:27.358 --> 13:28.757
And you got me.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.926
"we took fire.
I kicked in the door."

13:48.928 --> 13:50.895
Mom, i love it.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.230
It is so perfect.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.631
That much practice,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.300
You deserve to look
your best onstage.

13:55.303 --> 13:56.434
Thank you so much.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.103
Okay, which one for me?

13:59.105 --> 14:01.239
Mm, what kind of look
are we going for?

14:01.241 --> 14:02.240
Wholesome and honest.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.474
Get a new wardrobe.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.745
I'll wear the black.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.315
Hey, so you can get there
at curtain.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.650
Mr. Lewis said i could tape off
a few seats.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.353
I thought students
weren't allowed to save seats.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.855
Soloists are.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.357
Soloist?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.861
You have a solo tonight?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.096
Only the bach concerto.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.664
What?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.800
I was gonna try and surprise
you, but i suck at secrets.

14:28.803 --> 14:31.269
Oh, my god.
I'm front row center?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.538
Are you ki--
mom, you're smearing.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.207
Oh, my goodness.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.311
Oh, this came
from the treasurer's office.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.549
Everything okay with tuition?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.951
Yeah, i took care
of it last week.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.319
The concerto, really?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.620
I got to get gas.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.022
- So i'll see you tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.591
Cristina.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.295
I love you too.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.232
<i>When's it due?</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:02.500
Two months ago.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.102
The school's sending notes home.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.470
You know, i knew
it was gonna be expensive,

15:05.472 --> 15:06.471
But she's doing so good.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.705
Got the solo tonight.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.240
So you pay me back
next month.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.043
I won't have it next month
or the month after.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.145
Cristina's doing well
in this school, isn't she?

15:14.147 --> 15:17.181
Honor roll?
I'm ten grand short, woz.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.250
Our extracurricular
barely covers--

15:19.252 --> 15:20.486
You'll have it.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.719
I'm working on something.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.488
I can't get into the specifics,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.957
But it's juilliard-type money.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.560
You'll have it, don't worry.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.295
Hey, tox screen
on our shooter's heroin.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.563
Jamarr was an amateur.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.966
Cut the stuff
with a synthetic opiate.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.535
Makes it hyper potent,
like a easy pass to an overdose.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.771
And if our runner has this
poison and it hits the streets--

15:39.773 --> 15:42.207
I want this guy picked up now.

15:46.312 --> 15:47.612
Donnie pomp?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.481
As far as internal affairs
goes, you could do worse.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.716
And you lent him your office?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.518
Home field advantage.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.264
The assailant
was later pronounced dead

16:06.266 --> 16:07.632
By responding paramedics.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.111
What do you squat, harlee?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.845
Squat?
Unassisted.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.146
I've seen you at the gym.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.347
What are you looking for,

16:23.349 --> 16:25.149
A chance to brag
about your numbers?

16:27.053 --> 16:28.986
<i>I'm wondering why you</i>
<i>didn't let detective loman</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:30.388
<i>Kick the door in?</i>

16:30.390 --> 16:32.457
<i>I mean, he's got</i>
<i>a decent frame on him,</i>

16:32.459 --> 16:34.058
And then you,
as a more seasoned officer,

16:34.060 --> 16:35.293
Could have been
the first one through.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.594
Well, a bullet
had just ripped past me,

16:36.596 --> 16:38.130
And i was in position.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.464
<i>With your weapon drawn?</i>

16:39.466 --> 16:40.998
<i>Why don't we skip the dance</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:43.468
<i>And you ask your real question, lieutenant?</i>

16:44.938 --> 16:46.871
A rookie from your unit
rushes in,

16:46.873 --> 16:49.307
Opens fire,
gets hit in return.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.309
All the while,
you never discharge your weapon.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.244
Like i said,

16:53.246 --> 16:54.645
As i entered,
i took an averted step

16:54.647 --> 16:56.147
Around detective loman

16:56.149 --> 16:58.549
And saw that the assailant
had been neutralized.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.017
With a sig 45
in his right hand?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.119
- Correct.
- That's interesting.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.621
Try being there.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.924
No, no, it's just
i have a prior arrest record

17:06.925 --> 17:08.125
On your now-deceased shooter

17:08.127 --> 17:10.728
That describes him
as being left-handed.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.069
Can you explain that?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.476
Well, either
he was ambidextrous

17:25.478 --> 17:26.978
Or broke his left hand,

17:26.980 --> 17:30.181
Or a copper flat-out
confused him with another perp

17:30.183 --> 17:32.284
Because this assailant
shot detective loman

17:32.285 --> 17:34.118
With his right hand.

17:37.891 --> 17:38.923
Nah, i'm messing with you.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.258
He wasn't a lefty.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.325
I couldn't resist.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.929
You should try harder.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.636
Ten minutes earlier,
we would have walked in on it.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.604
We came to question the girl
about her boyfriend,

17:53.606 --> 17:54.872
Found her beaten unconscious.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.707
Looks like raul mendez's crew.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.611
The boyfriend
was on the fridge.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.412
What's so interesting
about the boyfriend?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.348
Earl barlow, been hanging
with loman's dead shooter,

18:04.350 --> 18:06.250
On our short list
of known associates,

18:06.252 --> 18:08.019
Seen wearing yellow shoes.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.488
Well, i guess someone else
has the same list.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.624
We know raul's not a fan
of unsanctioned competition.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.526
Okay. Thanks.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.101
Sorry to interrupt.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.636
- Lieutenant, can i have a second?
- Yeah, come on in.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.737
We're done.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.039
Out of your hair
in a minute.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.840
No, that's okay.
Take your time.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.778
Okay, so that's him, the guy i
saw out the window, earl barlow.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.180
Sap and tufo traced him back
to his girlfriend's place.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.649
She give him up?
No, unconscious.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.051
She took a beating.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.053
Witness put
on raul mendez's crew.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.321
Son of a bitch.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.056
I'll take care of raul.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.459
Go sign up that bookie, haim
or ham or whatever it is.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.928
He called again.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.063
You're sending loman
back to the field?

18:52.065 --> 18:53.332
It's a clean shoot.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.333
Internal affairs
cleared you both.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.934
Woz...

18:59.739 --> 19:01.105
It wasn't a clean shoot.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.341
You don't say.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.742
I took care of it.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.444
All donnie got from me
was a closed file.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.280
No, what he got is a file
that he didn't want to touch.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.915
If he cleared us,
what's the difference?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.284
The difference is
you blinked.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.818
Tell me i didn't see
you blink up there.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.252
Look, the brass
pushes this newbie on us.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.454
You tell me to ride with him.
I ride with him.

19:16.457 --> 19:17.622
I don't need
to hear the details.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.856
I tell him to wait
at the door--

19:18.858 --> 19:20.224
I don't need
to hear the details!

19:20.226 --> 19:21.525
Then why are you
punching me on this?

19:21.527 --> 19:23.127
You want to save a pup
from drowning.

19:23.130 --> 19:24.495
I appreciate the instinct.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.630
I admire it.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.332
Maybe we even use the kid
someday,

19:27.333 --> 19:29.133
But never risk
a hole in my boat

19:29.135 --> 19:31.303
Unless you're positive
you can plug it.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.903
Loman's not ready
to get back out there.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.071
I'm not even sure
he wants--

19:34.073 --> 19:35.272
Just--just leave
the rookie to me.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.508
He's one of us now.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.311
Harlee, don't get wobbly.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.780
One slip at the wrong time,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.282
And we all go tumbling down,

19:45.284 --> 19:47.518
And i don't tumble well.

19:58.264 --> 20:01.365
<i>This was my father's trade.</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:05.303
<i>He taught me</i>
<i>it was a sacred profession.</i>

20:05.304 --> 20:08.406
Clearly an honorable front.

20:08.409 --> 20:10.875
Do you know why people
keep the ashes?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.510
So they don't forget.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.978
A reminder.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.147
I need to remind you
about our understanding, raul?

20:16.149 --> 20:18.382
Oh, I remember.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.752
You wanted to protect parks
and schools from the drug trade.

20:21.755 --> 20:23.788
I trusted your assurance

20:23.790 --> 20:26.157
That no one else
will push into that territory.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.292
This isn't about your turf.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.294
The dope's cut hot.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.996
I need to get it
all off the street.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.998
You cracked the skull
of my only lead.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.901
I don't think you're
appreciating my situation.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.903
I can't look like a bitch.

20:38.905 --> 20:43.574
You don't dispense
street justice in my precinct.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.943
Now, where is he?

20:45.945 --> 20:48.612
The girlfriend never
gave him up.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.448
Tough girl.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.850
Don't worry,
i'll find him.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.186
No more mayhem, raul.

20:55.188 --> 20:58.589
We both want what's best
for the community, lieutenant.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.725
I think you know
what that's going to take.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.562
Let me explain to you
how this works.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.167
I tolerate you because you
keep your business contained

21:10.169 --> 21:12.803
And you don't cause me
any aggravation.

21:12.805 --> 21:17.074
We both know that
if i burned you down tonight,

21:17.076 --> 21:20.544
Some punk phoenix
would rise from your ashes,

21:20.546 --> 21:23.280
And i'm already
starting to like him better.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.185
How's that for a reminder?

21:35.962 --> 21:36.961
Ground rules are simple.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.429
No dog fights, no cock fights,

21:38.431 --> 21:39.430
Absolutely no minors.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.798
You stick to the payments, haim,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.433
And we shouldn't have
any problems.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.034
What kind of payments?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.537
15% should take care
of any external threats.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.005
And vice?

21:48.007 --> 21:49.640
Best we can do there
is give you a heads-up

21:49.642 --> 21:50.708
If they're looking at you.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.310
Vice is half my problem.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.112
Half the problem, half the fee.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.947
Look, you pay to play.
We don't negotiate.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.284
15 against a grand gets you
in the game, end of story.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.119
You in?

22:02.121 --> 22:03.654
You like chicken shawarma?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.457
I've never been a fan.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.197
I'm willing
to give it another try.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.602
Get on the ground.

22:18.604 --> 22:19.870
You're under arrest for
attempted bribery

22:19.872 --> 22:21.872
Of a police officer.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.009
Police, nypd.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.083
Fbi, darling.
Nice try.

22:34.688 --> 22:35.886
Lower the weapon,
detective santos.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.521
It's you who's under arrest.

23:05.459 --> 23:08.528
What, no witty banter?

23:08.530 --> 23:10.463
You're the tie from the bar.

23:10.465 --> 23:14.467
Special agent stahl,
anti-corruption task force.

23:14.469 --> 23:17.336
You can go ahead
and take a peek at those.

23:17.338 --> 23:19.605
We've been following
you for over a month.

23:22.143 --> 23:24.644
Street-level cop taking
tribute in brooklyn,

23:24.646 --> 23:25.812
That'll win you a medal.

23:25.814 --> 23:27.513
Not so much,

23:27.515 --> 23:30.483
But it will win you
eight to ten years.

23:30.485 --> 23:33.619
Provided your cooperation
leads to convictions,

23:33.621 --> 23:35.555
We'll grant you full immunity,

23:35.557 --> 23:37.657
Even recommend
that you keep your pension.

23:37.659 --> 23:40.026
Want to throw in a little
something to sweeten the pot?

23:40.028 --> 23:43.296
Say, my self respect?

23:43.298 --> 23:45.565
Something i can use
to buy back my soul?

23:45.567 --> 23:46.966
Well, there is
the other option.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.701
How do you like jumpsuits?

23:48.703 --> 23:51.871
You have no idea
what it takes to be a good cop.

23:51.873 --> 23:54.574
Does every cop walk
into a jersey casino last month

23:54.576 --> 23:58.110
And cash in $50,000 in chips?

24:00.882 --> 24:02.048
You don't get it.

24:02.050 --> 24:05.351
Violent crime is down,

24:05.353 --> 24:06.853
Drugs and gangs away
from schools

24:06.855 --> 24:08.754
Because of this unit,
because of wozniak.

24:08.756 --> 24:12.091
A good cop might conclude that
wozniak's been taking payoffs

24:12.093 --> 24:13.559
And laundered money.

24:13.561 --> 24:16.863
Go after cops who are tearing
communities apart,

24:16.865 --> 24:18.865
Not the ones who are trying
to hold them together.

24:18.867 --> 24:21.334
Corruption is corruption,
detective.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.568
Your boss is making moves.

24:27.075 --> 24:28.741
Speak of the devil.

24:31.746 --> 24:33.512
You want me to answer it?

24:33.514 --> 24:35.248
Consider it an audition.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.721
<i>Harlee, where are you?</i>

24:41.723 --> 24:44.023
I couldn't make the deal
with the bookie.

24:44.025 --> 24:46.692
He wanted too many guarantees.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.928
<i>I can't pronounce</i>
<i>the guy's name anyhow.</i>

24:48.930 --> 24:52.865
I just left the mortuary.
Raul's standing down.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.134
<i>Look, the crew's gonna be</i>
<i>hitting the streets, all right?</i>

24:55.136 --> 24:57.904
<i>We're gonna find out if this</i>
<i>earl idiot is still dealing.</i>

24:57.906 --> 24:59.739
<i>I need you to be there.</i>
<i>Can you give me an hour?</i>

24:59.741 --> 25:02.742
I can't.

25:02.744 --> 25:03.910
Cristina's car got hit.

25:03.912 --> 25:05.311
What?
What happened?

25:05.313 --> 25:07.313
Is she okay?
<i>- Yeah, no, she's fine.</i>

25:09.317 --> 25:12.952
Her friend borrowed it
and smashed in the front end.

25:12.954 --> 25:14.487
<i>All right, well--</i>
<i>well, what the hell</i>

25:14.489 --> 25:16.088
<i>Are you talking to me for?</i>

25:16.090 --> 25:18.291
<i>Go take care of her.</i>
<i>Tell her I love her.</i>

25:20.962 --> 25:23.329
That wasn't so hard.

25:23.331 --> 25:24.897
Look, if you planned
this whole thing

25:24.899 --> 25:28.067
Thinking i was gonna rat
out my crew,

25:28.069 --> 25:29.669
You need to fire your profiler.

25:29.671 --> 25:31.804
Think so?

25:31.806 --> 25:34.073
I figured at least a couple
of your pals

25:34.075 --> 25:37.743
Might actually consider
doing the time,

25:37.745 --> 25:41.047
But you--you have a daughter,
don't you?

25:42.450 --> 25:44.750
A daughter who needs you.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.519
It's just the two of you,
isn't it?

26:03.304 --> 26:04.937
You can give your daughter
her blouse

26:04.939 --> 26:06.672
And maintain
her sense of normalcy,

26:06.674 --> 26:08.541
But i need to know
we have a deal.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.042
I need to think about it.

26:10.044 --> 26:11.844
You're not getting
the basic concept here.

26:11.846 --> 26:14.180
You're holding my daughter's
recital hostage now too?

26:14.182 --> 26:17.650
Your life changed
three hours ago, detective.

26:17.652 --> 26:21.287
You need to start
accepting that fact.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.455
Hers doesn't need to.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.991
Two minutes,

26:24.993 --> 26:27.593
Otherwise I'll be left feeling
you'd rather be behind bars.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.333
Oh, my god, you are my savior.

26:34.335 --> 26:36.135
What took you so long?

26:36.137 --> 26:37.636
Late arrest,
the wagon broke down.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.305
Mom, it was
a rhetorical question.

26:41.909 --> 26:44.143
You know i'm so proud
of you, right?

26:44.145 --> 26:46.212
You know, i know you've worked
so hard for this.

26:46.214 --> 26:47.713
Mom, you're gonna jinx me.

26:47.715 --> 26:51.684
Could you just
tell me later, please?

26:51.686 --> 26:55.221
That's the thing.
I can't stay.

26:55.223 --> 26:56.689
Now, you know
i wouldn't miss this

26:56.691 --> 26:59.859
Unless it was something
important, right?

26:59.861 --> 27:03.095
Yeah.

27:03.097 --> 27:04.563
I get it.

27:04.565 --> 27:06.165
Baby, you're gonna be s--

27:32.193 --> 27:34.026
Hey, we saved you a seat.
Hey.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.228
Hey, what are you doing here?
You think we'd miss this?

27:36.230 --> 27:39.432
Our girl's got a solo.

27:39.434 --> 27:41.267
Excuse me, is this taken?

27:41.269 --> 27:43.102
No, go right ahead.

27:43.104 --> 27:44.403
Thank you.

28:12.324 --> 28:16.093
Get away from me.
He's not stupid.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.695
Tell me that you're in,

28:17.697 --> 28:19.697
And you can stay here
with your daughter.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.533
You can attend every one
of her concerts in the future,

28:22.535 --> 28:26.971
But if you warn wozniak
about any of this in any way,

28:26.973 --> 28:28.539
I'll know,

28:28.541 --> 28:30.374
And i'll haul your ass to jail.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.045
So what's it gonna be, harlee?

28:34.047 --> 28:35.112
I need to know right now.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.848
Are you in, or are you out?

28:41.287 --> 28:42.753
He's coming over here.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.855
In or out?

28:48.394 --> 28:49.660
In.

28:49.662 --> 28:51.495
- Incredible.
- Thank you.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.663
Talented beyond her years.

28:52.665 --> 28:54.999
You know,
she works hard at it.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.001
There you go,
independent confirmation.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.470
I can't believe how much poise
she had after her car got hit.

28:59.472 --> 29:00.972
Yeah.
You know what?

29:00.974 --> 29:02.807
Maybe we don't mention that.
Of course.

29:02.809 --> 29:06.110
Ah, there she is,
carnegie hall.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.678
You were great.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.280
Thanks, uncle woz.
Flat out amazing, honey.

29:10.283 --> 29:13.150
Thank you.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.185
I'm glad you stayed.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.420
it was beautiful.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.523
Thank you.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.025
I got to go.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.360
Duty calls.

29:22.362 --> 29:24.362
Your runner's girlfriend
woke up talking.

29:24.364 --> 29:26.297
I got the address.

29:26.299 --> 29:27.798
You were great, excellent.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.768
See you at home.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.853
Earl spotted us
on the platform and jetted.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.354
Tiger jacket
and yellow kicks.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.525
<i>I got him.</i>
<i>Suspect running east on 64th.</i>

30:05.805 --> 30:06.804
Get on the ground!

30:06.806 --> 30:07.805
Get on the ground now!

30:09.075 --> 30:10.741
Loman, he's yours!
Police, stop!

30:10.743 --> 30:11.976
Stop right there!
He's yours!

30:11.978 --> 30:14.545
Stop right there!

30:17.383 --> 30:19.684
stop! Police!

30:19.686 --> 30:22.520
Stop!
Don't make me chase you!

30:22.522 --> 30:24.188
Get on the ground!

30:27.694 --> 30:29.327
<i>Suspect last seen westbound</i>
<i>on 65th.</i>

30:52.385 --> 30:54.018
Got to hand it to you, earl.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.220
That's how you resist arrest.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.255
Little help?
You got him, good job.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.790
i didn't do nothing.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.393
That's a hard sell
after ten blocks.

31:15.742 --> 31:17.742
Jason bourne?

31:17.744 --> 31:19.710
I plugged my contact info
into your phone.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.213
You can change the name
to whatever you remember.

31:22.215 --> 31:24.215
I can think of a few names.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.150
<i>Sunset pier,</i>
<i>salt silo, 3:00 p.m.</i>

31:26.152 --> 31:28.319
<i>If you're not there,</i>
<i>i come get you.</i>

31:29.589 --> 31:30.788
Is that your daddy calling?

31:32.091 --> 31:35.826
Anything else?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

31:35.828 --> 31:38.996
I just wanted to say i'm looking
forward to working with you,

31:38.998 --> 31:40.831
<i>And that's--</i>

31:41.934 --> 31:43.701
That's--

31:44.704 --> 31:45.836
Hey.

31:45.838 --> 31:47.805
Earl took me to the rest
of the bad dope.

31:47.807 --> 31:50.508
He had it
in a laundromat basement.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.510
Caper closed,
peace on the streets.

31:52.512 --> 31:54.178
Yeah.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.313
<i>I forgot to tell you,</i>
<i>7:30 tomorrow morning</i>

31:56.315 --> 31:58.249
<i>A tow truck's coming</i>
<i>to your house.</i>

31:58.251 --> 31:59.316
Tow truck?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.152
Yeah, for cristina's car.

32:01.154 --> 32:02.787
<i>You said she banged it up.</i>

32:02.789 --> 32:04.355
<i>Rodney over at</i>
<i>the precinct motor pool,</i>

32:04.357 --> 32:05.856
<i>He's hooking you up.</i>

32:05.858 --> 32:07.958
You know,
woz, you don't have to do that.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.428
It's better she learns that
not everyone has a motor pool.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.130
I know, but take advantage
of it, all right?

32:13.132 --> 32:15.299
Home safe.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.201
Safe tomorrow.

34:08.757 --> 34:10.489
Bought you a beer.

34:10.492 --> 34:12.992
Man, you can't cuff
me out here for an hour.

34:14.062 --> 34:15.695
Save it for later.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.440
<i>I got my lawyer.</i>

34:27.442 --> 34:29.375
<i>You don't get a lawyer.</i>

34:29.377 --> 34:30.976
All you get is me.

34:30.978 --> 34:34.047
Look, ain't no
big play here.

34:34.049 --> 34:36.181
Jamarr and i sold alone
looking to make a quick dollar,

34:36.184 --> 34:37.382
Not wrestle corners.

34:37.385 --> 34:39.418
It wouldn't be
if your buddy jamarr

34:39.420 --> 34:41.420
Hadn't taken a shot
at a cop.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.289
You'd be in a lot
less trouble now, my friend.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.091
Hey, jamarr
didn't even have a piece.

34:45.092 --> 34:46.993
He got popped playing
video games.

34:46.995 --> 34:48.293
I find that very hard
to believe.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.728
I was there.

34:49.731 --> 34:53.399
Had to bolt before
he shot my ass too.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.136
Pig's lucky i didn't have
my own piece.

34:56.138 --> 34:57.470
I'd have put two
between his eyes

34:57.472 --> 34:59.072
Before the bitch could blink.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.177
Did you tell anybody that?

35:06.047 --> 35:08.047
Like i said,

35:08.049 --> 35:10.483
I want my lawyer.

35:10.485 --> 35:13.286
Let me ask you something,
earl.

35:13.288 --> 35:14.287
You got kids?

35:14.289 --> 35:15.655
Hell, no.

35:15.657 --> 35:18.191
I wrap my junk up.

35:18.193 --> 35:19.959
That's good.

35:19.961 --> 35:22.829
If you were a father,
i'd have to think twice.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.364
From what i understand,

35:24.366 --> 35:27.066
You're a selfish prick
with a blatant disregard

35:27.068 --> 35:29.969
For innocent life,
who happens to have information

35:29.971 --> 35:32.272
That could hurt someone
that i love,

35:32.274 --> 35:33.773
So you leave me
with two options.

35:33.775 --> 35:37.110
Book you,

35:37.112 --> 35:39.479
Keep a clean conscience
and my head down,

35:39.481 --> 35:42.582
But i make
the hard choices, earl.

35:42.584 --> 35:45.985
I sacrifice for the needs
of the neighborhood,

35:45.987 --> 35:48.021
And you, my friend,

35:48.023 --> 35:50.723
Are on the other side
of that scale.

35:55.063 --> 35:56.095
What the hell, man?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Man, no, please.
Please, i--i won't say anything.

36:01.002 --> 36:02.402
Don't be playing me, man.

36:02.404 --> 36:04.204
I won't say anything,
please, just--

36:04.206 --> 36:06.172
Please don't--

36:09.344 --> 36:10.443
man, please.

36:10.445 --> 36:11.778
Please, i'm begging you.
Please.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.947
For the greater good, earl.

36:13.949 --> 36:15.848
I protect and serve it.

36:38.640 --> 36:42.275
He knows, doesn't he?

36:42.277 --> 36:43.476
What we did.

36:47.382 --> 36:50.383
Look, he'll protect you.

36:50.385 --> 36:53.386
He'll expect loyalty,

36:53.388 --> 36:54.721
But he'll protect you.

36:57.292 --> 36:59.892
What do you mean by "loyalty"?

36:59.894 --> 37:01.761
It depends on the day.

37:09.938 --> 37:11.471
Hey, sorry i'm late.
Hey.

37:11.473 --> 37:13.139
I don't have a lot of time.

37:13.141 --> 37:16.676
Linda's got me shopping
for the barbecue tonight.

37:16.678 --> 37:19.545
You celebrating your team's
impeccable performance record?

37:19.547 --> 37:21.748
We're covered
on your end, right?

37:21.750 --> 37:23.483
Loman officially made
a clean shoot.

37:23.485 --> 37:24.751
Hey, as far as i'm concerned,

37:24.753 --> 37:25.818
Your rookie,

37:25.820 --> 37:27.086
He did us all a favor.

37:27.088 --> 37:28.755
The kid might be worth
protecting.

37:28.757 --> 37:30.957
Well, it's all about
protecting harlee.

37:30.959 --> 37:33.359
You know that.

37:33.361 --> 37:35.428
I want to bring her
in on the job.

37:35.430 --> 37:37.764
Not until we have to.

37:37.766 --> 37:39.432
These people value discretion.

37:39.434 --> 37:41.801
We make them happy,
we all benefit.

37:41.803 --> 37:44.437
One night
providing security only.

37:44.439 --> 37:46.139
One night, lieutenant.

38:02.891 --> 38:04.590
Where did you get that?

38:04.592 --> 38:06.426
This is the piece of jewelry
that you wear the most.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.195
My daughter gave it to me.

38:09.197 --> 38:11.531
Now it's her gift
to the criminal justice system.

38:11.533 --> 38:13.366
You never said anything
about wearing a wire.

38:13.368 --> 38:15.335
I didn't say anything
about a lot of things.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.570
That's how this works,
so turn around.

38:17.572 --> 38:18.938
I got to set it.

38:22.544 --> 38:25.978
I said turn around...

38:25.980 --> 38:27.480
Now.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.053
Lift your hair.

38:40.495 --> 38:42.428
Stay out of my apartment.

38:44.566 --> 38:45.965
There's a camera in the stone.

38:45.967 --> 38:47.300
Audio's in the setting.

38:47.302 --> 38:49.769
It emits a signal
that we can pick up

38:49.771 --> 38:51.003
From within a few hundred yards.

38:51.005 --> 38:52.271
Are you done yet?

38:56.177 --> 38:58.311
Say something
so i can test it.

39:03.184 --> 39:04.917
These are good people.

39:17.932 --> 39:21.601
<i>- Yo, woz.</i>
<i>- Hey, yo, yo, mami.</i>

39:21.603 --> 39:24.036
Oh, you gorgeous girl.

39:24.038 --> 39:26.005
Oh, glad to see
you could make it.

39:26.007 --> 39:28.441
<i>Why are you always late?</i>
<i>Why can't you ever be on time?</i>

39:28.443 --> 39:31.444
- Right?
- Ah.

39:31.446 --> 39:33.246
Fruit.

39:33.248 --> 39:35.281
<i>I know, nobody</i>
<i>eats fruit at a barbecue.</i>

39:43.057 --> 39:45.091
All righty.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.527
Come back for more.

39:47.529 --> 39:48.761
We get it.
Next to the laundry.

39:48.763 --> 39:50.463
But the laundry room
went downstairs.

39:50.465 --> 39:51.964
That's what we did.
So woz will go immediately--

39:51.966 --> 39:53.032
<i>Is there a charger anywhere?</i>

40:01.376 --> 40:03.176
<i>Oh, it's all good.</i>

40:03.178 --> 40:04.610
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:04.612 --> 40:08.181
Oh, he's burning
the burgers again.

40:08.183 --> 40:11.384
What would the man
do without us?

40:11.386 --> 40:13.085
Goes both ways.

40:13.087 --> 40:14.454
<i>No, I have a kid,</i>
<i>so you and i--</i>

40:16.124 --> 40:18.057
<i>I think you're gonna start</i>
<i>getting into, like,</i>

40:18.059 --> 40:20.526
<i>Professional cooking.</i>

40:20.528 --> 40:22.028
<i>No, i'll let you come over</i>
<i>for that.</i>

40:24.866 --> 40:26.799
<i>In here.</i>

40:26.801 --> 40:28.267
<i>What is it?</i>

40:28.269 --> 40:29.302
What's the matter?

40:29.304 --> 40:30.736
<i>What happened?</i>

40:30.738 --> 40:34.207
<i>Every betrayal</i>
<i>begins with trust.</i>

40:35.210 --> 40:36.809
<i>- What betrayal?</i>

40:36.811 --> 40:39.011
<i>The one that you</i>
<i>never see coming.</i>

40:39.013 --> 40:40.346
One that you--

40:40.348 --> 40:43.282
You don't--you don't
think to look for.

40:43.284 --> 40:44.517
<i>You anticipate--</i>

40:44.519 --> 40:47.019
<i>You anticipate certain--</i>

40:47.021 --> 40:49.422
<i>Certain--certain things.</i>

40:49.424 --> 40:51.524
<i>That's how you survive.</i>

40:51.526 --> 40:53.626
But not this.

40:53.628 --> 40:55.962
Not this.

40:55.964 --> 40:57.630
What happened?

40:57.632 --> 41:00.433
<i>Not happened--</i>
<i>it's happening.</i>

41:00.435 --> 41:02.835
<i>There's a rat.</i>

41:02.837 --> 41:03.836
<i>There's a rat!</i>

41:05.640 --> 41:08.407
An fbi informant

41:08.409 --> 41:09.809
<i>On my team!</i>

41:15.817 --> 41:17.250
<i>I need to kill it.</i>

41:21.523 --> 41:23.322
I need to kill it.

41:37.705 --> 41:40.673
And you're gonna help me

41:40.675 --> 41:43.109
Because you're the only one
I trust.
