01:00.507 --> 01:01.648
Hey, everyone.

01:01.748 --> 01:04.651
I'm Abby Walker
and I am so honoured

01:04.751 --> 01:06.893
to have been selected
to perform tonight

01:06.993 --> 01:10.737
here at the Emerging Artists
Christmas Showcase.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.540
I wanna play a song for you
that I wrote recently.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.503
It's a Christmas song called
"Christmas Without You".

01:17.603 --> 01:18.945
I hope you like it.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.047
It's an Abby Walker
original.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.630
You all have been
so awesome.

03:27.730 --> 03:29.191
Bravo!

03:35.857 --> 03:36.919
I loved your song.

03:37.019 --> 03:39.521
Thanks so much.

03:39.621 --> 03:42.704
You have an amazing talent.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.528
Oh my gosh.

03:46.628 --> 03:47.969
You're Casey Macey.

03:48.069 --> 03:52.293
The Casey Macey, the superstar,
likes my song.

03:54.035 --> 03:56.337
My label's looking for
a Christmas single for me.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.379
Maybe we could team up
and write something?

03:58.479 --> 04:02.303
Uh, yeah! I'd love to.
Of course.

04:02.403 --> 04:04.185
It would be an honour
to work with you.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.287
Wow.

04:07.969 --> 04:09.970
Set it up with my manager.

04:24.505 --> 04:28.448
So, have you heard
from Casey's manager?

04:28.548 --> 04:30.691
It's been what,
over a month now?

04:30.791 --> 04:32.653
I'm sorry, honey.

04:32.753 --> 04:34.374
They never got back to me
about a meeting,

04:34.474 --> 04:36.576
but that's the way
things are in the biz.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.678
There'll be
other opportunities.

04:39.439 --> 04:42.062
Well, you think we could
send my song out to labels?

04:42.162 --> 04:44.344
Or maybe someone else
is looking for an opener?

04:44.444 --> 04:46.466
Abby, I've been trying
to pitch you as an artist

04:46.566 --> 04:48.188
all over town
for almost a year now.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.150
No one's responded yet.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.353
But, I do have
a ton of offers

04:53.453 --> 04:55.234
for you to write songs
for commercials.

04:55.334 --> 04:58.277
Commercials?
Like advertisements?

04:58.377 --> 05:00.720
It's a booming industry.
Very lucrative.

05:00.820 --> 05:01.801
You'd be perfect.

05:01.901 --> 05:05.124
What do you say?
- I don't know.

05:05.224 --> 05:08.567
Writing commercials
seems a bit soul-killing.

05:08.667 --> 05:09.809
I'm an artist.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.051
Well, I know
it's no Casey Macey,

05:12.151 --> 05:14.293
but um,
it's a good living.

05:14.393 --> 05:16.675
And you need to pay rent,
right?

05:19.198 --> 05:20.379
I guess I could try.

05:20.479 --> 05:21.860
- McKayla?
- Yes?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.782
Email Abby
those commercial gigs.

05:23.882 --> 05:25.924
Oh, and make me a smoothie.
You know what I like.

05:29.928 --> 05:31.109
We'll be in touch.

05:40.618 --> 05:42.200
It's catchy, huh?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.602
That's my song.
I wrote that song!

05:44.702 --> 05:48.006
Well, I know a lot of these
Christmas songs sound similar,

05:48.106 --> 05:49.527
but no,
I think it's different.

Sorry.

06:21.658 --> 06:23.640
Love that song.

06:23.740 --> 06:26.203
And I can
take that call later.

06:28.665 --> 06:31.127
Anyways,
Seventh Heaven paper towels

06:31.227 --> 06:32.889
are the softest
in the market.

06:32.989 --> 06:34.851
We know that.

06:34.951 --> 06:37.814
We just need our audience
to know that. So Abby,

06:37.914 --> 06:40.657
if you could be sure to write
some lyrics about softness,

06:40.757 --> 06:41.778
maybe some absorbency,

06:41.878 --> 06:43.700
that'd be fantastic.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.341
But focus on the softness,

06:45.441 --> 06:47.904
because people love
soft paper towels.

06:48.004 --> 06:50.987
-
- Sure, no problem. Softness.

06:51.087 --> 06:53.549
Mission statement,

06:53.649 --> 06:55.911
good for everyone,
affordable...

07:18.153 --> 07:19.815
You used to love
Christmas songs.

07:19.915 --> 07:22.777
I still do, but this one just
reminds me a little too much

07:22.877 --> 07:24.879
of something I wrote.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.903
- How's the songwriting going?
- It's not.

07:29.003 --> 07:30.665
You know, I'm pretty busy
with work these days.

07:30.765 --> 07:32.427
Ugh, Abby, you're so busy
with these commercials

07:32.527 --> 07:34.909
that you're never gonna have
time to focus on your own songs.

07:35.009 --> 07:37.151
Whitney, I am writing
this commercial for you.

07:37.251 --> 07:38.913
Is this your way
of firing me?

07:39.013 --> 07:40.675
Of course not.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.196
But at this point,
I'm more concerned for you

07:42.296 --> 07:44.799
as a friend
than a coworker.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.240
Commercials aren't
where your heart is.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.002
You don't even sing them
for us anymore.

07:48.102 --> 07:52.806
I mean, when's the last time you
performed in front of anyone?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.908
I can't remember.

07:57.471 --> 07:59.173
When I first met you,

07:59.273 --> 08:01.175
you had these big dreams
of being an artist,

08:01.275 --> 08:03.497
of releasing
your first Christmas hit.

08:03.597 --> 08:04.538
What happened?

08:04.638 --> 08:06.820
I guess I just haven't been

08:06.920 --> 08:09.503
in the Christmas spirit lately,
you know?

08:09.603 --> 08:11.104
Well, you haven't been
in the Christmas spirit

08:11.204 --> 08:12.826
because you don't have
any Christmas decorations

08:12.926 --> 08:14.708
at your house.
- I have a tree.

08:14.808 --> 08:17.130
Well, it's tiny, it's busted,
and your mother sent it to you.

08:20.854 --> 08:22.675
Maybe you should go home
for the holidays.

08:22.775 --> 08:24.557
You're always telling me
how well your hometown

08:24.657 --> 08:26.399
does Christmas.
- No, I can't do that.

08:26.499 --> 08:28.801
I have to turn in
this paper towel song,

08:28.901 --> 08:30.363
got one
for a hardware store,

08:30.463 --> 08:31.804
a frozen yogurt commercial
that's due.

08:31.904 --> 08:33.646
Maybe going home
will inspire you

08:33.746 --> 08:35.368
to write
your own songs again.

08:35.468 --> 08:39.131
Whitney, I am perfectly capable
of writing a Christmas song

I think I will come home
for Christmas this year.

10:26.015 --> 10:29.278

- I can't believe it either!

- Do I have to?
-

10:39.628 --> 10:40.969
I got all your favourites
in the kitchen.

10:41.069 --> 10:43.272
Come on, come on.
Take your coat off.

10:45.073 --> 10:47.075
Great to be home.

10:57.045 --> 10:58.346

- Okay, Mom,

10:58.446 --> 11:00.468
I love you but
you're smooshing me again.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.871
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Here.

11:02.971 --> 11:05.874
Have some hot cider.
- Thanks.

11:05.974 --> 11:08.516
Nice slippers!
What are those, polar bears?

11:08.616 --> 11:10.398
Mm-hm. Don't worry,
I got you a pair too.

11:10.498 --> 11:11.479
They're in your room.

11:11.579 --> 11:13.361
- Perfect.
-

11:13.461 --> 11:15.603
So, how long you staying?
- Just through Christmas.

11:15.703 --> 11:19.206
Oh. You sure you don't
wanna stay longer?

11:19.306 --> 11:21.128
They are looking
for a co-director

11:21.228 --> 11:22.410
of the music department
at my school.

11:22.510 --> 11:24.171
- Mom...
- You'd be perfect.

11:24.271 --> 11:26.133
..I have a whole life
in New York.

11:26.233 --> 11:28.275
I know, I know.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.420
I see you bought
more ornaments?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.142
I don't think you could
possibly fit

11:35.242 --> 11:38.065
any more Christmas decorations
in this house.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.347
They're for the annual
Christmas pageant.

11:40.447 --> 11:42.509
I'm in charge this year.

11:42.609 --> 11:44.871
Oh. Being principal
isn't enough work?

11:44.971 --> 11:46.593
Well,
it's kind of a big deal.

11:46.693 --> 11:48.915
It's our school's turn
to host the whole ceremony.

11:49.015 --> 11:50.997
- Oh, nice!
- Speaking of school,

11:51.097 --> 11:53.039
you should swing by
and maybe check out

11:53.139 --> 11:54.160
the old stomping grounds?

11:54.260 --> 11:56.643
- I think I will.
- Mm-hm?

11:56.743 --> 11:59.746
- I'll bring sandwiches.
- That sounds great!

12:24.850 --> 12:26.312
- Hey!
- Oh! Whoa!

12:26.412 --> 12:28.894
There goes lunch.

12:30.175 --> 12:31.116
Oh, uh--

12:31.216 --> 12:35.160
Um-- Sorry.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.322
It's okay.
I wasn't hungry anyway.

12:37.422 --> 12:39.684
Starving.

12:39.784 --> 12:41.646
Okay. Hey, are you
the new sub?

12:41.746 --> 12:43.048
Huh?

12:43.148 --> 12:44.369
Can you watch my class
for a little bit?

12:44.469 --> 12:46.011
I got a bit
of a tuba situation.

12:46.111 --> 12:47.932
Uh, I don't work here, Sir.

12:48.032 --> 12:50.335
Sorry, but good luck
with your situation!

12:50.435 --> 12:53.218
Yeah, um, if you could
just come down to the school...

12:53.318 --> 12:55.860
- Where do I sign in?
- Hi. Go over there.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.102
Oh, thanks.

12:58.202 --> 12:59.704
Hi, honey. Take a seat.

12:59.804 --> 13:03.107
Sorry about that. Yes.
Two o'clock would be great.

13:03.207 --> 13:05.790
Thank you. That would
be great, superintendent.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.152
I really look forward to
speaking to you about the--

13:08.252 --> 13:09.473
All right.
Let's hurry this up, Ethan.

13:09.573 --> 13:10.995
I gotta get back
to my students

13:11.095 --> 13:12.636
that actually play
their instruments in class.

13:12.736 --> 13:14.158
I'm telling you, Mr. Tucker,
you can send me

13:14.258 --> 13:15.799
to the principal's office
all you want,

13:15.899 --> 13:17.481
but it will not make me enjoy
playing the triangle.

13:17.581 --> 13:19.083
Who says
you have to enjoy it?

13:19.183 --> 13:21.045
You just have to hit
two pieces of steel together.

13:21.145 --> 13:22.286
And not text in my class.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.968
I wasn't texting!
I was reading.

13:25.068 --> 13:26.370
- What were you reading?
- Kerouac.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.331
Hi, honey.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.052
Okay, I love Kerouac.

13:29.152 --> 13:31.735
- Right? The sense of freedom?
- Possibilities.

13:31.835 --> 13:33.737
It's like--
it's like an adventure.

13:33.837 --> 13:35.459
Okay, so,
what did you do this time?

13:35.559 --> 13:37.941
- He was reading in music class.
- Oh, better than texting.

13:38.041 --> 13:39.542
What can I say?
You guys won't let me graduate

13:39.642 --> 13:40.744
without taking
an arts elective.

13:40.844 --> 13:43.006
Please come in.

13:45.328 --> 13:47.150
Honey, I'm sorry.
Can we reschedule?

13:47.250 --> 13:49.192
Duty calls.
- No problem.

13:49.292 --> 13:51.294
The sandwiches
got ruined anyway.

13:53.176 --> 13:55.638
But I have a lot of work
to do, so.

13:55.738 --> 13:58.161
You should work
in the music rehearsal room.

13:58.261 --> 13:59.242
One should be free.

13:59.342 --> 14:02.204
Maybe I will. Thanks!

14:02.304 --> 14:05.047
See you at dinner, Mom.

14:05.147 --> 14:06.729
Travis, Linda called
about the set decorations

14:06.829 --> 14:08.250
for the pageant?
- Mm-hm.

14:08.350 --> 14:11.934
And Sandra dropped these off
for you. Costumes.

14:12.034 --> 14:14.096
You'll have to decide
who's wearing what.

14:14.196 --> 14:15.137
Fabulous.

14:15.237 --> 14:17.239
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

14:34.295 --> 14:36.297
Perfect.

14:37.859 --> 14:39.861
Okay.

14:46.307 --> 14:48.429
Where to start?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.856
♪ Soft as a daydream ♪

14:55.956 --> 14:58.579
♪ Gentle to touch ♪

14:58.679 --> 15:03.584
♪ I never knew
I could love you so much ♪

15:03.684 --> 15:05.626
♪ You absorb all my spills ♪

15:05.726 --> 15:07.628

15:07.728 --> 15:10.391
♪ You're all that I'll use

15:10.491 --> 15:12.553

15:12.653 --> 15:14.675
Oh, no. That's--
That's not right.

15:14.775 --> 15:16.597
Um--

15:16.697 --> 15:20.560
♪ You absorb all my spills,
no matter how big ♪

15:20.660 --> 15:22.682
Am I-- hearing things

15:22.782 --> 15:25.565
or did you just do
an ode to paper towel?

15:25.665 --> 15:27.807
I'm Travis.
I'm the band teacher.

15:27.907 --> 15:29.249
Your voice is lovely,
by the way.

15:29.349 --> 15:32.452
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I write songs
for commercials.

15:32.552 --> 15:34.294
Really?
That's an interesting job.

15:34.394 --> 15:37.257
Thanks. It actually
keeps me pretty busy.

15:37.357 --> 15:39.358
So, if you don't mind...

15:40.520 --> 15:43.342
So, you make a living
songwriting

15:43.442 --> 15:45.725
without even having to write
real songs?

15:47.927 --> 15:49.629
Oh, no, oh, no.
I didn't mean--

15:49.729 --> 15:51.150
You know what I mean.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.354
I don't, actually.
What exactly do you mean?

15:55.454 --> 15:59.638
Uh, I guess I'm saying
that your music is more--

15:59.738 --> 16:02.321
marketing than art, right?

16:02.421 --> 16:06.365
And I suppose you're
a pure artistic musician?

16:08.186 --> 16:10.509
I like to think so.

16:13.512 --> 16:15.253
Oh, it's from your mom.

16:16.595 --> 16:18.296
"Talk to Billy
about the lighting

16:18.396 --> 16:21.339
"and sound system
for the pageant."

16:21.439 --> 16:23.341
Well, sounds like
you have your hands full

16:23.441 --> 16:26.024
of purely artistic
musical tasks.

16:26.124 --> 16:28.126
I'll leave you to it.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.130
Touché.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.820
So, what's the deal
with that guy?

17:03.920 --> 17:06.583
- What guy, honey?
- The band teacher, Travis?

17:06.683 --> 17:09.466
Oh, isn't he great?
He just started this year.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.268
He seems kind of rude.

17:11.368 --> 17:13.470
Oh, he just
has his hands full.

17:13.570 --> 17:16.633
He's juggling the whole music
department by himself right now.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.235
And his class is performing
the tree ceremony.

17:19.335 --> 17:20.717
Hope he can handle
the pressure.

17:20.817 --> 17:24.080
Oh, I'm sure he'll be great.
He used to teach

17:24.180 --> 17:26.442
at one of those fancy performing
arts schools in New York.

17:26.542 --> 17:28.564
We're lucky to have him!

17:28.664 --> 17:30.606
Wow. If he taught
at such a fancy school,

17:30.706 --> 17:32.368
why'd he come to Bellville?

17:32.468 --> 17:35.411
I think his dad retired here and
he wanted to be closer to him.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.533
You know,
you could do the same thing.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.775
- Mom.
- We could see each other

17:39.875 --> 17:43.058
all the time and no more
back and forth from New York.

17:43.158 --> 17:47.182
That'd be very nice, but
you know my job is in New York.

17:47.282 --> 17:50.205
I had to try.

18:01.897 --> 18:04.239
We could continue
this conversation later,

18:04.339 --> 18:05.640
but my vote's fairly set.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.322
I know you care
about the arts program,

18:07.422 --> 18:09.965
but the way the budget's
lining up,

18:10.065 --> 18:13.088
it just might not make sense
to keep it.

18:13.188 --> 18:16.411
I really hope we can change
your mind, superintendent.

18:16.511 --> 18:18.593
Have a good day.

18:21.275 --> 18:22.497
Hey, Mom.

18:22.597 --> 18:24.779
Thought I'd try again
with sandwiches.

18:24.879 --> 18:27.001
Hey, honey.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.944
Everything okay?

18:30.044 --> 18:32.226
- Uh--
- Oh, Travis.

18:32.326 --> 18:33.828
Hi.
- Hey.

18:33.928 --> 18:35.549
Hello, Travis.

18:35.649 --> 18:37.591
How's the song for the pageant
coming along?

18:37.691 --> 18:39.033
"Deck the Halls"
is one of my favourites.

18:39.133 --> 18:40.714
It's good.
It's good, yeah.

18:40.814 --> 18:44.198
Um, although, I still have
to sort the set decoration.

18:44.298 --> 18:46.360
And the lighting.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.282
And the costumes.

18:48.382 --> 18:51.925
It would really help if we could
fill that co-director position.

18:52.025 --> 18:53.447
Abby,
you'll fill in, right?

18:53.547 --> 18:56.129
What? Mom, you know
I'm super busy.

18:56.229 --> 18:57.531
Yeah, no.

18:57.631 --> 18:58.932
I meant fill the position
down the road.

18:59.032 --> 19:00.614
I mean, I can handle it.

19:00.714 --> 19:03.296
Well, I wasn't gonna
mention this,

19:03.396 --> 19:04.497
but we just got
some terrible news.

19:04.597 --> 19:05.779
What's wrong?

19:05.879 --> 19:08.381
I just found out
that the school board

19:08.481 --> 19:10.743
is thinking about taking our
performing arts funding away.

19:10.843 --> 19:13.706
Oh, no!
Why would they do that?

19:13.806 --> 19:15.548
They wanna give the money
to sports.

19:15.648 --> 19:17.070
They get most
of the money anyway.

19:17.170 --> 19:19.432
The superintendent
is just one of those people

19:19.532 --> 19:21.514
who doesn't see
the value in arts.

19:21.614 --> 19:24.877
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. The problem is,

19:24.977 --> 19:28.080
the board takes most
of their voting cues from him.

19:28.180 --> 19:30.523
They're voting right after
the Christmas pageant.

19:30.623 --> 19:34.046
Okay. So,
here's what you're gonna do.

19:34.146 --> 19:37.449
You have to make this
the best pageant ever.

19:37.549 --> 19:39.571
You have to convince him

19:39.671 --> 19:42.414
the students need
these arts programs.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.296
So you'll help, right?
You'll fill in?

19:44.396 --> 19:46.058
Just for now.

19:46.158 --> 19:48.380
I mean, I guess an extra hand
couldn't hurt, right?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.983
Please, honey.
We really need you.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.306
Please,
it's only temporary.

19:54.406 --> 19:56.628
Okay. I'll do it.
I'll help.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.190
Thank you.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.292
Good.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.122
I can't believe
I got roped into this.

20:11.222 --> 20:12.123
Yikes.

20:12.223 --> 20:13.764
Sounds like a mess.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.326
So, tell me more
about this guy.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.408
What guy?
- The band teacher!

20:17.508 --> 20:18.449
What's he like?

20:18.549 --> 20:20.531
He's whatever.

20:20.631 --> 20:22.053
He's all over the place.

20:22.153 --> 20:23.814
- Is he cute?
-

20:23.914 --> 20:26.657
What? No!

20:26.757 --> 20:27.938
I don't know.

20:28.038 --> 20:31.622
He's adequate.
- Mmm, he's "adequate".

20:33.283 --> 20:34.865
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.788
Um, I have to go
deal with this.

20:37.888 --> 20:41.071
The employees get a little nuts
during these Christmas parties.

20:41.171 --> 20:42.352
But I'm sorry
you're going through

20:42.452 --> 20:43.673
what you're going through.

20:43.773 --> 20:46.716
It's okay.
Thanks for listening.

20:46.816 --> 20:49.639
- Good luck tomorrow, okay?
- Thanks. I'll need it.

20:49.739 --> 20:51.521
- Awesome.
-

20:51.621 --> 20:53.703
Hey. Hey, you!

21:14.043 --> 21:17.026
Everybody, we have a very
special guest joining us today.

21:17.126 --> 21:20.429
I would like for you
to welcome Abby Walker.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.951
- Hi!
Hi.

21:22.051 --> 21:23.552
This is
Principal Walker's daughter.

21:23.652 --> 21:25.114
And uh,
she's gonna be helping us out

21:25.214 --> 21:26.675
for the next few weeks,

21:26.775 --> 21:28.197
just before the tree ceremony
performance.

21:28.297 --> 21:30.799
Now, she writes music
for commercials,

21:30.899 --> 21:31.920
so she knows
what she's doing.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.962
Really? That's cool.

21:34.062 --> 21:35.043
Would you sing us one?

21:35.143 --> 21:37.325
Oh, no.

21:37.425 --> 21:39.407
It's been a while
since I've sung for anyone.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.089
I heard you singing yesterday
and you were great.

21:41.189 --> 21:42.530
Yeah, sing for us.

21:42.630 --> 21:45.573
Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing!

21:46.875 --> 21:50.338
Okay. Fine.

21:50.438 --> 21:53.101
Uh, how about this one?

21:53.201 --> 21:55.583
Um, let's see.

21:55.683 --> 21:57.025

Wow.

22:30.597 --> 22:32.259
Your voice is incredible.

22:32.359 --> 22:35.942
That was actually moving.
That's a commercial?

22:36.042 --> 22:37.984
Yeah, for the dog food ad?

22:38.084 --> 22:40.627
Uh, with the golden retriever
and the kid?

22:40.727 --> 22:41.868
Oh, yeah!

22:41.968 --> 22:43.630
You should sing
for our performance.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.271
- Yes!
-

22:45.371 --> 22:47.634
That's a great idea.
It would really impress

22:47.734 --> 22:49.595
the superintendent
with your singing.

22:49.695 --> 22:51.678
Oh, no. I don't think so.

22:51.778 --> 22:53.159
I don't want to take away
from you guys.

22:53.259 --> 22:54.680
Oh, you wouldn't be.
I mean, I feel like

22:54.780 --> 22:56.162
it would really
bring everything together.

22:56.262 --> 22:58.164
-
- Enough about me.

22:58.264 --> 23:01.947
How about I hear
your performance song?

23:03.189 --> 23:05.851
You heard the woman.
You ready?

23:05.951 --> 23:07.052
Let's show her
a bit of what we got.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.133
Ugh.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.235
Really, Ethan?

23:11.437 --> 23:13.438
Sorry.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.902
One, two, three, and--

23:49.994 --> 23:51.295
Excellent.

23:51.395 --> 23:53.397
You guys are getting better
every day.

23:54.478 --> 23:56.300
What do you think?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.742
It sounds amazing!

23:57.842 --> 23:59.864
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

23:59.964 --> 24:02.066
May I make a tiny comment?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.828
- Be my guest.
- Okay.

24:04.928 --> 24:06.910
You guys sound really good,

24:07.010 --> 24:09.913
but I can tell
that you're trying so hard

24:10.013 --> 24:11.675
to make everything perfect

24:11.775 --> 24:14.598
that you're not really
feeling the music.

24:14.698 --> 24:16.880
Well, there's nothing wrong
with perfection. Right?

24:16.980 --> 24:19.563
Well, the audience
won't notice technique

24:19.663 --> 24:22.926
but they will notice if the
music makes them feel something.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.809
But, proper technique
is important too.

24:25.909 --> 24:27.570
You need to have
a solid understanding

24:27.670 --> 24:29.652
of the fundamentals of music if
you're gonna be any good at it.

24:29.752 --> 24:30.653
Sure!

24:30.753 --> 24:32.215
But if you get bogged down

24:32.315 --> 24:34.657
with too much of that stuff,
it's going to feel like school.

24:34.757 --> 24:37.540
Yeah, well, this is school.
Right?

24:37.640 --> 24:39.382
All I'm saying is that,

24:39.482 --> 24:41.184
you know,
if you just relax a little

24:41.284 --> 24:44.307
and try to feel the music
in your heart,

24:44.407 --> 24:47.109
your piece will really soar.
- Like your commercial soared?

24:47.209 --> 24:48.751
Ooh!

24:48.851 --> 24:50.473
Oof.

24:50.573 --> 24:51.914
Dude.

24:52.014 --> 24:53.916
You know what?

24:54.016 --> 24:55.838
You're the one
who wanted my help.

24:55.938 --> 24:58.180
No, I--

25:03.025 --> 25:04.366
Nice one, Mr. Tucker.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.048
You really know
how to charm the ladies.

25:06.148 --> 25:09.231
-
- Thank you, Ethan.

25:12.194 --> 25:15.837
I was right.
He is so rude.

25:19.441 --> 25:22.263
I don't know why I'm doing this
if he's just gonna insult me.

25:22.363 --> 25:25.467
He probably didn't mean anything
by it, honey.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.388
Well, he basically
called me a sellout.

25:27.488 --> 25:31.813
Well, are you passionate about
those commercials you write?

25:33.254 --> 25:34.595
Not really.

25:34.695 --> 25:38.559
You're such a great singer
and songwriter.

25:38.659 --> 25:41.522
I don't know why you stopped!
Did something happen?

25:41.622 --> 25:44.045
Nothing happened,

25:44.145 --> 25:46.247
I just got busy with life,
that's all. You know?

25:46.347 --> 25:50.050
I'm an adult. It happens.

25:50.150 --> 25:52.152
It doesn't have to happen.

25:53.233 --> 25:55.736
Well, I'm just glad
tomorrow is Saturday.

25:55.836 --> 25:57.838
I'll be happy
not to see Travis.

26:14.694 --> 26:16.276
- Abby? Abby.
- Oh, no.

26:16.376 --> 26:18.838
- About yesterday.
- It's the weekend, Travis.

26:18.938 --> 26:20.400
I'm trying to do
some Christmas shopping?

26:20.500 --> 26:22.121
I know, I just thought maybe
I could buy you a coffee

26:22.221 --> 26:24.364
and apologise properly?
- That's really not necessary.

26:24.464 --> 26:25.365
Please?

26:27.146 --> 26:29.148
Fine.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.817
I didn't know
what you wanted,

26:37.917 --> 26:39.779
so I just sorta got
one of everything.

26:39.879 --> 26:41.500
Well, if you're trying
to bribe me with sugar,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.583
you're off to a good start.

26:44.683 --> 26:47.826
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

26:47.926 --> 26:49.988
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

26:50.088 --> 26:51.910
That's an understatement.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.272
I've just been
really overwhelmed

26:53.372 --> 26:55.073
with this whole
performance thing and um,

26:55.173 --> 26:57.375
I took it out on you
and I'm sorry.

26:58.537 --> 26:59.878
Whatever, it's fine.

26:59.978 --> 27:01.960
So we can start over?

27:02.060 --> 27:03.562
I'm Travis.

27:03.662 --> 27:05.483
I'm the music teacher
at Bellville High School.

27:05.583 --> 27:09.688
- Seriously?
- Just go with it.

27:09.788 --> 27:10.769
Hi, I'm Abby.

27:10.869 --> 27:12.410
Nice to meet you, Abby.

27:12.510 --> 27:13.892
My class has
a very important

27:13.992 --> 27:15.773
Christmas pageant performance
coming up.

27:15.873 --> 27:18.096
The whole department's kind of
counting on it going well,

27:18.196 --> 27:19.537
and I could really use
your help.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.818
What do you say?

27:20.918 --> 27:23.040
Travis, I've already agreed
to help.

27:24.362 --> 27:25.743
Fine!

27:25.843 --> 27:27.024
I would be happy to help.

27:27.124 --> 27:28.426
Thank you.

27:28.526 --> 27:29.667
And again, I'm, uh--

27:29.767 --> 27:32.890
I'm really sorry
that I insulted you.

27:33.891 --> 27:34.832
Apology accepted.

27:34.932 --> 27:36.554
'Cause really, um,

27:36.654 --> 27:38.515
I'm quite impressed by you,
actually.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.718
Really?

27:40.818 --> 27:42.800
Yeah, you're chasing
your dreams.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.361
You make a living
off songwriting!

27:44.461 --> 27:46.603
Right.

27:46.703 --> 27:47.804
Thanks.

27:47.904 --> 27:49.906
Truce?

27:50.947 --> 27:52.129
Truce.

27:52.229 --> 27:53.330
So, I'll see you there
on Monday.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.331
I'll be there.

27:54.431 --> 27:56.533
Perfect.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.935
So, your turn.

27:59.035 --> 28:01.097
All three.

28:01.197 --> 28:05.181
- Is that a part of the truce?
- Yummy.

28:18.374 --> 28:19.475
Okay, guys.
I wanna try something

28:19.575 --> 28:21.037
a little different today.

28:21.137 --> 28:22.758
Instead of practice
we have free period?

28:22.858 --> 28:24.800
No, Ethan. Not that.

28:24.900 --> 28:28.244
I got some logistical stuff I
gotta do for the performance,

28:28.344 --> 28:31.727
so, Abby is gonna take over
teaching today.

28:32.828 --> 28:33.969
What?

28:34.069 --> 28:35.090
Yeah, what?

28:36.592 --> 28:38.133
I think we could use
another perspective.

28:38.233 --> 28:40.896
We do want this performance
to be perfect, right?

28:40.996 --> 28:43.018
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I need to take over.

28:43.118 --> 28:45.300
Yeah, with all due respect,
Mr. Tucker,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.022
we don't have
that many practices left.

28:47.122 --> 28:49.424
We can't afford
to just waste time.

28:49.524 --> 28:50.826
It'll be great, okay?

28:50.926 --> 28:55.230
And I will be right over there,
so all of you...

28:55.330 --> 28:57.432
listen to what she says.

28:57.532 --> 28:59.534
Okay?

29:04.018 --> 29:05.960
Okay. Um--

29:06.060 --> 29:10.445
Well, now that I have
your attention...

29:10.545 --> 29:12.807
Let's see. Uh--

29:12.907 --> 29:17.752
Can anyone tell me what the
number one rule in music is?

29:19.433 --> 29:21.055
Come on, anybody.

29:21.155 --> 29:23.277
Um, what's the number one rule
in music?

29:25.319 --> 29:26.941
Yes, uh--

29:27.041 --> 29:27.982
Yeah, Lila.

29:28.082 --> 29:29.303
Tone?

29:29.403 --> 29:32.065
Tone? That's good.

29:32.165 --> 29:34.568
Uh, any other ideas?

29:38.652 --> 29:40.273
Yes.
- Pitch?

29:40.373 --> 29:42.556
Pitch, okay.

29:42.656 --> 29:43.837
That's also good.

29:43.937 --> 29:45.939
Anyone else?

29:49.943 --> 29:52.125
Uh, rhythm?

29:52.225 --> 29:54.127
Rhythm, all right.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.768
So, these are all
very important,

29:55.868 --> 29:59.892
but the number one rule in music
is there are no rules.

29:59.992 --> 30:03.656
What makes a great musician
is listening.

30:03.756 --> 30:05.458
Their ability to listen
is everything.

30:05.558 --> 30:08.461
And you need to listen
to what's around you, okay?

30:08.561 --> 30:10.182
You have two ears, one mouth,

30:10.282 --> 30:13.626
so you should be listening
twice as much as you're playing,

30:13.726 --> 30:16.509
and you should be having fun.

30:16.609 --> 30:19.551
But shouldn't we
practice the song?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.634
Well, you can practice
and have fun.

30:21.734 --> 30:23.675
There are many ways
of practicing and improving

30:23.775 --> 30:25.397
at the same time.
And, you know,

30:25.497 --> 30:28.440
one great way to practice
and have fun

30:28.540 --> 30:30.542
is to play with
your favourite songs.

30:32.104 --> 30:34.646
But we're not playing our
favourite song for the pageant.

30:34.746 --> 30:37.449
Yes, you're right.
You're not.

30:37.549 --> 30:39.211
But still great ear training.

30:39.311 --> 30:42.133
And you need to train your ears
so you can trust your ears

30:42.233 --> 30:44.616
and train your ears
to trust your intuition.

30:44.716 --> 30:47.859
And that will make
the difference

30:47.959 --> 30:50.261
between a bad performance
and a great performance.

30:50.361 --> 30:52.063
That all sounds cool,

30:52.163 --> 30:53.905
but I don't see
how we can do all of that

30:54.005 --> 30:56.467
in time to get the perfect song
for the performance.

30:56.567 --> 30:58.790
Well, it doesn't need
to be perfect.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.312
You just need to make
the audience feel something.

31:01.412 --> 31:03.514
Okay?

31:03.614 --> 31:04.875
So, let's give it a try.

31:04.975 --> 31:09.600
And a-one, a-two,
a-one, two, three, and--

31:12.983 --> 31:14.985
Feel the music!

31:18.949 --> 31:20.951
Close your eyes
if you need to.

32:04.713 --> 32:06.375
Excellent!
Yes, guys. Yes!

32:06.475 --> 32:08.657
That's what we're talking about.
That was awesome!

32:08.757 --> 32:10.339
Living in the moment.

32:10.439 --> 32:13.282
Feeling the music!

32:21.490 --> 32:24.152
Hey, Abby.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:24.252 --> 32:25.874
Hey.
- Hey, Travis.

32:25.974 --> 32:27.836
What do you say
we have lunch together?

32:27.936 --> 32:30.879
I-- it's Caputo's.
- You got me.

32:33.061 --> 32:36.524
And you bought coffee too!

32:36.624 --> 32:40.928
Can we talk about
how you were a natural back there?

32:41.028 --> 32:44.052
What were you,
a teacher in a past life?

32:44.152 --> 32:46.654
I actually used to give
music lessons on the side

32:46.754 --> 32:48.536
when I was in college.

32:48.636 --> 32:52.620
I really loved it, actually.
- Yeah, I-- it shows.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.143
So, how are
the commercials going?

32:56.243 --> 32:58.265
You don't really care
about those, do you?

32:58.365 --> 33:01.068
Um, I mean, I do.

33:01.168 --> 33:03.390
It's just, uh,

33:03.490 --> 33:06.473
I guess,
what I really wanna hear

33:06.573 --> 33:09.236
is something that you've written
that you care about.

33:09.336 --> 33:11.959
Well, there's this one Christmas
song I've been toying with.

33:12.059 --> 33:14.521
But--
- Okay! Well, there you go.

33:14.621 --> 33:17.023
Sing it for me!

33:20.707 --> 33:21.968
Okay. Um--

33:22.068 --> 33:25.672
♪ Silent night
filled with music now ♪

33:27.433 --> 33:32.378
♪ And each moment's like
a Christmas wish come true ♪

33:32.478 --> 33:35.421
♪ Even though
choirs are singin' ♪

33:35.521 --> 33:37.704
♪ Their songs
of joy and praise ♪

33:37.804 --> 33:42.288
♪ My favourite
Christmas Melody is you ♪

33:43.689 --> 33:44.710
Wha?

33:44.810 --> 33:47.393
Abby, that was beautiful.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.315
I want, you know, just a little
bit more time to work on it.

33:49.415 --> 33:51.076
I just haven't gotten to it.

33:51.176 --> 33:54.159
I've been so busy serenading
people with-- sandwich bags.

33:55.581 --> 33:57.803
Well,
I think you need to make time,

33:57.903 --> 34:00.085
because it's really great.

34:00.185 --> 34:01.246
I mean, I'm impressed.

34:01.346 --> 34:02.808
- Oh, please.
- I'm impressed!

34:02.908 --> 34:06.732
- Well, I don't know. Whatever.
- I'm serious!

34:06.832 --> 34:09.134
You get paid
for writing songs.

34:09.234 --> 34:12.337
It's a lot more
than I've ever done.

34:12.437 --> 34:16.661
I used to have a-- a dream
of being a composer, but--

34:16.761 --> 34:18.623
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.864
But I never swung for it.

34:19.964 --> 34:22.066
It always seemed
like too much of a risk.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.068
Well, it is a lot of work,

34:24.168 --> 34:26.170
but it's never too late
to reach for your dreams.

34:28.853 --> 34:30.855
No. No.

34:32.256 --> 34:36.040
Well, I'm not exactly pursuing
my real dreams either, you know?

34:36.140 --> 34:37.842
Well, what are
your real dreams?

34:37.942 --> 34:39.363
To be a musical artist.

34:39.463 --> 34:43.247
To sing Christmas songs
like the one I just showed you.

34:43.347 --> 34:46.690
Okay, I love that!
Why aren't you doing that?

34:46.790 --> 34:49.213
Well,
my official excuse is work.

34:49.313 --> 34:53.217
But, honestly, I just haven't
been really inspired lately.

34:53.317 --> 34:55.699
I only have that one verse.

34:55.799 --> 34:57.801
Well, what's holding you back?

34:58.802 --> 34:59.903
I'm not sure.

35:00.003 --> 35:01.345
I just thought
coming back here

35:01.445 --> 35:04.828
would spark
or light a fire under me,

35:04.928 --> 35:06.309
get that
Christmas spirit back.

35:06.409 --> 35:08.632
It's just--
nothing's worked so far.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.715
Okay, I see now.

35:11.815 --> 35:13.957
You just need
a little Christmas cheer.

35:14.057 --> 35:15.598
Something like that.

35:15.698 --> 35:18.801
Well then...it's a good thing
that we're hanging out

35:18.901 --> 35:20.683
because I don't know
if anyone told you

35:20.783 --> 35:23.126
but I'm kinda like the king
of Christmas around this town.

35:23.226 --> 35:26.449
- The king of Christmas, huh?
- Oh yeah, big time.

35:26.549 --> 35:28.891
That's a pretty big statement

35:28.991 --> 35:30.253
considering you live
in Bellville.

35:30.353 --> 35:31.734
Yeah.

35:31.834 --> 35:33.496
We are like "the" capital
of Christmas here.

35:33.596 --> 35:36.018
- Mm-hm.
- You're not even from here.

35:36.118 --> 35:38.420
Well, why do you think
I moved here?

35:38.520 --> 35:41.303
I thought you moved here
for your dad.

35:41.403 --> 35:43.025
Well, no, I did.
You're right.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.607
But I mean, the Christmas thing
was a huge draw!

35:46.929 --> 35:49.471
You know what?

35:49.571 --> 35:52.154
I am gonna make it
my personal mission

35:52.254 --> 35:53.715
to help you get back
your Christmas spirit.

35:53.815 --> 35:54.756
- What?
- Yeah.

35:54.856 --> 35:56.398
Why?

35:56.498 --> 35:59.060
Well, take it as a thank you
for helping me with class.

36:00.542 --> 36:02.764
And how exactly
are you gonna do that?

36:05.186 --> 36:07.449
I'm not sure yet.

36:07.549 --> 36:10.091
But I will do it.
You just wait and see.

36:10.191 --> 36:12.553
Whatever you say.

36:23.244 --> 36:27.228
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mom. What's all this?

36:27.328 --> 36:29.870
I'm stringing garland to help
decorate for the tree ceremony.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.552
You wanna help?

36:31.652 --> 36:33.954
Oh, I'd love to but I was just
about to get back to work.

36:34.054 --> 36:34.955
Oh, okay.

36:35.055 --> 36:37.057
That's okay, baby.

36:39.379 --> 36:40.401
You know what?

36:40.501 --> 36:43.143
I can take a break.
- Yay!

36:44.945 --> 36:46.647
So, how are the kids sounding,
co-director?

36:46.747 --> 36:48.649
Temporary co-director.

36:48.749 --> 36:52.292
I'm just saying, you'd fit in
really well around here.

36:52.392 --> 36:53.773
I like having you home,
honey.

36:53.873 --> 36:55.875
I like being home, Mom.

36:57.717 --> 37:00.100
Is this butter?

37:00.200 --> 37:02.882
Stop eating the decorations!

37:05.485 --> 37:07.146
Remember what Abby taught you.

37:07.246 --> 37:10.950
Listen to what's being played
and feel the music.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.218
Very, very nice, guys!

37:40.318 --> 37:42.100
I really feel
like Abby's suggestions

37:42.200 --> 37:43.742
really helped out on that one.
What do you think?

37:43.842 --> 37:45.103
- It was amazing.
- Right?

37:45.203 --> 37:46.104
Oh, yeah.

37:46.204 --> 37:48.066
But Ethan, bud!

37:48.166 --> 37:50.028
You look bored to tears!

37:52.370 --> 37:56.154
We want to show
the superintendent passion.

37:56.254 --> 37:59.597
There must be something
about music that you like.

37:59.697 --> 38:01.639
Have you tried
any other instruments?

38:01.739 --> 38:03.401
The pageant is next week.

38:03.501 --> 38:05.403
We don't have time to be adding
new instruments into the mix.

38:05.503 --> 38:07.885
Okay, well, wait.
I mean, Abby could be right.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.647
Maybe it'll make
the performance better.

38:09.747 --> 38:11.369
We won't know
until we try.

38:11.469 --> 38:13.371
Well, are there any other
instruments that you wanna try

38:13.471 --> 38:15.693
or others that you played
and actually liked?

38:15.793 --> 38:18.315
I mean, I've played
a little piano before.

38:20.077 --> 38:22.199
Okay, great!
Uh, show us what you got.

38:32.329 --> 38:34.851
It's okay.
Just play what you can.

39:31.226 --> 39:34.329
Ethan,
you can play the piano!

39:34.429 --> 39:35.811
A little bit.

39:35.911 --> 39:38.293
What?! Are you--

39:38.393 --> 39:39.694
That's incredible!

39:39.794 --> 39:41.336
Why didn't you tell me
you could do that?

39:41.436 --> 39:43.898
I don't know! I guess
I never really thought of it.

39:43.998 --> 39:45.300
Um--

39:45.400 --> 39:46.861
I just didn't see the point.

39:46.961 --> 39:49.103
It's not like I'm gonna
do anything with it anyway.

39:49.203 --> 39:50.705
Why would you think that?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.387
I already know
what I'm doing with my life.

39:52.487 --> 39:54.188
I'm taking over
my family's restaurant.

39:54.288 --> 39:56.751
There's no reason
you can't do both.

39:56.851 --> 39:58.553
Just seems like a waste of time,
I guess.

39:58.653 --> 40:01.115
I have to do cooking classes,
business courses.

40:01.215 --> 40:03.077
You have to play
in the Christmas pageant.

40:03.177 --> 40:04.919
Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:05.019 --> 40:07.882
You won't have to
play triangle anymore.

40:07.982 --> 40:09.984
Deal.

40:12.306 --> 40:14.308
Wow.

40:15.429 --> 40:17.851
I swear, these kids
surprise me every day.

40:17.951 --> 40:19.293
No kidding.

40:19.393 --> 40:21.935
So I was thinking, uh,
what are you doing tonight?

40:22.035 --> 40:23.256
Tonight?

40:23.356 --> 40:24.738
Nothing. Why?

40:24.838 --> 40:26.139
Well, I did promise
that I would help you

40:26.239 --> 40:27.661
get your
Christmas spirit back,

40:27.761 --> 40:29.703
and the music room
is missing a Christmas tree.

40:29.803 --> 40:32.425
Ah! You wanna decorate
a Christmas tree together?

40:32.525 --> 40:34.267
Yeah, why not?
I mean, the kids'll love it

40:34.367 --> 40:37.070
and I'm assuming you haven't
done one this year yet?

40:37.170 --> 40:38.431
Try five years.

40:38.531 --> 40:41.154
All the more reason!
So, what do you say?

40:41.254 --> 40:43.756
Music room at 7:00?
- Okay. Let's do it.

40:43.856 --> 40:45.858
Okay.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.649
Ooh, is this a date?

40:56.749 --> 40:58.050
What? No!

40:58.150 --> 41:00.773
It's just a Christmas thing.

41:00.873 --> 41:02.895
Enjoying the season
or whatever.

41:02.995 --> 41:05.057
It just seems like
the two of you

41:05.157 --> 41:06.578
decorating a tree
alone at night,

41:06.678 --> 41:08.380
it kinda seems
like a date to me.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.622
- Well, it's not.
- Oh.

41:10.722 --> 41:12.865
He is single.
And kinda handsome?

41:12.965 --> 41:16.268
You want me to start hounding
you about your love life?

41:16.368 --> 41:18.610
- Absolutely not.
- Thank you.

41:20.332 --> 41:25.156
Bye, Mom. Love you!
- Love you, sweetheart.

41:25.256 --> 41:28.239

The song is fine, I just--

42:40.730 --> 42:42.351
No, no, it's cool.

42:42.451 --> 42:44.754
I'd uh-- I'd lash out too
if I had to listen to me sing.

Maybe we need
a cookie break.

You know,
get my blood sugar up.

42:48.777 --> 42:51.840

- All right. Yeah.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.842
Hey, did you bring any of your
mother's ginger snap cookies?

42:53.942 --> 42:55.444
You bet I did.

42:55.544 --> 42:57.606
Oh, I think
you just saved Christmas.

42:57.706 --> 43:00.649
I may or may not have some
hot cider stashed around here.

43:00.749 --> 43:04.413
- Ooh, you just levelled up!
- Come on.

43:04.513 --> 43:06.515
Phew.

43:07.756 --> 43:10.298
- Here you are,
your cider, Madam.

43:10.398 --> 43:12.420
- Thanks.
- It's hot.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.462
So, you've been
holding out on me.

43:14.562 --> 43:15.463
What do you mean?

43:15.563 --> 43:16.665
You can sing.

43:16.765 --> 43:18.026
Ah-ho!

43:18.126 --> 43:19.667
I thought you said
you were a composer.

43:19.767 --> 43:21.889
Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

43:24.052 --> 43:26.074
I actually wrote a verse
for that Christmas song

43:26.174 --> 43:27.235
that you showed me
the other day.

43:27.335 --> 43:29.277
I hope I'm not imposing.

43:29.377 --> 43:30.678
No way!

43:30.778 --> 43:33.040
Of course not.
- Well, I'm not as good as you.

43:33.140 --> 43:35.243
I should probably just leave it
to the professionals.

43:35.343 --> 43:37.445
Don't be silly.

43:37.545 --> 43:38.846
I'd love to hear it sometime.

43:38.946 --> 43:40.948
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:42.550 --> 43:44.551
How 'bout now?

43:52.079 --> 43:54.741
All right, I'm uh--

43:54.841 --> 43:58.585
a little nervous
showing you this,

43:58.685 --> 44:00.867
but uh, I mean, it's probably
gonna be terrible.

44:00.967 --> 44:02.969
Play it for me!

44:04.090 --> 44:05.272
All right.

44:33.519 --> 44:35.501
I know it's your song,

44:35.601 --> 44:38.184
and I don't wanna edge in
on your creativity, I just--

44:38.284 --> 44:39.825
you said you were stuck
and I thought maybe

44:39.925 --> 44:41.927
some additional lyrics
might help to spark something.

44:44.610 --> 44:46.111
Well.

44:46.211 --> 44:49.815
"With the fire here before us
and winter's quiet hum."

44:51.136 --> 44:52.557
That's poetry.

44:52.657 --> 44:55.520
I love it.
- Really? You like it?

44:55.620 --> 44:58.043
No, I love it.

44:58.143 --> 45:01.766
You know, you keep trying to
put yourself in the background

45:01.866 --> 45:04.089
but you really deserve
to be in the spotlight.

45:04.189 --> 45:06.951
I could say the same
about you.

45:14.318 --> 45:16.381
I wrote
"Christmas Without You".

45:16.481 --> 45:17.862
I'm sorry?

45:17.962 --> 45:20.144
That Casey Macey song?

45:20.244 --> 45:22.386
That's why I reacted
the way I did

45:22.486 --> 45:23.868
when we were
decorating the tree.

45:23.968 --> 45:26.630
What do you mean, you wrote--

45:26.730 --> 45:28.833
I mean, that would be amazing.
It's a super big hit.

45:28.933 --> 45:31.275
Well, for her it was.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.637
She heard me sing it
at a showcase.

45:33.737 --> 45:35.959
She even said she wanted
to collaborate with me

45:36.059 --> 45:40.124
and then she decided that she
really didn't need me after all.

45:40.224 --> 45:42.326
Are you saying
that she stole it?

45:42.426 --> 45:44.448
I couldn't really prove it.

45:44.548 --> 45:47.531
My manager
hired a lawyer and--

45:48.992 --> 45:50.373
--just,
she said there was nothing

45:50.473 --> 45:52.055
that we could even do
about it legally

45:52.155 --> 45:53.777
because of
the copyright laws.

45:57.881 --> 46:00.503
I mean, it's no wonder
you lost your inspiration.

46:00.603 --> 46:03.086
That's horrible. I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

46:05.568 --> 46:08.031
You know, I've never
told anyone that story before.

46:08.131 --> 46:10.633
Well,
your secret's safe with me.

46:10.733 --> 46:12.915
Thanks.

46:13.015 --> 46:16.399
Well, this new song,
it just needs a chorus

46:16.499 --> 46:19.402
and I was thinking maybe
you could write it with me.

46:19.502 --> 46:20.963
Really?

46:21.063 --> 46:22.645
Yeah!

46:22.745 --> 46:23.966
I'd love that, yeah!

46:24.066 --> 46:25.768
Um, I mean,
I'm free tomorrow.

46:25.868 --> 46:28.611
I mean, unless you have a date
or something like that.

46:28.711 --> 46:30.973
Oh no, I don't.
But if you do--

46:31.073 --> 46:33.075
I don't.

46:40.322 --> 46:43.665
Uh, it's getting pretty late.

46:43.765 --> 46:45.267
So--

46:45.367 --> 46:47.589
we probably better get going.

46:47.689 --> 46:49.511
Yeah. No, it is late.

46:49.611 --> 46:51.633
Yeah.

46:51.733 --> 46:53.735
Yeah.

47:42.342 --> 47:44.344
You guys are killin' it!

47:48.988 --> 47:51.130
Not this. Not this.

47:51.230 --> 47:53.493
Definitely not this.

47:53.593 --> 47:56.696
I have nothing to wear.

47:56.796 --> 47:58.818
I thought you were just
writing a song together.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.460
What does it matter
what you wear?

48:00.560 --> 48:03.182
It doesn't. I just don't wanna
look bad, you know?

48:03.282 --> 48:05.865
Mm-hm. You like him.

48:05.965 --> 48:07.787
What? No.

48:07.887 --> 48:08.868
Don't lie to me.

48:08.968 --> 48:09.869
Whitney.

48:09.969 --> 48:11.590
Abby.

48:13.772 --> 48:15.814
He's here. I gotta go.

48:20.459 --> 48:23.562
Hey.

48:23.662 --> 48:26.164
Hi.

48:26.264 --> 48:28.266
I brought these.

48:29.027 --> 48:31.029
You brought me flowers?

48:32.150 --> 48:33.852
Um, they're for your mom,
actually.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.533
Oh.

48:35.633 --> 48:38.136
Did I hear "flowers"?

48:38.236 --> 48:40.819
They're beautiful,
Travis. Thank you.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.700
If you'll excuse me,

48:42.800 --> 48:45.623
I have about a billion cookies
to cook for this weekend.

48:45.723 --> 48:46.864
You want some help?

48:46.964 --> 48:49.067
I thought you guys
were writing.

48:49.167 --> 48:50.748
No reason we can't do both!

48:50.848 --> 48:54.051
Oh, well, I'd love the help,
honey. Thank you.

49:01.779 --> 49:04.562
Sorry this isn't the easiest way
to write a song.

49:04.662 --> 49:07.004
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
it'll be an innovative new way

49:07.104 --> 49:09.106
of unleashing
our creativity.

49:10.507 --> 49:14.731
It feels like old times
and I'm a giddy child.

49:18.315 --> 49:19.536
Wait, that sounds good.

49:19.636 --> 49:22.579
Let's remember that.
- Hmm.

49:22.679 --> 49:24.701
Or maybe something like--

49:24.801 --> 49:27.203

49:47.823 --> 49:49.365
And then
we slide up like this.

49:49.465 --> 49:50.446
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:50.546 --> 49:52.868
- All right. Well, uh...

- Ah, it's so good.

51:09.983 --> 51:11.485
I think
we should send it out.

51:11.585 --> 51:12.886
What, like to labels?

51:12.986 --> 51:14.367
Yeah, is that crazy?

51:14.467 --> 51:17.611
I think it's too good
to keep to ourselves.

51:17.711 --> 51:19.212
I have a friend
that I went to high school with

51:19.312 --> 51:20.453
who works at
a management company.

51:20.553 --> 51:22.095
I-- I could reach out.

51:22.195 --> 51:24.057
Maybe we should send it
through my agent Brenda.

51:24.157 --> 51:25.378
It'll be more official.

51:25.478 --> 51:27.480
Perfect.

51:28.121 --> 51:29.422
Yeah.

51:29.522 --> 51:32.745
Let me know your thoughts.

51:32.845 --> 51:34.867
Think we have a winner.

51:36.128 --> 51:37.550
There. Sent.

51:37.650 --> 51:39.071
Wow. Oh!

51:39.171 --> 51:41.113
I CC'ed you, so you have a copy
of the recording too.

51:41.213 --> 51:43.215
Awesome.

51:44.657 --> 51:46.238
What if she doesn't like it?

51:46.338 --> 51:49.642
How could she not like it?
It's objectively incredible.

51:49.742 --> 51:51.644
Is it?

51:51.744 --> 51:55.768
Look,
even if she doesn't like it,

51:55.868 --> 51:59.051
you're still more impressive
than 99% of the people out there

51:59.151 --> 52:01.533
that don't have the guts
to follow their dreams!

52:01.633 --> 52:03.855
And we made an amazing song.

52:03.955 --> 52:08.099
So no matter what,
we always have this.

52:08.199 --> 52:10.502
You're right.

52:10.602 --> 52:13.425
Besides, there's no way
she won't love it!

52:13.525 --> 52:15.427
Oh, I can't wait for us
to get in the studio

52:15.527 --> 52:17.348
and record this next
big Christmas hit!

52:17.448 --> 52:19.450
Right? I--

52:19.811 --> 52:20.792
"Us"?

52:20.892 --> 52:23.074
Yeah, you're my partner,
right?

52:23.174 --> 52:25.276
Partner?

52:25.376 --> 52:29.600
I mean...yeah.

52:29.700 --> 52:31.702
Partner.

52:32.463 --> 52:34.465
Yeah!

52:37.188 --> 52:40.571
Ooh, I just love
that song you were singing.

52:40.671 --> 52:43.794
You two work well together.

52:53.724 --> 52:56.066
Guys, we are lookin' so good
for this performance!

52:56.166 --> 52:57.467
I wanna mix it up
a little bit.

52:57.567 --> 52:59.229
Don't you think
we should keep practicing?

52:59.329 --> 53:00.470
The pageant's in three days!

53:00.570 --> 53:02.432
We've practiced enough.

53:02.532 --> 53:05.075
I want us to loosen up
and have some fun.

53:05.175 --> 53:07.197
Said no winner ever.

53:10.139 --> 53:12.762
All right,
we're gonna try a new song.

53:12.862 --> 53:15.245
It's called
"A Christmas Melody"

53:15.345 --> 53:17.246
and Abby and I wrote it.

53:18.508 --> 53:19.409
You guys wrote this?

53:19.509 --> 53:20.490
- Mm-hm.
Cool.

53:20.590 --> 53:22.932
Oh, yeah.

53:23.032 --> 53:24.534
So, you can
take one yourselves

53:24.634 --> 53:26.656
and pass one
to the row behind you.

53:26.756 --> 53:28.377
Sorry the sheet music
is handwritten

53:28.477 --> 53:32.501
but take it home,
give it a try.

53:34.363 --> 53:37.746
Okay. Your homework
is to practice this new piece

53:37.846 --> 53:39.708
and we'll take a look at it
next week, all right?

53:39.808 --> 53:41.590
Okay, thank you!
Thank you, Sir.

53:49.458 --> 53:52.000
- So, had an idea.
- What's that?

53:52.100 --> 53:53.482
Gingerbread houses.

53:53.582 --> 53:54.843
Mmm.

53:54.943 --> 53:56.645
I found some kits
in my mom's pantry.

53:56.745 --> 53:58.887
I like
where your head's at.

53:58.987 --> 54:00.809
So, this evening?
Uh, my house?

54:00.909 --> 54:02.370
I'll be there.

54:02.470 --> 54:04.472
Cool.

54:08.156 --> 54:10.598
- Good work, everybody.
- Thank you.

54:11.919 --> 54:13.921
Bye.
Bye.

54:19.407 --> 54:21.068
Oh, Ethan.
Hold back a sec.

54:21.168 --> 54:23.591
What up, Mr. Tucker?
I've been thinkin'.

54:23.691 --> 54:26.754
I think you should apply
to the Powell School of Music.

54:26.854 --> 54:28.395
The one in New York?

54:28.495 --> 54:29.797
Isn't that like,
really hard to get into?

54:29.897 --> 54:31.599
Yeah, but I know
the admissions coordinator.

54:31.699 --> 54:33.480
I can put in a good word.

54:33.580 --> 54:35.442
Look, I'm not going to college.
I told you.

54:35.542 --> 54:36.844
I'm taking over
my family's restaurant.

54:36.944 --> 54:39.446
And that's a very noble plan,
Ethan.

54:39.546 --> 54:41.808
Look, I've been there.
It's delicious.

54:41.908 --> 54:43.370
But is that really
what you want?

54:43.470 --> 54:46.333
I mean, is playing the piano
even a career?

54:46.433 --> 54:47.734
Absolutely.

54:47.834 --> 54:50.297
I mean, you could play
in an orchestra.

54:50.397 --> 54:51.978
You could score films.

54:52.078 --> 54:53.540
You could work
as a session musician.

54:53.640 --> 54:56.663
You could even do commercials
like Miss Walker.

54:56.763 --> 54:58.765
Uh, I don't know.

54:59.566 --> 55:02.268
Ethan,
you are so talented, okay?

55:02.368 --> 55:04.470
You can't waste that
in the back of a kitchen!

55:04.570 --> 55:07.673
I mean, it would be pretty cool
to play music for a living.

55:07.773 --> 55:10.556
Right?
All I'm asking is you apply.

55:10.656 --> 55:11.998
Okay? You just make
the audition tape

55:12.098 --> 55:13.759
and you can decide
if you wanna go later.

55:13.859 --> 55:16.322
If I make a tape,
will you stop bugging me?

55:16.422 --> 55:18.684
Never.

55:18.784 --> 55:20.646
I will never stop pushing you.

55:20.746 --> 55:22.248
Fine.

55:22.348 --> 55:23.849
All right! Good. Let's go.

55:23.949 --> 55:25.451
- Right now?
- Yeah!

55:25.551 --> 55:27.553
No time like the present.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.462
So, what do you think,
"Deck the Halls"?

55:37.562 --> 55:39.624
I mean,
it's not very original.

55:39.724 --> 55:40.986
Can I do you
and Mrs. Walker's song-

55:41.086 --> 55:43.088
"A Christmas Melody"?

55:44.529 --> 55:46.531
I'd be honoured.

56:04.068 --> 56:06.490
Brenda! What did you think
about the song?

56:06.590 --> 56:09.614
Yeah, Abby, about the song.
What is this?

56:09.714 --> 56:12.296
Did you like it?
I have a new musical partner.

56:12.396 --> 56:13.938
Abby,
it's a Christmas song.

56:14.038 --> 56:15.820
Christmas is
a very competitive market.

56:15.920 --> 56:18.342
I know, but the song
is really good,

56:18.442 --> 56:20.304
so I think it'll stand out.
- Sure.

56:20.404 --> 56:24.068
I'll send it out, see if
there are any takers. I just--

56:24.168 --> 56:26.109
I don't know why you're wasting
your time with all this stuff.

56:26.209 --> 56:27.791
It's not a waste of time,
it's--

56:27.891 --> 56:29.473
How are the commercials
coming along?

56:29.573 --> 56:31.555
I have a ton more corporate gigs
you should be working on.

56:31.655 --> 56:34.478
McKayla, email Abby
the corporate gigs.

56:34.578 --> 56:37.481
You know, I was thinking maybe
I should put a pause on those.

56:37.581 --> 56:40.403
What? Are you crazy?

56:40.503 --> 56:44.327
I'm feeling really inspired
with my own songs right now.

56:44.427 --> 56:47.010
I may even start
performing again.

56:47.110 --> 56:50.093
Abby, you're at the top
of your game.

56:50.193 --> 56:53.216
If you quit now, someone will
come in and take up your spot.

56:53.316 --> 56:55.778
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

56:55.878 --> 56:59.782
Okay. All right, just--
don't say I didn't warn you.

56:59.882 --> 57:01.103
I won't.

57:01.203 --> 57:03.306
Thanks, Brenda!

57:03.406 --> 57:05.428
I know you just want
what's best for me.

57:05.528 --> 57:07.069
Uh-huh. Sure.

57:07.169 --> 57:09.531
Okay, bye!

57:18.180 --> 57:20.302
I feel like I need
more sprinkles.

57:22.944 --> 57:25.807
Ooh. I'm missing a gumdrop.

57:25.907 --> 57:27.169
I don't have
any of those left,

57:27.269 --> 57:29.571
but I do have a candy cane
I can spare.

57:29.671 --> 57:31.092
- I'll take that.
- No.

57:31.192 --> 57:33.855
I need
those jellybeans first.

57:33.955 --> 57:36.738
You drive a hard bargain,
Travis Tucker, but a fair one.

57:36.838 --> 57:38.660
There we go.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.062
Oh, by the way,
I spoke to Brenda

57:41.162 --> 57:42.263
and she's gonna
send the song out.

57:42.363 --> 57:44.425
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

57:44.525 --> 57:46.107
Things are happening.

57:46.207 --> 57:49.030
And I quit the commercials.
I thought you should know.

57:49.130 --> 57:51.512
- You did?
- Yeah.

57:51.612 --> 57:54.755
I wanna focus on singing
more Christmas songs with you.

57:54.855 --> 57:56.717
I personally think
we make a great duo.

57:56.817 --> 57:59.040
I do too.

57:59.140 --> 58:02.443
And, since I have
a little time on my hands,

58:02.543 --> 58:04.285
I was thinking
I could stick around

58:04.385 --> 58:05.646
for a few more weeks
in Bellville.

58:05.746 --> 58:07.688
Well, that's great!

58:07.788 --> 58:09.810
I mean,
we could write another song.

58:09.910 --> 58:11.331
Maybe we could try
to perform at a coffee shop

58:11.431 --> 58:12.613
or something like that?

58:12.713 --> 58:15.255
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

58:17.557 --> 58:20.300
Um...shoot.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.742
I should take this.

58:21.842 --> 58:23.463
Take it in my room.

58:23.563 --> 58:24.945
I'll make us
some hot toddies.

58:25.045 --> 58:27.047
Okay, thank you.

58:43.783 --> 58:47.527
The song's
called "A Christmas Melody".

58:47.627 --> 58:48.728
It's amazing, okay?

58:48.828 --> 58:50.049
You're not gonna
believe your ears.

58:50.149 --> 58:52.351
No, I swear.

58:54.313 --> 58:56.215
No, I have it
on my phone right now.

58:56.315 --> 58:58.337
We already submitted it
through more official channels

58:58.437 --> 59:01.520
but, if you want, I could
send it to you right now.

59:03.122 --> 59:05.064
Okay.

59:05.164 --> 59:07.486
Yeah. Just a sec.

59:13.291 --> 59:15.754
Okay, it should be
in your inbox now.

59:15.854 --> 59:17.996
Thanks. I mean,
this could have a big impact

59:18.096 --> 59:20.318
and I really appreciate
you giving it a listen.

59:20.418 --> 59:22.080
Oh, um,

59:22.180 --> 59:25.483
do me a favor
and just keep this between us.

59:25.583 --> 59:28.406
You know, I don't want anyone
to know that I did this.

59:28.506 --> 59:31.129
Well,
you know how people are.

59:31.229 --> 59:33.851
Especially musicians,
yeah.

59:33.951 --> 59:35.733
No.

59:35.833 --> 59:37.835
Hey, thanks again.

59:59.256 --> 1:00:00.637
All right,
hot toddy time!

1:00:00.737 --> 1:00:02.779
I think you should leave.

1:00:04.821 --> 1:00:06.403
I thought we were doing
gingerbread houses.

1:00:06.503 --> 1:00:09.025
Mine's finished.
Goodbye, Travis.

1:00:12.629 --> 1:00:14.631
Are-- are you for real?

1:00:19.996 --> 1:00:22.959
Okay. If that's what you want,
I guess I'll see you in school.

1:00:32.488 --> 1:00:34.710
I can't believe
this is happening again!

1:00:34.810 --> 1:00:38.554
This is exactly the reason
why I left the business.

1:00:38.654 --> 1:00:41.197
People are just so ruthless
when it comes to getting ahead.

1:00:41.297 --> 1:00:43.159
Even people in Bellville,
I guess.

1:00:43.259 --> 1:00:45.241
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry he did that to you.

1:00:45.341 --> 1:00:46.762
What a jerk.

1:00:46.862 --> 1:00:48.964
Who woulda thought?
- I wanna come back to New York.

1:00:49.064 --> 1:00:51.326
But what about your mom?

1:00:51.426 --> 1:00:53.428
Isn't this performance
important for her?

1:00:54.389 --> 1:00:55.571
Yeah.

1:00:55.671 --> 1:00:57.933
Her school arts funding
depends on it.

1:00:58.033 --> 1:01:00.696
- Then you can't leave, right?
- No.

1:01:00.796 --> 1:01:03.378
Ugh! I'm just so mad!

1:01:03.478 --> 1:01:06.902
Okay. You are gonna
get it out tonight.

1:01:07.002 --> 1:01:08.904
Channel it into a song
and tomorrow,

1:01:09.004 --> 1:01:10.585
you are gonna
pull yourself together

1:01:10.685 --> 1:01:13.028
and you are gonna move on.

1:01:13.128 --> 1:01:15.129
You got this, babe.

1:01:16.331 --> 1:01:18.593
I know.
Thanks, Whitney.

1:01:18.693 --> 1:01:21.396
You sure
you're gonna be okay?

1:01:21.496 --> 1:01:23.358
Yeah.

1:01:23.458 --> 1:01:26.000
I just really liked him,
that's all.

1:01:26.100 --> 1:01:28.883
I know you did. Goodnight, babe.

1:01:28.983 --> 1:01:31.185
Thanks again. Bye.

Just work stuff.

1:02:24.997 --> 1:02:28.421
Okay, well, I'm making Christmas
fudge for the pageant

1:02:28.521 --> 1:02:30.983
if you wanna help?
Might make you feel better.

1:02:31.083 --> 1:02:34.827

1:02:34.927 --> 1:02:37.509

the Christmas fudge mood.

♪ And your jokes are bad too ♪

1:03:10.601 --> 1:03:12.343
Abby.
Abby, where have you been?

1:03:12.443 --> 1:03:13.744
I've been calling you nonstop.

1:03:13.844 --> 1:03:16.307
Well, I only came here
to drop this off.

1:03:16.407 --> 1:03:19.110
You left it at my place.

1:03:19.210 --> 1:03:20.271
Wait,
what's going on with you?

1:03:20.371 --> 1:03:21.672
Hey, Miss Walker.

1:03:21.772 --> 1:03:23.834
Uh, we didn't see you
at practice today.

1:03:23.934 --> 1:03:25.156
Everyone missed you.

1:03:25.256 --> 1:03:26.917
I'm sorry, Ethan.
Something came up.

1:03:27.017 --> 1:03:28.559
But don't worry,

1:03:28.659 --> 1:03:30.601
I'll be there tomorrow
at the tree lighting ceremony.

1:03:30.701 --> 1:03:33.524
I wouldn't miss your big debut
for the world.

1:03:33.624 --> 1:03:35.285
Do you have any tips
about stage fright?

1:03:35.385 --> 1:03:36.647
I didn't think
I'd get this nervous.

1:03:36.747 --> 1:03:38.208
Oh, you'll do great!

1:03:38.308 --> 1:03:40.250
But if you do get a little
nervous, just, you know,

1:03:40.350 --> 1:03:43.894
close your eyes like I said
and get lost in the music.

1:03:43.994 --> 1:03:45.495
It always works for me.

1:03:45.595 --> 1:03:47.537
Okay, thanks.
I'll try it.

1:03:47.637 --> 1:03:50.140
See you later, Miss Walker.
- See you soon!

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:52.242
Okay, wait. Abby!

1:04:00.209 --> 1:04:02.672
Brenda! Uh, did someone
respond to the song?

1:04:02.772 --> 1:04:06.035
Actually,
it's me, McKayla.

1:04:06.135 --> 1:04:08.598
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

1:04:08.698 --> 1:04:10.680
Oh, hey, McKayla. What's up?

1:04:10.780 --> 1:04:11.921
Abby,
I just thought you should--

1:04:12.021 --> 1:04:13.763
Is that Abby?

1:04:13.863 --> 1:04:15.324
Abby,
I'm so glad you called.

1:04:15.424 --> 1:04:16.966
Uh, you called me.

1:04:17.066 --> 1:04:19.488
So, I sent your song out

1:04:19.588 --> 1:04:21.570
and usually we hear back
within a day,

1:04:21.670 --> 1:04:24.013
but no one's interested
so far.

1:04:24.113 --> 1:04:26.255
I'm so sorry, Abby.
- Oh.

1:04:26.355 --> 1:04:29.658
But the corporate gigs are still
available if you're interested.

1:04:29.758 --> 1:04:31.620
They really want you back,
Abby.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:33.582
They said
they'll double your pay.

1:04:33.682 --> 1:04:35.063
Great.

1:04:35.163 --> 1:04:37.265
So, what do you say?
Back in with the ads?

1:04:37.365 --> 1:04:41.149
Sure. Why not?

1:04:41.249 --> 1:04:43.952
Guess sometimes you just have to
accept the things you're good at

1:04:44.052 --> 1:04:45.233
and the things you're not.

1:04:45.333 --> 1:04:48.036
Thattagirl.
You won't regret this.

1:04:48.136 --> 1:04:49.998
I'll have McKayla send over
the paperwork straight away.

1:04:50.098 --> 1:04:53.201
So, we need to set up meetings
as soon as possible.

1:04:53.301 --> 1:04:56.564
Can you come back tomorrow?
- Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1:04:56.664 --> 1:04:59.247
I have a tree lighting
ceremony performance.

1:04:59.347 --> 1:05:00.768
Okay,
what about the next day?

1:05:00.868 --> 1:05:02.210
Christmas Day?

1:05:02.310 --> 1:05:04.252
No, sorry, that's right.

1:05:04.352 --> 1:05:06.133
Offices are closed. Um--

1:05:06.233 --> 1:05:08.896
So, let's do the 26th.
First thing in the morning?

1:05:08.996 --> 1:05:11.378
I guess I can be back then.

1:05:11.478 --> 1:05:14.782
I just have to leave to go back
to New York on Christmas Day.

1:05:14.882 --> 1:05:17.845
Ah, perfect.
You won't regret this, Abby.

1:05:19.446 --> 1:05:20.988
You know, you can't take
opportunities like this

1:05:21.088 --> 1:05:22.269
for granted.

1:05:22.369 --> 1:05:25.512
It's very lucrative,
for all of us.

1:05:25.612 --> 1:05:27.834
Yeah. Right.

1:05:27.934 --> 1:05:29.356
Thanks, Brenda.

1:05:29.456 --> 1:05:31.458
You're welcome, honey.

1:05:52.758 --> 1:05:53.740
Abby.

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:55.461
Ugh. Again?

1:05:55.561 --> 1:05:57.703
Are you following me?

1:05:57.803 --> 1:06:00.066
It's the only cafe in town.

1:06:00.166 --> 1:06:01.507
- I don't have time for this.
- Whoa, Abby.

1:06:01.607 --> 1:06:02.788
Can you talk to me?
What's going on?

1:06:02.888 --> 1:06:04.590
Is this about the song?

1:06:04.690 --> 1:06:06.031
What do you think it is,
Travis?

1:06:06.131 --> 1:06:09.275
Oh, by the way,
everyone rejected it.

1:06:09.375 --> 1:06:11.236
Oh, I'm sorry, that's--

1:06:11.336 --> 1:06:12.958
that's disappointing.

1:06:13.058 --> 1:06:14.920
Yeah, well, maybe you'll have
better luck as a solo act.

1:06:15.020 --> 1:06:17.683
Huh?

1:06:17.783 --> 1:06:20.525
Look, I'll be at the ceremony
tonight but I'm leaving tomorrow

1:06:20.625 --> 1:06:22.287
so you don't have to deal
with me anymore.

1:06:22.387 --> 1:06:24.249
What, you're leaving like
you're going back to New York?

1:06:24.349 --> 1:06:25.851
Yeah.

1:06:25.951 --> 1:06:27.532
But I thought you were staying
through New Year's.

1:06:27.632 --> 1:06:29.634
I've got work to attend to
in New York.

1:06:30.675 --> 1:06:31.616
Okay.

1:06:31.716 --> 1:06:32.938
I'll see you tonight though?

1:06:33.038 --> 1:06:35.480
Yeah. I'll be there.

1:07:04.628 --> 1:07:06.330
And now for your
next performance,

1:07:06.430 --> 1:07:10.894
please welcome the Bellville
Middle School Youth Choir.

1:07:20.524 --> 1:07:22.506
Guys, you got this, okay?

1:07:22.606 --> 1:07:24.027
We've been practicing this song
for months,

1:07:24.127 --> 1:07:25.589
you know it like the back
of your hands.

1:07:25.689 --> 1:07:27.270
It's gonna be amazing.
-

1:07:30.333 --> 1:07:31.955
What is that?
What am I hearing?

1:07:32.055 --> 1:07:33.076
What are they--

1:07:33.176 --> 1:07:35.358
♪ Fa, la-la la-la ♪

1:07:35.458 --> 1:07:38.361
♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪

1:07:38.461 --> 1:07:42.004
♪ Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la-la ♪

1:07:42.104 --> 1:07:43.206
♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪

1:07:43.306 --> 1:07:45.007
They're singing
"Deck the Halls".

1:07:45.107 --> 1:07:47.089
They're supposed to be singing
"O Little Town of Bethlehem".

1:07:47.189 --> 1:07:48.531
It's right here
in the program.

1:07:48.631 --> 1:07:50.172
Yeah well, they must've
switched last minute.

1:07:50.272 --> 1:07:51.293
Um, Mr. Tucker?

1:07:51.393 --> 1:07:52.615
We have a bigger problem.

1:07:52.715 --> 1:07:54.336
What's wrong?

1:07:54.436 --> 1:07:57.059
Ethan's missing. I may have
spooked him out a little.

1:07:57.159 --> 1:07:59.181
Lyla, what did you say?

1:07:59.281 --> 1:08:00.743
Nothing! Nothing.

1:08:00.843 --> 1:08:02.865
I just reminded him
that the entire arts program

1:08:02.965 --> 1:08:05.227
is counting on him
performing perfectly tonight

1:08:05.327 --> 1:08:06.508
and that if he messes up,

1:08:06.608 --> 1:08:07.910
generations of
Bellville High students

1:08:08.010 --> 1:08:09.351
will miss out on
the joys of music forever

1:08:09.451 --> 1:08:11.433
until the end of time.
- Lila.

1:08:11.533 --> 1:08:13.675
We have to find him.

1:08:13.775 --> 1:08:15.317
Okay, everybody.
We gotta split up.

1:08:15.417 --> 1:08:16.718
Some of you go check
the classrooms,

1:08:16.818 --> 1:08:17.999
some of you
sweep the hallways.

1:08:18.099 --> 1:08:19.881
Abby and I will check
the music room.

1:08:19.981 --> 1:08:21.683
What about our performance?
We're next.

1:08:21.783 --> 1:08:23.925
Well, we're not going on
without our piano player.

1:08:24.025 --> 1:08:25.567
Lila, you stay here

1:08:25.667 --> 1:08:27.609
and, I don't know,
stall them.

1:08:27.709 --> 1:08:29.050
Oh, okay.

1:08:33.835 --> 1:08:36.737
Do you think we should
call his mom?

1:08:36.837 --> 1:08:38.539
I mean,
where could he be?

1:08:38.639 --> 1:08:41.142
Oh, you're speaking to me now?
No more baseless accusations?

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:42.783
I heard you going
behind my back, Travis.

1:08:42.883 --> 1:08:44.465
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything.

1:08:44.565 --> 1:08:46.907
You were trying to take
all the credit for our song.

1:08:47.007 --> 1:08:49.950
What?! You really think
I would do that?

1:08:50.050 --> 1:08:52.292
I don't know what you would do,
but it sure seems like it.

1:08:54.374 --> 1:08:57.878
You're so bitter about your past
that you can't trust anyone.

1:08:57.978 --> 1:09:00.440
Actually, it's just
the untrustworthy ones

1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:02.542
that I can't trust.

1:09:06.226 --> 1:09:10.410
♪ Fa-la-la la-la, la-la la-la ♪

1:09:18.638 --> 1:09:20.620
Isn't that great?

1:09:23.403 --> 1:09:27.146
And now for our final
performance of the evening,

1:09:27.246 --> 1:09:29.348
please welcome
the Bellville High School Band.

1:09:29.448 --> 1:09:31.450
-
- Woo!

1:09:47.306 --> 1:09:49.128
What do you mean,
he's missing?

1:09:49.228 --> 1:09:50.729
Can't Abby play the piano?

1:09:50.829 --> 1:09:52.851
Well, they're all gone now.
So--

1:09:52.951 --> 1:09:54.092
This is bad.

1:09:54.192 --> 1:09:57.676
- Yeah.
- This is very, very bad.

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:02.581
Ethan!
He's gotta be in here.

1:10:02.681 --> 1:10:05.243
Ethan!
- There he is.

1:10:09.768 --> 1:10:11.189
Ethan, are you okay?

1:10:11.289 --> 1:10:13.952
What happened?

1:10:14.052 --> 1:10:15.513
I'm sorry, Mr. Tucker.

1:10:15.613 --> 1:10:17.795
I don't wanna let you down
but I can't do it.

1:10:17.895 --> 1:10:20.678
Of course you can do it.
You were born for this.

1:10:20.778 --> 1:10:23.161
What if I mess up,
lose the school's funding?

1:10:23.261 --> 1:10:24.722
It's just
too much pressure.

1:10:24.822 --> 1:10:25.883
You're not gonna mess up.

1:10:25.983 --> 1:10:28.185
But I could.
How do you know?

1:10:34.391 --> 1:10:37.334
We'll all take
a two minute break, folks.

1:10:39.156 --> 1:10:41.238
Just a perfect time to refill
those gingerbread lattes.

1:10:46.003 --> 1:10:47.584
I-- I--

1:10:47.684 --> 1:10:49.506
What on Earth's going on,
Cynthia? They're all waiting!

1:10:49.606 --> 1:10:51.028
We hit a slight
technical hiccup

1:10:51.128 --> 1:10:52.389
but we'll be ready
any minute now.

1:10:52.489 --> 1:10:53.830
Any minute!
- Well, I'm telling you,

1:10:53.930 --> 1:10:55.472
I am not impressed by this.

1:10:55.572 --> 1:10:57.354
Not impressed by this at all.
- I'm sorry, we hit--

1:10:57.454 --> 1:10:59.516
If these kids can't take
their music program seriously,

1:10:59.616 --> 1:11:01.077
then why should
the school board?

1:11:01.177 --> 1:11:03.680
This whole debacle's proven
my instincts were right.

1:11:03.780 --> 1:11:06.222
Our funds could be put
to a much better use elsewhere.

1:11:12.188 --> 1:11:15.491
Ethan, look.
No matter how you perform,

1:11:15.591 --> 1:11:18.094
you'd still be showing
that you are more impressive

1:11:18.194 --> 1:11:19.735
than 99%
of the people out there

1:11:19.835 --> 1:11:23.419
that don't even have the guts
to follow their dreams.

1:11:23.519 --> 1:11:26.662
Remember what I said-
trust your intuition.

1:11:26.762 --> 1:11:28.964
You've got this.

1:11:30.566 --> 1:11:32.748
And-- and you don't
have to be perfect.

1:11:32.848 --> 1:11:35.330
You just have to make
the audience feel something.

1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:47.843
- Uh, guys?
- What's up?

1:11:47.943 --> 1:11:50.325
I just got an email
from the Powell School of Music.

1:11:50.425 --> 1:11:52.888
They said they loved the song
and the performance.

1:11:52.988 --> 1:11:55.210
They wanna see me
for a final in-person audition!

1:11:55.310 --> 1:11:56.891
Oh my God.

1:11:56.991 --> 1:11:58.993
That's incredible,
congratulations!

1:12:00.235 --> 1:12:02.857
Wow, I didn't even know
you applied!

1:12:02.957 --> 1:12:04.058
Nice work.

1:12:04.158 --> 1:12:05.700
Yeah, that audition tape
we sent in,

1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:07.061
I knew it was gonna
blow their minds.

1:12:07.161 --> 1:12:08.783
I didn't even think
it was that good.

1:12:08.883 --> 1:12:10.545
We made it
in like two minutes.

1:12:10.645 --> 1:12:11.906
Audition tape?

1:12:12.006 --> 1:12:13.908
Yeah, he performed
"A Christmas Melody"

1:12:14.008 --> 1:12:15.790
and we sent it
to the admissions coordinator.

1:12:15.890 --> 1:12:18.032
That's what you sent?

1:12:18.132 --> 1:12:20.494
Yeah.
What do you think I sent?

1:12:23.817 --> 1:12:26.961
Wait-- did you think
that I sent our song out

1:12:27.061 --> 1:12:29.062
without your permission?

1:12:29.823 --> 1:12:31.525
Just what you were saying
on the phone.

1:12:31.625 --> 1:12:34.208
It sounded like you--

1:12:34.308 --> 1:12:37.170
Abby, I would never
betray you like that.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:39.853
I'm so sorry
I jumped to conclusions.

1:12:39.953 --> 1:12:42.976
No, it's okay. I'm sorry
you thought that of me.

1:12:43.076 --> 1:12:45.138
You have nothing
to apologise for.

1:12:45.238 --> 1:12:49.863
I let my experience with Casey
Macey cloud my judgment and--

1:12:49.963 --> 1:12:51.985
Uh, guys?

1:12:52.085 --> 1:12:54.087
Don't we have a song
to perform?

1:12:55.648 --> 1:12:56.910
- Yes. We do.
- Uh, yeah.

1:12:57.010 --> 1:13:00.153
Come on, let's get ready.
Let me help you.

1:13:00.253 --> 1:13:02.255
Thanks.

1:13:03.976 --> 1:13:06.659
Put that on.
All right, let's go.

1:13:08.381 --> 1:13:10.423
Let's go find the others.

1:13:13.586 --> 1:13:15.367
All right, that's enough.
I'm telling them it's over.

1:13:15.467 --> 1:13:18.250
Please wait just one more
minute. They worked so hard.

1:13:18.350 --> 1:13:20.352
I'm sorry, Cynthia.

1:13:22.594 --> 1:13:24.817
Ethan, hurry up!
We're next!

1:13:24.917 --> 1:13:26.098
We're next! Hurry up!

1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:30.542
- They're here!
- Oh, thank goodness!

1:13:30.642 --> 1:13:32.644
Finally.

1:13:36.248 --> 1:13:37.709
Okay. Okay.

1:13:41.893 --> 1:13:43.274
Okay, guys.

1:13:43.374 --> 1:13:44.916
I think we gotta stick
with "Deck the Halls".

1:13:45.016 --> 1:13:47.158
It's the song we practiced,
it's the song we know.

1:13:47.258 --> 1:13:48.920
It'll be great.
- No.

1:13:49.020 --> 1:13:51.763
We can't end the entire ceremony
on a repeat song.

1:13:51.863 --> 1:13:54.085
We need to wow
Superintendent Davis.

1:13:54.185 --> 1:13:56.968
We need to do
"A Christmas Melody".

1:13:57.068 --> 1:13:59.490
Well, we've only practiced
that song in class once.

1:13:59.590 --> 1:14:01.492
We don't even have
the sheet music with us.

1:14:01.592 --> 1:14:03.494
Yeah, but we've all
practiced it at home, right?

1:14:03.594 --> 1:14:04.735
You guys remember it.

1:14:04.835 --> 1:14:06.777
No one's ever heard
the song before,

1:14:06.877 --> 1:14:08.299
so do you really think
it'll make an impact?

1:14:08.399 --> 1:14:10.541
You'll sing it for us.

1:14:10.641 --> 1:14:11.582
What?!

1:14:11.682 --> 1:14:13.023
No, she's right.

1:14:13.123 --> 1:14:14.385
Your voice is incredible.

1:14:14.485 --> 1:14:16.387
With you singing
and Ethan's piano playing,

1:14:16.487 --> 1:14:18.589
it could save the program!

1:14:18.689 --> 1:14:20.811
- Please!
- Please, Miss Walker?

1:14:32.862 --> 1:14:34.985
Must be something, right?

1:14:37.627 --> 1:14:39.489
This is the last--
Oh.

1:14:39.589 --> 1:14:42.352
Okay. They're here.
-

1:14:44.474 --> 1:14:46.916
Just a little delay.

1:14:58.848 --> 1:15:01.791
And now,
may I present to you

1:15:01.891 --> 1:15:05.174
the Bellville High School Band's
performance of...

1:15:12.501 --> 1:15:14.803
.."A Christmas Melody",

1:15:14.903 --> 1:15:18.727
an original song written by
Abby Walker and Travis Tucker.

1:15:47.615 --> 1:15:49.397
You okay?

1:15:49.497 --> 1:15:50.918
It's okay.

That was amazing!

1:19:45.485 --> 1:19:47.948
Woo!

1:19:48.048 --> 1:19:50.430
Thank you,
Bellville High Band

1:19:50.530 --> 1:19:53.353
for a truly spectacular
performance!

1:19:53.453 --> 1:19:55.956
I know that our arts program
is in question of funding

1:19:56.056 --> 1:19:57.197
for next year,

1:19:57.297 --> 1:20:00.120
and I for one
have been prepared

1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:02.122
to vote to cut it.

1:20:04.784 --> 1:20:08.688
But tonight was not just
an amazing example

1:20:08.788 --> 1:20:10.290
of music and talent,

1:20:10.390 --> 1:20:13.653
but community,
educational excellence,

1:20:13.753 --> 1:20:15.975
and Christmas spirit.

1:20:16.075 --> 1:20:19.418
And I am happy to say
that I will not be voting

1:20:19.518 --> 1:20:21.300
to cut the funding for
the arts program next year.

1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:23.142
- Ooh!
- Yay!

1:20:37.936 --> 1:20:40.879
- We got our funding!
- Mom, this is amazing!

1:20:40.979 --> 1:20:43.041
You all did such a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

1:20:43.141 --> 1:20:45.083
You did such a great job
planning this whole thing!

1:20:45.183 --> 1:20:47.365
Oh, thanks, honey! Ooh!

1:20:48.667 --> 1:20:50.769
Oh. Gotta get this.

1:20:50.869 --> 1:20:53.091
Excuse me.

1:20:53.191 --> 1:20:55.193
Wow.

1:21:01.319 --> 1:21:03.942
Thank you so much.

1:21:07.165 --> 1:21:08.706
Hello?

1:21:08.806 --> 1:21:12.230
Abby, hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you on Christmas Eve.

1:21:12.330 --> 1:21:14.071
I was working late,
I wanted to call you

1:21:14.171 --> 1:21:15.713
before leaving
for the holidays.

1:21:15.813 --> 1:21:17.595
Oh, it's not a bother at all.
What's up, McKayla?

1:21:17.695 --> 1:21:21.559
I thought you should know,
Brenda never sent your song out.

1:21:21.659 --> 1:21:23.080
What?

1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:24.842
She's never sent
any of your songs out.

1:21:24.942 --> 1:21:27.644
I only found out a few days ago.
I tried to tell you earlier.

1:21:27.744 --> 1:21:30.687
But why would she not
send my songs out?

1:21:30.787 --> 1:21:32.049
She gets a huge cut

1:21:32.149 --> 1:21:33.570
of your corporate
commercial commissions-

1:21:33.670 --> 1:21:34.811
more than you know.

1:21:34.911 --> 1:21:36.053
She doesn't want you
to quit those.

1:21:36.153 --> 1:21:37.494
They're lucrative for her.

1:21:37.594 --> 1:21:40.217
After all these years
she's been lying to me?

1:21:40.317 --> 1:21:41.618
Here's the thing.

1:21:41.718 --> 1:21:44.581
I sent your song
to an executive at a label.

1:21:44.681 --> 1:21:45.942
She loved it!

1:21:46.042 --> 1:21:48.825
She wants to sign you.
- Are you serious?

1:21:48.925 --> 1:21:51.347
I could be your agent.
I'll negotiate a deal.

1:21:51.447 --> 1:21:53.710
That would be amazing!

1:21:53.810 --> 1:21:55.151
Thank you!

1:21:55.251 --> 1:21:57.253
Thank you.

1:21:57.854 --> 1:22:00.356
But make sure that they know
that I have a partner.

1:22:00.456 --> 1:22:01.477
We come as a duo.

1:22:01.577 --> 1:22:03.639
You got it.

1:22:03.739 --> 1:22:06.162
Thanks again, McKayla.
I gotta go.

1:22:06.262 --> 1:22:08.464
Okay. All right, bye.

1:22:20.155 --> 1:22:21.697
Shh. Everybody,

1:22:21.797 --> 1:22:24.019
we're about to do
the tree lighting.

1:22:26.281 --> 1:22:29.424
It is now with great pleasure
that I light our trees-

1:22:29.524 --> 1:22:32.347
a tradition
that I hope lasts forever,

1:22:32.447 --> 1:22:34.529
along with our arts
Christmas pageant.

1:22:36.851 --> 1:22:40.155
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

1:22:49.344 --> 1:22:51.686
Wow, so beautiful.

1:22:51.786 --> 1:22:53.788
Aw, the big one didn't light.

1:22:58.833 --> 1:23:01.415
Still beautiful.

1:23:01.515 --> 1:23:03.537
So, I was thinking,
what do you think

1:23:03.637 --> 1:23:05.539
about me sticking around
Bellville for a little bit?

1:23:05.639 --> 1:23:08.142
I don't know.
I mean, I'm pretty busy.

1:23:08.242 --> 1:23:10.584
Got a lot goin' on.

1:23:10.684 --> 1:23:12.826
I'm just kidding.

1:23:12.926 --> 1:23:14.388
Of course I would love
for you to stay.

1:23:14.488 --> 1:23:16.870
Well, it'd make it
much easier for us

1:23:16.970 --> 1:23:20.153
to keep working together,
making music.

1:23:20.253 --> 1:23:23.837
Especially since we're about
to have a record deal!

1:23:23.937 --> 1:23:25.799
Are you-- are you serious?

1:23:25.899 --> 1:23:27.280
I am!

1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:29.523
- What!
-

1:23:29.623 --> 1:23:33.006
- That's-- that's incredible!
- Yeah.

1:23:33.106 --> 1:23:34.848
But you know, even if we didn't
have a record deal,

1:23:34.948 --> 1:23:36.449
I'd still wanna sing
with you.

1:23:36.549 --> 1:23:40.153
I never wanna stop making music
