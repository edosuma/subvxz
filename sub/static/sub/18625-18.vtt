[music playing]

00:45.128 --> 00:48.006
Mary, can we be real for a moment?

00:48.090 --> 00:51.718
A woman like you
deserves anything she wants.

00:51.802 --> 00:56.014
And what you want is me,
as your date to the Spring Fling.

00:56.098 --> 00:59.560
-It's okay, you don't even have to ask.
-I'd rather choke to death.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.769
[bangs]

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
Huh. Your loss.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.480
Hmm!

01:05.022 --> 01:06.024
-Darcy.
-[door bangs]

01:10.028 --> 01:11.405
[bangs]

01:12.531 --> 01:13.699
[coughs]

01:15.158 --> 01:16.159
-[thumps]
-[sighs]

01:16.243 --> 01:19.329
-Well, I've asked out every single girl.
-They all said no?

01:19.413 --> 01:23.750
Of course not. I got a few "as ifs."
A couple "not in a million years."

01:23.834 --> 01:27.087
One actually gagged.
I took that as a "not interested."

01:27.170 --> 01:29.840
You actually asked out
every girl in school?

01:29.923 --> 01:34.177
Nope! Saved Claire for you, buddy.
I didn't wanna promblock you.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.513
-Thanks.
-You haven't asked her yet, have you?

01:36.596 --> 01:38.140
I'm working up to it, okay?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.309
Oh, is that what they're calling
"wussing out"?

01:40.392 --> 01:42.477
Hey, I'm just waiting for my moment.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.605
That's what they call wussing out
these days, Wussy.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.566
-He's correct, Master Jim.
-[boys gasp]

01:47.649 --> 01:50.027
I spent the afternoon
in the school library

01:50.110 --> 01:52.863
and you are, apparently,
a popular topic of gossip.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.866
Blinky, what are you doing hanging out
at our school?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.451
Well, that's an interesting story.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.286
Wait, you said people are gossiping
about Jim?

01:59.369 --> 02:00.454
I didn't hear much

02:00.537 --> 02:04.041
but the words "wussing" and "out"
were frequently invoked.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.293
Why were you in the library of our school?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.086
I exhausted all of Trollmarket's resources

02:09.170 --> 02:12.633
pertaining to the mysterious mark
Angor Rot painted on your forehead.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.177
Then a thought occurred to me--
"What about the library

02:15.260 --> 02:17.137
-in Arcadia Oaks High?"
-And?

02:17.220 --> 02:22.726
Sadly, all I learned was that Master Jim
is a wuss when it comes to the fairer sex.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.103
Oh, really?

02:25.187 --> 02:29.608
Look at that hypnotic,
bewitching allure of that swaying mole.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.068
Excuse me, seems I was wrong

02:31.151 --> 02:34.321
about asking out
every non-Claire girl in school.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.784
Does he even know if a female is,
in fact, beneath that costume?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.285
I really don't think it matters.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.499
Yes! I knew it!

02:45.582 --> 02:47.626
Hey, you! You have a visitor's pass?

02:47.709 --> 02:50.587
My dear sir,
I dare say, my humanity is my pass.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.506
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
You might wanna run.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.715
Why on Earth would I...?

02:53.799 --> 02:55.884
All right, all right. Let's go, stranger.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.677
[guard] Stranger Danger!
[Blinky] Very well!

03:01.181 --> 03:02.391
Um...

03:02.474 --> 03:03.475
[stammers] M-Master Vendel?

03:04.476 --> 03:08.480
I am known to no troll as "Master."

03:08.939 --> 03:11.274
[Jim] Oh. Okay.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.984
Well, Vendel--

03:13.068 --> 03:16.029
But I like the sound of it
coming from you.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.241
The Birthstone you recovered
from Gatto's Lair.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.826
[grunts]

03:20.909 --> 03:24.287
-It must be cleaved.
-Cleaved?

03:26.331 --> 03:30.293
You humans cut stones
to unlock their beauty,

03:30.377 --> 03:35.841
but trolls cut stones
to unlock their <i>power.</i>

03:35.924 --> 03:40.220
Chisel along the ridge, right over here.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.722
[Vendel] Yes.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.639
[tapping]

03:43.640 --> 03:46.393
And along this facet.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.561
[cracks]

03:47.644 --> 03:48.812
Excellent.

03:48.895 --> 03:53.066
I thought you were against finding
the Triumbric stones.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.569
I am against you collecting the stones.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.822
If you were to fall into Gunmar's hands,
he would use you

03:58.905 --> 04:03.285
to escape the bridge
and unleash himself upon this world.

04:03.368 --> 04:08.623
Keep your eye on the stone,
and your hand steady. A little off, here!

04:09.082 --> 04:10.000
[cracks]

04:12.961 --> 04:16.339
Excuse me for wondering
but then, why are you helping me?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.966
You are determined to save
Claire's brother?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.302
[Jim] I am.

04:20.385 --> 04:25.056
Then for everyone's sake, what choice
have I but to do all within my power

04:25.140 --> 04:28.769
to make sure you are successful?

04:28.852 --> 04:31.563
-Its pure form.
-Whoa.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.648
Hand it over.

04:33.732 --> 04:37.402
The power of a gem
can alter your armor's ability.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.616
[whirring]

04:43.658 --> 04:47.621
A combination of gems,
like the Triumbric stones,

04:47.704 --> 04:49.998
can reap infinite rewards.

04:58.048 --> 05:02.636
-Okay. So, what just happened?
-I am unsure.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.764
Properly cut gemstones work
in ways one can never predict.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.267
-Only discover.
-I wanna discover.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.979
Then maybe I should tell you
where the Killstone is hidden.

05:13.939 --> 05:18.443
They'll be going for the Killstone
in the Swamps of the Quagawumps.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.111
The Killstone?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.906
A remnant of Gunmar's first kill,

05:22.989 --> 05:25.075
where he shattered
their beloved Wumpa King.

05:25.909 --> 05:26.868
-[clangs]
-[screams]

05:28.245 --> 05:32.541
Quagawumps. I have heard
they are not friendly to outsiders.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.210
Especially the human kind.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.796
Recover the Killstone.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.382
And destroy the Hunter.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.968
Now that he is marked,

05:43.051 --> 05:48.765
I look forward to taking
what is most dear from him.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.350
As you wish.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.103
[whirs]

05:55.230 --> 05:57.983
If Wumpas don't let outsiders
into their camp,

05:58.066 --> 06:00.151
-how do we get the stone?
-Don't worry, Master Jim!

06:00.235 --> 06:01.945
I already have a plan! It's rudimentary.

06:02.028 --> 06:06.408
If Quagawumps are hostile to outsiders,
we'll need an insider!

06:06.491 --> 06:08.868
One of you is going to pretend
to be the human reincarnation

06:08.952 --> 06:12.998
-of the Shattered King! It's genius!
-What? That's insane!

06:13.081 --> 06:14.958
[bangs, whirs]

06:20.630 --> 06:23.425
You, Tobias,
bear a most striking resemblance

06:23.508 --> 06:25.135
-to their dead king.
-Me?

06:25.218 --> 06:28.221
Yes. The Quagawumps
are short and stout in stature.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.223
It'll be a role of a lifetime.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.726
Mostly because if they see past
our little charade,

06:32.809 --> 06:34.769
the time of our lives will end.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.064
[Toby yelps]

06:38.898 --> 06:40.942
-Well, we better get a move on!
-[groans]

06:41.026 --> 06:43.194
[bird squawking]

06:44.029 --> 06:46.281
This place is creepy. Where are we?

06:46.364 --> 06:51.995
A place renowned for its vast swamps,
theme parks and retirement communities.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.371
Florida!

06:53.455 --> 06:56.958
Come on, Your Eminence.
Your people await.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.044
[Toby] I'm just saying--

06:59.127 --> 07:02.005
I'm built to be a sidekick,
you know? I'm not--

07:02.088 --> 07:03.089
[yelps]

07:03.173 --> 07:06.134
leading man material. I'm a wingman.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.304
Don't be a wuss.
[chuckles] Come on.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.475
[rustling]

07:13.558 --> 07:15.268
Hmm? [growls]

07:15.352 --> 07:16.186
[thumps]

07:16.269 --> 07:18.396
[chanting]

07:22.025 --> 07:24.361
[all chanting]

07:28.573 --> 07:31.076
Mmm! Humans!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.328
A taste not common.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.830
-Toby?
-Okay.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.748
[all gasp]

07:36.831 --> 07:38.959
It is I, the Shower King!

07:39.042 --> 07:41.127
-[Blinky] Shattered.
-The Shattered King!

07:41.211 --> 07:44.965
Reincarnated as a human.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.883
[howls]
Whoo-oo!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.426
You're not a ghost.

07:48.927 --> 07:49.761
[growls]

07:49.844 --> 07:51.763
[Wumpas chanting]

07:52.639 --> 07:56.851
Gunmar kill you.
You cannot be. Prove you are he.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.105
Show us great magics, god king.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.314
Hi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yah!

08:01.398 --> 08:03.316
Hi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yah! [chanting]

08:03.400 --> 08:04.818
[whimpering]

08:04.901 --> 08:05.860
Ahem...?

08:05.944 --> 08:07.320
[sighs]

08:07.404 --> 08:10.532
Okay. All right, now. Stand back.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.616
[chanting stops]

08:11.700 --> 08:14.119
This one's not for the faint of heart.

08:14.202 --> 08:18.999
Abara-cadabara, nothing up my sleeve-ara!

08:19.082 --> 08:19.916
[both gasp]

08:20.000 --> 08:21.626
[gasping]

08:22.127 --> 08:27.215
He dismembered his hand
and then rejoined his flesh and bone!

08:27.298 --> 08:30.593
His magic is so powerful!

08:30.677 --> 08:32.220
Hi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yah!

08:32.303 --> 08:34.014
[Wumpas chanting]

08:37.017 --> 08:40.477
Nice work, Tobes.
You are leading man material!

08:40.562 --> 08:41.645
Ha-ha-ha!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.190
Hi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yah!

08:44.816 --> 08:47.652
The lost king, returned!

08:47.736 --> 08:48.570
[Wumpas chanting]

08:49.237 --> 08:50.071
[gasps] Huh?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.490
[chanting continues]

08:55.785 --> 08:57.495
[all] Hi-yi-yi yi-yi-yi-yi-yah!

08:58.955 --> 08:59.831
[chanting continues]

08:59.914 --> 09:02.792
-I don't believe it.
-Neither do I.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.421
Ugh, I know, right?
He doesn't even look anything like me.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.839
[yelps, gasps]

09:09.340 --> 09:10.425
[Wumpa laughs]

09:10.508 --> 09:13.470
Mouth filled with precious metals!

09:13.553 --> 09:16.056
Hey, watch your hand there. Ugh!

09:16.139 --> 09:19.642
So handsome the king is! [laughs]

09:19.726 --> 09:23.521
That's what I keep telling the girls
at school, but they weren't interested.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.899
[Wumpa] Who are these girls at school?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.819
We shall hunt them down,
and make flutes out of their arms!

09:29.903 --> 09:33.865
No, don't do that! That's very kind
of you, but not necessary.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.202
[Wumpas singing]

09:37.285 --> 09:38.536
[gasps]

09:39.454 --> 09:41.331
[Blinky] A song of a Quagawump.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.084
No outsider has ever heard
such a rare delight.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.168
Catchy!

09:45.251 --> 09:48.004
Awesome sauce!

09:48.088 --> 09:50.340
[Claire] This song is so beautiful.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.135
-Come. We feast.
-Oh! What's on the menu?

09:54.219 --> 09:57.430
Outsider tried to sneak into camp
last night.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.892
Tonight, we eat its heart.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.686
[portal rumbles]

10:06.815 --> 10:08.108
[chuckles]

10:08.650 --> 10:09.484
[Wumpa] Hey!

10:09.567 --> 10:11.486
[Wumpas chanting]

10:12.153 --> 10:14.364
Ah! Fresh swamp maggots.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.406
[Claire] Ugh!

10:15.490 --> 10:16.324
[Blinky murmuring]

10:17.534 --> 10:18.368
Ugh!

10:20.120 --> 10:21.371
[chomps] Ugh!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.957
Eh? Ooh!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.543
Mm! This is delicious.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.003
What is it? [gasps]

10:29.087 --> 10:32.423
-It's not people, is it?
-Flamingo!

10:32.507 --> 10:35.301
Don't you think it's time to ask them
for the you-know-what?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.428
We just got here.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.391
We don't want
to just exploit the situation, do we?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.853
This servant bother you?
You want me kill him?

10:44.936 --> 10:48.189
No, no, no, he's fine. For now.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.025
It is you? Really you?

10:51.109 --> 10:55.864
Faith I kept.
Others follow Blungo, the Pretend King.

10:55.947 --> 11:00.577
-"Pretend King"?
-And now you stay and fight Blungo?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.578
[kisses]

11:01.661 --> 11:04.956
-Yeah.
-Oh, great king.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.711
Now is the time of telling.
Why returned have you?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.005
Uh, yeah.

11:13.464 --> 11:17.218
I have returned for one great purpose--
ahem--

11:17.302 --> 11:23.641
to tell you of my grand adventures
in a far-off mystic land called Arcadia!

11:23.725 --> 11:25.143
[Wumpas gasp]

11:25.226 --> 11:29.564
Yeah! Yeah! There, I battled
the diabolical Coach Lawrence

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
and his Unclimbable Ropes!

11:33.234 --> 11:36.195
[Toby] And that day, I was going commando.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.699
Or should I say, comman-do?

11:39.782 --> 11:40.783
[Wumpas applaud]

11:42.410 --> 11:46.080
More! Another warrior epic we hear!

11:46.164 --> 11:50.376
-Excuse me, god king?
-Please, kneel. It's protocol.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.005
What are you doing? I thought
you were trying to get the stone.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.841
I'm their king, man.
They wanna hear stories.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.426
We can't just lie to them and bounce.

11:58.509 --> 12:03.014
The longer we stay here, the more likely
we'll end up on the dinner plate.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.393
Fine. I'll ask for the stone,
after you ask Claire to the dance!

12:07.477 --> 12:08.895
