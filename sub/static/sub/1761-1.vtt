01:02.504 --> 01:05.657
So four months later,
she's pregnant again,

01:05.757 --> 01:07.993
you know, so we're going back
down to the clinic, she's crying,

01:08.093 --> 01:12.081
"Do you love me?" and all that type
of stuff, I told her I did but...

01:12.181 --> 01:14.224
You think that means
I'm going to hell?

01:14.975 --> 01:16.767
Nah.

01:17.561 --> 01:19.763
You know I dated a guy once.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.342
- Could I hear all about it?
- I mean, there's not a lot to tell,

01:23.442 --> 01:26.887
it's like one of the easiest weeks
of my life other than the sex.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.875
That was brutal.
You know, it's not the dick,

01:28.975 --> 01:32.359
it's the whiskers, man,
just creeps you out.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.686
Yeah, we just agreed on everything.

01:34.786 --> 01:36.480
"Want to get some beers?" "Yeah."

01:36.580 --> 01:38.982
"Want to watch the game?"
"Absolutely."

01:39.082 --> 01:41.485
We have beers and we watch the game.

01:41.585 --> 01:44.822
I hear a lot of myself in this story.

01:44.922 --> 01:47.841
There's none of you in the story,
man, it was a one-time thing.

01:48.258 --> 01:49.910
Yeah.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.830
My friend told me I can't
shit in his house anymore.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.124
- Oh, isn't that the worst?
- You believe that?

01:55.224 --> 01:58.168
Yeah, they get all mad 'cause
you blew out their bathroom.

01:58.268 --> 01:59.545
It's a place to shit.

01:59.645 --> 02:01.672
It's the... That's what
the room is built for.

02:01.772 --> 02:03.006
You're supposed to go
in there and take a shit

02:03.106 --> 02:05.676
and then when you do it,
they act like they're surprised.

02:05.776 --> 02:06.927
Like you took a dump on
their table or something.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.196
Yeah. I did take a dump on his table.

02:14.326 --> 02:16.494
Hey, man, you see that deer up there?

02:17.204 --> 02:18.905
Yeah, I see it.

02:19.289 --> 02:21.115
I don't think you do.

02:30.342 --> 02:32.911
Okay, I admit it.
I didn't see the deer.

02:33.011 --> 02:35.213
I see him now.

02:36.682 --> 02:39.180
Hey, check the back.

02:39.601 --> 02:41.044
Your back's fine.

02:41.144 --> 02:43.846
I'm gonna check the front.

02:56.118 --> 02:57.728
He's not gonna make it.

02:57.828 --> 03:00.230
They carry disease.

03:00.330 --> 03:03.453
All right, here we go. Up and over.

05:48.623 --> 05:50.901
- Gotta shit.
- Dammit.

05:51.001 --> 05:53.203
Just a second.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.863
Whoa.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.449
Sorry. The ladies' room was occupied.

05:57.549 --> 05:58.533
Would you mind moving?

05:58.633 --> 06:01.411
Well, why don't you...

06:01.511 --> 06:04.339
I don't mind doing
anything you ask me to do.

06:15.025 --> 06:16.885
What took you so long?

06:16.985 --> 06:19.888
Um, they were out of toilet paper.
Had to use my hands.

06:23.825 --> 06:25.394
I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit.

06:25.494 --> 06:27.270
And on the slitted sheet I sit.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.273
I slit a sheet, a sheet I
slit and on this shitted...

06:30.373 --> 06:31.650
- Dammit.
- You suck.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.943
I know.

06:34.544 --> 06:37.280
Hey, biatch, what did I say?

06:37.380 --> 06:39.574
Right. No texting.

06:39.674 --> 06:40.701
Sorry.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.286
You know, that's totally rude, Jenn.

06:43.386 --> 06:46.623
No textin' and no boys
for the entire weekend.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.626
Wow. That sounds so awesome.

06:49.726 --> 06:51.044
Shut up, Zoe.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.796
Maybe this is a bad idea.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.799
I don't want you guys to have a
lame weekend just 'cause of me.

06:55.899 --> 06:59.845
Well, great, let's re-invite the guys.
Isn't that right, Gosling?

06:59.945 --> 07:01.471
He says, "Yes, that's right."

07:01.571 --> 07:04.850
That's not real supportive, Zoe.
I mean, if Buck cheated on you,

07:04.950 --> 07:07.144
I wouldn't be making a joke
about it every five minutes.

07:07.244 --> 07:09.354
First of all, like,
Buck would never cheat on me.

07:09.454 --> 07:12.399
And second, I'm only kidding,
Jenn, so relax.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.372
This weekend is about Y-O-U.

07:15.752 --> 07:17.821
Yeah, we know that's asking
you to give up a lot.

07:17.921 --> 07:20.794
Nah, only about six inches.

07:22.092 --> 07:23.034
That is so gross.

07:23.134 --> 07:24.995
Yeah. Next subject, please.

07:25.095 --> 07:27.497
Mary, does your cousin's
shack have electricity?

07:27.597 --> 07:30.167
Why? Do you need a place
to plug in your vibrator?

07:30.267 --> 07:32.127
How dare you?

07:36.773 --> 07:39.134
Turn that music off, Mary.

07:39.234 --> 07:40.469
You seriously like this?

07:40.569 --> 07:42.846
You seriously don't?

07:42.946 --> 07:44.347
Don't listen.

07:44.447 --> 07:47.741
I can't believe I'm friends with
people who have no taste in music.

08:32.162 --> 08:34.534
Here we are.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.692
This is so beautiful.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.153
Do your cousins, like, throw their
trash in the middle of the lake?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.696
Why would you even ask that?

08:41.796 --> 08:42.905
'Cause, there's a big piece of wood

08:43.006 --> 08:45.583
just floating in the middle of it.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.586
That's a raft, you idiot.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.681
It's anchored there
so people can use it.

08:51.806 --> 08:53.553
Come on, let's go.
We're almost there.

08:53.975 --> 08:56.973
The suspense is killin' me.

09:03.693 --> 09:06.236
Are we stoppin' here for more gas?

09:09.032 --> 09:10.984
My legs!

09:14.663 --> 09:16.606
My butt hurts.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.316
Yeah, thanks to your boyfriend.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.277
Very funny.

09:20.377 --> 09:21.570
That's disgusting.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.747
I'm first.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.799
I seriously need a drink.

09:28.218 --> 09:29.327
Okay.

09:29.427 --> 09:32.122
Go kill some squirrels, buddy.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.248
Kill 'em good.

09:33.348 --> 09:34.749
What do you think?

09:34.849 --> 09:36.293
Are we really gonna swim in that bog?

09:36.393 --> 09:37.460
First off, it's a lake.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.879
And yes, we're really
gonna swim in it.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.298
I haven't swam in a
lake in my whole life.

09:41.398 --> 09:43.633
- Have you swam in a pool?
- Yeah.

09:43.733 --> 09:46.177
Well, I think you're gonna find out
it's really not all that different.

09:46.277 --> 09:49.139
Of course it's different.
This is nature.

09:49.239 --> 09:50.473
She's right.

09:50.573 --> 09:53.476
You're gonna wind up with a
lot more bugs in your mouth.

09:53.576 --> 09:55.103
Oh, you guys, that neighbor
lady is comin' over

09:55.203 --> 09:57.280
- so be nice.
- Oh, my God...

09:57.455 --> 10:00.249
Mary, is that you?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.694
Mrs. Gregorson.

10:02.794 --> 10:04.404
It's so nice to see you.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.865
Oh, my goodness, you have blossomed.

10:06.965 --> 10:07.991
Not really.

10:08.091 --> 10:09.826
Her tits are still small.

10:09.926 --> 10:10.911
Thanks, Zoe.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.831
Myrna, these are my sorority sisters,
this is Jenn and Zoe.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.625
Oh, right, well, it's a pleasure.

10:16.725 --> 10:18.768
- Hello.
- 'Sup, biatch?

10:19.769 --> 10:22.297
Are you looking after the house
while your cousins are away?

10:22.397 --> 10:23.840
Oh, no. We're just up
here for the weekend.

10:23.940 --> 10:27.302
Oh, right. Unwinding in
between all the exams.

10:27.402 --> 10:31.014
Well, we were supposed to
have torrid, getaway sex

10:31.114 --> 10:34.434
but Jenn's guy cheated on her, so...

10:34.534 --> 10:36.061
Oh, I see.

10:36.161 --> 10:38.021
She is kiddin', Mrs. Gregorson.

10:38.121 --> 10:41.574
I am kidding.
None of us have had sex.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.526
Ever.

10:43.626 --> 10:44.611
Yeah.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.196
Oh, it's okay, Mary.

10:46.296 --> 10:48.531
My daughter is a total
fuckin' bitch too.

10:48.631 --> 10:50.033
A real whore.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.201
Sometimes she brings people home,

10:51.301 --> 10:53.328
I don't even know what sex they are.

10:53.428 --> 10:55.288
And I'm not saying anything
negative about them,

10:55.388 --> 10:56.873
I'm a very, very liberal woman,

10:56.973 --> 11:01.018
but my daughter is a real piece
of work and not that attractive.

11:01.436 --> 11:04.214
Well, if you girls need anything,
you know where to find us.

11:04.314 --> 11:07.187
Winston and I would love to
have you over for breakfast.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.846
Yeah, that, that sounds nice.

11:11.946 --> 11:13.390
Maybe we'll take you up on that.

11:13.490 --> 11:14.891
No pressure, of course.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.034
Okay.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.986
Here we are.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.487
Home sweet home.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.863
Whoo!

11:31.466 --> 11:33.118
It smells in here.

11:33.218 --> 11:34.327
What's that smell in here?

11:34.427 --> 11:36.549
It smells like wood.

11:38.765 --> 11:39.833
Where's the bathroom?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.725
Straight down the hall.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.462
Where's the other bathroom?

11:44.562 --> 11:46.263
There's only one bathroom.

11:47.023 --> 11:48.174
I'm just gonna go right here.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.301
You seriously can't wait
two minutes for Jenn?

11:50.401 --> 11:52.470
Shh. It's coming out.

11:58.243 --> 11:59.894
Come on.

12:01.496 --> 12:03.243
What?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.944
One bathroom. Fun, right?

12:08.044 --> 12:10.121
Be my guest.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.170
Let me guess. No service.

12:17.679 --> 12:20.498
- What?
- Oh, Jenn, you are a horrible liar.

12:20.598 --> 12:22.208
Okay. I texted him back.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.627
Why are girls so attracted
to such assholes?

12:24.727 --> 12:26.588
You're not. Tommy's great.

12:26.688 --> 12:28.006
You are not supposed
to be talking to Sam.

12:28.106 --> 12:29.966
That is the whole purpose
of this entire trip.

12:30.066 --> 12:32.635
Well, it's not like I have
much of a choice now, is it?

12:32.735 --> 12:33.720
Exactly.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.472
How am I gonna check my messages?

12:35.572 --> 12:37.807
I have not gone more than
24 hours without Instagram

12:37.907 --> 12:40.780
since, like, there was no Instagram.

12:41.119 --> 12:42.353
And I'm copin'.

12:42.453 --> 12:43.813
If Zoe can do it, you can do it.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.943
There's no fuckin' service.

12:49.043 --> 12:50.111
You knew about this, didn't you?

12:50.211 --> 12:52.113
You said no boys, not no phones.

12:52.213 --> 12:53.323
I did say no phones.

12:53.423 --> 12:56.242
But you didn't say it would
be physically impossible

12:56.342 --> 12:57.702
to use it behind your back.

12:57.802 --> 12:59.329
What is the big deal, you guys?

12:59.429 --> 13:00.955
People went thousands of
years without cell phones,

13:01.055 --> 13:02.248
you can go two days.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.625
Speak for yourself.

13:03.725 --> 13:05.960
What if there's, like,
an emergency or somethin'?

13:06.060 --> 13:07.837
There's, like, a land line.

13:07.937 --> 13:09.589
A what?

13:09.689 --> 13:11.883
You guys, you're not gonna miss
your phones. I promise you.

13:11.983 --> 13:13.718
Now can we just get changed?

13:13.818 --> 13:15.595
I don't wanna get changed.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.738
I wanna send a text!

13:21.701 --> 13:24.699
No, no, Gosling, stay here.

13:25.121 --> 13:28.165
Sunglasses, check. Towels, check.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.401
Sunscreen, check.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.278
Whoo! All right, let's get naked.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.072
What are you doing?

13:34.172 --> 13:35.281
Someone could see you.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.908
Who? Mrs. Gregorson?

13:37.008 --> 13:38.660
I see, like, two houses here.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.372
If I'm getting anything out of being
stuck in the middle of nowhere,

13:42.472 --> 13:45.174
it's a tan without lines.

13:49.103 --> 13:50.964
Come on in, bitches.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.467
Well, I guess we can be grateful
she left the bottoms on.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.940
I bet Mrs. Gregorson swims topless.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.403
It's so nice out.

14:09.958 --> 14:12.285
Okay, do mine now.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.988
Oh, I'm so comfortable.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.447
Can't Mary do it?

14:16.547 --> 14:18.248
You used me.

14:19.175 --> 14:20.285
Stop.

14:20.385 --> 14:22.462
I'll do it.

14:26.307 --> 14:28.008
This is nice.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.931
What is that?

14:35.984 --> 14:37.802
Looks like a beaver dam.

14:37.902 --> 14:40.430
I want to see a beaver.
They're so adorable.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.806
Yeah, well don't get your hopes up.

14:41.906 --> 14:43.349
I'm pretty sure they're nocturnal.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.185
Where'd you learn that? Wikipedia?

14:45.285 --> 14:46.603
I learned it from livin' in Indiana,

14:46.703 --> 14:48.104
which means that you
should know it too.

14:48.204 --> 14:50.940
Well, all I know is they're fat
rats with big, stupid-ass teeth.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.741
Nice.

14:53.376 --> 14:55.544
Where are you goin'?

14:56.587 --> 14:59.039
Come on, let's go take a look.

15:00.049 --> 15:01.921
Whoo!

15:03.761 --> 15:06.134
Make it rain, bitches!

15:11.019 --> 15:12.766
Whoo!

15:28.369 --> 15:30.867
Here, beaver, beaver, beaver.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.024
Gross.

15:33.124 --> 15:34.859
Try banging on it,
that should wake 'em up.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.487
At least cover up, at least
while we're walkin' around.

15:37.587 --> 15:39.322
My top is on the other side.

15:39.422 --> 15:40.657
You wanna lend me yours?

15:40.757 --> 15:41.908
Cut it out.

15:43.926 --> 15:47.846
Ew. Is that like, green beaver urine?

15:48.056 --> 15:49.666
Guess.

15:49.766 --> 15:51.793
Kinda looks like it.

15:51.893 --> 15:54.003
Maybe that's like how they mark
their territory or somethin'.

15:54.103 --> 15:56.089
By pissin' all over their house?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.091
They don't live in
the dam, you idiot.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.814
They live in the lodge.

16:01.235 --> 16:02.936
Over there.

16:04.322 --> 16:05.848
Here, beaver, beaver, beaver.

16:05.948 --> 16:08.696
Yeah, nice try.
That one's covered in piss too.

16:08.910 --> 16:10.645
Fine. You win.

16:10.745 --> 16:12.313
Beavers piss all over everything.

16:12.413 --> 16:13.690
Are you happy?

16:13.790 --> 16:15.233
I don't see any beavers.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.734
- Oh, my God!
- What?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.532
- I'm scared.
- It's gonna be okay.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.298
We're just gonna back up real slowly.

16:37.939 --> 16:39.882
Thank you so much.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.593
Well, look at you
three little heifers.

16:42.693 --> 16:45.054
I think you just might
have saved our lives.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.723
That's doubtful.

16:46.823 --> 16:49.559
Bears don't usually attack more
than one or two folks at a time.

16:49.659 --> 16:51.185
You'd be three.

16:51.285 --> 16:53.479
Of course, if you'd have
taken a step in his direction

16:53.579 --> 16:55.280
he might have hightailed it.

16:55.498 --> 16:58.401
Well, better safe than sorry then.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.293
Yeah.

17:01.337 --> 17:02.655
You girls from out of town?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.241
My name is Mary. Mary Daughtry.

17:05.340 --> 17:08.009
We're stayin' over
there at my cousin's place.

17:08.469 --> 17:10.921
- McKellers?
- Yeah. You know 'em?

17:11.556 --> 17:13.257
No.

17:14.976 --> 17:17.770
My name's Smyth, with a Y.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.632
Just in case you girls need
to write me a check one day.

17:24.193 --> 17:25.636
What brings you across the lake?

17:25.736 --> 17:28.188
We were looking for beavers.

17:28.364 --> 17:30.111
Well, hell, ain't we all?

17:32.034 --> 17:35.575
Well, if you see one,
you ought to stay away from it.

17:35.830 --> 17:38.407
They will mess with you.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.109
You look real close,
they'll come out,

17:40.209 --> 17:42.195
peak out just a little
bitty knob out there,

17:42.295 --> 17:45.589
little pink knob,
like a little ol' puppy's dick.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.046
Well, I guess we'll
be more careful then.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.303
You know...

17:52.430 --> 17:54.499
You might want to cover up.

17:54.599 --> 17:57.668
We got decent folk out
in this neighborhood.

17:57.768 --> 17:59.462
Families. You know, kids.

17:59.562 --> 18:00.630
Yeah, we know.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.508
It's just that she lost
her bikini top in the lake.

18:03.608 --> 18:05.968
Talking about all three of you.

18:06.068 --> 18:10.306
Your little bare stomachs,
weird-ass little tattoos.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.892
Okay, he's a creeper.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.812
Yeah. There's probably some
helpless furry little animal

18:15.912 --> 18:18.614
just waiting to get shot.

18:24.587 --> 18:28.032
Well, I've had enough
excitement for one day.

18:28.132 --> 18:30.201
At least you got to see a man, right?

18:30.301 --> 18:32.829
I don't like them there
tattoos and shit.

18:32.929 --> 18:34.580
Shut up, he could hear you.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.474
I don't care.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.090
All right, I got popcorn.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.642
Sing a song...

18:49.737 --> 18:53.516
Is it popcorn or is it popped-corn?

18:53.616 --> 18:55.768
I don't know. Jenn, go long!

18:55.868 --> 18:57.937
Zoe, you're wasting it all.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.981
Okay, whose turn is it?

19:00.081 --> 19:03.568
All right, Jenn.
Would you rather? Go.

19:03.668 --> 19:07.113
Okay. Would you rather

19:07.213 --> 19:09.532
never be able to use a tampon

19:09.632 --> 19:11.534
or never be able to use lipstick?

19:11.634 --> 19:13.286
That is so lame, Jenn.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.662
I've got one.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.706
Are you ready?

19:16.806 --> 19:20.668
Would you rather watch your mom
get murdered by your daddy

19:20.768 --> 19:25.298
or get raped by your daddy
while your mom had to watch?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.133
Zoe, that's awful.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.593
Would you rather?

19:28.693 --> 19:30.394
Answer it.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.105
I guess

19:33.322 --> 19:34.891
get raped by my dad.

19:34.991 --> 19:36.392
- Ew!
- Gross!

19:36.492 --> 19:37.935
What? Would you rather
have your mom die?

19:38.035 --> 19:39.228
I wouldn't do either.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.730
That's so fucking disgusting.

19:40.830 --> 19:42.690
You're sick.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.400
What's the point of
this game anyways?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.694
I don't blame you,
your dad's real hot.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.495
He is.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.247
All right. Home run me. Home run me.

19:58.347 --> 19:59.874
- Ready?
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

20:01.183 --> 20:03.878
Da, da, da, da, dah!

20:03.978 --> 20:07.056
- You missed.
- I did it by the air, bitch.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.925
I'll do it myself.

20:09.025 --> 20:10.009
Whoo!

20:11.193 --> 20:13.262
I got it. Truth or dare.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.473
Y'all can make out
like you did last time.

20:15.573 --> 20:19.101
No, that's no fun unless there's
guys around to make jealous.

20:19.201 --> 20:20.770
That's bullshit.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.105
You liked it and you know it.

20:23.205 --> 20:25.233
Come here, come give me a kiss.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.250
Stop. I didn't even say dare.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.274
What was that?

20:33.174 --> 20:34.408
It's your daddy, Jenn.

20:34.508 --> 20:35.785
Yeah, he's come to collect.

20:35.885 --> 20:37.928
Oh, real funny.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.500
No, seriously, what the fuck is that?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.426
Well,

20:44.685 --> 20:48.013
I'm just gonna have
to go and find out.

20:52.234 --> 20:54.652
Don't open the door.

20:54.945 --> 20:56.817
Hello?

20:57.782 --> 20:59.734
Anybody?

21:00.618 --> 21:03.271
Hey, serial killers,
we've got three hot babes in here

21:03.371 --> 21:06.190
who haven't had sex
in a really long time.

21:06.290 --> 21:09.334
- It could be dangerous out there.
- Ooh!

21:09.794 --> 21:12.417
Zoe, I'm serious.

21:13.339 --> 21:16.292
You know what, Mary?
You're a real buzzkill.

21:20.763 --> 21:23.465
Don't go out there!

21:24.266 --> 21:25.585
Why are there no streetlights?

21:25.685 --> 21:28.421
Because there are no streets.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.973
I hate the country.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.383
Zoe.

21:34.276 --> 21:36.429
What the hell is that?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.055
Should we call the
police or something?

21:38.155 --> 21:40.349
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

21:40.449 --> 21:43.993
It's okay, it's okay.
It was just the wind.

21:44.995 --> 21:47.163
It's locked.

21:47.790 --> 21:48.899
Mary...

21:48.999 --> 21:49.984
It's okay. Just...

21:53.879 --> 21:55.698
Ha, ha!

21:55.798 --> 21:57.366
Tommy! You asshole!

21:57.466 --> 21:58.701
Oh, come on.

21:58.801 --> 22:00.244
It's nice to see you too.

22:00.344 --> 22:02.705
But that wasn't funny.

22:02.805 --> 22:04.415
How did you even get up here?

22:04.515 --> 22:07.843
I'm sorry, babe.
Buck talked me into it.

22:08.811 --> 22:10.713
Yeah, I had to drag his
ass all the way up here

22:10.813 --> 22:11.964
and the whole time he's like,

22:12.064 --> 22:14.717
"Wait, no, wait, Mary said that
we're not supposed to come.

22:14.817 --> 22:16.719
"Mary said that it's
just girl's night.

22:16.819 --> 22:19.889
"Mary wants to just be with
her vagina all weekend."

22:19.989 --> 22:21.432
Shut up, Buck.

22:21.532 --> 22:23.267
Oh, my God, you guys should
have seen y'all's faces.

22:23.367 --> 22:24.977
It was classic.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.778
You were in on this?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.781
Not if it'll make you any madder.

22:37.298 --> 22:39.200
Would any of you ladies
care to come inside

22:39.300 --> 22:42.119
and join me,
'cause there's no beer out here.

22:42.219 --> 22:44.967
This is my cousin's house, you idiot.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.291
How did you even get in there?

22:47.391 --> 22:50.640
Magic. No, bedroom window was open.

22:53.355 --> 22:55.007
Hi, Jenn.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.593
What part of "stay away" do
you guys not understand?

22:57.693 --> 23:00.513
The "stay away" part.
I just don't get it.

23:00.613 --> 23:01.931
You're not invited up here.

23:02.031 --> 23:03.849
Despite whatever this
one may have told you.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.101
Hey, come on, come on.

23:05.201 --> 23:07.687
We parked the car down the
road so you wouldn't hear us.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.356
Besides, we missed you guys.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.942
Mary, I haven't had sex in 36 hours.

23:13.042 --> 23:14.151
You know, when your foot's asleep?

23:14.251 --> 23:15.319
My dick's asleep.

23:15.419 --> 23:16.737
I've got to wake it up.

23:16.837 --> 23:17.780
I have to wake that dick up.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.824
- Wake that dick up. Baby.
- I will.

23:19.924 --> 23:22.076
- I can't even feel it.
- Mary, please.

23:22.176 --> 23:24.128
Mary, please, my dick's asleep.

23:24.261 --> 23:26.122
Wasn't this weekend for everybody?

23:26.222 --> 23:29.596
Yeah, it was until
you fucked it all up.

23:30.059 --> 23:32.294
No, I'm sorry.
You guys have to leave.

23:32.394 --> 23:35.131
But, Mary, they just drove
all the way out here.

23:35.231 --> 23:37.174
This is my house and
I make the rules.

23:37.274 --> 23:39.301
It's fine, Mary. They can stay.

23:39.401 --> 23:40.678
Jenn! Thank you, Jenn!

23:40.778 --> 23:42.805
Give it up for Jenn everybody.

23:42.905 --> 23:44.098
Right?

23:44.198 --> 23:46.851
Jenn, do not let them
bully you into this.

23:46.951 --> 23:50.530
No, really, maybe it will
force me to, you know,

23:50.746 --> 23:54.120
face it head on instead
of running away.

23:54.917 --> 23:55.943
You sure?

23:56.043 --> 23:58.320
Oh, my, goddammit,
she's sure. Come on.

23:58.420 --> 23:59.572
Come on, we're all adults here.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.157
This doesn't have to be awkward.

24:01.257 --> 24:03.367
Gentlemen, I'll see
you in the bone zone.

24:03.467 --> 24:05.870
Let's get drunk.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.796
Whoo!

24:09.723 --> 24:11.424
- Ow!
- Right.

24:11.934 --> 24:14.503
Well, at least this can't
get any more awkward.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.736
Oh, I feel like a power ranger!

24:33.163 --> 24:35.483
Oh! Oh, shit, you are sweet!

24:35.583 --> 24:37.026
You are way too hot for me!

24:37.126 --> 24:38.611
Oh, baby! You know it!

24:38.711 --> 24:40.708
This was helpful.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.657
Thanks for stopping by.

24:43.757 --> 24:44.700
Baby.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.660
Don't call me that.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.162
You've lost your baby privileges.

24:48.262 --> 24:49.455
But it's not as bad as you think.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.677
You've no idea what I think.

24:51.807 --> 24:53.292
Can we at least talk about it?

24:53.392 --> 24:55.669
Fine. Want to talk about it?

24:55.769 --> 24:58.642
Who is she?
Do I know this little whore?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.635
What is that? Seaweed?

25:02.735 --> 25:04.386
It's you, you asshole.

25:04.486 --> 25:05.971
A friend of a friend
tagged you on Facebook

25:06.071 --> 25:08.265
from Michelles party last weekend.

25:08.365 --> 25:09.475
Who is she?

25:09.575 --> 25:11.143
I know it looks bad. I do.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.536
I know. But I was really drunk.

25:13.829 --> 25:15.606
You know what, if you're not
gonna answer my questions

25:15.706 --> 25:18.234
then we have nothing
else to talk about.

25:18.334 --> 25:19.693
Just, come on...

25:19.793 --> 25:21.710
Don't touch me.

25:22.838 --> 25:24.539
You feel better?

25:26.091 --> 25:28.589
Getting there.

25:32.014 --> 25:34.637
Let me go. I'll scream.

25:36.185 --> 25:38.387
Join the club.

25:46.195 --> 25:47.763
I missed you so much.

25:49.031 --> 25:50.683
Oh.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.030
Missed you too.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.956
That was worth the
drive up. For sure.

26:06.256 --> 26:08.868
- Again.
- I'm only one man.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.203
It takes an hour to recharge.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.288
Do you not read magazines?

26:14.223 --> 26:16.391
Oh. Oh.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.879
Can you hand me my glasses?

26:19.979 --> 26:21.771
Yeah.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.109
You okay?

26:34.576 --> 26:36.437
Yeah, why?

26:36.537 --> 26:40.286
I don't know. You just
seem a little out of it.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.081
Did you finish?

26:44.753 --> 26:48.582
I guess I'm just worried
about Jenn, that's all.

26:49.967 --> 26:51.759
So, that's a no.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.856
Someone in there?

27:23.125 --> 27:24.234
Buck, I swear to God,

27:24.334 --> 27:25.819
I'm gonna stick that bat up your...

27:35.345 --> 27:36.747
Oh, my God, you have to see them!

27:36.847 --> 27:38.123
- You guys...
- What?

27:38.223 --> 27:39.416
In the bathroom!

27:39.516 --> 27:41.418
- Calm down. What's wrong?
- There's something in there.

27:41.518 --> 27:42.628
Tell me what's wrong!

27:42.728 --> 27:44.171
There's something,
I don't know, like...

27:44.271 --> 27:46.715
Who the fuck is crying
on vacation day?

27:46.815 --> 27:48.592
- What's goin' on?
- What did you do to her?

27:48.692 --> 27:49.885
No, I didn't do anything.

27:49.985 --> 27:52.972
Listen, there's a
beaver in the bathroom.

27:53.072 --> 27:56.016
That's really great news, haven't you been
looking for beavers since we got here?

27:56.116 --> 27:57.476
No, no, there was
something wrong with it.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.728
It was fucking rabid or something.

27:59.828 --> 28:01.814
Well, you know what we should do?

28:01.914 --> 28:04.316
We should capture it and
we'll raise it as our own.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.235
Jenn, you are a really ugly crier.

28:06.335 --> 28:07.778
Go look in the fucking bathroom!

28:07.878 --> 28:09.697
Jenn, I tell you what.
This is getting real ridiculous.

28:09.797 --> 28:10.864
Let's go to the fucking bathroom.

28:10.964 --> 28:12.408
Okay, big daddy Buck's got it.

28:12.508 --> 28:14.755
Here, Jenn, here, Jenn.

28:16.929 --> 28:20.249
Oh, there is no way I'm
drunk enough for this.

28:20.349 --> 28:23.252
You're drunk as any one of the
rest of us, so fucking man up.

28:23.352 --> 28:25.645
Yeah, just man up.

28:27.397 --> 28:29.174
Just be careful.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.772
Pussy. Bein' a pussy.

28:32.528 --> 28:34.304
Jesus. Dude, really? Fuckin' pussy.

28:34.404 --> 28:35.931
- Shut up.
- Bein' a bitch.

28:36.031 --> 28:37.823
Bein' a little bitch about it.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.777
Jenn, there's nothing in here.

28:48.877 --> 28:50.320
I swear. It was right there.

28:50.420 --> 28:51.613
Oh, my God, Jenn.

28:51.713 --> 28:53.615
Is that one of those bathrooms?

28:53.715 --> 28:58.412
Oh, look at me, I'm in a scary,
scary bathroom, Jenn.

28:58.512 --> 29:00.080
Jenn, be honest.
Did you shit in here?

29:04.059 --> 29:05.169
Oh, my God!

29:10.190 --> 29:11.891
Kill it!

29:18.907 --> 29:20.476
How the hell is that
thing still movin'?

29:26.665 --> 29:28.867
That's gnarly.

29:29.793 --> 29:32.291
Someone want to get a garbage bag?

29:42.139 --> 29:44.291
That was rabies?

29:44.391 --> 29:45.793
Yeah, probably.

29:45.893 --> 29:49.004
Then again I've never seen a
real beaver before up close so...

29:49.104 --> 29:50.422
Yeah, me neither.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.467
Well, maybe you should try going
down on me once in a while, Buck.

29:53.567 --> 29:54.510
That was not a normal beaver.

29:54.610 --> 29:55.969
I can tell you that much.

29:56.069 --> 29:59.515
Yeah. Normal beavers have pupils
in their goddam eyes, don't they?

29:59.615 --> 30:01.683
Fucking chicks, come on.

30:01.783 --> 30:04.019
The beaver obviously had something.

30:04.119 --> 30:06.021
Wait, I mean, did it bite anyone?

30:06.121 --> 30:07.993
- Jenn, are you...
- No.

30:08.624 --> 30:11.860
Good. 'Cause I've heard that
rabies shots hurt like a bitch.

30:11.960 --> 30:15.004
Yeah, not to mention the nearest
hospital is 30 miles away.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.615
Maybe we should just go home.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.242
- What?
- Yeah, no. Jenn,

30:18.342 --> 30:19.868
we drove four hours to get here.

30:19.968 --> 30:21.912
My foot's still asleep
from the ride up.

30:22.012 --> 30:23.372
I don't care about your foot, Buck.

30:23.472 --> 30:26.375
You know, we're all just
upset and drunk and...

30:26.475 --> 30:27.876
And horny.

30:27.976 --> 30:29.878
And 6'3", but that's just me.

30:29.978 --> 30:32.422
- Buck, shut the fuck up.
- Okay, you're right.

30:32.522 --> 30:34.007
I think that we should
just sleep on it.

30:34.107 --> 30:36.434
Okay, well,
I'm sleeping with you then.

30:41.823 --> 30:43.809
Yeah, sure, Jenn. Whatever you want.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.019
Guys, we could die tomorrow, okay.

30:46.119 --> 30:47.896
This could be our last night.

30:47.996 --> 30:49.731
This may sound crazy but
we need to have an orgy,

30:49.831 --> 30:52.234
I'm not fucking around.
A safety orgy,

30:52.334 --> 30:56.459
you know, stay together, like in
the old west with the caravans.

31:56.857 --> 31:59.355
Okay, here we go.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.903
Don't let the dog look.

32:02.112 --> 32:03.305
Relax. I'm not going to...

32:03.405 --> 32:05.823
Oh, my God, Mary. Look.

32:07.576 --> 32:09.368
Yuck.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.523
Some wild animal came and took it.

32:13.623 --> 32:15.192
See the footprints.

32:15.292 --> 32:16.777
Come on.

32:16.877 --> 32:19.446
- I don't like this.
- What?

32:19.546 --> 32:22.783
Jenn, come on, we're all the way
out in the middle of the woods.

32:22.883 --> 32:23.992
We tossed something on the porch

32:24.092 --> 32:26.920
and something's glad that we did it.

32:27.137 --> 32:28.789
What are you thinkin'?

32:28.889 --> 32:31.083
All I know is that thing
is dead, guys, come on.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.334
Can we please go swimming now?

32:32.434 --> 32:34.002
Yeah, I second that. Let's go.

32:34.102 --> 32:37.047
You still want to go in the water
after what happened last night?

32:37.147 --> 32:38.840
Last night was in there, okay?

32:38.940 --> 32:40.509
The water's way safer
than in the cabin.

32:40.609 --> 32:43.720
Yeah, come on. It's a beautiful day
and the lake's right over here.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.097
We haven't seen you ladies
in your bikinis yet.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.181
Come on.

32:46.281 --> 32:48.642
You know, we were doing just
fine before you guys showed up.

32:48.742 --> 32:50.018
Jenn, that's not fair.

32:50.118 --> 32:52.271
Yeah. Tommy did kill
that beaver for us.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.231
Yeah. Sorry Sam didn't kill anything

32:54.331 --> 32:57.025
because that would be the only
beaver he's getting this weekend.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.860
Will you please stop
with the beaver jokes?

32:58.960 --> 33:01.003
Why did the beaver cross the road?

33:12.307 --> 33:15.260
Whoo! Attagirl!

33:17.646 --> 33:18.964
Come in, Misery!

33:19.064 --> 33:23.313
Get your ass in the water and join
the rest of the human beings!

33:23.610 --> 33:26.722
Has it ever occurred to any of you
that there might be more beavers?

33:26.822 --> 33:28.807
Has it ever occurred to...

33:28.907 --> 33:32.577
Beavers... Beavers...

33:34.663 --> 33:38.333
So, you seen the mysterious photo?

33:40.877 --> 33:42.988
Of course I've seen it.

33:43.088 --> 33:46.408
I've seen it over 300
times since Wednesday.

33:46.508 --> 33:48.243
She has me analyzin'
every line and ever pixel,

33:48.343 --> 33:51.717
trying to figure out who
it is you're on top of.

33:55.851 --> 33:58.378
Well, I guess it's safe
to say that she,

33:58.478 --> 34:00.395
she doesn't know that it was you.

34:01.398 --> 34:03.975
Are you gonna tell her?

34:04.317 --> 34:06.519
I don't know.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.431
Well, you know, if you just
tell her it was nothing,

34:09.531 --> 34:10.891
she's gonna believe you.

34:10.991 --> 34:12.100
Maybe.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.436
But she'll hate me.

34:14.536 --> 34:16.658
Tell that to my finger.

34:16.996 --> 34:19.199
Are you crazy?

34:23.085 --> 34:26.281
Don't be stupid, Jenn.
Get your ass in the water right now.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.659
Yeah. Come on. Yeah,
peer pressure, Jenn. Come on.

34:29.759 --> 34:31.585
Fine.

34:34.222 --> 34:37.512
You know with all the shit that's
gone down, we haven't talked.

34:38.351 --> 34:41.270
Like you said, it was nothin'.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.007
Besides, I'm with Tommy.

34:44.107 --> 34:46.635
And if you're really lucky,
you'll still be with Jenn.

34:46.735 --> 34:47.803
You happy?

34:47.902 --> 34:49.262
This is the happiest
day of my life, Jenn.

34:49.362 --> 34:53.107
You're in the lake. I don't know
how it happened, but it did.

34:57.746 --> 35:00.865
- Oh, my God.
- What?

35:01.082 --> 35:02.859
Something just swam past my foot.

35:05.587 --> 35:08.156
You are, like, such a hypochondriac.

35:08.256 --> 35:11.576
No, I swear to God, you guys,
something just fucking hit my foot.

35:12.844 --> 35:13.829
Oh!

35:13.929 --> 35:15.997
Oh, look, Buck feels it too.

35:17.641 --> 35:19.342
Wait.

35:21.102 --> 35:22.754
- You swallow some water?
- My foot!

35:22.854 --> 35:24.840
Holy shit!

35:24.940 --> 35:26.341
Oh, my God!

35:26.441 --> 35:27.634
Get out of the water!

35:27.734 --> 35:29.811
Oh, my God!

35:31.446 --> 35:34.319
- What the fuck?
- Is that blood?

35:37.202 --> 35:40.496
Get to the raft!
Get to the fucking raft!

35:42.999 --> 35:44.700
Hurry!

35:58.306 --> 36:00.178
Oh, fuck, he got me too!

36:02.477 --> 36:03.503
No.

36:03.603 --> 36:04.880
Fuck!

36:04.980 --> 36:07.353
That was another fuckin' beaver!

36:07.566 --> 36:08.717
More than one.

36:08.817 --> 36:09.801
Beavers don't do this.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.970
They don't just... They don't
just attack people like this.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.054
Oh, my God.

36:15.657 --> 36:17.225
We have to tie this off right now.

36:17.325 --> 36:19.394
- What about this?
- No, no, no, too small, too small.

36:19.494 --> 36:20.645
Wait.

36:20.745 --> 36:22.397
The dog's vest.

36:22.497 --> 36:24.191
- Yeah, yeah, perfect, perfect.
- Hurry!

36:28.169 --> 36:29.237
Look!

36:32.215 --> 36:34.167
Where's Jenn?

36:34.843 --> 36:36.840
Jenn!

36:41.891 --> 36:43.592
Shit.

36:48.023 --> 36:49.216
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

36:50.984 --> 36:51.968
They're coming.

36:52.068 --> 36:54.054
Shit.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.940
Where did they go?

37:06.207 --> 37:08.109
Shit!

37:08.209 --> 37:09.945
They're underneath us!

37:13.006 --> 37:14.824
No!

37:22.432 --> 37:24.133
Be careful!

37:30.106 --> 37:31.174
Hold on people.

37:31.274 --> 37:32.384
We cannot stay here.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.468
Yeah, no shit!

37:40.575 --> 37:42.447
Hold on, hold on.

37:44.371 --> 37:46.356
There's too many of them.

37:52.587 --> 37:53.613
Oh, my God!

37:53.713 --> 37:54.948
We have to swim for it.

37:55.048 --> 37:56.283
We need a diversion.

37:57.550 --> 37:58.660
What the fuck!

37:58.760 --> 38:01.383
All right. You know what?

38:01.721 --> 38:03.582
Sorry buddy. Surf's up!

38:05.266 --> 38:07.218
Gosling!

38:08.770 --> 38:10.338
Gosling!

38:10.438 --> 38:12.139
No!

38:13.983 --> 38:16.151
No!

38:19.489 --> 38:21.474
We have to go, go now!

38:21.574 --> 38:23.491
Go, go.

38:26.454 --> 38:28.656
Shit! Swim!

38:30.083 --> 38:32.251
Go, go! Swim!

39:08.371 --> 39:10.914
Oh, my God!

39:30.268 --> 39:32.766
This doesn't make any goddamn sense.

39:33.062 --> 39:35.632
This is the same one
from the bathroom.

39:35.732 --> 39:38.051
Is he like on steroids or something?

39:38.151 --> 39:40.095
Mary, does it look like
a baseball player?

39:40.195 --> 39:41.763
I don't know, Zoe.

39:41.863 --> 39:44.406
I mean, how could it still be alive?

39:44.699 --> 39:45.934
It isn't.

39:46.034 --> 39:46.976
What?

39:47.076 --> 39:49.396
It isn't alive.

39:49.496 --> 39:51.856
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

39:51.956 --> 39:53.657
All right, enough talk.

39:54.417 --> 39:56.319
What are you doing?

39:56.419 --> 39:58.917
- This.
- Oh, Jesus.

40:00.089 --> 40:01.790
Any questions?

40:11.559 --> 40:14.629
There's still no dial tone.

40:14.729 --> 40:17.022
What? Did the beavers do it?

40:17.190 --> 40:19.634
For all we know, the dial tone
wasn't even on to begin with.

40:19.734 --> 40:21.435
You okay?

40:24.030 --> 40:27.324
Now, look, I am sorry, about the dog.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.364
About the dog?

40:29.702 --> 40:31.062
It's my dog.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.205
You killed my dog.

40:33.706 --> 40:38.445
It's between us and a... and a dog,
I'm going to pick us every time.

40:38.545 --> 40:41.623
If that makes me an asshole,
then so be it, man.

40:41.756 --> 40:43.408
It does.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.209
Asshole!

40:45.927 --> 40:47.495
Oh, give me a break. It's a dog.

40:47.595 --> 40:49.539
Fuck you! I hate you. I hate...

40:49.639 --> 40:51.166
Get off of me, Mary!

40:51.266 --> 40:52.876
- Stop.
- You stop!

40:52.976 --> 40:54.043
You would take his side.

40:54.143 --> 40:56.004
I'm not taking anyone's side.

40:56.104 --> 40:58.477
Oh, yeah? Tell that to Jenn.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.429
Mary, what is she talking about?

41:04.529 --> 41:06.276
That's right, Jenn.

41:06.781 --> 41:09.324
The girl in the stupid
picture with Sam,

41:09.784 --> 41:11.485
it's fucking Mary.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.281
Thanks, Zoe.

41:17.792 --> 41:21.245
She has a right to know.
Everybody else does for fuck's sake!

41:25.425 --> 41:27.076
I didn't know.

41:27.176 --> 41:28.877
Tommy.

41:30.638 --> 41:32.339
Jenn,

41:32.640 --> 41:34.341
I was going to tell you.

41:34.642 --> 41:36.343
It doesn't matter.

41:37.270 --> 41:38.546
We have bigger problems now.

41:44.402 --> 41:45.386
It's them, isn't it?

41:45.486 --> 41:46.721
Oh, you think? They're everywhere.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.392
Make it stop.

41:51.492 --> 41:54.020
It has to be some sort of
intimidation tactic or something.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.188
Well, it's working.

41:55.288 --> 41:57.035
Oh, my God!

41:59.042 --> 42:00.743
Oh, my God!

42:02.337 --> 42:03.655
Son of a bitch!

42:10.345 --> 42:12.247
Is this what you want?

42:12.347 --> 42:14.048
You fucks!

42:31.157 --> 42:33.351
They're just out there
waiting for us.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.603
We've got to get Buck to a hospital.

42:35.703 --> 42:37.450
What about the neighbor's place?

42:37.580 --> 42:39.399
Yeah, we could use their phone.

42:39.499 --> 42:41.025
Oh, fuck that.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.110
I'll go for the car.

42:42.210 --> 42:43.444
Fuck that too.

42:43.544 --> 42:44.696
You stay here with the girls then.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.823
I'll get Buck to a hospital
and send back help.

42:46.923 --> 42:48.366
Give me Buck's foot.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.411
I'm going with you.

42:51.511 --> 42:53.212
No, Zoe, you can't.

42:54.222 --> 42:55.623
I have to.

42:55.723 --> 42:56.708
Ew.

42:56.808 --> 42:57.959
They could be out there.

42:58.059 --> 43:01.129
They are out there, but like
you said, we don't have a choice.

43:01.229 --> 43:03.602
Buck is clearly not going to
make it through the night.

43:04.065 --> 43:06.438
There's got to be some other way.

43:07.235 --> 43:08.595
Look. Beavers are great swimmers

43:08.695 --> 43:10.305
but they're not that
fast on land, okay?

43:10.405 --> 43:12.527
Those things out there

43:12.699 --> 43:14.400
they're not beavers.

43:15.243 --> 43:18.028
I'm going to need your car 'cause
ours is down the road a ways.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.031
Give me the keys.

43:22.583 --> 43:23.985
Tommy, you don't have to do this.

43:24.085 --> 43:25.403
Mary.

43:25.503 --> 43:27.204
It's okay.

43:27.463 --> 43:29.164
Give me the keys.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.213
Tommy?

43:36.431 --> 43:38.124
Come on.

43:38.224 --> 43:39.876
Come on baby.

43:39.976 --> 43:41.928
Get the door.

43:46.190 --> 43:47.342
I don't see anything. You?

43:47.442 --> 43:49.052
My eyes are closed.

43:49.152 --> 43:50.136
All right, let's go. Come on.

43:50.236 --> 43:51.937
Wait.

43:57.326 --> 43:58.519
Hurry, hurry!

43:58.619 --> 44:00.320
Get the door.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.106
Hurry, you better get in!

44:02.206 --> 44:03.900
Better hurry.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.701
They're in.

44:07.295 --> 44:08.279
Come on, come on.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.198
It's a fucking hybrid.
You have to finesse it.

44:12.633 --> 44:14.334
They made it.

44:14.969 --> 44:17.012
Maybe we should've
just gone with them.

44:17.430 --> 44:19.131
Yeah, maybe.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.552
Maybe we should just leave.

44:26.147 --> 44:27.848
Oh, no.

44:29.525 --> 44:31.219
Will somebody help me?

44:31.319 --> 44:33.862
God, you really are a pussy. Move!

44:36.407 --> 44:39.185
We've got to board up
all of these windows.

44:39.285 --> 44:41.282
I'll do the heavy lifting.

44:41.412 --> 44:43.785
You girls are safe with me.

44:45.333 --> 44:46.901
Did you hear something?

44:47.001 --> 44:48.444
Did I hear what?

44:48.544 --> 44:50.712
Banging? Hollering?

44:51.089 --> 44:54.867
Oh, it's just those kids scissoring
each other to Lady Gaga.

44:54.967 --> 44:56.869
Well, I know it's those kids.

44:56.969 --> 45:00.218
Well, what do you want me
to do about it? Call the police?

45:00.348 --> 45:02.542
Well, I heard tires screeching.

45:02.642 --> 45:05.086
You think we ought to go over
there and check up on them?

45:05.186 --> 45:08.184
You never did know when
to mind your own business.

45:09.232 --> 45:11.926
And you never did know
when to get up off your ass.

45:12.026 --> 45:13.678
You really want me to go over there

45:13.778 --> 45:16.230
and check on a bunch
of college girls?

45:16.489 --> 45:19.934
Because you know I might just
have to stay for their party.

45:20.334 --> 45:22.836
Eww. Pig.

45:40.638 --> 45:41.956
Buck?

45:42.056 --> 45:43.249
How you doing there, man?

45:43.349 --> 45:44.375
You hanging with us?

45:44.475 --> 45:46.461
Oh, God.

45:46.561 --> 45:47.962
It's okay, buddy. Hey, hey, hey!

45:48.062 --> 45:50.131
Stay with us, stay with us, Buck.

45:50.231 --> 45:52.008
Everything's gonna be good, alright?

45:52.108 --> 45:53.551
Oh!

45:53.651 --> 45:55.178
Shit.

45:55.278 --> 45:57.605
- What the fuck?
- Fuck!

45:59.949 --> 46:02.894
- Oh, no! Oh, fuck!
- They did this!

46:02.994 --> 46:04.695
Fuck!

46:05.246 --> 46:07.289
Suck a bag of dicks!

46:07.498 --> 46:09.400
Shit. Fuck!

46:09.500 --> 46:11.668
There's no way around this.

46:13.379 --> 46:15.080
Look!

46:15.298 --> 46:18.785
Oh, shit. Shit, wait here,
I'm gonna go check it out.

46:18.885 --> 46:20.586
Be careful!

46:21.762 --> 46:23.634
Hello?

46:25.474 --> 46:26.751
There's no one here.

46:26.851 --> 46:28.552
What are you doing?

46:31.856 --> 46:33.966
There's guns and one ax.

46:34.066 --> 46:35.892
Are you gonna steal them?

46:36.611 --> 46:38.179
Yeah, whatever, we'll borrow 'em.

46:38.279 --> 46:40.652
I promise, I'll bring 'em right back.

46:41.833 --> 46:42.631
Here.

46:42.731 --> 46:44.018
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

46:44.118 --> 46:47.063
- Just take it. Please.
- Should we go back to the cabin?

46:47.163 --> 46:49.786
- No, just you guys.
- What? Wait!

46:50.541 --> 46:52.693
Go get some more guns,
load up the trunk

46:52.793 --> 46:54.028
and get everybody back to the cabin.

46:54.128 --> 46:56.656
Please, get in the car
and turn it around.

46:56.756 --> 46:58.366
Wait. What are you gonna do?

46:58.466 --> 47:00.668
I'm gonna go ahead on
foot and get some help.

47:00.768 --> 47:01.863
You're insane, Tommy.

47:01.963 --> 47:04.863
Zoe, please just get
in the car and hurry.

47:07.350 --> 47:09.051
Zoe?

47:10.478 --> 47:13.306
I'm sorry I never ate your pussy.

47:14.523 --> 47:17.646
I'm gonna go back and
eat all of it one day.

47:18.653 --> 47:20.721
It's okay, baby. We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

47:20.821 --> 47:23.615
It just smells so bad down there.

47:25.826 --> 47:29.996
Tommy? Tommy!

47:32.500 --> 47:35.453
No!

47:41.342 --> 47:43.089
No!

47:51.811 --> 47:53.504
You!

47:53.604 --> 47:55.590
Looks like you're hemmed in
a little bit. Let's take my truck.

47:55.690 --> 47:57.175
We have to save my boyfriend.

47:57.275 --> 47:59.602
Well, come on. Let's get
him and get out of here.

48:00.861 --> 48:02.562
Come on, sweetie!

48:05.658 --> 48:07.018
Here, get in.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.654
Damn beavers.

48:13.666 --> 48:15.913
I thought I told you to cover up?

48:23.801 --> 48:25.578
They sound like babies.

48:25.678 --> 48:28.597
Yeah, crazy fucking babies.

48:34.395 --> 48:36.517
Nails, nails, nails, nails, nails.

48:40.318 --> 48:42.053
Towards me.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.854
No, duh.

48:44.238 --> 48:46.906
Come out to the lake,
have a few laughs.

48:47.908 --> 48:49.609
Dammit.

48:53.831 --> 48:55.532
No!

49:04.800 --> 49:06.285
What? What happened?

49:06.385 --> 49:08.371
You do realize that the
whole point of a beaver

49:08.471 --> 49:09.789
is that it fucking chomps wood.

49:09.889 --> 49:11.290
Oh, well, if you want me
to cover the whole house

49:11.390 --> 49:13.808
with sheet metal, just say the word.

49:21.275 --> 49:24.262
<i>This just in. If you are
receiving this broadcast,</i>

49:24.362 --> 49:28.015
<i>barricade your doors and windows
and do not leave your home.</i>

49:28.115 --> 49:30.101
<i>Unless you want the
deal of the century!</i>

49:30.201 --> 49:32.103
Come on down to Ashland Toyota!

49:32.203 --> 49:33.904
Damn radio.

49:36.624 --> 49:40.828
Back in the '70s,
the beaver fever hit.

49:43.005 --> 49:45.457
Scared up the whole damn county.

49:46.634 --> 49:48.335
Beaver fever?

49:48.928 --> 49:52.302
Caused by the Giardia parasite.

49:52.765 --> 49:54.591
Beavers carry it.

49:55.351 --> 49:57.052
Affects people too.

49:58.896 --> 50:00.381
Affects them how?

50:00.481 --> 50:03.980
Oh, diarrhea mostly.

50:05.653 --> 50:08.276
What does it have to do
with what's going on here?

50:08.823 --> 50:10.474
Any of you guys got diarrhea?

50:10.574 --> 50:13.436
- No.
- Well, now that's good.

50:13.536 --> 50:15.237
Doesn't matter anyway.

50:15.538 --> 50:17.523
Whatever these beavers got out here,

50:17.623 --> 50:19.870
I ain't seen nothing like it before.

50:21.335 --> 50:23.321
Yeah, no kidding, mister.

50:23.421 --> 50:25.964
Caught one in a trap,
early this morning,

50:26.841 --> 50:28.884
only it weren't dead.

50:29.677 --> 50:33.347
And trust me, it shoulda
been real dead.

50:45.651 --> 50:46.886
They're leaving.

50:49.447 --> 50:50.514
Why?

50:50.614 --> 50:51.891
How the hell should I know?

50:51.991 --> 50:53.692
Wait, listen.

50:55.035 --> 50:56.736
It's a truck.

50:56.871 --> 50:58.868
- It's Zoe!
- What?

51:01.709 --> 51:02.651
And Buck!

51:02.751 --> 51:04.278
How did they get back so fast?

51:04.378 --> 51:05.905
Maybe they brought help?

51:06.005 --> 51:07.957
Or something went wrong.

51:10.551 --> 51:12.828
There's someone else.
Wait, is it that hunter guy?

51:12.928 --> 51:14.038
What hunter guy?

51:14.138 --> 51:15.206
Do you see Tommy?

51:15.306 --> 51:16.540
Grab the cane.
Wait for me, wait for me!

51:16.640 --> 51:18.167
Shit, we need to get the
boards off the door.

51:18.267 --> 51:19.835
Are you sure that's a good idea?

51:19.935 --> 51:21.796
Are you kidding?
Get over here and help us.

51:21.896 --> 51:25.758
I don't know if you know but those
things can come back in here

51:25.858 --> 51:27.559
and then we're all dead.

51:28.903 --> 51:30.604
Fuck me.

51:34.283 --> 51:35.976
Baby, come on.

51:36.076 --> 51:37.777
Get there.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.198
Open up!

51:42.666 --> 51:43.859
The doors all boarded up.

51:43.959 --> 51:45.653
- Why?
- You know why the fuck why!

51:45.753 --> 51:47.071
Well, hurry up.

51:47.171 --> 51:49.407
You guys. Hey, you guys.

51:49.507 --> 51:51.800
Hey you guys,
you'd better turn around!

51:58.265 --> 51:59.917
Filthy, hairy beavers.

52:02.144 --> 52:04.562
Baby, come on.
Get up, get up, get up!

52:09.276 --> 52:11.762
Run. Run!

52:11.862 --> 52:14.314
Hurry! Come on, baby.

52:15.491 --> 52:17.238
Sons of bitches.

52:22.873 --> 52:25.359
It's okay, baby. Come on.

52:25.459 --> 52:28.195
Just a little bit further. Come on.

52:29.713 --> 52:32.336
They're not gonna make it.
There's too many of 'em.

52:43.185 --> 52:46.464
Come on baby, up, up, up! You got it!

52:46.564 --> 52:48.607
They made it.

52:48.732 --> 52:50.433
Come on, baby.

52:53.821 --> 52:55.347
Tommy's okay, right?

52:55.447 --> 52:58.491
Yeah. I'm sure he's
still out getting help.

52:58.784 --> 53:02.112
Right. Cause there's no
reason to think otherwise.

53:07.501 --> 53:09.202
Hello?

53:11.505 --> 53:12.740
Maybe they're not home.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.133
Yeah, that'd be wishful thinking.

53:52.755 --> 53:56.334
They couldn't be biting through the
phone lines on purpose, could they?

53:57.509 --> 54:00.955
Can't say for certain.
Beavers like to chew on shit,

54:01.055 --> 54:03.007
especially twigs, branches,

54:03.682 --> 54:05.209
blades of grass and such.

54:05.309 --> 54:07.852
I suppose wires fit the bill as well.

54:08.562 --> 54:11.264
The phone in the cabin.

54:11.732 --> 54:13.524
It didn't work either.

54:15.903 --> 54:18.731
Stay here. I'll check upstairs.

54:25.371 --> 54:28.369
When was the last time you
picked up an actual book?

54:29.041 --> 54:30.484
In class.

54:30.584 --> 54:32.456
You should really try it some time.

54:34.672 --> 54:38.409
- "Beavers are herbivores."
- Great book.

54:38.509 --> 54:41.132
Why don't you try looking
up zombie beavers?

54:42.788 --> 54:44.150
"They live in family
groups or colonies

54:44.251 --> 54:46.250
and will defend their lodge
against other beavers."

54:46.350 --> 54:49.803
Oh, oh, you think the beavers think
that they're, that we're other beavers?

54:49.937 --> 54:51.638
The fuck?

54:52.898 --> 54:55.521
"Keen senses of hearing,
smell and touch.

54:56.235 --> 55:00.109
- "They live up to 24 years."
- Just like us.

55:00.948 --> 55:05.073
I mean, if we don't
make it out of here.

55:06.328 --> 55:09.823
- "They're monogamous."
- Not like us.

55:12.543 --> 55:14.244
Jenn,

55:15.129 --> 55:17.206
it was just,

55:17.464 --> 55:19.791
it was just one of those things.

55:20.426 --> 55:22.469
So you're saying it was a mistake?

55:24.096 --> 55:25.539
Don't answer.

55:25.639 --> 55:26.707
You just did.

55:26.807 --> 55:28.375
Look...

55:28.475 --> 55:32.429
Once the three of us are
far away from this cabin,

55:32.563 --> 55:33.797
we can sit down like adults

55:33.897 --> 55:37.191
and we can try to figure out why
you both find me attractive.

55:42.656 --> 55:45.142
Jenn, you have every
reason to hate me.

55:45.242 --> 55:46.943
Why him?

55:49.329 --> 55:51.315
I don't know.

55:51.415 --> 55:53.116
Listen,

55:53.333 --> 55:56.411
we cannot turn against
each other right now.

55:56.754 --> 55:59.377
That is exactly what the
beavers would want.

56:00.841 --> 56:02.758
Let me see this.

56:06.847 --> 56:10.668
"Animal behaviorists have found beavers
to be gentle, reasoning creatures

56:10.768 --> 56:13.391
"that like to play practical jokes.

56:14.646 --> 56:18.065
"They are considered to be
excellent at building tunnels."

56:27.701 --> 56:30.620
I seriously need to lie down.

56:36.376 --> 56:38.077
Okay.

56:41.548 --> 56:43.420
All clear upstairs.

56:44.009 --> 56:47.079
Appears the beavers have left
the premises for the time being.

56:47.179 --> 56:49.051
What about the old lady?

56:49.348 --> 56:53.097
Well, she's still in bed
what's left of her, anyway.

56:53.644 --> 56:55.345
What you got there?

56:56.271 --> 56:57.972
Sandwich?

56:58.857 --> 57:00.634
No, it's Buck's foot.

57:00.734 --> 57:03.607
We're keeping it on ice
so we could reattach it.

57:04.238 --> 57:06.473
That's what we're supposed
to do, right? Keep it on ice?

57:06.573 --> 57:08.976
Well, not directly on ice.
It kills the tissue.

57:09.076 --> 57:11.687
Well, shit! Well, what shall I do?
Shall I wrap it in a towel or something?

57:11.787 --> 57:14.364
Well, I suppose that depends
on when it came off.

57:14.540 --> 57:17.834
I... I don't know. This afternoon,
maybe four or five hours ago.

57:18.794 --> 57:22.794
Technically, I guess there's a chance
that they can sew that sucker back on.

57:22.923 --> 57:25.617
We'd have to be at the hospital within
the hour but that ain't gonna happen.

57:25.717 --> 57:29.011
Might as well just chuck the
damn thing and call it a day.

57:30.055 --> 57:31.874
I'm sorry. Do you want some chicken?

57:31.974 --> 57:33.917
There's plenty of it in
the fridge over there.

57:34.017 --> 57:36.378
I don't want any chicken.
We need to go to the hospital now.

57:36.478 --> 57:39.173
Well, you know as well as I do

57:39.273 --> 57:42.342
that road's blocked. We sure as
hell can't get through on foot

57:42.442 --> 57:44.143
in pitch dark.

57:44.778 --> 57:47.105
With or without
carrying the big fella.

57:49.157 --> 57:53.737
Plus, beavers are generally
more active at night.

57:54.538 --> 57:58.538
So I suggest maybe we hole
up here till the morning,

57:58.750 --> 58:02.488
then one or two of us
can make a go at it.

58:02.588 --> 58:04.531
He could bleed to death overnight.

58:04.631 --> 58:09.837
Yeah, well. I could always
cauterize the stump.

58:10.804 --> 58:12.676
You sure you don't want some chicken?

58:15.100 --> 58:16.801
I'm not hungry.

58:41.668 --> 58:43.460
Jenn?

58:58.477 --> 59:01.054
You never cared that
Sam cheated, did you?

59:01.855 --> 59:03.932
You only cared that it was me.

59:07.694 --> 59:09.263
Jenn, I know that we've
been through a lot but this

59:09.363 --> 59:11.235
isn't going to solve anything.

59:11.531 --> 59:13.448
I love you, really, but

59:13.575 --> 59:16.073
I... I just don't think
of you this way.

59:46.483 --> 59:48.730
Come on. Come on, let's go.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.446
You've done this before, right?

01:00:01.456 --> 01:00:03.157
No, ma'am.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:05.652
But I've seen it on
television many a time.

01:00:05.752 --> 01:00:07.749
It's okay.

01:00:15.387 --> 01:00:17.714
All right. What the fuck was that?

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.564
Buck!

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:45.996
Son of a bitch!

01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:52.340
Buck! No!

01:01:09.608 --> 01:01:11.525
Fuck.

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:21.986
No!

01:01:22.704 --> 01:01:24.747
Oh, no! Fuck!

01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:48.422
- What is she doing in there?
- I don't know.

01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:58.265
Its got to be some kind of virus
transmitted by the beavers.

01:01:58.365 --> 01:01:59.599
Oh, no shit!

01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:03.478
Did you hear her?
Did you fucking see her face?

01:02:03.578 --> 01:02:04.980
Do you think that we can help her?

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.189
I mean, do you think it's permanent?

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:09.868
I don't know. She's gonna be on
medication for the rest of her life.

01:02:11.253 --> 01:02:13.321
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Are you bit? Are you scratched?

01:02:13.421 --> 01:02:15.323
- I'm fine.
- Take off your shirt.

01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:17.576
- Why?
- Just take your fucking shirt off.

01:02:17.676 --> 01:02:18.827
Calm down.

01:02:43.577 --> 01:02:45.771
You fucking bitch!

01:03:08.435 --> 01:03:09.920
Fuck!

01:03:36.504 --> 01:03:38.205
All right.

01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.502
Come on, come on, come on!

01:03:50.018 --> 01:03:52.095
They're fucking everywhere!

01:03:53.104 --> 01:03:54.214
Oh, the truck!

01:03:54.314 --> 01:03:56.049
The truck. It was still
running, last time I checked.

01:03:56.149 --> 01:03:58.066
I'm not gonna make a run for it.

01:03:58.318 --> 01:04:00.011
- Mary.
- Take off your shirt.

01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:02.233
- Why?
- Take off your fucking shirt!

01:04:08.495 --> 01:04:10.196
Satisfied?

01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:13.161
Now take off the rest.

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:22.917
Zombie beavers running around
but what the fuck do we care?

01:04:27.514 --> 01:04:29.591
Turn around.

01:04:33.645 --> 01:04:35.714
- You done?
- I guess so.

01:04:35.814 --> 01:04:37.515
Your turn.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.151
What's this?

01:05:00.922 --> 01:05:03.241
Mary, I promise I'm gonna
get us out of here.

01:05:03.341 --> 01:05:05.588
Don't talk.

01:05:13.935 --> 01:05:16.888
- I want to take my glasses off.
- No, no. It's hot, it's hot.

01:05:20.567 --> 01:05:22.969
- Do you smell something?
- What?

01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:26.443
- Smoke, smoke, I smell smoke.
- Okay. I'll take care of it.

01:05:43.757 --> 01:05:45.458
Oh, God!

01:05:48.595 --> 01:05:50.421
Oh. Fuck me.

01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:09.148
Get in!

01:06:10.784 --> 01:06:13.282
- Where's Jenn?
- They're all dead. Just go!

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.583
We're getting the fuck out of here.

01:06:28.343 --> 01:06:30.287
Oh, shit, Zoe!

01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:32.088
Get down!

01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:36.050
Zoe, look out!

01:06:41.815 --> 01:06:43.983
Are you okay?

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.811
Yeah.

01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:54.227
Oh, I think we woke the neighbors.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:59.161
- Go! Go!
- I'm trying.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.402
Go! Go! Go!

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:04.203
Fucking go!

01:07:10.844 --> 01:07:12.591
I mean, really?

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:26.892
Is this truck fucking
covered in honey?

01:07:54.888 --> 01:07:57.386
I never liked that bitch anyway.

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.578
Why are we stopping?

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:26.993
It's okay, Mary.

01:08:27.212 --> 01:08:30.040
The trees are down ahead and
we've got to continue on foot.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.925
Come on.

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.725
What?

01:08:52.904 --> 01:08:55.197
It's nothing. Just keep going.

01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:58.651
We're gonna have
to go behind the car.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.903
We have to go around it.

01:09:01.246 --> 01:09:05.496
Come on. You're okay now, Mary.
We're gonna make it.

01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:07.413
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:07.627 --> 01:09:09.920
We just need to go a little further.

01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:13.332
Mary, what are you doing?

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:20.430
Where did you get that?

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:22.258
The glove compartment.

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:27.881
You got bit and we both know that you're
gonna turn into one of those things.

01:09:27.981 --> 01:09:30.479
- No, we don't know that.
- Yes, we do!

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.603
Mary, I feel totally fine, I swear.

01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:36.930
What, is it this?

01:09:37.031 --> 01:09:38.515
I jumped through a fucking window!

01:09:38.616 --> 01:09:41.352
I ran through the woods.
They crushed my foot, I did not get bit!

01:09:41.452 --> 01:09:44.075
You shut up! Do not come
any closer! I mean it.

01:09:45.331 --> 01:09:48.033
You at least have
to wait until I turn,

01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:51.082
or else you'll be a murderer.

01:09:55.717 --> 01:09:59.216
Mary! Mary, no!

01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:16.990
Hey, you see that girl?

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:18.575
Yeah, I see her.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:20.422
I trust you.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.718
- B-mark.
- Okay.

01:11:29.977 --> 01:11:31.678
Beaver fever?

01:11:31.938 --> 01:11:33.506
Yeah.

01:11:33.606 --> 01:11:37.844
Caused by the Giardia parasite.
Beavers carry it.

01:11:40.154 --> 01:11:41.855
Caused by the...

01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:44.517
Fuck.

01:11:44.617 --> 01:11:46.436
Cause by the Giardia parasite.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:49.014
It's very fucking serious shit.

01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:51.733
Let's roll it again. Sorry, Jordan.

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:55.412
We're over there and it's
Saving Private, Privates Ryan.

01:11:56.254 --> 01:11:57.947
Jenn we're up there sucking...

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.450
- And fucking.
- And fucking, fucking, okay?

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.534
And...

01:12:01.634 --> 01:12:02.619
We almost had it.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.204
- We're in there sucking and yes...
- And fucking.

01:12:05.304 --> 01:12:09.709
- Trucking. Keep going.
- I got nothing.

01:12:09.809 --> 01:12:12.557
We're gonna go to Arby's and
get some apple turnovers.

01:12:12.812 --> 01:12:14.513
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:18.259
I got a hand job at
an Arby's one time.

01:12:18.359 --> 01:12:19.385
Oh, yeah?

01:12:19.485 --> 01:12:21.311
Or did I give one?

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.894
Oh, no, the hand.

01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:31.840
Action.

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:39.238
That's gnarly.

01:12:39.338 --> 01:12:40.406
Gnar-ley.

01:12:40.506 --> 01:12:41.449
Gnarl-ley.

01:12:41.549 --> 01:12:42.533
Gnarly.

01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:44.160
Mar-gully!

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.007
Nar-gully?

01:12:47.013 --> 01:12:49.886
The dog's supposed
to be scared of them.

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:54.379
I had a job for a minute as
one of those sign spinners.

01:12:54.479 --> 01:12:56.255
Like, like one of those
sandwich places?

01:12:56.355 --> 01:12:59.050
Yeah. But I had plugged it in,
I put some Christmas lights in it,

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.178
tried to get paid extra,
strangled my penis.

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:03.429
Strangled your penis?
How does that happen?

01:13:03.529 --> 01:13:05.355
You can strangle your penis.

01:13:05.698 --> 01:13:07.225
Were you doing that
flip behind your back

01:13:07.325 --> 01:13:08.726
and it came up around your taint?

01:13:08.826 --> 01:13:12.397
My penis was in a,
was in a rear, naked choke.

01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:15.245
Well, what kind of workman's
comp do you get for that?

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:18.000
You just get fired.

01:13:22.924 --> 01:13:24.367
Can someone pull my glasses down?

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:26.536
- Yep.
- Well, not you.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:32.500
- Okay.
- Do you like the moan?

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.460
Or do you like the...

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.255
- Both.
- I'll do the moan, you do the...

01:13:37.355 --> 01:13:40.299
My mom never loved me,
my mom never loved me.

01:13:40.399 --> 01:13:42.802
Why are you with me?
Why are you with me?

01:13:42.902 --> 01:13:44.345
What do you see in me? I don't know.

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:46.472
That's great.

01:13:46.572 --> 01:13:48.740
Ready, action.

01:13:52.453 --> 01:13:54.450
Well, that is fucked up.

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.401
Cut.

01:14:01.879 --> 01:14:04.991

<i>She tells you why</i>

01:14:09.762 --> 01:14:11.539
<i>You don't believe her</i>

01:14:11.639 --> 01:14:16.252
<i>She saw one in the
bathroom, it's no lie</i>

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.296
<i>It's a Zombeaver</i>

01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:21.716
<i>Contaminated by toxic goo</i>

01:14:21.816 --> 01:14:24.719
<i>A random genetic mistake</i>

<i>They're semi-aquatic</i>

01:14:26.779 --> 01:14:28.055
<i>They're hungry for you</i>

01:15:01.355 --> 01:15:04.300
