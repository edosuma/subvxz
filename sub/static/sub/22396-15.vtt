00:15.707 --> 00:16.707
Huh?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.208
Oh, no!

00:25.041 --> 00:27.124
Minnie, minnie, minnie, minnie,
minnie, minnie! My sock's been stolen!

00:27.124 --> 00:28.749
Oh, no!

00:28.749 --> 00:31.083
Wait a minute.
You don't wear socks.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.832
What? I wear no-shows.

00:34.457 --> 00:36.374
We have to do something!

00:36.374 --> 00:37.582
Red alert, boys!

00:37.582 --> 00:39.124
Sock emergency!

00:39.124 --> 00:41.166
- Ha-ha!
- Ha!

00:41.166 --> 00:44.915
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm...

00:46.457 --> 00:50.291
Tomorrow, everyone will have
a pair of socks again.

00:52.374 --> 00:54.124
Good night, my darlings.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.124
Good morning, my little...

01:18.374 --> 01:22.208
I'll get that rotten sock burglar!

01:23.874 --> 01:24.957
Oh, tea's ready.

01:28.374 --> 01:29.374
Socks.

01:29.707 --> 01:33.083
Everyone had two.
But you only wanted one.

01:33.374 --> 01:36.208
So you kept taking
and taking like a sickness.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.915
A sock sickness!

01:37.915 --> 01:40.000
Until you left everyone in the world...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.249
Single-socked!

01:41.249 --> 01:43.374
Isn't that right...
Buster!

01:44.041 --> 01:45.374
Gulp!
I, I...

01:46.624 --> 01:47.749
I...

01:47.749 --> 01:49.124
I confess!

01:49.124 --> 01:51.790
I drank all the milk
from Mickey's carton!

01:52.166 --> 01:55.666
And I backwashed!

01:56.666 --> 01:58.124
There, there, goofy.

01:59.666 --> 02:01.624
Hey. Someone's
cooking fish.

02:02.124 --> 02:03.208
Oh no!

02:03.208 --> 02:05.541
My sock's been stolen!

02:23.374 --> 02:25.249
Okay boys, string him up!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.083
Pete?

02:36.083 --> 02:38.499
But why would you steal all those socks?

02:38.915 --> 02:42.457
Do you know how hard it is to find a sock

02:42.457 --> 02:43.707
for this?

02:44.874 --> 02:47.374
I searched for years,

02:47.874 --> 02:49.499
but nothing fits.

02:49.499 --> 02:52.541
So, I says, "if I can't have two socks",

02:52.541 --> 02:54.000
"then no one can!"

02:54.624 --> 02:55.749
Hmm...

02:56.832 --> 02:57.832
Ah, ah!

02:58.832 --> 02:59.874
Ta-da!

03:02.416 --> 03:03.166
You, you...

03:03.749 --> 03:05.874
Oh! Thank you, minnie mouse!

03:06.457 --> 03:08.124
Go, be free!

03:15.374 --> 03:16.624
Minnie!

03:18.249 --> 03:21.541
Now, that I got a sock, I can
do's what I always wanted to do's.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.291
Rob banks!

03:28.790 --> 03:29.790
Uh, uh, oops!
