00:11.960 --> 00:14.890
Tonight... Richard wears a blue hat,

00:15.680 --> 00:17.890
James wears a different hat

00:18.430 --> 00:20.920
and I wear a hat with things on it.

00:29.110 --> 00:32.540
Hello! Thank you.

00:34.380 --> 00:40.540
Now, as you may remember, before Christmas 
there was a bit of snow. Everything stopped,

00:40.540 --> 00:48.220
we all ran about waving arms in the air saying, 
"Why in this country do we not have 
more snow ploughs and more gritting machines?"

00:48.220 --> 00:53.940
The main problem of course is cost, especially at the 
moment, because councils everywhere are laying people off.

00:53.940 --> 00:57.260
They cannot very well 
make a whole department redundant

00:57.260 --> 01:00.850
and then spend the ï¿¡90,000 
they have saved on a snow plough.

01:00.850 --> 01:06.400
Especially if the snow plough is just going to be sitting
around. It might not be needed for five years. Exactly.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.900
So, what is to be done?

01:08.900 --> 01:14.330
Well, this is the combine harvester. 
It works 24 hours-a-day through August,

01:14.330 --> 01:17.470
but then it sits idly in the shed 
for the rest of the year. 

01:17.470 --> 01:22.630
How hard would it be to turn 
this in winter into a snow plough?

01:22.630 --> 01:29.850
To find out, we bought an old model, of this very combine
in fact, and set about making the necessary modifications

01:29.850 --> 01:33.510
at Top Gear's top-secret testing 
facility in Nottinghamshire.

01:33.510 --> 01:39.400
On the B6011, Just North of Bestwood, St Albans.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.980
This is the result of our endeavours.

01:56.850 --> 02:04.570
Straight away you can see we have removed the rotating, 
cutting, harvesty blade thing off the front  
and replaced it with this snow blade.

02:04.570 --> 02:08.050
It is V-shaped, because that makes it 
more easy to cut through the snow.

02:08.050 --> 02:13.100
This should be able to move through 
snow up to three feet deep, no problem.

02:15.900 --> 02:21.030
Power comes from a V8 diesel engine 
which drives these chunky front wheels.

02:21.030 --> 02:27.200
In the snow, as any BMW driver will tell you, 
front-wheel drive is a lot better than rear-wheel-drive.

02:27.720 --> 02:33.070
The combine, when you think about it, it is almost 
as if it was designed with snow clearance in mind.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.490
It is uncanny. Everything about it,

02:34.490 --> 02:39.040
it has the ground clearance, knobbly tyres, 
front-wheel drive, the weight of it, it is all there.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.630
This is one of those times on top gear actually... 

02:43.630 --> 02:46.340
We have accidentally been a bit clever! 
...this might work.

02:48.850 --> 02:56.820
Since the dominator has a top speed of just 12mph, 
it's easy to decide which one of us would be the driver.

02:58.700 --> 03:04.200
What happens if I put it on full? 
BLEEP. I don't like that!

03:05.640 --> 03:08.250
Give it the beans! Faster!

03:09.040 --> 03:11.270
Hang on,  it is not like a rally car.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.260
He is going the wrong way. 
Rear wheel steering, look. 

03:14.970 --> 03:21.740
It is not very sensitive 
steering. BLEEP. Oh, BLEEP.

03:21.740 --> 03:27.100
There is of course, one drawback to 
the combine as a snow plough.

03:27.100 --> 03:32.150
Because it was designed to work in August, 
it has no heater.

03:32.150 --> 03:35.890
Which is why there is a drum in there, 
you can probably see through the window,

03:35.890 --> 03:40.210
and that is an urn. We put that in there.

03:40.210 --> 03:43.750
Full of... Well, we wanted tea, 
but James said 'I want Bovril'.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.440
Because he is in 1950.

03:45.940 --> 03:50.880
We all know that when it is snowing and it is cold, 
you have Bovril. That is a rule of life.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.150
He likes to paint himself all over in it,

03:53.150 --> 03:56.380
it is like baby oil to him. 
That is what he does.

03:57.520 --> 04:02.270
Him and his lorry driver friends, all Bovrilled up, 
and then they slip about. That is what they do!

04:06.460 --> 04:08.650
"Besides attaching a plough on the front,

04:08.650 --> 04:15.110
we also converted the tube that normally shoots 
out the harvested wheat into a makeshift gritter". 

04:18.880 --> 04:22.770
I shall be responsible for shovelling 
the grit from here into this hopper.

04:22.770 --> 04:25.340
I should be good at this, because my first job was

04:25.340 --> 04:27.940
actually shovelling grit 
into a water filtration plant.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.920
Go on then, shovel. Make shovelling.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.680
hile he is doing that, I shall explain my role.

04:33.680 --> 04:43.120
I can use this lever here to swing the 
arm to direct the flow of grit on to 
the pavement or onto the road behind.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.530
Yes, look at this!

04:45.530 --> 04:49.260
Initiating gritting.

04:56.790 --> 05:01.810
Yes! And there was grit! 
We have made a gritting machine!

05:03.160 --> 05:06.450
"But there was one more check we wanted to do".

05:08.790 --> 05:12.250
You know what it is like when you are following 
a gritting lorry on the motorway

05:12.250 --> 05:15.460
you can go 'No, it is turning 
my car into a DeLorean!'

05:15.460 --> 05:17.760
Exactly. So, to make sure this is not too powerful,

05:17.760 --> 05:22.410
we have got Hammond in a car. 
We are going to do a little experiment,

05:22.410 --> 05:25.560
fire the gritter at it, make sure it does not 
actually take the paint off.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.700
will be all right sideways, won't it? Yes, yes.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.480
OK James, engage.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.600
Initiating gritting.

05:40.190 --> 05:44.490
Stop it James, there has been a problem! 
Make it stop!

05:44.490 --> 05:47.030
Gritting ceased.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.460
"Apart from the fact that the grit
would kill the occupants of any car it hit,

05:54.460 --> 05:57.770
we felt that the dominator was ready to start work,

05:59.430 --> 06:01.130
but there was a problem".

06:05.850 --> 06:07.060
It is not going to snow, is it?

06:08.290 --> 06:11.560
"With crossed fingers, we tuned in
to the weather forecast".

06:11.560 --> 06:14.620
Good afternoon... Shh! We are going to
see a change in our weather later on this week.

06:14.620 --> 06:19.570
Temperatures really starting to climb, 
things heading much milder. 
We have had a fair bit of cloud around already...

06:19.570 --> 06:24.390
The good news is there is absolutely no sign
of the cold air returning in the near future,

06:24.390 --> 06:29.360
it is a very mild outlook. 
The reason we have got all this warm air, 
it is pumping up from the tropics.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.420
What does he know?

06:31.420 --> 06:34.650
He does not have to rub it in, does he? 
He sounds all gleeful about it.

06:35.490 --> 06:41.350
"So, if the snow would not come to the dominator, 
we would take the dominator to the snow.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.660
Here in Norway, we decided to clear the
snow from a frozen lake to make a runway

06:51.660 --> 06:55.150
and then a Nor would land his plane on it".

06:57.100 --> 07:00.670
This is quite snowy. It must have snowed.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.860
"We knew the ice would be thick enough 
for a light aircraft, 

07:03.860 --> 07:06.740
but what about our heavy snowbine?".

07:10.910 --> 07:12.520
Ooh, oh. I thought he would be drilling for hours!

07:12.520 --> 07:15.220
That was 10 seconds!

07:15.220 --> 07:17.420
Seriously, has that gone  through? Yes.

07:19.630 --> 07:27.060
Norwegians actually have a chart to say how much 
weight you can put on various thicknesses of ice.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.830
So, how thick is it? 45 centimetres.

07:29.830 --> 07:33.780
Well, say 50... let's say 40. It is 45.

07:33.780 --> 07:37.550
So 50 centimetres of ice, 12 tonnes.

07:37.550 --> 07:41.880
Combine is more than that. It is 13 tonnes.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.960
So, we can't do it? Well it is only a tonne over.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.530
"Bravely, Hammond and the optimistic Jeremy 
decided not to be on board,

07:51.530 --> 07:54.730
as I gingerly drove the snowbine out of the woods,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.070
towards the ice".

08:00.870 --> 08:02.410
Three yards to the lake,

08:03.140 --> 08:04.250
this is it!

08:08.940 --> 08:10.730
I do not like that noise!

08:16.130 --> 08:18.480
"Eventually though, I made it".

08:18.870 --> 08:21.060
I or did I not say we would be all right?

08:21.060 --> 08:25.530
Was that or was that not based entirely on guesswork?

08:28.730 --> 08:32.789
"As my guesswork was correct, we set to work".

08:36.510 --> 08:37.710
We are ploughing.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.700
We are ploughing chaps, look at this.

08:45.740 --> 08:47.690
Here we go!

08:49.660 --> 08:53.070
The snowbinester - it works! Yes!

08:55.390 --> 08:59.500
Come on!

09:01.720 --> 09:02.920
This is.. Oh!

09:05.490 --> 09:07.290
I think we have just gone through it.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.240
Ho-ho, yes we have!

09:09.680 --> 09:13.430
Is not an emergency,
it is just time to empty your bowels. 

09:13.430 --> 09:15.850
Sinking! Sinking!

09:16.610 --> 09:18.730
"Bravely, Jeremy dismounted".

09:19.400 --> 09:20.700
back it up!

09:20.700 --> 09:22.580
"And then he started to issue orders".

09:25.980 --> 09:30.920
That is sinking badly. Put your blade down because
that has just gone through again.

09:31.880 --> 09:36.150
"When the combine finally moved, 
we could see the scale of the peril".

09:39.280 --> 09:41.010
That is 300 metres deep.

09:43.740 --> 09:45.130
It's just water.

09:46.710 --> 09:52.800
"However, unlike the snowplough people at Heathrow
Airport, we decided not to just give up".

09:53.980 --> 09:59.790
Do you know how many flights were cancelled 
in Heathrow last year, because of the weather?

10:01.460 --> 10:02.990
3700.

10:02.990 --> 10:06.630
Do you know how many flights were
cancelled in Oslo because of the weather?

10:08.210 --> 10:09.690
2000? Two.

10:09.690 --> 10:13.870
Heathrow 3700.

10:14.530 --> 10:19.180
"As we were proving, all of that
misery was completely un-necessary".

10:20.600 --> 10:23.990
There really is no excuse. Heathrow, BAA,

10:23.990 --> 10:26.430
if you're watching this, you're pathetic.

10:26.430 --> 10:31.890
And if anybody in a meeting says "Oh well, 
the reason why it was shut is...", sack him.

10:31.890 --> 10:38.690
There is no reason why it was shut because 
it is not difficult to clear a runway. It just is not.

10:39.150 --> 10:43.630
"My rant was interrupted at this point 
by news from below decks".

10:43.630 --> 10:48.420
The Bovril is boiling over.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.890
"Up top, Hammond was still fretting about the ice".

10:55.220 --> 10:59.860
Oh my god, that is another crack there, look. 
Yep. Big one.

11:00.780 --> 11:03.540
When we go through, it is going to be worse for him.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.360
Oh god yes, because he will be pawing a
t the glass, desperate.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.160
"Right now though, he was pawing at the steering wheel".

11:11.830 --> 11:17.910
James, James, go right you idiot! Stay right, 
it is a straight line we are looking for!

11:18.810 --> 11:20.960
I think this will be a tricky landing.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.950
We got into a tank slapper. 

11:23.140 --> 11:27.190
Look where we're pointing. 
James, the trees indicate land.

11:28.260 --> 11:31.600
"Eventually though, 
James are mastered at the rear wheel steering".

11:32.960 --> 11:36.980
I am waiting to look behind us and
see a runway, complete with lights and everything.

11:36.980 --> 11:39.090
That is not happening, but it is not bad, look.

11:39.620 --> 11:43.200
"Pretty soon, the runway was finished.

11:44.850 --> 11:50.310
So we pulled over and radioed the pilot, 
giving him permission to land".

11:51.020 --> 11:56.610
It is not the smoothest runway. 
No, but there is less snow on it than there was.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.610
is smooth enough, isn't it? 
Well we are about to find out. Here he comes.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.510
Look at that, job done.

12:10.510 --> 12:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we did that! How about that.

12:16.070 --> 12:19.480
"Sadly though, our celebrations were premature".

12:21.770 --> 12:24.730
Oh, oh my God. That is quite bumpy.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.900
He has crashed. He has pretty much crashed there.

12:31.610 --> 12:35.240
time like this, 
there is only one thing a man can do.

12:35.240 --> 12:40.480
Right, quick, go! Go go go! Right, James, run!

12:53.470 --> 12:55.890
That was deeply embarrassing.

12:59.610 --> 13:02.220
I know we are often accused of faking 
things on this programme,

13:02.220 --> 13:05.210
but trust me, you cannot actually fake a plane crash.

13:05.210 --> 13:11.080
I think that it is probably safe to say we will 
not be getting a Christmas tree for 
Trafalgar Square this year, from Norway.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.430
Anyway, we will be picking that film up later on. 
We want to explain it is not just a massive cocking around.

13:15.430 --> 13:19.970
We really do believe that 
we were on to something with that snowbine

13:19.970 --> 13:25.030
because if you think about it, if it works, farmers can 
rent out equipment that would normally be sitting idle,

13:25.030 --> 13:29.430
councils do not have to maintain a fleet, 
which savesthem a fortune.

13:29.430 --> 13:31.050
And we get our roads open.

13:31.050 --> 13:33.140
So we really do think 
it is worth persevering with.

13:33.140 --> 13:37.470
Anyway, now, we are going to do the news.
I want to begin by talking about Nissan. 

13:37.470 --> 13:40.500
They have announced they are going to 
make a new electric sports car 

13:40.800 --> 13:43.600
which they are going to exhibit at 
the Geneva Motor Show, which is soon. 

13:43.600 --> 13:45.210
That is a picture of it. 

13:45.210 --> 13:47.920
They have sent us lots of details about this car.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.290
Interestingly and unusually, 
they have also sent us a description 

13:51.290 --> 13:53.190
of the sort of person who will buy it.  

13:53.190 --> 13:56.590
An actual biography. 
I am quoting now from a Nissan themselves. 

13:56.590 --> 13:59.350
They say the driver, Daniel... 

13:59.350 --> 14:01.260
So this guy does not exist, they have made him up? Yes. 

14:01.260 --> 14:06.950
They say "Daniel works in tech but lives for the weekend.  

14:06.950 --> 14:08.690
On a Friday night after work, 

14:08.690 --> 14:10.680
he gets behind the wheels of his Esflow, 

14:10.680 --> 14:13.160
which instantly links with his pocket PDA..." 

14:13.160 --> 14:16.500
he sounds like a bit of a prat. He does. Anyway,

14:16.500 --> 14:19.250
"...it determines the fastest route 
to his girlfriend's home. 

14:19.250 --> 14:22.050
On Sunday, he drives through the mountains for leisure," 

14:24.920 --> 14:27.530
on his milk float. And then he gets home eventually, 

14:27.530 --> 14:30.050
it is all charged up, and he lives in Barcelona. 

14:30.050 --> 14:32.230
Hang on a minute, he's called Daniel? 

14:33.170 --> 14:35.900
Could he be the Daniel from the Elton John song?  

14:35.900 --> 14:38.010
Yes, that is who he was writing about. Hang on. 

14:39.090 --> 14:41.200
# Daniel is travelling tonight.... 

14:41.200 --> 14:46.200
In his stupid electric sports car. 
I can see the red tail lights...# 

14:46.200 --> 14:47.360
No, you would not be able to, would you? 

14:47.360 --> 14:49.660
It is battery-powered, they will have gone flat.  

14:50.150 --> 14:55.400
# Daniel's girlfriend is bouncing around 
on a man with an Aston v8...#

14:56.910 --> 14:58.530
I have just had a thought.  

14:58.530 --> 15:01.630
What is James' middle name? It is Daniel! Yes it is. 

15:04.130 --> 15:05.270
Anyway, that is enough Daniel. 

15:06.690 --> 15:09.350
Bentley have announced that in the next James Bond book, 

15:09.350 --> 15:13.420
007 will be driving a Bentley Continental. 

15:13.420 --> 15:17.180
Wow. Is that the next James Bond? Look at him.

15:17.870 --> 15:22.170
He looks like an accountant. 

15:22.980 --> 15:25.750
What is the book called? 
On her Majesty's Customs and Excise? 

15:26.960 --> 15:30.460
ledger. Live and Let's File.

15:32.220 --> 15:36.110
I should point out that man is the author 
of the book, not the new bond. Sorry. 

15:36.900 --> 15:38.550
I do not know why you would want a modern Bentley anyway, 

15:38.550 --> 15:41.460
I drove one in Albania recently and it was terrible.

15:42.700 --> 15:46.600
I was killed in it. You were! So it was not all bad. 

15:47.210 --> 15:50.990
Now, you know infinity? 
You mean when James explains how something works? 

15:50.990 --> 15:54.270
And infinity just stretches out 
in front of you forever. 

15:54.270 --> 15:58.080
No, not endless time and space, Infinity, 
the Japanese car maker. Oh, yeah.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.370
They are Datsuns with a bit of velvet in them, Basically. 

16:00.370 --> 16:04.400
A bit like Lexus is to Toyota. 
Well, at the Geneva Motor Show, 

16:04.400 --> 16:08.250
they have announced they are going to 
show off a new direction they are going in. 

16:08.250 --> 16:10.910
This is the car they will be showing, it is a concept, 

16:10.910 --> 16:13.820
I think it looks like an ordinary car that has melted. 

16:13.820 --> 16:18.850
But what I am worried about his 
they have called it the Urethra. 

16:21.360 --> 16:24.180
Are you sure? It is not actually spelt urethra, 

16:24.180 --> 16:26.880
but it looks like it is pronounced urethra.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.470
Is the urethra the bit your old chap... 

16:30.470 --> 16:34.250
Isn't it a tube connecting your 
kidney to your bladder? 

16:34.250 --> 16:37.100
Where the wee goes a long to get it 
from your kidney to your bladder? 

16:37.100 --> 16:38.180
How come you keep saying yes to everything! 

16:38.180 --> 16:41.130
How come you're such an expert? 
You look like a scaffolder!  

16:43.010 --> 16:45.700
Are you actually a wee doctor? Yes. You are? 

16:45.700 --> 16:48.230
What are you really? I am a car salesman.

16:48.230 --> 16:49.600
Car salesman. 

16:50.440 --> 16:55.430
Anyway, so if you want a melted car named 
after a tube with urine in it, 

16:55.430 --> 16:56.920
that is the car for you. 

16:56.920 --> 17:03.890
Now, Ferrari. This year's F1 car they said 
is going to be called the F150. 

17:03.890 --> 17:06.770
Then, they got a call from Ford's lawyers saying  

17:06.770 --> 17:11.410
"No, you cannot do that because we own the name 
F150 and that will cause confusion." 

17:11.410 --> 17:16.210
So let's have a look at the Ferrari. 
This is the F150, this year's F1 car, 

17:16.210 --> 17:19.060
and now let's have a look at Ford's F150.  

17:20.369 --> 17:22.839
It is easy to see how the confusion could arise 

17:22.839 --> 17:24.930
between the two if you kept them together. 

17:25.380 --> 17:27.980
What would be worse than getting pole position 
sitting on the grid and thinking, 

17:27.980 --> 17:29.750
"Right, here we go in my big F1 race, 

17:29.750 --> 17:32.000
why is there a man in a cowboy hat sitting next to me? 

17:32.000 --> 17:36.250
Oh, no, I am in a pickup truck!" 
Ferrari actually say, and I am quoting now,  

17:36.250 --> 17:39.590
it is difficult to understand Ford's 
viewpoint on this matter. 

17:39.590 --> 17:41.420
I am sort of with them. 

17:41.420 --> 17:43.430
Anyway, they have changed the name. 

17:43.430 --> 17:44.950
The Ferrari Formula One car is now called 

17:44.950 --> 17:49.140
the Ferrari F-Henry Ford is a massive peach. 

17:50.460 --> 17:53.660
Two things with the same name do not 
necessarily have to be confused. 

17:53.660 --> 17:56.760
Like Hammond can mean a massive organ, 
or it can... Oh yeah. 

17:59.780 --> 18:02.640
Does anybody here play golf? You do? 

18:02.640 --> 18:04.800
OK, I have got some news about 
personalised number plates. 

18:04.800 --> 18:06.940
I know you love that sort of thing if you play golf. 

18:08.050 --> 18:10.910
We have got the new 11 plates coming out very soon, 

18:10.910 --> 18:12.510
the numbers will be 11. 

18:12.510 --> 18:14.350
Obviously, that gives a wealth of possibilities for 

18:14.350 --> 18:16.610
writing amusing words on your number plate. 

18:17.140 --> 18:19.150
Bulldog, Holland, gallop and so on. 

18:19.150 --> 18:21.530
The DVLA, which is a big building in Wales 

18:21.530 --> 18:26.610
are now selling these numbers 
for between 3,000 and 10,000. 

18:26.610 --> 18:31.310
To be fair, it is between 3,000 and 10,000 
plus the fine you get for interfering  

18:31.310 --> 18:33.230
with the letters and numbers on your number plate. 

18:33.230 --> 18:34.580
It is true. We are the only country in the world

18:34.580 --> 18:37.750
where the government says if you move 
the letters and numbers around

18:37.750 --> 18:40.380
to make this word you can buy this from us, 

18:40.380 --> 18:42.540
and then they fine you for moving the 
letters and numbers around. 

18:42.540 --> 18:43.560
It is a bit weird, that.

18:44.020 --> 18:45.850
The interesting thing is that some of the words 

18:45.850 --> 18:48.400
have been banned for being offensive or sinister. 

18:48.400 --> 18:54.430
Words like psycho and vulgar. 
But they have allowed ballbag. 

18:56.060 --> 19:01.700
They have? No, they haven't. 
They have not allowed ballbag, 

19:01.700 --> 19:03.900
But they have allowed melons. 

19:04.680 --> 19:07.960
Isn't that sexist? It is sexist to me. 

19:07.960 --> 19:13.190
It is also not fair, because what if you 
were a wholesaler of giant hold-alls 

19:13.190 --> 19:16.630
for transporting footballs in large volumes 
to school playing fields? 

19:16.630 --> 19:18.570
You might want ballbag. They are not doing it, 

19:18.570 --> 19:23.600
but I think it is unlikely it would be 
bought by a sporting wholesaler. 

19:23.600 --> 19:26.940
In the same way that melons would 
not be bought by a greengrocer. 

19:26.940 --> 19:29.970
It would end up on Jordan's pink whore's box.

19:29.970 --> 19:33.650
What? Horse box. Oh. What did you think I said? 

19:33.650 --> 19:35.960
That is what I thought you said. 

19:37.250 --> 19:40.510
One of the things we have learned over 
the years on this show is that  

19:40.510 --> 19:46.380
if you want a small, fast saloon car, 
you have to buy a BMW M3. 

19:46.900 --> 19:51.810
You can go off and buy a fast Mercedes 
or a fast Audi if you want, 

19:51.810 --> 19:53.210
but that is like going out and buying a 

19:53.210 --> 19:56.740
Playstation war game that isn't Call of Duty. 

19:56.740 --> 20:00.870
The M3 is the best, and that is an end of it.  

20:04.320 --> 20:08.310
Now however, BMW claim they have made it even better.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.800
First of all, it is fitted with a 
devise that cuts the engine 

20:20.800 --> 20:22.440
when you stop it is set of lights, 

20:22.440 --> 20:25.420
and then start it again when you set off.  

20:26.270 --> 20:30.880
All on its own, this will solve the Global Warming.

20:38.610 --> 20:40.940
Next, it is available with a matt finish, 

20:40.940 --> 20:46.250
which is as cool as buying some skinny jeans, 
and then making an app about them.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.900
There are some drawbacks to this though, 

20:51.900 --> 20:58.480
first of all, it costs 1,755. 
I think it is a lot for a bit of paint. 

20:58.480 --> 21:03.740
Plus, you cannot take it in a car-wash or polish it, 

21:03.740 --> 21:07.220
and you must remove tree sap, 
dead insects and bird droppings 

21:07.220 --> 21:09.300
immediately or you will ruin it. 

21:10.550 --> 21:14.380
So really, you are paying 1700 quid 
for some inconvenience. 

21:16.650 --> 21:21.540
The biggest new feature is what BMW 
call the competition pack. 

21:22.230 --> 21:25.070
This will cost you 3,300. 

21:25.070 --> 21:28.850
For that you get bigger wheels and tyres, 
a lowered ride height 

21:28.850 --> 21:31.630
and one or two other software tweaks designed to 

21:31.630 --> 21:34.460
keep people pointing in vaguely the right direction. 

21:36.390 --> 21:40.700
Or if the mood takes you, 
in completely the wrong direction.

21:56.520 --> 22:02.300
I would love to say at this point that 
the competition pack has transformed this car 

22:02.300 --> 22:07.600
into a mesmerising blend of God and Uma Thurman. 

22:08.250 --> 22:09.370
But it hasn't. 

22:10.220 --> 22:16.220
Truth be told, most of the time it makes 
absolutely no difference at all. 

22:19.560 --> 22:23.120
In a straight line, it is no faster 
than the standard car. 

22:24.400 --> 22:28.570
Around the bends, 
it feels exactly the same.

22:29.990 --> 22:33.760
Except of course when you 
eventually spin, it will assume 

22:33.760 --> 22:37.290
you have arrived at a set of lights 
and cut the engine.

22:38.510 --> 22:39.980
Why have you done that! 

22:40.370 --> 22:45.170
Nobody arrives at traffic lights 
backwards in a cloud of tyre smoke! 

22:45.950 --> 22:47.840
Stupid thing! 

22:51.360 --> 22:56.410
However, with the competition pack, 
you do get one feature that you will notice. 

22:58.690 --> 23:03.940
If you push this little button here, twice, 
you engage sport mode. 

23:06.290 --> 23:08.780
It does not make any difference to the speed you go, 

23:08.780 --> 23:12.520
but it does make the car very uncomfortable. 

23:14.200 --> 23:17.760
I know, for example, this runway is very smooth.

23:17.760 --> 23:22.800
But now it feels like I am driving 
over a teenager's face. 

23:28.330 --> 23:30.780
So there we are. The competition pack. 

23:30.780 --> 23:34.610
You spend 58,000 and what you get in exchange is 

23:34.610 --> 23:41.390
a normal 55,000 M3 with a 
little button that makes it worse. 

23:47.080 --> 23:54.890
So what about this? The new Audi RS5. 
This is also 58,000, 

23:54.890 --> 23:59.240
but it does come with many bells 
and a fleet of whistles. 

24:02.210 --> 24:06.190
It has four wheel drive, 
a new mechanical centre differential 

24:06.190 --> 24:11.210
and an electronic gizmo that 
splits the torque between the rear wheels.

24:11.810 --> 24:16.140
Sounds juicy! And that is before we get to the engine. 

24:16.140 --> 24:20.820
A Lamborghini derived 4.2 litre V8. 

24:24.940 --> 24:28.820
Audi has even gone to the trouble of 
fitting the engine with a device that 

24:28.820 --> 24:33.990
fires a droplet of petrol into the hot exhaust 
every time you change gear. 

24:33.990 --> 24:35.360
So, ready?

24:39.350 --> 24:47.570
They are using the planet's resources 
to make changing gear sound nice. I like that.

24:49.130 --> 24:55.080
But can it beat the BMW? Let's find out. 

24:57.350 --> 25:02.050
He has 414 brake horsepower, I have 30 more. 

25:02.050 --> 25:05.320
I am expecting to just cruise by. 

25:05.320 --> 25:09.240
But, the Audi is heavier, and despite the 
high-tech four-wheel drive 

25:09.240 --> 25:12.020
it is nowhere near as good on the corners. 

25:14.010 --> 25:18.950
I will get him on the next one. Oh, dear. 

25:21.330 --> 25:23.720
No matter, I will get him on the braking... 

25:28.090 --> 25:29.940
I won't get him on the braking. Ooh-

25:40.070 --> 25:43.460
er! This is weird, because in all 
fast Audis I can remember, 

25:43.460 --> 25:47.000
the engine has always been way out 
in front of the front axle 

25:47.000 --> 25:49.800
sticking out like Bruce Forsyth's chin. 

25:51.780 --> 25:55.670
In this, they have moved the axle forwards. 

25:57.940 --> 26:02.370
The idea being that that would kill the 
understeer that has always plagued Audis. 

26:03.870 --> 26:07.280
Honestly, it really has not worked. Come on!

26:07.280 --> 26:08.470
Turn! 

26:12.400 --> 26:15.700
The only hope you have of getting past 
is that eventually, 

26:15.700 --> 26:21.190
the BMW driver will have to pull over 
to wipe an insect off the bonnet. 

26:27.350 --> 26:31.500
I thought the RS5 would be a modern day 
version of the original Quattro

26:31.500 --> 26:34.750
a hardcore, fire spitting monster.

26:34.750 --> 26:39.450
A machine born in the forests, 
rough, brutal and exciting. 

26:41.260 --> 26:45.070
But it is not. 
It is comfortable and relaxing and quiet. 

26:45.070 --> 26:47.100
I am sorry, but if that is what you want, 

26:47.100 --> 26:53.070
why spend 58,000 on a four-wheel drive V8?

27:00.850 --> 27:04.200
In short, neither of these cars really works. 

27:04.200 --> 27:06.780
As a result, we are back where we started. 

27:08.130 --> 27:13.340
If you want a small, fast saloon, buy a standard M3.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.940
What is there to applaud? 

27:24.540 --> 27:25.970
Let work this out, shall we. 

27:25.970 --> 27:30.300
A couple of weeks ago, 
you reviewed three cars that no one can buy. 

27:30.300 --> 27:33.410
And you have just reviewed two cars 
that no one will want to buy.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.190
I have. Thank you. 

27:35.190 --> 27:38.980
But listen. I have another problem with the 
Audi apart from the ones we have already seen.  

27:38.980 --> 27:42.060
You know Audi's sponsor, Manchester United? 

27:42.060 --> 27:46.220
How many people here support 
Manchester United? Hands up.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.250
It is a few, so they think yes we like Audis. 

27:51.250 --> 27:54.820
Now, how many people here hope that 
Manchester United, the entire team, 

27:54.820 --> 27:57.870
catch gonorrhoea and are unable to play ever again?

28:00.200 --> 28:03.520
That is the problem with a car
when its sponsors a football team.  

28:03.520 --> 28:07.180
It automatically means that the vast 
majority of people, my son included, 

28:07.180 --> 28:10.320
he hates Audis! If anyone does not support 
that football team... Exactly! 

28:10.320 --> 28:12.410
I do not want to think that divide bought an Audi, 

28:12.410 --> 28:15.010
any of my money, even a tiny bit, 
is going to Wayne Rooney. 

28:15.010 --> 28:18.140
Or Sir Ferguson. With his chewing-gum.

28:19.130 --> 28:23.760
Anyway, it is now time to find out 
how fast these cars go around our track. 

28:23.760 --> 28:27.940
That, of course, means handing them 
over to our tame racing driver. 

28:27.940 --> 28:34.110
Some say that in his wallet 
he keeps a photograph of his wallet. 

28:37.580 --> 28:43.740
And that in a recent race, 
even he was beaten by The King's Speech. 

28:44.810 --> 28:46.860
All we know is he is called The Stig. 

28:49.210 --> 28:50.710
And they're Off... 

28:50.710 --> 28:54.930
The track is moist and that should favour 
the four-wheel drive Audi. 

28:54.930 --> 29:01.260
Let's see as they come up to the first corner,  
Audi is OK there. 

29:02.250 --> 29:04.790
What about the BMW? 
No, it is getting a bit out of shape. 

29:04.790 --> 29:06.090
A bit squiggly, there.

29:06.390 --> 29:09.870
MUSIC: Tequila! It makes me happy!

29:10.500 --> 29:12.660
I have no idea why he is listening to that. 

29:13.220 --> 29:16.000
There we are, the RS5's front end washing out.  

29:16.000 --> 29:22.900
The BMW still tail happy. Ok, the Hummerhead. 
Will the Audi follow its nose like a truffle pig? 

29:23.880 --> 29:25.130
It seems to be doing all right.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.820
The tyres are squealing though, 
with that precise Germanic pain.

29:27.820 --> 29:32.150
BMW drifting like a matt painted lunatic.

29:32.150 --> 29:35.750
Tequila! It makes me happy!  

29:36.830 --> 29:39.990
Powering into the follow-through.

29:40.660 --> 29:42.380
The Audi has got its dander up now.  

29:42.380 --> 29:45.260
Through the tyres, not much in it so far. 

29:45.260 --> 29:48.390
Two corners left. Here they come now on the braking, 

29:48.390 --> 29:50.890
the RS5 looking a bit squirrelly there. 

29:51.320 --> 29:53.410
The brakes I must say are not that great on the track. 

29:53.410 --> 29:56.950
They are both slithering through Gambon 
and there we are, across the line.  

29:57.480 --> 30:06.720
So the Audi RS5 did it - 1:27:5, so that's there, 
the moist symbol. The competition pack, 

30:06.720 --> 30:09.570
even though it does not have four-wheel drive 
and the track was a bit wet, 

30:09.570 --> 30:14.230
1:26:5, so that goes there. Way faster. 

30:14.230 --> 30:18.520
Yeah but hang on, where is normal M3? 
It is there, so it is not as fast.  

30:18.520 --> 30:23.660
The M3 is the best car. It always will be and 
there is no point ever thinking otherwise. 

30:24.910 --> 30:28.830
Now, it is time to put a star 
in our reasonably priced car. 

30:28.830 --> 30:32.560
My guest tonight appears in a new film 
alongside Nicolas Cage, 

30:32.560 --> 30:36.510
one of those films where everything explodes, 
there is a car chase and it is all in 3D.

30:36.510 --> 30:40.600
But she did cause a bit of a row in the office. 

30:40.600 --> 30:45.530
You see, the producers said, you cannot have 
her on because nobody has ever heard of her. 

30:45.530 --> 30:53.300
I said, yes that is true, but she is bisexual. 
And she likes guns and muscle cars. And I won. 

30:53.300 --> 30:56.730
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Amber Heard!

31:15.650 --> 31:23.240
Carlsberg do not do guests for chat shows 
but if they did, that is pretty close to perfect. 

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
Where do we begin? 

31:24.240 --> 31:27.100
I hear that is a good sign. It is a good sign. 

31:27.100 --> 31:30.400
I am trying to think of anybody else 
I would rather be sitting and talking to now...

31:31.200 --> 31:32.240
No, can't think of anybody.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.920
The films you have been previously haven't 
really allow you to indulge 

31:36.920 --> 31:40.780
this passion for guns and muscle cars, I guess. 

31:40.780 --> 31:43.650
Really, what was that, 
the Pineapple Express, Zombie Land..

31:43.650 --> 31:47.600
And then what was that one where you're 
pretty much naked throughout? The Informers.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.720
The Informers, I've watched it a lot.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.940
I think that's why people watch it at all, to be honest. 

31:53.940 --> 31:55.950
I am watching it now.  

31:57.290 --> 31:58.900
Come back to me! 

31:59.370 --> 32:04.980
But the new movie, the new movie 
Drive Angie in 3-D, Nicolas Cage, 

32:04.980 --> 32:07.600
this is written with you in mind. 

32:07.600 --> 32:11.750
This movie is so BLEEP cool. It is. 

32:14.020 --> 32:20.460
It's loud guns, fast cars and short shorts on me, 
not Nicolas Cage. 

32:21.540 --> 32:24.550
We have actually got a clip of the film. 
We will show that to you now. 

32:24.550 --> 32:26.010
Let's look at that.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.180
Tell them I'm coming. You're too late.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.930
Hell already is walking the earth.  

32:33.930 --> 32:38.190
He broke out of hell to make things right. 

32:38.190 --> 32:41.930
Now he's got one last shot at redemption.

32:47.670 --> 32:50.030
Just so you know I don't pick up hitch-hikers. 

32:50.030 --> 32:51.090
I didn't have my thumb out.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.260
Between now and then I'mma mess you up.

33:09.510 --> 33:12.040
That's got all the things we need. Yeah. 

33:16.130 --> 33:18.800
I drove the BLEEP out of that car. 

33:18.800 --> 33:24.220
I did almost all my own stunts and jumping 
out of the car on to the other car I did. 

33:24.220 --> 33:26.350
You did do that? Yeah. That was me. 

33:26.350 --> 33:29.330
Presumably you could get that badly wrong 
and go through the windscreen? 

33:29.330 --> 33:30.670
We have to do it over and over again. 

33:30.670 --> 33:34.900
Doing it once is no problem but doing it ten times -

33:34.900 --> 33:38.720
every day I came home with bruises and scrapes. 

33:38.720 --> 33:41.440
That must take forever. It does take a long time. 

33:41.440 --> 33:44.420
So muscle cars, where does this love come from? 

33:44.420 --> 33:48.480
I am from Texas and I think that had 
something to do with it.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.210
It helps being from the south, 
people are obsessed with their cars there. 

33:52.210 --> 33:56.780
Have you got one? 
Yes, I drive a 68 Mustang in LA. That's my car.

34:00.680 --> 34:05.730
You have just grown a third leg. He has. 

34:10.380 --> 34:12.000
Has it always been muscle cars or did you 

34:12.000 --> 34:14.389
go through a period of rabbit or whatever?

34:14.389 --> 34:16.449
I have had everything... 

34:16.449 --> 34:18.570
It's a Golf, stupid idiot! 

34:20.520 --> 34:24.449
Has it always been a love of old American big V8s?  

34:24.449 --> 34:29.780
I have had a 67 Mercedes, a 62 Checker. 
The cab? Yes. 

34:29.780 --> 34:33.310
The Mustang is that in Los Angeles? 
Yes, that's my baby. 

34:33.310 --> 34:38.659
What colour is it? It was cherry red 
until the last time it got stolen. 

34:38.659 --> 34:39.780
It gets stolen a lot.

34:39.780 --> 34:40.949
Why does it get stolen so much, 

34:40.949 --> 34:44.909
I would have thought it was easy to find 
someone driving a 68 Mustang? 

34:44.909 --> 34:48.690
Apparently burglars or 
whatever you call them - car thieves. 

34:48.690 --> 34:50.940
Bustards is another one. 

34:52.449 --> 34:54.179
I like how you say it. 

34:54.179 --> 34:58.050
Anyway, apparently it's easy to 
find for all sorts of people. 

34:58.050 --> 35:04.760
Most people that talk here about car who is 
live in California have bought a Toyota... Prius. 

35:04.760 --> 35:06.390
Why haven't you gone down that route? 

35:06.390 --> 35:10.880
I don't blame people for buying them, 
that's great, smart. 

35:10.880 --> 35:13.680
You have a Prius? I DO NOT have a Prius.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.780
I loath them with an unbridled passion! 

35:18.320 --> 35:23.370
When people say I have a Prius because I care, 
I care about the environment, 

35:23.370 --> 35:25.290
shirts made from leaves. 

35:26.090 --> 35:29.700
My shirt is made from leaves. 
Is it? No, no. It's just -

35:32.580 --> 35:36.980
I mean the Nickell for the batteries 
in that thing is mined in Canada 

35:36.980 --> 35:40.740
and it's taken to Norway and go to Japan. 

35:40.740 --> 35:44.530
It's done two and a half million miles 
before you buy it in California. 

35:44.530 --> 35:46.980
I just ram into them in your Mustang if I was you.  

35:46.980 --> 35:49.600
I have done that in a Checker.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.220
hit a Prius? 
I rammed into a couple of them, not just one. 

35:56.590 --> 35:59.490
I would have just laughed. 

36:01.460 --> 36:03.900
We have done cars now. We will move on to guns. 

36:03.900 --> 36:06.970
You are obviously from Texas, 
it's part of the culture there, I guess. 

36:06.970 --> 36:08.380
You grew up with them. 

36:08.380 --> 36:12.810
I grew up around guns, around gun owners and users.

36:12.810 --> 36:16.860
My dad at any given point had several, 
it's the culture. 

36:16.860 --> 36:21.590
I have a gun myself. What sort? A 357 Magnum.  

36:23.940 --> 36:25.170
I have gone again. 

36:26.740 --> 36:30.060
Have you ever fired a machine gun? 
I have. I have actually. 

36:32.340 --> 36:36.240
A automatic weapon, I set fire to 
Arizona once with one of those, 

36:36.240 --> 36:42.200
you are just firing away, it's brilliant. 
and oh God, the desert is on fire.  

36:42.200 --> 36:45.020
Great fun. Sounds like you know how to party... 

36:49.320 --> 36:53.480
On that bombshell, it's time to end. 
Thank you for watching, good night.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.960
Obviously, you are from Texas. 
Austin, I believe. Yeah. 

36:59.960 --> 37:03.530
I went there once and went to a bar 
called the Broken Spoke. 

37:03.530 --> 37:08.020
Have you been there? I used to square dance.  

37:08.020 --> 37:10.130
You didn't do line dancing? Oh, yeah. 

37:10.130 --> 37:12.920
I am from Texas after all. 

37:12.920 --> 37:14.620
The guy that ran it, I can remember watching, 

37:14.620 --> 37:19.620
we don't have none of that fancy water. 

37:19.620 --> 37:21.070
I think that was my dad. 

37:22.710 --> 37:24.480
So, when you went back to Texas, 

37:24.480 --> 37:26.970
which is a deeply conservative neck of the woods.  

37:26.970 --> 37:27.880
Bible belt. 

37:27.880 --> 37:30.130
And said this is my girlfriend, 

37:31.390 --> 37:35.410
how did it go down? I think that, 
you know, I have always been - 

37:35.410 --> 37:37.660
I used to go to Catholic school and got in trouble 

37:37.660 --> 37:42.110
for the books I read, written by George Orwell... 

37:42.110 --> 37:44.190
You read a George Orwell book in Texas? 

37:44.760 --> 37:47.700
I found myself going against the grain and 

37:47.700 --> 37:52.820
I have had to confront preconceived notions 

37:52.820 --> 37:55.250
for what a girl like me should be like

37:55.250 --> 37:58.070
my whole life and I have always been 
myself and done my own thing.

37:58.070 --> 38:01.430
I am surprised you weren't put in an 
electric chair for reading George Orwell? 

38:01.430 --> 38:02.870
Because he is a communist. 

38:02.870 --> 38:04.360
I carry a gun. 

38:06.950 --> 38:10.120
You came here to do your lap wearing those shoes. 

38:10.120 --> 38:11.710
These are my driving shoes.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.260
Did you do a lap in those? They wouldn't let me. 

38:15.260 --> 38:18.210
They made me wear a helmet too, can you believe that?

38:18.210 --> 38:21.090
Made you what? Wear a helmet, with this hair.  

38:22.870 --> 38:26.730
fluffed up nicely. Thank you. I have a good fluffer.

38:31.740 --> 38:36.420
Stig, OK, he was very - 
please don't take this the wrong one, 

38:36.420 --> 38:40.380
he is a very unusual person 
he was very disappointed when you arrived

38:40.380 --> 38:44.240
because he was expecting Thora Hird, 
not Amber. I don't know... 

38:48.680 --> 38:51.040
He has a complete crush on her. He loves her.  

38:52.100 --> 38:54.590
How did you manage to get on 
with our Cee-apostrophe-d? 

38:54.590 --> 38:56.030
It did OK on the track. 

38:56.030 --> 38:59.330
Don't know if it would be my everyday car, 
but it did OK on the track. 

38:59.330 --> 39:03.190
Shall we find out. 
Who would like to see Amber's lap?

39:04.490 --> 39:05.730
Here we go.  

39:09.380 --> 39:11.930
There's no wheel spin. I was trying.

39:14.380 --> 39:19.230
What are you wearing on your hands? 
Gloves. What, driving gloves? 

39:20.100 --> 39:23.130
Wow, that's how go through there! 

39:24.380 --> 39:26.060
Not all the road, but not bad. 

39:26.060 --> 39:28.360
Look at those gloves! 

39:30.200 --> 39:32.720
Are you actually a murderer, part time? Yes! 

39:32.720 --> 39:35.100
They look like strangler's gloves, to me.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.560
This feels very illegal. 
Like it should be illegal. 

39:38.560 --> 39:41.380
No no no, you can drive as fast as 
you like in Britain, you're OK. 

39:41.380 --> 39:43.410
There are yellow boxes to record it for you.  

39:43.410 --> 39:45.050
They send you a note of praise. 

39:46.400 --> 39:48.530
That's not bad, a bit of understeer,
not your fault. 

39:50.140 --> 39:51.680
This does not have quite the same intensity 

39:51.680 --> 39:54.450
when you watch it back. No, you're right.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.410
Open your eyes! Keep your eyes open,  

39:59.410 --> 40:01.260
you're not going in that corner.

40:01.260 --> 40:02.660
That looks pretty quick, actually.  

40:02.660 --> 40:07.130
BLEEP. Have a look in here, cut it.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.640
That is quite uncomfortable when you do that. 

40:09.640 --> 40:11.140
Right, coming up, second to last corner. 

40:11.140 --> 40:12.450
This is where most people get it wrong. 

40:13.510 --> 40:14.730
I think you're on the wrong side of the road. 

40:14.730 --> 40:20.180
There we are, in to Gambon, where Tom Cruise 
damn nearly rolled over. 

40:20.180 --> 40:22.670
And there we are, across the line! 

40:31.950 --> 40:35.100
Where do you reckon you have come? I have no idea. 

40:35.100 --> 40:38.340
Well, Tom Cruise is 1:44:2. That show-off! 

40:38.340 --> 40:39.720
It was a bit show-offy. 

40:39.720 --> 40:42.860
Cameron Diaz, who you probably also know, 
is 1:45:2.

40:42.860 --> 40:51.680
really? Anyway, you did it in one minute, 50.3. 

40:52.560 --> 40:55.680
Which is the slowest dry lap we have ever had! 

40:55.680 --> 40:57.500
Oh no! 

40:59.020 --> 41:00.770
It is a record of sorts! 

41:05.620 --> 41:09.500
The most important thing is that we now 
know you are a beautiful,

41:09.500 --> 41:15.350
well read and intelligent, well travelled, 
bisexual gun and muscle car enthusiast. 

41:15.350 --> 41:20.290
Ladies and gentlemen, you really have struck 
lucky this week, Amber Heard!

41:23.050 --> 41:24.980
Thank you.

41:36.180 --> 41:40.240
Right. Now. This evening we solved 
Britain's financial crisis 

41:40.240 --> 41:43.460
by making a combine harvester into a snow plough. 

41:43.460 --> 41:47.600
Earlier on in Norway, we used it to 
make a runway on a frozen lake. 

41:47.600 --> 41:50.680
If we are honest, 
things did not go entirely to plan.  

41:51.550 --> 41:55.340
No. The aeroplane that we landed 
sort of crashed a bit, 

41:55.340 --> 41:58.620
but never mind that.  
We pick up the action later that same evening, 

41:58.620 --> 42:02.290
heading for a nearby town, 
where Jeremy was very keen 

42:02.290 --> 42:05.360
to try out a de-icing he fitted.  

42:12.040 --> 42:17.820
I am the God of hellfire and I bring you fire! Yes!  

42:20.590 --> 42:24.210
"As we entered the town, 
we all went to action stations. 

42:24.210 --> 42:25.930
I turning the Bovril on. 

42:31.240 --> 42:33.000
Hammond! You have got good grit! 

42:34.120 --> 42:37.770
"Unfortunately, communications were a bit ropey".

42:40.630 --> 42:42.910
Stop! Stop we've hit a building!  

42:42.910 --> 42:45.360
Fans are on, going forward.

42:45.360 --> 42:50.600
stop! Stop Stop Stop! James, James stop! 

42:50.600 --> 42:55.420
No, do not stop. Drive! Drive! 
Just drive away, James.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.040
He did it! He did it!  

42:57.040 --> 42:58.770
"Annoyingly, it was a dead end, 

42:58.770 --> 43:01.330
so James had to do a three-point turn,  

43:01.330 --> 43:04.430
which he is not that good at in a normal car". 

43:07.720 --> 43:09.680
Stop stop stop! 

43:10.320 --> 43:15.000
"If I am honest, Jeremy and I were not much help". 

43:15.000 --> 43:19.950
Hard left, hard left. Up to the right. 

43:19.950 --> 43:22.310
Not now, wait until the top of the slope! 
Not now!  

43:24.970 --> 43:29.200
Maybe straighten up now. I have also had a wee.  

43:29.200 --> 43:33.220
Can you give me sort of clear instructions 
rather than a load of hysteria? 

43:33.220 --> 43:35.160
I have no idea what is going on.

43:36.870 --> 43:39.870
"After much palaver, we finally broke free". 

43:41.020 --> 43:44.560
We have damaged it quite badly at the back. 
And that house. 

43:44.560 --> 43:49.440
But it is OK, because we have gritted 
at least 30 ft of road.  

43:55.230 --> 43:58.420
"On the High Street, we had yet more success".  

44:03.910 --> 44:07.760
I am in a Ford Sierra Cosworth 
seat with a flamethrower. 

44:09.840 --> 44:11.960
It is not possible to be happier than that. 

44:12.430 --> 44:14.590
Here we go, burning the bank! 

44:14.590 --> 44:18.310
We are gritting, we are flame throwing, 

44:18.310 --> 44:22.160
we have done a bit of ploughing, it is all marvellous. 

44:24.360 --> 44:27.580
We are International Rescue. We are Thunderbirds!  

44:27.580 --> 44:31.570
Cruising through Norway, 
looking for people who need our services.  

44:32.480 --> 44:35.770
I have to do the three-point turn now chaps, 
we are at the end. 

44:36.560 --> 44:38.080
I will provide the rear lighting. 

44:39.280 --> 44:41.920
It is like a reversing light, this. kind of. 

44:43.620 --> 44:48.540
When Jeremy fires his flame-thrower, 
I can see a little bit in that mirror. 

44:48.540 --> 44:52.010
Keeps going backwards James. 

44:52.010 --> 44:54.800
Oh look! No, no!  

44:54.800 --> 44:56.540
Look what I have done! What have you done! 

44:57.450 --> 44:59.490
Go Go Go!  

44:59.490 --> 45:02.610
"Again, There was only one thing to do." 

45:02.610 --> 45:07.330
Are we running away? 
I have no idea what is happening.

45:09.500 --> 45:12.420
"After much driving around and doing things, 

45:12.420 --> 45:15.300
we were hungry, and the tank was empty". 

45:16.220 --> 45:19.120
Dive in here for fuel and a bag of crisps 
and then we will carry on. 

45:23.420 --> 45:26.060
Does he realise how much the back swings out!? 

45:27.220 --> 45:30.570
I am going to clear this thing of snow for them,

45:30.570 --> 45:31.730
that will make them happy. 

45:31.730 --> 45:32.830
Watch this! 

45:35.400 --> 45:36.430
Cock! 

45:40.030 --> 45:41.000
Why have we stopped?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.430
I was trying to clear that thing of snow 
but it has got a car in it. 

45:45.620 --> 45:48.640
-é·éæ²¡å­¦æï¼åé·äººäºO(â©_â©)O-
I was going to be helpful and clear that, 
there was a car in it. 

45:48.640 --> 45:51.570
A car? The whole thing was covered in snow. 
I thought it was a pile of snow.

45:51.570 --> 45:55.290
It is not covered in snow! 
Not any more, you moron! It was! 

45:55.290 --> 45:57.620
Why did you ram a car? He rammed into a car! 

45:57.620 --> 45:59.770
I was trying to be helpful!

45:59.770 --> 46:01.620
"There was only one thing to do".  

46:01.620 --> 46:04.140
Go, go. Run away, run away. 

46:07.880 --> 46:11.660
"So far then, we had crashed a plane, 
ruined a car, burned a sign 

46:11.660 --> 46:15.900
and smashed a house. Then, things got worse".

46:19.820 --> 46:25.260
Hang on, my flame-thrower is jammed! 
The flame-thrower is jammed! 

46:26.630 --> 46:27.830
So what are you doing? 

46:29.820 --> 46:33.040
I can see a yellow mist in the mirror.

46:36.190 --> 46:37.380
There is a man on fire! 

46:37.970 --> 46:40.320
James, Jeremy has set fire to a skier. Run away.

46:42.690 --> 46:45.190
I think that if we do get reported to the police, 

46:45.190 --> 46:48.030
it will not take them very long to find us.

46:48.920 --> 46:52.410
"Still, as we were not actually 
being stoned by an angry mob, 

46:52.410 --> 46:55.850
we went to bed that night feeling quite cheerful. 

46:57.660 --> 47:00.760
However, the next morning, there was bad news.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.790
What does it actually say? Is it upbeat? 

47:10.790 --> 47:13.110
I do not think it is going to be upbeat, is it? 

47:14.020 --> 47:18.160
HE ATTEMPTS TO READ THE NORWEGIAN ARTICLE OUTLOUD.

47:18.160 --> 47:21.370
"An incredibly small man knocked my house"?... 

47:21.370 --> 47:23.070
Good morning! 

47:23.630 --> 47:24.670
We are in the paper.  

47:26.100 --> 47:28.610
It says what a good service we provided? 

47:28.610 --> 47:30.140
We cleared the snow and... No. 

47:30.140 --> 47:34.260
"A man who looked like a dog 
crashed into one of my trees", 

47:34.260 --> 47:36.650
I do not think it is a good idea to stay here any more. 

47:36.650 --> 47:38.270
Can I make a suggestion? Yes. 

47:38.270 --> 47:40.550
Since this is a sort of prototype and we are testing it, 

47:40.550 --> 47:42.820
why don't we go and test it on a country road 

47:42.820 --> 47:46.210
where there is just snow? No people.

47:46.210 --> 47:48.880
No people or cars or buildings 
or trees or benches, 

47:48.880 --> 47:50.710
let's just try and clear some snow.  

47:52.420 --> 47:56.080
"This was a good idea. 
So we fired up the dominator and 

47:56.080 --> 48:01.050
headed for a road so remote, even the Nors
had abandoned it to the weather. 

48:05.390 --> 48:09.670
A mountain pass called 
'the road of terror', probably".  

48:13.430 --> 48:17.250
If we can open this one road...

48:18.560 --> 48:22.400
have proven the work of 
this machine, internationally. 

48:22.400 --> 48:24.630
And I think we will be forgiven for all the small things 

48:24.630 --> 48:25.500
we have done wrong.

48:25.500 --> 48:29.030
The man on fire, houses, the car and the sign.

48:31.990 --> 48:36.300
"Eventually, we arrived at the gates of a frozen hell".

48:37.550 --> 48:39.760
One of a problems we found yesterday was that 

48:39.760 --> 48:41.990
you tend to get snow sticking to the plough,  

48:41.990 --> 48:44.250
building up and it does not work as well. 

48:44.250 --> 48:48.080
So, an idea that I had is 
to cover the plough itself 

48:48.080 --> 48:50.470
in a mixture of oil and diesel. 

48:50.470 --> 48:52.820
I am now doing it, because it is my idea.

48:52.820 --> 48:54.200
He is claiming it is his idea. 

48:55.870 --> 48:59.600
I happen to know he was talking to a 
snowplough driver in the bar last night. 

49:00.940 --> 49:02.200
Nothing is going to stick to that.  

49:02.920 --> 49:06.050
"With the preparations done, we set off ". 

49:11.940 --> 49:13.520
Come on, dominator!  

49:15.060 --> 49:19.410
"Our destination was a desolate 
hamlet 10 kilometres away". 

49:21.590 --> 49:23.060
Look at that. 

49:24.530 --> 49:28.780
Boldly ploughing where no Norwegian 
has ploughed so far this winter. 

49:33.760 --> 49:36.760
This is a 1980s machine, so that is a cassette player. 

49:38.120 --> 49:41.010
Do you think James is getting lonely downthere? 
He will love it. 

49:41.010 --> 49:46.110
And I bet 10 million he is fantasising 
about a being a lone skipper 

49:46.110 --> 49:50.350
of some weather battered trawler 
out in the North Sea. 

49:50.350 --> 49:55.770
A lone skipper, but with one quite 
attractive man in the galley.  

50:04.120 --> 50:07.360
"With the oiled plough siding 
nicely through the snow,

50:07.360 --> 50:09.730
Jeremy and I swung into action."  

50:13.930 --> 50:16.110
Burn Baby Burn! 

50:25.100 --> 50:27.060
The gritting is going well, Hammond. 

50:43.400 --> 50:44.730
I have lost my wedding ring! 

50:44.730 --> 50:47.350
What? I have lost my wedding ring!

50:48.550 --> 50:50.460
Has it gone in the thing? It must have done. 

50:53.210 --> 50:55.120
That is a tricky one to explain.  

50:56.710 --> 51:00.890
"Soon though, we had bigger things to 
worry about than Hammond's ring". 

51:00.890 --> 51:01.680
Oh, hang on. 

51:05.070 --> 51:07.580
What was that? I nearly went through the windscreen. 

51:08.380 --> 51:11.610
"But a snowy hillock was no match 
for the dominator". 

51:12.420 --> 51:13.810
Take this, snow.  

51:15.150 --> 51:17.230
Charge! 

51:21.670 --> 51:22.680
We're through!

51:26.050 --> 51:29.860
"However, while the battering ram was OK 
in this lonely place, 

51:33.720 --> 51:36.400
the rear wheel steering was a nightmare".

51:37.760 --> 51:41.540
Oh no, no no no! A tank slapper. 

51:45.290 --> 51:47.290
Don't do it! It has got a mind of its own!

51:48.590 --> 51:51.890
"On the hills, we had a serious power shortage". 

51:53.360 --> 51:57.400
James, is that full-speed? Yes it is. 

52:05.520 --> 52:06.280
We are stuck.  

52:07.300 --> 52:09.310
If you think about it, a combine harvester was designed 

52:09.310 --> 52:13.160
to never work in the snow, 
or the rain, or on a hill. 

52:13.160 --> 52:15.790
It is always flat ground 
on lovely summer's evenings. 

52:16.340 --> 52:18.210
It is out of its comfort zone here.  

52:19.030 --> 52:21.710
"Which meant that sadly, so was I".

52:27.080 --> 52:30.250
He will want the Victoria Cross now, 
for using a shovel. 

52:30.250 --> 52:31.320
He will. 

52:33.970 --> 52:36.260
Will I just raise the plough 
and take his head off? Yes. 

52:36.260 --> 52:38.570
Oh, for god's sake!

52:40.450 --> 52:43.510
"Each kilometre was now a growing challenge. 

52:47.580 --> 52:51.280
My ingenious snow measuring tactic 
did not go brilliantly". 

52:57.600 --> 53:00.750
"But the Top Gear snowbine kept on moving". 

53:01.320 --> 53:02.640
Go! Full power! 

53:09.050 --> 53:11.260
Look at us carving a path. Look, that is ours.

53:12.820 --> 53:16.560
This road is open and will remain 
so until it snows again! 

53:16.560 --> 53:20.300
Tonight, probably. Or tomorrow. 

53:21.600 --> 53:27.540
'Warning - the Top Gear Snowbine 
Harvester is approaching!'  

53:28.840 --> 53:30.570
This is really annoying. 
For the first time in my life 

53:30.570 --> 53:34.740
I have one of these Tannoy things and 
there is absolutely nobody to talk to.  

53:40.070 --> 53:42.020
James, there is one kilometre to go! 

53:42.020 --> 53:45.510
One more kilometre and this road is open. 

53:46.460 --> 53:49.060
Who fancies a celebratory Bovril, when we get there? 

53:50.420 --> 53:53.520
Unless Bovril is a code word for something dirty, 
I do not want to do that. 

53:54.870 --> 53:57.130
Hang on, getting a bit of a tank slapper. 

53:57.130 --> 53:58.840
It is wandering off! 

54:00.800 --> 54:02.130
Oh no! 

54:08.640 --> 54:09.490
BLEEP. 

54:10.420 --> 54:14.510
"This time, we had come off the road 
and into a massive snowdrift". 

54:19.730 --> 54:22.040
Jesus wept. That is a lot of snow. 

54:22.920 --> 54:26.850
The snow out here, that we are in, is incredibly deep. 

54:26.850 --> 54:28.840
Yes, that is what I feared.  

54:28.840 --> 54:31.190
It felt quite deep as it went off the edge. 

54:32.240 --> 54:35.730
You can see the extent of the problem is quite big. 

54:35.730 --> 54:41.270
A whole machine is... BLEEP.  

54:42.160 --> 54:46.050
"So, one wheel was stuck and 
one was spinning uselessly". 

54:46.520 --> 54:47.600
Full power! 

54:54.090 --> 54:54.880
It is not going to do it.

54:57.520 --> 55:01.880
"Spurred on by the previous day's failures, 
we dug furiously". 

55:06.760 --> 55:09.690
Just for once, I want to do something properly. 

55:10.710 --> 55:15.230
I want to clear this road and do it. 
No cocking about. 

55:22.820 --> 55:26.300
This is coming out. Do not rock it back. Now forwards! 

55:28.290 --> 55:29.970
That feels abusive. 

55:32.310 --> 55:34.960
I am wearing the clutch out, 
hang on, it is starting to smell. 

55:35.560 --> 55:37.300
Do not stop, James!  

55:37.300 --> 55:39.940
"With darkness falling and the temperature dropping, 

55:39.940 --> 55:42.610
this was no time for mechanical sympathy". 

55:43.090 --> 55:44.850
Come on, James. We can do this.  

55:51.620 --> 55:53.980
Nearly! Power! 

56:00.550 --> 56:04.400
Yes, come on! Come on! 

56:08.550 --> 56:12.500
Yes! Yes! Yes! That's it, climb aboard.  

56:15.170 --> 56:17.760
"The dominator surged forwards.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.350
Soon, our destination hoved into view. 

56:28.870 --> 56:33.580
We are so nearly there. Look at that! 

56:37.240 --> 56:42.810
That is a blaze of glory! 
Blaze of glory, grit and Bovril.

56:45.330 --> 56:50.190
Ladies and gentlemen the Top Gear 
snowbine harvester has arrived.

56:52.020 --> 56:53.360
"And so, there we are. 

56:53.360 --> 56:56.470
For once in our wretched lives on this programme, 

56:56.470 --> 56:59.970
we had actually done what we set out to do". 

57:01.470 --> 57:05.330
You know what? What? 
We have been ambitious and brilliant, 

57:05.330 --> 57:07.880
and it is all thanks to the dominator. 
Successful.  

57:08.320 --> 57:10.080
Gentleman, it has been a 
pleasure ploughing with you. 

57:10.080 --> 57:11.590
It has been a joy and an honour. 

57:12.280 --> 57:13.860
That was the right road, wasn't it?

57:19.700 --> 57:22.560
We did something! We were actually good! 

57:22.560 --> 57:26.180
I can hardly believe it 
but it is true, that's weird.

57:28.960 --> 57:33.050
Some conclusions we can draw from 
our outstanding success, there. 

57:33.050 --> 57:36.900
Britain has 3700 snow ploughs and gritters, 

57:36.900 --> 57:40.980
and spends 160 million per year clearing snow. 

57:40.980 --> 57:45.180
Obviously, that is not enough because 
every time there is a light flurry, 

57:45.180 --> 57:47.320
everything shuts down and closes. 

57:47.320 --> 57:49.620
That is why our idea makes so much sense because 

57:49.620 --> 57:53.390
there are 15,000 combine harvesters in Britain. 

57:53.390 --> 57:56.380
All it takes to convert them 
into snowploughs is a spanner 

57:56.380 --> 57:57.880
and a couple of burly men. 

57:58.730 --> 58:00.630
Well, the gritter bit was a bit more complicated. 

58:00.630 --> 58:02.830
And the flame-thrower. 
I am not sure you need that.

58:02.830 --> 58:05.720
you do. It is brilliant. 
It is a good reversing light. 

58:05.720 --> 58:08.720
You set fire to a man. No, I did not! 

58:08.720 --> 58:12.960
He spontaneously combusted 
as we were driving by. 

58:12.960 --> 58:15.480
It was incredible. 
I have never seen anything like it.

58:15.480 --> 58:19.190
Anyway, the important thing is that 
our dominator was an old machine.

58:19.190 --> 58:22.100
If we used one of the more modern 
ones with more power, 

58:22.100 --> 58:25.580
especially if it had four-wheel drive, 
it would be brilliant. 

58:25.580 --> 58:26.410
It would. 

58:26.410 --> 58:30.150
There we are, we have succeed 
where the Bank of England has failed.

58:30.150 --> 58:33.220
We have solved the country's financial crisis.

58:33.220 --> 58:35.260
And I think we will get marquises now.

58:35.260 --> 58:36.410
I suspect so, yes.

58:36.410 --> 58:39.000
So on that bombshell, it's time to end.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.480
Thank you very much for watching, good night.
