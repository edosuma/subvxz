WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:15.473 --> 00:17.976
- And so, then...
- No way!

00:20.562 --> 00:24.315
Mary! I heard you repaid
your 50 million yen debt

00:24.399 --> 00:26.067
and aren't Mittens anymore!

00:26.151 --> 00:27.777
Way to go, Mary!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.487
Really!

00:33.116 --> 00:37.245
Well, we're... sorry about how we acted.

00:45.086 --> 00:49.048
Aw, you know it doesn't bother me.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.134
We're friends, right?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.761
That's right.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.554
Aw, how silly of me.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.645
Let's get some cake again sometime.

01:06.691 --> 01:10.945
Not really. The school rules say
you have to be mean to house pets.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.115
- That's just how it works.
- Really?

01:14.199 --> 01:17.035
House pets almost never go back
to being human.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.748
They thought it was safe to bully me.
Now, they're freaking out.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.417
They're all a bunch of idiots.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.253
Anyway, that aside...

01:28.338 --> 01:32.550
I'm never forgiving the student council
for what they did to me.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.304
Anyway, about Yumeko...

01:36.387 --> 01:37.639
Did you know?

01:37.722 --> 01:41.768
She won all that money
at the Debt Settlement Party

01:41.851 --> 01:43.436
and hasn't paid it back.

01:44.938 --> 01:49.859
She had a chance to lessen her debts
at the party, and she's wasting it.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.737
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

01:53.780 --> 01:59.869
She doesn't want to give up being Mittens.
Or maybe she wants the benefits.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.205
Being Mittens has benefits?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.875
That's right. Official matches.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.168
Don't tell me...

02:07.252 --> 02:10.421
Yumeko wants to challenge
the student council to a match?

02:10.505 --> 02:13.925
Did Yumeko tell you anything?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.552
What do you mean?

02:16.010 --> 02:18.388
There's tons of other ways to gamble.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.849
So, why an official match?

02:20.932 --> 02:23.268
She didn't say anything.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.436
What?

02:25.520 --> 02:29.649
She did say she wanted to gamble
with the student council president.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.610
Ryota. Mary.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.529
Good morning.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.573
Good morning, Yumeko.

02:38.616 --> 02:44.539
Mary, I've been thinking, and it's not
right for me to take that money I earned

02:44.622 --> 02:46.249
at the Debt Settlement Party.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.667
It's fine.

02:47.750 --> 02:51.629
I used ten million of it
to pay back my debts.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.507
But we won it by working together.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.511
I don't want to owe you anything.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.097
Take the hint!

03:02.181 --> 03:05.935
Okay. Then I'll take you up on that offer.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.521
Just take it.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.836
You're not rescinding
Yumeko Jabami's life plan?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.171
Yes, that's the president's wish.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.923
What's going on here?

04:59.007 --> 05:02.844
She got 260 million yen in the party.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.679
We're just ignoring that?

05:04.762 --> 05:05.722
I couldn't say.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.599
I can't say what's on her mind.

05:09.058 --> 05:13.271
But when I looked into Yumeko Jabami
at her request,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.566
I found that she has considerable
reserves of funds.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.483
What?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.736
Yumeko Jabami lives alone.

05:20.153 --> 05:24.073
Her parents have passed away. Her only
immediate relative is an older sister.

05:24.782 --> 05:29.662
She's spent a long time in the special
ward of a university hospital,

05:29.746 --> 05:32.790
which is paid for by Yumeko.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.419
That can only be explained
by a large bank account.

05:38.963 --> 05:43.134
So, she's not paying back debts
she could pay?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.720
What is she thinking?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.431
What else?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.224
The official match.

05:50.308 --> 05:55.063
Yumeko says she wants to gamble
with the president. That scared me.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.150
What's wrong, Midari?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.819
Yumeko, having an official match
with the president?

06:03.029 --> 06:06.157
That's bad! The president will kill her.

06:06.240 --> 06:11.287
No!

06:11.370 --> 06:13.873
- She belongs to me!
- Hey! Ikishima!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.085
What's her problem?

06:19.003 --> 06:21.964
Be careful, Midari.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.718
CLASSICS B

06:28.387 --> 06:30.681
Class is finally over, huh?

06:30.765 --> 06:34.519
I was so eager for this to begin
that I wasn't paying attention. Let's go.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.397
Um... do you mean the official match?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.774
Yes, of course.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.443
Shouldn't you take more time to get ready?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.530
My heart's been ready a long time.
Don't worry.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.657
No, that's not what I mean.

06:48.866 --> 06:52.120
The student council president
beat her once.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.248
She's going to try again?
What's making Yumeko do this?

06:57.625 --> 07:01.546
Fine. I think we just have to go
to the student council room.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.465
- I'll take you there.
- Thanks.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.097
An official match
with the student council president, huh?

07:11.806 --> 07:14.517
Well, 200 million isn't a lot of money.

07:14.600 --> 07:19.730
- She can do what she wants with it.
- Mary, let's go home together.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.733
- What do you want to do?
- What do I do?

07:22.817 --> 07:26.946
This is the student council's system.
I'm winning and losing inside that system.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.035
When I think about
how they're in control of me,

07:33.119 --> 07:35.913
blood rushes to my head
and I want to vomit.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.667
Am I okay with this?

07:51.512 --> 07:55.766
Mary Saotome,
how about you join me for a cup of tea?

07:56.517 --> 07:57.602
Just the two of us.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.104
THE INVITING GIRL

08:00.188 --> 08:03.065
I found you, Yumeko!

08:03.149 --> 08:05.693
I remember you.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.321
Thank you so much for your help.

08:09.030 --> 08:15.286
Yumeko, I heard you haven't paid
back the 310 million you owe.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.997
As beautification officer,
I can't ignore that.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.376
What are you doing?

08:22.460 --> 08:27.298
I reform the garbage in the school,
beautifying it into its proper form.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.218
That's my job.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.595
The Beautification Committee
is one of the organizations

08:32.678 --> 08:34.305
- with the power to arrest.
- Wait--

08:34.889 --> 08:36.641
- Take her.
- Okay!

08:37.225 --> 08:41.687
I have lots of things to ask her,
lots of things.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.648
Arrest? You can't just--

08:43.731 --> 08:45.942
Take him while you're at it.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.026
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.333
Don't make that face, Yumeko.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.376
Here.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.879
What do you want? I have plans.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.464
Plans, huh?

09:08.923 --> 09:09.924
I know.

09:10.508 --> 09:15.972
Do you think a delinquent like you
will be allowed to meet the president?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.766
And an official match
is out of the question.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.851
If you insist...

09:20.935 --> 09:24.605
If you absolutely insist
on challenging her,

09:24.689 --> 09:28.192
gamble with me first, Yumeko.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.819
Oh, you want to gamble.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.155
Well, why didn't you say so?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.824
So, what are we doing?

09:36.492 --> 09:39.704
I believed you'd say that.

09:40.162 --> 09:44.375
I can tell. You and I are the same.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.794
Perverts who get off on the thrill!

09:46.877 --> 09:50.131
Oh, no, a pervert? How lewd.

09:52.925 --> 09:59.807
Now, this place is an interrogation room,
created to reform the school's garbage.

09:59.890 --> 10:06.689
It's split into an interrogation room
and an observation room.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.068
Both of them are locked and sealed
and completely soundproof.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.322
Only the monitors and cameras
in both connect the two.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.742
We call it the ESP game.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.535
The rules are simple.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.120
It's a card guessing game.

10:21.203 --> 10:26.959
You guess how the dealer in another room
will line up cards. Here's how it works.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.712
First, the dealer lays out the cards.

10:30.588 --> 10:34.175
You can see the area in front of them
via the monitors.

10:34.383 --> 10:38.054
Once the dealer lays out the cards,
we lay out our own.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.222
Then all three of us reveal our hands.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.810
The one whose cards match
the dealers most often wins.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.854
They win one point for every correct card.

10:46.937 --> 10:50.900
I see. Nice and simple.
How much shall we bet?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.612
Yumeko, that's not how we do it.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.489
Don't you even dare.

10:57.031 --> 11:01.118
We're not going to waste our time
with something as stupid as money.

11:01.202 --> 11:05.581
The winner of the game
pulls the trigger once for every win.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.293
You can put in as many bullets as you like
and spin the chamber.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.630
The maximum you can load it with
is six bullets.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.133
You can put a bullet in every chamber,
or not a single one.

11:16.717 --> 11:21.347
Once that's done, we each conceal our gun
so that you can't tell the difference.

11:21.764 --> 11:27.853
The winner takes one gun and pulls
the trigger once for every victory.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.981
Whoever gets hit
with a single bullet loses!

11:32.608 --> 11:35.653
Well? Fun game, huh?

11:36.237 --> 11:39.115
Um, that's an air gun or something, rig--

11:47.623 --> 11:52.378
Got it? Let's get started, Yumeko.
You're the only one I can count on.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.923
Let's have the best game
and the best killing.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.967
Don't worry.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.553
You don't usually die from one shot.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.431
And I'll take you right to a hospital!

12:04.515 --> 12:08.102
Or maybe you're worried
about what will happen if you kill me?

12:08.811 --> 12:13.482
You idiot! Don't worry!
The president will take care of it.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.862
A shooting in the school
would ruin our reputation after all.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.365
She'll make sure nobody finds out.

12:21.949 --> 12:28.289
You don't even have to worry
about a thing. Let's have a great time!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.417
Is she crazy?

12:32.042 --> 12:35.212
Let's go, Yumeko. There's no need to...

12:38.090 --> 12:39.091
Hey, you.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.678
Why are you trying to wreck our fun?

12:43.596 --> 12:48.184
The student council president won't
do this with me. Yumeko's all I've got.

12:48.934 --> 12:49.935
Please.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.104
Let me do it.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.273
I can't take it anymore.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.775
I'm going crazy!

12:57.359 --> 12:59.987
You're insane! Let us out!

13:00.070 --> 13:03.908
Why? I'm begging you!

13:05.075 --> 13:08.996
This game is insane. We won't do it,
no matter how much you beg!

13:10.873 --> 13:13.751
Fine.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.005
You're in the way.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.258
Now, now. Calm down.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.721
I didn't say a thing about not playing.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.264
Yumeko...

13:27.848 --> 13:31.018
It seems a little primitive
for a game of chance.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.105
But if you're that insistent
then I have no choice. I accept.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.734
What are you talking about?
You can't possibly...

13:42.196 --> 13:43.739
You're kidding me.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.616
It's like you're...

13:47.826 --> 13:49.036
you're the same!

13:53.999 --> 13:57.628
This is Ceylon Dimbula tea.
It smells wonderful, doesn't it?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.005
I hope you like it.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.844
I enjoyed the party.

14:06.512 --> 14:11.058
You're the first to win from us an amount
in the hundreds of millions of yen.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.145
Normally, people don't notice the loophole
in the debt swapping rules.

14:15.229 --> 14:19.275
And even if someone does,
they're happy to skim some pocket change.

14:19.817 --> 14:24.488
It's boring. You gave up the title
of Mittens and paid off your debts, right?

14:25.364 --> 14:29.285
We'll have to get rid of the life plan
we created for you.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.954
That's a huge loss.

14:34.290 --> 14:39.753
So, what? That's just something
you tried to force on me.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.464
Well, it doesn't matter.

14:44.133 --> 14:44.967
Mary.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.179
Join the student council.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.976
I have three conditions
for accepting this game.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.937
Three games maximum.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.732
Ryota will be the dealer.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.236
And the loser must pay one billion yen
to the winner.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.825
Do you understand the situation?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.244
Why are you setting conditions for me?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.497
You're crazy.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.754
Hmm... One billion, huh?

15:21.837 --> 15:26.216
That's fine, I don't care about money.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.179
And I don't care if this... Ryota
is the dealer.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.514
You're suspicious that I'll cheat, right?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.600
But...

15:34.683 --> 15:37.269
Why only three games?

15:37.853 --> 15:40.773
You're not trying to set up a tie, right?

15:41.357 --> 15:46.862
Winning all the card games,
and then missing every shot?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.280
I couldn't say.

15:50.366 --> 15:55.579
Fine! A girl like you would never
show me a boring game.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.790
I believe in you.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.750
But I need insurance.

16:00.334 --> 16:05.589
I'm adding a rule. Every missed shot means
your opponent can take one shot at you.

16:05.673 --> 16:10.469
- If you agree, three games is fine.
- Yes, that's fine.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.388
Okay, let's get started.

16:12.471 --> 16:17.226
What? But then even if you win,
you can't deliberately miss.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.728
One of you is going to be shot.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.856
Ryota, we're going to the monitoring room.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.778
If you're the dealer,
then I don't have to worry.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.155
She's putting too much faith in me.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.534
Depending on the cards I lay out,
Yumeko might die.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.506
Ryota...

16:48.090 --> 16:49.466
it's okay.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.387
Remember, we've got "it."

16:54.596 --> 16:59.309
- If we use "it" as a sign, we can win.
- That's the spirit, Yumeko!

16:59.393 --> 17:00.936
Okay, Ryota.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.521
See you later.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.273
Yeah.

17:07.234 --> 17:12.281
Sign? Can you tell what cards he's got
just by looking at his hands?

17:12.364 --> 17:13.949
I'd better be careful.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.119
Okay, here are the ESP cards.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.456
Line them up in the rectangle
so the camera can see.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.917
Don't show anything
but your hands and the card.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.173
The thing I have to be most careful
about here is cheating,

17:29.715 --> 17:32.342
Ikishima knowing
what order the cards are in.

17:32.926 --> 17:36.472
Right now, I'm not seeing anything
that would suggest cheating.

17:37.639 --> 17:41.894
The next question is how I line them up.
The problem is...

17:42.478 --> 17:47.775
If we use "it" as a sign, we can win.
If we use "it" as a sign...

17:50.611 --> 17:53.655
What is "it"?

17:54.990 --> 17:58.535
That's not funny.
Why would I join the student council?

17:58.619 --> 18:03.415
I'm serious. The talents that made you
capable of stealing 310 million yen

18:03.499 --> 18:05.918
from the student council...

18:07.294 --> 18:11.507
I'm telling you
that you're worthy of the job.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.759
It's impossible.

18:14.301 --> 18:19.098
Do you mean that you're refusing a request
from me, the student council president?

18:21.725 --> 18:22.768
Why is that?

18:23.310 --> 18:28.190
You should know very well the advantages
of being a member of the student council.

18:29.399 --> 18:33.278
So, why? Are you scared
of the other members?

18:33.862 --> 18:36.907
Then why inflict such a massive loss
on the student council?

18:37.741 --> 18:41.912
Or are you suspicious of me?
Then just say you'll think about it.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.999
It's not smart to just refuse
outright, is it?

18:46.959 --> 18:50.587
Why? I'm asking you a question.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.803
Oh, sorry.

18:58.428 --> 19:02.141
I can't understand
how you're thinking in the slightest.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.019
People like you who I can't understand...

19:06.603 --> 19:07.896
I love them.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.193
Ryota, hurry up.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.404
There's no point in thinking about it.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.822
Maybe...

19:17.739 --> 19:22.327
I was a house pet until just a while ago.
I can't do this.

19:22.911 --> 19:27.875
It wasn't my own power that freed me
either. It was thanks to Yumeko.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.296
That's right.
That's why I have to do this.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.882
Yumeko saved me.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.592
So, now, it's my turn.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.137
Think. What can you do for Yumeko?

19:40.554 --> 19:42.347
Think! As hard as you can!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.978
Looks like he's ready.

19:49.938 --> 19:54.276
Yumeko's goal is to make Ikishima think
we have a sign we can share

19:54.359 --> 19:55.903
so that she can win.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.907
If she knows she'll lose,
she won't use any bullets.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.493
Ikishima can't put in bullets
until she knows what the sign is.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.414
If I'm right, the sign doesn't matter.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.417
What's important is the fact
that I'm sending a sign.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.380
Two? Or scissors?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.799
What does that mean, I wonder?

20:18.217 --> 20:22.387
Can Ryota see what's going on our side?

20:22.471 --> 20:27.809
Yeah. He can't hear us. But he can see
everything, not just the hands.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.524
I see. I understand.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.777
Okay. First, load the bullets.

20:43.492 --> 20:48.121
Yumeko, you don't need to say
how many bullets you put in.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.832
But I'll tell you one thing.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.587
I'm putting in six!

20:57.714 --> 21:01.718
Ikishima just put six bullets in, right?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.136
Is she stupid?

21:03.220 --> 21:05.847
If we do have a sign, that's suicide.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.767
Does she know the sign is a bluff?

21:11.645 --> 21:15.649
It's finally time for a card game
where you bet your life!

21:15.732 --> 21:17.025
You're ready, right?

21:17.484 --> 21:18.527
Yes.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.873
- Okay, have him show the cards.
- Okay.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.167
Ryota, show the cards.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.546
I'll just have to pray.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.672
Please...

21:41.758 --> 21:44.428
I love this moment!

21:44.511 --> 21:47.055
Okay, here we go. Show your hand.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.821
Ikishima got three cards.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.742
Yumeko got two.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.745
Yumeko... lost!

22:11.079 --> 22:14.041
What? So, the sign was a bluff.

22:14.583 --> 22:18.754
It doesn't matter. You're ready, right?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.716
Yumeko...

22:22.799 --> 22:25.552
Don't let me see you embarrass yourself.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.898
Ikishima, I don't recommend
pulling the trigger on that gun.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.294
- Ever see the other side of the moon?
- That's cheating!

24:22.377 --> 24:25.297
- You're not scared to fire?
- Stop insulting me.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.465
- Someday, I'll kill you.
- Student Council President!

24:28.341 --> 24:30.051
EPISODE 7: THE GIRLS THAT REFUSE

24:30.135 --> 24:30.969
Goodbye.
