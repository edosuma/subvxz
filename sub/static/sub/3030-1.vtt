00:06.367 --> 00:08.437
<i>(young boy) Hey, Mowgli!</i>

00:08.527 --> 00:10.279
<i>(girl) Hush. It's starting.</i>

00:10.367 --> 00:13.677
<i>(man) Come, children. Come watch.</i>

00:13.767 --> 00:16.645
<i>Mowgli, tell us your story.</i>

00:22.207 --> 00:24.516
I never knew where I came from.

00:24.607 --> 00:27.599
But I always knew where I belonged.

00:33.087 --> 00:36.557
This is me and Bagheera, the panther
who found me in the jungle.

00:36.647 --> 00:38.478
He's a good friend.

00:38.567 --> 00:42.719
But my best friend of all
was good ol' Papa Bear.

00:44.207 --> 00:48.041
Man, we had
some crazy times together.

00:49.287 --> 00:53.678
And when the monkeys grabbed me,
things got really crazy.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.837
<i>(Ranjan)</i> Monkeys!

00:56.727 --> 00:58.843
Bad monkeys! Bad!

01:00.647 --> 01:02.956
Go, Papa Bear!

01:04.287 --> 01:06.721
<i>(Mowgli)</i> Then I came face to face

01:06.807 --> 01:11.278
with the meanest,
scariest tiger in the whole jungle,

01:11.367 --> 01:13.483
Shere Khan.

01:13.567 --> 01:14.443
<i>(yells)</i>

01:14.527 --> 01:18.486
You stay away from Mowgli,
you mean old tiger,

01:18.567 --> 01:22.958
or I'll tie some fire to your tail
and burn your butt!

01:23.047 --> 01:24.036
<i>(yells)</i>

01:30.247 --> 01:31.919
<i>(laughter)</i>

01:36.007 --> 01:38.077
<i>(roars)</i>

01:40.327 --> 01:43.000
I got him, Mowgli. Did you see?

01:43.087 --> 01:44.645
You sure did, Ranjan.

01:44.727 --> 01:47.560
But it's gonna be hard
to finish the story now.

01:47.647 --> 01:49.922
But we all know how it ends.

01:50.007 --> 01:55.001
Shanti blinks her big,
beautiful brown eyes at you,

01:55.087 --> 01:58.557
and you follow her into our village.

01:58.647 --> 02:02.162
- I did not.
- Did so!

02:03.247 --> 02:06.080
- Something was in my eye.
- Both of them?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.000
Well, you were so ugly,
you made my eyes water.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.235
Well, you...

02:10.327 --> 02:14.718
Now, now, we give thanks
for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes.

02:14.807 --> 02:19.278
Without them, Mowgli would never
have come into our lives.

02:19.367 --> 02:22.677
Come to think of it,
you used the same trick on me.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.281
And you still fall for it.

02:28.607 --> 02:31.644
Thank you for a wonderful story,
Mowgli.

02:31.727 --> 02:37.165
- Goodnight, Mowgli.
- Night, Shanti.

02:37.247 --> 02:40.284
Watch out for Shere Khan
on your way home.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.085
You and your stories.

02:42.167 --> 02:45.842
Everyone knows tigers
don't come into the village.

02:45.927 --> 02:49.681
Tigers go wherever they want!

02:51.767 --> 02:53.439
Goodnight, boys.

02:55.447 --> 02:59.326
Tomorrow's gonna be so great.

02:59.407 --> 03:01.443
Erm... nothing.

03:01.527 --> 03:07.477
Uh-huh. Well, you'll need plenty
of rest for doing nothing tomorrow.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.046
Off to bed.

03:09.127 --> 03:12.756
<i>(yawns)</i> We never get to stay up late.

03:13.967 --> 03:16.481
Even wild beasts need their sleep.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.718
<i>- (roars)</i>
- Help! Ferocious tiger!

03:21.607 --> 03:24.838
Goodnight, my little wild thing.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.598
Goodnight, Mowgli.

03:34.687 --> 03:37.076
Happy dreams.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.395
Erm...

03:38.487 --> 03:41.445
Goodnight, sir.

03:42.007 --> 03:45.966
Why do you always call him "sir"?
His name's Pop.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.044

04:24.927 --> 04:25.916
<i>(yells)</i>

04:26.007 --> 04:28.805
Come on, Mowgli, wake up!
It's morning.

04:28.887 --> 04:30.320
You said we'd go to...

04:30.407 --> 04:31.556
Ranjan.

04:31.647 --> 04:35.799
You want to wake the whole village?
When does the tiger roar?

04:36.487 --> 04:37.636
I don't know.

04:37.727 --> 04:41.197
After he catches his prey.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.001
His prey.

04:45.087 --> 04:48.318
Let's go get our prey.

04:52.447 --> 04:55.883
<i>(humming)</i>

05:03.767 --> 05:05.644
- Boys?
- Huh!

05:05.727 --> 05:07.558
Where are you going so early?

05:07.647 --> 05:10.525
To... do our chores?

05:10.607 --> 05:12.245
Not without breakfast.

05:13.927 --> 05:15.280
<i>(singing)</i>

05:18.767 --> 05:21.281
- That's OK. We're not hungry.
- Got to go!

05:22.207 --> 05:23.959
Boys! Where are you going?

05:24.047 --> 05:26.845
- To do our chores!
- Bye, Pop! See you later.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.805
Remember, don't cross the river.

05:31.447 --> 05:34.280
You can take the boy
out of the jungle.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.325
But you can't take the jungle
out of the boy.

05:37.407 --> 05:38.522
Yes.

05:38.607 --> 05:41.440
That's what worries me.

05:56.247 --> 05:57.839
- Hey, Shanti!
- Ah!

05:57.927 --> 05:59.485
What are you doing here?

05:59.567 --> 06:02.240
Getting water.
What are you doing here?

06:02.327 --> 06:05.922
Oh, I'm on the lookout...
for danger.

06:06.007 --> 06:07.998
Danger? Please.

06:08.087 --> 06:10.203
There's no danger around here.

06:11.647 --> 06:14.081
Well, keep this just between us.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.681
Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.235
Tiger tracks? Right.

06:19.327 --> 06:21.522
It's Shere Khan.

06:21.607 --> 06:23.325
I hear he's looking for me.

06:23.407 --> 06:26.843
Seeking his bloodthirsty revenge.

06:26.927 --> 06:30.966
So keep your ears open,
and always watch your back,

06:31.047 --> 06:34.119
or the last thing
you'll ever hear is...

06:34.207 --> 06:35.765
<i>(roar)</i>

06:35.847 --> 06:37.724
<i>(screams)</i>

06:39.967 --> 06:42.003
When does the tiger roar?

06:42.087 --> 06:43.805
<i>(both roar)</i>

06:45.247 --> 06:49.525
You're horrible!
Horrible, stinky boys.

06:49.607 --> 06:52.405
Come on, Ranjan.
He's a bad influence.

06:58.247 --> 07:00.886
Now, don't move.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.765
That wasn't very nice, you know.

07:05.487 --> 07:08.160
Stop that. You're not a jungle boy.

07:08.247 --> 07:10.477
Why are you so scared of the jungle?

07:11.327 --> 07:15.525
- Because it's dangerous.
- Dangerous? But Mowgli says...

07:15.607 --> 07:18.485
You shouldn't listen
to everything Mowgli says.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.797
But I thought you liked Mowgli.

07:20.887 --> 07:23.845
Well, I do. I like Mowgli.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.485
But I have... oh.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.961
Er, you left this at the river.

07:32.847 --> 07:34.883
Thank you.

07:34.967 --> 07:37.561
She's in a bad mood.

07:39.087 --> 07:40.361
Hey, Ranjan.

07:40.447 --> 07:44.122
You want to see a little trick
I learned in the jungle?

07:49.487 --> 07:51.364
That's a pretty good trick.

07:51.447 --> 07:55.440
Well, here's a little trick
I learned right here at home.

08:00.727 --> 08:01.876
Wow.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.923
That's a neater trick.

08:04.647 --> 08:07.445
Like I said, Ranjan,
don't listen to him.

08:07.567 --> 08:10.798
She's right, Ranjan.
Don't listen to me.

08:10.887 --> 08:13.447
Listen to the jungle.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.880
Can you hear it?

08:14.967 --> 08:16.844
Yeah.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.679
The jungle.

08:20.487 --> 08:22.079
Yeah, man.

08:22.167 --> 08:26.285
And when you hear that rhythm,
you get a crazy feeling inside.

08:27.047 --> 08:29.766
<i>That morning sun</i>
<i>peeks over the mountains</i>

08:29.847 --> 08:32.964
<i>And all the rhinos rub their eyes</i>
<i>When they hear</i>

08:33.047 --> 08:33.842
Hear what?

08:33.927 --> 08:35.962
<i>Hear the jungle rhythm</i>

08:36.047 --> 08:38.765
<i>Those birds</i>
<i>are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks</i>

08:38.847 --> 08:42.806
<i>The busy bee hums as he flies</i>
<i>Loud and clear</i>

08:42.886 --> 08:45.447
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

08:45.527 --> 08:47.916
<i>Now you can hightail it</i>
<i>out of the jungle</i>

08:48.007 --> 08:50.157
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

08:50.247 --> 08:52.715
<i>First you feel that beat</i>
<i>start bubbling under</i>

08:52.807 --> 08:55.275
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms</i>
<i>loud as thunder</i>

08:55.367 --> 08:58.882
<i>It's moving me</i>
<i>Sounds a lot like being free</i>

08:58.967 --> 09:00.844
<i>When you feel</i>

09:00.927 --> 09:02.963
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

09:05.247 --> 09:07.124
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

09:07.207 --> 09:09.767
Come on, Shanti.

09:09.847 --> 09:12.202
<i>Can't do without rhythm</i>

09:12.287 --> 09:16.599
<i>And when it fills the air</i>
<i>Animals everywhere</i>

09:16.687 --> 09:18.837
<i>Join in the dance</i>

09:18.927 --> 09:23.842
<i>You'll dance along with 'em</i>
<i>Feeling it steal your soul</i>

09:23.927 --> 09:26.646
<i>- We'll stomp our paws</i>
<i>- Flap our wings</i>

09:26.727 --> 09:30.242
<i>Maybe do one or two crazy things</i>

09:30.327 --> 09:32.158
- Khan khan.
- Yeah, that's it.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.477
<i>(monkey noises)</i>

09:34.567 --> 09:35.795
<i>(howls)</i>

09:36.967 --> 09:37.956
<i>(trumpets)</i>

09:55.447 --> 09:57.324
Shanti, try this.

09:57.407 --> 09:59.125
Not quite.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.560
There we go.

10:00.647 --> 10:01.682
No.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.042
Take a look. Perfect.

10:06.007 --> 10:08.999
<i>Check out those chattering</i>
<i>monkeys</i>

10:09.087 --> 10:11.043
<i>Swinging through the banyan trees</i>

10:11.127 --> 10:15.279
<i>Two by two</i>
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

10:15.367 --> 10:18.086
<i>Sounds like a wolf pack</i>
<i>way in the distance</i>

10:18.167 --> 10:22.160
<i>Singing pretty harmonies</i>
<i>Woo-woo-woo</i>

10:22.247 --> 10:25.045
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

10:25.767 --> 10:26.802
That's it!

10:26.887 --> 10:29.355
<i>Now you can hightail it</i>
<i>out of the jungle</i>

10:29.447 --> 10:31.677
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

10:31.767 --> 10:34.281

10:34.367 --> 10:36.835
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms</i>

10:36.927 --> 10:40.363
<i>It's moving me!</i>
<i>Sounds a lot like being free</i>

10:40.447 --> 10:44.759
<i>- When I feel</i>
<i>- When I feel, when I feel</i>

10:44.847 --> 10:48.157
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

10:49.927 --> 10:52.646
Wait. Wait stop.
You're crossing the river.

10:52.727 --> 10:56.083
Mowgli, you can't go in the jungle.
It's dangerous.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.123
Mowgli! Stop!

11:00.927 --> 11:02.645
Shanti, what is it?

11:02.727 --> 11:05.924
Children, come inside this instant.
All of you.

11:07.687 --> 11:09.200
Mowgli.

11:09.287 --> 11:11.562
That includes you.

11:16.087 --> 11:18.203
I am very disappointed in you.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.323
You put everyone in danger.

11:20.407 --> 11:25.322
You know you're not allowed to cross
the river, yet you disobeyed me.

11:25.407 --> 11:27.318
- But...
- No, Mowgli.

11:28.207 --> 11:31.404
The jungle is a dangerous place.

11:34.247 --> 11:36.761
I should know.

11:39.647 --> 11:42.639
You are confined to your room
without dinner.

11:42.727 --> 11:46.037
That should give you time to think
about what you've done.

11:53.487 --> 11:56.559
Mowgli, I was only trying to...

12:17.367 --> 12:20.882
<i>Oh, you can hightail it</i>
<i>out of the jungle</i>

12:23.847 --> 12:27.522
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

12:45.007 --> 12:46.998
Oh, Baloo.

12:58.047 --> 13:00.845
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

13:00.927 --> 13:03.122
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

13:03.207 --> 13:06.119
<i>Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

13:06.207 --> 13:09.802
<i>Oh, yeah! I mean the...</i>
<i>Do bah badda dadda de da dah</i>

13:09.887 --> 13:11.843
<i>Rum pah patta reet ta dah</i>

13:11.927 --> 13:14.885
<i>That bring</i>
<i>the bare necessities of life</i>

13:14.967 --> 13:17.242
Now, that's more like it!

13:17.327 --> 13:21.036
Look at you.
Growing like the proverbial weed.

13:21.127 --> 13:22.799
Let's see if you still got it.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.119
Take it away, Little Britches.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.366
Poor fellow.

13:30.447 --> 13:32.802
I said, take it away!

13:37.687 --> 13:41.123
Well, this ain't gonna work.
You just ain't Mowgli.

13:43.247 --> 13:47.286
I guess I got to get used
to singing solo.

13:50.047 --> 13:53.198
He's just not getting over that...
<i>(gasps)</i>

13:54.607 --> 13:57.167
Oh, no. Not again.

13:57.247 --> 13:58.646
Baloo?

14:04.087 --> 14:05.566
<i>(growls)</i>

14:10.287 --> 14:12.164
Mowgli.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.960
<i>(bird squawks)</i>

14:46.487 --> 14:48.284
<i>(bird squawks)</i>

14:50.167 --> 14:52.203
Get out of here. Shoo!

14:53.487 --> 14:55.284
<i>(bird squawks)</i>

14:59.127 --> 15:02.676
Now, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.396
Baloo?

15:10.927 --> 15:12.485
Baloo?

15:12.567 --> 15:13.716
Oh, man.

15:14.607 --> 15:17.917
Bagheera. How's it wagging?

15:18.007 --> 15:19.599
This has to stop.

15:19.687 --> 15:22.759
You can't take Mowgli
from the man village.

15:22.847 --> 15:26.123
The boy's future
lies with his own kind.

15:26.207 --> 15:28.846
Aw, his future can wait.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.758
I miss my bear cub.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.083
It's not safe for him in the jungle.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.317
Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli.

15:36.407 --> 15:40.685
Let Shere Khan try something.
We handled him once, we will again.

15:40.767 --> 15:43.964
- Baloo, don't push your luck.
- Out of the way, Baggy.

15:44.047 --> 15:46.766
You're not going near the village.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.081
Later, Baggy.

15:56.007 --> 15:59.238
That's it! Hathi, plan B!

16:02.087 --> 16:06.638
Hup, two, three, four.
Keep it up, two, three, four.

16:06.727 --> 16:10.515
Remember, men, our objective
is full and complete containment.

Prepare for Operation... Operation...

16:13.527 --> 16:15.518
Er, "Stop That Bear"?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.484
Very good, son.

16:17.567 --> 16:20.877
Prepare for Operation Stop That Bear!

16:23.487 --> 16:26.047

<i>Through the underbrush</i>

16:32.887 --> 16:34.161
Will you please stop?

16:34.247 --> 16:37.557
Brigade, halt!

16:38.487 --> 16:39.556
Huh?

16:42.967 --> 16:44.480
I told you, Baloo,

16:44.567 --> 16:47.639
there's no way we're letting you
near the man village.

16:47.727 --> 16:50.878
You ain't gonna stop me now, Baggy!
Look out below!

16:53.367 --> 16:55.881
- Search the water!
- This way.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.485
Nothing here, sir.

17:06.087 --> 17:07.281
Baloo.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.277
I've got him, Colonel!

17:21.367 --> 17:24.165
Confound it, soldier. That's a fish!

17:24.247 --> 17:25.236
Whoopsie.

17:25.327 --> 17:27.045
Disgrace to the uniform.

17:30.567 --> 17:34.037
Colonel! This log can't possibly
support your weight!

17:34.887 --> 17:37.959
Balderdash!
Why, my dear boy, back in '88,

17:38.047 --> 17:42.040
- in service to the Crown...
- Oh, no. Not again.

17:52.687 --> 17:55.884
They don't make trees

17:56.407 --> 17:58.125
Got him!

17:58.207 --> 18:00.596
Got him right here!

18:00.687 --> 18:03.201
Disguised as a panther, Baloo?

18:03.287 --> 18:06.085
It's me, Hathi. Put me down

18:06.167 --> 18:07.316
Sorry.

18:09.007 --> 18:12.079
Keep searching, men.
He couldn't have gone far.

18:12.167 --> 18:16.046
- My toes are getting pruney!
- Who are we looking for again?

18:16.127 --> 18:19.676
Confound it, man.
We're looking for the elusive...

18:24.807 --> 18:28.083
Don't turn me in, little guy.
I just want to see my bear cub.

18:28.167 --> 18:32.763
I won't. I miss Mowgli, too.
This way, quick!

There he is.

Ah! <i>(chuckles)</i>

24:28.887 --> 24:30.718
The jungle!

24:31.807 --> 24:34.958
What a weird scene.
Is that place always like that?

24:35.087 --> 24:38.318
You don't know the half of it.
That village was terrible.

24:38.407 --> 24:42.241
All you hear is rules, rules, rules
and work, work, work.

24:42.327 --> 24:44.318
Kid, watch your language.

24:44.407 --> 24:48.923
That's all they do! Washing,
dressing, fetching, cleaning...

24:49.007 --> 24:50.599
I'm tired just listening to it.

24:50.687 --> 24:53.155
Sounds like they're screwy
over there.

24:53.247 --> 24:56.523
I don't want to talk about it.
Especially Shanti.

24:57.367 --> 25:00.962
- Who's Shanti?
- Just a girl from the village.

25:01.047 --> 25:06.440
Hold on. Not the one that lured you
into that village in the first place?

25:06.527 --> 25:09.166
Yup. That's the one.

25:09.247 --> 25:12.478
I knew it! I knew she was trouble!

25:12.567 --> 25:15.957
I tried bringing her to the jungle
and she got me in trouble.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.116
Say again?

25:17.207 --> 25:19.767
I wanted her to see what fun we have.

25:19.847 --> 25:21.803
And she got you into trouble?

25:21.887 --> 25:23.286
- Yep!
- Ooh, man.

25:23.367 --> 25:26.040
She thinks the jungle is scary.

25:26.127 --> 25:29.164
- Where'd she get that crazy idea?
- You got me.

25:30.727 --> 25:34.276
Do my snake eyes deceive me?

25:35.087 --> 25:39.444
It's the succulent man cub.

25:40.407 --> 25:43.399
You're with me now, kid.
Forget that girl.

25:43.487 --> 25:47.321
You're better off without her.
You got everything you need here.

25:47.407 --> 25:50.843
And me?
I got my old singing partner back.

25:51.647 --> 25:53.205
Then hit it, Papa Bear!

or that village again.

26:47.847 --> 26:51.886

33:03.007 --> 33:05.646
Man is in the jungle.

33:05.727 --> 33:07.843
What does he want?

33:13.967 --> 33:16.037
Mowgli!

33:19.207 --> 33:22.438
Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy.

33:25.407 --> 33:28.319
Don't worry. We'll find them.

33:31.407 --> 33:32.681
Mowgli!

33:32.767 --> 33:33.916
Ranjan!

33:34.927 --> 33:37.316
Baloo.

33:38.247 --> 33:40.397
Uh! Almost got it, Baloo.

33:40.487 --> 33:42.125
Whoa!

33:44.727 --> 33:48.037
Them primo mangoes,
always the hardest to get.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.480
Got 'em.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.478
This is the life.

33:55.727 --> 33:57.046
Heads up.

33:59.927 --> 34:01.758
Delicious.

34:01.847 --> 34:03.599
Hey, check this out.

34:16.887 --> 34:19.639
Hey. Not bad.
Where'd you learn that?

34:19.726 --> 34:23.036
- Shanti showed me.
- Shanti?

34:23.847 --> 34:25.882
No. I, I said wanti.

34:25.967 --> 34:28.719
I wanti another mango.

34:28.806 --> 34:32.163
No, that's not what you said.
You said Shanti.

34:32.246 --> 34:33.202
No, I didn't.

34:33.286 --> 34:34.958
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.878
- Did.
- Didn't.

34:36.967 --> 34:38.320
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-uh.

34:38.407 --> 34:41.080
- I heard it.
- Who cares about Shanti?

34:41.167 --> 34:43.601
It's just a stupid trick, right?

34:43.687 --> 34:46.679
Yeah, right.
You don't need her, kid.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.917
You're with old Baloo now.

34:58.887 --> 35:01.401
What are you laughing at?

35:05.527 --> 35:07.518
What're you doing here, Baggy?

35:07.607 --> 35:09.279
Haven't you heard?

35:09.367 --> 35:11.483
Man is in the jungle.

35:12.127 --> 35:14.197
What do they want?

35:14.287 --> 35:16.403
They're searching for Mowgli.

35:16.487 --> 35:17.761
Mowgli?

35:17.847 --> 35:20.486
Perhaps maybe you
have seen the boy.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.444
Me? Uh, no.

35:22.527 --> 35:26.076
Well, you know
his future is in that village.

35:26.847 --> 35:27.962
Yes.

35:29.087 --> 35:31.840
I just wish I knew where he was.

35:31.927 --> 35:36.045
Yeah. Sorry.
I wish I could help you out, Baggy.

35:36.127 --> 35:38.925
Enough games, Baloo!
Give me the boy.

35:39.007 --> 35:41.646
Baggy, Baggy, Baggy.
I can explain.

35:41.727 --> 35:43.479
I can explain. I...

35:44.647 --> 35:46.717
I can explain, but I don't have to.

35:46.807 --> 35:52.677
As you can plainly see,
Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.919
I know he's around here somewhere.
And he can't hide forever.

36:00.007 --> 36:02.362
Well, he won't get past you, Baggy.

36:07.007 --> 36:07.996
Kid?

36:09.087 --> 36:10.679
Kid, where'd you go?

36:13.887 --> 36:16.924
You trying to scare the tick
out of my ticker?

36:18.327 --> 36:22.639
Wow.
The whole village, looking for me?

36:22.727 --> 36:25.924
- We can't let nobody see you.
- I thought they were mad.

36:26.007 --> 36:27.759
We got to lay low.

36:31.047 --> 36:34.244
They must really miss me.

36:34.327 --> 36:37.319
I wonder if Shanti's with them.

36:37.407 --> 36:38.556
Shanti?

36:39.567 --> 36:42.161
You definitely don't want her
to find you.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.605
Do you?

36:48.047 --> 36:52.757
No. We can't let anyone find us,
especially that girl.

36:52.847 --> 36:56.203
Come on, Baloo, we gotta get
moving. Lay low. Hunker down.

36:56.287 --> 36:57.686
Hibernate, like.

36:58.207 --> 37:02.803
Now, Mowgli,
what if that girl tracks us down?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.003
What are you going to do?

37:05.087 --> 37:07.203
Then you'll have to scare her.

37:07.287 --> 37:10.324
Scare her?
Has the milk run out of your coconut?

37:10.407 --> 37:14.002
No, she's terrified of wild animals.

37:14.087 --> 37:17.716
In case you haven't noticed, kid,
I'm no wild animal.

37:17.807 --> 37:19.718
Except at parties.

37:19.807 --> 37:22.924
I suppose I'm more of a honey bear.

37:23.007 --> 37:26.795
You can do it, Baloo.
You taught me, remember?

37:26.887 --> 37:29.082
You scrunch up your eyes like this.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.362
And show your teeth like this.

37:31.447 --> 37:35.520
And roar like this. <i>(roars)</i>

37:35.607 --> 37:37.404
Roar?

37:37.487 --> 37:40.160
No, no. Like you mean it!

37:40.247 --> 37:43.319
Do you want that girl to take me back
to the village?

37:44.087 --> 37:45.964
<i>(roars)</i>

37:47.847 --> 37:50.441
Yeah, man. That was great.

37:50.527 --> 37:52.006
Well, I don't know.

37:52.087 --> 37:53.645
Trust me, that'll do it.

37:53.727 --> 37:58.243
In that case, Mowgli,
consider that girl scarified.

37:58.327 --> 38:01.399
- Thanks, Papa Bear.
- Anything for my Little Britches.

38:01.487 --> 38:02.886
OK, let's skedaddle.

38:02.967 --> 38:05.845
Now don't worry.
I got a place downriver.

38:05.927 --> 38:08.646
- It's the perfect hideout.
- Real quiet, huh?

38:08.727 --> 38:09.557
Quiet?

38:09.647 --> 38:14.926
You want quiet, go back to the
man village. This place is happening.

38:15.847 --> 38:18.441
OK, here's the village.

38:18.527 --> 38:21.325
- We cross the river and...
<i>- (Ranjan roars)</i>

38:21.407 --> 38:23.716
Ranjan, be careful!

38:25.687 --> 38:28.485
OK, we went right.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.035
No, no, no, left. Left, I mean.

38:31.127 --> 38:33.925
Right. No, left, then right.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.520
Oh!

38:35.607 --> 38:38.326
This jungle all looks the same!

38:38.407 --> 38:41.604
<i>- (laughs)</i>
- Ranjan, what's that?

38:43.727 --> 38:46.685
Mowgli? He must have been here!

38:46.767 --> 38:52.922
Or some animal
with really sharp claws.

39:12.287 --> 39:15.597
That snake lied to me.

39:17.167 --> 39:19.886
Now, don't take it out on the water

39:19.967 --> 39:22.765
just because
you don't like the reflection.

39:23.647 --> 39:28.516
I mean, not everyone
can be born with such great looks.

39:28.607 --> 39:31.167
You let that tiger
get his claws on you

39:31.247 --> 39:33.636
and you won't be so good-looking.

39:33.727 --> 39:37.959
What? That pussycat?
He's harmless. Watch this.

39:38.047 --> 39:39.275
Oh, no.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.759
What's the matter, Stripes?

39:42.847 --> 39:45.441
Man cub got your tongue?

39:45.527 --> 39:48.758
Lucky, let's find something to do
somewhere else.

39:48.847 --> 39:51.441
No, no. Hang on, fellas.
I got another one.

39:51.527 --> 39:55.645
How many men does it take
to whup a tiger?

39:56.927 --> 39:58.280
Surprise me.

39:58.367 --> 40:01.086
None. A little kid can do it
all by himself.

40:02.047 --> 40:03.719
<i>(growls)</i>

40:03.807 --> 40:06.605
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
- Come on.

40:06.687 --> 40:10.043
In fact, we heard that kid
is right here in the jungle.

40:10.127 --> 40:13.676
Right under your whiskers.

40:13.767 --> 40:15.325
Interesting.

40:15.407 --> 40:18.046
I heard he's headed
back to the village.

40:18.127 --> 40:19.958
Wrong again, kitty.

40:20.047 --> 40:22.515
No, Lucky, keep your gob shut.

40:22.607 --> 40:26.122
They say he's headed downriver,
with a bear.

40:26.207 --> 40:28.926
Downriver, you say?

40:29.007 --> 40:30.679
Don't listen to him.

40:30.767 --> 40:33.964
Yeah. He's new around here.
He don't know anything

40:34.047 --> 40:37.323
On the contrary,
he seems to know quite a lot.

40:38.527 --> 40:42.202
Hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire?

40:45.567 --> 40:49.640
Isn't it ironic
that your name is Lucky?

40:49.727 --> 40:50.921
<i>(all scream)</i>

40:51.007 --> 40:53.396
Come on, lads, this way!

41:12.207 --> 41:15.916
This is the perfect hideout?
This is King Louie's place.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.682
Was, kid, was. He's splitsville.

41:19.767 --> 41:23.919
Me and the monkeys turned it into
the greatest secret hideout ever.

41:24.007 --> 41:29.604
Coming through. Hey, Baloo.
Good to see you back again, man.

41:29.687 --> 41:35.045
- Everybody knows about it.
- Then how can it be a secret?

41:35.127 --> 41:37.163
I mean, everybody who's anybody.

41:37.247 --> 41:40.239
Nobody who's nobody don't know
nothing about no place

41:40.327 --> 41:44.036
that everybody who's anybody
knows about. You dig?

41:44.127 --> 41:45.719
My head hurts.

41:45.807 --> 41:49.800
Turn the thinker off a minute
and just dive in.

41:49.887 --> 41:54.278
Step aside, and I'll show you
what a real rug-cutter can do.

41:55.447 --> 42:00.726
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

42:00.807 --> 42:03.162
the boss of bop, the jack of jive,

42:03.247 --> 42:05.920
the jungle cat
who's really gonna keep it alive.

42:06.007 --> 42:08.077
Get ready to stir it up
and serve it up.

42:08.167 --> 42:12.285
I'm talking about
Baloo is in the house!

42:12.367 --> 42:13.800
Hey, cats, alright!

42:16.967 --> 42:21.006
<i>When we start to move</i>
<i>Hey, honey, it ain't no joke</i>

42:21.087 --> 42:24.045
<i>We got a savage groove</i>
<i>We didn't learn from human folk</i>

42:24.127 --> 42:25.879
<i>No human folk</i>

42:25.967 --> 42:29.960
<i>Excuse our incivility</i>
<i>We're W-l-l-l-L-D</i>

42:30.047 --> 42:33.801
<i>When the music plays</i>
<i>All the people stomp their feet</i>

42:33.887 --> 42:38.563
<i>But a stomping paw</i>
<i>Can lay down a better beat</i>

42:38.647 --> 42:40.683
<i>Tell me we ain't naturally</i>

42:40.767 --> 42:43.076
<i>W- l-l-l-L-D</i>

42:43.167 --> 42:45.806
<i>It's a snap</i>
<i>To bring out the beast in you</i>

42:45.887 --> 42:48.196
<i>You're free like the bird it's true</i>

42:48.287 --> 42:51.245
<i>Or a frog or a hog or...</i>
<i>Oh, man, whatever!</i>

42:51.327 --> 42:55.639
<i>From the baddest cat</i>
<i>To the sweetest little deer</i>

42:55.727 --> 43:00.278
<i>Tonight's the night</i>
<i>We're gonna get our tails in gear</i>

43:00.367 --> 43:02.039
<i>Show me your ferocity</i>

43:02.127 --> 43:04.277
<i>Go W-l-l-l-L-D</i>

43:04.367 --> 43:06.358
<i>We snort, we squeak</i>

43:06.447 --> 43:08.597
<i>Up high or deep underground</i>

43:08.687 --> 43:10.996
<i>We snarl, we shriek</i>

43:11.087 --> 43:13.123
<i>We fly round and round and round</i>

43:13.207 --> 43:17.405
Ah, go, you sweet thing.
That's inhuman, baby.

43:17.487 --> 43:19.637
<i>The old mongoose</i>
<i>Gets good and loose</i>

43:19.727 --> 43:21.638
<i>The ocelot gives it all he's got</i>

43:21.727 --> 43:23.922
<i>The parakeet</i>
<i>Goes, "Twiddlee-deet"</i>

43:24.007 --> 43:26.316
<i>The red macaque</i>
<i>Shouts "Hang on, Jack!"</i>

43:26.407 --> 43:28.363
<i>- The tiny worm</i>
<i>- The pachyderm</i>

43:28.447 --> 43:30.278
<i>- The spotted cat</i>
<i>- The water rat</i>

43:30.367 --> 43:32.562
<i>- The great cuckoo</i>
<i>- The bear Baloo</i>

43:32.647 --> 43:34.399
<i>Are W-l-l-l-L-D</i>

43:34.487 --> 43:35.602
<i>Here's the thing!</i>

43:35.687 --> 43:37.643
<i>If we're broke, we never squawk</i>

43:37.727 --> 43:41.083
<i>We don't need to check no clock</i>
<i>To know what time it is</i>

43:41.167 --> 43:42.839
<i>It's time to rock</i>

43:42.927 --> 43:45.999
<i>When you dance like that</i>
<i>Hey, honey, it sure is hip</i>

43:46.087 --> 43:47.566
I can't stand it!

43:47.647 --> 43:50.605
<i>I want to tip my hat</i>
<i>But I got no hat to tip</i>

43:50.687 --> 43:51.881
I don't need no hat.

43:51.967 --> 43:54.117
<i>Ask me why and I won't lie</i>

43:54.207 --> 43:56.118
<i>I'm W-l-l-l-L-D</i>

43:56.207 --> 44:00.200
<i>We grunt, we growl</i>
<i>Up high or deep underground</i>

44:00.287 --> 44:02.437
<i>We hoot, we howl</i>

44:02.527 --> 44:04.836
<i>We fly round and round and round</i>

44:04.927 --> 44:06.838
<i>My oh me, it's plain to see</i>

44:06.927 --> 44:09.236
<i>We're W-l-l-l-L-D</i>

44:09.327 --> 44:11.238
<i>He, she, me, uniquely</i>

44:11.327 --> 44:13.443
<i>W- l-l-l-L-D</i>

44:13.527 --> 44:15.722
<i>Every beastie running free</i>

<i>W- l-l-I-I-I</i>

44:19.287 --> 44:20.720
<i>L- D!</i>

44:30.167 --> 44:31.520
Whoo-hoo. That's my boy.

44:31.607 --> 44:34.997
They don't swing like that
in your man village, do they kid?

44:35.087 --> 44:38.204
Well, no.

44:38.287 --> 44:41.245
Big fat no.
Say, what that village like, anyway?

44:41.327 --> 44:47.562
Whoa, don't bother the kid.
He told me all about that scene.

44:47.647 --> 44:51.640
Let me lay it out for you.
Those people are crazy.

44:51.727 --> 44:54.958
Everybody works and nobody plays.

44:55.047 --> 44:56.082
Oh, man!

44:56.167 --> 44:58.840
They got nothing
but rules, rules, rules.

44:58.927 --> 45:04.718
And there's even this girl who thinks
the jungle is a scary place.

45:06.887 --> 45:09.276
But, you know, it doesn't matter,

45:09.367 --> 45:14.157
cos Mowgli will never see that
village or that crazy girl again.

45:14.247 --> 45:15.760
Ain't that so, kid?

45:17.087 --> 45:19.965
Mowgli? Mowgli?

45:21.247 --> 45:23.238
Mowgli?

45:33.767 --> 45:35.598
Mowgli?

45:51.207 --> 45:53.675
<i>That morning sun</i>

45:53.767 --> 45:57.840
<i>Peeks over the mountains</i>

45:57.927 --> 46:02.478
<i>And all the rhinos rub their eyes</i>

46:03.167 --> 46:06.318
<i>When they hear</i>

46:07.167 --> 46:10.955
<i>Hear the jungle rhythm</i>

46:18.447 --> 46:20.836
Did we find Mowgli yet?

46:20.927 --> 46:22.519
Are you tired?

46:24.527 --> 46:26.040
A little.

46:26.127 --> 46:27.924
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

46:29.327 --> 46:31.522
Come on. Hop up.

46:31.607 --> 46:33.120
You OK up there?

46:33.207 --> 46:34.879
<i>(yawns "Uh-huh")</i>

46:37.327 --> 46:40.444
<i>How could it be</i>

46:40.527 --> 46:44.918
<i>Half as good as being free?</i>

46:46.167 --> 46:48.362
<i>Part of me</i>

46:50.127 --> 46:53.756

- Hear what?

47:03.007 --> 47:04.804
It sounded like Mowgli.

47:04.967 --> 47:07.083
- Mowgli!
- Ranjan, wait!

47:17.327 --> 47:18.726
Mowgli!

47:18.807 --> 47:21.116
Shanti? Whoa!

47:21.207 --> 47:22.162
Are you OK?

47:22.247 --> 47:24.238
Oh, I feel "vine".

47:24.327 --> 47:25.885
What are you doing up there?

47:25.967 --> 47:27.923
Hold on. I'll be right...

47:29.247 --> 47:32.876
- I can't believe I found you.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

47:32.967 --> 47:35.162
You out here, kid?

47:35.247 --> 47:36.999
Hey, Little Britches!

47:37.087 --> 47:38.725
Mowgli?

47:44.487 --> 47:46.796
You're not really helping.

47:46.887 --> 47:49.720
- Ranjan, stop pulling.
- It's her.

47:54.767 --> 47:57.122
That wild bear that carried you off.

47:57.207 --> 47:58.925
- What wild...

48:12.967 --> 48:16.403
My poor sneezer. That hurt.

48:16.487 --> 48:20.446
You come anywhere near Ranjan
and I'll really show you hurt.

48:20.527 --> 48:22.119
- Wait!
- Don't make me do it.

48:22.207 --> 48:24.926
Wait. Calm down. It's OK.

48:25.007 --> 48:26.520
But he's attacking us.

48:26.607 --> 48:29.326
Attacking? I'm the one
socked in the schnozzle.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.398
That's because you scared her.

48:31.487 --> 48:34.684
But, you told me to scarify her.

48:35.607 --> 48:36.881
- What?
- No.

48:36.967 --> 48:41.802
Wait a minute.
Mowgli, you planned this?

48:41.887 --> 48:43.479
Well, I...

48:45.567 --> 48:47.922
- Come on, Ranjan.
- Shanti, I can explain!

48:48.007 --> 48:49.884
Don't even bother.

48:50.647 --> 48:51.796
Shanti, wait!

48:52.847 --> 48:55.964
Man, you weren't kidding about her.
She's bad news.

48:56.047 --> 48:59.005
No, she's not. She was helping
and you scared her.

48:59.087 --> 49:00.440
Man alive!

49:00.527 --> 49:03.644
First, you tell me to scare her,
then, you tell me not to.

49:03.727 --> 49:07.800
Kid, I only got so much room in this
noggin, and it's filling up fast.

49:07.887 --> 49:10.321
You just don't understand.

49:10.407 --> 49:13.205
Alright,
how's about laying it out for me?

49:20.127 --> 49:22.687
Read you loud and clear, kid.

49:22.767 --> 49:25.122
You wanted that girl to find you.

- One of my den has a problem.
- I spent a night in the jungle.

<i>Can learn to be human, too</i>

01:03:47.887 --> 01:03:49.605
Whoo, baby!

Yeah, take it away!

01:03:54.887 --> 01:03:57.196
Crazy man, crazy.

Step, step, step, step aside.

And I'll show you
what a real rug cutter can do.

01:04:29.087 --> 01:04:31.203
Anything for my Little Britches.

01:04:31.287 --> 01:04:32.276
Hit it, Papa Bear.

01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:34.198

<i>Sometimes when night has come</i>

01:05:23.407 --> 01:05:28.322
<i>The river sings a song</i>

01:05:28.407 --> 01:05:33.925
<i>In my dreams it seems to leave me</i>

01:05:34.007 --> 01:05:38.125
<i>Right where I belong</i>

01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:44.446
<i>Wandering everywhere</i>

01:05:44.527 --> 01:05:48.566

<i>Somehow knowing I'll be going</i>

01:06:42.327 --> 01:06:47.003
<i>Right where I belong</i>

<i>Right where I</i>

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:08.084
<i>Swinging</i>

<i>Two by two</i>
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

01:08:12.447 --> 01:08:15.484
<i>Sounds like a wolf pack</i>
<i>way in the distance</i>

01:08:15.567 --> 01:08:19.242
<i>Singing pretty harmonies</i>
<i>Woo-woo-woo</i>

01:08:19.327 --> 01:08:21.841
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

<i>Now you can hightail it</i>
<i>out of the jungle</i>

01:08:26.487 --> 01:08:28.636
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

01:08:28.727 --> 01:08:31.241
<i>First you feel that beat</i>
<i>start bubbling under</i>

01:08:31.327 --> 01:08:33.716
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms</i>
<i>loud as thunder</i>

01:08:33.807 --> 01:08:37.402
<i>It's moving me!</i>
<i>Sounds a lot like being free</i>
