02:35.354 --> 02:36.222
Hello?

02:53.339 --> 02:55.241
What are you doing, Elizabeth?

02:55.274 --> 02:56.910
I am not Elizabeth.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.685
Lord, protect me from this evil.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.491
Our father, which art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name!

07:42.961 --> 07:44.964
- [Sylvia] Thank you, Mother.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.233
Thank you, Father.
Oh, you are very welcome,

07:47.266 --> 07:48.100
Sylvia.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.035
(bell chimes)

07:50.069 --> 07:52.938
- [Father] Thompson,
Sylvia's present, please.

07:52.971 --> 07:55.307
Now this is a very special
present, my darling,

07:55.340 --> 07:58.777
very old, and all the way from
America.

07:58.810 --> 08:03.215
It has been on a very
long journey just for you.

08:03.248 --> 08:05.751
Happy birthday, Sylvia.
Happy birthday, Sylvia.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.288
- [Sylvia] Mommy, Daddy, it's
lovely.

08:13.191 --> 08:15.528
- [Anne] He needs to be
punished.

08:17.996 --> 08:21.934
He needs to die.
Sylvia!

08:21.967 --> 08:25.271
- [Anne] Lift them and cut
your throat, my dearie.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.842
- [Mother] What in God's
name just happened?

09:06.278 --> 09:08.581
(screams)

09:32.638 --> 09:34.239
(yelps)

09:34.272 --> 09:35.674
I'm so sorry, Chris,

09:35.707 --> 09:38.744
but practical jokes have
never been my forte.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.346
Caught me unawares there.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.115
I'm in early this morning,
you see, lots of work to do.

09:43.148 --> 09:44.016
Oh.

09:44.916 --> 09:47.653
What are you working on at
the moment, Mr. Whittaker?

09:47.686 --> 09:49.955
I'm working on a new display
about the Warwick fusiliers,

09:49.988 --> 09:51.591
which is a very interesting...

09:53.859 --> 09:56.062
Hi, you all right, David?

09:58.664 --> 09:59.565
Morning, Chris.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.067
Better do my last rounds, Mr.
Whittaker.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.335
I like to get out before
the school kids arrive

10:03.368 --> 10:04.403
at the museum.

10:04.436 --> 10:06.772
I like to get to my office
before the very same.

10:51.149 --> 10:54.954
Label the keys, David,
label the bloody keys.

12:14.132 --> 12:15.200
- [Sylvia's Father] This doll
was found

12:15.233 --> 12:18.103
in the personal possessions
of Corporal J. Bradshaw,

12:18.136 --> 12:20.973
soldier of the Warwick
fusiliers, 1692.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.144
I regret--
(phone rings)

13:08.320 --> 13:11.390
Hello?

13:11.423 --> 13:12.291
Oh, hello.

13:13.959 --> 13:18.163
No, no, you know I don't
like those mobile things,

13:18.196 --> 13:19.932
they're just a fad.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.101
How's Dad?

13:37.115 --> 13:40.052
(foreboding music)

13:53.632 --> 13:56.235
No, I am listening.

13:57.636 --> 14:00.038
No, no, no, of course
not, I haven't forgotten.

14:00.071 --> 14:01.640
They're staying the weekend,
yeah.

14:02.974 --> 14:04.610
What time are they around
tomorrow?

14:07.178 --> 14:08.147
I mean tonight.

14:10.315 --> 14:13.051
This afternoon, no, it's not a
problem.

14:13.084 --> 14:16.221
It had only slipped my mind
briefly.

14:16.254 --> 14:18.457
(thudding)

14:26.097 --> 14:29.568
Yes, yes, I am listening.

14:31.069 --> 14:32.404
No, that's fine.

14:33.271 --> 14:36.909
Just drop them by the museum,
say 4:30?

14:39.110 --> 14:40.012
I'll see you then.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.181
Bye.

14:46.618 --> 14:49.988
Right, I'm going for a cup of
tea,

14:50.021 --> 14:53.959
and you are going straight
to Steph's office.

14:57.762 --> 14:58.631
Mm.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.336
That'll be great.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.237
Yeah.

15:06.204 --> 15:07.072
Thank you.

15:20.051 --> 15:20.920
Mm.

15:22.721 --> 15:23.555
Yeah.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.431
All right, thanks.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.365
Bye, bye.

15:33.398 --> 15:36.068
(sirens blare)

15:50.348 --> 15:53.085
(ominous music)

16:48.273 --> 16:51.210
(melancholy music)

16:55.814 --> 16:58.384
(phone rings)

17:01.553 --> 17:02.421
Hello?

17:06.590 --> 17:07.459
Hello?

17:10.762 --> 17:11.597
Hello, David.

17:14.398 --> 17:18.537
This doll, where did you get it
from?

17:18.569 --> 17:20.405
- [David] It was actually in
the fusiliers archive room,

17:20.438 --> 17:23.142
hidden inside some archive
boxes.

17:23.942 --> 17:27.613
It's a great find, David, great
find.

17:29.747 --> 17:31.350
- [David] I'm glad you like it.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.485
I do, David.

17:34.619 --> 17:35.687
I do like her.

17:38.389 --> 17:40.859
Oh and by the way, I'm in
tomorrow

17:40.892 --> 17:43.495
doing some more work on
the fusiliers display,

17:43.528 --> 17:47.566
and I'll be bringing in my
niece and nephew with me.

17:57.308 --> 17:58.177
Strange.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.317
(melancholy music)

19:01.940 --> 19:04.443
Evening, Chris, good day?

19:06.244 --> 19:08.380
Just beginning really, you?

19:08.413 --> 19:09.247
Nearly done here.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.482
Back in tomorrow, though.

19:11.649 --> 19:13.351
But we're closed tomorrow.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.519
For you, maybe.

19:14.552 --> 19:16.355
I'm in in the afternoon.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.429
You got a couple of
visitors waiting for you.

19:26.731 --> 19:28.333
Oh yes, of course.

19:31.469 --> 19:32.637
Where's the mum?

19:32.670 --> 19:36.575
Oh, she left them with me
outside as we were walking in.

19:36.608 --> 19:37.976
Seems in a bit of a rush.

19:40.912 --> 19:41.747
Thanks.

19:51.322 --> 19:52.691
Hey, ugly butts.

19:55.526 --> 19:56.395
Hm?

19:59.364 --> 20:00.765
What are you doing here?

20:00.798 --> 20:03.669
(chuckles) You both look
like you're in detention.

20:05.003 --> 20:05.938
Come on.

20:07.805 --> 20:09.508
Do you wanna see some cool
stuff?

20:12.343 --> 20:13.212
Come on.

20:18.416 --> 20:19.284
Lady.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.357
Right, kids.

20:26.557 --> 20:28.360
Now you two are very, very
lucky.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.762
Apart from your good Uncle David
here,

20:30.795 --> 20:32.530
and security guard Christopher,

20:32.563 --> 20:35.567
you are the only two left in the
museum.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.570
Now I've got about 15 minutes
of work left to do, hm?

20:38.603 --> 20:41.773
So how about you run around
the museum and investigate it,

20:41.806 --> 20:43.608
and see what you can see, eh?

20:43.641 --> 20:45.310
(tuts)

20:45.343 --> 20:46.778
(foreboding music)

20:46.811 --> 20:49.248
Back in one five minutes, okay?

21:06.698 --> 21:08.667
Oh, this is too heavy.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.567
This is very heavy.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.870
Try this one on, that's heavier.

21:13.137 --> 21:14.306
Oh, this one's nice.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.843
This is crazy.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.445
- [John] Look at this.

21:20.478 --> 21:21.680
Oh, that's cool.

21:21.713 --> 21:24.115
(ominous music)

21:24.148 --> 21:25.584
What about that?

21:33.558 --> 21:34.426
My god.

21:38.663 --> 21:41.600
(foreboding music)

21:43.501 --> 21:45.304
This is a cool hat.

21:56.013 --> 21:56.848
John.

22:04.021 --> 22:04.856
- [Anne] Beth.

22:15.566 --> 22:16.702
Uncle David.

22:18.736 --> 22:19.738
Uncle David.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.109
Uncle David.

22:27.979 --> 22:29.648
Someone wants to say hello.

22:53.571 --> 22:55.573
Have you seen the kids anywhere?

22:55.606 --> 22:56.708
There's one of them.

23:00.077 --> 23:01.146
Where's your sister?

23:04.015 --> 23:06.752
(ominous music)

23:08.986 --> 23:11.022
I didn't know you were still
here, Steph.

23:13.591 --> 23:15.994
Looking after your wonderful
find.

23:22.233 --> 23:23.435
Come on then, Beth.

23:28.005 --> 23:30.108
Would you like a lift, or are
you sorted?

23:33.711 --> 23:34.880
No, I'm fine.

23:35.780 --> 23:36.748
Making sure Anne is settled in,

23:36.781 --> 23:38.984
and then I need to run
a few errands in town.

23:45.523 --> 23:46.224
I'll walk.

23:47.658 --> 23:49.861
Okay then, Steph, have a lovely
weekend.

23:50.862 --> 23:51.763
Goodbye, Chris.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.200
Bye, Mr. Whittaker, bye, kids.

23:58.035 --> 23:59.637
You okay to lock the door behind
you

23:59.670 --> 24:00.471
when you leave, Stephanie?

24:00.504 --> 24:03.208
I've got to go and start my
rounds.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.750
Okay, thanks, I'll see you
Monday.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.054
Bye, Chris.

24:29.867 --> 24:31.069
(eerie music)

24:31.102 --> 24:33.972
(thunder rumbles)

24:44.215 --> 24:45.484
Hey, hey, kids, kids!

24:46.851 --> 24:49.855
Got a storm coming, just get
inside.

25:04.101 --> 25:04.970
Chris.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.080
Chris!

25:16.113 --> 25:21.119
Chris!

25:21.619 --> 25:26.625
Chris!

25:28.159 --> 25:29.027
Chris!

25:30.261 --> 25:31.062
Chris!

25:47.912 --> 25:48.880
Dead.

25:48.913 --> 25:51.349
(eerie music)

26:10.635 --> 26:11.336
Chris!

26:23.347 --> 26:25.984
(somber music)

27:17.735 --> 27:20.672
(foreboding music)

29:22.059 --> 29:26.331
Corporal J. Bradshaw,
what have we got here?

29:29.233 --> 29:30.101
The fuck?

30:02.867 --> 30:05.303
(somber music)

31:26.483 --> 31:27.886
- [Anne] Chris.

31:50.774 --> 31:53.344
(eerie music)

33:10.187 --> 33:11.055
Boo!

33:13.390 --> 33:14.525
Got you again.

33:29.606 --> 33:31.009
- [Anne] Chris.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.067
(thunder rumbles)

34:05.776 --> 34:06.677
The hell?

34:50.786 --> 34:52.156
- [Anne] Chris.

35:08.872 --> 35:11.242
(rumbling)

35:36.333 --> 35:38.736
(eerie music)

36:46.803 --> 36:49.674
(thunder rumbles)

37:35.419 --> 37:36.621
- [Anne] Chris.

37:38.322 --> 37:41.325
(suspenseful music)

38:05.082 --> 38:05.916
Die.

38:13.523 --> 38:14.392
Fuck.

38:16.426 --> 38:17.495
Jesus Christ.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.701
(thunder rumbles)

38:30.540 --> 38:31.575
John, Beth, let's go.

38:49.926 --> 38:52.396
(shushes)

38:52.429 --> 38:53.130
Okay.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.873
(eerie music)

39:15.652 --> 39:16.720
- [Sylvia's Father] This doll
was found

39:16.753 --> 39:19.623
in the personal possessions
of Corporal J. Bradshaw,

39:19.656 --> 39:22.526
soldier of the Warwick
fusiliers, 1692.

39:23.727 --> 39:25.896
I regret with all my heart
giving the doll

39:25.929 --> 39:27.931
to my daughter Sylvia.

39:27.964 --> 39:30.200
For it was my daughter's
birthday.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.803
I had, in my innocence,
decided to give the doll

39:32.836 --> 39:35.873
as a birthday gift to my darling
Sylvia.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.808
Not long after the doll
was given to my daughter,

39:37.841 --> 39:40.177
we noticed a strangeness in her.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.980
But it was at night when
the true evil came out.

39:43.013 --> 39:44.114
- [Anne] And cut your throat.

39:44.148 --> 39:45.816
- [Sylvia's Father] It
grasped at my daughter's soul

39:45.849 --> 39:49.119
and changed her to the
most violent of beings.

39:49.152 --> 39:50.120
Sylvia!
Within the journal

39:50.153 --> 39:52.756
lie the secrets of how
this evil came to be.

39:52.789 --> 39:57.561
For make no mistake, this doll
is evil in its purest form.

39:58.662 --> 39:59.997
Okay, all right.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.666
I need to go upstairs to my
office.

40:04.601 --> 40:05.736
There's a book up there

40:07.838 --> 40:11.175
that'll help us with this.

40:17.881 --> 40:20.951
(thunder rumbles)

40:20.984 --> 40:21.852
- [Anne] David.

40:27.924 --> 40:31.195
It's okay, Beth, Uncle
David will get help,

40:31.228 --> 40:34.498
and you can stay here
with me, where it's safe.

40:35.832 --> 40:37.034
But it's not okay.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.602
Now she's out.

40:40.871 --> 40:42.606
- [David] Who's out?

40:44.808 --> 40:45.910
Who's out, sweetheart?

40:47.077 --> 40:51.014
Be careful, Uncle David, she
doesn't like people too much.

40:51.047 --> 40:53.784
(ominous music)

40:58.588 --> 41:00.257
- [Anne] David.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.460
I'll be back before you know it,
okay?

41:04.761 --> 41:06.230
Okay, John?

41:06.263 --> 41:07.097
Okay.

41:08.565 --> 41:09.967
Okay, Uncle David.

41:18.675 --> 41:19.877
- [Anne] David.

42:07.257 --> 42:09.860
- [Jacob] With God's good grace,
we arrived in Massachusetts

42:09.893 --> 42:13.998
in late summer of 1691,
following nine weeks at sea.

42:14.765 --> 42:17.868
I thank the lord to be back on
land.

42:17.901 --> 42:21.939
The barracks are a welcome
home, the local alehouse moreso.

42:21.972 --> 42:22.973
Chirping merry!

42:23.740 --> 42:27.111
We drill, we prepare.
(clanging)

42:32.382 --> 42:35.686
We prepare for whatever mission
our king requests of us.

42:38.655 --> 42:40.857
My brothers of the sword
and I have been ordered

42:40.890 --> 42:42.560
to a town named Salem.

42:43.460 --> 42:47.831
Marched for two days in the
midst of a bitterly cold winter.

42:47.864 --> 42:51.001
We arrived gutfoundered
and in need of warmth.

42:51.034 --> 42:52.869
As we marched through Salem's
streets,

42:52.902 --> 42:55.405
our already chilled bones
were greeted by a cold

42:55.438 --> 42:58.642
that seemed to eat into our very
souls.

42:58.675 --> 43:01.111
My brethren and I noticed its
touch.

43:01.144 --> 43:03.146
A town full of fear.

43:03.179 --> 43:06.283
A town where peace had long
since left.

43:06.316 --> 43:09.386
We all pray to God for his
divine blessing and help.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.756
Accusations of witchcraft.

43:12.789 --> 43:15.258
The judgment of God was
set up through trials,

43:15.291 --> 43:17.661
to hear and determine the truth.

43:17.694 --> 43:19.630
But we see none.

43:19.663 --> 43:22.432
In its stead, neighbor
pits against neighbor.

43:22.465 --> 43:27.437
Suspicion and hate grow, its
fruit hanging from the trees,

43:27.470 --> 43:29.873
lifeless corpses for all to see.

43:29.906 --> 43:33.010
I swear 'tis not God, but
Lucifer himself

43:33.043 --> 43:34.845
who dances down these streets.

43:38.982 --> 43:41.652
(solemn music)

44:14.284 --> 44:17.021
(ominous music)

44:30.934 --> 44:33.270
The accusations were
started at the testimony

44:33.303 --> 44:35.238
of a few young women.

44:35.271 --> 44:37.741
Elizabeth Hubbard primarily.

44:37.774 --> 44:40.944
She and her friends took to
convulsing and body shakes.

44:40.977 --> 44:44.214
(thunder cracks)

44:44.247 --> 44:47.117
Soon after, more were
seized by this ill spirit.

44:48.151 --> 44:50.487
There could be no
explanation of these maladies

44:50.520 --> 44:52.890
to the townsfolk but witchcraft.

44:58.394 --> 45:00.864
I was present at a good number
of trials.

45:01.798 --> 45:02.999
A good few were found guilty

45:03.032 --> 45:04.868
and condemned to death by
hanging.

45:05.935 --> 45:10.207
Is God's justice here for
these judgements, I wonder?

45:10.240 --> 45:13.810
A dark fear has infected
the town of Salem.

45:13.843 --> 45:16.447
It grows, the air tastes of it.

45:17.114 --> 45:18.949
I feel the lord is distant.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.830
Anne, a fair woman of older
years.

45:33.530 --> 45:36.199
Anne was a midwife in
Salem for most of her life,

45:36.232 --> 45:38.902
and had helped many of the
townsfolk into the world.

45:39.602 --> 45:41.972
She gave toy soldiers to every
boy,

45:42.005 --> 45:43.440
and a doll to every girl.

45:45.809 --> 45:47.244
I find it difficult to believe

45:47.277 --> 45:49.980
that a kindly woman such
an Anne could be a witch.

46:06.996 --> 46:09.366
(eerie music)

46:14.637 --> 46:17.574
Uncle David has been a long
time.

46:36.292 --> 46:39.096
(thunder cracks)

47:06.222 --> 47:07.991
- [Anne] You all know me.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.828
Anne of Salem.

47:12.629 --> 47:16.566
A little girl was I when
we founded our town,

47:16.599 --> 47:20.237
and named it from the
Bible word meaning peace.

47:22.572 --> 47:25.008
You hypocrites!

47:25.041 --> 47:30.046
You speak of God, of love, and
of peace!

47:30.079 --> 47:31.114
Peace?

47:31.147 --> 47:36.186
For years I have shown you
only love and kindness,

47:36.219 --> 47:41.225
and this is how you repay me.

47:42.258 --> 47:46.230
I curse you all, and all of
Salem!

47:47.030 --> 47:52.202
The peace we named this
town after is gone.

47:53.303 --> 47:56.072
I now increase your hatred,

47:56.105 --> 48:00.377
and turn you against your loved
ones.

48:00.410 --> 48:04.247
Bellum omnium contra omnes!

48:04.280 --> 48:07.951
The war of all against all.

48:07.984 --> 48:12.456
Mark my grave not Anne of Salem,

48:13.957 --> 48:17.327
but Anne of Bellum!

48:18.394 --> 48:21.198
(thunder cracks)

48:29.973 --> 48:32.943
- [Jacob] Not one day has passed
since Annabellum's hanging,

48:32.976 --> 48:35.379
and we have been sent to
arrest Elizabeth Hubbard.

48:36.480 --> 48:39.549
She had most brutally
murdered those in her home.

48:40.750 --> 48:43.253
A cross down her own father's
throat.

48:46.289 --> 48:49.726
Beth has been put in an
asylum for her brutality.

48:49.759 --> 48:53.297
She had tremendous
strength, unnatural it was.

48:55.732 --> 48:57.367
The house is to be burned.

48:58.134 --> 49:01.972
We all took some possessions
before its purge.

49:02.005 --> 49:05.409
I took some small trinkets
and a doll for my niece.

49:10.046 --> 49:13.951
We are leaving Bellum,
Salem, glad to be so.

49:14.918 --> 49:18.755
On the way back, strange things,
odd thoughts enter my mind.

49:19.822 --> 49:21.491
Thoughts of violence.

49:21.524 --> 49:22.625
Jacob.
A voice,

49:22.658 --> 49:25.095
a voice I remember from the
trials.

49:25.128 --> 49:28.598
It tells me to kill, but I...

49:43.379 --> 49:44.581
- [Sylvia's Father] Not
long after this entry,

49:44.614 --> 49:46.516
Corporal Jacob Bradshaw was
arrested

49:46.549 --> 49:49.219
after he brutally
murdered fellow soldiers.

49:49.252 --> 49:52.756
Soldiers he had known and
lived alongside for many years.

49:52.789 --> 49:54.291
His trial was brief.

49:55.125 --> 49:57.394
I managed to investigate the
case.

49:57.427 --> 49:58.795
He denied murder and declared

49:58.828 --> 50:01.098
that he was under the curse of
Annabellum.

50:02.131 --> 50:03.533
The judge had him hanged.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.103
His belongings were sent home to
England.

50:07.136 --> 50:11.708
They lay undisturbed for 172
years, until I found them,

50:11.741 --> 50:14.744
and gave the doll as a gift to
Sylvia.

50:14.777 --> 50:16.579
I realize now that Corporal
Bradshaw,

50:16.612 --> 50:20.150
like Elizabeth Hubbard,
was not guilty of murder.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.185
They both did the bidding of the
doll,

50:22.218 --> 50:25.288
which contained the evil
spirit of Anne of Bellum.

50:39.902 --> 50:42.472
(eerie music)

51:11.367 --> 51:12.769
She's coming for him.

51:14.403 --> 51:17.474
(footsteps thudding)

51:19.609 --> 51:21.778
(shushes)

51:24.180 --> 51:27.184
(suspenseful music)

51:29.318 --> 51:31.521
God love it, Steph.

51:31.554 --> 51:33.557
For the love of God, no!

51:37.527 --> 51:39.463
Why are you doing this?

51:42.431 --> 51:44.834
God, for the love of, no!

51:44.867 --> 51:46.870
No, no!

51:47.904 --> 51:48.738
No!

51:50.239 --> 51:53.810
What the fuck, no, no!

51:53.843 --> 51:55.845
(shouts)

51:55.878 --> 51:58.848
No, for fucks sake!

51:58.881 --> 52:01.885
No, no!

52:01.918 --> 52:02.719
No!

52:16.365 --> 52:20.704
- [Anne] Bellum omnium contra
omnes.

52:26.242 --> 52:27.577
Get the scissors.

52:43.326 --> 52:46.263
I'm done with you, Stephanie.

52:49.498 --> 52:54.471
Lift them and cut your throat,
my dearest.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.001
(clinking)

53:25.034 --> 53:27.404
(gurgling)

53:41.450 --> 53:42.319
Beth.

53:48.391 --> 53:51.328
(foreboding music)

53:55.464 --> 53:56.833
Beth?

53:56.866 --> 53:59.269
Beth, are you okay?

54:24.060 --> 54:25.061
Beth.
John.

54:25.961 --> 54:27.830
Do you wanna play hide and seek?

54:27.863 --> 54:29.599
You hide, I'll seek.

54:30.466 --> 54:31.601
(shouting)

54:31.634 --> 54:34.638
(suspenseful music)

54:45.348 --> 54:47.550
(thudding)

54:54.390 --> 54:57.861
- [Anne] Go and get
the journal, my lovely.

55:03.632 --> 55:07.570
Okay, I'll put the journal in my
bag,

55:07.603 --> 55:09.572
then I'll go find him.

55:09.605 --> 55:10.573
- [Anne] Good girl.

55:20.015 --> 55:21.918
(suspenseful music)

55:21.951 --> 55:23.386
Let's find John.

55:25.388 --> 55:27.524
John's naughty, Beth.

55:46.475 --> 55:47.344
John.

56:00.956 --> 56:03.960
(suspenseful music)

56:34.857 --> 56:37.727
(thunder rumbles)

56:39.728 --> 56:40.597
John.

56:42.631 --> 56:45.635
(suspenseful music)

57:32.281 --> 57:35.051
(thunder cracks)

58:16.892 --> 58:19.028
(screams)

58:42.785 --> 58:44.921
(screams)

58:49.158 --> 58:51.761
(eerie music)

59:09.979 --> 59:12.815
(bell chimes)

59:12.848 --> 59:13.716
Hey Jim.

59:14.650 --> 59:15.351
- [Jim] Mike.

59:16.685 --> 59:18.054
- [Mike] Two?

59:18.087 --> 59:20.022
Four victims.

59:20.055 --> 59:21.023
Any survivors?

59:21.056 --> 59:23.760
One, a little girl named Beth.

59:24.827 --> 59:28.698
She says that Stephanie
Ross here killed her uncle,

59:28.731 --> 59:33.869
David Whittaker, her brother,
and the security guard.

59:33.902 --> 59:34.771
Shit.

59:36.005 --> 59:37.807
Any previous with this
Stephanie?

59:37.840 --> 59:40.143
That's the thing, absolutely
nothing.

59:41.110 --> 59:42.411
Motivation of any kind?

59:42.444 --> 59:43.313
Not yet.

59:46.081 --> 59:47.917
And is the girl hurt?

59:47.950 --> 59:48.985
Not a scratch.

59:50.653 --> 59:51.354
Jesus.

59:52.321 --> 59:53.389
Have you checked the CCTV?

59:53.422 --> 59:55.391
I have, the tape has gone.

59:56.659 --> 59:57.660
Where's the girl now?

59:57.693 --> 59:59.729
She's in the back with Kathy.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.231
(somber music)

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.671
Could you get a car around
front please, Kathy?

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:15.612
Hey Beth.

01:00:16.345 --> 01:00:17.413
I'm gonna walk you to the car,

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:18.948
and that nice police lady Kathy

01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:21.985
is gonna take you to your
mummy and daddy, okay?

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.721
- [Anne] Tell him to get the
bag.

01:00:25.754 --> 01:00:27.857
Can I have my bag please?

01:00:32.227 --> 01:00:33.129
Sure thing.

01:00:36.331 --> 01:00:38.901
(eerie music)

01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:54.210
(foreboding music)

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:29.005
(solemn music)

01:03:35.644 --> 01:03:36.779
- [Peter] Hello, love.

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:40.216
- [Beth's Mother] Any news
on how John and David died?

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:42.318
- [Peter] Nothing on John or
your brother.

01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:44.620
How's Beth holding up?

01:03:47.189 --> 01:03:49.559
- [Beth's Mother] She's in bed,
sleeping.

01:03:51.293 --> 01:03:53.462
- [Peter] Good, good, she needs
it.

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:57.600
I'm just going to pop up quietly
and make sure she's okay.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.636
- [Beth's Mother] Don't wake
her, Peter.

01:04:00.669 --> 01:04:03.039
- [Peter] I won't, I won't.

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:18.120
- [Beth] Daddy.

01:04:18.153 --> 01:04:20.556
- [Peter] (shushes) Yes, my
sweetheart.

01:04:21.957 --> 01:04:24.360
- [Beth] Somebody wants
to say hello to you.

01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:32.935
(clicking)
