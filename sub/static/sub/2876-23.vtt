WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:06.714
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.593
Oh, that's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.138
We're going to a conference
in Barbados. Right?

00:14.305 --> 00:16.682
- Uh-huh.
- Can you say, "Barbados"?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.517
Barbados.

00:20.562 --> 00:24.732
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so
much to me that you guys are coming...

00:24.899 --> 00:27.401
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.404
Ooh, and I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

00:30.572 --> 00:35.701
...but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

00:37.454 --> 00:42.332
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

00:42.959 --> 00:46.628
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

00:47.547 --> 00:50.466
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

00:50.633 --> 00:52.676
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.054
David'll probably want to hear
a few lectures.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.264
- Right, because he's a scientist.
- No, no.

00:57.432 --> 01:01.101
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

01:01.269 --> 01:03.062
...he'll die.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.355
Okay, we'd better go. Yeah?

01:05.522 --> 01:08.275
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- All right, let's do it.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.111
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

01:11.279 --> 01:13.739
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.117
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

02:14.050 --> 02:20.681
- Wow, this place is beautiful!
- Look at all these paleontologists!

02:20.849 --> 02:25.060
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.938
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.314
I think I've been recognized.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.861
- This happens all the time.
- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.446
That never happens.

02:36.614 --> 02:41.034
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

02:41.202 --> 02:45.873
- Wow. This is very flattering...
- I would love your autograph.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.835
Well, sure. Um...

02:50.003 --> 02:51.044
- "Dear?"
- Sarah.

02:51.212 --> 02:55.340
"Sarah. I dig you."

02:57.260 --> 03:00.470
- "Dr. Ross Geller."
- Oh, thank you so much.

03:00.638 --> 03:04.975
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

03:05.143 --> 03:09.229
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.
- Are you a paleontologist?

03:09.397 --> 03:12.941
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

03:13.109 --> 03:16.695
You probably recognize me from a
little show called The Days of Our Lives.

03:16.863 --> 03:21.575
Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives.
There's no "the."

03:23.745 --> 03:30.042
Okay, Ross, boy, you... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

03:30.210 --> 03:35.422
- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
- You don't own a TV?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.966
What's all your furniture pointed at?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.347
David, can you help me?

03:43.514 --> 03:47.017
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.020
Oh, certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

03:50.188 --> 03:53.732
...and Newton's third law of motion.
- See?

03:53.900 --> 03:57.361
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

03:57.862 --> 04:00.113
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

04:00.281 --> 04:04.868
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

04:05.036 --> 04:06.662
...or should Mike and I meet you?

04:09.999 --> 04:13.043
Mike? Who's Mike?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.505
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
- That's right!

04:17.673 --> 04:20.841
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

04:21.010 --> 04:27.307
- That's a blast from the past, huh?
- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.477
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

04:30.645 --> 04:33.438
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.610
- She does?
- Let's get you out of here.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.076
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

04:46.244 --> 04:50.455
I'm so sorry. I just...
I keep thinking about Mike.

04:50.623 --> 04:54.668
I'm crazy about David,
and we're having so much fun together.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.714
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...
That's gonna go away, right?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.216
- Well, I guess. In time.
- Yeah.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.052
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

05:04.220 --> 05:09.516
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.354
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

05:14.522 --> 05:17.024
I wouldn't read too much into it.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.819
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

05:20.987 --> 05:23.822
...that's not a good thing, right?
- Let me stop you there.

05:23.990 --> 05:28.535
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.997
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

05:32.165 --> 05:37.336
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.632
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

05:43.259 --> 05:46.636
- Well, you know Phoebe...
- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

05:47.388 --> 05:50.766
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

05:50.933 --> 05:55.771
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
- Oh, because his penis was too big.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.778
I'm sorry.
That's the kind of thing I do.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.865
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.951
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

06:10.703 --> 06:14.456
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.957
What?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.585
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.713
- No, I didn't mean now.
- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.008
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.844
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but..."

06:28.012 --> 06:31.390
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
- Well, you're welcome.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.183
Glad I could help.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.021
- How do you think I should propose?
- I'm pretending to read here.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.773
I'm sorry.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.196
Yeah. How you doing?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.657
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.493
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

06:51.661 --> 06:57.082
Ha, ha, I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.669
You really should have been
more clear about that.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.801
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.595
Oh, uh, uh, Britney Spears!

07:10.763 --> 07:13.723
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.686
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
- Oh, my God!

07:17.854 --> 07:19.980
- I know!
- Did you talk to him?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.816
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

07:22.984 --> 07:26.903
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

07:27.530 --> 07:30.240
- You ready to go?
- You're gonna go now?

07:30.408 --> 07:34.202
- I thought we could hang out.
- I can't. I have seminars all day.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.288
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

07:36.956 --> 07:42.502
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? It'll be romantic.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.337
Will you wear a thong?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.798
I will if you will.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.178
You got yourself a very weird deal.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.849
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.603
- So you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:59.770 --> 08:03.648
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.567
Joe, have you looked outside?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.153
No. Why?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.450
- Oh, man.
- There's an indoor pool.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.951
- You could swim there.
- Yeah.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.747
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.671
That "Mike" was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

08:26.839 --> 08:31.426
...with Phoebe and David.
- I do. Want a hint, huh?

08:31.719 --> 08:36.640
I do.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.059
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

08:40.227 --> 08:43.188
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

08:44.023 --> 08:48.401
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
- What? Why?

08:49.153 --> 08:51.905
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

08:52.073 --> 08:54.407
...and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.952
Chandler, we have talked about this.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.871
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

09:01.541 --> 09:04.209
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.503
I did! A penis one!

09:07.171 --> 09:09.756
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

09:09.924 --> 09:12.008
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

09:12.176 --> 09:16.555
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

09:16.722 --> 09:20.225
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

09:20.393 --> 09:23.395
...and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.356
Man, that's some bad advice.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.366
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.078
- What's going on?
- Everything is upside-down here.

09:40.246 --> 09:45.875
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.629
I don't want to alarm anybody...

09:49.797 --> 09:53.300
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.595
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

09:56.762 --> 10:00.015
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

10:00.391 --> 10:04.185
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.479
I'll show you guys where to check in.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.733
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

10:09.900 --> 10:14.446
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.490
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.411
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.998
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.208
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

10:27.376 --> 10:32.005
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.259
- Not Joey.
- Not Joey. No.

10:36.427 --> 10:41.264
- I was just lusting after Chandler.
- Yeah, right.

10:44.018 --> 10:48.355
So I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.231
Tonight?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.610
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.821
Oh, there it is.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.532
Yes, well, being a failed scientist...

10:59.700 --> 11:01.951
...doesn't pay quite as well
as you might think.

11:02.119 --> 11:05.538
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.250
And the clarity is quite poor.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.671
Nice.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.258
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.302
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.514
See what happens
when you give people advice?

11:23.015 --> 11:26.184
- Well, I hope you told him not to.
- That would be advice!

11:27.144 --> 11:29.270
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.900
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

11:34.652 --> 11:38.571
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you leaving the Supremes?

11:44.912 --> 11:50.375
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.627
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.463
Wow, really?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.383
That's fantastic!

11:59.427 --> 12:02.262
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.515
- What about Mike?
- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.892
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

12:08.060 --> 12:10.395
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.897
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

12:15.943 --> 12:19.237
You know? It's every girl's dream.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.907
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

12:23.075 --> 12:27.370
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike... David!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.416
David! I love David.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.335
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

12:38.424 --> 12:43.428
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

12:43.596 --> 12:48.475
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century."

12:50.144 --> 12:51.519
It's great.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.521
You'll be the hit
of the conference.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.231
It'll be even better tomorrow...

12:55.399 --> 12:58.026
...because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

12:58.194 --> 13:01.154
...checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.368
- Hey, guys.
- The chocolates aren't here.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.579
Damn it!

13:09.747 --> 13:12.081
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.752
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.047
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.049
What? May I?

13:23.719 --> 13:28.932
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

13:29.099 --> 13:31.768
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.980
- The wet season is June to December.
- It's not the time, Charlie.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.941
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

13:38.108 --> 13:41.152
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.491
Secret teapot.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.285
Your computer. I don't know what...
Everything's gone.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.371
- What do you mean?
- Must be a virus.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.790
I think it erased your hard drive.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.501
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.420
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

13:59.588 --> 14:03.675
- Why? Why would you open it?
- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

14:03.968 --> 14:06.469
- What did it say?
- "Nude..."

14:08.931 --> 14:10.598
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

14:11.976 --> 14:14.102
- I'm so sorry.
- What am I gonna do?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.729
- My speech is gone!
- It's not gone.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.649
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.734
No, I don't!

14:22.403 --> 14:24.863
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.293
- It's really gone?
- Yep.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.170
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

14:41.338 --> 14:44.340
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.718
- I just feel awful.
- Yeah, you should.

14:46.886 --> 14:52.557
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova?
She's never even won a major tournament.

14:53.183 --> 14:56.436
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

14:57.313 --> 15:00.690
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.902
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.487
Get out.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.909
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.952
- What do you do?
- I usually go...

15:13.120 --> 15:15.288
...play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.207
I can't believe this is happening.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.002
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.589
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.966
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.887
I don't think your monologue from
Star Wars is gonna help me right now.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.599
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

15:34.767 --> 15:39.437
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.
- What, you really think we can do that?

15:39.605 --> 15:42.774
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.109
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.403
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.158
All right. Okay, let's do it.

15:52.326 --> 15:57.330
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

15:57.498 --> 16:01.542
And then I move on
to what is clearly the defining moment...

16:01.710 --> 16:04.921
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

16:05.089 --> 16:09.926
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

16:10.094 --> 16:14.555
Ooh, ooh. Any chance any of this
happened in a galaxy far, far away?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.816
- Hello?
- Okay, Mike?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.902
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.697
So get over your
I-never-wanna-get-married thing...

16:30.864 --> 16:32.490
...and step up!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.534
Who is this?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.327
This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.746
Listen. Phoebe is back with David.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.082
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

16:41.250 --> 16:44.085
...but I know she really wants to be
with you.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.381
He's gonna propose?

16:48.757 --> 16:52.552
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

16:54.555 --> 16:57.056
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.059
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.979
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.567
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.028
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.820
What do you do in the humidity?

17:13.906 --> 17:15.074
Damn it!

17:18.078 --> 17:22.665
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Aw, I hope you're happy too, honey.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.001
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

17:25.169 --> 17:29.464
- That's what happens when you meddle.
- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.799
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.761
- There's no chance that will work?
- No, I called.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.014
- It's not gonna happen.
- Meddler! Meddler!

17:38.599 --> 17:40.475
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

17:40.642 --> 17:43.269
...then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.522
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

17:46.690 --> 17:49.400
...the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

17:50.110 --> 17:52.028
This vacation sucks!

17:58.118 --> 18:00.620
- I'm so bored.
- Mm.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.290
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.168
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.295
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.632
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.260
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.015
You feel like going to a convention?

18:21.517 --> 18:24.894
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.
- I know we're not...

18:25.062 --> 18:29.315
...but Frank Madaio and Eva...

18:34.196 --> 18:37.240
- Kate Miller.
- Kate Miller it is.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.784
- Okay.
- Oh, good...

18:39.952 --> 18:43.830
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

18:43.997 --> 18:47.667
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.341
Thank you.

18:57.761 --> 19:01.347
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

19:01.515 --> 19:03.599
...into the 21 st century.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.560
Well, yeah. That's it?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.604
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. We did it.

19:08.772 --> 19:13.151
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

19:13.318 --> 19:17.822
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.743
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.207
That's a pretty necklace.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.128
Thank you.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.673
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

19:35.841 --> 19:39.927
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

19:40.095 --> 19:42.471
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.435
Oh, my God, I love you.

19:48.103 --> 19:52.190
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

19:52.357 --> 19:54.775
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

19:54.943 --> 19:57.445
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.405
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.699
You've been married more than once?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.701
No.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.871
Mm.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.539
So why'd you break up?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.835
Oh, it was...

20:14.129 --> 20:18.424
It's complicated, you know?
She was, uh...

20:18.926 --> 20:20.009
...gay.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.427
Oh, my God.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.137
This is so cool!

20:23.889 --> 20:26.515
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.936
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.063
Hey! High-five!

20:33.899 --> 20:36.609
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

20:36.777 --> 20:40.154
My fiancé was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

20:40.656 --> 20:45.284
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.578
She didn't get any fitter.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.748
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
- I know.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.794
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.713
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

20:57.881 --> 20:59.757
- I know.
- And then...

20:59.925 --> 21:02.551
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

21:02.719 --> 21:05.471
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.348
I didn't do that.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.310
Me neither.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.358
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.653
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.572
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.829
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

21:29.997 --> 21:33.874
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

21:34.042 --> 21:36.836
...with the really nice breasts.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.130
But what about back home?

21:39.298 --> 21:42.800
Anything going on there?
Anybody you like?

21:46.596 --> 21:47.638
No.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.977
- There is. You're blushing.
- No, I'm not blushing...

21:53.145 --> 21:54.603
...and I'm sunburned.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.732
From, you know, the rain.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.608
You like someone. Tell me who.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.153
- Tell me who it is. Come on.
- No. Joey.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.947
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.158
- Who do you like?
- Joey, come on!

22:07.326 --> 22:11.746
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

22:11.913 --> 22:16.250
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

22:21.757 --> 22:25.843
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

22:26.011 --> 22:27.762
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Do you?

22:27.929 --> 22:30.598
- Yeah.
- Hey.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.850
- Hey.
- I just left you a message.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.894
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

22:35.062 --> 22:37.897
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.817
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

22:41.985 --> 22:44.737
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.489
- I had a great time.
- Yeah.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.116
This isn't over,
because I really want to know...

22:49.284 --> 22:50.743
Later. Later.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.829
- So shall we?
- Yeah.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.915
- Okay.
- Good night.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.375
Good night.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.802
- Okay, good night.
- Good night, Ross.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.975
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.977
She's clearly in love with Mike.

23:17.145 --> 23:20.981
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

23:23.777 --> 23:30.699
Um... Phoebe, um,
I have, uh, something I want to say.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.661
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.955
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

23:36.123 --> 23:41.627
"Uh, Phoebe, um, I would be honored
if, uh, uh..." Spit it out, David!

23:43.505 --> 23:45.005
Uh, Phoebe, um...

23:48.593 --> 23:55.266
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.310
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.521
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

24:00.689 --> 24:06.318
But, um, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

24:06.486 --> 24:10.281
So to that end...

24:12.492 --> 24:16.871
- Oh, my God, Mike.
- It's David, actually.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.205
No, Mike's here.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.792
Oh, hey, Mike.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.296
Hi, David.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.841
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

24:31.887 --> 24:34.388
It's the humidity!

24:37.309 --> 24:40.811
- Hi, Phoebe.
- What are you doing here?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.606
I have a question I need to ask you.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.526
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

24:47.694 --> 24:52.072
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.951
Okay.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.955
- Would you care for my seat as well?
- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.459
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.847
Phoebe, I love you.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.808
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.228
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

25:22.395 --> 25:25.105
...but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

25:25.273 --> 25:28.609
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.613
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.825
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

25:36.993 --> 25:40.538
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.164
If the rain stops.

25:45.418 --> 25:48.504
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

25:49.798 --> 25:54.510
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

25:54.678 --> 25:58.055
- I have a ring.
- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.517
But, Phoebe...

26:02.561 --> 26:03.602
...will you marry me?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.775
No.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.487
Ha-ha.

26:17.993 --> 26:22.329
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.748
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

26:24.916 --> 26:30.129
- That we had a future.
- We can have any future you want.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.388
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.808
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.770
Just so I know,
if I had asked first?

26:46.938 --> 26:52.651
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.613
Please, you don't have to explain.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.866
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

26:59.034 --> 27:04.038
...things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.915
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.335
It was a good trip.

27:13.381 --> 27:16.383
- Is it okay if I hug you now?
- Oh, yes.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.306
Because of our meddling! All right?

27:31.483 --> 27:35.736
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.738
Oh, I know.

27:39.491 --> 27:44.495
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

27:45.747 --> 27:50.125
- The sun is out!
- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

27:50.293 --> 27:52.086
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

27:52.253 --> 27:56.590
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.
- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.926
- No!
- Damn it!

27:59.928 --> 28:02.388
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

28:08.269 --> 28:13.107
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

28:14.192 --> 28:19.196
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

28:19.364 --> 28:23.117
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.787
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

28:27.747 --> 28:31.834
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.211
Giganotosaurus.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.424
- Argentinosaurus."
- Not to mention Coldsaurus.

28:41.386 --> 28:45.514
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.349
Their heads are already too big.

28:47.517 --> 28:51.228
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

28:55.984 --> 28:57.109
Really?

28:59.362 --> 29:02.489
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

29:02.657 --> 29:07.453
...that Homo ergaster is thought to be a
separate species from Homo erectus..."

29:11.207 --> 29:14.293
- What?
- He said "erectus."

29:14.669 --> 29:18.589
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he really said it.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.634
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

29:22.802 --> 29:27.598
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of Homo erectus..."

29:30.435 --> 29:31.810
Erectus?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.687
- Homo.
- Right.

29:35.940 --> 29:41.779
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

29:41.946 --> 29:43.697
Thank you.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.914
- Really great.
- Thanks, guys.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.708
I thought it was wonderful.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.377
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

29:57.545 --> 30:03.592
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and...

30:08.890 --> 30:11.809
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.063
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.816
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.403
- Take it easy.
- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

30:23.571 --> 30:26.198
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.826
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.411
Oh.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.372
I'm back.

30:34.290 --> 30:38.126
Okay. Well, excuse me?

30:38.294 --> 30:39.419
Hey.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.630
- Well?
- You were incredible.

30:41.798 --> 30:42.840
You blew them away.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.635
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

30:46.803 --> 30:50.764
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

30:50.932 --> 30:52.558
- I was not.
- No, it's okay.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.686
It made me feel like a rock star.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.106
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.401
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.740
Look, I took it too far.

31:14.998 --> 31:18.083
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.794
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

31:20.962 --> 31:24.172
...all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.594
Not you guys.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.680
You've got it going on.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.769
- What will we do today?
- They have a game room downstairs.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.479
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.857
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.109
- Let's play.
- I don't think so.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.654
- Why not?
- You know how competitive you get.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.949
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

31:52.785 --> 31:55.495
- I'm not always that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

31:55.663 --> 31:58.081
What happened when we played
last time?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.208
I punched you.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.296
- And?
- Phoebe.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.841
- And?
- I clunked your heads together.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.112
- There you are.
- Hey. Listen.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.658
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.536
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

32:36.704 --> 32:38.789
...he chases you.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.626
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.002
Oh.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.588
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.799
I'd do it alone, but, uh...

32:48.967 --> 32:52.260
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.347
You know, I feel so bad.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.392
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night...

32:58.559 --> 33:02.062
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.941
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.276
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.322
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

33:15.284 --> 33:18.453
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?
- Yeah.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.122
A little bit, yeah.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.004
I think we need to talk.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.174
Yeah, I think we do.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.470
About what?

33:38.683 --> 33:41.601
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
- All right.

33:41.769 --> 33:45.272
- I'll play if we don't keep score.
- Well, then how do we know who wins?

33:46.733 --> 33:51.111
- Nobody wins.
- So we're just four losers. Super.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.906
- Well, I'm not playing with her.
- I'm out.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.700
- I'll play you.
- Okay.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.536
- You don't know what you're doing.
- She gets crazy.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.205
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.126
I think I'll be all right.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.670
- You want to volley a bit for serve?
- Sure, if you want to.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.302
Ho!

34:16.012 --> 34:19.473
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.268
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.063
- You ready to play?
- Hell, yeah.

34:27.231 --> 34:33.070
- Did you know this about him?
- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

34:33.279 --> 34:36.072
- Want to make it more interesting?
- How much you thinking?

34:36.239 --> 34:38.074
- Ten bucks a game?
- Make it 50.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.868
- I'll make it 100.
- One thousand...

34:40.036 --> 34:41.620
Okay!

34:42.705 --> 34:45.206
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.376
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

34:49.712 --> 34:52.172
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.802
- Monica, you call it.
- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

34:56.969 --> 34:59.429
- Tails.
- Oh, what are the chances?

35:03.810 --> 35:06.311
- Hah! My point!
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

35:06.479 --> 35:10.273
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

35:10.441 --> 35:13.443
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.949
He was a lawyer.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.120
All the East Coast
is having beautiful weather.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.330
In New York, it's 72 and sunny.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.833
Oh. Weather bitch.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.878
It's open.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.631
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

35:35.508 --> 35:39.136
- What? Is everything okay?
- Charlie and I broke up.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.429
No. Why?

35:41.597 --> 35:44.391
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.518
That's crazy.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.312
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.649
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

35:52.817 --> 35:56.153
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.531
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

35:59.699 --> 36:03.451
- Man, smart people are dull.
- Well, hey!

36:03.619 --> 36:04.953
Okay, Rach.

36:08.082 --> 36:12.961
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

36:13.129 --> 36:15.714
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

36:15.882 --> 36:21.595
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like... What the hell's my problem?

36:21.762 --> 36:22.804
I just...

36:27.768 --> 36:33.440
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.693
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.197
- I'm not talking about her.
- Well, then, who?

36:40.364 --> 36:42.824
The waitress I went out with last month?

36:44.368 --> 36:46.578
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no, no.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.122
- Who are you talking about?
- No, I don't...

36:49.290 --> 36:51.791
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so...

36:52.376 --> 36:53.543
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.339
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

36:57.506 --> 37:01.384
- And I'll see you later.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.621
- You like me?
- Okay.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.916
- Let's not make a big thing about this.
- It's a huge thing!

37:33.084 --> 37:35.335
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

37:35.878 --> 37:40.674
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.426
Musings, if you will.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.264
- Well, for how long?
- Oh, only like a month.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.140
- A month?!
- Well...

37:49.308 --> 37:54.813
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.441
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

38:00.444 --> 38:03.530
- Okay, dial it up a little.
- Oh, you're right. Okay.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.240
- I just have a question.
- Shoot.

38:05.408 --> 38:09.077
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not trying to do anything.

38:09.245 --> 38:12.414
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

38:12.581 --> 38:16.793
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

38:16.961 --> 38:20.714
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

38:21.382 --> 38:23.258
...George!

38:24.969 --> 38:26.011
Who?

38:26.178 --> 38:27.721
- Curious George!
- Oh!

38:27.888 --> 38:30.473
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.101
- Of course. I remember.
- He had a paper route.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.103
Yeah, he did.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.773
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- No, I know. We're great!

38:38.941 --> 38:41.693
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.864
Can't it just happen a little bit?

38:48.159 --> 38:51.244
- No! It can't happen at all!
- Why not?

38:51.412 --> 38:55.457
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

38:55.624 --> 38:58.960
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

38:59.128 --> 39:02.422
...and not once did I ever say no.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.054
I couldn't do it to Ross.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.932
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
- I know. I know...

39:13.100 --> 39:18.813
...but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.692
I'm sorry.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.697
I'm sorry too.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.787
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.581
- Like you said, it's no big deal.
- It's not a big deal.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.708
- No big deal.
- It's so not a big deal.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.086
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.
- Okay, great.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.691
Okay... Oh!

40:16.664 --> 40:20.959
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...
I think that may have missed the table.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.836
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.129
- Do you?
- Yeah.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.172
- Do you?
- Yeah!

40:27.174 --> 40:30.260
- You really find this attractive on him?
- Oh, yeah.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.389
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

40:40.771 --> 40:44.774
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.902
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.697
Knock that dog off her head.

40:53.325 --> 40:56.578
- Oh, damn it!
- I sleep with him!

40:58.789 --> 41:01.166
- Game point.
- Don't get too cocky.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.876
Remember, I won the last one.

41:03.043 --> 41:06.004
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

41:06.172 --> 41:09.090
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

41:13.512 --> 41:17.557
- No! No! No!
- And that's how it's done.

41:17.808 --> 41:18.892
Okey-dokey.

41:19.059 --> 41:23.313
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.148
Everybody goes home a winner.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.108
- Best of three?
- What I'm thinking.

41:27.276 --> 41:31.988
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

41:33.574 --> 41:35.909
- Serve the ball, chump.
- "Serve the ball, chump."

41:36.076 --> 41:39.704
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.918
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

41:45.085 --> 41:48.546
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

41:50.007 --> 41:51.966
...just nifty.

41:53.969 --> 41:59.098
Well, I've kind of got a lot
on my plate right now.

41:59.266 --> 42:03.520
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.233
- Jarvis?
- Oh, you're back.

42:09.652 --> 42:13.488
- This is my wife, Nancy.
- Well, get out!

42:15.032 --> 42:16.908
Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?

42:17.117 --> 42:18.284
Yes, please.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.998
So, what's going on?

42:26.126 --> 42:29.754
Well, Joey and I broke up.

42:30.464 --> 42:35.885
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Joey is a great guy...

42:36.053 --> 42:38.388
...but we're just...
We're so different.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.891
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

42:42.059 --> 42:44.561
I knew that was him!

42:46.313 --> 42:50.108
Anyway, I just...
I think it's for the best.

42:51.068 --> 42:55.154
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I guess.

42:57.866 --> 42:59.826
There was...

43:00.995 --> 43:05.915
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

43:06.667 --> 43:12.547
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.718
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

43:16.885 --> 43:19.220
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

43:19.388 --> 43:22.765
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.020
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?
- Or we could throw you both in now.

43:27.187 --> 43:30.898
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

43:31.066 --> 43:33.735
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

43:33.902 --> 43:37.780
...and most importantly
you will have to catch us first.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.366
Go! Go! Go!

43:49.376 --> 43:51.836
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.758
- Okay, look, enough is enough.
- No.

43:56.925 --> 44:01.220
- I just have two more points to beat him.
- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

44:01.388 --> 44:02.722
I mean, please, look at you.

44:02.890 --> 44:07.393
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

44:09.980 --> 44:12.440
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

44:12.608 --> 44:15.276
We missed our dinner reservation,
let's go upstairs...

44:15.444 --> 44:18.279
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

44:20.366 --> 44:23.159
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.079
You knew this about me
when you married me.

44:26.246 --> 44:29.207
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.668
Well, this is my sickness!

44:31.835 --> 44:35.546
- What about the obsessive cleaning?
- That's just good sense.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.635
Ow!

44:43.681 --> 44:45.306
- You okay?
- No, honey, I'm okay.

44:45.474 --> 44:49.435
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.526
Oh, my God. I can't play.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.153
- So you forfeit?
- Mike wins?

45:00.364 --> 45:03.574
I can't believe it. I lost.

45:06.870 --> 45:10.289
- No, you didn't.
- What?

45:10.457 --> 45:13.626
- Because I'm gonna play for you.
- You can't do that.

45:13.794 --> 45:17.130
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

45:18.132 --> 45:21.759
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.724
- Honey, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.476
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

45:30.644 --> 45:33.229
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.814
Because I love you.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.277
But you suck.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.405
You're welcome, sweetheart.

45:43.532 --> 45:45.950
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

45:46.118 --> 45:49.871
- Whoever wins this point, wins.
- Okay.

45:53.751 --> 45:58.546
- Oh, my God. You're good.
- It's like watching porn.

46:04.219 --> 46:06.971
And that's how it's done.

46:08.807 --> 46:12.769
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

46:12.936 --> 46:14.645
Well, when did you...?

46:14.813 --> 46:18.691
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

46:21.737 --> 46:25.072
- When did you stop sucking?
- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

46:25.240 --> 46:26.949
...to know how good I was.
- Why?

46:27.117 --> 46:28.951
- I don't know.
- Well, this is so great.

46:29.119 --> 46:32.038
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
- That's why.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.674
- They still looking for us?
- Yeah.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.761
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.222
The herbivores and the carnivores.

46:50.808 --> 46:54.268
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

46:54.436 --> 46:56.312
Oh, look out.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.072
- I don't think they saw us.
- I don't think they did.

47:12.579 --> 47:18.459
So I started to tell you
something earlier. Um...

47:18.836 --> 47:24.257
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

47:24.424 --> 47:29.762
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

47:29.930 --> 47:31.889
...for someone else.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.600
Oh.

47:35.310 --> 47:37.645
And can I ask who?

47:38.981 --> 47:40.898
I think you know.

47:42.109 --> 47:47.321
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so...

48:05.841 --> 48:10.428
- I'm sorry, we can't.
- All right. All right.

48:10.596 --> 48:14.056
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

48:14.641 --> 48:17.977
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.567
Or not. I mean...

49:02.314 --> 49:03.397
What?

49:11.740 --> 49:12.907
Oh.
