00:18.180 --> 00:21.172
Okay. Money Laundering 101.

00:22.350 --> 00:25.262
Say you come across a suitcase
with five million bucks in it.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.430
What would you buy?

00:27.520 --> 00:30.899
A yacht? A mansion? A sports car?

00:31.780 --> 00:35.102
Sorry. The IRS won't let you buy
anything of value with it.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.198
So you better get that money
into the banking system.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.908
But here's the problem.
That dirty money is too clean.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.786
Looks like it just came out
of a bank vault.

00:46.170 --> 00:48.161
You gotta age it up. Crumple it.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.798
Drag it through the dirt.
Run it over with your car.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.166
Anything to make it look like
it's been around the block.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.922
Next, you need a cash business.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.796
Something pleasant and joyful...

01:00.640 --> 01:02.710
with books that are easily manipulated.

01:02.810 --> 01:05.096
No credit card receipts, etcetera.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.392
You mix the five million _
with the cash from the joyful busmess.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.408
That mixture goes from an American bank...

01:22.790 --> 01:25.998
to a bank from any country
that doesn't have to listen to the IRS.

01:26.830 --> 01:30.379
It then goes into a standard
checking account... and voil.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.913
All you need is access
to one of over three million terminals,

01:35.010 --> 01:36.546
because your work is done.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.540
Your money's clean.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.883
It's as legitimate as anybody else's.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.315
Hi.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.777
What? You don't recognize me
without my tits in your face?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.570
How's it going, Raven?

02:46.660 --> 02:48.742
Actually, my name's Margaret.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.036
- You got that pay stub?
- Yeah.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.245
Great.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.848
Are they all like this?
With no company name? Just a number?

03:11.940 --> 03:12.975
Mm-hmm.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.778
-What about the safe?
-It's in the office.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.067
-You sure?
-Yeah.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.401
It's black, made of steel.

03:22.490 --> 03:26.074
Has one of those dials you turn,
like on my high school locker.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.070
There you go.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.575
So, where to?

03:34.750 --> 03:37.833
-What do you mean?
-I'm supposed to fuck you now, right?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.121
Oh, no. Mm-mm.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.927
-What, suck you off?
-No, we're good.

03:45.010 --> 03:47.342
Can you give that to the waiter
for me, please?

03:52.140 --> 03:55.359
It closed. Forty over asking.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.937
Jonah was born in that house.

03:59.230 --> 04:02.393
And Charlotte was born in another one.
We sold that, too.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.562
You sentimentalize property,
you can kiss profits goodbye.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.230
--I've been thinking about this a lot.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.821
And I... I know that
we're not in the best...

04:15.830 --> 04:17.331
Spit it out, Wendy.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.619
If we were to unsentimentally consider
how to protect this little nest egg,

04:23.720 --> 04:27.099
for the sake of the kids, given that
the feds have been to our house--

04:27.180 --> 04:29.717
Are you saying you wanna
put the assets in your name?

04:30.640 --> 04:33.632
-Seems like the smart thing to do.
-That's never gonna happen.

04:33.730 --> 04:35.971
If you get arrested,
they can freeze everything.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.101
That's not gonna happen, either.

04:39.650 --> 04:43.859
What if I, uh... What if we...
did something with the money?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.349
Maybe real estate?

04:46.160 --> 04:48.481
-Real estate.
-As an Investment.

04:48.570 --> 04:51.152
Wendy, I'm trying to save
our fucking lives here,

04:51.240 --> 04:52.616
not help your new career.

05:32.910 --> 05:34.195
Does it hurt?

05:36.040 --> 05:36.995
What?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.701
- Dying.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.410
Life hurts.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.047
Last year,
a 12-year-old kid from my school died.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.290
He had cancer.

05:52.510 --> 05:53.556
Well...

05:53.640 --> 05:56.677
"We're born astride the grave."

05:58.980 --> 06:01.437
-You know wll1\|at that means?
- o.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.726
Sit down.

06:06.610 --> 06:08.601
It means...

06:08.700 --> 06:09.815
...that we're...

06:10.870 --> 06:13.327
all dying the minute we're born.

06:13.410 --> 06:14.729
Goes fast.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.655
Don't waste it.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.241
Don't waste it.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.507
Would you die without that oxygen?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.210
Hey, I don't know.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.670
Am I dead yet?

06:37.100 --> 06:37.919
Hmm?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.476
Yeah.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.106
Wanna try?

06:56.910 --> 06:58.286
It's cold.

07:44.830 --> 07:48.209
I had a house up on a hill
With a little garden...

07:48.300 --> 07:50.120
Eduardo, Eduardo...

07:50.210 --> 07:51.416
Excuse me.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.585
Uh, listen.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.829
I hear you.

07:54.930 --> 07:56.670
Whoo!

07:56.760 --> 07:58.751
- Yeah.

07:58.850 --> 08:02.934
- Uh, listen, Eduardo... S, s.
- - Not bad. Not bad.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.306
Yeah. S. S, s, s.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.970
Uh-huh. Well, uh...

08:08.070 --> 08:11.892
Could you represent me in a deal?

08:11.990 --> 08:13.025
Um...

08:13.110 --> 08:17.649
Would that constitute
a conflict of interest?

08:19.410 --> 08:20.365
No?

08:20.950 --> 08:22.656
Gracias, amigo.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.915
Okay.

08:24.670 --> 08:29.494
Uh, Charlotte, um, any chance you can
throw on a windbreaker or something?

08:29.590 --> 08:32.798
-It's 94 degrees outside.
-Yeah, well, if it's readers you're after,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.541
why don't you put some Shakespeare
on your ass?

08:34.630 --> 08:36.791
Well, that's smart.
You know, it's 2017, Dad.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.630
It's not okay to slut-shame.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.518
Well, it's not okay to wear,
you know, Jonah's shorts.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.726
Unbelievable.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.937
What's that about you needing a lawyer?

08:48.020 --> 08:49.681
Don't know what you're talking about.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.897
I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.811
Uh, three years in high school.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.026
Sounded pretty fluent to me.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.732
Mr. Azria was a real ballbuster.

09:01.990 --> 09:05.403
-So, Chicago. That makes you a Cubs fan?
-Yeah, proudly.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.207
Lifelong affliction,
or just since it got fashionable?

09:08.290 --> 09:09.996
Uh...

09:10.090 --> 09:12.752
I grew up in, uh, in South Bend and...

09:12.840 --> 09:16.549
kinda came with the territory,
you know, like... God and football.

09:16.630 --> 09:18.928
-Mm.
-And football.

09:20.850 --> 09:24.763
-Well, I was raised to hate the Cubs.
-And I was raised to hate the Cardinals.

09:24.850 --> 09:27.432
Fifty bucks says Cards beats the Cubs
in this weekend's series.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.478
- Okay, you're on.

09:30.860 --> 09:33.522
Hey! She's 15, asshole!

09:35.320 --> 09:36.605
Shut down.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.196
Come on, honey, sit down. Over there.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.689
- All right.
- Be right there, babe.

09:44.790 --> 09:48.954
I walked on the dark side
Of everyone's everyday floor

09:52.590 --> 09:55.377
-Langmore.
- And wondrous fairies

09:55.460 --> 09:59.248
They walk through the crack
In the door

10:07.560 --> 10:09.096
Who were you just texting?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.227
Why's that any of your business?

10:12.150 --> 10:15.278
'Cause that's what this place is.
It's... it's my business.

10:16.570 --> 10:21.269
Did you know, um, last week,
after the O'Connors came in for brunch,

10:21.370 --> 10:24.828
that they got home to find out
that they were without jewelry,

10:24.910 --> 10:26.992
TV, stereo equipment?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.160
No?

10:29.250 --> 10:32.788
Well, I know you're only a...
a dishwasher,

10:32.880 --> 10:36.088
but just so we're clear here, um...

10:36.170 --> 10:39.719
people have certain expectations
when they come to a place like this, okay?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.540
They want clean silverware.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.598
They want unlimited refills
on their coffee.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.762
And they wanna know that,
when they are done eating

10:46.850 --> 10:50.729
and they come home,
all their shit is still gonna be there.

10:54.650 --> 10:56.140
She's a fucking thief.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.069
Hello?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.821
How's my money, Marty?

11:08.790 --> 11:10.360
Um, it's good.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.372
Uh, it's better than expected.
It's starting to move.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.626
I haven't even seen a million yet.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.371
So when you say "It's starting to move,"

11:18.460 --> 11:20.712
what do you mean, like, it's...
Check is in the mail?

11:22.430 --> 11:25.843
Uh, you're gonna have,
um, 500 small in 48 hours.

11:25.930 --> 11:30.594
The deal was eight large, okay?
This is feeling like a slow trickle.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.592
You know, it's not even,
uh, Fourth of July. 50...

11:33.690 --> 11:35.476
Ah, American Independence Day.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.316
That's right.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.140
You know what else comes in July?

11:39.780 --> 11:42.066
-Uh, I don't, no.
-My birthday.

11:42.150 --> 11:44.232
You wanna know
what I want for my birthday?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.942
-No.
-I want a good night's sleep...

11:48.950 --> 11:50.110
a good shit...

11:51.040 --> 11:53.247
and several million clean from you.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.950
I can help with the last.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.951
Just admit it, Marty. You're fucked.

11:58.800 --> 12:03.169
We're gonna kill your family, gently,
and be done with all this madness.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.671
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say to that.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.715
This is your clinical trial.

12:11.350 --> 12:15.093
This is your experiment and,
truth be told, I don't like experiments.

12:15.190 --> 12:16.259
They constipate me.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.686
Just trust me.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.648
No, Marty, I used to trust you.
Now I don't know.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.401
--Hello?

12:31.290 --> 12:33.076
Ruth, can I talk to you?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.580
Let's go to my office.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.597
-Want to rent the boat tomorrow?
-Yeah! Sounds like fun!

12:52.600 --> 12:53.726
Nice.

12:55.270 --> 12:58.262
Like a... like a serial killer's lair.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.227
-I have a job for you.
-I thought I already had a job.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.359
There's a safe in Bobby Dean's office.
I need what's inside.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.526
You're asking me to rob a strip club?

13:08.620 --> 13:09.609
Iam.

13:10.530 --> 13:11.690
Why?

13:13.040 --> 13:15.406
This is a situation
where the less you know, the better.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.201
And what's in it for me?

13:21.340 --> 13:22.796
If you wanna get ahead in business,

13:22.880 --> 13:24.757
it's questions like that,
asked in that way,

13:24.840 --> 13:26.546
that you're gonna want to avoid.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.922
- Fuck you. Is that businesslike enough?

13:30.010 --> 13:32.638
Listen, I don't like to give
extraneous details.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.223
There's a safe. And I need the contents.

13:35.310 --> 13:38.188
Anything else would be extraneous
or counterproductive.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.478
However, I... I will admit
that it is relevant to tell you

13:43.570 --> 13:46.858
that I'm offering you
ten percent of what's inside.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.349
And what's on the inside?

13:48.450 --> 13:49.906
That's where we get into
the extraneous again.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.982
It's at my risk. I want 80%.

13:53.580 --> 13:55.036
Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.247
As your boss, I hope
I'm not gonna have to negotiate

13:57.330 --> 13:58.877
every single time
I ask you to do something.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.872
-Fifty.
-How about I ask somebody else to do it?

14:05.460 --> 14:07.928
I'm gonna give you 25%. And that's it.

14:09.430 --> 14:10.499
How about a nod?

14:12.010 --> 14:13.637
Great. Thank you.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.629
For a stripper job,

15:42.730 --> 15:45.688
you probably should've come dressed
a little more provocative.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.196
You ever dance before?

15:53.660 --> 15:54.979
A little bit.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.776
Bullshit.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.076
You're how old?

15:58.660 --> 15:59.945
Nineteen.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.247
-What year were you born?
-1998.

16:08.500 --> 16:12.789
Stripping might be every girl's dream,
but it might not be for every girl.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.170
Read me?

16:17.220 --> 16:18.596
Turn around.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.146
Pull your pants up.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.852
Up higher. Up more, up your ass.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.231
--Okay.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.736
Might be something to work with.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.780
Turn back around.

16:48.380 --> 16:52.749
So there are two types of dances.
Stage dance and a lap dance.

16:52.840 --> 16:57.004
Now, stage dance,
merely an advertisement for a lap dance.

16:57.760 --> 17:01.469
Stage dance, guys tossing singles
up there, might be interested.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.676
But his dick ain't necessarily hard.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.183
A lap dance...
now that's dancing around a hard dick.

17:08.270 --> 17:11.603
And a hard dick presents opportunities.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.100
You understand what I mean by that?

17:18.370 --> 17:20.361
What do I mean by that?

17:21.660 --> 17:23.537
I know what opportunities are.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.529
Okay.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.957
Well, you're no fucking beauty.
You know that, right?

17:31.550 --> 17:33.586
Ain't necessarily a bad thing.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.673
More important is,
you know how to tease a man.

17:38.180 --> 17:38.999
Do you?

17:48.310 --> 17:49.220
I don't know.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.606
You tell me.

17:57.450 --> 17:59.771
What do you think I'm thinking about?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.366
- Right now.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.160
All right.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.087
Move on to the audition part
of the interview.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.950
Go on. Close the door.

19:06.390 --> 19:08.927
Well, it ain't gonna suck itself,
sweetheart.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.472
What the fuck?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.858
I guess you're right.
Stripping isn't for everyone.

19:19.610 --> 19:21.601
Fuck!

20:49.790 --> 20:52.748
-Hello?
-I need two grand.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.572
What? Two grand? No chance.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.163
-I got expenses.
-What kind of expenses?

21:00.250 --> 21:03.048
The club has cameras, an alarm system.

21:03.130 --> 21:04.836
I'm gonna have to go
during business hours.

21:05.380 --> 21:08.349
You care to tell me_
exactly how you plan on domg that?

21:08.430 --> 21:11.593
Yeah, it's really a situation
where the less you know, the better.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.261
Marty, you there?

21:23.150 --> 21:24.139
Marty?

21:25.570 --> 21:28.698
Um, yeah. Whatever you need, it's fine.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.757
Hey. I was just out on the lake,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.172
-and there is this property and--
-Um, listen, Wendy.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.808
It's half-built,
it's stalled and it's for sale.

21:52.890 --> 21:55.176
-We gotta talk about something, please.
-Look, I know...

21:55.270 --> 21:56.259
Um... Let me talk.

21:56.350 --> 21:59.513
...I should never have said
that we should put the assets in my name.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.932
-But I really think we can launder money--
-Wendy, this is about Jonah.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.981
It could just be a phase.

22:08.070 --> 22:10.527
I mean, I remember 13-year-old boys.
It's all raging hormones

22:10.620 --> 22:12.656
-and unparalleled cluelessness.
-Come on. Please.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.617
Did you or any other 13-year-olds
you know

22:14.700 --> 22:16.531
go through a disemboweling-animals phase?

22:16.620 --> 22:19.498
-That's ridiculous.
-I just think he needs to find a friend.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.332
-Someone to hang outwith.
-He didn't have friends in Chicago.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.797
No. Well, he just hasn't found
his crowd yet.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.370
-You're being soft.
-I'm not being soft.

22:28.470 --> 22:30.006
You are. You're minimizing the problem,

22:30.090 --> 22:32.638
and you're rationalizing.
That's what you accuse me of doing.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.053
No, I'm giving Jonah
the benefit of the doubt.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.176
-And what am I doing?
-Maybe you could do the same.

22:38.270 --> 22:39.931
I'm concerned.
Why should I feel guilty about that?

22:40.020 --> 22:40.930
Well, I'm concerned!

22:41.020 --> 22:43.568
-It doesn't sound like it.
-He's messmg wrth dead animals.

22:43.650 --> 22:46.141
-That's all we know.
-That doesn't sound like you're concerned.

22:46.230 --> 22:47.731
I think that's a pretty big deal.

22:48.650 --> 22:50.652
What if he's killing these animals, too?

22:51.570 --> 22:53.652
Okay, that would be...
That would be very different.

22:53.740 --> 22:57.198
Exactly, that'd be very different.
It would be a thing, Wendy.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.742
A thing we'd potentially have
to deal with the rest of our lives.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.878
I don't think we need to go there,
all right?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.120
-Why not?
-Not yet.

23:04.210 --> 23:07.338
Why not? Because he's a sweet,
gentle little boy.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.876
-Quiet, please. Quiet.
-He makes his mother Mother's Day cards

23:08.970 --> 23:09.959
out of construction paper.

23:10.050 --> 23:11.790
I know he's a sweet boy, but he's a...

23:11.890 --> 23:14.131
He can be a bit strange at times,
can he not?

23:14.220 --> 23:16.882
You can admit that, right?
Every once in a while?

23:18.270 --> 23:19.430
Oh, my God.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.556
What?

23:23.060 --> 23:23.936
What?

23:24.440 --> 23:26.180
- The Langmores.
- What about them?

23:26.270 --> 23:29.444
I thought they were the ones
with the dead animals.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.657
So I went over there
and I threw a possum on their roof.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.776
They're gonna think I'm fucking insane.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.862
- You what?
- It's this place, Marty.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.862
- You threw a possum?
- No, it's this place. It's this place!

23:40.500 --> 23:44.129
Ijust... Ijust don't know if this is
any kind of place to raise a kid, any kid.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.627
Especially if...

23:51.840 --> 23:53.000
If what?

23:53.970 --> 23:55.631
What if it's genetic?

23:57.640 --> 24:00.382
-It's not that. _
-No, you know my brother's history.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.880
Wendy, there's no way it's that.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.891
This is a... a normal kid

24:04.980 --> 24:07.813
that is having some sort of
adolescent death fixation.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.390
That's... that's normal.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.390
Yeah, but what if he's that...

24:12.030 --> 24:14.351
you know, that strange,
beautiful kid who...

24:14.450 --> 24:16.771
one day goes and shoots up a high school?

24:18.580 --> 24:19.990
What then?

24:26.290 --> 24:29.919
No, I, uh...
I grew up coming here with my dad.

24:30.010 --> 24:33.628
Just summers, from Chicago.
But my mom hated it, though.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.291
-Uh-huh. You got boats?
-Mm.

24:37.260 --> 24:41.094
Uh, not anymore.
I'm more of a fly fisherman now.

24:42.020 --> 24:44.727
-You know any anglers around here?
-There's a few. Not many.

24:44.810 --> 24:46.266
Well, if you know someone,

24:46.350 --> 24:49.934
I'd be willing to pay them to show me
spots where the water really moves, so...

24:50.860 --> 24:52.646
How much you talking?

24:55.280 --> 24:57.407
Uh... hundred bucks?

24:59.030 --> 25:00.236
Robert Powell.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.286
Russ Langmore.

25:03.290 --> 25:05.611
-Good to meet you.
-Oh, the pleasure's mine.

25:16.930 --> 25:18.329
Am I in trouble?

25:18.430 --> 25:21.422
No, it's not about
being in trouble, sweetie.

25:21.510 --> 25:24.343
No, you're not in trouble.
Not at all. Um...

25:24.430 --> 25:26.432
'Cause I didn't mean to do
anything wrong or anything.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.932
I know. We just wanna talk to you
about what's going on, you know.

25:29.020 --> 25:33.275
Everyone's running in every
different direction. It's, uh, you know...

25:33.360 --> 25:34.896
There's a lot... there's a lot going on.

25:34.990 --> 25:38.619
And, uh... things can... It can be...

25:39.580 --> 25:41.525
-Strange.
-Yep.

25:41.620 --> 25:45.533
And, um... it's a big adjustment,
especially when you go to a town

25:45.620 --> 25:47.451
where you don't know anybody
except your own family.

25:47.540 --> 25:50.919
It can be lonely. So... um...

25:53.920 --> 25:56.127
Jonah, did you kill those animals?

25:58.890 --> 26:00.005
What?

26:01.970 --> 26:03.096
Are you kidding?

26:03.180 --> 26:05.091
- Concerned, more like it.
- I love animals.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.592
I know.
That's why it seemed so strange.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.603
Did you know that turkey vultures
have a wingspan of over six feet?

26:12.820 --> 26:14.731
They feed on dead animals.

26:14.820 --> 26:19.154
The carcasses give off a chemical that
the vultures can smell over a mile away.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.946
Jonah, are you saying...

26:21.030 --> 26:25.239
that you're dragging dead animals here
to the house so you can study vultures?

26:25.910 --> 26:28.287
Yeah, if you cut their bellies
a little bit...

26:28.370 --> 26:32.579
the vultures will come swooping down
at, like, 35 miles an hour.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.793
I was really careful
to wash my hands afterwards.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.177
Oh, good.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.711
I was trying to tell you before
about that...

26:44.810 --> 26:47.802
that great big house on Sunrise Beach
on Mile 18?

26:47.890 --> 26:49.187
It's not the time to talk about this.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.397
No, but... I mean,
it's half-built and it's rotting,

26:51.480 --> 26:53.892
-but can't you move money--
-It's not the time to talk about this.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.311
-Oh, come on!
-I've had a long day

26:55.400 --> 26:58.312
-and I'm late for something.
-It's a good idea!

27:00.610 --> 27:02.237
I know it. You know it.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.497
-Got that two grand?
-Yeah, what's it for?

27:09.580 --> 27:12.208
You don't want to know, Martin.
Extraneous shit.

27:13.670 --> 27:14.876
All right.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.647
What the fuck are you doing?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.100
You're clear what we talked about?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.738
- Don't worry. We got this.
- Smoking stunts your growth.

27:46.030 --> 27:50.148
All right, listen, motherfuckers.
If you deviate from the plan,

27:50.250 --> 27:53.913
I'll take a dull fucking blade
and cut y'all.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.538
Ahh, ahh

28:31.290 --> 28:34.327
Well, I suffer long

28:34.420 --> 28:36.661
Through ill and woe

28:37.380 --> 28:40.417
Done so many wrong

28:40.510 --> 28:42.831
I don't even know

28:44.090 --> 28:46.422
'Cause I can't change...

28:54.190 --> 28:57.307
Report of shots fired
at Lickety Splitz Night Club.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.686
All units proceed with caution.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.326
Turn the music off!

29:16.420 --> 29:19.492
Get off the stage!
Ma'am, get off the stage!

29:19.590 --> 29:21.911
Shots fired? What the fuck?

29:22.010 --> 29:25.173
Who the hell said shots fired?
There were no goddamn shots fired.

29:25.260 --> 29:28.138
I wanna see a fucking warrant.
Where the fuck are you going?

29:28.220 --> 29:29.630
--What? What is this?

29:29.720 --> 29:32.598
Everybody, up. Back. Shut the fuck up.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.516
Jesus. How old are you, son?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.431
All right, let's see some IDs.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.611
I want my fucking lawyer.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.783
Somebody call my lawyer right fucking now.

30:01.210 --> 30:03.041
Hey, what happened? Are you crazy?

30:03.130 --> 30:05.758
I'm in here with the safe,
but I can't get it open.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.659
Why not?

30:06.760 --> 30:11.094
You really wanna know the ins and outs
of a fucking Trako 5700 floor safe?

30:11.180 --> 30:14.092
No, I don't. I want you to break
into the safe and get me what's inside.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.920
I can't. I just... I gotta get out.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.009
Wait a second.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.852
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.317
-How big is that safe?
-I don't know.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.890
Like the size of a microwave?

30:24.980 --> 30:27.357
Go around to the back door
and meet me there in five minutes.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.350
-No, I can't. I--
-Just go.

30:29.450 --> 30:31.657
Five minutes. Wait for me.
I'll be right there.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.832
I mean,
did you even have a fucking plan?

30:44.920 --> 30:49.289
A stethoscope or a bobby pin at least?
Jesus Christ.

31:15.870 --> 31:18.441
What the fuck did you trick me into?

31:19.290 --> 31:21.451
25% of some worthless shit?

31:22.290 --> 31:23.996
Can you just shine the light
down here, please?

31:29.220 --> 31:32.678
If I get popped for this,
I'll be sent away for years.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.000
For what?

31:34.930 --> 31:36.966
-Did you hear me?
-Just shine the fucking light.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.381
-Give me the light.
-Stupid ass.

31:50.030 --> 31:50.985
Oh, hang on.

31:56.740 --> 31:57.729
This is good.

31:58.830 --> 32:01.037
This is... This is good.

32:02.870 --> 32:03.996
What is it?

32:06.170 --> 32:07.410
This is good.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.296
That's very good.

32:14.050 --> 32:17.008
So I get to this
beautiful running stream.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.729
Just thick with grayling, trout,
smooth bottom.

32:20.810 --> 32:23.722
- Perfect water. Just cold as tits, right?
- Uh-huh.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.681
So I open my fly box.

32:27.650 --> 32:29.186
It's not my fly box.

32:30.110 --> 32:32.487
And it's empty.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.156
What'd you do?

32:37.240 --> 32:40.368
Okay, so, what, it's early morning,
it's early June.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.111
I improvised. I lean down.

32:43.210 --> 32:47.533
I'm wearing these socks, right?
Black socks with a red stripe.

32:47.630 --> 32:49.916
So I start pulling on these socks.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.161
I get about a foot of the thread,
little bit of the red

32:53.260 --> 32:55.330
and then I start wrapping it
around the hook.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.928
And when I'm done,
I have this thing, it looks like...

33:01.430 --> 33:05.014
It looks like a bloody fucking spider
that somebody stomped on or something.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.647
--But I figure, "What the fuck."

33:07.230 --> 33:08.185
And?

33:08.940 --> 33:11.067
Eight big browns, 12 rainbows,

33:11.150 --> 33:12.481
- in less than two hours.

33:12.570 --> 33:13.855
Shit you not.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.736
Ah, no such luck today.

33:17.740 --> 33:20.482
- We missed the hatch.
- Well, no worries.

33:20.580 --> 33:23.367
It's just so good to be
outside the city, you know.

33:23.450 --> 33:24.451
St. Louis?

33:25.460 --> 33:26.449
Chicago.

33:28.290 --> 33:29.666
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

33:30.590 --> 33:32.160
What do you do in Chicago?

33:32.760 --> 33:34.079
Retired Marine.

33:35.010 --> 33:38.719
I got my pension before I got shot.
Hallelujah.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.304
My old man wanted to be a Marine,
but he was too much of a pussy.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.972
He ended up Navy.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.550
Always complaining.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.260
Took it out on us.

33:52.570 --> 33:54.140
He fucking hated the service.

33:55.070 --> 33:56.890
Yeah, so did I.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.117
I don't like being tied down, you know?

34:01.030 --> 34:02.440
It's suffocating.

34:03.370 --> 34:07.249
And I just got out of a relationship
with a freaking lunatic.

34:07.330 --> 34:08.866
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

34:09.790 --> 34:14.796
So, compared to that,
not catching any fish is fucking paradise.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.210
So, your ex...

34:23.060 --> 34:24.800
She hot at least?

34:26.140 --> 34:27.129
Not she.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.049
He.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.602
Don't worry.
I only fuck guys that wanna get fucked.

34:44.620 --> 34:45.996
There you go.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.663
Good morning.
How did everybody sleep?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.160
- Hey.
- Oh, thanks.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.285
Mm-hmm.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.586
How'd you guys sleep, huh?

34:54.670 --> 34:58.128
I slept very, very well. Look at this.

34:58.220 --> 34:59.460
Great, thank you.

35:01.010 --> 35:03.922
Everybody, okay? Charlotte, you all right?

35:07.060 --> 35:09.517
You do know that sound carries
across water, don't you?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.509
What does that mean?

35:14.570 --> 35:16.891
It's not enough that you're criminals,
but you gave us one chance,

35:16.980 --> 35:18.481
-a couple weeks ago...
-We're not criminals.

35:18.570 --> 35:21.027
-...to ask about the shit that went down.
-What are you talking about?

35:21.110 --> 35:23.487
And you threw a dead animal
at somebody's house?

35:25.740 --> 35:27.947
Hey, that was supposed to be
a private conversation.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.167
You used to say,
"Do whatever you're gonna do,

35:30.250 --> 35:32.536
as long as you're honest about it," right?

35:33.460 --> 35:35.542
But are either of you honest? Ever?

35:36.960 --> 35:38.951
When outright lies
aren't spilling out of your mouths,

35:39.050 --> 35:40.119
you're eating fucking pancakes,

35:40.220 --> 35:41.835
-pretending everything's fine...
-That's enough.

35:41.930 --> 35:45.843
...when, really, last night you said
you think Jonah might shoot up a school?

35:49.270 --> 35:51.682
-We were very concerned.
-Very worried.

35:51.770 --> 35:54.011
-Jonah had an explanation--
-Did you say it or not?

35:54.100 --> 35:57.319
-Just tell the truth.
-You think I'd shoot up a school?

35:58.280 --> 36:00.350
-No, come on. Of course not.
-No, sweetheart. It's just--

36:00.450 --> 36:02.520
Something you said. Right.

36:04.950 --> 36:06.520
Who said it? You or dad?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.119
You think I'm weird, don't you?

36:23.220 --> 36:24.881
-No. No.
-No, I don't.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.635
Why should I believe anything you say

36:27.720 --> 36:30.052
when you've been lying to me
my entire life?

36:42.450 --> 36:46.409
I know. I'm grounded, no phone,
no social media, no driver's license.

36:46.490 --> 36:49.323
-I get it, okay?
-No. Actually...

36:50.750 --> 36:51.739
you're right.

37:29.530 --> 37:30.781
Wendy!

37:33.080 --> 37:33.899
Wendy!

37:35.040 --> 37:37.747
No, it's really small.
It reminds me of my hometown.

37:37.830 --> 37:40.242
There is a complete lack of decent pizza.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.963
The best coffee is, get this...
It's at the Piggly Wiggly.

37:46.930 --> 37:50.388
And everyone here is a Cards fan.
And Jesus, it is hot.

37:50.970 --> 37:53.427
God Almighty, it is hot.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.090
It's not even July yet.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.262
And it's... it's really quiet.

37:58.350 --> 37:59.601
Which...

37:59.690 --> 38:03.182
you know, can either be very calming
or it can drive you batshit crazy.

38:05.190 --> 38:07.408
Anyway... I...

38:09.410 --> 38:11.867
I... I know this is insane...

38:13.330 --> 38:16.117
but I just don't know who else to talk to.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.667
And honestly,
I just wanted to hear your voice.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.460
Bye.

38:43.860 --> 38:45.316
Thank you.

38:52.950 --> 38:55.498
The fuck are you doing here?

38:56.410 --> 38:58.492
I've come to buy your strip club.

38:58.580 --> 39:00.241
Your titty bar.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.332
And they let you in, why?

39:03.420 --> 39:05.832
Because I offered to post your ball.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.504
It was steep, too, with the pandering
and endangering a minor,

39:09.590 --> 39:11.251
not once, but ﬁve times.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.592
Um...

39:14.720 --> 39:20.306
I think a fair price for the club
is $200,000.

39:23.690 --> 39:26.102
And you think
you can steal my fucking club

39:26.190 --> 39:28.602
by getting me tossed in jail?

39:28.690 --> 39:31.022
I'm not stealing. I'm buying.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.361
I ain't selling.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.418
Guard!

39:41.330 --> 39:43.036
I'm done here.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.293
Let me ask you a question.
When you went to post your own bail,

39:46.380 --> 39:49.338
and you noticed that
your accounts were offline...

39:51.260 --> 39:53.046
did you stop to wonder why?

39:58.770 --> 40:00.055
Never mind.

40:06.730 --> 40:10.234
Yeah, I don't think you're aware,
but a few weeks ago I was in your club

40:10.320 --> 40:12.197
and I was talking to a few people
that you employ

40:12.280 --> 40:15.272
_and I found out
that you like to vacation in Panama.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.569
I thought, "Why Panama? Why not
Mexico or Belize?"

40:20.660 --> 40:22.867
Unless it had something
to do with the fact

40:22.960 --> 40:26.202
that Panama is a hub for money laundering.

40:27.130 --> 40:28.791
I want my fucking lawyer!

40:30.260 --> 40:32.160
You want the Panamanian lawyer?

40:32.260 --> 40:33.921
The one that sets up the shell companies

40:34.010 --> 40:36.001
for you to launder your money
through your club?

40:37.720 --> 40:43.260
I mean, what are the odds that we've both
done considerable time in Panama?

40:43.350 --> 40:46.979
That's, like... What was it?
That's three to one, at least.

40:48.190 --> 40:49.646
What are the odds that we both recognize

40:49.730 --> 40:51.891
the value of the legal community
in that country?

40:52.900 --> 40:54.652
It's five to one, I'll bet you.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.521
But what are the odds that we would

40:57.620 --> 41:01.078
both be drawn to the work
of the contracts lawyers

41:01.160 --> 41:04.209
at the law firm of Machado Philipo?

41:06.080 --> 41:08.662
Those odds are very long.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.789
Yeah?

41:16.510 --> 41:19.718
-I ain't fucking talking to you.
-It's okay. You can just listen.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.926
'Cause I'm just...
I'm thinking out loud about...

41:23.100 --> 41:26.888
...how shell companies work, you know.
The... the miracle, really,

41:26.980 --> 41:29.858
that makes it possible
to move money around

41:29.940 --> 41:32.738
without countries being able to track it.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.811
Uh, I'm just... I'm fascinated by it.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.153
What has me thoroughly taken

41:38.240 --> 41:42.404
is how a man can own
and operate a company...

41:43.080 --> 41:44.820
without ever putting his name on it,

41:44.910 --> 41:49.415
so that every move, every transaction,
is perfectly undetectable.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.798
Think about that. How's that possible?

41:52.880 --> 41:55.257
How, if you never put
your name on a company,

41:55.340 --> 41:57.251
do you ever even own the company?

41:58.260 --> 42:00.672
I don't get it. I mean,
it's something to ponder, isn't it?

42:00.760 --> 42:05.129
I mean, that guy would have to be
in possession, physical possession,

42:05.230 --> 42:09.052
of that company's bearer shares.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.139
Yeah?

42:12.780 --> 42:16.693
The piece of paper?
The deed to his empire?

42:16.780 --> 42:19.192
It would all come down to that,
wouldn't it?

42:21.330 --> 42:25.073
And if he was in possession
of that piece of paper...

42:25.870 --> 42:27.701
where do you think he'd keep it?

42:30.460 --> 42:32.280
You think he'd put it in a safe?

42:35.170 --> 42:36.751
In a manila envelope...

42:38.880 --> 42:42.293
in the false bottom of that safe?

42:46.140 --> 42:48.847
Now, I don't go to church
and I don't consider myself a Christian.

42:48.940 --> 42:51.852
I don't consider myself anything,
but I do like to think

42:51.940 --> 42:53.931
that I follow a certain code.

42:54.020 --> 43:00.482
So, even though I now am in possession
of that little piece of paper...

43:02.030 --> 43:06.069
I'm not gonna take your club.
I'm gonna buy it.

43:07.250 --> 43:08.615
And as I said...

43:09.870 --> 43:12.703
I'm able to make you a very fair offer.

43:13.380 --> 43:14.369
So...

43:18.010 --> 43:19.625
One seventy-five?

43:25.510 --> 43:29.685
So, I... I know that a lot of you
have been through a lot, and...

43:29.770 --> 43:31.146
and I appreciate your patience.

43:31.230 --> 43:35.724
I... I won't take much of your time.
I just wanted to simply introduce myself.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.890
My name is...
is Marty Byrde and, as of now,

43:37.990 --> 43:43.110
I'm the proud owner
of this gentlemen's club.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.579
Uh, I'm not gonna stand up here
and disparage your former boss.

43:46.660 --> 43:48.946
You all know that this club
was breaking laws.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.325
Uh, the one thing that I...

43:50.410 --> 43:53.208
that I wanna say,
I wanna make crystal clear is that,

43:53.290 --> 43:55.281
you know, you all have rights.

43:56.210 --> 43:58.838
You have the right to self-esteem.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.751
- That's right.
- The right to self-respect.

44:00.840 --> 44:02.546
Not to mention
the respect of the customers,

44:02.640 --> 44:05.461
the respect of the employers,
myself included.

44:05.550 --> 44:07.711
- Yeah._
- Yeah? I'm just...

44:07.810 --> 44:10.597
I'm happy to say that, uh,
things are changing around here.

44:10.690 --> 44:11.839
All for the better.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.589
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, in short...

44:14.150 --> 44:17.642
none of you are... are ever gonna
have to give another blowjob again.

44:21.570 --> 44:24.232
How the hell do you expect us
to make a living then?

44:24.870 --> 44:26.326
Mm-hmm.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.702
-Here's fine. _
-No, no, no. I can pull up your driveway.

44:35.790 --> 44:37.246
I've got plenty of gas.

44:38.500 --> 44:41.628
So, uh, how about tomorrow?

44:42.220 --> 44:43.426
I'm busy tomorrow.

44:43.510 --> 44:46.718
Okay. Well, how about the day after that?

44:47.680 --> 44:50.171
-I gotta check. Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.010
Whoa.

44:55.650 --> 44:57.891
What in the hell is that?

44:58.610 --> 44:59.929
Bobcats. Uh...

45:00.530 --> 45:02.737
Whoa. Whoa.

45:04.610 --> 45:07.443
Hey. I'm Robert.

45:09.990 --> 45:13.118
-Ruth.
-Oh, don't you work at the Blue Cat?

45:13.210 --> 45:15.997
I thought I saw you there. Hey, man.

45:20.130 --> 45:22.507
Hey, think about the day after tomorrow.

45:23.420 --> 45:26.082
I mean, if it's about money,
I can pay you more.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.711
Like I said, I... I gotta check.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.342
Okay. See you.

45:34.430 --> 45:36.341
- Check what?

45:36.440 --> 45:39.011
- Turning down money ain't like you.

45:43.860 --> 45:45.771
Why you turning down money?
Money for what?

45:45.860 --> 45:48.818
Shut up, Boyd. He's a fucking fag.

45:55.870 --> 45:58.873
Okay. Here's your seven grand.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.667
That's 25% of last night's take
at the club.

46:01.750 --> 46:05.299
-Beats washing dishes, huh?
-Don't act like this is a fucking gift.

46:06.220 --> 46:10.008
You ever say, "Thank you"?
Those words? In your life?

46:11.010 --> 46:12.420
I fucking earned this.

46:13.890 --> 46:15.517
I'll take that as a no.

46:16.980 --> 46:18.971
--Thank you.

46:22.650 --> 46:26.108
-I see a man who could use a beer.
-Ugh. You see correctly.

46:27.030 --> 46:29.487
Uh, I've got some good news
and some bad news.

46:29.570 --> 46:31.697
Um... start with the good news.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.192
Uh, I have invested in another business,

46:34.290 --> 46:36.861
so I'm gonna be out of your hair
for a little bit.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.201
And, um... the bad news is that, uh...

46:39.290 --> 46:41.338
I'm gonna be back here,
uh, in a little bit

46:41.420 --> 46:44.912
to watch the game, after which
you'll likely be 50 bucks lighter.

46:45.920 --> 46:50.254
Well, unfortunately,
during game time, I will be elsewhere.

46:50.340 --> 46:53.218
A little local tradition.

46:53.310 --> 46:56.347
Sunday night,
while we're watching the game of the week,

46:56.430 --> 46:57.727
she's getting her fuck of the week.

47:00.480 --> 47:04.018
Sunday nights I go down to the Rusty Hull
and drink some tequila.

47:04.110 --> 47:07.022
And then, around ten o'clock,
Minnie Riperton comes on that jukebox.

47:07.570 --> 47:09.640
Some young local thing
gets me to slow dance.

47:09.740 --> 47:12.117
Four out of five, he's gonna slip his hand
down the back of my jeans.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.077
And if he is cute...

47:14.160 --> 47:15.366
I'll let him.

47:18.790 --> 47:19.609
Oh, hey.

47:19.710 --> 47:21.917
-Hey.
-What'll you have?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.628
- I'll have a Miller Lite.
- Um, okay.

47:26.170 --> 47:27.706
...two, three, go!

47:27.800 --> 47:29.540
One, two, three, go!

47:29.630 --> 47:30.870
Ha! Ha!

47:32.510 --> 47:34.091
Okay. One, two, three...

47:44.440 --> 47:47.398
- One, two, three, go!
- Yep. Told ya...

48:08.710 --> 48:09.870
Ha! Gotcha!

48:11.050 --> 48:12.711
One, two, three, go!

48:23.310 --> 48:25.801
Hi, it's Gary Silverberg.

48:25.900 --> 48:29.028
Please leave a detailed message
after the beep.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.146
I've been trying
to tell you since yesterday

49:06.230 --> 49:09.142
about that half-built house
on Sunrise Beach.

49:09.230 --> 49:11.312
Mm-hmm. What about it?

49:12.320 --> 49:15.198
Well, I used the money
from the Chicago house and I bought it.

49:16.450 --> 49:19.863
Now, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure
you can inflate construction costs

49:19.950 --> 49:21.076
and launder money through it.

49:21.660 --> 49:24.663
And quite frankly,
I don't give a shit if you like it or not.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.490
'Cause I feel pretty good about it.

49:27.460 --> 49:30.952
It's a good idea,
and I did it for our family.

49:32.130 --> 49:33.620
What'd you do today...

49:34.800 --> 49:36.210
for our family?

49:43.810 --> 49:45.380
Bought a strip club.

49:55.150 --> 49:57.527
- Name.
- Bobby Dean for Jacob.

50:37.700 --> 50:38.519
Darlene?

50:39.160 --> 50:42.778
Could we have a couple of glasses, please?
Some lemonade? Thank you.

50:58.630 --> 50:59.870
Hello?

50:59.970 --> 51:03.133
It says, "Wendy" on my father's phone.

51:03.220 --> 51:06.553
I think you knew him.
I... I'm sure you did.

51:07.270 --> 51:09.181
We all have lots of questions
about his death,

51:09.270 --> 51:11.511
and I was wondering
if you maybe had any information.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.197
How'd they treat you down there?

51:19.150 --> 51:20.606
Oh, you know...

51:21.530 --> 51:23.066
You speak to Sheriff Nix?

51:23.990 --> 51:26.823
-My lawyer did.
-What'd he say?

51:28.330 --> 51:30.241
What lawyers say, I guess.

51:33.210 --> 51:34.279
This Marty Byrde...

51:36.550 --> 51:41.499
-I don't know what to tell you about him.
-Financial planner. Comes from Chicago.

51:41.590 --> 51:43.342
Appears in Lake Ozark.

51:44.930 --> 51:47.637
Sounds like something
from a newspaper headline.

51:50.060 --> 51:51.300
I'll work it out.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.936
What else do you know about him?

51:57.030 --> 51:58.850
Besides he washes money?

52:01.570 --> 52:05.199
How'd he come to know
that's what you were doing?

52:07.370 --> 52:09.827
- That's just it. I--
- Sprung a leak?

52:11.710 --> 52:13.701
I mean, but... who?

52:15.380 --> 52:16.916
That's what I'm asking.

52:20.670 --> 52:21.921
Darlene!

52:22.880 --> 52:24.586
More lemonade, please.

52:30.310 --> 52:34.428
Redneck and a hillbilly
are strolling along a country lane,

52:34.520 --> 52:36.568
talking about the Garden of Eden.

52:37.320 --> 52:41.233
The redneck,
drinking whiskey as he walks...

52:43.030 --> 52:46.579
believes that Adam and Eve
had every right to take that apple...

52:47.910 --> 52:50.902
for, if God were kind...

52:52.080 --> 52:56.164
why would he forbid them
from partaking in that delicious fruit?

52:57.460 --> 53:00.702
The hillbilly listens and nods.

53:01.920 --> 53:06.710
Then the redneck finishes the bottle
and throws it onto the path.

53:08.260 --> 53:10.137
When the hillbilly frowns...

53:11.100 --> 53:15.548
the redneck says,
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

53:17.480 --> 53:19.937
When the hillbilly frowns again,

53:20.020 --> 53:24.605
redneck says,
"You judge doubly, you sin twice."

53:26.240 --> 53:30.654
Whereupon God smites the redneck dead.

53:34.620 --> 53:35.780
Hillbilly...

53:37.170 --> 53:39.377
forever silent and diligent...

53:40.050 --> 53:42.086
digs the redneck's grave...

53:42.670 --> 53:46.174
fashions a humble tombstone
from the empty bottle,

53:46.260 --> 53:47.545
and walks on.

53:49.510 --> 53:50.499
That eve...

53:51.560 --> 53:56.975
he witnesses the most beautiful sunset
ever 'fore made.

54:05.190 --> 54:06.691
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh.

54:06.780 --> 54:09.908
- Oh, Jesus. Oh... I... I...
- Lord, I am sorry.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.031
Fucking redneck.

55:12.890 --> 55:15.768
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to be in bed.

55:20.600 --> 55:21.976
Is this how you do it?

55:22.770 --> 55:24.067
It's part of it.

55:29.070 --> 55:30.651
Could you explain all of it?

55:37.540 --> 55:38.780
Okay.

55:39.910 --> 55:42.993
Money Laundering 101.
Let's start with this.

55:44.210 --> 55:47.702
Let's say you come across a suitcase
with five million bucks in it.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.960
What would you buy?

55:50.550 --> 55:53.383
A sports car? A yacht? A mansion?

55:55.010 --> 55:57.672
Well, too bad, the IRS won't let you buy
anything of value...

55:57.770 --> 56:01.012
-- Yeah, you got satin shoes

56:04.110 --> 56:07.568
Yeah, you got plastic boots

56:10.530 --> 56:13.818
Y'all got cocaine eyes

56:16.950 --> 56:20.659
Yeah, you got speed-freak jive, now

56:21.920 --> 56:25.458
Can't you hear me knockin'
On your window

56:28.050 --> 56:32.999
Can't you hear me knockin'
On your door

56:34.720 --> 56:39.510
Can't you hear me knockin'
Down your dirty street

56:40.850 --> 56:42.090
Yeah

56:44.190 --> 56:46.260
Help me, baby

56:46.860 --> 56:48.771
Ain't no stranger

56:50.280 --> 56:52.236
Help me, baby

56:53.490 --> 56:55.776
Ain't no stranger

56:56.870 --> 56:58.781
Help me, baby

56:59.870 --> 57:01.997
Ain't no stranger

57:04.870 --> 57:06.781
Can't you hear me knockin'

57:07.790 --> 57:09.951
Are you safe asleep?

57:11.260 --> 57:12.796
Can't you hear me knockin'

57:13.340 --> 57:16.798
Yeah, down the gaslight street, now

57:17.510 --> 57:18.807
Can't you hear me knockin'

57:18.890 --> 57:22.178
Yeah, throw me down the keys

57:22.890 --> 57:24.266
All right, now

57:26.900 --> 57:32.179
Hear me ringing
Big bell tolls

57:33.570 --> 57:38.189
Hear me singing soft and low

57:39.620 --> 57:44.819
I've been begging on my knees

57:46.170 --> 57:51.449
I've been kickin'
Help me, please

57:52.380 --> 57:54.837
Hear me prowlin'

57:54.920 --> 57:58.708
I'm gonna take you down

57:58.800 --> 58:00.848
Hear me growlin'

58:00.930 --> 58:05.378
Yeah, I've got flatted feet
Now, now, now, now

58:05.480 --> 58:08.017
- Hear me howlin'
- And all

58:08.100 --> 58:11.228
I'm all around your street now

58:11.400 --> 58:14.528
