<i>Previously, on Between...</i>

00:02.174 --> 00:05.672
<i>We are putting Pretty Lake
under full quarantine.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:10.434
<i>In the meantime, our military will
use whatever force necessary on anyone</i>

00:10.435 --> 00:13.063
trying to enter
or leave the area.

00:13.393 --> 00:16.276
They're leaving you people to die
before you infect the rest of us.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.599
You know what,
your brother is one sick...

00:20.104 --> 00:21.261
Watch out!

00:23.201 --> 00:25.413
- She's dead.
- We need to leave.

00:25.414 --> 00:26.098
I'm sorry.

00:26.099 --> 00:27.778
You remind me your father.

00:28.136 --> 00:29.523
We are nothing alike.

00:29.524 --> 00:32.961
I apologize for the late hour, but
you have something that belongs to me.

00:32.962 --> 00:35.206
I'm here for my wife, Hanna.

00:37.259 --> 00:38.642
I'm so sorry.

00:40.469 --> 00:42.573
<i>So besides this kid, Adam,</i>

00:42.574 --> 00:45.208
<i>there appears to be no one else
investigating what happened?</i>

00:45.209 --> 00:46.356
No.

00:47.135 --> 00:48.959
What do you know
about Art Carey?

00:49.266 --> 00:51.392
<i>I found a canister on his body.</i>

00:51.592 --> 00:53.088
I think it might be
involved in the deaths.

00:56.438 --> 00:57.539
Please.

01:01.920 --> 01:02.862
Adam...

01:03.420 --> 01:04.471

Adam.

01:16.513 --> 01:18.348
Adam, come on.

01:18.431 --> 01:19.474
Hey, wake up.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.018
Wake up. Come on.
Come on.

01:22.101 --> 01:24.729
She hit you pretty hard.
I think you passed out.

01:24.812 --> 01:27.690
I let you sleep as long as I could,
but we gotta move. Come on.

01:28.941 --> 01:30.277
Hey, wait.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.944
What the hell is going on?

01:32.028 --> 01:33.696
We don't have time, okay?
Let's go.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.072
Come on.

01:36.408 --> 01:37.575
Here.

01:37.659 --> 01:38.660
Go where?

01:38.743 --> 01:41.413
I can get us out of here.

01:41.496 --> 01:43.373
How?

01:43.456 --> 01:44.666
There is no way out.

01:44.749 --> 01:46.709
How do you think I got in?

01:46.793 --> 01:48.169
Come on.

Watch out!

02:07.263 --> 02:08.931
Amanda! Help me!

02:09.014 --> 02:11.015
She just ran into the road.
I didn't see her.

02:11.017 --> 02:12.727
- Yeah, I know.
- Where'd she come from?

02:12.810 --> 02:14.646
- She didn't see the car?
- Amanda, come on!

02:14.729 --> 02:16.856
She's dead.

02:16.939 --> 02:19.651
- What are we gonna do?
- We have to leave.

02:37.710 --> 02:39.378
What'd you find out?

02:40.296 --> 02:42.048
No one knows anything for sure.

02:42.715 --> 02:43.925
But?

02:44.008 --> 02:45.510
The pharmacy was broken into.

02:45.593 --> 02:47.386
The meds are missing.

02:49.305 --> 02:50.306
Creekers.

02:51.473 --> 02:53.017
Looks that way.

02:54.644 --> 02:56.228
You don't just...

02:56.312 --> 02:58.113
leave somebody in the street
to die like that.

02:58.147 --> 03:00.608
You stay.
You stay with her. You...

03:07.782 --> 03:09.491
Round up the boys.

03:09.576 --> 03:11.911
Tell 'em to meet back here
as soon as you can.

03:11.994 --> 03:13.746
Everybody comes armed.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.836
Wait, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

03:19.919 --> 03:21.003
Yep.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.562
You're up early.

03:37.645 --> 03:40.272
The cows needed to be milked.

03:40.982 --> 03:42.524
I'm sorry.

03:42.609 --> 03:44.249
You don't need to apologize for anything.

03:44.276 --> 03:46.821
Please, can you at least look at me?

03:51.909 --> 03:54.286
You could've told me you were married.

03:55.747 --> 03:56.956
Well, if you want an excuse,

03:57.039 --> 04:00.877
I couldn't think of anything
that didn't sound completely weird.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.632
I also... didn't expect to find myself
having feelings for someone so soon.

04:07.049 --> 04:08.050
Do you love him?

04:11.012 --> 04:13.264
The marriage is what
the community wanted.

04:14.181 --> 04:17.309
Instead of putting a stop to it,
I just...

04:17.392 --> 04:21.814
went along with it until...
I was married... was a wife.

04:22.606 --> 04:23.607
So then why go back?

04:23.691 --> 04:25.943
Because they need me.

04:26.485 --> 04:30.572
Because I can run away from John,
but I can't run away from my community.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.118
Well, then you better be getting back.

04:43.878 --> 04:47.214
Let me go back before they figure it out
and try to explain this to Chuck.

04:47.298 --> 04:49.926
Yeah, and then
he'll know it was Pat for sure.

04:50.009 --> 04:52.887
Yeah, but maybe I can make him
understand that it was an accident.

04:53.888 --> 04:57.141
And what scenario do you think
ends up with him understanding?

04:57.224 --> 04:59.811
If that happened to me, Pat or Ronnie,

04:59.894 --> 05:02.647
I wouldn't be much in the mood
for talking it out.

05:04.190 --> 05:05.191
Pat's gone.

05:12.865 --> 05:15.159
Is Chuck okay?

05:15.242 --> 05:16.368
Yeah.

05:19.496 --> 05:21.082
Any ideas who it was?

05:21.165 --> 05:23.250
The Creekers.

05:24.376 --> 05:27.546
Look, everyone knows
that your sister's with them.

05:28.380 --> 05:31.050
You realize she has a target
on her back as well, right?

05:31.133 --> 05:32.426
Yeah.

05:32.509 --> 05:36.263
Is there any way that you can
get to her and talk to her?

05:38.265 --> 05:42.103
She's never listened to me before.
She's not gonna start now.

05:53.030 --> 05:55.199
They don't have anyone keeping guard.

05:55.282 --> 05:57.034
No one in the woods either.

05:57.118 --> 05:59.203
They don't know we're coming.

05:59.286 --> 06:01.622
Maybe they didn't do it...

06:01.706 --> 06:03.499
or they know and it's a trap.

06:03.582 --> 06:05.584
There's only one way to find out.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.919
Come on.

06:32.236 --> 06:35.489
- Uh, is... is Chuck home?
- No.

06:36.824 --> 06:38.534
You expecting him back any time soon?

06:38.617 --> 06:40.202
Yeah.

06:42.789 --> 06:44.623
No, sorry, uh...

06:44.706 --> 06:46.167
No, I don't think so.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.585
Why? What's up?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.797
I killed Amanda.

06:57.594 --> 07:00.973
The house being empty
doesn't prove they didn't do it.

07:02.099 --> 07:04.101
You're gonna want to see this.

07:12.151 --> 07:13.986
You think this was here yesterday?

07:14.904 --> 07:17.156
No. You?

07:18.449 --> 07:19.992
No...

07:20.076 --> 07:21.869
definitely not.

07:26.916 --> 07:28.459
Milk's ready.

07:28.542 --> 07:31.337
If you're not going into town, I'll do it.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.505
You need to stay here.

07:34.548 --> 07:35.757
We both do.

07:35.842 --> 07:37.259
What about Melissa's kids?

07:37.343 --> 07:39.846
They need the milk.

07:39.929 --> 07:41.848
You ever wonder why he did it?

07:41.931 --> 07:43.891
Did what?

07:44.683 --> 07:46.060
You know.

07:48.980 --> 07:50.314
Every day.

07:51.398 --> 07:52.649
You?

07:53.734 --> 07:56.820
I keep asking myself...

07:56.904 --> 07:58.447
was it 'cause of the virus...

08:01.158 --> 08:02.784
or was the virus just an excuse?

08:02.869 --> 08:06.538
You're not thinking of doing
the same thing, are you, Gord?

08:09.666 --> 08:11.377
No.

08:11.961 --> 08:14.005
I couldn't do that to you.

08:14.964 --> 08:16.465
Then drive me into town.

08:22.263 --> 08:24.390
Okay.

08:38.404 --> 08:40.530
It was the Creekers.

08:40.614 --> 08:42.323
Yeah, I know.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.618
You do? How?

08:45.452 --> 08:46.662
Come here.

08:49.957 --> 08:52.626
Do you still have
the geo coordinates to the tunnel?

08:52.709 --> 08:54.420
- Yes.
- We're less than ten minutes away.

08:54.503 --> 08:56.172
Then we'll get you out.

08:56.255 --> 08:57.464
What about you?

08:57.548 --> 09:00.592
Doesn't matter.

09:00.676 --> 09:02.553
Yes, it does.

09:02.636 --> 09:05.722
I'm not leaving without you.

09:05.806 --> 09:06.807
Listen...

09:08.600 --> 09:12.479
the tunnel, it's an old utility corridor.
Supposed to be a military base.

09:12.563 --> 09:15.399
Dad... tell me you're immune.

09:15.482 --> 09:16.901
The tunnel was finished,

09:16.984 --> 09:20.071
the site was scrapped,
so it's not on any maps.

09:20.154 --> 09:22.198
Stop talking about the tunnel.

09:22.281 --> 09:25.201
- Tell me you have the cure.
- There is no cure.

09:26.327 --> 09:27.411
How do you know?

09:29.038 --> 09:30.664
Because I worked on it.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.001
Get down. Get down.

09:43.635 --> 09:45.972
You had no right to guarantee that.

09:46.055 --> 09:47.598
Where's Pat?

09:47.681 --> 09:50.517
Look, he gave me his word, okay?
Will you do the same?

09:50.601 --> 09:52.353
For a Creeker, that means nothing.

09:52.436 --> 09:57.024
Yeah, but he came here on his own
and he wants to make this right.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.535
They're early.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.622
What are they doing here?

10:12.664 --> 10:15.667
The government sent them.

10:15.751 --> 10:17.586
But what the soldiers don't know

10:17.669 --> 10:20.464
is that they've been sent to
exterminate everyone in Pretty Lake.

10:22.383 --> 10:24.623
The troops think that the injections
are saving the kids,

10:24.635 --> 10:26.470
but the government lied to them.

10:26.553 --> 10:29.890
The soldiers, they wear these masks...

10:29.974 --> 10:32.476
but there's no protection
against the virus.

10:32.559 --> 10:36.855
It's only ever a matter of time
before even they'll be dead.

10:36.938 --> 10:40.567
You have to leave, now,
while there's still time.

10:40.651 --> 10:42.278
They can't just kill us.

10:42.987 --> 10:44.155
Yes, they can.

10:45.197 --> 10:46.657
We have to warn people.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.243
No, there's no time, Adam.
You understand?

10:50.327 --> 10:51.620
You have no choice.

10:52.579 --> 10:54.331
What about you?

10:54.415 --> 10:56.458
It's too late for me already.

10:58.377 --> 11:00.546
- I won't just leave you here.
- No.

11:02.464 --> 11:05.301
The moment I stepped into Pretty Lake,
I knew I was dead.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.139
I came back for you,

11:10.222 --> 11:13.059
and if you don't leave now, my death...

11:13.142 --> 11:14.768
will be for nothing.

11:15.769 --> 11:17.063
Just go.

11:18.147 --> 11:20.107
I can't, I...

11:20.191 --> 11:23.110
- I have to warn...
- There's no time, Adam.

11:26.363 --> 11:27.698
I love you.

11:28.865 --> 11:30.909
But I have to help Wiley.

11:30.992 --> 11:32.119
Dad.

12:07.071 --> 12:10.657
There are no cars parked here.
You think Pat might be inside?

12:10.741 --> 12:13.410
We're running out of options, okay?
We searched everywhere else.

12:16.455 --> 12:17.789
Slowly.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.209
Where's Pat?

12:21.543 --> 12:25.422
Ronnie, put the gun down. Okay?
That goes for the rest of you guys.

12:25.506 --> 12:27.026
Hey, we're not taking orders from you.

12:27.841 --> 12:31.178
Look, we just want Pat, okay?
Nobody needs to get hurt.

12:31.262 --> 12:34.515
Yeah, I agree, but Pat
admitted that he killed Amanda,

12:34.598 --> 12:37.058
- and he wants this to end.
- That's bullshit.

12:37.143 --> 12:39.520
We have a way to settle this
once and for all.

12:39.603 --> 12:41.855
They're waiting for us at the church.

13:12.602 --> 13:15.521
I still haven't heard
your proposal.

13:15.605 --> 13:16.939
I'm not gonna run anymore.

13:18.108 --> 13:20.193
I came into town so this ends.

13:21.486 --> 13:23.154
You want justice for your sister,

13:23.238 --> 13:25.906
and I'm offering justice.

13:25.991 --> 13:27.450
Even death?

13:32.913 --> 13:35.083
Yes, on one condition.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.542
Pat, don't do this, okay?

13:36.626 --> 13:38.253
It wasn't your fault.
You don't need to die for this.

13:38.336 --> 13:41.756
Ronnie... I don't want
any more people getting hurt.

13:42.798 --> 13:44.675
The retaliation has to end.

13:44.759 --> 13:46.177
Do you think if Chuck
had done this to one of ours,

13:46.261 --> 13:47.553
we'd be acting any differently?

13:47.637 --> 13:48.929
No, we'd want blood.

13:49.014 --> 13:50.556
I get that.

13:51.891 --> 13:55.311
And I'm willing to suffer
the consequences.

13:57.397 --> 13:59.690
I need promises from you and Chuck...

14:00.775 --> 14:03.361
that this ends with me, no matter what.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.412
Chuck?

14:13.121 --> 14:15.123
Whatever I decide?

14:17.375 --> 14:18.376
Yeah.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.339
- Hey, Mel?
- Yeah?

14:24.549 --> 14:26.426
How is your food supply holding up?

14:27.177 --> 14:28.844
Uh, we're running out.

14:28.928 --> 14:32.682
Okay, I can check some houses.
Maybe I can scrounge something up.

14:34.934 --> 14:36.394
Looks like you won't have to.

14:37.103 --> 14:38.188
Hey.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.482
Found these at the bar.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.234
Thanks.

14:43.318 --> 14:45.070
There's more where that came from.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.655
Gord, look at this.

14:53.703 --> 14:54.870
What's going on?

14:54.954 --> 14:58.124
What was Samantha thinking?
She wasn't supposed to send for everybody.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.335
Franny, watch the kids.

15:05.131 --> 15:09.344
Everybody knows
that this is a fair and just punishment.

15:09.427 --> 15:12.138
Chuck, you don't
want to do this.

15:12.222 --> 15:15.475
Pat, don't do this, please, okay?
We can fight our way out of this.

15:15.558 --> 15:16.684
Not without getting hurt.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.812
Ronnie, you made a promise.
I have your word.

15:20.813 --> 15:22.523
This has to be done.

15:22.607 --> 15:25.860
Anything else you want to say
before I pull the trigger?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.114
No, I'm done talking.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.747
Chuck, stop.
This is wrong.

15:37.830 --> 15:40.166
- Wiley, get out of the way.
- No.

15:42.377 --> 15:43.378
I was there, too.

15:45.088 --> 15:47.757
If you shoot him,
then you're gonna shoot me first.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.467
She's lying.
I was by myself.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.094
Wiley, this isn't your fight.

15:51.177 --> 15:53.971
Yes, it is.
I could've stayed, and I didn't.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.226
I don't know what your game is,
but you're lying.

15:58.309 --> 15:59.435
You're lying.

15:59.519 --> 16:01.020
No, she isn't.

16:06.317 --> 16:07.610
Tell them, Melissa.

16:08.736 --> 16:12.198
Last night, before it happened,
I caught them at the pharmacy.

16:12.282 --> 16:13.366
She was with Pat.

16:13.449 --> 16:15.326
- Stop, Melissa. She's your sister.
- No.

16:17.703 --> 16:21.666
No, she's finally taking responsibility
for her actions...

16:21.749 --> 16:22.917
and for her sins.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.835
Aren't you, Wiley?

16:26.296 --> 16:27.547
Yeah, that's right.

16:28.589 --> 16:29.882
Mom and Dad would be so proud.

16:29.965 --> 16:31.426
I don't care!

16:31.509 --> 16:34.179
Look...
he was driving!

16:34.262 --> 16:36.139
No, shoot me.

16:36.222 --> 16:39.142
Why don't you tell Chuck
who the father is?

16:40.726 --> 16:42.353
Thought I didn't know, didn't you?

16:45.356 --> 16:47.650
Melissa, stay out of this.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.485
If you don't tell him, I will.

16:50.486 --> 16:52.155
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:52.238 --> 16:54.490
This ends now!
Wiley, move!

16:54.574 --> 16:56.492
Tell him!

17:03.749 --> 17:06.042
It's your father, Chuck.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.273
Is that your phone?

17:33.321 --> 17:35.531
What's going on?

17:35.615 --> 17:37.450
Residents of Pretty Lake,

17:37.533 --> 17:40.286
we have found a cure
to stop the spread of the disease.

17:41.454 --> 17:43.206
So before the quarantine can be lifted,

17:43.289 --> 17:46.834
absolutely everyone
must receive an inoculation.

17:46.917 --> 17:50.087
This must be done
quickly and efficiently,

17:50.170 --> 17:53.383
as our soldiers are still at risk
of airborne exposure.

17:53.466 --> 17:56.636
Please make your way to
the penitentiary immediately.

17:56.719 --> 17:58.346
Thank you for your cooperation.

18:02.308 --> 18:03.309
It's over.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.271
I can't believe it.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.402
Chuck...

18:13.694 --> 18:15.321
put the gun down.

18:16.947 --> 18:18.366
Is that true?

18:19.825 --> 18:20.868
This is my brother?

18:21.744 --> 18:22.787
Yeah.

18:23.996 --> 18:25.080
How?

18:28.125 --> 18:29.252
Um...

18:30.378 --> 18:31.712
His name is Jason.

18:35.966 --> 18:37.134
Jason?

18:38.344 --> 18:39.387
Yeah.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.264
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.811
You and I aren't finished.

18:55.486 --> 18:56.487
Stop.

18:57.572 --> 18:59.114
No one's going anywhere.

19:00.115 --> 19:02.702
They've come to kill us.

19:04.662 --> 19:05.663
How much time left?

19:05.746 --> 19:09.292
Just over four hours before
we need to evac Pretty Lake.

19:09.375 --> 19:12.920
That doesn't seem like much
time to round up 1,000 kids.

19:13.003 --> 19:14.004
Stop.

19:14.088 --> 19:16.882
There's a large group in that church.
Call for more transport.

19:16.966 --> 19:18.468
Adam, this is ridiculous.

19:18.551 --> 19:21.596
How do you even know that
what your father told you is true?

19:21.679 --> 19:24.640
You have to believe me.
There is no cure.

19:24.724 --> 19:28.936
Okay, enough with the conspiracy theories.
Why would the government want us dead?

19:29.854 --> 19:31.564
They're cleaning up their mess.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.023
Yo, that doesn't make sense.

19:33.107 --> 19:35.067
All right, give us one good reason
we should believe you.

19:35.150 --> 19:39.238
Think about everything that's happened,
from the outbreak to the quarantine.

19:39.322 --> 19:41.616
There are more questions than answers.

19:41.699 --> 19:45.453
For one, why haven't we
been able to contact the outside?

19:45.536 --> 19:48.288
Well, the power going out
would've blown the cell towers.

19:48.373 --> 19:51.792
Then what about the landlines... or TVs?

19:51.876 --> 19:53.252
Why don't they work?

19:53.336 --> 19:56.088
We can't use walkies either, and they...
they don't need a tower.

19:56.964 --> 19:59.509
They've declared the area a no-fly zone.

19:59.592 --> 20:02.177
Think about what happened to
Vince and Kevin in the plane.

20:02.261 --> 20:05.765
My guess, the same thing would happen
to anyone trying to fly in.

20:05.848 --> 20:08.434
It's clear they don't want us
talking or knowing anything.

20:08.518 --> 20:10.770
This is a huge cover-up.

20:10.853 --> 20:12.146
All right, everyone.

20:12.229 --> 20:15.566
There's no time to waste.
We must leave immediately.

20:16.651 --> 20:18.653
Okay, guys, keep moving.
We gotta go.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.656
- Good job. That's it.
- What about my brother?

20:21.739 --> 20:24.299
We'll get everyone.
Don't worry. Please, keep moving.

20:28.245 --> 20:30.373
Please, everyone,
we need you to come with us.

20:30.456 --> 20:32.166
I need to get to my sister.

20:32.249 --> 20:33.418
There's no time.

20:33.501 --> 20:35.503
You guys should've been
heading to the prison already.

20:35.586 --> 20:38.381
She's just in the other room.
I promise I'll bring her right back.

20:38.464 --> 20:40.340
Sorry, that just can't happen.

20:40.425 --> 20:42.677
- How do we know this isn't a trap?
- A trap?

20:43.553 --> 20:45.513
We're risking our lives to help you.

20:45.596 --> 20:48.599
We only have so much time
before we could become infected.

20:49.392 --> 20:51.432
Prove to me that we aren't
being sent to our deaths.

20:51.477 --> 20:53.979
Listen,
I don't have time for this.

20:54.063 --> 20:58.192
The decontaminations need to happen
as quickly as possible, so move.

20:58.275 --> 20:59.402
Or what?

21:00.445 --> 21:01.446
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

21:01.529 --> 21:03.238
He was just asking a question.
You didn't have to do that.

21:03.322 --> 21:06.576
Yes, we did.
We are under severe time restrictions.

21:07.410 --> 21:09.912
You know what?
I believe Adam.

21:09.995 --> 21:10.996
Me, too.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.583
Hey.

21:15.835 --> 21:17.002
- Get down.
- Don't move.

21:17.086 --> 21:18.170
Okay, okay.

21:21.924 --> 21:24.343
If Adam's wrong, we're all screwed.

21:44.905 --> 21:46.657
Frances.

21:47.450 --> 21:49.744
I was starting to wonder if
the quarantine would ever be lifted.

21:49.827 --> 21:51.537
I know, it's incredible, isn't it?

21:52.497 --> 21:55.875
- Is... is Gord around?
- No, he wasn't in the van.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.084
Let's keep moving, please.

21:57.167 --> 21:59.754
Well, when you see him,
can you tell him I was asking for him?

21:59.837 --> 22:02.214
I'm sure he'll be glad to hear it.

22:02.297 --> 22:03.298
Okay.

22:08.679 --> 22:10.806
Okay, kids.
Right this way.

22:20.399 --> 22:22.652
So, you saw your dad?

22:23.193 --> 22:25.696
He came back.
He tried to save me.

22:26.739 --> 22:28.574
Did he fail or did you come back?

22:30.034 --> 22:31.410
A bit of both, I guess.

22:32.662 --> 22:34.872
Probably the biggest mistake of your life.

22:34.955 --> 22:38.250
I'm already starting to think
exactly the same thing.

22:41.837 --> 22:43.506
Well, thank you.

22:45.174 --> 22:46.759
It means a lot.

23:00.230 --> 23:02.817
Okay, Wiley and Melissa
are gonna stay here with Jason.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.194
The rest of you are with me.

23:05.277 --> 23:09.699
If Adam's right, there's not much time
before the soldiers die from the virus.

23:09.782 --> 23:14.161
Before that, we have to prevent them
from injecting as many kids as possible.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.955
If we can get to the prison control room,

23:16.038 --> 23:20.668
we can lock this place down
and end this decontamination process.

23:20.751 --> 23:22.086
If we lock all the doors,

23:22.169 --> 23:25.923
they'll focus on trying to get out
and stop injecting the kids.

23:26.006 --> 23:27.633
Then we wait for the soldiers to die.

23:27.717 --> 23:30.761
I just wish I knew my way around.

23:30.845 --> 23:32.346
I don't have a map or anything.

23:33.806 --> 23:35.099
I think I can help.

23:35.182 --> 23:36.516
How?

23:37.142 --> 23:38.310
I was an inmate.

23:52.783 --> 23:55.995
Okay, Cassidy, you're next.
Come on, kiddo.

23:59.999 --> 24:01.959
Have a seat right there.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.936
How you feeling?

24:21.020 --> 24:24.023
I just wish we weren't
putting everything on a long shot.

24:32.031 --> 24:33.824
When did you know?

24:34.700 --> 24:37.953
One day, I came early to pick you up
from your job at the dealership,

24:38.037 --> 24:40.706
and I saw the two of you in his office.

24:42.499 --> 24:43.500
You saw?

24:43.583 --> 24:47.129
Not enough to know for sure,
but I suspected as much.

24:49.048 --> 24:50.841
Why didn't you say anything?

24:53.844 --> 24:56.972
We weren't exactly the closest, Wiley.

24:57.056 --> 25:00.309
And when you told Mom and Dad that
you were pregnant and keeping the baby,

25:00.392 --> 25:01.852
I knew why you'd done it.

25:04.229 --> 25:06.732
- Why?
- To hurt them.

25:06.816 --> 25:09.359
You think I did this to hurt them?

25:11.445 --> 25:13.363
What other reason could there be?

25:13.447 --> 25:16.448
Well, because maybe there was something
between us that actually mattered...

25:16.491 --> 25:17.576
Shh!

25:34.134 --> 25:35.469
Someone's coming.

25:35.552 --> 25:37.429
Wiley, we have to hide.

25:38.973 --> 25:42.810
Okay, everyone. This is it.
Handcuffs on.

25:45.980 --> 25:47.689
Let's move it.
Everybody out.

25:47.773 --> 25:50.400
This group goes to cell block B.

25:59.076 --> 26:00.870
Are you sure
you can find the control room?

26:00.953 --> 26:04.039
Spent enough time here.
Yeah.

26:04.123 --> 26:05.249
What were you in for?

26:07.209 --> 26:08.293
Jaywalking.

26:08.377 --> 26:09.920
I don't like this at all...

26:10.004 --> 26:11.463
breaking into a prison.

26:11.546 --> 26:13.799
You got a better idea?

26:13.883 --> 26:15.009
No.

26:15.092 --> 26:17.762
I guess we're in this together.

26:17.845 --> 26:19.805
Who would've guessed?

26:19.889 --> 26:22.391
Yeah, who would've guessed?

26:22.474 --> 26:25.435
Okay, let's go.

26:29.523 --> 26:31.608
Hey, hey.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.110
What's going on?

26:33.193 --> 26:34.528
These guys resisted.

26:34.611 --> 26:36.947
They say they don't
want to be decontaminated.

26:37.656 --> 26:40.242
Hard to believe you kids
want to stay that badly.

26:40.325 --> 26:43.537
Don't you understand
what we're risking for you?

26:43.620 --> 26:45.622
Doesn't make sense to me either.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.999
Move.

26:53.297 --> 26:56.050
Corridor five.
Corridor five.

26:57.092 --> 27:00.012
Copy that. Move it.

27:00.971 --> 27:02.014
Watch out,
they're on the move.

27:02.097 --> 27:03.223
So make a right.

27:03.307 --> 27:06.476
- Let's go, people.
- Keep moving.

27:14.401 --> 27:16.402
We're almost there.

27:17.237 --> 27:19.364
- Where to?
- This way.

27:26.413 --> 27:29.291
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?

27:29.374 --> 27:32.086
We're taking these kids
to be decontaminated.

27:32.169 --> 27:34.629
That's back the way
you came from!

27:37.174 --> 27:39.259
- Hey.
- No need for that.

27:40.802 --> 27:42.512
Adam, go.

27:42.596 --> 27:43.889
Get these guys to the control room.

27:43.973 --> 27:45.640
Chuck and I will hold them here.

27:45.724 --> 27:48.405
I'm not leaving you here with him
after what happened at the church.

27:48.435 --> 27:50.187
You'll be more useful to them.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.480
Just go, Ronnie.

27:52.356 --> 27:53.357
Come on.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.109
You guys are making a mistake.

27:55.192 --> 27:56.443
Shut up.

28:07.079 --> 28:08.663
Why did you do it?

28:09.915 --> 28:11.000
Um...

28:12.042 --> 28:14.753
You know, he listened to me.

28:14.836 --> 28:16.005
It wasn't planned.

28:16.088 --> 28:18.840
It's not like I ever thought of him
that way or anything.

28:18.924 --> 28:21.510
Suddenly, we just kind of had...

28:21.593 --> 28:22.594
a connection.

28:23.470 --> 28:24.972
We both felt really bad about it.

28:25.055 --> 28:27.376
If you would've seen him,
then you'd know how sorry he was.

28:30.435 --> 28:32.897
And then I got pregnant.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.900
A guy like Charles Lotts
is expected to know better.

28:35.983 --> 28:38.152
You... you, I understand.

28:38.235 --> 28:39.861
I'm not a victim, Melissa.

28:39.945 --> 28:41.989
I chose to have this baby.

28:47.494 --> 28:48.996
Shit!

28:52.416 --> 28:53.875
What are you two doing?

28:53.959 --> 28:56.628
You're supposed to report
to the jail for decontamination.

28:56.711 --> 28:57.922
Come on, let's go.

28:58.005 --> 29:00.382
All right, flat on the floor.
Hands behind your back, now.

29:00.465 --> 29:02.634
- Let's go.
- You don't want to do this.

29:04.303 --> 29:06.680
Stop! Drop your weapon!

29:12.102 --> 29:13.342
You guys all right?

29:13.353 --> 29:14.396
- We're okay.
- Go!

29:14.479 --> 29:15.730
I think they're headed
to the control room.

29:15.814 --> 29:17.983
- Okay, where to now?
- It's just down here.

29:18.900 --> 29:21.611
Wait.
Let me check it out first.

29:27.534 --> 29:29.786
- Stop! Identify yourself!
- Shit!

29:29.869 --> 29:30.870
We're screwed.

29:30.955 --> 29:33.457
- Adam, go now. I'll cover you.
- Identify yourself!

29:33.540 --> 29:35.084
It's down the hall.
Second door on your right.

29:35.167 --> 29:36.168
You're not coming?

29:36.251 --> 29:37.461
If this goes south,
I'll need to get them out.

29:37.544 --> 29:38.545
Go, Adam!

29:38.628 --> 29:40.672
You need to lock it down
to stop the injections!

29:41.631 --> 29:42.841
Run!

30:02.069 --> 30:03.070
Stop.

30:06.823 --> 30:08.408
You don't know what you're doing.

30:09.534 --> 30:10.953
You're supposed to be dead.

30:11.036 --> 30:13.163
People believe
what they want to believe.

30:14.414 --> 30:16.166
Bile isn't so hard to fake.

30:18.627 --> 30:21.921
You wouldn't listen. All you had to...
All you had to do was leave.

30:23.173 --> 30:25.009
I didn't want you to see any of this.

30:27.011 --> 30:28.303
Why'd you come back?

30:29.013 --> 30:31.223
I couldn't go knowing
everyone would be killed.

30:31.974 --> 30:33.017
Hmm.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.477
I had to at least try to save 'em.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.063
No, they can't be saved.
It's too late.

30:38.147 --> 30:40.315
- Adam...
- I can, I can save them...

30:40.399 --> 30:42.234
Stop. Adam, stop.

30:43.652 --> 30:47.447
'Cause even if there was a chance
that you could save those kids...

30:47.531 --> 30:49.824
you risk infecting
everyone else on Earth.

30:51.368 --> 30:53.662
Look, no prison is 100% secure,

30:53.745 --> 30:56.290
and we feel it's only a matter of time
before someone escapes.

30:56.373 --> 30:57.707
"We"?

30:58.875 --> 31:00.460
What do you mean, "we"?

31:01.628 --> 31:05.382
I synthesized the pathogen
by splicing a viral genome with my own...

31:06.091 --> 31:07.717
my DNA.

31:09.178 --> 31:11.221
And that's why you're immune.
Because it's already a part of you.

31:11.305 --> 31:13.348
It's a part of me.

31:14.433 --> 31:17.186
And we're the only two that can
leave here without infecting others.

31:17.269 --> 31:19.354
Everyone else here is a carrier.

31:24.693 --> 31:26.334
Melissa, we have to do something.

31:26.403 --> 31:28.738
Wiley, how can you even
be sure that Adam's right?

31:28.822 --> 31:31.241
I trust him.
It makes sense, okay?

31:32.534 --> 31:34.036
Please! Let us go!

31:34.119 --> 31:36.163
The decontaminations are gonna kill us!

31:36.246 --> 31:38.790
Please, you're sending us to our deaths!
Let us go!

31:38.873 --> 31:40.459
Wiley, stop it.
You're gonna piss them off.

31:40.542 --> 31:42.711
Just shut up!
We're less than a minute from the prison.

31:42.794 --> 31:44.635
Craig, what's wrong?

31:45.547 --> 31:46.756
Craig! Craig!

31:50.844 --> 31:51.845
You're lying.

31:52.846 --> 31:56.183
Why should I believe you?
Nothing you've said is true.

31:56.266 --> 32:00.312
If you and I are the only ones immune,
why aren't they dead then?

32:00.395 --> 32:02.397
They will be, when they turn 22.

32:02.481 --> 32:04.733
Because it's tapped into
their biological clocks.

32:04.816 --> 32:07.026
This doesn't make sense.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.739
Why design a virus like this?
What for?

32:10.822 --> 32:15.702
The projections on population growth...
they're terrifying.

32:15.785 --> 32:18.705
And it was in our best interest
to look for a solution.

32:19.789 --> 32:22.501
This is about population control.

32:23.127 --> 32:26.880
You know we're past the tipping point
in greenhouse gas emissions?

32:27.839 --> 32:30.842
Food? Water?

32:30.925 --> 32:33.345
How long do you think we have
before those resources run out?

32:33.428 --> 32:35.972
This is not science fiction, Adam.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.850
This planet cannot be sustained.

32:38.933 --> 32:40.894
The virus was engineered
to thin the population.

32:40.977 --> 32:45.607
To cull the weak and the elderly
to give the rest of us a chance.

32:45.690 --> 32:48.067
A chance at survival.

32:49.861 --> 32:51.405
But it worked too well.

32:52.447 --> 32:54.366
All it needs is to
penetrate one host cell,

32:54.449 --> 32:56.034
and it will replicate aggressively.

32:56.118 --> 32:58.370
And you cannot stop it once it's begun.

32:59.996 --> 33:01.206
So this was a test.

33:01.290 --> 33:02.541
What?

33:03.458 --> 33:07.003
- This was a test on innocent people.
- No, of course not.

33:08.213 --> 33:11.007
We didn't even try it on mice.

33:11.925 --> 33:12.926
Look...

33:14.052 --> 33:15.845
there was a scientist, who, uh...

33:15.929 --> 33:17.139
Art Carey?

33:17.222 --> 33:18.598
Yes.

33:19.891 --> 33:23.812
Art and I never did see eye to eye.
And when he went rogue...

33:23.895 --> 33:25.939
I knew I was in danger,
so I disappeared.

33:26.022 --> 33:29.359
I thought that would buy me
some protection until I could find him.

33:29.443 --> 33:32.987
I thought that it would
save you from getting hurt.

33:33.071 --> 33:35.699
And...
I was wrong.

33:37.242 --> 33:38.660
Why are you here?

33:38.743 --> 33:40.329
I came back to get you out.

33:42.831 --> 33:44.291
To clean up this mess.

33:44.374 --> 33:45.792
To murder everyone.

33:45.875 --> 33:48.753
No, no. We've gotta stop the virus
before it spreads.

33:49.754 --> 33:53.758
And the only way to do that
is to kill all the carriers.

33:54.718 --> 33:56.220
You see that, don't you, Adam?

33:57.596 --> 33:59.431
That is the humane thing to do.

34:08.648 --> 34:11.150
- Any clue where we are?
- No.

34:12.694 --> 34:15.530
- You hear something?
- No, you?

34:23.288 --> 34:25.456
Let's keep going up,
see if we can get to the roof.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.541
Okay.

34:30.629 --> 34:32.589
I hear them.
They're down there!

34:33.507 --> 34:34.549
Stop! Do not move!

34:37.010 --> 34:38.762
Go, go, go, go!

34:45.601 --> 34:47.186
Shit. I'm out.

34:47.271 --> 34:49.188
Well, what are we gonna do?

34:49.273 --> 34:51.400
- We should go back.
- Let's go. Go!

34:52.317 --> 34:54.319
Hands up!
Or I'll shoot!

34:54.402 --> 34:57.196
Guns on the ground, now!

35:03.077 --> 35:04.288
Right here.

35:06.290 --> 35:07.582
Have a seat.

35:14.298 --> 35:15.299
Adam.

35:15.382 --> 35:19.052
You step away from the controls,
I will save you.

35:20.262 --> 35:22.389
I can't let you kill everyone.

35:23.723 --> 35:25.600
I can't.
There has to be another way.

35:25.684 --> 35:27.727
I've told you everything, Adam.
You know that there isn't.

35:27.811 --> 35:30.171
- Come on, I'm not...
- Hey, hey. Stop. Stop, or I'll shoot.

35:30.188 --> 35:31.856
I mean it.

35:34.318 --> 35:35.569
No, you won't.

35:36.903 --> 35:38.822
'Cause you understand that I'm right.

35:39.614 --> 35:41.658
That at least you can save yourself.

35:43.743 --> 35:45.203
- At least...
- Stop, or I'll shoot!

35:45.287 --> 35:47.789
Okay, you and I both know
that you're not gonna shoot me.

35:47.872 --> 35:49.541
We don't have time for this, Adam.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.168
I'm on your side!

35:52.251 --> 35:53.503
I need to stop this.

35:53.587 --> 35:55.630
Trust me! Please!

35:56.881 --> 36:00.510
Now, our operatives can't resist the virus
much longer, even with the suits.

36:00.594 --> 36:02.261
You have to trust me, Adam.

36:02.346 --> 36:05.014
- Stop. Stop. I said stop!
- No! Adam!

36:05.098 --> 36:06.766
I love you.

36:06.850 --> 36:08.602
And I know you're gonna
do the right thing.

36:24.117 --> 36:25.494
I'm sorry.

36:32.459 --> 36:34.961
Like lambs to the slaughter.

36:43.177 --> 36:45.138
Go, go!

36:45.221 --> 36:46.973
Stop! We got 'em.

36:50.018 --> 36:52.228
I'm out.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.063
- We're screwed.
- Seems like it.

36:55.899 --> 36:58.860
Look, it's important for you to know...

36:58.943 --> 37:00.695
your sister's death was an accident.

37:03.573 --> 37:04.908
Do you believe me?

37:07.118 --> 37:08.453
Yeah, I do.

37:10.872 --> 37:12.331
Good.

37:18.296 --> 37:19.423
Stay here.

37:38.149 --> 37:40.109
Attention.

37:40.193 --> 37:41.820
The control room has been compromised.

37:41.903 --> 37:43.822
Mission has been aborted.

37:43.905 --> 37:47.200
All military personnel must
evacuate the prison immediately.

37:47.283 --> 37:50.369
I repeat, evacuate the prison immediately.

37:50.454 --> 37:54.290
Melissa?
Melissa, wake up, come on.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.711
No, come on, wake up!

37:59.754 --> 38:01.339
Melissa.

38:03.675 --> 38:05.301
Melissa, come on!

38:54.733 --> 38:57.862
- You think it's a trap?
- No.

38:57.946 --> 39:01.365
They're dead from the virus.
I need to find Franny.

39:02.826 --> 39:04.077
It's this way.

39:34.648 --> 39:35.942
What happened?

39:38.069 --> 39:41.197
Your brother saved my life.

39:53.626 --> 39:55.044
Franny!

40:23.114 --> 40:24.323
Franny?

40:28.369 --> 40:30.038
I was next, Gord.

40:31.122 --> 40:32.373
I was next.

41:02.445 --> 41:03.654
Did you see them?

41:10.411 --> 41:12.788
Why did they need to kill us?

41:15.666 --> 41:17.751
What harm could we have done?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.089
You know, we did everything they asked.

41:23.091 --> 41:26.302
They wouldn't have done
something like this

41:26.385 --> 41:28.387
if they knew they were going to die.

41:30.514 --> 41:32.433
That they were killing kids.

41:39.023 --> 41:40.358
Then why?

41:43.319 --> 41:45.321
They were lied to.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.706
Everyone's been lied to.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.168
This isn't over.

42:03.331 --> 42:05.333
They'll be back.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.922
So, what are we supposed to do now?

42:13.799 --> 42:16.510
Just wait around to die?

42:20.473 --> 42:21.474
No.

42:25.018 --> 42:26.061
Then what?

42:30.899 --> 42:32.109
I have a way out.
