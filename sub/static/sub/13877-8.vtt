05:35.607 --> 05:36.309
Thank you, Carl.

05:36.343 --> 05:37.310
Carl: Hey. Don't talk.

05:37.344 --> 05:38.312
Hop to it.

05:38.346 --> 05:39.748
And how about you install a

05:39.781 --> 05:41.316
subwoofer in there, too?

05:41.350 --> 05:44.655
Or I will, uh, anger the Gods.

05:44.688 --> 05:45.723
You're giving him the

05:45.757 --> 05:46.624
undercoating, right?

05:46.659 --> 05:47.760
Master Shake: Why are you

05:47.793 --> 05:48.561
doing this to me?

05:48.595 --> 05:49.863
Why am I doing this to you?

05:49.897 --> 05:51.699
Oh! You killed me.

05:51.732 --> 05:52.601
Remember?

05:52.634 --> 05:53.702
Master Shake: Sorry. My bad.

05:53.735 --> 05:55.839
I will ultimately crush your

05:55.873 --> 05:58.377
skull with a piece of concrete.

05:58.410 --> 06:01.588
But for now, let's do this.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.890
Master Shake: My hands are

06:02.924 --> 06:04.159
getting really tired.

06:04.192 --> 06:05.528
You know, hold that thought,

06:05.561 --> 06:06.863
because I got a touch of angel

06:06.896 --> 06:10.335
diarrhea.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.204
Master Shake: Frylock!

06:12.238 --> 06:13.440
Come on, get this thing to go!

06:13.473 --> 06:14.141
Hurry!

06:14.174 --> 06:15.143
Frylock: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:15.176 --> 06:16.110
Don't hit it like that.

06:16.144 --> 06:17.246
What are you trying to do?

06:17.279 --> 06:18.481
Master Shake: I need to hire

06:18.514 --> 06:19.649
a demon immediately! Please!

06:19.683 --> 06:20.517
I mean, sir!

06:20.551 --> 06:21.686
I mean -- stop being nice!

06:21.719 --> 06:22.787
Frylock: You can check out

06:22.820 --> 06:23.521
Craigslist.

06:23.556 --> 06:24.690
Master Shake: Good idea!

06:24.723 --> 06:25.358
Thanks, man.

06:25.391 --> 06:26.560
I mean, I know that already!

06:26.593 --> 06:28.396
Now get out of your room so you

06:28.429 --> 06:30.266
can go be stupid somewhere else!

06:30.299 --> 06:32.870
Please, jerkface!

06:32.903 --> 06:34.238
Why aren't you waxing --

06:34.272 --> 06:35.640
ohh! Oh.

06:35.674 --> 06:36.909
Do you have a bathroom?

06:36.942 --> 06:37.911
Frylock: Oddly, no.

06:37.944 --> 06:38.912
Well, how do you --

06:38.945 --> 06:39.947
Frylock: We don't.

06:39.981 --> 06:41.483
What?

06:41.516 --> 06:43.987
Uh, I'll be right back.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.389
Frylock: Uh, who was that?

06:45.422 --> 06:46.624
Master Shake: You could see

06:46.657 --> 06:47.492
him? Hurry up.

06:47.526 --> 06:48.527
How long does angel diarrhea

06:48.560 --> 06:49.161
last?

06:49.195 --> 06:49.962
Frylock: I don't know.

06:49.996 --> 06:50.831
It probably varies.

06:50.864 --> 06:51.932
Why don't you just google it?

06:51.965 --> 06:55.838
Master Shake: Aah!

06:55.871 --> 06:57.274
Hey, how do you spell

06:57.308 --> 06:58.409
"diarrhea"?

06:58.442 --> 06:59.777
Ah, you must be Neil.

06:59.812 --> 07:01.454
I recognize you from your

07:01.487 --> 07:02.255
profile.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.858
No, Neelzebub.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.460
Master Shake: Hmm.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.628
How about just "bub"?

07:06.662 --> 07:07.597
Neelzebub.

07:07.630 --> 07:08.731
Master Shake: Fine. Great.

07:08.765 --> 07:09.399
Whatever.

07:09.432 --> 07:10.468
Come on in.

07:10.501 --> 07:11.803
Did you bring references?

07:11.836 --> 07:12.872
This spider.

07:12.905 --> 07:14.674
It begged for mercy.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.310
But it would receive none on

07:16.343 --> 07:17.279
this day.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.413
Master Shake: Then you are

07:18.446 --> 07:19.114
he.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.984
Tell me everything I must do to

07:21.017 --> 07:25.324
kill the mighty angel.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.527
Well, angel, we meet again.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.698
But this time, it is I who

07:29.731 --> 07:31.433
possess the power.

07:31.466 --> 07:33.436
Isn't that right, neil?

07:33.470 --> 07:35.573
Ugh! Neelzebub!

07:35.607 --> 07:36.641
Master Shake: Neelzebub,

07:36.674 --> 07:37.476
right.

07:37.510 --> 07:38.978
You may be interested to know

07:39.012 --> 07:40.715
that I purchased six cases of

07:40.748 --> 07:42.417
beer for neelzebub and his

07:42.450 --> 07:44.086
underaged friends, and then I

07:44.120 --> 07:45.923
am going to drive them all to

07:45.956 --> 07:47.325
the insane clown posse show.

07:47.358 --> 07:48.627
And how is that gonna defeat

07:48.660 --> 07:49.461
me?

07:49.494 --> 07:50.563
Master Shake: That's a pretty

07:50.596 --> 07:51.397
good question.

07:51.431 --> 07:52.098
Neil?

07:52.132 --> 07:53.668
Hey, guys, you want to see me

07:53.701 --> 07:54.502
fart on something?

07:54.536 --> 07:55.538
Master Shake: Neil, over

07:55.571 --> 07:56.104
here, please.

07:56.139 --> 07:57.607
Oh, God!

07:57.641 --> 07:59.910
Read from the scrolls!

07:59.944 --> 08:02.722
Master Shake: Hmm.

08:02.755 --> 08:03.656
Vampire.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.994
Bite your neck and set your head

08:06.027 --> 08:07.529
on fire.

08:07.562 --> 08:09.599
Are those actual icp lyrics?

08:09.632 --> 08:10.667
Master Shake: Yeah.

08:10.701 --> 08:11.803
[ laughs ]

08:11.836 --> 08:13.405
"i'll hypnotize you, then bite

08:13.438 --> 08:14.773
your neck, then set your head

08:14.807 --> 08:15.474
on fire."

08:15.508 --> 08:16.543
There's, like, one --

08:16.576 --> 08:17.712
one item in there is not

08:17.745 --> 08:19.047
necessary at all, and you can

08:19.080 --> 08:19.881
take your pick.

08:19.915 --> 08:21.384
Master Shake: Neil, he's not

08:21.418 --> 08:22.019
doing anything.

08:22.052 --> 08:22.920
Got nothing here.

08:22.953 --> 08:24.022
It's gonna take a few

08:24.055 --> 08:25.557
minutes now, 'cause you weren't

08:25.590 --> 08:26.826
standing still and you didn't

08:26.859 --> 08:27.760
have your hands up.

08:27.793 --> 08:28.762
So can you, like, drive us to

08:28.795 --> 08:29.463
the concert now?

08:29.496 --> 08:30.498
Master Shake: But your mom's

08:30.532 --> 08:31.399
gonna pick you up, right?

08:31.433 --> 08:32.934
Yeah, um, lee's mom.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.136
Master Shake: Leeman the

08:34.169 --> 08:34.972
demon?

08:35.005 --> 08:36.573
I thought he was grounded.

08:36.607 --> 08:37.743
He's sneaking out.

08:37.775 --> 08:38.945
Wait, wait, wait.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.780
If he's sneaking out, how is his

08:40.813 --> 08:42.150
mom going to pick you up?

08:42.183 --> 08:43.585
Does he tell his mom he's

08:43.618 --> 08:44.419
sneaking out?

08:44.453 --> 08:45.555
'cause then it's not really

08:45.588 --> 08:46.222
sneaking out, right?

08:46.256 --> 08:47.190
Master Shake: Yeah, neil?

08:47.223 --> 08:48.560
She won't know about it.

08:48.593 --> 08:50.028
Uh, well, can you pick us up,

08:50.062 --> 08:50.729
also?

08:50.763 --> 08:51.798
Master Shake: Both ways?!

08:51.831 --> 08:52.932
You're just chauffeuring

08:52.966 --> 08:53.768
these guys around.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.002
Master Shake: You never even

08:55.036 --> 08:56.004
told lee's mom, did you?

08:56.037 --> 08:56.705
Did you?!

08:56.738 --> 08:57.640
That was not part of the deal,

08:57.674 --> 08:58.207
neil.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.577
Ooh, quick question.

08:59.610 --> 09:01.052
Is this is part of the deal?

09:01.085 --> 09:02.020
Whoa! No way!

09:02.053 --> 09:03.589
Oh, my God, that's [bleep]

09:03.623 --> 09:04.424
awesome.

09:04.457 --> 09:05.592
Master Shake: Aah! Aah!

09:05.626 --> 09:06.509
That's your cue, neil!

09:06.543 --> 09:07.028
Come on!

09:07.061 --> 09:07.962
Whoa!

09:07.996 --> 09:09.498
No way!

09:09.532 --> 09:10.600
Master Shake: Call upon the

09:10.634 --> 09:11.167
power! Aah!

09:11.200 --> 09:12.570
Can you show me that?

09:12.603 --> 09:13.137
Show me that!

09:13.171 --> 09:14.473
You got to show me that!

09:14.506 --> 09:15.707
Well, maybe when you're

09:15.742 --> 09:16.543
older, tiger.

09:16.576 --> 09:17.711
How old are you, anyway?

09:17.745 --> 09:18.912
14 1/2.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.482
Master Shake: Neil!

09:20.515 --> 09:22.151
You said you were fully licensed

09:22.184 --> 09:22.886
to do this!

09:22.919 --> 09:25.089
Well, yeah, I said that, but

09:25.122 --> 09:27.025
my dad's an attorney, and he

09:27.059 --> 09:28.728
says you got to get everything

09:28.762 --> 09:29.829
in writing.

09:29.863 --> 09:30.530
Sorry.

09:30.564 --> 09:31.632
Master Shake: Fine.

09:31.666 --> 09:32.167
You know what?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.134
I'm ending this now.

09:33.168 --> 09:34.470
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

09:34.503 --> 09:35.172
Bye.

09:35.205 --> 09:36.006
Master Shake: Nice to meet

09:36.039 --> 09:36.640
you all.

09:36.674 --> 09:38.677
I'll see you all in hell.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.685
Mr. 2 Dope, perhaps you would

09:43.718 --> 09:45.487
care to read, for the ladies and

09:45.521 --> 09:46.890
gentlemen of the jury, the

09:46.923 --> 09:48.558
lyrics from your popular song

"Blacken Your Eyes."

You [bleep] freaky bitch.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.889

10:03.922 --> 10:05.224
offensive about that?
