01:30.347 --> 01:32.780
WATCH THIS,
SHREDDER.

01:32.881 --> 01:34.514
YOU MUDDLE-HEADED
MUTANTS.

01:34.715 --> 01:36.047
QUIT WASTING TIME.

01:36.115 --> 01:38.715
START OPERATION
TURTLE TERMINATOR.

01:38.716 --> 01:41.649
RIGHT, BOSS.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

01:49.486 --> 01:51.286
I HAVE A DATE

01:51.354 --> 01:53.352
SO I CAN'T
BE LATE

01:53.488 --> 01:55.354
DON'T WANT
TO MAKE HIM W-WAI--

02:03.924 --> 02:05.657
DON'T MAKE NO NOISE.

02:05.724 --> 02:07.191
DO LIKE I DO.

02:11.794 --> 02:13.360
DO LIKE THAT?

02:13.428 --> 02:14.460
OK...

02:14.528 --> 02:16.260
IF I HAVE TO.

02:17.529 --> 02:20.862
OOH, YOU POOR MAN...
OR MUTANT.

02:20.997 --> 02:22.263
MUTANT?

02:30.566 --> 02:32.565
ANOTHER MUTANT!

02:32.667 --> 02:35.166
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

02:36.234 --> 02:39.234
WHAT WE'RE DOING, LADY,
IS KIDNAPPING YOU.

02:39.236 --> 02:42.068
AND DON'T GIVE US
NO TROUBLE.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.102
KIDNAPPING ME?

02:44.170 --> 02:46.636
OH, NO.
NO, PLEASE DON'T!

02:46.704 --> 02:49.105
I LOVE IT WHEN THEY BEG.

02:49.172 --> 02:51.906
YOU--YOU CAN'T
KIDNAP ME TODAY.

02:51.974 --> 02:53.005
I HAVE GOT A LUNCH DATE

02:53.073 --> 02:56.174
WITH CHANNEL 6's
INCREDIBLY HANDSOME
ANCHORMAN.

02:56.241 --> 02:59.374
HEY--HEY, YOU CAN COME BACK
TOMORROW AND KIDNAP ME.

02:59.509 --> 03:00.908
OOH! HOW COME
WE ALWAYS GET

03:00.975 --> 03:03.209
THE TOUGH ASSIGNMENTS?

03:16.381 --> 03:18.081
READY, TURTLES?

03:18.148 --> 03:20.082
YEAH.
I'LL HIT HIM HIGH.

03:20.148 --> 03:21.647
I'LL HIT HIM LOW.

03:21.715 --> 03:24.082
AND I'LL TAKE
WHAT'S LEFT. HA HA.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.418
A FINE BUNCH OF NINJAS
WE ARE--

03:31.485 --> 03:34.786
WE FELL FOR THE OLDEST
TRICK IN THE BOOK.

03:34.853 --> 03:36.753
THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED IS,

03:36.821 --> 03:39.787
THINGS ARE NOT
ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR.

03:39.855 --> 03:42.521
LEARN TO TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.021
NOT YOUR EYES.

03:45.256 --> 03:46.623
IT'S THE TURTLECOM.

03:46.757 --> 03:47.723
LEONARDO HERE.

03:47.791 --> 03:49.357
WHAT'S WRONG, APRIL?

03:49.425 --> 03:50.958
I'M AT IRMA'S APARTMENT.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.924
THE PLACE IS A COMPLETE MESS.

03:53.093 --> 03:53.925
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

03:53.992 --> 03:55.925
IRMA'S PLACE
IS ALWAYS A MESS.

03:55.993 --> 03:57.626
IRMA IS MISSING,

03:57.694 --> 04:01.261
AND I'M SURE ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP TOOK HER.

04:01.495 --> 04:02.328
WAIT RIGHT THERE,
APRIL.

04:02.395 --> 04:03.328
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

04:03.396 --> 04:05.928
LET'S GO, TURTLES.

04:11.432 --> 04:13.698
WHERE ARE YOU BOZOS
TAKING ME?

04:13.766 --> 04:17.233
HEY, LADY, YOU ASK
TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.434
WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO LEARN ANYTHING?

04:20.735 --> 04:22.734
WELL, YOU JUST BETTER
GET ME BACK

04:22.802 --> 04:24.835
IN TIME FOR MY DATE
OR--OR I'LL--

04:24.936 --> 04:26.969
OR YOU'LL WHAT?

04:28.137 --> 04:29.970
MR. SHREDDER?

04:30.038 --> 04:31.737
THAT'S RIGHT, IRMA.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.271
WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE
LOW-RENT HIDEOUT.

04:35.373 --> 04:38.073
LOOK, LOOK.
I'D LOVE TO GET
THE COMPLETE TOUR,

04:38.141 --> 04:40.774
BUT...I HAVE A DATE.

04:40.909 --> 04:43.307
YOU CERTAINLY DO...

04:43.375 --> 04:45.442
WITH THIS ROBOT.

04:45.510 --> 04:48.210
IT'S PROGRAMMED TO DO
JUST ONE THING--

04:48.277 --> 04:51.377
FIND AND DESTROY
THE TURTLES.

04:51.445 --> 04:54.312
BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
GOT TO DO WITH ME?

04:54.379 --> 04:56.078
YOU'LL SOON SEE.

04:56.113 --> 04:58.845
TURTLE TERMINATOR,
SELF-ACTIVATE.

05:02.615 --> 05:05.247
F-F-FORGET IT,
FELLAS.

05:05.315 --> 05:07.148
I'M NOT
INTO HEAVY METAL.

05:09.683 --> 05:11.183
HEY, CUT IT OUT.

05:11.251 --> 05:12.684
IT TICKLES.

05:12.752 --> 05:17.152
IT'S WORKING PERFECTLY.

05:17.219 --> 05:20.386
HEY...
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.120
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

05:23.188 --> 05:25.554
OH! IT'S ME!

05:25.622 --> 05:26.988
OH, AT LAST,

05:27.056 --> 05:30.523
THE PLAN THAT WILL FINALLY
DESTROY THE TURTLES.

05:31.758 --> 05:34.357
WOW, IT WAS ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP

05:34.424 --> 05:37.324
THAT CRASHED THIS BASH,
FOR SURE.

05:37.392 --> 05:39.259
BUT WHERE DID THEY
TAKE IRMA?

05:39.326 --> 05:40.993
THAT MIGHT BE A CLUE.

05:41.060 --> 05:44.827
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
TRACKED IT IN.

05:44.895 --> 05:47.362
IF WE KNEW WHAT IT IS
AND WHERE IT CAME FROM,

05:47.462 --> 05:49.095
WE'D KNOW WHERE
THEY TOOK IRMA.

05:49.297 --> 05:50.829
THEN LET'S
GET STARTED.

05:50.897 --> 05:52.930
APRIL, YOU
BETTER GET BACK
TO CHANNEL 6

05:52.998 --> 05:54.597
IN CASE SHE
TURNS UP THERE.

05:54.665 --> 05:57.232
OK, GUYS,
BUT BE CAREFUL.

06:00.766 --> 06:04.567
WHAT IS YOUR MISSION,
ANDROID IRMA?

06:04.635 --> 06:05.733
LOCATE TURTLES.

06:05.801 --> 06:07.068
ZAP TURTLES.

06:07.135 --> 06:08.234
EXACTLY.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.235
AT THE FIRST SIGN
OF THE TURTLES,

06:10.303 --> 06:11.836
BLAST THEM!

06:11.903 --> 06:14.303
BLAST TURTLES
AT FIRST SIGN.

06:14.305 --> 06:17.437
SPLENDID.
NOW GET TO IT.

06:19.306 --> 06:21.572
HEY, GET YOUR BALLOONS
RIGHT HERE!

06:21.640 --> 06:24.073
TAKE SOME HOME
TO THE KIDDIES.

06:28.209 --> 06:30.308
TURTLES...

06:30.376 --> 06:31.909
ZAP TURTLES.

06:38.146 --> 06:41.179
MUST BE
A BALLOON HATER.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.013
ACCORDING
TO MY ANALYSIS,

06:45.081 --> 06:47.180
THAT SLIMY GREEN PLANT
FROM IRMA'S APARTMENT

06:47.282 --> 06:49.381
IS A HUNK OF SEAWEED.

06:49.449 --> 06:50.882
SEAWEED?

06:50.950 --> 06:54.483
THAT MEANS THE MUTANTS
MUST BE OPERATING

06:54.551 --> 06:56.484
OUT OF THE WATERFRONT
DISTRICT.

06:56.552 --> 06:58.484
HEY, GIVE THE LADY
A CIGAR.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.986
WE'RE HEADED
FOR THE WATERFRONT NOW.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.786
DON'T WORRY, APRIL.
WE'LL FIND IRMA.

07:03.821 --> 07:05.320
I HOPE SO.

07:05.388 --> 07:07.354
IRMA!

07:07.655 --> 07:09.388
IRMA, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:09.423 --> 07:11.522
THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

07:20.026 --> 07:23.625
OH, STILL NO SIGN OF IRMA...
OR SEAWEED, EITHER.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.693
I'LL CHECK IN
WITH APRIL.

07:25.761 --> 07:28.193
DONATELLO TO APRIL.
DONATELLO TO APRIL.

07:28.295 --> 07:29.894
WHAT'S UP, FELLAS?

07:29.963 --> 07:31.528
APRIL, WHERE ARE YOU?

07:31.596 --> 07:34.095
I'M HERE AT CHANNEL 6
WITH IRMA.

07:34.231 --> 07:35.996
IRMA? SHE'S THERE?

07:36.065 --> 07:37.130
IS SHE OK?

07:37.198 --> 07:38.330
OK?

07:38.398 --> 07:39.597
SHE'S FANTASTIC.

07:43.899 --> 07:45.333
CHANNEL 6.
PLEASE HOLD.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.833
CHANNEL 6.
PLEASE HOLD.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.867
IRMA, WOULD YOU PLEASE
FIND THE WILSON FILE

07:49.902 --> 07:52.202
YOU LOST 3 DAYS AGO?

07:52.270 --> 07:53.301
I REALLY NEED--

07:53.369 --> 07:55.769
HERE.
NOW GET OFF MY BACK.

07:55.837 --> 07:57.737
IRMA, YOU AMAZE ME.

07:57.805 --> 07:59.771
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, IRMA,

07:59.838 --> 08:01.770
BUCKING
FOR A BIG RAISE?

08:02.006 --> 08:05.606
NO, I'M ON A MISSION,
NUMSKULL.

08:05.741 --> 08:07.406
AND SHE INSISTS
ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP

08:07.473 --> 08:09.307
WERE NEVER
IN HER APARTMENT.

08:09.375 --> 08:12.108
YEAH, SURE. AND I'VE
NEVER BEEN IN THE SEWERS.

08:12.175 --> 08:16.375
THEN WHO OR WHAT
MADE THOSE BIG HOLES
IN IRMA'S WALL?

08:16.443 --> 08:19.977
WELL, MAYBE LIKE SOME
TRULY HUMONGOUS MICE.

08:20.045 --> 08:21.511
WAIT!

08:21.646 --> 08:25.245
THAT'S A TRANSPORT-MODULE
TUNNEL.

08:25.313 --> 08:27.646
THAT MEANS SHREDDER
IS DEFINITELY IN THE AREA.

08:27.714 --> 08:30.314
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
MEANS, DON'T YOU?
YEAH.

08:30.382 --> 08:31.447
IT'S TIME FOR US TURTLES

08:31.515 --> 08:33.282
TO CATCH SOME
HUMONGOUS MICE.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.384
HI THERE,
IRMA BABY.

08:40.451 --> 08:42.485
OH, HELLO.

08:42.552 --> 08:45.186
WELL, THIS IS IT,
LUCKY LADY--

08:45.253 --> 08:49.220
YOUR BIG LUNCH DATE
WITH ME. HA HA.

08:49.255 --> 08:50.187
GET LOST.

08:50.254 --> 08:52.187
YOU MUST HAVE
FORGOTTEN.

08:52.322 --> 08:56.822
I'M GRANTING YOU
ONE FULL HOUR
WITH YOURS TRULY.

08:56.924 --> 08:59.356
I HAVE A MISSION.
I CANNOT LEAVE.

08:59.491 --> 09:00.757
NOW WAIT
JUST A MINUTE.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.725
NO ONE
THROWS ME OVER.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.458
NO, NO!

09:08.794 --> 09:10.327
WOW, HOW WEIRD!

09:10.394 --> 09:13.628
IT'S USUALLY IRMA
WHO FLIPS OUT OVER A DATE.

09:13.695 --> 09:16.129
HEY, IRMA!

09:16.197 --> 09:18.296
WE'RE STARVING.

09:18.363 --> 09:21.763
YEAH. WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH LUNCH?

09:23.032 --> 09:25.731
IT'S BURNING,
I THINK.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.733
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:36.203 --> 09:38.036
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

09:38.104 --> 09:41.337
OH, THIS KIDNAPPING
HAS ME SO UPSET.

09:41.405 --> 09:44.472
WE OUGHT TO GET
HAZARD PAY FOR THIS.

09:44.539 --> 09:47.506
GEE, I'D TAKE
ANY PAY.

09:47.573 --> 09:51.941
WE GOT TO
PUT OUT THAT FIRE.

09:52.007 --> 09:54.475
I SURE WISH
SHREDDER WAS HERE.

10:00.877 --> 10:03.843
YOU HAD TO OPEN
YOUR BIG MOUTH.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.245
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

10:05.312 --> 10:08.511
I KNEW I COULDN'T
TRUST YOU TO CARRY OUT
THIS ASSIGNMENT.

10:08.579 --> 10:10.980
WELL, IT AIN'T
OUR FAULT, BOSS.

10:11.048 --> 10:13.513
IT'S THIS
FLOOZY HERE.

10:13.581 --> 10:16.281
YEAH, SHE'S
A REAL KLUTZ.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.815
HOLD ON!

10:17.883 --> 10:20.049
I RESENT THAT REMARK.

10:24.185 --> 10:26.084
OH. OH, I'M SORRY.

10:26.152 --> 10:28.552
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

10:28.619 --> 10:30.485
WE'VE COVERED
THE WATERFRONT FOR HOURS

10:30.553 --> 10:31.952
AND STILL NOTHING.

10:32.187 --> 10:35.187
WE'LL NEVER FIND
SHREDDER'S HIDEOUT
AT THIS RATE.

10:35.255 --> 10:38.422
HEY, DUDES, WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE PIZZA.

10:38.489 --> 10:41.322
WE CAN FIND HIM.
IT'S A CINCH.

10:41.457 --> 10:43.956
OH, YEAH?
EXACTLY HOW
DO WE DO IT?

10:44.125 --> 10:45.690
<i>WE FOLLOW THEM.</i>

10:45.859 --> 10:48.291
IT'S BEBOP
AND ROCKSTEADY.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.758
NO DUH.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.426
WHY, TIFFANY,
DARLING,

10:52.494 --> 10:55.927
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU HEARD
SUCH A STORY.

10:55.995 --> 10:57.928
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
MY ONE AND ONLY,

10:57.996 --> 10:59.728
MY VERY OWN TURTLEDOVE.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.596
TURTLES...

11:01.664 --> 11:03.530
ZAP TURTLES.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.664
THAT TIFFANY'S
HOT, HOT, HOT.

11:08.799 --> 11:10.799
THAT'S NOT IRMA.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.232
IT'S SOME KIND
OF ROBOT.

11:13.301 --> 11:15.167
I'VE GOT TO WARN
THE TURTLES.

11:19.202 --> 11:20.302
A ROBOT?

11:20.370 --> 11:22.469
IRMA'S BEEN REPLACED
BY A ROBOT?

11:22.504 --> 11:23.435
EXACTLY--

11:23.503 --> 11:26.137
SOME KIND OF
TURTLE-DESTROYING ANDROID.

11:26.205 --> 11:28.004
OK. WE'LL DEAL WITH IT.

11:28.071 --> 11:30.971
BUT FIRST,
WE'VE GOT TO SAVE
THE REAL IRMA.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.239
PLEASE HURRY.

11:32.306 --> 11:35.607
IF ANYBODY EVEN WHISPERS
THE WORD TURTLE,

11:35.675 --> 11:37.607
CHANNEL 6
WILL BE HISTORY.

11:37.675 --> 11:40.509
YOU HEARD APRIL.
LET'S GO.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.143
WHAT HUMILIATION.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.309
THE FUTURE RULER
OF THE UNIVERSE

11:44.377 --> 11:47.077
REDUCED TO EATING
CHINESE TAKEOUT.

11:47.144 --> 11:50.077
UM, EXCUSE ME,
YOUR SUPREME HIGHNESS,

11:50.145 --> 11:52.512
BUT COULD YOU PASS
THE SOY SAUCE?

11:52.547 --> 11:55.079
I'VE GOT SOME
RIGHT HERE.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.646
OH. I-I'M SO...

11:56.715 --> 11:57.814
I KNOW.

11:57.882 --> 11:59.347
SORRY.

11:59.516 --> 12:00.981
I'LL GET YOU
A WASHCLOTH.

12:03.149 --> 12:05.082
SORRY.

12:05.351 --> 12:07.451
WHERE WOULD
A SUPERVILLAIN

12:07.519 --> 12:09.250
KEEP HIS WASHCLOTHS?

12:09.385 --> 12:10.418
IRMA.

12:10.484 --> 12:12.986
KEEP QUIET
AND WE'LL
GET YOU OUT.

12:13.054 --> 12:14.052
OH, BOY!

12:14.120 --> 12:15.920
YOU'VE COME
TO RESCUE ME!

12:15.987 --> 12:18.387
NOW I CAN GO ON MY DATE.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.122
THE TURTLES!

12:22.223 --> 12:23.488
GET THEM!

12:23.557 --> 12:25.822
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!

12:30.059 --> 12:31.357
NO! LOOK OUT!

12:34.493 --> 12:37.360
HOW ABOUT SOME
EGG FLEW YOUNG?

12:45.164 --> 12:46.763
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

12:52.099 --> 12:54.065
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

12:55.534 --> 12:57.300
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

12:57.401 --> 13:02.201
TRY THESE
ON FOR SIZE,
SHELLBACKS.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.404
OH, THEY GOT AWAY.

13:10.471 --> 13:12.304
YOU EXPECTED
SOMETHING ELSE?

13:12.371 --> 13:14.405
AT LEAST
IRMA'S SAFE.

13:14.473 --> 13:16.805
BIG STORY OUT
ON INTERSTATE 5, STAN.

13:16.873 --> 13:19.906
A SEMI JUST FLIPPED OVER
AND TURNED TURTLE.

13:19.908 --> 13:20.974
TURTLE...

13:21.042 --> 13:22.641
ZAP TURTLE.

13:24.342 --> 13:25.875
I'VE HEARD
OF HOT NEWS FLASHES,

13:25.943 --> 13:27.375
BUT THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

13:27.443 --> 13:28.676
HURRY, GUYS.

13:28.743 --> 13:31.444
THAT ROBOT IS GETTING
MORE DANGEROUS
BY THE MOMENT.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.312
IT'S GOING TO DESTROY
EVERYONE AT THE STATION!

13:34.413 --> 13:37.079
INCLUDING THAT
TRULY DIVINE ANCHORMAN?

13:37.147 --> 13:38.446
I'M AFRAID SO.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.947
YOU HEARD APRIL.

13:40.014 --> 13:42.413
DON'T SPARE
THE TURTLE POWER.

13:51.351 --> 13:54.718
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE,
CANNED HAM?

13:58.653 --> 13:59.853
MY, SHREDDER,

13:59.921 --> 14:01.853
WHAT A COLORFUL
ENTRANCE.

14:01.888 --> 14:03.621
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR JOKES.

14:03.689 --> 14:06.055
YOUR TURTLE TERMINATOR
HAS FAILED.

14:06.190 --> 14:08.622
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

14:10.925 --> 14:11.957
TURTLE TERMINATOR,

14:12.024 --> 14:14.323
THIS IS YOUR MASTER.

14:14.391 --> 14:17.959
I AWAIT
YOUR COMMAND,
MASTER.

14:18.027 --> 14:22.260
INTERCEPT THOSE TURTLES
AND DESTROY THEM.

14:23.428 --> 14:25.861
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO
CHANNEL 6 RIGHT AWAY.

14:25.929 --> 14:27.396
NOT TO WORRY,
BUD.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.829
WE'RE JUST
ABOUT THERE.

14:29.897 --> 14:30.996
CORRECTION--

14:31.064 --> 14:32.763
WE'RE JUST
ABOUT FINISHED!

14:41.434 --> 14:42.333
IT'S IRMA!

14:42.668 --> 14:43.834
NO WAY, DUDE.

14:43.901 --> 14:45.768
SHE'S TOTALLY BOGUS.

14:45.836 --> 14:48.635
OH, NO!
IT'S THAT ROBOT AGAIN.

14:48.703 --> 14:50.203
HER EYES ARE GLOWING.

14:50.270 --> 14:53.003
HOW DOES
SHE DO THAT?

14:53.038 --> 14:55.537
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S KIND OF ATTRACTIVE.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.374
MAJOR BUMMER, DUDES!

15:11.444 --> 15:14.210
TURTLES FIGHT
WITH HONOR!

15:14.278 --> 15:18.011
AND WOMEN FIGHT
WITH HANDBAGS!

15:20.813 --> 15:23.347
QUICK!
EVERYONE INSIDE.

15:23.414 --> 15:25.513
WHY SHOULD WE RUN?

15:27.383 --> 15:29.015
THAT'S A PRETTY
GOOD REASON.

15:29.217 --> 15:31.516
WE CAN'T
FIGHT THAT THING HERE.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.483
THE WHOLE CITY
WILL BE WASTED.

15:33.551 --> 15:35.850
OK, EINSTEIN,
SO WHERE DO WE GO?

15:35.885 --> 15:37.184
I DON'T KNOW,

15:37.252 --> 15:40.619
BUT FIRST,
LET'S CONVINCE IT
TO COME OUT WITH US.

15:40.687 --> 15:42.719
HEY, LADY,
WANT A LIFT?

15:42.786 --> 15:45.653
MUST GET TURTLES.

15:46.888 --> 15:49.988
WE'RE GOING NOWHERE FAST.

15:50.223 --> 15:53.789
THAT IRMA ANDROID
IS USING SOME KIND
OF MAGNETIC RAY.

15:53.991 --> 15:56.758
SO MUCH FOR TAKING
THAT ROBOT ANYWHERE.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.324
NO, WE CAN DO IT.

15:58.393 --> 16:00.625
LET THE ROBOT
GRAB US, APRIL.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.792
NOW WHAT?

16:03.927 --> 16:06.627
QUICK. HEAD FOR THE
ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK.

16:06.695 --> 16:08.461
YOU'VE GOT IT, DONATELLO.

16:08.529 --> 16:09.661
AT LAST,

16:09.728 --> 16:13.329
THE TURTLES
ARE ABOUT
TO BE DEFEATED.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.329
I WOULDN'T
COUNT MY TURTLES

16:15.431 --> 16:16.863
BEFORE THEY'VE
HATCHED, KRANG.

16:16.898 --> 16:18.630
YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE.

16:18.698 --> 16:20.064
TRUST ME.

16:20.132 --> 16:22.498
NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.

16:28.102 --> 16:29.334
EVERYBODY OUT.

16:29.402 --> 16:32.002
APRIL, YOU AND IRMA
TAKE COVER.

16:32.069 --> 16:33.369
WE'LL HANDLE THIS.

16:33.570 --> 16:34.603
BUT--BUT...

16:34.670 --> 16:36.103
YOU HEARD HIM,
APRIL.

16:36.170 --> 16:39.104
WHEN TURTLES TALK,
IRMA LISTENS.

16:39.171 --> 16:40.671
YO, DUDETTE.

16:40.739 --> 16:42.238
LET'S TANGO.

16:44.907 --> 16:46.172
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED A WOMEN

16:46.241 --> 16:47.773
WITH FIRE IN HER EYES.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.774
I SURE WISH WE COULD
FIND SOMETHING TO EAT.

16:50.841 --> 16:53.242
IRMA, HOW CAN YOU
THINK OF FOOD

16:53.310 --> 16:55.008
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

16:55.076 --> 16:57.109
HEY, I'M STARVING.

16:57.211 --> 17:01.110
I NEVER HAD LUNCH
WITH THAT GORGEOSO
ANCHORMAN, REMEMBER?

17:03.513 --> 17:05.346
A VENDING MACHINE!

17:05.413 --> 17:08.613
AND IT'S GOT
MY FAVORITE
HEALTH FOOD--

17:08.681 --> 17:12.181
CHOCOLATE-COVERED
MARSHMALLOW
FUDGE CAKE.

17:12.215 --> 17:13.615
WELL, DONATELLO,
GOT ANY IDEAS

17:13.683 --> 17:16.116
HOW WE CAN STOP
THAT ROBOT?

17:16.184 --> 17:17.348
JUST ONE.

17:17.584 --> 17:18.849
OVERLOAD
ITS TARGETING CIRCUITS

17:18.951 --> 17:20.684
AND BURN IT OUT.

17:20.752 --> 17:23.518
BODACIOUS NOTION,
BUT, LIKE, HOW?

17:23.685 --> 17:25.919
SIMPLE. WE GIVE IT
MORE TARGETS

17:25.986 --> 17:27.185
THAN IT CAN HANDLE.

17:27.252 --> 17:29.654
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.

17:29.722 --> 17:33.121
HERE WE ARE!
OVER HERE!
HEY, ANDROID!

17:33.188 --> 17:34.556
IT'S GONE.

17:34.623 --> 17:36.956
BUT WHERE
DID IT GO?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.790
IRMA?

17:38.857 --> 17:41.124
IRMA,
WHERE ARE YOU?

17:41.191 --> 17:43.792
IRMA, WHERE DID YOU
DISAPPEAR TO?

17:43.859 --> 17:45.325
DISAPPEAR TO?

17:45.393 --> 17:47.192
APRIL, YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT--

17:47.260 --> 17:48.527
I FOUND THIS
FANTASTIC MACHINE

17:48.594 --> 17:50.893
WITH ALL THIS
HEALTH FOOD AND--OOPS.

17:51.128 --> 17:52.427
WHO ARE YOU,

17:52.462 --> 17:53.928
AND WHO
DOES YOUR HAIR?

17:53.996 --> 17:58.129
WELL, YOU SEE,
I CAME ALONG FOR THE RIDE
WITH THE TUR--UH!

17:58.330 --> 17:59.564
WHATEVER YOU DO,

17:59.631 --> 18:01.797
DON'T USE
THE "T" WORD.

18:01.865 --> 18:03.198
THE "T" WORD?

18:03.265 --> 18:04.632
WHAT "T" WORD?

18:04.699 --> 18:07.299
OH! YOU MEAN TURTLES.

18:07.367 --> 18:10.099
TURTLES...

18:10.101 --> 18:11.934
FELLAS, WE'VE GOT
A REAL PROBLEM

18:12.001 --> 18:13.935
IF WE CAN'T FIND
THAT ANDROID.

18:14.002 --> 18:16.736
HELP!

18:16.804 --> 18:19.904
SOUNDS LIKE APRIL
AND IRMA JUST
FOUND IT FOR US.

18:19.971 --> 18:22.871
GREAT. TIME TO IMPLEMENT
OUR GAME PLAN.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.471
WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN ME

18:26.539 --> 18:28.205
THE "T" WORD
WAS TURTLES?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.640
IRMA, YOU'RE HOPELESS.

18:31.775 --> 18:34.508
OK, BATTER UP.

18:39.943 --> 18:41.076
VISITORS 8,

18:41.144 --> 18:42.510
HOME TEAM NOTHIN'.

18:42.578 --> 18:45.878
HEY, BABE. HIT ME
WITH YOUR BEST SHOT.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.480
HA! NOT EVEN CLOSE.

18:49.547 --> 18:51.846
YOU GOTTA DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

18:51.914 --> 18:53.848
SO MUCH FOR THAT PLAN.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.348
IT'S NOT GETTING
OVERLOADED.

18:55.416 --> 18:57.815
WE NEED
MORE TARGETS YET.

18:57.883 --> 19:00.149
AND I KNOW
JUST THE PLACE.

19:00.216 --> 19:02.183
DESTROY TURTLES.

19:02.251 --> 19:03.717
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

19:03.785 --> 19:05.851
ROBOTS AND ANDROIDS!
STEP RIGHT UP!

19:05.886 --> 19:07.518
ALL THE TURTLES
YOU CAN SHOOT AT!

19:07.586 --> 19:09.819
THOUSANDS OF TANTALIZING
TURTLE TARGETS!

19:12.755 --> 19:15.021
TURTLE TERMINATOR, STOP!

19:15.088 --> 19:16.521
DON'T GO IN THERE.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.022
I COMMAND YOU.

19:18.089 --> 19:19.689
MUST NOT STOP.

19:19.757 --> 19:23.357
MUST DESTROY TURTLES.

19:23.459 --> 19:26.492
IT'S CUT ME OFF.
IT WON'T RESPOND!

19:26.625 --> 19:27.525
BIG DEAL.

19:27.592 --> 19:29.558
IT'S GOING INTO
A FUN HOUSE.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.992
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:31.060 --> 19:34.460
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD
DESTROY THAT ROBOT

19:34.462 --> 19:36.994
IS IN THE FUN HOUSE.

19:38.462 --> 19:40.729
HEY, LASER-BREATH!

19:40.797 --> 19:43.630
YOUR MOTHER WEARS
STEEL SNEAKERS.

19:47.066 --> 19:48.064
CAN'T ZAP ME.

19:48.132 --> 19:49.231
CAN'T ZAP ME.

19:49.299 --> 19:51.799
NYAH NYAH
NYAH-NYAH NYAH!

19:51.867 --> 19:54.534
<i>NO, DUDETTE,
LAY IT ON ME.</i>

19:57.169 --> 19:58.569
HEY, OVER HERE.

19:58.603 --> 20:01.036
NO. OVER HERE.
NO.
OVER HERE.

20:01.070 --> 20:03.670
OVER HERE!
ME FIRST!
I'M HERE, DUDE!

20:14.608 --> 20:18.675
WOW. TALK ABOUT
BLOWING A GASKET.

20:18.809 --> 20:21.542
TRULY RADICAL STRATEGY,
FEARLESS LEADER,

20:21.610 --> 20:25.077
BUT WHAT PUT YOU ONTO
THE MIRROR BIT, HUH?

20:25.144 --> 20:27.544
I REMEMBERED
MASTER SPLINTER'S
WORDS--

20:27.612 --> 20:30.478
"THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM."

20:30.546 --> 20:33.779
YOU KNOW, I THINK I CAN REPAIR
AND REPROGRAM THIS THING.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.846
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO DO THAT?

20:35.914 --> 20:39.014
FOR ONE FINAL MISSION.

20:43.050 --> 20:44.982
WELL, KRANG,

20:44.984 --> 20:47.917
IT APPEARS YOUR TURTLE
TERMINATOR WAS A TURKEY.

20:47.984 --> 20:50.185
THE EXPERIMENT
ISN'T OVER YET.

20:52.987 --> 20:54.887
NOW, WHO COULD THAT BE?

20:54.955 --> 20:56.320
ZAP SHREDDER,

20:56.388 --> 20:57.654
ZAP KRANG,

20:57.722 --> 20:59.721
AND ZAP MUTANTS.

21:06.191 --> 21:08.223
NO FAIR!

21:09.492 --> 21:12.758
I DID WHAT
TO THE ANCHORMAN?

21:12.826 --> 21:15.659
YOU THREW HIM
RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.826
WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL HIM?

21:17.894 --> 21:19.694
JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

21:19.762 --> 21:20.828
DONATELLO'S RIGHT.

21:20.896 --> 21:22.596
THE TRUTH NEVER HURTS.

21:22.663 --> 21:26.362
YEAH, AND, LIKE,
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE NOW.

21:29.098 --> 21:31.332
MR. INCREDIBLY HANDSOME
ANCHORMAN!

21:31.399 --> 21:33.132
I CAN EXPLAIN.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.132
NO, NO!

21:34.200 --> 21:36.265
KEEP AWAY!

21:38.100 --> 21:40.034
WHAT CAN I SAY BUT...

21:41.336 --> 21:42.768
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

21:42.836 --> 21:45.036
MAYBE THE TRUTH
DOES HURT.
