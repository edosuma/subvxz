03:44.380 --> 03:46.740
The Hormone Shots Aren't Affecting You At All.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.590
I Hate These Shots.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.100
But I Love Pasta And Sunflowers.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.610
Oh. Okay,Let's Focus. "Slater" Magazine Is Dead,

04:42.510 --> 04:44.500
This Is The Conference Room,

04:44.650 --> 04:45.870
Where We Have Our Weekly Meetings.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.530
The Editors Meet To Discuss

04:47.660 --> 04:49.380
Which Articles Go Into The Issue,

04:49.520 --> 04:51.570
After That,The Freelancers Submit Their Rough Draft.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.680
Fun Fact-50% Of Our Writers Are Freelancers.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.920

Okay. Moving On...

05:07.300 --> 05:08.650
Let's Go,Kids.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.570
Betty,It's So Rewarding To See

05:10.710 --> 05:13.630
One Of My Former Students Succeed As A Working Writer.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.210
Oh,Um,Actually, I'm Still Just An Assistant.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.390
Oh,Well, You're All Grown Up

05:18.550 --> 05:19.740
And Living In The Big City.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.360
She Still Lives At Home In Queens.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.540
Oh,Well,Your Sense Of Style Has Certainly...

05:25.910 --> 05:28.420
Does Anybody Have Any Questions?

05:29.010 --> 05:30.340
When You Did The Paris Hilton Shoot,

05:30.500 --> 05:32.040
Was She,Like, Super Skinny In Real Life?

05:32.210 --> 05:35.110
Yeah,Was She Wearing Extensions? I Don't Really Get Involved In That Side Of It.

05:35.250 --> 05:39.480
Any Other Questions... That Aren't About Celebrities?

05:40.950 --> 05:42.570
Yes,Hillary.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.530
Well,You Did An Article On The Fur Industry.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.010
Was There Any Backlash? Because,I Mean,

05:48.160 --> 05:49.970
You Advertise Furs In Your Issues.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.140
Oh,I Love That Question. High Five.

05:52.980 --> 05:53.580
Uh...

05:53.720 --> 05:55.160
Hillary! Oh,Man.

05:55.270 --> 05:59.060
Whatever. Uh,Um,Never Mind. It Doesn't Matter.

05:59.220 --> 05:59.930
No,No,It Does.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.900
It-It Raises A Very Interesting Ethical Issue.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.080
Let's Go,Kids.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.940
Are You Trying To Ruin Hillary's Life? What? Justin,She's The Only One

06:07.090 --> 06:08.710
Who's Listening To Anything I'm Saying.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.460
Yes,But Lindsay Is The Leader.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.870
If She Doesn't Like What Someone Says,

06:12.030 --> 06:13.590
She Makes Their Life Hell.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.260
It's Like "Lord Of The Flies" In Ballet Flats.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.770
Guys,Look,I Know It Looks Very Glamorous,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.270
But "Mode" Is About So Much More

06:22.440 --> 06:23.380
Than Just Fashion.

06:23.530 --> 06:26.120
It Is About Journalism And Telling Stories

06:26.270 --> 06:27.250
That Reach Out To People,

06:27.400 --> 06:30.170
Not About What Gisele Is Eating For Lunch.

06:30.340 --> 06:33.390
Gisele Eats Lunch? What Did She Eat? I Have No Idea.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.380
Cucumber-Wrapped Sushi, Sevejelly Beans,

06:35.540 --> 06:38.470
Sparkling Water At Room Temp. "Mode" Is Awesome.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.700
<I>Yeah,It Makes You Realize I Totally Need To Go On A Diet.</I>

06:41.850 --> 06:43.990
Who Are You? What Do You Do? Do You Have A Boyfriend?

06:44.140 --> 06:45.630
You're So Gorgeous. Who Does Your Hair?

06:45.790 --> 06:46.760
I Wanna Be You.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.250
Doesn't She Look So Skinny? Yeah,I Love Your Makeup.

06:51.260 --> 06:51.770
Oh.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.470
Oh,Please Be Ewan Mcgregor.

06:55.730 --> 06:58.550
Well,That's Lovely,Ewan, But I've Had Better.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.120
I Hope You're Talking About This Morning.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.440
Easy,Tiger.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.400
Why Not? Only On Of My Organs Is Failed.

07:07.550 --> 07:10.140
Stop It. Don't Joke.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.060
Do You Not Have A Doctor's Appointment Today?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.950
Yes,But I'm Skipping It.

07:15.090 --> 07:17.500
I'm-I'm Tired Of Being Prodded And Poked.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.500
Stuart,You're Sick. You Can't Deny It.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.750
You-You've Got To Go.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.590
I Don't Want To Lose You.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.970
Christina,You Know, That's A Man,

07:32.130 --> 07:33.790
Not A Bottle Of Vodka.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.250
So Introduce Us.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.120
I'm Stuart,Her Husband.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.000
Oh. You're Married?

07:40.150 --> 07:42.230
You Don't Work Here Anymore. I'm Gonna Go And Call Security.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.400
No,I'm Here On Business.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.540
Excuse Me,Mcstraighty, If You'll Avert Your Eyes,

07:47.690 --> 07:50.990
I Have A Clandestine Meeting In The Secret Sex Room. I've Been In There.

07:51.140 --> 07:51.920
Oh.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.710
<I>Oh.</I>

07:54.560 --> 07:55.700
Ew.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.150
Hey,Lady.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.780
Hey,Tramp.

08:04.370 --> 08:06.220
Shall We Have Lunch?

08:06.590 --> 08:08.640
Oh,Are You Playing "Papa, Can You Hear Me?" Again?

08:08.790 --> 08:11.580
I'm Just Spending Some Quality Time With My Dads.

08:11.730 --> 08:13.470
Today I'm Feeling Particularly Close

08:13.620 --> 08:16.710
To Jimmie "J.J." Walker. Dy-No-Mite.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.670
Oh,You're Gonna Find Him,Amanda.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.140
I Don't Know,Ma.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.440
Today I Got A Call From The Private Investigator And-

08:24.590 --> 08:27.080
Dit-Dit-Dit-Dit-Dit. What Do We Like To Call Him?

08:27.230 --> 08:28.440
Dick Tracy.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.520
He Came Up With Nothing. Dit-Dit-Dit-Dit-Dit.

08:30.670 --> 08:31.870
He Was Shooting Blanks. Yeah.

08:32.030 --> 08:35.240
<I>You Know,Marc,Not Everything Has A Sexual Inunendo.</I>

08:35.390 --> 08:38.100
I Come In Here Every Single Day, And I Just Stare At This Wall.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.220
He's All I Think About. You're Right.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.750
As Much As I Like Seeing My Friends In A Bad Place-

08:43.919 --> 08:46.340
You Know,Because It Makes Me Feel Superior... Mm-Hmm.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.880
<I>This Isn't Fun Anymore.</I>

08:49.020 --> 08:51.030
M Gonna Help You.

08:51.190 --> 08:53.600
We're Turning To A Higher Power.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.510
A Psychic? She's Amazing.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.980
My First Time,She Totally Figured Out I Was Gay.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.670
Yeah,So Did The Doctor Who Delivered You.

09:01.820 --> 09:02.430
Because I Said So,

09:02.590 --> 09:04.880
And I Carried You For Nine Months And Ruined My Body.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.990
How's That For An Answer? I Don't Know Why I Can't-

09:09.640 --> 09:10.640
So Sorry.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.300
If You Ever Have Children, Don't Give Them Your Number.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.200
Wait. Wait.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.550
Wait... Wait.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.360
Not To Worry,

09:21.530 --> 09:23.010

09:23.160 --> 09:25.280
Oh,I'm Sorry. Do You Not Want To Hear The Negatives?

09:25.430 --> 09:27.560
Because I Just Kinda Say What I See.

09:28.020 --> 09:31.780
Linda,This Is My Apparently Barren Friend,Amanda,And-

09:31.930 --> 09:32.620
Oh,Linda?

09:32.770 --> 09:35.450

09:35.620 --> 09:37.090
Oh,You're One Of Those.

09:37.230 --> 09:39.480
Listen,I Have A Gym Towel In My Bag.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.720
I Could Make A Turban.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.620
Marc,Psychics Go To The Gym?

09:42.770 --> 09:45.910
Focus. Listen,Amanda Has Some Questions About-

09:46.070 --> 09:48.470
Wait. Hold It.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.680

09:51.300 --> 09:53.570
I'm Getting Something.

09:57.670 --> 09:59.160
Shelley! Mom!

09:59.310 --> 10:01.160
I Said No Boys In That House But-But-

10:01.310 --> 10:02.830
Get Him Out.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.580
She's Good.

10:05.780 --> 10:08.600
So,Um,Do You Think They Got Anything Out Of It?

10:08.750 --> 10:12.090
I Mean,I Can't Really Tell. Betty,They're New York Teenagers.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.270
If They Could Sorta Read

10:13.430 --> 10:15.680
And They Don't Kill Me, I'm Happy.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.470
All Right. We're Gonna Take Our Lunches

10:17.620 --> 10:18.550
Down To The Park.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.410
Come On. Let's Go.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.400
Oh,My God.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.020
Look At Them.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.640
<I>I Am Such A Cow.</I>

10:31.100 --> 10:32.460
Skipping.

10:33.450 --> 10:34.820
Skipping.

10:35.420 --> 10:35.940
Skipping.

10:36.090 --> 10:37.320
Skipping.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.480
Don't Hate Me 'Cause I'm A Guy

10:40.640 --> 10:43.590
And Burn 26% More Calories.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.710
Skipping.

11:00.270 --> 11:01.750
Daniel, I Know You're Busy.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.300
What's Up,Betty? Oh,Just A Little Thing.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.820
We Need To Totally Change This Magazine.

《丑女贝蒂》 第二季第11集</Font>

11:21.360 --> 11:21.990
Do You Ever Think About

11:22.130 --> 11:25.890
How "Mode" Affects Its Readers? Yeah. Women Read It. They Buy Stuff.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.670
We Make Money. We Buy Stuff. It's Circle Of Life,Betty.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.580
Why Do We Showothing But Starving Women

11:30.730 --> 11:32.290
In Designer Gowns?

11:32.460 --> 11:35.000
It's What We Do. Why Is This Suddenly A Surprise?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.910
It's Not. I Know Exactly What This Magazine Is.

11:38.050 --> 11:41.330
But,Daniel,You Should Have Seen These Young Girls Today.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.260
It-It Was Right There In Front Of Me,

11:43.400 --> 11:45.000
<I>And-And I Feel Like I Finally Work</I>

11:45.140 --> 11:47.840
In A Place That Can Do Something About It.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.200
What? Nothing.

11:49.350 --> 11:51.630
You Just Have Your "Let's Change The World" Face On.

11:51.780 --> 11:52.720
Well,I Can't Help It.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.420
Watching Those Girls Today Made Me Flash Back

11:55.570 --> 11:59.540
To When I S A Kid At Leslie Levine's Pool Party.

11:59.690 --> 12:03.730
Every One Of Those Girls Had On Their Tiny Little Bikinis,

12:03.880 --> 12:07.290
And There I Was,In My Oversized New Kids On The Block T-Shirt,

12:07.440 --> 12:09.820
Eating Chips Inside With Leslie's Parents.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.420
<I>So You Were That Girl?</I>

12:13.080 --> 12:15.500
Look,I-I Know We Can't Completely Change "Mode,"

12:15.660 --> 12:17.450
But Couldn't We At Least Show

12:17.610 --> 12:19.520
A Wider Range Of Women?

12:19.660 --> 12:20.680
How Wide Are We Talking?

12:20.830 --> 12:23.270
Normal,Just Not... Death-Y.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.970
I Took The Liberty Of Having Graphics Put This Together.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.560
<I>Now Here Is Average Girl.</I>

12:31.210 --> 12:33.610
Fun-Loving, Great Sense Of Humor,

12:33.770 --> 12:35.860
Just Trying To Have It All In The Big City,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.460
<I>And Here Is What Average Girl Has To Look At</I>

12:38.620 --> 12:40.940
In Her Favorite Fashion Magazine.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.910
No,She's Not Being Coy, Her Neck Is Just Too Thin

12:44.060 --> 12:46.430
To Hold Up Her Enormous Head.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.120
So Average Girl Thinks, Well,I Can't Relate To This.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.510
Should I Lose 100 Pounds So I,Too,Can Be Accepted? Okay,I Get It. I Get It.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.830
Wait,I'm Not Finished. If We Continue At This Rate,

12:55.980 --> 12:59.060
<I>This Is What April's Cover Will Look Like.</I>

13:00.550 --> 13:02.030
Wh-What Do You Want Me To Do?

13:02.180 --> 13:04.100
You Need A Theme For Your Show.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.190
This Could Be It- Healthy Models.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.790
They Did It At The Milan And The Madrid Shows.

13:11.950 --> 13:15.160
Exactly. They Banned All Girls With A Body Mass Index Below 18.

13:15.310 --> 13:17.900
And They Got A Hell Of A Lot Of Press For It. And You Could Even Feature The Models

13:18.050 --> 13:20.830
In Next Month's Issue. Daniel,You Don't Even Know

13:21.000 --> 13:22.270
What This Will Mean To These Girls.

13:22.430 --> 13:26.270
Think Of The Publicity. And Think Of All The Kids Who Will Be Reading The Magazine.

13:26.420 --> 13:29.310
And We Could Get So Much Publicity. And We'd Be Helping All...

13:29.450 --> 13:32.230
You Know What? It's A Win-Win.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.150
Okay.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.170
<I>I Will Go Talk To Alexis,</I>

13:36.310 --> 13:38.420
And We're Gonna Have To Contact The Production Staff,

13:38.570 --> 13:40.730
Because We're Gonna Need New Models.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.410
Oh,And I Think We Should Probably Do A New Backdrop,Too.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.200
Oh,And We Gotta Call Catering,

13:46.360 --> 13:48.890
Because We Can Actually Have Food This Year.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.100
Thank You,Daniel!

13:51.770 --> 13:53.840
Suck That,Leslie Levine.

13:57.140 --> 14:02.680
I Sense That You Are Looking For...

14:03.080 --> 14:04.830
Something.

14:05.000 --> 14:05.910
Okay.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.590
It's A Person.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.100
It Is A Person. I'm Getting Chills.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.560
It Is Your...

14:13.030 --> 14:14.290
Unc-

14:15.340 --> 14:17.510
Bro-

14:17.690 --> 14:18.350
Si-

14:18.500 --> 14:19.610
Fa- Father.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.530
It's Your Father.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.610
It Is My Father. Oh,My God.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.860
Who Is He? Where Is He?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.790
I'm Seeing...

14:28.270 --> 14:30.330
A Dog.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.520
You're Going To Rescue A Dog.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.220
I Already Rescued A Dog-Halston.

14:36.130 --> 14:37.900
He Was My Mother's.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.960
This Is Another Dog.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.940
You Are Going To Rescue...

14:43.100 --> 14:45.780
A Black Dog.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.630
Linda,Forget The Dog.

14:47.790 --> 14:48.900
I Need To Know About My Father.

14:49.050 --> 14:50.710
Marc,She's Not Doing It. Make Her Do It.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.190
Oh. Oh,I Don't Know What I'm Doing.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.220
I Think She's In A Trance.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.860
The Dog Is All That I See. Hmm.

15:03.890 --> 15:06.600
And,Yes,You Will Eventually Learn To Walk Again.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.650
Wh? What? What?

15:11.380 --> 15:13.480
Well,At Least You Got Good News.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.010
Okay,I Want To Hear What Each Magazine Is Up To.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.270
Let's Go.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.600
Daniel,Glad You Could Join Us.

15:23.770 --> 15:26.240
I'm Sorry. I Thought You And I Had A Meeting Today.

15:26.390 --> 15:28.750
Oh,We Did, But I'm Totally Backed Up,

15:28.880 --> 15:31.130
So I'm Hearing Pitches From All The Editors

15:31.280 --> 15:33.000
For The Next Issues At Once.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.650
Have A Seat.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.870
Okay.

15:41.230 --> 15:44.040
Oh,By The Way,Alexis, Thanks For My New Desk Chair.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.690
It Is Awesome. Me,Too. It's Like Sitting In A Hug.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.780
Wait,You All Got Dalton Swivel Task Chairs?

15:49.930 --> 15:52.210
Just A Token Of Appreciation As President

15:52.360 --> 15:53.180
Of A Little Thing I Like To Call

15:53.340 --> 15:56.520
The Global Meade Publishing Empire.

15:56.690 --> 16:00.540
Now Where Were We? I Just Thought The Stupid Chair Was A Peace Offering.

16:00.700 --> 16:01.600
Daniel, Whatever You're Mumbling,

16:01.770 --> 16:03.740
We're Going Left To Right.

16:03.890 --> 16:07.910
"Player Magazine," What You Got? We Got Hometown Hotties,Video Game Vixens

16:08.070 --> 16:09.930
And Ten Pages On Grilling.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.510
That's Boobs,Boobs And Meat.

16:12.670 --> 16:13.490
Fantastic.

16:13.650 --> 16:15.720
"Cucina" Magazine, Make Me Hungry.

16:15.870 --> 16:18.910
Well,I Hope You Like Beets - Wait A Second.

16:19.090 --> 16:20.950
I Thought We Were Going Left To Right.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.940
Oh,Daniel,I Totally Forgot You're Down There.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.830
What's Up For "Mode"? Well,I Think I Found

16:26.010 --> 16:27.680
A Really Great Way To Put Us On The Map

16:27.840 --> 16:31.540
For Both Next Month's Issue And Our Fashion Show.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.620
I Think We Should Start Using Healthy Models.

16:34.770 --> 16:36.770
Like Milan And Madrid? Exactly.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.410
No. Ouch.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.590
What Do You Mean,"No"? Daniel, The Designers Will Never Go For It.

16:40.750 --> 16:44.210
They Want E Attention On The Clothes,Not The Models. Alexis,This Is A Great Op-

16:44.360 --> 16:48.270
Not Gonna Happen. "Cucina," Let's Talk Beets.

16:48.730 --> 16:50.360
Well,I Was Thinking,

16:50.530 --> 16:52.070
<I>"Beet Your Way Into His Heart."</I>

16:52.240 --> 16:53.980
I Rsvp'd To The Breast Cancer Benefit.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.660
Betsey Johnson Wants To Have Lunch.

16:55.820 --> 16:58.380
And Your Accountant Called- Hold On A Second,Marc.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.240
What Is The Holdup Down There?

17:00.390 --> 17:01.810
The Last Time I Was In Stirrups This Long,

17:01.970 --> 17:05.950
I Brought Home A Blue Ribbon From Palm Beach Equestrian. Almost Finished,Ms. Slater.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.619
We Managed To Extract The Follicular Fluid

17:08.770 --> 17:10.329
That We'll Send To The In Vitro Lab.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.740
Oh,Hallelujah. But I Have To Warn You-

17:12.900 --> 17:15.369
We'll Be Lucky To Get One Viable Egg,Very Lucky.

17:15.530 --> 17:16.420
Please.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.099
I Have Plenty Of Viable Eggs.

17:18.260 --> 17:22.150
Women Over... 35 Have Babies All The Time.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.690
Yes,Women That Age Do.

17:24.849 --> 17:27.569
Now Who Do You Have In Mind To Carry?

17:27.720 --> 17:29.490
Carry What? The Embryo.

17:29.630 --> 17:30.910
We'll Cryogenically Preserve It

17:31.070 --> 17:32.940
Until You Can Line Up A Surrogate.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.360
I Don't Need A Surrogate.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.460
I'm In Extraordinary Shape.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.200
Yes,Um, How Do I P...

17:39.850 --> 17:42.440
Medically Speaking, You Can't Carry A Child.

17:43.070 --> 17:46.560
All Signs Indicate That You Have A Hostile Womb.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.140
Hostile Womb?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.810
Aren't They All?

17:57.860 --> 17:59.940
Don't You Ever Do That To Me Again.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.210
First You Make Me Pitch Like I'm Any Other Employee,

18:02.370 --> 18:03.460
Then You Knock It Down?

18:03.620 --> 18:05.300
Here We Go.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.010
You're Just Mad Because I Said No To Your Idea.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.790
No,I'm Mad Because It's A Good Idea,

18:09.930 --> 18:14.430
And You Said No Because It's Mine. Maybe. But That's The Fun Part Of Being Boss.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.910
Look,The Magazine Is Barely Getting Back On Its Feet.

18:17.070 --> 18:19.790
Now Is Not The Time To Rock The Boat. Are You Pulling Rank?

18:19.930 --> 18:21.370
I Guess I Am.

18:21.510 --> 18:23.730
Well,Maybe I'm Not Gonna Accept That.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.540
I Don't Have To Sit There Anymore.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.590
Hostile Womb. Me?

18:32.730 --> 18:33.790
Hostile?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.440
It Practically Has A Welcome Mat.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.590
Well,It Hasn't Had A Welcome Mat Since The '90s.

18:38.740 --> 18:39.890
But I Need To Have This Baby.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.420
Now Where Could I Find Someone

18:42.580 --> 18:45.710
Who's Sturdy Of Frame And Wide Of Hip?

18:45.860 --> 18:47.340
Someone With A Womb As Accommodating

18:47.490 --> 18:49.290
As The Four Seasons...

18:49.450 --> 18:52.200
Someone I Can Control...

18:55.890 --> 18:57.350
Brandy...

18:57.610 --> 18:59.590
Those Names You're Always Telling Stories About,

18:59.750 --> 19:02.790
Are They Your Children Or Cats?

19:02.940 --> 19:05.450
Oh,Those Are My Kids- All Five Of Them.

19:05.610 --> 19:08.830
Five Kids? Five Kids.

19:09.660 --> 19:10.990
Looks Like You Just Found Yourself

19:11.150 --> 19:13.360
A 5-Star Womb.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.350
No,That's Totally Out Of Our Budget.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.790
Well,Then I Guess I'm Gonna Have To Go

19:18.930 --> 19:20.470
<I>With The Cheaper Caterer That I Have</I>

19:20.620 --> 19:22.480
Waiting For Me Line Two.

19:22.630 --> 19:25.700
What? You Know I Don't Have Anyone On Line Two?

19:25.850 --> 19:28.690
Okay,Could You Please Just Give Us A Cheaper Rate?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.670
Yes! Thank You. Thank You.

19:31.810 --> 19:32.810
Thank You.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.080
I Love It When You Play Hardball.

19:34.230 --> 19:36.880
Well,I Don't Want To, But Sometimes They Make Me.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.270
Great,Betty. Thanks.

19:38.430 --> 19:41.750
Oh,I Have Good News. I Pitched My Idea To Alexis.

19:41.910 --> 19:44.760
<I>I Mean,Our Idea... Okay,Your Idea.</I>

19:44.920 --> 19:46.350
Man,You Are Playing Hardball Today.

19:46.490 --> 19:49.560
So... Did She Go For It? Mm,Not At First.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.690
I Totally Stared Her Down,Though.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.250
Told Her I Wasn't Going Anywhere.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.310
I Don't Mean To Brag, But Itid Get Into

19:55.460 --> 19:56.580
A Little Bit Of A Pissing Contest,

19:56.740 --> 20:00.430
And I Think We Both Know Who Has Better Aim These Days.

20:01.340 --> 20:04.550
M- Me,Betty. I Have The Penis.

20:04.690 --> 20:08.000
Oh. I'm Uncomfortable Now...

20:08.150 --> 20:09.150
But I'm Happy.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.290
Very Happy.

20:10.430 --> 20:13.430
<I>I Can't Believe This. I Love Fashion Week.</I>

20:15.310 --> 20:16.260
Oh,My God.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.560
Lil' Bow Wow. I Love You.

20:18.710 --> 20:22.030
Dropped The "Lil'," But-But Thanks,Sugar.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.870
Yeah,You're Reallbig.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.170
I Mean,You're... You're A Man Now.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.080
Nothing Little About You,I Bet.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.720
I Mean,I'm- I'm Guessing. I-

20:31.870 --> 20:33.920
Why Does Everything I Say Sound So Dirty?

20:34.100 --> 20:37.460
Um,Can't Come Clean Till You Get A Little Dirty,Right?

20:38.650 --> 20:41.470
I Don't Even Know What That Means.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.740
Look,This Is Not Good, All Right?

20:44.880 --> 20:48.750
Don't Worry,Mr. Wow. Someone Will Come Right Away.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.570
Help!

20:51.060 --> 20:52.160
Um,Hell

20:52.330 --> 20:54.590
Is Someone Gonna Do Something About That Alarm?

20:54.740 --> 20:57.620
It's Been On For,Like,15 Minutes.

20:57.910 --> 20:58.960
So Annoying.

20:59.110 --> 21:00.440
* I Know You Tired Of These Lames *

21:00.590 --> 21:01.590
* But,Girl, They Ain't The Same *

21:01.740 --> 21:04.240
* You Need A Real Guy Like Boweezie In Your Life *

21:04.400 --> 21:05.520
* The Type Of Dude That'll Splurge *

21:05.680 --> 21:07.000
* And Get You Ything You Like *

21:07.150 --> 21:09.620
* Get Your Hair Done, Nails Fixed,Boo,You Got That *

21:09.770 --> 21:12.770
* Bills Late,Don't Stress, Get 'Em Paid Like That *

21:12.990 --> 21:14.820
That Is So Good! Appreciate It.

21:14.970 --> 21:17.690
That's Actually Off My Brand-New Album,So...

21:18.420 --> 21:20.090
I Think We're Getting Rescued.

21:20.260 --> 21:23.830
Hey-Hey,You Know What? Um,I Was Thinking,

21:23.970 --> 21:27.410
You Know,If,Uh,We Was Here A Little Bit Longer...

21:27.720 --> 21:29.690
I Like 'Em Freaky Like You,Girl.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.230
Oh,I Have A Boyfriend.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.240
Oh.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.390
Are You Happy? I Saved The Day Again.

21:35.550 --> 21:36.700
Hey,You're Bow Wow.

21:37.960 --> 21:38.900
Uh...

21:39.390 --> 21:42.750
Uh,Look,Uh, Thanks For The Ride,B.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.520
Appreciate It.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.480
What's Up? What's Up?

21:47.830 --> 21:49.440
Mm-Hmm.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.380
Oh,My God. Bow Wow.

21:53.530 --> 21:54.960
Bow Wow.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.880
I Just Rescued A Dog.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.140
Linda, If You Can Hear Me...

22:03.140 --> 22:05.000
I Believe.

22:07.230 --> 22:08.740
Christina, Do You Have A Minute?

22:08.890 --> 22:09.960
Henry, It's Fashion Week.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.320
Unless You Need To Be Hemmed,Stitched Or Draped,

22:12.460 --> 22:13.490
I've Got No Time For You.

22:13.650 --> 22:16.410
Right. Um,Actually, It's About Your Insurance.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.670
The Paperwork Came Through Accounting.

22:17.820 --> 22:20.310
We've Been Working With H.R. On Some Cost-Cutting-

22:20.450 --> 22:22.430
Too Many Words. Oh. Right. Sorry.

22:22.570 --> 22:25.710
Um,Well,I Just Thought That I Should Tell You Myself.

22:25.860 --> 22:29.600
They Won't Cover Your Husband For Experimental Procedures.

22:30.490 --> 22:31.840
Oh.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.450
Uh,Well,I-I Figured It Wasn't Gonna Be That Easy,

22:35.600 --> 22:39.100
But I,Uh... Well,I Thought I Would Give It A Try.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.910
I'm Sorry,Christina. Yeah.

22:50.910 --> 22:52.470
Ow.

22:55.210 --> 22:56.560
What The Hell Are You Doing In Here?

22:56.710 --> 22:58.900
I'm Shopping. Cliff And I Have A Big Date Tonight,

22:59.050 --> 23:01.390
And I Was Looking For Some Pants With Butt Cleavage.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.860
Oh... Take Whatever You Want.

23:04.020 --> 23:06.140
Oh. Sure.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.840
Oh.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.490
Oh,This Is Probably About Your Sick Husband,Huh?

23:23.260 --> 23:25.310
There,There.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.730
Is There Anything I Can Do?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.390
Not Unless You've Got $100,000 In Your Pocket.

23:31.550 --> 23:34.340
Nope. All Me.

23:34.590 --> 23:35.470
Thank You All For Coming

23:35.610 --> 23:37.540
For The Official Model Weigh-In

23:37.700 --> 23:39.410
For The Ten Designers To Watch Show.

23:39.570 --> 23:41.290
This Is The First Of Many Positive Cnges

23:41.440 --> 23:42.920
I'll Be Making At "Mode."

23:43.080 --> 23:46.950
Changes Which Nor Women Of All Shapes And Sizes.

23:47.110 --> 23:47.960
Now I Would Like To Turn It Over

23:48.110 --> 23:53.720
To Alexis Meade,My Sister. And President Of Meade Publications.

23:53.870 --> 23:56.600
Uh,We're Very Excited For These Changes... Justin,I Want You To Go Back To Your School

23:56.760 --> 23:57.950
And Tell That Little Girl Clique

23:58.110 --> 24:01.050
That "Mode" Is Using Healthy Models This Year. Please Don't Make Me Do It.

24:01.210 --> 24:04.620
I'm This Close To Being Their First Boy. Wait,These Are Not The Models That I Booked.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.090
Here They Are... They're So Skinny.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.970
The Fresh,New, Robust Faces Of Fashion.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.090
Elke,If You Could Step Up Here,Please.

24:14.410 --> 24:17.290
A Healthy 120 Pounds.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.890
What? There's No Way She Weighs 120 Pounds.

24:20.170 --> 24:24.150
I've Eaten Hamburgers That Look Heaviethan Her. Yeah,She's,Like,102.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.170
How'd You Know That? That's My Gift - That And Accessorizing.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.290
118 Pounds.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.380
98.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.840
123 Pounds.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.090
103. She Must Have Eaten Breakfast.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.310
Over Here,Folks. We'll Get A Shot

24:36.450 --> 24:39.250
Of Elke,The Girls And Me Eating Cupcakes.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.980
Justin, Get On That Scale.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.380
No! I Ate Breakfast,Too.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.470
Justin,Do It.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.980
This Just Added 20 Pounds To My Real Weight.

24:49.140 --> 24:50.580
What?

24:51.040 --> 24:53.320
Oh,God,Me,Too,

24:53.470 --> 24:55.220
And That's Not A Number I Need To See.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.530
Great. I Can't Even Believe This.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.280
Alexis Rigged The Scales To Get Publicity.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.060
What Do You Mean, Your Prices Went Up?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.250
I Just Saw You.

25:04.410 --> 25:06.480
Hey,I Called The Dog Thing,Didn't I?

25:06.640 --> 25:09.770
It's Worth An Extra $20. Give Me Your Hands.

25:13.490 --> 25:15.260
I Know Where They've Been.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.530
Yeah.

25:20.670 --> 25:22.700
Something's Coming.

25:24.210 --> 25:26.460
It's Your Father...

25:26.860 --> 25:28.330
And The Letter "B."

25:28.490 --> 25:30.890
Uh,Benjamin,Barry, Borris,Barbara.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.700
And I See A Kiss. Um,Um,Bloom.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.420
Orlando Bloom. I Get To Kiss Orlando Bloom.

25:36.570 --> 25:38.270
You Know What? What?

25:38.410 --> 25:40.060
You Make My Head Muddy.

25:40.210 --> 25:43.090
Now Listen. It's All About This "B."

25:43.230 --> 25:45.720
Just Follow The "B." The "B" Will Lead You To A Kiss.

25:45.860 --> 25:47.310
The Kiss Will Take You To Your Father.

25:47.460 --> 25:49.830
I Don't Know How Much Clearer I Could Be.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.530
Daniel,I Don't Know Where You Are,

25:54.680 --> 25:55.750
But You Need To Call Me Back.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.530
<I>You Are Not Going To Believe What Alexis Did.</I>

25:58.680 --> 26:00.770
What Did Alexis Do?

26:02.400 --> 26:03.390
Um...

26:05.070 --> 26:08.270
Look,I-I Know You're My Boss And...

26:08.420 --> 26:10.170
Actually, My Boss' Boss,

26:10.320 --> 26:11.420
Or The President Of My Boss,

26:11.570 --> 26:13.120
Which Would Indirectly Make You My President.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.300
I Have A Press Conference To Get Back To.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.940
I Know About The Models.

26:18.490 --> 26:20.360
You're Lying About Their Weight.

26:20.510 --> 26:21.680
I Thought The Whole Point Of This Was To Make

26:21.830 --> 26:25.440
A Positive Change. The Whole Point Of This Is To Sell Clothes And Get Publicity.

26:25.580 --> 26:28.170
But This Is Even Worse. Now We're Sending Out The Message

26:28.310 --> 26:30.990
That These Emaciated Models Are Actually Healthy?

26:31.130 --> 26:32.830
No One Cares About The Models.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.920
They're Nothing More Than Hangers.

26:35.070 --> 26:36.690
And Designers Don't Want To Show

26:36.840 --> 26:39.630
Their Clothes On Fat Hangers.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.890
You Know,We're Not That Different.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.420
Really?

26:43.570 --> 26:46.210
We Both Grew Up Not Liking What We Saw In The Mirror.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.780
I Thought That Out Of Everyone, You Might Understand.

26:48.930 --> 26:50.920
I Know Your Brother Gets It.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.490
My Brother...

26:53.630 --> 26:55.230
You Know What?

26:55.960 --> 26:58.550
I'm Sick And Tired Of Being The Villain Around Here.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.190
<I>Let Me Tell You Something About Your Hero Daniel.</I>

27:02.460 --> 27:05.500
<I>Fixing The Scales Was His Idea.</I>

27:15.890 --> 27:18.700
A "B." Concentrate. Who's A "B"?

27:18.840 --> 27:19.510
Hey,Betty.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.790
Amanda, Have You Seen Daniel?

27:22.500 --> 27:26.380
Ugh,Quiet,Halston. I'm Sorry. He's A Little Bit Racist.

27:26.550 --> 27:28.400
I Hate That About Him, But It Is Who He Is.

27:28.550 --> 27:30.520
Okay,Offensive.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.550
He Picked Up His Messages. He Must Be Back.

27:36.710 --> 27:39.190
Betty,Wait. You're My "B."

27:39.340 --> 27:40.830
I Don't Even Know What Insult That Is,

27:40.980 --> 27:44.240
But I Don't Have Time. I Need To Find Daniel.

27:45.980 --> 27:50.400
Now,Brandy,You Can Pick Any Of These...

27:51.920 --> 27:54.980
Oh,Except For The Russian Sable.

27:55.130 --> 27:56.970
I Shot That One Myself.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.750
Ooh,I Was In Such A Mood That Day.

28:00.050 --> 28:02.820
Miss Slater, This Is All So Much.

28:02.970 --> 28:04.340
I Just Don't Know.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.490
Well,All Your Expenses Will Be Paid,

28:06.650 --> 28:08.350
And You'll Have The Best Of Care.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.090
Oh,It's Not About That.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.680
We're Talking About Bringing Another Life Into The World.

28:13.830 --> 28:17.730
Well,Since I Lost My Fnc?

28:18.070 --> 28:19.590
I've Been So Alone.

28:19.740 --> 28:23.650
And I... I Have So Much Love To Give.

28:26.660 --> 28:29.850
I Think I Need To Do This For You,Miss Slater.

28:30.310 --> 28:33.450
Oh,Uh, Call Me Wilhelmina...

28:33.770 --> 28:36.230
While You're Pregnant.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.780
Oh,Daniel,

28:39.920 --> 28:42.000
Will You Help Me Out With This?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.040
It's A Danish,Betty.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.080
I Know, But I Weighed It

28:45.230 --> 28:48.230
On That Scale In The Conference Room.

28:48.850 --> 28:51.420
Turns Out It's 20 Pounds.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.790
I'm Glad I Didn't Get E One With The Cheese.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.450
Oh,Boy.

29:01.470 --> 29:03.770
I'm Not Leaving.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.630
Alexis Wasn't Gonna Change The Show.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.160
This Was The Compromise.

29:09.320 --> 29:10.690
Compromise?

29:10.980 --> 29:12.590
You Lied To Get Media Attention.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.470
Daniel,Why Didn't You Just Tell Me The Truth?

29:15.760 --> 29:19.570
'Cause The Truth Was Alexis Cut Me Off At The Knees,

29:20.100 --> 29:21.460
And I Didn't Know How To Come Down Here

29:21.610 --> 29:24.170
And Tell You I Was Powerless.

29:24.330 --> 29:28.380
Did You Care About This At All Beyond The Publicity?

29:30.930 --> 29:33.520
It's Okay,Daniel. I Get It.

29:34.330 --> 29:36.650
I Don't Know. I Just...

29:36.800 --> 29:37.960
I Thought That Maybe It Could Be Different

29:38.120 --> 29:39.870
For These Girls.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.950
I Guess I Was Wrong.

30:00.910 --> 30:02.040
Oh,My God. Oh,My God.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.640
"The 400 Blows." "Bring It On."

30:04.800 --> 30:06.460
Um,Let's Keep Looking.

30:06.610 --> 30:08.580
Ooh,Ooh,Ooh, "The Sorrow And The Pity."

30:08.740 --> 30:10.950
"Bring It On 2- Bring It On Again."

30:11.470 --> 30:13.810
Okay,Maybe We Should Just Get Ice Cream. You Know,We Could Find Something

30:13.970 --> 30:14.900
We Both Want To Watch If We Just...

30:15.070 --> 30:18.150
Go In The Little Room Behind The Curtain. No,No,No,No,No. I'm Not Going In There.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.450
The Last Time, We Ran Into My Dentist,

30:19.620 --> 30:21.350
And-And He Puts His Hands In My Mouth. Oh,Grow Up.

30:21.510 --> 30:24.160
We're Two Healthy American Men In A Relationship.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.120
They Can Keep Us From Getting Married,

30:25.270 --> 30:26.860
But They Can't Keep Us From Going In A Little Dark Room

30:27.020 --> 30:28.980
Behind The Curtain. Come On.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.510
Wow. They Have "The 400 Blows" In Here,Too.

30:32.670 --> 30:34.780
Ew. That's Not Truffaut. Ew.

30:35.090 --> 30:38.750
Straight. Straight. Straight...

30:38.910 --> 30:41.320
Military,Military...

30:41.460 --> 30:43.360
Military...

30:43.620 --> 30:47.550
Shaved,Shaved,Shaved...

30:49.470 --> 30:50.470
Manicurist?

30:50.630 --> 30:52.170
There's- There's Manicurist Porn?

30:52.330 --> 30:54.530
No. That Woman With The Whip,

30:54.680 --> 30:56.820
That's Wilhelmina's Surrogate.

30:58.230 --> 31:00.050
Uh,Good News- If She Can Do That

31:00.230 --> 31:01.100
With A Ping-Pong Ball,

31:01.270 --> 31:03.120
It'll Make For An Easy Delivery.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.460
Ew. Ew.

31:05.470 --> 31:06.740
<I>I'm With You,Mija.</I>

31:06.910 --> 31:08.510
Those Models Are Too Skinny.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.840
That's Why I Stay Away From That World.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.140
I Still Get Offers.

31:12.310 --> 31:12.970
Hilda...

31:13.120 --> 31:14.820
The Garbage Man Yelling Out "Nice Rack,"

31:14.980 --> 31:17.410
Is Not A Modeling Offer. I Don't Know.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.280
I Just...

31:18.440 --> 31:20.350
I Thought That Daniel Would Have Gotten It.

31:24.940 --> 31:27.370
In My Day,Women Were Proud To Show A Little...

31:27.520 --> 31:29.420
<I>Trastos En Su Tronco.</I>

31:29.810 --> 31:30.820
Junk In Their Trunk.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.330
Yeah,I Get It,

31:32.490 --> 31:34.920
But No One Wants To Hear Their Dad Say It.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.600
Daniel,What Are You Doing Here?

31:39.870 --> 31:42.160
Delivering Invitations.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.230
"Fashion Gets Real-

I Thought You'd Want Them There,Too.

32:03.850 --> 32:05.000
Ooh.

32:06.830 --> 32:07.980
Wait.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.350
Is This Really About The Girls?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.550
Or Is It About The Publicity?

32:11.700 --> 32:14.560
Or Is It About Getting Back At Alexis?

32:15.590 --> 32:17.440
Little Bit Of Everything,

32:17.600 --> 32:19.860
But Mostly,It's For You.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.560
I Kinda Remembered Being One Of Those Guys

32:21.730 --> 32:22.570
Who Made Fun Of The Girls

32:22.720 --> 32:25.370
In The Big T-Shirts At The Pool Parties.

32:25.530 --> 32:28.970
<I>Oh. You Were That Guy.</I>

32:29.110 --> 32:30.660

32:45.070 --> 32:47.450
Okay,Everyone,Remember, Now This Is A Renegade Show.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.650
We're Not Officially Sanctioned.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.330
If Anyone Asks You What You're Doing,You Know Nothing.

32:51.480 --> 32:56.600
Oh,Can We Have Code Names? I Want To Be Princess Daisy. Oh,I'm Dragon. No,No,Eagle.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.410

32:58.570 --> 33:00.090

33:04.830 --> 33:07.110

33:07.260 --> 33:09.090
Hilda's Taking Care Of The Hair, And Christina Actually Found

33:09.230 --> 33:11.390
Some Amazing New Fashion Designers. Great.

33:11.530 --> 33:14.700

33:14.850 --> 33:16.750
<I>I Want- I Want Real Women Here-</I>

33:16.900 --> 33:21.300
Tall,Short,Young And Old- None Of Those Hot,Skinny Girls.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.180
You're Kind Of On Your Own With That.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.600
I Don't Really Know Where To Start.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.590
Now Come On,Everyone. Let's Do This.

33:29.230 --> 33:29.960
Okay,Betty,Please.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.460

33:31.610 --> 33:33.490
I Will Give You All Of Your Messages

33:33.640 --> 33:35.970
For The Next Week.

33:36.570 --> 33:38.740
So A Psychic Told Me That A "B" Would Lead Me

33:38.900 --> 33:40.360
To A Kiss That Would Lead Me To My Father.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.650
I Think That You Are My "B."

33:44.600 --> 33:47.190
So What,Are You Gonna Kiss Me?

33:47.350 --> 33:48.930
Like You've Never Thought About It.

33:49.080 --> 33:53.040
Amanda,I Don't Know Anything About Your Father Or Psychics.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.820
It's Magic, And,Like Science,

33:54.970 --> 33:56.220
You Don't Actually Have To Understand It.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.480
You Just Have To Believe It.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.900
Look,I Know We Haven't Always Been Close. You Made A Pi袮Ta Of Me For Your Birthday.

34:02.050 --> 34:05.970
Exactly. You Matter To Me, Betty Gonzales.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.990
????

34:08.130 --> 34:09.110
I've Listened.

34:09.270 --> 34:12.110
I Was So Sad To Hear That You Lost Your Father... Mother.

34:12.270 --> 34:13.630
In That Boating Accident... Cancer.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.300
Just Last Year. Six Years Ago.

34:15.449 --> 34:17.260
Amanda,I Gotta Go.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.360
Wait. Your Mother Died?

34:21.880 --> 34:22.840
Yeah.

34:22.980 --> 34:25.239
How Did You Ever Get Over That?

34:27.010 --> 34:28.480
Um...

34:29.610 --> 34:30.920
I Didn't.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.060
I Haven't.

34:34.929 --> 34:36.300
I Mean,You'd Think After Six Years,

34:36.460 --> 34:36.960
It Gets Easier,

34:37.110 --> 34:40.730
But I Still Think About Her Every Day.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.199
That's Really Sad.

34:43.370 --> 34:44.730
Yeah.

34:45.420 --> 34:48.230
But At Least We Had My Father.

34:48.370 --> 34:50.699
You Know, He Really Stepped Up.

34:51.699 --> 34:54.679
You're So Lucky That You Have Him.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.300
Look,Amanda, I'm Sorry.

35:04.840 --> 35:08.180
I Really Wish I Could Help You Find Your Father.

35:10.050 --> 35:11.550
Yeah.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.180
So...

35:18.490 --> 35:23.930
It Was... Weird Talking To You.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.270
Yeah. You,Too.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.400
Oh,Look.

35:30.550 --> 35:32.620
One Of Your Photos Fell.

35:42.010 --> 35:44.200
Gene Simmons...

35:45.210 --> 35:47.160
Of Kiss.

35:47.950 --> 35:50.380
The "B" Gave Me A Kiss.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.340
Gene Simmons Is My Father.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.510
I'm Very Disappointed In You,Brandy.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.270
There's Only Room For One Dominatrix

36:02.430 --> 36:03.630
In This Relationship.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.080
I Do Submissive,Too.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.690
I Don't Think So.

36:09.310 --> 36:12.730
Well,Obviously We Didn't Do Our Homework

36:12.880 --> 36:15.850
With Our Little,Uh, Mommy-Natrix.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.110
This Is A Disaster.

36:18.270 --> 36:18.820
Tell Me About It.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.750
I Had To Watch "The 400 Blows" Last Night,

36:20.900 --> 36:23.280
And Not The Good One- Off Topic.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.510
Obviously We Need To Find A Surrogate We Can Control,

36:26.670 --> 36:29.060
Someone We Can Watch Over Day And Night,

36:29.200 --> 36:32.900
Someone Who Is Desperate For Money.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.690
Get Ready To Kiss Me.
