... rocked New Mexico.
Centred under the desert...

00:39.790 --> 00:43.961
...the 5.6 tremor was felt as far away
south as Corona and Roswell.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.506
- Where are you going?
- Riding. I'll be back in a few hours.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.675
Eric.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.762
Leave the snakes alone today.

00:53.846 --> 00:57.349
They'll be angry and afraid.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.610
I found something. You better come see.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.369
Robert, come home right now!

02:44.373 --> 02:46.500
What do you think it is?

02:46.583 --> 02:49.044
I don't know.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.213
(speaks Navajo)

02:59.888 --> 03:01.974
What did he say?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.560
He said it should be returned.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.272
They will be coming.

03:12.350 --> 03:16.350
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 25 - Anasazi

04:26.058 --> 04:28.143
You bitch!

04:32.523 --> 04:34.608
Beautiful!

04:50.582 --> 04:52.251
Avanti.

05:35.252 --> 05:35.919
Yes?

05:38.547 --> 05:40.215
Ja.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.343
Gut.

05:46.054 --> 05:50.601
Gentlemen... That was
the phone call I never wanted to get.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.564
- Check the bedroom.
- Clear!

06:18.378 --> 06:21.173
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk inside?

06:21.256 --> 06:25.552
I'm not feeling well. I didn't sleep last night.

06:25.636 --> 06:29.598
Really not in the mood for the Three Stooges.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.809
- I don't think we've been followed.
- Who would follow you?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.771
A multinational black ops unit,
code-named Garnet.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.857
Trained killers,
School of the Americas alumni.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.527
Have you been defacing library books again?

06:41.610 --> 06:43.695
They don't want us.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.200
- They want him.
- Kenneth Soona?

06:48.283 --> 06:52.246
- We think that's his real name.
- You've heard us call him "The Thinker".

06:52.329 --> 06:53.789
What did he do?

06:53.872 --> 06:57.709
Hacked into the Defense Department
computer system.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.422
- Why?
- The Thinker's an anarchist and a snoop.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.342
Whatever he got into has
made him a very wanted man.

07:05.425 --> 07:10.264
Customs and Immigration are on full alert.
Every port of egress is closed.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.100
- Why are you coming to me?
- In his last communiquÃ©...

07:13.183 --> 07:17.104
...the Thinker named a meeting place
and a three-hour time window.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.440
He asked specifically for you.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.860
The problem is he may already be dead.

07:32.327 --> 07:36.039
- What happened?
- She shot her husband. Married 30 years.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.418
- Like she went crazy.
- OK, go back to your apartments.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.004
We'll handle this. Excuse me, sir.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.846
Weirdness.

08:23.378 --> 08:28.342
I don't want you to know my real name.
I don't think it's that important that you know.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.636
Sounds like a line I used in a bar once.

08:30.719 --> 08:34.556
I'm sorry about the wait,
but I got this ninja party shagging my butt.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.600
Why? What have you got?

08:36.683 --> 08:41.605
If I'm correct, I got the original Defense
Department's UFO intelligence files.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.984
- Everything from 1940s and up.
- Everything?

08:46.068 --> 08:49.780
- Everything. Roswell, MJ12, and beyond.
- You've read them?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.283
Not entirely. I downloaded
all I could and then I split.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.827
I knew these guys were gonna be after me.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.330
What makes you think
they know who you are?

08:58.413 --> 09:04.211
I didn't take any precautions.
I mean, I didn't even expect to get inside!

09:04.753 --> 09:09.633
They've always denied that these files
even existed. What do you want from me?

09:09.716 --> 09:15.764
I want the truth. And I want you to promise
that those rat bastards answer to the people.

09:37.619 --> 09:42.416
- Mulder, Skinner's looking for you.
- Come in and lock the door.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.295
- Why? What's going on?
- Do you know the Ten Commandments?

09:46.378 --> 09:50.465
- You want me to recite them?
- Just the one about obeying the Sabbath.

09:50.549 --> 09:54.970
God made heaven and earth, but didn't
tell anybody about his side projects.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.473
- What are you talking about?
- The biggest lie of all.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.229
- What is this?
- The holy grail.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.523
The original Defense Department files.

10:06.607 --> 10:11.403
Evidence that the government has known
about extraterrestrials for 50 years.

10:11.486 --> 10:17.326
- Where did you get this?
- Your friendly neighbourhood anarchist.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.832
No. I don't believe this.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.503
This is just gibberish.

10:30.756 --> 10:34.384
Dammit! I'm so sick of this crap!

10:34.843 --> 10:37.221
BS and double talk.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.475
I can't believe this.

10:44.603 --> 10:48.857
- Mulder, this may not be gibberish.
- It's a joke, Scully. It's a bad joke!

10:48.941 --> 10:53.612
I think it's just encrypted
and I think I recognise it.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.157
It looks like Navajo.
It was used during World War II.

10:57.241 --> 11:00.077
It was the only code
the Japanese couldn't break.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.414
- I remember the long strings of consonants.
- Well, can you find out?

11:04.498 --> 11:08.836
- Only a handful of people can decipher it.
- Then find one of them.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.172
Mulder.

11:13.465 --> 11:17.886
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.022
Sir?

11:29.690 --> 11:30.190
- Agent Mulder, I need to speak with you.
- About?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.818
- Agent Mulder, I need to speak with you.
- About?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.864
- In my office.
- Why? Is it another jerk-off assignment...

11:36.947 --> 11:40.742
...where I end up doing
the government's dirty work?

11:40.826 --> 11:44.830
It's about a rumour that you may be
in receipt of some sensitive files.

11:44.913 --> 11:48.333
- I don't know anything about that.
- Agent Mulder, listen...

11:48.417 --> 11:49.877
I'm talking to you...

11:57.843 --> 12:00.554
Are we finished, Agent Mulder?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.723
Are we done?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.188
We're done.

12:29.041 --> 12:34.171
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Agent Scully. Please have a seat.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.930
Agent Scully?

12:43.013 --> 12:47.184
You heard about the incident
here in the hallway yesterday?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.393
Yes, sir.

12:48.477 --> 12:52.898
Do you have any explanation as to
Agent Mulder's bizarre behaviour?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.275
No, sir.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.612
Agent Mulder told me
he was having trouble sleeping.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.366
Do you think Agent Mulder
confides in you, Agent Scully?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.869
- Of course. He's my partner.
- Your partner?

13:05.953 --> 13:09.373
Weren't you assigned to Agent Mulder
to debunk his work?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.792
Yes, sir. A year and a half ago.

13:11.875 --> 13:17.005
I've been writing reports stating the validity
of Agent Mulder's work on the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>.

13:17.089 --> 13:20.968
- Would you lie to protect him?
- Am I being accused of lying?

13:21.051 --> 13:24.888
Agent Mulder has been notified
of a disciplinary hearing.

13:24.972 --> 13:29.101
If there's something we learn then
that you haven't stated here today...

13:29.184 --> 13:31.854
...you may be subject
to the same summary action.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.439
What action is that?

13:34.523 --> 13:37.651
Dismissal without chance of reinstatement.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.989
Is that all, sir?

13:42.072 --> 13:44.366
Yes, Agent Scully. Thank you.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.946
Hello, Bill.

14:25.949 --> 14:31.079
- What are you doing here?
- I've come on some pressing business.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.416
- We had agreed you would never...
- That was a long time ago.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.585
There have been unforeseen events.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.716
No one was supposed to know.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.803
Who could have predicted the future, Bill?

14:46.887 --> 14:50.849
That the computers you and I only
dreamed of would be home appliances...

14:50.933 --> 14:55.312
...capable of technical espionage.
- The files should have been destroyed.

14:55.395 --> 15:01.026
They should have, but they weren't.
Regret is an inevitable consequence of life.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.489
How do you know my son has them?

15:06.615 --> 15:09.368
The man who stole them has come forward.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.079
Oh, God.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.542
As always, we maintain plausible denial.

15:16.625 --> 15:20.796
The files are only as real as
their possible authentication.

15:22.047 --> 15:25.300
- My name is in those files.
- The files have been encrypted.

15:25.384 --> 15:28.679
We have a certain luxury of time.

15:28.762 --> 15:32.933
We endeavoured to prevent
that fact from ever coming to light.

15:35.519 --> 15:40.023
You wouldn't... harm him?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.235
I've protected him this long, haven't I?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.575
He's been provident in
the alliances he's created.

15:49.658 --> 15:53.203
The last thing we need
is a martyr or a crusade.

15:54.496 --> 15:59.168
But if he should... learn of my involvement?

15:59.918 --> 16:03.463
You're your own man, Bill.
You always have been.

16:05.340 --> 16:09.511
But I strongly encourage you in that event...

16:09.595 --> 16:12.097
...to deny everything.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.105
It's good to see you again, Bill.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.691
You look well.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.346
You didn't answer your door.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.061
I took a pill.

16:59.144 --> 17:03.106
- I couldn't find you at work. I was worried.
- I came home.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.027
I must be running a fever.

17:07.986 --> 17:11.740
Maybe it's the threat
of being burned at the stake.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.618
They called me in today.

17:18.789 --> 17:22.542
- What did you tell them?
- That nothing was wrong.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.003
You told them the truth, then.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.758
You opened the door for them.
They're just looking for a reason.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.927
OK. I'll say I'm sorry.

17:35.138 --> 17:39.101
Mulder, these files, um...
Who knows you have them?

17:40.185 --> 17:43.480
- Why?
- Because I had to lie today.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.567
And I put my job in jeopardy
in order to do so.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.319
- If they find out...
- How would they find out?

17:49.403 --> 17:51.655
Maybe they already know.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.075
The question is... is it worth it?

17:55.158 --> 17:59.204
- Is it worth risking everything?
- I'll tell you when I know what's on it.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.833
Now just tell me who I can talk to
about breaking that code.

18:05.043 --> 18:08.213
I'm meeting with somebody in an hour.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.675
I might know something later tonight.

18:11.758 --> 18:17.222
I just need some kind of assurance that
they won't let us hang ourselves with this.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.808
That I'm doing the right thing.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.737
I'll try to find out.

18:36.742 --> 18:39.244
I need to know one more thing, Mulder.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.665
Why did you attack Skinner?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.090
I've thought about that, Scully.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.929
I honestly can't say.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.948
- This is all you have?
- Currently.

19:18.283 --> 19:23.330
There are words I recognise, but you'll need
a code talker to make any sense of this.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.625
I know a man who might help.
I can have him contact you.

19:26.708 --> 19:30.796
Yeah, thank you. Could you tell me
which words you do recognise?

19:34.633 --> 19:38.762
This word... it means goods, merchandise.

19:39.638 --> 19:42.182
And this one means vaccination.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.688
They're both modern words,
which is why they stand out.

19:48.856 --> 19:51.733
Thank you. You've been very helpful.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.454
Mulder.

20:05.163 --> 20:09.418
Fox, this is your father.
I need to see you right away.

20:11.295 --> 20:15.465
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. How soon can you be here?

20:19.136 --> 20:22.055
Fox, it's very important.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.772
Mulder?

21:18.946 --> 21:20.864
- Fox.
- Dad.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.329
What is it, Dad?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.541
Come in.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.800
It's...

21:42.344 --> 21:46.306
It's so clear now. Simple.

21:48.976 --> 21:51.478
It was so complicated then.

21:52.563 --> 21:55.482
The choices that needed to be made.

22:00.696 --> 22:03.240
What choices, Dad?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.661
You're a smart boy, Fox.

22:09.788 --> 22:12.791
You're smarter than I ever was.

22:14.293 --> 22:17.004
About what?

22:17.087 --> 22:19.464
Your politics are yours.

22:19.548 --> 22:22.259
You have never thrown in.

22:22.342 --> 22:26.096
The minute you do that,
their doctrines become yours.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.307
And you can be held responsible.

22:28.390 --> 22:34.813
- You're talking about the State Department.
- You're going to learn of things, Fox.

22:34.897 --> 22:37.399
You're going to hear the words.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.946
And they'll come to make sense to you.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.243
What words?

22:48.327 --> 22:50.120
The merchandise.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.922
Look, I, um...

23:00.005 --> 23:02.216
I've been taking some medication.

23:05.511 --> 23:08.222
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.621
Dad?

23:34.206 --> 23:36.291
Dad!

23:37.084 --> 23:39.378
Dad.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.217
Oh, Dad.

23:50.806 --> 23:53.267
Forgive me.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.142
Hello?

24:35.225 --> 24:38.103
My father's dead, Scully.

24:38.187 --> 24:40.397
Where are you?

24:40.480 --> 24:44.401
They shot him... and he's dead.

24:45.527 --> 24:49.072
Mulder, where are you?
Just tell me where you are.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.328
I'm on the Vineyard.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.663
Who shot him, Mulder?

24:56.747 --> 24:58.957
I don't know.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.668
Mulder, were you arguing?

25:01.752 --> 25:05.464
I didn't do it, Scully.
He was trying to tell me something.

25:05.547 --> 25:09.134
- Mulder, listen to me.
- You've gotta believe me, Scully.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.720
Mulder, I believe you. Just listen to me.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.806
You've got to get out of there.
Leave immediately.

25:14.890 --> 25:19.311
I can't leave the crime scene.
It'll look like I'm running.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.356
- Like I'm guilty.
- They'll suspect you anyway.

25:22.814 --> 25:27.694
You've got no ID on the shooter.
Your behaviour has been irrational lately.

25:27.778 --> 25:32.366
Mulder, can't you see that
everything is pointing directly at you?

25:33.283 --> 25:36.703
- It was somebody else's weapon.
- Mulder, you're an FBI agent!

25:36.787 --> 25:39.915
You have access to weapons
other than your own.

25:41.083 --> 25:44.002
- All right, meet me back at my apartment.
- No.

25:44.878 --> 25:49.591
You can't come home. Someone shot through
your window tonight. Almost killed me.

25:49.675 --> 25:52.636
They may be trying to kill you.

25:55.264 --> 25:57.349
Oh, Mulder.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.894
My God! Look at you, you're sick.

26:02.396 --> 26:06.441
- I'm all right. I'm OK.
- No, come on. I want you to lie down.

26:06.525 --> 26:09.403
No, come on. I want you to lie down.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.989
Let me take your coat off.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.575
We gotta find him, Scully.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.829
No, you have to lie down. Over here.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.682
We gotta find out who killed my father.

26:40.058 --> 26:43.103
Right now you need to rest, OK?

26:43.854 --> 26:45.939
Just rest.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.068
There. It's OK.

26:51.904 --> 26:53.989
It's OK.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.128
Scully?

27:32.945 --> 27:36.281
I'll compare them
when I get the bullet from the victim.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.992
How long will it take
to see if they're a match?

27:39.076 --> 27:43.372
They're both .9mm rounds.
Run the specs. Compare the strike.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.166
We should know pretty much right away.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.306
- Scully.
- You took my gun.

28:02.933 --> 28:07.563
- You think I did it, don't you?
- I ran it through Ballistics to try to clear you.

28:07.855 --> 28:11.441
- Why didn't you ask me?
- You had a temperature of 102 last night.

28:11.525 --> 28:14.695
- I didn't wanna wake you.
- Afraid I'd shoot you too?

28:14.778 --> 28:19.241
I'm being called to Skinner's office today.
I need to give them some answers.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.827
To clear your conscience and your name?!

28:21.910 --> 28:25.372
You've been making reports on me
since the beginning, Scully!

28:25.455 --> 28:30.127
You're sick. You're not thinking straight.
I'm on your side. You know that.

28:30.210 --> 28:33.797
Look. You have my files
and you have my gun.

28:33.881 --> 28:36.216
Don't ask me for my trust.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.385
Mul...

30:49.266 --> 30:51.351
Damn.

31:19.296 --> 31:22.925
I'm gonna kill you anyway, Krycek,
so just tell me the truth.

31:23.008 --> 31:25.511
Did you kill my father?

31:26.386 --> 31:29.097
Did you kill him? Answer me!

31:40.025 --> 31:45.322
- Mulder! Don't shoot him. Just back away.
- He killed my father, Scully.

31:45.405 --> 31:48.242
- I have him, Mulder.
- No, Scully!

31:59.962 --> 32:03.090
Oh, my God!
Somebody call the police!

32:09.763 --> 32:11.849
He's awake.

32:16.311 --> 32:18.939
Mulder?

32:19.022 --> 32:21.900
Mulder, it's me.

32:21.984 --> 32:26.738
Here, drink some of that.
You haven't had any water in over 36 hours.

32:31.410 --> 32:35.455
Your shoulder will be fine.
The round went through nice and clean.

32:35.539 --> 32:38.625
- You shot me.
- Yes, I did.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.919
You didn't give me much choice.

32:41.003 --> 32:44.256
- You were about to kill Krycek.
- Why shoot me? He's the one.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.634
If he is, his weapon is
the one that killed your father.

32:47.926 --> 32:51.096
- What do you mean?
- If you killed Krycek with that weapon...

32:51.180 --> 32:55.767
...there would have been no way
to prove that you didn't kill your father.

32:57.728 --> 33:02.524
I'm sorry about your father, Mulder.
I haven't been able to tell you.

33:05.402 --> 33:07.738
How did you know it was Krycek?

33:08.864 --> 33:13.702
I didn't. I went back to your apartment
to pull the slug from the wall.

33:13.785 --> 33:18.040
But I noticed an unmarked van
delivering soft water.

33:19.791 --> 33:23.462
And I found this in one of the tanks
servicing your building.

33:23.545 --> 33:26.256
- What is it?
- It's a dialysis filter.

33:26.340 --> 33:30.552
It's a device used in the transmission
of substances to solution.

33:30.636 --> 33:35.182
Considering the level of psychosis
you experienced, it was possibly LSD...

33:35.265 --> 33:39.102
...amphetamines, or some kind
of exotic dopamine agonist.

33:39.186 --> 33:41.730
Oh, my God.

33:41.813 --> 33:47.694
- There was a murder at my building.
- Well, it wasn't an exercise in subtlety.

33:47.945 --> 33:51.323
These men are possibly
the same ones who killed your father...

33:51.406 --> 33:56.954
...and who systematically tried to destroy you,
turning everyone you could trust against you.

33:57.037 --> 33:59.748
I don't think I have to tell you why.

33:59.831 --> 34:02.918
I'd gotten too close to the truth.

34:06.004 --> 34:09.675
- Where are we?
- We're in Farmington, New Mexico.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.427
- New Mexico?
- We drove two days across country.

34:12.511 --> 34:15.222
I put you out to let
the effects of the psychosis abate.

34:16.514 --> 34:21.018
This is Albert Hosteen.
He's been translating your files.

34:21.103 --> 34:23.605
You're lucky she's a good shot.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.275
Or a bad one.

34:28.652 --> 34:32.114
Albert was a Navajo code talker
during World War II.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.992
He helped encode the original documents.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.202
How did you find him?

34:37.286 --> 34:39.788
Through a woman in Washington.

34:39.871 --> 34:43.250
But he claims that he knew you were coming.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.752
Last week we had an omen.

34:52.176 --> 34:57.723
Most files are written in jargon, but there
was an international conspiracy of silence...

34:57.806 --> 34:59.933
...dating back to the 1940s.

35:00.225 --> 35:05.272
Albert says that evidence of these secrets
are buried on a Navajo reservation near here.

35:05.355 --> 35:08.859
He says that he'll take you
as soon as you're able.

35:17.117 --> 35:19.411
What about you?

35:19.494 --> 35:22.414
I'm afraid you're on your own with this.

35:22.497 --> 35:26.084
I didn't show up for a meeting
with Skinner day before yesterday.

35:26.168 --> 35:29.171
I don't know what the repercussions will be.

35:29.254 --> 35:31.757
You've taken a big risk.

35:32.925 --> 35:36.094
I was certain
they would have killed you, Mulder.

35:44.895 --> 35:46.980
Thank you.

35:48.732 --> 35:51.443
Thank you for taking care of me.

35:51.527 --> 35:54.029
There's something else.

35:55.614 --> 35:58.534
My name is in those files.

35:58.617 --> 36:03.121
- It's in the latest entries with Duane Barry's.
- In what context?

36:03.205 --> 36:07.000
It's not clear, but it has
something to do with a test.

36:08.293 --> 36:10.879
I want you to find out, Mulder.

36:10.963 --> 36:13.715
I need you to.

36:21.348 --> 36:26.562
- You said you knew I was coming.
- In the desert, things find a way to survive.

36:26.645 --> 36:28.772
Secrets are like this too.

36:28.856 --> 36:33.819
They push their way up through the sands
of deception, so men can know them.

36:34.862 --> 36:37.155
Here. This is my house.

36:45.998 --> 36:48.000
But why me?

36:48.083 --> 36:53.505
You are prepared to accept the truth,
aren't you? To sacrifice yourself to it?

36:53.589 --> 36:56.175
I don't understand.

36:56.258 --> 37:00.637
There was a tribe of Indians who
lived here more than 600 years ago.

37:00.721 --> 37:04.933
Their name was Anasazi.
It means the ancient aliens.

37:06.143 --> 37:08.770
No evidence of their fate exists.

37:08.854 --> 37:12.941
Historians say
they disappeared without a trace.

37:13.025 --> 37:18.488
They say that because they will not
sacrifice themselves to the truth.

37:18.572 --> 37:20.866
And what is the truth?

37:21.992 --> 37:24.661
Nothing disappears without a trace.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.790
You think they were abducted?

37:28.874 --> 37:31.502
By visitors who come here still.

37:50.479 --> 37:54.733
- What's buried out there?
- Lies. You will see for yourself.

38:27.766 --> 38:30.227
It's through those rocks.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.406
It's down there.

39:16.064 --> 39:19.526
- Mulder.
- You're a hard man to reach.

39:19.610 --> 39:23.071
- Not hard enough, apparently.
- Where are you?

39:23.572 --> 39:26.200
I'm at the Betty Ford Center.
Where are you?

39:26.283 --> 39:31.413
I need to talk to you, Mr Mulder.
In person. There are things to explain.

39:31.496 --> 39:35.584
I'll save the government the plane fare.
But which government is it?

39:35.667 --> 39:41.715
Your father may have told you things. I warn
you against taking those things at face value.

39:41.798 --> 39:43.884
Which things are those?

39:43.967 --> 39:47.930
He was never an opponent of the project.
In fact, he authorised it.

39:48.263 --> 39:52.392
- That's what he couldn't live with.
- No. It's because you had him killed.

39:52.809 --> 39:56.146
- We weren't involved in that.
- You black-lunged son of a bitch.

39:56.230 --> 39:58.982
I'll expose you and your project.
Your time is up.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.110
Expose anything and
you only expose your father.

40:16.750 --> 40:20.128
- Sir, we got a coordinate. We're ready to go.
- Let's go.

40:27.094 --> 40:29.179
Take her up!

41:03.505 --> 41:05.591
Over here.

41:08.886 --> 41:11.763
- This is a boxcar.
- Refrigeration car.

41:30.991 --> 41:33.452
- Scully.
- Yeah, it's me.

41:34.161 --> 41:36.413
Where are you?

41:36.496 --> 41:39.291
Nowhere I ever expected.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.376
What do you mean?

41:41.460 --> 41:44.796
I'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.800
There are bodies everywhere.

41:48.884 --> 41:52.596
- Bodies?
- Stacked floor to ceiling.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.724
- What happened to them?
- I don't know.

41:57.017 --> 42:03.565
Mulder, in these files I found references to
experiments that were conducted in the US...

42:03.649 --> 42:08.362
...by Axis-power scientists
who were given amnesty after the war.

42:08.445 --> 42:12.824
- What kind of experiments?
- Some kind of tests on humans.

42:12.908 --> 42:15.827
But they're referred to as merchandise.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.375
But these aren't humans, Scully.

42:22.584 --> 42:25.504
From the look of it, I'd say they were alien.

42:25.587 --> 42:28.924
- Are you sure?
- I'm pretty damn sure.

42:33.804 --> 42:35.722
Wait a second.

42:43.146 --> 42:47.401
This one has a smallpox vaccination scar.

42:50.279 --> 42:54.241
- Mulder...
- Oh, my God, Scully. What have they done?

42:58.620 --> 43:02.416
Mulder? Mulder, what happened?

43:21.894 --> 43:25.731
Move out! Get away from there! You go back!

43:26.815 --> 43:28.775
Cover us. We're going in!

43:28.859 --> 43:30.944
Clear! Go!

43:36.491 --> 43:39.453
What's your name, boy?

43:41.330 --> 43:43.832
He's not here.

43:43.916 --> 43:46.835
Where's Mulder?

43:48.170 --> 43:50.339
- He's here.
- No, sir.

43:50.422 --> 43:52.883
If he was, he's vanished without a trace.

43:52.966 --> 43:56.970
Nothing vanishes without a trace. Burn it!

44:05.312 --> 44:08.023
- Clear out!
- It's done.

44:09.566 --> 44:11.860
Move it! Move it! Move it!

44:34.393 --> 44:42.230
