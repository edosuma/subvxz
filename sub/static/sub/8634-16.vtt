01:48.942 --> 01:53.800
-Why did you do that, Wela?
"I'm sorry.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.474
I have been chasing shadows across
days ago bombardment.

01:57.650 --> 02:01.643
Our world has changed
then you and the mutants came here.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.821
We are your friends.

02:03.923 --> 02:08.053
Yes, but we war women
ports in between your battle ...

02:08.228 --> 02:11.823
... by the mutants
and we will be annihilated.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.900
Fires. What's happening?

02:15.401 --> 02:19.444
It began before dawn,
when we slept.

02:27.380 --> 02:31.146
<i> It has bombed since dawn.</i>

02:31.317 --> 02:35.515
Old trees, destroyed in a few hours.

02:36.122 --> 02:40.300
We had nothing to do with it.
We ... Beware!

02:48.234 --> 02:50.400
Down!

02:55.408 --> 03:00.038
I'll rock you like a blade of grass.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.098
Help! Help!

03:31.044 --> 03:35.900
-It crashed not.
-It is probably something route guidance systems.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.843
And the bombardment stopped.

03:40.019 --> 03:44.683
The mutant which must have kept watch.

03:44.857 --> 03:48.349
Let us find the source of the
This eldbombs attacks.

03:48.528 --> 03:52.794
Together, we can perhaps
stop them and save your trees.

03:53.466 --> 04:02.700
-Okay. But where will we find?
-The evil spirit. The castle Plun-shaking.

04:05.945 --> 04:10.700
Not fair. Come on, Lion-O.
The game is not over, I win.

04:10.850 --> 04:15.900
I can not concentrate.
Something is wrong, I know it.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.819
-Where are tygr?
"He is looking.

04:18.992 --> 04:22.086
New developments in the mutant
war machine is annoying.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.729
We know that they put together two
vehicles of their broken ship.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.162
Is there more?

04:28.334 --> 04:32.134
If there is so
it may be a power issue.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.444
He would not have gone away alone.

04:37.777 --> 04:44.400
-What a horrible place!
"It's not inspire confidence.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.666
Look, Wela!

04:57.563 --> 05:01.900
"It's a ball of liquid fire.
-Exactly.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.200
There was someone powerful
machine that pushed it away.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.900
-Term the in us?
"I do not think so.

05:09.175 --> 05:14.300
They tried maybe ... Or so it is a
programmed defense systems.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.575
We need to find out.

05:17.750 --> 05:23.500
We can never move towards it instead.
They will see us directly.

05:23.623 --> 05:27.555
We take a different path.
What about your balance?

05:36.502 --> 05:40.470
Come on, Wela.
You will like it here.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.579
Come on, Wela. Just a little more.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.549
We still have to pass the
where the moat to reach the castle.

05:59.726 --> 06:03.600
<i> I </ i> need.
From here, I go alone.</i>

06:03.730 --> 06:08.400
-Why? I'm as strong as you.
-Of course.

06:08.568 --> 06:12.900
But I need someone to back
me ... if I can not do it.

06:13.139 --> 06:17.333
And ... I have a trick
that may come in handy.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.800
-Where are you?
<i>-Invisible, Wela. </ i></i>

06:24.951 --> 06:28.300
<i> Then I can get me past the moat. </ i></i>

06:28.454 --> 06:33.255
<i> There must be something in the intake
under the water that leads into the palace. </ i></i>

06:33.426 --> 06:35.519
<i> Wait here. </ i></i>

06:47.407 --> 06:51.707
Did you see that?
It was a blue flash there for a while.

06:52.678 --> 06:56.614
Maybe it was a spark
from the last fireballs?

06:56.783 --> 07:00.082
No, it was in the moat.

07:02.722 --> 07:09.444
The water in the moat containing phosphorus, R.
Is there anything there, we will find out.

07:13.366 --> 07:19.600
You were right. Someone swims in the moat.
A Thundercat.

07:21.541 --> 07:26.501
Shoot at him so he becomes mush.

07:26.679 --> 07:30.581
No, I will use NoseDiver.

07:30.750 --> 07:36.950
I will chew him up
with my rotary blade, yes ...?

07:37.990 --> 07:39.999
Yes.

07:55.875 --> 08:00.141
I can feel drawn by an inlet.
It must be close.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.888
What is hunted in the name is that?

08:44.891 --> 08:49.300
I make myself invisible.
I lost my whip.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.999
Impasse.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.563
Caught.

09:08.114 --> 09:12.881
Open the can and we'll see
what we have caught the fish.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.222
Yes ...

09:17.990 --> 09:23.292
It does look like a Thundercat-fishing.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.999
Take him to the four winds.

09:32.972 --> 09:38.604
I've always wanted to have some time
in one of the Thundercats.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.803
Now I have it.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.482
It's been over an hour,
and no signs.

09:51.657 --> 09:55.700
What is that?
It is his whip.

09:55.861 --> 09:59.500
Has he ...?
Should I follow him?

10:04.136 --> 10:06.696
This is a special widget.

10:06.906 --> 10:11.343
It consists of four separate
spring-loaded catapults.

10:13.012 --> 10:17.555
I will demonstrate.
-Turn the sand bags!

10:20.486 --> 10:22.666
Ready? Watch now.

10:26.826 --> 10:33.600
Do you understand why the ancient called the
This machine: "The four winds".

10:33.733 --> 10:35.888
Secure him.

10:41.140 --> 10:46.168
To show that we are not only rude,
think about this.

10:48.014 --> 10:53.213
When the first sunbeam hits the mirror ...

10:53.386 --> 10:56.480
... it will trigger the catapults.

10:59.859 --> 11:06.666
Yes. It seems that the
will be a clear, sunny day.

11:22.181 --> 11:26.700
-You were up early, Lion-O.
"I was not asleep, Snarf.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.888
I'm worried about tygr.

11:29.955 --> 11:33.322
He may well take care of himself;
right?

11:33.559 --> 11:37.620
Snarf, a friend is someone who
worried about you, who cares.

11:37.797 --> 11:42.777
I would feel horrible if
I did not follow my instincts ...

11:44.370 --> 11:47.567
Better to be Ã¶verorad
than not to bother, right?

11:47.907 --> 11:52.400
We should have heard of him.
He is more than overdue.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.666
Omens sword
give me sight beyond sight.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.333
<i> Lion-O. </ i></i>

12:14.200 --> 12:17.000
<i> Lion-O. </ i></i>

12:17.903 --> 12:19.999
Tygr.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.999
Lion-O.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.333
Here, Lion-O.

12:49.368 --> 12:55.300
"It is tygr whip.
-I found in the moat.

12:55.541 --> 13:00.171
He swam under water for
to find an entrance to the castle.

13:00.346 --> 13:04.500
He was invisible.
I heard when he went into the water. Then ...

13:04.683 --> 13:08.983
A few minutes later,
I heard a terrible sound ...

13:09.221 --> 13:14.900
-... as if something was chewing up.
"I need to get into.

13:15.194 --> 13:21.400
Dawn. It is not good to
try now. We are visible.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.628
The sun will be strong.

13:29.341 --> 13:33.700
It's a long way up.
I only use my kloskÃ¶ld.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.109
It's gone. Condemned.

13:36.282 --> 13:41.500
Ignore it. We must get help.
-Come on, wake up.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.888
Time to work.

13:48.194 --> 13:53.500
-What is that?
-A giant spider from the treetops.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.157
This is called Bushy.

13:56.335 --> 14:01.500
But what will he? She ...?
It ... What to do for us?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.777
There, you see.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.107
When Bushy reach the top,
pull it up ourselves.

14:11.283 --> 14:14.184
"This may well not agree?
-Of course.

14:14.353 --> 14:18.444
This network is as strong
as your klohandske, look.

14:48.954 --> 14:54.500
The Mutant Control Center.
Panthro would like to see this.

14:55.094 --> 14:59.224
What was it with the
where chattering watch?

14:59.398 --> 15:03.391
He said he saw a giant spider.

15:04.236 --> 15:08.434
He saw in his dreams, the fool.

15:08.607 --> 15:16.900
-Is throwing fireballs locked at its destination?
-Yes. It is ready.

15:17.149 --> 15:21.085
At sunset,
we start bombing ...

15:21.253 --> 15:25.246
... the cats lair, yes ...

15:27.559 --> 15:34.900
They sent tygr to spy on us ...
but he failed.

15:35.067 --> 15:42.100
When the first sunshine will become his
separate features of the four winds.

15:42.241 --> 15:48.000
The sun comes up ...
Look!

15:52.918 --> 15:56.999
Send out the guards.
They are on the way to the roof!

16:36.895 --> 16:39.123
There.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.100
Come on.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.333
Jump off at the next floor.

17:02.421 --> 17:06.323
The door leads to throwing fireballs.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.161
Come on. Attack!

17:16.135 --> 17:19.194
By Chase! Look at that.

17:22.540 --> 17:27.099
They have built the thing to drive
of their damaged spaceship.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.907
The idea is the fuel.

17:30.282 --> 17:34.700
-How do we destroy it?
-Very easy, we ...

17:36.488 --> 17:41.653
They have broken into and secured the door.

17:41.827 --> 17:45.058
Melt it down!

17:52.938 --> 17:58.069
We need a simple widget
to destroy the fireballs thrower.

17:58.610 --> 18:03.999
But somebody had to stop and turn on.
How will he get out in time?

18:04.550 --> 18:08.666
-Good question.
-The door!

18:10.589 --> 18:14.025
I think we
need the help of our friends.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.444
You are right, tygr.

18:19.598 --> 18:26.666
Thunder, thunder, thunder!
Thundercats, ho!

18:34.313 --> 18:36.372
Cheetara ready, ho!

18:36.748 --> 18:40.300
-Wilykit.
And Kat.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.782
Ready, ho!

18:44.957 --> 18:49.777
The reactor is started. Ready to go.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.999
"They come here shortly.
Back-to-back, we keep them away.

18:59.104 --> 19:03.999
-There 's idea.
-Thundercats, ho!

19:14.653 --> 19:19.700
Height, 64 ... The reach 22 ...

19:19.858 --> 19:24.200
Then we'll see.
To convert the sixth grade ...

19:24.463 --> 19:26.624
... dual rat and reduce ...

19:29.268 --> 19:33.333
And the sixth grade ...
-Fire!

19:42.648 --> 19:45.555
Come on, Wela. Glide to the naked life.

19:50.289 --> 19:54.666
Your turn, Lion-O.
This was my mission.

20:03.335 --> 20:08.900
I stop him, Slyth.
I melted him.

20:09.007 --> 20:13.777
Do not shoot with the fire in a fuel room,
your a fool. It will ...

20:30.395 --> 20:34.388
Slyth said he would start
a fire that would burn like a lighthouse.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.666
He got through his wish.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.570
I thank you all.

20:46.912 --> 20:51.281
I had not wanted to be separate features.

20:51.850 --> 20:55.684
I'm sorry that your kingdom
I take the first hit, Wela.

20:55.854 --> 21:00.587
But without you, we had never climbed
the castle Plun-trembling walls.

21:00.759 --> 21:05.999
I would like to know.
How do you climb up the walls?

21:06.365 --> 21:11.555
-With Bushy.
-What is it? A hairy baseball?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.222
I hate spiders.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.777
Now you have hurt feelings Bushy.
He likes you.
