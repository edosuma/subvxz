00:00.920 --> 00:02.331
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.040
It doesn't have to end here.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.445
You chose the wrong side, Sean.

00:07.560 --> 00:08.561
That's enough.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.120
- No!
- Arrest him.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.441
Where's Eve?

00:16.640 --> 00:18.449
She went after Bonaparte-

00:18.520 --> 00:19.851
We used the stick to heal her.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.800
And then she Woged
and had some kind of seizure.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.080
Tell me where he lives.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.246
Everybody into the tunnel!

00:26.320 --> 00:27.367
Nick, come on, let's go.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.441
No!

00:31.440 --> 00:33.576
I'm gonna stay here with Eve,
make sure nobody follows us.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.256
We'll see if there's an
exit further down this way.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.725
It's over.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.290
How the hell?

00:41.240 --> 00:42.321
Oh, come On!

00:42.400 --> 00:43.976
We're gonna have to go back
and find another way.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.126
I'm pregnant.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.087
I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.128
I won't make that mistake again.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.808
I guess I should thank you.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.686
I thought you were on his side.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.522
You killed all of them.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.808
You were shot. You're
not even wounded.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.811
They said you were dead.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.730
I think I was.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.851
How does that happen?

01:45.040 --> 01:47.202
I'm not sure.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.966
So Why'd you stop him?

01:52.160 --> 01:53.286
I'm not sure either.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.929
Maybe one of
the others found a way out.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.407
What... What was that?

02:27.400 --> 02:29.004
We got to go back.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.570
Yeah.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.685
We break out, we can
circle back for Nick.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.011
We shouldn't have left Nick.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.128
He gave us no choice.
This fight's not over.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.201
It is for Nick.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.363
It would've been for us
if we had stayed.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.124
I'm not letting
Renard get away with this.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.009
Yeah, that son of a
bitch is going down.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.247
You hear that?

02:51.760 --> 02:53.444
Sounds like water.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.006
There's an opening.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.050
Must connect to
the city storm drain.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.168
Yeah, there's no way we can
get out through there.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.687
Oh, my God! This has
to lead somewhere.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.644
Here.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.810
This could be the way out.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.887
Looks like there's
some kind of door up here.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.925
Oh, my God!

04:13.680 --> 04:17.048
We can get out this way. We've got
to go back and tell the others.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.686
What?

04:28.880 --> 04:31.770
I don't want to tell anybody
about me being pregnant.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.722
Okay. Right.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.336
I guess it's not really
the time or the place

04:37.360 --> 04:38.964
for anything remotely happy.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.690
I mean, why bring it up, right?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.320
We may not even be
getting out of here.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.521
Hey...

04:44.560 --> 04:46.369
We are getting out of here.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.816
I don't need you to
cheer me up right now.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.241
We have no idea how many
people attacked Nick,

04:50.320 --> 04:51.416
or even if he's still alive,

04:51.440 --> 04:52.656
or if they haven't
found these tunnels,

04:52.680 --> 04:54.216
and they're coming down
here right now to kill us.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.730
I mean,
I think I actually need you

04:55.800 --> 04:57.848
to cheer me up right now. Shh.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.684
Listen to me.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.529
If they come down here after us,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.728
it is gonna be their mistake.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.362
Okay?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.241
Come on, let's go.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.402
What are we supposed to do now?

05:18.280 --> 05:19.566
We keep fighting.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.847
Meisner's dead.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.649
Nick might be, too.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.485
We can't do this alone.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.450
We regroup. We rebuild.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.404
Not in Portland.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.841
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm going back for Nick.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.924
You stay here. You
wait for the others.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.285
Lowe him.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.920
Now who's talking?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.490
I am.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:57.120 --> 05:58.485
What's wrong?

05:59.120 --> 06:01.771
I don't know.
Something's in the way.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.330
You're feeling stuff.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.926
No. I won't go back.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.364
What's wrong? Nothing.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.560
Did you guys find a way out?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.001
Yeah, we can all get out,
but it's back that way.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.367
- I'm going back for Nick.
- Us, too.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.323
Hey, guys, we found a way out.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.487
Nick didn't.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.041
There's somebody coming.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.485
All right, turn off the lights.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.641
Now!

06:45.640 --> 06:46.687
Nick!

06:46.800 --> 06:48.928
Oh, my God! Sorry.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.001
You're alive.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.567
How many are behind you?

06:51.680 --> 06:53.284
- None.
- What?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.646
We saw tons of them.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.767
Yeah, they're all dead.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
All of them?

06:56.880 --> 06:57.881
Including Bonaparte.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.405
- You killed Bonaparte?
- No.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.246
Renard did.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.440
Renard?

07:03.520 --> 07:04.521
Um...

07:05.240 --> 07:06.765
Kind of looks
like you were shot.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.964
Like, more than once.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.530
You're not a ghost, are you?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.001
I hope not.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.842
Daddy's going to be all right.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.524
It's okay.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.480
Daddy's going to be all right.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.403
He's gonna be all right.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.811
Yeah.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.805
It's okay.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.446
Is Nick dead?

08:18.040 --> 08:19.201
No.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.644
What did you do to him?

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
Not much.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.761
Is he okay?

08:24.840 --> 08:26.001
He's alive.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.445
Well, then how are you here?

08:27.520 --> 08:28.736
What are you doing still alive?

08:28.760 --> 08:29.921
Thanks for your concern.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.525
You and Bonaparte
went to kill Nick.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.000
Why should I be
concerned about you?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.725
Bonaparte is dead.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.124
What?
Yeah, you must be relieved.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.687
Nick killed him?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.125
No, he had nothing
to do with it.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.400
Then who did?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.403
I'm not entirely sure.
You were there.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.925
How did you not see
who killed him?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
I saw it.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.680
You're not making any sense.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.364
Because none of this
makes any sense!

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
Who killed him?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.608
I killed him. I think, maybe.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.321
I'm not sure.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.360
How can you not be sure
about something like that?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.765
I stabbed him.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.163
I stabbed him, but I didn't
realize what I'd done

09:05.240 --> 09:09.165
until I saw that bloody
sword in my hand.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.576
But you already know
about that, don't you?

09:15.600 --> 09:17.489
I had nothing to do with this.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.776
Do you think I would risk that,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.370
knowing what he can
do to my children?

09:22.480 --> 09:24.084
Has Diana been asleep all night?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.571
You gonna blame Diana
for this, too?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.120
Well, somebody made me
kill Bonaparte.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.685
Just like
somebody killed Rachel.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.001
Who else has that kind of power?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.043
She won't
take Daddy away anymore-

09:36.280 --> 09:39.011
Diana saw the bruises
on my neck,

09:39.080 --> 09:41.128
and she asked me
if you had done it.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.251
And what did you tell her?

09:45.320 --> 09:49.086
I said, no, one of
your friends did it

09:49.160 --> 09:50.640
and that she shouldn't
worry about it.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.841
What are you going to do?

09:55.920 --> 09:58.048
I'm not going to let
Diana control our lives.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.485
If Diana made you
kill Bonaparte,

09:59.560 --> 10:01.801
I'd go a little easy
on the discipline.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.765
Bonaparte brought
this on himself.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.127
He would have killed me.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.966
Maybe Diana just wanted her daddy
to be a hero and save Mommy.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.850
Well, she got her wish.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.251
We better be careful
what she wishes for.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.687
Black Claw's gonna find out about
Bonaparte, if they haven't already.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.487
They're gonna go after
whoever did it.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.608
I assume you're
not going to confess.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.966
No.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.051
But somebody is.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.887
Who?

10:43.480 --> 10:46.723
You should have never fallen
in love with Burkhardt.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.525
Now you're going to regret it.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.928
- Hello.
- Wake up.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.647
Who is this? Sean Renard-
I'm coming over.

11:13.880 --> 11:14.880
At this hour?

11:14.920 --> 11:17.161
I'll be outside your house
in five minutes.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.171
Mommy?

11:43.120 --> 11:46.044
I'm sorry to wake you, sweetie.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.566
That's okay. Is something wrong?

11:50.640 --> 11:53.041
Were you playing with
your dolls again tonight?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.081
Mmm-hmm.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.605
I couldn't sleep.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.569
Why not?

11:59.640 --> 12:01.449
Because of that man
who hurt your neck.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.409
He was mean,
and I didn't want him

12:03.480 --> 12:05.528
to ever hurt you again, Mommy.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.125
Oh, my God, Nick!

12:18.200 --> 12:19.406
Dude, there's so many.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.925
They came here
to kill all of us.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.411
Killed Bonaparte?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.721
Renard didn't know
what he was doing.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.960
He's gonna be trying to figure
out a way to explain it.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.365
You healed me.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.527
How?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.682
It's the same way I was saved.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.530
Monroe and I found this
in the Black Forest.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.125
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.081
What is it?

12:50.440 --> 12:51.805
It's connected with those keys.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.008
It's some kind of stick
thing the Crusaders took

12:54.080 --> 12:55.570
when they sacked Constantinople.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.176
They hid it in a chest
and then buried it

12:57.200 --> 12:59.456
under a church in the Black
Forest behind a bunch of skulls

12:59.480 --> 13:00.536
that, when you turn
the lights down,

13:00.560 --> 13:01.891
they kind of glow green and...

13:01.960 --> 13:03.883
Long story. Basically,
we don't know what it is.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.936
All we know is that it has
some kind of power to heal.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.600
Yeah, you were dying.
Nick used it on you.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.641
And it worked.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.646
Then you had
some kind of seizure.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.283
And when you came to...

13:15.680 --> 13:17.284
I felt different.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.249
How do you feel now?

13:30.400 --> 13:32.050
Something's changed.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.331
Yeah, a lot's changed. I'm gonna
have to tell HW what's happened.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.496
We should probably figure out how
to deal with all these bodies.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.376
I mean, we can't just
leave them here, you know?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.536
Not if you ever wanna have a
dinner party for the living.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.528
Yeah, we have to deal with this.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.856
Well, we can't put
them in the elevator

13:45.880 --> 13:47.564
and walk them out
the front door, so...

13:47.680 --> 13:49.250
The tunnel.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.416
There's a big hole down there,

13:50.440 --> 13:51.720
dumps right into
the storm drain.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.656
What about the three
bodies at the Spice Shop?

13:53.680 --> 13:56.136
We're gonna have to deal with
them, too, while it's still dark.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.162
I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.890
I'm gonna go with them, too,

13:59.960 --> 14:01.530
seeing as I'm the one
that killed them.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.409
Meet up with you later.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.761
So, uh...

14:06.080 --> 14:08.128
How do we get these guys
down into the tunnel?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.256
The hell do you
think you're doing?

14:26.280 --> 14:27.327
I need search warrants.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.361
You woke me up for search warrants?
I need a lot of them!

14:30.440 --> 14:31.496
I don't care if you are
the new mayor.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.936
You don't come here
in the middle of the night

14:32.960 --> 14:34.291
demanding anything!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.480
Bonaparte's dead.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.606
What?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.961
Burkhardt killed him.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.731
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?

14:49.240 --> 14:50.890
And I'm taking him down for it.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.162
How many warrants do you need?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.726
What the hell happened here?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.485
We're not sure, Captain. All we
know is what the jailer told us.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.244
Seven North Precinct
cops were sent

15:14.320 --> 15:16.243
to transport Burkhardt
to the North Precinct.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.085
Somehow, between the time
he was taken out of his cell

15:19.160 --> 15:20.889
to before he got out
of the building,

15:20.960 --> 15:22.724
these two got into it
with somebody

15:22.800 --> 15:25.326
or something.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.481
There were no witnesses.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.370
The rest of us were out on a
bunch of bogus 911 calls.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.921
You know, Captain, I think
it's a little too coincidental

15:33.000 --> 15:34.001
that we got those calls

15:34.120 --> 15:36.122
just when they were coming
to get Burkhardt.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.336
He broke out before they could
get him to the North Precinct.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.361
What?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.770
My guess is
Burkhardt had some help.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.250
Nick?

15:44.320 --> 15:46.322
I want him found,
and I want him arrested.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.481
Put out an APB.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.840
Consider him armed
and dangerous.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.407
Sir, Nick wouldn't do this.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.721
If he resists, shoot to kill.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.486
Yes, sir.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.449
You probably
shouldn't stay here now.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.416
Too many of the wrong people
know where you live.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.576
You stay out of sight until
we find out what's going on.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.251
You guys head back to the precinct.
See what you can find.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.376
We'll call you when
we know something.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.721
Watch your backs.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.561
Oh!

16:22.800 --> 16:24.280
This was on your desk
at the precinct.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.161
Adalind.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.561
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Are you all right?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.210
Yeah. Are you?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.169
Renard was here.
He told me what happened.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.890
He said Bonaparte's dead.
Is that true?

16:35.960 --> 16:37.246
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.004
I know. Renard said he did.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.286
Where is he now?

16:40.360 --> 16:41.805
I don't know. He left.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.168
Nick, I really need to
see you. So does Kelly.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.369
But I can't leave the house,
not with the children here.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.487
Can you come over?

16:49.560 --> 16:51.642
The guards
that were here are gone.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.371
Nick, please, I need you.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.169
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.922
Sorry for the mess.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.359
This one's a Hundjäger,

17:04.440 --> 17:07.808
and the other one was actually
something I've never seen before.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.976
Let's get them out of here.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.287
All right, you get the arms.
I'll get the legs.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.046
He grabbed her!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.121
Eve!

17:21.640 --> 17:23.005
Eve!

17:24.160 --> 17:26.640
She's not responding. She's
in some kind of trance.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.726
He won't let go!

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
He's dead!

17:31.840 --> 17:33.171
Try telling him that!

17:50.880 --> 17:52.450
I can't get his hand off her.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.640
I think I know what this is.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.640
It's a death grip.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.440
- You've seen this before?
- Read about it.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.520
It has to do with
the fear of dying

18:00.600 --> 18:02.250
and getting stuck
in the underworld.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.688
They believed that if you
took a pure soul with you,

18:04.760 --> 18:07.525
you could trade your way into
eternal afterlife or something.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.130
Ah! Here it is.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.924
First documented
by Egyptian Wesens

18:18.000 --> 18:19.604
under the reign of
Merenre Nemtyemsaf...

18:19.680 --> 18:22.729
Oh, my God, does it say
anything about how to stop it?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.404
Yes, actually, it does.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
I don't think we have time
for a complicated spell.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.806
Not that complicated.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.880
Hurry up! I think
we're losing her.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.001
Give me some room.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.481
Oh!

18:48.560 --> 18:49.800
Eve?

18:50.200 --> 18:51.725
Yeah.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.040
Where the hell were you?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.645
I'm not sure.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.326
I don't think you should be
handling dead guys right now.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.606
Thanks.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.163
The death grip supposedly trades

19:01.240 --> 19:03.641
a pure soul
for freedom from hell.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.881
Pure soul?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.127
I don't think so.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.776
Yeah, that doesn't really
make so much sense.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.201
I mean, after everything she did?
No offense.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.520
Maybe this has something
to do with the stick.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.844
Maybe her soul is not as
dark as it used to be.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.480
You know, like she got
her soul cleaned.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.888
I guess we could all
use a little of that.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.776
I just wish I knew what the
hell we were dealing with

19:30.800 --> 19:31.801
'cause this piece of wood

19:31.880 --> 19:33.211
is scaring the crap out of me.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.804
Oh, crap! Those
are the guys I killed.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.451
Don't worry. They'll never
connect this to you.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.090
There are
no surveillance cameras.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.647
I saw you do it,

19:53.720 --> 19:55.000
and if I didn't know it was you,

19:55.040 --> 19:56.201
I wouldn't know it was you.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.043
I'm glad to see you guys.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.122
I was worried you might
be involved in this.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.329
What, in this?
Are you kidding us?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.889
I don't know who's involved
with what anymore.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.724
All hell's breaking
loose around here.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.531
We just got word that North
Precinct was basically wiped out.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.931
It's FBI now.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.096
And Captain's on the warpath,

20:17.120 --> 20:18.531
blaming Burkhardt
for everything.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.776
I don't know what's going on
between him and the Captain,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.643
but it's getting bad.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.896
Why would Nick do any of this?

20:23.920 --> 20:25.001
What are you talking about?

20:25.080 --> 20:26.411
Captain thinks Burkhardt killed

20:26.480 --> 20:27.776
these two cops when
he was busted out.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.928
What? Yeah, and now
Burkhardt is on the run.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.371
We just put out an APB on him

20:31.440 --> 20:32.520
with a shoot-to-kill order.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.206
This is going south fast.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.280
Where's Captain?

20:35.320 --> 20:36.481
He's in his office.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.881
Listen, has Nick contacted you?

20:39.960 --> 20:40.960
No.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.004
Well, I'm thinking he should
be turning himself in

20:44.920 --> 20:48.242
or getting the hell
out of the country,

20:49.200 --> 20:50.611
because I don't want
anything to do

20:50.680 --> 20:52.808
with taking down one of our own.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.524
What's he doing?

21:01.600 --> 21:04.365
Looks like he's cleaning
out his office.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.450
If Renard's looking for a
legitimate way to kill Nick,

21:08.520 --> 21:09.885
you can bet we're on his list.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.284
Renard's on my list.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.044
We need to warn Nick.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.841
Yes.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.407
Are you with Bonaparte?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.520
No.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.688
Where is he?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.485
He's dead.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.641
When?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.165
Tonight.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.525
HOW did he die?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.406
The Grimm killed him.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.482
We were told the Grimm was dead.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.210
He should've been.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.442
Something's protecting him.
I don't know what.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.249
You find out and deal with it.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.561
We have suffered
a major setback in Portland.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.487
It's imperative that you
take control of the city.

22:02.200 --> 22:06.762
I will. Don't worry. I'll
have the Grimm in 24 hours.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.601
Captain?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.444
Search warrants just came in.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.125
Anything else?

22:44.240 --> 22:45.526
Just get ready to go.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.170
Thank God you're alive.
This has been awful.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.687
Did Renard do this to your neck?

23:22.760 --> 23:24.683
No, Bonaparte.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.691
Nick, I'm the one who
told them where you live.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.165
He would've killed me
and our son.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.605
I know. I know.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.522
You didn't have a choice.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.651
Where's Kelly?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.290
In my room.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.881
Hey.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.121
Has he been okay?

23:49.240 --> 23:50.924
Yeah, but I know he misses you.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.525
Hey, bud!

23:56.160 --> 23:57.161
What is that?

23:58.360 --> 24:00.601
An engagement ring,
for me and Renard.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.170
Bonaparte put it there,
and not normally.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.765
He said if I ever took it off,

24:05.880 --> 24:08.167
it would cause
great pain to my children.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.681
I hate it,

24:09.800 --> 24:12.121
but I'm afraid to take it off

24:12.200 --> 24:14.806
without knowing
how to break the spell.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.451
Even if he's dead,
it could still survive.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.882
We'll find a way to break it.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.370
I need to be with you.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.561
And what about Diana?

24:27.880 --> 24:29.041
She's with you now.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.761
I don't know.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.724
I know she wants me and her
father to be together,

24:33.800 --> 24:36.485
but I'm afraid of
what she might do.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.642
You don't know
how powerful she is.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.165
But I hate him.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.736
I hate all of this.
I've got to get out of here.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.046
You can't leave yet,

24:43.120 --> 24:44.690
not until I deal with Renard.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.207
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.121
It's Hank.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.441
Yeah, what have you got?

24:58.520 --> 25:00.249
Renard wants you dead.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.049
We just got back
to the precinct.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.964
He's got an APB out on you
with a shoot-to-kill order.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.725
He's blaming what happened
at North Precinct on you,

25:08.160 --> 25:09.161
among other things.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.528
He wants to take you down with the
legitimacy of the city behind him.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.604
You need to find a place to lay
low till we can figure this out-

25:15.960 --> 25:17.644
Yeah, I'll call you
when I get there.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.688
I think we should stop
using our cell phones.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.760
Yeah.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.371
I'll warn the others. Good luck.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.805
You, too.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.607
If he hurts you,
I will kill him.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.001
You can't take any chances.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.442
But if I don't
come back, feel free.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.170
Where are you going to go?

25:40.240 --> 25:43.084
No, no, no. Don't tell me.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.801
Nick?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.121
He's not here.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.962
Maybe they're still in the
tunnel dumping bodies.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.366
We're losing her, Nick.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.616
I hope that thing does
what we think it does.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.971
Yeah, me, too.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.176
How much do you know
about the stick

26:16.200 --> 26:17.440
that he used to heal me with?

26:18.480 --> 26:20.164
Not much more than he told you.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.208
Does he always carry it?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.004
No, he got it out to help you.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.889
Got it out from where?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.405
Where he keeps it hidden with
a cloth wrapped around it.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.527
Kind of forgot I had it.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.170
Nick left it on the bed when he
got out the stick to heal you.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.568
It's really old,
ancient writing on it.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.362
Can't really see most of it.

26:47.880 --> 26:48.881
Yeah?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.001
Trubel, where are you?

26:50.080 --> 26:51.336
We're in the loft.
Nick's not here.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.646
I know. Is Eve with you?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.721
I'm here.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.285
What about Monroe and Rosalee?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.407
They were headed home.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.050
Monroe and Rosalee are home.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.326
Listen, there's not much time.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.050
Renard's got an APB out on Nick.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.896
He's got every cop in the city
looking for him.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.967
He wants Nick dead.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.407
Now, they'll be hitting Nick's
loft, so get out of there-

27:06.520 --> 27:07.521
Got it.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.367
Hank was right. Here they come.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.571
How are you feeling?

27:15.640 --> 27:18.246
Tired. Me, too.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.761
Mmm.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.245
But I'm happy-

27:25.080 --> 27:26.809
Despite everything
that's going on,

27:26.880 --> 27:29.451
the thought of being a dad
and you being a mom and...

27:29.520 --> 27:31.045
And us being a family.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.560
I know.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.521
Although...

27:51.600 --> 27:53.011
What?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.127
I've just been thinking.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.168
Maybe Portland isn't,
like, the safest place

27:56.240 --> 27:58.561
to raise a family
right now, you know?

27:58.800 --> 28:00.325
I mean, with Renard as mayor,

28:00.400 --> 28:03.085
who knows what's going
to become of this city?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.524
Let's not think about that
stuff anymore tonight.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.807
Let's just try
to get some sleep.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.325
Okay-

28:10.600 --> 28:11.601
I love you.

28:11.680 --> 28:12.966
I love you, too.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.289
It's the precinct.

28:34.520 --> 28:35.521
What now?

28:35.600 --> 28:36.761
Are you with Rosalee?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.604
Yeah-Okay, good. She
should hear this, too.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.131
Okay-

28:41.400 --> 28:42.401
What's wrong?

28:42.480 --> 28:44.687
Renard put out an APB
shoot-to-kill on Nick.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.728
What? He's got search warrants.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.456
They will be hitting
your shop and your house.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.720
Do not try to stop them.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.881
Where's Nick?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.883
We don't know, and it's
better that we don't.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.776
It's the police! We have a warrant.
Oh, my God, they're here.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.290
You stay here.
I'm not staying here.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.456
If they're gonna
shoot one of us,

28:59.480 --> 29:01.000
it's going to be in
front of the other.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.161
We have a warrant.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.090
Nope, that didn't
come out right.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.049
- All right, all right.
- Open the door, now!

29:06.120 --> 29:07.167
Just a second.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.736
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt

29:10.760 --> 29:12.603
and a warrant for the
search of the premises.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.886
Okay, he's not here, man!

29:13.960 --> 29:15.769
And my wife is pregnant,
so take your hands...

29:15.840 --> 29:17.763
Do not attempt to interfere.

29:28.880 --> 29:29.881
Straight through!

29:29.960 --> 29:30.961
Right side!

29:33.680 --> 29:34.966
Going out! Go!

29:42.680 --> 29:45.001
Open the door! Clear!

29:51.360 --> 29:52.805
I think they're leaving.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.686
There are patterns
on this cloth.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.330
Here.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.209
I don't see them.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.281
You don't?

30:10.760 --> 30:13.889
They're right here
and here and here.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.605
I can't see what you're seeing.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.240
I've seen them before.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.766
Where?

30:37.560 --> 30:38.686
No sign of Burkhardt yet.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.686
All these locations
have been checked and cleared.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.842
A surveillance team has
been left at each location.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.002
What about his vehicle?
Hasn't been located.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.081
What about his phone?

30:47.160 --> 30:48.321
It's no longer operational.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.720
He probably took
the sim card out.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.569
He's somewhere in the city!

30:51.640 --> 30:53.768
Well, by now, he knows
it's a full-on manhunt.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.496
And he's not stupid.
He knows how this works.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.285
So he might not even be
in the city anymore.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.160
I don't care where he is. I don't
care what it takes. I want him found!

31:06.080 --> 31:08.447
You chose the wrong side, Sean.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.360
We located Burkhardt's car.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.441
Where?

31:12.520 --> 31:13.760
Laurelhurst.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.202
Seal off the area. Search
every house

31:20.280 --> 31:21.616
block by block.
One-mile perimeter.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.130
Sir, that's not... Just do it!

31:51.960 --> 31:53.121
Oh, my God!

31:53.200 --> 31:54.406
Hey, take anything you want!

31:55.520 --> 31:57.409
It's me. Nick?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.720
Oh, thank God.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.336
You scared the living...
I need your help.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.960
Well, yeah, of course,
anything you need.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.843
Uh, I'm guessing it's
not your refrigerator.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.084
No, Bud. I'm on the run,
and I need a place to hide.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.650
Oh, that's why you're here.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.768
Oh! Yeah, okay, okay.
What do you need me to do?

32:11.840 --> 32:12.887
Do you have a cell phone?

32:12.960 --> 32:14.016
Yeah, yeah, right
here, right here.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.644
Okay. I need you
to make some calls.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.484
Yeah. What...

32:18.960 --> 32:20.564
This is serious, isn't it?

32:21.160 --> 32:22.764
Renard wants me dead.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.920
They haven't found him.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.684
Good. But they found his car.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.966
Where? Laurelhurst.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.121
Nick know anyone there?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.884
Not that I know of.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.324
Griffin.
Hey, Hank. It's me, Bud.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.801
Yeah, hi. Look,
we're kind of busy, Bud.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.565
Yeah, yeah, I heard. I kind
of got a little problem.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.926
What kind of problem?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.162
I think I had
a break-in at my repair shop.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.810
You don't suppose
you and Sergeant Wu

32:44.880 --> 32:46.848
could come over
and check things out?

32:46.920 --> 32:47.967
Because the perp...

32:48.040 --> 32:50.008
Uh, that's what you call them, right?
Uh-huh-

32:50.080 --> 32:51.411
Could still be in there.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.244
I mean, what if he was
a wanted man?

32:54.800 --> 32:57.565
Yeah, yeah, that could be dangerous.
We're on our way.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.562
You might wanna
change your clothes.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.127
They're here.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.522
But they took a cab.
Why would they take a cab?

33:22.520 --> 33:24.136
You took a cab so you
wouldn't be followed, right?

33:24.160 --> 33:26.296
Two cabs, one train, a little walking.
Not in that order.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.890
Where is he? This way.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.206
They put a tail on you?

33:31.320 --> 33:32.526
They did. We lost it.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.601
We were followed, too,

33:33.680 --> 33:35.376
but I'm pretty sure we lost
them in a bar downtown.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.240
Yeah, they were watching
the loft when we left.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.611
You left your car
in Laurelhurst.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.841
Last night.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.296
They are searching
the hell out of that area.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.840
That should keep
them busy for a while.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.246
We contacted HW.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.526
Is anyone still alive?

33:45.600 --> 33:46.647
Not here in Portland.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.609
But Black Claw was badly
compromised here, too.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.841
Renard is on his own.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.416
Yeah, that'll make it
easier for us to kill him.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.602
Not really. He's got cops
with him day and night.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.886
So what do we do about Nick?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.530
I think he has to
leave Portland.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.329
Renard won't stop
until you're dead.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.176
Then maybe that's
what you have to do.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.441
If I leave Portland, Renard
will control everything.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.776
Nick, we can't afford
to lose you.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.256
Look, we need to think
of some place safe,

34:05.280 --> 34:07.009
and obviously
it's not here, so...

34:08.040 --> 34:09.616
I hate to say this, Nick,
but maybe they're right.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.130
Maybe you've got to go.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.679
You should go back
to the precinct.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.096
Get back to work
like everything's normal.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.496
I don't want you
getting drawn into this

34:18.520 --> 34:19.616
any more than you already have.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.563
I don't like it, but okay.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.563
We're still searching
the Laurelhurst area,

34:23.639 --> 34:25.085
but so far we got nothing.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.606
We've already checked several
blocks away from the parked car.

34:27.679 --> 34:30.159
He dumped it there
for us to find.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.481
Captain? Yeah?

34:32.560 --> 34:34.440
We've run every incoming
and outgoing phone call

34:34.480 --> 34:35.925
on Burkhardt's cell phone.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.496
Besides the ones
we've already checked,

34:37.520 --> 34:39.735
there's only one other number
that has any kind of frequency.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.886
What is it?

34:40.960 --> 34:42.246
Probably doesn't mean anything.

34:42.320 --> 34:46.166
We checked it out. It's a refrigerator
repair company owned by a...

34:46.239 --> 34:47.286
Bud Wurstner.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.168
Yeah, that's him.

34:49.239 --> 34:50.924
Check his house.
Check his repair shop.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.684
I want teams
at both places, now!

35:00.840 --> 35:02.604
We're moving teams
from here to here.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.444
What do you want us
to do when...

35:04.520 --> 35:06.090
I don't like the look of that.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.416
How do we stop
that son of a bitch?

35:07.440 --> 35:09.966
There's always a bullet.
I'm sort of half-joking.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.201
I'm sort of half-laughing.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.964
Something's going on.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.008
Well, that something's
coming at us.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.245
I know you know
where Burkhardt is.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.609
I will find him.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.216
And if either one of you gets in
my way, I'm coming for you next.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.402
And we won't be hard to find.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.881
If he finds Nick,

35:42.960 --> 35:44.136
they're not gonna
be bringing him in.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.642
Renard wants
uniforms to do his killing for him.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.769
Griffin. Where?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.691
Yeah, white female body.
Uh-huh. Yeah, I got it.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.047
Got a body ID'ed as Rachel Wood.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.201
Rachel Wood?

35:59.760 --> 36:02.240
Yeah. I think you should
come with me on this one.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.336
We need to be watching our
backs for the time being.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.930
I mean, we could
take you in our car,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.896
but if they're watching us,
they're watching our car.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.331
Why not just steal one?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.004
'Cause there's
a risk in that, too.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.048
- What about Bud?
- Right.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.691
What? What, what...
What about me?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.250
Your truck. You're off the grid.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.486
Hmm. For now.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.760
Any chance we can see what
vehicles the police are tracking?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.080
Whatever car they put a BOLO on

36:23.120 --> 36:24.360
should be in the system.

36:24.440 --> 36:25.851
Can you get into the system?

36:26.720 --> 36:28.210
If I access it, they'll know.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.281
Wu could help,

36:29.360 --> 36:31.096
but somebody else is going
to have to make that call.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.088
I'll call Wu. Nobody
can track my phone.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.165
Do you know what these mean?

36:39.200 --> 36:40.281
No.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.010
When I was with
Monroe and Rosalee,

36:42.080 --> 36:43.684
I touched one of
the Black Claw bodies.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.364
Oh, yeah, right, that was fun.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.727
First time I've ever seen
a death grip from a dead guy.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.882
I saw these symbols on his
face when I was there

36:50.960 --> 36:52.325
and also on the cloth.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.811
Maybe there was more on that
cloth than we could see.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.404
Do you still have
the stick with you?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.481
Yes.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.244
I'm not sure you should
be carrying it all the time.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.804
Ms. Wood's cc-worker grew
concerned when he couldn't reach her.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.451
He came over
and discovered this.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.926
All right.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.091
Bring in CSU. Get this
whole place fingerprinted.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.406
She was Renard's
campaign PR person.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.450
Yeah.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.016
When you're murdered in bed,

37:33.040 --> 37:35.725
it's usually by
someone you know.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.851
274, go ahead.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.523
This is Unit 274 near the
corner of Marks, Milwaukee.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.931
Just completed a drive-by.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.765
There's one truck parked in front.
Belongs to the company.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.327
No sign of the suspect. No activity
at the exterior of the premises.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.960
We're going to have to
send somebody in.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.131
This is not good.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.056
There are BOLOs out on
Monroe and Rosalee's cars,

38:09.080 --> 38:11.082
your car, and mine, and Bud's.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.124
Bud's on the list? Yep, and a
BOLO just came back on his truck.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.200
It's at his shop.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.368
Son of a bitch!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.084
We need to get Nick
out of there now.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.161
Call Trubel.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.721
On it.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.120
Oh, geez! Oh, geez!

38:24.200 --> 38:25.804
Someone's at... Somebody's here.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.564
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I...

38:27.640 --> 38:29.404
Bud. Just calm down.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.488
Probably just a customer.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.562
Why don't you go
find out what they want?

38:33.640 --> 38:34.766
Right. Right.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.809
Business as usual.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.120
Okay-

38:38.240 --> 38:39.321
Wu.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.083
Okay, yeah, I'll put
you on speaker.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.607
They know about Bud.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.776
They put a BOLO out on his truck.
It's in front of his shop.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.246
They're watching it. Nick, you've
got to get out of there now.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.970
Got it. Thanks.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.008
Check in with you when we can.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.128
I'm gonna find out if
Tactical is making a move.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.248
Check with Franco. Yep.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.005
Well, looks clear.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.761
Oh, I hate that. What?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.696
Oh, you know, people coming
in here with a problem,

39:10.720 --> 39:13.136
asking me how much it's gonna cost
to repair their refrigerator,

39:13.160 --> 39:15.376
and they don't even know what
kind of refrigerator they've got!

39:15.400 --> 39:18.449
Bud, I don't think that was a customer.
That was a cop.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.521
Oh, God!

39:19.600 --> 39:21.090
They're watching the shop.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.969
Nick, you've got to
get out of here, now.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.451
We need a diversion.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.560
If they think I'm in here,

39:25.600 --> 39:26.920
they're gonna send in
a SERT team.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.530
Bud. Huh?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.563
Back your truck
into the loading bay.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.643
Help him load in a freezer.
BU DI What? Why?

39:34.720 --> 39:36.006
So they think you're in it.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.285
Bud. What?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.046
You're the diversion.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.964
Right, right, right.
They follow me.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.776
Uh, hey, you could fit in that one
if you were going to fit in one.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.840
I haven't fixed it yet, but, uh... But
I guess that doesn't matter right now.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.291
I don't see anybody.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.646
You won't.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
Franco.

40:00.640 --> 40:01.766
Hey. It's Wu. Where are you?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.443
Captain ordered me
not to talk to you guys.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.010
Captain's out of control.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.686
Seems like,
but he's still got rank.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.529
I've got to ask you something.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.520
Drew, you're putting me
in a tough spot here.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.456
Okay, then you don't need to.
I'm gonna give you an address.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.369
If that's where you are,
don't say anything.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.124
4046 Marks.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.004
Thanks.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.970
SERT team has been
ordered to Bud's shop.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.296
Franco's there. It's going down.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.685
What the hell are we gonna do?

40:36.480 --> 40:37.891
Wish I knew.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.841
We ran the fingerprints from
the Rachel Wood apartment.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.122
This is where it gets
a little awkward.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.496
Well, that's why
I brought it up personally.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.160
What kind of awkward
are we talking about?

40:52.920 --> 40:55.890
Captain Renard's fingerprints
are all over that place.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.480
I know she was working
on his campaign.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.921
I think she was
working on something else.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.047
All right.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.890
Okay. Okay.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.445
Okay!

41:24.720 --> 41:25.721
Phew!

41:41.120 --> 41:43.691
Suspect's vehicle just
pulled into the loading bay.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.967
They loaded in a freezer
big enough to hold a man.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.691
They're getting ready to go.
Get in position.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.171
Nick! Nick, we're too late!

41:50.240 --> 41:52.322
They've surrounded the place.
We're all gonna die!

41:56.360 --> 41:57.805
Isn't there
something you could do?

41:57.880 --> 41:59.530
I can try.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.521
Eve!

42:08.480 --> 42:10.084
I'm so sorry, Nick.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.770
We're in position, sir.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.525
Take them down.
