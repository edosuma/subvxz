04:17.190 --> 04:18.390
OF COURSE IT IS.

AND HUNGRY.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.380
OH. SO THIS IS MY CREW?

07:28.382 --> 07:32.751
YOU GET A LITTLE TIRED
AND A WEE BIT HUNGRY...

07:32.753 --> 07:35.787
AND YOU WANT
TO SHOVE OFF FOR HOME.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.823
ARRGH. THAT SICKENS ME.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.560
A PIRATE IS NOT JUDGED
BY THE NOTCHES IN HIS CUTLASS

07:41.562 --> 07:42.761
OR THE SIZE OF HIS BOOTY.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.465
A PIRATE IS JUDGED
BY THE LOYALTY OF HIS CREW

07:46.467 --> 07:48.667
AND WITHOUT
A LOYAL CREW

07:48.669 --> 07:50.535
WHAT AM I CAPTAIN OF?

07:50.537 --> 07:52.070
JUST A BUNCH OF SAND.

YOUR LOYAL CREW.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.112

08:01.482 --> 08:02.814
YOU'LL STAY WITH ME, THEN?

WE'LL BE THE MOST LOYAL
PIRATE CREW EVER!

08:07.254 --> 08:10.589
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU, BOYS.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.990
ONE FOR ALL...

08:11.992 --> 08:13.792
AND ALL
FOR ONE!

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
I'M SO LOYAL

08:15.796 --> 08:20.232
I DON'T EVEN MIND SLEEPING
ON THE COLD, HARD GROUND

08:20.234 --> 08:25.170
WHILE CAPTAIN KRABS
SLEEPS IN HIS WARM, DRY TENT.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.238
I'M SO LOYAL

08:26.240 --> 08:28.139
I HAVEN'T
BATHED IN WEEKS.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.142
BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT
FOR A FEW HOURS.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.210
I KNOW...

08:32.212 --> 08:33.078
(<i> snickering</i> )

08:33.080 --> 08:35.212
I'M SO LOYAL,
I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP

08:35.215 --> 08:36.581
TILL WE FIND
THE TREASURE.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.950
