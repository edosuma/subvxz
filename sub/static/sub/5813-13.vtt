00:03.504 --> 00:05.552
- It's Halloween, man.
- For us, every day is Halloween.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.263
Samhain is the damn origin
of Halloween.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.894
Celts believe that October 31st
was the one night of the year

00:11.053 --> 00:12.771
when the veil was thinnest
between the living and the dead.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.398
- We should have one this year.
- Have one, what?

00:14.556 --> 00:15.557
A Christmas.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.107
Ah, we'll get a tree,
a little Boston Market.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.511
Just like when we were little.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.278
It's Valentine's Day.
Your favorite holiday, remember?

00:23.440 --> 00:26.034
I mean, what you always call it,
"Unattached Drifter Christmas"?

00:26.193 --> 00:29.367
Your people call them cupid.
He's actually a lower order of angel.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.130
Technically, it's a cherub, third class.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.624
Yes. yes, yes!

00:32.783 --> 00:35.582
- Is this a fight? Are we gonna fight?
- This is their handshake.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.745
What was that?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.289
The future. We're bonded.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.008
- You're the one who set me free.
- No, that was an accident.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.757
- You and I will be together.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.547
We will become one.
Why wouldn't you want that?

01:11.280 --> 01:13.032
Here, honey. Let me.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.460
Thanks, babe.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.329
As handsome as the day I met you.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.887
Doesn't Staci know to knock?
She'll wake Teagan!

01:37.264 --> 01:39.892
Sorry. I remembered after I rang.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.488
So, where is Melissa?

01:49.401 --> 01:50.744
She's getting ready.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.625
Ew. I can taste her mom lipstick.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.231
You're telling her tonight, right?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.708
- It's Valentine's Day.
- So?

02:04.875 --> 02:07.219
So, that's heartless.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.801
- Can't we talk about this later?
- Iâ€™m tired of waiting.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.475
Look, I told you, it's not that simple.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.264
Mel and I, we've been together
since we were your age.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.899
We have a house. A baby.
We have a whole life together.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.857
Dan! Don't you get it? That's what I want.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.111
- Either tell her tonight, or...
- Or what?

02:29.900 --> 02:33.245
Melissa! You look so pretty!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.997
I love your lipstick.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.158
Thanks. You ready?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.409
Mmm-hmm.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.625
I would like to apologize
for being so insensitive...

04:02.909 --> 04:04.331
You scared the hell out of me.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.332
What are you doing here?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.590
Mmm. That feels good.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.208
Morning.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
Mmm.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.308
Is that a hickey?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.315
And?

05:12.395 --> 05:13.612
It was Valentine's Day.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.743
- Well...
- Can't help it if I'm a hopeless romantic.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.582
You got half of that right.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.031
Just doing my civic duty.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.580
Helping all the single ladies.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.881
You know, the best thing
about February 14th?

05:31.081 --> 05:34.130
You don't have to be Mr. Right.
Just Mr. Right Now.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.754
It's classy.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.380
Yeah. What'd you do, judgy?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.058
Curl up in your Snuggie?
Watch Fifty Shades on cable?

05:42.217 --> 05:44.060
Yeah... No.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.932
Check this out.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.100
Staci Altman, 19-year-old babysitter

05:50.267 --> 05:52.690
from Hudson, Ohio,
was murdered last night.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.947
Well, that blows.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.241
But if her name's not Amara...

05:59.192 --> 06:00.193
How is that us?

06:00.569 --> 06:02.947
Because her heart was ripped out.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.623
- On Valentine's Day? Mmm.
- Yeah.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.495
Was it like an ironic werewolf?

06:10.328 --> 06:13.298
All right. Let's check it out.
But, first, I need bacon.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.675
No, first, you need a shower.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.545
- Is it?
- Yeah.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.475
You're not wrong.

06:42.777 --> 06:46.247
It's like we told the cops.
Staci came over around 6:00,

06:46.615 --> 06:49.084
we went to dinner,
and by the time we got home...

06:49.242 --> 06:51.336
We got home.
We found Staci in the living room

06:51.494 --> 06:54.998
in a pool of blood
and Teagan, in her crib, hysterical.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.962
It was awful.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.509
Can you think of any reason
why somebody would wanna hurt Staci?

07:01.755 --> 07:08.229
No. Staci was super sweet
and popular and pretty...

07:11.389 --> 07:13.391
Anyone who met her, fell in love with her.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.521
Well, maybe it was a crime of passion.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.985
Did Staci have any crazy ex-boyfriends?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.526
No, not that I know of.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.444
Honey?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.994
Why would I have any idea?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.580
Was anything stolen?

07:31.743 --> 07:34.462
Any chance it may have been
a robbery gone wrong?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.875
I don't think so.
I mean, nothing was missing

07:38.083 --> 07:40.381
except for the nanny cam
in the living room.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.498
Thank you for your time.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.899
- Give us a call if something comes up.
- Okay. Thank you.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.727
Hey, is it just me
or is that guy acting a bit hinky?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.409
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.030
Let's split up. You drop me at the morgue
and you can hit Dan at the office.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.917
Yeah, and maybe he'll be a little bit
more open without his wifey around.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.201
Yeah.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.801
Based on the autopsy, the vic was
conscious when her heart was ripped out.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.225
Wouldn't want
a front row seat to that show.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.761
Any ideas what could've done this?

08:30.927 --> 08:33.476
Typically? I'd assume animal attack.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.892
- In a house?
- Exactly. Plus, no claw marks.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.148
I'll be honest with you, Agent.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.655
Been doing this for some 20 odd years
and I'm stumped.

08:47.902 --> 08:48.949
Thanks.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.425
Someone's here to see you, Mr. Harper.
FBI. An Agent Weller?

09:05.837 --> 09:06.963
Send him in, please.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.977
Please have a seat, Agent.
What can I help you with?

09:13.136 --> 09:15.184
I need you to be straight with me, Dan.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.102
Uh, not sure what you mean, Agent.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.402
Oh, I think you do.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.648
I think you're hiding something.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.134
And you didn't want to talk about it
in front of your wife.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.238
You shtupping the babysitter.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.496
Excuse me?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.407
Oh, don't act all fake-offended.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.660
I'm actually tryin'
to help you out here, okay?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.295
Now, personally,
I don't give a rat's ass who you screw.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.045
But I would just hate
for your extracurricular activities

09:43.208 --> 09:45.711
to get you involved
in a federal murder investigation.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.132
Or I could just go talk to your wife.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.855
I wanna be straight with you, Agent.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.774
I really do. But I can't.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.522
- Sure you can.
- No, really.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.409
I mean, it's just too damn weird.
You'd never believe me.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.784
Try me.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.753
Let me guess, the missing nanny cam?

10:21.538 --> 10:23.540
I was having an affair with Staci.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.429
I only took the nanny cam
because she kissed me in front of it.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.885
I forgot the damn thing was there.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.515
Anyway, I was going to erase it
as soon as we got home.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.228
But then, we found Staci's body.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.568
Melissa went upstairs to the baby and I...

10:47.730 --> 10:48.947
Ran for the cam?

10:51.109 --> 10:52.452
I know, it was a dick move.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.660
But I also know the cam
must've recorded the murder.

10:56.114 --> 11:00.085
As soon as I erased the kiss,
I was gonna turn it over to the cops.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.836
I swear.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.751
Until I saw what was on it...

11:47.290 --> 11:50.464
I know that's me,
but I swear it wasn't me.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.639
I would never hurt Staci. I loved her.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.181
I was at dinner the entire time.
If you don't believe me, ask Melissa,

11:59.344 --> 12:00.345
or the waiter.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.980
Or any of the 75 other people
that were there.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.641
You gotta believe me.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.645
Relax. I do.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.027
You do?

12:12.774 --> 12:13.946
I need you to sit tight.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.156
Keep a lid on this
for the time being. Okay?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.957
- Yo.
- Hey.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.252
Find anything?

12:32.919 --> 12:36.469
Uh, yeah. Jack.
Absolutely nothing points to werewolf.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.517
Well.  Step aside, Urkel.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.605
It was Dan that stole the nanny cam.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.310
Why?

12:51.562 --> 12:52.939
He was shtupping the sitter.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.693
Hmm.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.209
Wait a sec.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.544
I thought Dan was at dinner with Melissa.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.206
That's not Dan.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.101
Shapeshifter.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.395
Yahtzee.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.946
Is it okay if I head out?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.239
Yeah.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.361
Are you okay, Mr. Harper?

13:41.029 --> 13:42.531
I'm happy to stay if you need me.

13:42.697 --> 13:45.746
Or maybe you should go home?
Be with your family?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.629
I'll be okay, Gladys.
You have a good night.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.586
Okay.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.574
Excuse me.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.795
Did you forget something?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.217
Staci?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.506
Uh-huh.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.725
What the hell is going on?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.977
I want you to give me your heart.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.979
You're dead. This isn't...

14:49.305 --> 14:52.935
I saw your heart
ripped out of your chest!

14:56.145 --> 14:59.194
Please. What are you doing?

14:59.732 --> 15:00.858
What do you want?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.510
You were the last person
to see your boss alive.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.516
Did you notice anything unusual?

15:27.468 --> 15:31.314
Nothing unusual, per se.
Just kind of rude.

15:32.014 --> 15:36.690
This young girl, brunette, buxom.
Couldn't have been more than 19,

15:37.353 --> 15:40.857
barreled out of the elevator
as I was leaving. Nearly knocked me over.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.947
Is this her?

15:47.071 --> 15:48.948
Yeah, that's the girl.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.665
Thank you for your time, ma'am.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.630
Well, confirms we're dealing
with a shifter.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.420
Yeah, who's upping his game
by impersonating dead people.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.555
- I'm guessing it's the wife.
- Yeah.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.646
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.402
I just can't believe it.
I mean, how is this even possible?

16:18.603 --> 16:21.322
That's what we're trying to figure out.
Where's the baby?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.197
She's with my mom.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.993
I hate to have to ask this, but
I need to ask you a difficult question.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.369
Okay.

16:36.996 --> 16:41.593
Were you aware that your husband
was having an affair with your babysitter?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.180
Yes.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.222
I knew.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.520
I know what you're thinking,

16:53.262 --> 16:56.106
jealous wife kills her cheating husband.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.277
But that couldn't be further
from the truth.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.606
I loved Dan. I still do.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.108
It may sound pathetic,

17:06.275 --> 17:07.992
but I thought we still had a chance.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.188
Well, thank you for your time.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.121
We'll leave you alone,
let you get some rest.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.626
Yeah, before we go,

17:15.785 --> 17:19.130
do you mind just writing down a phone
number where we can get ahold of you?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.915
In case we have any more questions.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.583
Sure.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.814
And, if anything strange
or out of the ordinary comes up,

17:37.390 --> 17:38.642
don't hesitate to call.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.936
We're staying at the motel on Main Street.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.979
Thanks.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.325
All right, so Melissa's not the shifter.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.706
- We're back to square zilch.
- I need a beer.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.491
Regroup. Maybe get lucky.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.705
Didn't you just get lucky?

17:56.867 --> 17:59.040
That was in Kansas.
What do you say, you with me?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.331
Scrape a few hearts off the barroom floor?

18:01.539 --> 18:04.588
Ah, I think I'll pass.
I'm gonna hit the lore, but you go be you.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.294
Suit yourself.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.334
Hey. It's me. I think I messed up.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.595
I don't know what happened
but something went wrong.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.766
And now Dan is dead
and the FBI are asking questions.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.060
Just call me back. ASAP.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.671
Who's there?

19:39.095 --> 19:40.893
Agents? Is that you?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.493
Honey? Let me in.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.455
Baby. It's me.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.248
No, it's not!

20:06.831 --> 20:09.380
Honey, please let me in.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.835
I love you.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.294
Oh!

20:30.146 --> 20:32.194
Don't worry, honey.
I'm not going to hurt you.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.441
I'm your husband.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.317
- Hey, any luck?
- No.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.270
- You?
- Nah.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.365
Hey, what's a "dad bod"?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.289
Hey, there.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.923
- Everything okay?
- No, Dan tried to kill me.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.588
Dan, your dead husband, Dan?

21:37.379 --> 21:41.634
You told me to come to you if anything
strange or out of the ordinary happened.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.725
Well, it did.
And I think it's all my fault.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.856
Okay, why don't you sit down? Come on.

21:49.225 --> 21:53.822
I swear, I really did love Dan.
Maybe a little too much.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.814
I just...

21:56.190 --> 22:00.411
I wanted him to love me back.
So I got some advice.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.248
And I confided in my hairdresser
about the affair...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.667
Wait, women actually do that?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.413
She told me that there was a way
to get him back.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.463
I knew she dabbled in stuff.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.588
Wait a second, what kind of stuff
are you talking about here?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.590
She calls herself

22:21.590 --> 22:22.842
a White Witch.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.766
Listen, I don't know if you believe in
that sort of thing, I normally don't,

22:26.929 --> 22:28.931
but I was desperate.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.059
Let me guess? She gave you a spell?

22:32.434 --> 22:34.857
Yes. A Return to Love spell.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.694
All I had to do was chant it,

22:39.608 --> 22:41.155
and seal it with a kiss.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.958
But I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

22:48.158 --> 22:52.038
I swear, I just wanted my husband back.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.250
Do you happen to have
a copy of the spell on you?

22:57.251 --> 22:58.924
Oh, my... Yes, yes!

23:08.137 --> 23:10.606
Wow. Okay. For starters?

23:11.473 --> 23:12.645
Not a spell.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.811
More like an Aramaic Curse.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.229
- What?
- This?

23:17.605 --> 23:20.074
Roughly translates to the Kiss of Death.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.534
I swear she never told me that.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.240
What does the lore say?

23:24.486 --> 23:26.046
As far as I can tell, there is no lore.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.874
My best guess is this was
the White Witch's home cooking.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.918
Terrific. All right, so what do we know?
Um...

23:32.661 --> 23:34.959
- If you kiss someone, then they die?
- I guess.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.420
Wait a second, you didn't kiss Staci?

23:38.167 --> 23:39.840
No. Of course not.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.887
No, but Dan did.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.891
So the curse is transmittable?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.722
Like a magic STD.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.692
Okay. That works. Kind of makes you
nostalgic for good old fashioned herpes.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.311
Oh, God.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.857
I killed Dan and Staci...

24:01.231 --> 24:04.531
You didn't kill anyone.
This is all on that witch.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.040
Riddle me this. Why did Staci die first,
if she was kissed second?

24:10.199 --> 24:14.420
I don't know. Maybe you're safe
if you can pass the curse on?

24:15.329 --> 24:17.548
Yeah, and then if that person dies,
then it comes back to you?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.626
I mean, that would make sense.
That would explain

24:19.708 --> 24:21.948
why whatever this is,
is working its way back to Melissa.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.504
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.426
Yeah, because it's freaking confusing.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.512
Look, the long and short,
it's like a game of hot potato.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.269
You gotta keep paying it forward.
If you don't, you die.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.814
Melissa. This curse started with you...

24:35.683 --> 24:37.203
Now, I think it wants to end with you.

24:38.394 --> 24:41.739
Don't worry.
Okay, we're not gonna let that happen.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.172
What the hell did you do?

25:07.965 --> 25:09.217
Come on, let's just go.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.090
I'd say that went pretty well.
What do you think?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.338
Wait a second. Are you serious?

25:47.504 --> 25:49.927
You think it's a good idea
to give yourself a fatal curse?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.091
Hold that.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.015
Well, target's off her back, ain't it?

25:56.180 --> 25:59.480
I'm just saying, you don't have
to do this. Be the guinea pig.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.977
- What?
- The martyr.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.479
Trying to carry the weight by yourself.
Do this!

26:03.645 --> 26:04.817
I'm gonna be fine. Okay?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.654
As long as I'm good, she's good,
and that's the important thing.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.739
Besides, it proved our theory, didn't it?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.746
That this whole Kiss of Death curse
is transmittable?

26:12.905 --> 26:16.125
I'm not asking for the Nobel here
but, you know, thank you.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.460
- How long do you think we have?
- I don 't know.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.593
It's not like this thing
is exactly following the pattern.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.471
I don't even know
what I'm looking for here.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.423
But we got out of there pretty quick,
so maybe...

26:29.505 --> 26:31.007
What was that?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.222
Uh, we think it was something called
a shapeshifter

26:34.384 --> 26:38.309
but it can't be because I pumped the thing
full of silver and it didn't even flinch.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.352
What kind of FBI agents are you?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.196
The fake kind.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.482
- We're hunters.
- Hunters?

26:48.649 --> 26:52.370
Look, all you need to know is that we save
people like you from things like that.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.077
Even if it's not a shapeshifter,
it's still shifting shapes.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.287
If we can figure out what it is,
we can find out how to kill it.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.793
All right, what do you know
about the White Witch?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.997
Um, not much. Her name is Sonja,

27:03.163 --> 27:04.756
she's kind of weird.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.460
I don't know. She's only been
my hairdresser for a couple of months.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.752
You know where she lives?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.049
Not a clue.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.452
Where'd she give you the spell?

27:11.505 --> 27:13.178
In the basement of her salon.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.940
"The Art of Dyeing."

27:26.395 --> 27:28.238
Well, can't say she didn't warn you.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.614
All right. Just keep the doors locked
and stay put until we get back.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.278
Unless Sonja shows up.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.576
Then use this on her.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.336
It won't kill her,
but it'll slow her down.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.956
Are you serious? I can't stab anyone!

27:42.703 --> 27:44.080
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.001
Sonja's not just "anyone.â€œ

27:46.331 --> 27:49.301
She is a wicked witch, who offed
your husband and tried to kill you.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.539
So if she shows up here,
you punch her, you stab her,

27:51.545 --> 27:53.425
you drop a freaking house on her
if you have to.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.991
Witch-killing bullets.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.831
We gotta come up
with a better name than that.

28:43.639 --> 28:44.686
Hey.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.798
Locked cabinet.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.010
- Looky there.
- Hey, hey.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.564
All right.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.826
Got it. All right, looks like
we're dealing with a Qareen.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.125
Never heard of it.

29:46.326 --> 29:50.456
It's a "creature, corporeal in form,
a slave to your commands."

29:51.039 --> 29:52.416
Like a genie?

29:52.624 --> 29:56.549
I guess. Here we go, someone chants
the curse and lays a wet one on you,

29:56.712 --> 29:59.090
then the victim is seduced
and killed by the Qareen.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.304
But instead of taking
the form of Barbara Eden,

30:01.466 --> 30:04.595
they present themselves
as your deepest, darkest desire.

30:04.761 --> 30:09.483
Makes sense why sitter was killed by
the husband and the husband by the sitter.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.649
Yeah, and why Melissa was attacked by Dan.
She really loved him.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.064
What?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.031
You know the silver lining
about being cursed?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.369
I'll finally get some face time
with Daisy Duke.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.413
My deepest, darkest desire.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.745
- Seriously?
- Ever since I was seven.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.164
So Bach. Not Simpson.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.128
Eh. Guess I wouldn't say no to either.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.418
All right, how do we kill it?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.546
By stabbing it in its heart.

30:40.547 --> 30:45.303
Uh, well, given that it's got a giant hole
in its chest, does it even have a heart?

30:45.552 --> 30:46.678
Apparently not in him.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.099
The person who possesses the Qareen's
heart is the one who commands it.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.359
So, Sonja, the hairdresser.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.525
All right, let's find us a heart.
I'll take upstairs.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.772
Ah.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.212
- Whatever, I'm going upstairs.
- Okay.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.742
You find anything?

33:24.586 --> 33:26.304
I understand, Dean.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.765
Is that right?

33:28.924 --> 33:32.269
The longing in your heart. I feel it, too.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.529
Well, that's touching.
Considering that you don't have a heart...

33:53.907 --> 33:55.124
Qareen.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.303
I'm guessing you're not really FBI.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.969
You're what? A hunter?

34:14.469 --> 34:18.393
And you're a witch.
Hocking death curses as love spells.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.811
Someone has to punish these men.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.072
You know the only thing worse
than a cheating man

34:25.230 --> 34:27.483
is one who gets away with it.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.447
Wow.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.321
You're practically a feminist.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.996
Who I am doesn't matter.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.380
The real question is who are you?

34:44.331 --> 34:45.833
What do you mean who am I?

34:46.333 --> 34:47.677
You're a mystery.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.425
I can see inside your heart.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.806
Feel the love you feel,

34:57.304 --> 34:59.227
except it's cloaked in shame.

35:03.852 --> 35:08.198
When it comes to this,
you can't help yourself.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.861
So why fight it?

35:16.781 --> 35:18.249
Just give in.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.915
Why hurt Melissa?
She only wanted to save her marriage.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.879
They all do.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.591
Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me,

35:29.878 --> 35:33.052
but they never learn.
I mean, a month, a year,

35:33.214 --> 35:34.966
however long later, they all come back.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.227
Same story, different man.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.520
So you tweaked the curse?

35:40.138 --> 35:43.233
Now it not only punishes the cheaters,

35:43.892 --> 35:47.066
but the foolish women who want them back.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.073
Guess I'm just weeding out the idiots.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.943
And you're next.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.531
Yeah, you know what? You're right.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.494
The real Amara does have a hold on me,

36:01.785 --> 36:05.710
but you are nothing but a cheap imitation.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.367
Sonja! Stop!

36:45.912 --> 36:48.791
Please. Enough is enough!

37:38.339 --> 37:39.431
Dean?

37:40.425 --> 37:43.520
- Yeah!
- It's over. I got it.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.555
- Yeah?
- It's done.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.895
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.526
- You good?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.214
So are you gonna keep me
in suspense here or what?

38:18.379 --> 38:19.722
About what?

38:21.216 --> 38:22.593
Who was it? Bach or Simpson?

38:24.511 --> 38:25.728
Neither.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.279
It was Amara.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.533
That surprise you?

38:43.404 --> 38:45.122
That doesn't surprise you?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.502
- Honestly?
- "Honestly?"

38:49.702 --> 38:53.878
What, you seriously think the sister
of God is my deepest, darkest desire?

38:54.207 --> 38:55.800
- She isn't?
- No!

38:56.626 --> 38:58.754
- She can't be.
- Why not?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.347
Why? Because if she was
then that means I'm...

39:01.381 --> 39:02.473
It means you're what?

39:02.757 --> 39:04.259
Complicit? Weak? Evil?

39:04.509 --> 39:06.307
- For starters, yeah.
- Dean...

39:08.555 --> 39:12.276
Do you honestly think
you ever had a choice in the matter?

39:12.475 --> 39:14.477
She's the sister of God.

39:14.978 --> 39:18.357
And for some reason she picked you,
and that sucks,

39:18.565 --> 39:21.739
but if you think I'm going to blame you
or judge you?

39:22.443 --> 39:23.740
I'm not.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.785
You know that I want her ass dead.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.291
Yes, of course.

39:28.449 --> 39:32.795
And I know you've also probably beaten
yourself up a million times over it,

39:32.996 --> 39:34.248
but where's that gotten us?

39:41.671 --> 39:43.423
Just how bad is it?

39:45.884 --> 39:48.137
Standing here right now?

39:49.429 --> 39:52.182
Every bone in my body
wants to run her through.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.152
Send her back
to that hole she crawled out of.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.489
But when I'm near her...

40:01.900 --> 40:04.369
I don't know, something happens...

40:06.654 --> 40:08.406
I can't explain it.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.503
But to call it desire or love,
I mean, it's not that.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.262
I'm screwed, man.

40:28.009 --> 40:31.559
We want to kill The Darkness,
we need to kill The Darkness.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.816
And I don't think I can.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.738
And I'm sorry to do that to you, you know.
