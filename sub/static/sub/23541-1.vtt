00:54.185 --> 00:55.822
<i>But what if it never arrives?</i>

00:57.323 --> 00:58.825
<i>What if it never finds a home?</i>

01:00.158 --> 01:02.228
<i>Because space is so vast...</i>

01:02.594 --> 01:04.296
<i>and time is so long...</i>

01:05.197 --> 01:06.832

<i>I'm not gonna make it, Spock.</i>

<i>You have to go on

- Good morning, Scottie.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.385
Okay.

03:40.885 --> 03:42.989
Can we try three seconds
of eye contact?

03:43.722 --> 03:45.258
Let's try...
three seconds.

03:49.627 --> 03:52.328
Great.
Three seconds of eye contact.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.399
Yay.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.635
So, next week,
your sister's coming to visit.

03:57.568 --> 03:58.770
How are you feeling about it?

04:00.538 --> 04:01.905
Out loud thinking, please.

04:01.907 --> 04:03.910
I'm feeling somewhat
a little bit nervous.

04:04.376 --> 04:05.510
What does that feel like?

04:05.877 --> 04:07.613
Like I've got to pee,
but I don't.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.780
That's how nervousness
feels for me, too.

04:10.782 --> 04:12.381
But, you know,
there's no need to worry,

04:12.383 --> 04:14.786
we're gonna make sure
you're very well-prepared.

04:16.521 --> 04:19.658
Okay, now, can we go over
your everyday schedule?

04:20.759 --> 04:22.395
My everyday schedule...

04:23.028 --> 04:23.930
<i>Wake up.</i>

04:24.396 --> 04:25.398
<i>Make bed.</i>

04:25.930 --> 04:28.334
<i>Get towel and toiletries.</i>

04:28.934 --> 04:30.570
<i>If my towel smells funny,</i>

04:30.735 --> 04:33.038
<i>put it in the hamper
and get a new towel.</i>

04:33.639 --> 04:34.941
<i>Go into bathroom.</i>

04:35.507 --> 04:37.574
<i>Check to see
if I'm having my period.</i>

04:37.576 --> 04:38.942
<i>If I am having my period,</i>

04:38.944 --> 04:40.711
<i>remember that
I am having my period.</i>

04:40.713 --> 04:41.945
<i>And how do you do that?</i>

04:41.947 --> 04:43.816
I put one thumb up
to help me remember.

04:44.016 --> 04:47.387
If I am having my period,
put on a Kotex maxi pad,

04:47.552 --> 04:49.118
and put my thumb down.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.420
<i>Put on an outfit.</i>

04:50.422 --> 04:51.557
<i>Monday, orange.</i>

04:51.757 --> 04:53.059
<i>Tuesday, lavender.</i>

04:53.524 --> 04:54.926
<i>Wednesday, blue.</i>

04:55.093 --> 04:56.928
<i>Thursday, dots.</i>

04:57.096 --> 04:58.831
<i>Friday, yellow.</i>

04:58.963 --> 05:00.533
<i>Saturday, purple.</i>

05:00.699 --> 05:01.934
<i>Sunday is red.</i>

05:02.401 --> 05:04.336
<i>Go into the kitchen
to make toast.</i>

05:04.670 --> 05:07.471
Unless Richard "the Fuck Face"
is hogging the toaster.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.572
Wendy.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.310
Unless Richard
is hogging the toaster.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.677
<i>Go to work.</i>

05:12.444 --> 05:13.976
<i>Turn right onto Page Street.</i>

05:13.978 --> 05:15.846
<i>Turn right
onto Buchanan Street.</i>

05:15.848 --> 05:17.850
<i>And when I get
to Market Street, stop...</i>

05:21.120 --> 05:23.053
<i>Because I'm not allowed
to cross Market Street</i>

05:23.055 --> 05:24.790
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

05:26.791 --> 05:29.861
<i>Wait for the 321 Bus
to Stonestown Galleria.</i>

05:30.161 --> 05:32.698
<i>Remember to smile at work,
while I say...</i>

05:32.930 --> 05:35.164
Welcome to Cinnabon!
Would you like a Cinnabon?

05:35.166 --> 05:37.733
<i>But don't repeat
the words too quickly.</i>

05:37.735 --> 05:40.469
<i>And make it sound
different each time.</i>

05:40.471 --> 05:42.875
Welcome to Cinnabon.
Would you like a Cinnabon?

05:43.942 --> 05:45.944
Welcome to Cinnabon!
Would you like a Cinnabon?

05:46.745 --> 05:47.879
<i>Three pm, study.</i>

05:48.146 --> 05:50.649
Yeah, see how
his mouth goes down?

05:53.886 --> 05:56.356
- Okay.
- <i>Four pm, take Pete for a walk.</i>

05:56.889 --> 05:58.755
When you see the man
with the legs,

05:58.757 --> 06:00.360
it means you can walk.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.992
When you see the red hand,

06:01.994 --> 06:03.996
it means that you have to
hold up your hand

06:04.163 --> 06:05.564
before you can walk.

06:06.831 --> 06:09.901
<i>Six pm,
watch</i> "Star Trek" <i>on TV Land.</i>

06:13.038 --> 06:14.904
<i>The ship
is still functioning, Captain.</i>

06:14.906 --> 06:15.973
<i>It is logical to assume</i>

06:15.975 --> 06:17.777
<i>the mutineers are
somewhere aboard.</i>

06:18.177 --> 06:19.675
7:00 pm, dinner.

06:19.677 --> 06:20.976
8:00 pm, chores.

06:20.978 --> 06:23.180
And then I have
free time before I go to bed.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.083
Beautiful.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.115
I think your sister's
gonna be very impressed.

06:26.117 --> 06:28.086
- I think she will be, too.
- I would be.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.654
I am.

06:30.855 --> 06:32.923
Okay, now it's time to work
on your "Names and Places".

06:32.925 --> 06:34.694
"Names and Places" sucks!

06:35.160 --> 06:38.060
Well, it's not
my favorite activity either,

06:38.062 --> 06:39.531
but we need to do it.

06:39.697 --> 06:40.766
Can I watch TV?

06:41.132 --> 06:42.798
Yes.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.634
But first,
what do you have to be?

06:44.636 --> 06:45.905
You have to be very...

06:48.240 --> 06:49.509
Calm.

06:50.675 --> 06:51.676
Calm.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.514
Excellent.

07:10.161 --> 07:11.260
Coffee?

07:11.262 --> 07:12.798
Yes, please!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.169
Shit, no milk.

07:25.209 --> 07:26.445
Yeah?

07:31.716 --> 07:33.716
Ah, bless you.

07:33.718 --> 07:34.853
Thanks.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.923
When are you seeing your sister?

07:38.723 --> 07:39.724
Soon.

07:42.093 --> 07:43.596
Mm, that's good.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.307
<i>And now,
an important reminder...</i>

07:57.309 --> 07:58.675
<i>For 50 years,</i>

07:58.677 --> 08:02.715
Star Trek <i>has boldly gone
where no one has gone before.</i>

08:03.014 --> 08:06.015
<i>So, the call is out
and the contest is on.</i>

08:06.017 --> 08:08.618
<i>They want you
to send in your script,</i>

08:08.620 --> 08:11.257
<i>highlighting the best
of the</i> Star Trek <i>universe.</i>

08:11.757 --> 08:13.757
<i>So, fire up
those word processors</i>

08:13.759 --> 08:15.625
<i>because your completed,
printed script</i>

08:15.627 --> 08:17.894
<i>must be received by Paramount</i>

08:17.896 --> 08:19.765
<i>no later than February 16th.</i>

08:20.031 --> 08:23.235
<i>So, get your scripts done,
it's just one week away.</i>

08:27.805 --> 08:30.642
<i>"He stood there,
on the edge of reality...</i>

08:32.177 --> 08:33.909
<i>Only a thin membrane</i>

08:33.912 --> 08:36.048
<i>shielded him
from the chaos beyond...</i>

08:37.649 --> 08:39.885
<i>Could he trust
Commander Worf or not?</i>

08:40.052 --> 08:41.520
<i>He asked himself.</i>

08:43.054 --> 08:44.623
<i>He feared the worst.</i>

08:46.258 --> 08:49.191
<i>Spock looks up at the
star-filled sky,</i>

08:49.193 --> 08:52.899
<i>surveys the barren contours
of this alien wasteland...</i>

08:55.333 --> 08:58.637
<i>'Escape is imperative,'
he whispers."</i>

09:14.086 --> 09:15.153
Hey, Wendy.

09:15.821 --> 09:16.822
Hi, Nemo.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.762
- How's your script coming?
- It's going excellent.

09:23.294 --> 09:24.694
I just wrote a sub-story

09:24.696 --> 09:26.296
where Spock travels
to Deep Space Nine

09:26.298 --> 09:28.167
to recruit Commander Worf
for battle.

09:30.168 --> 09:31.834
That sounds awesome.

09:31.836 --> 09:32.737
Uh...

09:33.371 --> 09:34.970
By the way, I...

09:36.107 --> 09:37.576
I made you something.

09:44.115 --> 09:46.251
It's got some really
dope tracks on there.

09:50.254 --> 09:51.957
I really hope you enjoy it.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.062
I'm gonna clean the mixer.

10:03.134 --> 10:07.105
<i>♪ Oh, say can you see ♪</i>

10:07.272 --> 10:09.672
So, Richard, we've arranged
an interview for you

10:09.674 --> 10:11.407
at the grocery store
at the end of the street.

10:11.409 --> 10:12.944
Does that interest you?

10:13.412 --> 10:15.081
Yeah?

10:15.246 --> 10:16.281
Excuse me.

10:18.082 --> 10:19.017
Hello?

10:19.918 --> 10:21.754
- <i>Is this Scotlyn Kyle?</i>
- Yeah.

10:21.886 --> 10:23.388
<i>Ms. Kyle, this is
Reginald Mayweather</i>

10:23.754 --> 10:24.889
<i>from Balboa High.</i>

10:25.289 --> 10:26.925
Did you get out of bed today?

10:27.125 --> 10:28.027
At all?

10:33.932 --> 10:34.933
Okay.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.636
What's going on with you, Sam?

10:39.770 --> 10:41.805
You ever feel depressed?
Angry?

10:41.807 --> 10:43.473
Mom, stop trying to diagnose me.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.911
Well, why aren't you in school?

10:46.378 --> 10:49.048
We had a deal.
You go to school, you do well.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.050
That's all I ask.

10:51.249 --> 10:53.782
And you have a math test
next week which,

10:53.784 --> 10:55.820
by the way,
I just found out about today.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.692
So, young man,
you are gonna study right here.

11:08.966 --> 11:12.071
Even my grandmother could
answer your stupid questions.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.436
Dude, you might as well
be asking her

11:14.438 --> 11:15.805
what the name of the ship is,

11:15.807 --> 11:17.342
how bout
you find a hard question?

11:17.475 --> 11:19.077
Like in the back of the book.

11:19.977 --> 11:21.076
I got one.

11:21.078 --> 11:22.048
Okay.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.850
In the original series episode,
"Court Martial"...

11:26.951 --> 11:29.355
what award was given
to Mr. Spock?

11:30.288 --> 11:32.224
The Vulcan Scientific
Legion of Honor.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.791
Oh, snap! Pay up!

11:34.793 --> 11:35.858
She's got to be cheating!

11:35.860 --> 11:37.096
She's got a cheat sheet.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.296
How can she cheat, dog?
You're picking the questions!

11:39.298 --> 11:41.498
Maybe she's got the answers
written on her papers!

11:41.500 --> 11:42.701
Look, look.

11:44.369 --> 11:45.705
Double or nothing, then.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.371
Okay.

11:48.373 --> 11:49.372
Go deep, go deep.

11:49.374 --> 11:50.308
Go deep.

11:52.844 --> 11:55.114
What was Dr. Leonard McCoy's
daughter's name?

11:55.312 --> 11:56.314
Joanna.

11:56.981 --> 11:58.314
- What's that?
- What'd you say?

11:58.316 --> 11:59.415
Joanna.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.886
- No way!
- That's impossible!

12:01.186 --> 12:03.887
She got you!
Pay up, bitches!

12:03.889 --> 12:05.254
Suck it!

12:05.256 --> 12:07.192
- Have your dirty money.
- What the Spock.

12:07.392 --> 12:09.358
I don't know, dude,
suck it.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.993
How did she know...?

12:10.995 --> 12:12.996
Should've asked her what
Kirk's grandma's name is.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.134
What is Kirk's grandma's name?

12:21.139 --> 12:23.142
<i>"Peering into
the murky abyss...</i>

12:23.575 --> 12:26.879
<i>Spock saw something
he had never seen before.</i>

12:29.280 --> 12:30.515
<i>A window...</i>

12:32.551 --> 12:34.854
<i>A portal to that other world...</i>

12:47.432 --> 12:49.033
<i>Not a vision,</i>

12:49.301 --> 12:51.237
<i>not a light...</i>

12:52.037 --> 12:53.372
<i>but a feeling...</i>

12:59.376 --> 13:01.513
<i>A feeling
he didn't understand."</i>

13:01.913 --> 13:04.450
...didn't understand.

13:08.452 --> 13:09.954
Wonderment.

13:13.057 --> 13:15.193
Scottie, will you read
my movie script for me, please?

13:15.527 --> 13:16.461
Sure.

13:17.428 --> 13:18.362
Will you read it
as soon as possible, please?

13:19.898 --> 13:21.432
Are movie scripts
supposed to be this long?

13:21.600 --> 13:22.468
Yes.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.600
Because it's an epic saga,

13:24.602 --> 13:26.104
it should be long,
highly detailed,

13:26.270 --> 13:27.305
thorough.

13:29.073 --> 13:31.109
In my script, Spock travels
back and forth through time

13:31.275 --> 13:32.210
to save the Federation.

13:32.443 --> 13:34.045
Wow, sounds fascinating.

13:34.211 --> 13:35.578
Towards the end,
there are a few passages

13:35.580 --> 13:36.912
in the Klingon language,

13:36.914 --> 13:38.817
but don't worry,
there will be subtitles.

13:39.216 --> 13:40.318
Good to know.

13:57.969 --> 14:00.603
You know,
we can still take it with us.

14:00.605 --> 14:02.508
- No room.
- Well...

14:03.475 --> 14:05.211
We could have it shipped.

14:05.677 --> 14:07.111
We can't afford it.

14:11.482 --> 14:12.884
I thought you loved playing.

14:14.085 --> 14:15.521
I liked it when Wendy played.

14:18.389 --> 14:20.458
I'm gonna go see
if Ruby's awake yet.

14:32.102 --> 14:33.137
Hey.

14:34.673 --> 14:35.607
What?

14:36.541 --> 14:38.177
What's a "tribble"?

14:38.509 --> 14:40.980
It's kind of like a guinea
pig-type thing,

14:41.145 --> 14:43.348
but without legs, or a face,

14:43.514 --> 14:45.250
and it reproduces like crazy.

15:16.014 --> 15:17.216
<i>Wendy.</i>

15:19.183 --> 15:20.685
<i>Pay attention. Look.</i>

15:21.052 --> 15:24.657
<i>Fork goes on the left,
right on top. Fork on the left.</i>

15:25.456 --> 15:27.058
<i>You try, your turn.</i>

15:27.325 --> 15:29.194
<i>On the left.
Put it on the left.</i>

15:30.729 --> 15:32.163
<i>Yeah, good job.</i>

15:32.764 --> 15:33.698
<i>And the knife.</i>

15:34.899 --> 15:35.934
<i>You see the knife?
Wendy, look at the knife.</i>

15:37.168 --> 15:38.233
<i>It goes on the right.</i>

15:38.235 --> 15:39.437
<i>Just like that.</i>

15:44.208 --> 15:45.343
<i>Wanna try the plate?</i>

15:46.544 --> 15:47.676
<i>That one's easy,
it goes right in the middle.</i>

15:47.678 --> 15:49.180
<i>You can do it. Come on.</i>

15:54.619 --> 15:55.721
<i>Mom!</i>

15:59.624 --> 16:00.625
<i>Stop!</i>

16:01.759 --> 16:02.791
<i>Mom!</i>

16:02.793 --> 16:04.263
What are you watching?

16:12.770 --> 16:15.440
<i>♪ Hey, lio-lio-lio ♪</i>

16:16.274 --> 16:19.345
<i>♪ Hey, lio-lilee-lio ♪</i>

16:19.510 --> 16:20.611
<i>You wanna try?</i>

16:36.594 --> 16:38.664
<i>Yeah!
You did it!</i>

16:40.597 --> 16:44.402
<i>♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪</i>

16:53.477 --> 16:57.015
<i>♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪</i>

17:01.686 --> 17:03.155
<i>Good job!</i>

17:09.693 --> 17:12.694
"Spock looks
up at the star-filled sky,

17:12.695 --> 17:16.567
surveys the barren contours
of this alien wasteland.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.172
'Spock, escape is imperative,'
he whispers..."

17:20.337 --> 17:21.536
Hey, Wendy.

17:21.538 --> 17:22.637
Big day tomorrow.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.175
Anything you need before I go?

17:24.342 --> 17:25.711
Have you read my script yet?

17:26.344 --> 17:27.445
I'm working on it.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.418
- Night.
- Good night.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.240
<i>Thank you
for working with Wendy.</i>

18:28.506 --> 18:30.375
<i>I know how difficult
she can be.</i>

18:32.509 --> 18:34.113
To tell you the truth,
I'm scared.

18:34.645 --> 18:35.513
Wendy's changed.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.383
She's made huge strides
since being here.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.352
She's come such a long way.

18:40.852 --> 18:43.255
You'll see when you talk to her.

18:52.396 --> 18:53.531
I'll leave you to it.

18:54.665 --> 18:55.733
Hi, Wendy.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.269
Hi, Audrey.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.539
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

19:02.673 --> 19:03.775
I like your outfit.

19:05.542 --> 19:06.777
It's so purple.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.650
So, I heard you got a job.

19:12.549 --> 19:13.417
Do you like it?

19:14.451 --> 19:16.188
No, it sucks, but at least
I get to make Cinnabons.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.889
Oh.

19:19.923 --> 19:23.295
I brought you a picture of Ruby.

19:30.434 --> 19:31.702
What can Ruby do now?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.273
She can say "Mama" and "Dada"...

19:34.705 --> 19:35.807
and "Elmo".

19:36.007 --> 19:38.277
She loves Elmo.

19:40.612 --> 19:41.978
Can I have this picture of Ruby?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.582
Yeah, I brought it for you.

19:48.586 --> 19:49.788
When can I meet Ruby?

19:50.387 --> 19:51.322
Soon.

19:52.589 --> 19:53.692
I'm her aunt.

19:56.994 --> 19:59.295
So, Wendy,
I came to visit today

19:59.297 --> 20:01.029
because there's something
I need to tell you.

20:01.031 --> 20:03.501
Um, Jack has finally found
a new job and...

20:03.701 --> 20:06.471
There's a <i>Star Trek</i>
script-writing contest.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.673
Oh, okay, cool.

20:08.839 --> 20:10.038
It's a contest
where they're having

20:10.040 --> 20:11.373
people write their own
<i>Star Trek</i> movie scripts

20:11.375 --> 20:12.475
and I wrote a script.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.609
Oh, wow!

20:13.611 --> 20:14.876
Today is the last day
to send it in,

20:14.878 --> 20:17.046
but I didn't want to send it in
until it was absolutely ready.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.814
So, I double-checked
and triple-checked,

20:18.816 --> 20:20.048
and quadruple-checked,

20:20.050 --> 20:21.950
and it's ready to go
to the post office now.

20:21.952 --> 20:23.753
So, if we mail it,
it'll get there right on time.

20:23.755 --> 20:24.623
It's ready to go.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.323
So, we can go to the post office
and then I can go home with you.

20:27.325 --> 20:28.527
Wendy, we talked about this.

20:28.726 --> 20:30.759
After I win, I'll have $100,000,

20:30.761 --> 20:32.628
and you won't have to take care
of me anymore,

20:32.630 --> 20:33.863
and you won't have
to sell Mom's house.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.331
But I don't want to take you
out of here

20:35.333 --> 20:36.301
when you're doing so good.

20:37.535 --> 20:38.633
It's not that I don't want to,
it's that it's not a good time.

20:38.635 --> 20:39.768
Don't you like it here?

20:39.770 --> 20:41.036
No, I have to eat pizza
on Thursdays

20:41.038 --> 20:42.037
even if I don't want to.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.773
I can't watch TV when I want to.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.377
I can't write when I want to.

20:45.777 --> 20:48.013
So, I'm ready to go home
with you now, Audrey.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.414
Wendy, please don't do this now.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.649
I have a job now.
I can get there all by myself.

20:53.651 --> 20:55.651
Ask me anything,
I'll tell you the right answer.

20:55.653 --> 20:56.721
Please, stop.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.789
I can take care of myself now.

20:59.356 --> 21:00.722
So, I'm ready
to go home with you,

21:00.724 --> 21:02.490
and I can help you
take care of Ruby.

21:02.492 --> 21:03.894
Wendy, you can't.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.265
You can't take care of a baby.

21:06.998 --> 21:08.400
How do you know?

21:09.099 --> 21:10.668
How do you know I can't?

21:10.801 --> 21:11.936
Wendy...

21:12.537 --> 21:14.573
I'm ready
to go home now, Audrey.

21:14.771 --> 21:16.274
I wanna go home.

21:16.874 --> 21:18.576
I'm ready to go home now.

21:20.411 --> 21:21.380
Scottie!

21:22.580 --> 21:23.546
Can you please tell Audrey
that I'm ready to go home now?

21:23.548 --> 21:24.580
Wendy, it's okay.

21:24.582 --> 21:25.780
Have you been encouraging this?

21:25.782 --> 21:26.981
Shut up.

21:26.983 --> 21:28.551
We have to discuss
everybody's future,

21:28.553 --> 21:29.785
where they want to be,
where they see themselves.

21:29.787 --> 21:31.120
- This is where she lives now.
- Shut up!

21:31.122 --> 21:32.955
Because Wendy,
I don't think

21:32.957 --> 21:34.556
- I can take care of you.
- Shut up!

21:34.558 --> 21:35.693
Shut up!

21:35.826 --> 21:37.429
Wendy, please stop.

21:37.561 --> 21:38.960
- Shut up!
- Wendy, stop.

21:38.962 --> 21:39.830
Shut up!

21:40.530 --> 21:41.899
Please stand by.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.302
Please, stand by.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.836
Please, stand by.

21:45.435 --> 21:46.837
Please, stand by.
Please, stand by.

21:47.038 --> 21:47.972
Breathe.

21:48.105 --> 21:49.540
Please, stand by.

21:50.674 --> 21:52.476
Please, stand by.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.713
Breathe.

21:55.445 --> 21:57.315
That's it.
Please stand by.

21:57.815 --> 21:59.418
You're gonna be okay.

22:02.953 --> 22:04.455
Please, stand by.

22:05.789 --> 22:07.858
That's it.
Please, stand by.

22:09.693 --> 22:11.363
You're gonna be okay.

22:12.563 --> 22:13.732
You're gonna be okay.

22:14.065 --> 22:15.600
Please, stand by.

22:17.134 --> 22:18.869
You're gonna be okay.

23:05.148 --> 23:06.384
Wendy.

23:07.518 --> 23:08.886
It's 7:00 pm.

23:16.727 --> 23:18.794
Come on, we have to move on
to the next item

23:18.796 --> 23:19.929
in your schedule.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.165
It's dinner time.

23:22.066 --> 23:24.568
You wanna come downstairs?
We're having chili mac.

23:29.539 --> 23:30.674
You know what?

23:31.075 --> 23:32.607
If you want,

23:32.609 --> 23:35.913
you can skip chores tonight
and write instead.

23:41.018 --> 23:42.187
Okay, well...

23:44.555 --> 23:46.158
We can talk some more
in the morning.

23:46.790 --> 23:47.826
Okay, Wendy?

24:17.587 --> 24:21.725
"Your completed, properly-
formatted, printed script

24:22.093 --> 24:25.130
must be received
by Paramount Pictures by

24:25.596 --> 24:27.865
5:00 pm on February 16th."

24:30.300 --> 24:32.770
February 16th is this Tuesday.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.740
Today is Sunday.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.809
There's no mail pickup
on Sundays.

24:39.277 --> 24:41.145
And Monday is a holiday.

24:42.613 --> 24:44.482
It's too late.

24:44.882 --> 24:46.485
It's too late.

24:47.218 --> 24:49.019
It's too late.

24:50.253 --> 24:52.022
It's too late.

24:53.156 --> 24:54.859
It's too late.

25:01.231 --> 25:02.500
Okay.

25:08.638 --> 25:10.274
Buses go to Los Angeles.

25:10.740 --> 25:12.510
I could take
a bus to Los Angeles.

25:12.777 --> 25:15.913
How much will a bus
to Los Angeles cost?

25:17.781 --> 25:20.117
Probably the same
as the 321 bus,

25:20.284 --> 25:23.255
because it is also a bus.

25:26.923 --> 25:29.193
How long will it take
to get there?

25:29.326 --> 25:30.761
I don't know.

25:30.928 --> 25:32.531
What if I forget where I am?

25:32.997 --> 25:34.164
What if I have to pee?

25:34.798 --> 25:36.067
Please, stand by.

25:36.933 --> 25:38.135
Please, stand by.

25:38.836 --> 25:40.171
Please, stand by.

25:40.671 --> 25:42.774
Please, please, stand by.

25:53.317 --> 25:54.920
I can't go out at night.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.721
I have to wait till sunrise.

25:56.921 --> 25:58.155
When is sunrise?

26:30.688 --> 26:32.691
"Come in, Enterprise...

26:33.824 --> 26:36.094
Enterprise, this is Spock."

28:30.508 --> 28:31.910
Go home, Pete.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.246
You can't come with me
to Paramount Pictures.

28:41.551 --> 28:43.253
Go home, Pete!

28:53.864 --> 28:54.865
Okay.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.036
But you have to eat peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches,

28:58.234 --> 28:59.403
just like people do.

29:31.167 --> 29:32.269
Hello?

29:36.539 --> 29:38.175
Does this bus go to Los Angeles?

29:46.016 --> 29:47.786
Does this bus go to Los Angeles?

30:11.208 --> 30:12.944
Does this bus go to Los Angeles?

30:13.076 --> 30:15.313
No, you need to go
to the Transbay Terminal

30:15.479 --> 30:16.879
on Fremont Street.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.346
That's on the other side
of Market Street.

30:18.348 --> 30:19.614
Okay, thank you.

30:19.616 --> 30:20.915
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:20.917 --> 30:22.820
The other way,
the other way!

30:23.053 --> 30:24.355
Okay, thank you.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.057
Wendy?

30:31.327 --> 30:32.497
Madeline!

30:36.066 --> 30:37.101
Wendy's not in her room.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.368
We've got to find her.

30:38.501 --> 30:39.570
Okay.

30:39.970 --> 30:42.339
- Wendy? Wendy?
- Wendy?

30:43.574 --> 30:44.609
Wendy!

30:59.990 --> 31:01.657
We're not allowed
to cross Market Street

31:01.659 --> 31:03.161
under any circumstances.

32:02.185 --> 32:03.420
You need a ticket.

32:04.688 --> 32:05.988
What?

32:05.990 --> 32:07.925
You need a ticket
to ride the bus.

32:08.592 --> 32:09.661
Oh.

32:11.729 --> 32:12.931
You...

32:14.064 --> 32:15.099
need...

32:16.000 --> 32:17.567
Hey, little missy...

32:18.234 --> 32:19.937
Go buy a ticket!

32:20.336 --> 32:21.471
Where you going?

32:21.739 --> 32:23.207
Los Angeles.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.475
Excuse me?

32:25.075 --> 32:26.711
- Los Angeles.
- One way or round-trip?

32:27.778 --> 32:29.244
What?

32:29.246 --> 32:31.049
Are you staying there
or are you coming back?

32:31.615 --> 32:32.680
Coming back.

32:32.682 --> 32:34.551
Okay, round trip, that'll be...

32:35.118 --> 32:36.119
86 dollars.

33:01.711 --> 33:03.213
I've got a ticket.

33:04.114 --> 33:06.116
It's a round-trip ticket
because I'm coming back.

33:06.517 --> 33:07.618
Great.

33:07.785 --> 33:09.120
Can I have it?

33:18.528 --> 33:20.094
We have to be quiet, Pete,

33:20.096 --> 33:22.366
so that we don't disturb
the other passengers.

34:22.726 --> 34:26.063
Mommy, there's a doggie
in that lady's bag.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.748
I know, Pete.
But you've got to hold it.

34:49.686 --> 34:51.222
Okay, I'll ask.

35:08.938 --> 35:10.574
Excuse me, bus driver.

35:12.576 --> 35:13.844
My friend needs to pee.

35:14.244 --> 35:15.246
Restroom's broken.

35:16.447 --> 35:16.878
Tell your friend
the next stop's in an hour.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.382
Okay, thank you.

35:20.617 --> 35:21.619
Don't do it, Pete!

35:41.438 --> 35:43.907
This is what happens
when you pee on the bus.

35:55.284 --> 35:57.154
Oh, wait.

35:57.788 --> 35:58.789
One second.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.487
Hello?

36:00.489 --> 36:01.925
<i>Hey, Audrey.
It's Scottie here.</i>

36:02.559 --> 36:04.394
Listen, I...

36:05.429 --> 36:07.431
I got in this morning
and Wendy wasn't here.

36:08.632 --> 36:09.700
Then, where is she?

36:09.932 --> 36:11.199
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:11.201 --> 36:14.172
<i>I suggest you stay put
in case she's headed your way.</i>

36:14.570 --> 36:16.339
So, you have no idea
where she is?

36:21.577 --> 36:22.579
Uh...

36:23.547 --> 36:24.849
I'm gonna call you back.

36:37.960 --> 36:43.700
"Bus restrooms do not work."

38:19.596 --> 38:21.431
It's okay.

38:44.788 --> 38:46.590
Her name's Madison.

38:48.724 --> 38:49.826
Hi, Madison.

38:51.427 --> 38:52.730
We call her Maddy sometimes,

38:53.496 --> 38:55.732
especially when she gets
upset and starts crying.

38:56.532 --> 38:58.001
Maddy's very, very cute.

38:58.702 --> 38:59.536
Thank you.

39:00.103 --> 39:02.807
I'm an aunt.
I have a niece named Ruby.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.576
- Does Maddy have an aunt?
- She has three.

39:07.476 --> 39:08.978
Do you like being an aunt?

39:09.713 --> 39:10.748
I don't know.

39:10.981 --> 39:11.882
You don't know?

39:12.983 --> 39:14.452
I've never met Ruby.

39:16.952 --> 39:19.487
My sister's afraid
I might hurt her.

39:19.489 --> 39:20.757
I used to have tantrums.

39:21.090 --> 39:22.393
When was that?

39:24.094 --> 39:25.496
When I was younger.

39:26.028 --> 39:27.498
That's so sad.

39:27.731 --> 39:29.834
But I can't imagine
you hurting a baby, not ever.

39:31.467 --> 39:33.837
You can hang out with
me and Maddy if you want.

39:34.204 --> 39:35.373
Come on.

39:36.505 --> 39:37.604
Now, come on.

39:37.606 --> 39:38.742
Come sit.

39:49.186 --> 39:50.788
So, where are you headed?

39:51.922 --> 39:53.157
Los Angeles.

39:54.523 --> 39:57.027
I'm going to enter a contest,
a writing contest.

39:58.494 --> 39:59.797
I hope you win.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.400
I'm gonna say
a little prayer for you.

40:04.768 --> 40:06.436
What kind of prayer?

40:07.536 --> 40:08.405
Oh, I don't know.

40:08.637 --> 40:09.539
A good one.

40:10.039 --> 40:11.007
Don't you worry.

40:11.675 --> 40:12.777
What's the matter?

40:13.043 --> 40:14.010
Here...

40:14.177 --> 40:16.146
- Do you wanna hold her?
- No, no.

40:19.181 --> 40:20.417
It's okay.

40:31.094 --> 40:32.929
Look at the puppy.

40:33.963 --> 40:35.166
Oh!

40:36.199 --> 40:38.101
Wanna pet the puppy?

40:42.806 --> 40:44.171
You know what,
me and my boyfriend,

40:44.173 --> 40:45.576
we're actually going
down to L.A.

40:45.842 --> 40:47.108
So, if you don't have a ride,

40:47.110 --> 40:48.813
maybe you should just
come with us.

40:51.047 --> 40:52.081
Yeah?

40:52.548 --> 40:53.983
Would you like that?

40:54.851 --> 40:56.987
I'd like that very, very much.

40:57.987 --> 40:58.922
Okay, then.

40:59.722 --> 41:00.858
Let's go, Jules.

41:02.992 --> 41:04.128
You ready?

41:05.594 --> 41:07.964
I've got to fill up
my water bottle first.

41:08.998 --> 41:10.067
Okay.

41:35.157 --> 41:37.027
- Give it to me!
- No!

41:40.730 --> 41:42.166
Give me my notebook back!

41:42.599 --> 41:44.101
Give me my notebook back!

41:46.101 --> 41:47.637
I'm sorry.

41:59.983 --> 42:01.885
They stole my iPod, Pete.

42:57.373 --> 42:59.976

43:53.362 --> 43:55.632

44:59.963 --> 45:01.295
Hi.

45:01.297 --> 45:03.430
<i>So, she was on a bus
heading to Los Angeles.</i>

45:03.432 --> 45:06.369
The driver removed her
just off the I-5.

45:06.536 --> 45:08.238
- <i>They're trying to locate her.</i>
- What?

45:08.438 --> 45:10.807
We are doing everything
we can to find her.

45:10.974 --> 45:13.240
And if she calls you,
let me know right away, okay?

45:13.242 --> 45:14.244
Yeah.

45:53.483 --> 45:55.152
Where's my money?

46:04.994 --> 46:06.864
How much do all
of these candy bars cost?

46:07.429 --> 46:08.998
Uh...

46:10.065 --> 46:11.534
A buck a piece.

46:13.168 --> 46:16.906
It says there are 18 inside,
so that's $18.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.076
Yeah, 18 dollars.

46:19.242 --> 46:20.277
What?

46:21.543 --> 46:22.779
Don't cheat her.

46:23.445 --> 46:26.784
That candy is $2.99
and you know it.

46:27.182 --> 46:29.786
Don't be looking at me
with your squinched-up face.

46:30.519 --> 46:33.157
You were gonna take her money,
and that's called stealing.

46:34.157 --> 46:35.559
Now you apologize.

46:38.061 --> 46:39.062
I'm sorry.

46:39.262 --> 46:40.297
That's better.

46:41.164 --> 46:42.232
Honey...

46:43.199 --> 46:45.335
Don't let people
take advantage of you, okay?

46:51.940 --> 46:54.076
I've got a grandson like you.

46:54.309 --> 46:55.945
Sweetest boy in the world,

46:56.112 --> 46:59.081
but he always has trouble
trying to figure it all out.

47:04.186 --> 47:05.922
This is my niece, Ruby.

47:06.088 --> 47:08.090
Oh, she's adorable!

47:09.425 --> 47:10.961
So, where's your family?

47:11.360 --> 47:13.931
992 Heath Road,
Oakland, California.

47:14.463 --> 47:16.599
You mean you're out here
all by yourself?

47:18.333 --> 47:20.102
No, I have Pete with me.

47:20.302 --> 47:22.239
Yeah, but who's
taking care of you?

47:24.974 --> 47:25.976
I am.

47:26.242 --> 47:28.144
Oh, honey, that's not right.

47:28.344 --> 47:30.847
You shouldn't be out here
all by yourself.

47:31.380 --> 47:33.149
Why don't you come with me?

47:43.992 --> 47:46.126
- Where are you going?
- She's out there.

47:46.128 --> 47:46.929
Alone.

47:47.262 --> 47:48.398
Somewhere between here
and Los Angeles.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.635
Okay, so what, you're just gonna
drive down the interstate

47:52.001 --> 47:52.903
looking for her?

47:53.101 --> 47:54.337
Yeah, I am.

47:55.003 --> 47:56.537
I can't just sit here.

47:56.539 --> 47:58.005
I'm going.

47:58.007 --> 47:59.476
There's plenty of breast milk
in the fridge.

48:11.721 --> 48:14.557
Are you going to Paramount
Pictures to be an actress?

48:15.724 --> 48:17.193
You're pretty enough.

48:17.994 --> 48:19.663
No, I'm a writer.

48:21.264 --> 48:22.633
I wrote a script.

48:23.498 --> 48:26.168
It's 427 pages long.

48:26.302 --> 48:27.570
Oh, my goodness!

48:28.438 --> 48:29.606
What's it about?

48:30.206 --> 48:33.043
It's about two old friends
who are separated.

48:34.043 --> 48:36.313
And one of them, Spock,
is a Vulcan.

48:37.146 --> 48:39.449
He discovers
how to have a sense of humor.

48:40.750 --> 48:43.316
He makes a special study
of the anatomy of jokes

48:43.318 --> 48:46.188
which were a part of old,
or primitive, Vulcan culture.

48:46.722 --> 48:48.722
He relates different parts
of a joke

48:48.724 --> 48:50.324
to different facial expressions

48:50.326 --> 48:52.663
according to
old holographic archives...

48:53.463 --> 48:55.332
and he figures out
a scientific equation

48:55.530 --> 48:56.697
for a sense of humor.

48:56.699 --> 48:59.336
Oh, I wish my grandson
could meet you.

49:01.036 --> 49:04.473
He would so get whatever it is
you're talking about.

49:06.442 --> 49:08.679
He would think
you were pretty cool.

49:10.612 --> 49:12.648
I'd love to see him more myself.

49:13.449 --> 49:15.719
But I'm here and he's there.

49:20.456 --> 49:22.092
Why don't you live with him?

49:22.257 --> 49:24.460
I don't wanna be
anybody's burden.

49:25.193 --> 49:26.963
People have their own lives,

49:27.429 --> 49:30.567
and after a while,
those lives don't include you.

49:35.103 --> 49:36.704
Yes, her name is Wendy Welcott.

49:36.706 --> 49:40.376
She's 21 years old.
Five-foot-four, blonde.

49:44.112 --> 49:45.248
Thanks anyway.

50:27.523 --> 50:28.557
<i>Miss?</i>

50:28.791 --> 50:30.693
<i>Miss?
Can you hear me?</i>

50:31.626 --> 50:32.661
<i>Miss?</i>

50:35.264 --> 50:36.432
What's she saying?

50:36.766 --> 50:38.034
Welcome to Cinnabon.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.770
Would you like
to try a Cinnabon?

50:42.438 --> 50:44.671
No fractures,
no bleedings.

50:44.673 --> 50:46.206
Suspected mild concussion.

50:46.208 --> 50:47.675
They wanna keep her
for a day or two,

50:47.677 --> 50:49.179
but we're just waiting on a bed.

50:49.344 --> 50:51.177
Would you mind
grabbing her chart?

50:51.179 --> 50:52.815
I have to go.

50:54.851 --> 50:56.586
I want to go.

51:01.824 --> 51:03.427
I have to go.

51:04.827 --> 51:06.730
Wendy Welcott.

51:06.862 --> 51:08.697
<i>We've got four Jane Does
in here.</i>

51:09.197 --> 51:12.469
Well, she's five-foot-four,
blonde.

51:12.601 --> 51:14.200
<i>They've all got
blonde hair.</i>

51:14.202 --> 51:15.536
They're all five-foot-something.

51:15.538 --> 51:17.338
<i>Hell, we even have
a Jane Dog in here.</i>

51:19.208 --> 51:20.374
Wait, what did you just say?

51:20.376 --> 51:22.079
We've got a Jane Dog here.

51:23.612 --> 51:24.681
John Dog.

51:26.048 --> 51:28.317
<i>Is he wearing
a</i> Star Trek <i>uniform?</i>

51:28.483 --> 51:29.485
A what?

51:30.786 --> 51:33.355
<i>A</i> Star Trek uniform.
<i>Is he wearing one?</i>

51:34.489 --> 51:36.392
Oh, yeah, he is!

51:36.626 --> 51:38.628
Ah, look at that!

51:38.760 --> 51:40.226
<i>That's so cute.</i>

51:40.228 --> 51:42.198
Okay, where are you again,
exactly?

51:44.634 --> 51:46.233
Hey, wake up.

51:46.235 --> 51:48.238
I need you to get dressed.
You're coming with me.

51:51.773 --> 51:53.242
Mom, what's going on?

51:54.510 --> 51:56.580
Oh, a patient of mine ran away.
So, please just go get dressed.

52:03.719 --> 52:04.788
Where are we even going?

52:04.920 --> 52:06.155
Bakersfield.

52:06.521 --> 52:07.490
What?

52:08.557 --> 52:10.659
She's trying to get to L.A.
and turn in a script

52:10.860 --> 52:12.295
for this competition.

52:14.597 --> 52:16.299
Is it any good?

52:16.498 --> 52:18.231
- What?
- The script.

52:18.233 --> 52:20.233
Oh, I could only get
a few pages in.

52:20.235 --> 52:21.304
I don't get it.

52:22.237 --> 52:23.239
What don't you get?

52:24.273 --> 52:26.809
Okay, so, I know
he's the hero of <i>Star Wars,</i>

52:27.242 --> 52:29.746
but who exactly is
this Kirk person?

52:32.414 --> 52:35.684
Please, crash this car right now
because we both deserve to die!

52:35.818 --> 52:36.887
Sam!

52:37.820 --> 52:40.157
In <i>Star Trek...</i>

52:40.822 --> 52:42.759
- Okay.
- James T. Kirk is the captain

52:42.925 --> 52:44.327
of the starship Enterprise.

52:44.527 --> 52:47.427
Right, that's the spaceship
they're on, right?

52:47.429 --> 52:49.932
Yes, yes, the spaceship.
Great job, Mom.

52:54.302 --> 52:56.470
But why does she find it
so fascinating?

52:56.472 --> 52:57.574
That's what I don't get.

52:57.706 --> 52:59.442
I don't know.
Maybe it's the characters.

52:59.708 --> 53:00.777
What do you mean?

53:02.644 --> 53:04.979
Like Spock, for example.

53:04.981 --> 53:06.716
He's half-human, half-alien.

53:06.849 --> 53:09.186
He has trouble
dealing with his emotions.

53:11.353 --> 53:12.454
Where did it say that?

53:12.655 --> 53:13.957
That's just how he is.

53:46.021 --> 53:47.824
Have a good one, okay?

53:51.460 --> 53:53.929
You are going to Ward C.

53:54.764 --> 53:56.496
I don't want to go to Ward C.

53:56.498 --> 53:57.898
I want to go
to Paramount Pictures.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.300
Well, I'm sorry, little lady,

53:59.302 --> 54:00.900
it looks like you
are going to Ward C.

54:00.902 --> 54:01.770
Where am I?

54:02.338 --> 54:03.907
You're at the hospital.
You hit your head.

54:05.373 --> 54:06.642
Where's Pete?

54:07.342 --> 54:08.675
- Where's my dog?
- He's okay.

54:08.677 --> 54:10.547
The nurses have him.
They gave him a little bath.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.282
Let's get you outta here, huh?

54:14.916 --> 54:16.252
Away we go.

54:22.891 --> 54:23.792
I've got to pee.

54:24.827 --> 54:26.092
You can pee when
we get you upstairs, all right?

54:26.094 --> 54:27.661
No, I've got to pee right now.

54:27.663 --> 54:28.929
Right now, I've got to pee.

54:28.931 --> 54:31.367
- Right now.
- All right, okay, okay.

54:31.634 --> 54:32.802
Let's make it quick.

54:42.010 --> 54:44.581
<i>I heard you scared
the crap out of a cop.</i>

54:46.014 --> 54:47.583
<i>My dad was a cop.</i>

54:47.949 --> 54:50.819
Yeah, he had this walrus
moustache and everything.

54:51.653 --> 54:53.690
When we were kids
and we misbehaved,

54:54.123 --> 54:55.891
he used to give us demerits.

54:56.092 --> 54:58.295
"You loaded my gun wrong.
That's a demerit."

54:58.527 --> 55:00.059
"It's the wrong Elvis record.
Demerit."

55:00.061 --> 55:02.031
"Clothes on the floor.
Demerit."

55:02.398 --> 55:05.302
And if you were lucky enough
to get enough demerits,

55:05.534 --> 55:06.970
you had to sleep in the shed.

55:07.135 --> 55:09.572
Even now when I come home,
he's like,

55:09.704 --> 55:11.537
"You'd better move out
of the house soon,

55:11.539 --> 55:13.474
or I'm gonna make you
sleep in the shed."

55:13.476 --> 55:14.641
Cut it out!

55:14.643 --> 55:16.409
That's not a funny thing
to joke about.

55:16.411 --> 55:17.945
You know, I'm your son.

55:17.947 --> 55:20.481
Show me a little respect.
Don't joke like that.

55:20.483 --> 55:21.851
Just quit kidding around.

55:26.489 --> 55:27.856
You all good in there?

55:30.726 --> 55:32.061
That's a long pee.

55:32.961 --> 55:34.998
Okay, I'm gonna come inside,
all right?

55:35.864 --> 55:37.000
I'm coming in!

55:44.472 --> 55:45.808
She jumped out the window!

55:45.974 --> 55:47.643
She jumped out the window!

56:21.143 --> 56:22.778
I'll come back for you, Pete.

56:33.521 --> 56:34.523
Wendy!

56:37.760 --> 56:38.795
Hey!

56:46.635 --> 56:48.538
Yeah, I'm on my way right now.

56:53.242 --> 56:54.577
Oh, my God!

57:05.788 --> 57:06.990
Oh, my script!

57:07.523 --> 57:08.725
My script...

57:09.592 --> 57:10.727
My...

57:17.233 --> 57:18.701
Hey! Stop!

57:53.568 --> 57:54.601
Mom...

57:54.603 --> 57:56.072
This is Wendy's script.

57:58.273 --> 57:59.509
Wendy?

58:01.744 --> 58:02.778
Wendy!

58:07.215 --> 58:09.016
You need to calm down.

58:09.018 --> 58:11.150
Getting angry is not
gonna help the situation.

58:11.152 --> 58:12.318
Hey, I am not angry.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.789
Nobody's angry here.

58:13.956 --> 58:15.121
I'm just trying to figure out

58:15.123 --> 58:16.322
what the hell is wrong
with you people!

58:16.324 --> 58:18.260
Whoa, easy now.
Come on, Scottie.

58:18.626 --> 58:20.293
Nothing is wrong with us, ma'am,
but given the way

58:20.295 --> 58:22.628
you're speaking to me, I guess
something must wrong with you.

58:22.630 --> 58:23.732
Hey!

58:23.898 --> 58:25.268
Something's gonna be wrong
with your face

58:25.768 --> 58:27.800
if you don't stop talking
to my mom like that!

58:27.802 --> 58:29.235
I'm gonna need the both of you
to calm down.

58:29.237 --> 58:31.003
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

58:31.005 --> 58:33.175
but this is just
completely unacceptable.

58:33.608 --> 58:34.677
Where's my sister?

58:35.677 --> 58:37.614
- Are you Ms. Welcott?
- Yeah. Where's Wendy?

58:38.047 --> 58:39.249
I am sorry, but...

58:39.614 --> 58:40.880
she slipped by the duty nurse.

58:40.882 --> 58:42.048
We have no idea how,

58:42.050 --> 58:43.316
but we've looked
everywhere for her.

58:43.318 --> 58:44.650
We've got officers
up and down the state

58:44.652 --> 58:45.918
looking for her now.

58:45.920 --> 58:47.656
What was she doing here anyway?
Was she hurt?

58:47.989 --> 58:49.925
How did she get away
from you people?

58:50.659 --> 58:52.829
Can anybody tell me anything
about my sister?

58:57.333 --> 59:02.572
"Your completed, properly
formatted, printed script

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.887
My script.

01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:29.257
It's gone.

01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:31.160
It's gone.

01:00:47.775 --> 01:00:48.911
"Captain...

01:00:50.077 --> 01:00:53.682
there is only one logical
direction in which to go...

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:56.918
Forward."

01:02:02.851 --> 01:02:04.387

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.019

01:03:17.592 --> 01:03:19.959
Do I need a ticket
to ride the bus to Los Angeles?

01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:21.193
Yes, you do.

01:03:21.195 --> 01:03:24.296
But the next one is not
until 8:00 am tomorrow.

01:03:24.298 --> 01:03:25.268
I'm sorry.

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:30.072
8:00 am is in
11 hours and 13 minutes.

01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:32.574
I'll wait.

01:04:20.621 --> 01:04:22.324
Silence.

01:04:34.001 --> 01:04:35.471
I hope she's okay.

01:04:36.637 --> 01:04:38.607
She's a very resourceful girl.

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:41.877
To tell you the truth,
I'm kind of impressed.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:43.913
She used to be afraid
of everything.

01:04:44.112 --> 01:04:45.882
This can't be easy for her.

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:49.551
Maybe I underestimated her.

01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:52.188
Your sister...

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:56.626
is one of the most complex
and creative people I know.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.094
Yeah.

01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:01.260
I mean, she's not always
that easy to figure out.

01:05:01.262 --> 01:05:04.366
She can really try
your patience, that's for sure.

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:05.500
Yeah.

01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:07.936
My mother
was so patient with her.

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.909
She took care of both of us,
by herself.

01:05:13.574 --> 01:05:15.076
- Single mom?
- Yeah.

01:05:16.143 --> 01:05:17.212
Yeah.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.016
After our mother died,
I tried my best

01:05:24.018 --> 01:05:25.287
to take care of Wendy.

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.420
But then I got married,

01:05:28.422 --> 01:05:30.292
we found out
we were gonna have a baby.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.099
I'm always amazed by how easy
it is for some people

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.936
to be able to handle it all.

01:05:54.115 --> 01:05:55.184
Miss?

01:05:56.418 --> 01:05:57.152
Miss?

01:05:58.085 --> 01:06:00.588
I'm sorry,
but I need to close up.

01:06:05.092 --> 01:06:06.628
Do you have any place to go?

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:10.266
Paramount Pictures.

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:14.436
Can I wait outside for the bus
to Los Angeles?

01:06:14.735 --> 01:06:17.105
Well, I can't stop you.

01:06:19.641 --> 01:06:21.577
But you be careful, okay?

01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:24.713
I am careful.

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:28.117
I don't walk when the sign says,
"Don't walk", and...

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.987
I only crossed
Market Street one time.

01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:33.388
Okay.

01:07:24.172 --> 01:07:25.574
Go into bathroom.

01:07:26.407 --> 01:07:27.643
Take a shower.

01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:31.047
There is no shower.

01:07:31.545 --> 01:07:32.580
That's okay.

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:35.150
It's okay to skip once,
but not twice.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.452
Madeline said so.

01:07:38.452 --> 01:07:39.554
I've got to change.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:46.860
I need to buy a ticket
to Los Angeles, please.

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.731
That'll be 22 dollars.

01:07:56.804 --> 01:07:58.804
That's not going
to be enough money.

01:07:58.806 --> 01:08:01.376
It's $7.52, I counted it.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:04.579
- Next.
- But it's almost enough.

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:08.248
I need to get
to Los Angeles today

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.751
because today is
the contest deadline.

01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:13.887
$7.52 is not enough, I know,
but is there some way that...

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:16.192
Next customer, please.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:18.359
Can it be enough?
Please.

01:08:19.327 --> 01:08:20.362
Just for today?

01:08:20.493 --> 01:08:22.096
You're holding up the line.

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:24.100
Let's keep moving.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.135
Any news?

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:04.200
Where do you get on
the Lankershim bus?

01:10:09.671 --> 01:10:10.739
That her?

01:10:13.707 --> 01:10:15.607
Do you know where you get on
the Lankershim bus?

01:10:15.609 --> 01:10:16.744
That's her.

01:10:21.815 --> 01:10:22.885
Hey, miss?

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.252
Miss?

01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:27.890
Hey! Hey!

01:10:28.055 --> 01:10:29.224
Stop!

01:10:29.356 --> 01:10:30.893
Back in, back in, back in.

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.828
All right, all right.

01:11:32.386 --> 01:11:33.389
Wendy.

01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:34.889
Wendy.

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:38.661
Wendy, come out.
We won't hurt you.

01:11:38.926 --> 01:11:40.826
- I think she's in there.
- Just, just...

01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:41.963
You'll spook her, okay?

01:11:52.673 --> 01:11:53.708
Wendy.

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:55.844
Wendy!

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:58.039
Hey, man, what language is that?

01:12:58.172 --> 01:13:00.108
Forget about it, Doyle.
It's nothing, okay?

01:13:00.475 --> 01:13:02.378
I didn't know you spoke
a foreign language, bro.

01:13:02.543 --> 01:13:03.612
What was that?

01:13:03.778 --> 01:13:05.681
Klingon, all right?

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.783
- Damn!
- Shut up, Doyle.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.654
Yes, I speak English.

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.027
They found her!

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.760
She's at a police station
in downtown L.A.

01:13:21.762 --> 01:13:22.597
Sam!

01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:26.135
<i>So, what happens next?</i>

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:29.070
Spock starts to experience
the <i>pon farr.</i>

01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:32.807
On top of everything else
he's going through?

01:13:33.006 --> 01:13:34.041
Yes.

01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:36.709
And all of his emotions
rise to the surface

01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:38.544
and they start
tearing him apart,

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:40.816
and he has to figure out
how to control them.

01:13:41.815 --> 01:13:43.249
That's amazing.

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:45.020
That's amazing!

01:13:50.725 --> 01:13:52.561
But I'm not going to make it.

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:55.096
There's still
over 100 pages missing.

01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:59.735
Oh, Wendy.

01:14:00.534 --> 01:14:01.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:05.807
I've been so worried about you.

01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:15.451
Oh, God, we were worried
sick about you!

01:14:15.716 --> 01:14:17.585
What did we say
about crossing Market Street?

01:14:17.752 --> 01:14:20.456
I'm not allowed to cross Market
Street under any circumstances.

01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:21.823
We found your script.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.060
We can still make it.

01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:31.466
<i>Qapla',</i> Wendy.

01:14:34.234 --> 01:14:36.737
<i>Qapla',</i> Frank, yaS.

01:14:40.073 --> 01:14:42.478
Hey, I really liked your script.

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:44.079
Thank you.

01:14:44.645 --> 01:14:47.248
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
it was really good.

01:14:47.614 --> 01:14:49.882
When Spock has to
travel back in time

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:51.854
with the Elixir of Light
to save everyone,

01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:55.021
he sees all these people
that he loves die, right?

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.555
Even Kirk.

01:14:56.557 --> 01:14:58.790
And he wants to save
all of them, too, but he can't,

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.862
because he knows
they died for something good.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.765
I really think it could win.

01:15:13.173 --> 01:15:14.643
You need to get over.

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:24.750
Did you get that peanut butter

01:15:24.752 --> 01:15:26.521
and jelly sandwich
that I left you?

01:15:28.288 --> 01:15:29.791
I missed you a lot.

01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:46.542
Mom, it's right here.
Turn here.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:49.176
There it is!
Stop the car!

01:15:50.944 --> 01:15:52.680
- Wendy! Stop!
- Go, Wendy!

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.082
No, let her go.
She'll be okay.

01:16:03.323 --> 01:16:04.826
I can't walk.

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:36.257
Everyone stay
in the group, please.

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:42.730
Now, over here is the soundstage
where they shot "Indiana Jones."

01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:45.000
Excuse me.

01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:47.835
Do you know where
Building 1500 is?

01:16:48.002 --> 01:16:50.272
Yeah, it's just up
and to the right.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.663
Where are you going?

01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:50.064
I need to drop off my script.

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:52.667
Ah, yeah, you can't
drop that off here.

01:17:54.268 --> 01:17:57.773
"Your script must be received
by February 16th at 5:00 pm."

01:17:58.038 --> 01:18:00.242
Yes, and we only accept
entries by mail.

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:01.475
Okay?

01:18:05.345 --> 01:18:07.048
But this is the mailroom.

01:18:09.182 --> 01:18:10.217
Look...

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.454
We don't accept
personal deliveries.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.224
All scripts must be
postmarked and mailed.

01:18:16.423 --> 01:18:18.225
No exceptions, okay?

01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:26.967
Piece of shit...

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:33.341
Do you know how hard it is
to write something?

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:39.881
Do you know how hard it is
to write something?

01:18:43.016 --> 01:18:45.252
Do you know how hard it is
to write something?

01:18:45.552 --> 01:18:47.956
Do you know how hard it is
to write something?

01:18:48.823 --> 01:18:50.025
All the thinking and planning

01:18:50.224 --> 01:18:52.090
and re-writing of everything
you already wrote

01:18:52.092 --> 01:18:53.394
for somebody else to read?

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.997
All the nights and days
spent thinking?

01:18:56.831 --> 01:18:58.397
Thinking about
the right words to say...

01:18:58.399 --> 01:19:00.135
thinking about the best way
to say them?

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.472
Because the story you wanna tell
means so much to you?

01:19:05.405 --> 01:19:07.042
All those people that
wrote those scripts,

01:19:07.207 --> 01:19:08.375
somebody's going to read them.

01:19:10.243 --> 01:19:12.012
And I just want a chance!

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.750
Just like everyone else got!

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:22.224
Somebody call security.

01:19:25.025 --> 01:19:26.394
Do you know who I am?

01:19:26.894 --> 01:19:28.262
What did you just say?

01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:30.765
Do you know who I am?

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:33.168
No.

01:19:34.601 --> 01:19:35.770
Good.

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:37.068
Hey!

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.140
Hey, stop!

01:19:38.305 --> 01:19:39.306
Thanks.

01:20:28.322 --> 01:20:29.490
So did it get in?

01:20:29.657 --> 01:20:30.958
Oh, Wendy!

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.362
Wendy, you did it!

01:20:34.628 --> 01:20:35.596
Oh, my God!

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.634
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:13.466 --> 01:21:14.536
Bye.

01:21:33.253 --> 01:21:35.122
I'm so proud of you.

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:38.493
You turned in that script
all by yourself.

01:21:39.393 --> 01:21:41.162
You said you wanted
to show them...

01:21:41.662 --> 01:21:43.131
and you did.

01:21:44.497 --> 01:21:46.268
But I wanted to show you.

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.141
Yeah.

01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.581
My iPod was stolen.

01:22:01.649 --> 01:22:03.385
I'll get you a new one.

01:22:04.385 --> 01:22:05.420
You will?

01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:10.225
I'd really appreciate that.

01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:20.068
Wendy, I've been thinking...

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.202
And...

01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:26.073
I've been trying
to figure out...

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:30.945
what Mom would have
wanted for us.

01:22:31.779 --> 01:22:33.348
Well, Mom's dead.

01:22:34.347 --> 01:22:37.118
So, she doesn't want
anything anymore.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:01.343
<i>"'Come on, Captain.
We can do this together.</i>

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.511
<i>Don't give up now.'</i>

01:23:05.145 --> 01:23:07.349
<i>Their final moment had come.</i>

01:23:08.114 --> 01:23:09.516
<i>There was no going back.</i>

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:14.122
<i>With his dying breath,
Kirk lifts his visor.</i>

01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:18.460
<i>Spock looks into his friend's
eyes for the last time.</i>

01:23:20.094 --> 01:23:23.264
<i>Kirk knows it is time
to set Spock free.</i>

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.001
<i>Free to find his human heart.</i>

01:23:27.368 --> 01:23:28.503
<i>The End."</i>

01:23:34.475 --> 01:23:36.044
Epilogue.

01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:39.414
Everything would be okay.

01:23:41.114 --> 01:23:42.684
Scottie had said so.

01:23:45.552 --> 01:23:47.619
But where was
that tiny speck of light

01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:49.423
traveling through the universe?

01:23:51.391 --> 01:23:53.293
Different from the others...

01:23:55.395 --> 01:23:57.431
hoping to get where it's going?

01:23:59.399 --> 01:24:01.168
To where it belongs?

01:24:08.274 --> 01:24:09.643
<i>"Dear Wendy...</i>

01:24:10.877 --> 01:24:12.244

You're an excellent writer.

You really are.

01:24:35.569 --> 01:24:36.838
Thank you, Scottie.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.742

01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:59.194
This is for you.

01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:02.197
Jeez, thanks.

01:25:02.395 --> 01:25:03.564
Uh, hey...

01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:06.100
Did you ever turn your script
into the contest?

01:25:08.569 --> 01:25:10.238
When will you find out
if you've won?

01:25:10.404 --> 01:25:11.473
Soon.

01:25:12.238 --> 01:25:14.108
- Fingers crossed.
- Fingers crossed.
