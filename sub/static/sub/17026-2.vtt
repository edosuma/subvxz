WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:05.640
New Knorr Stockpot tastes like stock
made from scratch.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.800
The best thing to happen to cooking
since me.

00:09.800 --> 00:14.000
Fact: The flu virus can live
on surfaces for up to two days.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.120
And flu, like other germs,

00:16.200 --> 00:18.040
can transfer in an instant.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.880
Fact: Dettol Disinfectant Spray
kills 99.9% of germs

00:22.960 --> 00:24.360
that can cause tummy upsets

00:24.440 --> 00:25.840
and runny noses.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.720
Rebecca!

00:31.880 --> 00:34.160
I have to tell you,
that looks absolutely exhausting!

00:34.320 --> 00:36.879
Is it disappointing to you
that you do this strenuous stuff

00:37.039 --> 00:38.919
and yet your cholesterol
is still raised?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.319
Well, yes. Yes, it is.

00:40.479 --> 00:42.079
As you know,
I was quite taken aback.

00:42.239 --> 00:44.679
So in total, then, what differences
have you made every day?

00:44.839 --> 00:47.159
I've introduced
the pro.activ drinks.

00:47.319 --> 00:48.999
So I have one of those
with a meal every day.

00:49.159 --> 00:50.879
I'm having
my three portions a day.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.599
My yoghurt in the morning,

00:52.719 --> 00:54.359
milk in my tea all day long,

00:54.519 --> 00:57.679
and I'll have the spread
on baked potato or toast.

00:57.839 --> 00:59.439
It's just part of the day,
part of my life.

00:59.599 --> 01:03.199
You too can reduce your cholesterol
level with Flora pro.activ.

01:03.359 --> 01:05.919
But have our volunteers
managed to reduce theirs?

01:06.039 --> 01:08.239
Join us next week and find out.

01:10.639 --> 01:13.839
Look at this!
Would you ever have a facelift?

01:13.839 --> 01:16.359
You mean like this?
Are you kidding?

01:16.359 --> 01:20.799
At 50, I have my own lift expert.
Oh, tell me!

01:20.799 --> 01:24.959
New Nivea Visage Expert Lift
Day Cream Anti-Sagging System

01:24.959 --> 01:27.879
For smoother,
noticeably younger looking skin

01:27.879 --> 01:30.039
that you can see and feel,
with...

01:35.399 --> 01:36.879
It works for me!
Because...

02:30.678 --> 02:33.638
'Gas, leccy, insurance...' Oh.

02:33.638 --> 02:35.398
'Letter from Jane.'

02:35.398 --> 02:37.078
'I think I'll do these first.'

02:37.078 --> 02:38.718
0870...

02:38.718 --> 02:40.758
0845...

02:40.758 --> 02:43.598
'As if it wasn't bad enough having
to make these calls...' Quotes.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.718
..I have to PAY to make them!'

02:45.718 --> 02:47.558
Unlike with most companies

02:47.558 --> 02:51.718
calls to 0845 and 0870 numbers
are now free with BT. Free!

02:51.718 --> 02:53.278
Hi, Jane.

02:53.278 --> 02:55.718
Um, the answer's yes.

00:01.997 --> 00:03.477
Previously on ER...

04:58.477 --> 05:00.877
Are you a sociopath?
a sadist? Stoned?

05:00.877 --> 05:02.557
I heard that
you were tightly wound,

05:02.557 --> 05:03.757
but I had no idea.

05:03.757 --> 05:05.717
What am I giving up,
a dumpy OR?

05:05.717 --> 05:07.157
Overnight call?
below-market pay?

05:07.157 --> 05:09.037
This is not what you want.

05:09.037 --> 05:10.397
Everything was
going really well

05:10.397 --> 05:11.837
till the ambulance blew up.

05:11.837 --> 05:12.997
Morris...

05:12.997 --> 05:14.517
don't screw this up.

05:14.517 --> 05:15.637
There's an open artery.

05:15.637 --> 05:16.957
I can either let
him bleed out

05:16.957 --> 05:18.157
or we can accept
the risk of a stroke.

05:18.157 --> 05:19.277
MORRIS: His heart's gone.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.277
His brain's gone.

05:20.277 --> 05:21.757
We're pronouncing him.

05:21.757 --> 05:23.797
He was going to be
the chief of the ER.

05:23.797 --> 05:26.036
We embrace the memory
of our colleague

05:26.036 --> 05:27.076
and our dear friend.

05:32.196 --> 05:35.156
MORRIS: Helipad access,
ortho supplies, suture cart.

05:36.916 --> 05:40.276
Nurses' station,
drug lockup, call room.

05:40.276 --> 05:41.356
There's a call room?

05:41.356 --> 05:42.716
Yeah, but don't
plan on sleeping.

05:42.716 --> 05:44.596
Oh, I didn't
come here to sleep.

05:44.596 --> 05:46.196
Don't be snarky.
We just got here.

05:46.196 --> 05:47.196
Nice dress.

05:47.196 --> 05:48.716
Oh, Barney's sale,
1,800 bucks,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.076
got it for four, I love that.

05:50.076 --> 05:52.316
OK, these
are the trauma rooms.

05:52.316 --> 05:55.116
Take some time to familiarise
yourself with the equipment.

05:55.116 --> 05:57.116
Ah, the new interns.
Welcome to County.

05:57.116 --> 05:59.036
Those are some shoes.

05:59.036 --> 06:01.996
Oh, I always wear heels.
Anything else hurts my feet.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.076
ALARM BEEPS

06:11.316 --> 06:14.396
Everybody get a chance
to look around Chicago?

06:14.396 --> 06:16.356
No, we were at a friend's
wedding in Denver yesterday.

06:16.356 --> 06:17.556
Drove all night.

06:17.556 --> 06:18.596
Yeah, I washed my hair

06:18.596 --> 06:20.996
in a gas station sink
and I came straight here.

06:20.996 --> 06:23.116
Hmm. Uh, you're
from Texas, right?

06:23.116 --> 06:24.596
Went to med school
in San Antonio,

06:24.596 --> 06:25.676
but I'm from New York.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.996
Ah, muy bien.

06:26.996 --> 06:28.636
Sabes bailar el two step?

06:28.636 --> 06:30.476
Er...I don't speak Spanish.

06:30.476 --> 06:32.756
Oh.

06:32.756 --> 06:34.836
Ah! everybody meet
Dr Tony Gates,

06:34.836 --> 06:37.636
third-year resident, and
Sam Taggart, one of our nurses.

06:37.636 --> 06:39.076
Gates oversees you, >

06:39.076 --> 06:41.116
I supervise him, and Sam's
got her eye on all of us.

06:41.116 --> 06:42.556
Be careful
or she'll kick your ass.

06:42.556 --> 06:43.676
Trust him, he knows.

06:48.196 --> 06:50.836
GRUNTING

06:50.836 --> 06:53.156
A GRUNT
SMASHING

06:53.156 --> 06:55.676
Charts, forms, lab recs...
it's all here.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.396
Is this...? Are these
who I think they are?

06:58.396 --> 07:01.075
My friend, it's true.
Your replacements have arrived.

07:01.075 --> 07:02.275
Tracy Martin, it's nice to meet...

07:02.275 --> 07:03.595
Oh, thank you, God!

07:03.595 --> 07:05.635
I'm not an intern anymore.

07:05.635 --> 07:07.675
Kaya, come meet
your partners in crime.

07:07.675 --> 07:09.995
Hey, you guys.

07:09.995 --> 07:10.955
How's it going?

07:10.955 --> 07:12.275
You're an intern, too?

07:12.275 --> 07:14.195
Yep. Skipped the orientation.

07:14.195 --> 07:16.275
Y'all need to get your newbie
behinds down to personnel.

07:16.275 --> 07:17.795
You can't work without ID

07:17.795 --> 07:20.275
And this is Frank.
Donuts will make him your friend.

07:20.275 --> 07:21.955
Avoid coconut, it gives him gas.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.395
You can say that again.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.475
Hi, I'm Tracy Martin

07:30.475 --> 07:32.515
and I'm an intern
in the emergency department.

07:33.715 --> 07:35.035
Oh, wait! I need a touch-up.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.715
Andrew Wade -
intern, general surgery.

07:42.115 --> 07:43.475
Surgeon, wow.

07:43.475 --> 07:44.395
Yeah.

07:48.715 --> 07:51.995
Daria Wade, intern,
emergency department.

07:54.915 --> 07:57.875
I should really go find where
I'm supposed to be right now.

07:57.875 --> 07:58.435
Call you later.

07:58.435 --> 07:59.435
Honey, yeah, I know.

08:05.555 --> 08:07.235
I gotta go now. I love you, bye.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.435
Ryan Sanchez, intern.

08:11.155 --> 08:12.875
My wife, she's home with the kids.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.515
Still getting used
to the new place.

08:14.515 --> 08:16.635
PHONE RINGS
Hello?

08:16.635 --> 08:18.355
I did my MBA
while I was at Stanford.

08:18.355 --> 08:20.035
The programme there is real...

08:20.915 --> 08:23.075
Hold on. I wasn't ready.

08:23.075 --> 08:24.675
WOMAN: That's enough, you're done.

08:28.595 --> 08:29.915
Put the little penis away.

08:31.595 --> 08:35.155
And you... You're a doctor now.

08:35.155 --> 08:37.354
Try to look like one.

08:37.354 --> 08:41.433
And on that note, three-inch heels
have no place in the hospital.

08:42.874 --> 08:45.634
Catherine Banfield,
attending physician,

08:45.634 --> 08:47.434
Chief of the ER.

08:47.434 --> 08:49.194
Hello, everyone.

08:49.194 --> 08:51.354
I'm your new boss.

11:26.713 --> 11:27.913
We're staying here?

11:28.513 --> 11:30.353
Have I ever
let you down?

11:31.193 --> 11:32.033
THUNDER

11:32.153 --> 11:33.393
(whimpers)

11:33.513 --> 11:35.393
Trust me, this is big-time!

11:36.193 --> 11:37.273
Good afternoon, sir.

11:37.393 --> 11:38.553
It is now.

11:39.553 --> 11:42.113
Ah! Now, that's what
I'm talking about. (chuckles)

11:42.233 --> 11:44.073
I love you too, baby!

11:44.233 --> 11:46.713
Fantastic. And just some bread
for my companion, please.

11:47.513 --> 11:49.673
Hey! I found something small-time.

11:50.313 --> 11:51.352
The bill!

11:52.192 --> 11:53.152
Premier Inn.

11:55.952 --> 11:58.152
There's now
up to:

11:58.352 --> 12:01.232
our range of 27
beautiful kitchens.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.512
This offer's got
our name on it.

12:35.832 --> 12:36.912
Miners' strike!

12:37.032 --> 12:38.232
Miners' strike!

12:38.352 --> 12:39.592
Look, I'm running out of battery,

12:39.752 --> 12:43.152
so send me a telex with the figures
and I'll digest them in Frankfurt.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.232
# INTRO TO "RELAX"
BY FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD

13:16.512 --> 13:17.712
I need to change my job.

13:18.512 --> 13:19.872
I need to change my ticket.

14:16.631 --> 14:18.551
We see an average of
250 patients a day,

14:18.551 --> 14:20.191
300 if it gets crazy.

14:20.191 --> 14:21.351
A few years in this place,
you can handle anything.

14:21.351 --> 14:22.911
I'm sure.

14:22.911 --> 14:24.471
So what made you come
back from Indonesia?

14:24.471 --> 14:26.671
It was time. Chicago's home.

14:26.671 --> 14:28.711
I don't get the whole
medical mission thing.

14:28.711 --> 14:32.591
Why chase tragedy overseas when we've
got disaster right at our front door?

14:32.591 --> 14:35.711
It's not for everyone. I thought
the nurse ratio was four to one.

14:35.711 --> 14:37.711
My ex went on a medical mission.
Total mistake.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.271
Where are all the nurses?
Doesn't look four-to-one around here.

14:40.271 --> 14:41.791
HALEH: We're short, as usual.

14:41.791 --> 14:44.111
This is Haleh Adams,
our charge nurse.

14:44.111 --> 14:46.271
Haleh, meet Dr Banfield,
our new chief.

14:46.271 --> 14:47.111
Welcome to County.
Coffee anyone?

14:47.111 --> 14:49.351
I'm not into coffee, it's a crutch.

14:49.351 --> 14:51.071
Uh, meet me to run
the board in five minutes.

14:51.071 --> 14:53.431
Do I know you? You look so familiar.

14:53.431 --> 14:54.631
I don't think so.

14:54.631 --> 14:57.471
Ever work at St Mark's?
I pick up shifts there sometimes.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.431
No.
Moonlight in urgent care?

14:59.431 --> 15:01.351
You know, I could swear
I've seen you before.

15:01.351 --> 15:03.270
No, it's my first day.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.750
Well, if there's anything you need
to know about this place, just ask.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.350
Cuticle cream?

15:11.350 --> 15:13.790
Latex gloves are murder
on your hands.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.550
Do you think
this used to be a sandwich?

15:15.550 --> 15:18.310
You guys get settled,
meet me out at the desk.

15:20.630 --> 15:21.910
You OK?

15:21.910 --> 15:23.590
Yeah.
HE CLEARS THROAT

15:23.590 --> 15:25.230
You've been here for,
like, 96 hours straight.

15:25.230 --> 15:28.190
We're a little short
staffed right now.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.270
Us, too. Abby took
a few days off with Luka

15:30.270 --> 15:31.590
and you look like crap.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.590
Look who's talking.
You live here.

15:33.590 --> 15:34.470
Well, it's easier
than going home.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.950
Sleep is overrated.
Another day, bring it on.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.990
These patients have been
on the board since yesterday.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.470
The hospital's full.
They never discharge at night.

15:40.470 --> 15:42.710
Which makes it impossible
to admit anyone.

15:42.710 --> 15:45.190
I'm friendly with the nursing
supervisor on med/surge.

15:45.190 --> 15:46.230
I bet you are.

15:46.230 --> 15:47.990
She can always find a bed for me.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.510
You get her to open things up?

15:49.510 --> 15:50.910
Lubricate the logjam?

15:50.910 --> 15:52.790
Do it.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.710
Oh, Dr Banfield.

15:54.710 --> 15:56.550
I just wanted to let you know,

15:56.550 --> 15:58.430
I have to take off
a little early tonight.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.950
I'm starting the nurse
anaesthetist programme,

16:00.950 --> 16:02.710
and I have to drop my kid
off at a friend's house.

16:02.710 --> 16:05.430
Leave when your shift's over. I'm
kind of a stickler for that, Sam.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.470
It is Sam, right?

16:06.470 --> 16:08.830
Yeah. It's only like 20 minutes.

16:08.830 --> 16:12.470
We all have commitments, just don't
let them bleed into your work.

16:13.550 --> 16:16.150
Wow, new chief seems great.

16:16.150 --> 16:18.550
Alex can hang out with me
and Sarah tonight.

16:18.550 --> 16:19.550
Really?
Yeah.

16:19.550 --> 16:21.550
He's been home all week.
I don't want him to be alone.

16:21.550 --> 16:22.990
No problem, I'll pick
him up after work.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.870
Thank you, Tony. It's a big help.

16:24.870 --> 16:26.270
MORRIS: James Silcott, 26,

16:26.270 --> 16:30.510
burns and minor trauma from a
chemical explosion in an apartment
next to theirs.

16:30.510 --> 16:33.350
Decca Richards, 24, same explosion.
Complaining of abdominal pain.

16:33.350 --> 16:35.430
Baby, you OK?
Yeah, I think so.

16:35.430 --> 16:37.070
I'm Dr Gates. What happened?

16:37.070 --> 16:38.430
We were reading
on the couch when boom!

16:38.430 --> 16:40.469
This blast just came
through the walls.

16:40.469 --> 16:41.589
Both trauma rooms are open.

16:41.589 --> 16:44.829
BRENNER: OK, Kaya, with Dr Morris.
Gates, with me. Trauma one, let's go.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.109
Follow me.

16:46.109 --> 16:47.909
You're gonna be right
next door, OK?

16:47.909 --> 16:49.829
I'll bounce between and supervise.

16:49.829 --> 16:51.749
For attendings we don't
need to be supervised.

16:51.749 --> 16:54.309
Just watch this time,
get a sense of how things go.

16:54.309 --> 16:56.029
Screw that.

16:56.029 --> 16:57.749
TAGGART: 18 gauge in the NQ.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.709
KAYA: Tachy at 118,
pulses are good.

16:59.709 --> 17:02.789
MORRIS: Second degree burns to chest
and arm. Kaya, let surgery know.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.868
All right, on my count -
one, two, three...

17:05.868 --> 17:07.108
TAGGART: What exploded?

17:07.108 --> 17:09.589
Don't know, just heard
this breaking glass.

17:09.589 --> 17:12.189
Probably like his meth lab
or something - guy's a freak.

17:12.189 --> 17:14.148
Sam, haemocue, trauma panel,
type and cross.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.309
Why the ultrasound?

17:15.309 --> 17:17.469
Explosion, blunt trauma-
that's why.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.709
KAYA: How's your pain?

17:18.709 --> 17:21.189
JAMES: It's pretty bad.
My arm's killing me.

17:21.189 --> 17:22.509
We can get you
something for that.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.469
Five of MS,
titrate up from there.

17:24.469 --> 17:27.549
Get another set of vitals before you
go drop his pressure with narcotics.

17:27.549 --> 17:28.549
Is Decca OK?

17:28.549 --> 17:30.709
BANFIELD: I'll go check.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.229
Good idea.

17:35.029 --> 17:37.549
GATES: So what kind of music
does your band play?

17:37.549 --> 17:41.229
It's hard to explain. Imagine
a punk version of '40s standards.

17:41.229 --> 17:44.469
That makes no sense.
OK, no fluid, looks good.

17:44.469 --> 17:46.509
You'll have to come
check it out sometime. Ow!

17:46.509 --> 17:47.469
Sorry.

17:47.469 --> 17:48.469
Do you want me to try?

17:48.469 --> 17:50.349
I said stand back and watch.

17:50.349 --> 17:54.549
GATES: I had a band once.
Bunch of sexually frustrated
adolescent boys.

17:54.549 --> 17:55.909
All right, IV's in.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.949
Hang a litre.

17:56.949 --> 17:57.869
Litre of what?

17:59.549 --> 18:00.109
Normal saline.

18:00.109 --> 18:00.949
So be clear.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.389
Everyone knew what he meant.

18:02.389 --> 18:04.989
We knew one song,
You Got Lucky by Tom Petty

18:04.989 --> 18:07.869
and we played it over and
over again in this guy's garage.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.469
# You got lucky, babe

18:09.469 --> 18:11.589
# You got lucky, babe

18:11.589 --> 18:13.949
# When I found you. #

18:13.949 --> 18:16.148
Over and over again.
I'm not kidding you.

18:16.148 --> 18:17.388
It was sad.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.828
You have a patient on the table.

18:18.828 --> 18:20.508
A stable patient.
It's cool, really.

18:20.508 --> 18:22.548
A trauma case can turn on a dime.

18:22.548 --> 18:23.908
I know that. We're good here.

18:23.908 --> 18:27.428
Every single patient that comes in
that door is my responsibility

18:27.428 --> 18:30.788
and I have to know that
I can trust your judgment.

18:32.148 --> 18:37.308
CRENSHAW: I'm sorry
for calling so early, but I've got

18:37.308 --> 18:40.188
DUBENKO: You know what?
You gotta stop doing this, Dusty.

18:40.188 --> 18:43.468
Would you jump straight to
pancreaticojejunal anastomosis

18:43.468 --> 18:45.628
or do a sphincteroplasty first?

18:45.628 --> 18:48.188
If the proximal duct is open,
option one, otherwise two.

18:48.188 --> 18:51.108
Intermittent dilation,
go with a Puestow procedure.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.068
You are my hero.

18:52.068 --> 18:53.388
'Yeah, yeah, I know.'

18:53.388 --> 18:56.708
I gotta run.
I'm doing grand rounds at Rush.

18:58.988 --> 19:00.228
Dr Crenshaw?
What?!

19:00.228 --> 19:02.388
Oh, finally,
I've been looking for you.

19:02.388 --> 19:05.668
Andrew Wade, new surgical intern.
I'm supposed to shadow you today.

19:05.668 --> 19:07.348
Is black OK?

19:07.348 --> 19:09.308
Fantastic.

19:11.668 --> 19:12.708
Where is she?

19:12.708 --> 19:15.188
You probably should be
getting back to work.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.828
It's my day off. I only
came in because I wanted to...

19:17.828 --> 19:19.708
Neela, I know where
this is going.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.668
But Lucien's a fantastic
teacher, and the patients love him.

19:22.668 --> 19:24.108
And he's an amazing
trauma surgeon.

19:24.108 --> 19:25.308
I don't disagree.

19:25.308 --> 19:26.548
Well, then how can
you let him leave?

19:26.548 --> 19:29.388
I don't like it either,
but he forced our hand.

19:29.388 --> 19:30.628
He was upset.
He didn't mean...

19:30.628 --> 19:32.628
The board voted for dismissal.

19:32.628 --> 19:33.748
It's done.

19:33.748 --> 19:37.908
MORRIS: Listen, Captain Haemolysis,
you use the same excuse every time.

19:37.908 --> 19:39.948
Spare me
the dog-ate-my-homework crap,

19:39.948 --> 19:42.428
and get me the damn
potassium level, thank you.

19:42.428 --> 19:44.348
Impossible to get
anything done around here!

19:44.348 --> 19:45.948
You OK?

19:45.948 --> 19:47.828
Yeah.

19:47.828 --> 19:50.108
When was the last time
you had a day off?

19:50.108 --> 19:55.107
I got a guy with bullous pemphigoid
in curtain three, you should
check it out.

19:56.387 --> 19:59.347
Why don't you get out of here for
a while? It'll be good for you.

19:59.347 --> 20:01.907
Hey, I need you to sign off
on a bunch of stuff.

20:01.907 --> 20:03.547
I'm all yours.

20:05.427 --> 20:08.427
One of the nurses had me
order bactrim on tricycle girl.

20:08.427 --> 20:10.107
Is that approved for kids?

20:10.107 --> 20:12.147
You're missing the point.
She asked me.

20:12.147 --> 20:14.267
Didn't need my order
cosigned or anything.

20:14.267 --> 20:17.187
Hallelujah, I am so sick of
getting my orders co-signed.

20:17.187 --> 20:19.587
I'm just saying, there's always
been someone double-checking

20:19.587 --> 20:21.747
our decisions.
Making sure we didn't mess up.

20:21.747 --> 20:24.107
Now you're feeling like you're
flying without a net, right?

20:24.107 --> 20:25.507
Exactly.

20:25.507 --> 20:27.347
Completely normal.

20:27.347 --> 20:29.627
Yeah, all this
responsibility, I mean...

20:31.027 --> 20:33.787
I want it, it's just a little scary.

20:33.787 --> 20:34.947
Hmph!
What?

20:34.947 --> 20:37.907
Well, if you're not ready,
then you shouldn't be here.

20:37.907 --> 20:40.387
You're all ready, it just takes a
little time to grow into this job.

20:40.387 --> 20:41.867
You have complete backup.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.587
No-one expects you to run
a code the first day.

20:44.587 --> 20:46.787
Now, come on,
let's start with the basics.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.027
Fever with a murmur.

20:48.027 --> 20:49.187
What's the workup?

20:49.187 --> 20:50.827
TAGGART: Surgery wants to admit

20:50.827 --> 20:52.867
the explosion couple
for observation,

20:52.867 --> 20:53.667
but they have no beds.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.107
What else is new?
OK, park them in the hallway.

20:56.107 --> 20:58.107
I'll write orders for
vitals and fluids.

20:58.107 --> 20:59.667
Hey. See this guy, will you?

20:59.667 --> 21:01.987
He's been waiting
five hours already now.

21:01.987 --> 21:05.147
Oh, sorry, Frank. We were eating
bonbons in a bubble bath.

21:05.147 --> 21:07.547
Totally lost track of time.
Go say hi.

21:09.787 --> 21:11.347
TAGGART: Hey, I'm Sam.

21:11.347 --> 21:12.907
I'm one of the nurses.

21:12.907 --> 21:15.827
Finally - I was ready
to give up on you guys.

21:15.827 --> 21:17.427
Check this out.

21:17.427 --> 21:19.827
Do I have flesh-eating bacteria?

21:19.827 --> 21:21.467
No, I don't think so.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.747
But, I'll have one of
the doctors take a look at it.

21:23.747 --> 21:27.027
How long will it take? I got a test
tomorrow, I can't be here all night.

21:27.027 --> 21:28.986
And if it were up to you,
what would you do?

21:30.426 --> 21:32.626
I just got here 30 seconds ago.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.226
Sometimes, that's all you get.

21:34.226 --> 21:38.106
OK, um...severe cellulitis,

21:38.106 --> 21:40.226
IV antibiotics.

21:40.226 --> 21:41.306
What kind?

21:41.306 --> 21:42.386
I don't know. Um...

21:42.386 --> 21:43.626
Ancef?

21:43.626 --> 21:45.866
No, IV Vanco to cover the MRSA.

21:45.866 --> 21:48.906
And don't answer a question
with a question - I hate that.

21:51.986 --> 21:53.986
Well, you gonna
give me some medicine?

21:53.986 --> 21:55.066
What was that?

21:55.066 --> 21:57.026
Just trying to get
a sense of how you think

21:57.026 --> 21:58.426
and what you're capable of.

21:58.426 --> 22:00.066
Oh, well, that's kind of hard

22:00.066 --> 22:01.586
to come up with
a plan on the fly...

22:01.586 --> 22:03.306
Hard? You're an ER nurse.

22:03.306 --> 22:05.506
You're the first line against
gunshot wounds, stabbings -

22:05.506 --> 22:06.826
you scrape brain off your shoes.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.546
Think a little
bedside teaching's hard?

22:08.546 --> 22:10.586
40-something male, found
by the explosion site.

22:10.586 --> 22:11.666
I don't want this! Let me go!

22:11.666 --> 22:13.586
Your leg's broken, you can't walk.
Minor burns to the neck and torso,

22:13.586 --> 22:14.866
probable tib/fib on the left.

22:14.866 --> 22:17.346
All right, Gates, take this
with the interns. I'll be right in.

22:17.346 --> 22:18.986
Listen to me! Why won't
you listen to me?!

22:18.986 --> 22:20.106
- Can I run it?
- No. I'm Dr Gates...

22:20.106 --> 22:22.226
I don't need a doctor!
RYAN: What's your name, sir?

22:22.226 --> 22:24.186
I don't want this!
DARIA: We gotta call you something.

22:24.186 --> 22:26.186
Felix! you don't know
what you're messing with!

22:26.186 --> 22:27.626
Airway's good, he's breathing.

22:27.626 --> 22:30.106
But he's really tachypneic.
Could be edema from the fire.

22:30.106 --> 22:32.386
GATES: Ryan, on my count.
One, two, three!

22:32.386 --> 22:34.546
- Stop!
- OK, I'm only gonna listen.

22:34.546 --> 22:36.306
Don't touch me!
Sats 91.

22:36.306 --> 22:38.506
Your oxygen level is low.
We need to evaluate your lungs.

22:38.506 --> 22:39.826
HE COUGHS
Leave me alone!

22:39.826 --> 22:41.626
Let me just cut your shirt, OK?

22:41.626 --> 22:42.466
Don't touch... don't touch my stuff!

22:42.466 --> 22:43.826
Sir, relax!

22:43.826 --> 22:45.466
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Sir, relax!

22:45.466 --> 22:47.146
Oh.
What the hell?

22:47.146 --> 22:48.706
Oh, my God. Now you did it.

22:48.706 --> 22:51.226
Is this cocaine?
You cut through the damn bag!

22:51.226 --> 22:52.186
Bag of what?

22:52.186 --> 22:54.906
You shouldn't have done that!
It's weaponised ricin.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.626
It's extremely lethal.
I made it myself.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.106
Ricin? I am so out of here.
You shouldn't have done that.

22:59.106 --> 23:01.746
Whoa, stop! You open those doors,
the whole ER is exposed.

23:01.746 --> 23:03.706
I told you not to touch me!
Now we're all dead!

23:03.706 --> 23:04.865
ER.

23:04.865 --> 23:08.465
Frank, call HazMat.
We have a situation here.

23:12.185 --> 23:16.145
Cops said he's a real whack job, had
stuff on anthrax, botulism, plague...

23:16.145 --> 23:19.025
All right, let's keep it down.
We don't want people to panic.

23:19.025 --> 23:21.825
We're moving people out of the area.
They'll know something's up.

23:21.825 --> 23:23.825
Environmental services won't touch
it. They said call HazMat.

23:23.825 --> 23:25.265
OK, did you?

23:25.265 --> 23:27.345
Yes, but the fire department
is supposed to respond first.

23:27.345 --> 23:28.385
What's their ETA?

23:28.385 --> 23:29.465
Ten minutes out.

23:29.465 --> 23:31.945
All right, I think
we should seal off Exam two.

23:31.945 --> 23:34.225
With what, duct tape? I'll find some.

23:34.225 --> 23:34.825
Morris!

23:34.825 --> 23:35.905
Right behind you!

23:37.065 --> 23:39.505
If they get sick, we need
access to that room.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.185
Be a few hours before
any symptoms manifest.

23:41.185 --> 23:42.865
We can't just leave them in there.

23:42.865 --> 23:45.905
They got to be quarantined till
we know what we're dealing with.

23:45.905 --> 23:47.985
Let's just concentrate
on evacuation now.

23:47.985 --> 23:49.025
Evacuation where?

23:49.025 --> 23:50.905
You know this hospital, you tell me.

23:50.905 --> 23:53.265
ANDREW: Hold the elevator.
Where are you going?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.865
Upstairs for observation.
I thought you had no beds.

23:56.865 --> 23:59.345
We can't leave them
here in hot zone, can we?

23:59.345 --> 24:01.145
Surgical lobby. Come with me.

24:01.145 --> 24:03.665
PHONE RINGS

24:03.665 --> 24:06.985
Dr Gates, the hazardous materials
team is on the way.

24:06.985 --> 24:10.385
I have an unstable patient, three
freaking interns - please hurry up.

24:10.385 --> 24:13.985
I knew the cops would be all over
my place, so I took my stuff and ran.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.425
There are no masks in here!
There's no gowns either!

24:16.425 --> 24:18.425
I didn't count on
the fire escape collapsing.

24:18.425 --> 24:20.505
DARIA: You know what, Felix? Shut up.

24:20.505 --> 24:22.665
Inhalation of aerosolised ricin
can kill in 24 hours.

24:22.665 --> 24:25.985
Does it say if it's absorbed though
the skin? We should wear gloves.

24:25.985 --> 24:28.305
How's his pulse ox?
They're trapping us in here!

24:30.225 --> 24:32.025
PHONE RINGS
Oh, my God.

24:32.025 --> 24:34.665
Annie, honey,
I'm with a patient - gotta go.

24:34.665 --> 24:38.545
All right, let's stay focused.
Secondary survey, let's go.

24:39.825 --> 24:42.104
I've got a year's
supply of valium in here.

24:42.104 --> 24:44.184
Don't forget the IV tubing
and the infusers.

24:44.184 --> 24:45.704
I don't know what they have upstairs.

24:45.704 --> 24:47.824
How much you think this
would be worth on the street?

24:47.824 --> 24:50.904
After today, I'm thinking
about an alternate career.

24:50.904 --> 24:52.064
You doing all right?

24:52.064 --> 24:54.464
I should bring some Fentanyl, too.

24:54.464 --> 24:56.584
He's got a phone in there.

24:56.584 --> 24:58.504
You can call and talk to him.

24:58.504 --> 25:00.944
Nah, he's busy.

25:00.944 --> 25:02.584
I'm busy, too.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.304
Gotta start my new career
as a drug dealer.

25:06.344 --> 25:07.744
I don't want that.

25:07.744 --> 25:09.944
I'm not too interested in
what you want at this point.

25:09.944 --> 25:11.864
I didn't mean for this to happen.

25:11.864 --> 25:14.384
You should have told us about this
before we started working on you.

25:14.384 --> 25:16.664
I tried! Listen, my leg
is really killing me.

25:16.664 --> 25:18.864
Yeah, it's broken
and unfortunately for you,

25:18.864 --> 25:20.704
we can't help, because
we're stuck in this room.

25:20.704 --> 25:22.424
Please, something's really wrong.

25:22.424 --> 25:24.144
DARIA: That doesn't look right.

25:24.144 --> 25:27.264
GATES: Yeah, compartment syndrome.
He needs a fasciotomy.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.424
You're bleeding from the fracture
into the soft tissue.

25:30.424 --> 25:33.224
That's why blood is not
getting to your foot.

25:33.224 --> 25:36.544
Ryan, get me some morphine.
Morphine for this guy?

25:36.544 --> 25:38.784
We treat everybody the same.
What's morphine look like?

25:38.784 --> 25:42.184
It's a clear bottle, black top,
says, "Morphine".

25:42.184 --> 25:44.944
It's really killing me!
I don't think there's any here.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.344
All right, I'm sorry,
this is gonna hurt, man.

25:47.344 --> 25:48.304
You...what's your name?
Daria.

25:48.304 --> 25:49.544
Talk to him.
What?

25:49.544 --> 25:50.664
Talk to the patient!

25:50.664 --> 25:53.144
Oh...OK. So, so how did
you become a bioterrorist?

25:53.144 --> 25:54.544
OW!
TRACY SHRIEKS

25:54.544 --> 25:55.704
Damn it!

25:55.704 --> 25:57.304
Ow!

25:57.304 --> 25:58.304
Hey!

25:59.504 --> 26:01.064
What's going on?

26:02.624 --> 26:04.304
HazMat team's about ten minutes out.

26:04.304 --> 26:06.064
In the meantime,
discharge whoever you can

26:06.064 --> 26:07.944
and bring the rest
to the evacuation area.

26:07.944 --> 26:10.344
You moved all the portable
monitors upstairs?

26:10.344 --> 26:12.464
Grab your instruments,
medicines, whatever you need,

26:12.464 --> 26:14.824
when Hazmat gets here,
they won't let you back in.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.464
- OK, let's move...
- Excuse me.

26:16.464 --> 26:18.783
Mr Burke, you can't leave yet.
What the hell is going on?

26:18.783 --> 26:20.983
First I heard bomb scare,
now they're saying anthrax.

26:20.983 --> 26:23.383
It's not anthrax.
Whatever it is, I don't need it.

26:23.383 --> 26:24.503
Stop for one minute, OK?

26:24.503 --> 26:27.943
You have a serious infection,
and you need to be admitted
for IV antibiotics.

26:27.943 --> 26:30.463
I can't be admitted.
I'm taking the GED tomorrow.

26:30.463 --> 26:31.383
I'm finally gonna get my diploma.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.223
BANFIELD: Sam, we're going up.

26:33.223 --> 26:36.823
Please, don't leave. I'm gonna try
to work something out for you, OK?

26:36.823 --> 26:39.703
OK, go slow. He needs an
expiratory phase.

26:39.703 --> 26:41.863
Any chance we could give oral
antibiotics to the cellulitis guy?

26:41.863 --> 26:43.103
No!

26:43.103 --> 26:45.503
- He's gonna go home, AMA.
- Change his mind.

26:45.503 --> 26:48.223
I said we were taking
the rule-out MI's to family practice.

26:48.223 --> 26:49.863
We don't have enough staff
to cover an additional area.

26:49.863 --> 26:52.623
I got the clinic nurses
to agree to help out!

26:52.623 --> 26:55.063
The rule-outs will wait
upstairs like everyone else!

26:55.063 --> 26:58.103
You just let me know when you
need my help, OK? I'm here for you.

27:04.263 --> 27:06.623
You think the docs in that room
are gonna be OK?

27:08.183 --> 27:10.023
I don't know.

27:10.023 --> 27:11.623
I hope so.

27:14.703 --> 27:17.903
I heard you worked
in Thailand after the tsunami.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.943
Indonesia.

27:19.943 --> 27:23.663
Well, this must seem
pretty minor compared to that.

27:25.983 --> 27:28.583
Yeah. It is.

27:30.543 --> 27:32.943
ICU says they're not allowed
to lend out their EKG machine.

27:32.943 --> 27:33.983
Don't ask, just take it!

27:33.983 --> 27:35.863
Intubated patients, through there.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.143
How many more
are left down there?

27:37.143 --> 27:38.423
Another 20 or 30.

27:38.423 --> 27:38.543
We need more space.

27:38.543 --> 27:40.823
Respiratory's on the way
with more O2 tanks,

27:40.823 --> 27:42.903
and rehab's sending
three vents they aren't using.

27:42.903 --> 27:44.663
Rehab was Marisol's idea.
PHONE RINGS

27:44.663 --> 27:46.303
- This one's a keeper.
- Sorry. Gotta take this.

27:46.303 --> 27:47.103
Hey!

27:47.103 --> 27:48.983
DUBENKO: Eleven hang-ups, Dusty?

27:48.983 --> 27:50.303
We are under siege!

27:50.303 --> 27:53.303
You do know your number
shows up, right? I can tell it's you.

27:53.303 --> 27:54.582
'I am stuck with a new intern,'

27:54.582 --> 27:57.062
and the ER was the target
of a bioterrorist attack.

27:57.062 --> 27:59.022
Mm-hmm.
I used to call that a Thursday.

27:59.022 --> 28:00.742
'Oh, you love this, don't you?'

28:00.742 --> 28:02.022
Me getting my ass kicked

28:02.022 --> 28:03.902
while you get to sleep in
and go to yoga.

28:03.902 --> 28:06.502
I wish that was the case,
but with all the lectures,

28:06.502 --> 28:09.222
conferences and interviews
out here, it's been gruelling.

28:09.222 --> 28:10.862
Speaking of which, I got to run.

28:10.862 --> 28:13.262
Yeah, no way. Lucien...Lucien!

28:13.262 --> 28:16.462
The ER's being attacked, and
you're catching up on phone calls.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.782
Any headway with Anspaugh?

28:17.782 --> 28:19.342
No. But he knows it's crap.

28:19.342 --> 28:20.782
He wouldn't even
look me in the eye.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.182
We got a transplant kid
who pulled out his g-tube.

28:22.182 --> 28:23.542
Oh, that's Neela's speciality.

28:23.542 --> 28:24.542
Oh, you owe me.

28:26.382 --> 28:28.502
The guys in the moon suits
are here.

28:28.502 --> 28:30.262
Oh, good, I feel
so much better now.

28:30.262 --> 28:32.542
They must have an exit strategy.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.942
Fracture must have severed
the tibeal artery.

28:34.942 --> 28:36.582
I can't see crap.

28:36.582 --> 28:39.022
RYAN: It says here
that low-micron ricin particles

28:39.022 --> 28:41.862
may be suspended in the air
for hours. We're screwed!

28:41.862 --> 28:43.182
Put the phone down
and get me a suture kit.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.782
I'll have to make this incision
bigger to find the bleeding vessel.

28:45.782 --> 28:48.022
You ready? Here we go.
One, two, three....

28:48.022 --> 28:49.142
Ow!

28:49.142 --> 28:51.902
All right, four by fours!
Give me four by fours!

28:51.902 --> 28:53.462
I don't feel so good.

28:53.462 --> 28:55.822
TRACY: You need to lie down.
What are you being admitted for?

28:55.822 --> 28:58.382
Asthma. It's really bad this time.

28:58.382 --> 29:01.582
We were here all night. Mom went home
for a shower. I can't get any air!

29:01.582 --> 29:03.302
It's gonna be OK, I promise.

29:03.302 --> 29:06.422
Daria, find a large BP cuff
and put it around his thigh.

29:06.422 --> 29:07.782
Heart rate's up to 135.

29:07.782 --> 29:10.022
Look in the drawer for
a haemostat.
Like a clamp?

29:10.022 --> 29:12.662
Yeah, a needle driver,
anything - come on!

29:12.662 --> 29:13.622
Do we have any albuterol
in here?

29:13.622 --> 29:14.902
It's too much!

29:14.902 --> 29:16.502
He's not moving air very well.

29:16.502 --> 29:18.622
Felix, talk to me -
who was the ricin for?

29:18.622 --> 29:20.742
- It doesn't matter.
- If we're all gonna die,

29:20.742 --> 29:23.262
you can at least tell us why.
You owe us that much.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.022
I was gonna send it to
a few officials, prove my point.

29:25.022 --> 29:26.222
Systolic's only 84.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.342
This cuff is way too small!

29:28.342 --> 29:29.981
And I'm not finding any clamps.
OK!

29:29.981 --> 29:31.821
I'm serious, this guy needs a neb.

29:31.821 --> 29:33.541
We don't normally keep
respiratory meds in here.

29:33.541 --> 29:35.941
Check the cart,
look through all the bottles.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.741
FELIX: Homeland security,
what a joke! We let anyone in.

29:38.741 --> 29:41.061
Anything can happen!
it's not right!

29:41.061 --> 29:43.781
Neither is exposing a bunch of
innocent people to a deadly biotoxin.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.341
She has a point there, Felix.

29:45.341 --> 29:47.781
FELIX: My wife, she used
to work near the Pentagon.

29:49.901 --> 29:52.621
She got killed
by one of the planes.

29:52.621 --> 29:54.381
FELIX SOBS

29:54.381 --> 29:56.541
All right, I need Prolene.
Get me Prolene.

29:56.541 --> 29:58.981
What's Prolene?

29:58.981 --> 30:00.101
HE SIGHS

30:00.341 --> 30:02.541
So this is a dose
of Vancomycin now.

30:02.541 --> 30:05.061
You're gonna go home
with this IV tonight.

30:05.061 --> 30:07.101
In the morning,
before your test,

30:07.101 --> 30:08.581
you'll come in,
show your bracelet.

30:08.581 --> 30:11.221
They're gonna bring you back and
give you a second dose. Deal?

30:11.221 --> 30:13.381
Deal. Thanks.

30:13.381 --> 30:15.421
It's cool you're getting
your GED, you know.

30:15.421 --> 30:17.581
I got tired of telling people
I dropped out of high school.

30:17.581 --> 30:19.941
You're challenging yourself.
I admire that.

30:19.941 --> 30:21.701
MORRIS: This is Devon,
eight years old.

30:21.701 --> 30:25.221
Floor collapse, fell into a basement.
Crush injuries to chest and pelvis.

30:25.221 --> 30:28.341
His mom jumped down to get to her
kid. Arm looks broken, vitals OK.

30:28.341 --> 30:29.621
OK, this way.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.621
- Mommy?
- Devon, honey, I'm right here.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.781
- Where are you?
- Get me off of this thing!

30:33.781 --> 30:35.981
- In a minute, ma'am.
- I need to see my son!

30:37.101 --> 30:42.541
What's going on?
We're closed to trauma.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.741
I didn't...
MORRIS: I did.

30:43.741 --> 30:46.181
Diverting an unstable kid
across town would have been crazy.

30:46.181 --> 30:47.581
I authorised them to come.

30:47.581 --> 30:50.061
KAYA: Sats only 82.
TAGGART: Come on, wake up.

30:50.061 --> 30:51.501
Morris, throw me that bag.
This kid's not breathing.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.181
KAYA: Devon?

30:53.181 --> 30:55.261
All right, I think I got it.

30:55.261 --> 30:56.541
There we go.

30:57.901 --> 30:59.741
God... Crap!
Another Prolene?

30:59.741 --> 31:02.301
- His sats only 81.
- All right, turn up the O2.

31:02.301 --> 31:04.661
- It's up, it's all the way up.
- Felix? Felix!

31:04.661 --> 31:08.700
I can't...under the...
She went out of snow...

31:08.700 --> 31:11.220
Dr Gates, he's altered,
and there's no albuterol in here.

31:11.220 --> 31:12.860
All right, mac three and a seven-0.

31:12.860 --> 31:15.260
Jacob, hang in there,
I'm gonna be right back.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.260
What's a mac?

31:16.260 --> 31:18.860
Macintosh laryngoscope, size three,

31:18.860 --> 31:20.580
seven-O ET tube.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.340
Got it. We're going to intubate?

31:22.340 --> 31:23.180
Yeah, looks like we might have to.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.140
V-tach, I can't feel a pulse.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.460
All right, start CPR.
I can't take my hand out of here.

31:28.460 --> 31:31.620
Come on, let's go!
Ryan, start compressions.

31:31.620 --> 31:34.980
Daria, bag him. Tracy, charge
the defibrillator, let's go.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.860
This is the real thing now.

31:36.860 --> 31:37.980
360?

31:37.980 --> 31:41.180
Yeah. Put the paddles on his chest.

31:41.180 --> 31:42.940
Come on, put the paddles
on the chest!

31:42.940 --> 31:44.340
Clear.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.860
Go!

31:48.420 --> 31:50.020
Still v-tach.

31:50.020 --> 31:52.780
All right, resume compressions.
Daria, switch with me.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.700
Put pressure on the artery
like your life depends upon it.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.460
Tracy, give me that tube.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.180
It's for Jacob -
there was only one.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.540
This guy's not breathing,
Jacob is - let's go.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.660
- He's just a kid...
- Shock him again.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.340
- Clear.
- All right.

32:06.340 --> 32:08.620
Wait, so you're gonna
let some innocent kid

32:08.620 --> 32:11.620
suffer and maybe even die to save
a lowlife who tried to kill us?

32:11.620 --> 32:12.700
RYAN: Still v-tach.

32:12.700 --> 32:15.500
I'm sorry, but why do you
even want to save this guy?

32:15.500 --> 32:19.020
Because we prioritise the sickest
patient. That's what we do here.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.460
If you guys don't get it,
you don't belong.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.700
Fine...then you tell
that to the kid's mom.

33:12.819 --> 33:13.779
(over radio) He's in.

33:13.899 --> 33:15.219
We can trust him
to take care of this.

33:15.299 --> 33:16.499
So what's this all about?

33:16.579 --> 33:17.419
An aircraft?

33:17.539 --> 33:19.619
It's not an aircraft
we're talking about.

33:19.699 --> 33:21.179
The Insignia Project.

33:21.259 --> 33:23.179
What are they doing down there?

33:30.179 --> 33:31.499
It's not like
other cars.

33:32.179 --> 33:33.739
It's as if it can see.

33:33.819 --> 33:35.299
It reads road signs?

33:35.419 --> 33:36.339
How's that
possible?

33:36.459 --> 33:38.099
I don't know what kind
of technology they're using.

33:38.659 --> 33:39.499
It can adapt

33:39.579 --> 33:40.939
to impossible conditions.

33:44.379 --> 33:45.459
What else
can it do?

33:52.579 --> 33:54.699
Brian, it's Sue on 3rd...

33:55.219 --> 33:58.219
..yup, going to have to reschedule
Tuesday...

34:00.219 --> 34:01.219
..I bet you would.

34:01.659 --> 34:07.459
Tony, but I'm at work now so I can't
talk can I?...Not much.

34:08.339 --> 34:09.619
I know how you like your muffins....

34:10.938 --> 34:14.259
Well, if you ask me Stephanie, she
needs to go on a diet!

34:17.378 --> 34:18.578
Sudafed Congestion & Headache...

34:18.858 --> 34:22.777
..deals with the cause of congestion
and also relieves your headache.

34:23.058 --> 34:24.697
Rebecca!

34:24.858 --> 34:27.138
I have to tell you,
that looks absolutely exhausting!

34:27.297 --> 34:29.858
Is it disappointing to you
that you do this strenuous stuff

34:30.018 --> 34:31.898
and yet your cholesterol
is still raised?

34:32.018 --> 34:33.297
Well, yes. Yes, it is.

34:33.458 --> 34:35.058
As you know,
I was quite taken aback.

34:35.217 --> 34:37.658
So in total, then, what differences
have you made every day?

34:37.818 --> 34:40.138
I've introduced
the pro.activ drinks.

34:40.297 --> 34:41.978
So I have one of those
with a meal every day.

34:42.138 --> 34:43.858
I'm having
my three portions a day.

34:43.978 --> 34:45.578
My yoghurt in the morning,

34:45.697 --> 34:47.338
milk in my tea all day long,

34:47.498 --> 34:50.658
and I'll have the spread
on baked potato or toast.

34:50.818 --> 34:52.418
It's just part of the day,
part of my life.

34:52.578 --> 34:56.178
You too can reduce your cholesterol
level with Flora pro.activ.

34:56.338 --> 34:58.898
But have our volunteers
managed to reduce theirs?

34:59.018 --> 35:01.218
Join us next week and find out.

35:26.378 --> 35:27.338
CROAKING

BARKING

35:48.498 --> 35:49.738
HOWL

35:54.137 --> 35:56.137
A more connected world

35:56.257 --> 35:57.937
is a better world.

35:58.057 --> 35:59.777
We're better, connected.

36:32.737 --> 36:34.377
Goo, goo.

36:34.457 --> 36:36.657
# Goo, goo, goo, g-g-goo-oo!

36:36.737 --> 36:37.697
Goo.

36:38.537 --> 36:40.777
Goo! Goo! Goo!

36:40.857 --> 36:41.417
Goo...

37:12.697 --> 37:13.897
GATES: All right, I'm in.

37:15.017 --> 37:17.017
Tape.
Got it.

37:17.017 --> 37:20.297
Two milligrams, right?
Yeah, give it to
Daria and, er...

37:20.297 --> 37:22.977
Always hold the tube
against the soft palate

37:22.977 --> 37:25.017
until it's secured in.
Going again.

37:25.017 --> 37:26.577
Clear.

37:28.177 --> 37:29.857
- Still v-tach. Resuming.
- All right.

37:29.857 --> 37:32.056
- What do I do with this?
- Squirt it in the tube.

37:32.056 --> 37:33.256
Good.

37:33.256 --> 37:34.736
Here you go.

37:34.736 --> 37:36.816
That one's for Jacob.
Two cc's in the IV.

37:36.816 --> 37:39.416
Won't intravenous epi
mess with his rhythm?

37:39.416 --> 37:43.136
Maybe, but it'll dilate his
bronchioles and help him oxygenate.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.216
All right, do it,
Tracy, with a flush.

37:45.216 --> 37:46.376
Here goes.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.056
- No change.
- All right, shock him again.

37:51.056 --> 37:52.856
Might work now
with the drugs on board.

37:54.896 --> 37:55.856
Clear.

37:57.096 --> 37:58.736
MACHINES BEEP

37:58.736 --> 38:00.976
Back in sinus.

38:00.976 --> 38:02.176
All right.

38:02.176 --> 38:03.416
Aren't we the heroes(!)

38:03.416 --> 38:05.456
Come on, we just saved a guy's life.

38:05.456 --> 38:09.016
Dr Gates, it worked.
Jacob's sats are coming up.

38:09.016 --> 38:10.616
Good.
PHONE RINGS

38:10.616 --> 38:12.296
Hello?
'It's Cate Banfield.'

38:12.296 --> 38:13.616
How you guys doing?

38:13.616 --> 38:16.856
Oh, honestly,
we're a little bored in here.

38:16.856 --> 38:19.736
When you open the doors, you'll
be in a quarantine corridor.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.856
What the hell?

38:33.816 --> 38:35.656
This is so surreal.

38:35.656 --> 38:38.776
BANFIELD: Gates, what have you got?
Severed tibeal artery.

38:38.776 --> 38:41.136
I got vascular standing by.

38:41.136 --> 38:44.256
Status asthmaticus.
He needs a terb drip in the ICU.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.776
I'll make sure they have room.

38:45.776 --> 38:48.816
The four of us - dry martinis,
straight up, with a twist.

38:48.816 --> 38:52.216
You'll all be decontaminated
and admitted for observation.

38:52.216 --> 38:54.496
I hope they can
decontaminate our insides,

38:54.496 --> 38:57.176
because we've been breathing
that crap for a long time.

39:00.376 --> 39:01.736
Ow.

39:01.736 --> 39:03.416
Positive Murphy sign - any fever?

39:03.416 --> 39:04.856
Uh, yep - white count's 24.

39:04.856 --> 39:07.135
Ultrasound showed
acalculous cholecystitis.

39:07.135 --> 39:10.415
It looks like you need an operation
to take out your gallbladder.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.375
Will I have to stay home
from school?

39:12.375 --> 39:15.095
Only for a few days.
We'll do it laparoscopically.

39:15.095 --> 39:17.415
Which means we'll only
be making a tiny cut.

39:17.415 --> 39:20.375
If you make a bigger cut,
could I stay home longer?

39:20.375 --> 39:21.415
Don't like school, huh?

39:21.415 --> 39:24.895
I just moved here, and
everyone already knows each other.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.255
Did you write a pre-op note?

39:26.255 --> 39:27.415
Uh, not yet.

39:27.415 --> 39:29.975
It's hard, I know.
I just moved here, too.

39:29.975 --> 39:32.975
The girls in my new school,
well, they're all into being cool

39:32.975 --> 39:36.175
and making out. I miss Detroit.

39:38.175 --> 39:41.415
Listen, you don't want
to be cool in seventh grade.

39:41.415 --> 39:42.895
I don't?
No way.

39:42.895 --> 39:44.775
Seventh grade cool kids
peak at 16

39:44.775 --> 39:47.255
and spend the rest of their
lives missing the glory days.

39:47.255 --> 39:49.855
Me and Dr Rasgotra here?
Huge nerds at your age.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.095
- Am I right?
- For sure.

39:52.095 --> 39:53.495
PAGER BEEPS

39:53.495 --> 39:55.935
We've got a trauma -
they're asking for you.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.935
Make sure you get
consent from Mom.

39:57.935 --> 40:00.815
You know, the truth is,

40:00.815 --> 40:03.855
every cool adult will tell you
they were an unpopular kid.

40:03.855 --> 40:05.295
You're just saying that.

40:05.295 --> 40:08.015
No, it's like, um...
a rule of the universe.

40:08.015 --> 40:09.135
You'll see.

40:09.135 --> 40:10.415
I will?

40:10.415 --> 40:13.775
Yeah. The adventure
is just beginning.

40:15.215 --> 40:17.935
Somebody grab me another cordis,
this wire is kinked.

40:17.935 --> 40:19.695
Fluid in Morrison's -
he needs a repeat haemocue.

40:19.695 --> 40:20.655
I'm on it.

40:23.935 --> 40:26.295
Hey, hang in there,
I know it's hard to watch.

40:26.295 --> 40:27.695
This is all my fault.

40:27.695 --> 40:30.375
I took him with me on the job.

40:30.375 --> 40:33.295
I don't have anyone to watch him,
stay with him after school.

40:33.295 --> 40:35.095
Believe me, I get that.

40:35.095 --> 40:38.015
I'm a locksmith and the banks
have us running ragged,

40:38.015 --> 40:39.975
changing locks
on foreclosed houses.

40:41.095 --> 40:41.775
Sounds depressing.

40:41.775 --> 40:46.094
Who knows why some people's lives
work out and others' don't?

40:46.094 --> 40:47.814
It all seems so random.

40:48.894 --> 40:50.414
Yeah.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.134
OK, subclavian's in.

40:52.134 --> 40:54.734
Get the blood bank
to rush our packed cells.

40:54.734 --> 40:57.454
HANNAH: Devon thought that
he saw a cat in the house,

40:57.454 --> 40:59.374
and he went inside to see and...

40:59.374 --> 41:03.814
The next thing I know,
he was screaming through a hole
in the floor.

41:03.814 --> 41:05.654
Your tube's in
the right mainstem.

41:05.654 --> 41:07.534
MORRIS: I know.
So why don't you pull it back?

41:07.534 --> 41:10.294
I put it there intentionally
to decrease the risk of pneumo.

41:10.294 --> 41:12.014
Then you should decrease
tidal volume.

41:12.014 --> 41:15.854
You know what? You really need
to stop micro-managing everyone.

41:15.854 --> 41:18.054
Do your job,
and I won't have to.

41:18.054 --> 41:20.614
Have this out later.
We need to get him to surgery now.

41:20.614 --> 41:22.334
I'll get ortho in here
to reduce that arm.

41:22.334 --> 41:23.534
OR's ready.

41:23.534 --> 41:25.894
OK, let's go -
I'll update you as soon as I can.

41:25.894 --> 41:27.854
No, no,
give her a moment with her son.

41:27.854 --> 41:29.894
You know, we don't
have time for this.

41:29.894 --> 41:32.654
Two minutes?

41:44.414 --> 41:45.894
Listen, baby boy.

41:47.334 --> 41:50.854
I want you to be strong
in there, OK?

41:50.854 --> 41:55.614
Because...if anything
happened to you...

41:56.934 --> 41:58.254
..the world would stop.

42:02.094 --> 42:04.894
You know that, right?

42:11.614 --> 42:13.294
Felix made it to the OR.

42:13.294 --> 42:16.254
RYAN: Baby, they do it every year -
it's tradition.

42:16.254 --> 42:16.734
What about Jacob?

42:16.734 --> 42:18.534
He's tucked away in the picu.

42:18.534 --> 42:22.053
They keep us overnight the first
day - it's a ritual. Should be fun.

42:23.213 --> 42:25.333
I love you, too.
Kiss the kids good night.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.373
Bye.

42:26.373 --> 42:28.813
Why are you lying to your wife?

42:28.813 --> 42:31.293
- She'd freak if she knew the truth.
- Give her a little credit.

42:31.293 --> 42:33.533
- Yeah, got it.
- Thanks.

42:33.533 --> 42:34.933
HE SIGHS

42:34.933 --> 42:37.053
RYAN: Annie grew up in west Texas

42:37.053 --> 42:40.133
in a town with, like, 4,000 people.

42:40.133 --> 42:42.573
Never meant to end up
with a guy from Brooklyn,

42:42.573 --> 42:45.013
and she was totally against
moving to the city,

42:45.013 --> 42:46.333
but I fought for it.

42:46.333 --> 42:49.733
Can't really practise emergency
medicine out in the sticks, huh?

42:49.733 --> 42:51.813
Exactly. I talked her into this.

42:51.813 --> 42:52.933
Ooh, boy.

42:52.933 --> 42:55.893
She was nervous about smog,
traffic, purse snatchers...

42:55.893 --> 43:00.173
So, I can't quite bring myself
to tell her that, on my first day,

43:00.173 --> 43:02.693
I was the target of a weapon
of mass destruction.

43:02.693 --> 43:04.173
Hey, you.
Hi.

43:04.173 --> 43:06.253
You OK?
Yeah.

43:06.253 --> 43:09.453
I'm not coughing up blood,
but the night is still young.

43:09.453 --> 43:13.653
Yeah, there's only eight more hours
till we find out if we're gonna die.

43:13.653 --> 43:17.453
OK, well, they're looking for
beds for you guys upstairs.

43:17.453 --> 43:19.093
Uh...can I get you some lunch?

43:19.093 --> 43:21.013
Burgers, fries, onion rings,
all on me.

43:21.013 --> 43:24.813
I mean, after all, it could
be our last day on this earth.

43:27.093 --> 43:29.173
What's up, Ryan,
you a vegetarian?

43:30.653 --> 43:32.413
Ryan!
Whoa!

43:32.413 --> 43:34.813
Hey, we need a gurney here!

43:34.813 --> 43:36.293
Keloid cowboy can go home.

43:36.293 --> 43:38.013
He has a follow-up
in surgery clinic.

43:38.013 --> 43:40.453
Cholecystitis girl will have
to hang here till a bed opens up.

43:40.453 --> 43:43.373
She won't mind.
She's crushing on Dr Andrew here.

43:43.373 --> 43:44.573
Too bad I only have eyes for you.

43:44.573 --> 43:48.013
That little boy's going to the OR,
I'm pretty sure it's a liver lac.

43:48.013 --> 43:50.493
Tell them to start prepping.
I'll be right there.

43:53.693 --> 43:55.173
You want to grab a coffee?

43:55.173 --> 43:57.412
You know, after this settles down?

43:57.412 --> 44:00.652
Or maybe a stiff drink's
more in order. It's been quite a day.

44:00.652 --> 44:01.452
Yeah, it has.

44:01.452 --> 44:04.292
I just thought we could
talk about what happened.

44:04.292 --> 44:06.772
Don't mind her,
she's in a foul mood.

44:06.772 --> 44:09.372
Today's her day off.
She struck out with Anspaugh,

44:09.372 --> 44:10.892
and got sucked into this mess.

44:10.892 --> 44:12.292
Struck out with Anspaugh?

44:12.292 --> 44:14.772
Yeah, she's on a campaign
to bring Lucien back.

44:14.772 --> 44:16.212
I told her it was a lost cause.

44:16.212 --> 44:18.412
But Neela's stubborn.
Your uncle's worse.
Yeah.

44:18.412 --> 44:20.172
Marisol, you work on
the surgical floor...

44:20.172 --> 44:23.252
The elective surgery guys
were asking how they could help,

44:23.252 --> 44:27.052
I suggested they take the obstructive
pancreatitis case off your plate.

44:27.052 --> 44:27.492
Unless you wanted to
do that one yourself.

44:27.492 --> 44:30.852
Are you for real?

44:30.852 --> 44:32.572
We have blood pressure yet?

44:32.572 --> 44:35.172
BP at 85/51 -
it's too low to get access.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.332
Is he satting OK?

44:36.332 --> 44:38.292
- Go back to the tent.
- Is it the ricin?

44:38.292 --> 44:39.892
Go back inside,
you haven't been cleared yet.

44:39.892 --> 44:40.652
Is this what happens?

44:40.652 --> 44:44.212
Let's let Dr Banfield
fix him up - come on.

44:44.212 --> 44:45.132
You think it's the ricin?

44:45.132 --> 44:47.412
It seems early, but it's possible.

44:47.412 --> 44:50.572
Brachial artery's here.
Slightly medial, you'll hit the vein.

44:50.572 --> 44:51.732
Got a flash.

44:51.732 --> 44:52.812
HE GROANS

44:52.812 --> 44:53.892
Welcome back.

44:53.892 --> 44:56.692
REIDY: Drug overdose in PEA.
Found him two blocks away

44:56.692 --> 44:58.492
with a syringe still
connected to an IV

44:58.492 --> 44:59.812
We're closed to trauma.

44:59.812 --> 45:02.492
He's wearing a County ID
bracelet, registered for today.

45:02.492 --> 45:04.492
Must have wandered off
for a drug fix.

45:04.492 --> 45:06.172
It's my cellulitis guy.

45:06.172 --> 45:08.852
BANFIELD: All right, move him
upstairs, let's go.

46:20.851 --> 46:21.811
(over radio) He's in.

46:21.931 --> 46:23.251
We can trust him
to take care of this.

46:23.331 --> 46:24.531
So what's this all about?

46:24.611 --> 46:25.451
An aircraft?

46:25.571 --> 46:27.651
It's not an aircraft
we're talking about.

46:27.731 --> 46:29.211
The Insignia Project.

46:29.291 --> 46:31.211
What are they doing down there?

46:38.211 --> 46:39.531
It's not like
other cars.

46:40.211 --> 46:41.771
It's as if it can see.

46:41.851 --> 46:43.331
It reads road signs?

46:43.451 --> 46:44.371
How's that
possible?

46:44.491 --> 46:46.131
I don't know what kind
of technology they're using.

46:46.691 --> 46:47.531
It can adapt

46:47.611 --> 46:48.971
to impossible conditions.

46:52.411 --> 46:53.491
What else
can it do?

47:10.890 --> 47:12.610
MORRIS: Resuming compressions.

47:12.610 --> 47:13.610
Narcan's in.

47:15.730 --> 47:17.250
It's the fourth dose.

47:17.250 --> 47:18.850
Are we sure it's opiates?

47:18.850 --> 47:22.930
Some guy told the paramedics they
shot heroin together an hour ago.

47:22.930 --> 47:25.090
He has track marks
all over his ankles.

47:25.090 --> 47:27.970
It's called a head-to-toe exam
for a reason.

47:30.290 --> 47:31.970
Hold compressions.

47:35.530 --> 47:36.690
Still PEA.

47:36.690 --> 47:38.010
Another epi.

47:38.010 --> 47:41.090
He was taking his high school
equivalency test tomorrow.

47:41.090 --> 47:44.130
He was not the type of guy who
was gonna walk out and shoot up.

47:44.130 --> 47:46.210
Did you ask about IV drug use
before you sent him out

47:46.210 --> 47:48.170
with a portal into a mainline vessel?

47:48.170 --> 47:49.450
Not specifically, no.

47:49.450 --> 47:53.090
You cannot judge people based on how
they look or what they're reading.

47:53.090 --> 47:56.290
I expect you to know that.

47:58.370 --> 47:59.850
Just heard from the CDC.

47:59.850 --> 48:02.570
The ricin powder was
too coarse to vaporise.

48:02.570 --> 48:04.890
No chance a toxic dose
could have got into the lungs.

48:04.890 --> 48:07.450
Oh! That's good news, Frank.

48:07.450 --> 48:10.890
FRANK: Exam two needs to stay sealed
pending environmental detail.

48:10.890 --> 48:13.770
That's just a precaution.
Otherwise, we're all clear.

48:13.770 --> 48:16.050
BANFIELD: Thanks, Frank.
Hold compressions.

48:16.050 --> 48:16.970
No change.

48:19.450 --> 48:20.690
That's it, we're done.

48:20.690 --> 48:21.570
What?

48:21.570 --> 48:25.210
Four rounds of cardiac meds, and
still he's in an agonal rhythm.

48:25.210 --> 48:26.570
Core temp's dropping.

48:26.570 --> 48:27.930
This guy's dead.

48:38.650 --> 48:40.170
CRENSHAW: What's our EBL?

48:40.170 --> 48:41.970
- 400 cc's.
- Not bad.

48:41.970 --> 48:43.050
Sponge.

48:43.050 --> 48:44.689
How's it going?

48:44.689 --> 48:47.169
Liver lac, grade three,
just like you thought.

48:47.169 --> 48:49.729
Repair's going well,
vitals are solid.

48:49.729 --> 48:51.689
I think Andrew here's
a good luck charm.

48:51.689 --> 48:53.689
Irrigate right here.

48:53.689 --> 48:56.089
I'll let the ER know.
Is it cool if I go then?

48:56.089 --> 48:59.329
Yeah. Check out the sit-in outside
Anspaugh's office on your way out.

48:59.329 --> 49:00.049
RASGOTRA: What?

49:00.049 --> 49:02.009
Brenner organised
some kind of protest.

49:02.009 --> 49:03.969
Everyone's talking about it.

49:11.969 --> 49:15.609
MAN: ..the humanity of this
department, Dr Dubenko has been...

49:15.609 --> 49:16.369
What's going on?

49:16.369 --> 49:18.009
We want Dubenko back.

49:18.009 --> 49:21.729
Dr Brenner says his uncle responds
to the strength in numbers concept.

49:21.729 --> 49:22.889
Sit down, join us.

49:22.889 --> 49:26.449
Uh...no, I've, er...
got some loose ends downstairs.

49:29.009 --> 49:30.489
When can I see Devon?

49:30.489 --> 49:33.209
As soon as he's in recovery,
they'll let us know.

49:33.209 --> 49:36.089
While you were asleep,
the police came by.

49:36.089 --> 49:37.929
They investigated the house.

49:37.929 --> 49:41.409
It seems the prior owner
intentionally broke a water pipe,

49:41.409 --> 49:43.169
flooded the whole first floor.

49:43.169 --> 49:46.289
Kind of a screw-you to the bank.
We see that kind of thing.

49:46.289 --> 49:50.049
With the heat and humidity, the
floorboards rotted and just gave way.

49:50.049 --> 49:52.889
Doesn't change the fact that
I've been dragging my son

49:52.889 --> 49:55.529
all over the Southside
changing locks.

49:56.809 --> 49:58.729
He's only eight years old.

49:58.729 --> 50:01.809
He deserves to be protected
from the world.

50:04.529 --> 50:07.889
You know, this idea that
we can protect our children -

50:07.889 --> 50:11.209
you believe it
because you have to -

50:11.209 --> 50:13.129
but it's an illusion.

50:14.849 --> 50:17.609
So, what, it's all just luck?

50:17.609 --> 50:20.609
All you can do is
hope for the best?

50:20.609 --> 50:22.448
You love him,

50:22.448 --> 50:24.448
you spend time with him.

50:24.448 --> 50:26.408
That's all any kid wants.

50:33.088 --> 50:36.608
One second, she's a raging bitch, and
the next, she's Mother Teresa?

50:36.608 --> 50:37.848
I don't get it.

50:37.848 --> 50:40.088
Well, she's pretty good
at faking compassion.

50:40.088 --> 50:41.848
Hey, I know you know this,

50:41.848 --> 50:44.408
but what she said about
the OD - that was crap.

50:44.408 --> 50:45.728
It wasn't your fault.

50:45.728 --> 50:49.288
Thanks, Archie.

50:50.608 --> 50:51.928
FRANK: Hello?

50:55.168 --> 50:56.448
Hello?

50:56.448 --> 50:59.008
They disconnected every damn phone.

50:59.008 --> 51:00.608
Pain assessment forms?

51:00.608 --> 51:02.328
File them next to
the H and P sheets.

51:04.288 --> 51:05.408
These are all filled out.

51:05.408 --> 51:06.728
I'll take those.

51:06.728 --> 51:11.568
And this looks like an old handout
on renal failure by Greg Pratt.

51:11.568 --> 51:12.568
Should I toss it?
it's from 2002...

51:12.568 --> 51:14.368
No, you should not toss that.

51:14.368 --> 51:16.328
That's his work. That's his legacy.

51:16.328 --> 51:17.368
Dr Morris?
Sorry.

51:17.368 --> 51:18.048
Do you mind if
I give you some feedback?

51:18.048 --> 51:19.288
Oh, here we go.

51:19.288 --> 51:21.608
You need to get better
control of your emotions.

51:21.608 --> 51:23.208
Act like a leader.
Oh, come on!

51:23.208 --> 51:25.488
All the, all the criticism,
the bullying.

51:25.488 --> 51:27.648
You think that's how you
get people to respect you?

51:27.648 --> 51:30.248
You have been storming
around sulking all day.

51:30.248 --> 51:32.768
You are an attending physician,
not a toddler.

51:41.568 --> 51:44.248
Did you think that I was finished?

51:44.248 --> 51:46.568
You know what, lady? Shut up!

51:48.208 --> 51:52.808
We have been through hell
here the last few weeks,

51:52.808 --> 51:55.608
but somehow we're
getting through it,

51:55.608 --> 51:56.807
and you know how?

51:56.807 --> 51:58.847
By showing up here

51:58.847 --> 52:01.727
every day and dedicating
ourselves to this work.

52:01.727 --> 52:03.967
You don't know us.

52:03.967 --> 52:06.207
You don't know this place.

52:06.207 --> 52:08.047
And the last thing we need

52:08.047 --> 52:10.127
is for some stranger
to come in here

52:10.127 --> 52:12.087
and tell us how it's done.

52:17.687 --> 52:20.607
I know that you lost a friend,

52:20.607 --> 52:24.647
and I'm sorry about that.

52:24.647 --> 52:27.567
But we will never have
a conversation like this again.

52:28.847 --> 52:30.887
Understand?

52:53.447 --> 52:54.647
Hey.

52:54.647 --> 52:56.047
Hey.

52:56.047 --> 52:57.327
Can I talk to you?

52:57.327 --> 52:59.247
Yeah, I'm all ears.

52:59.247 --> 53:01.487
Uh...thank you for what you did.

53:01.487 --> 53:03.767
I mean, the thing for Lucien.

53:03.767 --> 53:07.207
Um...I don't know if it will work,
but I appreciate it, I really do.

53:07.207 --> 53:08.847
No big deal.

53:08.847 --> 53:13.687
And...um....now, maybe
I'm being presumptuous here,

53:13.687 --> 53:17.407
but, um...if this was in any way
some kind of gesture intended for,

53:17.407 --> 53:21.607
well...me...I guess
I just want to be clear.

53:21.607 --> 53:23.967
Clear?

53:23.967 --> 53:27.447
We're work colleagues,
and that's all.

53:27.447 --> 53:30.407
I don't want to go for coffee
or drinks with you.

53:30.407 --> 53:32.327
Not now, not ever, OK?

53:35.326 --> 53:38.606
So, let me get this straight,
me going to bat for Lucien is,

53:38.606 --> 53:42.126
actually, some sort of er...
romantic overture to impress you?

53:43.886 --> 53:45.486
You've lost me there.

53:45.486 --> 53:47.686
But, um...
don't worry about the drinks.

53:47.686 --> 53:49.646
It's, er...message received.

53:51.846 --> 53:55.126
KAYA: Dr Brenner, your favourite
water skier's asking for you.

53:55.126 --> 53:56.926
Thank you.

54:00.966 --> 54:03.806
I've got the old records
on your thalassemia guy.

54:03.806 --> 54:05.126
Thank you.

54:05.126 --> 54:07.806
I called the pneumonia kid's
insurance company,

54:07.806 --> 54:09.646
told them to go to hell,
we're not transferring.

54:09.646 --> 54:10.806
Perfect.

54:10.806 --> 54:14.926
Uh, listen...I know things
have been a bit rough

54:14.926 --> 54:16.646
with you and Dr Morris today -

54:16.646 --> 54:19.726
I hope you don't mind my saying,
he's not himself.

54:19.726 --> 54:23.006
He took Dr Pratt's death
harder than any of us.

54:23.006 --> 54:25.766
But he's a good guy,
he's a good doctor and I...

54:25.766 --> 54:27.926
I don't have a problem
with Dr Morris.

54:27.926 --> 54:29.046
You don't?

54:29.046 --> 54:33.206
Nope. He cares about his patients,
has an opinion, takes a stand.

54:33.206 --> 54:36.406
Works his ass off, which is more
than I can say about you.

54:36.406 --> 54:37.566
Excuse me?

54:37.566 --> 54:41.886
You better get things in order,
Frank. It's a mess around here.

54:45.406 --> 54:48.006
I can't believe they made me
throw away my shoes.

54:48.006 --> 54:50.366
Louboutins - do you know
how much those cost?

54:50.366 --> 54:52.526
No, but I'm sure you're
going to tell us.

54:52.526 --> 54:54.486
That was quite
the first day, huh?

54:54.486 --> 54:56.006
TRACY: You could say that.

54:56.006 --> 54:58.446
I got to perform a liver lac
on an eight-year-old boy.

54:58.446 --> 54:59.926
That is so cool.

54:59.926 --> 55:01.526
So, they're not admitting you?

55:01.526 --> 55:04.046
No. You all heard the ricin
isn't dangerous, right?

55:04.046 --> 55:06.326
So, then what happened?
I mean, why'd you faint?

55:06.326 --> 55:10.565
I was reading about psychosomatic
responses to perceived toxic threats.

55:10.565 --> 55:12.325
Apparently, it's pretty common.

55:12.325 --> 55:14.885
Oh, so you're a hypochondriac.

55:14.885 --> 55:17.565
I said psychosomatic.
It's different.

55:17.565 --> 55:20.605
GATES: Either way, you'll live
to see another day of scut.

55:20.605 --> 55:22.925
Welcome to internship.
The dream starts now.

55:22.925 --> 55:24.765
Cheers.

55:24.765 --> 55:25.845
Hey.

55:25.965 --> 55:26.765
Hey.

55:26.765 --> 55:29.725
Health department said
you're cool to go. You're free.

55:29.725 --> 55:31.245
Oh! Sweet.

55:31.245 --> 55:32.245
Later.

55:32.245 --> 55:33.485
See you, kids.

55:33.485 --> 55:35.165
Bye.
Bye.

55:39.725 --> 55:40.485
Cute couple.

55:40.485 --> 55:41.565
Yup.

55:43.005 --> 55:44.365
So, when are you
going to class?

55:44.365 --> 55:46.045
Oh, forget it. It was a bad idea.

55:46.045 --> 55:47.205
What? why?

55:47.205 --> 55:49.925
Cos I'm missing things at work,
I'm barely there for Alex.

55:49.925 --> 55:52.005
The last thing I need
is to complicate my life.

55:52.005 --> 55:53.605
I don't know what happened today,

55:53.605 --> 55:56.005
but you're a kick-ass nurse,
and a good mother,

55:56.005 --> 55:59.445
and this is important to you,
and this is something you should do.

55:59.445 --> 56:00.685
You'll be great at it.

56:00.685 --> 56:01.765
Really?
Yes.

56:01.765 --> 56:04.245
Besides, I want to spend time
with Sarah and Alex anyway.

56:04.245 --> 56:06.325
All right.

56:06.325 --> 56:08.325
I mean, I guess I can make it,
if I really hurry.

56:08.325 --> 56:09.685
Course you can. Go.

56:09.685 --> 56:11.365
I'm just going to get some beer,

56:11.365 --> 56:13.085
we're gonna play some quarters,

56:13.085 --> 56:15.245
spark up the bong.

56:15.245 --> 56:17.925
Hey, I'm glad
you didn't die today.

56:22.125 --> 56:24.845
RASGOTRA: The whole
department was there.

56:24.845 --> 56:27.565
Doctors, nurses, techs, clerks.

56:27.565 --> 56:31.325
They were all sat outside Anspaugh's
office, demanding your return.

56:31.325 --> 56:33.805
You know, can we talk about
this later? I'm about to go out.

56:33.805 --> 56:35.525
What's there to talk about?

56:35.525 --> 56:37.565
Neela, these things
usually happen for a reason.

56:37.565 --> 56:40.245
Maybe it really is
time to move on.

56:40.245 --> 56:41.445
Time for a new chapter.

56:41.445 --> 56:42.605
You belong at County.

56:42.605 --> 56:44.045
You know it, and I know it.

56:44.045 --> 56:45.244
Don't make me beg.

56:45.244 --> 56:47.684
It's healthy
to change things up, you know?

56:47.684 --> 56:49.084
I was stagnating there.

56:49.084 --> 56:50.084
'Oh, that's bollocks.'

56:50.084 --> 56:51.204
DOORBELL RINGS

56:51.204 --> 56:55.004
That's what my yogi says, and
I'm telling you, he's always right.

56:56.404 --> 56:59.004
Lucien, don't be an idiot.
Come back to work.

59:33.763 --> 59:37.523
Fact: You can immunise your family
against many infectious diseases,

59:37.603 --> 59:39.043
but not the most common of all,

59:39.123 --> 59:40.163
food poisoning -

59:40.243 --> 59:41.483
often caught from raw meat

59:41.563 --> 59:43.163
and the surfaces that it touches.

59:43.803 --> 59:47.323
Dettol Surface Cleanser
kills 99.9% of bacteria,

59:47.403 --> 59:50.163
wherever food has been prepared.

59:53.643 --> 59:56.922
Fact: The flu virus can live
on surfaces for up to two days.

59:57.042 --> 01:00:00.682
Dettol Disinfectant Spray kills
99.9% of cold and flu viruses.

01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:05.682
Rebecca!

01:00:05.842 --> 01:00:08.122
I have to tell you,
that looks absolutely exhausting!

01:00:08.282 --> 01:00:10.842
Is it disappointing to you
that you do this strenuous stuff

01:00:11.002 --> 01:00:12.882
and yet your cholesterol
is still raised?

01:00:13.002 --> 01:00:14.282
Well, yes. Yes, it is.

01:00:14.442 --> 01:00:16.042
As you know,
I was quite taken aback.

01:00:16.202 --> 01:00:18.642
So in total, then, what differences
have you made every day?

01:00:18.802 --> 01:00:21.122
I've introduced
the pro.activ drinks.

01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:22.962
So I have one of those
with a meal every day.

01:00:23.122 --> 01:00:24.842
I'm having
my three portions a day.

01:00:24.962 --> 01:00:26.562
My yoghurt in the morning,

01:00:26.682 --> 01:00:28.322
milk in my tea all day long,

01:00:28.482 --> 01:00:31.642
and I'll have the spread
on baked potato or toast.

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.402
It's just part of the day,
part of my life.

01:00:33.562 --> 01:00:37.162
You too can reduce your cholesterol
level with Flora pro.activ.

01:00:37.322 --> 01:00:39.882
But have our volunteers
managed to reduce theirs?

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:42.202
Join us next week and find out.

01:00:43.802 --> 01:00:45.362
I'm happy because I'm online!

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.082
You think I'm selling car insurance?

01:00:47.162 --> 01:00:48.922
Well I'm not, I'm selling time...

01:00:49.002 --> 01:00:50.602
..and time is money.

01:00:50.802 --> 01:00:52.562
Get a life!
Get Swiftcovered!
