WEBVTT

00:13.056 --> 00:14.405
MELISSA:
Doesn't even matter
what time I wake up.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.842
That boy is in the hallway,
asking me questions

00:16.886 --> 00:19.193
like I memorize
the encyclopedia in my sleep.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.455
4:00 in the morning.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.413
Child in his dinosaur pajamas
staring at you.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.198
Strong argument
for living alone.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.113
You know,
but even when he frustrates me,

00:26.156 --> 00:27.331
just gives me
those wide eyes,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.377
and I'm all the way
in love again.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.422
KARL: How many routes
you run, Melissa?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.424
MELISSA:
Oh, about 30 or so, I guess.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.123
2,600 and counting for me.

00:36.166 --> 00:39.039
Want to know the most
important lesson I learned?Hmm?

00:39.082 --> 00:41.737
We don't have to talk
the entire time.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.870
Sorry, Karl.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.667
[panting]

00:58.710 --> 01:00.669
[coughs, grunting]

01:00.712 --> 01:02.018
[Melissa groans]

01:02.062 --> 01:03.367
Help.

01:03.411 --> 01:06.109
You okay?Oh...

01:06.153 --> 01:07.284
What happened?

01:07.328 --> 01:09.852
We're being hit.
Need you to Mayday.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.551
Melissa, Mayday now!

01:13.595 --> 01:15.075
[groaning]

01:18.165 --> 01:19.340
Hello, dispatch.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.124
This is car 11. Mayday.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.826
No problem here.
We're not resisting.

01:33.310 --> 01:36.270
Uh, dispatch. Car 11.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.142
Mayday. Mayday.[footsteps approaching]

01:41.840 --> 01:43.842
â™ª

01:55.724 --> 01:57.552
TENNANT:
Captain Milius.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.423
Not every day

01:59.467 --> 02:01.817
the deputy chief of staff
of Pacific Fleet comes by.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.732
Have I annoyed Pac Fleet
in some way?

02:03.775 --> 02:05.560
Not that I'm aware of.

02:05.603 --> 02:08.128
Well, it's still early.

02:10.173 --> 02:13.176
Armored truck heist on the
North Shore this morning.Saw it on the wire.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.483
One guard murdered.
Used some kind of explosives.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.659
One of our warships recovered
a half million dollars

02:17.702 --> 02:19.182
from an unflagged vessel.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.619
Belongs to the Thai
government. The money was

02:21.663 --> 02:23.012
on the truck.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.840
HPD's on the crime scene
with FBI. We'll coordinate

02:24.883 --> 02:26.798
a briefing later.Thais would like
their money back.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.757
Given your success
with the spy ring,

02:28.800 --> 02:30.454
the admiral
would like you to take the lead.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.502
It's a lot of money.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.679
I'm guessing there's more?

02:37.722 --> 02:40.421
Whoever did this
used enough explosives

02:40.464 --> 02:42.858
to roll an armored truck
30 yards,

02:42.901 --> 02:44.294
and only a small group
of people

02:44.338 --> 02:45.643
knew the money
would even be there.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.602
You think it's a
military nexus.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.647
We hope not.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.347
Lucy?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.305
Heading to the North Shore?

02:57.525 --> 02:59.135
JESSE:
Whoa.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.441
Since you're new, Kai,

03:00.484 --> 03:02.530
maybe you don't know,
but we don't really have

03:02.573 --> 03:06.229
a "bring your pet to an
active crime scene" day.Stay.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.971
Landlord at my place
is making a stink, okay?

03:09.014 --> 03:11.278
Wants more money
'cause he claims that Inoki's

03:11.321 --> 03:13.454
not, like, pet-sized.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.674
Dude's trying to kick me out,
so I'm in the process of finding

03:16.718 --> 03:19.373
other options.Jesse. Kai.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.465
According to the FBI, the
truck was en route from Pearl.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.467
Three-man heist crew
comes in.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.859
Takes out the driver.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.774
His weapon's
still holstered.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.994
He didn't put up
much of a fight.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.910
No sign of explosives in here.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.260
How'd they get in?TENNANT:
Second guard opened it.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.915
Heist crew took the money
and escaped in a stolen van,

03:39.958 --> 03:42.309
which HPD found in flames
four miles up the road.KAI: Yeah?

03:42.352 --> 03:45.268
Where's the second guard?At HPD. Lucy's
talking to her.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.487
And we didn't get
any of the footage

03:46.530 --> 03:47.662
from the truck's cameras?

03:47.705 --> 03:49.751
No, the security cameras
were off-line.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.407
What is it, Jesse?

03:53.450 --> 03:55.844
I mean, these guys were good.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.412
Like, really good.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.718
In and out.
No muss. No fuss.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.938
Well, somefuss.JESSE:
Yeah,

04:02.981 --> 04:04.853
but that's the thing. Why
would they take out the driver

04:04.896 --> 04:06.507
and leave
guard number two alive?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.726
That's
a really good question.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.342
I just need you to run through
it one more time, Melissa.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.344
I already talked to
those other people.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.563
FBI. Company investigators.

04:19.607 --> 04:20.869
I...

04:20.912 --> 04:23.263
Oh, my phone. They took it.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.612
The robbers?

04:24.655 --> 04:26.483
The police.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.833
I'm sure
they'll give it back.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.271
I need to call my son.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.535
He's at my mother's. Want
to let him know I'm okay.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.537
Are you okay?

04:36.580 --> 04:39.888
I watched Karl get killed.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.846
Thought they
were gonna kill me, too.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.326
So no.

04:44.719 --> 04:48.026
What happened, Melissa,
after the explosion?

04:48.070 --> 04:49.680
[sighs]

04:49.724 --> 04:51.421
Karl got out of the cab.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.728
Which is against protocol.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.078
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.820
Karl got out, was shot.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.910
I called Mayday
until they put a gun to my head,

05:01.953 --> 05:03.651
and then I did
what they told me.

05:03.694 --> 05:04.826
And what was that?

05:04.869 --> 05:06.741
Open the back.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.830
Get on your knees.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.788
Pray to God.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.878
I remember that part
very clearly.

05:13.922 --> 05:16.707
I'd like to call my son.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.319
Gonna make sure that happens.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.582
I just want to go back
to one thing.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.671
You say you call for Mayday.[sighs]

05:23.714 --> 05:24.933
I didcall Mayday.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.630
The thing is, Melissa,

05:26.674 --> 05:29.807
dispatch didn't receive
any calls.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.810
The truck's whole
security system was off-line.

05:32.854 --> 05:37.075
So... maybe let's go
over it again.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.470
JESSE:
Bank robberies

05:40.514 --> 05:42.777
are simple. Suspect walks in
with nothing but intent.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.866
Since the tellers
are trained to comply,

05:44.909 --> 05:46.607
walks out
with all the cash at the window.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.697
Armored truck heists
are a whole other game.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.134
Suspects tend to be brazen
and violent,

05:52.177 --> 05:53.875
willing to take risks.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.964
Dude, you know a lot about this.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.400
Jesse's got three years

05:57.444 --> 05:59.315
with the D.C. Joint Robbery
Task Force.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.664
JESSE:
This is a precision crew.

06:00.708 --> 06:01.970
In and out in 90 seconds.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.973
Not one scrap of usable evidence
was left behind.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.976
Getaway car was stolen
and then torched.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.804
Ballistics report came back
with nothing.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.414
Every move was planned.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.547
What, even killing the guard?

06:13.590 --> 06:15.592
Look at the grouping of bullets.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.639
Two above the armored
vest and one in the head.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.728
This wasn't just some suspect
spraying off rounds.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.165
And ATF thinks the explosives
are military grade.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.080
I have Marine EOD
checking it out.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.387
Any luck finding a local
who could do this job?

06:27.430 --> 06:30.172
No. The best
are either locked up or dead.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.000
The rest, small-time.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.436
So it's probably mainlanders.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.916
But importing
that much explosives

06:34.959 --> 06:36.439
is almost impossible.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.745
They must have some help
on the island.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.703
And luck from the gods

06:39.747 --> 06:42.924
considering the bomb probably
took out the security system.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.056
ERNIE:
Luck had nothing to do with it.

06:46.754 --> 06:50.410
I went down the rabbit hole
of armored truck construction.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.107
Marvel of engineering.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.764
Forged in galvanized
and stainless steel

06:56.807 --> 06:59.375
with ballistic fiberglass
woven into the interior.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.681
And the security system?

07:00.724 --> 07:03.901
Cradled in an equally
impenetrable steel casing

07:03.945 --> 07:05.816
controlling
the electronic locks,

07:05.860 --> 07:07.688
the cameras, the comms

07:07.731 --> 07:09.820
with a static crush resistance

07:09.864 --> 07:11.779
of 5,000 pounds.JESSE:
In other words,

07:11.822 --> 07:13.694
the kaboom
couldn't take it off-line.

07:13.737 --> 07:14.956
KAI:
Then what would've caused it?

07:14.999 --> 07:17.219
Because right before
the system went down,

07:17.262 --> 07:19.874
the truck made
an unscheduled stop.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.485
There's your local.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.139
Inside man.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.793
Or woman.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.144
I'm sorry, who are you?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.798
She's my boss, Melissa.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.540
TENNANT:
We want to know
why your truck's security system

07:33.583 --> 07:35.237
was deactivated
before you were hit.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.981
Okay, I took a two-week course
before starting this job.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.939
I don't know anything
about computers.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.071
You're saying
you followed procedure

07:43.114 --> 07:44.725
every step of the way
this morning?

07:44.768 --> 07:46.509
I tried.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.772
You tried? Or you did?

07:48.816 --> 07:50.208
Because you told me
you were by the book.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.775
We were.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.125
Then help me understand
why your truck's GPS

07:54.169 --> 07:57.085
was idle for two minutes
on Farrington Highway.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.608
You made
an unscheduled stop.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.480
Karl had to relieve himself.

08:00.523 --> 08:01.959
It was, like, 30 seconds.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.526
It was two minutes.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.876
Officers checked the area.
They didn't find anything.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.748
What happened there?Nothing.

08:07.791 --> 08:12.230
Been interviewed
by FBI, HPD, me.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.710
You didn't tell anyone
about this.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.843
He did it from time to time.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.759
Bad prostate, Karl said.
It's not a big deal.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.935
Kind of a big deal this time,
Melissa.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.110
Karl was murdered.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.503
TENNANT:
Unscheduled stop.

08:23.546 --> 08:24.895
Security system shut off.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.941
We want to believe
you're not responsible.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.682
But I'm responsible.

08:28.725 --> 08:29.987
What?

08:32.207 --> 08:35.123
I'm the reason why Karl's dead.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.169
[phones ringing, chiming]

08:39.344 --> 08:40.998
[phone buzzes]

08:42.957 --> 08:45.176
Heist crew just pulled off
another job.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.971
Target was Payday Plus
near Village Park.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.539
About 2:00 p.m., bomb exploded,

08:59.582 --> 09:00.888
taking out a wall
between the store

09:00.931 --> 09:02.716
and neighboring restaurant.Any injuries?

09:02.759 --> 09:05.588
Yeah, two employees were taken
to Aloha Memorial.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.547
Three-man team pushed
through the wall,

09:07.590 --> 09:08.939
forced the manager
to open the vault

09:08.983 --> 09:10.767
and fled with nearly 400K.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.552
Wow.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
Let me guess. 90 seconds flat.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.642
TENNANT:
Looks like the same team

09:15.685 --> 09:17.295
pulling off
an equally coordinated heist

09:17.339 --> 09:18.819
while we were
still investigating the first.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.603
Tell me what we know.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.953
Well, the blast
took out the CCTV cameras,

09:22.997 --> 09:24.825
but we got
some cell phone footage

09:24.868 --> 09:27.349
from a customer
at the restaurant.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.576
Can you play that back?

09:39.796 --> 09:42.494
You see how they move?
It's a three-second rush.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.279
One man's
always covering the others.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.629
Individual movement technique.
That's military.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.631
Learned it in Marine
field training.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.807
Training may be a lead.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.635
Jesse, look and see
if you can find

09:52.679 --> 09:53.767
any similar heists
off the island.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.507
Anything with flavor
of military tactics

09:55.551 --> 09:57.248
and hardware.All right, on it.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.643
I've got Ernie pulling
security footage from the area.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.514
Somebody planted that bomb
in the restaurant.

10:02.558 --> 10:03.994
One of our heist team

10:04.038 --> 10:05.996
or another local accomplice.Yep.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.390
Melissa's been in custody
since the first robbery,

10:08.433 --> 10:10.218
but she may have details
on other suspects.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.872
I'll have Lucy
talk to her again.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.917
All right.[phone buzzes]

10:13.961 --> 10:16.398
Headed to K-Bay.
You up for a ride?

10:16.441 --> 10:18.008
Time to talk to Boom-Boom.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.662
Hey!

10:19.706 --> 10:22.012
Hey, what's a Boom-Boom?

10:23.057 --> 10:24.928
BOOM-BOOM:
Fire in the hole!

10:29.324 --> 10:30.760
When dealing
with high explosives,

10:30.804 --> 10:32.675
there are really
only two games in town.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.504
Your typical plastics, like C-4,
which we just detonated.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.549
You want a controlled
explosion--

10:37.593 --> 10:40.378
say, take out the lock on
a door before a breach--

10:40.422 --> 10:41.989
you want plastics.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.860
It's also very stable.
Easy to transport.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.689
Almost no chance
of unscheduled bangs.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.518
If you want to take out
an entire building,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.912
let the world know
you're there...

10:51.955 --> 10:53.609
Fire in the hole!

10:58.092 --> 11:00.616
TNT's your wingman.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.574
Hey, no, don't throw that one
at me, please.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.621
Our suspects used
TNT and lots of it.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.755
50 pounds on the armored truck,
another 50 on the Payday wall.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.886
TNT's highly regulated,

11:09.930 --> 11:11.540
nearly impossible
to get legally.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.021
Yeah, let alone transport.
Stuff's not exactly stable.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.587
So how'd our guys
get theirs?

11:15.631 --> 11:17.459
Well, based on chemical
analysis at the blast sites,

11:17.502 --> 11:20.680
you got yourself some original
formula World War II-era TNT.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.508
That's good, old-fashioned
American kick-ass.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.901
Where would our suspects
get their hands

11:24.945 --> 11:26.381
on World War II materials?

11:26.424 --> 11:27.948
I'd look at Kahoolawe.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.733
That island's littered
with antique ordnance.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.605
I know because my unit's
been out there to clear 'em.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.521
All right. Thank you, Boom-Boom.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.915
Only Tennant can call me that.
Listen,

11:38.959 --> 11:41.309
you can't
just row out there

11:41.352 --> 11:43.615
and grab this stuff. It's
temperamental as hell.

11:43.659 --> 11:46.967
Whoever got it knew
what they were doing.

11:48.664 --> 11:49.970
Hey.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.454
Aw, you look how I feel.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.804
Thanks?

11:57.847 --> 11:59.327
I just spent the
last few hours

11:59.370 --> 12:01.285
scouring
law enforcement databases

12:01.329 --> 12:03.766
trying to find a heist crew
that resembles ours.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.115
No hits?I mean, I got

12:05.159 --> 12:06.551
guys who use explosives,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.118
guys who use assault weapons,

12:08.162 --> 12:09.946
but nobody who mixed them

12:09.990 --> 12:12.470
with these kind of results.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.734
What's bothering you?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.737
Got a call
from the medical examiner.

12:17.780 --> 12:21.001
Our dead guard had traces of TNT
on his hands and clothes.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.961
Well, that plus him being
seriously underwater financially

12:25.005 --> 12:27.790
probably means
that Karl is our inside man.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.923
That's what we call
a break, Luce.

12:29.966 --> 12:33.665
Yeah. Yeah, makes it less likely
that Melissa was involved.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.755
Unless they both were.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.669
Karl was executed on the spot.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.584
That's our heist crew
tying up loose ends.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.977
But Melissa was spared.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.718
What's that say to you?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.721
Heist crew wants us
to suspect her.Yeah.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.462
And if she's innocent,
she could still help us

12:47.505 --> 12:49.507
fill in the blanks with Karl.
Do you know where she is?

12:49.551 --> 12:51.422
Not with her son
where she should be.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.989
The FBI took her for
further questioning.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.774
Well, we're lead
on this case, right?

12:54.817 --> 12:55.775
So take the lead.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.037
Go get her.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.827
Oh. Whistler.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.698
Sorry.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.614
I'm just, uh,
looking for Tennant.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.748
Okay. Well, she's around.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.490
Uh, look, the, um...

13:15.533 --> 13:16.534
the other night.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.580
The Joint Terrorism
security brief.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.887
You know what other night
I'm talking about.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.845
When you threw yourself at me?

13:22.889 --> 13:24.847
I'm sorry, it's
just like you said.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.544
We can't do this again.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.677
Sure.We just need to forget
it ever happened.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.680
Bygones.I'm serious.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.116
Me, too.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.553
So, if you'll excuse me...

13:35.597 --> 13:36.685
JESSE:
Whistler.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.817
We're in the war room.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.700
Kahoolawe. Smallest
of the main Hawaiian islands

13:51.743 --> 13:54.572
and a bombing range
for the military until 1990.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.879
Home to millions of pounds
of unexploded ordnance.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.576
Government's
been cleaning it up for years,

13:58.620 --> 13:59.795
but there's still
a lot of UXO

13:59.839 --> 14:01.579
that dates all the way back
to World War II.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.755
Island's over a hundred
miles from Oahu,

14:03.799 --> 14:07.063
so our crew would need a boat,
pilot who knows the area.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.761
Not to mention experience
in handling volatile explosives.

14:09.805 --> 14:13.113
Well, I can't speak to that,
but I can show you this.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.899
Captured ten days ago by NOAA.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.467
Approached the island and stayed
about four hours before leaving.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.077
Looks like a fishing boat.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.036
Is there enough
to identify it?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.255
Worth a college try.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.611
[sighs] I'm just running
an errand, Jesse.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.092
I will be back,
and then we, uh,

14:36.136 --> 14:38.486
can go fishing for boats.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.228
Hey. I never expect you, son.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.707
Hey, Pops.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.100
Just, uh,

14:44.144 --> 14:46.537
just got to grab something.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.148
Thought you'd be
at the restaurant.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.585
Oh, you come when you think
I'm not here.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.848
Should I take that personally?Dad,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
I don't want to fight, okay?Me, neither.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.678
How about I go fix you
something for eat?

14:56.721 --> 14:57.940
No, I can't. I, uh,

14:57.984 --> 14:59.246
got to get back to work.

14:59.289 --> 15:00.900
You taking your medication?

15:00.943 --> 15:01.944
Of course.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.250
Okay.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.950
[Kai exhales]

15:12.346 --> 15:14.957
What you looking for?Sleeping bag.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.872
Big blue one.From high school.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.091
Why?I'm, uh,

15:18.134 --> 15:19.919
having a dispute
with my landlord.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.224
Might've lost my housing,

15:21.268 --> 15:22.834
so just until I figure out
what to do...

15:22.878 --> 15:24.924
Do you want to stay here?

15:27.665 --> 15:29.841
Wh-Where? Under the tree?

15:29.885 --> 15:31.800
I could clean it out.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.280
No. No, thank you, Dad.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.108
You no be hardhead.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.631
Why you no let me help you?

15:36.674 --> 15:39.025
Well, I-I just need
the sleeping bag.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.722
I wen give 'em away.

15:40.765 --> 15:43.072
Your cousin 'Olina
needed for camp.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.856
Plus, was causing clutter.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.075
How could you tell?

15:56.085 --> 15:58.261
WALLY:
If she was still around,

15:58.305 --> 16:00.133
she would tell you to stay.

16:02.309 --> 16:06.400
If she was still around,
I wouldn't have left.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.449
TENNANT:
Oh, that's good, Jules.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.364
Might want to spread the silver
fish out just a little more.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.366
Akule travel in schools.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.629
Oh, I thought
they were bluefin tuna.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.675
Which also travel in schools.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.198
Oh.[computer ringing]

16:25.114 --> 16:27.073
Fourth grade ecosystems?

16:27.116 --> 16:28.335
"Wonders of the Ocean."

16:28.378 --> 16:30.206
Yeah, nice.
I was up until 4:00 a.m.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.034
"helping" Gracie with that one.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.080
I will not be up that late.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.299
And neither will you.JESSE:
I got follow-up

16:36.343 --> 16:38.171
on the Whistler intel.
You want to come in,

16:38.214 --> 16:40.129
or should I sanitize it?The latter.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.045
We ID'd the boat.
It's a type mostly used

16:43.089 --> 16:44.786
for multiday fishing charters.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.006
Got plenty of range
to make the round trip.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.790
You pulling a list
of locals on the island?

16:48.833 --> 16:52.924
Yeah, new guy-- I mean, Kai--
and I are looking into it.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.056
There's only about 20.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.231
So you're thinking
some local fisherman

16:55.275 --> 16:56.667
got caught up
with our heist crew?

16:56.711 --> 16:58.104
The dead guard had debt issues.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.236
I mean, the fishing biz
isn't what it used to be.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.630
I'm sure a lot of these guys
could use the extra cash.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.762
We're also looking for someone
with explosives training.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.895
Not sure the boatman's
a logical choice,

17:06.938 --> 17:08.984
but not impossible.[doorbell rings]

17:09.028 --> 17:11.900
Thanks for the update.
I'll check in later.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.946
Hi.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.297
I know you weren't
expecting me. I'm sorry.

17:17.340 --> 17:20.169
I, um... brought cake.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.302
Hey, Julie.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.260
Hi.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.783
It's from Leonard's.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.437
I passed it
after I sprung Melissa

17:27.481 --> 17:29.787
from the FBI
and dropped her at home.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.137
How's she doing?

17:32.181 --> 17:33.313
She's a wreck.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.271
You, too, huh?

17:35.315 --> 17:39.101
Otherwise,
why would you bring me cake?

17:39.145 --> 17:41.234
Her company suspended her.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.062
She's probably gonna lose
her job.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.066
Everyone suspects her.
I kind of did, too.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.504
It might not be my fault,
but I didn't help.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.943
You're gonna interview a lot
of witnesses in your career.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.467
They're gonna be scared.
Confused. Angry.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.340
It's up to you to learn
how to filter out what's useful

18:00.383 --> 18:01.993
and what's emotion.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.648
I remember my training.
Talk them through the facts.

18:04.692 --> 18:07.347
I've taken her through her story
a dozen times.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.826
She doesn't know anything.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.699
About the attack.
But what about before?

18:11.742 --> 18:14.136
If Karl was involved,
maybe she saw something.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.747
Last thing she's gonna want
to do is talk to another cop.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.749
You're not another cop, Lucy.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.404
You're the one
who brought her home to her son.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.059
But first...

18:25.104 --> 18:26.409
...cake.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.803
[chuckles softly]

18:28.846 --> 18:31.501
Next case we work should be
going after these charter owners

18:31.545 --> 18:33.155
for their prices,
man. Criminal.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.288
Hey, you have no idea
how expensive it is

18:35.331 --> 18:36.767
to run a small
business here.

18:36.811 --> 18:40.031
Equipment,
fuel costs. Rent.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.251
You sort your rent
situation out?

18:42.295 --> 18:44.210
I, um, tried
to find a place,

18:44.253 --> 18:47.256
but housing on the island's
impossible these days.[phone chimes]

18:47.300 --> 18:50.129
Yeah, well, everybody
wants to live in paradise.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.435
Yeah.Ernie just sent
video footage

18:52.479 --> 18:54.045
from the restaurant
next to the Payday Plus,

18:54.089 --> 18:56.352
the site
of the second blast.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.180
When did he go in?

18:58.224 --> 19:00.748
20 minutes
before the explosion.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.445
What, he looks familiar?

19:09.104 --> 19:10.453
Lester Allyn.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.499
Charter boat captain.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.286
Maybe we make a
good team after all.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.333
[chuckles]
Yeah. Shucks.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.944
And you ruined it.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.387
Captain Lester's
got some money issues.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.868
Boat and business
mortgaged to the hilt.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.218
Yeah, same as
our guard Karl.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.916
There. There he is.Hey, Lester Allyn?

19:38.960 --> 19:41.180

is with NCIS.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.314
Hey, bro, doesn't like
being called that.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.141
Oh, just don't like
it when you do.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.534
I don't know you.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.234
So, can we assume
it wasn't a coincidence

20:35.277 --> 20:37.540
that Lester exploded
while trying to evade capture?

20:37.584 --> 20:38.933
Uh...

20:38.976 --> 20:41.718
Found remnants of a pressure
plate detonation device.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.373
He stepped on it.
No more Lester.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.419
So our heist
team set him up?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.857
You're
in the conclusion business.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.164
I'm in the explosive business.
And this one was

20:53.208 --> 20:56.820
a classic World War II-era
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.257
How can you be sure?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.084
Residue pattern.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.651
It suggests the explosives
got wet on the boat,

21:01.695 --> 21:03.827
which caused the
nitroglycerin to leach away.

21:03.871 --> 21:07.744
Similar explosives to the ones
used on our other robberies?Identical.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.399
How many of these bombs
did they take off Kahoolawe?

21:10.443 --> 21:12.314
BOOM-BOOM:
Judging by the empty
casings we found

21:12.358 --> 21:14.360
inside the boathouse,
there's another 50 pounds

21:14.403 --> 21:16.318
of highly unstable TNT
out there.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.320
JESSE:
Crew's clearly got plans

21:18.364 --> 21:19.930
for another job.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.410
Hey, this handiwork here

21:21.454 --> 21:22.890
tell you anything
about these suspects?

21:22.933 --> 21:24.413
Jesse, haven't
seen craftsmanship

21:24.457 --> 21:26.154
like this pressure
plate since Iraq.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.288
British SAS
written all over it.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.857
Ah, Melissa came through.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.294
Mm-hmm.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.905
Took her to the field
where Karl relieved himself.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.950
Figured it might help her
remember something new.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.605
She said he wandered pretty far
from the truck. Showed me where.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.781
Found this buried in a ravine,

21:44.825 --> 21:46.783
well away
from where the truck stopped.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.612
Take it to Ernie. He'll
get something off it.Mm-hmm.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.266
Hey.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.354
Nice job.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
[knock on door]

21:54.400 --> 21:56.402
Captain Milius.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.534
Special Agent.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.144
Tara.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.232
Excuse me?

22:01.276 --> 22:02.451
Her last name.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.671
First name Lucy.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.020
I knew that.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.372
I didn't know that.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.721
Thank you.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.768
You here about an update?

22:14.811 --> 22:18.337
Two robberies. Two murders.
Three massive explosions.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.642
Chain of command
breathing down your neck

22:19.686 --> 22:20.904
about their stolen money?

22:20.948 --> 22:22.558
Technically,
the Thai government's

22:22.602 --> 22:23.777
twice-stolen money.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.648
It'd help
if I wasn't getting all my intel

22:25.692 --> 22:27.955
from the nightly news,
so I guess I'm wondering

22:27.998 --> 22:30.871
how youthink
the investigation is going.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.655
About how investigations go.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.962
When exactly does the solving
the crime part come in?

22:35.005 --> 22:36.529
It's a little like pornography.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.314
We'll know it when we see it.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.360
Not sure the metaphor's
gonna fly with the admiral.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.232
He's more of a defined outcomes
kind of guy.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.321
Look,
we've done this dance before.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.844
"It's not just my job
on the line

22:47.888 --> 22:49.280
but yours, my whole team's."

22:49.324 --> 22:51.282
We're just worried.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.372
And I would say understandably.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.547
[phone buzzing]

22:58.594 --> 23:00.204
Let me do the worrying.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.815
I'll let you know
when it's your turn.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.513
[door slides open]

23:05.601 --> 23:07.429
Hey. Everything's pointing

23:07.473 --> 23:09.039
towards military training
with these guys.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.563
Boom-Boom said
that the booby trap

23:10.606 --> 23:11.955
could be
British Special Forces,

23:11.999 --> 23:15.394
so I expanded the search
internationally

23:15.437 --> 23:19.702
and found a series
of heists in Europe.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.704
Diamonds in Antwerp.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.314
Casino haul in Monte Carlo.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.794
Currency slotted
for destruction in Munich.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.057
Yeah. In each of these cases,
they made off

23:27.101 --> 23:30.278
with $5 million-plus in cash
or easy to monetize assets.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.540
Local police were left

23:31.584 --> 23:33.281
with a trail
of dead accomplices.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.978
But our crew's haul
was barely seven figures.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.415
Yeah, that's their thing.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.721
This crew does a handful
of smaller jobs first.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.419
Gets the cops chasing
their own tails.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.508
Gives this crew
a chance to slip in

23:42.551 --> 23:43.857
and pull off the big score.Mm-hmm.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.075
Okay, we have a pattern.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.425
Any suspects?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.514
Interpol managed
to ID one suspect

23:48.557 --> 23:49.689
from the Antwerp job.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.431
William Strafford,
British SAS.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.823
Yeah, served in Iraq.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
Worked risk management
for Newcastle Protections.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.653
A security specialist.Trained

23:57.697 --> 24:01.265
in urban combat,
explosives, intelligence.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.963
He's got all the skills.
Where is this guy?

24:03.006 --> 24:05.269
Off the grid after Antwerp.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.923
What about the
rest of his team?

24:06.967 --> 24:09.839
No likely suspects
in his SAS unit,

24:09.883 --> 24:12.494
but Strafford was attached

24:12.538 --> 24:15.758
to a classified
special operations unit in Iraq.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.020
International coalition

24:17.064 --> 24:19.588
including Australian
and French forces.

24:19.632 --> 24:20.981
All right. Well, see if any
of these guys had trouble

24:21.024 --> 24:22.330
adjusting to civilian life.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.592
I'm gonna have Lucy
compile a list

24:23.636 --> 24:24.941
of high-value targets
here on the islands

24:24.985 --> 24:26.987
just in case they're aimed
at something bigger.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.031
All right.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.471
[knife chopping]

24:32.514 --> 24:34.951
Bro. You're here late.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.605
You mean early.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.565
Well, it's early today, but
if you sleep in the office

24:39.608 --> 24:41.436
and shower in the locker room,

24:41.480 --> 24:42.916
it's really just an extension
of yesterday.[pours kibble]

24:42.959 --> 24:46.136
Well, we didn't sleep here.
We napped.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.964
Well, semantics, Kai.

24:48.008 --> 24:51.359
Midnight to 7:00 a.m. two
nights in a row isn't napping.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.970
Look, I get it. You,
uh, you like your dog.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.798
KAI:
Look,

24:55.842 --> 24:57.104
we just

24:57.147 --> 24:58.801
trying to figure out...

25:04.415 --> 25:06.548
Figure out my living situation.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.723
Well, squatting
in the break room

25:07.767 --> 25:09.595
isn't living, my friend.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.598
Hey, you want a place
to stay, just ask.No.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.600
No, I'm not one to impose.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.689
Want me to ask around
for sublets?

25:16.732 --> 25:19.169
Thank you, but, uh, I've
been taking care of myself

25:19.213 --> 25:22.085
a long time. I got this.[chuckles]

25:25.132 --> 25:28.657
You think being self-sufficient
keeps you above the fray.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.660
You don't owe anyone anything,
and they don't owe you.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.794
But that just makes you a man
alone on an island with his dog.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.491
A metaphorical island.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.928
'Cause, obviously,
we're all on a...

25:38.972 --> 25:40.539
real island.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.714
The point is, uh,

25:41.757 --> 25:42.932
you're bumming us out.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.109
"Us"?

25:46.153 --> 25:48.721
"Us" as in, like, like,
everyone? Like, Tennant, too?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.549
If I were you,

25:50.592 --> 25:52.768
I'd figure this out
sooner than later.[phone chimes]

25:52.812 --> 25:54.857
Just-just... Okay, wait.

25:54.901 --> 25:58.034
Help me understand why-why
me sleeping here all night

25:58.078 --> 26:01.690
is a problem, but for you,
it's okay. Is that...?

26:01.734 --> 26:03.692
[scoffs]

26:03.736 --> 26:06.652
I don't sleep here. I work.

26:06.695 --> 26:09.480
For instance, while you
and Inoki snored away,

26:09.524 --> 26:11.874
I reconstructed
Karl's phone,

26:11.918 --> 26:14.877
which may have given us
a lead on our suspects.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.706
Oh, you-you can have the rest
if you want.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.580
We contacted banks,

26:21.623 --> 26:23.190
insurance companies
and auction houses

26:23.233 --> 26:26.672
to gather a list of
high-value assets on the island.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.587
Eliminated items that would
be difficult to unload

26:28.630 --> 26:30.458
or too hot
once they were stolen.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.634
That still left
11 possible targets.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.070
All right, we need to
narrow it down further.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.551
$5 million-plus and anything
who's set to move soon

26:36.595 --> 26:37.987
or whose protection would
be recently affected

26:38.031 --> 26:39.249
by the previous heists.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.947
Will do.JESSE:
We also got a hit

26:40.990 --> 26:42.252
on Lieutenant Henri Martin.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.819
Former French commando.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.778
Served with Strafford.
Had a hard time

26:45.821 --> 26:48.084
reentering civilian life.
In and out of jail.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.912
He just arrived in Oahu

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
on "vacation."Where is he now?

26:52.045 --> 26:53.786
ERNIE:
Uh, best guess?

26:53.829 --> 26:55.265
Chinatown.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.266
How do you know?

26:56.310 --> 26:57.703
Karl's burner phone

26:57.746 --> 26:59.530
only had a couple calls
in the last few days,

26:59.574 --> 27:00.967
and I just got a ping
from one of the numbers.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.925
Encrypted phone. It just
keeps going on and off-line,

27:02.969 --> 27:06.712
but I've been able to find it
every time it comes back.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.104
Honolulu National's
in Chinatown.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.889
That's on your list.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.065
Received a federal cash deposit
this week

27:12.108 --> 27:14.589
topping $7 million.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.287
Lucy, call it in.

27:17.331 --> 27:18.637
Jesse and Ernie,

27:18.680 --> 27:19.986
you're with me.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.777
[engine turns off]

27:29.778 --> 27:32.172
Not sure this, uh,
fits exactly right.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.261
You know, I don't usually
go out in the field,

27:34.304 --> 27:36.002
and by "usually," I mean "ever."

27:36.045 --> 27:38.221
Yeah, well, we need you to track
these guys in real time.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.180
Don't want a dropped call
with 50 pounds of TNT

27:40.223 --> 27:41.964
roaming through the
city, all right?Okay.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.836
Any updates?

27:43.879 --> 27:45.838
Yep. About 45 yards

27:45.881 --> 27:48.188
from our position
and heading straight for the...There.

27:48.231 --> 27:49.885
Guy in the coat.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.888
Jesse, cover the other entrance.
Wait for backup.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.687
This is a robbery![bystanders screaming]

28:08.730 --> 28:11.994
Everybody,
stay where you are!

28:12.038 --> 28:13.735
Nobody move!

28:13.779 --> 28:15.737
Down! You, down! Don't move!

28:23.397 --> 28:25.791
[bystanders whimpering]MAN:
Lady! On the ground.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.053
Down.[whispers]: Okay.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.882
You, too.[tablet camera clicks, whirring]

28:30.883 --> 28:33.581
Facial recognition.
Just in case.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.843
MAN:
Stay where you are.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.018
TENNANT:
Sir?

28:39.239 --> 28:41.328
Everyone's gonna stay calm.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.069
No one's getting hurt.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.897
You want to be in charge?

28:47.377 --> 28:49.771
Take the money
from the vault.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.338
Put it in the bag.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.297
Okay, we're federal agents,
not bank employees.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.865
I'm not authorized
to handle the money.

28:56.909 --> 29:00.826
But I can take this bag
to the manager.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.871
I'm Eli Kealoha.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.133
Assistant manager.MAN: Will you just
give him the bag?

29:04.177 --> 29:05.265
Everybody else,

29:05.308 --> 29:08.094
down on the ground! Down!Eli, listen.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.399
You and me are gonna
keep everyone calm,

29:09.443 --> 29:11.010
okay?
Just follow instructions.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.620
Come on! Come on!

29:12.663 --> 29:13.752
Open this door.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.625
[door unlocks]All right, money in the
bag. Money in the bag.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.322
TENNANT:
Okay.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.194
We did what you wanted.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.935
What happens next?

29:22.978 --> 29:25.067
I leave.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.853
My colleagues are waiting for me
outside in a van.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.855
[sirens wailing]

29:29.898 --> 29:31.900
There's no van.
And even if there was,

29:31.944 --> 29:34.163
HPD's locking
this whole thing down right now.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.165
[siren continues wailing]

29:36.209 --> 29:39.255
Okay. His name
is Hugh Lowry.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.301
He's in the federal database.
Private contractor,

29:41.344 --> 29:43.999
explosives disposal.
Has a lien on his house.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.310
Jesse, he's not supposed
to have a way out.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.181
He's a diversion.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.314
Get back to the asset list
and find the real target.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
You want me to leave you
in there?

29:55.881 --> 29:57.665
There's nothing else
you can do except get Lucy

29:57.708 --> 29:59.014
and find the heist team.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.325
Hugh Lowry.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.327
Right?

30:07.370 --> 30:08.894
[helicopter blades whirring]

30:08.937 --> 30:11.331
H-H-How do you know my name?

30:11.374 --> 30:14.290
I know everything, Hugh.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.945
You're working
with guys from Europe.

30:16.989 --> 30:19.992
They took you to Kahoolawe

30:20.035 --> 30:22.124
on Lester Allyn's boat

30:22.168 --> 30:23.691
to get explosives.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.432
Okay, shut up!TENNANT:
Promised you this

30:25.475 --> 30:26.868
would be easy,

30:26.912 --> 30:28.914
help you out
with your money troubles.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.960
They lied.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.310
There's no van.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.703
And, as you can hear,

30:35.746 --> 30:37.792
HPD is already on the scene.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.402
You're a distraction

30:39.446 --> 30:41.187
to another job.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.844
You're just trying
to get in my head.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.282
They already killed
two other accomplices.

30:50.370 --> 30:51.893
LUCY:
What, you're just
leaving her there?

30:51.937 --> 30:52.981
JESSE:
That's what Tennant wants.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.417
But what I need is
the real target.

30:54.461 --> 30:55.984
We're looking
for anything that's vulnerable

30:56.028 --> 30:58.857
because HPD is evacuating
Chinatown as we speak.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.338
Tears of the Sea.JESSE:
Tears of the what?

31:02.382 --> 31:04.732
Black pearl necklace.
Handed down through generations

31:04.775 --> 31:06.212
of Hawaiian royalty.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.910
Culturally priceless
and financially worth

31:08.954 --> 31:11.260
probably more than anything else
on our list.JESSE: All right.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.827
We're only gonna get one chance
at this.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.350
This is a prize, Jesse.
It's being moved

31:14.394 --> 31:15.874
from the Bishop Museum today.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.919
Only item on our list
with private security

31:17.963 --> 31:20.226
and HPD escort.JESSE:
Which will be diverted

31:20.269 --> 31:22.228
because HPD's responding
to the bank robbery.

31:22.271 --> 31:25.013
Great work, Lucy.
Tell me where we're going.

31:26.362 --> 31:29.017
It isn't supposed to go
this way.Hugh, listen to me.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.802
Listen. Hugh, look at me.

31:32.803 --> 31:35.806
I don't want you to die.
Let us help.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.069
Yeah, you want to help me?

31:37.112 --> 31:39.158
We do. Right, Ernie?

31:39.201 --> 31:42.552
Yes. Definitely, yes.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.598
Such an idiot!

31:47.253 --> 31:49.298
I-I-I got to get out
of this thing.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.214
I-I don't want to...No. No. No, no, no. No. No.

31:52.258 --> 31:55.043
That vest.
Like Lester Allyn's boat.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.132
Any false move and...
[imitates explosion]

31:57.176 --> 31:58.873
Okay, okay,
get Boom-Boom on the phone.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.570
Hugh, new plan. Don't touch

32:00.614 --> 32:02.790
the vest. I'm not gonna
touch it, either.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.879
Right here with you.
Give me your hand.

32:07.969 --> 32:11.407
Okay. Okay. Okay.

32:11.451 --> 32:12.931
The people you're working for

32:12.974 --> 32:14.454
promised you that this vest
wouldn't hurt you.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.284
But you can't know that.

32:20.329 --> 32:24.333
Oh, God. Oh, God.We're gonna fix this, okay?

32:27.162 --> 32:29.164
H-How?

32:31.514 --> 32:34.256
Um, we, uh, we...

32:34.300 --> 32:37.999
we need some images to send back
to HQ. Get a quick consult.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.480
Y-You're gonna fix this
with pictures?

32:40.523 --> 32:42.438
X-rays, actually.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.266
Just, um...

32:44.310 --> 32:45.876
[zipper rasps]

32:47.313 --> 32:50.316
I brought this in case we
came up against a bomb.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.232
What do you got?

32:53.275 --> 32:55.451
All of them
look the same to me, man.

32:55.495 --> 32:58.280
Bunch of crazy wires.
I hope it makes sense to you.BOOM-BOOM: It doesn't, really.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.108
Ernie, you got to get in closer.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.892
How much closer?

33:01.936 --> 33:04.330
Can you get me a shot looking
lengthwise across the detonator?

33:04.373 --> 33:06.201
And don't be coy, Ernie.
If this thing

33:06.245 --> 33:07.724
goes off,
a few steps here or there

33:07.768 --> 33:09.291
won't make a bit of...Boom-Boom, we can all hear you.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.295
It looks like the bomb

33:13.339 --> 33:15.036
is designed to go off
as soon as he removes it.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.952
Ernie, we'll need to rewire
a loop around the detonator.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.911
Isn't there a red wire, blue
wire kind of thing we can do?

33:20.955 --> 33:23.349
That's only in the movies,
Ernie. In the real world,

33:23.392 --> 33:25.481
bombs are complex
electrical devices that provide

33:25.525 --> 33:27.005
power to a detonator.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.615
Oh, wait, like the...
like the power system

33:28.658 --> 33:30.617
that runs a drive in a computer.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.140
I got this.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.015
Hey.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.321
Look at me. Look at me.

33:39.365 --> 33:40.931
Okay.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.455
These men who hired you,

33:42.498 --> 33:44.326
they convinced you
to do this job.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.501
How?

33:45.545 --> 33:48.113
They, uh...
[breathing heavily]

33:48.156 --> 33:50.506
They said no one gave a crap
about me in the world.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.074
BOOM-BOOM:
You got this, Ernie.

33:55.555 --> 33:58.340
Hugh, I'm still with you,
okay? You're doing great.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.385
What else did they say?

33:59.428 --> 34:01.169
That they understood.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.562
They could help.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.268
ERNIE [whispers]:Okay.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.183
Okay, Boom-Boom,
you seeing what I'm seeing?

34:17.577 --> 34:19.144
BOOM-BOOM:
Yeah.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.971
Unbelievable.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.408
Wh-What-What's going on?

34:22.451 --> 34:23.409
What is it?TENNANT:
Right here.

34:23.452 --> 34:26.673
They understood, right?

34:26.716 --> 34:29.154
They understood 'cause they know
what it feels like

34:29.197 --> 34:31.417
to be left behind.

34:31.460 --> 34:34.637
Uh... yeah.

34:35.682 --> 34:38.119
Am I doing this, Boom-Boom?

34:38.163 --> 34:39.338
You're doing it.

34:39.381 --> 34:42.080
Doing what? Doing what?Hugh, look at me.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.082
These men.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.041
Did they ask for anything else?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.651
Hugh.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.090
Anything else?

34:52.133 --> 34:54.396
BOOM-BOOM:
Nice and steady, Ernie.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.182
They wanted a plane.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.098
[exhales shakily]

35:00.141 --> 35:01.142
What just happened?

35:01.186 --> 35:03.231
[exhales]
Nothing.

35:03.275 --> 35:04.972
Movie bomb.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.235
It was a fake.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.281
BOOM-BOOM:
Nice work, Ernie.

35:10.673 --> 35:14.024
Those last 50 pounds of TNT
are still out there.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.984
Jesse?

35:17.027 --> 35:19.029
What do you know?[tires squealing]

35:19.073 --> 35:21.075
JESSE:
Tears of the Sea

35:21.119 --> 35:23.077
left the Bishop Museum
while we were at the bank.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.557
I'm five out from their route.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.037
We tried contacting
the security team, but no luck.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.651
[grunting]

36:00.201 --> 36:01.202
Heist team took out the SUV.
They moved in fast.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.682
Got the Tears of the Sea.

36:02.725 --> 36:05.163
I'm sure our team's
getting off island as we speak.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.209
They had Hugh Lowry charter
a plane at Kualoa Airfield.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.211
That's their escape plan.
Tennant's on the way.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.039
Copy. Lucy, let's go.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.356
I'm here.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.619
You got a visual?They're on the leeward side

36:26.662 --> 36:28.621
of the hangar. A small jet.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.405
Tail sign starts "XP124."

36:32.494 --> 36:33.495
TENNANT:
Got it.

36:33.539 --> 36:34.583
Light 'em up.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.063
Our pleasure, boss.

36:36.106 --> 36:39.414
All right, all units. All units,
let's roll. Let's roll.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.340
[siren wailing]

36:52.384 --> 36:54.386
MAN:
This is the police!
Get down on the ground

36:54.429 --> 36:56.866
with your hands on your head.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.835
[gunfire continues]

37:13.753 --> 37:16.016
So much for the
element of surprise!

37:16.059 --> 37:17.583
We're not the surprise!

37:22.762 --> 37:24.459
Ah!

37:24.503 --> 37:25.547
Henri's down.

37:25.591 --> 37:26.548
Leave him!

37:26.592 --> 37:28.594
Leave him![gunfire continues]

37:38.691 --> 37:40.562
Federal agent.
Hands where I can see them.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.880
[insects trilling]

37:55.621 --> 37:57.492
[knocks lightly]

37:57.536 --> 37:58.928
Ernie...

37:58.972 --> 38:00.365
Hey.

38:00.408 --> 38:03.803
Dude, I-I heard you were
clutch in the field today.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.413
How you feel?
[sighs]
It's like...

38:05.457 --> 38:07.415
showing up at
death's door

38:07.459 --> 38:09.330
and realizing you
didn't bring a gift.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.984
[sighs]

38:12.028 --> 38:13.639
Uh...

38:13.682 --> 38:15.945
I was... Hey, I been thinking
about this morning.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.469
Me, too.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.342
And I've changed
since then.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.779
Life's too short
to judge other people.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.651
Just need to
take care of me

38:25.694 --> 38:27.435
and let you
take care of you.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.916
Doesn't make you
any less right.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.832
I've been stubborn.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.790
So, I was...

38:34.834 --> 38:36.139
Yes, Kai.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.663
Offer still stands.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.447
You can move in with me.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.710
No, that's...

38:41.754 --> 38:43.016
That's not what I was gonna say.

38:44.670 --> 38:45.975
Oh.

38:46.019 --> 38:46.976
Yeah.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.804
It's just that, um,

38:48.848 --> 38:50.589
I plan
to put Inoki someplace

38:50.632 --> 38:52.547
until I just, I figure out
this whole apartment thing.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.462
And thank you. Thank you.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.855
I mean, it's nothing personal.

38:55.898 --> 38:58.031
Why would I take it personal?

38:59.989 --> 39:01.121
No reason.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.949
Like...

39:04.429 --> 39:05.647
I'll see you later.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.736
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.390
Yeah.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.394
Hey. You're his better half.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.830
Don't let him tell you
otherwise.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.745
[whines]

39:17.833 --> 39:19.792
[gasps] Ooh, okay, get this.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.011
Not only did Melissa
get reinstated at work,

39:22.055 --> 39:23.970
she also got a reward
from her company

39:24.013 --> 39:25.754
for helping find
that burner phone.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.843
Are you getting a cut?
No.

39:27.887 --> 39:31.194
But she invited me to her
son's birthday next month.

39:31.238 --> 39:32.761
Superman'll be there.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.023
Well, hopefully
you'll think twice

39:34.067 --> 39:35.460
before you sell yourself
short again.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.070
[chuckles] Come on.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.506
Be done with work now.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.203
I want to celebrate.
Ginza.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.988
My treat.WHISTLER: Oh.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.990
Where are
we going?

39:44.033 --> 39:45.992
Oh, you... [scoffs]
You wouldn't like it.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.647
It's too much fun and
not at all professional.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.519
You know, I got a hard out
to tuck the kids into bed.

39:51.563 --> 39:52.825
But, um, text me the details.

39:52.868 --> 39:53.869
Mm-hmm.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.003
Okay. What is your problem?

39:57.046 --> 39:58.613
Oh, I don't have one.

39:58.657 --> 39:59.875
You made it clear

39:59.919 --> 40:02.095
that we're not going
to be friends or...

40:02.138 --> 40:03.705
whatever.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.186
Means you don't get to go
to the cool bar.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.015
You know,

40:09.058 --> 40:11.626
I actually feel sorry for you.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.976
You feel sorry for me?Yeah.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.891
Because I'm amazing

40:15.935 --> 40:17.763
and you're
totally missing out.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.510
Should hold him over
for the rest of the week.

40:25.553 --> 40:26.859
And I'll be back
with some more.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.034
Or you could just
stay here, too.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.078
No, I don't need to.

40:30.515 --> 40:31.472
Uh, just...

40:31.516 --> 40:32.908
just Inoki.

40:32.952 --> 40:35.737
And I'm gonna be
at the apartment I rented,

40:35.781 --> 40:37.609
just until I find another place.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.569
Just-just let me do it
this way, okay?

40:41.613 --> 40:43.571
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll be fine.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.573
I know.

40:45.617 --> 40:47.140
You've always been
good with dogs.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.837
Dogs are easy. Yeah.

40:48.881 --> 40:51.797
You can always tell
what they need from you.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.932
I'll stop by tomorrow.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.107
We'll be here.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.769
MILIUS:So...

41:07.813 --> 41:09.597
pornography?

41:11.294 --> 41:12.861
Yes.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.994
Case closed.
Money recovered.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
Bad guys in jail.

41:16.648 --> 41:17.953
And you saved
Tears of the Sea.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.999
A win for
the island, too.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.132
You... gonna
give me a medal?

41:23.176 --> 41:25.831
No. But... brought
you some coffee.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.529
It's 8:00. It's a little late
for caffeine.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.226
Which is why
I also brought decaf,

41:30.270 --> 41:32.185
green tea,

41:32.228 --> 41:33.578
sparkling water.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.582
Is this coming
from you or Pac Fleet?

41:37.625 --> 41:39.758
Is there a right answer?

41:41.194 --> 41:43.152
Green tea, please.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.243
Thought maybe we could
drink these together.

41:49.158 --> 41:50.856
Enjoy the stars.

41:51.857 --> 41:55.556
That is literally
the last thing

41:55.600 --> 41:56.818
I expected to come
out of your mouth.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.559
[chuckles]

42:00.126 --> 42:01.997
Well, I...

42:02.041 --> 42:04.086
How about you walk me
to my car, Captain?

42:04.130 --> 42:05.523
Yes. Sure.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.829
You can, uh,
tell me about the case:

42:07.873 --> 42:10.179
clues, theory,
information, etcetera.

42:10.223 --> 42:14.009
Uh, well,
one of my people

42:14.053 --> 42:17.012
defused a bomb
in front of me today.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.579
Really?

42:18.623 --> 42:20.320
It mean, it was fake, but...

42:20.363 --> 42:22.017
still pretty cool.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.280
Wow.

42:24.324 --> 42:27.588
Today I made some game
time scheduling decisions

42:27.632 --> 42:29.024
about painting ships,
so, you know--

42:29.068 --> 42:31.070
same, same.
[laughing]
