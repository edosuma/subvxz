WEBVTT

00:13.597 --> 00:15.599
[shower running]

00:55.889 --> 00:58.016
You cook for every girl you bring home?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.769
Nah, just the ones that keep me alive.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.145
[Claire sighs]

01:04.231 --> 01:06.274
You have a job or something to get to?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.610
Or are you one of those
billionaire playboys

01:07.693 --> 01:09.945
-I'm always hearing about?
-[chuckles]

01:10.028 --> 01:11.279
No, I have a job.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.491
Damn, thought I'd lucked out.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.827
What do you do?

01:16.910 --> 01:21.373
Lawyer. I have a practice, so...
my own boss.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.126
Lawyer by day, vigilante by night.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.253
The hell does that work?

01:26.336 --> 01:29.297
[chuckles] Yeah, I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.966
[groaning]

01:34.887 --> 01:36.096
Oh, shit.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.681
You just opened
one of the cuts on your back.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.309
How do you know that?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.311
I can taste copper in the air.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.105
[laughing]

01:46.774 --> 01:48.651
"Copper in the air."

01:51.987 --> 01:53.155
May I?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.408
Knock yourself out, Houdini.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.786
[inhales sharply]

02:02.372 --> 02:03.666
[groaning]

02:08.086 --> 02:09.379
[bones shifting]

02:09.462 --> 02:11.256
[Claire moans]

02:11.339 --> 02:13.091
The swelling's down.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.721
Rib fracture's only a hairline.
I couldn't tell before.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.724
You have X-ray fingers now?

02:22.517 --> 02:25.437
I can hear your bones shift
when you breathe.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.522
No grinding means nothing's broken.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.483
What does a hairline fracture sound like?

02:34.237 --> 02:35.447
An old ship.

02:37.783 --> 02:38.784
How do you...

02:38.867 --> 02:41.161
I mean, I know that you're blind,

02:41.244 --> 02:45.082
but you... see so much.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.920
How?

02:50.879 --> 02:54.674
I guess you have to think of it
as more than just five senses.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.347
I can't see, not like everyone else,
but I can feel.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.767
Things like balance and direction.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.105
Micro-changes in air density, vibrations,

03:08.188 --> 03:11.149
blankets of temperature variations.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.154
Mix all that with what I hear,
subtle smells.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.908
All of the fragments form a sort of...

03:21.409 --> 03:23.536
impressionistic painting.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.125
Okay, but what does that look like?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.419
Like, what do you...

03:32.796 --> 03:34.506
actually see?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.511
A world on fire.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.817
If all I saw was fire,
I'd probably want to hit people, too.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.027
[chuckling]

03:55.110 --> 03:58.321
I just wish I knew
I was hitting the right ones.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.573
Claire...

04:02.534 --> 04:05.078
they know who you are now.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.579
And they're not going to stop.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.500
I'd like you to stay here, with me...

04:11.501 --> 04:13.879
just till I figure something out.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.428
That's a hell of a way
to get a girl to move in.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.305
It worked, didn't it?

04:26.850 --> 04:27.935
[Claire] Hmm.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.473
I was wondering
if you were ever gonna do that.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.227
Well, I've been a little busy.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.482
I'll get you some clothes while I'm out.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.649
[Claire] Mmm.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.908
Why don't you go to the police?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.494
With all that you have on the Russians?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.621
I wear a mask and beat on people.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.540
Doesn't exactly mesh with police policy.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.209
[sighs] You're going to end up
in another dumpster,

05:34.292 --> 05:36.794
you try to take down
the entire Russian mob yourself.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.296
Maybe I only need to take down one man.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.547
Fisk?

05:39.631 --> 05:42.592
Cut off the head of the snake,
the body dies.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.763
How do you know he's the head of the snake
if you can't find anything on him?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.140
There was a murder in a bowling alley.

05:48.223 --> 05:52.477
A man named Prohaszka.
Owned a majority in Kitchen Cabs.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.771
They were turning those over
in the garage they took me to.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.775
Right, I think Fisk hired the man
that killed Prohaszka.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.485
Everything leads back to him...

06:01.569 --> 06:03.571
but no one will talk. [clears throat]

06:03.655 --> 06:05.991
Maybe you are beating
on the wrong people.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.994
I heard a name, when they were...

06:11.038 --> 06:14.249
The prick with the baseball bat
reacted when he heard it.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.584
Like a dog when you yank his leash.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.586
What was the name?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.799
Vladimir.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.719
[speaking Russian]
It's me again. Call me back.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.887
Shithead.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.932
[knocking on door]

06:30.015 --> 06:31.266
[speaking Russian]

06:35.645 --> 06:37.189
My employer sends his regards.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.025
And his gratitude
that his offer was accepted.

06:40.108 --> 06:44.612
There are still a few small details
we'd like to iron out before...

06:46.198 --> 06:47.824
Uh, where's your brother?

06:47.907 --> 06:50.452
This is a thing I was going to ask you.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.581
Last time I saw him,
he was heading to see Mr.--

06:55.665 --> 06:57.917
-Your employer.
-[chuckling]

06:58.001 --> 07:00.712
He practically kissed me
when we agreed to terms.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.591
He have a girl or... a boy
he might be celebrating with?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.758
You try his cell?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.970
-He does not answer.
-Try again.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.556
We need to lock this down and get
distribution back to acceptable levels.

07:11.639 --> 07:12.724
[door opens]

07:18.313 --> 07:20.065
[speaking Russian]
We found him.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.784
Where?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.370
He was dumped in the lot
around the corner.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.498
[sighing]

07:45.007 --> 07:46.341
My brother.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.178
My brother.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.060
We should have returned to Moscow.
Like you wanted...

08:12.825 --> 08:14.202
[speaking English]
The man in the mask.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.538
[speaking Russian]
He sends us a message.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.374
Put every man we have on the street.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.543
Find him.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
And bring me his head.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.052
[theme music playing]

09:44.334 --> 09:47.044
Anyone else wondering about this?

09:47.129 --> 09:48.713
[chuckling]

09:50.882 --> 09:52.175
[car approaching]

10:01.226 --> 10:04.979
Why aren't we meeting in the usual place?
And what's all this?

10:05.062 --> 10:06.189
[Fisk] An opportunity...

10:08.150 --> 10:10.110
for those willing to seize it.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.112
[laughing]

10:12.195 --> 10:13.905
[speaking Mandarin]

10:18.993 --> 10:20.328
She's happy to see you.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.624
My apologies...

10:26.584 --> 10:27.960
for my absence of late.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.880
And for calling you here
on little notice.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.259
Where are the Smiley Twins?
Sleeping off another kidnapping?

10:34.342 --> 10:37.679
The Ranskahovs are no longer
a part of this organization.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.763
Since when?

10:40.348 --> 10:44.769
Since I removed Anatoly's head...
with my car door.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.521
[speaking Mandarin]

10:48.648 --> 10:50.858
She's upset they weren't consulted.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.235
[speaking Japanese]

10:53.403 --> 10:54.779
He isn't happy either.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.658
Deal me in on that.
What the hell happened?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.619
[stammers]

11:03.580 --> 11:05.915
It was a personal matter.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.001
What? That's...

11:10.962 --> 11:14.632
Vladimir isn't exactly
a hug-it-out kind of guy.

11:14.716 --> 11:19.804
The masked vigilante killed his brother.
At least that's what Vladimir believes.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.641
[Fisk] It will distract him
until preparations can be made.

11:24.684 --> 11:29.188
We all knew that we would need to
eliminate the Russians one day.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.734
They were too unpredictable.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.195
This from a guy
taking heads off with a car door.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.283
[speaking Mandarin]

11:41.033 --> 11:43.828
She wants to know
how her product is going to be moved now.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.413
[Fisk] For the moment, you would...

11:45.497 --> 11:47.790
keep sending your deliveries
to the Russians,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.209
as though nothing has changed.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.421
And when this is all over,
I'll assume their responsibility.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.966
And move their share
to your column in the ledger?

12:00.345 --> 12:03.180
A rising tide raises all boats, Leland.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.142
Profits will be divided up
equally among us.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.812
Four shares, instead of five.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.361
[speaking Mandarin]

12:25.662 --> 12:26.871
Leland?

12:28.331 --> 12:31.250
What, I'm going against the three of you?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.836
I like my head where it's at.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.590
Then we're in agreement.
Nothing changes...

12:38.550 --> 12:40.510
until I'm ready to move on Vladimir.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.138
And what if he finds out the truth
before that happens?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.768
That would be unfortunate for all of us.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.689
[scoffs]
Masked vigilantes, crazy Russians...

12:53.315 --> 12:55.525
I'm getting my stun gun out of storage.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.531
Remember your promise to me...

13:01.614 --> 13:03.658
and those I speak for.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.583
[Fisk] Madame Gao...

13:13.250 --> 13:14.919
may I walk you to your car?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.007
[speaking Mandarin]

13:22.635 --> 13:23.970
She thinks you want something.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.144
I want to put this behind us...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.398
as quickly as possible.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.823
[singing in Mandarin]

13:52.248 --> 13:53.791
[speaking Russian]
Shut up.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.128
Ask him about the man in the mask.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.756
[speaking English] Hey.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.174
Man in black mask... you know?

14:03.718 --> 14:06.012
Any of you Gao's runners know anything?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.849
I'm talking to you!

14:09.932 --> 14:11.350
Hello? [snapping fingers]

14:14.646 --> 14:17.231
[speaking Russian]
Piotr, the guy's an idiot.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.818
[Piotr] Let's go.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.620
[speaking English] Wait.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.672
[man resumes singing in Mandarin]

15:38.813 --> 15:40.565
[grunting]

15:48.239 --> 15:49.323
Huh?

15:49.406 --> 15:50.492
[gunshots]

16:19.061 --> 16:20.146
[groans]

16:24.609 --> 16:25.985
[indistinct yelling]

16:34.451 --> 16:36.078
-Where's Vladimir?
-No, please!

16:36.162 --> 16:37.288
Vladimir! Where is he?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.791
Please, I'll tell you what you want!
Just don't cut my head off!

16:39.874 --> 16:41.042
What are you talking about?

16:41.125 --> 16:44.587
Vladimir's brother.
Everyone knows you took his head.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.047
[siren blares]

16:51.343 --> 16:53.763
On the ground! On the ground!

16:53.846 --> 16:55.389
[indistinct radio chatter]

17:04.065 --> 17:05.567
Be advised two on foot.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.109
One en route to the 15th.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.280
-[copier beeps]
-No! Oh, my God.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.741
You don't make any sense!

17:16.911 --> 17:18.830
Whoa, be nice to it.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.998
You know, for when the machines take over.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.585
I can't get any of this crap
I bought to work.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.169
-Bad time to mention the phones?
-[sighs]

17:25.252 --> 17:27.630
All I hear when I try to dial
is a bunch of clicks.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.008
Could be the machines plotting,
but I don't speak computer overlord.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.010
-No, it's the rats.
-The who what now?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.471
They chewed through the main line.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.099
Phone guy's working on it now.
Exterminator's Monday.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.434
We have rats now.
I'm never sleeping here again.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.394
Then there's an upside.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.564
Hey, you guys hear
anything on the news

17:44.647 --> 17:46.065
about a Russian
getting his head cut off?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.441
In Hell's Kitchen?

17:47.524 --> 17:50.236
This city. Bad enough you get mugged,
now they chop your melon off.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.780
What's next, groping corpses?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.949
-[knocking at door]
-[woman] Excuse.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.619
Is this, um...

17:58.620 --> 18:01.038
Señor Foggy law?

18:02.456 --> 18:04.166
Bess Mahoney? Brett's mom?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.127
Sí, she refer me.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.295
[speaking Spanish]

18:08.963 --> 18:10.256
Something about cigars?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.091
You know Spanish?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.885
Oh, just what I remember from high school.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.053
Mrs. Cardenas, tell us what happened.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.475
Mi casa es rent-control.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.062
But the landlord, Señor Tully...

18:25.146 --> 18:28.524
Armand Tully?
Sleaze bag owns buildings all over town.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.027
Sí, y señor Tully...

18:31.861 --> 18:33.863
[speaking Spanish]

18:37.033 --> 18:40.286
He wants to convert
the apartments to condominiums.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.039
-And he wants them out.
-[speaking Spanish]

18:44.832 --> 18:48.252
Men came weeks ago.
They said that they were workers.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.212
[speaking Spanish]

18:50.296 --> 18:53.174
And they destroyed the apartments with a--
I don't know that last word.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.466
Sledgehammers.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.844
College.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.056
You ever have a client that
wants to chat in Punjabi, I'm your man.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.307
Um...

19:01.390 --> 19:02.684
Do you want to do this?

19:02.767 --> 19:04.686
No, no. I like listening to your voice.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.147
[sighs]

19:08.230 --> 19:09.649
Go on, Mrs. Cardenas.

19:09.732 --> 19:13.027
There is damage, en todas partes.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.486
Everywhere.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.614
[speaking Spanish]

19:17.699 --> 19:20.159
They have no working sinks or pipes.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.245
They don't have water
or electricity for days.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.457
We call policía. We speak to the officer.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.917
[speaking Spanish]

19:28.000 --> 19:31.713
-The police couldn't help.
-Policía say, "It is a city issue."

19:31.796 --> 19:33.589
[Mrs. Cardenas
continues speaking in Spanish]

19:33.673 --> 19:35.925
They don't know what to do.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.678
This says Tully offered them 10,000

19:38.761 --> 19:41.347
to give up their rent control
and vacate the premises.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.266
Maybe we can pressure him
into giving a better payout.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.477
No, Señor Foggy.

19:46.560 --> 19:51.482
We do no want money.
We want to stay in our homes.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.279
[speaking Spanish]

20:02.785 --> 20:04.286
[sighs]

20:04.370 --> 20:05.955
[speaking Spanish]

20:08.708 --> 20:09.834
[speaking Spanish]

20:12.461 --> 20:13.462
[Karen] This way, Mrs. Cardenas.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.214
I heard you say my name.
Why'd you say my name?

20:15.297 --> 20:19.176
I told her you're going to
talk to Tully's lawyer.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.804
Tully's lawyer?
Do you know who reps him?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.931
[chuckling] Yeah, I know.

20:24.015 --> 20:27.684
Landman and Zack!
Landman and mother-freakin' Zack, man!

20:27.769 --> 20:30.938
Ooh, sounds impressive.
Are they looking to hire?

20:31.022 --> 20:33.607
Oh, you wouldn't be happy.
We used to intern there.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.984
Oh, right.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.986
And they offered us a job, a great job.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.948
Which we turned down to go off
and save the world. Now they hate us.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.200
We'll need to load for bear
if we're gonna take them on.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.536
I'll hit the precinct to
check for complaints against Tully.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.371
I can't go to L and Z alone.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.917
They're gonna shark attack me, Matt.
Look at me, I'm delicious.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.376
Well, take Karen.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.881
[stammering] I mean,
yeah, if she wants to.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.215
Oh...

20:58.299 --> 20:59.633
sure.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.593
Never seen sharks feed up close before.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.304
[chuckling]

21:03.387 --> 21:05.722
Try not to splash too much.
It attracts 'em.

21:05.807 --> 21:09.060
-[laughing]
-You both are so funny.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.947
Look who it is... Murdock.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.783
Sergeant... how's your mom?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.786
Smells like a stogie. Otherwise, um...

21:28.329 --> 21:30.622
Yeah, I keep telling Foggy
not to get her cigars, but...

21:30.706 --> 21:34.085
She'd sneak 'em one way or the other.
Crafty old bird.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.253
Right, it's why I'm here.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.172
Friend of hers
has a case we're looking into.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.216
You going after Tully?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.342
Yeah, you know him?

21:41.425 --> 21:44.345
Yeah. Yeah, guy's a real scumbag.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.473
But he stays just this side of ordinance,
so there's nothing we can do.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.058
Can you pull some copies
of the complaints?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.977
Maybe get me a minute or two
with the officers who took them?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.478
You really think you and Foggy can help?

21:52.561 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, we can try.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.565
Let me see what I can find.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.984
Thank you.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.957
[overlapping chatter]

22:13.040 --> 22:16.002
[man] Now, I just want you
to tell me again how did it start.

22:17.211 --> 22:20.089
We have you at the scene
with a dead Chinese illegal, Piotr.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.465
And a backpack full of drugs.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.677
Uh-oh, that'll buy you a one-way ticket
to 30 years in Asshole Land.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.014
It'll give you some time
to touch up on those tattoos.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.473
You boys do that to yourselves

22:29.556 --> 22:31.642
or do you all get shirtless
and poke each other?

22:31.725 --> 22:33.435
Do you know who I work for?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.147
Couple of dipshit brothers
nobody gives a wank about.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.484
Bye-bye, dickhead. Enjoy your next 30.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.904
Wait.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.492
What if I give you another name?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.869
...give you another name?

22:50.953 --> 22:52.329
He'd have to be big.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.248
He'd have to be King freakin' Kong.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.544
He is.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.172
His name...

23:05.009 --> 23:06.260
is Wilson Fisk.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.636
...Wilson Fisk.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.192
-Well, what else you know about this guy?
-Not much.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.612
No one even supposed to say his name.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.950
But I will tell you everything I know...
for deal.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.702
[scoffs] "For deal."

23:40.962 --> 23:42.796
-Whose turn is it?
-Yours.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.425
I thought I took it
for that thing in the bodega?

23:46.508 --> 23:47.634
Oh, shit, yeah.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.679
All right, wait, wait.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.141
Okay, go on.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.767
-[sighs]
-Go on.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.937
Watch out! Jeez, he's going for my gun!

23:59.021 --> 24:00.231
Watch out!

24:01.023 --> 24:03.275
-[Hoffman] He's got my gun!
-[whimpering]

24:03.359 --> 24:05.486
You really shouldn't have said his name.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.612
[gunshot]

24:06.695 --> 24:08.155
[clamoring]

24:13.619 --> 24:15.162
[people shouting indistinctly]

24:17.206 --> 24:19.583
We got shots fired...

24:22.586 --> 24:23.712
[chuckles]

24:25.672 --> 24:26.757
[Karen] God!

24:28.342 --> 24:32.179
Feels like a place in a movie
where you'd buy a clone...

24:32.263 --> 24:34.098
or maybe a robot baby.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.226
-Or the clone of a robot baby.
-[laughs nervously]

24:38.352 --> 24:42.148
I'm Foggy Nelson. I called earlier.
I represent Ms. Cardenas.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.857
[woman] Foggy Bear!

24:43.940 --> 24:45.776
Look at you, still playing lawyer.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.194
What are you doing here?

24:47.278 --> 24:49.571
Working on making partner.
Marci Stahl.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.573
Uh, Karen Page.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.284
Wait, you work here, at Landman and Zack?

24:53.367 --> 24:55.827
Mmm, came on right after
you and Murdock crashed and burned.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.454
-We didn't...
-Where is your sidekick?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.290
Didn't break it off with him already,
did you?

24:59.373 --> 25:02.126
-Fog has commitment issues.
-I don't have...

25:02.209 --> 25:04.420
Matt is taking care of something.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.422
It was very nice to see you.
We have an appointment.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.424
I know. It's with me.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.802
You're Armand Tully's lawyer?

25:11.885 --> 25:15.347
Just part of the team.
They're all tied up with real work, so...

25:15.431 --> 25:17.683
All right, let's go upstairs and--

25:17.766 --> 25:20.561
Oh, we'd be finished
before the elevator stopped.

25:20.644 --> 25:24.315
Your client can agree to a buyout
or live in squalor till she's evicted.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.860
Those workmen acted illegally.
They busted the place up.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.113
They were making requested repairs.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.698
-Which they never finished.
-Yeah.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.033
-And did Mrs. Carnitas tell you--
-Cardenas.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.539
Did she tell you why the workmen
left before completing the repairs?

25:40.622 --> 25:43.584
-No, she just said--
-They feared for their safety.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.545
-From an old woman?
-From a criminal element.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.006
Her building is filled
with junkies and drug dealers.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.634
We're doing the city a favor
by trying to renovate.

25:52.718 --> 25:53.760
You know that's not true.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.638
Yeah, because the law's
always about the truth.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.808
Look, you know how this goes.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.727
It's her word versus my client's,

26:01.810 --> 26:04.938
and there's a whole backlog of these cases
pending throughout the city.

26:05.021 --> 26:07.274
No one is going to help her but us.

26:07.358 --> 26:11.403
If I were you,
I'd go to Mrs. Whatever today

26:11.487 --> 26:14.490
and strongly urge her to accept our offer.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.243
Marci.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.745
[sighs]

26:19.828 --> 26:23.249
Convincing my client
to agree to your terms... that's your job.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.500
And I'm not going to do it for you.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.377
See, you think there are only two options.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.671
These tenants take the payout and leave,
or leave without taking it.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.007
But given how long
they've put up with Tully's bullshit,

26:32.090 --> 26:33.967
I think you're actually afraid

26:34.050 --> 26:38.555
that Mrs. Cardenas and her neighbors
will find a way to eke by.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.724
-[scoffing]
-And short of physically

26:40.807 --> 26:43.602
and very illegally forcing tenants
from their rent-controlled homes...

26:43.685 --> 26:45.729
Armand Tully loses his condos.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.023
Your firm loses Tully.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.484
And that's very bad for business.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.445
You want me and my client to think
that you're doing us a favor,

26:53.529 --> 26:54.655
that we have no leverage.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.615
When really, we have all of it.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.660
So you're gonna see us in court...

26:59.743 --> 27:02.496
where I will absolutely dismantle you,

27:02.579 --> 27:06.124
from the top of your salon blowout
to the bottom of your overpriced pumps.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.339
You would've killed it here, Foggy Bear.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.426
You never should have left.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.512
You never should have signed on, Marce.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.348
You were really something,
back in the day.

27:21.432 --> 27:22.808
When you had a soul.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.312
Foggy Bear?

27:26.395 --> 27:28.104
We used to date.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.356
You dated that?

27:29.440 --> 27:31.900
-Yep, let's step a little faster.
-Oh, my God.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.284
[Wesley] They're taking statements
from Blake and Hoffman.

27:40.367 --> 27:43.704
Our contacts in IAB will make it go away.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.458
Had there been someone else in that room
with that Russian...

27:47.541 --> 27:49.835
There wasn't.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.212
It was our people.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.588
This time.

27:53.589 --> 27:57.718
Soon Vladimir won't have any comrades
to whisper your name to.

28:01.805 --> 28:02.973
Is there anything else?

28:04.516 --> 28:07.185
The '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.856
It's a personal favorite.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.775
Thank you, Wesley.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.823
[people speaking indistinctly]

28:25.036 --> 28:26.538
[knocking on door]

28:28.749 --> 28:30.376
[speaking Spanish]

28:41.845 --> 28:42.971
Jesus.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.398
Señor Tully...

28:53.774 --> 28:54.941
fix?

28:55.942 --> 28:57.986
No, not yet.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.032
But Karen and I,
we're going to do what we can.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.325
We are?

29:03.409 --> 29:04.493
[speaking Spanish]

29:04.576 --> 29:05.661
Why not?

29:05.744 --> 29:09.164
My dad owned a hardware store
for 12 forevers, picked up a few things.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.374
At least get the ball rolling.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.126
-And your cousin's a drywall guy, right?
-That he is.

29:13.209 --> 29:16.212
And Matt and I fished an electrician
out of the drunk tank.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.798
Owes us a favor.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.091
We're gonna talk to your neighbors, too,
okay, Mrs. Cardenas?

29:20.175 --> 29:21.677
We're gonna take care of you.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.306
[thanking fervently in Spanish]

29:30.602 --> 29:32.103
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:32.187 --> 29:34.189
[cell phone buzzing]

29:40.236 --> 29:41.405
[grunting]

29:41.488 --> 29:43.114
-[bones cracking]
-Ahhh!

29:45.909 --> 29:48.704
[Masked Man] Scream and that arm
becomes your good one.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.080
-We clear?
-[panting]

29:51.247 --> 29:52.999
You killed that Russian in interrogation.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.543
I had no choice,
he jumped my partner.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.711
[groaning]

29:55.794 --> 29:57.588
You lie to me and I hurt you.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.507
You killed him 'cause he said a name,
Wilson Fisk.

30:00.591 --> 30:01.592
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:01.675 --> 30:02.884
-[bones cracking]
-[groaning]

30:02.968 --> 30:04.386
Okay, okay!

30:06.430 --> 30:09.516
I shot him 'cause he said a name, so what?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.267
What I hear,
you like to kill Russians too.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.354
You chopped Anatoly's head off.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.564
And now I want his brother.

30:16.565 --> 30:17.774
I don't know where he is!

30:17.858 --> 30:20.110
[screaming]

30:20.193 --> 30:23.154
I swear! I swear! I swear! Please. Please.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.240
[heart beating]

30:26.700 --> 30:27.993
[groaning]

30:30.203 --> 30:31.580
How are Fisk and the Russians connected?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.123
Why did he kill Prohaszka for them?

30:34.708 --> 30:35.709
Why?

30:35.792 --> 30:37.544
You don't know?

30:37.628 --> 30:38.837
Oh, man.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.090
You really are one stupid son of a bitch,
aren't you?

30:42.173 --> 30:44.092
-[bones cracking]
-[screaming]

30:47.804 --> 30:49.431
[cell phone vibrating]

30:56.563 --> 30:58.273
-Good evening, madam.
-Hello.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.983
This way, please.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.415
I didn't know if you would show.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.999
Neither did I.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.919
I thought you didn't go in
for grand gestures.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.629
No, it isn't...

31:21.797 --> 31:23.840
I didn't want to be interrupted again.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.342
We can go somewhere else if you like.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.887
And if I just want
to walk out that door by myself?

31:29.513 --> 31:31.723
Then I would dine alone.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.267
It wouldn't be the first time.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.897
I've been lied to before... by men.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.694
Some were even decent ones...

31:43.777 --> 31:46.863
but they still felt the need
to be dishonest...

31:47.989 --> 31:50.075
about things that mattered.

31:53.369 --> 31:57.248
Do you feel that need... Wilson?

32:00.335 --> 32:02.546
I don't like to be in public.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.342
And I don't like to be questioned.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.431
But you can ask me anything, Vanessa.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.101
And I will always be honest with you.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.106
Let's start with something simple.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.319
What are we drinking?

32:28.947 --> 32:29.948
[chuckles]

32:33.619 --> 32:34.828
[Fisk] Marcel...

32:37.372 --> 32:39.666
the '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

32:56.642 --> 32:57.768
[door opens]

33:04.024 --> 33:06.359
Hey, sorry about your...

33:08.904 --> 33:11.698
Just... sorry, you know?

33:13.575 --> 33:15.577
Sergei tells me you know something.

33:16.537 --> 33:19.831
Something about the man
who took my brother from me.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.125
Yeah, uh...

33:24.711 --> 33:29.675
Look, I know this guy,
we did a stretch in Rikers.

33:29.758 --> 33:33.554
Getting by now at a chop shop
on the edge of the Kitchen.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.139
Told me an SUV came in yesterday.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.934
Black... expensive...

33:39.017 --> 33:42.478
backseat all splattered with blood and...

33:46.066 --> 33:47.526
brains.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.244
This car...
who does it belong to?

33:59.204 --> 34:01.873
Some big white guy...

34:01.957 --> 34:03.124
bald as shit.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.462
-Fisk?
-Didn't get a name, but...

34:07.546 --> 34:09.422
my boy said

34:09.505 --> 34:13.134
he heard baldy say something
about that guy in the black mask.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.096
Couldn't make it all out...

34:16.847 --> 34:20.058
but sounds like
he and this mask dude are tight.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.435
He works for Fisk.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.522
All this time,
Fisk has been playing us...

34:27.899 --> 34:29.484
planning this.

34:30.443 --> 34:34.948
[speaking Russian]
Tell the men to pull back and get ready.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.493
Guns, rifles, grenades. All of it.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.578
All?

34:39.661 --> 34:40.704
[yelling in Russian]

34:40.787 --> 34:42.581
[replying softly in Russian]

34:43.331 --> 34:46.501
[speaking English]
Turk, spread the word on the streets...

34:46.585 --> 34:50.631
1 million for whoever can tell me
where I can find Fisk...

34:50.714 --> 34:51.882
tonight.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.299
1 mil?

34:54.509 --> 34:57.596
Shit... I'm on it!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.402
[speaking Russian]
We will honor you, my brother...

35:15.697 --> 35:17.282
with the blood of war.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.494
Okay, try it now.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.584
Okay, yeah!

35:28.669 --> 35:30.336
I admit it. I'm impressed.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.049
Hot still doesn't work,
but at least it's a start.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.009
[Mrs. Cardenas speaking Spanish]

35:38.053 --> 35:40.430
You, Señor Foggy, you...

35:40.513 --> 35:42.223
You stay, we eat.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.225
-No, Mrs. Cardenas...
-You stay.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.394
There is no "no happen," okay?

35:46.477 --> 35:47.603
[speaking Spanish]

35:48.438 --> 35:51.024
-You want to eat?
-Be rude not to.

35:51.107 --> 35:54.736
Mi madre make this,
all the time in Guatemala.

35:55.654 --> 35:59.490
Now I make para ustedes, como gracias.

35:59.574 --> 36:03.078
Mrs. Cardenas, where did you make this?
You don't have any gas.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.956
I cook in apartamento downstairs.

36:06.748 --> 36:09.793
Aquí, we take care for another.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.215
[speaking Spanish]

36:15.298 --> 36:16.758
[laughing]

36:19.720 --> 36:21.888
Did she just...

36:21.972 --> 36:24.224
Did she... Is this a date?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.433
Uh...

36:27.352 --> 36:30.313
I sort of think it is, Señor Foggy.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.655
There're no numbers in this...
no contacts.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.408
It's a burner.
Like the one I use to talk to you.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.036
It was buzzing.
Did someone leave a message?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.371
Um...

36:46.454 --> 36:48.081
No, a text.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.958
What's it say?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.460
It's a list of locations.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.795
Four of them.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.090
47th and 12th. 48th and 9th.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.761
42nd and 10th. 44th and 11th.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.929
-44th and 11th?
-Yeah.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.057
Troika Restaurant.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.392
Where they were holding that boy?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.895
These addresses,
they're listing where the Russians are.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.939
-The hell did you get this?
-Cop.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.902
-I said go to the police, I didn't mean...
-Nah, he was working for Fisk.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.611
Killed a Russian for him,
right inside the precinct.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.446
Then later he gets that list of addresses.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.908
I'm betting I'll find Vladimir
at one of them.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.993
Matt, wait, just...

37:26.787 --> 37:27.913
What are you going to do?

37:28.621 --> 37:29.956
Whatever it takes.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.333
You know how that sounds, right?

37:36.337 --> 37:39.925
Um, when we were on that roof
you told that Russian...

37:41.092 --> 37:43.386
that you hurt people because you enjoy it.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.513
And you said you didn't believe that.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.598
I can't believe that.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.769
Because if I do,
that means you're not the man...

37:50.852 --> 37:51.978
that I believe you to be.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.772
I need to be the man this city needs.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.606
Hey, that's not a reason, it's an excuse.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.317
What do you want me to do, Claire?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.985
Let them tear Hell's Kitchen apart?

38:00.486 --> 38:01.947
Let them win?

38:03.031 --> 38:07.118
What you do is important...
to so many people. I get that.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.001
I just don't think I can let myself
fall in love with someone...

38:17.212 --> 38:19.589
who's so damn close
to becoming what he hates.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.592
You're right...

38:25.595 --> 38:27.222
you shouldn't.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.487
A prince?

38:42.570 --> 38:44.405
[Vanessa]
I didn't know he was one at first.

38:44.489 --> 38:48.743
He saw me at an exhibition.
I was the curator and traveling with it...

38:48.827 --> 38:50.871
and all of a sudden...

38:51.955 --> 38:55.375
this tall man in a white suit
and an ascot...

38:55.458 --> 38:57.293
An ascot? That's a bit much.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.669
That's what I was thinking.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.424
He sidles up to me...
I love that word, "sidle."

39:03.508 --> 39:05.010
[chuckles]

39:05.093 --> 39:09.472
...and he says, "You are more beautiful
than any painting here."

39:10.390 --> 39:13.434
I knew it was a line, but it worked.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.895
I slept with him.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.651
Does that shock you?

39:25.613 --> 39:30.201
You're a very attractive woman.
I assumed you've had lovers.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.494
That's not what I asked.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.996
No, it didn't shock me.

39:34.247 --> 39:35.415
Then why'd you look away?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.585
Because I wish I had said something
like that to you when we first met.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.924
I'm glad you didn't.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.684
This wine's even better than the last one.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.352
Did you pick it?

39:58.438 --> 40:00.773
I've never had it. My assistant.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.112
I said I'd be honest.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.447
You did.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.992
Wesley's more than an assistant...

40:12.868 --> 40:14.245
he's my friend.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.538
So you do have those.

40:17.123 --> 40:21.752
Yet the man says he was lonely
when he looked at my painting.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.296
My painting.

40:27.467 --> 40:28.551
Yes.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.262
Thank you.

40:33.974 --> 40:36.601
So why does a man like you feel alone?

40:37.810 --> 40:39.312
Nature of my business, I suppose.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.108
And what kind of business is that?

40:46.486 --> 40:48.529
Rebuilding this city.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.908
I want to carve something beautiful
out of its ugliness...

40:52.993 --> 40:54.702
set free its potential.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.746
You sound like an artist.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.040
I'm just a man with a dream.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.417
What do you think an artist is?

41:03.336 --> 41:04.963
Are those the only ones you have?

41:05.630 --> 41:07.715
You were wearing them last time.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.011
They were my father's.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.973
I wear them every day to remember him.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.184
Did he pass?

41:18.268 --> 41:20.020
When I was a boy.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.690
May I ask you something now?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.693
I'd say you've earned it.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.490
What kind of gun is that
you have in your purse?

41:41.582 --> 41:42.708
It's a .22.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.961
Did you think you would need that tonight?

41:47.213 --> 41:50.050
We've been sitting here talking
for hours...

41:52.010 --> 41:56.222
and you're going to insult me
like I have no idea what you really do?

41:58.183 --> 41:59.600
What I said...

42:00.976 --> 42:03.271
about what I want for this city
is the truth.

42:05.523 --> 42:10.611
But money and influence is not enough
to usher change on such a scale.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.113
Sometimes it requires force.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.284
I know you're a dangerous man.

42:17.327 --> 42:21.539
That's why I brought a gun
to a dinner date.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.667
Would you like to leave?

42:24.750 --> 42:25.793
No...

42:26.752 --> 42:28.879
I'd like a reason to stay.

42:37.388 --> 42:41.642
I've done things
that I'm not proud of, Vanessa.

42:44.437 --> 42:47.648
I've hurt people...
and I'm going to hurt more.

42:50.443 --> 42:53.696
It's impossible to avoid
for what I'm trying to do.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.075
But I take no pleasure in it...

42:58.326 --> 42:59.994
in cruelty.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.956
But this city isn't a caterpillar.

43:04.039 --> 43:07.127
It doesn't spin a cocoon
and wake up a butterfly.

43:08.043 --> 43:12.840
A city... crumbles and fades.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.888
It needs to die before it can be reborn.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.852
So I don't need the gun?

43:28.398 --> 43:29.857
No, by my side...

43:31.359 --> 43:33.819
is the safest place
that you could ever be.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.769
[inaudible]

44:17.530 --> 44:18.823
[speaking Russian] Vladimir...

44:18.906 --> 44:21.534
Turk just got a call.
We know where Fisk is.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.578
[Vladimir speaking Russian]
Tell the men...

44:23.661 --> 44:25.996
and no one touches Fisk.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.081
He is mine.

44:29.542 --> 44:32.378
...and Matt bangs his cane around
and says,

44:33.338 --> 44:35.506
-"Am I in the right room?"
-[both chuckling]

44:35.590 --> 44:38.092
-Where did you put his furniture?
-Dorm room across the hall.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.885
Oh, God!

44:39.969 --> 44:42.096
Oh, I really wish
I knew you guys back then.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.848
Much better off knowing us now.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.725
We have our own practice.

44:45.808 --> 44:48.853
I'm a hell of a lot more dashing
than I was in my awkward college days.

44:48.936 --> 44:52.565
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to need
photographic proof of that, counselor.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.528
I have dug myself another hole, haven't I?

44:57.612 --> 44:59.697
Well, it's been about five minutes.
You were due.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.699
-Yeah. Yeah, I see that.
-[chuckles]

45:02.908 --> 45:05.202
You know, there's something I gotta know.
It's killing me.

45:05.286 --> 45:09.415
No, I do not kiss on the first date.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

45:09.499 --> 45:10.833
No! No.

45:13.294 --> 45:16.714
What's the deal with the meat grinder
in the pencil skirt?

45:16.797 --> 45:18.883
No, she just...
She doesn't seem like your type.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.426
-Marci?
-Yeah.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.219
[sighing heavily]

45:22.303 --> 45:24.722
She was different back when I knew her.

45:25.681 --> 45:28.100
Or maybe she wasn't, I don't know.

45:28.183 --> 45:30.353
Matt's always getting involved
with the wrong girl,

45:30.436 --> 45:32.855
so maybe he just rubbed off on me.

45:32.938 --> 45:33.981
Huh.

45:35.190 --> 45:36.817
Matt dates a lot?

45:36.901 --> 45:37.943
Date? [scoffs]

45:38.027 --> 45:40.112
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

45:41.030 --> 45:43.115
He hasn't really been with anyone
for more than a month or two.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.034
Hmm.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.662
It's kind of sad.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.499
On the plus side,
he gets to touch a lot of pretty girls...

45:51.582 --> 45:53.167
on their faces.

45:53.250 --> 45:56.796
Um, that's, you know,
how he tells what people look like.

45:56.879 --> 45:59.256
Or at least that's
what he tells the ladies.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.717
Although, he always seems
to know which ones are hot

46:01.801 --> 46:04.304
before he puts his
grubby little mitts on them.

46:04.387 --> 46:07.723
[chuckling] It's a real gift.
He's like a sexual Rain Man.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.519
Does he know what you look like?

46:12.562 --> 46:14.397
He's got a rough idea.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.817
I only ever let him
put his hands on my face once,

46:17.900 --> 46:19.610
'cause... weird.

46:19.694 --> 46:20.695
[chuckles]

46:21.654 --> 46:23.113
Are you gonna finish that?

46:23.197 --> 46:24.365
No, no.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.788
You ever tell him what I look like?

46:30.871 --> 46:33.749
[chuckles] No,
he doesn't need me to tell him...

46:37.378 --> 46:40.798
He's probably got
a picture of you in his head.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.217
-I don't like to mess with those.
-Oh...

46:46.346 --> 46:47.722
Hey, Foggy...

46:51.559 --> 46:53.686
I want you to touch my face.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.441
Um... but I can see you, so--

46:58.524 --> 47:01.068
No, I... No, I know. I just, um...

47:02.778 --> 47:07.241
I want to know how someone
who's blind would see me.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.997
Look, you do me then, then I'll do you.

47:13.288 --> 47:14.289
[Karen chuckles]

47:15.332 --> 47:16.667
Yeah, okay.

47:30.598 --> 47:31.766
[man] Delivery. Gao.

47:32.307 --> 47:33.934
[speaking Russian]

47:46.196 --> 47:47.698
[overlapping chatter in Russian]

48:16.436 --> 48:18.228
[speaking Russian]
The men are ready at the other locations?

48:18.312 --> 48:19.564
They're waiting for the call.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.150
Make it.

48:31.241 --> 48:33.118
We expecting another delivery from Gao?

48:52.805 --> 48:54.306
You have to close your eyes.

48:54.389 --> 48:55.558
Right.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.940
Just tell me what you feel.

49:04.567 --> 49:06.026
-[exploding]
-[both scream]

49:08.696 --> 49:11.491
-Jesus, are you okay?
-[coughing]

49:11.574 --> 49:13.075
[siren wailing]

49:14.702 --> 49:16.662
-Foggy...
-[Mrs. Cardenas moaning]

49:19.832 --> 49:21.501
[speaking Spanish]

49:23.377 --> 49:25.379
-[Karen] We have to stop the bleeding.
-[exploding]

49:26.589 --> 49:28.508
What is happening?

49:31.844 --> 49:33.387
-Stay with her.
-Yeah.

49:35.765 --> 49:37.141
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

49:37.224 --> 49:38.726
See if anyone else needs help.
I'll be right back.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.060
Foggy...

49:41.771 --> 49:45.107
[explosions rumbling]

49:55.576 --> 49:57.036
Oh, my God...

49:59.914 --> 50:01.123
Wilson?

50:03.333 --> 50:05.670
Did you read about the boy...

50:05.753 --> 50:09.173
who watched his father
being pulled from their car and beaten,

50:09.256 --> 50:10.716
before the boy was taken?

50:13.969 --> 50:15.429
The men that did that...

50:16.764 --> 50:19.349
they will no longer infect this city.

50:27.900 --> 50:29.151
Good.

50:31.486 --> 50:33.488
[sirens wailing]

50:36.241 --> 50:38.035
[Fisk] We should call it a night.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.162
I need to get you home
before the roads close.

50:40.245 --> 50:41.371
Marcel?

50:43.916 --> 50:45.417
Your car is ready, sir.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.169
Yes, just one more thing...

50:53.593 --> 50:55.094
I want to give you this.

50:56.261 --> 50:58.347
Thank you for everything
you've done for me this evening.

50:59.306 --> 51:01.475
For making this call for me, especially.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.227
A pleasure as always, sir.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.666
[coughing]

51:53.152 --> 51:54.444
[Sergei] Vladimir!

51:56.030 --> 51:57.322
Vladimir!

51:59.574 --> 52:00.868
Vladimir!

52:05.831 --> 52:06.832
[speaking Russian]
We must go! Quickly.

52:10.210 --> 52:13.380
[Turk chuckling] Never liked
those borscht eatin' bastards.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.925
Paid shit for shit work.

52:17.259 --> 52:21.722
Although, Vlady did offer a cool mil
to give up your boy.

52:24.975 --> 52:28.395
You're alive...
which means you made the right decision.

52:30.355 --> 52:34.526
Your conversation with Vladimir
caused him to react predictably.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.154
My employer is grateful for that.

52:38.030 --> 52:40.574
Hey, happy to help.

52:42.659 --> 52:44.704
But why all that with plantin' the mask?

52:45.746 --> 52:48.958
Why not just blow 'em up from the start,
if that's what you were gonna do?

52:49.041 --> 52:52.252
It takes time
to arrange something like this,

52:52.336 --> 52:54.171
and help from friends.

52:55.672 --> 52:59.343
We needed to keep Vladimir off balance
until everything was in place.

52:59.426 --> 53:00.552
[chuckling]

53:01.721 --> 53:02.888
Right.

53:03.848 --> 53:06.600
Got mad respect for a smart move.

53:07.642 --> 53:10.813
You need anything else,
you know where to find me.

53:10.896 --> 53:11.981
Hmm.

53:18.570 --> 53:20.614
[coughing]

53:24.034 --> 53:26.036
[Sergei speaking Russian]
You are hurt.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.246
[Vladimir] I will live.

53:27.329 --> 53:32.209
And see Fisk and his masked dog
pay for what they did.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.336
[grunts]

53:48.058 --> 53:49.852
[groaning]

53:54.148 --> 53:55.690
-This one's for Claire.
-[siren blares]

53:59.111 --> 54:00.780
Hands in the air!

54:00.863 --> 54:02.572
[cop 1] Raise those hands!

54:02.656 --> 54:03.698
[cop 2] Don't move!
Raise 'em!

54:03.783 --> 54:05.200
Hands in the air, now!

54:06.076 --> 54:07.494
[indistinct radio chatter]

54:08.829 --> 54:11.331
[cop 1] Check the two on the ground.
Suspect is in custody.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.083
[cop 2] On the ground now,
you son of a bitch.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.210
[panting]

54:19.339 --> 54:21.341
[dramatic music playing]
