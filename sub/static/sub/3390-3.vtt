00:52.833 --> 00:54.833
Elite agents of the special force,
Hyun-jun and Sa-woo

00:55.000 --> 00:56.500
are as close as real brothers.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.733
Hyun-jun, while attending
a graduate school by orders of superiors,

01:00.333 --> 01:02.633
meets Seung-hee there
and falls in love with her.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.366
But her sudden disappearance
frustrates him.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.466
Sa-woo is introduced to Seung-hee
by his hometown friend Sang-hyun

01:10.900 --> 01:12.266
and also falls for her.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.100
Then, one day,

01:14.633 --> 01:17.066
Hyun-jun and Sa-woo are taken
by unknown men

01:17.433 --> 01:18.800
and they undergo harsh tests.

01:19.266 --> 01:21.866
After several special training sessions,
they join the NSS.

01:22.566 --> 01:24.100
On their first day at the NSS,

01:24.200 --> 01:25.533
they meet Seung-hee

01:26.100 --> 01:29.166
and find out their encounters
with Seung-hee had been planned.

01:29.366 --> 01:30.633
Although they feel offended,

01:30.900 --> 01:32.800
they fail to get rid of
their feelings for her.

01:33.566 --> 01:35.133
Hyun-jun suddenly kisses Seung-hee

01:35.400 --> 01:37.066
who coldly keeps her distance
from Hyun-jun.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.766
Since then, they quickly become close.

01:40.466 --> 01:41.600
As their first mission,

01:41.666 --> 01:43.866
they chase after Takashi, a terrorist,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.466
and while on the mission,

01:45.833 --> 01:49.000
they save the life of Myung-ho Cho,
a leading presidential candidate...

01:58.700 --> 02:00.433
EPISODE 3

02:37.100 --> 02:38.000
What's the matter?

02:44.700 --> 02:45.800
I think I've been here before.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.166
When?

02:53.366 --> 02:54.233
I don't know.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.666
Gosh.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.500
Stop fooling around and come sit here.
He'll be here soon.

03:01.966 --> 03:03.200
President Cho will be here soon.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.566
The President will be here soon.

03:07.933 --> 03:08.833
What's your name?

03:08.900 --> 03:09.733
Hyun-jun Kim.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.166
What do you want to be in the future?

03:11.233 --> 03:13.200
I'll become Superman and protect earth.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.666
They are both nuclear physicists from MIT,

03:15.833 --> 03:18.866
who own the core skill that can put
a nuclear development into practical use.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.433
I owe you a lot.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.266
What's wrong with you?

03:44.366 --> 03:45.266
Now I remember it.

03:48.566 --> 03:50.000
I've been here before.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.166
Are you okay?

03:55.766 --> 03:56.600
Yes.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.066
I think he's a little nervous.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.600
Please make yourself comfortable.

04:16.633 --> 04:17.500
Welcome.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.166
I'm Sa-woo Jin.

04:21.433 --> 04:22.366
I'm Hyun-jun Kim.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.066
It's you two

04:24.266 --> 04:25.900
who made it possible for me to be here.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.633
We were just doing our job.

04:28.866 --> 04:29.700
Please, take a seat.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.466
I heard that you aren't security guards
of the Blue House.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.333
Then, do you work
for the National Intelligence Service?

04:39.866 --> 04:42.233
Well, we work for the NSS.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.833
The NSS...

04:45.266 --> 04:48.000
I will explain it later, sir.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.866
You timid boy.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.066
You were so intimidated by the President.

05:04.733 --> 05:05.733
By the way,

05:06.266 --> 05:08.866
the President seemed like
he wasn't aware of the NSS.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.733
How is it possible?

05:16.566 --> 05:17.900
I haven't heard about it at all.

05:18.866 --> 05:19.866
That's right, sir.

05:20.233 --> 05:23.466
I also came to know
about its existence not long ago.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.866
The NSS was founded

05:27.333 --> 05:29.066
in 1976.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.166
At that time,
the Central Intelligence Agency

05:32.333 --> 05:34.966
and the Defense Security Command
handled the national security issues.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.566
However, double agents
from the CIA of the U.S. were

05:39.633 --> 05:41.833
in both agencies.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.066
They bugged and kept a watch
on the Blue House.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.600
Former President Chung-hee Park,

05:50.200 --> 05:52.366
proceeded nuclear development.
You're aware of it, right?

05:52.433 --> 05:53.366
Yes.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.233
That is why

05:55.766 --> 05:57.266
he needed an absolutely reliable agency

05:57.900 --> 06:00.866
which could escape
the vigilance of the US.

06:02.066 --> 06:05.766
This is how the NSS was established.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.933
Since then,

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
the NSS has taken the lead
in the nuclear development

06:12.500 --> 06:14.233
and taken care of Presidents' security

06:15.000 --> 06:16.233
and the national security issues

06:17.200 --> 06:20.666
in absolute secrecy
during several administrations.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.433
It was the NSS

06:23.500 --> 06:25.433
that assassinated the spy in 1996

06:25.766 --> 06:28.533
who killed Consul General Kwon-sik Choi.

06:29.566 --> 06:30.600
And in 1997,

06:31.133 --> 06:33.466
they traced the murderer
of North Korean defector Young-han Lee

06:34.200 --> 06:35.933
all the way to Dandong, China

06:36.533 --> 06:39.166
and assassinated him.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.133
I worked for the Intelligence Committee

06:42.466 --> 06:44.166
for 12 years when I was a congressman.

06:45.466 --> 06:47.866
Does it make sense that I wasn't aware

06:48.133 --> 06:49.366
of such agency at all?

06:49.933 --> 06:54.200
The NSS is a secret agency
operated under the NIS,

06:54.766 --> 06:57.500
and only very few people
are aware of the NSS

06:57.966 --> 06:59.500
even within the NIS.

07:00.266 --> 07:02.100
It's the only agency in the nation

07:02.166 --> 07:05.600
that operates a satellite

07:05.666 --> 07:07.166
rented from Russia.

07:07.666 --> 07:08.666
Of course,

07:09.133 --> 07:11.033
this is a top secret

07:11.100 --> 07:13.100
that the US and Japan are not aware of.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.766
Do you think the agency
must be maintained?

07:16.300 --> 07:17.900
I'm confident that the NSS will be

07:18.433 --> 07:20.566
the most useful agency during your tenure.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.166
How did it go?

07:43.833 --> 07:44.866
Does it mean

07:44.933 --> 07:46.166
we should disband the agency?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.566
No.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.166
Not really.

07:49.766 --> 07:51.133
I am sure

07:52.300 --> 07:54.900
he'll take some time to ponder upon it.

07:56.966 --> 07:58.033
If

07:59.200 --> 08:00.833
he asks for your advice,

08:01.900 --> 08:05.500
tell him that the NSS must be maintained.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.666
-I think--
-Your opinion

08:08.166 --> 08:10.233
doesn't count here.

09:02.900 --> 09:03.866
It's so good.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.966
Excuse me, can we have another bottle?

09:10.166 --> 09:11.500
How was the Blue House?

09:12.066 --> 09:13.066
Well...

09:14.366 --> 09:15.200
Sa-woo said

09:15.500 --> 09:18.633
you were so nervous
that you even stammered there.

09:19.900 --> 09:20.966
Is that true?

09:24.200 --> 09:27.666
Wow, even this arrogant Hyun-jun
becomes intimidated before the President.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.333
What are you doing tomorrow?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.500
If you're free, let's go somewhere.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.200
Where?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.233
Let's go to refresh.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.733
Where are we?

09:51.566 --> 09:52.733
I grew up here.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.633
You grew up in this church?

09:56.933 --> 09:58.433
No, in that orphanage.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.500
CHILDREN'S HOME

10:01.300 --> 10:02.900
You must've searched my background

10:03.300 --> 10:04.933
when you recruited me and Sa-woo.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.133
Haven't you found this?

10:06.300 --> 10:07.566
No.

10:07.933 --> 10:10.300
There was no record
before you enlisted in the special force.

10:10.766 --> 10:12.300
I found it weird

10:12.733 --> 10:14.400
when the officials rejected

10:14.566 --> 10:16.333
-my request for the rest of your records.
-I see.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.500
I heard that I came here when I was seven.

10:19.733 --> 10:21.366
I lived here until I moved
on to high school.

10:21.433 --> 10:22.633
I lived by myself

10:23.200 --> 10:24.733
when I attended high school and college.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.833
What about before you came here?

10:29.833 --> 10:31.000
I don't know. I don't remember.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.266
Actually, that's why I came here today.

10:39.533 --> 10:40.400
Father.

10:44.566 --> 10:45.566
Michael!

10:46.133 --> 10:47.133
How have you been?

10:48.033 --> 10:49.266
You haven't called me in a while.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.433
I thought you cut all the ties with me.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.166
I am sorry.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.600
I'd been busy since I started working

10:57.700 --> 10:59.033
after I was discharged from the army.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.066
Right.

11:00.133 --> 11:02.566
This is my colleague at work.

11:03.366 --> 11:05.233
Hello. I am Seung-hee Choi.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.733
She's beautiful.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.433
Will you marry her?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.100
That's what I hope for.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.066
But we've just started dating.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.866
Do you like your job?

11:20.100 --> 11:21.033
Yes.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.233
Actually,

11:23.433 --> 11:26.600
I came here to ask you something.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.033
What?

11:28.933 --> 11:31.933
I want to know how I ended up here

11:32.766 --> 11:35.600
and who my parents were.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.133
Can you tell me if you know about it?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.533
You'd never asked me about it.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.233
Why do you want to know
about it all of a sudden?

11:48.466 --> 11:50.566
I also want to know

11:51.666 --> 11:52.766
why I never wondered about it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I think I tried

11:55.400 --> 11:57.100
to erase all the memory I had

11:57.633 --> 11:59.800
before I came here.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.333
It's weird that I have no single clue.

12:02.833 --> 12:03.966
It feels like...

12:04.033 --> 12:07.033
I had amnesia
since I don't remember anything.

12:08.066 --> 12:11.066
I found it very weird
that I'd never tried to remember my past

12:11.133 --> 12:12.366
up until now.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.300
What do you think about this?

12:17.133 --> 12:18.433
Who are my parents?

12:20.633 --> 12:22.000
Please tell me what happened to me.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.466
It was a city hall worker
who brought you here,

12:39.433 --> 12:41.966
and there was no record about you at all.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.533
You just didn't say a word

12:46.933 --> 12:48.466
like an aphasic,

12:49.033 --> 12:51.166
as if you were immensely shocked.

12:52.033 --> 12:55.366
I think it took about a year

12:56.233 --> 12:59.933
for you to start adapting
to the life here.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.200
Did you find it out?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.266
What happened?

13:17.433 --> 13:19.200
He said he didn't get any record.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.700
That's strange.

13:22.500 --> 13:26.400
Both the NSS and this church
don't have your past record.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.000
Does it mean you fell from heaven?

13:39.433 --> 13:40.633
Holy Mother,

13:41.200 --> 13:44.433
will it be okay for me
to fall in love with such mysterious guy?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.333
What did she say?

13:56.366 --> 13:58.300
She said such past isn't important at all.

14:06.566 --> 14:07.833
It's me.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.333
Hyun-jun just visited me.

14:10.733 --> 14:12.600
He wanted to know about his parents

14:13.500 --> 14:15.433
and how he got here.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.833
No.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.133
He didn't seem to know about it.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.266
Okay.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.266
Come in.

14:42.766 --> 14:44.800
Did you receive the message?

14:45.500 --> 14:46.333
What message?

14:46.933 --> 14:49.033
The President wants you to come over.

14:55.766 --> 14:57.333
You've been working for the NSS

14:57.400 --> 14:59.166
since its establishment?

14:59.566 --> 15:00.433
Yes, sir.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.333
Frankly, I'm skeptical about the necessity

15:03.933 --> 15:05.266
of such organization nowadays.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.900
What do you think?

15:08.333 --> 15:09.333
Is it still necessary?

15:10.033 --> 15:13.033
That's not something I can decide.

15:14.866 --> 15:17.900
We're always ready
to carry out your orders

15:17.966 --> 15:20.266
at the risk of our lives.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.433
Besides that,

15:23.033 --> 15:25.333
we never make any political judgement.

15:27.033 --> 15:28.133
Good.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.733
Let me ask you one last question.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.766
I heard that the NSS took the initiative

15:40.866 --> 15:43.000
in nuclear development
when President Park was in office.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.433
How far did the technologies go?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.566
To my knowledge,

15:49.333 --> 15:51.966
the NSS almost completed
the nuclear weapon program.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.900
Is that true?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.933
That's what I heard.

15:58.266 --> 16:00.533
I heard that when the new military
took the government,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.733
it abandoned the nuclear weapon program
in order to gain recognition

16:05.200 --> 16:07.333
for its legitimacy from the US.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.633
Is that true?

16:09.700 --> 16:10.966
As far as I know, yes.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.433
Where is it?

16:14.466 --> 16:15.866
The technology to build nuclear weapons

16:16.400 --> 16:17.766
that was almost realized.

16:19.566 --> 16:20.733
Although it was abandoned,

16:21.033 --> 16:24.233
it didn't vanish, right?

16:25.366 --> 16:26.233
That's...

16:28.133 --> 16:30.833
beyond my jurisdiction. So I don't know.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.966
NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE

16:50.100 --> 16:51.300
Sa-woo.

16:53.066 --> 16:54.400
Secretary Park wants to see you.

16:54.466 --> 16:55.500
-Why?
-Why?

16:55.700 --> 16:57.733
I don't know, but please hurry.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.099
Did you want to see us?

17:10.599 --> 17:11.466
Yes.

17:11.866 --> 17:12.833
Hey,

17:13.233 --> 17:14.533
you guys get off-days as a reward.

17:15.766 --> 17:19.300
Gosh, I am not so sure if you deserve it.

17:19.366 --> 17:21.633
What do you mean?
We saved the President's life.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.833
Hey,

17:22.900 --> 17:25.166
it was nothing but a pure luck.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.966
It's so embarrassing
that I couldn't talk about it to others.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.866
You know heaven helps
those who help themselves.

17:31.066 --> 17:32.400
Bingo, isn't she right?

17:32.466 --> 17:33.733
She is.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.366
Gosh, you little brats.

17:35.466 --> 17:37.833
Hey, get out of here. Get out of my sight.

17:44.666 --> 17:45.666
What are you going to do?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.466
Well, I haven't really...

17:48.100 --> 17:49.466
What about you, Seung-hee?

17:50.133 --> 17:51.800
Well, I have a plan.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.800
This is a rare chance.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.400
I hope we three can go on a trip.

18:01.933 --> 18:02.933
Yes, Mother.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.933
Let's go on a trip to Japan. OK?

18:06.133 --> 18:07.233
It's okay.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.266
What?

18:15.300 --> 18:16.400
I checked it.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.033
Okay.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.766
I'll get down to it right away.

18:24.300 --> 18:27.133
Please relax and wait a while.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.400
Okay.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.800
Hello.

18:52.733 --> 18:53.866
Hello.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.233
Il-jung Kim.

19:04.133 --> 19:05.200
We're exposed!

19:05.533 --> 19:06.900
Someone infiltrated into this place!

19:07.100 --> 19:08.100
What are you talking about?

19:08.966 --> 19:10.600
They found me!

19:11.600 --> 19:12.433
What?

19:16.166 --> 19:17.000
Hey.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.166
Shao-wang, answer me.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.700
Go get the car and get ready to escape.

19:57.866 --> 19:58.766
Yes, sir.

20:42.433 --> 20:44.400
The front gate is blocked.
Let's move to the back gate.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.633
-Yes, sir.
-Let's move.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.566
I don't think I can make it.

21:09.766 --> 21:12.200
I hope Comrade Seung-ryong Hong
finishes this.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.366
I'm also being spied on around the clock.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.566
I can't even dare to contact the South...

21:18.500 --> 21:19.733
Who...

21:20.733 --> 21:21.700
Who are you?

21:22.833 --> 21:24.066
You have

21:25.900 --> 21:27.533
the Iris list.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.166
What are you talking about?

21:29.900 --> 21:31.133
I've got nothing to do with it.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.466
I found nothing here.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.733
Now we need to get rid
of Seung-ryong Hong.

22:25.366 --> 22:26.600
Hello.

22:27.833 --> 22:28.766
Yes.

22:30.533 --> 22:31.800
Hold on.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.000
Honey,

22:34.533 --> 22:35.700
it's from your company.

22:36.366 --> 22:37.500
He said it's urgent.

22:43.466 --> 22:45.866
Hello. What happened?

22:49.133 --> 22:52.833
This is Seung-ryong Hong, a member
of Guidance Bureau 131 of Workers' Party.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.866
As you know, Guidance Bureau 131

22:56.500 --> 22:59.533
is in charge of
the overall nuclear development.

23:00.066 --> 23:00.933
And Seung-ryong Hong is

23:01.466 --> 23:02.733
a leading figure

23:03.300 --> 23:04.300
in the bureau.

23:04.866 --> 23:06.066
A leading figure?

23:07.233 --> 23:08.233
Give me more detail.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.233
He's a scientist who took the lead
in the nuclear weapon development.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.166
Why did he flee from the North?

23:13.433 --> 23:15.400
All of this happened so suddenly,

23:15.733 --> 23:17.166
hence we haven't found that out yet.

23:18.666 --> 23:20.333
When and where is he heading to?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.566
He's in Ukraine now,

23:23.200 --> 23:24.833
and it seems like he'll move
to Hungary soon.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.400
Hungary?

23:27.366 --> 23:28.933
Gosh, too many monsters.

23:29.900 --> 23:30.866
Run, now!

23:31.600 --> 23:32.533
Go, go.

23:32.700 --> 23:33.733
Tae-sung!

23:33.800 --> 23:34.966
Yes, sir.

23:35.066 --> 23:36.866
Summon those on vacation now.
It's an emergency.

23:37.866 --> 23:38.900
What happened, sir?

23:39.366 --> 23:40.400
It's Code Orange.

23:40.466 --> 23:41.566
Summon them,  now .

23:46.500 --> 23:47.633
Orange?

24:04.666 --> 24:09.100
INUKIA HOTEL

24:12.900 --> 24:13.800
Wow.

24:20.433 --> 24:21.366
Thank you.

24:21.433 --> 24:22.933
Please enjoy your time here.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.033
Wow.

24:29.866 --> 24:30.833
Gosh.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.233
It's wonderful.

24:33.133 --> 24:34.966
Hyun-jun, come here.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.300
We can see the entire lake.

24:39.766 --> 24:40.700
Hyun-jun.

24:42.433 --> 24:43.333
Dear me.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.533
What are you doing?

24:46.566 --> 24:48.100
I'm so tired.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.466
I want to have a deep sleep.

24:51.766 --> 24:52.900
Then, let's have a bath first.

24:56.733 --> 24:57.666
What?

24:58.633 --> 24:59.600
Together?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.500
What are you thinking?

25:03.233 --> 25:04.500
You pervert.

25:08.733 --> 25:10.033
Get up.

25:32.700 --> 25:33.633
Hello.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.333
I heard that there is a famous
hot spring around here.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.266
Do you know where it is?

25:40.733 --> 25:43.500
If you go straight,
you'll see it on your left.

25:44.133 --> 25:45.033
Thank you.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.666
He's handsome.

26:02.633 --> 26:03.466
Let's go.

26:17.066 --> 26:18.300
Look at the snow.

26:18.366 --> 26:19.700
It's exactly what I had imagined.

26:20.700 --> 26:21.900
Very nice.

26:22.533 --> 26:25.133
I'm so tired. I'll enjoy hot bath
all day long.

26:28.666 --> 26:30.566
Welcome. Please come in.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.300
Thank you.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.733
What happened, sir?

26:54.633 --> 26:56.766
You should fly to Hungary right away.

26:57.933 --> 26:59.366
By myself?

26:59.700 --> 27:01.333
Hyun-jun and Seung-hee must go with you,

27:01.400 --> 27:02.800
but I can't reach them now.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.300
Both of them?

27:04.366 --> 27:06.100
I'll send them as soon as I reach them.

27:06.533 --> 27:07.533
You should depart now.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.666
We'll issue the command
when you get there.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.133
Meet me here when you finish.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.500
Okay. See you.

27:25.566 --> 27:26.533
Okay.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.633
MEN WOMEN

27:32.700 --> 27:35.033
MEN

27:36.433 --> 27:38.800
CONTACT FRONT DESK FOR A PRIVATE POOL

27:38.966 --> 27:40.400
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

27:42.633 --> 27:43.600
Sorry!

27:43.666 --> 27:45.400
I saw nothing.

27:45.466 --> 27:46.666
What was that?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.733
But I did use the right exit.

27:50.933 --> 27:51.766
WOMEN

27:51.866 --> 27:53.233
I got it right, too.

27:54.766 --> 27:56.066
You must be confused.

27:56.166 --> 27:57.866
No, I got it right.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.433
Are you not going in?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.266
I will.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.166
What about you?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.700
You said you'll enjoy hot bath all day.

29:02.966 --> 29:04.500
You're tired, aren't you?

29:06.800 --> 29:07.966
Didn't I tell you?

29:08.033 --> 29:10.400
I heard that foot bath is

29:10.966 --> 29:12.700
much healthier.

29:12.766 --> 29:13.833
Dear me.

29:14.866 --> 29:15.933
Gosh.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.000
Be a man.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.566
It's not...

29:21.466 --> 29:22.666
I'll go in first, then.

29:23.366 --> 29:24.366
Okay.

29:32.966 --> 29:33.900
Gosh.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.366
It's that girl we just met.

29:38.566 --> 29:39.666
Thank you for waiting.

29:40.833 --> 29:41.666
What is your name?

29:42.400 --> 29:43.333
I'm Yuki.

29:43.533 --> 29:44.366
Thank you.

29:45.433 --> 29:46.333
Thanks, Yuki.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.033
Have a good time.

29:55.233 --> 29:56.100
You want some sake?

29:56.633 --> 29:57.533
Good.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.400
Tae-sung.

30:18.266 --> 30:19.900
Did Hyun-jun and Seung-hee
pick up the phone?

30:20.433 --> 30:21.600
I'm still trying to reach them.

30:21.666 --> 30:23.400
Is that all you can do now?

30:24.533 --> 30:25.966
Send an agent and bring them back!

30:27.100 --> 30:27.966
Yes, sir.

30:38.533 --> 30:39.533
Wow.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.666
This is a snowy country.

30:42.433 --> 30:45.800
I feel like I'm inside a novel
of Yasunari Kawabata.

30:47.266 --> 30:49.166
I'm so fed up with snow.

30:49.733 --> 30:50.966
I had to march about 400km

30:51.966 --> 30:54.200
along the snowy roads
when I was in the force.

30:54.766 --> 30:56.900
It was awful.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.500
You just spoiled the mood.

31:12.533 --> 31:13.533
Ouch!

31:15.466 --> 31:16.766
You're so dead.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.966
By the way,

31:32.066 --> 31:33.466
I have a question.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.200
What is it?

31:37.333 --> 31:38.300
Why did you

31:38.933 --> 31:40.833
kiss me all of a sudden that night?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.333
Was it defiance against me

31:45.933 --> 31:46.933
or love?

31:50.833 --> 31:53.633
I didn't mean to kiss you.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.866
When I saw you

31:58.100 --> 32:00.566
bombarding rough words
with your pretty lips,

32:01.266 --> 32:03.933
I just wanted to stop it.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.200
Then, I'll have to keep using
such rough words.

32:41.166 --> 32:42.166
Stop!

33:25.800 --> 33:27.200
I'm Sa-woo Jin from Korea.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.133
Let's get out.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.633
This way.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.900
Right. I need to buy something. Wait here.

36:06.466 --> 36:07.433
Just a second.

36:15.866 --> 36:16.733
PUB

36:28.300 --> 36:31.033
In memory of Hyun-jun and Seung-hee's trip

36:32.866 --> 36:34.633
You're so childish.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.666
I love being childish.

37:00.566 --> 37:01.500
What?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.200
Why?

37:08.733 --> 37:09.766
What do you want?

37:11.100 --> 37:13.066
Stop beating around the bush
and give it to me.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.700
Isn't that for me?

37:16.466 --> 37:17.366
This one?

37:19.866 --> 37:21.666
There's no need to be shy.

37:26.700 --> 37:27.666
Did you...

37:27.733 --> 37:29.333
Did you also forget
to bring your underwear?

37:31.866 --> 37:33.066
It's for men.

37:33.633 --> 37:34.666
Do you still want it?

37:38.166 --> 37:39.366
You can wear it if you want.

37:52.566 --> 37:53.466
Gosh.

38:00.166 --> 38:01.266
Did you expect

38:02.233 --> 38:03.566
candies as a White Day's gift?

38:07.566 --> 38:10.000
This is unbelievable.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.166
Is it funny to you?

38:13.633 --> 38:15.366
What's wrong with you? That's so childish.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.266
I said I like being childish, didn't I?

38:21.666 --> 38:22.666
Are you serious?

38:25.933 --> 38:26.866
Really?

38:31.233 --> 38:32.966
Gosh.

38:33.066 --> 38:34.033
You're driving me crazy.

39:08.366 --> 39:14.366
PUB

39:41.133 --> 39:42.200
You got nothing for me?

40:06.366 --> 40:07.600
Are you happy now?

40:11.666 --> 40:12.766
My goodness...

41:19.500 --> 41:21.166
I'll sleep on this side.

41:21.700 --> 41:22.766
It's uncomfortable there.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.266
Can you pass me my pillow?

41:26.666 --> 41:28.366
Why are you staring at me?

41:34.366 --> 41:35.266
Here it is.

41:35.933 --> 41:36.800
Thanks.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.266
I think...

41:48.333 --> 41:49.333
What are you laughing at?

41:51.433 --> 41:52.433
Why?

41:52.500 --> 41:53.666
Why are you laughing?

43:13.766 --> 43:14.800
I'm hungry.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.833
Good morning.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.100
I'm starving.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.400
It looks good.

43:44.566 --> 43:45.700
When did you learn this?

43:45.800 --> 43:46.966
I do this all the time.

43:51.233 --> 43:52.300
You've changed.

43:53.166 --> 43:54.133
Shut it.

44:05.433 --> 44:06.666
Do I look that pretty?

44:06.733 --> 44:08.166
Just eat up.

44:12.866 --> 44:14.333
I've never seen you all flushed like now.

46:22.966 --> 46:23.866
Ma'am,

46:26.333 --> 46:27.466
hurry to the meeting room.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.333
Yes.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.033
Yes, they just got here.

46:40.800 --> 46:41.666
Okay.

46:44.666 --> 46:46.500
What happened to you?

46:46.900 --> 46:48.000
You know

46:48.433 --> 46:50.133
you must always remain in touch
for emergency!

46:50.766 --> 46:51.666
I'm sorry, sir.

46:53.633 --> 46:54.800
Did you hear about your mission?

46:54.866 --> 46:55.833
Not yet, sir.

46:59.700 --> 47:00.900
These are tickets for Hungary.

47:01.666 --> 47:02.666
Depart now.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.666
He's Seung-ryong Hong.

47:07.500 --> 47:10.300
He's in charge of the nuclear development
strategies of the North.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.300
He asked for political asylum.

47:14.733 --> 47:16.333
Where is he now?

47:16.866 --> 47:17.900
He's in Hungary.

47:18.833 --> 47:21.566
He's under our agent's protection now.

47:21.933 --> 47:24.200
Why did such key figure ask for asylum?

47:24.800 --> 47:28.300
Don't we have to be suspicious
of his intention first?

47:28.633 --> 47:29.566
Besides,

47:30.000 --> 47:31.366
we are at such a sensitive time

47:31.933 --> 47:33.600
to grant him asylum.

47:34.566 --> 47:35.733
We need to take

47:35.966 --> 47:39.700
cautious approaches not to cause
any unnecessary misunderstanding

47:40.466 --> 47:42.166
or troubles among the parties.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.766
I want to hear your opinion.

47:45.700 --> 47:48.766
We've sent agents to the scene
to analyze the credibility

47:50.200 --> 47:52.166
of his request for asylum.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.966
I think you need to make a decision

47:54.366 --> 47:55.766
after the result comes out.

48:03.633 --> 48:05.400
BALATON STATION

48:17.933 --> 48:19.966
Confess the truth to me.

48:21.933 --> 48:23.800
Or you'll be dead.

48:25.666 --> 48:27.000
Where did you go on vacation?

48:30.966 --> 48:31.866
Japan.

48:33.066 --> 48:34.033
Akita.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.200
Who accompanied you?

48:43.800 --> 48:44.733
Do you have a death wish?

48:49.366 --> 48:50.300
It was Seung-hee.

48:54.100 --> 48:55.100
Was it good?

48:57.333 --> 48:58.433
It was fantastic.

49:00.433 --> 49:01.833
You bastard.

49:02.500 --> 49:05.300
You said you met the love of your life

49:05.366 --> 49:07.000
at the graduate school.

49:07.700 --> 49:08.833
That's Seung-hee.

49:12.266 --> 49:14.466
You're the only one that knows about this.
So keep it secret.

49:15.133 --> 49:16.566
I'll hold my lips tight,

49:17.566 --> 49:19.233
but office romances are never easy.

49:20.100 --> 49:21.166
That's why

49:22.900 --> 49:24.800
I'm planning to make her move in
after this mission.

49:28.400 --> 49:29.333
You're going to marry her?

49:29.400 --> 49:30.466
Yes.

49:35.033 --> 49:36.033
Sa-woo!

49:39.433 --> 49:40.333
Oh...

50:01.533 --> 50:02.766
Please leave us alone.

50:22.100 --> 50:23.466
You made a difficult decision.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.000
Still,

50:27.866 --> 50:29.966
I need to know exactly what your intention

50:30.800 --> 50:33.333
behind your request for asylum is.

50:34.700 --> 50:36.400
I might have to ask you rude questions.

50:36.900 --> 50:37.933
I hope you understand.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.133
You went to Jaeil Middle and High School,

50:44.733 --> 50:46.866
and majored in nuclear physics
in Kimilsung University.

50:46.966 --> 50:48.833
You even obtained a doctorate
from LMU in Germany.

50:49.933 --> 50:51.533
You must've been a powerful elite.

50:56.300 --> 50:57.766
Is the watch you're wearing

50:58.733 --> 51:00.133
about 20 years old?

51:05.800 --> 51:08.400
You are a single-minded man,
who dislike changes and adventures.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.600
In other words,

51:10.366 --> 51:13.400
you rarely react to external stimuli
and have a strong sense of loyalty.

51:15.433 --> 51:18.066
You tend to remain complacent
with your position within an organization.

51:20.466 --> 51:23.966
I'm sure the party had
high hopes for you...

51:27.900 --> 51:29.233
because you were a core member

51:29.633 --> 51:31.100
of Guidance Bureau 131.

51:49.733 --> 51:51.700
I've heard you have a great affection
for your daughter

51:52.066 --> 51:53.833
as she's not only a late,
but also an only child.

51:55.366 --> 51:58.100
You're well aware that your future hangs

51:59.600 --> 52:00.933
on your decision, right?

52:22.400 --> 52:23.366
Okay.

52:25.533 --> 52:26.500
I got it.

52:31.333 --> 52:32.833
The analysis is done.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.300
I guess you have difficulties
in making a decision.

52:38.766 --> 52:39.766
Well...

52:40.600 --> 52:42.933
I'm sure it will cause political tension.

52:47.900 --> 52:49.266
What do you think?

52:50.800 --> 52:52.266
Do you think

52:52.900 --> 52:54.366
I can go with you?

52:55.800 --> 52:58.600
I'm sorry, but we're not in a position
to make a judgement.

53:03.366 --> 53:05.566
What decision do you think he'll make?

53:06.100 --> 53:07.366
Wouldn't he decline the request?

53:09.966 --> 53:11.533
Politics isn't that simple,

53:11.933 --> 53:13.433
is it?

53:16.100 --> 53:17.166
Deputy Director Baek.

53:20.733 --> 53:22.733
President Cho wants to see you.

53:44.466 --> 53:46.133
I will grant him asylum.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.666
It'll bring about a huge political impact.

53:51.066 --> 53:52.166
I'm aware of it.

53:52.500 --> 53:55.600
But I really want to meet
with Seung-ryong Hong.

53:56.833 --> 53:59.033
I'm very interested
in nuclear weapon program.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.433
I want to revive
the nuclear development technology

54:04.200 --> 54:06.333
that we stopped working on.

54:20.866 --> 54:22.000
Is everything okay?

54:22.800 --> 54:23.633
Yes.

54:24.133 --> 54:26.533
It's so awkward.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.600
Why do they take so long
to make the decision?

54:38.633 --> 54:39.700
I heard

54:40.266 --> 54:41.733
that you went on a trip to Japan.

54:44.733 --> 54:45.866
Did Hyun-jun tell you?

54:47.566 --> 54:48.400
Yes.

54:48.566 --> 54:51.400
How can an agent fail
to keep his mouth shut that easily?

54:53.466 --> 54:54.500
Hyun-jun said

54:55.500 --> 54:57.966
he'll marry you.

54:58.900 --> 55:01.733
You know we can't get married now.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.633
He's gotten carried away again.

55:09.633 --> 55:10.500
Then,

55:11.933 --> 55:13.100
are you going to marry him

55:14.266 --> 55:15.966
someday anyway?

55:21.066 --> 55:22.200
Well...

55:23.700 --> 55:25.633
Making plans for the future is

55:26.333 --> 55:29.133
pretty useless for agents like us.

55:31.333 --> 55:32.500
Still,

55:33.000 --> 55:34.300
I want to get married in good time.

55:45.366 --> 55:46.800
I know Hyun-jun

55:47.466 --> 55:49.866
very well.

55:50.533 --> 55:52.233
He's nothing but a weirdo.

55:53.666 --> 55:54.833
You must be prudent.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.633
I know.

55:57.366 --> 55:58.300
But

55:58.933 --> 56:00.966
I'm an expert in fixing weirdos.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.100
Are you religious?

56:13.033 --> 56:13.966
No, I'm not.

56:18.666 --> 56:19.666
I see.

56:22.466 --> 56:23.633
I am.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.300
It's paradoxical that I,
who's from the North, believe in God

56:27.766 --> 56:32.066
but you, from the South, don't.

56:33.900 --> 56:35.166
There's an old saying.

56:38.100 --> 56:39.500
"Live your life

56:39.966 --> 56:42.466
as if there is God.

56:43.466 --> 56:45.200
If God exists,

56:46.066 --> 56:48.366
you gain all.

56:50.100 --> 56:51.900
If God doesn't exist,

56:52.533 --> 56:55.233
you lose nothing."

57:04.333 --> 57:05.300
Please take this.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.733
You'll lose nothing anyway.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.766
The decision is made.

57:24.066 --> 57:25.300
We'll take you.

57:53.200 --> 57:54.300
What is that?

58:09.333 --> 58:10.200
What the heck is that?

58:16.800 --> 58:17.700
Watch out.

58:29.600 --> 58:30.500
What was that?

58:31.266 --> 58:32.166
What the...

59:26.400 --> 59:28.566
Why did they choose this place?
It's such an open place.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.833
Hungary is at the very center of Europe.

59:32.966 --> 59:34.566
We can fly anywhere from here.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.400
We can go to Swiss, Paris

59:38.400 --> 59:39.400
and even Frankfurt.

59:42.133 --> 59:43.200
Hello.

59:50.100 --> 59:51.266
Please have a safe trip.

1:01:46.033 --> 1:01:47.700
Who are you?

1:01:51.133 --> 1:01:52.400
What?

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.033
You know what I want.

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:56.533
Give it to me.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:58.866
Why are you doing this to me?

1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:00.666
What are you asking for?

1:02:03.566 --> 1:02:04.766
There's an old saying.

1:02:06.333 --> 1:02:07.766
"Live your life

1:02:08.166 --> 1:02:10.500
as if there's God.

1:02:14.166 --> 1:02:15.733
If God exists,

1:02:17.333 --> 1:02:19.466
you gain all."

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:28.900
What is that?

1:02:30.366 --> 1:02:31.266
Nothing.

1:03:12.466 --> 1:03:13.333
You have

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:14.800
a solo mission.

1:03:15.866 --> 1:03:18.433
Now, the guard level is upgraded
to the first level.

1:03:26.233 --> 1:03:29.566
K1 got injured in action.

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:31.766
Please tell me.

1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:34.600
He's an Asian in his thirties.

1:03:34.766 --> 1:03:36.466
Request an urgent investigation
to the police.
