00:45.379 --> 00:48.379
Move, move, move.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.740
Tell me again why we chose this
over seeing the movie.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.378
If these guys lose focus
for even a millisecond...

01:19.379 --> 01:22.081
...you have to scrape them off the fence
with a shovel.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.783
You come hoping to see a crash?

01:23.784 --> 01:26.784
No, I would like to see them complete--
Of course it's to see a crash.

01:27.487 --> 01:30.487
-You're sick, Hunt.
-Come on!

01:37.764 --> 01:40.499
Look, here comes Nick with our stuff.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.801
-Hey, bud.
-There he is.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.803
Yes.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.804
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.175
Oh, my God. Ha, ha.

01:50.577 --> 01:53.577
-Uh, time to lay off the Funyuns, Nicky boy.
-Oh, thanks, buddy.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.816
- Ah, great.
- Yeah! All right!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.619
-Oh, my God.
-Oh. Here. Want a drink?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.620
-Oh. Is that straight-up Jack?
-It's his buddy Jim.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.025
- Maybe later, yeah?
- Hey, sport.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.793
Can my girl use your binoculars?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.794
Well, they're not really binoculars exactly.
They're more--

02:14.034 --> 02:17.034
Drink as much as you like.

02:19.039 --> 02:22.039
Go, go, go.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.978
Whoa. Easy, fellas.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.979
Craig Perry shuts the door
as Mark Helfrich tries to overtake him.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.219
Hey, thanks for making me
take a study break.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.220
I really, really needed this.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.826
Excuse me. Pardon me.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.901
That was a close call..

02:51.405 --> 02:53.739
Well, great. What did I just miss?

02:53.740 --> 02:56.740
-Can you see, ma'am?
-I'm sorry, not really.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.077
-Would you like me to move down a bit?
-Would you mind?

03:00.347 --> 03:01.681
-Be glad to.
-Thanks, man.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.682
-Thank you.
-And I thought chivalry was dead.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.851
Heh. That's not true.
I have my cowboy right here.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.922
Get a room, guys.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.598
Hey. Put these in.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.934
-Oh, Mom, not tampons.
-Put these-- Put them in.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.935
Nick. Nick.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.773
- This tickles.
- Aw, Mom.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.743
- No, no, no.
- She put tampons in their ears.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.078
That's just wrong, man.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.580
I can't see now.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.515
Hey, down in front, asshole.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.516
Approaching the halfway point.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.792
There goes the neighborhood.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.364
Sir.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.365
I need you to move your foot. Thank you.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.149
Hey, how old is this place?

04:10.150 --> 04:13.150
You got me.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.320
- Come on, let's go.
- Go, go, go.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.089
Tire up.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.091
What's that?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.295
Is it safe to sit here?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.296
Of course. There's a fence there.
We're fine.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.299
Relax.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.205
Replay of the
Camping World Regional Series race...

05:08.275 --> 05:11.275
...is on the Replay Race Channel
at 3p.m.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.711
Did you feel that?

05:45.712 --> 05:47.913
Just now, right here.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.415
You okay?

05:49.416 --> 05:52.416
Uh, I felt something touch me.
Something strange.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.087
For those of you
with a business-minded head...

05:58.758 --> 06:01.758
Go, go.

06:02.329 --> 06:05.329
Come on, come on, come on.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.903
- Two's good.
- Go, go, go.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.939
No, no, no, wait! The screwdriver! Shit!

06:50.310 --> 06:53.310
Oh.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.485
Come on, come on. Let's go, go, go!

07:02.656 --> 07:05.656
Come on.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.163
Move!

07:19.839 --> 07:22.839
Go. Get the fuck out of here.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.646
- Come on.
- Boys, wait!

07:27.647 --> 07:30.647
Come on, Mom.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.019
Mom!

07:50.971 --> 07:53.872
Hey! Hey! There's an exit this way!

07:53.873 --> 07:56.873
Come on, move.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.391
-Hunt!
-Janet!

08:14.894 --> 08:17.894
- Let's move. Come on.
- There's an exit over here. Come on.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.868
Come on, come on! This way! Run!

08:22.869 --> 08:24.136
- Lori!
- Move!

08:33.145 --> 08:35.414
Lori. Lori, come on, let's go!
Get out of here!

08:35.414 --> 08:38.414
Move! Push through!

08:42.756 --> 08:45.756
Come on!

08:52.899 --> 08:55.899
Ow. Hey. What the hell?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.504
Are you okay?

08:58.505 --> 09:01.505
Nick, is there something wrong?

09:01.908 --> 09:04.109
Oh, my God, is that straight-up Jack?

09:04.110 --> 09:07.110
-No, no, it's his--
-His buddy Jim.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.247
You have been in my stash. You snake.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.619
A cowboy in a hat. He sits here.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.388
Excuse me. Pardon me.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.357
Oh, ha, ha.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.226
Cowboy.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.096
Tampons. She gets tampons.
She puts them in her kids' ears.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.131
-Who?
-Her, right there.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.567
Hey. Put these in your ears.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.303
- Oh, Mom, not tampons.
- Put them in your ear.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.472
Hey, how did you know
she was gonna do that?

09:33.473 --> 09:36.308
That's a lot of tampons for one woman.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.309
Nick? Nick. What's going on?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.415
"Down" something. "Down...
Down in-- Down in front, asshole."

09:45.919 --> 09:48.919
Down in front, asshole.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.157
There goes the neighborhood.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.894
Sir. I need you to move your foot.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.267
Thank you.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.069
- Let's go.
- Move it.

10:04.070 --> 10:07.070
Go. Pick up the tire.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.475
That's the car that's gonna crash.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.510
-We have to get out of here.
-Thank God.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.246
-What? No, no. I got $500 on this race.
-No one cares--

10:14.247 --> 10:17.247
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
We're gonna die. There's gonna be a crash.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.619
Hey, kid, that ain't funny.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.188
-We gotta go right now. We gotta move.
-Relax, Nick.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.189
- Nick, calm down.
- Oh, my God.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.993
What's your problem, bro?
Get off of me, man.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.198
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait. Boys, wait!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.468
I'm gonna kick your little ass, you pussy!

10:39.038 --> 10:41.206
Goddamn it!

10:41.207 --> 10:42.975
God, you little punk.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.976
-Andy.
-Stay there.

10:49.716 --> 10:52.716
- Come back here, kid!
- Hey, you little prick!

10:52.719 --> 10:55.154
- Are you out of your mind?
- I saw the whole thing.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.689
-There's gonna be a crash.
-Of course there's a crash.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.057
There's always a fucking crash.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What crash?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.564
That fucking crash.
That's what crash I'm talking about.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.567
Are you shitting me? That's the reason
I come to these stupid redneck things.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.038
No offense.

11:13.039 --> 11:16.039
-Sir. No, no, no--
-But my wife's in there, asshole!

11:16.409 --> 11:18.744
- No, you can't.
- Let me go! I gotta find her!

11:18.745 --> 11:20.913
- Dude, relax.
- That's my wife!

11:20.914 --> 11:22.748
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

11:22.749 --> 11:25.749
Have you all lost your fucking mind?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.921
Ew!

13:06.519 --> 13:09.121
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.492
-Just a second.
-That's okay.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.342
Nick, was it like a dream
or like a voice in your head?

13:33.179 --> 13:36.179
I just... I just saw it.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.883
-Can we just try to forget about it?
-Are you kidding?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.121
I am never gonna get that image
out of my head.

13:43.122 --> 13:46.122
-I mean, that girl's face just--
-Janet. Look, I know it's difficult.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.859
-We're all a little freaked out, okay?
-But why are we still alive?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.998
Who cares why? Okay?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.999
If we made it, we deserved it.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.404
Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin shit
a rest, please?

14:03.309 --> 14:06.309
Guys, look.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.722
- l think we should go to the memorial.
- I can't.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.026
-l can't go back.
-Yeah, screw that.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.428
We can pay our respects to those people.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.996
What people?

14:24.997 --> 14:27.997
People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with
them to tell them to get out of the way?

14:28.901 --> 14:31.901
People who didn't have one of these?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.374
Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.375
It's your choice, heads or tails,
but you know I like head.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.745
-Can't believe I ever went out with you.
-Can't believe you were so lucky.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.516
Guys, look. We're here.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.453
All right?
Something gave us a second chance...

14:50.790 --> 14:53.790
...so let's be thankful
and just try to make the most of it.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.727
Okay?

15:33.666 --> 15:36.666
Come on, let's go.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.449
-You okay?
-Yeah.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.184
Okay.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.019
Hi.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.121
Hi, I was hoping you'd come.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.122
I wanted to thank you. You're a hero.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.692
Because of your warning,
we're alive and our two sons are safe.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.995
Look, I'm not a hero, okay? I-- I didn't--

16:07.500 --> 16:09.534
You knew.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.535
How did you know it was gonna happen?

16:13.372 --> 16:16.372
- I'm not sure.
- Look, we're just glad you all are okay.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.711
Take care.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.380
Thank you.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.616
I'm glad you're safe.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.617
Thank you.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.122
Excuse me.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.123
I'm, uh, the security guard. George.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.994
Nick.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.195
Lori.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.830
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.666
I was pretty freaked out about that
back there.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.667
-l just wanted to ask you how you--
-You killed my wife.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.241
I wanted to go in there after her, but...

16:52.745 --> 16:54.579
...you, uh...

16:54.580 --> 16:57.580
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.486
Well...

17:01.487 --> 17:03.855
...nobody lives forever, nigger.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.856
-Hey, there's no need for that, man.
-Back off, you fucking freak.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.194
It's time for you to leave, sir.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.565
Time?

17:16.935 --> 17:19.935
Your time's coming, chocolate.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.076
What's wrong?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.811
I just had a really bad nightmare.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.281
It's okay, it's just a dream.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.282
It seemed real.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.119
Just try to relax and go back to sleep.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.489
I'm right here.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.268
Son of a bitch.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.974
Hey, Ma. It's late.
What are you doing up?

19:06.178 --> 19:08.713
Okay.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.714
No, no, no, everything's fine.
Yeah, it's fine.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.855
Okay.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.041
Time's up.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.012
Goddamn it.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.295
I'll burn you.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.465
she probably wasn't...

21:00.993 --> 21:03.661
No, no, no! Fuck!

21:08.634 --> 21:11.634
Help me! Help!
Wake up, please, anybody!

21:12.004 --> 21:14.506
Please, I'm on fire! It's burning!

21:18.177 --> 21:21.177
Oh, my God.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.793
My ass is on fire! My ass is on fire!

21:35.995 --> 21:37.495
My God! My ass is on fire!

21:37.496 --> 21:40.298
-Hey, babe, what's up?
-Hey, Lori. Turn on Channel 7 right now.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.536
You remember that redneck
from the racetrack?

21:44.537 --> 21:47.537
-He's dead.
-What?

21:47.606 --> 21:49.440
Yeah, hold on.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.209
--from the freak accident.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.210
Although the investigation
is still ongoing...

21:54.280 --> 21:56.481
...paramedics pronounced Daniels dead
on the scene.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.715
Nick, get in here.

21:57.716 --> 22:00.051
A member of local PTA and NRA chapters...

22:00.052 --> 22:02.720
...Carter Daniels lived quietly
in Fort Wayne.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.223
Details are sketchy
on how Daniels was killed.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.224
All that is known at this time
is that a tow truck dragged him...

22:08.394 --> 22:10.995
...down a residential street
before the truck exploded.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.996
- Wanna hear something freaky?
- Carter's wife was killed...

22:13.999 --> 22:16.201
I've seen that door before.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.736
More to come on our nightly news.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.737
And now we'll checkin
with our eye in the sky...

22:31.851 --> 22:34.385
Hey, hey, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

22:34.386 --> 22:37.386
Okay, bye.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.826
What is it? What's wrong?

22:41.827 --> 22:44.827
Remember that dream I had last night?

22:46.398 --> 22:49.398
I-- I don't think it was a dream.
It was like...

22:50.769 --> 22:53.769
It was like a vision.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.106
I mean, there were flames,
and there was a hook...

22:57.943 --> 23:00.943
...and that red door.

23:01.447 --> 23:04.447
And now that racist guy is dead.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.017
It was like I saw clues
as to how he was gonna die.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.625
Just now I saw another one.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.626
Wait, wait, you saw how another person
was gonna die?

23:17.196 --> 23:19.797
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.798
It doesn't make any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.801
Ever since I left the racetrack, I feel
like there's something in the room with me.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.876
What is happening to me?

23:36.248 --> 23:39.248
- You're early today.
- Oh, yeah, light load.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.662
Hey, look. Come here.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.433
-Bet you can't hit that sign with a rock.
-Okay.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.434
[BOTH GRUNT

24:09.815 --> 24:12.283
Oh, ha, ha, yeah.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.185
Okay, okay, knock it off.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.353
- Yes!
- Hey.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.587
Nice one.

24:16.588 --> 24:19.290
Hey, what are you kids,
stupid or something?

24:19.291 --> 24:22.291
Get out of here.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.294
Okay, come here, guys. Um--

24:25.464 --> 24:28.132
I want you to go play video games.
Come back in an hour.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.634
- All right!
- You're welcome.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.169
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Mom.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.538
- I'm first on "Atomic Destroyer."
- No, I am.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.642
Hi, Cheyenne, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a 5:00 with Richard.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.811
Oh, you didn't get our message?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.879
-Richard's out today.
-What?

24:41.880 --> 24:44.880
Someone got killed on his block.
Dragged down the street on fire.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.851
-Isn't that terrible?
-That's awful.

24:50.389 --> 24:53.389
So my appointment?
Is there someone else that can see me?

24:54.560 --> 24:57.560
Um, it's 10 to 6, and we close at 6,
so, ha-ha-ha...

24:59.498 --> 25:02.498
I understand, but the soccer game ran late,
and it's girls' night out tonight...

25:03.369 --> 25:06.304
...first time in months,
and I'm so looking forward to this.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.873
-Please. Please.
-Um--

25:08.874 --> 25:11.209
-Look at this.
-You're killing me.

25:11.210 --> 25:14.210
Thank you. Ah, thank you so much.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.753
Excuse me, that's--

25:22.988 --> 25:25.423
That is a little-- That's a little tight.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.591
- Ahem.
- Uh.

25:26.592 --> 25:29.592
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.729
So, Dee Dee, thank you for staying late.
How long have you been cutting hair?

25:36.769 --> 25:38.236
Long enough.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.407
Goddamn chair.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.842
I've only told them to fix it
like a million times.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.118
- Oh, Dee Dee?
- Yeah?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.987
Could I please get some water?

26:29.988 --> 26:32.988
- No problem.
- Thank you.

26:51.310 --> 26:54.310
- How's it going?
- Almost done.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.619
I love the color. It's exactly honey.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.256
Do you think?

27:58.243 --> 28:00.578
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.514
It won't happen again.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.551
It's okay.

28:06.552 --> 28:09.552
Wow.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.689
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.990
Whoa.

28:12.991 --> 28:15.991
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Cut it out.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.741
- Thanks, Dee Dee.
- You're welcome.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.743
Hope you have fun.

28:34.279 --> 28:37.248
-Stop.
-Okay, guys, knock it off.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.951
I am so sorry about this.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.952
These guys aren't gonna leave my sight
until I ship them to college.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.255
-Maybe military school?
-Ha, yeah, maybe.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.625
All right, boys, come on.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.230
Let's go. Get in the car.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.231
I've got my eye on you two.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.310
Oh, my God!

29:12.551 --> 29:15.551
It's that lady with the kids,
from the racetrack.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.458
We just lost a really hot MILF.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.593
-Dude, this is serious.
-Yeah.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.594
Don't you think it's weird
that two of the people Nick saved are dead?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.998
Weird is putting tampons in your kids' ears.
That's weird.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.002
She was bound to die sooner or later.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.003
That's actually why we asked you guys
to come over.

29:34.172 --> 29:37.172
The night before it happened,
Nick had a really strange dream.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.411
Great. I'm glad I cancelled my golf game
for this. Good.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.912
But it wasn't a dream.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.913
It was like these random sounds
and images.

29:45.317 --> 29:48.317
They really didn't make any sense.
And then I read what killed them...

29:48.920 --> 29:51.920
...and I realized that I'd seen
how the next person was gonna die.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.692
Wait, what do you mean,
"the next person"?

29:54.693 --> 29:57.693
Okay, don't laugh,
but we stayed up Googling premonitions...

29:58.964 --> 30:01.964
...visions, signs, things like that, just to see
how much information we could get.

30:04.202 --> 30:06.270
There are tons of articles about people...

30:06.271 --> 30:08.372
...who had a premonition
about a disaster...

30:08.373 --> 30:11.042
...they saved themselves...

30:11.043 --> 30:12.376
...and then they died.

30:12.377 --> 30:15.046
Okay, so people died. So what?

30:15.047 --> 30:17.315
Every survivor died.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.217
In the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident.

30:20.218 --> 30:22.219
Well, we survived.

30:22.220 --> 30:25.220
So now does that mean we all die?

30:27.059 --> 30:30.059
-Well, who's next?
-I don't remember.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.964
But there might be an out.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.334
Some say the chain can be broken.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.335
Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death...

30:39.404 --> 30:40.571
...that would end it.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.307
But others say
unless the chain is broken completely...

30:43.308 --> 30:46.308
...then you're just changing the batting
order, and sooner or later, you're up.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.748
That is some spooky psychobabble shit.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.184
shut up, please. This is not funny.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.185
-He could be watching a ton of TV.
-You know what this does to me.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.421
It's okay. All we're trying to do
is figure out what's going on.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.992
You are gonna have to
figure that out without me.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.993
You can call me later, but I gotta go.
Hope you have fun.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.031
Janet, come back. Don't leave.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.166
No, Lori. No.
You guys are freaking me out.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.769
What's with that?
She went from uptight but normal...

31:11.770 --> 31:13.437
...to uptight and totally insane.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.207
Why do you gotta be a prick?
She saw somebody die.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.943
- So did we.
- Yeah, and we're all freaked out.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.944
Would it kill you to be sensitive?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.348
I don't know.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.617
I've never tried it.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.052
Where are you going?

31:28.053 --> 31:31.053
If you're right
about this whole crash thing...

31:31.390 --> 31:34.390
...then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.

31:34.459 --> 31:37.459
I'm gonna go get laid.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.865
If I'm dying, I'm trying.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.866
Keep up the good fight, guys.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.640
And if I happen to bump into Janet,
I will check on her.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.445
Thanks.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.229
Well, that went well.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.230
Yeah, our friends think we're crazy.
It's great.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.468
Well, maybe we are.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.469
Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.574
You think?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.945
I hope so.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.658
Nick? What did you see?

32:43.795 --> 32:46.795
-l think we can stop it.
-How?

32:47.199 --> 32:50.199
We gotta go to the racetrack.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.876
Oh, my God.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.845
Look at this place.

33:00.846 --> 33:03.214
All those people just...

33:03.215 --> 33:05.816
- l don't wanna be here.
- I know, I know.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.817
But this is the only thing that I can think of
to help me remember the order.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.722
It's over here. This is where we were.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.466
Let's see if this works.

33:26.371 --> 33:29.371
The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.981
Then that racist and his wife.

33:51.663 --> 33:54.663
That woman with the kids, she was next.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.872
Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.385
I can't remember who dies when.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.954
-It's okay.
-I don't know what to do. I can't--

34:16.955 --> 34:19.623
Maybe this was a really bad idea.

34:19.623 --> 34:22.592
No.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.594
I gotta try.

34:26.231 --> 34:29.132
You better have a damn good reason
for trespassing.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.435
I just need to remember the order.

34:31.436 --> 34:34.436
Young man, that sounds crazy.
But maybe this will help you.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.746
Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.161
There.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.162
That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.499
- so he's next, then.
- I think so.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.806
That collapse kills Hunt and Janet.

35:13.311 --> 35:16.311
And that's when you die.

35:17.682 --> 35:20.682
And then Lori.

35:21.186 --> 35:24.186
Then me.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.860
Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed, we can break the chain...

35:32.797 --> 35:34.665
...and the rest of us will be safe.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.934
But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.935
- We know nothing about him.
- But we do know where he works.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.808
Grandstate Customs.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.344
Gotta finish up that differential.

35:47.345 --> 35:50.114
Bond that to the fibreglass on it.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.316
- Done with that impact?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.163
You just want that spot-welded, right?

36:11.803 --> 36:14.803
Hey, can you give me a hand
with this test probe?

36:16.541 --> 36:19.541
Good stuff, man.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.591
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

36:34.592 --> 36:37.592
Who's the fucking moron?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.764
You. What are you doing here?

36:40.765 --> 36:42.266
Trying to find you.

36:42.267 --> 36:45.267
Look, man, I'm sorry for being blunt,
but your life's in danger. You're gonna die.

36:46.404 --> 36:49.404
Three of the people who left that stadium
before that accident...

36:49.674 --> 36:51.775
...they're now dead.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.776
I'm sorry,
but we think that you're gonna be next.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.247
You're serious?

36:57.248 --> 36:58.582
Andy.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.583
You know you can't have these people here.
Take them outside. No visitors in here.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.954
Let's go.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.640
Look, man, I'm trying to put my life
back together, okay?

37:27.479 --> 37:30.479
I mean, watching Nadia die like that
in front of me...

37:32.817 --> 37:34.985
Hey, I know exactly how you feel.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.921
I lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.922
I was driving and I was drunk.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.426
Every day, I ask myself how come
it couldn't be me instead of them.

37:50.168 --> 37:53.168
For a long time,
I carried so much pain and anger...

37:53.671 --> 37:56.671
...it was actually destroying their memory.
So now I try to live each day in their name.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.983
Hey, guys, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm getting a really bad feeling.

38:08.753 --> 38:11.753
Look, kid,
I'm around dangerous equipment every day.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.856
If I was meant to die,
it would've happened by now.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.165
Look out!

38:24.269 --> 38:26.136
- Holy shit.
- You okay, Andy?

38:26.137 --> 38:29.137
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:29.374 --> 38:32.009
Well, I guess it's not my turn to die.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.010
Y'all take care.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.188
Holy--! You all right?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.656
Show us 20 at the body shop.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.958
Honey, I mean,
if you can stop the next death--

38:47.959 --> 38:50.327
I'm seeing clues,
but I can't piece them together.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.629
- You gotta think. Who's next?
- I don't know.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.331
We have to warn your friends.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.233
-How?
-Well, which one is next?

38:56.234 --> 38:59.234
-They both die in the collapse. I don't know.
-Nick, think. Focus.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.572
One of them had to be first, even if it
was one second before the other one.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.210
Was it Hunt, or was it Janet?

39:09.814 --> 39:12.349
You gotta find Janet.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.350
I'm gonna find Hunt. Okay?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.542
Oh, God. Faster, go faster.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.212
Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick it up.
Don't be lazy. Faster, faster.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.883
Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving.
Move. Oh!

39:48.419 --> 39:51.419
No, come on. Wake up.
No, we're not done. I'm not done.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.057
Come on.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.627
No, no.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.562
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:59.764 --> 40:02.466
I finished, like, four minutes ago.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.467
-Ever play "Donkey Punch"?
-Dick.

40:33.831 --> 40:36.831
Excuse me, miss,
but could you help a struggling artist?

40:39.604 --> 40:42.604
Sure.

40:46.344 --> 40:49.344
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.

40:49.347 --> 40:52.347
Let's see what we got here, Browning.

40:53.518 --> 40:56.518
A penny? That's some bullshit.

41:00.525 --> 41:03.525
Oh, damn it.

41:08.366 --> 41:11.366
Great.

41:24.382 --> 41:27.382
Come on, you custom piece of shit.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.057
Come on, pick up the phone. Come on.

41:34.058 --> 41:37.058
Aah. Where are you at? Come on.

42:01.586 --> 42:03.920
This is Hunt. You know what to do.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.921
Hunt, listen to me, buddy, listen.
No water, okay? Stay away from water.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.366
You have three messages marked urgent.

42:26.444 --> 42:29.444
That's funny, huh?

42:30.715 --> 42:33.450
-Give me the gun.
-No, ha, ha.

42:33.451 --> 42:36.119
Give me the fucking gun.

42:36.120 --> 42:39.120
No.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.802
Fucked up my phone.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.305
Shit.

44:06.711 --> 44:09.711
Perfect.

44:19.056 --> 44:21.558
Hey, Lori, I'm at the car wash.
I'll call you back.

44:21.559 --> 44:24.060
Janet, wait. Wait. Shit.

44:24.061 --> 44:26.363
Do you know if there's a car wash
around here?

44:26.364 --> 44:29.364
-Yeah, there's one on 18th.
-We gotta go there.

44:33.738 --> 44:36.738
Yes. I own you, machine.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.507
Lori?

45:10.508 --> 45:13.443
- What's so important?
- Don't go near water.

45:13.444 --> 45:14.611
What? Water?

45:14.612 --> 45:17.080
- Don't go near water!
- Water? Lori?

45:17.081 --> 45:20.081
Wait. Lori?

45:34.966 --> 45:37.966
Shit.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.648
No service.

45:51.649 --> 45:54.649
Shit.

46:01.225 --> 46:04.225
Come on, come on, come on.

46:06.631 --> 46:09.499
Come on.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.002
Lord, no.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.437
Close!

46:16.507 --> 46:19.507
Oh, stop it! Oh, my God, no!

46:22.179 --> 46:25.179
Oh, God! Help me!

46:35.293 --> 46:38.293
Please! Somebody, please!

46:43.367 --> 46:45.135
Pick up the phone, Janet.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.871
Oh, God! Help!

46:47.872 --> 46:50.872
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

46:59.550 --> 47:02.550
We're almost there.

47:07.124 --> 47:10.124
Oh, shit. Fore!

48:11.622 --> 48:14.622
No, no, no.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.093
- There it is.
- Hurry.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.905
Go around back, George. She's in there.

48:32.810 --> 48:35.810
No!

48:47.925 --> 48:50.925
Go, go, go!

48:51.829 --> 48:54.764
Lori! Lori, get me out of here!

48:54.765 --> 48:57.765
- Shit. I'm coming. Just hold on.
- Come on, get her out.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.935
- Lori, help me!
- I'm trying!

49:03.641 --> 49:06.641
Come here, I got you. I got you.

49:28.599 --> 49:31.599
Hunt.

50:12.243 --> 50:14.143
- So do you have insurance?
- Yeah.

50:14.144 --> 50:17.144
What are we supposed to do now?

50:17.848 --> 50:20.848
I mean, what's gonna happen to us?

50:21.719 --> 50:24.719
You know,
saving Janet either destroyed death's list...

50:24.755 --> 50:27.755
...and all of us are home free,
or it skips her for now and then...

50:31.729 --> 50:33.663
And I'm next.

50:33.664 --> 50:35.932
George, you can't give up.

50:35.933 --> 50:38.933
-No, it's okay.
-What do you mean, "it's okay"?

50:39.837 --> 50:42.837
-I mean, maybe if we all stick together--
-No, I'm at peace with it.

50:43.207 --> 50:46.207
And, um, my family's waiting for me.

50:48.512 --> 50:51.512
I'm ready to go.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.772
When we're done in here, we need to
make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next.

51:55.012 --> 51:58.012
I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.

51:59.516 --> 52:02.516
-Maybe he was in shock.
-No, that's not it.

52:03.287 --> 52:06.287
It was very clear. It's...
It's like he just accepted it.

52:07.925 --> 52:10.925
I think he's given up.

52:11.829 --> 52:14.464
If he dies, I'm next.

52:14.465 --> 52:17.465
And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.

52:17.534 --> 52:20.534
Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.

52:22.039 --> 52:24.774
I don't want anything to happen to you.

52:24.775 --> 52:27.775
And if we're together, it makes it easier
for death to take both of us.

52:28.479 --> 52:31.479
I don't care what happens.
We are in this together.

52:39.123 --> 52:42.123
Look.

52:44.895 --> 52:47.296
Maybe no one else has to die.

52:47.297 --> 52:50.233
We should go tell George.

52:52.403 --> 52:55.403
Hello?

52:57.841 --> 53:00.841
George.

53:01.879 --> 53:04.879
We think saving Janet broke the chain.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.920
George?

53:31.108 --> 53:34.108
-George?
-George?

53:38.582 --> 53:41.582
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. George--

53:42.419 --> 53:45.419
Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
After everything that we've been through.

53:46.457 --> 53:48.424
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

53:48.425 --> 53:50.727
Trying to give God
what I thought he wanted.

53:50.728 --> 53:53.728
I've been trying to kill myself all day.

53:54.598 --> 53:57.266
Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.

53:57.267 --> 54:00.267
Then I went to the garage,
hooked a hose from the tailpipe...

54:00.304 --> 54:02.438
...stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.

54:03.640 --> 54:06.640
Then...

54:08.879 --> 54:11.814
So wait.

54:11.815 --> 54:14.815
Saving Janet
must have destroyed the list, then.

54:19.990 --> 54:22.258
I think congratulations are in order.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.826
To breaking the chain.

54:23.827 --> 54:26.827
- Apple cider?
- Thank you.

54:27.831 --> 54:29.165
-Thank God.
-And a toast.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.433
Mm-hm.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.901
-To life.
-To life.

54:31.902 --> 54:34.902
- To life.
- Yes.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.340
Mm...

54:37.341 --> 54:40.341
We've been given a second chance.
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?

54:40.744 --> 54:43.513
- I have a few plans for us, ha, ha.
- Uh, oh-oh.

54:43.514 --> 54:46.514
Lots of travelling, like Paris,
maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez.

54:48.685 --> 54:51.685
I'm just thankful we have our whole lives
ahead of us, you know?

54:51.789 --> 54:53.156
Yeah.

54:53.157 --> 54:56.157
Now this is over,
I'm not gonna take another day for granted.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.962
Ever.

54:59.963 --> 55:02.963
You know, maybe it's time to stop talking
about doing stuff and actually start doing it.

55:04.201 --> 55:07.201
-You only live once, right?
-That's what I'm talking about.

55:09.206 --> 55:10.706
Let me get the cookies.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.180
We made it.

55:17.181 --> 55:20.181
We did.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.634
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

55:38.635 --> 55:41.237
- Did you get the traveller's checks?
- Yes, I did.

55:41.238 --> 55:43.039
Need anything from the mall?

55:43.040 --> 55:44.907
No, I think we're good.

55:44.908 --> 55:47.076
You sure you don't wanna come
to the movie?

55:47.077 --> 55:49.645
-It's in 3-D.
-Love Lays Dying?

55:49.646 --> 55:52.515
Yeah, I think I'll be all right.
Sounds like a chickflick.

55:52.516 --> 55:55.484
But, uh, I'll have everything packed
by the time you get home.

55:55.485 --> 55:58.087
Amsterdam, here we come.

55:58.088 --> 56:01.088
I can't believe we're actually going.
Um, heh--

56:01.191 --> 56:04.191
You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.

56:04.261 --> 56:07.063
speaking of, she's walking up right now.
I'm gonna run, okay?

56:07.064 --> 56:08.698
- Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.433
-Love you.
-Love you too. Be home soon.

56:10.434 --> 56:11.934
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:11.935 --> 56:14.935
-Hi.
-Hi, ha, ha.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.571
John Doe, the unknown survivor
of the speedway crash...

56:50.607 --> 56:53.607
...has finally been named
now that his family's been notified.

56:53.977 --> 56:56.977
Jonathan Groves was rescued
in the rubble.

57:00.484 --> 57:03.386
George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?

57:03.387 --> 57:05.154
Look, man, we got the order wrong.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.590
Remember that guy who sat in front of me?
The cowboy?

57:07.591 --> 57:10.591
He didn't die, which means he's next.
Look, just be there in five. I'm on my way.

57:23.173 --> 57:25.174
You feeling okay, Mr. Suby?

57:25.175 --> 57:27.677
Ha. Why do you care?

57:27.678 --> 57:30.678
You know how many of your kind
I killed in Korea?

57:31.481 --> 57:34.016
-I'm Chinese, sir.
-Ha, same difference.

57:34.017 --> 57:36.185
I need you in PT 3 right now.

57:36.186 --> 57:37.853
- Okay.
- And I do mean now.

57:37.854 --> 57:39.522
- Okay.
- Thank you.

57:39.523 --> 57:42.024
Be back in a few minutes
to get you into that tub.

57:45.195 --> 57:47.163
Dr. Helfrich to Obstetrics.

57:47.164 --> 57:50.164
Hey. Somebody. Hey. Help.

57:50.367 --> 57:53.367
Forgot to turn the water off.

57:53.537 --> 57:56.537
Help.

57:59.142 --> 58:02.142
Help. Somebody help.

58:02.346 --> 58:05.147
- Dr. Finn, extension 2861.
- Somebody help.

58:05.148 --> 58:07.683
Dr. Finn, extension 2861.

58:35.912 --> 58:38.912
George. George.

58:40.050 --> 58:41.250
Where's Lori?

58:41.251 --> 58:44.251
I've been calling and texting all afternoon.
She's not picking up.

58:44.488 --> 58:47.488
Maybe it won't matter. Come on.

59:04.107 --> 59:07.107
How can there be someone else on the list?
He didn't leave the racetrack with us.

59:08.211 --> 59:11.211
If I would've asked him to move
like in the premonition, he would've died.

59:11.782 --> 59:14.283
He survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.

59:14.284 --> 59:17.253
You weren't next, he was.
It wasn't destined at all.

59:17.254 --> 59:20.254
So if he dies, I'm next again.

59:22.592 --> 59:24.360
Great, man.

59:24.361 --> 59:26.862
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Taylor to Pathology.

59:26.863 --> 59:29.863
Dr. Sheila Taylor to Pathology.

59:51.221 --> 59:54.221
Yeah.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:22.416
-Those are really hot.
-Yes. I love these. I like how they--

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.489
-Oh!
-Aah! What the hell?

01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:32.695
Ow!

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:35.696
Ugh, hey. Stop--

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:48.041
That's genius. Someone could get killed.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:55.017
-Man, I'm feeling something.
-Don't lose hope, man.

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:58.018
If we keep an eye out for signs of danger,
I think we got a shot.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:01.188
-Let's just go find Lori and Janet.
-No, no, not that. I mean, it's like dejà vu.

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.827
My wife said that dejà vu
is like God's way of--

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.830
- Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go.
- Okay.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.347
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Okay, thanks.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.050
Hi. Do you have these in a six?

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.519
Yes, we bring them in fresh every day.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.555
- Hello.
- Oh!

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:34.190
-Cool, let's go.
-What do you think?

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.524
Ah...

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.525
Well, they're cute yet functional.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.996
I like them.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.899
They say, "I'm getting older,
but I still like to party." Ha, ha.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.735
Ha, ha, I didn't buy them for you,
I bought them for Nick.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:49.736
He likes me in sneaks.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.246
Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.747
Right off the corner brace?

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:00.549
Check the measurement. It's not fitting.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.550
Those windows won't pass.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.460
Yeah, 90 on that.

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:14.129
Yeah, that looks fine.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.798
Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.568
Yeah, around the corner.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.470
- Lunch, boys.
- Okay.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:24.471
Back in an hour.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.115
Is that yoghurt place still open?

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:36.116
- Yeah, I think they're still here.
- Wait. My shoelace is caught.

01:02:36.653 --> 01:02:38.587
- What?
- My shoelace is stuck.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.823
- Oh, okay, here.
- Just help me get it out.

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:43.824
- Look, I'm gonna grab your--
- It's not coming out, though, Janet.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:45.728
-Don't freak out.
-Pull my leg harder.

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:48.230
Help me try to get it out.
It's not coming loose.

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:51.231
- I am trying. I'm pulling.
- It's twisting my ankle. Ow! Ow!

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.573
Fuck.

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.175
I should've seen that one coming.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:03.176
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.660
Here's two for Love Lays Dying.
Enjoy the show.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:20.661
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.765
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello.

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:25.766
-Theatre 13, second door on your left.
-Thanks.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.370
- So, what do you want?
- I don't know.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.166
Where the hell you going?

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.780
Go. Go now. Cut him off.

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.021
- Are you fucking nuts?
- It's just up ahead.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.592
Hold on, pumpkin. We'll be there in no time.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:03.029
That's really cool.

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:09.469
- Down in front, asshole.
- That's so ridiculous.

01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:16.912
sir, move your feet.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.913
Put these in your ears. It's gonna get loud.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.651
What do you mean?

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.486
Look, don't get mad at me...

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:27.487
...but do you remember
when Nick said that he could see signs...

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.892
...before something bad
was gonna happen?

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:32.628
Well, now I think I'm seeing them.

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:36.997
Lori, it's over. Nothing is gonna happen.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.600
- Now can we please watch the movie?
- I'm going.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:15.168
Are you kidding me?

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.613
- Everybody off
- We'll never make it.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.283
It's gonna blow.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:31.284
Lori. Lori.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:33.689
- Lori!
- Shut up, man.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.690
Bye-bye, suckers.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.541
"Dixieland."

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.176
-Something's wrong.
-No kidding.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:57.177
-The person next to me won't shut up.
-No, I'm serious. Something's wrong.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.847
Things are happening
just like at the track.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.230
-Lori, you in here?
-Nick.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.768
-It's not over.
-What?

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.769
George is dead.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.741
Janet, come on.
We have to leave right now.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:28.742
No. No, I can't keep doing this, okay?
You're both nuts.

01:07:28.912 --> 01:07:31.912
-Janet, we gotta go. Come on.
-No. Don't you see?

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.582
This is where I was supposed to be
in the first place, not that race.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.052
-Come on. Come on.
-I was meant to see this movie.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:42.789
Bye-bye, suckers.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.072
Janet!

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.742
Lori, come on!

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.748
Find the way to the exit. Remain calm.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.492
Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.580
- I got you.
- Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.983
Nick! Nick!

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:43.785
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on! Hold on!

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.154
-Climb up my arm!
-Don't let me go!

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.524
Climb up my arm!

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:52.524
No! Hold on, I got you. I got you.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:06.171
No, no, no!

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:11.711
Lori, no! Lori, no!

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:19.388
I mean, it's dejà vu.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:21.890
-My wife said that dejà vu is God's way--
-Look out!

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.895
- Hurry.
- Get some help!

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.497
- Help.
- Over here!

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.497
Lori.

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:39.140
Hey, watch it.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:42.142
Down in front, asshole.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.716
Hey, come on, man.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.917
- Watch out.
- Hey.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.919
Hey, come on.

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:08.101
Janet, something's wrong.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:41.970
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.971
Uh, damn it.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.087
Fuck! Oh!

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.426
We were wrong about the order.
What if we're wrong about the chain?

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.297
Then we wouldn't be here at all.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.633
And yet here I am,
trying to watch a movie...

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.536
...despite my best friend going crazy
next to me.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.343
Oh, fuck.

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:01.181
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.529
It's gonna blow. Move it!

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.207
Come on. Come on.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.208
Bye-bye, suckers.

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:21.196
I guess this is
how I'm gonna be remembered.

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:24.132
Thanks.

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.720
Try to tie it off right there.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:48.156
That's good.

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.925
Just this side of the Union City.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.926
Hey, man, excuse me.
Is this thing supposed to be this way?

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.996
- Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter?
- You're right.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.668
Tell you what,
we'll get somebody on that.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.669
-Pays to be safe, man. Trust me.
-Yeah.

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:06.506
That's one down.

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:11.511
You wanna meet up with them now?

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.692
-Small mint tea.
-Thanks.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.294
- Small latte for you.
- Thank you.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:29.295
And for me...

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:31.666
Um, what the hell is that?

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:34.667
A giant chococcino with whipped cream,
chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.105
That looks disgusting.

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:39.874
Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma
just looking at it.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.875
Well, what can I say, ladies?
It looked good.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:48.216
Yeah, but it tastes totally disgusting.

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:55.021
Say, you're the guy
who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:59.325
You saved a lot of lives, man.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.163
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.164
Mm-hm. Sometimes that's all it takes.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:12.674
Okay, that was really weird.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.410
- Hey, don't knock my fan base.
- Heh, God.

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.078
I love your bag, by the way.

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:20.079
-Oh, thanks. I actually just got it.
-Did you? Where?

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.051
Yeah. There's a place
right next to Brevig's. It just opened.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:25.520
- Brevig's?
- Yeah, it's in that shopping center.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:28.521
There's a grocery store and a card shop'
and then there's a--

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:31.326
- It's like a little accessories store.
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:34.327
It's super cute. If you want one
of these purses, they have it in plaid.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.766
- Ha, ha, is that the only other one?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:40.767
They only made two?

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:56.783
What do you think, babe?

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.620
Hey, uh, space cadet,
you wanna come back down to Earth?

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.062
What if we didn't change anything?

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.731
-What are you talking about?
-Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.732
What if us being here right now...

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.937
...was the plan from the beginning?

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:22.455
