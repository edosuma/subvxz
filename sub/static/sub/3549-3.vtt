WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.605
SUSAN'S NEW BOYFRIEND
MET THE FAMILY.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.607
WHO ARE YOU?
 HI.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.140
I'M MIKE, THE EX-HUSBAND.
 AH.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.443
GABY'S LIFE
WAS NO LONGER GLAMOROUS.

00:12.443 --> 00:14.585
IT'S OFFICIAL.
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING--

00:14.585 --> 00:16.587
FIRST, OUR MONEY,
THEN MY FIGURE,

00:16.587 --> 00:19.790
NOW THE LAST THREADS
OF OUR SOCIAL STANDING.
 GABY, WE HAVE A HOME,

00:19.790 --> 00:21.722
AND WE HAVE
TWO BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRLS.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.725
DANIELLE'S DECISION
WAS DEVASTATING...

00:24.725 --> 00:27.728
PLEASE, JUST DON'T TAKE HIM!
BENJAMIN IS ALL I HAVE.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.401
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

00:30.401 --> 00:33.033
AND EDIE'S NEW HUSBAND
SHOWED A DARK SIDE.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.805
I WOULD CONSIDER IT
A PERSONAL FAVOR

00:34.805 --> 00:37.238
IF YOU'D APOLOGIZE TO EDIE.
 NO.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.340
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT A WOMAN LIKE YOU

00:39.340 --> 00:42.473
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THE FEW
FRIENDS THAT SHE HAS LEFT.
 I THINK YOU'D BETTER GO.

00:42.473 --> 00:44.775
WHY WOULD
YOU BRING ME FLOWERS?
 'CAUSE YOU GOT A COMPUTER,

00:44.775 --> 00:48.749
AND I NEED TO FIND OUT
SOME STUFF ABOUT EDIE'S HUSBAND.

00:53.084 --> 00:55.786
(Mary Alice) BENJAMIN KATZ
WAS 6 YEARS OLD,

00:55.786 --> 01:00.060
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.534
HE WASN'T SURE WHY
THE WOMAN YOU CALL "MOMMY"

01:03.534 --> 01:07.238
ISN'T ALWAYS YOUR MOTHER.

01:07.238 --> 01:10.741
OR HOW THE MAN
WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HIM

01:10.741 --> 01:14.505
COULD SUDDENLY BE TAKEN AWAY.

01:14.505 --> 01:17.808
OR WHY YOU COULD
GO FOR A RIDE...

01:17.808 --> 01:21.682
AND NEVER COME BACK HOME.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.185
YES,
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

01:24.185 --> 01:26.657
BENJAMIN KATZ
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND,

01:26.657 --> 01:29.490
AND NO ONE SEEMED IN A HURRY

01:29.490 --> 01:31.822
TO EXPLAIN THEM.

01:31.822 --> 01:34.125
(Bree)
HERE THEY COME, FINALLY.

01:34.125 --> 01:37.128
YOU KNOW, BREE, THINGS WILL BE
A LITTLE STRANGE AT FIRST,

01:37.128 --> 01:39.099
SO PLEASE,
BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.101
I DO NOT REQUIRE LECTURES
ON TACT.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.604
I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT
WE'VE MISSED BENJY SO MUCH,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.606
AND IT'S TAKEN
SO MANY OLIVE BRANCHES

01:45.606 --> 01:48.609
TO GET THEM TO COME BACK.
 I'M AWARE
OF WHAT'S AT STAKE, ORSON.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
GOOD. SO IF YOU FEEL AN IMPULSE
TO CRITICIZE SOMETHING,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.613
YOU'LL KEEP THE THOUGHT
TO YOURSELF.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.545
HI!

01:54.545 --> 01:55.846
(chuckles)

01:55.846 --> 01:57.648
(chuckles nervously)
I'VE ALREADY STARTED.

01:57.648 --> 02:02.593
DANIELLE! WHAT A DELIGHTFULLY
ETHNIC ENSEMBLE.

02:02.593 --> 02:05.596
HEY, MOM, ORSON.
 HI, DANIELLE.

02:05.596 --> 02:07.698
OH, I WANT TO MEET
MY HUSBAND LEO.

02:07.698 --> 02:10.701
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET
BOTH OF YOU IN PERSON.
 LOVELY TO MEET YOU, LEO.

02:10.701 --> 02:12.703
HEY, WHO'S THIS
LITTLE LINEBACKER?

02:12.703 --> 02:16.267
HI, BENJY. REMEMBER ME?
 I'M NOT SURE.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.840
THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S WHAT
THIS VISIT IS FOR, RIGHT?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.842
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.275
NOW WE HAVE YOU FOR
THE WHOLE WEEKEND, RIGHT?

02:24.275 --> 02:25.676
YEP, WHOLE THREE DAYS.

02:25.676 --> 02:27.848
OH, GOOD.
'CAUSE WE'VE MADE LOTS OF PLANS.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.451
WE'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU TO THE CIRCUS

02:30.451 --> 02:33.153
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOUR FOLKS.
 CAN I GO, DANIELLE?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.356
"DANIELLE"? DID HE JUST
CALL YOU "DANIELLE"?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.588
WELL, IT IS MY NAME.

02:37.588 --> 02:40.491
YES, I'M AWARE OF THAT.
I PICKED IT.

02:40.491 --> 02:42.193
I'M JUST CONCERNED

02:42.193 --> 02:45.636
PEOPLE MIGHT VIEW IT
AS A SIGN OF, UM, DISRESPECT.

02:45.636 --> 02:47.938
BY "PEOPLE," YOU MEAN YOU?

02:47.938 --> 02:51.302
UH... LEO. LOOK AT ALL
THE LUGGAGE YOU HAVE HERE.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.874
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND HERE.
OKAY.
 OH, THANKS.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.377
UM... LET ME BE CLEAR.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.450
(lowers voice) I DO NOT
WANT HIM CALLING ME "BREE."

02:59.450 --> 03:02.453
OH, DON'T WORRY. I TOLD HIM
TO CALL YOU "GRANNY."

03:04.315 --> 03:08.619
YES, BENJAMIN KATZ
WAS ONLY 6 YEARS OLD,

03:08.619 --> 03:11.262
BUT EVEN HE COULD UNDERSTAND

03:11.262 --> 03:13.764
THIS WAS GOING TO BE...

03:13.764 --> 03:26.206
A LONG WEEKEND.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
ANY CHILD WILL TELL YOU

03:28.208 --> 03:30.381
THAT WHERE YOU FIND
A PLAYGROUND,

03:30.381 --> 03:33.244
YOU WILL ALSO FIND...

03:33.244 --> 03:34.615
BULLIES--

03:34.615 --> 03:36.617
YOUNG TYRANTS WHO BRING PAIN...

03:36.617 --> 03:38.319
AAH!

03:38.319 --> 03:39.890
INTIMIDATION...

03:39.890 --> 03:41.752
AAH!

03:41.752 --> 03:43.994
AND VIOLENCE.

03:43.994 --> 03:47.328
WHAT CAN CHILDREN DO
IN THE FACE OF SUCH TORMENT?

03:47.328 --> 03:50.731
WELL,
THERE IS ONE OBVIOUS OPTION,

03:50.731 --> 03:56.337
BUT NOT EVERY CHILD IS EAGER
TO GO RUNNING HOME TO MOTHER.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.968
(door opens)
 UGH. HEY. HON.

03:57.968 --> 04:00.371
HOW WAS THE PARK?
WAIT. HOLD ON.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.873
MOMMY JUST FOUND
HER FIRST GRAY HAIR.

04:02.873 --> 04:07.017
I NEED YOU TO GRAB IT, YANK IT
AND NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN.

04:07.017 --> 04:09.920
OH. LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.682
IT'S SCRATCHED.

04:11.682 --> 04:12.983
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:12.983 --> 04:15.326
NOTHING.

04:15.326 --> 04:17.928
AND YOUR SHIRT IS RIPPED.

04:17.928 --> 04:19.930
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
THIS WEEK.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.962
IS SOMEONE PICKING ON YOU?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.638
WHO IS IT?

04:27.638 --> 04:30.801
IS IT JEFFREY HIXON,
THAT WEIRD KID WHO EATS PAPER?

04:32.443 --> 04:33.944
IS IT TIMMY CROWLEY?

04:33.944 --> 04:36.407
HIS MOM SLEPT IN HER CAR
LAST NIGHT.

04:36.407 --> 04:39.580
WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.882
IS IT THAT BOY
FROM YOUR BIRTHDAY,

04:41.882 --> 04:45.486
THE ONE WHO SLUGGED
THE PONY?

04:45.486 --> 04:48.589
OH, SWEETIE.
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.891
BUT YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IF YOU TALK ABOUT IT.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.825
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T
TELL ME. I'M YOUR MOMMY.

04:54.825 --> 04:57.928
I WANNA TALK TO DADDY.

04:57.928 --> 05:01.372
OH.

05:01.372 --> 05:03.774
OKAY.

05:03.774 --> 05:05.776
WE'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.

05:08.879 --> 05:10.711
(man) OKAY!

05:10.711 --> 05:13.714
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANOTHER ONE IN THIS CONDITION.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.716
I MEAN, THE CAR IS A CLASSIC.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.848
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
NABILA?

05:17.848 --> 05:20.351
EH. I LIKE IT.
I DON'T LOVE IT.

05:20.351 --> 05:21.852
(Carlos) TELL YOU WHAT.

05:21.852 --> 05:24.855
GABY AND I WANT
TO FIND OUR CAR A NICE HOME.

05:24.855 --> 05:29.560
SO I'M PREPARED TO KNOCK
A GRAND OFF. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 I SAY KNOCK OFF 5 GRAND,
AND WE'LL TALK.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.463
OH, COME ON. IT'S ALREADY
PRICED WAY BELOW BLUE BOOK,

05:32.463 --> 05:34.765
NOT TO MENTION IT'S MINT.
 THIS IS NOT MINT.

05:34.765 --> 05:37.868
HEY, CAN YOU NOT SEE THIS DING
IN THE BUMPER HERE?

05:37.868 --> 05:40.941
OKAY, THIS CAR GOES ZERO TO 60
IN 5 SECONDS.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.943
BY THE TIME SOMEONE SAYS,
"WOW, A DING,"

05:42.943 --> 05:45.876
YOU'RE IN THE NEXT COUNTY.
 4 GRAND,
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

05:45.876 --> 05:47.748
DEAL.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.880
WHAT? NO! NO, NO DEAL!

05:49.880 --> 05:52.583
THE NONDRIVING BLIND GUY
DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ME.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.625
(sighs)
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?

05:54.625 --> 05:57.628
GABY, WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MOVE THIS CAR FOR A MONTH.

05:57.628 --> 05:59.089
WE NEED THE CASH.

05:59.089 --> 06:02.092
(sighs) GOD, ISN'T THERE
ANY WAY WE CAN KEEP IT?

06:02.092 --> 06:04.565
I MEAN, THIS CAR'S
THE LAST THING I HAVE

06:04.565 --> 06:07.067
THAT TELLS THE WORLD,
"I'M BETTER THAN YOU."

06:07.067 --> 06:09.570
SORRY, BABE.
WE HAVE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.072
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

06:18.649 --> 06:20.581
HERE.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.553
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.

06:22.553 --> 06:25.916
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT FOR US.
IT'S FOR OUR NANNY.

06:29.059 --> 06:32.523
OKAY, THAT ONE HURT.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.897
HEY.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.999
SO WHAT'D YOU DIG UP
ON MR. X.?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.501
YOU MEAN DAVE?
 YEAH.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.434
NOTHING YET.
 IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS.
WHAT GIVES?

06:43.434 --> 06:46.437
WELL, FOR STARTERS, WHEN
I SEARCH FOR "DAVE WILLIAMS,"

06:46.437 --> 06:48.609
I GET
A MILLION AND A HALF HITS.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.911
TO NARROW IT DOWN,
I'M GONNA NEED MORE INFORMATION,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.814
LIKE WHERE HE WAS BORN,
WHERE HE WENT TO SCHOOL.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.447
DID HE SERVE TIME
IN THE MILITARY?
 OH, BELIEVE ME,

06:56.447 --> 06:58.689
IF HE SERVED TIME,
IT WAS IN THE STATE PEN.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.591
HEY! DAVE!

07:00.591 --> 07:02.523
MORNING, LADIES.
 (tires screech)

07:02.523 --> 07:05.456
(under breath)
SICK BASTARD.
 HOW ARE YOU?

07:05.456 --> 07:06.426
HEY, KATHERINE,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.729
YOUR SPRINKLER SYSTEM
WORKING OKAY NOW?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.731
LIKE A CHARM.
AND THANKS AGAIN.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.734
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO GET THAT TO WORK.
 OH, I HEAR YA.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.906
TO PROGRAM THOSE THINGS,
YOU NEED AN ENGINEERING DEGREE.

07:15.906 --> 07:18.208
(laughs)
 OH, YEAH?
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE?

07:18.208 --> 07:20.641
ANYWAY...
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.644
TAKE CARE.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.075
OH.

07:25.075 --> 07:27.818
I JUST CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

07:27.818 --> 07:30.220
HE--HE JUST STRIKES ME
AS SO NICE.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.082
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO COMFORT ME,

07:32.082 --> 07:34.755
GIVEN YOUR TRACK RECORD
WITH MEN?

07:34.755 --> 07:37.588
KATHERINE, PLEASE.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.590
THE GUY IS BAD NEWS.

07:39.590 --> 07:42.593
I CAN'T PROVE IT,
BUT I FEEL IT IN MY BONES.

07:42.593 --> 07:45.566
AND I CAN'T SIT AROUND
DOING NOTHING WHEN I KNOW

07:45.566 --> 07:49.099
THAT EDIE'S WAKING UP
EVERY MORNING NEXT TO HIM.

07:49.099 --> 07:51.772
IF ANYONE FINDS OUT
WE'RE DOING THIS...

07:51.772 --> 07:53.243
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

07:53.243 --> 07:56.747
AND WHEN THEY DO,
THEY'LL PROBABLY THANK US.

07:56.747 --> 08:01.882
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YA,
THIS GUY IS UP TO SOMETHING.

08:04.214 --> 08:07.257
CLEANING OUT THE OLD GARAGE--
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY.

08:07.257 --> 08:09.990
HEY, DAVE.
YOU--YOU SETTLING IN OKAY?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.592
YEAH. YEAH.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.094
WELL, THEY FINALLY DELIVERED
MY FLAT SCREEN.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.197
I WAS DYING WITHOUT IT.
I MEAN, IT IS 65 INCHES.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.229
WOW. SWEET!

08:19.229 --> 08:22.232
HEY, W--THE PLAY-OFFS ARE ON.
YOU SHOULD COME CHECK IT OUT.

08:22.232 --> 08:24.535
IT'S LIKE BEING
RIGHT ON THE FIELD.

08:24.535 --> 08:25.636
YEAH...

08:25.636 --> 08:27.638
UM, LYNETTE'S
REALLY BUSTING MY HUMP

08:27.638 --> 08:29.680
ABOUT CLEARING
THIS PLACE OUT, SO...

08:29.680 --> 08:30.981
WELL, MAYBE LATER.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.544
THE GAME DOESN'T START
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

08:33.544 --> 08:36.547
WE COULD ORDER
ONE OF THOSE GIANT SANDWICHES.
 SORRY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
CHECK BACK WITH ME,

08:36.547 --> 08:38.818
MAKE SURE I SURVIVE
THIS WHOLE THING.
 OKAY.

08:38.818 --> 08:39.990
HI, DAVE.

08:39.990 --> 08:40.951
HI.

08:40.951 --> 08:42.251
HEY, TOM?

08:42.251 --> 08:44.024
YEAH?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.926
WHY ARE THERE TWO PILES?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.629
WELL, THAT'S THE PILE
THAT I'M THROWING AWAY,

08:48.629 --> 08:51.131
AND, UH, THIS IS THE STUFF
I STILL NEED.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.935
YOU NEED UNOPENED MOUNTAIN
CLIMBING EQUIPMENT FROM 1986?

08:54.935 --> 08:57.708
YOU DON'T CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.941
NOT YET, BUT SOMEDAY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW... WHO KNOWS?

09:00.941 --> 09:04.044
(laughs) I KNOW. YOU GET WINDED
JUST CLIMBING OUT OF THE TUB.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.016
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA CLIMB
A MOUNTAIN.

09:06.016 --> 09:08.148
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA DO?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.851
LEARN GERMAN,
MAKE YOUR OWN BEER OR...

09:10.851 --> 09:12.552
HAVE 8 MINUTE ABS.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.826
COME ON, NOT THE AB-TASTIC.
 TOSS IT, AND KEEP TOSSING

09:15.826 --> 09:18.889
UNTIL THIS 2-CAR GARAGE
CAN HOLD AT LEAST ONE CAR.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.133
(sighs)

09:24.965 --> 09:28.238
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
GETTING RID OF YOUR BASS.

09:28.238 --> 09:30.240
NO POINT
IN HANGING ON TO IT.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.644
I MEAN, BEING IN A BAND IS JUST
ONE MORE THING I'LL NEVER DO.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.606
BEFORE HE MOVED,
MIKE AND I,

09:35.606 --> 09:38.909
WE USED TO GET TOGETHER
ON SATURDAYS AND JUST... JAM.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.781
MAN, THAT WAS FUN.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.013
YOU KNOW, I PLAY THE DRUMS.

09:43.013 --> 09:45.716
MAYBE YOU AND I
SHOULD JAM SOMETIME.

09:48.218 --> 09:50.360
I GUESS WE COULD.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.992
MAYBE EVEN LATER TODAY?
JUST...

09:51.992 --> 09:54.965
YEAH! YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE HOURS.

09:54.965 --> 09:58.729
I GOTTA STASH
THESE OLD "PLAYBOYS." (laughs)
 I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:23.053 --> 10:25.696
NOW REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T
JUST START GRILLING EDIE,

10:25.696 --> 10:28.899
OR SHE'LL GET SUSPICIOUS.
WE HAVE TO BE SUBTLE.

10:28.899 --> 10:32.262
I'LL JUST FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.
 (door opens and shuts)

10:32.262 --> 10:33.764
OKAY.

10:33.764 --> 10:36.737
SORRY I'M LATE.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.709
WHAT A GREAT IDEA!

10:38.709 --> 10:42.642
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN AGES--
A FUN LUNCH WITH THE GIRLS.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.274
YEAH, IT'S FUN.

10:44.274 --> 10:45.776
WHERE WAS DAVE BORN?

10:45.776 --> 10:46.847
(gags and spits)

10:46.847 --> 10:48.819
WHAT?

10:48.819 --> 10:50.781
(chuckles nervously)
WE WERE JUST WONDERING

10:50.781 --> 10:52.783
WHERE HE GOT
HIS GREAT... MANNERS.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.285
HE'S GOT THAT GENTLE BEARING

10:55.285 --> 10:58.088
OF A... (Southern accent)
SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN.

10:58.088 --> 11:00.230
NO, HE'S FROM SOMEWHERE
IN THE MIDWEST.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.391
"SOMEWHERE"?

11:01.391 --> 11:04.034
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOUR HUSBAND GREW UP?

11:04.034 --> 11:07.037
WELL, HE SHOWED ME A PICTURE
OF HIS CHILDHOOD HOME ONCE.

11:07.037 --> 11:09.669
IT HAD A COW IN IT.
(sighs) I LOST INTEREST.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.872
HONESTLY, EDIE, HOW CAN
YOU BE MARRIED TO A GUY

11:11.872 --> 11:13.874
AND NOT KNOW THESE THINGS?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.876
YOU KNOW WHAT?
 WHAT?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.348
I THINK IT'S TIME TO ORDER.
WHERE'S OUR WAITRESS?

11:18.348 --> 11:20.310
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU,
MRS. MAYFAIR.

11:20.310 --> 11:23.013
OH, NO PROBLEM, DEBBIE.
YOU TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:23.013 --> 11:25.285
SHE IS SUCH A SWEET GIRL.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.287
SHE'S SAVING MONEY
FOR COLLEGE.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.859
OH.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.762
SPEAKING OF WHICH...
WHERE DID DAVE GO TO COLLEGE?

11:31.762 --> 11:34.394
COME ON, DEBBIE!
WHILE WE'RE YOUNG!

11:34.394 --> 11:36.326
I DON'T KNOW.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.468
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL?

11:38.468 --> 11:41.231
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

11:41.231 --> 11:44.274
I JUST THINK IT'S ODD THAT
YOU'RE MARRIED TO SOME GUY--

11:44.274 --> 11:47.207
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.940
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT HE'S A LOVELY MAN.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.212
HE... (chuckles nervously)
FIXED MY SPRINKLER.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.216
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.288
I'M GOING TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

12:02.252 --> 12:04.494
WELL, YOUR SUBTLE APPROACH
GOT US NOWHERE.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
WITH THIS BABY.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.201
I HATE TO SELL HER,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

12:11.201 --> 12:14.204
WITH MY NEW SPORTS CAR COMING,
I DON'T REALLY NEED IT.

12:14.204 --> 12:17.007
YEAH. HERE SHE IS.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.141
HOW'S IT LOOK?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.843
BE GLAD YOU'RE BLIND.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.845
WE HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL.

12:24.845 --> 12:28.018
WE JUST NEED SOMETHING TO GET US
FROM POINT "A" TO POINT "B."

12:28.018 --> 12:31.181
NOW LET'S BUY THE THING.
 OKAY, JUST LET ME HANDLE THIS.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.183
SO... DO WE HAVE A SALE?

12:33.183 --> 12:35.525
(clicks tongue)
I DON'T KNOW, ANDREW.

12:35.525 --> 12:39.459
I MEAN... WE LIKE IT.
WE DON'T LOVE IT.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.462
YEAH, WELL, NO ONE BUYS A CAR
LIKE THIS AND LOVES IT.

12:42.462 --> 12:46.236
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PRICE.
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO BETTER.

12:46.236 --> 12:48.238
YEAH, ABOUT THAT PRICE--

12:48.238 --> 12:51.171
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DROP IT.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THESE DENTS.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.173
YEAH, IT'S ALSO MISSING
THREE HUBCAPS,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.946
AND IT'S GOT A HANGER
FOR AN ANTENNA.

12:55.946 --> 12:57.978
FULL DISCLOSURE--
IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.050
YOU WANT IT OR NOT?

13:00.050 --> 13:02.052
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.014
SINCE YOUR MOM AND I ARE
 DEAR FRIENDS,

13:04.014 --> 13:06.516
I'LL TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS
IF YOU KNOCK OFF $300.

13:06.516 --> 13:09.019
AND SINCE MY MOM AND YOU
ARE DEAR FRIENDS,

13:09.019 --> 13:12.162
I'LL RESIST THE URGE
TO FLIP YOU THE BIRD.

13:12.162 --> 13:13.793
ANDREW!

13:13.793 --> 13:17.127
UNLESS YOU LOWER THIS PRICE,
WE'RE WALKING... RIGHT NOW.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.999
SEE YA.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.470
(scoffs) I MEAN IT.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.002
THIS IS IT.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.073
FINE.

13:23.073 --> 13:24.404
FINE.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.882
(scoffs)

13:31.882 --> 13:35.045
OKAY, FINE. KNOCK OFF $200,
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU CASH.

13:35.045 --> 13:37.217
NO.
 $100.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.049
NO.
 WH--

13:39.049 --> 13:42.022
(scoffs) WILL YOU AT LEAST
HAVE IT WASHED?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.454
I'LL EMPTY THE ASHTRAY.
FINAL OFFER.

13:44.454 --> 13:46.556
(scoffs) DAMN YOU.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.205
(Orson) OH!

13:55.205 --> 13:57.067
YOU BEAT ME AGAIN!

13:57.067 --> 14:00.510
CURSE YOU AND YOUR DIABOLICAL
CHECKERS PROWESS.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.472
(Orson and Benjamin laugh)
 ALL RIGHT, ORSON.

14:02.472 --> 14:05.145
DON'T OVEREXCITE HIM
ON THE UPHOLSTERY.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.348
SO, DANIELLE, WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO MAKE AS A SIDE DISH

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
FOR YOUR WELCOME HOME PARTY?

14:10.350 --> 14:14.084
I CAN DO ANYTHING SO LONG AS IT
COMPLEMENTS BEEF TENDERLOIN.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.626
ACTUALLY, WE DON'T EAT MEAT.
WE'RE VEGETARIANS.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.991
EXCUSE ME?
 SO IS BENJAMIN.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.900
OH. WELL... SINCE WHEN?

14:29.900 --> 14:33.974
SINCE I REALIZED THAT MEAT
WAS A BYPRODUCT OF MURDER.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.976
WOULD IT BE MORE ACCEPTABLE

14:35.976 --> 14:38.248
IF I SHOPPED FOR
A SUICIDAL PORK LOIN?

14:38.248 --> 14:40.450
BREE, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.452
I'LL JUST MAKE
A NICE RISOTTO.

14:42.452 --> 14:43.954
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DINNER.

14:43.954 --> 14:46.116
THIS IS ABOUT
HER NUTTY LIBERAL POLITICS

14:46.116 --> 14:48.888
GETTING IN THE WAY
OF OUR GRANDSON'S NUTRITION.

14:48.888 --> 14:53.463
HE GETS ALL THE PROTEIN HE NEEDS
FROM CHEESE AND BEANS AND TOFU.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.425
WELL, THIS ISN'T JUST
 ABOUT NUTRITION.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.998
DO YOU WANT HIM
TO BE TEASED AT SCHOOL

14:57.998 --> 15:00.900
EVERY TIME HE PULLS TOFU
OUT OF HIS LUNCHBOX?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.004
ACTUALLY,
THAT WON'T BE AN ISSUE.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.536
DANIELLE IS
HOMESCHOOLING HIM.

15:06.536 --> 15:08.438
EXCUSE ME?

15:08.438 --> 15:10.610
YOU'RE TEACHING HIM?

15:10.610 --> 15:13.083
YES. I TAKE IT
YOU HAVE AN OPINION?

15:13.083 --> 15:15.585
SO INSTEAD OF SENDING HIM
TO A PROPER SCHOOL,

15:15.585 --> 15:17.547
YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT

15:17.547 --> 15:19.919
OF YOUR STRAIGHT "C" AVERAGE?
 HEY, HE'S ONLY 6,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.952
AND HE'S ALREADY READING
AT A THIRD GRADE LEVEL.

15:21.952 --> 15:24.054
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR
WHEN HE OVERTAKES YOU?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.528
UH, BREE... AHEM.
BEST BEHAVIOR, REMEMBER?

15:28.528 --> 15:31.461
I AM SORRY,
BUT AM I SUPPOSED TO SIT BY

15:31.461 --> 15:34.204
WHILE SHE DEGRADES HIS BODY
AND HIS MIND?

15:34.204 --> 15:36.566
(Danielle) FINE.
 (sets down glass)

15:36.566 --> 15:38.438
CRITICIZE MY PARENTING
ALL YOU WANT.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.470
I DON'T CARE,

15:40.470 --> 15:43.613
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE
HOW HE'S RAISED ANYMORE.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.475
I'M HIS MOTHER.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.449
OH!

15:49.449 --> 15:52.152
AND BY THE WAY,
MARK YOUR CALENDARS,

15:52.152 --> 15:54.154
'CAUSE SEVEN YEARS
FROM NEXT SATURDAY--

15:54.154 --> 15:57.257
BENJAMIN'S BAR MITZVAH.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.194
(chuckles nervously)

16:06.496 --> 16:11.301
♪♪♪

16:11.301 --> 16:12.442
HEY! (laughs)

16:14.104 --> 16:15.345
(chuckles) HEY.

16:15.345 --> 16:18.348
ISN'T THIS COOL? DAVE BROUGHT
HIS DRUMS OVER SO WE COULD JAM.

16:18.348 --> 16:22.282
YOUR BOY IS PRETTY GOOD.
 YEAH, AND WE FIGURED OUT
WE GOT BASS, WE GOT DRUMS.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.085
MIKE PLAYS GUITAR.
I THINK ORSON PLAYS KEYBOARDS.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.588
YOU SEE WHERE
I AM GOING WITH THIS?
 I DO,
BUT I'M HOPING I'M WRONG.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.720
WE'RE GONNA START
A GARAGE BAND!

16:30.720 --> 16:34.364
AND I WASN'T!
 MAYBE IF WE GET GOOD ENOUGH,

16:34.364 --> 16:36.366
WE CAN EVEN GET, LIKE,
A COUPLE OF GIGS.

16:36.366 --> 16:39.429
HOW FUN WOULD THAT BE?
 "GIGS"?
DID YOU JUST SAY "GIGS"?

16:39.429 --> 16:42.001
NOW ALL'S WE NEED IS
A LITTLE TIME TO PRACTICE--

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
A FEW NIGHTS A WEEK,
SOME WEEKENDS.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.475
WHAT?
 WELL, YEAH,

16:45.475 --> 16:49.339
JUST UNTIL WE GET THE RHYTHM
SECTION ALL DIALED IN.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.582
OKAY, I NEED TO DIAL YOU IN
TO SOME GIGS YOU ALREADY HAVE,

16:52.582 --> 16:55.585
WHICH ARE RUNNING A RESTAURANT,
BEING A HUSBAND AND A FATHER.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.617
AND I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID

16:57.617 --> 17:00.190
YOU WANTED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.592
BUT WE COULD PLAY CLUBS.

17:02.592 --> 17:05.425
I MEAN, HE'S JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN, LYNETTE.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.426
GUYS NEED TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.559
COULD YOU JUST...
FOR A SEC?

17:09.559 --> 17:13.532
COME ON. YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.
YOU'RE FAR TOO BUSY FOR THIS.

17:19.368 --> 17:20.710
WHOA.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.444
YOU CAN'T JUST
DECIDE FOR ME LIKE THAT.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.516
I MEAN,
IF I WANNA PLAY BASS,

17:26.516 --> 17:28.818
I WILL PLAY BASS.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.520
I'M NOT HURTING ANYBODY.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.522
THOSE OF US WITH HEARING
BEG TO DIFFER. (laughs)

17:32.522 --> 17:34.124
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:34.124 --> 17:36.226
PLEASE LEAVE
OUR REHEARSAL SPACE.

17:36.226 --> 17:38.728
OH, COME ON, TOM.
THIS IS NOT YOUR--

17:38.728 --> 17:42.592
(playing Deep Purple's
"Smoke on the Water")

17:42.592 --> 17:45.595
(drums playing rhythm)

17:57.247 --> 17:59.249
(Juanita) IT'S MINE!
 NO!

17:59.249 --> 18:01.251
GIVE IT! GIVE IT!
 NO! NO!

18:01.251 --> 18:03.253
GIVE IT TO ME! IT'S MINE!
 DON'T!

18:03.253 --> 18:05.255
GUYS! HEY!
KNOCK IT OFF BACK THERE.

18:05.255 --> 18:08.318
(girls speak indistinctly)

18:08.318 --> 18:12.091
(engine sputtering)

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
(horn honks)

18:14.093 --> 18:16.196
(horn blares)

18:16.196 --> 18:17.797
(sputtering continues)

18:17.797 --> 18:19.299
(coughs)

18:19.299 --> 18:21.731
OH, GOD. WHAT NOW?
 (coughs)

18:24.774 --> 18:28.107
(steam hissing)

18:30.180 --> 18:33.313
OH. HEY. WHAT'S UP?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.315
YOU SOLD ME A LEMON.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.886
THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.888
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:38.888 --> 18:40.220
YOUR CAR!

18:40.220 --> 18:43.793
I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC,
WHO TOLD ME THE RADIATOR'S SHOT.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.455
OH. THAT. YEAH. (chuckles)

18:45.455 --> 18:48.698
IT'S BEEN GIVING ME TROUBLE
FOR YEARS. JUST USE THE JUG.

18:48.698 --> 18:50.200
WHAT JUG?

18:50.200 --> 18:53.203
OH, IT'S IN THE TRUNK.
YOU JUST KEEP IT FULL OF WATER,

18:53.203 --> 18:55.665
AND WHEN THE RADIATOR OVERHEATS,
YOU FILL IT UP.

18:55.665 --> 18:57.737
OH, AND, UH,
TRY NOT GOING UP HILLS

18:57.737 --> 19:00.510
AND STAY IN THE SHADE
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

19:00.510 --> 19:03.613
OKAY, I-I CAN'T DRIVE AROUND
AVOIDING GRAVITY AND THE SUN.

19:03.613 --> 19:04.914
WELL, SORRY.

19:04.914 --> 19:08.518
IF YOU WANT A CAR WITH NO FLAWS,
BUY A NEW ONE.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.520
OR I COULD
GET THE RADIATOR FIXED,

19:10.520 --> 19:13.683
WHICH IS GONNA COST $300,
WHICH YOU ARE PAYING FOR.

19:13.683 --> 19:15.154
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.487
REMEMBER FULL DISCLOSURE?
CRAP?

19:17.487 --> 19:20.430
THIS IS YOUR CAR.
IT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

19:20.430 --> 19:23.533
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.
I WANNA TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.895
UH, WELL, SHE'S IN A MEETING
RIGHT NOW.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.598
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?
 DAMN IT, ANDREW.

19:28.598 --> 19:31.901
YOU TELL BREE TO CALL ME
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.804
MAY I ASK
WHAT IT'S REGARDING?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.450
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
MORE LATER, BUDDY.

19:40.450 --> 19:43.553
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON OUTSIDE
AND PLAY FOR A WHILE?
 OKAY.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.289
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?
 WELL, HE STILL WON'T TELL ME
WHO'S PICKING ON HIM,

19:49.289 --> 19:53.663
BUT HE DID ASK ME
TO TEACH HIM HOW TO FIGHT.
 HE'S ONLY 5.
I DON'T WANT HIM FIGHTING.

19:53.663 --> 19:55.525
I'M SORRY, BUT EVERY BOY

19:55.525 --> 19:58.528
HAS TO LEARN HOW
TO THROW A PUNCH EVENTUALLY.
 UGH. (sighs)

19:58.528 --> 20:00.930
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANNA
GIVE HIM A LEG UP,

20:00.930 --> 20:03.803
YOU COULD TEACH HIM
A LITTLE CAPOEIRA.
 CAPO-WHAT?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.805
OH,
IT'S A BRAZILIAN MARTIAL ART

20:05.805 --> 20:07.537
THAT INCORPORATES DANCE.

20:07.537 --> 20:09.509
YEAH, 'CAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING SCARIER

20:09.509 --> 20:13.513
THAN A GUY COMING AT YA
WITH JAZZ HANDS.
 THAT'S FUNNY, BUT ACTUALLY,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.715
THE DANCE PART'S TO
CATCH YOUR OPPONENT OFF GUARD.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.718
LIKE THAT?
 NO, THERE'S
A LITTLE MORE NUANCE TO IT.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
OOH!
 LIKE THAT.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.792
WHERE'S THE "DANCE" PART?
 (grunts)

20:22.792 --> 20:25.255
OH! (laughs)
 THERE IT IS, GINGER!

20:25.255 --> 20:28.598
YOU KNOW WHAT, BOYS?
NOT IN THE HOUSE.

20:29.699 --> 20:34.404
OH, MY GOD!

20:34.404 --> 20:36.406
GIVE IT BACK! IT'S MY BALL!
 IT'S MY BALL NOW.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.538
HEY! YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.542
OH! HONEY!

20:42.542 --> 20:45.445
IS THAT WHO'S BEEN
PICKING ON YOU? JUANITA SOLIS?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.776
UH-HUH.

20:46.776 --> 20:49.379
WELL, SHE IS GOING TO GET
A BIG SURPRISE,

20:49.379 --> 20:50.880
BECAUSE YOUR DADDY

20:50.880 --> 20:53.553
IS ABOUT TO TURN YOU
INTO A KILLING MACHINE.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.456
UH, M.J., CAN I TALK
TO YOUR MOM FOR A SECOND?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.388
MM-HMM.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.932
WHAT?

21:02.932 --> 21:04.964
I CAN'T TEACH HIM
TO HIT A GIRL.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.467
THAT'S NOT JUST ANY GIRL.
YOU SAW HER.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.569
SHE COULD TAKE DOWN
A SMALL DEER.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.401
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:11.401 --> 21:13.403
IF IT WEARS A SKIRT,
IT'S OFF-LIMITS.

21:13.403 --> 21:14.704
THAT IS SEXIST.

21:14.704 --> 21:17.407
IF FEMINISM MEANS ANYTHING,
IT'S THAT IT'S OKAY

21:17.407 --> 21:19.649
FOR A BIG, MEAN GIRL
TO GET HER BUTT KICKED.

21:19.649 --> 21:21.381
YOU, TEACH HIM

21:21.381 --> 21:23.813
ONE OF THOSE BRAZILIAN
KUNG FU CHA-CHA THINGS.

21:23.813 --> 21:25.655
I'M WITH MIKE.

21:25.655 --> 21:27.987
YOU CAN'T HIT GIRLS.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.390
AH! COUPLE OF WUSSES.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.061
I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.066
OOPS!
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

21:37.066 --> 21:40.330
JUST FOR THAT, I'M BREAKING
MY RULE ABOUT NOT HITTING GIRLS.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.033
GABY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

21:44.033 --> 21:46.636
I JUST SAW JUANITA
PUSH M.J. DOWN.

21:46.636 --> 21:47.977
REALLY?

21:47.977 --> 21:49.038
REALLY.

21:49.038 --> 21:52.442
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.
JUANITA'S BEEN BULLYING HIM.

21:52.442 --> 21:55.314
WOW. I'M SORRY.
I'LL TALK TO HER.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.686
(sighs) THANK YOU.

21:56.686 --> 21:59.819
AND DON'T WORRY. NO ONE WILL
HEAR ABOUT THIS FROM ME.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.051
HEAR WHAT?

22:02.051 --> 22:04.394
THAT M.J.'s GETTING BEAT UP
BY A LITTLE GIRL.

22:04.394 --> 22:06.556
WELL...

22:06.556 --> 22:07.927
A GIRL.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.099
ARE YOU SUGGESTING

22:10.099 --> 22:12.602
THAT JUANITA
IS FAT FOR HER AGE?

22:12.602 --> 22:15.104
GABY, JUANITA'S FAT
FOR YOUR AGE.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.066
(scoffs) YEAH?
WELL, LET'S FACE IT.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.908
M.J. COULD GET BEATEN UP
BY A KITTEN.

22:18.908 --> 22:20.570
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:20.570 --> 22:23.573
MAYBE YOU COULD
TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER

22:23.573 --> 22:27.377
HOW TO USE HER WORDS
AND NOT HER FISTS.

22:27.377 --> 22:30.980
YEAH? OR MAYBE YOU COULD
TEACH YOUR SON TO GROW A PAIR!

22:32.552 --> 22:34.353
UGH!

22:34.353 --> 22:37.356
(children laughing and shouting)

22:40.490 --> 22:41.961
WHAT YOU LOOKING AT?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.434
OH, JUST SOME OLD PICTURES.

22:44.434 --> 22:46.936
CAN YOU GUESS
WHO THAT LITTLE GIRL IS?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.773
THAT'S YOUR MOM WAY BACK
WHEN SHE WAS YOUR AGE.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.505
WHAT'S SHE EATING?

22:55.505 --> 22:57.947
OH! UH, A HOT DOG.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.849
NO WAY.

22:59.849 --> 23:02.151
OH, YES.
YOUR MOTHER LOVED HOT DOGS.

23:02.151 --> 23:04.884
EVERY DAY AT LUNCHTIME,
SHE'D SAY TO ME,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.886
"MOMMY, I WANT A HOT DOG."

23:06.886 --> 23:09.789
HOW COME
SHE DOESN'T EAT THEM NOW?

23:09.789 --> 23:11.791
WELL, BECAUSE
SHE'S ALL GROWN-UP.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.763
YOU SEE,
HOT DOGS AND HAMBURGERS

23:13.763 --> 23:15.765
ARE WHAT MAKE
LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS

23:15.765 --> 23:17.767
GROW UP TO BE
BIG AND STRONG.

23:17.767 --> 23:20.800
AND NOW THAT SHE'S GROWN-UP,
SHE DOESN'T NEED THEM ANYMORE.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.102
DOESN'T MOMMY WANT ME
 TO BE BIG AND STRONG?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.935
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF THAT
ALL DAY.

23:25.935 --> 23:28.578
MAYBE SHE'S AFRAID
IF YOU GET BIG,

23:28.578 --> 23:31.641
YOU'LL LEAVE HOME
AND GO PLAY FOR THE RED SOX.

23:31.641 --> 23:35.485
BUT I WANT TO GET BIG.
I WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL.

23:35.485 --> 23:38.087
OH. WELL...

23:38.087 --> 23:39.749
IN THAT CASE...

23:43.853 --> 23:45.755
CAN I?

23:45.755 --> 23:48.598
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL YOUR MOMMY.

23:48.598 --> 23:49.959
OKAY.

23:54.764 --> 23:57.767
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

23:57.767 --> 23:59.969
IT'S LIKE TOFU,
ONLY BETTER.

23:59.969 --> 24:02.642
YES.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.874
YES, IT IS.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.224
TWO, THREE, FOUR!

24:15.224 --> 24:18.928
(playing "Smoke on the Water")

24:18.928 --> 24:23.132
WHEN TOM SCAVO THREW HIMSELF
INTO HIS NEW HOBBY...

24:23.132 --> 24:25.164
♪♪♪

24:25.164 --> 24:26.666
HIS WIFE TOLD HERSELF

24:26.666 --> 24:29.939
IT WAS A PHASE,
AND IT WOULD PASS QUICKLY.

24:29.939 --> 24:32.702
♪♪♪

24:32.702 --> 24:36.105
BUT THREE HOURS LATER,
SHE REALIZED

24:36.105 --> 24:39.909
IT COULD NOT
PASS QUICKLY ENOUGH.

24:42.211 --> 24:44.213
SO LYNETTE BEGAN TO PLOT

24:44.213 --> 24:47.987
AGAINST HER HUSBAND'S
INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.661
(gasps)
OOH! CAREFUL, HONEY.

24:51.661 --> 24:52.792
SORRY.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.264
YOU COULD BREAK
YOUR DAD'S GUITAR AND...

24:55.264 --> 24:58.968
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
HER DAUGHTER

24:58.968 --> 25:03.272
PROVIDED HER AN IDEA
FOR A... SIMPLE ACCIDENT...

25:05.104 --> 25:08.838
AND... A CLEAN ALIBI.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.514
(car approaching)

25:15.514 --> 25:17.086
(loud crunch, brakes screech)

25:17.086 --> 25:18.918
(Tom) DAMN IT!

25:18.918 --> 25:21.090
(car door opens and slams)

25:21.090 --> 25:23.252
HEY, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
OH, MY!

25:23.252 --> 25:25.224
IT WAS LYING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR!

25:25.224 --> 25:28.728
HOW IN THE WORLD
DID THAT HAPPEN?
 HAS PENNY BEEN PLAYING
IN HERE AGAIN?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.700
I'VE TOLD HER
A MILLION TIMES!

25:30.700 --> 25:33.302
NOW I'M SURE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
TOM. PLEASE DON'T YELL AT HER.

25:33.302 --> 25:35.534
THIS WAS A $1,600 BASS.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.137
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO REPLACE IT.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.169
PENNY LYNN SCAVO!

25:40.169 --> 25:41.741
WHERE IS SHE?

25:41.741 --> 25:44.974
OH, TOM!

25:44.974 --> 25:47.316
SHE'S UP IN HER ROOM.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.155
I'M GONNA GO PLAY OUTSIDE.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.928
OH! WAIT.
YOUR FORGOT YOUR WHISTLE.

25:58.928 --> 26:00.259
OKAY, SWEETIE.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.662
THIS IS JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE.

26:02.662 --> 26:06.095
IF JUANITA COMES AROUND,
YOU JUST BLOW IT.

26:06.095 --> 26:08.267
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
 OKAY.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.969
GOOD BOY.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.270
(door opens and shuts)

26:18.107 --> 26:20.079
(whistle tweets)

26:20.079 --> 26:21.050
OH!

26:21.050 --> 26:23.983
(whistle tweets)
 HEY, GIVE ME BACK MY WHISTLE!

26:23.983 --> 26:29.018
(blowing whistle)
 JUANITA SOLIS, DON'T YOU MOVE!
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!

26:30.860 --> 26:32.591
WHAT'S ON YOUR HEAD?

26:32.591 --> 26:33.993
NEVER MIND.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.095
WHAT DID YOU DO TO M.J.?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.597
HE WOULDN'T LET ME
BLOW HIS WHISTLE.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.930
SO YOUR SOLUTION
WAS TO PUSH HIM DOWN?

26:40.930 --> 26:42.902
DO YOU THINK THAT'S NICE?

26:42.902 --> 26:46.175
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF SOMEONE DID THAT TO YOU?
 I WOULDN'T CARE.

26:46.175 --> 26:48.908
OH, REALLY?
YOU DON'T THINK IT WOULD HURT?

26:48.908 --> 26:50.379
EVEN IF IT DID...

26:50.379 --> 26:54.043
(whines) I'M NOT A CRYBABY
LIKE M.J.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.348
(gasps)

26:59.348 --> 27:01.791
I'M SORRY.

27:01.791 --> 27:05.024
JUANITA, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO SEE HOW IT FELT.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.856
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:06.856 --> 27:08.357
SUSAN, I SAW THAT!

27:08.357 --> 27:10.359
KIDS, GET INSIDE!

27:10.359 --> 27:13.062
OKAY, FIRST OFF,
IT WASN'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKED.

27:13.062 --> 27:15.735
REALLY? 'CAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU BODY-SLAMMED MY DAUGHTER.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.668
I BARELY TAPPED HER.
SHE WAS MILKING IT.

27:18.668 --> 27:21.640
THAT'S YOUR DEFENSE? YOU WERE
ONLY ASSAULTING HER "A LITTLE"?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.013
I WAS TRYING TO TEACH HER
NOT TO BE A BULLY--

27:24.013 --> 27:26.676
SOMETHING SHE SHOULD HAVE
LEARNED FROM HER MOTHER.

27:26.676 --> 27:29.679
WELL, I'M SORRY. I WAS TOO BUSY
TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HER

27:29.679 --> 27:32.922
WHY M.J. DOESN'T WEAR A DRESS
LIKE ALL THE OTHER LITTLE GIRLS.

27:32.922 --> 27:34.724
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

27:34.724 --> 27:37.727
TELL BOB AND LEE THAT I'LL PAY
FOR THE DENT IN THEIR LAWN.

27:38.888 --> 27:40.259
OH!

27:40.259 --> 27:42.091
YOU DID NOT!

27:42.091 --> 27:43.993
I DID.

27:43.993 --> 27:45.765
(sighs)

27:45.765 --> 27:47.666
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.299
WE'VE BOTH BEEN
INCREDIBLY CHILDISH HERE,

27:50.299 --> 27:53.072
AND IT IS TIME ONE OF US
TOOK THE HIGH ROAD,

27:53.072 --> 27:55.144
SO I AM NOW
GOING TO WALK AWAY.

27:55.144 --> 27:57.146
PLEASE TAKE NOTE
OF THIS CONFLICT RESOLUTION

27:57.146 --> 28:00.149
AND TRY TO PASS THE LESSON
ON TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

28:00.149 --> 28:02.852
YOU CAN DYE THAT HAIR
ALL YOU WANT,

28:02.852 --> 28:06.455
BUT THE GRAY'S
JUST GONNA KEEP COMING.

28:06.455 --> 28:10.720
(both grunting)

28:15.364 --> 28:18.728
AND THEY CALL ME WHITE TRASH.

28:23.472 --> 28:24.834
HEY.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.737
YOU GOT A MINUTE?
 YEAH. SURE. COME ON IN.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.181
I, UH, I HEARD THERE WAS
A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

28:32.181 --> 28:33.342
OH.

28:33.342 --> 28:34.844
SO...

28:34.844 --> 28:37.216
I GOT THIS FOR TOM.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.488
YOU BOUGHT TOM A NEW BASS?

28:39.488 --> 28:42.321
IT'S NOT AS SMOOTH
AS HIS OLD ONE, BUT IT'S GOOD.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.754
WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

28:44.754 --> 28:47.356
IT'S MOSTLY SELFISH ON MY PART.
I WAS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN.

28:47.356 --> 28:48.828
WELL, SORRY.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.330
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD
GO SKATEBOARDING WITH ORSON.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.763
ALL RIGHT.

28:53.763 --> 28:56.205
FORGET ABOUT ME.

28:56.205 --> 28:57.867
TOM WAS HAVING FUN.

28:57.867 --> 29:00.870
AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
HE NEEDS IT.

29:00.870 --> 29:02.942
UH-HUH.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.945
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT MY HUSBAND NEEDS?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.447
JUST SOMETHING THAT I SAW
THE OTHER DAY,

29:08.447 --> 29:11.350
WHEN YOU WERE MAKING HIM
GET RID OF ALL HIS THINGS.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.282
YOU MEAN HIS JUNK?

29:13.282 --> 29:15.284
IT MAY BE JUNK TO YOU,

29:15.284 --> 29:17.156
BUT TO TOM...

29:17.156 --> 29:20.159
WELL, THAT WAS STUFF
HE WAS GONNA GET AROUND TO.

29:22.331 --> 29:25.434
YOU KNOW WHAT
A MIDLIFE CRISIS IS?

29:25.434 --> 29:27.897
I'M MARRIED TO A 45-YEAR-OLD MAN
WHO HAS A RED CONVERTIBLE.

29:27.897 --> 29:29.899
YEAH, I THINK I KNOW.

29:29.899 --> 29:34.103
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT HAPPENS?
A MAN GETS TO A CERTAIN AGE,

29:34.103 --> 29:39.278
AND HE REALIZES...
HE'S GONNA DIE SOMEDAY.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.409
REALLY DIE.

29:40.409 --> 29:46.455
AND WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT HE'S
EVERYTHING HE'S EVER GONNA BE.

29:46.455 --> 29:50.259
HE'S NEVER GONNA BE RICH.

29:50.259 --> 29:52.261
HE'S NEVER GONNA
CLIMB A MOUNTAIN.

29:53.923 --> 29:56.966
NOW SOME GUYS DO BAD THINGS

29:56.966 --> 29:59.829
WHEN THEY GET THOSE THOUGHTS
IN THEIR HEADS.

29:59.829 --> 30:01.330
BY COMPARISON,

30:01.330 --> 30:03.933
PLAYING IN A GARAGE BAND--
WELL...

30:03.933 --> 30:06.005
IT SEEMS PRETTY HARMLESS.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.840
AH.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.312
SO... NOW MY MARRIAGE
IS IN TROUBLE,

30:13.312 --> 30:16.315
AND YOU'RE GONNA SAVE IT
BY GIVING TOM A BASS?

30:16.315 --> 30:20.289
NO. NO. I'M NOT.

30:22.251 --> 30:24.924
YOU ARE.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.916
(classical music playing)

30:46.916 --> 30:49.879
MOST OF THE GUYS IN MY CLASS
WENT INTO CORPORATE LAW,

30:49.879 --> 30:51.881
BUT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

30:51.881 --> 30:53.282
THAT WOULD INFLUENCE
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

30:53.282 --> 30:55.284
THAT'S HOW HE ENDED UP
AT THE E.P.A.

30:55.284 --> 30:57.386
OH. HMM.

31:01.130 --> 31:05.064
SO, LEO,
WHERE DID YOU STUDY LAW?

31:05.064 --> 31:06.195
CORNELL.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.067
NOW I'M JEALOUS.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.099
I ALWAYS WISHED THAT I'D GONE
TO A SCHOOL LIKE CORNELL.

31:10.099 --> 31:12.401
BUT... IT JUST WASN'T
IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

31:12.401 --> 31:14.243
HOW ABOUT YOU, DAVE?

31:14.243 --> 31:17.176
ME? NO.
WASN'T IN MY CARDS, EITHER.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.877
SO WHERE DID YOU GO?

31:18.877 --> 31:22.051
AFTER LISTENING TO LEO,
I'D BE EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU.

31:22.051 --> 31:23.052
SO... E.P.A.

31:23.052 --> 31:25.514
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
ON GLOBAL WARMING--

31:25.514 --> 31:27.116
FACT OR FICTION?

31:27.116 --> 31:28.617
HOLD ON, DARLING.

31:28.617 --> 31:30.619
MRS. McCLUSKEY
ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

31:30.619 --> 31:33.062
TELL HER
WHERE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL.

31:36.966 --> 31:40.229
OH, EDIE, I THINK SHE WAS
JUST MAKING CONVERSATION. SO--

31:40.229 --> 31:43.172
OKAY, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHERE YOU WENT?

31:43.172 --> 31:45.174
AFTER ALL, I AM YOUR WIFE.
SHOULDN'T I KNOW?

31:53.682 --> 31:57.216
ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

32:00.149 --> 32:02.651
I TOOK A JOB
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

32:02.651 --> 32:05.424
BECAUSE MY FAMILY
WAS HAVING A HARD TIME.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.928
NOT HAVING A DEGREE
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS

32:09.928 --> 32:11.430
BEEN EMBARRASSING TO ME,

32:11.430 --> 32:14.363
ESPECIALLY WHEN
I'M WITH PEOPLE WHO DO.

32:19.368 --> 32:21.370
SO, MY DARLING,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

32:21.370 --> 32:23.372
YOU'D LIKE TO QUIZ ME ABOUT
IN PUBLIC?

32:23.372 --> 32:25.374
MY... CHILDHOOD STUTTERING?

32:25.374 --> 32:27.646
MY DAD'S DRINKING PROBLEMS?

32:31.620 --> 32:35.084
NO. I'M... GOOD.

32:36.625 --> 32:38.657
(doorbell rings)

32:40.459 --> 32:42.661
I CAME TO SAY I'M SORRY.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.164
YOU ATTACKED MY CHILD
AND THEN ME.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.666
WHY SHOULD I EVEN
LISTEN TO YOU?

32:47.666 --> 32:49.598
I BROUGHT BOOZE.

32:49.598 --> 32:51.970
COME ON IN.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.305
LIKE, I HAVE THIS RULE--

32:56.305 --> 32:57.976
NO TOY GUNS.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.709
EXCEPT EVERYTHING
 THAT M.J. PICKS UP--

33:00.709 --> 33:04.353
WHETHER IT'S A HAIRBRUSH,
A HANGER, EVERYTHING--

33:04.353 --> 33:07.686
HE PRETENDS IT'S A GUN.
 WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE'S A BOY.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.588
THAT'S MY POINT!

33:09.588 --> 33:11.620
I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT RAISING BOYS.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.323
AND I THINK M.J.
HAS FIGURED THIS OUT,

33:14.323 --> 33:17.466
SO HE GOES STRAIGHT TO MIKE
WHENEVER THERE'S A PROBLEM.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.568
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
MIKE'S A GREAT DAD.

33:19.568 --> 33:23.072
YEAH, SURE,
ON ALTERNATE WEEKENDS.

33:23.072 --> 33:25.174
THAT'S FINE...

33:25.174 --> 33:27.476
UNTIL... (sighs)
M.J. NEEDS HIS DADDY,

33:27.476 --> 33:29.438
AND HIS DADDY'S NOT THERE.

33:29.438 --> 33:33.382
SUSAN, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.444
WELL, WE SPLIT UP,

33:35.444 --> 33:38.447
SO IT'S AT LEAST HALF MY FAULT
ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT.

33:38.447 --> 33:41.450
WELL, IF IT'S
ANY CONSOLATION,

33:41.450 --> 33:44.593
CARLOS IS A HANDS-ON,
FULL-TIME DAD,

33:44.593 --> 33:47.496
AND I STILL FEEL LIKE
I'M NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE,

33:47.496 --> 33:50.359
LIKE... I'M NOT
PREPARING THEM ENOUGH.

33:50.359 --> 33:53.402
PREPARING THEM FOR WHAT?

33:53.402 --> 33:55.404
FOR HOW HARD LIFE IS.

33:55.404 --> 33:57.406
I MEAN, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

33:57.406 --> 33:59.408
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
JUANITA WAS BULLYING M.J.,

33:59.408 --> 34:01.410
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS,
THANK GOD!

34:01.410 --> 34:03.342
LET HER DO THE PUSHING,

34:03.342 --> 34:05.644
JUST AS LONG
AS SHE'S NOT A VICTIM.

34:05.644 --> 34:09.318
WELL, I DON'T SEE
ANY KID OF YOURS BEING A VICTIM.

34:09.318 --> 34:12.150
(laughs) YOU'RE
THE STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW.

34:14.483 --> 34:17.386
I USED TO BE.

34:17.386 --> 34:18.627
(sighs deeply)

34:18.627 --> 34:20.629
LOOK AT MY LIFE, SUSAN.

34:20.629 --> 34:23.092
I...

34:23.092 --> 34:25.393
I'VE BEEN BEATEN DOWN.

34:27.295 --> 34:29.598
WELL, I THOUGHT
I HAD YOU BEATEN TODAY,

34:29.598 --> 34:32.601
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS EATING GRASS.

34:32.601 --> 34:35.204
(chuckles)

34:35.204 --> 34:38.076
TODAY DOESN'T COUNT.
TODAY I WAS MAD.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.309
WELL...

34:40.309 --> 34:42.610
MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET MAD
MORE OFTEN.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.757
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.819
THIS IS NICE.

34:50.819 --> 34:53.091
WE SHOULD RUMBLE
ALL THE TIME.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.393
(both laugh)

34:54.393 --> 34:57.266
TO SUSAN MAYER--

34:57.266 --> 34:58.597
GOOD MOM.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.829
TO GABRIELLE SOLIS--

35:00.829 --> 35:02.501
ANOTHER GOOD MOM.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.333
(clink)

35:04.333 --> 35:06.735
(Juanita) MOMMY, WE'RE HUNGRY!

35:06.735 --> 35:11.140
SO?! THERE'S WAFFLES
IN THE FREEZER!

35:11.140 --> 35:15.184
AND GET MOMMY SOME ICE!

35:16.515 --> 35:18.187
ISN'T THIS NICE?

35:18.187 --> 35:20.189
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS,

35:20.189 --> 35:22.591
MY FAMILY IS ALL HERE
UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

35:22.591 --> 35:25.294
HERE'S TO MANY MORE MEALS
TOGETHER.

35:25.294 --> 35:27.456
YES.
 (Edie) AW. WELCOME HOME.
CHEERS.

35:27.456 --> 35:29.158
(glasses clink)

35:29.158 --> 35:31.160
I DON'T FEEL GOOD, DANIELLE.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.901
(under breath) "DANIELLE"?
 (grunts)

35:32.901 --> 35:37.266
I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.
 LET'S GET YOU
TO THE POWDER ROOM.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.340
(vomits)

35:43.342 --> 35:45.344
HERE WE ARE--

35:45.344 --> 35:47.476
MUSHROOM RISOTTO.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.878
THERE'S AN UNFORTUNATE
COINCIDENCE.

35:49.878 --> 35:52.421
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

35:52.421 --> 35:54.923
NO, UM, YOU TAKE BENJY UPSTAIRS.
I'LL GET IT.

35:54.923 --> 35:58.827
ORSON, COULD YOU GET THE MOP,
PLEASE?

36:00.589 --> 36:02.891
OH, MY GOD. IS THAT MEAT?

36:02.891 --> 36:04.433
NO!

36:04.433 --> 36:06.164
OF COURSE NOT.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.166
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE MEAT
TO YOU?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.369
IT'S... HARD TO TELL.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.770
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

36:11.770 --> 36:13.772
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO THROW UP
IS A WESTERN OMELET.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.804
THAT IS NOT MEAT. (chuckles)

36:15.804 --> 36:18.547
THAT PIECE RIGHT THERE--
THAT'S DEFINITELY MEAT!

36:18.547 --> 36:20.449
STILL WAITING ON THAT MOP.

36:20.449 --> 36:22.551
(scoffs) WHAT DID GRANDMA
GIVE YOU TO EAT?

36:22.551 --> 36:24.553
(weakly)
SHE SAID NOT TO TELL.

36:28.817 --> 36:31.720
YOU GAVE HIM MEAT
AND THEN TOLD HIM TO LIE?!

36:33.722 --> 36:36.425
I GAVE HIM A HOT DOG,
ALL RIGHT?

36:36.425 --> 36:38.767
HE LIKED IT SO MUCH,
HE ASKED FOR ANOTHER.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.669
TWO HOT DOGS?
 (scoffs)

36:40.669 --> 36:41.770
ALL RIGHT,

36:41.770 --> 36:44.903
I'LL CONCEDE THE SECOND ONE
WAS CLEARLY A MISTAKE.

36:46.235 --> 36:48.507
COME ON, LEO.
WE'RE LEAVING.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.240
NO! DANIELLE, PLEASE.
 I'M SORRY, ORSON.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.742
SHE'S MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR US TO STAY IN THIS HOUSE.

36:53.742 --> 36:56.785
(Orson) DANIELLE, WAIT, WAIT.

36:59.648 --> 37:02.421
WELL, WE CAN STILL DRINK,
RIGHT?

37:02.421 --> 37:05.354
OH, YEAH.

37:07.356 --> 37:09.658
WELL, I'VE APOLOGIZED
TILL I'M BLUE IN THE FACE,

37:09.658 --> 37:12.931
BUT THEY'RE STILL LEAVING
IN THE MORNING.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.465
(sighs deeply)

37:16.465 --> 37:18.767
NOW YOU'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO ME, EITHER?

37:20.669 --> 37:22.341
THEY'RE JUST MAD.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.813
THINGS WILL BE BETTER
NEXT TIME.

37:24.813 --> 37:27.516
YOU HONESTLY THINK
THERE'LL BE A NEXT TIME?

37:27.516 --> 37:30.519
IT TOOK US THREE YEARS
TO TALK THEM INTO THIS VISIT.

37:30.519 --> 37:32.250
IT TOOK YOU ONE DAY...
 (pot clanks)

37:32.250 --> 37:33.752
TO RUIN IT.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.685
ORSON, I'M TRULY SORRY.

37:36.685 --> 37:38.587
IT'S JUST, SEEING...

37:38.587 --> 37:40.959
ALL THESE MISTAKES
THAT SHE'S MAKING WITH BENJAMIN,

37:40.959 --> 37:42.961
IT'S JUST SO HARD FOR ME.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.534
(voice breaks)
YOU KNOW WHAT HARD FOR ME?

37:47.536 --> 37:49.498
WHEN I LEFT FOR PRISON,

37:49.498 --> 37:53.572
BENJAMIN WAS IN MY HOUSE,
HE WAS IN MY LIFE.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.874
HE CALLED ME "DADDY."

37:55.874 --> 37:59.408
AND WHEN I CAME HOME,
HE WAS GONE.

38:01.350 --> 38:03.512
AND YOU THINK
THAT'S MY FAULT?

38:03.512 --> 38:05.784
YES, I DO.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.657
ORSON, YOU WEREN'T HERE.

38:08.657 --> 38:12.361
SHE CAME BACK.
SHE WAS MARRIED TO A LAWYER.

38:12.361 --> 38:14.963
AND DON'T FORGET,
SHE IS HIS MOTHER!

38:14.963 --> 38:16.965
I TRIED TO FIGHT, BUT--

38:16.965 --> 38:19.728
YOU SHOULD'VE FOUGHT HARDER.

38:19.728 --> 38:22.431
I WAS ON MY KNEES.
I WAS SOBBING.

38:22.431 --> 38:25.604
SHE SAID "NO" AND THEN
RIPPED HIM OUT OF MY ARMS.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.677
(whispers) YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO SAY THAT TO ME.

38:47.356 --> 38:49.628
YOU KIND OF BLINDSIDED ME
TONIGHT.

38:49.628 --> 38:53.662
I KNOW. I AM SO SORRY.

38:56.365 --> 38:58.767
I WAS CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.470
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU KEPT PRESSING ME.

39:03.572 --> 39:06.845
HONESTLY, IT WAS ALL
KAREN McCLUSKEY'S FAULT.

39:08.677 --> 39:10.379
REALLY? HOW SO?

39:10.379 --> 39:13.522
WELL, SHE KEPT ASKING ME ALL
THIS STUFF ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND

39:13.522 --> 39:16.525
AND WHY I DON'T KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOU, AND... (sighs)

39:16.525 --> 39:20.389
I SHOULD'VE JUST NEVER
LET HER GET TO ME.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.634
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.035
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.142
KIND OF SAD
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

39:34.142 --> 39:37.105
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 OH... MAYBE YOU GUYS
DON'T NOTICE

39:37.105 --> 39:39.107
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO USED TO HER.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.382
BUT HER BEHAVIOR
REMINDS ME OF MY GRANDMOTHER,

39:44.382 --> 39:46.384
WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED TO NOTICE...

39:46.384 --> 39:48.457
THE DEMENTIA, THAT IS.

39:48.457 --> 39:51.019
YOU THINK KAREN'S
GOING SENILE?

39:51.019 --> 39:55.494
I REMEMBER
MY POOR GRANDMOTHER...

39:55.494 --> 39:58.767
STARTED GETTING SO PARANOID.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.970
SHE THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE
BREAKING INTO HER HOUSE AND...

40:01.970 --> 40:04.773
STEALING HER THINGS.

40:04.773 --> 40:07.075
WE FINALLY
HAD TO PUT HER IN A HOME.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.941
I JUST HOPE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO KAREN.

40:27.896 --> 40:30.098
I WANT MY 300 BUCKS.

40:30.098 --> 40:33.732
I TOLD YOU. IT'S YOUR CAR.
YOU DEAL WITH IT.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.734
THAT'S IT? NO COMPASSION?

40:35.734 --> 40:39.007
NO, "HEY, LET'S SPLIT THE BILL
AND CALL IT EVEN"?

40:39.007 --> 40:42.010
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
YOU'RE NOT LOSING 300 BUCKS.

40:42.010 --> 40:45.113
YOU'RE GAINING
A VALUABLE LESSON--BUYER BEWARE.

40:45.113 --> 40:48.977
TRUE. NOW HERE'S
A VALUABLE LESSON FOR YOU.

40:54.222 --> 40:56.625
(revs engine, brakes screech)

40:56.625 --> 40:58.627
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY! HEY!

40:58.627 --> 41:01.229
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
 GIVE ME MY MONEY,

41:01.229 --> 41:03.862
OR NEXT TIME
WE'RE TRADING PAINT.
 YOU'RE BLUFFING.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.864
I AM TIRED OF BEING A VICTIM,
ANDREW.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.196
AND TRUST ME,
THAT IS NO BLUFF.
 (tires squeak)

41:08.196 --> 41:12.971
(brakes screech)
 HEY! YOU--YOU TOUCH MY CAR,
AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.674
LUCKILY, I'M INSURED. (gasps)
OH, WAIT. OUR POLICY LAPSED.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.576
HOPE YOU'VE GOT
GOOD COVERAGE.

41:17.576 --> 41:20.709
(revving engine)

41:20.709 --> 41:23.552
WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!
WAIT, WAIT.

41:23.552 --> 41:25.013
I'LL GET MY CHECKBOOK.

41:25.013 --> 41:28.517
I PREFER CASH.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.792
BULLIES...

41:33.792 --> 41:37.566
ANY ADULT WILL TELL YOU
THE PLAYGROUND

41:37.566 --> 41:41.129
IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE
TO FIND THEM.

41:41.129 --> 41:44.933
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,
YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE UNCONCERNED

41:44.933 --> 41:48.777
OR UNAWARE
OF THE PAIN THEY INFLICT.

41:48.777 --> 41:51.810
IT MIGHT BE A NEIGHBOR

41:51.810 --> 41:54.783
PREYING ON THE SUSPICIONS
OF HER FRIEND...

41:56.545 --> 41:57.846
OR A DAUGHTER

41:57.846 --> 42:01.249
PUNISHING THE CHOICES
OF HER MOTHER.

42:04.923 --> 42:08.256
OR A HOUSEWIFE SEEKING JUSTICE

42:08.256 --> 42:11.900
FROM THE MAN WHO SOLD HER
A CAR.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.032
YES...

42:14.032 --> 42:16.635
THERE ARE BULLIES EVERYWHERE.

42:16.635 --> 42:20.939
AND THE WORST ARE THE ONES
WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU

42:20.939 --> 42:24.613
WITHOUT YOU EVER KNOWING...

42:24.613 --> 42:26.945
WHAT THEY'VE DONE.
