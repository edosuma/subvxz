WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.501
Previously on Legacies...

00:01.501 --> 00:02.936
You know, I opened this school
to protect these kids.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.404
How am I supposed
to protect them

00:04.404 --> 00:07.708
from stuff
that's not supposed to exist?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.376
DORIAN: The monsters come
one at a time.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.844
I found myself
not far from here

00:10.844 --> 00:12.679
with an urge to
possess that knife.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.915
And who told you to do this?
A voice in my mind.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.350
MG:
You think he'll go for her?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.251
Probably.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.052
They usually do.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.255
JOSIE: Lizzie has dibs.
HOPE: On Rafael?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.356
She always calls dibs.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.957
When's it gonna be your turn?

00:23.957 --> 00:26.226
We're here to discuss if Landon
should be allowed to stay

00:26.226 --> 00:27.294
at the school.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.462
Landon has to go.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.913
ALARIC: I know what you're doing
is important, Caroline.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.048
But how do I tell the girls
that their mom

00:48.048 --> 00:50.450
isn't gonna be there
for their 16th birthday?

00:50.450 --> 00:53.720
I can't exactly tell them
what you're really involved in.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.933
No.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.902
I-I am nowhere near
cracking this case.

01:08.902 --> 01:13.006
I have a knife, I have a symbol,
I have a place, sort of,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.574
but I don't know
what any of it means,

01:14.574 --> 01:16.009
a-and I don't know
what's connecting it,

01:16.009 --> 01:18.078
and I don't know
what monster is coming next.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.179
Ric?

01:25.619 --> 01:28.021
I've got to call you back.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.459
ALARIC:
Dorian!

01:35.429 --> 01:37.297
DORIAN:
Are you okay?

01:37.297 --> 01:39.266
Whoa, whoa.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.601
Ric, if you could just put down
the crossbow.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.937
My freak-out level
is about 11 right now.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.305
You know her?

01:45.305 --> 01:47.140
I know who she's supposed to be.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.842
Who?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.211
The love of my life.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.214
♪ ♪

01:58.352 --> 02:00.354
JO:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.822
Wait.
Hold up. Hold...

02:01.822 --> 02:04.558
hold up, Ric.
Listen to Dorian.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.193
Are you Dorian?
Yeah.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.494
I'm Jo.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.695
You're his dead wife?

02:08.695 --> 02:11.131
I m-- I mean fiancée.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.633
I mean, uh...

02:12.633 --> 02:15.002
You don't think
she's actually...?
No, I don't.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.503
Did you see how she got here?

02:16.503 --> 02:17.838
I was sort of, um...

02:17.838 --> 02:20.841
yanked awake
and then I was just here.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.309
:
Nothing suspicious about that.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.343
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.511
Kill her now before she attacks?

02:24.511 --> 02:25.712
Wait, what?
I-I...

02:25.712 --> 02:27.080
I was more,
"Let's interrogate her."

02:27.080 --> 02:29.349
Because if she's
the next monster,

02:29.349 --> 02:31.685
then maybe she would know more
than the dryad did.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.923
What?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.428
Okay, but no one sees her.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.231
Especially today.
Good idea.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.666
I need Emma.

02:48.368 --> 02:51.538
HOPE: Obviously, nothing's
gonna come out of it.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.273
I mean,
I may never see him again.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.841
And nobody wants a phone thing.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.377
Though I do like the sound
of his voice. It's low

02:57.377 --> 02:59.613
and smart-sounding
and kind of soothing.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.349
And his eyes-- his eyes are,
like, this green-gray color

03:02.349 --> 03:04.017
that's not really a color,
you know?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.386
Like, they're green when
he wears green, and then...

03:06.386 --> 03:08.355
Oh, my God. Who am I right now?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.091
A normal teenager?

03:11.091 --> 03:13.393
Though I do love hearing
you talk about something

03:13.393 --> 03:15.729
as simple as having a crush
on a boy.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.899
You do not need
a counselor, Hope.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.567
You need a friend.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.602
RAFAEL: All right, let's get
the rest of these chairs

03:22.602 --> 03:24.271
and tables
and get 'em out of here.

03:24.271 --> 03:25.572
All right?

03:25.572 --> 03:28.308
Let's go, let's go.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.877
Perks of being an alpha.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.913
Bunch of people
you get to boss around.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.614
More like a bunch of shadows

03:34.614 --> 03:36.116
waiting to be told what to do.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.919
Who put you on party duty?

03:38.919 --> 03:42.089
I volunteered. What do
you want? I'm busy.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.924
Listen, Raf,
I know you're mad at me

03:43.924 --> 03:46.093
for sending Landon away, but...

03:47.727 --> 03:49.729
I promise you,
it was for his own good.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.897
You've known him
for two minutes,

03:50.897 --> 03:52.232
and you know what's good
for him?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.633
I know that I want him
to be safe.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.503
Listen, Raf,
I just came here to apologize.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.004
And I thought maybe if...

03:58.004 --> 04:01.308
I don't know, if you needed
someone to talk to...

04:02.676 --> 04:04.344
Whatever.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.019
Actually, um...

04:13.019 --> 04:15.455
I do kind of need help
with something.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.190
There's no fancy parties

04:17.190 --> 04:19.192
in grand ballrooms
where I come from.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.428
I need to know
what to expect for tonight.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.996
I don't want to let Lizzie down.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.633
Who cares what
Lizzie Saltzman thinks?
I do.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.635
I'm her date.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.809
Hey. I didn't see you

04:35.809 --> 04:37.511
at breakfast.
I'm too excited to eat.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.812
Happy birthday to us.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.548
Isn't it a beautiful day
for a party?

04:41.548 --> 04:42.983
You're... cheerful.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.318
Why wouldn't I be?
Mom's coming home,

04:45.318 --> 04:47.821
I had sex with Raf, my pores
are practically invisible...

04:47.821 --> 04:50.056
Wait, what?

04:50.056 --> 04:52.526
You had sex with...
Last night.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.128
You know how Mom always says
that things work out

04:55.128 --> 04:57.230
in the end the way
they're supposed to?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.565
She's right.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.368
I wouldn't have time
to represent the witches now

05:01.368 --> 05:03.036
with a boyfriend,

05:03.036 --> 05:05.205
so you getting the
consolation prize is perfect.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.339
Okay.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.841
I need your help.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.976
I'm going
for Meghan Markle tasteful.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.845
PENELOPE:
Woot, woot!

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
Happy birthday, witches.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.248
LIZZIE:
Oh, look. It's Satan

05:15.248 --> 05:18.185
in a crop top.
Come to burn my world down?
Retro.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.488
Princess Di
before she got style. I dig it.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.691
What do you want?
Oh, just to cheer
you two up. You know,

05:24.691 --> 05:26.059
'cause your mom's not coming.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.994
What?
What?
Oh, I heard them cancel

05:27.994 --> 05:31.364
her pickup at the office.
I thought you knew.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.399
Oops.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.576
I put a basic boundary spell
to keep her in.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.178
Are you sure she can't do magic?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.247
She couldn't before she died,
so if she can now,

05:47.247 --> 05:48.748
I guess we'll learn
the hard way.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.251
Um, she's right here.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.886
And she's got
a lot of questions.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.788
Be careful with this one, Ric.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.765
Okay, let's talk.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.468
Who are you

06:08.468 --> 06:12.105
I'm Josette Laughlin,
almost Saltzman.
No.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.306
Jo Laughlin is dead.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.442
I'm well aware.
It's not every day

06:15.442 --> 06:17.410
you get murdered
at your shotgun wedding.
Okay.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.279
What's the last thing
you remember?

06:20.780 --> 06:22.782
Morning sickness.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.485
My dress.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.153
Our vows.

06:27.153 --> 06:30.590
My psychopath twin brother with
a very large knife. And then...

06:32.392 --> 06:34.794
...nothing.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.631
How long ago was that?

06:37.631 --> 06:40.100
You look a little... seasoned.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.502
About 16 years ago.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.505
16 years.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.842
I don't know what to say.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.176
How are you

06:50.176 --> 06:52.779
Oh, just cut the...
Just drop the act, okay?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.314
It's not an act, Ric.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.815
This is Mystic Falls.
I'm not exactly

06:55.815 --> 06:58.151
the first person to be
brought back from the dead.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.152
Yeah, well, things have gotten
a little complicated

06:59.152 --> 07:00.153
around here lately.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.690
LIZZIE:
Uh, Dad?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.458
Why is your door locked?

07:05.458 --> 07:08.028
"Dad"?

07:09.296 --> 07:10.630
And when were you
going to tell us

07:10.630 --> 07:11.698
that Mom wasn't coming back?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.266
ALARIC:
I was about to.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.368
There-There's a strike
at the airport in Mozambique.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.705
LIZZIE:
She couldn't compel a pilot

07:18.705 --> 07:20.307
and hop on a private jet?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.541
ALARIC:
She'll explain everything later.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.043
Okay? But right now
I just need you

07:23.043 --> 07:25.178
to go because I am wrapping
your presents.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.680
No, you're not. You're lying

07:26.680 --> 07:28.181
through your teeth.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.355
(Lizzie and Josie
speak foreign language)

07:39.959 --> 07:41.194
Who's this trollop?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.829
Oh, my God.
I need you to leave

07:42.829 --> 07:44.964
right now.
I'm sorry.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.633
How old are you?

07:46.633 --> 07:47.701
16.
16.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.002
Today.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.570
It's our birthday.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.971
You're twins?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.873
What are we interrupting here?
ALARIC:
I'm serious.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.542
Do as I say and now just go.

07:55.542 --> 07:56.976
Lizzie.
What?

07:56.976 --> 07:59.679
Lizzie, it's her.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.648
Her who?

08:08.688 --> 08:10.223
Her.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.563
Holy crap.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.933
You're Bio-mom.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.740
This is impossible.
I wasn't even showing

08:26.740 --> 08:28.241
at our wedding. How...

08:28.241 --> 08:31.077
Your family's crazy coven
magically implanted them

08:31.077 --> 08:32.779
in Caroline when you died.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.381
She's their birth mother.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.416
Caroline?

08:36.416 --> 08:37.751
So...

08:37.751 --> 08:39.886
you two...
No.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.188
She married Stefan Salvatore.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.591
Who basically died
on their wedding day, too,

08:44.591 --> 08:45.925
but that's a long story.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.861
They're still very close.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.196
We opened this school together.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.065
She's overseas right now
doing very important

08:52.065 --> 08:53.600
recruiting work.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.903
I'm Lizzie. After
my mother's mom.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.905
And I'm Josie.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.608
Josette. Like...

09:01.608 --> 09:02.909
Me.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.211
HOPE:
So, the emcee

09:05.211 --> 09:07.113
will then announce Lizzie
and her escort.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.815
Her what?
Kind of like at a,

09:08.815 --> 09:10.283
a debutante ball.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.718
I grew up in foster care.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.487
Okay. Well, they had stairs,
didn't they?

09:14.487 --> 09:17.323
So, you're gonna meet her
halfway down.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.259
How do you know all this stuff?

09:19.259 --> 09:22.429
One of my aunts has been around
for more than a thousand years.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.732
This kind of thing is her jam.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.802
So, what, I just stand here?

09:28.802 --> 09:32.338
Then you take her arm.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.407
Sort of like you're
putting yours on top.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.510
Yeah, like that. And then
you descend together.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.851
And now you bow.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.355
Yeah, you're messing with me.
You think this is bad?

09:49.355 --> 09:50.623
You know it's only
gonna get worse, right?

09:50.623 --> 09:51.958
Lizzie Saltzman
has been planning

09:51.958 --> 09:54.360
her sweet 16 since she was five.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.529
You probably should've
thought twice before asking

09:56.529 --> 09:59.532
to be her date.
Well, I didn't ask her.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.101
All I know is that I can't
let her down now.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.303
Why?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.672
Because I slept with her, Hope.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.542
You're lucky I respect women

10:09.542 --> 10:12.011
and that I shun all forms
of toxic masculinity,

10:12.011 --> 10:14.881
or else you and I would be
throwing down right now.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.117
Even if you can kick my ass.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.718
Dude, I am here to help.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.220
By telling Lizzie and Josie
that their mom isn't coming?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.721
Oh, that was just for Lizzie,

10:21.721 --> 10:25.158
who is taking Rafael
as her date instead of you.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.326
So why are you doing all this

10:26.326 --> 10:27.727
to try and make
her party perfect?

10:27.727 --> 10:29.696
'Cause a man's
got to shoot his shot.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.898
Oh, my God. No.
I can't take it anymore.

10:31.898 --> 10:36.035
As your friend, I demand that
you retrieve your little MGs

10:36.035 --> 10:37.370
from Lizzie's grip.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.038
Not when I can taste victory.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.976
Fine.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.410
I'll make you a deal.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.579
I will keep
Werewolf Prince Charming away

10:46.579 --> 10:48.147
from the party long
enough for you

10:48.147 --> 10:50.550
to shoot your one, final,

10:50.550 --> 10:52.852
inevitably failed shot.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.321
And when it's over,
and the Queen of Mean

10:55.321 --> 10:58.091
has broken your heart
all over again, promise me

10:58.091 --> 11:01.427
that you will
let Lizzie go.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.164
ALARIC:
All right, one more time.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.933
What's your name?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.535
Josette Laughlin.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.605
And what's your profession?

11:12.605 --> 11:13.873
I'm a doctor.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.875
I was, anyway.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.445
Repeat after me:

11:19.445 --> 11:21.180
I'm here to harm you.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.449
I'm here to harm you.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.220
How did you meet my dad?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.588
That's not, uh, a question.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.457
I walked up to him
at a college party.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.960
He was the only guy over 20.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.128
Was it love at first sight?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.462
Jo.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.299
Don't be so nosy.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.533
Not quite.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.136
I flirted with him and asked him

11:43.136 --> 11:44.971
for a sip of his drink.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.539
He told me he was a germophobe.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.410
But I thought he looked
like Indiana Jones, so...

11:52.879 --> 11:57.216
This walk down weird old people
memory lane is fun and all,

11:57.216 --> 11:59.385
but we have a party
to get ready for.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.755
Will you still be here after?

12:02.755 --> 12:04.824
ALARIC:
I will be there
when I can.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.726
But right now
the office is off limits.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.401
One, two, three.
One, two...

12:15.401 --> 12:17.003
I can't believe you slept
with Lizzie Saltzman.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.238
Look, I was mad

12:18.238 --> 12:20.473
and she was there.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.775
I didn't say I was proud of it.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.245
You're leading.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.451
You're officially a gigolo.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.154
Thanks for this.

12:37.156 --> 12:40.259
I guess I'll see you
at the party.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.095
No, you won't.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.330
So, what, you're just gonna
stay in your room alone

12:44.330 --> 12:46.099
while everybody else
is out having fun?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.267
Yep, works for me.
Bullcrap.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.769
Everybody needs a crew.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.105
Kind of ironic coming
from the reluctant alpha.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.307
Okay, well, the pack is
one thing, but a crew is a crew.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.776
You know what? I had that in
Landon until you sent him away.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.112
We're back to that?
I'm just saying.
It's one thing

12:59.112 --> 13:01.447
to be cool with being alone,
and then it's another

13:01.447 --> 13:02.949
to want to be the lonely girl
on purpose.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.051
As opposed to Mr. Good Guy,
who's taking a girl

13:05.051 --> 13:06.619
that you don't even like
to her own party?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.888
You know what, you're right.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.992
Lesson learned.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.032
The hell?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.135
Barrier spell.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.469
Fantastic.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.038
Sorry, kids.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.372
Nothing personal.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.074
Let us out of here, Penelope.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.709
You'll be free in an hour.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.477
Plenty of time
to practice that waltz.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.651
ALARIC:
I-I don't get it.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.387
She hasn't tried to escape,
not a word about the knife.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.823
She knows things that only Jo
knows and let's not ignore

13:43.823 --> 13:45.591
the fact that I remember her,

13:45.591 --> 13:47.060
so she's not like
the other creatures.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.062
Blunt force hasn't gotten them
what they want,

13:49.062 --> 13:50.997
so they've moved on
to psychological warfare.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.899
Tread lightly. If Jo
is another monster,

13:52.899 --> 13:55.568
she can do more damage
to you than any dragon.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.203
DORIAN:
It was something
she said...

13:57.203 --> 13:58.771
Here.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.506
There's an eyewitness account

14:00.506 --> 14:02.275
of a group of
World War I soldiers buried

14:02.275 --> 14:04.243
in France who
came back to life

14:04.243 --> 14:06.012
and massacred a village.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.847
After, they didn't
remember hurting anyone.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.184
And they all said they'd been
"yanked" back into being.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.685
Like Jo.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.455
Wait, so someone or something
resurrected them

14:15.455 --> 14:17.423
and used them
to attack a village?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.058
Without them even knowing it.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.131
Dad is so suspicious.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.266
Uh, duh. So am I.

14:27.266 --> 14:31.537
I just think that she's more
fairy godmother than zombie.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.439
She's not our mother.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.274
She's DNA.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.077
We can be mad at Mom all that
we want for missing our party,

14:38.077 --> 14:42.081
but we cannot cheat on her
with Mombie Dearest.

14:43.649 --> 14:46.085
You're not even dressed.

14:46.085 --> 14:48.254
I don't want to be late
to my own party.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.555
I'm done.

Why can't you just ease up
on her?

15:50.149 --> 15:52.485
She sucks the air out

Is there someone special?

18:58.838 --> 19:02.208
That is a complicated question.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.414
Humor me.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.317
Well...

19:11.317 --> 19:16.155
Last year, there was this girl,
um, but she dumped me.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.157
Oh.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.892
And now there's this boy.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.228
Um, but Lizzie has dibs, so...

19:22.228 --> 19:24.897
Does she know you like him?

19:24.897 --> 19:29.568
No. That would be... bad.

19:31.203 --> 19:35.107
Being 16 and having a strong
twin sister isn't a cakewalk.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.076
But anybody who spent
five minutes with you

19:37.076 --> 19:39.211
would know how special you are.

19:39.211 --> 19:43.282
You're only saying that
because you're...

19:44.850 --> 19:46.886
It's okay.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.788
Caroline is your mom.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.057
She did a great job.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.592
Lizzie's exactly
like her.

19:53.592 --> 19:57.029
You would never know that
she's not her biological mom.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.466
And you take after me.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.138
I'm really happy you're here.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.910
I honestly think that Dad
is really lonely.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.614
He's a pretty terrific guy,
your dad.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.216
But you can
catch me up later.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.618
You have a party to go to.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.891
Actually, do you want to
come with me?

20:28.127 --> 20:30.129
RAFAEL:
So you can slay a dragon,

20:30.129 --> 20:31.430
but you can't get us
out of here.

20:31.430 --> 20:34.333
Only Penelope can
undo the spell.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.137
Or the twins could
siphon the magic.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.339
Well, that's unlikely, seeing
as Lizzie probably thinks

20:40.339 --> 20:41.807
I'm standing her up
right now.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.110
Her ego could use
a little bit of deflating.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.411
I'm not that guy, okay?

20:45.411 --> 20:48.013
I don't just forget
about people.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.915
Relax. It's only been 12 hours.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.584
It's not that!

20:51.584 --> 20:53.119
Look,

20:53.119 --> 20:56.322
it has only been six weeks
since...

20:56.322 --> 20:58.624
Your girlfriend died.

20:58.624 --> 20:59.992
Cassie.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.461
It's crazy,
but I feel like...

21:02.461 --> 21:04.830
like I cheated on her
or something.

21:04.830 --> 21:05.965
So if I can do right

21:05.965 --> 21:07.633
by Lizzie, maybe that can...
Then what?

21:07.633 --> 21:09.535
It'll exonerate you?
I don't know.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.670
Maybe.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.839
you went through

21:13.839 --> 21:16.542

mourn your girlfriend,

21:16.542 --> 21:18.511

21:18.511 --> 21:20.513
to like Lizzie to make
yourself feel better.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.815
That's not doing her any good,

21:22.815 --> 21:25.551

Raf, I didn't just
send Landon away.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.117
I sent him to someone

23:05.117 --> 23:07.052

find his birth mom.

Josie wanted me
to come to the party, and so,

she siphoned the spell again.
I know it was stupid,

25:26.291 --> 25:28.060
but I just... I wanted
to see their Sweet 16.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.528
Okay, just tell me
exactly what happened.

I don't know. I-I was with her
one minute, and then...

Ric, I lost time.
I don't know. I must have

25:35.100 --> 25:37.569
done something to her,
but I just, I don't know.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.208

There's a knife

Hey. Have you seen Josie?

26:13.472 --> 26:15.340
She's probably having
the time of her life,

26:15.340 --> 26:18.444

Charming showed up

26:18.444 --> 26:20.179

We're gonna duel.
No.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.525
No, we're not doing that.
I'm holding you to our deal.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.595
As of this moment,
Lizzie Saltzman's cancelled.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.100

Apparently, her possessed

alive in the cemetery.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.340

27:21.340 --> 27:23.141
you don't give the bad guys
what they want,

know what it does.

What?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.839
It's okay, Josie.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.908
It's okay.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.678
I'm already dead.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.179
