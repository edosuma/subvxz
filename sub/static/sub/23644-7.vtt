WEBVTT

00:10.577 --> 00:13.212
This is a terrible place.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.514
It's out of control.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.751
My whole life has been
turned upside down.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.853
"You are in the pit of Hell."

00:20.855 --> 00:22.054
What do you
think's here?

00:22.056 --> 00:23.088
Death.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.323
That's where the
Manson family hung out.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.792
It makes people evil.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.360
I feel punished
every day.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.462
I just don't want to
wake up sometimes.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.597
My God.

00:31.599 --> 00:35.167
She doesn't get better,
she gets worse.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.136
I don't know how
anybody lives here.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.272
The pain is ridiculous.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.374
Panic, panic, panic.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.377
My name is Amy Allan.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.912
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:46.914 --> 00:50.315
The house just feels bad.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.784
I see dead people.

00:51.786 --> 00:56.388
This man is completely insane.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.324
I speak to dead people.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.526
Okay, she doesn't
like it in there.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.495
And they speak to me.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.197
He likes to twist that knife.

01:05.199 --> 01:09.034
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:09.036 --> 01:12.638
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.206
I rely on my partner.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.908
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.077
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.678
Now, does he die right
there on the spot?

01:19.680 --> 01:23.682
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.251
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.119
It's my job to reveal them.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.189
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.024
But Steve and I never speak...

01:32.026 --> 01:34.159
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.694
...until the very end...

01:35.696 --> 01:37.496
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.565
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:39.567 --> 01:41.767
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.668
...or time to get out.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.104
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

02:02.389 --> 02:03.722
I'm in Chatsworth, California.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.924
It's a suburb about
an hour outside of L.A.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.092
I got a call from
woman named Nancy.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.762
Now, she sounded really bad
when I spoke to her.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.397
She was crying and
said her dream house

02:12.399 --> 02:14.999
is trying to kill her.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.269
I'm really hoping Amy and
I can help this woman out.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.742
Before Amy arrives,

02:23.744 --> 02:27.746
I clear the area of any
leading information.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.348
This home has a
lot of photographs,

02:30.350 --> 02:32.717
musical instruments,

02:32.719 --> 02:35.554
and dream catchers.

02:35.556 --> 02:39.691
So it's important I
cover or remove them all.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.228
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.108
God.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.445
This particular area

03:00.447 --> 03:04.215
is extremely negative.

03:04.217 --> 03:09.021
There's something
with the Earth.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.656
Extremely bad, bad, bad area.

03:11.658 --> 03:16.261
It's just a huge,
huge black hole.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.731
I'm hearing, "You are
literally in the pit of Hell."

03:32.079 --> 03:33.411
You know, Nancy, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:33.413 --> 03:34.879
you were pretty upset.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.948
Kind of broke my heart
to hear you cry.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.583
What's going on
with you here?

03:38.585 --> 03:41.620
My whole life has been
turned upside down.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.690
It's kind of like
being trapped in Hell.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.626
I feel punished
every day.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.362
I just don't want to
wake up sometimes.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.896
We're gonna try to help
you out here, okay?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.432
Thank you.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.432
Do you live here alone?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.567
Yeah, I'm alone.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.968
Just me and a couple
of my kitties.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.371
So what attracted
you to this house?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.539
Being in
the music industry,

04:00.541 --> 04:02.774
I wanted some peace
and quiet,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.310
just not be
around the rat race.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.745
I thought I was
gonna grown old here.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.314
I really thought this was
where I was gonna die.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.783
Have you experienced
paranormal

04:11.785 --> 04:12.718
before you moved here?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.287
Yes, since I was
even very young,

04:15.289 --> 04:16.853
I've been a sensitive.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.523
So, Nancy, you believe
you have abilities?

04:18.524 --> 04:21.993
Yes, I've been told
many times I'm empathic.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.928
Okay, so do me a favor
and give me a list

04:23.930 --> 04:25.897
of what the hell's
going on in this house.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.299
There's footsteps.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.869
I see shadow figures.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.305
I get physical touching.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.440
I have nightmares.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.609
They're terrifying.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.812
My health just
started deteriorating.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.814
What kind of health
issues are we talking?

04:42.816 --> 04:46.751
Since I moved in, I started
having skeletal issues.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.486
I have multiple sclerosis.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.888
I have a brain tumor.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.625
- A what?
- A brain tumor.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.696
They monitor it and I'm
going blind in my left eye.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.397
I can't feel my legs.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.364
Honey, I'm sorry.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.100
Thank you.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.068
Thank you.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.704
You're welcome.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.573
So, I'm really glad
you guys are here.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.041
Sounds like since
you moved here,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.910
everything went
downhill for you.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.845
I used to have everything.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.379
I was the it girl.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.650
I had it all and I
have nothing now.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.053
It's literally
this house.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.721
Since I walked in,

05:22.723 --> 05:26.124
a place of happiness
turned into just

05:26.126 --> 05:27.125
this big nightmare.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.660
Just everything's gone.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.928
Why the hell would
you stay here?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.730
I put everything
into this house

05:31.732 --> 05:33.732
and this is why
I have you here.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.167
Okay.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.101
'Cause I'd really
like to keep my house.

05:42.643 --> 05:46.211
The interesting thing
here is that the living

05:46.213 --> 05:50.282
and the dead are so meshed,

05:50.284 --> 05:53.585
it's like they're living
in each other's realities.

05:55.021 --> 05:59.091
The living people who live
here are way too open.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.494
I want to say that there's
at least two sensitives

06:02.496 --> 06:04.963
who are living who
are consistently here.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.431
Can you elaborate
on that?

06:06.433 --> 06:08.833
Living people have been
attracted to this place

06:08.835 --> 06:11.303
because it's haunted.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.574
I think that people come
here and the thing is,

06:16.576 --> 06:18.143
is they're pulled.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.445
I think they think most of
it's positive, but it's not.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.180
It's really not.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.848
Most of it's negative.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.251
It's out of control.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.452
It's not good.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.728
All right, Nancy, so
what's going on in here?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.430
I get touched.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.331
It's almost like
caressing.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.000
Where are you
being touched?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.502
My arms, my hands.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.636
How often
does that happen?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.004
Sporadically.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.872
Couple times a week.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.207
It's very shocking.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.143
Anything else physical
like that ever happen?

06:51.145 --> 06:52.544
I wake up with bruising,

06:52.546 --> 06:55.046
and it would be
like somebody's grabbed me.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.448
I don't live with anybody,

06:56.450 --> 06:58.350
so where are these
bruises coming from?

06:58.352 --> 07:00.552
People that have a white
blood cell that's low

07:00.554 --> 07:01.686
bruise easily.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.753
Is that something to do
with your conditions?

07:02.755 --> 07:04.322
No, I'm fine that way.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.224
Okay, all right.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.130
I'm getting a lot --
a lot of physical pain.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.900
Something's happening
here on my neck

07:15.902 --> 07:17.769
and a pain in my stomach.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.171
Some of the pain I'm
having is related

07:20.173 --> 07:21.706
to a living person.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.442
It's like something's got them.

07:24.444 --> 07:30.181
I think that they have a dead
person that is doing this

07:30.183 --> 07:31.315
to them all the time.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.786
It's a dead woman.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.521
It's causing a lot of this pain.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.590
There's always this pain.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.258
Do you know who this
is happening to?

07:40.260 --> 07:43.094
I'm damn positive it's a female.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.797
Do you have any idea why
she's wanting to do this

07:45.799 --> 07:46.798
to this person?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.933
She hates them, hates them.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.435
Feels trapped, bound.

07:53.907 --> 07:57.742
She's making this weird
noise all the time.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.612
It's like a combination
of growling and screaming

08:00.614 --> 08:03.048
and wanting to bite.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.816
Not good.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.827
All right, Nanc, so this
is your room, I assume?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.562
- Yes.
- Okay, so what's going on?

08:17.564 --> 08:18.763
It's just mood swings.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.231
I wake up angry.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.499
It happens a lot.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.534
It's like it's
someone else's anger.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.903
It's not mine.
- What do you mean?

08:25.905 --> 08:29.074
I feel like someone's maybe
attached to me somehow.

08:29.076 --> 08:32.309
I had a friend tell me
that your outbursts affect

08:32.312 --> 08:34.379
her being around me.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.381
Nothing worse than
needing somebody

08:36.383 --> 08:37.648
and then
they're not there.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.650
Yeah.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.717
All right, anything else?

08:39.719 --> 08:41.119
Um, there's
shadow figures.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.488
It looks like somebody's
passing the window.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.389
So when you're seeing
this shadow go by,

08:45.391 --> 08:48.326
is it the same height all
the time, different heights?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.494
What are
we talking about?

08:49.496 --> 08:50.929
It seems
about the same height,

08:50.931 --> 08:54.132
that it reminds me of a man
who's probably about 5'11".

08:54.134 --> 08:55.967
Have you ever checked
for anyone outside?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.636
Yeah, nobody.
Nobody's there.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.111
I don't like it back there.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.813
There's death back there,
there's death.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.686
Okay, this is bad.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.822
There is a negative entity here.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.825
What people would call
it would be a demon.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.293
It's evil.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.163
The living here can
hear it breathing.

09:25.165 --> 09:29.367
They see shadow things
going back and forth.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.768
And I'm dizzy.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.771
Living people have
that a lot here.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.309
All right, so what
else is going on?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.378
I get
the worst nightmares.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.313
It's the same dream
I've had repetitively

09:42.315 --> 09:43.314
for several years.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.449
Tell me
about the nightmares.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.583
I'm curious what they are.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.218
I started being attacked.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.321
I feel like this demon
thing is pulling me back.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.124
So when you talk about
this demon in this dream,

09:53.126 --> 09:55.059
do you see it or is
it just a feeling?

09:55.061 --> 09:58.196
I see it with arms.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.264
I don't really see it
like I see you.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.699
Okay.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.268
Do you think whatever's
here is intentionally trying

10:03.270 --> 10:04.668
to hurt you and get
you out of here?

10:04.670 --> 10:06.471
I don't know if it's
trying to get me out

10:06.473 --> 10:08.473
as much as it's
trying to keep me in.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.945
This person is having
constant nightmares,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.880
but no one's sleeping.

10:15.882 --> 10:19.150
Someone now has developed
breathing issues.

10:24.991 --> 10:29.694
I thought I saw something
crawling from out under the bed,

10:29.696 --> 10:33.697
which they might actually see.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.067
I'm getting the
head thing again.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.234
I don't know how
anybody lives here.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.771
The pain is ridiculous.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.594
So, Jodie, I was
talking to Nancy.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.963
I understand you're
good friends with her.
Yeah.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.131
You know, she's one of my
best friends in the world.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.731
She feels whatever's
in this house

11:07.733 --> 11:08.999
is causing her
health to decline.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.335
Do you agree with that?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.804
I do.
She is really struggling.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.740
What used to be so easy
for her

11:15.742 --> 11:19.610
is 1,000 times harder
than it ever used to be.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.112
As you get older,
I mean,

11:21.114 --> 11:22.746
I can't blame the
paranormal on my stuff.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.549
So why do you think
it's the paranormal here?

11:24.551 --> 11:28.019
When I met her,
she was vibrant,

11:28.021 --> 11:31.222
vivacious,
so strong,

11:31.224 --> 11:34.225
and just could
set her mind to anything

11:34.227 --> 11:35.960
and accomplish it.

11:35.962 --> 11:40.465
And now she
struggles every day.

11:40.467 --> 11:44.935
She'll just get
angry for no reason.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.638
She will break down,

11:46.640 --> 11:48.706
'cause she doesn't
want to live like this.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.509
Okay, so now as far as
experiences in the house,

11:51.511 --> 11:53.978
have you had any?

11:53.980 --> 11:57.014
I've just had
a really creepy feeling.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.450
Like I don't like
being alone here.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.852
Okay, why?

12:00.854 --> 12:03.320
It's like someone's
standing behind you almost.

12:03.322 --> 12:04.455
Okay.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.423
And that makes me
really worried for her.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.391
I was gonna ask ya,
I mean,

12:06.393 --> 12:07.459
you gotta be worried
about her.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.026
She's your good friend.
- Absolutely.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.496
- Think she's in danger here?
- Yes.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.730
What about her
moving out of here?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.998
What's your opinion
on that?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.602
I would really, really
like to see her go

12:17.604 --> 12:21.806
and just experience new
energy and just have

12:21.808 --> 12:23.641
a chance at a new life.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.650
There's a lot of
random dead out here.

12:32.652 --> 12:36.987
These are like shadow people,
but they're dead people.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.158
It's possible that living
people in the neighborhood,

12:40.160 --> 12:43.427
as well as here, have seen them.

12:45.798 --> 12:50.768
I think all of this
going all the...way back

12:50.770 --> 12:53.805
should be mowed down

12:53.807 --> 12:57.275
and made into nothing.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.743
That's how I feel
about this place.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.582
Like all of a sudden,
I'm enraged.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.050
Your blood pressure goes up
and your head's pounding

13:06.052 --> 13:08.987
and you're, like,
just ready to...

13:08.989 --> 13:11.189
like, beat the..
out of somebody.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.731
So Nicole, I understand

13:20.733 --> 13:21.866
you're good friends
with Nancy.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.234
Yes.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.671
I've known Nancy for 12
years now, almost 13 years.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.073
She was talking about how
bad her health has declined.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.074
And she blames the house

13:30.076 --> 13:31.375
and what's going on here
on it.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.810
Do you agree with that?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.011
I do agree.

13:34.013 --> 13:37.215
This place is,
it's unhealthy.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.616
It's unnatural.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.618
I'm an extremely
sensitive person,

13:40.620 --> 13:41.953
and I've been tormented

13:41.955 --> 13:44.555
for about 15 years of my life
because of it.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.624
Okay.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.992
How about here?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.761
Have you had any
experiences in this house?

13:49.763 --> 13:51.629
Yes, I spent
the night here.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.765
I had
a terrifying dream.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.833
So Nancy told me
about her nightmares.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.235
What are yours like?

13:57.237 --> 14:00.104
Literally being held down,
like being pulled down

14:00.106 --> 14:01.906
in a bed
that was in this room.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.541
I was reaching
for the sky.

14:03.543 --> 14:07.378
I was reaching for some
greater, higher power

14:07.380 --> 14:10.515
and having
these clawing hands

14:10.517 --> 14:12.783
kind of holding me back.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.118
I felt like I was paralyzed,
like I couldn't move.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.820
I felt nothing
in my body moved.

14:16.822 --> 14:17.955
I'm gonna just go
out and say it.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.791
It's a demonic dream.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.692
Okay, so anything else?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.628
Yeah, I would get hit in
this house all the time.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.263
When you say hit, you
mean physically hit?

14:26.265 --> 14:29.267
Yes.
I would feel these pains.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.601
I would get hit
in my neck.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.403
I've been hit in my hip.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.571
Feels like you're
getting stabbed.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.739
Feels like
you're getting cut.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.407
So when this happened,

14:36.409 --> 14:38.075
did you get a sense
that it was a human?

14:38.077 --> 14:40.678
No,
this was not human.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.547
This was something that
scared me and made me cry.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.217
Would you say Nancy's
in danger here?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.820
Yeah, I think that her
health and her life

14:48.822 --> 14:51.488
is in danger being here.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.890
She's sick.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.894
She doesn't get better,
she gets worse.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.297
And she was perfectly
fine when I met her.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.498
So what do you
think's here?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.032
Death.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.772
I don't know, it's
just very loud in here.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.906
It's very bad in here.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.976
It's very negative in here.

15:11.978 --> 15:16.314
There are dead that are
coming from around here

15:16.316 --> 15:18.549
and coming and going
and coming and going.

15:22.922 --> 15:29.393
it's like a white path and
I see a trail of death.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.797
It's the same people
over and over again.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.933
Somebody here is
bringing dead people,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.802
so that's not good.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.152
Look, I know the Manson
family's hideout

15:54.154 --> 15:55.353
was in this area,

15:55.355 --> 15:57.488
so I reached out to
a local crime writer.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.024
Now, he says there was
actually another deadly cult

16:00.026 --> 16:02.626
that operated real
close to Nancy's house.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.930
I'm hoping this is gonna
help my investigation.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.804
So, Mike, I know Manson
had some sort of a hideout

16:13.806 --> 16:14.872
near my client's property.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.340
What can you tell me
about that?

16:16.342 --> 16:18.409
It was about 2 miles away
from your client's house,

16:18.411 --> 16:20.478
and they called it
Spawn Ranch.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.747
Manson gave his orders
from the ranch.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.983
That was their home base
and he would decide

16:25.985 --> 16:28.118
who's gonna live and
who's gonna die

16:28.120 --> 16:31.055
and a lot of his followers
were these teenagers,

16:31.057 --> 16:32.489
some from good homes.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.891
It was shocking.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.093
People said, "This
could be my daughter."

16:36.095 --> 16:39.062
So I know in '69, Manson and
his followers wreaked havoc

16:39.064 --> 16:41.699
through these hills here,
but refresh my memory,

16:41.701 --> 16:43.467
what was the body count,
what happened?

16:43.469 --> 16:46.203
9 people died in
the summer of 1969.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.972
These followers
were involved in two

16:47.974 --> 16:50.241
of the most famous
murders in L.A. history.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.411
One was the Sharon Tate murders
in the Hollywood Hills.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.147
She was an actress
married to Roman Polanski.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.282
Tate was what, almost
nine months pregnant?

16:58.284 --> 16:59.850
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.620
They stabbed her to
death and four others.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.121
Next day, they go

17:04.123 --> 17:07.290
to Leno and
Rosemary LaBianca's house,

17:07.292 --> 17:09.359
stab them to death.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.194
Was there any violence
on the ranch

17:11.196 --> 17:12.563
near my client's property?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.765
There was a murder
on the ranch.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.166
This was a guy
named Donald Shea.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.367
He was a stunt man,

17:18.369 --> 17:20.771
sort of a ranch hand
at the Spawn Ranch

17:20.772 --> 17:23.641
and Manson, after those
killings, was very paranoid.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.108
He thought people were
ratting him out and he thought

17:25.111 --> 17:27.912
this guy, Shea, was ratting
him out and had him killed.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.113
Okay, so what were the
circumstances of his murder?

17:30.115 --> 17:31.849
It was a grizzly killing.

17:31.851 --> 17:35.419
They hit him over the head,
stabbed him repeatedly,

17:35.421 --> 17:37.655
and then ditched his
body in the hills

17:37.657 --> 17:40.258
just about 2 miles from
your client's property.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.493
You know, growing up on
the streets of Brooklyn

17:42.495 --> 17:43.661
and looking at this,
you would think,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.263
this is a safe place
to be.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.864
Yeah, the people who
lived here

17:46.866 --> 17:48.532
thought it was
a safe place to be.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.667
Turned out it wasn't.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.878
There are
a lot of dead people.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.780
I would say eight.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.149
These dead people
are murder victims.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.984
They were male and female.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.152
Did you get
a timeframe?

18:08.154 --> 18:10.621
I would say within
the last 60 years.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.691
There is a possibility that
two of them died together

18:13.693 --> 18:15.893
or five of them died together.

18:15.895 --> 18:20.964
I saw a woman and she
was short, well-endowed,

18:20.966 --> 18:22.300
was kind of bigger up here.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.902
So I don't know if she
had a belly or not,

18:24.904 --> 18:26.303
you know kind of thing.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.273
Then there was a girl
dragging me by my left arm.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.312
I'm having horrible
pain on my left side.

18:34.314 --> 18:38.082
Then there's another male.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.050
I'm getting that he
didn't die with the others

18:40.052 --> 18:44.055
and he's in the dark and
he's tall and he's thin,

18:44.057 --> 18:45.589
and he's young.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.725
I'm getting hit in the
head, right temple.

18:47.727 --> 18:53.831
I think that somebody came
here and killed this person.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.132
Now, you mentioned
on the phone

18:55.134 --> 18:56.534
there was another cult
in the area.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.669
What can you tell me
about that one?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.938
This is a cult that's even
closer to your client's house,

19:00.940 --> 19:02.873
about a half mile away.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.542
This was called The
Fountain of the World,

19:05.544 --> 19:08.445
and it was founded by this
guy named Francis Pencovic.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.281
Here's a picture of him.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.217
That's his wife
next to him.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.886
He looks the part.

19:14.888 --> 19:18.556
Now, he's a Jewish World
War II vet who came to believe

19:18.558 --> 19:21.626
that he was the reincarnation
of Jesus Christ.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.896
He changed his name from
Francis to Krishna Venta.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.564
They built the compound
in 1948.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.233
About 60 followers.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.500
Okay.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.836
They wore robes, they
went around barefooted,

19:32.838 --> 19:34.138
they were vegetarians,

19:34.140 --> 19:36.374
which was a little
weird at that time.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.175
Kind of early hippies.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.510
All right, they're
do-gooders eating vegetables.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.911
When did it go wrong?

19:40.913 --> 19:44.649
Krishna Venta was not
as he appeared to be.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.216
He had a dark side,

19:46.218 --> 19:49.720
and he was absconding
with his followers' money.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.988
He was taking it off
to Vegas and Reno,

19:50.990 --> 19:52.390
losing it
at the tables.

19:52.392 --> 19:56.260
He was sleeping with
their wives, sexual abuse,

19:56.262 --> 19:58.796
all kinds of stuff going
on behind the scenes.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.964
You know, one day,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.800
two former followers
didn't want any more of this,

20:02.802 --> 20:05.402
and they took matters
into their own hands.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.004
What did they do?

20:07.006 --> 20:10.807
1958, the two ex-followers
go into the compound,

20:10.809 --> 20:12.242
go up to a building.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.745
One of 'em's got 20 sticks
of dynamite strapped

20:14.747 --> 20:16.080
to his body.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.282
Blows the place
sky high.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.551
At the end of the day,
10 people are dead,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.887
including Krishna Venta.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.955
All right, so everybody's
blown up here.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.624
So did the cult end
at this point?

20:26.626 --> 20:27.825
Surprisingly no.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.360
It kept going for
years and years.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.828
There's a long rumor

20:30.830 --> 20:33.898
that Charles Manson
himself visited the cult

20:33.900 --> 20:35.032
in about 1968

20:35.034 --> 20:37.968
and that's where
he got some of his ideas.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.908
I'm seeing another group
of dead people out here.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.176
So how many are there?

20:46.178 --> 20:49.313
There's probably about
10 or 12 of these people

20:49.315 --> 20:54.151
and then there's a male
saying that he wanted money.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.654
He's pissed.
He's pissed.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.489
I'm being slapped
across the face.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.924
I'm on my knees.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.661
But I'm hearing now,
there's no church here.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.070
For more information
about the show

21:13.072 --> 21:14.871
and if you need us
to investigate

21:14.873 --> 21:16.807
unexplained activity
in your home...

21:16.809 --> 21:20.077
Please visit
travelchannel.com/thedeadfiles.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.079
Click on "Help Me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story

21:22.081 --> 21:23.214
and we'll help if we can.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.658
So far I've got a client
who believes the activity

21:33.660 --> 21:35.459
in her house is
trying to kill her

21:35.461 --> 21:39.530
on a property close to the
compounds of two deadly cults.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.565
But I want to see if
there's anything else.

21:43.036 --> 21:46.236
Searching through old records,
I find a French land baron

21:46.238 --> 21:48.005
named Miguel Leonis.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.240
Turns out Miguel used
to own Nancy's property

21:50.242 --> 21:53.310
and used any means
necessary to protect it.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.479
So I'm headed over to
meet a local historian

21:55.481 --> 21:56.947
who says that as
soon as this guy got

21:56.949 --> 21:58.282
to my client's property,

21:58.284 --> 22:01.285
he started acting real
violent and unstable.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.959
So Dinna,
I appreciate

22:08.961 --> 22:10.761
you helping me out
with this case.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.229
What do we know
about this guy

22:12.231 --> 22:14.031
that owned
my client's property?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.833
His name
was Miguel Leonis.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.435
He was from the Basque
region of France,

22:17.437 --> 22:20.705
and he arrived in
the area in 1854.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.108
All right, so how
does this guy

22:24.110 --> 22:25.842
wind up
with my client's property?

22:25.844 --> 22:29.447
In 1859, he enters into
common law marriage

22:29.449 --> 22:33.584
with a Chumash Indian
woman named Espiritu.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.989
This is where Miguel
and Espiritu lived.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.591
This is the actual
house they lived in?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.159
Yes.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.294
Okay, so now you mentioned
on the phone that this guy

22:43.296 --> 22:44.528
had, like,
a violent streak going.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.996
What was that all about?

22:45.998 --> 22:49.666
He was obsessed with building
his real-estate empire

22:49.668 --> 22:51.268
and his growing fortune.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.803
This land, this ranch,

22:52.805 --> 22:55.172
he basically stole
from his father-in-law.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.540
How'd he do that?

22:56.542 --> 22:59.210
He convinced his
father-in-law that in order

22:59.212 --> 23:00.811
to protect the ranch
from the government,

23:00.813 --> 23:04.281
he should sign title of
the property over to him

23:04.283 --> 23:05.482
as a temporary measure.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.817
Okay.

23:06.819 --> 23:10.287
Never, ever did he
transfer the ownership back

23:10.289 --> 23:11.588
to his father-in-law.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.390
- Really?
- Yes.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.625
What happens next
with this guy?

23:14.627 --> 23:18.428
Now he has his sites
set on acquiring land

23:18.430 --> 23:19.764
owned by his neighbors.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.265
Okay,
so how's he do that?

23:21.267 --> 23:24.535
Hounding people off their
property, burning crops,

23:24.537 --> 23:27.638
bribing judges,
intimidating witnesses.

23:27.640 --> 23:33.544
Which resulted in
control of 11,000 acres

23:33.546 --> 23:34.845
of property
in this area.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.580
Okay, so this guy was
a real piece of work.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.648
Absolutely.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.516
What ends up
happening to Leonis?

23:39.518 --> 23:42.586
While traveling over
the Cahuenga Pass

23:42.588 --> 23:44.054
with three others
in a heavy wagon

23:44.056 --> 23:45.389
full of firewood,
he somehow fell

23:45.391 --> 23:46.457
off his wagon

23:46.459 --> 23:48.325
and got crushed
underneath the wheels.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.166
It's just very bad in here.

23:55.168 --> 23:58.068
This is no good.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.537
This is a terrible place.

24:00.539 --> 24:04.875
I feel like I'm falling
into the ground here.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.545
I think the demon lives
in here

24:07.547 --> 24:11.549
and there's this darkness
with the demon.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.816
It's horrible.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.618
And how would the living
be affected by that?

24:14.620 --> 24:17.587
It makes people evil.

24:17.589 --> 24:20.491
I think a male died
here from this thing.

24:20.493 --> 24:24.428
I don't know how, but I think
that this thing killed a male.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.365
Another thing caught
my eye in research.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.901
One of the previous owners
of Nancy's property died

24:30.903 --> 24:33.304
in a tragic car accident
back in the '70s.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.539
I'm heading over to meet
a retired L.A.P.D. officer

24:35.541 --> 24:37.141
who dug into the case file
for me.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.577
She says there was no
justice for the victim.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.051
So, Cheryl, I appreciate

24:48.053 --> 24:49.153
you helping me out
with this case.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.387
Before we get
to the accident,

24:50.389 --> 24:51.922
what can you tell
me about the victim?

24:51.924 --> 24:54.858
Alice Lansman was 29 years
old, California native.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.894
She and her husband,
Mark, purchased the house

24:56.896 --> 24:59.730
that you're looking
into back in 1973.

24:59.732 --> 25:02.466
Okay, so they purchased
my client's house in 1973,

25:02.468 --> 25:04.868
but I know the accident
happened a few years later.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.670
What exactly happened?

25:06.672 --> 25:10.774
On January 11, 1977, at
approximately 10:30 p.m.,

25:10.776 --> 25:13.010
Alice was driving
about three miles

25:13.012 --> 25:14.277
from where
she lived with Mark.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.613
Okay.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.814
She entered the intersection
and was broad-sided

25:16.816 --> 25:18.315
by another vehicle.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.351
The other driver was driving
about 70 miles per hour

25:21.353 --> 25:23.720
at the time of impact
and it was so intense,

25:23.722 --> 25:25.889
that it literally knocked
the engine out of the car

25:25.891 --> 25:28.025
that was being driven
by Alice at the time.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.893
Really?
Does she die at the scene?

25:29.895 --> 25:31.995
What happened?
- She did die at the scene.

25:31.997 --> 25:34.898
She suffered brain trauma,
fractured skull,

25:34.900 --> 25:36.667
and according to the
coroner's report,

25:36.669 --> 25:40.871
she punctured her
spleen and her liver.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.909
Wow, this kid got hit
really, really bad.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.977
It's almost a good thing
she did die immediately.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.112
Now, what about the
driver that hit her?

25:49.114 --> 25:51.315
Did she get hurt?
- Actually she did.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.117
She received facial lacerations
and she was transported

25:53.119 --> 25:54.785
to the hospital for
medical treatment

25:54.787 --> 25:56.453
and was ultimately
arrested there

25:56.455 --> 25:57.687
for felony manslaughter.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.123
But according
to the records,

25:59.125 --> 26:01.458
there was no indication
that she ever served time.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.026
It looks like the case
just got dropped.

26:03.028 --> 26:04.194
It just went away.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.462
But there was no
justice for Alice,

26:05.464 --> 26:06.930
'cause she never
served a day in jail.

26:06.932 --> 26:07.998
Correct.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.272
There's a dead woman
with me right now.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.375
She's white, thin, she's young.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.011
She's probably,
like, in her 20s.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.480
She says --
She's trying to stop me.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.649
She doesn't want
to go back here.

26:25.651 --> 26:30.321
And she says, "Turn around,
you don't want this."

26:30.323 --> 26:32.256
And then she just
shows me blood.

26:32.258 --> 26:36.694
She has got blood all over
her, just fear, fear, fear.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.367
I saw several horrifying
things during my walk,

26:44.369 --> 26:45.970
but two stood out.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.339
First, the dead woman I saw
attacking a living person.

26:49.341 --> 26:54.645
The deceased female is
definitely a small build.

26:54.647 --> 26:58.181
She's always pushing
the living person's head

26:58.183 --> 27:01.118
and shoulder apart

27:01.120 --> 27:05.622
and the person is miserable.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.725
Next, I described how the
demon showed itself to me.

27:08.727 --> 27:11.995
It had really thick, black hair.

27:11.997 --> 27:17.200
The face was like a skull
without the jaw.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.409
Amy,
is this what you saw?

27:26.411 --> 27:28.345
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.067
Now that Amy
and I have completed

27:50.069 --> 27:52.602
our investigations, we're
ready to reveal our findings

27:52.604 --> 27:56.673
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.442
Amy, I'd like you
to meet Nancy.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.145
She lives here alone and
was hoping to grow old

28:01.147 --> 28:03.814
and die in this house.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.417
She still thinks
she's gonna die,

28:06.419 --> 28:08.685
just sooner
than expected.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.354
Nicole's
her longtime friend.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.089
She's really worried
about Nancy

28:12.091 --> 28:15.793
and thinks she's
in serious danger.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.261
Now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

28:18.263 --> 28:19.896
I'll ask her to
describe her walk.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.404
The second I walked
onto your property,

28:27.406 --> 28:30.974
I could tell that
there's definitely

28:30.976 --> 28:35.045
environmental factors
that are at play here.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.115
The energy around this
property is so intense

28:38.117 --> 28:41.852
that I believe it would
be an attractive area

28:41.854 --> 28:45.121
for a sensitive to go to.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.157
It almost draws you in,
you're thinking,

28:47.159 --> 28:50.059
"Whoo, I feel good here,"

28:50.061 --> 28:53.397
but it's a false positive.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.966
It's not actually good,
and the damage

28:56.968 --> 29:00.470
that it does to your
body is ridiculous.

29:02.941 --> 29:06.210
I did get that there were
at least two sensitives

29:06.212 --> 29:10.947
that were having experiences
in this location.

29:10.949 --> 29:13.483
I've been told
I'm an empath.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.218
Yeah, I can feel
when people die.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.288
- Really? Ew.
- It's awful.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.557
You feel like you have some
kind of sensitivity, don't you?

29:20.559 --> 29:23.927
Yes, I have felt people
take their lives.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.428
You have to learn how
to kind of block it out,

29:25.430 --> 29:26.897
but you get used to it.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.633
- She doesn't want the gift.
- No, I don't.

29:29.635 --> 29:33.169
God bless you, girl,
but I don't want it.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.972
Because there's
open sensitives,

29:35.974 --> 29:40.778
it's drawing a lot of dead
from surrounding areas.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.315
These are, like, shadow people.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.850
But they're dead people.

29:46.852 --> 29:50.821
It's possible that living
people in the neighborhood,

29:50.823 --> 29:53.323
as well as here, have seen them.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.191
Amy, Nancy told me
she sees

29:55.193 --> 29:57.995
shadow figures
outside her house.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.396
In the purple room,
there's windows,

30:00.398 --> 30:02.799
and you could always
catch the tail end

30:02.801 --> 30:04.434
of the guy going by
the window.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.403
Anybody's who's
stayed at my home,

30:06.405 --> 30:09.273
they would answer
the door, like, nonstop.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.741
And they were like,
"There's nobody here."

30:10.743 --> 30:13.076
Wow.

30:13.078 --> 30:16.413
This negative energy isn't
just drawing the dead in,

30:16.415 --> 30:20.717
it's also causing emotional
issues within the house.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.086
Extreme mood changes
with the living

30:23.088 --> 30:25.756
and what it brought out
was sudden anger

30:25.758 --> 30:28.759
and being suddenly
enraged out of nowhere,

30:28.761 --> 30:33.296
and I literally felt
blood pressure going up,

30:33.298 --> 30:38.135
and feeling this want
to beat the...out of somebody.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.804
Nancy, tell Amy
how you've changed,

30:40.806 --> 30:42.906
as far as your
personality goes.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.776
Well, what you just described
is exactly what happens.

30:45.778 --> 30:50.580
I get, out of nowhere,
just that angry.

30:50.582 --> 30:56.219
Really angry, like I
want to kill my cat.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.554
Hands-clenched anger.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.689
And I am not that person.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.261
So what else?

31:04.263 --> 31:07.698
I saw five people sitting
on a couch together.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.065
Then there were two more

31:09.067 --> 31:11.100
that were sitting
on a loveseat.

31:11.102 --> 31:12.269
They died together.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.339
And then I saw a male,
and he was, like,

31:15.341 --> 31:19.276
in the back, in the shadows,
elongated, thin.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.544
They all seemed
somehow to kind of

31:21.546 --> 31:24.347
know each other
or be related.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.517
I think they're coming
to your home

31:27.519 --> 31:29.152
trying to seek help.

31:29.154 --> 31:31.621
They would have died
within the last 60 years.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.823
It was all
violent deaths.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.092
The only man
who could speak,

31:36.094 --> 31:38.295
I believe
he was bludgeoned

31:38.297 --> 31:42.231
or something with his head,
because it was horrible.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.535
And then, when I walked
up to your front door,

31:45.537 --> 31:47.637
there was someone else
there, ready to kill.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.575
It scares me.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.909
It sounds a lot
like the history

31:52.911 --> 31:54.945
I'm sure everybody at
this table knows about.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.981
- Right, the Manson family.
- Exactly.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.382
What you probably
didn't know is that

31:59.384 --> 32:01.718
in the summer of '69,
the Manson family actually

32:01.720 --> 32:04.788
hid out about
2 miles from here.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.524
This is --
I don't like this.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.459
When I went to meditate,

32:09.461 --> 32:12.896
I was witnessing the murder
of Sharon Tate.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.465
I was literally
freaking the...out.

32:15.467 --> 32:19.136
My God, I don't
know how you do this.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.307
Manson's hideout is very
close to your property.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.209
It's called Spahn Ranch.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.111
Well, Spahn Ranch
is where he gave

32:28.113 --> 32:31.281
all the orders for
the murders in '69.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.951
I got a couple of photos.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.553
I'm sure you guys have
seen these before.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.959
They're on a rampage,
the family killed

32:42.961 --> 32:46.796
a total of nine people,
plus an unborn baby.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.366
5 people were killed
on August 8, 1969,

32:49.368 --> 32:53.436
which included Sharon Tate
and four others.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.172
The next night, two
more were murdered,

32:55.174 --> 32:58.108
Leno
and Rosemary LaBianca.

32:58.110 --> 32:58.975
Those murders happened

32:58.977 --> 33:00.377
kind of far from here,
in the city,

33:00.379 --> 33:03.580
but one person was murdered
right at the ranch.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.249
Three weeks after
the Tate-LaBianca murders,

33:06.251 --> 33:08.118
Manson started
getting paranoid

33:08.120 --> 33:10.320
with somebody ratting him
out to the cops,

33:10.322 --> 33:12.255
and he blamed
a local ranch hand,

33:12.257 --> 33:16.259
and it was a stunt guy
named Donald Shea.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.862
The family took this guy
out for a ride and beat him

33:18.864 --> 33:22.098
over the head with a pipe and
then stabbed him to death.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.669
Then they dumped his
body in the hills

33:25.671 --> 33:27.937
2 miles from here.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.906
Now, do you think
the Manson family

33:29.908 --> 33:32.209
is who you saw roaming
around Nancy's property?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.443
I think it's the victims.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.012
- The victims.
- Yes.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.448
They're seeking her
because she's a sensitive?

33:38.450 --> 33:40.483
Yes, because
she's a sensitive, yes.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.085
I don't know
what to do with it.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.422
I've got dead people seeking
me, but I can't help.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.760
Anything else?

33:49.762 --> 33:51.428
I'm in the living room,

33:51.430 --> 33:53.964
and I ran into
a dead older female.

33:53.966 --> 33:55.798
She was very tiny.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.302
But, very big problem,
she has attached herself

33:59.304 --> 34:03.173
to a living person
and wants revenge.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.977
She was yelling that
she felt trapped

34:06.979 --> 34:09.445
by the living
people in the house.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.181
She is very physical.

34:11.183 --> 34:15.118
I felt bad pain
in my neck,

34:15.120 --> 34:18.721
my upper back, my left
shoulder, and my stomach.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.123
And then
she hit me in the head.

34:21.126 --> 34:24.527
Um, so I felt like
the living there

34:24.530 --> 34:27.530
would definitely
have experiences

34:27.532 --> 34:30.367
with this female.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.735
Well, we've got a lot
to talk about here.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.137
Tell her how you
wake up bruised.

34:34.139 --> 34:37.873
Um, I get bruises,
legs or arms or, like,

34:37.876 --> 34:41.311
somebody's pressure
grabbed, you know?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.746
Now, Nicole, you've told
me about you getting...

34:43.748 --> 34:45.348
Hit, yeah.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.018
I got hit in the neck
and I got hit in my hip.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.085
You know, I want to
ask you something.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.620
Now, Nancy looks good.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.022
She looks healthy,
right?

34:52.024 --> 34:55.190
She has the health problems
of an 80-year-old person,

34:55.193 --> 34:56.493
and I'm wondering...
- Wow.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.762
...if it's related
to this old woman.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.898
I have primary progressive
multiple sclerosis.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.101
I have a brain tumor.
- What?

35:05.103 --> 35:08.104
I have -- there's
just a laundry list.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.039
I mean...
- What?

35:09.041 --> 35:11.241
...going blind in my left eye.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.509
What?

35:12.511 --> 35:13.843
Sometimes I can't walk.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.679
- Or even get up out of bed.
- Yeah.

35:16.681 --> 35:19.582
Whether you're aware
or not, you're a medium,

35:19.584 --> 35:23.052
but because you're not
protecting yourself,

35:23.054 --> 35:28.624
you're still going
to absorb, um, deaths.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.827
All right, so when
this old lady's attacking,

35:30.829 --> 35:31.995
what's it look like?

35:31.997 --> 35:35.599
I did have a sketch
done of what I saw.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.278
You're not gonna
like this.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.558
And this is all the time?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.959
All the time.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.728
'Cause she lives
on your back.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.301
This is heavy.
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.240
There was one more thing

36:17.242 --> 36:19.442
that I was
very worried about.

36:19.444 --> 36:22.178
I'm looking into the hall,

36:22.180 --> 36:25.215
and there's this
little dark thing going by.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.850
About the size of a child.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.585
It has sharp nails.

36:29.587 --> 36:30.787
And it is evil.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.689
Pure...evil.

36:32.691 --> 36:39.329
What I saw specifically was
what people call a demon,

36:39.331 --> 36:43.666
and all it wants to do
is cause harm, okay?

36:43.668 --> 36:46.035
I think that the living
might hear it breathing.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.939
It does sound kind of like
a rattling when it breathes.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.407
It can also be physical.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.776
Saw that it caused
terrible nightmares.

36:53.778 --> 36:58.315
I don't see how you can
sleep in that house.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.216
Nancy, tell Amy about the
recurring nightmares you have.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.754
I go up the stairs, I start
getting attacked by...

37:04.756 --> 37:06.456
I don't know what it is.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.026
When I wake up, I am
literally fighting,

37:10.028 --> 37:12.028
trying to pull
myself away from it.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.030
The first time that I
had ever spent the night,

37:14.032 --> 37:15.832
I was being held
down by something

37:15.834 --> 37:19.602
that was literally
restraining me to the bed.

37:19.604 --> 37:20.971
I was so scared.

37:20.973 --> 37:24.040
I knew I was gonna die.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.109
Okay, did you get
a good look at it?

37:26.111 --> 37:28.078
I had a sketch
done of what I saw.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.916
Oof.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.255
My God.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.658
This is so scary.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.596
What the hell is that?

37:51.136 --> 37:54.137
That is the creepiest thing.

37:54.139 --> 37:57.673
This makes me...
it makes me angry,

37:57.675 --> 38:01.277
and I feel so bad for you.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.979
I don't even know what
to say about this,

38:02.981 --> 38:06.449
and it's not even human, so how
am I supposed to fight this?

38:06.451 --> 38:07.950
Well, you know, she
basically turned out

38:07.952 --> 38:09.953
and told me, "I feel whatever's
here is gonna kill me."

38:09.955 --> 38:12.021
I mean,
is this a possibility?

38:12.023 --> 38:14.290
Well, yeah,
that's what I think.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.826
My God.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.995
That is so scary.

38:18.997 --> 38:22.632
This is awful.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.234
This is my first house.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.504
I was excited,
I bought it by myself,

38:28.506 --> 38:32.509
and I just thought I was
gonna be there forever.

38:51.196 --> 38:54.930
Well, Nancy, you've been
through hell and then some.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.966
I was hoping we would have
better news for you tonight,

38:56.968 --> 38:58.468
but now I'm gonna answer
your big question.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.969
Can you stay here?

38:59.971 --> 39:02.005
And if so,
what's it gonna take?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.740
And for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.748
I think
you know what's coming.

39:11.750 --> 39:16.185
You absolutely just
can't stay here.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.854
The environmental factors
alone,

39:18.856 --> 39:22.625
and what it has done
to your body,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.894
and what it would continue
to do to your body,

39:24.896 --> 39:28.164
it's just
not healthy for you.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.535
So with that being said,
the first thing

39:32.537 --> 39:35.538
I'd like you to do
is to relocate.

39:39.945 --> 39:43.379
The second thing that
you need to do is to have

39:43.381 --> 39:47.517
a reiki master and
a psychic knower come

39:47.519 --> 39:53.022
on the day that you're going
to leave the house forever.

39:53.024 --> 39:57.326
The reiki master needs
to remove the dead woman

39:57.328 --> 39:58.528
from your back

39:58.530 --> 40:01.731
and then proceed
to cut all attachments.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.802
Once she's removed,
then the psychic knower

40:05.804 --> 40:10.940
will then get her
gone, moved over.

40:10.942 --> 40:16.312
This is gonna be difficult.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.353
Listen, you can do
everything you're doing

40:23.355 --> 40:24.720
at this house
someplace else.

40:24.722 --> 40:26.755
Yeah.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.291
I know it's not what
you want to hear, Nancy,

40:28.293 --> 40:30.393
but you cannot get
any worse than this.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.496
This is horrific
and terrifying,

40:33.498 --> 40:35.832
and you can live the rest
of your life sick,

40:35.834 --> 40:38.201
or you can take a chance
and maybe start over.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.305
You can do this.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.473
You're near death.
You understand that, right?

40:44.475 --> 40:46.442
This ain't a joke.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.644
My God.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.978
I just didn't know
how bad it was.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.679
I know it's a hard
pill to swallow,

40:50.681 --> 40:52.382
and it's a lot to
ask of you right now,

40:52.384 --> 40:53.783
but are you gonna
take a word of advice

40:53.785 --> 40:56.252
and get the hell out
of this freaking place?

40:56.254 --> 40:58.454
God.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.933
Yes.
- Okay.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.800
- You gonna help her out, Nicole?
- Of course.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.069
I've always been there
for her.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.237
We got a start.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.906
We got a compass now,
we got a start,

41:16.908 --> 41:19.609
and we'll get you
through it.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.378
I'm sure I can
find another place.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.485
Thank you.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.453
It's never easy
telling someone

41:31.455 --> 41:32.988
they need to leave their home.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.691
But in this case,
it's the only option.

41:35.693 --> 41:38.361
If Nancy does move
out and gets the help

41:38.363 --> 41:40.997
of a reiki master
and a psychic knower,

41:40.999 --> 41:43.699
she can free herself
of negative attachments

41:43.701 --> 41:46.035
and begin a fresh
start someplace new.
