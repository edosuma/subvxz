WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:28.208
we're so adventurous

00:28.208 --> 00:31.583
and again

00:31.583 --> 00:35.083
and there's nobody home

00:35.083 --> 00:38.500
to count on a friend

00:38.500 --> 00:42.083
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:44.000 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.958
I gotta be there

00:50.875 --> 00:55.291
Winnie the Pooh

01:06.458 --> 01:09.833
Pooh:

01:09.833 --> 01:13.083
Ahh. It's always nice
to start off the day

01:13.083 --> 01:14.833
with a well balanced
breakfast.

01:20.291 --> 01:24.458
Perhaps breakfast wasn't
as balanced as I thought.

01:24.458 --> 01:26.833
I know what's the matter.

01:26.833 --> 01:28.458
I haven't had dessert.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.875
Why, my paw seems to have

01:36.875 --> 01:38.375
forgotten it's way
to my mouth.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.000
I wonder who that can be?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.458
Good morning,
Pooh Bear.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.708
Thought we'd join you
for breakfast.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.833
Thank you all,

01:48.833 --> 01:50.833
but I'm afraid
you may have to find

01:50.833 --> 01:52.708
someone else to
eat all this honey.

01:54.291 --> 01:57.291
I can't seem to
eat honey anymore.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.000
All: Can't eat honey?!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.625
Tigger:
That's ridickerous.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.458
Pooh bears always
have room for honey.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.500
Ohh. You see what I mean?

02:07.500 --> 02:10.208
This is serious.

02:10.208 --> 02:13.333
Pooh has never lost
his appetite before.

02:13.333 --> 02:18.000
I suppose a lost appetite
should be very easy to find.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.875
Especially one
as big as yours.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.750
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:21.750 --> 02:24.500
All we have to know is
where you left it.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.708
Perhaps Owl knows.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.458
Yeah,
he's always gettin'
lost in thought.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.375
Whoo, can't eat honey?

02:33.375 --> 02:38.333
I say,
that doesn't sound like
the Pooh Bear I know.

02:38.333 --> 02:42.166
Are you absolutely certain
that this is in fact

02:42.166 --> 02:43.375
Winnie the Pooh?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.583
I think I'm me.

02:45.583 --> 02:50.083
Hmm. Pooh Bear is missin',
and so's his appetite.

02:50.083 --> 02:53.083
It's a regular crime wave.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.083
And somebody's
gotta wave back.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.000
This is a job for...

02:57.000 --> 02:59.083
Tigger, private ear.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.208
Are you now
or have you ever been

03:03.208 --> 03:04.958
any Pooh Bear
generally known

03:04.958 --> 03:07.583
and publicly recogonized
as Winnie the Pooh?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.875
Oh! Were you
speaking to me?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.625
Not sure, eh?

03:13.625 --> 03:16.000
All right.
Whoever you are,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.125
spill the beans.

03:18.125 --> 03:21.083
Why, I haven't got
any beans, Tigger.

03:21.083 --> 03:24.500
Uh, perhaps Rabbit
has some in his garden.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.583
What have you got to say
about that, long ears?

03:27.583 --> 03:31.125
Why, yes.
I have beans
in my garden.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.875
But I'd never
spill them.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.458
Just a ding-dang minute!

03:35.458 --> 03:37.750
Rabbit's not the one
on trial here.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.083
Oh, yeah.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.083
I was just testin' ya.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.750
What did you do with
our pal Pooh, Pooh?

03:44.750 --> 03:47.583
I'm sure I'm around here
somewhere.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.833
He certainly looks
like Pooh Bear.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.750
Jumpin' crawdaddies!

03:52.750 --> 03:55.458
He must be wearin'
a disguise.

03:55.458 --> 03:58.458
Hmm. He does look
a great deal larger

03:58.458 --> 04:00.250
than the Pooh I know.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.583
It's time for some
scientifical private earin'.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.750
Now we'll see
who's buddy bear
and who isn't.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.833
The real Pooh
could never resist

04:08.833 --> 04:11.083
a smackerel
of something sweet.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.875
So, uh,
how about some honey,
bunny boy?

04:14.875 --> 04:16.000
No, thank you,
Tigger,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.750
I've already had
my breakfast.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.458
Hmm.
Pooh's not in there.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.416
How about you,
whoever you are?

04:23.416 --> 04:26.583
Some sweet,
golden honey, hmm?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.125
Uh, no, thank you,
Tigger.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.458
I just brushed my teeth.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.291
I know. I bet
old buddy bear's hidin'

04:33.291 --> 04:35.125
where you'd
least expect it.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.000
In buddy bear!

04:37.000 --> 04:39.958
No, there's
nothing in there I want.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.458
A-ha! It's Owl.
I mean, it's Pooh!

04:44.458 --> 04:46.291
I mean--

04:46.291 --> 04:47.458
You know what I mean.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.000
I, uh--
Whoo, I--

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Eh, I never
would have guessed
Owl was Pooh.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.125
Oh, dear.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.500
I do seem to have an
attraction for honey,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.291
don't I?

05:00.291 --> 05:02.958
I must be Pooh.

05:02.958 --> 05:04.208
Oh, bother.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.333
But then where's Owl?

05:06.333 --> 05:09.208
There's certainly not room
for both of us in there.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.416
Well, I'm not Owl.

05:11.416 --> 05:14.583
Oh, I couldn't be Owl.
I'm afraid of heights.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.500
I've never
heard of anything

05:16.500 --> 05:18.708
so silly
in all my life.

05:18.708 --> 05:22.333
My family's
always been gophers,

05:22.333 --> 05:24.708
all the way back to
great uncle Sidney.

05:24.708 --> 05:27.458
Why, that reminds me
of the time--

05:27.458 --> 05:31.208
Ahh!
I'm talkin' just like Owl.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.708
This is getting
very confusing.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.875
If I'm in Owl,

05:34.875 --> 05:38.583
and Owl is in Gopher,
then--

05:38.583 --> 05:39.708
Where's Gopher?

05:39.708 --> 05:42.583
Hmm. He's gonna be
hard to find,

05:42.583 --> 05:45.375
on account of
because he's so small.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.750
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.583
I'm sorry, Gopher,
but I must be you.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.875
I didn't mean to be.

05:50.875 --> 05:54.208
All right,
who's next?

05:54.208 --> 05:55.875
Don't be ridiculous.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.500
I can't be Piglet.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.000
What would happen
to my garden?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.750
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.083
Oh, no!

06:03.083 --> 06:04.500
I have a very
large feeling

06:04.500 --> 06:06.708
I'm a very small animal.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.375
Now, let me see.

06:08.375 --> 06:09.958
I lost my appetite,

06:09.958 --> 06:11.708
and then I lost me,

06:11.708 --> 06:14.708
and now my friends
are lost, sort of.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.083
What should I,
whoever I am, do?

06:18.083 --> 06:20.083
Any private ear
can tell ya that.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.750
Find your appetite,
and abra-candelabra,

06:23.750 --> 06:25.708
ya find your friends.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.000
Uh, b-b-but please hurry,
uh, whoever you are.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.708
Being such a
very small animal

06:30.708 --> 06:32.500
certainly is scary.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.208
No time for fiddle faddle,
sonny.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.833
Let's get moving.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.416
Ohh, yes.

06:39.416 --> 06:42.375
It is almost time for
something to eat.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.416
Isn't it?

06:43.416 --> 06:45.458
Say, where's Gopher?

06:45.458 --> 06:47.000
Uh, I mean, Owl?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.833
Well, time to flap
the flight fantastic.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.583
Ahhh!

06:53.583 --> 06:57.458
Hm. This reminds me of
the time my Uncle Torbit

06:57.458 --> 07:00.583
mistook a plum pudding
for a birdbath.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.000
Come on, stranger.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.583
We better find
that appetite of yours

07:03.583 --> 07:05.333
before this gets
so confusin'

07:05.333 --> 07:07.000
even I can't
figure it out.

07:08.458 --> 07:11.458
Tiptoeing would be
a great deal easier

07:11.458 --> 07:17.708
if you knew what it is
that you're trying not to
step iiii-in!

07:19.583 --> 07:20.958
Dagnabbit!

07:20.958 --> 07:23.250
What's goin' on here,
sonny?

07:23.250 --> 07:25.458
How am I supposed to find
a missing appetite

07:25.458 --> 07:29.375
when folks are always
droppin' in unexpectedly?

07:29.375 --> 07:31.458
I don't know exactly
what it is,

07:31.458 --> 07:34.458
but Gopher
doesn't seem to be
himself today.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.458
Listen.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.166
Owl: Uh...

07:38.166 --> 07:41.333
just another smackerel,
if you please.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.333
That's a Pooh Bear's
appetite

07:43.333 --> 07:45.000
if I ever
private eared one.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.625
Okay, appetite,
hands up!

07:50.875 --> 07:54.291
Your tummy has
come to get you.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.458
Yipes!

07:55.458 --> 07:57.208
Ooh, company.

07:57.208 --> 08:00.750
And you're just in time
for breakfast.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.458
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.083
Don't be afraid,
Piglet.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.333
It's just our friends
Tigger and, uh... me.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.000
Uh, if that door
had been open,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.208
it would have been
a perfect landing.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.208
Pooh Bear.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.208
Both: Yes?

08:24.500 --> 08:29.083
I may have discovered
the whereabouts of your
appetite.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.333
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
A clue.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.291
Take us to it
so I can get you all
back to abnormal.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.250
Follow me!

08:36.250 --> 08:37.875
Well, here you are.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.583
Thank you, Gopher,

08:39.583 --> 08:43.250
for being Owl and taking me
to wherever my appetite is.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.958
Where is it?

08:44.958 --> 08:48.000
It's right in there
where Pooh would be

08:48.000 --> 08:49.208
if he was Pooh.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.291
Well, if you'll excuse me,

08:51.291 --> 08:53.000
I really must be going.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.208
Lots of things to do,
you know.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.875
Uh, that reminds me of
one of the things

09:03.875 --> 09:06.208
I didn't want to do again.

09:06.958 --> 09:10.875
Hello-ohhh!

09:10.875 --> 09:14.458
Do you think my appetite's
really down there, Tigger?

09:14.458 --> 09:16.750
There's only one way
to find out.

09:16.750 --> 09:21.750
Oh, bother!

09:25.458 --> 09:27.208
Oh, my.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.125
I certainly hope
my appetite is nearby.

09:30.125 --> 09:33.416
It would be a shame
to have found all this honey,

09:33.416 --> 09:36.416
and not be able to
enjoy it.

09:36.416 --> 09:39.416
Hello, Piglet.
Uh, Gopher.

09:39.416 --> 09:40.708
Uh, what are you
doing here?

09:41.750 --> 09:43.458
I was just tunneling by,

09:43.458 --> 09:47.458
and thought I'd see what
all the b-b-b-brewhaha
was about.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.583
Tunneling by?

09:49.583 --> 09:54.833
Oh, bother!

10:00.500 --> 10:02.375
Thank you, Piglet.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.375
I mean, Gopher.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.833
I just wish...

10:06.833 --> 10:08.958
I'd been able to find
my appetite.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.458
You know, sonny,
for someone with
no appetite,

10:13.458 --> 10:16.500
you're sure eatin'
a lot of honey.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.625
My appetite!

10:18.625 --> 10:21.291
It must have been in
the honey tree after all,

10:21.291 --> 10:24.625
just like Gopher--
I mean Owl, said.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.333
Does that mean I'm not
Gopher anymore?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.291
Yes, Piglet.

10:29.291 --> 10:32.958
Everyone is
who they weren't
but are really.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.333
All we have to do now

10:34.333 --> 10:39.708
is find a way down
from this honeeeey!

10:41.875 --> 10:44.333
Tigger:
Yet another
mystical type mystery

10:44.333 --> 10:46.875
solved by the defender
of the weakly,

10:46.875 --> 10:49.000
the champion of
the undercooked,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.208
the sleuther of
the unsleuthable,

10:51.208 --> 10:53.291
and general
all around nice guy,

10:53.291 --> 10:56.458
Tigger,
private ear!

10:56.458 --> 10:59.000
It certainly is nice
to have everybody
back to being--

10:59.000 --> 11:00.833
Everybody.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.625
Aww, shucks.
It was kind of fun

11:02.625 --> 11:04.500
when anybody
was nobody,

11:04.500 --> 11:06.625
and everybody was
who they thought
they weren't.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.875
That's easy
for you to say, Tigger.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.708
You didn't
have to be anybody.

11:10.708 --> 11:13.875
I certainly am glad
I got my appetite back.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.083
I was beginning to get
very hungry.

11:18.083 --> 11:21.000
But, you know, I have
the strangest feeling

11:21.000 --> 11:22.708
that we forgot something.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.458
Gopher: Dagnabbit!

11:39.208 --> 11:42.500
My, isn't this
a lovely day
for a picnic?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.583
Well, when my ears
wigwag like this,

11:45.583 --> 11:49.708
it means
it's going to rain
cats and dogs.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.000
Oh, bother.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.083
I hope they bring
their own lunch.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.125
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Them ears of yours

11:55.125 --> 11:57.083
must be on the fritz,
bunny boy.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.583
'Cause the only thing
them clouds are full of

11:59.583 --> 12:01.208
is sunshine.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.000
Just to make sure
the picnic won't get rusty,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.833
I'll grab a closer look.

12:05.833 --> 12:08.333
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:09.708 --> 12:13.458
Oh, dear.
What if he never comes down?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.375
Oh, nonsense.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.958
Tigger wouldn't
dream of missing

12:16.958 --> 12:19.250
my latest
vegetable masterpiece.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.333
I call it
carrotà la carte.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.750
Pooh, this is
t-t-t-terrible.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.958
Oh, I don't think so,
Piglet.

12:32.958 --> 12:35.708
I still have
a small smackerel.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.000
Yoo-hoo!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Honey!

12:39.000 --> 12:41.166
Piglet!

12:41.166 --> 12:43.458
Oh, dear.
Pooh, Rabbit, Tigger,

12:43.458 --> 12:44.458
where are you?

12:46.375 --> 12:48.458
Help! Pooh!

12:48.458 --> 12:50.166
Help!

12:50.166 --> 12:51.416
Pooh, help!

12:51.416 --> 12:52.500
Where are you?

12:52.500 --> 12:55.583
Piglet,
where are you not going

12:55.583 --> 12:57.458
in such a hurry?

12:59.250 --> 13:01.125
I dreamed we were
on a picnic,

13:01.125 --> 13:03.583
and I lost you,
Rabbit and Tigger.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.458
I hope my dream
never comes true.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.958
Of course it won't
come true, Piglet.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.625
A dream can't come true
while you're awake.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.625
Are you sure, Pooh?

13:15.625 --> 13:18.375
As sure as it's
time for breakfast.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.750
My, my,
today simply flew by.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.583
I'm looking forward
to bedtime.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.083
Bedtime?

13:30.083 --> 13:31.958
Yeah, you know,
Piglet.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.833
Bed. Sleepy by.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.375
Dreams.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.416
Dreams?

13:37.416 --> 13:38.875
Oh, dear.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.583
But it's really
quite early yet.

13:41.583 --> 13:46.166
It certainly seems like
an awfully late early to me.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.000
W-Why not at all, Pooh.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.208
I-I'm sure there's someone
in the 100 Acre Wood

13:50.208 --> 13:52.083
just sitting down
to breakfast.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.458
Breakfast?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.500
But it's too early
for breakfast.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.208
There's only one way
to find out for sure.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.333
Is it time for be yet?

14:03.333 --> 14:05.166
Piglet: Why,
of course not, Rabbit.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.083
We're hardly done
with breakfast.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.500
There's a whole new day
ahead of us.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.458
A new day?

14:11.458 --> 14:14.583
Oh, Rabbit,
you wouldn't happen to have

14:14.583 --> 14:16.833
a very small something to--

14:16.833 --> 14:18.458
All I have,
Pooh Bear,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.875
is a very large mess
to clean up.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.708
Oh, don't worry about
a thing, Rabbit.

14:23.708 --> 14:26.250
Pooh, Tigger and I
will help you clean up.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.750
There's lots of things
we can do

14:27.750 --> 14:29.208
besides go to bed.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.708
You're right,
little Piglet.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.125
And we can celebrate with
a picnic when we're done.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.875
Picnic?

14:34.875 --> 14:37.416
Well,
I don't think a picnic
is a good idea.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.458
When my ears
twitch like this,

14:39.458 --> 14:41.208
it's a sure sign of rain.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.750
Ears? Rain?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.208
Oh, dear!

14:49.250 --> 14:51.458
It certainly is
a very small bed

14:51.458 --> 14:53.208
for such a very
frightening dream.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.750
Hello, Piglet.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.708
You ran away
so quickly,

14:59.708 --> 15:01.958
I forgot to say
goodnight.

15:01.958 --> 15:04.458
Goodnight,
and pleasant dreams.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.583
Dreams? Yipes!

15:06.583 --> 15:07.958
No, Pooh, don't leave.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.958
It's not going to be
a good night.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.708
I'm afraid to go to sleep,

15:11.708 --> 15:14.250
'cause when I wake up,
my dream will have come true,

15:14.250 --> 15:16.291
and I'll be left all alone.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.083
Well, perhaps
that won't happen

15:18.083 --> 15:20.708
if I stay awake
with you tonight.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.166
Oh, Pooh, would you?

15:23.166 --> 15:25.166
I'm sure the dream
will find it

15:25.166 --> 15:28.291
much too crowded here
and go away.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.708
Perhaps we should discuss
something cheerful

15:32.708 --> 15:35.458
to keep ourselves up.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.375
Like honey.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.833
Hives.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.125
Bees.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.375
Oh, dear.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.500
Mmm.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.458
Oh, bother.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.833
This staying awake all night
is awfully hard work,

15:57.833 --> 15:59.125
isn't it, Piglet?

15:59.125 --> 16:02.000
Yes, Pooh, it is.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.958
I don't suppose
a teeny tiny nap
could be arranged?

16:06.958 --> 16:10.166
After all,
whoever heard of
a nightmare

16:10.166 --> 16:12.250
coming true
in the daytime?

16:13.375 --> 16:15.250
But we can't sleep now,
Pooh.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.000
We promised Rabbit we'd
help clean up his house.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.458
And a promise is
a promise after all.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.166
I must stay awake

16:26.166 --> 16:27.875
so that dream won't take
my friends away.

16:29.375 --> 16:32.000
If Piglet doesn't get
some rest soon,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.166
he's going to
wear me out.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.583
But he's afraid
to go to sleep.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.375
He had a scary dream.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.875
We're going to have to
get Piglet napping

16:41.875 --> 16:43.708
without him
knowing it.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.708
I know.

16:45.708 --> 16:48.583
Counting sheep
will do it every time.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.250
But we haven't got
any sheep.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.708
Don't worry, Pooh Bear.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.833
Pullin' the wool
over Piglet's eyes

16:54.833 --> 16:56.583
is what Tiggers do
the best.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.000
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:59.000 --> 17:01.708
You know, Piglet,
if you look hard enough,

17:01.708 --> 17:05.250
you might see
more than just corn
in this field.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.291
Baa.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

17:07.291 --> 17:08.708
- Baa, baa.
- Look, Piglet.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.375
There's a sheep.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.750
And another.
And another.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.125
I wonder
how many there are?

17:15.125 --> 17:16.375
There's one.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.708
That's one.

17:17.708 --> 17:18.708
There's another one.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.583
Oh, dear, Tigger?

17:23.583 --> 17:27.291
Sorry, little Piglet,
but if this keeps up,

17:27.291 --> 17:29.958
I'll be snoozin'
before you will.

17:29.958 --> 17:32.958
Do you feel
at all sleepy,
Piglet?

17:32.958 --> 17:35.500
No, not a bit.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.333
Now,
if you'll all excuse me,

17:37.333 --> 17:40.250
I'm gonna go take a nice
five hour ice cold bath.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.333
Well, what are we
going to do?

17:44.333 --> 17:48.083
If staying awake
makes Piglet feel safe,

17:48.083 --> 17:51.125
perhaps we should just
make him think he's asleep.

17:51.125 --> 17:56.333
Yes. Then we can show him
he's not going to lose us.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.875
What a wonderful idea,
Pooh.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.958
We both know
I'm never going to
sleep in you again.

18:05.958 --> 18:08.166
Bouncers away!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.583
Am I dreaming?

18:12.583 --> 18:15.333
Not yet, but sure as
shootin' stars,

18:15.333 --> 18:16.416
you will be,

18:16.416 --> 18:18.291
'cause I'm the sandman.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.708
Oh, no.
I must be asleep.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.333
Nighty night.
Don't let the
beddy bugs bite.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.708
And now's our chance.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.083
Why, hello, Piglet.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.208
Are you ready to go
on your picnic?

18:31.208 --> 18:33.125
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.125
The dream.
It's back.

18:35.125 --> 18:39.208
Oh, my.
There's going to be
an awful storm.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.458
Ohh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.000
Great goin',
bunny boy.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.583
You almost
got me fooled.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.625
- I'm not kidding, Tigger.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.458
There's going to be
a monstrous storm.

18:49.458 --> 18:52.500
Anything you say,
long ears.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.875
Okay, buddy bear,
you're on.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.333
Goodness me.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.958
Where has everyone gone?

19:00.958 --> 19:03.125
I do wish someone--

19:03.125 --> 19:05.708
preferably
a very small someone--

19:05.708 --> 19:07.375
would find me.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.458
Ooh! Oh, bother.

19:10.458 --> 19:15.000
Say, I don't remember us
puttin' that in Piglet's dream.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Oh, we didn't.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.833
Oh, this dream is
even worse than
the last time.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.708
It is?

19:21.708 --> 19:25.208
Yes, and you'll
all be leaving me
any moment now.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.000
Don't worry, Piglet.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.875
We're not
going to leave you,

19:28.875 --> 19:31.000
because this is not--

19:39.708 --> 19:43.708
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:43.708 --> 19:47.166
Oh, no.
There goes Tigger.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.458
Help!

19:49.458 --> 19:51.500
And Rabbit.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.166
Oh, Pooh,
don't let go.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.875
Don't worry, Piglet.
I can't let go.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.208
I'm not hanging on.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.125
Oh, bother!

20:03.250 --> 20:04.708
Oh, dear.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.083
I've been left all alone.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.416
Guess I'd better get used to
talking to myself,

20:10.416 --> 20:13.583
since I dreamed
all of my friends
out of existence.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.958
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

20:15.958 --> 20:17.000
Piglet: Tigger?

20:18.958 --> 20:21.375
Piglet.
You found me.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.250
Say, where are
Pooh boy and Rabbit?

20:24.250 --> 20:26.750
Oh, dear.
Come along, Tigger.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.458
We'd better find them
before my dream ends,

20:28.458 --> 20:29.875
and they're lost forever.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.875
Um, uh, uh, Piglet,

20:31.875 --> 20:33.583
there's somethin'
you oughta know.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.625
Not now, Tigger.
We have to hurry.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.333
Tigger:
Are you sure we'll find
long ears in this mess?

20:39.333 --> 20:40.833
Oh, yes.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.583
If we find carrots,
we'll find Rabbit.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.000
Ooh, look.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.125
Oh, my.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.833
Rabbit,
are you all right?

20:50.833 --> 20:55.458
Yes. And I'm certainly glad
you found me, Piglet.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.291
This certainly is
a strange dream.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.833
Where's Pooh?

20:58.833 --> 21:01.458
Well,
according to my dream,

21:01.458 --> 21:04.208
he's stuck inside
his honey pot somewhere.

21:04.208 --> 21:06.291
Yeah, but Piglet,
this isn't a--

21:06.291 --> 21:09.958
Pooh:
Yoo-hoo! Hello.

21:09.958 --> 21:12.083
Has anyone seen...

21:12.083 --> 21:13.458
anything?

21:13.458 --> 21:15.750
- My.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.083
Pooh. Oh, Pooh,
I did it.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.875
And I found you all.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.958
I wouldn't mind at all
if this dream came true.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.375
But your dream
did come true, Piglet.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.833
Well, you see,
little Piglet,

21:29.833 --> 21:33.000
your dream,
which was really our dream,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.166
uh, which turned out
not to be a dream after all,

21:36.166 --> 21:37.333
came true.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.500
- It did?
- Yes.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.875
And you lived
happily ever after.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.625
And just in time
for breakfast.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.708
Now you can go to sleep
without being scared, Piglet.

21:51.708 --> 21:53.333
That's because
I know my friends

21:53.333 --> 21:55.875
will always be here
when the dream ends.

21:55.875 --> 21:59.250
Yeah. Any snoozer
under the sun knows

21:59.250 --> 22:02.625
that friends are real
and dreams ain't.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.708
What do you think,
Pooh?
