[rock music]

00:03.237 --> 00:04.970
Girls,
I need your attention.

00:04.972 --> 00:08.340
You also need a booster seat
for most places.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.377
No, I came out
to tell you some big news.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.412
You also came out
when you wore that sweater

00:13.414 --> 00:15.314
to work today.

00:15.316 --> 00:18.917
John Mayer wore
this sweater in<i> Details.</i>

00:18.919 --> 00:21.820
Tonight, we are trying
family-style service.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.655
I thought family-style service
was what I had to do

00:23.657 --> 00:26.358
with my uncle.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.561
Well, my family-style is
more "potluck"--

00:29.563 --> 00:34.366
heavy on the pot,
not so heavy on the luck.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.369
Why would a family come here?

00:37.371 --> 00:40.706
If I see a child in here,
I'm calling the police.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.109
It's like seeing a dog
locked in a hot car.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.979
Chicken cacciatore ,
family-style.

00:46.981 --> 00:49.415
Liver and onions,
family-style.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.551
Spaghetti and meatballs,
my family-style,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.120
which means the balls are
kinda small,

00:55.122 --> 00:59.591
but the noodles
are extra long.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.394
You bring out the food
in large bowls

01:02.396 --> 01:04.329
and the customers
serve themselves,

01:04.331 --> 01:08.100
as they've been doing
since I hired you two.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.735
Good idea, Han.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.737
The diner food
does belong in a big bowl--

01:11.739 --> 01:15.140
the toilet bowl.

01:15.142 --> 01:19.845
I don't know what
your uncle saw in you.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.181

Ooh Ooh ¶

01:33.194 --> 01:34.860
Max, I just
found something

01:34.862 --> 01:36.662
very upsetting
on my phone.

01:36.664 --> 01:40.065
Another free U2 album?

01:40.067 --> 01:41.567
Worse.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.269
And worse than an e-vite
to a friend's improv show.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.540
It's an e-mail
from the managing director

01:48.542 --> 01:51.076
of all The High restaurants
saying he's seen our sales

01:51.078 --> 01:53.445
and is disappointed
with my performance.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.682
Duh-lete...

01:56.684 --> 01:58.016
like I do with all

01:58.018 --> 01:59.751
the "disappointed
in your performance" texts

01:59.753 --> 02:02.354
I get from guys after sex.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.290
Sorry, gents!
My boobs make a promise

02:05.292 --> 02:08.327
my bad back can't deliver.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.396
Those bad sales numbers
are not our fault.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.332
Our unit's out
at the airport.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.633
Well, I'm not taking
ownership of this

02:14.635 --> 02:16.535
because my unit is not
at the airport.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.404
It's in my bed table drawer.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.274
I'm the manager.
It's on me.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.577
As is this tartar stain.
It just refuses to come out.

02:25.579 --> 02:29.281
You'd think
it's parents were Baptist.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.682
[bell rings]

02:30.684 --> 02:32.518
Well, Manager,
I need to get out of there

02:32.520 --> 02:34.353
early tomorrow
to do Sophie's wedding cake,

02:34.355 --> 02:37.890
and also because
you're annoying as a boss.

02:37.892 --> 02:40.259
Hey, everybody!

02:42.296 --> 02:47.900
Me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me, me...

02:47.902 --> 02:51.503
I love being a bride.
You don't even have to pretend

02:51.505 --> 02:54.373
it's about anyone else.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.475
Kinda like me,
when I was rich.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.611
Pretty much
every single day still.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.214
Good news, bad news.
The good news is

03:02.216 --> 03:08.053
the rash is
not spreading past my nuts.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.290
And that's the good news.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.559
Bad news--
the wedding donkey we booked

03:13.561 --> 03:17.095
for the church service died.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.264
I'll ask
the obvious question.

03:19.266 --> 03:23.302
Did it have anything
to do with the rash?

03:23.304 --> 03:24.970
I mean, what are we gonna do?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.605
It's not a traditional
Polish wedding

03:26.607 --> 03:30.242
without an ass walking
down the aisle.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.779
I think Oleg's
got that covered.

03:33.781 --> 03:37.249
Girls, we need an ass,
you have a horse--

03:37.251 --> 03:39.184
same family,
but not related,

03:39.186 --> 03:43.589
like the Jolie-Pitt kids.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.024
No way.
Chestnut is my baby.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.894
Well, the donkey was getting
a thousand bucks.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.829
Baby's gotta work.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.031
[rock music]

03:53.033 --> 03:55.033
Wow, business is slower
than the third season

03:55.035 --> 03:58.337
of<i> House of Cards.</i>

03:58.339 --> 04:00.072
You know what's doing
great business?

04:00.074 --> 04:03.875
It's my new Grindr profile.

04:03.877 --> 04:08.847
Changed my screen name
to "Suction Junction".

04:08.849 --> 04:11.950
That damn Cinnabon next door
is taking all our business.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.019
What kind of low lives
would prefer those

04:14.021 --> 04:16.588
to these fine desserts?

04:16.590 --> 04:19.958
I found a secret pathway
to the Cinnabon kitchen!

04:19.960 --> 04:23.462
Move, bitch!

04:23.464 --> 04:26.365
Really? You too?
I just don't get.

04:26.367 --> 04:30.435
It's an acquired taste,
like crystal meth.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.837
[cell phone chimes]

04:31.839 --> 04:33.005
Ugh.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.941
Great. My waiter's
gonna be late again.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.643
"Held up at the TSA line."

04:37.645 --> 04:39.645
That's what I get
for hiring an airport waiter

04:39.647 --> 04:41.913
named Mohammed Machdinajihad.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.685
Oh, look, Ronnie,
a new place.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.921
I see it, Bonnie,
I'm right next to you.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.090
Didn't this used to be
the bar we got wasted in

04:52.092 --> 04:53.458
before our flights?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.060
I can't remember.
I was wasted.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.495
[both laugh]

04:56.497 --> 04:57.796
Welcome to The High--

04:57.798 --> 05:00.666
the finest
in high quality desserts.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.035
We also have yogurts,
cappuccinos, lattes, coffee,

05:03.037 --> 05:04.436
herb teas, or smart waters.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.472
And did I mention
we're a Boingo Hotspot?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.474
Take it down a notch.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.076
You're selling it harder
than Anne Hathaway

05:11.078 --> 05:12.911
on<i> The Tonight Show.</i>

05:12.913 --> 05:15.414
Oh, hi, I'm not here to buy,
just to look.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.451
On a diet...since 1998.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.886
Oh dear lord,
those look amazing.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.988
- Can I just smell a piece?
- Bonnie, don't.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.257
It'll get you going,
and then halfway to Paris,

05:25.259 --> 05:28.827
I'll find you in coach binging
on a bag of Sun Chips.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.829
That's my favorite thing
about the job.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.532
[both laughing]

05:33.534 --> 05:35.334
Oh, Paris reminds me.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.035
I bought two first class
tickets to Paris--

05:37.037 --> 05:39.037
on three credit cards
that will escalate 20%

05:39.039 --> 05:40.706
over six years--anyway...

05:40.708 --> 05:42.207
I really need to return them.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.842
What's the window
on that with your airline?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.244
A month--about the same
amount of time I have

05:46.246 --> 05:49.481
until this fake smile
finally falls off my face.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.249
Lady, we're
flight attendants.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.751
If that smile
falls off your face,

05:52.753 --> 05:56.088
you're gonna have to
get a job at Southwest.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.723
Why are you returning them?
You don't like Paris?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.292
<i>J'adore</i> Paris,
but long story short--

06:00.294 --> 06:02.160
Uh, I'll make it short
because she's incapable

06:02.162 --> 06:04.963
and will throw in lots more
of that fake French.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.598
Bought the tickets
so that I could get to the gate

06:06.600 --> 06:08.266
to see a guy I was banging.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.768
I hear ya.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.636
I once hid in the luggage
cart for 12 hours

06:11.638 --> 06:13.071
to do it
with this cute guy

06:13.073 --> 06:14.406
who works at Customs here.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.042
Oh, right. Rick.
What's he doing now?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.477
Me, every third Tuesday.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.645
[laughing]

06:20.647 --> 06:22.881
Ahh, don't leave me
hanging, ladies.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.516
Ah. If we hadn't
just read<i> Lean In</i>

06:24.518 --> 06:27.219
in our wine club--
I mean book club--

06:27.221 --> 06:29.121
We'd be real jealous
of you gals.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.423
We always had a dream
to open a shop at the airport.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.758
Well, whatever it is,
just don't open

06:32.760 --> 06:34.726
near a Cinnabon
because failure smells

06:34.728 --> 06:37.329
a hell of a lot
like cinnamon.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.663
(female voice)
Final boarding call

06:38.665 --> 06:40.799
for flight 24 to Paris.
Final boarding call.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.268
Final boarding call?
We better hurry.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.804
[both laughing]

06:49.243 --> 06:52.244
[instrumental music]

06:55.315 --> 06:57.949
Wow, everything looks
so much smaller in here

06:57.951 --> 06:59.684
than I remembered it.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.353
Like returning
to your old high school...

07:01.355 --> 07:04.689
or your old high school
boyfriend's penis.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.926
Not mine.
I went to an urban high school.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.196
What's that weird smell?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.565
Probably that milk.
It's been in here so long,

07:13.567 --> 07:17.035
its own photo was
on the carton.

07:17.037 --> 07:23.108
No, it's over here.
Really pungent.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.876
Yes!

07:30.217 --> 07:35.554
Mm--
I might owe you two some rent.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.722
Unless you wanna settle
in weed.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.192
I always wanna
settle in weed.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.094
In fact, I plan
to retire there.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.830
Marijuana's in the closet?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.799
This is more shocking than
Meredith Baxter-Birney.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.104
Look, I figured since you two
abandoned the cupcake shop,

07:53.106 --> 07:54.973
this space was available.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.908
Also, I stopped asking
permission for stuff

07:56.910 --> 07:59.010
when I turned 70.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.812
We did not abandon it.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.781
We just haven't paid attention
to it in 3 months,

08:02.783 --> 08:05.517
like me with any hair
above my mid-thigh.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.718
Tell me about it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.220
When you bend over
in that skirt,

08:08.222 --> 08:10.322
it looks like you're
giving birth to Art Garfunkel.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.530
Me, me, me,
me, me, me, me!

08:18.532 --> 08:21.199
Oh, good.
Earl, you're here.

08:21.201 --> 08:26.571
Yes, I am.
Don't tell any of my ex-wives.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.673
Earl, would you
do me the honor

08:28.675 --> 08:31.376
and walk me down the aisle
tomorrow night?

08:31.378 --> 08:32.844
Sophie, sorry.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.179
I didn't know
your father was dead.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.649
Did he die upon meeting Oleg?

08:37.651 --> 08:39.217
Oh, he's not dead,

08:39.219 --> 08:43.121
but I'm not getting
upstaged by an iron lung.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.725
Well, Earl,
how could you say no

08:46.727 --> 08:49.127
to such a heartfelt request?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.862
I'd be honored, Sophie.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.264
Like the wedding saying goes,

08:52.266 --> 08:54.599
Something old,
something new,

08:54.601 --> 08:55.667
something borrowed,

08:55.669 --> 08:58.970
and someone black.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.872
Oh, Caroline, look.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.008
Here are the pink ribbons
for Chestnut.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.111
Chestnut has to be
covered in girly ribbons?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.046
I can't do that to my boy.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.481
I'll throw in another 50.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.583
I guess there's a reason
"horse" sounds

09:11.585 --> 09:14.085
so much like "whore."

09:14.087 --> 09:17.656
Now, we're all gonna leave
for the church at 6:00,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.891
but I told Earl 4:00,

09:19.893 --> 09:23.361
'cause, well...
You know.

09:29.503 --> 09:32.237
- ¶ Mm-hm hm hmm ¶
- What's happening over there?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.838
Max, you're humming!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.106
[scoffs]
What?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.008
[laughs]
Please...

09:37.010 --> 09:38.209
I am not a hummer.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.377
I mean,
I'll drive in them,

09:39.379 --> 09:43.381
I'll give them,
but I am not one.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.983
[continues humming]

09:44.985 --> 09:47.786
Oh, my God, I am humming!
What's wrong with me?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.221
What am I gonna do next,
smile?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.326
That's right!
Today's special promotion,

09:54.328 --> 09:56.895
in and out in five minutes
or your dessert is half off.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.130
Eat it, Cinnabon.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.633
Pear tart and a coffee.
Come on, I'm on a clock here.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.302
Who had the damn pear tart
and a coffee?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.404
Max, hurry!
Five minutes, in and out!

10:06.406 --> 10:07.906
Yeah, the one thing
you don't have to explain

10:07.908 --> 10:09.941
to me is "in and out."

10:09.943 --> 10:12.010
I need help!
I never said I was fast.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.511
All my high school
guidance counselors did,

10:13.513 --> 10:15.046
but I did not.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.381
I'll go get John
off break

10:16.383 --> 10:17.949
because my waiter
still isn't here.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.184
This whole Middle East
situation

10:19.186 --> 10:21.653
is just so inconvenient
for me.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.857
Okay, now we have
a real situation.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.592
You hit someone.
Damn it, Max.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.894
It's not about me.
It's Sophie.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.229
Her gown arrived
from Poland

10:31.231 --> 10:34.165
and it's stuck
in customs out here.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.734
(Sophie on phone)
My gown!

10:35.736 --> 10:37.302
My beautiful gown!

10:37.304 --> 10:40.672
[screaming]
Oh, my God! My gown!

10:40.674 --> 10:42.674
Wow.
She is really upset.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.009
Really upset,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.645
'cause this isn't
even on speaker.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.116
Yes, it's awful,
but look on the bright side.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.485
Our certain-to-be-hideous
bridesmaids dresses

10:53.487 --> 10:55.020
are stuck in customs too.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.288
No, those arrived.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.391
Damn it!
First, it's the Middle East,

10:59.393 --> 11:00.525
now those dresses.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.927
I cannot catch a break.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.864
Wow, this place is packed.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.599
Remember us?
Bonnie and Ronnie?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.534
We knew you when.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.735
Hey, wait, uh, Ronnie,

11:10.737 --> 11:12.937
didn't you say that
you boned a guy in customs?

11:12.939 --> 11:15.140
That was Bonnie.
I have standards...

11:15.142 --> 11:17.676
and he didn't like me.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.412
To be clear, I did have sex
with the customs guy,

11:20.414 --> 11:21.579
but not in customs.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.816
It was in one of
those family bathrooms.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.651
Look, is there any way
you could help us

11:26.653 --> 11:28.286
get a package out of customs?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.822
Wait...
What bra am I wearing?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.524
Oh, done!

11:32.526 --> 11:33.658
[both laugh]

11:33.660 --> 11:37.262
John, we're leaving.
You're in charge.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.030
Max!
We can't leave right now.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.965
The wedding's not till tonight
and we're in the middle

11:40.967 --> 11:43.101
of a store promotion
and we're losing.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.236
You know I'm
gonna kill you, right?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.871
I just have
to figure out how.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.306
Top contender
is hooking your necklace

11:48.308 --> 11:50.442
on the front gate
and pushing up.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.277
We'll stay
as late as possible.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.146
Just pick up Sophie's dress box
and hop on the subway.

11:55.148 --> 12:00.018
Easy peasy.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.352
(male announcer)
Watch the closing doors, please.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.987
[struggling]
Ugh--oho...

12:02.989 --> 12:05.790
Why is nothing easy peasy?

12:15.469 --> 12:17.702
It's hard not to.
They're about to eat my box.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.872
[mocking laugh]

12:20.874 --> 12:22.173
Yeah, real funny, sir.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.442
A girl said, "Eat my box."
Grow up.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.848
[whimper] Jeez!
How could a dress be this big?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.884
This is just the veil.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.119
I have to get something
out of my bag.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.720
Hold this by yourself
for a second.

12:35.722 --> 12:39.057
[groans]

12:39.059 --> 12:41.459
I can't find it.
Here, take this.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.827
What is this?

12:42.829 --> 12:44.329
A hundred dollars in change.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.864
We need it for the wedding.
It's a Polish custom

12:45.866 --> 12:47.365
to throw change at the bride.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.868
Loose change?
Live animals?

12:49.870 --> 12:53.204
Is this a wedding
or a cock fight?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.572
Max, this is heavy!

12:54.574 --> 12:56.174
What do you have
to get out of your bag?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.710
- Something important.
- What is it?

12:58.712 --> 13:00.945
The rest of my Cinnabon.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.781
Max, that's our competition!

13:02.783 --> 13:04.949
The reason for our failure
is that piece of crap.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.451
I mean, I ca--

13:06.453 --> 13:09.654
Oh, my God,
this is delicious!

13:11.424 --> 13:13.358
No! Max,
he's got the money bag.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.693
[yelp]
[scattering coins]

13:15.695 --> 13:18.563
No--
No! No, no, no!

13:18.565 --> 13:21.199
That is
our Polish bride money!

13:21.201 --> 13:22.600
Back off!

13:22.602 --> 13:24.302
This is not the day
to the screw with me.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.637
I'm at the business bottom

13:25.639 --> 13:28.473
and I've had nothing
to lose since 2011.

would happen next.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.260
What's the hold up
back there?

13:49.262 --> 13:51.596
People are placing bets
that I'm halfway to Reno

13:51.598 --> 13:54.465
with a hooker
and the wedding cash.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.301
Relax.
After that subway,

13:56.303 --> 13:59.070
Max and Caroline needed
some time to freshen up.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.072
They came smelling
like that diner cheese

14:01.074 --> 14:04.742
I tell you all is still good.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.779
Hey, everybody!

14:07.781 --> 14:10.715
We look just like Sophie!
I am so relieved.

14:10.717 --> 14:14.385
I thought I'd be way overdressed
but I'm just under-boobed.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.720
Yeah, we were in a hurry

14:15.722 --> 14:17.722
or I would have loaned her
a cup of mine.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.058
All right.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.393
Oleg, stop looking
at us like that.

14:22.395 --> 14:26.231
It's okay.
I'm marrying you.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.000
You guys look
like the Four Tops.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.237
Well, two tops
and a bottom.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.742
Oleg, Sophie doesn't
want you to see her.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.245
Jump on Chestnut
and start down the aisle.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.213
And Chestnut,
I'm sorry, baby.

14:42.215 --> 14:46.584
I know you never wanted
to do drag.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.554
And, Han, you're supposed
to take this

14:49.556 --> 14:52.490
in case something happens
in the aisle.

14:52.492 --> 14:56.060
This just went
from best man to worst job.

17:10.497 --> 17:15.366
take you, Oleg Golishevsky

Wow, girl,
your fingers work fast.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.821

I need that piece

18:17.063 --> 18:18.496

18:18.498 --> 18:20.064
We just had a close call
in the air.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.300
So close, we gave
the finger to the pilot

18:22.302 --> 18:24.836
in the plane next to us.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.304

18:27.707 --> 18:30.108
"I should have
opened a daycare center!"

We're never gonna
go for our dream,

18:37.750 --> 18:40.551

to get those colonics.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.420
If we really wanted
our own business,

18:42.422 --> 18:45.756
we would have done it already,
like Max and Caroline did.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.026
You're right, we did.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.896

macadamia nut cake we have.

your panties on

19:08.681 --> 19:11.816
Working!
I'm very sick.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.886
Bonnie and Ronnie out there just
reminded me of something.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.488
I mean, besides two aunts
drunk on vacation.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.926
We have our own business.
The High isn't our failure.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.995
We already have
our very own failure

19:23.997 --> 19:26.364
called Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.798
And if we stay here,
we're building

19:27.800 --> 19:30.501
someone else's dream,
not ours.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.636
Also, if we stay,

19:31.638 --> 19:35.039
your ass will be
the size of a house.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.643
I mean, when was the last time
you felt happy here?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.945
Like 30 seconds ago
when you said this place

19:40.947 --> 19:42.914
wasn't our failure
and I remembered I was holding

19:42.916 --> 19:46.617
another one of these
in my other hand.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.085
Let's get out of this airport.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.389
We never have to see another
Nicholas Sparks novel again.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.790
First, we have to get rid

19:52.792 --> 19:54.926
of those two plane tickets
to Paris.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.162
Do we?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.832
I mean, if we're gonna fail

20:01.834 --> 20:04.368
we can still do that after
a week in Paris, right?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.937
Right.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.539
I'm so stoked!
I've never been in first class.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.842
Except, Max,
this is coach.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.011
I got a refund on one ticket
and traded in the other

20:14.013 --> 20:17.114
to buy two coach tickets
and to pay for a cheap hotel.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.350
I'm so stoked.
I've never been in coach.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.018
[giggles]
And also so

20:21.020 --> 20:22.220
we have money to spend.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.022
We should be able
to do Paris for a week on $12.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.758
Of course, we can.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.928
What's the difference between
coach and first, anyway?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.563
The champagne.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.465
We'll be back
with the good crackers,

20:34.467 --> 20:36.167
and I don't mean us.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.135
[both laugh]

20:40.473 --> 20:42.106
Well, partner,
after all we've been

20:42.108 --> 20:44.408
through this year,
whatever comes next,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.277
I kinda feel ready for it.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.113

Flight crew, prepare
for take-off.

Hey, now you're humming.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.288
I am?

21:02.161 --> 21:04.862
Hey, can I trade this in
for a beer?
