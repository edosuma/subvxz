AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.672 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:12.931
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.139 --> 00:18.603
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.686 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:29.447 --> 00:31.407
and flung him into the future,

00:31.533 --> 00:33.952
where my evil is law.

00:34.369 --> 00:38.206
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.540 --> 00:43.002
and undo the future that is Aku.

to me was much more cruel.

denying me a Warrior's end.

'Twas his enjoyment that day
to punish me for eternity.

Thrust me, he did,
into the core of the mountain.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.455
It was his plan for me

15:54.538 --> 15:57.666
to spend all of eternity in the mountain,

15:57.791 --> 16:01.545
never to join my fallen comrades
in Valhalla,

I found a way to manipulate
the material around me.

Out of the rock, I formed the body
thou seest before thee.

16:20.105 --> 16:24.943

so full of peril and danger

of warriors can pass.

is to fall in combat to another warrior.
