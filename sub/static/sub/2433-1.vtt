01:29.840 --> 01:31.549
Mathematicians won the war.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.595
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes

01:36.346 --> 01:37.805
and built the A-bomb.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.017
Mathematicians, like you.

01:42.728 --> 01:46.939
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

01:47.024 --> 01:51.110
In medicine or economics,
in technology or space

01:51.195 --> 01:52.820
battle lines
are being drawn.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.824
To triumph,
we need results,

01:56.909 --> 01:59.327
publishable,
applicable results.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.039
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

02:04.583 --> 02:05.708
The next Einstein?

02:06.585 --> 02:09.669
Who among you
will be the vanguard
of democracy,

02:09.755 --> 02:11.380
freedom, and discovery?

02:12.716 --> 02:16.552
Today,
we bequeath America's future
into your able hands.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.765
Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.409
It's not enough
Hansen won the
Carnegie Scholarship.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.537
No, he has to
have it all for himself.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.791
It's the first time the
Carnegie Prize has been split.
Hansen's all bent.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.126
He's got his
sights set on Wheeler Lab,

02:49.253 --> 02:51.087
the new military
think-tank at MIT.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.881
They're only
taking one this year.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.967
Hansen's used to
being picked first.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.718
Yeah,
he's wasted on math.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.054
He should be running
for president.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.859
There could be
a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.658
Thank you.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.995
Neilson,
symbol cryptography.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.956
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world
of Fascism.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.792
At least that's what
he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

03:30.252 --> 03:32.295
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.838
And you are?
Am I late?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.506
Yes, Mr. Sol.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.258
Good. Hi.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.552
Sol. Richard Sol.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.220
Ah,
the burden of genius.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.263
There he is.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.389
So many supplicants,
and so little time.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.224
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

03:45.309 --> 03:46.684
Bender.
Nice to see you.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.894
Congratulations,
Mr. Hansen.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.103
Thank you.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.480
I'll take another.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.233
Excuse me?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.319
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed
you were the waiter.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.403
Play nice, Hansen.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.030
Nice is not
Hansen's strong suit.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.281
An honest mistake.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.158
Well, Martin Hansen.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.911
It is Martin, isn't it?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.622
Why, yes, John, it is.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.082
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

04:13.545 --> 04:17.839
I've read your preprints,
both of them.

04:18.382 --> 04:22.970
The one on Nazi ciphers
and the other one on
nonlinear equations.

04:23.055 --> 04:26.474
And I am supremely confident
that there is not
a single seminal

04:26.558 --> 04:28.225
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.522
Enjoy your punch.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.490
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,
the mysterious
West Virginia genius.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.910
The other winner
of the distinguished
Carnegie Scholarship.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.328
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, yeah?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.829
Of course.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.238
Oh, Christ.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.992
The prodigal roommate arrives.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.786
Roommate?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.079
Oh, God, no.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.002
Did you know that
having a hangover

05:36.086 --> 05:38.462
is not having enough
water in your body

05:38.547 --> 05:41.132
to run your Krebs cycle?

05:41.216 --> 05:44.468
Which is exactly
what happens to you
when you're dying of thirst.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.888
So, dying of thirst

05:49.266 --> 05:51.851
would probably feel

05:51.935 --> 05:56.439
pretty much like
the hangover that
finally bloody kills you.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.817
John Nash?

05:59.901 --> 06:01.068
Hello.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.030
Charles Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.459
All right! Well done!

06:21.882 --> 06:24.800
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.180
Officer,
I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnnie Walker.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.396
Well, I got in
last night in time

06:37.522 --> 06:39.607
for English
department cocktails.

06:40.776 --> 06:41.776
Cock was mine,

06:41.860 --> 06:44.612
the tail belonged to
a particularly lovely
young thing with a passion

06:46.573 --> 06:50.201
for D. H. Lawrence.
You're not easily
distracted, are you?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.535
I'm here to work.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.788
Are you? Right.
I see. Crikey!

07:04.633 --> 07:06.509
Is my roommate a dick?

07:08.637 --> 07:09.637
Hmm?

07:10.847 --> 07:13.766
Listen. If we can't
break the ice,

07:15.435 --> 07:16.644
how about we drown it?

07:27.531 --> 07:28.906
So what's your story?

07:30.242 --> 07:33.035
You the poor kid
that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

07:34.371 --> 07:37.248
Despite my privileged
upbringing, I'm actually
quite well-balanced.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.833
I have a chip on
both shoulders.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.588
Maybe you're just better
with the old integers
than you are with people.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.465
My first grade teacher,
she told me

07:46.550 --> 07:48.342
that I was born with
two helpings of brain

07:48.426 --> 07:50.261
but only half
a helping of heart.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.056
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

07:55.433 --> 07:58.602
The truth is that
I don't like people much.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.730
And they don't
much like me.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.358
But why, with all your
obvious wit and charm?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.737
Seriously, John.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.032
Mathematics.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.370
Mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.080
And you know why?

08:18.665 --> 08:21.208
Because it's boring.
It's really boring.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.628
You know,
half these schoolboys
are already published?

08:26.756 --> 08:30.217
I cannot waste time
with these classes
and these books.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.182
Memorizing
the weak assumptions of
lesser mortals!

08:39.477 --> 08:43.438
I need to look through
to the governing dynamics.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.445
Find a truly original idea.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.364
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.116
It's the only way
that I'll ever. ..
Matter.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.288
Yes.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.625
All right,
who's next?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.293
I've played enough Go
for one day.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.295
Come on.
I hate this game.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.047
Cowards, all of you!

09:08.131 --> 09:10.216
None of you rise to
meet my challenge?

09:10.300 --> 09:13.886
Come on, Bender.
Whoever wins, Sol does
his laundry all semester.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.430
Does that seem unfair
to anyone else?
Not at all.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.184
Look at him.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.435
Nash!

09:21.519 --> 09:22.978
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.814
I'm hoping to
extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.986
Oh.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.404
Psycho.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.157
Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.450
You ever going to
go to class or. ..

09:37.410 --> 09:39.328
Classes will
dull your mind.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.331
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.625
Oh, I didn't know that.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.169
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.714
Which is another way of
saying he doesn't have
the nerve to compete.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.260
You scared?

09:54.344 --> 09:56.720
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.846
Stupefied by you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.600
No starch.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.018
Pressed and folded.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.565
Let me ask you
something, John.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.359
Be my guest, Martin.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.860
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed

10:11.945 --> 10:14.280
Allen's proof of
Perron's conjecture.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.200
Adequate work
without innovation.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.994
Oh, I'm flattered.
You flattered?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.453
Flattered.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.205
And I've got
two weapons briefs

10:23.290 --> 10:25.624
under security review
by the DoD.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.376
Derivative drivel.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.880
But Nash achievements,
zero.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.342
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual
question coming?

10:36.761 --> 10:40.389
What if you never come up
with your original idea, huh?

10:42.225 --> 10:46.395
How will it feel when
I'm chosen for Wheeler
and you're not?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.234
What if you lose?

11:03.538 --> 11:04.580
You should not have won.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.834
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.544
The hubris of the defeated.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.920
The game is flawed.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.089
Oh!

11:19.137 --> 11:21.513
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.564
You've been
in here for two days.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.569
You know Hansen
has just published
another paper?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.238
I can't even find
a topic for my doctorate.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.494
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.664
This is a group
playing touch football.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.668
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.716
And this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.970
John, you watched a mugging.
That's weird.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.474
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.894
Well,
my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.730
See, if I could
derive an equilibrium

12:12.482 --> 12:16.860
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,
where nobody loses.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.948
Can you imagine the effect
that that would have
on conflict scenarios. ..

12:21.032 --> 12:24.451
When did you last eat?

12:24.536 --> 12:25.577
Currency exchange?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.162
You know, food.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.625
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie,
you know that?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.044
Yes. But pizza. ..

12:35.839 --> 12:38.465
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.593
And, of course, beer.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.351
I have respect for beer.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.397
I have respect for beer!

13:01.698 --> 13:03.907
Good evening,
Neils. Ladies.
Hey, Nash.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.826
Who's winning? You or you?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.786
Good evening, Nash.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.329
Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.000
He's looking
at you for sure.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.668
Me?

13:14.752 --> 13:15.752
Nash.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.300
Hey, Nash.
Neils is trying to
get your attention.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.635
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.560
Go with God.
Come back a man.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.563
Fortune favors the brave.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.898
Bombs away.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.653
Gentlemen,
might I remind you
that my odds of success

13:41.738 --> 13:43.739
dramatically improve
with each attempt?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.167
This is going
to be classic.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.449
Maybe you want to
buy me a drink.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.165
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

14:35.250 --> 14:37.834
in order for you to
have intercourse with me,

14:37.961 --> 14:40.003
but could we assume
that I've said all that?

14:40.964 --> 14:43.882
Essentially,
we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.968
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.179
That was sweet.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.641
Have a nice night, asshole!

14:52.725 --> 14:54.476
Ladies, wait!

14:56.729 --> 15:02.317
I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange.
It was really charming.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.492
Walk with me, John.
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.581
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.083
We're deciding which
placement applications
to support.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.085
Wheeler, sir.
That would be
my first choice.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.753
And, actually,
I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.923
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.009
They've written papers.
They've published.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.470
Oh, I'm still searching,
sir, for my. ..
Your original idea.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.930
Governing dynamics, sir.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.473
It's very clever,
John, but I'm afraid

15:33.558 --> 15:35.017
it's just not
nearly good enough.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.650
May I?
Thank you.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.320
I've been working on
manifold embedding.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.572
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to
show some promise.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.282
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

15:50.366 --> 15:52.367
if you would be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.952
I've repeatedly
asked you for that, sir.
Now, John. ..

15:54.037 --> 15:56.455
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his. ..

15:56.539 --> 15:57.623
John.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.710
Do you see what
they're doing in there?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.549
Congratulations, Professor.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.676
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.055
It's the pens.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.725
Reserved for a member of
the department that makes
the achievement of a lifetime.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.394
Now what do you see, John?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.064
Recognition.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.108
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.902
Well,
try seeing accomplishment.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.321
Is there a difference?

16:29.405 --> 16:32.574
John, you haven't focused.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.704
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

16:37.789 --> 16:40.165
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.253
Good day.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.141
And my compliments
to you, sir.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.351
Thank you so much.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.619
I can't see it.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.505
Jesus Christ, John.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.716
I can't fail.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.008
This is all I am.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.552
Come on, let's go out.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.970
I have to get
something done.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.347
I can't keep
staring into space.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.598
John, that's enough!

17:38.683 --> 17:40.308
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,

17:40.393 --> 17:41.643
read their books,
do their classes.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.396
You wanna do some damage,
that's fine,
but don't mess around.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.150
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.194
John, do it.
Don't mess around.

17:51.279 --> 17:55.073
Bust your head!
Go on, bust that
worthless head wide open.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.160
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is
your problem?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.748
It's not my problem.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.668
And it's not your problem.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.423
It's their problem.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.968
Your answer isn't,
"Face the wall."

18:15.887 --> 18:18.930
It's out there,
where you've been working.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.704
That was heavy.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.502
That Isaac Newton
fellow was right.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.171
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.466
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it
in a minute.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.635
Oh, God!

19:00.890 --> 19:02.766
Incoming, gentlemen.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.564
Deep breaths.

19:10.358 --> 19:14.319
Nash, you might want
to stop shuffling your
papers for five seconds.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.492
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.410
We're not here
for beer, my friend.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.039
Oh.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.168
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving
in slow motion?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.338
Will she want
a large wedding,
you think?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.841
Shall we say swords?
Pistols at dawn?

19:35.925 --> 19:38.343
Have you remembered nothing?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.262
Recall
the lessons of Adam Smith,

19:40.388 --> 19:42.222
the father of
modern economics.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.852
"In competition,
individual ambition
serves the common good."

19:46.936 --> 19:48.019
Exactly!

19:48.104 --> 19:49.312
Every man for himself,
gentlemen.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.274
Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.817
I'm not
going to strike out.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.444
You can lead
a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.572
All right, nobody move.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.157
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.160
Oh, God.
All right, he may have
the upper hand now,

20:04.245 --> 20:05.537
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.706
Remember the last time?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.834
Oh, yes.
That was one
for the history books.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.341
Adam Smith needs revision.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.010
What are you
talking about?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.054
If we all go
for the blonde,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.519
we block each other.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.148
Not a single one of us
is going to get her.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.442
So then we go
for her friends,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.237
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder

20:39.322 --> 20:41.197
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.076
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

20:46.829 --> 20:48.955
We don't get in
each other's way

20:49.040 --> 20:51.166
and we don't insult
the other girls.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.502
That's the only way we win.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.673
That's the only way
we all get laid.

21:04.847 --> 21:08.516
Adam Smith said,
"The best result comes

21:09.644 --> 21:11.561
"from everyone in the group
doing what's best
for himself."

21:11.646 --> 21:15.690
Right? That's what
he said. That's right.
Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?

21:16.317 --> 21:21.363
Because the best result
will come from everyone
in the group

21:22.281 --> 21:25.784
doing what's best for
himself and the group.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.494
Nash, if this is
some way for you to get

21:27.578 --> 21:29.454
the blonde on your own,
you can go to hell.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.957
Governing dynamics, gentlemen.
Governing dynamics.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.793
Adam Smith was wrong.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.046
Here we go.
Careful, careful.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.801
Thank you.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.649
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

23:00.504 --> 23:01.921
You do realize
this flies in the face

23:02.006 --> 23:03.965
of 1 50 years of
economic theory?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.216
Yes, I do, sir.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.676
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

23:06.761 --> 23:07.886
It is, sir.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.773
Well, Mr. Nash,
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,

23:20.983 --> 23:23.485
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

23:30.826 --> 23:35.830
Wheeler Labs,
they'll ask you to
recommend two team members.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.003
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.838
Sol and Bender, sir.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.175
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.135
Has it occurred to you,
Mr. Nash,

23:49.220 --> 23:51.096
that Sol and Bender might
have plans of their own?

23:56.894 --> 23:58.019
We made it!

23:58.104 --> 24:00.063
Wheeler, we made it!

24:00.689 --> 24:02.524
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

24:02.775 --> 24:04.025
Oh ! Oh!

24:04.902 --> 24:07.112
Okay,
awkward moment, gentlemen.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.596
Governing dynamics.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.184
Congratulations, John.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.727
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

24:39.854 --> 24:41.271
To Wheeler!

25:06.255 --> 25:08.965
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.758
Dr. Nash, your coat?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.385
Thank you, sir.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.053
Doctor.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.431
General, this is
Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.808
Glad you could come, Doctor.

25:18.893 --> 25:19.893
Hello.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.519
Right this way.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.690
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions
from Moscow.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.944
The computer can't
detect a pattern,
but I'm sure it's code.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.405
Why is that, General?

25:33.282 --> 25:35.241
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

25:38.162 --> 25:39.412
Constantly.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.000
We've developed
several ciphers.

25:46.003 --> 25:48.213
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?

25:50.466 --> 25:51.507
Doctor?

25:51.592 --> 25:55.595
6-7-3-7. 0-3-6...

25:55.679 --> 25:57.263
8-4-9-4.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.474
9-1-4-0-3-4.

26:41.684 --> 26:42.725
0-3-4.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.786
I need a map.

27:04.498 --> 27:08.543
46-1 3-08, 67-46-90.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.505
Starkey Corners, Maine.

27:13.966 --> 27:18.720
48-03-01 . 91 -26-35.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.973
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.142
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.311
There are at least
10 others.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.314
They appear to be
routing orders across
the border into the US.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.608
Extraordinary.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.321
Gentlemen,
we need to move on this.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.241
Who's Big Brother?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.744
You've done your country
a great service, son.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.038
Captain!
Yes, sir.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.333
Accompany Dr. Nash.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.209
What are the Russians
moving, General?

27:52.171 --> 27:55.381
Captain Rogers
will escort you to the
unrestricted area, Doctor.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.799
Thank you.

27:57.468 --> 27:58.968
Dr. Nash,
follow me, please.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.729
None of
those who have said
they don't like the method

28:09.813 --> 28:13.191
have told us any other
method they could use
that would be effective.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.444
- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.669
Thank you, sir.
Home run at
the Pentagon, huh?

28:33.754 --> 28:36.631
Have they actually taken
the word "classified"
out of the dictionary?

28:37.508 --> 28:40.093
Hi. The air conditioning
broke again.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.720
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world
if I'm melting?

28:42.805 --> 28:44.597
Our hearts go
out to you, John.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.393
You know,
two trips to the Pentagon
in four years.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.727
That's two more
than we've had.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.104
It gets better, John.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.147
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.900
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

28:55.984 --> 28:58.486
the Nazis are
repatriating South America,

28:58.570 --> 29:00.988
the Chinese have
a standing army
of 2.8 million,

29:01.698 --> 29:04.450
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.620
Look, you made the cover
of Fortune again.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.831
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

29:11.542 --> 29:13.042
That was supposed
to be just me.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.756
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

29:18.841 --> 29:22.135
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine
with these hacks,

29:22.219 --> 29:23.594
these scholars of trivia.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.346
John, exactly what
is the difference

29:25.431 --> 29:27.056
between genius
and most genius?

29:28.892 --> 29:30.059
Quite a lot.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.811
He's your son.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.187
Anyway,
you've got 1 0 minutes.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.565
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

29:35.649 --> 29:36.858
Before your new class?

29:43.532 --> 29:45.408
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

29:46.743 --> 29:49.036
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.623
Come on. You know the drill,
we get these
beautiful facilities. ..

29:52.708 --> 29:54.625
MIT gets America's
great minds of today

29:54.710 --> 29:56.419
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.920
Poor bastards.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.922
Now, have a nice day
at school.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.215
The bell is ringing.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.865
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.836
Can we leave
one open, Professor?
It's really hot, sir.

30:41.131 --> 30:45.593
Your comfort comes
second to my ability
to hear my own voice.

30:50.599 --> 30:55.937
Personally,
I think this class will be
a waste of your,

30:56.271 --> 30:58.606
and what is
infinitely worse,

30:59.983 --> 31:01.609
my time.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.322
However, here we are.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.408
So, you may attend or not.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.286
You may complete
your assignments
at your whim.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.288
We have begun.

31:17.251 --> 31:18.334
Miss.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.880
Excuse me!

31:23.882 --> 31:25.758
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

31:26.301 --> 31:27.301
Hi!

31:29.429 --> 31:31.013
We have a little problem.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.599
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

31:33.684 --> 31:36.394
and extremely noisy
with them open.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.771
So I was wondering
if there was
any way you could,

31:38.855 --> 31:42.483
I don't know,
maybe work someplace else
for about 45 minutes?

31:42.568 --> 31:43.693
Not a problem.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.444
Thank you so much!

31:45.529 --> 31:47.113
- Break!
- Got it!

31:47.698 --> 31:50.241
Let's go.
Clean it up a little bit.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.288
As you will find in
multivariable calculus,
there is often

31:56.790 --> 31:59.083
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.214
As I was saying,
this problem here

32:06.592 --> 32:08.884
will take some of you
many months to solve.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.762
For others among you,

32:13.015 --> 32:15.808
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.074
Professor Nash.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.505
William Parcher.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.382
Big Brother,

32:50.427 --> 32:51.886
at your service.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.181
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

32:55.265 --> 32:56.557
Are you here to
give me a raise?

32:56.683 --> 32:58.351
Let's take a walk.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.228
Impressive work
at the Pentagon.

33:01.355 --> 33:02.855
Yes, it was.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.692
Oppenheimer used to say,
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

33:06.777 --> 33:08.694
You knew Oppenheimer?

33:08.779 --> 33:11.656
His project was
under my supervision.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.240
Which project?

33:16.286 --> 33:17.328
That project.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.913
It's not that simple,
you know?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.623
Well, you ended the war.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.251
We incinerated 1 50,000
people in a heartbeat.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.213
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.800
Conviction, it turns out,

33:30.884 --> 33:34.345
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.224
I'll try and
keep that in mind.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.270
So, John, no family,

33:43.980 --> 33:46.107
no close friends.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.441
Why is that?

33:47.526 --> 33:50.111
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.115
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.701
Well, there are
certain endeavors

33:56.785 --> 33:58.202
where your lack of
personal connection

33:58.286 --> 34:00.538
would be considered
an advantage.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.250
This is a secure area.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.168
They know me.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.255
Have you ever been here?

34:10.340 --> 34:11.966
We were told during
our initial briefing

34:12.050 --> 34:14.051
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.344
That's not
precisely accurate.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.259
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

34:55.342 --> 34:58.929
I am increasing
your security clearance
to top secret.

34:59.014 --> 35:03.058
Disclosure of
secure information can
result in imprisonment.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.185
Get it?

35:05.061 --> 35:06.312
What operation?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.986
Those are a good idea.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.368
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it at
the end of the war.

35:21.703 --> 35:25.790
Nazi engineers were
attempting to build
a portable atomic bomb.

35:25.916 --> 35:28.042
The Soviets
reached this facility
before we did,

35:28.126 --> 35:29.460
and we lost the damn thing.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.715
The routing orders
at the Pentagon.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.926
They were about this,
weren't they?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.888
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.558
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda,

35:44.643 --> 35:46.685
the "New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

35:46.770 --> 35:49.688
and intends to
detonate it on U.S. soil.

35:50.524 --> 35:53.067
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.909
Man is capable of
as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.081
New Freedom
has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.419
McCarthy is an idiot,
but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.257
New Freedom
communicates to its agents

36:16.341 --> 36:19.426
through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

36:19.511 --> 36:20.594
and that's where
you come in.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.807
You see, John,
what distinguishes you

36:25.642 --> 36:28.352
is that you are,
quite simply,

36:28.937 --> 36:32.690
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.490
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

36:46.580 --> 36:49.415
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

36:50.959 --> 36:55.671
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,
decipher them.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.384
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.844
Stare into the light.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.929
Pulse 88, regular.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.310
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.940
It's got a little zap
to it, doesn't it?

37:15.025 --> 37:17.860
He just implanted
a radium diode.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.612
Don't worry, it's safe.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.573
The isotope
decays predictably.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.576
As a result,
these numbers change
over time.

37:26.161 --> 37:29.121
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.834
So what am I now, a spy?

37:46.848 --> 37:47.973
Come.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.688
Boy, you must be
really important.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.823
It's all right, Mike.

38:14.376 --> 38:15.542
What are you working on?

38:18.213 --> 38:19.546
Classified.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.549
Everyone waited
half an hour.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.051
For?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.387
Class.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.847
You missed class today.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.684
Well, I suspect that

38:33.812 --> 38:35.562
nobody missed me.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.565
The problem that you
left on the board. ..

38:40.235 --> 38:41.360
I solved it.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.071
No, you didn't.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.531
You didn't even look.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.618
I never said that
the vector fields
were rational functions.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.208
Your solution is elegant.

38:58.712 --> 39:01.296
Though on this
particular occasion

39:02.424 --> 39:04.174
ultimately incorrect.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.114
You're still here.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.949
I'm still here.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.410
Why?

39:32.287 --> 39:35.372
I'm wondering,
Professor Nash,

39:36.791 --> 39:38.625
if I can ask you
to dinner.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.840
You do eat, don't you?

39:45.300 --> 39:46.967
On occasion, yeah.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.095
Table for one.
Prometheus alone,
chained to the rock

39:50.180 --> 39:52.473
with the bird
circling overhead,
you know how it is.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.145
No, I expect that
you wouldn't know.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.401
Leave your address
with my office.

40:04.486 --> 40:09.364
I'll pick you up Friday
at 8:00 and we'll eat.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.084
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

40:20.168 --> 40:22.211
or should I just
keep calling you "miss"?

40:25.715 --> 40:27.382
Governor,
may I present. ..

40:27.467 --> 40:29.510
Miss Alicia Larde.
Miss Alicia Larde.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.180
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.059
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

40:38.812 --> 40:42.523
I want a copy of this.
First big date
and all, you know.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.609
So, you boys
need to look good,

40:46.861 --> 40:51.532
which is not a state
you find yourselves in
altogether naturally.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.371
There. Better.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.957
I'm surprising him.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.960
You just keep on
surprising him. Professor.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.729
God must be a painter.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.066
Why else would we
have so many colors?

41:28.653 --> 41:30.404
So you're a painter?

41:31.573 --> 41:33.991
That's not actually
what I said,

41:34.826 --> 41:38.370
but, yes, I am.

41:47.797 --> 41:48.922
Here.

41:50.383 --> 41:52.926
Me. Your date.

41:55.555 --> 41:58.140
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.726
That's a plan.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.647
Champagne would be lovely.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.443
I'll be outside.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.029
I will get the champagne.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.122
Oh, thank you.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.000
Thank you for that.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.169
No, keep it.

42:27.253 --> 42:30.005
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.174
Do you?

42:32.842 --> 42:33.967
No.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.637
I don't believe in luck.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.560
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

42:44.729 --> 42:45.979
Oh.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.573
I once tried to
count them all.

42:57.825 --> 43:01.954
I actually made it
to 4,348.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.832
You are exceptionally odd.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.336
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.219
A pair of odd ducks, then.

43:18.346 --> 43:19.471
Mmm.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.351
Pick a shape.

43:26.437 --> 43:27.521
What?

43:28.648 --> 43:31.358
Pick a shape,
an animal, anything.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.987
Okay.

43:36.197 --> 43:37.614
An umbrella.

44:15.611 --> 44:19.239
Do it again.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.283
All right.
What would you like?

44:21.409 --> 44:23.285
Do an octopus.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.500
You don't talk much,
do you?

47:16.584 --> 47:19.419
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.838
I don't mean work.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.637
I find that
polishing my interactions

47:28.721 --> 47:32.432
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

47:33.768 --> 47:37.062
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow

47:38.814 --> 47:40.565
by being direct.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.402
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

47:44.612 --> 47:45.820
Try me.

47:47.615 --> 47:48.698
All right.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.163
I find you attractive.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.832
Your aggressive
moves towards me

47:57.917 --> 47:59.960
indicate that you
feel the same way.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.171
But still,
ritual requires that

48:03.256 --> 48:05.465
we continue with a number
of platonic activities

48:05.925 --> 48:08.009
before we have sex.

48:08.636 --> 48:11.388
I am proceeding
with those activities,

48:11.472 --> 48:13.473
but in point of
actual fact,

48:13.641 --> 48:18.103
all I really want to do is
have intercourse with you
as soon as possible.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.107
Are you going to
slap me now?

48:46.799 --> 48:48.508
How was that result?

49:05.818 --> 49:07.527
What are you doing?

49:12.033 --> 49:14.034
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences

49:14.118 --> 49:17.329
within periodicals
over time. And you?

49:17.455 --> 49:19.581
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.837
Do I know you?

49:25.921 --> 49:28.173
My uncle says
you're very smart

49:28.257 --> 49:29.716
but not very nice,

49:29.800 --> 49:32.135
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.095
And who might
your uncle be?

49:34.180 --> 49:35.513
The prodigal roommate

49:36.974 --> 49:38.475
returns.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.648
Come here!
Charles, Charles.

49:50.363 --> 49:54.074
My sister got herself
killed in a car crash.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.327
Not too far now, Marcee!

49:57.995 --> 50:00.246
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk

50:00.373 --> 50:02.624
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.751
So, I took her in.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.587
She's so small.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.674
Well, she's young, John.
That's how they come.

50:12.426 --> 50:17.097
I'm at Harvard
doing the great
author's workshop.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.973
D. H. bloody Lawrence.

50:19.266 --> 50:21.184
I really do think
you should buy
yourself a new book.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.981
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.693
How are you, John?

50:30.486 --> 50:32.487
At first, all my work
here was trivial,

50:32.571 --> 50:35.281
but a new assignment
came up and. ..

50:36.784 --> 50:38.702
I can't really
tell you any details.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.496
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

50:41.580 --> 50:43.331
Something like that.

50:43.666 --> 50:44.999
And. ..

50:45.126 --> 50:46.459
Yes?

50:47.628 --> 50:49.295
Well, I met a girl.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.715
No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

50:51.799 --> 50:54.175
A biped?
Yep. And contrary
to all probabilities,

50:54.260 --> 50:57.887
she finds me attractive
on a number of
different levels.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.973
God, that's wonderful.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.560
Well, there's no
accounting for taste,
is there?

51:06.647 --> 51:07.939
Should I marry her?

51:08.065 --> 51:09.399
God. Right.

51:11.402 --> 51:12.819
I mean,
everything's going well.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.196
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

51:15.281 --> 51:17.157
It all seems to add up.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.076
But how do you know
for sure?

51:22.371 --> 51:24.622
Nothing's ever
for sure, John.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.625
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.342
Good evening.

51:43.017 --> 51:46.853
Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track
of time at work,

51:48.481 --> 51:49.731
again.
Mmm-hmm.

51:51.525 --> 51:52.859
I'm sorry.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.653
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

51:56.697 --> 51:58.198
Happy birthday.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.496
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

52:04.580 --> 52:06.414
they create a full
wavelength dispersal,

52:06.707 --> 52:07.957
so if you look inside it,
you can see. ..

52:08.042 --> 52:09.083
Every
possible color.

52:09.168 --> 52:12.629
Every possible color.
Yeah.

52:12.713 --> 52:16.633
Remember you said that time,
"God must be a painter
because of all the colors"?

52:16.717 --> 52:18.927
At the governor's house,
you said that.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.222
I didn't think
you were listening.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.726
I was listening.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.068
It's beautiful.

52:51.627 --> 52:54.379
Alicia, does our
relationship warrant
long-term commitment?

52:54.463 --> 52:56.214
Because I need
some kind of proof,

52:56.298 --> 52:59.092
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

53:04.849 --> 53:07.350
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment

53:08.936 --> 53:12.105
to redefine my
girlish notions of romance.

53:15.734 --> 53:16.943
A proof?

53:17.611 --> 53:19.237
Verifiable data.

53:20.948 --> 53:22.031
Okay.

53:23.951 --> 53:27.203
Well, how big
is the universe?

53:27.872 --> 53:29.122
Infinite.

53:29.415 --> 53:30.915
How do you know?

53:31.000 --> 53:32.500
I know because
all the data indicates
it's infinite.

53:32.585 --> 53:33.877
But it hasn't
been proven yet?
No.

53:33.961 --> 53:34.961
You haven't seen it.
No.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.212
How do you know for sure?

53:37.631 --> 53:39.132
I don't,
I just believe it.

53:39.258 --> 53:40.425
Mmm.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.637
It's the same with love,
I guess.

53:52.521 --> 53:56.065
Now, the part that
you don't know

53:58.402 --> 54:00.945
is if I want to
marry you.

54:21.967 --> 54:23.760
Smile for the camera!

54:27.556 --> 54:28.890
Well done!

54:31.018 --> 54:32.518
Congratulations.

54:34.855 --> 54:36.564
You look beautiful.

54:37.816 --> 54:39.108
Hi,
how are you?

54:46.033 --> 54:47.951
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, now.

54:48.202 --> 54:50.453
- Bye!
- Bye!

54:50.537 --> 54:51.913
Be safe!

55:21.318 --> 55:22.819
Get in. Hurry.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.533
They're following us.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.414
Who is. ..
Who is following us?

55:34.623 --> 55:36.082
The drop has been
compromised.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.251
Get down!

55:39.086 --> 55:40.294
Stay down.

56:08.699 --> 56:09.741
Here, take this.

56:09.867 --> 56:10.908
I ain't shooting anybody.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.410
Take the goddamn gun!

56:12.536 --> 56:13.953
No!

56:32.473 --> 56:34.182
You stay back.
Don't move.

57:21.605 --> 57:22.688
John?

57:29.988 --> 57:31.155
Hi.

57:34.034 --> 57:35.368
Where were you?

57:38.664 --> 57:41.374
Sol. ..
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.085
He said you left
the office hours ago.

57:47.047 --> 57:48.923
Why didn't you call me?

57:53.762 --> 57:55.096
Are you all right?

58:04.523 --> 58:06.107
Honey?

58:07.901 --> 58:09.068
John.

58:09.736 --> 58:12.405
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.616
John, open the door.

58:17.578 --> 58:20.079
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

58:20.622 --> 58:21.998
Talk to me!

58:23.750 --> 58:24.917
John!

58:26.003 --> 58:27.545
Open this door!

58:44.938 --> 58:46.731
Watch for cars, kids.

59:07.628 --> 59:09.378
What was that?

59:28.982 --> 59:30.274
John.

59:31.777 --> 59:32.860
William.

59:33.612 --> 59:36.197
This is not what
I signed up for.

59:36.281 --> 59:38.032
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams. ..

59:38.242 --> 59:41.869
I understand
better than you could
possibly imagine.

59:51.672 --> 59:53.839
You need to
calm down, John.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.093
Now listen to me.
We're closing in
on the bomb,

59:57.177 --> 59:59.262
in large part
due to your work.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:02.014
Now don't you think
your fear is a small price
to pay?

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:05.309
William,
my circumstance has changed.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.353
Alicia's pregnant.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.572
I told you
attachments were dangerous.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.200
You chose to
marry the girl.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.161
I did nothing
to prevent it.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.792
The best way to
ensure everybody's safety

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.877
is for you to
continue your work.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.547
Well, I'll just quit.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:36.382
You won't.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:37.925
Why would I not?

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.012
Because I keep
the Russians from knowing
you work for us.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.889
You quit working for me,

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.559
I quit working for you.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.283
Parcher! Parcher!

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.956
John, you all right?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.228
John?

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.064
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.196
Why would you do that?
Why would you
turn the light on?

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.822
What is wrong with you?

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.991
You have to go
to your sister's.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:45.868
I left the car
at the back.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.995
Now you can
take Commonwealth,
no side streets.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.372
John. ..
Stay where it's crowded.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.332
John,
I'm not going anywhere!

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.250
When you get to
your sister's, you wait
for me to call.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.335
No, I'm not going.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.711
Just get your things.
I'm not leaving!

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.296
Stop! Stop it.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.757
Please, Alicia.

01:02:02.094 --> 01:02:04.053
I'll explain when I can.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:54.103
Uncle John!
Uncle John!

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.275
Hey, baby girl!

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.611
Wow,
someone needed a hug.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.698
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself,

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:09.452
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture by the
inimitable John Nash?"

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:14.832
What's wrong?

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.379
I got myself into something.
I think I might need
some help.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.339
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.383
Professor Nash!

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:26.510
Welcome!

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.763
After?

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.735
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann zeta function

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:48.240
correspond to singularities
in space-time.

01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:51.744
Singularities in
space-time then. ..

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.416
And conventional
number theory. ..

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:03.297
It breaks down
in the face of
relativistic exploration.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:23.651
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:29.865
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.761
Professor Nash!

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:02.773
Hold it!

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:03.941
Professor Nash?

01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:11.574
Professor Nash,
let's avoid a scene,
shall we?

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:13.993
What do you want?

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.579
My name is Rosen.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.747
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.959
Forgive me if I
don't seem persuaded.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.545
I'd like you to
come with me, John.

01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:27.590
Just for a chat.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.759
It appears
I have no choice.

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:43.981
Help me! Somebody!

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.487
Somebody! Help me!

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:52.823
Get off me!

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.117
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.119
- No, no, no, don't!
- Charles!

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.121
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.956
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.541
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:04.251
Get away from me.

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.337
Stay away from me!

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.135
There, now.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.055
All better.

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:21.894
Everything's all right here.

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:25.814
Watch your head.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:57.221
John? John?

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.849
Can you hear me?

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.949
Go easy now.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:20.202
Thorazine takes
a little while to wear off.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.457
Sorry about the restraints.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.085
But you've got one
hell of a right hook.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:31.046
Where am I?

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:35.426
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.097
I find that
highly unlikely.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:42.850
You made a mistake.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:46.854
My work is non-military
in application.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.481
Which work is that,
John?

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.318
I don't know anything.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.488
There's no good
in keeping secrets,
you know.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:17.259
Charles?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.180
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.349
I'm. . . I'm sorry.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:31.023
Charles?

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.698
The prodigal
roommate revealed.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:47.163
"Saw my name on
the lecture slate"?

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.874
You lying son of a bitch!

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.542
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.129
How do you say
"Charles Herman"
in Russian?

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:55.589
How do you say it
in Russian?

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.216
There's
no one there, John.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:00.301
There's no one there.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.055
He's right there.
He's right there.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:08.810
Stop! I don't know anything!
Stop! I don't know anything!

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:14.817
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held
against my will.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.486
Somebody call the
Department of Defense.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.698
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held
against my will!

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.747
What's wrong
with him?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.836
John has schizophrenia.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.173
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.761
But. . . But his work.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.389
He deals with conspiracy.
So. ..

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.725
Yes. Yes, I know.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:54.106
In John's world,
these behaviors are
accepted, encouraged.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.402
As such,
his illness may
have gone untreated

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.737
far longer than is typical.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:02.781
What do you mean?
How long?

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.700
Possibly since
graduate school.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.412
At least that's
when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:10.664
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.458
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.837
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.382
Charles isn't imaginary.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.509
He and John have
been best friends
since Princeton.

01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:26.054
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.891
He's always in town
for so little time,
lecturing.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.142
Was he at your wedding?

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.393
He had to teach.

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.728
Have you seen
a picture of him,

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.062
or talked to him
on the telephone?

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.273
This is ridiculous.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.108
I phoned Princeton.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:42.195
According to
their housing records,
John lived alone.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:48.535
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband,

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.704
a mathematician with
no military training,

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:52.956
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians. ..

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:54.917
You're making him
sound crazy.

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.045
Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:04.092
Now, the only way
I can help him is to
show him the difference

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:07.971
between what is real
and what is in his mind.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.352
Come on.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.522
What's he been
working on?

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:20.359
His work is classified.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:25.656
He mentioned
a supervisor by the name
of William Parcher.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.283
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.203
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:35.874
You want me to help
you get the details
of my husband's work?

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:41.171
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
Is that what you think?

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.220
What did the doctor say?
Is he sick?

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.682
I don't know.
I want to see what
John's been working on.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:53.642
Alicia, you know,
you can't go in his office.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.144
You know, it's classified,
Alicia. Stop.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:17.666
Oh, my God.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.510
Why didn't you
say something?

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:33.557
Alicia, I mean,
John has always
been a little weird.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:38.061
He said he was
doing code-breaking.
That it was eyes-only.

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:41.565
Top-secret, part of
the military effort.
Was he?

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.442
Well,
it was possible,
you know?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.027
I mean, directives
come down all the time

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.653
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:48.155
It was possible.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:50.407
Possible, but not likely.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:57.622
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated,
and then when you called. ..

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.209
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.128
Cutting up magazines?

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:07.007
Well, not all.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.257
I'm so sorry.

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.508
It's okay.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.472
I missed you.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.810
I have to talk to you.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:43.436
Okay.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.319
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:54.531
and I do realize
that my behavior

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:58.368
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:02.706
must have appeared insane.
I left you with
no other choice.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:06.251
I do understand,
and I'm truly sorry.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.295
That's okay.

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:15.427
Everything is
gonna be all right.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:18.430
We just have to
talk quietly.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:23.393
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.479
I'm gonna tell
you everything now.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:30.442
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:34.738
because you have to
help me get out of here.

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.576
Alicia, I've been
doing top-secret work
for the government.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.538
There's a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.876
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.836
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:53.131
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me
from doing my work.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:54.925
You have to get to Wheeler.
Stop.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.259
You have to find
William Parcher.
Stop.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.969
He could help us.
He could help us.
Stop. Stop.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.721
He could help us. ..
Stop!

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.311
I went to Wheeler.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.063
Good, good.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.148
There is no William Parcher.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.526
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.279
Doing what?
Breaking codes?

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:21.576
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox for the
government to pick up?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.329
How could you know that?

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.289
Sol followed you.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.001
He thought
it was harmless.
Sol followed me?

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:41.680
They've never been opened.

01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:46.184
It isn't real.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:50.313
There is no conspiracy, John.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.235
There is no William Parcher.

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:58.363
It's in your mind.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.827
Do you understand, baby?

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.038
You're sick.

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:11.876
You're sick, John.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.714
John?

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:28.810
Code red.
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation Room 2.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:32.314
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation Room 2.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:48.705
John?

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.043
The implant is gone.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.004
I can't find it.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:01.718
It's gone.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:36.127
You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.922
is not knowing what's true.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.967
Imagine if you had
suddenly learned that

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:47.847
the people and the places
and the moments
most important to you

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:50.683
were not gone, not dead,

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:54.270
but worse, had never been.

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.151
What kind of hell
would that be?

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:07.409
Administering insulin.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.412
8:42 a.m.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:10.346
How often?

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:15.185
Five times a week
for 1 0 weeks.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:41.586
John always
spoke so fondly of
being here at Princeton.

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.297
And Hansen is running
the department now.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.425
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:49.511
Yeah.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:53.515
John won't come near
the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.060
Hey, hey.

01:20:58.145 --> 01:20:59.479
Want this?

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.399
So, Alicia,
how are you holding up?

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:07.111
Well,
delusions have passed.

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:10.031
They're saying
with the medication and
low stress environment. ..

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:11.324
No. ..

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:13.910
I mean, how are you?

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:23.670
I think often what I feel

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.089
is obligation.

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.469
Or guilt over
wanting to leave.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:37.475
Rage against John,
against God, and. ..

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.020
But. ..

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:46.401
Then I look at him,

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:51.489
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.742
And he becomes that man.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:58.871
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.545
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.717
It's not
all the time, but

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:14.470
it's enough.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:19.017
I think John is
a very lucky man, Alicia.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:25.773
So unlucky.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.279
This is us.
This is it?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.530
It's nice.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:33.698
It's near
where I work.

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.242
John? You have a visitor.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:43.124
Hi.

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.376
I hope it's okay.

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:54.344
Hey, chief.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.222
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.974
I quit, actually.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.064
Hello.
Hey, John.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.526
Have you met Harvey?

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.323
John, there's no. ..
Relax, it's okay.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.909
There's no point in
being nuts if you can't
have a little fun.

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:21.037
Jesus Christ, John.
You know, I should have known.

01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:24.123
Here you go.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.503
I can take those later.

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.129
You're supposed
to take them now.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:32.882
Can I bring you something?

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:34.592
I'm okay.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:36.094
Okay.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.768
So, yeah, I was in
town giving a workshop.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.603
I go back tonight.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:50.024
You know, Bender,
he really wanted to stop by

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.860
and, you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.153
Squeamish?

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:57.407
Yeah.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:59.701
I suppose I would be, too.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.120
But, alas,
I'm stuck with me.

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:07.875
I'm trying to solve
the Riemann hypothesis.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960
Uh-huh.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.546
Yeah?

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:15.383
I figured if I dazzle them

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:18.010
they will have
to reinstate me.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:22.473
But it's difficult
with the medication

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:26.185
because it's hard to

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:30.440
see the solution.

01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:41.242
You know, John,
you should go easy.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:45.163
There are other things
besides work.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.001
What are they?

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:28.247
What are you thinking about?

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.252
What do people do?

01:25:33.504 --> 01:25:35.087
It's life, John.

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:37.590
Activities available.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.259
Just add meaning.

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.186
You could try
leaving the house.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:54.816
You know,
maybe talk to people.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:03.241
You could try
taking out the garbage.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:28.266
And there's some more. ..
There's some more in. ..

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.655
Who. ..
Who were you talking to?

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:44.824
Garbage man.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:56.294
Garbage men
don't come at night.

01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:01.465
I guess around here
they do.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:28.993
Sorry.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.603
Is it the medication?

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:20.771
I don't know what to do.

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:41.751
My mother's going
to keep the baby
a little longer tonight.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:45.463
I can get three
hours of overtime.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.032
I'm going to bed.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.374
Good night.

01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:43.622
It's good to
see you, John.

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:46.500
It's been a while.

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:48.752
Parcher?

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:51.005
Yes, sir.

01:31:54.593 --> 01:31:55.843
You're not real!

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:58.596
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

01:32:03.226 --> 01:32:05.686
I don't think that
I would go that way, John.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.481
It's time for you
to get back to work.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:13.611
The bomb is in
its final position
here in the U.S.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.156
Knowing your
situation requires

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.075
you keep a low profile,
Mohammed,

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:23.495
we've brought
the mountain to you.

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:44.266
We've narrowed
the bomb's location

01:32:44.351 --> 01:32:47.228
to somewhere on
the eastern seaboard,

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.065
but we haven't been able to
pinpoint its exact position.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:57.238
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:01.492
Look at this, John.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.956
What? What?

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.751
Dr. Rosen said. ..

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:13.504
Rosen ! That quack!

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:16.840
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?
Psychological bullshit!

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.677
Look at me, John.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:22.012
John, look at me.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.808
Do I look like
I'm imagined?

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.229
Wheeler has
no record of you.

01:33:30.355 --> 01:33:32.773
Do you think we
list our personnel?

01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:37.945
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:41.573
I've gone to
a great deal of trouble
to get you back.

01:33:41.992 --> 01:33:44.618
I can restore your
status at Wheeler.

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:47.454
I can let the world
know what you did.

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:49.707
But I need you now,
soldier.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:58.465
I was so scared
you weren't real.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.309
There's a storm coming.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:11.145
I'm just going to
grab the laundry. Okay?

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:12.938
I'll draw his bath.

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:17.735
It's okay.

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:20.946
Okay.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.671
John!

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:10.472
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just
watch the baby.

01:36:11.558 --> 01:36:12.599
No!

01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:15.060
Oh, God.

01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:26.280
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:27.614
There is no one here.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:29.116
Oh, my God!

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.868
Charles was watching him.
There is no one here!

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:32.870
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:34.788
I can see him
because of a chemical

01:36:34.873 --> 01:36:36.623
that was released
into my bloodstream

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:38.250
when my implant dissolved.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.588
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your
own protection!

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.049
Alicia!

01:36:51.181 --> 01:36:52.222
No!

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:54.308
Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:55.726
You've got to
stop her, John.

01:36:58.271 --> 01:36:59.938
You leave her out of it.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.233
Who are you talking to?

01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:05.152
It's not her fault.
John.

01:37:05.236 --> 01:37:07.488
She'll compromise us again.
No, she won't.

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:08.655
You'll go back
to the hospital.

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.032
John, answer me!

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:11.366
Countless people will die.

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:13.243
Alicia, please put
the phone down.

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:14.411
I can't let that happen.

01:37:14.496 --> 01:37:17.581
Yes, hello?
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen.
Is he in?

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:20.751
I'm sorry, John.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:23.212
No!

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:27.841
Alicia.

01:37:27.926 --> 01:37:29.009
You know what you
have to do, Nash.

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:30.135
Get away from me.

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.179
She's too great a risk.
Get away!

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:35.098
I didn't mean
to hurt you!

01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:39.603
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

01:37:43.942 --> 01:37:45.484
Uncle John?

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:49.029
You take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,
or I'll take care of you.

01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:53.200
John. Christ,
John, please do
what he says.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:55.494
Move, soldier.

01:37:55.954 --> 01:37:56.995
Now.

01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.580
Uncle John?

01:37:59.499 --> 01:38:01.041
John, please!

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.502
Now!

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:06.755
Alicia and Charles
never coexist in the
same interactive field.

01:38:06.839 --> 01:38:09.258
Parcher and Charles...

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:15.138
Charles and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.310
With Alicia.

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:22.104
I understand.

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.235
No!

01:38:38.871 --> 01:38:40.122
She never gets old.

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:46.587
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:21.246
You see them now?

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:32.049
Yes.

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:35.927
Why did you
stop your meds?

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:40.599
Because I couldn't
do my work.

01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:44.269
I couldn't help with
the baby. I couldn't. ..

01:39:47.023 --> 01:39:48.315
I couldn't
respond to my wife.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:53.654
You think that's better
than being crazy?

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.657
We'll need to start
you on a higher run

01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:58.700
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

01:39:58.785 --> 01:39:59.826
No.

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.663
There has to be
another way.

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:04.414
Schizophrenia
is degenerative.

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:08.794
Some days may be
symptom-free, but over time,
you are getting worse.

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.463
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:14.466
It's a problem
with no solution.

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:16.343
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:18.220
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

01:40:18.304 --> 01:40:19.638
You can't come up
with a formula to

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:21.348
change the way
you experience the world.

01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:23.058
All I have to do
is apply my mind.

01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:24.851
There's no theorem,
no proof.

01:40:24.936 --> 01:40:26.186
You can't reason
your way out of this.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:27.354
Why not? Why can't I?

01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:30.607
Because your mind
is where the problem
is in the first place.

01:40:32.735 --> 01:40:34.236
I can do this.

01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:38.490
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:43.537
Is that the baby?

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:47.666
The baby is at
my mother's, John.

01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:08.520
Without treatment, John,
the fantasies may
take over entirely.

01:41:27.331 --> 01:41:28.623
You almost ready?

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:33.086
Rosen's waiting outside.

01:41:34.839 --> 01:41:36.590
I can't go back
to that hospital.

01:41:40.845 --> 01:41:42.095
I won't come home.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:51.938
He said that if you said that
he has commitment papers
for me to sign.

01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:57.110
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

01:41:58.696 --> 01:42:00.447
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

01:42:03.993 --> 01:42:05.702
I will try to
figure this out.

01:42:08.206 --> 01:42:12.584
Whatever you do,
Rosen is right
about one thing.

01:42:14.212 --> 01:42:15.545
You shouldn't be here.

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:19.633
I'm not safe anymore.

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:27.724
Would you have
hurt me, John?

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:38.944
I don't know.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:42.572
Maybe you should
let Dr. Rosen drive you
to your mother's.

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:05.470
He told me to leave.

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:14.271
I understand.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:52.893
Rosen said to call if
you try and kill me,
or anything.

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:12.203
You want to know
what's real?

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:35.185
This.

01:44:37.647 --> 01:44:39.105
This is real.

01:44:42.693 --> 01:44:46.905
Maybe the part
that knows the waking
from the dream,

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:50.200
maybe it isn't here.

01:44:54.497 --> 01:44:55.872
Maybe it's here.

01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:07.217
I need to believe
that something
extraordinary is possible.

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:11.698
Come.

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:22.083
Hello, Martin.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:29.257
Jesus Christ.

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:32.427
No, I. ..

01:46:34.055 --> 01:46:37.682
I don't have that one.
My savior complex takes on
a completely different form.

01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:42.937
I heard what happened
and I wanted to write,

01:46:43.022 --> 01:46:44.230
and I tried you
at MacArthur's,

01:46:44.315 --> 01:46:45.857
but you'd left,
and I just. ..

01:46:59.288 --> 01:47:00.705
This is
Helinger's old office.

01:47:01.457 --> 01:47:02.540
Yeah.

01:47:02.958 --> 01:47:04.793
Yeah, I stole it from him.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:10.090
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

01:47:12.093 --> 01:47:14.052
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

01:47:15.012 --> 01:47:16.805
Please, please,
have a seat.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:19.724
God, it's so good
to see you.

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.771
What brings you
back to Princeton?

01:47:25.314 --> 01:47:29.400
John? John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:31.778
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:34.614
Tell him your work is
critical. John, please!

01:47:49.755 --> 01:47:52.507
Is there any chance
that you could ignore
what I just did?

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:56.386
Of course.
What are old friends for?

01:47:58.848 --> 01:48:01.391
Is that what
we are, Martin? Friends?

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:02.767
John, of course.

01:48:04.061 --> 01:48:06.020
Of course.
We always have been.

01:48:11.527 --> 01:48:16.489
Alicia and I think that
fitting in, being part of
a community,

01:48:20.369 --> 01:48:21.661
might do me some good.

01:48:21.745 --> 01:48:23.329
That a certain
level of attachment,

01:48:23.414 --> 01:48:24.998
familiar places,
familiar people,

01:48:26.917 --> 01:48:30.253
might help me elbow out

01:48:34.884 --> 01:48:36.885
these certain delusions
that I have.

01:48:42.725 --> 01:48:44.726
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:49.189
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

01:48:52.943 --> 01:48:55.195
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

01:49:04.622 --> 01:49:05.747
Huh.

01:49:10.002 --> 01:49:11.461
Will you be
needing an office?

01:49:16.342 --> 01:49:17.383
No.

01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.639
No, I could just
work out of the library.

01:49:23.766 --> 01:49:26.351
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

01:49:26.435 --> 01:49:27.727
but he doesn't have ID.

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:29.062
Why can't people
read their memos, huh?

01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:30.730
Then, he goes
totally nuts.

01:49:31.148 --> 01:49:34.067
You're not real!
You're not real.

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:36.236
There's no mission.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.238
Shit. Shit.

01:49:39.365 --> 01:49:41.741
You're not real!
You are not real!

01:49:41.825 --> 01:49:44.911
Is this what
you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?

01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:46.871
The local madman?

01:49:46.956 --> 01:49:48.164
I'm not a soldier.

01:49:48.332 --> 01:49:49.582
You're gonna
end up in a cell!

01:49:49.667 --> 01:49:51.793
Old, worthless, discarded.

01:49:51.877 --> 01:49:53.002
There's no mission.

01:49:53.087 --> 01:49:56.422
And while you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!

01:49:56.507 --> 01:49:58.883
You are not real!
You are not real!

01:49:58.968 --> 01:50:01.094
You're still
talking to me, soldier.

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:04.264
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:06.307
John ! John!

01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:11.437
Hey, hey, hey.
John, John. It's okay.

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:13.189
I just heard
what happened,
I'm sorry. John.

01:50:13.274 --> 01:50:15.024
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:17.777
Nash, hey,
you're all right.

01:50:20.823 --> 01:50:21.906
Nash.

01:50:26.704 --> 01:50:29.580
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:30.748
John?

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:35.503
You should've
seen their faces.

01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:37.797
Everybody was
just staring at me.

01:50:38.299 --> 01:50:42.927
John, you know
that stress triggers
the delusions.

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:45.013
I know.

01:50:48.225 --> 01:50:51.728
But then, on the way home,
Charles was there.

01:50:57.067 --> 01:50:59.152
Sometimes, I really
miss talking to him.

01:51:03.198 --> 01:51:04.407
Maybe Rosen's right.

01:51:06.243 --> 01:51:08.953
Maybe I have to
think about going back
into the hospital again.

01:51:09.621 --> 01:51:11.789
No. Come here.

01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:18.588
Maybe try again tomorrow.

01:51:43.614 --> 01:51:46.491
John, now you can't
ignore me forever.

01:51:52.331 --> 01:51:56.000
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.
The best.

01:51:58.504 --> 01:51:59.962
But I won't
talk to you again.

01:52:04.134 --> 01:52:05.635
I just can't.

01:52:11.975 --> 01:52:13.559
Same goes for you,
baby girl.

01:52:21.819 --> 01:52:32.120
Good-bye.

01:52:46.802 --> 01:52:48.719
I was wondering if
I might audit your course.

01:52:50.848 --> 01:52:53.307
It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

01:52:56.812 --> 01:52:58.020
Is something wrong?

01:53:00.357 --> 01:53:01.607
This will be
my first class.

01:53:06.029 --> 01:53:09.532
Good morning,
eager young minds.

01:53:30.387 --> 01:53:32.096
It's never
going to work, John.

01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:35.183
You're just
humiliating yourself.

01:53:37.853 --> 01:53:41.481
It's pathetic!
You are being pathetic.

01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:43.816
I'm ashamed of you!

01:54:11.595 --> 01:54:12.845
Man!

01:54:17.226 --> 01:54:19.769
Are you coming?
You're going to be late.

01:54:23.023 --> 01:54:24.815
Dad, you've got my book.
What?

01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:27.026
You've got my book.

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:28.444
Right.

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:30.071
Thanks.

01:54:31.615 --> 01:54:32.865
Good-bye.
Bye.

01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:34.116
See you tonight.

01:54:35.494 --> 01:54:36.911
Bye, honey.

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:11.172
Did you just solve Riemann?

01:56:11.256 --> 01:56:12.673
Well, what do you think?

01:56:13.717 --> 01:56:14.759
Huh.

01:56:14.843 --> 01:56:17.803
That's an analog
to Frobenius for
non-commutative extensions.

01:56:20.182 --> 01:56:21.557
Yes, it is.

01:56:22.476 --> 01:56:25.269
But it only appears
to work sporadically,
so, no.

01:56:27.272 --> 01:56:29.231
But I believe
I'm making progress.

01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:35.237
You're John Nash, right?

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:40.368
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

01:56:40.452 --> 01:56:42.078
I've been studying
your equilibrium,

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:43.871
the one you wrote
here at Princeton.

01:56:43.955 --> 01:56:46.457
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

01:56:46.541 --> 01:56:48.209
You know, I was young.

01:56:50.087 --> 01:56:52.588
I've been developing
a theory.

01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:11.524
I believe I can prove
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

01:57:11.608 --> 01:57:13.734
That everything,
everything is connected.

01:57:13.819 --> 01:57:16.237
That it's all part
of the same subject.

01:57:17.656 --> 01:57:19.281
When was the last time
you ate?

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:21.158
Excuse me?

01:57:21.284 --> 01:57:22.576
You know, food.

01:57:23.412 --> 01:57:24.412
Oh. . . Uh. ..

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:27.790
My wife,
she loves mayonnaise.

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.128
Thank you.

01:57:34.131 --> 01:57:35.297
Go on.

01:57:36.133 --> 01:57:39.427
The function is in
the two categories.

01:57:39.511 --> 01:57:40.803
Mmm-hmm.

01:57:44.641 --> 01:57:45.641
Alicia!

01:57:47.436 --> 01:57:48.728
Alicia!

01:57:48.812 --> 01:57:50.730
. . .and meet together
at a maximum speed

01:57:50.814 --> 01:57:53.566
of, let us say,
1 0 miles per hour.

01:57:54.359 --> 01:57:56.652
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle "B,"

01:57:57.404 --> 01:58:00.448
and the fly,
who can travel at
20 miles an hour,

01:58:00.532 --> 01:58:03.701
leaves the tire of bicycle "B"
and flies to the tire
of bicycle "A,"

01:58:03.785 --> 01:58:07.246
and backwards and forwards,
and so on and so forth,
until the two bikes collide

01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:09.623
and the poor
little fly is squashed.

01:58:09.708 --> 01:58:13.753
This is the important thing
about actually focusing in
and comprehending

01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:16.756
the area that
you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific,

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:20.259
and it is an art form,
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

01:58:20.343 --> 01:58:21.844
especially the people
from Biology.

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:23.429
Don't listen to
any of those people.

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:25.514
Let me go back to
what you were doing before

01:58:25.599 --> 01:58:26.891
because I think I
might want to steal this

01:58:26.975 --> 01:58:28.225
and write a book
and get famous.

01:58:30.479 --> 01:58:32.104
I was thinking
that I might teach.

01:58:34.566 --> 01:58:37.401
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

01:58:39.321 --> 01:58:42.114
John, besides,
you're a terrible teacher.

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:44.992
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

01:58:46.536 --> 01:58:49.205
I was hoping there
still might be something
I could contribute.

01:58:50.207 --> 01:58:51.373
What about the. ..

01:58:52.292 --> 01:58:55.127
Well, you know.
Are they gone?

01:59:02.344 --> 01:59:04.136
No, they're not gone.

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:06.722
And maybe
they never will be.

01:59:06.807 --> 01:59:07.807
But I've gotten
used to ignoring them,

01:59:07.891 --> 01:59:10.810
and I think, as a result,
they've given up on me.

01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:14.647
You think that's
what it's like with

01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:17.066
all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

01:59:18.235 --> 01:59:20.611
You've got to
keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?

01:59:21.238 --> 01:59:23.322
John,
they haunt you though.

01:59:25.158 --> 01:59:28.244
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted
by their past.

01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:34.124
Well, good-bye.

01:59:34.209 --> 01:59:35.709
John, I'll talk
to the department.

01:59:38.421 --> 01:59:39.755
Maybe in the spring.

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:47.513
Hey, Nash.

01:59:49.641 --> 01:59:53.310
You scared?

01:59:56.356 --> 02:00:00.526
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.111
Stupefied by you.

02:00:03.154 --> 02:00:05.739
Now you ought
best ring Alicia,
or you're gonna get me. ..

02:00:05.824 --> 02:00:07.491
I'll ring her.
. . .in an awful
lot of trouble.

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.747
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

02:00:13.832 --> 02:00:15.666
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:18.586
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
Monday, sir.

02:00:18.962 --> 02:00:20.504
Professor Nash?

02:00:23.925 --> 02:00:25.050
Can you see him?

02:00:25.886 --> 02:00:27.469
Yeah.
You sure?

02:00:28.138 --> 02:00:31.515
Positive? He's within
your vision? Good.

02:00:32.684 --> 02:00:35.185
Forgive me,
I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

02:00:35.312 --> 02:00:36.896
See you next week,
Professor.
See you next week.

02:00:38.773 --> 02:00:40.566
So now that I know
that you're real,

02:00:40.692 --> 02:00:42.484
who are you,
and what can I do for you?

02:00:43.987 --> 02:00:46.405
Professor,
my name is Thomas King.

02:00:46.489 --> 02:00:47.615
Thomas King?
Mmm-hmm.

02:00:47.699 --> 02:00:51.785
And I'm here to tell you that
you're being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.338
Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

02:01:02.422 --> 02:01:06.175
Over the past few years,
your equilibrium
has become a cornerstone

02:01:06.259 --> 02:01:07.593
of modern economics.

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:09.845
Suddenly,
everybody likes that one.

02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:14.600
What about my work on
other some such projects,
like manifold embedding?

02:01:14.684 --> 02:01:18.395
The application of
your bargaining problem

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:22.316
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases. ..

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.901
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

02:01:23.985 --> 02:01:26.028
I never would
have considered that.

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:31.158
Have I just reached
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

02:01:31.242 --> 02:01:33.118
No, you haven't.

02:01:33.203 --> 02:01:35.079
Because I wouldn't
have thought of that.

02:01:40.293 --> 02:01:41.543
Shall we have tea?

02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:47.967
I don't go in there.
I usually just take my
sandwich in the library.

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.887
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

02:01:52.931 --> 02:01:56.392
Most commercially
available brands of tea

02:01:56.476 --> 02:01:58.602
are not suitable to
my palate, you see.

02:01:58.687 --> 02:02:00.104
I'm not. ..

02:02:00.188 --> 02:02:03.482
There are some
Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough.

02:02:03.566 --> 02:02:05.567
I enjoy the flavor
that they have.

02:02:05.652 --> 02:02:08.612
I have not been in this room
for quite some many years.

02:02:08.697 --> 02:02:10.656
I wonder what tea
they serve.

02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:14.702
Why, thank you,
young lady.

02:02:16.538 --> 02:02:20.374
Things have certainly
changed around here.
I have a son that age.

02:02:22.127 --> 02:02:23.335
Harvard.

02:02:28.258 --> 02:02:29.258
Hmm.

02:02:29.342 --> 02:02:31.510
I would have thought

02:02:31.594 --> 02:02:34.346
the nominations for
the Nobel Prize
would've been secret.

02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:37.808
I would have thought
you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

02:02:38.727 --> 02:02:40.185
That is generally
the case, yes,

02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:42.187
but these are
special circumstances.

02:02:44.274 --> 02:02:45.941
The awards are substantial.

02:02:46.818 --> 02:02:49.820
They require private funding.
As such,

02:02:50.989 --> 02:02:53.115
the image of the Nobel is. ..

02:02:55.618 --> 02:02:58.495
Oh, I see. So, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

02:02:59.831 --> 02:03:03.751
Find out if I would
screw everything up
if I actually won?

02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:08.589
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and
squawk like a chicken,

02:03:08.673 --> 02:03:10.049
things of this nature?

02:03:10.133 --> 02:03:11.925
Something like that, yes.

02:03:13.595 --> 02:03:14.928
Would I embarrass you?

02:03:19.476 --> 02:03:20.809
Yes, it is possible.

02:03:24.314 --> 02:03:28.776
You see, I am crazy.

02:03:31.279 --> 02:03:33.030
I take the
newer medications,

02:03:37.118 --> 02:03:39.286
but I still see things
that are not here.

02:03:42.207 --> 02:03:43.832
I just choose not
to acknowledge them.

02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:50.839
Like a diet of the mind,
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:55.469
Like my appetite
for patterns.

02:03:57.639 --> 02:04:00.849
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:03.685
Professor Nash.

02:04:08.858 --> 02:04:10.984
It's good to
have you here, John.

02:04:12.237 --> 02:04:13.570
Thank you.

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.910
It's an honor, sir.

02:04:20.745 --> 02:04:21.870
Thank you very much.

02:04:22.747 --> 02:04:24.039
A privilege, Professor.

02:04:28.878 --> 02:04:30.212
Professor.

02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:36.802
Nicely done, John.

02:04:36.928 --> 02:04:38.262
Thank you, Tom.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:44.017
Thank you.

02:04:52.569 --> 02:04:54.069
Thank you, Ed.

02:05:02.579 --> 02:05:04.663
That was certainly
most unexpected.

02:05:26.811 --> 02:05:28.145
Thank you.

02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:34.276
I've always
believed in numbers,

02:05:35.987 --> 02:05:38.947
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason.

02:05:40.366 --> 02:05:46.955
But after
a lifetime of such pursuits,
I ask, what truly is logic?

02:05:48.666 --> 02:05:50.083
Who decides reason?

02:05:52.212 --> 02:05:57.132
My quest has taken me
through the physical,
the metaphysical,

02:05:59.427 --> 02:06:03.513
the delusional and back.

02:06:05.975 --> 02:06:08.644
And I have made
the most important
discovery of my career.

02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:13.482
The most important
discovery of my life.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:19.655
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love

02:06:20.949 --> 02:06:23.283
that any logical
reasons can be found.

02:06:27.288 --> 02:06:29.623
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

02:06:31.668 --> 02:06:33.252
You are the reason I am.

02:06:38.716 --> 02:06:40.217
You are all my reasons.

02:06:45.223 --> 02:06:46.556
Thank you.

02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:42.404
So nice to
have met you.

02:07:45.783 --> 02:07:47.326
I'll call for the car, Dad.

02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:48.702
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

02:07:51.164 --> 02:07:52.456
Are you ready to go now?

02:07:52.582 --> 02:07:53.874
Yes, I am.

02:07:53.958 --> 02:07:55.709
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

02:07:56.461 --> 02:07:57.836
Thank you so much.

02:07:59.172 --> 02:08:00.505
Thank you.

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:05.427
What is it?
What's wrong?

02:08:09.849 --> 02:08:11.099
Nothing.

02:08:12.435 --> 02:08:13.435
Nothing at all.

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:17.481
Come with me,
young lady.

02:08:19.359 --> 02:08:23.487
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

02:08:24.614 --> 02:08:26.281
Where's it going to?
