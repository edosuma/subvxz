Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:01.376 --> 02:03.982
This is a robbery!

02:10.894 --> 02:13.398
This is BY3462 reporting

02:13.400 --> 02:16.202
above New York, is there
anyone in the vicinity?

02:16.204 --> 02:18.677
I repeat, anyone in the
vicinity?

02:22.350 --> 02:25.688
Detective Frank
McMillian here, what is it?

02:25.690 --> 02:27.459
Where are you?

02:27.461 --> 02:29.596
We're on the upper
east side near 82nd Street,

02:29.598 --> 02:30.968
how can we assist?

02:32.939 --> 02:35.207
There's two suspects
that have reportedly robbed

02:35.209 --> 02:37.947
Jenkin's Jewelry Store,
heading into Jamaica Boat Yard,

02:37.949 --> 02:39.583
can you deal with it?

02:39.585 --> 02:41.356
Yeah.

02:55.082 --> 02:57.320
Okay, there they go.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.961
Hell are those fuckers going?

03:27.080 --> 03:29.318
Shit, where the fuck
are they now?

03:41.842 --> 03:44.145
Fuckers are on the roof.

04:07.394 --> 04:09.398
Shit, they're on
the fucking roof again.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.302
That's it, we got 'em.

04:30.472 --> 04:32.646
You're not gonna
get away that easy.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.395
My name is Frank McMillian.

06:06.397 --> 06:09.002
I'm 55 years old,

06:09.004 --> 06:12.743
and a detective in
the New York Police Department.

06:12.745 --> 06:14.847
I've been serving
for over 30 years

06:14.849 --> 06:17.619
and the job is getting harder.

06:17.621 --> 06:20.190
Criminals seem
to be getting younger,

06:20.192 --> 06:22.963
and the crimes,
well, they seem to be

06:22.965 --> 06:25.001
getting tougher the older I get.

06:25.003 --> 06:28.307
I'm used to dealing
with murderers, rapists,

06:28.309 --> 06:32.615
gun shootings, robberies,
whatever shit comes along.

06:32.617 --> 06:34.486
Whenever there's a dirty case,

06:34.488 --> 06:36.623
they just seem to call on me.

06:36.625 --> 06:39.597
I'm like a New York Dirty Harry.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.867
But in the past we could
do something about it,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.339
kick a few asses without the law

06:44.341 --> 06:46.511
or the do-gooders kicking ours.

06:46.513 --> 06:48.614
The law would turn a blind eye.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.885
Now if you step on
a criminal's toes,

06:50.887 --> 06:53.057
he screams to
the Justice Department

06:53.059 --> 06:55.161
about unfair treatment.

06:55.163 --> 06:57.297
But what about the victim?

06:57.299 --> 06:58.835
Who speaks for them?

06:58.837 --> 07:01.708
Until recently, I thought I did.

07:01.710 --> 07:04.947
Then one day as we were
on our usual surveillance,

07:04.949 --> 07:07.017
call came in from
the whirly bird.

07:07.019 --> 07:10.457
We were only a couple of blocks
away so we took the call.

07:10.459 --> 07:11.995
That's when we saw it,

07:11.997 --> 07:14.899
the two motherfuckers running
through Atkin's Boat Yard.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.806
It was supposed to be
an easy arrest.

07:17.808 --> 07:20.511
The bird in the sky had
told us that these two guys

07:20.513 --> 07:23.217
had stolen a bunch
of jewels from the local mall,

07:23.219 --> 07:25.388
and that they were on foot.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.725
So, they should
be easy to catch.

07:27.727 --> 07:29.830
But then nothing is that easy.

07:29.832 --> 07:34.238
Joel Wiseman wasn't really
a friend, or a drinking buddy,

07:34.240 --> 07:35.875
but he was a good man.

07:35.877 --> 07:38.748
He had two kids,
and a sex-crazed wife

07:38.750 --> 07:41.821
that would poke anyone
after a couple of vodkas.

07:41.823 --> 07:43.524
I should know,

07:43.526 --> 07:45.728
I wrestled with the woman
once or twice

07:45.730 --> 07:48.199
when my cock
spoke louder than my head.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.906
But what the hell,
these things happen.

07:50.908 --> 07:54.512
Hmm, who gives
a shit now, he's dead.

07:54.514 --> 07:57.218
So he was a nice guy.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.523
But most important,
he was my partner.

07:59.525 --> 08:02.563
Now, the whole
process starts again.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.267
Finding someone I can trust,

08:05.269 --> 08:08.574
and will protect your back when
you go up against the bad guys.

08:08.576 --> 08:11.514
Joel did that for me,
more than once.

08:11.516 --> 08:15.521
Always wanted to be
a policeman, protect and serve.

08:15.523 --> 08:17.592
But it all changed that day.

08:17.594 --> 08:21.133
Joel did that for me,
more than once.

08:21.135 --> 08:23.070
Maybe I'm getting tired,

08:23.072 --> 08:25.708
maybe I'm getting
too old for this job.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.277
You can only do it for so long,

08:27.279 --> 08:28.915
especially when
your hands are tied.

08:28.917 --> 08:33.222
If they'd only let me do what I'm
best at doing, banging heads.

08:33.224 --> 08:35.126
Maybe it's time to retire.

08:35.128 --> 08:38.735
But who then is gonna kick
the shit out of these assholes?

08:38.736 --> 08:44.077
Heh, maybe I should go do it
alone, become a vigilante.

08:44.078 --> 08:47.384
It's more my style,
a Shogun assassin

08:47.386 --> 08:50.624
like they had in Japan, oh yeah,

08:50.626 --> 08:53.265
who needs the police
department anyway.

09:03.652 --> 09:06.355
New York City.

09:06.357 --> 09:08.492
Home to the Empire
State Building,

09:08.494 --> 09:11.465
Times Square, Statue of Liberty.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.742
10 million people make their
way through New York like rats.

09:15.744 --> 09:18.179
Work themselves worthless.

09:18.181 --> 09:20.851
It's a fast-paced,
globally influential

09:20.853 --> 09:26.263
center of art, culture,
fashion, finance...

09:26.265 --> 09:28.501
and crime.

09:28.503 --> 09:30.871
The city's five boroughs sit
between the Hudson River

09:30.873 --> 09:35.615
and the Atlantic Ocean,
with Manhattan at its core.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.388
New York is the largest city
in the United States.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.963
Known as the Big Apple
to some, Gotham to others,

09:42.965 --> 09:48.844
but to its occupants, it is
the city that never sleeps.

11:09.738 --> 11:12.576
Don't you ever
laugh at me again,

11:12.578 --> 11:14.949
you low-life fucking whore!

11:26.838 --> 11:29.308
You won't be slapping
any more girls around

11:29.310 --> 11:32.652
with your little cock,
will you, tough guy?

11:54.995 --> 11:57.133
Mummy, mummy!

12:05.517 --> 12:08.521
Mummy's gonna have
a big lunch now little girl,

12:08.523 --> 12:09.923
- just wait and see!
- No!

12:13.933 --> 12:16.773
I hope your momma's
gonna have a deep throat.

12:17.506 --> 12:19.143
Please no!

13:21.067 --> 13:23.503
It's bad luck to kill a raven.

13:23.505 --> 13:27.079
It is for the bird.

13:29.617 --> 13:31.054
Count me out.

13:32.021 --> 13:35.127
Too rich for you, Shylock?
Or you lost face?

13:35.129 --> 13:38.767
Or maybe the raven's put the
scares on you, eh?

13:38.769 --> 13:41.272
You Jews
are all the same,

13:41.274 --> 13:43.242
you want the money,
bloodsucker,

13:43.244 --> 13:44.845
but you don't
want to take the risks.

13:44.847 --> 13:48.720
Leave it to us good
Catholic boys, eh, McMillian?

13:48.722 --> 13:51.091
Boo!

13:51.093 --> 13:55.033
It's like I said,
no show, no go, Shylock.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.539
Ah, now where were we?

13:57.541 --> 14:02.050
Oh yeah, ,
just you and me, McMillian.

14:03.118 --> 14:07.056
Uhhmm.
Ah,.

14:07.058 --> 14:10.062
It's time to win my money
back and a little more!

14:10.064 --> 14:13.069
And if you are
a good boy, maybe,

14:13.071 --> 14:15.139
and I do mean maybe,

14:15.141 --> 14:17.545
I'll take a marker
against that badge

14:17.547 --> 14:19.248
you wear so precariously.

14:19.250 --> 14:23.056
What do you say McMillian,
you want to be on my payroll?

14:23.058 --> 14:25.095
Earn some decent
money for a change?

14:25.997 --> 14:27.665
You came here
to gamble slime ball,

14:27.667 --> 14:29.972
or romance me with
that tongue of yours?

14:31.173 --> 14:35.915
Tell your Rottweiler to sit down
before he gets hurt.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.319
I'm not so easy to
throw out of a window.

14:38.321 --> 14:41.425
Ha, an uncorruptible
policeman, eh boss?

14:41.427 --> 14:44.163
Now that's not something
you see every day,

14:44.165 --> 14:46.703
especially not in
this city.

14:46.705 --> 14:48.105
You think he's funny, Cyclops?

14:48.107 --> 14:50.810
I'll show you who's funny
when I win this hand.

14:50.812 --> 14:53.182
Then we'll see you laugh on
the other side of your face!

14:53.184 --> 14:55.588
You're hoping I'll
get my boy here,

14:55.590 --> 14:58.194
to teach you some flying lessons
like he did with Dragman.

14:59.363 --> 15:02.200
We're here to
play cards, Wynchapel.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.302
So play.

15:03.304 --> 15:05.840
Oh.

15:05.842 --> 15:08.111
Now that's a tough guy.

15:08.113 --> 15:12.053
Ain't you, McMillian,
a real tough guy.

15:12.055 --> 15:14.959
Well, don't blame me, tough guy,

15:14.961 --> 15:17.564
when you have to
take the bus home.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.134
Do you want to bet on that?

15:19.136 --> 15:21.341
- What?
- Are you deaf?

15:22.911 --> 15:24.178
You're challenging me,
Detective,

15:24.180 --> 15:26.449
with that hard-earned
pension fund,

15:26.451 --> 15:29.224
or is it mob money you scabbed from
my fellow business associates?

15:32.195 --> 15:36.070
No show, no go.
That's what you said, remember?

15:40.245 --> 15:41.712
You'll take a marker?

15:41.714 --> 15:44.084
Do I look like
a loan shark to you?

15:44.086 --> 15:45.888
Why don't you ask
your accountant?

15:45.890 --> 15:47.824
Looks like you're the one

15:47.826 --> 15:50.700
taking that bus home,
Boss!

15:59.417 --> 16:01.990
I don't lose face to no one!

16:04.360 --> 16:06.198
Especially from
a fucking accountant.

16:08.903 --> 16:10.269
You got a problem with this?

16:10.271 --> 16:12.406
He's your
accountant, Wynchapel.

16:12.408 --> 16:16.082
Well I'll have to get another bean
counter to cook the books then, won't I?

16:16.084 --> 16:18.854
You got him good,
Boss, real good.

16:18.856 --> 16:21.257
That fucker won't be
mouthing off to you again.

16:21.259 --> 16:22.930
You bet he won't.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.934
All new situation, eh, Boss?

16:25.936 --> 16:28.406
A dead kike, and his money.

16:28.408 --> 16:30.881
So, can we proceed?

16:32.416 --> 16:34.852
You want me to teach
this joker a lesson?

16:34.854 --> 16:37.223
Teach him some manners,
Mr. Wynchapel?

16:37.225 --> 16:38.095
Later.

16:39.262 --> 16:41.064
Later?

16:41.066 --> 16:42.035
Right.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.654
A full house.

16:52.656 --> 16:54.726
Unbeatable even for you!

16:54.728 --> 16:56.295
Not with that it ain't.

16:56.297 --> 16:57.900
Oh, ah!

17:04.146 --> 17:08.051
McMillian, no, please,
I, I wouldn't have hurt you,

17:08.054 --> 17:09.387
I swear as God as my witness,

17:09.390 --> 17:11.796
I-I-I wouldn't touch
a single hair on your head!

17:32.269 --> 17:37.276
The date was
April, the 26th, almost 10 years ago.

17:37.278 --> 17:40.617
It was the first time that I
encountered Mr. William Bard.

17:40.619 --> 17:44.124
Heir to the Bard billions.

17:44.126 --> 17:45.860
And known sociopath.

17:45.862 --> 17:48.198
He'd just robbed
this old family Beck.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.540
Wasn't going to be the last
time our paths would cross.

17:59.924 --> 18:01.291
You know we got
him in our sights,

18:01.293 --> 18:03.331
they'll be down 57th Street!

18:13.283 --> 18:15.386
Shoot those
fuckers Gilly, shoot them!

18:26.912 --> 18:29.816
Okay Gilly, shoot
those motherfuckers!

18:31.754 --> 18:34.594
Go on Gilly, shoot 'em!

18:55.603 --> 18:58.940
Time to shoot us a
pig or two, Gilly!

19:03.051 --> 19:04.351
Yeah...

19:06.390 --> 19:07.694
We're gonna need more men!

19:09.262 --> 19:12.434
In fact we're gonna need an
army to stop this madman!

19:20.518 --> 19:24.224
Ram the bastard off the road
before he kills someone!

19:27.299 --> 19:30.136
Damn, push this
fucker off the road!

19:34.614 --> 19:36.816
Take the next turnoff
and go down 58th,

19:36.818 --> 19:39.120
and cut him off
down Second Avenue.

19:39.122 --> 19:41.227
That'll surprise
him, mad bastard!

19:48.609 --> 19:51.681
I love this city!

19:55.087 --> 19:58.058
Yay, there he
is, head him off!

20:02.302 --> 20:05.241
Oh my god!

20:06.143 --> 20:07.645
Shit!

20:07.647 --> 20:12.621
New York, New York, so good they named it twice!

20:16.129 --> 20:17.497
This is Tim Vine

20:17.499 --> 20:19.367
from CNB news
reporting to you today,

20:19.369 --> 20:22.340
the incredible breaking
story that William Bard,

20:22.342 --> 20:24.376
the heir of the
Bard Corporation,

20:24.378 --> 20:27.786
has been jailed for 11 years
at the New York Supreme Court.

20:38.207 --> 20:40.109
There's not a prison
that can hold me,

20:40.111 --> 20:43.449
for I, I'm William Bard!

22:39.649 --> 22:41.985
Good of you to
come Miss Fawkes.

22:41.987 --> 22:45.094
Did you manage to bring
that, book we spoke about?

22:52.007 --> 22:53.943
Well thank you, Miss Fawkes.

22:53.945 --> 22:57.482
It's so much nicer having a
black sheep in the family.

22:57.484 --> 22:59.757
Makes life so more
comfortable, don't you think?

23:24.941 --> 23:28.680
Light's out Bard,
time to go to bed.

23:28.682 --> 23:31.819
You've got two minutes,
and then everything goes dark!

23:55.201 --> 23:56.401
What did I tell you?

23:56.403 --> 23:57.974
Lights out!

24:13.103 --> 24:15.107
A shame, I really liked him.

24:17.244 --> 24:19.950
Showtime, folks!

24:29.570 --> 24:31.772
So what you're telling me,

24:31.774 --> 24:33.240
is that no one knows
what's going on,

24:33.242 --> 24:36.615
and not one of you knew that Dr. Fawkes
was possibly having an affair

24:36.617 --> 24:39.186
with a prisoner,
is that correct?

24:47.706 --> 24:50.776
Hello sir, Tenison here!

24:50.778 --> 24:52.948
It seems that
the CCTV footage

24:52.950 --> 24:55.385
you requested
on William Bard,

24:55.387 --> 24:56.754
has been erased!

24:56.756 --> 25:00.697
But after some time I have been
able to rebuild the data for you,

25:00.699 --> 25:04.103
but there is some digital
drop outs within the timeline.

25:04.105 --> 25:07.711
Transfer image
to the main video monitor.

25:07.713 --> 25:10.816
The images you now
are watching was taken from

25:10.818 --> 25:14.222
CCTV cameras that were
hidden in the lane,

25:14.224 --> 25:17.597
the day that William Bard
got facially injured.

25:17.599 --> 25:21.304
This is the Lombard family coming
home from a night at the theater.

25:21.306 --> 25:24.076
Sir, as you can see,

25:24.078 --> 25:27.650
they never expected what was
going to happen to them next.

25:27.652 --> 25:33.729
Unfortunately for them, a shortcut ended
up being a quick way to the morgue.

25:38.740 --> 25:42.814
William is going
to love you.

25:42.816 --> 25:44.685
But, we
haven't got any money.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.591
I didn't ask for any!

25:50.196 --> 25:52.365
I, I only have
a couple of bucks on me

25:52.367 --> 25:54.270
but I, I've got plenty
of credit cards,

25:54.272 --> 25:55.842
you're more than
welcome to them.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.348
By the way,
just take my wallet.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.691
Yeah, I know you, you're
William Bard, right I...

26:04.693 --> 26:07.831
I, I-I'm Micheal Lombard,
I used to work with your father,

26:07.833 --> 26:10.870
in, in the Accounting
Department back in Queens.

26:10.872 --> 26:13.211
I, I-I suppose
I work for you now.

26:14.279 --> 26:16.116
Did you like my father?

26:17.653 --> 26:19.323
You can be honest,
Mr. Accountant.

26:21.292 --> 26:24.198
No I, I don't suppose I did.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.138
Me neither.

26:40.665 --> 26:43.735
An honest man is so
hard to come by these days.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.575
You bastard!

26:47.546 --> 26:49.383
You asked him to tell you!

26:51.386 --> 26:53.888
Yes I did,
didn't I?

26:53.890 --> 26:55.863
Why did you shoot him?

26:57.198 --> 26:59.968
I like to kill
things, it makes me relax.

26:59.970 --> 27:02.339
You're
nothing but a murderer,

27:02.341 --> 27:04.278
he did nothing to you!

27:06.916 --> 27:09.121
Shut the bitch up!
I'm trying to think!

27:25.954 --> 27:28.124
Look, Lombard!

27:28.126 --> 27:30.127
You take the lom
out of the Lombard,

27:30.129 --> 27:31.932
and what have you got, the Bard!

27:31.934 --> 27:33.467
Now that's funny!

27:33.469 --> 27:35.072
We could be cousins!

27:35.074 --> 27:37.142
How about a fuck, cuz?

27:37.144 --> 27:38.615
That's
funny.

27:39.917 --> 27:41.250
What's funny?

27:41.252 --> 27:42.853
It was!

27:42.855 --> 27:44.223
You shot your accountant,

27:44.225 --> 27:46.798
now you'll never know how much
money you have.

27:49.770 --> 27:53.444
- 'Cause you're stupid.
- Stupid, you think I'm stupid?

27:54.980 --> 27:57.616
No, I was just saying.

27:57.618 --> 28:02.292
- Saying what?
- Nothing Boss, nothing.

28:02.294 --> 28:03.996
Nothing, saying nothing?

28:03.998 --> 28:05.969
What do you mean nothing?

28:07.070 --> 28:09.106
I don't need a nothing!

28:12.347 --> 28:15.454
That's right, now you're
really seeing right.

28:17.157 --> 28:18.626
Some people like to paint,

28:18.628 --> 28:19.793
some people like to sing,

28:19.795 --> 28:22.265
others like to fuck!

28:22.267 --> 28:24.738
I like to kill people!

28:24.740 --> 28:27.847
It relaxes me!

28:29.114 --> 28:31.018
When you have money
you can do anything.

28:33.924 --> 28:34.961
You're mad!

28:35.994 --> 28:37.296
Mad?

28:37.298 --> 28:40.138
I'll be known as
the mad, bad Bard!

28:41.839 --> 28:43.978
Okay honey bun, watch it.

28:45.146 --> 28:48.217
Please, help us!

28:57.004 --> 28:58.671
Take it easy,
have you gotten where

28:58.673 --> 29:00.875
I slip my cock into
that pink fold,

29:00.877 --> 29:02.713
between those legs of yours!

29:10.530 --> 29:12.902
No!

29:31.338 --> 29:33.042
What
does it look like?

29:35.848 --> 29:37.318
I've seen worse.

29:39.722 --> 29:42.392
Worse, worse, where?

29:42.394 --> 29:43.995
In the fucking abattoir?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.901
- No!
- I'm a billionaire!

29:46.903 --> 29:49.105
Not a fucking!

29:49.107 --> 29:51.747
Oh my god no, ah...

30:01.666 --> 30:05.338
I want you to
scan the city for a Dr. Zilia Fawkes.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.274
Dating again, sir?

30:07.276 --> 30:09.514
She was and employee
at the Bedlam Asylum before

30:09.516 --> 30:11.785
she became an assassin
for William Bard.

30:11.787 --> 30:14.021
I get your point sir,

30:14.023 --> 30:16.260
but it has been
quite a while

30:16.262 --> 30:19.566
since you even went out
to dinner with a young lady,

30:19.568 --> 30:21.937
or Commissioner
Rosen, come to that.

30:21.939 --> 30:23.975
Tenison
you might be right,

30:23.977 --> 30:26.246
but at the moment
I need to know,

30:26.248 --> 30:28.786
how can someone like William
Bard corrupt the mind

30:28.788 --> 30:30.826
of a woman like
Dr. Zilia Fawkes.

30:32.026 --> 30:34.898
She was rich, intelligent,

30:34.900 --> 30:37.238
but the fiend still
made her his own.

30:39.709 --> 30:43.250
Maybe this club, the Vertical
Smile will hold the answers.

30:44.317 --> 30:46.286
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:46.288 --> 30:47.989
dames and monsieur!

30:47.991 --> 30:51.262
Let me welcome you to
the home of the exotic,

30:51.264 --> 30:54.403
the pleasure dome
of the perverse,

30:54.405 --> 30:58.110
the Sin City of America,
the Vertical Smile.

33:50.825 --> 33:52.896
You want
something, Detective?

33:59.408 --> 34:00.945
Light me.

34:21.952 --> 34:24.625
So tough guy, why the visit?

34:27.597 --> 34:30.536
Why did you
break William Bard out of prison?

34:32.139 --> 34:34.043
Now why, Detective?

34:35.112 --> 34:38.384
I'll ask one more time.

34:38.386 --> 34:41.989
Why did your break William
Bard out of prison?

34:41.992 --> 34:44.129
Are you in love with him?

34:44.130 --> 34:46.069
You could say.

34:47.505 --> 34:48.708
Why?

34:50.510 --> 34:53.681
Would that stop you
wanting to fuck me?

34:53.683 --> 34:55.382
Just
answer my questions.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.354
Or do you want me to arrest you?

34:57.356 --> 35:00.196
Didn't think it would.

35:10.818 --> 35:14.923
As William Bard wandered the
night clubs of New York,

35:14.925 --> 35:19.264
looking for that ultimate
fix, his answer suddenly came.

35:19.266 --> 35:22.071
William Bard didn't
start out depraved.

35:22.073 --> 35:24.441
He just became evil,

35:24.443 --> 35:29.686
and the catalyst event of depravity
took him down that road to Hell.

35:29.688 --> 35:34.328
Her name was Elizabeth
Bathory, Hungarian noblewoman

35:34.330 --> 35:37.569
and alleged serial killer who had
signed a pact with the devil,

35:37.571 --> 35:39.573
along
with her collaborators,

35:39.575 --> 35:44.582
tortured and killed
over 650 young women,

35:44.584 --> 35:49.292
so she could stay young,
by bathing in their blood.

35:49.294 --> 35:54.268
Now in New York, she lies in waiting
for like-minded individuals

35:54.270 --> 35:56.372
to turn into followers,

35:56.374 --> 36:00.648
as they are embraced
by the Dark Lord Satan.

36:38.492 --> 36:39.727
Whatever you're
selling sweetheart,

36:39.729 --> 36:42.765
I'm not buying, I'm
just here for the show.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.104
Are you sure Mr. Bard,

36:45.106 --> 36:47.909
because you really look
like you need something.

36:47.911 --> 36:49.345
No thanks.

36:49.347 --> 36:52.354
What about
something a little different?

36:53.790 --> 36:55.859
I've just been fucked tonight,

36:55.861 --> 36:57.866
and I'm really not
interested in drugs.

36:59.534 --> 37:02.806
What about
an experience Mr. Bard,

37:02.808 --> 37:06.948
something you haven't
tried or will try again?

37:06.950 --> 37:08.684
You won't regret it.

37:08.686 --> 37:10.022
I doubt that.

37:17.938 --> 37:19.506
Okay you got my attention.

37:19.508 --> 37:20.377
How much?

37:22.380 --> 37:23.517
Nothing!

40:47.255 --> 40:49.892
Okay Miss Bathory,
why am I here?

40:49.894 --> 40:52.499
Be quiet William, and listen.

40:56.609 --> 40:58.878
Do you believe in
the cards, William?

40:58.880 --> 41:00.948
No, I don't.

41:00.950 --> 41:03.055
A shame.
You should.

41:04.189 --> 41:05.393
Take one.

41:14.277 --> 41:17.113
Ah, the Hanged Man.

41:17.115 --> 41:21.790
That indicates that you are
at a crossroads in your life.

41:21.792 --> 41:25.266
You want more, but you
don't know how to get it.

41:27.036 --> 41:29.939
Your family are worth billions,

41:29.941 --> 41:32.747
but that doesn't give
you what you want.

41:35.719 --> 41:38.058
Again.

41:42.800 --> 41:48.478
Ah, the Magician indicates that
you are a person without purpose.

41:49.782 --> 41:55.156
But, you have the ability
to be very powerful.

41:55.158 --> 41:57.564
If, you desire.

41:59.667 --> 42:00.770
Continue.

42:10.322 --> 42:11.956
This is the Fool,

42:11.958 --> 42:15.600
which you will become,
without guidance.

42:20.174 --> 42:23.449
This will unleash
the demon inside you,

42:24.817 --> 42:27.289
to its full potential.

42:31.363 --> 42:37.774
Fulfill your destiny and become
one with the dark side, Mr. Bard!

42:37.776 --> 42:41.850
Breathe it in, William.

42:51.104 --> 42:54.110
And tell me what you see!

44:31.204 --> 44:32.939
Within days,

44:32.941 --> 44:37.213
the drug that Elizabeth Bathory had
given William Bard had taken hold.

44:37.215 --> 44:41.957
Now he was on a mission to fulfill that dream,

44:41.959 --> 44:43.563
whatever the cost.

44:47.603 --> 44:51.509
Oh, please don't hurt us, please!

44:51.511 --> 44:53.112
We won't say a thing!

44:53.114 --> 44:56.285
You can leave and we won't even
mention that you were here!

44:56.287 --> 44:58.189
You've still got time to
go without anybody else

44:58.191 --> 44:59.858
knowing what you've done!

44:59.860 --> 45:02.800
Just please don't
hurt the children!

45:03.936 --> 45:06.606
Hurt you, whatever
gave you that idea?

45:06.608 --> 45:09.982
I like children,
especially the quiet ones!

45:10.916 --> 45:13.956
Boo!

45:15.526 --> 45:19.502
So tell me teacher, what
do you like to teach?

45:20.669 --> 45:21.605
English.

45:22.941 --> 45:25.008
Yeah but what?

45:25.010 --> 45:25.880
Drama.

45:27.015 --> 45:27.949
Drama?

45:27.951 --> 45:31.055
- Who?
- Shakespeare.

45:31.057 --> 45:34.798
Shakespeare!
I love Shakespeare!

45:36.835 --> 45:39.103
Is this a dagger
that I see before me?

45:39.105 --> 45:40.273
The handle before my hand?

45:40.275 --> 45:41.675
Come!

45:41.677 --> 45:42.847
Let me clench thee.

45:44.315 --> 45:47.355
Had me not, though
I had me still.

45:49.226 --> 45:53.001
Children, never forget
Shakespeare, he is real!

45:54.002 --> 45:54.871
Ah...

45:56.073 --> 45:57.974
Oh leave them alone please!

45:57.976 --> 45:58.879
I beseech you!

45:59.981 --> 46:02.452
They're so young, and innocent!

46:03.688 --> 46:06.526
Just how I like them!

46:06.528 --> 46:09.632
No, they're too young!

46:09.634 --> 46:11.736
Impressionable!
You mustn't!

46:11.738 --> 46:14.911
Mustn't I?

46:15.912 --> 46:18.917
They've done nothing
to you, or your men!

46:18.919 --> 46:20.420
For god's sake!

46:20.422 --> 46:22.192
They're just children!

46:25.565 --> 46:26.702
Take me if you want.

46:28.170 --> 46:30.574
Do what you need to do.

46:30.576 --> 46:33.447
But please,
don't hurt the children.

46:41.162 --> 46:43.900
Now would I?

46:43.902 --> 46:47.006
No, no, stop it!

46:47.008 --> 46:49.047
They're just children!

46:53.521 --> 46:54.857
Why should I?

46:56.193 --> 46:57.931
They're children.

46:59.098 --> 47:00.736
If you want to take
it out on anybody,

47:02.172 --> 47:06.882
do it to me, but not here.

47:12.560 --> 47:13.494
Where?

47:15.230 --> 47:17.603
Anywhere, away from here.

47:19.039 --> 47:20.108
The other room maybe.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.388
Thanks for the offer, Teach,

47:28.390 --> 47:31.094
but you're a little old for my
taste, you know what I mean?

47:31.096 --> 47:35.970
I like my
fruit a little... fresher.

47:38.478 --> 47:41.151
Now, Teacher
has the right idea.

47:44.189 --> 47:48.963
This is to all you in
the City of Los Angeles.

47:48.965 --> 47:53.640
If you don't bring me
$10 million by 6:00 PM tonight,

47:53.642 --> 47:57.145
her little friends here are
gonna be as dead as the bard,

47:57.147 --> 48:00.022
and their teacher!

48:02.726 --> 48:06.198
Ah, I'll be waiting!

48:09.841 --> 48:13.112
I'm standing here outside
Delmont High School

48:13.114 --> 48:15.049
in central Los Angeles.

48:15.051 --> 48:18.222
It's 6:30 PM on
a sunny evening,

48:18.224 --> 48:21.828
in a mild mannered suburb
of southern California.

48:21.830 --> 48:25.101
It was here,
at 10:00 AM this morning,

48:25.103 --> 48:28.610
that a man only known
to us as the Comedian

48:28.612 --> 48:30.046
with three of his henchmen,

48:30.048 --> 48:31.849
walked into the school

48:31.851 --> 48:33.820
and took schoolteacher
Mary Shelley,

48:33.822 --> 48:36.224
and 12 of her students hostage,

48:36.226 --> 48:40.199
demanding $10 million in
return for their safety.

48:40.201 --> 48:43.238
This is what happened
at 5:00 PM today.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.077
Some of you may find
this disturbing.

48:55.733 --> 48:57.036
We have your money!

48:58.237 --> 49:00.074
Now let the children
go as agreed!

49:01.075 --> 49:04.615
Back off G-man, or I'm gonna
kill her here right now!

49:04.617 --> 49:05.987
Well here's your money!

49:07.422 --> 49:09.056
Let her go.

49:09.058 --> 49:11.863
Let her go, is that what you want
me to do, let her go!

49:11.865 --> 49:14.199
Get down!

49:14.201 --> 49:15.570
Okay!

49:20.782 --> 49:23.622
Don't tell me what to do
again, do you understand?

49:24.556 --> 49:27.794
I said, "Do you understand?"

49:27.796 --> 49:28.732
Yes.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.836
Now back off!

49:31.838 --> 49:35.777
Or the next time, the kids in
there are gonna get it too!

49:35.779 --> 49:37.446
But you got your money!

49:37.448 --> 49:39.754
There's no need for
anybody else to be hurt!

49:42.192 --> 49:46.769
Do you think I care about
the money, Mr. Policeman?

49:52.478 --> 49:53.414
Not really.

49:57.222 --> 50:00.292
Burn!

50:00.294 --> 50:04.267
That was a replay of what
happened here today at 5:00 PM.

50:04.269 --> 50:06.775
Since then the
building has been under siege.

50:07.943 --> 50:09.644
Maybe we can ask the
arresting officer

50:09.646 --> 50:11.581
for some more information.

50:11.583 --> 50:14.957
Detective Stinwinksi, can you
tell us what happened here today?

50:16.092 --> 50:18.630
Uh, I've never seen
anything like this

50:18.632 --> 50:20.301
in my 20 years in the service.

50:21.436 --> 50:23.172
I mean, this
bastard and his men,

50:23.174 --> 50:25.145
they... they didn't care
about the money.

50:26.345 --> 50:28.016
They came here to
kill, that's all.

50:29.451 --> 50:30.322
Kill.

50:31.256 --> 50:33.091
My god they did.

50:33.093 --> 50:35.162
In the footage, we saw
Schoolteacher Mary Shelley

50:35.164 --> 50:38.234
get gunned down, why?

50:38.236 --> 50:40.474
God knows, I couldn't say.

50:42.178 --> 50:45.081
I mean, this Comedian,
he's a madman.

50:45.083 --> 50:47.990
But you gave this man his
money, what was his reason?

50:49.359 --> 50:50.362
I don't know.

50:51.864 --> 50:54.968
Detective, the money
was in the bag, wasn't it?

50:54.970 --> 50:57.708
Yeah, of course it was.

50:57.710 --> 51:00.348
Detective, was the
money in the bag or not?

51:04.155 --> 51:05.225
No, it wasn't.

51:06.828 --> 51:08.131
Look this state's broke.

51:09.031 --> 51:10.331
We asked the mayor and he said

51:10.333 --> 51:11.971
he couldn't afford
to pay any ransom!

51:13.106 --> 51:14.642
I just do what I'm told, okay?

51:14.644 --> 51:16.210
No questions asked!

51:16.212 --> 51:17.980
It's not my fault, okay?

51:17.982 --> 51:19.050
It's not my fault!

51:23.528 --> 51:24.795
Why did you do it?

51:24.797 --> 51:26.131
Let me loose here
man, ,

51:26.133 --> 51:28.334
love 'em ,
love 'em!

51:45.404 --> 51:46.906
My fellow Americans,

51:46.908 --> 51:50.012
today is a sad day
in American politics,

51:50.014 --> 51:51.414
for I am sorry to tell you

51:51.416 --> 51:54.319
that I have tried again,
and failed in vain,

51:54.321 --> 51:56.091
to bring in gun reform.

51:56.093 --> 51:58.328
A promise to you
the American public,

51:58.330 --> 52:00.365
a promise I made
before my election,

52:00.367 --> 52:02.636
as I believe it is
the number one killer

52:02.638 --> 52:05.275
within our country
and its citizens.

52:05.277 --> 52:06.611
And it needs to be stamped out,

52:06.613 --> 52:09.450
for I believe that
the wind has changed,

52:09.452 --> 52:12.089
and reform will be the only way

52:12.091 --> 52:13.425
that we'll be able to eradicate

52:13.427 --> 52:15.897
the criminal activities
of organized crime

52:15.899 --> 52:17.333
in our great country,

52:17.335 --> 52:20.406
which is starting to take a
strong hold of our nation.

52:20.408 --> 52:22.276
So for every man,
woman and child,

52:22.278 --> 52:24.414
I beseech you to be vigilant!

52:24.416 --> 52:27.887
If you see something
wrong, please report it,

52:27.889 --> 52:30.526
for only the just will win
this war against crime.

52:30.528 --> 52:32.631
Do not let the criminals win.

52:34.268 --> 52:36.739
Hello and welcome back

52:36.741 --> 52:39.544
to Breaking News, this
is Tim Vine from CNB News

52:39.546 --> 52:42.048
reporting to you
another incredible story

52:42.050 --> 52:44.387
about billionaire William Bard,

52:44.389 --> 52:46.124
heir to the Bard
Corporation,

52:46.126 --> 52:48.494
who was just jailed
for 123 years

52:48.496 --> 52:49.864
at New York Supreme Court,

52:49.866 --> 52:51.634
just 18 months after being sent

52:51.636 --> 52:54.576
to Bedlam Asylum for 11 years.

52:55.979 --> 52:58.214
In reality
William Bard should be dead.

52:58.216 --> 53:01.655
But that William Bard was no normal man.

53:01.657 --> 53:04.360
As a billionaire, he was
able to buy his way out

53:04.362 --> 53:06.264
of the electric chair,

53:06.266 --> 53:10.339
choosing instead the option
of being frozen alive.

53:10.341 --> 53:12.109
Went out with his
right-hand man Oswald,

53:12.111 --> 53:13.477
Wynchapel did.

53:13.479 --> 53:15.750
It was time for another person
to step into that position,

53:15.752 --> 53:18.625
and claim the Bard billions.

53:19.660 --> 53:22.496
Mayor Patrick O'Donnel
was that man.

53:22.498 --> 53:24.504
First he had to defrost him.

54:02.546 --> 54:05.147
Remember,
William Bard is in there.

54:05.149 --> 54:07.486
We want him out alive!

54:07.488 --> 54:10.391
Wynchapel's had use of
his money long enough!

54:10.393 --> 54:11.694
It's my turn now!

54:11.696 --> 54:13.832
Are you sure you
want to do this, Mayor?

54:13.834 --> 54:15.335
It's too late, Webber.

54:15.337 --> 54:17.573
Wynchapel is dead,
McMillian has killed him.

54:17.575 --> 54:19.677
What was Wynchapel
doing in this place?

54:19.679 --> 54:21.514
Cryogenics.

54:21.516 --> 54:24.353
He kept Bard alive so he
could filter his money.

54:24.355 --> 54:27.492
If he were dead, the
infrastructure of his companies

54:27.494 --> 54:29.998
would have dissolved,
and so would the cash.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.335
With Wynchapel gone
I can take over,

54:32.337 --> 54:35.742
but keep Bard frozen
at all costs!

54:35.744 --> 54:38.649
Okay, you're the boss.

54:38.651 --> 54:42.222
Well get the bastard
billionaire out of there!

54:43.828 --> 54:45.365
We've got him at last!

54:52.545 --> 54:54.848
This is Tim reporting
from Breakmount Cryogenetic

54:54.850 --> 54:57.418
High Security Prison
in Queens, New York.

54:57.420 --> 55:00.224
And I can now confirm that
no less than one hour ago,

55:00.226 --> 55:03.033
a group of men broke into
this facility behind me.

55:04.168 --> 55:05.603
There is no news as of yet

55:05.605 --> 55:07.574
if anything was damaged
or stolen,

55:07.576 --> 55:11.450
as authorities have not
confirmed or denied this report.

55:41.276 --> 55:43.113
Webber, you called?

55:44.650 --> 55:46.317
I must be mad being here!

55:46.319 --> 55:47.890
He's got informants everywhere!

55:48.991 --> 55:50.992
So, Weasel,

55:50.994 --> 55:54.803
is William Bard at the Metropolitan
Wharf, or is my information wrong?

55:56.338 --> 55:57.408
Yeah.

55:58.778 --> 56:01.249
Okay, you can go now.

56:02.250 --> 56:03.420
But we had a deal!

56:05.023 --> 56:06.791
Well if I need
to kill William Bard,

56:06.793 --> 56:10.535
I'll throw in the mayor as well,
how does that sound?

56:11.803 --> 56:13.473
Just do it, soon!

56:49.512 --> 56:51.548
Hello, Mayor,
good of you to come!

56:51.550 --> 56:53.985
"For now is the winter
of our discontent.

56:53.987 --> 56:56.558
Made glorious summer
by this son of York."

56:56.560 --> 57:00.065
I didn't come here
to listen to this shit!

57:00.067 --> 57:03.438
"...buried, our brows bound
with victorious wreaths,

57:03.440 --> 57:05.141
"Our bruised arms hung
up for monuments.

57:05.143 --> 57:06.878
"Our stern alarums chang'd
to merry meetings,

57:06.880 --> 57:09.215
"Our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

57:09.217 --> 57:11.386
"Grimvisag'd war hath
smooth'd his wrinkled front,

57:11.388 --> 57:13.592
"And now, instead of
mounting barbed steeds

57:13.594 --> 57:15.094
"to fright the souls of
fearful adversaries,

57:15.096 --> 57:16.598
he capers nimbly..."

57:16.600 --> 57:18.467
What the fuck is this?

57:18.469 --> 57:21.374
"But I, that am not
shap'd for sportive tricks,

57:21.376 --> 57:23.712
"I, that am rudely stamp'd,
and want love's majesty,

57:23.714 --> 57:25.750
"to strut before a
wanton ambling nymph!

57:25.752 --> 57:29.025
I, that am curtail'd..."

57:30.160 --> 57:32.596
"By dissembling nature. Deform'd, unfinish'd,

57:32.598 --> 57:35.267
- Shit!
- "And that so lamely and unfashionable

57:35.269 --> 57:37.507
"that dogs bark at me as I halt by them.

57:37.509 --> 57:40.045
"So why, I, in this weak
piping time of peace,

57:40.047 --> 57:42.049
"I have no delight,
to spy upon my shadow,

57:42.051 --> 57:43.785
"and descant on
mine own deformity,

57:43.787 --> 57:48.396
"since I will not be proved
a lover, I will be proved...

57:49.297 --> 57:50.933
a villain!"

57:57.280 --> 58:02.525
Betrayal, however slight,
Mayor, is not acceptable!

58:07.067 --> 58:08.270
Shit!

58:11.209 --> 58:12.745
I wasn't talking, to you!

58:50.787 --> 58:54.125
Hello and welcome back to Breaking News!

58:54.127 --> 58:56.965
This is Tim Vine from CNB News.

58:56.967 --> 59:00.103
We just received a report from
the New York Supreme Court

59:00.105 --> 59:03.912
that a verdict against Mayor
Patrick O'Donnel has just come in.

59:03.914 --> 59:05.783
Hello, Dan.

59:05.785 --> 59:10.358
Yes I can report that Mayor Patrick
O'Donnel has been acquitted,

59:10.360 --> 59:12.629
after allegations of corruption.

59:12.631 --> 59:15.768
The verdict came in
within just two hours.

59:15.770 --> 59:18.508
The 12-man jury was told
by the mayor's attorney

59:18.510 --> 59:21.781
that there was no evidence
to support this allegation,

59:21.783 --> 59:23.785
and that it was brought
against his client,

59:23.787 --> 59:26.725
by government officials
trying to stop his campaign

59:26.727 --> 59:29.630
from running for
the White House this June.

59:29.632 --> 59:32.369
Amazing considering the
evidence against the mayor.

59:32.371 --> 59:35.609
But after the main witness for
the prosecution went missing,

59:35.611 --> 59:39.783
there was no other verdict
to be given, but innocent.

59:39.785 --> 59:41.888
This is Chelsea Reese
for CNB News

59:41.890 --> 59:43.861
at the Supreme Court
in New York.

59:47.869 --> 59:49.637
As I
watched the mayor come home,

59:49.639 --> 59:52.910
I knew it was time to pounce.

59:52.912 --> 59:56.250
As he was the only person

59:56.252 --> 59:58.825
that knew where
William Bard was hiding.

01:00:05.537 --> 01:00:07.505
I've been waiting
for you McMillian!

01:00:27.446 --> 01:00:29.216
- Where is he, man?
- Who?

01:00:29.218 --> 01:00:32.054
That fucker, The Bard!

01:00:32.056 --> 01:00:34.961
You'll never catch him!
I'll never tell you where he is!

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:37.365
I'll turn your
face into a colander!

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.869
Fucking!

01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:41.072
You can't hurt me
as much as he can!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.883
We'll see!

01:01:14.374 --> 01:01:17.879
Listen.

01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:21.590
Let me explain something to you
about that wire in your mouth.

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:25.597
It's hooked up to those
charges back there.

01:01:27.399 --> 01:01:30.606
And if you don't tell me
what I want to know,

01:01:30.608 --> 01:01:32.909
I'm gonna leave you here.

01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:36.415
And sooner or later, your
jaw's gonna get tired,

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:38.621
and it's gonna snap shut,

01:01:38.623 --> 01:01:41.292
or you're gonna try
to call out to somebody,

01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:43.364
and your jaw's
gonna snap shut.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.874
When that happens, you're
gonna set off the grenades.

01:01:48.342 --> 01:01:53.487
And that missile is
headed in a bad direction.

01:01:55.155 --> 01:01:58.761
You understand?

01:01:58.763 --> 01:02:02.068
Yeah? All right.

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:06.944
So, where is that
son of a bitch?

01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:09.683
- Mm! Mm-mm.
- You're not gonna tell me?

01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:11.789
You sure?
Absolutely sure?

01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:17.533
Whew, you better think
twice about that.

01:02:17.535 --> 01:02:20.007
Mm, mnh-mnh.

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.978
I guess I'll have to go,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.285
find somebody who'll
tell me what I want to know.

01:02:30.894 --> 01:02:32.963
Oh, by the way,

01:02:32.965 --> 01:02:35.134
if you think that
you're just gonna wait

01:02:35.136 --> 01:02:37.471
until somebody
comes to save you...

01:02:37.473 --> 01:02:40.077
well, that ain't
gonna happen either.

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:42.048
You see that little
candle over there?

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.684
Mmm...

01:02:43.686 --> 01:02:47.828
In about three minutes,
you're all done anyway.

01:02:49.998 --> 01:02:50.900
Mayor.

01:02:53.974 --> 01:02:57.413
Oh my goodness,
what a way to go.

01:03:02.925 --> 01:03:03.860
Mind if I have this?

01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:10.004
Oh, ,
that's kind of nifty.

01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:11.944
I love weapons.

01:03:17.722 --> 01:03:18.958
Adios.

01:03:26.105 --> 01:03:28.842
You bastard!

01:03:42.036 --> 01:03:46.446
Now that's what I call
a star spangled banner.

01:03:55.997 --> 01:03:59.067
New York at
night is like a beautiful gift,

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:02.175
all lit up like a
Christmas tree in December.

01:04:02.177 --> 01:04:04.311
Unless you're looking
for that someone

01:04:04.313 --> 01:04:05.982
who doesn't want to be found.

01:04:05.984 --> 01:04:08.053
Then you have to shift
through the filth

01:04:08.055 --> 01:04:09.557
to find what you need.

01:04:09.559 --> 01:04:11.660
That was Little Odessa,

01:04:11.662 --> 01:04:15.301
once a home for immigrant families
looking for a safe place to live.

01:04:15.303 --> 01:04:19.008
Now it's home for one
defrosted billionaire

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.278
by the name of William Bard,

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.257
who is trying to escape
the long arm of the law.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:33.103
As I searched the city
for William Bard's men,

01:04:33.105 --> 01:04:34.942
who were all but dead.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.820
I feel proud of
what I've achieved.

01:04:41.822 --> 01:04:43.591
To the point where I've
realized maybe it's time

01:04:43.593 --> 01:04:46.931
to hang up my hat and coat,

01:04:46.933 --> 01:04:50.538
become a normal person again,
stop being a vigilante.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.845
Maybe have a normal
life with picket fences,

01:04:53.847 --> 01:04:55.179
two kids,

01:04:55.181 --> 01:04:58.021
where I read the kids bedtime
stories before they go to bed.

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:04.566
Unfortunately,
life isn't like that.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:06.303
It's too late to go
back to the police force

01:05:06.305 --> 01:05:08.343
after my time in the sewer.

01:05:10.947 --> 01:05:13.985
Killing all the rats that
worked for William Bard.

01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:16.356
I think Tenison was right,

01:05:16.358 --> 01:05:20.130
it would be good to go out to dinner
with someone of the opposite sex,

01:05:20.132 --> 01:05:22.234
relax like a normal person,

01:05:22.236 --> 01:05:25.709
maybe get drunk and fool around a
little as the night comes to a close.

01:05:25.711 --> 01:05:29.148
For fighting crime
isn't all it's made out to be.

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.253
Bruises aren't just
on the outside,

01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:33.993
but inside as well.

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:39.670
But when I think of all
the pain and suffering

01:05:39.672 --> 01:05:42.074
that William Bard
has caused...

01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:44.579
So as the sunshine comes up,

01:05:44.581 --> 01:05:48.188
I drive through the countryside
without smog and filth.

01:05:49.257 --> 01:05:51.863
The time has come
to stop and slow down...

01:05:53.031 --> 01:05:54.935
enjoy the fresh air.

01:06:01.116 --> 01:06:06.116
