Backstory.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.890
Back. S-tori.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.720
Backstory.

00:20.390 --> 00:22.500
Why did you keep saying backstory?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.900
Excellent question!

00:24.040 --> 00:26.340
When it comes to television
shows and Hollywood movies,

00:26.370 --> 00:29.140
most of the writing is terrible.

00:29.180 --> 00:33.810
- Hey, that's true.
- Don't we know it.

00:33.850 --> 00:37.120
So, good actors must make up
their own "backstory"...

00:37.160 --> 00:38.970
A history for the character.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.200
Who is this person I'm playing?
Where did I come from?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.480
What is this stain?

00:45.620 --> 00:46.680
Ooo, the police found.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
A weird stain on the seat
of my brother's car.

00:50.570 --> 00:53.230
Uh. What kinda stain?

00:53.260 --> 00:54.320
They don't know yet.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.490
They're taking the car seat
down to "the lab".

00:59.210 --> 01:01.870
Maybe we should just talk about backstory.

01:01.910 --> 01:06.240
All right, let's take a look
at this performance by me.

01:06.270 --> 01:09.910
From an old tv show
called "city bus nights"...

01:11.700 --> 01:17.400
There I am, guest starring as
the character of "loogie".

01:17.440 --> 01:19.330
So for my backstory...

01:19.650 --> 01:22.480
- Hi, sorry to interrupt!
- What is it, boy?!

01:23.000 --> 01:26.470
Mason Thornesmith is having a
major press conference right now.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.580
About the platinum music awards.

01:31.330 --> 01:33.730
I got it... they're
streaming it on The Slap.

01:33.770 --> 01:36.060
- Put it on the tv!
- Bring it on.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.200
Okay.
Now, let's see...

01:39.230 --> 01:44.330
- W... w... w...
- Move!

01:44.360 --> 01:46.900
...Last year,
the platinum music awards.

01:46.930 --> 01:52.330
Were watched by over two hundred
million people, worldwide.

01:52.370 --> 01:56.070
And this year,
I am very excited to announce.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.170
That we will begin
the platinum music awards.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.170
With a performance by a complete unknown.

02:04.340 --> 02:05.470
Is everyone watching?!

02:05.510 --> 02:08.639
Is everyone watching
the press conference?! Okay!

02:08.669 --> 02:12.870
Beginning now, we are
conducting a worldwide search.

02:12.910 --> 02:17.340
For a fresh young talent who will begin
the award show with an original song...

02:17.380 --> 02:22.180
And become an overnight music sensation.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.010
Now, please hold your questions.

02:25.050 --> 02:27.010
Please hold your questions, thank you.

02:27.050 --> 02:29.350
So for the next
forty-eight hours,

02:29.380 --> 02:36.680
we'll be accepting online video
auditions at "superstar bam" dot com.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.380
Yes! Yes!
I so got this!

02:39.420 --> 02:40.850
Shut up!

02:40.890 --> 02:43.590
So... all you young
performers out there.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.950
Who feel you have superstar potential...

02:46.990 --> 02:49.090
Show us what you've got.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.860
- That's amazing.
- That's good.

02:51.890 --> 02:59.060
Alright, alright, settle
down, cool your jets, sit.

03:00.300 --> 03:05.200
You can all work on your platinum
music award auditions later, alright?

03:05.240 --> 03:06.270
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.900
- Alright.
- Sure.

03:07.940 --> 03:11.310
Now.
I was talking about backstory.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.810
Now, when I played "loogie"...

03:12.840 --> 03:16.910
I made a list of character traits
for each letter of the name.

03:16.940 --> 03:22.880
So, for l...
I was... lonely.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.100
So then I thought I would be...

03:31.120 --> 03:32.730
Class dismissed.

Yes!!! Oh my gosh yes yes!!!

10:02.670 --> 10:06.090
- What's that on her face?

All right, cut!

10:08.110 --> 10:09.410
Let's get another take, shall we?

Wait a minute, didn't you two
girls send in auditions?

11:23.960 --> 11:27.790
Yeah, mine was the one you didn't
pick because you picked Tori's.

11:27.830 --> 11:33.760
- Ho ho, we got a brassy one here.
- Yeah, I got a lotta brass.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.080
Mine was also one you didn't pick!

11:37.240 --> 11:42.540

- Hey, I'm here. Sorry.

11:42.580 --> 11:43.570
Where were you?

11:43.610 --> 11:45.010
Well, when I was in the men's room,

11:45.040 --> 11:48.650
I opened one of the stall doors.
... and sittin' right there... Bruno Mars.

11:48.680 --> 11:49.350
What?

11:49.380 --> 11:53.220
So I was all, "oh my God, Bruno
Mars, you're like one of my idols"...

11:53.250 --> 11:58.020
And then he says, "thanks, but I'm on the toilet.
Could ya shut the door?"

11:58.060 --> 11:59.920
So I say, "sure" and I shut the door...

11:59.960 --> 12:01.630
And then Bruno Mars says,

12:01.660 --> 12:06.830
"I meant, "could you leave the
stall and then shut the door?"

12:06.870 --> 12:09.370
And I'm like, "bro, I know you're
famous, but can ya just like...

12:09.400 --> 12:13.510
Hey, hey...
Maybe stop talking.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.510
So listen, why don't you all 
come in, sit down, sit down.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.580
- Oh, thank you.
- I will.

12:17.610 --> 12:21.450
- Thank you.
- Now, Tori...

12:21.480 --> 12:23.750
Are you ready to sing the opening number.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.620
On this year's platinum music awards?

12:25.650 --> 12:26.550
Well sure.

12:26.590 --> 12:29.390
I mean, but I'm also pretty nervous.

12:29.420 --> 12:31.890
- Have some bibble.
- What?

12:31.930 --> 12:34.090
- What's bibble?
- It's a British snack.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.430
You've never had bibble?
Oh, that's a bloody crime!

12:37.470 --> 12:38.720
I don't understand it.

12:40.470 --> 12:41.940
Well, have some bibble now.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.110
There's some bibble,
and there, and there, and there.

12:44.140 --> 12:46.110
- All right, I'll have a taste.
- Okay.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.110
- I'm on a diet, but okay.
- Uh-huh?

12:50.150 --> 12:52.110
- Mmmm...
- Oh, yeah.

12:52.150 --> 12:56.420
- Really good mouth feel...
- I like it...

12:56.450 --> 12:59.120
Tell ya what:
Marshall, why don't you take 'em.

12:59.160 --> 13:04.430
All down to Barney's bibblery, get each
of them a 10-pound sack of bibble.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.930
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- That's a lot of.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.890
- 10 pounds?
- No, that's cool.

13:06.930 --> 13:08.400
No, no, no.
I insist... my treat.

13:08.430 --> 13:12.300
- Take the limo.
- Zeen?!

13:12.330 --> 13:15.070
Indeed. Go on, off ya go.
Come on.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.240
- Thank you, Mason.
-... bibbie.

13:16.270 --> 13:19.970
Wow, it's very generous.

13:20.010 --> 13:22.610
Oh Tori, Tori, not you...

13:22.640 --> 13:25.580
We have some talking to do.
Sit.

13:25.610 --> 13:28.390
Oh. Okay I'll sit.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.930
Your dream of being a pop
superstar is coming true.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.260
It is going to happen to you.

13:42.300 --> 13:46.230
Because I am gonna make it
happen. To you.

13:46.270 --> 13:50.770
Wow, cool.
So what song should I sing?

13:50.810 --> 13:54.210
- I couldn't care less.
- Oh, great. Wait, what?

13:55.140 --> 13:58.010
You see, all of this...
It's all about you.

13:58.050 --> 14:04.750
Well, that is, it's about me re-creating
you into something wonderful.

14:04.790 --> 14:08.620
- You wanna re-create me?
- Are you thirsty?

14:08.660 --> 14:11.590
Did my bibble make you thirsty?
Yeah a little.

14:11.630 --> 14:13.250
Yeah? Gwynneth.

14:17.300 --> 14:21.100
Oh, thanks. What is this?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.800
That is citrus flavored juice,

14:22.840 --> 14:25.140
made by my grandmum... mimsy.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.840
She sent it all the way from London.
Have a sip.

14:27.880 --> 14:32.850
Wow, okay. Oop! Pop! Ha ha.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.960
Mmmmm. Whoa mimsy.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.360
- Good yeah?
- So good.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.400
That's not citrus juice from my mimsy.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.300
Hmm?

14:53.340 --> 14:58.440
You just drank tuna fish water.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.270
Whaaaaaat?!

14:59.310 --> 15:00.840
But you pretended to like it.

15:00.880 --> 15:05.110
Because you wanted me to like you.

15:05.150 --> 15:08.820
You hated that tuna juice,
but you put on a show.

15:08.850 --> 15:11.550
You actually juiced a tuna?!

15:11.590 --> 15:14.490
See, the audience
likes to see a personality.

15:14.530 --> 15:18.560
A character.
The music... whatever.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.960
Mason's saying that you must let
us create an image for you.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.800
- So... you wanna like,
give me a make-over?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.070
Yes.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.940
But you mustn't tell anyone
we're putting you up to this.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.140
Well, I can tell my parents
and my friends, though, right?

15:33.180 --> 15:34.840
- Oooh.
- Absolutely not.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.380
- No one. No.
- No, no, no, no. No.

15:36.410 --> 15:38.450
This is far too big...
You can't trust anyone.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.620
- Except us.
- Exactly.

15:40.650 --> 15:43.670
And we'll never tell you
anything that isn't true.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.780
Starting now.

16:03.710 --> 16:05.870
Hey.

16:15.480 --> 16:20.050
- Whoa. Tori.
- Heyyyy Cat.

16:20.090 --> 16:25.060
- Cool outfit.
- Thanks. Whatcha got there?

16:25.090 --> 16:27.060
It's my sack of bibble.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.900
It's really heavy so I put it in a wagon.

16:29.930 --> 16:32.500
And you needed to bring
all of it to school?

16:32.530 --> 16:36.660
I can't help it!
It's so good.

16:38.810 --> 16:41.310
I can't believe Mason bought you this much.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.810
This isn't even the sack he got me.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.680
- What?!
- I finished that one.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.810
I went back and bought two more sacks.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.780
I think I might have a bibble problem.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.110
- Well, it is pretty good stuff.
- Don't touch it!!!!

16:59.610 --> 17:01.020
It's my bibble.

17:14.180 --> 17:18.640
Oh I'm sorry... were we all
supposed to dress stupid today?

17:19.980 --> 17:22.550
Hey! Every student
at Hollywood arts.

17:22.589 --> 17:27.060
Should feel free to dress
as stupidly as they choose.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.160
One time for Halloween
I wore my mom's dress.

17:29.190 --> 17:31.790
And the other kids made fun of me.

17:31.830 --> 17:35.530
It wasn't Halloween...
It was a random Tuesday in July.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.960
I was experimenting!

17:39.540 --> 17:42.570
Cat.
That is a lot of bibble.

17:42.610 --> 17:45.170
Yeah, please don't look at it.
... it's all for me.

17:45.210 --> 17:46.380
Cat, don't be stingy,

17:46.410 --> 17:47.640
you just give him
a little nibble of the bibble.

17:47.680 --> 17:53.550
- Nooo!
- So, why are you dressed like that?

17:53.590 --> 17:59.090
Not that it's bad, just...
Why?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.320
Just 'cuz.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.260
Yeah, "just cuz" she thinks
she's a big star now.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.100
I don't think I'm...

18:07.130 --> 18:11.170
Look, I just thought I'd wear
something a little different today.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.040
I mean, this has nothing to do with me
singing on the platinum music awards.

18:15.070 --> 18:19.480
- Liar.
- Aw c'mon, Jade.

18:19.510 --> 18:22.780
That's not how you call Tori
a liar through cough-talk.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.450
You do it like:
Liar. Liar.

18:26.490 --> 18:27.920
C'mon, everybody try it.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.050
- Liar.
- Liar.

18:30.090 --> 18:35.060
- Liar.
- I'm not lying! Okay?

18:35.090 --> 18:40.500
Just regular ol' Tori on a regular ol' day.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.300
- So, can we please just...
- Just this way.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.770
- Tori. Tori.
- Ms. Tori, over here.

18:43.800 --> 18:49.640
Hey! Hey! You people!
Paparazzi people! Out! Get out!

18:49.680 --> 18:52.810
Whoa! It's the voice
of plankton.

18:52.850 --> 18:55.880
- No, I am not the...
- Plankton, here.

18:55.920 --> 19:01.790
I mean... "Karen, I must have "the
secret formula for the krabby patties."

19:01.820 --> 19:04.790
Nice, nice! Let's get a
shot of plankton with Tori!

19:04.820 --> 19:07.220
Oh sure sure... huh?
How about this?

19:07.260 --> 19:09.460
- Nice, right?
- Tori. Tori.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.030
Right here, Tori.

19:14.670 --> 19:17.220
Mason?
Your four o'clock is here.

19:18.940 --> 19:22.640
- Hi.
- Ah, Tori you're early... good, good.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.480
Yeah. Uh, my friend Cat said that
she really needs to talk to you.

19:26.510 --> 19:29.810
Mister Thornesmith, you know
that store, Barney's bibblery?

19:29.850 --> 19:32.980
- Mm-hmm.
- They won't sell me any more bibble.

19:33.020 --> 19:36.920
- Why not?
- They think I might have a problem.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.860
- Would you mind calling for me?
- Sure, later, all right?

19:40.890 --> 19:45.300
- Noo! I need more bibble now!
- Now, Cat.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.330
Tori and I need to have
a little word in private.

19:48.370 --> 19:53.500
So why don't you just put on
these dark sunglasses...

19:53.540 --> 19:56.010
And these headphones...

19:56.040 --> 20:01.550
- But I don't understand.
- Just listen to this very loud music,

20:01.580 --> 20:06.220
dance around a while...
And I'll give you some bibble.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.780
But I don't see why...
Ooooo!

20:09.790 --> 20:10.760
Now Tori...

20:10.790 --> 20:15.660
You are doing a magnificent job
with the makeup and these outfits.

20:15.700 --> 20:23.100
I'm ready for bibble.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.600
You really think I need to change who I am,

20:25.640 --> 20:28.870
and be outrageous,
for people to like my music?

20:28.910 --> 20:31.710
- Oh, absolutely.
- Hundred percent.

20:31.750 --> 20:36.350
And see, we've already got you looking
the part of the outrageous pop star...

20:36.380 --> 20:39.120
...And now you've got
to play the part.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.990
- I... don't...
- Rebellious.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.350
- Dangerous.
- Yeah.

20:42.390 --> 20:45.530
The sort of wild girl who'd go to a
posh restaurant in Beverly hills,

20:45.560 --> 20:48.130
get furious with a server,
flip over a table...

20:48.160 --> 20:49.460
...Grab a plate of ravioli...

20:49.500 --> 20:53.530
... And dump that ravioli
right down a policeman's pants.

20:53.570 --> 20:56.340
I'm dancing for bibble.

20:56.370 --> 21:00.380
A policeman's pants?
Isn't that illegal?

21:00.410 --> 21:03.880
- Not a real policeman.
- No, no. A stuntman.

21:03.910 --> 21:06.150
But everyone will think it's all real.

21:06.180 --> 21:10.320
- And people will think I'm a terrible person.
- Precisely.

21:10.350 --> 21:14.610
And that will create buzz.
Get everyone talking about you.

21:15.860 --> 21:19.790
Well, can... can I at least
tell my friends that it's fake?

21:19.830 --> 21:22.260
Oh no.
No no no no no no.

21:22.300 --> 21:26.870
- Don't be a silly person.
- No one likes a silly.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.300
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna be a silly.

21:31.010 --> 21:32.610
Come on now, I'll take you upstairs...

21:32.640 --> 21:35.350
Katy Perry's up there
cutting her new track.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.010
Wow.

21:37.050 --> 21:43.120
- Wait, ravioli down his pants?
- It'll be a nice feeling.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.990
Hello?
Somebody bibble me!

22:01.270 --> 22:02.040
Water?

22:02.070 --> 22:07.340
What?! Oh. Yeah.
Water's good. Sure.

22:07.380 --> 22:11.280
Hey Tori look... it's bud
alderman... the astronaut.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.750
- Uh-huh.
- He walked on the moon!

22:13.790 --> 22:19.030
Yeah, walking is great exercise.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.430
Somethin' botherin' you?

22:21.460 --> 22:23.890
What? Nothing, why
thought you'd say that?

22:23.930 --> 22:25.330
'Cuz you seem all freaked out.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.460
I feel like I'm with my grandma.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.940
- A-ha ha ha ha ha ha.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.140
That laugh seemed insincere.

22:33.170 --> 22:37.580
Okay, we have a chopped salad
for the gentleman...

22:37.610 --> 22:40.450
Ah yeah, that's some legit salad.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.260
And for the lady...
Lobster salad with avocado.

22:53.980 --> 22:56.960
What?!
What is this?!

22:57.000 --> 23:01.270
- Uh, well you ordered the...
- Where's the manager?!

23:01.300 --> 23:03.540
- Tori, maybe you...
- Stay outta this!

23:03.570 --> 23:05.440
Well.

23:05.470 --> 23:07.670
Ma'am, if you would rather
have something else I'd be...

23:07.710 --> 23:08.770
No!

23:08.810 --> 23:14.450
What I'd rather do is see you get fired
for being an incompetent pre-turd!

23:14.480 --> 23:20.490
Check please.
My salad!

23:20.520 --> 23:22.920
- Excuse me, young lady.
- Give me that ravioli!

23:22.960 --> 23:24.660
There's no need
to be this upset over some...

23:24.690 --> 23:26.230
Oh my stars!!!

23:26.260 --> 23:31.660
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

23:31.700 --> 23:34.630
That wasn't the cop!
Where's the stunt cop?!

23:34.670 --> 23:36.940
No, no, no, no. It's all right.
It's all right...

23:36.970 --> 23:38.600
This is so much better.

23:38.640 --> 23:45.410
- Oh.
- Is there a problem here?

23:45.450 --> 23:47.380
I think there is.

23:47.580 --> 23:56.980
Sync by BeanBaro

www.Addic7ed.com

23:57.140 --> 23:58.410
Hurry, let's see it!

23:58.450 --> 24:01.510
I don't know about this.
What if Tori walks in?

24:01.550 --> 24:02.880
I wouldn't worry about that.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.750
She's been skippin' classes all week.

24:04.790 --> 24:07.480
Yeah, 'cuz she thinks she's hot whiz.

24:08.520 --> 24:12.160
- Sikowitz, Cat has bibble!
- Cat...

24:12.190 --> 24:15.160
No, it's not mine,
I'm holding it for a friend!

24:15.200 --> 24:18.580
But I need it!
I mean, my friend needs it!

24:19.200 --> 24:22.870
- Cat, here...
- What's this?

24:22.900 --> 24:23.870
It's a special gum.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.040
If you're cravin' bibble,
just chew some of that.

24:26.070 --> 24:27.510
It'll make you feel better.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.310
- See, just unwrap it, and then...
- I know how gum works!

24:31.340 --> 24:35.310
Okay, here we go...

24:35.350 --> 24:36.780
Excuse me, young lady.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.350
There's no need to be this upset
over some...

24:39.390 --> 24:44.750
Oh my stars!!!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

24:47.860 --> 24:52.230
That is disappointing and shocking.

24:52.270 --> 24:54.500
It's disashocking.

24:54.540 --> 24:59.040
And hilarious.
It's disashockinglarious.

24:59.070 --> 25:03.330
Yeah, Tori has a big problem.

25:05.050 --> 25:08.580
I can't believe the whole "being famous"
thing has already gone to her head.

25:08.620 --> 25:12.380
I just think she's probably
caught up in some sort of...

25:12.930 --> 25:21.530
...And so in 1827, the television
was invented by... t.V. Smith...

25:21.560 --> 25:25.160
And that's why this television
is here right now,

25:25.200 --> 25:27.000
there's no other reason,
we certainly weren't watching.

25:27.030 --> 25:30.300
Okay. I know you guys were watching
that video of me at the restaurant.

25:30.340 --> 25:34.040
- You were literally, like,
t.V. Smith-conceited.

25:34.070 --> 25:36.570
Can we please just forget about it?

25:36.610 --> 25:39.610
- Good luck.
- It's the number one video on splashface.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.180
Yup. So the whole world knows
what you're turning into.

25:43.210 --> 25:46.710
- I'm not turning... it's just...
- Just what?

25:49.660 --> 25:51.390
Complicated.

25:51.420 --> 25:55.130
So you deny that you've totally
changed how you dress?

25:55.160 --> 25:55.890
No, but...

25:55.930 --> 25:58.030
Do you deny throwing a
tantrum in that restaurant?

25:58.060 --> 26:02.500
- No, I did, but... but...
- But but but.

26:02.540 --> 26:07.470
Looks like someone's got
a bad case of the buts.

26:07.510 --> 26:10.810
Maybe she should see a butt doctor.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.250
I got a guy.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.580
Uh, Cat, maybe you wanna
back off that bibble gum...

26:15.620 --> 26:17.480
Don't tell me what to do!

26:19.550 --> 26:21.150
Andre...

26:21.190 --> 26:23.160
You were at the restaurant with Tori.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.820
What's your take on what happened?

26:24.860 --> 26:28.530
Well, when the server brought
her salad, Tori didn't like it,

26:28.560 --> 26:30.830
and y'know... words were said...
Tables were flipped...

26:31.130 --> 26:34.610
And a great man who walked on the
moon got ravioli in his pants.

26:35.310 --> 26:39.660
- But that's not fair!
- How's the truth not fair?

26:44.480 --> 26:47.310
Wait, but...

26:49.980 --> 26:51.320
Cat...

26:53.150 --> 26:57.360
You don't think I'm obnoxious
and awful, do you?

27:05.370 --> 27:08.100
You've got to take that gum
out of your mouth.

27:15.410 --> 27:18.850
Byeeeeee.

27:19.090 --> 27:21.180
I deserve this.

27:34.530 --> 27:38.770
- What is that?
- A bowl of mayonnaise.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.640
For what?

27:41.670 --> 27:44.340
I read online that soaking
your face in mayonnaise.

27:44.370 --> 27:46.300
For ten minutes a day
makes a girl prettier.

27:49.610 --> 27:54.370
- Tori, it's Beck.
- Beck! Oh.

27:57.820 --> 28:02.350
Oh hey, Beck... I didn't know
you were coming over.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.970
- You got a little somethin'...
- I'll be right back!

28:14.540 --> 28:17.310
Y'know... for a girl
who's about to open.

28:17.340 --> 28:21.410
The platinum music awards in
front of like a billion people,

28:21.450 --> 28:23.910
you don't look too happy.

28:23.950 --> 28:27.310
- I'm not.
- Why?

28:28.790 --> 28:32.610
'Cuz I don't wanna be...

28:33.430 --> 28:37.510
'Cuz I just wish
that I could tell everyone...

28:39.100 --> 28:41.230
...That it's all an act?

28:41.270 --> 28:44.350
That those people are making
you dress and act like a jerk?

28:44.550 --> 28:47.320
- How did you know?!
- 'Cuz you're Tori.

28:47.950 --> 28:51.050
You wouldn't act like that
unless someone was making you.

28:51.680 --> 28:56.020
Oh my God, you have no idea how
happy I am that you know the truth.

28:56.220 --> 29:00.050
But I didn't tell you!
I never told you I was faking...

29:00.090 --> 29:02.570
- You guessed it!
- Okay.

29:03.390 --> 29:05.690
Now why don't you just stop?

29:05.730 --> 29:09.800
'Cuz if I don't keep acting like
a "bad girl obnoxious rock star"

29:09.830 --> 29:11.700
they might drop me from the show.

29:11.730 --> 29:15.050
The show is in two days.
They can't fire you.

29:15.470 --> 29:18.480
I don't know. I'm scared.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.240
Listen...

29:21.280 --> 29:22.680
Just tell Mason Thornesmith.

29:22.710 --> 29:25.080
That you're not gonna play
his little game anymore.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.140
- But...
- The world needs to see who you really are.

29:31.450 --> 29:32.440
'Cuz you're awesome.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.330
- Oh.
- Oh.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.930
- Who wants pie?
- Hi.

29:44.970 --> 29:47.850
- I gotta go.
- Okay, later.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.730
What... I don't get it,
what are you doin'?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.550
Just giving you a hand massage.

30:03.590 --> 30:04.920
Well, stop it.

30:11.460 --> 30:14.360
- Uh, hello.
- Hey, Cat.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.000
- Hiii.
- Uh, who's the dude?

30:17.030 --> 30:19.070
Oh. This is oliver.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.960
My parents hired him
to keep me away from bibble.

30:23.110 --> 30:28.040
- So he's your bibble guard?
- That's right.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.740
I used to have a bibble problem myself.

30:30.780 --> 30:32.210
And now I help others.

30:32.250 --> 30:34.610
Can't I just have a little bibble?

30:34.650 --> 30:36.880
No, baby. You can't.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.980
Oh, she can have a little bit.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.250
Here, Cat...
Here's a bibble to tide you over.

30:41.290 --> 30:44.720
Oh.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.590
- No bibble for Cat.
- No bibble for Cat.

30:52.270 --> 30:54.550
You shoulda tried to massage his hand.

30:58.570 --> 31:00.410
Stop acting so nervous.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.240
I'm not acting, I'm super nervous.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.440
Stop.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.510
Mason's gonna be here any second
with his dumb camera crew.

31:07.550 --> 31:10.920
To get video of me slapping a delivery man.

31:10.950 --> 31:13.050
Okay, then you'll just
explain to Mason that...

31:13.090 --> 31:17.190
Tori!

31:17.220 --> 31:21.090
- Tori...
- Hey, Mason.

31:21.130 --> 31:24.330
- Hey, what?
Why are you dressed like a pre-turd?

31:25.730 --> 31:30.070
Did you send her the jellyfish
dress... with the tentacles?

31:30.110 --> 31:33.410
- I did! I swear it!
- Where's the dress?!

31:33.440 --> 31:35.410
And why aren't you wearing the meat hat?

31:35.450 --> 31:36.810
Did you send her the meat hat?

31:36.850 --> 31:39.750
Yes!
I... I cross me heart!

31:39.780 --> 31:45.420
Tori doesn't wanna wear your
jellyfish dress or your meat hat.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.420
Listen to me, young lady.
We have a deal.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.230
Look, I don't wanna be your puppet anymore!

31:51.260 --> 31:53.230
I don't wanna wear stupid clothes,

31:53.260 --> 31:54.160
and stupid makeup,

31:54.200 --> 31:55.900
and I don't wanna be mean.

31:55.930 --> 32:00.690
Or flip tables or dump ravioli
down former astronauts' pants!

32:02.110 --> 32:04.910
- You forgot one.
- What?

32:04.940 --> 32:07.610
You're also not going to sing
on the platinum music awards.

32:07.640 --> 32:08.840
You're out.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.510
- They're tomorrow night.
- I'm aware.

32:13.550 --> 32:14.380
Beck...?!

32:14.420 --> 32:16.850
"Sir", you're not gonna be able
to replace Tori that fast.

32:16.890 --> 32:21.850
- Ho-ho, won't I?
- Oh, yeah. You.

32:23.390 --> 32:24.490
Who, me?

32:24.530 --> 32:28.530
You gave a rather
fantastic audition as I recall.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.830
Thanks.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.330
How would you like to sing
the opening number.

32:32.370 --> 32:36.900
Tomorrow night
at the platinum music awards?

32:36.940 --> 32:40.340
- No way.
- Absolutely.

32:40.910 --> 32:44.470
Come then.
We have much to discuss.

32:50.350 --> 32:51.290
See?!

33:00.810 --> 33:04.550
I mean, obviously, I'm sad
I'm not gonna be on the show,

33:05.550 --> 33:09.290
but I'm kinda proud that I
stood up for myself and...

33:12.960 --> 33:16.020
Is that really helping anything?

33:16.060 --> 33:18.960
They say mustard retards pimples.

33:30.870 --> 33:33.640
Oh God, people.

33:41.780 --> 33:44.830
- Hey.
- Hey. I brought you a present.

33:48.010 --> 33:52.910
- A stuffed dog?
- A special stuffed dog. Check him out.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.280
That's truly frightening.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.670
Yeah, that's a sick toy, isn't it?

34:09.139 --> 34:11.530
Ulch. One sec.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.920
Hello boys. Come in.

34:16.949 --> 34:19.750
Thanks.
I brought you a plant.

34:19.790 --> 34:22.489
I brought you
a little chocolate leaf blower.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.429
- That's chocolate?
- Yeah, taste it!

34:24.500 --> 34:25.770
No!

34:27.090 --> 34:29.860
You guys. Listen.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.300
I really appreciate you coming
over here to try and cheer me up.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.230
But I'm fine.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.139
Sorry. I'm not too sure
how this puppy works...

34:42.179 --> 34:46.050
- Turn it off!
- Right. Uh.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.210
I got it.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.150
Hey.
Cat wants to video chat you.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.860
- Hiiiiii!
- Hey, cutie.

35:01.910 --> 35:02.980
- Hi, Cat.
- Hey, girl.

35:03.120 --> 35:07.310
- You remember oliver.
- Hi everyone.

35:07.910 --> 35:12.500
- Cat... where are you?
- Uhhh...

35:13.690 --> 35:20.480
I'm in the bathtub.
La lala lala lala...

35:20.520 --> 35:22.880
You're not in the bathtub!

35:22.920 --> 35:25.620
We're backstage at the Boomerang theater.

35:25.730 --> 35:28.160
Cat, you don't have to lie.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.160
It's okay if you're with Jade
helping her get ready.

35:30.190 --> 35:33.140
- For the show tomorrow night.
- You're sure you're not mad at me?

35:33.530 --> 35:38.470
- I'm sure.
- Good. Bring me some bibble.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.770
- You're my only Hope.
- No bibble!

35:41.810 --> 35:44.040
Oliverrrrrrr!

35:44.080 --> 35:46.580
Cat, I'm not getting you bibble.

35:46.610 --> 35:50.280
- Anything else?
- No. Oh!

35:50.300 --> 35:53.160
Jade said you guys are invited to
come here and watch her rehearse.

35:54.550 --> 35:59.260
Ah, no thanks.
You guys wanna go watch her?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.790
Rehearse for the platinum music awards?

36:01.830 --> 36:03.360
- Noooo.
- Oh, no.

36:03.390 --> 36:07.360
- Nuh-uh.
We came here to hang with you.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.070
- If you wanna go you can go.
- Thanks!

36:10.100 --> 36:12.570
Yay!

36:12.600 --> 36:14.690
Wait, you left your dog in the freezer!

36:15.770 --> 36:18.750
You're taking my chocolate leaf blower?!

36:25.620 --> 36:27.350
Can't I just have one handful?

36:27.380 --> 36:29.420
- The answer is no.
- But I just...

36:29.450 --> 36:31.690
- Cat.
- Oh hey.

36:31.720 --> 36:35.120
Take this. Now Mason wants
me to try on the blue skirt.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.460
- Why, he doesn't like this one?
- I think this skirt is pretty.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.700
Just go get the blue one.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.430
Come on, oliver.

36:43.470 --> 36:44.900
First we had to get the red skirt,

36:44.940 --> 36:46.400
now we gotta go get the blue skirt...

36:46.440 --> 36:48.370
Life is hard.

36:48.410 --> 36:50.640
I shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.940
No, you were right.

36:52.980 --> 36:54.380
I mean, if I'm gonna be successful,

36:54.410 --> 36:56.180
I want it to be 'cuz of my talent,

36:56.210 --> 37:00.280
not for throwing tantrums
and wearing meat hats.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.910
Well... can't you be famous for
your music and wear a meat hat?

37:05.520 --> 37:08.020
Seriously, meat whenever you want.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.630
Just... right out of your hat.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.490
- Right out of my hat?
- Right out of your hat. Into your mouth.

37:13.530 --> 37:17.670
- What's that?
- So...

37:19.240 --> 37:20.490
Yeah...?

37:23.910 --> 37:30.400
Uhhh... oh...
You...

37:32.250 --> 37:35.350
- I'm sorry...
- No, I'm sorry, I...

37:35.390 --> 37:40.190
- I didn't mean to...
- No no, you didn't... you...

37:40.230 --> 37:47.230
- Then why can't we kiss?
- 'Cuz. 'Cuz of Jade.

37:47.270 --> 37:48.930
Jade and I broke up.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.530
- Yeah, but... kissing
your friend's ex-boyfriend...

37:51.570 --> 37:55.040
Wait. Wait, wait... since
when are you and Jade friends?

37:55.070 --> 37:57.370
Last week she took your hamburger.

37:57.410 --> 37:59.700
She just rubbed it against her bare foot.

38:00.780 --> 38:04.840
What?! I ate feet meat?!

38:06.250 --> 38:10.330
And she took your spot
on the platinum music awards.

38:11.020 --> 38:16.430
Look, I mean, I guess Jade and I
aren't really "friends" friends...

38:16.460 --> 38:20.460
But we're kinda friends...
I think...

38:20.500 --> 38:24.030
And kissing her ex-boyfriend...

38:26.180 --> 38:28.310
I can't do that to a friend.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.760
- We're back.
- We got the blue skirt!

38:42.620 --> 38:44.860
Check one.
Check, check one.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.960
The platinum music awards.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.230
Twelve minutes away, people.
Going live in twelve.

38:50.270 --> 38:52.600
What don't you understand?

38:52.630 --> 38:55.940
Why can't you just let me
smell some bibble?

38:55.970 --> 38:58.300
You can't even have a whiff of bibble.

38:58.340 --> 39:01.770
It's too sweet.
It's too good.

39:03.480 --> 39:07.020
- Hey, what's up Cat?
- Hey, little red thing.

39:07.850 --> 39:09.920
- Hiiii.
- So where's Jade?

39:09.950 --> 39:12.840
You can't talk to her,
she's over there getting ready.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.560
C'mon everyone.
I'll take you to our seats.

39:17.590 --> 39:20.730
- I get the aisle seat.
- You can have the aisle seat. For bibble!

39:20.760 --> 39:23.930
- No!
- Dang it!

39:23.960 --> 39:27.200
I'm gonna go get some safety
pins for you to hold that down.

39:27.310 --> 39:28.670
Thanks.

39:44.580 --> 39:50.160
- Wow... incredible outfit.
- I look like an idiot.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.170
A... pretty pink idiot...

39:56.530 --> 39:59.530
With a...Thing on her head.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.100
Thanks.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.530
Didn't expect to see you here.

40:06.140 --> 40:10.760
Well... everyone else was
coming to cheer you on, so...

40:11.610 --> 40:13.910
Figured I would, too.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.150
And...

40:15.180 --> 40:17.990
You look way better in that
than I would have.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.860
This isn't right.

40:22.890 --> 40:27.230
