WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:08.246
Oh, yeah.

00:11.093 --> 00:13.465
Oh, my God.

00:19.226 --> 00:21.183
Oh, yeah.

00:22.813 --> 00:24.936
Cheers to you, babe.

00:31.821 --> 00:33.481
Look at that.

00:45.292 --> 00:46.548
You're beautiful.

00:46.572 --> 00:48.791
- Grrr!
- Oh!

00:49.629 --> 00:51.539
Grrr!

00:53.800 --> 00:55.508
Two more?

00:55.760 --> 00:57.420
You got it.

01:13.151 --> 01:14.503
- I want to see you.
- Hey, hey.

01:14.527 --> 01:15.702
Bad etiquette, homes.

01:15.726 --> 01:18.667
- You can't be touching the dancers.
- Hey, look, guys.

01:18.691 --> 01:21.083
- We don't want any problems.
- I got no problems.

01:21.107 --> 01:23.466
- You got a problem?
- All right. All right.

01:23.490 --> 01:25.511
Settle down
and take it outside, boys.

01:25.535 --> 01:28.030
We got a zero tolerance
for trouble in here.

01:35.798 --> 01:36.960
How about a dance?

01:38.175 --> 01:40.500
I'm done for tonight. Sorry.

01:47.058 --> 01:49.929
Dude, where's the beers?
The natives are getting restless.

01:53.231 --> 01:55.638
- Where you going?
- I think I'm in love.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.657
Hey.

01:57.681 --> 01:59.354
You wanna grab a coffee
or something?

02:00.362 --> 02:02.082
- It's late.
- Decaf?

02:02.106 --> 02:03.858
Listen...

02:04.366 --> 02:05.908
Look out.

02:47.990 --> 02:51.299
I already sent the others upstairs.

02:51.323 --> 02:52.714
Good morning, Hetty.

02:52.738 --> 02:56.090
Well, that's a matter of perspective,
Mr. Callen.

02:56.114 --> 02:57.925
I've been doing some accounting

02:57.949 --> 03:00.852
and I came across an anomaly
in your expenses.

03:00.876 --> 03:05.349
This is a $1,400 restaurant bill
from Matsuhisa.

03:05.373 --> 03:07.018
That's from the Miyagomi case.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.473
You mean it's not a mistake?

03:08.497 --> 03:11.855
- You spent $1,400 on raw fish?
- Not me.

03:11.879 --> 03:15.446
- My alias, Tony Z did.
- Ah.

03:15.470 --> 03:18.286
And is Tony Z
going to reimburse me?

03:18.310 --> 03:20.991
- You'll have to talk to him about that.
- Aha.

03:21.015 --> 03:23.619
Hetty, when I go undercover
as a beach bum,

03:23.643 --> 03:25.166
I eat at the Kogi truck.

03:25.190 --> 03:28.252
When I'm going after high rollers,
I gotta hit it a little harder.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.686
Try ordering soup, player.

03:32.031 --> 03:33.632
I'll tell Tony that.

03:33.656 --> 03:35.983
You do that.

03:42.249 --> 03:43.340
So, what are we looking at?

03:43.364 --> 03:46.223
This footage is from a gentlemen's
club in Hollywood.

03:46.247 --> 03:48.684
That's Petty Officer Mostel Renny.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.857
The driver of the car
and PO Renny were killed.

03:51.881 --> 03:53.271
The woman's in the hospital.

03:53.295 --> 03:55.899
It's tragic, but since when
do we start investigating DUIs?

03:55.923 --> 03:59.440
Well, Renny was there last night
with several other sailors,

03:59.464 --> 04:01.988
all of whom
are Crypto Language Technicians.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.912
Basically,
the Navy's top secret geek squad.

04:04.936 --> 04:07.037
Any surveillance footage
from inside the club?

04:07.061 --> 04:10.350
- No.
- Oh, look, pervs don't like to be filmed.

04:10.567 --> 04:11.872
Meow.

04:11.896 --> 04:14.500
The driver of the car
was African American. Had no ID.

04:14.524 --> 04:16.499
Right, probably left
his wallet at home.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.084
The car was stolen weeks ago.

04:18.108 --> 04:20.298
Yeah, it might be a coincidence.

04:20.322 --> 04:21.880
Maybe not.

04:21.904 --> 04:26.325
I contacted the hospital. The young
lady is well enough for questioning.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.936
Sam, why don't you and Kensi
take the accident scene?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.520
Crime scene.

04:31.544 --> 04:34.013
Dom, find Renny's friends,
see if they know anything.

04:34.037 --> 04:35.732
Can I get the address
for the hospital?

04:35.756 --> 04:38.984
Hollywood Presbyterian on Vermont.
Take Sunset.

04:39.008 --> 04:41.561
And I'll need anything
you can find out about the girl.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.222
She's Ukrainian.

04:45.016 --> 04:46.724
Thank you.

04:51.272 --> 04:54.273
Eric, problem?

04:54.942 --> 04:56.935
Um... No.

04:59.571 --> 05:02.145
Okay, we've got rubber in the street.

05:02.366 --> 05:03.836
Yeah, no skid marks.

05:03.860 --> 05:06.110
Which means the driver
didn't even try to stop.

05:09.706 --> 05:11.093
And that parking lot is too small.

05:11.117 --> 05:14.624
There's no way to accelerate that fast
in this distance.

05:15.169 --> 05:19.795
So the driver probably left the lot,
turned around, accelerated back.

05:20.883 --> 05:22.021
Which means...

05:22.045 --> 05:24.340
Means Hetty's right.

05:24.803 --> 05:26.712
It's a crime scene.

05:30.142 --> 05:31.280
Katya Vitkoya?

05:31.304 --> 05:32.615
Yes?

05:32.639 --> 05:34.353
Hi, my name's Callen.

05:34.979 --> 05:36.366
I already spoke to the police.

05:36.390 --> 05:39.743
I'm not a cop. I'm with the Department
of Transport and Highway Safety.

05:39.767 --> 05:41.496
Did you know Petty Officer Renny?

05:41.520 --> 05:42.701
No.

05:42.725 --> 05:46.213
Look, maybe you could come
tomorrow. I'm sorry. I'm very tired.

05:46.237 --> 05:47.581
Really?

05:47.605 --> 05:49.467
Because they told me that you, uh...

05:49.491 --> 05:50.905
You just woke up.

05:52.913 --> 05:53.920
You from the Ukraine?

05:53.944 --> 05:55.403
- Yes.
- Where about?

05:56.082 --> 05:57.909
A small town. Pavlivka.

05:58.376 --> 06:00.665
- No one's ever heard of it.
- I know Pavlivka.

06:01.296 --> 06:04.557
Yeah, I spent some time in
Balaklavsky a few years ago.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.417
Really?

06:06.634 --> 06:09.730
Years ago, even locals
weren't allowed to Balaklavsky.

06:09.754 --> 06:12.111
Were you supposed to be there?

06:12.135 --> 06:15.426
I was working on a big pothole problem
that they were having.

06:17.895 --> 06:19.863
How long you been in the U. S?

06:19.887 --> 06:21.533
Not long.

06:21.557 --> 06:23.688
Long enough for your visa to expire?

06:25.318 --> 06:27.915
I'm applying for a student visa.

06:27.939 --> 06:29.986
You're in school?

06:30.198 --> 06:31.965
Well, I'm applying for school too.

06:31.989 --> 06:33.248
Oh, yeah?

06:33.272 --> 06:34.482
Which one?

06:38.122 --> 06:41.206
Look, I'm not from immigration.

06:42.292 --> 06:44.700
I just wanna know what happened
in that bar last night.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.564
A man in the club grabbed me.

06:48.588 --> 06:51.426
The guy who drove the car
was with him.

06:52.051 --> 06:53.308
That sailor intervened,

06:53.332 --> 06:56.322
but the club owner
and a bouncer stepped in

06:56.346 --> 06:58.423
before anything really happened.

07:05.522 --> 07:07.538
- Eric?
- Still no ID on the driver.

07:07.562 --> 07:09.666
But forensics got a hit
on a set of prints

07:09.690 --> 07:11.116
they pulled off the car window.

07:11.140 --> 07:14.498
The guy's name
is Cesar "Chi-Chi" Vargas.

07:14.522 --> 07:16.631
He's had run-ins with ICE
and the DEA

07:16.655 --> 07:21.094
for smuggling everything from drugs
to human cargo across the border.

07:21.118 --> 07:25.510
I'm sending you his photo
and arrest record now.

07:25.534 --> 07:27.012
All right, copy Sam and Kensi.

07:27.036 --> 07:29.178
See if they can get anyone
to make a positive ID.

07:29.202 --> 07:31.014
And find me a last-known address.

07:31.038 --> 07:32.328
Have them meet me there.

07:37.552 --> 07:40.008
Is this the guy
that grabbed you at the bar?

07:41.598 --> 07:43.032
- No.
- You're sure?

07:43.056 --> 07:46.474
Yes. The man was older.

07:47.687 --> 07:48.967
And scruffier.

07:50.064 --> 07:52.447
No. No, this guy was older.

07:52.471 --> 07:55.816
And he was with the African American
guy who crashed the car.

07:57.362 --> 08:00.945
- They use a credit card?
- No, I already checked. Sorry.

08:01.950 --> 08:02.957
Thanks.

08:02.981 --> 08:04.903
Yeah, of course.

08:07.622 --> 08:10.030
He knows more than he's telling us.

08:14.921 --> 08:18.124
There's an alley out back.
I'll take the front.

08:26.181 --> 08:27.188
Hello?

08:27.212 --> 08:29.513
SeÃ±or Vargas?

08:29.768 --> 08:31.594
I'm going in, Sam.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.899
Go.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.783
- Clear.
- Clear.

09:00.463 --> 09:01.767
Place is locked up.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.648
He must have been gone
for a while.

09:03.672 --> 09:06.355
It might be why it smells musty
in here.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.469
If I had a place on the beach
like this, I wouldn't go anywhere.

09:19.648 --> 09:22.684
Well, he's clearly past
his expiration date.

09:38.013 --> 09:40.196
You found this guy in a fridge?

09:40.220 --> 09:42.026
Weird.

09:42.050 --> 09:46.448
When they said NCIS was coming
with a body, I kind of expected Nate.

09:46.472 --> 09:49.292
Well, Nate was busy,
but he sends his regards.

09:49.316 --> 09:51.000
Really? Heh, heh.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.208
He's so sweet.

09:53.232 --> 09:54.873
You know, he works so much.

09:54.897 --> 09:58.463
I wish whoever was in charge there
would just cut the guy some slack.

09:58.487 --> 10:00.591
- You know?
- Ahem.

10:00.615 --> 10:01.923
Oh, right.

10:01.947 --> 10:05.713
Don't ignore the corpse.
He's still in the room. Heh, heh.

10:05.737 --> 10:09.639
Okay. It looks like he's been dead
for at least two weeks.

10:09.663 --> 10:12.183
The cold temperature
slowed the decomposition,

10:12.207 --> 10:13.979
but it certainly didn't stop it.

10:14.003 --> 10:16.900
- Cause of death?
- Best guess at this point,

10:16.924 --> 10:19.772
suffocation
following blunt-force trauma.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.356
Clean and quiet.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.013
I'll know more once I open him up.

10:23.598 --> 10:26.243
You two are welcome to stay
and wait if you'd like.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.470
I don't usually have an audience,
but visitors are always welcome.

10:31.939 --> 10:34.287
- Pretty cool, huh? Heh, heh.
- Tempting.

10:34.311 --> 10:36.083
- But we'll pass.
- Okay.

10:36.107 --> 10:38.126
Did you finish with the driver
from the club?

10:38.150 --> 10:39.790
Oh, another weird one.

10:39.814 --> 10:41.043
He wasn't drunk.

10:41.067 --> 10:44.880
In fact, he didn't have any alcohol
or drugs in his system.

10:44.904 --> 10:47.210
- Somebody called to claim the body?
- Oh, not yet.

10:47.234 --> 10:48.882
We haven't been able to ID him.

10:48.906 --> 10:51.571
Still running his prints and dental.

10:55.127 --> 10:58.081
But this might help.

11:04.302 --> 11:08.169
At first, I thought there were some sort
of gang initiation.

11:08.389 --> 11:09.824
Looks like machete wounds.

11:09.848 --> 11:13.325
Last time I saw anything like this,
I was in Rwanda.

11:13.349 --> 11:16.200
Do you guys know
if Nate is seeing anyone?

11:16.224 --> 11:21.224
Because, you know,
I'm just wondering.

11:25.364 --> 11:27.083
Renny's sailor buddies
didn't see anything.

11:27.107 --> 11:30.709
Although, one of them said Renny
was hitting on the dancer, Katya.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.638
I ran the driver's prints through
immigration's refugee database,

11:33.662 --> 11:36.926
I got a match. Deng Oyat.

11:36.950 --> 11:40.766
He's not African American.
He's African African.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.052
Originally from Sudan.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.919
He was placed with a foster family
in Toluca Lake three years ago.

11:46.175 --> 11:48.024
He's one of the Lost Boys.

11:48.048 --> 11:50.946
Second Sudanese Civil War
left 2 million dead

11:50.970 --> 11:53.652
and around 25,000 young men
displaced or orphaned.

11:53.676 --> 11:55.675
They became known
as the Lost Boys of the Sudan.

11:57.185 --> 11:59.284
Ops, Agent Vail.

11:59.308 --> 12:01.412
The lucky ones
managed to get into the U.S.

12:01.436 --> 12:04.310
And other countries
through humanitarian aid.

12:05.693 --> 12:09.525
Well, maybe his foster parents know
who he was with last night.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.001
That was Hollywood Presbyterian.

12:12.025 --> 12:14.844
Katya Vitkoya
just signed herself out.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.253
Looks like we'll be paying her
a house call, Dr. Hanna.

12:17.277 --> 12:20.657
Take Kensi.
I need to check something.

12:21.082 --> 12:22.956
You wanna share?

12:23.418 --> 12:25.457
If it pans out.

12:35.096 --> 12:37.005
Thirty-two hours.

12:38.724 --> 12:39.731
Excuse me?

12:39.755 --> 12:43.907
You had 32 hours of overtime
last week.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.989
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:46.013 --> 12:47.909
It was a busy one.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.037
Apparently you've had
a lot of busy ones.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.370
You have seven weeks

12:53.394 --> 12:57.876
- of unused vacation time owing.
- I do?

12:57.900 --> 13:01.502
Were you planning on, uh, sailing
around the world?

13:01.526 --> 13:05.997
No, just busy.
You know, working. Uh...

13:06.625 --> 13:09.471
Just, uh, a lot.

13:09.495 --> 13:13.537
Yes, we established that
back at the start of the conversation.

13:14.257 --> 13:16.142
I don't determine
the case loads, Hetty.

13:16.166 --> 13:19.687
No, but I do set the schedules.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.239
So start packing.

13:21.263 --> 13:24.633
On Monday morning,
you're on holiday for a week.

13:25.851 --> 13:28.698
Where am I supposed to go?

13:28.722 --> 13:32.062
I'm not a travel agent.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.667
- What was that about?
- I've been banished.

13:38.691 --> 13:40.571
I think something's up with Hetty.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.340
Come on, pick it up.

13:45.364 --> 13:47.588
Look here. Move back. Right there.

13:47.612 --> 13:49.591
- Watch out.
- What?

13:49.615 --> 13:51.368
- Watch out.
- Police.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.910
Go out. Come on, look here.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.997
Look here.

13:56.213 --> 13:57.873
- Moe.
- You cannot play like that.

13:58.674 --> 13:59.836
Moe. Hey, hey, hey.

14:02.844 --> 14:04.978
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

14:05.002 --> 14:07.421
- What you doing?
- Pretty quick for an old man.

14:08.183 --> 14:11.243
- It's a joke.
- Yeah, try again.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.013
Hey.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.645
What's up, man?

14:16.857 --> 14:18.684
Come on, now.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.053
Are you kidding me?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.178
How does a stripper afford
a place like this?

14:32.202 --> 14:34.673
Some of these strippers
make six figures a year.

14:34.697 --> 14:35.929
Oh, really?

14:35.953 --> 14:38.082
- So I've heard.
- Heh, heh.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.054
Going on a trip?

14:42.078 --> 14:44.628
- My sister is sick.
- You don't have a sister.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.561
And you should probably have stayed
in the hospital.

14:48.585 --> 14:50.529
Does the name Deng Oyat
mean anything to you?

14:50.553 --> 14:52.607
- No.
- He's the guy who tried to kill you

14:52.631 --> 14:54.599
and Petty Officer Renny last night.

14:55.435 --> 14:58.080
- I'm sorry. I have to go now.
- You need to answer the question.

14:58.104 --> 14:59.682
Get down!

15:26.621 --> 15:27.819
This is Nate.

15:28.832 --> 15:30.871
He's a good listener.

15:31.793 --> 15:33.536
Thank you.

15:34.128 --> 15:35.243
How you feeling?

15:35.963 --> 15:36.971
Fine.

15:36.995 --> 15:39.521
Well, that's the adrenaline pumping
through your body.

15:39.545 --> 15:42.753
And when it wears off in a little while,
you're gonna start shaking.

15:43.220 --> 15:44.904
You might feel
like you're gonna throw up.

15:44.928 --> 15:46.448
But don't worry.

15:46.472 --> 15:47.896
It's a natural reaction.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.100
You're safe here.

15:52.646 --> 15:55.825
- Who were those men at your house?
- I've never seen them before.

15:55.849 --> 15:58.158
Do you have any idea
why anyone would wanna hurt you?

15:58.182 --> 16:02.571
- No.
- Any ex-boyfriends?

16:03.114 --> 16:04.114
No.

16:04.740 --> 16:08.239
This is the man who almost killed you
outside the club. You recognise him?

16:10.412 --> 16:14.172
He might have been with the man
who grabbed me in the club last night.

16:14.196 --> 16:16.331
But l... I can't remember.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.765
Well, you suffered a concussion.

16:19.789 --> 16:22.015
It's not uncommon for events
immediately preceding

16:22.039 --> 16:24.646
that sort of injury to be a little fuzzy.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.858
You should probably go back
to the hospital.

16:26.882 --> 16:29.567
- No.
- Do you want us to help you?

16:29.591 --> 16:31.448
Do you?

16:31.472 --> 16:33.526
If we don't,
you're probably gonna end up dead.

16:33.550 --> 16:36.656
Right now, we're your only friends.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.142
And maybe this Deng here...

16:39.731 --> 16:42.353
Maybe he wasn't trying to kill
Petty Officer Bronson.

16:42.943 --> 16:44.377
Maybe he was trying to kill you.

16:44.401 --> 16:47.903
Why? I don't even know him, okay?
Or Bronson or any of them.

16:57.289 --> 16:59.388
She's hard to read.

16:59.412 --> 17:02.132
The girl's been on her own
a long time.

17:02.156 --> 17:05.977
She's used to taking care of herself.
It's a defence mechanism.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.960
Bury your identity to protect it.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.361
Okay.

17:11.385 --> 17:15.218
Well, she might have seen or heard
something and not even know it.

17:15.682 --> 17:16.926
Any word on our gunman?

17:17.558 --> 17:18.613
No. Car had no plates.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.619
Eric wasn't able to find the vehicle
on any street or traffic cams.

17:21.644 --> 17:23.390
Perfect.

17:24.190 --> 17:25.660
Where the hell is Sam?

17:25.684 --> 17:27.400
Thanks.

17:32.364 --> 17:33.395
Hey.

17:35.158 --> 17:36.321
Here.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.784
Thank you.

17:39.996 --> 17:43.281
How'd you make out Saturday
on your SATs?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.472
Seven hundred and ten in math.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.269
That's nice.

17:48.293 --> 17:50.122
It's not math I'm worried about.

17:50.714 --> 17:52.339
Four hundred writing.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.400
Okay. Okay.

17:55.424 --> 17:56.874
It's getting there.

18:00.265 --> 18:02.970
I still remember the first time
you took me to the sea.

18:05.228 --> 18:06.746
Gulf of Aden.

18:06.770 --> 18:08.811
You were 8.

18:09.023 --> 18:12.024
I'd never seen so much water.

18:12.401 --> 18:14.892
The ocean made you feel safe.

18:15.487 --> 18:18.192
It only makes me feel smaller.

18:18.741 --> 18:20.400
What makes you feel safe?

18:21.702 --> 18:23.493
Being around my friends.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.341
I've already told you before,

18:25.365 --> 18:28.184
that youth centre has a bad reputation
for teaching radical views.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.924
Americans have a bad reputation
in some parts of the world.

18:30.948 --> 18:35.848
In this country, if I wear baggy clothes,
I'm a hip-hop gangster.

18:35.872 --> 18:38.504
If I wear a taqiyah, I'm a terrorist.

18:39.677 --> 18:42.547
At the youth centre,
I am just Mowahd.

18:47.684 --> 18:49.558
You know this guy?

18:51.605 --> 18:54.071
That's Deng. Deng Oyat.

18:54.095 --> 18:55.827
Is he in some sort of trouble?

18:55.851 --> 18:57.899
Trouble?

18:58.194 --> 18:59.225
He's dead.

19:02.490 --> 19:04.542
Crashed a stolen car into some people
last night.

19:04.566 --> 19:06.378
I saw him last week.
Why would he do that?

19:06.402 --> 19:08.795
He doesn't even have
a driver's licence.

19:08.819 --> 19:10.217
He was with another man.

19:10.241 --> 19:11.908
Older, scruffy.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.453
Might be passing himself off
as Hispanic.

19:18.296 --> 19:20.253
You know him, don't you?

19:21.883 --> 19:25.334
- Do you know him?
- I've seen him talking to Deng.

19:26.512 --> 19:28.777
He gives religious lectures.
His name's Safar.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.467
What kind of religious lectures?

19:31.559 --> 19:33.278
I don't know. I don't attend.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.561
I keep telling you,
I only go there to play basketball.

19:37.147 --> 19:38.950
Does Safar have a last name?

19:38.974 --> 19:40.940
Jaddalah.

19:41.151 --> 19:43.285
Born in Algeria, raised in Libya.

19:43.309 --> 19:48.041
Safar Jaddalah's file reads like a
Who's Who of Islamic militant groups.

19:48.065 --> 19:49.877
He's moved around a lot

19:49.901 --> 19:53.053
and he's suspected,
along with other al Qaeda members,

19:53.077 --> 19:55.926
of having entered Sudan
to train the Janjaweed.

19:55.950 --> 19:58.222
Devils on horseback with guns.

19:58.246 --> 20:01.892
They've traded in their horses for
SUVs and upgraded their weaponry.

20:01.916 --> 20:03.890
So, what's Safar doing in L. A?

20:03.914 --> 20:06.271
I doubt he's auditioning
for American Idol.

20:06.295 --> 20:08.850
Recruiting alienated
and impressionable young men.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.234
Just like that group of Somali teens
in Minneapolis.

20:11.258 --> 20:13.314
He takes them back,
indoctrinates them,

20:13.338 --> 20:14.985
and gets them to fight his jihad.

20:15.009 --> 20:18.574
Well, maybe he hired Cesar Vargas
to smuggle him into the country.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.654
He probably came in
over the Mexican border,

20:20.678 --> 20:22.704
passed himself off
as a Mexican American

20:22.728 --> 20:25.910
and killed Vargas
to tie up any loose ends.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.956
What's a religious fundamentalist
doing in a strip club?

20:28.980 --> 20:33.044
9/11 hijackers did
the same thing before their attacks.

20:33.068 --> 20:36.882
Last night's incident could have been
a glitch in an even bigger plan, guys.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.971
And Deng Oyat was prepared to die
to protect it?

20:39.995 --> 20:43.165
Deng Oyat did
what Safar ordered him to do.

20:43.793 --> 20:47.517
Dom, alert Homeland Security
and brief Director Vance.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.100
I'll put Safar's face out there,

20:49.124 --> 20:51.266
talk to the other agencies,
local law enforcement.

20:51.290 --> 20:52.522
See if they have anything.

20:52.546 --> 20:55.588
Eric, find this guy.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.191
How well does this kid Moe
know Safar?

21:00.215 --> 21:01.992
He doesn't. He knows of him.

21:02.016 --> 21:04.094
And how do you know the kid?

21:04.520 --> 21:05.528
I brought him here.

21:05.552 --> 21:07.604
From Sudan?

21:12.361 --> 21:15.124
I was in Chad,
a part of the Pan Sahel Initiative.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.456
We were called into Sudan
to rescue some aid workers.

21:17.480 --> 21:21.465
Moe's father was killed
and Moe was injured during a firefight.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.453
I figured it was the least I could do.

21:28.835 --> 21:31.480
- Sam.
- How's Katya?

21:31.504 --> 21:33.390
Scared but tough.

21:33.414 --> 21:36.186
She's clearly affected by you
and Kensi saving her.

21:36.210 --> 21:39.479
She's not accustomed to having people
do anything for her.

21:39.503 --> 21:42.275
She wants to go back to her house
and get some of her things.

21:42.299 --> 21:44.240
I told her I had to talk to you about it.

21:44.264 --> 21:45.975
Maybe you could go over there.

23:12.598 --> 23:15.065
I thought you might need
a few things.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.616
- You went back to my house?
- Yeah.

23:17.640 --> 23:22.023
I wasn't sure what you'd want, so l...
I brought a little bit of everything.

23:26.278 --> 23:28.293
Let go of me.

23:28.317 --> 23:30.753
Sit down. You wanna run, fine.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.167
I'll call ICE.
I'll have you on a plane to Kiev.

23:33.191 --> 23:35.656
What do you want from me?

23:36.162 --> 23:37.905
The truth would be a good place
to start.

23:55.245 --> 23:57.487
Your boss, Dallas,

23:58.206 --> 23:59.701
all these are his?

24:00.208 --> 24:01.750
Yes.

24:02.294 --> 24:06.647
And for the men who were shy
and insisted on lights being off,

24:06.671 --> 24:08.499
night vision.

24:09.008 --> 24:10.668
Blackmail.

24:11.928 --> 24:12.935
Who?

24:12.959 --> 24:18.890
Anyone who might have something to
hide or something that Dallas wanted.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.346
Know him?

24:29.319 --> 24:30.789
- Yes.
- At the club?

24:30.813 --> 24:32.267
- Yes.
- At your house?

24:33.364 --> 24:36.448
Dallas told us
he was a very special VIP.

24:37.952 --> 24:39.909
They called him a buyer.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.590
I don't like where this is heading.

24:42.614 --> 24:45.339
Dallas' girls compromise
military personnel

24:45.363 --> 24:47.558
with access
to classified information.

24:47.582 --> 24:49.970
Dallas then decides to sell
that information.

24:49.994 --> 24:51.974
And Safar buys it.

24:51.998 --> 24:54.272
Maybe to help plan a terrorist attack.

24:54.296 --> 24:57.729
Why would Safar have someone
drive a car into Dallas' club?

24:57.753 --> 25:01.108
Somewhere along the line
the deal went sour.

25:01.132 --> 25:03.525
We gotta get a look
at Dallas' video collection.

25:03.549 --> 25:04.947
- Search warrant?
- No.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.196
Safar finds out the club's been raided,
he's gone.

25:07.220 --> 25:09.697
We'll never find out what he's up to
until it's too late.

25:09.721 --> 25:12.650
Okay, so how do we get in?

25:12.943 --> 25:14.520
Her.

25:18.949 --> 25:20.502
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

25:20.526 --> 25:22.111
Yeah.

25:46.141 --> 25:48.050
Hey, there.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.910
Looky here.

25:50.934 --> 25:52.183
Well, well, well.

25:55.608 --> 25:57.896
Hey, baby.

25:59.737 --> 26:01.776
Stand by, G. She's on her way in.

26:04.408 --> 26:06.317
Hey, boss.

26:07.035 --> 26:08.754
Katya.

26:08.778 --> 26:10.009
How's Dallas reacting?

26:10.033 --> 26:15.579
Oh, like his best girl just
got back and he didn't expect her.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.813
Katya said Dallas' hard drive
is in a storage area over the kitchen.

26:19.837 --> 26:22.128
Camera access?

26:22.341 --> 26:23.776
Nothing we can hack into.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.007
Hey, good luck.

26:38.773 --> 26:41.038
It's a little bit crowded
in here, you know?

26:41.062 --> 26:42.490
Can Dallas see us?

26:42.514 --> 26:44.401
Well,

26:44.820 --> 26:48.746
I am sure he's been watching us
since you came over here.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.033
All right. Let's do this.

27:03.004 --> 27:04.723
We are gonna have fun.

27:04.747 --> 27:06.606
One for the VIP room.

27:06.630 --> 27:08.851
Give us a good show.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.438
All right.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.510
Let them go through.

27:13.264 --> 27:16.217
- Yeah, she's coming through.
- Okay.

27:53.843 --> 27:56.002
That's my girl.

27:57.638 --> 27:58.646
Oh, hey.

27:58.670 --> 28:00.698
They got at least
three cameras, Sam.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.136
Possibly more.

28:06.146 --> 28:09.242
If we turn on the jammer, Dallas is not
the only one who's gonna lose picture.

28:09.266 --> 28:11.623
I'm gonna need
about a 20-second burst

28:11.647 --> 28:15.270
to get me out the door
and down the hall.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.001
Twenty second burst.

28:17.025 --> 28:18.479
Initiating now.

28:22.203 --> 28:23.210
Go.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.239
- Nineteen.
- Security card.

28:26.374 --> 28:30.288
- Third door down. On the left.
- Fourteen, 13, 12.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.986
- Seven.
- He needs to be down the hall now.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.675
Six.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.108
Five.

28:47.132 --> 28:48.424
Four.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.823
Two, one, zero.

28:53.847 --> 28:55.281
Jammer's off.

28:55.305 --> 28:56.978
Tell me you're in the kitchen.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.779
G, you reading me?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.238
We got picture, no audio.

29:42.528 --> 29:45.315
Accessing computer now.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.029
Where is he?

30:04.007 --> 30:05.607
Everybody out. Out.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.484
I got company, Sam.

30:07.508 --> 30:09.219
Sam?

30:35.453 --> 30:38.002
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Kitchen's closed.

30:38.026 --> 30:40.363
How's that for a lap dance, hm?

30:41.458 --> 30:43.498
You got a warrant
to go into my place?

30:44.336 --> 30:47.835
FISA warrant.
Terrorism investigation.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.684
I'm not a terrorist.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.519
I'm a patriot.

30:51.543 --> 30:54.149
Is that why you fell out with Safar?

30:54.173 --> 30:56.137
Is that why he attacked your club?

30:58.015 --> 30:59.783
All good questions.

30:59.807 --> 31:01.138
For my lawyer.

31:02.144 --> 31:05.595
- He's smug.
- I hate smug.

31:05.814 --> 31:08.305
Guy thinks he's gonna walk
out of here. Hm.

31:09.526 --> 31:10.747
Is he gonna walk out of here?

31:10.771 --> 31:13.649
It depends what's on those tapes.

31:15.282 --> 31:16.313
There. Him.

31:16.950 --> 31:19.417
- Who's he?
- I think he's a senator.

31:19.441 --> 31:20.709
Which one?

31:20.733 --> 31:23.485
Okay, well,
maybe he's a congressman.

31:24.081 --> 31:25.635
Okay, another one
for the maybe column.

31:25.659 --> 31:27.208
What do we got?

31:28.460 --> 31:30.144
At least a dozen identified,

31:30.168 --> 31:34.062
including two senators,
the CEO of an aeronautical company,

31:34.086 --> 31:38.278
a former child star
and four senior military officers.

31:38.302 --> 31:40.106
And we are only
a third of the way done.

31:40.130 --> 31:42.357
- Safar? Keep looking.
- Not yet.

31:42.381 --> 31:45.071
No, Eric.
You don't need to keep looking.

31:45.095 --> 31:48.577
- This investigation is over.
- You're shutting us down?

31:48.601 --> 31:53.978
All evidence, physical and electronic
is to be sent to DOD.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.122
What about Dallas?

31:56.146 --> 31:59.854
We're under orders to release him
immediately.

32:14.577 --> 32:18.053
Hetty, we're putting together
a good case here, okay? A big one.

32:18.077 --> 32:20.679
Hetty, Safar is up to something.
We can't stop now.

32:20.703 --> 32:23.520
This is coming from on high.

32:23.544 --> 32:28.598
When I say on high,
I mean those with the political venom

32:28.622 --> 32:32.144
to end the careers of each
and every one of us,

32:32.168 --> 32:34.692
including Director Vance.

32:34.716 --> 32:37.781
I can't believe this.
All we need is a little more time.

32:37.805 --> 32:38.981
I know. I know.

32:39.005 --> 32:41.971
If I may slip into the vernacular,
it sucks.

32:43.688 --> 32:47.792
But when you hear from me again
in an hour or so,

32:47.816 --> 32:52.361
you will shut this down.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.966
Don't forget to release Mr. Dallas.

32:57.990 --> 33:00.674
Guys, you gotta see this.

33:00.698 --> 33:02.720
Fire it up on the big screen.

33:02.744 --> 33:04.990
I don't think we want this
up on the big screen.

33:06.042 --> 33:10.122
So look what I found on Dallas'
sleaziest home videos.

33:14.258 --> 33:16.855
I'm guessing Safar's imam
would not approve of that.

33:16.879 --> 33:18.132
Definitely haram.

33:19.138 --> 33:20.359
What's that?

33:20.383 --> 33:22.240
It's Arabic. It means forbidden.

33:22.264 --> 33:24.946
No, no, no, what...? What's that?

33:24.970 --> 33:27.432
Whatever it is, it can't be good for you.

33:28.605 --> 33:31.286
Oh, come on.
I'm in up to my knickers now.

33:31.310 --> 33:34.495
Dallas is an extortionist.
Once he got these guys on the hook,

33:34.519 --> 33:36.912
there's no telling
what information he got out of them.

33:36.936 --> 33:38.631
Technology, money, secrets.

33:38.655 --> 33:41.468
I mean, he was a clearing house
for confidential information.

33:41.492 --> 33:44.920
Safar must have known this. He went
to Dallas for something specific.

33:44.944 --> 33:48.430
Weapons, intelligence. Maybe both.

33:48.454 --> 33:50.142
Or maybe as a part of their deal,

33:50.166 --> 33:53.476
Dallas offered Safar a night with one
of their girls as a sign of good faith.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.896
Okay, it's disgusting,
but perfectly probable.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.853
So Safar is being blackmailed
like everybody else?

33:59.877 --> 34:02.518
But why would Dallas blackmail Safar
if they got a deal going?

34:02.542 --> 34:04.938
Dallas is a criminal,
but he's not a traitor.

34:04.962 --> 34:06.858
It's not like Safar
could go to the police.

34:06.882 --> 34:09.987
- He could drive a car into the club.
- That's an interesting theory,

34:10.011 --> 34:13.161
but Safar is a terrorist.
He's not Miss America.

34:13.186 --> 34:17.197
Why would he care
if anyone had a sex tape on him

34:17.222 --> 34:19.665
despite the feculent content?

34:19.688 --> 34:23.335
He's recruiting idealistic young men to
fight a holy war in the name of Islam.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.666
If a sex scandal can bring down
a Democrat,

34:25.690 --> 34:28.879
what do you think that means for
a Muslim on the road to martyrdom?

34:28.902 --> 34:31.925
- Couldn't he just denounce it as fake?
- Publicly, sure.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.676
I'm guessing if that got out,

34:33.699 --> 34:36.175
Safar is sleeping
on Salman Rushdie's sofa.

34:36.199 --> 34:41.667
So you think you can lure Safar
out of hiding with this tape?

34:41.922 --> 34:44.379
But you don't even know
where to find him.

34:52.975 --> 34:55.976
Hey, I need to get a message
to Safar.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.540
I know some of you listen to his
teachings and know how to reach him.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.332
A friend of mine
has something he wants.

35:01.356 --> 35:03.909
All the information he needs
is right here.

35:03.933 --> 35:05.688
All right? Just plug it in.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.172
My friend's number's on it.

35:08.196 --> 35:09.693
Carry on, gentlemen.

35:21.669 --> 35:24.338
Beginning to think
you weren't gonna show up.

35:26.298 --> 35:30.023
I hope you brought cash because
I don't take traveller's cheques.

35:30.047 --> 35:33.967
I am not paying you or Dallas
or anyone.

35:34.473 --> 35:36.108
Is that what you came out here
to tell me?

35:36.132 --> 35:38.609
Look, you know the deal, Safar.

35:38.633 --> 35:43.246
Either you pay me $50,000, or your
little sexcapade goes out on CNN,

35:43.270 --> 35:45.075
Al Jazeera
and the Home Shopping Network.

35:45.099 --> 35:48.500
- Not if you're dead.
- Kill me. Tape still goes out.

35:48.524 --> 35:51.920
It won't matter. By then you, the girl
and Dallas will all be dead

35:51.944 --> 35:54.107
and I shall be forgiven.

35:55.033 --> 35:56.254
That's your plan?

35:56.278 --> 35:58.384
What, you gonna shoot me here
in broad daylight?

35:58.408 --> 36:00.737
You won't even make it off the pier.

36:01.915 --> 36:04.702
After I shoot you,
I'm gonna shoot that elderly man

36:05.543 --> 36:07.844
and then those children,

36:07.868 --> 36:10.512
and several of those young women
before I have to reload.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.683
By then no one will be getting
in my way.

36:12.707 --> 36:16.145
All right, point taken. Let's take a walk
and find a private place.

36:16.169 --> 36:19.441
- Just leave them out of it.
- The time for words is over.

36:19.465 --> 36:21.217
Gun.

36:23.769 --> 36:25.761
Don't move.

36:27.898 --> 36:28.977
Turn over.

36:34.529 --> 36:35.987
Get up.

36:38.908 --> 36:41.612
I am but one in a legion of warriors.

36:42.286 --> 36:45.179
True warriors don't use innocent kids
to do their dirty work.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.945
You are the friend of Mowahd.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.265
The man who killed his father.

36:50.289 --> 36:53.722
- What?
- Who is using children now?

36:53.746 --> 36:57.017
I'm not using anybody.
I gave Moe a new life.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.043
And now so have I.

36:59.636 --> 37:00.856
What's that supposed to mean?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.856
- Back off.
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.360
- Not this way.
- No. Sam.

37:04.384 --> 37:06.134
Sam.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.642
Moe.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.704
What's going on, man?
Where you going?

37:17.728 --> 37:19.752
Hey, where you going?

37:19.776 --> 37:21.998
I got your message to Safar.
What else do you want?

37:22.022 --> 37:24.416
Listen. Hold up.
I'm not letting you get on that van

37:24.440 --> 37:26.135
until you tell me where you're going.

37:26.159 --> 37:28.046
- You can't stop me.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

37:28.070 --> 37:29.716
- What are you gonna do, huh?
- Wait.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.324
Kill me like you killed my father?

37:33.083 --> 37:34.875
Is it true?

37:35.711 --> 37:38.474
- Did you murder my father?
- I was protecting innocent people.

37:38.498 --> 37:40.499
Your father was working
with the Janjaweed.

37:41.299 --> 37:42.900
Everything you said to me is a lie.

37:42.924 --> 37:45.548
No, come on. No, no, no.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.781
I didn't... I didn't lie to you.

37:48.805 --> 37:52.650
I didn't tell you everything
because I wanted to protect you, man.

37:52.674 --> 37:54.536
I know you're hurt, all right?

37:54.560 --> 37:57.990
Well, I'll tell you everything you wanna
know about me, about your father.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.874
Let's just go talk about this.

37:59.898 --> 38:02.273
The time for words is over.

38:04.071 --> 38:05.422
Goodbye, Sam.

38:05.446 --> 38:08.105
Moe. Moe.

38:18.584 --> 38:20.185
So I got a lawyer for Katya.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.595
Still not sure how
that's going to play out.

38:22.619 --> 38:24.599
- Did Sam hear anything?
- No.

38:24.623 --> 38:26.316
What about the deal on Safar?

38:26.340 --> 38:27.860
Turned him over to the CIA.

38:27.884 --> 38:30.565
They'll turn him into an asset,
put him to work,

38:30.589 --> 38:32.280
find out what he was planning.

38:32.304 --> 38:35.734
They also took
the blackmail material.

38:35.758 --> 38:37.902
Do you think that will ever see
the light of day?

38:37.926 --> 38:39.407
Not publicly.

38:39.431 --> 38:40.742
But it will be put to use.

38:40.766 --> 38:44.532
On the street it's called blackmail.
In government, it's leverage.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.786
Well, speaking of leverage,

38:46.810 --> 38:50.331
Hetty told me I had to give in
my case reports every Friday by 5

38:50.355 --> 38:53.757
and I was really counting on having
the weekends to get caught up.

38:53.781 --> 38:55.006
I'll talk to her.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.672
Awesome. Thank you.

38:56.696 --> 38:59.195
You are my hero.

39:03.126 --> 39:06.886
- Did you find Moe?
- No, his foster family has no idea.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.021
Youth centre is claiming ignorance.

39:09.045 --> 39:10.733
I got a hit on Moe's passport.

39:10.757 --> 39:12.609
He's on an Air France flight to Paris.

39:12.633 --> 39:15.257
- What time does it leave?
- Left.

39:15.888 --> 39:17.821
Sorry, by the time you told me
to start looking

39:17.845 --> 39:19.651
- it was too late.
- It's all right, Eric.

39:19.675 --> 39:21.309
Is Paris his final destination?

39:22.144 --> 39:24.492
No. He's on a connecting flight

39:24.516 --> 39:28.139
from Charles de Gaulle
to N'Djamena, Chad.

39:29.943 --> 39:33.122
From there he'll probably try
to slide across the border into Sudan.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.625
Why would he go back?

39:34.649 --> 39:37.064
He's looking for answers.

39:37.325 --> 39:38.984
Keep tracking him.

39:42.705 --> 39:45.789
Moe's father used to work
with the Janjaweed.

39:48.335 --> 39:50.043
I killed him.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.837
Does Moe know?

39:56.217 --> 39:58.091
Now he does.

39:58.386 --> 40:00.462
So, what are you gonna do about it?

40:01.472 --> 40:03.132
Right now?

40:04.809 --> 40:06.718
Go for a run.

40:09.354 --> 40:13.352
Last time you said that, I had to drive
out to Joshua Tree to pick you up.

40:14.234 --> 40:16.368
- I'll bring my cell phone.
- Damn. Damn.

40:16.392 --> 40:18.645
- Damn.
- What's up with Hetty?

40:20.615 --> 40:22.358
You too?

40:35.712 --> 40:37.480
So is this another
money-saving cutback?

40:37.504 --> 40:40.958
Or are you, uh,
writing your tell-all Hollywood memoir?

40:43.386 --> 40:46.720
It's a eulogy for an old friend.

40:49.475 --> 40:50.720
I'm sorry.

40:53.145 --> 40:55.470
This was his typewriter.

40:56.357 --> 41:00.413
It seemed fitting.
Almost poetic three hours ago.

41:00.437 --> 41:05.189
Now it just seems like
a lachrymose act of folly.

41:05.991 --> 41:07.758
Well, I can't help you there.

41:07.782 --> 41:09.362
Lachrymose intolerant.

41:11.287 --> 41:13.778
You would have liked him.

41:14.123 --> 41:20.920
He was the perfect combination
of scholar, soldier and scoundrel.

41:21.714 --> 41:23.172
Was he a romantic friend?

41:26.802 --> 41:27.802
No.

41:28.762 --> 41:32.522
No, I'm afraid he was married
to his job.

41:32.546 --> 41:36.448
He worked for the Intelligence Service
in England.

41:36.472 --> 41:37.699
Never married.

41:37.723 --> 41:41.596
No children, but a stellar career.

41:42.692 --> 41:48.895
He died alone in his office
filling out paperwork.

41:50.574 --> 41:53.634
Something you'll never have
to worry about.

41:53.658 --> 41:56.376
Is that why Nate's being forced
into exile?

41:56.400 --> 42:00.304
That man hasn't taken a vacation
in years.

42:00.328 --> 42:01.591
And what about you?

42:01.615 --> 42:07.747
When was the last time you took a
day off that wasn't caused by a bullet?

42:08.382 --> 42:12.332
I don't want you waking up one
morning wondering if it was all worth it.

42:12.970 --> 42:19.257
I'm sorry if I was
a tad strident today.

42:20.185 --> 42:23.518
I just want to make sure

42:23.813 --> 42:29.056
that you all take the time
to smell the roses.

42:39.620 --> 42:40.734
How about Saturday?

42:41.872 --> 42:44.493
There's a Rembrandt exhibit
at the Norton Simon museum.

42:45.751 --> 42:46.972
Pick you up at 11?

42:46.996 --> 42:49.184
Rembrandt, Mr. Callen?

42:49.208 --> 42:50.434
Don't get too excited.

42:50.458 --> 42:53.441
I just go there to meet chicks.

42:53.465 --> 42:55.424
Essentially, you'll be my wingman.

42:56.094 --> 43:01.467
I relish the assignment.
If only it were true.

43:02.433 --> 43:04.888
What about tonight?

43:08.188 --> 43:10.644
I think I'm going for a run.

43:16.738 --> 43:18.837
Tell me we're not running
to Joshua Tree this time.

43:18.861 --> 43:19.861
No.

43:27.206 --> 43:29.578
Oh, bugger.
