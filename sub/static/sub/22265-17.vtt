18:58.240 --> 19:00.947
It's more like I own you.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.702
You don't--

19:04.800 --> 19:07.109
And it's time you get in line, boy.

19:08.640 --> 19:12.337
If that's how you feel,
I believe I'm done here.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.623
Good day.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.424
(SCOFFS)

19:19.760 --> 19:22.103
You're done when I say you're done.

You're gonna learn, son.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.105
You do what I say when I say it.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.700
And if you ever even think
about sassing me again...

20:01.040 --> 20:02.257
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

20:02.800 --> 20:03.824
Ah!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.661
Look what you did to my suit.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.948
Okay, what the hell, man? I mean...

20:12.280 --> 20:14.464
We tested her for everything.
Holy water, silver.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.629
She passed it all, so--

20:15.720 --> 20:17.938
Yeah, and she's been down
in a basement for 90 years.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.587
How does she look the way she does?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.466
And this doesn't sound like
the Men of Letters, either.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.697
I mean, they're boring.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.304
They wore tweed. They smoked from pipes.
They don't kidnap people.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.425
Except, apparently, they did.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.307
Oh, and this... The flash of light
Sandy talks about seeing,

20:31.400 --> 20:32.947
the rip in the air? Sounds like--

20:33.040 --> 20:34.587
Like a rift. So what now?

20:34.680 --> 20:35.999
They're opening doors
in different worlds

20:36.080 --> 20:37.399
and Buffalo Billing chicks.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.029
And feeding a monster,
so not boring after all.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.983
But all the Men of Letters
died 60 years ago.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.069
Longer than that.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.582
So then who's been
keeping her down there?

20:49.840 --> 20:52.980
You know what? How about this?
You stay here with Sandy. I'll go back--

20:53.080 --> 20:54.786
- No, no, no. What?
- What?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.381
I'm not gonna let you
go back there by yourself.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.822
- Dean--
- No, this is what we're gonna do.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.909
We're gonna find Sandy a motel room.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.581
We're gonna have to teach her
how to use the TV.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.547
Well, you're gonna have to tell her what
a TV is, and then we're gonna go back--

21:03.640 --> 21:09.499
Here we go, lobster roll, no bun,
and kale Salad for you, string bean.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.386
- Kale's a garnish.
- It's healthy.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.698
I'm watching my cholesterol.
Like you should be.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.663
Yeah, I'm watching my cholesterol.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.463
Watching it go up.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.829
Well, I guess
I'll see you later. (SIGHS)

21:23.920 --> 21:24.909
All right.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.579
What the hell?

21:39.120 --> 21:43.068
Clam cakes. Two orders of stuffies.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.582
See? Garnish.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.467
And meatloaf for our young lady.

Sammy!

24:10.280 --> 24:11.304
They're still out there.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.742
We gotta call the police.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.137
My phone's not working.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.657
They're all dead.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.824
And landline, too.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.977
Who's that?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.479
The police.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.697
What are you doing?

24:36.240 --> 24:38.583
They took my brother.
I'm gonna get him back.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.383
Who are you? What do you want?

24:55.440 --> 24:56.702
What you stole from us.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.420
- The monster.
- The what?

24:59.760 --> 25:02.183
Less a monster, more a god.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.629
A...

25:05.040 --> 25:06.257
Wait. What are you talking about?

25:06.440 --> 25:07.657
How'd you find our Chapterhouse?

25:10.480 --> 25:12.744
(STAMMERING) My brother and I, we're...

25:13.800 --> 25:16.064
Our family was Men of Letters.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.217
So was ours.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.709
Kind of.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.749
Kind of?

25:22.320 --> 25:25.460
Our great-grandfather, Diego Avila,
was a member.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.160
- Well, until he--
- He went psycho.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.577
Jim Jones style.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.297
Pretty much.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.627
Diego fought in World War I,
and after that,

25:34.760 --> 25:37.183
all he could see was blood and violence
In this world,

25:37.280 --> 25:39.180
so he decided to fix it.

25:40.960 --> 25:41.949
H ow?

25:42.040 --> 25:44.543
Summon a god from another dimension
and start over.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.937
"Upon us, we shall call forth new gods,

25:48.080 --> 25:50.184

Then it tried to summon its mate
before they bound it.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.860
MARCO: Men of Letters
disavowed the whole deal.

26:16.040 --> 26:19.066
It banned all the survivors,
closed down the Chapterhouse tight.

26:19.200 --> 26:23.022
Our grandparents, our parents, us,

26:24.040 --> 26:25.905
we've been watching over it ever since.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.469

26:56.520 --> 26:58.101
But you, Mr. Ketch,

26:58.200 --> 27:00.942
you are more wicked
than any demon I know.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.786
I know them all.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.697
At least I still have a soul.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.823

27:13.040 --> 27:17.261
Souls are messy,
all conflict and confusion.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.788
I know who I am.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.742
Do you?

27:23.760 --> 27:26.183
Because you say you have this code,

27:26.280 --> 27:30.660
this Men of Letters code,
handed down for centuries.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.399
But wait. Wait a minute.
You work for me.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.146
You act like
you're this cold-blooded killer.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.817
But you know what I see
when I look in your eyes?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.142
Fear

27:49.160 --> 27:50.548
and regret

27:51.160 --> 27:52.502
and pain.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.297
I see your chewy middle, boy.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.741
You want redemption,

28:03.400 --> 28:05.379
but you ain't never gonna get it.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.507
Your kind, our kind,

28:08.680 --> 28:10.500
we can't be redeemed.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.979
All we can do is spread our pain around.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.906
So, no, you don't know who you are.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.621
But I do,

28:21.880 --> 28:26.340
which is why no matter where you go,
no matter what you do,

28:28.080 --> 28:29.661
you're mine.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.017
Are they gone?

28:40.800 --> 28:42.745
Someone should see if they're gone.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.945
No. No, not happening.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.424
You're trying to tell me Sandy is a god
from another dimension?

29:07.520 --> 29:08.987
All she wants to do is eat.

29:09.320 --> 29:10.344
And breed.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.079
Then why didn't you kill it?

29:12.280 --> 29:13.304
You don't think we've tried?

29:14.520 --> 29:15.942
As far as we know, she can't die.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.537
So we have been keeping her locked up.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.747
Well, that is, until you came along.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.943
So, you know, nice work on that one.

When we saw what you did,
we knew that we had to get her back.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.267
So Marco slipped something
into your food.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.028
You don't say.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.346
We have been starving Yokoth
for decades,

29:37.440 --> 29:38.702
keeping her weak.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.825
But if she gets food in her belly...

29:41.160 --> 29:42.627

(BOTH GRUNTING)

35:10.000 --> 35:11.706
You can't kill me!

35:17.600 --> 35:19.704
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

35:20.800 --> 35:21.869
No!

35:23.960 --> 35:25.029
(SCREAMS)

35:33.920 --> 35:35.581
(PANTING)

35:36.800 --> 35:37.824
Dean.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.624
(DEAN GRUNTS)

35:43.040 --> 35:44.621
Glad you could make it.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.589
So that's why we came.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.659
I mean, we need the seal
to get our family back.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.825
If it could take us somewhere
other than tentacle porn land...

36:00.920 --> 36:02.501
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.780
When you cast a spell, you need a guide,

36:04.920 --> 36:06.239
something that's been
where you need to go.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.506
- Got it?
- Got it.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.904
Careful.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.946
When you open the door,
it only stays open for 24 hours.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.479
And you never know
what's on the other side.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.187
Well, whatever it is, we'll be ready.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.662
I hope you're right.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.463
(DEAN GRUNTS)

36:31.560 --> 36:33.664
(CHUCKLES) You sure you're all right?

36:33.920 --> 36:34.944
(CHUCKLES)

36:35.040 --> 36:36.826
Considering I was about
three seconds away

36:36.920 --> 36:38.820
from being an
interdimensional booty call, yeah,

36:38.920 --> 36:40.137
I'd say I'm all right

36:40.240 --> 36:41.343
(CHUCKLES) Well,

36:43.600 --> 36:44.783
we have the Seal.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.224
Right?

36:46.520 --> 36:48.829
So all we need now is an archangel,
and we're set.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.387
Sure, that sounds easy.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.221
(SCOFFS) Yeah.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.181
- MR. KETCH: Wait.
- Son of a bitch.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.102
I come in peace.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.143
Yeah, right.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.659
And I brought you a gift.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.622
(WHIMPERING SOFI'LY)

37:05.840 --> 37:07.228
Wait a second. Is that...

37:09.600 --> 37:10.669
Gabriel?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.220
No, no, that's impossible. He...

37:15.680 --> 37:17.625
He's dead. We saw him die.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.422
Or did you?

37:20.160 --> 37:21.502
What did you do to him?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.626
Not me. Asmodeus.

37:24.240 --> 37:28.222
The Prince was holding him prisoner
until I liberated the poor man.

37:28.920 --> 37:33.857
And I understand you may need
an archangel for a spell, perhaps.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.744
Well, what luck.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.399
We need his grace.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.584
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

37:41.680 --> 37:43.068
No, no, no.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.380
- Calm down. Calm down.
-(PANTING)

37:47.480 --> 37:48.663
Nervy.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.149
Here.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.947
Take that. And...

37:59.560 --> 38:02.586
The archangel blade.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.987
Why would you...

38:10.040 --> 38:12.019
What's the catch? What do you want?

38:12.640 --> 38:13.902
Protection,

38:14.520 --> 38:15.623
from Asmodeus.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.983
The one you're working for?

38:17.080 --> 38:19.105
Was working for.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.625
But when he finds out
that I stole his prize milk cow,

38:23.720 --> 38:26.905
well, I imagine that he'll hunt me
to the ends of the Earth.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.023
So

38:31.320 --> 38:33.777
this is the only safe place I know.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.377
(SCOFFS) What? Do you think
you're just gonna move in?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.422
Dibs on the top bunk?

38:39.920 --> 38:41.137
- No.
- Deal.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.589
What?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.305
I don't know
what the hell's going on here.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.900
But if this helps us get Mom back,
helps us get Jack back,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.423
then sure.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.662
Whatever you want.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.269
(WHIMPERING SOFI'LY)

39:10.400 --> 39:11.469
SAM: Gabriel.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.982
Man, what happened to you?

39:16.080 --> 39:17.786
All right, let's do this.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.384
Well, shouldn't we wait?

39:22.560 --> 39:23.697
Wait? Why?

39:24.600 --> 39:25.589
We got everything we need.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.227
Everything else
is just burning daylight. Come on.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.582
Let's open this door.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.063
All right.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.023
I'll gather my gear.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.701
Uh... Hold on.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.279
I'm heading in alone.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.463
What?

39:42.680 --> 39:44.625
Look, we got a busted-up archangel here.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.504
And who the hell knows what else? Okay?

39:47.600 --> 39:49.704
Somebody's gotta stay here just in case.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.948
MR. KETCH: And I'm coming with you.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.025
As I said, Asmodeus will be hunting me
to the ends of the Earth,

39:58.120 --> 40:01.419
so it's better if I'm not on this Earth.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.581
It's not that much better over_ there.
You know it's a war zone, right?

40:04.680 --> 40:08.184
Won't be my first.
Shan't be my last. Hmm?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.105
- Fine.
-"Fine"?

40:13.560 --> 40:16.120
So you want Ketch to go and not me?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.417
I don't care if he dies.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.261
Hell, I'm kind of rooting for it.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.823
- Still, you can't--
- No, I have to.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.187
It takes something
that's been over there before

40:26.280 --> 40:28.737
to open up the right door,
so that's either you or me.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.347
So I'm gonna go.

40:30.640 --> 40:31.959
And if something happens to me,

40:32.040 --> 40:35.783
if time runs out,
then I need you to come and save me

40:35.880 --> 40:38.622
and save Mom
and save whoever else, okay?

40:38.840 --> 40:41.183
It's safer if we go together.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.589
There's no such thing
as safer over there. You know that.

40:45.640 --> 40:49.098
I know you don't like this, okay?
I don't expect you to.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.861
But this is the way it's gonna be.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.359
Something that's been there, right?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.017
-(CUP HUMMING)
- All right.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.825
Remember, it's only 24 hours.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.703
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:37.800 --> 41:38.824
Okay.
