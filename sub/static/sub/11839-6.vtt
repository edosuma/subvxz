WEBVTT

00:12.947 --> 00:14.646
>> CHARLIE: Turn this up.
This is my jam right here.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.315
>> DENNIS: Oh, yeah... Oh, shit!
Did I just miss the turn?

00:16.317 --> 00:18.150
>> MAC: Oh, yeah, dude.
I think it was back there.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.485
>> Aw, man! You better hurry up.
We're gonna miss that boat!

00:19.487 --> 00:21.120
>> Well, don't blame me.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.855
It took Dee a goddamn hour to
get dressed like a man.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.456
>> DEE: Nah. Captain Barnacle.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.026
It's a great new character I'm
working on. Argh!

00:27.028 --> 00:28.494
>> FRANK: Give me another worm,
Charlie.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.029
>> All right, coming up.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.897
You want rum or julep?
That's a rum one...

00:31.899 --> 00:32.898
>> I'll take the rum one.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.133
>> You guys brought worms in
here?

00:34.135 --> 00:35.701
>> Well, we kind of soaked them

00:35.703 --> 00:37.369
in alcohol and you suck the
alcohol off of them.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.238
>> Ah!
>> I ate mine.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.306
>> You're gonna ruin this!
How often do boat parties come

00:41.308 --> 00:43.142
around and with hot mainline
women? This is a classy event.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.144
It took me hours to get us
invited to this.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.012
>> Oh-oh! There's the boat.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.347
(Dennis groans)

00:48.349 --> 00:49.882
>> Goddamn it! We missed it. Aw!

00:49.884 --> 00:51.050
This is great! This is exactly

00:51.052 --> 00:52.051
what I was worried about!

00:52.053 --> 00:53.052
Great, guys. Way to go.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.053
You know what? Screw it.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.054
I'm going in.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.055
>> What-what are you talking

00:56.057 --> 00:57.056
talking about?

00:57.058 --> 00:58.057
>> We're going in.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.058
>> Not in the water?

00:59.060 --> 01:00.092
>> Yes, we're going in the wa...

01:00.094 --> 01:01.093
Look, guys, this car was built

01:01.095 --> 01:02.094
for this, okay?

01:02.096 --> 01:03.262
It's got air intake valves.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.064
This is precision British land-

01:05.066 --> 01:06.832
to-sea craftsmanship at work.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.400
We're going in.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.102
We're not missing that boat.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.171
(tires screech)

01:35.763 --> 01:36.962
>> What have we become?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.864
I mean, we have literally and

01:38.866 --> 01:40.432
figuratively missed the boat.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.367
I used to be a cool guy, right?

01:42.369 --> 01:43.869
With a cool car hanging out all

01:43.871 --> 01:45.270
the time.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.805
And now I'm a... what am I?

01:46.807 --> 01:47.906
I'm a chauffeur to a bunch of

01:47.908 --> 01:49.241
worm-sucking idiots!

01:49.243 --> 01:50.943
>> You? What about me?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.444
I used to be a party boy who

01:52.446 --> 01:53.579
banged chicks all the time.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.581
You guys remember?

01:55.583 --> 01:56.648
But no one was ever good enough

01:56.650 --> 01:57.649
for you, dude.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.650
So, I got self-conscious and

01:58.652 --> 01:59.651
I stopped-- because of you, I

01:59.653 --> 02:00.786
changed who I am at my core!

02:00.788 --> 02:01.820
>> Mac, Mac, that is not what

02:01.822 --> 02:02.888
happened, okay?

02:02.890 --> 02:03.889
You are completely delusional.

02:03.891 --> 02:04.923
I mean, and by the way, all of

02:04.925 --> 02:06.892
us have become so goddamn weird.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.727
>> I think we're just hitting
our stride.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.095
>> Oh, you think we're "hitting
our stride," Frank, really?

02:10.097 --> 02:11.263
>> Yeah!

02:11.265 --> 02:12.331
>> 'Cause Dee's in a goddamn

02:12.333 --> 02:13.765
costume every other day.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.933
As a matter of fact, we all are.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.101
I think we have more costumes in

02:16.103 --> 02:17.436
the bar than we do kegs.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.837
I mean, what, what if I said I

02:18.839 --> 02:20.305
wanted to become a man cheetah

02:20.307 --> 02:21.607
right now, what would you do?

02:21.609 --> 02:22.841
>> I'd go get the spots.

02:22.843 --> 02:23.842
>> He's got spots!

02:23.844 --> 02:24.843
Why do you have spots?

02:24.845 --> 02:25.844
You shouldn't have spots.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.845
That's absurd, man.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.846
That's absurd. You know what?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.848
I actually, I blame you for most
of this.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.849
>> Me?

02:30.851 --> 02:31.850
>> Yeah, because you came in

02:31.852 --> 02:32.851
here with your endless goddamn

02:32.853 --> 02:33.852
supply of money and financed all

02:33.854 --> 02:34.853
this bizarre behavior!

02:34.855 --> 02:36.922
>> You were plenty weird before
me.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.956
What about the underage

02:37.958 --> 02:39.291
drinking scheme?

02:39.293 --> 02:40.526
I wasn't even here for that.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.660
>> But that made sense, Frank.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.661
It worked.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.662
>> You know what? I got to get

02:43.664 --> 02:44.663
away from you people.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.664
That's what it is.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.832
I-I-I-I fly off the handle every

02:46.834 --> 02:48.267
five seconds now.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.268
>> You know what?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.269
I got to get away from you

02:50.271 --> 02:51.303
people-- you're all insane.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.304
I'm storming out!

02:52.306 --> 02:53.438
>> What? Don't copy me!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.607
I'm the one who's angry.
Goddamn it!

02:55.609 --> 02:58.043
>> You don't storm out on me.
I storm out on you.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.212
>> I'm the one who storms out!
I'm the one who... Oh, oh, oh!

03:00.214 --> 03:01.980
Yeah, no, no. Okay.
You know what? Yeah.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.949
That's fine. Storm out.
Get angry.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.984
You guys be that guy 'cause I'm
not gonna be that guy anymore.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.352
I'm not gonna get angry
and shit.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.887
I'm gonna cool off.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.889
I'm gonna go back to being what
I was before.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.991
A cool guy who just hangs out
and has a cool car.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.027
So, I'm not gonna storm out, but
I am gonna leave.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.863
I'm gonna... leave casually.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.538
>> You want to get lunch?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.539
>> Sure.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.608
>> Yeah?

03:32.513 --> 03:35.414
>> When was the last time, like,
just you and me went out to eat?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.416
It's been a while, right?
>> By ourselves?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.418
>> Yeah.
>> I don't even know.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.420
>> It's nice to go to a diner,
too, you know?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.422
Like, I like diners.
>> Yes.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.357
>> I appreciate a menu with
pictures.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.426
>> It makes it easier.
>> It's like sometimes those

03:47.428 --> 03:49.428
guys make me do things that
aren't really me, you know?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.430
>> Yeah.
>> Like, okay, like, I kind of

03:51.432 --> 03:53.432
feel compelled to call you a
bird right now and throw my

03:53.434 --> 03:55.100
glass of water in your face.
>> Right.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.102
>> But, uh, you know, I'm
realizing that I only do that

03:57.104 --> 03:58.170
stuff 'cause I don't want the

03:58.172 --> 03:59.171
guys to do it to me first, you

03:59.173 --> 04:00.172
know what I mean?

04:00.174 --> 04:01.173
>> Of course I do.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.174
You know what I was about to do?

04:02.176 --> 04:03.175
Pretend that I had to go to the

04:03.177 --> 04:04.176
bathroom and then I was gonna

04:04.178 --> 04:05.177
sneak out the window and just

04:05.179 --> 04:06.178
get out of here 'cause I was

04:06.180 --> 04:07.179
afraid you were gonna do that to

04:07.181 --> 04:08.180
me first.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.181
>> Oh, right, right, right.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.182
>> Isn't that weird?

04:10.184 --> 04:11.850
>> I was, though.
>> Oh.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.851
>> Yeah, yeah. But again, I

04:12.853 --> 04:13.852
think it was... 'cause, like,

04:13.854 --> 04:14.886
that's what the guys would've

04:14.888 --> 04:15.887
done and...

04:15.889 --> 04:16.888
>> It's the peer pressure thing

04:16.890 --> 04:17.889
from those guys.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.890
>> Right. Okay. Well, forget the

04:18.892 --> 04:19.891
the guys today, right?

04:19.893 --> 04:20.926
They're not here. So, um...

04:20.928 --> 04:21.927
>> Yeah.

04:21.929 --> 04:22.928
>> Like, what do you want to do?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.929
>> Uh, let's see.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.197
I'd like to order my food in a

04:25.199 --> 04:26.398
German accent.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.566
>> Right, right. Okay, cool.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.700
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:28.702 --> 04:29.701
>> Why?

04:29.703 --> 04:30.702
>> I guess that's just... I put

04:30.704 --> 04:31.903
all these expectations on myself

04:31.905 --> 04:33.372
to be funny all the time.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.373
You know? Because that's what

04:34.375 --> 04:35.374
people have come to expect

04:35.376 --> 04:36.375
from me.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.376
But that's not fair.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.377
It's too much pressure for me.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.378
>> Yeah, right.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.379
No, I don't think anyone

04:40.381 --> 04:41.380
expects that at all.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.381
>> Wait, what about you?

04:42.383 --> 04:43.415
What do you want to do?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.449
>> Okay, uh, well, I would like

04:44.451 --> 04:45.584
to get a chicken sandwich, but,

04:45.586 --> 04:46.918
uh, but I think I want to get

04:46.920 --> 04:48.253
the beak on the side?

04:48.255 --> 04:49.254
>> Mm.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.255
>> Frank's always making me eat

04:50.257 --> 04:51.256
it first and frankly I'd rather

04:51.258 --> 04:52.291
it last if I'm gonna have to eat

04:52.293 --> 04:53.292
it all...

04:53.294 --> 04:54.293
>> Ooh, I can help you here.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.495
Instead of eating it last, you

04:56.497 --> 04:57.963
don't have to eat beak at all.

04:57.965 --> 04:58.964
>> Oh!

04:58.966 --> 04:59.965
>> Ready to order?

04:59.967 --> 05:00.966
>> Ooh!

05:00.968 --> 05:01.967
>> Yeah.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.068
>> (German accent):<i> Ja,</i> vell,

05:03.070 --> 05:04.436
uh, I vould like ze...

05:04.438 --> 05:05.771
I'm sorry.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.839
I would like a chicken sandwich,

05:07.841 --> 05:09.007
please.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.108
>> Okay. And you?

05:10.110 --> 05:11.109
>> Beak!

05:11.111 --> 05:12.144
>> No!

05:12.146 --> 05:13.145
>> No.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.146
>> No.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.748
>> Regular chicken sandwich.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.816
>> That's it?

05:17.818 --> 05:18.817
>> That's it for him.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.985
>> Okay.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.353
(laughs)

05:21.355 --> 05:22.354
>> You did it! You did it.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.355
>> God, I really wanted to

05:23.357 --> 05:24.356
say it!

05:24.358 --> 05:25.357
>> I saw that you wanted to say

05:25.359 --> 05:26.358
it badly.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.359
>> Yeah, all right, well, this

05:27.361 --> 05:28.360
is good.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.361
>> This is great. This...

05:29.363 --> 05:30.362
I'm very proud of you.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.363
>> This is very good. All right.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.364
Look at us! Cheers!

05:32.366 --> 05:33.365
Yeah.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.434
No beak.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.803
>> Bob, I want to thank you for

05:37.805 --> 05:39.271
answering my ad so quickly.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.439
>> Well, I really needed a car

05:40.441 --> 05:42.441
and I always wanted a Range
Rover.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.442
>> Yeah, well...

05:43.444 --> 05:44.443
Hey, I got to tell you, though.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.444
This is not just a car.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.712
This is a lifestyle.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.946
This is an Eddie Bauer edition.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.381
Tortoise-shell interior,

05:49.383 --> 05:50.816
super-charged twin cam, European

05:50.818 --> 05:52.351
luxury sports utility vehicle,

05:52.353 --> 05:53.352
my friend.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.386
>> Wow!

05:54.388 --> 05:55.387
>> Yeah! It's a classic, okay?

05:55.389 --> 05:56.388
The only reason I'm giving her

05:56.390 --> 05:57.389
up is 'cause I'm ready

05:57.391 --> 05:58.390
to turn a page.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.391
>> Yeah.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.459
>> I'm thinking about getting an

06:00.461 --> 06:01.460
Alfa Romeo, what do you think?

06:01.462 --> 06:02.461
Two seats-- me and a babe.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.462
You like babes, Bob?

06:03.464 --> 06:04.463
>> Oh, yeah, sure!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.031
>> Yeah! Who doesn't like babes?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.633
Yeah, yeah. It's a wonderful
machine.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.135
I used it to traverse the plains

06:10.137 --> 06:11.803
the Serengeti of my life.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.472
Now, I want that for you, Bob.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.675
There she is.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.577
>> I'm sorry.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.678
Are you talking about the car in

06:19.680 --> 06:20.679
the river?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.314
>> Yeah. Well, it's an

06:22.316 --> 06:24.983
amphibious exploring vehicle,
so...

06:24.985 --> 06:27.152
>> You-you think you can pull it
out of the river?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.920
>> No, no! What fun would that
be, right?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.355
That's not my job.
That's your job.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.090
I don't want to take that
from you.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.159
You're gonna love it.
>> Yeah, right, but I just, I

06:34.161 --> 06:35.827
didn't bring a change of clothes
or anything.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.162
>> That's not really my fault,
is it?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.197
Yeah, I got to say, uh, your

06:39.199 --> 06:41.199
line of questioning's starting
to, it's starting to annoy me.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.201
>> Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I just, you know, I thought I

06:43.203 --> 06:45.203
was gonna see a car on land.
>> You being cute right now?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.205
>> No.
>> Is that what's happening?

06:47.207 --> 06:49.207
>> I'm not being cute.
>> And no sale! How about that?

06:49.209 --> 06:51.243
'Cause you don't deserve the
car.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.245
The car has spoken, I have
spoken.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.346
You obviously don't get what's

06:54.348 --> 06:55.347
happening here.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.348
So, be gone with you!

06:56.350 --> 06:57.582
>> All right.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.851
>> There's that anger coming up
again.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.052
I'm getting weird and arch.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.087
But that's the gang's fault.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.088
That-that's not me.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.122
I'm fine, see? I'm...

07:04.124 --> 07:05.457
I'm calm, man.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.691
I'm cool as a cucumber.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.059
It's all good. It's all good.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.227
Talking to myself, but that's

07:09.229 --> 07:10.262
just 'cause I, you know, I've

07:10.264 --> 07:12.464
got shit to say, you know?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.368
>> ♪ Uh-huh, this my shit ♪

07:16.370 --> 07:18.737
♪ All the girls stomp your feet
like this... ♪

07:18.739 --> 07:19.738

07:19.740 --> 07:20.939
Hey, I'm Mac, former party boy.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.140
Looking to get back into the

07:22.142 --> 07:23.375
party-boy scene.

07:23.377 --> 07:24.576
You want me to milk your

07:24.578 --> 07:25.744
adrenal gland?

07:25.746 --> 07:26.945
You'll go berserk.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.647
Heh? No?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.881
That's all right.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.082
Ugly anyway.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.485
You're gonna find that ass to
crush.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.228
>> Hey, listen, the hell with
Dennis.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.396
Don't let him screw up a good

07:44.398 --> 07:45.597
thing that we got.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.766
Come on, we'll start our own
crew.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.967
>> Beat it, jabroni.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.168
Hey, look at that.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.670
>> What?

07:51.672 --> 07:52.904
Oh, that?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.105
Is that what you want?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.307
I can get you all that you want.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.308
>> Maybe I've been thinking

07:56.310 --> 07:57.509
about this all wrong.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.677
You know, man?

07:58.679 --> 07:59.678
Maybe I've been lying to myself

07:59.680 --> 08:00.912
all these years.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.113
Maybe that's what I need.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.984
>> Well, we've always known
that.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.754
>> Party boy coming your way.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.956
>> Guys, we did it.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.157
>> We did it.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.358
>> Opened a bar.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.593
>> Hey, gang.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.760
Frank.

08:15.762 --> 08:16.962
>> Oh, hello.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.530
>> I just parted ways with my

08:18.532 --> 08:19.865
old crew, and I'm looking for

08:19.867 --> 08:21.700
a new one.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.202
I'm a financier... of fun things

08:24.204 --> 08:26.938
like schemes and pranks and
such.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.139
You got anything?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.341
You interested?

08:29.343 --> 08:30.876
>> What?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.110
>> Uh, what are you celebrating?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.513
>> Uh, we-we just bought a bar
together.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.714
>> You just bought a bar?

08:35.716 --> 08:36.882
That is fantastic.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.116
That's perfect.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.317
Next round's on me.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.519
>> Uh, thank you.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.720
>> Awesome.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.189
>> Cheers!

08:49.530 --> 08:51.530
>> You know, Mac and Dennis
aren't here-- they're not gonna

08:51.532 --> 08:53.365
ridicule us-- we get to just
pick whatever we want to do.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.166
>> Well, you know I like making
music.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.301
>> Yeah, and I like listening to

08:56.303 --> 08:57.302
it, but it hasn't really ever

08:57.304 --> 08:58.870
gotten us anywhere in the past,

08:58.872 --> 08:59.905
so, well, what about poetry?

08:59.907 --> 09:00.906
>> I like poetry, but only if

09:00.908 --> 09:02.140
it's def.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.141
>> Def Poetry.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.342
>> Yeah, like Def Poetry slams.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.645
>> Those are awesome.
>> Yeah.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.580
>> I love that.
What happened to that?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.649
>> I don't know. Did people just
stop thinking they were cool?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.751
>> That's crazy. Black people
don't do stuff that's not cool.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.753
>> Yeah, so...
>> He doesn't deserve the car,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.755
and that's the plain and simple
of it.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.990
>> Are you crying?
>> No, I wasn't...

09:18.992 --> 09:20.825
It's humid outside, all right?
That-that's why they're moist...

09:20.827 --> 09:22.360
I don't have to explain myself
to a worm-sucking idiot.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.995
Dee, where's the computer?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.196
>> I thought you were gonna try
and control your rage.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.932
>> This is irritation, okay?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.900
There's a difference.
>> And why are you irritated?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.602
>> I'm irritated because I'm
having trouble finding a proper

09:30.604 --> 09:32.437
buyer for the Range Rover.
I need to create a new ad to

09:32.439 --> 09:34.172
attract an appropriate buyer,
all right?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.874
Not some asshole who's got
a problem with the car

09:35.876 --> 09:37.075
being in a river.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.076
It's awesome that the car is in

09:38.078 --> 09:39.244
a river.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.245
I need someone who can see that.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.114
>> Arrogance, vanity-- all over.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.517
He's underwater, like a Range
Rover.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.518
>> I'm sorry, what is this?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.719
What are you doing?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.920
>> Def Poetry.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.121
>> Don't do that.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.790
>> Makeup... smearin'.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.525
No power steerin'.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.560
He be talkin', but we don't

09:55.562 --> 09:56.761
be hearin'.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.296
>> I command you to stop.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.565
>> Speaks like Zeus.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.766
>> Smells like poops.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.368
>> Rage all over from his head

10:03.370 --> 10:05.770
down to his shoes.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.306
>> Zeus, poops and shoes?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.541
Guys, you suck at Def Poetry.

10:09.543 --> 10:10.742
You know what?

10:10.744 --> 10:11.943
>> Announcement-- I have an

10:11.945 --> 10:13.144
announcement to make, all right?

10:13.146 --> 10:14.312
Thank you for gathering for me.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.914
I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and

10:15.916 --> 10:17.115
it's totally sweet.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.283
You guys probably want me to

10:18.285 --> 10:19.484
burn it, but I won't, all right?

10:19.486 --> 10:20.719
Now, I like this choice.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.554
I like the choices I've made.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.289
I like who I am, all right?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.490
But I realize I've been lying to

10:25.492 --> 10:26.725
myself over the past few years.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.926
And I'm done lying, okay?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.127
And I found someone who's gonna

10:29.129 --> 10:30.295
allow me to be me.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.496
>> Okay, good.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.497
>> Oh, good, all right, yeah.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.732
>> Great. Finally. Yes.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.899
>> Let's do this.

10:34.901 --> 10:35.934
>> That all makes sense.

10:35.936 --> 10:36.935
Let's get this over with.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.136
>> We're ready.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.304
>> Let's talk about this.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.305
>> Yeah. Yes! Guys, I'd like you

10:40.307 --> 10:42.574
to meet the love of my life,
Dusty.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.775
Come on in, Dusty.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.976
>> Why did I have to wait in

10:44.978 --> 10:46.177
the hall?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.345
>> Oh, I was doing a thing for

10:47.347 --> 10:48.580
my friends.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.581
>> No, no, no, Dusty's a man.

10:49.583 --> 10:50.782
Where is Dusty?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.983
>> No, Dusty is a... woman.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.184
Why would you think...?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.352
Oh, because of the name.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.587
No, no, she's called Dusty

10:55.589 --> 10:57.989
because she's really into angel
dust.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.190
>> I am super into angel dust.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.358
>> Does she have a dick?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.593
>> Why would you think she has

11:01.595 --> 11:02.794
a dick?

11:02.796 --> 11:03.795
>> Come on, what-what was that

11:03.797 --> 11:04.829
whole speech about, then?

11:04.831 --> 11:05.964
>> Oh, well, the last few years,

11:05.966 --> 11:07.499
I've been settling for fives,

11:07.501 --> 11:08.533
you know, and I've been giving

11:08.535 --> 11:09.768
you the tens, okay?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.969
But then I realized, you know

11:10.971 --> 11:12.203
what, I can be a ten guy, too.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.605
I saw a ten, I went after a ten,

11:13.607 --> 11:14.806
and I got a ten.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.007
Let's go, Dusty.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.342
We don't need these turkeys.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.110
I'm gonna go slam ass.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.379
I'm gonna go bang this chick.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.281
>> What the hell is this?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.350
>> Anger... bubbling like a pot.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.551
>> Gettin' hot.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.353
>> Gonna explode like a bomb

11:28.355 --> 11:31.623
in a toad.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.991
>> You mark my words.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.993
If you decide to get into Def

11:34.995 --> 11:37.395
Poetry, you are going to fail

11:37.397 --> 11:40.065
and bomb and gag and fail and
bomb.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.299
It's... that's just... you know,

11:41.301 --> 11:42.467
but I don't care, man.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.668
That's cool.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.170
Do whatever you want, man.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.005
I-I'm a cool guy now, so... I'm

11:47.007 --> 11:48.540
gonna grab this laptop, I'm

11:48.542 --> 11:49.741
gonna go make a new ad for my

11:49.743 --> 11:50.975
awesome Range Rover, which I'm

11:50.977 --> 11:52.177
gonna sell, and then I'm gonna

11:52.179 --> 11:53.378
get myself an Alfa Romeo.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.546
You know?

11:54.548 --> 11:55.747
Just me and a babe.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.981
Just me and a babe.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.384
So, you guys do whatever you
want.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.552
(Dusty moaning passionately)

12:00.554 --> 12:01.753
>> Do you like it?

12:01.755 --> 12:05.757
(moaning continues)

12:05.759 --> 12:06.991
(laughter)

12:06.993 --> 12:08.193
>> Why would you say that?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.394
>> I'm just kidding.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.996
>> Guys, guys, guys, I got news.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.198
I got terrible news.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.399
>> Wait, dude, do I...?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.600
Oh, oh, yeah. Hey.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.835
You're the... you're that guy

12:16.837 --> 12:18.036
from the other night.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.104
I didn't... I didn't recognize

12:19.106 --> 12:20.338
you without the hairpiece.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.506
>> This is awful.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.707
There's a Jew trying to buy us

12:22.709 --> 12:23.908
out of everything.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.110
You want to get him back?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.111
>> What are you... what are you

12:26.113 --> 12:27.345
talking about?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.513
>> I don't know.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.547
W-Well, I'm not usually the idea

12:29.549 --> 12:31.449
man; I'm the money man.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.951
Okay, don't worry about it.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.285
What we'll do is we'll have a

12:34.287 --> 12:35.386
beer, and then we'll come up

12:35.388 --> 12:36.554
with something.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.589
>> Okay. You know, we really

12:37.591 --> 12:38.757
appreciated the drinks the other

12:38.759 --> 12:39.958
night, but we... we've got to

12:39.960 --> 12:41.192
get to work.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.393
>> You got to get a ferret down

12:42.395 --> 12:44.896
in the basement, because Charlie

12:44.898 --> 12:46.765
says ferrets scare the shit out

12:46.767 --> 12:47.966
of rats.

12:47.968 --> 12:48.967
>> What are you talking about?

12:48.969 --> 12:49.968
What is... what is... who...

12:49.970 --> 12:51.202
who is Charlie?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.403
>> You're Charlie.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.571
No, you're too tall.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.773
By any chance, do you have

12:54.775 --> 12:56.441
homosexual tendencies?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.877
You... you could be Dee, but

12:58.879 --> 13:00.111
you're smaller.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.579
You got a better body, I think.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.981
You-- I don't know... I don't

13:02.983 --> 13:04.282
know who the hell you are,

13:04.284 --> 13:05.984
'cause we didn't have a black.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.218
>> Sir, you got to get out of

13:07.220 --> 13:08.419
here.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.587
>> Oh. Oh, I get it.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.789
I get it.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.390
I got to prove myself, right?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.925
Okay, I get it.

13:13.927 --> 13:14.993
I'm gonna get to work, and I'll

13:14.995 --> 13:16.294
make it really happen, and this

13:16.296 --> 13:17.462
is so exciting.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.663
You guys, this is gonna be

13:18.665 --> 13:22.367
great.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.070
>> Our thinking: clear.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.939
Our rhymes: no fear.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.641
>> Our words, our passion that

13:29.643 --> 13:30.842
flows like beer.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.076
>> Misery!

13:32.078 --> 13:33.278
>> Chains.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.479
>> Thunder.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.680
>> Rain.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.681
>> We're chasing the dragon.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.682
>> We're chasing our pain.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.917
>> Now, stop, breathe.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.419
>> Unbroken.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.654
>> You're free.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.658
(both sigh deeply)

13:46.660 --> 13:48.359
Shit, that's def.
>> That's super def right there.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.961
>> Oh, shit, that was
the deffest.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.029
>> Hey, here's a crazy idea.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.931
>> Hmm?
>> Why don't we run out, go to

13:52.933 --> 13:54.666
an open-mic night, like,
right now? >> Right now?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.434
>> Yeah, Dee.
>> I'm scared.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.203
>> No, I know, but look, without
Mac and Dennis, like, constantly

13:58.205 --> 13:59.437
coming down on us, you're not
gonna bomb.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.105
You're gonna do great.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.841
You know, I-I just feel like I'm
feeling something.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.375
>> I'm totally feeling it.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.144
>> Something, like, crazy.
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.046
I guess we make a really good...
make a really good team.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.547
>> We do make a really good
team.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.548
>> You're calming me down, and

14:10.550 --> 14:11.516
we're good at this together.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.684
>> Cool, cool. All right.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.852
>> Let's do it. That's great.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.920
>> Let's go to it.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.192
(both chuckle)

14:26.366 --> 14:27.866
Oh, shit.
>> Whoops!

14:27.868 --> 14:28.967
(both laugh)

14:28.969 --> 14:31.135
(both groan goofily)

14:31.137 --> 14:32.337
(both laugh)

14:32.339 --> 14:34.138
Just kidding.
>> Oh, yeah.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.374
>> Yeah.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.257
♪ ♪

14:52.259 --> 14:53.324
>> Great crowd, huh?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.559
>> Yeah, big night!

14:54.561 --> 14:55.660
>> Hey-o!

14:55.662 --> 14:56.661
Beer me.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.996
What a crowd, huh?

14:57.998 --> 14:58.997
>> Oh. Hi.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.064
Uh, yeah.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.065
It's-it's good.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.100
It's busy.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.534
>> You're welcome.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.536
>> Wait, you brought all these
people here?

15:05.538 --> 15:08.106
>> I bought them all fake I.D.s.
>> Huh?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.074
>> Yeah. These are all underage

15:10.076 --> 15:12.143
kids-- tweens and such.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.847
I never got to do that scheme.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.916
>> Why?
Why-why would you do this?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.117
>> I don't know why they did it.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.852
They must've had a good reason.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.187
Oh, also, I let a ferret loose

15:23.189 --> 15:25.189
in here and called the health
inspector.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.457
>> What?! Why?!

15:26.459 --> 15:27.525
>> So you could do the thing,

15:27.527 --> 15:29.627
you know... snap to.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.362
You better do it quick, too.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.431
That kid looks sick as hell.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.941
>> Excuse me.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.575
Hi.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.778
You guys selling the car?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.247
>> Uh, yeah. Yes.
(clears throat) Hi.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.149
>> Hi. Yeah, I, uh, might like
to buy it.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.750
What do you want for it?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.485
>> Well, I was thinking
somewhere in the ballpark of the

15:54.487 --> 15:56.387
original price, but, uh...

15:56.389 --> 15:57.722
considering the circumstances,

15:57.724 --> 15:59.290
I'm open to a reasonable
discussion.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.291
>> All right.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.726
I mean, it is an amphibious

16:01.728 --> 16:03.061
exploring vehicle, so it should

16:03.063 --> 16:04.295
be fine, right?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.730
>> Yes.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.465
Yes, absolutely.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.300
It's nice to talk to a
reasonable man.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.135
(chuckles)

16:11.137 --> 16:13.304
Now, are you a sportsman?
Because you look very fit.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.106
>> Oh, I ski.
>> You ski?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.474
Oh, excellent.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.508
Love skiing.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.110
Yeah. Do you travel a lot?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.144
>> For work, yeah.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.446
>> Europe? Eastern Europe?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.081
>> Ah, all over, really.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.148
>> And I assume you'll be taking

16:24.150 --> 16:26.684
the car with you on these trips?

16:26.686 --> 16:28.319
>> Me? Oh, no.
No, no, no.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.520
I'm-I'm looking for something

16:29.522 --> 16:31.589
for my daughter.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.827
>> Your daughter?
>> Yeah.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.262
You know, safe, slow vehicle.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.331
Good starter car.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.268
>> Starter car.
>> That's right.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.337
>> Mm.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.806
I have contained my rage for

16:48.808 --> 16:50.441
as long as possible, but I shall

16:50.443 --> 16:53.111
unleash my fury upon you like

16:53.113 --> 16:56.014
the crossing of a thousand
waves!

16:56.016 --> 16:57.181
Begone, vile man!

16:57.183 --> 16:58.883
Begone from me!

16:58.885 --> 16:59.984
A starter car?!

16:59.986 --> 17:02.020
This car is a finisher car!

17:02.022 --> 17:03.855
A transporter of gods!

17:03.857 --> 17:06.190
The golden god!

17:06.192 --> 17:08.192
I am untethered and my rage

17:08.194 --> 17:10.628
knows no bounds!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.373
>> Well, we're gonna figure this
out.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.641
>> I know.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.842
>> We're gonna, we're gonna...

17:24.844 --> 17:26.044
>> Hey! What's up, bitches?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.211
I'm a man cheetah.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.647
You want to do something with
this?

17:29.649 --> 17:30.848
(roars)

17:30.850 --> 17:32.050
>> We lost it.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.217
(crying): We lost our bar.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.419
>> Huh?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.653
>> Yeah. The health inspector

17:35.655 --> 17:36.854
called the police, man.

17:36.856 --> 17:37.855
The control board pulled our

17:37.857 --> 17:39.057
liquor license.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.426
>> And we got a $75,000 fine for

17:41.428 --> 17:42.660
serving minors.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.861
>> Well, uh, the other crew

17:43.863 --> 17:46.230
always had something up their
sleeve.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.432
I got an idea.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.834
>> We don't want to hear your
ideas.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.736
This is all your fault.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.073
>> No... well, wait, Kelly.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.240
Maybe he can help us.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.442
It sounds like he's used to this

17:57.444 --> 17:58.676
kind of thing.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.877
>> Really?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.079
>> Yeah, that-that's true.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.246
He got us into this mess.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.449
Maybe he can get us out of it.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.683
Okay, old man.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.218
What's your plan?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.454
>> What?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
(crying)

18:15.395 --> 18:16.594
>> Can I, um...?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.030
>> What?
No.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.399
>> There's a beer I want to...
>> Oh.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.936
>> So, you know, just... all
right? >> Yeah, I'm s... sorry.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.771
>> Okay. Do you want one, or...?
>> No. I... don't.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.106
>> All right. Good.
>> No.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.608
(Charlie chuckles)

18:32.045 --> 18:33.211
Is it cold in here?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.912
>> I'm not a thermostat, so...

18:34.914 --> 18:36.814
>> Okay. I'm sorry.
>> Okay, all right, all right,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.716
listen-- I want things to go
back to normal, okay?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.418
I don't like the way things have
become, and I want them to go

18:40.420 --> 18:41.986
back to the way they were.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.988
>> Listen up. I want things to
go back to normal.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.957
I don't like the way things are
going.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.225
I want 'em to go back to normal.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.260
>> What the hell are you doing,
man?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.728
>> I'm storming in.
>> I was storming in...

18:50.730 --> 18:52.096
What, are you a man cheetah?
>> Yeah.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.164
>> Cool.
>> You like it?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.099
>> Yes.
>> All right. Good.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.300
>> All right, come on, let's...
>> I can't do this anymore.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.802
That last crew sucked on ice.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.170
>> Okay, look, I like the man
cheetah thing.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.404
I want to go back to doing shit
like this.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.806
Are you guys on board?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.274
I want to go back to the way
things were.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.575
>> Oh, yeah, I mean,
we definitely...

19:04.577 --> 19:06.110
>> Definitely want things to be
normal again.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.812
We should go back in time.
>> Can we go way back in time?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.514
>> Can we go back a lot?
>> Okay, did you bomb and fail

19:09.516 --> 19:10.982
and bomb, just like I knew
you would?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.617
>> He did. He did.
>> Oh, yes, yeah, that's all

19:12.619 --> 19:14.285
that happened, and nothing
else happened other than that.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.753
>> There was a poetry thing.
It was bad.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.288
>> It was really bad poetry,
and... shut up, bird!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.289
>> You shut up! You can't read!

19:18.291 --> 19:19.290
(laughter)

19:19.292 --> 19:20.291
>> Okay, this is good, all

19:20.293 --> 19:21.292
right. Yeah, yeah. (roaring)

19:21.294 --> 19:22.326
>> Yeah, hey.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.427
>> Okay, this is good, this is

19:23.429 --> 19:24.629
good. So we're all in agreement?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.831
Frank, pay to get my car out of
the river.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.833
>> Yes. Done.
>> All right.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.268
(Dusty moaning passionately)

19:30.270 --> 19:31.536
>> Aah, shit, that's starting
again.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.004
>> Right, yeah, you know what?

19:33.006 --> 19:34.639
Mac's not gonna want to go back
to normal.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.140
He's been banging that hot chick
in the back office all day.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.608
>> No, I don't like this, okay?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.443
It's unnatural, and I won't
have it.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.945
I'm putting an end to this right

19:40.947 --> 19:42.680
now-- we're going back to
normal, yeah?

19:42.682 --> 19:43.948
>> Yeah, you like it?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.117
>> You know what...?
(moaning stops)

19:46.119 --> 19:48.653
What the hell's going on
in here? What is this?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.855
>> Oh, we totally just banged or
whatever.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.856
>> You're fully clothed, Mac.
