WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:05.092
- You know, Terry,
I snuck a peek in the shower,

00:05.135 --> 00:07.224
and for an old guy,
your penis still looks great.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.096
- [laughs]
You're a true gentleman.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.488
- Oh, it's wider
than it is long,

00:10.532 --> 00:11.837
but you make it work.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.926
- I'm happy to say
my 25-year streak

00:13.970 --> 00:17.278
of not looking at your penis
is still intact.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.149
- When you do catch a glance,
you're in for a treat.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.369
- Somebody's overcompensating.
- No, sir.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.848
Product makes the man.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.285
- Ehh.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.287
Okay, okay.
Enough of the cologne.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.941
- Cologne?
This is body spray.

00:28.985 --> 00:29.986
- You know, Eddie,
there's some things

00:30.030 --> 00:31.292
a man shouldn't engage in:

00:31.335 --> 00:33.207
plucking your eyebrows,
manicures--

00:33.250 --> 00:35.296
or, as I like to call them,
woman-icures...

00:35.339 --> 00:37.211
- Very clever.
- Saying "I'm sorry,"

00:37.254 --> 00:39.430
and perfumes.
- I disagree.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.389
Scenting oneself
is a sign of confidence.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.260
- I don't need a scent
to feel confident.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.001
I have confidence
to feel confident.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.525
This is all a man needs:
Kruckland soap.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.919
No scents, no nonsense.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.355
- Ugh.
Kruckland soap:

00:51.399 --> 00:53.270
unscented,
now with lavender.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.925
- I never saw that.
Now people are gonna sniff me

00:55.968 --> 00:57.100
and think I drink
gluten-free beer.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.884
- I like it.
You'll smell like a meadow

00:58.928 --> 01:00.277
after a spring rain.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.670
- Yeah.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.541

01:05.804 --> 01:07.110

01:07.154 --> 01:08.242
- Do you think the world
is ready to know

01:08.285 --> 01:10.070
about our
mustache-brushing secrets yet?

01:10.113 --> 01:12.681
- They never will.
[laughs]

01:12.724 --> 01:14.552

01:36.096 --> 01:38.185
- I never could pull off
the whole cologne thing.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.143
Back in high school,
I wore Polo for a week.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.275
Felt like a fraud.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.711
- I love wearing cologne, man.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.147
And as an exotic dancer,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.670
it's important
that you smell your best.

01:45.714 --> 01:49.370
I like to wear Disrobé
by Paco St. Laurent.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.154
The old ladies love it.
And as an added bonus,

01:51.198 --> 01:54.288
it tastes like bitter apple,
which discourages licking.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.159
- I like a guy
who smells natural.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.595
Like, when I watch
a Vin Diesel movie

01:57.639 --> 01:59.206
and he's all sweaty
with his sleeveless T-shirt,

01:59.249 --> 02:01.425
I just wanna jam my nose
into his bald armpit.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.166

to the little girl

02:03.210 --> 02:04.515

02:04.559 --> 02:06.300
- Chief, now that you've
broken up with your soap,

02:06.343 --> 02:08.389
I'm thinking it's time
for Terry McConky

02:08.432 --> 02:09.955
to adopt a signature scent.

02:09.999 --> 02:13.307
- I'd rather stick my nose
in Vin Diesel's bald armpit.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.786
- Well, he's got two of them.
I'll see you there.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.266
- Ugh, what's happening?

02:16.310 --> 02:18.138
- Hey, you might want
to reconsider, Chief.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.835
Studies say,
while men are attracted

02:19.878 --> 02:21.271
to their mate's looks,

02:21.315 --> 02:23.665
women are attracted
to the smell.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.970
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.363
- Studies also say

02:26.407 --> 02:28.887
the body's natural scent
changes with age,

02:28.931 --> 02:30.976
so middle-aged men
smell the worst.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.587
- I smell the way
I always smelled.

02:32.630 --> 02:33.631
- Yeah, fried doughy.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.243
- What? [sniffs]

02:36.286 --> 02:38.245
Mm. No, that's just doughy.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.334
- [laughs]
Okay, this game's over.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.205
Everyone get back to work.
[phone chimes]

02:42.249 --> 02:44.338
- Oh, hey.
It's Andy's birthday this week.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.078
both: Hey.
- [laughs]

02:46.122 --> 02:47.863
- It says you're
only gonna turn nine.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.734
- Yeah, I'm a leap year baby.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.345
I was born on February 29th,

02:51.388 --> 02:53.260
so my birthday's
every four years.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.870
- Uh-ho!
That must be so weird.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.872
So do you celebrate
on the 28th or the 1st?

02:56.915 --> 02:59.353
- Neither. My mom's
a real stickler for accuracy,

02:59.396 --> 03:01.224
so I've only celebrated
my birthday

03:01.268 --> 03:02.921
eight times in my entire life.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.575
[laughter]
- [mouthing] What?

03:04.619 --> 03:06.273
- I don't know why you think
that's so funny.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.971
- Well, when your sister's
your mom and your mom's

03:09.014 --> 03:10.451
your grandma,

03:10.494 --> 03:12.540
you take the laughs
where you can find them.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.456
[chuckles softly]
- Well, you know what?

03:15.499 --> 03:17.327
We are gonna celebrate the shit
outta your birthday this year.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.894
- I appreciate the thought,
Lucy,

03:18.937 --> 03:21.201
but Chief has a strict ban
on station birthday parties.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.376
- No, my dad loves
birthday parties.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.682
- Not station birthday parties.
- Why?

03:24.726 --> 03:27.294
- Apparently, he thinks
some past celebrations

03:27.337 --> 03:28.686
crossed the line.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.515
- Hey. Happy birthday.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.215
all: Oh!
- Yeah.

03:35.258 --> 03:39.131
- Oh-ho-ho, look at that!
It's me.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.221
- Happy birthday.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
Whoop. Oh.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.704
all: Oh.
- [laughing] Hey!

03:46.748 --> 03:49.098
- Oh, that's
a wholesome-looking cake.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.317
- My dick's inside it.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.057
[laughter]

03:52.101 --> 03:54.277
all: Oh!

03:54.321 --> 03:57.280
- Bottom line: your dad's
a station party pooper,

03:57.324 --> 03:58.542
and station birthday parties

03:58.586 --> 04:00.501
are his preferred parties
to poop on.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.198
- I'm sure my dad
would be willing

04:02.242 --> 04:03.417
to make an exception this year.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.419
- Chief is not gonna bend
the rules for me.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.333
He still thinks
I overcharged him

04:06.376 --> 04:07.856
for the carpet in his office.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.032
- Andy, I told you,
he doesn't think that.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.555
- Hey-oh, forgot my coffee.
- Oh.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.035
- Hey, Chief?
I have a question.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.515
I know you have a policy

04:14.558 --> 04:15.907
against
station birthday parties, but--

04:15.951 --> 04:17.300
- My policy is, I hate them.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
They're a waste of time
in the work day.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.477
You always gotta stop
what you're doin'.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.000
You gotta sign the card.
You gotta sing the song.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.176
You gotta eat the cake.
It always has a dick on it.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.482
- Yeah, that's the best part.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.441
- You wanna celebrate the day
you were born,

04:27.484 --> 04:29.312
do it on your time.
This is my time.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.922
- Chief, I don't know
if you remember this or not,

04:30.966 --> 04:33.142
but Andy was born
on a leap year, right? So--

04:33.185 --> 04:34.317
- And he overcharged me
for my carpet.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
- Oh, yeah.
That's right.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.538
- No station parties.
Test me on this,

04:37.581 --> 04:40.932
and you will be repainting
every fire hydrant in town.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.630
Okay?
Carry on.

04:44.153 --> 04:47.287
A lotta stuff here.
Huh. Evaporé.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.075
Empty.
That's weird.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.381
- Chief-y.
- Yeah. What's up?

04:54.424 --> 04:55.991
- Are you really gonna be
a hard-ass

04:56.034 --> 04:56.992
about this birthday party?

04:57.035 --> 04:58.080
- Ugh, you too?

04:58.123 --> 04:59.081
What are you, six years old?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.474
- It's a birthday party.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.518
- Have it at the bar
after the shift.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.128
You can all get drunk and hug.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.435
- [sighs] What's this?

05:05.479 --> 05:06.567
- These are bottles of cologne
that Vicky's given me

05:06.610 --> 05:08.351
over the years.
I never used them.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.570
And now, I'm wondering
if she was

05:09.613 --> 05:11.006
trying to tell me something.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.355
- Nah.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.487
- I've never been
a cologne guy,

05:13.530 --> 05:15.315
but maybe I was being selfish,
you know?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.664
She always got
so dolled up for me.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.056
- Let me help you.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.015
I have the best nose west
of the Rocky Mountains.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.451
- Mm, that sounds
made up to me.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.453
- Open any bottle.
I'll tell you what it is

05:23.497 --> 05:25.455
and the celebrity you hate
who endorses it.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.152
- I don't hate celebrities.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.850
I just want something
that smells good.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.634
- Try.
- Okay, ready?

05:32.984 --> 05:34.508
- Blimey, by Harry Styles.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.511
- Oh, ho, ho, ho. Pretty good.
He's a little British boy.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.251
- He is.
A little cherubim.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.862
- Please, sir.
I want some more.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.559
- Oh, I'm hungry, sir. Please!

05:42.603 --> 05:45.257
- I can't do that. Okay.
Try another one, then.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.390
- Okay.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.392
Unencumbered,
by Benedict Cumberbatch.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.395
- Oh, ho, ho, ho. Huh.
- Bada boom.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.614
Two for two.
- I don't like him.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.137
He's got those black,
beady eyes.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.486
- Like a doll's eyes.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.792
- You know
who I wanna smell like?

05:57.835 --> 06:00.316
Jason Statham.
I bet he smells like a man.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.449
- Statham has a cologne,
Transporté.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.581
[in British accent]
It always delivers.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.366
But you couldn't pull it off.
- How do you know?

06:06.409 --> 06:07.410
- Because you need something

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
that goes with onion rings.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.980
Like this one,

06:14.461 --> 06:15.853
How does anybody
figure this out?

06:15.897 --> 06:18.595
- Because they have a friend
named Eddie Penisi.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.381
And he knows someone
named Antonin Aroma.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.599
- Who's Antonin Aroma?

06:22.643 --> 06:23.818
- He's my scent mentor.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.646

06:34.611 --> 06:35.699
<i>I'll never let you cologne</i>

06:35.743 --> 06:37.484

- I mean, he's got</i>

06:37.527 --> 06:38.572
so much cologne
on the shelves behind him.

06:38.615 --> 06:39.964
He must know
what he's talking about.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.531
<i>- Mint, rosemary, sage,</i>

06:49.757 --> 06:51.323
- Hey, beam this
to my computer.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.369
- The word is cast,
you Luddite.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.675
You're asking me to cast it.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.241
- Okay, cast it to my computer.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.287
- I don't know how to do that.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.028
- Please stop
with the party stuff.

07:00.071 --> 07:03.161
- No. You only celebrate
your birthday every four years.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.599
And my dad's just being a dick.
I just wish there was a way

07:05.642 --> 07:07.644
we could throw
a party behind his back.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.516
- No, I don't wanna go
against the chief.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.387
Our relationship's
already on the skids.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.171
- Besides, throwing a party
behind his back?

07:13.215 --> 07:14.477
It's impossible.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.479
- No, Ike.
It is not impossible.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.611
- Well, what makes you think
it's possible?

07:17.654 --> 07:20.048
- Hm. What is this thing
on my jacket?

07:20.091 --> 07:24.400
Ah, that's right. Penisi.
So it is possible.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.141
That said,

23:53.519 --> 23:55.608
The penis.
- Oh.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.348
At least it's pixelated.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.481
- I like to say dicks-elated.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.136
- Hm, hm.
- Okay.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.617
- Moist.
- Yeah, not bad, right?
