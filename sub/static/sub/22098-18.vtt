NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

00:24.650 --> 00:26.442
STARBUCK: There are
survivors on Caprica.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.111
A resistance movement.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.781
ANDERS: We've been fighting the
Cylons, hitting them where we can.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.991
Now it looks like
they're here to stay.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.993
They're rebuilding Caprica.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.210
ADAMA: The first Sharon
was a sleeper agent.

00:44.294 --> 00:48.506
Didn't realize she was a Cylon
until her programming kicked in.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.434
I'm Sharon,
but I'm a different Sharon.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.810
And I'm here to help.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.521
No, I've decided
you are an expression

01:03.605 --> 01:05.732
of my subconscious mind
playing itself out

01:05.816 --> 01:07.483
during my waking states.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.445
So, I'm only in your head?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.575
BOOMER: I'm pregnant, Helo.
We're gonna have a child.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.911
Sharon is going
to bear our child?

01:19.455 --> 01:21.122
An honor for which
she is hardly deserving,

01:21.206 --> 01:23.833
but one doesn't question
God's will.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.918
The Cylons reincarnate.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.254
It makes sense, doesn't it?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.507
All our memories are
downloaded to a brand-new body.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.468
We're as good as new.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.595
Death becomes
a learning experience.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.316
Wait, there has to be
another way out of here.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.943
I mean... I mean, you
must have an escape plan.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.113
You're not about to be destroyed
by your own bombs, are you, huh?

01:54.198 --> 01:55.323
How are you leaving?

(SCREAMS)

01:59.828 --> 02:02.580
Gaius, I can't die.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.834
When this body's destroyed,
my memory,

02:06.919 --> 02:09.462
my consciousness will be
transmitted to a new one.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.382
I'll just wake up somewhere
else in an identical body.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.844
You mean, there's more
out there like you?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.139
There are 12 models.
I'm number six.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.307
I don't want to die.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.391
Get down.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.783
Do you love me?

(GASPING)

02:53.215 --> 02:54.507
Where? Where?

02:59.429 --> 03:00.513
I was in a house.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.266
D'ANNA: But you're
not in a house any longer.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.438
You're back with us.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.941
You've been reborn.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.861
I died?

03:15.279 --> 03:16.362
I died?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.866
That's right. You were in
a house. It was destroyed.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.534
A nuclear blast.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.328
But that is all over now.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.873
You have been downloaded
into a new body.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.760
Gaius.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.555
Gaius was in the house.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.266
Gaius Baltar?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.895
He's... Is he alive?

03:49.646 --> 03:50.646
Is he?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.732
(SHUSHING)

03:58.405 --> 03:59.947
BALTAR: I'm not really here.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.200
No one can see me but you.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.829
Don't let them know.

04:08.916 --> 04:13.628
Six, would it trouble you
if Dr. Baltar were dead?

04:14.671 --> 04:19.008
If they know
how you feel about me,

04:19.259 --> 04:20.676
it'll be a problem.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.647
It would be unfortunate

04:34.024 --> 04:35.232
if he died.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.526
He was so helpful.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.111
Very helpful.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.199
Your mission was
a resounding success.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.619
We completely disabled
the Colonial defenses.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.581
The attack succeeded beyond
our most optimistic projections,

04:50.666 --> 04:52.083
thanks to you.

I know there's pain, but
breathe. Ride through it.

We're going to
take care of you.

it symbolized rebirth.

BALTAR: It's a memorial.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.042
Do you know how many people died
in this park during the attack?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.794
How many people
in this park alone?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.129
It's gonna be lovely,
isn't it?

07:43.547 --> 07:44.839
This park.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.093
You know, a place to relax,
collect your thoughts.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.886
How you doing?

07:51.721 --> 07:52.888
I'm a little stiff.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.809
I'm still trying
to get used to this body.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.186
I mean,
I know it's identical,

08:00.772 --> 08:03.816
but even after all this time,
I still feel awkward.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.360
I was a klutz, too.
I used to knock things over.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.654
I was forever
tripping over things and...

08:09.406 --> 08:11.574
You know what,
you get over it.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.245
And you know what, this is
a great chance to cleanse.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.165
You've got a new body,
a new life.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.168
And anything that you've
built up, like anxieties

08:22.252 --> 08:23.586
or remorse or guilt,

08:25.213 --> 08:26.547

You are a war hero.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.935

08:42.063 --> 08:43.147
Excuse me.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.525
I just wanted to say, it's an honor
to have you here on Caprica with us.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.985
What you did...

08:49.613 --> 08:51.155

That's the epidural.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.305
What happened?

09:17.641 --> 09:19.433
You passed out
and started bleeding again,

09:25.482 --> 09:26.899

to all the trouble

09:26.983 --> 09:29.652
to appear human and didn't
upgrade the plumbing.

You're our first celebrity.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.521
No, I'm just another Six.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.399
You're too modest.
I'm just another Three,

10:08.483 --> 10:10.693
and they're Fives
and, oh, Eights.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.821
But you? Everyone
calls you Caprica Six,

10:14.030 --> 10:16.031
like you're the only Six
on the planet.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.326
And what you did
was incredibly difficult.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.370
To seduce a man

10:21.621 --> 10:24.915
so emotionally and physically,
so that he grants you access

10:25.000 --> 10:27.418
to all the most closely
guarded secrets of his people.

10:27.502 --> 10:31.297
I mean, that mission could
be profoundly disturbing.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.631
Disturbing?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.134
She mean sleeping with me
or killing billions of people?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.469
Because I rather thought
you enjoyed sleeping with me.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.346
It was difficult at times.

See, nobody here can possibly
understand what you've been through,

10:42.309 --> 10:43.726

we need your help.

been having trouble reintegrating

10:47.939 --> 10:49.231

Another hero, actually.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.611
An Eight still insists
on calling herself Sharon.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.822
And you thought I could help?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.117
I'm still having...

11:00.827 --> 11:02.453
I'm having problems
of my own.

11:02.746 --> 11:06.498
Caprica, you don't understand.
She really needs your help.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.252
If we don't turn her around
soon, there's talk of boxing her.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.339
Putting her memories in cold
storage? You can't be serious!

11:13.423 --> 11:16.008
Well, that's a charming way to
deal with emotional problems.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.344
One might almost
call it inhuman.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.346
Oh, that's right, you are.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.141
All right, look, it is a last
resort. But she's been regressing.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.355
Please.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.190
She's living up there
in that apartment.

It's the one she had when
she thought she was human.

The third bullet-head
walks the perimeter.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.711
The bullet-head walking perimeter
makes random changes to his patrol.

on Caprica, you know what that makes you?

about your God?

so I could screw people over.

And then I betrayed them.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.625
Feign fear and emotional vulnerability.
You're very good, you know.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.753
But I'm better.
Let me help you.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.713
I'm different.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.051
I'm different.

16:10.053 --> 16:13.055
I'm more like you.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.809
I had someone
I met here. A man.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.979
I loved him and I think he
could've loved me eventually.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.915
Half a cigarette should give us two or
three minutes to get the frak out of there.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.335
Any longer and we risk them finding
the charges before they go off.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.962
Is it two minutes or three?

16:46.047 --> 16:47.339
About to find out.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.509
This is a risky operation just to
nail a couple of dozen skin jobs.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.136
You know, we can't kill them.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.806
They'll just download
into a new body, and...

16:57.100 --> 16:58.642
I mean, what's the point?

16:58.726 --> 17:00.727
That skin job with Starbuck,

17:00.812 --> 17:02.604
Sharon, they called her,

17:02.855 --> 17:06.441
she said that when they download,
they remember everything,

17:06.609 --> 17:08.360
right up until the end.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.613
These skin jobs are gonna remember
being blown into tiny little pieces.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.115
That's gotta hurt.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.367
Yeah.
I hope it hurts a lot.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.370
Because sooner or later the message
sinks in. There is no safe place,

17:18.454 --> 17:21.164
not even a cafe. So if you
want to quit living through hell

17:21.249 --> 17:24.710
and dying over and over again,
then get the frak off our planet.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.921
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.048
Boom.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.472
NO. 6: His house
was on a bluff over a lake.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.600
I always loved the view.
The sunlight on the water.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.687
It's my favorite spot
in the universe.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.105
Yes, magical.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.274
Too bad you nuked it.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.364
After I downloaded, I went
back to the ruins of his house.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.574
Why?

17:56.367 --> 17:59.494
Like you, I was looking for
some sort of connection to him.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.252
Found a few of his things, even
held on to them for a while,

18:07.336 --> 18:10.630
but I realized they were keeping
me from truly embracing my new life.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.259
BOOMER:
So, what did you do with them?

18:17.138 --> 18:18.638
I burned them.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.312
But I felt liberated.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.814
Yeah, it's a beautiful story,
isn't it?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.442
A shame
it's all a pack of lies.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.531
So, who was he?
This man you loved?

18:40.578 --> 18:42.204
Maybe you've heard of him.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.206
Gaius Baltar.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.707
Doctor Baltar?

18:46.542 --> 18:47.626
Yeah.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.629
He gave you access
to the Colonial defense grid?

18:51.506 --> 18:53.423
He was the one
who betrayed us?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.342
"Us. " Oh, I love it.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.428
This one thinks
she's more human than Cylon.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.224
Just like someone else I know.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.435
Does he still work
for the Cylons?

19:05.561 --> 19:06.728
What?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.355
On Galactica?

19:09.607 --> 19:10.607
He's...

19:12.276 --> 19:13.401
He's alive?

19:13.736 --> 19:15.904
He's the Vice President
of the Colonies.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.240
You didn't know that?

19:29.502 --> 19:33.505
If the baby does survive, the
question is, what do we do with it?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.340
Do?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.511
What are you suggesting?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.137
That we throw it out
of an airlock?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.640
I don't make
suggestions, Mr. Baltar.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.685
If I want to toss a baby
out an airlock, I'd say so.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.688
Well, it's really gratifying to know
that infanticide is not on the table.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.023
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.191
It's a machine.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.944
No, it's half machine,
half human.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.488
I suggest we all
keep that half in mind.

19:58.573 --> 20:02.117
The Cylons went through a great
deal of trouble to create this thing.

20:03.202 --> 20:08.290
It should go without saying that if it's
good for them, it's gonna be bad for us.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.542
I completely agree.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.461
And I take it as a given, we can't
turn it over to Sharon to raise.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.422
That would be disastrous.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.966
ADAMA: There's still another
factor to consider here.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.385
There are Cylons
aboard this fleet.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.679
If they find out
this thing's been born,

20:22.763 --> 20:24.347
they're gonna
make a play for it.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.976
You can see
where this is headed, Gaius.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.770
We're gonna have to
take our child.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.406
BOOMER: Hello, Hera.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.242
(BOOMER EXCLAIMING)

20:44.327 --> 20:46.578
She's got quite a grip on her.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.874
You don't like it in there,
do you, Hera?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.127
You gotta stay until
your lungs get stronger.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.546
BOOMER:
Oh, she's our little girl.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.591
We made her.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.719
Almost makes you want to
believe in the Cylon God.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.265
Almost.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.439
I love you so completely.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.005
It's clear.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.552
Here, take these.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.222
Let's move!

21:56.399 --> 21:57.565
Here you go.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.951
Why do you think
they kept it from you?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.078
Is the wrong question.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.959
The right question is, why did
she get me to work with you,

22:16.043 --> 22:17.836
knowing that you'd
tell me the truth?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.587
She knew I had feelings
for Gaius.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.090
Knew that I had trouble
letting go of him.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.176
She must've known it would
trigger those feelings,

22:25.261 --> 22:26.511
and those memories.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.682
She's frakking with you,
can't you see that?

22:30.766 --> 22:31.725
But why?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.601
Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.520
You know, for self-aware
cybernetic life forms,

22:35.604 --> 22:37.313
sometimes you can be
unbearably obtuse.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.024
Oh, for God's sake!
BALTAR: Careful.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.442
Everything okay?

22:49.660 --> 22:50.785
Fine.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.538
Just talking with Sharon here.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.831
Yeah, what about?

22:57.752 --> 23:01.504
She asked me to move out.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.633
Ah, you know what? Which is what
we've been asking her for weeks.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.095
I was kind of hoping
that you'd see the light

23:09.180 --> 23:10.555
after talking
to our friend here.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.432
She is lying, unfortunately.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.810
She has no wish
to see Sharon cured.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.229
They're just gonna do it.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.648
They're going to box her.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.244
ANDERS: How many Cylons
up in the cafe?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.122
Full house. At least 40.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.917
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.424
We've just made
a breakthrough.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.510
She's agreed to move out
of her apartment.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.637
Didn't you, Sharon?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.139
Yeah.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.101
I'm moving out
of the apartment.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.811
When?

24:00.523 --> 24:01.815
Whenever.

24:04.527 --> 24:05.902
What about now?

24:06.529 --> 24:09.155
I'll help. The apartments
are right upstairs.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.657
Sure.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.662
Let me...
Let me just get some things.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.503
Good work, Six. Must
have been some chat, huh?

24:23.587 --> 24:25.338
Yes. We had a lot to talk about.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.215
She's right behind you.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.424
I know.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.236
(TIMER BEEPING)

24:50.781 --> 24:52.115
(DOOR OPENING)

25:08.257 --> 25:09.674
(METALLIC FOOTSTEPS)

26:07.024 --> 26:08.608
This is not a debate.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.402
This child will not
be raised by the Cylon,

26:11.487 --> 26:15.740
and I cannot risk Cylon agents getting
their hands on it. I've made my decision.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.868
What I need from you, Doctor,
is your help.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.038
Fine. I don't like it,
but have it your way.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.623
I need it immediately.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.792
We'll have to find
somebody suitable.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.835
I have to work up
a list of names.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.924
Each of them is capable, each of them
is anonymous, and each can be trusted.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.845
Thought of everything,
haven't you?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.681
I hope so.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.649
Are you all right, Sharon?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.652
(COUGHING)
What happened?

26:54.613 --> 26:55.905
Explosion.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.032
Building came down on us.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.287
Looks like
the stairwell saved us.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.038
Where's Six?

27:05.249 --> 27:06.916
Her body's dead.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.960
(GASPING) No, not yet.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.005
Help me out here.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.685
Would've been better if the
explosion had killed her.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.563
There's nothing we can do about
the pain until we get out of here.

27:34.236 --> 27:37.155
Hey, Six,
I can get a crossbeam

27:37.239 --> 27:38.990
and put you out
of your misery.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.576
I'm not gonna give up
on life again.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.455
It's your choice.

are we, anyway?

27:57.718 --> 27:59.427
Must be in the garage.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.013
The north entrance
might be that way.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.223
Then I'm gonna start digging.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.268

from down there.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.134
Thanks. I thought
I was a goner.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.265
Frakking human. You know, he
probably set that explosion.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.976
What, from the Resistance?
Why?

28:49.478 --> 28:51.354
No military value to the cafe.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.731
Humans don't respect life
the way we do.

28:53.816 --> 28:54.982
No!

28:56.276 --> 28:57.652
I won't let you kill him.

29:03.534 --> 29:04.742
She's right.

29:05.786 --> 29:06.911
Don't kill him.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.329
Why not?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.705
Hmm.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.835
Why not kill him?

29:15.212 --> 29:17.422
You've already killed
billions of people.

Do you honestly believe one more
body's gonna weigh any heavier

29:21.176 --> 29:22.593
on your conscience?

29:23.220 --> 29:25.388
Which is something
that you don't have.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.014
Do you?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.808
We should interrogate him.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.644
Find his accomplices.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.735
Okay.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.864
You can let go now, Sharon.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.224
She escaped with the help
of another Sharon.

this deeply about us.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.272
We did the best we could.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.982
But she's dead.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.150
And that's all
there is to it.

31:46.029 --> 31:50.783
I should be able to release
the ashes to you in a few hours.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.827
Murderer.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.664
HELO: Sharon! Sharon.
Die!

31:57.874 --> 31:59.083
(BOOMER SCREAMING)

32:00.877 --> 32:02.545
BOOMER: You're all murderers!

32:02.629 --> 32:04.422
MAN: Stay back!
You're all murderers!

32:04.506 --> 32:06.090
Get her out of here!

32:06.174 --> 32:07.425
Easy! Easy! Easy!

32:07.509 --> 32:09.260
(BOOMER SCREAMING)

33:22.751 --> 33:24.794
You let them murder our child.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.010
I am so sorry.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.263
I tried. I tried my best.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.767
God's will was that
our child should survive.

33:41.061 --> 33:44.605
His will was that she would lead the
next generation of God's children.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.194
His will was that
you would protect her.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.278
Yes.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.701
Listen, you have committed a
monstrous and unforgivable sin.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.454
And now you and your entire wretched
race are gonna suffer God's vengeance.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.799
She's so beautiful.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.217
(BABY GURGLING)

34:14.010 --> 34:15.886
I don't know
how to thank you.

34:17.305 --> 34:20.558
When I lost my baby, I
didn't know how I could go on.

34:20.809 --> 34:24.603
Well, I'm glad things worked
out for you and this little girl.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.982
I can't believe somebody would
give up this little angel.

34:28.358 --> 34:32.111
You understand, Maya, that this
adoption requires absolute secrecy.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.030
The mother is a Pegasus officer
and must remain anonymous

34:35.323 --> 34:37.408
for political
and religious reasons.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.659
You have my word.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.621
Maya, you won't mind
if I drop in occasionally?

34:43.165 --> 34:44.665
Oh, of course not.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.007
Good.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.427
Go.

35:07.773 --> 35:08.856
Thank you.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.026
I know how awful
this was for you,

35:12.110 --> 35:14.904
but trust me,
it was imperative.

35:15.822 --> 35:19.116
As far as the Cylons know,
this child no longer exists.

35:19.201 --> 35:22.453
That is a good, good thing.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.334
(GROANING)

35:34.758 --> 35:36.509
Is this what
you're looking for?

35:41.223 --> 35:42.473
You can have it.

35:42.766 --> 35:43.766
Here.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.937
What're you doing?

35:48.855 --> 35:51.398
Just making it easy for him
to get what he wants.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.071
Come on.
I'll give you a head start.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.657
I'm fine where I am.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.534
(CRASHING)

36:02.744 --> 36:06.413
Hey, they're coming for us
and you.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.500
They'll be
very interested in you.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.418
Leave him alone.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.795
Sharon,

36:14.840 --> 36:16.841
you're a hero of the Cylon.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.011
Now you're just a broken
machine who thinks she's a human.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.062
But you're not a human,
Sharon,

36:31.523 --> 36:33.023
and you never will be.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.609
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not a murderer.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.070
I have a conscience.

36:38.154 --> 36:41.282
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.621
A murderer is exactly
what you are.

36:53.628 --> 36:57.381
Life is short,
but the next one's not.

36:58.091 --> 37:02.553
Let your heart adrift
and your soul will get caught.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.054
I love you, Gaius.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.141
My heart and soul are yours.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.561
(CRASHING)

37:14.482 --> 37:15.816
They're nearly here.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.946
You know why they wanted you
to work with Sharon?

37:21.656 --> 37:23.282
So you'd lose your mind.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.659
They're gonna box you,
darling.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.912
Just like
they're gonna box Sharon.

37:30.540 --> 37:31.790
We're dangerous.

37:32.959 --> 37:33.959
What?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.377
Sharon and I.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.756
We're celebrities
in a culture based on unity.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.174
No.

37:42.844 --> 37:46.680
Our voices count. More than
hers. More than others'.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.767
We're two heroes
of the Cylon, right?

37:49.851 --> 37:52.311
Two heroes with different
perspectives on the war.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.439
Perspectives based on our
love of two human beings.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.024
(SNIFFLING)

37:57.150 --> 37:58.984
That's why she wanted me
to work with you,

37:59.069 --> 38:01.403
so that you'd tell me
that Gaius was still alive.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.323
And she wanted me
to lose my mind.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.788
No, you're corrupted
by your experiences.

38:16.086 --> 38:17.586
D'ANNA: You're a waste.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.048
Believe the lies,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.511
ignore the truth. Listen to
me, I will show you the proof.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.888
Speak from your heart.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.767
Say the things
that you know to be true.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.185
Genocide,

38:33.561 --> 38:37.314
murder, vengeance, they're
all sins in the eyes of God.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.650
That's what you and I know.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.069
That's what
they don't wanna hear.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.239
Because then they'd have to
rethink what they're doing.

38:46.241 --> 38:50.828
They'd have to consider that maybe
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!

38:50.912 --> 38:52.413
(CRASHING)

39:09.514 --> 39:10.764
God loves me.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.561
We'll see you again soon!

39:24.779 --> 39:25.779
Here.

39:29.576 --> 39:30.909
Looks like
they're almost here.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.245
You should get out
of here while you can.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.706
The fresh air coming in
might lead you out.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.332
Is this some kind of trick?

39:38.460 --> 39:40.544
You can stay and be tortured
if you want.

39:40.879 --> 39:41.879
Your call.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.508
(JACKHAMMERING)

39:51.556 --> 39:54.641
Who are you?
What kind of people are you?

39:55.643 --> 39:56.769
I don't know.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.567
BOOMER: Hey, wait.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.083
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?

40:19.459 --> 40:21.418
We had a lot of people
in the cafe.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.005
At least 36 hours
till they get to her.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.882
Long enough.

40:26.966 --> 40:27.966
Long enough for what?

40:28.343 --> 40:29.968
To change things
for the better.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.055
What are you talking about?

40:39.854 --> 40:44.650
I have never loved anyone
more in my life

40:46.319 --> 40:47.820
than I love you now.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.656
(JACKHAMMERING)

40:53.076 --> 40:55.119
Our people need
a new beginning.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.581
A new way to live
in God's love.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.503
Without hate.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.547
Without all the lies.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.135
All they need is for
someone to show them the way.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.846
Someone like two heroes
of the Cylons.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.599
(JACKHAMMERING)

41:27.527 --> 41:28.944
I'm with you.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.406
(RUMBLING)

41:36.578 --> 41:38.120
DORAL: We found them!

41:39.372 --> 41:40.664
They're alive!

41:40.748 --> 41:42.374
Yes, we are!

41:46.212 --> 41:47.462
We're alive.
