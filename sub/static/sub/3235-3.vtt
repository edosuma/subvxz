- You're so strong today!
- Marie, get out.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.834
I'm going to work.
Keep this party going!

00:13.913 --> 00:19.281
Walter White wants to buy my car wash,
the price he pays is 20 million dollars.

00:20.718 --> 00:23.419
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

00:23.531 --> 00:25.538
Get me in a room with him.

00:25.857 --> 00:27.000

I'm not leaving.

02:45.136 --> 02:47.504
Walt, I'm not leaving.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.774
Oh, my god.

02:58.115 --> 02:59.582
Ah.

02:59.616 --> 03:03.385
I can hear
your cell phone ringing!

03:05.187 --> 03:07.889
This is ridiculous.
I can't--

03:11.326 --> 03:12.292
Ah.

03:12.327 --> 03:15.062
Uh, what is going on with you?

03:15.096 --> 03:17.331
I've left you,
like, 23 messages.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.466
And?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.535
And?

03:20.569 --> 03:23.738
We need to
talk about the car wash.

03:23.772 --> 03:26.475
You know, Skyler, now is not
a good time for me, okay?

03:26.509 --> 03:27.810
Can we talk about this later?

03:27.844 --> 03:29.411
No, okay? We can't.

03:32.515 --> 03:33.949
Why are you do--

03:33.984 --> 03:36.418
Oh, Jesus.

03:36.453 --> 03:37.620
What happened?

03:37.654 --> 03:39.355
Nothing. I just
bumped it. That's all.

03:39.389 --> 03:41.857
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.

03:49.466 --> 03:53.770
Okay, exactly what happened?

03:53.805 --> 03:57.708
It's complicated, and I
don't wish to discuss it.

03:57.742 --> 03:58.775
It's none of your concern.

03:58.810 --> 03:59.876
Are you in danger?

04:01.446 --> 04:03.413
Uh--

04:03.448 --> 04:07.851
Walt, I need you
to look me in the eye

04:07.885 --> 04:10.921
and tell me right now,
are you in danger?

04:10.955 --> 04:12.289
You know what?

04:12.323 --> 04:15.725
Let's just say that I have
a hell of a lot more

04:15.760 --> 04:18.829
on my mind right now

04:18.863 --> 04:21.664
than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

04:21.697 --> 04:22.832
Okay.

04:22.867 --> 04:26.503
So if you could just please...

04:32.542 --> 04:35.377
Okay. Then we go
to the police.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.813
What?

04:37.848 --> 04:39.248
We-- We tell them
everything--

04:39.282 --> 04:42.852
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety,

04:42.886 --> 04:45.054
and-- And the safety of
your family-- Whoa. Whoa.

04:45.088 --> 04:46.055
And you need--
You need help.

04:46.089 --> 04:47.223
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:47.257 --> 04:48.291
What choice is there, Walt?

04:48.325 --> 04:49.325
What choice?

04:49.359 --> 04:50.559
If you're in danger--

04:50.594 --> 04:51.861
Then it would be
absolutely--

04:51.895 --> 04:53.796
Stop, stop, stop.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.898
You keep saying
that word, danger--

04:55.932 --> 04:57.766
- Danger.
- But you just said--

04:57.801 --> 04:59.368
No, and I have never
used that word.

04:59.403 --> 05:01.203
I said things were complicated,

05:01.237 --> 05:02.871
and then you flew
off the handle.

05:02.905 --> 05:06.808
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that, okay?

05:06.842 --> 05:08.543
Where'd that come from?
Hmm?

05:08.577 --> 05:10.444
A fall in the shower?

05:10.479 --> 05:15.550
Uh, this is just so
passive-aggressive, you know? I--

05:15.584 --> 05:17.619
Passive-aggressive?
Are y--

05:17.653 --> 05:18.887
I go two days

05:18.921 --> 05:20.622
without returning
your phone calls, two days,

05:20.656 --> 05:23.959
and I have one minor
little incident,

05:23.993 --> 05:25.528
and now
you're telling me to--

05:25.562 --> 05:27.964
I should turn myself in
to the police, for God's sake.

05:27.998 --> 05:29.332
- A minor little incident?
- Yes.

05:29.367 --> 05:32.469
What minor little incident?

05:32.504 --> 05:37.040
I had an argument
with a co-worker.

05:37.074 --> 05:38.641
Okay?

05:40.043 --> 05:41.410
And?

05:41.444 --> 05:43.445
I had an argument.

05:43.479 --> 05:45.413
We were in this bar,

05:45.448 --> 05:46.981
and we were discussing

05:47.015 --> 05:48.749
a particular business strategy,

05:48.784 --> 05:52.753
and-- And it got heated
and out of control,

05:52.787 --> 05:54.788
and he hit me-- Once.

05:54.823 --> 05:58.226
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.662
And that's it.

06:03.032 --> 06:05.767
You were in a bar fight?

06:08.104 --> 06:13.509
Yes, Skyler,
I was in a bar fight.

06:14.779 --> 06:16.546
So you're okay?

06:18.750 --> 06:20.017
Really?

06:24.290 --> 06:27.359
Yes. I'm okay.

06:29.129 --> 06:30.797
And I think in the end

06:30.831 --> 06:33.032
it may have been
a good thing, actually,

06:33.066 --> 06:35.067
because we were able
to clear the air

06:35.102 --> 06:37.670
and, you know, mutual respect.

06:38.973 --> 06:40.273
So--

06:41.908 --> 06:43.876
Frozen peas.

06:45.813 --> 06:47.313
What?

06:47.348 --> 06:48.915
It's the best thing
for the swelling.

06:48.949 --> 06:51.785
Oh, it-- It--
It's not really swollen.

06:51.819 --> 06:52.786
It's--

06:52.820 --> 06:53.853
No peas.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.523
You don't even have ice.

06:56.558 --> 06:59.092
I will get peas.
I will get ice.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.062
Peas and ice.
I'm writing it down.

07:02.698 --> 07:03.931
I, uh...

07:06.168 --> 07:08.937
I need you to...

07:08.971 --> 07:14.075
Promise me that if things
do get dangerous--

07:14.109 --> 07:16.311
promise me.

07:16.345 --> 07:18.146
Absolutely.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.049
So--

07:23.919 --> 07:25.386
Car wash.

07:41.235 --> 07:42.335
Charles?

07:50.910 --> 07:54.111
Hi, there. Can I
answer any questions?

07:54.146 --> 07:55.513
Yes.

07:55.547 --> 07:57.081
Any chance
of a top-off?

07:57.115 --> 07:59.984
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

08:07.359 --> 08:10.094
So what do you think?

08:10.129 --> 08:13.498
Oh. Very nice. Very open.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.801
Oh. I agree. It flows.

08:15.835 --> 08:17.803
A whole lot of natural light.

08:17.838 --> 08:19.605
Uh, Michael Kilbourne.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.307
Tori Costner.

08:21.341 --> 08:22.541
It's nice to meet you.

08:22.576 --> 08:24.844
Well, three bedrooms,
one and a half baths,

08:24.879 --> 08:26.413
on just under half an acre.

08:26.447 --> 08:29.383
That's a non-attached
casita out in back,

08:29.417 --> 08:32.719
permit usable as office
or guest suite.

08:32.754 --> 08:33.720
Hmm.

08:33.754 --> 08:34.988
Plank wood floors.

08:35.022 --> 08:36.322
Central heat and air.

08:36.357 --> 08:38.624
I--
I see you're married.

08:38.658 --> 08:41.760
No. Divorced, very recent.

08:41.794 --> 08:43.095
Old habits.

08:43.129 --> 08:44.096
Oh. I'm sorry.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.563
Any children?

08:45.598 --> 08:48.299
Yes. As a matter of fact,
a little boy.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.366
Oh. How old?

08:49.401 --> 08:50.834
Uh, he turned 4 in may.

08:50.869 --> 08:52.770
He's a gemini.
Would love this yard.

08:52.805 --> 08:55.106
Oh, well, plenty of space
for a jungle gym,

08:55.140 --> 08:57.976
and the neighborhood
preschool is fantastic.

08:58.010 --> 09:00.546
Oh, well, I think Eli
is going to be home-schooled.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.613
Oh, well, great.

09:01.648 --> 09:03.182
Not for religious reasons
or anything.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.450
I just want to make sure

09:04.485 --> 09:05.819
that he's getting
enough attention.

09:05.853 --> 09:07.387
He'll still go
to summer camp and whatnot,

09:07.421 --> 09:08.521
you know, play dates.

09:08.556 --> 09:10.257
I don't want him to be
socially awkward.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.026
Oh, no.
Makes a lot of sense.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.828
He tests very highly--

09:13.862 --> 09:15.329
96 percentile--

09:15.363 --> 09:16.797
But that whole
right brain, left brain--

09:16.831 --> 09:20.802
You want those in balance.

09:20.836 --> 09:25.773
You said the casita
has plumbing?

09:25.807 --> 09:27.208
I will go out with Clay,

09:27.242 --> 09:29.810
so I need access
to running water.

09:29.844 --> 09:32.346
Well, it's pipe fitted
for a quarter bath,

09:32.380 --> 09:34.748
so make a perfect studio.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.949
Hmm.

09:38.053 --> 09:39.887
This could work.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.692
<i>Hell, that's the doctor's plan</i>

09:43.726 --> 09:44.960
<i>to get her patients at ease,</i>

09:44.994 --> 09:47.696
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

09:47.731 --> 09:49.331
<i>But, nurse, I'm not one--</i>

09:49.366 --> 09:51.400
Hello! I'm back!

09:53.103 --> 09:54.069
Hank?

09:54.104 --> 09:55.104
Yeah.

10:01.443 --> 10:03.010
Ohh.

10:03.044 --> 10:05.846
I had to go
to three different places

10:05.880 --> 10:07.313
to get the moisturizer
that you like,

10:07.348 --> 10:08.547
but I got that,

10:08.582 --> 10:12.618
and I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips,

10:12.652 --> 10:15.054
and I couldn't resist.

10:17.524 --> 10:21.293
<i>The complete encyclopedia
to fantasy football.</i>

10:21.328 --> 10:22.862
Look, it has
all the latest rankings.

10:22.896 --> 10:25.964
Marie, I said Cheetos,
not Fritos.

10:25.999 --> 10:28.200
W-wait. Uh--

10:28.234 --> 10:30.636
I must have said Cheetos,
like, ten times.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.471
You need me to write it
down for you?

10:32.505 --> 10:33.739
No, and I don't need you

10:33.773 --> 10:35.473
to be mean about it,
either, Mr. grumpy.

10:35.508 --> 10:36.741
Well, I'm just saying,
you know.

10:36.775 --> 10:39.143
I said Cheetos.
Ch-ch-ch sound,

10:39.177 --> 10:42.612
virtually impossible to
confuse Cheetos with Fritos,

10:42.647 --> 10:43.613
it seems to me.

10:43.647 --> 10:44.747
Where are you going?

10:44.782 --> 10:47.150
Uh, back to the store, I guess.

10:48.785 --> 10:49.785
Here.

10:50.854 --> 10:52.288
And the draft's
not for two months,

10:52.322 --> 10:53.689
so this is useless.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.123
Can you believe it?

11:10.627 --> 11:11.627
What?

11:12.662 --> 11:15.030
What? This.

11:19.002 --> 11:22.471
Well, you always thought
this place could be bugged.

11:22.505 --> 11:23.739
Now we know.

11:23.774 --> 11:26.976
Yeah, well, I don't like it.

11:27.011 --> 11:29.079
It's a violation
of the work space.

11:30.915 --> 11:32.382
Yeah, I guess.

11:33.618 --> 11:35.252
Want to do something?

11:37.222 --> 11:39.956
Do something?
Like what?

11:41.992 --> 11:44.160
Go-karts?

11:46.296 --> 11:48.097
Go-karts? What--

11:48.132 --> 11:53.268
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

11:53.302 --> 11:55.070
It's pretty fun.

11:59.075 --> 12:00.042
No.

12:00.076 --> 12:03.545
Actually, I have--

12:03.580 --> 12:06.482
I have a meeting, so--

12:06.517 --> 12:07.884
All right. Whatever.

12:12.257 --> 12:13.524
Rain check?

12:13.558 --> 12:15.526
Yeah, sure.

12:21.868 --> 12:23.902
How you doing?

12:25.238 --> 12:26.572
Good.

12:26.606 --> 12:27.606
Yeah?

12:29.476 --> 12:30.476
You okay?

12:32.678 --> 12:36.747
Is there, uh, anything
we should talk about?

12:41.920 --> 12:43.453
How's your eye?

12:46.356 --> 12:48.691
Yeah, it's fine.

12:48.725 --> 12:52.761
Anything we should talk about?

13:00.204 --> 13:01.805
For what it's worth...

13:02.940 --> 13:05.142
Getting the shit
kicked out of you...

13:06.578 --> 13:10.280
Not to say you, uh,
you get used to it, but...

13:11.416 --> 13:13.717
You do kind of get used to it.

13:27.263 --> 13:29.664
Two words-- Nail salon.

13:29.699 --> 13:32.066
It's perfect
for money laundering.

13:32.101 --> 13:34.168
It's a high volume
cash-preferred business

13:34.203 --> 13:35.537
with a discreet work force.

13:35.571 --> 13:38.506
I mean, nobody does
"mister, me know nothing"

13:38.541 --> 13:40.776
better than Mrs.
Mookjaiaporn and her gals.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.378
Mr. Goodman--

13:42.412 --> 13:44.547
Saul, please. Now,

13:44.581 --> 13:46.115
for the lady
of the house--

13:46.150 --> 13:47.818
Drum roll, please--

13:47.852 --> 13:49.119
how about a lifetime supply

13:49.153 --> 13:51.021
of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

13:51.055 --> 13:52.656
Ah, yeah. Go ahead,
pinch yourself.

13:52.690 --> 13:53.824
Ha ha ha!

13:53.858 --> 13:56.527
We're not buying
a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.

13:56.561 --> 13:58.328
We're getting the car wash.

13:58.363 --> 14:00.531
I'm sorry. Am I missing
something here?

14:00.565 --> 14:02.599
I mean, didn't you
already try that?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.968
Yeah. I mean,
Walt told me

14:05.002 --> 14:07.770
that you, uh, took a run
at this Bogdan character,

14:07.804 --> 14:09.405
and he wrestled you
into submission

14:09.439 --> 14:10.506
with his eyebrows.

14:10.540 --> 14:13.474
10 million, that was the
asking price, right?

14:13.509 --> 14:15.844
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

14:15.878 --> 14:17.779
Ha ho! Nice negotiating.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.882
Yeah. I-- Hey, you bombed.
It happens.

14:20.916 --> 14:23.017
You were smart to call me.

14:23.052 --> 14:26.287
Now-- Uh,
you just sit back, relax,

14:26.322 --> 14:28.356
and let a professional
take over.

14:28.390 --> 14:29.390
Who is that?

14:29.424 --> 14:31.558
That's for me. Excuse me.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.664
What do you want?
I'm in a meeting.

14:37.698 --> 14:40.299
Why didn't you
think of that before?

14:40.334 --> 14:41.567
It's not my--

14:41.601 --> 14:43.335
I'm in a meeting.

14:45.772 --> 14:48.173
Can Huell use your bathroom?

14:49.308 --> 14:51.410
Huell?

14:51.444 --> 14:54.646
Uh, sure.
The top of the stairs.

14:54.681 --> 14:56.048
He'll be quick.

14:59.419 --> 15:01.219
It's a stomach thing.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.521
So where were we?

15:03.556 --> 15:05.857
Professionalism.

15:05.892 --> 15:09.227
Yeah. Um, so the guy
won't sell, he won't sell.

15:09.261 --> 15:10.796
I don't accept that.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.598
I don't accept
that he won't sell.

15:12.632 --> 15:15.033
I-- I think he just
lacks the proper...

15:16.269 --> 15:17.670
Motivation.

15:17.704 --> 15:20.005
Motivation. Oh. Uh,

15:20.040 --> 15:24.844
as in "motivation" motivation?

15:24.878 --> 15:26.579
I mean, just so we're
on the same page here.

15:26.613 --> 15:29.448
You're saying we make him
an offer he can't refuse?

15:29.483 --> 15:32.118
Nothing so dramatic
as that, no.

15:32.152 --> 15:33.720
Motivation.

15:36.357 --> 15:38.458
Attitude adjustment.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.995
Ho ho ho ho!

15:41.029 --> 15:44.299
This one, she's a keeper.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.902
Well, an audit can be
highly motivating.

15:46.936 --> 15:48.770
I know a gal
over at tax and revenue.

15:48.805 --> 15:49.938
You give her ten minutes

15:49.973 --> 15:51.106
on this Bogdan fella's books,

15:51.141 --> 15:52.708
she'll have his sky
raining frogs.

15:52.742 --> 15:56.578
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

15:56.612 --> 15:58.313
We don't want them
looking at us

15:58.347 --> 15:59.614
after Bogdan sells.

15:59.649 --> 16:02.685
All right. How about
an I.C.E. raid?

16:02.719 --> 16:04.620
You know he's got illegals
working over there.

16:04.654 --> 16:06.121
I mean, he just has to.

16:06.155 --> 16:09.257
We are not getting a bunch of poor
innocent people in trouble, no.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.425
Yeah. And also, you're
going to need them

16:11.460 --> 16:13.160
after you take over.
Tck.

16:14.228 --> 16:16.797
Hey. How about terrorism?

16:18.033 --> 16:20.100
"Oh, agent Hoover,
I got to tell you,

16:20.134 --> 16:22.970
"I've seen some real
islamic comings and goings

16:23.004 --> 16:24.371
over there at the car wash."

16:24.405 --> 16:26.874
Yeah, I mean guys in turbans
pulling up in vans

16:26.909 --> 16:28.943
and stuff like that. Ha ha!

16:28.978 --> 16:32.147
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

16:32.182 --> 16:36.586
Okay, well, we're-- We're
just spitballing here, so...

16:36.620 --> 16:39.690
Okay, there's always...

16:40.859 --> 16:43.995
"You got
a real nice place here.

16:44.029 --> 16:45.463
A shame if something
happened to it."

16:45.497 --> 16:46.864
That angle.

16:46.899 --> 16:50.168
What are you talking about?

16:50.203 --> 16:52.037
Violence?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.740
Attitude adjustment.

16:55.775 --> 16:57.108
Oh, no. That? No.

16:57.143 --> 16:58.776
That is not at all
what I meant.

16:58.811 --> 17:00.478
I-- We do not do that.

17:00.513 --> 17:01.980
That's not who we are,

17:02.014 --> 17:03.081
right?

17:03.115 --> 17:05.082
Yeah. No. No.

17:05.117 --> 17:07.084
No, she-- She's right.

17:07.118 --> 17:10.488
Look, do I need
to state the obvious?

17:10.521 --> 17:12.022
I mean, there's got to be

17:12.057 --> 17:15.627
dozens of car washes
in this area.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.695
Who says it has to be this one?

17:17.730 --> 17:19.865
I do.

17:19.898 --> 17:21.767
I say it has to.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.902
Why?

17:24.938 --> 17:26.205
I just do.

17:28.009 --> 17:29.243
God.

17:30.445 --> 17:31.912
Well, that clears things up.

17:33.215 --> 17:35.549
I don't like him--
Bogdan.

17:35.584 --> 17:38.019
He was condescending
to me, rude about you,

17:38.053 --> 17:40.121
and I do not like him.

17:40.155 --> 17:41.622
Simple as that.

17:42.857 --> 17:46.327
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman

17:46.361 --> 17:47.861
more than I do,

17:47.896 --> 17:50.531
but, uh, in this business,

17:50.565 --> 17:52.333
and Walt can
back me up on this,

17:52.367 --> 17:54.202
the number 1 rule is--

17:54.236 --> 17:55.870
Don't take things personally.

17:55.905 --> 17:59.340
What do you-- What do you
mean, rude about me?

18:03.445 --> 18:07.081
Something along the lines of...

18:07.116 --> 18:10.718
You weren't man enough
to face him yourself.

18:10.753 --> 18:12.087
What?

18:12.121 --> 18:14.489
That you had to send your woman

18:14.523 --> 18:16.290
to do your business for you.

18:17.927 --> 18:20.228
Okay, uh, speaking
as your lawyer,

18:20.262 --> 18:21.496
I'm going to go on record

18:21.530 --> 18:22.964
and say this is a bad idea.

18:22.998 --> 18:24.031
Now, I advise against--

18:24.065 --> 18:25.265
It's this one.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.575
Okay. So, uh...

18:36.378 --> 18:37.579
All we have to do

18:37.613 --> 18:39.982
is think of a nonviolent,

18:40.016 --> 18:42.985
unsuspicious way
to purchase the car wash

18:43.020 --> 18:45.154
that-- That--
That protects the innocent

18:45.189 --> 18:48.891
and doesn't cost $20 million.

18:51.162 --> 18:53.597
Don't everybody speak at once.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.148
Hi.

19:11.182 --> 19:13.416
Can I answer any questions?

19:13.451 --> 19:14.885
Oh. Spoons.

19:14.919 --> 19:17.487
Yes. The owner
is quite the collector.

19:17.522 --> 19:18.655
Aren't they something?

19:18.689 --> 19:20.591
One for each of the 50 states.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.793
Uh, Puerto Rico is
technically a territory.

19:23.828 --> 19:25.996
Huh.

19:26.030 --> 19:28.698
You know, maybe they
were thinking...

19:28.732 --> 19:30.867
Some day.

19:30.901 --> 19:34.270
Uh, so no basement.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.905
No basement. Sorry.

19:35.939 --> 19:38.641
That's a problem.
My brother's in the peace corps,

19:38.676 --> 19:40.110
and won't be back
for 18 months,

19:40.144 --> 19:43.212
and I said I'd hang
on to his furniture.

19:43.247 --> 19:44.914
Well, if you're looking
for storage space,

19:44.948 --> 19:46.515
there's an attic area
that's sizeable.

19:46.550 --> 19:50.452
Oh. Huh. Well, an attic
might be even better,

19:50.487 --> 19:51.587
as long as it's dry.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.055
- Let's take a tour.
- Okay.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.692
Actually, I have
a handout for you.

20:01.432 --> 20:03.299
It has all the information.

20:03.334 --> 20:05.034
I'm Stephanie Doswell,
by the way.

20:05.069 --> 20:06.670
Charlotte Blattner.

20:06.704 --> 20:07.937
So nice to meet you, Charlotte.

20:07.972 --> 20:09.339
You, too.

20:09.373 --> 20:10.974
So I just told him
point-blank--

20:11.008 --> 20:13.243
"You're my husband,
and I love you.

20:13.277 --> 20:15.612
"But you're 53 years old.

20:15.647 --> 20:19.048
"This job has just
gotten too stressful"

20:19.083 --> 20:21.851
and difficult,
and it's time to quit.

20:21.885 --> 20:25.154
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

20:25.188 --> 20:26.956
Still, what
a fascinating career

20:26.990 --> 20:28.557
that must have been for him.

20:28.591 --> 20:30.825
It was. I mean,

20:30.859 --> 20:33.561
NASA was like
a second family to us,

20:33.596 --> 20:36.197
but, you know,

20:36.232 --> 20:37.966
it was time
for a new adventure,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.769
so, between his pension

20:40.803 --> 20:43.005
and the income I bring in
from hand modeling,

20:43.039 --> 20:45.240
we're, you know, comfortable.

20:45.275 --> 20:47.443
Uh, when were these
floors redone?

20:47.477 --> 20:48.677
Two years ago,

20:48.712 --> 20:50.145
and the counters are brand new.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.047
I can tell. Travertine.

20:52.082 --> 20:53.848
Hmm.
Nice.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.350
Any children?

20:55.384 --> 20:56.852
No.

20:56.886 --> 21:00.021
I don't really want kids.

21:00.056 --> 21:02.357
Is that horrible for me
to say, do you think?

21:02.391 --> 21:04.860
Not at all. Not everyone
has to have children.

21:04.894 --> 21:07.629
Hmm. You should
talk to my husband.

21:07.663 --> 21:10.098
Uh, garbage disposal?

21:10.132 --> 21:11.266
Mm-hmm.

21:48.335 --> 21:49.735
Aah!

22:23.139 --> 22:24.106
Check it out.

22:24.140 --> 22:25.474
Score, yo.

23:35.358 --> 23:38.427
I really love your home.

23:38.461 --> 23:39.628
Well, thank you, Mimi.

23:39.662 --> 23:43.632
It has a...
Very European feel.

23:43.667 --> 23:44.733
You think?

23:44.768 --> 23:46.335
Oh, I lived in London
for years,

23:46.370 --> 23:49.105
so yeah, this feels familiar.

23:49.139 --> 23:50.539
Where in London?

23:50.574 --> 23:53.609
I was stationed at Upwood
in the '60s.

23:53.643 --> 23:54.544
Right downtown.

23:54.578 --> 23:56.079
But we were almost never there.

23:56.113 --> 23:58.414
My husband is an illustrator,
so we traveled a lot--

23:58.449 --> 24:00.116
Paris, Italy, Denmark.

24:00.151 --> 24:01.785
It was before the kids
were in school,

24:01.820 --> 24:03.587
so it was easy
to pick up and go.

24:03.622 --> 24:05.423
That was before
my youngest, Lucy,

24:05.457 --> 24:07.358
was diagnosed
with endocarditis.

24:07.393 --> 24:08.860
Oh, my.

24:08.894 --> 24:10.262
Gosh, is that, uh--

24:10.296 --> 24:12.631
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.001
It's-- Yeah, it can be--

24:15.035 --> 24:17.303
Mmm. That's terrible.

24:17.338 --> 24:19.039
Is she all right?

24:20.575 --> 24:22.309
Your daughter.

24:22.343 --> 24:23.910
Is she okay?

24:23.945 --> 24:26.046
Yes. Th-thank you.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.048
Um, the doctor's put her
on a prosthetic valve,

24:29.083 --> 24:30.783
so she's-- Lucy's fine.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.786
Running and walking,
riding horses.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.254
Well, thank goodness.

24:35.288 --> 24:38.624
Yeah. We're...Very lucky.

24:38.658 --> 24:39.825
Yeah.

24:44.631 --> 24:46.532
Excuse me. Miss?

24:46.566 --> 24:48.367
Very nice. Thank you!

24:48.402 --> 24:50.236
I just called the police.

24:50.270 --> 24:51.270
Okay, then.

24:51.304 --> 24:53.506
I know you stole that spoon.

24:53.541 --> 24:56.476
What spoon? What are you
talking about?

24:56.511 --> 24:57.578
You're a thief.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.447
Excuse me?

25:00.482 --> 25:01.348
And a liar,

25:01.383 --> 25:02.683
making stories up
about yourself.

25:02.717 --> 25:03.851
What's wrong with you?

25:03.885 --> 25:05.619
No. What's the matter
with you, lady?

25:05.654 --> 25:08.722
You better just back off, okay?

25:08.756 --> 25:11.524
My husband is a DEA agent.

25:11.559 --> 25:14.027
I thought he was an astronaut
or an illustrator.

25:14.061 --> 25:15.795
You better get your
crazy lies straight.

25:15.829 --> 25:17.096
You know what, fatty?

25:17.130 --> 25:20.665
You are so lucky that I
am late for an appointment.

25:20.699 --> 25:21.866
You're not going anywhere.

25:21.901 --> 25:22.867
Hey, my purse.

25:22.902 --> 25:24.336
Not until the police get here.

25:24.371 --> 25:26.638
Let go of it! Let it go!

25:26.673 --> 25:27.907
Let it go!

25:27.941 --> 25:29.308
Let it...Go!

25:36.884 --> 25:40.655
You are in big trouble.

25:50.765 --> 25:51.832
Yeah.

25:55.269 --> 25:57.371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:57.405 --> 25:58.405
Just sl--

25:58.439 --> 26:00.007
Slow down. Start from the--

26:00.041 --> 26:01.041
You--

26:02.209 --> 26:03.376
You're where?

26:06.814 --> 26:08.849
Why the f--

26:08.883 --> 26:10.083
Why are you--

26:16.991 --> 26:21.695
Are you seriously
doing this to me again?

26:26.301 --> 26:28.102
Jesus, just st--

26:33.142 --> 26:34.911
Would you stop crying?

26:42.085 --> 26:44.954
I'll make a phone call.
Just sit tight.

26:48.391 --> 26:50.425
Where do they got you?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.669
So good news. The officer
spoke to the homeowners,

27:01.703 --> 27:03.204
and they're not
going to press charges.

27:03.238 --> 27:05.373
Good. I won't, either.

27:05.408 --> 27:08.877
Okay, then,
so we're good to go.

27:10.914 --> 27:12.181
You ready?

27:20.258 --> 27:21.926
Marie, you want to go home?

27:31.270 --> 27:32.303
Marie?

28:30.695 --> 28:32.296
Yes, it's Skyler White

28:32.330 --> 28:34.131
calling for Saul Goodman,
please.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.834
Yes, it is important.

28:36.869 --> 28:38.403
Thank you.

28:52.184 --> 28:54.718
Sorry. Same as before.

28:54.753 --> 28:56.687
But this is not right.

28:56.721 --> 28:59.356
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

28:59.390 --> 29:00.991
Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked
your waste water

29:01.025 --> 29:02.158
inside and out.

29:02.193 --> 29:03.560
I've checked
your runoff gutters,

29:03.595 --> 29:06.130
and now out here
more contaminants--

29:06.164 --> 29:08.098
Ammonia, acetone,

29:08.133 --> 29:10.001
benzene, nitrobenzene.

29:10.035 --> 29:12.003
No, no, no.
This is a mistake.

29:12.037 --> 29:13.838
Where is Gary?
He will tell you

29:13.873 --> 29:15.875
my soap is very good,
very green.

29:15.909 --> 29:17.276
No, your soap is not the issue.

29:17.310 --> 29:18.778
It's your filtration system.

29:18.812 --> 29:21.214
At the very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

29:21.248 --> 29:23.683
But if you're leeching
into the ground water,

29:23.717 --> 29:26.619
which is looking like
a real possibility here,

29:26.654 --> 29:29.121
you're going to need to
replace your system entirely.

29:29.156 --> 29:32.024
Replace? Do you know
how much cost that is?

29:32.059 --> 29:33.459
$200,000.

29:33.494 --> 29:35.295
Look, I understand
it's a hardship.

29:35.329 --> 29:38.431
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

29:38.466 --> 29:40.133
If you get going immediately,

29:40.167 --> 29:41.601
your down time
shouldn't be any more

29:41.635 --> 29:42.736
than four or five weeks.

29:42.770 --> 29:45.405
Okay. So sorry. You're right.

29:45.440 --> 29:48.808
From now on,
we will be extra careful

29:48.843 --> 29:51.144
and, uh, clean.

29:51.178 --> 29:52.579
No more pollution, okay?

29:52.614 --> 29:54.181
- Yes?
- No, I'm sorry.

29:54.215 --> 29:55.649
The state requires you

29:55.683 --> 29:57.484
to suspend
all commercial activity

29:57.519 --> 29:59.987
until these levels reach
the mandated minimums.

30:01.223 --> 30:02.790
Where is usual man?
Where is Gary?

30:02.824 --> 30:04.692
He got transferred
to Las Cruces.

30:04.726 --> 30:06.827
If you'd like to file an
appeal, you can contact--

30:06.861 --> 30:08.762
I have done nothing wrong.

30:08.797 --> 30:10.730
Tell me, why you shut me down?

30:10.765 --> 30:12.132
What laws did I break?

30:12.166 --> 30:13.200
What laws? Several.

30:13.234 --> 30:15.802
Tell me exact specific laws,
or I refuse.

30:15.836 --> 30:16.837
- Specific?
- Right now.

30:16.871 --> 30:18.205
The--

30:18.239 --> 30:19.406
Tell me exact--

30:19.440 --> 30:20.540
- The specific laws--
- What laws?

30:20.575 --> 30:21.575
<i>Hold on, okay?</i>

30:21.609 --> 30:22.576
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

30:22.610 --> 30:23.643
Wait, wait, wait.

30:23.678 --> 30:25.212
Okay. Okay.

30:25.246 --> 30:28.581
The New Mexico
hazardous waste act of 1978,

30:28.616 --> 30:30.850
section 74, chapter 4,

30:30.885 --> 30:34.587
part 13 states, "whenever
the disposal of solid waste

30:34.622 --> 30:36.155
or hazardous waste presents--"

30:36.190 --> 30:38.425
An imminent
or substantial endangerment,

30:38.459 --> 30:42.429
the offender may be fined
not more than $5,000

30:42.463 --> 30:44.130
each day in which
the violation occurs.

30:44.164 --> 30:45.665
All right. Okay.

30:45.699 --> 30:48.501
Now the...

30:48.535 --> 30:51.070
Okay. Okay, baby.

30:51.105 --> 30:55.775
All right.
The EPA can cite him

30:55.809 --> 30:58.378
under the toxic
substances--

30:58.412 --> 31:00.613
Control act of 1976,

31:00.647 --> 31:02.615
U.S. code title 15,

31:02.649 --> 31:03.849
chapter 53--

31:03.883 --> 31:05.050
Subchapter 1--

31:05.084 --> 31:07.553
Section 2606.

31:08.855 --> 31:10.155
Satisfied?

31:11.859 --> 31:13.626
Was that specific--

31:13.660 --> 31:14.894
Enough for you?

31:33.561 --> 31:34.794
All done with lunch?

31:34.829 --> 31:35.862
Hmm.

31:37.932 --> 31:40.233
You hardly touched this.

31:40.267 --> 31:41.902
I'm not hungry.

31:43.137 --> 31:44.271
Well...

31:45.706 --> 31:47.474
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

31:48.576 --> 31:50.143
I'm not hungry, Marie.

31:50.177 --> 31:51.544
So don't eat it.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.736
Hey, Marie.
How you doing?

32:17.770 --> 32:20.873
I-- I'm okay.
Is there a problem?

32:20.907 --> 32:23.176
No, no.
Everything's fine.

32:23.210 --> 32:25.077
I'm here for Hank, actually.

32:25.112 --> 32:27.648
Oh. You're so sweet.

32:27.682 --> 32:29.283
Hank will be thrilled.

32:40.929 --> 32:43.531
Sweetie, you have a visitor.

32:45.100 --> 32:48.202
Ah, Jesus.
What now?

32:48.237 --> 32:49.437
She rob a bank?

32:49.471 --> 32:51.205
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

32:51.239 --> 32:54.741
Oh, well,

32:54.776 --> 32:56.043
can't complain, you know.

32:56.077 --> 32:57.344
Every day a little better.

32:57.379 --> 32:59.580
That's good.
You're looking good.

32:59.614 --> 33:02.516
Yeah, well, handsome
was never the hard part.

33:03.518 --> 33:05.485
Come on in.
Grab a seat.

33:06.587 --> 33:08.821
Yeah, just throw
that stuff anywhere.

33:12.159 --> 33:13.560
Listen, uh...

33:13.594 --> 33:16.096
Thanks again for the other day.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.931
You know, this--
This whole thing,

33:17.965 --> 33:21.235
it's, uh,
it's been hard on her.

33:21.269 --> 33:23.738
Forget it. Glad to help.

33:25.641 --> 33:28.510
So, rock collecting?

33:28.544 --> 33:30.812
They're minerals. Yeah.

33:30.847 --> 33:33.648
Uh, it's cataloging them--

33:33.682 --> 33:35.450
Sort them, label them.

33:35.484 --> 33:38.152
Um, it's actually
a lot of work.

33:38.186 --> 33:40.988
Yeah?
No, it looks like it.

33:42.957 --> 33:45.158
So, what's up?

33:45.192 --> 33:49.929
Well, actually, I could use
your help on something.

33:49.963 --> 33:52.265
Homicide,
possibly drug-related.

33:52.299 --> 33:54.901
You want my help on the case?

33:54.935 --> 33:56.670
What am I, Ironside?

33:56.704 --> 33:59.740
No. But you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent,

33:59.774 --> 34:01.809
and you're a pal
I just did a favor for,

34:01.844 --> 34:03.511
so let me pick your brain
a second.

34:03.545 --> 34:04.779
You ever come across a guy

34:04.814 --> 34:06.414
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

34:07.817 --> 34:09.016
No.

34:09.052 --> 34:11.687
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

34:12.922 --> 34:13.922
Okay.

34:13.956 --> 34:15.891
No signs of forced entry,

34:15.925 --> 34:17.493
no signs of robbery.

34:17.527 --> 34:20.195
Okay, so it's
a crime of passion.

34:20.230 --> 34:22.498
Where's the drug angle?

34:22.532 --> 34:25.601
We found a notebook
at his place.

34:25.635 --> 34:28.402
I made a copy for you
in case your interested.

34:28.438 --> 34:30.239
Looks like it pertains

34:30.273 --> 34:33.576
to some kind of
methamphetamine superlab.

34:33.610 --> 34:34.877
Ah.

34:34.911 --> 34:37.112
It's filled with
scientific formulas

34:37.146 --> 34:39.447
and chemical purchase lists...

34:39.482 --> 34:42.685
Drawings, pages
and pages of this stuff.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.487
It looks big time,
but I'm no authority,

34:45.522 --> 34:47.922
so I wonder if you
might take a look.

34:49.525 --> 34:52.594
Come on, Tim, seriously.

34:52.628 --> 34:54.963
What is this, some kind
of a charity thing?

34:54.996 --> 34:57.865
I thought your expertise
could be useful here.

34:57.899 --> 35:01.068
I'm lying here
like, uh, third base,

35:01.102 --> 35:03.736
living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

35:03.771 --> 35:06.038
I'm not even useful to myself.

35:07.674 --> 35:09.608
Want my advice?

35:09.643 --> 35:11.978
Take this to Steve Gomez.

35:12.012 --> 35:13.113
He'll help you out.

35:13.147 --> 35:15.548
I give this to Steve Gomez,

35:15.583 --> 35:17.617
and all of a sudden
it becomes a DEA case.

35:17.652 --> 35:19.920
What good does that do me?

35:19.954 --> 35:23.324
If you could just take a look,

35:23.358 --> 35:25.693
tell me what I got here,

35:25.727 --> 35:27.361
I'd really appreciate it.

35:31.401 --> 35:32.667
Eh.

35:34.637 --> 35:35.870
Whatever.

35:39.608 --> 35:40.908
Thanks, man.

35:42.010 --> 35:43.777
You take it easy.

35:43.811 --> 35:45.178
That's what I do.

36:26.890 --> 36:30.059
Well, it was a good try.

36:34.699 --> 36:37.434
Here we go.
Time for your nap. Yeah.

36:37.468 --> 36:39.302
Oh, you're good.

36:45.010 --> 36:46.310
So...

36:48.046 --> 36:50.148
Nail salon sounded promising.

36:50.182 --> 36:51.883
What do you think?

36:51.917 --> 36:54.118
I think we wait.

36:54.153 --> 36:55.786
Wait.

36:55.821 --> 36:59.456
Skyler, it has been five hours.

36:59.491 --> 37:00.824
He'll call.

37:00.859 --> 37:02.192
Ahem. Just wait.

37:02.227 --> 37:03.461
Just wait.

37:03.495 --> 37:04.762
Look.

37:06.798 --> 37:09.567
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea.

37:09.601 --> 37:10.734
But it didn't work.

37:10.769 --> 37:12.669
So why don't we
simply chalk it up

37:12.704 --> 37:15.673
as a learning--

37:21.646 --> 37:23.347
White residence.

37:24.683 --> 37:26.584
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

37:27.586 --> 37:29.420
Am I still interested?

37:29.455 --> 37:32.057
Well, I--
I think that depends.

37:32.092 --> 37:35.261
Yes, 879
was the original offer,

37:35.295 --> 37:37.597
but that seems high to me now.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.332
Now I'm offering 800.

37:39.366 --> 37:40.700
No, no, no. No, no.
Don't do that.

37:40.735 --> 37:42.335
- Why?
- Don't do that.

37:42.370 --> 37:44.504
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person,

37:44.539 --> 37:46.273
Mr. Wolynetz.
You were rude to me

37:46.307 --> 37:47.742
and disrespectful
towards my husband.

37:47.776 --> 37:49.177
- Skyler--
- And furthermore,

37:49.211 --> 37:51.379
I've met with quite
a number of sellers,

37:51.414 --> 37:53.682
and the market seems
much softer than I thought.

37:53.716 --> 37:55.750
So 800.

37:55.785 --> 37:57.552
<i>You are talking crazy.
800?</i>

37:57.587 --> 37:58.820
Uh-huh.

37:58.854 --> 38:00.922
<i>You are a very,
very crazy lady.</i>

38:00.956 --> 38:03.224
Well, I understand
that you're disappointed,

38:03.259 --> 38:05.026
but that is my final offer.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.762
I'm sorry we couldn't
make it work.

38:07.797 --> 38:08.830
Goodbye.

38:10.165 --> 38:12.833
What are you doing?

38:12.868 --> 38:14.735
I'm negotiating.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.770
Why?

38:16.804 --> 38:18.338
Because I want to pay less.

38:18.373 --> 38:19.606
Oh, now--

38:19.640 --> 38:22.742
$79,000 less?

38:22.776 --> 38:25.211
Who cares? Do you know
how much I make in a day?

38:25.245 --> 38:27.346
Yeah, but that's
the very reason

38:27.380 --> 38:28.580
we need to negotiate.

38:28.614 --> 38:30.081
We don't want
to arouse suspicion

38:30.116 --> 38:31.749
by not trying
to get a good deal.

38:31.784 --> 38:34.218
Look, I get the logic.
I do.

38:34.253 --> 38:36.855
But you just went
too far with it.

38:36.889 --> 38:38.356
You're calling him names?

38:38.390 --> 38:39.991
I didn't call him names.
Ohh.

38:40.025 --> 38:41.359
I said he was unpleasant.

38:42.394 --> 38:43.994
Ohh...

38:45.397 --> 38:47.965
Well,
he's not calling you back.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.337
I mean, you didn't honestly
think that worked.

38:53.639 --> 38:56.141
Yeah, I do.

38:56.176 --> 38:57.443
Oh.

38:57.477 --> 38:59.411
No way. Sorry. No.

38:59.446 --> 39:01.013
- So--
- Ahem.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.416
It's time to move on, okay?

39:03.450 --> 39:05.351
I'm going to call Saul.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.353
Where's my phone?

39:27.107 --> 39:28.107
Wait.

39:28.141 --> 39:29.108
No.

39:29.142 --> 39:30.542
- What?
- No, just...

39:30.577 --> 39:31.577
- Wait, wait.
- What for?

39:31.611 --> 39:32.611
Wait, wait.

39:32.646 --> 39:33.679
For--

39:35.949 --> 39:38.718
Oh, my God.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.821
Hello.

39:43.557 --> 39:45.258
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

39:45.292 --> 39:47.260
No one's
really paying attention

39:47.294 --> 39:48.428
to where these things are.

39:48.462 --> 39:50.296
I mean, there's got to be
thousands of them

39:50.331 --> 39:51.164
all over the world

39:51.198 --> 39:53.165
and on boats
coming right for us.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.534
And put on inside
an ice cream truck,

39:55.569 --> 39:57.336
drive it into San Francisco.

39:57.370 --> 39:59.070
I'm not even that scared

39:59.105 --> 40:00.472
of burning up in cannibalism.

40:00.506 --> 40:02.707
To me the things that--
Thing that worries me

40:02.742 --> 40:04.109
is-- Is getting trampled

40:04.143 --> 40:06.645
or-- Or shoved up
against a chain link fence

40:06.679 --> 40:08.480
because if you really
think about it,

40:08.514 --> 40:10.182
if you were against
a chain link fence

40:10.216 --> 40:11.850
and you've got a--
A lot--

40:11.884 --> 40:14.619
I mean a lot of people
trying to escape,

40:14.653 --> 40:17.188
pushing hard enough forward.

40:17.222 --> 40:19.923
It's not a joke.
You're going to get squeezed

40:19.958 --> 40:21.125
right through the chain links

40:21.159 --> 40:24.395
like Pla-doh or some
kind of soft meat.

40:24.429 --> 40:27.030
Uh, and this is inevitable,
okay?

40:27.064 --> 40:30.600
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

40:30.635 --> 40:32.802
And if the fence posts
are stuck deep--

40:32.836 --> 40:36.406
Really deep with the cement
way down inside the ground,

40:36.440 --> 40:37.674
then it's definitely
happening to you.

40:37.708 --> 40:41.244
- Blood on the wall.
- Yeah.

40:41.278 --> 40:42.579
Bitch.

40:42.613 --> 40:45.983
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

40:48.153 --> 40:50.287
Like soft meat, man,

40:50.322 --> 40:51.355
right through--

40:51.389 --> 40:55.259
Being squeezed through there
like soft meat.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.729
Like soft meat,
right through the chain.

40:58.764 --> 41:01.432
Right through the--
Right through the chain.

41:01.467 --> 41:04.870
It's-- It's inevitable.
Just--

41:04.904 --> 41:06.038
Hey.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.706
Hey.

41:08.942 --> 41:10.677
Money!

41:43.474 --> 41:44.741
Whoo!

41:44.776 --> 41:45.809
Whoa.

41:45.843 --> 41:46.877
Ohh.

41:48.379 --> 41:51.615
- Ohh, nice.
- Yeah.

41:57.821 --> 41:59.555
To...

41:59.589 --> 42:03.792
Clean cars and clean money.

42:04.994 --> 42:06.027
Hear, hear.

42:12.535 --> 42:13.769
You see?

42:13.803 --> 42:15.871
I told you we'd get it.

42:15.906 --> 42:17.640
Did you?
Mm-hmm.

42:17.675 --> 42:19.042
Wow.

42:21.679 --> 42:26.351
Seriously, that was
really great work.

42:26.385 --> 42:27.920
It's impressive.

42:29.823 --> 42:31.056
Thank you.

42:32.259 --> 42:34.126
And Saul finally came through.

42:34.161 --> 42:35.194
Ahem.

42:35.229 --> 42:37.964
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

42:39.166 --> 42:40.935
Well, yes, he found the guy,

42:40.969 --> 42:43.670
but I told him what to do
and what to say.

42:43.705 --> 42:46.707
You're right.
That's the hard part.

42:48.076 --> 42:52.446
But yes, Saul was, uh...
Finally useful.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.815
Throw him a bone.

42:56.518 --> 42:57.818
Mmm.

42:57.853 --> 42:59.387
Oh, my God.

42:59.421 --> 43:01.856
This is truly amazing.

43:01.891 --> 43:05.227
Yes, well, it better be
at $320 a bottle.

43:05.261 --> 43:06.629
What?

43:06.663 --> 43:09.999
Cuvée Pol Roget,
Sir Winston Churchill.

43:10.033 --> 43:12.635
Apparently, it was
his favorite champagne,

43:12.669 --> 43:14.903
so they just named it
after him.

43:14.937 --> 43:16.704
How did you pay for it?

43:16.739 --> 43:18.439
What do you mean?

43:18.474 --> 43:21.909
Ah. No. Cash.
I paid cash.

43:21.944 --> 43:25.346
No, I'm-- I'm asking
how did you, Walter White,

43:25.380 --> 43:27.682
an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

43:27.716 --> 43:29.083
How do you explain it?

43:29.118 --> 43:32.486
Skyler, no one saw me.

43:32.520 --> 43:35.289
Whoever sold it to you did,
and that's not the point.

43:35.324 --> 43:38.292
The point is we're broke,
remember?

43:38.327 --> 43:40.528
I mean, I'm waiting for your
unemployment check to come

43:40.563 --> 43:42.698
so I can pay the phone bill.

43:42.732 --> 43:44.633
I asked for an extension
from the power company.

43:44.667 --> 43:47.903
Why? Because on paper,
we have no money.

43:47.938 --> 43:50.073
You are completely
overreacting.

43:50.107 --> 43:51.875
I'm not apologizing

43:51.909 --> 43:54.377
for wanting to celebrate
in some small way.

43:54.411 --> 43:56.579
I'm not asking you
to apologize, Walt.

43:56.614 --> 43:58.815
I'm asking you to be smart.

43:58.849 --> 44:02.117
I bought one bottle
of champagne,

44:02.152 --> 44:05.053
one single bottle, Skyler.

44:05.087 --> 44:07.489
I paid cash. That's it.

44:07.523 --> 44:09.424
That's all it takes, okay?

44:09.458 --> 44:10.491
I mean, look at Watergate.

44:10.526 --> 44:11.959
One-- One little piece
of duct tape

44:11.994 --> 44:13.494
- left in a door--
- Oh, my God.

44:13.529 --> 44:15.630
Brought down the president
of the United States.

44:15.665 --> 44:17.566
What, I'm Nixon now?

44:17.600 --> 44:18.634
No, what I'm saying is

44:18.668 --> 44:20.736
the devil is in
the details, okay?

44:20.770 --> 44:24.140
One little mistake,
one slip-up in our story,

44:24.174 --> 44:26.509
that could ruin us.

44:31.483 --> 44:32.783
Fine.

44:44.328 --> 44:46.128
Got to destroy the evidence.

44:50.866 --> 44:52.800
<i>When I look at this--
This image</i>

44:52.835 --> 44:54.469
<i>that is part of the record,</i>

44:54.503 --> 44:58.006
<i>I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction</i>

44:58.040 --> 44:59.341
<i>that can be,</i>

44:59.375 --> 45:00.709
<i>whether it's from any
sort of signage</i>

45:00.743 --> 45:02.244
<i>but especially a signage</i>

45:02.278 --> 45:04.512
<i>that's changing
every five seconds.</i>

45:04.547 --> 45:06.681
<i>Thank you.</i>

45:06.715 --> 45:09.283
<i>Any other questions?</i>

45:09.317 --> 45:12.053
<i>We have a motion
and a second on the floor</i>

45:12.087 --> 45:13.421
<i>to grant the appeal.</i>

45:13.455 --> 45:14.589
<i>All those in favor,</i>

45:14.623 --> 45:16.057
<i>raise your hand and say yes.</i>

45:16.092 --> 45:18.393
<i>Yes is for the affirmative.</i>

45:18.428 --> 45:20.062
<i>Those opposed?</i>

45:20.096 --> 45:24.467
<i>There's five no's,
and that motion fails.</i>

45:24.501 --> 45:26.102
<i>I would like to make a motion</i>

45:26.137 --> 45:27.704
<i>to uphold the decision.</i>
