even see him.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.224
Woman:
Hejust walked right into it.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.560
Somebody was hit by a car.
He needs an ambulance.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.147
I don't know.
He just ran into traffic.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.403
(horns honking)

04:43.325 --> 04:44.906
Woman:
He just ran out.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.067

04:47.245 --> 04:50.703
( helicopter blades

04:51.875 --> 04:55.163
(theme music playing )

05:09.142 --> 05:11.758
Babe, you ready?

You got five minutes.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.854

Jesus, Mom.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.939
- Don't slam the door.
- Man: Come on.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.104
Should have got your ass
out of bed 30 minutes ago.

05:24.282 --> 05:28.150
- ( metal clanging )
- Man: Come on, you son of a bitch.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.829
How's that
working out, babe?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.736
Ye of little faith.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.655
Ye of no faith.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.540
You know the plumber's
card's on the fridge.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.917
- Yeah, I know.
- That guy the Poirers use.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.955
Yeah.
She ready yet?

05:41.132 --> 05:42.747
Alicia, come on!

05:42.926 --> 05:45.258
( groans )
You know she won't eat that.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.510
lt's gluten-fricking-free.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.890
I think ljust
saved us 300 bucks.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.425
Leak fixed.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.514
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, yeah.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.850
(faint radio playing )

05:58.024 --> 05:59.480
-Mmm.
- Really?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.232
- Good morning.
- You fixed it?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.939

06:03.113 --> 06:05.820
-Mmm.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.539
(ringing continues)

06:22.465 --> 06:24.171
Hello.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.670
He has a bruised rib,
contusions.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.258
Physically, your son is lucky,
but I'm more worried about--

06:31.433 --> 06:33.890
- Woman: Toxicology?
- There's that, yes, but--

06:34.060 --> 06:35.721
Heroin's his drug of choice.
What did he take?

06:35.896 --> 06:36.931
He's over 18, ma'am.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.141
I can't tell you any more
than I could tell the police.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.682
They're here?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.350
You should have
led with that.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.519
Nick presented
as delusional, Mrs. Clark.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.779
Witnesses said he ran
into traffic with intent.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.450
- He was high.
- He was ranting.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.200
We had to restrain him.
I requested a psych consult.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.619
- She's not listening.
- She heard you.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.537
Police officer:
Nick.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.372
Buddy.
You with me?

07:05.550 --> 07:08.542
Nick.
( whistles )

07:08.720 --> 07:11.052
- ( snaps fingers)
- I went for a walk.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.883
You were running, Nick.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.764
I went for a run.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.768
Barefoot,
down "Needle Alley"?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.269
Man, Kenyans run barefoot.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.805
Uh-huh.
You said someone got hurt.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.564
You remember that?
You were raving about

07:23.735 --> 07:26.568
"flesh and blood and viscera."

07:26.738 --> 07:29.650
Um, it's runner's high.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.821
Yeah.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.828
Oh, I don't know
what "viscera" is.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.455
Tell us where you scored.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.116
Lots of kids
buying in that hood.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.580
We clean it up,
you come out a hero.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.462
( laughs)

07:46.633 --> 07:49.670
Nick, you
could have died.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.711
Yeah, coulda,
woulda, shoulda.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.552
Police officer:
Okay, we'll take it from the top.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.763
- Nick, why were you running?
- Is my son under arrest?

07:59.938 --> 08:03.476
- No, ma'am.
- Then get out. Thank you. Leave.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.561
- We could charge him.
- Well, charge him when he's healed.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.568
- For now, go away.
- She do all the talking?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.399
Get the-- get out.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.313
I'm not as eloquent.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.777
What happened?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.943
LA. is not
a pedestrian-friendly city.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.113
- Nick.
- ljust tried to beat the light.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.827
Why the restraints?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.452
I don't know.
Ask the lab coat.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.790
Did you try
to hurt yourself?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.421
Nick:
No, Mom.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.127
Come on,
it was an accident.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.172
It was just an accident.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.086
All right, I'm gonna
call for a bed.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.557
- Hey, I'm not going back.
- It's how we help you.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.514
- No, we can't help me.
- Listen to your mother, Nick.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.973
You definitely
can't help me.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.809
- Hey.
- You can't do shit.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.644
- Madison: Nick.
- Nick: Really.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.774
- You can't--
- He's just--

08:48.945 --> 08:50.481
None of you can--
can you just leave me alone?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.486
- Can you just let me go?
- There's an idea.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.648
- Alicia, not helpful.
- I'm not trying to help, Travis.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.283
- What did you say?
- lt's none of his business anyway.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.160
- You know what? Go to the car. Go.
- Travis: It's okay.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.163
- Please just leave me alone.
- Everyone take a breath, huh?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.541
- Take a moment.
-( phone ringing)

09:11.176 --> 09:14.293
- ( ringing continues)
- Tell me what happened.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.881
lt'sjust you and me.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.219
Glad you moved in?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.007
Yeah.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.427
- Liza.
- Did you find him?

09:23.605 --> 09:26.267
Travis: Yeah, wanted
to let you guys know.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.104
- He okay?
- Banged up, but he'll recover.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.984
Liza:
Hard part comes now.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.440
Yeah.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.230
Liza: You gonna be okay
for the weekend?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.488
What do you mean?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.365
Can you still take
Christopher?

09:38.536 --> 09:40.948
- I don't want to go.
- Chris, it's Dad's weekend.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.828
- He has a say.
- Well, | get a say in this

09:42.999 --> 09:43.988
and I don't want to go.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.829
- Let me talk to him.
- Well, maybe I don't want you here,

09:47.003 --> 09:49.210
Mr. Unpleasant.
Maybe I have plans.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.665
Chris: I'll stay at Dante's.
Look, I'm not gonna go

09:50.840 --> 09:52.376
to some hospital
for the weekend.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.006
- Liza: Christopher!
- Let me talk to him.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.838
Please.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.546
Talk to your father.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.970
I don't want to come.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.351
Well, it's my weekend.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.271
Fine, Dad.
Force me.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.603
Let's bond. What do you
got planned for the weekend?

10:11.778 --> 10:14.235
Come on, I'm doing
the best I can.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.112
Yeah, but that really
doesn't help.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.820
We're all building
a family, okay?

10:19.994 --> 10:22.451
All of us.
Now, coming here to support Nick's

10:22.622 --> 10:24.158
- not the worst thing.
- It's up there.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.869
He's not my friend
and he's not my brother.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.544
He'd be there for you.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.121
He wouldn't have
to be there for me.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.161
Not like that. No.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.581
Mom.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.460
Well?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.970
Um-mmm.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.722
Keep him.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.598
( phone beeps)

10:52.402 --> 10:54.108
( intercom beeps )

10:54.279 --> 10:56.144
Woman on P.A.:
Paging Dr. Kloke.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.607
Paging
Dr. Kloke, please.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.318
Madison:
Glad you're okay.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.779
Hey.
Was that Liza?

11:02.954 --> 11:05.491
Yeah.
She sends her love.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.577
Or something
resembling love.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.458
Oh, I've got
college counseling today.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.086
- Kids have applications due.
- Go.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.838
I've got to find
a facility.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.249
Somewhere he's not
already blacklisted.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.338
I can do that.
Stacy can sub.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.013
I can't leave
him like this.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.218
Leave him with me.
I'll stay.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.636
I'm sorry, babe.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.473
Why?
I love you.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.387
- Well, you're stupid.
-Mmm.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.306
- Because you didn't sign up for this.
- I did.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.690
- You didn't sign up for all this.
- Yes, I did.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.022
| signed on for exactly this
when I fell in love with you.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.654
- Don't go sentimental.
- And everything that goes with you.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.482
You just throw up
in your mouth a little?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.322
Yeah, a little bit.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.263
(faint music playing
over headset )

12:07.977 --> 12:11.094
He's gonna be okay.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.263
- Would you take those off?
- I can hear you.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.977
Would you
take them off, please?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.938
"He's going
to be okay."

12:18.112 --> 12:20.273
Yes, he will be.
Thank you.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.815
Well, while
he's restrained.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.954
What?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.702
Could you carry some hope
into the discussion?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.329
He's an adult.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.240
You can'tjust ship
him off to rehab.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.409
You can't send him away
like when he was young.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.999
All you can do now
is what Nick said.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.710
I'm not cutting off
your brother.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.840
He's worse.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.923
Just needs to get
the junk out of his system.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.714
Okay.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.645
Uh-huh...

13:01.823 --> 13:03.905
yeah, I don't think any of this
is gonna happen before lunch.

13:04.075 --> 13:07.067
Talk to me around 2:30.
Good morning, Maddy.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.701
- Artie. Thanks.
- Make sure it doesn't go in my box,

13:08.871 --> 13:09.860
- okay?
- Teacher: You got it.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.870
Lot of kids
out sick today.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.451
Thought you were
another victim.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.162
No, I got
my flu shot.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.746
Oh. You all right?

13:18.381 --> 13:20.167
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.626
We found Nick.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.043
Oh, thank the good Lord.
You must be relieved.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.712
So relieved, yeah.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.267
- He all right?
- He's at Temple Hospital.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.596
Travis stayed, so Stacy's
gonna take his classes.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.307
Ah, well, Stacy can't teach
her way out of a paper bag.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.937
- Yeah.
- You sure you want to be here?

13:37.108 --> 13:39.315
Yeah, it's just for today.
I'm good.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.441
- ( alarm beeping )
- Guard: Hold up right there. Hold up.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.398
- Hold on there, son.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.938
Glad to hear it.
Empty your pockets.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.072
Stop running, Tobias.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.609
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
Empty your pockets, son.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.075
Listen up, Tobias.
Do what Mr. Costa says.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.490
Check your pockets.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.169
(coinsjingle)

13:57.337 --> 14:00.500
77 cents.
Keep it.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.914
Haven't seen you in a while.
How's things at home?

14:03.092 --> 14:06.129
I got it.
Let's go have a chat.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.135
- See you, Artie.
- All right.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.638
Come on,
hand it over.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.024
You know what I'm talking about.
Right pocket.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.016
Thank you.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.479
(sighs)

14:27.200 --> 14:29.065
Sit down.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.328
What's going on?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.915
Nothing.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.875
What's the blade for?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.960
Whittling.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.965
Okay.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.751
ls somebody
bothering you?

14:48.930 --> 14:52.343
Is it Dominic Fratto?

14:52.517 --> 14:55.475
He's been okay.
I tutor him now.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.557
Algebra I.
Remedial moron.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.767
( sighs )
Okay.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.682
So why the knife?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.273
Hey, I could expel you

15:06.447 --> 15:08.062
just for crossing
the threshold with that thing.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.529
No, plea--
it's safer in numbers.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.365
Safer from what?

15:17.708 --> 15:20.791
Tobias, please,
don't screw yourself like this.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.577
You've been working
your ass off.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.336
You're on track
to go to college.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.670
( scoffs )
Yeah, no one's going to college.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.709
No one's doing anything
they think they are.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.799
What? What are you
talking about?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.679
Can I get
my knife back, please?

15:37.854 --> 15:40.561
No, you can't get
your knife back.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.944
They say
it's not connected.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.275
They say that,
but I don't believe them.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.738
It is. From reports
in five states.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.527
They don't know if it's
a virus or a microbe.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.242
They don't know,
but it's spreading.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.452
- You need to--
- No, people are killing.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.163
You need to spend
less time online, okay?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.704
|f-- if there's a problem,
we're gonna know about it.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.625
The authorities
would tell us.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.303
( scoffs )

16:15.475 --> 16:17.386
Yeah.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.391
Sure.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.224
You're right, Miss C.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.606
Can I go now, please?

16:27.570 --> 16:29.606
Yeah, you can go.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.114
( coins clatter)

16:40.208 --> 16:42.290
Spread it out!

16:42.460 --> 16:43.495
Bill! Bill!
Defense!

16:43.669 --> 16:46.001
(spray can hissing )

16:57.767 --> 16:59.849
Paint-by-numbers
bullshit.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.931
Senior project.
It's supposed to be fun.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.097
What'll be fun is coming back
and tagging it later.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.853
Aren't you supposed
to be in Spanish?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.192
Am I?

17:14.367 --> 17:18.280
- What period is it?
- Little asshole.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.240
You know, you could
probably teach that class.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.951
Mmm.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.039
Want to take off?

17:27.213 --> 17:30.046
Unlike you, I'm not smart enough
to be teaching classes.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.509
Have fun.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.344
( chuckles )

17:52.405 --> 17:55.112
( gasps )

17:57.493 --> 18:00.075
You're having
a nightmare.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.203
(sighs)

18:03.374 --> 18:05.831
No shit.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.712
You think that's what
you saw was a nightmare?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.335
Hallucinations?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.547
Mmm.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.634
I really want to write
it off like that, I do,

18:20.808 --> 18:24.300
but that's never
happened to me before.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.560
Nothing like that.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.143
(sighs)

18:30.568 --> 18:32.980
Hey, maybe
I'm losing my shit.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.021
That psych eval
will decide that.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.860
"How crazy is Nick?"

18:39.035 --> 18:41.117
Scale of one
to 10, huh?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.403
Hey, can you
untie me?

18:43.581 --> 18:47.039
- No, sorry.
- Hey.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.163
You think
I'm dangerous?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.499
- Docs are worried.
- Are you?

18:52.673 --> 18:55.585
You ran into traffic, man.
You hurt yourself.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.250
No, l was running from,
not to.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.793
l was running away
from what I saw.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.303
What did you see?

19:02.933 --> 19:06.926
Uh,justa girl.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.388
Um.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.182
Gloria.
Um...

19:13.361 --> 19:14.601
you know,
she's my friend

19:14.779 --> 19:17.521
and she was--

19:18.949 --> 19:21.782
Jesus Christ.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.956
( sighs )
Okay, you buy on the corner

19:29.126 --> 19:31.287
and you can shoot
at the church.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.953
lt'sjunkie communion.
And--

19:34.131 --> 19:37.544
- The church?
- Yeah, Glo was--

19:40.304 --> 19:44.764
yeah, so she was
with me when I scored.

19:46.977 --> 19:51.141
Yeah, and she was with me
when I nodded.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.398
She was there.
She was beside me.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.280
( whispers )
But then--

20:01.450 --> 20:05.238
then when I went down...

20:07.790 --> 20:09.951
everyone was dead.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.622
'Cause there
was blood.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.914
Yeah, and it's
all over her mouth.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.511
You know?
Then she came at me.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.688
What did she do?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.349
Sh--

20:38.362 --> 20:40.444
( whispers )
she was eating them.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.362
She was
eating them.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.789
Nick...

20:51.959 --> 20:53.415
you saw
what the drugs saw.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.793
I don't know if what I saw
came from the powder.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.045
That's the thing.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.501
I don't--

21:02.052 --> 21:04.043
and if it didn't
come from the powder,

21:04.221 --> 21:07.554
then it came
out of me.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.717
My mind.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.227
And if that
came out of me,

21:13.397 --> 21:17.310
then I'm insane,
Travis.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.897
Yeah, I'm insane.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.322
( chuckles )

21:25.326 --> 21:28.318
I really don't want
to be insane.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.410
( brakes squeal )

21:45.095 --> 21:46.926
(flashlight clicks)

21:49.266 --> 21:51.598
( rattles )

22:37.773 --> 22:40.810
( raspy breathing )

23:40.002 --> 23:42.084
Ah, don't!
Don't kill me!

23:42.254 --> 23:44.631
Don't kill me!
(whimpering)

23:44.798 --> 23:46.663
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!

23:46.842 --> 23:49.003
Wait! Wait.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.214
What happened here?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.060
( raspy breathing continues )

24:06.654 --> 24:09.145
(sobs)

24:31.345 --> 24:33.427
( yells )
Hey!

24:34.848 --> 24:37.009
Anyone here?!

25:02.459 --> 25:04.120
- ( bangs)
- ( grunts)

25:04.294 --> 25:06.956
( groans )

25:07.131 --> 25:08.416
Oh, God.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.127
Holy--

25:11.301 --> 25:12.711
What the hell
is going on?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.136
No.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.825
You got an hour
before the first bell.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.336
Mm...

25:52.176 --> 25:55.134
Okay. I need coffee
before anything.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.545
Travis:
Here's your change of clothes.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.051
I'll be
right back.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.605
( intercom beeps )

26:05.773 --> 26:07.604
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Biddle to pathology.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.642
Dr. Biddle to pathology.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.278
That was sweet,
you and the step.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.189
Not our step.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.990
Mom likes him.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.574
Who knows?
She's used to disappointment.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.463
( laughs)

26:33.634 --> 26:36.467
(faint humming)

26:39.389 --> 26:41.880
- I know what you think.
- What's that?

26:42.059 --> 26:46.052
- I know.
- What do I think?

26:46.230 --> 26:48.721
You're perfect
and I'm not.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.649
You know, you're
going to Berkeley,

26:52.820 --> 26:55.152
I got expelled from...

26:55.322 --> 26:56.687
Citrus Community.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.730
( laughs)

26:58.909 --> 27:00.865
I'm here,
you're there.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.903
I don't compare myself.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.366
You can't not.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.123
Well, I don't compare
myself with crazy.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.410
I'm not crazy.

27:11.588 --> 27:12.668
Well, you repeat
the same behavior

27:12.840 --> 27:14.250
and expect different results.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.880
That's Merriam-Webster
crazy.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.626
Hey, it's not gonna
be like this anymore.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.716
- It will.
- No.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.926
- It'll be worse.
- Mm-mmm.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.592
l'm ending it now.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.386
l'm choosing to.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.771
Okay.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.477
Okay?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.987
Okay.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.780
Hey,babe?

27:40.951 --> 27:43.863
These shoes
don't go.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.777
- I went.
- I know, I appreciate it.

27:45.956 --> 27:49.790
No, the shooting gallery.
I found it last night.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.370
What are you
talking about?

27:51.545 --> 27:54.127
Something really bad
happened there.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.254
I don't care.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.632
All right,
Nick needs to know

27:58.802 --> 28:01.635
that whatever he saw
was real or not.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.306
Of course
it wasn't.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.974
He was raving
when they found him.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.131
We're late again.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.800
Thank you.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.185
Travis, you cannot
enable him.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.437
Well, I don't think
he's lying, though.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.439
Oh, so you think
someone ate someone?

28:14.610 --> 28:16.441
- There's a lot of blood.
- It's a drug den.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.318
- It was bad.
- Bad things happen there.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.945
Shootings and stabbings.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.607
( car alarm chirps )

28:23.785 --> 28:25.286
Why are you doing this?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.157
I want to help him.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.830
I know.
I know, babe.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.741
- Right?
- Yeah.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.707
But you can't use Nick
to repair things with Chris.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.007
We'll help both of them.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.588
I promise.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.839
Okay?

28:52.356 --> 28:53.687
I got to go.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.768
Okay.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.655
( car starts )

29:00.822 --> 29:02.107
Oh, God.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.035
You need anything?

29:12.209 --> 29:14.871
Hey, what more
could I possibly need?

29:16.838 --> 29:19.966
Nurse says the shrink
will see you today.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.925
Can't wait.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.805
I'm sorry, Nick.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.225
Hey, it's nothing new.

29:34.982 --> 29:38.770
Get my head shrunk,
get out, get clean.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.738
You mean that?

29:45.909 --> 29:49.743
| always mean it.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.996
Alicia: I can't believe
I did that for a week.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.202
Oh, I'm so done.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.538
(Alicia sighs)
One more year.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.420
- One more year and I'm gone.
- Matt: What about me?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.842
Alicia: Well, Berkeley's got
a good arts program.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.171
Name me one artist
I like from Berkeley.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.427
Exactly.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.180
We're only
a few hours away.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.058
Same state,
same time zone.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.561
Won't have to miss
me that much.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.940
But I will.
I will miss you that much.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.105
| just need
to not be here.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.947
Saw your brother again?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.616
He doing better?

30:41.465 --> 30:44.707
Better than he was
48 hours ago? Sure.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.213
Better than he'll be two
days after he's released?

30:52.726 --> 30:54.967
It's not on you,
Alicia.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.561
(sighs)

31:02.736 --> 31:04.317
One more year.
One more year.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.819
One more year.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.980
Hey, meet me
after school.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.240
- I can make this better.
- ( chuckles )

31:10.410 --> 31:12.446
Yeah, how?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.612
You magic?

31:14.790 --> 31:16.576
Whoo.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.291
Your folks
still out of town?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.669
Mm-hmm.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.171
Meet me at the beach.
We can watch the sunset.

31:25.342 --> 31:26.832
Go back to my place.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.251
Get free
from your family,

31:29.429 --> 31:30.589
lgetyou
all to myself.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.348
We get each other.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.318
You like it?

31:49.699 --> 31:50.984
Mm.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.037
Travis:
Question of the day.

32:07.676 --> 32:11.385
Now, what is London
trying to teach us here?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.637
That wasn't
a rhetorical question.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.975
You keep working on that.
That's good.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.057
Way to go, Brandon.
To think, good.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.017
- To listen.
- To listen. Yeah, that's good.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.727
All right, anybody else?

32:24.901 --> 32:26.562
What do you think?

32:26.736 --> 32:28.863
Love the cartoons,
but this is an English class.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.237
Put it away.
Russell!

32:33.076 --> 32:35.567
Enlighten us.
Come on, bud.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.282
I don't care about
building a fire.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.415
Travis: No?
Can you build a fire?

32:41.585 --> 32:43.746
Russell: I got a stove.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.751
- ( class laughs)
- Russell: I got heat. I'm good.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.173
All right,
all right.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.672
So what about
this wolf dog?

32:49.843 --> 32:51.379
Does he care about
the man in the story?

32:51.553 --> 32:53.259
Hell, no.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.920
HeH,no?
Why?

32:55.098 --> 32:57.259
'Cause the man tried
to cut the damn dog open

32:57.434 --> 32:59.265
to keep his hands warm.
That's gruesome.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.018
That's gruesome,
but why would he do that?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.679
To build a fire.

33:03.857 --> 33:06.644
But why?
Why would he build a fire?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.854
(snaps fingers)
Think about it. Think about it.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.441
- Why would he build a fire?
- To not die.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.903
Nailed it.
See, man versus nature.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.410
London's trying to teach
us how not to die.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.117
Good analysis, Russell.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.953
Imagine what would happen
if you stayed awake in my class.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.504
( class laughs )

33:26.671 --> 33:28.536
So...

33:28.715 --> 33:32.253
Uh, so the man

33:32.427 --> 33:35.134
may offer warmth,
he may offer food...

33:52.989 --> 33:54.399
Artie?

34:00.747 --> 34:01.987
Artie.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.161
You know how I have
to evaluate

34:06.336 --> 34:07.496
each teacher
each semester?

34:07.671 --> 34:10.788
- Mm-hmm.
- l'm evaluating.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.831
Woman: Next,
divide both sides by two...

34:13.009 --> 34:15.796
Travis:
...the dog abandons him.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.804
Mm-hmm.
The dog is instinct.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.010
The dog is nature.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.470
And nature, well,

34:23.645 --> 34:26.603
nature always wins.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.435
( raspy breathing )

34:43.665 --> 34:45.872
Sir, are you okay?

34:47.168 --> 34:48.499
Making a break for it?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.786
- Is he okay?
- Sure.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.585
I'm here for him
and for you.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.419
Oh, no, I don't have to.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.679
I take my dog out when I want to,
not the other way around.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.137
- Oh, I'm the dog?
- You're the dog. Scooch.

35:06.980 --> 35:11.565
Um, do you think you could
untie one hand, please?

35:14.195 --> 35:16.686
Come on,
it'll be easier.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.901
Less messy.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.737
Just a little privacy.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.902
(sighs)

35:33.214 --> 35:35.170
I'll give you a moment.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.049
Thank you.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.891
( clangs )

35:54.069 --> 35:56.276
( monitor beeping rapidly)

35:56.446 --> 35:58.983
Oh, no. Code blue! Code blue!
Room three! Room three!

35:59.157 --> 36:01.443
Code blue!

36:01.618 --> 36:04.860
(monitor flatlining)

36:05.038 --> 36:07.324
- Doctor: When'd he go down?
- Nurse: Just now. 30 seconds, maybe.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.535
Doctor: If we don't get a rhythm
in 60, I want him downstairs.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.290
- Doctor.
- Too much we don't know.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.793
- Doctor.
- Charge to 200.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.124
- Clear.
- Nothing.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.336
Doctor:
Charge to 250.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.968
Nothing.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.881
Okay, this gentleman needs
to be downstairs now.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.971
Man:
Let's bring him just in case.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.472
Stay put.
I'll be back for you.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.884
(siren wailing in distance)

38:15.043 --> 38:16.283
-( phone rings)
- Madison: How does he just leave?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.497
- He's over 18.
- They didn't release him.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.207
Shrink hadn't filed
his evaluation.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.996
- Maddy.
- He almost died, Travis.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.712
Wait, wait.
Excuse me.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.002
- Where's my son?
- I don't know.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.091
- I'm sorry. What happened?
- His roommate coded.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.221
There was a second death on the floor.
It was chaotic.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.519
- You need to find him.
- You need to call the police.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.187
I'm sorry, he's gone.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.891
All right, nurse?

38:40.777 --> 38:43.564
Take me.
Take me where it started.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.237
Travis: Well, there's nothing left
to see there.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.072
He might go back.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.283
Wants to understand
what he saw.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.743
Well, I went there.
I saw.

38:56.918 --> 39:00.126
Maddy, trust me,
you don't want to do this.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.584
l have to see it.
Even if he's not there.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.794
l have to see it.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.648
Madison: This is where
he disappears.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.060
Stay here.
I'll go in.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.149
You think I'm waiting
in the truck?

39:29.325 --> 39:31.611
Travis:
Hello?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.747
There's no bodies.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.132
They couldn'tjust
get up and walk away.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.014
( gasps )

39:57.645 --> 40:01.012
- Maddy.
- Something bad happened here.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.523
You said it yourself.
Things happen here all the time.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.860
Yeah.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.693
It's a violent place.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.373
This isn't
your fault, Maddy.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.375
It's in the genes.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.037
Nick's got problems,
Alicia doesn't.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.337
Well, I'm batting .500.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.637
He's not here.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.893
- Let's go, Maddy.
- No.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.898
This is where
he slept.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.902
Maddy.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.503
- What is it?
- It's Nick's.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.223
( groans, sighs)

41:25.066 --> 41:27.227
Hey.

41:27.402 --> 41:30.109
It's okay.
Madison.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.067
Come away now, angel.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.403
Come away.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.284
(crying)
Oh, God.

41:50.299 --> 41:53.132
( dogs barking )

41:53.302 --> 41:55.088
(sirens wailing in distance)

41:55.263 --> 41:56.878
Home?

41:57.056 --> 41:59.092
No, not yet.

42:01.269 --> 42:04.102
( helicopter blades whirring )

42:14.073 --> 42:16.450
Let's try Calvin's.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.403
(vacuum humming)

42:25.460 --> 42:27.746
Cal.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.535
Hey.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.670
(vacuum turns off)

42:31.841 --> 42:34.048
Miss C.
Mr. Manawa.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.504
Cal. Good to see
you, man.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.590
- Hey.
- Hey, Cal.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.972
- You look good.
- Thank you.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.513
You're looking for Nick.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.769
Yeah, he was in
an accident.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.645
The cops picked him up.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.101
Have you seen him?

42:50.276 --> 42:52.187
He ran away
from the hospital.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.192
No, I haven't
seen him in a while.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.775
You got any ideas
where he'd go?

42:56.949 --> 42:59.986
He wouldn't--
no.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.697
He wouldn't hang
where he used to.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.452
He moved away from us.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.956
Yeah. Yeah.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.376
I could make some calls.
Maybe someone's heard.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.959
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

43:14.133 --> 43:15.714
Anything for Nicky.

43:15.885 --> 43:17.466
- Thanks, Calvin.
- Mm-hmm.

43:25.478 --> 43:28.185
(line rings)

43:28.356 --> 43:31.223
Chris's voice: Hey, it's Chris.
Leave a message.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.870
Hey, man.
Listen, I'm sorry to call you,

43:46.040 --> 43:49.999
but I really, really--
like, I need to talk to you.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.875
Can you just--
can you hit me back?

43:52.046 --> 43:55.163
It's important.
Okay, bye.

43:55.341 --> 43:58.754
(music playing )

44:01.722 --> 44:04.589
- Boy: Yes, made it!
- Girl: Like, crazy, right?

44:04.767 --> 44:08.430
( chatter continues )

44:40.887 --> 44:42.593
We're gonna find him.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.630
He doesn't want
to be found.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.966
We'll bring him home.

44:49.145 --> 44:52.228
Travis, he'd rather sleep in that place
than his own bed.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.810
I don't--

44:56.485 --> 44:58.271
I don't know if I want
him to come home.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.980
| get it.

45:02.158 --> 45:03.989
You do?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.572
I don't.

45:06.746 --> 45:09.112
- What does that make me?
- ( sirens wailing)

45:10.666 --> 45:11.655
Human.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.620
Weak.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.584
I'm just tired of waiting
on the call from the morgue.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.170
Not gonna happen.

45:23.638 --> 45:26.971
We're gonna find him,
we're gonna get him in rehab.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.132
I'm gonna drag him there
if! have to.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.175
I will cuff
our wrists together

45:31.354 --> 45:33.766
and drag his ass.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.022
I promise.

45:37.193 --> 45:39.354
- ( sirens wailing)
-( helicopter blades whirring )

45:47.286 --> 45:49.242
Better call Alicia.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.995
Get her to eat something.

45:55.378 --> 45:58.745
Might have been
a high-speed gone bad.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.920
Officer on megaphone:
For your own safety,

46:04.095 --> 46:06.336
please remain
in your vehicles.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.379
- ( siren chirps)
- Whoa!

46:13.187 --> 46:15.394
( police radio chattering )

46:16.816 --> 46:18.181
Can you see anything?

46:18.359 --> 46:19.644
No.

46:19.819 --> 46:22.936
( people shouting )

46:23.114 --> 46:26.948
Officer on megaphone: Please remain
in your vehicle at all times.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.575
-( people screaming )
- ( gunshots)

46:29.745 --> 46:31.201
Get back in the truck.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.454
- What the hell is happening?
- Back in the truck.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.541
I'm getting
out of here.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.258
( helicopter blades
whirring )

46:59.358 --> 47:01.098
Only five?

47:01.277 --> 47:03.563
What, did you miss
a few stops?

47:05.364 --> 47:07.480
I hope you guys
got your flu shots.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.442
Teacher: KTLA killed the feed
before it went ugly,

47:11.620 --> 47:13.872
but the cameras
kept rolling.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.621
Someone leaked
the footage.

47:16.751 --> 47:17.866
What the hell
is this?

47:18.044 --> 47:20.000
Teachen
Artie, check this out.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.832
Costa:
What?

47:29.430 --> 47:30.795
Guy's not dead.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.307
Traumatized from the accident
or he is on something.

47:35.478 --> 47:37.685
Man on video:
Sir! Sir?

47:37.855 --> 47:39.061
Costa:
What the hell?

47:39.231 --> 47:41.017
- Man on video: Sir, get on the ground!
- Wait a minute.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.274
Teacher:
Look how they beat the guy.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.060
Man on video:
On your knees or I will shoot

47:46.238 --> 47:48.229
No, no!

47:48.407 --> 47:49.738
Bring up additional here.
Cal it in, call it in.

47:49.909 --> 47:52.070
We need additional backup.

47:52.244 --> 47:53.700
There's an explanation.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.077
No one's offered it.

47:55.247 --> 47:58.159
Folks talking
airborne toxins,

47:58.334 --> 47:59.995
poisoned water,
viruses.

48:00.169 --> 48:01.534
Costa: This is why
everyone's staying home.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.293
Teacher:
Look at this.

48:03.464 --> 48:05.705
How they unload on him.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.417
How he keeps coming.

48:09.595 --> 48:10.835
Costa:
I've got to call the district.

48:11.013 --> 48:12.719
See how they want
to play this.

48:16.185 --> 48:18.426
This is what Nick
was describing.

48:20.523 --> 48:23.356
- Call the police.
- You're sure?

48:23.526 --> 48:25.983
We have to find him.
I don't know how else to do it.

48:26.153 --> 48:28.405
( exhales )

48:37.581 --> 48:39.537
Nick: Hey, man.
Listen, I'm sorry to keep calling you,

48:39.708 --> 48:41.164
but I got to know what
went down at the church.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.667
Please just call me back.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.259
Teacher: Traditional science deals
with predictable phenomena

48:59.437 --> 49:01.223
such as gravity...

49:01.397 --> 49:03.012
Girl, your parents
were there?

49:03.190 --> 49:05.181
- My mom and Travis, yeah.
- ...electricity,

49:05.359 --> 49:07.520
chemical reactions.

49:07.695 --> 49:11.279
We're talking about
nonlinear things

49:11.449 --> 49:13.861
that are impossible
to predict or control--

49:14.034 --> 49:16.867
weather, brain states...

49:17.037 --> 49:20.495
- ( gunshots)
-( people on video screaming )

49:20.666 --> 49:23.248
Ladies, am | confiscating
phonestoday?

49:26.964 --> 49:29.296
It's not real.
It can't be real.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.879
Watch, this here's
the new real.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.384
Kill shot, bitch.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.224
Matt's not texting me.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.134
And you're not
texting him.

49:42.313 --> 49:44.019
Give it up, Alicia.

49:44.190 --> 49:46.226
Costa on P.A.:
Good morning again, students.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.483
The district has decided
today will be a half day.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.609
Repeat, today
will be a half day.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.566
When the bell rings,
proceed to your buses...

49:53.741 --> 49:55.652
- Do you mind?
- ...in a calm, orderly fashion.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.112
(bell rings)

49:58.287 --> 50:00.403
- I want you on the bus.
- What's going on?

50:00.581 --> 50:02.742
People are worried
about the shooting.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.703
Wasn't that fake?

50:04.877 --> 50:06.993
I want you home, okay?

50:07.171 --> 50:08.377
What about Nick?

50:08.547 --> 50:10.412
Well, you'll be there
if he comes back.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.800
When he comes back.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.801
When.

50:16.972 --> 50:20.055
Yeah, go, baby.

50:20.226 --> 50:21.841
Costa on P.A.: Teachers and faculty,
please report to the office...

50:22.019 --> 50:24.431
- Thank you.
- ...with your dismissal lists.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.650
Hey.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.981
Let's get out of here
before we get blocked in.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.106
I'll get the truck.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.571
( students chatting )

51:34.133 --> 51:36.340
(coughing)

51:45.227 --> 51:47.183
Nicky, what's going on?

51:47.354 --> 51:50.061
Hey, Cal,
I'm really sorry.

51:50.232 --> 51:51.517
What are you
talking about?

51:51.692 --> 51:54.900
I'm sorry to put you
in this position and--

51:55.070 --> 51:56.776
Sit.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.824
Your mom's
looking for you.

52:11.545 --> 52:14.082
What do you mean?

52:14.256 --> 52:16.542
Showed up
at my folks'.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.457
Oh.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.467
Can't have that.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.048
- Can't have people...
- No.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.473
...coming to me
looking for you.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.427
Hey, she doesn't know
what you do, Cal.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.216
You're not
talking about me?

52:27.394 --> 52:29.885
No.
No, Cal. Cal.

52:30.064 --> 52:32.726
Hey, man, |--

52:34.151 --> 52:36.392
she's just really
worried about me.

52:41.533 --> 52:43.865
Cal, I swear.

52:44.036 --> 52:46.573
I swear, man.
I would never hurt--

52:46.747 --> 52:48.578
I would never--

52:48.749 --> 52:51.240
I'd never tell anyone
what you--

52:51.418 --> 52:53.409
what you do.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.334
- You hungry?
- No, no, no, no.

52:58.509 --> 53:01.216
- You need to get some food up in you.
- No, no, no.

53:01.387 --> 53:05.346
|just-- I need to know
what you gave me.

53:06.767 --> 53:08.303
I didn't
give you anything.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.510
Was it laced, man?
Was it PCP?

53:11.689 --> 53:13.600
- Laced?
- Was it PCP?

53:13.774 --> 53:15.514
Yeah, I want
my customers paranoid

53:15.693 --> 53:17.308
and pissed off
and immune to pain.

53:17.486 --> 53:19.022
You talking about my shit?

53:19.196 --> 53:21.027
- No.
- Then where's your head at?

53:27.371 --> 53:29.032
(sighs)

53:29.206 --> 53:32.289
Cal, the church,
it was a bloodbath.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.074
It was a horror show.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.118
Gloria killed two people.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.957
And I need to get
it out of my head.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.793
Gloria's 90 pounds
soaking wet.

53:39.967 --> 53:42.083
- Yeah.
- Barely strong enough to spike a vein.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.923
- I know.
- You're not making any sense, Nicky.

53:45.097 --> 53:48.806
I know. I know.
I know, but I saw it, Cal.

53:48.976 --> 53:51.262
I saw her do it and I need
to get it out of my head.

53:51.437 --> 53:53.268
You need
to contain yourself.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.555
- You need to contain yourself.
- Okay, yeah.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.902
I'm so sorry.
I'm leaving.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.734
- Come on, stay.
- No, man, I'm gonna go.

54:04.908 --> 54:07.490
Nicky, stay.

54:07.661 --> 54:08.992

54:18.505 --> 54:21.042
You think you saw
some bad shit.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.127
(crying)

54:23.302 --> 54:24.883
I can't wipe it out.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.510
- I can't. I can't scrub it out.
- Yeah, you can.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.512
Yeah, you can.
Yeah, you can.

54:36.648 --> 54:38.604
How long has it been?

54:38.776 --> 54:41.813
Um, a couple
ofdays.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.943
Couple days.

54:46.992 --> 54:48.903
Okay.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.614
l'm managing.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.952
- Clearly. Clearly.
- I'm really trying.

54:57.669 --> 54:59.796
You got your works?

54:59.963 --> 55:01.954
No.

55:05.219 --> 55:07.050
I got you.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.212
Oh, man.
Thank you so much.

55:09.389 --> 55:12.131
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go. Come on.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.442
Your mom told me
you were in an accident.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.818
Yeah. Yeah.

55:35.874 --> 55:37.705
Cops talk to you?

55:37.876 --> 55:40.709
They had a lot
of questions.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.752
Mm.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.618
Sit tight, brother.
It's safe here.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.871
(door opens, beeping )

56:19.710 --> 56:21.575
( door shuts)

56:33.640 --> 56:35.847
(trunk shuts)

56:36.018 --> 56:38.134
-( knocks)
- Come on.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.603
Nicky, come on.

56:43.859 --> 56:46.145
Come on.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.981
Come on, man.

56:50.699 --> 56:52.360
Hurry up, man--

56:52.534 --> 56:54.525
No, Nicky!

58:08.360 --> 58:11.397
Nick: No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.607
Nick, hey,
I said not to bring her.

58:13.782 --> 58:15.192
I told you not
to bring her.

58:15.367 --> 58:18.655
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.444
- Travis, I said not to bring her.
- Are you all right?

58:20.622 --> 58:21.907
I know.
We've both been looking for you.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.698
- Why wouldn't I? Are you okay?
- I did a-- I did--

58:24.876 --> 58:26.491

- It's okay.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.659
What are you talking about?

58:27.838 --> 58:28.827
It's okay,
just get in the truck, Nick.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.496
- It's not okay.
- Nicky, what happened?

58:30.674 --> 58:33.461

58:34.970 --> 58:36.005

what was in--

58:37.806 --> 58:39.342
what was in the shit
he gave me, you know?

58:39.516 --> 58:40.722
What are you
talking about, Nick?

58:40.892 --> 58:42.393
Calvin.
I shot Calvin.

58:42.561 --> 58:44.722
- Calvin?
- I shot Calvin. I killed Calvin.

58:44.896 --> 58:47.558
Where's Calvin?
Where?

Nick! Where?
What are you talking about?

58:50.736 --> 58:52.351
Just"

58:54.489 --> 58:56.195
Madison:
It's my fault.

58:56.366 --> 58:58.322
Calvin must have gone
looking for him.

58:58.493 --> 59:01.030
We don't know what
we're dealing with here, Maddy.

59:01.204 --> 59:02.364
We don't know.

59:04.166 --> 59:05.906
I do.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.042
Whatever happened,

59:09.212 --> 59:11.043
it was
self-defense, okay?

59:13.759 --> 59:15.545
Self-defense.

59:32.027 --> 59:33.767
Madison:
That's his car.

1:03:33.268 --> 1:03:34.849
What the hell

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:37.011
l have no idea.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:56.492
