WEBVTT

00:01.417 --> 00:03.625
Instead of burning
another small town hood in some

00:03.625 --> 00:04.792
snowed in, Rust Belt shit hole,

00:05.000 --> 00:08.542
what do you say to a little trip
out to sunny Los Angeles?

00:10.625 --> 00:14.250
Hey, man! You must be Barry!
I'm NoHo Hank.

00:14.542 --> 00:15.959
This is Ryan Madison.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.709
- You guys want him gone?
- Yes!

00:17.709 --> 00:20.083
He went to this
theater to take an acting class.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.417
You know how you and I talk
all the time about my purpose?

00:23.166 --> 00:25.083
You think acting could be
your purpose?

00:26.291 --> 00:28.417
-My class is not cheap.
-Well, that's not a problem.

00:29.792 --> 00:32.041
Stop thinking. Kill Ryan.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.417
These Chechens are talking about
taking you off this job.

00:35.417 --> 00:36.250
No, no, no, no, no!

00:36.667 --> 00:38.000
Don't pull a gun at me.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.333
How does this
make us better actors?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.166
It loosens you up,
prepares you

01:14.166 --> 01:16.667
for the unexpected in a scene,
gets you out of your head.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.291
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

01:28.667 --> 01:31.166
Glad you got accepted
to the class.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.542
Me too.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.208
Gene doesn't let
just anyone in.

01:34.208 --> 01:36.333
You must've really impressed him
with your mono.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.333
Thanks.

01:38.542 --> 01:39.542
Folks.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.667
Ryan Madison...

01:43.667 --> 01:44.709
is dead.

01:44.709 --> 01:46.792
Oh!

01:46.792 --> 01:48.625
I...

01:48.625 --> 01:50.166
I...
What?

01:54.834 --> 01:56.792
- All right, everyone.
- Everyone.

01:58.291 --> 01:59.625
Focus.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.625
Focus.

02:02.625 --> 02:05.375
Now, I wish I could say
that this was the first time

02:05.375 --> 02:09.083
that one of my students
was gunned down in the street,
but it's not.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.875
And as much as it pains me
to say it...

02:11.875 --> 02:14.667
it is most likely not the last.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.917
So, where do we go from here?

02:16.917 --> 02:22.083
I say... we do what Ryan
would've wanted us to do,
and we use it.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.333
I'm sorry. Mr. Cousineau,
what-- what's that mean?
"Use it"?

02:27.333 --> 02:33.166
Use Ryan's death,
the way that you are feeling
right this second--

02:33.166 --> 02:35.333
the sorrow,
the rage, the...

02:36.250 --> 02:37.834
the terror.

02:37.834 --> 02:41.625
You know, I use my past
all the time in my work.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.709
If I want pure sorrow,

02:43.709 --> 02:47.250
I call up
Princess Diana's death.

02:47.250 --> 02:52.458
Or the day that my dad
fell off the roof
when I was a kid.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.792
Kerplunk.

02:53.792 --> 02:57.792
Or the next day
when he went right
back up on that roof.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.583
Hi, Dad.

03:01.041 --> 03:04.000
I-I just-- I just thought
since everyone was so...

03:04.000 --> 03:07.083
bummed out,
maybe we could cheer
ourselves up by...

03:07.083 --> 03:10.500
playing characters
and putting on some wigs.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.417
Wigs?

03:12.417 --> 03:14.750
Well...
This is not
playtime, Barry.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.375
No, I, um--
This is not Cheers.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.750
I am not Sam Malone.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.250
You want to blow off steam?
You do it after class.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.917
No, no, I-I--
I know that. No.

03:21.917 --> 03:25.458
I'm-- I'm actually quitting
my job so I can, um,
focus on this more.

03:25.458 --> 03:29.041
That is great.
Total commitment.

03:29.041 --> 03:33.125
I'm next!
Like I know-- I know I'm next!

03:33.125 --> 03:35.667
You probably are next.

03:35.667 --> 03:40.250
Look, we're all still very raw,
so I say class dismissed.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.542
Go home, and I encourage
you to journal

03:43.542 --> 03:45.792
all of your emotion,
all of your feelings.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.875
But... even though
we're not acting,

03:49.875 --> 03:52.166
we're still learning to act.

03:53.542 --> 03:54.959
This class counts.

03:54.959 --> 03:57.667
Stepping away from the class

03:57.667 --> 04:01.333
is in itself a lesson.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.166
So there are no rain checks
is my point.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.333
Okay, everyone pays
full boat for today.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.250
Okay, so we got
two DBs in the BMW,
still waiting on IDs,

04:23.250 --> 04:24.834
but they look Russian
or Chechen.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.625
Someone from
Gang Unit joining us on this?
Cemenko's on his way.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.959
Okay. Now,
there was this third guy
in the passenger seat,

04:30.959 --> 04:32.500
but he was luckier
than his buddies,

04:32.500 --> 04:34.083
'cause it looks
like he got away.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.125
And in the Ford,
there's this poor
Ryan Madison--

04:38.208 --> 04:41.959
Wait. Is Detective Loach--
is he crying?

04:41.959 --> 04:45.166
Look, look, look, look.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.625
He is definitely crying.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.000
Wait. He's crying
in all of these.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.667
You didn't hear?
Uh-uh.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.834
He and Diana broke up.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.834
They did?
Yeah.

04:55.834 --> 04:58.000
Inside a year?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.041
Shit.
I just won 300 bucks.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.709
That's cold.
Oh please!

05:01.709 --> 05:04.625
He's a homicide detective,
and she's a human being.
That shit don't last.

05:04.625 --> 05:08.667
Plus, if the department
had wanted him to have a wife,
they'd have issued him one.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.500
Any neighbors
with security cameras?
No, but...

05:12.917 --> 05:14.750
there was
a tiny camera
in the car.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.709
"The car."
What's that mean?
Which car?

05:16.709 --> 05:19.250
The BMW.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.542
So, you find a camera
in the vics' BMW,

05:22.542 --> 05:24.208
and you're just now
telling me about it?

05:24.208 --> 05:26.875
I mean,
it took 20 minutes to even
figure out it was a camera.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.041
I mean, like,
I thought it was
a crazy marijuana pipe.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.166
I thought
it was a laser.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.375
Yeah, Rob thought
it was a laser.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.709
Everyone listen.

05:47.709 --> 05:50.166
I think we need
to do something for Ryan.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.625
We should have
a memorial tonight.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.250
Great idea.
We can have it
at my apartment--

05:53.250 --> 05:55.417
We'll have it at Jake's.
My friend Juan's
bartending tonight.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.417
We'll get a deal.
That's great.
I love that, actually.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.667
Speak, sing,

05:59.667 --> 06:01.625
perform a scene
that Ryan did in class,

06:01.625 --> 06:03.291
whatever you think
Ryan would've liked.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.959
I'll put a sign up
on the class Facebook page,

06:04.959 --> 06:06.875
so check it for details.
Thank you.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.500
I'm not on Facebook.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.333
I'm not even there.
That's the whole point.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.417
You know what? I'm gonna
do something else.
It's unifying.

06:12.417 --> 06:14.542
I'm gonna do it.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.375
These subtitles
fucking suck.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.750
Why are they
in a forest?

06:31.750 --> 06:34.583
I wanna know what
that kid's gonna do.

06:36.166 --> 06:40.125
I've never seen someone
be happy and angry
at the same time.

06:45.792 --> 06:49.041
Brought to you by
wolf attacking a horse.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.667
Hey. Do you have my video?

06:50.667 --> 06:52.083
Yeah, it's on the camera.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.375
Yeah, I-- I know it's
on the camera.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.417
You're supposed
to get it off the camera.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.166
We need to order
an adapter.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.667
No, go buy an adapter.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.834
There's like
50 Russian electronic
stores in Glendale.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.250
Also, Loach
and his wife split up,

07:04.250 --> 07:06.291
so you owe me
50 bucks each, remember?

07:06.291 --> 07:09.834
Moss, guys,
how we doing?

07:09.834 --> 07:12.125
No, Loach.
How you doing?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.333
What?

07:26.834 --> 07:29.709
Fuches, it's me.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.166
Hey. Oh.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.542
Oh. Hold on.
Hold on. Shh.

07:36.542 --> 07:38.667
Fuches, what are
you still doing here?
You gotta go.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.542
No, no, no, I'm not going--
I'm not going anywhere, bud.
I told you to go.

07:41.542 --> 07:44.291
This is war.
Those Chechens
double-crossed us.

07:44.291 --> 07:47.041
I mean, they hired you
to do a job, and then
they try to kill you?

07:47.041 --> 07:49.583
No. No. No.
I-- I told 'em
you have a process.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.917
Listen, Fuches,
I talked to Pazar...

07:53.041 --> 07:55.125
and he told me
that if you leave town,

07:55.125 --> 07:57.375
he'll sweep
this whole thing
under the rug.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.750
Really?

07:59.750 --> 08:03.000
No. No, he didn't say that.
I don't know why
I just said that.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.041
You said it because
you're trying to protect me,

08:05.041 --> 08:06.667
and I appreciate that, buddy.
But you know what?

08:06.667 --> 08:09.375
I've been going through
some combat scenarios
on this video game here

08:09.375 --> 08:13.000
and I don't know--
I think, based on my research,
God, we can take 'em!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.875
You know, I-I-- I'll be here
in the command center,

08:15.875 --> 08:18.667
and you'll be--
you'll be out there
in the field,

08:18.667 --> 08:21.625
you know,
killing all of Pazar's guys,
and together, man--

08:21.625 --> 08:24.000
together we will
fuck them back.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.417
Listen, Fuches,
it's not about the guys
in that house, all right?

08:28.417 --> 08:30.417
There's a whole organization
out there, okay?

08:30.417 --> 08:33.625
And plus, there's probably
still more back in Chechnya.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.083
Ah.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.417
You're right.
You're right.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.750
We can't--
we can't outgun
these dudes. We...

08:43.875 --> 08:47.250
We leave.
Yes. Well, actually, no.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.625
You'll leave...
and I'll stay

08:50.625 --> 08:52.083
and face the music.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.917
You want me to get out
of here for my own safety

08:53.917 --> 08:56.333
and leave you here
with the Chechens?
No. Uh-uh. No.

08:56.333 --> 09:01.750
I-I-- I googled Chechnya,
and, bro... they're crazy.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.750
Fuches...

09:04.333 --> 09:06.458
It's my mess.
Let me deal with it.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.458
Okay, but then
you get on a plane,

09:09.458 --> 09:12.208
you come back to Cleveland,
and we'll go back to work.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.917
Just like before.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.834
Yes.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.458
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

09:22.458 --> 09:24.875
- Uh, hey, Moss.
- Where's my video?

09:24.875 --> 09:26.458
You need a code
to unlock it.

09:26.458 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, everything was
going smoothly until we got
to this screen.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.500
So, you just stopped
when you saw this?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.333
Well, we were researching
possible ways to unlock it

09:34.333 --> 09:36.291
and ended up going down
a little K-hole--

09:36.291 --> 09:39.166
Okay, how many
possible codes
could there be?

09:39.166 --> 09:40.875
Four digits, so a lot.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.834
We're trying
to get in contact
with the manufacturer to--

09:42.834 --> 09:45.000
Get out of the way.
Come on. Move, move, move.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.834
That could take months.
All right, first, first,

09:47.834 --> 09:49.834
you try 0-0-0-1.

09:49.834 --> 09:51.834
All right, so we know
it's not 0-0-0-1.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.125
Next, you do, uh...

09:54.125 --> 09:55.750
Right? Not 0-0-0-2.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.333
Okay, you go on to...

10:00.500 --> 10:02.458
What the hell?
I think
you just locked it.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.375
Did you know
that was gonna happen
and you let me do that?

10:04.375 --> 10:06.333
We didn't want you
to yell at us.
All right.

10:06.333 --> 10:10.792
Now-- now I'm gonna
have to call the FBI.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.458
- You guys are assholes.
- FBI.

10:12.458 --> 10:13.667
Hi!

10:15.875 --> 10:17.834
You know why everything
went to hell, right?

10:17.834 --> 10:20.625
That fucking hug.
You got to close to your mark

10:20.625 --> 10:22.000
and it put you off your game.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.208
It's like when I was
a cook, in the Army.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.333
- I never named my chickens.
- I just...

10:27.333 --> 10:31.458
See, you never
experienced any fallout
from your job, Barry.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.542
I've been protecting you
from that.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.917
Now, you're gonna be
all right without me?

10:35.917 --> 10:37.375
I'm gonna be great.
We need to go.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.667
You know, I-- I swore
an oath to your dad

10:39.667 --> 10:41.583
that I wouldn't let
the world walk all over you.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.208
It's repayment for him
saving my ass in 'Nam.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.875
During 'Nam.
During 'Nam.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.583
Fine, whatever,
but, you know,
a barracks in Connecticut

10:48.583 --> 10:51.041
in the late '60s,
that was a rough place.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.375
Uh, I gotta take this.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.875
I think I might've
won something.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.041
All right.

11:02.709 --> 11:03.834
Hello?

11:03.834 --> 11:05.834
Hey, Barry.
Hey, it's Sally.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.208
Hey, how you doing?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.625
Hey, the Ryan thing's
not canceled, is it?

11:10.625 --> 11:12.750
No, it's still on.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.208
Oh. Oh, great.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.917
I mean, not great,
but, you know, thank God.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.542
Yeah, so
I wanted to ask you...

11:18.542 --> 11:21.667
I was so concerned
with making sure
everyone else had a spot

11:21.667 --> 11:23.500
that I didn't give
myself anything.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.917
Oh no.
Yeah, so you can
totally say no,

11:25.917 --> 11:27.750
but would you wanna do
a scene with me tonight?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.583
You wanna do
a scene with me?

11:29.583 --> 11:32.125
Yeah, well, everyone
else has something, so.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.792
Oh yeah, absolutely.
What's the scene?

11:34.792 --> 11:36.333
It's the last scene
I did with Ryan.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.667
It'll be weird
not doing it with him,

11:37.667 --> 11:40.041
but I felt like my performance
was self-contained.

11:40.041 --> 11:42.625
Yes! Have you seen Doubt?

11:42.625 --> 11:44.333
It's this movie where
Meryl Streep is a nun,

11:44.333 --> 11:46.083
and she makes Philip
Seymour Hoffman,
who's a priest,

11:46.083 --> 11:48.125
admit he's been
molesting little boys.
It's amazing.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.917
- It sounds amazing.
- You'd be the priest.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.250
No, it totally
makes sense.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.291
I'd love to play
a priest that's
molesting little boys.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.625
Um, do we, like, practice
or something or--

11:56.625 --> 11:59.709
Yes. Meet me at 6:30,
at Jake's, a half-hour
before the show.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.250
I'll bring your pages
and your wardrobe,

12:01.250 --> 12:03.375
and we can run it
a few times so you don't
have to be off book.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.333
Great.
Great.
Okay, thanks, Barry.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.792
Awesome.
Okay, bye.

12:08.125 --> 12:11.834
Siri, what is "off book"?

12:11.834 --> 12:13.667
Freeze, cowboy.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.542
Showing two results
for "off book freeze cowboy."

12:16.542 --> 12:18.625
You couldn't
fucking hear me?

12:18.625 --> 12:22.375
Huh? I was screaming at you!
What the fuck?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.917
I was on the phone and...
Ah!

12:23.917 --> 12:27.291
You know, buddy,
I have to be honest.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.417
I'm quite a bit angry...

12:30.417 --> 12:32.667
...but I'm going to put
that aside for now,

12:32.667 --> 12:35.750
because rage is
counterproductive, yes?

12:35.750 --> 12:39.583
And I know, if the situation
were reversed,

12:39.583 --> 12:41.458
I probably would've done
same thing you did.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.291
You did do what I did.
You tried to kill me.

12:44.291 --> 12:47.500
Okay, well, now we're getting
a little "he said, she said."

12:47.500 --> 12:50.166
Uh, okay, so, buddy...

12:54.000 --> 12:57.542
So, after you were finished
shooting me, right,

12:57.542 --> 13:00.500
and, uh,
I had lost consciousness...

13:00.500 --> 13:03.000
did you perhaps take
something out of the car?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.917
No.
No? Like specifically
off the dashboard maybe?

13:06.917 --> 13:08.667
No.
Small blinking item?

13:08.667 --> 13:10.792
You didn't bring
that fucking lipstick camera
with you, did you?

13:10.792 --> 13:15.166
- What? No.
- That would be super crazy, huh?

13:15.166 --> 13:17.417
This conversation
never happened, okay?

13:17.417 --> 13:18.417
Hey, Goran.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.542
Barry and Fuches...

13:21.542 --> 13:23.041
on the silver plate.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.000
You did not think
I would find you?

13:30.083 --> 13:32.458
You killed two of my men.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.583
One of them...

13:34.583 --> 13:36.166
Lucky...

13:36.166 --> 13:38.542
...was best Chechen assassin.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.625
Well, he wasn't that great.
Hey, let's not--

13:40.625 --> 13:43.250
You put me in big
fucking bind, buddy!

13:44.583 --> 13:47.542
Lucky, he had job
to do tonight.

13:47.542 --> 13:51.417
He was to take out guy
who give us some...

13:51.417 --> 13:54.208
confidential information.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.542
About a Bolivian
stash house.
Shut the fuck up.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.834
Oh.
Now, I make calls
to my family,

14:01.834 --> 14:05.333
and they are sending someone
to take Lucky's place,

14:05.333 --> 14:08.750
but who knows
how long that will take.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.458
This hit is...

14:13.750 --> 14:15.750
This hit is urgent.

14:15.750 --> 14:16.834
No way.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.917
- Why not?
- Why would I work for you?

14:18.917 --> 14:20.417
Man, you--
you double-crossed me.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.625
I don't like it
when people do that.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.667
Aw... that's water
under bridge.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.000
Have one
of these guys do it.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
They are not assassins.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.834
They are muscle.
Big difference.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.291
Well, have Hank do it.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.709
You fucked him up!
Yeah. Yeah.
This arm is bullshit.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.125
Right, well...
What about that guy?

14:40.208 --> 14:42.333
Vacha?

14:42.333 --> 14:44.917
He is fucking freak.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.750
You see this... apron?

14:49.959 --> 14:51.458
Why is he wearing that?

14:52.542 --> 14:54.959
He doesn't need
to be wearing that.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.625
No, he's too...

14:57.625 --> 14:59.291
self-consciously scary.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.875
He's just a lot, you know?

15:00.875 --> 15:03.083
It's like...
"We get it."

15:03.083 --> 15:04.500
No, no, no, I...

15:06.291 --> 15:07.875
I want you
to do it, buddy.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.834
He-- he wants you
to do it, Barry.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.709
Yeah, I don't--
I don't wanna
do this anymore.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.625
You-you-- you don't wanna--
you don't-- what?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.667
Yeah, I-I-I--
I don't do this anymore.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.500
I don't wanna do it.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.834
Lucky, man you kill,

15:30.834 --> 15:32.875
was Vacha's brother.
Ooh. Whoa.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.583
- Vacha was...
- Hey.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.417
...crying all day.
Hey.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.792
It was very fucking annoying.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.709
Ah.
No.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.959
Ah.
Ah... ahh!

15:43.959 --> 15:46.500
Oh. Hey, hey, hey.
Tell him to stop.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.208
Hey! Goran!

15:48.208 --> 15:50.125
He stops
when you agree to job.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.375
He's gonna file
my fucking teeth!

15:52.375 --> 15:55.625
Say yes!

15:55.625 --> 15:57.542
I can't.
I'm sorry. I can't.

15:57.542 --> 16:01.208
You can't? You ca--

16:01.208 --> 16:03.834
Oh! Hey! Hey!
Tell him to stop!

16:03.834 --> 16:06.083
Goran, tell him to stop!

16:08.291 --> 16:09.333
Tell him to stop!

16:09.333 --> 16:10.583
When you hit bubbles,

16:10.583 --> 16:12.166
and then more bubbles
come down.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.709
Well, I'm working.

16:22.709 --> 16:23.875
Okay. Okay.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.667
My daughter
is having sleepover,

16:32.667 --> 16:34.208
and we are
being too loud.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.041
Vacha!

16:38.875 --> 16:40.458
Hey, hey.
All right.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.250
Yes, or we kill him now.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.291
Barry.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.583
Ple-- please. Please.

16:50.417 --> 16:51.750
All right, fine.
I'll do it.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.959
That's-- this is it.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.125
No more jobs.
This is it.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.500
This is the only one.
You understand me?

16:56.500 --> 17:00.542
Hey, we hold onto Fuches
until it's done...

17:00.542 --> 17:02.667
so get to it.
Let me just
tell you something,

17:02.667 --> 17:05.458
if you--
if you hurt him...
any more,

17:05.458 --> 17:07.709
if you--
if you kill him, anything...

17:10.125 --> 17:11.583
I'll come back here...

17:13.125 --> 17:14.917
and I'll kill
every single one of you.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.375
You understand me?

17:19.583 --> 17:21.417
He cares about Fuches.

17:21.417 --> 17:22.792
That's just nice.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.583
Barry.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.333
You're gonna get
right on this, right?

17:33.458 --> 17:34.709
Yes.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.583
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

17:37.792 --> 17:38.792
You can.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.125
How?
Confess.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.792
Why are you trying to attempt--
you are trying to--

17:42.792 --> 17:44.333
attempting to destroy
my reputation. Ah.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.625
You know what?
This, uh--
What's wrong?

17:46.625 --> 17:48.125
This is really serious.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.625
It is serious.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.417
See, I think
I misunderstood you
on the phone.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.583
I thought this was, like,
supposed to be funny.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.375
A-- a man
molesting children?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.125
Yeah, like how
Family Guy  is funny.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.834
I just don't know
what it's like to be a--
like, a child molester,

17:59.834 --> 18:02.375
Oh. No.
so I don't know
if I could play one, you know?

18:02.375 --> 18:03.959
No, you don't have
to know what that's like.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.291
No, you just have
to know what it's like
to hurt somebody.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.458
So just, you know,
think of a time

18:07.458 --> 18:09.375
when you hurt someone,
and use that.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.458
Whoops!
Okay, not the john.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.792
I'm sorry. Wait.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.083
What are you doing?
Are you doing Doubt?

18:17.083 --> 18:18.542
Oh, let's not do Doubt.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.834
But it's the last scene
Ryan and I did together.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.208
The class loved it,
remember?

18:22.208 --> 18:24.458
I just don't think
we should evoke
child molestation

18:24.458 --> 18:26.000
at a memorial.
Please, Gene.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.667
Ryan would've wanted this.
Hey, you know what?

18:27.667 --> 18:29.583
It's totally up to you.
I gotta pee.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.333
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.125
Oh, don't worry about him.
This scene'll be awesome.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.000
This scene always works.
From the top.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.333
"You have to stop
this campaign against me."

18:41.333 --> 18:44.000
Webster's Dictionary
defines "death"

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
as "a permanent cessation
of all vital functions."

18:48.000 --> 18:51.375
It defines "remember"
as "to bring to mind

18:51.375 --> 18:52.667
or think of again."

18:52.667 --> 18:57.834
So, even though Ryan's
vital functions have ceased,

18:57.834 --> 19:01.750
if we think of him,
he will always be with us.

19:04.291 --> 19:07.542
Um, I'm going to perform

19:07.542 --> 19:09.583
an audition
that Ryan helped me with.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.583
Here is
"Cop Number Two."

19:15.792 --> 19:18.125
Get on the fucking ground!

19:18.125 --> 19:21.208
Eat dirt, bitch!

19:27.875 --> 19:29.417
Giving up smoking is easy.

19:29.417 --> 19:33.041
I should know.
I've done it thousands
of times.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.500
Oh.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.291
Hey, hey. Okay,
I think we're next.
Hey.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.375
Okay. All right.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.250
Where are you at right now?

20:41.250 --> 20:43.125
Uh, I'm at a bar with you.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.667
No. No, I meant...

20:45.667 --> 20:48.458
Right?
Yes, it'll be fine.

20:53.291 --> 20:54.500
Whoo!

20:54.500 --> 20:59.208
Wow. Antonio,
that was... something.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.500
Now, before we bring up
our last act,

21:02.500 --> 21:04.333
I'd like to introduce you
to a guest speaker.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.792
He came all the way
from Wisconsin.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.333
He wants to meet you...

21:09.333 --> 21:11.875
to express his gratitude...

21:11.875 --> 21:13.166
and to grieve.

21:13.166 --> 21:17.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ryan's father, George Krempf.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.458
Uh...

21:24.458 --> 21:26.834
when my son, Ryan,

21:26.834 --> 21:29.500
told me he wanted
to be an actor...

21:31.500 --> 21:33.917
I thought he was crazy.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.583
But after seeing
this lovely show
y'all put on here,

21:37.583 --> 21:39.750
I am so grateful
that he was surrounded

21:39.750 --> 21:42.041
by such a loving community.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.208
Who would do this
to my boy?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.542
Oh God.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.417
Hey!
Hey, Barry, what the--

22:08.417 --> 22:10.083
Do you not want
to do the scene?
Just-- I've never--

22:10.083 --> 22:12.959
I've never been around
for something like that,
you know? I've never--

22:12.959 --> 22:15.542
Yeah, I know, I know.
That was-- it was intense.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.250
No, it's just
that I've never
seen that, you know?

22:18.250 --> 22:21.333
Like, the-the--
the guy lost his son,
you know?

22:21.333 --> 22:23.417
Hey. Hey, Barry, it's okay.
It just--
it's just messed up.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.959
No, it's not okay.
No, this is a good thing.

22:25.959 --> 22:28.291
These-- these feelings
that you're having right now,

22:28.291 --> 22:30.542
these are the paints
in your acting toolbox.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.125
You know, that's what
this class is about--

22:32.125 --> 22:34.458
you know, getting to that,
taking that apart,

22:34.458 --> 22:36.083
and-- and dealing with it.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.542
It's called "being human."

22:39.792 --> 22:41.250
That's what acting is.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.333
I don't know
if I can do that.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.583
We'll help you.

22:49.083 --> 22:50.375
Look, come on back in.

22:51.792 --> 22:52.875
Come on.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.542
Come on.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.917
Look, I'm fine not doing
the scene, you know?

23:00.917 --> 23:03.208
It's-- it's really
all Father Flynn anyway.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.166
Meryl Streep is
just the straight man.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.125
Hey.

23:10.959 --> 23:14.208
Hey!
Barry, you're back!

23:28.458 --> 23:31.458
- To Ryan.
- Ryan. Whoo!

23:31.458 --> 23:33.291
Whoo!

23:33.291 --> 23:36.917
He was so good.
Okay, so the best thing
about the scene that you did...

23:38.291 --> 23:40.125
I mean, I'm glad
we didn't do it,

23:40.125 --> 23:43.000
'cause I mean who wants
to follow up a father talking
about his murdered son?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.792
I mean,
it's a no-win situation--

23:44.792 --> 23:46.041
not fair to us.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.417
How about you?

23:48.417 --> 23:51.166
Are you okay?
Yeah. No, yeah,
thank you.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.959
For that talk--
that was good.

23:52.959 --> 23:56.291
I'm looking forward to putting
some paint in the toolbox.
Yeah.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.000
I mean, when I first
started in this class,
I was very overwhelmed.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.458
But then I saw
everyone else perform,
and I was like, "Oh."

24:02.542 --> 24:04.542
And then it was easier.
Oh.

24:09.667 --> 24:12.750
So, what's your deal?
What's my deal?

24:12.750 --> 24:15.625
Yeah, you're like a weird nut
I can't crack.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.750
I am?
Yeah. I--

24:17.750 --> 24:20.542
Oh. Um...
This is a mistake.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.500
It is?
It's always a mistake.
We shouldn't do this.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.709
Do what?
Sleep with each other.
I know it seems like we should,

24:24.709 --> 24:27.709
but trust me, I've been
through this a million times,
and it's always a mess,

24:27.709 --> 24:30.500
so I just-- I--
I don't think we should,

24:30.500 --> 24:33.667
even if we want to.
Yeah, I wasn't thinking that.

24:33.667 --> 24:34.667
Oh.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.375
Um, uh... cool.

24:40.166 --> 24:43.959
So do you want
to come in and talk about
why we shouldn't do it?

24:43.959 --> 24:46.542
No, I just wanted
to walk you to your door.

24:47.709 --> 24:50.250
But thanks
for everything tonight.
Thank you.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.709
And I'll see you in class.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.417
Good night.
Good night.
