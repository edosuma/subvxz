Armory could be a trap.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.950
Those weapons
better be worth it.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.920
It's about six hours old.
That's when the rain stopped.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.421
Those ones are empty.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.064
Okay, who's got the ball?

00:32.064 --> 00:34.565
HAL:
Right here.

00:36.369 --> 00:40.237
Think you can get it that far,
old man?

00:40.307 --> 00:43.475
$5 million says you can't hit
the front steps.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.477
[laughs]

00:45.478 --> 00:48.414
You make that a stick of gum,
we got a bet.

00:48.415 --> 00:52.465

Ready for this?

02:11.598 --> 02:14.098
It's time to get up.

02:19.205 --> 02:23.375
If I see him, I'll let you know.
I'm sorry.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.712
What was that?

02:26.713 --> 02:28.781
Word's out I saw harnessed kids
before we hit the ShopSmart.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.322
They want to know
if I saw their kid.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.522
Aw, man.
Oatmeal again?

02:37.590 --> 02:39.625
We passed a Denny's.
Maybe you can get a Grand Slam.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.226
Bite me.

02:41.227 --> 02:44.229
Not much of a morning person,
are you, Matthew?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.098
Come on, you go get in line.
I'll catch up to you.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.066
I have to go report in.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.500
You gonna go look
for Ben tonight?

02:48.501 --> 02:49.768
That's the plan.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.638
I found some sticks
in the basement.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.139
Want to play catch later?

02:54.140 --> 02:56.640
After school?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.513
TOM:
No sign of any Skitters,

03:01.514 --> 03:04.506
but wherever there's
a Mech...

03:04.584 --> 03:06.118
Weapons inside?

03:06.119 --> 03:07.853
Didn't go in.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.588
Didn't feel it was worth taking
it on and attracting Skitters.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.390
You were to be discreet.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.959
Well, we had a little breakdown
in discipline.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.427
We drew fire.

03:15.428 --> 03:16.929
Who?

03:16.930 --> 03:18.297
Jimmy.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.766
He's a good fighter.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.267
TOM:
13 years old.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.440
Go back tonight.
Find out for sure.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.476
No, our agreement was that
we would be going after Ben

03:30.477 --> 03:31.610
once we scouted
the armory.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.011
Which you haven't done.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.580
You're right.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.381
That said, just like
the food stores

03:36.382 --> 03:37.983
and the pharmacies
that we've seen,

03:37.984 --> 03:40.819
it's probably empty, and
the Skitters are just staking it out.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.454
And you're probably right,
but we need to know.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.722
Hey, this isn't
what we talked about.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.457
You find a better place
to make camp?

03:45.458 --> 03:46.725
I scouted City Hall.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.026
Too many windows,
buildings all around.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.728
I saw a factory
on the edge of town

03:49.729 --> 03:51.330
might work, though.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.365
I'm guessing you didn't see
any harnessed kids.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.300
You know
how much I want to.

03:55.301 --> 03:58.370
All right, let's go.
Come show me on the map.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.539
ANNE:
Captain Weaver.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.974
Dr. Glass.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.475
Couldn't help but notice

04:03.476 --> 04:04.743
all your people are
sleeping in houses

04:04.744 --> 04:06.345
while the rest of us
are in tents.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.648
My fighters need the best sleep
they can get,

04:09.649 --> 04:11.450
and we need to be able
to get the civilians

04:11.451 --> 04:12.885
out of here fast
in case of attack...

04:12.886 --> 04:14.753
wouldn't be feasible
if everyone was in houses.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.488
Well, maybe we take
a few houses

04:16.488 --> 04:17.956
and rotate
some people through.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.625
What, are you
their leader now?

04:19.625 --> 04:22.493
There's no leader.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.963
I'm a doctor,
and doctors hear things.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.833
Well, doctor,
you tell your patients

04:27.834 --> 04:30.402
that if they're dissatisfied,
they're free to leave.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.504
If they want the protection
of my soldiers,

04:32.505 --> 04:35.207
they can minimize the whining
and be grateful for the oatmeal.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.409
They're not just eaters.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.678
They know that's what your soldiers
say about them sometimes...

04:39.679 --> 04:40.846
they're eaters.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.282
They contribute
to the fight.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.718
They cook. They fix clothing.
They haul trash.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.280
Dr. Glass,
a few years from now,

04:50.356 --> 04:52.224
when the Skitters
have been wiped out

04:52.225 --> 04:55.861
or sent back to
the undoubtedly hideous planet

04:55.862 --> 04:57.529
that they call home,

04:57.530 --> 05:00.899
the concerns of the civilians
will be addressed.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.390
Until then,
there's no time for this.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.473
Dear lord.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.381
I did not come here
to get in an argument.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.717
[indistinct conversations]

05:18.718 --> 05:20.319
Uncle Scott wants
a word with you.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.720
He has some thoughts
on the aliens

05:21.721 --> 05:23.222
he thought
might be useful.

05:23.223 --> 05:27.663
Happy to talk to him
after I get a little food.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.498
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for an egg...

05:33.499 --> 05:37.458
some bacon...
A hash brown.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.938
White or wheat?

05:39.939 --> 05:41.907
English muffin,
fork-split,

05:41.908 --> 05:44.376
with enough butter
that would make

05:44.377 --> 05:47.412
a doctor such as yourself
worry about my heart.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.481
Ha!

05:49.482 --> 05:52.417
You know, you never gave
your opinion.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.986
On?

05:53.987 --> 05:56.321
The rights
of the civilians.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.423
I don't think I've ever been
to Acton before.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.518
It's a nice town.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.363
Civilians versus the military...
it's an age-old question.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.244
What side
do you come down on?

06:08.835 --> 06:13.415
I think civilians are
a liability and a hindrance.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.907
And I also feel

06:15.908 --> 06:19.444
that they're the best motivation
we have to fight.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.746
CHILD:
No!

06:20.747 --> 06:22.314
This way!

06:22.315 --> 06:24.316
CHILD #2:
Just kick it!

06:24.317 --> 06:25.651
Kick it! Yeah!

06:25.652 --> 06:27.452
Come on!
Come on, guys!

06:27.453 --> 06:28.987
[man laughs]

06:28.988 --> 06:30.322
Here you go.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.823
[indistinct conversations]

06:31.824 --> 06:33.492
SCOTT:
Biology.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.960
CHILDREN:
Biology.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.623
SCOTT:
Biology, biology...

06:37.697 --> 06:40.999
It's from a Greek word
meaning "life discourse."

06:41.000 --> 06:43.869
That's from the dictionary.
But you know what it is to me?

06:43.870 --> 06:48.739
To me, it is the study
of the most miraculous gift

06:48.808 --> 06:52.008
that has ever been bestowed
on us.

06:52.011 --> 06:56.311
It is the study of the wonder
and the beauty

06:56.382 --> 06:59.051
and the mystery
that is life itself,

06:59.052 --> 07:01.552
and to study it is to...

07:01.587 --> 07:03.522
Well, is to learn humility

07:03.523 --> 07:05.824
and responsibility

07:05.825 --> 07:08.350
and gratitude, right?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.662
Yeah, Matt?

07:10.663 --> 07:12.798
We're not grateful
for Skitters.

07:12.799 --> 07:17.002
SCOTT:
No. No, we are not grateful
for Skitters, right?

07:17.003 --> 07:21.707
And we're not grateful for
parasites or cancer, either.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.475
But they are part of life,

07:23.476 --> 07:26.011
and we're grateful for the
chance to study them, right?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.480
And hopefully by studying them,
we'll be able

07:28.481 --> 07:32.617
to better figure out
how to kill them, right?

07:32.618 --> 07:33.652
Right?

07:33.653 --> 07:36.153
BOY: Yep
SCOTT: You bet.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.624
I had a class of, uh... of older kids,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.960
And I had them brainstorming
about the aliens.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.029
And they came up
with mostly, you know,

07:44.030 --> 07:45.897
the stuff that we
all talked about...

07:45.898 --> 07:48.066
that the Skitters
must come from a planet

07:48.067 --> 07:49.901
similar to ours, and...
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.902 --> 07:52.070
...that they have a wide range
of temperature tolerance.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.505
Anyway,
this one girl came up

07:53.506 --> 07:55.073
with something
that made me think.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.576
She said, you know, whenever
we've dreamed up robots,

07:57.577 --> 07:59.511
we've always imagined them
to sort of be

07:59.512 --> 08:00.712
basically like ourselves...

08:00.713 --> 08:03.409
a head,
two arms, two legs.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.418
But the Skitters
have six legs.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.787
And yet, their robots,
the Mechs, are bipedal.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.489
Now, why wouldn't
they build robots

08:10.490 --> 08:11.990
that look like themselves,
you know?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.625
Well, chances are

08:13.626 --> 08:16.128
they've been studying the earth
for a while.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.096
Maybe they built Mechs
that way

08:18.097 --> 08:20.799
to have a bigger
psychological impact on us.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.801
Maybe, huh?

08:22.802 --> 08:24.803
Hey, Hal.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.705
Those harnessed kids
you saw the other day...

08:26.706 --> 08:28.240
they were headed west?

08:28.241 --> 08:29.908
Yeah, but they may have changed
direction after I saw them.

08:29.909 --> 08:34.744
Hey, you, uh, never asked
if I saw your son.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.815
I figured you'd tell me
if you had.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.216
After I saw Ben, you know,
I just...

08:38.217 --> 08:39.818
I didn't see
anything else.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.686
We'll be going out tonight.
I'll be looking for him.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.554
Well, when you go,
I'd like to go with you.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.150
All right.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.292
Hey,
do you need a hand?

08:47.293 --> 08:48.693
I got it, but thanks.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.861
You could take mine.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.296
Uh, oh. Okay.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.831
- She's kidding.
- I am?

08:52.832 --> 08:54.966
You are. Right?

08:54.967 --> 08:56.601
O- Okay.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.236
Um...

08:58.237 --> 09:01.840
Hey, I saw you walk in
past the outpost sentries.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.175
You looked tired.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.243
What were you doing
by the outpost?

09:05.244 --> 09:07.813
I was in the church
on the corner, praying.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.549
It's Episcopalian, not Catholic,
but it's close.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.051
I wonder if the Skitters
have a God.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.954
I- I know a lot of people
have lost their faith,

09:15.955 --> 09:17.989
but mine is stronger
than ever.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.624
Good for you.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.593
The next time you get
on your knees and pray,

09:21.594 --> 09:23.662
could you see
if the big guy might get us

09:23.663 --> 09:25.797
an operational B-2 bomber
loaded with nukes?

09:25.798 --> 09:28.333
I don't pray for God
to give me things.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.869
I don't think
that's how it works.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.270
Then what do
you pray for?

09:32.271 --> 09:36.601
I ask God to show me
what I could do for him.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.820
Wonder who she was...

09:48.821 --> 09:51.321
girl who lived here.

09:51.357 --> 09:54.588
Well, maybe she's
still alive.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.035
She liked
"Harry Potter."

10:04.036 --> 10:06.836
Dad used to read these
to me.

10:06.906 --> 10:10.535
I'd always fall asleep.
[chuckles]

10:10.610 --> 10:12.377
He read them all to Ben.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.279
Lucky Ben.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.049
Maybe Lourdes
could read them to you.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.018
Oh, for...
she's just being nice.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.220
She's just trying to get
in your shorts.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.955
- Karen.
- Oh, don't play dumb.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.057
I'm sure you had
plenty of experience

10:26.058 --> 10:28.293
with the female admirers
back at school.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.761
I played lacrosse.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.230
Football players
got the groupies.

10:32.231 --> 10:37.760
Hey, you know there's
no competition, right?

10:37.837 --> 10:39.204
Hal, change of plans.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.739
Whoa!
[chuckles]

10:40.740 --> 10:42.140
Uh, get a room.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.736
We got a room.
Could you knock?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.112
Just wanted
to let you know

10:47.113 --> 10:49.381
we're going back
to the armory tonight.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.949
We're going to look
for Ben.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.817
Weaver wants us
to make sure

10:52.818 --> 10:54.786
that there's
no weapons there.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.888
There aren't any.
They're using it as bait.

10:56.889 --> 11:00.154
We're gonna go
make sure.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.928
We'll get Ben
tomorrow night.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.362
Well, I'll go with you
when you do.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.232
- ANTHONY: Me too!
- DAl: Count me in!

11:07.233 --> 11:09.997
[chuckles]
Thin walls.

11:10.069 --> 11:13.249
I guess everybody
hears everything.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.646
We'll find him.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.219
Yeah.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.961
All right.

11:35.962 --> 11:40.058
Jimmy, come here
a second.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.400
You're gonna sit this one out,
all right?

11:42.401 --> 11:44.836
Because I screwed up?

11:44.837 --> 11:47.472
Tom needs someone bigger
in case they find weapons.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.140
- That'll be me.
- Okay?

11:49.141 --> 11:51.309
Good.
Get some rest.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.810
- All right.
- We ready?

12:00.786 --> 12:03.536
You're a good soldier,
Jimmy.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.415
[bow fires]

12:30.416 --> 12:32.916
[gasps]

12:33.919 --> 12:35.320
[bow fires]

12:35.321 --> 12:37.821
[machine-gun fire]

12:40.126 --> 12:41.292
Lights out!

12:41.293 --> 12:43.928
What the hell?
Is it Skitters?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.762
[groaning]

12:49.869 --> 12:53.930
Not gonna die.
Not gonna die, hear?

12:54.006 --> 12:57.075
BILLY:
Oh! Oh, Johnny, man,
I've been hit, buddy.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.177
I've been hit, bro.
- POPE: What the hell happened?

12:59.178 --> 13:01.079
What do you think happened?
I've been shot!

13:01.080 --> 13:03.081
- 'Cause you shot first!
- No, I didn't. I didn't.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.417
Shut up! We're supposed
to do this on the quiet.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.785
I was quiet!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.486
Shut up a second!

13:08.487 --> 13:11.222
There's no way the robot
didn't hear that gunfire.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.091
What do you want?

13:13.092 --> 13:17.756
Well... You...
And your guns.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.531
[thudding]

13:19.532 --> 13:21.499
Listen.
You hear that?

13:21.500 --> 13:24.298
Now, you start firing,

13:24.370 --> 13:26.438
robot comes in.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.840
Whereas
you don't do what we say,

13:28.841 --> 13:31.810
we will start picking you off
without so much as a whisper.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.511
So you have a choice.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.175
Put down your guns
and come with us.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.251
TOM:
Why don't you shine a light on yourself,

13:40.252 --> 13:42.053
Let me see
who I'm talking to?

13:42.054 --> 13:46.494
Why don't I shine a light
on these two instead?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.986
Put down
your guns now,

13:53.065 --> 13:55.966
or these two
get skewered.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.269
[whirring]

13:58.270 --> 14:00.405
Whitey, Cueball, get Billy.
Let's go.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.840
Come on.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.004
[thudding, whirring]

14:07.413 --> 14:10.314
- Okay, go, go, go!
[gunfire]

14:19.058 --> 14:21.559
- BILLY: Aah!
- POPE: Just take it easy.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.095
We're taking the access tunnels
to home base.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.297
Aah!
Just watch my leg!

14:26.298 --> 14:28.798
[groaning]

14:40.479 --> 14:42.979
Easy!

14:50.723 --> 14:51.890
BILLY:
Ugh! Get it off!

14:51.891 --> 14:54.325
Come on, man, get it off.
Come on.

14:54.326 --> 14:56.561
Are you gonna dose me up?
Come on, buddy.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.396
CUEBALL: Here it comes, Billy.
- Come on, come on, come on.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.531
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.399
- Here it comes.
- [groans]

15:01.400 --> 15:02.567
You ready?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.803
Yeah, yeah.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.864
You got that?
Attaboy.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.307
POPE:
How's he look, Whitey?

15:09.308 --> 15:10.542
He's bleeding hard
in the leg.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.876
Probably nicked
an artery.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.845
Severed it, he'd have
bled out already.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.314
Use your belt.
Bind it tight.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.449
Any of you happen to be

15:18.450 --> 15:22.690
a board-certified microsurgeon,
fix my brother?

15:25.591 --> 15:28.458
Then what good are you?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.228
So, where you from?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.729
TOM:
Cambridge.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.737
And how are things
in Cambridge these days?

15:39.738 --> 15:41.973
Worse than
they are here.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.474
What are you, family?

15:44.510 --> 15:46.845
Well, obviously not all.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.281
No. Just came together
a couple months ago.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.217
You part
of some resistance?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.585
No.

15:53.586 --> 15:58.455
Just a group of people
trying to survive.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.225
Then where'd you get
the weaponry?

16:00.226 --> 16:03.161
Dead cops,
National Guard.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.729
So, what do we got?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.699
Papa Smurf,

16:07.700 --> 16:09.801
sexy freedom-fighter girl,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.436
strapping young man,

16:11.437 --> 16:14.439
black...
looks like a gangbanger,

16:14.440 --> 16:19.571
and a...
Oriental of some sort.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.979
[chuckles]

16:20.980 --> 16:23.414
We'll take the girl
and the boy. The black?

16:23.415 --> 16:25.283
- Hell no.
- Hell no. Unh-unh.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.818
WHITEY:
What about the Chinaman?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.487
Asians are good
at fixing things.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.822
That's true.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.357
We're not gonna
let you drive.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.392
[laughter]

16:34.393 --> 16:37.093
Which brings us
right back...

16:38.430 --> 16:42.196
to Papa Smurf.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.835
See, now, I'm figuring,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.704
since you're the only one
willing to speak up,

16:46.705 --> 16:48.039
that you're their leader.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.707
We need
another leader, boys?

16:49.708 --> 16:51.976
Nah.
I didn't think so.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.678
[gun cocks]

16:53.679 --> 16:55.413
W- We can get you
more guns.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.881
Where?

16:56.882 --> 16:59.584
I thought you were all
just a bunch of strangers

16:59.585 --> 17:01.619
thrown together by fate.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.454
We're with the resistance. We're part
of the 2nd Massachusetts.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.357
The what?

17:07.425 --> 17:10.792
[laughs]
The 2nd Massachusetts?

17:10.863 --> 17:13.627
Well,
how Revolutionary War.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.599
So, what do you got,

17:15.601 --> 17:17.868
fife and drums,
tri-cornered hats?

17:17.869 --> 17:20.964
No. We have guns.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.447
Hey!

17:32.885 --> 17:36.377
What you have, punk,

17:36.455 --> 17:39.891
is a.50-cal mounted
to the back of a GTO.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.894
You got 111 fighters
and 200 civilians

17:42.895 --> 17:44.595
camped out
in the big meadow.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.360
I've been watching you...

17:47.433 --> 17:51.164
for two days.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.506
That's why we were
staking out the armory.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.908
Figured you'd be looking
for guns.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.648
I'm not gonna kill
your old man.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.149
Ugh!

18:08.854 --> 18:10.655
Now, he is
your old man, right?

18:10.656 --> 18:15.493
I can't imagine you shouting out
like that if he wasn't kin.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.628
[grunting]

18:17.629 --> 18:20.129
You know what?

18:22.468 --> 18:24.968
[groans]

18:31.643 --> 18:34.393
We're not gonna
kill anybody.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.481
Not yet.
[smooches]

18:39.885 --> 18:42.752
You're all
way too valuable.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.951
So, here's
what we're gonna do.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.427
We're gonna make a deal.

18:50.496 --> 18:56.560
You lot for the.50-cal
on the back of that car.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.135
Maggie.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.875
Darling, please escort
young prince charming here

19:03.876 --> 19:05.576
back into town

19:05.577 --> 19:07.578
so that he can bring
the terms of our deal

19:07.579 --> 19:10.114
to the supreme
allied commander

19:10.115 --> 19:13.915
of the 2nd Massachusetts.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.429
So, what were you...

19:32.504 --> 19:36.065
you know... before?

19:38.877 --> 19:41.377
I taught history...
B. U.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.615
History? What kind of...
kind of history?

19:44.616 --> 19:46.084
The Sumerians on up,
what?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.452
American.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.953
American?

19:51.323 --> 19:54.058
So, how's
the resistance going?

19:54.059 --> 19:56.559
Just getting started.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.629
You honestly
believe that?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.998
I do.

20:00.999 --> 20:04.902
POPE:
History buff such as yourself
ought to know better.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.038
I taught
the American Revolution.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.006
You know
how that turned out.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.808
Yeah.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.643
But is that
the right, uh...

20:12.644 --> 20:15.554
what do you call it...
analogy?

20:16.582 --> 20:18.516
Instead of us
being the colonials

20:18.517 --> 20:20.518
and the aliens
being the redcoats,

20:20.519 --> 20:22.520
isn't it more like
we're the Indians

20:22.521 --> 20:24.856
and they're the never-ending
tide of humanity

20:24.857 --> 20:26.124
coming in from Europe?

20:26.125 --> 20:28.659
How'd that work out
for the Indians?

20:28.660 --> 20:32.391
Well, if you don't see
any hope...

20:32.464 --> 20:34.432
Why don't I
just eat a gun?

20:34.433 --> 20:37.034
Well... I'll tell you,
professor,

20:37.035 --> 20:39.604
and this may come off
as a little insensitive,

20:39.605 --> 20:42.940
considering the 90% of mankind
that's already gone to the grave.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.576
But the arrival
of these evil creatures

20:45.577 --> 20:48.880
is the best damn thing
that's ever happened to me.

20:48.881 --> 20:53.084
See, we've been on a bug hunt
the last six months,

20:53.085 --> 20:56.077
and we've been
having a blast.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.789
- Maggie. Is that your name?
- No.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.191
Huh.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.893
I could have sworn

21:01.894 --> 21:03.461
I heard him say
that your name was Maggie.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.630
You heard wrong.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.632
I want you
to consider something.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.534
And I want you to shut up.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.702
You should join us.
We're fighting back.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.203
Shut up... now.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.705
Are you stupid?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.150
I figured
it was worth a shot.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.619
You do anything
like that again,

21:28.620 --> 21:31.120
and I will use the gun.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.126
[gun cocks]
Get up.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.627
[groans]

21:41.767 --> 21:44.267
Turn around.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.406
Bag.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.647
Walk.

21:59.518 --> 22:03.545
What do you call them...
spidery bastards?

22:03.622 --> 22:06.182
- Skitters.
- That's good.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.192
We call them cooties,
you know,

22:08.193 --> 22:11.492
like the, uh...
Kids' game.

22:11.563 --> 22:14.232
Well,
before the cooties came,

22:14.233 --> 22:17.235
I was always going up
against cops

22:17.236 --> 22:19.604
and, you know,
people like me.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.773
But you go around killing people
today, even the bad guys,

22:22.774 --> 22:24.875
and people tend to get
a bit uptight.

22:24.876 --> 22:28.676
But cooties...
it's open season on them.

22:28.747 --> 22:32.114
You killed any?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.584
A few.

22:33.585 --> 22:34.619
How?

22:34.620 --> 22:35.920
Rifle.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.588
Shoot for the head?

22:37.589 --> 22:39.590
It seems to do the trick.

22:39.591 --> 22:41.592
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you, friend,

22:41.593 --> 22:43.227
but you've been going
about it all wrong!

22:43.228 --> 22:44.996
[laughs]

22:44.997 --> 22:46.797
You don't shoot
for the head.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.000
You take out
a couple of legs.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.335
You slow them down.
It weakens them.

22:51.336 --> 22:54.396
Then you take
the head shot.

22:54.473 --> 22:57.931
You ever go one-on-one?

22:58.010 --> 23:01.810
This one I did solo.

23:01.880 --> 23:06.400
Thought I was gonna die,
but I didn't... it did.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.750
You ever take down a ship?

23:10.822 --> 23:13.791
The cooties
and their robot friends

23:13.792 --> 23:15.393
respond to sound, right?

23:15.394 --> 23:18.262
The ships... they go off heat.
You know that?

23:18.263 --> 23:19.764
Mm-hmm.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.832
Well, we raided
the armory, right?

23:21.833 --> 23:24.902
We got ourselves
a genuine bazooka, right?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.771
And we're like,
"all right."

23:26.772 --> 23:28.806
So we... we peel
this engine block

23:28.807 --> 23:31.909
out of an old Volkswagen, right,
and we set it on fire.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.011
It gets hot enough,
magnesium just, you know,

23:34.012 --> 23:36.180
ignites, like staring
into the heart of the sun.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.541
Having a few beers,
lo and behold...

23:39.918 --> 23:43.081
in comes
this airship, right?

23:43.155 --> 23:46.386
Billy takes a bazooka,

23:46.458 --> 23:49.160
gets a cootie bird
in its sights,

23:49.161 --> 23:50.328
lets a shell fly.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.896
It arcs.

23:51.897 --> 23:55.199
I mean, it's going...
I don't know.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.169
The ship must have sensed
something, right?

23:58.170 --> 23:59.837
It must have sensed it,

23:59.838 --> 24:02.540
'cause it... it just deked
out of the way.

24:02.541 --> 24:05.999
That would've been sweet.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.445
[clears throat]

24:07.446 --> 24:10.882
Hey, you think
I could have a beer?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.449
Why the hell not?

24:14.353 --> 24:16.853
Don't go anywhere.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.323
[insects chirping]

24:26.231 --> 24:28.731
You've got one hour.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.011
ANNE:
Do you know them?

24:43.982 --> 24:46.482
No.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.552
Wonder what happened
to them.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.591
As far as I heard,
people from this area

24:53.592 --> 24:58.188
were herded to the camp
in Stockton.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.597
Then nuked.

24:59.598 --> 25:01.265
After the kids
were taken.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.933
What can I do
for you, doc?

25:02.934 --> 25:06.303
I had some more thoughts
on the housing.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.539
Mm.
You're still on that.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.374
Actually, yes, 'cause
it's still not fair.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.009
You back already?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.544
We have a problem.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.146
Where's your father?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.843
Don't do
anything stupid.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.181
Come on,
I just want a beer.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.753
[groans]

25:26.057 --> 25:27.458
It's cold.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.155
Yeah.
Ain't we civilized?

25:30.228 --> 25:32.163
Got ourselves
and old, uh, fridge there

25:32.164 --> 25:35.224
running off our genny.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.800
Yeah.

25:38.270 --> 25:42.072
So, he your only kid,
the one I sent back to town?

25:42.073 --> 25:43.974
No, I have two other boys.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.910
They with you?

25:45.911 --> 25:48.879
One is.
The other one's harnessed.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.015
Damn.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.117
You know where he is?

25:53.118 --> 25:55.352
Yeah, he was seen
in a group

25:55.353 --> 25:58.055
a couple days ago,
headed this way.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.590
Well, you know,

25:59.591 --> 26:01.225
Maggie saw some of them
down by the hospital.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.326
Maybe he's with them.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.057
You know, if I were you...

26:05.130 --> 26:07.131
I would find him,

26:07.132 --> 26:09.066
and I would put him
out of his misery.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.134
That's no way to live.

26:10.135 --> 26:13.127
You have kids?

26:13.205 --> 26:15.306
Boy and a girl.

26:15.307 --> 26:20.244
They, uh... they're with
their mother in Florida.

26:20.312 --> 26:24.252
I suppose I should use
the past tense now.

26:25.050 --> 26:28.419
So, when you gonna do it?
When you gonna make your move?

26:28.420 --> 26:31.150
Excuse me?

26:31.223 --> 26:34.425
You've been, uh,
eyeballing Billy's sidearm

26:34.426 --> 26:36.926
since you got here.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.164
That obvious, huh?

26:40.165 --> 26:41.632
I tend to notice
little things like that.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.069
You know...
Here, I'm thinking

26:45.136 --> 26:48.439
we're having
this good conversation,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.941
yet you had
ulterior motives.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.442
What would you do?

26:57.048 --> 26:59.548
[gun cocks]

27:02.420 --> 27:03.988
So, you don't have

27:03.989 --> 27:06.056
a lot of good conversation
with your men, huh?

27:06.057 --> 27:08.158
You kidding?

27:08.159 --> 27:11.462
Last book any of them read
had a dog named Spot in it.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.664
Maybe you should join us.

27:13.665 --> 27:16.315
- Join who?
- The resistance.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.928
[laughs]
You kidding?

27:19.004 --> 27:20.538
And why would I do that?

27:20.539 --> 27:23.440
I can guarantee
good conversation.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.142
And what do you get?

27:25.143 --> 27:28.412
Apparently, you know
how to kill Skitters.

27:28.413 --> 27:30.648
You know what,
professor?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.316
You kill me.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.218
I don't know what kind
of fairy tales you've got

27:34.219 --> 27:37.087
going on in that head of yours
about saving the earth,

27:37.088 --> 27:39.156
but the way I see it...

27:39.157 --> 27:43.307
there ain't no place
this is going but down.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.698
HAL:
One's bleeding out.
Click shot him in the leg.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.266
You mean before he died?

27:49.267 --> 27:51.035
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

27:51.036 --> 27:52.636
Mike, get in here.

27:52.637 --> 27:55.039
Do you need me to leave?

27:55.040 --> 27:57.308
No. You stay.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.177
Tom and his team were taken
hostage by a gang of outlaws.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.445
Click's dead.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.681
It wasn't my dad's fault,
all right?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.082
It was a trap.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.650
Yeah, they want
to make a deal.

28:06.651 --> 28:11.461
We give them the.50,
they give us Tom and his team.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.359
How do we
make the trade?

28:15.360 --> 28:18.158
We don't.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.597
What?

28:19.598 --> 28:21.532
You don't understand
what's happening, do you?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.634
We start negotiating with them,
they will bleed us dry,

28:23.635 --> 28:26.070
if they don't just hit us now,
which they probably will.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.738
Schlatter and O'Neill,
get in here!

28:27.739 --> 28:29.340
You go wake up
your civilians.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.175
They need to be ready
to move in 10.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.577
Oh... oh,
we're just gonna run?

28:33.578 --> 28:36.347
You want to go fight them?
Me too.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.816
You have any idea
where they are?

28:38.817 --> 28:41.218
You had a bag
on your head.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.487
They were in an auditorium.
It looked like a school.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.756
Oh, do you have any idea how
many schools there are in Acton?

28:45.757 --> 28:48.521
Because I don't.

28:48.593 --> 28:52.296
All right, we'll just go
to this factory that you found.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.797
It's gonna have to do.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.535
The guy put a gun
to my father's head.

28:58.536 --> 28:59.837
He's gonna kill him.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.705
If all I had were fighters,

29:02.774 --> 29:04.541
we would go
and we would find him,

29:04.542 --> 29:06.510
but I have 200 civilians
to worry about.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.412
Now, after we get
all of them safe,

29:08.413 --> 29:10.214
we will go look
for your father.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.615
I'm going now.

29:11.616 --> 29:12.783
No, you're not.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.252
Mike, take him next door.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.287
Watch him
'til it's time to go.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.657
Sound the alarm.
We're moving out.

29:19.658 --> 29:22.158
Civilians.

29:22.193 --> 29:25.594
Please, Mike,
you got to let me go.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.398
It's a damn shame.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.766
I know, but it doesn't have
to be.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.736
I meant...
It's a damn shame

29:31.803 --> 29:36.723
how you were able to overpower
me and take my weapon.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.477
Should I hit you, like,
make it look good?

29:40.478 --> 29:42.513
No.
No, you should not hit me.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.682
Just...
just block the door.

29:44.683 --> 29:47.675
All right.

29:47.752 --> 29:49.353
I'm gonna leave
your rifle here.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.854
No, take it.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.589
That girl
that brought me here...

29:52.590 --> 29:57.290
if she saw me with a gun,
I think she'd shoot me.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.663
I may be able to help you.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.741
Okay.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.506
Where is she?

30:13.578 --> 30:16.376
I don't know.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.782
Where's the.50?

30:20.452 --> 30:22.019
I'm a doctor.

30:22.020 --> 30:26.280
I understand one of your men
is badly wounded.

30:27.425 --> 30:30.194
I take you there,
you may never leave.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.221
It's all we've got.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.135
[groans]

30:38.136 --> 30:39.570
POPE:
Is it bad or wicked bad?

30:39.571 --> 30:41.038
Oh, it's wicked bad, bro.

30:41.039 --> 30:42.606
Do you want me
to load you up again?

30:42.607 --> 30:45.042
Yeah, man, dose me up.
Dose me up.

30:45.043 --> 30:48.342
[door opens, closes]

30:48.413 --> 30:51.715
Oh, this does not look like
it's gonna make me very happy.

30:51.716 --> 30:54.051
You tell me you have
that GTO in the parking lot,

30:54.052 --> 30:57.572
or I am gonna be very...
disappointed.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.227
I'm a doctor.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.129
I might be able
to help your brother.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.630
What kind of doctor?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.368
The only one you've got.
Is that him?

31:11.369 --> 31:13.869
Hold on.

31:22.647 --> 31:26.107
If I fix him,
will you let us leave?

31:26.151 --> 31:27.451
You fix him,
I'll let you live.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.952
[gasps]

31:36.694 --> 31:38.162
[groaning]

31:38.163 --> 31:39.396
- Whoa.
- What... what happened?

31:39.397 --> 31:41.298
Easy, easy.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.667
Dr. Quinn, medicine woman, here
just stitched up your artery.

31:43.668 --> 31:44.868
She stopped the bleeding.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.537
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

31:46.538 --> 31:47.738
You got the tube?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.139
Yeah.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.808
- How about the shells?
- Yep.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.709
BILLY:
Where you going?

31:52.710 --> 31:54.678
To rob
the 2nd Massachusetts.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.113
You sit this one out.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.281
Yeah, you think?

31:57.282 --> 31:58.816
I'm leaving you, Maggie,
and Cueball.

31:58.817 --> 32:01.837
Anybody tries anything,
pop them.

32:04.155 --> 32:05.722
Hey, you know me, huh?

32:05.723 --> 32:08.292
Yeah, that's why I'm leaving
Maggie and Cueball...

32:08.293 --> 32:10.160
so you don't do it
just for laughs.

32:10.161 --> 32:12.751
BILLY:
Well, that's no fun!

32:18.736 --> 32:21.805
- Everyone move this way!
- Let me try to understand this.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.473
I'm supposed to believe

32:23.474 --> 32:25.209
that you let a 17-year-old
get the better of you?

32:25.210 --> 32:26.777
Is that what I'm
supposed to believe?

32:26.778 --> 32:29.213
When we get safe and settled,
there will be consequences.

32:29.214 --> 32:30.480
[explosion]

32:30.481 --> 32:33.177
[indistinct shouting]

32:33.251 --> 32:36.086
Defensive positions!
Far tree line now!

32:36.087 --> 32:38.612
[indistinct conversations]

32:47.799 --> 32:50.299
You in charge?

32:50.335 --> 32:52.669
I am.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.638
You the one
took my fighters?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.273
I did.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.375
You better tell your people

32:58.376 --> 33:00.244
to put down the weapons
and run.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.745
Like hell.

33:04.382 --> 33:06.083
If I give the signal,

33:06.084 --> 33:09.734
my guys will open up
on your civilians.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.791
You give any kind
of signal whatsoever,

33:14.792 --> 33:16.593
it'll be the last thing
that you do.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.662
Listen, chief.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.231
A patrol ship is gonna pick up
on those flares,

33:21.232 --> 33:22.666
and when they do,

33:22.667 --> 33:25.369
they're not gonna fire nukes,
but they will hit hard,

33:25.370 --> 33:29.033
and anyone still left
in this meadow...

33:29.107 --> 33:31.275
will be killed.

33:31.276 --> 33:34.236
I'm not asking
for your rifles.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.780
I got enough of that to last me
the next 10 years.

33:36.781 --> 33:40.651
All I'm asking for is the food
you have right now,

33:40.652 --> 33:44.588
the.50 cal,
and that sweet little GTO.

33:44.656 --> 33:50.151
In exchange, I give you
your friends back.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.502
Leave the food.

34:01.572 --> 34:02.839
Go!

34:02.840 --> 34:04.708
MAN:
Yes, sir.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.843
[indistinct conversations]

34:06.844 --> 34:09.344
I will get you.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.956
Get up.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.695
He's talking to you.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.302
I said get up!

34:34.639 --> 34:37.139
BILLY:
That's it.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.610
Now turn around.

34:40.610 --> 34:44.261
I want to see what we got.
[chuckles]

34:45.882 --> 34:48.716
Look at you.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.286
You are a pretty one.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.726
We're gonna have ourselves
a good time, you know that?

34:56.728 --> 34:59.228
Hey.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.298
Is Billy gonna live?

35:01.299 --> 35:04.291
What?

35:04.369 --> 35:07.704
Yes, uh, if he
doesn't get infected.

35:07.705 --> 35:10.374
Hey, what are you
asking her that... ugh!

35:10.375 --> 35:12.875
Ugh!

35:17.348 --> 35:22.342
After they grabbed me
three months ago, Billy...

35:22.420 --> 35:26.584
let's just say
he deserved to die.

35:26.657 --> 35:30.427
Cueball thought he was better
'cause he brought chocolate.

35:30.428 --> 35:32.928
He wasn't.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.872
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!

35:41.873 --> 35:43.907
Let's go! Ándale!

35:43.908 --> 35:45.042
Just leave it!
Let's go!

35:45.043 --> 35:47.543
[machine-gun fire]

35:52.517 --> 35:53.817
All right,
what's that?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.152
Who's firing
those guns?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.853
ANNE:
It's Tom.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.889
You have to get everyone
to follow us.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.624
Take them, Mike.
Take them.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.125
Let's go.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.496
What the...

36:11.536 --> 36:14.471
Take the.50 now!

36:21.179 --> 36:24.012
All right,
on the.50!

36:24.082 --> 36:26.582
Go!

36:28.886 --> 36:33.983
Cease fire, cease fire,
cease fire!

36:34.058 --> 36:36.126
Can you hear me, Pope?!

36:36.127 --> 36:39.196
My ears are still ringing,
but... yeah!

36:39.197 --> 36:41.932
Those my own guns
you're firing at me?!

36:41.933 --> 36:44.629
They are!

36:44.702 --> 36:47.070
You better run,
professor!

36:47.071 --> 36:49.539
Ships are gonna target
the flares.

36:49.540 --> 36:53.874
You're in the middle
of the flares.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.645
What are my options?

36:55.646 --> 36:57.147
Join or die.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.149
- Just like the revolution, huh?
- Just like.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.084
Well, tell you what...
why don't we just sit tight?

37:01.085 --> 37:04.821
We'll see how the, uh...
see how the air strikes go.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.857
If that's how you want
to play it.

37:06.858 --> 37:10.624
I drive,
you follow close, okay?

37:10.695 --> 37:12.996
They can't see you,
they can't shoot you.

37:12.997 --> 37:15.497
[airship approaching]

37:17.602 --> 37:20.102
[engine turns over]

37:38.789 --> 37:41.224
Well, I guess you got me
after all.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.725
Get out.

37:45.129 --> 37:47.764
One wrong move,
I take your head off.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.265
I believe you would.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.237
Come on!

37:57.008 --> 37:59.875
[birds chirping]

37:59.944 --> 38:02.811
[indistinct conversations]

38:02.880 --> 38:06.179
Captain.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.951
You get Click's body?

38:07.952 --> 38:10.614
We did.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.188
We'll bury him tomorrow.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.094
WEAVER:
This was no good today.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.764
We almost lost you,
your squad,

38:20.765 --> 38:23.166
and Hal and Anne
were reckless.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.168
Hal's young.

38:25.169 --> 38:28.271
He just did what he did
to save his father.

38:28.272 --> 38:29.973
Anne's a civilian,

38:29.974 --> 38:32.642
and we don't want
lose our doctor.

38:32.643 --> 38:36.313
As for you, you got your team
taken hostage.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.217
We almost lost our best weapon
and a lot of our food.

38:40.218 --> 38:44.187
And we almost lost them
to a bunch of criminals

38:44.188 --> 38:46.623
with AKs
and road flares.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.958
This time, it worked out,

38:47.959 --> 38:50.660
but there's a reason
we have a chain of command,

38:50.661 --> 38:53.296
and you better damn well
make sure people follow it.

38:53.297 --> 38:56.166
You can start
when you get back.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.727
Thanks.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.037
I said you could go look
for your son

39:01.038 --> 39:03.106
after you checked out
the armory.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.342
Do you have any idea
where he is?

39:05.343 --> 39:08.645
Uh, that woman that was
with Pope... Margaret...

39:08.646 --> 39:10.847
said she saw some harnessed kids
out by a hospital.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.048
I thought we'd start there.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.783
I'll give you three days.

39:13.784 --> 39:14.918
[knock on door]

39:14.919 --> 39:17.187
Well, good.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.155
And there's something you can do
before you leave.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.124
There's your prisoner
right here.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.059
His cell
should be ready by now.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.756
Go ahead and escort him.

39:28.399 --> 39:31.001
What are you
gonna do with me?

39:31.002 --> 39:33.136
Oh, that hasn't been
decided yet.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.838
What about Maggie?

39:34.839 --> 39:37.907
She wants to earn her
citizenship in the 2nd Mass

39:37.908 --> 39:39.075
by being a fighter.

39:39.076 --> 39:42.326
Should've taken me up
on my offer.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.181
And join
your tattered remnants?

39:45.182 --> 39:47.117
I'll take a rest
for a little while.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.853
Being the leader of a
post-apocalyptic gang of outlaws

39:49.854 --> 39:52.354
has been exhausting.

39:59.964 --> 40:01.131
Hey.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.134
Thanks for coming today
with Hal.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.002
You'd do it for me.

40:06.003 --> 40:07.971
Yeah, I would.

40:07.972 --> 40:09.139
Dad.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.240
Got to go.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.241
Good sticks?

40:11.242 --> 40:13.243
Not bad.

40:13.244 --> 40:17.134
Ready for that game of catch
you promised?

40:18.015 --> 40:20.016
There you go.
Good throw.

40:20.017 --> 40:22.018
[indistinct conversations]

40:22.019 --> 40:24.519
Good catch.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.258
That's it.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.131
Got to work
on your off hand.

40:35.132 --> 40:37.801
My off hand's
better than yours.

40:37.802 --> 40:39.502
I wasn't talking to you.
[laughs]

40:39.503 --> 40:43.064
Our old man...
he's losing that form.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.908
Pick this up
when we get back.

40:44.909 --> 40:46.776
Gonna go find Ben?

40:46.777 --> 40:49.179
That's the plan.
We're gonna bring him back, too.

40:49.180 --> 40:53.830
So why don't you go inside
and get a little rest?

40:55.419 --> 40:57.919
Which way?

40:58.305 --> 41:04.377
