<i>Previously on</i> Camelot...

00:03.386 --> 00:06.316
How it was... between us.
I've never known that before.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.684
But I need you to know...
I love you.

00:08.751 --> 00:12.621
Leontes loves Guinevere
more than life itself.

00:12.689 --> 00:16.734
A wedge between Arthur and his
champion could bring it all down.

00:16.802 --> 00:20.370
- You keep yourself too alone.
- Why does it bother you?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.869
Because sometimes
I see glimpses

00:22.937 --> 00:25.639
of the man you might be.

00:25.707 --> 00:29.180
She covets Arthur's throne.
Where are you?

00:29.248 --> 00:32.015
Tell me what I have to do.

00:32.083 --> 00:37.450
You said I'd been given the gift
for a reason. Now I know what it is.

00:37.517 --> 00:39.183
Do you really think

00:39.251 --> 00:41.318
that the king will not wonder
where I am?

00:41.386 --> 00:44.990
I know he won't.

00:45.057 --> 00:49.026
- It's good to be home.
- Yes. It is.

Shall I wake Morgan?

05:20.343 --> 05:22.645
Sit down.

05:26.984 --> 05:29.719
How absolute is
your loyalty?

05:29.786 --> 05:31.320

To Morgan.

05:33.657 --> 05:36.258
And to everyone
within these walls.

05:36.326 --> 05:40.329
I've served here
most of my life.

05:40.397 --> 05:43.165
Morgan requests
that you accept my instructions

05:43.233 --> 05:44.667
without question.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.736
Where is she?

05:53.677 --> 05:55.612
At Camelot.

05:55.679 --> 05:59.282
The land is falling towards disarray.
There are matters

05:59.350 --> 06:01.951
she must resolve
with her brother.

06:03.921 --> 06:05.855
In the meantime,

06:05.922 --> 06:08.758
I need someone

06:19.301 --> 06:20.901
...before.

06:20.969 --> 06:24.304
You were right.
I...

06:24.372 --> 06:26.974
...could be more open.

06:28.810 --> 06:32.246
I'm...
out of practice.

06:34.816 --> 06:37.751
You can always practice
with me.

06:37.819 --> 06:40.288
Maybe I will.

Get someone.

07:38.512 --> 07:42.480
You and I are the only ones
to know about this.

07:42.548 --> 07:46.184
You swore that your loyalty
to Morgan was absolute.

07:46.251 --> 07:48.285
Now prove it.

08:05.001 --> 08:07.436
...bedchambers...

08:07.504 --> 08:09.772
My lady.
Good morning.

08:11.675 --> 08:14.077
- Good morning.
- Leontes.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.913
Lady Igraine.

08:17.816 --> 08:20.118
Good morning.

08:24.957 --> 08:26.891
Excuse me,
milady,

08:26.959 --> 08:28.926
where would you like
these?

08:28.994 --> 08:32.195
Uh,
the usual place will be fine.

08:34.164 --> 08:37.099
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.900
Good morning,
milady.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.770
- Good morning.
- Oh, I put your shawl back.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.372
I saw.
Thank you.

08:48.143 --> 08:50.111
Madame.

08:50.178 --> 08:51.713
Good morning.

08:53.648 --> 08:55.883
Yes, of course. I'll tell
the men, Your Highness.

08:55.951 --> 08:59.220
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Arthur.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.756
I never thanked you
for your support

09:01.824 --> 09:03.725
the other night
during the attack.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.727
It was exactly
what I needed.

09:06.795 --> 09:08.896
Of course.

09:25.479 --> 09:28.482
Good morning,
Guinevere.

09:47.102 --> 09:49.037
You don't have
to do that.

09:49.104 --> 09:52.040
- I like doing it.
- Can I help?

09:52.107 --> 09:54.008
Thank you.

09:57.780 --> 10:00.582
What I said...

10:00.650 --> 10:02.283
...at Pendragon...

10:02.351 --> 10:04.519
I know.

10:04.586 --> 10:07.355
I shouldn't have
said it.

10:07.422 --> 10:09.924
But I did mean it.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.729
You kissed me.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.905
On our journey back, after
your father's death.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.304
It was grief.

10:21.937 --> 10:24.172
I buried everything
until that moment.

10:26.075 --> 10:28.776
I'm sorry.

10:28.844 --> 10:31.646
But it will never happen.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.983
I know.

10:40.956 --> 10:42.790
I'm sorry
for telling you.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.528
I'm glad you did.

10:55.137 --> 10:58.639
Igraine?
Igraine!

11:00.508 --> 11:03.911
Where have you been?
What do you mean?

11:03.979 --> 11:05.580
I've been waiting.

11:05.647 --> 11:09.283
Of course.
How rude of me! I'm sorry.

11:09.350 --> 11:12.519
I... had an errand
to run.

11:20.229 --> 11:22.898
Camelot's in danger.
Only you can save us,

11:22.965 --> 11:25.000
Sir Redwald,
my brave and true knight.

11:25.067 --> 11:26.839
Fear not, my Lady Igraine,

11:26.864 --> 11:29.237
for I am your champion and
Camelot will be saved.

11:29.405 --> 11:32.407
That's supposed to be me.
He's an orphan, too.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.678
- Of course.
- I faced down our enemy's

11:36.745 --> 11:38.913
toughest warrior,
and bested him. For you.

11:38.981 --> 11:40.715
All for you.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.218
Um. OK. Oh...

11:44.286 --> 11:47.522
Um...
OK...

11:47.590 --> 11:52.228
Uh, you are a truly brave champion.
How can I ever repay you?

11:52.295 --> 11:56.165
Now we shall be married
and live together forever.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.600
That's the end, really.

11:57.668 --> 12:00.103
Well, I love a story
with a happy ending.

12:00.171 --> 12:02.406
And that one is
very happy.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.275
When I get older,

12:04.342 --> 12:06.977
we'll really marry, and
you can be my queen for real.

12:07.045 --> 12:08.980
Hmm.

12:09.048 --> 12:12.219
I think that, um, I might be
a little too old for you.

12:12.225 --> 12:14.535
I don't mind.
I'm very grown up.

12:15.086 --> 12:18.021
Well,
that's all right, then.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.756
Are you lonely?

12:24.060 --> 12:26.362
Why...
why would you ask that?

12:26.430 --> 12:28.632
Your eyes look
so sad today.

12:37.009 --> 12:38.943
How could I be lonely

12:39.011 --> 12:41.045
when I have a friend
like you?

12:53.860 --> 12:55.327
Please.

12:55.395 --> 12:57.796
Tell me
why I'm here.

13:02.669 --> 13:05.104
When Morgan returned here,

13:05.172 --> 13:07.907
when her father rejected her,

13:07.975 --> 13:10.076
why didn't you speak for her?

13:10.144 --> 13:12.579
Why didn't you convince him
to give her another chance?

13:12.647 --> 13:14.381
Is that what this is?

13:14.449 --> 13:18.152
Punishment...
for that day?

13:18.220 --> 13:21.890
We are all the victims
of our own actions.

13:21.958 --> 13:25.393
It is your own decisions
that have brought you here.

13:25.461 --> 13:28.429
Perhaps if you were
to confess,

13:28.496 --> 13:30.931
you would find solace.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.899
Confess what?

13:32.967 --> 13:36.403
That is for you
to decide.

13:36.470 --> 13:40.206
But there can be
no salvation without it.

13:40.274 --> 13:42.241
When they find me,

13:42.309 --> 13:45.211
when I'm rescued,

13:45.279 --> 13:47.446
you will be the one
that needs forgiveness.

13:47.514 --> 13:50.049
My soul is
without stain.

13:50.117 --> 13:51.517
Really?

13:54.956 --> 13:56.890
Only one of us

13:56.958 --> 14:00.528
whored herself
and sired a bastard.

14:02.664 --> 14:04.966
Guards! Guards!

14:05.033 --> 14:06.267
Guards!

14:06.335 --> 14:09.637
Get her off me!
I will kill her!

14:09.705 --> 14:12.307
No you won't.
Don't make me cut you.

14:22.686 --> 14:27.022
You had your chance,
but you couldn't take it.

14:39.501 --> 14:42.603
Stay outside the room.
Keep the door locked.

14:42.671 --> 14:44.205
Do not talk to her.

14:44.273 --> 14:46.607
Do not listen to her. Do not
accede to any of her requests.

14:46.675 --> 14:49.611
Should she cause
further trouble,

14:49.678 --> 14:52.213
you may use force,
at your discretion.

14:54.550 --> 14:56.952
- Do you have any questions?
- No.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.689
Good.

14:59.756 --> 15:01.658
Come along,
Vivian.

15:01.725 --> 15:04.093
I know you have your doubts,
child.

15:04.161 --> 15:06.396
But Morgan will return
when she has dealt

15:06.463 --> 15:08.764
with the darkness
at the heart of Camelot.

15:08.832 --> 15:11.967
What darkness?
What is she doing?

15:12.035 --> 15:13.935
Have patience, child.

15:14.003 --> 15:16.671
Everything will fall
into place.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.450
- Here they come.
- I'm telling you,

15:29.518 --> 15:30.985
she really liked me.

15:31.053 --> 15:33.888
She said she'd come and visit!
And who is this?

15:33.956 --> 15:36.826
One of the dancers from the
other night at Pendragon.

15:36.893 --> 15:39.028
Brastias is in love.
I'm not in love!

15:39.096 --> 15:41.297
But... we had a connection.
Oh, we know.

15:41.365 --> 15:43.500
We could hear it
out in the courtyard.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.169
Somebody change the subject.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.172
Tell them what we were discussing.
Six minds are better than 2.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.173
Well, 5 minds
plus Brastias.

15:51.241 --> 15:55.244
- On what?
- On what we're working towards.

15:55.312 --> 15:58.581
If we're going to achieve anything,
it has to live long after us.

15:58.649 --> 16:01.784
It's not enough that we lead.
We have to change how people think.

16:01.852 --> 16:04.720
- How are we going to do that?
- It has to be through the people.

16:04.788 --> 16:07.323
They're the constant,
what they pass on

16:07.390 --> 16:10.326
to their children about how to live.
Lads, with respect,

16:10.393 --> 16:12.328
are we talking,
or are we hunting?

16:12.395 --> 16:14.897
Remember, one thing at a time.

16:14.965 --> 16:17.566
That was Brastias's
dancer's complaint, as well.

16:17.634 --> 16:20.403
Brastias, Gawain, Ulfius,

16:20.471 --> 16:22.705
you take the ridge line.
We'll stay down low.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.041
Pheasant, hare, boar,
whatever you can find.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.076
Greatest number wins.

16:27.144 --> 16:30.279
- Taking charge again, Leontes?
- Working as a unit, Gawain.

16:30.347 --> 16:32.515
You're not going to get more
than us! You've never managed

16:32.582 --> 16:35.251
more than us. With respect,
Your Highness.

16:35.319 --> 16:37.921
We'll meet back here
at sundown, with our catch.

16:37.989 --> 16:40.024
We'll see who's better.
Fair enough.

17:15.794 --> 17:18.896
I had more...
thoughts. Hm!

17:21.599 --> 17:23.300
I like it.

17:23.367 --> 17:27.305
- Hm!
- Yes.

17:27.373 --> 17:28.807
So,

17:28.875 --> 17:31.844
what are you going to do?
About what?

17:31.912 --> 17:33.480
Morgan.

17:33.547 --> 17:36.817
How do you know
that's what I'm thinking about?

17:38.854 --> 17:40.754
I could just leave her
to her tricks

17:40.822 --> 17:42.456
like the other night.

17:42.524 --> 17:44.592
How do you know
it was a trick?

17:44.660 --> 17:46.927
She was toying with us,
watching us,

17:46.995 --> 17:49.596
seeing
how we'd react.

17:49.664 --> 17:51.431
Why would she do that?

17:51.499 --> 17:53.532
The crown.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.229
Whatever she says,
she still wants it.

17:55.254 --> 17:57.440
She'll never forgive
either of us for Arthur.

18:01.307 --> 18:05.877
Do you think that maybe you're
getting a little obsessed with her?

18:05.944 --> 18:07.912
Or...

18:07.980 --> 18:11.249
...perhaps
you're attracted to her?

18:11.316 --> 18:13.918
There we go.
You've seen right through me.

18:13.986 --> 18:16.388
I'm besotted
with her.

18:16.455 --> 18:19.524
Uther would have said
go in there with our men,

18:19.592 --> 18:21.560
have her removed.

18:21.627 --> 18:23.195
Or executed.

18:23.263 --> 18:27.333
- On what grounds?
- Ah, we wouldn't need grounds.

18:27.401 --> 18:30.403
Accidents happen.

18:30.471 --> 18:33.807
Remove your enemies
at the first opportunity.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.709
That was his approach.

18:35.777 --> 18:38.045
Then maybe
you're wiser than him.

18:38.113 --> 18:39.747
Or weaker.

18:39.815 --> 18:44.218
If she can kill her own father,
she's capable of anything.

18:44.286 --> 18:46.687
I don't see
why that's true.

18:49.123 --> 18:51.591
- He was your husband.
- Yes,

18:51.659 --> 18:54.694
and I wasn't blind
to his faults.

18:58.965 --> 19:02.568
When she came back
from the nunnery,

19:02.635 --> 19:04.937
Uther beat her

19:05.004 --> 19:08.240
in front of me.

19:08.308 --> 19:11.711
And then
he humiliated her.

19:14.683 --> 19:16.384
Rejected her.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.655
Forever.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.527
So, therefore, patricide.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.643
The age-old solution
to a family dispute.

19:28.364 --> 19:30.999
That's not
what I'm saying.

19:31.067 --> 19:34.036
I wish
she were here.

19:34.104 --> 19:35.871
What do you mean?

19:35.938 --> 19:37.873
I wish she could see
and understand

19:37.940 --> 19:40.476
what we're trying
to do.

19:40.543 --> 19:42.812
Like you have.

19:42.879 --> 19:46.248
But then,
you're twice the woman she is.

19:46.316 --> 19:49.753
Is that right?

19:49.820 --> 19:53.556
It's a shame, though.
I got it wrong.

19:53.624 --> 19:56.559
I thought,
once she saw...

19:56.627 --> 19:58.961
...she'd come to us.

19:59.029 --> 20:02.431
This is
where she belongs.

20:08.372 --> 20:10.306
But she made her choices,

20:10.374 --> 20:13.743
and they're the wrong ones.

20:13.811 --> 20:16.913
Did you bring the food?

20:16.980 --> 20:19.081
Food?

20:19.149 --> 20:21.183
Aren't we going
to surprise him?

20:23.153 --> 20:25.821
Oh! Of course.

20:25.889 --> 20:27.490
I forgot.

20:27.558 --> 20:29.025
Never mind.

20:29.092 --> 20:32.194
I'll get it, and then
I'll come and find you.

20:41.971 --> 20:44.439
It's been too long
since I've done this.

20:44.507 --> 20:46.741
Kay and I used to do it
all the time.

20:46.809 --> 20:50.011
It's one of the first things
I remember doing with my father.

20:50.079 --> 20:52.647
He used to take me out
hunting for boar.

20:52.715 --> 20:55.583
Did you catch it?

20:55.651 --> 20:58.320
He blooded me
from the animal.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.256
He told me
I'd now become a man.

21:01.324 --> 21:03.358
I was 5 at the time.

21:14.402 --> 21:16.436
I think
he's in place.

21:23.043 --> 21:27.379
Both shots hit the target.
We make a good team.

21:27.447 --> 21:29.081
Huh? Not bad.

21:29.148 --> 21:31.049
- Not bad at all.
- Good shot.

21:31.117 --> 21:34.052
- Thank you.
- Ah, my kill. Time for yours.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.589
Very nice.

22:04.952 --> 22:07.053
Are you ready?

22:15.694 --> 22:17.728
Just a moment.

22:29.405 --> 22:31.806
You should've seen her eyes,
Ulfius. As you slept,

22:31.874 --> 22:35.343
and he abstained,
I communed with a goddess.

22:35.411 --> 22:37.612
Now who's talking
when they should be hunting?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.114
You're right,
but she was gorgeous.

22:40.182 --> 22:43.117
Of course, Leontes took the
best ground for the king and himself.

22:43.184 --> 22:47.187
We'll not snare much up here.

22:47.255 --> 22:49.590
Well, maybe if we work
more with our ears,

22:49.658 --> 22:51.925
instead of our mouths,
we might stand a better chance.

22:51.993 --> 22:53.560
Wait. Look!

23:23.953 --> 23:26.054
You beauty.

23:43.202 --> 23:47.271
I don't understand.
Is everything all right?

23:47.338 --> 23:50.707
- Redwald, we need to talk.
- Did I do something wrong?

23:50.774 --> 23:53.675
I understand
you don't have a birthday.

23:53.743 --> 23:55.877
- No.
- That's not good.

23:55.945 --> 23:57.946
Everyone should have
a birthday.

23:58.013 --> 24:00.280
- I'm sorry.
- Igraine and I have been

24:00.348 --> 24:02.149
discussing it, and we feel

24:02.216 --> 24:06.352
the only solution is...

24:06.420 --> 24:10.156
...today must be
your birthday.

24:10.224 --> 24:14.260
And these...
are your gifts.

24:23.571 --> 24:26.573
Now you're officially
the king's man.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.909
Oh,
I almost forgot...

24:42.255 --> 24:44.422
They're beautiful.

24:48.660 --> 24:51.828
The king,

24:51.896 --> 24:55.265
his champion,
his mother.

24:58.736 --> 25:00.170
It's you.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.538
Yes.

25:02.606 --> 25:05.908
- Tell me the story.
- Again?

25:05.975 --> 25:07.576
You sure?

25:07.644 --> 25:11.280
- It's a good story.
- It is a good story.

25:11.348 --> 25:14.283
Once, in a land

25:14.351 --> 25:17.754
where the sun shone
all year,

25:17.821 --> 25:21.457
stood a place
called Camelot,

25:21.525 --> 25:23.459
where a boy king

25:23.527 --> 25:26.929
and his noble champion
and their warriors fought

25:26.997 --> 25:29.432
for the freedom
of their people.

25:29.499 --> 25:32.335
And in that place,

25:32.403 --> 25:36.406
every orphan was
offered shelter.

25:36.474 --> 25:40.210
And a boy named...
What was his name?

25:40.278 --> 25:41.712
Redwald!

25:41.779 --> 25:43.880
Yes, Redwald.

25:43.948 --> 25:47.384
Found a family, and grew up
to become the king's

25:47.451 --> 25:50.519
finest
and most fearsome warrior.

25:50.587 --> 25:52.087
You see,

25:52.155 --> 25:55.891
no one was ever without hope,
no matter who they were.

25:55.958 --> 26:01.562
Within Camelot was
a place for everyone.

26:05.934 --> 26:08.670
I know
that you can hear me.

26:10.740 --> 26:13.742
Have they told you
why I'm in here?

26:13.810 --> 26:16.005
I was leaving the castle,

26:16.030 --> 26:18.508
and they abducted me
and held me here.

26:18.582 --> 26:22.319
And now
you're helping them.

26:27.259 --> 26:29.393
I am
the king's mother!

26:29.461 --> 26:31.895
Do you understand
what will happen

26:31.963 --> 26:35.999
when he finds out
what's been done to me?

26:36.067 --> 26:38.002
Save your energy.

26:47.412 --> 26:51.281
Come on!

26:51.349 --> 26:53.483
There's no way
you shot that!

26:53.551 --> 26:55.618
Looks like
we're the victors, boys.

26:55.686 --> 26:58.955
No, no, you got lucky,
that's all!

26:59.022 --> 27:01.935
Keep telling yourself that,
Your Highness.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.497
Oh, Kay, this is for you.

27:07.565 --> 27:09.132
All right.

27:15.139 --> 27:18.042
All right, so we need
to be more than warriors.

27:18.109 --> 27:20.078
We need to bring every village
into the fold,

27:20.145 --> 27:22.714
somehow give them a say
in how they wish to be governed.

27:22.782 --> 27:25.917
You're talking about a senate,
like the Romans had.

27:25.984 --> 27:28.553
I don't know.
I suppose.

27:28.620 --> 27:31.556
What if each village or area
sent us a champion--

27:31.623 --> 27:35.125
someone they chose themselves?
To represent their cause.

27:35.193 --> 27:38.729
Yes, but ultimately
they'd be loyal to you.

27:38.796 --> 27:41.764
A council of champions.
I like it.

27:41.832 --> 27:45.869
Mm! So long as they're
better hunters than you 3.

27:45.937 --> 27:48.205
Oy!

27:48.273 --> 27:50.541
The man has a point.

27:56.683 --> 27:58.784
I'm not tired.

28:00.687 --> 28:02.321
Boys...

28:02.389 --> 28:04.490
...need their sleep.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.028
Champions need
their strength.

28:12.966 --> 28:17.802
Today was the best day.
Thank you.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.271
You sleep well.

28:20.339 --> 28:22.206
I love you, Igraine.

28:25.043 --> 28:27.144
Yes.

28:41.895 --> 28:43.862
You're good with him.

28:45.799 --> 28:47.232
Do you have children?

28:47.300 --> 28:50.069
Or did you? Before?

28:50.136 --> 28:52.070
Before what?

28:52.138 --> 28:54.439
Before this.

28:54.507 --> 28:57.541
You could be anywhere.
Do anything.

28:57.609 --> 28:59.810
Why here?

28:59.878 --> 29:01.979
Why this?

29:02.047 --> 29:05.983
I ran for a long time.
Sometimes you have to stop.

29:08.087 --> 29:10.154
That's not even
half an answer.

29:10.222 --> 29:12.156
No.

29:12.224 --> 29:14.993
No.
You're infuriating!

29:15.060 --> 29:17.495
- Me?
- Yes.

29:17.563 --> 29:20.198
Well, so ask me anything.
One question.

29:20.266 --> 29:22.335
I promise to answer.

29:28.776 --> 29:31.911
What do you think
about me?

29:31.979 --> 29:35.682
Why do you always have
to ask?

29:37.918 --> 29:39.852
Can't you see?

29:39.920 --> 29:42.088
No.

29:44.625 --> 29:48.495
There's so much about you
I don't know.

29:48.562 --> 29:51.999
And why is knowing
so important?

29:52.067 --> 29:54.454
How can we trust each other,

29:54.479 --> 29:57.668
if we don't know the truth
of who we are?

29:58.073 --> 30:00.341
Are you that fixed?

30:00.408 --> 30:02.776
So certain of who you are?

30:04.713 --> 30:06.381
Maybe.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.852
But how do you know
you won't change tomorrow?

30:12.821 --> 30:15.722
Hmm,
I'm sure I will.

30:15.790 --> 30:17.858
Ah.

30:25.967 --> 30:29.036
But I know
who I am tonight.

30:32.574 --> 30:34.975
And who is that?

30:35.043 --> 30:38.111
Someone
who wants you.

30:47.522 --> 30:50.191
What are you
so scared of?

30:50.258 --> 30:53.695
Losing control.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.869
Good night.

33:14.173 --> 33:15.607
No!

33:18.144 --> 33:20.278
- Are you all right?
- Oh!

33:20.346 --> 33:24.416
Oh. Redwald...

33:24.483 --> 33:26.884
- Your face changed.
- No, no. No...

33:26.952 --> 33:28.886
No.
You're not well.

33:32.658 --> 33:35.893
Redwald...

33:35.961 --> 33:38.930
Do you love me?

33:38.998 --> 33:41.633
Are you my champion?
Then this...

33:41.701 --> 33:44.136
...has to be our little secret.
Do you understand?

33:47.173 --> 33:49.208
You're not well.

33:52.111 --> 33:54.480
I'm fine!
I'm gonna get Merlin!

33:54.547 --> 33:57.383
No! No!

33:57.451 --> 34:00.219
No!

34:00.287 --> 34:01.954
No! No!

34:02.022 --> 34:04.190
Ah!

34:32.150 --> 34:34.119
Why didn't you kill it?

34:34.187 --> 34:36.422
'Cause it was
more than a wolf.

34:36.489 --> 34:39.425
- What do you mean?
- He means he lost his nerve.

34:39.493 --> 34:41.427
Might've known.

34:43.364 --> 34:44.998
Ulfius.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.167
It was close enough
to touch?

34:51.739 --> 34:55.175
Why do you think
it spared you?

34:55.243 --> 34:58.278
Because it has
another purpose for me.

35:19.099 --> 35:22.469
I found him
like this.

35:22.536 --> 35:24.671
Maybe he was
sleepwalking.

35:24.739 --> 35:27.441
Tripped and fell
and knew nothing about it.

35:33.614 --> 35:35.782
His clothes were torn.

35:37.752 --> 35:40.153
Maybe they ripped
on the boards as he fell.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.030
No.

35:49.098 --> 35:50.965
Someone knows what happened.

35:53.069 --> 35:55.804
Are you all right?

35:55.872 --> 35:57.806
Fine.

35:57.874 --> 36:00.810
You cared for him.

36:00.878 --> 36:03.847
I barely knew him.
How could I care for him?

36:03.915 --> 36:05.916
Merlin, you don't have
to pretend with me.

36:05.984 --> 36:09.419
...most amusing.

36:09.486 --> 36:12.054
Someone's hurt!
Quickly, we need some help!

36:12.122 --> 36:14.890
Whoever did this deserves
to burn.

36:14.958 --> 36:17.792
We need some help here!
Someone's hurt!

36:17.860 --> 36:20.395
And when I find out

36:20.463 --> 36:22.130
who it is,

36:22.197 --> 36:25.933
I'll light the pyre
myself.

36:26.001 --> 36:28.769
There's no redemption
for a person like this.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.792
Has the nun gone?

36:49.859 --> 36:51.994
Don't speak to me.

36:54.497 --> 36:56.632
It is Donal,
isn't it?

36:56.700 --> 37:01.537
I remember that your father used
to be the blacksmith here.

37:01.605 --> 37:03.539
And we remember you.

37:03.606 --> 37:07.209
The stuck-up queen
with no time for anyone.

37:12.749 --> 37:14.783
Well,
if that is true...

37:16.720 --> 37:18.654
...how would I know
your name?

37:18.721 --> 37:21.691
Do you think
that Morgan knows your name?

37:23.626 --> 37:26.995
Donal... please.

37:27.063 --> 37:30.065
Just listen to me,
just for a moment.

37:31.967 --> 37:34.635
Why would they lock up
the king's mother?

37:34.703 --> 37:37.504
Why?

37:37.572 --> 37:40.073
You know
there'll be trouble about this.

37:40.141 --> 37:42.442
The king will come
for me.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.229
I will get out of here,
and when I do,

37:44.254 --> 37:46.154
there will be a reckoning.
Help me.

37:46.180 --> 37:50.217
And I swear I will make sure
that the king spares you.

37:53.621 --> 37:55.922
That's it?

37:55.990 --> 37:58.625
That's all
you're offering?

37:58.693 --> 38:02.730
Possible
future clemency?

38:04.666 --> 38:08.870
Well, Donal, tell me what you want.
Tell me what it would take.

38:37.298 --> 38:39.199
Name it.

38:41.135 --> 38:44.437
Tell me
what I can give you.

38:44.504 --> 38:46.940
Poor boy.

38:47.007 --> 38:49.542
Brought up without a mother,
and then...

38:49.610 --> 38:53.780
...loses his father
in a battle against Lot.

38:53.848 --> 38:56.016
He found a home here.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.084
Yes, just like you.

38:58.152 --> 39:00.353
Like all of us.

39:02.289 --> 39:04.725
That's
what Arthur's building here.

39:04.793 --> 39:07.728
Tell me the truth.

39:07.796 --> 39:11.099
What happened
between you and Arthur?

39:11.166 --> 39:14.436
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.109
It was before
your wedding day, wasn't it?

39:22.046 --> 39:23.480
Igraine.

39:23.547 --> 39:26.483
I saw his face,
and yours that day.

39:26.550 --> 39:28.784
Something had happened.

39:33.156 --> 39:35.424
Why are you asking me this
now?

39:37.327 --> 39:40.728
Look at what happened
to Redwald.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.798
See how death stalks us
in life.

39:43.865 --> 39:45.799
How we must live

39:45.867 --> 39:49.236
every moment
for what we wish.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.273
I know what it is

39:52.341 --> 39:54.641
to live with regret,

39:54.709 --> 39:58.078
to wake up
years later,

39:58.146 --> 40:01.414
wishing that I'd done things
differently.

40:01.482 --> 40:04.283
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.256
I know a liar's eyes
when I see them.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.994
I see the way you talk
to Arthur, the way you stand,

40:13.061 --> 40:14.996
the longing
in your bodies.

40:15.064 --> 40:19.735
You're lucky that Leontes is
too blinded by love to see.

40:23.908 --> 40:26.977
It's destroying you,
isn't it? Share it.

40:31.316 --> 40:33.884
It was my wedding day.

40:35.820 --> 40:37.855
I had doubts.

40:41.494 --> 40:43.528
We were together.

40:45.464 --> 40:49.400
Please don't tell Leontes.
Of course not.

40:49.468 --> 40:53.437
You are a good
and faithful woman.

40:59.477 --> 41:02.646
And you made
the right decision.

41:08.119 --> 41:10.053
Swear you'll release me.

41:10.121 --> 41:12.623
Payment first.

41:30.376 --> 41:33.878
Oh!

41:33.946 --> 41:36.582
Ah!
Who's your king now?

41:36.649 --> 41:38.150
Arthur!

41:38.218 --> 41:40.820
Ah!

41:40.887 --> 41:43.222
Ah!

41:53.900 --> 41:56.535
Ah!

42:37.012 --> 42:39.313
Are you all right?

42:39.381 --> 42:41.449
I will be.

42:45.988 --> 42:49.524
Why would God want
to take Redwald from us?

42:49.591 --> 42:52.526
He doesn't
always give answers.

42:52.594 --> 42:55.663
All I can think is that he wished
Redwald to be by his side.

42:55.730 --> 42:58.465
You are a good man,
Leontes.

42:58.533 --> 43:01.168
Guinevere is lucky
to have you.

43:01.235 --> 43:04.204
A man with a...

43:04.271 --> 43:07.206
...big enough heart
to forgive.

43:07.274 --> 43:09.342
What do I have
to forgive?

43:12.278 --> 43:14.580
Arthur and Guinevere.

43:18.785 --> 43:20.719
What are you talking
about?

43:20.787 --> 43:24.102
Oh! Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

43:24.127 --> 43:25.527
I... I didn't realize
that you didn't--

43:25.558 --> 43:27.860
No, no, you didn't...
you didn't realize what?

43:27.927 --> 43:31.163
No, no, please, sorry.
I've embarrassed us both.

43:31.231 --> 43:34.367
Tell me
what you meant.

43:34.434 --> 43:36.703
Well, I thought
they told you.

43:36.771 --> 43:40.240
What happened between them
on your wedding day.

43:40.308 --> 43:42.743
What are you talking
about?

43:42.811 --> 43:45.213
Oh, God.

43:45.281 --> 43:48.416
Oh, I...
I'm so sorry!

43:48.484 --> 43:51.852
- Igraine. Igraine.
- I'm sorry.

45:21.408 --> 45:24.510
What are you doing
in here?

45:26.413 --> 45:28.481
I don't want
to be alone tonight.

45:37.324 --> 45:39.525
But when I touch,

45:39.593 --> 45:43.029
any contact,

45:43.097 --> 45:45.199
I see...

45:45.266 --> 45:47.167
...too much.

45:47.235 --> 45:50.938
I see
who people really are.

45:56.145 --> 45:58.146
What do you mean?

45:58.214 --> 46:00.649
Visions...

46:00.717 --> 46:03.252
...of their past
or future.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.421
Whatever their...

46:05.488 --> 46:07.489
...traumas are.

46:16.232 --> 46:18.533
Their secrets.

46:18.601 --> 46:21.169
I don't mind.

46:44.359 --> 46:46.360
What's the matter?

46:49.598 --> 46:52.166
Nothing.

46:52.234 --> 46:55.269
Because I have nothing
to hide.
