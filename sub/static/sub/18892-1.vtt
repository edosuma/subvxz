00:19.500 --> 00:22.454
This is Intercepter One, It's going down,

00:22.670 --> 00:25.245
I repeat, the Bogey is going down,

02:10.282 --> 02:13.118
Detail, attention!

02:26.592 --> 02:28.583
Yes, sir!

02:28.802 --> 02:30.924
You! You!

02:52.702 --> 02:54.860
Present arms!

03:13.555 --> 03:15.928
Present arms!

03:22.439 --> 03:27.150
- Sorry l used the security phone, sir.
- That's all right, Max.

03:27.364 --> 03:32.273
- My golf's not what it was.
- This sounds crazy. l think we have a...

03:32.491 --> 03:35.945
Max, what could be worse
than invading Europe?

03:36.164 --> 03:38.287
After you, sir.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.509
- Brief me.
- lt entered our air space last night.

03:50.761 --> 03:53.548
lt made a mockery of our intercepters.

03:53.764 --> 03:57.632
According to our pilots, it suffered
a malfunction and crashed in the desert.

03:57.853 --> 04:00.473
Was there a crew or any survivors?

04:00.690 --> 04:05.433
The egg-heads found the remains
of two creatures and pulled the engine out.

04:05.652 --> 04:07.942
They want time to study it.

04:08.154 --> 04:12.367
- Has the press gotten wind of this?
- We don't think so, sir.

04:12.576 --> 04:15.363
But we can't keep this on ice indefinitely.

04:19.332 --> 04:21.540
Get rid of it.

04:21.753 --> 04:23.709
Right away, sir.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.589
So, what l've attempted to do here

05:07.800 --> 05:12.925
is to instill in you a basic scientific curiosity
about the world we live in.

05:13.137 --> 05:16.343
Sherman, tell me about your science project.

05:16.559 --> 05:21.221
Mr Roberts, l've studied the accuracy
of the Gregorian calender

05:21.440 --> 05:23.727
in relation to the vernal equinox.

05:23.941 --> 05:26.943
Good. Ellie, tell me about yours.

05:27.153 --> 05:29.824
Well, Mr Roberts, l'm doing the...

05:30.032 --> 05:32.024
l want you to listen!

05:32.241 --> 05:36.240
l'm doing the effects of ultaviolet rays
on plant fungus.

05:36.455 --> 05:39.906
That's outta sight, Ellie.
Would you call me Bob?

05:40.125 --> 05:42.747
Only the pigs call me Mister.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.549
They're not getting away with it. Harlan!

05:51.763 --> 05:54.717
Why not tell us about your science project?

05:54.931 --> 05:56.640
What?

05:56.850 --> 06:00.719
This is science class.
Your science project?

06:04.067 --> 06:06.854
- l'm working on it.
- You're working on it?

06:15.955 --> 06:17.827
Hey, Mike.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.126
Ciao, babe!

06:27.591 --> 06:30.296
How is that, two weeks before graduation,

06:30.509 --> 06:35.304
a man of your mechanical capabilities
hasn't finished his science project?

06:35.518 --> 06:39.430
l've been working at Charlie's garage.
lt cuts into my free time.

06:39.645 --> 06:42.397
- Yeah.
- You know.

06:42.649 --> 06:47.310
l don't make the rules around here,
but bottom line, golden rule -

06:47.529 --> 06:50.149
no project, no diploma, babe.

06:50.365 --> 06:52.654
Oh, yeah.

06:52.866 --> 06:57.495
l thought l could, maybe,
rebuild a carburettor if that's OK.

06:57.707 --> 07:00.623
Come on, Harlan. You do that in your sleep.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.585
Do something special, something original.

07:03.795 --> 07:05.920
Come on, man.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.966
And don't forget your science final tomorrow.

07:09.176 --> 07:13.838
Hey, man. l don't like to hassle you, Mike.
Have a nice day.

07:14.097 --> 07:16.717
- Nice day?
- Yeah. Come on!

07:16.934 --> 07:22.226
l was your age once - in the '60s when all
you needed to finish school was a Frisbee.

07:22.439 --> 07:24.516
A gas mask helped!

07:24.734 --> 07:29.112
- See ya later, Bob.
- Protest songs, white rabbits.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.817
TNT didn't hurt anything.
''Take tea and see''.

07:43.128 --> 07:45.120
Free love!

07:45.755 --> 07:49.884
Cosmo says that today is the day,
so get rid of 'em.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.336
Hey, Crystal. How you doin'?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.176
Michael, l can't keep this mink wheel.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.598
What? Why not?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.563
We must seek different destinies, Michael.

08:00.771 --> 08:03.690
Our song is over, finis. Comprendez?

08:03.901 --> 08:08.313
No, wait a second.
Talk English, will you, Crystal?

08:08.529 --> 08:12.194
You're more interested
in your stupid GTO than me.

08:12.407 --> 08:17.485
Wait. Whose name is on my fender? Yours!
Don't we go out all the time? Don't we?

08:17.707 --> 08:21.158
- To car shows, drag racing, junkyards.
- So what?

08:21.376 --> 08:26.501
- That's not what l want.
- So what do you want, Crystal? Him?

08:26.716 --> 08:32.504
Michael, l want to be swept off my feet,
seranaded, worshipped like a goddess.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.131
Come on! Bullshit!

08:35.350 --> 08:40.854
That is exactly what my ''Cosmo''
romantiscope said you'd say, Michael.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.357
Ta-ta for ever, monkey wrench!

08:48.571 --> 08:50.979
Romantiscope?!

08:52.574 --> 08:58.080
Ellie, l know it's short notice but l was
wondering if you wanted to go to the prom?

08:58.290 --> 09:01.041
Look, Sherman, can we talk about it later?

09:01.252 --> 09:05.462
Gotcha! Finally! Now l need
some information from you, OK?

09:05.673 --> 09:10.217
- Pull the plug will you?
- lt's for the yearbook. l need stats now!

09:10.428 --> 09:13.382
- You got lousy timing.
- l know.

09:13.599 --> 09:17.546
lt's a flaw in my character.
Now, what's your sign, Harlan?

09:17.767 --> 09:19.596
Pontiac.

09:20.354 --> 09:23.308
''Bimbo leaves Harlan in limbo!''

09:25.068 --> 09:28.851
Makes a great yearbook headline,
don't you think?

09:31.574 --> 09:33.982
Newsflash update.

09:34.201 --> 09:37.904
- l dumped Crystal.
- That is not what l heard.

09:38.122 --> 09:40.578
- No?
- No!

09:43.462 --> 09:46.381
OK. What do you want to know?

09:46.590 --> 09:48.630
- Your major?
- Yeah.

09:48.842 --> 09:53.304
Major? l don't know. Auto shop.

09:53.515 --> 09:57.762
- Favourite video game?
- ''World Series''.

09:57.977 --> 10:00.929
All right, how many times
did you see ''Jedi''?

10:01.147 --> 10:04.682
- l never saw ''Jedi''.
- You never saw ''Jedi''?

10:04.901 --> 10:07.902
Have you been under a car for ten years?

10:08.113 --> 10:12.610
- All right, what do you like?
- What do l like? l like cars.

10:12.824 --> 10:17.535
l like Springsteen.
l like...l like my goat, you know.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.455
- Goat?
- Yeah.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.585
- OK, yeah, but...?
- But what?

10:22.794 --> 10:25.119
What do you do in your spare time?

10:25.340 --> 10:27.581
Cars. Bye.

10:29.468 --> 10:31.425
What goat?!

10:33.221 --> 10:35.261
l want you!

10:35.473 --> 10:41.892
Mike! So what's the dish, cousin fish?
What happened? Talk to me.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.941
- What? With who?
- With Crystal.

10:45.151 --> 10:47.820
Everybody know about this but me?

10:48.029 --> 10:52.192
ln ''Dynasty'', this guy got a girl back
with a Chihuahua fur coat!

10:52.409 --> 10:56.537
Vince! She doesn't want a fur coat.
She doesn't even want me.

10:56.746 --> 11:02.667
- Yeah? What does she want?
- l don't know. She wants to be...romanced.

11:02.878 --> 11:07.505
- Swept off her feet.
- l'd sweep her off her feet with a left!

11:07.717 --> 11:12.095
- A girl pulls that back in Brooklyn. Bam!
- OK, Vince.

11:13.098 --> 11:16.466
Hey. You're cool, right?
You're cool?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.601
Yeah.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.769
l'm cool.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.058
l don't know, Vince.

11:25.276 --> 11:29.108
- Crystal.
- Why can't women be like cars?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.813
You put gas in a car and you cruise.

11:32.866 --> 11:36.734
Try and treat that girl nice
and she leaves me in the dust.

11:38.040 --> 11:43.579
You know, my old man says
treat broads like dirt and they love ya.

11:43.795 --> 11:46.466
Yeah? What's your old lady say?

11:46.675 --> 11:52.546
My parents are divorced. That's how come
l'm living in the sticks with the old man.

11:52.764 --> 11:58.054
- What did Sawyer want?
- l don't know. Yearbook stats.

11:58.269 --> 12:00.842
- l hit on Sawyer once.
- Yeah?

12:01.064 --> 12:03.935
l tried to give her this ltalian macho bod!

12:04.149 --> 12:07.271
- What did she do?
- Poor girl lost out!

12:07.487 --> 12:12.398
Called me a word l had to look up
in the dictionary. Psych majors are trouble.

12:12.616 --> 12:16.615
- l'm serious!
- Check this out. l put in new lifters.

12:16.829 --> 12:19.665
- Blow Matuski away!
- Matuski's a fag!

12:20.501 --> 12:22.707
Yeah, man! Let's roll!

12:27.257 --> 12:30.876
Come on, Sawyer! Move that thing away!

12:31.095 --> 12:33.765
Come on! Get it out of there!

12:46.152 --> 12:51.740
- What's going on, Sawyer?
- lf l knew that, Harlan, l'd fix it!

12:55.328 --> 12:59.540
OK! Come on,
you're holding everybody up. Get in the car.

13:01.752 --> 13:03.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:09.217 --> 13:11.257
Motorhead Mike!

13:11.469 --> 13:13.511
Show-off!

13:19.352 --> 13:21.475
l don't believe this.

13:35.243 --> 13:38.246
OK, Sawyer. What's going on?

13:39.874 --> 13:44.453
Distributor caps don't just pop off
unless you want 'em to.

13:44.671 --> 13:46.497
OK.

13:47.466 --> 13:49.707
lt's confession time.

13:51.262 --> 13:55.554
l need you to save me
from being voted Senior Class Spinster.

13:55.766 --> 13:57.639
What?

14:02.022 --> 14:04.561
Be a boy scout and give me a date.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.282
Sawyer!

14:13.494 --> 14:15.449
Too much!

14:23.962 --> 14:25.790
OK.

14:26.005 --> 14:29.505
OK, Sawyer. l'll pick you up at eight.
Be outside.

14:29.718 --> 14:35.092
- Outside? Won't you meet my parents?
- Yeah. Outside. No way.

14:36.226 --> 14:38.846
You're better with cars than with people.

14:39.061 --> 14:42.060
Look, if you don't want to do this, it's fine...

14:42.315 --> 14:46.014
No, Harlan. Really.
l'll be outside at eight. Fine.

14:46.235 --> 14:48.192
OK.

14:52.325 --> 14:56.193
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
Do you read that mag ''Cosmo''?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.618
That rag? Are you kidding?

15:00.416 --> 15:02.244
Good.

15:05.966 --> 15:08.834
- Harlan?
- What?

15:09.051 --> 15:11.969
The name's Ellie not Sawyer, OK?

15:12.554 --> 15:14.797
Right. Ellie.

15:17.894 --> 15:21.012
Hey, let's move it or we'll move it for ya!

15:21.230 --> 15:25.690
- Let's go, Sherm the worm!
- Move the heap, gonad.

15:25.902 --> 15:27.941
Get it outta the way!

15:52.220 --> 15:54.926
Here you are. A bit more!

15:55.139 --> 15:58.057
lt's so good!

16:04.734 --> 16:07.270
Mikey! Mike!

16:07.486 --> 16:09.524
This is my kid here.

16:09.739 --> 16:13.572
- Hi.
- l didn't expect you home so early.

16:14.118 --> 16:16.157
l...l got take-out here.

16:16.372 --> 16:19.372
Why don't you grab yourself a table?

16:19.581 --> 16:21.623
Oh, no, no. That's OK.

16:25.964 --> 16:28.502
Oh, Mike, l'd like you meet Delores.

16:28.759 --> 16:31.546
She's the sales representative for...

16:33.013 --> 16:35.885
- Betty-Jo.
- Betty-Jo Cosmetics.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.969
- How do you do, Michael?
- Hi.

16:39.186 --> 16:42.188
l'm so pleased to make your acquaintance.

16:44.732 --> 16:49.811
l gotta get going. l've got a date.
l'll just...l'll just take a beer.

16:50.032 --> 16:52.653
Nice meeting you, Louise.

16:52.865 --> 16:55.108
Come on, Skipper.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.701
Ciao, Michael.

16:58.455 --> 17:00.581
Louise?

17:14.390 --> 17:18.387
- You're really out to impress me, Harlan!
- What?

17:18.603 --> 17:22.766
- Breaking and entering on a first date!
- Come on!

17:22.981 --> 17:25.733
l can't believe this.

17:25.943 --> 17:29.857
l must have a masochistic tendency
l didn't know about.

17:30.073 --> 17:33.607
Doesn't anybody
wine and dine a girl any more?

17:33.827 --> 17:35.865
Come on!

17:37.330 --> 17:39.868
Keep it down, will you? Get down!

17:43.002 --> 17:45.872
Oh, come on, Harlan. Wait up! Harlan!

17:56.851 --> 18:02.855
This may be a stupid question,
but what are we doing in a junkyard?

18:03.065 --> 18:07.644
- This isn't just any junkyard.
- What's special about it?

18:07.861 --> 18:10.897
lt used to be an old military testing ground.

18:11.573 --> 18:17.113
Now they just dump all their old junk here.
l thought you'd like it.

18:17.330 --> 18:21.541
- You want to be a reporter, don't you?
- Yeah. Or a psych.

18:21.751 --> 18:25.369
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Look around.

18:26.548 --> 18:29.419
Everything here's got a story behind it.

18:32.346 --> 18:37.636
Yeah. You know, you're right.
l never really thought about it.

18:40.688 --> 18:42.479
Harlan!

18:45.942 --> 18:48.814
What are we doing here?

18:50.031 --> 18:52.901
l need a project to graduate.

18:53.909 --> 18:56.660
l can't do anything scientific.

18:56.872 --> 19:00.370
What l can do is...is restore old machines.

19:01.335 --> 19:05.284
l might find something to pass off
as my science project.

19:07.423 --> 19:10.176
Michael! Are you OK?

19:10.384 --> 19:13.255
Yeah. Just get that light out of my eyes.

19:13.472 --> 19:14.966
Sorry.

19:43.962 --> 19:48.920
- What is it down there?
- l don't know. A fallout shelter or something.

20:11.865 --> 20:15.449
''You can protect yourself
from radioactive fallout.''

20:21.083 --> 20:25.461
- Michael, what is it?
- Nothing. Please keep your voice down.

20:26.339 --> 20:28.461
OK.

20:50.865 --> 20:52.822
Michael, where are you?

20:58.913 --> 21:03.079
Michael, it's really spooky up here.
Please come back.

21:04.003 --> 21:06.411
Yeah. Just a second.

21:28.445 --> 21:30.902
''Property of US Government''.

21:36.038 --> 21:39.618
Michael, l think l heard something.

21:43.711 --> 21:47.922
''To be opened by authorized personnel

21:48.132 --> 21:51.383
''only under controlled conditions''.

22:43.564 --> 22:47.147
- Ellie, toss me that big light.
- OK.

22:49.279 --> 22:50.772
Thanks.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.325
What...?

23:13.304 --> 23:16.590
Michael, please come out so l can see you.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.559
Hey, Ellie?

23:26.526 --> 23:29.481
OK, that's it, Harlan.

23:29.697 --> 23:32.269
This is the end of the line for me.

23:32.492 --> 23:36.439
What are you doing up there?
We've gotta get outta here.

23:36.662 --> 23:40.326
- On that ratty ground?
- There are worse things than rats.

23:40.541 --> 23:44.870
- Yeah? Such as what?
- You kids! Hold it right there!

23:45.087 --> 23:47.495
- Jail. Come on!
- Oh, God!

23:53.847 --> 23:56.172
This is Federal property!

23:58.602 --> 24:04.106
Just great! l'm gonna get arrested and end
up in some woman's prison somewhere.

24:04.315 --> 24:07.186
Will you stop talking and run?!

24:10.572 --> 24:13.658
- So, you come here often?
- Come on!

24:16.620 --> 24:18.992
Come on, girl. Let's get 'em.

24:20.457 --> 24:24.124
So what do you do for fun?

24:24.336 --> 24:26.376
Hurry up.

24:26.588 --> 24:29.424
Stop, you two! Freeze!

24:30.634 --> 24:32.379
Hold it!

24:40.938 --> 24:43.808
- Well, a night to remember.
- Look, l...

24:46.067 --> 24:47.810
What was that?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.449
l don't get it.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.123
What did you do?

25:03.335 --> 25:07.465
Nothing. lt just died. Doesn't make sense.
l just tuned this thing.

25:07.675 --> 25:12.216
- What's going on?
- Don't ask me. You're the car nut.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.890
- What's going on?
- l don't know.

25:32.033 --> 25:33.406
Damn!

25:37.412 --> 25:40.200
Lucky we're close to town.

25:40.416 --> 25:44.081
- Yeah? How's that lucky?
- We can walk.

25:45.003 --> 25:47.921
- Not me.
- What are you talking about?

25:48.131 --> 25:51.216
- l'm stayin' here.
- Staying here? Why?

25:52.387 --> 25:55.305
First, l'd never leave my goat here, all right?

25:55.515 --> 26:00.558
Secondly, if l walked into town
the whole world would know l broke down.

26:00.770 --> 26:04.473
- Come on! lt happens to everybody.
- Not to me.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.477
Then why are we standing here?

26:22.168 --> 26:24.574
- Oh, thanks.
- Are you OK?

26:24.796 --> 26:28.081
l got a little car problem.
Can l use your radio?

26:28.342 --> 26:30.166
Sure.

26:31.053 --> 26:33.210
- Can l get channel 18?
- Yeah.

26:35.431 --> 26:41.018
- Slower...
- BrookIyn Boy! Do you read me?

26:43.815 --> 26:45.937
Rene...

26:46.153 --> 26:48.856
BrookIyn Boy, read me?

26:49.070 --> 26:51.822
Whoa! Come on.

26:52.699 --> 26:55.985
Wait a minute. Wait. Oh, man!

26:56.204 --> 26:58.873
Mike, is that you?

26:59.081 --> 27:02.831
Yeah, it's me.
Listen, l got an SOS, OK?

27:03.043 --> 27:06.578
Five miles north of town on 73,
do you read me?

27:06.798 --> 27:10.249
- Hey, l'm comin'. Chill out.
- Hey, Vinnie!

27:10.469 --> 27:13.422
My partner needs me. We're outta here.

27:13.637 --> 27:15.963
So what am l? Kryptonite?

27:24.816 --> 27:27.937
- Do you want a sip?
- l don't like beer.

27:29.905 --> 27:31.697
Right.

27:32.908 --> 27:36.028
Sawyer and Harlan!

27:36.245 --> 27:39.161
Wait till Crystal finds out about this.

27:39.372 --> 27:41.364
Rene, zip it up!

27:44.046 --> 27:48.506
Hey, you punks! Move that piece of junk
to the side of the road.

27:48.715 --> 27:51.254
Sit on this, butt plug!

27:53.930 --> 27:56.052
Punk!

27:58.809 --> 28:00.848
All right! Yeah!

28:06.026 --> 28:08.434
OK, ease up. This is it.

28:11.531 --> 28:14.450
That's good, Vinnie.

28:25.546 --> 28:28.119
Not now. l'm not in the mood no more.

28:28.341 --> 28:32.717
- You'll be begging me later.
- lf you're lucky.

28:41.604 --> 28:46.313
Motorhead Mike broke down?
Wait till we spread that around school.

28:48.069 --> 28:50.986
l had a...really neat time tonight.

28:53.283 --> 28:56.285
Yeah. Sure you did!

28:56.493 --> 28:59.911
No, no, really. lt was...

29:03.334 --> 29:05.376
lt was a surprise.

29:09.466 --> 29:11.542
Like you, Harlan.

29:22.729 --> 29:24.972
Hey, Ellie?

29:25.401 --> 29:28.188
The name is Michael.

29:28.402 --> 29:30.312
OK?

29:31.572 --> 29:34.147
OK, Michael.

29:35.411 --> 29:38.494
- Good night.
- 'Night.

29:41.501 --> 29:44.418
- Let's go, Vinnie!
- Blasting off!

29:49.050 --> 29:51.921
l thought you had dibs on Sawyer, Sherm.

29:52.136 --> 29:55.089
Look, do we have a deal or what?

29:55.307 --> 29:59.090
Messing with Harlan and Tonto's
gonna cost ya.

30:00.437 --> 30:03.353
- How much?
- One video cassette.

30:03.564 --> 30:06.649
- Term paper.
- Science project.

30:07.818 --> 30:09.811
You got it!

30:12.573 --> 30:14.482
Let's go.

30:22.376 --> 30:24.665
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight,

30:24.879 --> 30:26.751
ninety-nine,

30:26.964 --> 30:29.122
one hundred.

30:33.429 --> 30:37.758
You ain't exactly been
the perfect date, Vinnie.

30:37.975 --> 30:41.890
- You ain't exactly been a perfect date.
- Since when?

30:42.105 --> 30:45.804
Since you still ain't turned
into a pepperoni pizza!

30:46.026 --> 30:50.734
Well, you can just drift, hum hole!
The sock ain't foolin' anyone!

30:51.406 --> 30:57.112
Poor girl. You know, l've seen this movie
where this haunted car flames guys out.

30:57.327 --> 31:01.659
Yeah! Wonder what the hell
shorted out the electrical system.

31:03.085 --> 31:07.877
- This starter's totally shot!
- l swear somebody's got it in for you, Mikey.

31:08.089 --> 31:11.873
- lt pisses me off.
- l remember this ''Mannix''.

31:12.095 --> 31:17.005
These dudes are after another dude
so they put dynamite in the first dude's car.

31:17.225 --> 31:20.807
- When he turns the ignition...
- He gets flamed, right?

31:21.021 --> 31:24.390
- You seen it too?
- Oh, Vinnie!

31:25.316 --> 31:27.808
What's this piece of junk?

31:28.027 --> 31:31.729
l don't know.
l found that at old Dawson Field.

31:31.948 --> 31:34.866
Figured l'd pass it off as my science project.

31:35.077 --> 31:37.865
Well, good luck. You'll need it.

31:38.373 --> 31:40.909
Yeah. Thanks for helping me out, Vinnie.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.829
No sweat. See ya at the brain fest tomorrow.

31:44.043 --> 31:46.751
- OK. Take it easy.
- Yeah, 'night.

31:46.964 --> 31:48.922
Good night.

32:20.831 --> 32:23.583
Somebody's definitely got it in for you, Mikey.

32:23.794 --> 32:29.037
- Yeah? Like who?
- Some low-octane type. Crystal, maybe.

32:29.257 --> 32:30.668
Right.

33:45.419 --> 33:47.460
Vinnie?

33:48.132 --> 33:50.171
Holy sh...

33:50.928 --> 33:53.548
- Look at this!
- My God!

33:53.762 --> 33:56.884
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:05.316 --> 34:09.693
- What do you think it is?
- Could be an engine.

34:09.902 --> 34:12.228
But an engine to what?

34:14.826 --> 34:17.447
l wonder what this thing runs on.

34:17.661 --> 34:19.322
Unleaded.

34:19.580 --> 34:22.583
- Maybe premium!
- Shut up, Vinnie!

34:25.170 --> 34:28.088
Holy smoke! My box! Ga...

34:29.507 --> 34:33.290
- What happened?
- l don't know. Brand-new batteries.

34:33.512 --> 34:36.630
- Yeah.
- That pisses me off.

34:36.849 --> 34:40.799
Go get that battery.
l wanna run some juice through this.

34:41.021 --> 34:43.262
All right. Move, move.

34:43.481 --> 34:46.399
- OK, hook it up.
- Why me?

34:46.610 --> 34:51.768
lf it blows up in your face you've got
nothin' to lose. OK, move outta the way.

34:51.991 --> 34:54.741
Where shall l put this?

34:54.952 --> 34:57.407
l don't know. Be careful.

34:58.329 --> 35:00.370
Shit!

35:00.582 --> 35:06.004
- Put that thing out! lt'll blow up.
- l'm getting outta here.

35:06.212 --> 35:08.254
Holy smoke!

35:09.507 --> 35:12.258
What's it doing? Vince!

35:15.348 --> 35:17.720
What was that noise?

35:18.975 --> 35:22.843
- Look, look, look.
- Yeah! Disconnect it!

35:23.064 --> 35:25.769
You disconnect it. l'll watch.

35:29.237 --> 35:31.276
What's it doing?

35:32.281 --> 35:33.941
Vince?

35:34.159 --> 35:35.902
Weird!

35:45.754 --> 35:48.292
We're hallucinating, right?

35:49.757 --> 35:54.919
No ''Outer Limits'' l ever seen had
this stuff before. What do we do?

35:56.141 --> 35:58.678
We disconnect it. Come on.

35:58.893 --> 36:01.680
You disconnect it. l'll watch.

36:01.896 --> 36:04.600
- Go ahead. l'll stand guard.
- Yeah.

36:10.821 --> 36:12.899
OK.

36:22.999 --> 36:27.047
Mike, remember the show
in which the Egyptian vase just...

36:27.256 --> 36:29.379
Give it a rest. OK, Vince?

36:29.593 --> 36:31.963
Yeah, sure. l'm cool. Yeah.

36:32.177 --> 36:36.341
- Yeah, we're working on the car.
- l don't work on the car.

36:36.557 --> 36:39.475
- Should we tell sombody...?
- No. Not yet.

36:41.853 --> 36:44.345
The science final! Grab that thing!

36:45.189 --> 36:47.433
Just grab it! Come on!

36:50.529 --> 36:52.984
Put that on there.

36:53.198 --> 36:56.069
- That's good.
- OK. Come on.

37:00.499 --> 37:02.574
That's weird.

37:05.252 --> 37:08.621
Wait a second. lt's gotta be wrong.

37:08.841 --> 37:12.838
So how come everybody's leaving
like school's over?

37:13.052 --> 37:15.544
- l don't know.
- Stay tuned.

37:15.764 --> 37:19.050
- We went two hours into the future.
- What?

37:25.817 --> 37:30.276
Sherm! How's life in the fat lane?

37:30.487 --> 37:34.271
Vince Latello, comedian.
You guys lost or something?

37:34.493 --> 37:38.191
We're not lost, Sherman.
We came for...a book.

37:38.413 --> 37:41.747
- A car book?
- No, not a car book.

37:41.959 --> 37:46.003
A book about...strange things.

37:46.212 --> 37:49.629
- Like Vince?
- Sayonara, big nose. Hold me back.

37:49.841 --> 37:54.967
Take it easy. Look, Sherman,
we just want this book. Help us out, OK?

37:55.181 --> 37:57.220
- OK.
- OK.

37:57.892 --> 38:00.346
What kind of strange things?

38:00.561 --> 38:03.562
Well...sort of like stuff...

38:04.981 --> 38:10.355
Stuff vanishes then stuff comes in from other
times, but you can't touch the stuff.

38:10.571 --> 38:16.075
- 'Cause it kinda disappeared.
- Like you if you flap your fish lips again!

38:16.287 --> 38:21.162
- That sounds like magic which is section...
- No, magic's make-believe.

38:21.374 --> 38:25.418
Yeah, we're talking about
the flip side of reality.

38:25.628 --> 38:28.499
Well, this is the science section.

38:28.717 --> 38:31.253
lt's about as real as you can get.

38:31.469 --> 38:33.674
What's the title?

38:33.887 --> 38:35.464
What?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.258
Author.

38:37.474 --> 38:41.009
- l don't know.
- Well, what's it about?

38:41.228 --> 38:44.230
Monsters, flying lawn-mowers, weird shit!

38:44.440 --> 38:47.440
No, no. lt's about these two guys, right?

38:47.650 --> 38:52.692
They go into this room and these things
come in and out of the walls.

38:52.907 --> 38:56.988
- Sounds weird all right.
- See, these guys leave this room.

38:57.203 --> 39:02.495
- lt's two hours into the future.
- Only it felt like ten minutes to the two guys.

39:03.918 --> 39:07.702
That sounds like
we're dealing with a time-space warp.

39:07.922 --> 39:12.252
- A time-space what?
- Warp. A time-space warp.

39:13.512 --> 39:15.884
- How does it work?
- Simple.

39:16.098 --> 39:22.101
lt's kinda like breaking through the barriers
between time, space and all dimensions.

39:22.313 --> 39:24.769
You mean outer space?

39:26.274 --> 39:28.397
Yeah. Right.

39:29.069 --> 39:32.272
- So, they're all connected?
- Precisely.

39:32.489 --> 39:37.567
They coexist within the same space
on different planes of reality, that's all.

39:37.786 --> 39:42.699
So, like, something could warp in
from one dimension to another?

39:42.917 --> 39:47.545
- Sure, but only if the warp got outta control.
- Outta control how?

39:47.756 --> 39:52.334
Einstein theorised it would take great power
to break through a barrier.

39:52.552 --> 39:57.678
The danger is, once you unleash the power,
you'd lose control of it.

39:57.891 --> 40:02.222
- Yeah, and then what?
- Earth's energy field would go crazy.

40:02.437 --> 40:06.850
A chain reaction could start.
Weather could change.

40:07.067 --> 40:10.103
And boom! You're all cosmic dust!

40:14.241 --> 40:17.325
- Hey, Mike. Banks!
- What?

40:17.537 --> 40:22.910
We point the gizmo at the greenery. Bammo!
lt vanishes into our car. We make a fortune!

40:23.126 --> 40:25.367
Your pilot light is out.

40:25.588 --> 40:29.799
- Well, what do we do with it?
- lt's my science project, remember?

40:30.009 --> 40:33.757
Turn it in, get my diploma
and kiss this school goodbye.

40:33.969 --> 40:37.306
- You're pullin' my zucchini.
- You got a better suggestion?

40:37.516 --> 40:40.434
Yeah. l say we sell it to ''60 Minutes''.

40:40.645 --> 40:42.104
''60 Minutes''?

40:45.066 --> 40:48.233
- See ya.
- There he is. Bob!

40:48.443 --> 40:52.857
- Listen, about the...
- You cut my science final. Where were you?

40:53.074 --> 40:55.825
- ln the auto shop.
- ln the ozone.

40:56.035 --> 40:59.653
ln the ozone, blow zone!
l'm tired of you four Fs.

40:59.873 --> 41:05.707
l'll tell you one thing, unless your project
is dyno-supreme, you both get Ds.

41:05.921 --> 41:10.297
- Hey, l'll take it.
- l wanted to talk about my science project.

41:10.508 --> 41:13.628
Maybe you'd come by and take a look at it.

41:13.846 --> 41:18.553
l'm off to an anti-war alumni meeting
and l'm late. Can you dig it?

41:18.767 --> 41:22.932
- You're the only one who'd understand this.
- Don't bet on it.

41:23.145 --> 41:25.555
- Give us a break.
- All right.

41:25.775 --> 41:29.440
- l'll be here grading papers at nine o'clock.
- Nine o'clock?

41:29.653 --> 41:32.144
What are we fighting for?

41:32.365 --> 41:35.864
Don't ask me I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam

41:36.077 --> 41:38.865
So how come you didn't tell him?

41:39.081 --> 41:44.620
- We got a door to the ''Twilight Zone''?
- You're gonna blow his doors off with this!

41:44.835 --> 41:49.998
- Yeah. You got any change, Vinnie?
- School tax, jellyfish. Come on.

41:50.217 --> 41:52.542
Here. Drift!

41:52.761 --> 41:55.086
He had to take a leak.

42:11.572 --> 42:14.359
- Hello.
- Hey, EIIie, It's me, MichaeI,

42:14.576 --> 42:18.490
- Hi, Michael.
- WouId you Iike to go out tonight?

42:18.704 --> 42:22.371
- Sure. l'd like to.
- CouId you bring your camera?

42:22.583 --> 42:24.872
- My camera?
- To take pictures,

42:25.087 --> 42:27.958
We're not going to a junkyard, are we?

42:39.017 --> 42:41.056
To a great life.

42:43.439 --> 42:46.060
You're all mine.

42:46.275 --> 42:49.193
You're all mine.

43:01.207 --> 43:04.871
- What the hell happened here?
- Oh, Mike!

43:05.086 --> 43:08.918
How do you like the colour scheme?
Delores did it.

43:09.132 --> 43:11.458
You remember Delores?

43:11.677 --> 43:13.716
Hello, Michael.

43:13.928 --> 43:16.763
lt's so lovely to see you again.

43:18.059 --> 43:20.631
Lovely. Lovely.

43:21.895 --> 43:24.268
l hardly recognise the place.

43:33.116 --> 43:38.406
l know we shouldn't have gone off to Reno
to get married like lovesick puppies!

43:38.620 --> 43:42.156
Don't worry, sugarplum.
l'll have a talk with him.

43:47.088 --> 43:50.921
You are going to socialise
with your new stepmother.

43:51.134 --> 43:53.506
Do l make myself clear?

43:58.849 --> 44:00.843
Stepmother?!

44:13.825 --> 44:16.031
Quiet, Skipper.

44:24.795 --> 44:26.703
Eyes right!

44:35.848 --> 44:37.758
Burn it!

44:39.268 --> 44:41.722
Any time, Vinnie.

44:41.937 --> 44:43.811
Vinnie?

44:45.815 --> 44:47.939
Open sesame!

44:51.531 --> 44:53.606
Watch out, watch out.

44:56.452 --> 44:59.288
What is this? Night school?

44:59.496 --> 45:03.827
- Something's going on around here.
- What did they rip off in the auto shop?

45:07.714 --> 45:11.792
''Who's the father of the H-bomb?
Boy George.''

45:14.136 --> 45:17.091
That's nuclear power for ya.

45:19.601 --> 45:23.386
- Sorry we're late.
- l'd given up on you guys.

45:23.605 --> 45:26.392
l really appreciate this. Here it is.

45:29.110 --> 45:33.025
What is it? Put it on the table.
l'll get a look at it.

45:33.241 --> 45:35.483
You don't know what it is?

45:35.700 --> 45:38.487
l'm just testing you guys!

45:38.745 --> 45:40.573
Yeah.

45:40.790 --> 45:45.536
OK. Now, watch this.
Press these two things, right?

45:46.505 --> 45:48.496
See those lights?

45:48.714 --> 45:50.457
Weird!

45:50.675 --> 45:54.258
- Yeah.
- Listen when l pull these levers out.

45:57.558 --> 45:58.886
And back.

46:01.894 --> 46:04.518
Pretty amazing, huh, Bob?

46:04.731 --> 46:08.681
- lt's incredible, huh?
- Psychedelic!

46:08.903 --> 46:11.109
- Go on. Touch it.
- Yeah?

46:11.321 --> 46:13.112
Go ahead.

46:18.496 --> 46:22.790
What we should do first
is find out what metal this is.

46:22.998 --> 46:27.080
Here we go.
Have you seen my neo-spector?

46:28.299 --> 46:30.919
Let's just...

46:35.138 --> 46:38.055
lt's unreal. l mean...

46:38.267 --> 46:42.099
lt doesn't... lt doesn't show up
on our metal spector.

46:44.188 --> 46:48.816
l mean, it's some sort of...
lt's some sort of power plant.

46:49.028 --> 46:51.518
Hear that, Mike? lt's an engine!

46:51.739 --> 46:56.033
- An engine for what?
- Wait, where did you guys dig this up?

46:56.243 --> 47:00.454
- Michael found it at the...
- No. l found it at the...

47:00.665 --> 47:04.282
at the old junk yard outside of town,
Sam's place.

47:04.503 --> 47:07.123
l'd like to know whose it was.

47:07.338 --> 47:11.206
This is generating
power and light without heat, Michael.

47:11.424 --> 47:14.593
- How is that possible?
- lt's not possible.

47:15.681 --> 47:18.432
l mean, not on this world, anyway.

47:18.642 --> 47:21.311
Whoa! What world are we talking about?

47:21.519 --> 47:24.306
- lt's broken.
- Vinnie, get that battery.

47:24.523 --> 47:27.012
Wait. Bob, why would that be broken?

47:27.234 --> 47:32.109
Because if it isn't broken, Michael,
this is older than Earth. All right?

47:32.322 --> 47:36.105
Bob, wait until you see this.
Hook it up, Vinnie.

47:36.327 --> 47:39.613
- No. You hook it up.
- l did it last time..

47:39.829 --> 47:42.951
- l'm not going near this thing.
- Vinnie, please...

47:43.166 --> 47:45.539
Wait! l'll hook it up.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.421
OK, Bob.

47:52.427 --> 47:55.215
lt goes on these things.

47:55.638 --> 47:57.465
All right.

48:12.489 --> 48:15.241
- Look at that.
- Wow!

48:15.449 --> 48:19.780
l seen lights like this
at a Ozzy Osbourne concert.

48:20.039 --> 48:24.083
Can you imagine the advanced
alien civilisation that created this?

48:24.294 --> 48:28.836
l mean, this is...
This is bigger than all of us.

48:29.841 --> 48:32.711
This is... This is bigger.

48:33.470 --> 48:37.301
Bigger than any of us.
This is bigger than the planet.

48:38.264 --> 48:40.010
lt's...

48:40.226 --> 48:42.895
lt's even bigger than the solar system.

48:43.104 --> 48:47.268
Bob, is this like when you said
we could smoke banana peel?

48:47.900 --> 48:50.652
Oh, ye of little faith!

48:50.864 --> 48:54.362
- What is it, Bob?
- l'll tell you what it is.

48:54.575 --> 48:58.489
lt's a time-space warp
that's created by this gizmo

48:58.704 --> 49:02.121
and we can travel through time and space.

49:02.333 --> 49:05.002
Yeah? Let's call ''People'' magazine.

49:05.210 --> 49:07.962
No. l vote we tell the police.

49:08.172 --> 49:11.754
The pigs? No pigs! No. No!

49:11.968 --> 49:14.590
- Unhook it, Vince.
- No!

49:14.805 --> 49:17.378
Don't you touch that, Vince.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.809
lt's an implosion meltdown.

49:25.022 --> 49:27.430
Whoa. lt slimed out the battery.

49:28.904 --> 49:33.196
- What shall we do, Bob?
- l'll show you what we'll do.

49:52.135 --> 49:54.672
Who hit the lights? What's going on?

49:54.888 --> 50:00.558
Forget it. Let's do it anyway. Come on.
All right! Let's do it! Let's go!

50:04.313 --> 50:07.018
- Mr Roberts!
- What's going on?

50:07.234 --> 50:12.608
The dimension barriers.
They're breaking away. lt is! lt is a gateway.

50:12.823 --> 50:17.781
- Disconnect it, Vinnie.
- No, Mike. You disconnect it!

50:17.993 --> 50:24.199
You don't know what you're looking at.
You don't know what you see. lt's pure time.

50:24.419 --> 50:27.502
Pure space...

50:27.714 --> 50:31.794
- Michael, don't listen. Stop this!
- Stop it!

50:32.010 --> 50:34.417
l'm at the headquarters of creation.

50:34.636 --> 50:38.551
l feel the whole universe in my fingertips.

50:38.767 --> 50:42.100
- Mr Roberts!
- No! Bobby!

50:42.313 --> 50:47.141
l feel... l feel...
the Earth, infinity, what a rush!

50:47.359 --> 50:50.479
- No!
- What a ride!

51:00.123 --> 51:03.038
Oh, God!

51:03.751 --> 51:06.243
What happened to him?

51:13.761 --> 51:16.597
A souvenir!

51:16.807 --> 51:19.678
lt's Christmas time!

51:19.893 --> 51:21.552
Look at that!

51:21.769 --> 51:27.013
lt's like ''The Blob''. The more power,
the stronger it gets. What's goin' on?

51:29.612 --> 51:31.568
All right! Do it!

51:31.781 --> 51:35.114
- Hey!
- lt's Harlan. Let's run!

51:35.324 --> 51:38.279
Mikey, the warp. We gotta stop the warp.

51:38.496 --> 51:39.871
Yeah.

51:40.706 --> 51:42.995
Michael, is Bob dead?

51:43.208 --> 51:47.503
- l don't know.
- Great! There goes my D.

51:47.713 --> 51:50.288
What are we gonna do?

51:50.508 --> 51:53.343
- We'll stop it ourselves.
- What?

51:53.553 --> 51:58.213
lf we break the connection,
the gizmo can't reach the power station.

51:58.433 --> 52:02.266
- Nobody'll know anything.
- So what's the plan?

52:02.479 --> 52:04.603
We black out town.

52:04.814 --> 52:07.270
Black out town!

52:08.443 --> 52:11.563
- But how?
- Blow up the power lines.

52:11.780 --> 52:14.863
De-mo-lition!

52:33.679 --> 52:36.466
Keep it down. The old man's upstairs.

52:36.681 --> 52:41.639
- Michael, isn't this a bit dangerous?
- Think of the fun!

52:41.853 --> 52:45.103
- Come on, Vinnie.
- Vinnie!

52:54.783 --> 52:57.619
Vinnie! Come on! Come on!

53:09.006 --> 53:11.842
- Mikey, dust it off!
- l'm movin'.

53:12.052 --> 53:14.589
Michael, it's coming! Hurry!

53:20.227 --> 53:22.349
Come on! Dynamite!

53:22.563 --> 53:25.598
- Dynamite!
- You know what you're doin'?

53:25.857 --> 53:29.522
Sure! We do it all the time
in Brooklyn!

53:32.031 --> 53:36.074
Mikey, l thought you had
more under the hood than this!

53:45.043 --> 53:47.535
Go, baby! Go! Go!

53:51.384 --> 53:53.875
Come on, baby. Come on!

53:54.094 --> 53:56.930
- Hit the blower.
- OK. Hold on!

54:04.147 --> 54:07.600
Whoa! Now we are talking hyperspace!

54:09.861 --> 54:12.897
Michael, this is too fast for me.

54:13.114 --> 54:15.820
Don't worry. lt's like a ride in Disneyland.

54:16.034 --> 54:18.242
Hold on!

54:24.878 --> 54:28.293
- Mikey, we've done it!
- We did it!

54:28.505 --> 54:30.213
Brake!

54:37.599 --> 54:39.924
Now, that was a ride!

54:42.645 --> 54:44.970
OK. This is it. Let's go.

54:45.188 --> 54:49.318
l kinda feel like Gregory Peck
in ''The Guns Of Navarone''.

54:49.528 --> 54:52.695
- Latello!
- All right! Hold your horses here!

54:58.203 --> 55:01.121
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.

55:01.331 --> 55:04.285
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.

55:04.501 --> 55:07.370
- Vince?
- Caps to the legs. Legs to the dynamite.

55:07.587 --> 55:11.717
- Come on!
- Good thing l watch TV, huh?

55:11.925 --> 55:14.843
- Come on! Ellie, hurry up.
- OK.

55:15.055 --> 55:17.378
l'm gettin' outta here!

55:17.598 --> 55:18.974
Here!

55:19.182 --> 55:21.806
- Hook it up.
- You hook it up.

55:22.019 --> 55:24.771
- Latello, come on!
- OK. Chill out!

55:27.983 --> 55:30.522
Legs! Legs!

55:34.657 --> 55:40.281
- Please, Michael! Do it!
- OK. Get down. Come on! Ready?

55:49.129 --> 55:51.916
- My car battery.
- Car battery!

55:54.386 --> 55:56.712
Open! Come on! Open!

55:59.850 --> 56:02.638
- Get back!
- Get down!

56:40.892 --> 56:42.850
We did it!

56:44.355 --> 56:46.680
Come on. Let's go.

56:57.575 --> 57:02.156
How do we get the gizmo
outta school past the fuzzballs?

57:02.375 --> 57:04.082
Damn!

57:04.292 --> 57:05.951
Police!

57:06.170 --> 57:08.458
Those maggots!

57:08.673 --> 57:10.712
Come on!

57:17.847 --> 57:21.847
- Don't you think we should tell the police?
-Tell them what?

57:22.062 --> 57:26.854
- We sent our science teacher into a warp.
- What are we gonna do?

57:27.068 --> 57:30.352
- One to five with good behaviour.
- Vinnie!

57:30.570 --> 57:33.321
- This is me!
- Yeah, OK.

57:33.531 --> 57:36.901
So! You're cool! l'm cool! We're cool!

57:37.118 --> 57:39.158
Thank you. Good night.

57:39.369 --> 57:41.281
Good night.

57:47.921 --> 57:50.330
Do you copy?

57:55.887 --> 57:59.258
,,across the county tonight,

57:59.475 --> 58:04.053
and the deIiberate dynamiting
of power Iines by unknown individuaIs,

58:04.272 --> 58:10.060
PoIice hope to have more to report soon,
This concIudes our speciaI buIIetin,

58:10.279 --> 58:12.485
You know, l...

58:13.447 --> 58:16.022
..l can't stop thinking about Bob.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.326
Neither can l.

58:20.914 --> 58:23.157
l'm really scared, Michael.

58:24.084 --> 58:27.169
l mean, what is this thing?

58:31.636 --> 58:33.673
l don't know.

58:34.387 --> 58:38.764
Whatever it is, wherever it's from,
it's over with now, OK?

58:38.973 --> 58:42.972
- We stopped it, so don't worry about it.
- OK.

58:49.067 --> 58:52.982
My parents are gonna have
a hormonal disturbance!

58:54.032 --> 58:56.320
l've gotta go.

58:56.535 --> 58:58.194
Good night.

59:02.331 --> 59:03.827
Ellie?

59:04.878 --> 59:06.370
Ellie?

59:10.173 --> 59:12.047
l was...

59:14.303 --> 59:16.343
l was just thinkin'.

59:18.767 --> 59:25.134
How come we spent four years in the same
class and never even talked to each other?

59:27.277 --> 59:29.351
l don't know.

59:29.567 --> 59:32.107
Maybe because...

59:32.320 --> 59:36.401
you lived under cars and...l lived in books.

59:38.954 --> 59:40.862
Yeah.

59:41.957 --> 59:43.950
Good night.

59:45.751 --> 59:47.663
Good night.

59:50.173 --> 59:51.917
Good night.

59:54.887 --> 59:57.044
You're right, you know.

59:58.390 --> 01:00:00.598
About what?

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:05.436
Just about...me being better with cars
than with people.

01:00:09.776 --> 01:00:14.154
l guess it's 'cause l trust them
more than l do people.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:19.367
Maybe you've just been trusting
the wrong people, Michael.

01:00:20.497 --> 01:00:22.205
Yeah.

01:00:24.043 --> 01:00:26.082
Maybe l have been.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:37.298
My retainer.

01:00:38.098 --> 01:00:39.722
Sorry!

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:07.503
Hey, Skipper, how ya doin'?

01:01:07.713 --> 01:01:10.085
Watch it, boy!

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.726
Welcome home, kid.

01:01:22.978 --> 01:01:27.106
- Where you been?
- Who the hell are you?

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:33.188
l'm the long arm of the law,
the public conscience, Detective Jack Nulty.

01:01:33.406 --> 01:01:35.895
l didn't do nothin'.

01:01:36.117 --> 01:01:38.359
Hey, Dad. What is all this?

01:01:38.578 --> 01:01:44.450
l told Detective Nulty everything about
the break-in but he insisted on talking to you.

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:49.827
Well, hell, yeah!
l haven't had a real good case in a long time.

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:54.676
l ain't about to piss this one away.
Know what l mean, kid?

01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:58.509
Yeah. That's your job, right?

01:01:58.723 --> 01:02:03.220
- That's what l like to hear.
- l'm gonna take care of everything.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.896
You need a court order for this!
What's the charge?

01:02:07.107 --> 01:02:09.646
No charge - yet.

01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:13.353
Three eye-witnesses
put you at the school tonight.

01:02:13.573 --> 01:02:18.400
There's this little business about stolen
dynamite, and where's your pal?

01:02:18.619 --> 01:02:21.989
That ex-yippie science teacher,
Bob Roberts?

01:02:24.293 --> 01:02:27.161
- l don't know.
- That a fact?

01:02:27.379 --> 01:02:29.835
- Yeah....
- Tell you what.

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:34.591
- Let's take a ride down to the station.
- What for?

01:02:34.805 --> 01:02:38.883
- l'm enjoying the conversation.
- l'm going with you.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.101
Bring your wife, your kids, the whole family.

01:02:42.311 --> 01:02:46.440
- Can l get my jacket? ls that OK, mister?
- Fine by me.

01:02:46.648 --> 01:02:48.607
Thank you.

01:02:49.193 --> 01:02:51.185
Thank you.

01:03:06.836 --> 01:03:09.079
Hello. ..Michael?

01:03:09.298 --> 01:03:11.919
Bring the gizmo to the poIice station,,,

01:03:12.134 --> 01:03:15.087
Bring the gizmo to the police sta...? Michael!

01:03:32.364 --> 01:03:37.273
- l demand...
- Mr Latello. Mr Harlan.

01:03:37.493 --> 01:03:42.535
- This is Sergeant Jones.
- Tax dollars at work!

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:48.087
- Give me your name.
- Latello's a delinquent anyway, but don't...

01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:51.879
- Mike.
- Tell him all your personal information.

01:03:52.091 --> 01:03:54.798
- Don't do it.
- Michael Harlan.

01:03:55.012 --> 01:03:59.673
- That's him!
- Kiss your asses goodbye!

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:05.606
- That'll be enough outta you, Meatball.
- Chill out, Mr Spock!

01:04:05.815 --> 01:04:11.485
- l don't know what l'm doin' here.
- Tell me a fairy story about this, boys.

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:27.249
You have the right to remain silent.

01:04:27.462 --> 01:04:32.623
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

01:04:32.843 --> 01:04:35.963
- OK, McCloud!
- You have the right to an attorney.

01:05:03.917 --> 01:05:07.915
- Ellie!
- Sherman! What are you doing here?

01:05:08.128 --> 01:05:13.752
Seeing what Harlan and Vince are up to.
l'm warning you, Ellie, they are in big trouble.

01:05:13.969 --> 01:05:19.011
You'd better leave before the police find out
you're involved. l'll cover for you.

01:05:19.224 --> 01:05:22.890
- l'll say Harlan forced you...
- Sherman, get outta my way.

01:05:23.103 --> 01:05:26.519
Wait! So this is what
they were talking about!

01:05:26.732 --> 01:05:29.982
- lt's none of your business.
- What is this thing?

01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:33.895
Leave it alone. lt's dangerous.
You could wind up in a...

01:05:34.116 --> 01:05:36.274
Another dimension?

01:05:39.912 --> 01:05:42.118
This is amazing.

01:05:42.331 --> 01:05:45.167
- lt's absolutely incredible.
- Sherman.

01:05:46.712 --> 01:05:50.292
- Sherman, just give it to me.
- l can't believe it!

01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:51.918
No!

01:06:02.437 --> 01:06:04.973
- Hi, Mom.
- You little cockroach.

01:06:05.189 --> 01:06:07.396
- What? l got boogers?

01:06:07.608 --> 01:06:11.227
Hey, kid.
Why do you wear sunglasses at night?

01:06:11.444 --> 01:06:15.442
When you're cool,
the sun shines on you 24 hours a day.

01:06:15.658 --> 01:06:17.698
Oh, yeah?

01:06:19.621 --> 01:06:22.408
Chill out, Butch! And get a shave.

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.539
The gizmo.

01:06:25.752 --> 01:06:28.206
What the hell happened here?

01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:32.714
- Ellie's at the school. We've gotta get her.
- Let's jam! Let's jam!

01:06:34.762 --> 01:06:37.251
My prisoners! Come back here!

01:06:37.472 --> 01:06:40.177
Where are my god-damn prisoners?

01:06:45.438 --> 01:06:48.391
- Vinnie!
- l've always wanted to do this.

01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:51.445
- Meet me at the school.
- You got it.

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:08.128
Yeah!

01:07:24.396 --> 01:07:27.764
- Head boy Sherman!
- What are you doing here?

01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:30.854
- lt's not my fault.
- Where's Ellie?

01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:33.357
- l didn't know.
- Where is she?

01:07:33.572 --> 01:07:35.730
She's in the tower.

01:07:44.415 --> 01:07:48.000
The school's in the warp.
lt's the end of the world.

01:07:48.213 --> 01:07:52.045
- Cheerful, ain't he?
- You comin' or not?

01:07:52.258 --> 01:07:54.880
- OK. OK.
- Where you goin'?

01:07:55.094 --> 01:07:56.471
l'm comin'!

01:07:56.679 --> 01:08:02.516
But if l wind up in another dimension
like Bobarino, l'm goin' in there packin'!

01:08:03.187 --> 01:08:05.179
Good luck!

01:08:05.397 --> 01:08:11.104
This is no time to be sittin' around
sucking snot! After you, lunch meat!

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.728
No! We'll never come back!

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:22.403
Somethin' tells me
we ain't in Kansas no more, Toto!

01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:26.790
See? l told you guys.
The warp's expanding.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:30.372
Look, it's people from the past
and the future.

01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:32.831
And we're all here together!

01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:37.546
This is like a...
This is like a crossroads of time and space.

01:08:37.807 --> 01:08:40.176
- Yeah.
- Wow!

01:08:43.604 --> 01:08:46.520
l don't believe this. Do you, Mike?

01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:49.437
- No.
- Unreal!

01:08:53.907 --> 01:08:56.609
Radar her!

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:13.171
- Vinnie, keep it under control, all right?
- Danger makes great sex!

01:09:13.385 --> 01:09:16.421
- l'll check you guys out later.
- Come on!

01:09:16.639 --> 01:09:21.798
These are optical delusions like ghosts,
so it's cool. Here comes Latello!

01:09:24.685 --> 01:09:26.813
- Help me!
- Vince!

01:09:31.571 --> 01:09:34.689
Son of a bitch!
What do you call this, wawa?

01:09:34.907 --> 01:09:38.607
Actually, l think you'd call it
a Neanderthal man.

01:09:38.828 --> 01:09:44.700
l don't care what country he's from.
One shot and he's down. l don't believe this.

01:09:44.917 --> 01:09:48.001
- l could be watching ''Magnum''.
- Stop whining!

01:09:48.212 --> 01:09:51.747
Whining?
Barney Rubble just tried to flame me out.

01:09:51.966 --> 01:09:55.417
- You guys, wait up!
- Vinnie, come on!

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:20.864
Hey, scope that faggot in the tutu!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.036
- Paisano!
- We're friends, all right? Friends.

01:10:32.342 --> 01:10:36.554
- What's he saying?
- He's going to kick our ass.

01:10:42.519 --> 01:10:44.309
Come on!

01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:10.336
- He's dead.
- He's been dead a billion years.

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:15.257
Hey, Mike, you OK?

01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:18.632
- Yeah.
- Come on, Sherman. Help him up.

01:11:18.848 --> 01:11:20.971
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:11:23.437 --> 01:11:25.096
Legs! Legs!

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:44.828
- Are we in trouble!
- The warp's getting stronger.

01:11:46.377 --> 01:11:48.997
Get down.

01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:55.963
Get down!

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:59.381
- Exchange students!
- Latello!

01:12:09.067 --> 01:12:10.775
Come on.

01:12:21.662 --> 01:12:23.703
- Vietcong.
- Sh!

01:12:26.169 --> 01:12:27.876
- We're out.
- What?

01:12:28.087 --> 01:12:30.542
- lt's empty.
- Give me that.

01:12:33.508 --> 01:12:36.380
- Back me up, all right?
- You got it.

01:13:05.543 --> 01:13:10.288
- Get their guns! Come on!
- Huh? That's OK. Don't get up!

01:13:10.507 --> 01:13:12.582
Optical delusions, Latello!

01:13:12.801 --> 01:13:17.427
- Thanks. l owe you one.
- Yeah. Take it easy.

01:13:18.014 --> 01:13:19.507
Ciao!

01:13:26.023 --> 01:13:28.311
Let's rest here for a while.

01:13:29.191 --> 01:13:33.983
Hey, round boy.
How d'you learn to fight so good?

01:13:34.198 --> 01:13:36.770
Cliff Notes, Latello!

01:13:36.992 --> 01:13:39.318
How do you work these things?

01:13:39.537 --> 01:13:43.155
Well, according to
''Stoddard's Guide To Modern Weaponry'',

01:13:43.374 --> 01:13:46.458
you eject the spent clip,

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:49.540
you pop the fresh clip into the chamber...

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:55.883
..pull back the cocking mechanism
and you're ready to rock 'n' roll!

01:14:01.685 --> 01:14:03.760
What he say?

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.102
Come on.

01:14:22.539 --> 01:14:24.911
Go ahead! Make my semester!

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.440
Very smart, Latello!

01:14:59.285 --> 01:15:01.408
Latello!

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:05.572
Come on. Put it down.
Would you put it down?

01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:09.920
- Who are these guys?
- Mutants from after the apocalypse.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.179
Let's get outta here.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:30.314
- Come on!
- l don't need this.

01:15:34.198 --> 01:15:38.147
We're gonna get flamed
by something that don't exist yet!

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:41.204
Not in our dimension, but with relativity...

01:15:41.415 --> 01:15:45.661
- Relativity? Shut up, you fat toad.
- Come on, Vinnie!

01:15:45.877 --> 01:15:51.796
- lf it weren't for him we wouldn't be here.
- Look, up the stairs and we're at the lab.

01:15:52.008 --> 01:15:55.043
- Yeah. Or on flippin' Pluto!

01:15:55.887 --> 01:15:57.215
Come on!

01:16:00.725 --> 01:16:03.050
- What is that?
- l don't know.

01:16:03.688 --> 01:16:08.480
My ears are ringing like the ''Gong Show''.
l can't hear nothing.

01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:11.526
And l don't see that neither.

01:16:13.988 --> 01:16:16.609
- Sherman?
- Got me, Mike.

01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:19.909
Terrific! The answer man is stumped.

01:16:21.621 --> 01:16:25.834
This plant has been extinct
for 60 million years.

01:16:26.043 --> 01:16:29.044
Yeah? Well, l ain't never seen one before.

01:16:32.258 --> 01:16:37.087
- You gonna make it, Vinnie?
- Me? l'm so scared l'm thinkin' about God.

01:16:56.951 --> 01:16:59.277
lt's God-funking-zilla!

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.586
Get down.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.598
- l just don't believe it.
- l just want to be home watchin' cartoons.

01:17:30.819 --> 01:17:32.858
Stop talking, OK?

01:17:42.288 --> 01:17:44.366
- Sherman!
- Asshole!

01:17:44.582 --> 01:17:47.039
lt's my allergies.

01:17:50.088 --> 01:17:53.209
l've had it. l'm goin' in. Back me up!

01:17:53.425 --> 01:17:56.960
- Vinnie! What are you doing?
- Come and get me!

01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.723
Latello!

01:18:01.434 --> 01:18:04.553
Suck lead, lizard!

01:18:10.651 --> 01:18:12.311
Vinnie!

01:18:14.239 --> 01:18:15.781
No! What?

01:18:50.944 --> 01:18:52.935
Vinnie!

01:19:03.957 --> 01:19:05.996
Vinnie!

01:19:13.509 --> 01:19:15.999
- You OK?
- Yeah. l think so.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.842
- Where's Vinnie?
- l don't know.

01:19:24.937 --> 01:19:27.940
- Vinnie!
- Oh, man!

01:19:30.902 --> 01:19:32.942
Oh, man. Mikey!

01:19:33.154 --> 01:19:36.569
- Oh, my arm.
- Come on. l got ya.

01:19:36.783 --> 01:19:41.409
- 1 7 years of TV down the drain.
- Yeah. l got ya. Come on.

01:19:43.038 --> 01:19:45.994
- There you go.
- My leg!

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:26.706
All right! The cheque's in the mail!

01:20:35.511 --> 01:20:37.799
Let's go!

01:20:39.015 --> 01:20:41.471
One question, what now?

01:20:41.684 --> 01:20:44.685
We get Ellie and get outta here. Let's go!

01:20:48.982 --> 01:20:52.233
What are you doin'? Let's go! Ready?

01:20:52.446 --> 01:20:54.603
Ready!

01:21:08.878 --> 01:21:11.037
Hit the dirt!

01:21:21.435 --> 01:21:25.016
- Cover me.
- Don't get too close to the gizmo, Mike.

01:21:35.449 --> 01:21:37.155
Ellie!

01:21:38.577 --> 01:21:42.361
- He's been sucked up.
- Shut up. You're making me nuts.

01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:44.870
You're making me crazy!

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:05.930
Ellie?

01:22:15.115 --> 01:22:16.858
Ellie?

01:22:29.964 --> 01:22:33.498
- Look, he's got her, Sherman.
- He's got her!

01:22:41.767 --> 01:22:45.350
- ls she OK?
- She don't look too good, Sherman.

01:22:52.319 --> 01:22:53.945
Ellie?

01:22:54.154 --> 01:22:58.153
- Ellie, l'm so sorry. lf l only knew...
- OK, Sherman.

01:22:58.369 --> 01:23:02.284
- Can you walk?
- The question is, can you run?

01:23:02.497 --> 01:23:05.699
Yeah. Yeah, l can.

01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:08.325
OK. Let's go. Come on.

01:23:09.254 --> 01:23:11.293
Yeah. Fine.

01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:16.668
- We got company.
- Who is it?

01:23:16.886 --> 01:23:20.303
- lt ain't the Brady Bunch!
- We're not home!

01:23:25.522 --> 01:23:27.894
l gotta stop it. Take my gun.

01:23:28.148 --> 01:23:30.473
- Sherman.
- Michael!

01:23:30.694 --> 01:23:32.734
Ellie, get back!

01:23:42.747 --> 01:23:45.998
- Michael!
- Ellie, get back here! Ellie!

01:24:26.835 --> 01:24:29.159
He's gone, l know. Michael!

01:24:56.866 --> 01:24:58.822
Michael!

01:25:00.703 --> 01:25:02.911
Oh, no!

01:25:04.832 --> 01:25:06.625
Michael!

01:25:07.419 --> 01:25:09.044
Michael!

01:25:15.345 --> 01:25:17.051
No.

01:25:22.057 --> 01:25:24.219
- He's gone.
- Mike?

01:25:41.413 --> 01:25:44.164
Mike! He's back!

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:45.997
Michael.

01:25:51.215 --> 01:25:53.623
Michael, are you OK?

01:25:55.509 --> 01:25:58.181
Yeah. l think so.

01:25:58.805 --> 01:26:00.301
Are you?

01:26:00.515 --> 01:26:02.804
l am now!

01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:16.532
Mikey, this is no time for romance here.
Scaramouche! Let's go!

01:26:27.835 --> 01:26:30.041
You thought you heard what?

01:26:37.219 --> 01:26:39.344
Watch out.

01:26:39.971 --> 01:26:44.886
Come on, clear out of here. lt's dangerous.
Keep moving. Stand back.

01:26:55.782 --> 01:26:58.736
You know, Sherman? You're all right.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.949
For a wimp virgin, l mean.

01:27:02.163 --> 01:27:06.909
Coming from a greaseball like you,
l take that as a real compliment.

01:27:07.127 --> 01:27:12.122
Listen.
No one says nothin' about this. OK?

01:27:12.339 --> 01:27:14.083
Yeah, OK.

01:27:14.926 --> 01:27:16.504
All right.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.589
- OK, kids. Get outta here.
- Easy, easy. l'm comin'!

01:27:21.224 --> 01:27:24.177
- So it's out, right?
- Hell, no! We won't go!

01:27:24.395 --> 01:27:27.765
Hell, no! We won't go! Chicago!

01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:31.814
- Mr Roberts?
- Bob?

01:27:32.028 --> 01:27:36.404
Flower-power children,
Beatle concerts, anti-war rallies.

01:27:36.616 --> 01:27:39.071
l'll be dipped in shit!

01:27:39.286 --> 01:27:44.076
- What happened?
- l was blasting through on a tour of the '60s.

01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:48.667
l didn't know what even to say, man!
l mean tripping trip, man!

01:27:48.921 --> 01:27:53.797
- What's your name, cowboy?
- Robert Roberts esquire to you, honky!

01:27:54.049 --> 01:27:58.963
That a fact? Well, Miss Esquire,
where the hell have you been?

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.388
Woodstock - oinker!

01:28:02.934 --> 01:28:05.556
- Woodstock?
- What's Woodstock?

01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:08.771
- OK, Captain Kirk.
- lt's not Boston Pops!

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:12.150
- You got an A in your science project.
- l do?

01:28:12.363 --> 01:28:18.316
On one condition. Get rid of the gizmo.
The world is not ready for space and time.

01:28:18.534 --> 01:28:21.452
lt's only for such rare individuals as myself.

01:28:21.662 --> 01:28:24.201
And the future is a groove, man!

01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:28.789
l made sure of that. lt's a funky high!

01:28:29.004 --> 01:28:32.123
- Get in the car.
- Easy on the fringe, Kojak!

01:29:46.124 --> 01:29:48.665
We're outta gas.

01:29:56.887 --> 01:29:59.803
Well, it's lucky we're close to town.

01:30:02.183 --> 01:30:04.557
l mean, we can walk it.

01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:08.387
Wait a second, Michael.

01:30:08.608 --> 01:30:13.151
lf we walked into town,
the world would know that your car broke...

01:30:17.658 --> 01:30:20.493
lt's just a car.

01:30:21.412 --> 01:30:22.954
Right?

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.534
Right.

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.657
What are you looking at?

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:14.314
Girls, what's for lunch?

01:33:02.706 --> 01:33:05.031
Hey, girls! Boola! Boola!

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.159
- Dykes.
- You little weasel!

01:33:09.305 --> 01:33:15.876
