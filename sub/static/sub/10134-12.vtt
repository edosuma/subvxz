00:02.920 --> 00:06.423
Okay, birthday girl,

00:02.920 --> 00:06.423
it is time to go to sleep.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.801
Not yet,

00:06.465 --> 00:08.801
it's still my birthday.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.803
Come on we've been

00:08.843 --> 00:10.803
celebrating since you woke us up

00:10.845 --> 00:13.722
screaming, "Get up,

00:10.845 --> 00:13.722
it's my birthday!"

00:13.764 --> 00:15.390
Okay, say goodnight, kid.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.851
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.603
I'm four years old.

00:19.645 --> 00:24.274
Well, even four years old girls

00:19.645 --> 00:24.274
need their sleep. Goodnight.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.818
- Goodnight.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.818
- Goodnight, Michelle.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.823
Are you sure there's

00:27.653 --> 00:30.823
no more presents?

00:30.865 --> 00:32.950

Michelle, check out

02:32.820 --> 02:36.156
my project for the science fair.

02:36.197 --> 02:39.868
This is what the inside

02:36.197 --> 02:39.868
of your brain looks like.

02:39.910 --> 02:43.956
I got cauliflower

02:39.910 --> 02:43.956
in my head?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.875
No, but once you put

02:43.998 --> 02:46.875
a lima bean up your nose.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.839
<i>Buenos dias,</i>

02:48.669 --> 02:51.839
<i>las Tanneritas.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:55.134
Eww, sad-looking breakfast.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.847
Kimmy, this is what's

02:56.384 --> 02:59.847
inside your head.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.974
Half a brain.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.394
I don't want dad to see this

03:03.600 --> 03:06.394
until the science fair.

03:06.436 --> 03:11.108
So remember, you guys

03:06.436 --> 03:11.108
never saw my brain.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.071
I never saw it

03:13.902 --> 03:16.071
used anyway.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.409
Girls, gather around. It's time

03:17.906 --> 03:21.409
for a little family meeting.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.495
You know, when Joey

03:21.451 --> 03:23.495
and Uncle Jesse

03:23.537 --> 03:25.330
left this morning

03:23.537 --> 03:25.330
to shoot their commercial

03:25.372 --> 03:27.082
it dawned on me,

03:25.372 --> 03:27.082
this is the first time

03:27.124 --> 03:28.876
we're gonna have a few days

03:27.124 --> 03:28.876
to spend together

03:28.917 --> 03:30.169
just the four of us.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.962
You mean the five of us.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.297
Kimmy, I can count.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.883
The point is there's always

03:34.339 --> 03:35.883
been someone in the house

03:35.924 --> 03:38.510
helping me out,

03:35.924 --> 03:38.510
so this is the first time

03:38.552 --> 03:41.638
I get to spend some time with

03:38.552 --> 03:41.638
you girls all by myself.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.765
So hey, nobody make

03:41.680 --> 03:43.765
dinner plans, okay?

03:43.807 --> 03:45.059
I'm there for you, dad.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.852
Dad, don't forget about

03:45.100 --> 03:46.852
the science fair

03:46.894 --> 03:48.311
after school tomorrow.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.856
I can't wait to see

03:48.353 --> 03:50.856
that big surprise project.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.607
I know what it is.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.234
Michelle.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.361
No, I don't.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.489
- Bye, dad.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.489
- Bye-bye.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.575
Oh, Deej, I got

03:59.531 --> 04:01.575
so wrapped up

04:01.616 --> 04:03.744
in this family togetherness,

04:01.616 --> 04:03.744
I almost forgot.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.830
Kathy Santoni's home

04:03.785 --> 04:06.830
with the stomach flu.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.624
- Alright!

04:09.666 --> 04:11.168
Girls, it's not really nice

04:11.210 --> 04:14.421
to celebrate your friends

04:11.210 --> 04:14.421
digestive disorders.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.173
But I'm her understudy.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.926
This means I get to be Juliet

04:16.215 --> 04:18.926
in the drama festival.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.803
Alright!

04:21.845 --> 04:23.931
It's on Wednesday afternoon.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.931
You'll be there, right?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.766
I wouldn't miss it

04:23.972 --> 04:25.766
for anything.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.145
Okay, Michelle, arms up.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.397
Great, first I'm going to

04:30.187 --> 04:32.397
take you to pre-school

04:32.439 --> 04:35.275
and then I'm going

04:32.439 --> 04:35.275
to go to work

04:35.316 --> 04:37.318
and then do the marketing,

04:35.316 --> 04:37.318
clean the house

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
and Kathy Santoni

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
a get-well card

04:39.154 --> 04:42.032
and still have time to

04:39.154 --> 04:42.032
put a hot dinner on the table.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.242
Impossible, you say?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.534
For the average father, yes.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.538
But not for me,

04:44.576 --> 04:48.538
because I am super dad.

How can dad be at

05:00.801 --> 05:02.594
Stephanie's science fair

05:02.636 --> 05:05.139
when it's the same day

05:02.636 --> 05:05.139
as my drama festival?

05:05.180 --> 05:06.848
He can be in two places at once.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.226
He's super dad.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.320
Joseph, we've been

05:18.777 --> 05:20.320
out here for three hours.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.947
The fox is not coming out.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.824
I hate it out here.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.867
Patience, my friend.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.162
Just think how great our

05:25.909 --> 05:28.162
commercial's gonna be.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.955
When that fox pops

05:28.203 --> 05:29.955
out of his hole

05:29.997 --> 05:31.581
and zips across the forest

05:31.623 --> 05:34.375
as we hear, "Fox fax machines

05:34.417 --> 05:38.421
for a fast fax,

05:34.417 --> 05:38.421
fax with a Fox."

05:38.463 --> 05:41.382
Forget the fox,

05:38.463 --> 05:41.382
I'm freezing my fanny.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.218
Here, take my jacket.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.387
I'm sweating like

05:43.260 --> 05:46.387
a heifer in a hot tub.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.806
Give me that.

Hey, mellow out,<i> amigo.</i>

Animals can sense bad vibes.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.270
Oh, yeah?

05:53.312 --> 05:55.063
Why don't you shoot some good

05:53.312 --> 05:55.063
vibes right in the hole

05:55.105 --> 05:57.983
so the fox will come out

05:55.105 --> 05:57.983
and play with us.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.484
Alright, I will.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.902
Alright.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.572
Yoo-hoo!

06:06.283 --> 06:09.870

06:06.283 --> 06:09.870
Mr. Fox!

06:09.911 --> 06:14.166

06:09.911 --> 06:14.166
neighbor, Mr. Woodchuck.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.337
Would you like to

06:16.210 --> 06:18.337
come out into the forest

06:18.377 --> 06:20.630
and frolic with me?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.926
The trees are made of..

06:24.968 --> 06:26.845
...wood.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.848
Alright, cut the voices.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.893
Stick your hand in there

06:29.890 --> 06:32.893
and yank the fox out.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.978
No way, I know my cartoons.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.146
I put my hand in there

06:36.188 --> 06:38.065
he gives me a stick of dynamite.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.400
Get out of my way.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.070
Alright, you furry-faced rodent

get your little fox buns

06:43.111 --> 06:46.614
out here right now!

06:48.242 --> 06:51.078
They don't listen.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.078
That's it, Joseph.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.831
We'll get the shot at the zoo.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.831
I'm going home.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.046
Hello.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.923
No sudden moves.

You scare that skunk,

07:24.278 --> 07:28.448
Alright, I uh, I got a plan.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.575

No way, I'm not

Come back here!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.658
Great, now what do we do?

08:11.699 --> 08:13.118
Well, let's just sit and enjoy

08:13.160 --> 08:15.287

08:39.686 --> 08:41.646
Jess, you just have

08:39.686 --> 08:41.646
to open yourself up

08:41.688 --> 08:44.274
to the natural beauty

08:41.688 --> 08:44.274
that surrounds us.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.359
What beauty?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.693
There's no central heating

no pizza delivery

08:47.944 --> 08:50.113
no place to plug in

08:50.155 --> 08:51.948
Joseph, if you haven't noticed

08:50.155 --> 08:51.948
there's no people out here.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.617
You want to know why? Because

08:51.990 --> 08:54.617
as soon as man invented cars.

look pretty appetizing.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.282
Thanks for cheering me up,

16:28.905 --> 16:31.282
I was a crab.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.952
I was crabby, too.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.952
I'm sorry, this is great.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.036
What you say? Want to go take

16:33.993 --> 16:36.036
a hike? I'll show you that lake.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.790
Sounds great. I'll grab a couple

16:36.078 --> 16:38.790
granola bars and toilet paper.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.500
- And we're out of here.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.500
- Good.

Hark, o' father, my first scene

17:52.697 --> 17:56.450
begineth at 3:15.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.827
Be thou not late.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.829
I'll be-eth there.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.664
What's that thing

17:59.871 --> 18:01.664
doing back?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.499
I thought we ate it.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.710
My brain, it's alive.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.296
And uncooked, I stayed up

18:05.752 --> 18:09.296
all night finishing it, honey.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.424
This means you can

18:09.338 --> 18:11.424
come to my science fair.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.801
This worked out great.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.970
Yeah, it worked out

18:13.843 --> 18:15.970
great for you.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.096
And for you.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.806
I figured the whole

18:17.137 --> 18:18.806
thing out.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.600
Steph, if I go

18:18.848 --> 18:20.600
to your science fair

18:20.641 --> 18:22.351
and leave at exactly 4:18.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.687
Then , Deej, I'll make it just

18:22.393 --> 18:24.687
in time to see your second scene

18:24.729 --> 18:26.480
from "Romeo and Juliet."

18:26.522 --> 18:28.066
Perfect solution, huh, girls?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.985
But in the second scene,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.985
Juliet's dead.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.780
Too bad you can't

18:31.027 --> 18:33.780
see me when I'm alive.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.155
Bye, dad.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.824
Bye.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.743
And you're gonna

18:36.866 --> 18:38.743
miss the judging.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.704
Which is pretty much

18:38.785 --> 18:41.704
the reason for going.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.208
- Bye, dad.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.208
- Bye, honey.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.676
Let's play horsey,

18:52.465 --> 18:55.676
you be the horse.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.262
Honey, daddy is really tired.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.515
Okay. I'll be the horse.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.269
Okay, daddy's got

19:01.557 --> 19:05.269
a better idea, miss Ed.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.855
Since we've got an hour before

19:05.311 --> 19:07.855
the science fair and the play

19:07.897 --> 19:10.024
why don't you lie down

19:07.897 --> 19:10.024
and take a little nap?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.610
I don't want to take a nap.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.904
Daddy doesn't really care.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.614
Daddy had a hard day at work.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.074
Daddy was up

19:16.656 --> 19:18.074
all night performing

19:18.116 --> 19:20.200
third grade brain surgery.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.662
Daddy says,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.662
you're taking a nap.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.415
I'll tell you what,

19:24.538 --> 19:26.415
I'll even rest with you

19:26.457 --> 19:29.502
for a couple

prize-winning brain.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.743
That you didn't

19:59.782 --> 20:02.743
show up to see!

20:02.785 --> 20:04.328
Dad?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.416
Okay, you little kiss-up,

20:06.956 --> 20:09.416
how did you convince dad

20:09.458 --> 20:11.585
to miss my "Romeo and Juliet?"

20:11.627 --> 20:13.963
What are you talking about?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.963
He missed my science fair.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.715
Then where is he?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.508
I don't know.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.508
I just got home.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.927
Well, dad wouldn't

20:17.550 --> 20:19.927
just not show up.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.974
Do you think something

20:22.471 --> 20:24.974
happened to him?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.852
- Dad!

20:27.894 --> 20:30.437
- Dad! Dad!

20:30.479 --> 20:32.356
- Dad!

20:32.398 --> 20:33.691
- Dad!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.484
Be quiet!

20:35.526 --> 20:39.739
Daddy is sleeping.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.532
Oh, Dad, I'm so glad

20:39.780 --> 20:41.532
you're okay.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
We were so

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
worried about you.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.078
I'm fine.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.665
Six o' clock?

20:46.871 --> 20:49.665
I slept through everything.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.835
It's okay, we're just glad

20:49.707 --> 20:52.835
nothing happened to you.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.420
Girls, I am so sorry.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.755
I wanted to be there so badly

20:55.796 --> 20:58.132
and I let you both down.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.592
You know,

20:58.174 --> 20:59.592
this single parent stuff

20:59.633 --> 21:02.428
is not as easy as

20:59.633 --> 21:02.428
I thought it would be.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.765
We didn't make it

21:02.469 --> 21:05.765
any easier for you.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.892
I'm sorry I was

21:05.806 --> 21:07.892
so selfish today.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.185
I'm sorry, too.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.104
I'm sorry, too.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.982
Michelle, you had nothing

21:12.939 --> 21:14.982
to do with this.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.027
I don't want to be left out.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.863
Oh, come here, honey.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.782
You girls are the greatest.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.034
I must be the luckiest dad

21:22.823 --> 21:25.034
in the whole world.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.536
You're the greatest dad

21:25.076 --> 21:27.536
in the whole world.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.122
Oh, shucks.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.583
So what did the greatest

21:30.539 --> 21:32.583
dad in the world

21:32.625 --> 21:33.960
sleep through today?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.753
Well, the play was great

21:35.795 --> 21:37.004
but Romeo got the hiccups

21:37.046 --> 21:39.339
so we had to cut the

21:37.046 --> 21:39.339
kissing scene short.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.884
Gee, what a shame.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.261
How about you, sweetie?

21:48.057 --> 21:49.850
Alright.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.852
Well, I'm gonna go

21:49.892 --> 21:51.852
get dinner started.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.604
Dad, wait.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.564
You do so much for us.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.191
Let us cook dinner for you.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.068
Great idea.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.068
Come on, Michelle.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.736
You can be our special helper.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.031
Okay, but I'm not setting

22:00.778 --> 22:04.031
that table, mister.
