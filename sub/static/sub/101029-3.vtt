00:47.130 --> 00:48.882
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.842
I shall return momentarily.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.891
Listen, you and I need to have
a little one-on-one seminar

00:57.974 --> 00:59.476

-Look,

01:01.603 --> 01:03.772
you and I are going through
a rough patch, personally,

01:03.855 --> 01:06.608
but I think we're both big enough
not to let it stand in the way.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.903
Look what just arrived in the mail.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.076
-Oh... Hadassah.
-[Hadassah chuckles]

01:16.159 --> 01:17.827
Let me run with it, please?

01:17.911 --> 01:18.787
Actually,

01:18.870 --> 01:20.497
I'm not asking. We're doing it.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.956
We're up 35 points.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.208
-We've won.
-No, no, no.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.086
We win if I run with this.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.712
It's the final nail in his coffin.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.465
-You really wanna do this?
-Mm-hmm.

01:32.383 --> 01:35.011
You're not satisfied beating him?
You wanna ruin his life?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.430
Yes. I think it sends
the right kind of message:

01:37.514 --> 01:39.974
"Dede Standish plays hardball
no matter what,

01:40.058 --> 01:42.477
and she doesn't go easy on insolent,
rich little punks

01:42.560 --> 01:44.187
who never should've run against her."

01:49.025 --> 01:50.693
Fine! I'll call him.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.778
I hate her.

01:52.737 --> 01:53.905
We're destroying him.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.490

03:45.934 --> 03:47.894
at every campaign event
for the foreseeable future.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.187
I was six years old.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.898
This is information that would've
been wise to tell your staff about.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.816
That I dressed up for Halloween
when I was six?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.026
[Andrew] That's my office.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.196
-It's cultural appropriation.
-[Payton] It was a different time, okay?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.740
The idea didn't even exist
in the mainstream ten years ago.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.576
Can't we just say he was dressed
as one of the Village People?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.662

Skye, as Payton's friend,

I think you should stand by his side
on that stage.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.296
You know his heart.
He doesn't see black or white,

04:15.380 --> 04:16.881
or rich or poor. He just sees...

04:50.081 --> 04:51.416
But you gotta understand something.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.085
All of you do.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.672
Cultural appropriation

04:57.755 --> 05:00.508
is when members of a dominant group

05:00.591 --> 05:02.593
exploits the culture
of less privileged groups.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.346
You call it borrowing,
we call it stealing.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.187
about glamorous vampires

05:13.271 --> 05:15.732
puts her hair in cornrows
because it's "fashionable."

05:16.816 --> 05:20.486
There is a thin line between appreciation
and appropriation,

05:20.570 --> 05:23.031
and you've-- you've crossed it, Payton.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.254

[overlapping protests]

06:09.952 --> 06:11.079
Thank you all for coming.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.248
When I was six years old...

06:15.333 --> 06:16.709
I made a terrible mistake.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.964
I chose to go for Halloween as Geronimo,

06:22.382 --> 06:24.217
that noble native chief,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.135
a freedom fighter who gave his life

06:26.219 --> 06:28.554
in the battle against oppression
and tyranny.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.224
Now, while my intention
was to show my first-grade class

06:31.307 --> 06:34.018
how much I admired Geronimo
as a historical icon,

06:34.602 --> 06:37.897
I realize now
that it was deeply, deeply offensive,

06:38.606 --> 06:42.235
not just to the Native American community
but to all people in this country

06:42.318 --> 06:44.320
who strive for a multicultural society.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.906
The temptation might be to say,
"What's the big deal?

06:46.989 --> 06:48.908
He was six years old.
He didn't know any better.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.077
He was still a bed-wetter." But...

06:52.328 --> 06:54.288
I'm sorry, that is not good enough for me.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.790
I should have known better.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.209
I faltered, and I failed.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.004
And for that,
I offer my sincerest apologies

07:02.088 --> 07:04.882
to you, the voter,
and to every single Native American

07:04.966 --> 07:06.259
across this great land.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.596
That I could hurt you
or make you feel less than,

07:10.972 --> 07:14.475
that the clothing of the Bedonkohe band
of the noble Apache

07:14.559 --> 07:16.644
could be worn as a costume...

07:18.521 --> 07:20.314
for this, I truly apologize.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.651
And it's my solemn promise to you today,

07:24.110 --> 07:26.279
I will do better.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.888
This isn't working for me.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.223
This is about orgasm equality?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.809
Because really, it's not Astrid's fault
that she's multi-orgasmic.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.145
My sexual satisfaction is not the issue.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.147
You're both wonderful.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.693
But I've noticed that you're giving Astrid
more attention than me lately.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.948
That's not true, is it?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.409
Honestly, when it all gets going,
I can't even tell who's who.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.161
Payton has soft hands like a woman.

08:17.872 --> 08:22.210
It's subtle but... noticeable,
and trending in the wrong direction.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.255
I see where this could be headed,
and I want to bring attention to it

08:26.339 --> 08:28.382
before resentment sets in.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.926
Hey...

08:31.177 --> 08:32.512
I'm so sorry, Alice.

so let's not mess with it.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.407
I know that was a hard conversation.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.202

08:57.411 --> 08:58.246
[exhales]

08:58.329 --> 08:59.455

09:01.123 --> 09:03.459
I want all of us
to rewatch Gilmore Girls together.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.587
We need to all chip in
to buy higher thread-count sheets

09:06.671 --> 09:07.588
for this bed.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.716
And cuddle time goes
from six minutes to twelve.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.928
I've never actually seen Gilmore Girls,
so that's fine with me.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.306
And I have seen it,
but I'll gladly rewatch.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.519
What do you say we start
those 12 cuddle minutes right now?

09:21.894 --> 09:22.812

09:31.237 --> 09:32.363
[Payton sighs]

09:36.450 --> 09:38.452
Okay. [clears throat]
We are in the homestretch,

09:38.536 --> 09:40.162
and I think it's pretty clear that climate

09:40.246 --> 09:41.747
is the animating issue for our campaign,

09:41.831 --> 09:43.541
and it's what voters
need to be prioritizing,

09:43.624 --> 09:45.042
even if they don't know it.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.130
So, I want a climate event
every day this week.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.756
Let's go ahead and start brainstorming

09:50.840 --> 09:51.882
what those could be.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.801
Let's see. Um...

09:54.302 --> 09:55.803
[clucking] Okay. Bad pitch.

like polar bears.

We moan,

10:00.558 --> 10:03.269
and we pretend to die
from lack-of-salmon hunger.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.981
I'm writing it down.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.608
[phones dinging]

10:11.902 --> 10:13.487
-Did you get that?
-Yeah.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.866
Emerson College poll came out.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.868
It has you down 29 points.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.580
That means the speech worked.
We've stabilized.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.706
Yeah, but, Payton...

10:25.708 --> 10:26.667
I'm gonna lose.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.004
I know. [chuckles]

10:32.715 --> 10:33.633
I know.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.387
Look, this hurts, okay?
I really can't tell you...

10:39.847 --> 10:42.725
[sighs] ...I can't tell you how much
this hurts, and I didn't expect

10:42.808 --> 10:46.312
that this is the way
that all of this was gonna end,

10:46.646 --> 10:47.563
but...

10:48.189 --> 10:51.317
but I've known all along that--
that there was probably no way

10:51.400 --> 10:52.777
for me to win this.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.487
You know?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.781
We all knew what this was going in.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.870
We were crazy... to think
we could pull this off. [chuckles]

11:02.953 --> 11:04.372
And we did not...

11:06.540 --> 11:07.583
and that's fine.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.922
Because we were noble friends,
together again.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.091
And we believed in something.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.014
A few years ago,

11:23.057 --> 11:25.601
I mean, if we're being honest,
probably a few days ago,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.603
I would've been pulling out all my hair

11:27.687 --> 11:29.980
and chucking chairs through the windows.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.109
But I guess I've changed.
I'm very proud of what we did here.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.028
I stayed true to who I was,

11:37.571 --> 11:39.532
and I ran the campaign
that I wanted to run.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.867
Who do you think sent the picture
to Dede's campaign?

11:44.161 --> 11:45.079
I don't know.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.834
But I choose to live in today
and what we do know.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.544
So, from this point forward,

11:52.044 --> 11:56.006
ha, no matter how much we... lose by,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.217
I want us focused on the next campaign,

11:58.300 --> 12:00.678
when, hopefully,
time heals all wounds, and...

12:02.138 --> 12:03.055
I am...

12:03.764 --> 12:04.724
uncanceled.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.060
Now, I don't know what that is yet, and,

12:08.144 --> 12:10.312
you know, a part of me
doesn't really care, to be honest,

12:10.396 --> 12:12.148
because as long as I keep fighting

12:13.149 --> 12:14.775
for the issues that I believe in

12:15.317 --> 12:18.237
and I do it in a way
that other people can believe in too,

12:19.113 --> 12:20.072
then...

12:21.490 --> 12:23.159
the campaign will reveal itself.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.664
-[music plays softly over speakers]
-[patrons chattering]

12:30.750 --> 12:31.834
[exhales]

12:33.461 --> 12:36.422
-It's so good to see you.
-Hi, Andrew. Don't get up. [clears throat]

12:36.881 --> 12:38.549
Thank you so much for doing this.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.843
I've been dreaming about this
for a long time. 

12:40.926 --> 12:43.137
Yes, Payton did say that.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.348
Also, you text me that... a lot.

12:46.432 --> 12:51.270
Sorry about that,
but, you know, I love you, Infinity,

12:51.353 --> 12:54.690
and love is a... a many-splendored thing.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.902
-Mm-hmm.
-It can drive you a little bit crazy.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.653
[both laughing]

12:59.737 --> 13:01.071
It can, can't it?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.407
Really glad that you brought that up,

13:03.491 --> 13:05.868
um, because this is crazy.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.703
Yeah, and it's not romantic crazy,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.414
it's just crazy-crazy,

13:10.498 --> 13:12.500
and I'm respecting you enough
as a human being

13:12.583 --> 13:13.667
to tell you this in person,

13:13.751 --> 13:16.212
and then this will be the last time
I communicate with you again

13:16.295 --> 13:17.838
-for the rest of my life, okay?
-Wait--

13:17.922 --> 13:19.840
Not finished.
When you text a girl you love her,

13:19.924 --> 13:22.885
you should (a) think,
"Is this a normal thing to say to somebody

13:22.968 --> 13:24.595
who I don't ever see in person?"

13:24.678 --> 13:26.680
And (b) when that person texts you back,

13:26.764 --> 13:30.226
"I'm sorry, I'm just not interested,"
that should really be the end of it.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.685
It's also quite inappropriate

13:31.769 --> 13:33.938
for Payton to have set this meeting up,
don't you think?

13:34.021 --> 13:37.358
Like, I don't know,
a date with me as payment

13:37.775 --> 13:40.277
for some freelance campaign work?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.737
-[whispers] No.
-I do not care

13:41.821 --> 13:43.697
what the rigors of an election may be.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.408
This is extremely upsetting,

13:46.492 --> 13:47.785
-and I told him so.
-[server] Hi.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.664
-Would you two like to see a wine list?
-No, I-- Nope. Nope. No wine, no food.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.665
Thank you.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.292
Look, I have had enough weird, toxic,

13:55.376 --> 13:58.712
borderline-abusive-slash-actually-abusive
male behavior in my life, Andrew.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.755
I dated Ricardo.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.801
So you, my friend, are canceled.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.178
See you never again.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.474
-Ever.
-Infinity, wait. Don't--

14:15.145 --> 14:19.233
[Infinity] It never ceases to amaze
how good it feels to say no to things.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.485
I'm doing it whenever I can now,

14:21.777 --> 14:23.028
canceling my bad habits.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.405
And I can honestly say

14:24.780 --> 14:26.031
I feel like a new person.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.868
It started a year ago.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.828
I was in Beijing on my book tour,

14:31.120 --> 14:32.413
and I looked out at the city,

14:32.496 --> 14:34.999
-and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
-[coughing]

14:35.082 --> 14:36.834
The air was toxic.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.961
The exhaust from five million cars,

14:39.044 --> 14:41.672
coal plants belching fumes
24 hours a day...

14:44.717 --> 14:49.471
This planet is the only place
in the universe that we can call home,

14:50.055 --> 14:51.265
and we are trashing it.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.059
In the last 70 years,

14:54.685 --> 14:57.855
we have generated
eight billion tons of plastic,

14:58.647 --> 15:00.232
and it doesn't go anywhere.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.818
What can I do?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.862
-[loud blowing]
-What can any of us do?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.906
Our future is being dictated

15:06.989 --> 15:10.868
by these enormous global forces
that no one person can control.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.245
The problem is just too massive.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.080
And then I noticed something.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.626
In the three days that I was in Beijing,

15:18.709 --> 15:22.880
I generated three trash bags
full of waste.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.466
The problem didn't exist outside of me.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.760
I was part of it.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.179
At that moment,

15:30.638 --> 15:31.639
I decided

15:31.889 --> 15:34.934
that for one year,
I was gonna live a life of zero waste.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.438
Overnight, I felt like a new person.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.899
If it came in a package,

15:42.691 --> 15:43.651
I didn't buy it.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.362
I carried a tote bag
with a couple of jars,

15:47.154 --> 15:48.614
a reusable coffee cup,

15:49.657 --> 15:51.283
-a metal straw.
-Yay.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.828
Thank you.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.413
I brought my own bags.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.750
Any bottles at home, I reused.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.253
I switched from tampons
to a menstrual cup,

16:03.337 --> 16:05.005
which I actually like way better now.

16:05.089 --> 16:05.923
Huh.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.383
Hey-yay!

16:07.466 --> 16:08.467
Hi.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.053
Oh, I also got a worm farm in my kitchen,
which is so fun.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.930
You'd think it'd smell,
but it doesn't at all.

16:13.013 --> 16:13.931
Bye, you guys.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.142
I even started a compost group
at my local park.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.021
And by the end of the year...

16:21.355 --> 16:22.189
[sighs]

16:22.272 --> 16:26.735
...all the waste that I'd generated
fit into a single Mason jar.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.074
And this is not to say
that I'm some sort of hero.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.159
That's the whole point. I am not.

16:34.910 --> 16:38.122
I am just one person doing something
that we all can do.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.290
Real change in this city

16:40.374 --> 16:42.584
and in this country happens
when we look at ourselves

16:42.668 --> 16:44.712
and ask what we can do.

16:45.629 --> 16:46.505
And for me,

16:47.715 --> 16:51.510
going zero waste was literally
the most fulfilling thing I've ever done

16:51.593 --> 16:52.469
in my entire life.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.638
I went from feeling worried

16:54.722 --> 16:56.557
and-- and afraid for our future

16:56.640 --> 16:59.768
to feeling hopeful
for where our country is headed.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.062
But I promise you,

17:03.272 --> 17:04.314
the best thing

17:04.648 --> 17:06.817
that each and every one of us
here today can do

17:07.192 --> 17:08.694
is register to vote.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.447
And when we go to the voting booth
on November 5th,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.991
we can cast our vote for Payton Hobart.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.327
Let us help him enact
the kind of generational change

17:17.411 --> 17:18.370
that this planet needs.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.040
This is an emergency.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.083
But help is on the way.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.587
Ladies and gentlemen,
my dear friend Payton Hobart!

17:26.670 --> 17:28.714
[applause]

17:28.797 --> 17:30.674
-She's good.
-I know, right?

17:36.513 --> 17:38.599
Thank you so much, everyone,
and thank you to Infinity.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.767
Such a huge inspiration.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
-Thank you.
-I gotta tell you, we've counted,

17:41.643 --> 17:44.354
and there are 98 people in this room
who have registered to vote today

17:44.438 --> 17:45.397
-for the first time.
-Wow!

17:45.481 --> 17:47.441
Can we see a show of hands
of who those people are?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.860
-Well, that deserves a round of applause.
-Yay! Amazing!

17:49.943 --> 17:52.029
-Congratulations, everyone.
-Amazing!

17:53.113 --> 17:55.449
Thank you, guys,
for doing this little follow-up.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.784
[giggles]

17:56.867 --> 17:57.826
Payton,

17:58.786 --> 18:00.370
I believe in this campaign.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.499
I mean, I think you have a real,
unique opportunity

18:03.582 --> 18:06.085
to inspire the voters
that we're gonna need

18:06.168 --> 18:09.046
if we're gonna have any shot
at saving this planet.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.424
Yes, exactly. Thank you, and we--
we so appreciate your support.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.176
-It means the world to--
-But I have to say,

18:14.927 --> 18:17.429
at that event, I saw you both
engage in behavior

18:17.513 --> 18:19.139
that I found very disturbing

18:19.223 --> 18:22.226
and will need to be addressed
if you want my support to continue.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.564
Payton, I saw you take your suit jacket
out of a plastic dry cleaning bag

18:27.648 --> 18:29.608
and put it and the hanger
right in the trash.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.071
That-- That's it?

18:35.239 --> 18:38.659
Oh, my God. Yes, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. That was-- That was bad.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.121
And I presume you didn't even bother
to take it to an eco-friendly dry cleaner?

18:42.454 --> 18:43.872
Oh, you-- you know what?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.500
-I d-- don't think I did.
-M'kay.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.795
So, those chemicals are toxic,
and they're now in the ocean.

18:49.878 --> 18:50.712
Skye,

18:51.130 --> 18:52.214
at the same event,

18:52.297 --> 18:55.217
I saw you chew gum.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.226
Um...

19:04.434 --> 19:05.352
Yes?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.146
Was it a natural gum?

19:08.730 --> 19:11.024
-Probably not. [chuckles]
-So what you had in your mouth

19:11.108 --> 19:12.151
were petroleum by-products:

19:12.234 --> 19:14.820
petroleum wax, butadiene-styrene rubber,

19:14.903 --> 19:17.823
-and polyisobutylene polyvinyl acetate.
-[Payton] Ew.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.324
That gum will exist forever.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.659
When the Earth is dead,

19:20.742 --> 19:22.744
that gum will still be there.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.289
Okay, I-- I do think that we know
what you're saying.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.498
We could all be doing better.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.960
No, actually, what I'm saying is,
I don't see you doing anything, Payton.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.629
You've taken on this "issue," right?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.423
Possibly in good faith,

19:34.506 --> 19:36.758
but your actions
don't match your rhetoric.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.594
And if that were to get out,

19:38.677 --> 19:42.222
not only would it destroy the credibility
of your campaign

19:42.306 --> 19:44.308
but also the credibility of the movement
as a whole,

19:44.391 --> 19:45.309
and I...

19:46.393 --> 19:47.728
I will not stand for that.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.398
[papers rustling]

19:51.481 --> 19:53.692
-Um, what's that?
-Oh, this is a checklist.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.570
Fifteen simple steps
that you guys can take

19:56.653 --> 19:58.614
to zero out waste
and reduce your carbon footprint

19:58.697 --> 20:00.199
to an absolute minimum.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.784
Hold up.
You're asking me to go zero waste?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.995
And reduce your carbon footprint
to an absolute minimum.

20:05.078 --> 20:05.913
Skye has to, too.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.789
Demonstrate your commitment
to the movement,

20:07.873 --> 20:10.876
or I will tell everybody you're a fraud,
and you will be... [grunts]

20:10.959 --> 20:12.586
-...canceled.
-Wait, what?

20:12.920 --> 20:15.297
Payton, this is for your own good.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.216
And if you want my support

20:17.299 --> 20:20.135
and the support
of my many, many, many followers,

20:21.136 --> 20:22.512
this is my price.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.973
"Cold showers only, with plug in tub.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.435
Use leftover water for cooking,
cleaning, and drinking"?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.519
Yeah, you just boil it.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.604
I'm vegan now?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.940
-Infinity, this is insane.
-Insanely simple!

20:35.776 --> 20:37.569
I want full compliance in 24 hours.

20:40.030 --> 20:43.659
Oh! Payton, please stop going around town
peddling dates with me

20:43.742 --> 20:46.536
like it's some weird form of currency.
It's gross, and it's toxic, okay?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.666
I'll see you guys later. K, bye!

21:01.677 --> 21:03.679
[siren wails in distance]

21:14.773 --> 21:16.275
[desk phone ringing]

21:40.882 --> 21:43.468
[cackling]

21:43.677 --> 21:47.014
Oh, no. Dede! [laughing]

21:47.097 --> 21:49.057
-[Dede] When is this from?
-[Hadassah] Don't know.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.059
It looks like somebody took it
off his cell phone.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.228
It couldn't be
more than a couple of weeks ago.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.981
What the hell is wrong with this kid?

21:56.064 --> 21:59.276
He seems to have some kind
of super-specific fetish or something.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.070
Do we have any idea
who's sending us these messages? 

22:02.362 --> 22:04.865
Ugh. A gift horse comes galloping in here,

22:04.948 --> 22:06.533
and you're worried about who's riding it?

22:06.616 --> 22:08.535
If someone hacked his cell phone,

22:08.618 --> 22:10.996
we are in possession of stolen material.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.414
Okay, okay.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.459
But that doesn't mean
we can't use it to our advantage.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.260
[Skye] Did you do it?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.888
-Let me see it.
-[muffled] See what?

22:28.305 --> 22:30.640
[chuckles] Don't play dumb.
Let me see it, your checklist.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.725
Why? I did them all.

22:31.808 --> 22:32.934
-Bullshit.
-I swear to God.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.897
Okay. Let's compare checklists,
then, shall we?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.440
Let's see.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.985
Oh, here we are:
worm farm and compost bin.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.404
Hmm. Check, check. Arrived this morning.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.115
The worms are currently eating
the boxes they came in.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.035
You have not handwashed all your clothing.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.371
Yes, well,
this outfit I am rewearing, so...

22:53.580 --> 22:55.665
I do smell a little bit,

22:55.749 --> 22:58.418
but I'm not breaking rules because
when I wash it, I will handwash it.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.088
I also turned off the heat 
in my dorm room, installed LED lights,

23:01.171 --> 23:04.091
and I got these socks at a thrift shop.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.926
No tissues, so...

23:06.009 --> 23:07.386
-Handkerchief!
-...handkerchief!

23:07.469 --> 23:08.428
Okay.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.180
Uh, vegan salad.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.556
I got a low-flow showerhead.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.101
I snuck onto the roof of my dorm
and put a rain barrel up there.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.685
Aluminum foil behind the radiators.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.938
Reusable cup, straw, to-go container.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.481
And I paid a handsome sum to the IATA

23:19.564 --> 23:22.275
to offset the carbon emissions
from every flight I have ever been on.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.820
-So, done.
-Wow.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.239
Impressive. [chuckles]

23:27.614 --> 23:29.491
Um... Ooh, let's see.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.034
What about...

23:31.493 --> 23:32.494
number 15?

23:33.328 --> 23:37.082
-Yeah, no. I think those were all 15.
-Wait, let me see. I'm just gonna read it.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.960
Uh, "Use your leftover shower water

23:40.043 --> 23:42.421
for drinking, cooking, and cleaning."

23:42.504 --> 23:44.381
Okay. No, Skye, no. I can't do that.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.507
That's insane, all right?

23:45.590 --> 23:49.177
My one pleasure in life is taking
long, hot, masturbatory showers,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.638
and I will not be giving that up, okay?
How's this a problem?

23:51.721 --> 23:54.141
The water gets heated up downstairs
in the fucking boiler room.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.017
If I don't use it, somebody else will.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.894
Then what? I'm supposed to save the water

23:57.978 --> 24:00.522
that I've just bathed in
so that I can boil it and drink it?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.108
That's like something
out of a North Korean reeducation camp.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.359
No one should have to do that.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.527
That is not sanitary.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.657
You lying, phony piece of shit.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.451
Skye... Skye!

24:12.534 --> 24:14.244
You know who took
a cold shower this morning

24:14.327 --> 24:16.997
and stood in a little bin
and boiled the water that was left over?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.123
-You didn't.
-Oh, I did.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.167
And I made my coffee with it.
And you know what?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.460
That shit tasted disgusting!

24:21.543 --> 24:22.919
Okay. We can just say I did it.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.546
Motherfucker, no!

24:24.838 --> 24:26.840
I had to boil and drink
my own booty water!

24:26.923 --> 24:28.175
If I have to do it, so do you.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.718
-No.
-Get your ass out of that chair.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.053
-We're going to your dorm.
-No way. I'm not doing it.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.889
Wow. Okay, cool.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.266
Guess I'm just gonna have
to call Infinity.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.936
Infinity. That's her number.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.646
I'm dialing, and--

24:41.730 --> 24:42.814
Okay, fine! I'll do it!

24:43.648 --> 24:46.234
Attaboy.
And it's the perfect time of day, too.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.487
A nice cup of booty coffee
gonna perk you right up.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.281
-[Skye] I'm proud of you.
-Shut up. This is insane.

24:52.365 --> 24:55.160
Okay, okay, you're gonna time it, right?
Just two minutes.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.371
You can do this, Payton.
Pain is all in your mind, you know?

24:58.455 --> 25:01.666
And you're gonna have a nice,
fragrant cup of coffee coming your way.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.168
Shut up. I need to concentrate.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.254
Okay, just turn it on. That's fine.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.633
[Payton exhales slowly, groans]

25:09.716 --> 25:11.551
You do it, okay?
Turn it on. Just turn it on.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.220
-All right.
-[shrieks]

25:13.303 --> 25:16.431
Okay! No, no, no! No, I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing that, I'm not doing that.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.849
-Okay? No.
-Okay. All right.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.643
Not happening.
Don't care what Infinity says.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.186
Can I have the towel? It's freezing.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.395
-Okay, thank you.
-Here.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.773
Ooh! Who in their right mind
would ever do that?

25:24.856 --> 25:25.899
Jesus Christ!

25:25.982 --> 25:27.943
What kind of country is it
we're trying to build?

25:28.026 --> 25:30.529
Know what I mean? It's a moral question
when you come down to it.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.531
Because that was worse
than getting waterboarded.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.366
I cannot stand here and say 
that anybody

25:34.449 --> 25:35.951
-should subject themselves to that.
-[phone rings]

25:36.034 --> 25:38.119
And children? What?
Mothers are gonna have their babies

25:38.203 --> 25:39.996
-forced to sit in freezing water?
-You good?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.832
Because, honestly, I'm not here for that.
I'm not here for it!

25:43.250 --> 25:44.668
[exhales sharply] Hello?

25:50.173 --> 25:51.174
[door shuts]

25:56.346 --> 25:58.723
Payton Hobart is here.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.728
Thank you for coming, Payton.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.522
Please, sit down.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.527
Uh, I do have a campaign to get back to,
so if we could keep this brief.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.987
Of course. [chuckles]

26:12.070 --> 26:13.905
You have a lot of ground to make up.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.490
And if this got out,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.867
it certainly wouldn't help. [laughs]

26:17.951 --> 26:18.910
You can have that.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.163
I have tons of copies, needless to say.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.457
That looks like a pretty recent photo

26:24.541 --> 26:26.418
with a Geronimo headdress

26:26.501 --> 26:29.004
and then the-- the Speedo.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.046
[Hadassah chuckles]

26:32.674 --> 26:33.758
Who sent this to you?

26:34.509 --> 26:35.635
How'd you get this?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.513
A better question, I think, would be...

26:38.597 --> 26:39.764
what's with you and Geronimo?

26:39.848 --> 26:40.724
[scoffs]

26:41.182 --> 26:42.392
I'm so sorry, Hadassah.

26:42.475 --> 26:43.768
I'm sorry that I like something.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.938
Sorry that I find Geronimo inspiring,
okay?

26:47.022 --> 26:49.774
Am I a little obsessed with him?
Yeah, actually, I think I kind of am.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.902
Who else's name has become
a literal verb? Hmm?

26:52.986 --> 26:54.904
A war cry to ignore danger

26:54.988 --> 26:56.865
and sacrifice yourself if you have to?

26:56.948 --> 26:58.950
The man watched his wife and children
get murdered,

26:59.034 --> 27:00.285
and he still kept fighting.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.496
He fought his entire life for the idea
of an independent Indian nation,

27:03.580 --> 27:05.040
so I am so, so sorry

27:05.123 --> 27:07.334
if polite society says
I'm not allowed to like him.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.293
Okay? I'm so sorry

27:08.376 --> 27:11.212
if sometimes when I feel down,
I like to put the headdress on,

27:11.296 --> 27:13.089
think about Geronimo, okay?

27:13.173 --> 27:14.966
Who he was
and what his life must've been like.

27:15.050 --> 27:15.884
And I-- And I feel,

27:16.551 --> 27:17.636
mmm, I don't know, inspired,

27:17.719 --> 27:19.596
and-- and-- and,
I don't know, powerful even?

27:19.679 --> 27:21.848
-But why the Speedo?
-I look great in the Speedo.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.642
-Yeah.
-Okay? I look great in the headdress.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.810
So I thought, why not try the Speedo
and the headdress?

27:25.894 --> 27:29.022
And you know what? I look awesome, okay?

27:29.105 --> 27:31.983
I think that Geronimo would agree,
actually, that I look awesome, okay?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.318
I stand by this photo.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.070
You need deep psychological help.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.031
Why don't you put it up already?
Get it over with and put it on Twitter.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.282
We can all just call it a day.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.951
Know what? I'll do you one better,
and I'll put it up myself, okay?

27:42.035 --> 27:43.411
Then we can all just call it a day.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.747
Because I'll tell you one thing:
I will not live in fear!

27:48.291 --> 27:50.794
I have no intention of doing that.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.673
[exhales] Well, then,
what the hell am I doing here?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.383
Well, one of your people,

27:56.466 --> 27:58.259
someone on your staff,
I think it was the girl

27:58.343 --> 28:00.845
-with the big Gloria Steinem glasses.
-Yeah. Yeah, the one

28:00.929 --> 28:02.305
who wears the pastel suits.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.516
Looks like a sherbet Diane Keaton,
which I love.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.975
-Mm-hmm.
-She's been digging around,

28:06.059 --> 28:06.893
and it's gotta stop.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.604
She contacted one of my old professors

28:09.688 --> 28:13.525
and tried to get her to go on record
saying that I had plagiarized a term paper

28:13.608 --> 28:15.860
-on Robert Moses.
-Did you?

28:16.903 --> 28:17.737
N-- No.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.532
So, if you don't want this to come out,

28:20.615 --> 28:21.658
call off your dogs.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.451
The campaign is over, and we have won.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.037
You leave us alone,
and we'll leave you alone.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.039
You'll lose this race,

28:28.832 --> 28:30.500
but you'll have a future, okay?

28:30.834 --> 28:31.960
And when I win,

28:33.086 --> 28:35.296
I'll praise your fighting spirit

28:36.172 --> 28:38.091
and set you up for the next campaign.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.387
You got that?

28:46.099 --> 28:46.975
Okay.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.022
Payton,

28:54.315 --> 28:55.608
you ran a good campaign.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.277
You should be proud.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.571
You just aimed a little too high,
that's all.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.322
Start small.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.075
Run for school board or something.
Work your way up.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.754
Aren't you worried about paparazzi
down on the beach spotting us? 

29:16.171 --> 29:18.298
We're not as interesting
as you think we are.

29:18.715 --> 29:19.758
At least you're not.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.342
Not yet, anyway.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.013
Aah.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.391
So, the monster's climate change, right?

29:28.933 --> 29:29.893
[Georgina] Mmm.

29:30.143 --> 29:34.105
If wild beasts came to California
and started setting everything on fire

29:34.189 --> 29:36.524
and leveling islands and drowning cities,

29:36.608 --> 29:38.485
you can bet your sweet bottom
nobody would ask

29:38.568 --> 29:40.445
how much it would cost to kill them.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.867
I've had the campaign
put look-alikes of us all around the state

29:45.950 --> 29:47.660
to draw the press attention away.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.872
They're like kittens
chasing laser pointers.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.958
It defies every rule of politics

29:54.042 --> 29:56.878
for you to just disappear
this close to an election.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.671
I'm 45 points ahead.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.756
I'm pulling a Garbo.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.300
I've got staffers tweeting
every couple of days

30:02.383 --> 30:04.010
and surrogates doing talk shows.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.553
I'm a mystery.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.681
I'm in love with you.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.268
Oh, God. Please don't be.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.272
I've got some new polling data,
hot off the presses.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.691
I am 14 days away

30:18.775 --> 30:21.277
from when over 67 percent of likely voters

30:21.361 --> 30:23.404
think it's appropriate for me

30:23.488 --> 30:24.614
to start dating.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.574
No way.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.202
I've had ten doctors look
at my wife's charts.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.287
Her brain is applesauce.

30:31.371 --> 30:35.625
She is never waking up.
It's time for me to move on...

30:37.043 --> 30:37.919
with you.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.921
No more sneaking around,

30:41.047 --> 30:42.632
loads of free press.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.303
You don't think that sneaking around
is the best thing about us?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.847
Not for a second.

30:50.181 --> 30:54.352
Georgina, you are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.273
Okay, fine,

30:59.649 --> 31:01.025
but if it doesn't work out,

31:01.526 --> 31:04.904
promise me you will not throw yourself
out a window.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.200
[Payton] Thank you for having
this conversation outside.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.452
I don't trust
that we are not being bugged.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.329
Why are you covering your mouth?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.498
[Payton] In case
there are lip-readers spying on us.

31:15.582 --> 31:16.749
Mmm? Mm-hmm?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.337
Certainly possible.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.090
-Wait, you really think so?
-No, dumbass.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.675
You're running for state senate,

31:25.758 --> 31:27.760
and you're losing by, like, 170 points.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.471
Nobody cares enough
to hire professional lip-readers

31:30.555 --> 31:32.724
to find out
what your next shrewd political move is.

31:32.807 --> 31:33.850
[Payton scoffs]

31:34.684 --> 31:36.019
I need to know who's doing this.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.062
The yearbook photo was your twin brothers.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.357
What? How do you know that?

31:41.441 --> 31:44.527
I mean, I'm gonna need some proof.
Was there fingerprints on the envelope?

31:44.611 --> 31:45.653
[whisper] Like, DNA?

31:47.113 --> 31:49.032
I called them, numbnuts.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.617
[line ringing]

31:50.700 --> 31:52.535
-[phone rings]
-[sighs]

31:52.619 --> 31:54.162
[instructor speaks indistinctly]

31:54.245 --> 31:55.622
-Hello?
-This is Andrew.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.874
I work on your brother's campaign.
Is now a good time?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.376
No, we're, uh-- we're working.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.046
Then why do I hear yoga sounds
in the background?

32:03.129 --> 32:04.839
-What do you want?
-Did you two send

32:04.923 --> 32:07.634
the yearbook picture of Payton
dressed like Geronimo?

32:07.717 --> 32:10.386
-Yes, we did.
-[both laughing]

32:11.512 --> 32:12.388
They just admitted it?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.098
I've never met anyone whose enemies

32:14.182 --> 32:16.726
take so much pride and pleasure
in destroying them.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.895
People really hate you.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.396
[Payton] Hmm.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.483
Ooh, did you ask if they sent the photo
from my phone?

32:23.566 --> 32:24.734
I didn't have to.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.860
I know they didn't.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.862
-I did my own forensic study...
-Careful.

32:27.946 --> 32:28.988
...of the photograph.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.366
It wasn't hacked from your phone.
Someone took a picture

32:31.449 --> 32:32.784
of the picture. See?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.953
You can see the edges
of your lame phone case

32:35.036 --> 32:36.204
in the top corner of the shot.

32:37.914 --> 32:38.790
Oh, my God.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.959
But that's not possible.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.252
Nobody that hates me has been
close enough to my phone.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.671
Unless...

32:46.714 --> 32:48.049
The leak is coming from within.

32:51.177 --> 32:54.180
This is a photo of me
in a Geronimo headdress

32:54.263 --> 32:56.349
and a tight-fitting red Speedo.

32:57.558 --> 32:58.685
I was given this photo

32:59.811 --> 33:01.562
by Dede Standish herself.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.692
Someone in this room sent it to her.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.488
And I would like to know who that was.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.907
Hold on.
What makes you think it was one of us?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.284
Yeah, maybe they figured out
how to hack your phone.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.578
Let's look very closely, shall we?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.539
This is not a hacked image, okay?

33:19.622 --> 33:22.917
A photo was taken of the image
by someone who was holding my phone.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.586
Like all of you, I consider this device
to be an appendage

33:25.670 --> 33:26.713
of my personal body.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.424
-I sleep with it.
-[contented sigh]

33:29.841 --> 33:31.134
I shower with it.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.429
The only time that I was away
from my phone

33:34.512 --> 33:36.139
for longer than a minute in the past week

33:36.639 --> 33:39.100
was two days ago
when all of us were here in this room,

33:39.183 --> 33:40.727
and I saw a rat.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.353
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, there's a rat!

33:42.437 --> 33:44.105
-There's a rat! Jesus!
-[screaming]

33:44.188 --> 33:45.732
[panicked chatter]

33:45.815 --> 33:47.734
-Ow! Fuck! Shit!
-[Skye] Here we go. Here we go.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.404
[Payton] While I was out of the room,
somebody went through my phone,

33:51.487 --> 33:53.448
found the image, and took a photo of it,

33:53.531 --> 33:55.116
and I need to know who that was.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.248
What is happening here, you guys?

34:02.331 --> 34:03.499
It was me.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.046
I was feeling... jealous.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.339
[Payton] Ow! Fuck! Shit!

34:10.757 --> 34:13.176
[Alice] And I wanted to make sure

34:13.259 --> 34:15.344
that there weren't any photos of you
and Astrid

34:15.678 --> 34:17.305
doing something that we hadn't agreed on.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.520
-Wait, what?
-Sometimes we have sex together

34:24.604 --> 34:25.772
and watch Gilmore Girls.

34:25.855 --> 34:26.731
Deal with it.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.902
I saw that photo,
and I was really confused.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.113
You took that photo just a few days ago,

34:34.197 --> 34:36.783
and... I didn't know what to do,

34:36.866 --> 34:38.618
so I sent it to James.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.580
It's a weird photo, Payton.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.623
After Alice sent it,

34:43.706 --> 34:46.501
I sent it to Astrid, Skye, and McAfee
so we could figure out

34:46.584 --> 34:49.879
-if we needed to do an intervention.
-Traitors. Traitors, all of you!

34:49.962 --> 34:52.507
We just wanted to know, like,
how often you wear the headdress.

34:52.590 --> 34:56.719
And, like, is it always with the Speedo,
or just, like, sometimes?

34:56.803 --> 34:59.263
But... we kept it in-house.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.348
We didn't leak the photo.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.058
[Payton] Hmm.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.267
[McAfee] I did.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.772
-What?
-You've gotta be kidding me.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.900
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it.
But you lied, Payton.

35:10.983 --> 35:14.070
You gave this whole speech
about how it was just a costume you wore

35:14.153 --> 35:15.029
when you were six,

35:15.113 --> 35:17.448
when this photo proves
that that isn't the case.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.700
This is something you do all the time,
evidently.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.993
You weren't being honest,

35:21.077 --> 35:22.703
and it was going to come out
at some point.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.081
And I figured if we were giving up
on this campaign

35:25.164 --> 35:26.374
and looking to the next one,

35:26.457 --> 35:29.669
then we should get this weird,
Geronimo-in-a-Speedo fetish thing

35:29.752 --> 35:30.795
out of the way now

35:30.878 --> 35:31.838
so that it comes out

35:31.921 --> 35:34.298
during a campaign you're gonna lose
rather than the next one

35:34.382 --> 35:35.800
that you might actually win.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.678
We're done.

35:41.764 --> 35:42.723
Just get out.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.016
Okay? You're canceled.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.436
We've been through this rage cycle
with you two before.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.063
-It's reductive.
-[McAfee] Please!

35:49.147 --> 35:50.606
I was trying to do the right thing.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.442
You weren't being honest, and I wanted
the skeletons out of the closet.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.652
You're fired, McAfee!

35:55.403 --> 35:56.279
Get out!

35:57.864 --> 35:58.906
[sobs]

35:59.323 --> 36:00.992
[quick retreating footsteps]

36:03.119 --> 36:04.912
[McAfee]
It was me. I sent the Speedo photo.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.081
-But why?
-I want to put Payton's campaign

36:07.165 --> 36:08.166
out of its misery.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.168
He's finished, probably for good,

36:10.251 --> 36:11.669
and I'm tired of working for someone

36:11.752 --> 36:13.129
who I know that I'm smarter than.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.007
Also, you were right.

36:16.507 --> 36:17.425
I'm ambitious,

36:17.508 --> 36:19.343
and you saw it the moment you met me.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.596
I did. And like then,

36:21.929 --> 36:23.306
I like your personal style.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.270
I don't care about a state senate seat.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.189
I want to go to Washington.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.149
That's where you and Dede are headed.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.567
I thought by handing you Payton,

36:34.650 --> 36:36.277
I would prove that I could be trusted.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.864
But this doesn't prove that at all.
How do I know you're not some mole?

36:39.947 --> 36:42.325
Because we already have a mole: Andrew.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.454
-[exhales sharply]
-You should get rid of him.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.999
-Those cats he gave you, they're bugged.
-[gasps]

36:50.082 --> 36:52.335
There's one at your house, one at Dede's.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.463
-[line rings, clicks]
-Sherry, get William on the phone.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.173
Okay, you're hired.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.717
No, Sherry, you do it.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.802
Because it's your job!

37:02.303 --> 37:03.971
Guess I'll find myself a desk.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.975
[office door opens, shuts]

37:10.645 --> 37:11.562
[clatters]

37:20.112 --> 37:21.280
[Andrew grunts softly]

37:23.908 --> 37:25.910
[overlapping chatter]

37:36.796 --> 37:37.672
[McAfee] It's done.

37:38.047 --> 37:38.965
I'm inside.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.259
Okay, good.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.054
That was really hard today,

37:45.304 --> 37:47.682
particularly because
I don't really understand

37:47.765 --> 37:48.808
what the plan is.

37:49.934 --> 37:50.851
Well...

37:51.519 --> 37:54.563
as soon as I saw that the twins had leaked
the yearbook photo,

37:55.356 --> 37:56.774
I knew we were in trouble.

37:57.149 --> 38:00.736
The campaign as I'd pictured it,
the one I wanted to run, that was over.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.239
We'd have to shake the whole thing up.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.702
We needed Dede and Hadassah

38:07.785 --> 38:09.161
-to see me as...
-[camera clicks]

38:10.329 --> 38:11.831
...fatally compromised,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.667
and I needed our campaign to...

38:14.917 --> 38:16.460
think exactly the same thing.

38:17.461 --> 38:21.382
So, you will confirm for them
that our campaign is a dumpster fire

38:22.341 --> 38:24.969
and that they've got
this whole thing wrapped up,

38:25.678 --> 38:28.222
just at the moment
when we've got our campaign's

38:28.306 --> 38:30.141
brightest political mind

38:30.224 --> 38:31.851
screwing them from the inside.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.979
We have two weeks. I'll start digging.

38:36.230 --> 38:39.275
Good.
Something big enough to take her down.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.403
You are our last play, McAfee.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.865
This is our Hail Mary.

38:47.158 --> 38:47.992
I'm on it.
