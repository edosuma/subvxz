00:06.000 --> 00:07.920
[ominous music plays]

00:53.080 --> 00:55.000
[monk] Send word to Father Carden.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.240
Tell him I've found the camp.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.560
Ride fast.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.400
Return with numbers. Go.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.880
[paladins] Yes, brother.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.640
[horses bray]

01:12.760 --> 01:15.200
[eerie ethereal music plays]

02:14.600 --> 02:16.320
Why wasn't I told about this?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.240
I thought it was your idea.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.360
They rode all night from Rue Gorge.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
In his condition?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.680
[Gawain] I do not like
him bringing outsiders here.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.200
Nimue.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.480
This is Druna.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.480
Druna's a smuggler.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.360
A pretty queen.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.720
[Arthur] Silks, spices,

02:40.680 --> 02:43.080
-and people.
-[Druna] There are three ships.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.040
Arrive in maybe six days.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.480
I can move your people.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.680
[Arthur] To Byzantium.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.880
What about the Fey still in hiding?
The other villages? We can't run now.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.200
We can't feed who we have.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.800
You have the sword.
We have seen what you can do with it.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.360
[Nimue] And it left me weakened, drained.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.480
My power has limits.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.080
[Arthur] There are Fey of ten clans here.
Think of what we could save.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.120
Their cultures. Languages.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.080
You could start over.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.040
We have no gold to pay you.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.600
[Druna]
The Red Paladins are thieves and liars.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.120
They play pure,
then they take bribes and steal my cargo.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.360
I'm happy to hurt them.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.960
You said six days?

03:26.320 --> 03:27.800
You are not considering this?

03:28.480 --> 03:30.440
I promised them I would protect them.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.000
I have to consider this.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.560
[tense music plays]

03:38.320 --> 03:39.840
[gasping breaths]

03:42.000 --> 03:43.160
[grunts]

03:45.520 --> 03:47.520
[Cora] There are still survivors
out there.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.320
Villages that need our protection.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.440
[Nimue] Cora, I know.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.680
But as it is,
we can't even feed who we have.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.440
Why are we to trust him?

03:56.040 --> 03:57.400
Because he's earned it.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.000
In blood.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.760
[girl] They're coming!

04:01.840 --> 04:03.440
-[Nimue] Who is?
-The Weeping Monk.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.440
Red Paladins. I don't know how many.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.720
They know where we are.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.080
-How far?
-A day's hike.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.080
-Maybe sooner.
-We need to fortify our defenses.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Fortify our...

04:13.240 --> 04:14.320
We can't stay here.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.920
-They'll smoke us out like rats.
-Can the ships come any sooner?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.360
They'll take longer, if anything.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.880
So we need at least six days' shelter.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.240
I need maps here!

04:25.320 --> 04:28.240
The first city beyond Moycraig...

04:28.680 --> 04:29.520
is Gramaire.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.560
Would your uncle help us?

04:31.640 --> 04:33.360
[scoffs] Not in the best of times.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.880
Besides, I was told that the Red Paladins
have taken Gramaire.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.040
-[Nimue] And your uncle?
-Let him rot.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.440
[Nimue] As long as
the paladins occupy Gramaire,

04:41.520 --> 04:44.600
they have endless food and supplies
to wage war on us in the hills.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.240
We'll never survive.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.120
So... we take it back.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.520
Take what back?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.160
Take Gramaire?

04:53.240 --> 04:55.000
Even a holding force, we'd be outnumbered.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.360
Four, five to one.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.840
An hour ago,
you were ready to take on the king's army.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.440
Yes, but this--

05:00.520 --> 05:02.720
We are out of food and space.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.560
Now we're out of time.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.480
We would only have to keep it
for six days.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.000
Time to rest.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.480
Recover.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.520
Resupply.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.000
Look, this is our only chance at survival.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.280
-They won't dare suspect it.
-[Gawain] Because...

05:22.480 --> 05:23.840
well, it's bloody mad.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.120
Have you thought about how to do this?

05:28.160 --> 05:29.720
They want the Wolf-Blood Witch.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.720
So let's give her to them.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.080
[Eydis] You have heard the truth
from Lady Cacher,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.320
the midwife who delivered the dead heir

05:43.400 --> 05:45.920
and paid in gold for the false king.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.240
Uther Pendragon

05:48.800 --> 05:51.400
is a fraud and a liar!

05:51.840 --> 05:53.360
Spread her words.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.200
Every man, woman, and child

05:57.280 --> 06:01.120
should know the rot
that lords on over from on high!

06:01.200 --> 06:02.080
False king!

06:02.160 --> 06:03.520
[man 2] Usurper!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.680
[exclamations of agreement]

06:06.320 --> 06:07.640
[man 3] False king!

06:09.880 --> 06:13.200
-[indistinct chattering]
-[Merlin] Cacher's testimony is spreading.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.800
Soon the militias will turn your way,

06:15.880 --> 06:18.480
softening the soil
all the way to Castle Pendragon.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.720
The midwife serves you well.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.760
She does.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.000
Now, what does she cost?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.240
The safety of one Fey girl.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.720
That's it?

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
That's it.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.040
Does this girl have a name?

06:33.880 --> 06:34.760
Nimue.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.280
Mm.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.280
What is she to you, Druid?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.280
To me?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.280
Not very much.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.120
It would be a promise kept.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.120
For a moment, I thought the dreaded Merlin
had a human heart after all.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
Don't you worry.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.760
I will consider your request.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.520
But for now, how's your appetite?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.640
I hear northern venison is superb.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.640
Watch him carefully, brother.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.840
What are they doing here?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.560
We have a guest from the south.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.960
I think we will all have much to discuss.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.840
Come.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.320
So, let us feast.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.560
[crows caw loudly]

07:35.920 --> 07:37.120
[door slams closed]

07:38.280 --> 07:41.000
Prior to your interference,

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
we had Merlin in check,

07:43.320 --> 07:46.000
the Sword of Power within our grasp,

07:46.080 --> 07:48.080
and now we have neither.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.280
Only this...

07:51.160 --> 07:52.800
nonsense... [chuckles]

07:52.880 --> 07:55.440
...of midwives and usurpers.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.720
There are mobs chanting this.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.800
Tell us this is just
one of Merlin's foolish parlor tricks.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.320
Tell us!

08:12.760 --> 08:14.600
I was never meant to raise children.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
You see,

08:17.280 --> 08:18.680
I was meant to rule.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.920
That was my talent.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.880
Queen Mother to all my subjects.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.360
But in this pathetic world of men
with their foolish bloodlines

08:28.440 --> 08:30.640
and antiquated rules,
that wasn't meant to be.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.160
I was relegated to make you king.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.000
And it would seem I've failed
in that one simple task.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.040
-Mother--
-But I'm not, you see.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.080
I am not your mother, Uther.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.320
I assure you,

08:44.760 --> 08:45.800
my true son

08:46.360 --> 08:48.160
would be made of finer steel.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.160
You are not the true king.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.800
I bought you.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.560
I claimed you as my own.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.360
I placed you on the seat of power.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
You have...

09:06.160 --> 09:07.160
ruined us.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.520
[Uther sobs gently]

09:13.080 --> 09:14.920
I may not be your mother, Uther,

09:15.720 --> 09:17.800
but I shall always be the Queen Mother.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.360
Now, you will do exactly as I say,

09:20.440 --> 09:23.400
and you will forge alliances
as I instruct,

09:23.480 --> 09:25.920
and only then will you weather this storm.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.360
Tear us down,

09:32.440 --> 09:33.720
and you will suffer

09:34.240 --> 09:35.480
as we suffer.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.000
I do not wish to be your enemy.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.640
Nor do I fear it.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.280
[Carden] My paladins cleansed these lands.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.640
I bring them to you as an offering.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.800
[Cumber coughs, laughs]

10:01.400 --> 10:03.520
[clicks tongue] Is this how it works here?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.000
The Church tells kings
which lands they own

10:06.080 --> 10:07.120
and what to do with them?

10:07.480 --> 10:09.640
A king guided by Rome

10:10.440 --> 10:12.120
has the power of God behind them.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.720
A king guided by Fey wisdom
as offered by a Druid

10:17.680 --> 10:19.200
suffers the fate of Uther.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.680
Now, I've got it.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.080
Your accent.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.800
That's the town of Dunrow talking,
isn't it, Carden?

10:31.280 --> 10:32.440
You have a good ear.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.440
[Merlin] Mm.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.040
Not exactly known for its bishops,
though, is it?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.200
Dunrow?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.320
I assume your father worked the mines?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.240
And his father before him.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.760
I had a different call.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.640
[chuckling] Ah! Get off it, Carden.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.720
You didn't see God in the Church.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.120
You saw an exit from that nothing town
you crawled out of.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.400
The clergy took you,

10:56.360 --> 10:57.640
but the Pope didn't.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.720
You couldn't buy your way in,

10:59.800 --> 11:02.840
so now you offer blood and ash.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.280
Your paladins have grown
and are feared throughout this land.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.960
And yet you remain here, instead of Rome.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.600
There speaks a man...

11:12.880 --> 11:14.840
with neither faith nor country.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
The Church and their Trinity Guard
have great power, my king.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.000
None of it is sitting here.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.960
[Carden] Merlin twists the truth

11:25.040 --> 11:28.200
to complicate a simple choice,
Your Highness.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.800
Are you for the Fey,

11:32.120 --> 11:33.840
or are you for the Church?

11:37.160 --> 11:38.600
I am for...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.720
myself, priest.

11:44.840 --> 11:45.720
No other.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.160
As it should be, Your Highness.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.440
But know...

11:54.120 --> 11:56.280
that in a few hours, at sunrise,

11:57.400 --> 11:59.560
the choice
will be taken out of your hands.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.200
The Lord's fire

12:02.840 --> 12:06.520
will purge the last remaining Fey
from existence.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.200
[tense music plays]

12:11.680 --> 12:13.600
[ominous music plays]

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
[monk] Advance.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.920
There's no one here!

12:30.960 --> 12:33.080
-[paladin 1] There's nothing.
-No one!

12:33.160 --> 12:34.160
There's nothing.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.200
Find them.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.360
Scour the wood.
They can't have gotten far.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.560
[paladin 2] There's no sign of them.
No one.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.720
Burn it all.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.480
Torch it!

12:48.240 --> 12:49.400
Torch it all!

12:59.920 --> 13:00.960
Brother.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.280
[mystical twinkling]

13:27.520 --> 13:29.120
[whispers] The Wolf-Blood Witch.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.920
The Wolf-Blood Witch!

13:31.680 --> 13:34.320
[shouts] The Wolf-Blood Witch! To arms!

13:35.360 --> 13:36.400
To arms!

13:36.480 --> 13:37.920
The witch is upon us!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.520
Assemble the guards!

13:39.600 --> 13:40.760
[paladin 1] Make ready!

13:40.840 --> 13:42.120
[commander] Come on!

13:45.000 --> 13:47.240
-Step aside! Out of the way!
-[horse brays]

13:48.000 --> 13:49.040
Make way there!

13:49.680 --> 13:51.840
Move! Move there!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.240
Clear the way!

13:55.920 --> 13:56.760
Move!

13:56.840 --> 13:58.400
Make way for the paladins!

13:58.480 --> 13:59.880
[tense music plays]

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
[horse brays]

14:07.680 --> 14:09.040
[paladins yell]

[breathes heavily]

32:23.800 --> 32:24.880
[horse brays]

32:28.720 --> 32:29.880
You wake us early.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.240
You march us to the middle of nowhere.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.240
For what?

32:34.400 --> 32:35.400
For whom.

32:39.320 --> 32:40.520
To beat a devil,

32:41.280 --> 32:43.040
you must make a deal with one.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.160
Milady, Regent.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.960
Your Majesty.

32:53.760 --> 32:54.760
It would seem...

32:57.560 --> 32:59.240
we have a mutual problem.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.280
The eldest returns.

33:09.880 --> 33:10.720
Tell.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.240
The midwife plays her part.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.520
The crowds believe her.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.720
The first villages fell in line with ease.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.640
And the others?

33:17.720 --> 33:21.720
On the road, by the time
we reached the fourth or fifth city,

33:22.200 --> 33:23.400
word had preceded us.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.440
But in the last two towns, something...

33:27.240 --> 33:28.200
troubling.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.240
Witchcraft troubles you?

33:40.320 --> 33:42.080
That's a person, Father.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.200
The symbol of the Wolf-Blood Witch,

33:45.280 --> 33:46.560
the new Fey Queen.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.280
She's called Nimue.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.240
Ah...

33:51.040 --> 33:52.360
Merlin's Fey girl.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.400
He wants her alive
and a friend to this court

33:57.480 --> 33:59.040
as payment for the midwife.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.960
[Eydis] Father,
she wields the Sword of Power.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.760
With it, she's taken the city of Gramaire
from the paladins.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.360
They say even humans now bow to her,
and call her--

34:08.440 --> 34:10.240
I am the king of this land,

34:10.880 --> 34:12.800
not some peasant witch!

34:13.920 --> 34:14.960
[Eydis] This girl,

34:15.960 --> 34:18.240
perhaps a few weeks ago,
she could have surrendered to you,

34:18.720 --> 34:20.120
been a ward of the court,

34:20.200 --> 34:21.360
the way the Red Spear--

34:21.440 --> 34:22.960
We don't speak of her!

34:25.800 --> 34:26.640
[sighs]

34:30.680 --> 34:32.440
[Eydis] I don't mean to upset you,

34:33.480 --> 34:36.280
but by possessing
the Sword of the First King,

34:36.640 --> 34:40.120
this Nimue makes a claim
to what is rightfully yours.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.680
She cannot be welcome here.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.320
She must be conquered.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.640
And the Sword of Power
should be wielded

34:49.720 --> 34:51.760
by you alone.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.840
[tense music plays]

35:06.960 --> 35:08.080
[door opening]

35:10.240 --> 35:12.480
[Ector] Ah! Here she is,

35:12.560 --> 35:14.560
the Queen of the Fey.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.360
Sorry to disturb you, my queen.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.640
This man demanded
that you come before him.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.080
Demanded?

35:25.480 --> 35:26.480
Lord Ector,

35:27.320 --> 35:29.120
I'm sorry we have not spoken sooner.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.760
I thank you for this sanctuary.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.880
Well, it was not offered, milady.

35:36.920 --> 35:37.920
It was taken.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.240
I had not finished.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.440
True, it was taken.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.640
But I assure you, until we leave here,
you are welcome as our guest...

35:44.720 --> 35:46.200
-Hmm.
-...in Gramaire.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.760
Once we have our safe passage,

35:48.840 --> 35:50.560
the town will be returned to you.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.800
But until then,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.520
you are in my seat.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.600
[Gawain] You heard her.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.320
[door opens]

36:12.040 --> 36:14.800
Did you devise this humiliation, Arthur?

36:14.880 --> 36:17.360
You will address our queen.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.600
[door closes]

36:24.240 --> 36:26.680
Gods, you're all just children.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.080
I have no argument with your kind

36:35.720 --> 36:37.600
and no love of Red Paladins,

36:37.680 --> 36:41.080
but do you truly think you're safe here?

36:41.160 --> 36:42.080
Hmm?

36:43.720 --> 36:44.760
Do any of you?

36:47.920 --> 36:51.440
You were safer in your caves and trees

36:51.520 --> 36:53.800
or wherever the hell you were hiding.

36:53.880 --> 36:54.880
We were starving.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.440
You'll starve here too,

36:56.520 --> 36:57.960
but only if you're lucky.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.640
You've doomed yourselves

37:04.600 --> 37:06.880
and all of Gramaire with you.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.800
I hope you're happy.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.960
Enjoy your brief reign...

37:20.160 --> 37:22.080
Queen of the Fey.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.360

[ethereal music plays]

37:47.280 --> 37:49.320
[reverential music]

38:07.800 --> 38:09.080
Can I sit on it?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.560
[slaps] Manners, boy.

38:10.640 --> 38:11.480
Ow!

38:14.080 --> 38:15.080
What news?

38:15.160 --> 38:18.000
In the light of the new day,
our count has come up short.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.680
We're missing a dozen Fey, maybe more.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.240
Some sick, some children.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.480
A convoy of refugees
that should have arrived hours ago.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.480
[Gawain] On their own,

38:28.560 --> 38:30.720
ripe targets for paladin patrols.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.920
Form a search party.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.360
With your permission,
I will join the hunt.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
May I go?

38:39.840 --> 38:42.080
If the Green Knight allows it.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.480
-Well...
-[door closes]

39:02.560 --> 39:03.840
...alone at last.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.040
It... it suits you.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.480
[chuckles] Don't be silly.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.600
I don't know what possessed me.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.520
Your uncle has a way
of getting under the skin.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.480
[Nimue groans]

39:23.960 --> 39:25.000
You're still weak.

39:25.960 --> 39:26.840
I know.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.520
It's all right.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.760
Your hand?

39:31.200 --> 39:32.600
It's... it's nothing.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.560
You're not all right.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.400
The sword could be making you sick.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
It's not.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.360
There is a cost to using this magic.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.240
-It's not just to your health, but to--
-To what?

39:45.200 --> 39:46.720
I'm ready to leave this place.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.520
As soon as Gawain returns,

39:48.600 --> 39:50.760
I must ride to Rue Gorge
and secure the ships.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.680
Must you?

39:56.600 --> 39:59.920
It's just... to have come this far,
only to run again.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.680
Nimue...

40:02.400 --> 40:05.000
just because we took Gramaire
doesn't mean we can hold it.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.240
The Church knows where you are now.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.440
The king knows where you are,
and they know you have the sword.

40:11.360 --> 40:14.200
-Don't be foolish.
-I've had enough lectures, Arthur!

40:18.040 --> 40:19.120
It is cruel

40:19.520 --> 40:21.800
to force these families onto ships.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.080
To another unknown fate
while invaders occupy their land.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.120
-Here, they have a roof over their heads.
-For how long?

40:31.120 --> 40:32.520
Have you been in a siege before?

40:33.480 --> 40:34.320
Have you?

40:36.080 --> 40:38.960
-Stop trying to pull rank on me, Arthur.
-That's impossible.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
You're the queen.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.640
Is it the title that bothers you?

40:46.320 --> 40:48.960
Or the fact that I took the throne
that you could not?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.720
What's the bloody point
in talking with you?

40:54.800 --> 40:57.120
-You'll do as you like.
-Arthur! Arthur!

40:57.840 --> 40:59.160

-[caws]

41:27.320 --> 41:28.920
[eerie whooshing]

41:29.000 --> 41:31.880
Whenever you arrive in this fashion,
it frightens even me.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.760
[Widow] A name has been given.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.640
Whose?

41:46.400 --> 41:48.320
[eerie whooshing]

41:51.760 --> 41:52.760
[under breath] No...

41:55.040 --> 41:57.120
You said Nimue couldn't be seen
by your visions.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.240
[Widow] This is no vision, Merlin.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.480
Her name has been given.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.320
And I am the Widow.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.040
You know I am unable
to refuse this summons.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.680
Just as you know her fate is now fixed.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.640
How much time?

42:21.280 --> 42:22.120
Days.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.680
Hours.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Not her.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.000
Please. Please, not her.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.960
I tell you this as a friend.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.440
Nothing can stop this.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.120
You're wrong!

42:49.280 --> 42:50.920
-[Merlin] Cumber!
-[guard] Halt!

42:51.280 --> 42:52.360
[Cumber] Let him in.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.640
[Eydis] You come
when not summoned, wizard.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.080
[Merlin] Lord Cumber.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.720
Our arrangement...

42:59.200 --> 43:01.360
The Fey girl will be safe here,
will she not?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, well, uh...

43:03.080 --> 43:04.880
only as a guest in my dungeons.

43:05.800 --> 43:09.080
It seems this Nimue is a bit more
than a simple Fey girl.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.400
Well, of course she is.
She wields the Sword of Power.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.000
A detail you neglected to share.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.320
Do you think me so foolish
as to wave the sword before your eyes?

43:17.400 --> 43:19.360
Knowing how it clouds the judgment?

43:20.080 --> 43:22.480
Do you think all my years
have taught me nothing?

43:24.360 --> 43:26.080
Those who chase the sword

43:26.800 --> 43:28.080
are doomed to obsession.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.760
But those who are patient,
who let the sword come to them,

43:30.840 --> 43:32.920
are the ones with the wisdom to wield it.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.240
Now, do you want to be the one true king,
or don't you?

43:36.600 --> 43:38.720
She presents as a rival to me, Merlin.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.880
That's unacceptable.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.400
Then your foolish northern pride
will cost you the greatest treasure

43:43.480 --> 43:44.600
of the ancient kings.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.760
We don't sweet-talk our enemies
in the Ice Realms.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.600
We crush them.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.160
Nimue doesn't seek to rule.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.600
She's no threat to you.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.680
Her followers are.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.480
They answer the midwife's charge

44:11.560 --> 44:13.680
with cries of "Fey Queen,"

44:14.240 --> 44:15.400
not "Cumber."

44:16.760 --> 44:18.880
I offer my dungeons to the Fey Queen

44:18.960 --> 44:22.200
as a gesture of thanks to you
for bringing me the midwife.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.040
You would be wise to accept it.

Born in the dawn, to pa--

46:31.120 --> 46:32.040
[thud]

46:35.920 --> 46:38.200
[monk] They want you alive, Green Knight.

46:38.600 --> 46:39.560
[Gawain grunts]

46:42.560 --> 46:43.560
[Gawain groans]

46:46.120 --> 46:47.720
[dramatic music plays]

46:52.800 --> 46:54.240
[mystical twinkling]

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
[faint pained screaming]

46:57.800 --> 46:59.040
[wind howls]

47:01.520 --> 47:03.480
[faint pained screaming]

47:04.440 --> 47:05.880
[mystical twinkling]

47:08.800 --> 47:10.520
[mystical twinkling]

47:13.200 --> 47:14.840
[faint pained screaming]

47:16.520 --> 47:18.160
[pained screaming]

47:18.240 --> 47:21.120
-[mystical twinkling]
-[pained screaming]

47:24.040 --> 47:24.920
[gasps]

47:28.080 --> 47:29.240
[door closes]

47:31.400 --> 47:32.240
I surrender.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.400
Scout party hasn't returned.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.480
We have to make sure
we don't miss our window with the ships.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.320
Do you think the Red Paladins have ghosts?

47:45.040 --> 47:47.000
Do you think their spirits live on?

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
I suppose.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.600
If any of us do.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.400
Why?

47:54.240 --> 47:55.360
[mystical twinkling]

47:56.480 --> 47:57.480
[Nimue] I...

47:58.800 --> 47:59.840
I hear them.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.600
In the sword.

48:05.400 --> 48:06.480
I hear their screams.

48:07.040 --> 48:07.880
You're tired.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.920
What frightens me is
I don't mind the screams.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.120
They comfort me.

48:16.600 --> 48:17.920
Why don't you put it down?

48:20.080 --> 48:22.120
-I'm fine.
-You don't sound fine.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.360
[Nimue] Why do you want me to put it down?

48:25.160 --> 48:27.440
Is it the same reason
you want me to run away?

48:27.960 --> 48:30.200
-To give up?
-Those ships are your only hope.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.440
You've never believed in me.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.400
[scoffs]

48:33.840 --> 48:35.560
I was the first to believe in you.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.480
That's a lie.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.600
You think I'm helpless

48:39.080 --> 48:40.080
or mad,

48:40.600 --> 48:41.880
but what is real?

48:42.400 --> 48:44.520
Well, the Fey occupy Gramaire.

48:46.360 --> 48:49.800
And dead paladins litter the road
from here to Hawksbridge, thanks to me!

48:49.880 --> 48:51.960
-You want to keep fighting?
-Yes. Why not?

48:52.040 --> 48:53.640
-Nimue!
-I am the Wolf-Blood Witch,

48:53.720 --> 48:57.040
and I will slaughter every Red Brother
from here to Rome if I must!

48:57.120 --> 48:58.320
[Nimue breathes heavily]

49:01.520 --> 49:04.080
Is that you talking or the sword?

49:04.520 --> 49:05.600
I can't tell anymore.

49:06.840 --> 49:09.280
Because the difference is
the sword can survive the next battle,

49:09.360 --> 49:10.200
we cannot.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.280
But I won't leave you.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.160
If this is where we make our last stand,
so be it.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.120
No.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.160
No.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.280
No, I'm sorry.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.360
[inhales shakily, sighs]

49:28.440 --> 49:29.880
I'm not feeling myself.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.520
[breathes shakily]

49:33.640 --> 49:34.680
[door opens]

49:36.760 --> 49:37.840
Secure the ships.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.400
[man] No ships.

49:41.360 --> 49:42.240
This...

49:43.240 --> 49:45.160
was thrown over the walls.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.040
They found your smuggler.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.240
[Fey guard] Milady. Milady, Nimue!

49:53.280 --> 49:54.440
[mystical twinkling]

50:01.240 --> 50:02.080
Kaze.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.680
We were ambushed.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.880
Are you all right?

50:04.960 --> 50:06.880
It was the monk. He took Gawain alive.

50:07.600 --> 50:08.640
[lookout] Armies!

50:09.240 --> 50:10.840
Armies approaching!

50:11.320 --> 50:14.240
-[murmuring]
-[lookout] Movement in the tree line.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.280
[man 1] Everyone, get your weapons!

50:16.800 --> 50:18.080
[man 2] To your stations!

50:18.600 --> 50:20.560
[ominous music plays]

50:20.640 --> 50:23.320
[man 2] Close the gate! Close the gate!

50:24.920 --> 50:26.360
[distant yelling]

50:26.440 --> 50:28.440
[marching footsteps approach]

50:30.200 --> 50:31.440
[distant yelling]

50:42.560 --> 50:44.360
[breathes heavily]

50:48.480 --> 50:50.480
