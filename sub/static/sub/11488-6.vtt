WEBVTT

00:01.842 --> 00:03.341
Here we are.

00:03.408 --> 00:04.542
Be it ever so humble.

00:04.608 --> 00:07.241
Wow, this is some house.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.142
If you ever decide to sell,
I want the listing.

00:10.208 --> 00:12.742
Well, you'd have to kill
my mom for it, so...

00:12.809 --> 00:14.842
sure.

00:17.009 --> 00:18.442
Can I make you a drink?

00:18.508 --> 00:20.875
Charlie, we both know
I'm gonna sleep with you.

00:20.942 --> 00:24.142
You don't have
to liquor me up.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.842
Hey, I've been doing
this a long time.

00:25.909 --> 00:27.308
Trust me,
you'll want a drink.

00:29.475 --> 00:31.109
Oh, hey.

00:31.176 --> 00:32.341
I didn't know
you guys were home.

00:32.408 --> 00:33.975
Lydia, this is
my brother Alan.

00:34.042 --> 00:35.241
Alan, hi.

00:35.308 --> 00:36.341
Hi.

00:36.408 --> 00:38.642
So sorry to hear
about your troubles.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.109
Troubles?
What troubles?

00:40.176 --> 00:41.508
Oh, maybe I have it wrong.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.608
Charlie, didn't you
tell me he was divorced,

00:43.675 --> 00:45.341
broke and living
on your couch?

00:49.975 --> 00:52.942
I don't know what
she's talking about.

00:53.009 --> 00:55.208
Well, I am going through
a bit of a rough patch,

00:55.275 --> 00:57.275
but I try not to think
about it too much.

00:57.341 --> 00:58.975
Good for you.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.142
I'd be suicidal.

01:02.442 --> 01:04.641
You hear that?
You have options.

01:05.842 --> 01:08.575
Anyway, this is
my nephew Jake.

01:08.642 --> 01:09.842
Hello, Jake.
Hi.

01:09.909 --> 01:11.076
So, what grade
are you in?

01:11.142 --> 01:12.675
Seventh.

01:12.742 --> 01:15.208
Well, don't you worry
when the other kids
make fun of you.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.642
You'll show 'em someday.

01:17.709 --> 01:20.308
Nobody makes fun of me.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.475
You're kidding?

01:22.542 --> 01:24.875
Why would anyone make fun of me?

01:24.942 --> 01:27.809
And this is
my housekeeper Berta.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.009
Berta, Lydia.

01:29.076 --> 01:32.176
Choose your words carefully,
Slim.

01:32.241 --> 01:34.042
Slim?

01:34.109 --> 01:35.375
Why, thank you.

01:35.442 --> 01:36.975
I watch what I eat.

01:37.042 --> 01:39.875
Going in or coming out?

01:46.142 --> 01:49.208
Hey, why don't we forget
the drinks, and go out

01:49.275 --> 01:50.909
on the deck
and enjoy the sunset?

01:50.975 --> 01:54.208
All right. Well, it was so
nice to meet all of you.

01:54.275 --> 01:56.208
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Sure.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.742
You didn't have to be so rude.

02:03.975 --> 02:07.375
<i>You said they were
laughing with me.</i>

02:07.442 --> 02:11.109

02:37.843 --> 02:40.710
Oh, Charlie...

02:40.777 --> 02:44.110
No need to thank me.

02:44.176 --> 02:47.710
I wasn't going to.

02:47.777 --> 02:49.276
Excuse me?

02:49.343 --> 02:51.144
I mean, it was very nice,

02:51.209 --> 02:53.410
it's just if I'd known you
were gonna camp down there

02:53.476 --> 02:55.877
I would've given you a lantern
and some marshmallows.

02:58.376 --> 03:00.077
Hey, I was just
trying to be thorough.

03:00.144 --> 03:01.543
You were showing off.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.376
No, no, if I were
showing off

03:03.443 --> 03:05.877
I'd have done it
with no hands.

03:05.943 --> 03:08.376
So I can expect
this kind of effort

03:08.443 --> 03:09.943
every time we get in bed?

03:10.010 --> 03:14.044
Well, maybe not
during flu season.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.044
And it's important
to have variety.

03:16.110 --> 03:18.376
I'm not always gonna
swing for the long ball,

03:18.443 --> 03:20.543
every once in a while
I'll lay down a bunt,

03:20.610 --> 03:23.843
and how did you manage to
turn this into a bad thing?

03:23.910 --> 03:26.010
It's not a bad thing.

03:26.077 --> 03:27.943
Thank you.

03:28.010 --> 03:30.443
Which is not to say if you
were open to suggestion

03:30.510 --> 03:31.543
it couldn't be better.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.677
Oh, really?

03:32.743 --> 03:34.110
And how could it
have been better?

03:34.176 --> 03:37.144
Ooh, looks like
I pushed a button.

03:37.209 --> 03:39.843
Yeah, well, it looks
like I didn't.

03:39.910 --> 03:42.144
Charlie...

03:42.209 --> 03:45.209
you can push an elevator
button a hundred times,

03:45.276 --> 03:48.943
it still won't
come any faster.

03:50.144 --> 03:51.410
Fine.

03:51.476 --> 03:53.276
Maybe next time
I'll take the stairs.

03:53.343 --> 03:56.144
Oh, come on...

03:56.209 --> 03:59.576
don't be like that.

03:59.643 --> 04:02.843
You were magnificent.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.376
Astonishing.

04:05.443 --> 04:09.343
You've ruined me
for other men.

04:09.410 --> 04:12.276
There, was that so hard?

04:12.343 --> 04:15.243
You boys and
your little egos.

04:15.309 --> 04:16.410
Okay, okay, stop.

04:16.476 --> 04:18.209
In this bed,
we don't say "boys"

04:18.276 --> 04:19.442
and we don't say
"little."

04:19.510 --> 04:22.144
Fine.

04:22.209 --> 04:23.777
You want me
to try again?

04:23.843 --> 04:26.877
No, I'm a bit chafed.

04:26.943 --> 04:29.343
Let's make the next few
minutes about pleasing you.

04:29.410 --> 04:31.977
A few minutes?
That's all I get?

04:32.044 --> 04:33.144
Trust me, darling,

04:33.209 --> 04:35.710
with me, that's all
you can handle.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.376
* Men... *

04:40.443 --> 04:42.610
(TV playing)

04:42.677 --> 04:44.476
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?

04:44.543 --> 04:46.643
Do you like Uncle
Charlie's new girlfriend?

04:46.710 --> 04:49.843
Well, I just met her
the one time, so...

04:49.910 --> 04:51.810
no, not really.

04:51.877 --> 04:53.877
You know who she
reminds me of?

04:53.943 --> 04:56.209
The girls at school who
think they rule the world

04:56.276 --> 04:58.710
just 'cause they
got their boobs.

04:58.777 --> 05:01.376
Well, I hate to tell you, buddy,

05:01.443 --> 05:04.010
but they kinda do.

05:04.077 --> 05:05.443
I don't get it.

05:05.510 --> 05:07.677
I wouldn't be mean
if I had boobs.

05:07.743 --> 05:09.543
That's very admirable.

05:22.144 --> 05:23.243
(girly voice):
Hi there.

05:23.309 --> 05:26.677
I like you very much.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.877
Please don't do that.

05:28.943 --> 05:32.510
Do what?
I'm just being nice.

05:32.576 --> 05:34.476
I'm serious.
Cut it out.

05:36.176 --> 05:37.176
Hey.

05:37.243 --> 05:38.410
Hey.

05:38.476 --> 05:42.110
(girly voice):
Hello, big boy.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.877
You really need to get him
into a sport.

05:48.476 --> 05:52.010
I'll need
a sports bra.

05:52.077 --> 05:55.276
I said quit it.

05:55.343 --> 05:57.044
What are you watching?

05:57.110 --> 05:59.276
I don't know,
some Disney crap.

06:01.209 --> 06:02.677
Where's your
girlfriend?

06:02.743 --> 06:05.476
Hey, my boob!

06:07.376 --> 06:09.276
She had to go
pick up her kids.

06:09.343 --> 06:11.843
Probably from therapy.

06:11.910 --> 06:13.077
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:13.144 --> 06:14.110
We don't like her.

06:14.176 --> 06:15.977
Who's "we"?

06:16.044 --> 06:17.276
Me and Dad.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.743
No, no, I d... uh...

06:19.810 --> 06:21.044
That's, that's not...

06:21.110 --> 06:23.510
I mean, she
seems really...

06:23.576 --> 06:25.443
No, we don't
like her.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.543
All right, she might be
a bit outspoken,

06:28.610 --> 06:30.576
but I happen to find
that very attractive.

06:30.643 --> 06:34.810
She must be dynamite
in the sack.

06:37.443 --> 06:38.943
Where do you get
this stuff from?

06:39.010 --> 06:41.943
Cinemax.

06:42.010 --> 06:46.144
Well, not that my sex life
is any of your business...

06:46.209 --> 06:47.343
It's not
his business.

06:47.410 --> 06:48.943
It's nobody's
business.

06:49.010 --> 06:51.510
So, what does she do
for a living?

06:51.576 --> 06:55.510
Besides being a
stone cold bee-yatch.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.977
HBO.

07:03.176 --> 07:04.943
She sells real estate.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.110
Oh, like Mom.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.910
No, not like Mom.

07:09.977 --> 07:12.743
Lydia sells high-end homes
in Beverly Hills,

07:12.810 --> 07:14.910
and Mom sells
high-end homes...

07:14.977 --> 07:16.543
mostly on the beach.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.910
What are you getting
so defensive about?

07:18.977 --> 07:20.309
I'm not getting defensive!

07:20.376 --> 07:24.044
Lydia sells homes
on the bee-yatch.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.910
All right, all right, that's it.
Go to bed.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.943
I wasn't mean
before I got my boobs.

07:44.977 --> 07:49.010
Boy, puberty is gonna
hit him like a shovel.

07:50.543 --> 07:52.376
* Men... *

07:54.843 --> 07:57.010
Good to have you back,
Mr. Harper.
Thank you, Bobby.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.376
We haven't seen your mother here
for quite some time.

07:59.443 --> 08:01.077
Well, maybe you just didn't
recognize her.

08:01.144 --> 08:03.710
Like Satan, my mother
can take many forms.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.910
(chuckles):
Good one.

08:05.977 --> 08:07.943
I'm ready to order.

08:08.010 --> 08:09.110
Of course.

08:09.176 --> 08:11.110
Apologies for the frivolity.

08:11.176 --> 08:13.044
What would you like?

08:13.110 --> 08:14.910
I'll have the seared
ahi tuna filet.

08:14.977 --> 08:16.643
Good choice.
I want it
very rare.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.343
That's how we serve it.
I want it red in the
middle, not pink.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.910
Shall do.
If it's pink, don't even
bother bringing it.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.044
Got it.
Just give it to someone who
doesn't know what rare is.

08:24.110 --> 08:25.643
Of course.
You know what?
Forget it.

08:25.710 --> 08:28.243
You won't
get it right.

08:28.309 --> 08:29.443
Is your salmon fresh?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.110
Flown in today.

08:31.176 --> 08:32.044
What time?

08:32.110 --> 08:34.077
I'll ask the chef.

08:34.144 --> 08:37.243
Many forms.
I thought you were joking.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.576
You eat here regularly?

08:40.643 --> 08:42.710
Not anymore.

08:42.777 --> 08:44.743
So, listen,
about this weekend.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.743
My ex is going
to be out of town,

08:46.810 --> 08:48.176
so I'll have the kids.

08:48.243 --> 08:50.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lydia,
no one loves the little ones

08:50.877 --> 08:52.743
more than old Uncle Charlie,

08:52.810 --> 08:55.077
but don't you think
it might be a bit soon

08:55.144 --> 08:56.343
for me to meet your kids?

08:56.410 --> 08:58.443
Oh, I don't want
you to meet them.

08:58.510 --> 08:59.443
Why not?

08:59.510 --> 09:00.510
Because I'm very careful

09:00.576 --> 09:01.910
about who I expose them to.

09:01.977 --> 09:03.810
What's that supposed to mean?
Charlie, please.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.543
Why can't I expose myself
to your kids?

09:06.610 --> 09:09.243
I mean, why can't I meet
your kids?

09:09.309 --> 09:11.677
Please don't make me
hurt your feelings.

09:11.743 --> 09:13.743
You can't hurt my feelings.

09:13.810 --> 09:16.276
All right, fine.

09:16.343 --> 09:18.077
You're a professional boy toy,

09:18.144 --> 09:20.677
a perpetual adolescent
leading a dissolute life.

09:20.743 --> 09:22.309
You may have your uses,

09:22.376 --> 09:25.243
but you're not the kind of man
I want around my children.

09:25.309 --> 09:27.276
Oh.

09:27.343 --> 09:30.476
What made you think that would
hurt my feelings?

09:30.543 --> 09:32.044
2:00.
Jet Blue from Vancouver.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.443
Would you like me to find out
what the movie was?

09:34.510 --> 09:37.176
Don't bother,
I'll just have the capellini.

09:38.543 --> 09:41.543
And I'll have the pork chop
with a baked potato.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.443
How about a little angioplasty
for dessert?

09:44.510 --> 09:46.510
Hey, I like a nice pork chop
once in a while.

09:46.576 --> 09:48.777
Fine, I'm not going
to tell you how to eat.

09:48.843 --> 09:50.077
Really?

09:50.144 --> 09:52.144
Even if I chew slowly
for your pleasure?

09:53.977 --> 09:55.077
(waiter clears throat)

09:55.144 --> 09:58.777
So, yay or nay
on the pork chop?

09:58.843 --> 10:03.010
I'll have the spinach
and goat cheese salad.

10:03.077 --> 10:04.376
Good choice.
Thank you.

10:04.443 --> 10:05.677
<i>On the food.</i>

10:08.209 --> 10:10.376
* Men... *

10:12.576 --> 10:15.144
How many pieces of bacon
are you going to eat?

10:15.209 --> 10:16.810
My record's 14.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.643
I barfed, but
it still counts.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.743
Do you know
what's going to happen

10:21.810 --> 10:23.643
if you continue
to eat like this?

10:23.710 --> 10:26.877
Yeah, I'm gonna barf.

10:28.110 --> 10:29.677
Alan, doesn't
this poor child

10:29.743 --> 10:31.543
already have enough
strikes against him?

10:31.610 --> 10:33.243
He's fine, Mom.

10:33.309 --> 10:35.543
All right, but when
Jerry Springer has
to knock down a wall

10:35.610 --> 10:37.343
just to get him
out of his house,

10:37.410 --> 10:39.677
don't come
crying to me.

10:39.743 --> 10:42.710
That wasn't Jerry,
that was Dr. Phil.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.543
I'm not saying
it wasn't a turn-on,

10:45.610 --> 10:47.677
I just think you need
to trim a fingernail.

10:47.743 --> 10:49.677
Oh.
Hey, Mom.

10:49.743 --> 10:52.843
Uh, Mom, this is Lydia.
Lydia, my mother.

10:52.910 --> 10:54.743
Oh, pleased to meet you.

10:54.810 --> 10:56.910
Likewise.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.200
Boy, I'm glad I stopped
coming to work high.

11:07.507 --> 11:08.535
SO,lydia

11:08.946 --> 11:09.483
what you do?

11:10.005 --> 11:12.539
I mean, besides my son.

11:14.639 --> 11:15.906
I'm in real estate.

11:15.973 --> 11:18.606
How interesting, so am I.

11:18.672 --> 11:20.839
Oh, yes. Evelyn Harper.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.739
I recognize you
from your bus bench ads.

11:23.806 --> 11:27.005
People all over town
are sitting on your face.

11:29.839 --> 11:32.005
Well, dear, maybe someday,

11:32.072 --> 11:34.005
if you work hard,
people will be sitting

11:34.072 --> 11:35.906
on your face, too.

11:38.272 --> 11:40.372
Thank you. Although when I get
to be your age,

11:40.439 --> 11:42.472
I hope I won't be schlepping
to open houses

11:42.539 --> 11:43.906
in order to make a buck.

11:43.973 --> 11:45.672
(chuckles)
Don't say "schlep," darling.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.739
You're a bit too vanilla
to pull it off.

11:49.806 --> 11:51.439
So, Charlie,
how long have you

11:51.506 --> 11:53.606
been seeing this
lovely woman?

11:53.672 --> 11:57.339
Uh... how long has
it been, sweetie?

11:57.405 --> 11:59.305
Are you telling me you
don't remember when we met?

11:59.372 --> 12:01.138
The way
he drinks?

12:01.205 --> 12:04.405
There's a good chance he doesn't
remember coming down the stairs.

12:04.472 --> 12:05.806
Did his father drink?

12:05.873 --> 12:08.939
What choice did he have?

12:09.005 --> 12:10.772
Charlie, don't be snide.

12:10.839 --> 12:13.272
And stand up straight.

12:14.839 --> 12:16.672
This is so weird.

12:16.739 --> 12:18.305
EVELYN:
Well, I really must run.

12:18.372 --> 12:20.906
Oh, me, too--
can I walk you out?
Oh, how nice.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.572
Are you sure you don't
want to stay

12:22.639 --> 12:24.806
and finish putting on
your makeup?

12:24.873 --> 12:27.172
That's okay, I'm done.

12:27.239 --> 12:28.873
Would you like
to borrow some?

12:28.939 --> 12:31.372
No, thanks, I'm allergic
to the drugstore brands.

12:42.405 --> 12:44.138
What?

12:45.172 --> 12:48.172
<i>And they call you slow.</i>

12:48.239 --> 12:49.772
You're kidding,
right?

12:49.839 --> 12:51.138
You don't see it?

12:51.205 --> 12:52.138
See what?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.439
Lydia and Mom.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.572
What about them?

12:54.639 --> 12:56.205
Come on, Charlie.
The only difference

12:56.272 --> 12:59.706
between those two broads
is you came out of
one and you're...

12:59.772 --> 13:00.739
CHARLIE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:00.806 --> 13:02.906
Hold on, hold on.

13:08.539 --> 13:10.873
You think Lydia's like Mom?

13:10.939 --> 13:13.339
No. We think
Lydia is Mom.

13:13.405 --> 13:17.405
Okay, okay, you guys are nuts.

13:17.472 --> 13:20.239
And this conversation
is over.

13:22.038 --> 13:24.439
Who calls me slow?

13:26.939 --> 13:29.205
* Men... *

13:29.272 --> 13:31.138
And I'll tell you another thing.

13:31.205 --> 13:33.873
There's a lot of women in this
town who work in real estate.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.672
I thought this
conversation was over.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.873
They all wear the suits
and the designer bags.

13:37.939 --> 13:39.105
It's like a uniform.

13:39.172 --> 13:41.439
They could be firemen.

13:41.506 --> 13:43.839
And Mom's Lexus is a two-door,

13:43.906 --> 13:45.839
while Lydia's Lexus
is a four-door.

13:45.906 --> 13:47.072
Worlds apart.

13:47.138 --> 13:48.839
It is worlds apart.

13:48.906 --> 13:50.806
The two-door is a selfish car.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.973
The four-door is a family car.

13:53.038 --> 13:54.873
And you know why Lydia
has a family car?

13:54.939 --> 13:56.372
Because Lydia has children.

13:56.439 --> 13:58.939
Unlike our mother.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.339
Shut up.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.372
Charlie, it's okay.

14:03.439 --> 14:05.372
You've been working out
your maternal issues

14:05.439 --> 14:07.339
by having sex with other women
your entire life.

14:07.405 --> 14:09.939
All you're doing now
is cutting out the middle man.

14:10.005 --> 14:12.439
Oh, that is just sick.

14:13.939 --> 14:16.706
My point exactly.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.873
(muttering):
Stupid idiot.

14:20.439 --> 14:22.572
You're just jealous.

14:22.639 --> 14:28.105
Lydia's smart, funny, and sexy,
way sexier than Mom.

14:28.172 --> 14:29.739
Not that I think Mom is sexy.

14:29.806 --> 14:32.739
New thought, new thought,
new thought.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.472
Oh, Charlie.

14:34.539 --> 14:37.105
If you could get
rid of disturbing
thoughts that easily,

14:37.172 --> 14:40.906
I wouldn't be making a quilt
out of your old underwear.

14:40.973 --> 14:43.305
Hi, Rose.

14:43.372 --> 14:46.105
I brought you
a little gift.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.072
<i>OedipusRex?</i>

14:48.138 --> 14:50.105
It's about a guy who
sleeps with his mother

14:50.172 --> 14:51.472
and then pokes
his eyes out.

14:51.539 --> 14:52.772
I'm giving away
the ending,

14:52.839 --> 14:54.138
because I'm afraid
you might be blind

14:54.205 --> 14:56.138
by the time
you get to it.

14:56.205 --> 14:57.539
Where do you get this stuff?

14:57.606 --> 14:59.072
You've never even seen Lydia.

14:59.138 --> 15:02.105
No, you've never
seen me see her.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.739
Lydia is nothing like my mother.

15:04.806 --> 15:06.472
Why would I get involved
with a woman

15:06.539 --> 15:08.772
who even slightly resembles
the monster who bore me?

15:08.839 --> 15:13.138
(chuckling):
Oh, are you going
to love this book.

15:14.172 --> 15:15.839
(sighing):
Here.

15:15.906 --> 15:17.606
Mom wants to talk to you.

15:17.672 --> 15:19.472
Oh, great.

15:19.539 --> 15:20.939
Hi, Mom.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.806
Oh, Lydia.

15:22.873 --> 15:24.138
(softly):
Very funny.

15:24.205 --> 15:25.572
I thought so.

15:25.639 --> 15:27.772
I liked it.
(chuckles)

15:27.839 --> 15:29.405
So what's up?

15:29.472 --> 15:30.939
Are you still
coming over tomorrow?

15:31.005 --> 15:33.806
I thought your ex
had the kids.

15:33.873 --> 15:37.305
Okay, well, why don't you
bring them over?

15:37.372 --> 15:40.973
Oh, please, how could I possibly
embarrass you?

15:41.038 --> 15:44.239
No, no, no, no, no, no, I
only do that when I'm drunk.

15:46.038 --> 15:49.639
Look, I swear, I'll be
on my best behavior.

15:49.706 --> 15:52.239
Great. I'll see you then,
Mom...

15:52.305 --> 15:53.739
of the year!

15:55.072 --> 15:57.172
Well, in my book you are.

15:58.806 --> 16:01.572
One word, and everybody
gets their eyes poked out.

16:03.272 --> 16:05.439
* Men... *

16:05.506 --> 16:08.205
Why do I have to play
with kids I don't know?

16:08.272 --> 16:10.038
Because Lydia's
bringing them over,

16:10.105 --> 16:13.906
and I didn't have time
to rent a clown.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.539
Are they boys or girls?

16:15.606 --> 16:17.372
Beats me.

16:17.439 --> 16:18.772
How old are they?

16:18.839 --> 16:20.272
Not a clue.

16:20.339 --> 16:22.506
Sounds like fun.

16:22.572 --> 16:24.038
Hey, they're kids,
you're a kid.

16:24.105 --> 16:25.439
How tough could it be?

16:25.506 --> 16:28.405
I mean, we're not
breeding pandas here.

16:29.506 --> 16:31.873
All right, but
if they're boys,

16:31.939 --> 16:33.572
just don't call them
"little dudes," okay?

16:33.639 --> 16:34.939
Why not?

16:35.005 --> 16:36.639
There was this guy
Mom used to date,

16:36.706 --> 16:39.038
and every time he'd see me,
he'd call me "little dude."

16:39.105 --> 16:40.873
He was an idiot.

16:41.973 --> 16:44.339
Okay, okay,
that's good stuff.

16:44.405 --> 16:45.572
What else you got?

16:45.639 --> 16:47.038
No lame magic tricks,
no head rubbing,

16:47.105 --> 16:48.772
and please,
no high fives.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.172
Got it.

16:50.239 --> 16:52.138
And don't ask,
"Who wants ice cream?"

16:52.205 --> 16:54.038
Everybody wants ice cream.

16:54.105 --> 16:55.339
I understand.

16:55.405 --> 16:58.172
Even lactose-intolerant kids
want ice cream.

16:58.239 --> 16:59.772
Makes sense.

16:59.839 --> 17:01.506
But whatever you do, don't try
to pretend you're

17:01.572 --> 17:03.572
not sleeping with their mom.
We're not stupid.

17:04.906 --> 17:07.539
So if I do this stuff,
her kids will like me?

17:07.606 --> 17:09.239
No.
Why not?

17:09.305 --> 17:11.038
You're doing their mom.

17:13.606 --> 17:15.439
(doorbell rings)

17:17.739 --> 17:19.038
Hello, Lydia.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.204
Hey, little dudes,
give me five.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.005
(chuckling):
All right.

17:26.071 --> 17:27.873
That's what I'm
talking about.

17:27.939 --> 17:32.038
(softly):
Don't worry,
he's not the one I'm dating.

17:32.105 --> 17:34.439
There they are. Welcome.

17:34.506 --> 17:35.672
Hello, Charlie.

17:35.739 --> 17:37.439
These are my sons,
Andy and Joey.

17:37.506 --> 17:38.472
Nice to meet you guys.

17:38.539 --> 17:39.739
(coughing):
Wrong.

17:43.372 --> 17:45.405
Shake hands with him, darlings.

17:45.472 --> 17:46.772
Hi.

17:46.839 --> 17:47.873
Hey.

17:47.939 --> 17:49.005
(scoffs)
Not like that.

17:49.072 --> 17:50.806
Shake hands
like a man.
I am!

17:51.939 --> 17:53.772
Do you always
have to embarrass me?

17:53.839 --> 17:55.606
(laughs)

17:55.672 --> 17:56.672
What are you laughing at?

17:56.739 --> 17:58.772
You're no prize, either.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.105
Oh.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.239
What?

18:10.305 --> 18:12.172
Nothing.

18:12.239 --> 18:13.772
Excuse me.

18:30.706 --> 18:34.372
(Charlie screaming)

18:40.506 --> 18:44.539
Hey, who wants
ice cream?

18:50.156 --> 18:51.590
Sorbet, not ice cream.

18:52.018 --> 18:55.484
You don't want to turn into a
big tub of goo like your father.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.951
And those are
expensive new shirts.

18:58.018 --> 19:01.351
If you stain them,
don't even bother coming back.

19:08.317 --> 19:10.085
What now?

19:10.152 --> 19:12.218
Oh. Nothing, nothing.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.785
I was just thinking
about mothers

19:14.851 --> 19:19.918
and kids and crying.

19:19.985 --> 19:23.252
So much crying.

19:23.317 --> 19:25.851
Well, what do you think
of my boys?

19:25.918 --> 19:27.651
Oh, they're-they're terrific.

19:27.718 --> 19:32.384
And the way you interact
with them is so... unbelievable.

19:32.451 --> 19:33.985
Thank you.

19:34.051 --> 19:35.918
The older one has a chance.

19:35.985 --> 19:38.118
The younger one, I'm afraid,
is a lost cause.

19:39.951 --> 19:41.085
Anyway,

19:41.152 --> 19:43.085
we have the house
to ourselves.

19:43.152 --> 19:45.951
Do you feel
like going upstairs?

19:46.018 --> 19:50.218
Uh, yeah, that's a, uh,
interesting idea.

19:50.284 --> 19:52.218
What's the matter, Charlie?

19:52.284 --> 19:54.718
It's kind of
hard to explain.

19:54.785 --> 19:57.851
Well, why don't we
go get naked

19:57.918 --> 20:00.885
and see if that
loosens your tongue?

20:03.417 --> 20:07.484
I got my nails done.

20:11.284 --> 20:12.584
Oh, why not?

20:12.651 --> 20:15.185
I'm going to hell, anyway.
