WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:04.041
(  mellow theme playing  )

00:19.458 --> 00:20.625
Now then, Dither...

00:20.667 --> 00:23.166
let's test your new

00:20.667 --> 00:23.166
central processor.

00:23.208 --> 00:25.083
Initiate toast protocol.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.458
Toast? Toast?

00:27.500 --> 00:28.709
To-o-oast!

00:28.750 --> 00:29.959
( glass breaking )

00:30.000 --> 00:31.458
( Dither crashing )

00:31.500 --> 00:34.750
Daddy, are you experimenting

00:31.500 --> 00:34.750
before breakfast again?

00:34.792 --> 00:36.000
( gasping)

00:34.792 --> 00:36.000
Whoa!

00:36.041 --> 00:37.458
Toast? Toast?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.834
Toast?

00:38.875 --> 00:40.083
Toast?

00:40.125 --> 00:42.083
( grunting )

00:40.125 --> 00:42.083
Dither... Put that back!

00:42.125 --> 00:46.291
Nobody...wants...any...toast!

00:46.333 --> 00:47.959
It's all right, Frankie.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.041
Dither's just testing

00:48.000 --> 00:50.041
his new bioelectric chip.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.333
( grunting )

00:52.500 --> 00:53.750
( glass breaking )

00:53.792 --> 00:55.291
Toast!

00:55.333 --> 00:57.875
And I think it just

00:55.333 --> 00:57.875
failed the test!

00:57.917 --> 00:59.458
Better call the Chief.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.834
Toast? Toast?

01:07.875 --> 01:09.166
Toast?

01:09.208 --> 01:11.041
( tires screeching )

01:13.166 --> 01:15.458
Better get to safety, Mayor.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.583
PoliceBot, go around back.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.583
I'll flush him out.

01:20.583 --> 01:21.834
Toast?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.417
Ow!

01:26.458 --> 01:29.792
Team, Dad needs backup.

01:26.458 --> 01:29.792
Dither's on a toaster binge!

01:29.834 --> 01:32.667
Looks like he's headed

01:29.834 --> 01:32.667
out of town.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.667
We're on it.

01:32.709 --> 01:34.250
At least nobody

01:32.709 --> 01:34.250
lives out there.

01:34.291 --> 01:36.375
Actually, there is one person...

01:38.834 --> 01:40.917
DITHER:

01:38.834 --> 01:40.917
Toast? Toast?

01:40.959 --> 01:42.166

Professor Baranova,

02:34.625 --> 02:36.083
stay back!

02:36.125 --> 02:37.333
Toast!

02:37.375 --> 02:40.208
Yes, Dither,

02:37.375 --> 02:40.208
I would like toast.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.792
Toast...

02:50.166 --> 02:52.583
What's troubling

02:50.166 --> 02:52.583
this poor Helper Bot?

02:52.625 --> 02:53.875
( shrugging )

02:53.917 --> 02:55.583
You have any sourdough?

02:55.625 --> 02:58.625
ANNA ( on screen ):

02:55.625 --> 02:58.625
That new bioelectric processor

02:58.667 --> 03:00.959
seems the most likely suspect.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.208
( giggling )

03:01.000 --> 03:03.208
A logical diagnosis.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.166
I'll let you know

03:03.250 --> 03:05.166
what we find.

03:05.208 --> 03:09.500
And thank you again, Anna,

03:05.208 --> 03:09.500
for saving Dither.

03:13.834 --> 03:16.625
And... Ahem.

03:13.834 --> 03:16.625
Thank you all as well.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.166
Anna was right.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.542
It appears that the new

03:18.208 --> 03:20.542
bioelectric chip

03:20.583 --> 03:21.917
is covered in bacteria.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.375
Bacteria!

03:23.417 --> 03:25.542
My reading has revealed

03:23.417 --> 03:25.542
that they are the culprit

03:25.583 --> 03:26.792
behind much human illness.

03:26.834 --> 03:28.208
Vile scum.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.208
Since when do bacteria

03:28.250 --> 03:31.208
make robots sick?

03:31.250 --> 03:32.458
( gasping )

03:32.500 --> 03:33.709
They can't.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.959
( sighs )

03:35.000 --> 03:37.458
But a bioelectric chip

03:35.000 --> 03:37.458
is part organic.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.917
So, bacteria could infect it.

03:38.959 --> 03:40.375
It's true.

03:40.417 --> 03:43.291
GREENE:

03:40.417 --> 03:43.291
It's what's inside that counts!

03:43.333 --> 03:44.750
FRANKIE:

03:43.333 --> 03:44.750
But Daddy,

03:44.792 --> 03:47.625
you built that bio-electric chip

03:44.792 --> 03:47.625
in the cleanroom.

03:47.667 --> 03:51.542
Yes, that is a bit mysterious.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.333
What do you mean?

03:53.375 --> 03:55.500
The cleanroom is a completely

03:53.375 --> 03:55.500
sealed area.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.125
It's free of bacteria

03:57.166 --> 03:59.166
or anything that can affect

03:57.166 --> 03:59.166
sensitive technology.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.750
Any chance your cleanroom

03:59.208 --> 04:01.750
needs cleaning, Doc?

04:01.792 --> 04:05.625
Hmm... Yes.

04:01.792 --> 04:05.625
Foreign contaminants!

04:05.667 --> 04:09.208
I'll get the ScrubMites, Daddy.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.750
Scrub whats?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.542
Microscopic

04:10.792 --> 04:12.542
bacteria-eating robots!

04:12.583 --> 04:15.458
Didn't know you had

04:12.583 --> 04:15.458
any ScrubMites, Doc.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.250
Best way to decontaminate

04:15.500 --> 04:18.250
a cleanroom.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.959
GREENE:

04:21.959 --> 04:24.959
ScrubMites are programmed

04:21.959 --> 04:24.959
to seek out

04:25.000 --> 04:26.667
and consume all bacteria,

04:26.709 --> 04:29.959
completely sanitizing

04:26.709 --> 04:29.959
any area they're in.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.625
CODY:

04:31.583 --> 04:33.625
Um, Doc,

04:33.667 --> 04:36.375
exactly what experiment

04:33.667 --> 04:36.375
did you do with donuts?

04:36.417 --> 04:38.333
That's where

04:36.417 --> 04:38.333
my breakfast went!

04:38.375 --> 04:40.375
I wonder...

04:44.458 --> 04:47.625
GREENE:

04:44.458 --> 04:47.625
Ah! Mystery solved!

04:47.667 --> 04:49.417
This donut contains

04:47.667 --> 04:49.417
the same bacteria

04:49.458 --> 04:50.917
as the bioelectric chip.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.583
KADE:

04:50.959 --> 04:52.583
Got the glass

04:50.959 --> 04:52.583
all cleaned up.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.375
We'll come back when the new

04:52.625 --> 04:55.375
window gets here, Doc.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.041
KADE:

04:56.709 --> 04:58.041
Ooh!

04:58.083 --> 05:00.000
( chomping sounds )

05:00.041 --> 05:01.792
KADE:

05:00.041 --> 05:01.792
Mmm.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.125
What? I never got any toast.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.875
Uh, Kade, that was covered

05:04.166 --> 05:06.875
in the bacteria

05:06.917 --> 05:08.291
that made Dither go wild.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.750
Not to worry, human stomachs

05:08.333 --> 05:10.750
are quite resilient.

05:10.792 --> 05:14.625
( chuckles )

05:10.792 --> 05:14.625
It won't affect Kade

05:10.792 --> 05:14.625
in the same way.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.041
If everything's

05:14.667 --> 05:17.041
under control here, Doc,

05:17.083 --> 05:19.792
we've got a lot

05:17.083 --> 05:19.792
of toasters to return.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.041
( horse neighing )

05:24.083 --> 05:26.375
Hey, Boulder,

05:24.083 --> 05:26.375
could you keep it down?

05:26.417 --> 05:28.125
Hang on, I'm almost done.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.000
Feels like there's still a pen

05:28.166 --> 05:31.000
stuck under my seat.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.750
Can you see anything?

05:32.792 --> 05:35.417
Uh...what

05:32.792 --> 05:35.417
are you guys doing?

05:35.458 --> 05:39.667
Well, Doc said, "It's what's

05:35.458 --> 05:39.667
inside that counts!"

05:39.709 --> 05:41.959
So we thought

05:39.709 --> 05:41.959
to clean out our cabs.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.875
Guys, it's not about

05:42.000 --> 05:45.875
what's literally inside you.

05:45.917 --> 05:47.875
It's just a saying.

05:47.917 --> 05:50.208
It means that what's

05:47.917 --> 05:50.208
important about someone

05:50.250 --> 05:53.208
isn't how they look,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.208
or sometimes even how they act,

05:53.250 --> 05:56.291
but who they really

05:53.250 --> 05:56.291
are...underneath.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.834
Like you, Blades.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.667
Some people might think

05:57.875 --> 05:59.667
you're a scaredy-cat,

05:59.709 --> 06:01.542
but when it comes

05:59.709 --> 06:01.542
to helping friends,

06:01.583 --> 06:04.291
you're as brave as anybody.

06:01.583 --> 06:04.291
It's true.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.750
Or like how Kade acts tough,

06:06.792 --> 06:09.834
but inside he's just

06:06.792 --> 06:09.834
a big softie.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.834
What?

06:09.875 --> 06:11.083
No way!

06:11.125 --> 06:12.333
I'm all tough,

06:11.125 --> 06:12.333
inside and...

06:12.375 --> 06:13.583
( hiccups )

06:13.625 --> 06:15.417
I'm sorry,

06:13.625 --> 06:15.417
what was that?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.625
( hiccups getting louder )

06:17.667 --> 06:19.458
Oh, wow.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.917
Must be hunger hiccups.

06:20.959 --> 06:22.291
( clears throat )

06:22.333 --> 06:24.542
Come on, time to replace

06:22.333 --> 06:24.542
Doc's window.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.542
Then let's go,

06:24.583 --> 06:27.542
Captain Cuddles.

06:27.583 --> 06:28.959
And don't call me

06:27.583 --> 06:28.959
Captain--

06:29.000 --> 06:31.291
( hiccups, groans )

06:33.333 --> 06:35.583
No foreign contaminants

06:33.333 --> 06:35.583
detected!

06:35.625 --> 06:37.500
Now to recall

06:35.625 --> 06:37.500
the ScrubMites.

06:42.458 --> 06:47.375
( bleeping sounds )

06:47.417 --> 06:48.625
Oh, my.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.417
We're missing some ScrubMites.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.000
Six, to be precise.

06:52.041 --> 06:55.417
But where could they go?

06:52.041 --> 06:55.417
The cleanroom's sealed.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.041
Not sure,

06:55.458 --> 06:58.041
my little Leeuwenhoek.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.834
I'll set these scanners

07:00.875 --> 07:02.458
to the ScrubMites'

07:00.875 --> 07:02.458
signal frequency.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.875
And we should be

07:02.500 --> 07:04.875
able to find them.

07:07.834 --> 07:10.834
Hey, Doc, Kade and Heatwave are

07:07.834 --> 07:10.834
outside with your new window.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.709
Uh, Dad, do you think

07:10.875 --> 07:13.709
the ScrubMites

07:13.750 --> 07:15.291
got outside somehow?

07:15.333 --> 07:16.750
They're much too small

07:16.792 --> 07:19.542
to have crossed

07:16.792 --> 07:19.542
the entire lab by now.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.959
Hey, Doc-- ( hiccups )

07:23.000 --> 07:24.625
How about those donuts

07:23.000 --> 07:24.625
you promised?

07:24.667 --> 07:28.542
As we agreed, Kade,

07:24.667 --> 07:28.542
after the window repair.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.125
You get donuts.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.917
I get crumbs

07:30.166 --> 07:31.917
in my cushions.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.083
Maybe you should just--

07:31.959 --> 07:34.083
( hiccups )

07:34.125 --> 07:35.333
What's wrong with you?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.000
You've been doing that

07:35.375 --> 07:37.000
all morning.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.458
( hiccups )

07:37.041 --> 07:40.458
I'm fine, I'm just--

07:37.041 --> 07:40.458
Hungry.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.625
Nothing yet, Frankie.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.625
Are you sure that--

07:45.667 --> 07:47.208
( bleeping sounds )

07:47.250 --> 07:48.542
Uh, Daddy...

07:48.583 --> 07:52.834
FRANKIE:

07:48.583 --> 07:52.834
We found the ScrubMites.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.000
Kade!

07:54.041 --> 07:55.417
FRANKIE: ScrubMites!

07:54.041 --> 07:55.417
GREENE: Don't move!

07:55.458 --> 07:57.417
I can't hear ya.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.959
W-W-Whoa!

08:00.041 --> 08:02.000
( hiccups )

08:06.208 --> 08:08.208
( glass breaking )

08:08.250 --> 08:09.500
( exhaling )

08:09.542 --> 08:10.959
Thanks Heatwave.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.208
It's all right, I'm--

08:12.250 --> 08:13.625
( hiccups )

08:13.667 --> 08:17.333
Kade... I think

08:13.667 --> 08:17.333
you better come inside.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.709
( bleeping sounds )

08:21.750 --> 08:23.417
That confirms it.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.583
GREENE:

08:23.458 --> 08:25.583
The ScrubMites

08:23.458 --> 08:25.583
are inside Kade.

08:25.625 --> 08:28.500
Inside him?

08:25.625 --> 08:28.500
What'd you do this time, Kade?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.250
But...how?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.250
The Mites must have been

08:30.291 --> 08:32.250
on that donut

08:30.291 --> 08:32.250
from the cleanroom.

08:32.291 --> 08:35.000
And you can never

08:32.291 --> 08:35.000
pass up a donut, can you?

08:35.041 --> 08:37.875
They are the bacon

08:35.041 --> 08:37.875
of breakfast food.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.625
There's no danger,

08:37.917 --> 08:39.625
is there, Doc?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.750
If these things

08:39.667 --> 08:41.750
only eat bacteria...

08:41.792 --> 08:44.959
The trouble is

08:41.792 --> 08:44.959
bacteria are everywhere.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.417
Even inside us.

08:46.458 --> 08:47.667
Hah! Not me.

08:47.709 --> 08:48.917
( hiccups )

08:48.959 --> 08:50.709
In all of us, Kade.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.583
Some bacteria are helpful

08:52.625 --> 08:54.792
and even necessary

08:52.625 --> 08:54.792
for good human health,

08:54.834 --> 08:57.125
like the ones that help

08:54.834 --> 08:57.125
with our digestion.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.583
( hiccups )

08:58.625 --> 09:02.083
Bacteria hashtag "freaky."

09:02.125 --> 09:04.375
But the Mites can't tell

09:02.125 --> 09:04.375
the difference.

09:04.417 --> 09:07.250
They're eating the good bacteria

09:04.417 --> 09:07.250
along with the bad.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.000
And that could damage

09:07.291 --> 09:09.000
your body.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.583
So these scrub-its

09:09.041 --> 09:11.583
are the reason I'm--

09:11.625 --> 09:13.750
( hiccups )

09:13.792 --> 09:15.458
I'm afraid so.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.458
BOULDER:

09:15.500 --> 09:17.458
Is there a way

09:15.500 --> 09:17.458
to shut the Scrub Mites off?

09:17.500 --> 09:21.959
Uh, nope, and their batteries

09:17.500 --> 09:21.959
last a long time.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500
I've tried to recall them

09:25.542 --> 09:27.875
but the signal

09:25.542 --> 09:27.875
won't penetrate human tissue.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.083
And they keep moving.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.792
Then surgery

09:30.125 --> 09:31.792
is out.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.375
Um, yeah-- Well, yeah!

09:33.417 --> 09:37.583
We would need to send

09:33.417 --> 09:37.583
something inside your body

09:37.625 --> 09:40.709
to track, trap, and carry

09:37.625 --> 09:40.709
the Mites back out.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.458
( whispers )

09:40.750 --> 09:43.458
Go get the minimizer.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.417
Something or someone.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.041
We have shrinking covered.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.875
Hmm... I wonder...

09:55.917 --> 09:57.375
Yes!

09:57.417 --> 10:00.542
No! You mean somebody actually

09:57.417 --> 10:00.542
go inside me?

10:00.583 --> 10:02.417
No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.417
Not this guy.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.083
We can't just

10:02.458 --> 10:04.083
do nothing, Son.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.125
Let me help you with this.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.125
Doc-- I'm willing to go.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.041
Me, too.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.041
Count me in.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.458
But there's still the problem

10:09.083 --> 10:12.458
of how we send you in.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.834
And how you carry back

10:12.500 --> 10:15.834
six ScrubMites.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.667
We can help with that.

10:19.542 --> 10:22.667
CHASE:

10:19.542 --> 10:22.667
Suitable for travel

10:19.542 --> 10:22.667
in inner as well as outer space.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.750
And plenty of room for those

10:22.709 --> 10:25.750
mites in our cargo hold.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.000
( chuckling )

10:27.041 --> 10:29.417
To go where no Bot

10:27.041 --> 10:29.417
has gone before.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.417
And with good reason,

10:29.458 --> 10:32.417
I might add.

10:32.458 --> 10:35.041
Does no one else find this

10:32.458 --> 10:35.041
a little bit creepy?

10:36.208 --> 10:38.500
Hatch closed.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.500
All set, Doc.

10:38.542 --> 10:41.959
GREENE:

10:38.542 --> 10:41.959
Have a fantastic voyage!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.667
Rescue Team, come in.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.375
Heatwave?

10:53.417 --> 10:55.125
All good, Cody.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.041
We'll let you know

10:55.166 --> 10:57.041
when we're in position.

11:04.417 --> 11:06.667
( chewing )

11:04.417 --> 11:06.667
Mmm.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.333
KADE:

11:08.625 --> 11:11.333
I feel fine.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.667
Cody, get Heatwave

11:11.375 --> 11:13.667
on the comtab.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.166
I'm calling this

11:13.709 --> 11:15.166
mission off.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.500
Um...little late

11:15.208 --> 11:17.500
for that.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.542
Those red dots

11:17.542 --> 11:19.542
are the ScrubMites and--

11:19.583 --> 11:21.458
The green dot is the Bots' ship.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.583
What? Wait--

11:21.500 --> 11:23.583
You mean it's already--

11:23.625 --> 11:25.208
But how did you--

11:25.250 --> 11:27.417
Heatwave said he'd steer clear

11:25.250 --> 11:27.417
of your teeth.

11:29.458 --> 11:35.709
HEATWAVE:

11:29.458 --> 11:35.709
Here we go! A-ha! Yeah!

11:37.500 --> 11:38.750
BLADES:

11:37.500 --> 11:38.750
We're here!

11:38.792 --> 11:40.875
Wherever that is.

11:44.083 --> 11:47.000
There's our first batch.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.041
You'd better stay

11:47.041 --> 11:49.041
with the ship.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.667
Not sure how long humans

11:49.083 --> 11:51.667
can last out there.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.792
Not sure how long I can last.

12:05.583 --> 12:08.333
No wonder humans

12:05.583 --> 12:08.333
can't transform.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.041
They're missing

12:08.375 --> 12:10.041
so many parts.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.291
Eew. Squishy!

12:13.333 --> 12:16.667
What'd ya know,

12:13.333 --> 12:16.667
Kade is a big softie inside.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.250
( giggling )

12:18.291 --> 12:19.625
Whoa!

12:19.667 --> 12:22.208
Tickled from the inside.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.208
Weird.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.917
( hissing sounds )

12:26.959 --> 12:29.208
What is that

12:26.959 --> 12:29.208
toxic liquid?

12:29.250 --> 12:32.291
DANI ( over com ):

12:29.250 --> 12:32.291
Acid. We're in Kade's stomach.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.208
( whirring sounds )

12:35.250 --> 12:37.333
BLADES:

12:35.250 --> 12:37.333
Didn't know they'd be

12:35.250 --> 12:37.333
so big.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.792
They're not.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.792
We're really small.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.959
Okay.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.959
No sudden moves.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.208
Go slow and--

12:42.000 --> 12:45.208
Power up and energize!

12:45.250 --> 12:47.625
( sighing )

12:45.250 --> 12:47.625
Surprise them.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.208
Ha.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.208
Consider yourself burned.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.083
( whirring sounds )

13:11.125 --> 13:12.375
( grunting )

13:13.166 --> 13:14.959
Yee-haw!

13:19.667 --> 13:21.875
( grunting )

13:21.917 --> 13:24.458
They're a little bigger

13:21.917 --> 13:24.458
than we planned on.

13:26.667 --> 13:27.917
That'll hold 'em.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.583
Three down, Cody.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.208
BURNS:

13:33.625 --> 13:35.208
Where to next?

13:35.250 --> 13:37.375
The other three Mites

13:35.250 --> 13:37.375
are near Kade's spine.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.875
Sending you a map.

13:41.250 --> 13:44.291
( whirring sounds )

13:44.333 --> 13:46.041
Anybody hear

13:44.333 --> 13:46.041
that scratching?

14:10.625 --> 14:13.417
Humans do retain

14:10.625 --> 14:13.417
many types of fluids.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.834
Fascinating structure.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.834
Look, Heatwave.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.500
Kade isn't spineless.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.000
We'll sightsee later.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.000
There!

14:21.041 --> 14:23.166
( whirring sounds )

14:25.250 --> 14:26.834
( energy crackling )

14:26.875 --> 14:28.792
Ah! Lightning!

14:37.041 --> 14:39.041
( all yelp )

14:39.083 --> 14:41.125
BURNS:

14:39.083 --> 14:41.125
Everybody okay out there?

14:41.166 --> 14:45.000
Negative. Do all humans contain

14:41.166 --> 14:45.000
inclement weather, or only Kade?

14:45.041 --> 14:47.709
GRAHAM:

14:45.041 --> 14:47.709
It's not weather.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.709
See that glow moving down?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.208
Electricity?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.959
A pulse from the brain.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.542
Like a message, telling

14:53.000 --> 14:55.542
Kade's body to do something.

14:55.583 --> 14:58.000
Then tell Kade

14:55.583 --> 14:58.000
to stop his brain!

14:58.041 --> 14:59.458
That shouldn't be too hard.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.834
Stop thinking!

15:01.083 --> 15:02.834
Hey!

15:02.875 --> 15:05.125
GREENE:

15:02.875 --> 15:05.125
He doesn't need

15:02.875 --> 15:05.125
to stop his brain,

15:05.166 --> 15:06.917
he needs to stop his foot.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.834
Kade, you're causing

15:06.959 --> 15:08.834
a lightning storm!

15:08.875 --> 15:11.041
My feet were tingling.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.417
( bleeping sounds )

15:12.458 --> 15:14.542
Ah, great.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.542
Now Hayley's mad at me.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.000
Autocorrect. I meant

15:14.583 --> 15:18.000
"forever," not "football."

15:18.041 --> 15:21.625
Hmmm... Play back

15:18.041 --> 15:21.625
that video of the pulse, Cody.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.291
There!

15:27.333 --> 15:30.166
The ScrubMites have been eating

15:27.333 --> 15:30.166
your myelin sheath, Kade.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.667
My... Huh?

15:31.709 --> 15:33.041
Myelin sheath.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.375
It's a protective

15:33.083 --> 15:35.375
outer coating on nerves.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.625
Like...

15:36.667 --> 15:37.959
The plastic

15:36.667 --> 15:37.959
around a wire.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.583
With the coating gone,

15:39.625 --> 15:42.458
the electrical pulses shoot out

15:39.625 --> 15:42.458
from the exposed nerves.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.875
And make your feet tingle.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.041
So my feet are going

15:43.917 --> 15:46.041
to tingle football--

15:46.083 --> 15:47.875
I mean, forever?

15:47.917 --> 15:51.709
The myelin will heal with time

15:47.917 --> 15:51.709
once the Mites stop eating it.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.208
But for now...

15:57.625 --> 16:00.000
KADE:

15:57.625 --> 16:00.000
Sorry, guys.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.792
Oh, You wish to see

16:02.834 --> 16:05.792
which of us can pinch harder?

16:05.834 --> 16:07.750
Challenge accepted.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.417
Power up and energize!

16:28.959 --> 16:31.500
Easy, big fella.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.500
Gotcha!

16:40.959 --> 16:42.208
Ah!

16:44.291 --> 16:45.709
Ow!

16:45.750 --> 16:48.125
I... I can't feel my legs.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.750
( groaning )

16:51.792 --> 16:53.458
I think I struck a nerve.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.083
I got this, Heatwave.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.458
( grunting )

16:58.458 --> 17:00.125
HEATWAVE:

16:58.458 --> 17:00.125
Here.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.583
( grinding sounds )

17:11.625 --> 17:14.083
They're eating into the ship.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.083
We have to hurry.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.709
Blades, you sure

17:14.125 --> 17:15.709
you're okay?

17:15.750 --> 17:20.208
My tail skid still tingles,

17:15.750 --> 17:20.208
but other than that...

17:20.250 --> 17:21.917
Cody, we have

17:20.250 --> 17:21.917
all the ScrubMites.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.875
Now, how do we get

17:21.959 --> 17:23.875
outta here?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.375
Follow the spinal column

17:23.917 --> 17:26.375
up to Kade's head.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.667
Plenty of exits there.

17:30.709 --> 17:35.250
( engine sputtering )

17:35.291 --> 17:37.041
BOULDER:

17:35.291 --> 17:37.041
The Mites must have eaten

17:37.083 --> 17:38.709
through the ignition panel!

17:40.709 --> 17:42.667
Maybe we can reroute

17:40.709 --> 17:42.667
the circuit.

17:45.709 --> 17:48.875
Circuit is active

17:45.709 --> 17:48.875
but we don't have any power.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.583
We need a jump.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.583
From where?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.583
One of the other ships

17:50.625 --> 17:52.583
inside Kade?

17:52.625 --> 17:56.458
Kade can provide

17:52.625 --> 17:56.458
the jolt.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.125
All he has to do is move

17:56.500 --> 18:00.125
his foot and-- Kapow! Lightning.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.834
BOULDER:

18:00.166 --> 18:01.834
That could give us

18:00.166 --> 18:01.834
enough power

18:01.875 --> 18:03.375
to restart the engine.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.041
How am I to do that?

18:03.417 --> 18:06.041
I can't feel my feet.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.750
Ha! No problem.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.917
GREENE:

18:07.792 --> 18:09.917
For an electric pulse to go from

18:07.792 --> 18:09.917
his brain

18:09.959 --> 18:12.959
down his nerves,

18:09.959 --> 18:12.959
Kade must make his foot move.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.542
Do it, Kade.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.583
Everyone inside you

18:14.583 --> 18:16.583
is counting on it.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.959
( grunting )

18:18.000 --> 18:19.917
HEATWAVE:

18:18.000 --> 18:19.917
Hey, from in here,

18:19.959 --> 18:23.166
it looks like you've gone

18:19.959 --> 18:23.166
all soft...Captain Cuddles.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.792
I told you,

18:24.834 --> 18:28.000
don't call me Captain Cuddles!

18:35.583 --> 18:37.333
( engine revving )

18:44.417 --> 18:46.875
( loud rumbling sound )

18:46.917 --> 18:49.917
I'll check on it.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.917
Keep us moving.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.250
The ScrubMites

18:53.375 --> 18:56.250
are getting loose.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.083
Heatwave, do you

18:56.291 --> 18:58.083
require assistance?

18:58.125 --> 18:59.834
No.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.458
HEATWAVE:

18:59.875 --> 19:01.458
Just get us

18:59.875 --> 19:01.458
out of Kade...now!

19:01.500 --> 19:03.709
But, where are we?

19:03.750 --> 19:06.083
CODY:

19:03.750 --> 19:06.083
You're in Kade's

19:03.750 --> 19:06.083
nasal cavity.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.417
DANI ( via com ):

19:06.125 --> 19:08.417
Eww! I had to ask.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.959
Nasal?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.834
No problemo.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.834
I'll get 'em out of there.

19:13.959 --> 19:16.667
What?

19:13.959 --> 19:16.667
I can sneeze on command.

19:16.709 --> 19:18.291
How could you

19:16.709 --> 19:18.291
not know that about me?

19:18.333 --> 19:20.291
Everyone better strap in.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.583
Air leaving the nose

19:20.333 --> 19:22.583
during a sneeze

19:22.625 --> 19:25.000
can travel more than

19:22.625 --> 19:25.000
100 miles per hour.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.625
Cool.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.625
Noble.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.625
And "eww" again.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.542
Ready for launch.

19:32.583 --> 19:33.792
( inhaling deeply )

19:33.834 --> 19:36.583
Power up and energize!

19:36.625 --> 19:38.750
Ah...ah...

19:38.792 --> 19:41.291
choo!

19:41.333 --> 19:44.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:44.583 --> 19:45.834
Whoa!

19:48.792 --> 19:50.250
CODY:

19:48.792 --> 19:50.250
Did you make it?

19:50.291 --> 19:51.709
Where are you?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.417
All I can see is yellow.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
And the ScrubMites

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
are getting loose!

20:04.542 --> 20:07.875
Don't worry, Heatwave.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.875
All ScrubMites accounted for!

20:07.917 --> 20:10.166
Yellow...

20:40.542 --> 20:43.125
Kade, are you okay?

20:40.542 --> 20:43.125
Have you seen what you eat?

20:43.166 --> 20:45.125
Nice sneeze, bud.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.125
Your bone structure is amazing.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.917
Your fluids appear

20:45.166 --> 20:46.917
adequately viscous.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.959
I don't even want to think

20:46.959 --> 20:48.959
about what I was walking on.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.917
Doc says I'm fine.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.291
Thanks to you, guys.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.709
Thank you

20:52.333 --> 20:54.709
for the ride home.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.583
Well, guess you had it in you

20:54.750 --> 20:57.583
after all, Captain.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.875
What's inside does count,

20:59.917 --> 21:02.667
but sometimes getting

20:59.917 --> 21:02.667
what's inside out

21:02.709 --> 21:04.750
can be just as important.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.834
Oh, my.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.834
I'm late.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.667
Professor Baranova and I are

21:06.875 --> 21:09.667
meeting for an experiment.

21:09.709 --> 21:11.583
Over dinner.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.834
Oh.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.583
Hey, uh, Heatwave.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.583
Seriously, though...

21:18.625 --> 21:20.667
Don't call me that again.

21:20.709 --> 21:25.166
Ha! Tough guy.

21:20.709 --> 21:25.166
You know it.

21:20.709 --> 21:25.166
Inside and out...

21:25.208 --> 21:26.625
Which reminds me.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.542
You still have some

21:26.667 --> 21:29.542
vacuuming to do. Ha, ha!

21:29.583 --> 21:32.375
Crumbs in your cushion,

21:29.583 --> 21:32.375
ha, ha!

21:33.500 --> 21:36.417
