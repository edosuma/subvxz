WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:03.204
(Danny)
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.239
I know I haven't been in here
in a while,

00:05.306 --> 00:07.508
so I got some serious
confessing to do.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.677
Is it masturbating again?

00:09.743 --> 00:12.012
No, no.
It's not that.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.581
[sighs]
Okay, here we go.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.316
I screened a phone call
from Ma,

00:15.383 --> 00:17.451
I coveted my butcher's
Mean Streets poster,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.420
I knocked up my
live-in girlfriend,

00:19.487 --> 00:20.721
I used the Lord's name
in vain.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.524
Wait, wait.
What--what was that one before?

00:23.591 --> 00:24.625
The Mean Stree poster?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.460
No. After that.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.262
[sighs]
Okay, I engaged in sex

00:28.329 --> 00:30.564
with a pre-marital persuasion,
but it wasn't my fault.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.567
I was--I was under a spell
of this exotic sorceress.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.369
I mean, she wears
all these bright colors,

00:35.436 --> 00:37.105
and she uses all this
R-rated language,

00:37.171 --> 00:38.272
and the next thing you know,
Father,

00:38.339 --> 00:40.208
we are going at it in bed.

00:40.274 --> 00:44.078
This accidentally happened
a couple hundred times,

00:44.145 --> 00:45.613
and then the Lord finally
punished us

00:45.679 --> 00:47.348
with the precious gift
of life.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.782
But hey, you know,
it proves I wasn't

00:48.849 --> 00:52.286
using protection,
right, Father?

00:52.353 --> 00:54.188
- Father?
- [crashing]

00:54.255 --> 00:55.189
(Danny)
Oh, God!

00:55.256 --> 00:58.192
[hip-hip music]

00:58.259 --> 00:59.627
*

00:59.693 --> 01:02.430
(Jeremy)
Oh, okay.
First order of business:

01:02.496 --> 01:04.398
Mindy, if you want
to change the screensaver

01:04.465 --> 01:07.101
on all the computers
to your sonogram

01:07.168 --> 01:08.269
there's a form for that.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.104
First of all,
how dare you insult

01:10.171 --> 01:12.072
my unborn son's
first tasteful nudes.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.274
- Come on, man.
- Second of all,

01:13.341 --> 01:14.775
I didn't do that.
Danny did.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.777
He's, like, obsessed
with being a dad.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.112
I just want to say
congratulations.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.280
You're having a boy.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.315
Yes, biologically
she is a boy.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.750
But who knows what
she will identify with.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.817
I could still win.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.686
Okay, so now some
personal business.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.588
Uh, my one man show
has been accepted

01:27.655 --> 01:30.324
has been accepted into
the Midtown Fringe Festival.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.859
[applause and cheers]

01:31.925 --> 01:34.228
Stop it, stop it.
Anyway, the show's about

01:34.295 --> 01:37.298
a young mousy boy
who escapes to the United States

01:37.365 --> 01:39.099
for a better life.
And, uh, maybe has

01:39.167 --> 01:40.368
a couple of adventures
along the way.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.802
So you're basically
Fievel?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.237
I don't know who
that is.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.505
What's the name
of your play?

01:44.572 --> 01:46.507
An American Tale.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.808
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't go.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.444
Because I really
don't want to go.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.180
See, this is the problem
with this country.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.414
No respect for the arts.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.115
That's why you have to
come crawling to us

01:55.183 --> 01:56.817
for your Lincolns
and your Batmans.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.420
I just killed
My priest.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.489
Oh, okay. Fine.
He doesn't have to come.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.559
This is all our fault.
I was confessing

02:05.626 --> 02:08.162
to Father Francis
and his heart couldn't take it.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.863
- Wait, that's what happened?
- Yes.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.200
Okay, Danny, I think you're
being a little theatrical.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.667
There's gonna be
a memorial service.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.668
Will you come with me?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.170
- To church?
- Yeah.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.306
You killed someone,
now I have to die of boredom?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.274
Look, Father Francis
never absolved me.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.542
Now I have to confess
to the new priest,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.211
or when I die,
I won't get into heaven.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.712
Besides, don't you want
to meet the guy

02:24.778 --> 02:26.214
that's gonna baptize
our baby?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.748
Who says he's
gonna get baptized?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.583
I kinda want to raise him Jewish
so he can get ahead in life.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.785
Mindy, please.
Church is really important to me

02:31.852 --> 02:33.487
and I want you
to be a part of it.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.856
You're so adorable
when you're anxious.

02:35.923 --> 02:36.890
Yes, I will come with you.

02:36.957 --> 02:37.891
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.360
Great. Thank you.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.828
It'll be good for the new priest
to get a visual of you

02:40.894 --> 02:42.430
so when I talk about you
in confession he can,

02:42.496 --> 02:43.697
you know, picture it.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.933
Um, I don't love you
talking to a priest about me.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.502
How'd you like it if I had
a podcast about our sex life?

02:48.569 --> 02:49.637
Oh, come on.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.172
Because I do have one.
For the past six months.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.173
What?

02:54.408 --> 02:55.876
(Danny)
Great, we're late.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.611
Now we can't sit
in the front row.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.179
Hi.
How are you?

02:59.247 --> 03:00.314
Oh, my God.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.949
How old was
Father Francis?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.384
Was he Jesus' roommate?

03:03.451 --> 03:05.286
No. Jesus didn't have
a roommate.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.522
He lived with
his Ma.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.624
Hachi machi.
Who's the guy in the dress?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.892
- He's hot as hell.
- Wait a minute.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.694
I know that guy.
That's Mike O'Donnell,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.195
from my old neighborhood.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.831
He was the worst kid in my
high school, now he's a priest?

03:17.898 --> 03:20.301
That guy's a virgin?
Ah, man, what a waste.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.869
Shh.
Quiet.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.573
275.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.675
Any guesses on what
that number means?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.643
How many hours
I've been sitting here?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.845
That's the number of women
I've had sex with.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.448
[murmuring]

03:34.515 --> 03:35.749
Now I'm sure some of you
are saying,

03:35.816 --> 03:40.854
"How can a man who has sinned
in so many different ways...

03:40.921 --> 03:41.922
"and positions--

03:41.989 --> 03:45.593
"How can a man
with a sleeve of tattoos,

03:45.659 --> 03:49.763
"a man who did drugs,
crazy drugs,

03:49.830 --> 03:53.401
how can that man be in charge
of your spiritual guidance?"

03:53.467 --> 03:54.968
Wow.
Mike's done everything.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.937
I mean, confessing to him
will be a breeze.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.372
(Michael)
God comes to us in many ways.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.308
For Saint Paul,
it was a bolt of lightning

04:00.374 --> 04:01.875
on the road to Damascus.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.844
For me, it was Keith Richards.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.281
He found me on his
bathroom floor of his house,

04:07.348 --> 04:09.283
which I had broken into.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
And he said to me...

04:11.419 --> 04:13.421
[mumbles indistinctly]

04:13.487 --> 04:16.590
And as his security team dragged
me out of his house,

04:16.657 --> 04:20.761
I knew that I had a purpose
in life,

04:20.828 --> 04:24.332
and that was to lead people away
from sins great and small.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.767
Because it's not always
the big sins that matter,

04:26.834 --> 04:29.002
like when I slept
with my SAT proctor

04:29.069 --> 04:30.638
and ruined her marriage.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.906
No, sometimes
it's the small sins

04:32.973 --> 04:35.275
that tarnish the soul the most.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.578
I'm talking about birth control,

04:37.645 --> 04:41.515
cohabiting before marriage,
and dating outside of the faith.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.651
Trust me,
these little sins

04:43.717 --> 04:46.987
are just as straight a path
to hellfire

04:47.054 --> 04:49.457
as all that really cool stuff
I used to do.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.759
Really?
I feel like they're not.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.960
Now, let's all bow our heads

04:53.026 --> 04:55.729
for one final prayer
for Father Francis.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.431
He was a good guy.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.633
A good, soft guy.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.303
May God forgive him
for his leniency.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.606
Leniency?
We're screwed.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.074
You're screwed.
I'm Hindu.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.709
I'm like immortal
or something.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.744
* Agnus Dei

05:10.811 --> 05:13.481
* Qui tollis peccata mundi

05:13.547 --> 05:17.851
* Agnus Dei

05:17.918 --> 05:19.319
By next Sunday you should
all know Latin.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.723
(Danny)
Let's go, come on.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.057
You were in the bathroom for,
like, an hour.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.158
(Mindy) There's a lot
of elderly people here, okay.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.560
I need a new church, okay?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.928
St. Ignatius has one of
those guitar-priests.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.762
But you know what?
I can get over it.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.864
- Let's get out of here.
- Danny?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.833
Danny Castellano?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.902
- Hey.
- Hi, Friar, I'm Mindy.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.070
- I so enjoyed your speech.
- Sermon.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.606
Yes, it was the best part
of the show.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.441
- Mass.
- Yeah.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.609
So you're Danny's girlfriend?

05:41.675 --> 05:42.943
I've heard a lot about you.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.512
Oh, my God!

05:44.578 --> 05:46.414
Are you
my one Twitter follower?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.716
It is great to meet you,
@OneDirectionBot.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.384
- I--
- Hey, Mike, good to see you--

05:50.451 --> 05:52.853
I'm sorry.
Father Michael.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.722
Hard to adjust.
I'm used to calling you

05:54.788 --> 05:56.724
The Virginity Thief
of Staten Island.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.592
Yeah, I remember you too,
Danny.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.928
You were the little altar boy
who would always snitch on me

06:00.994 --> 06:02.530
whenever I would take the girls
back to the rectory

06:02.596 --> 06:03.797
to fool around.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.535
Danny here, always
such a little angel.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.669
Sorry.
You know me.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.004
Always walking
the straight and narrow.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.006
(Mindy)
Yeah, I have
a scriptural question.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.476
I know that the church frowns
on masturbation...

06:15.543 --> 06:16.710
- Mm-hmm.
- But what is their policy

06:16.777 --> 06:18.646
on hot-tub jets?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.414
Hey, listen,
here's 5 bucks.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.015
Why don't you go enter us
into the raffle, okay?

06:22.082 --> 06:23.884
Okay.
[clears throat]

06:23.951 --> 06:25.953
So wonderful to meet you,
Your Magistrate.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.488
- Okay.
- You don't--

06:27.555 --> 06:28.756
- She doesn't have to do that.
- You're hand--

06:28.822 --> 06:30.658
Okay.
[chuckles]

06:30.724 --> 06:32.392
She's different.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.628
I gotta admit, Danny,
I've heard some rumors.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.497
- You have?
- Yeah.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.099
Look, the word
on the pew is that

06:39.166 --> 06:43.471
the Golden Boy of St. Mary's
and his girlfriend

06:43.537 --> 06:45.473
are living together
before marriage.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.508
Oh!
That?

06:47.575 --> 06:48.609
That's what you heard?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.444
Yes, yes, we are,

06:50.511 --> 06:52.813
but we are definitely
waiting before we,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.949
you know...do it.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.117
Look, Danny, I get it.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.487
The Vatican's fine
with over-the-pants stuff.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.022
I just don't want people to
think you're a bad Catholic.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.824
People like me.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.059
What? No way.
We're both great Catholics.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.162
Especially her.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.899
Oh, I had no idea
she was of the faith.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.501
Yeah, she's of the faith.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.936
Okay, everyone,
just stick your tongues out.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.171
Stop.
Stop.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.741
So, Ma, I was thinking
we should change churches.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.776
What do you think about
The Immaculate Heart?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.578
That's for Puerto Ricans.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.079
What's communion?
Chips and salsa?

07:26.146 --> 07:28.148
Why would we switch
churches anyway?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.183
The new priest.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.486
You remember
Michael O'Donnell?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
- [scoffs]
- Mikey O'Donnell?

07:34.722 --> 07:36.156
The hooligan
from down the block?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.692
You know, he babysat
for you and Richie once.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.762
I come home, he's got a girl
on top of the ping-pong table.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.863
(Danny)
Yeah, I remember that.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.997
They left a dent on the table.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.499
Made the balls bounce weird.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.800
And I don't know.
I don't feel comfortable

07:46.867 --> 07:48.769
confessing my situation
to him.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.170
So don't confess.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.906
You're not exactly winning
Catholic-of-the-year anyway.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.175
You're divorced,
you go to a gay gym--

07:55.242 --> 07:58.011
You don't encounter it
if you stay out of the sauna.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.547
Plus, their bodies
motivate me.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.649
Why do you care
what Mikey thinks?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.183
- Your mother's over it.
- Hmm.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.052
She still hasn't forgiven me
for taping over

08:05.118 --> 08:08.055
Princess Diana's wedding with an
episode of The Price Is Right...

08:08.121 --> 08:09.523
that I was on.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.860
Maybe the problem
isn't the priest.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.227
You gotta start
thinking about

08:14.294 --> 08:17.898
why you feel so guilty
about this.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.967
(Morgan)
All right, let's take it
from the top.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.269
Okay, so I said
to the immigration officer,

08:22.335 --> 08:25.573
"You know who I am?
I'm Dr. Jeremy Reeve."

08:25.639 --> 08:27.507
- Reed!
- Reed! Why can't I get that?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.777
I'll tell you why,
and I don't mean to be cruel,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.179
but you're the worst actor
I've ever seen in my life, okay?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.581
No, I can act.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.948
It's just I can't
remember the lines.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.650
Oh, good, you're not
doing anything.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.686
- Hey, I need your advice.
- Absolutely not.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.287
- I'm incredibly busy.
- He's very busy.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.990
Fine, I will buy a lousy
ticket to your loser show.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.892
Take a seat.
How can I help?

08:44.958 --> 08:45.959
Thank you.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.695
When I was at church
with Danny

08:47.761 --> 08:49.763
and he introduced me
to his priest,

08:49.830 --> 08:51.064
I felt like he was
embarrassed by me.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.900
Come on, stop.
Danny has never even been

08:52.966 --> 08:54.234
slightly embarrassed by you.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.303
Really?
[sighs] Okay.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.139
- That's a huge relief.
- See, I can act, Morgan.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.841
Of course he's embarrassed
by you.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.209
But the point is,
if embarrassment

09:02.275 --> 09:04.745
was gonna ruin the relationship,
it would have happened by now.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.948
Sounds like the problem
is this priest.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.149
You want me to
murder a priest?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.784
Befriend the priest.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.286
Of course.
Befriend a priest.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.825
[typing]

09:51.258 --> 09:52.626
A what now?

09:54.895 --> 09:55.963
(Danny)
Okay, name me the Apostles.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.164
- John.
- Good.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.666
- Paul.
- Excellent.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.267
- George.
- You're naming Beatles.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.202
- Bongo.
- That's not anything.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.104
- Mary Margarine.
- No!

10:04.171 --> 10:06.306
Why did you invite
Father Michael over for dinner?

10:06.373 --> 10:09.109
Okay, look, if he asks,
we sleep in bunk beds

10:09.176 --> 10:10.610
and your last name's McPherson.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.846
Why would you lie and tell him
that I was Catholic?

10:12.913 --> 10:15.215
I don't have a Catholic bone
in my body, except yours.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.785
See? I can't stop saying
hilarious stuff like that!

10:17.851 --> 10:20.153
I have the mind of a comedian
trapped in the body of a model

10:20.220 --> 10:21.789
trapped in the job
of a gynecologist.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.726
We should have just gone with
Morgan to Jeremy's stupid play.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.361
Morgan.
That's it.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.930
(Jeremy)
Morgan, I'm freaking out.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.098
I don't remember any
of my lines.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.632
Hey, easy.
I told you.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.034
I have every single one
of the lines in the play

10:34.101 --> 10:35.335
on my phone.
It's gonna be fine.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.336
[phone rings]
- Okay.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.771
- Oh, oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.206
Aye, machi hachi.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.874
Easy, easy,
just chill one second.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.375
I'm gonna take
a personal call.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.777
Talk to me, player.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.378
Hey, um, what do you know
about Catholicism?

10:45.445 --> 10:46.914
Pfft!
Only everything.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.648
Oh, perfect.
Okay, so you know about, like,

10:48.716 --> 10:49.783
the Popes and sacraments
and stuff?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.651
Oh, Catholicism.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.286
I thought you said
"alcoholism."

10:53.353 --> 10:55.355
- Yeah, I don't know anything.
- Okay, whatever.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.324
Will you look stuff up
if I text you with questions?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.092
Pfft!
Yeah, I'm at this boring play.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
- It'll give me something to do.
- Hey.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.963
(Mindy)
Okay, thank you, Morgan.
Bye.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.431
[door closes]

11:04.497 --> 11:05.999
Okay, if Father Mike asks you
to say grace,

11:06.066 --> 11:07.267
say you have laryngitis.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.003
Okay, well, I just got off
the phone with Morgan, and...

11:10.070 --> 11:12.773
- Yeah?
- Everything is taken care of.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.074
- Feeling okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.243
No, I feel--I feel good.
I feel calm and grounded.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.277
[doorbell rings]

11:17.344 --> 11:18.411
Ah!

11:18.478 --> 11:20.213
All right, be cool, be cool.
That's him.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.214
- Okay.
- So be cool.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.750
(Mindy)
You be cool, psycho.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.251
Father Michael,
exactly on time.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.986
We got nothing to hide.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.856
Don't worry, Danny.
You couldn't.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.758
- Ms. McPherson!
- That's me.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.192
- Lovely to see you.
- Sorry about her.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.961
- She's a real klutz.
- Yeah.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.934
- What's that?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.370
Some people still get dressed up
for the theater.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.973
Hey, shh.
I have to focus.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.742
(Jeremy)
London, 1985.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.877
[mouthing silently]

11:49.943 --> 11:51.244
(Jeremy)
A little boy walks
with his father.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.180
[child voice]
Daddy, who are those dirty men?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.082
They look so sad.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.284
[adult voice]
They're no-good coal miners
on strike!

11:57.350 --> 11:59.352
Throw a rock at them
or I'll swat at you.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.955
[child voice]
But I want to help them someday,

12:02.022 --> 12:03.223
or my name isn't...

12:03.290 --> 12:05.058
[normal voice]
Jeremy Reed.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.293
[scattered applause]

12:06.359 --> 12:08.095
But let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

12:08.161 --> 12:12.132
Our story actually begins
in 1545.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.212
* And may all sinners
burn forever *

12:25.278 --> 12:27.180
* In fires of hell

12:27.247 --> 12:30.851
* Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhhh

12:30.918 --> 12:33.353
* Amen-nan-nan-nan-na

12:33.420 --> 12:35.923
Mindy, once again, thank you so
much for having me for dinner.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.490
[phone chimes]
- The nun that usually

12:37.557 --> 12:40.260
cooks for me is blind, so I end
up eating a lot of candle wax.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.195
You know,
hospitality is so important.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.833
I think it was God that said,

12:45.899 --> 12:47.534
"He who withholds kindness
from a friend

12:47.600 --> 12:49.302
forsakes the fear
of the Almighty."

12:49.369 --> 12:52.239
That's Job 6:14.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.441
Ah, do you have a favorite verse
from The New Testament?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.476
- The New Testament?
- The new one?

12:56.543 --> 12:59.112
There's a sequel to The Bible,
but not to Gone Girl?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.348
[phone chimes]
Um, The New Testament

13:01.414 --> 13:04.251
has so many great one-liners,
but I think my favorite's

13:04.317 --> 13:06.519
probably, "Jeremy,
you spilled my Scotch.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.822
Go sit in your cupboard."

13:08.889 --> 13:10.490
Afraid I don't know that one.
That's a bit of a deep cut,

13:10.557 --> 13:13.093
even for a priest.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.329
(Jeremy)
Father, it's dark in here
and I'm afraid.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.330
[phone chimes]

13:20.200 --> 13:23.036
So I said, "Father, you can
lock me in the cupboard,

13:23.103 --> 13:27.074
but you can never
lock up my spirit."

13:27.140 --> 13:31.811
And then my father
said to me...

13:31.879 --> 13:32.980
[whispering]
Morgan?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.815
I'm sorry, Dr. Reed,
I gotta leave, gotta leave.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.584
What?
No, Morgan, Morgan--

13:37.650 --> 13:39.552
You need to tell me what
my father said to me.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.354
- Excuse me.
- Mo--Morgan.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.256
(Jeremy)
We had a deal.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.424
- Oh, I tripped!
- Ow!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.559
- What did my father--
- Oh, my cigarette.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.928
- Shh! Shh!
- I don't know.

13:47.995 --> 13:48.962
- For God's sake.
- Morgan.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.330
- Damn it to hell.
- I'm so sorry.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.265
That was--
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.236
- Oh, whoa!
- Oh! Oh, my hair!

13:56.303 --> 13:59.406
In that moment,
I decided to go to America,

13:59.472 --> 14:02.042
where the sun always shines.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.376
[fire alarm blares]

14:03.443 --> 14:07.314
[all screaming]

14:07.380 --> 14:10.951
(Mindy)
I mean, that's why I think
The Bible's on fleek.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.252
Huh, you know,
I never thought of Eve

14:12.319 --> 14:15.122
as one of
the "Real Housewives of Eden."

14:15.188 --> 14:17.490
Then again,
she did love her drama.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.092
You got a good one here, Danny.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.593
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.162
I have got to go to
the little priests' room.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.197
Oh, it's right
over here, Father.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.532
Hot's on the left,
cold's on the right.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.901
Standard sink stuff.
You'll figure it out.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.236
Hey, great job,
little Catholic.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.370
I know.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.939
Father Michael
will have no idea

14:32.005 --> 14:35.008
that we're two sinful,
contraceptive-using--

14:35.075 --> 14:36.643
- Oh, no.
- What?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.279
Danny, do you remember when you
told me, like, a million times

14:39.346 --> 14:41.414
to take the condoms out
of the medicine cabinet before

14:41.481 --> 14:43.083
- Father Michael got here?
- Yeah.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.985
You didn't, like, do that
because you knew

14:45.052 --> 14:46.153
that I would flake, right?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.454
Oh, no.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.588
(Danny)
What were you thinking?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.157
Maybe he won't snoop.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
Oh, who am I kidding?
Everybody snoops.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.392
When I first went
to your mom's house,

14:52.459 --> 14:53.560
I tried on
her wedding dress.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.595
There's only one
thing to do.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.197
- No.
- I'm going in.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.232
- No!
- I'm going in.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.234
Wait, Mindy.
Do not look at his thing.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.602
Okay, if I see his thing,
it's an accident.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.372
And don't get distracted by your
reflection in the mirror.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.109
* Walking in Memphis,
in Memphis *

15:09.176 --> 15:10.110
* But do I really feel...

15:13.013 --> 15:15.648
* Walking in Memphis,
in Memphis *

15:15.715 --> 15:19.252
* But do I really feel
the way I feel? *

15:19.319 --> 15:23.056
* I saw the ghost
of Elvis down... *

15:23.123 --> 15:24.391
[stops urinating]

15:28.028 --> 15:30.397
[resumes urinating]
* I saw the ghost of Elvis

15:30.463 --> 15:33.967
* Down on Union Avenue

15:34.034 --> 15:38.405
* I followed him up
to the gates of Graceland *

15:38.471 --> 15:39.572
* And I watched him walk
right through *

15:39.639 --> 15:41.441
[toilet flushes]

15:41.508 --> 15:42.509
* Now securi--

15:45.712 --> 15:47.147
[clears throat]
Danny, I saw something

15:47.214 --> 15:49.049
pretty disturbing
in your bathroom just now.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.683
Okay, you did?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.986
It's your Yankees poster,
Danny.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.187
You know they're
the team of sin.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.223
- [sighs]
- A-Rod, that's lust.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.558
CC Sabathia, gluttony.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.727
Jeter, sloth.
He retired.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.195
What if Jesus had retired?

16:02.262 --> 16:04.531
You're right, Father.
I'm a Mets fan now.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.199
Thank you so much.
What a great night.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.400
I'll see you at church
on Sunday.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.369
Sunday?
Come on!

16:09.436 --> 16:11.604
Let's get some dessert.
Let's play some board games.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.506
I'm a priest!
This is my crack!

16:15.308 --> 16:18.111
Okay, use "nom-nom-nom"
in a sentence.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.112
Okay.
Wasn't hungry.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.747
I saw that corn dog,
and I was like,

16:20.813 --> 16:21.748
"Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom!"

16:21.814 --> 16:23.383
- Okay, fair enough.
- Yes!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.252
- Danny, can I be honest?
- Yeah.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.754
I came here tonight because
I heard a disturbing rumor.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.124
I heard you were dating
a godless sex maniac.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.992
But that must have been
an ex-girlfriend,

16:33.060 --> 16:34.527
because it's certainly
not Mindy,

16:34.594 --> 16:36.496
who is one of the finest women
I have ever met.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.531
Thank you.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.733
Yes, yes,
it was an ex-girlfriend,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.270
and, man, she was trouble,
bad news.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.637
(Michael)
Hey, I get it.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.006
I mean, back in the day,
I dated some crazy ones.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.675
Oh, yeah?

16:48.741 --> 16:51.111
(Michael)
I'm talking about doing it on
the airport luggage carousel.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.345
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.747
That was Madonna's idea of fun.
Go figure.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.383
I wrote the hook
for Borderline.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.251
Well, I actually knew
Danny's ex,

16:58.318 --> 17:00.687
and she wasn't crazy,
and she wasn't a sex maniac.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.122
She was more sex-positive
in a way

17:02.189 --> 17:03.590
that was very
on-brand for her.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.024
Ugh.
She sounds horrible.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.659
She wasn't horrible.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.328
She was super hot,
bangable,

17:08.395 --> 17:10.297
Danny loved her,
and she had huge cans.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.665
Really? I heard that she was
pear-shaped with small breasts.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.468
If anything, she was two pears
stacked on top of each other.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.704
- That's a butternut squash.
- Yeah, hot as hell.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.172
Could have sex for hours.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.307
Looks, guys,
it doesn't matter.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.674
It didn't mean anything.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.042
I mean,
she was nothing special.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.277
It was just fun.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.146
It wasn't like I was gonna
marry her or anything.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.548
Well, bottom line,
you made the right choice,

17:28.615 --> 17:31.451
because now you're with a nice
Catholic girl like Mindy.

17:31.518 --> 17:35.822
Exactly.
Now I have Mindy.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.558
Well, I am tired,
and I think I'm gonna go to bed.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.792
Next time I see you,
I'll ask you

17:39.859 --> 17:41.161
my Da Vinci Code questions.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.529
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.398
- Well, to the bunk beds.
- Good night, babe.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.269
- She's great.
- Yeah.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.839
Got any cookies or dessert
or anything like that?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.341
Main course was,
like, an hour ago.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.476
I don't know if we have
any dessert, Father.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.677
Could you make something?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.550
Give me that.
Cost me 50 bucks. Dammit.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.119
I've never been more humiliated
in my entire life.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.121
This was meant to be
my love letter to America,

18:08.188 --> 18:10.590
but it ended like every
love letter I've ever written--

18:10.657 --> 18:12.425
with the authorities
being called.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.295
Listen, listen.
I got some news for you, buddy.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.529
The New York Tim was here

18:16.596 --> 18:18.598
and they thought it was
really great.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.233
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Which critic?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.701
Was it Ben Brantley?
[gasps]

18:21.768 --> 18:23.636
Oh, my God.
Was it Alessandra Stanley?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.538
I think it was Virgil Krugg.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.740
He's the crime reporter.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.642
Said it was the best arson
he's ever seen.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.779
(Michael)
Glad you found that old
candy cane, Danny.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.780
Nom-nom-nom.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.715
Well, it was a great night,
Father.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.284
You want me to look up
the ferry for you?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.452
You know, sometimes when
parishioners have me for dinner,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.421
- they drive me home.
- Uh...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.223
But the ferry's good too,
you know?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.857
It's not too cold or wet.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.293
Great.
You'll need that.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.262
I'll just look up
that ferry for you.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.331
Is that a sonogram?

18:51.398 --> 18:52.632
That?
That's, uh--

18:52.699 --> 18:54.734
What am I talking about?
You're an OB-GYN.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.670
Of course, that's for
one of your patients.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.709
No, Father.
Look.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.512
I've been doing
a lot of lying to you,

19:05.578 --> 19:07.280
and I'm not gonna lie
about this little guy.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.250
That's my son, and Mindy's
the crazy ex-girlfriend

19:10.317 --> 19:11.418
you've been hearing
a lot about.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.554
Mindy McPherson?
My new friend?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.423
It's Lahiri,
and I asked her

19:16.489 --> 19:20.260
to lie about being
Catholic for you.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.561
Well, look at this.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.296
The little boy
who played baby Jesus

19:23.363 --> 19:25.432
in the Christmas pageant
until he was 15 years old

19:25.498 --> 19:26.599
knocks up his girlfriend.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.435
Yeah, you know what?
And there's something else.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.470
I know I was supposed
to confess all this to you,

19:30.537 --> 19:32.939
but for some reason, I don't
know why, I just couldn't.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.707
But I think it's because
when you confess,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.309
it's because you feel guilty
about something.

19:36.376 --> 19:40.613
And, Father, I don't
feel guilty about this at all.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.217
I've never been happier
about anything in my life.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.422
Well, I guess I should go.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.824
This has been the worst
night of my entire life.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.495
Uh, I'll have somebody mail you
your excommunication letter.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.564
You know you can't be buried
with your family now, right?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.232
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.967
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Father Michael!

20:01.033 --> 20:02.335
I have something to say.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.570
No more lies.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.605
Like saying you don't have
any dessert

20:05.672 --> 20:07.907
when I can see there's
a cookie jar right here!

20:07.974 --> 20:09.276
- No, no.
- Don't go in--

20:09.342 --> 20:12.579
Oh, my God!
This is the lair of Lucifer!

20:12.645 --> 20:13.946
Okay, I have a couple
things to say here.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.449
One, you gots to chill,
amigo.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.486
Second, I know that Danny
is a guilty Catholic weirdo,

20:19.552 --> 20:22.722
but his guilt is also what makes
him so kind and wonderful.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.892
And if our kid is half
that good, then I'd be happy.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.360
So I guess
what I'm saying is,

20:27.427 --> 20:31.731
I think I would like our baby
to be raised Catholic.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.633
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.568
And for the record,
you need some new blood.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.969
When we went to mass
the other day,

20:37.036 --> 20:38.505
it was like
the Crypt Keeper's wedding.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.473
- Jeez, Louise.
- Hmm.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.575
Median age is 79.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.877
Our organist died...twice.

20:44.944 --> 20:45.945
Yeah.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.847
Okay, heck.
I'll tell you what.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.982
Danny, you come to confession

20:50.049 --> 20:52.585
and we'll talk about
your absolution, all right?

20:52.652 --> 20:55.021
And you,
little disciple...

20:55.087 --> 20:58.458
I will see you
in the baptismal font.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.593
Well, my work here is done.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.762
All right, I'm gonna give these
to the Greek Orthodox.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.532
- Thank you, Father.
- Good night, Father Michael.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.666
Looks like someone's
gonna be

21:06.733 --> 21:08.301
coming to church
a lot more with me.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.802
[sighs]
How am I ever

21:09.869 --> 21:11.638
gonna get used
to the crushing boredom?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.840
Well, I have an idea.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.675
London, 1985.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.345
A little boy walks
with his father.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.646
[child voice]
Daddy, who are those dirty men?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.013
They look so sad?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.982
[adult voice]
Those are no-good miners
on strike.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.284
Throw a rock at them
or I will swat you!

21:25.352 --> 21:27.354
[normal voice]
So it was that I, Jeremy Reed,

21:27.420 --> 21:29.722
found myself a stranger
among my own people.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.790
What was I to do?
