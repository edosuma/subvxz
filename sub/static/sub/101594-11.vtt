WEBVTT

00:10.583 --> 00:12.411
One of the wells,
it blew.

00:14.631 --> 00:17.329
Anyone know who
our resident philosopher is?

00:17.373 --> 00:19.070
Wes didn't do this.

00:19.114 --> 00:20.158
How long you been
with them, Wes?

00:20.202 --> 00:21.768
I don't know who
you're talking about.

00:21.812 --> 00:23.422
Why do you like
to paint, Wes?

00:23.466 --> 00:24.945
-Where's your brother now?
-He's dead.

00:24.989 --> 00:26.077
Was your brother
with them?

00:26.121 --> 00:28.819
I don't know
who "them" is.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.995
I don't believe you!

00:31.039 --> 00:33.345
I've been thinking about
everything Virginia said

00:33.389 --> 00:35.434
about the people
that painted the messages.

00:35.478 --> 00:38.089
I heard her tell Ranger Hill
that they went underground.

00:39.699 --> 00:43.181
Death. Destruction. Decay.

00:46.967 --> 00:50.406
What is happening to the world
isn't new.

00:50.449 --> 00:53.974
The world's been breaking down
since its inception.

00:54.018 --> 00:57.108
The sun spending
its nuclear fuel.

00:57.152 --> 01:00.851
The planet spinning farther
and farther off its axis.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.027
The continents drifting apart.

01:03.071 --> 01:05.725
Ice sheets receding and melting.

01:05.769 --> 01:08.293
Forests withering and burning.

01:08.337 --> 01:11.992
Everything's winding down,
including us.

01:12.036 --> 01:16.127
Death is inevitable.
It simply is.

01:16.171 --> 01:21.132
But from this death...
comes new life.

01:21.176 --> 01:23.917
Our decaying bodies
feed the soil,

01:23.961 --> 01:27.051
and the soil, in turn,
feeds the plants.

01:27.095 --> 01:29.445
And the plants, in turn, feed us

01:29.488 --> 01:32.404
and all the creatures
that sustain us.

01:32.448 --> 01:35.059
It's the way it's always been.

01:35.103 --> 01:39.237
It's the way
it always will be.

01:39.281 --> 01:41.500
People look around
the world up there

01:41.544 --> 01:45.069
and see death
everywhere they gaze.

01:45.113 --> 01:48.594
But that's not
what's really there.

01:48.638 --> 01:50.857
If they looked hard enough,

01:50.901 --> 01:53.860
<i>if they truly looked
with open eyes,</i>

01:53.904 --> 01:56.341
<i>they would see life.</i>

01:56.385 --> 01:58.126
<i>But it's not their fault</i>

01:58.169 --> 02:00.084
<i>they don't know how
to open their eyes.</i>

02:00.128 --> 02:02.521
<i>It's not their fault --</i>

02:02.565 --> 02:06.177
<i>they're seeing the way
they always have.</i>

02:06.221 --> 02:09.180
Even after it all.

02:09.224 --> 02:12.966
<i>Even though now is the "after."</i>

02:13.010 --> 02:15.230
<i>We know the truth.</i>

02:15.273 --> 02:16.622
<i>They don't.</i>

02:16.666 --> 02:18.668
<i>We can see.</i>

02:18.711 --> 02:20.235
<i>They can't.</i>

02:20.278 --> 02:22.367
<i>So, it's incumbent upon us</i>

02:22.411 --> 02:26.676
<i>to help them be unafraid
of what's to come.</i>

02:26.719 --> 02:29.244
<i>Do you know the truth?</i>

02:29.287 --> 02:31.115
<i>Can you see?</i>

02:33.596 --> 02:37.469
<i>Can you help them be unafraid?</i>

02:41.952 --> 02:43.693
Sabrina. Hey.
Hurry up.

02:43.736 --> 02:46.130
We have new arrivals.
They're gonna be hungry.

02:46.174 --> 02:48.611
Sorry. I was just trying
to see like Teddy.

02:48.654 --> 02:49.916
And did you?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.528
<i>Death. Destruction. Decay.</i>

02:52.571 --> 02:54.269
Not yet.

02:54.312 --> 02:55.531
<i>What is happening to the world
isn't new.</i>

02:55.574 --> 02:57.924
You will.

02:57.968 --> 03:01.841
<i>The world's been breaking down
since its inception.</i>

03:01.885 --> 03:03.713
<i>The sun spending
its nuclear fuel.</i>

03:03.756 --> 03:05.018
<i>The planet...</i>

03:05.062 --> 03:07.064
Who are the new recruits?

03:07.107 --> 03:10.154
Some survivors the patrol saved
from a herd of 'posters.

03:10.198 --> 03:12.591
Teddy says they're in
really rough shape.

03:12.635 --> 03:14.245
How we looking?

03:14.289 --> 03:16.247
They're on
their way down.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.336
-And have they been checked?
-Mm-hmm.

03:24.603 --> 03:26.214
It's okay.

03:26.257 --> 03:28.520
I know you've been
through a lot,

03:28.564 --> 03:29.913
but you can come out.

03:29.956 --> 03:31.784
We're not gonna hurt you.

03:31.828 --> 03:34.570
Welcome to The Holding.

03:34.613 --> 03:37.660
I think you're
gonna like it here.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.678
Are we sure this is the place
Dakota was talking about?

03:55.721 --> 03:57.636
Oh, yeah.

04:38.503 --> 04:40.636
Why are you recording?

04:40.679 --> 04:41.811
For Teddy.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.596
Who's Teddy?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.642
He's the reason
that we're all here.

04:46.685 --> 04:48.383
<i>Who am I if not your shepherd?</i>

04:48.426 --> 04:51.516
Is he here now?

04:51.560 --> 04:54.650
His presence
is always with us.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.782
He's dead?

04:56.826 --> 04:58.393
Oh.

04:58.436 --> 05:02.484
No.
No, he's very much alive.

05:02.527 --> 05:07.315
<i>If you cannot see,
I will guide you.</i>

05:07.358 --> 05:11.841
<i>When you cannot walk,
I will carry you.</i>

05:11.884 --> 05:14.757
You know, you're lucky
we found you when we did.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.542
I'd like my weapons back.

05:17.586 --> 05:21.111
No outsiders are allowed
to carry down here.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.418
We learned that lesson
the hard way.

05:23.461 --> 05:25.550
So, w-what were you doing
on the road?

05:27.944 --> 05:30.294
Um...scavenging.

05:30.338 --> 05:32.296
You know, looking for
something to eat.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.646
Where'd you come from?

05:34.690 --> 05:37.388
A place we're never
going back to.

05:37.432 --> 05:39.347
And why is that?

05:39.390 --> 05:41.044
Does it matter?

05:41.087 --> 05:43.002
Teddy will be interested

05:43.046 --> 05:46.179
in the path that led you
to this place.

05:48.921 --> 05:51.446
<i>I have found you,</i>

05:51.489 --> 05:55.319
<i>and I will help you
see the truth.</i>

05:55.363 --> 05:58.191
<i>People look around
the world up there</i>

05:58.235 --> 06:01.238
<i>and see death everywhere
they gaze,</i>

06:01.281 --> 06:04.589
<i>but that's not
what's really there.</i>

06:04.633 --> 06:09.464
<i>If they truly looked with open
eyes, they would see life.</i>

06:11.466 --> 06:14.338
How many people
live down here?

06:14.382 --> 06:16.732
Are they allowed
to leave?

06:16.775 --> 06:18.124
What do you do for food,

06:18.168 --> 06:20.605
water, power?

06:20.649 --> 06:23.434
I was in a place like this
once before.

06:23.478 --> 06:25.610
I don't think you were ever
in a place like this.

06:25.654 --> 06:27.525
How can you be so sure?

06:27.569 --> 06:29.397
Because there is no place
like this.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.444
Because there's never been
a place like this.

06:44.324 --> 06:47.066
How long does it take them
to break down in there?

06:47.110 --> 06:48.764
Just a couple months.

06:48.807 --> 06:50.940
We take the bones out
once the flesh is gone

06:50.983 --> 06:53.638
and we make meal
for the chickens.

06:53.682 --> 06:56.685
And it's safe to eat food
that grows from this?

06:56.728 --> 06:59.165
This is how all living creatures
have been decomposing

06:59.209 --> 07:01.951
from the beginning of time.

07:01.994 --> 07:03.779
This is what
would be happening

07:03.822 --> 07:05.781
if those 'posters weren't
wandering around up there.

07:05.824 --> 07:07.783
Sorry.
"Posters"?

07:07.826 --> 07:10.046
Dead.

07:10.089 --> 07:13.353
Uh...we can come back
to that one.

07:13.397 --> 07:18.097
Food? Water? Power?
It's impressive.

07:18.141 --> 07:22.493
But it --
it also feels like...

07:22.537 --> 07:25.409
like you're preparing
for something.

07:27.019 --> 07:28.847
We found you
at the right time.

07:28.891 --> 07:31.197
I was gonna let Teddy tell you
when he returned,

07:31.241 --> 07:33.722
so you could figure out if you
wanted to stay or not...

07:33.765 --> 07:38.596
but I don't see any reason
you shouldn't know now.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.033
We're closing up the doors soon
for good.

07:41.077 --> 07:43.035
For good?

07:43.079 --> 07:44.559
Why?

07:44.602 --> 07:46.865
So we never have
to go topside again.

07:46.909 --> 07:49.477
This is the new way.
That was the old.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.828
This is where life
will begin again.

07:56.179 --> 07:59.008
-How many people live down here?
-Are they allowed to leave?

07:59.051 --> 08:01.532
-Are we allowed to leave?
-They aren't hard questions.

08:01.576 --> 08:03.882
Come on.
You gotta give me something.

08:03.926 --> 08:06.624
You know, I'm more interested
in what you have to say.

08:09.758 --> 08:13.457
There's one question
in particular that, uh,

08:13.501 --> 08:15.024
I'd like to ask.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.939
What is it?

08:19.115 --> 08:20.943
Can you see?

08:24.686 --> 08:27.166
It's the simplest one
there is.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.472
When you look at it,

08:28.516 --> 08:31.170
what do you see?

08:31.214 --> 08:34.565
-You're joking, right?
-No.

08:34.609 --> 08:36.698
Take a good look.

08:36.741 --> 08:38.700
Tell me exactly
what you see.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.578
I see a walker that
should be in the ground.

08:47.622 --> 08:49.754
Anything else?

08:52.975 --> 08:55.630
It's -- It's okay. Nobody
gets it on their first try.

08:58.197 --> 09:00.548
What's troubling you,
Alicia?

09:00.591 --> 09:03.594
Be honest.
Teddy will know if you're not.

09:03.638 --> 09:05.640
Why would he have something
to say about how I feel?

09:05.683 --> 09:07.467
Because he'll look into your eyes.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.513
And he will see the truth.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.907
He sees it in a way
no one else can.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.518
Not even you.

09:14.562 --> 09:17.347
Alright, your answers --

09:17.390 --> 09:20.829
they'll go a long way toward
earning favor with Teddy.

09:20.872 --> 09:23.788
I don't understand.
What kind of test is this?

09:23.832 --> 09:26.095
We're just trying to gauge
how much you have left to learn.

09:28.227 --> 09:29.968
This feels like a trick.

09:30.012 --> 09:31.187
You're a skeptic.

09:31.230 --> 09:33.102
We like skeptics.

09:33.145 --> 09:34.886
Why's that?

09:34.930 --> 09:36.627
Because when
we win you over,

09:36.671 --> 09:38.629
it means that you're
a true believer.

09:38.673 --> 09:40.718
You ask everybody
to do this?

09:40.762 --> 09:43.199
You know, you keep answering
my questions with questions.

09:43.242 --> 09:46.028
What kind of stuff
do people say?

09:46.071 --> 09:47.725
What are you looking
for them to say?

09:47.769 --> 09:49.771
No, there's no right
or wrong answer.

09:49.814 --> 09:52.034
Look, I don't know.
I just see an eater.

09:52.077 --> 09:53.644
Look closer.

09:57.779 --> 09:59.519
Who painted these?

09:59.563 --> 10:01.434
Why do you ask?

10:01.478 --> 10:03.393
I used to be a painter.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.351
And what did you paint?

10:05.395 --> 10:07.266
All kinds of things.

10:07.310 --> 10:10.400
I started out
copying my brother.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.619
Oh, you have a brother.

10:11.662 --> 10:12.968
Had.

10:13.011 --> 10:15.666
You were close?

10:17.537 --> 10:20.453
-His name was Nick.
-Pablo.

10:20.497 --> 10:22.412
My brother
was my best friend.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.023
I wanted
to be just like him.

10:25.067 --> 10:27.765
Why you asking me
about my family?

10:27.809 --> 10:32.204
As Teddy says, our survival
is dependent on it.

10:32.248 --> 10:34.467
Each generation
gives way to the next.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.778
You're looking at him like
he's reminding you of something.

10:40.822 --> 10:43.172
My mom, she...

10:48.046 --> 10:50.483
...she grew crops in the place
where we used to be.

10:50.527 --> 10:53.095
What happened to her?

10:56.098 --> 10:58.448
She gave her life
so we could live.

11:00.537 --> 11:03.235
Her end...

11:03.279 --> 11:04.933
was your beginning.

11:09.154 --> 11:11.940
<i>They could not see then,
and they cannot see now.</i>

11:11.983 --> 11:13.637
Anything?

11:13.681 --> 11:15.465
<i>But you can see.</i>

11:15.508 --> 11:17.554
Yeah, they're good
at not saying shit.

11:17.597 --> 11:19.121
We have to get them
to trust us.

11:19.164 --> 11:21.079
We need to get "Teddy"
to trust us.

11:21.123 --> 11:23.299
-Anyone seen him?
-He's "out on a run."

11:23.342 --> 11:25.605
Yeah. I'm sure he's plastering
his reductive bullshit

11:25.649 --> 11:27.346
wherever he can find
blank space.

11:27.390 --> 11:29.261
He's got to come back
at some point.
He will.

11:29.305 --> 11:31.133
So, meantime,
we do what we came here for.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.309
Find out everything we can...
what Virginia didn't know,

11:33.352 --> 11:34.745
why she was scared
shitless of them,

11:34.789 --> 11:36.051
and then we get
the hell out of here

11:36.094 --> 11:37.835
before they add us
to the compost heap.

11:37.879 --> 11:40.011
It could take a long time
before we find out.

11:41.926 --> 11:44.320
The others have returned.

11:45.713 --> 11:47.802
It's time
for you to meet Teddy.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.325
Come on.

11:50.761 --> 11:52.154
Coming down now.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.113
Here we go.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.048
Did we miss lunch?

12:17.092 --> 12:18.833
I'm starving.

12:18.876 --> 12:20.138
Where'd Teddy?

12:20.182 --> 12:21.313
He sent us ahead.

12:21.357 --> 12:22.750
He'll be back later.

12:24.926 --> 12:27.580
That's not him?
No.

12:27.624 --> 12:29.931
That's Derek.

12:33.021 --> 12:35.066
Derek?

12:35.110 --> 12:38.548
Wes?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.464
You're alive?

12:43.553 --> 12:45.381
What the hell, man?

12:51.561 --> 12:53.911
Oh, you're alive.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.394
So are you.

12:58.437 --> 13:00.352
Hmm? Hmm?

13:04.487 --> 13:06.532
I think we found
our way in.

13:14.323 --> 13:15.933
What?
Nothing.

13:15.977 --> 13:18.109
What?

13:18.153 --> 13:20.372
I've spent the past...

13:20.416 --> 13:22.810
I don't even know how long

13:22.853 --> 13:24.550
thinking you'd been
torn to pieces.

13:29.729 --> 13:30.774
You couldn't
have just drank

13:30.818 --> 13:32.602
your damn coffee black
that morning?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.387
Are you seriously mad that
I went looking for some creamer?

13:35.431 --> 13:37.563
No.

13:37.607 --> 13:40.392
Yes.
I-I don't know.

13:40.436 --> 13:43.787
I'm sorry, Wes.

13:43.831 --> 13:46.659
I really am.

13:46.703 --> 13:49.445
I found the condensed milk.
A whole crate of it.

13:49.488 --> 13:51.360
But when I came out of
the grocery store,

13:51.403 --> 13:52.752
a herd was coming
down the road.

13:52.796 --> 13:54.624
I got cornered.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.061
I couldn't get to my bike.
I ran into a shed and collapsed.

13:57.105 --> 13:59.847
The eaters were clawing
at the wood on top of me.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.849
I tried to get out,
but it was too heavy.

14:01.892 --> 14:03.894
I...I don't know --

14:03.938 --> 14:06.462
I guess I just passed out.

14:06.505 --> 14:07.985
I thought that was it.

14:10.596 --> 14:13.208
But when I woke up...

14:13.251 --> 14:14.905
I was here.

14:14.949 --> 14:16.907
<i>They could not see then,
and they cannot see now.</i>

14:16.951 --> 14:18.213
They saved you?

14:18.256 --> 14:20.955
Just like they saved you
topside.

14:20.998 --> 14:23.348
Why didn't you come
looking for me?

14:23.392 --> 14:25.394
I did.

14:25.437 --> 14:27.222
But you were gone.

14:30.355 --> 14:32.227
<i>Light is truth.</i>

14:32.270 --> 14:33.968
So was my bike.

14:34.011 --> 14:37.362
I --
Man, I couldn't stick around.

14:37.406 --> 14:39.495
-Uh-huh.
-And it was my only chance
to drive the damn thing.

14:39.538 --> 14:41.018
She purrs like
a kitten, right?

14:41.062 --> 14:42.672
Yeah, not anymore.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.195
Wait. What -- What happened?
Where --

14:44.239 --> 14:45.501
You don't want to know.

14:45.544 --> 14:47.633
Damn.

14:50.985 --> 14:53.509
Seems like you're running
with some good people.

14:53.552 --> 14:56.338
Yeah, things have been

14:56.381 --> 15:00.516
a...little bumpy lately,

15:00.559 --> 15:02.779
but we're headed in
the right direction.

15:02.822 --> 15:04.520
<i>Through darkness comes light.</i>

15:04.563 --> 15:06.130
<i>Through destruction...</i>

15:06.174 --> 15:07.740
You're still painting?

15:07.784 --> 15:10.961
<i>...comes life.</i>

15:11.005 --> 15:12.745
Just trying to help people
see what I see.

15:12.789 --> 15:15.313
And what is that?

15:15.357 --> 15:19.100
We were painting those messages
on tree trunks...

15:19.143 --> 15:22.364
stuff like, "If you're reading
this, you're still here."

15:22.407 --> 15:25.280
A-And your novel -- that wasn't
gonna change anything.

15:25.323 --> 15:29.980
We meant well, but
it didn't really mean anything.

15:30.024 --> 15:33.549
Teddy --
he helped me see that.

15:33.592 --> 15:36.726
But now...

15:36.769 --> 15:39.511
what I'm doing here...

15:39.555 --> 15:42.166
it means something.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.952
<i>Who am I if not your shepherd?</i>

15:44.995 --> 15:46.866
What exactly are you
doing here, Derek?

15:46.910 --> 15:49.304
<i>Who are you if not my sheep?</i>

15:51.045 --> 15:52.960
<i>You are not lost.</i>

15:53.003 --> 15:54.439
I'm not sure
you're ready for that.

15:54.483 --> 15:56.180
When will I be?

15:56.224 --> 15:59.401
When you see like I do.

15:59.444 --> 16:04.145
I got a shift
in the garden.

16:04.188 --> 16:07.496
I'll catch you at dinner.

16:07.539 --> 16:10.412
Come on.
Mm!

16:10.455 --> 16:13.589
<i>...but I will shear
the matted fur from your brow</i>

16:13.632 --> 16:15.156
<i>and help you to see.</i>

16:15.199 --> 16:18.202
<i>And if you still
won't open your eyes,</i>

16:18.246 --> 16:21.118
<i>I will open them for you.</i>

16:21.162 --> 16:22.902
<i>I will make you see.</i>

16:25.383 --> 16:29.605
<i>I will take your hand
and lead you through the fire,</i>

16:29.648 --> 16:33.913
<i>through the desert, through the
dark tunnel of destruction...</i>

16:33.957 --> 16:35.872
Be careful, Wes.

16:35.915 --> 16:39.528
He's not gonna hurt me.

16:39.571 --> 16:41.747
What about Tank Town?

16:41.791 --> 16:44.141
What they did to everyone.
What they did to you.

16:44.185 --> 16:46.709
He doesn't know about that.

16:46.752 --> 16:49.016
Did you ask him?

16:49.059 --> 16:52.454
There's no way he would do
something like that.

16:52.497 --> 16:56.197
When people are desperate, they
start believing in things --

16:56.240 --> 16:58.416
They start doing things they
never thought they would.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.813
I did.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.599
<i>...and demanding the world
look upon me and witness...</i>

17:07.643 --> 17:09.384
But Derek's different.

17:09.427 --> 17:13.344
<i>...binding their eyes,
showing them the light.</i>

17:15.651 --> 17:19.437
<i>They could not see then,
and they cannot see now.</i>

17:19.481 --> 17:22.832
<i>But you can see.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.181
<i>You see me.</i>

17:24.225 --> 17:26.053
Yeah. Um...

17:26.096 --> 17:29.056
<i>And I will help you
see the truth.</i>

17:29.099 --> 17:31.710
<i>Light is truth.</i>

17:31.754 --> 17:35.410
<i>Darkness is false.</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:42.417
So, what did
your brother say?

17:42.460 --> 17:44.201
Not much.

17:44.245 --> 17:48.597
He said he wouldn't tell me
until I could "see" like him.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.165
He's probably waiting to see
if he can trust us.

17:51.208 --> 17:55.125
You know,
maybe these people

17:55.169 --> 17:57.040
aren't the threat that
we thought they were.

17:57.084 --> 17:58.737
No. Listen to me,
alright?

17:58.781 --> 18:00.652
Maybe it wasn't about us.

18:00.696 --> 18:02.393
Maybe it was about Virginia.

18:02.437 --> 18:05.527
Maybe they were trying to
take her out just like we were.

18:05.570 --> 18:08.617
Or maybe Virginia was just
trying to make us paranoid

18:08.660 --> 18:10.358
on her way out.

18:10.401 --> 18:13.274
We've known this is about more
than just Virginia.

18:13.317 --> 18:15.667
Nora's people --
what happened in the tower.

18:15.711 --> 18:17.756
They set that up.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.802
Well, there's one way
to find out.

18:19.845 --> 18:21.499
How's that?

18:21.543 --> 18:23.022
I ask him.

18:23.066 --> 18:25.068
I...

18:25.112 --> 18:27.636
How are you guys
settling in?

18:27.679 --> 18:29.986
Good.
Good.

18:30.029 --> 18:32.119
It takes a little while
to get used to not knowing

18:32.162 --> 18:35.774
if it's day or night, but, uh,
the food makes up for it?

18:35.818 --> 18:37.559
Mm-hmm. Mm.

18:37.602 --> 18:39.343
You're Alicia, right?

18:39.387 --> 18:40.866
Yeah.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.346
Wes tells me
you pulled him

18:42.390 --> 18:44.043
through a rough patch
after I left.

18:44.087 --> 18:46.872
Mm.
Oh, I mean...

18:46.916 --> 18:49.310
Yeah, he helped
me out, too.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.448
What is it?

18:57.492 --> 18:59.711
Nothing.

18:59.755 --> 19:02.105
Just go to go topside
for a bit.

19:02.149 --> 19:05.064
Make sure you try
the rhubarb pie.

19:11.201 --> 19:13.725
<i>When you cannot walk,
I will carry you.</i>

19:16.206 --> 19:17.990
What the hell was that?

19:18.034 --> 19:21.080
You know where
Derek's bunk is?

19:21.124 --> 19:23.126
Yeah.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.562
Let's skip
dessert tonight.

19:43.364 --> 19:44.756
Anything?

19:44.800 --> 19:46.497
Just the paint.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.988
You hear that?

20:01.730 --> 20:03.819
What the hell?

20:03.862 --> 20:05.255
I don't know, Al.

20:05.299 --> 20:08.040
But c'mon,
he could come back any time.

20:08.084 --> 20:10.608
No, there's gotta
be something.

20:24.535 --> 20:26.058
Al.

20:32.021 --> 20:34.023
Where the hell
did they get these?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.243
What are they?

20:36.286 --> 20:39.637
Something they
shouldn't have.

20:39.681 --> 20:41.291
Does it mean something
to you?

20:41.335 --> 20:43.641
Yeah. Long story.

20:51.432 --> 20:53.434
Wes...

20:56.393 --> 21:00.702
It was about more
than just Ginny.

21:00.745 --> 21:03.313
Your brother --
everyone here --

21:03.357 --> 21:05.663
they're trying to do
as much damage as they can.

21:05.707 --> 21:07.665
Oh.
We don't know that.

21:09.711 --> 21:11.060
Look.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.062
These coordinates.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.977
That's Tank Town.

21:16.848 --> 21:18.676
T-That doesn't
mean anything.

21:22.941 --> 21:25.466
This does.

21:25.509 --> 21:28.860
Logs of when Virginia was
sending people to Tank Town.

21:28.904 --> 21:31.210
They were keeping track.

21:33.212 --> 21:35.389
The other
settlements, too.

21:35.432 --> 21:39.958
I'm not saying Derek
knew you were there,

21:40.002 --> 21:41.830
but he knew what
they were doing.

21:47.966 --> 21:49.925
I'm...

21:49.968 --> 21:53.232
I'm sorry.

21:56.497 --> 21:58.325
Derek thinks these people
are helping him

21:58.368 --> 22:00.544
see things more clearly,
but they're not.

22:04.113 --> 22:05.854
I have to make him see
what's really going on.

22:07.464 --> 22:09.336
How are
you gonna do that?

22:11.947 --> 22:14.079
We have to get him
out of here.

22:35.753 --> 22:37.712
You did it.

22:37.755 --> 22:40.410
Did what?

22:40.454 --> 22:43.935
Those places -- you set up
the attacks on them.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.816
How do you know that?

22:54.859 --> 22:56.905
Doesn't matter.

22:56.948 --> 22:58.994
Why did you do it?

22:59.037 --> 23:00.822
You won't understand.

23:00.865 --> 23:03.433
You're not ready.
Why not?

23:03.477 --> 23:06.349
I told you.
Because you can't see.

23:06.393 --> 23:08.482
But it's okay.

23:08.525 --> 23:11.485
I couldn't see either --
not until I met Teddy.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.051
How did he convince you

23:13.095 --> 23:15.010
killing people was
the right thing to do?

23:15.053 --> 23:17.316
We have to start over.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.927
And we can't do that

23:18.970 --> 23:20.842
till everyone and everything
up there is gone.

23:23.845 --> 23:25.455
Does that include me?

23:27.196 --> 23:29.024
What are you
talking about?

23:29.067 --> 23:31.461
I was at the oil fields.

23:34.595 --> 23:37.380
I got hit with shrapnel.

23:37.424 --> 23:38.816
I never felt such pain
in my life.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.340
Wes...

23:41.384 --> 23:43.560
I almost died.

23:43.604 --> 23:45.475
I lost friends.
People I cared about.

23:45.519 --> 23:48.173
I didn't know.
And if you did?

23:48.217 --> 23:49.479
Would that have changed
anything?

23:49.523 --> 23:50.741
I would have
gotten you out.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.482
But you still
would've done it.

23:52.526 --> 23:54.658
You would have killed
those people?

23:54.702 --> 23:56.486
It's what Teddy wants.

23:56.530 --> 23:59.446
Man, I don't give a damn about
what "Teddy" wants.

23:59.489 --> 24:02.840
What the hell
do you want, man?!

24:02.884 --> 24:07.062
People died, Derek.

24:07.105 --> 24:09.020
You killed them.

24:09.064 --> 24:10.369
What do you think
about that?

24:10.413 --> 24:13.285
Good people --
innocent people.

24:13.329 --> 24:15.766
What you did --
you did, Derek -- killed them.

24:18.116 --> 24:21.250
Alright, I-I know you.
I know you.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.295
And this, it ain't you.

24:23.339 --> 24:25.428
It ain't you.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.824
Come with us.

24:32.957 --> 24:34.655
Those places up there...

24:34.698 --> 24:37.527
Mm-hmm.

24:37.571 --> 24:39.616
...they're about
how we used to live.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.837
This -- This is how
I want to live now.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.579
The place I'm from.
It's not about the past.

24:45.622 --> 24:47.494
It's about how things
are going to be.

24:47.537 --> 24:50.279
And Morgan?
Yo, he's not like this Teddy.

24:50.322 --> 24:54.283
He won't make you do anything
you don't want to.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.198
Morgan?

24:56.241 --> 24:57.852
Morgan Jones.

24:57.895 --> 25:00.463
The guy who started it.
I-I think you'd like him.

25:02.552 --> 25:04.206
What about Virginia?

25:04.249 --> 25:06.164
She's dead.

25:06.208 --> 25:11.213
Yeah, Morgan...he helped us
bring her down.

25:11.256 --> 25:12.910
Where is it?

25:12.954 --> 25:14.738
-Are you gonna come or not?
-Where is it?

25:14.782 --> 25:16.305
Does it matter?

25:16.348 --> 25:19.090
These people aren't
helping you see, Derek.

25:19.134 --> 25:20.527
They're blinding you.

25:25.706 --> 25:28.970
You're lost.

25:29.013 --> 25:33.278
You're so lost, I know you
probably won't come with me.

25:33.322 --> 25:35.324
To do the things
that you did...

25:43.201 --> 25:46.422
But I'm your brother.

25:46.465 --> 25:49.251
Alright?
You just gotta trust me, man.

25:51.732 --> 25:54.473
You want a new beginning?

25:54.517 --> 25:56.693
You can have it, man.
We both can.

25:56.737 --> 25:59.478
All you have to do
is come with us.

26:01.002 --> 26:02.525
Right --
Right over there.

26:02.569 --> 26:04.222
Oh!

26:04.266 --> 26:05.093
Told you.

26:07.225 --> 26:10.968
If they catch me
trying to leave...

26:11.012 --> 26:13.014
they'll kill me.

26:13.057 --> 26:16.844
They'll kill all of you.

26:22.327 --> 26:24.634
Then let's not get caught.

26:35.819 --> 26:38.256
We can get out of the city,
travel off the main roads...

26:38.300 --> 26:40.171
they won't find us.

26:40.215 --> 26:42.565
We need weapons, food.

26:42.609 --> 26:44.567
Dwight and I had
an emergency drop

26:44.611 --> 26:46.613
a few miles south
of the city

26:46.656 --> 26:48.527
when we were working
for Virginia.

26:53.097 --> 26:54.621
What's in the bag?

26:56.100 --> 26:58.059
Maps.
Coordinates.

26:58.102 --> 27:01.366
The places we're -- <i>
they're</i> planning to hit next.

27:05.196 --> 27:07.459
You're bringing them?

27:07.503 --> 27:10.593
So nobody else gets hurt.

27:22.344 --> 27:24.302
Wait, Alicia!

27:24.346 --> 27:25.434
Sorry, Wes.
I can't take the chance.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.001
What are you talking about?

27:27.044 --> 27:30.221
Not after what happened
with Dakota. Let's go.

27:30.265 --> 27:31.222
Wes, let's go.

27:31.266 --> 27:32.441
I'm not leaving him.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.225
We can't trust him.

27:34.269 --> 27:36.271
Just because you got screwed
over by Dakota and Strand

27:36.314 --> 27:37.968
doesn't mean my brother's
gonna do the same.

27:38.012 --> 27:39.317
Alicia, we gotta go.

27:39.361 --> 27:41.058
That's not what's
happening, okay?

27:41.102 --> 27:43.713
It's not the same thing.
We have to be careful.

27:43.757 --> 27:45.715
We can come back for him,
but right now,

27:45.759 --> 27:47.848
we have everything we need
to take them down.

27:47.891 --> 27:49.632
We know where they are
and we know the places

27:49.676 --> 27:51.634
that they're gonna hit,
so let's go.

27:51.678 --> 27:54.071
Okay?

27:54.115 --> 27:55.856
You're not going anywhere.

28:03.298 --> 28:06.780
Hey! Wait!

28:06.823 --> 28:08.738
Get your hands off of me!

28:08.782 --> 28:10.958
Where's my brother?!
What are you doing to him?!

28:16.485 --> 28:17.834
What the hell is this?

28:19.880 --> 28:22.143
It's embalming equipment.
They hit the funeral home.

28:22.186 --> 28:24.275
You won't decay.

28:24.319 --> 28:26.060
You won't return
to the earth.

28:26.103 --> 28:28.366
You won't be part of
our new beginning.

28:28.410 --> 28:30.325
It doesn't have to be
like this.

28:30.368 --> 28:33.023
Just tell us where we can
find Morgan Jones.

28:35.069 --> 28:36.897
How do you know Morgan?

28:36.940 --> 28:39.900
Where is he?

28:39.943 --> 28:41.902
Where's the place
he set up?

28:41.945 --> 28:43.555
We know it's not out of
Virginia's settlements.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.821
All right, who's first?

28:56.090 --> 28:58.657
-Hey! Hey!
-No! Hey!

29:10.931 --> 29:13.237
Your brother thought
you'd be more cooperative.

29:17.198 --> 29:19.287
Wes --

29:19.330 --> 29:20.375
answer him.

29:20.418 --> 29:21.506
He will kill you.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.508
What the hell, Derek?

29:26.424 --> 29:29.819
Alicia was right.
You were playing us.

29:29.863 --> 29:32.735
Only when you said
you were with Morgan.

29:32.779 --> 29:34.302
You were playing us, too.

29:34.345 --> 29:36.957
I was trying to help you.
To get you out of here.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.568
-I don't want to leave.
-But --

29:39.611 --> 29:42.440
I told you --
what I'm doing here --

29:42.484 --> 29:43.746
it means something.

29:43.790 --> 29:45.530
What?
What is it?

29:45.574 --> 29:47.837
I'm trying to understand.

29:47.881 --> 29:51.188
This -- This is where
you need to be.

29:51.232 --> 29:54.626
Without any idea of what to do
or what it means.

29:54.670 --> 29:56.150
That's when
I saw the truth.

29:56.193 --> 30:00.807
I believe
you can see it, too.

30:00.850 --> 30:03.157
Let's go find out.

30:22.176 --> 30:23.438
<i>...is inevitable.</i>

30:23.481 --> 30:25.179
<i>It simply is.</i>

30:26.789 --> 30:28.878
Tell me what you see.

30:28.922 --> 30:31.881
<i>...comes new life.</i>

30:34.405 --> 30:36.930
I need to ask
one question first.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.411
<i>...and the soil, in turn...</i>

30:40.455 --> 30:44.024
You had people
at the oil fields.

30:44.067 --> 30:46.069
They had to have been
reporting back to you.

30:46.113 --> 30:48.376
That's the only way
you could've pulled that off.

30:48.419 --> 30:51.858
<i>The way it always has been,
the way it always will be.</i>

30:53.642 --> 30:55.557
Did you know I was there?

30:55.600 --> 30:59.082
<i>...everywhere they gaze.</i>

30:59.126 --> 31:02.172
People are people, Wes.

31:02.216 --> 31:05.132
<i>If they looked hard enough,</i>

31:05.175 --> 31:09.179
<i>if they truly looked
with open eyes...</i>

31:09.223 --> 31:12.052
Now tell me what you see.

31:18.928 --> 31:23.280
I see someone
who's just like him.

31:23.324 --> 31:26.414
Someone who's still walking
even though he's dead inside.

31:30.331 --> 31:33.551
That's exactly how I felt.

31:33.595 --> 31:36.337
I wasn't talking about me.

31:44.171 --> 31:45.912
Don't.

32:06.106 --> 32:08.238
Please.

32:08.282 --> 32:09.718
Don't.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.067
Please.

32:11.111 --> 32:13.069
Don't.

32:19.902 --> 32:21.469
Ohh!

32:24.559 --> 32:25.560
<i>When you cannot walk...</i>

32:29.390 --> 32:31.261
Oh, God...

32:39.791 --> 32:44.100
<i>They could not see then,
and they cannot see now.</i>

32:44.144 --> 32:46.755
<i>But you can see.</i>

32:46.798 --> 32:50.150
<i>You see me.</i>

32:50.193 --> 32:52.282
I loved you, man.

32:52.326 --> 32:54.937
<i>And I will help you
see the truth.</i>

32:54.981 --> 32:57.592
<i>The tunnel is long and dark,
my friends.</i>

32:57.635 --> 33:00.334
<i>Many comrades will be lost
along the way.</i>

33:05.774 --> 33:07.950
I loved you.

33:07.994 --> 33:11.084
<i>Through the darkness
comes light.</i>

33:15.958 --> 33:18.134
What the hell?

33:18.178 --> 33:19.657
Do it.

33:19.701 --> 33:21.616
No. No! No!
Wait!

33:21.659 --> 33:24.227
Wait! Wait!
No!

33:24.271 --> 33:26.229
Let her go.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.322
Where's Derek?

33:36.457 --> 33:38.328
I'm sorry.

33:38.372 --> 33:40.983
Me, too.

33:41.027 --> 33:43.029
Now, back away.

33:52.429 --> 33:54.431
You're the one who convinced me
people are capable

33:54.475 --> 33:56.346
of doing more than
saving their own skin.

33:56.390 --> 33:58.348
We're not gonna
get past them?

33:58.392 --> 34:00.307
We don't have to!

34:03.266 --> 34:05.225
Get it open!

34:05.268 --> 34:07.401
Man #Open up!

34:07.444 --> 34:09.142
We got a couple
minutes tops.

34:09.185 --> 34:11.100
Alicia!

34:11.144 --> 34:13.929
-Hey, Al.
-Get it open! Come on!

34:13.972 --> 34:15.713
Push!
Get it open, now!

34:16.671 --> 34:18.803
Shit.

34:36.865 --> 34:38.823
They're all embalmed.

34:45.134 --> 34:46.831
Head over there.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.485
We can do this.

34:48.529 --> 34:50.661
Their jaws are wired shut.
We just have to be fast.

34:52.272 --> 34:53.751
Open the door!

35:06.460 --> 35:09.898
Break it down.
Break it down!

35:11.117 --> 35:13.945
Get the door open.
Get it open!

35:20.648 --> 35:22.519
Al.

35:22.563 --> 35:24.695
Go ahead.

35:27.611 --> 35:29.787
Al, don't.

35:39.580 --> 35:41.147
What the hell
was that about?

35:41.190 --> 35:43.236
-It's opening!
-Get in there!

35:43.279 --> 35:45.107
Keep going.
We're almost there.

35:45.151 --> 35:47.892
Keep pushing!
Keep going!

35:47.936 --> 35:50.199
Yo, we need
a distraction.

35:50.243 --> 35:51.896
We need to
take this place down.

35:51.940 --> 35:54.160
-Embalming fluid's flammable.
-It's in there.

35:54.203 --> 35:56.858
No, no, no.
I-It's in here, too.

36:00.775 --> 36:02.516
I have an idea.

36:04.387 --> 36:05.693
We need help with the door!

36:05.736 --> 36:07.869
Here, go.
I got this.

36:10.132 --> 36:11.612
Let me do this.

36:11.655 --> 36:13.222
Go. You need to
get those maps to Morgan.

36:13.266 --> 36:14.615
But, Alicia --You said I made you believe

36:14.658 --> 36:16.617
people could do more.
They can.

36:16.660 --> 36:18.923
Let's go!

36:18.967 --> 36:20.447
We can't
just leave her.

36:20.490 --> 36:21.883
You can.

36:23.754 --> 36:25.713
Go.
I'm right behind you.

37:17.808 --> 37:19.419
How bad was the fire?

37:19.462 --> 37:22.248
Bad --
she might have gotten out.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.597
She might not.
We don't know.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.555
The rest of them?

37:25.599 --> 37:27.557
Some of them got away.

37:27.601 --> 37:29.385
How many?
It's hard to say.

37:29.429 --> 37:32.127
All we could see was fire.

37:34.042 --> 37:36.087
You said they were
planning something.

37:36.131 --> 37:37.698
Something big.

37:37.741 --> 37:40.091
Big enough to keep them
down there for a long time.

37:42.920 --> 37:46.184
Morgan,
they knew who you were.

37:46.228 --> 37:48.230
They were trying
to find you.

37:48.274 --> 37:50.058
Any idea why?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.278
I don't.

37:52.321 --> 37:54.845
Whatever they're doing,
it's not gonna happen.

37:54.889 --> 37:56.412
We'll stop them.

37:56.456 --> 37:58.806
First we gotta do what
we can for Alicia.

37:58.849 --> 38:00.895
Hey, do -- do we have
any gas left?

38:00.938 --> 38:03.332
No, but the horses
are fed and watered.

38:03.376 --> 38:05.029
I want to help.

38:08.294 --> 38:09.469
No.

38:11.427 --> 38:13.168
I wouldn't be
standing here

38:13.211 --> 38:14.648
if Alicia didn't stick
her neck out for me.

38:14.691 --> 38:16.650
I'm the reason
you went there.

38:16.693 --> 38:18.652
Just let me finish
what I started.

38:18.695 --> 38:20.915
For Alicia.

38:20.958 --> 38:22.308
For all of you.

38:24.701 --> 38:29.140
Appreciate what you've done,
but we're not there yet.

38:29.184 --> 38:31.839
So, we start with
the parking garage --

38:31.882 --> 38:34.320
we track whoever's left
from there.

38:51.685 --> 38:53.339
Hey.

38:57.517 --> 38:59.257
You all right?

38:59.301 --> 39:01.695
The places they
were targeting --

39:01.738 --> 39:04.524
I don't think they were after
Nora and her people.

39:04.567 --> 39:08.354
These maps have drop sights
all over the region.

39:08.397 --> 39:11.792
If they hit a chopper, they
could take out a lot of people.

39:11.835 --> 39:13.924
Beer lady?

39:16.057 --> 39:18.886
I have to find her,
warn her.

39:18.929 --> 39:21.192
Who knows?
Maybe they can help us.

39:24.935 --> 39:27.503
Beats chasing her
by walkie.

39:30.463 --> 39:35.772
I actually thought I lost...
beer lady.

39:35.816 --> 39:38.775
Look, I get it.

39:38.819 --> 39:42.039
If -- If you don't check in
with me every couple days --

39:42.083 --> 39:44.128
come looking for you.

39:45.782 --> 39:47.567
I know.

40:16.987 --> 40:19.076
What the hell is this?

40:20.469 --> 40:23.472
Why are you
keeping me here?

40:23.516 --> 40:26.823
Our decaying bodies
feed the soil.

40:26.867 --> 40:29.347
The soil, in turn,
feeds the plants.

40:29.391 --> 40:32.263
Out of death
springs new life.

40:32.307 --> 40:34.527
For most.

40:34.570 --> 40:37.399
Not for you.

40:37.443 --> 40:40.968
Now, you, we're going to
preserve exactly as you are.

40:41.011 --> 40:43.013
Don't come any closer.

40:49.977 --> 40:51.892
Get her ready.

40:51.935 --> 40:54.372
I have a feeling Teddy will
want to do this himself.

41:06.950 --> 41:09.823
This'll go a lot faster
if you cooperate.

41:16.090 --> 41:18.179
Aah!

41:26.492 --> 41:27.754
No!

41:42.769 --> 41:45.293
Aah!

41:57.348 --> 42:00.047
Ohh!

42:49.662 --> 42:52.055
Would you give us a moment,
please, Riley?

43:02.762 --> 43:06.722
So, you're the...
King of the Crazies.

43:08.681 --> 43:10.770
And you are Alicia.

43:10.813 --> 43:14.121
I never gave you my name.

43:14.164 --> 43:15.688
Your voice.

43:15.731 --> 43:17.559
Oh, I've been
listening to you.

43:17.603 --> 43:20.344
Riley made a --
a -- a recording

43:20.388 --> 43:22.129
when you first arrived.

43:24.087 --> 43:26.394
Back off.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.048
You know,
if I meant you harm,

43:28.091 --> 43:30.616
we would not be having
this conversation.

43:30.659 --> 43:33.575
Now, you, uh...
you gave yourself up

43:33.619 --> 43:37.144
so your friends could escape --
is that right?

43:37.187 --> 43:38.972
They left you.

43:39.015 --> 43:40.408
I made them.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.192
And they obliged.

43:42.236 --> 43:43.716
Some family.

43:43.759 --> 43:47.110
You know, family
should be sacred.

43:47.154 --> 43:50.070
It is, after all, the beginning
of each and every one of us.

43:50.113 --> 43:53.029
Question -- did you
sacrifice yourself

43:53.073 --> 43:55.205
because you are noble...

43:55.249 --> 43:59.514
or because you're punishing
yourself for something?

43:59.557 --> 44:02.386
Or perhaps
you're just following

44:02.430 --> 44:03.866
in the footsteps
of your mother.

44:11.221 --> 44:15.530
Look, I don't care
what you think or what you say.

44:15.573 --> 44:19.316
Whatever it is,
let's just get to it.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.970
It's all right.

44:21.014 --> 44:24.495
I'm a bit of a
mama's boy myself.

44:24.539 --> 44:27.020
No, I think there's
a lot we could learn

44:27.063 --> 44:28.848
from -- from each other.

44:28.891 --> 44:33.635
I'm not buying any of this shit
you're selling!

44:33.679 --> 44:35.419
Okay?

44:35.463 --> 44:37.857
What's next?
You want to kill me?

44:39.467 --> 44:41.295
That's not gonna happen.

44:44.602 --> 44:46.953
Now, you and the folks
you came here with

44:46.996 --> 44:50.696
destroyed everything
we have been working toward.

44:50.739 --> 44:52.698
Years of work.

44:52.741 --> 44:55.483
Sacrifices literal and figurative.

44:55.526 --> 44:59.313
You destroyed it!

44:59.356 --> 45:01.881
But, uh, someone else in
my position might find that,

45:01.924 --> 45:05.145
um, unforgivable.

45:08.017 --> 45:11.281
But I believe that
if one lives by the sword...

45:11.325 --> 45:14.763
well, you know how
the rest of it goes.

45:14.807 --> 45:18.332
For every ending
springs a new beginning.

45:18.375 --> 45:22.249
What do you want?

45:24.512 --> 45:27.297
To save you, Alicia.

45:37.090 --> 45:39.570
I don't need saving.

45:41.877 --> 45:44.837
I know you don't
believe in this,

45:44.880 --> 45:47.753
in us...

45:47.796 --> 45:49.624
yet.

45:49.667 --> 45:53.280
But you will.

45:53.323 --> 45:54.890
Oh, I've been looking

45:54.934 --> 45:57.023
for someone like you
for a long, long time.
