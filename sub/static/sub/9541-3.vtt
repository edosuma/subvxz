00:20.988 --> 00:22.756
You realize you were speeding.

00:22.824 --> 00:26.159
Yes. Yes, I do, officer.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.095
Ok. As long as you know.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.465
On your way, then.
Drive safely.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.633
What the...

00:36.537 --> 00:39.306
All right, you. Pull over.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.243
Uh, e-excuse me.

00:43.311 --> 00:46.813
A-are you aware
that you're speeding?

00:53.621 --> 00:56.123
Aah! Oh!

01:38.199 --> 01:40.200
- Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:46.574 --> 01:48.441
Thanks for coming along, gang.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.011
I really need the support.
It's never a good thing

01:51.078 --> 01:53.246
When my dad asks me
to meet at his office.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.215
Like, dude, no problemo.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.317
Yeah. No problemo.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.953
Too bad Daphne couldn't
make it. Trust me.

02:00.021 --> 02:02.222
She'd love to be here for you
if she could.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.157
Ah, Fred, my boy.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.660
Today is a very exciting day
for you,

02:06.727 --> 02:10.096
Because today you learn
the family business... politics!

02:10.163 --> 02:12.699
Politics? That's adult stuff.

02:12.767 --> 02:16.269
You know, kids my age are into
traps and solving mysteries.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.938
No, they're not, son.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.907
You're going to learn all the vital
things I do for this community,

02:20.975 --> 02:22.909
Like create pamphlets
and strategize

02:22.977 --> 02:24.945
About new places
to put parking meters.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.414
I know a place he can put
another parking meter.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.583
Fine. What do you want
me to do?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.518
Help me get reelected as Mayor.

02:31.586 --> 02:35.088
Make me 40,000 copies
of this campaign pamphlet.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.967
Ohh. Fred is just going
to adore this new ascot.

02:47.969 --> 02:49.903
Darling, could you
come downstairs?

02:49.971 --> 02:52.706
There's someone your mother and
I would like for you to meet.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.142
I'd like you to meet
Rung Ladderton,

02:56.210 --> 03:00.580
Heir to
the Ladderton ladder company.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.049
Um, hello.
Nice to meet you.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.318
Yes. Yes, it is.

03:08.089 --> 03:11.491
It's a little promotional
pendant I like to hand out.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.093
Oh. Thanks.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.195
But I already have a pendant.

03:16.831 --> 03:19.833
Anyway, give me a jingle, and we'll
plan a magical night on the town.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.936
Oh, yeah. The life of the seventh
largest regional ladder manufacturer

03:23.004 --> 03:24.271
Never stops.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.440
Sorry, but I gotta "rung."
heh heh.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.609
- Heh heh heh.
- Ho ho ho! "Rung."

03:29.677 --> 03:32.779
Just adorable.

03:32.847 --> 03:36.516
Oh, my gosh, he is just
perfect for you, pumpkin.

03:36.584 --> 03:40.120
Wait. Are you trying
to set me up with...Him?

03:40.187 --> 03:41.888
What about Fred?

03:41.956 --> 03:44.724
You're just friends, right?

03:44.792 --> 03:48.094
Well, yeah,
but we're really good friends.

03:48.162 --> 03:51.164
And I don't know.
It feels like cheating...

03:51.232 --> 03:54.668
On a friend.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.004
Darling, think of it like
trying a new cut of meat.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.006
Why have ground beef

04:00.074 --> 04:02.709
When you can have
a nice prime rib?

04:02.777 --> 04:05.845
But I don't even like meat.
I like vegetables.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.048
Like Fred.

04:08.115 --> 04:12.152
All we're asking you to do,
dear, is give Rung a chance.

04:15.056 --> 04:16.790
Don't worry, Freddy.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.658
We'll get your dad
elected again,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.560
And you'll be back
to solving mysteries

04:20.628 --> 04:22.062
In no time. Ha!

04:22.129 --> 04:25.732
Vote for Fred Sr.
Vote for Fred Sr.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.718
Heh. Heh.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.320
Look what you've done
to my new suit!

04:52.827 --> 04:54.594
- Uh-oh. Heh heh.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.162
Vote for Fred Sr.?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.765
What's the problem here,
Avocados?

04:58.833 --> 05:00.967
- That's Avoc-ados.

05:01.035 --> 05:04.637
And if you want to run a dirty campaign,
Jones, two can play at that game.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.573
Gee, dad.
Who was that guy?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.809
George Avocados,
the person I'm running against.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.178
He considers himself
a shoo-in for the job

05:12.246 --> 05:15.682
Because his father Theodore
Avocados was Mayor once,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.952
Until he was caught stealing a priceless
diamond from Crystal Cove bank.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.787
Jinkies. What happened?

05:20.855 --> 05:23.857
The diamond was never found,
but Theodore went to jail.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.694
George has claimed his
father's innocence ever since.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.431
We sure missed you today, Daph.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.067
Is everything ok at home?
Sure. Yeah. Of course.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.903
That's a weird question.

05:36.971 --> 05:39.472
Oh, boy.
After all that campaigning,

05:39.540 --> 05:42.208
I can't wait to dig into
a triple clam pizza

05:42.276 --> 05:43.977
At the clam cabin.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.613
Yeah. I'm with you, Raggy.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.221
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

05:55.289 --> 05:57.190
Hmm? Hmm.

05:57.258 --> 05:59.492
Hey. There's no doorknob.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.129
Oh! Now we can't get in!

06:03.197 --> 06:04.731
Oh, boy.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.333
Like, my stomach gets very
grumpy when I don't feed it.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.869
We be all closed!

06:12.840 --> 06:15.608
Someone stole
me crystal doorknobs,

06:15.676 --> 06:19.479
Just like that clam
who stole me nose!

06:23.250 --> 06:25.018
That's kind of weird.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.320
Who'd want to steal doorknobs?

06:27.388 --> 06:30.990
You know, shag, I have plenty
of food back at my place.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.127
Um, like, thanks, Velma,

06:34.195 --> 06:36.429
But scooby-Doo has had his
tongue tattooed with a map

06:36.497 --> 06:38.765
Of ever single pizza joint
in town.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.501
As you can see,
we got it covered.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.939
Yeah, in drool.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.941
You know, I heard someone stole

06:48.008 --> 06:50.076
All the crystal doorknobs
at school.

06:50.144 --> 06:53.613
My mom and dad said they were
missing at the haunted museum, too.

07:00.221 --> 07:03.456
Somebody should tell the nut there
driving that truck to dial it back.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.291
Ow!

07:05.359 --> 07:07.193
Zoiks!

07:39.071 --> 07:41.739
Guys, we're not
falling anymore.

07:44.142 --> 07:46.644
Jeez. Talk about
a lucky break.

07:50.315 --> 07:52.083
Not that lucky!

08:07.032 --> 08:08.232
Unh!

08:09.935 --> 08:11.202
Huh?

08:13.605 --> 08:15.773
Whew.

08:17.276 --> 08:19.477
It was huge,
and it had flaming tires.

08:19.544 --> 08:22.813
And it went, "honk!"

08:22.881 --> 08:24.982
And then it went that way,
and then it went that way,

08:25.050 --> 08:26.851
And then went...

08:26.918 --> 08:30.855
All right. So, you're saying this
ghost truck disappeared like a, uh...

08:30.922 --> 08:32.123
Ghost truck.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.457
Yep, that's pretty much it.

08:34.525 --> 08:38.629
Well. Looks like you
kids might have stumbled onto a new

08:38.697 --> 08:40.464
Tourist attraction.

08:40.532 --> 08:43.567
Tourist attraction?
Like, man, it nearly dumped us in the cove.

08:43.635 --> 08:46.404
Besides... we're not
even sure it was a ghost.

08:46.471 --> 08:47.705
I'm sorry.

08:47.773 --> 08:50.374
But didn't you say
there was no driver?

08:50.442 --> 08:53.711
That's textbook ghost truck.
Case closed.

08:55.013 --> 08:56.981
Hey. Where's Fred?

08:57.049 --> 08:59.450
Over here.
I think I found something.

08:59.518 --> 09:01.819
Daphne, let me borrow
your camera phone.

09:06.591 --> 09:09.760
Yup. The phone's low res camera
brightened the contrast.

09:09.828 --> 09:12.063
You see what I see, gang?

09:12.130 --> 09:13.898
Tire tracks!

09:13.965 --> 09:16.767
What kind of ghost truck
leaves tire tracks?

09:16.835 --> 09:19.370
Add to that a bunch
of missing crystal doorknobs,

09:19.438 --> 09:22.273
And we've got one seriously
weird mystery on our hands.

09:24.109 --> 09:26.010
Hello. Daphne's phone.

09:26.078 --> 09:27.511
Daphne. Rung here.

09:27.579 --> 09:29.313
Yeah, I must have missed
your call. Anyway,

09:29.381 --> 09:31.515
Our date is on for tomorrow
night at the bloody stake.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.818
Oh. Um, well, uh...

09:33.885 --> 09:36.620
Please, contain your excitement, ok?
I'll see you there.

09:36.688 --> 09:39.223
- Freddy, I can explain.
- Oh, no need!

09:39.291 --> 09:42.226
This Rung guy really sounds cool
and fun, too.

09:42.294 --> 09:45.830
What?! I mean,
you want me to go?

09:45.897 --> 09:48.232
Of course.
I love the bloody stake.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.402
Make sure and get the voit de
impaler curse chicken and rice.

09:51.470 --> 09:53.404
It's to die.

09:56.575 --> 09:59.310
Check it out. The doorknobs
are missing here, too.

09:59.378 --> 10:01.212
Typical.

10:01.279 --> 10:04.181
I assure you there will be
no shortage of doorknobs

10:04.249 --> 10:07.051
When George Avoc-ados
is Mayor.

10:07.119 --> 10:10.221
Missing doorknobs
mean angry voters.

10:13.125 --> 10:17.061
That Avocados guy
gives me the creeps.

10:17.129 --> 10:18.729
Creeps? Creeps?

10:18.797 --> 10:20.531
Where are the creeps?

10:20.599 --> 10:24.402
- Calm down, scooby-Doo.
It's just, like, a figure of speech.

10:24.469 --> 10:27.371
I don't know.
Maybe Scooby's onto something.

10:27.439 --> 10:30.975
After all, it's Avocados who
benefits from the missing doorknobs.

10:31.042 --> 10:32.777
Good point.
Maybe it's time

10:32.844 --> 10:36.781
We set a little trap
for Crystal Cove's knob stealer.

10:40.752 --> 10:44.221
Too bad Daphne had to miss
all the fun setting up these traps.

10:44.289 --> 10:47.958
Yeah. But I'll bet she's
having a great time on her date.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.627
Hello?

10:49.694 --> 10:51.295
We got some news, baby.

10:51.363 --> 10:53.631
The tires that made the treads
on the highway

10:53.698 --> 10:56.500
Were only sold to 2 people
in Crystal Cove...

10:56.568 --> 10:59.804
G. Nurno Treddal
and George Avocados.

10:59.871 --> 11:01.305
I knew it!

11:01.373 --> 11:04.308
Anyone with hair that perfect
has to be guilty of something.

11:04.376 --> 11:06.777
So, if George Avocados
is the ghost trucker,

11:06.845 --> 11:09.380
That means the ghost trucker and
the knob stealer are related.

11:09.448 --> 11:11.382
Like, they're cousins?

11:11.450 --> 11:13.451
Like, they're the same person.

11:13.518 --> 11:15.953
Whoa! Screaming pandas!

11:16.021 --> 11:17.621
What is the meaning of this?
Dad.

11:17.689 --> 11:19.890
We think George Avocados
is the ghost trucker,

11:19.958 --> 11:22.393
And he's trying to sabotage
your reelection.

11:22.461 --> 11:25.196
That's completely absurd.
Why would a ghost drive a truck

11:25.263 --> 11:27.198
When everyone knows
they can fly?

11:27.265 --> 11:30.234
Especially an 18-wheeler.
Those require a class 6 license.

11:30.302 --> 11:33.037
- But dad... - I don't want to
hear any more nonsense, Fred.

11:33.104 --> 11:36.574
Clearly, you and your friends have let
your imaginations get the best of you.

11:39.377 --> 11:40.978
Hey, look!

11:41.046 --> 11:43.280
There goes Avocados now.

11:43.348 --> 11:46.317
Wait! What about me?

11:53.992 --> 11:56.460
When is Rung going to show up?

11:56.528 --> 12:00.664
I've already had 12 hands
full of finger fries.

12:13.512 --> 12:14.945
Satellite trackers all set.

12:15.013 --> 12:17.014
There's Avocados...
straight ahead.

12:17.082 --> 12:20.217
Man. You'd think a villain would
have a less embarrassing ride.

12:20.285 --> 12:22.520
Um, like, there's some
heavy soup up ahead,

12:22.587 --> 12:24.421
And we're all out of spoons.

12:24.489 --> 12:26.824
We're losing him on the radar.

12:36.570 --> 12:38.671
Aah! Ghost truck.

12:38.739 --> 12:40.673
Before you go
all code brown, think.

12:40.741 --> 12:42.842
The ghost trucker
hasn't seen us yet.

12:42.910 --> 12:45.011
It's the perfect time
to get a closer look!

12:45.079 --> 12:47.113
Great idea, Velma.

12:47.181 --> 12:49.182
Great idea?
Like, what happened

12:49.249 --> 12:52.685
To living to run away
another day?

12:52.753 --> 12:54.687
Ay!
Aah!

12:54.755 --> 12:56.956
Man. This thing is ancient.

12:59.927 --> 13:02.328
More like
painted to look that way.

13:02.396 --> 13:05.832
And check out these tires.
They're practically new.

13:05.899 --> 13:08.901
I wonder what else
isn't what it appears to be.

13:10.104 --> 13:12.972
Aah!

13:13.040 --> 13:16.042
Looks like we're gonna
have to find out later! Run!

13:32.426 --> 13:35.928
Whew.
I think we lost him. Ohh.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.563
Huh? Heh.

13:44.538 --> 13:46.439
Unh.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.309
Nobody make a sound.

13:56.984 --> 14:00.186
It worked.
He didn't see us.

14:02.656 --> 14:05.658
Sorry I'm late, Daphne,
but work has been insanely busy.

14:05.726 --> 14:08.661
In fact, ladder sales
are climbing through the roof.

14:08.729 --> 14:10.129
Heh heh heh. Ooh.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.632
What'd you order for me?
I'm starved. Mmm. Mmm.

14:12.699 --> 14:14.467
You gonna order anything?

14:16.136 --> 14:18.604
Daphne, you're never gonna
believe what happened.

14:18.672 --> 14:20.506
I can't wait to hear
all about it. Let's go.

14:20.574 --> 14:22.108
Uh, Rung here.

14:22.176 --> 14:23.843
Hey! You must be Rung!

14:23.911 --> 14:26.612
Wow, cool ascot.
What's your neck size?

14:26.680 --> 14:30.183
I'm a 16 1/2, but sometimes it
swells out to a 19 when it's humid.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.984
Uh, that's great.

14:32.052 --> 14:34.587
Uh, Daphne, shouldn't we
be getting back to dinner?

14:34.655 --> 14:37.423
Sorry, Rung, but something
more important has come up.

14:37.491 --> 14:39.158
Fine.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.760
Uh, oops.

14:40.828 --> 14:42.762
Yeah. Forgot my wallet. Daphne?

14:42.830 --> 14:44.831
By the way, I'm a big fan of your product.

14:44.898 --> 14:46.833
A sturdy ladder
is hard to find these days.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.735
Oh. Well, thanks.
I agree.

14:49.803 --> 14:54.340
And FYI, my neck's a 16 1/2, too.
And yeah, sometimes it swells.

14:54.408 --> 14:57.009
Really? Here. Hold on.

14:57.077 --> 14:59.612
There. Hey, that looks
pretty good on you.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.447
You are so right.

15:01.515 --> 15:03.783
Here. Take mine.

15:03.851 --> 15:07.920
But Fred told me he never
takes off his lucky ascot.

15:15.496 --> 15:17.830
Yikes. What's this?

15:17.898 --> 15:19.432
Like, far out.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.201
It's, like, some kind
of freaky letter, man.

15:23.837 --> 15:25.938
I have a feeling
I know who it's from.

15:26.006 --> 15:28.941
And it's not the warm and fuzzy
kind of feeling.

15:35.816 --> 15:38.684
Heh heh heh!
Greetings, everyone.

15:38.752 --> 15:40.853
This is Mr. E.

15:40.921 --> 15:42.555
- Mr. E?
- Huh?

15:42.623 --> 15:45.691
The last time we heard from this
dude, he told us we were doomed.

15:45.759 --> 15:48.194
If you want
to solve the mystery,

15:48.262 --> 15:50.129
You ned to follow the fog.

15:50.197 --> 15:54.300
Remember, crystal can't
open doors like a diamond.

15:54.368 --> 15:56.536
Talk soon.

15:56.603 --> 15:59.005
That either means
absolutely nothing,

15:59.072 --> 16:00.740
Or it's a clue.

16:00.807 --> 16:03.442
But how do we even know
we can trust Mr. E?

16:03.510 --> 16:05.978
For all we know,
he could be the ghost trucker.

16:06.046 --> 16:09.348
Don't worry, Daph.
I wouldn't let anything happen to you.

16:09.416 --> 16:11.951
You wouldn't, Fred?

16:12.019 --> 16:13.352
Of course not.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.821
I wouldn't let anything happen
to any of my pals.

16:15.889 --> 16:18.958
You're all the same in my eyes.

16:19.026 --> 16:22.061
Whether we can trust Mr. E
or not, a lead's a lead.

16:22.129 --> 16:24.463
And we need to follow it.

16:34.608 --> 16:36.475
Hey, get a load of this...

16:36.543 --> 16:39.345
Tire marks just like the ones
we found before.

16:41.081 --> 16:42.848
Oof. Ooh.

16:42.916 --> 16:46.319
Yeah. Only, these stop,
like, really fast.

16:46.386 --> 16:48.321
Or do they?

16:48.388 --> 16:51.524
Duh. There's a secret passage
somewhere.

16:51.592 --> 16:55.194
There must be a way to open it.
Let's find it.

16:59.099 --> 17:02.201
Aah!

17:06.540 --> 17:09.275
Huh?

17:17.284 --> 17:19.852
Hmm? Huh? Huh?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.420
Huh?

17:30.998 --> 17:33.399
Wow. This place is cool!

17:33.467 --> 17:35.801
It could be
our new secret hangout.

17:35.869 --> 17:37.937
Yeah... just me, you,

17:38.005 --> 17:40.806
And a couple thousand doorknobs.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.881
Look at this.

17:48.949 --> 17:51.350
- What is it, Daphne?
- Some kind of journal

17:51.418 --> 17:54.120
Belonging to a guy
named Theodore Avocados.

17:54.187 --> 17:57.089
Theodore Avocados?
That's George's dad...

17:57.157 --> 17:59.158
The one who was arrested
for diamond theft,

17:59.226 --> 18:01.060
Even though the diamond
was never found.

18:01.128 --> 18:04.063
Well, according to this,
he really was the thief.

18:04.131 --> 18:06.599
The confession is right here
in black and white.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.901
Hey, remember what
Mr. E's note said?

18:08.969 --> 18:11.570
"crystal can't
open doors like a diamond."

18:11.638 --> 18:15.174
Gang, I think this mystery
is starting to come together.

18:16.977 --> 18:20.179
Yeah. Well, it's gonna
have to come together later!

18:20.247 --> 18:23.182
Ghost trucker, stat!

18:44.404 --> 18:47.373
Why doesn't this guy
ever give up?

19:16.737 --> 19:18.738
Fred, what are we gonna do?

19:18.805 --> 19:21.907
The only thing we can do...
lead him to one of my traps.

19:30.283 --> 19:32.451
Scooby, now!

20:00.981 --> 20:02.915
Nice going, Raggy.
Heh heh heh!

20:02.983 --> 20:04.250
Good job.

20:04.317 --> 20:07.019
Pickled porcupines.
What's going on here, Fred?

20:07.087 --> 20:09.355
I was in my office working late,
when suddenly it sounds like

20:09.422 --> 20:12.024
Some demonic force
is tearing apart city hall.

20:12.092 --> 20:13.659
Tell me it's true.

20:13.727 --> 20:16.395
It's even better, dad.
We caught the ghost trucker.

20:16.463 --> 20:19.665
And he none other than...
Let me out of here.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.267
Aah! Uhh!

20:23.136 --> 20:25.337
Rung Ladderton?

20:25.405 --> 20:27.640
Ooh, ahh, shock.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

20:27.707 --> 20:30.409
And I would have gotten away with it
if it weren't for you meddling...

20:30.477 --> 20:31.677
Peers.

20:31.745 --> 20:33.813
Of course.
It all makes sense.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.082
Rung was using the ghost truck to
smuggle doorknobs out of Crystal Cove

20:37.150 --> 20:40.452
So he could find Theodore
Avocados' missing diamond.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.955
Avocados disguised
the diamond as a doorknob.

20:43.023 --> 20:45.691
That's why it was never found.

20:45.759 --> 20:48.127
You are correct,
my little ascot-wearing friend,

20:48.195 --> 20:50.362
But that idiot Avocados
didn't say in his journal

20:50.430 --> 20:52.298
Which crystal knob
was really the diamond.

20:52.365 --> 20:55.167
So, I had to steal 'em all.
And better way

20:55.235 --> 20:58.103
Than with a ghost truck
to smuggle them all out of town?

20:58.171 --> 20:59.772
We should have known.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.042
The other guy who bought
the tires was G. Nurno Treddal,

21:03.109 --> 21:05.477
Name far too ridiculous
to be real,

21:05.545 --> 21:08.214
Because it's Rung Ladderton
spelled backwards!

21:08.281 --> 21:10.916
But Rung, you're rich.
You've got everything...

21:10.984 --> 21:12.685
Ladders, ascots.

21:12.752 --> 21:14.687
Why did you need a diamond?

21:14.754 --> 21:17.323
I inherited a ladder company.

21:17.390 --> 21:20.793
We make the one product in the
world that no one ever replaces.

21:20.861 --> 21:23.929
Ladders don't wear out like TVs
or personal trainers over 40.

21:23.997 --> 21:26.298
No, no. They're built to last,
which means no sales.

21:26.366 --> 21:27.900
The company's broke.

21:27.968 --> 21:31.704
I don't think you'll be
needing this anymore.

21:31.771 --> 21:33.239
Thanks, Daph.

21:33.306 --> 21:35.641
No worries.
I'm always here for you, Fred.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.643
Seriously, right here.

21:37.711 --> 21:41.180
I gotta hand it to you, Fred.
Your traps actually came in handy this time.

21:41.248 --> 21:43.182
Gee, dad. Does this mean
you finally accept

21:43.250 --> 21:45.017
What I want to do with my life?

21:45.085 --> 21:47.286
Heh heh heh! Oh, Fred.

21:47.354 --> 21:48.787
No.

21:51.091 --> 21:54.126
And so, despite the fact that
the ghost trucker was caught,

21:54.194 --> 21:58.097
Depriving Crystal Cove of a well-needed
automotive tourist attraction...

21:59.900 --> 22:02.635
My son, the future Mayor
of Crystal Cove,

22:02.702 --> 22:05.170
And his friends have returned
the missing diamond

22:05.238 --> 22:07.172
Stolen by Theodore Avocados,

22:07.240 --> 22:10.075
More than making up for
the lost revenue stream.

22:11.811 --> 22:14.146
Because of this,
as still acting Mayor,

22:14.214 --> 22:17.917
I hereby create the honorary
office of pizza affairs

22:17.984 --> 22:20.085
And name its chief officer...

22:20.153 --> 22:23.589
- Scooby-yummy-yummy-Doo!
