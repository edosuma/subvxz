00:00.300 --> 00:03.550
You deserve to do great things.
I can make that happen.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.015
I killed someone and I need
you to help me get rid of him.

00:07.015 --> 00:08.615
What brings you here, friend?

00:08.615 --> 00:10.975
I'm looking for some answers, I guess.

00:10.975 --> 00:13.175
When can you move to the Cabinet Office?

00:13.175 --> 00:15.535
What's in the Cabinet
Office? A Russian spy.

00:15.535 --> 00:18.215
What's the hold-up?
They're checking bags?

00:18.215 --> 00:19.215
You were right.

00:19.215 --> 00:20.535
It's Miss Garrick.

00:20.535 --> 00:22.495
I wonder if you'd come to dinner?

00:22.495 --> 00:23.935
Get to know each other properly.

00:23.935 --> 00:25.175
Well, I'd love to.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.575
I don't want to do this any more.

00:26.575 --> 00:27.575
Excuse me?

00:27.575 --> 00:29.895
Her brother's probably a homosexual.

00:29.895 --> 00:33.135
Go and get my insurance policy.

00:33.135 --> 00:34.855
Freddie!

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.295 --> 01:15.735
That's good.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.295
Whatever it takes.

01:50.055 --> 01:52.855
A Russian general.

01:52.855 --> 01:55.415
I crawled through poop, literally.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.615
And he told his mistress all of it.

01:57.615 --> 01:59.095
Wow.

01:59.095 --> 02:01.775
They're bribing every
German scientist to get them

02:01.775 --> 02:02.815
over to Moscow.

02:02.815 --> 02:05.735
There's gonna be an arms race.

02:05.735 --> 02:07.815
I've got the general on tape.

02:07.815 --> 02:09.134
Wow.

02:10.655 --> 02:13.975
So, what about you?
What are you working on?

02:13.975 --> 02:16.855
Located a Russian spy in Whitehall.

02:16.855 --> 02:18.775
Wow.

02:18.775 --> 02:20.455
You got proof?

02:20.455 --> 02:21.695
Working on it.

02:21.695 --> 02:23.575
Where are the others?

02:23.575 --> 02:26.095
Our man from Switzerland
gets in on the four o'clock,

02:26.095 --> 02:29.175
our guys from Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia got in late last night.

02:29.175 --> 02:32.015
We pitch the big five...

02:32.015 --> 02:33.335
..tomorrow.

02:33.335 --> 02:36.815
Well, look, all of you need
to type up written reports

02:36.815 --> 02:40.935
emphasising one,
what you've seen, as OSS agents,

02:40.935 --> 02:43.695
indicating the Russian threat,
two, what you've done to combat it,

02:43.695 --> 02:46.855
and three, what you could do with an
actual budget and formal leadership.

02:46.855 --> 02:49.095
I have bullet points for you here.

02:50.735 --> 02:54.535
I would like to give Truman a
sheaf of documents from all of us

02:54.535 --> 02:59.055
that present clearly, in black
and white, why he urgently needs

02:59.055 --> 03:02.455
to create an operational
American intelligence agency.

03:02.455 --> 03:04.575
I prefer to do a verbal presentation.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.575
Dictate it to me if you want.

03:06.575 --> 03:07.535
I have to go.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.495
Is the girl going tonight?

03:13.255 --> 03:14.855
You're welcome to bunk with me.

03:14.855 --> 03:17.735
My place is pretty basic
but, uh, I got a floor,

03:17.735 --> 03:20.455
blankets and bottles of Scotch.

03:20.455 --> 03:23.335
Jimmy said he'd book rooms for
out-of-towners at Claridges.

03:23.335 --> 03:25.295
Wow!

03:25.295 --> 03:26.775
Did our budget increase?

03:26.775 --> 03:28.895
The big five is taking
this meeting very,

03:28.895 --> 03:33.575
very seriously and if Truman is
planning on getting a second term,

03:33.575 --> 03:36.895
then he's gonna jump
through any hoop they say.

03:36.895 --> 03:40.975
These guys, these guys' fathers,
these guys' grandfathers -

03:40.975 --> 03:42.295
they pick the President.

03:42.295 --> 03:45.135
And they're taking off right
after the meeting taking whatever

03:45.135 --> 03:47.575
Intel you share right back to Truman.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.495
And there's gonna be a
conversation about leadership, right?

03:50.495 --> 03:53.335
I mean, who's gonna be
running this new organisation?

03:53.335 --> 03:56.135
Because otherwise,
what are we doing here?

03:56.135 --> 03:58.455
Am I leaning on the General
because he's cheating?

03:58.455 --> 04:00.255
Am I staying in the shadows?

04:00.255 --> 04:02.335
Stay in the shadows.

04:02.335 --> 04:04.935
If he doesn't know you're
listening the more he'll talk.

04:06.015 --> 04:08.975
Unless I pull his fingernails.

04:08.975 --> 04:12.175
So, Jimbo, honey, there needs
to be a leadership conversation.

04:12.175 --> 04:14.655
Mm. Like we talked about.

04:17.855 --> 04:18.975
Honey.

04:20.975 --> 04:23.415
You're, you're actually
going to pick out my outfit?

04:23.415 --> 04:24.855
Yes, you have to look naive.

04:24.855 --> 04:27.655
What you're wearing makes
you look buttoned up. Uptight.

04:27.655 --> 04:29.175
Like you have secrets.

04:30.615 --> 04:31.815
Put this on.

04:31.815 --> 04:33.855
But if, if it's sexy,
Priscilla doesn't like it.

04:33.855 --> 04:35.575
No, now that's not sexy. It's naive!

04:35.575 --> 04:37.535
She doesn't like women
to use their sexuality!

04:39.215 --> 04:41.535
Walk through the whole place.

04:41.535 --> 04:43.775
Look for a space we can put a bug.

04:43.775 --> 04:45.775
I need a list of options for tomorrow.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.415
Get as precise a portrait of her life

04:48.415 --> 04:49.335
as possible.

04:50.495 --> 04:52.255
She's the key to
uncovering the whole Russian

04:52.255 --> 04:53.735
operation in London.

04:55.655 --> 04:57.695
I know you're frightened.

04:57.695 --> 04:59.215
She trusts you.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.375
We're nearly there.

05:15.855 --> 05:17.375
That's terribly good.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.975
I can't get a word out of any of my
chaps on the Palestine Committee.

05:19.975 --> 05:22.975
Oh, I know!
It's supposed to be Anglo-American.

05:22.975 --> 05:26.775
I'm sure they must realise the
Americans have their own agenda.

05:26.775 --> 05:29.055
Well, you would've thought
they would. Well, tell us.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.575
Aren't you seeing a young
man on the committee?

05:31.575 --> 05:34.135
Oh, yes, but he doesn't tell me a thing.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.775
Who's that? Mm. Hugh Fenton.

05:36.775 --> 05:39.215
Oh, Mr Fenton. The earnest one.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.695
Wedding bells? Really?

05:41.695 --> 05:43.935
What, then he tells you
nothing about the committee?

05:43.935 --> 05:44.975
Nothing.

05:44.975 --> 05:47.415
Oh, not everyone likes to talk politics

05:47.415 --> 05:48.695
at social settings, Herbert.

05:48.695 --> 05:49.855
I for...

05:49.855 --> 05:52.135
..example, would like to

05:52.135 --> 05:53.855
talk about anything else.

05:53.855 --> 05:55.415
Why did you bring her?

05:55.415 --> 05:57.895
What'd you think we
were gonna talk about?

05:57.895 --> 06:00.095
Well, I thought we might
like to talk to his wife...

06:00.095 --> 06:02.055
Oh, I'll drink to that.

06:02.055 --> 06:04.335
Now, Winn,

06:04.335 --> 06:06.255
confirm or deny.

06:06.255 --> 06:07.375
Yes!

06:08.455 --> 06:13.215
The Ministry of Supply is pushing
nuclear power plants because

06:13.215 --> 06:17.895
our Mr United Nations World
Peace Attlee wants to build

06:17.895 --> 06:20.255
a nuclear bomb for ourselves!

06:20.255 --> 06:22.495
Come on Winn. Confirm or deny?

06:22.495 --> 06:24.495
Not playing that game.

06:24.495 --> 06:27.255
Ohh! What is point of inviting the
Chief Whip of the Labour Party to

06:27.255 --> 06:30.175
dinner if he won't spill
any beans? Hear, hear!

06:30.175 --> 06:33.455
Herbert, Herbert, Nicholas,
don't put him in that position.

06:33.455 --> 06:36.055
The game's just supposed
to be for silly gossip.

06:36.055 --> 06:38.575
Apologies. Kharasho.

06:38.575 --> 06:40.975
I heard Attlee has a mistress.

06:40.975 --> 06:43.255
Now, don't be ridiculous.
Can you believe that?

06:43.255 --> 06:45.495
Excuse me, where is the loo?

06:45.495 --> 06:47.935
It's, uh, just up the stairs
and to the left. Thank you.

06:47.935 --> 06:49.535
Well, gossip is a sin.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.015
True. Of course.

06:51.015 --> 06:53.815
But, uh, uh, did you
hear about Maria's son?

06:53.815 --> 06:55.175
No, do tell.

06:55.175 --> 06:57.335
He was born with some dreadful disease.

06:57.335 --> 07:02.375
Now her husband has finally admitted
that it was actually hereditary.

07:10.135 --> 07:11.455
Runs in his family.

07:18.055 --> 07:19.055
Is it tea time?

07:19.055 --> 07:21.655
I'm sorry. I thought this was the loo.

07:22.815 --> 07:24.335
I, I thought that was the loo.

07:24.335 --> 07:26.415
I know what you're doing. Sorry?

07:26.415 --> 07:28.655
Stop.

07:28.655 --> 07:30.535
Stop what? I don't know what you mean.

07:30.535 --> 07:31.855
Let me be very, very clear.

07:31.855 --> 07:35.935
If something happens to me
- something happens to you.

07:45.855 --> 07:48.575
And why are they any less
important than the people who want...

07:48.575 --> 07:49.655
Good point.

07:49.655 --> 07:51.935
..independence? Good lad.
Now, who is for dessert?

07:51.935 --> 07:53.375
Oh, I should actually get going.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.655
Well, you'll stay for dessert.

07:56.455 --> 07:59.495
Well, if dessert is as good as
the main course I'm going to

07:59.495 --> 08:02.055
insist you invite me
to dinner every week.

08:03.935 --> 08:05.455
Thank you, thank you.

08:08.095 --> 08:10.015
So, yes, what is for dessert?

08:10.015 --> 08:10.975
Gooseberry crumble.

08:30.455 --> 08:31.815
She's onto me.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.375
She knows about me.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.095
How do you know?

08:35.095 --> 08:36.294
She warned me off.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.495
She warned you off?

08:40.495 --> 08:43.335
She said, "If something happens
to me, something happens to you."

08:43.335 --> 08:44.815
Hey!

08:44.815 --> 08:46.935
Cassandra, I have good news.

08:46.935 --> 08:50.095
People who plan to murder other
people, don't give them a heads up.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.655
She will murder me if I don't back off.

08:52.655 --> 08:53.855
We have to stop.

08:53.855 --> 08:56.455
No, no, no, honey, the point is
she doesn't want to hurt you.

08:56.455 --> 08:59.815
Which means her commitment
to the great cause wavers.

08:59.815 --> 09:01.295
Her loyalties are divided.

09:01.295 --> 09:02.855
What did you say?

09:02.855 --> 09:05.295
I pretended I didn't know
what she was talking about.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.375
I ate my fucking dessert.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.815
I nearly threw it up.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.335
We can turn her.

09:10.335 --> 09:11.655
You can turn her.

09:11.655 --> 09:12.815
She can work for us.

09:12.815 --> 09:14.495
Look, here's what you're gonna do.

09:14.495 --> 09:17.015
Tomorrow you're gonna ask her
to get a cup of tea with you -

09:17.015 --> 09:18.855
out of the office. I'm gonna help you.

09:18.855 --> 09:20.815
We'll do it together.
A two-pronged approach.

09:20.815 --> 09:23.535
Get into her head.
Oh, my God, you have to stop, please!

09:23.535 --> 09:25.375
Please! Please, just, just let me go.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.095
Just let me go, please.

09:29.455 --> 09:32.615
That Mr Winn really
doesn't like Churchill.

09:33.735 --> 09:35.215
Not much, no.

09:35.215 --> 09:36.455
Hm.

09:36.455 --> 09:39.575
He was just drunk and showing off.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.095
They were all drunk.

09:43.095 --> 09:45.215
You sounded like you were having fun.

09:45.215 --> 09:46.535
Did I?

09:47.655 --> 09:48.615
You weren't?

09:51.015 --> 09:52.415
Don't know any more.

09:56.735 --> 09:58.495
I was, uh,

09:59.535 --> 10:02.375
I was wondering the other day...

10:02.375 --> 10:03.935
..silly really...

10:06.375 --> 10:08.575
But if Jarvis had known that it was me

10:08.575 --> 10:09.775
- that I'm the one -

10:11.735 --> 10:13.615
would you have killed me too?

10:16.735 --> 10:18.695
You cannot be asking me that.

10:18.695 --> 10:19.735
No more for you.

10:19.735 --> 10:21.015
Tell me.

10:21.015 --> 10:23.735
15 years we've known each other.

10:23.735 --> 10:25.375
I cook for you. You drink with me.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.735
You help me with my garden.

10:26.735 --> 10:28.375
I help you with your father.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.135
We're friends.

10:32.015 --> 10:33.335
Are we?

10:33.335 --> 10:35.455
Now, you're silly.

10:38.215 --> 10:40.295
Yes, I am.

10:40.295 --> 10:42.855
I am very silly.

10:42.855 --> 10:45.015
I'm going to put on a kettle.

10:53.215 --> 10:54.535
The girl...

10:56.815 --> 10:58.375
..at the dinner...

10:59.935 --> 11:01.735
..she's on to me.

11:35.255 --> 11:37.855
Oi, what are you doing here?

11:37.855 --> 11:39.375
Get back to where you came from.

11:41.255 --> 11:43.095
Do I have to call the police?

11:59.215 --> 12:02.015
Mr Mulligan, where's Miss Symonds?

12:02.015 --> 12:04.135
She late? Called in.

12:04.135 --> 12:06.935
She's got that stomach bug
that's been going around.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.015
How miserable.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.335
Let's send her something.

12:13.335 --> 12:14.655
Will you get me her home address?

12:17.495 --> 12:19.535
I think that's more
of a secretary's job.

12:27.255 --> 12:28.255
Thank you.

12:32.415 --> 12:33.935
Close the door on your way out.

12:48.615 --> 12:50.575
Two Rs?

12:50.575 --> 12:51.415
Two Rs.

12:54.255 --> 12:55.255
Thank you.

12:58.815 --> 13:00.895
Well, I'll leave that with you.

13:09.295 --> 13:11.375
Nice lunch? Very nice.

13:48.775 --> 13:51.255
Hello. You must be here about the oven.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.655
Oven, yes.

13:52.655 --> 13:53.655
Come in.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.375
Uh, now, it is a fairly old oven.

13:57.375 --> 13:59.095
It's not entirely broken

13:59.095 --> 14:01.375
but for some reason it does
keep switching itself off.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.295
Now, I first noticed it on Wednesday

14:03.295 --> 14:06.775
because I managed to access some
lamb, finally, and I put it in.

14:06.775 --> 14:09.895
Took it out 45 minutes later and
it just wasn't cooked through.

14:09.895 --> 14:11.655
Now, I assumed it was my fault.

14:11.655 --> 14:13.935
But then on Thursday I put in
a potato to bake and it came

14:13.935 --> 14:16.615
out raw and I actually thought
- did I forget to turn the oven on?

14:16.615 --> 14:19.135
Then, bafflingly, on Friday,
I made a crumble and it was perfect.

14:19.135 --> 14:20.695
And, so, oven working.

14:20.695 --> 14:22.895
Then over the weekend I tried
to bake eggs and nothing.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.895
So, I said to my husband,
"Harry, you have to take a look.".

14:25.895 --> 14:28.215
Husband? Yes.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.695
And he did look, fairly predictably
he shed no light on the matter

14:30.695 --> 14:32.055
and that's when I called you.

14:32.055 --> 14:34.855
There's a manual here which
was about as much help as Harry.

14:34.855 --> 14:39.615
But what I've discovered
is if you turn this on...

14:45.895 --> 14:48.655
This place is very nice.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.975
Who've you got paying for it?

14:50.975 --> 14:51.975
Are you a mistress now?

15:05.695 --> 15:08.655
That's not me. It is... you.

15:10.095 --> 15:13.975
And I think what needs to happen is,
is you need to leave the country.

15:13.975 --> 15:15.095
Why?

15:16.855 --> 15:19.415
Because I'm being blackmailed.

15:19.415 --> 15:21.535
But I can't keep doing what
these people want me to do,

15:21.535 --> 15:24.495
so I have to let this come out.

15:24.495 --> 15:26.615
No, no, no. No, Feef.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.535
They cut it off. They cut it off.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.015
That's what happened to my friend!

15:30.015 --> 15:31.455
Yes. That's why you need to leave.

15:31.455 --> 15:33.895
You need to go to Ceylon.
You need to stay with your in-laws.

15:33.895 --> 15:35.975
But they're coming home.
It's not safe now.

15:35.975 --> 15:38.535
Then go to India. Or Africa.

15:38.535 --> 15:41.855
My God, Freddie, the sun never
sets on the British empire.

15:41.855 --> 15:43.935
Just pick a spot and go there.

15:43.935 --> 15:45.615
No, but the sun does set.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.655
It has! There's nowhere for me to go!

15:50.295 --> 15:52.975
I can't keep working for these people.

15:52.975 --> 15:54.415
Who, are they?

15:54.415 --> 15:55.695
Americans.

15:55.695 --> 15:57.615
Well, what's wrong with that?
You like Americans.

15:57.615 --> 15:59.255
Not these Americans.

15:59.255 --> 16:01.775
Where are the negatives?
Where are the fucking negatives!?

16:01.775 --> 16:03.855
I don't know Freddie! You idiot!

16:03.855 --> 16:06.415
This is not my fault.
It is your fucking fault!

16:06.415 --> 16:08.015
No! This is your fucking fault

16:08.015 --> 16:10.015
because you were stupid
enough to get caught!

16:10.015 --> 16:12.375
You've always been stupid and
you've always been selfish!

16:12.375 --> 16:13.975
We never get to talk about it.

16:13.975 --> 16:16.535
We only talk about how,
how I'm an idiot, and I failed,

16:16.535 --> 16:18.975
and I'm nothing when it's not true!

16:21.975 --> 16:22.975
Look at me.

16:28.295 --> 16:30.935
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:37.655 --> 16:39.535
Think, think.

16:39.535 --> 16:41.495
There must be someone else who can help.

16:42.975 --> 16:44.615
Who?

17:06.214 --> 17:08.895
Miss Symonds is not at her desk?

17:08.895 --> 17:10.375
She is unwell?

17:11.694 --> 17:14.615
Yes, just tell her that
Norman Pitman telephoned

17:14.615 --> 17:20.135
in response to her queries about
our steel production figures.

17:22.734 --> 17:24.295
Yes, she has my number.

17:37.775 --> 17:38.975
I told you to watch her.

17:40.295 --> 17:43.575
I told you, a neighbour
threatened to call the police.

17:46.175 --> 17:47.375
Watch your tongue.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.215
It's in Northern France.

17:54.215 --> 17:56.655
Can produce five tonnes of
fabricated sheet steel products

17:56.655 --> 17:57.775
every week.

17:57.775 --> 18:00.375
Equipment's in good shape.
Workers are trained up.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.535
Previous owners, Jewish. Dead.

18:02.535 --> 18:05.415
And the French government
are just giving it away.

18:05.415 --> 18:06.695
You snap it up?

18:06.695 --> 18:08.855
You bet your ass I did,
and ten more like it.

18:16.055 --> 18:17.735
Hey, there, beautiful.

18:17.735 --> 18:21.015
What can I do you for?

18:21.015 --> 18:25.135
Let me introduce you to my Dad.

18:25.135 --> 18:26.695
These are a few of his friends.

18:26.695 --> 18:29.295
These guys are titans of industry.

18:29.295 --> 18:31.375
Heads of steel, coal, railroad.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.135
This...

18:33.135 --> 18:34.495
..is Feef Symonds.

18:34.495 --> 18:35.855
How do you do?

18:35.855 --> 18:37.575
You'll be briefed on her later.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.455
She's with us but, as you can see,

18:40.455 --> 18:42.015
she is quite the asset.

18:44.535 --> 18:45.975
Great to meet you, sweetie.

18:47.655 --> 18:50.295
Can I talk to you in private?

18:50.295 --> 18:51.335
Sure. Yeah.

18:54.855 --> 18:56.495
She can't have gone far.

18:58.495 --> 19:01.335
Her clothes are still
here and everything.

19:05.335 --> 19:08.095
Well, if you want something
done right, do it yourself.

19:10.895 --> 19:13.735
Remind me where Miss
Garrick transfers buses.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.135
And at what time.

19:21.975 --> 19:23.775
You look nice.

19:23.775 --> 19:26.535
You always seemed nice.

19:26.535 --> 19:29.655
I am. That's the thing about me.

19:29.655 --> 19:30.735
Hm.

19:30.735 --> 19:32.695
What's going on? You OK?

19:32.695 --> 19:34.375
I need to talk to Peter McCormick.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.855
Why?

19:37.855 --> 19:40.855
This is absolutely a secret.

19:40.855 --> 19:42.015
OK.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.535
During the war,
Peter and I were together.

19:45.535 --> 19:48.375
That's how I got involved with
all of this in the first place.

19:48.375 --> 19:49.375
And he and I...

19:51.975 --> 19:53.615
..we had a daughter.

19:55.615 --> 19:56.855
Whoops.

19:56.855 --> 19:59.055
He wanted me to get rid of her.

19:59.055 --> 20:01.095
I refused.

20:01.095 --> 20:03.095
Good. Good, good for you.

20:03.095 --> 20:05.095
That's, uh, that's, uh...

20:05.095 --> 20:06.535
Wow.

20:06.535 --> 20:08.175
Well, now there's a medical problem.

20:08.175 --> 20:10.455
And I'm sure it will be fine,
but doctors are asking

20:10.455 --> 20:12.695
if it's hereditary and
questions about blood types

20:12.695 --> 20:15.375
and if they could just talk to
Peter it would be helpful because...

20:15.375 --> 20:16.415
Wait, wait, wait,

20:16.415 --> 20:18.535
why the hell didn't Peter
just give you his address?

20:18.535 --> 20:20.135
Well, he said he was on a mission.

20:21.975 --> 20:22.975
Uh, liar.

20:22.975 --> 20:25.095
He retired. He's in the States.

20:26.495 --> 20:28.695
He's in the States?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.335
Jimmy?

20:30.335 --> 20:31.655
Are we going to eat?

20:31.655 --> 20:33.735
Yeah.

20:33.735 --> 20:35.175
They'll have his address on file.

20:35.175 --> 20:37.335
Who will? The OSS, West London.

21:19.095 --> 21:22.095
I can get the number
nine from here, right?

21:22.095 --> 21:23.895
Yes, that's correct.

21:37.055 --> 21:38.895
Must be a real page-turner.

21:41.615 --> 21:44.735
Your book's open but,
but you're not reading.

21:44.735 --> 21:47.175
It's absorbing. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

21:51.535 --> 21:54.015
That's the problem with
being alone all the time.

21:54.015 --> 21:56.495
You start talking to strangers.

22:02.135 --> 22:04.975
What, what part of the States?

22:04.975 --> 22:08.735
Oh, do you know it? Not really.

22:08.735 --> 22:10.975
Well, Pennsylvania, originally.

22:10.975 --> 22:14.775
I've travelled a lot since then. So...

22:14.775 --> 22:17.375
What do you do?

22:17.375 --> 22:18.695
Work for the Red Cross.

22:20.975 --> 22:23.695
Well, what do you do with the Red Cross?

22:23.695 --> 22:26.255
Administrate recovery zones.

22:26.255 --> 22:27.775
Logistics.

22:27.775 --> 22:30.055
Enough hospital beds
here, syringes there.

22:30.055 --> 22:32.495
It's kind of boring,
really. Facts, figures.

22:32.495 --> 22:33.735
But for a very good cause.

22:36.735 --> 22:39.975
Listen, I...

22:39.975 --> 22:43.095
I don't suppose... Uh, no.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.855
Yeah, I don't suppose you'd like
to get a bite to eat or something?

22:45.855 --> 22:47.975
I... I, uh...

22:47.975 --> 22:49.975
I'm not really looking
for that sort of thing.

22:49.975 --> 22:52.975
No, that's OK. Of course. No, I just...

22:52.975 --> 22:55.255
I noticed you didn't have a
ring on your finger and...

22:55.255 --> 22:57.775
I'm sorry. I...

22:59.495 --> 23:02.695
..the greyness in this
city gets me down sometimes.

23:02.695 --> 23:07.415
I'm sure there's got to be secret
places in this town with lights

23:07.415 --> 23:09.535
and colour and...

23:09.535 --> 23:11.215
..people going dancing.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.615
But I can't seem to find them.

23:14.615 --> 23:17.255
Well, there... there are a few.

23:19.055 --> 23:21.695
Could I give you my number?

23:21.695 --> 23:24.495
Yes. Yeah? Yes, that would be fine.

23:39.775 --> 23:41.015
What's your name?

23:43.015 --> 23:43.975
Peter.

24:38.175 --> 24:40.655
Yeah, good morning.

24:40.655 --> 24:45.535
I was wondering if you guys
were having any more meetings.

24:45.535 --> 24:46.815
Yeah, I came one other time.

24:49.095 --> 24:50.615
But why do you want to know my name?

24:53.375 --> 24:54.615
Yes, the American.

24:56.655 --> 24:57.975
Yeah, the coloured chap.

25:05.215 --> 25:06.335
I need to talk to who?

25:08.535 --> 25:09.575
A Richard Gregory?

25:13.335 --> 25:14.335
And what does he do?

25:15.975 --> 25:18.095
What, specialise in
negroes or something?

25:22.455 --> 25:23.975
Can I help you?

25:23.975 --> 25:26.455
Uh, I work for Jimmy
Derby at the embassy.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.695
He needs a number and
address for Peter McCormick.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.215
Peter. Yeah, he went home.

25:31.215 --> 25:33.335
Wasn't he from DC?

25:33.335 --> 25:34.695
Um...

25:34.695 --> 25:36.615
..Peter from Idaho?

25:36.615 --> 25:38.455
Uh, lives with his wife?

25:38.455 --> 25:41.055
McCormick, right. DC.

25:41.055 --> 25:42.935
That's not his wife.

25:44.695 --> 25:46.775
Go down the hall.
Dixie will have his file.

25:57.095 --> 25:59.455
I have no idea why,
but Peter's file is missing.

26:00.615 --> 26:02.535
Really? Yes, it's gone.

26:02.535 --> 26:04.175
Must've...

26:04.175 --> 26:06.175
..ugh, I don't know. It's odd.

26:12.455 --> 26:13.455
It doesn't matter.

26:21.575 --> 26:23.975
You don't have an address
for Thomas Rowe, do you?

26:46.575 --> 26:47.775
You Jackson?

26:52.295 --> 26:53.295
You Richard?

26:59.815 --> 27:02.335
Simon tell you I was coloured?

27:02.335 --> 27:03.455
He said I'd like you.

27:04.815 --> 27:06.335
I guess that's what they meant.

27:07.775 --> 27:09.895
Have you read the Manifesto?

27:09.895 --> 27:10.975
Bits.

27:13.895 --> 27:15.055
What do you think?

27:17.895 --> 27:19.255
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

27:25.975 --> 27:28.095
Let's do this, OK?

27:28.095 --> 27:29.375
So you're doing the intros.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.455
We go around the table
with what everybody's up to,

27:31.455 --> 27:34.455
then I'll summarise, lay out the
case for an intelligence agency.

27:34.455 --> 27:35.855
Sounds good, brother.

27:38.015 --> 27:38.855
Gentlemen!

27:40.735 --> 27:41.775
Take your seats.

27:58.895 --> 28:01.855
My family ran north in
the middle of the night.

28:01.855 --> 28:03.015
Barely made it out.

28:05.295 --> 28:07.455
But you made it all the way here. Hm.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.255
I travelled with this white woman.

28:12.575 --> 28:13.935
Left her, but stayed here.

28:16.335 --> 28:17.695
You ever fuck a white girl?

28:20.455 --> 28:22.015
That's why you're a Communist?

28:25.295 --> 28:28.735
Communism not only
demands racial equality,

28:28.735 --> 28:30.655
it can't function without it.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.455
Why are you here?

28:40.375 --> 28:41.695
I'm curious.

28:41.695 --> 28:42.775
Curious?

28:44.415 --> 28:46.935
Negroes have to be desperate
to pick up the Manifesto.

28:48.095 --> 28:50.015
Especially if you grew up in the South.

28:52.135 --> 28:54.375
All that church nonsense
they shove down your throat

28:54.375 --> 28:56.055
from the time you're born

28:56.055 --> 28:57.455
messes with your head.

29:00.175 --> 29:01.535
So I ask again...

29:04.295 --> 29:05.295
..why are you here?

29:11.175 --> 29:12.175
My brother Aaron.

29:14.855 --> 29:16.255
He was in the service like me.

29:18.375 --> 29:19.855
Got discharged a year ago.

29:24.975 --> 29:26.895
This little white boy
about ten years old

29:26.895 --> 29:28.215
lived down the road from us.

29:31.255 --> 29:33.455
Aaron liked telling him
stories about the war.

29:35.455 --> 29:37.815
Every day, he begged him
to tell him another one.

29:41.335 --> 29:43.295
Boy's father didn't like that too much.

29:46.455 --> 29:47.575
First, they beat him.

29:50.975 --> 29:51.815
Then they shot him.

29:55.775 --> 29:56.855
Then they burned him.

29:59.775 --> 30:01.455
Just cos he told war stories?

30:03.855 --> 30:05.535
Because before the war...

30:06.895 --> 30:07.935
..Aaron was a good boy.

30:10.335 --> 30:11.935
"Yes, suh.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.855
"No, suh.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.015
"Whatever you need, Boss."

30:17.575 --> 30:18.615
After the war...

30:22.655 --> 30:23.975
..he stopped bowing his head.

30:28.455 --> 30:30.135
He really thought he was somebody.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.175
So, Communism going to fix that?

30:41.535 --> 30:44.455
Negroes are uniquely qualified

30:44.455 --> 30:46.815
to develop a larger vision for society

30:46.815 --> 30:49.055
because we are uniquely invested.

30:51.255 --> 30:53.255
Man, we need that revolution.

30:55.015 --> 30:56.535
And we gon' get it.

31:08.615 --> 31:10.935
What I need is to present
Harry with a realistic

31:10.935 --> 31:13.135
business plan of what
we're talking about today.

31:13.135 --> 31:15.855
Understood, and here
is a budget proposal.

31:31.455 --> 31:33.495
This is not enough money.

31:33.495 --> 31:36.055
Jimmy and I have been through
the figures with a lot of detail.

31:36.055 --> 31:38.695
What kind of operations
are you imagining?

31:38.695 --> 31:41.175
This covers 1,000 salaries?

31:41.175 --> 31:43.215
We need people all over the world.

31:43.215 --> 31:47.095
Gentlemen, if there's one
thing Hiroshima taught us,

31:47.095 --> 31:50.855
it's that the world now
knows to do what we say.

31:50.855 --> 31:52.735
That's right.

31:52.735 --> 31:56.015
Blowing up Russia, or anywhere else,

31:56.015 --> 31:59.815
is not a long-term solution unless
you want to live in a graveyard.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.135
We need to capture hearts and minds.

32:05.175 --> 32:08.255
We need to hear about
revolutions before they happen.

32:08.255 --> 32:11.815
We need to take a leaf
out of the Russian playbook

32:11.815 --> 32:13.895
and beat them at their own game.

32:13.895 --> 32:16.095
Agents infiltrated everywhere.

32:16.095 --> 32:18.455
We can never be the last to know.

32:19.535 --> 32:21.895
So, you want us to double the budget?

32:21.895 --> 32:23.695
Multiply it by 1,000.

32:25.655 --> 32:28.055
This is the one I told you about,

32:28.055 --> 32:29.975
the one who lost his mind in Bucharest.

32:33.375 --> 32:35.175
You think I'm delusional?

32:36.375 --> 32:38.775
You are labouring under
a delusion, gentlemen.

32:38.775 --> 32:41.895
You think you're strong,
but you're vulnerable.

32:41.895 --> 32:44.295
You can sleep on a bed of money,

32:44.295 --> 32:48.015
but a washed-up poet in
a garret called Karl Marx

32:48.015 --> 32:51.015
wrote a fucking pamphlet
and he set the world on fire.

32:52.455 --> 32:55.455
All he had was pen, paper and an idea.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.615
You want money and power?

33:03.615 --> 33:07.455
But all the money and all the power
in the world doesn't mean anything.

33:09.095 --> 33:13.295
Because right at this very
moment, some nobody somewhere

33:13.295 --> 33:17.215
is sitting in his crappy flat,
or hut or jail cell,

33:17.215 --> 33:20.335
plotting how to take
down the entire world.

33:21.975 --> 33:23.975
Now, this man

33:23.975 --> 33:25.895
doesn't have money,

33:25.895 --> 33:27.255
access or resources.

33:29.775 --> 33:34.055
But all the armies in the entire
goddamn universe will never be able

33:34.055 --> 33:37.215
to defeat him because you
cannot destroy an idea.

33:38.815 --> 33:41.295
And that's all it takes.

33:41.295 --> 33:45.295
One idea that sparks
the popular imagination.

33:45.295 --> 33:48.935
One idea that tells the
masses they can have it all

33:48.935 --> 33:50.175
if they just believe.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.015
One idea,

33:53.015 --> 33:55.895
and everything you built is lost...

33:55.895 --> 33:57.575
..just like that.

33:59.855 --> 34:03.175
See, you think you're
selling goods and services.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.175
You're not.

34:05.455 --> 34:06.895
You're selling democracy.

34:08.735 --> 34:11.054
And the only way to sell democracy

34:11.054 --> 34:14.574
is to have eyes and ears everywhere

34:14.574 --> 34:17.655
to stop every little guy
who wants to undermine it.

34:21.014 --> 34:21.975
You want a free market?

34:23.255 --> 34:26.815
You want to buy shit,
sell shit in peace?

34:26.815 --> 34:29.775
Then you need a government
organisation looking out for you

34:29.775 --> 34:33.855
at all times, all over the world,

34:33.855 --> 34:37.094
protecting democracy,
protecting capitalism, protecting you.

34:39.775 --> 34:41.855
It's a long, expert game.

34:42.895 --> 34:44.895
It costs money...

34:46.094 --> 34:47.175
..real money.

34:48.855 --> 34:50.895
But, my God,

34:50.895 --> 34:52.335
don't you think it's worth it?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.735
Let's go.

37:52.735 --> 37:54.255
Don't want to keep Rowe waiting.

38:02.775 --> 38:04.695
When you went to Peter's hotel room

38:04.695 --> 38:07.135
and got his things...

38:07.135 --> 38:08.855
did you know he was dead?

38:13.055 --> 38:15.055
Why didn't you say anything to me?

38:20.135 --> 38:21.455
He paid me.

38:23.495 --> 38:25.455
I've got a mother who skips meals

38:25.455 --> 38:27.455
so there's enough just
to feed my sisters.

38:29.535 --> 38:31.055
And in addition to that...

38:32.975 --> 38:35.535
..I didn't want to tell you
what I shouldn't and end up

38:35.535 --> 38:37.055
at the bottom of the river myself.

38:37.055 --> 38:38.735
I barely knew you.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.735
You think I should risk my life for you?

38:44.135 --> 38:45.295
Why?

38:46.815 --> 38:48.735
Because you're a nice girl?

38:58.855 --> 39:01.575
It's such an ugly world, isn't it?

39:03.415 --> 39:04.895
Oh, you didn't know that?

39:08.775 --> 39:10.095
I'm getting out of here.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.895
And if you're smart...

39:15.055 --> 39:16.495
..that's what you'll do too.

39:18.535 --> 39:21.655
Just get on the train, bus, a boat.

39:23.735 --> 39:26.495
Because I don't see
another way out of this.

39:32.255 --> 39:34.415
I don't want to leave England.

39:36.095 --> 39:38.455
This is my country.

40:16.495 --> 40:18.255
You didn't go to work today.

40:20.295 --> 40:22.495
Everything all right?

40:22.495 --> 40:24.295
Not really.

40:26.335 --> 40:27.935
Want to talk about it?

40:29.055 --> 40:30.295
Sure.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.535
So, when you told me Peter was
off on a mission, that was a lie,

40:38.535 --> 40:40.375
wasn't it?

40:40.375 --> 40:43.495
And the letter I received from him,
you wrote that, didn't you?

40:47.015 --> 40:48.535
I...

40:48.535 --> 40:51.295
honestly don't know what
you're talking about.

40:51.295 --> 40:54.095
Someone told me once that when
people add the word "honestly"

40:54.095 --> 40:55.335
that means they're lying.

40:56.895 --> 40:58.775
That's...

40:58.775 --> 41:00.455
honestly bullshit.

41:00.455 --> 41:02.695
You are going to leave
me and my family alone.

41:02.695 --> 41:05.135
If you don't, I will tell the
English bloody army about you,

41:05.135 --> 41:06.215
if I have to.

41:06.215 --> 41:08.815
I don't know what's gotten you so
worked up, but I have good news.

41:08.815 --> 41:10.015
Really good news.

41:10.015 --> 41:11.775
About our mission and our future.

41:11.775 --> 41:13.935
I met Garrick. I asked her out.

41:15.535 --> 41:18.455
I'll spend a few weeks getting to
know her - nudge, nudge, wink, wink,

41:18.455 --> 41:20.575
as you Brits like to say.
I think she's turnable.

41:20.575 --> 41:23.455
You can make the approach,
but I can lay the groundwork.

41:23.455 --> 41:25.135
Sow some doubt.

41:25.135 --> 41:26.975
We have the luxury of time now.

41:26.975 --> 41:31.015
Because the powers that be are very,
very pleased with our work.

41:31.015 --> 41:34.095
We're gonna have more
resources, more men and women.

41:34.095 --> 41:37.855
We can uncover the entire
Russian operation in London.

41:37.855 --> 41:41.295
And beyond. And I swear, Feef,
it'll be the stuff of legend.

41:41.295 --> 41:45.575
And it'll have been an old man
and a girl that made it happen.

41:45.575 --> 41:48.695
An old man and a girl saving the world!

41:48.695 --> 41:50.015
I don't even want to stand near you!

41:50.015 --> 41:51.775
I don't want to breathe
the same air as you.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.615
Just tell me you killed him.
I want you to say it! Why?!

42:00.655 --> 42:01.815
You just told me.

42:08.615 --> 42:10.855
Go, tell whoever you want!

42:12.855 --> 42:15.735
I can disappear like a ghost.

42:15.735 --> 42:17.495
And that's what I'll do.

42:19.335 --> 42:23.095
And then one day, when you
least expect it, your brother,

42:23.095 --> 42:26.255
your father, your mother,
something nasty will happen to 'em.

42:26.255 --> 42:28.695
And that'll be because of you, Bug!

42:31.855 --> 42:34.415
Where are you gonna go?

42:34.415 --> 42:37.295
And what could be better
than what we do anyway?

42:37.295 --> 42:39.015
Jesus, kid.

42:39.015 --> 42:43.535
How many people get to put the world
to rights and have fun doing it!?

42:45.175 --> 42:48.095
Huh? Jackson, don't,
don't drive her anywhere!

42:49.295 --> 42:51.135
Hey!

42:51.135 --> 42:53.535
Where do you think you're gonna go?

45:45.415 --> 45:47.255
I'm so scared of tomorrow.

45:51.095 --> 45:52.415
We're fine.

45:53.975 --> 45:55.015
It's over.
