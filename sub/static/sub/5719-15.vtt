WEBVTT

00:01.923 --> 00:03.528
- Whoa boy!
- She said that she could jump him!

00:03.648 --> 00:04.768
She said that I was the problem!

00:04.888 --> 00:07.625
I just hope that nasty
gash doesn't leave a scar.

00:07.745 --> 00:09.276
I guess we'll just have to see.

00:09.396 --> 00:13.812
A spreadsheet is actually why I agreed
to go out with you today.

00:13.932 --> 00:17.082
It worked for choosing a school
why not for finding a guy.

00:17.202 --> 00:19.124
- You know how crazy that sounds, right?
- Yes.

00:19.244 --> 00:21.219
Billy listen, I think I
might have been a little hasty

00:21.339 --> 00:23.273
turning down that job.

00:24.387 --> 00:27.486
Yeah. Well, I think I'd like
to take you up on your offer.

00:27.606 --> 00:29.662
- I won?!
- Yeah! You won!

00:29.782 --> 00:33.710
Llama boy!

00:46.844 --> 00:48.846
Amy!

00:57.124 --> 00:59.541
- Hey Mitch.
- Hey.

00:59.661 --> 01:01.179
So, how have you two been?

01:01.299 --> 01:03.927
Well, the bromance
continues, thanks to you.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.057
- Maverick here is back to his old self.
- You're just out checking cattle?

01:07.177 --> 01:09.729
Yeah. Jack thought they might need some
hay hauled up to them while he's away,

01:09.849 --> 01:11.350
but they seem like
they're doing fine to me.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.631
I know it's just been a few days,
but how're you liking the job?

01:14.751 --> 01:17.655
It's pretty great, actually.
That Jack's a good guy to work for.

01:17.775 --> 01:19.995
You know exactly what's expected of you.

01:20.115 --> 01:21.910
He left some pretty
detailed chore lists though.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.602
Oh, you think he's bad?

01:23.722 --> 01:25.499
- Just wait till you meet my sister.
- Oh, yeah?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.597
Yeah. She's pretty much
the queen of lists.

01:27.717 --> 01:30.438
Well, I guess, it's good
to be organized.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.928
I look forward to meeting her.
All right. I'll let you get back at her.

01:33.048 --> 01:35.219
All right. See ya.

01:35.339 --> 01:37.678
I have got to get my own place.

01:37.948 --> 01:42.650
Why? Living at home can't be that bad.
My mom's on my case twenty-four seven.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.453
We just really need some space
from each other right now.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.031
You think I could stay at
Heartland for a couple of days?

01:48.151 --> 01:50.702
Ah, yeah. You can probably
stay in Amy's old room.

01:50.822 --> 01:52.775
Lou gets home tonight you can
come for dinner and ask her.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.863
- Cool. Thanks.
- Order is up!

01:56.197 --> 01:58.000
You know, it's only been
opened just over a week,

01:58.120 --> 02:00.095
but I guess it's really catching on.

02:00.215 --> 02:02.295
Lou is going to freak.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.838
Well, I hear their
signature burger is to die for.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.256
We should check it out!

02:06.376 --> 02:09.642
Nah. The line's too long.
And I should probably get home.

02:11.785 --> 02:14.162
You know, looking at
your phone every ten seconds

02:14.282 --> 02:16.932
is not gonna make Adam
text you back any faster.

02:17.052 --> 02:19.895
I just don't understand,
I texted him hours ago.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.355
We're supposed to have a
tutoring session tomorrow.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.439
Okay, kid. What's really going on?

02:24.559 --> 02:26.641
This is not about tutoring.

02:26.761 --> 02:29.577
Okay. The last time I
saw him I may've kissed him.

02:29.697 --> 02:30.723
Whoa. Really?

02:30.843 --> 02:32.513
Yeah, but now I don't
know what's going on.

02:32.633 --> 02:35.701
And it's driving me crazy...
I haven't seen him all week.

02:35.821 --> 02:39.292
Ever since he got elected, he's been
doing all this class president stuff.

02:39.412 --> 02:41.573
He's all over my feed.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.341
Since when are those two friends?

02:45.461 --> 02:49.200
"Congrats to my worthy opponent, Olivia,
for making the extreme team!"

02:49.320 --> 02:52.061
And when did Olivia make the team?

02:56.304 --> 02:58.507
You're home! Hi.

02:58.627 --> 03:01.766
Hey! I just got here a few minutes ago!

03:02.676 --> 03:05.068
- So where are the girls?
- Georgie's out with Jade.

03:05.188 --> 03:08.260
And Katie is with Abraham.
But Vanessa is gonna drop her off.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.317
Oh yeah. No, no, no.
I got some errands to do

03:10.437 --> 03:13.374
- I'll just run by and scoop her up.
- Okay. How was your trip?

03:13.494 --> 03:17.691
Ah, New York just never disappoints.
The food, the wine, the shopping.

03:17.811 --> 03:20.493
I spent an entire day at
a spa, just being pampered.

03:20.613 --> 03:22.257
That sounds like
exactly what you need it.

03:22.377 --> 03:24.831
It was. I feel totally rejuvenated.

03:24.951 --> 03:27.789
And you know, this trip honestly
helped me gain a fresh perspective.

03:27.909 --> 03:29.838
- On what?
- Just life.

03:29.958 --> 03:33.208
Realizing that it is okay to
be single and career-oriented.

03:33.328 --> 03:35.308
A lot of my girlfriends
out there are unattached

03:35.428 --> 03:38.207
and they're just fine.
You know, better than fine.

03:38.327 --> 03:41.847
Anyway, I just don't need a man in
my life complicating things right now.

03:41.967 --> 03:45.432
I just wanna focus
on work and the girls.

03:46.528 --> 03:48.849
Lacey? Hey there.

03:48.969 --> 03:51.121
I'm sorry to just drop
by without calling first.

03:51.241 --> 03:54.059
- Is Budget Buster okay?
- He's doing just fine. Thanks.

03:54.179 --> 03:58.147
I'm here about Olivia, actually.
She just made the extreme team.

03:58.267 --> 04:01.667
- Oh... That's great.
- It's very exciting.

04:01.787 --> 04:03.753
Um, I've been talking with
her coach, and Olivia

04:03.873 --> 04:06.546
- is going to learn to roman ride.
- Really?

04:06.666 --> 04:09.818
I'm wondering if you'd be willing
to help her get a bit of a head start?

04:09.938 --> 04:12.795
Uh, I don't think I should
be the one you're talking to.

04:12.915 --> 04:15.988
Oh, nonsense. Trudie said that you did
an amazing job with Georgie.

04:16.108 --> 04:18.510
Yeah, it's just I don't
know if it's a good idea.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.663
Look, Olivia is going to
learn one way or the other.

04:20.783 --> 04:22.754
That's fine, I just
don't feel comfortable.

04:22.874 --> 04:23.890
And I didn't really feel comfortable

04:24.010 --> 04:27.378
when Georgie rode Budget Buster
without permission and injured him.

04:27.498 --> 04:31.847
- I think you owe us this.
- She would need to find horses.

04:31.883 --> 04:35.155
We bought Olivia two new trick horses.
They both have roman riding experience.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.931
- All right.
- So? Is that a yes?

04:41.351 --> 04:42.599
Excellent!

04:42.719 --> 04:45.355
I can't wait to tell Olivia the news!
She'll be thrilled.

04:45.475 --> 04:47.103
When can I bring her by?

04:47.223 --> 04:48.868
I'll have to check my schedule

04:48.988 --> 04:51.252
and I would like to work
with the horses first.

04:51.372 --> 04:54.915
No problem. They're both on the trailer.
I'll leave them with you...

04:55.035 --> 04:57.954
as long as you don't let them get hurt.

04:58.074 --> 05:01.218
Let me know when you're ready
for her. How is tomorrow?

05:01.338 --> 05:03.563
Yeah. tomorrow will be fine.

05:08.617 --> 05:11.176
Okay, let's do this.

05:17.749 --> 05:19.878
Step up.

05:21.624 --> 05:23.431
Come on, step up.

05:26.742 --> 05:28.818
That's it.

05:42.402 --> 05:44.363
Hey. Whatcha you doing?

05:44.483 --> 05:46.234
Olivia's step-mom dropped by...

05:46.354 --> 05:49.189
Yeah, I heard, you know,
she made the extreme team.

05:49.309 --> 05:52.753
Yeah, and these are her new horses.

05:52.873 --> 05:56.062
Lacey asked me if I can teach
Olivia how to roman ride.

05:57.203 --> 05:59.259
I can't believe you'd do this.

05:59.379 --> 06:03.535
Georgie! Wait!
Look, just let me explain!

06:21.675 --> 06:23.487
Oh.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.418
Hello?! Hello!

06:32.705 --> 06:35.333
Yeah. Hold on! Hold on a second.

06:40.574 --> 06:44.300
- You?!
- Spreadsheet!

07:25.051 --> 07:26.497
What're you doing here?

07:26.617 --> 07:29.612
Why... why are you
camping out on my property?

07:29.732 --> 07:31.635
Your property? Ah...

07:31.755 --> 07:34.480
I'm Heartland's new ranch
hand. Jack Bartlett hired me.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.139
Jack Bartlett is my grandfather
and I know nothing about a ranch hand.

07:38.259 --> 07:39.744
- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.

07:39.864 --> 07:41.310
Okay. Look, I don't
know what's going on here.

07:41.430 --> 07:43.548
But I had no idea that the uptight woman

07:43.668 --> 07:45.864
I went for a walk with, had
any connection with Heartland.

07:45.984 --> 07:48.859
Okay. I'm not uptight...
And how could you not know?

07:48.979 --> 07:51.040
Well, you didn't
mentioned it in your profile

07:51.076 --> 07:52.472
and the date was kinda
short, if you remember...

07:52.592 --> 07:54.748
Yeah. Whose fault was that?

07:55.622 --> 07:58.118
Look sorry. I just... I think this
is just a big misunderstanding.

07:58.238 --> 08:00.865
- You can't park your trailer here.
- Jack said that I could.

08:00.985 --> 08:02.967
Well, is my property,
so I call the shots.

08:03.087 --> 08:04.635
And I have guests booked
to stay here next week.

08:04.755 --> 08:07.956
And I can't have them
looking at this... eyesore.

08:08.076 --> 08:09.758
Just talk to Jack, okay?
He'll clear this up.

08:09.878 --> 08:12.555
Yeah. I'll talk to him all right...
because this isn't going to work.

08:12.675 --> 08:14.846
You have 48 hours to get
that trailer off my property.

08:14.966 --> 08:18.448
- Two days? That's not gonna happen.
- Suit yourself. I'll have it towed.

08:18.568 --> 08:21.913
Cut me some slack, okay?
I don't have any place to park it.

08:22.033 --> 08:25.907
Look, I'm sorry, but
that's not my problem.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.741
Georgie...

08:36.861 --> 08:39.725
It isn't bad enough that she's
on the team... now she's roman riding?

08:39.845 --> 08:42.404
Lacey already talked to your coach
it sounds like it's a done deal.

08:42.524 --> 08:45.394
Yeah, but why do you have to train her?
She's a horrible person!

08:45.514 --> 08:47.508
- Hey.
- No. Don't you remember last year

08:47.628 --> 08:50.179
at the extreme team tryouts?
She pretended to be my friend,

08:50.299 --> 08:51.881
and then completely
stole my signature move!

08:52.001 --> 08:55.119
- Yes, I remember that...
- Then it was the reverse fender drag,

08:55.239 --> 08:59.099
and now it's roman riding! She's
always coping me. And you know that!

08:59.219 --> 09:03.359
You're right. I do. And that's why
I told Lacey that it wasn't a good idea.

09:03.479 --> 09:06.146
Well, then I don't get it.
Why are you doing it?

09:06.266 --> 09:10.499
Because she brought up what
happened when Budget Buster was here.

09:10.619 --> 09:14.903
Look, I know I shouldn't have ridden
him. and I'm really sorry he got hurt.

09:15.023 --> 09:18.485
I know you are, but that
was really serious, Georgie.

09:18.605 --> 09:21.050
And Lacey and Olivia
were really good about it

09:21.170 --> 09:24.324
that it felt impossible
to say no to this.

09:26.342 --> 09:29.303
Grandpa, I need to talk
to you about the new hire.

09:29.423 --> 09:31.838
I can't believe you didn't
discuss it with me first.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.324
Don't forget your backpack, sweetie.

09:33.444 --> 09:36.894
And there's no way he can park
his trailer at the Dude Ranch.

09:37.014 --> 09:39.592
It's... so please just call me back.

09:39.712 --> 09:45.318
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey, sweetheart! I missed you so much.

09:48.076 --> 09:49.220
Is everything okay?

09:49.340 --> 09:51.737
Yeah, I'm just really glad you're back.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.542
Me too.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.056
It was nice of you to cook, Jade.

09:58.176 --> 10:00.280
Well, it's the least I
could do since I was hoping

10:00.400 --> 10:02.853
that I could stay in Amy's
old room for a couple of days?

10:02.973 --> 10:04.565
Things are kinda tense
between me and Mom right now.

10:04.685 --> 10:07.668
You're welcome to stay. At least
somebody around here checks me first.

10:07.788 --> 10:09.803
I really think you need
to give Mitch a chance.

10:09.923 --> 10:11.671
You know, I cannot believe
Grandpa would hire him

10:11.791 --> 10:13.173
without consulting me first.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.041
That was a family decision.

10:15.161 --> 10:16.442
And that junky trailer?

10:16.562 --> 10:18.658
Why would he let him park
that at the Dude Ranch?

10:18.778 --> 10:21.391
I'm trying to run a business.
And appearances count, right?

10:21.511 --> 10:23.097
Georgie, Katie... dinner!

10:23.217 --> 10:25.719
Lou! Listen!
Mitch is a good guy.

10:25.839 --> 10:27.887
I got to know him when I
worked with his horse, okay?

10:28.007 --> 10:31.141
He's a veteran, he's hard
working, he's trustworthy...

10:31.261 --> 10:34.157
Trustworthy?!
You don't know the half of it.

10:34.277 --> 10:36.887
I mean, how can you possibly know that?

10:37.007 --> 10:39.784
Look. I just don't think
it's gonna work, okay?

10:39.904 --> 10:42.371
A full-time ranch hand
affects the bottom line.

10:42.491 --> 10:45.104
- What do you think, Dad?
- It's not a bad idea.

10:45.224 --> 10:47.473
See? Even he agrees with Grandpa.

10:47.593 --> 10:49.642
No. I didn't say that.

10:49.762 --> 10:52.095
I'm just saying you girls might
need a little more help around here.

10:52.215 --> 10:54.673
Why? We've been managing fine so far.

10:54.793 --> 10:56.815
Well, Jack's not getting any younger.

10:56.935 --> 10:59.669
And I'm not always gonna be
around to help pick up the slack.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.721
Are you going on the circuit with
Casey again? You just got back.

11:02.841 --> 11:06.476
No. I... I'm busy. I got
a lot of things on my plate.

11:06.596 --> 11:10.659
Like Jade; we gotta look at
this sponsorship thing again.

11:10.779 --> 11:13.605
- Well, why the sudden rush?
- Why not?

11:13.725 --> 11:17.068
If you know what you want
in life you gotta go for it.

11:17.188 --> 11:19.689
So, you up for a
strategy meeting tomorrow?

11:20.232 --> 11:22.807
- Sure.
- You know, Dad, you're right.

11:22.927 --> 11:24.367
And I'm feeling the same way too.

11:24.487 --> 11:27.897
It's time for new
challenges. New opportunities.

11:27.932 --> 11:29.681
See? Right there.
That's what I'm talking about.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.240
Just not new hired help.

11:43.305 --> 11:45.063
That's a nice one.

11:45.183 --> 11:48.065
Yeah great, but the rent's way too high.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.552
There is no way I can
afford any of these.

11:50.672 --> 11:52.454
And Mom's already pays for my truck.

11:52.574 --> 11:54.489
I can't ask her to
help pay for rent too.

11:54.609 --> 11:57.241
Especially since it's
my idea to move out.

11:57.361 --> 11:59.779
So what are you gonna do?

12:00.685 --> 12:02.771
I have to get a part-time job.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.116
Did he finally text you back?

12:06.236 --> 12:09.137
Yeah. Looks like he's free
for the tutoring tomorrow.

12:09.257 --> 12:11.454
So how are you going to handle this?

12:11.574 --> 12:13.190
Handle what?

12:13.310 --> 12:15.525
C'mon, Georgie. Talk about awkward.

12:15.645 --> 12:18.361
I mean, you kissed him...
you haven't seen llama boy since,

12:18.481 --> 12:20.796
and now he's mister popularity.

12:20.916 --> 12:24.033
You saw that photo of him and Olivia.
What's the deal with that?

12:24.153 --> 12:27.737
There is no deal.
Are you sure about that?

12:27.857 --> 12:30.421
Don't worry, I've got this.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.327
Cool. I'll leave you to it then.

12:35.698 --> 12:38.114
Oh, Lou, you're not
doing work already, are you?

12:38.234 --> 12:41.583
It was nice to get away but now
I have a ton to get caught up on.

12:41.703 --> 12:44.192
And I have to factor in a ranch
hand on the Heartland payroll.

12:44.312 --> 12:47.415
We've always managed to pay Caleb.
I don't see what's the difference is?

12:47.535 --> 12:49.998
It's been a while since Caleb
worked here with any regularity.

12:50.118 --> 12:53.719
And costs have gone way up since then,
but our fees haven't.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.671
Okay. You'll figure it out.
Even Dad thought it was a good idea.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.325
I have to admit, it wasn't the
reaction I expected him to have.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.849
Katie wouldn't let me leave
until I promised to take her riding.

13:02.969 --> 13:04.879
She has you wrapped around
her finger. You know that?

13:04.999 --> 13:07.882
- Well...
- This can't be right...

13:08.002 --> 13:09.850
Have you checked in at
Maggie's since you got back?

13:09.970 --> 13:12.998
I was.. I was planning on it.
This week... yeah.

13:13.118 --> 13:16.387
Our weekly sales figures...
it's a third of the normal take.

13:16.507 --> 13:19.241
- It's probably that food truck.
- What food truck?

13:19.361 --> 13:21.505
Bandit Burger. It's been
opened about a week now,

13:21.625 --> 13:23.226
across the street from Maggie's.

13:23.346 --> 13:26.897
It was super busy this afternoon.
Line up down the block.

13:35.725 --> 13:38.454
What?! When did this happen?

13:39.344 --> 13:41.305
That's great news, Cassandra!

13:41.425 --> 13:43.025
Yeah, we'll have to celebrate?

13:43.145 --> 13:46.261
Ty is actually visiting his mom right
now. So maybe when he gets back?

13:46.381 --> 13:48.424
Okay. Bye.

13:48.544 --> 13:50.364
What's going on with Cass?

13:50.484 --> 13:52.266
Well, Caleb moved in with her.

13:52.386 --> 13:54.995
I guess things are
getting pretty serious.

13:55.115 --> 13:59.641
- So when's Olivia getting here?
- She should be here any minute.

13:59.761 --> 14:02.928
Hey Amy, did Cass say what
Caleb was doing with his trailer?

14:03.048 --> 14:04.919
Uh, no. Why?

14:05.039 --> 14:07.296
Can I grab his number from you?

14:14.442 --> 14:17.158
So I guess you heard?
Isn't it great?

14:17.278 --> 14:19.526
I'm glad to see you aren't
taking your epic defeat too hard.

14:19.646 --> 14:22.634
As class president?
Please, I'm so over that.

14:22.754 --> 14:24.321
Actually, you know,
it's lucky that I lost.

14:24.441 --> 14:26.482
Now I'll have more time to
focus on the extreme team.

14:26.602 --> 14:28.866
Great. Well, I'll see you at practice.

14:28.986 --> 14:31.954
- You're not sticking around?
- No. I have a tutoring session.

14:32.074 --> 14:35.060
It must be nice to finally
have a popular friend.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.592
Yeah. No thanks to you.

14:36.712 --> 14:38.927
Are you still upset
about that stupid video?

14:39.047 --> 14:41.384
Get over it. Okay? Adam
has tons of friends now.

14:41.504 --> 14:44.317
I did him a big favour.
And Adam thinks so too.

14:45.894 --> 14:49.155
Wait. Do you like,
"like" him, or something?

14:49.275 --> 14:53.717
No! No, it's not like that!
But he is my friend.

14:54.225 --> 14:56.085
Whatever.

14:59.490 --> 15:03.342
All right. You ready? I'll hold
them while you get into position.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.829
That's it. Now stand up.

15:12.359 --> 15:13.928
I can't...

15:14.048 --> 15:16.828
Sure you can. I've got the horses.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.870
You're fine.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.561
Okay. Now take your reins.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.897
You all right?

15:32.017 --> 15:34.848
I don't think I can do this.

15:35.246 --> 15:37.618
I'm just gonna walk nice and slow. Okay?

15:37.738 --> 15:39.152
I have the horses. It's all right.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.721
It's all about having
a stable foundation.

15:40.841 --> 15:44.288
You'll be fine.
Okay. Step up.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.933
Okay now. Keep looking forward.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.853
Agh. Oh.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.878
That's okay. We'll
just... We'll go again.

16:05.239 --> 16:07.164
This is supposed to be our lunch rush.

16:07.284 --> 16:09.493
Where is everyone?

16:09.613 --> 16:11.520
Over there.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.065
Don't panic, honey. They'll come back.

16:15.185 --> 16:18.908
Yeah? When? You know, our bottom line
can't sustain an empty diner very long.

16:19.028 --> 16:20.983
You know, that guy doesn't
have the same overhead we do.

16:21.103 --> 16:24.013
He doesn't have staff,
or plates, or tables,

16:24.133 --> 16:26.349
or even chairs!

16:26.469 --> 16:28.573
I'm gonna go check it out.

16:28.693 --> 16:30.387
That's what I'm gonna do.

16:30.507 --> 16:33.310
- Whoa. Where is everybody?
- Don't ask.

16:33.430 --> 16:38.882
I guess now wouldn't be the best time
to hit you up for a part-time job?

16:39.530 --> 16:42.498
I can't make our strategy session.

16:43.261 --> 16:44.763
Why not?

16:44.883 --> 16:47.902
I'm gonna meet Caleb.
I'm gonna rent his trailer.

16:49.059 --> 16:50.339
Where's Caleb going?

16:50.459 --> 16:53.430
Well, he is moving
in with his girlfriend.

16:54.479 --> 16:57.408
So you really wanna live
all the way out there alone?

16:57.528 --> 17:00.516
- Can you even afford it?
- Well, I need a part-time job.

17:00.636 --> 17:03.560
A regular job is not gonna
give you enough time to train.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.954
I gonna have to cut back
a bit on our training...

17:06.074 --> 17:07.789
No, that's not gonna cut it.

17:07.909 --> 17:12.733
- Jade you gotta work harder than ever.
- I really need a place of my own.

17:12.853 --> 17:16.604
Okay. so you've made
up your mind in this.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.604
I have.

17:19.653 --> 17:21.863
Well, that's too bad.

17:22.972 --> 17:27.547
Guess I was wrong about you...
you don't want it bad enough.

17:29.470 --> 17:32.662
- Thank you.
- Excuse me? Sorry.

17:32.782 --> 17:36.799
I'm just gonna pop through here.
Uh, excuse me!

17:36.919 --> 17:38.201
I'm sorry but you're gonna
have go to the back of the line.

17:38.321 --> 17:39.769
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not a customer...

17:39.889 --> 17:41.738
I own Maggie's. It's
just across the street.

17:41.858 --> 17:43.527
I couldn't help but
notice that this truck

17:43.647 --> 17:46.460
is interfering with street
parking and pedestrians access.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.529
We're abiding by the town bylaws.

17:48.649 --> 17:51.147
Well, that may be, but you know,

17:51.267 --> 17:53.178
idling engines have
been known to contribute

17:53.298 --> 17:55.018
to a number of different
health problems.

17:55.138 --> 17:57.086
Wanna try a hotdog? It's on the house.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.354
Uh, no. What I want to
know is how you get away

17:59.474 --> 18:02.024
with charging these
astronomical prices! Oh my God.

18:02.144 --> 18:05.412
That sounds like sour grapes.
I'm gonna have to ask you to step back.

18:05.532 --> 18:07.899
I've got actual customers to serve.

18:08.019 --> 18:10.447
Maybe you should try minding
your own business, and not mine.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.534
- I have legitimate concerns!
- Okay.

18:12.654 --> 18:16.705
I'm a local business owner.
And I have every right to voice.

18:16.825 --> 18:18.861
What are you doing?

18:18.981 --> 18:21.772
I'm saving you from
embarrassing yourself.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.965
Are you following me?

18:24.085 --> 18:26.384
Are you serious? I have work to do.

18:26.504 --> 18:29.937
I'm here to pick up the feed,
as per my job description.

18:30.766 --> 18:33.205
Listen, let me make
something clear, okay?

18:33.325 --> 18:36.008
Since it seems like you're
gonna be sticking around.

18:36.128 --> 18:40.095
Nobody in my family needs to know
anything about our little date. Okay?

18:40.215 --> 18:42.999
No problem. Nothing to know.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.663
Stay focused.

18:54.783 --> 18:56.869
There you go.

18:57.898 --> 18:59.832
AGH! Oof!

19:02.309 --> 19:05.304
Olivia! Hey. You okay?

19:05.424 --> 19:07.739
I'm fine.
It's no big deal.

19:07.859 --> 19:10.796
It happens all the time when you
first start out. Just ask Georgie.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.335
You know, I'm sick of hearing
about Georgie and how great she is!

19:13.455 --> 19:15.862
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. Just forget about it.

19:15.982 --> 19:18.277
No. Hey Olivia.

19:19.019 --> 19:20.885
What is going on with you?

19:21.005 --> 19:22.976
You can talk to me.

19:23.771 --> 19:27.291
No. I can't. I should go...

19:29.159 --> 19:31.082
Olivia!

19:32.098 --> 19:33.900
Sorry I was late.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.681
Yeah. What's up with that?

19:35.801 --> 19:38.636
I was hanging out with the guys
and I totally lost track of time.

19:38.756 --> 19:40.119
So you have "guys" now?

19:40.239 --> 19:42.595
This class president
thing has really blown up.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.841
Yeah. I noticed.

19:44.961 --> 19:47.607
So you're friends with Olivia now too?

19:47.727 --> 19:49.212
I saw that picture you posted

19:49.332 --> 19:51.782
congratulating her on
making the extreme team.

19:51.902 --> 19:54.013
She's more like a sorta friend.

19:54.133 --> 19:55.592
She said she was sorry about the video.

19:55.712 --> 19:58.283
And I thought that
was a cool thing to do.

19:58.403 --> 19:59.471
It would've been even cooler

19:59.591 --> 20:01.685
if she hadn't released
it in the first place.

20:01.805 --> 20:03.449
Or maybe you think she
did you a huge favour,

20:03.569 --> 20:06.294
because you got all
these cool friends now?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.712
It's not about that...

20:07.832 --> 20:10.347
I just don't see the
point in holding a grudge.

20:10.467 --> 20:13.501
- Olivia's not so bad...
- You have got to be kidding.

20:13.621 --> 20:17.307
What's up with you?
Why are you so bugged by Olivia?

20:17.427 --> 20:19.057
Do you think I "like" her, or something?

20:19.177 --> 20:21.678
I don't care if you do.

20:21.798 --> 20:25.373
So then this has nothing to do
with what happened the other day?

20:25.493 --> 20:27.183
You mean that kiss?

20:27.303 --> 20:29.537
It didn't mean anything.

20:29.657 --> 20:32.087
Then why'd you do it?

20:32.418 --> 20:36.158
- People kiss all the time.
- Yeah, right.

20:36.426 --> 20:38.710
It was no big deal.
At least not to me.

20:38.830 --> 20:43.384
So I don't know why you're
still thinking about it 'cause I'm not.

20:49.099 --> 20:50.966
_

20:51.086 --> 20:52.690
I've gotta go.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.525
But we haven't even
been working for that long.

20:54.645 --> 20:57.497
That's not my fault.
You were late.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.476
I see... okay.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.167
Thank you.

21:06.089 --> 21:09.005
- So...
- So...

21:09.125 --> 21:11.928
What did you two talk about?

21:13.429 --> 21:14.577
Feed...

21:14.697 --> 21:16.854
Thanks for helping me load
that truck, Tim. Appreciate it.

21:16.974 --> 21:19.042
Yeah. No a problem.

21:19.162 --> 21:23.787
- Any word on that food truck?
- Ah, they are abiding by town bylaws.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.325
They're more than 25 meters
away from open restaurants

21:26.445 --> 21:30.389
and they're not interfering
with pedestrian traffic so...

21:30.509 --> 21:33.546
Anyway, I have to go pick up Katie.
Can you keep an eye on things here?

21:33.666 --> 21:36.666
I'll pick Katie up. Let me do it.
I promised her a ride.

21:36.786 --> 21:40.776
Okay. Thanks, Dad.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

21:41.957 --> 21:45.594
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Likewise. You too.

21:47.662 --> 21:50.296
- Maybe it is sour grapes.
- What?

21:50.416 --> 21:52.828
I mean, people obviously
seem to like their food.

21:52.948 --> 21:55.420
Why you wanna eat standing
up is beyond me but...

21:55.540 --> 21:57.637
maybe I need to change
things up around here.

21:57.757 --> 22:01.630
I mean, Smokey and the Bandit
Burger, Reservoir Hotdogs

22:01.750 --> 22:03.591
with a side of Citizen Kale salad.

22:03.711 --> 22:06.499
- It's kind of fun, right?
- Forget gimmicks. Look...

22:06.619 --> 22:08.173
You just gotta wait it out.

22:08.293 --> 22:11.617
Places like this they're the hot go-to
spot right now, but then it's over.

22:11.737 --> 22:13.552
Or they run into
problems with regulation.

22:13.672 --> 22:17.024
I hear one big problem is
access to potable water.

22:17.144 --> 22:20.426
Water that's safe to drink?
I doubt that's an issue.

22:20.546 --> 22:22.494
Besides what do you
know about this stuff?

22:22.614 --> 22:24.858
I know things. I get around.

22:24.978 --> 22:27.179
Yeah. Clearly.

22:27.299 --> 22:29.822
- Look, I was only trying to help.
- You want to help?

22:29.942 --> 22:32.370
Get your trailer off my property.

22:32.490 --> 22:35.668
Wow. You're something, you know that?

22:35.788 --> 22:38.856
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:44.351 --> 22:46.854
- Hey Dad.
- Hey.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.519
I thought I take Katie for a ride.

22:48.639 --> 22:51.429
I thought you had
a meeting with Jade?

22:51.549 --> 22:55.408
Oh, Jade's got more important
things to do with her time.

22:55.528 --> 22:59.145
Yeah. Looks like she's been
wasting mine for months.

22:59.265 --> 23:03.388
- Okay. What's going on with you?
- Me? Nothing.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.647
Wait. Did something happen
on the circuit with Casey?

23:07.981 --> 23:09.974
No. Why do you ask that?

23:10.094 --> 23:12.291
I don't know, you've
just been a little off.

23:12.411 --> 23:15.835
Like when Lou asked
you about it at dinner.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.783
Well, I wasn't with Casey.
I was in Texas.

23:22.403 --> 23:25.955
- You were in Texas?
- Yeah, I got a job offer

23:26.075 --> 23:29.325
from a junior college to
coach their rodeo coach.

23:29.445 --> 23:33.111
Wow. That's... That's amazing, Dad!

23:33.231 --> 23:36.912
Yeah. I went down to talk
to them about it. Check it out.

23:37.534 --> 23:39.335
So you're going then?

23:39.455 --> 23:43.939
I'm waiting on the official
call so... it looks that way.

23:45.636 --> 23:47.725
Wow.

23:47.845 --> 23:50.920
Uh, is Casey gonna go with you then.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.894
No.

23:55.056 --> 23:57.220
I guess this explains why

23:57.340 --> 24:00.022
you've been rushing things
with Jade, getting a sponsor.

24:00.142 --> 24:01.989
Yeah. Jade was...

24:02.109 --> 24:06.535
the one good thing that I thought was
happening with the rodeo school but...

24:06.655 --> 24:09.565
If she doesn't want it bad enough
it doesn't matter that I'm going.

24:09.685 --> 24:12.768
Dad, come on.
Jade is a teenager.

24:12.888 --> 24:16.413
She's just getting her
first taste of freedom.

24:17.152 --> 24:20.093
Have you even told her you're leaving?

24:24.004 --> 24:27.310
- I think maybe you should.
- Yeah. I will.

24:29.619 --> 24:33.245
So when is it that you go?

24:33.365 --> 24:36.019
Probably within a few weeks.

24:37.661 --> 24:40.595
- Have you told Lou?
- No. Not yet.

24:40.715 --> 24:44.998
She's got a busy schedule.
I'll tell her soon.

24:47.303 --> 24:49.153
I really cannot...

24:49.886 --> 24:52.639
I can't believe you're going.

24:52.901 --> 24:55.205
I'm really gonna miss you.

25:01.055 --> 25:03.144
Pretty sweet setup, huh?

25:03.264 --> 25:05.776
And now that I've scored this place,
I think I'm gonna throw a party.

25:05.896 --> 25:09.313
- Like a trailer-warming party?
- Yeah. Like that.

25:09.433 --> 25:11.516
I'm thinking tomorrow
night. You should come.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.815
You should bring whoever you want.

25:13.935 --> 25:16.754
- Like who?
- Like Adam.

25:16.874 --> 25:20.446
I don't know. Things with
him are kind of weird right now.

25:21.211 --> 25:22.577
He's got all these new friends.

25:22.697 --> 25:24.513
And it's like he's forgetting
who his real ones are.

25:24.633 --> 25:27.225
Sounds like this class president
thing is going to his head.

25:27.345 --> 25:30.175
It gets worse.
He was saying how Olivia is not so bad,

25:30.295 --> 25:33.297
and I kind of lost it.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.223
I told him the kiss
didn't mean anything.

25:35.343 --> 25:38.575
And I think he might've actually
liked me, but doesn't matter now

25:38.695 --> 25:40.984
because I completely
messed everything up!

25:41.104 --> 25:43.998
Well, that's why this
party is such a genius idea.

25:44.118 --> 25:46.360
It's low pressure, so you
guys can just hang out.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.702
See what happens.
Come on. I'll take care of everything.

25:48.822 --> 25:51.658
All you have to do is
show up. What do you think?

25:57.347 --> 25:59.795
Good night, sweetheart.

26:03.519 --> 26:06.541
- Hello?!
- Hey. I'm in here.

26:07.623 --> 26:09.295
Hi.

26:09.415 --> 26:11.369
- You helped Jade move in?
- Yeah.

26:11.489 --> 26:14.655
Actually she's having a party
tomorrow night to celebrate...

26:14.775 --> 26:17.778
- You haven't even let me finish.
- That's because you're not going.

26:17.898 --> 26:21.668
- Why? It'll just be a few friends.
- Yeah. A few older friends.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.999
They're not all gonna
be older. Adam's going...

26:24.119 --> 26:25.906
Look, I know all about Jade's parties.

26:26.026 --> 26:28.107
And you're just gonna
have to sit this one out.

26:28.227 --> 26:30.722
You don't care if I ever have
any friends or not, do you?!

26:35.040 --> 26:37.817
Oh, I'm glad to hear
your mom is doing so well.

26:38.224 --> 26:40.435
- Yeah.
- Hey.

26:40.555 --> 26:44.122
Okay... I will.
I love you. Bye.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.776
Oh, that bad, huh?

26:48.896 --> 26:51.296
Only a handful of customers today.

26:51.416 --> 26:54.158
And I just got into a
big fight with Georgie.

26:54.278 --> 26:56.403
She wants to go to this
party at Jade's house.

26:56.523 --> 26:58.185
Apparently Adam might be going,

26:58.305 --> 26:59.805
but I know there is gonna
be college kids there

26:59.925 --> 27:03.093
so there's no way I
can allow that, right?

27:03.213 --> 27:06.538
Well, sounds like Georgie
had a pretty tough day too.

27:06.658 --> 27:11.532
- Why? What's going on?
- No party, and Olivia.

27:11.652 --> 27:13.252
I knew, I shouldn't
have agreed to coach her.

27:13.372 --> 27:17.544
Yeah. Well, Olivia can be...
challenging.

27:17.664 --> 27:20.024
Yeah, but it's not just that.

27:20.144 --> 27:23.183
It's almost like she's lost
her confidence or something.

27:23.303 --> 27:24.567
Well, that wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

27:24.687 --> 27:27.714
- Lou!
- I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

27:27.834 --> 27:30.050
And I think Georgie
and Adam had an argument

27:30.170 --> 27:32.069
when he was here today.

27:32.189 --> 27:35.652
I don't think Adam being her
tutor is a good idea anymore.

27:35.772 --> 27:37.675
Georgie has a little
bit of a crush on him.

27:37.795 --> 27:40.378
A little bit?!
Why? What happened?

27:40.498 --> 27:43.829
While you were gone,
Adam tried to kiss Georgie.

27:43.949 --> 27:45.231
He did what?!

27:45.351 --> 27:48.536
Yeah, but she handled it.
It was no big deal.

27:48.656 --> 27:51.904
But then, she surprised
Adam by kissing him.

27:52.024 --> 27:55.337
This is the first I'm hearing of this?!
Why didn't she say anything to me?!

27:55.457 --> 27:58.621
Lou, you didn't run home and
tell Mom about your first kiss.

27:58.741 --> 28:00.497
I know, but that is
hardly the point, Amy. Okay.

28:00.617 --> 28:03.775
I need to know what's
happening in my daughter's life!

28:03.895 --> 28:06.528
And what's going on with everyone?
Why is everyone trying to kiss someone?!

28:06.648 --> 28:08.237
What do you mean?

28:08.357 --> 28:12.357
Mitch... He tried to kiss me.

28:12.477 --> 28:14.156
Are you kidding me?!
When did this happen?

28:14.276 --> 28:18.147
Before he worked here.
He was one of my infamous online dates.

28:18.267 --> 28:20.850
OMG! Okay, I need details.

28:20.970 --> 28:22.967
Okay. But you have to
promise to keep it to yourself.

28:23.087 --> 28:27.477
And I don't tell Dad because he
actually seems to like the guy.

28:27.597 --> 28:29.826
Yeah. It kinda makes sense

28:29.946 --> 28:32.194
why Dad would want
Mitch to work out though.

28:32.314 --> 28:34.176
Why?

28:34.296 --> 28:36.887
Dad was gonna tell you but...

28:45.409 --> 28:48.015
Everything's set.
He said yes. You have to come!

28:48.135 --> 28:50.955
I really want to, but I...

28:51.075 --> 28:52.914
I gotta go.

28:53.034 --> 28:54.777
- Who was that?
- Jade.

28:54.897 --> 28:57.916
Adam's definitely going to her party.

28:59.761 --> 29:03.426
Look, I know how
important this is to you...

29:03.546 --> 29:05.093
I have to be there.

29:05.213 --> 29:07.689
I need to fix things with
him. You don't get it.

29:07.809 --> 29:11.916
I get it more than
you think, Georgie.

29:13.129 --> 29:17.672
Believe it or not, I was
your age once too, okay?

29:17.792 --> 29:20.923
So? If you promise to
keep in touch by text...

29:21.043 --> 29:22.359
What? Seriously you're letting me go?

29:22.479 --> 29:26.378
Hold it. I am trusting
you here, Georgie.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.015
And I want you in by ten thirty...

29:28.135 --> 29:30.184
Ten thirty? The party will
just be getting started...

29:30.304 --> 29:32.661
Don't push it.

29:33.043 --> 29:35.109
Thank you.

29:58.986 --> 30:01.031
Hi girls.

30:01.151 --> 30:04.116
Grandpa, can you
drive me to ballet class?

30:04.236 --> 30:06.111
You bet I can.

30:06.231 --> 30:07.219
Why don't you go grab your slippers.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.469
And uh, I have to talk to
Grandpa alone for a minute.

30:09.589 --> 30:11.128
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:15.467 --> 30:17.008
Lou, there's something
that I need to...

30:17.128 --> 30:20.608
I know. I know about Texas.

30:23.095 --> 30:25.691
- Amy told you...
- It's okay.

30:25.962 --> 30:27.623
- I get it.
- You do?

30:27.743 --> 30:30.501
I mean, I'm not gonna
say I'm happy about it.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.601
But people have to move
on with their lives.

30:33.721 --> 30:35.787
Right?

30:48.212 --> 30:50.407
I wasn't sure you'd come back.

30:50.527 --> 30:52.728
Yeah, well, it's not like
I really have a lot of choice.

30:52.848 --> 30:56.255
- So? You wanna get them tacked up?
- Not until you tell me what's going on.

30:56.375 --> 30:59.730
- Maybe I can help.
- Well, you can't. Not with this.

31:01.016 --> 31:03.993
Look, you don't seem
like you wanna be here.

31:04.113 --> 31:07.845
And honestly from what I've seen,
you're not ready for roman riding.

31:07.965 --> 31:10.723
I have to be! Okay? That's all she
talks about! They bought me two horses!

31:10.843 --> 31:14.003
- That's all who talks about?
- My step-mom.

31:14.123 --> 31:17.653
- Look, just forget I said anything.
- I just need you to help me understand.

31:17.773 --> 31:21.031
Because I was there when you performed
the reverse fender drag a year ago.

31:21.151 --> 31:24.219
And you were amazing!
So where's that girl?

31:24.339 --> 31:28.503
I practiced really hard
for the tryouts all year.

31:28.623 --> 31:30.484
And I was so excited to
learn that I finally made it.

31:30.604 --> 31:35.524
- Well, it's a big accomplishment.
- Yeah, if it's for real...

31:35.644 --> 31:38.101
Why wouldn't it be?

31:38.221 --> 31:40.694
I overheard my step-mom
talking to the coach.

31:40.814 --> 31:42.651
It turns out my parents
made a really big donation

31:42.771 --> 31:45.057
right around the time of the tryouts.

31:45.177 --> 31:47.568
So you think that's the
only reason you made it?

31:47.688 --> 31:52.035
I'm not good enough, so they just bought
my way onto the team!

31:54.976 --> 31:57.351
Mmm.

31:58.586 --> 32:00.528
- Excuse me.
- Hm?

32:00.648 --> 32:03.316
What have you got there?

32:03.436 --> 32:07.990
Okay. You can't sit in my Diner
and eat food you bought somewhere else!

32:08.110 --> 32:11.924
No, no! That's it.
If you want to eat that, eat it outside!

32:13.428 --> 32:17.188
You know, Maggie's has
tables and chairs and bathrooms

32:17.308 --> 32:21.649
all of which all cost money to maintain!
Thank you very much.

32:21.769 --> 32:24.758
You know, I don't blame you
for wanting to sit down to eat!

32:24.878 --> 32:27.973
But maybe you think about that
the next time you're trying to decide

32:28.093 --> 32:31.150
where to buy your lunch! Okay?

32:31.270 --> 32:34.222
Really? Unbelievable!

32:36.798 --> 32:40.500
- Seriously? You too?
- Don't start, okay?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.546
I just came by to tell
you to call off the dogs.

32:42.666 --> 32:43.670
What dogs?

32:43.790 --> 32:46.595
My buddy came by today to haul
the trailer away. It's in storage.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.799
Storage? I thought you were
just moving it somewhere else?

32:48.919 --> 32:50.706
Well, I don't really
know where that would be,

32:50.826 --> 32:51.994
because I don't have any land.

32:52.114 --> 32:54.064
My parents sold their place,
they don't have any land.

32:54.184 --> 32:57.397
Bottom line is: I have
no place to put it...

32:58.383 --> 33:00.256
Wait? Where are you staying?

33:00.376 --> 33:04.460
I'm couch surfing... among other things.
What do you care anyways?

33:04.580 --> 33:07.321
You made it perfectly
clear it's not your problem.

33:12.354 --> 33:14.821
She thinks that's the only
reason she made the team.

33:14.941 --> 33:16.605
The donation had
nothing to do with it...

33:16.725 --> 33:20.327
I'm not the one who needs convincing.
I know how good Olivia is,

33:20.447 --> 33:21.944
but if she doesn't
rebuild her confidence

33:22.064 --> 33:24.901
then I'm afraid she
could get really hurt.

33:29.264 --> 33:31.399
I would be happy to work with her...

33:31.519 --> 33:33.254
you know, go back to basics.

33:33.374 --> 33:36.591
Thank you, Amy. For everything.

33:36.711 --> 33:38.794
I'm really sorry. Are you mad?

33:38.914 --> 33:42.966
No. I should be the one who's sorry.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.691
If you've come here to give me
another lecture on commitment,

33:58.811 --> 34:01.290
I think I'll take a pass.

34:02.036 --> 34:05.336
Yeah, I might have
been a little hard on you.

34:07.374 --> 34:09.456
The truth is, Jade...

34:09.577 --> 34:10.976
I was trying to fast-track things

34:11.096 --> 34:13.344
because an opportunity
has come up for me...

34:13.464 --> 34:17.014
- south of the border.
- You're leaving?

34:17.134 --> 34:20.333
I'm waiting on an official offer,
but yeah, it looks that way.

34:20.454 --> 34:23.053
- Are you closing the rodeo school?
- Yeah.

34:23.172 --> 34:26.139
So I was trying to help you
as much as I could before I left.

34:26.259 --> 34:28.293
So, you brought me all this
way and now you're dumping me?

34:28.413 --> 34:31.978
You're the one with
other priorities. Remember?

34:32.614 --> 34:34.632
This might be for the best.

34:34.752 --> 34:38.117
We'll each be doing what we
should be doing, for ourselves.

34:38.237 --> 34:41.253
- No hard feelings.
- You don't care about me at all...

34:41.373 --> 34:44.868
- Oh Jade, hold on a second.
- No! You hold on.

34:44.987 --> 34:48.627
You're rude, you're mean,
and you always have to be right

34:48.746 --> 34:50.746
but that's what makes you a good coach.

34:50.867 --> 34:54.288
Everybody got better because of you!
All the students talk about it.

34:54.408 --> 34:56.672
- They do?
- You said you believed in me.

34:56.792 --> 34:59.518
And now you're just
throwing in the towel?

35:00.959 --> 35:03.960
I'm gonna tell you this once.

35:04.254 --> 35:07.312
You're a natural.
This doesn't have to end here.

35:07.432 --> 35:10.019
You've got what it takes.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.426
You just have to decide if you want it.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.171
I do want it...

35:15.291 --> 35:18.425
but how am I supposed
to do it without you?

35:45.069 --> 35:48.737
Thanks for picking me up.
You think Adam's here yet?

35:50.240 --> 35:54.142
- I don't know.
- What's up with you tonight?

35:55.573 --> 35:59.663
I want to be a bronc rider.
But Tim's right.

35:59.783 --> 36:04.023
I don't have time to commit if I have
to juggle school, training and a job.

36:04.143 --> 36:05.861
So what are you going to do?

36:05.981 --> 36:08.515
I have to move back home
where it's rent-free.

36:08.635 --> 36:11.285
Maybe I get a sponsor
and things will change.

36:11.405 --> 36:15.935
But for now, at least I'll
have more time to practice.

36:20.321 --> 36:22.870
I'll be right back.

36:42.137 --> 36:44.045
I... I need to go!

36:44.322 --> 36:46.197
I'll drive you!

36:59.547 --> 37:02.121
Wow. You're home early.

37:03.074 --> 37:06.494
Georgie, what's wrong? Are you okay?

37:07.021 --> 37:11.599
- Georgie, what happened?
- Adam was at the party with Olivia.

37:11.719 --> 37:15.454
And I saw them and they
they were kissing...

37:16.395 --> 37:19.208
Oh, sweetheart. It's okay.

37:26.438 --> 37:28.544
- Ok.
- Why Grandpa is driving?

37:28.664 --> 37:31.435
Your grandfather offered
to drop you two off at school.

37:31.555 --> 37:34.350
- Indulge him, okay?
- Okay.

37:34.470 --> 37:37.152
I told Jade I'd help her pack up
the trailer after school, okay?

37:37.272 --> 37:40.670
Sure. Yeah, I'll
pick you up after work.

37:40.976 --> 37:44.559
Okay. See you at Maggie's.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.783
Buckle up.

38:08.150 --> 38:11.386
- Hey.
- Hey. Any word on that food truck?

38:11.506 --> 38:15.356
No. Business is still
really slow, but...

38:15.476 --> 38:17.658
Oh look, I've already got a
full slate today. I don't have...

38:17.778 --> 38:20.180
No, no. It's not work.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.730
A friend is looking for a
tenant to rent his trailer.

38:22.850 --> 38:26.233
And I called him on your behalf. Okay.
I mean, it beats couch surfing

38:26.353 --> 38:29.617
or wherever it is you're
sleeping these days.

38:29.737 --> 38:32.567
This is his address and phone number.

38:35.029 --> 38:36.677
This is in the middle of nowhere.

38:36.797 --> 38:40.018
Okay. This is what I get for feeling bad
and trying to help you out?

38:40.138 --> 38:42.037
Hey.

38:44.003 --> 38:48.662
Just call him or don't
call him. It's up to you.

39:01.454 --> 39:04.057
- Hey.
- Hey. Where did the food truck go?

39:04.177 --> 39:07.740
- Oh, they got a complaint.
- So they just left?

39:07.860 --> 39:11.577
- Something about potable water.
- Potable water? Really?

39:11.697 --> 39:15.647
- Yeah, does that mean something to you?
- Maybe...

39:15.767 --> 39:18.538
Well, whatever it was...
I guess Bandit Burger

39:18.658 --> 39:23.410
thought it was too much of a hassle
and they moved on.

39:25.134 --> 39:27.263
I gotta get to work.

39:33.018 --> 39:36.602
- So have you talked to Adam?
- No...

39:36.722 --> 39:39.972
- You guys almost done?
- Just one more load.

39:40.092 --> 39:42.908
- Need a hand?
- Ah, I think we're okay, actually.

39:43.028 --> 39:44.541
All right.

39:48.973 --> 39:50.815
So you decided to
check it out after all?

39:50.935 --> 39:53.346
Yeah, I may as well.

39:53.466 --> 39:56.294
I might be able to put
the trailer right there.

39:56.414 --> 39:57.655
It's actually pretty convenient.

39:57.775 --> 39:59.885
You know, you can even
ride to Heartland from here.

40:00.005 --> 40:02.188
Kinda sounds like you want me nearby.

40:02.308 --> 40:05.741
Or I just don't want you couch surfing
your way back to my dude ranch.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.264
Right.

40:07.384 --> 40:11.497
I do owe you a thank you though.
For getting rid of that food truck.

40:11.617 --> 40:13.604
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:13.724 --> 40:16.173
Really? Potable water?

40:16.293 --> 40:19.824
You're trying to tell me you
have nothing to do with that?

40:20.849 --> 40:24.042
- Oh. Sorry. I gotta get going.
- Hot date?

40:24.999 --> 40:29.960
- If it was? Would that bother you?
- Are you kidding me? Please...

40:38.539 --> 40:41.397
- You okay?
- I guess so...

40:41.517 --> 40:43.514
Remember just breath.

40:43.634 --> 40:47.555
You're a great trick rider, Olivia.
It's just you and these two guys.

40:47.675 --> 40:51.406
So take it slow, and
try to enjoy it, okay?

40:51.526 --> 40:53.557
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:59.476 --> 41:01.446
It's okay.

41:02.050 --> 41:03.752
That's good.

41:03.872 --> 41:06.266
Now pick a spot in the
distance and focus on it.

41:06.386 --> 41:09.758
That'll help you keep your balance.

41:09.878 --> 41:12.306
There you go.

41:17.792 --> 41:20.335
That looks amazing!

41:26.371 --> 41:28.343
Steady.

41:28.463 --> 41:31.828
That's the Olivia I remember!

41:34.985 --> 41:38.959
That's it right there!
That looks awesome!

41:42.076 --> 41:45.257
- You've got this!
- Whoa.

41:47.929 --> 41:50.297
That looks amazing!

41:51.385 --> 41:53.633
- Oh my gosh.
- Nice job.

41:53.753 --> 41:55.718
Thank you.

41:59.266 --> 42:02.869
Looks like you're starting
to get the hang of it.

42:02.989 --> 42:07.537
Um, for what it's worth...
I'm sorry. About Adam.

42:07.657 --> 42:11.026
- If I'd known...
- You probably would've done it anyways.

42:11.838 --> 42:14.159
Yeah, probably.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.675
No big deal. I'm already over it.

42:38.762 --> 42:40.346
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:40.466 --> 42:42.515
Ah, I just I...

42:42.635 --> 42:45.317
I just got off the phone with Texas.

42:45.437 --> 42:49.822
- So, it's official?
- Well, actually, I called them...

42:50.141 --> 42:52.676
I turned down the offer.

42:52.796 --> 42:55.950
- Why?
- Well, according to Jade,

42:56.070 --> 42:59.098
I'm making an impact with the
students at my rodeo school

42:59.218 --> 43:01.736
so who needs Texas.

43:02.823 --> 43:05.191
Must have been really nice to hear.

43:06.758 --> 43:11.709
Girls, the truth is I want to
be here with the two of you.

43:11.829 --> 43:14.420
And with the grandkids.

43:14.540 --> 43:18.133
And hopefully, maybe there
will be more grandkids some day.

43:18.253 --> 43:21.051
And no job is worth missing out on that.

43:21.171 --> 43:25.006
- Dad, I'm so glad you're staying.
- Me too.

didn't mean anything?

Wow, for such a smart guy,
you can sure be dumb sometimes.

Isn't love...

43:43.124 --> 43:43.891
I should go.

Don't go.
