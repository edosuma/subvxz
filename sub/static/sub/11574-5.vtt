WEBVTT

00:08.676 --> 00:10.257
What?

00:10.344 --> 00:13.006
Goosebump alert! How did you know
we were going to ask you something?

00:13.097 --> 00:14.553
Yeah, we didn't say a word.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.892
Yeah. You two never shut up.
So, either you're scheming,

00:16.976 --> 00:21.185
or it's my lucky day. Thing is,
I'm not that lucky. So... what!?

00:21.272 --> 00:23.137
--We have a case.
--Yes.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.938
Missing husband.

00:25.026 --> 00:31.568
First, we thought he ducked out on
his wife. And then, we found this.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.945
Yes, we need you to put your sniffer
into hyper drive and help us with an ID.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.152
Please. lt's blood, right?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.658
What am |, a German Shepherd?

00:39.749 --> 00:43.412
Oh my god. Guys, this just in--

00:43.502 --> 00:48.838
You're a policeman who's
also his own police dog!

00:48.925 --> 00:50.381
How did I not see this before?

00:50.468 --> 00:52.004
--Seriously, dude, this is--
--Goodbye!

00:52.094 --> 00:54.130
[BO] Come on! Dyson, help us.

00:54.222 --> 00:57.635
Please? Please, please,
please. Please! Please!

00:57.725 --> 00:59.090
Yes, it's blood.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.598
Well, I know it's blood.
But is it his or hers?

01:02.688 --> 01:06.397
lt's cow blood, ladies. Enjoy.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.770
[KENZI] O.M.G. Case closed.

01:08.861 --> 01:12.774
He ran off with the butcher's wife. He
totally ran off with the butcher's wife.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.948
Oh, come on! Dyson,
you're not mad, are you?

01:33.469 --> 01:36.552
Hey, we're friends, babe!

01:36.639 --> 01:41.008
Are you kidding me?
Dyson, what the hell?

01:42.979 --> 01:44.560
It's a pack thing, babe.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.478
Oh my god.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.726
Good to see you, man.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.815
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.818
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.821
My love carries a death sentence.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.994
l was lost for years,

02:02.081 --> 02:04.743
searching, while hiding,

02:04.834 --> 02:08.998
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:09.088 --> 02:13.957
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:19.849 --> 02:23.888
And the bear says, "You really
didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"

02:26.188 --> 02:28.270
--Pleasure to meet you. Cayden.
--Nice to meet you, Cayden.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.689
Pour it up. This round's on him.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.946
Okay, check it. His name is Cayden.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.275
Uh huh?

02:40.369 --> 02:41.745
And that's pretty much all I got.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.037
Three walk-bys and all we got is
a name? Way to go, Mata Hari.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.581
--Come on!
--[CAYDEN] Aw, you wanna do it?

02:47.668 --> 02:50.375
Huh, huh? Be the ref. Be the ref.

02:50.463 --> 02:52.579
--Are you guys ready?
--This is mine.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.788
Come on. Come on.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.293
Come on!

02:58.012 --> 03:02.346
Oh, you lost your lot. You lost!

03:06.187 --> 03:10.681
Really? So, that is
normal male behaviour?

03:10.775 --> 03:14.734
Oh, yeah. Celebrating a bestie's
physical triumph is like

03:14.820 --> 03:18.278
a girly squeal over a seventy
percent off sale at a shoe store.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.903
Or in your case, the
anything-you-can-unsheathe store.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.700
Yeah, it's like saying,
"Way to go B.F.F. You done good."

03:23.788 --> 03:26.780
Yeah, but if that's his B.F.F., how come
we've never heard of him before?

03:26.874 --> 03:33.461
It is a riddle, cloaked in a mystery,
wrapped in layers of hot, hot manliness.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.011
And that would mean...?

03:43.099 --> 03:47.968
Uhh, it's either something vaguely
bi-curious, or they're just hungry.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.895
Either way, I'm just glad they're
not sniffing each other's butts.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.232
And on that note...

03:52.316 --> 03:56.650
No, Trick, wait. Who's Dyson's mysterious
friend that we've never heard of?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.524
Yeah, dude, what's the deal
with Benicio Del Lobo?

03:59.615 --> 04:02.448
Dyson and Cayden once ran
with a pack of shifters.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.071
So, they go way back?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.538
What are we talking, like, ten, fifteen?

04:06.622 --> 04:08.783
Like, a few hundred years.

04:08.874 --> 04:12.332
Oh, so I guess they're not reminiscing
about the big game in high school.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.911
They were a little busy crushing
the enemy of their king

04:15.005 --> 04:18.589
into bloody sacks of meat.

04:18.676 --> 04:23.010
So actually, that's exactly what
they could be talking about.

04:37.111 --> 04:40.319
For a hundred years, they
belonged to a pack of wolves.

04:40.406 --> 04:45.821
Mercenary warriors from all over,
bound to the Fae King of Ailech.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.499
They were called the Laighnach
Faelad. They were feared.

05:08.517 --> 05:13.136
You're saying Dyson was a pack-matey,
liege-serving, warrior dude?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.437
Until he severed his
allegiance to the King.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.186
After that, he left the
pack and Ailech forever.

05:18.277 --> 05:22.236
So, not really the same
lone wolf we know today?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.655
So, what happened?

05:24.742 --> 05:29.111
What happens in the pack
stays in the pack. I can feel it.

05:29.205 --> 05:33.790
The thing about wolves is they typically
serve their king until his death.

05:33.876 --> 05:37.585
So, either Cayden
severed his ties, too, or...

05:37.671 --> 05:41.539
The King, he's been dead
a few months now.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.751
Good. Were you with him 'til the end?

05:44.845 --> 05:48.053
Yeah. The things we saw.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.381
Ran with the Fenians back in the 1860s

05:50.476 --> 05:54.594
and made a killing selling
surplus weapons from World War |.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.599
Yeah. What was his
most recent business?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.932
War. Always war.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.269
Started a little company back
in the '90s called Majesty.

06:03.364 --> 06:07.073
The mercenaries?
What are they worth, what?

06:07.159 --> 06:10.196
Billions. Me and the
boys made some cash.

06:10.287 --> 06:16.874
Spent most of it on booze and
women. The rest we wasted.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.952
You were missed, though.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.754
--How are the lads?
--Ah, they're good.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.333
Some stayed on at Majesty.
Others went looking for a new liege.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.171
And they'd laugh their arses off to
hear you speakin' all North American.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.757
But I can still talk the talk.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.263
Oh yeah, let's hear it.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.890
On domhan.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.940
--Ona réaltai', den Ghealach!
--Ona réaltai', den Ghealach!

06:41.026 --> 06:44.063
[CAYDEN] Yes! Yes!

06:44.154 --> 06:47.772
And you? What, are you
looking for a new king now?

06:47.866 --> 06:52.155
Naw. Freelance. You can
make a good chunk of change

06:52.246 --> 06:55.113
pulling mercenary jobs for
international security companies.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.995
Uh huh. And Ciara?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.461
[CAYDEN] Ciara?

07:05.634 --> 07:09.593
This is gonna hurt a bit, but
you're man enough to take it.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.841
[CAYDEN] She's dead, mate.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.095
VVhen?

07:16.186 --> 07:19.724
After the King croaked, she...

07:19.815 --> 07:24.309
...went on a little road
trip with a grenade.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.894
There wasn't much left to bury.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.527
No, man. That's not Ciara.
She wouldn't have done that.

07:30.618 --> 07:35.829
Well, you're a little
biased, aren't you, friend?

07:47.217 --> 07:51.460
P Down in the valley
was a sweet little lassie P

07:51.555 --> 07:56.845
P whose eyes shone all glassy
as she walked so sassyP

07:56.935 --> 07:58.391
Dyson .

08:01.190 --> 08:05.103
This is deep. You should
have come to me immediately.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.731
There were others hurt worse than I.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.156
Get a hayloft!

08:13.911 --> 08:17.199
Best be careful there, Dyson.

08:17.289 --> 08:21.248
She's the wife of my best mate.

08:21.335 --> 08:26.500
I watched Stefan grow up.
Become a warrior. Fall in love.

08:28.467 --> 08:33.928
We fought side by side, Cayden.
He's like a brother to me.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.049
What is it?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.880
The King requests an audience.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.511
What, now?

08:48.821 --> 08:50.937
[cell phone]

08:51.031 --> 08:55.445
Hello. What? Slow down. I can't--

08:55.536 --> 08:57.572
--Who is it?
--Lauren.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.205
O-Okay. Stay where
you are. Don't move.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.205
She's at the clubhouse. She's
in trouble. Come on, we're up.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.877
Thanks, Trickster.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.248
So, starting tomorrow,
unless we're working,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.675
all humans are to be locked
in their living quarters.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.377
Compliments of the new Ash.

09:15.472 --> 09:19.056
Well, I mean, here you are,
running amok.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.721
I mean... what an Ash-hole.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.478
I kinda panicked when I found out.
ljust ran, while I still could.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.309
I didn't know where
else to go. I'm sorry.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.487
Don't be. We'll fix this.
He can't treat you this way.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.532
Yeah, he can. The old Ash
was more lenient than most.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.529
The rules were bent.
But this new one, he just--

09:38.620 --> 09:40.611
He's not so bendy. Right.

09:40.706 --> 09:44.619
Bo, please tell me you're
just blowing off steam.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.792
Well, first, I'm going to go give
the Ash a piece of my mind.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.040
And then, possibly a piece of my fist.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.873
You can't. Lachlan has
no idea that I'm here.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.333
I don't know what he'll do to
either one of us if he finds out.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.795
I don't care. You stay here
as long as you need.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.973
I'd be putting you in too
much danger. Both of you.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.847
Besides, Bo, I don't want
to complicate things.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.271
Oh. Yeah.

10:08.358 --> 10:15.025
But, no. You think of
this as a safe haven.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.027
Gee, I wonder what could
possibly go wrong.

10:20.454 --> 10:26.871
P ...the lass and she
sang for the last... P

10:26.960 --> 10:29.246
Come on!

10:29.338 --> 10:34.378
Only two things make a man
travel this far--women and money.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.799
So, which is it?

10:35.886 --> 10:39.799
If only l were chasing tail, my friend.

10:39.890 --> 10:44.475
I'm lookin' for a weapon
stolen two weeks ago

10:44.561 --> 10:47.143
from an armament
contractor for Light Fae.

10:47.231 --> 10:50.348
[DYSON] What kind of weapon?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.023
The kind that goes boom.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.819
--Ahh.
--|'m talkin' a W.M.D.

10:55.906 --> 10:59.694
that makes military-grade
warheads look like laser tag.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.992
And I need your help finding it.

11:02.079 --> 11:05.913
--Why me?
--'Cause it's in your backyard.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.457
Came in on a ship, day before last.

11:09.545 --> 11:13.163
The docks. That's Dark Fae territory.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.589
There's a lot of places down
there that I can't enter.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.962
So, you can't help me then?

11:18.053 --> 11:20.886
I can't.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.009
But I know someone.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.636
[knocking]

11:24.726 --> 11:28.059
[singing]

11:30.065 --> 11:35.059
If you're lookin' for a booty call,
you're banging down the wrong door.

11:35.153 --> 11:39.146
Aw, that's too bad, darlin'. Hate to
see a good banging go to waste.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.732
You need to put a leash on that one.

11:41.827 --> 11:47.163
Actually, what I need is a solid.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.662
Sorry, we're interrupting
something, obviously.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.334
Maybe it's me who's in the way.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.343
So, how do you all know each other?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.886
Sorry, love.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.720
A Mongolian Death Worm?

12:10.814 --> 12:13.601
Extremely rare. Extremely dangerous.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.774
I'm guessing its powers
aren't moving real slow

12:15.861 --> 12:18.443
and then baking on the
sidewalk in the sun?

12:18.530 --> 12:21.738
I've read about these in a text
on matter transmutation.

12:21.825 --> 12:26.114
I believe it produces an electrical force
that liquefies just about anything.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.911
A brutal regime in North Africa
has already been trying to get at it.

12:28.999 --> 12:32.457
Oh, that's great. The worst of the
Fae criminals are gonna be after it, too.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.877
If it's still in the city. It's probably
gone all black market by now.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.296
Wait, there's a Fae black market?

12:38.383 --> 12:42.171
Somebody has got to
get me a Cherry Coke!

12:42.262 --> 12:45.004
What? They're, like, really hard to find.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.465
If it is still in the city, there's a
good chance it's at an arms dealer

12:48.560 --> 12:50.300
that we've been watching
down on the docks.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.851
That's Dark Fae territory.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.726
Yes, it is. However--

12:54.816 --> 12:57.398
Oh, of course. Send in the succubus.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.692
What, so wait, I'm just supposed to

12:58.779 --> 13:01.862
waltz right into an arms
dealer joint and say...

13:01.949 --> 13:03.359
How much for this cute little fellow?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.532
Don't!

13:05.619 --> 13:06.904
It's a Keukegen!

13:06.995 --> 13:10.613
Right. A Keukegen. Don't
want to unleash that action.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.665
Without a gas mask, it would be deadly.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.586
Of course, if your knowledge of
Fae weaponry was comprehensive,

13:17.673 --> 13:20.164
you'd know that, wouldn't ya?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.293
--Busted.
--Explain yourself.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.341
You've got twenty seconds.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.670
| work independently.
Neither Dark, nor Light.

13:26.765 --> 13:31.885
Things are sticky in the middle.
So, I thought I should arm up a little.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.016
You're not that rogue succubus
I've heard so much about, are you?

13:35.107 --> 13:40.352
--Double busted.
--What exactly are you looking for?

13:40.445 --> 13:44.654
A new toy has been rumoured to
have hit the shores a few days ago.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.575
A certain Mongolian weapon
of the worm variety.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.870
Yes. Well...

13:51.957 --> 13:55.916
...that would be a specialty item.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.834
Specialty item, huh?

13:57.921 --> 13:59.422
Uh huh.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.043
We shouldn't have sent
her in there alone.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.547
Come on. Chill out, man.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.471
Bo is tough. She can handle herself,
but I don't know this guy.

14:09.558 --> 14:12.721
Well, maybe we should
just dry gulch the guy, huh?

14:12.811 --> 14:18.306
Like that time we set up the ambush
on the road to Donegal. Come on.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.766
She could get hurt.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.351
Or worse.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.027
You're gonna get yourself killed.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.570
The King has a battle plan,

14:25.657 --> 14:28.399
which would secure the Northern
and Western territories.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.108
I'm delivering it at his behest.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.785
Aye, across enemy lines.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.615
I cannot let you go alone.
I'm coming with ya.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.449
No. The command is clear.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.035
Why?! Why you? Why alone?!

14:40.130 --> 14:43.873
It is the edict of our King.
We live and die by his inclinations.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.377
Or his stupidity.

14:45.469 --> 14:50.463
Dyson, I know you think I'm headstrong.
And you've always been there for me.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.299
But this is about something
greater than us.

14:53.393 --> 14:58.729
Lest you forget. Dying for
the King is a great honour.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.604
I cannot let you go!

15:03.695 --> 15:08.155
l've accepted my fate, friend.
Nothing can change that.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.032
One thing might.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.480
Who are you to approach the Norn?

15:45.570 --> 15:51.065
lam no one. But I come
to ask you to intervene.

15:51.159 --> 15:55.949
Save the life of a good man in
mortal danger. Stefan O'Breen.

15:56.039 --> 16:01.750
A life? That is the most difficult
thing that can be granted.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.043
Yet it can be done.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.543
Yes. But there is a price.

16:06.633 --> 16:11.548
--Name it.
--The price is your wolf.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.129
My wolf? It's all that I am.

16:14.224 --> 16:19.435
Then will you give all that you are
to save the life of your friend?

16:46.047 --> 16:49.881
Very few people know about the
Mongolian Death Worm, so how do you?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.459
You don't really need to know that,
do you, Mr. Cumberbatch?

16:52.554 --> 16:54.920
Well, one can never be too certain.

16:58.435 --> 17:02.178
Sweetheart, just stay there. I
happen to be a happily married man.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.693
This is your idea of hospitality?
You suck at it.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.990
What, you didn't think l was
gonna have a security system?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.692
To be honest, this really
isn't all that impressive.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.164
I mean, what happens now?
| get crushed by plushies?

17:20.248 --> 17:22.330
Oh, Fae power plushies are so 2007.

17:22.417 --> 17:26.786
Plus, I've got this new toy I've been
dying to play with. It's so much fun.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.212
And it's only gonna
hurt you for a minute.

17:32.135 --> 17:35.093
Oh, look, I got an ouchie.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.769
Why don't we just go in and get her?

17:44.856 --> 17:47.643
It's a Dark Fae place of business.
There's rules here, Cayden.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.942
Rules, rules. Rules are for suckers.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.035
What the hell is in that dart?

18:01.122 --> 18:04.489
I'm not quite sure. I got this
surprise bag of weapons I bought

18:04.584 --> 18:06.245
and you never know what you're
gonna get with one of those.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.419
But tell me, on a scale of one
to excruciating, how's the pain?

18:09.506 --> 18:10.495
I can handle it.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.833
You know what? I really do think that this
little play date has come to an end.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.260
I wonder what I can get
for a dead succubus.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.929
Well, that's something
you're never gonna find out.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.110
--Hey, him.
--No! Look, I'll make you a deal!

18:34.197 --> 18:36.438
You find the Death Worm and I'll
give you double what anybody else

18:36.533 --> 18:38.649
is looking to pay you. Double!

18:38.743 --> 18:41.450
You tried to dart gun my brain
and then you want to cut a deal?

18:41.538 --> 18:44.826
Business is business.

18:44.916 --> 18:49.535
Cayden, be a dear and knock the
business out of this jackhole.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.085
With pleasure.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.137
--[CAYDEN] You okay?
--That jerk-off killed my hand.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.609
--[DYSON] You're hurt?
--You're perceptive.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.819
Did you get anything
on the Death Worm?

19:23.913 --> 19:26.746
The guy knows something but
wouldn't talk. | swiped this though.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.619
Why don't you make yourself
useful and find something on it.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.917
--You need to heal first.
--|'m good!

19:31.004 --> 19:32.460
[DYSON] The hell you are.

19:32.547 --> 19:36.836
I mean I don't need your help. You're
not the only wolf in town, you know.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.507
Shot gun.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.328
You're not stoppin', are ya?

20:11.419 --> 20:14.161
I don't usually go all the way.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.120
I might hurt you.

20:16.216 --> 20:21.176
I'm a big, bad wolf.
You can round all my bases.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.494
Amazing.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.417
They haven't cooled yet.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.625
Oh.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.303
You're not mad, are you?

21:07.058 --> 21:10.971
It's alright, Bo. You had to heal.
lt's who you are.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.017
--Mmm.
--They haven't--

21:19.112 --> 21:21.068
Mm mm.

21:21.156 --> 21:25.991
Mmm! Doc, you make these?
Tastier than my mom's.

21:26.077 --> 21:30.787
It's the C02 bubbles. It gives
the dough its light, airy texture.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.785
You add just the right
amount of baking powder

21:32.876 --> 21:36.118
and then ensure the fat content
to retain the gas bubbles

21:36.212 --> 21:40.046
and then throw in the eggs,
as a binding element.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.876
Wow. She just totally took
the fun outta yummy.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.552
Miss the lab much?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.472
Maybe it was too rash,
running away like that.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.301
I mean, if! return now and apologize,

21:52.395 --> 21:54.306
maybe the Ash's
punishment will be lenient.

21:54.397 --> 21:58.766
No, I've met the guy. Lenient would
be an ankle bracelet of razors.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.896
Besides, if you go back now with
your tail between your legs,

22:00.987 --> 22:06.198
Lachlan will have more power over
you than ever before. You're safe here.

22:08.786 --> 22:13.325
Yes, bitches! Ugh, my genius hacker
bud in Vienna totally came through.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.748
--We're in.
--Ooh, ooh!

22:15.835 --> 22:17.291
Yes.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.499
According to this email sent yesterday,

22:20.590 --> 22:22.296
the Death Worm is going to
be auctioned off tonight.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.841
That is a very elite group of invitees.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.635
It's gonna be hard for us to blend in.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.337
--Not necessarily.
--Yeah.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.889
Bo and I could totally pull off

22:31.976 --> 22:35.389
the infamous Romanian
Cantacuzino sisters.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.766
I'm not going to let you
go in there alone this time.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.939
That almost sounded like an order.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.984
What he means is we can't
just sit here and do nothin'.

22:43.071 --> 22:46.814
Oh! Last minute save by Cayden
and the crowd goes wild!

22:46.908 --> 22:48.068
Wild, wild...

22:48.159 --> 22:49.660
You guys will do something.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.077
Dangerous hotties such as ourselves
are obviously going to need muscle.

22:53.164 --> 22:56.952
And man-candy.
Lots and lots of man-candy.

23:00.713 --> 23:05.457
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this fine event.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.919
If you would please gather 'round,
the auction is about to begin.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.255
Cayden's in position.
He's got the back covered.

23:12.350 --> 23:16.138
How many of those have you had?

23:16.229 --> 23:17.594
Lots.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.021
And now without further ado,
please allow me to introduce to you

23:20.108 --> 23:25.694
one of the world's rarest
and most dangerous weapons.

23:25.780 --> 23:32.492
Thank you... the formidable
Mongolian Death Worm!

23:36.958 --> 23:40.667
Everyone... meet Velma.

23:42.213 --> 23:46.832
So, that's the feared
Mongolian Death Worm?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.882
What is she gonna do,
gum us to death?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.926
Anybody got a light?

23:56.561 --> 24:00.600
Velma is a 3,000-year-old
Mongolian Death Worm,

24:00.690 --> 24:04.774
whose destructive powers can
outmatch any human-made missile.

24:04.861 --> 24:09.070
When you think about it,
it's actually brilliant packaging.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.990
I mean, who's going to
suspect a little old lady?

24:12.076 --> 24:14.488
Yeah, you've never battled
one at a fifty percent off sale.

24:14.579 --> 24:17.537
[BRlKlM] She's well-known for her
part in the Greco-Persian wars.

24:17.624 --> 24:22.118
She's also the inspiration
behind the Archimedes Death Ray.

24:22.211 --> 24:26.545
Though once difficult to control, Velma's
mind has weakened over the years,

24:26.633 --> 24:30.000
making her now an extremely
user-friendly weapon.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.551
Come on! Give it a spin! Come on!

24:32.639 --> 24:35.722
Alright, outbursts like this are
merely a touch of dementia

24:35.808 --> 24:38.265
and will not affect the
efficiency of the product.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.595
Now if I could please
draw your attention

24:41.689 --> 24:45.147
to Velma's portable television set.
It is her most treasured possession.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.646
It's also her activation key.

24:47.737 --> 24:52.026
If you take it from her,
you will incite rage.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.981
--Hey!
--Now, it's important to note

24:54.077 --> 24:58.662
that whoever holds the
activation key controls Velma.

24:58.748 --> 25:03.037
Furthermore, the holder of the television
will never be targeted by Velma.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.537
Give me back my T.V.!

25:04.629 --> 25:07.792
[BRlKlM] Now Velma, I will give this
television back to you if you be good

25:07.882 --> 25:10.464
and obliterate that big, bad truck.

25:17.517 --> 25:21.055
[crowd] Ahhh!

25:22.980 --> 25:25.722
Yeah!

25:25.817 --> 25:31.483
Now deactivating Velma is simple.
You just give her back her television.

25:31.572 --> 25:36.612
Never, ever misplace the television.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.241
I don't know whether to be
impressed or terrified.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.912
I'm goin' with terrified.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.833
Alright, now without further ado,
let the bidding begin.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.581
We're gonna start the bidding
at twenty million dollars.

25:47.672 --> 25:48.878
Right now, twenty million.
Twenty million.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.876
Do I hear twenty, twenty
million? Twenty-five. Twenty-five.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.549
Do I hear twenty-five? Twenty-five
right there. Thirty. Do l have thirty?

25:53.636 --> 25:55.467
Thirty million doll--where?
Right there, thirty.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.921
Forty? Forty million dollars. Forty.
Do I hear fifty? Fifty right there.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.846
Si--Seventy-five, seventy-five.
Seventy-five million.

25:59.934 --> 26:02.141
We have seventy-five million. Ninety?
Ninety million dollars right there.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.468
Who's got a hundred?
Where's a hundred?

26:03.563 --> 26:05.895
A hundred million dollars right there,
ma'am, yes, that's you right there.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.439
One hundred million dollars. One
twenty. Who's one twenty? One twenty.

26:08.526 --> 26:11.689
We have a hundred and twenty million
dollars on the table. Going once.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.110
One hundred and twenty, going twice.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.483
One hundred and fifty million dollars!

26:15.575 --> 26:16.690
One hundred and fifty million dollars.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.491
--Little mama, if you mess this up for us,
--One fifty right here. Going once.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.570
there's a good chance you're
gonna leave here in a bucket.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.904
I'm sorry. Auction fever.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.035
Little lady in front, one hundred
and fifty million dollars.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.662
One hundred and fifty-five.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.712
One hundred and fifty-five million
dollars right here, going once.

26:30.798 --> 26:35.542
Going twice. Sold! One hundred
and fifty-five million dollars.

26:35.636 --> 26:40.255
Put your hands together.
Congratulations, ma'am, well done.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.386
--Good job.
--Yeah, right.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.094
So, now all we have to do is
not pay for the Death Worm,

26:46.189 --> 26:50.273
kidnap killer grandma, and get the hell
outta here without getting liquefied.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.815
No biggie.

26:57.742 --> 26:58.948
--Hi, I'm--
--No names.

26:59.035 --> 27:02.118
You give me the money,
you get Velma. Simple.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.491
Hush up, children.
I'm watching my stories.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.699
I take cash, gold, jewels,
or bank transfer.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.410
How about none of the above?

27:10.505 --> 27:13.542
In the name of the Ash,
we confiscate this weapon.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.466
Ha, I don't think so. Boys.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.303
Hey!

27:29.398 --> 27:31.434
Let's go. Move.

27:36.113 --> 27:40.231
Hello, Brikim. Old buddy, old pal.

27:40.326 --> 27:44.285
Cayden, damn!

27:44.372 --> 27:45.953
Alright, look, I can explain this.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.326
--[DYSON] What's going on here?
--You two know each other?

27:48.417 --> 27:53.457
Oh, we go way back, don't we?
We stole the weapon together.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.163
Then we transported
the weapon together,

27:55.258 --> 27:58.421
and we were going to sell
the weapon together.

27:58.511 --> 28:02.424
Only you reneged on that
last part, didn't ya, partner?

28:02.515 --> 28:03.971
Cayden, you lying bastard.

28:04.058 --> 28:08.222
Now, listen. Hey! You need
to forget about this, okay?

28:08.312 --> 28:10.974
We're going to go back
to our fifty-fifty split.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.390
Sixty-fou rty.

28:14.485 --> 28:19.149
Nah. I think I'll finish this gig solo.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.784
[whistle]

28:27.456 --> 28:31.415
Thanks, buddy. I couldn't
have done it without you.

28:34.755 --> 28:38.339
Now, you really don't want
to mess with this, do ya?

28:38.426 --> 28:39.666
Give me back my T.V.!

28:39.760 --> 28:43.344
Velma. Let's go.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.775
Watch out.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.904
Guys! What happened?
Where's laser-granny?

29:05.995 --> 29:07.201
Yeah, and where's Cayden?

29:07.288 --> 29:08.903
--He's gone.
--Cayden took Velma.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.785
It turns out he was nothing
but a wolf in wolf's clothing.

29:16.505 --> 29:19.087
How did we not see this coming?

29:19.175 --> 29:21.917
Because big whoopsies
are twenty-twenty in hindsight.

29:22.011 --> 29:25.094
So, Cayden and that Brikim dude
stole the Death Worm to begin with?

29:25.181 --> 29:26.796
Well, they were obviously
in on it together,

29:26.891 --> 29:29.883
until Brikim snatched
the weapon for himself.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.184
He almost pulled it off with
that quickie auction of his.

29:32.271 --> 29:37.061
I'm sorry I got you guys
involved in this. I trusted him.

29:37.151 --> 29:39.563
I didn't think he'd betray me.

29:41.322 --> 29:46.942
D, yo! D! Sorry, man, but this isn't
time to hit the snooze button.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.947
We gots us a formidable fogy to find.

29:49.038 --> 29:51.404
Dyson, do you have any idea
where he may have taken Velma?

29:51.499 --> 29:52.488
No.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.915
Maybe he sold her to
Miss Moneybags. Huh?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.742
She was pretty loose
with the old checkbook.

29:56.837 --> 30:00.796
Or Cayden cut a deal
with Cumberbatch.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.044
I don't think so. He lost
interest in the auction early on.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.716
Exactly!

30:06.639 --> 30:10.302
Velma! Puddin'.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.930
This is butterscotch. I wanted vanilla!

30:13.020 --> 30:15.602
Butterscotch, vanilla,
what's the difference?

30:17.483 --> 30:20.316
Genius plan, stealing Velma
from the interlopers.

30:20.403 --> 30:23.315
Mind you, I didn't know there
was going to be bloodshed.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.237
Every battle has its casualties.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.860
Yes. Of course.

30:26.951 --> 30:30.318
I don't like butterscotch. I like vanilla.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.870
Velma!

30:32.957 --> 30:36.290
Looks like we have a deal.

30:36.377 --> 30:38.789
And don't worry about the old girl,
I'll take good care of her.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.916
About that, I couldn't care less.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.675
Hey! Wait!

30:53.060 --> 30:55.927
You're Light Fae, you don't
belong here. There are rules!

30:58.357 --> 31:00.188
Rules are for suckers.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.198
Where is that damn T.V. set,
Hale? Do you see it?

31:13.289 --> 31:15.280
What am |, the T.V. whisperer?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.792
Dark Fae ain't the only one with skills.

31:20.880 --> 31:25.840
[whistling]

31:27.511 --> 31:30.298
I said I wanted vanilla!

31:32.016 --> 31:34.428
No. No, now, now, Velma.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.225
No, please. No! Velma, No!

31:37.313 --> 31:38.644
No, dude, don't come this way!

31:38.731 --> 31:41.313
Bo! The T.V.'s right there!

31:41.400 --> 31:46.485
Okay! Okay, Velma.
Just stay calm, okay?

31:46.572 --> 31:49.154
Okay, just...

31:49.241 --> 31:52.199
Here we go. There you go.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.170
Cayden's gone.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.098
He's bleeding.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.141
[HALE] Whoo.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.311
--[BO] You okay?
--Ah, you know.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.888
Boys may have retreated...

32:22.983 --> 32:24.519
...permanently.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.522
Other than that, I'm fine.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.069
Velma!

32:43.796 --> 32:45.377
[DYSON] Stefan!

32:47.925 --> 32:49.506
Stefan!

32:58.602 --> 33:01.890
Stefan!

33:01.981 --> 33:09.274
A-Ambush. Too many.
Tell the King I tried.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.274
No, mate. You're gonna
tell him yourself.

33:11.365 --> 33:13.731
Take care of Ciara.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.406
No!

33:51.155 --> 33:54.318
He will receive a burial
befitting his bravery.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.148
Where is Ciara?

33:58.037 --> 34:01.325
The King came for her.

34:01.415 --> 34:02.871
She'll be made his queen in the morn.

34:02.958 --> 34:07.668
The King sent Stefan to his death
so he could claim Ciara for his own?

34:07.755 --> 34:09.211
Aye.

34:13.761 --> 34:14.671
Where you going?

34:14.762 --> 34:17.469
To shed the King's blood,
as he shed Stefan's.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.307
You would fight me on this?!

34:22.394 --> 34:29.357
You know we would. We serve
the King and no one else.

34:29.443 --> 34:34.608
I will no fight my brothers.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.075
But I can serve this King no more!

34:56.720 --> 34:59.302
You should really get that looked at.

34:59.390 --> 35:04.851
Yeah. You got me good there, buddy.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.019
Can you heal him, Bo?

35:07.106 --> 35:11.896
I can only breathe sexual chi
into someone. This is beyond me.

35:11.986 --> 35:14.227
It's too late, man.

35:14.321 --> 35:17.358
I'm gonna get you a doctor.

35:17.449 --> 35:23.160
I'm not Stefan. Savin' me
won't bring him back.

35:23.247 --> 35:26.739
I shouldn't have used my wolf on you.

35:26.834 --> 35:32.921
Hey, all's fair in war and war.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.167
Isn't that right?

35:34.258 --> 35:36.920
Getting all honourable on me now?

35:37.011 --> 35:40.924
Honour's for the weak.

35:41.015 --> 35:48.433
You were right all those years ago,
strike out on your own.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.638
No, mate.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.600
We're wolves.
We're meant to travel in packs.

35:53.694 --> 35:58.063
Nah, the solitary life worked for you.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.944
It just took me a while
to find a new pack.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.997
We almost got away.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.999
"We"? Who you talkin' about?

36:15.090 --> 36:20.301
She would have loved me. Eventually.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.845
Dyson. You're gonna want to see this.

36:30.606 --> 36:35.475
Ciara? God, Ciara! It's okay. It's okay.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.730
Dyson!

36:37.821 --> 36:39.197
Bo, your knife.

36:39.281 --> 36:43.365
All these centuries, I never
thought I'd see you again.

36:43.452 --> 36:46.910
Cayden told me that you'd killed
yourself after the King died.

36:52.086 --> 36:56.955
At some point, he decided he loved me.
And more, that I should love him back.

36:57.049 --> 37:00.587
--Did he hurt you?
--No. No, I'm fine.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.053
You saved me.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.799
I think, technically, I saved you.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.552
I mean I found you. I mean I'm Bo.

37:07.643 --> 37:13.138
Yes. Bo, this is... this is Ciara.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.107
It's a pleasure, Bo. And thank you.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.686
Yeah. So, you and Dyson go way back?

37:20.781 --> 37:22.817
I trained his pack in the art of war.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.490
--Are you a shifter?
--No.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.908
Do you mind?

37:26.995 --> 37:28.531
[BO] Oh, no.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.739
No, my father was Fairy
and my mother was Scathach.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.075
She passed her warrior
training skills on to me.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.912
Oh. I'm a succubus.

37:40.801 --> 37:43.884
He's gone.

37:43.971 --> 37:49.637
Let him go then. He's a changed man.
Life of war made him hard.

37:49.726 --> 37:55.596
If nothing else, he brought us
into each other's lives again.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.477
Yes. He did do that.

38:07.953 --> 38:12.617
Velma, please. No.

38:12.708 --> 38:16.166
As l was saying, Velma is a sweet old
Death Worm who just needs a home.

38:16.253 --> 38:19.416
And you had your doubts about
our little consulting arrangement.

38:19.506 --> 38:24.671
Now look at us. You and
me, consulting together.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.173
Over there.

38:27.264 --> 38:29.550
And be careful.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.552
I didn't do this because
of any arrangement.

38:31.643 --> 38:37.183
Well, send me the invoice anyway.
As for the Worm, I'll take care of it.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.730
Her.

38:45.407 --> 38:46.362
Pardon?

38:46.450 --> 38:50.864
She's not a thing. She's a...

38:50.954 --> 38:54.993
Well, she's alive, anyway. And
she deserves kindness and respect,

38:55.083 --> 38:56.209
like all living things.

38:56.293 --> 38:59.376
Hah! You fell. You're wet!

39:01.632 --> 39:06.592
What an interesting idea.
Be kind to the things.

39:06.678 --> 39:11.638
And if I do extend kindness and
respect, what do | get back in return?

39:11.725 --> 39:16.640
You will make her friends very happy.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.312
And are you her friend?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.651
Yes.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.818
| see. Well, if it's going to
make you very happy, Bo,

39:24.905 --> 39:31.026
then I will do my best to
take good care of her.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.610
I think the words you're
looking for are, "Thank you."

39:33.705 --> 39:37.823
Yeah. Thanks.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.997
Hate commercials!

39:44.049 --> 39:47.917
By the way, how is Lauren?

39:48.011 --> 39:51.253
I don't know. I haven't
spoken to her in days.

39:51.348 --> 39:54.090
Of course you haven't.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.846
Come along, my dear.
Let's get you settled.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.725
Leave the pen.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.358
Bye, dear.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.994
I'm not taking your bed.
The floor's fine for me.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.197
I'm not letting you sleep on the floor.

40:18.292 --> 40:21.625
For heaven's sake, Dyson,
we used to sleep on dirt.

40:21.712 --> 40:24.704
Only out of necessity.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.881
Come on.

40:27.968 --> 40:32.837
Let me take care of you the way
you used to take care of us.

40:35.309 --> 40:38.096
All those years ago.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.768
So much has changed.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.942
Here we are.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.953
I think | always wanted to do that.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.252
Ciara.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.086
I can't.

41:13.722 --> 41:16.509
You can't betray a ghost, Dyson.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.021
Good night then.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.576
Ciara.

41:52.844 --> 41:57.929
Ah, ah! Oh god, these are so good!

41:58.016 --> 42:00.223
[LAUREN] I can make more.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.143
More?

42:03.230 --> 42:06.017
Yeah, more. Good.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.975
Bo,buddy.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.777
The platonic love of my life.

42:12.864 --> 42:17.403
Come here. Auren-lay's
ot-nay aying-stay, is she?

42:17.494 --> 42:19.155
Because she's already
messed up the kitchen

42:19.246 --> 42:20.736
and I don't want her
messing up the couch.

42:20.831 --> 42:25.245
Well, she won't. Because I am taking
the couch. Lauren's taking my bed.

42:25.335 --> 42:28.793
No, no, no, no, no,
I couldn't put you out.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.465
And on that "oh, please"
factor of ten, I'm out.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.133
Goodnight!

42:36.972 --> 42:39.554
I will take the couch.

42:42.352 --> 42:45.560
You've just been through
a lot with the Ash.

42:45.647 --> 42:49.606
And I know you took an oath to look
after people medically and all, but...

42:49.693 --> 42:53.527
...you need to let someone else
take care of you for once.

42:56.908 --> 43:01.368
So... goodnight.

43:03.582 --> 43:06.915
Right.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.833
Goodnight.
