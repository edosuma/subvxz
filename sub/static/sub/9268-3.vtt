Mr Leonard, sir!

00:28.950 --> 00:30.829
Sahib?

00:30.830 --> 00:31.990
Sahib?

00:33.230 --> 00:34.270
Sahib!

00:38.790 --> 00:39.950
What is it?

00:41.790 --> 00:43.429
What do you want?

00:43.430 --> 00:46.589
I was pruning the hedges
in the garden,

00:46.590 --> 00:48.310
and I saw something terrible.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.470
Mr Leonard, I'm afraid you
are going to die today.

Thank you, Mrs Parfitt!

01:37.550 --> 01:39.110
Thank you!

01:45.190 --> 01:46.709
How many more?

01:46.710 --> 01:47.830
Just a half dozen.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.909
Lady Felicia.
You do look a picture.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.629
Father Brown. Mrs McCarthy.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.750
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

01:57.751 --> 01:58.829
Not at all.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.828
Only I wondered if you'd care to
accompany me to a poetry recital?

02:01.829 --> 02:03.028
I know it's short notice,

02:03.029 --> 02:05.268
but the host specifically requested
your presence.

02:05.269 --> 02:07.308
Indeed, he was quite insistent.

02:07.309 --> 02:09.548
Father Brown is in the middle
of auditions.

02:09.549 --> 02:11.310
Which, I'm sure, can wait.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.229
Who, might I ask, is the host?

02:15.230 --> 02:18.390
One of her highfalutin cronies,
I shouldn't wonder.

02:19.790 --> 02:20.949
Mr Quinton.

02:20.950 --> 02:21.989
Mmm.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.389
Not Leonard Quinton?

02:24.390 --> 02:25.630
Mm-hmm.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.909
I've always enjoyed a nice sonnet.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.830
Especially that Greek one.
The one about the vase.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.990
Urn.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.030
If you will.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.189
Did Mr Quinton say why he wanted me
to attend?

02:53.190 --> 02:55.990
I'm afraid he's a peculiar
man of very few words.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.668
I don't like to gossip, but rumour
has it he's lost his marbles.

03:00.669 --> 03:04.708
Have you met the wife? Is it true
she never leaves the house?

03:04.709 --> 03:06.670
And that he keeps an Indian hermit?

03:07.870 --> 03:09.750
Like you, I don't like to gossip.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.830
Hello!

03:33.950 --> 03:35.549
She's very young.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.990
Welcome.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.548
It's such an honour to meet you.

03:42.549 --> 03:44.788
I wanted to go to your
finishing school,

03:44.789 --> 03:47.428
but Papa told me you'd have
nothing to teach me.

03:47.429 --> 03:50.790
On account of my own natural grace.
Not your instruction.

03:50.791 --> 03:52.869
Is that Christian Dior?

03:52.870 --> 03:56.470
His designs are so flattering
for mature women, aren't they?

03:56.471 --> 03:57.510
Lady Felicia.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.228
Your husband is a very good client.

04:01.229 --> 04:04.908
I try not to get involved
with my husband's business affairs.

04:04.909 --> 04:08.110
Better to enjoy the spoils.
I'm sure you've earned it.

04:11.470 --> 04:14.588
What a delightful home.
Such curious artefacts.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.428
Yes. Lenny will be so pleased
you could make it.

04:17.428 --> 04:19.748
We're very much looking forward
to meeting him,

04:19.749 --> 04:21.067
aren't we, Mrs McCarthy?

04:21.069 --> 04:25.030
Yes, and I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance, Mrs Quinton.

04:25.031 --> 04:28.949
Oh! No, Lenny and I aren't married.

04:28.950 --> 04:29.990
Not yet, anyway.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.230
Come, do follow me.

04:34.590 --> 04:37.988
Oh, I'm afraid the train from
Paddington was cancelled

04:37.989 --> 04:40.750
so it's going to be
a rather intimate gathering.

04:43.030 --> 04:47.270
I'm ashamed to say that Violet
is Leonard's mistress,

04:48.270 --> 04:51.389
and almost as insufferable
as he is.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.470
How very French.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.709
Mrs Quinton.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.310
And the great man himself!

05:16.070 --> 05:20.149
Namaste.
Thank you all so much for coming.

05:20.150 --> 05:24.509
I realise our domestic arrangements
might seem a little odd,

05:24.510 --> 05:26.470
but I assure you they
are mutually agreeable.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.550
Do take a seat.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.790
May I have a quick word first?

05:35.190 --> 05:38.028
I must confess I'm intrigued to why
you've invited me here today.

05:38.029 --> 05:40.150
I'm not known for my literary
prowess.

05:41.190 --> 05:44.390
And you clearly look East
for spiritual guidance.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.670
She had a smile that used to
light up the room.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.190
Mr Quinton, is there something
you'd like to share with me?

06:01.030 --> 06:03.910
I would like you to look
after my wife, Father,

06:03.911 --> 06:06.149
if anything should happen to me.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.989
She's one of yours.

06:07.990 --> 06:10.550
But I'm afraid she's lost
her way a little.

06:10.551 --> 06:11.749
You have my word.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.110
I will help her to God's counsel
in any way I can.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.510
But what do you imagine
is going to happen to you?

06:23.630 --> 06:25.830
Let's not waste no more time,
shall we?

06:26.950 --> 06:29.230
Violet, my dear. Perhaps
you'd like to begin?

06:41.430 --> 06:46.029
Aadhaaranilayah, adhaataa,
pushpahaasah, prajaagarah,

06:46.030 --> 06:51.789
oordhvagah, satpathaachaarah,
praanadah...

06:51.790 --> 06:56.350
Entwined in the long grass,

06:57.710 --> 06:59.990
sun freckling buttocks,

07:01.150 --> 07:06.470
The last thing on our minds
are priests in cassocks.

07:07.990 --> 07:12.270
My pulse races
as he traces his finger

07:13.310 --> 07:17.989
'cross creamy white skin,
with a lovely linger.

07:17.990 --> 07:21.549
'Twas as if we were otters,

07:21.550 --> 07:27.509
frolicking as hot as
a great ball of fire

07:27.510 --> 07:30.150
in the wet sand.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.109
Oh, yes!

07:35.110 --> 07:36.749
YES!

07:36.750 --> 07:43.830
I cry to the skies
with quivering thighs.

07:44.830 --> 07:49.310
It doesn't seem wise
to dwell on the lies.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.790
But my heart goes cold,

07:53.910 --> 07:56.070
and I can't help but fidget,

07:57.150 --> 08:03.430
As the band of gold I spy
wrapped around his digit.

08:05.430 --> 08:08.589
Alas! Alack!

08:08.590 --> 08:10.670
There's no going back.

08:13.030 --> 08:18.350
Till she loosen the noose
and cut him loose.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.910
Forever.

08:32.710 --> 08:39.589
Paapa-naashanah, samkha-bhrit,
nandakee, chakree, shaarnga-dhanvaa,

08:39.590 --> 08:44.350
gadaadharah, rathaanga-paanih,
akshobhyah, sarva-praharanaayudhah.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.109
It slithers out white,

08:58.110 --> 08:59.270
sticky.

09:00.430 --> 09:01.630
Lump meets stump.

09:02.830 --> 09:06.109
Blood thumping, pumping.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.510
Bone against bone.

09:08.870 --> 09:10.989
Howls crunching.

09:10.990 --> 09:12.070
Retch.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.670
If I could.

09:16.830 --> 09:17.870
If I hadn't.

09:18.910 --> 09:19.950
If you were.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.070
Hands.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.229
No, feet.

09:27.230 --> 09:28.270
Clasping air.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.670
Gasp in pain.

09:33.350 --> 09:34.390
Unfurled.

09:36.230 --> 09:41.350
Horror swaddled in twisted
crimson ribbons.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.150
Vomiting love.

09:45.190 --> 09:46.430
Self-pity.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.230
Shame.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.590
Please excuse me.

10:33.510 --> 10:35.028
What was that about?
Sssh!

10:35.029 --> 10:37.310
And why were
we invited to witness it?

10:37.311 --> 10:39.549
We weren't all invited.

10:39.550 --> 10:40.590
You mustn't look.

10:41.990 --> 10:45.670
Lenny hasn't let me see it yet
and I sat for him for hours.

10:45.671 --> 10:47.110
In my birthday suit!

10:48.390 --> 10:50.470
Your father must be very proud.

10:50.471 --> 10:53.749
Forgive me,
is Mr Quinton in poor health?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.109
Not physically.

10:55.110 --> 10:57.150
Only these are academic
medical text books.

10:57.151 --> 10:59.909
He's a man. Ergo a hypochondriac.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.910
Lenny used to be a Doctor.
He had a practice on Harley Street.

11:05.310 --> 11:07.668
Please don't mention it to him.
He gets very upset.

11:07.669 --> 11:08.708
I can't imagine why.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.188
It's his behaviour since
that brings him into disrepute.

11:11.189 --> 11:12.549
The man's a buffoon.

11:12.550 --> 11:15.748
He's talking about converting the
stables into a levitation centre,

11:15.749 --> 11:16.948
for goodness sake!

11:16.949 --> 11:20.630
Meditation centre, based on the
teachings of Krishna, Shankara

11:20.631 --> 11:23.549
and the yoga sutras of Patanjali.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.709
Is he a client of yours, too?

11:25.710 --> 11:28.348
I don't have to like my clients
to do my job.

11:28.349 --> 11:31.428
Though I'd never have taken him
on if it weren't for his wife.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.550
Martha and I are old family friends.

11:37.670 --> 11:38.709
Mrs Quinton!

11:38.710 --> 11:41.148
I'm quite all right, thank you,
Father. You're shaking.

11:41.149 --> 11:43.990
I said I'm fine! It's Leonard that's
feeling a little out of sorts.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.149
Poor Lenny!

11:45.150 --> 11:47.948
Mr Harris, could you take our guests
for a stroll round the garden

11:47.949 --> 11:49.308
while he takes a nap? Of course.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.748
I'll make sure tea arrives
promptly upon your return.

11:51.749 --> 11:54.628
I'll wait here, in case Lenny
wakes and calls for me.

11:54.629 --> 11:55.748
Do what you like.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.188
Shouldn't we call a doctor?

11:57.189 --> 11:59.628
No, that won't be necessary.
He's just a little tired.

11:59.629 --> 12:01.948
Perhaps I might speak with
Mr Quinton privately?

12:01.949 --> 12:04.230
No, he explicitly asked to
be left alone.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.189
A walk would be lovely.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.590
A breath of fresh air will do us
all the world of good.

12:09.591 --> 12:10.989
Do follow me.

12:10.990 --> 12:14.470
I gather they have an extremely
rare collection of tropical plants!

12:23.430 --> 12:26.910
I wish my Parson's Pink
would repeat-flower like that.

12:28.510 --> 12:31.508
The Quintons have an odd
relationship, don't you think?

12:31.509 --> 12:32.830
It's none of my business.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.308
Who's the Indian gentleman?

12:36.309 --> 12:38.030
Martha calls him the gardener.

12:38.031 --> 12:41.349
Leonard calls him
his spiritual advisor.

12:41.350 --> 12:43.949
I call him a fake and extortionist.

12:43.950 --> 12:45.629
Oh?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.950
He brought him back from his trip
to the Raj.

12:47.951 --> 12:50.669
Parades him round
like an exotic pet.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.508
No doubt he's brainwashed Leonard
out of thousands,

12:53.509 --> 12:57.270
promising to ward off evil spirits
in return for a small fee.

12:57.271 --> 13:00.829
Corruption's endemic
in their culture, I'm afraid.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.150
Have you been to India?

13:03.510 --> 13:06.428
I couldn't care less how Mr Quinton
fritters away his money.

13:06.429 --> 13:09.508
I dare say his wife might have
something to say about that.

13:09.509 --> 13:12.308
His wife seems curiously
silent on a number of subjects,

13:12.309 --> 13:14.268
the sort of woman who does
her duty for 20 years

13:14.269 --> 13:15.788
and then does something dreadful.

13:15.789 --> 13:17.830
If she did, could you blame her?

13:20.550 --> 13:23.150
Come, we need to stick together.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.869
Now what is this one called?

14:03.870 --> 14:07.870
It looks like oleander but I think
it's something far more unusual.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.908
I don't think this is a proper path.

14:11.909 --> 14:13.590
I think we must have taken
a wrong turn.

14:13.591 --> 14:19.229
And if I am not mistaken, all
the plants in this bed are poisonous.

14:19.230 --> 14:21.030
How horrible.
Oh!

14:22.230 --> 14:23.509
Lady Felicia!

14:23.510 --> 14:26.550
I tripped over that
and I've broken my heel!

14:26.551 --> 14:28.509
Mangy beast.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.870
All ears and fleas.
Martha always hated that cat.

14:32.510 --> 14:33.550
What's this?

14:35.190 --> 14:36.430
Poor creature.

14:39.150 --> 14:42.149
All creation, O Lord,
is in your care.

14:42.150 --> 14:44.708
Give us eyes to see that every
living creature

14:44.709 --> 14:45.870
speaks to us of your love.

14:48.550 --> 14:49.669
Amen.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.348
I think I may need some help.

14:51.349 --> 14:55.108
Looks like a bad sprain.
I'll go and fetch the first aid kit.

14:55.109 --> 14:57.510
And what are we supposed to
do in the meantime?

15:01.990 --> 15:05.990
I looked at your painting.

15:11.670 --> 15:12.750
Well?

15:14.630 --> 15:15.670
Say something!

15:22.510 --> 15:24.110
I gave up everything for you!

15:30.550 --> 15:32.670
You're never going to leave her,
are you?

15:35.270 --> 15:36.950
I hope you rot to death in hell!

15:46.030 --> 15:47.908
I thought we'd never
find our way back.

15:47.909 --> 15:50.308
Well, if you will wear those
ridiculous shoes.

15:50.309 --> 15:53.270
Was it a poem,
or an instrument of torture?

15:53.271 --> 15:55.269
And about time too!

15:55.270 --> 15:56.430
Sorry I took so long.

15:59.350 --> 16:00.990
Aaaah!

16:10.230 --> 16:11.310
Stand back.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.190
Is everything OK?
I thought I heard...

16:17.191 --> 16:18.390
Aaaah!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.390
Mrs McCarthy.

16:36.310 --> 16:37.350
Lenny!

16:49.310 --> 16:50.630
It seems he left a note.

16:54.870 --> 16:57.150
Umesh,
will you call the police, please?

17:22.109 --> 17:26.748
Wheresover the body shall be, there
shall the eagles also be gathered.

17:26.749 --> 17:28.908
Gospel of Matthew
if I'm not mistaken.

17:28.909 --> 17:31.830
And you're always complaining
I'm after your job.

17:31.831 --> 17:33.629
Milk, one sugar.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.069
That's how Lenny liked it.

17:36.070 --> 17:37.749
Thank you.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.070
We found this on the conservatory
bench, Inspector.

17:43.510 --> 17:45.790
Not the most illuminating
final missive.

17:48.550 --> 17:51.710
Mrs Quinton, can you confirm this
is your husband's handwriting?

17:56.150 --> 17:59.070
Please accept my condolences.
If there's anything...

17:59.071 --> 18:00.350
Nothing.

18:04.590 --> 18:07.830
Death has been certified.
Could you show the doctor out?

18:11.470 --> 18:13.468
Shall we join
the countess in the study?

18:13.469 --> 18:16.790
I'm sure Inspector Valentine
has everything in hand.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.870
What a perfectly awful day.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.870
You think he might have waited
till after we'd gone.

18:32.871 --> 18:36.589
He was worried how his wife would
cope by herself.

18:36.590 --> 18:38.428
She barely seems to have noticed.

18:38.429 --> 18:40.350
I imagine that was Father Brown's
point.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.828
This is a very fine oolong.

18:43.829 --> 18:47.348
Such a shame the pot wasn't
warmed before pouring in water.

18:47.349 --> 18:49.308
Next time you can make it yourself.

18:49.309 --> 18:52.910
Though, of course, that would
involve setting foot in a kitchen.

18:54.270 --> 18:56.590
I wonder what made such
a distinguished man of science

18:56.591 --> 18:58.989
throw off medicine.

18:58.990 --> 19:01.748
Maybe something happened
on his trip to India.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.028
How long did you say you'd
known him?

19:04.029 --> 19:07.428
I didn't. Truth be told,
I only met him a fortnight ago.

19:07.429 --> 19:10.508
We were introduced at a charity
gala in London.

19:10.509 --> 19:12.630
He was with that Hindu fellow,
I think.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.428
I'm afraid I don't remember our
conversation quite so well

19:16.429 --> 19:18.708
as the headache I had the
following morning.

19:18.709 --> 19:21.510
Really, you'd think I'd be used
to champagne by now.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.710
I need find Inspector Valentine.

19:26.790 --> 19:31.148
No, perhaps I should talk to the
Hindu gentleman in private first.

19:31.149 --> 19:33.150
Yes. Best to have all the facts.

19:37.190 --> 19:39.108
Mrs McCarthy, would you
round everybody up

19:39.109 --> 19:40.908
and bring them to the drawing room?

19:40.909 --> 19:43.750
I have something very important
to tell you all.

19:43.751 --> 19:45.389
I'll explain shortly.

19:45.390 --> 19:48.750
But no-one must leave. And no-one
must be left on their own!

19:52.990 --> 19:57.949
♪ Dehino 'smin yatha dehe

19:57.950 --> 20:02.989
♪ Kaumaram yauvanam jara

20:02.990 --> 20:08.469
♪ Tatha dehantara-praptir

20:08.470 --> 20:12.710
♪ Dhiras tatra na muhyati. ♪

20:14.670 --> 20:17.829
I don't believe we've
been introduced.

20:17.830 --> 20:19.990
My name is Father Brown.

20:22.630 --> 20:23.870
Umesh Varma.

20:25.110 --> 20:27.910
I used to be a tour guide
at the Botanical Gardens in Cochin.

20:28.910 --> 20:30.350
It's where I first met Leonard.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.990
I understand you
and Leonard were good friends.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.150
He was a good man.

20:37.230 --> 20:38.270
A kind man.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.790
But I'm afraid his soul
was in torment.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.510
Did you discover the cause
of his sorrow?

20:48.150 --> 20:50.829
Mr Leonard was a very private man.

20:50.830 --> 20:52.550
I would never betray a confidence.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.950
Did Martha and Leonard
lose a child?

20:58.030 --> 21:00.150
May I ask what
business it is of yours?

21:01.950 --> 21:05.109
Leonard asked me
to look after his wife.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.350
By poking round his house
and digging up the past?

21:08.350 --> 21:10.150
I only want to uncover the truth.

21:10.151 --> 21:12.949
The truth is not always
black and white.

21:12.950 --> 21:14.110
It's over.

21:15.710 --> 21:17.190
Why can't you leave it at that?

21:29.950 --> 21:32.350
I'm told you have some important
information to share.

21:34.310 --> 21:39.589
I think we'd all agree Mr Quinton
was a deeply troubled man.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.189
Married to her?
Who can blame him?

21:42.190 --> 21:44.269
The woman's not human.

21:44.270 --> 21:48.189
You could cut off her head,
she wouldn't bat an eyelid.

21:48.190 --> 21:51.548
Some people are simply able to
keep their emotions in check.

21:51.549 --> 21:54.510
Please understand the last thing
I want to do in these awful

21:54.511 --> 21:57.989
circumstances is to cause you
further distress.

21:57.990 --> 21:59.590
Get to the point, please, Father.

22:00.870 --> 22:04.669
I'm afraid Mr Quinton could not
have hanged himself.

22:04.670 --> 22:08.149
But we saw it. He even left a note!

22:08.150 --> 22:09.429
Go on.

22:09.430 --> 22:10.988
Leonard was left-handed,

22:10.989 --> 22:12.990
as evidenced by the slope
of his handwriting

22:12.991 --> 22:15.229
and the arrangement of his desk.

22:15.230 --> 22:16.549
Yes. And?

22:16.550 --> 22:20.590
The knot of rope around Mr Quinton's
neck was tied right over left.

22:22.070 --> 22:26.109
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

22:26.110 --> 22:28.310
He's saying Leonard was murdered.

22:36.310 --> 22:38.308
We need a pathologist
here as soon as possible.

22:38.309 --> 22:39.708
I want the conservatory locked

22:39.709 --> 22:41.508
and an officer outside
both sets of doors.

22:41.509 --> 22:44.110
Search the grounds for anything
suspicious.

22:46.310 --> 22:48.548
No doubt you have theories.
A number of theories...

22:48.549 --> 22:50.548
And I'm grateful for your insight
so far.

22:50.549 --> 22:52.548
But from now this is a murder
investigation,

22:52.549 --> 22:54.870
so perhaps you could leave
the questions to me.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.150
Mrs Quinton,

23:01.190 --> 23:04.150
did you and your husband
have any children?

23:04.151 --> 23:05.349
No.

23:05.350 --> 23:08.110
So I assume you're the main
beneficiary in your husband's will?

23:08.111 --> 23:09.309
Murderer!

23:09.310 --> 23:11.469
It's obvious it was her.

23:11.470 --> 23:12.549
She hated him.

23:12.550 --> 23:13.748
She's not the only one.

23:13.749 --> 23:15.670
I'll be interviewing
everyone in due course

23:15.671 --> 23:19.749
so you'll have ample opportunity
to express your opinions.

23:19.750 --> 23:23.268
Mrs Quinton, could you answer
the question, please?

23:23.269 --> 23:25.990
I believe he planned to leave me
the house.

23:25.991 --> 23:28.469
And the rest of his fortune?

23:28.470 --> 23:31.190
I'm afraid Mr Quinton recently
altered his will

23:31.191 --> 23:35.069
and bequeathed the rest
of his fortune to Mr Varma.

23:35.070 --> 23:36.270
Our gardener.

23:39.510 --> 23:42.428
Mr Varma,
if you'll permit the observation,

23:42.429 --> 23:45.908
you didn't seem surprised to come
upon Leonard's body this morning.

23:45.909 --> 23:48.150
That's because I knew Leonard
was going to die.

23:51.470 --> 23:54.030
And how could you possibly
know that?

23:54.031 --> 23:55.230
I had a vision.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.869
A vision?

23:58.870 --> 24:01.229
Well, not a vision exactly.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.908
It came to me more as a colour,

24:02.909 --> 24:05.428
when I was pruning
the hedges this morning.

24:05.429 --> 24:07.388
And I saw the othalanga in bloom.

24:07.389 --> 24:09.110
Oh, that's the name of it!

24:10.110 --> 24:12.028
Also known as the Suicide Tree,

24:12.029 --> 24:14.190
because its kernels are deadly
poisonous.

24:15.190 --> 24:16.790
As soon as I saw it in flower,

24:18.390 --> 24:20.030
I knew he was going to die today.

24:21.390 --> 24:25.989
Just as I know this priest will
uncover how and why

24:25.990 --> 24:27.790
and that the truth will be
sadder still.

24:29.270 --> 24:30.789
You don't believe me?

24:30.790 --> 24:33.948
I believe there is normally
a rational explanation

24:33.949 --> 24:35.108
for the phenomenal.

24:35.109 --> 24:36.990
So how do you explain your bible?

24:37.990 --> 24:39.989
Didn't Jesus walk on water?

24:39.990 --> 24:42.388
Feed thousands with
a single loaf of bread?

24:42.389 --> 24:44.950
I also believe the world becomes
a very dangerous place

24:44.951 --> 24:48.669
when we interpret holy
scripture too literally.

24:48.670 --> 24:51.510
But there are so many things that
happen which we cannot explain.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.390
If you'll excuse me, please.

25:37.750 --> 25:40.388
So you're telling me
you have the gift of second sight?

25:40.389 --> 25:43.590
I wouldn't call it a gift, no.
I'm a spiritual man.

25:45.790 --> 25:49.030
Did you know Mr Quinton was planning
to bequeath you his fortune?

25:49.031 --> 25:50.909
Yes.

25:50.910 --> 25:53.028
And what were you planning to do
with the money?

25:53.029 --> 25:54.990
Give it to charity.
A likely story.

25:59.430 --> 26:01.788
I found this washed up
by the lake, sir.

26:01.789 --> 26:03.708
What is it? Some kind of effigy?

26:03.709 --> 26:06.750
I was saying
Vishnu Sahasranama for Leonard.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.109
In English?

26:10.110 --> 26:14.669
It's a prayer to invoke
the thousand names of Vishnu.

26:14.670 --> 26:17.989
Leonard was teaching me...

26:17.990 --> 26:21.310
I believe we all have a thousand
names. A thousand guises.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.348
Where were you between
11 and 12 this morning?

26:28.349 --> 26:31.468
I was in the kitchen making pinda.
Rice ball offerings.

26:31.469 --> 26:34.268
To nourish Leonard's soul
on it's onward journey.

26:34.269 --> 26:36.390
Before he was actually dead.
Yes.

26:37.510 --> 26:39.630
While someone next door
murdered him?

26:39.631 --> 26:41.069
So it would seem.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.430
Oh, I've heard it all now!

26:45.030 --> 26:47.469
I saw the headstone this morning.

26:47.470 --> 26:49.990
Please accept my sincerest
condolences.

27:06.030 --> 27:07.950
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

27:09.230 --> 27:12.390
It has been 16 months since
my last confession.

27:13.830 --> 27:16.428
Mr Varma, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

27:16.429 --> 27:18.908
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so

27:18.909 --> 27:21.068
but whatever you say will be taken
down in writing

27:21.069 --> 27:22.990
and may be given in evidence.
Wait!

27:24.390 --> 27:26.030
She died a year ago today.

27:29.870 --> 27:33.670
Her name was Olivia.

27:36.830 --> 27:38.670
You have her
photograph in your locket?

27:40.190 --> 27:41.270
A lock of her hair.

27:46.310 --> 27:48.190
We didn't take any photographs.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.670
She was handed to me in a blanket,
so all I could see was her face.

28:03.670 --> 28:04.830
Her beautiful face.

28:09.430 --> 28:12.670
But when the midwife brought me
a cup of tea a few minutes later,

28:14.990 --> 28:16.910
I remember her hands shaking.

28:20.590 --> 28:22.190
And then I looked at Leonard,

28:24.030 --> 28:26.710
and realised something was
terribly, terribly wrong.

28:30.790 --> 28:35.030
She was born grotesquely deformed.

28:37.710 --> 28:39.310
Some limbs missing,

28:41.390 --> 28:42.710
others the wrong shape.

28:46.150 --> 28:47.470
Leonard never said a word.

28:49.670 --> 28:50.910
Couldn't even look at me.

28:52.510 --> 28:55.550
He ran off to India before I was
discharged from hospital.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.910
I couldn't bear for her
to be gossiped about,

29:04.030 --> 29:07.590
paraded through medical circles
like some monstrous curiosity,

29:10.550 --> 29:15.350
so I decided to keep her secret.

29:17.910 --> 29:20.990
I gave up the London flat
and I moved here permanently.

29:23.990 --> 29:28.150
Leonard came back three months
afterwards, and she...

29:34.390 --> 29:37.270
died a few hours later.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.510
It was as if she'd been waiting
for him.

29:48.110 --> 29:52.990
We buried her in the garden
and then we went our separate ways,

29:55.230 --> 29:57.830
albeit under the same
roof for appearance's sake.

30:02.270 --> 30:04.150
We never talked about her again.

30:08.630 --> 30:11.510
I didn't even know he still thought
about her until this morning.

30:13.350 --> 30:14.390
The poem.

30:15.430 --> 30:19.149
I thought he was deliberately
trying to hurt me.

30:19.150 --> 30:23.709
I realise now that

30:23.710 --> 30:26.230
that was the only way he
could express himself.

30:33.390 --> 30:34.790
I thought he was under arrest?

30:36.590 --> 30:40.308
Lady Felicia has belatedly recalled
hearing Mr Varma speak publicly

30:40.309 --> 30:43.268
about his plans to set up
a leprosy charity

30:43.269 --> 30:45.030
whilst at a gala in London.

30:45.031 --> 30:46.190
So?

30:47.230 --> 30:50.150
Whilst it doesn't explain how
he predicted Mr Quinton's death

30:50.151 --> 30:54.589
hours before it occurred,
it does cast doubt on his motives.

30:54.590 --> 30:58.990
Unless he murdered Lenny
to save the lepers?

31:02.190 --> 31:04.469
Does this mean we can't go home?

31:04.470 --> 31:05.550
I'm afraid so.

31:09.030 --> 31:13.188
I understand Mr Harris, Father
Brown, Mrs McCarthy and Lady Felicia

31:13.189 --> 31:16.910
were on a tour of the gardens
between 11 and 12 this morning.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.070
Miss Parnassus, where were you?

31:22.350 --> 31:23.669
I was in here.

31:23.670 --> 31:24.710
All the time?

31:26.390 --> 31:27.469
Yes!

31:27.470 --> 31:28.590
She's lying.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.469
I heard her in the study.

31:31.470 --> 31:35.189
She and Leonard were arguing.
Very heatedly, in fact.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.350
She was furious with him
for not leaving his wife.

31:38.670 --> 31:44.269
If I remember correctly, she wanted
him to rot to death in hell.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.349
Oh, dear.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.590
Miss Parnassus?

31:49.030 --> 31:50.430
We...

31:51.430 --> 31:53.070
We had an argument,

31:54.230 --> 31:56.310
and I said some very silly things.

31:57.630 --> 31:59.510
I'm a passionate woman!

32:05.190 --> 32:08.708
And how did you overhear all of this
if you were in the garden?

32:08.709 --> 32:10.428
I came back to fetch
the first aid kit

32:10.429 --> 32:12.230
when Lady Felicia twisted her ankle.

32:12.231 --> 32:16.709
In any case, how could I possibly
have strung him up like that?

32:16.710 --> 32:18.748
Mr Quinton wasn't a large man.

32:18.749 --> 32:21.230
I imagine whoever killed him
used the trolley we found

32:21.231 --> 32:24.069
collapsed at the scene
to move his body,

32:24.070 --> 32:26.628
climbed the conservatory benches
and attached one end of

32:26.629 --> 32:29.828
the curtain cord to the plant hook
in the ceiling,

32:29.829 --> 32:32.550
tied the other round his neck
and then pushed the trolley over

32:32.551 --> 32:34.949
to make it look like suicide.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.150
It could have been any one of you.

32:37.151 --> 32:39.670
Even you, Mr Harris.

32:41.550 --> 32:44.950
Don't be ridiculous.
You hated him as much as she did.

32:46.630 --> 32:49.349
It's no secret I never liked the man

32:49.350 --> 32:51.670
but what could I possibly stand
to gain from his death?

32:53.990 --> 32:56.670
When I confronted Leonard
after the recital,

32:56.671 --> 33:01.030
he told me that Olivia's condition
was his fault.

33:08.630 --> 33:11.030
It took us a long time to conceive.

33:13.110 --> 33:15.628
And I suffered very badly
with morning sickness.

33:15.629 --> 33:19.548
I was terrified I was going to
miscarry, so he prescribed me

33:19.549 --> 33:22.868
a new drug he'd heard about
on a trip to Germany.

33:22.869 --> 33:24.348
He wasn't able to prove anything

33:24.349 --> 33:27.548
but he was convinced that's what
caused her birth defects.

33:27.549 --> 33:29.430
Which is why he gave up medicine.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.430
Must have made you very angry.

33:38.430 --> 33:39.550
Worse than that.

33:42.790 --> 33:44.070
I felt relieved.

33:48.070 --> 33:49.910
Because if it was his fault...

33:51.030 --> 33:53.030
Then perhaps it wasn't mine.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.949
Beginner's luck.

34:06.950 --> 34:08.989
Oh, is that what you call it?

34:08.989 --> 34:11.828
One doesn't need extrasensory
perception to predict your moves.

34:11.829 --> 34:13.148
You're always on the defence.

34:13.149 --> 34:15.788
And you've got too many men
round the edges!

34:15.789 --> 34:18.027
We'll need to take formal
statements from everyone

34:18.029 --> 34:20.467
while we wait for the
pathologist's report.

34:20.469 --> 34:21.830
Perhaps we might use the study?

34:24.909 --> 34:26.190
How is she?

34:28.590 --> 34:32.510
Mrs McCarthy, what's the botanical
name of the Suicide Tree?

34:32.511 --> 34:33.630
Cerbera Odollam.

34:40.830 --> 34:43.590
Inspector, would it be possible to
have another look at the body?

35:17.470 --> 35:22.230
Yes, very likely. Thank you, sarg.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.388
The pathologist will need
to confirm, of course,

35:34.389 --> 35:37.790
but I think I've spotted traces
of toxic white sap

35:37.791 --> 35:40.149
on Mr Quinton's clothes,

35:40.150 --> 35:42.430
which, I'm almost certain
we'll discover,

35:42.431 --> 35:44.749
is from the othalanga tree.

35:44.750 --> 35:47.350
And didn't the dead cat have
something white and sticky

35:47.351 --> 35:48.389
on its paws?

35:48.390 --> 35:50.670
Didn't you say Mrs Quinton
hated that cat?

35:50.671 --> 35:51.709
That's hearsay.

35:51.710 --> 35:52.749
Nevertheless...

35:52.750 --> 35:55.909
I knew it was her! I knew it!

35:55.910 --> 35:59.269
She has no alibi and
an established motive.

35:59.270 --> 36:00.788
I'd like to examine her clothes.

36:00.789 --> 36:02.108
She'll hang for this!

36:02.109 --> 36:03.430
It had nothing to do with her!

36:04.710 --> 36:06.150
Or with toxic sap.

36:09.470 --> 36:11.349
How can you be so certain?

36:11.350 --> 36:12.670
Because it was me.

36:14.830 --> 36:16.909
I murdered Leonard Quinton.

36:16.910 --> 36:18.430
Are you sure?

36:20.070 --> 36:23.068
After I left you in the garden
I went back to the house

36:23.069 --> 36:27.028
and waited till Violet left the
study and Leonard fell asleep.

36:27.029 --> 36:30.830
Then I came up behind him and
strangled him with a curtain cord.

36:33.150 --> 36:36.068
The rest happened
exactly as you surmised.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.790
You forged the suicide note?

36:37.791 --> 36:40.869
The study was littered
with his scrawlings.

36:40.870 --> 36:43.188
He'd fallen asleep near a notebook.

36:43.189 --> 36:46.230
I simply tore out a sheet of paper
and copied his hand.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.269
Inspector, as far as I'm aware,

36:51.270 --> 36:54.590
it is impossible to arrest
a man for killing a corpse.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.028
I beg your pardon?

36:58.029 --> 37:01.188
Mr Harris, I'm afraid when
you returned to the house,

37:01.189 --> 37:03.588
you were in such a hurry
to kill Mr Quinton

37:03.589 --> 37:06.150
you failed to notice that
he was already dead.

37:07.470 --> 37:08.749
What?

37:08.750 --> 37:12.030
The notebook you mentioned,
you took it with you, I presume?

37:14.750 --> 37:17.948
If you hadn't been in such a hurry
to forge a suicide note,

37:17.949 --> 37:20.190
you might have found the one
he'd already written.

37:21.230 --> 37:25.629
It's my belief that Mr Leonard
Quinton poisoned himself

37:25.630 --> 37:28.270
by ingesting kernels
from the Suicide Tree.

37:29.430 --> 37:34.390
Possibly after experimenting with
the correct dosage on his pet cat.

37:36.750 --> 37:40.348
"I deeply regret the pain and
suffering I have caused my wife

37:40.349 --> 37:43.710
"and no longer wish to punish
her with my presence."

37:43.711 --> 37:47.949
"Please forgive my cowardice
and help her to a better life."

37:47.950 --> 37:50.389
I thought he loved me!

37:50.390 --> 37:52.788
Darling, men are duplicitous
and fickle.

37:52.789 --> 37:55.548
Better you learn that now,
while there's still time.

37:55.549 --> 37:58.068
Until the post mortem, we can't be
certain that Mr Quinton

37:58.069 --> 38:00.590
was already dead
when he strangled him.

38:00.591 --> 38:05.669
Therefore, Mr Harris, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

38:05.670 --> 38:08.388
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so

38:08.389 --> 38:10.990
but whatever you do say will
be taken down in writing

38:10.991 --> 38:12.990
and may be given in evidence.

38:14.310 --> 38:17.229
If you hated him this much,

38:17.230 --> 38:21.429
why were you always making excuses
to come round?

38:21.430 --> 38:24.630
Am I the only one who noticed
how often he looked at Martha?

38:24.631 --> 38:27.269
How quick he was to defend her?

38:27.270 --> 38:29.590
I thought if I didn't kill him,
she would.

38:30.950 --> 38:33.390
At least I'd have the sense
to cover it up.

38:33.391 --> 38:34.430
Or try.

38:35.710 --> 38:39.830
And then after a decent interval
I could tell her how I felt and...

38:41.270 --> 38:43.230
What made you think
she was capable of murder?

38:44.230 --> 38:46.949
She pathologically
hated her husband.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.949
Shuddered when he so much
as looked at her.

38:49.950 --> 38:51.150
Then there was the dead cat.

38:52.190 --> 38:55.028
And when I thought about how
fiercely she insisted

38:55.029 --> 38:59.150
Leonard needed a nap, and the
medication she'd been hoarding...

38:59.151 --> 39:01.029
What medication?

39:01.030 --> 39:02.510
I discovered this morning.

39:03.590 --> 39:05.630
She'd been stock-piling
her sleeping pills.

39:15.470 --> 39:18.030
May we have a moment alone,
please, Inspector?

39:35.670 --> 39:39.110
Every time I looked at him,
I saw her face.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.268
I can't tell you how often

39:43.269 --> 39:45.630
I wished I'd never have to set
eyes upon him again.

39:47.190 --> 39:48.750
And yet now he's gone...

39:52.030 --> 39:54.989
it's like losing her
all over again.

39:54.990 --> 39:59.029
Because despite everything,
you still loved him.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.428
If you've got all the answers,

40:00.429 --> 40:02.988
give me one good reason why I
shouldn't swallow these pills.

40:02.989 --> 40:05.668
The fact you asked the question
must stand for something.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.628
So you're not going to try and tell
me everything happens for a reason?

40:08.629 --> 40:10.110
That this is God's will?

40:11.110 --> 40:13.270
I don't know why your
daughter died.

40:14.270 --> 40:16.710
And I don't know why
God let it happen.

40:16.711 --> 40:19.750
Then what do you know?!

40:20.830 --> 40:23.310
I know that God knows what it is
to lose a child.

40:25.070 --> 40:26.630
And that he is standing next to you.

40:28.030 --> 40:31.430
And that he can't stop you
suffering, but that he loves you

40:32.830 --> 40:34.270
and he loves your daughter

40:35.430 --> 40:39.430
and if you let him into your heart
you will see Olivia again.

40:48.190 --> 40:52.550
I've never heard anyone say her
name out loud before.

40:54.310 --> 40:55.509
Olivia.

40:55.510 --> 40:56.630
Again.

40:59.470 --> 41:00.509
Olivia.

41:00.510 --> 41:01.550
Again.

41:03.870 --> 41:04.910
Olivia.

41:21.830 --> 41:23.549
Mr Varma.

41:23.550 --> 41:25.150
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

41:26.430 --> 41:29.350
Leonard told you about his
daughter's condition, didn't he?

41:45.030 --> 41:46.188
You can stay with me

41:46.189 --> 41:49.230
until you've had a chance
to talk to your parents.

41:49.231 --> 41:51.790
Natural grace, indeed.

42:01.470 --> 42:03.869
You fixed it!

42:03.870 --> 42:06.030
You obviously were never in
the girl guides.

42:06.031 --> 42:08.629
Always fancied
the boy scouts myself.

42:08.630 --> 42:10.628
Hop in. We'll give you a lift home.

42:10.629 --> 42:13.108
Thank you, that's kind,
but Father Brown...

42:13.109 --> 42:16.788
The inspector's already offered to
give him a lift home in his.

42:16.789 --> 42:18.148
Erm... I'm not sure...

42:18.149 --> 42:19.270
You'd rather walk?

42:21.670 --> 42:25.110
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take
the weight off my bunions.

42:31.270 --> 42:33.348
And your chauffeur
must be crying out

42:33.349 --> 42:35.230
for some intelligent conversation.

42:42.110 --> 42:43.989
How is she?

42:43.990 --> 42:48.869
Upstairs, sleeping.
Umesh will take good care of her.

42:48.870 --> 42:51.788
If the post mortem confirms
Mr Quinton was poisoned,

42:51.789 --> 42:52.910
we'll have to let him go.

42:54.710 --> 42:57.910
Mr Harris will always be
a prisoner of his conscience.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.589
For a few weeks, maybe.

42:59.590 --> 43:02.428
Then he'll have forgotten the whole
thing, or edited and refined

43:02.429 --> 43:06.268
what happened till his conduct
is no longer in question.

43:06.269 --> 43:08.230
God created man in his own image.

43:08.231 --> 43:11.429
It's my vocation to remind
people of that.

43:11.430 --> 43:13.309
Even the atheists?

43:13.310 --> 43:15.550
Especially the atheists.

43:23.350 --> 43:25.710
"Play, smile."

43:26.710 --> 43:29.630
"Think of me, pray for me."

43:31.190 --> 43:33.070
"Let my name be spoken
without effort,

43:34.230 --> 43:36.110
"without the ghost
of a shadow upon it."

43:37.710 --> 43:40.309
"Life means all that it ever meant."

43:40.310 --> 43:44.550
"It is the same as it ever was,
there is unbroken continuity."

43:46.710 --> 43:49.750
"Why should I be out of mind
because I am out of sight?"

43:51.590 --> 43:53.110
"I am but waiting for you."

43:54.990 --> 43:59.429
"For an interval,
somewhere very near,

43:59.430 --> 44:00.950
"just round the corner."

44:02.190 --> 44:03.470
"All is well."

44:18.151 --> 44:20.231
De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine.

44:21.222 --> 44:22.422
Domine, exaudi vocem meam.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.542
Fiant aures tuae intendentes,
in vocem deprecationis meae.

44:27.543 --> 44:29.661
Goodbye.

44:29.662 --> 44:34.302
Si iniquitates observabis Domine,
Domine quis sustinebit.

44:35.342 --> 44:42.914
Quia apud te propitiatio est propter
legem tuam sustinui te, Domine.
