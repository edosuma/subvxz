WEBVTT

00:02.927 --> 00:03.919
Morning.

00:04.497 --> 00:05.697
Morning.

00:05.721 --> 00:06.622
(exhales)

00:06.657 --> 00:08.692
- Sleep okay?
- Um uh.  Great!

00:11.117 --> 00:12.690
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:12.715 --> 00:13.915
Sure.

00:14.134 --> 00:16.875
Last night, me wanting to try
that stuff out of the Kama Sutra.

00:17.266 --> 00:19.845
Was that fun for you
or kinda racially insensitive?

00:21.013 --> 00:23.637
Yes. Just because you're in bed
with an India woman

00:23.662 --> 00:25.110
you think that gives you permission

00:25.135 --> 00:28.229
to use crazy positions
from an ancient Indian love manual?

00:28.873 --> 00:31.871
Hey, if you can find a book
called "Weird Sex with White Boys"

00:31.896 --> 00:33.150
I'd be okay with that.

00:33.175 --> 00:34.375
(laughing)

00:35.607 --> 00:38.356
No, no, you know you have such
beautiful eyes.

00:39.226 --> 00:40.582
Have you ever thought about
getting contacts?

00:40.607 --> 00:43.488
I tried in the seventh grade.
I could never get used to them.

00:43.513 --> 00:44.713
Oh. That's too bad.

00:44.738 --> 00:47.442
Yeah. If I had contacts,
I would have been the coolest

00:47.467 --> 00:50.475
Debate Club president ever to be
stuffed into his own cello case.

00:52.733 --> 00:56.452
If you had them on now, you could
see what we're going to do next.

00:59.822 --> 01:01.928
That-That's okay.
I can infer from context.

01:05.154 --> 01:07.103
Hey, Raj, you wanna see a new
magic trick I been working on?

01:07.128 --> 01:08.328
Eh, Howard.

01:08.353 --> 01:11.421
If I may interject here
with a piece of friendly advice.

01:11.446 --> 01:15.260
Is working on magic tricks, really
how you want to spend your time?

01:15.975 --> 01:19.068
Uh, granted,
you're just an engineer, but...

01:20.034 --> 01:23.546
that doesn't mean you might
not someday build a geegaw

01:23.571 --> 01:24.771
or a thingamabob that

01:24.796 --> 01:29.348
that may get you a "thank you" in someone
else's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

01:34.164 --> 01:36.208
Is the trick making him disappear?

01:38.663 --> 01:39.863
Sure, let's see it.

01:40.983 --> 01:42.764
Here.
Shuffle these.

01:42.789 --> 01:43.989
Okay.

01:45.229 --> 01:47.019
Now spread them out on the table.
Face down.

01:47.645 --> 01:49.013
Pick one.
Look at it.

01:49.038 --> 01:50.238
Okay.

01:50.263 --> 01:52.231
Now remember your card.
Put it back in the deck.

01:52.256 --> 01:54.161
Is it any wonder
he doesn't have a doctorate?

01:56.385 --> 01:58.111
Now remind me,
what's your birthday?

01:58.136 --> 01:59.336
October sixth.

01:59.909 --> 02:02.781
Okay, October is the tenth month.

02:02.806 --> 02:07.342
So 10-- one plus zero
is one plus six is seven.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.567
Turn over the seventh card.

02:12.469 --> 02:13.421
How about that!

02:13.446 --> 02:14.646
But, is that your card?

02:14.671 --> 02:16.150
Yes. It is.
Very cool!

02:18.269 --> 02:19.869
Oh it's not cool.

02:19.902 --> 02:24.766
It's a childish trick, designed
to confuse and intrigue simpletons.

02:25.780 --> 02:26.980
How'd you do it?

02:27.826 --> 02:30.037
A magician never reveals his secrets.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.882
But surely a future
Nobel Prize winner can figure it out.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.329
Fine.

02:36.354 --> 02:37.554
Give me a second.

02:41.271 --> 02:44.595
You ever notice when he thinks
real hard it smells like bacon?

02:48.434 --> 02:49.634
- Oh hey!
- Sorry! Oop!

02:49.659 --> 02:51.659
Sorry! Pardon me!
(screams)

02:51.684 --> 02:53.084
Oh, I'm so sorry!

02:53.109 --> 02:54.309
Oh, that was my fault.

02:57.904 --> 03:00.494
Check it out.
I just got contacts.

03:29.893 --> 03:31.678
One, two,

03:31.748 --> 03:34.216
three, four, five.

03:34.217 --> 03:35.067
No way.

03:35.068 --> 03:36.051
That's your card, right?

03:36.052 --> 03:37.552
Seven of clubs!

03:37.553 --> 03:38.920
That is amazing!

03:38.921 --> 03:42.257
It's not amazing.

03:43.893 --> 03:45.894
All magic tricks are merely
a combination

03:45.895 --> 03:47.596
of manipulation
and misdirection

03:47.597 --> 03:52.233
with the occasional dwarf in
a box wiggling his feet.

03:53.136 --> 03:55.203
Oh, really?
So how did I do it?

03:55.204 --> 03:56.805
I don't care how you did it.

03:56.806 --> 04:00.575
I have more important things
to think about.

04:04.213 --> 04:07.449
Clearly, the cards
are marked.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.818
I thought you had more important
things to think about.

04:09.819 --> 04:11.586
I do.
You just happened

04:11.587 --> 04:13.488
to have caught me
on a break.

04:14.924 --> 04:18.226
Oh, let me see
those cards.

04:18.226 --> 04:19.560
Big deal. Not knowing

04:19.562 --> 04:21.096
is part of the fun.

04:21.096 --> 04:22.964
"Not knowing is part
of the fun."

04:22.965 --> 04:24.933
Was that the motto
of your community college?

04:27.036 --> 04:29.404
Hey, guys,
what do you think?

04:29.405 --> 04:30.872
Priya took me
clothes shopping.

04:30.873 --> 04:32.090
Hey, you look great.

04:32.091 --> 04:33.241
Good for you, Priya.

04:33.242 --> 04:35.210
I could never get that stupid
hoodie off him

04:35.211 --> 04:36.178
when we were...

04:36.179 --> 04:37.312
Well, you look great.

04:37.313 --> 04:38.747
Thank you.

04:38.748 --> 04:40.382
Lets go hang
everything up.

04:40.383 --> 04:41.800
Yeah, good.

04:43.553 --> 04:45.086
New contacts.

04:45.087 --> 04:47.422
I should have done this
years ago.

04:49.659 --> 04:52.961
So you finally getting used to
them doing it on a daily basis?

04:52.962 --> 04:54.096
I'm not going out with him.

04:54.097 --> 04:55.564
He can sleep
with whoever he wants.

04:55.565 --> 04:58.300
Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

05:02.739 --> 05:04.840
Oopsy.

05:04.841 --> 05:06.375
This deck is rigged in
some fashion.

05:06.376 --> 05:07.342
Fine. Get another deck

05:07.343 --> 05:08.677
and I'll do
the trick with that.

05:08.678 --> 05:10.278
So you're saying this is
a regulation deck?

05:10.279 --> 05:13.181
I'm saying believe in magic,
you muggle.

05:16.719 --> 05:19.654
You know, well, I'm happy
Leonard's found someone.

05:21.824 --> 05:24.226
Not that anybody asked.

05:28.831 --> 05:31.433
How many <i>Star Trek</i> uniforms
do you have?

05:31.434 --> 05:33.819
Just two:

05:33.820 --> 05:36.304
everyday and dress.

05:36.305 --> 05:37.972
Uh-huh.

05:37.973 --> 05:41.142
Listen, we need
to talk about something.

05:41.143 --> 05:43.278
Oh, my God, you're breaking up
with me!

05:44.080 --> 05:45.547
Why would you take me out
shopping

05:45.548 --> 05:47.983
and then break up with me?
That is so cruel!

05:47.984 --> 05:50.886
Leonard, I'm not breaking up
with you.

05:50.887 --> 05:52.838
Oh, okay.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.677
So, what's up?

05:58.678 --> 06:00.996
It's a little weird,

06:00.997 --> 06:04.165
your ex-girlfriend hanging out
here all the time.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.267
I know.

06:05.268 --> 06:06.835
I usually never see
my ex-girlfriends,

06:06.836 --> 06:09.271
unless their hard drives crash.

06:09.272 --> 06:13.742
I'm just saying, how would you
feel if I was hanging out

06:13.743 --> 06:15.110
with my ex-boyfriend?

06:15.111 --> 06:16.545
Um, not great, I guess.

06:16.546 --> 06:18.413
But Penny and I are
just friends.

06:18.414 --> 06:19.781
I don't care.

06:19.782 --> 06:21.650
This is a woman you have
slept with.

06:21.651 --> 06:23.034
If you want her around,

06:23.035 --> 06:26.354
then I have to wonder if maybe
you're not ready to move on.

06:26.355 --> 06:28.073
No, no-no-no, I'm ready!

06:28.074 --> 06:30.592
I gave up the gift of
sight for you.

06:30.593 --> 06:32.227
If that's not moving on,
what is?

06:32.228 --> 06:35.497
You need to cut the cord
with Penny.

06:35.498 --> 06:37.866
Oh... okay.

06:37.867 --> 06:40.201
You don't sound very confident.

06:40.202 --> 06:41.803
No, no, I'm confident.

06:41.804 --> 06:44.239
Its not like I'm unfamiliar with
the "get lost" conversation.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.375
Although, this will be the first
time I'll be the one saying it.

06:47.376 --> 06:49.544
Thank you.

06:49.545 --> 06:50.879
I appreciate it.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.147
Sure.

06:52.148 --> 06:54.616
Oh, God, you
smell so good.

06:54.617 --> 06:56.651
Of course, that
could just be

06:56.652 --> 06:58.570
my other senses
getting stronger.

07:01.624 --> 07:05.627
Hypothetically, if I had access

07:05.628 --> 07:10.232
to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?

07:10.233 --> 07:12.467
Leonard, it is a source
of great pain

07:12.468 --> 07:13.602
to me and my family

07:13.603 --> 07:15.770
that my brother has that outfit
in his wardrobe.

07:15.771 --> 07:17.272
Can we not discuss it?

07:17.273 --> 07:20.041
I'm sorry. Never mind.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.981
And was your card the jack
of diamonds?

07:25.982 --> 07:30.385
Oh, unbelievable!

07:33.656 --> 07:35.056
Know how he did it yet?

07:40.029 --> 07:41.596
Um...

07:41.597 --> 07:44.799
Aw, he has the same look
my little nephew gets

07:44.800 --> 07:47.602
when he can't figure out
how I got his nose.

07:50.907 --> 07:53.208
You know, I have some remedial
magic tricks

07:53.209 --> 07:54.976
that might be more your speed.

07:54.977 --> 07:56.411
Like, ooh, look!

07:57.580 --> 07:59.748
The pencil's rubber!

08:01.250 --> 08:04.219
Hey, I think I know how you did
the card trick.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.589
Oh, please, if I don't know,
you don't know.

08:07.590 --> 08:09.241
That's axiomatic.

08:09.242 --> 08:11.126
Come here.

08:12.261 --> 08:13.962
You're right.

08:15.731 --> 08:17.399
Not too bad for someone

08:17.400 --> 08:19.935
who doesn't know
what "axiomatic" means.

08:27.009 --> 08:28.810
Oh, hi.

08:28.811 --> 08:30.144
Hey, you.

08:30.145 --> 08:31.646
What happened with
the contacts?

08:31.647 --> 08:32.914
One of them's upstairs.

08:32.914 --> 08:36.484
The other one sort of slipped
back into my skull.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.837
Hey, is that one of the new
shirts Priya got you?

08:38.837 --> 08:40.121
Yeah.

08:40.121 --> 08:41.756
You don't wanna
wash that.

08:41.756 --> 08:43.625
No?
No, that's silk.

08:43.626 --> 08:45.844
Seriously, what would you do
without me?

08:45.845 --> 08:47.729
Yeah. (chuckles)

08:49.599 --> 08:51.516
You know, I gotta
tell you, I think

08:51.517 --> 08:54.102
you got a real winner with Priya.
Yeah, me, too.

08:54.103 --> 08:55.470
She seems really sweet.

08:55.471 --> 08:57.639
Believe me, you do not want
to take that for granted.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.408
There are a lot of bitches
out there.

09:00.409 --> 09:04.813
Yeah, bitches are the worst.

09:04.814 --> 09:06.681
All right, I'll
see you later.

09:06.682 --> 09:09.384
Uh, Penny, there's something
I have to tell you.

09:09.385 --> 09:10.518
What?

09:10.519 --> 09:13.288
Okay, uh, how do I put this?

09:13.289 --> 09:17.959
Um... are you familiar with
Darwin's observation

09:17.960 --> 09:21.029
of the finches
in the Galapagos Islands?

09:21.030 --> 09:23.331
Did they make a movie about it?

09:23.332 --> 09:25.033
No.

09:25.034 --> 09:26.968
Then no.

09:26.969 --> 09:30.772
All right, well, anyway, Darwin
observed that when two groups

09:30.773 --> 09:33.174
of finches competed
over the same food source,

09:33.175 --> 09:36.378
eventually one of them would
evolve a different beak shape

09:36.379 --> 09:39.047
so they could feed on
something else.

09:39.048 --> 09:41.650
Okay.

09:41.651 --> 09:44.919
So what do you think we can
learn from that behavior

09:44.920 --> 09:47.355
that we can apply
to our own lives?

09:48.457 --> 09:52.394
Uh, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush?

09:54.196 --> 09:58.033
Sure, that has birds in it.

09:59.402 --> 10:02.704
It's fun talking to you,
Leonard; I always learn stuff.

10:05.841 --> 10:08.576
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna count that.

10:12.648 --> 10:16.051
PRIYA: Do you really have
to wear that in bed?

10:19.155 --> 10:22.490
Yeah. The doctor didn't want me
to rub my eye during the night.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.027
It was either this or one
of those giant neck cones.

10:26.028 --> 10:30.432
So did you get
to talk to Penny?

10:30.433 --> 10:34.135
Oh, yes.
Indeed, I did.

10:34.136 --> 10:35.837
And?

10:35.838 --> 10:38.640
She completely understood
everything I said. Case closed.

10:38.641 --> 10:40.275
Was she upset?

10:40.276 --> 10:43.578
Maybe, but that's
not my problem.

10:43.579 --> 10:45.547
She's not my girlfriend,
you are.

10:45.548 --> 10:48.550
I hope you weren't
cruel to her.

10:48.551 --> 10:52.954
Is the autumn cruel
for letting the flowers die,

10:52.955 --> 10:55.857
or is that just nature's way?

10:57.727 --> 10:58.993
(knocking)

10:58.994 --> 11:00.829
SHELDON: Leonard?
(knocking) Leonard?

11:00.830 --> 11:01.963
Leonard?

11:01.964 --> 11:03.465
What?!

11:03.466 --> 11:06.201
I think I figured out
Wolowitz's magic trick,

11:06.202 --> 11:09.370
and I need you
to pick a card.

11:10.906 --> 11:13.908
I am not opening
that door, Sheldon!

11:13.909 --> 11:15.243
As you wish.

11:20.349 --> 11:24.886
Pick a card, put it back,
and prepare to be amazed.

11:26.889 --> 11:28.890
Did you pick one?

11:28.891 --> 11:30.325
Yep.

11:32.828 --> 11:35.330
Is this your card?

11:35.331 --> 11:36.598
Nope.

11:36.599 --> 11:38.800
Drat.

11:39.935 --> 11:42.270
Is this your card?

11:42.271 --> 11:44.439
No.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.508
I'll be right back.

11:54.268 --> 11:55.668
Pick a card, Sheldon.

11:57.271 --> 12:01.107
Now look at it,
and put it back in the deck.

12:03.144 --> 12:04.677
Now do you remember your card?

12:04.678 --> 12:06.780
Of course I do, I have
an eidetic memory.

12:06.781 --> 12:08.548
My apologies.

12:08.549 --> 12:11.017
Now shuffle the cards.

12:11.018 --> 12:13.520
Shuffling.

12:13.521 --> 12:15.255
Wait here.

12:17.642 --> 12:20.727
Processing image,
cross-referencing...

12:20.728 --> 12:22.495
Whatcha doin'?

12:22.496 --> 12:25.532
I'm reverse engineering
Wolowitz's magic trick.

12:25.533 --> 12:29.636
What's up
with the infrared cameras?

12:29.637 --> 12:32.138
I'm measuring residual heat
levels on the playing cards

12:32.139 --> 12:33.740
to determine
which one's been touched.

12:33.741 --> 12:35.609
By the way,

12:35.610 --> 12:37.010
if you hope to have children,

12:37.011 --> 12:38.879
I suggest you switch
from briefs to boxers.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.780
Your testicles look a tad warm.

12:48.656 --> 12:51.658
Holy crap,
are you connected

12:51.659 --> 12:53.827
to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory?

12:53.828 --> 12:56.396
Yes. I'm using their
Cray supercomputer

12:56.397 --> 12:57.697
to analyze
shuffling patterns.

12:57.698 --> 13:00.634
Sheldon, that computer
is used

13:00.635 --> 13:01.902
for national defense.

13:01.903 --> 13:03.570
Hacking into it is
a federal crime.

13:03.571 --> 13:06.740
Relax, we're not under
attack right now.

13:06.741 --> 13:12.379
Okay, I'm leaving before the
black helicopters get here.

13:13.547 --> 13:17.117
And is this my card?

13:17.118 --> 13:19.552
Rats!

13:22.323 --> 13:25.859
I wonder if Howard used
a radioactive tracer.

13:25.860 --> 13:29.763
Where am I going to find
uranium-235 this time of night?

13:32.767 --> 13:34.968
Come on, CraigsList.

13:39.106 --> 13:42.142
Is it racist that I took you
to an Indian restaurant?

13:42.143 --> 13:45.612
It's okay, I like Indian food.

13:45.613 --> 13:49.082
Or as you probably call it
back home, "food." (chuckles)

13:49.083 --> 13:52.018
Why didn't you wear
your contacts?

13:52.019 --> 13:53.320
Don't you like them?

13:53.321 --> 13:54.587
No, no, I do.

13:54.588 --> 13:56.656
It's just I knew I was having
curry tonight

13:56.657 --> 14:00.193
and I only want one part
of my body to burn at a time.

14:02.029 --> 14:04.164
You know... (clears throat)

14:04.165 --> 14:07.067
...my company offered me a
position here in Los Angeles.

14:07.068 --> 14:11.171
Does that mean you'd relocate
here permanently?

14:11.172 --> 14:13.707
Maybe. What do you think?

14:13.708 --> 14:16.042
I love it.

14:16.043 --> 14:18.011
That's great!
(knocking)

14:18.012 --> 14:21.147
Hi!

14:21.849 --> 14:24.651
Hi! Just hang on.

14:24.652 --> 14:27.787
(chuckles) Small world.

14:27.788 --> 14:28.955
You did talk to her, didn't you?

14:28.956 --> 14:31.558
Of course, I did.
I talked and talked and talked.

14:32.677 --> 14:36.662
Hey! Look at Leonard in his
fancy-ass grownup clothes.

14:38.099 --> 14:40.333
Way to go, Priya.
For once, he doesn't look

14:40.334 --> 14:42.669
like a mannequin in
the boys' department.

14:44.138 --> 14:45.438
(chuckles)
Hey, did he

14:45.439 --> 14:47.207
tell you I saved
the silk shirt?

14:47.208 --> 14:48.575
No, he did not.

14:48.576 --> 14:50.677
He was gonna throw it
in the washing machine

14:50.678 --> 14:53.380
with his
Spiderman underwear.

14:53.381 --> 14:55.148
That's our Lenny, huh?
(laughs)

14:55.149 --> 14:58.118
Yes, that's our Lenny.

14:58.119 --> 15:00.370
So how's
the food here?

15:00.371 --> 15:03.239
Oh, wow, that is
really, really good.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.241
Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys are on a date.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.160
We can hang out
anytime. Have fun.

15:07.161 --> 15:08.495
Bye.
Good night.

15:09.914 --> 15:11.831
Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!

15:14.201 --> 15:16.920
Whoo! It really
sneaks up on ya, huh?

15:16.921 --> 15:18.338
All right, I gotta go.

15:22.743 --> 15:25.779
It is pretty spicy.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.350
Oh, I've been meaning
to tell you,

15:30.351 --> 15:32.619
I figured out
your magic trick.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.421
Really?

15:34.422 --> 15:35.622
Oh, yes.

15:35.623 --> 15:38.091
In fact, I improved upon it.

15:38.692 --> 15:40.060
I'd love to see that.

15:40.061 --> 15:41.327
How about you, Raj?

15:41.328 --> 15:43.163
Beefaroni <i>and</i> a show?

15:43.164 --> 15:44.864
How do you turn that down?

15:44.865 --> 15:49.736
All right. (clears throat)

15:49.737 --> 15:51.404
Pick a card.

15:51.405 --> 15:53.673
Okay.

15:54.742 --> 15:56.242
Bippity-boppity-boo.

15:56.243 --> 15:57.544
(beeps)

16:05.619 --> 16:08.955
What's with the wand
and the beep?

16:08.956 --> 16:10.723
The wand is called showmanship,

16:10.724 --> 16:13.093
and the beep is none
of your business.

16:14.261 --> 16:15.261
(text alert tone sounds)

16:15.262 --> 16:16.329
Oh! Excuse me.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.864
I'm getting a text message

16:17.865 --> 16:20.433
completely unrelated
to this magic trick.

16:20.434 --> 16:24.037
Oh, look, my
dry cleaning's ready.

16:24.038 --> 16:27.941
And your card was
the five of spades. Ta-da.

16:27.942 --> 16:31.711
These cards have barcodes
on them.

16:31.712 --> 16:32.778
The wand is a reader.

16:32.779 --> 16:34.781
It's transmitting to your phone.

16:38.452 --> 16:40.553
I said, "ta-da."

16:40.554 --> 16:41.621
Show's over.

16:41.622 --> 16:43.923
That's pathetic.

16:43.924 --> 16:46.626
Let me show you how
a real magician does it.

16:46.627 --> 16:47.960
Raj, take a card.

16:47.961 --> 16:49.829
Don't let me see it.

16:49.830 --> 16:52.165
Okay.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.666
Three of clubs.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.068
Son of a gun,

16:55.069 --> 16:56.603
you're blowing my mind!

16:59.707 --> 17:02.308
Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

17:04.278 --> 17:07.280
That does it.
I'm getting uranium.

17:12.086 --> 17:13.486
You ever gonna tell him?

17:13.487 --> 17:16.656
Maybe.
When it stops being fun.

17:16.656 --> 17:19.142
So never.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.801
Oh, hey, I was
just on my way to work.

17:28.802 --> 17:30.270
Oh, okay,
its not important.

17:30.271 --> 17:31.237
It can wait.

17:31.238 --> 17:32.856
No, it's all right.
Walk me down.

17:32.857 --> 17:33.857
So, what's up?

17:33.858 --> 17:35.542
Uh, I kind of have
a problem

17:35.543 --> 17:37.544
I was hoping
you could help me with.

17:37.545 --> 17:38.611
Sure, anything.

17:38.612 --> 17:41.114
Move out.

17:41.115 --> 17:42.482
What?

17:42.483 --> 17:43.816
Not far.

17:43.817 --> 17:45.885
Hey, if you ever wanna
start a family,

17:45.886 --> 17:47.737
La Cañada has
some great schools.

17:47.738 --> 17:49.155
Okay, I'm not
moving anywhere.

17:49.156 --> 17:51.291
What the hell
is this all about?

17:51.292 --> 17:53.860
Why does it have
to be about anything?

17:53.861 --> 17:55.962
Can't a fella ask
his buddy to relocate,

17:55.963 --> 17:58.064
no questions asked?

17:58.065 --> 17:59.465
Oh, for God's sake,
Leonard,

17:59.466 --> 18:00.967
this is about Priya,
isn't it?

18:00.968 --> 18:02.702
She doesn't want me
hanging out with you.

18:02.703 --> 18:05.872
Yes. There, I said it.

18:07.074 --> 18:08.675
Okay, look.

18:08.676 --> 18:10.843
I happen to like
your girlfriend.

18:10.844 --> 18:11.761
And she likes you.

18:11.762 --> 18:12.412
No, she doesn't.

18:12.413 --> 18:14.147
Not really, no.

18:14.148 --> 18:16.082
It doesn't matter.
Look, I promise from now on

18:16.083 --> 18:17.550
I will keep
my distance from you.

18:17.551 --> 18:19.953
Well, now, hold on.
What kind of distance

18:19.954 --> 18:21.888
are we talking about?
Because we are neighbors.

18:21.889 --> 18:24.190
I mean, I can hear the toilet
flush in your apartment.

18:24.191 --> 18:26.826
You can hear my toilet flush?

18:26.827 --> 18:29.395
I don't listen for it,
but it's nice to know

18:29.396 --> 18:32.966
everything's okay
with your plumbing.

18:32.967 --> 18:34.834
The building's plumbing.

18:34.835 --> 18:36.035
Leonard, I get it.

18:36.036 --> 18:37.503
You're in
a new relationship now.

18:37.504 --> 18:38.738
And I'm happy for you.

18:38.739 --> 18:41.207
So why don't we just shake
hands and part friends?

18:41.208 --> 18:42.408
Well, now hold on.

18:42.409 --> 18:43.643
How about this?

18:43.644 --> 18:46.846
How about we still hang out,
but on the down-low?

18:46.847 --> 18:50.383
Are you really that kind of guy?

18:50.384 --> 18:52.051
No.

18:52.052 --> 18:56.256
I actually felt kinda silly just
saying "on the down-low."

18:58.025 --> 18:59.809
Good-bye, Leonard.

19:01.829 --> 19:04.397
Penny, wait.

19:05.232 --> 19:07.900
Ah!

19:11.438 --> 19:13.673
Damn contacts.

19:19.675 --> 19:20.825
Incoming.

19:22.424 --> 19:24.809
- Hi!
- Hey!

19:24.829 --> 19:26.079
Hello.

19:26.978 --> 19:29.881
Why so glum, chum?

19:29.925 --> 19:31.926
Apparently,
you can't hack into

19:31.927 --> 19:33.895
a government
supercomputer

19:33.896 --> 19:35.496
and then try
to buy uranium

19:35.497 --> 19:37.632
without the Department of
Homeland Security tattling

19:37.633 --> 19:39.800
to your mother.

19:44.340 --> 19:45.673
Oh, that's too bad.

19:45.674 --> 19:47.242
Figure out the magic trick yet?

19:47.243 --> 19:49.544
(mocking):
Figure out the magic trick yet?

19:49.545 --> 19:51.779
Want me to tell you
how to do it?

19:51.780 --> 19:52.614
No.

19:52.615 --> 19:54.349
I'll show you one more time.

19:54.350 --> 19:55.950
Raj?

19:55.951 --> 19:57.652
Hang on.

19:57.653 --> 19:59.587
This time do it with me,

19:59.588 --> 20:02.890
so I can make sure
there's no monkey business.

20:04.710 --> 20:07.863
All right.
