WEBVTT

00:18.186 --> 00:22.057
* I wanted out again

00:22.090 --> 00:25.727
* Wanted you, so fun

00:25.761 --> 00:27.162
* But I did...

00:27.195 --> 00:28.497
So you remember Jimmy,

00:28.530 --> 00:30.198
right?
Oh, my God. Gretchen.

00:30.232 --> 00:32.701
Tough titties,
it's a free country.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.903
Anyway, I have to have this
really sucky conversation

00:34.936 --> 00:36.872
with him and I don't
want to at all.

00:36.905 --> 00:38.407
Your appointment
isn't until next week.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.242
You cannot just show up places.
Well then,

00:40.276 --> 00:42.844
stop Foursquaring yourself
every time you leave the house,

00:42.878 --> 00:45.281
like the Mayor of
Thirsty Town. Also,

00:45.314 --> 00:47.616
stop using Foursquare
like the Mayor of 2011.

00:47.649 --> 00:50.185
Okay. So you need something
from Jimmy.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.721
Yeah. I need his dad
to have seen a cardiologist.

00:52.754 --> 00:53.722
Ha-ha, snap.

00:53.755 --> 00:55.891
He died?

00:55.924 --> 00:57.192
I'm so sorry. When?
Okay.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.294
So here's the part where

00:58.327 --> 00:59.861
you feel like total dog shit.

00:59.895 --> 01:02.130
Remember you made me
open my mail?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.899
Well I did.
And boom.

01:03.932 --> 01:06.234
There's his dad's obit.
And I'm like,

01:06.268 --> 01:08.904
"Well, shit!
How am I supposed to tell him?"

01:08.937 --> 01:11.139
So how am I supposed
to tell him?

01:11.172 --> 01:14.376
You haven't told him?
No! Ew!
I couldn't!

01:14.410 --> 01:17.212
He was so stoked
about selling his book.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.715
And then I got busy and forgot
for a couple days.

01:19.748 --> 01:21.417
But then, I was gonna tell him,

01:21.450 --> 01:24.920
and I got preoccupied by this
iguana on Instagram

01:24.953 --> 01:27.789
(chuckling):
who is just so over it.

01:29.257 --> 01:32.060
It's gonna suck so bad.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.462
I get it. It's tough.

01:33.495 --> 01:35.631
The idea of seeing
Jimmy in pain...

01:35.664 --> 01:38.767
Jimmy?
No, this is gonna suck for me.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.001
We've been having
hella fun lately.

01:40.035 --> 01:41.970
Boning like crazy.

01:42.003 --> 01:43.672
(chuckles) I tricked him
into giving me backrubs,

01:43.705 --> 01:45.341
saying that it made me horny.

01:45.374 --> 01:47.943
Jokes on you, dummy.
I'm horny already.

01:47.976 --> 01:51.079
Here's an idea: what if
I just never tell him?
I-I don't like

01:51.112 --> 01:53.515
to tell my patients what to do,
but Jesus Christ, you have to

01:53.549 --> 01:56.585
tell Jimmy his father died.
What if he cries,

01:56.618 --> 01:58.620
and I see
the sad little boy inside?

01:58.654 --> 02:00.288
I don't want to tell him.

02:00.322 --> 02:01.523
I know. And I've met Jimmy--

02:01.557 --> 02:04.493
that sounds disgusting--
but you have to.

02:05.527 --> 02:07.128
(sighs)

02:07.162 --> 02:09.030
Fine.

02:09.064 --> 02:11.900
I suppose you want me
to pay you now.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.572
Ugh, you owe me a five spot.

02:17.639 --> 02:20.175
*

02:25.146 --> 02:27.883
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:27.916 --> 02:30.686
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:30.719 --> 02:34.022
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:37.859 --> 02:39.895
Right. Remember,

02:39.928 --> 02:42.631
the look we're going
for is jocund but...

02:42.664 --> 02:43.999
profoundly tormented.
Okay?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.468
Uh, what's going on, Jimbo?

02:46.502 --> 02:49.204
Jacket photo. It's a bit early.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.572
But I'm planning on
going full D'Onofrio

02:50.606 --> 02:52.040
once the advance
money comes in.

02:52.073 --> 02:54.242
Can you take a little break?

02:54.275 --> 02:57.379
God, no, woman!
There's too much to do.

02:57.413 --> 02:59.681
Now that the starting gun on
the Grand Prix has sounded,

02:59.715 --> 03:02.317
the instant that I take my foot
off the proverbial gas

03:02.350 --> 03:04.986
to celebrate, shall materialize
five other writers

03:05.020 --> 03:06.988
in my side mirror
just ready to pass me

03:07.022 --> 03:08.990
on the Autobahn that is
the publishing industry...

03:09.024 --> 03:12.394
to clumsily mix European
race car metaphors.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.095
As a veteran
writer girlfriend now,

03:14.129 --> 03:15.330
you know that the work

03:15.363 --> 03:17.232
is never-ending.
But you spent the last

03:17.265 --> 03:18.900
few months drinking
and jerking it

03:18.934 --> 03:19.901
to the Lane Bryant
shoe catalog.

03:19.935 --> 03:23.071
If I have to explain this
one more time:

03:23.104 --> 03:25.407
it's all writing.

03:25.441 --> 03:27.743
Um, I'll be quick.
(groans)

03:27.776 --> 03:30.345
Listen, Jimmy...

03:30.378 --> 03:31.613
No, I'm sorry. Look,

03:31.647 --> 03:33.849
this is gonna be a
very long, arduous--

03:33.882 --> 03:36.518
yet certainly rewarding--
journey for you,

03:36.552 --> 03:39.020
at my side, so before
the madness begins,

03:39.054 --> 03:41.657
as a pre-ward, I want to take
you on a restorative trip.

03:43.091 --> 03:44.793
Like a cruise?

03:44.826 --> 03:46.862
Can we go on a cruise?

03:46.895 --> 03:49.197
Um...
That's my dream vacation!

03:49.230 --> 03:51.933
My parents always thought
it was tacky.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.369
Okay. Well, if your
idea of paradise

03:54.402 --> 03:56.938
is succumbing to Norovirus
on a floating red state,

03:56.972 --> 03:58.474
then sure!

03:58.507 --> 03:59.641
(screams)

03:59.675 --> 04:01.276
(laughs)
There-there's

04:01.309 --> 04:03.612
a water slide
and-and a musical revue

04:03.645 --> 04:06.314
and if the grown-ups
are busy gambling,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.383
you hang out with
the other kids and just color!

04:08.416 --> 04:11.252
Okay, I need to get back to my
shoot. I have a liquid brunch

04:11.286 --> 04:13.722
with my editor, so we can
plan marketing strategies.

04:13.755 --> 04:15.423
Sounds fun!

04:15.457 --> 04:16.825
Gretchen.

04:16.858 --> 04:19.293
Every mimosa
is a chore.

04:19.327 --> 04:22.898
Okay? Every sip is a brick
in a literary wall

04:22.931 --> 04:25.333
that I'm painting...
Got it.
Yay! Cruise!

04:25.366 --> 04:27.836
Okay, back to work.
Props.

04:27.869 --> 04:29.871
*

04:40.682 --> 04:42.618
Ooh, you hungry?

04:42.651 --> 04:44.486
I could eat.

04:47.956 --> 04:51.527
P.A.: May I help you?
BOTH:
We're with the network.

04:52.561 --> 04:53.862
So, how's your gimpy husband?

04:53.895 --> 04:56.131
Poor Paul.
He's off the couch,

04:56.164 --> 04:58.934
but his wound keeps getting
reinfected somehow.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.368
I poked around there

05:00.401 --> 05:03.138
with my fingers,
and couldn't find anything.

05:03.171 --> 05:05.473
I feel guilty because
of how much he suffered.

05:05.507 --> 05:07.375
And because you
stabbed him on purpose.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.545
I didn't want to kill him,
I just snapped.

05:11.346 --> 05:13.481
Oops...
I knew it.

05:13.515 --> 05:16.284
Lindser! Oh, my God,
I thought I was scared of you

05:16.317 --> 05:18.119
that time you yelled
at that cop in Tijuana.

05:18.153 --> 05:20.722
You should be scared.

05:20.756 --> 05:22.858
And it was so easy.

05:22.891 --> 05:25.160
I was just like...

05:26.261 --> 05:27.495
Poking some cheese.

05:29.064 --> 05:30.532
Poking some cheese?

05:30.566 --> 05:33.201
It's spooky. Afterwards,

05:33.234 --> 05:35.303
I kept telling myself
I didn't do it,

05:35.336 --> 05:37.138
until I actually
believed it.

05:37.172 --> 05:39.240
Like how Oprah can
eat bread now.

05:39.274 --> 05:40.542
You don't love Paul.

05:40.576 --> 05:44.079
That was true for Old Lindsay.

05:44.112 --> 05:47.983
New Lindsay can put
any thought in her brain.

05:48.016 --> 05:50.819
(gasps) Like that upside down
movie with Juno and the dreidel

05:50.852 --> 05:52.921
and Tom Hardy
with the tight pants.
(groans)

05:52.954 --> 05:55.156
If I can incept

05:55.190 --> 05:58.594
myself I didn't stab Paul...

05:58.627 --> 06:01.763
maybe I can incept myself
into loving him.

06:01.797 --> 06:04.933
How are things
with the Jim-dogs?

06:04.966 --> 06:08.536
Oh, suck-balls.
His pops croaked.
Yawn.

06:08.570 --> 06:12.040
So what's the probs?
I haven't told him yet.

06:12.073 --> 06:14.743
And now my therapist
is making me.
You can't tell him, Gretch!

06:14.776 --> 06:18.279
The second those words
come out of your mouth,

06:18.313 --> 06:20.015
you are no longer
Jimmy's fun sex hole.

06:20.048 --> 06:21.850
You're the guys
at the beginning

06:21.883 --> 06:24.586
of Saving Private Ryan who
make the moms fall down.

06:24.620 --> 06:25.954
You're right!

06:25.987 --> 06:27.555
That titty-sucking bitch
is trying to

06:27.589 --> 06:30.058
straight "Lemonade"
my relationship.

06:30.091 --> 06:32.594
What do I do?
Get some

06:32.628 --> 06:34.763
other sucker to tell him.

06:34.796 --> 06:37.866
(excited chatter in distance)
Colby! Travis!

06:37.899 --> 06:40.969
You two know
the policy on roughhousing.

06:41.002 --> 06:44.139
I don't care if
you are best friends.

06:44.172 --> 06:46.407
Ten more minutes
and I'm coming in there!

06:48.243 --> 06:50.578
As I was saying,
we've got a killer special.

06:50.612 --> 06:54.149
$49 for three yoga sessions,
or three Pilates sessions.

06:54.182 --> 06:56.451
We also have a
cutting-edge new lineup

06:56.484 --> 06:59.254
of the hottest new hybrid
workouts. Piloxing:

06:59.287 --> 07:01.923
Pilates and boxing, yogitsu:

07:01.957 --> 07:03.458
yoga and jujitsu,

07:03.491 --> 07:05.927
spowing: spinning
and rowing,

07:05.961 --> 07:08.063
Zustified: that's
Zumba while you

07:08.096 --> 07:10.565
binge-watch Justified,
it's actually not really...
Edgar, shut up.

07:10.598 --> 07:14.770
We need to tell you a secret.
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I don't want any secrets.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.639
You love secrets.

07:17.673 --> 07:20.175
Secrets are your favorite thing.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.077
No, this is a really
bad time, okay?

07:22.110 --> 07:24.112
I've been stuck with processing
some events, like the time

07:24.145 --> 07:25.781
we got pinned down
outside of Tikrit

07:25.814 --> 07:28.850
and we had to improvise body
armor with tank shrapnel.

07:28.884 --> 07:31.753
That's not so bad.
Or like the time I was
so thirsty I shot a camel.

07:31.787 --> 07:32.854
'Cause the humps
have water in them?
Because you thought there was

07:32.888 --> 07:34.756
water in the humps?
Yeah.

07:34.790 --> 07:37.693
Turns out they don't work
like that. Anyway, seriously,

07:37.726 --> 07:40.528
I-I don't have any room in my
head for any more dark...

07:40.561 --> 07:43.098
Jimmy's dad died
and he doesn't know.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.165
Jimmy's dad what?

07:45.133 --> 07:47.302
Oh, God.

07:47.335 --> 07:50.672
Poor Ronny, poor
Jimmy, poor camel.

07:50.706 --> 07:51.973
Poor Bing Bong.

07:52.007 --> 07:53.842
Everything's bad,
you guys.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.276
Everything's really, really bad.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.045
So you'll tell him, yeah?
Thanks.
No,

07:57.078 --> 07:58.379
no, no way! I...

07:58.413 --> 07:59.848
I told
enough people

07:59.881 --> 08:01.717
that someone
that they love died.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.618
(gasps)
I have an idea.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.888
When my parents got divorced,
they told us at Benihana's

08:06.922 --> 08:08.289
so we wouldn't cause a scene.

08:08.323 --> 08:10.125
The chef put a shrimp
in his hat.

08:10.158 --> 08:12.794
How'd that work?
He just put a shrimp
in his hat.

08:12.828 --> 08:15.163
No, I mean,
telling you in public.

08:15.196 --> 08:18.499
Oh. It totally made us
not freak out as much.

08:18.533 --> 08:21.402
Except later, I drank my mom's
mai tai and climbed on the table

08:21.436 --> 08:22.871
'cause I forgot it was a grill.

08:22.904 --> 08:24.339
That's why I don't have
footprints.

08:24.372 --> 08:25.306
(slurping)

08:25.340 --> 08:26.742
GRETCHEN:
Okay.

08:26.775 --> 08:29.344
So, maybe I invite
a bunch of people over,

08:29.377 --> 08:31.079
and then everyone
tells him together.

08:31.112 --> 08:33.148
And then he associates
the sadness

08:33.181 --> 08:34.850
with you jerks,
and not with me.

08:34.883 --> 08:36.583
That suddenly
sounds bad for us.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.086
I got to go, you guys.

08:38.119 --> 08:40.655
I'm late teaching
Treadsparent.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.058
It's running on a treadmill
while you watch...

08:43.091 --> 08:45.093
We get it.

08:54.569 --> 08:56.604
(grunting)

08:58.740 --> 09:01.376
These hand crutches
were all Lindsay could find

09:01.409 --> 09:03.111
at the medical supply.

09:03.144 --> 09:04.746
I don't like that place.

09:04.780 --> 09:06.214
So many weird toilets.

09:06.247 --> 09:07.682
Mmm.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.785
I love sneaking an extra
dessert, don't you?

09:09.818 --> 09:11.887
One's for me,
one's for my baby.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.956
I'm not giving
my dessert to your baby.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.025
Oh, right,
you meant my baby.

09:17.058 --> 09:18.226
That's right,
I'm still pregnant.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.128
Check it out.

09:20.161 --> 09:22.063
Looks like a normal vest
with a ton of pockets, right?

09:22.097 --> 09:23.664
Wrong.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.234
Harmonica vest.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.236
Ever since I Venmo'd
a year's salary

09:28.269 --> 09:29.704
to some chick in the Ukraine,

09:29.737 --> 09:32.507
I can only have hobbies
that cost less than $25.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.477
Hell yeah!

09:37.779 --> 09:38.980
GRETCHEN:
Hey, everybody.

09:39.014 --> 09:40.615
Uh, thank you so much

09:40.648 --> 09:43.651
for coming to Jimmy's
surprise/congratulations-

09:43.684 --> 09:45.153
you-sold-the-book party.

09:45.186 --> 09:47.422
Um, small change
of plans, though.

09:47.455 --> 09:49.757
Jimmy's dad passed away.

09:49.791 --> 09:52.160
(all gasp)

09:52.193 --> 09:53.728
What a major tradge, but...

09:53.761 --> 09:56.297
happens every day
on my operating table.

09:56.331 --> 09:59.134
Someone dies every day
on your operating table?

09:59.167 --> 10:01.837
Not literally every day, dummy.
On average.

10:01.870 --> 10:02.971
Our condolences, Gretchen.

10:03.004 --> 10:05.073
We should let you two
grieve in private.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.241
GRETCHEN:
Oh, no, no, no, no!

10:06.274 --> 10:07.442
Stay.

10:07.475 --> 10:08.944
Um, in fact...

10:08.977 --> 10:11.579
Wait, crazy idea.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.248
Um, why don't
we tell him together?

10:13.281 --> 10:15.616
He doesn't know?

10:15.650 --> 10:16.852
Well, it happened in England.

10:16.885 --> 10:18.586
And there's
a time difference, so...

10:18.619 --> 10:21.322
Yeah, uh, so,
when he comes home,

10:21.356 --> 10:23.825
I'll give the signal,
you guys drop the bomb,

10:23.859 --> 10:25.493
and boom--
it's your fault.

10:25.526 --> 10:27.028
Thanks so much
for doing this.

10:27.062 --> 10:28.496
Eat cheese, have fun.

10:30.165 --> 10:31.166
(harmonica playing)

10:31.199 --> 10:33.701
Can you imagine?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.937
He was almost
my father-in-law.

10:35.971 --> 10:38.940
Of course, I'm much closer to
the whole thing now that I'm

10:38.974 --> 10:41.276
going to have a daughter.

10:41.309 --> 10:43.778
That's right.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.946
We're having a girl.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.047
Aah!

10:46.081 --> 10:47.315
Isn't that amazing?

10:47.348 --> 10:49.350
Can't you just die
how cute

10:49.384 --> 10:50.785
we're gonna be together?
Mm.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.853
Of course, it's such a shame

10:51.887 --> 10:53.521
that our gender-reveal party

10:53.554 --> 10:55.523
was spoiled when
those North Korean hackers

10:55.556 --> 10:56.958
stole Vernon's identity.

10:56.992 --> 11:00.328
Becca, we all know
Vernon was a money-slave.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.163
What?
No, no, no.

11:02.197 --> 11:04.399
No, that was just
a story he told,

11:04.432 --> 11:06.201
because he was
embarrassed.

11:06.234 --> 11:07.835
Bad passwords.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.204
Poor Jimmy.

11:09.237 --> 11:10.305
I lost my dad, too.

11:10.338 --> 11:11.839
Your dad died?
No.

11:11.873 --> 11:13.541
I just lost him.

11:13.574 --> 11:15.810
Last week, we were
at the Beverly Center and

11:15.843 --> 11:18.679
he told me to go look at puppies
while he went to Sunglass Hut.

11:18.713 --> 11:21.216
I think we both knew
what was about to happen.

11:21.249 --> 11:23.351
Oh, no.
So, I've been

11:23.384 --> 11:25.253
living alone,
sleeping in his bed.

11:25.286 --> 11:28.089
I'm not ready
to be an adult.

11:28.123 --> 11:32.393
Contemplate the sundry ways
a society handles its elderly

11:32.427 --> 11:34.095
and infirm.
For instance,

11:34.129 --> 11:35.830
the noble Eskimo
sets himself adrift

11:35.863 --> 11:37.832
on an iceberg.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.767
Mm, he's
so smart.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.404
You love this smart,
smart man.

11:43.438 --> 11:45.941
You love his jiggly body

11:45.974 --> 11:47.742
and square face.

11:47.775 --> 11:48.843
You really do.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.877
GRETCHEN:
He's here!

11:49.911 --> 11:51.546
Get ready.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.619
Gretchen, that brunch
was a nightmare.

11:58.653 --> 12:00.455
The publisher just
kept telling me,

12:00.488 --> 12:02.057
"When I write the book..."

12:02.090 --> 12:04.725
Plus the "bottomless"
in "bottomless mimosas"

12:04.759 --> 12:07.195
means nothing
if the waitress disappears

12:07.228 --> 12:08.529
for ten minutes at a time.

12:08.563 --> 12:09.897
Jimmy, look who's here.

12:09.931 --> 12:11.532
Huh.

12:11.566 --> 12:12.867
You invited people over.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.868
Is it Oscar night?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.303
Well, keep it down.

12:15.336 --> 12:17.438
I, of course, must handcuff
myself to my laptop

12:17.472 --> 12:18.739
until my book is written.

12:18.773 --> 12:20.475
Good-bye, all.
See you in the spring.

12:20.508 --> 12:22.277
Wait, Jimmy, uh...

12:22.310 --> 12:23.311
Just stay a moment.

12:23.344 --> 12:25.346
Um, everyone's here for you.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.417
You're here to
celebrate my book sale.

12:29.450 --> 12:31.419
Well, it would be
positively unsporting

12:31.452 --> 12:33.221
of me to deny you
the pleasure

12:33.254 --> 12:34.889
of basking in my success,
even though

12:34.922 --> 12:36.324
nothing good
happened to you.

12:36.357 --> 12:39.794
I never understood
that impulse, really.

12:39.827 --> 12:43.264
Though we do tend to
gather around a fire.

12:43.298 --> 12:45.466
No, Jimmy,
you don't understand, um--

12:45.500 --> 12:47.335
Hey, everybody, could we, um...
And, Gretchen,

12:47.368 --> 12:48.603
my partner in crime,

12:48.636 --> 12:50.138
the diminutive,
mole-lipped

12:50.171 --> 12:53.141
Lillian Hellman to
my Dashiell Hammett.

12:53.174 --> 12:55.810
You have been
so supportive.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.479
No problem. Uh, the people would
like to tell you something.

12:58.513 --> 13:00.081
So, I was gonna
surprise you.

13:00.115 --> 13:02.450
But I did some research.

13:02.483 --> 13:03.818
And I think
I found the perfect

13:03.851 --> 13:04.952
cruise for you.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.321
It's called

13:06.354 --> 13:09.624
"The Famous Pets of
Instagram Cruise."

13:11.959 --> 13:13.428
What?!

13:13.461 --> 13:15.596
Sombrero Iguana?

13:15.630 --> 13:16.697
(sobbing)

13:16.731 --> 13:18.799
Bus Stop Goat!

13:18.833 --> 13:21.269
Cookie Pig!

13:21.302 --> 13:24.639
They're all gonna
be there for me?

13:24.672 --> 13:26.474
EDGAR:
When are we delivering

13:26.507 --> 13:27.542
the package,
you know?

13:27.575 --> 13:29.210
The top secret intel?
Shut up.

13:29.244 --> 13:31.146
(whispers):
After he buys the tickets.

13:31.179 --> 13:34.782
This is the greatest day
of my life!

13:34.815 --> 13:37.318
I am gonna meet Grumpy Cat!

13:37.352 --> 13:39.620
I sold my book!

13:39.654 --> 13:42.023
We're gonna live forever!

13:42.057 --> 13:44.492
*

14:15.390 --> 14:18.193
Lindsay, I got champagne

14:18.226 --> 14:20.395
in my wound.

14:20.428 --> 14:21.929
The bubbles, they sting!

14:21.962 --> 14:24.499
You have to flush it for me.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.901
Okay, Bear,
let's go to the sink.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.336
It hurts so bad!

14:28.369 --> 14:29.670
Does it smell funny?

14:29.704 --> 14:31.206
If it smells like eggs,

14:31.239 --> 14:33.040
you have to take me
back to urgent care!

14:33.074 --> 14:34.742
You love him.
You love him.

14:34.775 --> 14:36.411
Want to get stupid?

14:36.444 --> 14:39.447
How can you party like this
when you know someone died?

14:39.480 --> 14:41.716
I work at a hospital, dude.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.884
Just 'cause a busload
of dead kids rolled up,

14:43.918 --> 14:46.053
doesn't make it
not Margarita Monday.

14:46.087 --> 14:49.224
*

15:08.008 --> 15:09.977
*

15:37.638 --> 15:39.374
(indistinct chatter)

15:43.010 --> 15:45.246
Congratulations, Jimmy.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.849
It is really great
to see you so happy.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.551
Mm.

15:54.689 --> 15:58.359
You have always been
a success in my book.

15:58.393 --> 16:00.395
Oh.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.832
(singsongy):
Okay.

16:04.865 --> 16:06.967
I picked out an ocean suite

16:07.001 --> 16:09.537
with a porthole
so we can smoke and

16:09.570 --> 16:11.005
I added a meet and greet
with Sarcastic Llama.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.640
They take Apple Pay.

16:12.673 --> 16:14.575
You just have to put
your thumb on the thing.

16:18.179 --> 16:20.215
They don't want me
to succeed.

16:20.248 --> 16:21.482
Oh, no,

16:21.516 --> 16:22.683
Jimmy, before you turn,

16:22.717 --> 16:24.219
can you just put your
thumb on the thing?!

16:24.252 --> 16:25.286
Look at them.
No!

16:25.320 --> 16:26.887
JIMMY:
Sirens

16:26.921 --> 16:28.523
singing, "Come
play with us."

16:28.556 --> 16:30.225
But really

16:30.258 --> 16:32.693
they just want me to pilot
my literary schooner

16:32.727 --> 16:34.962
into the rocks
of do-nothingness.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.130
I invited them!

16:36.163 --> 16:37.532
Exactly!

16:37.565 --> 16:39.166
If you all didn't
want me to fail,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.835
then you would've listened

16:40.868 --> 16:42.970
when I said I have to write!

16:43.003 --> 16:46.140
They're desperately afraid
that I will shine so brightly,

16:46.173 --> 16:47.708
it will illuminate

16:47.742 --> 16:49.076
how dim their lives are

16:49.109 --> 16:50.211
by comparison.

16:50.245 --> 16:51.579
Congratulations, Jimmy.

16:51.612 --> 16:55.216
Unaccepted. This is attempted
criminal derailment.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.718
I don't know what you're
saying, but it sounds jerky.

16:57.752 --> 16:59.186
Yeah, and I'll be sure
to return the favor

16:59.220 --> 17:01.188
and sabotage
your eventual attempt

17:01.222 --> 17:03.358
to do something useful
with your life like

17:03.391 --> 17:05.092
finish your GED

17:05.125 --> 17:06.661
or dance
in your adult tap recital.

17:06.694 --> 17:09.096
It's Afro-funk fusion.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.231
Listen here, buster.

17:10.265 --> 17:11.665
Lindsay is my bride,

17:11.699 --> 17:13.601
she's pregnant
with my offspring,

17:13.634 --> 17:15.703
and she deserves respect!

17:15.736 --> 17:18.406
You love him.

17:18.439 --> 17:20.441
(laughs):
It worked.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.041
Apologize.

17:22.076 --> 17:23.444
I will do you one better.

17:23.478 --> 17:26.113
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get my heckle file.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.848
And after I put you all
in your place,

17:27.882 --> 17:29.183
once and for all,

17:29.216 --> 17:30.418
I'll be free
to get to work,

17:30.451 --> 17:33.954
sans distractions.

17:33.988 --> 17:35.356
Yes.
GRETCHEN:
Okay, everybody.

17:35.390 --> 17:38.058
Clock is ticking.
Let's rip off the Band-Aid.

17:38.092 --> 17:40.795
Mm, we're going home.
Vernon?

17:40.828 --> 17:42.363
But I want to get heckled.

17:42.397 --> 17:43.964
Fine, you can Uber home.

17:43.998 --> 17:46.867
But only
the cheap carpool one.

17:46.901 --> 17:48.269
I can't wait
to see him cry.

17:48.303 --> 17:49.870
(British accent):
Oh, no, me Da.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.071
Go tell him, Gretchen!

17:51.105 --> 17:52.206
No, Edgar's
gonna do it.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.708
Remember?

17:53.741 --> 17:54.909
I-I can't.

17:54.942 --> 17:56.043
Just do it!

17:56.076 --> 17:57.278
I'm dealing
with some major shit.

17:58.913 --> 18:02.750
Delivering tragic news
is a kind of service.

18:02.783 --> 18:04.819
To sacrifice
your own comfort

18:04.852 --> 18:07.388
so they can have
the gift of truth?

18:07.422 --> 18:09.223
That is true nobility.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.459
Like when I was born dead,

18:11.492 --> 18:13.628
I vividly remember the pain
in the doctor's voice

18:13.661 --> 18:16.997
when he told my parents, "I have
good news and I have bad news.

18:17.031 --> 18:18.633
"The good news--

18:18.666 --> 18:20.435
"it's a boy
and he's hella hung.

18:20.468 --> 18:23.003
Bad news--
dude's dead."

18:24.138 --> 18:25.973
You're right.

18:26.006 --> 18:28.175
Jimmy deserves
to know the truth.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.276
Thank you.
You're a hero.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.745
Now, get down there.

18:30.778 --> 18:33.648
Ooh, and remind him
about the cruise afterwards.

18:33.681 --> 18:35.350
Oh, no, wait.

18:35.383 --> 18:37.184
Maybe it's too early.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.786
Yeah, hold it.

18:38.819 --> 18:40.120
Go!

18:46.894 --> 18:49.063
(chuckles)

18:51.332 --> 18:54.034
More like dim...
(laughs)

18:54.068 --> 18:55.836
Hey, Jimmy.

18:55.870 --> 18:58.105
I'm afraid some of these heckles
are a bit out of date.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.008
"Paul, nice It's Pat cosplay.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.143
"Edgar, I liked you better
when you

19:03.177 --> 19:05.713
"writing and starring in the hit
musical In the Heights.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.214
"Becca,

19:07.247 --> 19:08.883
"heaven must be
missing an angel,

19:08.916 --> 19:11.151
"because an angel
saw your stupid face

19:11.185 --> 19:13.053
and blew its brains out."
(laughs)

19:13.087 --> 19:15.322
That one's evergreen.

19:15.356 --> 19:18.459
Uh, so you know how, uh,
people come into your lives

19:18.493 --> 19:20.995
and, and they touch you?

19:22.229 --> 19:24.532
Is this about you
being molested?

19:24.565 --> 19:26.233
Boo-hoo.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.135
Every neighborhood
had a handsy fishmonger.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.537
No, Jimmy,

19:29.570 --> 19:31.305
it's about your father.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.341
Has Gretchen been
infecting you with her therapy?

19:34.375 --> 19:38.145
See, unlike Gretchen,
my father is a non-entity

19:38.178 --> 19:40.748
in my life.
If this is about anything,

19:40.781 --> 19:43.350
it's about my need
to disprove the notion

19:43.384 --> 19:45.420
that at the core
I'm just shit,

19:45.453 --> 19:48.122
which all started
when I was a kid and--

19:49.857 --> 19:51.492
Oh, my God.

19:51.526 --> 19:53.394
This is about my father.

19:53.428 --> 19:55.430
Yeah, okay, see...
No wonder I can't take

19:55.463 --> 19:57.264
a moment to enjoy my triumph.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.534
I-I wouldn't...
He's my true enemy!

19:59.567 --> 20:03.504
Instead of heckling my friends,
I am gonna call that old twat

20:03.538 --> 20:04.939
and tear him to pieces.
Uh, no, no, J-Jimmy!

20:04.972 --> 20:06.240
Thanks, Edgar.
Do not do that.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.409
This is the first good idea
you've ever had.

20:08.443 --> 20:09.910
Oh, no, Bing Bong!

20:09.944 --> 20:11.446
Bing Bong!

20:11.479 --> 20:13.448
Dad...

20:13.481 --> 20:15.583
Oh, no.
Oh, this is bad.

20:15.616 --> 20:17.084
This is bad.

20:17.117 --> 20:18.285
Is he crying?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.521
It's really snotty
and moany, isn't it?

20:20.555 --> 20:21.589
Bye!

20:21.622 --> 20:23.057
I'm gonna move to Arizona

20:23.090 --> 20:24.559
and sell turquoise jewelry.
No!

20:24.592 --> 20:25.793
He's gonna call his dad!

20:25.826 --> 20:26.794
Wait, wait!
You didn't tell him?!

20:26.827 --> 20:27.962
Not at all.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.229
Holy crap!

20:29.263 --> 20:30.397
We have to stop him.

20:30.431 --> 20:32.199
Or maybe we don't.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.300
Think it through.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.736
One of the trash-bag sisters
picks up.

20:35.770 --> 20:37.071
Confusion,
confusion.

20:37.104 --> 20:38.205
(British accent):
Oy, ya daft fart.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.474
We sent the obit.
Da's dead.

20:39.507 --> 20:41.308
And boom!
A couple of weeks from now,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.544
I have a tan line
shaped like Grumpy Cat,

20:43.578 --> 20:46.814
because she's been sitting
on my lap on the cruise deck...

20:46.847 --> 20:49.484
Gretchen, you don't get
to be in charge anymore!

20:49.517 --> 20:50.618
What?
You can't do that.

20:50.651 --> 20:52.286
My man takes charge.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.890
Everyone who's not currently
on hobble sticks,

20:55.923 --> 20:59.627
go down there and stop him
from calling his dead father!

20:59.660 --> 21:02.329
A ghost picks up the phone,
I'm gonna shit my pants.

21:09.670 --> 21:10.905
EDGAR:
Oh, God.

21:10.938 --> 21:11.906
We're too late.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.140
Shh, what's he saying?

21:13.173 --> 21:15.175
Hey, Ronny,
it's your son.

21:15.209 --> 21:16.276
You're probably at the pub

21:16.310 --> 21:18.345
passed out
in your stool over

21:18.378 --> 21:21.315
a half-eaten scotch
egg in lard sauce,

21:21.348 --> 21:24.051
but I just wanted
to let you know...

21:27.855 --> 21:29.890
I sold a book, Daddy.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.763
(phone beeps)

21:35.796 --> 21:37.832
Good luck.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.713
Thanks for sticking up
for me earlier.

21:52.747 --> 21:54.181
Of course.

21:54.214 --> 21:55.415
That's my job.

21:57.852 --> 21:59.820
I love you.

21:59.854 --> 22:02.389
(laughs)

22:02.422 --> 22:04.224
Ow...

22:04.258 --> 22:06.727
I think my wound
is weeping again.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.669
Hey, dude?

22:14.702 --> 22:17.638
Can I give you my profesh
medical opinion?

22:17.672 --> 22:20.007
Yeah.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.842
You need some help.

22:21.876 --> 22:24.278
I know.

22:28.082 --> 22:30.450
(playing "Taps")

22:45.566 --> 22:47.802
(bottles clank)

22:48.969 --> 22:51.405
("Taps" continues in distance)

22:55.209 --> 22:57.511
Hey, um...
(clears his throat)

22:57.544 --> 22:59.546
Just got off the phone
with my father.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.181
Sure gave it to old Ronny.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.618
First, I jabbed him
about his illiteracy

23:03.651 --> 23:05.786
and then his pulmonary
oxygen absorption rate.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.588
Jimmy, your dad died.

23:07.622 --> 23:09.590
Yeah, when I heckled him
so hard.

23:09.624 --> 23:12.092
This came in the mail.
I'm so sorry!

23:37.351 --> 23:40.154
(quietly):
I'm just gonna...

23:40.187 --> 23:42.422
*

23:48.996 --> 23:51.932
* I'm taking off

23:51.966 --> 23:54.268
* I've closed the door

23:54.301 --> 23:57.104
* As cold as stone

23:57.137 --> 23:59.439
* Can't take no more

23:59.473 --> 24:01.642
* To be alone

24:01.676 --> 24:04.111
* Is where I go

24:04.144 --> 24:06.280
* I choose to walk

24:06.313 --> 24:08.148
* This lonely road

24:08.182 --> 24:11.285
* Change the flow

24:11.318 --> 24:16.290
* 'Cause I need
the space to grow *

24:17.692 --> 24:21.495
* Hope you'll know

24:21.528 --> 24:25.465
* I will find my way back...

24:31.405 --> 24:34.408
