on Eureka...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.497
Our relationship
has been red-flagged.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.747
The DOD. has sent
a relationship auditor
to assess us.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.420
Your personal feelings
are bound to get
in the way.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.543
Your relationship
has not been approved.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.796
Our budding urges are
interfering with our
professional ambitions.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.009
We should
just have sex.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.757
I really want
to get to know
you first.

00:18.894 --> 00:22.978
Senator Wen's recommending a
full pardon for me, so I'll be
eligible for Astraeus.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.852
I hate this.
Me, too.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.853
It's like they're
taunting us.
I know.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.605
Hey, kids.
More Vinspresso?

00:33.742 --> 00:34.731
Definitely.
Definitely.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.449
Uh, on second thought,
I'm cutting you off.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.911
Why can't they schedule
individual times
for our final interviews?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.450
Because Senator Wen
is sadistic.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.040
Hmm.
We don't even know how long
the interviews will last.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.705
Or what kinds
of questions
they'll ask.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.373
Me in a room talking.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.213
Oh, this can't end well.
I'm not exactly a sharer.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.712
Well, lwouldn't
say that.
You, well...

00:53.011 --> 00:55.673
We've passed
the stress test
and the physicals.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.717
I mean, we've proven
we can handle the mission.

What more could they
want to know?

00:59.434 --> 01:00.890
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

01:01.853 --> 01:03.309
Looks like I'm
about to find out.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.269
As you know,
Mr. Donovan, our goal
for the selection process

01:07.401 --> 01:09.983
has been to find the best
of the best in Eureka.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.979
We've narrowed it down
to the most qualified,

01:13.115 --> 01:15.276
so now we're just looking
for the "X" factor.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.450
And you're going
to find it by digging
around in my brain.

of the picture.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.617

What makes you want this
more than the others.

We want to know...

01:28.839 --> 01:29.954
You.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.005
l've beaten
lie detectors before.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.753
The bio-cortex recorder
is not a lie detector,
Mr. Donovan.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.715
It simply creates
a visual representation
of your memories,

01:40.851 --> 01:43.593
without all the filters
that we place on ourselves.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.720

01:50.277 --> 01:52.984
Hey there, stranger.
"Stranger"? We had
dinner last night.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.148
Yeah, but we didn't
have breakfast

01:54.281 --> 01:55.987
which is arguably
the most important
meal of the day.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.949
You have to be
really careful.
What? Oh, why?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.329
Because the relationship
auditor told us we were
going to break up?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.867
We're not
breaking up.
Screw the DOD.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.115
They're sending
a supervisor today
to hear our appeal.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.331
They could be here
any minute.

I said, lots of smart
people at the DOD.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.005
Nice, attractive bunch.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.971
That's, that's
really subtle.
Thanks, I'm trying.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.172
Where are we going?

02:22.434 --> 02:24.220
Well, we're only
six weeks out
for the launch,

02:24.353 --> 02:27.561
so we're putting Astraeus
through the wringer, running
system tests on everything.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.395
HENRY: We're doing
a full diagnostic workup.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.651
First up is
the electromagnetic
shielding.

02:31.777 --> 02:35.019
It was designed to withstand
the atmospheric conditions

02:35.155 --> 02:38.113
and the extreme
surface temperatures
on Titan.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.698
Not to mention every type
of ionizing radiation.

It's not like you're going
to fire a warhead at it
to see if it works, are you?

02:46.792 --> 02:48.623
Unfortunately, no.
Not today.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.868
Today we're just going
to turn it on. Hit it.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.379
Wow. Henry,
that's actually
kind of impressive.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.467
Great work, Henry.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.676
HENRY: Thank you.

uh, lightning.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.938
I thought the DOD.
was sending a supervisor.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.655
They did.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.114
Seems the folks
over there saw fit
to promote me.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.241
I know, it's amazing.

to congratulate me?

03:37.426 --> 03:38.632

you're ready.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.172

see a conflict
of interest here?

to be unbiased.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.221
Of course you are.
Does it hurt?

03:45.600 --> 03:50.094
Of course not.
The bio-cortex recorder
is completely non-invasive.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.061
It simply
records memories

03:52.190 --> 03:53.566
from the events
of your past

03:53.692 --> 03:56.308
and downloads
them to this

Well, what if there's
a part of our history

04:01.032 --> 04:02.772
that, uh, we don't
want to share?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.572
It's based on the same
technology that they're using
for the Astraeus interviews.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.824

our hippocampus.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.457

the things you're
willing to share,

to rely on myself.

to be here,

pretty cool photos
from Discovery.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.797
And he's
the mission commander,

that he's in charge
of a lot of important stuff.

And kinda homicidal.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.746
I think he's just
trying to psych us out.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.415
We'll do something
else to relax.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.500
Although, there's
kind of not much left.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.672
Yoga didn't work,
meditation didn't work.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.587
We tried everything.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.422
Uh, well,
not everything.

12:05.934 --> 12:06.923
Oh?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.137
Oh. (GIGGLES)

12:09.938 --> 12:11.553
FARGO: You know,
when you first came
to Eureka,

12:11.689 --> 12:12.804
I never thought we'd
end up like this.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.806
I mean, I did FTL you
into the woods.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.558
HOLLY: I've had worse
first dates.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.279
This is great.
Best idea ever.
You still stressed?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.072
Not even a little.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.611
Because you're kicking
my wizard's ass.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.402
Or at least,
you were.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.164
Let's see how your
Orc King feels about
a little Fountain of Flame.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.827
In your face.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.743
(GASPS) Critical hit!

12:35.964 --> 12:37.454
Booya!

12:37.590 --> 12:40.502
Harsh. Well,
I still forgive you.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.379
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.834
Mmm. Mmm.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.880
(PHONE VIBRATING)

12:47.475 --> 12:48.931
Is that yours?
It's for you.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.218
Your phone.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.521
Oh, my interview!
My phone, where is it?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.853
I'm not ready.
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.772
Well, Doug,
just be yourself.

13:01.990 --> 13:02.979
Wait.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.285
For luck.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.917
I'll leave the game
here. For later.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.166
Hey.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.800
You find anything yet?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.341
The hull
looks clean.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.633
CARTER: Oh, wait.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.719
What's that? The...

13:30.852 --> 13:34.140
Looks like a piece of metal
jammed into the electron
recombination grid.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.731
Wow.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.934
What? I've been
studying.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.568
So, uh, what
do you think?

13:39.694 --> 13:42.356
Somebody got cut
from the Astraeus project
and they're feeling jilted.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.773
You think it's
an ex-candidate?

13:44.073 --> 13:47.156
Well, the ship
didn't do that
to itself.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.202
Dr. Ward?

13:54.584 --> 13:57.701
Excellent!
You found my missing
photovoltaic capacitor.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.208
Well, not so excellent.
It was rammed up the
backside of the Astraeus.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.915
Ouch.
Here, take a look.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.594
Oh, they nicked it.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.634
Look at that.
Totally useless
to me now.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.015
Any idea who could've
gotten their hands on this?

14:13.144 --> 14:16.728
Anyone, everyone. As you
can see there's plenty
of foot traffic around here.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.600
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

14:18.733 --> 14:21.475
a new photovoltaic capacitor
won't build itself.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.321
Any other
brilliant ideas?

14:28.117 --> 14:30.199
Which side of this thing
was stuck in the Astraeus?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.818
Okay, then how does
the other side get
nicked?

14:31.954 --> 14:34.946
Well, it could have been
fired by some kind
of projectile weapon.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.035
That makes sense.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.247
I mean, it's up pretty high
and someone would have seen
our guy if he used a ladder.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.169
Yeah. If we find
our weapon...

14:42.298 --> 14:43.663
We find our shooter.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.795
I'll measure the groove on
this thing and see if! can
pinpoint what fired it.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.543
Okay.
Yeah.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.929
CARTER: Maize kernels?

Prepare object for chemical
decontamination.

15:09.075 --> 15:13.239
No! No! Person!
Person! Abort!

15:14.414 --> 15:16.826
Uh! Ah!

15:20.962 --> 15:22.327
That's not so bad.

15:22.505 --> 15:26.418
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Stage two.
Stage two? No! Help! Ah!

15:30.596 --> 15:32.211
My face is on fire.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.963
Well, you're lucky it was a
mild chemical burn.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.931
Ah.
All better?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.807
Yeah. Yeah, all...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.646
I think you may have
missed a spot...

15:42.775 --> 15:45.232
Okay, I think
we're in enough
trouble as it is.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.817
You can't blame me
for trying, though.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.107
Hey, do you think
there's a connection

15:49.240 --> 15:51.947
between the ship's sabotage
and your decontamination?

15:52.285 --> 15:56.073
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
if you think about it,
both incidents...

15:56.706 --> 15:57.786
Uh...

15:57.915 --> 16:00.247
No. No, no idea.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.286
Weird though,
that there'd be a trail
of maize kernels.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.039
Weirder than what?
Dried cranberries?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.837
No. Um...

16:12.930 --> 16:14.386
More like deja vu.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.385
Out of all the candidates
why should we pick you?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.603
Why do you
want this?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.386
It's what I've dreamed
of since I was a kid.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.809
Everything I've
done has been
towards this goal.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.809
And yet, you have
quite a history of making,

16:27.945 --> 16:30.482
shall we say,
questionable choices.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.027
The most recent includes
wormholing Dr. Marten.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.275
What? No, no, no,
I swear we've
only just kissed.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.909
The FTL incident,
Dr. Fargo.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.453
(CLEARS THROAT) So,
why should we think
your decision making skills

16:46.589 --> 16:48.500
on this mission
should be any different?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.502
DARLTON: This is awesome.
Give me some love,
give me some love.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.344
Yay! Hey, guys.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.556
How's everybody
doing? All right!
All right, rocketeers.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.809
24 hours until our annual
engine contest and...

17:01.938 --> 17:03.178
CHILDREN: Weenie roast!
Weenie roast.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.689
All right! Okay.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.308

test burn is going
to take home

17:09.445 --> 17:12.152
the prized
Golden Rocket trophy.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.862
My question for you is,

17:14.075 --> 17:17.818
can anyone de-throne
the four-year reign
of the Awesome Possums?

17:17.954 --> 17:18.943
(AWESOME POSSUMS CHEER)

17:19.247 --> 17:22.865
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.
But we're all going
to find out tomorrow!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.865
All right, who's ready
to build some rockets?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.789
Huh? Yeah!
Let's go, come on!

17:30.383 --> 17:31.668
(COUGHING)

17:31.926 --> 17:33.507
This engine's going
to burn too hot.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.799
We need that power if we're
going to stand a chance
kicking Possum butt.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.638
But it's not safe. The whole
thing could ignite.
Shh.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.559
Don't look now.
The Awesome Possums
are headed this way.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.396
Oh, look, it's
the Radical Rejects.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.231
And little Douglas.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.444
You do realize this engine's
supposed to power a rocket?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.063
This thing won't even
make it off the ground.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.485
Oh, our rocket's
going up.

It's over, Fargo.
There's no way
we can win.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.948
Yes, we can. The excess heat
from the engine can be the
additional power we need.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.404
We'll turn those Possums
into road kill.

taste, losers?

There is no second place.
You just don't
get a trophy.

calculations were
a smidge off.

to give me
a call sometime.

I see big
things for you.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.020
The thermocouples
that overloaded
led to a new design

21:23.157 --> 21:26.900
which now generates power
for the RTGs aboard
the Cassini spacecraft.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.702
If I've learned anything
over the years,

21:30.831 --> 21:33.868
it's that being bold
and being innovative
go hand in hand.

21:34.043 --> 21:37.911
So would I make the same
questionable choices during
the Astraeus mission?

21:39.507 --> 21:40.917
I'm going to try, Senator.

Thank you
for your time,
Dr. Fargo.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.700
Hey, Carter! Hey.
Yeah?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.448
I heard about
your chemical bath.
You okay?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.701
Uh, yeah, a little
itchy but I'm
all right. Is, is...

23:41.921 --> 23:43.127
Is that our weapon?
Yeah, yeah.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.495
You see how
the gash lines up

23:44.632 --> 23:46.338
with the bow's
release mechanism?

23:46.467 --> 23:48.753
Yeah. Yes, um,

23:48.886 --> 23:50.922
so our rod's
an arrow.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.470
At some point
we're going to stop
calling it a rod, right?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.805
Oh, where's
the fun in that?

23:57.603 --> 23:58.968
Oh!
Oh, God!

24:02.566 --> 24:04.727
Because today couldn't
get any weirder, huh?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.782
Dr. Parrish walked away

24:10.908 --> 24:12.819
and then I felt
this burning pain
on my neck,

24:12.952 --> 24:14.408
then I was
on the ground.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.027
I don't remember
anything after that.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.828
You didn't
see anyone?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.448
I don't know who did this,
but they were smooth.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.869
I never saw them coming.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.958
What would they want
with his uniform?

24:24.088 --> 24:25.874
I have no idea.

Yeah, go on. Go on.
I got this.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.504
Are you...
Are you sure?
Yeah. I got this.

24:31.637 --> 24:32.922
Okay. Excuse me.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.633
Thanks, man.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.973

Uh, Dr. Marten, thank you
for sharing your lengthy
history of your...

24:43.899 --> 24:45.764
Oh, oh, and there was
this one time
at space camp.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.811
I went to the real one,

24:46.944 --> 24:48.525
but there was another one
called Galaxy Camp

24:48.654 --> 24:50.645
that got shut down
for safety violations.

24:50.781 --> 24:54.444
Anyway, I configured
the lights to turn on at night
every hour and a half,

24:54.576 --> 24:57.318
since astronauts have to learn
how to sleep with a sunrise
every 90 minutes

24:57.454 --> 24:58.785
during real missions.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.996
That did not go over
with my roommates as well
as you might think.

don't need to hear any more.

Thanks.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.219
Hey! Henry,
what you got?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.764
Well, I finished my
analysis on the
decontamination chamber.

25:22.896 --> 25:27.481
And it was set for
auto-decon as soon as
someone stepped inside.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.224
Yeah, but anyone
could have followed
that trail.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.644
I mean, who sets a trap
without a specific
target in mind?

25:32.781 --> 25:33.770
That doesn't make sense.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.239
Makes as much sense
as shooting an arrow
into Astraeus

25:36.368 --> 25:38.700
or attacking a guard
for his uniform.
Yeah.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.742
Well, unless
they needed to gain
access to something.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.115

are you on some medication?

26:07.775 --> 26:10.892
Shh. It's almost time.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.610
Okay, time for what?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.817
We're going
to disappear.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.483
But it'll be okay.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.736
Just for luck.
Okay, what the hell
are you doing?

26:23.874 --> 26:26.081
You know, we've seen
all this before.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.204
When I was,
uh, at Harvard,

26:28.337 --> 26:31.170
I lured an invisible cat
into a shower using
maize kernels.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.590
Yeah, but you didn't lure
yourself into the
decontamination chamber.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.300
No, but, but, uh...

26:38.931 --> 26:41.138
The arrow. When, uh...

26:41.266 --> 26:42.847
When you turned on
the Astraeus shield,

26:42.976 --> 26:44.716
it looked like
lightning. That
sounds familiar.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.762
Oh, yeah, yeah, Fargo's
runaway positronic
lightning array.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.980
You had to shoot an arrow
into the dump coil
to ground it.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.818
Exactly. Everything that's
happening now has
happened before, but...

26:54.446 --> 26:56.277
To me.
So you think this
is a copycat?

26:57.407 --> 26:59.193
Now, only a handful
of people knew
about Fargo's experiment.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.362
And Zoe's the only one
who knew about
the invisible cat.

27:01.495 --> 27:05.909
And the uniform,
I stole 63 years ago,
in another timeline, so...

27:06.542 --> 27:07.952

know where he went.

Well, um, he's acting
out our memories.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.503
Well, mine, anyway.
He got zapped.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.505
When he touched
your neural interface.

assume it happened.

28:43.889 --> 28:44.753
Easy,easy,easy.

28:44.890 --> 28:49.054
So, the surge must have
transferred the recordings
over to him somehow.

he's me.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.442
It's how I ended
up in Eureka.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.784
Well, your brothers
definitely won't be able
to match you this time.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.122
I'd say
going to Titan

34:46.751 --> 34:48.912
would trump
anything that they
could do on Earth.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.917
I guess so.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.182
CARTER: Warren, if you can
hear me, pick up the radio!

35:04.894 --> 35:06.930
Warren, pick up the radio!

35:08.523 --> 35:09.512
Who is this?

35:09.649 --> 35:12.482
Right. Warren, you're not
thinking like yourself
right now.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.351
Why don't you just pull
over? We can talk about it.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.772
No, I can't stop!

35:15.905 --> 35:16.894
l have to save her.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.772
What's he
talking about?
Save who?

35:18.908 --> 35:20.159
Uh, who are you saving?

35:20.327 --> 35:22.784
Allison! I'm head
over heels in love
with her

35:22.912 --> 35:25.289
and l have been
since the day we met.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.906
I've got to stop
Grant and Beverly!

35:28.043 --> 35:29.374
Oh, he's headed
for the warehouse.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.460
HENRY: The warehouse
was set up inside
a holographic field.

35:32.589 --> 35:33.829
A mirage.
He's heading
for a cliff.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.876
Yeah, he's going
to Thelma and Louise
right over it.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.682
I trust me.
I trust me.
I trust me.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.689
I trust me. I trust me.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.074
How're we going
to cut him off before
he gets to the cliff?

36:03.912 --> 36:05.152
Yeah, well, he's
a quarter mile away
from the cliff.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.869
We got to go now!
All right.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.745
I trust me. I trust me.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.761
Warren, I know what you're
thinking right now

36:22.889 --> 36:26.222
and whatever you do,
do not trust yourself!

36:26.351 --> 36:27.466
How do you...

36:32.190 --> 36:35.853
Listen. Allison's okay.
If you pull over,
I'll take you to her.

36:36.236 --> 36:39.194
No! I saw her.
She's dead.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.482
They killed her.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.489
l have to do this!

37:03.054 --> 37:05.841
All right, Warren,
you've gone far enough.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.224
What? What are you doing?

37:10.520 --> 37:14.012
No, you can't.
No, you're letting her die.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.639
It's all fine. Okay?

37:15.775 --> 37:18.437
She's dying! No!

37:19.487 --> 37:21.773
(WARREN SOBBING)

37:21.906 --> 37:23.771
She's going to be fine.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.407
I promise. Okay?

37:29.414 --> 37:30.403
(MOUTHING)

37:30.540 --> 37:31.825
Didn't say anything.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.616
Yeah, yeah, I know.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.910
Who's a big guy?

37:42.135 --> 37:43.875
So how long before
we know if it
worked?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.798
Well, we shorted out
the neural pathways

37:45.930 --> 37:48.922
and suppressed the
acetylcholine production
in the basal forebrain.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.425
So, hopefully,
that will inhibit his ability
to retain short-term memory.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.767
But these techniques
have never been used
for this purpose before.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.686
Meaning an hour, or...

37:59.778 --> 38:00.813
Maybe two.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.693
Two. Good, great.
You want to go
for dinner?

38:03.406 --> 38:04.816
The man holds
the key to our future.

38:04.949 --> 38:08.237
We just fried a bunch
of neurons in his brain and
you want to go out for pizza?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.746
No, I want to go
for Chinese.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.695
(ALL CHUCKLING)

38:12.957 --> 38:15.824
There's nothing
to do here but wait,
so you should go.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.666
Ah. Are you sure?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.377
Go. We'll call you
when he wakes up.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.339
Great. You see, I think
we should let the fortune
cookie decide our future.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.502
Oh, yeah, that's
a good...

38:23.635 --> 38:24.590
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's a good plan.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.708
Wait, hold.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.056
Uh, it's from
the Senator.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.843
She had to head back
to Washington.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.138
They've made their
final selections for
the Astraeus mission

38:34.270 --> 38:36.101
and she wants
me to inform
the candidates.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.236
You guys
need anything?

38:46.366 --> 38:47.401
No. We're good.
No, thank you.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.569
Okay.

38:55.917 --> 38:56.906
Hey.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.159
Hey, yourself.

39:02.465 --> 39:06.174
Um, the list is about
to come out with
the final selection.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.500
So I've heard.

39:07.971 --> 39:11.964
I asked Allison
if, if! could...

39:14.310 --> 39:16.050
You didn't make it, Jo.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.973
You're so sweet,
Carter, but I know.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.775
Did, uh,
did Zane make it?

39:25.488 --> 39:28.275
Uh, yeah.

39:29.951 --> 39:33.068
Jo. How could
you know?

39:34.664 --> 39:36.825
I withdrew my name
from consideration.

39:37.584 --> 39:38.664
You what?

39:41.546 --> 39:43.958
I'll let...
I'll let you two...
I gotta...

39:48.720 --> 39:50.051
Hey.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.305
I don't get it.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.296
Why would you drop out?

39:53.474 --> 39:55.510
We worked so hard
for this.
We all did.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.603
You really earned it, Zane.
Congratulations.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.267
You're really
not going
to tell me?

40:03.568 --> 40:06.526
Did you hear what I said?
You're going to Titan.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.942
No. We did this
together. We should be
going together.

40:10.867 --> 40:14.234
Space isn't my dream.
Not like it is
for the rest of you.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.827
To me it was just
another challenge.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.043
If you're going to travel
a billion miles for something,

40:24.172 --> 40:25.958
it's got to mean
more than that.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.129
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

40:35.725 --> 40:37.681
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

40:40.146 --> 40:42.102
(PHONE BEEPING)
Ah!

40:48.154 --> 40:49.860
Did you?
Yeah.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.521
Did you?

40:51.866 --> 40:54.107
We made it!
We made it!

40:54.577 --> 40:55.566
(CHEERING)

40:56.454 --> 40:58.194
Yay!
Oh, sorry.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.579
Congratulations,
Dr. Marten.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.002
You earned it.
Thank you, Isaac.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.425
Mighty big of you,
Parrish.

41:13.721 --> 41:17.964
Your selection is merely
another example of bureaucracy
rewarding mediocrity.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.842
l weep for Titan.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.810
Whoa.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.854
We made it!
We made it!

41:30.947 --> 41:32.812
I can't believe
I passed out.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.816
That must have been
some delicious wine.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.659
Oh, it was.
Vincent grows
his own grapes.

41:38.788 --> 41:41.825
He has a vineyard
in his backyard.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.450
Strange though.
I can't remember anything
from the whole day.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.919
Huh. It's not like you led us
on a crazy car chase
and nearly drove off a cliff.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.329
(LAUGHS)

41:51.467 --> 41:55.631
Well, it was really
great to see both of you

41:55.930 --> 41:58.467
and l have
the recordings
right in here.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.009
But I don't need
to look at them.

42:00.143 --> 42:03.260
That's just a
formality.
We figured as much.

42:03.396 --> 42:04.932
I mean, really...

42:05.648 --> 42:08.936
No one in their
right mind would keep
the two of you apart.

42:09.652 --> 42:14.942
Ah. You... You guys,
you're perfect together.

42:15.742 --> 42:16.822
I don't know what it is,

42:16.951 --> 42:21.536
but I just feel
such an incredibly
strong connection to you.

42:21.664 --> 42:25.703
ljust...
lgetyou.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.949
You know?

42:27.086 --> 42:30.920
Yeah.
And obviously,
we both...

42:31.049 --> 42:33.040
I mean, we feel the same.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.882
Both of us, absolutely.

42:35.178 --> 42:40.514
Oh, I am going
to miss you guys
so much.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.924
Ditto, Warren.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.509
(CHUCKLES)

42:49.942 --> 42:50.931
Call me!

42:51.944 --> 42:53.070
Will do.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.358
Who was that?

42:58.117 --> 43:00.324
You know, emotional memories
and declarative memories

43:00.453 --> 43:02.193
are accessed
from different parts
of the brain.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.070
I wonder if when
Grace and I...

43:04.207 --> 43:06.949
Oh, shh,
let's not
overthink it.

43:08.044 --> 43:11.502
Right now,
I'd like
to celebrate.
