WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.201
Previously on Grimm...

00:06.720 --> 00:08.210
We should do this more often.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.441
Is Nick okay?

00:09.520 --> 00:10.521
No, and I need to
know where he is.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.843
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but he has to drink this.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.729
Nick! Nick!
Oh, God!

00:17.840 --> 00:19.126
Take it, Nick.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.608
Everybody just back off!
No!

00:21.760 --> 00:23.091
How did they know
that she was a Grimm?

00:23.160 --> 00:25.208
Trubel walked right in
while everyone was Woged.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.281
No, they weren't.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.521
You really couldn't see 'em?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.086
No.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.086
"Knowledge is Power."

00:37.440 --> 00:38.965
Police Captain Sean Renard,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.849
right upper, left lower.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.046
Get him on the table.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.963
Two, three...

00:44.120 --> 00:45.451
Stent's in, breathing.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.726
V-tach on the scope.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.400
All right let's call down,
get me five liters on standby.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.886
When did he go in?

00:55.360 --> 00:56.850
Do they know how bad it is?

00:57.520 --> 00:58.646
Yeah.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.805
Yeah, thanks.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.406
Captain's in surgery now.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.801
They don't know anything except
he's been shot more than once.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.291
Three times, I think.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.089
He was gonna shoot him again,
except he saw me.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.321
That's when I ran.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.602
Had you ever seen him before?
No.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.001
And he didn't know
I was a Grimm until he Woged.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.602
- He was Wesen?
- A Hundjager.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.651
He was kind of surprised. That's
why I had time to get the machete.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.880
He thought I was just a girl.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.729
I wish I could've seen his face,

01:23.560 --> 01:24.607
before you cut it off.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.161
Did the Captain say what was in the
bottle that he wanted me to take?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.084
No, he just said
you had to drink it,

01:29.160 --> 01:31.367
or something
really bad would happen.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.041
And Adalind did it.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.291
Hey, maybe what she
did to you won't last.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.407
You don't know Adalind.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.811
She's a Hexenbiest, a witch.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.367
In more ways than one.
Oh, yeah, I read about them.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.562
That's how she transformed
herself to look like me.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.766
She did What?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.205
She made Nick think it was me.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.446
Why in the hell would she...

01:49.600 --> 01:50.965
So Nick would sleep with her.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.207
I swear to God I'm gonna
find her and I'm gonna...

01:59.840 --> 02:01.888
We should turn around.
We have to deal with this.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.166
I killed that guy.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.160
In self-defense. They're
gonna be all over Trubel.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.485
What am I supposed to say?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.409
You're just
gonna tell the truth,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.040
except for the part
about the Hundjager.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.000
And Adalind. And the bottle
he brought for Nick.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.441
All right, look. We better
figure this out pretty quick.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.250
And if we have to lie,

02:20.320 --> 02:22.322
we better all be
telling the same one.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.920
Henry Slocombe
was lead engineer.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.042
Importance
of our allies...

02:41.560 --> 02:43.040
All right it's
a CVA project...

02:45.160 --> 02:47.766
What I'm talking about here
is Smart Censor Technologies.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.729
These have a yield
resistance on a regional...

02:49.800 --> 02:51.404
We have to have
military preparedness.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.006
No, I think what we need... persistent
threats on the national level.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.764
It's unprecedented.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.322
No,
Alexandra's still in Paris.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.608
Yeah, she's not home
until Thursday.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.962
No. No,
I'm not having a good time.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.371
See, unlike you,

03:11.440 --> 03:13.283
I actually miss my girlfriend
when she's gone.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.005
Yeah.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.881
Hey, listen, I've got somebody at the door.
Can I call you right back?

03:17.960 --> 03:19.610
Okay. All right.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.930
Yes?
Henry Slocombe.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.451
Do I know you?
Sort of.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.121
I'm a friend of Danny Rivera's.
Lawrence Anderson.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.448
Sure, yeah, Dr. Anderson.
Yeah.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.727
Yeah, you're working on the
CVA project up in Arlington.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.801
Right.
Yeah.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.928
I'm sorry we've never had a
chance to meet face to face.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.081
Oh, me too.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.970
Danny's always spoken
very highly of you.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.880
So, what can I do for you?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.962
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.404
I just got into
town for a conference.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.730
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.320
Danny has been in
a terrible accident.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.481
What?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.449
I didn't wanna do
this over the phone.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.003
Oh, my God.
I hadn't even heard anything.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.686
I'm sorry. Yeah, why don't you come on in?
Please. Come on in.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.366
I probably should have called.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.487
No, that's okay.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.205
What have you heard?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.366
How bad is it?

04:08.480 --> 04:10.005
I don't have all the details.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.004
Some sort of severe head injury.

04:17.839 --> 04:18.841
No!

05:03.360 --> 05:04.327
Forceps, Doctor.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.890
Bullet fragment
hit the pericardial sac.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.764
Administering fluids.
I'm seeing a liver laceration.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.760
A bullet has tumbled,
it's pressing on his spine.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.245
He's bleeding like a sieve.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.485
That's one.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.931
What if they arrest me?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.206
All right, just remember
it was self-defense.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.487
What about the machete? How's
she gonna explain that?

05:24.560 --> 05:27.404
Just tell them it was mine,
and I keep it in that room.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.730
Hey, Burkhardt
and Griffin just got here.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.250
Did you hear me?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
What?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.920
I said they're here,
Burkhardt and Griffin.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.968
Hey.
Where you guys been?

05:47.040 --> 05:49.441
We were at a wedding.
Had our phones turned off.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.647
Isn't that
the Captain's car?

05:50.720 --> 05:51.721
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.081
Hey, who's the primary on this?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.207
Uh, Meacham and Pogue.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.691
Listen, we got some bad news.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.205
We know, Captain's been shot.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.521
We just got off the phone
with the hospital.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.601
He's in surgery.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.761
Yeah, he's lucky to be alive.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.041
When we brought
him out of the house,

06:02.120 --> 06:04.160
I didn't think he was gonna
make it to the hospital.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.891
I know you.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.042
The criminology student, right?
Uh, yeah.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.770
Yeah, Theresa's
been staying with us.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.126
Good thing you weren't here.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.689
She was.
Did you see what happened?

06:16.760 --> 06:17.807
Yes.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.006
She killed the shooter.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.121
What?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.486
The guy's head was cut off.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.082
He tried to kill her
after he shot the Captain.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.203
All right, we better get with
Meacham and Pogue on this.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.321
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.925
They're inside.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.007
And you stay here. We're
gonna talk to them first.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.606
You Okay?

06:43.480 --> 06:44.720
Sort of.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.760
This is where we
found the Captain.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.080
Where's the shooter?

06:55.640 --> 06:57.290
The rest
of him's upstairs.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.687
Have you identified him?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.086
Yeah, and it's gonna be a mess

07:03.160 --> 07:04.491
'cause he was an FBI agent.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.247
Name's Weston Steward.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.850
He was carrying
a Canadian passport with

07:07.920 --> 07:09.649
his picture in the name
of Walter Rathenau,

07:09.720 --> 07:10.926
along with a lot of Euros.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.287
Yeah, he probably wasn't
planning on sticking around.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.281
So, Theresa was
staying in the guest room?

07:16.680 --> 07:17.841
Yeah.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.409
There are bullet
holes in the door.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.091
And, I found a book,
kind of a weird book.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.561
I mean, is it her book?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.444
A diary, really old.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.886
They talk about
cutting off people's heads.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.928
They're not really people, they
have really strange names...

07:33.000 --> 07:34.286
Yeah, the book's mine.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.086
It's been handed down in
my family for a long time.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.810
What kind of book is it?

07:39.440 --> 07:40.805
Just a bunch of stories.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.565
Really weird ones.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.925
Hey.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.490
Hey, Burkhardt, Hank.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.567
Last place we expected
to get a case like this.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.926
You weren't here
when it happened, right?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.240
Uh, we were at a wedding.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.323
And you were with him?
Since about three.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.920
You know why
Captain Renard was here?

07:57.320 --> 07:59.129
Could have been a case
we were working on.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.766
You knew anything about
this Weston Steward,

08:01.880 --> 08:04.087
or why he shot the Captain? No.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.044
Got any idea
who killed the shooter?

08:07.880 --> 08:09.120
He didn't cut off his own head.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.489
That would be Theresa.
She was staying here.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.249
It was self-defense. He tried to
attack her after he shot the Captain.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.368
She called 911,
then came and got us.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.688
We'll need to talk to her.
She got a last name?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.842
Rubel.
And she's waiting outside.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.289
Hey, maybe it would be better
if I just got out of here.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.526
No, I think that would be worse.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.090
Just remember
what Nick told you.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.281
Hey, Juliette.
Hey.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.408
Theresa, these are Detectives
Pogue and Meacham.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.527
They just need to ask
you a few questions.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.760
Okay.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.606
We just want you to walk
us through what happened.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.291
Uh, we got company.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.441
FBI.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.760
It's about time.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.611
FBI?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.241
What are they doing here?

08:53.320 --> 08:55.120
The guy you killed
used to be a federal agent.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
What?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.880
He was a bad guy, and we
need to deal with this.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.241
Pleased to meet you.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.450
You cannot run.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.966
The nature of our
defensive resources...

09:50.680 --> 09:51.841
Alexandra.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.166
Do I know you? You're
supposed to be in Paris.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.283
Henry? Are you all right?

10:02.240 --> 10:03.844
Who are you?

10:08.480 --> 10:10.050
Oh, my God.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.965
You were supposed to
come home tomorrow!

10:42.400 --> 10:43.845
I'm Special Agent Chavez,

10:43.920 --> 10:45.729
this is Special Agent Rosten.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.725
The detectives have filled us
in on some of what happened.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.204
Detective Burkhardt, we understand
that this is your house

10:52.280 --> 10:53.566
and you were not here
at the time of the attack?

10:53.640 --> 10:54.641
That is correct.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.529
But Miss Rubel was staying here.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.761
In our upstairs guest room.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.043
Walk us through what happened.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.090
I should come along with you.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.685
That won't be necessary.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.441
She can handle this, Nick.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.200
What if she gets
tripped up on a detail?

11:09.240 --> 11:10.765
You gotta let them do their job.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.081
Can't let it look like we
had anything to do with it.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.603
They're gonna want
formal statements.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.843
Then you're gonna
have to go into the precinct.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.526
I don't want you
staying here alone.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.648
No, I'm not leaving.
It's our house.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.083
Okay, he... He opened the
door and was leaving,

11:28.160 --> 11:30.367
and then I heard these sounds,

11:30.440 --> 11:31.680
and I didn't know what they were

11:31.720 --> 11:34.610
until he fell back into
the room on the floor.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.206
What happened then?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.124
I looked up and saw
the guy with the gun.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.521
And he saw me,
so I ran and he shot.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.166
That's the bullet hole.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.127
Had you ever seen the man
who shot at you before?

11:53.920 --> 11:54.967
No.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.121
What happened next?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.044
Well, I ran up the stairs,
and he came after me.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.810
I ran in here
and I, uh, shut the door.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.642
And I grabbed the chair,
I put it against the door.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.564
And then he shot, so I jumped
back, and I hit my head there,

12:15.640 --> 12:18.007
and then I fell back
somewhere around here.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.561
Um...

12:19.840 --> 12:21.046
Then by the time
I was getting up,

12:21.120 --> 12:22.640
he was already
coming through the door.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.248
Where did you get the machete?
It was on the chair.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.251
He was coming after me,

12:29.320 --> 12:32.130
so I just shoved him into the
hallway, and closed my eyes,

12:32.240 --> 12:33.685
and I swung as hard as I could.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.808
You always keep
a machete in your room?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.360
It's not mine, it's Nick's.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.490
Uh, Detective Burkhardt's.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.965
How long have you
been staying here?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.485
A few weeks.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.726
We're gonna
need you to come down

12:46.800 --> 12:48.848
to the precinct and make
a formal statement.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.486
AUSTRIA

12:52.560 --> 12:54.608
We can't afford
to have her elected.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.011
I don't care what it costs.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.129
Dig up whatever you can, make
something up if you have to,

12:59.200 --> 13:00.326
but bring her down.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.924
Is this important?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.528
Weston Steward shot Sean Renard.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.204
I'll ring you back.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.681
And he got away with it?

13:12.760 --> 13:13.966
Not exactly.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.767
He was beheaded.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.851
Burkhardt killed Steward?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.162
We don't know, but it did happen

13:20.240 --> 13:22.288
in his house, where
the shooting took place.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.570
So, Sean Renard is dead.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.210
No, he's in hospital.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.090
I haven't been able to get details,
except that it's critical.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.729
I'll have to inform the King.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.002
My uncle does love
his bastard son.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.084
Should he lose a second son,
there will be hell to pay.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.004
What happens
if the King finds out

13:43.080 --> 13:44.650
Weston Steward was one of ours?

13:45.760 --> 13:47.808
That would be unfortunate.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.847
It is imperative
that you tie Mr. Steward

13:50.920 --> 13:52.922
to Mr. Burkhardt
instead of us.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.921
Why are you calling?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.082
Iran into a problem.
We have to abort.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.207
Are you done?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.281
I have one more.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.442
Then you can't leave.
You don't understand...

14:27.520 --> 14:29.363
Whatever the problem,
it's your problem.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.568
If you don't finish,
then it's my problem.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.331
If that happens, it really
will be your problem.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.802
This could get serious.
We have collateral.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.005
Then I'm coming up there.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.287
But you are not to
leave until it's done.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.840
We good for
letting them take the body?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.286
Yeah.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.645
What do you make of the girl?

15:21.880 --> 15:25.601
She sees a police captain get
shot, killer tries to shoot her,

15:25.960 --> 15:27.371
and she chops his head off?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.287
If it was my daughter,
she'd be a basket case.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.407
Yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.966
Girl's not normal.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.682
If she was, she'd be dead.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.726
What's that?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.206
Nothing.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.322
We're done.
Sorry it's such a mess.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.806
No.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.167
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be on your honeymoon.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.964
Couldn't do it.
Not with what happened.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.730
Please, you guys, don't
let us drag you into this

17:17.800 --> 17:20.040
more than you've already
been dragged into it.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.241
Juliette, are you kidding me?

17:21.319 --> 17:23.367
You think we could go anywhere
with what's going on?

17:24.839 --> 17:25.840
You could try.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.285
We don't want to try.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.401
Where's Nick?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.124
He had to take
Trubel to the precinct.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.045
Is this where
Renard was shot?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.326
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.570
Oh, my God.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.969
Juliette, this is terrible.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.120
I'm just really sorry that all this
stuff happened on your wedding day.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.002
Did Captain Renard tell you why he
came to see Detective Burkhardt?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.965
He said he needed
to talk to him.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.328
Did he say anything else
before he was shot?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.409
I said
Nick was at the wedding,

17:59.480 --> 18:01.767
and told him where it was.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.251
And that's when he walked
out the door and got shot.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.561
And you said you
didn't know the identity

18:05.640 --> 18:07.165
of the man who shot
Captain Renard.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.007
Never seen him.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.889
What did he do when he
came into the house?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.048
Well, I think he was gonna
shoot the Captain again.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.331
Then he saw me and decided to
shoot at me instead, so...

18:20.360 --> 18:21.850
Her story's consistent.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.371
You took
the Captain's car.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.808
Yeah, I didn't have a choice.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.291
But you left
the scene of a crime.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.566
To get Nick.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.883
Everything she says
matches the crime scene.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.167
There's no link
between her and Steward.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.203
No motive other
than self-defense.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.203
I think she's telling the truth.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.288
Flight number and arrival time?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.884
All right, thanks.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.566
Did I ask for coffee?

18:54.640 --> 18:55.721
No.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.645
Nick,
you gotta take it easy.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.881
You don't wanna look nervous.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.245
Do I look nervous? Second cup
of coffee I didn't ask for.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.565
Now, sit down.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.210
Don't drink any more of that.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.770
I just found out
where Adalind is.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.327
She boarded Lufthansa
flight number 4582

19:12.400 --> 19:14.209
through Frankfurt to Vienna.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.321
She's going back to the Royals.
Makes sense.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.760
She thinks they have her baby.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.490
They must have made
some kind of deal.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.005
Yeah, you.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.771
But she's gonna be very upset

19:23.840 --> 19:25.600
when she finds out
they don't have the child.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.011
Stop with the coffee, okay?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.526
We're done here for now.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.523
Miss Rubel's story
is consistent.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.204
No reason to charge her
for anything.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.210
She's handling it pretty well

19:36.760 --> 19:38.603
for someone who just
cut off a guy's head.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.649
Well, if I knew something
like this was gonna happen,

19:40.720 --> 19:42.848
I would have never
left her alone in the house.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.770
As long as you're here,

19:49.040 --> 19:50.690
you have any idea why your agent

19:50.760 --> 19:52.330
would want to shoot our captain?

19:52.520 --> 19:55.046
Weston Steward went off the
grid several weeks ago.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.246
We've had no contact.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.244
We don't know who
he's working with or why.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.445
So if you guys have
any ideas, we're open.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.605
We'll be talking.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.681
Was she staring at you?

20:11.760 --> 20:12.760
Yeah, seemed like.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.881
What's she seeing?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.121
Maybe something Trubel said.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.204
How'd it go?
Okay.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.204
- Can we get out of here now?
- All right, you guys go.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.321
I'm gonna check on the Captain.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.600
Let me know what you find out.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.280
Kent, I think you
better come down here.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.767
What's the problem?

21:01.840 --> 21:04.320
I think Dr. Slocombe has
logged into the CVA operation.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.640
Are the access codes correct?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.806
Yes,
but I think he's off-site.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.000
You want me to call this in?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.850
Uh, probably just
working from home.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.320
As long as the access codes are
right, I'm not too worried.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.769
Let me see what he's doing.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.204
Hi. You've reached Dr.
Henry Slocombe.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.441
Please leave me a message.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.010
He's not answering.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.011
Well, he just logged out.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.604
Hey. What do you know?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.247
Well, just that he's been in
surgery over three hours.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.286
Remember when you told me
that there were things

22:02.360 --> 22:04.089
that you'd seen that
you couldn't explain?

22:04.560 --> 22:05.721
Yeah.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.409
I don't know,
maybe I'm just tired.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.888
But that book at Nick's
was not a normal book.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.686
There were pictures in it.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.005
And the drawings
looked a little like

22:18.080 --> 22:19.809
what I thought I saw that time.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.885
And from what he wrote,
I got the impression that

22:23.960 --> 22:27.123
these monsters were somehow inside
people, like they were possessed.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.927
Am I making any sense at all?
Hey.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.524
Monsters do live inside people.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.125
We deal with them every day.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.805
This is different.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.365
I think whoever wrote this stuff
really saw what they drew.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.884
When you told me that you'd
seen things, what did you mean?

22:49.120 --> 22:51.964
I was just saying that
when people get angry,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.043
out of control,
their faces start to change.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.400
It's like
they're not even human.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.640
Something like that.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.964
I don't know. I don't know.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.561
Nobody sees
the world the same way.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.762
And you can't
explain everything.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.565
I'm still having nightmares.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.881
Wu...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.682
I gotta tell you something.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.240
Last year, I thought

23:25.320 --> 23:27.402
I was losing my mind,
too, until...

23:27.480 --> 23:29.130
Sergeant?
Yes, Doctor.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.523
Uh, this is Detective Griffin.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.643
I wish I had better news.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.404
Captain Renard
is out of surgery,

23:35.480 --> 23:39.007
but, well, he's lost a great deal of
blood, and there's a lot of damage.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.930
His kidneys may shut down.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.841
It's appropriate that you
contact his next of kin

23:44.920 --> 23:46.600
and have them get here
as soon as possible.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.571
Yeah. Thank you.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.171
Thank you.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.927
The Captain brought something
for Nick to drink.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.327
That's what Trubel had in the
bottle that broke, right?

24:12.440 --> 24:13.441
Yeah.
Thank you.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.204
Then we have to find out
what was in that bottle.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.051
I bet the Captain knows. Not that
he's in any position to tell us.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.566
Adalind would know.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.524
I don't think she's
gonna volunteer anything.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.410
Well, I sure would like to
ask her, and not politely.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.847
How did it go?

24:28.920 --> 24:31.161
Well, no charges were filed,
so we're good for now.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.009
Monroe, Rosalee,
you shouldn't be here.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.963
I know, they should
be on their honeymoon.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.650
Nick.
Honestly, man.

24:36.720 --> 24:37.846
What, are we
gonna be hanging out

24:37.920 --> 24:39.445
on a beach with
what's happening here?

24:39.560 --> 24:42.040
I am so sorry I screwed
up your wedding.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.243
I didn't know everybody was...

24:44.360 --> 24:47.284
Trubel, you did what
you had to do for Nick.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.920
And what we gotta do
right now is find Adalind.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.168
Well, that's not gonna happen,
'cause she's on a flight to Vienna.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.526
She's headed back to Vienna?

24:55.160 --> 24:56.685
How's the Captain doing, anyway?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.240
Not good.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.931
He might not survive.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.164
I had the stuff
you needed in my hand.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.920
I should have just
kept going right to you.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.690
Adalind did this, not you.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.723
We just have to find out how.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.161
She slept with Nick.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.885
Oh, my God!
What?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.166
It's not what you think.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.566
Well, that's good to hear,

25:14.640 --> 25:16.881
because what I'm thinking
is pretty damn awful.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.961
It wasn't Adalind.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.244
Oh, no?
Okay, it was Adalind,

25:20.320 --> 25:21.651
but she didn't
look like Adalind.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.127
She somehow made herself
look just like Juliette.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.966
Oh, no.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.288
That is not a good,
"Oh, no."

25:29.520 --> 25:33.081
I'm just hoping this isn't some
sort of Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.361
A what?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.487
An entwining twin curse.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.528
They make a mess of things.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.165
All right, well,
best place to start

25:39.240 --> 25:41.163
cleaning up a mess
is the Spice Shop.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.085
Nick, we won't let
Adalind do this to you.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.881
Okay?

25:46.960 --> 25:48.086
Okay.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.881
Hey.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.809
Look, man,

25:57.880 --> 26:00.121
I don't want you screwing
up your life because of me.

26:00.360 --> 26:01.486
Dude.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.404
I wouldn't even have a life to screw
up if it wasn't for you, okay?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.649
So quit complaining.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.290
Hey, maybe we should
be going to the trailer.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.488
Maybe there's something...
No, not tonight, all right?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.642
We all just need
to get some rest.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.201
Okay-

26:22.160 --> 26:23.969
I guess I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.645
Do you feel any different?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.649
Can you talk to me?
I don't know.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.283
It happened so fast.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.007
Oh, wow,
this is really screwed up.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.648
And you know I would
never have done that.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.888
You really couldn't tell
that Adalind wasn't me?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.047
No.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.922
No, she looked and sounded
exactly like you.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.800
I guess she wasn't
interested in talking.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.250
Look, I'll sleep on the couch.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.041
Hey, we're not doing that again.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.451
Hey, I found some interesting
stuff on Weston Steward.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.331
Last call he made was to
a number in Rotterdam.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.891
GQR Industries.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.969
We know what the connection is?
Working on it.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.281
They also found Steward's car

27:42.360 --> 27:44.283
parked a block away
from Burkhardt's house.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.965
Packed suitcase inside.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.241
Where's the suitcase?

27:47.320 --> 27:48.401
They just brought it in.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.571
Let's have a look.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.691
Your eyes.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.849
Something's wrong.
They're normal.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.923
Can you see me?
Are you Woged?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.201
Oh, my God!

28:33.760 --> 28:35.091
Whoa...

28:36.240 --> 28:37.520
You wearing that to the wedding?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.371
Unless somebody
takes it off me first.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.361
Really?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.487
Yeah.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.770
This whole wedding thing has kind
of put me in a romantic mood.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.571
I support that.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.364
You do, do you?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.924
I wish our friends would
get married more often.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.760
I was wondering
where you were.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.045
I didn't want you
to wake up to this.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.680
You should go back to bed.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.681
No, let me do this.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.725
Not alone.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.565
I don't know,

29:52.880 --> 29:54.370
maybe this is a good thing.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.721
What do you mean?

29:56.640 --> 29:58.005
For us.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.050
My not being a Grimm anymore.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.289
Three pairs
of boxer shorts,

30:11.360 --> 30:13.124
six pairs of socks.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.647
Whoa.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.086
Here's something.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.961
Euros, Canadian dollars,
pesos, rubles.

30:31.760 --> 30:36.004
Passports from Germany,
France, United Kingdom.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.251
He was definitely ready to roll.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.931
Looks like Mr. Steward
was working

30:40.000 --> 30:41.604
for someone other than the FBI.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.605
We need to check bank
accounts, phone records.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.364
Run this guy down.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.731
How many bodies?

30:50.480 --> 30:51.720
Any witnesses?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.648
Okay, I can be there
in 15 minutes.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.601
Okay.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.887
You get any more sleep last night?
Not much.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.566
You gonna be okay?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.365
I don't know, it's weird,

31:06.920 --> 31:09.730
you know,
not being weird anymore.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.926
Just being a regular cop.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.450
You were really
good at it before.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.524
I guess we'll see if I still am.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.166
Bye.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.164
Morning.
Morning.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.520
You okay?

31:46.120 --> 31:47.804
Working on it. How about you?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.241
Same.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.566
Hey, can I borrow
your bike today?

31:50.640 --> 31:52.005
Sure, you don't have to ask.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.849
Just be careful.
I will.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.565
Hey, what I mean is,

31:58.240 --> 31:59.685
you're the only
Grimm in town now.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.366
So, you need to be careful.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.770
Housekeeper let herself
in about 8:30 this morning.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.410
House belongs to
Dr. Henry Slocombe,

32:15.480 --> 32:17.403
works at Sitre Corporation
here in Portland.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.284
Defense contractor, right?
Yeah.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.683
Housekeeper discovered
the body, called 911.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.450
She didn't see anyone
entering or leaving.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.045
Front door was
closed and locked.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.242
We checked the premises,
no signs of any break-in.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.330
Have we got an ID on the vic?

32:30.400 --> 32:32.926
Alexandra Hahn,
Slocombe's girlfriend.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.081
Where's Slocombe?

32:34.200 --> 32:35.326
When we first got here, Slocombe

32:35.400 --> 32:37.243
was sitting on the stairs,
pretty out of it.

32:37.640 --> 32:41.008
Couldn't or wouldn't answer any
questions, including who he was.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.680
He had four wounds on the back of his
head, we sent him to the hospital.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.444
Any history of
domestic disturbances?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.885
No, no record of any.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.764
About 10 minutes
after we got here,

32:48.840 --> 32:50.922
next door neighbor,
Mrs. Sellers, came over.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.691
She said she heard a scream,

32:52.840 --> 32:55.491
and saw Dr. Slocombe drive off
pretty fast in his Porsche.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.365
She assumed it was just an
argument, until she saw us.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.204
Could have been
dumping evidence.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.004
We know what time
Slocombe got back?

33:02.240 --> 33:04.083
His car's not here,
and it's not on the street.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.601
Well, if Slocombe drove off,
how did he get back?

33:06.760 --> 33:09.081
Maybe he dumped the car, too,
came back in a taxi.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.600
What if there was
someone else here?

33:11.160 --> 33:12.241
We got a license
on that car?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.407
We did.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.365
I assume you want an APB?

33:15.440 --> 33:16.805
You assume correctly.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.287
Okay.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.481
Better get to the hospital,

33:19.600 --> 33:22.001
see if Dr. Slocombe has
remembered anything yet.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.889
He suffered some
pretty severe trauma.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.446
He's got four wounds
to the back of his head.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.170
The CAT scan and
the MRI show severe

33:29.240 --> 33:30.924
swelling in the
hippocampus and thalamus

33:31.000 --> 33:32.650
where the brain
stores most of its memory.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.131
All right.
Which means what?

33:34.240 --> 33:36.160
Which means I'm not surprised
he's having trouble

33:36.240 --> 33:37.924
remembering anything.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.569
You have any idea
what made the wounds?

33:45.760 --> 33:47.762
No, but I took pictures.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.928
I've never seen
anything like it.

33:57.080 --> 33:58.525
How'd you
find this place?

33:58.640 --> 34:00.802
A friend of Juliette's
is a real estate agent.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.809
I told her I wanted
a few acres that were

34:02.880 --> 34:05.690
hard to get to
and not easy to find.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.690
It has no address,
and it's not in my name.

34:13.639 --> 34:14.766
Well, somebody found it.

34:14.840 --> 34:15.887
That's Juliette's bike.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.201
You expecting her?

34:21.639 --> 34:23.641
Sorry, I wasn't sure it was you.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.920
What are you doing?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.049
I figure I better
learn as much as I can,

34:36.159 --> 34:39.004
now that, you know,
everything's changed.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.005
You rode all the way out here?

34:42.159 --> 34:44.161
It only took me two hours.
It wasn't that bad.

34:44.679 --> 34:45.841
What are you guys doing here?

34:46.639 --> 34:48.165
We got a case
we can't figure out.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.641
Wesen related?

34:50.280 --> 34:51.770
Oh, sorry, how would you know?

34:53.960 --> 34:56.281
I didn't mean it like that.
It's okay.

34:56.679 --> 34:57.681
Really?

34:57.760 --> 35:00.240
No, not really, but we've
gotta deal with this.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.642
Look, I'm glad you're here.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.361
We could use your help.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.770
All right,
what are we looking for?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.408
Some Wesen that probes
the back of your head

35:13.480 --> 35:15.050
and you can't remember anything.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.129
We've run out of time.
You need to deliver.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.124
Everything you need
is right up here.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.202
So stop threatening me.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.725
We have to prove to our client

35:34.800 --> 35:36.006
that what you're stealing

35:36.080 --> 35:37.889
is worth the fee we're asking.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.960
Give them this.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.402
This is a key piece
to the CVA project.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.322
Compliments of Henry Slocombe.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.885
Tell me about the collateral.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.084
Slocombe's girlfriend.
It was unavoidable.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.130
Did you leave it clean?
Of course.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.124
They can't tie me to anything.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.009
I just need to dump the car
and get another.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.402
Unless you would
like to buy me one.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.730
Just hurry up
and get to Vickers.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.928
And don't call me
again until it's done.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.409
And get rid of that car.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.005
Sir, stop where you are.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.009
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.881
Did I do something wrong?

36:30.120 --> 36:31.485
We need to see your ID.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.567
You the owner of this vehicle?

36:32.640 --> 36:33.687
No.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.044
No, it belongs to a friend
of mine, Henry Slocombe.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.600
He loaned it to me for the weekend.
Is there a problem?

36:43.040 --> 36:44.280
Hey,
check this one out.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.643
The Gedachtnis Esser.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.322
Looks like some
kind of memory eater.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.642
That would explain the
condition of our victim.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.008
"It is not known
how this Wesen removes

36:54.080 --> 36:56.287
"the memories of its victims,
only that it can.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.210
"I surmise it has
something to do with

36:58.320 --> 37:00.163
"the electrical charges
in the brain.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.930
"After an attack,
the victims are usually

37:02.000 --> 37:03.650
"diagnosed with
advanced dementia.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.801
"From interviewing some of these

37:04.880 --> 37:06.882
"unfortunate souls,
I can see why.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.282
"This is one of the most heinous
Wesen I have ever encountered.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.565
"They rob the victims of their
very lives by stealing their past,

37:13.640 --> 37:15.642
"and leaving them void
of any human connection,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.405
"devastating to
their loved ones,

37:17.480 --> 37:20.643
"and leaving the victim unable to
identify the attack or the attacker.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.004
"Justice within the confines of the
law is, therefore, impossible."

37:26.440 --> 37:29.011
Burkhardt. When?

37:30.320 --> 37:31.845
Okay, got it.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.527
They just picked up a suspect
driving the victim's car.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.889
It's gotta be the
Gedachtnis Wesen, right?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.880
All right, we're gonna
need you to come with us.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.088
Dr. Forrest, please dial 118.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.004
Dr. Forrest, please dial 118.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.490
Code Blue to ICU.
Code Blue to ICU.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.050
Excuse me,
O2 line up.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.606
Let's get him back.
Come on.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.880
- I'll clear the line.
- I've got no pulse.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.566
We're losing pressure.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.841
We need to break
the arrhythmia.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.809
I'm monitoring.
He's asystolic.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.008
Clear.
Pulse shocks flat.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.528
No heart activity.
We're losing him.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.447
Clear.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.211
I met Henry Slocombe through a
mutual friend, Danny Rivera.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.890
I think it was 2007.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.964
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Slocombe?

38:28.040 --> 38:29.087
Last night.

38:29.240 --> 38:32.528
His girlfriend, Alexandra, had
just returned early from a trip.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.010
They got into a bit of a fight,

38:35.080 --> 38:37.321
and I began to feel like
a third wheel so I left.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.609
I think it was
a little bit after 7:00.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.160
He lent me his car so I
could check into a hotel.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.401
What hotel?

38:43.480 --> 38:45.403
The Lucia, on Broadway.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.641
I checked out this morning

38:46.760 --> 38:48.524
and was in the process
of returning his Porsche

38:48.600 --> 38:49.840
when I got pulled in here.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.570
Can you tell me
what this is about?

38:51.840 --> 38:54.161
Dr. Slocombe was
attacked last night,

38:54.480 --> 38:55.891
and Alexandra was murdered.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.611
Oh, my God.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.491
Oh, my God.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.080
This is terrible.
They're both dead?

39:05.600 --> 39:07.409
Dr. Slocombe's still alive.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.531
He's in the hospital.
This is unbelievable.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.764
Do you have any idea who did it?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.770
We were hoping you might.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.282
Now I understand why I'm here.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.969
I must be a suspect.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.411
How can I help?

39:24.440 --> 39:26.363
We need you to write out

39:26.440 --> 39:28.488
everything you remember
about last night.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.761
Of course.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.651
You said that, that Henry is
in the hospital. Is he okay?

39:34.960 --> 39:36.240
The injury was pretty traumatic.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.560
We've been unable
to talk to him.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.801
I'd like to see him.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.844
Am I under arrest?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.286
No, sir.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.884
Thank you for your cooperation.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.240
You pick up anything?

40:00.320 --> 40:02.163
No. Not that
that means anything.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.809
Well, maybe he's
telling the truth.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.650
The car wasn't reported stolen.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.887
Well, even if he's lying,

40:07.960 --> 40:10.361
it's gonna be hard to tie him to
the crime without any fingerprints

40:10.440 --> 40:11.930
or any witnesses
that remember him.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.925
We don't even have a motive.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.243
Look, there's only
one kind of Wesen

40:17.320 --> 40:18.640
that can make
those kind of marks,

40:18.680 --> 40:21.047
and if that's not him,
we are wasting our time.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.925
Only one way to find out.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.525
Let's give him some Trubel.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.601
This is everything
that I can remember.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.484
You're free to go.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.765
But the Porsche belongs to Dr. Slocombe.
That stays with us.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.445
Of course. I understand.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.280
The Sergeant will return
all your personal belongings.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.682
Sir, if you'll follow me.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.405
What the hell are you doing?

41:21.720 --> 41:25.088
You're right outside
a police station, you idiot!

41:33.920 --> 41:35.604
It's him.
The Gedachtnis Esser?

41:35.920 --> 41:37.081
Yeah, he Woged.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.362
Gotta say, seriously
ugly in real life.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.487
All right,
you better stay with him.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.601
You have the new phone?

41:41.800 --> 41:42.847
Uh...

41:42.920 --> 41:44.126
Yep.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.640
Make sure it's turned on.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.801
It is, I got this.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
Be careful.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.641
Yeah, yeah.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.931
Clear!

42:05.640 --> 42:07.768
- No response.
- Clear!

42:08.320 --> 42:10.209
- I got no response.
- Nothing.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.401
All right, let's call it.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.051
Time of death, 1:34 p.m.
