12:07.481 --> 12:08.982
We didn't.

12:09.050 --> 12:10.250
I told them he was here.

12:10.318 --> 12:11.918
I'm not lying to cops
chasing a murder suspect.

12:11.986 --> 12:13.320
There's a limit.

12:13.387 --> 12:16.022
All right. Thank you very much, Torres.
You can go.

12:18.559 --> 12:21.328
Detective Wallowski.
My partner Detective Farr.

12:21.395 --> 12:23.496
Well, if you didn't know he
was here, what's your story?

12:23.564 --> 12:24.998
Routine canvas.

12:25.066 --> 12:27.500
We came to speak with you, the
man who discovered the body.

12:27.568 --> 12:29.002
I thought the FBI had this one.

12:29.070 --> 12:31.004
Many hands,
Dr. Lightman.

12:31.072 --> 12:32.505
You work for Anslinger?

12:32.573 --> 12:34.240
I work for the city
of Baltimore.

12:34.308 --> 12:35.675
Well, I'm not a cop,

12:35.743 --> 12:37.010
but you let the slow, fat
one go downstairs solo

12:37.078 --> 12:39.012
while you stand here
flirting with me.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.947
What did Hackman want with you?

12:41.015 --> 12:43.016
To tell me that he didn't
kill Julie Kinell.

12:43.084 --> 12:44.517
Well, actually, technically,

12:44.585 --> 12:46.519
he said he did kill her.

12:46.587 --> 12:50.523
Right, but what he meant
was, it was his fault.

12:50.591 --> 12:52.025
You had to be there.

12:52.093 --> 12:56.262
All right, he contact you
again, you let me know.

13:02.536 --> 13:03.970
[Door closes]

13:04.038 --> 13:05.972
Break it down for me, Torres.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.974
You better bloody
well be there.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.477
Routine followup call
coincidence, my ass.

13:10.544 --> 13:13.346
They knew Hackman was here.
They probably followed him.

13:13.414 --> 13:15.915
Which is why you didn't
bother lying to 'em, right?

13:15.983 --> 13:18.651
Yeah, well, they're
not working with the FBI.

13:18.719 --> 13:20.286
Her answer to that
was total deflection.

13:20.354 --> 13:23.990
Anyone here seen Foster?
Loker?

13:24.058 --> 13:25.725
Anyone?

13:26.994 --> 13:29.162
Well, don't all speak at once.

13:29.230 --> 13:31.498
And when I mentioned
Anslinger, something was up.

13:31.565 --> 13:32.999
Come on, keep up.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.501
You ever thought about
wearing sensible shoes?

13:34.568 --> 13:35.502
Definitely.

13:35.569 --> 13:37.003
What, definitely sensible?

13:37.071 --> 13:38.371
Definitely something came up
when you mentioned Anslinger.

13:38.439 --> 13:40.740
They're on Hackman's ass.

13:45.079 --> 13:48.515
Hey! You seen Foster?
Loker?

13:48.582 --> 13:50.083
When you disappeared down the
back stairs with that guy,

13:50.151 --> 13:53.386
they went the other way to where the
stairs dump out into the alley.

13:53.454 --> 13:55.155
Right.

13:55.222 --> 13:57.957
You know, I don't think those detectives
actually want to find Hackman yet.

13:58.025 --> 13:59.526
Maybe they're following
him to someone.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.528
Or something.

14:01.595 --> 14:03.963
All right, so get ahold of
this Cook fella, all right?

14:04.031 --> 14:05.465
I want a word with him.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.200
All right.
Hey, Em.

14:10.037 --> 14:11.971
And get Loker over
to a newspaper sharpish.

14:12.039 --> 14:14.974
I want everything that Julie
had on that Anslinger.

14:15.042 --> 14:16.476
Right. You want this...

14:16.544 --> 14:18.211
Oh, yeah, closed.

14:22.016 --> 14:25.418
So, I see you thought you'd
face this head on, did you?

14:25.486 --> 14:28.721
Seeing as it's actually
all my fault, right?

14:33.761 --> 14:35.361
Right, give it your
best shot, then.

14:35.429 --> 14:40.900
Well, we didn't think
that you'd be home.

14:40.968 --> 14:48.241
And...We weren't
trying to...Uh...

14:49.610 --> 14:52.846
Excuse me for feeling comfortable
enough in my own home

14:52.913 --> 14:56.015
to be with my boyfriend,

14:56.083 --> 14:57.517
who...

14:57.585 --> 15:04.190
Who...Who...
Loves her very much.

15:08.129 --> 15:10.697
And in the third
person singular, too.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.134
Cal: Hey!

15:14.201 --> 15:15.235
He got away.
Those two cops

15:15.302 --> 15:16.469
weren't even close
to catching him.

15:16.537 --> 15:17.737
Foamy enough for you?

15:17.805 --> 15:20.406
It's a little too much,
now that you mention it.

15:20.474 --> 15:21.641
Emily's lost her virginity.

15:21.709 --> 15:22.976
Lost it?

15:23.043 --> 15:24.144
Well, misplaced it, you know.

15:24.211 --> 15:26.980
Lost works,
but how do you know?

15:27.047 --> 15:28.982
I need your help on this one.

15:29.049 --> 15:30.483
What about her mother?

15:30.551 --> 15:31.851
Oh, God, no.

15:31.919 --> 15:36.956
I haven't... it's the
professional ear that I need.

15:47.568 --> 15:49.502
Oh, no. Sit down.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.004
Not you, son.

15:51.071 --> 15:55.008
Hop it, Dick... uh, Rick.

15:55.075 --> 15:58.511
I need to have a little
chat with Emily, you know?

15:58.579 --> 15:59.679
Talk to you later, Em?

15:59.747 --> 16:02.248
Not before you
talk to me first, son.

16:02.316 --> 16:03.683
Oh...

16:05.519 --> 16:07.453
Have we got any
food in the house or...

16:07.521 --> 16:08.721
I did the grocery
shopping yesterday,

16:08.789 --> 16:09.789
if that's what you mean.

16:09.857 --> 16:11.524
Ok, 'cause Foster's coming by.

16:11.592 --> 16:13.059
We're gonna have a little
bit of dinner later.

16:13.127 --> 16:14.961
We're gonna talk about
all of this then.

16:15.029 --> 16:16.963
You dragged her into this?

16:17.031 --> 16:19.699
So no beans on toast,
all right?

16:21.035 --> 16:22.402
âª Love you âª

16:22.469 --> 16:24.704
Don't forget that bit.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.878
I hired a hit man
to kill Stephen Cook?

16:31.946 --> 16:34.314
The way you just said Cook's name,
you could have been talking about...

16:34.381 --> 16:37.317
a dog turd.

16:37.384 --> 16:39.986
That's because he wants to
turn the city's projects

16:40.054 --> 16:45.225
into a yuppie, latte-drinking,
pedestrianized theme park.

16:47.995 --> 16:51.931
Look, I'm far from a good man,

16:51.999 --> 16:54.000
but I'm no murderer.

16:54.068 --> 16:59.005
And if I wanted to stop him, I would
have gotten it done a long time ago.

16:59.073 --> 17:03.376
An envelope was taken from Julie
Kinell when she was murdered.

17:03.444 --> 17:06.412
Search me. No,
I'm serious. Go ahead.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.815
Have your FBI buddies come up
here with their fine-tooth combs.

17:08.882 --> 17:11.684
Hell, have 'em go to
my house, why don't you?

17:11.752 --> 17:14.454
But in the meantime, I have an
early start in the morning.

17:14.521 --> 17:17.457
I have to go scam
a state senator at golf,

17:17.523 --> 17:18.958
and I like to hit
a bucket of balls

17:19.026 --> 17:21.694
the night before a big game.

17:24.397 --> 17:29.469
You know, I may not have
cared for your friend

17:29.536 --> 17:30.970
for reasons you well know,

17:31.038 --> 17:34.874
I do, however, sympathize
with your loss.

17:34.942 --> 17:38.411
So don't take it
out on me, sir.

17:38.479 --> 17:39.846
I've read your books.

17:39.913 --> 17:41.981
Well, if I'm really
honest, I've had some

17:42.049 --> 17:43.983
of my overeducated
young persons scan them

17:44.051 --> 17:46.486
and give me the headlines.

17:46.553 --> 17:51.491
So now I let you take my
temperature, check my pulse.

17:51.558 --> 17:53.493
Did I kill your friend?

17:53.560 --> 17:56.996
Or have I in my possession
this mystery envelope

17:57.064 --> 17:59.499
with God only knows
what garbage?

17:59.566 --> 18:03.436
Evidence you hired an ex-con
to try and kill Stephen Cook.

18:03.504 --> 18:06.406
You satisfied,
Dr. Lightman?

18:11.011 --> 18:14.881
The FBI are not my buddies.

18:14.948 --> 18:17.684
It's a business arrangement.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.893
Foster: So what exactly are
you trying to achieve, Cal?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.528
I mean, she's 17 years old.

18:28.595 --> 18:30.963
You should have had a conversation
with her when she was, like, 15.

18:31.031 --> 18:34.200
My dad talked to me
when I was 14.

18:37.037 --> 18:38.971
Give us your bag.

18:39.039 --> 18:40.073
Why?

18:40.140 --> 18:42.709
Where's that thing
I gave you last week?

18:51.051 --> 18:53.219
[Footsteps]

19:16.276 --> 19:19.445
Woman: Aah! Aah!

19:19.513 --> 19:21.681
[Groaning]

19:24.518 --> 19:26.386
What are you doing in my house?

19:26.453 --> 19:28.955
Where's my daughter?

19:29.022 --> 19:30.837
Emily!

19:33.057 --> 19:34.391
We're looking for
a murder suspect.

19:35.058 --> 19:35.992
Emily!

19:37.059 --> 19:38.994
What, so you just
break into his house?

19:39.061 --> 19:40.729
That crazy son of a bitch!

19:42.064 --> 19:43.732
Ohh!

19:45.568 --> 19:48.503
We wanted to talk to
Dr. Lightman some more.

19:48.571 --> 19:51.006
Door was open. Lights were out.
We were of course concerned.

19:51.073 --> 19:52.507
Oh, the door was open, was it?

19:52.575 --> 19:54.009
What I said.

19:54.076 --> 19:55.510
Yeah, as you lie
through your teeth.

19:55.578 --> 19:57.012
File a complaint.

19:57.079 --> 19:59.347
2 cops looking
for a murder suspect

19:59.415 --> 20:01.850
enter a house where they think
the occupants are in danger.

20:01.918 --> 20:03.151
Good luck with that.

20:03.219 --> 20:04.519
[Door opens]

20:04.587 --> 20:07.022
Where the bloody hell you been?

20:07.089 --> 20:09.024
At the store.
I forgot the oregano.

20:09.091 --> 20:11.927
Right. When you left,
did you leave the door open?

20:11.994 --> 20:13.528
No, I wouldn't do that.

20:13.596 --> 20:15.530
Right. You see that?
You see that?

20:15.598 --> 20:17.532
That was the truth, that was.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.034
So you was looking
for something, were you?

20:19.101 --> 20:20.535
An envelope?

20:20.603 --> 20:22.537
Foster: The contents of which
could put your councilman friend

20:22.605 --> 20:24.039
behind bars for life.

20:24.106 --> 20:26.041
Excuse me.
How do you figure that?

20:26.108 --> 20:27.542
Apart from the look
on your face, you mean?

20:27.610 --> 20:29.544
And the raise in
pitch in your voice

20:29.612 --> 20:31.046
from fear to surprise.

20:31.113 --> 20:33.448
Oh, and for your next trick?

20:33.516 --> 20:35.483
We're done here.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.285
Let's go, Wallowski.

20:39.555 --> 20:41.790
I've got your number.

20:46.629 --> 20:48.463
Well, blink,
and you miss it, right?

20:48.531 --> 20:50.065
I mean, you didn't
blink, did you?

20:50.132 --> 20:52.067
Not even a whisper of denial,

20:52.134 --> 20:53.568
like they got done what
they needed to do.

20:53.636 --> 20:56.071
Convince us that
they work for Anslinger.

20:56.138 --> 20:59.074
This will have to happen
another night, all right?

20:59.141 --> 21:00.508
What was for dinner?

21:00.576 --> 21:02.744
Roast, Emily. To go.

21:08.084 --> 21:11.019
Journalist is murdered, and they just
hand over all their files to you, huh?

21:11.087 --> 21:13.021
You underestimate
the Loker charm.

21:13.089 --> 21:15.423
Or overestimate the cops.

21:15.491 --> 21:20.028
It's the first of 17 boxes.
Want to help?

21:20.096 --> 21:21.529
What?

21:21.597 --> 21:24.766
Just seems a little
too easy is all.

21:26.535 --> 21:30.438
Right. Ok. So it's not like
I did good or anything.

21:37.613 --> 21:39.280
Man:
Agent Reynolds?

21:40.616 --> 21:42.550
Miss Torres.

21:42.618 --> 21:44.152
Mr. Cook sends
his regards,

21:44.220 --> 21:47.022
but regrets that at this
time he's unavailable.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.556
Mister...

21:48.624 --> 21:49.958
Ford. Harry.

21:50.026 --> 21:52.494
Mr. Cook can't make
time for the FBI?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.062
A little over a week ago,

21:54.130 --> 21:56.064
Mr. Cook was woken up
in the middle of the night

21:56.132 --> 21:58.066
by a recently released
convicted murderer

21:58.134 --> 22:00.335
who was sticking a gun in his mouth.
You understand?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.003
He has good reason
to believe there is

22:02.071 --> 22:03.938
a specific and imminent
threat to his life.

22:04.006 --> 22:05.740
You mean councilman Anslinger.

22:05.808 --> 22:07.509
I didn't say that.

22:07.576 --> 22:11.513
No disrespect, Harry, but actually you did...
With your face.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.916
If Mr. Cook is serious about
eliminating this threat to his life,

22:14.984 --> 22:17.519
we're gonna need
his help. In person.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.454
He even in town?

22:19.522 --> 22:21.456
Look, I'm not at liberty to...

22:21.524 --> 22:23.525
he's in town.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.461
Oh. In the building.

22:26.529 --> 22:28.930
Well, we'd really
appreciate his help,

22:28.998 --> 22:32.267
and I think he'd
appreciate ours.

22:39.241 --> 22:41.042
You see that leather
couch out there?

22:41.110 --> 22:43.044
Top dollar I paid for that

22:43.112 --> 22:45.947
to keep people
like you comfortable

22:46.015 --> 22:48.483
while they're waiting.

22:48.551 --> 22:52.153
We have an urgent situation
we'd like you to look into.

22:52.221 --> 22:55.790
A civil war reenactor on federal
land was just found dead.

22:57.126 --> 22:57.992
Really?

22:58.060 --> 22:59.561
That's fascinating, this,

22:59.628 --> 23:01.830
but I'm a little
busy right now.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.499
You're trampling all over
an ongoing investigation

23:04.567 --> 23:07.502
involving multiple
undercover agents

23:07.570 --> 23:09.003
and thousands of man hours.

23:09.071 --> 23:12.507
Which my friend got
caught in the middle of

23:12.575 --> 23:15.510
and then ended up dead.

23:15.578 --> 23:17.445
So where was all your
man hours then, eh?

23:17.513 --> 23:21.349
You'll accompany Agent
Reynolds to Fredericksburg.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.753
Don't, and your relationship
with the bureau's over.

23:30.092 --> 23:32.527
Let me ask you something.

23:32.595 --> 23:34.028
2 years ago,
when you flagged him

23:34.096 --> 23:36.030
in that security
clearance interview,

23:36.098 --> 23:40.034
that was based on a genuine
scientific reading, right?

23:40.102 --> 23:42.937
You know, sometimes, Ben...

23:43.005 --> 23:46.541
It's just a feeling.

23:46.609 --> 23:47.742
A feeling.

23:47.810 --> 23:49.043
[Cell phone rings]

23:49.111 --> 23:50.044
Yeah.

23:50.112 --> 23:52.046
[Ring]

23:52.114 --> 23:53.281
Yep.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.986
Yeah, I know it.
Yeah.

23:58.053 --> 24:00.555
Yeah, I'll be there.

24:00.623 --> 24:02.724
Send me a post card
from Fredericksburg!

24:04.860 --> 24:07.228
[Indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

24:08.564 --> 24:11.499
Man: Making stops at
Charlottesville, Greenboro,

24:11.567 --> 24:14.736
Atlanta, Birmingham, and ...

24:49.104 --> 24:50.538
Woman: Oh!

24:50.606 --> 24:52.774
Is he all right?

24:56.111 --> 24:57.545
Reynolds: Move! Move!

24:57.613 --> 24:59.981
Watch it! Watch it!

25:00.049 --> 25:01.482
FBI!

25:01.550 --> 25:02.984
Uhh! Ohh!

25:03.052 --> 25:03.985
[People screaming]

25:04.053 --> 25:05.220
Uhh!

25:21.003 --> 25:23.905
Why'd you follow me here,
you bloody idiot?

25:35.190 --> 25:36.857
[Police radio]

25:45.200 --> 25:47.067
You made him wear a wire?

25:47.135 --> 25:49.369
You didn't like the look of me.

25:50.638 --> 25:53.006
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you coming?

25:53.074 --> 25:55.142
Now you think I'm on the
councilman's payroll,

25:55.210 --> 25:56.643
or is that just a feeling, too?

25:56.711 --> 25:58.212
Now I remember you.

25:58.279 --> 26:00.581
You could never answer a simple
question with a simple answer.

26:00.648 --> 26:02.015
Ask the question.
Go ahead. Right now.

26:02.083 --> 26:03.450
It's too late for that, mate.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.818
Why?

26:06.154 --> 26:08.088
Just got personal between us.

26:08.156 --> 26:10.090
Whose fault is that?

26:10.158 --> 26:12.593
A wire?
Is that even legal?

26:12.660 --> 26:14.494
Reynolds chose
to wear that wire.

26:14.562 --> 26:16.864
I didn't order him to do it.

26:16.931 --> 26:20.100
He wanted to prove that your beef
with me was based in science...

26:20.168 --> 26:22.102
science that you believed
in, right or wrong,

26:22.170 --> 26:24.104
that it was nothing
more than that

26:24.172 --> 26:26.106
before I suspended
your FBI contract

26:26.174 --> 26:29.843
and opened an investigation
into your entire life.

26:31.112 --> 26:34.348
I'll let you know how it
went from the hospital.

26:38.186 --> 26:39.620
You hear about Reynolds?

26:39.687 --> 26:41.622
Yeah. Figure the best
thing I could do for him

26:41.689 --> 26:43.957
is just stay on top of this.
Are you ok?

26:44.025 --> 26:46.059
Hey. How is he doing?

26:46.127 --> 26:47.461
Lightman: He's hanging on
by a thread.

26:47.528 --> 26:48.795
Loker:
Is that what they said?

26:48.863 --> 26:50.030
Not in so many words, no.

26:50.098 --> 26:51.632
He's in surgery.

26:51.699 --> 26:53.367
Reynolds is a fighter.

26:56.804 --> 26:58.805
Was this your fault?

26:59.908 --> 27:03.076
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

27:03.144 --> 27:05.312
that came out wrong.

27:07.081 --> 27:10.083
Dillon: Is there anything in
Kinell's research I should see?

27:10.151 --> 27:12.920
Not if the FBI is
as good as she was.

27:12.987 --> 27:14.421
What about Cook?

27:14.489 --> 27:16.156
I don't think he's gonna
show his face anywhere

27:16.224 --> 27:19.993
until he believes this threat to
his life has been dealt with.

27:20.061 --> 27:21.495
He's here.

27:21.562 --> 27:22.996
Eh?

27:23.064 --> 27:24.998
Mr. Cook. Sorry.
Should have knocked.

27:25.066 --> 27:26.533
He just got here.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.102
Uh, right, Anna, call
Foster at the hospital.

27:29.170 --> 27:31.605
I want her ear
for this one. Wait!

27:31.673 --> 27:34.041
Stall Cook.

27:34.108 --> 27:36.543
We'll do this in the lab.

27:36.611 --> 27:40.047
All right, Bernard,
you're in here, mate.

27:40.114 --> 27:42.115
Make out like you're going to
interview him or something.

27:42.183 --> 27:43.550
Why?

27:43.618 --> 27:46.620
Because you're going
to interview him or something.

27:46.688 --> 27:48.555
You do want to verify the story

27:48.623 --> 27:51.058
that Hackman shoved the gun
in his mouth, don't you?

27:51.125 --> 27:52.559
You don't believe that?

27:52.627 --> 27:57.564
Well, I don't really believe
anything I've been told so far.

27:57.632 --> 28:01.301
You know, it's all been
just a bit convenient.

28:02.570 --> 28:04.304
Or hadn't you noticed?

28:07.041 --> 28:08.575
Anger.

28:08.643 --> 28:11.578
Happiness.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.080
Tonya harding.

28:13.147 --> 28:14.581
Ha.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.083
And here she is.

28:16.150 --> 28:17.584
Dr. Foster,
Mr. Cook.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.019
Hey.
Hi.

28:19.087 --> 28:20.487
How's Agent Reynolds?

28:20.555 --> 28:22.089
He's in the best
possible hands.

28:22.156 --> 28:23.824
Thanks, Anna.

28:29.163 --> 28:31.098
Very impressive.

28:31.165 --> 28:34.534
What are you doing down
this way, Stephen?

28:34.602 --> 28:37.104
I'm told that the FBI
agent who was shot today

28:37.171 --> 28:40.107
is the same agent who came
by my offices last night

28:40.174 --> 28:42.342
asking for my help.

28:44.979 --> 28:47.614
What's that about?

28:47.682 --> 28:49.116
Fear.

28:49.183 --> 28:50.550
No, that was sadness.

28:50.618 --> 28:52.619
That's more where that landed.

28:52.687 --> 28:55.122
Why not build your mall somewhere
else, in another city?

28:55.189 --> 28:58.125
I was born and raised
in Baltimore.

28:58.192 --> 28:59.993
The city's been going
to the dogs for years.

29:00.061 --> 29:01.561
I'm doing something about it,

29:01.629 --> 29:05.298
as I break down the walls of
corruption that that man has built.

29:10.138 --> 29:11.571
You knew that man.

29:11.639 --> 29:13.073
In a manner of speaking.

29:13.141 --> 29:14.574
I think you know the story.

29:14.642 --> 29:16.576
Did you know about
an envelope of evidence

29:16.644 --> 29:20.080
that he had against Anslinger?

29:20.148 --> 29:21.581
Envelope?

29:21.649 --> 29:23.450
You should really see
your eyebrows right now.

29:23.518 --> 29:26.586
Ha ha! Ok, you got me.

29:26.654 --> 29:29.589
I know.
I have my sources.

29:29.657 --> 29:33.093
Is it the cops? The FBI?

29:33.161 --> 29:39.633
Not the FBI, I mean, not so far as
special Agent Dillon is aware of anyway.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.803
So what, did the cops tell you
about the envelope, did they?

29:42.870 --> 29:45.105
Have you searched
Anslinger's office,

29:45.173 --> 29:48.809
his house, his condo?

29:48.876 --> 29:52.145
Oh, you just scared the
pants off my mate Bernard.

29:52.213 --> 29:54.047
You know, Julie Kinell
knew about that, too,

29:54.115 --> 29:56.116
about Anslinger's condo,

29:56.184 --> 29:58.051
his secret fornicatorium
at the harbor.

29:58.119 --> 30:01.354
That's where he went to
fornicate with hookers.

30:02.890 --> 30:06.126
I think Anslinger's got something
personal against Mr. Cook here.

30:06.194 --> 30:08.361
You gotta find that
for me, will you?

30:17.638 --> 30:24.578
I'm not even gonna ask why you
failed to mention the condo.

30:24.645 --> 30:29.149
For all I know, you're getting a
slice of action off the hookers.

30:29.217 --> 30:31.151
Oh?

30:31.219 --> 30:33.086
And then some.

30:33.154 --> 30:37.390
I think we're finally getting
on the same page, you and I.

30:39.127 --> 30:43.096
I'll start with what
is hiding in that condo.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.401
What if there isn't anything?

30:49.737 --> 30:51.404
There is.

30:53.741 --> 30:57.410
What if it has nothing to do
with the murder of your friend?

31:10.527 --> 31:12.695
[Monitor beeping]

31:19.035 --> 31:21.971
How come you never
told me about Julie?

31:22.038 --> 31:24.206
[Staff talking indistinctly]

31:25.475 --> 31:28.210
Well, there's nothing
much to tell, really.

31:31.982 --> 31:33.983
I've been watching you
grieve for your friend

31:34.050 --> 31:36.485
for the last 36 hours.

31:36.553 --> 31:39.989
Well, she wanted to be a little
bit more than a friend, you know.

31:40.056 --> 31:41.924
Know what I mean?

31:41.992 --> 31:44.226
I'm sorry.

31:51.568 --> 31:52.735
All right.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.940
Will you make sure
Cook's there, too?

31:58.008 --> 32:00.175
Ok.

32:28.972 --> 32:30.873
Anslinger: I want it on record
that I'm here on my own free will.

32:30.941 --> 32:33.475
Foster: This isn't a court
or a police station.

32:33.543 --> 32:34.977
There is no record.

32:35.045 --> 32:36.979
And no right to remain silent.

32:37.047 --> 32:38.981
Well, it would be a bit
of a waste of time,

32:39.049 --> 32:41.984
coming all the way down here of your
own free will just to remain silent.

32:42.052 --> 32:43.919
You had the FBI search
my offices and my house.

32:43.987 --> 32:46.989
And your condo.
Don't forget your condo.

32:47.057 --> 32:49.491
What did Loker
call it again? The...

32:49.559 --> 32:52.127
Fornicatorium at the harbor.

32:52.195 --> 32:54.430
Ok, my private life
has nothing to do with...

32:54.497 --> 32:57.166
let's talk about the 14th
amendment for a sec, shall we?

32:57.233 --> 32:58.934
Referring to
the right to privacy.

32:59.002 --> 33:01.370
Even more of a gray area
in there.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.538
Want me to explain?

33:02.605 --> 33:03.973
[Door opens]

33:04.040 --> 33:07.343
Hey, guys. The FBI found something
in the councilman's condo.

33:07.410 --> 33:10.212
Oh. Let me guess.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.448
Uh, sex toys?

33:12.515 --> 33:14.950
Oh, something worse.

33:15.018 --> 33:16.952
Much worse, right?

33:17.020 --> 33:20.956
Something bad.
Something naughty.

33:21.024 --> 33:22.891
Yeah. Perverted.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.693
I can't wait.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.706
A shredder?

33:37.774 --> 33:40.476
The agents who did the
search are waiting outside

33:40.543 --> 33:41.977
if you want to talk to them.

33:42.045 --> 33:43.912
So am I supposed to
unshred all of this?

33:43.980 --> 33:45.981
Don't you have FBI
people who, like,

33:46.049 --> 33:48.484
this is what they do all day?

33:51.054 --> 33:52.421
Hi.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.190
Haven't you got bodyguards or
something out there, Stephen?

33:55.258 --> 33:58.160
The only protection worth paying
for is the kind you can't see.

33:58.228 --> 34:00.262
You do know that the councilman's
here, though, right?

34:00.330 --> 34:01.897
That's why I'm here.

34:01.965 --> 34:04.666
Thank you so much for coming back.
Right this way.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.175
Guess who owns the paper
Julie Kinell worked for.

34:14.511 --> 34:18.447
Did you manage to
find that personal link

34:18.514 --> 34:22.384
between those 2 men that
I asked you for earlier?

34:22.452 --> 34:23.952
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:24.020 --> 34:29.824
You were waiting for some kind
of high five thing, were you?

34:29.893 --> 34:33.962
I'd start with Anslinger's
time as a cop, if I were you.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.197
Follow me, Bernard.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.969
Huh!

34:41.036 --> 34:42.971
What is this place?

34:43.039 --> 34:46.208
This is where we do
some of our best work.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.483
Is this really necessary?

34:54.551 --> 34:57.386
Well, you wanted
your pound of flesh, right?

35:04.994 --> 35:07.429
Right. I want
a good dirty fight.

35:07.497 --> 35:08.931
Plenty of hits below the belt,

35:08.998 --> 35:11.667
you know, the more the merrier.

35:18.859 --> 35:20.292
You hired that ex-con
to kill me.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.294
Why would I do that?

35:23.362 --> 35:26.297
They found the evidence
in your condo,

35:26.365 --> 35:28.299
the one where
you take your whores.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.301
Oh, that was a gear shift.

35:30.369 --> 35:33.304
Evidence?
What evidence?

35:33.372 --> 35:35.306
[Door buzzes]

35:35.374 --> 35:36.541
Right.

35:38.878 --> 35:42.814
He has absolutely no idea
what they found in his condo.

35:42.882 --> 35:46.317
So, go on, tell him.
Go on.

35:46.385 --> 35:47.819
A shredder.

35:47.887 --> 35:49.554
They found a shredder.

35:51.090 --> 35:55.827
You see that?
That was relief that was.

35:55.895 --> 35:58.263
Right.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.598
What about the whips
and the gas masks,

36:00.666 --> 36:03.268
the size 11 stiletto pumps?

36:03.335 --> 36:05.270
Yeah? Right.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.705
That was shame.

36:07.773 --> 36:09.774
I mean, that's what
he was hiding in the condo,

36:09.842 --> 36:11.209
not a bloody shredder.

36:11.277 --> 36:13.278
I don't even own a shredder.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.280
True enough.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.182
Is your blood starting
to boil a little bit?

36:17.249 --> 36:18.983
Excuse me? For what?

36:19.051 --> 36:21.786
You had everything
point at him.

36:21.854 --> 36:24.289
It made perfect sense.

36:24.356 --> 36:27.225
Ex-cop, politician hires
ex-con to kill rival.

36:27.293 --> 36:29.227
I'm a businessman,
not a rival politician.

36:29.295 --> 36:30.728
You're a billionaire, mate.

36:30.796 --> 36:32.297
I mean, it's the only
power that matters.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.299
How much did you
pay those 2 detectives?

36:34.366 --> 36:36.734
How much did you
pay Hackman to kill Julie?

36:36.802 --> 36:39.804
I didn't come here to
be spoken to like this.

36:39.872 --> 36:41.306
[Turns handle] Open the door.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.308
It was a very clever move,

36:43.375 --> 36:45.743
having Hackman tell me
that he killed Julie up front.

36:45.811 --> 36:47.745
That's hiding the
truth within the truth,

36:47.813 --> 36:49.314
and that's very tricky.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.316
You had me going for a bit.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.318
Now, the envelope
was just bait, right,

36:53.385 --> 36:54.819
to get Julie in the hotel room

36:54.887 --> 36:57.055
where you had Hackman kill her?

36:57.122 --> 36:59.324
You even sent us to his condo,

36:59.391 --> 37:01.259
where you planted a shredder.

37:01.327 --> 37:03.494
Open the door.

37:03.562 --> 37:06.598
You own the newspaper
Julie worked for.

37:06.665 --> 37:09.267
You made it look like
he had her killed.

37:09.335 --> 37:10.768
You did the same with Hackman.

37:10.836 --> 37:14.772
Almost killing another friend of
mine in the process, by the way.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.274
For what reason,
some kind of rivalry?

37:16.342 --> 37:19.010
You already said
I have all the power I need.

37:20.779 --> 37:24.182
Let's talk about this
for a minute.

37:24.250 --> 37:27.285
It's a Baltimore DUI

37:27.353 --> 37:31.522
that you got from
him 20 years ago.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.797
This isn't just
about a ticket, is it?

37:39.865 --> 37:42.533
This is about something else.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.704
You're that guy?

37:46.772 --> 37:50.241
This is about that?
This is about her... what's-her-name?

37:50.309 --> 37:51.976
She couldn't wait
to be with a real man.

37:52.044 --> 37:53.811
She just needed me to show her.

37:53.879 --> 37:55.813
We were gonna be married.

37:55.881 --> 37:57.348
She was my whole life.

37:57.416 --> 38:00.685
She was the passenger in your car
which you were driving drunk.

38:00.753 --> 38:02.253
I wasn't drunk!

38:02.321 --> 38:04.689
Oh, I think you remember
this like it was yesterday.

38:04.757 --> 38:06.257
You'd had a few, right?

38:06.325 --> 38:08.760
He thought it would be
fun to arrest my fiancee

38:08.827 --> 38:11.262
on some fictional
prostitution allegations.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.766
He insults her, gropes her, cuffs
her, then he takes her away.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.769
What did you do about it, eh?

38:17.836 --> 38:19.270
Eh?

38:19.338 --> 38:21.272
Nothing.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.508
Sod all.

38:27.846 --> 38:32.517
What did you do with
the fiancee after?

38:34.853 --> 38:38.289
I took her home.
We dated for a while.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.791
It was good while it lasted.

38:39.858 --> 38:41.292
Shut up.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.795
Am I proud of it?
If I had my life to do over,

38:43.862 --> 38:46.030
would I do it again?

38:48.867 --> 38:50.535
Uhh!

38:54.373 --> 38:55.807
[Pounding on door]

38:55.874 --> 38:58.242
Dillon: Open the door,
Lightman!

38:58.310 --> 39:02.180
You see that?
You see that?

39:02.247 --> 39:05.750
Do you ever read any of my
friend Julie's work, eh?

39:05.818 --> 39:07.251
Eh?

39:07.319 --> 39:10.755
Have you got any idea what sort
of woman is it you killed?

39:10.823 --> 39:12.056
[Pounding on door]

39:12.124 --> 39:14.759
Dillon: Open the door,
Lightman.

39:14.827 --> 39:20.264
This is a woman that went off to
Iraq during the shock and awe show

39:20.332 --> 39:22.266
and refused to
imbed with the troops.

39:22.334 --> 39:23.768
[Pounding on door]

39:23.836 --> 39:25.203
Dillon: Lightman,
this has gone too far!

39:25.270 --> 39:29.507
I mean, it just doesn't
happen anymore.

39:33.846 --> 39:36.514
Dillon: Lightman,
this ends now!

39:41.854 --> 39:43.688
Let him go, councilman.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.523
It's over.

39:48.861 --> 39:50.528
[Coughing]

39:57.870 --> 40:00.738
And you call yourself a man?

40:00.806 --> 40:04.542
That's what she said, eh?
Your fiancee?

40:05.878 --> 40:08.046
Get him out of
my sight, Bernard.

40:12.384 --> 40:16.821
A billionaire.
The only power that matters?

40:16.889 --> 40:19.557
Not in my town.

40:35.107 --> 40:37.575
That's all about you, that is.

40:39.778 --> 40:44.082
I think you know full well I'm not
gonna let Julie's work go to waste.

40:45.918 --> 40:47.351
So...

40:47.419 --> 40:49.754
You and I...

40:49.822 --> 40:52.590
We're gonna get to
know each other very well.

41:03.302 --> 41:07.205
There's something you got
to understand, right, Em?

41:07.272 --> 41:09.807
I was Rick's age once, right?

41:09.875 --> 41:11.142
Look, give me a break,
all right?

41:11.210 --> 41:13.311
'Cause I'm making this
up as I go along, right?

41:13.378 --> 41:15.313
So just give me a break.

41:15.380 --> 41:16.814
Ok.

41:16.882 --> 41:18.316
All right.

41:18.383 --> 41:20.551
My point is...

41:21.820 --> 41:24.222
That he can't control himself.

41:24.289 --> 41:26.324
It's not possible.

41:26.391 --> 41:27.725
You might think that he is

41:27.793 --> 41:30.828
the most amazing bloke that
you've ever met in your life,

41:30.896 --> 41:32.763
and you may be right.

41:32.831 --> 41:36.834
But I'm telling you for a fact,

41:36.902 --> 41:39.337
that...

41:39.404 --> 41:42.840
Rick, along with every other
teenage boy out there,

41:42.908 --> 41:45.743
is gonna promise you
just about anything.

41:45.811 --> 41:47.845
I mean, he's willing
to say almost anything...

41:47.913 --> 41:49.514
to get in my pants?

41:49.581 --> 41:51.849
This is not a joke.

41:51.917 --> 41:54.852
Em, this is not a joke.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.788
Rick and I never
actually did it, dad.

41:57.856 --> 42:01.792
But you said... "this is just sex.
" You said that.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.794
You said, "dad,
this is just sex."

42:03.862 --> 42:05.530
I was mad at you.

42:07.299 --> 42:12.537
So...That's
the good news.

42:14.773 --> 42:17.542
What's the bad news, then, Em?

42:19.378 --> 42:21.045
2 boyfriends ago.

42:23.882 --> 42:25.550
Really?

42:27.886 --> 42:29.554
You ok?

42:30.889 --> 42:32.557
No.

42:34.893 --> 42:38.829
I mean, yeah, you know.

42:38.897 --> 42:41.065
But not really.

42:48.907 --> 42:50.575
Come here.

42:52.911 --> 42:54.679
You know why I trust you.

42:54.746 --> 42:58.216
Yeah, 'cause you're smart.

42:58.283 --> 43:00.785
And you're a great dad,

43:00.852 --> 43:03.521
and what other
choice do you have?

43:04.856 --> 43:06.023
Yeah.

43:11.863 --> 43:13.297
Come here, Em.
