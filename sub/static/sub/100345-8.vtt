00:32.720 --> 00:35.600
How long do you think
he intends to just sit there ?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.360
Until we are convinced it was him.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.520
Have you noticed that he makes no
claim of responsibility for the attack ?

00:43.680 --> 00:48.800
- That's unprecedented on their part.
- Okay, he convinced me.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.640
It was him.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.320
When you don't have proof,
you don't have proof.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.920
Why did you set Essence
on Sofia Dubois ?

00:58.600 --> 01:02.080
Essence is a ghostly figure,
he knows how to point the way.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
Nice move !

01:04.239 --> 01:09.360
You wanted the terrible triad
to crash and burn, but I did instead.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.520
- Fortunately, I landed on flowers.
- A temporary and calculated set back.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.120
The terrible triad
will be crashed even more,

01:20.480 --> 01:22.360
and you'll be right back in there.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.000
It's time to take stock,
Your Eminence.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.440
You will have to direct
your questions elsewhere.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.440
I am a floriculturist now.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.000
And I am, at least officially,
propertyless.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.760
Yet I manage a large part of the world
out of my hotel room.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.400
I'm sure you do the same
from your glass house here.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.960
I don't manage a thing, Bauer.
I merely offer advice, now and then.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.000
Much heeded advice,
it would seem.

01:51.320 --> 01:56.040
Sofia leaked some photos of the young
Brannox to an English newspaper.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.560
Did you know
he was a pathetic punk

02:00.720 --> 02:03.560
who hug around
other losers just like himself ?

02:03.840 --> 02:07.280
What a scoop !
Let's see where it leads.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.240
A brilliant move.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.840
The world needs to feel some
tenderness toward our current pontiff.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.160
No, the world needs to forget
about the other one !

02:17.240 --> 02:20.600
Which is why we have to help
John Paul III.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.760
He is weak and unresponsive.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.760
What are you worried about,
exactly ?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.120
Exactly what am I ?

02:35.480 --> 02:36.520
You don't know !

02:39.960 --> 02:41.480
You don't know !

02:44.400 --> 02:48.160
Okay...
The way he acted in that interview ?

02:50.040 --> 02:54.480
He was in withdrawal, Voiello.
He is a drug addict.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.440
I am unacquainted
with addictive behavior.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.040
Except regarding Napoli.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.960
Spalletta's known for years, that's how
he has been blackmailing him.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.160
You're slipping, Voiello.
You are seriously uninformed.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.960
Brannox is a lazy,
self-centered coward.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.840
He let things fall apart.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.600
Now the evil triad has the run of the
roost in business and in perversion.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.640
Always and exclusively illegal.

03:27.720 --> 03:32.040
Sooner or later, some reporter
will get a whiff of the stench,

03:32.120 --> 03:34.560
and it'll all blow sky high.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.920
We've reached the point of no return,
my friend.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.520
We can't keep piling problems
on other problems.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
We can't.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.200
But I will need your approval first.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.600
I need to think about it.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.160
Think fast please.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.200
We need the Vatican strong again,
right now.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.240
Probability calculation and history
are both against you.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.560
There will be another attack,
you can count on that.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.440
And there will be
a proliferation of sex scandals,

04:20.519 --> 04:23.760
dozens more, given the fact
that truth, for some people,

04:24.480 --> 04:26.880
is an ineradicable vice.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.880
I need to go now.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.000
But first, let me tell you
two more things that will surprise you.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.320
Don't you think you've surprised me
enough for one day ?

04:40.440 --> 04:41.480
No.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.240
Number one:
Francis II, that wasn't us.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.440
We got there too late.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.600
Falsehood is my own ineradicable vice.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.200
Therefore, I would beg you
not to inform me

04:57.440 --> 04:59.840
of any covered operations.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.240
You will be interested in this, alright.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.320
It was Lenny Belardo.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.840
What are you saying ?

05:10.640 --> 05:15.760
Lenny Belardo, in a coma,
inexplicably moves his finger,

05:16.120 --> 05:19.760
and two seconds later,
Francis II is dead.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.360
We ran a crosscheck
on the times.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.160
It was a miracle, Voiello.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.640
And the second surprise ?
Another miracle, I suppose ?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.280
Exactly.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.200
Lenny Belardo is woken up.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.160
And he's coming back.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.720
Bye Voiello !

08:14.880 --> 08:18.360
We prepared
a few surprises for you.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.880
Cherry Coke Zero, Your Holiness.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.720
Your favorite drink.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.120
He used to hide.
Now he shows his face.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.040
Just like you, Your Holiness.

09:19.472 --> 09:23.032
I'm not going to tell you who we are,
and neither will you attorney.

09:23.592 --> 09:28.472
I will ask you this only once.
Then I'm gonna count to seven.

09:29.552 --> 09:32.872
By the time I reach seven,
I expect an answer.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.632
I'm not a huge fan of suspense,
so I'd kindly ask you

09:36.752 --> 09:41.832
to let me have an answer by the time
I reach four, at very most five.

09:42.232 --> 09:45.592
I'm not gonna tell you what will happen
if I have to count up to 7

09:45.672 --> 09:46.912
for two reasons.

09:47.112 --> 09:50.672
One: even a prisoner
has the right to surprise.

09:50.832 --> 09:54.432
Two: I seldom make threats.

09:55.352 --> 10:00.232
Threats are a vulgar tool
in the hands of organized crime.

10:00.312 --> 10:03.552
And we are not criminals.
That's our perception, at least,

10:03.632 --> 10:07.872
and perception, my dear Faisal,
is everything.

10:09.152 --> 10:13.112
All the rest is the prerogative
of that monotony

10:13.272 --> 10:16.432
simpletons insist
on calling "reality".

10:17.672 --> 10:23.712
At any rate, my question
is disconcertingly simple.

10:25.712 --> 10:30.272
Was it you ?

10:33.672 --> 10:34.752
One,

10:36.792 --> 10:37.872
two,

10:39.032 --> 10:40.112
three,

10:40.912 --> 10:42.072
four.

10:50.192 --> 10:54.472
As far as I'm concerned,
that's an answer.

10:56.472 --> 10:57.592
Is he here ?

11:00.672 --> 11:01.832
- Who ?
- The pope ?

11:03.632 --> 11:07.512
- John Paul III, I mean.
- No, he left.

11:07.712 --> 11:10.752
- Where did he go ?
- To another Vatican property.

11:11.272 --> 11:13.592
Eminence, please,
might you be a little more precise ?

11:13.912 --> 11:16.632
The Vatican owns
more than 100 000 properties.

11:17.832 --> 11:20.512
To a chalet in the Dolomites.

11:22.712 --> 11:23.752
Have you seen him ?

11:24.872 --> 11:26.392
- Who ?
- Pius XIII.

11:28.952 --> 11:30.992
- Not yet.
- What do you think ?

11:34.432 --> 11:35.592
I was expecting this.

11:38.872 --> 11:39.952
Catch me if you can.

11:52.272 --> 11:58.552
I am aware that you had a rather
privileged relationship with Pius XIII.

11:59.832 --> 12:02.072
I advise you not to renew it.

12:03.432 --> 12:07.352
For the moment,
Pius XIII must be kept in isolation,

12:08.362 --> 12:15.122
and it is not necessary that he have
any contact with the cardinals.

12:16.107 --> 12:17.427
That is all, Gutierrez.

12:24.524 --> 12:25.684
How is your toy boy ?

12:30.032 --> 12:33.952
His name is Freddie,
and I think he is fine.

12:38.352 --> 12:39.472
Did he leave you ?

12:43.352 --> 12:44.992
I deduce that he has.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.512
Have you read
my most recent circular ?

12:50.992 --> 12:54.632
Severe measures will be taken
against anyone engaging

12:54.792 --> 12:59.592
in questionable
or unseemly relations.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.432
I read it and complied.

13:03.112 --> 13:04.152
Did you ?

13:30.672 --> 13:31.792
You have a visitor.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.712
Death does not announce his arrival,
so who is it ?

13:37.792 --> 13:38.872
It's a form of life.

13:40.672 --> 13:43.032
- Sofia Dubois.
- No.

13:44.912 --> 13:47.712
- I suggest "yes".
- Why Danny ?

13:47.992 --> 13:51.752
Because this is your chance to return
to what you have always been.

13:52.952 --> 13:54.472
- A failure ?
- No.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.952
A seductive man.

14:09.632 --> 14:12.392
- How is Voiello ?
- Suffering.

14:12.672 --> 14:15.672
Voiello's only concern
is for the good of the Church.

14:16.072 --> 14:20.512
Good for the Church may not coincide
with what is good for me.

14:21.712 --> 14:27.512
Please, Holy Father. Voiello is good.
It's the others who are bad.

14:27.592 --> 14:32.392
You have to believe me, seeing as how
my husband is one of the bad ones.

14:40.072 --> 14:43.392
I'm going to do something
incredibly intimate, Holy Father.

14:53.552 --> 14:54.592
Close your eyes.

15:07.592 --> 15:08.672
What are you doing ?

15:10.352 --> 15:13.312
Trying to make you feel
like you're back at your castle.

15:16.032 --> 15:21.192
The thing I miss about my castle
is the sense of imprisonment,

15:22.192 --> 15:23.712
that others call freedom.

15:26.472 --> 15:28.632
Are you trying
to make me look handsome ?

15:30.472 --> 15:35.112
Makeup is not about looking better.
It's about starting anew.

15:36.912 --> 15:38.712
I can no longer see
the beginning,

15:41.072 --> 15:44.192
I utterly embarrassed myself
on worldwide telly.

15:47.032 --> 15:49.272
Which is why
I had to abandon everything.

16:06.272 --> 16:07.272
Look at this.

16:11.192 --> 16:13.792
THE PUNK POPE
THE MOST BELOVED

16:22.872 --> 16:27.392
My goodness !
Where did they get these photos ?

16:29.352 --> 16:33.112
A mystery !
One of the castle servants

16:33.312 --> 16:35.672
must have found it worthwhile
to sell them.

16:36.592 --> 16:40.712
- But that's not the big news.
- What's the big news ?

16:40.792 --> 16:45.552
Is the Sex Pistols have reunited
and have a plan to do me in ?

16:46.512 --> 16:49.072
No. The big news is
that people like them.

16:49.872 --> 16:52.952
These photographs have revealed
the Holy Father's tender side.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.832
And his ridiculous side ?
Simply glossed over ?

16:58.472 --> 17:03.352
Yes, because we all feel ridiculous.
We have all been embarrassed.

17:04.112 --> 17:08.152
Embarrassment leads not to
abandonment, though, but to unity.

17:09.311 --> 17:11.712
The tangible result ?
Travel agencies

17:12.071 --> 17:15.352
are experiencing a marked
increase in the number of pilgrims

17:15.472 --> 17:18.392
requesting to come to Rome
for the Angelus on Sunday.

17:19.071 --> 17:22.791
Your enthusiasm
for life is rather contagious.

17:22.872 --> 17:26.512
But I have no intention of returning
to Rome for the Angelus.

17:29.072 --> 17:32.792
- Why not ?
- Because, I am no longer the pope.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.792
I think that's something you ought
to discuss directly with Pius XIII.

17:38.872 --> 17:39.872
Sofia...

17:43.072 --> 17:44.312
Do you know how to ski ?

17:54.798 --> 17:55.798
What's all this ?

17:57.038 --> 18:00.238
All the mail that children sent you
while you were in a coma.

18:03.478 --> 18:06.438
The letters from adults,
we keep in another warehouse.

18:08.238 --> 18:11.558
- Have you read any of them ?
- I've read all of them.

18:15.958 --> 18:19.278
Would you read me one ?
That particularly struck you ?

18:28.718 --> 18:29.758
Yeah.

18:41.118 --> 18:46.918
This is from Nadja,
12 years old, from Auckland.

18:50.518 --> 18:51.558
"Hi Lenny."

18:53.398 --> 18:59.278
"Ever since you fell asleep,
my eight year old brother Mike"

19:00.798 --> 19:02.598
"can't get to sleep without you."

19:06.918 --> 19:07.958
"He is afraid."

19:10.558 --> 19:12.598
"Please wake up, Pope."

19:15.038 --> 19:18.478
"Mike needs to rest so he can
go to school in the morning".

19:26.958 --> 19:27.998
Forgive me.

19:30.518 --> 19:33.318
I can't tolerate
the thought of children suffering.

19:36.758 --> 19:37.918
I need to see Voiello.

21:04.838 --> 21:09.958
One day, when we were young, my twin
brother Adam and I were skiing.

21:10.198 --> 21:15.398
Adam had a bad fall,
and careened head long into a tree.

21:19.478 --> 21:23.558
His head was bleeding profusely,
but all I would have to have done

21:24.438 --> 21:27.278
was get him off the mountain
and he would have lived.

21:27.358 --> 21:28.478
But I could not.

21:30.678 --> 21:33.078
- Are you hurt ?
- I was scared.

21:39.598 --> 21:40.678
And I still am.

21:49.638 --> 21:51.998
- How are you ?
- Much better.

21:54.838 --> 21:57.038
And me ? How am I ?

22:02.358 --> 22:03.518
Much better.

22:09.638 --> 22:11.518
I was too strung out on heroin.

22:11.678 --> 22:15.078
So, I just sat there
and watched him bleed to death.

22:15.998 --> 22:18.998
I was destroying a family,
my one, by doing nothing.

22:20.398 --> 22:24.678
It is by doing nothing that we destroy
those precious jewel boxes

22:24.758 --> 22:26.118
that are our families.

22:27.878 --> 22:31.758
After Adam's death,
our parents abandoned me.

22:32.318 --> 22:36.718
I respected them for that
and hated them for the rest of my life.

22:38.198 --> 22:43.598
It is burdensome to feel profoundly
alone for a lifetime.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.798
It has been in fact a dead life.

22:51.318 --> 22:55.598
And God was not enough,
nor was God wisdom nor God grace,

22:56.358 --> 22:57.678
nor God presence.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.758
I have not been consoled.

23:06.638 --> 23:10.558
- Compassion, I understand yes...
- No.

23:10.958 --> 23:14.278
- You feel compassion.
- No, that's not the right word.

23:22.438 --> 23:27.678
In my first address to the cardinals,
I said that the problem is love.

23:27.758 --> 23:31.438
The world suffers
from distortions of love.

23:32.278 --> 23:37.958
But I'd never imagined, until today,
that I would be in the world.

23:39.838 --> 23:41.878
Sick loves cannot be treated.

23:42.518 --> 23:46.518
Which is why I need to feel your breath
on my face once again.

23:48.638 --> 23:51.318
Right here,
at the corner of my mouth.

23:53.158 --> 23:59.158
After which I will be compelled
to keep my distance from you, forever.

24:02.558 --> 24:04.078
In a moment, you will feel it.

24:10.718 --> 24:13.718
- What am I ?
- An emeritus pope.

24:16.358 --> 24:17.998
Like an honorary president.

24:20.078 --> 24:24.238
- In general, they don't count.
- That makes two of us, Your Holiness.

24:24.318 --> 24:29.958
You will always count, Voiello. Popes
will come and go, but you will remain.

24:31.638 --> 24:37.118
You are not gonna ask me anything ?
How I woke up ? Why I woke up ?

24:38.078 --> 24:42.318
No, because even you don't know
the answer and I am a pragmatic man.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.878
In order to come see you,
I left Girolamo home alone,

24:47.198 --> 24:49.198
a rather dangerous situation.

24:49.438 --> 24:54.918
If I am here, it's not for a chit chat,
or to reminisce about the old days.

24:55.478 --> 24:56.558
Why did you come ?

24:57.078 --> 24:59.478
For the same reason
you asked me here.

25:00.438 --> 25:03.438
For love of the Church
and to be operational again.

25:04.678 --> 25:07.718
- We have to lend the Church a hand.
- Exactly.

25:08.478 --> 25:12.758
- Good. Assente ?
- Nomen omen.

25:13.718 --> 25:17.118
Assente in English means absent.

25:18.158 --> 25:20.998
Let's leave him
where he is for the moment.

25:21.758 --> 25:24.598
We can work best behind the scenes,
you and I.

25:25.198 --> 25:30.558
You wrote that dreadful book on this
topic: "The Man Behind the Scenes."

25:30.798 --> 25:35.718
300 000 copies sold,
11 re-printings, Your Holiness.

25:36.318 --> 25:40.878
To label it "dreadful"
seems rather ungenerous of you.

25:41.918 --> 25:43.038
Let's proceed.

25:44.958 --> 25:48.438
- The real problem is...
- Terrorism ?

25:49.318 --> 25:53.078
Exactly.
First Lourdes, then Sain Peter's.

25:54.558 --> 25:58.718
They're targeting
the most vital centers of Catholicism.

25:59.398 --> 26:00.758
What do you intend to do ?

26:02.518 --> 26:06.838
- I intend to spark a revolution.
- An old obsession of yours.

26:07.318 --> 26:10.998
They dared violate
the Basilica of Saint Peter.

26:11.678 --> 26:14.118
Doesn't that seem
sufficient cause to you ?

26:15.838 --> 26:17.278
How shall I make my return ?

26:18.678 --> 26:22.678
You should begin with a discreet
appearance in the Vatican gardens.

26:23.038 --> 26:27.158
A visit to the sisters of the convent
of Santa Teresa, perhaps.

26:28.038 --> 26:33.638
Someone is bound to see you.
Rumors will start flying.

26:34.358 --> 26:38.558
I will steal a photo of you:
blurry, from a distance,

26:39.438 --> 26:42.238
which I will then leak
to the media.

26:43.078 --> 26:45.718
Everyone will get all stirred up.

26:46.958 --> 26:51.158
Sofia Dubois will call a press
conference and deny everything.

26:51.758 --> 26:56.158
But will they believe her ?
Not on your life !

26:57.198 --> 27:01.878
Next, someone will try
to interview Lindegard.

27:01.958 --> 27:06.158
Who will be elusive, enigmatic and
the world will be plagued with doubts.

27:07.038 --> 27:12.078
- Did he wake up ? Did he die ?
- Or did he rise from the dead ?

27:14.838 --> 27:18.238
You are very persuasive, Voiello.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.838
And now,
get back to your friend Girolamo.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.958
Right away, Your Holiness.

27:43.718 --> 27:45.718
One last thing, Your Holiness.

27:46.878 --> 27:51.198
When you were in coma, did you
find out anything about Napoli ?

27:52.518 --> 27:55.638
Will we win the Serie A ?
The Champions League perhaps ?

27:56.558 --> 27:57.598
The Europa League ?

27:59.758 --> 28:01.998
Yes, I did. I know everything.

28:27.118 --> 28:29.438
Do you remember
Adam's millipede ?

28:33.078 --> 28:36.998
He thought it was God.
But he was wrong, it was Satan.

28:37.918 --> 28:39.518
Even Adam made mistakes.

28:41.838 --> 28:46.278
I think it is time, Danny,
that we return to Rome.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.918
So, what is it this time ?

28:50.638 --> 28:53.798
You would like to say mass ?
You want a female pope ?

28:56.598 --> 29:01.638
Cardinal Voiello granted our institute
authorization to welcome orphans.

29:02.358 --> 29:07.678
- You revoked that authorization.
- Which is well within my jurisdiction.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.278
But why did you do it ?

29:11.878 --> 29:17.158
The Convent of Saint Teresa has long
had a much more important mission:

29:17.838 --> 29:21.678
to serve and assist the pope
and the cardinals of the Curia.

29:21.758 --> 29:25.158
An euphemism for washing and ironing
your underwear and sock for free.

29:25.918 --> 29:31.718
We are perfectly capable of taking care
of the pope, the cardinals, and orphans

29:31.918 --> 29:33.518
all at the same time.

29:33.678 --> 29:34.758
No.

29:34.918 --> 29:39.198
We will move ahead regardless.
With or without your authorization.

29:42.038 --> 29:48.318
I highly doubt it. I am unshakeable.
And, contrary to my predecessor,

29:49.038 --> 29:51.718
I am not fond
of diplomacy or negotiating.

29:53.438 --> 29:54.598
The question is closed.

29:56.598 --> 30:02.918
Any step you take to counter my
revocation will be severely punished.

30:03.398 --> 30:07.998
You really don't care about orphans,
do you ?

30:10.398 --> 30:12.318
Someone else can care about them.

30:13.078 --> 30:17.598
I have no intention of seeing
a herd of screaming children

30:17.758 --> 30:19.638
grazing in the Vatican gardens.

30:20.678 --> 30:24.758
I detest both children and orphans.

31:59.438 --> 32:01.598
First they took Faisal,

32:04.198 --> 32:07.598
and now they're going
to take my baby away too.

32:10.038 --> 32:11.078
How did it go ?

32:12.758 --> 32:13.758
Splendidly.

32:17.518 --> 32:21.558
I detest both children and orphans.

33:23.498 --> 33:27.738
My condolences, Eminence.
I heard a friend of yours passed away.

33:28.858 --> 33:31.178
My only friend. Thank you.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.618
My mentor Cardinal Newman
wrote that

33:34.778 --> 33:38.938
"the specific duty of the Christian
is to oppose the world."

33:40.658 --> 33:46.778
However I cannot do it alone
but with you at my side, I can try.

33:50.058 --> 33:55.338
On two conditions.
One: with your permission,

33:56.418 --> 34:01.538
I will eliminate Guicciardini,
Spalletta and Tomas Altbruck.

34:02.818 --> 34:06.458
And no government
will take anything from the Church.

34:07.498 --> 34:13.538
You will risk nothing.
Your private life will remain private.

34:14.777 --> 34:19.177
You are the pope.
And no ones blackmails the pope.

34:20.257 --> 34:24.377
No one touches the pope.
No one questions the pope.

34:25.377 --> 34:28.617
Not as long as I am here
to protect him.

34:30.377 --> 34:34.536
Which is why, Holy Father,
I was the longest standing

34:34.777 --> 34:37.657
Secretary of State
in the history of the Church.

34:40.056 --> 34:45.016
- And the second condition ?
- You must do me a favor.

34:46.056 --> 34:50.617
If you do, I will return
as your Secretary of State.

35:25.017 --> 35:30.857
Hello, my dear.
Might you have half a minute for me ?

38:09.808 --> 38:14.368
Love your neighbor as yourself,
Jesus says.

38:15.288 --> 38:18.688
I only have one neighbor:
you, Girolamo.

38:21.248 --> 38:24.608
I'm not very good at speaking
in front of so many people.

38:26.088 --> 38:29.528
With Girolamo,
I spent many a simple, serene hour.

38:30.608 --> 38:34.328
We didn't need to do grandiose things
in order to be happy.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.568
We didn't need
to make grand speeches,

38:37.688 --> 38:40.968
between friends,
silence is golden.

38:42.608 --> 38:46.408
Why did I ask you all here today,
in memory of Girolamo ?

38:48.128 --> 38:50.128
To repair an injustice.

38:51.208 --> 38:52.648
Because I am the only one

38:52.848 --> 38:56.888
who had the great good fortune
of spending time with him.

38:58.568 --> 39:00.248
I intend to right that wrong.

39:01.608 --> 39:05.368
Which means I need to tell you
who Girolamo is.

39:07.928 --> 39:12.568
Girolamo is the world that suffers.
Girolamo is grace.

39:14.088 --> 39:15.968
Girolamo is goodness and virtue.

39:17.208 --> 39:21.128
Girolamo, I say this for all of you who
were not fortunate enough to know him,

39:21.448 --> 39:28.048
is kind and cheerful, joyous,
and full of life.

39:29.768 --> 39:33.848
You're probably wondering:
what does Girolamo like to do ?

39:35.288 --> 39:36.688
Girolamo loves to talk,

39:37.768 --> 39:41.608
but he also likes to listen,
and to give me advice.

39:42.888 --> 39:46.848
He likes to watch TV and to listen
to the radio together with me.

39:48.848 --> 39:53.808
Girolamo loves to run and dance,
to walk and sing and pray.

39:55.888 --> 40:00.928
He loves to swim at the sunset,
and flirt with the girls

40:04.008 --> 40:09.728
because Girolamo is a good looking boy
and he loves to give them flowers,

40:11.688 --> 40:14.488
because Girolamo loves kindness.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.848
Girolamo is everything we are not.

40:22.488 --> 40:26.728
Which is why we have gathered
here today, to celebrate him.

40:28.048 --> 40:32.248
Because we are not like him.
And because we would like to be.

40:33.408 --> 40:35.968
Which is why we contemplate
and adore him.

40:37.008 --> 40:42.208
Because Girolamo knows how to love,
and how to be a true friend.

40:43.688 --> 40:48.848
Which is why his friends have come
here today and why there are so many.

40:52.568 --> 40:54.128
Girolamo is a moral guide,

40:55.488 --> 40:59.848
which is why the leaders
of his country are all here today.

41:01.848 --> 41:07.888
Girolamo, my brothers and sisters,
is a saint.

41:09.848 --> 41:14.688
Which is why the pope himself
wanted to say mass today.

41:19.328 --> 41:22.848
Girolamo is the world that suffers.

41:24.288 --> 41:26.688
Girolamo is the world that loves.

41:28.328 --> 41:29.728
And I thank God

41:30.088 --> 41:34.528
for giving me the extraordinary
opportunity to be his best friend.

41:36.888 --> 41:41.368
Thank you, Girolamo.
You, and only you, who knew intimately

41:42.368 --> 41:46.888
the anguish of suffering,
the beauty of sacrifice,

41:48.608 --> 41:49.768
and the power of love.

41:53.048 --> 41:55.648
I will never forget you, Girolamo.

41:57.528 --> 41:58.608
Never.

45:43.248 --> 45:44.648
I brought you something.

46:14.968 --> 46:16.448
Spalletta !

46:16.568 --> 46:17.888
What the fuck's going on ?

46:31.728 --> 46:35.448
Go ahead !
Scroll through them.

46:38.848 --> 46:41.888
There must be a video of the evening
somewhere as well.

46:42.208 --> 46:47.968
We filmed it all with a camera hidden
among all these expensive bottles.

46:51.128 --> 46:52.528
What do you want, Essence ?

46:52.648 --> 46:55.288
Just one thing, one thing,
one thing, one thing,

46:55.968 --> 46:57.008
times three:

46:59.768 --> 47:01.288
your resignations.

47:02.848 --> 47:06.328
You as minister of the economy,

47:07.568 --> 47:12.728
you Altbruck, as head
of the Vatican financial structure,

47:13.728 --> 47:15.568
and you, Spalletta,

47:19.328 --> 47:22.888
will be defrocked in two hours.

47:26.008 --> 47:29.168
- In exchange for what ?
- In exchange for nothing.

47:30.208 --> 47:34.408
- Who the hell are you ?
- For you, I am God.

47:37.328 --> 47:42.408
I am the one who can save your asses,
by letting these photos sit in my phone,

47:42.568 --> 47:45.848
or I can drown you in shit,
by posting them

47:46.088 --> 47:48.408
and turning them over
to the magistrate.

47:49.488 --> 47:55.928
In order to avoid any misunderstanding,
I remind you that my friend is a minor.

47:57.608 --> 47:58.608
And finally...

48:02.608 --> 48:03.608
a little warning:

48:04.288 --> 48:09.248
if any of you dare try
and blackmail the Holy Father,

48:09.408 --> 48:10.808
I will simply...

48:13.848 --> 48:17.888
Jesus Christ, Bauer,
how silly of you !

48:22.008 --> 48:25.168
I was just about to issue a threat.

48:27.848 --> 48:31.928
Ok, here is what's gonna happen:
I'm gonna count to seven,

48:33.088 --> 48:35.128
and then it will be up to you
to decide.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.088
In theory, of course, not in practice.
In practice, I will decide.

48:40.248 --> 48:41.728
Because I am God.

48:42.848 --> 48:47.288
Just don't let word get around,

48:48.888 --> 48:50.368
it's a sensitive issue.

49:27.888 --> 49:30.208
You see, Lisette,
what you have been saying

49:31.808 --> 49:33.648
is that society is progressing,

49:35.368 --> 49:38.928
and the Church must keep pace
with society.

49:41.448 --> 49:46.128
But we are not champions of progress.
We are champions of faith.

49:47.408 --> 49:49.008
We have a duty to be different,

49:49.088 --> 49:52.128
which is why we live
with privations and sacrifices,

49:53.048 --> 49:56.408
while beyond these walls,
life is comfort and pleasure.

49:58.168 --> 50:01.648
At times,
these privations and sacrifices

50:01.848 --> 50:07.088
seem incomprehensible,
wrong to us.

50:08.928 --> 50:12.168
But they are neither.
In truth, they are mysterious.

50:13.808 --> 50:16.968
We have a duty
to be mysterious as well.

50:18.768 --> 50:20.808
This is our strength.

50:22.528 --> 50:25.928
Out there, society is predictable.

50:26.488 --> 50:29.048
And whatever is predictable
is also puerile.

50:30.848 --> 50:34.488
Am I saying that everything
must remain exactly as it is ?

50:37.368 --> 50:42.848
Not at all. But you sisters
are already different and mysterious.

50:44.128 --> 50:48.848
The priests, on the other hand,
have moved too close to civil society.

50:49.768 --> 50:53.048
So, it is not a matter
of extending to you sisters

50:53.408 --> 50:58.208
the rights and privileges of the priests,
but rather of extending to the priests

50:58.528 --> 51:01.688
the duties
and the privations of you nuns.

51:03.888 --> 51:08.208
This is the only equality
that is truly feasible in the Church.

51:09.528 --> 51:13.928
The priests must do your laundry,
just as you do theirs.

51:16.488 --> 51:19.488
They must look, within themselves,
to find your grace,

51:22.488 --> 51:23.488
your generosity,

51:25.888 --> 51:27.088
your intelligence,

51:29.368 --> 51:30.368
and your love.

51:32.128 --> 51:35.208
Your righteousness
will become their righteousness.

51:35.688 --> 51:38.928
But that's not to say that their sins
will become your sins.

51:42.248 --> 51:43.888
Which of you is without sin ?

51:54.408 --> 51:55.408
Fine.

51:57.288 --> 52:02.168
Whoever is without sin
shall cast the first stone.

52:11.648 --> 52:14.928
This would be a psychologically
mature relationship,

52:15.808 --> 52:21.008
as you would call it,
between men and women, Lisette.

52:25.008 --> 52:28.048
Tomorrow, at noon,
I want this photo everywhere.

52:29.288 --> 52:30.288
Fine.

52:31.008 --> 52:34.808
Are you happy we did
in that idiot ex-husband of yours ?

52:36.048 --> 52:40.568
Up to a point. But he will go
unpunished for what he did.

52:42.328 --> 52:45.968
True punishment
is served not in prison, Sofia,

52:46.808 --> 52:48.168
but in one's soul.

52:50.168 --> 52:55.008
Sir John must make up his mind
to meet Pius XIII.

52:55.768 --> 52:59.048
- I agree.
- You will have to convince him.

53:00.728 --> 53:02.888
No, not me.

53:05.648 --> 53:08.448
Fine. I'll convince him, then.

53:23.208 --> 53:26.248
The Catholic world is in total turmoil.
A photograph...

54:23.168 --> 54:26.488
"What is to be done ?"
as Lenin used to ask.

54:27.488 --> 54:28.888
I have two ideas.

54:30.088 --> 54:35.208
The first: an official denial
so as to calm agitated souls.

54:36.328 --> 54:37.848
We can release a statement:

54:38.168 --> 54:42.928
"That picture of Lenny Belardo
is nothing but an old photograph."

54:43.488 --> 54:45.248
That will convince no one.

54:45.648 --> 54:50.328
True, but it will insinuate doubt.
And doubt is a weapon.

54:50.848 --> 54:52.488
And your second idea ?

54:53.968 --> 54:56.088
- To reinforce you, Holy Father.
- How ?

54:56.568 --> 55:01.848
With the golden opportunity that you
are being offered: your Angelus.

55:02.768 --> 55:06.088
The popularity
of those photos of you as a punk

55:06.648 --> 55:10.568
leads us to believe that hordes
of people will come in Sunday.

55:11.488 --> 55:17.608
Regardless, Holy Father,
even though it is not our habit,

55:18.648 --> 55:21.168
we have to make a decision
about the future.

55:22.328 --> 55:23.328
What do you mean ?

55:23.408 --> 55:27.648
We cannot confine Pius XIII
to an apartment his whole life.

55:27.888 --> 55:29.528
What do you recommend we do ?

55:30.328 --> 55:35.248
That is a decision
only you and Pius XIII can decide.

55:35.568 --> 55:36.568
But how ?

55:38.448 --> 55:39.568
By meeting.

55:40.305 --> 55:46.150
