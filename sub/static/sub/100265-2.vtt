WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:13.722
Okay, so what now?

00:13.805 --> 00:15.807
Nothing's changed. We stick to the plan.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.727
Oh, so getting stuck at the edge
of a massive alien waterfall was...

00:18.810 --> 00:19.728
part of the plan?

00:19.811 --> 00:22.439
The lightning storm should be starting
in 97 minutes, give or take.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.483
We need to be ready
to spark the engines when that happens.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.027
Everybody remember their assignments?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.029
Siphon methane from the air
and fill up our tanks.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.280
Yeah, I got the sails.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.365
We'll break down the mast
and stow the rigging below.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.326
Leave the lines for me. If we're gonna
catch the power from the storm,

00:35.410 --> 00:37.245
I need every inch I can get
for the kite.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.706
-Don!
-Present.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.751
-You know what you're doing?
-Yes. Just sounds cooler when you say it.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.712
Penny, just make sure Don has everything
he needs to clear us for launch.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.839
-Are we not gonna talk about it?
-What?

00:47.922 --> 00:50.175
The giant metal trench
in the middle of the planet.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.552
Something like that doesn't just happen.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.678
Someone built it.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.305
Don't you wanna know who?

00:55.388 --> 00:56.389
Of course I do,

00:56.473 --> 00:58.391
but right now, we need to focus
on the fact that

00:58.475 --> 01:01.436
16 billion joules of energy are about
to strike right where we're standing.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.772
All in favor of finding
a new place to stand!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.441
As long we stay
inside the Jupiter, we'll be fine.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.486
The ship will act as a Faraday cage,
sending the energy around us...

01:10.028 --> 01:11.279
instead of through us.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.782
Hey.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.535
We'll look into what's down there.
Soon as we're airborne.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.453
Excuse me.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.580
I didn't get a job.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.583
Your job is to do nothing...
and touch nothing.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.835
If we ever need to sail again,
we'll call you.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.961
All right, let's get to it.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.381
She never likes it
when someone else saves the day.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.485
You know,

01:50.568 --> 01:53.029
I was talking to Will yesterday
and he told me that

01:53.113 --> 01:55.824
Ben Franklin wasn't the only one
to try the kite experiment,

01:56.449 --> 01:59.786
that a man named Georg Reichmann
tried it a couple weeks later.

01:59.869 --> 02:03.748
Yeah? History books
never talk about the second guy.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.418
That's because lightning jumped
to his forehead, killing him instantly.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.131
Will needs to learn
to keep some things to himself.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.824
- Hey!

02:37.907 --> 02:39.367
Why are you hugging the wall?

02:39.909 --> 02:41.911
-Do you hear that?

02:42.036 --> 02:42.954
What, the ticking?

02:43.037 --> 02:43.872
-Yeah.
-Yeah,

02:43.955 --> 02:46.374
it's probably one of the rotators
in the cooling slats.

02:46.457 --> 02:50.545
As it happens, when you turn a spaceship
into a submarine, it ticks!

02:54.340 --> 02:57.177
<i>Hey, Will!</i>
<i>How's it coming with that methane filter?</i>

02:57.594 --> 03:00.013
<i>Give me a sec,</i>
<i>I'm heading to the cockpit now.</i>

03:07.729 --> 03:09.105
What are you doing in here?

03:09.647 --> 03:12.066
Just keeping out of the way.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.197
I've always been fascinated by seaweed.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.617
People treat it like floating garbage,

03:20.700 --> 03:23.411
but what they don't realize
is they use it everyday.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.123
In their toothpastes, lotions, shampoos.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
All the stuff that makes 'em pretty.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.294
It's like a lot of things, I guess.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.758
Only appreciated when you learn
how helpful they can be.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.304
Are you honestly looking to be appreciated
for navigating us through that storm?

03:41.387 --> 03:43.473
-It was kind of a big deal.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.600
You were doing it to save yourself.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.810
Not my family, not me...

03:50.313 --> 03:51.314
...just you.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.649
Look at him!

03:52.732 --> 03:54.817
Such a big boy now.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.116
I notice you never once visited me
while I was locked up.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.495
We have nothing to talk about.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.455
Ah, of course we do.
You and I...

04:08.539 --> 04:10.708
we're the only ones who know
what it's like

04:10.792 --> 04:12.502
to be connected to the robot.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.087
You were not connected to him.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.881
You were using him.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.049
Is there a difference?

04:18.633 --> 04:22.262
The robot's job is to give the master
what he wants.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.347
I wanted a bodyguard,

04:24.847 --> 04:26.432
you wanted a friend.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.684
Excuse me.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.978
I have work to do.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.441
Oh, you poor girl!

04:35.525 --> 04:37.568
Look what they've done to you,
these Robinsons!

04:37.652 --> 04:39.487
This is an abusive relationship.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.905
Gotta get you a safe word.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.993
Hand it over.  Got it.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.786
Do you need any help?

04:46.869 --> 04:49.622
Actually, yes. You got a crowbar in there
or something?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.375
I need to get this kelp-looking stuff
off the ship.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.085
Well, it's a good thing
I was here.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.920
I don't know what you would've done

04:56.004 --> 04:58.756
if I wasn't around to hand you
this piece of metal.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.092
Thank you.

05:02.927 --> 05:06.389
Is it just me or does it feel like
Mom always gives me the dummy jobs?

05:06.472 --> 05:09.183
Just so I understand the question,
helping me is the dummy job?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.935
I didn't mean it that way.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.482
It's just Will always gets the smart jobs,
and Judy always gets the tough jobs,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.735
then I get the jobs
that literally anybody else could do.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.696
Ugh, you're looking
at this all wrong, Penny.

05:21.779 --> 05:25.366
Flying under the radar is a good thing.
It's actually one of my core principles.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.327
It's right up there with
"Never raise your hand,"

05:27.410 --> 05:31.289
"Always sit in the back" and
"Never, ever, be too good at anything."

05:31.372 --> 05:33.249
-And that works for you?
- Perfectly.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.086
Until I met you people.
Bunch of over-achievers.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.297
Should've known you'd get me into trouble.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.466
<i>Don, how's it going?</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:43.217
Speaking of which...

05:43.301 --> 05:44.260
Everything checking out?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.179
<i>Yeah. Few bumps</i>
<i>and scrapes here and there.</i>

05:46.262 --> 05:48.639
She could use a paint job, but she'll fly.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.643
<i>I just gotta get this stuff off</i>
<i>that's clinging to the side of the ship.</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:55.396
Oh yeah, the kelp. We saw some of that
building up on the bow.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.982
It's in there pretty strong.
I think it'll burn in the atmosphere,

05:58.066 --> 06:00.443
but I wanna make sure it doesn't mess
with the thrusters.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.363
Okay, let me know if you want me
to come down and take a look at anything.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.614
Okay!

06:05.073 --> 06:07.450
Know what, Penny,
I need something stronger than this. Here.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.327
Go inside, check in to see--

06:09.410 --> 06:10.953
-Ow!
- What? What's wrong?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.289
The kelp, it bit me!
What the hell is this stuff?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.708
-Should I get Judy?
-No, no, no, no-- No, It's fine.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.919
My leg though-- It, like, feels numb.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.962
-Is it cutting off your circulation?
-I don't know--

06:23.007 --> 06:25.802
Oh, God! I can't move my leg!

06:25.885 --> 06:27.095
-Mom!
-Penny?

06:27.678 --> 06:30.056
- Penny? Are you okay?
- <i>Mom!</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:31.933
<i>Mom!</i>

06:32.016 --> 06:33.726
John, the kite!

06:36.687 --> 06:38.356
No, no, no, no!

06:39.690 --> 06:40.525
Oh!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.743
Go, go-go, go-go!
Hold on!

06:51.202 --> 06:53.121
Don! Give me your arm.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.497
-Mom? I'm slipping!
-I got you.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.083
Careful! The kelp--
Don't let it touch you! Don't touch it!

06:57.166 --> 06:58.709
Mom! Mom, I'm losing it!

06:58.793 --> 07:00.169
Use your legs! Fight the current!

07:00.253 --> 07:03.464
-Mom, Mom, it's too strong! Mom!
-I'm coming!

07:04.966 --> 07:07.635
- Hold on, Penny!
-Will, Judy, get down to the airlock!

07:12.223 --> 07:13.641
Mom!

07:15.017 --> 07:18.271
Penny! Maureen! No!

07:23.985 --> 07:27.238
Maureen, Penny, come in.
Do you copy?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.510
Wow.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.055
- We're okay.
- What do we do now?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.891
- <i>We're okay!</i>

07:56.100 --> 07:56.934
Thank you.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.353
I don't think this is what "okay"
is supposed to feel like.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.147
We're breathing, we're in one piece--

08:01.230 --> 08:03.399
This is exactly what "okay"
is supposed to feel like.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.151
Check your suits for compromise.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.988
Punctures, cracked glass,
damaged filtration.

08:09.071 --> 08:09.906
Um...

08:11.324 --> 08:12.575
Good! We're good.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.912
We're good, we're good.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.672
Incredible.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.594
Are we still not talking about this place?
I'm actually kind of okay with that.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.515
That must be why
the lightning was drawn here.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.018
The metal--
It must act like some kind of conductor.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.869
Hey, guys? I don't like you
being down there on your own.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.996
I'm gonna try and find a way
to get down to you.

08:59.080 --> 08:59.914
John, no.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.500
Stay up there, we're fine!

09:03.334 --> 09:04.377
We just gotta...

09:06.420 --> 09:09.715
We just need to find a way back up,
somehow.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.678
Wow, this is embarrassing.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.721
Hey, don't touch the kelp.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.639
I see it.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.225
Just don't take a picture of me!
Or tell anyone about this--

09:19.308 --> 09:21.561
-I have a reputation to uphold!
- Okay, stop talking.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.188
Okay. There we go.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.232
Mom and Penny, they went over the edge.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.734
- I know, Dad said they're okay.
- Ow!

09:28.818 --> 09:31.320
Hey, why don't you go help them?
I can handle this.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.947
-You sure?
- Yeah, you sure?

09:33.030 --> 09:35.491
'Cause I'm having a hard time
feeling my everything.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.577
Just go. Okay? Hey, radio if you need me.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.537
-Okay?
-Ow!

09:39.620 --> 09:40.913
Yeah, steady.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.001
I have an idea.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.210
The kite.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.548
Take it down, attach it, tie it off,
and then lower the other end down to us.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.091
It should be long enough to reach.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.510
- Already on it!
-Great minds.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.721
We've got, uh...

09:56.804 --> 09:58.347
Sixty-eight? No, 67!

09:58.431 --> 09:59.515
Sixty-seven minutes.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.977
So once we get back up,
we'll just relaunch the kite,

10:03.060 --> 10:04.312
ready before the lightning hits.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.108
Okay, going as fast as I can.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.029
Please be careful.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.113
Stop moving!

10:14.196 --> 10:17.325
-I'm just saying, that's my favorite leg!
-That's why I have to cut the stuff off,

10:17.408 --> 10:19.994
because whatever toxin is affecting
your body is coming from there.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.830
Something's happening. Something's
happening, I can't feel my head.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.707
Good-- If I make a mistake,
then it won't hurt.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.042
That's not funny.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.755
Dad-- Dad, careful.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.091
Almost there.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.108
Dad! Dad!

10:51.942 --> 10:54.111
John, are you okay?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.113
I'm okay. Come on.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.116
Mom-- Mom, look, the kite.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.535
Are we stuck down here?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.289
No. We're-- We're okay.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.875
We've got time. John?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.293
Yeah, I'm here.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.713
It's okay, we'll just--
We'll just have to find another way.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.799
I know... I know.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.135
Use Will and Judy,
put your heads together.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.845
And we'll do the same down here.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.263
<i>Okay.</i>

11:23.766 --> 11:27.019
Hey, I'll see you soon, okay?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.397
See you soon.

11:30.022 --> 11:30.856
Hey.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.982
We'll figure it out.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.776
Okay?

11:35.111 --> 11:35.986
Okay.

11:36.987 --> 11:37.822
Hey.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.617
We'll figure something out.
What does your mom always say?

11:43.619 --> 11:45.079
Every problem has a solution.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.960
Can you make yourself useful
and help clean this stuff up?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.380
I'd love to, but your mother specifically
ordered me not to tou--

11:54.463 --> 11:56.006
Well, my mother is not here right now!

11:57.299 --> 12:00.469
-Must be nice being in charge for once.
-Yeah, stick to your chores.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.724
Don, I think you're going
into anaphylactic shock.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.811
I need to mitigate the spread of the toxin
before it reaches your brain,

12:08.894 --> 12:11.313
so I'm gonna give you
a blood transfusion, okay?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.649
My hero.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.319
No, not exactly.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.783
There's only one person here
that has the same blood type and...

12:23.784 --> 12:24.618
it's not me.

12:28.622 --> 12:33.002
I'd be honored to donate
to such a worthy cause.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.172
Absolutely not.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.423
This is serious, Don.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.842
It's either her or I send you
into a medically induced coma.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.094
-You won't survive any other way.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.475
The surface is too slick
to climb.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.310
There's nowhere to grip.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.020
What about all the rigging
from the sails?

12:51.103 --> 12:55.191
-Can we build some kind of scaffolding?
-That'll give us 30 feet at the most.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.734
Still have 120 feet to go.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.278
I was thinking--
Even if we make it up in time,

12:59.361 --> 13:01.822
without that kite, we will not be able
to jump-start our engine.

13:02.156 --> 13:02.990
I know.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.910
If we can't get up before the lightning
hits, we won't be able to survive.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.205
I don't need more problems
right now, Penny, I need solutions.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.501
I'm sorry, it's just...

13:15.044 --> 13:16.253
No, it's fine. I get it.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.548
-No, I shouldn't have said it like that.
-It's fine. I'd be frustrated too.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.052
I mean, of all your kids
to get stuck with,

13:23.135 --> 13:24.553
you got stuck with me, so...

13:25.554 --> 13:28.182
-Penny, that has nothing to do with--
-Come on.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.644
You wouldn't rather have Will here
to bounce around geometrical formulas?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.395
Geometry isn't gonna get us out of this.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.397
And if Will was here,
he would know that.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.650
Judy? She would've run 30 miles by now

13:37.733 --> 13:39.443
and found some kind of tree
with space leaves

13:39.527 --> 13:41.570
-strong enough to build a space ladder.
-Stop it.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.449
Each of you have talents
that make you unique.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.827
It's just that some talents
are more useful than others.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.744
Enough!

13:57.545 --> 14:00.005
Hope your father's having more luck
than we are.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.842
-It's nowhere near enough to reach them!
-Did you get the cargo netting?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.426
I got everything.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.303
There must be another way.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.514
Well, if there is,
I haven't found it yet.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.104
You thinking about the robot?

14:17.648 --> 14:19.900
I wish he was here too.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.571
You know, when I was deployed,
there were some hard days.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.032
But what kept me going
was the thought of seeing you.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.786
I knew I would do whatever it took
to get back to you.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.706
I think the robot feels the same way.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.875
And I also know,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.795
no matter how crazy the world got,
you'd be okay.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.214
Because you, your mom, your sisters,

14:42.298 --> 14:43.799
you keep each other safe.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.843
And that's what we got to do right now.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.344
-We have to.
-Wait!

14:48.470 --> 14:49.847
-That's it.
-What is?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.181
Keep each other safe!

14:56.103 --> 14:58.814
Mom said that we'd be safe in here
when the lightning strikes,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.691
because the Jupiter will act
as a Faraday cage.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.776
I know, but your mom
and your sister aren't in it.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.862
So let's get them one of their own.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.740
We can't build a Faraday cage down here.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.034
It's a good idea, but we don't have
enough time

15:10.117 --> 15:12.661
-to construct anything sound enough--
<i>-</i> <i>We don't have  to build it.</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:13.746
We already have one.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.748
<i>In the garage.</i>

15:16.123 --> 15:18.542
-The Chariot!
-<i>We just have to get it down.</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:19.668
Could that work?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.463
We never officially tested it
for the temperature, but yeah, it should!

15:22.546 --> 15:24.840
I know it doesn't exactly solve
our kite problem.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.383
<i>But at least you guys will be safe.</i>

15:27.217 --> 15:28.052
Wait! Wait!

15:28.135 --> 15:30.012
Maybe-- Maybe we don't need the kite.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.932
The Chariot's winch cable
is conductive metal.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.017
If we use it to lower the Chariot down,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.061
then maybe we could kill two birds
with one stone.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.772
Just to clarify, we are not the two birds
being killed, right?

15:39.855 --> 15:42.691
Hot wire the other end of the winch cable
to our engine,

15:42.775 --> 15:45.361
and then when the lightning hits,
it'll act like--

15:45.444 --> 15:46.570
Jumper cables, I get it.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.197
But there's one problem with your plan--

15:48.322 --> 15:50.282
Well, there's more than one,
but the first one--

15:50.366 --> 15:51.200
What's that?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.702
Chariot's on the Jupiter, in the garage.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.579
<i>I know!</i>

15:56.246 --> 15:57.331
Which is underwater.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.380
I guess it's a good thing
I married a Navy Seal.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.553
So what happens when we open up
the ramp?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.431
Besides turning the garage
into a toxic aquarium?

16:15.140 --> 16:18.477
I mean,
are we sure the Chariot won't just sink?

16:18.560 --> 16:22.856
Chariot's no different than the ACVs
Marines would drop off of carriers.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.400
It's all about buoyancy.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.987
Something weighs less than the liquid
it's displacing, it'll float.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.949
Okay, we good? We need to seal the garage
so we don't flood the rest of the ship.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.409
All right, be right there!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.053
Will, come on!

16:58.600 --> 16:59.476
All clear?

16:59.560 --> 17:00.644
Yeah! I think so!

17:00.728 --> 17:03.397
Floodgates open in three, two, one.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.359
That doesn't sound right.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.777
-No, it does not.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.283
-Must be stuck.
-On what?

17:21.498 --> 17:22.791
Oh, great.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.005
Okay, I just need the both of you to relax

17:28.088 --> 17:30.090
-and let the transfusion run its course.
-Hey, Jude.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.009
What do you use
to cut that stuff off Don's leg?

17:32.092 --> 17:33.844
Um, a-- A plasma torch, why?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.095
-How many do we have?
-Dad!

17:35.179 --> 17:36.805
Kelp's blocking the garage. Can't open it.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.058
Why would you need to open the garage,
it's underwater?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.768
Look, I don't have time to explain.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.811
I just gotta get this done
and I need your help.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.730
Are they gonna be okay for a few minutes?

17:44.813 --> 17:45.856
Yeah, yeah.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.192
Let's go.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.947
Alone at last.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.659
What's taking them so long?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.495
The Chariot should be down by now.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.790
Thirty-six minutes.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.794
I'm sure they're fine. Will and Judy
are up there to help him figure it out.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.964
-You know, you saved us too.
-When?

18:11.048 --> 18:14.927
In the diamond storm.
We were stuck and you rescued us.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.554
I disobeyed you
and basically stole the Chariot.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.473
My point is you saved us.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.559
So,  my special skill
is misbehaving?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.019
You must be so proud.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.730
Is there something going on with you
that I'm supposed to know about?

18:28.774 --> 18:29.817
Hey!

18:30.359 --> 18:32.152
Since when don't we talk to each other?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.239
What'd you think about my book?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.324
-What?
-My book.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.202
Will gave us all copies
and I've heard from everyone else.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.120
Did you read it?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.122
Of course I did.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.791
Did you have a favorite part?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.503
I-- I think it-- It was, um...

18:51.338 --> 18:54.007
It was just seeing how much you've grown
as a writer.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.053
Well, thank you.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.936
I can't wait to see
what you write about this place!

19:12.151 --> 19:14.153
A few facts wrong here and there, but...

19:15.821 --> 19:17.072
her voice is strong.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.076
And she likes my hair...

19:22.619 --> 19:23.495
which is nice.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.082
It's full of revelations.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.044
For example, Judy dreams
of moving away from home.

19:32.129 --> 19:36.091
Someone named Vijay Dhar
is apparently a bad kisser.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.136
And Don West, why...

19:39.720 --> 19:41.096
turns out he's a smuggler.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.104
Whatever happens,
don't touch the kelp-- It's toxic.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.777
Twenty-nine minutes!

19:55.861 --> 19:57.696
Don't worry
about checking the time.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.324
I set an alert
so we're all on the same count.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.617
Keep going!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.535
Damn, this stuff is strong.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.460
All this time,
pretending that you're better than me,

20:11.543 --> 20:12.711
when in reality,

20:13.837 --> 20:16.465
we're two peas in a pod.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.383
Both of us outsiders,

20:18.800 --> 20:20.427
rejected from the colony,

20:20.510 --> 20:21.887
no family of our own.

20:21.970 --> 20:26.558
So we-- We orbit the Robinsons like two--

20:26.642 --> 20:28.393
Please stop talking.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.812
Your getting your speech back,
that's progress.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.940
You and I are nothing alike.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.567
And there's one big difference.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.155
If we make it to civilization,

20:40.739 --> 20:41.949
I'm going back to work

20:43.617 --> 20:45.494
and you'll go straight to jail.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.796
Is that so?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.047
Hmm.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.470
I wonder how your superiors would feel

21:04.137 --> 21:05.264
if they knew...

21:06.306 --> 21:09.810
that when we first met,
you were trying to steal a Jupiter.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.688
The <i>Resolute </i>was in need of repair,

21:12.771 --> 21:14.773
instead of doing your job,

21:16.525 --> 21:17.651
you were running away.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.822
And they may be able to overlook that...

21:24.116 --> 21:25.826
but the thing is I'm a criminal,

21:25.951 --> 21:28.161
and you aided and abetted my escape.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.915
-That was different. I didn't know--
- Oh, come on, Don.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.419
You saw me squeeze into that space suit
that clearly wasn't my size.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.130
And you can tell yourself
whatever you want,

21:38.213 --> 21:41.258
but deep down, you knew.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.928
And I'm pretty sure they don't let
accomplices have their jobs back.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.389
You're so lucky I can't move right now.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.974
Here's how this is gonna work.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.851
If we make it back to civilization,

21:50.934 --> 21:53.603
I expect there's going to be trouble
headed my way,

21:54.104 --> 21:56.940
so I expect your cooperation, Don.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.944
I expect you to say

22:01.028 --> 22:04.197
that I am whoever they say I am.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.160
I expect loyalty, Don.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.999
After all, we're blood brothers now.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.800
How come you didn't tell me
Mom and Penny were in this much trouble?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.844
You were helping Don.
I didn't wanna pull you away.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.263
If I would've known,
I could've helped you.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.307
-Hey, Jude!

22:30.390 --> 22:31.808
Judy!

22:31.892 --> 22:33.226
You okay?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.895
- You okay?
-Yeah.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.522
-You sure?
-Yeah, it didn't puncture my suit.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.192
Okay, you two, head up top.
I'll finish off.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.027
No, Dad. It'll go much faster
with all of us.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.195
This is too dangerous.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.615
-Dad, don't treat me like a kid!
- I'm not treating you like a kid,

22:46.698 --> 22:49.076
I'm treating you like a doctor--
The only one we have.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.994
If anything happens,
we're going to need you.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.455
You trust me to save people's lives,
but not to help you?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.999
Jude, this is not about trust!
It's about being smart.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.542
Now, go!

22:58.251 --> 22:59.127
Go!

23:01.755 --> 23:02.631
Judy, come on.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.926
-Hurry, this way! We gotta go!
- Okay.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.484
Hey, he's gonna be okay.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.737
Judy, no!

23:25.821 --> 23:26.738
Dad!

23:29.574 --> 23:32.119
No, baby, get up! Go! Move!

23:33.161 --> 23:34.121
Move!

23:44.005 --> 23:46.675
-We're not done, come on!
- Will, go!

23:46.758 --> 23:48.427
- <i>Mom, Penny.</i>
-Will?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.303
<i>The Chariot, we got it out.</i>

23:51.638 --> 23:53.014
<i>Okay, we'll be ready!</i>

23:54.641 --> 23:55.767
There it is. There it is!

24:04.151 --> 24:05.861
Great job, you guys. Great job!

24:06.445 --> 24:09.573
<i>-Did you have trouble getting it out?</i>
<i>-</i> Nothing we couldn't handle.

24:11.324 --> 24:15.245
Okay, John,<i> </i>once the lightning hits,
you lift off. Okay?

24:15.328 --> 24:18.331
There's no telling how long the Jupiter
can withstand that kind of strike.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.917
<i>Come on, come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on.</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:22.878
Come on, come on, come on.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.337
Okay, come on.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.797
- What?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.632
What happened? Why did it stop?

24:28.633 --> 24:29.593
John?

24:30.677 --> 24:32.095
That's the end of the cable.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.513
What? Are you sure?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.640
Yeah! You said there was enough.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.309
There should've been!

24:38.602 --> 24:40.729
Maybe the Jupiter shifted, or--

24:40.854 --> 24:42.397
Or maybe the cable got caught around--

24:51.907 --> 24:54.784
We don't have time to figure it out.
We just need to get up there.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.162
How? It's gotta be
at least 30 feet.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.371
Right, 30 feet.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.124
Thirty feet, 30 feet-- Wait!

25:01.875 --> 25:03.168
Penny figured it out.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.252
You figured it out.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.171
-I did?
-The rigging from the sails!

25:08.006 --> 25:09.716
Look, you may have me over a barrel,

25:09.799 --> 25:12.552
but the Robinson's are gonna turn you in
the first chance they get.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.847
It doesn't matter what I say
or who I say it to.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.849
Let me worry about the Robinsons.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.143
I've been living with them
for seven months.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.771
I know exactly what they think about you.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.690
So do I, but I don't need all of them,

25:25.774 --> 25:26.983
just one.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.987
Divide and conquer, that's your plan?

25:31.613 --> 25:32.447
Hah.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.327
Guess what?

25:38.453 --> 25:39.871
It's not gonna happen, lady.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.582
And you don't need a book
to tell you that.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.377
<i>Because despite their differences...</i>

25:45.460 --> 25:46.336
Come on, Mom.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.799
<i>...or their disagreements...</i>

25:51.633 --> 25:53.510
<i>when the rubber meets the road...</i>

25:54.886 --> 25:56.471
<i>this family sticks together.</i>

26:00.934 --> 26:02.936
<i>So go ahead,</i> <i>blackmail me.</i>

26:03.019 --> 26:06.398
But at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter if I have your back,

26:06.856 --> 26:08.525
because the Robinsons never will.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.155
-We'll see about that.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.245
- You got it.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.915
<i>Atmospheric event in 90 seconds.</i>

26:28.420 --> 26:30.338
Maureen, talk to me!

26:31.006 --> 26:32.299
We're getting there!

26:35.093 --> 26:35.969
How close?

26:36.052 --> 26:37.012
We'll make it!

26:38.263 --> 26:40.473
- Hold on!

26:42.225 --> 26:43.852
Penny, you've got to keep going!

26:44.102 --> 26:45.562
I'm trying.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.397
You can make it, I know you can.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.650
Will, Judy, strap in.

26:51.234 --> 26:54.404
Maureen, I'm gonna be with you
all the way. You hear me?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.239
<i>We're almost there!</i>

26:56.323 --> 26:57.532
<i>Stay with me.</i>

26:57.616 --> 26:59.367
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>when you're in the Chariot.</i>

26:59.451 --> 27:01.328
I'm in! Mom's right behind me.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.375
Oh, my God. Lightning hit--

27:08.418 --> 27:09.461
What happened?

27:09.544 --> 27:11.755
Electricity interfering
with the radio waves.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.382
-I'll go check on them.
- No! Will, strap in.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.052
We're gonna launch
as soon as the lightning hits.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.054
-But what about Mom and Pen--
-They'll be there!

27:25.977 --> 27:29.105
The doors-- The doors, like,
why are they taking so long?

27:29.648 --> 27:32.567
Penny, I--
I didn't read your book.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.653
-I know.
-But I will.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.696
I will-- First thing, I promise.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.325
Come here.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.161
I love you.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.874
-We got juice!
- Hold on!

28:09.646 --> 28:11.022
-Bring them in.
-All right.

28:11.731 --> 28:12.857
Almost there.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.526
Fifteen...

28:15.068 --> 28:15.902
Mom?

28:15.985 --> 28:17.987
- Ten...
- Penny? Do you hear me?

28:18.571 --> 28:19.406
Five...

28:19.489 --> 28:20.323
Mom!

28:20.740 --> 28:23.201
Penny! Can you hear me?

28:23.284 --> 28:24.744
We have to go check on them.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.789
-No, wait until the ramp's up! Judy?
-All right, oxygen level restored.

28:27.872 --> 28:31.334
Setting auto-pilot. Let's go! Let's go!

28:35.547 --> 28:37.257
Mom! Penny!

28:37.340 --> 28:38.174
Wait!

28:46.349 --> 28:47.517
Come on!

28:50.186 --> 28:51.271
Penny!

28:51.354 --> 28:52.897
Mom, Penny, please.

28:54.065 --> 28:54.899
Maureen?

29:02.824 --> 29:03.950
Penny?

29:05.702 --> 29:07.746
- Hey!

29:08.037 --> 29:09.330
Penny!

29:09.414 --> 29:11.082
- Hey!
-Penny!

29:16.421 --> 29:18.715
-Are you okay? You okay?
-Oh, oh!

29:19.340 --> 29:23.052
You know, right now that island we left
back there isn't looking so bad.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.680
Really? You got jokes now?

29:29.309 --> 29:30.351
Mwah!

29:30.852 --> 29:32.020
Where's Will?

29:33.229 --> 29:35.690
-Mom!

29:35.815 --> 29:36.941
Hi-- Oh!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.359
Hey, Dad, um...

29:39.068 --> 29:41.070
Look, I just wanted to say that, uh...

29:41.154 --> 29:43.114
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm 19

29:43.198 --> 29:45.325
and I can handle a lot more
than you're letting me.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.494
I know.
I know, but here's the thing, Jude.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.329
A part of being an adult

29:49.412 --> 29:51.915
is realizing just because
you can do something

29:51.998 --> 29:53.583
doesn't always mean you should.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.126
-Huh?

29:55.210 --> 29:58.171
Yeah, like, uh, putting a mast
on top of the Jupiter?

30:04.093 --> 30:05.887
Come on, let's get upstairs.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.315
-Does anyone else hear that?
- Hear what?

30:18.149 --> 30:20.902
That sound. I've been hearing it all day.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.906
-Will! Will, look out!
- Will, get down! Will!

30:27.242 --> 30:28.910
What the hell is that thing doing here?

30:28.993 --> 30:31.955
It's from when we were attacked...
by the SAR.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's a SAR?

30:34.415 --> 30:35.917
Second Alien Robot.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.878
Okay, in my defense, we have been attacked
by a lot of things.

30:40.046 --> 30:40.922
All this time...

30:42.048 --> 30:42.966
it's been in here.

30:43.508 --> 30:47.095
It must've been stuck and jarred loose
from when we flooded the garage.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.015
So has it been alive this whole time?

30:51.599 --> 30:53.184
Or did something turn it on?

30:54.060 --> 30:54.894
Possibly...

30:55.520 --> 30:58.064
The metal in the trench--
There were these glyphs

30:58.356 --> 31:01.985
carved into it, and I-I can't be sure,
but they looked like the markings--

31:02.068 --> 31:02.986
On the robot?

31:03.903 --> 31:04.779
And his ship.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.948
What does that mean?

31:07.031 --> 31:10.118
It means whoever made him,
made this place too.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.039
Is that good or bad?

31:15.123 --> 31:17.000
I really cannot
tell the difference anymore.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.668
Maybe if we go back down there

31:18.751 --> 31:20.920
and studied the glyphs,
we can find a clue about--

31:21.004 --> 31:23.590
Only place we are going is as far away
from here as possible.

31:23.673 --> 31:24.883
But you said once we got in--

31:24.966 --> 31:27.969
I know what I said! But right now,
we have bigger problems than the robot.

31:28.052 --> 31:28.887
Like what?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.514
Like how many more of them are out there.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.395
Okay, let's get upstairs.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.855
We need to prep for orbit.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.232
-But, what about--
-Upstairs now.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.693
I'll be right up, I just--

31:45.069 --> 31:46.654
-I know.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.604
This is how it normally works--

32:19.687 --> 32:21.230
When you launch, someone announces,

32:21.314 --> 32:22.982
"Hey, we're about to take-off,

32:23.066 --> 32:24.817
so you might wanna strap in."

32:24.901 --> 32:27.445
Or, for example,
"Hey, if you gotta go pee-pee,

32:27.528 --> 32:30.156
you might wanna do it now,
because it's gonna be a while--"

32:30.239 --> 32:31.741
We were fine, don't listen to him.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.494
No, no, no. You were fine!
I couldn't hold on.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.579
Look, it's like I've got flippers.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.706
Ow!

32:38.790 --> 32:40.625
Welcome back. You're in recovery.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.546
Hey, Penny.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.465
Nice work, by the way.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.258
-You read it?

32:49.342 --> 32:52.011
Of course. I mean, didn't everybody?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.890
Did you have a favorite part?

32:57.225 --> 32:58.601
There was a line--

32:58.685 --> 33:01.688
Um, I'm forgetting what it was exactly,
but...

33:03.231 --> 33:04.691
Oh, wait! Now, I remember.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.819
"The irony of all this is

33:07.902 --> 33:10.196
I almost died trying to get somewhere

33:10.279 --> 33:11.698
I never even wanted to go."

33:12.740 --> 33:14.033
Those words...

33:14.826 --> 33:16.119
really stuck with me.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.456
Is it true though,
that you never wanted to leave Earth?

33:20.540 --> 33:21.874
It doesn't really matter anymore.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.167
Of course, it does.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.170
Did you ever consider just staying behind?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.380
On my own?

33:27.463 --> 33:30.258
You always struck me as a girl
who could take care of herself.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.926
My family would never let me--

33:32.010 --> 33:35.263
You also strike me as a girl
who doesn't always need permission.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.058
Anyway, go on, get your rest.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.477
Do you mind if I hold onto this?

33:42.520 --> 33:45.023
It's the only thing onboard
I haven't read three times.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.277
Sure. Yeah, thanks for reading it.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.279
My pleasure.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.420
Hey!

34:07.920 --> 34:09.297
I brought you something.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.052
I have mine.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.553
It's Mom's.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.305
So why you giving it to me?

34:17.388 --> 34:20.683
She took a couple of pictures
of the symbols we saw in the trench.

34:20.767 --> 34:21.976
Figured you would wanna see it.

34:22.852 --> 34:23.686
Thanks!

34:23.895 --> 34:25.271
Hey, you published my book.

34:25.354 --> 34:28.524
If that isn't worth a little
petty larceny, I don't know what is.

34:30.651 --> 34:31.486
Penny?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.620
If the robot can't find us,

34:41.829 --> 34:42.914
I'm gonna find him.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.251
Good.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.025
Any idea what I'm looking at?

35:11.818 --> 35:12.902
Working on it.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.245
What is that?

35:22.703 --> 35:23.704
I don't know.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.421
It's large.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.090
Could be a meteor.

35:34.173 --> 35:37.093
Sure it is. Let me guess,
it's heading straight towards us.

35:37.593 --> 35:38.678
No, it isn't.

35:40.638 --> 35:41.639
What's wrong?

35:41.889 --> 35:44.183
Nothing.
It's not an alarm, it's a...

35:48.521 --> 35:49.939
it's an audio signature.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.234
Every ship has what is essentially
a sonic watermark

35:53.317 --> 35:55.319
so it can be identified in space.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.613
And so who does this one belong to?

35:59.031 --> 35:59.866
It's...

36:03.035 --> 36:03.995
It's the <i>Resolute. </i>

36:05.246 --> 36:07.248
-It's the <i>Resolute!</i>
- It's the <i>Resolute!</i>

36:07.331 --> 36:08.666
What? Is it close?

36:08.749 --> 36:11.586
No-- I mean, no, not particularly,
but we can get there.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.254
No way!

36:16.424 --> 36:18.092
Okay. Okay, okay.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.844
Come on, everybody. Strap in!

36:19.927 --> 36:21.596
- We're on the move!
- Let's go!
