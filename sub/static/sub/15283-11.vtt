00:06.790 --> 00:08.530
Traffic's looking pretty good
this afternoon for...

00:08.540 --> 00:09.780
ORANGE COUNTY, CA

00:09.790 --> 00:12.076
...your evening commute. This is John
Brown with your KMZA traffic report.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.036
Stay tuned for Southland sports,
coming up after this.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.492
Can't be late for my own party, Norman.
I gotta go.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.786
-You're going to have to meet me there.
-Okay.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.167
You're not going to wear that tie,
are you? Not one of my favorites.

00:31.210 --> 00:32.609
Don't forget to put the seat down.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.450
I'm in the middle of
the final walk-through...

02:07.460 --> 02:09.781
-Excuse me, miss? Excuse me.
-Yes.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.871
Wait, hold on one second.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.206
All right, I'm back.

02:22.170 --> 02:23.706
No. So, as I was saying...

02:37.580 --> 02:40.743
The principal's office called.
Yeah, plagiarism.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.997
Yeah, well, I was in the middle of

02:47.000 --> 02:49.662
closing on
the Ocean Park five-bedroom.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.916
And I'm telling you,
if I lose that commission,

02:55.920 --> 02:57.785
it is coming out of his college fund.

03:33.830 --> 03:36.617
And he comes back home at 5:30

03:36.620 --> 03:39.532
Gets the same train every time

03:39.540 --> 03:42.532
And he's oh so good

03:42.540 --> 03:45.498
And he's oh so fine

03:45.500 --> 03:48.162
And he's oh so healthy

03:48.170 --> 03:51.378
In his body and his mind

03:51.380 --> 03:54.918
He's a well-respected man about town

03:54.920 --> 04:00.415
Doing the best things so conservatively

04:00.420 --> 04:03.321
And his mother goes to meetings

04:03.330 --> 04:06.322
While his father pulls the maid

04:06.330 --> 04:09.242
And she stirs the tea with councilors

04:19.250 --> 04:21.912
What's gotten into you tonight

06:02.540 --> 06:04.371
"Every normal man
must be tempted

06:04.380 --> 06:06.575
"at times to spit on his hands,

06:06.580 --> 06:11.495
"hoist the black flag and begin
to slit throats." H.L. Mencken.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.748
This is
Orange County, California.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.036
Ten days ago, Judy Hannity,

06:18.040 --> 06:21.953
a real-estate worker and a mother,
was shotgunned on the 91 freeway.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.075
She survived this?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.492
Barely. She's paralyzed
from the waist down.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.912
The second and third victims
were both DOA.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.036
There were different vehicles
for each shooting.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.956
A small, black SUV. A black sedan.
A white sedan. No makes. No plates.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.611
-No solid witnesses?
-The first victim described the shooter

06:38.620 --> 06:41.578
as a "normal, middle-aged,
white guy in an SUV."

06:41.580 --> 06:43.957
She gave that description, but
she couldn't remember anything else?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.609
Isn't that consistent with trauma?

06:45.620 --> 06:49.704
Actually, no. Trauma victims
either remember everything or nothing.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.530
So, wait. The third victim
was shot last week,

06:51.540 --> 06:53.030
we just got the phone call today?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.076
Until the third shooting,
the locals weren't convinced

06:55.080 --> 06:57.742
it was a serial shooter.
There were different cars,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.287
and the first shooting,
there was a different weapon.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.201
It's the same weapon.

07:02.210 --> 07:05.418
The shot pattern on the second
and third one are much wider, though.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.241
He sawed off his shotgun.
It's the same shooter.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.070
He's evolving, and quickly.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.537
The media's already dubbed him
the "Road Warrior."

07:12.540 --> 07:14.417
That explains why
they wanted us there so quickly.

07:14.420 --> 07:15.569
What do you mean?

07:15.580 --> 07:18.617
This type of UnSub is the hardest
to catch. Totally impersonal victims.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.110
A third of the crime scene flees
with him in his vehicle.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.611
The victim's car is a wreck.
And the last third, the road,

07:23.620 --> 07:25.997
it's contaminated by all the other cars
that drive over it.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.322
-So how do we get him?
-We build a solid profile. We release it

07:29.330 --> 07:32.117
to the public with an appeal for help.
Somebody knows this guy.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.281
And it's my job to make them realize.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.283
Sheriff's Office
ORANGE COUNTY

07:43.120 --> 07:46.453
Thea Salinas, Sheriff's County
Homicide. I'm running the task force.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.282
I'm Special Agent Jordan Todd.
Special Agents Rossi, Hotchner,

07:50.290 --> 07:51.871
-Prentiss. ..
-Hey.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.029
...Morgan...
-Hi.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.200
...and that's Dr. Spencer Reid.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.326
Are these the vehicles
from the shootings?

07:56.330 --> 07:58.742
Did you set up the hotline?

07:58.750 --> 08:01.708
Like you asked. We have the local
stations putting the number out there.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.416
We're getting
about a dozen calls an hour.

08:03.420 --> 08:07.288
I'll alert the media to stand by
for our press conference. Excuse me.

08:07.290 --> 08:10.111
The Sheriff's Department and the CHP
are on TAC Alert.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.372
We've got choppers on
round-the-clock freeway patrol.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.452
Victims' vehicles with maps,
CSPs and bullet points.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.280
Everything we got on the case
is in this room.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.874
-Anything solid on the tip line?
-Usual nut jobs, crime buffs,

08:21.880 --> 08:23.370
bored senior citizens.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.280
Well, you've got everything
squared away.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.451
It's not me. It's the shooter.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.826
The DC has an endless supply
of three things.

08:29.830 --> 08:33.869
Freeways, news coverage
and blonde, female luxury-car owners.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.618
-People are pretty scared?
-I could ask for a submarine and get it.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.912
The MO in the first shooting differs
dramatically from the other two.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.410
Daylight on a crowded freeway.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.615
That's dozens of potential witnesses.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.111
-It's high-risk. He got luclq.
-Well, then he's a fast study.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.740
Sawed off his shotgun
and lowered his risk

08:53.750 --> 08:55.490
by switching to nights
and changing vehicles.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.321
What if he wasn't planning on murder
the first time?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.070
What, you think the first shooting
was spontaneous?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.537
Well, we know what he's capable of
when he plans ahead.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.077
If I'm not planning to commit a crime,
why not drive my own vehicle?

09:06.080 --> 09:11.370
So the SUV is his actual car. But then,
why did he have a gun in the SUV

09:11.380 --> 09:12.950
if he wasn't planning
to commit murder?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.246
And what happened
to make him pull that first trigger?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.161
We need to re-interview the first victim.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.661
Ms. Hannity, I'm Agent Aaron Hotchner.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.820
This is Agent Emily Prentiss.
We're from the FBI.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.037
She already told the police
everything she can remember.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.419
Rick, it's okay.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.455
Please.

09:43.460 --> 09:47.749
It's just the two of us.
He feels like it's his job to protect me.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.456
I understand _
you've spoken to the police.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.781
I just need to go back through
the shooting with you.

09:52.790 --> 09:57.033
-It only comes back in pieces.
-We can take it slowly.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.702
Just try to piece together your day,
if you can.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.997
Have you seen accidents
like this before?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.319
A few.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.371
And do people recover?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.416
The doctors said
she has a good chance.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.826
-It's my fault.
-No.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.821
This is no one's fault
but the man who shot your mother.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.206
I got in trouble at school.

10:24.210 --> 10:27.247
She was on her way there. She
shouldn't have even been in her car.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.030
So, you were angry?

10:33.210 --> 10:36.748
I don't know. I suppose.

10:37.380 --> 10:42.500
I know this is difficult, but every detail
helps us understand who this man is.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.574
Come on! Come on, move!

10:51.330 --> 10:52.991
I was impatient.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.411
And you cut him off?

10:57.710 --> 10:59.416
Was there anything else

10:59.420 --> 11:02.287
Did he honk

11:06.170 --> 11:08.877
_ -Excuse me.
-WaIt, hold on one second.

11:12.290 --> 11:15.111
-He tried to speak to me.
-What did he say?

11:21.670 --> 11:23.615
He couldn't say anything.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.997
I wouldn't give him a chance.

11:31.830 --> 11:34.742
What, now you want to talk about
your feelings, like you're some chick?

11:34.750 --> 11:36.820
You drive like an old lady.

11:37.120 --> 11:41.079
All right, I'm back.
No. So, as I was saying...

11:49.000 --> 11:53.778
If he hadn't seemed so normal,
I wouldn't have said anything.

12:02.290 --> 12:04.667
I usually don't even use my horn

12:06.120 --> 12:07.826
because on the road,

12:09.790 --> 12:11.371
you never know.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.957
I'll ask your son to come back in.

12:21.830 --> 12:23.457
Is she okay?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.742
She says you've been taking
very good care of her.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.287
-I guess so.
-She's lucky to have you.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.168
So, what happened?

12:38.420 --> 12:39.956
She made it personal.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.376
When the victimology's
this specific,

12:48.380 --> 12:49.699
we know the victims represent

12:49.710 --> 12:52.611
-a specific person to him.
-Who?

12:52.620 --> 12:56.169
Given the fact that he's the same age
and race as the victims, it's likely

12:56.170 --> 13:00.163
-a current or former wife or girlfriend.
-So why not just kill the actual person?

13:00.170 --> 13:02.456
She's just a scapegoat
for his own personal failings.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.577
He knows if he kills her,
he loses that scapegoat.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.071
So, he just goes around
blowing away any women?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.412
No, just women that
remind him of his wife.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.956
When this type of killer is triggered,

13:11.960 --> 13:13.530
they need to release
their resentment quickly.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.998
Subsequently, they tend to strike
close to the focus of that resentment.

13:17.710 --> 13:21.783
So, if the focus is his wife,
then that focus is his home?

13:22.880 --> 13:25.747
Yeah, he almost certainly
lives in this area.

13:25.750 --> 13:30.323
This is_ his kill zone. What are
these various markers everywhere?

13:30.330 --> 13:32.036
Road work.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.329
Judith Hannity said that he shot her
after she challenged him personally.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.321
Before that, he was almost apologetic.

13:43.330 --> 13:44.661
What's going on?

13:44.670 --> 13:46.456
Out of the 30 road work sites
in the kill zone,

13:46.460 --> 13:48.166
only two were alternate merges,

13:48.170 --> 13:50.286
both less than three miles
from the crime scenes.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.531
-Alternate merges?
-Multiple lanes funneled down to one.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.826
One car per lane alternating
at the driver's discretion.

13:54.830 --> 13:57.321
These sites allow him
to set up the confrontation.

13:57.330 --> 14:00.572
A guy who follows the rules may
lash out once, but to do it again,

14:00.580 --> 14:02.036
he'd need similar provocation.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.951
So he seeks out alternate merge sites,

14:03.960 --> 14:05.951
and he goes through them
over and over again, until he finds

14:05.960 --> 14:08.702
a woman that fits his victim type,
who cuts him off.

14:08.710 --> 14:10.746
So, we have to shut down
every alternate merge

14:10.750 --> 14:12.877
-in the county immediately.
-And we need to talk to the crews

14:12.880 --> 14:14.074
-that work these sites.
-Okay.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.741
So, what does all this tell you?

14:15.750 --> 14:18.378
Impersonal killers are like drug addicts.
The first time gives them

14:18.380 --> 14:20.666
the ultimate high, and after that,
no high is as good.

14:21.620 --> 14:24.202
Unfortunately,
the addict doesn't know that.

14:24.670 --> 14:28.208
He will chase that high to
the gates of insanity and death.

14:29.790 --> 14:32.998
By now, killing is
all our UnSub thinks about.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.161
He's set up the exact same situation
again and again,

14:38.330 --> 14:40.286
hoping to get the same result.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.911
He begins to think he's doing it wrong.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.663
He becomes obsessed with
improving his skills, honing his MO,

14:55.420 --> 14:58.662
and tailoring his weapon
to his deadly purpose.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.499
He figures if he gets them all just right,
if he can get his technique

15:06.500 --> 15:10.209
and his tools perfected,
he'll feel that first high again.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.611
He's becoming a more lethal addict.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.533
And he'll never accept that the high
is gone and it won't come back.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.701
He'll never stop. Never.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.246
Do you know
how many cars I see

15:33.250 --> 15:34.706
drive through my work site, here?

15:34.710 --> 15:36.701
Your boss said you were
the safety officer that night?

15:36.710 --> 15:37.825
So?

15:37.830 --> 15:39.036
So, that means you would have

15:39.040 --> 15:40.826
been holding the sign
to slow cars down.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.037
We're looking for
a man in a white sedan,

15:43.040 --> 15:45.747
and he would have come through
over and over again.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.820
The driver would have been
gorng extra slow,

15:47.830 --> 15:50.287
like he was daring anyone
to cut him off.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.742
-Hmm. Son of a bitch.
-You remember someone?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.069
Yeah, I thought
the guy was lost, though.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.709
I mean, I even talked to Tony about
this guy dressing like a hard-ass,

15:58.710 --> 16:00.416
but he drove like a chick.

16:00.420 --> 16:01.910
-No offense.
-None taken.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.820
What do you mean,
dressed like a hard-ass?

16:03.830 --> 16:07.038
This jackass was wearing a leather
jacket, he's got sunglasses on.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.248
They're mirrored, you know,
like the cops use. But it was dark out.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.707
He's starting to role play.
He's breaking from reality.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.701
Do you remember
anything else about this man?

16:14.710 --> 16:18.202
A car cut him off, and he stuck
his arm out across the front seat.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.950
But after that, I didn't see him
come through again.

16:19.960 --> 16:23.111
-Show me what he did with his arm?
-Like this.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.611
Like he was keeping a passenger from
hitting the dashboard?

16:25.620 --> 16:28.418
Yeah, but the dude was alone.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.536
Thanks for your time.
VICTOR: Sure.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.782
-What's wrong?
-A small SUV is a family vehicle.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.111
Between that and the hand gesture,
I'm afraid that our UnSub's

16:37.120 --> 16:40.203
-married with children.
-Why does that matter?

16:40.210 --> 16:43.748
Well, if he's breaking from reality
and he's lashing out at surrogates

16:43.750 --> 16:45.786
for his life,
then it's only a matter of time

16:45.790 --> 16:48.076
_ before he tries _
to wrpe out the real thing.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.072
Are you saying this guy's going to
kill his wife and kids?

16:51.080 --> 16:54.709
Call your people. We need to get
a profile out as soon as possible.

16:58.710 --> 17:01.702
The hyper-masculine disguise,
victim preference,

17:01.710 --> 17:04.497
and the emasculating trigger
of the first attack all tell us this is

17:04.500 --> 17:07.116
an UnSub suffering
a masculine identity crisis.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.169
A masculine identity crisis?
That's why he's driving around,

17:10.170 --> 17:13.662
-blowing women away?
-No, Judy Hannity was just the trigger.

17:13.670 --> 17:16.207
We need to identify
the precipitating trauma.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.667
Something happened in the UnSub's life.
Something so traumatic,

17:18.670 --> 17:20.991
it turned a normal man
into a serial killer.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.070
So, he's suffering from
some kind of psychotic break.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.287
Which means the world
he sees around him

17:25.290 --> 17:28.999
And that of his family.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.163
His perception of his home life is
the key to his pathology.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.570
At home, this UnSub feels
less than a man.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.707
A failure as a father and as a husband.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.617
He feels his children don't need
or respect him.

17:59.790 --> 18:02.611
And that he's unwanted
and obsolete in their lives.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.826
As a husband, he feels emasculated
and humiliated by his wife.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.496
Yeah, right. That would be good.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.411
Now these beliefs and perceptions,
real or imagined,

18:14.420 --> 18:17.162
have destroyed this individual's
masculine self-image.

18:18.170 --> 18:20.456
This UnSub is delusional.
He's now

18:20.460 --> 18:22.610
dressing in this Road Warrior persona.

18:23.210 --> 18:26.702
This gives him feelings of power
and purpose that he craves.

18:26.710 --> 18:29.031
It is now the single most important
thing in his life,

18:29.040 --> 18:33.488
-and he will die before giving it up.
-His new fantasy persona

18:33.500 --> 18:36.663
can't co-exist with the everyday reality
of his home life.

18:36.670 --> 18:39.707
Which means sooner _or later_
he's gomg to kill his entire family.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.996
Our strategy's three-fold.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.699
First, we find every small-modeled blue
SUV owner in the estimated kill zone.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.668
Two, we set up a single alternate merge
scenario in that zone,

18:49.670 --> 18:52.116
and we man it with our people.
And three, we release our profile

18:52.120 --> 18:54.611
to the public.
Somebody out there knows this man.

18:54.620 --> 18:55.780
They just don't realize it.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.165
Hey, Norman.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.207
Can you put this on my account?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.997
-Well, I'll need Mr. Manning's approval.
-Whenever you get around to it.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.412
I'm still waiting for last month's
expense summary, Norman.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.241
-I'm sorry.
-The guys on the sixth floor are asking

19:34.250 --> 19:37.378
No, I got it. I know I got it...

19:37.380 --> 19:38.745
I got it here somewhere.

19:38.750 --> 19:43.449
You're an old, bald loser
and everyone laughs at you.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.070
What did you say?

19:46.750 --> 19:48.069
I didn't say anything.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.782
Look, Norman. The sixth floor doesn't
care what's going on in your life

19:54.790 --> 19:58.328
or how long you've been with the firm.
They're all about the numbers.

19:58.330 --> 20:02.243
And the numbers tell them that younger
workers cost less and produce more.

20:03.710 --> 20:06.782
I like you, Norman. I know how hard
things have been for you these past

20:06.790 --> 20:10.578
few months, but don't give those
bastards on the sixth floor an excuse.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.377
You know what I mean?

20:14.120 --> 20:18.489
Yeah. Yeah. Here it is.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.915
Thanks.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.871
We ask the public
to listen very carefully

20:26.880 --> 20:29.280
to the following description.

20:29.290 --> 20:32.874
Anyone who believes they recognize
this individual should call

20:32.880 --> 20:36.168
our tip line immediately.
We are looking for a white,

20:36.170 --> 20:40.322
middle-aged, married father.
We believe his wife is blonde,

20:40.330 --> 20:45.996
approximately 40 years old, resembles
the victims and drives a luxury sedan.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.164
This individual drives
a blue, small-modeled SUV

20:50.170 --> 20:55.915
and most likely lives in this area.
It is also very possible this individual

20:55.920 --> 20:59.572
recently suffered a personal trauma
in his life.

20:59.580 --> 21:04.324
Be on the lookout
for a worthless loser named Norman

21:04.330 --> 21:07.663
who resents anyone with a life
and kills just to prove

21:07.670 --> 21:09.786
he's not an emasculated loser.

21:20.380 --> 21:25.283
It is very possible this individual
recently suffered a personal trauma

21:25.290 --> 21:30.284
in his life. Again, a white,
middle-aged, married father.

21:30.290 --> 21:34.374
We believe his wife is blonde,
approximately 40 years old,

21:34.380 --> 21:38.282
resembles the victims and
drives a luxury sedan. This...

21:38.290 --> 21:42.374
...do it to me. They do it to me,
and they do it to me. They do it to me.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.572
Why do they always do that to me?
I can't.

21:53.460 --> 21:56.873
Hey, buddy. Are you all right?

22:31.170 --> 22:34.708
Joe Karem and Timothy Calvert.
DOA. No wants. No warrants.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.782
They work in the area, and
detectives are notifying their families.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.530
Sawed-off 12-gauge.
Close range.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.167
Shot out of the driver's-side window.

22:41.170 --> 22:44.207
Driving a small, blue SUV. That's
our guy, but he went way off script.

22:44.210 --> 22:46.997
Multiple male victims. Surface street.
Daytime attack.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.285
And he drove his own vehicle.

22:48.290 --> 22:50.076
Something triggered him
and pissed him off.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.240
What time did this happen?

22:51.250 --> 22:54.538
20. Single witness
says that the shooter was driving

22:54.540 --> 22:59.284
a small, blue SUV. Didn't get a plate.
A middle-aged white guy, wearing a tie.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.917
Suit jacket hanging in the back.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.538
20. Jordan went on the air at 2:00.

23:04.540 --> 23:05.700
He was watching the news.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.951
_ You said the_UnSub
was g0ing to be watching the coverage.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.201
Twenty minutes from wherever
he was watching the press conference

23:10.210 --> 23:13.031
-to this intersection.
-He drives the speed limit.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.999
Taking into account red lights and
midday traffic, no more than 10 miles?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.707
-So, he lives within 10 miles of here.
-I don't think so.

23:19.710 --> 23:22.497
I don't understand. _ _
-We were wrong. He was wearing a tie.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.663
-Suit jacket hanging in the back.
-And considering the time of day...

23:25.670 --> 23:29.071
-He works in the area.
-I'm gomg to call GarCIa.

23:32.750 --> 23:33.910
Give it to me.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.319
Hey, baby,
can you pull up a map

23:35.330 --> 23:36.661
of the crime scene area for me?

23:36.670 --> 23:38.661
Sugar, I could shut down the power grid

23:38.670 --> 23:41.321
-to the whole city if you told me to.
-Yeah, I'm sure you can. Right now

23:41.330 --> 23:43.912
Ijust need you to highlight
a 10-mile radius around this point.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.320
Track any calls coming in
from this area to the tip line.

23:46.330 --> 23:47.820
Coordinate with Prentiss and Reid,
would you?

23:47.830 --> 23:50.492
-I am all over it.
-Thanks, baby girl.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.706
You think he's going to kill again soon,
don't you?

23:53.710 --> 23:57.168
-And he's done killing surrogates.
-Did you know?

23:57.170 --> 23:59.786
_ _ Excuse me.
This is not the time or the place.

23:59.790 --> 24:01.166
Are you going to do this
in front of the press?

24:01.170 --> 24:03.957
He killed those people
because of something I said.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.077
No, when we talk to the public,
it's always a possibility.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.379
That is part of the job.
Tell me now if you can do it or not.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.871
Damn right I can do this job.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.780
Good. You're about to give
another press conference.

24:16.210 --> 24:19.668
_ We're on the air
in three, two, one.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.373
We are prepared to release
to the public additional information

24:23.380 --> 24:26.998
about the individual responsible
for the freeway shooting.

24:27.790 --> 24:33.456
The individual is a white, 45- to
55-year-old male of average build.

24:33.880 --> 24:38.954
He works in this area.
He wears a suit and tie to work,

24:38.960 --> 24:44.409
00, immediately after watching

24:44.420 --> 24:48.663
our earlier statement about him. _
If anyone has any additional information

24:48.670 --> 24:52.572
please call our anonymous
tip line immediately. Thank you.

24:54.330 --> 24:55.661
One last thing.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.538
This individual has committed horrible
crimes and must be held to account,

25:00.540 --> 25:04.169
but he's a husband and a father.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.240
He's violent and he's troubled,

25:06.250 --> 25:10.038
but he must be capable of some
degree of mercy and compassion.

25:10.380 --> 25:13.497
And so, we appeal to him.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.497
Do not hurt any more people.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.702
Please, turn yourself in.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.787
Norman

25:41.710 --> 25:44.668
-I'm the Road Warrior.
-What?

25:45.460 --> 25:48.327
I'm the Road Warrior, the freeway
shooter. I thought I should tell you.

25:50.830 --> 25:54.709
Of course you are, clear.
And I'm the Zodiac Killer.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.246
And I'm the Zodiac Killer.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.819
What's so funny?

26:10.620 --> 26:13.248
Dad confessed. He's the Road Warrior.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.821
-You're such a dork.
-Yeah.

26:23.380 --> 26:24.699
What is the exact address?

26:26.750 --> 26:27.910
What have we got?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.321
You have no idea how many
middle-aged white men there are

26:31.330 --> 26:34.208
out there who have someone close to them
that think they're a serial killer.

26:34.210 --> 26:37.873
And you said that he saw the press
conference, right? Okay, thank you.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.115
Guys, I think we might have something.

26:41.420 --> 26:43.911
It's funny, when I heard the description
in the first press conference,

26:43.920 --> 26:45.239
I thought of Norman.

26:45.250 --> 26:49.368
But then I just thought,
it couldn't be, you know? He's so quiet.

26:49.380 --> 26:51.325
What is it that Mr. Hill
does for you here?

26:51.330 --> 26:54.618
He's in charge of the company's
travel expenses. This is his desk.

26:54.620 --> 26:57.168
Does he have access
to the company cars?

26:57.170 --> 26:58.376
Yeah, the whole fleet.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.450
What about the first press conference
made you think of Norman?

27:00.460 --> 27:03.202
The woman mentioned something
about him suffering a tragedy.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.530
Daddy, what's taking so long?

27:07.540 --> 27:09.781
Honey, Daddy will be done in a minute.
Just stay in the car, baby.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.030
I want to help.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.280
Jenny, get back in the car!

27:14.290 --> 27:16.167
Get back in the car! No!

27:23.830 --> 27:24.990
Uh...

27:25.000 --> 27:27.821
Six months. I really should have
done more to help him.

27:29.540 --> 27:33.783
Thank you. Norman's personnel file.

27:34.540 --> 27:37.452
-This address current?
- Should be.

27:37.460 --> 27:41.282
-Why does he have two files?
-We cross-reference married couples.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.450
I don't understand.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.416
Norman's wife, Vanessa, works here, too.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.458
-We need to speak to her.
- She's not here.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.873
She just got a promotion,
so she took a couple of weeks off.

27:55.830 --> 27:57.616
_ -Get in the car.
-I just got home from school.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.612
-Don't talk back to me.
-Norman, what's gomg on?

28:00.620 --> 28:04.374
You'll see. Everybody, now. I'm driving.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.575
Norman, what are you doing?

28:17.330 --> 28:19.321
-Norman! Slow down!
-No.

28:19.330 --> 28:22.072
-What do you mean, "No"?
-We have to get out of here.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.740
Dad, let us out of the car.

28:45.710 --> 28:46.995
Damn it.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.609
It's the police.

28:49.620 --> 28:51.611
Okay, Norman.
The police are behind us.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.451
-Shut up.
-"Shut up"?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.117
-The police should stay out of this.
-"Stay out of it"? You ran a stop sign,

28:58.120 --> 28:59.701
and you're going, like,
100 miles an hour.

28:59.710 --> 29:02.577
-This is family business.
-Family? You have to stop this!

29:02.580 --> 29:05.378
No. What we have to do is
we have to get out of here.

29:05.380 --> 29:09.703
-Please, Dad. This is crazy!
-Norman! Stop this car right now!

29:09.710 --> 29:12.281
Shut up! All of you, just shut up!

29:18.670 --> 29:20.615
Salinas. Where?

29:21.540 --> 29:25.374
We have a chase. Small-model SUV.
Blue. Driving recklessly.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.608
117th and Pacific.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.536
Morgan, we have a high-speed chase.

29:28.540 --> 29:30.781
117th and Pacific.
It sounds like our guy.

29:31.750 --> 29:34.241
All right, listen. We're closer to 117th,
so we're on our way now.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.957
We'll head over to the Hill house.
If he's having a break, he could be

29:36.960 --> 29:39.997
on his way there to finish it.
We're on our way. Be careful.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.240
Okay.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.530
Norman, please stop.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.241
We should have done this
a long time ago.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.287
-Done what?
-We can't move on living in that house.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.110
-I can't do it.
-Move on?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.782
I don't know how you could.
How you could keep

29:56.790 --> 30:01.238
looking at those same walls.
The same... The same pictures.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.956
Norman, what are you talking about?

30:02.960 --> 30:06.077
It's my job to make everything
right again.

30:11.620 --> 30:12.996
-Turn right here.
-Where, here?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.536
Right. Right. Turn right here.
Turn right here.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.075
I'm going to need
a little more notice than that, kid.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.570
Sorry. Sorry.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.998
Norman, please just tell me what's
happening. Why are you doing this?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.788
-Because I know that you blame me.
-Blame you?

30:34.790 --> 30:37.702
I see the way you all look at me.
I see it.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.247
-All right, left.
-Where?

30:44.250 --> 30:45.319
Next light.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.247
Norman, please. Just stop!

31:19.420 --> 31:21.240
Oh, my God! Where did you get that?

31:40.620 --> 31:41.780
I tried to tell you,

31:41.790 --> 31:45.112
but you wouldn't listen.
You just wouldn't listen.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.874
Repeat.
Shots fired. On the chase now!

31:48.880 --> 31:50.825
He's losing it. Reid, does it look like

31:50.830 --> 31:51.990
the chase could be headed
to his house?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.376
Yeah, I think so. It almost looks like

31:53.380 --> 31:55.496
he's starting to go in a wide circle
towards that direction.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.031
Okay, Emily. We're right outside it now.

32:17.420 --> 32:18.660
All units, pursuit now

32:18.670 --> 32:19.910
headed over Memorial Bridge.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.410
We're almost there.
Turn right at the next light.

32:27.290 --> 32:31.909
-Norman, where did you get that gun

32:31.920 --> 32:35.788
-What -You moved on.

32:35.790 --> 32:38.702
-I cry every day.
-Don't lie to me! You don't lie to me!

32:45.330 --> 32:46.570
Memorial Bridge is
around the next corner.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.069
Hold on! Hold on!

33:01.250 --> 33:03.377
-Are you good?
-Good. Go! Go!

33:12.540 --> 33:16.374
Vanessa Hill. FBI. Are you inside?

33:17.120 --> 33:20.954
-Maybe they went somewhere safe.
-Let's check around back.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.872
We can never be a family again
in that house.

33:30.880 --> 33:35.032
-We can never be a family anywhere.
-No. No, don't say that.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.248
-You let her die, Daddy.
-No, no, no. It wasn't my fault.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.786
Of course it was your fault!

33:39.790 --> 33:41.917
Please don't say that.
Just stop saying that.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.209
I wasn't there. Sasha wasn't there.
You had her and you let her die.

33:46.210 --> 33:48.576
Just shut up! Just shut up!

34:01.580 --> 34:04.242
'63 Aston Martin DB5.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.664
-James Bond. Goldfinger.-Guys?

34:16.170 --> 34:18.991
Reid, get on the radio and tell them
we're with the chase.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.076
This is the FBI
Behavioral Analysis Unit.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.661
We've caught up to the chase
and are now monitoring.

34:22.670 --> 34:24.820
We ask that if you're able
to stop the vehicle, you allow us

34:24.830 --> 34:27.071
to take the lead in contacting the driver,
as we believe him to be

34:27.080 --> 34:29.913
Copy.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.370
Split up.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.411
It was your fault.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.411
I'm sorry.

35:11.830 --> 35:14.037
You let my baby girl die.

35:20.210 --> 35:21.871
And you think I forgot?

36:01.080 --> 36:03.287
It was your fault.

36:04.040 --> 36:08.113
No, no, no, no, no.

36:26.460 --> 36:27.916
Guns down!

36:27.920 --> 36:30.787
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!
Guns down!

36:30.790 --> 36:34.908
Do not shoot! Do not shoot! Norman!

36:34.920 --> 36:36.069
-Norman, don't do it!
-What are you doing?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.741
-What are you doing?
-Don't move!

36:37.750 --> 36:38.990
My family's inside!

36:39.000 --> 36:40.615
Stop and listen to me.
-No, my family's...

36:40.620 --> 36:43.783
Listen to me! Nobody is in that car.

36:43.790 --> 36:46.577
-Nobody. ..
-Your family's gone, Norman.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.740
No, they're in there!

36:47.750 --> 36:51.242
They're gone, Norman. Look inside.
Look in the car.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.951
Look in the car. They were never there.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.280
It's over.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.916
They were never with you.

37:06.620 --> 37:08.326
No, but they were. They were...

37:47.250 --> 37:48.569
Your family is gone, Norman.

37:51.290 --> 37:56.705
Oh, God, what did I do My family!

37:57.540 --> 38:00.373
My family! I'm sorry!

38:01.330 --> 38:04.458
I'm sorry! My family...

38:05.460 --> 38:09.954
It's over, Norman. We're going to
get you some help. It's over.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.530
Let's go. Get up.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.660
Jordan?

38:32.040 --> 38:35.919
Did I do that

38:36.920 --> 38:42.415
No, kiddo. No way. They were gone
before we even got the case.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.327
We knew he would hurt his family.

38:45.330 --> 38:47.571
We just didn't know
that he already had.

38:51.210 --> 38:52.370
I don't...

38:55.710 --> 38:57.575
I'm not sure I can do this job.

39:00.710 --> 39:04.874
That's okay.
There's nothing wrong with that.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.372
"There's no tragedy in life
like the death of a child.

39:20.670 --> 39:25.824
"Things never get back to the way they
were." President Dwight Eisenhower.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.169
-You all right?
-I will be.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.746
Hey, you guys ever notice how
the trip home always

39:37.750 --> 39:39.377
seems to go so much faster?

39:39.380 --> 39:40.916
That's because the tailwinds are
in our favor.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.456
No, I meant because...

39:42.460 --> 39:44.371
Not really.

39:44.380 --> 39:46.200
You?
PRENTISS: No, not really.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.075
There's someone
in the BAU room, guys.

39:53.460 --> 39:56.372
-What are you doing here?
- JJ!

39:56.380 --> 39:59.417
Garcia said you guys were
on your way back tonight.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.786
-I thought you could use a surprise.
-Hi.

40:03.580 --> 40:07.573
I thought I gave you strict orders to get
this place out of your head for awhile.

40:07.580 --> 40:12.279
My bad. I couldn't help myself.
Here, I heated it up. Room temp, right?

40:14.210 --> 40:19.159
I just realized with all that we do
and see in this room, I never smiled.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.992
I wanted at least one good memory
to hold on to.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.666
Excuse me, kid.

40:25.830 --> 40:26.990
Um, JJ...

40:28.710 --> 40:29.779
Can I?

40:30.460 --> 40:34.829
-Yeah, of course.
-Okay, you've got to hold his head up.

40:35.670 --> 40:37.535
-Careful, careful.
-I got it. I got it. I got it.

40:37.540 --> 40:39.246
No, you... No, you don't got it.
You're smothering him.

40:39.250 --> 40:40.615
I do. Look, look. What's he doing

40:40.620 --> 40:43.748
He is smiling at Derek Morgan.

40:44.670 --> 40:46.114
-Gas.
-Gas.

40:47.380 --> 40:48.665
Give me that.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.451
Hey, little man.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.871
You're smiling.

41:00.170 --> 41:01.239
Gas.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.319
We miss you.
