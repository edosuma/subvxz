WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.100
Again?!

00:02.101 --> 00:03.750
What the hell is that sound?!

00:08.020 --> 00:11.400
While stopped at the ruins
of Utgard Castle to take a brief break,

00:12.820 --> 00:15.836
the Scouts were overwhelmed
by a Titan assault,

00:15.861 --> 00:18.184
vanquishing their hope of survival.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.369
...Nanaba...
...No! No!

00:20.370 --> 00:21.540
...And Gelgar...
...No! No!

00:21.870 --> 00:23.869
Father, stop!

00:23.870 --> 00:25.630
However, in that moment...

00:26.330 --> 00:27.210
Christa.

00:27.790 --> 00:31.400
This is nothing more than a hope of mine...

00:32.880 --> 00:35.620
I want you... to live
a life you're proud of.

00:37.260 --> 00:39.180
Ymir! Wait!

00:41.100 --> 00:43.980
...Ymir suddenly transformed into a Titan.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.900
Keep it up, Ymir!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.770
Want live...?

00:50.940 --> 00:52.360
Grab me!

00:59.070 --> 01:00.370
This looks bad.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.160
Ymir is...

01:05.040 --> 01:05.960
This can't...

01:06.670 --> 01:07.960
This can't...

01:08.420 --> 01:13.010
I still haven't told you my real name!

01:16.590 --> 01:20.140
And then the main force of the Scouts
rushed in to engage the enemy.

01:20.860 --> 01:21.680
Die!

01:26.270 --> 01:29.060
They successfully dismantled
the Titan attack.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.420
However,

01:34.070 --> 01:36.120
upon the ruins of battle,

01:36.680 --> 01:40.030
Eren and the others learn
a surprising truth.

01:41.950 --> 01:42.960
Ymir...

01:44.830 --> 01:46.210
My real name...

01:47.920 --> 01:50.130
...is Historia.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.290
Slowly!

03:57.130 --> 03:58.380
Bring it up slowly!

04:01.010 --> 04:02.420
Raise it carefully now!

04:10.470 --> 04:11.640
How's Ymir?

04:12.240 --> 04:14.270
What sort of shape is she in?

04:15.100 --> 04:16.940
Her right arm and leg were bitten off,

04:17.519 --> 04:20.060
and her insides are beaten
like scrambled eggs.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.200
If she was normal, she'd be dead for sure.

04:26.370 --> 04:28.870
If she was normal, huh?

04:38.130 --> 04:39.670
Reiner! Grab on!

04:40.250 --> 04:40.950
Right!

04:45.510 --> 04:47.010
Please, believe me!

04:47.470 --> 04:48.510
I'm telling the truth!

04:48.850 --> 04:53.390
Ymir transformed into a Titan
to fight off the other Titans and save us!

04:54.270 --> 04:57.499
She did so with no regard for her own life,

04:57.500 --> 04:59.940
which proves her loyalty
to us, her comrades!

05:00.610 --> 05:04.610
It's true that her judgement
until now is unforgivable.

05:05.110 --> 05:09.670
After all, she may know things useful to 
humanity and yet she kept quiet about it!

05:10.620 --> 05:14.950
I imagine she didn't say anything
in order to protect herself.

05:15.910 --> 05:18.250
But... now she's a changed person!

05:18.920 --> 05:21.160
Ymir is an ally of humanity!

05:21.550 --> 05:23.510
I know Ymir better than anybody.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.480
She's a much simpler person than she looks!

05:28.760 --> 05:29.630
I see.

05:30.890 --> 05:34.640
Obviously, I hope we can build
a trusting relationship with her.

05:35.520 --> 05:41.010
Her judgement aside, the information
she holds is a treasure for humanity.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.610
I hope we get along.

05:44.650 --> 05:45.580
But you know...

05:46.740 --> 05:48.960
...even if she is a simple person,

05:49.320 --> 05:52.790
this world becomes more of a
confusing mess with every passing day.

05:56.210 --> 05:59.670
You said... your real
name was Historia Reiss?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.660
Yes, that's right.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.760
Reiss, as in that noble family?

06:07.590 --> 06:08.420
Yes.

06:09.510 --> 06:10.240
I see.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.980
Nice to meet you, Historia.

06:18.810 --> 06:19.690
Yeah...

06:24.360 --> 06:25.320
How's Ymir?

06:25.990 --> 06:28.069
She's still in a coma.

06:28.070 --> 06:32.140
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think
steam is coming out of her wounds.

06:34.580 --> 06:39.430
For now, take her back to Trost
so she can get some proper medical care.

06:40.120 --> 06:40.970
She's in your hands.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.330
Understood.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.090
Now then...

06:47.670 --> 06:50.990
Our original mission...
was to seal this wall.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.200
Damn, it hurts.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.190
You all right, Reiner?

07:09.570 --> 07:11.160
Not by a long shot.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.490
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.530
That was... pathetic.

07:18.290 --> 07:19.410
I thought I was done for.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.679
Even someone as strong as you
gets this way sometimes.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.910
What are you talking about?
This is the second time for me!

07:35.300 --> 07:36.220
Tell him, Armin.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.420
Huh?

07:37.930 --> 07:41.440
Remember the time I almost
got crushed in that Titan's hand?

07:42.190 --> 07:43.230
Oh...

07:46.110 --> 07:47.160
Back then...

07:48.190 --> 07:50.680
That makes twice I've nearly died.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.680
At this rate, I'll be
dead before I know it.

07:55.030 --> 07:59.240
I picked this path on my own,
but being a soldier is rough.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.990
It's like a soldier's spirit
breaks down before their body.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.340
Though, until we plug up this wall,

08:08.920 --> 08:10.880
there's no time to waste whining about it.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.680
Yeah.

08:13.340 --> 08:16.840
You two have been driven
far enough away from your hometown.

08:17.850 --> 08:20.690
I'm thinking... this is where
we gotta draw the line.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.920
He's right, Reiner!

08:25.730 --> 08:27.480
Our hometown! Let's return!

08:28.270 --> 08:29.950
Isn't it about time to go back?

08:30.530 --> 08:34.320
Compared to all the trouble we've
been through, what's left to do is nothing!

08:35.950 --> 08:37.020
That's right.

08:37.490 --> 08:40.080
We're so close, it's just
another few steps till the end.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.830
Huh?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.490
What are you guys talking about?

08:50.710 --> 08:52.090
Thanks, Mikasa.

08:52.510 --> 08:53.450
Are you hurt?

08:53.970 --> 08:59.380
I'm fine, but... Reiner got his arm bit
and Ymir is as you can see.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.420
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?

09:04.060 --> 09:04.640
Does that...?

09:04.640 --> 09:05.190
Sasha.

09:06.810 --> 09:07.840
Is everyone clear?

09:08.440 --> 09:10.360
We'll deal with Ymir later.

09:11.070 --> 09:12.030
And Conny...

09:12.940 --> 09:16.659
I'll arrange for a Scout squad
to investigate your village later.

09:16.660 --> 09:20.460
For the time being, I want you to focus
on the mission to fix the wall.

09:21.120 --> 09:21.710
Got it?

09:22.040 --> 09:22.700
Got it!

09:24.120 --> 09:28.540
Still... I expected this place
to be swarming with Titans.

09:32.050 --> 09:32.900
Hannes?

09:33.840 --> 09:35.850
It's the Garrison's advance squad.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.390
They came to tell us where the hole is.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.600
There's no hole anywhere!

09:48.560 --> 09:49.080
Huh?

09:49.730 --> 09:51.660
We spent all night looking for it...

09:52.230 --> 09:55.134
...but at least between Trost
and Krolva District,

09:55.159 --> 09:57.264
there's nothing wrong with the wall.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.490
What'd you say?

09:59.410 --> 10:02.450
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva
and retraced our steps.

10:03.330 --> 10:06.050
We haven't seen any Titans
the whole way here.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.789
But... we know for sure there's Titans
on this side of the wall.

10:10.790 --> 10:14.339
Did you actually look?
Are you sure you're not drunk?

10:14.340 --> 10:15.669
I didn't drink!

10:15.670 --> 10:18.260
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?

10:29.270 --> 10:31.480
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.650
For now, we're falling
back to Trost District!

10:40.450 --> 10:42.590
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.220
We're going back ahead of you.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.620
There's nothing wrong with the wall?

10:54.380 --> 10:55.650
What could this mean?

10:56.800 --> 11:01.179
There's been nothing like this
in five years. Why is it all happening now?

11:01.180 --> 11:04.139
This world is getting more
and more out of hand.

11:04.140 --> 11:04.670
Eren.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.340
Have a minute?

11:07.930 --> 11:09.100
We need to talk.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.100
What about?

11:13.190 --> 11:17.990
Five years ago, we demolished the wall
and began our attack on humanity.

11:18.360 --> 11:22.909
Oh no... What if there's a Titan
that dug a hole underneath the wall?

11:22.910 --> 11:25.739
The hole will be hard to find in that case.

11:25.740 --> 11:29.249
I'm the Armored Titan
and he's the Colossal Titan.

11:29.250 --> 11:33.289
Right now, we need to focus
on getting Ymir back safely.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.950
Even with our horses,
we still have to worry about Titans.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.120
Huh?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.169
What are you talking about?

11:40.170 --> 11:42.469
Why are you telling him, Reiner?

11:42.470 --> 11:46.950
Our primary goal was to ensure
all of humanity was wiped out,

11:47.810 --> 11:50.400
but now there's no need for that.

11:50.850 --> 11:51.230
Uh...

11:51.710 --> 11:52.370
Eren.

11:52.940 --> 11:58.110
If you agree to come with us, we won't
have to destroy any more of the walls.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.530
Understand?

12:01.070 --> 12:01.610
Huh?

12:02.070 --> 12:04.949
No, wait! I don't understand at all!

12:04.950 --> 12:08.360
I'm saying... Why don't
you just come with us?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.470
I know this is sudden,
but we need to go now.

12:25.890 --> 12:28.350
Right now? Where will you take me?

12:28.850 --> 12:30.040
I can't say that yet.

12:30.890 --> 12:35.180
But... Well, it's something
like our hometown.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.189
So? What will it be, Eren?

12:38.190 --> 12:38.860
Uh...

12:39.110 --> 12:40.680
It's not a bad deal, right?

12:41.110 --> 12:42.960
You can easily avert this crisis.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.780
I wonder about that...

12:47.990 --> 12:50.300
Hey! We're leaving!

12:56.210 --> 12:58.130
What the hell?

12:58.630 --> 13:02.260
And here I thought I had
enough to think about yesterday...

13:08.890 --> 13:10.929
"12 hours earlier"

13:10.930 --> 13:11.520
Eren?

13:12.640 --> 13:14.310
What is it, Section Commander?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.309
Oh, well...

13:17.310 --> 13:22.860
I was finally able to get my hands on
the background report for Annie Leonhart.

13:24.530 --> 13:25.530
Annie's?

13:25.530 --> 13:26.200
Yeah.

13:26.780 --> 13:29.460
It's taken so long to get
it because managing

13:29.485 --> 13:31.814
these reports is such a mess right now.

13:32.290 --> 13:33.160
According to this,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.769
there were two others belonging to the

13:36.770 --> 13:39.980
104th Cadet Corps who came
from the same area as her.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.600
And those two are...

13:44.720 --> 13:47.970
...Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.730
Thanks to the chaos five years ago,

13:58.190 --> 14:02.010
pretty much all of their family
records are spotty or missing.

14:02.780 --> 14:03.360
However...

14:04.570 --> 14:10.119
During the long-range scouting formation,
their unit was given false information.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.350
They were among those purposely told
that Eren was in the right wing.

14:17.330 --> 14:20.249
The Female Titan attacked
from the right wing!

14:20.250 --> 14:22.419
Huh? What does that mean?

14:22.420 --> 14:26.719
That it's possible they passed on
that information to Annie...

14:26.720 --> 14:28.719
Why? Why would they tell Annie?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.589
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.

14:30.590 --> 14:31.510
You can't just...

14:31.511 --> 14:32.850
I know that, Eren.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.110
By itself, that's not
enough to prove anything.

14:37.730 --> 14:42.050
So just in case, I'd like to hear from you
how these three interacted during training.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.320
Know anything?

14:45.400 --> 14:48.819
I knew Reiner and Bertholdt
were from the same place, but...

14:48.820 --> 14:50.570
...they didn't seem close to Annie.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.779
I agree.

14:52.780 --> 14:57.080
I don't recall ever seeing the pair
talking to Annie that much.

14:57.710 --> 15:00.830
Well, Annie didn't talk
much in the first place.

15:01.500 --> 15:06.110
When we ate, Annie would always sit alone
and munch on food by herself.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.549
Oh! I've got something!

15:08.550 --> 15:12.430
I heard a rumor she liked sweets,
even though she looks so grouchy!

15:13.220 --> 15:14.200
I...

15:15.240 --> 15:16.310
don't remember.

15:16.810 --> 15:17.850
But...

15:18.100 --> 15:21.580
As their comrade,
I'd find it hard to believe.

15:22.190 --> 15:24.439
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.553
Reiner is like everyone's big brother,

15:26.578 --> 15:29.414
and he's not devious
enough to deceive all of us.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.510
I agree.

15:33.070 --> 15:37.039
Reiner gave everything he had
fighting the Female Titan with me.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.220
He would have gotten crushed
in her hand if he hadn't...

15:41.920 --> 15:42.580
What's wrong?

15:44.170 --> 15:46.430
Reiner managed to escape, but...

15:47.420 --> 15:50.299
...Annie suddenly changed her course...

15:50.300 --> 15:52.590
...and ran in the direction of Eren.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.210
I...

15:55.930 --> 15:59.970
I did mention that Eren might be
at the rear of the center rank.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.600
But Annie was too far away to hear...

16:02.980 --> 16:03.980
Seriously?

16:05.980 --> 16:09.610
Did Reiner seem overly interested
in Eren's location?

16:13.610 --> 16:16.650
Then... Where the hell is Eren?

16:18.660 --> 16:19.790
It can't be...

16:23.920 --> 16:26.200
I only started talking
about Eren's position...

16:27.170 --> 16:29.590
...because Reiner was the one
who asked about it first.

16:31.630 --> 16:32.880
Furthermore...

16:33.680 --> 16:37.809
...when that happened, the Female
Titan was staring at her palm.

16:37.810 --> 16:41.060
He might have written a message
with his blades in her hand.

16:43.190 --> 16:44.400
Reiner could've...

16:53.740 --> 16:55.240
What the hell?

16:55.580 --> 16:57.820
Why are you saying things like this?

16:58.200 --> 16:58.660
...You should...

16:58.660 --> 16:59.270
...Eren!
...You should...

17:00.700 --> 17:02.620
No... Everyone, listen up!

17:03.290 --> 17:05.679
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt,

17:05.680 --> 17:08.380
act in such a way as to not
reveal any suspicions.

17:09.089 --> 17:12.990
Of course, do not make any mention
of Annie Leonhart either.

17:13.589 --> 17:16.638
Regardless if they're
Annie's accomplices or not,

17:16.640 --> 17:19.890
we need to lead them
deep underground and confine them.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.269
Does everyone understand?

17:22.270 --> 17:22.930
Yes!

17:32.820 --> 17:35.030
You're just tired, aren't you?

17:35.900 --> 17:37.240
Right, Bertholdt?

17:37.660 --> 17:40.310
You've been through so much,
it's making you crazy.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.699
Y-Yeah.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.540
Reiner's just really tired.

17:45.500 --> 17:50.120
Besides, if you were really the Armored
Titan that wants to destroy humanity...

17:50.540 --> 17:53.050
...why would you be asking me
this in the first place?

17:54.420 --> 17:59.210
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?

18:10.860 --> 18:11.830
Oh, right.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.590
That's right.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.500
What the hell was I thinking?

18:19.820 --> 18:22.080
Have I really gone crazy?

18:25.370 --> 18:26.790
Come on, let's go.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.410
I see...

19:01.450 --> 19:02.420
That's it.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.170
I've been here too long for my own good.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.740
It's been three long years...

19:12.470 --> 19:14.450
surrounded by nothing but idiots.

19:15.750 --> 19:19.450
We were just kids... We
didn't know anything.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.690
If only I never knew that
there were people like this...

19:26.140 --> 19:27.350
I...

19:28.680 --> 19:30.380
...wouldn't have become...

19:31.440 --> 19:34.060
...such a half-assed piece of shit!

19:36.480 --> 19:40.440
It's too late now...
I don't know what's right anymore.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.050
But the only choice for me now...

19:44.700 --> 19:47.410
...is to face the consequences
of my actions...

19:49.200 --> 19:50.570
...and as a warrior...

19:51.580 --> 19:54.210
...fulfill my duty to the bitter end!

19:59.840 --> 20:00.590
Reiner!

20:00.880 --> 20:03.719
Are we doing it?! Now?! Right here?!

20:03.720 --> 20:04.470
Yeah.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.090
We settle this... right here, right now!

20:21.030 --> 20:21.740
Eren!

20:22.070 --> 20:22.860
Run!

20:26.450 --> 20:27.490
Bertholdt!

20:33.580 --> 20:35.750
Eren! Get out of there!

21:15.540 --> 21:17.020
Ymir!

21:20.890 --> 21:21.590
Eren!

21:36.060 --> 21:38.110
I'm going to return
to the hometown we lost.

21:38.940 --> 21:41.780
That's all I care about now.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.860
Bertholdt...

21:51.240 --> 21:52.270
Reiner...

21:57.460 --> 22:02.020
You damn traitors!

22:07.727 --> 22:10.927

The Colossal Titan...

23:44.190 --> 23:48.120
...as well as the Armored Titan,
engage the Scouts in battle.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.811
If their mission is to exterminate
all of humanity,

23:53.836 --> 23:57.144
there is no turning back for them now.

23:58.410 --> 24:01.430
Reiner and the others devote
their lives to the mission...

24:02.210 --> 24:03.960
...because they are warriors.
