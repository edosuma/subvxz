00:00.968 --> 00:01.902
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:01.935 --> 00:05.439
Welcome to the grand
opening of club Ry Ri.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.441
Did our lead singer
just lose her voice?

00:07.475 --> 00:09.277
People are gonna
know it's me.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.379
Not with this!

00:11.412 --> 00:12.580
Who was
that masked girl?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.582
Which one of you
is responsible for this?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.617
It was all me.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.721
What do you think
she's saying?

00:20.754 --> 00:23.157
That he's in trouble
for putting on a concert.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.392
Poor guy.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.826
I feel so bad for--

00:25.859 --> 00:27.828
Hey, we're
blowing up online!

00:27.861 --> 00:29.563
Let me see that.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.066
Yes, people
love our clothes!

00:32.100 --> 00:34.735
Someone just commented,
"Where can I steal their look?"

00:34.768 --> 00:38.206
Someone wants to
steal my look, that's sick!

00:38.239 --> 00:40.708
Corki, a lot of these
comments are about you!

00:40.741 --> 00:42.510
What, I don't want
comments about me.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.845
Well, it's not exactly
you, it's Masked Girl.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.447
You already
have a fan page!?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.848
So, I have
three fan pages.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.650
Yeah, but you
made all of them.

00:49.683 --> 00:50.851
That's right.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.286
I'm well-liked
and hardworking.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.488
What if people figure
out Masked Girl is me?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.490
They know I hang
out with you guys.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.691
They've seen us
perform together.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.194
Who cares,
we're a hit!

01:00.228 --> 01:01.862
I mean,
don't worry.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.734
We'll figure out how to
keep your identity a secret.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.536
Waiting for your
partner in crime?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.538
I told you,
it was all my idea.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.672
So you claim.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.875
I'll see you
in a moment.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.843
Leave!

01:19.247 --> 01:22.416
As for you girls, you can't
imagine how delighted,

01:22.450 --> 01:25.719
I was to be summoned to a roller
rink by the Fire Department.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.356
Oh good, we thought
you were mad.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.260
Oh, sarcasm.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.628
Students holding
an illegal concert --

01:34.662 --> 01:36.564
this was a first for
MacKendrick Prep.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.166
Since when
is music illegal?

01:38.199 --> 01:40.468
It's not,
but overcrowding is.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.470
This incident even
made the local paper.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.471
We made
the paper?!

01:43.504 --> 01:45.239
People still
read those?

01:45.273 --> 01:48.376
"Masked Girl Sells
Out Roller Rink?"

01:48.409 --> 01:49.810
Since Caleb
took the blame,

01:49.843 --> 01:52.146
he will be punished with
some delightful chores

01:52.180 --> 01:53.214
around the school.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.816
That means they're not
delightful, I get it now.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.219
I know you girls
are mixed up in this.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.787
It's always you four.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.556
I'm particularly
disappointed in you, Corki.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.693
Right, Ms. Diona,
sure you are.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.494
Um, Corki?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.229
She's not being
sarcastic anymore.

02:08.262 --> 02:08.862
Oh.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.376
The principal hates me,
I have no future.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.312
Aren't you being a
bit melodramatic?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.514
Why, because
my life is over?

02:26.547 --> 02:27.848
That would be a "yes".

02:27.881 --> 02:30.584
Valerie Graves for
Homecoming Queen--

02:30.618 --> 02:32.920
Oh, it's you guys.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.322
(clears throat)

02:34.355 --> 02:36.557
Excuse me.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.392
Homecoming, was that in
the Student Handbook?

02:38.426 --> 02:41.395
It's tradition a bunch of people
come back to their old schools

02:41.429 --> 02:43.597
to talk about how perfect
they used to be.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.799
There's a dance and a
big football game.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.302
It's basically a chance
for the most popular kids

02:48.336 --> 02:50.638
to congratulate
themselves on being popular.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.506
Sounds like
my nightmare.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.310
I was wrong.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.679
That is
my nightmare!

03:02.583 --> 03:05.686
* Make it pop,
woo, woo *

03:05.719 --> 03:11.392
* Make it pop,
woo, woo *

03:11.425 --> 03:16.230
* I can't wait no,
I can't wait, can't wait *

03:16.264 --> 03:19.667
* So make it pop, we're bout to,
we're bout to blow *

03:19.700 --> 03:22.870
* Until we drop, oh ya,
we're ready to go *

03:22.903 --> 03:26.006
* Ain't gonna stop,
when is it time for the show *

03:26.039 --> 03:28.809
* We make it, you make it,
they make it *

03:28.842 --> 03:31.245
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:32.780 --> 03:36.350
* Great idea alert

03:36.384 --> 03:38.552
I'm gonna perform at the
Homecoming dance this year,

03:38.586 --> 03:41.555
So Mr. Stark will see
I'm a perfect Dorothy for

03:41.589 --> 03:43.891
the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.428
That sounds like an impulsive
and poorly thought-out plan.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.762
Thank you.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.299
I was thinking about
asking Caleb to the dance.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.536
I mean,
not like a date.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.970
Just to take
the pressure off.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.444
This way I won't have
the drama of worrying

04:03.477 --> 04:06.780
or waiting for
someone to ask me.

04:06.814 --> 04:10.818
So, Caleb.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.286
You know?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.621
Makes perfect
sense, right?

04:16.790 --> 04:18.025
Somebody
say something.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.795
Phase One of your punishment is
cleaning the cafeteria kitchen.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.597
Wait, there's more
than one phase?

04:23.631 --> 04:24.798
Yes, Caleb.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.435
You don't break a rule and
get a single phase punishment.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.871
That's the first thing they
teach us in principal school.

04:30.904 --> 04:34.074
Okay but, how many phases
are we actually looking at here?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.776
I'd have to check
my spreadsheet.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.578
Now get to work.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
Okay.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.056
(banging)

04:49.089 --> 04:51.992
Oh, uh, okay.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.628
Yes.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.096
What?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.965
Not here,
not here, not here.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.401
Oh, ugh!

05:00.434 --> 05:04.071
"Hey Caleb, want to go
to the dance with me?

05:05.072 --> 05:07.508
Oooh, ugh, ugh!

05:07.541 --> 05:09.543
Just as friends,
of course.

05:09.577 --> 05:13.046
You know -- check out
the music and fashions."

05:13.080 --> 05:14.682
No, that's stupid.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.818
Oh, uhh!

05:17.851 --> 05:19.620
Aaaah.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.089
I'm leaving now.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.692
I hear the Masked Girl
is a famous pop star.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.895
I hear she's the daughter of a
brain surgeon and a beat poet.

05:27.928 --> 05:32.566
I hear she was sent from outer
space to save the environment.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.904
Okay I didn't hear that,
I just get so worried

05:36.937 --> 05:38.739
about the environment.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.145
This is going to be a
very competitive year.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.714
Oh, don't worry.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.481
(scoffs)

05:47.515 --> 05:49.517
Not for me,
but for the girls.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.452
There's a lot of potential
already here.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.120
Not to mention this
mysterious Masked Girl

05:53.153 --> 05:55.523
everyone's talking about.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.790
Corki.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.925
Yes?

05:57.958 --> 06:00.461
We were just talking about
Masked Girl, any thoughts?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.662
No.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.666
She just seems like, a nice
girl who values her privacy.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.701
Is everything okay?

06:07.735 --> 06:10.471
Oh, right. this whole
clique thing.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.740
Look guys,
let's all get along.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.543
We should be focusing on
fighting the real enemy.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.945
The lack of a male
lead in the school play.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.813
What do you say,
friends?

06:19.847 --> 06:20.548
Of course!

06:20.581 --> 06:21.915
Sure!

06:21.949 --> 06:23.484
I don't know.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.085
Look, Corki, you're
can't hold a grudge

06:25.118 --> 06:26.854
for more than
three days.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.921
That's a rule.

06:27.955 --> 06:28.856
Really?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.859
Who makes these rules?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.094
I do.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.529
Caleb: All right,
Phase Two.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.098
(rumbling)

06:41.669 --> 06:42.102
Hmph!

06:45.773 --> 06:47.407
(rumbling)

06:49.877 --> 06:51.111
(grunting)

06:51.144 --> 06:53.481
(rumbling continues)

06:58.218 --> 07:01.655
"Hey Caleb, I like
that we're just friends

07:01.689 --> 07:05.092
and there's absolutely no
romantic tension between us.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.694
Wanna go to
the dance me?"

07:06.727 --> 07:08.796
Urrgh, why is
this so hard?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.531
Oh.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.098
(cough)

07:11.131 --> 07:12.299
Ugh, Jodie.

07:12.332 --> 07:15.536
Before you get any closer,
I feel an obligation to tell you

07:15.569 --> 07:18.205
I'm covered in toilet water
right now, okay.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.911
(sighing)

07:27.047 --> 07:29.016
Corki, have you given
any thought to running

07:29.049 --> 07:30.518
for Homecoming Court?

07:30.551 --> 07:31.051
Me?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.185
No.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.122
I'm more of a "running for
Supreme Court" kinda girl.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.958
Besides, isn't it just
a popularity contest?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.160
Yes, that's why it's
so fun to win.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.762
You know how impressive
Homecoming Queen

07:41.795 --> 07:43.731
looks on college
applications, don't you?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.265
But it's
not academic.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.836
Smart is easy,
cool is hard.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.172
Colleges are looking at the
well-rounded student these days.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.942
Hmm, I think I saw
that on a blog somewhere.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.478
But I stopped reading because
I was neglecting my calculus.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.148
Homecoming is about
more than just school.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.984
It's about prestige
and life experience.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.686
That would
make my father proud.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.891
One thing, cool
kids don't take notes.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.093
How do you learn if
you don't take notes?

08:13.126 --> 08:17.130
Sometimes the price of being
cool is not learning anything.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.766
Heather, what's the
capital of Thailand?

08:18.799 --> 08:19.933
A cat.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.001
Pretty cool, right?

08:29.142 --> 08:33.146
* Why d'ya think you
got to be better *

08:33.180 --> 08:34.147
* Who said

08:34.181 --> 08:39.052
* Who said that you
need to go and change *

08:39.086 --> 08:42.890
* Can't you find a
tighter sweater *

08:42.923 --> 08:44.191
* Well we say

08:44.224 --> 08:49.162
* Come with us and
learn the game *

08:49.196 --> 08:51.732
* Don't listen,
don't you listen *

08:51.765 --> 08:54.101
* Come with us
we're on a mission *

08:54.134 --> 08:59.139
* You should be
yourself and glisten now *

08:59.172 --> 09:01.809
* There's a way you
should be talking *

09:01.842 --> 09:04.044
* Follow us the
way we're walking *

09:04.077 --> 09:09.082
* If you want that cute
boy callin' you ooo oo *

09:09.116 --> 09:11.685
* Don't listen to a
word they're saying *

09:11.719 --> 09:14.154
* We'll be 5-star
hotel staying

09:14.187 --> 09:18.258
* 80 million hits
And playing, too *

09:18.291 --> 09:21.762
* The rules, ow ow ow

09:21.795 --> 09:26.333
* The, the rules,
ow ow ow *

09:26.366 --> 09:29.069
* The, the rules

09:29.102 --> 09:32.906
* Now they want your
lips to be redder *

09:32.940 --> 09:39.146
* And they say O-M-G
your skirt's too long *

09:39.179 --> 09:42.883
* Come with us and the
boys will be better *

09:42.916 --> 09:44.217
* Yeah, we say

09:44.251 --> 09:49.189
* Come with us and
it's game on (game on) *

09:49.222 --> 09:51.692
* Don't listen,
don't you listen *

09:51.725 --> 09:54.127
* Come with us
we're on a mission *

09:54.161 --> 09:59.166
* You should be
yourself and glisten now *

09:59.199 --> 10:01.702
* There's a way you
should be talking *

10:01.735 --> 10:04.171
* Follow us the
way we're walking *

10:04.204 --> 10:09.209
* If you want that cute
boy callin' you ooo oo *

10:09.242 --> 10:11.712
* Don't listen to a
word they're saying *

10:11.745 --> 10:14.181
* We'll be 5-star
hotel staying *

10:14.214 --> 10:18.385
* 80 million hits
and playing, too *

10:18.418 --> 10:21.755

10:35.769 --> 10:36.436
* Oooh

10:36.469 --> 10:38.138

10:38.171 --> 10:40.974
* The rules

10:41.008 --> 10:42.910
Okay,
catch ya later!

10:42.943 --> 10:44.344
Bye-ee!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.382
Did you just say,
"bye-ee?"

10:49.416 --> 10:51.018
O-M-G you guys.

10:51.051 --> 10:55.022
Valerie and the Spirit Squad
girls are so nice.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.824
Stop talking
like that.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.760
Is this the same Valerie who
stole Jodi's dance moves

10:59.793 --> 11:01.461
and tried to
destroy our reps?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.864
You're not allowed to hold
grudges for more than

11:03.897 --> 11:05.432
like three days.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.100
It's totes rule.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.137
Besides, you need to see
this other side of Valerie.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.439
She has a lot of really
interesting ideas

11:12.472 --> 11:14.808
about the pitfalls
of uniqueness.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.012
Corki, are you
feeling okay?

11:19.046 --> 11:20.180
I feel great.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.150
Which is why I've decided
to run for Homecoming Queen.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.055
You?

11:28.088 --> 11:28.956
Run for
Homecoming Queen?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.758
I thought you were
like super-private.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.360
Well, Jer and Val were like,
it'll totally get you

11:33.393 --> 11:36.329
into college, and I was
like, amazeballs!

11:36.363 --> 11:37.464
Is that
even English?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.933
Corki, you have to stop
hanging out with these people.

11:39.967 --> 11:40.968
Why?

11:41.001 --> 11:43.336
Being socially well-rounded
is like important.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.106
Not with Valerie!

11:46.139 --> 11:49.242
I'm, like, giving Valerie
the benefit of the doubt.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.812
Everyone makes
mistakes, riiiiiight?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.915
I've never been able
to identify with that.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.386
I don't get why you'd want
to hang around those people,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.890
but if it makes you
happy to run for the Court,

12:02.923 --> 12:04.024
go for it.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.325
I'll even
make your dress.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.128
Thanks, Jodi.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.262
I'd love that.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.164
You're both
being ridiculous.

12:11.198 --> 12:15.268
Corki, If you want to be
popular, take your mask off.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.337
No way,
homecoming is one thing.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.141
My dad would never approve
of me being in a pop band.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.112
Some parents just don't have
their priorities straight.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.917
One more turn of the screw,
this air conditioner

12:29.950 --> 12:31.384
will be cooler than me.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.789
(air conditioner humming)

12:35.823 --> 12:37.424
It worked, yes!

12:39.960 --> 12:41.294
Warm air?

12:44.031 --> 12:44.932
Warmer?

12:46.033 --> 12:46.900
Woah!

12:51.038 --> 12:52.505
Caleb,
what happened?

12:56.877 --> 13:00.447
Let's just say, it is
possible to be too hot.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.082
I need
an ice bath.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.187
Beautiful hot pink
homecoming dress.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.156
This is the one
I'm going with.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.390
It's Salmon Pink.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
I'm making a bold
choice this year --

13:12.425 --> 13:14.895
Shocking Pink!

13:14.928 --> 13:17.497
My dress is being
custom made by a designer.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.900
Ouuu, which one?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.534
Jodi Mapa.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.570
You know,
my roommate?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.405
She's super talented.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.344
Have you asked
Caleb to the dance yet?

13:31.378 --> 13:34.481
I'm rethinking
my approach.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.916
He's a safety hazard.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.155
So like, how far along
are you with my dress?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.924
Design is done.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.392
What do you think?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.359
Ahhh, no!

13:46.393 --> 13:47.427
Okay, that
was honest.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.031
It has to be fitted,
mini, and most of all pink.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.499
Oh, I'd look
good in that.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.134
It's going to be
flowing, elegant,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.335
and most of all green.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.970
Oh, I'd look
good in that.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.072
Just make it
like this, Jodi.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.377
If you want to order some boring
designer dress off the internet,

14:04.411 --> 14:05.078
go right ahead.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.346
But that's
not what I do.

14:06.379 --> 14:11.018
Can I just show you how great
your dress would look in pink?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.519
Don't ruin my design!

14:13.186 --> 14:15.488
I wouldn't dream
of ruining it.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.025
I just want to make
it totally different

14:18.058 --> 14:19.993
than you envisioned
that's all.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.131
Here's the truth,
my design is great.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.199
It's your new
friends who are lacking.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.301
If I could
just show you.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.269
No!

14:29.302 --> 14:30.503
(ripping)

14:32.205 --> 14:33.974
You know what?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.142
Forget it.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.109
I'm done.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.416
Great news,
I'm off chore duty.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.119
Guess who set a new record
for safety code violations?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.121
Now we can get
back to band stuff!

14:48.155 --> 14:49.923
This might not
be the best time.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.623
Why not?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.626
I think we just
broke up again.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.502
Can you believe a freshman
thinks she has a chance

15:02.535 --> 15:04.337
to be Homecoming Queen?

15:04.371 --> 15:07.007
Technically she
does have a chance.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.178
But it's hilarious Corki
thinks she could ever beat you.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.581
Valerie: I know, who
does she think she is?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.666
Caleb: Oh, hey!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.202
Oh, it's just
you guys.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.603
Sorry to
disappoint you.

15:36.636 --> 15:40.240
No, I was hoping Corki
would change her mind.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.743
She and her new friends
have higher priorities now.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.446
Like hair, makeup,
and gossip.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.416
Although, to be fair, those
things are very important.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.554
Well, I guess we should get
ready for the show, Jodi.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.357
I always knew
we were a duo, Sun-Hi.

16:03.196 --> 16:07.534
Okay, this is too
awkward, even for me.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.636
Which is
saying something.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.338
You guys,
I'm so sorry.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.172
You were right.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.240
Ha, I knew it!

16:13.273 --> 16:15.708
I overheard Valerie and
Heather making fun of me.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.512
You guys are my
true friends, I'm sorry.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.747
Can you forgive me?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.019
Oh okay!

16:26.053 --> 16:29.456
Who will proofread
my blogs if I don't?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.823
Thank you.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.526
You guys told me the truth
even when it was hard to hear.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.594
Totes!

16:36.063 --> 16:37.564
That's what
real friends do.

16:40.300 --> 16:48.275

* Let's do it again do,

18:52.299 --> 18:58.305
(cheering)

18:58.338 --> 19:01.708
Masked Girl!

19:01.741 --> 19:11.751
Everyone: Masked Girl!

19:11.784 --> 19:17.156
Everyone: Masked Girl!

19:23.730 --> 19:26.233
Corki!

19:26.266 --> 19:27.099
Where are you going?

19:27.133 --> 19:28.868
I think Jared might've
figured it out.

19:28.901 --> 19:29.802
The mask?

19:29.836 --> 19:33.906
He-- I don't--
who knows!

19:33.940 --> 19:35.808
But I have to
get out there!

19:35.842 --> 19:37.877
Did I miss the
band again?

19:37.910 --> 19:39.579
Darn it!

19:39.612 --> 19:40.580
There you are!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.215
I need to
talk to you.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.817
I don't really feel like
talking right now, Jared.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.420
Corki, please.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.556
I know.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.823
You know?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.725
How could you
possibly know?

19:52.759 --> 19:55.328
I saw Heather and Valerie
making fun of you.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.629
That was not cool.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.332
Oh, that.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.269
Yeah, I'm starting to realize
that high school is a lot

20:02.302 --> 20:04.637
more complicated
than I thought it was.

20:04.671 --> 20:08.275
Well, I'm sorry if I
put you in that position.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.377
Can you
ever forgive me?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.581
It's a shame I've got
such a striking face.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.982
I'd love to
wear a mask.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.018
So mysterious.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.389
Yup, I like the idea of my
band members being anonymous.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.023
Sounds like you
want us invisible.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.259
No, never crossed
my mind.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.461
At least you're finally calling
us band members instead

20:28.495 --> 20:29.696
of music assistants.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.267
How'd it go
with Jared?

20:34.301 --> 20:35.535
Ahh, Jared.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.870
Yeaaaaah.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.939
Not sure what
that answer was.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.777
Corki, does Jared know
it's you in the mask?

20:44.811 --> 20:45.845
No.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.515
Did something else
happen in your talk with him?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.016
Yes.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.484
No way!

20:51.518 --> 20:53.486
Jared and Corki?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.789
Or is it Jared and--

20:56.823 --> 20:58.325
Masked girl

20:58.358 --> 20:59.792
My new wallpaper!!

21:00.092 --> 21:06.866
(alarm sounding)

21:06.899 --> 21:09.469
Excuse me,
what seems to be the--

21:09.502 --> 21:11.003
Pardon me,
could you tell me--

21:12.972 --> 21:14.507
Is something happening

21:14.541 --> 21:17.977
that'll result in the
appearance of a news team?

21:18.010 --> 21:20.980
And if so,
do I look fabulous?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.050
What is wrong
with these people?

21:24.083 --> 21:33.626
(alarm continues)
