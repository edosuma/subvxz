Oh, Hal,

it's beautiful!

You boys are not

01:10.153 --> 01:12.113
to sit on it, stand on it,

01:12.155 --> 01:14.992
jump on it, or go anywhere

01:12.155 --> 01:14.992
near it for the next year.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.326
Where's this

coming from?

HAL:

01:16.368 --> 01:17.327
Hey, Dewey,

01:17.369 --> 01:18.620
want to go

01:17.369 --> 01:18.620
with me to take

01:18.662 --> 01:20.121
the old couch

01:18.662 --> 01:20.121
to the dump?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.373
No, I want to

01:20.163 --> 01:21.373
watch cartoons.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.917
What, are you kidding?

01:22.958 --> 01:25.126
We're talking

01:22.958 --> 01:25.126
about the city dump.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.170
Mountains of

01:25.168 --> 01:27.170
smoldering garbage

01:27.212 --> 01:29.130
as far as you can see.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.593
Swarms of flies

01:29.172 --> 01:32.593
that block out the sun.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.844
Really?

01:33.886 --> 01:34.803
Mmm.

01:34.845 --> 01:35.846
Last time

01:34.845 --> 01:35.846
I was there,

01:35.888 --> 01:37.347
I saw a 40-pound

01:35.888 --> 01:37.347
seagull carry off

01:37.389 --> 01:39.140
a dog in its beak.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.308
Wow.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.643
Wow.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.895
Come on!

01:44.187 --> 01:45.940
Hey, guys.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.649
Sorry I'm late.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.735
Stevie and I finished

01:47.691 --> 01:49.735
our geometry unit.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.986
We're two

01:49.777 --> 01:50.986
weeks ahead.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.320
Congratulations,

01:51.028 --> 01:52.320
you're grounded.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.196
What?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
You're an hour

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
and a half late.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.158
You promised you'd be back at

01:54.865 --> 01:57.158
3:00 to help with the couch.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.327
Your father and Reese

01:57.200 --> 01:59.327
nearly killed themselves.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
Yeah, but...

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
No buts!

02:01.204 --> 02:02.414
You're grounded.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.666
Two weeks in your room,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.666
no TV, no friends, no phone.

02:04.708 --> 02:05.876
But I was doing

02:04.708 --> 02:05.876
homework.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.086
I thought it'd be okay.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.004
You're not allowed

02:07.127 --> 02:09.004
to decide what's okay.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.005
Not yet.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.799
You looked me in the eye

02:10.047 --> 02:11.799
and you promised.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.883
You're grounded.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.553
This is totally unfair!

02:16.595 --> 02:17.554

We didn't even

02:53.256 --> 02:57.011
get to see it land.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.929
Well, son,

02:58.971 --> 03:00.555
I guess our work

02:58.971 --> 03:00.555
here is done.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.687
You are so dead.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.230
Francis, you know

03:06.728 --> 03:09.230
I couldn't go out

03:06.728 --> 03:09.230
with Laura unless

03:09.272 --> 03:10.398
I found somebody

03:09.272 --> 03:10.398
for her sister.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.818
Now, you're here

03:10.440 --> 03:12.818
so just try to

03:10.440 --> 03:12.818
enjoy your date.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.235
She's 12.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.696
Hey, you guys

03:14.277 --> 03:15.696
want tattoos?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.656
So she's not

03:15.737 --> 03:17.656
the one.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.074
You can still

03:17.698 --> 03:19.074
have a good time.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.617
How could you

03:19.116 --> 03:20.617
do this to me?

03:20.659 --> 03:21.535
Come on.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.244
You've done way

03:21.576 --> 03:23.244
worse to me.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.245
You totally

03:23.286 --> 03:24.245
deserve this.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.247
Based on what?

03:26.289 --> 03:29.543
Will you Jethros

03:26.289 --> 03:29.543
just shut up!?

03:29.584 --> 03:33.672
Nobody cares how many

03:29.584 --> 03:33.672
bales of hay you can lift!

03:33.714 --> 03:38.218
So, now we know--

03:33.714 --> 03:38.218
pigs can swim,

03:33.714 --> 03:38.218
cows can't.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.681
This is ridiculous.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.726
When did the word

03:42.723 --> 03:45.726
"Fascist" become

03:42.723 --> 03:45.726
such a hot button?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.062
I have been nothing

03:45.767 --> 03:48.062
but a good friend to you.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.981
Look, Francis, I'm

03:48.103 --> 03:50.981
not going to argue.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.941
You'll do this or

03:51.023 --> 03:52.941
I'll punch your face

03:52.983 --> 03:54.359
through the back

03:52.983 --> 03:54.359
of your head.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.319
See, every time

03:54.401 --> 03:56.319
I trump you with logic,

03:56.361 --> 03:57.905
you resort to violence.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.573
I just want that

03:57.946 --> 03:59.573
on the record.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.911
(loudly):

04:02.034 --> 04:03.911
Mmm, ice cream.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.872
What a wonderful,

04:03.952 --> 04:06.872
unexpected treat

04:03.952 --> 04:06.872
for some of us.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.916
MALCOLM:

04:06.914 --> 04:08.916
Yes, Reese, you get

04:06.914 --> 04:08.916
to eat ice cream

04:08.957 --> 04:10.125
and I don't.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.086
Thank you for

04:10.167 --> 04:12.086
subtly illustrating

04:10.167 --> 04:12.086
that point.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.795
(doorbell rings)

04:12.127 --> 04:13.795
I'll get it.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.297
Mmm, sprinkles.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
Aren't those

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
your favorite, Malcolm?

04:18.258 --> 04:22.179
MALCOLM:

04:18.258 --> 04:22.179
I'm rubbing my butt

04:18.258 --> 04:22.179
on your pillowcase.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.306
Oh, boy, Reese,

04:24.014 --> 04:25.306
what'd you do?!

04:25.348 --> 04:26.307
Sir, we have

04:25.348 --> 04:26.307
to evacuate

04:26.349 --> 04:27.350
the entire neighborhood.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
I need you to leave

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
your house immediately.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.312
What... evacuating?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.312
Why?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.107
There's been a toxic

04:31.354 --> 04:33.107
chemical spill

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
about a mile away--

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
a train derailed.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.026
How'd that happen?

04:36.068 --> 04:38.528
Some idiot left a couch

04:36.068 --> 04:38.528
on the railroad tracks.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.529
I wonder if

04:38.570 --> 04:39.529
that was...

04:39.571 --> 04:40.781
Careful, son.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.575
Don't want to drip.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.412
ANNOUNCER (over microphone):

04:43.617 --> 04:47.412
I repeat, if you're not in need

04:47.454 --> 04:50.415
of immediate first aid,

04:47.454 --> 04:50.415
find an available cot,

04:50.457 --> 04:54.044
remain calm and wait

04:50.457 --> 04:54.044
for further instructions.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.378
Will you look

04:54.086 --> 04:55.378
at this?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.755
I hope they find

04:55.420 --> 04:56.755
whoever's responsible

04:56.797 --> 04:59.674
and string him up

04:56.797 --> 04:59.674
by his thumbs.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.510
Hey, uh, fella,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.510
don't you think

05:02.552 --> 05:03.720
you're overreacting?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.055
I mean, my family

05:05.097 --> 05:06.848
is exposed to dangerous

05:05.097 --> 05:06.848
chemicals all the time.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.349
In-in fact, I-I remember

05:08.391 --> 05:10.811
I accidentally

05:08.391 --> 05:10.811
set off a flea bomb

05:08.391 --> 05:10.811
in the boys' room

05:10.852 --> 05:13.063
when my son, Dewey, was

05:10.852 --> 05:13.063
in there taking a nap.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.773
I can smell colors.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.566
Sir, I've got two

05:14.815 --> 05:16.566
overturned tankers

05:16.608 --> 05:17.567
out there spewing out

05:17.609 --> 05:19.987
a cloud of sulfuric acid

05:17.609 --> 05:19.987
and sodium hydroxide.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.362
That can scar your

05:20.028 --> 05:21.362
throat and lungs

05:21.404 --> 05:22.781
in a matter of seconds.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.449
But it's not

05:22.823 --> 05:24.449
necessarily fatal.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.618
I-I mean, maybe you'd need

05:24.491 --> 05:26.618
an artificial larynx,

05:26.660 --> 05:27.953
but you'd still

05:26.660 --> 05:27.953
be alive.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.163
That'd be so cool.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.081
(in a gravelly voice):

05:29.204 --> 05:31.081
My name is Reese.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.082
What are you looking at?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.374
Son, please.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.459
Has anyone died yet?

05:34.501 --> 05:35.794
Not that I'm aware of.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.254
Well, what if

05:35.836 --> 05:37.254
the wind shifts?

05:37.296 --> 05:38.672
Is the water

05:37.296 --> 05:38.672
supply going to

05:37.296 --> 05:38.672
be contaminated?

05:38.713 --> 05:39.881
What about the food?

05:39.923 --> 05:41.549
What about the

05:39.923 --> 05:41.549
medical personnel?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.384
How can be sure that all these

05:41.591 --> 05:43.384
people are going to be safe?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
I'm sorry, I really

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
don't know all of the answers.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.640
I'm just

05:45.470 --> 05:48.640
a high school senior.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.061
(moaning)

05:57.482 --> 05:59.400
Are we going to order

05:57.482 --> 05:59.400
at some point tonight?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.568
Hang on, this is

05:59.442 --> 06:00.568
important.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.196
This is the only

06:00.610 --> 06:02.196
booth she hasn't

06:02.237 --> 06:03.030
been felt up in.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.700
Have another doughnut,

06:03.071 --> 06:06.700
lonely girl.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.413
So, you like school?

06:12.455 --> 06:14.373
You're blocking

06:12.455 --> 06:14.373
my light!

06:23.466 --> 06:24.634
Check it out.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.636
Some idiot left

06:24.676 --> 06:26.636
the storage

06:24.676 --> 06:26.636
closet unlocked.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.805
I've got every

06:26.678 --> 06:28.805
Dixie Cup

06:26.678 --> 06:28.805
in the place.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.515
What are you

06:28.847 --> 06:30.515
doing with those?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.227
Building a future,

06:30.557 --> 06:33.227
my friend.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.353
I can't believe

06:33.268 --> 06:34.353
this place.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.436
This cot smells

06:34.393 --> 06:35.436
like feet.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.646
All right, we're just

06:36.688 --> 06:38.273
going to have to make

06:36.688 --> 06:38.273
the best of things.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.025
Where do you think

06:38.315 --> 06:40.025
you're going?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.442
I'm just going

06:40.067 --> 06:41.442
to look around.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.444
You are not going anywhere.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.863
You're still grounded.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.863
What? Here?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.949
That's right.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.949
Look around--

06:44.905 --> 06:47.949
we're living in a gym!

06:47.991 --> 06:49.617
That doesn't change

06:47.991 --> 06:49.617
what you did.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.370
Mom, we can all die.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.454
If that happens,

06:51.410 --> 06:53.454
you're off the hook.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.124
Until then, I want

06:53.496 --> 06:56.124
those buns on that cot.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.128
Now.

07:14.101 --> 07:14.976
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.519
Listen, I-I was

07:15.018 --> 07:16.519
just wondering if

07:16.561 --> 07:18.563
there was something

07:16.561 --> 07:18.563
that I could do to help.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.648
Not that there's any

07:18.605 --> 07:20.648
real reason, of course.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.901
I'm just... looking

07:20.690 --> 07:22.901
to do my part.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.485
I think we got it

07:22.943 --> 07:24.485
pretty well covered, sir.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.487
No, no, there

07:24.527 --> 07:26.487
must be something.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.407
I don't care if

07:26.529 --> 07:28.407
it's, if it's

07:26.529 --> 07:28.407
messy or trivial

07:28.448 --> 07:29.490
or even

07:28.448 --> 07:29.490
life-threatening...

07:29.532 --> 07:30.491
Sir, I'd appreciate it

07:30.533 --> 07:31.952
if you'd just return

07:30.533 --> 07:31.952
to your area.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.328
Please, you

07:31.993 --> 07:33.328
have to find

07:33.370 --> 07:35.122
some way for me

07:33.370 --> 07:35.122
to be useful.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.498
I have got to ease

07:35.163 --> 07:37.498
these people's

07:35.163 --> 07:37.498
suffering.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.461
They have got to know

07:37.540 --> 07:41.461
that I am here for them.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.506
Is that pepper spray?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.217
(shrilly):

07:45.548 --> 07:47.217
I also have a whistle

07:47.259 --> 07:50.137
and I'm prepared

07:47.259 --> 07:50.137
to use that as well.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.392
You know, I'd be happy

07:53.640 --> 07:55.392
to give you some

07:55.434 --> 07:56.935
but you should

07:55.434 --> 07:56.935
ask your parents first.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.519
I can't.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.813
They're dead.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.106
What?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.607
They were killed

08:01.148 --> 08:02.607
by the cloud.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.109
Can I have some?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.819
Oh, my God,

08:04.151 --> 08:05.819
you poor thing.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.612
They were choking.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.780
It was awful.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.531
Can I have

08:08.822 --> 08:10.531
the one with nuts?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.451
Oh, of course, dear.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.414
REPORTER (on TV):

08:14.244 --> 08:17.414
Toxic chemical spill has

08:14.244 --> 08:17.414
been reported in the area...

08:17.456 --> 08:18.623
Where'd they go?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.541
Don't worry, they'll

08:18.665 --> 08:20.541
be back in a few hours.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.043
They took the car?!

08:22.085 --> 08:23.795
Hey, you're the one

08:22.085 --> 08:23.795
who went to the bathroom.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.963
You gave them the opening.

08:25.005 --> 08:25.964
All right, that's it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.007
Come on, get your books.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.342
We're getting out of here.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.550
No, I want to eat.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.969
No, we're going.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
(shouting):

08:31.011 --> 08:32.971
I'm not leaving till I eat!

08:34.473 --> 08:36.557
Would you keep it down, please?

08:36.599 --> 08:39.644
You were a lot nicer when

08:36.599 --> 08:39.644
we were on the Internet.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.856
Look, you can't pull

08:41.021 --> 08:42.856
this crap with me.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.565
I have three

08:42.897 --> 08:44.565
little brothers.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
I know every

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
manipulation in the book.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.777
So get your butt

08:46.609 --> 08:47.777
in gear.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.821
No, if I go home now,

08:47.819 --> 08:49.821
Laura'll get busted.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.572
We're supposed

08:49.863 --> 08:51.572
to be at the mall.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.573
What do you care?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.950
Let me tell you

08:52.615 --> 08:53.950
about your sister.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.452
She doesn't

08:53.992 --> 08:55.452
like you at all.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.828
She treats you

08:55.494 --> 08:56.828
like dirt.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.041
(muffled whimpering)

09:01.082 --> 09:03.584
Well... she does.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.045
(muffled whimpering)

09:05.086 --> 09:06.296
It's not your fault.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.173
I mean, you don't

09:06.338 --> 09:08.173
deserve that.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.590
No one deserves that.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.468
She's the one

09:09.632 --> 09:11.468
with the problem.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.594
Really, I'm sure

09:11.510 --> 09:13.594
you have a lot

09:11.510 --> 09:13.594
of nice qualities

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
that people don't

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
even...

09:14.721 --> 09:17.057
Waitress! Can we get

09:14.721 --> 09:17.057
some service over here?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.058
Yes?

09:18.099 --> 09:20.060
(whimpering):

09:18.099 --> 09:20.060
I want the burger plate,

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
extra fries and

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
a chocolate malt.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.691
DEWEY:

09:24.689 --> 09:26.691
...and then they were

09:24.689 --> 09:26.691
trapped in the car

09:26.733 --> 09:28.109
and they told me

09:26.733 --> 09:28.109
to get help and I ran

09:28.151 --> 09:29.528
and I ran,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.197
then I fell down

09:29.569 --> 09:32.197
and when I woke up,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.615
the ambulance man

09:32.239 --> 09:34.615
was holding me.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.285
And your parents were...

09:38.703 --> 09:41.622
Ooh, you poor

09:38.703 --> 09:41.622
little boy.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.624
That looks like fun.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.544
What is wrong with you?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.712
Give that to him!

09:47.754 --> 09:48.796
What can I say?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
We're all trying to get

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
through as best we can.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.217
Thank you.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.635
And of course,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.635
in these disasters,

09:54.677 --> 09:57.680
it's always the children

09:54.677 --> 09:57.680
who suffer the most.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.140
LOIS:

09:57.722 --> 09:59.140
No, no, no!

09:59.182 --> 10:01.851
You're not talking to him.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.851
He's grounded.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.527
REESE:

10:07.690 --> 10:10.527
Looks like you need

10:07.690 --> 10:10.527
a cup, friend.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.946
Ah, that'd be

10:10.569 --> 10:12.946
great, thanks.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.655
I wish it were that simple.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.366
What are you talking about?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.366
I'm thirsty.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.952
Is that  your  truck out there

10:16.408 --> 10:18.952
with the canned fruit?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.371
Yeah, why?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.623
Let's take a walk.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.585
There!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.462
That should take care

10:26.626 --> 10:28.462
of that wobble, huh?

10:28.503 --> 10:29.670
Listen, is it too drafty here?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.590
Should we move you away

10:29.712 --> 10:31.590
from the window?

10:31.631 --> 10:32.757
No, no, we're fine.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.301
Thanks for the help.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.677
Well, that's what this

10:34.342 --> 10:36.677
is all about, huh?

10:36.719 --> 10:37.971
Helping each other out.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.599
This is the kind of thing

10:38.012 --> 10:40.599
that we should be focusing on.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.849
Not a witch hunt,

10:41.891 --> 10:44.894
pointing fingers...

10:41.891 --> 10:44.894
blame, blame!

10:44.936 --> 10:46.687
We are bigger than that,

10:46.729 --> 10:48.856
aren't we, honey?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.484
Who wants

10:48.898 --> 10:50.484
a bedtime story?

10:50.525 --> 10:52.486
Can't you make him

10:50.525 --> 10:52.486
go away, Daddy?

10:52.527 --> 10:53.528
(laughs)

10:53.570 --> 10:56.615
She is precious.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.617
Okay.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.412
Excuse me, did you

11:00.118 --> 11:02.412
find the boy whose

11:00.118 --> 11:02.412
parents were killed?

11:02.454 --> 11:03.704
Not yet.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.747
Excuse me.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
Did you say,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
"killed"?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.376
Yes, they were killed

11:06.124 --> 11:08.376
by the gas cloud.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.211
Oh, my God.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.381
The boy's mother saved him

11:10.253 --> 11:13.381
with her very last breath.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.343
And then the poor boy had to

11:13.423 --> 11:16.343
strangle his own dog

11:16.384 --> 11:17.885
just to stop

11:16.384 --> 11:17.885
its suffering.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.473
And on his birthday!

11:25.644 --> 11:26.978
(cries)

11:27.020 --> 11:28.355
Yes?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.731
I want a piece of

11:28.396 --> 11:30.731
apple pie a la mode,

11:30.773 --> 11:33.151
some chocolate cake

11:30.773 --> 11:33.151
and a banana split.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.362
Sure thing.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.362
Why don't you save

11:33.193 --> 11:35.362
me some money

11:35.403 --> 11:36.737
and just yell

11:35.403 --> 11:36.737
at your sister

11:36.779 --> 11:39.240
instead of burying your anger

11:36.779 --> 11:39.240
in a mountain of French fries?

11:39.282 --> 11:40.617
Are you calling me fat?

11:40.659 --> 11:42.743
What? No, I'm not

11:40.659 --> 11:42.743
calling you fat.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.828
So now I'm a liar?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.955
No, you're twisting around

11:43.870 --> 11:45.955
everything I say.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.832
Why do you do that?

11:47.874 --> 11:49.209
You hurt my feelings.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.170
Okay, would you just

11:49.250 --> 11:52.170
keep it down, please?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.463
I'm sorry.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.048
Why do you touch

11:53.505 --> 11:55.048
your hair so much?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.757
I don't touch

11:55.089 --> 11:56.757
my hair that much.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.926
Why is everyone

11:56.799 --> 11:58.926
so fixated on my hair?

11:58.968 --> 11:59.927
I'm sick of it.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.971
Okay, okay, relax.

12:02.013 --> 12:05.392
I... I just...

12:02.013 --> 12:05.392
I don't want to

12:02.013 --> 12:05.392
talk about it.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.479
It's just that people

12:06.809 --> 12:09.479
make fun of me.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.066
The guys at school call me

12:10.605 --> 12:13.066
"Poodlehead."

12:13.107 --> 12:15.943
That is so cruel.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.656
I mean, I can see

12:15.985 --> 12:19.656
it, but still...

12:20.823 --> 12:23.034
REESE:

12:20.823 --> 12:23.034
I got to tell

12:20.823 --> 12:23.034
you, Malcolm,

12:23.076 --> 12:24.869
sometimes, I'm so good,

12:23.076 --> 12:24.869
it's scary.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.787
What are you doing

12:24.911 --> 12:26.787
with toilet paper?

12:26.829 --> 12:28.498
I got my hands

12:26.829 --> 12:28.498
on some canned fruit.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.000
I traded those for batteries,

12:28.540 --> 12:31.000
the batteries for DVDs.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.793
And I swapped those

12:31.042 --> 12:32.793
with the janitor

12:32.835 --> 12:35.963
for the school's entire supply

12:32.835 --> 12:35.963
of toilet paper.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.632
Once the specially "seasoned"

12:37.674 --> 12:38.799
meat loaf works its magic,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
I can name my price.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.304
You know, that's not

12:40.843 --> 12:43.304
only unbelievably evil

12:43.346 --> 12:46.307
but you actually put some

12:43.346 --> 12:46.307
thought and effort into it.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.808
I'm impressed.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.809
I don't know what it is.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.729
I guess when people are

12:48.851 --> 12:50.729
miserable and suffering,

12:50.769 --> 12:51.812
it brings out the best in me.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.897
Thanks for noticing.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.023
Hi, guys.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.816
Hey, Dabney, did you bring

12:54.065 --> 12:55.816
your Palm Pilot?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.652
Yeah.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.652
Good to know.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.739
Hey, Malcolm,

12:57.694 --> 13:00.739
isn't this great?

13:00.779 --> 13:01.822
I wouldn't know.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.866
Come on, we get to

13:01.864 --> 13:03.866
hang out in the gym...

13:03.908 --> 13:06.827
without worrying

13:03.908 --> 13:06.827
about dodgeballs,

13:03.908 --> 13:06.827
or getting pantsed.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.288
LLOYD:

13:06.869 --> 13:08.288
It's a dream come true.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.082
We actually get to live

13:08.329 --> 13:11.082
in the school.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.834
Check this out!

13:13.876 --> 13:16.630
It's the key to the

13:13.876 --> 13:16.630
girls' locker room.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.757
We were actually standing

13:18.797 --> 13:21.635
where girls take

13:18.797 --> 13:21.635
showers... naked.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.469
Or so I'm told.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.637
LOIS:

13:22.510 --> 13:23.637
Malcolm.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.638
No visitors.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.846
Malcolm's grounded.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.890
You shouldn't be talking to him.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.059
Everyone, this is my son.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.852
He's being punished.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.730
No one should talk to him.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.523
Mom, for God's sakes,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.523
they just came over

13:35.565 --> 13:36.524
to say hi.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.859
I took the key to the

13:36.566 --> 13:38.859
girls' locker room.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.779
Please, don't tell

13:38.901 --> 13:40.779
our mothers.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.363
I'm so ashamed.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.123
What?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.958
You did that just

13:52.165 --> 13:53.958
to humiliate me.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.585
Is that what you think?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.585
Yes.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.462
It was completely

13:55.627 --> 13:57.462
unjustified.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.173
And I want you to know,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.173
I am never going to forget this.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.257
Well, good.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.092
It'll be the first time

14:01.299 --> 14:03.092
in ten years

14:03.134 --> 14:04.927
the punishment's actually stuck.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.605
People, please,

14:13.812 --> 14:15.605
the money we raise

14:15.647 --> 14:18.191
cannot bring back his parents

14:15.647 --> 14:18.191
but we must do something.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.776
We're his only family now.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.362
Hasn't that poor,

14:19.818 --> 14:22.362
little boy suffered enough

14:22.403 --> 14:23.822
from the train wreck?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.907
Which, by the way is

14:23.863 --> 14:26.907
a surprisingly common occurrence

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
when looked at

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
in a nationwide context.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.788
Please, we've got to give

14:28.993 --> 14:31.788
till it hurts.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.916
I'm just saying, it might

14:33.873 --> 14:35.916
be hard to get my hands

14:35.958 --> 14:37.377
on five blankets.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.295
Look, I need them.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.295
My family's freezing.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.921
A lot of people are cold.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.132
It's a real problem.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.132
How about the watch?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.510
The guy before me

14:43.174 --> 14:45.510
only had to give

14:43.174 --> 14:45.510
you his socks.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.638
It's a cold world.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.638
It's getting colder

14:45.552 --> 14:48.638
by the minute.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.851
You're an evil,

14:48.680 --> 14:52.851
little punk.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.227
Uh-uh.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.978
Socks, too.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.940
And then Dave told me

14:58.022 --> 14:59.940
they were just studying.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.735
But they were totally

14:59.982 --> 15:01.735
having a pizza party.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.652
You're kidding?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.612
They came to my room

15:02.694 --> 15:04.612
and asked for napkins.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.947
It's not like I could

15:04.654 --> 15:06.947
tell them how hurt I

15:04.654 --> 15:06.947
was, 'cause you

15:06.989 --> 15:09.325
constantly got to

15:06.989 --> 15:09.325
keep up this front

15:06.989 --> 15:09.325
of being the tough guy.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.951
They have no idea

15:09.367 --> 15:10.951
who I really am.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.871
If they knew

15:10.993 --> 15:12.871
I kept a dream journal...

15:12.912 --> 15:13.954
You do?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.248
I think that's so cool.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.625
Really?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.960
I do, too.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.588
I'll tell you one thing,

15:20.002 --> 15:21.588
if those guys ever

15:21.629 --> 15:23.964
got a hold of that,

15:21.629 --> 15:23.964
I'd never hear

15:21.629 --> 15:23.964
the end of it.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.384
So? You don't have to

15:24.006 --> 15:26.384
care what they think.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.968
I don't.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.968
Well, what about

15:26.426 --> 15:27.968
your sister?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.221
She's an idiot.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.972
Hey, good for you.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.974
Anyway, people around here

15:32.014 --> 15:33.974
are freaks.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.977
Some nights, I lock myself

15:34.016 --> 15:36.977
in my room and spin my globe.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.229
And wherever I point my finger,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.398
I just pretend

15:38.271 --> 15:40.398
that's where I really live.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.024
I do that, too.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.024
Really?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.569
REESE:

15:42.066 --> 15:44.569
And you'll feel the

15:42.066 --> 15:44.569
cold worse than anyone.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.986
Because, let's face it,

15:46.028 --> 15:48.740
your circulation

15:46.028 --> 15:48.740
isn't that good to begin with.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.286
I already gave

15:51.951 --> 15:53.286
you money.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.205
And you're satisfied.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.205
I see.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.626
That little boy doesn't need

15:56.247 --> 15:59.626
clothes or an education.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.586
Let's just put him

15:59.667 --> 16:01.586
to work in the mines

16:01.628 --> 16:03.087
like they did

16:01.628 --> 16:03.087
when you were a girl.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.881
I'm on a fixed income.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.633
So, what are you

16:04.923 --> 16:06.633
trying to do?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.509
Take it to the grave

16:06.674 --> 16:08.509
with you?

16:08.551 --> 16:11.220
Should we get you

16:08.551 --> 16:11.220
a casket with saddlebags?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.389
Give me my shoe.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.433
It's right here.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.433
Come and get it.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.851
What's the matter?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.853
Was somebody

16:16.893 --> 16:18.853
a bad boy?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.020
(giggling)

16:20.062 --> 16:21.021
Does the bad boy want

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
his shoe back?

16:23.065 --> 16:25.025
LOIS:

16:23.065 --> 16:25.025
Malcolm!

16:25.067 --> 16:26.193
Get back on the cot.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.654
This kid's got my shoe.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.822
Get back on the cot.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.030
I'll take care of this.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.073
Is Mommy going to

16:31.115 --> 16:34.034
take care of it

16:31.115 --> 16:34.034
for you?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.745
(giggling)

16:35.787 --> 16:39.039
Malcolm, get back

16:35.787 --> 16:39.039
on that cot.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.877
No.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.754
Excuse me?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.547
I've had it. I quit.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.674
What do you

16:46.589 --> 16:47.674
mean, you quit?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.049
I quit this stupid system.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.260
The only reason I'm being

16:49.091 --> 16:51.260
punished like this

16:51.302 --> 16:53.847
is because I agreed

16:51.302 --> 16:53.847
to be punished like this.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.055
And I'm not going to

16:55.097 --> 16:56.265
agree anymore.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.559
This isn't parenting.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.559
This is just sadism.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.061
Oh, you think

16:58.601 --> 17:01.061
I enjoy this?

16:58.601 --> 17:01.061
Yes, I do.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.480
And I am way too old

17:01.103 --> 17:02.480
for this.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.231
We are going to find

17:02.522 --> 17:04.231
some other way

17:04.273 --> 17:05.692
of dealing

17:04.273 --> 17:05.692
with each other.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.443
We are going to change

17:05.733 --> 17:07.443
the rules.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.069
What were you

17:07.485 --> 17:09.069
planning to do?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.071
Take away my TV

17:09.111 --> 17:11.071
when I'm married?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.574
Give me a time-out

17:11.113 --> 17:13.574
when I'm 30?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.620
What?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.620
Am I supposed to be scared?

17:18.913 --> 17:20.331
What are you going

17:18.913 --> 17:20.331
to do, spank me?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.625
Okay.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.880
Mom, what are you doing?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.756
Mom, cut it out.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.257
I don't know what you

17:28.798 --> 17:30.257
think you're doing.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.176
How did she get so strong?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.057
(gasping)

17:43.604 --> 17:47.066
When I can't do this,

17:43.604 --> 17:47.066
we'll change the rules.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.112
Five hundred

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
and sixty-three dollars?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.116
Come on, people.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.913
What if he needs braces?

17:56.158 --> 17:59.913
What if he has scoliosis?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.789
Huh?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.791
Okay, fine.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.961
I'll just say,

18:03.833 --> 18:06.961
"Sorry, little crooked boy.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.589
"You can always get

18:07.003 --> 18:09.589
a job in the circus...

18:09.630 --> 18:11.925
"while the rest of us drive

18:09.630 --> 18:11.925
our Porsches

18:11.966 --> 18:13.133
and eat our T-bone steaks."

18:13.175 --> 18:16.345
Dad, can we go

18:13.175 --> 18:16.345
home now?

18:16.387 --> 18:18.639
My stomach hurts.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.639
Not now, son.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.140
That your kid?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.183
Yes, why?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.560
This guy has been

18:22.602 --> 18:24.311
collecting money

18:22.602 --> 18:24.311
for his own kid.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.521
What?

18:25.563 --> 18:27.857
Dewey, did you tell

18:25.563 --> 18:27.857
these people...?

18:27.899 --> 18:29.609
What the hell

18:27.899 --> 18:29.609
you trying to

18:27.899 --> 18:29.609
pull here, mister?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.236
He's been yanking our chain!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.154
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait,

18:32.278 --> 18:34.154
wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.782
I swear, I didn't know

18:34.196 --> 18:35.782
anything about this.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.158
And if he lied to you,

18:35.823 --> 18:38.158
well, I can assure you

18:38.200 --> 18:41.161
that is not the kind of behavior

18:38.200 --> 18:41.161
I allow in my family.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.162
REESE:

18:41.203 --> 18:42.162
Ow, ow, ow...

18:42.204 --> 18:43.247
Is this your son?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.331
Reese?

18:44.373 --> 18:45.959
He was running

18:44.373 --> 18:45.959
a black market.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.795
He had two diabetics

18:46.000 --> 18:48.795
bidding against each

18:46.000 --> 18:48.795
other for insulin.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.254
That is a lie.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.175
Now, now, now, wait

18:52.840 --> 18:55.175
just a second.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.176
I know how this must look.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.845
But if you just give me

18:56.218 --> 18:57.845
the chance

18:57.887 --> 18:59.179
to get to the bottom of this,

18:59.221 --> 19:00.974
I swear to you,

18:59.221 --> 19:00.974
I will make this right.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.100
Come over here.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.184
You boys have both behaved

19:02.141 --> 19:04.184
very badly.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.353
So, you are both going

19:04.226 --> 19:06.353
to apologize

19:06.395 --> 19:08.230
to these nice, generous people

19:08.272 --> 19:10.566
like you have never

19:08.272 --> 19:10.566
apologized before.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.192
Do you hear me?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
Okay.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
Dewey, come on.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.197
Go ahead.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.491
Nice and loud.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285
We're sorry we left

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285
the couch on the tracks

19:21.327 --> 19:23.203
and wrecked the train.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.914
(gasping)

19:30.169 --> 19:32.212
Reese, run, run.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.214
JERRY:

19:32.254 --> 19:34.214
Hey, stop him.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
(Hal yelling)

19:39.137 --> 19:42.306
Well, this is it.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.224
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.643
Whatever.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.231
Hey, I, uh...

19:51.273 --> 19:53.151
I actually had

19:51.273 --> 19:53.151
a good time.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.234
Me, too.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.737
You're, like,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.737
a really good

19:54.276 --> 19:56.737
girlfriend.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.197
Thanks.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.411
Hey, sorry about tonight.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.832
Yeah, well, your plan

20:04.453 --> 20:07.832
to palm me off on a 12-

20:04.453 --> 20:07.832
year-old backfired,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.959
'cause I actually had

20:07.874 --> 20:09.959
a really good time.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.460
Well, good for you,

20:10.001 --> 20:11.460
Poodlehead.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.753
You know what?

20:12.795 --> 20:15.255
I don't care about your

20:12.795 --> 20:15.255
childish taunts anymore.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.257
You can call me

20:15.297 --> 20:17.257
anything you like.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
I think I'll stick

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
with Poodlehead.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.261
Fine.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.140
I'm glad it doesn't bother you

20:21.303 --> 20:24.140
when I call you "Poodlehead,"

20:24.182 --> 20:25.766
Poodlehead.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.351
I got to tell you,

20:25.808 --> 20:27.351
Poodlehead...

20:27.393 --> 20:28.936
Shut up!

20:28.978 --> 20:32.314
Do not set foot

20:28.978 --> 20:32.314
outside this area.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.274
Not one foot.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.985
I would just like

20:34.316 --> 20:35.985
to get one thing clear.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.362
When we go home,

20:36.027 --> 20:38.362
you fellas are still going to be

20:38.404 --> 20:40.280
a presence

20:38.404 --> 20:40.280
in the community, right?

20:40.322 --> 20:44.994
If I wasn't in uniform,

20:40.322 --> 20:44.994
I'd take a swing at you, myself.

20:45.036 --> 20:45.953
Fair enough.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.663
LOIS:

20:45.995 --> 20:47.663
Are you telling me

20:47.705 --> 20:50.290
that I can't discipline

20:47.705 --> 20:50.290
my own child?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.126
Lady, we got a lot

20:50.332 --> 20:52.126
of angry people in there.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.213
I think it's best you

20:52.168 --> 20:55.213
stay out here with the

20:52.168 --> 20:55.213
other troublemakers.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.384
They'd like us to

20:56.756 --> 21:00.384
stay inside the box.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.477
This is outrageous.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.312
We're going to freeze

21:10.519 --> 21:12.312
to death out here.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.564
What did  we  do?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
Maybe Malcolm can bring us

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
a couple blankets.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.984
Come on.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.319
Malcolm.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.363
Can you get us some blankets?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.032
LOIS:

21:21.405 --> 21:23.032
Help us out here.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.243
REESE:

21:23.074 --> 21:25.243
It's cold out here.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.828
I'm sorry, I'm not supposed

21:25.284 --> 21:27.828
to leave my cot.

21:27.870 --> 21:31.582
LOIS:

21:27.870 --> 21:31.582
Don't think you won't suffer the

21:27.870 --> 21:31.582
consequences later, mister.
