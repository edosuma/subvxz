01:27.545 --> 01:31.382
"Where tracks and golf balls roll
and wind.

01:34.176 --> 01:37.597
"Round colored banners of all kind.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.102
"Here, new instructions you will find."

01:43.269 --> 01:46.105
<i>You've</i> come
<i>to the right place, Mr. McWhirter.</i>

01:46.188 --> 01:48.608
<i>You won't be able to find me.</i>

01:48.691 --> 01:51.360
Just follow the sound of my voice.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.907
Who the devil are you?

01:57.617 --> 02:02.788
Well, for a diplomatic courier,
you're not very diplomatic, are you?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.958
If you're my contact,
what's the countersign?

02:06.125 --> 02:08.711
Patience, patience.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.963
<i>All your questions will be answered,
dear boy,</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:14.258
<i>if you'll simply follow
the running lights.</i>

02:24.769 --> 02:27.772
Okay, I'm here. Now what?

02:37.698 --> 02:40.326
<i>Now then, about that
collection of bearer bonds</i>

02:40.409 --> 02:42.161
<i>you're supposed to transport,</i>

02:42.411 --> 02:44.497
if you'll just tell me
where I can find them,

02:45.706 --> 02:47.541
<i>you might get out of here alive.</i>

02:57.677 --> 03:00.471
All right! All right, I'll tell you!

03:00.888 --> 03:03.474
<i>Good call. Now, hurry up.</i>

03:04.016 --> 03:07.770
I hate it when people talk
with their mouth full.

03:15.194 --> 03:18.906
All we know is this, last night,
the International Relief Consortium

03:18.989 --> 03:21.826
was supposed to receive a delivery
from one of their couriers.

03:21.909 --> 03:25.079
This guy. Name's McWhirter.

03:27.331 --> 03:28.541
He's lucky to be alive.

03:28.749 --> 03:31.460
He was supposed to pick up
and deliver a donation.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.089
A diplomatic pouch containing
$750,000 in bearer bonds

03:35.172 --> 03:37.258
earmarked for humanitarian aid-

03:37.425 --> 03:40.678
To starving refugees in Eastern Europe.
Yeah, I know.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.597
Only McWhirter never showed up.

03:43.764 --> 03:46.517
Somebody else got to the bonds
before he did.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.977
And now they're missing.

03:48.144 --> 03:52.022
The same somebody who lured him into
that quicksand trap you mentioned?

03:52.189 --> 03:55.568
You know who that sounds like,
don't you? Wormwood.

03:55.651 --> 03:56.861
The Interrogator.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.113
The guy who specializes in
using deathtraps

03:59.196 --> 04:01.532
to pry information out of his victims?

04:01.699 --> 04:04.910
Terrific. Look up "slippery"
in the dictionary,

04:04.994 --> 04:06.787
and you get Josiah Wormwood.

04:07.204 --> 04:09.498
Well, I guess if anyone can
pin something on him

04:09.582 --> 04:11.500
and make it stick, you can.

04:12.334 --> 04:15.796
Maybe. Right now, though,
we're not even sure he's in town.

04:16.672 --> 04:19.592
But I think I know which one
of Wormwood's associates

04:19.800 --> 04:21.844
might be able to give me
that information.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.559
Oh, yeah, I remember this clown.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.935
Nothing but a two-bit con man.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.521
But a continental type, a real smoothie,

04:32.646 --> 04:34.732
<i>the kind who'll do anything
for a free meal.</i>

04:35.316 --> 04:37.193
<i>Calls himself "The Baron."</i>

04:40.279 --> 04:44.241
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest speaker this evening

04:44.325 --> 04:46.869
Baron Waclaw Jozek.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.385
Madam President, honored guests,

05:03.761 --> 05:05.888
this is a rare pleasure for me.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.975
Unaccustomed as I am to being
sought after...

05:17.566 --> 05:18.567
No, no, no!

05:22.404 --> 05:25.032
No, no, no!

05:30.287 --> 05:32.957
How dare you manhandle me.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.835
I want information from you.

05:37.002 --> 05:39.880
By the way,
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.936
That's all you have on
your friend Wormwood?

05:54.103 --> 05:56.272
I've told you all I know.

05:58.774 --> 06:01.527
What more do you want?
Let me down.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.196
Just one more thing, Baron.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.366
I suggest that for your health

06:08.659 --> 06:13.706
you take a vacation,
somewhere far away from Gotham City.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.183
Come in.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.615
This had better
be important, Waclaw.

06:49.783 --> 06:51.493
It is, to me.

07:01.378 --> 07:04.632
I want the Batman's cape and cowl.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.092
And I want you to get them for me.

07:08.802 --> 07:11.764
Hmm. Humble the legendary Batman?

07:12.264 --> 07:14.808
I must admit,
it is an intriguing challenge.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.436
But I'm afraid I can't contain
my curiosity.

07:18.145 --> 07:21.023
I must know, what do you want them for?

07:23.567 --> 07:26.070
I will be glad to tell you that,
dear Wormwood,

07:26.528 --> 07:30.240
if you'll tell me how you got
those bearer bonds

07:30.324 --> 07:33.285
away from
the International Relief Consortium.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.664
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:37.581 --> 07:40.709
Have it your way.

07:40.876 --> 07:43.003
In that case, I will say

07:43.087 --> 07:47.466
only that you will be very well paid
to do as I request

07:47.967 --> 07:51.261
without further questions.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.520
All right, I'll get you
the Batman's cape and cowl.

07:59.853 --> 08:01.397
That won't be difficult.

08:01.897 --> 08:05.484
He is only human, after all.

08:28.215 --> 08:30.217
Got a new toy, I see.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.928
I figure it might come in handy.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.973
It might get you in trouble
with the mayor.

08:36.056 --> 08:37.725
Let me worry about the mayor.

08:37.891 --> 08:39.852
Here, have a look at this.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.445
"Where iron horses go to rot
and children toot their horns a lot...

08:49.611 --> 08:52.948
"A damsel's pleas shall come to naught."

08:53.323 --> 08:54.700
Do you know what it means?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.375
Don't you?

09:48.378 --> 09:50.172
Looking for someone, Batman?

09:50.589 --> 09:52.800
<i>Sorry, you won't find me in there.</i>

09:53.008 --> 09:55.469
<i>However, you will find</i>

09:55.844 --> 09:56.929
<i>a trap!</i>

10:06.522 --> 10:10.943
<i>Now then, you have approximately
one minute to save that young woman.</i>

10:21.995 --> 10:24.748
But I'll remove her from jeopardy

10:25.040 --> 10:28.877
if you simply surrender
your cape and cowl.

10:29.044 --> 10:32.422
<i>You can push it through the little
opening at the base of the engine door.</i>

10:32.881 --> 10:35.008
<i>Thirty seconds left, Batman.</i>

10:40.222 --> 10:41.723
Fifteen seconds.

10:43.058 --> 10:46.145
<i>Help! Please, help!</i>

10:56.572 --> 10:58.490
<i>One second left.</i>

11:03.120 --> 11:04.454
A hologram?

11:31.064 --> 11:32.399
<i><i>Do you have the items?</i></i>

11:32.524 --> 11:34.234
Uh, no.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.278
Uh, the first apparatus...

11:37.029 --> 11:39.239
<i>The trap at the old railway exhibit?</i>

11:39.406 --> 11:41.658
<i>Yes. He beat it.</i>

11:42.075 --> 11:44.161
So there will have to be others?

11:44.870 --> 11:49.833
Only one. And this time,
I shall put the man himself in jeopardy.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.587
I have a facility at
De Larues Wax Museum

11:53.670 --> 11:56.548
that will serve our purposes nicely.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.593
Just see that you succeed.

12:00.135 --> 12:04.431
Oh, I will. And once you have what
you Want, you must tell me why-

12:04.514 --> 12:06.058
Well!

12:10.520 --> 12:13.148
"Where Washington and young Babe Ruth

12:13.232 --> 12:15.776
"stand side by side
with John Wilkes Booth

12:16.401 --> 12:19.279
"Batman will find a plan uncouth."

12:19.446 --> 12:21.907
Well, what do you think this one means?

12:22.741 --> 12:25.744
Those famous figures standing
around together?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.080
De Larues Wax Museum, what else?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.374
Oh. Of course.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.732
<i>Over here, Batman.</i>

12:57.734 --> 13:00.404
<i>That's it. Come right in.</i>

13:09.496 --> 13:12.374
Now, if I might call your attention

13:12.457 --> 13:15.585
to the panel sliding open
along the ceiling.

13:15.752 --> 13:19.840
<i>It's uncovering
a 20,000-watt halogen bulb.</i>

13:20.799 --> 13:24.511
<i>I don't actually know how hot
20,000 watts make a room,</i>

13:25.012 --> 13:27.514
<i>but I do know that it melts wax.</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:42.070
And eventually, it will melt you.

14:05.469 --> 14:10.140
Of course, you can save yourself simply
by giving me your cape and cowl.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.311
<i>After all, it looks like your weapons
are covered with wax.</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:16.146
No hurry. I'll wait.

14:17.731 --> 14:21.151
<i>Oh, very inventive.
Do you suppose it will work?</i>

14:44.007 --> 14:48.553
<i>Congratulations. But don't breathe
too deeply, Batman.</i>

14:49.096 --> 14:51.390
<i>It seems that when you shattered
the lamp,</i>

14:51.556 --> 14:56.770
<i>you triggered the release of a toxic
nerve gas from a tank in the ceiling.</i>

14:57.020 --> 15:00.690
Now, your cape and cowl, please.

15:03.610 --> 15:07.197
All right. All right. Turn off the gas.

15:08.865 --> 15:09.866
You win.

15:24.005 --> 15:28.093
<i>Ah. Nothing like
a breath of fresh air, eh, Batman?</i>

15:31.888 --> 15:35.100
<i>And now, your cape and cowl, please.</i>

15:41.273 --> 15:42.899
Satisfied?

15:44.067 --> 15:45.527
Actually, no.

15:45.735 --> 15:50.198
I wonder if you would put those down
neatly over here, by the light.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.372
<i>A second mask?</i>

15:58.165 --> 16:02.752
<i>Not as confident as we 'd</i> seem <i>then,
are we?</i>

16:03.086 --> 16:07.757
<i>Hmm. Well, keep your silly identity.
These are all I require.</i>

16:25.859 --> 16:27.569
Stop stalling, Jozek.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.573
I've got the goods.

16:31.823 --> 16:33.867
Have you got my certified check?

16:35.118 --> 16:36.411
Ihaveindeed.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.582
Ah, but first,
let us drink to our success.

16:41.249 --> 16:43.668
On one condition.

16:44.419 --> 16:49.049
Will you tell me why you wanted
Batman's cape and cowl, finally?

16:49.674 --> 16:54.930
Ah, but you know my condition.
You must tell me your secret.

16:55.263 --> 16:57.849
Then I will tell you mine.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.355
What did you do
with those bonds?

17:08.151 --> 17:10.445
And who commissioned their theft?

17:13.782 --> 17:16.493
If you really want to know,

17:17.160 --> 17:20.956
an agent of the Quirian Emirates
will get the bonds

17:21.122 --> 17:25.085
from a locker
at Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow

17:25.168 --> 17:28.505
when I meet him there to give him
this key.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.845
Now, what will you do
with the cape and cowl?

17:42.060 --> 17:45.230
I am going to wear them.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.903
You're not Jozek?

17:55.865 --> 17:59.202
You were playing. Playing me for a fool.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.497
From the day you first walked in here.

18:08.628 --> 18:11.673
It was you I was dealing with all along!

18:12.090 --> 18:13.091
Give me the key.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.576
<i><i>If you really want to know,</i></i>

20:44.659 --> 20:47.120
<i>an agent of the Quirian Emirates...</i>

20:47.287 --> 20:50.165
The bugs in the room picked up
the whole story on tape.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.667
<i>...at Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow.</i>

20:54.961 --> 20:57.005
- Thank you, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

20:58.631 --> 21:03.386
And thank Jozek for the use of the hall,
if he ever returns from Europe.

21:06.681 --> 21:10.643
When we collared the Quirian agent
at the airport, he sang like a bird.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.772
And he fingered you as the guy
who was gonna sell him the bonds.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.691
Oh, I almost forgot.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.943
This came for you.

21:23.239 --> 21:28.411
"Confinement will speed your reform.
But long, cold nights will be the norm.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.790
"So here's a thing to keep you warm"?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.667
Well.

22:20.797 --> 22:21.798
