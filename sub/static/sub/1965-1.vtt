01:13.490 --> 01:14.573
I warned you.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.701
Did I not warn you what would come
of dealing with Dwarves?

01:17.952 --> 01:19.036
Now they've done it.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.454
They've woken the dragon!

01:20.705 --> 01:22.748
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads!

01:22.999 --> 01:24.374
Come on. Quickly.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.334
Quickly.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.585
Faster now...

01:26.628 --> 01:27.711
...I'm trying to evacuate.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.713
Careful, man.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.298
Never mind the books. Get on!

01:31.549 --> 01:33.759
But, sire, should
we not try to save the town?

01:34.010 --> 01:35.052
The town is lost.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.513
- Save the gold!
- You heard him. Get a move on.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.390
- Da!
- Come on.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.685
Pile them up!

01:56.032 --> 01:57.991
We have no time. We must leave.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.409
- Get him up.
- Come on.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.662
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm fine. I can walk.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.248
- Fast as you can.
- We're not leaving.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.624
Not without our father.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.418
If you stay here, your sisters will die.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.586
Is that what your father would want?

02:12.632 --> 02:13.382
Open...

02:13.633 --> 02:15.092
...this door!

02:15.343 --> 02:16.844
Do you hear me?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.139
I can see him!

02:20.390 --> 02:21.390
Look!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.648
Down here! Now!

02:29.899 --> 02:31.650
- Give me your hand.
- We gotta go.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.485
Quickly now. Hurry.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.279
Kili, come on!

02:35.530 --> 02:37.739
- It's around the corner!
- Keep on going, man!

02:46.666 --> 02:48.083
Dragon!

03:23.411 --> 03:24.828
Come on, come on!

03:25.413 --> 03:27.372
Faster! Faster!

03:30.585 --> 03:31.710
If only we could take...

03:31.961 --> 03:34.588
...more of these people with us,
but they're hardly...

03:34.839 --> 03:36.298
- Worth it. I quite agree.
- Help!

03:36.549 --> 03:37.549
Help!

03:43.723 --> 03:44.723
Look out!

03:51.356 --> 03:52.356
Move it!

03:52.398 --> 03:53.398
Move it!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.692
Come on! Faster!

03:55.944 --> 03:57.736
My gold! My gold!

03:57.987 --> 03:58.737
We're carrying too much.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.322
We need to dump something.

04:01.115 --> 04:01.782
Quite right...

04:02.033 --> 04:03.242
...Alfrid.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.084
Faster! Faster!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.370
Poor souls.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.931
Da.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.808
Da!

07:19.105 --> 07:20.105
He hit it!

07:20.189 --> 07:21.982
- He hit the dragon! He did!
- No.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.817
He hit his mark! I saw.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.069
His arrows cannot pierce its hide.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.572
I fear nothing will.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.003
What are you doing?

07:43.212 --> 07:44.963
- Come back! Bain!
- Bain!

07:45.214 --> 07:46.214
Bain!

07:46.424 --> 07:47.132
Get back here!

07:47.383 --> 07:49.259
- Bain!
- Leave him.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.094
We cannot go back.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.345
Bain!

08:15.244 --> 08:16.244
Dad.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.247
Bain! What are you doing?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.579
You were supposed to leave!

08:20.708 --> 08:22.209
- I came to help you.
- No!

08:22.460 --> 08:24.127
Nothing can stop it now.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.462
This might.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.175
Bain.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.510
You go back.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.929
You get out of here. Now.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.390
Dad!

08:42.980 --> 08:43.980
Bain!

08:56.702 --> 08:57.702
Stop, stop! Halt!

08:57.954 --> 08:58.954
Halt!

09:06.837 --> 09:08.380
Who are you...

09:08.631 --> 09:10.131
...that would stand...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.425
...against me?

09:15.721 --> 09:17.931
Now, that is a pity.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.811
What will you do now...

09:23.437 --> 09:25.021
...Bowman?

09:25.940 --> 09:26.940
You are...

09:27.108 --> 09:28.483
...forsaken.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.195
No help will come.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.906
Now's our chance! Go!

09:35.157 --> 09:35.865
Go!

09:36.117 --> 09:38.451
Head for the open water!

09:38.703 --> 09:39.869
Hmm.

09:42.081 --> 09:42.706
Is that...

09:42.957 --> 09:44.249
...your child?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.544
You cannot...

09:47.795 --> 09:49.963
...save him from the fire.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.715
He will...

09:51.966 --> 09:53.800
...burn!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.279
Stay still, son.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.281
Stay still.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.700
Tell me...

10:19.118 --> 10:20.619
...wretch...

10:20.870 --> 10:24.581
...how now shall you challenge me?

10:29.420 --> 10:32.922
You have nothing left...

10:33.841 --> 10:34.841
...but your...

10:35.051 --> 10:36.426
...death!

10:39.138 --> 10:40.138
Bain.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.681
Look at me.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.100
You look at me.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.065
Little to your left.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.610
That's it.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.795
Bain! Hold on!

11:53.045 --> 11:54.379
What was that?

11:55.172 --> 11:55.839
What happened?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.549
It fell. I saw it.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.095
It's dead.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.684
Smaug is dead.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.853
By my beard...

12:10.104 --> 12:11.896
...I think he's right.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.523
Look there!

12:15.484 --> 12:19.195
The Ravens of Erebor
are returning to the Mountain.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.030
Aye.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.741
Word will spread.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.992
Before long...

12:24.118 --> 12:26.911
...every soul in Middle-earth will know...

12:27.163 --> 12:29.247
...the dragon is dead!

13:06.702 --> 13:07.702
You are not...

13:07.912 --> 13:09.037
...alone...

13:09.288 --> 13:10.705
...Mithrandir.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.179
Help me!

13:26.305 --> 13:27.889
Where's my baby?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.140
Please!

13:29.225 --> 13:31.267
Somebody help me!

13:31.519 --> 13:32.727
Help!

13:37.983 --> 13:39.526
Over there!

13:40.486 --> 13:41.528
Da!

13:42.404 --> 13:43.404
Da!

13:43.489 --> 13:45.615
- Da!
- Da!

13:52.456 --> 13:54.374
Aah! Why me?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.425
Tauriel.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.719
Kili!

14:07.346 --> 14:08.346
Come on.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.973
We're leaving!

14:10.724 --> 14:12.350
They are your people. You must go.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.062
Come with me.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.732
I know how I feel. I'm not afraid.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.359
You make me feel alive.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.193
I can't.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.653
Tauriel.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.953
I don't know what that means.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.456
I think you do.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.860
One more!

15:20.628 --> 15:21.878
Keep it.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.880
As a promise.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.451
These are dry. You'll need them.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.702
- Thank you.
- Here.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.871
Oi! Give me one of them.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.289
I'll catch my death...

15:58.540 --> 15:59.540
...in this cold.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.792
Find your own!

16:01.001 --> 16:02.877
You're not in charge,
Alfrid Lickspittle.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.253
You are wrong.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.255
In the absence of the Master...

16:06.507 --> 16:07.465
...the power cedes to his deputy...

16:07.716 --> 16:09.759
...which in this instance is my good self.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.678
Now give me that blanket!

16:13.472 --> 16:14.764
Master's deputy?

16:15.015 --> 16:16.641
Don't make me laugh.

16:16.892 --> 16:17.976
You're a sneak-thief.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.519
I'll be dead before...

16:19.770 --> 16:20.895
...I answer to you.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.439
Maybe that can be arranged.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.531
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid.
Not now.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.705
- Da!
- Come here!

16:38.956 --> 16:40.081
You're alive.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.167
It's all right, darling.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.381
It was Bard! He killed the dragon!

16:48.924 --> 16:50.842
I saw it with me own eyes.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.343
He brought the beast down!

16:52.594 --> 16:53.594
Shot him dead...

16:53.679 --> 16:54.929
...with a Black Arrow.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.433
Thank you, Bard!

16:58.684 --> 17:00.101
- Good man.
- Thank you!

17:03.063 --> 17:04.188
You've saved us all!

17:04.440 --> 17:05.647
Bless you.

17:07.608 --> 17:11.112
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer!

17:11.613 --> 17:12.905
All hail...

17:13.156 --> 17:14.824
...King Bard!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.578
I have said it many times.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.998
This is a man of noble stock.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.375
- A born leader!
- Do not call me that.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
I'm not Master...

17:26.252 --> 17:27.295
...of this town.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.422
Where is he?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.884
- Where's the Master?
- Halfway down the Anduin.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.344
With all our coin, I don't doubt.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.721
You would know.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.057
You helped him empty...

17:39.308 --> 17:41.184
- ...the treasury.
- No.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.560
I tried to stop him.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.811
- Liar!
- Cheat!

17:44.730 --> 17:45.730
You're a mongrel!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.648
I begged. I pleaded.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.109
Away with him!

17:50.152 --> 17:51.861
- Tar him!
- I said, "Master...

17:52.112 --> 17:53.446
...no!

17:56.617 --> 17:58.201
Think of the children."

17:58.452 --> 17:59.452
Hang him!

18:00.120 --> 18:02.580
"Will nobody think of the children?"

18:03.540 --> 18:04.540
Ow!

18:05.793 --> 18:07.085
To the tree with him!

18:12.466 --> 18:14.258
- Hang him hard!
- Take him down!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.178
Enough! Let him go!

18:17.429 --> 18:18.513
Let him go!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.309
Look around you!

18:24.436 --> 18:25.436
Have you not...

18:25.521 --> 18:27.271
...had your fill of death?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.734
Winter is upon us.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.403
We must look to our own.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.448
To the sick and the helpless.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.493
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.245
Those who have strength, follow me.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.539
We must salvage what we can.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.207
What then? What'll we do then?

18:51.046 --> 18:52.547
We find shelter.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.010
Hello!

19:41.054 --> 19:42.305
Bombur?

19:43.515 --> 19:44.724
Bifur?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.226
Anybody?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.152
Wait!

19:56.820 --> 19:57.820
Wait!

19:57.863 --> 19:58.988
- It's Bilbo!
- He's alive!

19:59.239 --> 20:00.865
Stop! Stop!

20:01.241 --> 20:02.325
Stop.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.826
You need to leave.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.494
We all need to leave.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.246
We only just got here.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.332
I've tried talking, but he won't listen.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.292
- What do you mean, laddie?
- Thorin!

20:11.543 --> 20:14.253
Thorin. Thorin.
He's been down there for days.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.297
He doesn't sleep. He barely eats.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.634
He's not been himself. Not at all.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.595
It's this place. Ahem.
I think a sickness lies on it.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.971
Sickness?

20:24.806 --> 20:26.390
What kind of sickness?

20:28.727 --> 20:29.810
Fili.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.062
Fili!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.897
Fili!

21:03.303 --> 21:04.303
Gold.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.016
Gold beyond measure.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.187
Beyond sorrow...

21:13.689 --> 21:15.314
...and grief.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.489
Behold...

21:23.991 --> 21:24.991
...the great...

21:25.325 --> 21:28.661
...treasure hoard of Thror.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.545
Welcome...

21:38.297 --> 21:40.256
...my sister-sons...

21:44.094 --> 21:45.761
...to the Kingdom...

21:46.763 --> 21:48.723
...of Erebor.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.227
Balin!

21:56.606 --> 21:57.857
Kili!

21:59.276 --> 22:00.901
Thank Durin, you're alive.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.154
Bombur!

22:03.405 --> 22:04.739
You're alive!

22:07.200 --> 22:09.410
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing yet.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.745
Nothing here.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.414
- Keep searching!
- That jewel could be anywhere.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.750
The Arkenstone is in these halls.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.293
- Find it!
- You heard him.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.628
- Keep looking.
- All of you!

22:20.797 --> 22:22.048
No one rests until...

22:22.299 --> 22:23.382
...it is found.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.539
I am almost tempted...

22:55.791 --> 22:58.125
...to let you take it.

22:59.169 --> 22:59.835
If only...

23:00.087 --> 23:01.796
...to see Oakenshield...

23:02.047 --> 23:03.255
...suffer.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.508
Watch it...

23:05.759 --> 23:07.218
...destroy him.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.095
Watch it corrupt...

23:09.346 --> 23:10.805
...his heart...

23:11.598 --> 23:13.891
...and drive him mad.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.171
I've got you.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.427
Take only what you need.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.679
We have a long march ahead.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.431
Where will you go?

23:55.475 --> 23:57.143
There is only one place.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.939
The Mountain.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.608
You are a genius, sire.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.653
We can take refuge inside the Mountain.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.990
It might smell a bit of dragon,
but the women can clean that up.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.534
It'll be safe and warm and dry...

24:13.785 --> 24:15.244
...and full of stores...

24:15.495 --> 24:17.329
...bedding, clothing...

24:18.081 --> 24:19.874
...the odd bit of gold.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.544
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.838
We will take only
what was promised to us.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.548
Only what we need to rebuild...

24:27.799 --> 24:28.799
...our lives.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.344
Here. Pull your weight.

24:32.596 --> 24:36.056
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.017
Aye.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.855
Others will now look to the Mountain...

24:44.608 --> 24:46.233
...for its wealth...

24:46.485 --> 24:47.902
...for its position.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.570
What is it you know?

24:50.697 --> 24:52.323
Nothing for certain.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.576
It's what I fear may come.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.855
You saw something out there.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.150
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town,
I know who he is.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.612
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.949
A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.659
They fled into the North.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.828
These Orcs were different
from the others.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.372
They bore a mark
I have not seen for a long time.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.165
The mark of Gundabad.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.500
Gundabad?

26:26.751 --> 26:27.751
An Orc stronghold...

26:28.003 --> 26:30.004
...in the far North of the Misty Mountains.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.771
You may tell my father...

26:48.023 --> 26:51.150
...if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.069
Legolas.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.822
It is your king's command.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.538
I ride North. Will you come with me?

27:04.789 --> 27:05.789
To where?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.291
To Gundabad.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.043
I come for Mithrandir...

29:16.880 --> 29:18.714
...and I will leave with him.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.762
If you try to stop me...

29:25.597 --> 29:27.431
...I will destroy you.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.632
Nine...

30:01.883 --> 30:05.093
...for mortal Men doomed to die.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.257
I am not alone.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.688
Are you in need of assistance, my lady?

31:02.443 --> 31:04.069
You should've stayed...

31:04.320 --> 31:05.362
...dead.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.640
Mithrandir...

31:35.393 --> 31:36.393
...come back.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.591
He is here.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.927
Yes.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.471
The darkness has returned.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.355
Go on!

32:25.276 --> 32:26.485
Gandalf!

32:29.238 --> 32:29.947
Gandalf!

32:30.198 --> 32:31.198
Climb on!

32:31.908 --> 32:33.033
He is weak.

32:33.284 --> 32:36.787
He cannot remain here.
It is draining his life.

32:41.042 --> 32:41.750
Go!

32:42.001 --> 32:43.001
Quickly!

32:44.462 --> 32:46.338
Come with me, my lady.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.099
Go!

34:07.837 --> 34:10.172
You have no...

34:10.422 --> 34:12.674
...power here...

34:13.176 --> 34:15.761
...servant of Morgoth.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.221
You...

34:18.473 --> 34:21.766
...are nameless.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.145
Faceless.

34:26.147 --> 34:29.232
Formless.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.906
Go back to the void...

34:36.157 --> 34:39.034
...from whence you came!

35:01.808 --> 35:04.142
The spirit of Sauron endured.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.145
And has been banished.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.648
He will flee into the East.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.609
Gondor...

35:12.860 --> 35:13.860
...should be warned.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.488
They must set a watch
on the walls of Mordor.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.281
No.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.733
Look after the Lady Galadriel.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.244
She has spent much of her power.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.329
Her strength is failing.

35:24.580 --> 35:25.914
Take her to Lothlórien.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.541
My Lord Saruman.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.459
He must be hunted down...

35:29.710 --> 35:31.711
...and destroyed once and for all.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.797
Without the Ring of Power...

35:34.048 --> 35:37.634
...Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.054
Go now.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.808
Leave Sauron to me.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.984
- I need that horse.
- What?

35:54.944 --> 35:58.321
- Gandalf, where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.

35:59.782 --> 36:01.783
They have no idea what is coming.
I saw them...

36:02.076 --> 36:05.328
...with my own eyes,
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.415
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.751
The battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.044
Wait.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.424
Take this.

36:20.428 --> 36:24.181
If what you say is true,
then you'll need it more than I.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.393
Thank you.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.147
A word of warning, eh?

36:32.398 --> 36:33.678
It can be a bit dicky sometimes.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.902
You just have to twiddle with the top.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.113
I expect you'll manage.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.622
It is here in these halls.

36:48.873 --> 36:49.915
I know it.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.958
We have searched and searched.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.210
Not well enough.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.754
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.924
And yet, it is still not found!

37:01.761 --> 37:05.680
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

37:14.482 --> 37:16.233
The Arkenstone...

37:17.151 --> 37:19.277
...is the birthright of our people.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.948
It is The King's Jewel.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.825
Am I not the king?

37:37.171 --> 37:38.672
Know this:

37:42.134 --> 37:44.386
If anyone should find it...

37:45.221 --> 37:47.222
...and withhold it from me...

37:49.058 --> 37:50.934
...I will be avenged.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.076
Dragon-sickness.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.246
I've seen it before.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.499
That look.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.710
The terrible need.

38:18.045 --> 38:21.172
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.885
It sent his grandfather mad.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.514
Balin, if Thorin...

38:30.599 --> 38:32.350
...had the Arkenstone...

38:33.644 --> 38:34.352
...or if...

38:34.603 --> 38:35.603
...it was found...

38:38.149 --> 38:39.649
...would it help?

38:42.278 --> 38:45.989
That stone crowns all.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.035
It is the summit of this great wealth...

38:50.286 --> 38:51.328
...bestowing power...

38:51.579 --> 38:53.538
...upon he who bears it.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.707
Would it stay his madness?

38:57.376 --> 38:58.668
No, laddie.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.547
I fear it would make him worse.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.093
Perhaps it is best...

39:08.220 --> 39:09.888
...it remains lost.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.986
What is that?

39:26.447 --> 39:27.989
In your hand.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.240
It's nothing.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.784
Show me.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.745
It...

39:40.711 --> 39:43.254
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.094
You've carried it all this way?

39:49.345 --> 39:51.137
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.972
In Bag End.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.770
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.

40:00.606 --> 40:01.940
One day, it'll grow.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.027
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.073
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

40:11.158 --> 40:13.284
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.129
Thorin, I...

40:24.380 --> 40:25.630
Thorin.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.966
Survivors from Lake-town...

40:28.509 --> 40:30.385
...they're streaming into Dale.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.513
There's hundreds of them.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.142
Call everyone to the gate.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.519
To the gate!

40:39.770 --> 40:40.812
Now!

41:11.844 --> 41:13.094
Come on.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.429
- Keep moving.
- Sire!

41:15.890 --> 41:17.557
Sire!

41:17.808 --> 41:19.225
Up here!

41:27.943 --> 41:30.236
Look, sire! The braziers are lit.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.696
So...

41:32.823 --> 41:35.658
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.118
Survived?

41:38.287 --> 41:40.246
There's a bunch of Dwarves
with all that gold?

41:41.749 --> 41:43.416
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.710
There's gold enough
in that Mountain for all.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.046
Make camp here tonight!

41:48.631 --> 41:50.006
Find what shelter you can.

41:50.257 --> 41:51.883
Get some fires going.

41:52.134 --> 41:54.302
- Come on, hurry along now.
- Alfrid.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.762
You'll take...

41:55.846 --> 41:56.846
...the night watch.

42:05.731 --> 42:06.731
Up it goes!

42:10.569 --> 42:11.736
That's it.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.534
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.953
This Mountain was hard-won.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.121
I will not see it taken again.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.499
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.125
They came to us in need.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.836
They have lost everything.

42:29.088 --> 42:32.215
Do not tell me what they have lost.

42:33.092 --> 42:35.510
I know well enough their hardship.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.138
Those who have lived through dragon fire...

42:39.390 --> 42:40.598
...should rejoice.

42:41.934 --> 42:42.934
They have much...

42:43.018 --> 42:44.352
...to be grateful for.

42:49.692 --> 42:50.817
More stone.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.822
Bring more stone to the gate!

42:56.073 --> 42:57.115
That's it.

43:17.469 --> 43:20.054
- These children are starving.
- We need food.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.473
- We won't last three days.
- Bard...

43:22.725 --> 43:25.226
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.521
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

43:29.064 --> 43:30.732
We need more water.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.318
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.736
Here you are.

43:35.696 --> 43:36.696
Good morning, Alfrid.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.157
What news from the night watch?

43:39.408 --> 43:41.951
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.

43:42.494 --> 43:44.370
Nothing gets past me.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.547
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.423
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

44:37.675 --> 44:40.051
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.113
Here you go.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.573
Pass it back.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.575
Another one.

45:08.622 --> 45:09.622
You have saved us.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.833
I do not know how to thank you.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.918
Your gratitude is misplaced.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.713
I did not come on your behalf.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.841
I came to reclaim something of mine.

45:27.057 --> 45:30.518
There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.

45:31.311 --> 45:34.397
White gems of pure starlight.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.525
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.405
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.996
Wait! Please wait!

45:53.459 --> 45:55.877
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

45:56.128 --> 45:59.714
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.466
We are allies in this.

46:02.968 --> 46:03.718
My people...

46:03.969 --> 46:06.679
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

46:07.222 --> 46:07.972
Let me...

46:08.223 --> 46:09.474
...speak with Thorin.

46:10.058 --> 46:12.477
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

46:12.728 --> 46:14.061
To avoid war?

46:14.897 --> 46:15.938
Yes.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.733
Not a bad night's work.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.069
Come on.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.345
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

46:47.596 --> 46:50.097
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.808
Why do you come to the gates...

46:52.059 --> 46:54.519
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

46:54.770 --> 46:57.647
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

46:58.357 --> 47:00.691
...like a robber in his hold?

47:01.360 --> 47:04.445
Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

47:05.489 --> 47:06.531
My lord...

47:07.407 --> 47:09.367
...we have not come to rob you...

47:09.618 --> 47:11.869
...but to seek fair settlement.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.413
Will you not speak with me?

47:49.449 --> 47:50.783
I am listening.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.703
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...

47:53.954 --> 47:55.997
...I ask that you honor your pledge.

47:56.623 --> 47:57.915
A share of the treasure...

47:58.166 --> 48:00.167
...so that they might rebuild their lives.

48:01.086 --> 48:03.379
I will not treat with any man...

48:03.922 --> 48:06.382
...while an armed host lies before my door.

48:06.633 --> 48:10.303
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.348
And your threats do not sway me.

48:16.184 --> 48:17.643
What of your conscience?

48:18.228 --> 48:21.063
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

48:22.441 --> 48:24.984
My people offered you help.

48:26.987 --> 48:30.573
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

48:30.824 --> 48:34.035
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

48:34.286 --> 48:35.578
A bargain was struck!

48:35.829 --> 48:37.038
A bargain?

48:37.289 --> 48:40.166
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...

48:40.417 --> 48:42.209
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...

48:42.461 --> 48:44.670
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?

48:45.505 --> 48:47.715
You call that a fair trade?

48:49.843 --> 48:51.177
Tell me...

48:51.428 --> 48:53.054
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer...

48:54.848 --> 48:57.308
...why should I honor such terms?

48:59.478 --> 49:01.437
Because you gave us your word.

49:05.692 --> 49:07.860
Does that mean nothing?

49:22.417 --> 49:23.584
Be gone!

49:24.461 --> 49:25.461
Ere our arrows...

49:25.587 --> 49:26.712
...fly!

49:44.731 --> 49:46.023
What are you doing?

49:47.567 --> 49:50.236
You cannot go to war.

49:51.405 --> 49:53.698
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

49:53.949 --> 49:57.410
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

49:57.661 --> 50:00.454
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.790
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

50:05.460 --> 50:06.669
Not for much longer.

50:08.463 --> 50:09.463
What does that mean?

50:09.715 --> 50:11.465
It means, Master Baggins...

50:14.511 --> 50:16.846
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.351
We have reclaimed Erebor.

50:23.603 --> 50:24.854
Now...

50:25.105 --> 50:26.689
...we defend it.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.375
He will give us nothing.

50:47.794 --> 50:49.003
Such a pity.

50:49.254 --> 50:49.879
Still...

50:50.130 --> 50:52.631
- ...you tried.
- I do not understand.

50:53.842 --> 50:54.925
Why?

50:55.677 --> 50:57.178
Why would he risk war?

51:10.609 --> 51:12.902
It is fruitless to reason with them.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.153
They understand...

51:14.404 --> 51:15.738
...only one thing.

51:19.701 --> 51:20.910
We attack at dawn.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.623
Are you with us?

51:57.405 --> 51:58.405
Aye.

52:02.285 --> 52:04.703
Master Baggins, come here.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.639
You're going to need this.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.392
Put it on.

52:31.398 --> 52:34.150
This vest is made of silver steel.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.028
Mithril...

52:38.280 --> 52:40.447
...it was called by my forebears.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.661
No blade can pierce it.

52:56.965 --> 52:57.965
I look absurd.

52:58.216 --> 53:00.217
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

53:00.468 --> 53:01.927
It is a gift.

53:03.471 --> 53:05.014
A token of our friendship.

53:08.393 --> 53:10.769
True friends are hard to come by.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.106
I have been blind...

53:14.357 --> 53:16.233
...but now I begin to see.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.111
I am betrayed.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.822
Betrayed?

53:22.365 --> 53:24.200
The Arkenstone.

53:33.668 --> 53:35.169
One of them has taken it.

53:42.427 --> 53:45.304
One of them is false.

53:46.348 --> 53:47.514
Thorin...

53:48.350 --> 53:51.518
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.978
Is that not enough?

53:53.230 --> 53:55.731
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

53:56.399 --> 54:00.069
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.570
Now, is this treasure...

54:01.821 --> 54:04.323
...truly worth more than your honor?

54:04.574 --> 54:06.992
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.495
For that, I am grateful.

54:09.746 --> 54:11.580
It was nobly done, but the treasure...

54:11.831 --> 54:13.499
...does not belong to the people...

54:13.750 --> 54:15.000
...of Lake-town.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.252
This gold...

54:20.298 --> 54:21.840
...is ours.

54:25.011 --> 54:26.262
And ours alone.

54:29.766 --> 54:31.350
By my life...

54:32.269 --> 54:35.187
...I will not part...

54:35.939 --> 54:39.233
...with a single coin.

54:40.902 --> 54:42.528
Not...

54:43.530 --> 54:45.030
...one...

54:45.615 --> 54:47.616
...piece of it.

55:08.596 --> 55:09.888
Gundabad.

55:13.184 --> 55:14.852
What lies beyond?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.854
An old enemy.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.188
The ancient kingdom...

55:18.440 --> 55:19.648
...of Angmar.

55:23.194 --> 55:25.154
This fortress was once its stronghold.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.698
It is where they kept their great armories.

55:27.949 --> 55:30.451
Forged their weapons of war.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.495
A light. I saw movement.

55:36.624 --> 55:38.584
We wait for the cover of night.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.754
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.590
In another age, our people waged war...

55:44.841 --> 55:46.008
...on those lands.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.811
My mother died there.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.732
My father does not speak of it.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.110
There is no grave.

56:06.696 --> 56:08.155
No memory.

56:10.784 --> 56:11.909
Nothing.

56:18.958 --> 56:21.418
- Unh!
- Let me through!

56:22.796 --> 56:24.129
Make way!

56:39.020 --> 56:40.396
No, no.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.940
No! Oi! You!

56:43.525 --> 56:44.608
Pointy hat!

56:45.777 --> 56:46.819
Yes.

56:47.070 --> 56:50.072
You. We don't want no tramps, beggars...

56:50.323 --> 56:51.615
...nor vagabonds here.

56:51.866 --> 56:53.951
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.996
Off you go. On your horse.

56:58.248 --> 56:59.915
Who's in charge here?

57:00.166 --> 57:01.208
Who is asking?

57:05.797 --> 57:08.715
You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.008
War is coming!

57:10.260 --> 57:11.385
The cesspits...

57:11.636 --> 57:13.011
...of Dol Guldur have been...

57:13.263 --> 57:14.263
...emptied.

57:14.305 --> 57:15.013
You're all...

57:15.265 --> 57:16.348
...in mortal danger.

57:16.599 --> 57:17.891
What are you talking about?

57:19.144 --> 57:20.227
You know nothing...

57:20.478 --> 57:21.728
...of Wizards.

57:21.980 --> 57:24.231
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

57:24.482 --> 57:27.985
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.780
But sometimes a storm...

57:32.031 --> 57:33.657
...is just a storm.

57:33.908 --> 57:35.409
Not this time.

57:35.660 --> 57:38.120
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

57:38.371 --> 57:40.706
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

57:40.957 --> 57:43.584
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.377
Why show his hand now?

57:45.628 --> 57:46.879
Because we forced him.

57:47.130 --> 57:50.299
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...

57:50.550 --> 57:51.925
...their homeland.

57:52.177 --> 57:54.344
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.

57:54.596 --> 57:57.347
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.

57:57.599 --> 58:01.101
His master seeks control of the Mountain.

58:01.811 --> 58:03.437
Not just for the treasure within...

58:03.688 --> 58:07.274
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.

58:07.984 --> 58:09.193
This is the gateway...

58:09.444 --> 58:12.613
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.

58:12.864 --> 58:16.033
If that fell kingdom should rise again...

58:16.576 --> 58:20.162
...Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire...

58:20.413 --> 58:22.206
...even Gondor itself, will fall.

58:22.957 --> 58:26.043
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...

58:27.003 --> 58:28.462
...where are they?

59:21.933 --> 59:24.351
These bats are bred for one purpose.

59:24.602 --> 59:25.852
For what?

59:28.022 --> 59:29.314
For war.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.999
Come on, let's get those blades sharpened.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.418
Aye. Blasted Elves.

01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:33.587
- You swing an ax at it?
- No, brother.

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.148
You should be inside.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.860
Out of the wind.

01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:58.654
No, I...

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:03.116
...needed some air.
Place still stinks of dragon.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.826
The Elves have been moving...

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:13.085
- ...their archers into position.
- Ah.

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:16.630
The battle will be over...

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:18.048
...by tomorrow's eve.

01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:21.009
Though I doubt we will live
to see it.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:27.057
No, these are dark days.

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.477
Dark days indeed.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:33.730
Hmm.

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.193
No one could blame a soul
for wishing themselves elsewhere.

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:46.243
Must be nearing midnight.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.078
Bombur's got the next watch.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.872
It'll take a bit to wake him.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:54.418
Bofur?

01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.589
I will see you in the morning.

01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:03.427
Goodbye, Bilbo.

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:50.766
Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.684
What do you think I'm trying to do?

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.479
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.939
...your loyalty to them.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.942
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.112
You started this, Mithrandir.

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:07.657
You will forgive me if I finish it.

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:09.618
Are the archers in position?

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.704
- Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.582
If anything moves on that Mountain...

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:16.917
...kill it.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.172
The Dwarves are out of time.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:23.423
Bowman!

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:25.675
Do you agree?

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.220
Is gold so important to you?

01:03:29.013 --> 01:03:31.515
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:33.308
It won't come to that.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:36.311
- This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.

01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:39.481
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.525
They will fight to the death.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.235
Bilbo Baggins.

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.028
If I'm not mistaken...

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:47.697
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.574
...to my dungeons from under...

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.660
...the nose of my guards.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.247
Yes.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:56.998
Sorry...

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.416
...about that.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960
I came...

01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:02.712
...to give you...

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:03.964
...this.

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:10.595
The Heart of the Mountain.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.849
The King's Jewel.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:17.310
And worth a king's ransom.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.980
How is this...

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:21.356
...yours to give?

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:23.608
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:26.361
Why would you do this?

01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:27.863
You owe us no loyalty.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.823
I'm not doing it for you.

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.910
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:35.704
...and pigheaded...

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:37.539
...and difficult.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.583
They're suspicious and secretive...

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.376
...with the worst manners...

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:43.670
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:45.171
...and kind...

01:04:46.757 --> 01:04:48.091
...and loyal to a fault.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.260
I've grown...

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:53.054
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:54.931
Now, Thorin...

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:57.434
...values this stone above all else.

01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:00.061
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.396
...what you are owed.

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:02.647
There will be no need...

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:03.857
...for war.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280
Rest up tonight.

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:13.199
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:16.369
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.372
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.625
There is no Company. Not anymore.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.356
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.171
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.714
Well, you should be.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:29.299
Don't underestimate...

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:31.468
...the evil of gold.

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:32.719
Gold over which...

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.055
...a serpent has long brooded.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:37.849
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.768
...who come near this Mountain.

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:42.395
Almost all. Heh.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.566
You there.

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:47.901
Find this Hobbit a bed...

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.820
...and fill his belly with hot food.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.990
He's earned it.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.285
Hey.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.079
Keep an eye on him.

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:00.872
If he should try...

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.958
...to leave, you tell me.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.795
Move it!

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.505
Stupid Hobbit.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.208
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit. Up you get.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.357
I will put the next one between your eyes.

01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:35.633
We have come to tell you...

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.137
...payment of your debt has been offered...

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.847
...and accepted.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.308
What payment?

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.769
I gave you nothing.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.271
You have nothing.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.654
We have this.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:01.951
They have the Arkenstone.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.704
Thieves!

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.458
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:10.210
That stone belongs to the king!

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.046
And the king may have it...

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.423
...with our goodwill.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.307
But first he must honor his word.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.478
They are taking us for fools.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.564
This is a ruse.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.901
A filthy lie.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:39.154
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

01:08:39.406 --> 01:08:40.532
It is a trick!

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.408
It's no trick.

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:44.868
The stone is real.

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:47.997
I gave it to them.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.215
You?

01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:01.803
I took it as my 14th share.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.515
You would steal from me?

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:06.933
Steal from you? No.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:10.395
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:15.524
I'll let it stand against my claim.

01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:17.819
Against your claim?

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.238
Your claim.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.076
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:29.497
I was going to give it to you.

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:33.459
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.002
...thief?

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.505
You are changed, Thorin.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:38.756
The Dwarf I met...

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.885
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.386
Would never have doubted...

01:09:43.636 --> 01:09:45.180
...the loyalty of his kin!

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:48.183
Do not speak to me...

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:50.225
...of loyalty.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.064
Throw him from the rampart!

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:05.366
Did you not hear me?

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.747
I will do it myself. Curse you!

01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:12.582
No!

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:14.083
Cursed be the Wizard...

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.170
- ...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...

01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:18.421
...then please...

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.547
...don't damage him.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:20.924
Return him to me.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:29.766
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:33.853
...are you, Thorin...

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:35.271
...son of Thrain?

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.405
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:45.240
Go.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:46.491
Or Shire rats!

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.039
Are we resolved?

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:54.999
The return...

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.210
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:07.595
Why should I...

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:09.639
...buy back that which is...

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:10.890
...rightfully mine?

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:14.769
Keep the stone...

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.271
...sell it.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.315
Ecthelion of Gondor
will give you a good price for it.

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:20.566
I will kill you!

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.902
By my oath,
I will kill you all!

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:24.737
Your oath means nothing.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.700
I've heard enough.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.710
Thorin...

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:39.919
...lay down your arms.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.047
Open these doors.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:44.674
This treasure...

01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:46.759
...will be your death.

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:48.803
Thorin, we cannot...

01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:50.972
...win this fight.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.567
Give us your answer.

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.403
Will you have peace...

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.489
...or war?

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.961
I will have war.

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.559
Ironfoot.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:59.040
Hey, Thorin!

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:00.875
Ironfoot has come!

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.175
Who is that?

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:10.968
He doesn't look very happy.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.971
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.223
Thorin's...

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.933
- ...cousin.
- Are they alike?

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:21.646
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.032
Good morning.

01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:34.826
How are we all?

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.789
I have a wee proposition...

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.333
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:43.835
...of your time.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.130
Would you consider...

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.383
...just sodding off?

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:52.718
All of you!

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.429
Right now!

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Stand fast.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.683
Come now, Lord Dain.

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:01.227
Gandalf the Grey.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:04.272
Tell this rabble...

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.357
...to leave, or I'll water...

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.276
...the ground with their blood!

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.905
No need for war...

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.825
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:17.076
A legion of Orcs...

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:18.870
...march on the Mountain.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:19.829
Stand down.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.124
I will not stand down before any Elf.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:26.836
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.

01:14:27.838 --> 01:14:30.882
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:32.967
If he chooses...

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:35.887
...to stand between me and my kin...

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.056
...I'll split his pretty head open!

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.227
See if he's still smirking then.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:46.105
Dain...

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:47.356
...wait!

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:53.738
Let them advance.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.740
See how far they get.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.242
You think I give a dead dog
for your threats...

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.203
...you pointy-eared...

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:01.871
...princess?

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.333
You hear that, lads? We're on!

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.252
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.175
Stand your men down.

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:16.802
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble.

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:23.601
Right then.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.686
Let's get this done.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.272
Send in the goats.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:45.498
Thranduil!

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:46.958
This is madness!

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.525
How do you like that,
the old twirley-whirlies?

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.151
Ha, ha, you buggers!

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:22.386
Were-worms.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.147
Oh, come on.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:05.054
The hordes of hell are upon us!

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:07.181
Fight to the death!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.486
I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?

01:18:20.737 --> 01:18:22.697
- Aye!
- Come on, let's go!

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.615
- Stand down.
- What?

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.367
Are we to do nothing?

01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:28.285
I said, stand down!

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.250
The Elves.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.127
Will they not fight?

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:29.930
Charge!

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.182
Yes!

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:36.479
Uh, Gandalf?

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.355
Is this a good place to stand?

01:21:01.898 --> 01:21:03.274
Azog.

01:21:04.776 --> 01:21:06.902
He's trying to cut us off.

01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:12.157
All of you!

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.326
Fall back to Dale!

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.703
Now!

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:19.748
To the city!

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.042
Bilbo! This way!

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:33.906
Sigrid!

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:35.824
Tilda!

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:48.128
My children! Where are my children?

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.298
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:52.758
The market?

01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:54.677
Where are they now?

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:56.512
Tilda! Sigrid!

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:59.431
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:03.686
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.938
Archers! This way!

01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:08.399
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.359
The market's overrun!

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.197
The rest of you...

01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:16.782
...follow me!

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.472
Charge! Onward!

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.891
To the death!

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:14.798
Da!

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.050
Da!

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.093
- Here!
- We're down here!

01:24:46.372 --> 01:24:47.372
Bain!

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:49.166
Sigrid! Get down!

01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:40.008
Listen!

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:40.884
Gather...

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.344
...the women and children.

01:25:42.595 --> 01:25:44.096
Take them to the Great Hall...

01:25:44.347 --> 01:25:45.931
...and barricade the door.

01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:47.432
You understand?

01:25:48.184 --> 01:25:49.893
You must not come out for any reason.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.436
We want to stay with you!

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.897
Show your father some respect.

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:55.482
You leave it to me...

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:56.316
...sire.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:57.818
You heard him.

01:25:58.069 --> 01:25:59.862
- We make for the Great Hall.
- Alfrid!

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:02.489
Women and children only.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:03.740
I need every man...

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:04.575
...fighting.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.118
See that you return.

01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:07.744
I'll get them to safety, sire.

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.749
Then my sword is yours to command.
Get up!

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.460
Look after them.

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:20.549
Shift it, granny!

01:26:32.812 --> 01:26:33.854
Make for the Great Hall!

01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:38.400
Out of my way!

01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:40.611
Abandon the cripples!

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:42.839
You buggers!

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.646
Where's Thorin?

01:27:58.982 --> 01:28:00.941
We need him! Where is he?

01:28:14.205 --> 01:28:16.039
Fall back!

01:28:45.778 --> 01:28:47.612
Since when do we forsake...

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:49.031
...our own people?

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:50.282
Thorin...

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.034
...they are dying...

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.452
...out there.

01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:02.044
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.298
Places we can fortify...

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:09.217
...shore up, make safe.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:10.635
Yes.

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:13.305
Yes...

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:15.515
...that is it.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:18.477
We must move the gold
further underground...

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:20.103
- ...to safety.
- Did you hear me?

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.522
Dain is surrounded.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.483
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

01:29:26.986 --> 01:29:28.445
Many die in war.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.281
Life is cheap.

01:29:33.409 --> 01:29:34.409
But a treasure...

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.620
...such as this cannot be counted...

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.538
...in lives lost.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.126
It is worth...

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:45.879
...all the blood we can spend.

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.966
You sit here in these vast halls...

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.677
...with a crown upon your head...

01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:56.515
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.268
Do not speak to me...

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:03.980
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

01:30:05.858 --> 01:30:06.858
...as if...

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.528
...I were still...

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.032
...Thorin...

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.701
...Oakenshield.

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:21.206
- I am your king!
- You were always my king.

01:30:21.624 --> 01:30:23.500
You used to know that once.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.421
You cannot see what you have become.

01:30:30.883 --> 01:30:32.092
Go.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:36.138
Get out.

01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.475
Before I kill you.

01:30:55.032 --> 01:30:56.199
You sit here...

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.286
...with a crown upon your head.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:01.580
You are lesser now
than you have ever been.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:05.834
But a treasure such as this
cannot be counted in lives lost.

01:31:06.085 --> 01:31:08.086
A sickness lies upon that treasure.

01:31:08.337 --> 01:31:10.714
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.215
Am I not the king?

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:13.800
This gold...

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:15.385
...is ours.

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:17.137
And ours alone.

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:20.765
I will not part...

01:31:21.684 --> 01:31:23.935
...with a single coin.

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:25.979
He could not see
beyond his own desire!

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:28.732
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:31.067
...Thorin Oakenshield.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.821
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:36.698
This is Thorin...

01:31:36.949 --> 01:31:39.576
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:42.037
I am not my grandfather.
I am not my grandfather.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:44.206
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.

01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:46.333
They are dying out there.

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:47.792
Take back Erebor.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:49.461
Dain is surrounded.

01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:50.712
Dying.

01:31:50.963 --> 01:31:51.963
Is surrounded.

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:53.215
Dying.

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:56.301
Take back your homeland.

01:31:56.886 --> 01:31:59.054
You are changed, Thorin.

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.931
I am not my grandfather.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:04.226
Is this treasure truly worth more
than your honor?

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.603
I am not my grandfather.

01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:22.953
This treasure will be your death!

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:06.121
Fall back!

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:07.914
Fall back...

01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:09.833
...to the Mountain!

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:13.962
Fall back!

01:33:56.505 --> 01:33:58.048
I will not hide...

01:33:58.299 --> 01:33:59.633
...behind a wall of stone...

01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:02.802
...while others fight our battles for us!

01:34:06.515 --> 01:34:08.933
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:15.106
No.

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:16.775
It is not.

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:21.071
We are sons of Durin.

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.575
And Durin's Folk...

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:29.371
...do not flee from a fight.

01:34:52.311 --> 01:34:56.189
I have no right to ask this of any of you.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.071
But will you follow me...

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.199
...one last time?

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:52.412
Thorin.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.982
To the king!

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:23.818
To the king!

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:48.593
The Dwarves.

01:36:49.386 --> 01:36:50.678
They're rallying.

01:36:53.849 --> 01:36:56.059
They're rallying to their king.

01:37:11.116 --> 01:37:13.576
Any man who wants to give their last...

01:37:14.245 --> 01:37:15.745
...follow me!

01:37:23.212 --> 01:37:25.505
Come on, Bombur. Get up.

01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:04.335
- Nori.
- Gloin!

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:06.838
Right behind you, brother.

01:38:49.131 --> 01:38:52.842
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.636
- I'm with you.
- Arm yourselves.

01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:57.764
- Come with us.
- No, no, no.

01:38:58.015 --> 01:39:00.350
- You leave an old woman be.
- Don't be afraid.

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:01.851
I said, get off!

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.271
Alfrid Lickspittle.

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:06.522
You are a coward.

01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:07.690
"Coward"?

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:10.360
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.778
You're not a man.

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:13.613
You're a weasel.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.020
Dain!

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:48.064
Thorin!

01:39:49.066 --> 01:39:50.108
Hold on!

01:39:50.359 --> 01:39:51.609
I'm coming!

01:39:59.076 --> 01:40:00.451
Hey, cousin!

01:40:02.454 --> 01:40:03.454
What took you so long?

01:40:08.043 --> 01:40:10.044
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin.

01:40:11.046 --> 01:40:12.213
I hope you've got a plan.

01:40:13.716 --> 01:40:14.841
Aye.

01:40:15.718 --> 01:40:17.552
We're going to take out their leader.

01:40:18.303 --> 01:40:19.345
Azog?

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.560
I'm gonna kill that piece of filth.

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:27.270
Thorin, you cannot do this.

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:28.813
You're our king.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:31.190
That is why I must do it.

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:35.987
And how do you plan to fight your way
single-handed to Ravenhill?

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:37.947
Halt!

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:45.723
It's been a while since I've done this.

01:40:47.916 --> 01:40:49.292
To Ravenhill!

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:50.668
Hold tight, lads.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.421
You're all mad bastards.

01:40:54.339 --> 01:40:55.840
I like it.

01:40:57.634 --> 01:41:00.386
May Durin save you all.

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:42.762
Watch out!

01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:51.979
Eyes front...

01:41:52.022 --> 01:41:53.022
...lads!

01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:03.491
Hold on!

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.415
I'm out!

01:42:20.425 --> 01:42:22.051
Bring it down!

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:24.637
- Shoot it!
- Where?

01:42:24.888 --> 01:42:26.222
In his jambags!

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.182
It doesn't have any jambags!

01:42:28.433 --> 01:42:29.642
- Duck!
- Kili!

01:42:31.895 --> 01:42:33.020
Move it!

01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:36.941
Hang on, lads! I'm coming!

01:42:49.288 --> 01:42:50.288
Bofur, you beauty!

01:42:58.463 --> 01:43:00.131
- Dwalin!
- Go!

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:05.303
Come on...

01:43:05.554 --> 01:43:07.096
...you hairy hedgepig!

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:08.347
Come on!

01:43:12.644 --> 01:43:13.644
Yeah!

01:43:13.896 --> 01:43:15.479
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:18.316
Wargs!

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:35.082
Hold tight, lads.

01:43:50.682 --> 01:43:51.682
There's more coming!

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:57.688
We're pulling too much weight.

01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.273
We won't make it.

01:43:59.524 --> 01:44:00.524
Cut the tracers.

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:03.945
Ride them to Ravenhill.

01:44:04.947 --> 01:44:05.947
No, Balin.

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:09.951
My goat-riding days are over.

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.663
Durin be with you, brother.

01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:45.194
I am too old for this.

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:47.613
Hyah!

01:44:48.573 --> 01:44:49.615
Onwards!

01:44:49.866 --> 01:44:51.492
Lead on!

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.316
Get up.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.109
Get away from me.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.652
I don't take orders...

01:45:26.903 --> 01:45:28.362
...from you.
People trusted you.

01:45:28.613 --> 01:45:29.780
They listened to you.

01:45:30.032 --> 01:45:31.032
The Master's mantle...

01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:33.367
...was there for the taking...

01:45:34.453 --> 01:45:35.786
...and you threw it all away.

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.080
For what?

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:47.840
Alfrid...

01:45:48.091 --> 01:45:49.550
...your slip is showing.

01:47:19.057 --> 01:47:21.392
We may yet survive this.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:23.769
Gandalf!

01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:32.570
It's Thorin.

01:47:33.321 --> 01:47:34.363
And Fili, Kili...

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.365
...and Dwalin.

01:47:37.409 --> 01:47:39.410
He's taking his best warriors.

01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:40.870
To do what?

01:47:41.746 --> 01:47:44.123
To cut the head off the snake.

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:18.908
Die!

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:27.291
Gandalf!

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:29.210
Legolas.

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:32.004
Legolas Greenleaf.

01:48:32.255 --> 01:48:33.464
There is a second army.

01:48:33.715 --> 01:48:36.675
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:38.385
Gundabad.

01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:41.263
This was their plan all along.

01:48:43.975 --> 01:48:47.436
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:49.063
The North?

01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:50.648
Where is the North...

01:48:50.899 --> 01:48:52.983
- ...exactly?
- Ravenhill.

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.236
Ravenhill?

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:57.154
Thorin is up there.

01:48:57.405 --> 01:48:59.406
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.

01:49:15.632 --> 01:49:17.007
Where is he?

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:23.639
It looks empty.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.809
I think Azog has fled.

01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:29.687
I don't think so.

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:33.399
Fili...

01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:35.985
...take your brother.

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:37.486
Scout out the towers.

01:49:38.363 --> 01:49:40.072
Keep low and out of sight.

01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:41.365
If you see something...

01:49:41.616 --> 01:49:42.816
...report back. Do not engage.

01:49:43.034 --> 01:49:45.244
- Do you understand?
- We have company.

01:49:46.538 --> 01:49:47.913
Goblin mercenaries.

01:49:48.164 --> 01:49:49.498
No more than a hundred.

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:51.375
We'll take care of them. Go!

01:49:51.626 --> 01:49:52.793
Go!

01:49:54.379 --> 01:49:55.713
Come on!

01:50:24.075 --> 01:50:25.618
Recall your company.

01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:33.584
My lord, dispatch this force...

01:50:33.835 --> 01:50:35.628
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...

01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:36.879
...to be overrun.

01:50:36.921 --> 01:50:37.921
Thorin must be warned.

01:50:38.006 --> 01:50:40.257
By all means, warn him.

01:50:40.508 --> 01:50:42.843
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...

01:50:43.094 --> 01:50:44.511
...of this accursed land. No more.

01:50:44.763 --> 01:50:46.221
Thranduil?

01:50:47.223 --> 01:50:48.223
I'll go.

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.184
Don't be ridiculous.

01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:51.852
You'll never make it.

01:50:52.103 --> 01:50:53.103
Why not?

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:56.190
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

01:50:57.067 --> 01:50:58.400
No, they won't.

01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:00.944
They won't see me.

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.947
It's out of the question.

01:51:04.949 --> 01:51:05.949
I won't allow it.

01:51:06.951 --> 01:51:09.370
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

01:51:48.076 --> 01:51:50.202
You will not turn away.

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:51.954
Not this time.

01:51:52.622 --> 01:51:54.790
Get out of my way.

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.625
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.919
Yes, they will die.

01:51:59.754 --> 01:52:01.046
Today...

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:02.881
...tomorrow...

01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:05.634
...one year hence,
a hundred years from now.

01:52:06.344 --> 01:52:07.845
What does it matter?

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.596
They are mortal.

01:52:12.809 --> 01:52:14.643
You think your life is worth more...

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:17.438
...when there is no love in it?

01:52:18.106 --> 01:52:21.233
There is no love in you.

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.324
What do you know of love?

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:30.576
Nothing.

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:32.818
What you feel for that Dwarf...

01:52:32.954 --> 01:52:34.246
...is not real.

01:52:36.624 --> 01:52:38.125
You think it is love?

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:41.170
Are you ready to die for it?

01:52:54.642 --> 01:52:56.101
I will go with you.

01:53:18.792 --> 01:53:20.584
Push!

01:53:34.849 --> 01:53:38.018
By Durin, you've lost your ax.

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:40.896
No, he's not.

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.648
There you go, cousin.

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:47.194
You know where you can stick that.

01:53:57.372 --> 01:53:59.248
Hey. Stay here.

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.124
Search the lower levels.

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.669
I've got this.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:14.680
Where is that Orc filth?

01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:18.058
Thorin.

01:54:18.643 --> 01:54:19.810
Bilbo.

01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:21.687
You have to leave here. Now.

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:23.897
Azog has an army attacking
from the North.

01:54:24.148 --> 01:54:25.816
This watchtower will be surrounded.

01:54:26.067 --> 01:54:27.901
- With no way out.
- We are so close.

01:54:28.152 --> 01:54:30.153
That Orc scum is in there.
I say we push on.

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:32.948
No. That's what he wants.

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.867
He wants to draw us in.

01:54:36.953 --> 01:54:38.120
This is a trap.

01:54:46.796 --> 01:54:48.130
Ah.

01:54:54.178 --> 01:54:55.888
Find Fili and Kili. Call them back.

01:54:56.139 --> 01:54:57.639
Thorin, are you sure about this?

01:54:57.891 --> 01:54:58.974
Do it.

01:55:00.810 --> 01:55:02.519
We'll live to fight another day.

01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:25.751
Oh...

01:55:38.348 --> 01:55:39.348
Go.

01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:44.561
Run!

01:56:14.759 --> 01:56:15.926
Kili!

01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:17.844
Thorin.

01:56:20.598 --> 01:56:22.015
Thorin. No.

01:57:45.433 --> 01:57:46.433
No.

01:58:03.367 --> 01:58:04.367
Kili.

02:00:13.664 --> 02:00:14.664
Kili!

02:00:19.712 --> 02:00:20.712
Kili!

02:00:20.963 --> 02:00:21.963
Tauriel!

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:24.382
Kili.

02:01:29.490 --> 02:01:30.490
No!

02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:42.210
No!

02:06:02.471 --> 02:06:04.097
Mm.

02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:21.591
Tauriel!

02:12:15.886 --> 02:12:17.762
The Eagles are coming.

02:13:08.063 --> 02:13:09.063
Bilbo.

02:13:09.106 --> 02:13:11.065
Don't move. Don't move. Lie still.

02:13:12.734 --> 02:13:15.277
Oh. Mm. Mm.

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:16.779
I'm glad you are here.

02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:18.572
- Shh, shh.
- Unh.

02:13:19.533 --> 02:13:21.325
I wish to part from you in friendship.

02:13:21.576 --> 02:13:22.576
No.

02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:24.036
You are not going anywhere.

02:13:24.788 --> 02:13:26.122
You're going to live.

02:13:26.581 --> 02:13:27.581
I would take back...

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.667
...my words and my deeds at the Gate.

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:33.921
You did what only a true friend would do.

02:13:35.382 --> 02:13:36.382
Forgive me.

02:13:39.177 --> 02:13:41.262
I was too blind to see it.

02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.182
I am so sorry...

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.436
...that I have led you into such peril.

02:13:49.604 --> 02:13:52.356
No, I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.

02:13:52.607 --> 02:13:53.899
Each and every one of them.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.281
It is far more than any Baggins deserves.

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:05.703
Farewell...

02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:08.622
...Master Burglar.

02:14:09.958 --> 02:14:12.001
Go back to your books.

02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:15.171
And your armchair.

02:14:16.923 --> 02:14:18.841
Plant your trees.

02:14:19.509 --> 02:14:21.177
Watch them grow.

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:27.975
If more people...

02:14:29.019 --> 02:14:30.644
...valued home...

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:32.855
...above gold...

02:14:33.857 --> 02:14:37.443
...this world would be a merrier place.

02:14:41.239 --> 02:14:43.532
No. No, no, no. No.

02:14:43.784 --> 02:14:46.202
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.

02:14:48.497 --> 02:14:49.622
Thorin.

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.963
Thorin. Thorin, hold on.

02:14:58.215 --> 02:14:59.381
Hold on, please.

02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:01.092
The Eagles...

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.969
The Eagles... The Eagles are here.

02:15:04.638 --> 02:15:05.805
Thorin?

02:15:09.017 --> 02:15:10.142
The Ea...

02:16:06.783 --> 02:16:09.410
I cannot go back.

02:16:10.453 --> 02:16:11.453
Where will you go?

02:16:13.582 --> 02:16:15.082
I do not know.

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:17.751
Go north.

02:16:18.378 --> 02:16:19.962
Find the Dúnedain.

02:16:21.506 --> 02:16:24.758
There's a young Ranger amongst them.
You should meet him.

02:16:26.928 --> 02:16:29.221
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.

02:16:29.806 --> 02:16:31.182
His son...

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:34.018
...might grow to be a great one.

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:37.855
What is his name?

02:16:38.898 --> 02:16:41.275
He's known in the Wild as Strider.

02:16:42.152 --> 02:16:43.777
His true name...

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:46.447
...you must discover for yourself.

02:16:50.493 --> 02:16:51.744
Legolas.

02:16:53.413 --> 02:16:55.164
Your mother loved you.

02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:59.126
More than anyone.

02:17:00.085 --> 02:17:01.712
More than life.

02:17:37.499 --> 02:17:39.415
They want to bury him.

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:42.628
Yes.

02:17:44.129 --> 02:17:46.924
If this is love, I do not want it.

02:17:50.303 --> 02:17:52.054
Take it from me.

02:17:52.806 --> 02:17:54.389
Please.

02:17:59.853 --> 02:18:02.481
Why does it hurt so much?

02:18:03.525 --> 02:18:05.566
Because it was real.

02:22:13.441 --> 02:22:16.652
The king is dead.

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:19.905
Long live the king!

02:22:20.156 --> 02:22:21.532
Long live the king!

02:22:30.667 --> 02:22:32.834
There is to be a great feast tonight.

02:22:33.086 --> 02:22:36.338
Songs will be sung. Tales will be told.

02:22:37.090 --> 02:22:39.216
And Thorin Oakenshield...

02:22:39.467 --> 02:22:41.510
...will pass into legend.

02:22:42.845 --> 02:22:44.555
I know that's how you must honor him.

02:22:44.806 --> 02:22:46.682
But to me, he was never that.

02:22:47.892 --> 02:22:49.142
He was...

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.812
To me...

02:22:53.606 --> 02:22:54.856
...he was...

02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:04.950
I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?

02:23:05.201 --> 02:23:06.994
You can tell them yourself.

02:23:23.303 --> 02:23:26.638
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh...

02:23:31.728 --> 02:23:33.020
...tea is at 4.

02:23:34.647 --> 02:23:36.231
There's plenty of it.

02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:40.777
You are welcome anytime.

02:23:46.743 --> 02:23:48.118
Uh...

02:23:49.537 --> 02:23:51.038
Don't bother knocking.

02:24:33.623 --> 02:24:35.791
Ah, the borders of the Shire.

02:24:37.752 --> 02:24:39.544
It is here I must leave you.

02:24:42.215 --> 02:24:43.590
That's a shame.

02:24:46.135 --> 02:24:47.803
I quite liked having...

02:24:48.054 --> 02:24:49.763
...a Wizard around.

02:24:51.015 --> 02:24:52.766
Seems they bring good luck.

02:24:53.851 --> 02:24:57.229
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes...

02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:59.648
...were managed by mere luck?

02:25:00.650 --> 02:25:03.819
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.

02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:05.362
Don't take me for a fool.

02:25:05.613 --> 02:25:08.073
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels.

02:25:08.324 --> 02:25:10.367
And I've kept my eye on you...

02:25:10.618 --> 02:25:11.702
...ever since.

02:25:14.872 --> 02:25:16.456
Well, thank goodness.

02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:22.796
Farewell, Gandalf.

02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:27.134
Farewell.

02:25:34.308 --> 02:25:35.559
You, uh...

02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:39.438
You needn't worry about that ring.
Fell out of my pocket during the battle.

02:25:39.689 --> 02:25:40.772
I lost it.

02:25:41.691 --> 02:25:44.985
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.

02:25:45.945 --> 02:25:46.945
And I'm very fond...

02:25:47.196 --> 02:25:48.363
...of you.

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:52.409
But you're only quite a little fellow...

02:25:53.661 --> 02:25:56.496
...in a wide world after all.

02:26:27.779 --> 02:26:30.655
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.

02:26:30.907 --> 02:26:33.200
And that's my dining chair.

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:36.453
Ah... Put that pouf down!

02:26:36.704 --> 02:26:38.205
What is going on?

02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:39.790
Hello...

02:26:39.916 --> 02:26:40.916
...Mr. Bilbo.

02:26:41.042 --> 02:26:42.667
You're not supposed to be here.

02:26:42.919 --> 02:26:44.544
What do you mean?

02:26:44.796 --> 02:26:46.379
On account of you
being presumed dead.

02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.799
I am not dead.

02:26:49.050 --> 02:26:50.884
Presumed or otherwise.

02:26:52.011 --> 02:26:53.929
I'm not sure that's permitted.

02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:55.764
Mr. Bilbo!

02:26:56.015 --> 02:26:58.433
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?

02:26:58.684 --> 02:27:00.435
Any advance on 21?

02:27:00.812 --> 02:27:03.563
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.

02:27:03.815 --> 02:27:06.191
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:09.361
Any bids for this?

02:27:09.612 --> 02:27:11.947
This is Shire-made.

02:27:12.198 --> 02:27:13.990
No Dwarvish reproductions here.

02:27:14.242 --> 02:27:15.242
Stop!

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:16.743
Stop!

02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:19.037
- There's been a mistake!
- Who are you?

02:27:19.288 --> 02:27:20.288
Who am I?

02:27:20.540 --> 02:27:21.998
You know who I am...

02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:24.084
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

02:27:24.335 --> 02:27:25.710
This is my home.

02:27:25.962 --> 02:27:28.213
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

02:27:28.464 --> 02:27:30.090
- This is most irregular.
- Excuse me.

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.341
It's been more...

02:27:31.425 --> 02:27:33.718
...than 13 months since the disappearance.

02:27:33.970 --> 02:27:35.595
If you are in fact...

02:27:35.847 --> 02:27:38.890
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased...

02:27:39.141 --> 02:27:40.684
...can you prove it?

02:27:40.935 --> 02:27:41.935
What?

02:27:41.978 --> 02:27:43.603
Something official with your name...

02:27:43.855 --> 02:27:44.938
...on it would suffice.

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:47.065
All right. Right.

02:27:49.944 --> 02:27:52.237
A contract of employment as a bur...

02:27:54.907 --> 02:27:55.907
Never mind as what.

02:27:57.869 --> 02:27:59.244
There. My signature.

02:27:59.495 --> 02:28:01.496
Yes, well... Uh...

02:28:01.747 --> 02:28:03.582
Well, it certainly seems to be in order.

02:28:03.833 --> 02:28:04.958
Yes.

02:28:05.209 --> 02:28:07.252
Seems there can be no doubt.

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:10.088
Who is this you pledged
your service to?

02:28:12.133 --> 02:28:13.675
Thorin Oakenshield?

02:28:17.138 --> 02:28:18.138
He...

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:20.765
He was my friend.

02:30:15.715 --> 02:30:17.132
No, thank you!

02:30:17.383 --> 02:30:19.551
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers...

02:30:19.802 --> 02:30:22.012
...or distant relations!

02:30:22.263 --> 02:30:23.346
And what about...

02:30:23.597 --> 02:30:25.348
...very old friends?

02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:33.940
Gandalf?

02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:35.442
Bilbo Baggins.

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:37.652
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha!

02:30:37.903 --> 02:30:39.112
It's good to see you.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:42.949
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?

02:30:47.163 --> 02:30:49.122
Come on, come in!

02:30:49.373 --> 02:30:51.666
Welcome. Welcome.
