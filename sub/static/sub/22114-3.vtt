00:13.525 --> 00:14.583
Where's our food?

00:14.584 --> 00:17.500
It's... the service
of this place, it's horrible.

00:17.501 --> 00:18.667
- Taking a year.
- I know.

00:18.668 --> 00:20.541
- What the hell?
- I know.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.083
I confirmed it, by the way.

00:22.084 --> 00:24.750
Cheryl and Ted are a thing.

00:24.751 --> 00:27.333
They went to Hawaii together.

00:27.334 --> 00:30.333
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:30.334 --> 00:33.792
- Jeez.
- So, this is really hard to look at.

00:33.793 --> 00:35.667
Yeah, well,
how do you think I feel?

00:35.668 --> 00:37.041
- You think I enjoy it?
- Okay.

00:37.042 --> 00:39.083
I never should've
done that show.

00:39.084 --> 00:40.500
That "Kimmel" show.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.249
God damn it.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.958
Hi, I'm the manager.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.583
There's been a delay
in your meals.

00:45.584 --> 00:47.124
I'm very sorry.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.291
There's been a disturbance
in the kitchen.

00:49.292 --> 00:50.833
But we're taking care of it.
Thanks.

00:50.834 --> 00:52.625
Well, what kind
of disturbance?

00:52.626 --> 00:55.792
A general disturbance.

00:55.793 --> 00:58.124
What's a general disturbance?

00:58.125 --> 01:01.708
Well, let's just say
it was a minor hiccup.

01:01.709 --> 01:03.917
Well, was it a hiccup
or a disturbance?

01:03.918 --> 01:05.625
It's such a small disturbance,

01:05.626 --> 01:07.958
it might be either one.

01:07.959 --> 01:09.375
What, it's like...
was the chef angry

01:09.376 --> 01:11.458
or did somebody drop
some pots and pans?

01:11.459 --> 01:12.159
What happened?

01:12.260 --> 01:14.999
Let's just say the
disturbance happened.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.792
Okay, that's a fact,

01:16.793 --> 01:18.875
and we're taking
care of it, okay?

01:18.876 --> 01:19.833
Are you listening to this?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.333
- Wait a second.
- I am.

01:21.334 --> 01:23.208
How come you won't tell me
what the disturbance was?

01:23.209 --> 01:25.708
Oh, well, that's
a very good question,

01:25.709 --> 01:27.500
- and I'm on top of it.
- Well, thank you.

01:27.501 --> 01:29.500
I'm glad you thought
it was a good question

01:29.501 --> 01:31.500
because it was a really
atrocious answer.

01:31.501 --> 01:34.500
- Well, I beg to differ.
- Let me ask you this question.

01:34.501 --> 01:36.667
How in God's name
did you get this job?

01:36.668 --> 01:40.082
I am great at dealing with
these disturbances.

01:40.083 --> 01:41.083
Yes, really?

01:41.084 --> 01:44.083
I'm asking that because you
come off as quite a goofball.

01:44.084 --> 01:46.166
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

01:46.167 --> 01:47.083
It's not.

01:47.084 --> 01:48.667
Delicious meal, by the way.

01:48.668 --> 01:51.667
Did I mention that?
Oh, gosh, I'm jealous.

01:51.668 --> 01:54.208
Is there any question
that you will answer?

01:54.209 --> 01:55.958
Because you haven't
answered one question yet.

01:55.959 --> 01:58.333
For example,
what color is your tie?

01:58.334 --> 02:00.208
- Let me just say this.
- Uh-huh.

02:00.209 --> 02:02.249
- I am wearing a tie.
- Yes, you are.

02:02.250 --> 02:06.041
- What color is it?
- I believe the tie is self-evident.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.541
So, the color is there.

02:08.542 --> 02:09.958
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

02:09.959 --> 02:12.875
- All right.
- Thank you.

02:14.542 --> 02:15.999
What the hell was that?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.416
Why wouldn't he tell me
what it was?

02:17.417 --> 02:19.458
- What's the big secret?
- I don't know.

02:19.459 --> 02:22.041
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- All right.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.667
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

02:41.668 --> 02:43.041
The restroom's down
the hallway.

02:43.042 --> 02:45.875
- Are you the chef?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

02:45.876 --> 02:48.625
Oh, okay...

02:48.626 --> 02:49.917
I was sitting at my table,

02:49.918 --> 02:51.083
the manager came over to us

02:51.084 --> 02:53.249
and said the food
was gonna be delayed

02:53.250 --> 02:55.583
because there was a
disturbance in the kitchen.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.208
Oh, yes, I'm sorry
about that, sir.

02:57.209 --> 02:59.291
There was a small
disturbance in the kitchen,

02:59.292 --> 03:01.416
but if you go have a seat, we'll
get your food right out to you.

03:01.417 --> 03:02.750
Yeah, I know, thanks.

03:02.751 --> 03:04.249
That's okay.
I mean, everything's fine.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.833
I was just wondering,

03:05.834 --> 03:07.833
you know,
what the disturbance was.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.708
Regular kitchen disturbance.

03:09.709 --> 03:11.333
They happen all the time.
Nothing to worry about.

03:11.334 --> 03:13.208
You mean somebody dropped
pots and pans or something?

03:13.209 --> 03:15.999
- Is that what happened?
- It's not that big of a deal, sir.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.249
It was a minor disturbance that
we have since taken care of.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.999
- Minor?
- It was perfectly minor.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.208
If it was, then my food would not
have been delayed by 15 minutes.

03:23.209 --> 03:26.667
- A slight delay in your food.
- It was more than a slight delay.

03:26.668 --> 03:28.750
- Sir. Sir.
- Tell the truth about the disturbance.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.333
It wasn't minor, it was major.

03:30.334 --> 03:32.208
What is this, an investigation?

03:32.209 --> 03:33.792
This is a kitchen, sir.

03:33.793 --> 03:35.958
I'm just trying to get some
food to some hungry people.

03:35.959 --> 03:38.458
That's all I wanna do.
And then I wanna go home.

03:38.459 --> 03:39.958
- Are you a married man?
- Yes.

03:39.959 --> 03:42.792
- Do you have children?
- Yes.

03:42.793 --> 03:45.541
All right, so you're having a wonderful
afternoon with the wife and kids,

03:45.542 --> 03:47.875
you go out to the post
office to get the mail.

03:47.876 --> 03:50.083
You come back, you hear a big
crash, you open the door,

03:50.084 --> 03:52.291
and your kids are sprawled out,
unconscious on the floor.

03:52.292 --> 03:54.458
You say to your wife,
"What happened?"

03:54.459 --> 03:56.667
And she goes, "Oh, there
was a disturbance."

03:56.668 --> 03:58.416
And you go, "What was
the disturbance?"

03:58.417 --> 04:01.291
She goes, "No, I don't wanna
tell you." How would you feel?

04:01.292 --> 04:03.224
I would want to know
what the disturbance was.

04:03.225 --> 04:04.625
That's exactly right!

04:04.626 --> 04:06.583
That's a very specific
situation, sir!

04:06.584 --> 04:11.333
You'd want to know what the
disturbance was, just like me!

04:11.334 --> 04:12.833
There's no children here!

04:12.834 --> 04:14.750
You're acting like a child.

04:14.751 --> 04:16.875
You're the child who's
keeping a little secret.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.208
- Yes.
- You got a little secret.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.791
- No, no, I'm the parent.
- Oh!

04:19.793 --> 04:22.041
I'm the parent who has to
worry about all the things.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.541
- I gotta worry about getting the food...
- No.

04:23.542 --> 04:25.917
...preparing the food,
and then giving it to you...

04:25.918 --> 04:30.124
No, you're the little baby who
won't tell Daddy what happened.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.875
- Please leave, sir.
- With pleasure.

04:33.876 --> 04:36.166
All right, fine.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.541
I'm coming! Bye.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.208
- We gotta go.
- What?

04:40.209 --> 04:44.166
Yeah, Susie's little sister
didn't come home last night.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.999
- Little sister?
- You know, she's part of that

04:46.000 --> 04:48.166
big sister, little sister
mentoring program.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.667
- Oh.
- The girl's staying with us,

04:49.668 --> 04:51.541
and she didn't come
home last night.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.276
- Can I help you with anything?
- No, we're good. We're leaving.

04:54.277 --> 04:56.999
That whole disturbance thing
threw us for a loop.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.708
Well, yeah,
I'm taking care of it.

04:58.709 --> 05:01.209
We're too disturbed
to eat right now.

05:03.626 --> 05:06.249
Wow, look at this thing.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.625
New Tesla.

05:07.626 --> 05:09.249
- Nice.
- Yeah.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.083
- Whose is it?
- Ted.

05:11.084 --> 05:12.708
Holy cow.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.249
She didn't come home. I don't
know where the hell she is.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.583
I've called everybody.
What can I do?

05:17.584 --> 05:21.541
- Oh, finally. Jeff, she's not back!
- I know, I'm sorry.

05:21.542 --> 05:22.832
Come here,
I wanna show you the tapes.

05:22.833 --> 05:23.833
Hi, Ted Danson.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.208
Yeah, it's me, asshole.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.875
Okay?
It's my fatwa disguise.

05:27.876 --> 05:30.708
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

05:30.709 --> 05:33.625
He was at the hotel.

05:33.626 --> 05:36.500
I'm sorry, were you just at a
hotel in the Marina, following us?

05:36.501 --> 05:38.917
- You were following us, weren't you?
- I was not following you.

05:38.918 --> 05:42.083
I was in the hotel.
That's where I was hiding.

05:42.084 --> 05:43.541
Why didn't you say hi?

05:43.542 --> 05:45.999
I was going to, but I had
to talk to the hotel manager

05:46.000 --> 05:47.416
about the pickle jar.

05:47.417 --> 05:49.166
- The pickle jar?
- The pickle jar.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.041
Yeah, everybody wants
to open a pickle jar.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.375
- Don't you wanna open a pickle jar?
- Okay.

05:53.376 --> 05:55.349
Could you get me some
sparkling water, please?

05:55.350 --> 05:56.550
Yes.

05:56.751 --> 05:58.999
Oh, and T, can you get
a lemon with that, please?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.625
T? Oh, "T"?

06:01.626 --> 06:05.041
- What is that? It's unseemly.
- It's short for Ted.

06:05.042 --> 06:06.708
You never gave me
any little nicknames.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.917
Could've called me L.
You didn't call me L.

06:08.918 --> 06:10.416
You didn't call me D.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.291
You could've
called me "Elvid."

06:12.292 --> 06:14.208
- I'm sorry, "Elvid"?
- Yeah, "Elvid."

06:14.209 --> 06:15.999
- As a term of endearment?
- Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.458
Like, "Let's spoon, Elvid"?

06:18.459 --> 06:20.124
- Yeah, "Elvid."
- Okay.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.667
You know what? Enough with
this bullshit, all right?

06:21.668 --> 06:23.625
Enough with the nicknames.
Nobody gives a shit.

06:23.626 --> 06:26.124
We're looking for my little
sister. We have to find her.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.833
She's 15.
How do you know she's gone?

06:27.834 --> 06:29.500
She's probably
at her boyfriend's house.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.249
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

06:31.250 --> 06:35.041
This kid, Larry, oh!
She is so talented.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.916
You think Sammi was
talented at her age?

06:36.917 --> 06:37.917
No, I don't.

06:37.918 --> 06:39.249
Oh, stop it! Look at this.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.124
Look at this tape.
Look at that dancing.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.291
Huh? Is that amaz...
look at her, oh.

06:43.292 --> 06:44.917
Got attitude.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.291
It's wonderful.
Okay, I've seen plenty.

06:46.292 --> 06:47.291
Thank you, I got it.

06:47.292 --> 06:48.500
I get it. I got it.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.124
What do you get?
You don't get shit.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.375
- I got it.
- All right, we gotta find the kid!

06:52.376 --> 06:53.499
What, do you want me to watch
the whole dance recital?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.750
Yes, I do, all right?

06:54.751 --> 06:56.874
We're gonna form a search
party and find her.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.875
A search party?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.291
What are we, in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, in 1870?

07:00.292 --> 07:01.750
Find her! Let's go.

07:01.751 --> 07:03.166
- Everybody, split up.
- Yes.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.041
Let's go. Split up.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.458
I thought you were
okay with this.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.583
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, do me a favor.

07:08.584 --> 07:09.333
Yeah.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.333
Can I look for the kid
in your Tesla?

07:11.334 --> 07:12.458
I'd like to drive it.

07:12.459 --> 07:14.333
- All right, okay.
- Thanks, T.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.958
Come on.

07:37.376 --> 07:38.542
What?

07:40.751 --> 07:43.166
- What?
- I don't appreciate that beep, sir.

07:43.167 --> 07:46.208
Oh, well, you know,
the light had turned green

07:46.209 --> 07:47.708
and I gave you time.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.416
You must've drifted off
or something.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.375
- No, I didn't drift.
- Were you daydreaming?

07:51.376 --> 07:54.041
No, I was doing important
police business.

07:54.042 --> 07:56.208
Well, with all due respect,
a green light is not the time

07:56.209 --> 07:57.875
to be doing police business.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.625
Sir, I don't appreciate

07:59.626 --> 08:01.083
the aggressiveness of the beep.

08:01.084 --> 08:02.667
Oh, yeah, well, you know what?

08:02.668 --> 08:05.500
This is my friend's car
and I'm not really attuned

08:05.501 --> 08:08.041
to the subtleties
of the horn yet.

08:08.042 --> 08:11.583
It was merely just a reminder beep,
a subtle way of telling you,

08:11.584 --> 08:13.041
"Time to go.

08:13.042 --> 08:15.541
Let's get moving. Move it on."

08:15.542 --> 08:17.375
License and registration,
please.

08:17.376 --> 08:19.416
- I'm gonna write you a ticket.
- A ticket?

08:19.417 --> 08:22.041
It was a bad decision on your
part to honk at a police officer.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.708
Oh, what... why?
Are you above the beep?

08:23.709 --> 08:25.999
Absolutely. I'm a police officer.
I protect your rights.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.667
My rights to beep.

08:27.668 --> 08:29.291
- That's one of my rights.
- Yeah, but you don't...

08:29.292 --> 08:30.667
Beeping, that's a right.

08:30.668 --> 08:32.541
That's America.
We're allowed to beep.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.124
Yeah? Well, I'm allowed
to write this ticket.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.750
Good. Write it.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.166
You getting smart with me, boy?

08:37.167 --> 08:39.582
I'm not getting smart.
I am smart, by the way.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.999
- I'm smart.
- Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.082
And of course I'll be
protesting this ticket.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.917
I hope you enjoy
your day in court.

08:45.918 --> 08:48.917
Here you go. Have a nice day.

08:48.918 --> 08:50.541
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:50.542 --> 08:53.458
You made my day.
No one's above the beep.

08:53.459 --> 08:55.875
No one!

09:04.793 --> 09:06.792
- Mm.
- They're not coming.

09:06.793 --> 09:07.626
No.

09:09.334 --> 09:12.291
- They're not coming.
- No.

09:12.292 --> 09:15.750
Not even a text.

09:15.751 --> 09:17.958
You know why? They're afraid
to be on the text chain.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.416
- Yep.
- 'Cause of the fatwa.

09:19.417 --> 09:20.999
Mm-hmm.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.083
That's fucked up.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.875
They are really showing
their true colors.

09:25.876 --> 09:27.291
They don't have no colors.

09:27.292 --> 09:29.458
They're white.
There's no fucking color.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.291
I should just have
over black friends.

09:31.292 --> 09:34.249
If you want, I'll go over
there and fuck somebody ass up.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.792
I'll take Swat over there.

09:35.793 --> 09:37.792
I seen Swat kick
a motherfucker one night

09:37.793 --> 09:40.667
and broke his fucking
back like this.

09:40.668 --> 09:43.124
He turned that motherfucker
into a human wallet.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.375
What did the guy do?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.500
Motherfucker
started mumbling.

09:46.501 --> 09:48.500
The one thing
you don't wanna do

09:48.501 --> 09:51.291
around Swat is to speak
under your breath.

09:51.292 --> 09:54.500
I can't mumble at all?
I like to mumble.

09:54.501 --> 09:56.333
Don't mumble about him.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.500
Hey, let me ask
you a question.

09:57.501 --> 09:59.667
Have you seen my sunglasses?

09:59.668 --> 10:01.583
My... you know,
my Dr. Strangelove sunglasses?

10:01.584 --> 10:03.833
I know what you're talking about,
but, no, I haven't seen them.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.500
I've been looking all over
for them. I love those glasses.

10:08.292 --> 10:09.500
Swat, God damn!

10:09.501 --> 10:11.083
What the fuck's
going on in there, man?

10:11.084 --> 10:13.416
I'm cooking, man.
Nothing going on. Just cooking.

10:13.417 --> 10:14.833
You're causing
a fucking disturbance.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.667
Yeah, yeah, you're
making a disturbance.

10:16.668 --> 10:18.958
This ain't no disturbance.
I'm cooking chicken spaghetti.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.375
No, it's not up to you to say
whether it's a disturbance or not.

10:21.376 --> 10:23.917
We're the ones being disturbed.
It's our call.

10:23.918 --> 10:26.375
Yeah. No, he wasn't making
a fucking disturbance, was he?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.958
- That's not a disturbance.
- What the fuck you say?

10:28.959 --> 10:32.625
Oh... no, it's his turn
to deal.

10:32.626 --> 10:34.375
We're playing War.

10:34.376 --> 10:37.375
We're playing cards.

10:37.376 --> 10:40.541
I just fucking told you,
don't talk under your breath.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.792
You wanna get fucked up?

10:42.793 --> 10:46.458
Okay, well, this is
the coup de grâce.

10:46.459 --> 10:50.333
They canceled golf
on Saturday.

10:50.334 --> 10:53.291
Oh, man, I can't live
like this anymore.

10:53.292 --> 10:54.584
I just can't.

10:57.959 --> 11:00.376
There's only one man
who could help me.

11:10.084 --> 11:12.416
- Yes?
- Yeah, it's Larry David.

11:19.584 --> 11:20.917
- Mr. David?
- Yes, sir.

11:20.918 --> 11:24.249
We've been expecting you.
Please come in.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.876
Okay.

11:30.209 --> 11:31.918
And if you'd follow me.

11:34.959 --> 11:36.250
This way.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.583
Mr. David is here now, sir.

11:43.584 --> 11:47.166
Oh, Mr. David, come in.
Please have a seat.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.500
Thank you. Thank you for
seeing me, Mr. Rushdie.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.416
- No, call me Salman.
- It's not "Salmon"?

11:52.417 --> 11:53.483
"Saul-mahn."

11:53.484 --> 11:56.083
Salman? There's an accent
on the second syllable.

11:56.084 --> 11:59.124
Exactly. Now, tell me
why you're here.

11:59.125 --> 12:02.958
Oh, well, I'm sure you, uh...
you've heard about...

12:02.959 --> 12:04.208
Yeah, I heard
about your problem.

12:04.209 --> 12:05.958
And I thought
if there's anybody

12:05.959 --> 12:08.750
who could understand what
I'm going through, it's you.

12:08.751 --> 12:10.792
And to tell you the truth,
I'm at my wit's end.

12:10.793 --> 12:14.041
Let me tell you something.
It took me a long time.

12:14.042 --> 12:16.708
It took me maybe several years

12:16.709 --> 12:19.500
to get to the point that I'm
going to talk to you about now.

12:19.501 --> 12:21.041
I want to give you a shortcut,

12:21.042 --> 12:23.625
which is that, yeah,
it is all those things.

12:23.626 --> 12:27.041
It can be scary, it can be
bewildering, et cetera.

12:27.042 --> 12:30.333
But there are things
that you gain.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.875
There are a lot of women

12:31.876 --> 12:35.792
who are attracted to you
in this condition.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.833
Really? I didn't think
there was any condition

12:37.834 --> 12:40.376
- that they'd be attracted to me.
- You are a dangerous man.

12:41.626 --> 12:43.583
There are very beautiful women

12:43.584 --> 12:45.208
who like that.

12:45.209 --> 12:46.917
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.416
Even with me they would like it?

12:48.417 --> 12:49.833
It's not exactly you;

12:49.834 --> 12:52.708
it's the fatwa
wrapped around you.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.500
Like kind of sexy pixie dust.

12:54.501 --> 12:55.333
Huh!

12:55.334 --> 12:58.333
But you have to stop
acting like a wuss.

12:58.334 --> 13:02.208
I mean, look at you. You look
like a person trying to hide.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.416
- That's exactly right.
- That is not sexy.

13:04.417 --> 13:09.083
Be a man, stop this,
and fatwa sex will follow.

13:09.084 --> 13:12.792
- Fatwa sex?
- The best sex there is.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.708
- Wow!
- Yes.

13:14.709 --> 13:17.083
What about the fatwa itself?
I don't...

13:17.084 --> 13:19.833
You know, you've survived
many, many years now.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.625
Well, it's, you know...
it's there.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.541
- Yeah.
- But fuck it.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.750
Mm, yeah, the
"fuck it" philosophy.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.917
It's a tough one.
I've tried it with orthotics.

13:27.918 --> 13:29.708
It didn't really
work very well.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.375
No, no, you're... look,
you're being pathetic.

13:31.376 --> 13:33.375
- Let me help you.
- What?

13:33.376 --> 13:35.875
There. Now, look,
there you are.

13:35.876 --> 13:38.166
You're a man of danger.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.792
The fatwa sex is beginning
to circle around you,

13:41.793 --> 13:43.249
so be a man now.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.249
Let's go out,
get a bite to eat.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.501
Trust me.

13:50.042 --> 13:51.875
Let's eat!

13:51.876 --> 13:55.249
That's my boy.

13:56.918 --> 13:58.625
Hello. Table for two, please.

13:58.626 --> 14:01.083
Of course, Mr. Rushdie.
Hello, Mr. David.

14:08.793 --> 14:11.708
Turn around, turn around.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.625
- Look.
- Oh. It's him.

14:13.626 --> 14:15.250
Oh, my God.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.667
And your server will be
right with you guys.

14:21.668 --> 14:23.833
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.875
Okay, so, you see?
It's not so bad.

14:26.876 --> 14:30.541
Yeah, I'm in a restaurant
having... having lunch.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.708
You're not behind
some stupid mask.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.750
You can go in a supermarket,
go to a ball game.

14:35.751 --> 14:39.083
- You'll be a person.
- You know what?

14:39.084 --> 14:40.458
I'm feeling a lot
better about things.

14:40.459 --> 14:41.792
Now, tell me something.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.917
This musical,
it's about me, right?

14:43.918 --> 14:46.708
- Yes.
- So, I mean, I'm interested.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.333
Who have you got playing me?

14:48.334 --> 14:51.708
Oh, well, of course, now,
because of this whole fatwa thing,

14:51.709 --> 14:53.124
it's probably not gonna happen.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.291
But the guy I had in mind

14:55.292 --> 14:59.249
was actually Jason Alexander.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.958
You mean, like,
"George" Jason Alexander?

15:01.959 --> 15:04.291
No, you know, that was just
a character that he played.

15:04.292 --> 15:06.875
- Ja... you know...
- There's no remote resemblance.

15:06.876 --> 15:09.792
I mean, he's short.
He's a lot shorter than me.

15:09.793 --> 15:11.583
He's not... a lot shorter?
What?

15:11.584 --> 15:14.124
- He's not that much shorter.
- Inches.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.083
Hmm. Well, who are you
thinking about?

15:16.084 --> 15:18.083
I'm thinking about,
you know, Hugh Jackman.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.291
- That's good.
- Hugh Jackman?

15:20.292 --> 15:23.166
- Yeah, he's a triple threat.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

15:23.167 --> 15:24.999
He can sing,
he can dance, he can act.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.583
- Yeah.
- He could totally play me.

15:26.584 --> 15:29.083
I think you're delusional.
Anyway, it's all moot.

15:29.084 --> 15:31.166
What's the difference, you know?
It's not gonna happen.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.458
All right, well,
that's a relief.

15:32.459 --> 15:33.583
It's too bad, too,

15:33.584 --> 15:35.667
because what you said
about fatwa sex?

15:35.668 --> 15:36.917
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

15:36.918 --> 15:38.667
I would've put that
right in the show.

15:38.668 --> 15:41.708
- That is so perfect.
- But that is not the only benefit.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.500
For example, you don't
have to go to anything

15:44.501 --> 15:45.833
you don't want to go to.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.625
- Hmm.
- So, like, your cousin

15:47.626 --> 15:51.833
is giving a reading
of his lousy poetry book,

15:51.834 --> 15:53.875
and you say,
"Sorry, can't make it.

15:53.876 --> 15:55.625
- Fatwa."
- Fatwa.

15:55.626 --> 15:58.458
Somebody calls you, says,
"Can you come pick me up at the airport?"

15:58.459 --> 16:00.999
You say, "Can't make it.
Fatwa. Can't make it."

16:01.000 --> 16:02.999
This is a fatwa
"Life of Riley."

16:03.000 --> 16:05.917
- Yeah, with added death threats.
- With the death threats, yeah.

16:05.918 --> 16:09.625
You know what's happening?
I'm feeling, uh, pretty good.

16:09.626 --> 16:11.917
Pretty, pretty good.

16:11.918 --> 16:14.584
Compliments of the lady.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.208
Oh, my God.

16:21.209 --> 16:24.458
- You know who that is?
- That's Elizabeth Banks, my friend.

16:24.459 --> 16:26.124
She sent you a drink.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.833
This is what
I'm talking about.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.542
Here it is, right here.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.708
Salman, this is...
this is unbelievable.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.875
So don't talk to me.
What are you talking to me for?

16:35.876 --> 16:38.041
Go talk to her.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.042
Do this. Go for it.

16:47.709 --> 16:48.917
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:48.918 --> 16:51.166
Cheers. May I join you?

16:51.167 --> 16:53.875
- Yes.
- Although, I should warn you

16:53.876 --> 16:57.124
that it might be...
it might be a bit dangerous.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.792
- Really? Tell us all about that.
- Yes.

16:58.793 --> 17:02.249
- Is that Salman Rushdie?
- Yes, that's Salman.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.583
We're the, uh...
we're the fatwa boys.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.999
I just can't believe
you're out and about.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.290
- In broad daylight.
- What am I gonna do, Elizabeth?

17:10.291 --> 17:13.750
Look, I'm not gonna walk around
with a mustache and a wig.

17:13.751 --> 17:15.916
- Right?
- Yes, you just face the world.

17:15.917 --> 17:16.916
Absolutely!

17:16.917 --> 17:18.708
Hello, ladies, I'm the manager.

17:18.709 --> 17:22.083
I really apologize about
your lunch being late.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.249
There was a disturbance
in the kitchen.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.666
- Ah. What kind of disturbance?
- He's not gonna tell you.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.958
- I am about to tell her.
- Yeah, sure, go ahead.

17:28.959 --> 17:31.124
Yes, we have a very big kitchen,

17:31.125 --> 17:32.875
and we're moving forward now,

17:32.876 --> 17:35.083
and we're going to get
your meal right away.

17:35.084 --> 17:36.058
Can't wait.

17:36.059 --> 17:38.458
He hasn't told you one thing
about the disturbance, has he?

17:38.459 --> 17:40.291
He hasn't... you didn't tell
her about the disturbance,

17:40.292 --> 17:41.625
- just like last time.
- I believe I did.

17:41.626 --> 17:43.291
I've ticked all the boxes...

17:43.292 --> 17:45.041
- You didn't tick one box.
- ...of the disturbance.

17:45.042 --> 17:47.291
You didn't tick a box.
The boxes are empty.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.458
I beg to differ.

17:48.459 --> 17:50.291
Let's get on to that
delicious lunch.

17:50.292 --> 17:52.208
All right, thank you.

17:52.209 --> 17:54.416
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's okay.

17:54.417 --> 17:57.626
I wanna know everything there
is to know about Larry David.

18:04.376 --> 18:07.500
- To the fatwa boys.
- To the fatwa boys.

18:09.042 --> 18:11.500
He completely changed my
outlook on this whole thing.

18:11.501 --> 18:12.999
At the end of the conversation,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.166
he got up, he ripped off my wig,

18:15.167 --> 18:17.667
and said, "Come on,
we're going out to lunch."

18:17.668 --> 18:19.291
- Unbelievable!
- Welcome. Welcome back.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.833
- Look at you, you're back to normal.
- Yeah.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.958
- Yes.
- I like the other look better.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.999
Ooh, you know what?
She's better every day.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.416
Pretty good. Anyway, Elizabeth
Banks sent a drink to my table.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.792
Oh, my God, I love her.

18:30.793 --> 18:32.833
- Oh, she's fantastic.
- She's fantastic.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.875
- I know. I went over to her table.
- Oh, bullshit.

18:35.876 --> 18:39.166
We had a lovely conversation,
and I saw her last night.

18:39.167 --> 18:42.458
- She's not interested in you, Larry.
- She's swooning.

18:42.459 --> 18:44.249
- She's swooning?
- She's swooning over me.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.875
- You're delusional.
- Do you know why?

18:45.876 --> 18:47.667
- Because I'm dangerous, Susie.
- Yeah.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.333
What the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

18:49.334 --> 18:51.375
I think I might've left
my sunglasses here.

18:51.376 --> 18:53.208
You know, the Dr. Strangelove
glasses?

18:53.209 --> 18:54.541
Yeah, would you mind
looking for them?

18:54.542 --> 18:55.875
Yeah, I would mind
looking for them.

18:55.876 --> 18:57.708
I'm busy looking
for a little girl.

18:57.709 --> 19:00.041
All right, well,
when you're outside,

19:00.042 --> 19:02.458
you look for Katie,
and when you're inside,

19:02.459 --> 19:05.458
eh... you look
for the sunglasses.

19:05.459 --> 19:07.708
You could do both.
It's like Jeff's Cubs hat.

19:07.709 --> 19:08.833
Have you found
your Cubs hat?

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
No, I have not.

19:10.209 --> 19:11.875
I'm sure if you ran across
Jeff's Cubs hat,

19:11.876 --> 19:13.124
you would call it
to his attention.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.667
Same thing with
the sunglasses.

19:14.668 --> 19:16.533
That's all I'm asking.

19:16.534 --> 19:17.933
- Excuse me. I don't give a shit
- ...that's all.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.040
about Jeff's Cubs hat...

19:19.042 --> 19:21.500
...about your
Dr. Strangelove glasses.

19:21.501 --> 19:23.875
I care about this kid,
my little sister.

19:23.876 --> 19:26.166
Just keep it in the
back of your mind.

19:26.167 --> 19:29.541
Look, I've got Katie
in the back of my mind.

19:29.542 --> 19:32.833
I've got the sunglasses up front,
Katie's in the back.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.792
- That's so wrong, Larry.
- But it's always in the back.

19:34.793 --> 19:36.708
Katie should be in the
front for both of you.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.750
She's not an inanimate object.

19:38.751 --> 19:41.124
Okay, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do for you.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.917
I'm gonna move Katie all
the way up to the front.

19:43.918 --> 19:46.291
I'm gonna give her equal
footing with the sunglasses.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.667
Both in front of my mind.

19:47.668 --> 19:49.750
Where's my Cubs hat
in this scenario?

19:49.751 --> 19:51.999
I can't handle
three in the front.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.291
It's too much. It's overload.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.416
I'll move Katie
back two paces.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.792
I'm gonna move your
Cubs hat to the front.

19:58.793 --> 19:59.958
That works perfect.

19:59.959 --> 20:02.291
You two have no compassion,

20:02.292 --> 20:04.917
have no caring about
another human being.

20:04.918 --> 20:06.583
There's some partial
truth to that.

20:06.584 --> 20:08.958
- Yeah.
- It's an illness, for sure.

20:08.959 --> 20:12.249
I don't know why I have it,
but I... I definitely do.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.041
Maybe that's her.

20:14.042 --> 20:16.249
- This is fucking nuts.
- Oh, Ted!

20:16.250 --> 20:18.083
She's still gone.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.083
- No, she's still gone.
- You're living the life now.

20:20.084 --> 20:21.583
- Oh, my God, I love her.
- Bless your heart.

20:21.584 --> 20:22.833
- You poor thing.
- By the way,

20:22.834 --> 20:24.625
that car of yours
got me a ticket.

20:24.626 --> 20:25.525
How?

20:25.526 --> 20:29.625
I was at a stoplight
and I beeped a cop.

20:29.626 --> 20:31.541
What's that have to do
with my car?

20:31.542 --> 20:34.875
Because your horn cannot hit the subtle
notes required in the art of beeping.

20:34.876 --> 20:37.124
- A beep's a beep.
- A beep is not a beep.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.625
I'm telling you, that horn is
gonna get you in a lot of trouble.

20:39.626 --> 20:40.750
Mark my words.

20:40.751 --> 20:42.083
So, how much is a beep ticket?

20:42.084 --> 20:43.249
$275.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.583
Wow. Are you gonna pay it?

20:44.584 --> 20:46.834
No. I'm fighting it.

20:49.209 --> 20:50.458
I mean, Your Honor,

20:50.459 --> 20:51.999
I don't even know why I'm here.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.999
There should be no such
thing as a ticket for this.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.333
It's our inalienable
right to beep.

20:56.334 --> 20:58.583
Without the freedom to beep,

20:58.584 --> 21:01.458
we are no better than
the beasts in the field.

21:01.459 --> 21:03.999
And I'm not talking
about the common chicken.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.875
I'm talking about the mighty
oxen and the donkey...

21:06.876 --> 21:08.708
- Donkey.
- ...with his floppy ears,

21:08.709 --> 21:13.375
...his pea-brain and his stolid,
slack-jawed gaze.

21:13.376 --> 21:16.500
A revolting creature,
if there ever was one...

21:16.501 --> 21:18.833
- O-okay. Okay, all right.
- ...who walked the earth!

21:18.834 --> 21:21.917
That's enough of that talk about
donkeys and field chickens.

21:21.918 --> 21:23.583
I've got more
about the donkeys...

21:23.584 --> 21:24.958
That's enough.

21:24.959 --> 21:27.583
All right,
so, Officer Jenkins,

21:27.584 --> 21:29.541
you have been in this
courtroom many times.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.291
How many of those cases
has been because

21:31.292 --> 21:34.458
someone has beeped you?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.124
Never, Your Honor.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.208
- Not once.
- A feather in my cap.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.917
I'm a first to beep a cop.

21:39.918 --> 21:41.792
I'm a pioneer, Your Honor.

21:41.793 --> 21:43.833
In the mold of a Rosa Parks.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.416
- Wow. Huh.
- In the mold of a Jackie Robinson.

21:46.417 --> 21:49.166
Mm-hmm. Anyone else
you're in the mold of?

21:49.167 --> 21:52.750
Maybe a Martin Luther King
or a Malcolm X?

21:52.751 --> 21:53.999
Harriet Tubman?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.416
Yes, Harriet Tubman.

21:55.417 --> 21:57.124
Although I'm not quite sure
what she did,

21:57.125 --> 21:59.625
I have a feeling she was
in the pioneer family.

21:59.626 --> 22:00.958
All right,
so do you think that...

22:00.959 --> 22:02.583
I'm sorry, could you
just take a step back?

22:02.584 --> 22:05.208
- You're in the well right now.
- Oh, am I in the well?

22:05.209 --> 22:08.541
- Yeah, that would be called a well.
- Oh, sorry.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.583
Somebody could've told me
about the well, frankly.

22:10.584 --> 22:12.458
I was talking
to you outside.

22:12.459 --> 22:14.333
You never mentioned anything.
Wouldn't have killed you.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.333
I think we need to get back
to you beeping right now.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.875
Your Honor, may I offer
you a cough drop?

22:19.876 --> 22:21.750
You know, you're a judge,
you're talking a lot,

22:21.751 --> 22:23.375
there are people here
all the time.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.833
You get a sore throat.
Take it.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.416
- Take the cough drop.
- I don't need any.

22:26.417 --> 22:27.750
- Take it for later.
- Yeah, all right.

22:27.751 --> 22:29.416
- Okay? Yeah.
- Thank you for your...

22:29.417 --> 22:31.291
- your warm pocket candy.
- You'll thank me.

22:31.292 --> 22:32.124
Yeah.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.124
You'll be sucking on
that thing, going...

22:33.125 --> 22:34.750
"Boy, that guy in court today

22:34.751 --> 22:36.375
really had something
with that cough drop."

22:36.376 --> 22:39.583
The chances of me putting that
in my mouth are very slim.

22:39.584 --> 22:42.416
Well, if you're not gonna suck on it,
you might as well return it.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.500
I mean what's the point of
taking a coughdrop

22:44.501 --> 22:47.957
from somebody if you're not gonna
suck on it? ...Cause I'll use it.

22:47.958 --> 22:49.958
That may be the first thing
that we've agreed on today.

22:49.959 --> 22:52.708
Now take your unsucked candy
and get back to your desk.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.917
Okay, let the record show I
had a good time in the well.

22:54.918 --> 22:56.792
- Hmm.
- That's all I'm gonna say about it.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.291
Love the well.

22:58.292 --> 23:01.249
- I'm so glad I came.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.708
- Yeah, I'm really glad, too.
- This is not going the way you wanted it.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.500
Your Honor, are you listening to
what this man is saying over here?

23:07.501 --> 23:10.292
Huh? Did you listen
to one word... yoo-hoo.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.458
Mr. David, did you just...

23:13.459 --> 23:14.917
did you just yoo-hoo me?

23:14.918 --> 23:16.833
I did. I yoo-hooed you.

23:16.834 --> 23:18.792
You weren't paying attention,
so I yoo-hooed.

23:18.793 --> 23:21.041
Right, so you decided
it was okay to yoo-hoo.

23:21.042 --> 23:23.041
Oh, you can't
yoo-hoo a judge?

23:23.042 --> 23:27.208
You most certainly cannot
yoo-hoo a judge.

23:27.209 --> 23:29.125
I'm affirming the citation.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.124
Very well.
I will pay your citation.

23:34.125 --> 23:35.792
But I cannot leave
this courtroom

23:35.793 --> 23:38.833
without telling you that a grave
injustice has been done here,

23:38.834 --> 23:41.041
for I'm not doing this for me;

23:41.042 --> 23:42.917
I did it for you
and you and you.

23:42.918 --> 23:44.583
- Bailiff.
- And all of you.

23:44.584 --> 23:46.333
For we are not donkeys.

23:46.334 --> 23:48.833
Or in Brooklyn, we would say...

23:48.834 --> 23:51.500
we would say "dunkeys"
for some reason. "Dunkeys."

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Hey, come on, buddy.

24:09.668 --> 24:13.667
Oh, jeez, that is...
that is loud.

24:13.668 --> 24:15.541
Oh, no. No, no, come on.

24:15.542 --> 24:18.041
No, no, I... I'm sorry.

24:18.042 --> 24:19.249
- Sorry.
- Roll down the window.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.958
That was just a reminder beep.

24:22.626 --> 24:25.375
That was just a reminder beep.
I'm sorry.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.041
Reminder beep?
Reminder for what?

24:27.042 --> 24:28.792
Well, but the light
had changed and...

24:28.793 --> 24:30.708
No, no, that was
an aggressive fucking beep.

24:30.709 --> 24:32.416
It's a new car
and I'm not used

24:32.417 --> 24:33.875
to the subtleties
of the beeps.

24:33.876 --> 24:35.375
No, I don't give a shit.
Come here. Get out here.

24:35.376 --> 24:36.958
Wait, wait, wait!
It's me, Ted Danson.

24:36.959 --> 24:39.542
"Becker," "Cheers,"
anything? Jesus.

24:41.209 --> 24:42.875
- Hi, Lar.
- Oh, hello.

24:42.876 --> 24:46.375
- Oh.
- This is my friend, Elizabeth.

24:46.376 --> 24:47.917
- Hi!
- Hello, Elizabeth.

24:47.918 --> 24:49.667
- Elizabeth Banks.
- Yes!

24:49.668 --> 24:51.166
- Hi.
- This is Susie Greene.

24:51.167 --> 24:53.333
Hi. Oh, what a beautiful
house this is.

24:53.334 --> 24:54.750
Hi, Jeff.
This is Elizabeth Banks.

24:54.751 --> 24:56.708
- So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

24:56.709 --> 24:58.875
- Nice to meet you.
- The man behind the man.

24:58.876 --> 24:59.541
I get it.

24:59.542 --> 25:01.541
Why don't you come inside,
all right?

25:01.542 --> 25:04.583
Okay, okay.
We'll go inside.

25:04.584 --> 25:05.524
Thank you, Elizabeth.

25:05.525 --> 25:07.124
You know, we were just
in the neighborhood

25:07.125 --> 25:08.541
having a little drive.

25:08.542 --> 25:11.249
I heard about
your little sister.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.166
- Yeah. Oh, you did? Yeah.
- It's terrible.

25:13.167 --> 25:16.875
I lost a cat once,
so I know how you're feeling.

25:16.876 --> 25:19.917
With all due respect,
losing a cat

25:19.918 --> 25:21.583
is nothing like
losing a child.

25:21.584 --> 25:23.917
Well, with all due respect,

25:23.918 --> 25:25.999
I mean, that cat was my child.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.249
And this girl, I mean, it sounds
like you kind of barely know her.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.124
I would say I know
her quite well.

25:31.125 --> 25:33.875
She's an underprivileged child
we took into our home,

25:33.876 --> 25:36.375
and she feels like
our own little girl.

25:36.376 --> 25:38.958
Well, Mr. Noodle
was a stray as well,

25:38.959 --> 25:40.708
who I brought in
off the street,

25:40.709 --> 25:43.875
and literally slept on
my bosom for 17 years.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.416
Mr. Noodle slept
on your bosom?

25:45.417 --> 25:47.124
- Yeah, he did.
- Yeah.

25:47.125 --> 25:50.166
- He was a stray?
- I know how much you miss this girl.

25:50.167 --> 25:52.583
It's... it's a loss,
for sure.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.167
It's a huge loss,
and she's a human being.

25:54.567 --> 25:55.067
Yeah.

25:55.068 --> 25:57.166
- Flesh and blood.
- Not your flesh and blood.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.633
Not my flesh and blood..

25:58.634 --> 26:00.333
- ..but I don't discriminate.
- No. Someone else's.

26:00.334 --> 26:02.917
I'm happy to tweet
a recent photo of her.

26:02.918 --> 26:04.458
I do have a lot of followers.

26:04.459 --> 26:06.375
I have a video of her dancing.

26:06.376 --> 26:08.291
She's a very talented dancer.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.917
Oh, we should put that on my
social channels or something.

26:10.918 --> 26:12.625
I saw her dance. She's not...
she's not much of a dancer.

26:12.626 --> 26:14.458
Oh, what the fuck
do you know, Larry?

26:14.459 --> 26:16.208
- I saw the tape.
- You know talent? You know dancing?

26:16.209 --> 26:18.333
I saw the tape of the dancing.
I don't wanna get into it.

26:18.334 --> 26:19.833
What was the last dance
program you ever saw?

26:19.834 --> 26:21.625
Did you go to
Martha Graham? No.

26:21.626 --> 26:24.917
Yeah, because I don't like to
go out of my way to be bored.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.667
I could show Elizabeth
right now

26:26.668 --> 26:29.583
a video of her dancing,
which is magnificent.

26:29.584 --> 26:32.249
I'll watch that video
and you can watch

26:32.250 --> 26:34.083
a video of Mr. Noodle
chasing a string.

26:34.084 --> 26:36.375
- All right, enough!
- It is the cutest thing you ever saw.

26:36.376 --> 26:38.541
This is a underprivileged child...

26:38.542 --> 26:40.667
- Oh.
- ...who came into our world.

26:40.668 --> 26:42.541
Look, I just wanna
be helpful, you know?

26:42.542 --> 26:44.875
Elvid told me
about the situation and...

26:44.876 --> 26:46.500
- Who?
- Oh, El...

26:46.501 --> 26:48.249
- She calls me Elvid.
- It's my little...

26:48.250 --> 26:49.833
Why the fuck do you
call him "Elvid"?

26:49.834 --> 26:51.291
- It's my little nickname.
- Nickname.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.958
You know? I like to have...
he calls me Lizzie,

26:52.959 --> 26:54.999
- I call him Elvid.
- Oh, Jesus.

26:56.626 --> 26:57.750
Oh, wait a minute.

26:57.751 --> 26:59.500
A cop car just pulled up, Jeff.

26:59.501 --> 27:00.376
What is that?

27:02.209 --> 27:04.124
Oh, my God, Jeff!

27:04.125 --> 27:06.917
- My little sister!
- I'm really sorry.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.458
- Oh, my God!
- My glasses!

27:10.459 --> 27:11.999
My glasses!

27:31.668 --> 27:34.333
I'm so happy to have you back.

27:34.334 --> 27:35.958
Where'd you find her,
Officer?

27:35.959 --> 27:37.541
- She was at her boyfriend's.
- No, she wasn't.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.749
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Come on.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.208
- All right.
- You come in. We'll discuss it.

27:41.209 --> 27:44.041
- Bite to eat?
- Love it. Starving.

27:44.042 --> 27:45.876
- Let's do it.
- Great.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.541
That's Jeff's Cubs hat.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.083
You gotta call
the fire department.

27:53.084 --> 27:54.625
The fire department?

27:54.626 --> 27:56.875
That's very dangerous,
Elvid.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.542
I got this, Lizzie.

28:02.084 --> 28:04.041
Wow, Elvid.

28:04.042 --> 28:05.918
Is there nothing
you're afraid of?

28:11.376 --> 28:14.626
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes!

28:19.542 --> 28:22.124
Oh.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.250
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Okay.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.458
You have an...
an idea for an app?

28:33.459 --> 28:34.875
It's a fantastic idea.

28:34.876 --> 28:36.625
Say I invite you over
for dinner one night.

28:36.626 --> 28:38.291
Okay, I like where
this is going.

28:39.292 --> 28:40.416
And I'm cooking...

28:40.417 --> 28:41.816
- And then?
- I've never done this in my life,

28:41.817 --> 28:43.917
...by the way, but I'm...
it's just all hypothetical.

28:43.918 --> 28:47.249
- I like it.
- So, now when dinner's over,

28:47.250 --> 28:49.924
okay, and there's a big pile
of dishes in the kitchen.

28:49.925 --> 28:50.625
Sure.

28:50.626 --> 28:52.458
We don't wanna deal with that,
right?

28:52.459 --> 28:54.333
Wait till tomorrow.
We've got other things to do.

28:54.334 --> 28:55.875
No, we don't even need
to wait till tomorrow.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.291
- Why?
- I pick up the phone,

28:57.292 --> 28:59.458
I open up the app,
five minutes later,

28:59.459 --> 29:01.291
there's people
doing the dishes.

29:01.292 --> 29:03.708
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a suspect.

29:03.709 --> 29:06.291
He vandalized police property.
Larry David.

29:06.292 --> 29:07.958
Hi, I'm the restaurant
manager.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.249
How may I help you?

29:09.250 --> 29:11.291
Yes, I'm looking
for Larry David.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.999
- Ah, yes, Larry David.
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.166
He's one of our more
engaging customers.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.766
They'll be driving all over
the city just like Uber...

29:19.767 --> 29:20.667
Okay. Right.

29:20.668 --> 29:22.625
...and then they'll get
their... their dish call.

29:22.626 --> 29:24.999
I just don't understand how you and
I are getting it on after dinner

29:25.000 --> 29:27.833
if there's a rando stranger
in the house doing the dishes.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.999
Oh, my God.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.583
- It's that cop. Come, come, come on!
- Okay, okay.

29:34.584 --> 29:36.333
You're not answering
any of my questions.

29:36.334 --> 29:38.124
Well, I just wanna tell you,

29:38.125 --> 29:43.958
I'm here to support
the men in blue 110%.

29:43.959 --> 29:47.041
Okay, uh, we need a plan.
We gotta come up with a plan.

29:47.042 --> 29:50.124
- What's the story? What do we say?
- Um, okay, here it is.

29:50.125 --> 29:51.999
We went across the street
to buy some lemonade

29:52.000 --> 29:53.500
from these Girl Scouts.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.999
One of the Girl
Scouts is Asian.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.249
It's good to be specific
when you lie.

29:56.250 --> 29:57.333
It's the cornerstone
of a good lie.

29:57.334 --> 29:58.375
- Okay.
- Okay?

29:58.376 --> 29:59.875
And the lemonade
was delicious.

29:59.876 --> 30:01.583
- Yes. I can taste it.
- Delicious lemonade.

30:01.584 --> 30:04.875
Yes, and all of a sudden, a gust
of Santa Ana wind comes along

30:04.876 --> 30:07.875
and knocks the rake off the
roof onto the hood of the car.

30:07.876 --> 30:09.333
- Yes. Okay, I can...
- Got it?

30:09.334 --> 30:10.708
I got it. Yes, of course.
Are you kidding?

30:10.709 --> 30:12.416
I did Shakespeare.
I can handle this.

30:14.084 --> 30:16.875
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

30:16.876 --> 30:18.083
You vandalized my car.

30:18.084 --> 30:20.667
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

30:20.668 --> 30:25.875
Officer, we were standing
across the street

30:25.876 --> 30:28.375
from your vehicle,

30:28.376 --> 30:33.541
buying some lemonade
from a... a stand.

30:33.542 --> 30:35.540
It's like a, you know,
the wooden with..

30:35.541 --> 30:36.841
- Lemonade stand?
- ..a sign...

30:36.842 --> 30:38.333
..the lemonade stand.

30:38.334 --> 30:40.625
They were the little ones,
the Brownies,

30:40.626 --> 30:43.667
one of whom was Indian.

30:43.668 --> 30:49.667
And we decided that we actually
wanted Arnold Parkers,

30:49.668 --> 30:51.458
- and so...
- Palmers.

30:51.459 --> 30:54.166
- I don't think so.
- Palmer.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.163
Arnold Palmer.

30:55.163 --> 30:57.583
Well, let's leave that
detail for another day.

30:57.584 --> 31:01.249
At any rate,
he went into the house to...

31:01.250 --> 31:01.750
He?

31:01.751 --> 31:04.750
...retrieve the...
yes, there was a man.

31:04.751 --> 31:08.249
An Irishman who went
into the house.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.083
He said...
"I'll go get you...

31:10.084 --> 31:13.917
ye the iced tea
for the Arnold Parker."

31:13.918 --> 31:15.625
And so, while we were waiting

31:15.626 --> 31:19.041
for the Arnolds Palm...
whatever it is.

31:19.042 --> 31:22.208
- Palmer!
- Anyway, a gust of wind came.

31:22.209 --> 31:25.124
- It blew a rake off of the, um..
- The roof!

31:25.125 --> 31:25.625
..roof!

31:25.626 --> 31:28.708
- Off the roof of the house onto the car.
- I was handling it.

31:28.709 --> 31:32.000
Anyway, it blew the rake
off of the roof...

31:33.292 --> 31:38.041
and that's how your car
was damaged.

31:38.042 --> 31:39.875
All right,
you're coming with me.

31:39.876 --> 31:41.291
It landed on your vehicle.

31:41.292 --> 31:42.667
Great! Great performance!

31:42.668 --> 31:44.375
- You're an actress?
- You know what?

31:44.376 --> 31:46.416
That's the worst performance
I've ever seen in my life!

31:46.417 --> 31:48.124
- You!
- It was a bad script, Larry.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.917
- You wrote me a bad script!
- Oh, oh, a gust of wind.

31:50.918 --> 31:52.625
I do better with a little
more preparation.

31:52.626 --> 31:54.124
You should arrest her
for bad acting.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.958
Look, I need a rehearsal.
I'm not a one-take wonder.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.875
- Give me a break.
- Fuck you, Elvid.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.833
Hello?
What the fuck?!

32:01.834 --> 32:03.992
Hi. I'm the manager. Sorry..

32:03.993 --> 32:07.291
- there has been a delay in your meal.
- What's taking so long?

32:07.292 --> 32:11.124
Well, there's been a
disturbance in the kitchen.
