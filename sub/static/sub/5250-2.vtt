00:04.403 --> 00:05.670
In one of those condos that people

00:05.671 --> 00:07.105
rent out for pilot season.

00:07.106 --> 00:08.609
Yeah, the ones where the bathrooms

00:08.610 --> 00:10.042
are basically coated

00:10.043 --> 00:12.244
so it's easier to wash off suicide blood.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.313
And all of a sudden we hear,

00:13.314 --> 00:14.514
"Hold the door!"

00:14.515 --> 00:16.146
and into the elevator runs these

00:16.148 --> 00:18.650
three rats in Swarovski crystal collars.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.252
- Chihuahuas.
- And then,

00:20.253 --> 00:22.687
as if summoned by some higher power,

00:22.688 --> 00:24.758
the dark silhouette of their owner

00:24.759 --> 00:26.425
enters the frame.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.295
And it's Katharine McPhee.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.731
(man coughing)

00:31.732 --> 00:34.300
From "Smash."

"American Idol"?

Hour two of us stuck in an elevator...

- Yes.

I found this guy I used to have a crush on

07:18.637 --> 07:20.206
in high school on Facebook.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.473
- Fun.
- Kind of.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.041
He never knew I was alive.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.311
I find that impossible to believe.

07:24.312 --> 07:25.678
Oh, Arthur.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.711
Why don't you get together?

07:26.712 --> 07:28.012
- Really?
- Sure, show him

07:28.013 --> 07:29.380
how great you're doing.

07:29.381 --> 07:30.682
Are you sure you'd be cool with that?

07:30.683 --> 07:32.652
Of course! It's not like it's a date.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.620
- It's not?
- No, no, no.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.121
Do it here.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.655
Have him over for a glass of wine,

07:37.656 --> 07:39.290
I'll make quiche from scratch.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.025
Okay, but if we do, you have to pretend

07:41.026 --> 07:42.495
I'm really, really super successful

07:42.496 --> 07:45.564
and I'm in an amazing relationship.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.098
I mean, that's all true.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure,

07:48.133 --> 07:49.233
but you know what I mean.

07:49.234 --> 07:50.301
You have to be all over me,

07:50.302 --> 07:51.204
that way we can send him home

07:51.205 --> 07:52.104
feeling bad.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.572
I love this plan.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.342
Look, he's in a canoe.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.043
Good news!

07:58.044 --> 07:59.446
Matthew went up a whole size

07:59.447 --> 08:01.580
in a jazz shoe!

08:01.581 --> 08:03.748
Thanks for the shopping spree, Mama D.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.316
Did you get anything for me?

08:05.317 --> 08:07.420
No, we didn't pass by the Salvation Army.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.022
Ohh! Read him.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.424
The library is open, diva!

08:12.425 --> 08:13.692
Oh, is it open?

08:13.693 --> 08:15.227
Library's open.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.295
No.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.262
No.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.464
No. No.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.564

08:19.565 --> 08:20.999
Something with Angela Lansbury

08:21.000 --> 08:22.335
or Ms. Kate Capshaw.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.736
It's that kinda day.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.003
Welcome back to "What
Are You Going To Do?"

08:25.004 --> 08:26.104
No, no, stop, stop!

08:26.105 --> 08:27.340
- I love this show.
- Me too.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.575
Why? It's a stupid, fake show.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.342
Right? Like people would just walk past

08:31.343 --> 08:33.611
a breastfeeding woman getting fired?

08:33.611 --> 08:34.681
- Please!
- Man, shut up,

08:34.682 --> 08:36.582
it's perfect.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.282
In like half an hour, I'm gonna beat you.

08:38.283 --> 08:40.150
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Don't touch me!

08:40.152 --> 08:41.552
Who is this? Do you know--

08:41.553 --> 08:42.620
The only people who will stop and do

08:42.621 --> 08:44.222
the right thing are black men.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.759
It's like they give us
a new test every week

08:45.760 --> 08:47.126
and we keep winning.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.628
Yeah, I saw someone in trouble

08:48.629 --> 08:50.129
and I decided to help.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.029
You know, I saw this guy

08:51.030 --> 08:52.296
yelling at this girl--

08:52.297 --> 08:53.398
I just like it 'cause it shows people

08:53.399 --> 08:55.133
walking past others in need.

(clang, glass breaking)

God dammit!

08:58.204 --> 08:59.471
Again!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.439
This place is falling apart, girl.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.543
I'm not your girl, I'm your boss.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.210
Nate, take your toolbox

09:05.211 --> 09:06.444
and go fix this light

09:06.445 --> 09:08.048
before it falls on someone's head

09:08.049 --> 09:09.181
and we get sued.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.250
My hands are greasy.

09:10.251 --> 09:11.683
Billy, will you...

09:11.684 --> 09:14.119
No, I can't. I don't...

09:14.120 --> 09:15.187
Big surprise.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.389
Seriously. Open the toolbox

09:17.390 --> 09:19.324
and pick up the power drill.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.293
Oh! Like in "Body Double."

09:21.294 --> 09:22.462
Melanie Griffith in that movie

09:22.463 --> 09:24.329
was beyond.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.198
Why don't you know how to use

09:25.199 --> 09:26.298
a power drill?

09:26.299 --> 09:27.667
Because my father is dead

09:27.668 --> 09:31.036
and when he was alive, he was Jewish.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.404
You know what?

09:43.084 --> 09:44.116
Amazing!

09:44.117 --> 09:45.651
I'm getting a new dad.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.420
He's black.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.055
Now, be careful with that,

09:51.056 --> 09:52.323
you can electrocute yourself.

09:52.324 --> 09:53.691
I don't know how I'm gonna fix this.

09:53.692 --> 09:55.193
I don't know either, but we gonna try.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.561
Now, pick up that screwdriver--

09:56.562 --> 09:58.129
This looks a little like Shirley MacLaine.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.730
That right? All right,
let's screw this in.

09:59.731 --> 10:01.668
All right, I'm gonna screw it in.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.068
Nate.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.504
How many of those have you had?

10:04.505 --> 10:05.671
None of 'em.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.213
But I bet I can teach you both in an hour.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.214
Can we make it 15 minutes?

10:16.215 --> 10:17.517

14:37.377 --> 14:38.676
You got distracted and you hit something!

14:38.677 --> 14:40.244
You gave me permission to be emotional.

14:40.245 --> 14:41.547
Just get outta the van, man.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.217
- What?
- Get out of the van!

Shhh. What the hell?

14:56.728 --> 14:58.264
What? We hit a cyclist?

Not just any cyclist,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.466
we hit David Byrne,

15:01.467 --> 15:03.268
from The Talking Heads.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.771

Who the hell is David Byrnes?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.576
David Byrne!

15:11.577 --> 15:13.177
He was the lead singer
of The Talking Heads!

15:13.178 --> 15:14.313
Is! Is the lead singer!

15:14.314 --> 15:15.514
He's still alive.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.682
Okay, that was my next question.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.717
Yes. I think he's okay.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.084
I mean, some of his recent stuff

15:20.085 --> 15:21.218
has been pretty pretentious,

15:21.219 --> 15:22.219
but he gets a lifetime pass

15:22.220 --> 15:23.654
for "Stop Making Sense."

15:23.655 --> 15:25.322
I mean, he's one of those,
like, ugly guys that

15:25.323 --> 15:27.158
- ...Julie likes to fuck.
- Stop talking.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.459

15:28.460 --> 15:30.094
before somebody gets my license plate.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.495
What? This is a crime scene.

15:31.496 --> 15:33.330
I don't care! I'm not
gonna be the black man

15:33.331 --> 15:34.565
who killed David Byrnes.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.033
Oh, really? What happened to, uh,

15:36.034 --> 15:37.301
black guys always do the right thing?

15:37.302 --> 15:38.536
Like on "What Are You Going To Do?"

15:38.537 --> 15:39.570
That is a TV show called

15:39.571 --> 15:40.604
"What Are You Going To Do?"

15:40.605 --> 15:42.039
Oh, is that a TV show?

15:42.040 --> 15:43.407
Oh really? Oh, I thought it was real life.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.675
This is a show on real life

15:44.676 --> 15:46.177
called "What I'm Gonna Do Right Now."

15:46.178 --> 15:47.146
- And you say he's okay?
- Can you believe that?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.280
Seriously?

You are not the boss of me.

Oh really?

22:24.743 --> 22:26.343
When you think no one's looking...

22:26.344 --> 22:28.512
You can't fire me for
breastfeeding at work!

22:28.513 --> 22:30.414
- ...we are.
- I'm not going anywhere!

22:30.415 --> 22:31.615
This is my legal right!

22:31.616 --> 22:32.583
You know what I want?

22:32.584 --> 22:33.684
A grilled cheese.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.754
Oh, I would love a cheeseburger.
