Text Michelle.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.245
Text Michelle what?

00:13.247 --> 00:15.080
Not you. I have a
new dictation app.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.048
It works like a charm.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.783

Text Michelle.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.485
FEMALE VOICE:
Sorry. I don't understand you.

Clearly.

Text Michelle.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.058
What do you want
to say to Michelle?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.026
Ah.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.794
Plummer's coming at 2:00.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.299
Wow, that works really well.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.701
Do you want me to send it?

00:35.703 --> 00:36.702
Yes.
No.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.703
Message sent.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.304
Give me that.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.539
(siren whoops)

00:42.108 --> 00:44.643
Just what I
wanted to avoid.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.513
Not supposed
to text and drive, Sam.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.114
Need to obey the law
once in a while.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.182
Yeah.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.622
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:56.624 --> 00:57.689
(chuckling):
Okay.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.757
The hell?

01:00.226 --> 01:01.493
That's FBI.

01:03.630 --> 01:04.763
WOMAN:
Agent Hanna!

01:04.765 --> 01:07.299
Place both hands
out of the window now.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.100
What?

01:08.102 --> 01:09.168
Now!

01:10.303 --> 01:12.404
Open the car door
with your right hand.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.073
MAN:
Agent Callen,
remain in the car.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.307
Keep your hands on the dash.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.276
What's this about?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.811
Step out of the vehicle.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.282
Place both hands
behind your head.

01:24.684 --> 01:25.818
I'm an armed federal agent.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.787
My gun is on
the small of my back.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.390
Walk backwards
towards me.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.158
Stop right there.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.160
What's this about?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.161
On your knees.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.199
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:45.371 --> 01:46.839
Mr. Hanna,

01:46.841 --> 01:50.709
I'm afraid we have to cooperate.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.312
You're under arrest
for murder.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.375
What is that?

02:23.377 --> 02:24.376
Durian.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.878
King of fruit.
So hot right now.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.246
Since when
is fruit hot?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.580
Uh, since the Garden
of Eden.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.215
Then it was an apple,
but fruit has evolved.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.884
This one might be
more evolved than you.

02:31.886 --> 02:32.885
(mock laughs)

02:32.887 --> 02:36.155
Açaí, goji, mangosteen...

02:36.157 --> 02:38.357
But this is at another
level completely.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.592
This is a stimulant,
a mood enhancer

02:40.594 --> 02:42.294
and an aphrodisiac-- what?!--
all rolled into one.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.163
And then I put it
in my morning smoothie.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.230
What's up?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.900
I-I think you're gonna
need a bigger knife.

02:47.902 --> 02:50.669
HETTY:
I understand, Madam Secretary,

02:50.671 --> 02:53.939
but Sam Hanna is an agent
of the highest order

02:53.941 --> 02:57.242
and I have cooperated
with you fully.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.311
I need some
answers.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.348
Make haste,
Madam Secretary.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.751
Did she give you any indication
what this was about?

03:05.753 --> 03:08.554
No. And she's not going to,
Agent Callen.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.655
Agent Hanna's case

03:09.657 --> 03:11.290
is running
through DOJ.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.958
We can't interfere
in any way.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.227
And FBI's not
allowing visitors.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.662
Sir, what's going on?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.297
Sam was arrested.
DEEKS: For what?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.399
I'm not gonna just sit
around and do nothing.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.468
That's exactly
what you're going to do.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.537
You've been restricted
from field duty.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.439
Gonna need
your badge.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.683
I'll inform Michelle.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.219
(whistles sharply)

03:40.221 --> 03:41.386
Case on deck.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.387
DEEKS:
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.656
What is he charged with?
Murder.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.757
What?

03:45.759 --> 03:48.427
There is a case on deck.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.697
Please report
to Ops.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.300
As ordered.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.309
Lance Corporal Kevin Bronner.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.411
Found dead in his office

04:06.413 --> 04:08.413
at Bremerton Naval Base.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.815
DEEKS: Bremerton?
Wait, in Washington?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.416
Why are we even
looking into this?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.618
Is that a murder weapon?

04:12.620 --> 04:13.785
Because this
looks like a suicide.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.953
Hetty...

04:14.955 --> 04:16.321
Ms. Jones...

04:16.323 --> 04:18.023
Assistant
Director Granger?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.258
He's left the building.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.626
He's making a right on Lincoln.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.430
Activate isolation protocol.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.399
Yes, ma'am.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.635
Okay. Thank you.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.669
Let's go.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.737
Quickly.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.278
Commencing shadow mode.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.445
I always wanted to say that.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.281
DEEKS:
Wait. What's going on?

04:42.283 --> 04:44.349
It's called
protecting our assets.

04:45.885 --> 04:46.818
Ops is now secure.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.620
Let's get to work.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.722
Here's what we know.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.357
Sam has been arrested

04:52.359 --> 04:53.859
for the murder
of Leyla Walden, 46.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.861
She was found dead
three days ago

04:55.863 --> 04:57.362
in her Van Nuys
apartment.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.298
Who is she?
NELL:
We've been
running her name

04:59.300 --> 05:00.766
through several databases.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.368
So far, no connection
to NCIS or Sam.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.538
And we're still in the dark
about what the FBI has.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.540
NELL: She's been working
at a real estate agency

05:08.542 --> 05:09.808
for the past
six months.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.810
Before that, various
jobs as a bookkeeper.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.746
Okay, maybe she was
helping Sam find a place.

05:14.748 --> 05:19.051
Sam keeps his valuables in a
fireproof safe under his floor.

05:19.053 --> 05:22.054
And he's not letting a stranger
handle his finances.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.056
Well, that's assuming
she's a stranger. Right?

05:24.058 --> 05:25.624
What are you saying?

05:25.626 --> 05:27.759
Well, I'm saying
there's gotta be a connection

05:27.761 --> 05:30.629
and you can't possibly know
all of Sam's friends.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.830
You know all of Kensi's friends?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.432
Yeah, 'cause I'm the only one.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.566
Uh, thank you
for that.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.734
I know my partner.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.102
Okay, so, then you probably know

05:37.104 --> 05:38.937
where he was
when this woman was murdered.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.472
Now he needs an alibi, huh?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.074
Dude, I'm not attacking
his character.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.076
I'm just saying we have
to think like the FBI.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.078
HETTY:
Mr. Hanna

05:46.080 --> 05:47.579
was working for us

05:47.581 --> 05:49.581
on an old case
that needed revisiting.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.383
He was undercover with an alias.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.951
There was no agent covering him.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.119
So he has no alibi.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.520
Exactly.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.655
Start with the crime scene.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.589
And you?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.024
Me?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.760
I'm confined to my desk.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.998
Who knew that crime
scene sanitation

06:07.000 --> 06:09.735
Maybe you should consider
a career change.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.403
(vacuum whirring)
And this vacuum
is awesome.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.438
Hey, keep that thing
away from me, Ghostbuster.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.706
Just so you know,
I'm not wearing

06:14.708 --> 06:15.841
any clothes
underneath here.
Oh.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.409
MAN:
It's all yours.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.544
Hey. Watch where you
point that thing.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.879
DEEKS:
Sorry.
KENSI:
Thank you.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.013
(vacuum whirring)

06:22.015 --> 06:23.448
Ow! Deeks, stop.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.686
No sign of forced entry.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.889
Probably knew
the attacker.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.958
Let him in
voluntarily.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.461
You see any blood?

06:36.463 --> 06:38.463
No.
Oh...

06:38.465 --> 06:39.698
No signs of a struggle, either.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.134
I see quinoa and lentil.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.435
Kidney beans.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.503
Proteins.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.438
Sounds like a vegetarian to me.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.406
Oh!

06:47.408 --> 06:49.040
Check it out, huh?

06:49.042 --> 06:50.442
A durian.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.144
So hot
right now.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.446
I got my finger on the pulse
of hip fruit or what?

06:54.448 --> 06:55.947
Hmm.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.184
Wonder why a vegetarian has

06:59.186 --> 07:01.820
a bowl full of mints
from Canter's Deli.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.524
I also have
a calendar

07:05.526 --> 07:06.792
from Canter's Deli.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.996
That's a
little odd.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.900
A sandwich for
every month?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.067
Carnivore's dream.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.003
So what is a vegan
doing at the home

07:18.005 --> 07:19.938
of the world's best
pastrami sandwich?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.873
That's a damn
good question.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.176
We need to see if Hanna's
prints are at the crime scene.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.877
I'm pushing the lab
for the results.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.945
Good.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.785
Why don't you go ahead
and leave it in park?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.454
Who the hell are you?

07:35.456 --> 07:36.721
This is Agent Callen,

07:36.723 --> 07:39.691
You must be Assistant
U.S. Attorney Sullivan.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.059
Get out
of the car.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.127
Tell me everything
you have on Hanna.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.462
Do not make me pull out my gun.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.096
Well, if you did that,

07:45.098 --> 07:46.231
I'd just take it from you.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.833
You're never gonna get my gun.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.568
Look, I don't think
you understand

07:49.570 --> 07:51.169
the consequences
of your actions.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.873
who's done more for this country
than any man I know.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.541
Now, answer my question.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.742
Okay.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.911
Okay, I'll make it
easy for you.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.780
Lab report.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.683
Sam Hanna's DNA
was found on the victim.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.932
Type faster.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.767
Callen, hacking
is like sex.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.604
You've got to get to know all
the aspects of the server:

08:25.606 --> 08:27.506
her secrets, her fears.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.673
HETTY:
If you believe that

08:28.675 --> 08:29.875
hacking is like sex,

08:29.877 --> 08:31.810
Mr. Beale,

08:31.812 --> 08:34.112
then we need to have
a very long talk.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.780
Type faster.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.083
Lab report said that DNA
from skin cells

08:38.085 --> 08:39.885
found at the scene
matched Sam's.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.152
ERIC:
I'm in.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.689
NELL:
FBI's case report says
a Navy watch cap

08:44.691 --> 08:45.724
was found under Leyla's body

08:45.726 --> 08:48.093
with Sam's
DNA on it.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.628
ERIC:
What'd they match
the DNA to?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.962
The FBI shouldn't
have access

08:50.964 --> 08:52.764
to his armed forces
DNA sample.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.699
They might have
obtained it illegally.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.301
Either way, the sample
could have been switched.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.136
Compare the DNA
to Sam's NCIS sample.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.974
It says cause of death
was a broken neck.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.178
And the FBI pulled footage

09:07.180 --> 09:09.714
from the apartment
surveillance cameras.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.715
Run it, please.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.017
NELL:
Here it comes.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.691
Fast-forward to where he exits.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.226
Uh-huh.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.200
ERIC:
It looks just
like Sam.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.636
NELL:
No cap.
He left it.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.672
He's turning his face away
to avoid the camera.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.342
NELL:
Once the suspect

09:37.344 --> 09:39.911
left the building,
FBI found

09:39.913 --> 09:41.212
no trace of him on any cameras

09:41.214 --> 09:42.581
in the surrounding area.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.917
To escape and evade
like that is...

09:45.919 --> 09:47.752
Not easy.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.090
To snap a neck like that...

09:52.092 --> 09:53.959
Takes a pro.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.329
Okay.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.698
On the left is the DNA
from the crime scene.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.068
On the right is the sample
that Sam gave Hetty.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.276
It's a perfect match.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.947
DEEKS:
So you a corned beef
or pastrami girl?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.650
Uh... both,
actually.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.784
Lots of mayo.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.720
No. No, see,
that's blasphemous.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.288
It's mustard, rye, that's it.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.322
Why... why would...

10:24.324 --> 10:25.690
I can't talk to you.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.125
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.860
Uh... it's a sandwich.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.795
I can have it however I want.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.297
DEEKS:
No, it's a religious experience.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.299
People think that being Jewish
is about the Torah.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.900
They're wrong.
It's about the pastrami.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.636
So you're an expert
on Judaism now?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.970
I've had some intimate
Jewish relationships.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.674
Yeah, 6,000 years of religion
and you've learned what?

10:42.676 --> 10:43.675
No mayo.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.977
Mustard, rye, good pickle.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.978
I know a good pickle.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.147
I'm sure you do, honey.
Two?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.149
No, actually.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.651
Federal agents.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.152
I'm Agent Blye,
and this is Detective...

10:54.154 --> 10:55.220
Shapiro.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.223
Detective Shapiro.
I converted.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.026
You recognize her?

11:01.028 --> 11:03.695
I've seen her.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.963
Was she with anybody?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.232
Not that I remember.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.334
You sure?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.102
ERIC:
Hey, guys.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.104
Yeah, go for, uh...
for Shapiro.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.439
I'm sending you a still

11:14.441 --> 11:16.841
from Canter's parking lot
security cams.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.745
Leyla was always there
with a very formidable man.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.684
Wow, and that is
a formidable toupee.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.922
You can't forget a guy who lives
with a cat on his head.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.057
(sighs)

11:32.059 --> 11:34.959
Edna, Bubbie.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.430
Ray Turner.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.764
I think he likes me.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.932
He's a good guy.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.100
Excuse me.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.768
You get that, guys?
Right this way.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.236
NELL:
Yeah, searching.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.740
And... found him.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.076
Okay, Ray Turner.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.012
He's a former Navy SEAL
whose self-made mission is

11:54.014 --> 11:56.281
to track down
and expose Navy SEAL imposters,

11:56.283 --> 11:58.083
and catch it all on camera.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.820
I've got contacts throughout
the Navy SEAL community.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.990
So, all you frauds, cheats,
phonies, liars--

12:05.992 --> 12:07.992
I'm coming for you.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.961
And Turner was
looking into Sam?

12:09.963 --> 12:10.962
What does it matter?

12:10.964 --> 12:11.963
Sam's the real deal.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.099
Hmm, because of his NCIS cover,

12:14.101 --> 12:16.167
a lot of Sam's records
have been redacted.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.037
Might have led Turner to think
Sam was hiding something.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.005
Where's Callen?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.874
He's at Sam's
arraignment.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.309
DEEKS: You got an address
for Ray Turner?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.310
On your phones.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.112
Thank you.
Yep.

12:27.114 --> 12:31.483
GORDON:
Well, so you can stay late,
and we can go over the case.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.884
Yeah.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.219
(gasps)

12:34.221 --> 12:36.020
So sorry
about that.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.224
You have got to be kidding me.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.458
Missed you at the
arraignment today.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.827
Oh, that's right.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.162
There, uh...

12:44.164 --> 12:46.030
there wasn't one.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.500
The government couldn't
find Agent Hanna.

12:48.502 --> 12:51.236
Federal jail
system's complicated.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.138
Agent Hanna's just missing?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.406
You must want to be arrested.
For what?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.041
Trying to augment
my government salary

12:57.043 --> 12:59.043
with a little honest work
here at a fine restaurant?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.478
On the other hand,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.547
denying an American citizen
of due process...

13:02.549 --> 13:04.115
You are the lawyer,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.050
but it sounds to me
like that's breaking the law.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.318
Calm down.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.053
Agent Hanna isn't
getting bailed out anyway.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.421
He's a flight risk.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.823
Sam Hanna's a flight risk?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.191
Mmm.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.462
You lose him
in the system long enough

13:17.464 --> 13:19.130
to build a case against bail.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.965
Well done.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.135
Which lifer over at DOJ
taught you that trick, huh?

13:24.137 --> 13:27.472
Just because your partner
is a federal agent,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.407
doesn't mean he can get away
with murder.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.575
He did this.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.111
A federal agent's
a pretty big trophy.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.815
Could be your O.J. case, huh?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.917
GORDON:
You have got five seconds

13:38.919 --> 13:40.185
to get out of my face,

13:40.187 --> 13:42.020
before I arrest you
for interfering

13:42.022 --> 13:47.058
If you want to arrest me,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.165
By the way, I, uh...

13:54.167 --> 13:55.500
I recommend the lobster.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.838
He took my gun.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.272
Son of a bitch.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.309
GRANGER: I already got this
covered, Agent Callen.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.212
What are you doing here?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.347
Waiting for you to catch up.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.049
Let's step outside.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.551
Bring you up to speed
on Agent Gordon.

14:23.929 --> 14:27.966
So, the, uh, Canter's security
tape showed a gray GMC truck.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.434
I don't see it.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.869
(doorbell rings)

14:30.871 --> 14:33.238
Maybe he's not home.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.306
Well, let's check
out the back.

14:41.914 --> 14:42.947
Wow.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.183
That is a lot of MP5's up there.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.258
Whoa.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.060
I could have just
picked the lock.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.096
Yeah, and miss this opportunity
to impress you?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.998
You are part orangutan.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.066
You're looking at my butt,
aren't you?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.334
Damn right, you're
looking at my butt.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.137
Actually, I was spotting you
in case you fell,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.072
but, for that, now I'm not.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.041
That's all right.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.175
Just looking at you, butt.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.277
I don't blame her.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.511
It's a good butt.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.682
Uh... this guy's got
a whole arsenal in here.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.651
Kens?

15:19.653 --> 15:21.519
Bubala?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.221
All right, I'm going in.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.161
Wow.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.670
Little mousey
took the cheese.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.306
Put your weapon
on the floor.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.507
Okay.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.143
I'm LAPD, working on
a federal investigation.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.011
I know who you are.

15:47.013 --> 15:50.181
As far as I'm concerned, you're
a thief breaking into my house,

15:50.183 --> 15:52.116
which means I got
the right to shoot you.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.218
Okay, but if you shoot me
in the back, that's murder.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.219
Turn around.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.354
Mmm. Why would
I do that?

15:56.356 --> 15:57.355
Hey, where are
you going?

15:57.357 --> 15:58.423
Cut it...

15:58.425 --> 15:59.657
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just...

15:59.659 --> 16:01.159
Quit moving.
Don't shoot me
in the back,

16:01.161 --> 16:03.061
'cause that's murder.
You don't want to do that.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.195
What are you...

16:04.197 --> 16:07.031
Well, that is the eternal
question, isn't it?

16:07.033 --> 16:09.334
If you know who I am,
it's because Edna,

16:09.336 --> 16:12.370
who has a crush on you,
by the way, tipped you off.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.105
She has a crush on me?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.440
Did she say that?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.642
Why else would
she warn you?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.645
Mutual distrust
of the government.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.046
KENSI:
No, she's got a crush on you.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.381
Put the gun on the floor.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.049
Put it down.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.217
Hands behind
your back.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.251
Nice and easy.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.727
I know how to dissolve bodies
with sodium hydroxide.

16:35.729 --> 16:39.097
I could have shot you in the
back, and nobody'd ever know.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.233
You just became
a person of interest.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.369
Yeah, we should probably
go talk about that.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.587
(knuckles cracking)

17:02.589 --> 17:04.055
Could you...?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.757
Could you
stop, please?

17:05.759 --> 17:08.092
Gets the oxygen
flowing.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.228
Adequate oxygen delivery
is crucial

17:10.230 --> 17:12.463
in a confinement
scenario.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.731
You think this
is confinement?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.067
A ventilated room
with a salty sea breeze.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.502
What, do you want a bunker? Huh?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.536
Maybe a dungeon?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.605
I'll take whatever
you throw at me.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.774
I'd just like to have a chat.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.276
I'd rather bury myself alive.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.111
Seems a little excessive.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.347
I don't talk
to people I don't trust.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.216
And I don't trust anyone
in law enforcement.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.484
Nothing personal.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.053
You're a Navy SEAL.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.256
We are the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.791
Kind of puts us on your side.

17:39.793 --> 17:44.128
Yet you took me against my will
from my place of residence.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.830
It's more like a fortress.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.498
Who do you think
is coming for you?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.268
You got a lot
of enemies, Turner?

17:50.270 --> 17:53.137
I mean, those frauds
that you out on your Web site,

17:53.139 --> 17:54.772
they can't take that lightly.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.109
I'm not worried
about those guys.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.711
If those idiots have
one thing in common, it's--

18:00.713 --> 18:02.413
they're all a bunch of cowards.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.781
Then why go after them at all?

18:03.783 --> 18:06.117
Because they're fakes.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.618
Wannabes that aren't qualified

18:07.620 --> 18:10.354
to shine the shoes
of an authentic SEAL.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.592
Who sabotaged
our enemies in 'Nam?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.793
SEALs.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.129
Who was the first
into Baghdad?

18:18.131 --> 18:19.230
SEALs.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.099
Who killed Osama bin Laden?

18:21.101 --> 18:21.799
Otters?

18:23.569 --> 18:26.537
Majority of SEAL missions
are covert.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.406
Highly classified.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.841
No one knows about them.

18:29.843 --> 18:33.311
The real deal doesn't do it
for praise or recognition.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.646
Mm-hmm, they do it
for the ladies.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.816
Speaking of the ladies,
how do you know, uh, Leyla?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.552
Never seen her before.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.553
Really?

18:42.555 --> 18:43.554
That's interesting.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.889
Then, uh...

18:44.891 --> 18:47.391
how do you explain... this?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.631
Must be someone else.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.166
Come on.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.767
We know you were meeting her
every Tuesday

18:56.769 --> 18:58.402
for the last six weeks.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.738
Edna tell you that?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.808
Oh, she might be
a little jealous.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.143
Of Leyla?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.177
Mmm.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.245
Really?

19:10.249 --> 19:12.183
Oh, you're good.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.851
Very convincing.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.253
But no dice.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.189
I'm prepared to stay
here all night.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.724
Kind of sounds
like you want to.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.360
Endured 36 hours
of waterboarding.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.828
36 hours?

19:23.830 --> 19:24.862
Now who's embellishing?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.365
Self-induced.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.900
Okay.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.702
Leyla's dead.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.438
Did we mention that?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.507
Murdered.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.812
Now you want to tell us
why you met with her?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.820
(knocking on the door)

19:49.822 --> 19:51.556
Who is it?

19:51.558 --> 19:54.859
CALLEN:
Housekeeping.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.627
Ugh, this guy
doesn't give up.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.930
I know who you're with in there.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.699
Would you like me to
break down the door,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.267
or you want to
just let me in?

20:03.269 --> 20:04.869
We got to get
out of here.
Okay.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.938
Okay, here I come.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.747
Damn, where's
the car?

20:16.749 --> 20:17.815
My shoe.
Forget it.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.220
Wonder how the wife's
gonna feel about this.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.958
Or, better yet, the
director of the Bureau.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.394
Federal prosecutor in bed
with one of his agents.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.463
Literally.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.969
Do you think
he did it?

20:37.971 --> 20:39.403
I don't know.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.340
Till we know why
he met with Leyla,

20:42.342 --> 20:43.674
we don't have a...

20:43.676 --> 20:45.643
Granger.
I was gonna
say motive...

20:45.645 --> 20:47.411
Give it a rest.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.914
I made my public
declaration.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.249
So, this was all for show?

20:51.251 --> 20:52.950
Yeah, it's called...

20:52.952 --> 20:53.951
Protecting your assets.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.753
Sam.
They bailed you out.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.489
It's amazing
how fast it happened

20:58.491 --> 20:59.657
once they
were motivated.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.691
Turner still not talking?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.593
DEEKS:
He's a durian.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.028
And, by that, he means
prickly, self-protective

21:04.030 --> 21:05.029
and hard to crack.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.631
I'll have a go at him.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.765
Let's do it.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.899
Oh, no, no, no, no.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.502
Better I talk to him,
SEAL to SEAL.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.037
Okay.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.749
Sam Hanna, NCIS,

21:24.751 --> 21:26.917
Navy SEAL.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.419
Nice.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.655
Did you get that on eBay?

21:32.591 --> 21:34.058
Look, I know Don Shipley.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.360
He does what you do--
outs fake SEALs,

21:36.362 --> 21:37.595
but I never
heard of you.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.430
I never heard of you.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.870
Let's just assume
we're on the same side.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.571
I'm a fellow SEAL,

21:47.573 --> 21:49.840
and this morning I was arrested
for a crime I didn't commit.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.475
Join the club.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.744
For the murder of a woman
I've never met.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.812
Leyla.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.814
And yet, DNA evidence

21:56.816 --> 21:59.517
puts me at her apartment,
a place I've never been.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.319
Why you telling me this?

22:01.321 --> 22:04.021
Because I can tell
you respect honesty.

22:05.891 --> 22:09.327
You knew Leyla.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.763
You're the only one
who can speak on her behalf.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.100
I got to talk
to some of my contacts,

22:16.102 --> 22:18.002
make sure you check out.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.071
I understand.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.441
You're free to go.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.392
Let's follow him.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.061
See where he goes.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.646
You think that's his boat?

23:02.648 --> 23:04.715
Let's find out.

23:14.926 --> 23:17.795
It's his.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.399
SEALs always say, "The only
easy day was yesterday."

23:21.401 --> 23:23.067
(cell phone ringing)

23:29.040 --> 23:30.674
It's a video call from Turner.

23:36.048 --> 23:39.717
I knew you were trailing me
the whole time.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.652
Well, you're
a slippery SEAL, huh?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.521
You could've
walked around.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.122
Where's the fun in that?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.992
That toupee act
as a flotation device for you?

23:47.994 --> 23:49.126
It's not a toupee.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.961
Why does everybody
always say that?

23:50.963 --> 23:53.731
I just have
thick hair.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.876
Ooh, boy.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.692
(indistinct chatter)

24:21.694 --> 24:24.862
CALLEN:
What do you think
he's telling her?

24:24.864 --> 24:27.765
He didn't trust us.
He's not gonna trust the FBI.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.537
Found the trigger.

24:34.506 --> 24:35.773
Cell phone.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.208
So it was close.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.810
Close enough to think that
Turner was still on the boat.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.878
Thanks, Salazar.

24:42.681 --> 24:45.883
They could've been
anywhere around here.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.487
Sorry about before.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.155
I made some calls.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.823
Gonna pull back
the curtain,

24:52.825 --> 24:54.592
let you work with me on this.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.727
Work with you?
Mm-hmm?

24:56.729 --> 24:57.828
Sam checks out now?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.763
Oh, more than checks out.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.967
is Sam Hanna is
who SEALs want to be

25:02.969 --> 25:04.835
when they grow up.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.005
See? Always liked this guy.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.541
Now, let's start with...

25:10.543 --> 25:12.543
Yeah, whoa. One second.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.812
Is he all right?

25:14.814 --> 25:16.180
Oh...

25:17.782 --> 25:19.116
Yeah.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.752
Not with the top secret stuff.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.053
Of course.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.225
So, why were you
meeting with Leyla?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.961
Oh, Leyla's just the tip
of the iceberg, my friend.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.898
I was looking into a guy
named Jeremy North.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.066
Former SEAL, owns
a fancy self-defense school.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.168
He was about to get

25:38.170 --> 25:40.170
into private security
big-time.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.939
Only he's not a real SEAL.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.009
You've got potential.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.213
Leyla was
his bookkeeper.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.681
That's why I was meeting
with her.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.783
We don't have any record
of him working with Leyla.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.951
She worked off the books.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.986
She knew everything about North.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.655
So, North killed her?

25:57.657 --> 26:00.658
Yeah. North had raised
seven million bucks

26:00.660 --> 26:02.793
to start his own little
Blackwater company.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.029
He was about to lose
the whole thing.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.897
Not to mention go to prison.

26:06.899 --> 26:07.965
Eric, can you...?

26:07.967 --> 26:10.134
Look into Jeremy North?

26:10.136 --> 26:11.135
Already on it.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.736
So, let me get this straight.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.071
North killed Leyla
because she was

26:14.073 --> 26:15.973
about to out him
as a fake Navy SEAL?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.074
Mm-hmm.

26:18.643 --> 26:19.677
It's the same thing

26:19.679 --> 26:20.911
he was about
to do to you.

26:20.913 --> 26:21.812
Fellas...

26:21.814 --> 26:24.848
a lot of people fear me.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.252
ERIC:
Guys?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.787
CALLEN:
What is it?

26:29.789 --> 26:32.323
You need to see this.

26:32.325 --> 26:33.924
You're not gonna believe it.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.829
You're a lucky man, Agent Hanna.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.098
Most people never
come face-to-face

26:41.100 --> 26:43.067
with their doppelganger.

26:43.069 --> 26:46.036
Meet Jeremy North,
also known as...

26:46.038 --> 26:47.204
Lee Stevens.

26:47.206 --> 26:52.776
He was a Marine when I was
an instructor down in Coronado.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.144
The other instructors
used to make fun of us

26:54.146 --> 26:55.279
because we looked
so much alike.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.148
That was a long time ago.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.384
You haven't seen him since?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.157
Sam?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.826
Agent Hanna?

27:08.828 --> 27:10.728
No.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.029
No, I haven't seen him.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.897
ERIC:
Stevens, aka North,

27:13.899 --> 27:15.899
has a dishonorable discharge,

27:15.901 --> 27:17.301
a criminal record for fraud

27:17.303 --> 27:18.636
and identity theft.

27:18.638 --> 27:19.970
His partners at the school

27:19.972 --> 27:22.740
are also claiming
to be ex-FBI, ex-CIA.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.909
from an escrow account
this morning, but...

27:25.911 --> 27:26.877
the bank denied it.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.145
They couldn't kill Turner.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.346
Now they're on the run.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.681
Mm-hmm.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.282
They need cash.

27:32.284 --> 27:35.386
NELL:
We also have an address
for the school and an office

27:35.388 --> 27:36.887
under Stevens's real name.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.022
They're not at the school.

27:38.024 --> 27:38.989
We should hit the office.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.324
It's our best shot.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.363
I'm not telling anybody
how to do their job.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.066
Yes. You are.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.402
Just a little bit.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.441
I can help you out with that.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.343
Change your life.

28:01.379 --> 28:02.746
I'm good.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.114
We'll take the office.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.416
Kensi, Deeks,
check the school.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.950
On it.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.886
Agent Callen?

28:09.888 --> 28:13.757
So, this is personal now.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.759
You need to watch your partner.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.394
Sam is not gonna...

28:17.396 --> 28:18.696
For his sake.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.805
(door closes)

28:27.807 --> 28:30.874
Wow, Stevens is doing all
right for himself, huh?

28:30.876 --> 28:33.010
Yeah, a place like this
costs a lot of dough.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.846
Pamphlet.

28:35.848 --> 28:39.083
You guys here
for Self-Defense 101?
KENSI: Yes!

28:39.085 --> 28:40.784
I am.
I'm not.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.953
I'm actually for the Navy SEAL
hand-to-hand combat class.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.255
Oh! Navy Seal hand-to-hand.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.858
Well, you know, that's
a pretty advanced course.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.793
Well, you know,
I've got some experience.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.361
I'd like to see you in action.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.831
Uh...

28:53.833 --> 28:55.966
Yeah, no,
Jeremy North--

28:55.968 --> 28:57.868
uh, he's a real
former Navy SEAL?

28:57.870 --> 28:59.903
Oh, yeah, he's the real deal.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.338
He's not here today,
but you'll meet him.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.339
Great.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.474
All right.
Why don't I get

29:03.476 --> 29:07.144
You can, uh, fill it out
while you watch the class.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.512
And you...

29:08.514 --> 29:10.047
I'll come back for you.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.248
Show you around.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.449
All right.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.484
KENSI:
Perfect. Thank you.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.519
DEEKS:
Show me a... round.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.354
Look at that cougar
on the hunt there.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.289
And you are a chew toy.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.325
Mm-hmm. I'm feeling pretty
naked and vulnerable.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.926
It's for the case.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.528
Uh, okay, I'll find
out what I can.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.863
But I'm definitely
not gonna...

29:25.865 --> 29:27.097
This is for Sam.
You're gonna do

29:27.099 --> 29:28.999
whatever you have to do
to get the information.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.367
Oh, you think I'm that easy?
Uh... mmm.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.401
Don't answer that.
No.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.903
Here's your paperwork.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.938
KENSI:
Thank you. Perfect.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.440
So, you guys together?

29:36.442 --> 29:37.975
Cousins.
Yes.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.109
Actually we're cousins.
From Kentucky.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.145
See, we came together.
We...

29:41.147 --> 29:42.846
But we're cousins.
Actually, you know what?

29:42.848 --> 29:44.081
We're close.
He-he's single.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.315
No...
Really single.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.885
Yup.
So sad. Have fun, cuz.

29:47.887 --> 29:48.952
Hi.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.487
Hi. I'm Heidi.
Hi.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.889
Heidi!
Yeah!

29:51.891 --> 29:53.090
How you doing?
Good. You?

29:53.092 --> 29:54.424
Good. Things are well.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.126
Great. Well, why don't
I show you around?

29:56.128 --> 29:58.562
You know, that SEALs class
can get pretty rough.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.864
Oh, you make it sound scary.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.099
(laughs)
Some people like it rough.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.101
Oh! This is happening.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.203
Uh...

30:10.141 --> 30:12.042
Hey, G and I will
go check it out.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.077
You stay in the car,
stand watch.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.080
Look, I know
this might get hairy.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.882
So, if something happens,

30:18.884 --> 30:20.050
I just want to say

30:20.052 --> 30:22.252
we make a great team.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.290
Right back at you.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.358
All right.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.205
(high-pitched whirring)

30:52.116 --> 30:53.350
Federal agents!

30:53.352 --> 30:54.852
Put your hands on
your head! Don't move.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.188
Show us your hands!

31:03.361 --> 31:06.096
(grunts)

31:13.071 --> 31:16.106
That's one of Stevens's guys.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.009
He's destroying evidence.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.245
Two to go.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.146
Plus Stevens.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.488
Blank California
driver's licenses.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.956
Blank passports.

31:32.958 --> 31:35.158
U.S. and Canada.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.028
It's an identity-theft factory.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.898
Which is gonna make
their getaway very easy.

31:55.613 --> 31:56.980
Whoa!

31:56.982 --> 31:58.582
I knew this guy was an imposter.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.951
I had no idea it went this far.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.253
Well, we know where
he gets his information

32:03.255 --> 32:05.088
for all those blank I.D.'s

32:05.090 --> 32:08.125
"Timothy Reed, 2003.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.694
Hugh Graham, 2004."

32:12.497 --> 32:15.265
"Sam Hanna, 2002."

32:20.204 --> 32:23.040
I still remember when this
disappeared from my locker.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.176
This guy's been collecting
identities for years.

32:27.545 --> 32:29.379
So, why not DNA?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.148
Much more valuable.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.350
He knew how much
you looked like him.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.619
So, he stole your watch cap.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.255
As a "get out
of jail free" card.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.424
I got to hand it to this guy.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.559
He knows how to plan ahead.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.997
All right, let me show you
where we keep the Muscle Milk.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.065
(laughs)

32:48.067 --> 32:49.199
(purrs)

32:51.169 --> 32:53.303
Oh... hmm.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.139
Oh!

32:56.141 --> 32:58.208
(grunting)

32:58.210 --> 32:59.576
This part of the VIP tour?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.211
Hi. That's happening.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.713
Uh, maybe we should...

33:02.715 --> 33:05.415
maybe we should talk
for a second.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.650
Oh, yeah?

33:06.652 --> 33:09.086
Yeah, let's talk, Detective.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.321
Sorry, what?

33:11.323 --> 33:12.356
You don't remember me?

33:12.358 --> 33:14.424
'Cause I sure
remember you.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.394
Few years ago.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.462
Drug bust.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.531
I was a working girl back then.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.400
Huh.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.634
Did I arrest you?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.403
Nah.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.739
You told me I was too good
to be doing this.

33:28.741 --> 33:29.740
Gave me 50 bucks.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.274
Whew.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.275
Always a charmer.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.543
Well, you were right.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.746
And look at me now.
I'm working a legit job.

33:35.748 --> 33:38.682
Yeah, about that, um...

33:38.684 --> 33:40.684
Are you and Jeremy close?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.753
That's why you're here?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.488
His real name is Lee Stevens.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.456
He's a con man
wanted for murder.

33:49.293 --> 33:50.293
Oh.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.294
Yeah.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.295
(clears throat)

33:52.297 --> 33:55.332
(laughs)

33:55.334 --> 33:57.801
I knew this was
too good to be true.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.037
He wanted me

34:00.039 --> 34:03.073
to do marketing for
his new security company.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.475
Thought I finally got lucky.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.544
I'm sorry.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.816
Have, uh... have you
talked to him today?

34:12.818 --> 34:14.684
Yeah, he...
he called this morning.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.154
He wanted me to bring him
50 grand from the safe.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.489
I told him I didn't want to
carry that kind of cash around,

34:19.491 --> 34:20.791
he should come get it himself.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.592
You still got that number
in your phone?

34:22.594 --> 34:23.727
Yeah.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.062
But it wasn't his cell.

34:25.064 --> 34:26.530
It was a different number.

34:26.532 --> 34:27.597
Um...

34:30.435 --> 34:32.102
Here it is.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.605
Want to help us catch him?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.443
All you gotta do is call him.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.544
Tell him you'll bring
the money.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.182
Yeah.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.284
Okay.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.618
Okay...

35:07.738 --> 35:11.374
Kensi, you got eyes on
any of Stevens's men?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.443
No, not yet.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.247
Give him a call, Heidi.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.220
(line ringing)

35:23.222 --> 35:24.888
Hey. Hey, I'm here.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.223
STEVENS:
You alone?

35:26.225 --> 35:27.557
Yeah, why?
What's going on?

35:27.559 --> 35:31.261
STEVENS:
There's a red laser
on your chest.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.629
Don't move in. He'll kill her.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.231
Copy that.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.732
CALLEN:
I've got one of Stevens' men

35:35.734 --> 35:37.334
by the fountain.
Black baseball cap.

35:42.707 --> 35:43.907
Guys, it looks like
the laser's coming

35:43.909 --> 35:45.742
from the second floor
of the Civic Center.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.210
What the hell are you doing?

35:47.212 --> 35:49.279
STEVENS:
You see David
walking towards you?

35:51.182 --> 35:53.283
Yeah.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.317
Yeah, we got him.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.453
STEVENS:
Just give him the bag

35:56.455 --> 35:57.687
and don't move
until I tell you, baby.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.623
Just do what he says, Heidi.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.724
I stick my neck out for you

36:00.726 --> 36:01.858
and this is what you do to me?

36:01.860 --> 36:04.761
STEVENS:
Stay right where you are.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.669
Don't move in till he takes
that laser off her.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.205
SAM:
He's not gonna take it off
until his guy's clear.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.582
He's getting into his car.
We're going to lose him.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.184
He's about
to pull out.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.919
I'm not letting them get away.

36:28.921 --> 36:30.220
Sam.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.322
Sam, don't.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.723
Take 'em now!
(gunshot)

36:33.725 --> 36:35.192
(Sam grunts, Heidi screams)

36:35.194 --> 36:36.293
Sam!

36:36.295 --> 36:38.195
(bystanders screaming)

36:38.197 --> 36:39.729
Federal agents!

36:39.731 --> 36:40.964
Hands where
we can see 'em!

36:42.700 --> 36:44.601
CALLEN:
Sam, you okay?

36:46.270 --> 36:47.370
Sam?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.572
I'm going for the shooter.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.814
(grunts)

37:00.251 --> 37:01.251
Federal agent.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.520
You're
under arrest.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.772
♪ ♪

37:39.857 --> 37:41.458
Federal agent, Lee.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.493
Long time, no see.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.428
Sam Hanna.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.864
You big and bad
with your badge now, huh?

37:47.866 --> 37:49.366
My badge?

37:49.368 --> 37:51.568
You want to give
all the credit to my badge?

38:03.414 --> 38:04.981
You killed an innocent woman.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.650
Framed me.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.552
Used my name,

38:09.554 --> 38:12.355
used my reputation.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.292
You tried to send me to jail.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.076
What you doing?

38:33.078 --> 38:35.478
Let's have at it.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.813
Come on, Navy SEAL.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.882
Let's see
what you got.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.518
No guns.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.919
No badge.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.424
Me and you.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.865
(choking)

39:00.738 --> 39:03.039
That was luck.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.541
I don't want
to beat you too fast.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.843
Come on, SEAL.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.012
Let's go at it again.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.113
See what you got.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.653
I didn't even have
to make a fist.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.436
What's wrong? You scared?

39:35.473 --> 39:39.042
Let me help you out.
Let me help you out.

39:40.478 --> 39:43.380
Come on, take it.

39:45.015 --> 39:46.883
Take it.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.653
Gotta have a deadly weapon

39:50.655 --> 39:52.155
so I can beat you to death.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.797
Lee...

40:00.799 --> 40:04.534
when I stop playing with you,

40:04.536 --> 40:06.569
things are gonna get brutal.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.638
It's your
last shot.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.941
Come on,
tough guy.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.082
(sobs)

40:19.084 --> 40:21.451
Ready for your beating?

40:21.453 --> 40:22.752
Or you want
some more humiliation?

40:22.754 --> 40:23.953
Come on, Sam.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.121
Come on.
Come on what?

40:25.123 --> 40:26.656
You're a Navy SEAL, right?

40:27.958 --> 40:29.426
Come on, man, I never said that.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.794
Oh, you're lying to me.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.662
You just made
your beating worse.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.865
(crying):
I'm so...

40:35.867 --> 40:37.534
Are you crying?

40:37.536 --> 40:38.701
(sobbing)

40:38.703 --> 40:40.837
Is this a Navy SEAL crying?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.038
I'm not a SEAL, man.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.039
I'm sorry.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.941
I'm sorry.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.910
Please, don't hurt me.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.812
Don't...

40:48.814 --> 40:49.979
SAM:
Tell me that again.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.681
I'm not a SEAL, man.
I'm sorry.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.217
I'm sorry.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.852
He crying?

40:55.854 --> 40:58.655
Can you believe it?

40:59.557 --> 41:01.925
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.226
(sobbing):
I'm sorry, man.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.727
Lee, I can't read
you your rights

41:04.729 --> 41:05.895
if you don't stop crying.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.530
Stop it.

41:07.532 --> 41:08.565
I'm serious.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.567
(sobbing)

41:10.569 --> 41:12.735
I'm really going
to hurt you.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.571
Don't hurt me.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.005
Put your hands
behind your back.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.474
Put your hands
behind your back.

41:17.476 --> 41:18.708
Lay down.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.543
Lay down!

41:21.479 --> 41:23.780
(Stevens sobbing)

41:26.217 --> 41:28.585
I'm sorry! I'm not a SEAL.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.487
TURNER:
They're all the same in the end.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.522
Pathetic.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.891
Can't take all
the credit on this.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.526
I had solid backup,

41:36.528 --> 41:38.595
covert operatives.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.497
Backup? That's what
he's calling us?

41:40.499 --> 41:42.165
When we're
the ones...
Let him have it, G.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.667
We all know
who the real hero is, anyway.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.103
You mean that rug rat
on the top of his head?

41:47.105 --> 41:48.638
KENSI:
Guys, think that's
made of real mink?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.772
GRANGER:
Well, I hope it had its shots.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.741
(chuckles)
SAM:
Think he lets it run

41:51.743 --> 41:53.076
on a hamster wheel at night?

41:53.078 --> 41:56.513
HETTY:
I once had an entire
family of them

41:56.515 --> 41:58.214
living under
my house.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.916
(loud crack)
Oh!

41:59.918 --> 42:01.651
Eureka!
Oh, I got it.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.586
Now I got it.

42:03.588 --> 42:04.721
What's that smell?

42:04.723 --> 42:08.258
Deeks, what the
hell is that?
Like sour milk...

42:08.260 --> 42:10.660
Heard of pineapple.
That smells like behind-apple.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.862
This is probably why
it's banned in some countries.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.664
I'm... I'm out.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.100
Yeah, me, too.

42:17.102 --> 42:19.135
Granger...

42:19.137 --> 42:20.770
want to join us
for a drink?

42:22.640 --> 42:23.806
Definitely.

42:23.808 --> 42:25.241
HETTY:
Mr. Deeks, get rid

42:25.243 --> 42:27.010
of that repulsive, smelly thing

42:27.012 --> 42:30.246
or this building really will
need to be condemned.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.016
<i>To the burn room, Mr. Deeks.</i>
