03:03.802 --> 03:05.169

03:05.203 --> 03:06.737
to put you in a leadership role, Cortez.

03:06.771 --> 03:09.206
Well, we get it right every now and then.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.209
Now, this woman was the backbone
of a sting that we ran in 2012.

03:12.243 --> 03:14.011
I did time undercover
when I worked gang unit.

03:14.045 --> 03:16.094
Got in pretty tight
with a crew called Los Huesos.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.048
Took down their leadership,
never blew her cover.

03:18.082 --> 03:19.183
That sounds about right.

03:19.217 --> 03:20.384
ROMERO: Unfortunately,

03:20.418 --> 03:22.352
Los Huesos are back.

03:22.387 --> 03:24.621
They're shipping up low-grade
amphetamines from Mexico.

03:24.656 --> 03:26.890
Cheaper and stronger than
Adderall, and they're shopping

03:26.925 --> 03:29.560
them to high school and college
students as study drugs.

03:29.594 --> 03:31.128
We've got about a half-dozen kids dead

03:31.162 --> 03:32.629
from heart attacks already.

03:32.664 --> 03:33.964
- He one of their heavies?
- No.

03:33.998 --> 03:34.965
No, this is one of ours.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.571
This is Special Agent Adrian Cruz.

03:36.605 --> 03:39.417
He's been embedded with Los Huesos
in L.A. for about six months.

03:39.451 --> 03:41.305
No idea when Los Huesos
started to doubt his cover,

03:41.339 --> 03:42.940
but they must have been following him.

03:42.974 --> 03:45.943
This morning, Cruz was
in the Palisades with his wife,

03:45.977 --> 03:47.878
nowhere near gang turf,
when they showed up

03:47.912 --> 03:49.780
out of the blue and snatched him.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.716
Rico Peña, found dead on the scene,

03:52.750 --> 03:55.285
and Eduardo "Flaco" Ruiz, Top dog in L.A.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.322
Agent Cruz's wife says Flaco's
the one who took her husband.

03:58.356 --> 03:59.756
JESSICA: I remember Rico.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.995
Never seen Flaco. He must be new.

04:02.029 --> 04:03.967
He was sent up from
Mexico about a year ago.

04:04.001 --> 04:06.430
The man he answers to
down there, however...

04:06.464 --> 04:08.465
that may ring a bell.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.967
JESSICA: Raul Lopez.

04:10.001 --> 04:12.102
- Raul's in Mexico?
- He's based in Mexico City,

04:12.136 --> 04:13.737
but he runs L.A.

04:13.771 --> 04:15.739
ROMERO: Raul did three years
for the sting Cortez ran.

04:15.773 --> 04:18.341
He moved his way up in prison,
then headed to Mexico

04:18.375 --> 04:20.142
as soon as he got out
and shot up the ranks.

04:20.178 --> 04:21.478
JESSICA: That's a quick rise.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.247
Raul was low-level when I worked him.

04:23.281 --> 04:25.515
Smart, but nothing close to a leader.

04:25.550 --> 04:27.150
Easy to rise when you take out

04:27.185 --> 04:28.785
the three guys ahead of you.

04:28.820 --> 04:31.001
He's not just smart, he's ruthless.

04:31.035 --> 04:33.323
Nothing goes down in L.A.
without Raul signing off.

04:33.358 --> 04:35.492
He will know where Flaco is keeping Cruz.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.027
Look, I don't want to say it,
but what makes you think

04:37.061 --> 04:38.762
- he's still alive?
- He managed to dump

04:38.796 --> 04:40.797
his wallet and his phone,
so our best guess is Los Huesos

04:40.832 --> 04:42.199
don't know who he is yet.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.433
They're gonna press the hell out of him

04:43.468 --> 04:44.542
to find out who he's working for.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.702
BENSON: Exactly. Now,
Cruz is an ex-Ranger,

04:46.736 --> 04:48.772
SERE-trained to resist and survive,

04:48.806 --> 04:50.340
but the clock is ticking.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.808
We need to know
where Raul is keeping him.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.043
HONDO: So, what...

04:53.077 --> 04:55.812
you want Cortez to ask him?
In Mexico City?

04:55.847 --> 04:58.782
The Bureau's already run it
by your chief of police.

04:58.816 --> 05:00.323
If you sign off it,

05:00.358 --> 05:01.818
so will he.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.320
Wait, you're serious?

05:03.354 --> 05:06.523
You want her to go undercover
in gangland Mexico?

05:09.084 --> 05:10.560
<i>No way.</i>

05:10.595 --> 05:12.462
No way. This feels
way too rushed and sloppy.

05:12.497 --> 05:14.498
I'm the best shot Agent Cruz has.

05:14.532 --> 05:16.333
- You'd do the same in my shoes.
- Jessica,

05:16.367 --> 05:18.669
the FBI has a solid file on these guys.

05:18.703 --> 05:20.671
We run their leads,
and then we track them locally.

05:20.705 --> 05:22.506
Raul's men will cover their tracks.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.574
Fed's intel could be useless by now.

05:24.609 --> 05:26.209
You think you're gonna
just show up in Mexico

05:26.244 --> 05:27.878
and get a confession
on a wink and a smile?

05:28.603 --> 05:31.148
I realize you don't know
my work in the field.

05:31.182 --> 05:32.749
I'm not questioning your skills,

05:32.784 --> 05:35.919
but we are talking about
a high-risk op on foreign soil.

05:35.954 --> 05:38.355
You walk in there, I guarantee
you Raul is not gonna be

05:38.389 --> 05:40.424
the only lion in that den
that you have to worry about.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.526
I understand the risks.
It's been a few years,

05:42.560 --> 05:44.528
but I know exactly what I'm walking into.

05:44.562 --> 05:45.762
It's either that

05:45.797 --> 05:48.398
or do nothing and let Agent Cruz die.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.567
At the very least, bring backup.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.069
Someone who's got your six.

05:52.103 --> 05:54.905
Someone you can read
without words, and vice versa.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.594
CHRIS: <i>I'm in.</i>

05:56.628 --> 05:58.041
Whatever you need.

05:58.076 --> 05:59.606
Things are a lot messier down in Mexico.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.511
- I get it. I'm still in.
- HONDO: I knew you would be,

06:01.546 --> 06:03.246
so I already ran it up the chain.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.916
All right, listen up.
Raul knew Jessica as Alicia.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.418
Now, our story is the two of you
met in prison.

06:08.453 --> 06:11.421
Alicia did five years for the
same bust that put Raul away.

06:11.456 --> 06:12.789
- What was I in for?
- Manslaughter.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.925
Caught your boyfriend with another
woman, and you made him pay.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.126
Sounds like he had it coming.

06:16.127 --> 06:18.528
Nice, so you were, like,
Jessica's prison muscle.

06:18.596 --> 06:20.130
Shouldn't we send a fed instead?

06:20.164 --> 06:22.265
Someone who's spent time
embedded with guys like this?

06:22.300 --> 06:24.301
- You worried I can't do it?
- No, of course not.

06:24.335 --> 06:26.069
I'm just wondering what
the safest option might be.

06:26.835 --> 06:28.271
- I'll be fine.
- HONDO: The rest of us

06:28.306 --> 06:29.906
are gonna track this crew
right here in L.A.

06:29.941 --> 06:31.575
Now, we rescue Agent Cruz and then

06:31.609 --> 06:33.520
we get Chris and Jessica
on a plane and back home.

06:33.555 --> 06:35.479
I'll run known addresses
of Huesos members, see if we got

06:35.513 --> 06:37.080
anything in the system
the FBI doesn't have.

06:37.115 --> 06:38.815
I'll reach out to narcotics,
see what they have

06:38.850 --> 06:40.150
on the new drug these guys are pushing.

06:40.184 --> 06:42.219
HONDO: Great. Luca, Street,
dig into arrest records.

06:42.253 --> 06:43.742
See if we got anyone in custody
we can lean on.

06:43.776 --> 06:45.756
- All over it, boss.
- All right, let's get to it.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.257
Chris.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.294
Up here, Cortez is your captain,

06:51.329 --> 06:53.263
but down there, you're just two
cops doing whatever it takes

06:53.297 --> 06:54.731
to stay alive, you understand?

06:54.766 --> 06:55.966
And it's been a while since she's been

06:56.000 --> 06:57.234
- in the field.
- Exactly.

06:57.268 --> 06:59.102
I need you to stay sharp for both of you.

06:59.137 --> 07:00.999
Don't worry, boss, I... I got her back.

07:01.024 --> 07:02.113
I know you do.

07:03.141 --> 07:04.941
JESSICA: <i>Think of it this way:</i>

07:04.976 --> 07:07.310
the less you know, the
less you can worry about.

07:07.786 --> 07:10.647
I don't know, Jess. How dangerous is it?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.792
I'll let you know over a bottle
of wine when I get back.

07:14.385 --> 07:17.788
It's undercover work.
There's always risks,

07:17.822 --> 07:20.590
but I'm a cop
and I'm trained to handle it.

07:21.216 --> 07:23.460
I need to know you're okay with it.

07:23.494 --> 07:25.629
Listen, you say
you got to do it, I'm good.

07:25.663 --> 07:27.864
That doesn't mean it's fun
to be stuck outside the ropes

07:27.899 --> 07:30.434
when you-you can't even tell me
who you're in the ring fighting.

07:30.468 --> 07:33.136
I know. I'm sorry.

07:33.171 --> 07:35.105
I knew I was in trouble
the second I met you.

07:36.174 --> 07:37.340
Just be safe.

07:38.108 --> 07:39.509
HONDO: Captain.

07:39.544 --> 07:40.644
Hondo,

07:40.678 --> 07:42.379
this is David Arias.

07:42.413 --> 07:44.481
David, this is Hondo,
one of our SWAT team leaders.

07:44.515 --> 07:45.882
- Pleasure to meet you, David.
- Nice to meet you.

07:45.917 --> 07:47.150
Just want to let you know that Chris

07:47.185 --> 07:48.552
is all squared away and ready to roll.

07:48.586 --> 07:49.986
Oh, so this Chris guy is going with you?

07:50.021 --> 07:52.355
- She is. Yes.
- Oh, <i>she</i> is. Wow.

07:52.390 --> 07:54.265
I-I totally gender-assumed
there, didn't I?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.826
- Don't even sweat it, man.
- Got to say,

07:55.860 --> 07:57.494
I got a lot of respect
for what you guys do.

07:57.528 --> 08:00.497
I appreciate that. And Captain
Cortez here is one of our best.

08:00.531 --> 08:02.232
I believe it.

08:02.266 --> 08:03.834
- She's something else.
- Okay, guys.

08:03.868 --> 08:05.335
We're done here. I have a plane to catch.

08:05.369 --> 08:06.937
Thank you, Hondo.

08:18.049 --> 08:19.416
<i>And while most cops are clean,</i>

08:19.450 --> 08:21.084
<i>we have our share of dirty ones.</i>

08:21.119 --> 08:23.220
Best if no one knows you're in town.

08:23.653 --> 08:26.356
Raul's hacienda is nearby.

08:26.390 --> 08:28.992
I have a good view.
If you leave his place,

08:29.026 --> 08:31.394
check in here before going anywhere else.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.703
As long as the mission is on,

08:33.739 --> 08:37.900
these curtains stay closed.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.070
If you see them open
it means either Agent Cruz

08:40.104 --> 08:42.539
has been rescued
or we've aborted the mission.

08:42.573 --> 08:45.175
So if they're open, get out.

08:45.209 --> 08:47.878
Closed, stay put and maintain your cover.

08:47.912 --> 08:49.679
Any way to signal
from inside Raul's hacienda

08:49.714 --> 08:51.181
in case things go south?

08:53.558 --> 08:55.118
No.

08:55.153 --> 08:56.686
Once you're in, you're on your own.

08:56.721 --> 08:58.088
No weapons,

08:58.122 --> 09:01.525
no cell phones, and a wire is too risky.

09:01.559 --> 09:03.092
Be careful in there.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.628
Raul has dropped 30 bodies at least,

09:05.663 --> 09:07.898
but we can't prove it
because we can't find them.

09:07.932 --> 09:11.067
If something goes wrong, get out and run,

09:11.102 --> 09:13.370
and hope I get to you before he does.

We checked every hangout,

12:35.053 --> 12:36.582
Los Huesos have used
in the last six months

12:36.616 --> 12:38.329
and come up empty.
These guys have vanished.

12:38.330 --> 12:39.998
We've also compiled a list
of the gang's friends,

12:40.032 --> 12:41.533
relatives, but if we talk
to them, we might

12:41.567 --> 12:43.201
tip off Los Huesos that
Agent Cruz is one of us.

12:43.235 --> 12:45.503
We can't risk that.
I might have something.

12:45.538 --> 12:47.472
Hollywood Division Narcotics
says they've been tracking

12:47.506 --> 12:49.374
a house with some frat types,
new on the scene,

12:49.408 --> 12:51.042
pushing volume of a low-grade study drug

12:51.077 --> 12:53.211
- they're calling Lucidia.
- That's the stuff.

12:53.245 --> 12:54.279
Los Huesos have a few names for it,

12:54.313 --> 12:55.380
but Lucidia is one of them.

12:55.414 --> 12:56.681
If Hollywood's already onto these guys,

12:56.715 --> 12:58.450
then it won't look fishy
if we kicked their doors in.

Hell, the louder the better.

On the ground! Hands

- On the ground, right now!
- It's not ours.

13:14.105 --> 13:15.066
They came and dumped it on us.

13:15.101 --> 13:17.391
- Who did?
- Shut up, Ryan. We want lawyers.

you won't need a lawyer, you feel me?

thinking with a rat in the kitchen that

16:58.624 --> 17:00.558
their product was safer here

- Why?

17:23.082 --> 17:24.415
What's it to you?

17:24.450 --> 17:26.217
One of them killed my daughter

You wouldn't believe

17:28.687 --> 17:30.425
the pressure kids are under these days.

So she was taking something

Sir, they will pay for it,

17:37.963 --> 17:39.564
but right now,
we also need to get the guys

17:39.598 --> 17:41.332
who are pumping the poison
into our country.

17:41.367 --> 17:42.902
The guys that are supplying these losers.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.602
Yeah. They were here this morning.

17:44.636 --> 17:48.172
Latino guys. Unloaded a van
full of boxes and took off.

17:48.207 --> 17:49.907
Okay, wait a minute. You saw them?

17:49.942 --> 17:51.743
- Did you get a plate number?
- Dealer tags.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.286
But I followed them.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.115
They headed south and got off
the 710 at Del Amo.

17:57.149 --> 17:59.183
Headed into an area
that I couldn't follow

17:59.218 --> 18:00.790
in my Beemer, if you know what I mean.

18:00.824 --> 18:03.955
We're gonna need a description of
that van and anyone you saw in it.

JESSICA: <i>We need to get word back to L.A.</i>

18:06.352 --> 18:07.525
that agent Cruz is alive

18:07.559 --> 18:09.660
and Raul still doesn't know who he is.

18:09.695 --> 18:11.696
Sorry for pressing him like that.

18:11.730 --> 18:13.097
Raul can be sensitive.

18:13.132 --> 18:14.799
Best to let Alicia handle him.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.601
She's quite the firecracker, Alicia.

18:16.635 --> 18:18.102
You like her?

18:18.137 --> 18:20.165
I do. Certainly a side
I didn't see coming.

18:22.141 --> 18:23.674
Let's go up.

ROMERO: <i>Good to hear that
Agent Cruz is still alive,</i>

18:26.645 --> 18:28.513
but this Chato thing is a problem.

18:28.547 --> 18:31.015
Raul won't just kill him,
he'll make a show of it

18:31.049 --> 18:32.517
to set an example.

18:32.551 --> 18:34.051
What if we say we can't find him?

18:34.086 --> 18:36.120
We can't go back empty-handed.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.389
That won't fly with Raul.
Like he said, it's a test.

18:38.424 --> 18:41.192
If you think it's too risky, don't do it.

18:41.226 --> 18:43.895
I know how serious
you take a missing cop,

18:43.929 --> 18:46.030
but losing two more in Mexico
won't make it any better.

18:47.109 --> 18:48.566
What if we kill him?

18:49.111 --> 18:50.201
Raul?

18:50.235 --> 18:52.537
No. Chato.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.781

19:00.806 --> 19:02.807

What do we have on that van?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.321
Grieving father saw the van
exit a freeway

19:04.346 --> 19:05.680
near Rancho Dominquez.

19:05.714 --> 19:07.638
That's out of the way
and a good spot to lay low.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.798
Central Vice has some
UCs keeping eyes out,

19:09.832 --> 19:11.966
but that's a lot of ground to
canvass without drawing attention.

19:12.001 --> 19:13.668
And with Chris and Cortez embedded,

19:13.703 --> 19:15.203
the last thing we want
is to tip Los Huesos

19:15.237 --> 19:16.471
that we're looking for them.

19:16.505 --> 19:18.039
Just got word from Romero.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.108
Your officers have confirmed
that Cruz is still alive

19:20.142 --> 19:22.392
and Los Huesos have
no idea who he is yet.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.312
- Great, so we bringing them home?
- Well, not yet.

19:24.347 --> 19:26.281
Raul has sent them
on some kind of a task.

19:26.315 --> 19:27.882
Says if they prove themselves

19:27.917 --> 19:29.617
he'll let them in on the whole
L.A. operation.

19:29.652 --> 19:31.720
- What kind of task?
- I...

19:31.754 --> 19:33.688
STREET: But they've confirmed
that Cruz is still alive,

19:33.723 --> 19:35.790
and we know the part of town
that he's probably being held.

19:35.825 --> 19:37.892
I mean, is it really worth the
risk of leaving them down there?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.494
HONDO: All right, look, we
all want to bring them back

19:39.528 --> 19:41.129
as soon as possible, but Benson's right.

19:41.163 --> 19:42.897
We pull them out now,
it could look suspicious.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.964
They maintain their covers
until we get Agent Cruz back.

19:44.998 --> 19:46.000

(SHORT LAUGH)

20:04.120 --> 20:05.553

20:44.560 --> 20:47.262
What happened? You shoot him for real?

20:47.296 --> 20:48.696
CHRIS: He tried to run
at the last minute.

20:48.731 --> 20:50.398
I had to get a little physical.

20:56.572 --> 20:59.908
ROMERO: I'll have someone come get him.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.244
I hope you two know what you're doing.

21:08.951 --> 21:10.452
David Arias. Yeah.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.296
Yeah, yeah, he's good. Send him back.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.656
You good, Street?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.391
You got any idea how many cops

21:16.425 --> 21:18.326
have been killed in
Mexico this year alone?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.829
I don't think that's something you
need to be focused on right now.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.997
I just, I hate the feeling
like we got family

21:23.032 --> 21:24.566
in the battlefield,
and there's not a damn thing

21:24.600 --> 21:26.167
- that we can do to help.
- Hey.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.270
We are helping. We have UCs
combing the streets,

21:29.305 --> 21:30.839
we have every CI in town getting grilled,

21:30.873 --> 21:33.408
and once we even get a whiff
of intel, it's game on.

21:34.109 --> 21:36.444
And I'm gonna need everyone
to be razor sharp and rested.

21:36.479 --> 21:38.913
I don't know, it's just
like, give me a job to do?

21:38.948 --> 21:40.748
I don't care how dangerous
it is, I'll get it done.

21:40.783 --> 21:42.223
But this sitting on our hands crap...

21:42.257 --> 21:43.818
It's real easy to get lost

21:43.853 --> 21:45.487
with the things that you can't control.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.355
But we know that Chris
and Jessica are safe

21:47.389 --> 21:49.424
at the moment,
and they have the trust of Raul.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.993
They're gonna send us some intel
soon, so I'm gonna need you

21:52.027 --> 21:53.428
to find something else to focus on,

21:53.462 --> 21:54.829
something to keep you positive.

21:54.864 --> 21:56.423
- All right.
- DAVID: Hondo.

21:57.199 --> 21:58.500
David.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.001
Hey. Everything all right?

22:00.035 --> 22:01.536
Yeah, yeah. Thanks. I got it.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.037
Thanks for letting me drop in. I just,

22:03.072 --> 22:04.606
I just can't figure out
what to do with myself.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.140
Look, I'm not the prying type,

22:06.175 --> 22:07.876
but it's hard to feel
so far out of the loop.

22:08.449 --> 22:10.383
Know the feeling.

22:11.689 --> 22:13.214
I'm going for a run.

22:14.024 --> 22:15.383
I guess I was just hoping
you could tell me

22:15.417 --> 22:18.082
- if you've heard from her.
- She sent a message to us.

22:18.116 --> 22:19.979
It sounds like everything
is going as planned.

22:20.013 --> 22:21.956
Man, I don't know why I'm so wound up.

22:21.991 --> 22:23.691
Well, dating a cop's never an easy thing.

22:24.179 --> 22:26.380
You ever date anyone on the force?

22:27.329 --> 22:28.630
Couple times.

22:28.664 --> 22:30.164
At least as a cop,
you know you measure up well.

22:30.199 --> 22:31.699
Hey, come on, man. I don't think you have

22:31.734 --> 22:33.635
- to worry about all that.
- Well, usually, I don't,

22:33.669 --> 22:35.470
but Jessica's different, man.

22:35.504 --> 22:37.805
Look, I know it sucks
being left in the dark,

22:37.840 --> 22:39.974
but she will be home before you know it.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.178
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.921
CHARICE: You realize it's past midnight?

22:52.955 --> 22:56.090
Mama, by morning, this is all
gonna be good as new. (CHUCKLES)

22:56.125 --> 22:58.826
So, you want to tell me
what's going on at work,

22:58.861 --> 23:00.728
or is this something else?

23:00.763 --> 23:03.932
You only start these little
projects when you're spinning

23:03.966 --> 23:05.867
and need to feel
like you can fix something.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.535
(CHUCKLES) I don't know, I...

23:08.037 --> 23:09.747
I'm just restless, that's all.

23:10.406 --> 23:13.408
Are you still seeing that girl, the ADA?

23:14.043 --> 23:17.512
No. No, that, uh, that
kind of went south.

23:17.546 --> 23:19.213
But it was never really
a permanent thing, anyway.

23:19.248 --> 23:20.615
(SCOFFS) Are they ever?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.050
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

23:22.084 --> 23:23.618
Well, it's just that, sometimes,

23:23.652 --> 23:26.020
I feel like I've raised you to be

23:26.055 --> 23:28.089
- a little bit too independent.
- Okay, Mama,

23:28.123 --> 23:30.031
I don't think girl trouble's
what's messing with me.

23:30.066 --> 23:32.260
Well, you spinning about something.

23:34.396 --> 23:37.191
(CHUCKLES) All right, I...

23:37.800 --> 23:40.602
I just feel like I can never do enough,

23:40.636 --> 23:42.470
like nothing ever changes.

23:43.072 --> 23:44.405
Some of it won't.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.374
There's always gonna be
another racist cop

23:46.909 --> 23:48.476
like that one in Arizona.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.813
A pervert like the one
that went after your sister.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.966
Never gonna get 'em all,

23:54.001 --> 23:57.358
but big picture, things change.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.420

41:39.611 --> 41:42.212
Oh, Mama's love doesn't count.

41:42.237 --> 41:45.806
It's too blind, and I'm
not gonna be here forever.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.201
Yeah, well, for a blind lady,

41:47.236 --> 41:49.045
you sure are picking up
on a lot of flaws.

41:49.079 --> 41:53.841
Not flaws, just bumps in the road.

41:55.677 --> 41:58.246
I just wish I knew what was causing 'em.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.876
You'll figure it out.

42:00.515 --> 42:02.336
Maybe not on your own.

42:02.905 --> 42:06.307
There's a lot of people who'd be
happy to help you over 'em,

42:06.788 --> 42:08.222
when you're ready.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.889
I love you.

42:13.042 --> 42:14.682
