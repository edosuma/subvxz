<i>- Previously on</i> Star...
- But the police will find

00:04.360 --> 00:06.560
- whoever did this, or I will.
- Next tour is all you.

00:06.637 --> 00:07.903
- Next summer?
- Try next month.

00:07.928 --> 00:09.418
My ex-business partner.

00:09.575 --> 00:11.266
I need you to find
out their next move.

00:11.341 --> 00:12.894

open for Noah.

00:12.919 --> 00:15.347
I am in no condition to
pursue this guardianship.

00:15.372 --> 00:17.439
- How long do you think I have?
- Another week.

00:17.464 --> 00:20.288

- I pronounce you husband and wife.

were taking Karen away.</i>

00:28.795 --> 00:30.998

03:01.770 --> 03:03.399
Start riding into work with me.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.496
Easy, champ. I'm just
staying with you

03:07.521 --> 03:09.465
'cause there ain't
no room at Ruby's.

03:09.808 --> 03:11.140
Oh, is that all?

03:11.302 --> 03:13.766
Ooh.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.493
I'll see you at the Sound
House meeting later.

03:17.977 --> 03:20.615
The girls are hyped up about
landing a A-list promoter.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.040
Oh, well, they ain't
landed him yet.

03:22.064 --> 03:24.318
They want to meet with the
talent to get a feel for them.

03:24.574 --> 03:26.497
Now, if they're impressed
enough to sign them on,

03:26.522 --> 03:28.012
this tour's gonna be next level.

03:28.235 --> 03:30.635
Look at you. You as hungry
for this as they are.

03:30.748 --> 03:33.416
Hey, Charles needs to leave the
day-to-day in somebody's hands.

03:33.701 --> 03:35.460
I ain't mad at you.

03:36.797 --> 03:38.741
Looks like the rebuild's
coming along.

03:39.326 --> 03:42.178
Yeah. Everyone in the whole
neighborhood is helping out.

03:43.155 --> 03:44.587
Feels good to be appreciated.

03:44.798 --> 03:46.212
Drilling's got to
be done by 6:00,

03:46.237 --> 03:47.770
or Carlotta will get
noise complaints.

03:48.508 --> 03:50.959
It's finally starting
to feel like old times.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.062
Well, well. You're here
to volunteer, right?

03:59.902 --> 04:02.294
What you need me
to do, light skin?

04:05.359 --> 04:07.310
Or do I just get
in where I fit in?

04:07.528 --> 04:09.928
Look, this is not the time to...
put this on.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.088
What am I supposed
to do with this?

04:13.113 --> 04:14.267
Put it on.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.505
I'm not wearing that.

04:21.144 --> 04:23.322
You and Maurice are
getting pretty serious.

04:24.228 --> 04:26.658
- Stay out of grown folks' business.
- I'm just saying,

04:26.683 --> 04:28.883
you've been staying at
his house a lot, Miss C.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.060
Looks good.

04:31.802 --> 04:35.045
Simone, you got a letter
from the County Clerk.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.149
That was fast.

04:37.174 --> 04:38.907
We just sent in the
work release papers.

04:39.064 --> 04:40.089
Yeah.

04:43.424 --> 04:44.881
What's the matter? Why
are you acting funny?

04:44.905 --> 04:45.995
I'm not.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.852
Yeah, you are. What's wrong?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.739
Okay. So, I got scared
when they told us

04:53.774 --> 04:56.275
we weren't going on tour, and
Ayanna said I had one week

04:56.310 --> 04:58.357
until I had to go back to
juvie, so I did something.

04:59.139 --> 05:00.451
What did you do?

05:02.746 --> 05:03.855
I got married.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.381
- Married?
- Oh... girl.

05:06.754 --> 05:10.444
She didn't get married. To who?
The ghost of Karen?

05:11.027 --> 05:12.327
Really?

05:14.791 --> 05:15.890
Oh, my God.

05:16.523 --> 05:18.097
You married Angel?

05:18.122 --> 05:20.110
Why the hell would you go
and do something like that?

05:20.134 --> 05:22.145
You're 17. You ain't got
no business being married.

05:22.170 --> 05:23.654
Okay, what else was
I supposed to do?

05:23.679 --> 05:25.005
I had to protect myself.

05:25.424 --> 05:26.726
What if the tour falls through?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.784
My ass would've been sent
back to that hellhole.

05:28.809 --> 05:29.885
The tour is real.

05:29.910 --> 05:31.810
Yeah, just like Ayanna
being my guardian?

05:32.146 --> 05:34.439
What's Angel getting
out of this?

05:34.464 --> 05:36.034
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

05:36.059 --> 05:37.260
Exactly what I just said.

05:37.285 --> 05:38.451
Look, I'm finally free.

05:38.476 --> 05:40.363
- Please be happy for me.
- Oh, my goodness. Dear Lord,

05:40.387 --> 05:41.832
please smack some
sense into this girl

05:41.856 --> 05:43.543
- before I have to.
- It's only six months.

05:43.568 --> 05:45.660
As soon as I turn 18, we're
getting a divorce, so...

05:47.573 --> 05:49.089
I'm tired of your secrets.

05:49.222 --> 05:51.612
Well, I learned from the best.

05:53.334 --> 05:54.356
Cott.

05:54.589 --> 05:56.074
You would've been
my maid of honor.

05:59.949 --> 06:01.738
We're not done with this
marriage discussion.

06:01.763 --> 06:03.029
I-I feel like we are.

06:03.054 --> 06:04.832
Hello?

06:07.148 --> 06:08.218
Oh.

06:14.022 --> 06:15.108
Arlene?

06:16.529 --> 06:19.109
No. Charlene.

06:19.231 --> 06:20.523
Charlene Zimmer.

06:20.860 --> 06:24.195
I'm Arlene's sister and I'm
looking for Star Davis.

06:25.293 --> 06:26.446
For what?

06:28.035 --> 06:29.376
I'm Star.

06:30.444 --> 06:31.949
Hunter had very good taste.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.097
You're very pretty.

06:35.215 --> 06:36.475
What you want?

06:37.949 --> 06:40.512
Well, I've been here for two
weeks trying to find out

06:40.548 --> 06:41.869
about my sister's death.

06:42.538 --> 06:43.963
Police don't know anything.

06:45.008 --> 06:48.084
Her body was found in
a quarry off I-75.

06:48.189 --> 06:51.458
She'd been dead for a month.
Stabbed.

06:52.059 --> 06:55.132
I promise you, she'll
never bother you again.

06:55.163 --> 06:56.367
They say it was brutal.

06:59.524 --> 07:01.702
Do any of you know anybody

07:02.536 --> 07:04.581
who would kill my sister?

07:06.448 --> 07:08.175
Nah. I'm sorry.

07:10.859 --> 07:11.948
I don't know nothing.

07:20.557 --> 07:21.581
Wow.

07:21.834 --> 07:24.745
Brody, I need you to call me
back right now. This is serious.

07:29.172 --> 07:30.438
Girl, what'd he do now?

07:31.476 --> 07:33.382
I think he killed Arlene.

07:33.632 --> 07:35.205
Girl, no, he didn't.
Stop saying that.

07:35.230 --> 07:37.164
He did. He did.

07:38.539 --> 07:40.386
He came around here,
like, a month ago.

07:41.152 --> 07:42.573
Blood all over his face.

07:43.183 --> 07:47.088
He told me, "You don't have to
worry about Arlene anymore."

07:47.615 --> 07:49.346
Now that woman is dead.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.441
Handsome white men do always turn out
to be those crazy serial killers.

07:56.622 --> 07:58.403
What? I be watching
them crime shows.

07:58.677 --> 07:59.833
I'm being serious.

08:00.161 --> 08:01.817
I know Brody did this.

08:02.069 --> 08:03.794
Okay, maybe you're right...

08:03.819 --> 08:05.624
Sorry to interrupt.

08:06.491 --> 08:08.452
I didn't mean to upset anybody.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.933
If you... if you
remember anything or...

08:14.005 --> 08:16.091
see anything, give me a call.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.877
Please, Ms. Davis.

08:22.077 --> 08:23.124
You, too.

08:24.093 --> 08:25.188
Thank you.

08:29.659 --> 08:31.019
Oh, my God.

08:31.152 --> 08:32.924
Of course she's a mortician.

08:34.378 --> 08:35.760
So, she do hair?

08:36.094 --> 08:38.688
Okay. All right.
Let's go inside.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.791
If you know anything

08:40.816 --> 08:43.402
about who may have killed
my sister, Arlene Morgan,

08:43.437 --> 08:46.544
I urge you to do the right
thing and come forward.

08:46.637 --> 08:47.840
This ain't going away.

08:48.809 --> 08:51.376
Like I said, I was
protecting Star and I...

08:51.412 --> 08:53.045
You weren't supposed
to kill the bitch!

08:53.080 --> 08:54.947
The cops found the
body two weeks ago.

08:54.982 --> 08:57.179
- They have nothing.
- I ain't talking about the cops.

08:57.318 --> 08:59.306
Her damn twin is
all over the news.

08:59.687 --> 09:01.377
Look, I was careful. All right?

09:01.869 --> 09:03.655
They don't have any
trace of me or you.

09:03.691 --> 09:06.125
Me? Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:06.603 --> 09:09.094
I ain't touch her, you did.
This is all on you.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.527
They're not gonna find out.
Trust me.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.402
You hear me.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.802
For once, I finally got
something going good,

09:16.837 --> 09:18.820
and I ain't about to let your
sloppy mistake come back

09:18.844 --> 09:20.376
and bite me in the
ass, you hear that?

09:20.401 --> 09:21.876

10:15.469 --> 10:17.062

10:17.097 --> 10:19.063

Yeah, she keep me in check.

10:23.771 --> 10:25.571
She can't even keep her
own mama in check.

10:25.606 --> 10:27.439
Yeah.

10:27.474 --> 10:28.780
You know the streets talking.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.142
Saying that you fell off.

10:30.177 --> 10:31.702
Saying you got dropped
from the label.

10:32.439 --> 10:35.073
Me being the opening act,
everybody asking me questions.

10:35.325 --> 10:36.548
I held it down, though.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.817
Yeah, I appreciate that.

10:39.466 --> 10:41.453
Well, look, I'm gonna let
you get back to it, man.

10:41.488 --> 10:42.955
♪ Doin' shows on the road... ♪

10:42.990 --> 10:44.790
- All right.
- Yeah.

10:45.438 --> 10:46.961
That'll be good.

10:46.986 --> 10:48.922
Hey, run that back from the top.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.561
And bring that last part back.

10:53.067 --> 10:54.936
- Married?
- Yes, married. Two weeks.

10:54.968 --> 10:56.907
- Is this true? Hey, is this true?
- Two weeks.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.056
You got a problem with that?

10:58.081 --> 10:59.981
Yeah, I got a problem
with that, man.

11:00.006 --> 11:01.703
- I thought she was gay.
- Shut up, Andy.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.261
If you try to take
advantage of her, you know

11:03.285 --> 11:04.452
- what I'll do to you, right?
- Hey, Star, stop.

11:04.476 --> 11:05.719
I respect her more than that.

11:07.047 --> 11:08.336
So she's not gay?

11:08.361 --> 11:10.289
- What are you talking about?
- You need to stop!

11:10.314 --> 11:12.273
Guys, guys! The Sound House rep

11:12.298 --> 11:14.547
- will be here any minute. Y'all ready?
- Yes.

11:14.712 --> 11:17.633
I'll be ready, soon as you tell
me why Quavo's in my studio.

11:17.673 --> 11:18.773
Quavo? What?

11:18.894 --> 11:20.425
- Like Quavo Quavo?
- Scoot, scoot.

11:20.450 --> 11:23.714
Yeah he's with Floyd Entertainment.
He'll just be here a couple of days

11:26.393 --> 11:27.909
All right.

11:28.568 --> 11:29.612
I'm parched, actually.

11:29.637 --> 11:31.766
Look, I need y'all to
focus on Sound House.

11:31.948 --> 11:33.664
- Focused.
- Right in here.

11:34.671 --> 11:36.499
Ms. Desmond. Have a seat.

11:36.524 --> 11:37.535
Thank you.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.452
Please meet the artists
of the Noah Brooks tour.

11:39.477 --> 11:41.944
- And their managers.
- Jahil Rivera.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.934
Manager by day,
hustler by night.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.176
This job is your midlife crisis.

11:46.445 --> 11:48.279
Wow! She did her homework.

11:48.813 --> 11:50.646
Um, I'm Carlotta Brown.

11:50.823 --> 11:52.176
I manage Take Three.

11:52.826 --> 11:54.985
Ms. Desmond, my girls
are rising stars

11:55.010 --> 11:56.852
with a rapidly growing fan base.

11:56.963 --> 11:58.274
A tour with Sound House

11:58.299 --> 12:00.099
- would be next level.
- I know.

12:00.401 --> 12:01.993
Uh, which is why I'm here.

12:02.466 --> 12:06.305
One thing I don't like to do is
deliver bad news over the phone.

12:06.363 --> 12:07.378
Bad news?

12:07.403 --> 12:09.670
I fought for Sound House
to back this tour.

12:10.045 --> 12:11.204
I fought for you, Noah.

12:11.763 --> 12:14.415
But ultimately, my company
sees you as a risk.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.424
You're a hotheaded
headliner, and no one else

12:16.449 --> 12:18.682
on this marquee can pick up
the slack should you fail.

12:18.756 --> 12:19.809
Wha... Wait, what?

12:19.834 --> 12:21.639
All right, but you've got us.

12:21.944 --> 12:23.675
Have you not listened
to any of our music?

12:23.700 --> 12:25.519
- I have. You're good.
- Listen, I...

12:25.640 --> 12:27.867
- I'm-I'm sober now.
- Yeah, one bad move,

12:28.593 --> 12:29.953
you're off the wagon...

12:30.363 --> 12:33.194
When we send out an artist,
it's a big investment.

12:33.293 --> 12:34.772
Without a guaranteed success,

12:35.421 --> 12:37.502
there is no tour
with Sound House.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.734
A guarantee like Quavo?

12:45.721 --> 12:47.360
What if Quavo headlines for us?

12:48.649 --> 12:50.990
Well, then we would have
something to discuss.

12:51.453 --> 12:54.254
- Okay. Okay.
- He's in the building, right?

13:00.834 --> 13:02.512
He loved my idea, right?

13:05.988 --> 13:08.221
- Andy, stop lying to yourself!
- Star.

13:08.639 --> 13:10.040
Star.

13:11.369 --> 13:12.392
What?

13:14.041 --> 13:16.480
Are you that pissed over Alex
that you would stoop this low?

13:17.053 --> 13:18.147
Wh-Why would you do that?

13:18.491 --> 13:21.179
'Cause I'm not trying to lose this tour.
What are you talking about?

13:21.540 --> 13:23.071
Why are you letting
us get in the way?

13:23.602 --> 13:24.621
What is "us"?

13:25.573 --> 13:28.346
You showed up in my life at
a time that I needed you.

13:28.694 --> 13:30.061
We were there for each other.

13:30.396 --> 13:32.095
But you clearly didn't need me.

13:32.131 --> 13:33.430
So I've moved on.

13:33.654 --> 13:35.865
Alex has moved on,
and now you need to.

13:36.576 --> 13:38.268
So you're saying
after all this time,

13:38.304 --> 13:39.903
you-you feel nothing for me?

13:42.414 --> 13:44.915
This is my chance.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.771
You're messed up, Star.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.447
Yeah, I've heard that.

14:01.663 --> 14:04.023
Hey, nephew. Can I talk
at you for a minute?

14:04.819 --> 14:05.857
What's up?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.266
I mean, you do know
she's an addict, right?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.636
Are you really calling
somebody an addict right now?

14:12.974 --> 14:15.083
- Come on.
- Man...

14:16.044 --> 14:18.138
How come you didn't come
talk to me about this first?

14:18.785 --> 14:20.356
'Cause there was
nothing to talk about.

14:20.813 --> 14:22.513
She needed my help,
so I helped her.

14:22.789 --> 14:24.438
I mean, do you even like her?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.685
Mm.

14:29.542 --> 14:30.689
You like her, huh?

14:30.848 --> 14:31.899
You're my manager.

14:31.924 --> 14:34.449
- Okay? Not my dad.
- Oh, yeah? Are you sure

14:34.474 --> 14:36.964
it's that simple? 'Cause
let me tell you something.

14:36.989 --> 14:38.238

you need help landing
Sound House.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.767
You know this your last shot
at getting back on top, right?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.329
Here. That way.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.166

18:53.551 --> 18:55.041

- Say, bruh, I'm good.

19:05.397 --> 19:07.148

<i>Hey, Maurice!</i>

19:14.733 --> 19:16.249
The hell you thinking, man?

19:31.978 --> 19:33.306
From what I know...

19:34.567 --> 19:38.468
the problem with your last tour
started with the drinking...

19:39.820 --> 19:43.277
then the drugs, and ended with
you punching a label president.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.816
Don't do it.

19:49.591 --> 19:51.992
You know, I worked my ass
off to win that showcase.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.026

19:54.734 --> 19:56.307

19:57.950 --> 19:59.083

19:59.517 --> 20:00.982
ain't the answer.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.814

me about Arlene?

So you didn't have
nothing to do with it?

20:49.167 --> 20:51.255
I did what I had to
do to protect you.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.088
You kill my mama to
protect me, too?

21:05.028 --> 21:07.208
I need to know what happened
the night my mother died.

21:07.251 --> 21:10.418
- You know what happened.
- No. All I have is pieces.

21:10.677 --> 21:12.800
I have pieces in my
head like a puzzle.

21:13.136 --> 21:15.293
And I'm trying to figure it
out, and I need your help.

21:16.186 --> 21:17.730
You got to help
me figure it out.

21:18.519 --> 21:20.242
Your mother overdosed, Star.

21:20.535 --> 21:21.576
That's the truth.

21:21.612 --> 21:23.111
No, the truth is
that you're crazy.

21:23.147 --> 21:25.147
And you passed that
gene on to me.

21:25.323 --> 21:26.748
Okay? It's in my DNA.

21:26.784 --> 21:29.222
Whatever is wrong with
you is wrong with me.

21:30.151 --> 21:32.587
I have done horrible
things to people.

21:34.826 --> 21:38.338
Whatever happened that
night with Mama, I saw it.

21:38.455 --> 21:39.551
And it messed me up.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.332
You grabbed me by the
shoulders, right?

21:44.129 --> 21:46.121
- You were shaking me.
- Don't say a word.

21:46.364 --> 21:47.830
You told me not to tell anybody.

21:47.946 --> 21:49.907
"Never tell anybody. This
is our little secret."

21:50.052 --> 21:51.805
Well, what was our
little secret?

21:52.722 --> 21:54.431
I should never even
have been there.

21:58.872 --> 22:02.012
Carlotta says I didn't speak
for two weeks after Mama died.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.676
Why?

22:05.355 --> 22:07.028
Don't do this. Please.

22:07.591 --> 22:09.624
Tell me what happened right now!

22:09.931 --> 22:11.077
Please.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.611
I am begging you!

22:18.066 --> 22:19.081
No.

22:26.778 --> 22:27.965
You're a coward.

22:28.712 --> 22:30.106
I never want to see you again.

22:31.122 --> 22:33.359

When my work visa expired,
I-I decided to stay anyway.

23:59.997 --> 24:01.856
I ran one red light,

24:02.239 --> 24:05.440
and got pulled over, and...
and they deported me.

24:06.833 --> 24:09.246
I wanted a better life
for you, so I lied

24:09.271 --> 24:11.728

that he's joining the tour,

25:14.220 --> 25:16.063

trending big-time.

- What?

Hey, hold on, hold on.
Hey, we're going up.

25:21.580 --> 25:23.113
I'm right here with Alex Crane.

25:23.867 --> 25:25.445
Hey, man. Chill out
with all that, man.

25:25.470 --> 25:27.032
She ain't no joint to
be passing around, bro.

25:27.056 --> 25:28.100
You know I'm just playing.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.112
All right, well, you guys
just keep playing then.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.865
Y'all see this dude over here
catching feelings already, man.

25:33.890 --> 25:35.189
- Look at him.
- Watch out, man.

25:35.461 --> 25:37.044
Hey, bruh, you better
chill out, bro.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.669
Well, you know what
happened last time.

25:38.732 --> 25:40.098
What you need to worry about

25:40.123 --> 25:41.989
is keeping your eye on
your girl over there.

25:43.137 --> 25:44.789
I'd love to have a dip
in that chocolate.

25:44.925 --> 25:45.930
What?

25:47.156 --> 25:48.838
Noah.

25:48.933 --> 25:51.236
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
R-Relax, man.

25:51.261 --> 25:53.181
- Hey, relax.
- You're gonna pull out a gun, bro?

25:53.206 --> 25:54.455
Hey, hey, we don't
need to do all this.

25:54.479 --> 25:55.501
Oh, yeah?

25:56.158 --> 25:57.172
Hmm?

25:57.849 --> 25:59.047
Put the gun down.

26:00.129 --> 26:01.313
We all good.

26:02.224 --> 26:03.338
I'm good.

26:04.334 --> 26:05.400
You ain't.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.330
- I'm out.
- Hey, hold on a second.

26:07.355 --> 26:08.887
- Quavo.
- Nah, nah, nah.

26:09.295 --> 26:11.253
You need me. I don't need you.

26:11.761 --> 26:14.433
And I damn sure don't need
this wack-ass B-level tour.

26:15.828 --> 26:17.019
Good luck.

26:37.962 --> 26:39.720
What the hell was that about?

26:41.192 --> 26:42.750
What the hell was that?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.188
What you mean? He the one
that pulled out the gun.

26:45.213 --> 26:47.536
You ain't even on tour yet, and
you already picking fights.

26:47.561 --> 26:49.653
Whatever. Quavo was
disrespecting Alex.

26:49.678 --> 26:51.010
Ain't nobody buying that.

26:51.513 --> 26:52.741
You need to wake up.

26:52.766 --> 26:54.700
91% of musicians

26:54.725 --> 26:56.825
are completely unknown,
and here you are,

26:57.263 --> 26:59.987
you're not chasing the dream no more...
You are the dream.

27:00.239 --> 27:02.191
- And you got a lot more to gain.
- Do I?

27:03.165 --> 27:05.692
Every corner I turn, somebody's
trying to remind me of the past,

27:05.717 --> 27:07.223
or telling me I
ain't good enough.

27:12.420 --> 27:13.800
I'm gonna be straight with you.

27:15.195 --> 27:16.760
You're saying that to yourself.

27:17.284 --> 27:18.917
So what's really going on?

27:19.421 --> 27:21.566
That's what I keep
asking myself every day.

27:23.792 --> 27:26.202
Look, this tour is gonna be
everything it should be.

27:26.885 --> 27:29.546
- It's crucial for all of us.
- There ain't no more tour.

27:29.571 --> 27:30.921
You let me worry about that.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.421
I know how bad I want it.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.540
I know how bad you want it, too.

27:34.982 --> 27:35.985
Noah,

27:37.375 --> 27:38.610
man up.

27:48.695 --> 27:50.598
It's Star. Leave a message.

27:50.623 --> 27:51.695
Hey, Star.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.480
It's me.

27:54.190 --> 27:56.754
Look, you were right, and
I'm gonna be leaving now.

27:57.489 --> 27:58.707
For real this time.

27:59.705 --> 28:00.957
I've done enough damage.

28:02.629 --> 28:04.110
Tell Simone I said
good-bye, okay?

28:20.758 --> 28:23.367
Whatever it is, I bet I got
a story that can beat it.

28:26.607 --> 28:28.178
You make me happy, Simone.

28:29.311 --> 28:31.623
Wow, no one's ever said
that to me before.

28:32.245 --> 28:33.246
Thanks.

28:37.375 --> 28:38.468
What happened?

28:38.493 --> 28:40.155
She dipped on me and
never looked back.

28:41.043 --> 28:42.163
That's what happened.

28:42.913 --> 28:45.327
Yeah, but she's here now, and
she's worried about you.

28:46.706 --> 28:49.199
She wasn't worried about me when
I was living with that monster

28:49.224 --> 28:50.424
for all those years.

28:51.888 --> 28:53.803
I find out he's not
even my father.

28:54.968 --> 28:56.928
And I'm an undocumented
immigrant.

28:57.961 --> 28:59.020
Yeah, well, uh...

28:59.935 --> 29:02.497
Well, I've... I've got
worse stories, so...

29:08.970 --> 29:10.761
She said she was
gonna send for me.

29:13.176 --> 29:14.434
She never did.

29:14.648 --> 29:15.973
She said she was gonna call.

29:17.067 --> 29:18.387
She never did.

29:21.671 --> 29:23.718
I just don't want to
hurt anymore, Simone.

29:25.635 --> 29:27.461
I won't let that happen.

29:29.187 --> 29:30.959
Sometimes people change.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.529
Sometimes they don't.

29:36.736 --> 29:38.190
Hey, Angel.

29:40.978 --> 29:43.009
Don't let her leave
without saying good-bye.

29:44.607 --> 29:45.892
'Cause you'll regret it.

29:54.312 --> 29:55.409
Are you ready to play?

29:57.127 --> 29:58.424
I'm gonna beat you.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.661
Okay.

30:03.994 --> 30:06.127
Before you give up on
the tour, hear me out.

30:07.197 --> 30:08.502
Give us a minute, please?

30:09.376 --> 30:10.393
Sorry.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.705
What if you find
another promoter?

30:15.969 --> 30:17.569
- Someone local.
- Uh, Carlotta, it...

30:17.807 --> 30:19.584
Look, we got a loyal fan base.

30:19.809 --> 30:21.148
Atlanta loves these artists.

30:21.175 --> 30:23.876
If we can show Sound House that
we can pack them regionally,

30:24.247 --> 30:25.806
then nationally, we got a shot.

30:28.017 --> 30:29.017
All right.

30:29.052 --> 30:30.551
I'll reach out to a
regional promoter

30:30.576 --> 30:32.524
- I know from back in the day.
- All we got to do

30:32.549 --> 30:35.223
is prove that we can sell
out a show without Quavo.

30:35.258 --> 30:37.403
You really think you can
sell out a show last-minute?

30:37.754 --> 30:38.760

Yo, I can't believe

32:06.675 --> 32:08.389
Quavo's six million
followers are looking

32:08.414 --> 32:09.818
at the flyer for
our show tonight.

32:09.843 --> 32:12.179

from the night that mama died.

41:21.340 --> 41:22.699
And I understand now.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.849
You were looking out for me.

41:27.070 --> 41:29.103
You were trying to protect me.

41:29.139 --> 41:31.630
Don't worry about what you
think you remember, okay?

41:32.310 --> 41:33.771
You were right.

41:34.818 --> 41:36.524
I killed Arlene.

42:07.652 --> 42:08.966

42:12.982 --> 42:15.950
Don't you just love a good bath?

42:21.324 --> 42:23.191
Your sister raised a monster

42:23.402 --> 42:25.207
and stood by him
while he beat her.

42:25.895 --> 42:27.832
She wanted to destroy Star.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.223
You think that's a kind person?

42:30.633 --> 42:32.098
She was an evil bitch.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.321
And what does that make you?

42:51.087 --> 42:52.395
See you.
