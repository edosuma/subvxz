Oh.

Ah!
Cacti for the win.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.656
( puppies yipping )

00:57.658 --> 01:00.325
Ah! Out of the way!
I overslept.

01:00.327 --> 01:01.660
I'm gonna be late.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.164
Ah, where's my hoodie?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.566
Whoa, chill, Marco.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.568
We can still get to school
by first period.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.904
This isn't about learning.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.239
This is about  <i>love.</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:17.209
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>I get there by 7:55,</i>

01:17.211 --> 01:21.814
<i>because at exactly 7:56,</i>
<i>Jackie Lynn Thomas gets there.</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:24.883
And we share a nod.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.618
It's kind of our thing.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.588
( sighs )

01:29.590 --> 01:31.156
Aww.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.724
Wait, a nod?

01:32.726 --> 01:33.992
You don't even say hi?

01:33.994 --> 01:35.828
I'm working up to that.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.630
See, it's all a part
of my 23-step plan.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.266
I'm already on step 4:
Nodding every day.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.202
Hmm.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.770
Hey!
Down, boy.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.638
Bad laser puppy.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.109
It's 7:54!
I can't make it.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.743
Can't you just, uh, uh,

01:51.745 --> 01:53.378
magically stop time
or something?

01:53.380 --> 01:55.080
( laughs )

01:55.082 --> 01:56.615
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.750
Yeah, yeah.
Easy peasy time freezie.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.787
( clock ticking )

02:03.056 --> 02:05.891
( yipping in slo-mo )

02:07.727 --> 02:09.761
( singing in slo-mo )

02:10.730 --> 02:11.997
Ow!

02:11.999 --> 02:14.733
Do you know
what you just did?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.635
Uh, froze time?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.303
You froze time!

02:18.305 --> 02:20.239
Now I can get to school
and nod at Jackie.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.306
Hurry!

02:21.308 --> 02:22.674
School?

02:22.676 --> 02:26.145
But it's a ♪ freeze-day!

02:26.147 --> 02:28.147
Ha ha ha!
Whoo-hoo!

02:29.782 --> 02:31.083
( both laughing )

02:34.721 --> 02:35.821
Mmm! Mmm!

02:42.896 --> 02:44.062
Yee-hee!

02:44.064 --> 02:45.664
( laughing )

02:51.738 --> 02:55.908
MARCO (laughing):
That was the funnest
60 hours of my life!

02:55.910 --> 02:58.677
Oh, hey,
there's frozen Jackie!

02:58.679 --> 03:01.813
I better get into
optimal nod position.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.784
Ready.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.454
Or, maybe, now's the time

03:09.456 --> 03:12.724
to move on to the next step
of your crazy plan.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.760
You could ♪ talk to her

03:15.762 --> 03:17.996
The--the--
The wind isn't right.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.799
I've got a pimple coming in.
Uh, I'll just do the nod today.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.968
Okay.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.104
Easy peasy time unfreezie!

03:29.209 --> 03:30.375
Huh.

03:30.377 --> 03:34.213
Easy peasy time unfreezie!

03:35.782 --> 03:37.049
Ooh.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.151
Come on, Star.
What's going on?

03:39.153 --> 03:40.719
Star?
Star?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.054
Not you too.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.390
Ha ha!
I'm just messin' with ya.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.059
( grunts )

03:50.396 --> 03:54.199
Okay, Magic Instruction Book,
instruct me.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.835
Oh, no,
Glossaryck is frozen too.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.037
Good.
I never liked that guy.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.540
Scrape the sides, buddy.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.041
Okay, let's see, let's see.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.776
What to do if you make
a dimension explode.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.845
What to do
if you delete gravity.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.047
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Don't get any ideas.</i>

04:09.049 --> 04:10.315
Heh-heh. Sorry.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.051
Ah!
What to do if you freeze time.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.788
We can move time forward
if we go to the planes of time

04:16.790 --> 04:19.124
and push the wheel
of progress.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.762
Whoa.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.831
This is definitely

04:25.833 --> 04:27.899
one of the weirder places
we've been to.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.970
Weirder than that dimension
of cats with human faces?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.538
Here, kitty, kitty!

04:33.540 --> 04:36.908
(demonic voice)
Look away!

04:36.910 --> 04:37.809
( shivering )

04:37.811 --> 04:39.211
Look!

04:39.213 --> 04:41.146
That must be it.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.914
Whoa.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.983
Looks like
a giant hamster wheel.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.086
STAR: Now,
how do we start this thing?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.322
Hmm. I got this.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.960
( grunting )

05:01.034 --> 05:04.503
New plan.
Rainbow Raccoon Rotation.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.440
Hmm.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.375
Magic won't work on that.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.078
You got to use
the magic of toesies.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.148
Who are you?

05:16.150 --> 05:19.985
I'm Father Time.
And this is Rocksworth.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.987
He's  a rock,
but don't bring it up,

05:21.989 --> 05:23.989
he's kind of sensitive
about it.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.257
( makes motorboat sounds )

05:25.259 --> 05:28.860
Father Time?
So you must push this thing.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.030
Hey, look!
I'm over here.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.500
And now, I'm over here!
Ha ha ha ha!

05:35.502 --> 05:38.970
And how long
were you  <i>on </i> the wheel?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.139
Oh, you know, forever.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.941
Until someone
cast a freeze spell

05:42.943 --> 05:44.209
and knocked me off of it.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.378
What is  <i>that?</i>

05:46.380 --> 05:48.246
Uh, mud?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.516
Oh, it's glorious!

05:51.518 --> 05:53.452
I  <i>love </i> mud.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.521
( gags )

05:57.957 --> 06:00.559
So, Mr. Time,
how would you feel about

06:00.561 --> 06:02.594
getting the universe
started up again?

06:02.596 --> 06:06.365
Oh, where has this been
all of my life?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.966
Ah, look, look, look.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.902
You can play with mud
on your wheel.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.204
Huh?
Huh?

06:12.206 --> 06:16.541
Well, that is an enticing offer,
but nah.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.344
Arrghh!
Oh! There's some mud
that's a slightly
different color.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.346
And there's a twig,
and there's a bush,

06:21.348 --> 06:24.416
and I don't know
what that thing is,
but it's waddling.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.952
Wait! You can't just
leave time stopped!

06:26.954 --> 06:28.887
Whoo!

06:28.889 --> 06:30.322
But without time,

06:30.324 --> 06:32.090
rainbows can't shoot
across the sky,

06:32.092 --> 06:33.925
glitter can't glitter!

06:33.927 --> 06:36.061
And everyone we know
will be frozen forever!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.363
What's this?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.998
Ooh!

06:40.933 --> 06:42.033
( laughing )

06:42.035 --> 06:44.536
YOLO! Ha ha!

06:44.538 --> 06:46.171
Anything's possible.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.910
Yah! Whoo-hoo!

06:51.912 --> 06:54.946
( clock ticking )

06:54.948 --> 06:57.082
I hate this dimension.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.451
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

06:59.453 --> 07:01.753
Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

07:09.095 --> 07:12.297
Oh, my hearts.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.436
Not a word.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.537
Hee hee hee!

07:22.008 --> 07:23.141
I think he went in there.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.579
Wow.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.248
It's the history
of the whole universe.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.218
Ooh! Battle of Lexington.
Nailed it.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.563
( gasps ) It--

07:44.565 --> 07:45.964
It's me!

07:52.305 --> 07:54.372
Oh, I remember that!

07:56.108 --> 07:59.211
( chuckling )
Watching me is fun.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.782
Oh!
Hi, me!

08:03.784 --> 08:06.751
This place must keep track
of everything we've done
in our lives.

08:32.178 --> 08:37.015
Wow. I've been nodding
for a long time.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.250
FATHER TIME: Hey, guys!

08:38.252 --> 08:41.186
Isn't this place incredible?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.088
It's like we're living
in the future.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.122
Father Time!

08:44.124 --> 08:46.024
Emerald Snake Strike!

08:48.060 --> 08:49.694
Great.
I think we got him.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.497
Yuck. Okay, buddy,

08:52.499 --> 08:54.299
let's get you
back to your wheel.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.634
( gasps )

09:09.282 --> 09:12.584
( clock ticking )

09:12.586 --> 09:15.186
Ahh, all right.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.122
I guess I'll get back
to doing that.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.758
Oh, well,
it's only for all eternity.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.359
( sighs )

09:21.361 --> 09:23.061
We can't just make him.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.231
Maybe there's some other way
to turn that giant wheel.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.234
( chittering )

09:29.236 --> 09:32.470
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

09:32.472 --> 09:36.474
Actually, I was thinking we'd--
Never mind, it works.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.743
Now you can go
anywhere you want,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.245
<i>and </i> keep the wheel moving!

09:40.247 --> 09:43.181
Aww, thanks, guys.
I owe ya.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.816
Please, help yourself
to any of my mud.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.285
Even the nice stuff.
We're good.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.588
Oh, and maybe
don't freeze time again.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.223
It's kind of fragile.
You don't want to break it.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.258
Know what I mean?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.260
Well, so long. Ha ha!

09:55.262 --> 09:58.597
Time hamsters away!
Yoo-hoo!

10:02.768 --> 10:04.402
Wait, the wheel's moving.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.104
TOGETHER:
We've got to get back!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.439
( clock ticking )

10:09.275 --> 10:10.475
( puppies yipping )

10:10.477 --> 10:11.843
( singing )

10:13.145 --> 10:14.879
Whoa!
Aaaah!

10:25.625 --> 10:27.192
Hey, Jackie.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.161
Hey, Marco.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.331
Well, see ya.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.437
You did it!
You finally talked to her!

10:39.439 --> 10:41.439
What happened
to waiting for the perfect time?

10:41.441 --> 10:43.274
Well, all of a sudden,
I thought,

10:43.276 --> 10:45.777
if you have the time,
why waste it?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.746
Looks like I'm finally

10:47.748 --> 10:50.281
( slow-mo )
getting somewhere...

10:50.283 --> 10:53.718
Ha ha! You guys really get me!

10:57.223 --> 10:58.256
( yawning )

10:58.258 --> 11:00.925
STAR: Morning, Marco!
Hey.

11:00.927 --> 11:04.162
Aaaah! Whoaah!

11:04.164 --> 11:06.931
( Marco screaming )

11:06.933 --> 11:10.368
( laughing ) Whooo!

11:10.370 --> 11:11.803
Oh, that was awesome!

11:11.805 --> 11:13.505
I know, right?

11:13.507 --> 11:16.474
Stairs are so boring.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.810
I hope my parents don't flip
when they see this.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.278
MAN: I'm flipping!

11:21.647 --> 11:24.516
Dad!
Relax, son.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.453
This is like the perfect getaway
without actually getting away.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.655
( laughing ) Oh, boy!
( dolphin chattering )

11:30.657 --> 11:33.625
( laughing )
I love living here!

11:33.627 --> 11:37.228
If my parents found out
I've been using magic
for stuff like this...

11:37.230 --> 11:38.863
How about that?
This was cool,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.800
but next time,
maybe a little heads-up?

11:41.802 --> 11:45.203
Wet socks are a form of torture
in some countries.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.671
( doorbell ringing )
I'll get it!

11:46.673 --> 11:49.374
( blows horn )

11:49.376 --> 11:50.809
Oh, hey, Dad.
Dad?!

11:50.811 --> 11:53.812
Hello--
Oh, no!
I need to hide everything.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.547
( foghorn blaring )

11:58.350 --> 12:01.453
What a pleasant surprise.
( fake laugh )

12:01.455 --> 12:02.987
What brings you here
unexpectedly?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.390
Well,
I was in the neighborhood and--

12:05.392 --> 12:07.492
Agh.
Who am I kidding?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.428
You mother has banished me
from the castle.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.997
What did you do?
Nothing!

12:12.999 --> 12:15.533
I just left a garment or two
laying around.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.603
I thought perhaps,
I could stay here for a day

12:18.605 --> 12:20.572
while this blows over.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.742
Of course you can stay here.
You are  <i>familia.</i>

12:23.744 --> 12:27.245
You can watch the kids while me
and the wifey actually get away.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.279
Hasta mañana.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.547
Ah, good show!

12:29.549 --> 12:30.582
Huh? Oh, hello--

12:30.584 --> 12:32.784
Aaah!
( yipping )

12:33.886 --> 12:36.254
Star, if you mother was here

12:36.256 --> 12:38.890
and knew you were using
your wand inappropriately,

12:38.892 --> 12:41.593
she would send you
straight to St. Olga's.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.763
But I'm not your mother!

12:44.765 --> 12:48.266
I rather enjoy destructive
magical puppies.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.436
This visit is actually
gonna be fun then!

12:51.438 --> 12:52.904
TOGETHER: Father-Daughter Day!

12:52.906 --> 12:54.706
Tour time!

12:54.708 --> 12:57.675
Hey, guys, hold up.
I'm gonna go change my socks.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.712
Ugh, it's like
I'm walking in pudding.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.781
Check out  <i>my </i> room.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.683
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:05.685 --> 13:08.720
( creatures giggling )

13:09.822 --> 13:11.456
Get him!
Get him!

13:11.458 --> 13:12.423
Gut him like a fish!

13:12.425 --> 13:14.926
I got 20 bucks on Teddy!

13:14.928 --> 13:16.327
ALL: Hi, Star!

13:16.329 --> 13:17.829
I'm Kevin.
I'm new.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.298
Magnificent!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.333
If you like this,
let me show you

13:22.335 --> 13:24.803
the most magical room
in the whole house.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.472
The bathroom!

13:27.474 --> 13:30.909
( gasping, grunting )

13:30.911 --> 13:32.744
What a glorious throne!

13:32.746 --> 13:35.480
Why does it have a hole?

13:35.482 --> 13:40.351
Um, humans put things in there
and flush 'em down.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.053
Flush?
What's a flush?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.622
( water flushing )

13:44.624 --> 13:47.959
My word,
where does the water go?

13:47.961 --> 13:50.361
Nobody knows.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.465
It's one of Earth's
greatest mysteries.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.434
Does this go in it?

13:56.436 --> 13:57.969
All the time.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.405
( flushing )

14:02.741 --> 14:04.809
( gasps )

14:04.811 --> 14:09.047
( huffing, puffing )

14:09.049 --> 14:11.683
This?
I don't see why not.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.918
(flushing )

14:13.920 --> 14:14.919
This?

14:14.921 --> 14:16.821
Go for it.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.524
DAD: This?
STAR: Go ahead!

14:19.526 --> 14:20.992
What are they doing in there?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.861
( laughing )
This?

14:22.863 --> 14:25.430
Do it.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.465
( flushing )

14:27.467 --> 14:29.067
( growling )

14:31.036 --> 14:32.070
Hey, Marco.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.838
DAD: Love the bathroom!

14:33.840 --> 14:36.841
Thanks. What's next
on the itinerary for the d--

14:36.843 --> 14:39.377
Ohh-ohh-ohhhh!

14:39.379 --> 14:40.879
Marco taught me
how to play this.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.814
You are absolutely
gonna love it.

14:42.816 --> 14:46.684
The goal is to knock
this tiny moon into that hole.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.454
Ha ha!
What fun!

14:49.456 --> 14:52.457
You're holding your club
upside-down.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.025
This is a club?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.628
There's one thing
we got better on Mewni.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.630
Tally-ho!

15:00.699 --> 15:03.468
Ha ha! How's that for
getting it into the hole?

15:04.603 --> 15:06.404
What's that?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.805
♪ ( music box )

15:07.807 --> 15:10.074
That's the Candy Castle.
The next hole.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.977
Lord Salivary
of the Weebler elf clan.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.946
You sly dog!

15:14.948 --> 15:17.482
( roars )
What?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.517
Ha ha!

15:19.519 --> 15:22.487
Mommy,
why is Santa doing that?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.055
Dad!

15:24.057 --> 15:27.425
I'll teach you to give my wife
the googly eye!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.960
Dad, stop it!

15:31.430 --> 15:34.599
( people screaming )
DAD: Ha ha!

15:34.601 --> 15:37.702
The ball's in your court,
Salivary!

15:43.042 --> 15:45.443
( moaning )

15:45.445 --> 15:46.544
( sniffing )

15:48.647 --> 15:51.082
( screaming )

15:51.084 --> 15:54.552
Gross, gross,
gross, gross, gross!

15:56.488 --> 15:59.457
Ew. What was that?
( commotion )

15:59.459 --> 16:00.792
Aaaah!
Aaaaah!

16:01.794 --> 16:04.262
( grunting, laughter )

16:04.264 --> 16:06.197
Dad, what are you doing?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.466
Ha ha ha! Hello, darling!

16:09.501 --> 16:11.569
It's the middle of the night.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.105
Ah, the perfect time
for a tussle.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.474
Isn't that right, clowney?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.042
The name is Kevin,
old man!

16:18.044 --> 16:20.478
Arrr!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.146
Give it up, clown!

16:22.148 --> 16:23.614
Bring the pain!

16:25.718 --> 16:27.785
I can do this all night.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.721
DAD: Ha ha ha!
CLOWN: Chicky-wink.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.693
Good morning, Star.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.729
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.633
It was ridiculously loud
last night.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.169
It wasn't me, Oscar.
It was my dad.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.771
He's insane!

16:46.773 --> 16:48.539
He just thinks
he can come down to Earth

16:48.541 --> 16:49.607
and do whatever he wants.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.576
He is so inconsiderate.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.645
Huh.
I can weirdly relate.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.680
What do you mean?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.182
Doesn't that sound  <i>familiar?</i>

17:00.119 --> 17:02.253
Yeah.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.089
He does this to my mom.

17:05.091 --> 17:07.725
Never mind.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.828
Well, I'm just glad
he's leaving today.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.531
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.600
Hello, Star.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.069
Dad, what are you doing?

17:18.071 --> 17:19.937
I'm hanging lights
for the party.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.540
What party?
Oh, jeez!

17:22.542 --> 17:24.042
I forgot to tell you.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.277
I'm having
such a great time here,

17:26.279 --> 17:28.579
I've decided to stay.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.647
Isn't that great?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.582
Greeeeeat.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.651
Oh, and in celebration
of moving here,

17:33.653 --> 17:36.587
I've invited some friends
to check out my new digs.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.822
( doorbell ringing )
They're here.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.558
( party chatter )

17:40.560 --> 17:42.260
Chew, chew, chew,
chew, chew!

17:42.262 --> 17:45.630
( giggling )
Don't wake him up, man.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.099
We'll see if Salivary
recovers from this one.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.001
( laughing )

17:50.003 --> 17:52.070
Dad, I really need
to talk to you right now.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.604
HELIOS: Hey, guys!

17:53.606 --> 17:57.008
Well, here I am! Yeah!
Now the party can start.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.077
Ha ha! Ooh, tight squeeze.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.345
My bad.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.415
Oh, no.
Who invited Helios?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.651
That guy is the worst.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.754
Gross!
Now he got his ear pierced?

18:09.756 --> 18:13.224
There he goes,
eating all the appetizers.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.659
He ruins every party

18:14.661 --> 18:16.894
and is completely
oblivious about it.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.697
Funny.
I can weirdly relate.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.934
Look, people are already
going into orbit around him.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.902
No, no, no! Please, somebody!

18:24.904 --> 18:26.737
His gravitational pull--

18:26.739 --> 18:28.906
So why don't you
just kick him out?

18:28.908 --> 18:31.275
Along with  <i>everyone </i> else?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.911
No way.
I'm not talking to that tool.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.046
Ugh!

18:36.081 --> 18:37.248
Uh, hey, guys.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.850
Are those water balloo--
Whoa!

18:38.852 --> 18:40.651
Punch. Punch. Punch.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.054
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoah!

18:43.056 --> 18:46.290
Your feet are so soft.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.659
Aaaah! No!

18:48.661 --> 18:52.063
Whoo! Everybody, dancing really
sure works up my appe--

18:52.065 --> 18:53.397
Oho, dessert!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.935
Excuse me, I think
you've overstayed your welcome

18:57.937 --> 18:59.670
and you gotta go.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.874
Well,
you want to know something?

19:02.876 --> 19:04.408
I may be filled with hydrogen,

19:04.410 --> 19:06.344
but you're filled
with annoy-ogen.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.713
You just got
burned by the sun!

19:08.715 --> 19:10.047
( laughing )

19:10.049 --> 19:11.682
Whoa!

19:11.684 --> 19:13.217
MARCO:
I don't ask for much.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.354
Just a pair of dry socks,
that's all.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.290
It's like I'm mushing bananas
between my toes.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.659
Marco, I am so sorry

19:21.661 --> 19:23.661
that every time
I tried to have some fun,

19:23.663 --> 19:26.130
I ended up soaking your socks.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.766
Look, I love all the fun things
you want to do,

19:28.768 --> 19:31.235
just a little heads-up
would be nice.

19:31.237 --> 19:34.071
There's really nothing worse
than wet socks.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.374
Oh, yeah.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.309
Oh, yeah!

19:38.311 --> 19:40.978
Nothing worse than wet socks.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.847
( laughing )

19:42.849 --> 19:46.751
I'm still hungry,
but there's no more food.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.688
I guess I'll just have to eat
the whole planet!

19:50.690 --> 19:52.290
( gasp )

19:52.292 --> 19:54.859
It's time to purge this party.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.296
( groaning )

19:58.298 --> 20:01.032
Hey,  <i>two </i> pairs
of wet socks!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.800
I'm outta here.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.371
Because
I'm ridiculously apathetic

20:07.373 --> 20:10.041
to the suffering of others,
I'm leaving too.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.743
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

20:12.745 --> 20:14.779
Wow.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.081
I really made
a mess of things.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.753
There's no way
I'm poopin' out on  <i>this </i> party.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.121
Ahchoo!

20:24.123 --> 20:26.724
Um, sweetheart,

20:26.726 --> 20:29.994
I perhaps
got a little carried away.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.964
And I may have been
a little inconsiderate.

20:32.966 --> 20:37.235
I guess that's why your mother
threw me out in the first place.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.070
I'm sorry, you guys.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.372
And you'll patch
things up with Mom?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.907
Definitely.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.175
Hugs!
Hugs!

20:44.177 --> 20:45.910
What are you gonna do
with Helios?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.980
Ooh, after party!
Where we gonna go?

20:48.982 --> 20:52.917
I have no idea, but I'll
give you a ride! Ha ha!

20:52.919 --> 20:55.419
Tally-ho!
( Helios screaming )

20:55.421 --> 20:57.989
Hole in one! Ha ha ha ha!

20:57.991 --> 20:59.991
I'll send my top serfs here

20:59.993 --> 21:02.526
to make everything
better than new.

21:02.528 --> 21:03.594
Farewell.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.796
Bye, Dad.
Bye.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.466
Whew. From now on, I'll always
give you a heads-up.

21:08.468 --> 21:12.236
Thanks, but a surprise is good
every once in a while.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.271
Wouldn't you agree?

21:13.273 --> 21:14.438
Ah!

21:15.807 --> 21:19.010
