00:05.273 --> 00:07.075
[Lauren] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.108 --> 00:09.443
[Beals] I was presented
with clear evidence

00:09.477 --> 00:12.180
of inappropriate conduct.
Here it is.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.216
The Bible tells us
that sex is sacred.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.585
It's a gift to be shared
between husbands and wives.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.088
Steve, I have a right
to see my own daughter.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.556
You can see her in two years,
when she's 18.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.325
You'll regret this, Steve.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.327
[Sasha] Kaylie, I'm worried you
might still be losing weight

00:26.360 --> 00:28.062
to master this Genji Cho move.

00:28.096 --> 00:31.465
Ellen Beals thinks
my training schedule
and my diet are perfect.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.068
Emily Kmetko,
you're under arrest.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.304
[Emily] Don't tell Damon
that I got arrested.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.505
My lips are sealed.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.475
[Emily echoing] Mom?

00:41.509 --> 00:44.845
Mom? Mom!

00:44.878 --> 00:48.249
- I'm taking my break.
- Um, you're not at work.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.485
You fell asleep on the couch.
What time did you get home?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.355
Um... Home?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.490
Right. Late. Late.

00:56.524 --> 01:01.529
[Emily] You've, um, sure been
getting a lot of wear out
of that trench coat lately.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.465
Yes, um, what time is it?

01:04.498 --> 01:08.302
I have a parents meeting
at The Rock with Ellen Beals.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.638
- Have we heard about
my court date yet?
- Yes.

01:10.671 --> 01:14.875
They called, and your
hearing is set for Friday
at noon.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.579
[sighs] Thank God!
World Team trials are Saturday.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.415
Could you imagine me having
to tell Ellen Beals,
"I'm sorry, I have a conflict,

01:21.449 --> 01:23.217
I might be in jail
that day"?

01:23.251 --> 01:25.519
Honey, you're
not going to jail.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.556
You've never been
in trouble before,
you're a straight A student

01:28.589 --> 01:31.125
and you're an elite gymnast
on the National Team.

01:31.159 --> 01:35.229
- Yeah, it's great being me.
- It could be worse.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.665
[girls laughing]

01:37.698 --> 01:41.369
I guess the whole world
knows that I kissed my coach.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.473
- [honking horn]
- What are you lookin' at?

01:45.506 --> 01:48.442
Mom! It's OK!

01:50.578 --> 01:53.547
You know, you don't
have to train today.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.683
Yes, I do.

01:55.716 --> 01:59.320
If I hide out, people will think
that Sasha did something wrong.

01:59.353 --> 02:03.157
It's my fault he's in this mess,
so if I have to suffer
a little humiliation,

02:03.191 --> 02:06.460
bring it on.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.430
- [rock music plays]
- OK, let's hear it. Let's all
have a good laugh at my expense,

02:09.463 --> 02:12.566
- and move on.
- So, is Sasha a good kisser?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.303
Amazing. So good, in fact,
that we're planning on eloping.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.570
I will then move
into the Airstream,

02:16.604 --> 02:18.706
and if it's a boy,
we will name him Sasha Jr.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.175
I guess we need to extend
the "no boys rule"

02:21.209 --> 02:24.178
- to include
"no middle-aged men?"
- Sasha's not middle-aged.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.713
- He could be your father.
- [Emily] You guys!

02:25.746 --> 02:30.284
Come on.
She's embarrassed enough.

02:30.318 --> 02:35.256
- Are you OK?
- It's not me I'm worried about.
I'm worried about Sasha.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.392
What do you think
they're gonna do to him?

02:41.562 --> 02:46.700
Payson is my daughter,
and I can tell you for a fact,
Sasha did nothing wrong.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.238
That's fine for Payson,
but The Rock has three girls

02:50.271 --> 02:54.375
on the National Team
and the NGO has to consider
its legal liability.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.379
- If they sanction
a potential pedophile...
- [all] Pedophile?

02:58.412 --> 03:01.749
- [groans]
- Am I the only parent
who's gonna speak up

03:01.782 --> 03:04.552
- on behalf of Sasha?
- It was a kiss.

03:04.585 --> 03:09.490
A sweet little kiss.
And Sasha's very kissable.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.526
Can we get to the real issue?
The World Trials
are in three days.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.230
It's do or die time. And
considering the NGO's position,

03:16.264 --> 03:20.568
- do we dare let
Sasha coach our girls?
- Come on.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.738
Excuse me.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.640
May I have your
attention here, not over there?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.442
Nothing that
is happening over there

03:28.476 --> 03:31.412
should affect
you making the World Team, so...

03:31.445 --> 03:34.382
- ...let's get busy training.
- Belov.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.685
The National Committee does
not want you to coach any
of the National Team members.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.422
But we have World team tryouts.
We need our coach there.

03:41.455 --> 03:45.426
If you continue to work with
Mr. Belov, we'll have no choice
but to cut you from the team.

03:45.459 --> 03:49.797
And as far as The Rock
is concerned, you're suspended
until further notice.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.433
- That's not fair!
This is all my fault!
- Payson.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.669
[Sasha] It's OK.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.638
You all need
to make the Worlds Team.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.508
It's the next step
to getting into the Olympics.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.744
- Nothing else matters.
- He's right.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.381
- Who's gonna coach us
in the meantime?
- I will.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.582
[rock music plays]

04:11.652 --> 04:13.821
You don't need me to do this.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.291
All you have to do is follow
the rules and stay focused.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.326
Understand?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.030
Good.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.632
* Like it or not

04:24.665 --> 04:26.600
* Shoot for the stars

04:26.634 --> 04:29.803
* It's the only way
to move *

04:29.837 --> 04:32.673
* Got a taste
of fortune and fame *

04:32.706 --> 04:36.477
* Trying to beat the devil
Beat him at his game *

04:36.510 --> 04:39.747
* It'll make or break down
It's only all or none *

04:39.780 --> 04:44.051
* You're either dead
in the water or got
it made in the sun *

04:44.084 --> 04:48.389
* I'm gonna go off
like a loaded gun *

04:50.658 --> 04:52.693
OK, listen up.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.697
World Trials have
been moved up a day
to Friday at 11.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.734
That gives you all one
less day to practice, so
let's not waste any more time.

05:03.671 --> 05:07.441
- Ms. Beals?
- Coach Beals.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.512
I have a, um,
conflict on Friday.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.648
I was wondering if maybe
you could schedule me last,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.884
or let me come in really early?

05:16.917 --> 05:20.421
You have a conflict?
[sighs] With a boy?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.890
No, not with a boy.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.758
It's a family emergency.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.694
I'm sorry to hear that.
A death?

05:26.727 --> 05:30.564
- No.
- Well, I expect
to see you there Friday at 11

05:30.598 --> 05:32.566
if you want to
make the Worlds Team.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.503
There will be no more
second chances this time.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.539
Now, let's go! You're missing
valuable practice time.

06:10.738 --> 06:15.676
- Hey! What's up?
- I don't want you to
compete at the World Trials.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.745
Not in your condition.
You have too much to lose.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.913
- Is this still about my eating?
- You need to get
your strength back.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.484
Enough! Look...

06:23.517 --> 06:27.555
I know you mean well,
but I've been through this
with Sasha and my parents.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.190
They've weighed me. They're
convinced that nothing is wrong.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.893
So just butt out. OK?

06:35.729 --> 06:39.166
My sister used to put
rolls of coins in her
underwear to add weight.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.701
No one looked there.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.970
Other times,
she gorged herself on water

06:43.003 --> 06:46.707
or just rigged the scale.
How'd you do it?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.709
How did you fool
Sasha and your parents?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.579
I'm not fooling
my parents, Austin.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.981
For your information,
I'm the only thing that's
keeping them together.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.217
- What...?
- My gymnastics,

06:57.250 --> 07:00.854
my championship,
it's the only thing that's
keeping my family together.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.591
[inhales] Kaylie,
I'm just telling you...

07:03.624 --> 07:05.993
No, I don't need you
to tell me anything.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.928
I'm fine, my eating is fine.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.532
The only thing that is not fine
is you butting into my life.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.035
So stay out.

07:23.644 --> 07:27.648
As you both know, I made
a commitment to Payson
to get her to the Olympics.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.751
And I intend to honor
that commitment and
continue my work with her,

07:30.784 --> 07:35.623
- no matter what it takes.
- Thank you, Sasha,
for your commitment.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.958
And we just want you to know
how terrible we feel about...

07:37.991 --> 07:40.794
This commitment
that you're honoring.
Are you doing this for Payson

07:40.828 --> 07:42.830
or for yourself because she's
the only one you have left?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.866
- Mark!
- No.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.601
That's a fair question.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.237
If I believed,
for even a second,

07:50.270 --> 07:52.540
that my presence
was harming Payson
or one of the other girls,

07:52.573 --> 07:55.743
I would walk away again
and not look back.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.246
- But your presence
is harming Payson.
- No, Dad, it's not.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.649
It is. As long as you
continue to train together,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.984
there's gonna be gossip
and whispering and innuendo.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.987
And I will not put
Payson through that.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.056
We don't have to
decide anything tonight.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.059
Why don't we just
take some time?

08:12.092 --> 08:15.796
I'm afraid time has run out.
Payson's window of opportunity
could very well be closing.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.299
So it's imperative,
for all everyone
has already sacrificed,

08:19.332 --> 08:21.669
to continue her
training without delay.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.072
I'm sorry.
I'm not blaming anyone.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.075
But if Payson makes it to the
Olympics, it won't be with you.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.019
A petition, I'll have
all the parents sign it.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.656
And the girls can record
a video that we'll show
to the National Committ...

08:42.690 --> 08:44.692
Stop. The girls
are my responsibility.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.760
I should know what they're
thinking before they do.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.296
I should see trouble
before it happens,
but I didn't.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.099
I allowed this to happen.
And it doesn't matter
if I was blind

08:52.132 --> 08:56.103
or if I simply made
an error in judgment.
I failed them as a coach.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.606
And maybe...

08:58.639 --> 09:00.140
Maybe I'm not such
a good man after all.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.313
Don't say that.
Don't think that.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.982
I can't stand what they're
saying about you, Sasha.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.752
You are a good man.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.320
And an honorable man.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.757
And a righteous man.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.892
And that's why I love you.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.031
I love you, too.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.727
Wait, wait, wait.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.797
We can't do this.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.999
- No, I want to.
- No.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.768
I'm sorry.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.036
But if I let you
sacrifice your values,

10:03.070 --> 10:05.673
I wouldn't be any
good for you either.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.076
I can't let you
forget who you are.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.814
I'm sorry.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.924
Lauren, honey,
we need to talk.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.159
Your mother's memorial service
is in a couple of weeks.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.896
I'm not going.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.065
She was a drunk and a drug
addict and she never loved me.

10:32.099 --> 10:35.002
Why would I pay my respects
to a woman like that?

10:37.004 --> 10:39.673
Honey, because
she was your mother.

10:39.707 --> 10:43.176
I waited for her at the
bus station before Nationals.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.178
But she never got off the bus.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.081
She abandoned me again!

10:48.115 --> 10:50.951
Because I'm nothing to her.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.686
You want to know something?

10:52.720 --> 10:58.025
I'm glad that she's dead!
I don't need her
hurting me anymore!

11:04.097 --> 11:06.199
Forgive me, Lord.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.036
[sobbing]

11:09.069 --> 11:13.006
I came so close to breaking
my covenant with you. I just...

11:15.175 --> 11:21.081
Why would you allow me
to have attraction in my heart
for a man that I cannot have?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.283
Why?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.757
[sighs]

11:29.790 --> 11:32.125
It was me, Lord, I know.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.963
I just need Your help.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.803
I will read Your word
and wait for confirmation.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.108
Lord, just show me where to go.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.311
Tell me who to love.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.916
[man sobbing]

12:03.791 --> 12:05.158
[sighs]

12:13.333 --> 12:16.303
I can't tell her
I kept her mother from her.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.906
She'll never forgive me.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.041
She needs to know
she was loved.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.344
Oh, God.
It'll kill me to tell her.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.347
I'll come with you.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.784
You would do that for me?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.826
And can I ask another favor?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.296
Will you pray with me?

12:53.373 --> 12:57.044
[house music plays]

12:57.077 --> 13:01.114
* Only you can make you happy

13:01.148 --> 13:04.184
* Only you can
make you happy *

13:06.153 --> 13:08.822
Dude, come on.
Bodacious Boulders
is not where

13:08.856 --> 13:10.357
we're gonna find dancers
for the video.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.226
Hey, I'm just trying
to have a good time.

13:13.260 --> 13:17.297
Groupies don't throw
themselves at A&R guys,
so give me a break, OK?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.967
Excuse me, miss.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.302
What can I...

No, Bambi!
My name is Bambi.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.016
Bambi. Uh, which way
to the little boy's room?

13:36.049 --> 13:39.219
Right past VIP, hang a left.

13:41.288 --> 13:45.859
Look, Damon, this is
humiliating, OK, and it's
not at all what it looks like.

13:45.893 --> 13:51.831
I swear! Unless it looks
like I'm bartending.
Then it is what it looks like.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.635
Please don't tell Emily.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.270
She doesn't
want to see me anyway.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.240
Yes, she does. She's just
too proud to tell you.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.977
- Tell me what?
- That she's in trouble.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.080
OK, she'll kill me
for telling you, but
she's in big trouble, Damon.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.360

says I don't listen.
Is that true?

14:32.940 --> 14:36.076
This thing with Sasha...
Help me understand.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.912
Did he do anything
to lead you on?
Anything that...?

14:38.946 --> 14:40.280
No.

14:40.313 --> 14:44.952
After my surgery,
I just wanted to feel the same.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.255
But I didn't.

14:48.288 --> 14:52.492
Everything was different,
my gymnastics, my body.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.129
My confidence.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.432
That's a lot to deal with.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.368
And I tried.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.337
But no matter what I did,
I just kept feeling...

15:04.371 --> 15:07.440
...depressed and clumsy

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
and stupid.

15:09.509 --> 15:14.114
- Payson, you're not...
- Sasha was there.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.349
He never gave up on me.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.319
When I didn't want to go
to The Rock Awards,
he made sure that I was honored.

15:19.352 --> 15:23.523
He opened my eyes to ballet.
He made me feel...

15:27.460 --> 15:29.362
He made me feel beautiful

15:29.396 --> 15:33.400
and protected and special.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.269
You are special.

So very loved and special.

- Did I ruin everything?
- No, you didn't.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.464
If Kaylie wants to compete at
the highest level, she has to
push her body to the limits.

16:04.497 --> 16:08.368
Kaylie stopped pushing
herself a long time ago.

16:08.401 --> 16:12.339
It's the disease,
the anorexia, that's
doing all the pushing now.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.307
And it won't stop.
It will lie and deceive

16:14.341 --> 16:17.144

shuts down and it kills her.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.447
What the hell are you
doing here? I thought
I told you to butt out.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.351
You know me. Tell me to do one
thing and I do the opposite.

16:24.384 --> 16:29.156
- You think this is funny?
- Honey, he's just
worried about you.

16:29.189 --> 16:33.426
Really? And what gives you the
right to be worried about me?

16:33.460 --> 16:37.264
Or lecture me or talk to
my parents behind my back?

16:37.297 --> 16:40.267
- You don't want to know.
- Yeah, I do.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.769

I knew there was something
special about you.

Before you get a big head,
it's not the way you look,
'cause I've dated cuter girls.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.446
And it ain't your zesty
personality, 'cause you
can be a real pain in the ass.

the rest out.

- Are you crazy?
- I must be.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.567
But you asked. And I
realize I've probably
ruined any chance I have

17:14.601 --> 17:17.437
with you by showing up like
this. But if I can help you,
then it's worth it.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.539
Get out.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.442
- Now.
- [Austin] What?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.611
- Why?
- Because this isn't
about helping Kaylie.

17:24.644 --> 17:28.615
It's about some
testosterone-fueled jock

17:28.648 --> 17:30.417

and I'm not gonna have it.

28:06.853 --> 28:10.723
No, Kaylie, no. There is no such
a thing as individual sport.

28:10.757 --> 28:13.125
When you go out there,
you are not alone.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.161
You always taking
your family, your friends.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.229
And, most importantly,
your teammates.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.166
And they're gonna give you
the courage and the support.
Take their courage,

28:20.199 --> 28:22.268
and you will succeed.
You gonna succeed.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.170
How about giving a big hug
to each other?

Good job!

28:56.102 --> 28:59.005
That completes round one.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.942
We will now take a short break
and post the current standings.

29:02.975 --> 29:06.813
Please keep in mind,
the top six girls
from the end of round two

29:06.846 --> 29:09.081
will advance to Worlds.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.783
[Payson] Are you sure
I'm ready for this?

29:10.817 --> 29:12.118
[Sasha] I've never been
more certain of anything.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.787
- And what if they
don't want to see me?
- Then we make them.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.793
Kim, what's going on?

29:20.827 --> 29:23.195
Sasha's gonna make the
National Committee see Payson.

29:25.364 --> 29:29.301
Well, I don't know about y'all,
but I'm not about to miss this.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.976
- Dad.
- Son.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.980
Belov, stop right there.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.218
I've brought Payson Keeler.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.054
And, with all due respect,

29:48.087 --> 29:50.857
we're not leaving until
you've seen what she can do.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.259
Would you stop them!
They can't do this!

29:53.292 --> 29:55.995
[Sasha] In France, you saw
Payson Keeler the power gymnast.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.899
Today, I want you to see Payson
Keeler the artistic gymnast.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.871
[classical music plays]

30:13.012 --> 30:16.015
Payson Keeler is not
an artistic gymnast.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.851
You've seen how
much grace she has.
This is ridiculous.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.053
Be quiet, Ellen.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.354
We'd like to watch.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.231
[cheering, applause]

31:58.250 --> 31:59.351
[Payson] We did it!

32:00.286 --> 32:03.455
You did it.
I'm so proud of you.

32:03.489 --> 32:06.993
- That was amazing!
- You were awesome!

32:07.026 --> 32:08.027
Beautiful.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.497
Sasha!

32:11.530 --> 32:14.133
You can't leave. Not now.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.071
I don't belong here.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.709
Sasha's our coach.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.744
I couldn't have
done it without him.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.313
You have to let him stay.

32:27.346 --> 32:31.483
And I wouldn't be the
National Champion without him.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.988
And I wouldn't be
anything without him.

32:36.022 --> 32:40.292
We don't care what people say.
Sasha hasn't done
anything wrong.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.364
Don't do it.

32:45.397 --> 32:49.268
Mr. Belov, you can stay.

You've had a tough
few days, Lauren.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.239
- Are you OK?
- It wasn't that tough.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.308
She didn't mean
anything to me.

33:29.341 --> 33:33.279
She hasn't seen me do gymnastics
since I was, like, five.

33:35.414 --> 33:39.051
She bought me
my first leotard.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.353
She bought one for her, too.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.324
[sobbing] We matched.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.427
One day she was there,

33:48.460 --> 33:50.462
and then she was just gone.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.365
And she never came back for me.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.841
I can't do this, Sasha.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.311
It's OK. It's OK, Lauren.

you need to know, Lauren.

- Look at me.

34:22.861 --> 34:26.298
Your mother loved you
and wanted to see you.

- What?
- Leslie tried
to come to Nationals.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.504
I kept her away.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.506
She tried to
see you every year.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.377
- I didn't tell you.
- [sobbing]

34:38.410 --> 34:42.514
- My mother wanted to see me?
- More than anything.

34:42.548 --> 34:46.352
It's my fault
you never saw her.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.221
She was just here, Lauren.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.458
She left this for you.
Here.

I'm so sorry.

35:03.235 --> 35:06.238

Committee you can't
do this right now.
