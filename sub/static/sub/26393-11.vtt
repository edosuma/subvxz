WEBVTT

00:03.786 --> 00:04.961
Tina.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.049
Yeah?
You are not
gonna believe

00:06.093 --> 00:08.182
what my brother Curtis
did this time.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.966
He finally burned
through his lottery winnings?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
No, I'm still
praying on that.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.756
But you know how I got my mother
her favorite long-stem roses

00:17.800 --> 00:19.062
for her birthday?Mm-hmm.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.586
Well, Curtis had
to go and outdo me

00:21.630 --> 00:24.937
and got her entire
yard landscaped.

00:24.981 --> 00:28.202
Ooh, that's nice.Of course it's nice.

00:28.245 --> 00:31.379
He hired the Property Brothers
to do it.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.597
[doorbell rings]

00:32.641 --> 00:34.556
Well, maybe I married
the wrong brother.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.036
[laughs] Yeah, right.

00:36.079 --> 00:39.213
His money gonna run out one day,
but my sexy is forever.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.519
Hey, guys.Hey, Tina.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.434
Come on in. What's up?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.045
Okay, so we
need a favor.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.264
Look, I already told you, Dave,

00:47.308 --> 00:49.136
I'm not doing a Christmas card
photo with you.

00:51.834 --> 00:55.229
Seems like just the message our
world needs right now, but okay.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.100
We were wondering
if you guys were free

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
to watch Grover Friday night.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.060
Yeah, Gemma's school is having
their annual fund-raiser,

01:00.103 --> 01:02.279
and I want to watch
her rock the mic

01:02.323 --> 01:04.151
and raise some
dolla dolla bills, y'all.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.241
It's my first big event
as principal,

01:07.284 --> 01:10.070
and I need to give a speech
and I really need it to go well.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.549
Well, I told you,
if you get nervous,

01:11.593 --> 01:12.637
just use my little trick.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.335
What's your little trick, Dave?

01:14.378 --> 01:16.685
When in doubt,
quote Billy Joel lyrics.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.558
His music brings
the world together.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.082
Well, why are you
so nervous?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.996
The board of trustees
will be there.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.521
Yeah, and they're just a bunch
of rich, stuck-up moms

01:26.564 --> 01:29.480
who are all jealous of how
pretty and smart Gemma is.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.265
That's not true.

01:31.308 --> 01:33.180
And you really need
to stop watching Mean Girls.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.444
Not gonna happen.

01:36.487 --> 01:40.187
Their queen
is Lyndsey Worthington.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.145
And that's Lyndsey
with two Ys,

01:42.189 --> 01:43.712
so you know she thinks
she's better

01:43.755 --> 01:46.149
than all the other Lindseys.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.672
Well, if you need
some extra support,

01:47.716 --> 01:49.152
Malcolm can
watch Grover,

01:49.196 --> 01:51.198
and Calvin and I could go
to the fund-raiser.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.982
You will?
Yeah.
Yeah, Tina,

01:53.025 --> 01:54.897
we will?

01:54.940 --> 01:57.378
I don't want to spend
my Friday night

01:57.421 --> 01:59.075
at some school fund-raiser.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.946
Oh, come on, baby,
do it for Gemma.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.731
And don't forget,
it's for the kids.

02:02.774 --> 02:06.952
Yeah, right, at some
private school. No, thanks.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.171
There's a
prime rib dinner

02:08.215 --> 02:09.564
and an open bar
with top-shelf liquor.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.958
Well, if it's
for the kids, you know.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.917
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:14.960 --> 02:15.874
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.014
Hey, you guys made it.Yes.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.885
Anything to support
our Gemma.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.410
Aw, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.063
Now, who wants a tour
of the school?

02:31.107 --> 02:32.413
I do!
Tina does!

02:35.938 --> 02:37.766
Okay, Calvin, I know
you were hesitant

02:37.809 --> 02:39.811
about coming tonight,
but the good news is,

02:39.855 --> 02:41.378
is there's a photographer
walking around

02:41.422 --> 02:45.121
and every table
has props.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.517
You look like a not-
so-Super Mario Brother.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.346
[Italian accent]:
Well, then you can be my Luigi.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.044
Dave, I mean,
really, what...

02:55.087 --> 02:57.394
First the Christmas card
and now this?

02:57.438 --> 02:59.483
Why-why are you so obsessed
with taking a picture with me?

02:59.527 --> 03:00.789
Well, because
you're my friend,

03:00.832 --> 03:02.225
and I have pictures
with all my friends.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.531
But you could be

03:03.574 --> 03:06.098
the first one
with a monocle.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.060
All right, Mr. Monopoly,
show me where the bar is,

03:11.103 --> 03:13.280
and do not pass "Go."

03:15.760 --> 03:18.546
Okay, G, what are we
gonna do next?

03:18.589 --> 03:20.722
I'm gonna play
on my iPad.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.290
Hey, come on, man. Hey, look,
when Marty and I were kids,

03:23.333 --> 03:24.813
all we had were each other

03:24.856 --> 03:26.423
and our imaginations.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.209
We used to play things
like, uh, cowboys and Indians,

03:29.252 --> 03:30.949
cops and robbers,
and we had a blast.

03:30.993 --> 03:31.907
Did we?

03:33.517 --> 03:34.779
'Cause all I remember is,

03:34.823 --> 03:36.085
you always got to be
the good guy

03:36.128 --> 03:38.174
and I always ended up dead.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.742
Well, the point is,
you remember it.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.918
How many memories do you have
on your iPad?

03:42.961 --> 03:45.355
Uh, about 64 gigs.

03:47.009 --> 03:51.100
Hey, I know,
we shall build a fort

03:51.143 --> 03:53.015
and pretend we are knights

03:53.058 --> 03:56.105
defending it
from ferocious dragons.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.106
What do you say, Marty?

03:57.149 --> 03:59.326
[laughs] Counteth me in.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.893
[chuckles]
How about you, Grover?

04:01.937 --> 04:04.505
I can't believe I'm saying this,

04:04.548 --> 04:06.942
but I think
it's past my bedtime.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.601
What do you say, Calvin?

04:13.644 --> 04:15.820
You see anything here
at the silent auction table?

04:15.864 --> 04:20.390
Just a bunch of bougie
white folks crap.

04:20.434 --> 04:24.307
Opera tickets,
a ski trip to Aspen,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.048
a hacky sack signed

04:26.091 --> 04:28.050
by Dave Matthews.

04:28.093 --> 04:31.575
Man, I wouldn't bid a dime
for any of this junk.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.145
Ooh, two tickets
to Super Soul Sunday

04:36.188 --> 04:37.581
and a meet and greet with Oprah.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.497
Ooh, how much
they want for that?

04:40.541 --> 04:43.065
Says the opening bid
is 200 bucks.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.633
I'm-a throw my hat
in the ring.
Ah-ah.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.156
Throw your hat
somewhere else, Dave.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.378
My mama loves Oprah.
I'm getting this for her.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.683
Aw, that's so sweet.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.119
Yeah, it'll make
my brother Curtis

04:54.163 --> 04:56.818
feel like a jackass.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.734
Not so sweet.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.911
Why don't you go bid
on something more your speed,

05:02.954 --> 05:04.434
say... that full body wax.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.047
Nah, it's winter.
Gemma likes me fuzzy.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.490
How much you gonna bid?

05:16.533 --> 05:20.450
Dave, it's important
to set the tone here.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.800
All right? You want to let
the other bidders know

05:22.844 --> 05:24.149
that you mean business.

05:24.193 --> 05:27.544
So, starting bid
is $200...

05:27.588 --> 05:29.546
Calvin Butler,

05:29.590 --> 05:32.636
$200.01.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.034
Gemma, can I make
an observation?
Yeah.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.036
I know you said this was
a progressive school,

05:41.079 --> 05:43.081
but I thought it'd be
a little more diverse.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.692
Like, right now
I feel like I'm at

05:44.735 --> 05:49.000
the Country Music Awards
and I'm Hootie.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.873
Well, it's not like I don't
want it to be more diverse.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.614
I've been to all
the local preschools

05:53.657 --> 05:55.529
talking about
progressive education

05:55.572 --> 05:58.706
and how much better it is
for kids not to get grades.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.403
Mm, see, there's
your problem.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.275
Black families need
their kids to get grades.

06:03.319 --> 06:06.540
But if you give grades,
the kids will feel judged.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.324
Yeah, but if you don't
give them grades,

06:08.368 --> 06:09.934
how do you know
if they're stupid?

06:15.940 --> 06:19.248
Gemma, people of color are not
attracted to schools like this

06:19.291 --> 06:22.033
because we know our kids
are on an uneven playing field.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.818
I mean, we don't have
the luxury

06:23.861 --> 06:25.428
of sending them somewhere
that doesn't emphasize

06:25.472 --> 06:26.951
traditional academics.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.824
Well, what am I
gonna do?

06:29.867 --> 06:32.217
I promised the trustees
I would increase diversity.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.784
They want this school
to look like

06:33.828 --> 06:37.440
the inside of
Angelina Jolie's minivan.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.007
Well, right now it
looks more like

06:39.050 --> 06:41.357
the Brady Bunch's
station wagon.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.491
Gemma!
Lyndsey!

06:44.534 --> 06:46.318
Hi, I'm Lyndsey Worthington,

06:46.362 --> 06:48.408
head of the board of trustees
here at the Walcott Academy.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.019
Oh. Tina Butler.
Nice to meet you.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.629
Gemma, why didn't you tell us

06:52.673 --> 06:54.457
you were bringing
a prospective parent tonight?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.850
Oh, actually, Tina...

06:55.893 --> 06:57.286
Surprised Gemma.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.983
You know, I didn't think
I could make it

06:59.027 --> 07:01.029
because I have my weekly
girls' night out,

07:01.072 --> 07:03.335
but Beyoncé canceled.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.948
You're friends with Beyoncé?

07:06.991 --> 07:09.298
You know this?

07:13.171 --> 07:14.434
That was all me.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.009
So, please,
if you have any questions,

07:25.053 --> 07:28.099
don't hesitate to reach out.
We can't wait to meet...

07:28.143 --> 07:31.276
I'm sorry,
what was your son's name again?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.974
Chadwick.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.717
Chadwick Butler III.Oh.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.502
Well, tell Chadwick
we're so excited.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.418
Maybe now the drama department
can finally do Hamilton.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.772
Hmm?
What are you doing?

07:48.816 --> 07:50.644
What?! You said
you wanted diversity.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.602
Me and Chadwick got your back.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.432
I appreciate that,
but they're gonna find out

07:56.476 --> 07:58.826
that you're not really
a prospective parent.Oh, girl, please.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.697
Little Chadwick can
get trapped in a well

08:00.741 --> 08:02.525
before the school year starts.
Nobody'll ever find out.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.921
Excuse me, but are
you Tina?

08:06.964 --> 08:09.706
We've heard so much about
you and little Chadwick.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.707
Oh.

08:10.751 --> 08:11.578
Tina, these are
two other members

08:11.621 --> 08:13.144
of our board
of trustees.
Oh.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.320
Pyper.
Spelled
with a "Y."

08:15.364 --> 08:17.540
Well, whywouldn't you?[both laughing]

08:18.889 --> 08:20.978
And this is Greer.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.632
Hi. [laughs]

08:22.676 --> 08:24.547
We heard that you're considering
the school, and...

08:24.591 --> 08:26.810
And if you're looking for
a mother's perspective,

08:26.854 --> 08:29.030
we'd love to take you
to lunch some time.Mm.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.205
Do you play
tennis?

08:30.248 --> 08:31.685
Are you kidding?

08:31.728 --> 08:32.990
Serena is my
goddaughter.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.035
[gasps]Oh.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.300
What the...?

08:38.343 --> 08:41.216
Who is Dr. Allen Bancroft, M.D.?

08:41.259 --> 08:44.349
I don't know. Why?He bid $500.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.743
And he wrote
the "D-R" and the "M.D."

08:49.093 --> 08:51.313
We get it, Allen,
you're a doctor.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.665
Well, you gonna
outbid him?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.711
Of course I am.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.496
I'm not gonna let some fancy
doctor think he can outbid me.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.020
$500.01.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.503
Look, I'm gonna
hit the bar.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.766
Stay here and make sure no one
outbids me on this package.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.855
You got it.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.205
Ooh, listen, baby, baby,
I don't have time to explain.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.946
We're doing this for Gemma.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.861
We're rich,
we're prospective parents,

09:17.905 --> 09:20.429
and I hang out with Beyoncé.

09:20.472 --> 09:24.476
So, this must
be Chadwick II.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.741
Please.
All my friends call me Wick.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.394
Oh.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.832
Well, at least
Barack and Michelle do.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.573
[laughter]

09:36.619 --> 09:39.361
So, ready to slay
some dragons, milord?

09:39.404 --> 09:40.841
Okay.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.277
Where's the dragon?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.018
Marty's gonna
be the dragon.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.847
What?! Why do I always got
to be the dragon, man?!

09:46.890 --> 09:49.458
It's like cops and robbers
all over again.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.069
So,

09:52.113 --> 09:55.812
since I'm Sir Grover, does
that mean I'm in charge?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.249
Indeed. This is your
castle, milord.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.643
Cool.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.211
I'm gonna need it
to be a lot bigger.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.648
Really? 'Cause I think
it looks good...

10:05.692 --> 10:07.563
Sir Grover has spoken!

10:09.739 --> 10:11.523
[laughter]I cannot believe

10:11.567 --> 10:13.308
you went to the royal wedding.

10:13.351 --> 10:16.093
You know, it was great until
the queen got a little handsy

10:16.137 --> 10:17.617
on the dance floor.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.880
Queen Elizabeth groped you?!

10:19.923 --> 10:22.796
No, he's talking
about Elton John.Ooh.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.233
[laughter]

10:25.276 --> 10:27.801
Excuse me? Tina, could I
talk to you for a minute?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.629
Oh, sure. Wick, would
you mind staying here

10:29.672 --> 10:31.108
to entertain
our new friends?

10:31.152 --> 10:32.414
But of course, darling.Oh.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.897
Now, ladies, please,

10:36.940 --> 10:39.160
do any of you have
a recommendation

10:39.203 --> 10:41.771
for a veterinarian
who can work on white tigers?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.165
What's up?I'm freaking out.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.123
Why?

10:46.167 --> 10:47.734
Because I can't go up
on that stage and tell

10:47.777 --> 10:49.866
this entire school that
I'm gonna make it more diverse

10:49.910 --> 10:52.564
if I can't actually do it.
I feel like a fraud.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.131
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.264
They already think
that you got me and Chadwick.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.700
You look like you're killing it.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.136
But it's a lie.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.182
Yeah, a lie
that's gotten me invited

11:01.225 --> 11:04.185
to three brunches,
two happy hours, and a spa day.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.840
And for the record,
I am now Tina with a "Y." Ah!

11:08.232 --> 11:10.365
Gemma,

11:10.408 --> 11:12.149
we're gonna start serving dinner
in about ten minutes,

11:12.193 --> 11:14.412
so maybe now is a good time
to give your speech.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.980
Oh, I... well, I don't know.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.547
I mean, everyone's
having so much fun.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.027
Maybe I should just send them
an e-mail.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.464
No. We're all dying
to hear your ideas.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.728
I mean, you've already been
so successful in your outreach.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.382
Get up there

11:27.425 --> 11:29.123
and tell us your secret.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.080
But then it wouldn't be
a secret.

11:30.124 --> 11:33.605
Gemma.All right, I'm going.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.260
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.219
I'm Gemma Johnson,
the new principal,

11:38.262 --> 11:40.656
and I just wanted to take
a moment to share with you

11:40.700 --> 11:43.050
my vision for the future
of Walcott Academy.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.183
As believers
in progressive education,

11:46.227 --> 11:48.969
you all know that one
of our primary values

11:49.012 --> 11:52.363
is diversity among our students.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.934
But we all know that we haven't
been able to make that happen.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.067
And I thought the solution

12:00.110 --> 12:02.025
was gonna be reaching out
to the community,

12:02.069 --> 12:04.201
but clearly that hasn't worked.

12:04.245 --> 12:07.074
I mean, I have gone to every
school in the local community

12:07.117 --> 12:09.990
and we are still just as white
as the actual Hamilton.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.300
But-but not because
we're bad people.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.825
But because we tend
to only surround ourselves

12:18.868 --> 12:20.261
with people just like us.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.567
Like some snooty club.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.788
Well, membership has
its privileges.

12:27.964 --> 12:31.185
But that's not who you feel
like you are.

12:31.228 --> 12:34.188
You feel like someone who has
the answer to our problems,

12:34.231 --> 12:36.190
but when you tell people
your answer,

12:36.233 --> 12:38.845
you find out you might actually
be part of the problem.

12:38.888 --> 12:42.109
And then you don't know
what to say.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.028
I-I don't know what to say.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.553
[mouths]

12:52.902 --> 12:56.123
[coughs]
Billy Joel.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.602
[coughs]

12:57.646 --> 12:59.866
You see...

13:01.606 --> 13:04.131
We didn't start the fire.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.399
It was always burning,
since the world's been turning.

13:14.054 --> 13:18.014
But I believe we can
change that, and...

13:20.277 --> 13:24.368
You may be right.
I may be crazy.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.588
But I just may be the lunatic
you're looking for. Thank you.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.945
Milord, lower your drawbridge
so I may enter your castle.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.429
No, peasant!

13:42.909 --> 13:45.781
I told you, you're dragon bait.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.873
I believe I hear the flap
of wings in the east.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.614
[roars]

13:55.791 --> 13:58.011
Sir Grover,
the dragon approaches.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.490
Come help me slay it.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.625
You got this.

14:03.668 --> 14:06.149
But you have the sword, Milord.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.629
Use your imagination.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.633
[shouts]

14:11.676 --> 14:13.635
[grunting]

14:19.249 --> 14:20.903
[imitates heartbeat]

14:24.864 --> 14:29.129
Ha! Ha!

14:29.172 --> 14:32.132
Ha...

14:32.175 --> 14:34.221
Come on, man.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.658
I just blew fire all over you.
You're supposed to die.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.921
[sighs]
Fine, I'll die.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.575
[grunts]

14:40.618 --> 14:42.925
I'm dead.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.448
Die, foul beast!

14:44.492 --> 14:45.667
[roars, shouts]

14:45.710 --> 14:47.669
[straining]

14:47.712 --> 14:49.976
Ow!

14:50.019 --> 14:51.151
Let me show you how it's done.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.500
[shouting]

14:57.157 --> 15:00.900
I was only evil
because I was never loved.

15:04.033 --> 15:08.951
♪ Amazing

15:08.995 --> 15:11.388
♪ Grace

15:11.432 --> 15:17.351
♪ How sweet the sound

15:17.394 --> 15:21.659
♪ That saved a wretch...

Ow! Ow!

15:24.488 --> 15:25.925
[chokes]

15:27.578 --> 15:31.974
That was awesome!

15:32.018 --> 15:34.803
You see? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.544
Yeah, but now it's really past
your bedtime,

15:36.587 --> 15:38.067
so we got to clean up.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.939
MALCOLM:
Yeah.Actually, I'm pretty tired

15:39.982 --> 15:42.854
from slaying dragons.
Good night.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.291
Whoa, whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.683
So we got to clean
this mess...

15:45.727 --> 15:47.076
Silence, peasants!Wha...

15:50.471 --> 15:52.908
You should've let him play
on that iPad.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.347
[chuckles]
You know,

15:57.391 --> 16:00.872
I'm gonna have my yacht guy
give you a call, okay?

16:02.874 --> 16:04.920
What the hell, Dave?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.922
Bancroft outbid me.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.576
I thought you were supposed
to be watching the sheet.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.273
Ooh, I'm sorry.

16:10.317 --> 16:14.495
I was watching Gemma
absolutely crush her speech.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.758
Dave, forget
about Gemma right now.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.066
You need to focus
on what's important.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.546
And it's only a little bit of
time left to bid on this thing.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.113
And I need to win this

16:24.157 --> 16:26.072
to let my brother Curtis know

16:26.115 --> 16:28.596
which of us is the real baller
in the family,

16:28.639 --> 16:30.902
you know?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.513
And to show
my mother I love her.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.297
Yeah.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.734
Okay. What do you want to do?

16:36.778 --> 16:39.476
Well, first, I'm gonna
write down my final bid.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.217
"Chadwick Butler..."

16:41.261 --> 16:42.131
Don't ask.

16:43.698 --> 16:48.137
"A whole lot of money
and one cent."

16:48.181 --> 16:50.226
Look, and then
we need to make sure

16:50.270 --> 16:51.619
that this Bancroft character
doesn't come over here

16:51.662 --> 16:52.881
and bid again.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.448
How you want to do that?

16:54.491 --> 16:55.971
Look, I got an idea.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.930
Hey, thank you so much.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.411
You're gonna eat this and you're
gonna pretend to choke.

17:01.455 --> 17:05.024
Then Dr. Bancroft will have
to come over here and save you.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.287
It's the law.

17:07.330 --> 17:11.160
Calvin, I am not gonna
pretend to choke myself

17:11.204 --> 17:13.119
just so you can outdo
your brother.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.772
You know, the two of
you could really benefit

17:14.816 --> 17:17.079
from one of my conflict
mediation sessions.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.820
This is crazy.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.648
You know what's crazy, Dave?

17:20.691 --> 17:23.129
Is me walking around here
pretending I'm rich.

17:23.172 --> 17:27.133
I am sick of people with money
trying to make me seem small.

17:27.176 --> 17:30.136
I mean, Dr. Bancroft,
my brother Curtis.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.964
Look-- I work as hard as anybody
else and I need this win, Dave.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.406
[sighs]

17:39.449 --> 17:41.886
All right, Calvin. Choke me.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.628
Come on.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.328
Hey, this man
is choking!

17:48.371 --> 17:50.591
Is there a doctor in the house?

17:50.634 --> 17:52.549
I believe, legally,
you have to step forward.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.334
Dave.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.814
Dave, you're putting it on
a little thick.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.773
Okay?

17:58.816 --> 18:01.428
Are you choking--
are you choking for real?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.864
Come on, man.
[grunts]

18:02.907 --> 18:04.692
Come on, Dave. Come on, buddy.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.042
Oh.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.609
Oh, Dave.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.133
[moans]

18:11.177 --> 18:14.484
Is everything all right?
I heard someone was choking.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.138
Yeah, everything's fine.
We're good.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.879
Okay, get some air in there.Good.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.750
Oh.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.492
Just in the nick of time.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.799
Congratulations,
Dr. Bancroft.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.453
Thank you.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.461
Bancroft!

18:40.945 --> 18:42.686
There you are.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.558
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.951
I've just been in here
raking the Zen garden.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.693
It's supposed to help you
achieve tranquility.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.042
Is it working?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.392
[cries]:
Yes.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.090
Aw.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.223
Sweetie, it's okay.[groans]

18:57.266 --> 18:59.268
I'm so embarrassed.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.922
I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.141
You don't have
to be embarrassed.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.143
That Billy Joel thing worked.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.493
Apparently, he does for y'all
what Stevie Wonder does for us.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.801
I'm not talking
about my speech.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.760
I'm talking about this school.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.196
What do you mean?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.720
I was so excited to
show you this place.

19:16.764 --> 19:20.681
But now that I have, I realize
how silly it all must seem.

19:20.724 --> 19:24.206
Yeah, most schools I've been to
keep their sandboxes outside.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.121
[chuckles]

19:26.165 --> 19:28.036
Yeah, the janitors
hate this room.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.691
[chuckles]

19:30.734 --> 19:32.693
Look, Gemma,
I don't think you're silly.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.477
I think you're an idealist.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.696
And that's a good thing.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.480
The world needs more dreamers.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.830
But dreams aren't real life.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.050
Not yet.
But you can't make progress

19:42.093 --> 19:44.095
without having a dream first.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.097
I mean, look, Gemma, you've
been here all of a few months,

19:46.141 --> 19:48.752
and you're
just getting started.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.407
Yeah, but now I'm not sure
that it's even possible.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.104
[sighs]
Gemma,

19:53.148 --> 19:55.194
progress doesn't
happen overnight,

19:55.237 --> 19:57.108
but dreams do.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.024
Tina, that's amazing.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.504
Thank you.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.853
Did you just make that up?

20:02.897 --> 20:04.203
Hell no. It's written
on the wall over there.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.084
And now for the final prize
of the evening,

20:16.127 --> 20:19.261
the Oprah Super Soul Sunday
package.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.525
And the winner is...

20:22.569 --> 20:23.961
Chadwick Butler!

20:24.005 --> 20:25.485
[applause]

20:25.528 --> 20:27.748
What?

20:27.791 --> 20:29.619
How'd that happen?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.665
I talked to Bancroft.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.449
Turns out he's having
marital problems,

20:33.493 --> 20:35.973
so I offered him
some conflict mediation sessions

20:36.017 --> 20:38.541
if he withdrew his bid
on the Oprah package.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.891
[chuckles]
Dave, you did that for me?

20:40.935 --> 20:43.764
Well, I did it for us.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.506
Us? What do you get out of it?

20:49.639 --> 20:50.205
Say cheese.
