THAT'S MY SISTER ELAINE
WHEN SHE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.800
OH, COUSIN,
IS THAT YOU?

01:44.833 --> 01:47.033
YEAH.

01:47.066 --> 01:50.066
WHY YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY HAIR?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.633
WELL, ELAINE WAS IN
A FIRST GRADE PRODUCTION

01:52.666 --> 01:54.300
OF SAMSON AND DELILAH,

01:54.333 --> 01:57.300
AND SHE'D REHEARSE WITH ME
WHEN I WAS ASLEEP.

02:01.100 --> 02:04.333
WHY IS YOUR ARM
IN A CAST?

02:04.366 --> 02:09.300
WE HAD THIS
BIG OAK TREE
IN OUR BACK YARD.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.699
THERE WERE
NINE OF US KIDS.

02:10.733 --> 02:13.366
WE WERE ALL 12
BEFORE WE CLIMBED IT.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.700
EXCEPT ELAINE.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.066
SHE CLIMBED IT
WHEN SHE WAS 8.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.100
MY PARENTS LEFT ME
TO BABYSIT ELAINE.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.766
I WAS DOING
EXTRA CREDIT WORK
FOR ALGEBRA

02:22.800 --> 02:24.600
WHEN I HEAR,
"HELP ME!"

02:24.633 --> 02:27.466
ELAINE'S STUCK
IN THE TOP OF THE TREE.

02:27.500 --> 02:32.100
SHE GOT THERE
ALL BY HERSELF.

02:32.133 --> 02:35.433
OF COURSE, I HAD
TO HELP HER DOWN.

02:35.466 --> 02:37.033
I FELL
OUT OF THE TREE.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.633
BROKE MY ARM.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.300
NEVER DID GET
THE EXTRA CREDIT.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.400
WHO IS THIS NICE MAN
WITH THE MUSTACHE?

02:48.433 --> 02:52.033
OH, THAT'S MRS. BARR,
OUR PIANO TEACHER.

02:54.733 --> 02:55.600
YOU TOOK
PIANO LESSONS?

02:55.633 --> 02:57.266
WE ALL DID.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.066
ELAINE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO STUCK WITH IT.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.633
LITTLE ELAINE'S
GROWN UP

03:01.666 --> 03:03.633
AND ABOUT TO
START COLLEGE.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.200
I'M SO PROUD OF HER.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.666
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:06.700 --> 03:08.666
IT'S HER!
IT'S HER!

03:15.166 --> 03:16.433
OOH, NOOGIE!

03:16.466 --> 03:17.500
ELAINE!

03:19.333 --> 03:21.800
OH, AND YOU
MUST BE BALKI.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.033
I'M SO HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.

03:24.066 --> 03:26.700
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

03:26.733 --> 03:31.466
OH, NOOGIE, THIS
IS A GREAT PLACE.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.466
THANKS. YOU'RE THE FIRST
IN THE FAMILY TO SEE IT.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.633
AND WHAT AM I,
MASHED POTATOES?

03:37.666 --> 03:40.166
OKAY, THE SECOND.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.266
THE FIRST MEMBER
OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.666
WELL, I'M
HONORED, NOOGIE.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.466
QUESTION.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.166
WHY DO YOU
CALL HIM NOOGIE?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.600
NO, ELAINE.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.233
NO! NO!

03:52.266 --> 03:54.466
NOOGIE!

03:56.133 --> 03:57.466
THAT'S A NOOGIE,
BALKI.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.333
I SEE.

03:58.366 --> 04:00.100
YOU HAD TO ASK.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.333
BALKI,
I WANT TO HEAR

04:02.366 --> 04:05.533
ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK OF
AMERICA.

04:05.566 --> 04:07.333
HAVE YOU TRIED
SUSHI YET?

04:07.366 --> 04:08.766
NO, NOT YET.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.300
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A RACKET.

04:12.733 --> 04:14.666
IS HE ALWAYS
THIS ADORABLE?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.366
ALWAYS.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.666
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE VISITING

04:18.700 --> 04:19.666
BEFORE YOU
START SCHOOL.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.100
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.266
OH, HEY,
I UNDERSTAND.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.166
FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE
IS ALWAYS THE TOUGHEST.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.333
REMEMBER, EVERYBODY'S
IN THE SAME BOAT.

04:31.366 --> 04:34.766
I'M NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED
ABOUT COLLEGE.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.766
WELL,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.666
IS SHE SOMETHING,
OR WHAT?

04:38.700 --> 04:40.800
BEFORE YOU POP OPEN
THE CHAMPAGNE,

04:40.833 --> 04:44.800
I'VE DECIDED
TO GO TO NEW YORK.

04:44.833 --> 04:48.600
OOH! NEW YORK!
THE BIG TOMATO!

04:51.833 --> 04:54.133
THE BIG APPLE.

04:55.428 --> 04:58.028
YOU'RE GOING TO NEW YORK BEFORE
SCHOOL?

04:58.595 --> 04:59.795
NO.

04:59.828 --> 05:00.962
INSTEAD OF SCHOOL.

05:03.962 --> 05:05.762
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO COLLEGE?

05:05.795 --> 05:08.695
I SENT A TAPE OF MY LAST PIANO
RECITAL

05:08.728 --> 05:09.962
TO A TEACHER
IN NEW YORK.

05:09.995 --> 05:11.495
HE INVITED ME
TO STUDY WITH HIM.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.662
SO, I FIGURED
COLLEGE CAN WAIT.

05:13.695 --> 05:16.328
COLLEGE COULD WAIT?

05:16.362 --> 05:19.062
ELAINE,
PLANS HAVE BEEN MADE.

05:19.095 --> 05:20.328
THIS IS GOING
TO THROW OFF

05:20.362 --> 05:21.795
YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S
SCHEDULE!

05:21.828 --> 05:22.895
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

05:22.928 --> 05:24.962
I'M NOT ON A SCHEDULE.

05:24.995 --> 05:28.628
I HAVE TO SEE
IF I CAN MAKE IT

05:28.662 --> 05:30.395
AS A PROFESSIONAL
MUSICIAN.

05:30.428 --> 05:32.528
WELL, WE WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST.

05:32.562 --> 05:34.395
NO, WE DON'T.

05:36.595 --> 05:38.995
I KNOW YOU'RE
A SWELL PIANO PLAYER,

05:39.028 --> 05:41.695
BUT NEW YORK?

05:41.728 --> 05:44.495
I MEAN, THAT'S THE CRAZIEST
IDEA YOU'VE EVER HAD!

05:45.928 --> 05:48.528
WOW, I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU'D BE ON MY SIDE.

05:48.562 --> 05:50.762
YOU SOUND
LIKE MOM AND DAD.

05:50.795 --> 05:53.695
WELL, IF YOU MEAN THEY DON'T
AGREE YOU GO TO NEW YORK

05:53.728 --> 05:54.795
YES, I HAPPEN TO
AGREE WITH THEM.

05:54.828 --> 05:56.795
BUT I DON'T.
IT'S MY LIFE.

05:56.828 --> 05:58.462
THAT'S
A GOOD POINT.

06:00.395 --> 06:02.595
UH, IT'S BEEN
A REALLY LONG DRIVE.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.528
I'D LIKE
TO GO WASH UP.

06:04.562 --> 06:08.295
COUSIN, OUR BATHROOM,
IT'S ON THE LEFT.

06:08.328 --> 06:09.795
IT'S VERY MODERN.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.328
IT'S INDOORS.

06:20.528 --> 06:22.995
OH, I REALLY BLEW THAT.

06:23.028 --> 06:25.728
SHE WON'T LISTEN
TO ME NOW.

06:25.762 --> 06:28.262
SHE'D RATHER TAKE ADVICE
FROM A TOTAL STRANGER.

06:42.062 --> 06:44.295
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

06:45.862 --> 06:46.962
BALKI.

06:46.995 --> 06:48.328
WHAT?

06:48.362 --> 06:52.028
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
SAVE ELAINE.

06:52.062 --> 06:53.862
HOW I CAN DO THAT?

06:53.895 --> 06:55.762
TAKE HER OUT TO DINNER,

06:55.795 --> 06:57.528
LISTEN TO HER
FOR A WHILE,

06:57.562 --> 06:58.995
THEN TELL HER SHE
SHOULDN'T GO TO NEW YORK.

07:01.062 --> 07:03.428
YOU'RE THE FAMILY'S
LAST HOPE.

07:03.462 --> 07:04.795
WE'RE DEPENDING ON YOU.

07:04.828 --> 07:05.962
YOU CAN'T LET US DOWN.

07:07.662 --> 07:09.628
IS THIS WHAT THEY
CALL A GUILT TRIP?

07:09.662 --> 07:11.028
YES, IT IS.

07:13.762 --> 07:14.662
YOU GOOD AT IT.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.495
OH, YES, I AM.

07:22.795 --> 07:24.562
COUSIN, WE'RE HOME!

07:24.595 --> 07:28.495
OKAY, NOW, YOU STAND
RIGHT THERE,

07:28.528 --> 07:29.828
AND I'LL GET COUSIN...

07:29.862 --> 07:30.962
WAIT! I CHANGED MY MIND.

07:30.995 --> 07:32.895
I CAN'T DO IT.

07:32.928 --> 07:34.995
BUT COUSIN, YOU HAVE TO.

07:35.028 --> 07:37.795
TELL HIM YOUR DREAM
OF BECOMING A MUSICIAN

07:37.828 --> 07:39.495
LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

07:39.528 --> 07:42.528
YOU CONVINCED ME YOU
SHOULD GO TO NEW YORK.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.862
AND YOU CAN CONVINCE HIM.

07:43.895 --> 07:47.395
BUT I TRIED THIS AFTERNOON,
AND HE DIDN'T LISTEN.

07:47.428 --> 07:48.862
BALKI, YOU TELL HIM.

07:48.895 --> 07:49.862
PLEASE? PLEASE?

07:49.895 --> 07:51.395
NO, NO.

07:51.428 --> 07:53.795
PLEASE, BALKI.
YOU TELL HIM, PLEASE.

07:53.828 --> 07:55.428
PLEASE, PLEASE...
PLEASE, PLEASE!

07:55.462 --> 07:56.628
DON'T SEND ME ON
ANOTHER GUILT TRIP.

08:01.062 --> 08:02.795
OH, WE'RE BACK.

08:02.828 --> 08:04.795
DID WE HAVE
A GOOD TIME?

08:04.828 --> 08:06.762
WELL, WE...
YOU WEREN'T THERE,

08:06.795 --> 08:07.995
BUT WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

08:10.095 --> 08:12.662
YOU PROBABLY HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO TALK.

08:12.695 --> 08:14.895
YEAH, WE DID.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.662
I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR
WHAT YOU SAID.

08:16.695 --> 08:18.795
YOU MADE A LOT OF SENSE.
GREAT GUY.

08:19.928 --> 08:21.362
WHAT DID YOU
TALK ABOUT?

08:21.395 --> 08:23.895
BALKI'S GOING TO
TELL YOU ABOUT THAT NOW

08:23.928 --> 08:25.562
BECAUSE I'M JUST SO
TIRED. GOODNIGHT.

08:28.728 --> 08:29.595
GOODNIGHT.

08:33.695 --> 08:34.761
YOU MADE A LOT OF SENSE?

08:34.794 --> 08:36.462
I SHOULD SAY SO.

08:36.495 --> 08:37.995
YOU WORKED EVERYTHING OUT?
I GUESS SO.

08:38.028 --> 08:39.495
SHE'S GOING TO COLLEGE?

08:39.528 --> 08:40.962
WELL, WE GOT TO
TALK ABOUT THAT.

08:42.595 --> 08:45.295
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

08:45.328 --> 08:48.295
I STARTED OFF
BY LETTING HER TELL ME

08:48.328 --> 08:49.562
ALL HER REASONS
FOR GOING TO NEW YORK.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.928
GOOD. VERY GOOD.
YOU JUST LET HER TALK.

08:51.962 --> 08:54.295
JUST LET HER TALK.

08:54.328 --> 08:55.295
GENIUS.

08:55.328 --> 08:56.295
OH.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.462
GENIUS. I MEAN IT.
I MEAN IT.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.262
WELL, THEN WHAT
DID YOU SAY?

09:05.895 --> 09:08.928
OH, WHAT DID I SAY?
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

09:08.962 --> 09:09.995
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
BRILLIANT.

09:10.028 --> 09:12.595
WELL, I KNOW
SHE THOUGHT SO.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.295
WHAT DID I SAY?

09:14.328 --> 09:16.295
WHAT WERE
MY EXACT WORDS?

09:16.328 --> 09:17.595
I...

09:17.628 --> 09:19.662
I THINK I SAID,

09:19.695 --> 09:22.428
"YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM
LIKE YOU, UH...

09:22.462 --> 09:24.362
"KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:24.395 --> 09:27.962
YOU SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR DREAM AND
GO TO NEW YORK."

09:37.062 --> 09:38.028
THEN WHAT?

09:39.928 --> 09:41.328
AND THEN I SAID,

09:41.362 --> 09:42.495
"CHECK, PLEASE."

09:43.995 --> 09:45.928
BALKI! BALKI, I...

09:49.662 --> 09:51.328
ELAINE.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.428
THIS IS MY FAULT.

09:57.462 --> 09:59.528
TO PUT OUT A FIRE YOU
DON'T SEND A PYROMANIAC.

10:12.928 --> 10:14.428
YOUR COFFEE?

10:16.428 --> 10:17.828
FUNNY.

10:17.862 --> 10:20.728
HE NEVER ASKS FOR A
SECOND CUP OF MY COFFEE.

10:27.495 --> 10:29.628
HE'S STILL POUTING.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.595
YEAH, HE'S ONE OF THE BEST.

10:31.628 --> 10:33.695
COME ON, NOOGIE,
YOU'RE ACTING CHILDISH.

10:33.728 --> 10:35.028
CHILDISH?

10:35.062 --> 10:38.395
YEAH.

10:38.428 --> 10:40.762
I'M ACTING CHILDISH?

10:40.795 --> 10:42.528
NO.

10:45.428 --> 10:49.362
I THINK IF I WERE TO RUN OF TO
THE YUKON TO PEN FOR GOLD

10:49.395 --> 10:50.895
THAT WOULD BE CHILDISH.

10:52.895 --> 10:55.828
OR IF I WERE TO SAIL
OFF TO THE CARIBBEAN

10:55.862 --> 10:57.562
IN SEARCH OF SUNKEN TREASURE

10:57.595 --> 10:59.795
THAT WOULD BE CHILDISH.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.862
OH..

11:02.895 --> 11:07.662
OR, IF I WERE TO DROP
ALL MY RESPONSIBILITIES

11:07.695 --> 11:10.762
AND RUN OF TO SAY, NEW YORK

11:10.795 --> 11:14.328
TO BECOME A MUSICIAN

11:14.362 --> 11:17.562
THAT WOULD BE CHILDISH.

11:17.595 --> 11:19.662
OR IF YOU WERE TO GO THE OPERA

11:19.695 --> 11:23.295
DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT
SPIDERMAN UNDERWEAR

11:23.328 --> 11:24.928
NOW THAT WOULD BE CHILDISH.

11:31.095 --> 11:32.528
NOW YOU DO ONE.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.428
I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

11:38.462 --> 11:40.495
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.662
YOU'RE UPSET, HUH?

12:10.695 --> 12:13.395
ME, UPSET? NO.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.762
DON'T BE SILLY.

12:14.795 --> 12:15.962
WHY SHOULD I BE
UPSET JUST BECAUSE

12:15.995 --> 12:17.562
MY BEST FRIEND
STABBED ME IN THE BACK?

12:19.495 --> 12:20.862
JUST BECAUSE HE
UNDERMINED EVERYTHING

12:20.895 --> 12:23.428
I WAS TRYING TO DO
TO PROTECT A CHILD

12:23.462 --> 12:24.828
FROM HELL‐TOWN?

12:27.095 --> 12:28.928
NO, COUSIN

12:28.962 --> 12:31.862
SHE HAS DECIDED SHE
WANT TO GO TO NEW YORK

12:31.895 --> 12:35.562
TO STUDY WITH A FAMOUS
TEACHER OF PIANO.

12:35.595 --> 12:39.762
SHE WANTS TO BE
A CONCERT PIANIST.

12:39.795 --> 12:43.562
HER DREAM IS TO PLAY
WITH PHIL'S HARMONICA.

12:54.495 --> 12:57.062
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

12:57.095 --> 12:58.495
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

12:59.662 --> 13:02.528
COUSIN, YOU AND YOUR SISTER MUST
TALK.

13:02.562 --> 13:03.962
NO, WE MUSTN'T.

13:03.995 --> 13:05.595
YOU MUST. LISTEN.

13:05.628 --> 13:06.995
NO, I WON'T LISTEN.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.728
JUST ONE THING.

13:08.762 --> 13:10.528
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.

13:22.562 --> 13:23.828
THANK YOU.

13:27.062 --> 13:28.362
NO! BALKI.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.795
NOW, LISTEN UP.

13:29.828 --> 13:31.562
YOUR SISTER
HAVE GOOD REASONS

13:31.595 --> 13:32.762
FOR WANTING TO
GO TO NEW YORK.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.962
JUST BECAUSE I CAN HEAR YOU,
DOESN'T MEAN I'M LISTENING.

13:37.762 --> 13:39.528
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK TO HER,

13:39.562 --> 13:41.462
AT LEAST YOU WON'T RUIN
HER LAST NIGHT HERE.

13:41.495 --> 13:42.628
BALKI, LET ME GO.

13:42.662 --> 13:44.795
NOT A CHANCE.

13:44.828 --> 13:45.962
ALRIGHT, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

13:45.995 --> 13:47.695
I WANT YOU TO
TAKE US TO DINNER.

13:47.728 --> 13:48.695
NO.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.462
OOH! AH!

13:52.562 --> 13:54.728
ALRIGHT.
ALRIGHT. 8:00.

13:54.762 --> 13:57.395
I WANT YOU TO BE NICE
TO YOUR SISTER.

13:57.428 --> 13:59.062
OKAY, I'LL BE NICE
TO MY SISTER.

13:59.095 --> 14:00.662
NOW, PUT ME DOWN!

14:08.362 --> 14:09.828
NOW, COUSIN...

14:15.028 --> 14:16.562
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE FUN.

14:16.595 --> 14:18.495
I DIDN'T AGREE
TO HAVE FUN.

14:18.528 --> 14:20.862
ALRIGHT!
I'LL HAVE FUN.

14:20.895 --> 14:21.995
GOOD.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.595
FINE.

14:49.728 --> 14:51.595
NOOGIE, THANKS FOR TAKING US OUT
TO DINNER.

14:51.628 --> 14:52.762
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:52.795 --> 14:55.462
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

14:59.795 --> 15:01.628
BALKI, THERE'S A LARGE,
SCARY MAN COMING OUR WAY.

15:03.495 --> 15:04.595
BALKI!

15:04.628 --> 15:07.028
LEROY, MY MAN!

15:07.062 --> 15:08.595
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

15:08.628 --> 15:10.062
GET DOWN.

15:10.095 --> 15:11.495
LANIE.

15:11.528 --> 15:13.995
HOW YOU DOING, LEROY?

15:14.028 --> 15:15.795
MEET MY BROTHER LARRY.

15:15.828 --> 15:16.862
NOOGIE!

15:16.895 --> 15:18.428
HOW YOU DOING?

15:18.462 --> 15:20.962
HOW DO YOU DO,
MR. LEROY.

15:20.995 --> 15:21.862
UH...

15:23.628 --> 15:24.895
HEY, BROTHER.

15:24.928 --> 15:26.528
GOT YOU THE BEST TABLE
IN THE HOUSE.

15:26.562 --> 15:27.728
THANK YOU.
FOLLOW ME.

15:29.095 --> 15:29.995
PSST. PSST.

15:37.928 --> 15:39.428
ENJOY.

15:39.462 --> 15:40.762
THANK YOU.

15:40.795 --> 15:43.295
FIRST ROUND'S
ON ME, OKAY, BABE?

15:43.328 --> 15:44.695
TALK TO YOU LATER.

15:44.728 --> 15:47.862
SO, YOU TWO
CAME HERE LAST NIGHT?

15:47.895 --> 15:49.728
YOU'D THINK THEY'D HAVE
A NO‐SMOKING SECTION.

15:51.828 --> 15:54.695
CHILL OUT, BRO.
THIS PLACE IS BAD.

15:56.328 --> 15:58.328
IT WAS MY IDEA.

15:58.362 --> 16:00.628
I READ ABOUT ROLLING STONE
THEY HAVE GREAT JAZZ.

16:00.662 --> 16:01.762
OH, GREAT!

16:01.795 --> 16:03.462
GREAT, WHO NEEDS TO GO
TO NEW YORK?

16:03.495 --> 16:04.995
YOU CAN THROW YOUR
LIFE AWAY RIGHT HERE.

16:07.995 --> 16:09.962
COUSIN, WE CAME HERE

16:09.995 --> 16:12.862
SO YOU COULD BE NICE
TO YOUR SISTER. REMEMBER?

16:12.895 --> 16:14.628
OKAY. ELAINE, I'M SORRY.

16:14.662 --> 16:16.795
I'M TRYING TO BE NICE.

16:16.828 --> 16:18.362
I START SAYING NICE THINGS,

16:18.395 --> 16:20.995
BUT THESE NASTY THINGS KEEP
COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH.

16:24.095 --> 16:26.695
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO MESS UP YOUR LIFE.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.628
OH, I GET IT.

16:30.662 --> 16:32.395
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN MAKE IT

16:32.428 --> 16:33.862
AS A CLASSICAL
PIANIST, DO YOU?

16:33.895 --> 16:35.828
ELAINE, FACE REALITY.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.295
YOU MAY BE THE BEST
LITTLE PIANIST IN MADISON,

16:39.328 --> 16:40.695
BUT IN NEW YORK,

16:40.728 --> 16:42.928
THEY'LL CHEW YOU UP
AND SPIT YOU OUT.

16:42.962 --> 16:45.495
BUT COUSIN, IF SHE CAN
MAKE IT THERE,

16:45.528 --> 16:47.395
SHE'LL MAKE IT ANYWHERE.

16:47.428 --> 16:48.295
IT'S UP TO YOU...

16:48.328 --> 16:50.295
BALKI, PLEASE.

16:53.395 --> 16:54.862
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I CAN'T MAKE IT

16:54.895 --> 16:56.428
IF YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD ME PLAY?

16:56.462 --> 16:58.328
I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY.

16:58.362 --> 17:00.428
THE LAST TIME
YOU HEARD ME

17:00.462 --> 17:03.495
WAS MRS. BARS CLASS RECITAL
IN MY EIGHTH GRADE.

17:03.528 --> 17:05.462
IT CAN'T BE
THAT LONG AGO.

17:05.494 --> 17:06.694
IT WAS.

17:13.462 --> 17:15.795
ELAINE, I HAVE
A WONDERFUL IDEA.

17:15.828 --> 17:17.528
THERE'S A PIANO.

17:17.561 --> 17:18.962
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.428
AND THEN WE DON'T
HAVE TO ARGUE

17:20.462 --> 17:21.561
ABOUT WHETHER
YOU HEAR HER OR NOT.

17:22.928 --> 17:25.028
NO. ELAINE, COME BACK.

17:25.061 --> 17:28.762
ELAINE, I AM ORDERING YOU
TO STOP RIGHT NOW.

17:30.062 --> 17:31.495
HEY MAN, THE LADY
WANTS TO PLAY.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.995
LET HER PLAY.

17:33.028 --> 17:35.762
YES. I THINK THAT
WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL.

17:37.062 --> 17:38.728
COME ON, COUSIN.

17:38.762 --> 17:40.428
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

18:28.062 --> 18:29.528
I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

18:29.562 --> 18:31.928
YOU HAD THEM IN THE PALM OF YOUR
HAND.

18:31.962 --> 18:35.062
IT WAS SO NICE OF LEROY
TO OFFER YOU A JOB.

18:35.095 --> 18:37.928
IF PHIL'S HARMONICA
IS ANYTHING LIKE LEROY'S,

18:37.962 --> 18:38.828
YOU GOT IT MADE.

18:41.428 --> 18:42.428
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:42.462 --> 18:43.562
SHOULD I GO TO NEW YORK?

18:47.562 --> 18:49.462
WHAT I THINK
ISN'T IMPORTANT.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.895
YOU'RE GOING TO GO,
SO YOU'LL GO.

18:51.928 --> 18:52.962
GOOD LUCK.

18:54.028 --> 18:55.762
THANK YOU.

18:55.795 --> 18:57.495
WELL, I'M LEAVING
EARLY TOMORROW,

18:57.528 --> 18:58.895
SO I'LL JUST TURN IN.

18:58.928 --> 19:00.295
YEAH.

19:00.328 --> 19:01.562
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
SLEEPY ON THE ROAD.

19:01.595 --> 19:03.328
NO. GOODNIGHT GUYS.

19:03.362 --> 19:04.328
GOODNIGHT.

19:08.562 --> 19:11.328
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY TO HER?

19:11.362 --> 19:13.962
"GOOD LUCK. DON'T GET SLEEPY ON
THE ROAD"?

19:17.095 --> 19:18.595
CAN YOU AFFORD IT?

19:22.928 --> 19:24.428
SHE DOESN'T CARE
WHAT I THINK.

19:25.562 --> 19:27.762
(SPEAKING MYPOSIAN)

19:39.095 --> 19:40.395
"GOOD LUCK.
DON'T GET SLEEPY."

19:40.428 --> 19:41.528
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

19:44.528 --> 19:47.828
NOW, WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

19:47.862 --> 19:50.395
WHY DO YOU THINK
ELAINE COME TO VISIT US?

19:50.428 --> 19:52.828
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

19:52.862 --> 19:55.362
SHE COULD HAVE GONE DIRECTLY
TO THE BIG PINEAPPLE.

19:57.528 --> 19:59.928
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE COME HERE?

19:59.962 --> 20:02.695
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON IN HER LIFE.

20:02.728 --> 20:04.928
SHE NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE IN HER.

20:04.962 --> 20:08.828
I BELIEVE IN HER,
BUT I WORRY ABOUT HER.

20:08.862 --> 20:11.295
I MEAN SUPPOSE SHE CHASES
THIS DREAM,

20:11.328 --> 20:12.662
AND IT DOESN'T COME TRUE.

20:12.695 --> 20:13.995
SHE'LL BE SHATTERED.

20:14.028 --> 20:17.428
YOU'RE CHASING YOU DREAM
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER.

20:17.462 --> 20:19.395
I'M CHASING MY DREAM
TO BE AN AMERICAN.

20:19.428 --> 20:20.928
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS?

20:20.962 --> 20:24.295
THE DIFFERENCE IS
SHE'S MY BABY SISTER.

20:24.328 --> 20:28.062
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE
CHASE THEIR DREAMS!

20:28.095 --> 20:30.495
ISN'T IT BETTER
TO TRY AND FAIL

20:30.528 --> 20:31.795
THAN NOT EVEN
TO TRY AT ALL?

20:34.028 --> 20:35.895
OKAY. OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:35.928 --> 20:39.328
SHE'S NOT
A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

20:42.028 --> 20:44.395
BOY, LEAVE HOME
FOR A WHILE,

20:44.428 --> 20:45.762
AND THEY GROW UP ON YOU.

20:47.828 --> 20:49.062
YOU DO BELIEVE IN HER?

20:49.095 --> 20:50.595
YES.

20:50.628 --> 20:51.962
YOU DO LOVE HER?

20:51.995 --> 20:53.362
YES.

20:54.528 --> 20:55.928
WHY YOU DON'T TELL HER?

20:59.628 --> 21:01.728
WELL, SHE'S ALREADY
GONE TO BED,

21:01.762 --> 21:04.062
AND SHE'S LEAVING
EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.

21:04.095 --> 21:05.295
BALKI.

21:05.328 --> 21:07.395
BALKI.

21:07.428 --> 21:08.628
COUSIN ELAINE,

21:08.662 --> 21:10.628
COUSIN LARRY HAS
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

21:10.662 --> 21:13.528
OH, NOW,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

21:13.562 --> 21:15.062
BECAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID TO.

21:15.095 --> 21:15.962
NO, I'M NOT.

21:18.728 --> 21:21.628
WELL, SORRY. I HOPE
WE DIDN'T WAKE YOU.

21:21.662 --> 21:23.428
OH, NO.
I WAS JUST PACKING.

21:28.028 --> 21:29.862
WELL, IF YOU NEED HELP,
LET ME KNOW.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.328
I TELL YOU WHO
NEEDS SOME HELP.

21:37.995 --> 21:38.795
YOU DO.

21:41.695 --> 21:42.662
AND YOU DO.

21:45.828 --> 21:48.328
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO HER,

21:48.362 --> 21:49.562
AND YOU ASK ME TO DO IT.

21:51.762 --> 21:53.795
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO HIM,

21:53.828 --> 21:55.428
AND YOU ASK ME TO DO IT.

21:56.928 --> 21:59.528
SHAME ON YOU.

21:59.562 --> 22:01.895
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE,

22:01.928 --> 22:04.295
AND YOU STINGY WITH IT,

22:04.328 --> 22:05.995
WITH EACH OTHER,

22:06.028 --> 22:07.928
WHO ARE YOU SAVING IT FOR?

22:13.462 --> 22:15.795
NOW, YOU STAND
RIGHT THERE

22:15.828 --> 22:17.328
UNTIL YOU SAY
WHAT YOU FEEL.

22:30.495 --> 22:32.395
SO, YOU'RE PACKING, HUH?

22:32.428 --> 22:33.762
YEAH. PACKING.

22:37.362 --> 22:38.928
BE SURE TO PUT THE BIG STUFF ON
THE BOTTOM.

22:41.895 --> 22:42.762
I DID.

22:46.395 --> 22:48.495
YOU REMEMBER
THAT OAK TREE THING?

22:48.528 --> 22:49.662
YEAH.

22:52.795 --> 22:56.462
IF I HAD KNOWN I WAS
GOING TO BREAK MY ARM

22:56.495 --> 22:57.762
BEFORE I CLIMBED UP
TO GET YOU...

23:00.928 --> 23:02.562
I WOULD HAVE
DONE IT ANYWAY.

23:03.995 --> 23:05.595
REALLY?

23:05.628 --> 23:06.762
YEAH.

23:08.395 --> 23:10.495
WELL, UM...

23:10.528 --> 23:13.428
THE ONLY REASON
I CLIMBED THAT TREE

23:13.462 --> 23:17.328
WAS SO YOU'D SEE WHAT
A GOOD CLIMBER I WAS.

23:17.362 --> 23:18.995
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS
DID SILLY STUFF.

23:19.028 --> 23:20.595
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO NOTICE ME.

23:22.462 --> 23:25.928
WELL, I NOTICED YOU.

23:25.962 --> 23:28.695
IN FACT,
I KIND OF ADMIRED YOU

23:28.728 --> 23:30.395
FOR HAVING THE GUTS
TO TAKE CHANCES.

23:31.862 --> 23:33.728
BOY, YOU WOULD
DO ANYTHING.

23:36.028 --> 23:37.662
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED
TO CLIMB THAT TREE,

23:37.695 --> 23:38.928
BUT I NEVER
GOT UP THE NERVE

23:38.962 --> 23:40.428
UNTIL YOU GOT STUCK UP THERE.

23:41.928 --> 23:43.662
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU EVER CLIMBED A TREE?

23:48.695 --> 23:52.362
YEAH, BUT, UH, DON'T
TELL THE OTHER KIDS, OKAY?

23:52.395 --> 23:53.862
ESPECIALLY BILLY,

23:53.895 --> 23:57.028
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE MAKES
A BIG DEAL OUT OF EVERYTHING.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.762
I WON'T.

24:02.428 --> 24:05.962
WELL, LOOK, YOU'LL DO
JUST FINE IN NEW YORK,

24:05.995 --> 24:08.762
AND I'M SORRY I GAVE YOU
SUCH A ROUGH TIME.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.762
IT'S JUST THAT
I WORRY ABOUT YOU

24:10.795 --> 24:13.762
BECAUSE YOU WERE
ALWAYS MY FAVORITE.

24:16.562 --> 24:17.695
I WAS?

24:18.928 --> 24:20.762
YOU STILL ARE.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.528
I LOVE YOU, NOOGIE.

24:27.628 --> 24:28.628
I LOVE YOU TOO, ELAINE.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.262
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU!
