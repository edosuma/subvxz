02:03.924 --> 02:05.692
(doorbell rings)

02:14.501 --> 02:16.036
(doorbell rings)

02:25.345 --> 02:26.880
Keith?

02:26.913 --> 02:28.949
There's been...

02:31.618 --> 02:32.819
What's wrong?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.191
Where's Marsha?

02:38.224 --> 02:41.728
She's taking a shower.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.231
Why aren't you dressed?

02:46.533 --> 02:48.635
My clothes are in the wash.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.738
MARSHA: Keith.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.006
Put this on.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.243
Hello, Ellenor.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.579
Marsha.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.315
The master bedroom.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.618
Just go look.

03:16.129 --> 03:20.100
(music playing)

03:26.439 --> 03:28.575
Let me do the talking.
Just let me handle it.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.910
Don't you think you've
handled things enough, Keith?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.444
You want to lay
this at my door?

03:31.477 --> 03:32.713
Are you serious?
Shh.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.556
Have you called
an ambulance?

03:42.589 --> 03:46.192
He seems a little dead
for that.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.060
What about the police?

03:47.093 --> 03:49.162
We called you.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.197
Given the man
died in our house,

03:51.231 --> 03:52.766
we were nervous
about becoming suspects,

03:52.799 --> 03:55.569
so we notified
our attorney.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.538
So the police haven't been
called at all.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.205
Not yet, no.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.808
Do you know
who the victim is?

04:01.842 --> 04:05.145
His name is James McNoun.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.114
He's a business associate
of Marsha's.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.186
What happened?

04:13.219 --> 04:16.356
If knowing the truth
would prevent you

04:16.389 --> 04:19.159
from representing me,
Ellenor,

04:19.192 --> 04:20.627
you're not getting it.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.832
How you doing, sweetie?

04:25.866 --> 04:26.900
Okay.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.003
Hi, Ellenor.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.938
Hi, Allison.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.211
Okay, look, we have
to notify the police.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.646
And what do we tell them?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.815
Well--
KEITH: None of us has any idea

04:41.848 --> 04:42.516
how it happened.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.550
None of us saw it.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.388
FRUTT: He just showed up
in your bed dead?

04:48.421 --> 04:49.690
Yes.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.993
That's not going to sound
very convincing, Keith.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.262
Ellenor...

04:56.296 --> 04:58.364
I'm placing myself
in your hands now.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.001
I'll tell you as much
or as little

05:01.034 --> 05:03.804
as you want to know.
It's up to you.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.071
But I don't want to say
anything

05:05.105 --> 05:07.974
that will keep you
from representing me.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.077
So tell me what you want.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.826
You have blood
splatterings on you.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.093
Go take a shower.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.395
I'm going to call
the police in 10 minutes.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.616
(music playing)

06:31.357 --> 06:35.629
(indistinct chatters)

06:35.662 --> 06:39.600
(music playing)

06:55.816 --> 06:56.750
DONNELL: What happened?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.184
I don't exactly know.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.120
Did he tell you anything?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.856
Only that
I don't want to know.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.224
And my educated guess
is that he shot him.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.693
GAMBLE: Ellenor.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.761
Take a walk?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.097
Don't let anybody
speak to them.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.036
I'm told your clients
are refusing

07:16.069 --> 07:17.538
to give any statements.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.205
Choosing not to give
statements.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.609
Don't you think
it kind of makes them

07:22.643 --> 07:24.911
look suspicious?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.981
Well, then as suspects,
they're exercising

07:28.014 --> 07:29.415
their constitutional
rights to remain--

07:29.449 --> 07:31.785
Ellenor, I can't accept
anyone's version

07:31.818 --> 07:33.820
of the events
if no one gives me one.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.421
I sympathize, Helen,

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
but the burden
is on the state

07:36.990 --> 07:37.858
to figure out
what happened, not--

07:37.891 --> 07:39.593
And as a State Senator,
I would think

07:39.626 --> 07:41.795
your client would want
to assist the Commonwealth

07:41.828 --> 07:42.696
in that burden.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.097
Well, you would be wrong.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
(sighs)
You represent the wife

07:46.499 --> 07:47.734
and the daughter, too.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.502
That is correct.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.003
No conflict
of interest there.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.505
None.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.239
You're not going to let any
of them talk to us.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.708
Correct.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.211
How we doing?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.350
Arrest Senator Ellison

08:04.384 --> 08:06.352
and take the wife
into custody.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.120
Wait a second.

08:07.153 --> 08:07.888
You're arresting both?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.055
No, just him.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.356
Then why take her?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.094
As a material witness?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.496
The State, under
extraordinary circumstances,

08:16.530 --> 08:18.464
can place a witness
into custody if--

08:18.498 --> 08:20.466
What are your circumstances?

08:20.501 --> 08:21.868
We believe, Your Honor,
that Senator Ellison

08:21.902 --> 08:23.436
caught his wife in bed
with the victim,

08:23.469 --> 08:24.470
then shot him.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.039
Yes, what a gifted leap.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.241
What are your
circumstances for taking

08:28.274 --> 08:29.743
Mrs. Ellison into custody?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.244
We think she's concealing
evidence

08:31.277 --> 08:32.445
that she will destroy

08:32.477 --> 08:33.580
if she gets out of custody.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.616
The evidence being?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.650
The victim's semen
or DNA evidence

08:37.683 --> 08:38.818
that would establish
the two

08:38.852 --> 08:39.919
were in bed together
at the time.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.221
I'm a little confused here.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.389
What exactly
are you asking for?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.626
We'd like to do a search
similar to a rape kit

08:45.659 --> 08:48.194
examination to determine--
A vaginal search?

08:48.228 --> 08:51.064
A full-body search to look
for hairs and fibers.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.065
Helen!

08:52.098 --> 08:54.500
If your client
would cooperate, Ellenor,

08:54.535 --> 08:55.401
and give us a statement.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.804
By not doing so--
FRUTT: This is blatant

08:57.838 --> 08:58.972
blackmail, Your Honor.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.674
She is trying to force
my client

09:00.707 --> 09:02.609
to testify against her husband,

09:02.643 --> 09:05.646
or else be violated
by a police technician.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.247
Your client
is not a suspect.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.449
FRUTT: Fine. Then grant
her full immunity,

09:09.482 --> 09:10.751
and then we'll consider
any search.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.754
Would she agree to testify
in exchange for immunity?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.257
I am not making any deals

09:17.290 --> 09:18.925
under the threat
of coercion,

09:18.959 --> 09:20.927
and, I might add,
the State has no authority

09:20.961 --> 09:22.963
to do an invasive
bodily search.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.198
She is the suspect's wife.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.733
Spousal privilege--

09:26.767 --> 09:28.434
GAMBLE: That privilege
goes to testimony.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.771
Bodily fluids
do not constitute testimony.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.505
FRUTT: Come on!

09:31.538 --> 09:32.939
The privacy issues
alone here--

09:32.973 --> 09:34.775
Are outweighed
by the state's interest

09:34.808 --> 09:36.109
in solving a homicide.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.211
Whether or not she's
a suspect, Your Honor,

09:38.244 --> 09:40.714
if we do not get this evidence
tonight, it's gone.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.049
FINKEL: Ms. Gamble,
are you sure you want this?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.051
Because if it comes out
this is merely

09:45.085 --> 09:46.753
a ploy on your part,

09:46.787 --> 09:49.856
this woman can sue you
personally for misconduct.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.858
You'll lose whatever
evidence you might find.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.494
I can't lose evidence
I don't have, Your Honor.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.729
I want it.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.768
I'm going to allow it.
I appeal it and want--

10:01.802 --> 10:03.369
FINKEL: Fine.
But I'm not staying

10:03.403 --> 10:04.871
the order pending an appeal.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.841
And since
it's almost midnight...

10:15.582 --> 10:18.752
Hold a little still,
if you can.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.588
And people wonder if we're
becoming a police state.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.423
FRUTT: I'm going to be
all over them on this,

10:23.456 --> 10:24.991
I promise you, Marsha.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.360
WINTERS: Mrs. Ellison,

10:27.393 --> 10:29.429
if you could just remain still.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.831
This really shouldn't hurt.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.032
It shouldn't hurt?

10:32.065 --> 10:32.799
FRUTT: Marsha.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.300
A man was shot in my home.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.769
My husband was arrested.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.104
And Dr. Fingers
is down there with a snorkel.

10:38.138 --> 10:38.905
Would you describe this

10:38.939 --> 10:41.608
as a painless experience,
Ellenor?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.777
Let's just get through this.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.149
GAMBLE: Of course,
get them issued tonight.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.051
Wake the magistrate up
if you have to.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.722
...not been given
any details

10:55.756 --> 10:57.357
as to what happened
this evening.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.226
The police have issued
no statement as of yet,

11:00.260 --> 11:02.328
except to confirm that
a fatal shooting

11:02.362 --> 11:04.531
did take place
in the Senator's home,

11:04.565 --> 11:06.533
occurring sometime
this evening.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.169
Unconfirmed reports
suggest that the Senator

11:09.202 --> 11:11.271
was, in fact, home at the time.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.105
(knocks on door)

11:12.138 --> 11:14.407
WALSH: Helen, where are we?

11:15.709 --> 11:18.378
Uh, the Senator
is in custody.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.680
We have the gun.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.047
We're getting
the warrants issued

11:21.081 --> 11:22.415
to search his house tonight.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.485
He had his lawyers there
before the police, even.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.088
He's not talking,
and it's not likely to change.

11:28.121 --> 11:28.989
Uh-hmm.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.591
This is Alan Lowe.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.893
He just came over
from Middlesex.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.761
Hi. Why do I care?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.563
Because he's
your backup on this.

11:36.597 --> 11:40.000
Look, I don't need any--
I do.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.034
The heat on this
is already--

11:41.067 --> 11:43.970
Mr. Lowe's reputation
is that he has difficulty

11:44.004 --> 11:46.206
with the concept
of playing backup.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.508
WALSH: You're first chair,
Helen.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.676
He gets that.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.144
Use him, Helen.

11:52.613 --> 11:54.014
Keep me informed.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.558
Don't second-guess.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.826
Don't even talk.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.260
We'll get along just fine.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.563
You can start by overseeing
the warrants.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.665
Can I ask you why you made
an arrest so quickly?

12:11.698 --> 12:14.034
See, you're talking.
I'm not second-guessing.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.101
I'm just asking.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.375
The only way I could
search Mrs. Ellison

12:22.408 --> 12:24.578
was to make a showing
she's not a suspect.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.514
The best way of doing that
was to arrest the Senator.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.716
Anything else?

12:29.750 --> 12:31.552
No.
Great.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.586
Warrants.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.492
A cavity search?

12:39.526 --> 12:40.761
FRUTT: She called
Judge Finkel.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.295
And did they find
anything on her?

12:42.328 --> 12:43.229
I hope not.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.765
She took a shower
before the police came.

12:44.798 --> 12:45.799
The victim wore a condom.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.100
So maybe there was nothing.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.468
I also had Keith
take a shower,

12:48.502 --> 12:49.570
so he should be clean.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.173
DONNELL: What do you mean
you had Keith shower?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.175
You instructed him
to take a shower?

12:56.877 --> 12:57.844
Did I say that?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.580
Yes, you did.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.347
Well, I misspoke.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.150
I did not direct him
to take a shower.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.119
He independently
decided to.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.123
Lay off me, will you?

13:10.156 --> 13:11.892
If this was one of your
closest friends--

13:11.925 --> 13:12.993
You broke the law.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.896
I told you, Bobby,
I misspoke.

13:15.929 --> 13:16.897
It was his decision,

13:16.930 --> 13:18.965
and I have no
affirmative duty

13:18.999 --> 13:20.466
to prevent him
from bathing

13:20.500 --> 13:22.168
if that's what
he chose to do.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.306
Ellenor, because this is one
of your oldest friends,

13:26.339 --> 13:28.041
it makes me nervous.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.275
This is a State Senator.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.645
This case will be
under a microscope.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.014
If we cross any
ethical lines here--

13:34.047 --> 13:34.915
I won't.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.053
I won't.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.396
WOMAN (over PA):
Volunteer to admitting.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.932
Volunteer to admitting.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.802
Did you find what you
were looking for?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.138
Well, it'll take
a little time

13:58.171 --> 13:59.172
for them to analyze

13:59.205 --> 14:00.874
everything they found,
Mrs. Ellison.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.909
I just wanted to talk
to you for a minute.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.248
I'm represented by counsel,
Ms. Gamble.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.350
Yes, but you're not
a suspect,

14:10.383 --> 14:12.052
so whether you're
represented or not--

14:12.085 --> 14:13.453
So this isn't custodial?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.591
Once the examinations
are completed,

14:17.624 --> 14:18.692
you're free to go, yes.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.727
Does Ellenor Frutt
know you're here?

14:23.697 --> 14:27.200
Mrs. Ellison, we all know
what happened here.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.635
Has your attorney
explained to you

14:28.669 --> 14:30.136
that your silence
could incriminate you?

14:30.170 --> 14:32.673
Gee, no.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.907
But as you explain it,

14:33.940 --> 14:36.543
it seems I am indeed a suspect
of criminal wrongdoing,

14:36.577 --> 14:39.312
which makes this
interrogation improper,

14:39.345 --> 14:40.413
if not illegal.

14:40.446 --> 14:43.817
Okay, well, I guess what
I'm trying to say...

14:45.451 --> 14:47.320
you probably
won't be able to save

14:47.353 --> 14:48.622
your husband from his fate,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.390
but you may very well
hurt yourself

14:50.423 --> 14:52.292
and your daughter
in the process.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.628
Fine.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.262
And should you ever
lose your job

14:56.296 --> 14:59.666
for violating suspects' Fifth
and Sixth Amendment rights,

14:59.700 --> 15:02.068
perhaps you could tour
as a motivational speaker.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.572
You're being dismissive,
Mrs. Ellison.

15:05.606 --> 15:07.340
It would be a great error
in judgment

15:07.373 --> 15:08.975
for you to dismiss me.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.813
Maybe I shot him,
Ms. Gamble.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.682
There's your statement.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.325
WOMAN: We're told, Jenny,
that warrants

15:25.358 --> 15:26.527
were issued last night

15:26.560 --> 15:28.595
and that Senator Ellison's
office

15:28.629 --> 15:30.697
is being searched as we speak.

15:30.731 --> 15:33.033
The arraignment
was scheduled for 9:00.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.467
Whether that's been delayed
or not--

15:34.500 --> 15:35.335
MAN: Here they come!

15:35.368 --> 15:39.305
(indistinct chatter)

15:41.474 --> 15:42.843
No comment, please.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.278
Let him through!
Let him through.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.146
Let him through.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.181
MAN: Next matter
on the calendar,

15:48.214 --> 15:51.284
Criminal Case number 32723,

15:51.317 --> 15:52.819
Commonwealth vs. Keith Ellison,

15:52.853 --> 15:55.221
murder in the first degree.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.057
Ellenor Frutt for the defense.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.158
Good morning, Your Honor.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.693
Helen Gamble
for the Commonwealth,

15:59.726 --> 16:01.762
and that this is a first
degree homicide,

16:01.795 --> 16:04.798
we ask that Senator Ellison
be held without bail.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.568
FRUTT: My client has
no previous criminal record.

16:07.601 --> 16:10.704
He has strong and extensive
roots in the community.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.373
He is, in fact,
a trusted government official

16:13.406 --> 16:16.242
who poses neither a safety
nor flight risk.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.045
The defendant is being charged
with a brutal homicide.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.381
The fact that he is a State
Senator should afford him

16:21.414 --> 16:22.649
no special consideration.

16:22.683 --> 16:24.450
FRUTT: We are not asking
for favors.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.519
In fact, just the opposite.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.286
That he be treated the same--

16:26.319 --> 16:28.689
$1 million bond,
$250,000 cash.

16:28.722 --> 16:29.690
FRUTT: Thank you, Your Honor.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.858
We would also move
for an immediate trial.

16:31.892 --> 16:33.927
The prosecution needs time
to develop its case.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.495
An arrest has been made here.

16:35.529 --> 16:36.262
If the prosecution doesn't
have a case--

16:36.296 --> 16:38.031
I would appreciate
it if counsel

16:38.064 --> 16:39.499
could refrain
from posturing.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.635
What are you looking for?
December.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.103
They're looking to buy time,
Your Honor.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.471
I'd also appreciate it
if Defense Counsel

16:45.506 --> 16:47.774
could limit herself
to representing the defendant

16:47.808 --> 16:50.443
and not the Commonwealth's
intentions.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.613
FINKEL: Trial date
of September 24th.

16:52.646 --> 16:55.549
Let's conference tomorrow.
Set up a schedule.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.550
For now, we're adjourned.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.519
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
I'm loath to turn this into

16:58.552 --> 16:59.786
an unnecessary street
fight, but--

16:59.820 --> 17:01.888
Oh, yeah, she's so adverse
to confrontation.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.459
I believe counsel,
in her zealous efforts

17:06.492 --> 17:08.595
to provide legal representation
to the defendant,

17:08.628 --> 17:11.131
is guilty of witness
tampering or worse--

17:11.164 --> 17:13.433
obstruction of justice.
What?

17:13.465 --> 17:15.167
GAMBLE: We have been unable
to interview

17:15.201 --> 17:16.837
key witnesses to this crime.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.038
People present at the scene

17:18.070 --> 17:20.173
who have been instructed
by Ms. Frutt

17:20.205 --> 17:22.242
not to talk
to either police or--

17:22.275 --> 17:24.845
Ms. Gamble is now attempting
to try her case

17:24.877 --> 17:27.614
in the press and contaminate
a potential jury pool.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.015
GAMBLE: I am attempting
to cut through

17:29.049 --> 17:31.151
a cover-up orchestrated
by counsel.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.686
FRUTT: The District Attorney
anticipates

17:32.719 --> 17:35.121
not being able to mount
much of a prosecution,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.457
so she's trying
to establish the perception

17:37.490 --> 17:39.660
that it's our fault
she can't assemble evidence.

17:39.693 --> 17:43.396
Defense Counsel is again trying
to represent my thoughts--

17:43.429 --> 17:45.098
Your thoughts are transparent
enough for everyone.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.299
FINKEL: All right.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.335
Ms. Gamble, you will not be
using my courtroom

17:49.369 --> 17:50.604
to color public opinion.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.972
I'm not doing that, Your Honor.

17:53.874 --> 17:55.008
Who are the witnesses?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.843
Mrs. Ellison
and Allison Ellison,

17:56.877 --> 17:58.244
the defendant's daughter.

17:58.979 --> 18:00.681
FRUTT: Mrs. Ellison
certainly enjoys

18:00.714 --> 18:02.949
spousal privilege, Your Honor.
What about the daughter?

18:03.550 --> 18:05.051
We can't even get
in a room with her.

18:06.587 --> 18:09.389
Ms. Frutt, if I get
wind of tampering--

18:09.422 --> 18:11.057
I'm not doing that,
Your Honor.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.059
Is that right?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.028
Do these people
have separate counsel?

18:15.061 --> 18:16.963
I am the family attorney.

18:16.997 --> 18:20.000
FINKEL: Oh, you're
the family attorney.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.301
Did you tell the wife
and daughter

18:21.334 --> 18:23.504
they could face
accessory charges?

18:23.537 --> 18:26.439
Did you advise them it might
be in their best interest

18:26.472 --> 18:27.841
to cooperate with the police?

18:27.874 --> 18:30.844
Any and all communications
between me and my clients

18:30.877 --> 18:32.579
is, of course,
privileged, Your Honor.

18:34.515 --> 18:37.584
Mrs. Ellison and Allison,

18:37.618 --> 18:39.620
I strongly advise both of you

18:39.653 --> 18:41.187
get your own lawyers here.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.657
I won't order it for now,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.659
but Ms. Frutt may want
to silence you

18:45.692 --> 18:46.860
for the defendant's sake,

18:46.893 --> 18:49.229
and it may not be
what's best for you.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.197
In the meantime, Ms. Frutt,

18:51.231 --> 18:54.601
I am ordering that you make
Allison available

18:54.635 --> 18:57.571
to the District Attorney
for an interview.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.640
If she refuses to talk,

18:59.673 --> 19:02.108
she can be subpoenaed
to a grand jury.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.944
That's all for now.
We're adjourned.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.812
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
with the court's permission,

19:05.846 --> 19:07.748
I'd like security
to escort Allison

19:07.781 --> 19:09.015
to my office immediately.

19:09.049 --> 19:09.916
Why?

19:09.950 --> 19:12.185
I have concerns
that counsel might seek

19:12.218 --> 19:13.019
to prepare her statement.

19:13.053 --> 19:14.655
I object to that.

19:14.688 --> 19:16.289
GAMBLE: I would submit,
if there are no plans

19:16.322 --> 19:18.625
to conference with Ms. Ellison,
what's the harm?

19:18.659 --> 19:20.727
Ms. Ellison is also a client,

19:20.761 --> 19:22.663
and since criminal charges
may possibly

19:22.696 --> 19:25.198
be levied against her,
I have the right to advise.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.367
Security will escort
Ms. Ellison

19:27.400 --> 19:29.770
to Ms. Gamble's office.

19:29.803 --> 19:32.238
Defense Counsel,
but not the defendant,

19:32.272 --> 19:34.440
may be present at the interview.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.842
We're adjourned.

19:35.876 --> 19:36.543
(gavel bangs)

19:38.311 --> 19:40.146
Do you have any idea
what she's going to say?

19:52.659 --> 19:54.394
Don't let the media
get anywhere near him.

20:01.835 --> 20:04.004
YOUNG: Jimmy, you take
the neighborhood,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.839
see if anybody heard
or saw anything.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.975
I'll interview the employees
at Mrs. Ellison's job.

20:09.009 --> 20:11.411
Lucy, you stay on top
of the incident reports.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.614
Lindsay, you're in charge
of Jury Consultants.

20:13.647 --> 20:14.615
Hire them today.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.350
Bec, I need you to research
temporary insanity,

20:17.383 --> 20:18.284
heat of passion--
Research?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.420
Why do I always get research?
Rebecca--

20:20.453 --> 20:21.487
WASHINGTON: You always put
me on research.

20:21.522 --> 20:22.923
Why can't I ever do
fieldwork?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.457
Because Jimmy
and I are better at it.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.360
Sorry if that answer
disappoints you.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.329
DOLE: Are we sticking
everybody on this one case?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.064
YOUNG: Yes, we are, Lindsay,
because like it or not,

20:31.097 --> 20:33.099
we will be defined
by this one case.

20:33.133 --> 20:34.935
We will be the firm
that either won it

20:34.968 --> 20:36.102
or didn't win it.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.304
It would be nice to be
the firm that won it.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.106
Everybody's got a role.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.207
Let's go.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.150
ALLISON: We had just come
home from the movies.

20:50.183 --> 20:52.619
Our movie was sold out,
actually,

20:52.653 --> 20:54.220
so we had come home early.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.989
You and your dad?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.390
ALLISON: Yes.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.725
Then what did you do?

20:58.759 --> 21:01.161
I just went to my room.

21:02.796 --> 21:04.965
I think I might have gone
to the bathroom first.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.232
And then...

21:06.266 --> 21:08.134
I was getting ready
to call a friend,

21:09.670 --> 21:11.605
and then I heard
some screaming and yelling.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.940
Did you recognize
the voices?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.547
Did you recognize
the voices, Allison?

21:21.615 --> 21:23.449
No.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.585
GAMBLE: Okay.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.286
Then what happened?

21:28.221 --> 21:29.523
After a few seconds,

21:29.556 --> 21:32.492
I heard a loud
popping sound

21:33.459 --> 21:34.895
and more screaming.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.867
I ran down the hall
into my parents' bedroom.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.205
My mother and father
were screaming about something.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.407
My mother was crying.

21:48.274 --> 21:49.876
They just--they just kept on

21:49.910 --> 21:51.111
screaming at each other.

21:52.212 --> 21:53.547
And then I looked over

21:55.782 --> 21:57.584
and saw there was a man
in their bed.

21:58.552 --> 22:00.253
He wasn't moving,

22:00.286 --> 22:01.387
and he was bleeding.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.891
And his eyes were opened.

22:07.027 --> 22:08.562
GAMBLE: Did you hear
what your mother and father

22:08.595 --> 22:10.063
were screaming about?

22:11.532 --> 22:13.299
No.
GAMBLE: Did you see blood

22:13.333 --> 22:14.901
on your father's clothes?

22:16.236 --> 22:17.303
I don't remember.

22:18.739 --> 22:21.642
GAMBLE: Did you notice
if there was a gun around?

22:23.644 --> 22:25.045
I didn't see any gun.

22:26.947 --> 22:29.516
LOWE: Allison,
what do you think happened?

22:29.550 --> 22:30.551
I don't know.

22:30.584 --> 22:31.918
If you had to guess.

22:31.952 --> 22:33.319
She doesn't have
to make guesses.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.955
You were allowed to be
present for this interview.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.557
You are not permitted to either
conduct her or to inhibit--

22:36.590 --> 22:39.125
I will advise my client
to tell what she knows

22:39.159 --> 22:40.594
and not to formulate
opinions.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.162
You want to go right back
in front of that judge?

22:42.195 --> 22:43.997
Fine.
Hold on.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.398
Why don't you just
ask your questions?

22:45.431 --> 22:47.601
Yes, that would be nice.

22:50.070 --> 22:52.338
Did you ever ask your parents
what happened?

22:52.372 --> 22:53.339
No.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.941
Did you know
what happened?

22:54.975 --> 22:56.943
No.
GAMBLE: You didn't know

22:56.977 --> 22:59.079
what had happened,
and you didn't ask?

22:59.112 --> 23:00.781
Correct.

23:04.618 --> 23:07.153
Allison, did you have any
discussions with your attorneys

23:07.187 --> 23:09.055
about what you might say here
at this meeting?

23:09.089 --> 23:10.557
DONNELL: Don't answer.

23:10.591 --> 23:12.092
Privilege--work product.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.093
Forget it.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.427
GAMBLE:
We're into tampering, Bobby.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.796
You think
you can make tampering?

23:15.829 --> 23:17.698
Try. But don't be
asking our client

23:17.731 --> 23:19.432
about conversations
she had with us.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.168
So you had a conversation
in preparation for this meeting?

23:22.202 --> 23:23.904
Don't answer.
LOWE: Whether or not

23:23.937 --> 23:25.271
the conversation was had
does not fall within privilege--

23:25.305 --> 23:28.074
I'm instructing my client
not to answer.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.344
ALLISON:
I've told you all I know.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.446
GAMBLE: You've told us
all you know, Allison?

23:33.479 --> 23:34.648
Yes.

23:36.016 --> 23:38.218
I heard a pop...

23:38.251 --> 23:39.485
and yelling.

23:41.221 --> 23:42.889
That's it.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.825
And you never asked
your parents

23:44.858 --> 23:45.892
what happened here?

23:46.927 --> 23:47.861
No.

23:49.963 --> 23:51.464
I didn't.

23:51.497 --> 23:54.434
(music playing)

24:02.208 --> 24:03.677
LOWE: We have no
new information

24:03.710 --> 24:05.411
to share with you
at this time.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.048
Has Senator Ellison made
any kind of statement?

24:08.081 --> 24:10.116
Senator Ellison
is currently refusing

24:10.150 --> 24:12.018
to speak with us
at the advice of his attorneys.

24:12.052 --> 24:12.853
REPORTER: Mr. Lowe,
one more question.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.020
Get that out of my face,
please.

24:14.054 --> 24:15.722
REPORTER:
What about Mrs. Ellison?

24:15.756 --> 24:18.559
Mrs. Ellison is also
refusing to cooperate,

24:18.592 --> 24:20.561
which we find frustrating.

24:20.594 --> 24:22.729
Certainly, it's every
defendant's right

24:22.763 --> 24:24.030
not to speak,

24:24.064 --> 24:26.466
and that right would inure
to the spouse as well,

24:26.499 --> 24:28.101
but we're particularly
disappointed

24:28.134 --> 24:29.469
when a State Senator,

24:29.503 --> 24:31.672
a person ostensibly
committed to justice,

24:31.705 --> 24:33.874
forsakes that commitment
out of self-interest.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.375
He can't say that.
DOLE: That's misconduct.

24:35.408 --> 24:36.577
Let's get it in
before Judge Finkel,

24:36.610 --> 24:37.578
shut them down.

24:37.611 --> 24:38.545
Whoa. Slow down.

24:38.579 --> 24:40.781
He cannot comment
on a defendant's silence.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.382
The state bar--
Ellenor.

24:42.415 --> 24:44.450
He's deliberately
contaminating the jury pool.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.086
YOUNG: Of course, he is,
but if we go to Judge Finkel,

24:46.119 --> 24:47.287
he might gag all of us.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.355
We do not want that.
Why not?

24:49.389 --> 24:51.124
If he's going to try
their case in the press--

24:51.157 --> 24:53.627
Because we need the press
more than they do.

24:55.128 --> 24:57.163
Now, we all know how it looks.

24:57.197 --> 24:58.899
We need to shape
public opinion here.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.266
If we get gagged--
WASHINGTON: Why aren't we

25:00.300 --> 25:01.902
at least putting out
some version--

25:01.935 --> 25:03.670
We don't need to.
The burden is on them.

25:03.704 --> 25:05.238
WASHINGTON:
Our people were there.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.307
The prosecution
can prove they were there.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.309
To me, that shifts
the burden to us.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.176
I agree.

25:10.210 --> 25:11.044
BERLUTI: I don't.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.614
We got three possible
suspects here,

25:13.647 --> 25:14.815
the Senator, his wife,

25:14.848 --> 25:16.349
or the daughter.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.218
The prosecution can't nail
any of them

25:18.251 --> 25:19.385
beyond a reasonable doubt.

25:19.419 --> 25:21.454
Oh, please,
he's convicted now.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.956
You're just mad
over doing research.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.825
Oh, that's funny.
All right.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.426
DOLE: We're up against
Helen Gamble here,

25:26.459 --> 25:27.794
and Alan Lowe.

25:27.828 --> 25:29.996
We've beaten Helen
many times, Lindsay.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.965
If they prove this affair,
that gives them motive.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.567
With motive,
his being at the scene,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.301
his gun, he's gone.

25:35.335 --> 25:36.670
We need to start
building a theory

25:36.703 --> 25:38.071
and put it out there.
The more we wait--

25:38.104 --> 25:40.807
Look, let's just see what
their evidence file shows.

25:40.841 --> 25:43.076
It's too soon for us
to commit to anything.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.878
Bobby, hello.
DONNELL: Public opinion

25:44.911 --> 25:46.813
can't send him to prison,
Lindsay.

25:46.847 --> 25:49.182
Are you sure for this one?

25:58.258 --> 25:59.192
(knocks on door)

26:01.427 --> 26:02.663
Is it good news?

26:02.696 --> 26:04.330
Sort of.

26:04.364 --> 26:05.999
Ballistics confirm
it was his gun.

26:06.032 --> 26:06.867
Prints?

26:06.900 --> 26:08.068
Wiped clean.

26:09.670 --> 26:11.004
Trace metal?
McGUIRE: Negative.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.839
There was a pair
of dishwashing gloves

26:12.873 --> 26:13.840
soaking in the sink.

26:13.874 --> 26:16.543
What about powder burns
or primer residues?

26:16.577 --> 26:18.278
No, but they could have
washed off if--

26:18.311 --> 26:20.013
Anything to prove
the affair.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.615
Not yet.

26:21.648 --> 26:22.916
No semen,

26:22.949 --> 26:24.384
nothing from
the cavity search.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.587
No blood on her,
but she showered, so--

26:26.620 --> 26:27.654
What about hairs
in the bed?

26:27.688 --> 26:29.590
Some, but they could be old.

26:31.191 --> 26:32.626
It's early, Helen.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.860
Give us time.

26:33.894 --> 26:35.428
Interview everybody
at her work.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.598
Somebody had to have seen
the two together.

26:38.699 --> 26:40.033
They'll never prove it.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.535
No one ever saw us.

26:41.568 --> 26:42.569
You can be sure of that?

26:42.603 --> 26:44.470
MARSHA:
He always left before me.

26:44.505 --> 26:46.873
He had his own set of keys
to my car.

26:46.907 --> 26:48.575
He'd get in, duck down.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.643
I'd come down,

26:49.676 --> 26:51.878
drive home
directly into my garage.

26:51.912 --> 26:54.180
No one ever saw him
go into my house.

26:54.214 --> 26:56.316
DONNELL: Suppose somebody
saw him get into your car.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.852
He always made sure
that never happened.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.855
Okay, look,

27:01.888 --> 27:03.423
ordinarily,
we would just sit back

27:03.456 --> 27:04.658
and do nothing here.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.560
We would leave the burden
to the prosecution

27:06.593 --> 27:07.828
to prove the crime.

27:07.861 --> 27:11.231
The problem,
this case is so high-profile

27:11.264 --> 27:12.699
that there is
an enormous danger

27:12.733 --> 27:14.334
of jury contamination.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.774
We want you to tell us
what happened.

27:22.543 --> 27:23.710
Isn't that dangerous?

27:23.744 --> 27:25.011
If it means you having
to get other lawyers--

27:25.045 --> 27:26.279
No.
Keith.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.048
No.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.215
I want your firm.

27:29.249 --> 27:30.917
DONNELL: Senator,
the likelihood is that

27:30.951 --> 27:32.986
they will be able to prove
your wife's affair

27:33.019 --> 27:34.487
with the victim.

27:34.521 --> 27:35.589
With that,

27:35.622 --> 27:37.691
with your gun
being the murder weapon,

27:37.724 --> 27:38.925
with you being at the scene,

27:38.959 --> 27:41.261
with your clothes
being in the washer.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.065
You'll be convicted,
Senator.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.834
If you tell us what happened,

27:47.868 --> 27:50.370
you might give us
something to go with.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.008
FRUTT: Keith,

27:55.041 --> 27:58.078
you said you were putting
yourself in my hands.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.946
As your lawyer,

27:59.980 --> 28:01.081
as your friend,

28:01.114 --> 28:04.250
I am advising you
to tell us what happened.

28:08.789 --> 28:10.356
The movie...

28:10.390 --> 28:12.192
was sold out,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.696
so Allison and I

28:15.729 --> 28:17.798
came home early.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.065
Allison, I guess,

28:20.466 --> 28:23.570
went off to her room,
and I went upstairs.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.307
And I--

28:27.340 --> 28:29.309
I heard sounds

28:29.342 --> 28:31.444
coming from our bedroom.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.913
I heard a male voice,

28:34.280 --> 28:35.415
and I thought--

28:38.418 --> 28:39.452
I thought--

28:41.555 --> 28:43.456
I could only think
that maybe

28:43.489 --> 28:45.491
Marsha was being raped

28:45.526 --> 28:47.894
or attacked.

28:47.928 --> 28:50.697
And I got my revolver

28:50.731 --> 28:52.398
from the safe in the back
of the linen cupboard,

28:52.432 --> 28:54.467
and I went to the bedroom,

28:54.500 --> 28:55.669
and I--

28:57.170 --> 28:59.305
I saw this...

28:59.339 --> 29:01.842
stranger on her,

29:01.875 --> 29:04.545
and I just--
I squeezed the trigger.

29:04.578 --> 29:05.846
(gunshot)

29:05.879 --> 29:08.214
KEITH: And suddenly,
Marsha was screaming.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.116
There was blood
everywhere.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.753
It all happened so fast,

29:12.786 --> 29:14.320
and I--

29:14.354 --> 29:18.091
I saw this man,
and I shot him.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.492
I--

29:23.129 --> 29:24.464
I didn't realize

29:25.866 --> 29:28.268
until after

29:28.301 --> 29:30.036
what--what was--

29:33.974 --> 29:36.009
what had--

29:36.042 --> 29:37.844
what had really
been going on.

29:41.582 --> 29:43.650
The problem with that--

29:43.684 --> 29:46.019
the gun was wiped
clean of prints,

29:46.052 --> 29:48.522
your clothes
were in the washer,

29:48.555 --> 29:49.756
and the question will be

29:49.790 --> 29:52.025
if you thought
you were justified,

29:52.058 --> 29:55.395
why did you try
to cover your tracks?

29:57.330 --> 29:58.565
MARSHA: I did that.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.002
It was stupid,
I suppose, but...

30:04.304 --> 30:07.440
he has worked
his entire adult life

30:07.473 --> 30:11.444
building his public career,

30:11.477 --> 30:13.680
and I didn't want to see it
all go away

30:13.714 --> 30:15.081
because of something...

30:16.482 --> 30:17.851
that I caused.

30:19.085 --> 30:20.320
DONNELL: I assume
you will testify that

30:20.353 --> 30:21.555
from your vantage point.

30:21.588 --> 30:23.824
It appeared he was acting
in defense of you.

30:23.857 --> 30:25.325
Of course.

30:27.861 --> 30:29.329
DONNELL: Well, then
that's how we proceed.

30:29.362 --> 30:33.199
We argue mistaken defense
of others.

30:33.233 --> 30:36.036
It's a form of self-defense.

30:36.069 --> 30:38.038
I'd like to make
a public statement.

30:38.071 --> 30:38.839
I don't recommend that.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.440
You said yourself

30:40.473 --> 30:42.208
that they were trying us
in the press.

30:42.242 --> 30:44.578
Anything you say
could be used to impeach you.

30:44.611 --> 30:45.912
I'll keep it short.

30:45.946 --> 30:48.515
It's a bad idea.

30:48.549 --> 30:49.783
It's a great idea.

30:49.816 --> 30:51.685
I mean, you can certainly go
over what he plans to say.

30:51.718 --> 30:53.153
DONNELL: What if he ad-libs
the wrong thing?

30:53.186 --> 30:54.588
YOUNG: You make sure
he doesn't.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.990
Bobby, his going
before the cameras--

30:57.023 --> 30:58.725
it goes to the same
jury pool

30:58.759 --> 31:01.094
the prosecution is trying
to influence right now,

31:01.127 --> 31:02.128
and if he talks,

31:02.162 --> 31:03.296
more cameras
will be rolling.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.566
Why aren't we going
for a change of venue?

31:05.599 --> 31:07.668
If you ask me--
We want this venue, Rebecca.

31:07.701 --> 31:08.735
He's a celebrity here,

31:08.769 --> 31:09.970
a popular one.

31:10.003 --> 31:12.205
Well, if he goes forward
with a statement now,

31:12.238 --> 31:13.439
you're married
to self-defense.

31:13.473 --> 31:14.941
You can't then go
on the elements--

31:14.975 --> 31:16.242
YOUNG: Does anybody here
really believe

31:16.276 --> 31:17.644
we've got a shot
on the elements?

31:17.678 --> 31:19.580
I mean, his house, his gun,

31:19.613 --> 31:20.747
he's at the scene,

31:20.781 --> 31:22.448
and they can probably
prove the affair.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.321
Self-defense
is our best hope,

31:28.354 --> 31:30.691
and best we start
working the jury now.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.392
I'm with Eugene.

31:32.425 --> 31:33.660
Let the man talk.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.305
(music playing)

31:59.285 --> 32:01.354
GAMBLE: So far, it's like
the immaculate affair,

32:01.387 --> 32:03.790
although we do have
one witness willing to say

32:03.824 --> 32:05.759
she saw something going on
at a party.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.928
It's nothing I'd call
concrete, but--

32:07.961 --> 32:10.196
Nobody saw them go
into a motel or--

32:10.230 --> 32:11.431
GAMBLE: Kenny,
this woman's prepping to be

32:11.464 --> 32:13.099
the first lady
of Massachusetts.

32:13.133 --> 32:14.234
She was careful.

32:15.368 --> 32:16.402
You know about this
press conference?

32:16.436 --> 32:17.470
GAMBLE: Excuse me?

32:17.504 --> 32:18.705
He's called for
a press conference.

32:18.739 --> 32:20.541
He's going on.
GAMBLE: Who?

32:23.176 --> 32:24.911
KEITH: I should first note

32:24.945 --> 32:27.280
I appear before you today

32:27.313 --> 32:29.215
against the advice
of my counsel,

32:29.249 --> 32:31.718
who you see behind me.

32:31.752 --> 32:33.620
For purposes
of a criminal trial,

32:33.654 --> 32:35.221
it's best
to remain silent.

32:35.255 --> 32:36.823
A fact I know you are

32:36.857 --> 32:37.958
acutely aware of.

32:39.059 --> 32:40.861
But being
in public office,

32:40.894 --> 32:43.096
I enjoy a public trust,

32:43.129 --> 32:45.231
and that trust
cannot faithfully

32:45.265 --> 32:47.300
be served or honored

32:47.333 --> 32:50.270
by my continued silence.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.873
Thus, I feel it is my duty
to come forward

32:52.906 --> 32:55.942
because the public
has a right to know.

32:57.844 --> 33:00.914
On Saturday, July 12th,

33:00.947 --> 33:03.316
I left in the early evening
to go see a movie

33:03.349 --> 33:04.885
with my daughter Allison.

33:05.786 --> 33:07.387
The film being sold out,

33:07.420 --> 33:08.822
we returned early.

33:08.855 --> 33:10.957
You believe this?
Shh.

33:10.991 --> 33:12.192
KEITH:
When I heard the sounds,

33:12.225 --> 33:16.730
it sounded like
a physical attack.

33:16.763 --> 33:19.733
It even sounded like
somebody was being strangled.

33:20.867 --> 33:22.569
I retrieved my revolver,

33:22.603 --> 33:23.837
which I kept in the house

33:23.870 --> 33:26.006
for personal protection,

33:26.039 --> 33:28.575
and I ran to the room
in fear,

33:28.609 --> 33:31.077
desperate fear

33:31.111 --> 33:32.478
that my wife Marsha

33:32.513 --> 33:35.181
was either being raped,

33:35.215 --> 33:37.350
or worse, murdered.

33:38.619 --> 33:39.853
When I entered the room,

33:39.886 --> 33:42.889
I saw what appeared
to be a struggle

33:42.923 --> 33:45.391
with a strange man
on top of my wife.

33:46.627 --> 33:48.629
I thought she was
being killed.

33:49.730 --> 33:51.598
As he rolled to face me,

33:51.632 --> 33:54.668
I discharged my revolver.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.036
The bullet hit him,

33:57.738 --> 33:59.205
and he fell silent.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.243
It was only
in the following seconds

34:03.276 --> 34:04.578
that I came to realize

34:04.611 --> 34:06.412
what was actually...

34:10.315 --> 34:11.417
going on.

34:13.286 --> 34:14.888
My wife was not,

34:14.920 --> 34:17.623
in fact, under attack.

34:17.658 --> 34:18.792
The passion

34:18.824 --> 34:20.393
I mistook for rage,

34:20.426 --> 34:21.594
for a deadly threat,

34:21.628 --> 34:23.797
was a different
kind of passion,

34:23.830 --> 34:26.833
a passion a husband
never wants to think his wife--

34:29.770 --> 34:32.938
I shot a man
who was committing adultery,

34:34.507 --> 34:36.743
not a man
who was trying to kill.

34:39.045 --> 34:41.915
I didn't realize this until...

34:41.947 --> 34:43.850
it was obviously too late.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.487
Though I will have to live

34:47.521 --> 34:50.524
with the fact that I took
another human life.

34:52.492 --> 34:54.761
It is something
I will never get over.

34:56.196 --> 34:59.199
In my mind,
I saw a potentially

34:59.232 --> 35:02.969
deadly threat of violence agai--

35:05.371 --> 35:06.773
against my wife.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.578
I accept responsibility.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.316
I ask for no one's
forgiveness,

35:17.884 --> 35:19.586
only your understanding.

35:22.255 --> 35:23.189
Thank you.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.762
LOWE: The fact that
Senator Ellison

35:28.795 --> 35:30.731
would refuse
to talk to the police,

35:30.764 --> 35:33.133
would refuse to cooperate
with our investigation,

35:33.166 --> 35:34.968
only to go before the cameras

35:35.001 --> 35:37.904
with a self-serving ramble
overtly designed

35:37.938 --> 35:39.640
to poison the objectivity
of the people

35:39.673 --> 35:41.141
he was elected to represent,

35:41.174 --> 35:44.711
I found that to be
inconceivable.

35:44.745 --> 35:46.580
I found it
personally disgusting.

35:46.613 --> 35:49.249
Did you know he'd be
claiming self-defense?

35:49.282 --> 35:50.917
You know, we expected
something desperate,

35:50.951 --> 35:52.986
and that is exactly
what this is.

35:53.019 --> 35:54.220
It's an anemic Hail Mary

35:54.254 --> 35:55.989
from a guilty murderer.

35:56.022 --> 35:58.058
Why was the gun

35:58.091 --> 35:59.860
wiped clean
of fingerprints?

35:59.893 --> 36:03.096
Why were his clothes
thrown in a washer?

36:03.129 --> 36:04.430
Was this obstruction
of justice

36:04.464 --> 36:07.601
in service
to his public trust?

36:07.634 --> 36:10.070
Who exactly did he honor

36:10.103 --> 36:12.138
by trying to cover
all of this up?

36:13.940 --> 36:15.208
Well, let me tell you this.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.111
As a district attorney,

36:18.144 --> 36:21.314
I have a duty to the
public trust, as well,

36:21.347 --> 36:22.415
and that's to see that

36:22.448 --> 36:24.417
when people kill
human beings,

36:24.450 --> 36:25.619
they go to prison.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.222
There's no exceptions
for politicians,

36:29.255 --> 36:31.892
no excuses
for wronged husbands,

36:31.925 --> 36:33.627
no favors...

36:33.660 --> 36:35.562
for eloquent speakers.

36:36.930 --> 36:38.732
You kill,

36:38.765 --> 36:40.133
you go to jail.

36:41.334 --> 36:43.837
And that is what
will happen here.

36:49.776 --> 36:51.211
LEVY: It was mainly a feeling--

36:51.244 --> 36:54.214
never heard or saw
any actual proof.

36:54.247 --> 36:55.649
BERLUTI:
And the feeling was?

36:55.682 --> 36:57.483
They were involved.

36:57.518 --> 36:59.319
They would shoot each other
looks sometimes,

36:59.352 --> 37:00.687
flirty behavior.

37:00.721 --> 37:03.524
I just assumed something
was going on between them.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.792
How well did you know
Mrs. Ellison?

37:05.826 --> 37:07.427
Not well.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.630
We worked in the same office,
obviously,

37:09.663 --> 37:11.932
but I had very little
direct interaction.

37:11.965 --> 37:14.200
And the victim,
Mr. McNoun?

37:15.501 --> 37:16.770
He was my boss.

37:19.973 --> 37:21.141
And this party,

37:21.174 --> 37:23.276
Mrs. Ellison came
with Mr. McNoun?

37:23.309 --> 37:24.277
Oh, God, no.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.679
She came with her husband,

37:25.712 --> 37:28.181
but I saw them
in an office together.

37:28.214 --> 37:30.784
Mr. McNoun,
and Mrs. Ellison?

37:32.052 --> 37:35.155
And it looked like something
was going on between them.

37:35.188 --> 37:36.489
I just knew it.

37:39.993 --> 37:41.795
GAMBLE: So what?
It's not enough

37:41.828 --> 37:43.263
that we establish
the affair now.

37:43.296 --> 37:45.532
We have to show
he knew about it.

37:45.566 --> 37:47.333
If we can prove
he knew what was going on,

37:47.367 --> 37:49.870
there's no way
they'll sell self-defense.

37:49.903 --> 37:51.705
Husbands know.
They always know.

37:51.738 --> 37:53.306
Well, we haven't been able
to find any--

37:53.339 --> 37:54.708
Then get back out there, Mike.

37:54.741 --> 37:56.176
Dig harder.

37:56.209 --> 37:56.943
All right,
all right, Helen.

37:56.977 --> 38:00.547
Mike, this is a big piece.

38:00.581 --> 38:02.448
If we can show that
he was even suspicious

38:02.482 --> 38:03.917
that his wife
was sleeping around,

38:03.950 --> 38:06.219
we'll be able to argue
that he knew what was going on

38:06.252 --> 38:07.721
when he went for the gun.

38:07.754 --> 38:09.255
GAMBLE: Oh, well,
look, we're dead.

38:09.289 --> 38:10.857
You all do know that.

38:10.891 --> 38:12.125
The guy is sympathetic.

38:12.158 --> 38:13.293
He's--he's charming.

38:13.326 --> 38:14.728
He's credible,

38:14.761 --> 38:16.863
and we're dead.
No, we're not.

38:16.897 --> 38:18.832
The guy caught a man
screwing his wife.

38:18.865 --> 38:20.400
He blows the guy's
head off,

38:20.433 --> 38:22.068
and then he says,
"Oops!

38:22.102 --> 38:23.837
I thought he was trying
to kill her."

38:25.405 --> 38:26.773
We'll get him.
GAMBLE: We've got nothing

38:26.807 --> 38:28.141
on state of mind, Alan.

38:28.174 --> 38:29.543
It's us against his word,

38:29.576 --> 38:31.177
and you saw
how well he plays.

38:31.211 --> 38:34.380
(telephone rings)

38:34.414 --> 38:35.749
GAMBLE: Helen Gamble.

38:37.183 --> 38:38.418
Okay.

38:42.088 --> 38:44.658
Judge wants to see us.

38:44.691 --> 38:47.127
FINKEL: Should we bother
to have a trial here, people,

38:47.160 --> 38:48.962
or just put it
to a referendum

38:48.995 --> 38:50.363
on the November ballot?

38:50.396 --> 38:52.799
I would gag you all
right now

38:52.833 --> 38:54.300
if I didn't think
you'd both

38:54.334 --> 38:56.937
immediately start
with confidential sourcing.

38:58.071 --> 39:00.240
Ms. Frutt,
you let your client

39:00.273 --> 39:01.341
hold press conferences,

39:01.374 --> 39:02.843
you will have a hard time

39:02.876 --> 39:05.912
disqualifying jurors
for knowing too much.

39:05.946 --> 39:07.748
Ms. Gamble,

39:07.781 --> 39:09.950
attempt to prejudice
the trial,

39:09.983 --> 39:12.152
you will find your juror
challenges gone.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.620
I will prohibit you

39:13.654 --> 39:15.922
right now
from making any comments

39:15.956 --> 39:18.625
concerning the evidence
of this case.

39:18.659 --> 39:21.494
That goes for every one of you.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.930
Now, common sense tells me

39:23.964 --> 39:25.966
this goes away
for manslaughter--

39:25.999 --> 39:27.634
six years, three suspended.

39:27.668 --> 39:29.235
That seems a little light.

39:29.269 --> 39:30.837
You'd jump at it.
Don't kid yourself,

39:30.871 --> 39:32.506
and so should you.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.641
The idea he thought
she was being killed

39:34.675 --> 39:37.043
smells like crap.

39:37.077 --> 39:38.612
This was a heat
of passion murder.

39:38.645 --> 39:42.015
Let's dispose of it
for what it is.

39:50.056 --> 39:51.257
Are you recommending it?

39:51.291 --> 39:52.292
FRUTT: With good behavior,

39:52.325 --> 39:54.094
you could get out
in 18 months.

39:54.127 --> 39:56.997
Isn't that a bargain
for human life-taking?

40:03.236 --> 40:04.538
Can I win this?

40:05.772 --> 40:06.907
You could,

40:06.940 --> 40:08.709
but it's a risk, Keith,

40:08.742 --> 40:09.710
and if we lose,

40:09.743 --> 40:11.377
you are looking
at murder two,

40:11.411 --> 40:13.413
which carries
a statutory

40:13.446 --> 40:15.181
life sentence.

40:16.517 --> 40:19.119
I just told the public
it was self-defense.

40:19.152 --> 40:21.555
If I plead on manslaughter,
how would that look?

40:21.588 --> 40:23.489
I think the public is
sophisticated enough to know--

40:23.524 --> 40:25.225
And they believe me,
by the way.

40:25.258 --> 40:27.528
Have you heard
the HDH poll?

40:27.561 --> 40:28.629
My approval ratings

40:28.662 --> 40:30.330
are higher than before
the shooting.

40:30.363 --> 40:32.498
Well, then it was
all worth it.

40:35.001 --> 40:36.837
Do we have a problem?

40:36.870 --> 40:37.904
Do we have a problem?

40:37.938 --> 40:39.472
Ellenor,
I was having an affair.

40:39.506 --> 40:40.874
I was...

40:40.907 --> 40:42.809
fond of this person,

40:42.843 --> 40:44.177
and Keith shot him.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.948
Clearly, these are not
the best of times.

40:56.690 --> 40:57.958
I don't want to plead.

40:57.991 --> 41:00.460
FRUTT: You can't be
looking at this

41:00.493 --> 41:02.428
with respect
to your political career.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.197
This is about
your life, Keith,

41:04.230 --> 41:05.131
your freedom.

41:05.165 --> 41:06.567
My life is

41:06.600 --> 41:08.234
my political career, Ellenor.

41:08.268 --> 41:10.470
You know that, and it's over

41:10.504 --> 41:12.939
if I accept
a homicide conviction.

41:12.973 --> 41:14.741
FRUTT:
As convincing as you are,

41:14.775 --> 41:16.209
to get a jury to believe

41:16.242 --> 41:18.745
that you ran in there
shooting in self-defense?

41:18.779 --> 41:20.714
You don't believe it?

41:21.481 --> 41:22.983
I do,

41:23.016 --> 41:24.618
but I know you.

41:24.651 --> 41:27.020
The 12 people
in that box?

41:27.053 --> 41:28.822
Are you telling me

41:28.855 --> 41:30.290
we cannot win this trial?

41:30.323 --> 41:31.858
I am not telling you that.

41:31.892 --> 41:33.193
KEITH: And isn't it possible

41:33.226 --> 41:34.728
the manslaughter deal

41:34.761 --> 41:37.130
could still be available
during trail?

41:37.163 --> 41:38.398
That is certainly
possible, but--

41:38.431 --> 41:40.466
Then I want to try.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.402
Let's see how
the trial goes, then--

41:42.435 --> 41:44.437
DONNELL: If the prosecution's
case goes well,

41:44.470 --> 41:46.472
this deal
will be off the table.

41:51.211 --> 41:53.013
Eighteen months, Keith.

41:54.815 --> 41:55.982
You killed a man.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.985
It was mistaken
self-defense.

41:59.019 --> 42:02.022
The prosecution knows
they can't disprove that.

42:02.055 --> 42:03.156
That's why the manslaughter

42:03.189 --> 42:04.157
is being offered.

42:05.792 --> 42:07.528
We go to trial.

42:07.561 --> 42:09.362
You understand the risk?

42:09.395 --> 42:10.296
I do.

42:11.965 --> 42:13.466
Let's go to trial.

42:23.644 --> 42:25.311
ANCHOR (over TV): If you didn't
get your courtroom pass

42:25.345 --> 42:27.413
three weeks ago,
and without media credentials,

42:27.447 --> 42:29.683
you'd have to know somebody
to get one,

42:29.716 --> 42:31.752
you won't be sitting
in division three

42:31.785 --> 42:33.186
in the Suffolk
Superior Courthouse,

42:33.219 --> 42:35.055
not today or any day

42:35.088 --> 42:36.356
in the near future.

42:36.389 --> 42:38.592
It's not just
because it's a murder trial

42:38.625 --> 42:40.393
or that it involves
a State Senator

42:40.426 --> 42:41.528
or even that two

42:41.562 --> 42:42.963
of the opposing lawyers

42:42.996 --> 42:44.931
are roommates.

42:44.965 --> 42:46.833
It's because
of that burning question

42:46.867 --> 42:48.702
this trial will attempt
to answer,

42:48.735 --> 42:51.037
the question
that this entire city has,

42:51.071 --> 42:52.172
for two months now,

42:52.205 --> 42:54.307
been asking
on every street corner,

42:54.340 --> 42:55.308
in every bar room,

42:55.341 --> 42:56.910
at every dinner table,

42:56.943 --> 42:59.345
what was Senator Ellison
really thinking

42:59.379 --> 43:01.214
when he fired that gun?

43:01.247 --> 43:03.850
Did he believe
his wife's life was in danger

43:03.884 --> 43:06.486
or was the shooting
an act of vengeance?

43:06.520 --> 43:09.155
The prosecution has vowed
to put in a short case,

43:09.189 --> 43:11.592
the facts not really
being in dispute.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.760
Every legal analyst agrees

43:13.794 --> 43:16.963
the trial will come down
to Senator Ellison's testimony

43:16.997 --> 43:19.265
and the cross-examination
by Helen Gamble,

43:19.299 --> 43:21.535
which figures
to be extremely tough.

43:21.568 --> 43:24.505
(music playing)

43:27.741 --> 43:29.275
Let's go.

43:29.309 --> 43:32.245
(music playing)

43:41.855 --> 43:43.389
(indistinct chatter)

43:43.423 --> 43:44.758
(elevator dings)

43:44.791 --> 43:45.726
REPORTER: Senator?

43:45.759 --> 43:47.260
Does the Senator
have a comment?--

43:47.293 --> 43:50.230
(reporters shouting questions)

43:51.565 --> 43:52.899
REPORTER: Senator--

43:55.068 --> 43:56.336
Ms. Gamble, Mr. Lowe...

43:56.369 --> 43:59.305
(indistinct chatter)

44:35.709 --> 44:37.744
This trial is not
about who shot

44:37.778 --> 44:40.380
and killed James McNoun.

44:40.413 --> 44:41.948
The defendant did that.

44:41.982 --> 44:44.217
There's no dispute there.

44:44.250 --> 44:47.353
This trial
is about why he did it.

44:47.387 --> 44:50.691
Now, the evidence
will show conclusively

44:50.724 --> 44:52.726
that the defendant
discovered his wife

44:52.759 --> 44:54.160
making love to the victim

44:54.194 --> 44:55.962
and in an act of anger

44:55.996 --> 44:57.130
and revenge,

44:57.163 --> 44:58.665
murdered Mr. McNoun.

44:59.633 --> 45:01.067
The evidence will show

45:01.101 --> 45:03.937
the defendant then sought
to cover up his crime,

45:03.970 --> 45:05.806
that he either destroyed

45:05.839 --> 45:07.040
or tampered with evidence

45:07.073 --> 45:09.109
in an attempt to get away

45:09.142 --> 45:10.210
with this murder.

45:11.344 --> 45:13.446
There's an old saying
in the medical profession,

45:14.748 --> 45:16.517
"When you hear hoof beats,

45:16.550 --> 45:18.685
don't think zebra."

45:18.719 --> 45:20.587
Now, this means
instead of looking

45:20.621 --> 45:22.255
for some exotic,

45:22.288 --> 45:23.690
far-fetched diagnosis,

45:23.724 --> 45:26.059
just see the obvious.

45:26.092 --> 45:28.494
In this trial,
ladies and gentlemen,

45:28.529 --> 45:30.664
the Commonwealth
will only be asking you

45:30.697 --> 45:32.699
to see the obvious.

45:33.767 --> 45:35.636
The defendant murdered the man

45:35.669 --> 45:37.237
sleeping with his wife.

45:51.017 --> 45:53.153
I agree
with the district attorney.

45:53.186 --> 45:54.988
This trial is simply

45:55.021 --> 45:57.824
about why Senator Ellison

45:57.858 --> 46:00.126
fatally wounded the stranger
in his house.

46:01.194 --> 46:03.864
To answer that question,

46:03.897 --> 46:05.566
you'll need to get
into the head

46:05.599 --> 46:07.834
of Senator Ellison.

46:07.868 --> 46:09.502
You'll need to imagine

46:09.536 --> 46:11.505
coming home late at night

46:11.538 --> 46:13.707
and hearing the sounds
of a struggle

46:13.740 --> 46:15.909
coming from your bedroom.

46:15.942 --> 46:18.478
You will need
to fathom the panic,

46:18.512 --> 46:20.013
knowing your spouse

46:20.046 --> 46:22.182
was home alone this night.

46:22.215 --> 46:24.751
You will have
to appreciate the fear

46:24.785 --> 46:26.452
that can suddenly consume you

46:26.486 --> 46:27.988
at the thought--

46:28.021 --> 46:30.857
the thought
that the person you love

46:30.891 --> 46:32.392
is being raped

46:32.425 --> 46:33.727
or possibly killed

46:33.760 --> 46:35.796
in the next room.

46:35.829 --> 46:38.031
Can any of us truly presume

46:38.064 --> 46:40.500
to know what
that must be like?

46:40.534 --> 46:42.402
Have any of us ever
had to listen

46:42.435 --> 46:44.237
to the sounds of a husband

46:44.270 --> 46:45.839
or wife being attacked

46:45.872 --> 46:48.008
by an intruder?

46:48.041 --> 46:50.243
The evidence will show

46:50.276 --> 46:51.678
what happened that night

46:51.712 --> 46:54.080
is that Senator Ellison
went racing

46:54.114 --> 46:55.248
into that room

46:55.281 --> 46:57.918
to protect the woman he loved,

46:57.951 --> 47:00.253
the mother of his daughter,

47:00.286 --> 47:01.555
Allison.

47:01.588 --> 47:03.289
He charged in there
with a gun

47:03.323 --> 47:04.991
in a state of panic,

47:05.025 --> 47:06.793
fear, horror

47:06.827 --> 47:08.028
to see an intruder

47:08.061 --> 47:09.429
on top of his wife,

47:09.462 --> 47:11.064
and he fired.

47:13.266 --> 47:14.300
Turns out,

47:16.036 --> 47:17.904
he got it wrong.

47:17.938 --> 47:22.909
It was mistaken self-defense.

47:22.943 --> 47:24.410
That will be the evidence

47:24.444 --> 47:27.113
because it's the truth,

47:27.147 --> 47:29.415
and as you listen
to the facts,

47:29.449 --> 47:30.651
the testimony,

47:30.684 --> 47:31.918
the witnesses,

47:31.952 --> 47:35.856
remember, the prosecution's
entire case,

47:35.889 --> 47:36.523
all of it,

47:36.557 --> 47:39.159
the reason we are even here,

47:40.694 --> 47:41.828
is their presumption

47:41.862 --> 47:43.864
they know what was going on

47:43.897 --> 47:46.032
in Senator Ellison's mind.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.502
Of course,
that's impossible,

47:49.536 --> 47:51.371
impossible for them to know,

47:52.739 --> 47:55.909
impossible for you to know.

47:55.942 --> 47:57.744
All the Commonwealth
can really do

47:57.778 --> 48:00.413
is ask you to imagine.

48:03.116 --> 48:04.017
And we will be making

48:04.050 --> 48:07.253
that very same request.

48:09.590 --> 48:10.791
Imagine.

48:25.806 --> 48:27.708
McGUIRE: That's how he looked
when we got there.

48:27.741 --> 48:29.309
LOWE: Who else was there
when you arrived, detective?

48:29.342 --> 48:31.745
McGUIRE: The defendant,
Mrs. Ellison,

48:31.778 --> 48:32.646
the daughter, Allison,

48:32.679 --> 48:34.781
and the defendant's
attorney, Ms. Frutt.

48:34.815 --> 48:36.382
LOWE: The attorney was there
before the police?

48:36.416 --> 48:37.417
That's correct.

48:37.450 --> 48:38.985
Who called the police?

48:39.019 --> 48:40.120
McGUIRE: Ms. Frutt.

48:40.153 --> 48:42.155
LOWE: Was there ever
a 911 call placed

48:42.188 --> 48:43.323
from the residence?

48:43.356 --> 48:44.558
McGUIRE: No, there was not.

48:44.591 --> 48:45.992
LOWE: After you finally
got there,

48:46.026 --> 48:47.694
at some point you decided

48:47.728 --> 48:48.629
to place the defendant

48:48.662 --> 48:50.363
under arrest for murder.

48:50.396 --> 48:51.497
Yes.
Why?

48:51.532 --> 48:53.233
McGUIRE: There was a single
gunshot wound to the head

48:53.266 --> 48:54.535
from a fairly close range,

48:54.568 --> 48:56.803
resembling an execution-style--
Objection.

48:56.837 --> 48:58.138
Sustained.

48:58.171 --> 49:00.006
McGUIRE: The gun was found
on the scene.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.542
It belonged
to the defendant.

49:01.575 --> 49:03.076
Did you check it
for fingerprints?

49:03.109 --> 49:05.411
It had been wiped clean
of any fingerprints.

49:05.445 --> 49:07.080
LOWE: Did you subsequently
do any tests

49:07.113 --> 49:08.582
on the defendant to determine

49:08.615 --> 49:10.684
if he had held the gun?
Yes.

49:10.717 --> 49:12.553
We did what is known
as a trace metal test,

49:12.586 --> 49:14.555
which basically indicates
whether or not a person

49:14.588 --> 49:16.089
has recently held a firearm.

49:16.122 --> 49:17.991
And what were the results
of this test?

49:18.024 --> 49:19.292
They were negative.

49:19.325 --> 49:21.595
LOWE: Well, now I'm confused

49:21.628 --> 49:24.698
because the defendant
subsequently admitted

49:24.731 --> 49:26.399
that he had held
and fired the gun.

49:26.432 --> 49:28.969
We believe that he either
wiped the residue off

49:29.002 --> 49:30.270
or he was wearing gloves.

49:30.303 --> 49:32.939
LOWE: So before he ran
to get the gun,

49:32.973 --> 49:35.108
he first ran to go put
on a pair of gloves.

49:35.141 --> 49:36.677
Objection--speculation.

49:36.710 --> 49:37.978
Overruled.

49:38.011 --> 49:39.546
He can state his opinion.

49:39.580 --> 49:41.682
McGUIRE: We think he was going
to hide his I. D.

49:41.715 --> 49:42.348
as the shooter,

49:42.382 --> 49:43.584
then changed his mind

49:43.617 --> 49:44.885
and went to self-defense.

49:44.918 --> 49:46.520
When you arrived, detective,

49:46.553 --> 49:48.254
how was the defendant dressed?

49:48.288 --> 49:49.222
McGUIRE: He was showered,

49:49.255 --> 49:50.957
wearing freshly
laundered clothes.

49:50.991 --> 49:52.659
The clothes he had
previously been seen in

49:52.693 --> 49:53.660
were in the washing machine.

49:53.694 --> 49:55.461
LOWE: The washing machine,

49:55.495 --> 49:56.830
was that on when you arrived?

49:56.863 --> 49:58.765
McGUIRE: No, but judging
from the heat

49:58.799 --> 50:00.333
on the surface
of the machine,

50:00.366 --> 50:01.635
we determined
that it had been on

50:01.668 --> 50:02.936
within the previous 40 minutes.

50:02.969 --> 50:04.871
So after the shooting,

50:04.905 --> 50:07.841
the defendant
did a load of laundry.

50:07.874 --> 50:10.544
Seems so.

50:10.577 --> 50:11.878
DONNELL: After a shooting
at this range,

50:11.912 --> 50:13.847
it's likely there
would be some blood splattered

50:13.880 --> 50:14.748
on Senator Ellison.

50:14.781 --> 50:15.549
Isn't that right, detective?

50:15.582 --> 50:16.783
Yes.

50:16.817 --> 50:18.351
DONNELL: Isn't it also likely,

50:18.384 --> 50:20.521
detective, that a person
might not want to stand

50:20.554 --> 50:21.888
around in bloody clothes?

50:21.922 --> 50:23.223
That's possible.

50:23.256 --> 50:25.726
DONNELL: And if one were
to take off bloody clothes,

50:25.759 --> 50:27.260
what would one likely
do with them?

50:27.293 --> 50:28.895
Fold them up, put them
back in the drawer?

50:28.929 --> 50:30.263
Objection.
Withdrawn.

50:30.296 --> 50:31.532
It's your testimony, detective,

50:31.565 --> 50:34.434
that because my client
washed his clothes,

50:34.467 --> 50:35.936
that made him suspicious.

50:35.969 --> 50:37.270
Yes, it's one thing--

50:37.303 --> 50:39.005
DONNELL: You've answered
the question. Thank you.

50:39.039 --> 50:41.508
You also testified
that he had taken a shower.

50:41.542 --> 50:42.709
McGUIRE: Which I also
found suspicious.

50:42.743 --> 50:43.644
DONNELL: Preposterous to think

50:43.677 --> 50:46.179
that a person
splattered with blood

50:46.212 --> 50:47.413
might want to wash himself?

50:47.447 --> 50:49.983
I found it a little preposterous
that he would shower

50:50.016 --> 50:52.719
and do laundry before
even calling the police, yes.

50:52.753 --> 50:54.220
DONNELL: Oh, you know
he did those things

50:54.254 --> 50:55.421
before Ms. Frutt
called the police?

50:55.455 --> 50:57.057
I know he did them
before we arrived.

50:57.090 --> 50:59.459
That wasn't your statement,
detective.

50:59.492 --> 51:02.729
Your conclusion was he did them
before you were called.

51:02.763 --> 51:05.165
Can you state that
to a conclusion, detective?

51:05.198 --> 51:05.999
No.

51:06.032 --> 51:07.568
DONNELL:
So this was a conclusion

51:07.601 --> 51:08.602
you just leapt to?

51:08.635 --> 51:09.970
No--
DONNELL: You just took

51:10.003 --> 51:11.171
the evidence found

51:11.204 --> 51:12.839
and made it fit
with your theory.

51:12.873 --> 51:14.174
Objection--argumentative.

51:14.207 --> 51:15.341
Sustained.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.177
Ever known it to be
the case, detective,

51:17.210 --> 51:19.513
where one holds the gun,
shoots it even,

51:19.546 --> 51:21.347
and the trace metal test
comes up negative?

51:21.381 --> 51:23.249
Very unlikely.
DONNELL: Ever known it

51:23.283 --> 51:25.819
to happen, detective?
Yes.

51:25.852 --> 51:27.921
DONNELL: And if one were
to take a shower, detective,

51:27.954 --> 51:31.057
would that make it
more or less likely

51:31.091 --> 51:33.627
for the trace metal test
to come up negative?

51:33.660 --> 51:36.029
Washing the hands doesn't nec--
DONNELL: My question,

51:36.062 --> 51:38.765
detective, is would showering

51:38.799 --> 51:40.867
make it more or less likely

51:40.901 --> 51:42.035
for the trace metal test

51:42.068 --> 51:43.670
to come up negative?

51:43.704 --> 51:45.606
I would say more likely, but--

51:45.639 --> 51:47.841
DONNELL: So it's likely

51:47.874 --> 51:50.176
my client didn't wear gloves

51:50.210 --> 51:51.344
like you think.

51:52.546 --> 51:53.479
That's possible.

51:53.514 --> 51:55.281
Thank you, detective.

51:58.418 --> 52:00.153
I thought you crossed him well.

52:00.186 --> 52:01.087
BERLUTI: We still got to deal

52:01.121 --> 52:02.355
with no fingerprints,

52:02.388 --> 52:03.724
why the gun was wiped clean.

52:03.757 --> 52:05.291
Marsha covers
that in her testimony.

52:05.325 --> 52:07.794
That was a weak opening
for the prosecution.

52:07.828 --> 52:09.062
I'm surprised
they led with that.

52:09.095 --> 52:10.030
What else have they got?

52:10.063 --> 52:11.331
Who's next?

52:11.364 --> 52:12.365
BERLUTI: Jason Pearlmutter,

52:12.398 --> 52:13.333
former aide to the Senator.

52:13.366 --> 52:15.401
I'm ready for him.

52:15.435 --> 52:16.970
What did the consultant say?

52:17.003 --> 52:18.572
DOLE:
McGuire did come off credible,

52:18.605 --> 52:20.741
and phoning the lawyers
before calling the police

52:20.774 --> 52:22.809
didn't go over well.

52:22.843 --> 52:26.146
They thought you were
a little aggressive.

52:26.179 --> 52:27.881
What else?
That's basically it.

52:27.914 --> 52:29.482
They thought you did
a good job poking holes,

52:29.516 --> 52:31.017
but McGuire
still seemed reasonable

52:31.051 --> 52:32.385
and, ultimately,
they believed him.

52:33.954 --> 52:35.121
YOUNG: You got to take care
of Pearlmutter.

52:38.491 --> 52:40.761
Something was bothering him
the whole week.

52:40.794 --> 52:41.862
LOWE: The week before
the shooting?

52:41.895 --> 52:44.464
Yes, Senator Ellison
is typically

52:44.497 --> 52:46.032
a very affable person

52:46.066 --> 52:47.968
and rather easygoing
for somebody

52:48.001 --> 52:50.136
with the stress
of his kind of work,

52:50.170 --> 52:51.738
but in the days
before the shooting,

52:51.772 --> 52:53.473
something was troubling him.

52:53.507 --> 52:54.841
How were you in a position

52:54.875 --> 52:56.643
to notice all this,
Mr. Pearlmutter?

52:56.677 --> 52:57.844
I was his aide.

52:57.878 --> 52:59.880
I was typically with him
12 hours a day.

52:59.913 --> 53:01.281
Did you ask him
what was wrong?

53:01.314 --> 53:02.549
Objection--hearsay.

53:02.583 --> 53:03.950
Declaration against interest.

53:03.984 --> 53:05.552
I'll allow it.

53:05.586 --> 53:06.653
LOWE: Did you ask him, sir?

53:06.687 --> 53:08.254
Yes, he indicated

53:08.288 --> 53:09.355
it was stuff at home.

53:09.389 --> 53:11.124
And you took that to mean...

53:11.157 --> 53:12.392
Problems with his marriage.

53:12.425 --> 53:14.127
LOWE: How did you come
to take it that way?

53:14.160 --> 53:15.662
PEARLMUTTER:
Well, he would indicate

53:15.696 --> 53:17.163
that he and his wife would go

53:17.197 --> 53:18.799
through bouts of estrangement,

53:18.832 --> 53:21.301
and after working for him
for 11 years

53:21.334 --> 53:23.236
I developed a pretty
good barometer

53:23.269 --> 53:25.271
for detecting when things
weren't going well.

53:25.305 --> 53:27.140
And the days
before the shooting,

53:27.173 --> 53:28.509
this was one of those times,

53:28.542 --> 53:29.442
in your opinion.

53:29.475 --> 53:30.877
Yes.

53:33.647 --> 53:36.082
FRUTT: Are you a psychologist?
PEARLMUTTER: No.

53:36.116 --> 53:38.752
Did Senator Ellison tell you
he was having troubles

53:38.785 --> 53:39.452
with his wife?

53:39.485 --> 53:40.954
No, not specifically.

53:40.987 --> 53:42.889
But you have a barometer.

53:42.923 --> 53:45.291
He said "Stuff at home."

53:45.325 --> 53:48.128
And you just took that to mean
problems with the wife.

53:48.161 --> 53:51.231
I had also seen them
together many times, Ms. Frutt,

53:51.264 --> 53:53.033
and witnessed the estrangement.

53:53.066 --> 53:54.535
He has a daughter, Allison.

53:54.568 --> 53:55.936
Did you know that?
Of course.

53:55.969 --> 53:57.403
FRUTT: Did you know
that she was arrested

53:57.437 --> 53:59.239
for possession
of marijuana last year?

54:01.307 --> 54:03.577
No.
FRUTT: So stuff at home goes on

54:03.610 --> 54:04.645
that you don't know about.

54:04.678 --> 54:05.812
Isn't that right,
Mr. Pearlmutter?

54:05.846 --> 54:08.148
I never laid claim
to knowing everything

54:08.181 --> 54:10.150
that goes on in his household.
Of course not.

54:10.183 --> 54:13.086
So when Senator Ellison
said "Stuff at home,"

54:13.119 --> 54:14.721
you were only guessing

54:14.755 --> 54:16.489
that it involved his wife,
weren't you, sir?

54:16.523 --> 54:19.526
Again, after 11 years
of working with the man--

54:19.560 --> 54:21.127
You've got that barometer.

54:21.161 --> 54:21.862
Objection.

54:21.895 --> 54:22.796
Sustained.

54:26.366 --> 54:27.300
Nothing further.

54:29.670 --> 54:32.338
You're in some trouble.
Why?

54:32.372 --> 54:33.974
Well, you're asking them
to believe

54:34.007 --> 54:35.375
he shot a man by mistake

54:35.408 --> 54:36.510
who just happened
to be sleeping

54:36.543 --> 54:37.578
with his wife at the time.

54:37.611 --> 54:38.645
Which is what happened.

54:38.679 --> 54:40.914
DOLE: Maybe so,
but for the jury to believe it,

54:40.947 --> 54:43.349
everything
has to be going our way.

54:43.383 --> 54:45.418
With this suggestion
of marital troubles,

54:45.451 --> 54:47.087
it just makes it
a little hard to believe

54:47.120 --> 54:48.522
that Keith
didn't have some inkling

54:48.555 --> 54:49.690
of what was going on.

54:49.723 --> 54:51.525
Is that what
the consultants think?

54:51.558 --> 54:52.726
WASHINGTON: It's what I think.

54:52.759 --> 54:53.794
YOUNG: Who's up next?

54:53.827 --> 54:55.095
Candace Levy,

54:55.128 --> 54:57.531
she's just to help establish
the affair which,

54:57.564 --> 54:58.999
since nobody's arguing,

54:59.032 --> 55:01.001
I don't know why they're still
bothering to call her.

55:01.034 --> 55:02.936
They're calling her
to set the idea.

55:02.969 --> 55:04.638
The more people
who knew about it,

55:04.671 --> 55:06.272
the more likely
the Senator knew about it.

55:06.306 --> 55:08.241
Well, there's nothing
she can say

55:08.274 --> 55:09.242
that will really hurt us

55:09.275 --> 55:10.944
and, besides,
she's the only one

55:10.977 --> 55:11.845
who seemed to know about it.

55:11.878 --> 55:13.046
Who's after that?

55:13.079 --> 55:14.214
FRUTT:
They still might call Allison

55:14.247 --> 55:15.415
to establish a time frame.

55:15.448 --> 55:17.283
She's not going
to give them any help.

55:17.317 --> 55:18.852
They won't dare call her.

55:20.286 --> 55:23.790
(indistinct chatter)

55:23.824 --> 55:25.526
GAMBLE: It might be
worth calling her.

55:25.559 --> 55:27.694
Why?
GAMBLE: Well, it was so obvious

55:27.728 --> 55:28.695
before that she was lying

55:28.729 --> 55:29.830
to protect her father.

55:29.863 --> 55:31.431
If it's that's obvious
to a jury,

55:31.464 --> 55:33.333
it's got to work in our favor.

55:33.366 --> 55:34.601
All we got to do
is catch them

55:34.635 --> 55:36.537
in one lie even
if it's the daughter's.

55:36.570 --> 55:39.105
No, Helen, they're planning
to call her.

55:39.139 --> 55:41.207
That means they prepped her
for cross.

55:41.241 --> 55:43.109
It's too dangerous.

55:43.143 --> 55:44.778
Are you ready with Levy?
Yes.

55:46.913 --> 55:49.049
You hear what they're calling
us on the news?

55:49.082 --> 55:50.483
The steam team.

55:50.517 --> 55:51.317
Why is that?

55:51.351 --> 55:52.152
GAMBLE: I don't know.

55:52.185 --> 55:54.888
Maybe because
they think I'm hot

55:54.921 --> 55:57.758
and steamy and you--

55:57.791 --> 55:59.826
because you're sitting
next to me.

56:01.494 --> 56:02.428
Must be it.

56:03.730 --> 56:05.131
Hmm.

56:05.165 --> 56:06.667
You like being
on the news, huh?

56:06.700 --> 56:08.101
If it gets me noticed

56:08.134 --> 56:10.136
by some rich admirer

56:10.170 --> 56:11.705
who whisks me off to Fiji

56:11.738 --> 56:13.073
to lick caviar off my thighs,

56:13.106 --> 56:15.108
I--well,
you can't beat that.

56:16.109 --> 56:17.711
You ever notice how,
in a big trial,

56:17.744 --> 56:19.613
any place far off
seems pretty good?

56:21.515 --> 56:22.849
(sighs)

56:22.883 --> 56:24.217
Think we'll get him?

56:24.250 --> 56:25.586
I hope so.

56:27.253 --> 56:29.455
I keep hearing that press
conference in my head.

56:31.124 --> 56:32.192
The man is good.

56:41.301 --> 56:43.970
JACK: All in all, it wasn't
a terribly powerful day

56:44.004 --> 56:45.005
for the prosecution,

56:45.038 --> 56:48.074
but the consensus
is it didn't need to be.

56:48.108 --> 56:50.977
Though technically the burden
is on the state,

56:51.011 --> 56:54.715
most experts feel
that burden has really shifted

56:54.748 --> 56:56.583
to the defense in this case.

56:56.617 --> 56:58.519
I'm getting
a bad feeling, Bobby.

56:58.552 --> 56:59.620
Anything on the table?

56:59.653 --> 57:02.155
No, we haven't even put
in our case yet.

57:02.188 --> 57:03.657
Our case?

57:03.690 --> 57:06.359
Well, a big part of it
is Marsha's unflinching support,

57:06.392 --> 57:07.528
which isn't so great.

57:07.561 --> 57:09.863
She'll say
what she needs to say.

57:11.231 --> 57:13.033
I got a bad feeling.

57:16.737 --> 57:18.805
LEVY: It was an office party

57:18.839 --> 57:20.574
in honor of one
of the vice presidents

57:20.607 --> 57:21.908
who was retiring.

57:21.942 --> 57:23.810
Mr. McNoun was there.

57:23.844 --> 57:26.212
So was Mr. Ellison
with his wife.

57:26.246 --> 57:27.914
What's your position,
Ms. Levy?

57:27.948 --> 57:30.183
I'm the head of accounting.

57:30.216 --> 57:31.885
GAMBLE: And who was your
direct superior?

57:31.918 --> 57:33.520
It was Mr. McNoun.

57:33.554 --> 57:35.455
He was chief
financial officer.

57:35.488 --> 57:37.057
Did you know Mrs. Ellison?

57:37.090 --> 57:39.292
Yes, she also works at Reynolds.

57:39.325 --> 57:41.127
I never dealt directly
with her.

57:41.161 --> 57:43.129
GAMBLE: Ms. Levy,
calling your attention

57:43.163 --> 57:45.065
to the night
of the office party in July,

57:45.098 --> 57:47.000
did you have occasion
to observe

57:47.033 --> 57:49.369
either Mr. McNoun
or Mrs. Ellison?

57:49.402 --> 57:51.505
Yes, I observed them both

57:51.538 --> 57:53.740
when they sort of
darted into his office.

57:53.774 --> 57:54.741
They darted?

57:54.775 --> 57:57.143
LEVY: Well, they went
in rather quickly.

57:57.177 --> 57:58.712
What did you see next?

57:58.745 --> 58:01.915
Well, I didn't exactly
see anything,

58:01.948 --> 58:03.750
but I'm ashamed to admit

58:03.784 --> 58:06.019
I did a little eavesdropping
by the door.

58:06.052 --> 58:08.454
GAMBLE: Any particular reason
you would do that?

58:08.488 --> 58:10.356
LEVY: Well, I suspected

58:10.390 --> 58:11.958
there was something going on
between them.

58:11.992 --> 58:13.026
GAMBLE: Why?

58:13.059 --> 58:15.796
Just body language
when they interacted.

58:15.829 --> 58:17.497
I could tell.

58:17.531 --> 58:19.900
Now, while you were doing
your eavesdropping by the door,

58:19.933 --> 58:21.234
what, if anything,
did you hear?

58:21.267 --> 58:23.069
Not too much because the party

58:23.103 --> 58:24.270
was rather loud,

58:24.304 --> 58:26.306
but I could hear she was angry,

58:26.339 --> 58:27.541
and I heard her say,

58:27.574 --> 58:29.242
"It has to stop."

58:29.275 --> 58:31.311
and she sounded angry.

58:31.344 --> 58:32.746
GAMBLE: Did you hear
anything else?

58:32.779 --> 58:34.581
No, that was all I heard.

58:34.615 --> 58:37.383
A few seconds later,
she kind of huffed out,

58:37.417 --> 58:38.719
and I looked in.

58:38.752 --> 58:41.321
He seemed very upset.

58:41.354 --> 58:42.388
GAMBLE: Ms. Levy,

58:42.422 --> 58:44.490
did you ever
have the opportunity

58:44.525 --> 58:47.528
to hear any conversation
between Mr. McNoun

58:47.561 --> 58:48.929
and the defendant?

58:48.962 --> 58:50.296
Yes,

58:50.330 --> 58:52.866
that same night.

58:52.899 --> 58:53.934
GAMBLE: At the party?

58:53.967 --> 58:55.401
LEVY: Yes,

58:55.435 --> 58:58.071
after Mrs. Ellison left
Mr. McNoun's office,

58:58.104 --> 59:00.541
about a minute later,
I saw him go in.

59:00.574 --> 59:01.441
GAMBLE: The defendant?

59:01.474 --> 59:03.143
LEVY: Yes.

59:03.176 --> 59:05.145
Did you hear what,
if anything, was said?

59:05.178 --> 59:07.948
The Senator was also very upset,

59:07.981 --> 59:10.283
and I heard him say
something like,

59:10.316 --> 59:12.886
"I will not be humiliated."

59:12.919 --> 59:14.354
he said it twice.

59:14.387 --> 59:16.489
"I will not let myself
be humiliated."

59:16.523 --> 59:17.423
those were his words.

59:17.457 --> 59:18.424
GAMBLE: Then what?

59:18.458 --> 59:19.860
LEVY: He stormed out.

59:19.893 --> 59:21.828
GAMBLE: Ms. Levy,
are you positive

59:21.862 --> 59:23.329
that this was July 10th,

59:23.363 --> 59:25.031
two days before the shooting?

59:25.065 --> 59:26.499
Absolutely positive.

59:26.533 --> 59:27.768
Thank you, Ms. Levy.

59:27.801 --> 59:28.569
Nothing further.

59:34.941 --> 59:36.710
Ms. Levy,

59:36.743 --> 59:38.111
you and I
had a conversation

59:38.144 --> 59:39.880
about the events at this party,

59:39.913 --> 59:41.648
did we not?
Yes.

59:41.682 --> 59:43.717
BERLUTI: I asked you
if you had any reason

59:43.750 --> 59:45.919
to suspect
a romantic relationship

59:45.952 --> 59:49.022
between Mrs. Ellison
and Mr. McNoun.

59:49.055 --> 59:50.190
LEVY: Yes, you did.

59:50.223 --> 59:52.559
BERLUTI: You told me
all about how Mrs. Ellison

59:52.593 --> 59:54.160
went into Mr. McNoun's office.

59:54.194 --> 59:55.195
That's correct,

59:55.228 --> 59:56.797
same as I've said here.

59:56.830 --> 59:58.098
BERLUTI: Yes, well,

59:58.131 --> 59:59.432
did you ever tell me

59:59.465 --> 01:00:02.368
you saw the defendant go
into Mr. McNoun's office?

01:00:02.402 --> 01:00:03.670
I don't believe I did.

01:00:03.704 --> 01:00:05.305
Why is that, Ms. Levy?

01:00:05.338 --> 01:00:07.508
You didn't ask.

01:00:17.183 --> 01:00:18.852
Do you have a comment
on what just happened?

01:00:18.885 --> 01:00:21.354
Mr. Donnell, how do you feel?
No comment.

01:00:21.387 --> 01:00:23.123
MAN: Any comments
on Ms. Levy's testimony?

01:00:23.156 --> 01:00:24.825
MAN: Senator Ellison,
did you know the man?

01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:28.194
(indistinct chatter)

01:00:28.228 --> 01:00:29.495
WOMAN: Senator Ellison--

01:00:30.897 --> 01:00:32.432
BERLUTI: It's unfair surprise.

01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:34.300
That testimony--
It isn't unfair surprise.

01:00:34.334 --> 01:00:35.969
She was on their list.
BERLUTI: Not to say that--

01:00:36.002 --> 01:00:38.038
It isn't unfair surprise!

01:00:38.071 --> 01:00:40.240
It was a screw-up,
and it was yours, Jimmy!

01:00:40.273 --> 01:00:41.742
How could you miss--
Hey--

01:00:41.775 --> 01:00:43.076
DONNELL: All right.
She's lying!

01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:44.578
They put her up there to lie!

01:00:53.186 --> 01:00:54.454
Was she lying, Keith ?

01:00:54.487 --> 01:00:57.423
(music playing)

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:04.064
You knew.

01:01:04.097 --> 01:01:05.732
You knew about the affair.

01:01:09.903 --> 01:01:11.838
So you murdered him.
Ellenor.

01:01:11.872 --> 01:01:13.373
I am talking
to the client.

01:01:13.406 --> 01:01:14.207
I'm not interested

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.976
in what the client
has to say.

01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:18.078
If we plan to keep going
with self-defense,

01:01:18.111 --> 01:01:19.279
you're not interested

01:01:19.312 --> 01:01:20.714
in anything the client
has to say.

01:01:20.747 --> 01:01:22.549
Are we clear?

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:27.120
Can you see if they're
still willing to plea?

01:01:27.153 --> 01:01:28.522
KEITH: I don't want to plea.

01:01:28.555 --> 01:01:29.189
I can't.

01:01:29.222 --> 01:01:30.757
Keith, they've got you.

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:31.792
Can't you--
KEITH: If I plead out

01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:32.959
after that testimony,

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:34.628
I'm guilty to the world--
MARSHA: Are you still worried

01:01:34.661 --> 01:01:35.762
about becoming Governor?

01:01:35.796 --> 01:01:37.097
You can't be serious.
KEITH: That woman doesn't know

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.298
what she heard.
She can't be sure--

01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:40.200
MARSHA: Oh, don't be an idiot.
KEITH: There's still--

01:01:40.233 --> 01:01:41.334
reasonable doubt.
You are guilty--

01:01:41.367 --> 01:01:42.636
in everybody's eyes--
KEITH: The prosecution has the--

01:01:42.669 --> 01:01:43.870
they are the--

01:01:43.904 --> 01:01:44.571
Shut up!

01:02:01.287 --> 01:02:03.790
All right, look.

01:02:03.824 --> 01:02:05.559
There's not going
to be any plea offer

01:02:05.592 --> 01:02:07.093
from the prosecution
at this point.

01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:08.762
Our only course is to proceed

01:02:08.795 --> 01:02:10.897
with self-defense.

01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:13.233
We argue that the woman
heard it wrong.

01:02:13.266 --> 01:02:14.234
It was a loud party,

01:02:14.267 --> 01:02:15.702
she had certain predispositions,

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:18.505
and she heard
what she wanted to hear.

01:02:19.472 --> 01:02:20.206
You will have to account

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.274
for what she thinks she heard

01:02:21.307 --> 01:02:23.309
in your testimony.

01:02:23.343 --> 01:02:24.745
Your testimony stays the same.

01:02:24.778 --> 01:02:26.179
You will go up first

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:27.748
to describe your father's calm,

01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:30.917
pleasant demeanor
as he came home that night.

01:02:30.951 --> 01:02:32.819
We tell the truth.

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:34.988
This is not over.

01:02:35.021 --> 01:02:37.591
It will be if we fall apart.

01:02:39.826 --> 01:02:41.795
(sighs) I'll check
with the clerk

01:02:41.828 --> 01:02:43.029
to see when we go back.

01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:01.481
ANCHOR (over TV): Obviously,
this was a devastating setback

01:03:01.515 --> 01:03:02.649
for the defense.

01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:04.250
If Senator Ellison, in fact,

01:03:04.284 --> 01:03:05.586
knew of the affair,

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:07.554
he's hard-pressed
to convince the jury

01:03:07.588 --> 01:03:09.422
he thought his wife
was under attack

01:03:09.455 --> 01:03:12.092
when he went running in
with the revolver.

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:12.893
You've been watching--

01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:14.327
Just shut it off,
would you, please?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.096
I know this is out there,

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:17.731
but is there any precedent set

01:03:17.764 --> 01:03:19.299
for changing the plea
to insanity

01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:20.033
this late in the game?

01:03:20.066 --> 01:03:21.434
No.

01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:23.003
The judge would never allow it.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:26.206
Where's Jimmy?

01:03:26.239 --> 01:03:27.508
Conference room.

01:03:28.975 --> 01:03:29.676
Ellenor.

01:03:35.248 --> 01:03:37.483
I know you're dejected,

01:03:37.518 --> 01:03:38.852
but the jury cannot see

01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:41.722
the face I'm looking at
right now.

01:03:41.755 --> 01:03:43.023
Remember his press conference?

01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:45.559
If he's great on the stand,

01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:46.560
who knows?

01:03:49.129 --> 01:03:50.864
One more thing
this may not be the time,

01:03:50.897 --> 01:03:51.965
but I'm going to say it anyway.

01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:53.333
I don't ever,

01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:55.135
ever want to hear you attack

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:56.136
a member of this law firm

01:03:56.169 --> 01:03:58.004
in front of a client again.

01:03:58.038 --> 01:04:00.807
Never mind the disrespect
to Jimmy,

01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:03.309
we don't need to be inviting
malpractice claims.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:20.160
Mistakes happen, Jimmy.

01:04:20.193 --> 01:04:22.328
No point in dwelling on it,

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:25.198
other than to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:38.111
(sighs)

01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:40.080
(indistinct chatter)

01:04:47.788 --> 01:04:49.723
MAN: Will your client
be making any statement?

01:04:49.756 --> 01:04:52.693
(reporters shouting questions)

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.100
MAN: That's it.

01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:01.635
Stay back. Stay back.

01:05:02.836 --> 01:05:05.539
We have an extremely
difficult decision here.

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:07.307
We need you to listen to us

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.942
and consider this carefully.

01:05:11.578 --> 01:05:13.346
Your fate...

01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:15.415
is obviously in your hands now.

01:05:16.717 --> 01:05:17.818
For your testimony,

01:05:17.851 --> 01:05:20.587
you can maintain self-defense.

01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:23.023
For anybody else,
I would consider that ludicrous,

01:05:23.056 --> 01:05:25.692
but...

01:05:25.726 --> 01:05:27.093
you have a gift

01:05:27.127 --> 01:05:29.462
when it comes to persuasion.

01:05:29.495 --> 01:05:30.864
Personally, I think

01:05:30.897 --> 01:05:32.799
it's rabbit out of the hat time,

01:05:34.067 --> 01:05:35.368
but juries are loath

01:05:35.401 --> 01:05:37.303
to convict celebrities
sometimes.

01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:41.675
Now...

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.009
there is an alternative.

01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:44.410
Which is?

01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:48.281
FRUTT: You could do
a big mea culpa.

01:05:48.314 --> 01:05:51.217
Admit that you acted
in a fit of rage.

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.986
And what would be
the purpose of that?

01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:54.354
DONNELL: I think the jury
might believe it,

01:05:54.387 --> 01:05:56.523
and you'd have a shot
at manslaughter.

01:05:56.557 --> 01:05:58.925
If you stick to a story
the jury perceives to be a lie,

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:01.895
our fear is they would hit you
with murder one.

01:06:01.928 --> 01:06:04.565
The difference is six years

01:06:04.598 --> 01:06:06.066
versus life without parole.

01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:11.538
Those are not choices, Ellenor.

01:06:11.572 --> 01:06:14.508
You didn't leave us
with many, Keith.

01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:17.277
You people have pulled
miracles before.

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:19.012
Not when--
KEITH: I can't go

01:06:19.045 --> 01:06:22.082
before the public
and say I lied.

01:06:22.115 --> 01:06:23.550
FRUTT: Keith...

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:26.987
we're not talking
about re-election anymore.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.755
We're talking--
I want my miracle.

01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:31.725
(music playing)

01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:40.300
It's not coming, Keith.

01:06:46.607 --> 01:06:48.274
Now tell us
what you want to do.

01:06:54.948 --> 01:06:57.518
I'm gonna take the stand,

01:06:57.551 --> 01:06:58.819
and I'm gonna testify

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:01.254
that I acted in self-defense.

01:07:01.287 --> 01:07:03.189
You're going to go to prison.

01:07:03.223 --> 01:07:04.190
No, I'm not.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.661
No, I'm not.

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:10.631
(music playing)

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:24.044
(music playing)

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:54.174
You remember how we used
to talk Shakespeare,

01:07:54.207 --> 01:07:56.743
who our favorite
tragic heroes were?

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:00.213
You're about to tell me
I've become

01:08:00.246 --> 01:08:02.716
your favorite tragic hero.

01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:07.320
Our friendship kind of waned
a little, Keith.

01:08:07.353 --> 01:08:09.022
I became a blight,

01:08:09.055 --> 01:08:10.691
the unseemly defense attorney

01:08:10.724 --> 01:08:13.326
who represents rapists
and murderers.

01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:14.895
Not great photo ops

01:08:14.928 --> 01:08:16.162
to be seen hanging
around with me.

01:08:16.196 --> 01:08:17.330
I got it, Keith.

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:19.131
That isn't true.

01:08:19.165 --> 01:08:20.600
Yes, it is.

01:08:23.169 --> 01:08:25.205
But, nevertheless,

01:08:25.238 --> 01:08:27.707
you came to me, Keith.

01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:29.843
Because for somebody charged
with murder,

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:32.212
there is no better friend
in the world

01:08:32.245 --> 01:08:33.846
to have than me

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.983
and my firm.

01:08:37.017 --> 01:08:38.852
You need to listen

01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:42.923
to the expertise you hired.

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:45.325
If you stick with self-defense,

01:08:45.358 --> 01:08:47.694
it is my belief...

01:08:47.728 --> 01:08:49.162
you will lose.

01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:52.165
If I tell them

01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:55.001
I lied, Ellenor,

01:08:55.035 --> 01:08:57.370
everything I worked for,
it's over.

01:08:57.403 --> 01:09:00.406
Keith, you have
a daughter you love,

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:01.975
a wife--
KEITH: Who will leave me

01:09:02.008 --> 01:09:03.276
as soon as the trial ends.

01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:04.911
We both know that.

01:09:04.944 --> 01:09:06.912
And she'll try to take
Allison with her.

01:09:08.413 --> 01:09:11.151
I can't win this.

01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:14.154
Yes, you can.

01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:18.759
All we need is one juror.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.698
People love me, Ellenor.

01:09:26.733 --> 01:09:28.669
They love me.

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:36.510
WOMAN: Ms. Frutt,
what's your new plan--

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:38.745
FRUTT: I've got no comment.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.046
Excuse me!

01:09:41.615 --> 01:09:42.916
I've got no comment.

01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:45.586
(indistinct chatter)

01:09:45.618 --> 01:09:47.420
Get away from me!

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:50.090
(reporters shouting)

01:09:50.122 --> 01:09:51.091
MAN: Come on. Keep it moving.

01:09:51.124 --> 01:09:52.058
Let's go.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.095
What happened?

01:09:55.128 --> 01:09:57.030
He's digging in.

01:09:57.063 --> 01:09:59.065
(Sighs) Okay.

01:09:59.099 --> 01:10:00.601
We call Allison,

01:10:00.634 --> 01:10:01.535
up and down,

01:10:01.568 --> 01:10:03.737
and then we call Marsha.

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:04.437
Are you okay to do this?

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:05.772
I'm fine.

01:10:07.173 --> 01:10:08.575
Ellenor,

01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:09.710
I'm sorry.

01:10:09.743 --> 01:10:12.312
Jimmy, it's not your fault.

01:10:14.247 --> 01:10:15.215
DONNELL: Come on,
we got to get in.

01:10:18.919 --> 01:10:21.321
FRUTT: How would you describe
your relationship with your dad?

01:10:22.756 --> 01:10:23.924
Extremely close.

01:10:23.957 --> 01:10:26.092
Extremely close.

01:10:26.126 --> 01:10:28.194
Were you aware of any
marital problems

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:29.563
between him and your mom?

01:10:29.596 --> 01:10:31.698
They had fights.

01:10:31.732 --> 01:10:32.866
They would have difficult times,

01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:34.367
and things would improve.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.970
Was that difficult on you?

01:10:37.003 --> 01:10:38.104
Sometimes.

01:10:38.138 --> 01:10:40.874
FRUTT: Did you ever talk
about it with your father?

01:10:40.907 --> 01:10:42.876
Yes.

01:10:42.909 --> 01:10:45.245
FRUTT: Did he ever talk
about what he thought

01:10:45.278 --> 01:10:48.181
were the problems
between your mother and him?

01:10:48.214 --> 01:10:50.250
Yes.
FRUTT: Did he ever reveal

01:10:50.283 --> 01:10:52.653
an awareness to you
about your mother's affair

01:10:52.686 --> 01:10:54.087
with Mr. McNoun?

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:54.788
Never.

01:10:54.821 --> 01:10:56.422
FRUTT: Now, Allison,

01:10:56.456 --> 01:10:58.191
given your relationship
with your father,

01:10:58.224 --> 01:11:01.294
do you think he would've
told you about this affair?

01:11:01.327 --> 01:11:02.896
I do.

01:11:02.929 --> 01:11:04.130
FRUTT: Do you have an opinion

01:11:04.164 --> 01:11:07.300
as to whether he knew
about this affair?

01:11:07.333 --> 01:11:10.403
My opinion is that he did not.

01:11:10.436 --> 01:11:11.705
FRUTT: Calling your attention

01:11:11.738 --> 01:11:12.639
to the night of the shooting,

01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:14.074
could you please tell us

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:16.042
what happened
from your perspective?

01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:20.180
Well...

01:11:20.213 --> 01:11:23.617
the movie we'd gone to see
was sold out,

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:26.152
so we came back home.

01:11:26.186 --> 01:11:28.221
We came into the house.

01:11:28.254 --> 01:11:30.323
Dad went to the family room,

01:11:30.657 --> 01:11:32.025
I headed upstairs.

01:11:33.894 --> 01:11:35.596
And that's when I heard them.

01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:37.197
Heard who?

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.132
My mother...

01:11:39.165 --> 01:11:41.034
and Mr. McNoun.

01:11:42.502 --> 01:11:44.705
You heard them?

01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:47.107
ALLISON: They were in her bed

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.675
doing what they usually did

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:51.044
when dad and I
were out of the house.

01:11:51.077 --> 01:11:53.146
Wait a second. You knew...

01:11:53.179 --> 01:11:54.881
it was Mr. McNoun?

01:11:54.915 --> 01:11:57.918
My father didn't know
about the affair,

01:11:57.951 --> 01:12:00.153
but I certainly did.

01:12:00.186 --> 01:12:03.389
FRUTT: Well, when you heard them
that night,

01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:04.257
you didn't tell your father?

01:12:05.225 --> 01:12:06.259
ALLISON: No.

01:12:06.292 --> 01:12:08.428
You just went back to your room?

01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:11.464
Eventually.

01:12:11.497 --> 01:12:13.499
Eventually?

01:12:13.534 --> 01:12:14.901
First, I got the gun,

01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:16.537
and I shot Mr. McNoun.

01:12:17.804 --> 01:12:20.907
(indistinct chatter)

01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:21.742
Your Honor.

01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:23.209
Chambers!

01:12:28.615 --> 01:12:30.851
I had no idea
she was gonna say that.

01:12:30.884 --> 01:12:32.986
None of us did.
I don't believe it for a second.

01:12:33.019 --> 01:12:34.821
FINKEL: Let me talk here.

01:12:34.855 --> 01:12:36.256
Did she ever suggest to you

01:12:36.289 --> 01:12:37.190
she was the shooter?

01:12:37.223 --> 01:12:38.324
No.
LOWE: She just lied

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:39.860
to get her father off.
Mr. Lowe,

01:12:39.893 --> 01:12:42.028
let me conduct
this session, please.

01:12:42.062 --> 01:12:43.096
DONNELL: Your Honor,

01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:44.430
none of us saw this coming.

01:12:44.464 --> 01:12:46.232
GAMBLE: She previously
had given a statement

01:12:46.266 --> 01:12:47.634
that she went to her room

01:12:47.668 --> 01:12:49.369
and she heard the shots.

01:12:49.402 --> 01:12:50.771
This was blatant perjury.

01:12:50.804 --> 01:12:52.472
Maybe it was.

01:12:52.506 --> 01:12:54.240
But your only remedy
for this trial

01:12:54.274 --> 01:12:56.309
is rigorous cross, Ms. Gamble.

01:12:56.342 --> 01:12:57.944
What else can we do?

01:12:57.978 --> 01:12:59.212
GAMBLE: I'll make a deal
with her right now.

01:12:59.245 --> 01:13:01.081
I'll drop all perjury charges

01:13:01.114 --> 01:13:02.783
in exchange
for admitting her lie.

01:13:02.816 --> 01:13:03.884
She's got an out.

01:13:03.917 --> 01:13:05.886
FRUTT: Well, even if she were
to agree to that,

01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:07.588
I'm not sure it's in
the Senator's interest.

01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:09.255
Which is why you
shouldn't be representing

01:13:09.289 --> 01:13:10.891
the daughter as well as--
FRUTT: I don't disagree

01:13:10.924 --> 01:13:12.425
with that, either,
at this point,

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.760
but the fact is, I am,

01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:15.028
and we have a situation.

01:13:15.061 --> 01:13:16.029
LOWE: The situation is,

01:13:16.062 --> 01:13:17.297
you have an ethical obligation

01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:18.865
to take the offer
to your client.

01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:20.300
We drop the perjury in exchange

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:21.367
for her recanting.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:22.636
Otherwise, she's gonna be taken

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:24.505
from that courtroom
into custody.

01:13:24.538 --> 01:13:25.939
DONNELL: Not in front
of the jury, she's not.

01:13:25.972 --> 01:13:27.440
GAMBLE: There's no statutory
minimum, Bobby.

01:13:27.473 --> 01:13:30.310
She could get 20 years.
That's enough.

01:13:30.343 --> 01:13:32.112
You have an offer to take
to the girl.

01:13:32.145 --> 01:13:33.346
If she refuses,

01:13:33.379 --> 01:13:35.949
your recourse is to try
to impeach her on the stand,

01:13:35.982 --> 01:13:38.084
and then arrest
her post-verdict.

01:13:38.118 --> 01:13:40.554
You, you, and you,

01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:42.789
I want your bar cards
by the end of the day.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:45.959
Excuse me?
I'll hold them in escrow.

01:13:45.992 --> 01:13:47.761
If it turns out what just
happened in there

01:13:47.794 --> 01:13:49.195
was one of those stunts

01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:51.431
you people have become
infamous for,

01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:53.534
you will lose them forever.

01:13:53.567 --> 01:13:54.601
That's my promise.

01:13:56.703 --> 01:13:59.640
(reporters chattering)

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:04.377
You have just committed
a very serious offense.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:05.378
What?

01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:06.547
Telling the truth under oath?

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:07.681
Oh, that's the truth?

01:14:07.714 --> 01:14:09.015
That's--
Ellenor.

01:14:12.185 --> 01:14:13.687
I'm willing to plead guilty.

01:14:15.922 --> 01:14:17.724
You wanna plead guilty now?

01:14:17.758 --> 01:14:19.325
Make the deal.

01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:21.194
BERLUTI: Senator,

01:14:21.227 --> 01:14:23.964
right now you actually
have a shot at acquittal--

01:14:23.997 --> 01:14:25.632
Just do it.

01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:26.700
I'm not gonna let my daughter

01:14:26.733 --> 01:14:28.101
take the fall--
Can I talk?

01:14:28.134 --> 01:14:29.169
KEITH: No.

01:14:29.202 --> 01:14:30.571
I think you've talked enough

01:14:30.604 --> 01:14:31.872
for one day, Allison.

01:14:31.905 --> 01:14:35.408
Somebody correct me
if I'm wrong,

01:14:35.441 --> 01:14:37.911
but I probably just gave you
reasonable doubt,

01:14:37.944 --> 01:14:40.180
so I--
You also confessed, Allison.

01:14:40.213 --> 01:14:41.782
They might try you for murder.

01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:43.016
ALLISON: And I'll just say

01:14:43.049 --> 01:14:45.552
my confession was a lie
to save my father.

01:14:46.386 --> 01:14:48.154
If he's acquitted,
they can't try him again.

01:14:48.188 --> 01:14:49.155
DONNELL: He may be safe,

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:51.191
but it's a pretty big risk
for you.

01:14:51.224 --> 01:14:53.026
And even if you beat murder,
that gets you on perjury--

01:14:53.059 --> 01:14:54.327
ALLISON: A 14-year-old girl

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.929
trying to save her daddy.

01:14:57.463 --> 01:14:59.032
Something tells me
I wouldn't go to jail

01:14:59.065 --> 01:15:00.366
for too long.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.935
Don't count on it.

01:15:07.941 --> 01:15:09.042
Are you really so sure

01:15:09.075 --> 01:15:11.211
I committed perjury,
Mr. Donnell?

01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:22.623
You're both covering for her.

01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:24.891
I want to plead guilty.

01:15:24.925 --> 01:15:26.560
Let's take a step back.

01:15:26.593 --> 01:15:28.729
KEITH: I'm the client here.

01:15:28.762 --> 01:15:30.764
I want to plead guilty,

01:15:30.797 --> 01:15:32.032
conditioned...

01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:34.968
on nothing happens to Allison.

01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:36.870
And I get to hold
a press conference,

01:15:36.903 --> 01:15:38.038
not in custody.

01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:40.306
Those are my terms.

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.708
Take it to the D. A.

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:44.978
Bobby?

01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:46.279
Can you take Allison and Marsha

01:15:46.312 --> 01:15:47.548
out the back door?

01:15:47.581 --> 01:15:48.815
I'd like to talk to Keith.

01:15:48.849 --> 01:15:51.484
Why?
FRUTT: I just...

01:15:51.518 --> 01:15:52.919
need a second.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.688
DONNELL: Let's go.

01:16:11.404 --> 01:16:14.107
If there is anything
you are more committed to

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.742
than your political career,

01:16:15.776 --> 01:16:16.977
it is your daughter.

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:24.217
Is she taking the rap for you

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.587
or have you been taking the fall
for her all along?

01:16:27.888 --> 01:16:29.189
I instructed you

01:16:29.222 --> 01:16:30.390
to plead guilty.

01:16:30.423 --> 01:16:32.158
FRUTT: Are you gonna answer
my question?

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:37.764
Make the deal.

01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:46.239
Manslaughter?

01:16:46.272 --> 01:16:47.307
DONNELL: And no charges brought

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.209
against the daughter
on anything.

01:16:49.242 --> 01:16:50.944
Plus, he gets to hold
a press conference

01:16:50.977 --> 01:16:52.679
before you take him off.
GAMBLE: Excuse me?

01:16:52.713 --> 01:16:54.214
DONNELL: He wants to make
a statement.

01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:56.216
GAMBLE: The question isn't
do you think I'm an idiot,

01:16:56.249 --> 01:16:58.151
it's how big of an idiot?
Helen...

01:16:58.184 --> 01:17:00.220
GAMBLE: Bobby,
this was your plan all along.

01:17:00.253 --> 01:17:01.788
It was not.
GAMBLE: If you think

01:17:01.822 --> 01:17:03.289
I'll allow you to use perjury

01:17:03.323 --> 01:17:04.858
to bolster your bargaining
position--

01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:06.760
DONNELL: That was not our plan,

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:08.529
and I'm offended
by your suggestion.

01:17:08.562 --> 01:17:09.930
Get out.
Helen--

01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:11.264
GAMBLE: I will not entertain

01:17:11.297 --> 01:17:12.766
any discussion, Bobby.

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.334
WALSH: Helen...

01:17:14.367 --> 01:17:15.636
LOWE: Can you wait outside
for a second?

01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:20.006
(door opens)

01:17:21.508 --> 01:17:23.009
I don't like this any more
than you do,

01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:25.111
but the fact is,
they've got reasonable doubt.

01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:26.312
When I get done crossing her,

01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:27.147
there's not--
LOWE: No. We have

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.582
no eyewitnesses,

01:17:28.615 --> 01:17:30.884
another person taking credit
for the crime,

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:34.254
a very charismatic
and persuasive defendant,

01:17:34.287 --> 01:17:35.822
we're in the crapper.

01:17:35.856 --> 01:17:37.858
And right now
you're blinded by anger.

01:17:37.891 --> 01:17:40.260
It sucks. No question.

01:17:40.293 --> 01:17:42.262
We're having our hand forced
by perjury,

01:17:42.295 --> 01:17:43.764
but the likelihood is,

01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:46.166
is that this was manslaughter.

01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:47.768
He flipped out,
and he shot the guy,

01:17:47.801 --> 01:17:49.135
and we would be crazy

01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:50.871
to walk away from this deal.

01:17:51.838 --> 01:17:53.874
WALSH: We can't risk
a straight acquittal.

01:17:53.907 --> 01:17:55.108
We just can't.

01:17:55.141 --> 01:17:56.743
I'm gonna accept it.

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:07.187
(door opens)

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.655
SCOTT (over TV):
It's absolute madness

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:09.723
in the corridor.

01:18:09.756 --> 01:18:11.457
The unconfirmed reports are,

01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:12.726
a plea has been reached.

01:18:12.759 --> 01:18:15.228
Do we know what it is?
Nobody calls.

01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:16.797
I'm informed now
they're in court,

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:18.398
and Judge Finkel is, in fact,

01:18:18.431 --> 01:18:20.100
being presented with a plea,

01:18:20.133 --> 01:18:21.334
which I'm now being told

01:18:21.367 --> 01:18:23.436
is a manslaughter conviction.

01:18:23.469 --> 01:18:26.439
(music playing)

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.782
FINKEL:
Defendant will please rise.

01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:39.720
You understand, Mr. Ellison,

01:18:39.753 --> 01:18:42.222
that you are pleading guilty
to a homicide?

01:18:42.255 --> 01:18:44.525
Yes.
FINKEL: And by pleading guilty

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:46.292
to manslaughter you are agreeing

01:18:46.326 --> 01:18:47.794
not to appeal

01:18:47.828 --> 01:18:49.262
and that you will serve
a sentence

01:18:49.295 --> 01:18:52.032
not less than six years
in state prison?

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.133
Yes, Your Honor.

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:54.500
FINKEL: Counsel,
you are recommending

01:18:54.535 --> 01:18:56.436
this agreement to your client.

01:18:56.469 --> 01:18:58.238
Your client understands
the terms

01:18:58.271 --> 01:18:59.339
and accepts them?

01:18:59.372 --> 01:19:00.874
Yes, Your Honor.

01:19:00.907 --> 01:19:02.175
Plea is accepted.

01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:04.144
So ordered by the court.

01:19:04.177 --> 01:19:06.547
Bailiff, take the defendant
into custody.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.414
FRUTT: Your Honor,
pursuant to the plea,

01:19:08.448 --> 01:19:09.950
my client gets to make
a statement.

01:19:09.983 --> 01:19:11.618
The area is set up
in the corridor.

01:19:11.652 --> 01:19:14.855
Security will escort
the defendant to the microphones

01:19:14.888 --> 01:19:16.723
and then into custody.

01:19:16.757 --> 01:19:17.991
We are adjourned.

01:19:18.024 --> 01:19:18.725
(gavel bangs)

01:19:22.462 --> 01:19:24.598
Keith, I've got to know.

01:19:24.631 --> 01:19:27.133
It's all over now,
so just tell me.

01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:32.739
I have to make my statement.

01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:42.315
GAMBLE: We are not at all

01:19:42.348 --> 01:19:43.650
satisfied with this outcome.

01:19:43.684 --> 01:19:46.119
We believe this was
a second degree murder,

01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:47.521
possibly first.

01:19:47.554 --> 01:19:48.955
We accepted this plea

01:19:48.989 --> 01:19:50.223
because we feared the perjury

01:19:50.256 --> 01:19:51.457
committed by the daughter

01:19:51.491 --> 01:19:54.961
could've severely
compromised our case.

01:19:54.995 --> 01:19:56.830
This is a terrible day.

01:19:56.863 --> 01:19:58.665
We just made the best deal
we could.

01:20:06.472 --> 01:20:09.209
I would certainly agree
with Ms. Gamble

01:20:09.242 --> 01:20:11.011
that this is a terrible day.

01:20:12.378 --> 01:20:13.446
For whatever reason,

01:20:13.479 --> 01:20:15.248
my daughter Allison,

01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:18.218
in a misguided effort
to protect her dad,

01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:19.620
tried to mislead the jury

01:20:19.653 --> 01:20:21.922
as to what happened that night.

01:20:21.955 --> 01:20:23.857
What did, in fact, happen

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:26.827
was exactly as I have
maintained.

01:20:28.461 --> 01:20:30.363
I thought my wife Marsha

01:20:30.396 --> 01:20:32.198
was under attack,

01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:34.500
and I was in fear for her life.

01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:38.004
I only accepted this plea
of manslaughter

01:20:38.038 --> 01:20:40.106
because my conscience
cannot permit

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.274
allowing my daughter

01:20:41.307 --> 01:20:44.144
to accept any culpability
for this act.

01:20:44.177 --> 01:20:45.679
Did I make a mistake?

01:20:45.712 --> 01:20:47.313
Absolutely...
FRUTT: That true, Marsha?

01:20:51.552 --> 01:20:54.120
You think you're helping
Allison?

01:20:54.154 --> 01:20:56.256
She's gonna end up
as another teenage suicide,

01:20:56.289 --> 01:20:58.525
and you know it.

01:20:58.559 --> 01:21:00.393
And if she is the shooter,

01:21:00.426 --> 01:21:04.097
I am going to eventually
prove it.

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:05.532
You represent her.

01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:06.667
FRUTT: As of now,

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.734
I don't.

01:21:07.768 --> 01:21:09.636
You're her lawyer.

01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:12.606
Not anymore.

01:21:12.639 --> 01:21:14.908
You really think
if Allison did this,

01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:16.142
I'd stay quiet?

01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:18.078
I don't know.

01:21:18.111 --> 01:21:19.546
You might not want
her life ruined

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.582
because of an affair you had.

01:21:22.816 --> 01:21:24.484
I never had an affair, Ellenor.

01:21:24.518 --> 01:21:26.119
Excuse me?

01:21:27.521 --> 01:21:30.624
I say this now,
client to attorney.

01:21:32.258 --> 01:21:34.427
The reason I told you
they'd never be able to prove

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.829
my affair with Jim McNoun

01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:38.599
is because it never happened.

01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:40.400
Jim McNoun had his affair

01:21:40.433 --> 01:21:41.968
with Keith.

01:21:43.604 --> 01:21:44.571
What?

01:21:44.605 --> 01:21:48.008
My husband is gay, Ellenor.

01:21:48.041 --> 01:21:49.810
And you know the old saying

01:21:49.843 --> 01:21:52.846
two things that'll kill
a political career

01:21:52.879 --> 01:21:54.848
being caught with a dead woman

01:21:54.881 --> 01:21:57.618
or a live boy.

01:21:57.651 --> 01:22:01.287
Keith and Jim McNoun
were in that bed that night.

01:22:01.321 --> 01:22:04.324
That's why they found
no semen on me.

01:22:04.357 --> 01:22:07.594
That's why they found
no powder burns on Keith.

01:22:07.628 --> 01:22:10.096
And since Helen Gamble
had to rule me out as a suspect

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:12.032
in order to do the rape kit,

01:22:12.065 --> 01:22:14.835
she couldn't trace metal
on my hands

01:22:14.868 --> 01:22:16.870
or test me for powder burns.

01:22:19.272 --> 01:22:20.406
You killed him?

01:22:23.309 --> 01:22:25.111
That information is sealed up

01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:27.514
in privilege, counselor.

01:22:27.548 --> 01:22:29.015
There's nothing you can do now

01:22:29.049 --> 01:22:31.718
but sit on it.

01:22:31.752 --> 01:22:33.253
So, at the party...

01:22:33.286 --> 01:22:36.690
I confronted Jim McNoun
with the affair,

01:22:36.723 --> 01:22:40.627
and when he said he wanted
to go public with it,

01:22:40.661 --> 01:22:42.696
that's when Keith
was overheard saying

01:22:42.729 --> 01:22:44.865
he wouldn't stand
to be humiliated.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.969
You all were so close.

01:22:50.771 --> 01:22:53.006
Spouse comes home
with daughter,

01:22:53.039 --> 01:22:55.041
finds spouse in bed
with another man,

01:22:55.075 --> 01:22:57.277
snaps, shoots.

01:22:59.379 --> 01:23:01.682
You just had the wrong
spouse in bed

01:23:03.216 --> 01:23:05.586
and the wrong one with the gun.

01:23:05.619 --> 01:23:07.754
KEITH: I made a mistake.

01:23:07.788 --> 01:23:11.024
I will now serve time
for that mistake,

01:23:11.057 --> 01:23:13.827
but I will come out
of this stronger.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.996
My commitment
to the Commonwealth

01:23:16.029 --> 01:23:18.431
of Massachusetts
shall never wane.

01:23:19.633 --> 01:23:21.201
I'll pay my debt

01:23:21.234 --> 01:23:24.504
to the society I vowed
to fight for,

01:23:24.538 --> 01:23:26.439
vowed to serve,

01:23:26.472 --> 01:23:28.575
and I'll be back to serve it.

01:23:29.876 --> 01:23:31.344
I felt your hearts with me

01:23:31.377 --> 01:23:33.113
during this trying time,

01:23:33.146 --> 01:23:36.449
and I won't forget
your unflinching support.

01:23:37.851 --> 01:23:39.586
And my heart...

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.921
will stay with you.

01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:45.592
And I will be back.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:04.678
(music playing)

01:24:27.934 --> 01:24:28.935
WOMAN: You stinker!
