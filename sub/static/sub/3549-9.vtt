WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.505
PORTER'S AFFAIR...

00:04.505 --> 00:07.438
YOUR SON LOVES ME,
AND I LOVE HIM.
 (grunting)

00:07.438 --> 00:09.780
...ESCALATED INTO VIOLENCE.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.443
HEY, WARREN.
 YEAH?

00:12.443 --> 00:16.146
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES.
YOU'RE DEAD.

00:16.146 --> 00:19.690
BUT THE FULL EXTENT
OF DAVE'S RAGE WAS REALIZED...

00:19.690 --> 00:21.292
FIRE!

00:21.292 --> 00:24.055
...DURING
THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS.

00:24.055 --> 00:28.028
UHH!
 (crowd screaming)

00:28.028 --> 00:29.660
MIKE!

00:29.660 --> 00:34.335
AND OUT OF THE TRAGEDY
CAME A HERO.

00:34.335 --> 00:38.069
HANG IN THERE.
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

00:43.644 --> 00:49.520
(Mary Alice) SOMETHING AWFUL
HAPPENED TO GABRIELLE SOLIS...

00:49.520 --> 00:52.183
AND SHE WAS REMINDED OF THIS

00:52.183 --> 00:56.157
EVERY TIME
SHE LOOKED IN A MIRROR...

00:56.157 --> 00:59.790
EVERY TIME SHE GLANCED
AT AN OLD PHOTO...

01:01.362 --> 01:05.366
AND EVERY TIME
SHE WALKED PAST A MAN.

01:07.768 --> 01:11.272
YES, GABRIELLE KNEW
SHE HAD LOST HER LOOKS.

01:11.272 --> 01:14.345
(elevator bell dings)

01:14.345 --> 01:20.211
BUT SHE TRIED HER BEST
TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

01:20.211 --> 01:25.156
AFTER ALL, WHAT WOMAN
NEEDS TO BE BEAUTIFUL...

01:25.156 --> 01:28.289
WHEN HER HUSBAND IS BLIND?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.691
HI, SWEETIE.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.193
HOW'S OUR PATIENT?

01:32.193 --> 01:35.526
WELL, HE TOOK A PRETTY NASTY
FALL IN THE FIRE LAST NIGHT.

01:35.526 --> 01:38.469
BUT, UH, THE C.T. SCAN
SHOWS NO BLEEDING OR SWELLING.

01:38.469 --> 01:39.830
THAT'S IT? NO CONCUSSION?

01:39.830 --> 01:42.373
ACTUALLY, THERE IS SOMETHING.

01:42.373 --> 01:44.375
PLEASE TELL ME
IT'S NOT MY HEARING.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.777
I'M ALREADY
DOWN TO FOUR SENSES.

01:46.777 --> 01:49.280
THE SCAN REVEALED
A TINY BONE FRAGMENT

01:49.280 --> 01:51.882
THAT MAY BE PUTTING PRESSURE
ON THE OPTIC NERVES.

01:51.882 --> 01:54.585
AND, WHAT, YOU'RE AFRAID
IT'S GONNA IMPAIR HIS VISION?

01:54.585 --> 01:58.449
(laughs)

01:58.449 --> 02:01.222
I'M SORRY. YOU WERE SAYING?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.524
THE BONE FRAGMENT
MIGHT BE A REMNANT

02:03.524 --> 02:05.696
FROM YOUR INJURY
FIVE YEARS AGO.

02:05.696 --> 02:07.698
DUE TO ITS SMALL SIZE,

02:07.698 --> 02:10.201
THE ORIGINAL SCAN
MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT.

02:10.201 --> 02:13.664
MM, FIVE YEARS.
CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE IT?
 ACTUALLY, THERE IS A CHANCE

02:13.664 --> 02:16.907
IF WE REMOVE THAT BONE FRAGMENT,
YOU COULD REGAIN YOUR SIGHT.

02:16.907 --> 02:18.609
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:18.609 --> 02:19.810
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

02:19.810 --> 02:21.812
I'M NOT PROMISING
A SLAM DUNK HERE.

02:21.812 --> 02:23.644
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S POSSIBLE.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.647
DOC, TWO DAYS AGO, I SPREAD
MOISTURIZER ON A CRACKER.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.880
I'D KILL FOR "POSSIBLE."
 I'VE SPOKEN WITH TED DANIELS.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.882
HE'S THE BEST EYE SURGEON
IN THE STATE.

02:31.882 --> 02:35.656
HE SAYS HE COULD FIT YOU IN
FOR SURGERY IN ABOUT A MONTH.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.228
(gasps) OH!
 OH, MY GOD.

02:37.228 --> 02:39.830
IF THIS WORKS,
I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE

02:39.830 --> 02:42.663
TO SEE MY LITTLE GIRLS
AND MY GORGEOUS WIFE.
 OH. (chuckles)

02:42.663 --> 02:45.165
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!
THANK YOU.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.368
DOCTOR,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 AH!

02:47.368 --> 02:51.802
YES, GABRIELLE SOLIS
KNEW SHE HAD LOST HER BEAUTY.

02:51.802 --> 02:54.405
SHE ALSO KNEW

02:54.405 --> 03:08.188
THE TIME HAD COME
TO GET IT BACK.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.962
THERE WAS A FIRE
IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW,

03:11.962 --> 03:13.964
AND THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INJURED

03:13.964 --> 03:17.568
CAME TO RECOVER
AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

03:17.568 --> 03:19.800
BY MORNING,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.872
THEIR BURNS HAD BEEN
BANDAGED...

03:21.872 --> 03:25.776
THEIR BROKEN BONES
HAD BEEN SET...

03:25.776 --> 03:29.380
AND THEIR WOUNDS
HAD BEGUN HEALING.

03:29.380 --> 03:34.885
YES, EVERYONE WAS WELL
ON THEIR WAY TO RECOVERY...

03:34.885 --> 03:39.320
EXCEPT FOR THE MAN
WHO HAD STARTED THE FIRE.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.322
YOU SEE, HIS SUFFERING

03:41.322 --> 03:43.694
WAS JUST BEGINNING.

03:44.895 --> 03:46.427
SORRY.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.260
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
 ARE YOU DAVE WILLIAMS?

03:49.260 --> 03:51.502
YEAH.
 I'M DETECTIVE COLLINS.
THIS IS DETECTIVE LYONS.

03:51.502 --> 03:52.963
YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

03:52.963 --> 03:54.735
WHY?

03:54.735 --> 03:58.369
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE FIRE AT THE WHITE HORSE BAR.

04:00.641 --> 04:04.014
WE'VE BEEN INTERVIEWING EVERYONE
WHO WAS THERE LAST NIGHT.

04:04.014 --> 04:06.917
WE WERE TOLD BY AN...
ORSON HODGE

04:06.917 --> 04:09.620
THAT YOU WERE
ONSTAGE WITH THE BAND

04:09.620 --> 04:11.622
WHEN THE FIRE BROKE OUT.

04:11.622 --> 04:14.385
YEAH. WE HAD
JUST STARTED WHEN...

04:14.385 --> 04:17.387
SUDDENLY THE CURTAINS
WENT UP.

04:17.387 --> 04:20.029
EVERYTHING HAPPENED
REALLY FAST AFTER THAT.

04:20.029 --> 04:23.534
THAT'S OKAY. WE KNOW HOW HARD
THIS HAS GOT TO BE.

04:23.534 --> 04:26.897
SO... HAVE THEY FIGURED OUT
HOW THE FIRE STARTED?

04:26.897 --> 04:28.939
WE KNOW IT WAS ARSON.

04:28.939 --> 04:31.702
REALLY?
 IT'S LOOKING LIKE
THE POINT OF ORIGIN

04:31.702 --> 04:33.804
WAS THE STORAGE ROOM
OFF THE BACK HALLWAY.

04:33.804 --> 04:36.006
AND THERE WAS
A BODY IN THERE, TOO.

04:36.006 --> 04:40.050
AND YOU THINK THAT'S THE PERSON
WHO STARTED THE FIRE?
 NO, WE DON'T THINK SO.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.483
BUT THIS GUY
WAS PRETTY BADLY BURNED,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.485
SO IT'LL TAKE US A WHILE
TO IDENTIFY HIM.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.487
ANYWAY, IF YOU, UH,

04:46.487 --> 04:48.989
REMEMBER ANYTHING
YOU THINK WE SHOULD KNOW,

04:48.989 --> 04:51.562
GIVE A CALL AT
THAT NUMBER THERE. ALL RIGHT?

04:51.562 --> 04:52.563
MM.

04:52.563 --> 04:55.025
DAVE WILLIAMS...

04:55.025 --> 04:58.729
AREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO WENT BACK
IN AND SAVED THAT DELFINO GUY?

04:58.729 --> 05:00.431
YEAH.

05:00.431 --> 05:02.433
YOU'RE AN HONEST TO GOD HERO.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.005
YOU SHOULD BE REAL PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.913
IF YOU SAY SO.

05:16.086 --> 05:17.718
(chuckles)

05:17.718 --> 05:20.721
I WOULD'VE COME SOONER,
BUT I BURNT THE FIRST BATCH,

05:20.721 --> 05:23.023
AND I WASN'T SURE
YOU'D APPRECIATE THE IRONY.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.827
I'M SO HUNGRY,
I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.329
HEY, CAN I GET A KISS
FROM MY COOKIE?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.562
MIKE!

05:31.562 --> 05:34.705
WHAT IF SOMEONE SEES US?
 WHAT IF THEY DO?

05:36.106 --> 05:38.969
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD SUSAN
WE'RE DATING YET.

05:38.969 --> 05:42.573
I'M WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

05:42.573 --> 05:44.575
HER FRIENDSHIP'S
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

05:44.575 --> 05:47.077
AND I WANT
TO EASE HER INTO THIS.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.880
OKAY.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.423
I GET IT.

05:52.423 --> 05:54.054
SEE YA.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.886
JUST WALK OUT SLOWLY.

05:55.886 --> 05:57.888
GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO LIVE FOR.

05:57.888 --> 06:00.391
(laughs)

06:03.834 --> 06:05.365
(gasps) SUSAN.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.537
HI!
 HI!

06:06.537 --> 06:07.968
HOW'S JACKSON?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.471
UH, HE'S FINE,
JUST GETTING SOME STITCHES.
 OH.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.942
HOW'S...

06:11.942 --> 06:13.944
WAIT, WHO ARE YOU
HERE TO SEE?

06:13.944 --> 06:16.977
YOU KNOW...

06:16.977 --> 06:18.509
EVERYBODY.

06:18.509 --> 06:20.511
SO MANY PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

06:20.511 --> 06:22.513
WERE HURT IN THE FIRE.

06:22.513 --> 06:25.516
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE
TO BRING THEM... GIFTS.

06:25.516 --> 06:27.518
OH. CRAP! I DIDN'T
GET ANYONE GIFTS. (chuckles)

06:27.518 --> 06:29.560
BUT I DID GIVE BLOOD,

06:29.560 --> 06:33.063
SO I'LL JUST REMIND EVERYBODY
THAT I DID THAT. (chuckles)

06:35.165 --> 06:38.068
HOW YOU FEELING?
I JUST GAVE BLOOD.

06:38.068 --> 06:39.570
(chuckles)

06:39.570 --> 06:42.172
UH, I'M FINE, JUST A LITTLE
SMOKE INHALATION.

06:42.172 --> 06:44.034
HOW'S JACKSON DOING?

06:44.034 --> 06:46.577
OH, FINE. HE JUST NEEDS
SOME STITCHES.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.579
OOH, THOSE COOKIES
LOOK DELICIOUS.

06:48.579 --> 06:50.781
WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM?

06:52.182 --> 06:53.884
UM... A FRIEND.

06:53.884 --> 06:55.185
HAVE ONE.

06:55.185 --> 06:58.589
OH, I SHOULDN'T.
THEY'RE YOURS.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.551
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.753
WELL, I DID JUST GIVE BLOOD.

07:02.753 --> 07:04.054
(chuckles)

07:04.054 --> 07:05.756
OH!

07:07.057 --> 07:08.629
ATTRACTIVE.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.901
MM, I HATE MACADAMIA NUTS.

07:10.901 --> 07:12.903
YOU THINK THEY'RE
WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS

07:12.903 --> 07:15.806
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.
STUPID HAWAII.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.808
WHO MADE 'EM?

07:17.808 --> 07:19.910
UM... LIKE I SAID,
A FRIEND.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.042
YEAH. BUT WHAT FRIEND?

07:25.916 --> 07:28.719
WAIT.
IS THIS A WOMAN FRIEND?

07:28.719 --> 07:32.082
UM, DON'T YOU WANNA THROW
THAT MACADAMIA NUT AWAY?

07:32.082 --> 07:34.655
WHEN I'M DONE.
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE?

07:36.657 --> 07:37.958
WHY DO YOU CARE?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.661
I CARE BECAUSE
YOU MEAN A LOT TO ME,

07:40.661 --> 07:42.663
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD

07:42.663 --> 07:44.795
KNOWING THAT TWO PEOPLE
HAVE FOUND LOVE AND HAPPINESS.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.797
SO WHAT'S HER NAME?
WHO AM I HAPPY FOR?

07:46.797 --> 07:49.840
SUSAN, I'M NOT TELLING YOU.
 WHY NOT?

07:49.840 --> 07:52.773
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO TELL YOU HERSELF.

07:54.745 --> 07:58.509
SO... I KNOW HER?

07:58.509 --> 08:00.911
WHOA, I THINK
MY MEDS JUST KICKED IN.

08:00.911 --> 08:03.984
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
 YOU'RE DATING
A FRIEND OF MINE?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.216
(sighs) DON'T BE ANGRY,

08:06.216 --> 08:10.090
I'M NOT, BUT NOW YOU HAVE
TO TELL ME WHO SHE IS.

08:12.763 --> 08:13.924
FINE.

08:13.924 --> 08:16.026
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

08:16.026 --> 08:19.029
OH, IF HE EVER NEEDS
A TRANSFUSION,

08:19.029 --> 08:22.603
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO GIVE HIM MY BLOOD.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.738
HELLO, DR. COMINIS.
HOW'S MY HUSBAND DOING?

08:27.738 --> 08:30.040
WELL, THE X-RAYS INDICATE
THERE WAS NO CONCUSSION,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.643
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA
RELEASE HIM TODAY.

08:32.643 --> 08:34.144
WONDERFUL.
 (chuckles)

08:34.144 --> 08:36.647
THE HOUSE WAS TOO QUIET
WITHOUT HIM.
 MM.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.751
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
TO TALK TO HIM.

08:41.751 --> 08:44.054
HE'S BEEN IN A LOT OF PAIN,

08:44.054 --> 08:46.927
SO WE GAVE HIM SOMETHING
TO HELP HIM SLEEP.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.929
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I CAN WAIT.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.931
MMM, HE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.603
(snores loudly)
 (gasps) GOODNESS.

08:52.603 --> 08:55.535
I'M SURE IF ORSON WERE AWAKE,
HE'D APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
 (chuckles)

08:55.535 --> 08:57.537
(snores loudly)

08:57.537 --> 08:59.009
HAS HE ALWAYS SNORED?

08:59.009 --> 09:01.271
OCCASIONALLY,
BUT NEVER QUITE THIS--

09:01.271 --> 09:03.744
(snores loudly)

09:03.744 --> 09:05.946
ROBUSTLY.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.679
WELL, THE INJURY TO HIS SEPTUM
MIGHT'VE MADE IT WORSE.

09:08.679 --> 09:11.221
BUT IT CAN BE CORRECTED WITH
A SIMPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.624
(snores loudly)

09:13.624 --> 09:17.087
WELL, IF IT'S SO SIMPLE,
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

09:17.087 --> 09:19.329
IT'LL TAKE A FEW WEEKS
TO SCHEDULE.

09:19.329 --> 09:22.332
SO... SOON AS HE WAKES UP,
YOU CAN TAKE HIM HOME.

09:22.332 --> 09:26.667
(snores loudly)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.168
WELL... (chuckles)

09:28.168 --> 09:31.171
AT LEAST THE HOUSE
WON'T BE QUIET ANYMORE.
 (chuckles)

09:31.171 --> 09:34.775
(snores loudly)

09:34.775 --> 09:37.778
(woman speaks indistinctly
over PA)

09:37.778 --> 09:40.180
(indistinct conversations)

09:40.180 --> 09:42.813
HEY. I RAN INTO KATHERINE.

09:42.813 --> 09:45.115
SHE SAID YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME ABOUT SOMETHING.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.618
RIGHT. WHAT WAS IT?

09:47.618 --> 09:50.160
OH, YEAH.
THANKS FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.963
YEAH, WELL...

09:52.963 --> 09:55.265
WE ALL DID
WHAT WE HAD TO DO, RIGHT?

09:55.265 --> 09:57.968
AND YOU WENT BACK IN
FOR JACKSON.

09:57.968 --> 10:00.801
YEAH, BUT I ENDED UP
PASSED OUT ON THE FLOOR,

10:00.801 --> 10:03.634
WHICH, TECHNICALLY, MAKES ME
AN IDIOT AND YOU A HERO.

10:03.634 --> 10:07.607
YEAH, PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THAT.
I DON'T... FEEL LIKE ONE.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.311
WELL, I WOULD'VE
BEEN DEAD WITHOUT YOU.

10:11.311 --> 10:15.846
SO... HOW ABOUT FREE PLUMBING
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

10:15.846 --> 10:18.318
THAT SOUNDS FAIR. (chuckles)

10:20.120 --> 10:22.192
SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE, UH,

10:22.192 --> 10:25.055
YOU GOTTA LET ME
DO SOMETHING TO THANK YOU.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.632
WELL, EVER SINCE MY BROTHER
DIED, I HAVEN'T HAD A...

10:32.632 --> 10:35.305
REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.868
THINK YOU COULD
HANDLE THAT JOB?

10:37.868 --> 10:40.140
I THINK I COULD.

10:51.121 --> 10:54.124
THE STITCHES ARE IN. I'LL NEED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS.

10:54.124 --> 10:56.356
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME PILLS
FOR THE PAIN?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.789
NAH, STITCHES NEVER BOTHER ME.
I'LL BE FINE.

10:58.789 --> 11:02.332
GREAT. THEN LET ME GET ANOTHER
BANDAGE, AND WE'LL BE DONE.
 THANK YOU.

11:02.332 --> 11:05.065
MR. AND MRS. SCAVO?

11:05.065 --> 11:08.068
CAN WE ASK YOU A FEW FOLLOW-UP
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FIRE?

11:08.068 --> 11:11.842
WE ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WE CAN REMEMBER.
 THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.673
IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
THAT THE OWNER OF THE CLUB
AND YOUR SON

11:15.675 --> 11:18.678
GOT INTO A FIGHT MINUTES
BEFORE THE FIRE BROKE OUT.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.212
NOW DID YOU WITNESS THAT?
 I SAW A GROWN MAN BEATING UP
ON MY TEENAGE BOY.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.214
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

11:24.214 --> 11:26.086
DURING THE ALTERCATION,

11:26.086 --> 11:29.890
DID YOUR SON
THREATEN TO KILL MR. SCHILLING?

11:32.422 --> 11:33.964
NO.

11:33.964 --> 11:35.325
REALLY?

11:35.325 --> 11:37.127
WELL...

11:37.127 --> 11:41.201
I WAS RIGHT THERE, DETECTIVE.
MY SON SAID NO SUCH THING.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.103
YOU SURE?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.836
ABSOLUTELY.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.243
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

11:55.385 --> 11:58.088
MAYBE I'M BEING
A LITTLE PARANOID HERE,

11:58.088 --> 12:00.450
BUT I SORT OF
GOT THE FEELING

12:00.450 --> 12:03.854
THAT YOU WERE
LYING TO THE POLICE.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.856
(sighs) LYNETTE, PLEASE,

12:05.856 --> 12:10.100
TELL ME THAT PORTER DID NOT
THREATEN TO KILL MR. SCHILLING.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.302
GOT THE BANDAGE.

12:12.302 --> 12:14.304
YOU MIGHT WANNA GO AHEAD

12:14.304 --> 12:17.007
AND GIVE HIM
THOSE PAIN PILLS, DOC.

12:17.007 --> 12:19.409
HE'S GONNA NEED 'EM.

12:27.317 --> 12:30.981
(sighs deeply and sniffles)

12:30.981 --> 12:32.282
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:32.282 --> 12:36.056
CARLOS MIGHT GET HIS SIGHT BACK.
YOU SHOULD BE THRILLED.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.058
(voice breaks) OH, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

12:38.058 --> 12:40.360
HE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
THESE PAST FIVE YEARS,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.062
AND HE'S NEVER COMPLAINED.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.034
I JUST THINK HE DESERVES
TO OPEN HIS EYES

12:44.034 --> 12:47.297
TO A WIFE WHO DOESN'T
TUCK HER BOOBS INTO HER PANTS.

12:47.297 --> 12:50.500
OH, GABY, PLEASE. MOST WOMEN
WOULD KILL TO LOOK LIKE YOU.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.502
BUT I'M NOT MOST WOMEN.

12:52.502 --> 12:54.504
I WAS AN INTERNATIONAL
FASHION MODEL,

12:54.504 --> 12:57.507
AND THAT'S
HOW CARLOS REMEMBERS ME.
 YOU ARE STILL BEAUTIFUL.

12:57.507 --> 13:00.881
SO YOU'VE GAINED
A LITTLE WEIGHT. WHO HASN'T?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.312
(sighs)

13:02.312 --> 13:05.015
DON'T GO BY ME.
I HAVE A WEIRD METABOLISM.

13:05.015 --> 13:07.217
(footsteps approaching)
 HEY THERE!

13:07.217 --> 13:09.820
I JUST HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
ABOUT CARLOS!

13:11.261 --> 13:14.064
OH. WHAT'S WRONG?

13:14.064 --> 13:17.067
GABY THINKS THAT CARLOS ISN'T
GONNA FIND HER ATTRACTIVE

13:17.067 --> 13:19.069
AFTER HE GETS
HIS SIGHT BACK.

13:19.069 --> 13:22.072
YEAH, THAT WAS
MY FIRST THOUGHT, TOO.
 EDIE!

13:22.072 --> 13:25.075
WELL...
 OH, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
LET HER TALK.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.277
AT LEAST SHE'S BEING HONEST.

13:27.277 --> 13:30.280
(voice breaks) IT'S THE KIND OF
SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP

13:30.280 --> 13:32.282
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

13:32.282 --> 13:34.384
FINE. YOU'RE A PIG.

13:34.384 --> 13:37.247
THANK YOU.

13:37.247 --> 13:40.050
GOD, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
(cries)

13:40.050 --> 13:43.193
WELL... YOU'RE GONNA
STOP WHINING, FOR ONE.

13:43.193 --> 13:45.195
YOU GOT A MONTH, RIGHT?

13:45.195 --> 13:47.527
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME TO GO ON
A DIET AND START EXERCISING.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.230
BY THE TIME CARLOS
GETS HIS EYESIGHT BACK,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.402
YOU ARE GONNA
BE LOOKING HOT...

13:52.402 --> 13:54.564
OR HOT-ISH.

13:54.564 --> 13:58.268
REALLY? I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
I COULD PULL THIS OFF?

13:58.268 --> 13:59.569
OF COURSE,

13:59.569 --> 14:02.842
EVEN THOUGH I STILL THINK YOU'RE
BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.275
YOU GONNA
START THAT CRAP AGAIN?

14:07.417 --> 14:10.180
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.983
TOM, I WAS 6 FEET AWAY.

14:12.983 --> 14:15.285
PORTER LOOKED WARREN SCHILLING
IN THE EYE AND SAID,

14:15.285 --> 14:18.288
"YOU'RE DEAD. I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT TAKES. YOU'RE DEAD."

14:18.288 --> 14:20.630
THAT DOESN'T PROVE A THING.

14:20.630 --> 14:23.133
AND--AND--AND I'M SURE
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.634
MAYBE HE DIDN'T.

14:24.634 --> 14:28.168
BUT TEN MINUTES LATER,
THAT NIGHTCLUB WAS ON FIRE.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.940
NO. NO!

14:29.940 --> 14:31.401
I KNOW PORTER.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.104
HE WOULDN'T COMMIT ARSON
JUST TO GET BACK AT SOMEONE.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.575
WHAT ABOUT
RICK'S RESTAURANT?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.978
PORTER AND HIS BROTHER
BURNED THAT DOWN.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.981
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.283
I MEAN, THEY--THEY WERE
TRYING TO PROTECT US.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.156
THEY--THEY--NOBODY GOT HURT.
THE BUILDING WAS EMPTY.

14:46.156 --> 14:49.889
YES, THAT TIME,
THE BUILDING WAS EMPTY.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.095
THIS IS INSANE.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.496
(sighs)

14:56.496 --> 14:59.529
LYNETTE, ARE YOU
ACTUALLY TELLING ME

14:59.529 --> 15:01.601
THAT OUR SON IS A MURDERER?

15:04.434 --> 15:08.378
I'M TELLING YOU I HEARD HIM
THREATEN WARREN SCHILLING.

15:08.378 --> 15:11.181
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.249
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SAW HIM?

15:19.249 --> 15:22.352
WHAT IF
HE LEFT BEHIND EVIDENCE?

15:22.352 --> 15:24.354
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

15:24.354 --> 15:27.227
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT
OUR SON.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.960
EVEN IF
HE KILLED SIX PEOPLE?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.504
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT
OUR SON.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.139
OKAY.

15:42.712 --> 15:45.275
OH, BOY!

15:45.275 --> 15:49.149
WHO KNEW HEALTHY FOOD
COULD LOOK SO TASTY?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.151
OKAY, DIG IN.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.524
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:54.524 --> 15:58.258
IT SMELLS LIKE THE BEACH THAT
TIME THEY WOULDN'T LET US SWIM.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.191
IT'S A RECIPE
I GOT FROM A DIET MAGAZINE.

16:01.191 --> 16:04.664
IT'S--IT'S FISH AND BROCCOLI.
 FISH?

16:04.664 --> 16:08.968
YES. NOT ALL FISH
IS SHAPED LIKE A STICK.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.202
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE NOT USED
TO IT, BUT GIVE IT A TRY.

16:12.202 --> 16:14.204
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

16:19.449 --> 16:22.312
(flatly) MMM. YUMMY.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.454
IT'S STILL IN YOUR MOUTH.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.461
SEE? DELICIOUS!

16:31.461 --> 16:33.763
I WANT MACARONI.

16:33.763 --> 16:35.765
HEY, I'M NOT
A SHORT-ORDER COOK.

16:35.765 --> 16:39.329
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE
DIFFERENT MEALS FOR EVERYONE.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.671
IT COMES IN A BOX.
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

16:41.671 --> 16:45.405
OKAY, LOOK. MOMMY NEEDS
TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS,

16:45.405 --> 16:48.408
AND IT'S NOT EASY EATING HEALTHY
WITH YOU TWO IN FRONT OF ME,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.410
SCARFING DOWN
ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.443
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU WANT TO
HELP MOMMY BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN?

16:56.286 --> 16:58.348
NO.

16:58.348 --> 17:02.052
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE. PART OF
THE REASON I'M ON THIS DIET IS

17:02.052 --> 17:04.594
BECAUSE CARRYING YOU 2 BRATS
FOR 18 MONTHS MADE MOMMY FAT!

17:04.594 --> 17:08.228
AND YOU WITH THE HEAD--
YOU RUINED ME!

17:08.228 --> 17:10.230
SO THIS IS HOW
IT'S GONNA GO DOWN.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.031
YOU'RE GONNA EAT FISH WITH MOMMY
AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.164
GOT IT?

17:14.164 --> 17:15.464
THANK YOU.

17:17.707 --> 17:20.210
(man on TV) A SPOKESMAN
FROM FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

17:20.210 --> 17:22.712
SAYS THIS LATEST DEATH
RAISES THE TOTAL TO SEVEN.

17:22.712 --> 17:24.714
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE WATCHING THAT AGAIN?
 (siren wailing)

17:24.714 --> 17:26.476
(clears throat)
 AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE

17:26.476 --> 17:29.449
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
AS MANY AS 100--
 (mutes TV)

17:29.449 --> 17:32.552
HEY.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.155
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.357
I JUST...

17:37.357 --> 17:41.060
THIS FIRE--I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE IT REALLY HAPPENED.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.365
I MEAN, THEY JUST SAID ANOTHER
PERSON DIED THIS AFTERNOON.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.737
THAT MAKES... SEVEN.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.373
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

17:53.373 --> 17:57.147
THEY THINK THEY KNOW
WHO DID IT.

17:57.147 --> 17:58.448
WHO?

17:58.448 --> 18:00.510
WELL, IT'S JUST A RUMOR,

18:00.510 --> 18:04.284
BUT I HEAR THEY'RE LOOKING
AT PORTER SCAVO.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.186
PORTER?

18:06.186 --> 18:08.318
WHY WOULD THEY THINK
IT'S HIM?

18:08.318 --> 18:10.820
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS THERE WAS A FIGHT

18:10.820 --> 18:13.823
BETWEEN HIM AND THE GUY
WHO OWNS THE CLUB.

18:13.823 --> 18:16.826
YOU KNOW, I'VE KNOWN THAT KID
SINCE HE WAS 6 YEARS OLD,

18:16.826 --> 18:19.329
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS TROUBLE.

18:19.329 --> 18:22.332
AND TRUST ME, I'M A REALLY GOOD
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

18:38.488 --> 18:41.891
YOU SLEPT ON THE COUCH?
WHY? IT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

18:41.891 --> 18:43.393
YES, IT IS.

18:43.393 --> 18:46.396
SIT DOWN. WE NEED TO TALK.

18:46.396 --> 18:47.897
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:47.897 --> 18:49.759
ORSON, DEAR,

18:49.759 --> 18:52.762
BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOUR NOSE
WAS BROKEN DURING THE FIRE,

18:52.762 --> 18:54.864
YOU NOW SNORE.

18:54.864 --> 18:57.237
OH, DIDN'T I SNORE BEFORE?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.538
GOOD POINT.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.611
SNORING IS TOO MILD A WORD
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:01.611 --> 19:06.246
IMAGINE A TERRIFIED ELEPHANT
SUMMONING HIS HERD.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.348
YOU KNOW, BREE,

19:08.348 --> 19:11.421
I CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE ISSUE
WITH YOUR SARCASTIC TONE.

19:11.421 --> 19:14.254
SNORING IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I CAN HELP.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.925
NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

19:15.925 --> 19:19.389
THE DOCTOR SAID THERE'S
A VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE--

19:19.389 --> 19:20.730
PROCEDURE?

19:20.730 --> 19:23.393
VERY ROUTINE AND--
AND PRACTICALLY OUTPATIENT.

19:23.393 --> 19:26.236
YOU MEAN SURGERY? NO WAY.

19:26.236 --> 19:29.239
I HAD AN UNCLE WHO DIED DURING
AN "OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE."

19:29.239 --> 19:32.242
HE WENT IN FOR A BROKEN WRIST.
THEY PUT HIM UNDER.

19:32.242 --> 19:34.244
HE NEVER WOKE UP.

19:34.244 --> 19:37.307
YOU DON'T HAVE AN UNCLE!

19:37.307 --> 19:39.609
FINE. HE WAS MORE
OF A FAMILY FRIEND.

19:39.609 --> 19:42.312
NO, THE POINT IS,
HE'S STILL DEAD,

19:42.312 --> 19:44.614
AND I AM NOT HAVING
UNNECESSARY SURGERY.

19:44.614 --> 19:46.286
THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.788
I AM GOING THROUGH
A VERY STRESSFUL TIME.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.562
I HAVE INTERVIEWS, THAT COOKING
DEMONSTRATION AT THE MALL.

19:52.562 --> 19:55.565
IF I DON'T GET MY REST, IT COULD
AFFECT THE LAUNCH OF MY BOOK.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.567
OH! WELL,
THAT'S VERY REASONABLE.

19:57.567 --> 20:00.270
YOU GET TO BE
A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.372
I GET TO BE
AN ORGAN DONOR.

20:02.372 --> 20:04.874
ORSON, IF WE CAN'T
SHARE A BED,

20:04.874 --> 20:07.707
IT'S GOING TO HURT
THE INTIMACY OF OUR MARRIAGE.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.580
MY DEATH WILL HAVE
THE SAME EFFECT.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.946
OH, ORSON,

20:16.946 --> 20:21.251
I CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE ISSUE
WITH YOUR SARCASTIC TONE.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.727
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

20:29.759 --> 20:32.332
I HEAR YOU'RE
GETTING DISCHARGED TODAY.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.334
ARE YOU GOING BACK HOME?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.905
HOME?

20:35.905 --> 20:37.567
HMM, LET'S SEE...

20:37.567 --> 20:40.370
TWO CRACKED RIBS,
BLACK EYE...

20:40.370 --> 20:43.343
NOPE, GOT EVERYTHING I NEED
FROM THERE.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.577
I'M SURE YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE NIGHTCLUB BURNING DOWN.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.479
YEAH, I HEARD.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.951
YOUR HUSBAND'S
BLAMING PORTER.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.354
WHAT?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.856
PORTER WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

21:02.732 --> 21:04.564
WHAT'S THIS?

21:04.564 --> 21:07.337
I'M HELPING YOU HELP ME.

21:08.638 --> 21:11.341
THIS WAY, YOU GET
TO START A NEW LIFE,

21:11.341 --> 21:13.843
AND I GET
TO NOT HAVE YOU AROUND

21:13.843 --> 21:16.746
WHILE MY SON
IS GOING THROUGH ALL THIS.

21:16.746 --> 21:19.549
WHAT IF
I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE?

21:19.549 --> 21:22.051
WELL, THEN YOU CAN FACE
STATUTORY RAPE CHARGES

21:22.051 --> 21:24.384
WITHOUT THE MONEY.
YOUR CALL.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.621
(gasps)

21:31.621 --> 21:33.623
I'LL PICK YOU UP TONIGHT.

21:33.623 --> 21:36.326
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE
TO THE BUS STATION.

21:36.326 --> 21:38.398
YOU CAN COUNT IT THEN.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.479
HEY, DO YOU WANNA
TAKE A WALK?

21:49.479 --> 21:51.981
I NEED
A LITTLE GIRLFRIEND TIME.

21:51.981 --> 21:55.515
I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN THE OVEN,
BUT YOU CAN COME IN IF YOU WANT.

22:03.353 --> 22:06.095
SO... WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

22:06.095 --> 22:07.557
WELL... (sighs)

22:07.557 --> 22:09.429
IT'S ABOUT MIKE.

22:11.361 --> 22:12.532
MIKE?

22:12.532 --> 22:14.033
YEAH. (sighs)

22:14.033 --> 22:16.536
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW UPSET I WAS

22:16.536 --> 22:19.038
WHEN I DISCOVERED
HE'S DATING A FRIEND OF MINE?

22:19.038 --> 22:21.441
OH, SUSAN, I'M SO--

22:21.441 --> 22:24.374
IT'S GOTTA BE LISA WALLACE.

22:24.374 --> 22:26.716
SO SHOCKED AT LISA!

22:26.716 --> 22:28.378
HOW DARE SHE?!

22:28.378 --> 22:31.381
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS WANTED TO GET
HER HOOKS INTO MIKE FOR YEARS.

22:31.381 --> 22:34.384
EVERY TIME SHE WOULD
HAVE US OVER FOR A BARBECUE,

22:34.384 --> 22:36.986
SHE ALWAYS WORE
SOMETHING BOOBY.

22:36.986 --> 22:39.489
(scoffs)
WELL, IN LISA'S DEFENSE,

22:39.489 --> 22:41.491
MAYBE SHE THINKS
YOU'RE OVER MIKE,

22:41.491 --> 22:44.494
WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE HEARD
YOU SAY MORE THAN ONCE.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.636
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:46.636 --> 22:48.097
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

22:48.097 --> 22:50.940
SHE SHOULD'VE COME TO ME
AND DISCUSSED IT FIRST.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.072
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
ALWAYS AVAILABLE.

22:53.072 --> 22:57.907
AND BESIDES... MAYBE LISA
WAS WAITING TO SEE

22:57.907 --> 23:00.480
IF THIS THING HAD A FUTURE.
(chuckles)

23:00.480 --> 23:02.482
ALL THINGS WE CAN DISCUSS

23:02.482 --> 23:05.485
WHEN I KNOCK HER TEETH OUT
WITH A POOL CUE.
 (chuckles nervously)

23:05.485 --> 23:08.418
YOU KNOW, IT'S SAD
WHEN YOU CAN'T TRUST A FRIEND.

23:08.418 --> 23:10.720
(mouth full)
OR MAYBE THE LESSON HERE

23:10.720 --> 23:13.723
IS THAT SHE WASN'T REALLY
A FRIEND TO BEGIN WITH THEN.

23:16.165 --> 23:18.097
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:24.133 --> 23:26.836
SUSAN, I SWEAR
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

23:26.836 --> 23:30.139
IT'S FINE. IT'S... FINE.
 I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE SUCH A BIG DEAL.

23:30.139 --> 23:33.142
I MEAN,
YOU'RE SEEING JACKSON NOW.
 YES, I AM.
YOU'RE PERFECTLY RIGHT.

23:33.142 --> 23:35.845
AND I'VE BEEN
SO LONELY LATELY.
 WELL, NOW YOU'RE NOT.

23:35.845 --> 23:37.847
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

23:37.847 --> 23:40.149
WOULD YOU JUST PLEASE
YELL AT ME OR SOMETHING?
 (sighs)

23:40.149 --> 23:42.151
OH, DAMN IT. I SHOULD'VE
LISTENED TO BREE.
 BREE?

23:42.151 --> 23:45.154
YES. SHE TOLD ME WEEKS AGO
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

23:45.154 --> 23:46.656
SO BREE KNEW?
 YES.

23:46.656 --> 23:49.499
OKAY.
WELL, HAVE A NICE DAY.

23:49.499 --> 23:51.931
SO... WE'RE OKAY THEN?

23:55.465 --> 23:58.067
YOU KNEW
ABOUT KATHERINE AND MIKE?

23:58.067 --> 24:01.671
OH, GOD, SUSAN. CAN'T THIS WAIT
TILL AFTER MY NAP?
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

24:01.671 --> 24:04.173
(sighs) I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS MY PLACE.

24:04.173 --> 24:06.716
I THOUGHT KATHERINE
SHOULD TELL YOU.

24:06.716 --> 24:09.719
WELL, SHE DIDN'T.
 I'M SORRY.

24:09.719 --> 24:12.051
UH, NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.224
Y-YOU HAD A MILLION CHANCES
TO SAY SOMETHING AND YOU DIDN'T.

24:15.224 --> 24:19.088
THAT IS JUST THE SAME
AS LYING TO MY FACE.

24:19.088 --> 24:21.090
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT

24:21.090 --> 24:24.093
THAT THE ONE THING I COULD
DEPEND ON YOU FOR WAS HONESTY.

24:24.093 --> 24:25.765
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?

24:25.765 --> 24:28.768
YOU WANT HONESTY? FINE.
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DIVORCE MIKE.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.470
YOU HIT A REALLY BAD PATCH
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

24:31.470 --> 24:33.472
BUT YOU NEVER STOPPED
LOVING HIM.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.774
AND WHY WOULD YOU?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.146
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
DIDN'T HAVE A NATURAL END.

24:37.146 --> 24:40.149
SO FACE IT. YOU'RE NOT MAD
AT ME OR MIKE OR KATHERINE.

24:40.149 --> 24:41.811
YOU'RE MAD AT YOURSELF

24:41.811 --> 24:43.813
FOR LETTING YOUR MARRIAGE
FALL APART.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.260
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

24:54.624 --> 24:58.267
EITHER TELL MIKE HOW YOU FEEL
OR MOVE ON,

24:58.267 --> 25:00.269
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO DO,

25:00.269 --> 25:02.131
AND IT'S NOT FAIR
TO STOP HIM.

25:04.073 --> 25:08.177
YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION,
SUSAN.

25:08.177 --> 25:11.140
AND I NEED TO GET BACK
TO MY NAP. (sighs)

25:13.643 --> 25:15.244
(door closes)

25:23.853 --> 25:26.856
I KNOW THE DOCTOR TOLD US
NOT TO GET OUR HOPES UP...

25:26.856 --> 25:28.157
(Gabrielle) UH-HUH.

25:28.157 --> 25:31.160
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT. MY HOPES
ARE UP. I AM GONNA SEE AGAIN!

25:31.160 --> 25:34.163
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
 I KNEW IT. YOU'RE EXCITED, TOO.
I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE.

25:34.163 --> 25:36.305
HI, DR. BACH! HOW ARE YOU?
 HI, MRS. SOLIS.

25:36.305 --> 25:39.569
HEY, DOC! WE ARE STILL
REELING OVER THE GOOD NEWS.

25:39.569 --> 25:41.571
WELL, I HAVE EVEN BETTER NEWS.

25:41.571 --> 25:43.573
DR. DANIELS
JUST HAD A CANCELLATION.

25:43.573 --> 25:46.075
HE CAN FIT YOU IN NEXT FRIDAY.

25:46.075 --> 25:49.078
FRIDAY?! BUT YOU SAID
IT WOULD BE AT LEAST A MONTH.

25:49.078 --> 25:52.051
I MEAN, THAT'S SO SOON.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.923
SO? FRIDAY'S GREAT.

25:55.284 --> 25:58.257
OKAY, I DIDN'T WANNA
HAVE TO SAY THIS,

25:58.257 --> 26:00.259
BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER
HAVE SURGERY ON A FRIDAY.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.832
THE SURGEONS ARE THINKING
ABOUT THE WEEKEND.

26:02.832 --> 26:04.293
THEY'RE ALL DISTRACTED.

26:04.293 --> 26:07.296
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU COME
OUT OF THE O.R. STILL BLIND

26:07.296 --> 26:09.298
AND MISSING YOUR RIGHT LEG.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.300
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
LIKE THIS?

26:11.300 --> 26:13.302
ALSO, THE SURGERY
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

26:13.302 --> 26:16.305
WE NEED TIME TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.577
HOW ABOUT USING
OUR INSURANCE?

26:18.577 --> 26:21.651
THAT ONLY COVERS 85%.
AND WE ARE BROKE.

26:21.651 --> 26:24.153
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE HOSPITAL HAS A FOUNDATION

26:24.153 --> 26:26.285
TO HELP PEOPLE
IN THIS EXACT SITUATION.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.988
NO.
WE DON'T ACCEPT CHARITY.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.661
WHAT?
WE ALWAYS ACCEPT CHARITY!

26:31.661 --> 26:33.663
WELL, I HAVE TURNED OVER
A NEW LEAF.

26:33.663 --> 26:37.026
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE TIMING,
CARLOS, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

26:37.026 --> 26:40.029
GABY, WE ARE DOING THIS FRIDAY.
NOW DROP IT.

26:40.029 --> 26:41.871
(sighs)

26:41.871 --> 26:44.173
SO YOU SAY THIS GUY'S GOOD,
HUH, DOC?

26:44.173 --> 26:47.637
DR. DANIELS IS ONE OF
THE TOP GUYS IN THE COUNTRY.

26:47.637 --> 26:52.682
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
 (exhales deeply)

26:52.682 --> 26:55.815
BREE... (sighs)
 PLEASE LET ME SLEEP IN MY BED.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.186
NO.

26:57.186 --> 26:59.188
I PROMISE NOT TO SNORE.

26:59.188 --> 27:00.950
AND--AND IF I DO,

27:00.950 --> 27:04.153
I WILL GO DOWN TO THE SOFA
AND STAY AS LONG AS YOU SAY.

27:04.153 --> 27:06.726
AND HOW EXACTLY
ARE YOU GONNA STOP SNORING?

27:06.726 --> 27:11.300
WELL, I READ SOMEWHERE THAT
CHAMOMILE TEA HELPS PREVENT IT.
 THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.233
WELL, IT'S WORTH A TRY,
RIGHT?

27:14.233 --> 27:17.166
LOOK, I'LL--
I'LL BREW YOU A CUP, TOO.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.038
WHATEVER.

27:24.213 --> 27:25.915
OOH.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.690
THERE YOU GO.
DRINK THAT UP.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.693
ALL RIGHT, BUT I THINK
I'LL BE TOO TIRED TO FINISH IT.

27:43.693 --> 27:46.065
THAT PILL I TOOK
REALLY KICKED IN FAST.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.237
YOU TOOK A PILL?
WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

27:48.237 --> 27:49.939
WHEN YOU WERE DOWNSTAIRS.

27:49.939 --> 27:52.942
UH, OH, WELL,
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T DRINK THIS,

27:52.942 --> 27:55.004
BECAUSE THE CHAMOMILE
ACTUALLY, UH,

27:55.004 --> 27:57.676
COUNTERACTS THE EFFECT
OF THE SLEEPING PILL.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.409
SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BECOME
SUCH AN EXPERT ON CHAMOMILE?

28:00.409 --> 28:03.112
WELL, THE POINT IS,
WE SHOULDN'T RISK IT.

28:03.112 --> 28:05.414
FINE. I JUST KNOW
I NEED MY SLEEP TONIGHT.

28:05.414 --> 28:09.688
(mutters) HMM. MM.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.260
(singsong voice) THAT'S IT.

28:11.260 --> 28:13.963
WE'LL FINISH THAT THOUGHT
TOMORROW.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.804
(shifts car gears)

28:24.804 --> 28:27.837
(turns off engine)

28:27.837 --> 28:29.839
I, UM, DON'T SUPPOSE

28:29.839 --> 28:32.481
YOU'D TELL PORTER
SOMETHING FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

28:37.316 --> 28:40.750
I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO HEAR,

28:40.750 --> 28:43.092
BUT... I DO LOVE YOUR SON.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.296
HE WAS VERY SWEET TO ME.

28:47.296 --> 28:51.831
KINDNESS HAS ALWAYS...

28:51.831 --> 28:53.833
BEEN A WEAKNESS OF MINE.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.136
GOOD LUCK.

29:09.118 --> 29:11.520
ANNE?
 (shuts car door)

29:11.520 --> 29:14.884
WHEN THE BABY COMES,
YOU DON'T CONTACT PORTER.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.886
YOU CAN CONTACT TOM OR ME,

29:16.886 --> 29:20.930
AND WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN FOR YOU
FROM A DISTANCE.

29:20.930 --> 29:22.231
UNDERSTOOD?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.966
THERE'S NO BABY.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.968
NEVER WAS.

29:46.415 --> 29:47.887
(ring)

29:47.887 --> 29:48.988
(beep)

29:48.988 --> 29:50.389
HELLO?

29:50.389 --> 29:53.422
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE LADY
AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE.

29:53.422 --> 29:54.793
She said that Mom's late.
 LATE FOR WHAT?

29:54.793 --> 29:57.066
FOR THE COOKING DEMONSTRATION.

29:57.066 --> 29:58.327
THAT'S TODAY?

29:58.327 --> 30:01.901
Yeah. It was supposed
to start ten minutes ago.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.904
LOOK, I'M IN MT. PLEASANT
RIGHT NOW BUYING SOME END TABLES

30:04.904 --> 30:06.405
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET HER THERE.
 (click)

30:06.405 --> 30:10.139
Orson?

30:10.139 --> 30:12.441
BREE, HONEY? WAKE UP.

30:12.441 --> 30:14.383
IT'S 9:15.
 9:15?

30:14.383 --> 30:17.386
HUH?
 9:15. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THE MALL.

30:17.386 --> 30:19.388
DID I FORGET TO SET
THE ALARM?

30:19.388 --> 30:22.421
WE NEED TO GET DRESSED.
I'LL GET YOU SOME CLOTHES.
 I'M SO THIRSTY.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.423
WELL, I'LL BRING YOU
SOME JUICE.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.956
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL JUST DRINK THIS TEA.

30:26.956 --> 30:29.128
BREE.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.260
(sighs) WHAT?

30:31.260 --> 30:34.033
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
YOU NEED COFFEE.

30:36.605 --> 30:38.607
ALMOST THERE.
ALL RIGHT, COFFEE TIME.

30:38.607 --> 30:41.240
ENOUGH COFFEE.
IT'S NOT WORKING, ANYWAY.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.413
IT MUST BE DECAF.
 NO, IT'S A TRIPLE ESPRESSO.

30:44.413 --> 30:48.247
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I FEEL SO LOOPY.
 HMM. VERY MYSTERIOUS.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.580
LOOK, BREE, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS WHIP UP A FEW PANCAKES,

30:51.580 --> 30:54.283
HAND OUT SOME ADVANCE COPIES
OF YOUR BOOK,

30:54.283 --> 30:57.456
AND WE'RE OUTTA HERE. DO YOU
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

30:57.456 --> 30:58.958
OF COURSE I CAN.

30:58.958 --> 31:02.031
YOU ARE SUCH
A NERVOUS NELLIE, REX.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.435
OH, AND HERE'S THE LADY
WHO'S GONNA TEACH US

31:06.435 --> 31:08.437
HOW TO MAKE HER TRADITIONAL
BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES--

31:08.437 --> 31:11.400
BREE VAN DE KAMP.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.474
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.478
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
TO YOUR LOVELY HOME.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.181
(chuckles nervously)
BREE, UM, YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT

31:22.181 --> 31:24.653
SO MUCH MORE THAN
JUST RECIPES, ISN'T IT?

31:24.653 --> 31:28.117
YES, MY BOOK IS ABOUT FOOD
AND FAMILIES

31:28.117 --> 31:32.321
AND HOW FOOD BRINGS FAMILIES
TOGETHER WHEN THEY MAKE FOOD.

31:32.321 --> 31:35.424
(chuckles) IT'S MOTHERS
TEACHING DAUGHTERS HOW TO COOK.

31:35.424 --> 31:39.298
SO I'M GONNA COOK PANCAKES
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

31:39.298 --> 31:44.173
ONLY SHE'S NOT HERE 'CAUSE
SHE GREW UP AND STOLE MY BABY.

31:44.173 --> 31:48.007
SO... WHO WANTS TO BE
MY DAUGHTER?

31:53.012 --> 31:56.485
(beeping)

31:56.485 --> 31:58.287
(cell phone rings)

31:58.287 --> 32:01.951
(ring)

32:01.951 --> 32:03.322
HELLO?

32:03.322 --> 32:08.157
IT'S ME. I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU...

32:08.157 --> 32:11.460
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND, UM,

32:11.460 --> 32:13.502
I'M OKAY WITH YOU
DATING MIKE.

32:13.502 --> 32:16.365
YOU ARE?
YOU DON'T HATE ME?

32:16.365 --> 32:20.209
NO...
AND I THINK IT'S GREAT.

32:20.209 --> 32:22.511
OH, SUSAN, THANK YOU.
I WAS SO WORRIED.

32:22.511 --> 32:24.213
I JUST... (sighs)

32:24.213 --> 32:27.416
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF I LOST YOU AS A FRIEND.

32:27.416 --> 32:30.679
OH. (chuckles nervously)
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T.

32:30.679 --> 32:33.352
JUST... TREAT HIM WELL,
OKAY?

32:33.352 --> 32:35.354
HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

32:35.354 --> 32:39.358
I WILL. HEY, UM, I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO MAKE A CAPPUCCINO.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.130
YOU WANNA COME OVER?

32:41.130 --> 32:44.563
UH... NO, THANKS.

32:44.563 --> 32:49.398
I'M REALLY BUSY. I HAVE
A LOT OF THINGS TO DO TODAY.

32:49.398 --> 32:52.301
ANOTHER TIME THOUGH, OKAY?
(chuckles nervously)

32:52.301 --> 32:54.073
BYE.

33:00.749 --> 33:02.151
(sighs)

33:02.151 --> 33:05.154
JUST CALL ME BACK, OKAY?

33:05.154 --> 33:07.386
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

33:10.359 --> 33:11.660
(beep)
 WHO'S THAT?

33:11.660 --> 33:15.664
NOBODY. JUST A KID AT SCHOOL.
I LENT HIM MY BUS PASS.

33:15.664 --> 33:18.427
OH.

33:18.427 --> 33:21.400
LISTEN, WE NEED TO TALK.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.501
WHAT'S UP?

33:26.375 --> 33:29.278
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

33:29.278 --> 33:33.042
AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

33:33.042 --> 33:34.613
OKAY.

33:36.745 --> 33:39.448
DID YOU SET THAT FIRE
AT THE NIGHTCLUB?

33:41.690 --> 33:44.323
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
LET ME SAY

33:44.323 --> 33:46.425
THAT IF YOU DID,

33:46.425 --> 33:49.398
I PROMISE, YOUR FATHER AND I
WILL STAND BEHIND YOU

33:49.398 --> 33:52.531
AND TRY AND FIND SOME WAY
OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.304
BUT IF YOU LIE TO ME,

33:55.304 --> 34:00.239
AND I FIND OUT LATER
THAT YOU... KILLED...

34:00.239 --> 34:02.111
THOSE PEOPLE...

34:02.111 --> 34:04.613
WELL, I WILL LOVE YOU.
THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE,

34:04.613 --> 34:08.417
BUT I WON'T BELIEVE IN YOU
ANYMORE,

34:08.417 --> 34:12.581
AND IF I...
DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU...

34:12.581 --> 34:15.384
(voice breaking)
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

34:17.456 --> 34:21.730
WE HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER
THE TRUTH

34:21.730 --> 34:23.562
FROM HERE ON OUT.

34:25.534 --> 34:29.538
MOM... I DON'T KNOW
WHO SET THE FIRE,

34:29.538 --> 34:31.100
BUT IT WASN'T ME.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.503
(sighs)

34:36.304 --> 34:40.449
OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
OF COURSE.

34:40.449 --> 34:43.181
THEN WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY,

34:43.181 --> 34:45.714
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
TELLING THE TRUTH.

34:45.714 --> 34:49.518
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

34:51.590 --> 34:56.395
MOM? THERE IS ONE THING
I LIED ABOUT.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.096
WHAT?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.398
WHEN YOU WALKED IN,

34:59.398 --> 35:02.301
I WAS LEAVING A MESSAGE
FOR ANNE.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.832
OH.

35:03.832 --> 35:05.834
SHE HASN'T RETURNED
MY CALLS,

35:05.834 --> 35:08.507
AND THE HOSPITAL SAID
SHE CHECKED OUT.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.879
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE IS?

35:13.642 --> 35:17.516
NO. SWEETIE, I DON'T.

35:23.552 --> 35:26.395
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT?

35:26.395 --> 35:28.227
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.529
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AGAIN

35:30.529 --> 35:32.231
AND HOLIDAY DECORATIONS.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.802
MAN, I REALLY MISS
THAT STUFF.

35:33.802 --> 35:37.135
YEAH, WELL, LET'S KEEP
OUR FINGERS CROSSED.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.637
OW!

35:38.637 --> 35:41.139
YOU OKAY?

35:41.139 --> 35:44.473
YEAH. IT'S MY HAMSTRING.
I'VE JUST BEEN WORKING OUT.

35:44.473 --> 35:47.516
YOU WANT ME TO RUB IT?

35:47.516 --> 35:48.817
NO, NO, YOU REST.

35:48.817 --> 35:51.380
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SURGERY
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.323
I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT.

35:54.323 --> 35:56.625
YOU KNOW, CARLOS,
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED

35:56.625 --> 35:59.528
TO SEE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
AGAIN,

35:59.528 --> 36:05.163
BUT... I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE PREPARED BECAUSE...

36:05.163 --> 36:08.467
WELL, SOME OF THOSE LIGHTS
MAY HAVE LOST THEIR LUSTER.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.770
SO SHOULD WE BUY
NEW DECORATIONS?

36:11.770 --> 36:15.744
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.
I MAY HAVE LOST MY LUSTER.

36:15.744 --> 36:17.446
(chuckles) COME ON.

36:17.446 --> 36:20.579
I'M ALWAYS GONNA FIND YOU
BEAUTIFUL. I TOLD YOU THAT.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.452
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA BE BLIND FOREVER.

36:23.452 --> 36:25.414
BUT IF THIS OPERATION WORKS,

36:25.414 --> 36:27.916
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

36:27.916 --> 36:31.860
(moaning)

36:31.860 --> 36:33.662
OH, COME HERE.

36:36.725 --> 36:39.728
(moaning)

36:41.570 --> 36:44.903
DID I EVER TELL YOU WHEN
I KNEW I WAS GONNA MARRY YOU?

36:44.903 --> 36:46.905
FIRST TIME YOU SAW ME
ON THE RUNWAY.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.908
NO, THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
I WAS GONNA SLEEP WITH YOU.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.411
(chuckles) NO, I KNEW
I WAS GONNA MARRY YOU

36:52.411 --> 36:56.415
THE NIGHT WE WENT TO THAT
RESTAURANT ON THIRD STREET.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.417
MMM, I REMEMBER THAT PLACE.

36:58.417 --> 37:02.291
MM-HMM. YOU WORE
A WHITE LINEN SUNDRESS.

37:02.291 --> 37:08.427
(chuckles) AND YOU ORDERED
THIS GIANT PLATE OF RIBS.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.429
AND YOU ATE THEM
WITH SUCH GUSTO,

37:10.429 --> 37:12.731
UP TO YOUR ELBOWS
IN BARBECUE SAUCE,

37:12.731 --> 37:14.733
MEAT HANGING
FROM YOUR TEETH

37:14.733 --> 37:17.806
AND GREASE IN YOUR HAIR.

37:17.806 --> 37:19.808
AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER,

37:19.808 --> 37:23.442
I POINTED OUT WHAT A MESS
YOU WERE.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.414
WELL, YOU PULLED OUT
YOUR MIRROR,

37:25.414 --> 37:28.447
TOOK A LOOK AT YOURSELF
AND JUST LET OUT

37:28.447 --> 37:33.722
THIS HUGE, HAPPY,
TOTALLY UNRESTRAINED LAUGH.

37:36.024 --> 37:39.758
THE ROOM COMPLETELY
FILLED WITH IT...

37:39.758 --> 37:42.591
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
NOW THAT IS A SOUND

37:42.591 --> 37:45.464
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.940
THAT'S WHY I PROPOSED
TO YOU,

37:51.940 --> 37:54.943
AND IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR LOOKS.

38:01.780 --> 38:06.415
YOU KNOW WHEN I DECIDED I WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU FOREVER?

38:06.415 --> 38:08.757
NO. WHEN?

38:08.757 --> 38:10.819
(whispers)
ABOUT TWO SECONDS AGO.

38:16.925 --> 38:19.428
UP UNTIL THEN,
IT WAS PRETTY TOUCH-AND-GO.

38:32.841 --> 38:34.843
SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

38:34.843 --> 38:38.487
WELL, MY HUSBAND HAS AGREED
TO THE PROCEDURE YOU SUGGESTED.

38:38.487 --> 38:41.089
OH, THE ONE TO ALLEVIATE
HIS SNORING?
 YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

38:41.089 --> 38:43.592
SO ANYTIME
YOU WANNA GET IN THERE

38:43.592 --> 38:45.894
AND START HACKING AWAY,
HE'S READY FOR YOU.

38:45.894 --> 38:48.827
AREN'T YOU, LOVE?
 YES, DEAR.

38:50.499 --> 38:54.002
WELL, HOW IS TWO WEEKS
FROM FRIDAY?

38:54.002 --> 38:56.505
WELL, FRIDAYS ARE WHEN
ORSON PLAYS GOLF.

38:56.505 --> 38:59.938
SO FRIDAY'S PERFECT.
RIGHT, ORSON?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.970
RIGHT... DEAR.

39:04.112 --> 39:05.614
I'M SORRY, MR. HODGE.

39:05.614 --> 39:09.878
I'M SENSING YOU'RE A BIT
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE SURGERY.

39:09.878 --> 39:12.581
OH, HE'S NOT APPREHENSIVE.
HE'S TERRIFIED.

39:12.581 --> 39:15.484
AND I DON'T CARE,
BECAUSE HE OWES ME ONE--

39:15.484 --> 39:16.955
A BIG ONE.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.487
DON'T YOU, DARLING?

39:18.487 --> 39:20.789
I SURE DO.

39:23.131 --> 39:25.434
I'M SORRY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

39:25.434 --> 39:27.536
ARE YOU MARRIED,
DR. COMINIS?

39:27.536 --> 39:30.439
NO, BUT I JUST MOVED IN
WITH SOMEONE.

39:30.439 --> 39:32.441
WELL, OVER TIME, YOU'LL LEARN

39:32.441 --> 39:34.743
THAT THERE'S A BALANCE OF POWER
IN RELATIONSHIPS,

39:34.743 --> 39:37.746
AND IF YOUR BELOVED
EVER PULLS A NASTY TRICK ON YOU,

39:37.746 --> 39:39.748
LIKE SAY,
DRUGGING YOU INTO A STUPOR,

39:39.748 --> 39:42.451
THEN THE BALANCE OF POWER
SHIFTS TO YOU,

39:42.451 --> 39:44.753
AND THEN YOU CAN DEMAND
THEY PROVE THEIR LOVE

39:44.753 --> 39:47.486
BY, SAY, UNDERGOING SURGERY.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.087
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.690
NOT REALLY.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.593
YOU WILL.
COME ALONG, ORSON.

40:11.980 --> 40:14.513
HEY, HON, LISTEN,
CAN YOU PROMISE ME SOMETHING?

40:14.513 --> 40:17.516
TELL ME WE'LL NEVER GROW INTO
ONE OF THOSE INSANE COUPLES

40:17.516 --> 40:20.018
THAT JUST LIVES
TO MAKE EACH OTHER CRAZY.

40:20.018 --> 40:24.923
WELL, NO WORRIES THERE.
YOU ALREADY MAKE ME CRAZY.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.625
OH, HEY, GUESS WHAT?

40:26.625 --> 40:29.528
I, UH, I PICKED UP
OUR NEW END TABLES TODAY.

40:29.528 --> 40:33.131
YEAH, HURRY HOME.
I WANT YOU TO SEE 'EM.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.503
(laughs)

40:37.005 --> 40:40.839
IF YOU WALK THROUGH
FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,

40:40.839 --> 40:43.972
YOU WILL ENCOUNTER
ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE

40:43.972 --> 40:47.516
DOING THEIR BEST TO RECOVER.

40:49.518 --> 40:52.481
IT MIGHT BE A HUSBAND

40:52.481 --> 40:56.454
LICKING HIS WOUNDS
AFTER A MARITAL BATTLE...

40:58.657 --> 41:03.662
OR TWO PARENTS RALLYING
FROM AN ATTACK OF DOUBT.

41:06.164 --> 41:11.500
IT MIGHT BE A WIFE WHO'S BEEN
CURED OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM...

41:14.503 --> 41:17.506
OR A PAIR OF LOVERS
WHO FIND HONESTY

41:17.506 --> 41:20.048
TO BE THE BEST MEDICINE.

41:22.010 --> 41:27.556
SADLY, YOU WILL ALSO FIND
SOME POOR SOULS AFFLICTED

41:27.556 --> 41:31.159
WITH A CONDITION
THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM.

41:31.159 --> 41:33.922
DETECTIVES, I HEARD
YOU WERE STILL HERE,

41:33.922 --> 41:36.665
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE,
AND I HAVE...

41:36.665 --> 41:38.266
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

41:38.266 --> 41:39.928
OKAY.

41:39.928 --> 41:41.930
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE...

41:41.930 --> 41:45.073
I WAS BACK
BY THE STORAGE ROOM.

41:45.073 --> 41:46.504
YES?

41:48.837 --> 41:52.010
AND I SAW SOMEBODY
COME OUT--

41:52.010 --> 41:55.013
A KID WHO LIVES ON MY BLOCK.
HIS NAME IS PORTER SCAVO.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.016
YOU ASKED ME TO TELL YOU
IF I REMEMBERED ANYTHING,

41:58.016 --> 42:00.889
AND... I REMEMBERED THAT.
