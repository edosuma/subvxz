00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
[panting]

00:20.103 --> 00:22.105
[Doug]
You worried about the regionals?

00:22.605 --> 00:25.400
I know Clayton Prep has that one speedy
Mexican girl,

00:25.483 --> 00:26.693
but I know you could beat her.

00:28.486 --> 00:31.448
Are you offended I called her Mexican?
'Cause she actually is.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.365
I kissed a boy.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.744
Wow.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.203
That's something.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.207
Yeah, I wasn't gonna tell you,
but you're kind of my go-to,

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
which makes me feel like a loser.

00:43.084 --> 00:46.463
Wow. That's your first kiss, huh?

00:46.546 --> 00:47.714
That's...

00:47.797 --> 00:49.299
That's a big deal.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.801
-Oh, God, you're being weird.
-I'm not being weird.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.138
You are. You're running away from me,
moving your arms weird.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.307
No, I'm not. I'm just gangly.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.059
It's how I run.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.394
Wait a second. Hold on a second.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.812
[breathing heavily]

01:03.480 --> 01:05.523
[stammering] Who is this boy?

01:05.607 --> 01:08.109
What school does he go to?
What do you guys do together?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.778
How tall is he?

01:09.861 --> 01:12.489
His name is Evan,
and he goes to tech school.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.366
And we mostly just hang out
at Kennedy Park.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.079
-And he's coming over to do homework.
-Homework?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.539
What kind of homework do they give
at the tech school?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.958
-Can he fix our AC?
-Can we stop talking about this?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.210
Casey?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.046
Casey, wait up!

01:37.180 --> 01:39.390
[Sam]  Whoever said
"Practice makes perfect"

01:39.474 --> 01:40.558
was an idiot.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.522
Humans can't be perfect,
because we're not machines.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.234
Unfortunately, the best thing
that you can say about practice

01:49.317 --> 01:52.112
is that it makes... better.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.199
Which is why I know that in order
to be a good boyfriend to Julia,

01:57.158 --> 01:58.993
I need a practice girlfriend first.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.622
You get good at something
when you do it repeatedly...

02:05.041 --> 02:06.876
when you get into a routine.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.216
[timer ticking]

02:58.970 --> 03:00.221
[timer dings]

03:12.901 --> 03:15.486
[exhales] Casey.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.823
Why does my to-do list say
"Remove stick from butt!"?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.158
I don't know.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.285
But if it's on there,
you got to do it, right?

03:22.368 --> 03:25.204
You guys need fuel after your run?
I made cinnamon buns.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.331
No, no, no, no, no.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.375
-I got all the sugar I need right here.
-[gags]

03:29.459 --> 03:32.378
Did you know there are 432 girls
at our school

03:32.462 --> 03:35.715
and 91 of them have a name
that starts with an M,

03:35.798 --> 03:37.717
which is 21%,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.762
and the national average is only... 9%?

03:40.845 --> 03:42.680
I 100% don't care.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.516
-Boop!
-Cool fact, buddy.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.561
I'm going to the mall later.
Does anybody need anything?

03:50.647 --> 03:54.067
"No, Mom,
but thanks for everything you do."

03:56.986 --> 03:58.238
[exhales]

04:09.207 --> 04:12.752
[Sam]  In second grade,
Madison Gold gave me a valentine

04:12.835 --> 04:14.837
with a picture of a western honeybee on it

04:14.921 --> 04:18.049
that said "Bee mine." B-e-e.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.261
I didn't understand why
the word "be" was misspelled,

04:21.344 --> 04:24.138
but she was nice and explained it to me.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.225
That's the first joke I ever learned.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.730
Hey, Madison.  Bee  mine.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.233
Um... what?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.443
Would you like to go on a date?

04:39.570 --> 04:41.197
That's so nice, but I'm busy.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.199
Okay.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.748
Wait. I didn't tell you when the date is.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.750
Friday, 6:00 p.m., Eastern.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.960
I'm still busy.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.211
Okay.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.884
I also forgot to tell you
that you would be my practice girlfriend.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.430
The person I really like is Julia,
my therapist, if that makes it better.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.432
It makes it worse.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.184
If Friday is bad,
I could do Thursday instead.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.061
My God! I don't want to go out with you.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.063
-Why not?
-Because...

05:15.064 --> 05:18.985
Look, no offense at all...
at all, at all...

05:19.068 --> 05:21.321
but... you're really weird.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.323
And you wear the same clothes every day.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.492
I also have this guy from camp
that I haven't seen in a while,

05:26.576 --> 05:28.328
but we text all the time...

05:28.411 --> 05:30.496
[continues indistinctly]

05:33.583 --> 05:34.751
I need new clothes.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.128
Okay. How come?

05:37.795 --> 05:42.008
Girls seem to like it when boys wear
more than one type of shirt. Why is that?

05:42.842 --> 05:46.304
I guess to get a sense of your style.
It says something about a person.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.224
Like how some iguanas flare their colorful
dewlaps to attract a mate.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.435
Exactly... like that.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.270
I think.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.148
How do you currently
pick out your clothes?

05:57.815 --> 06:01.194
I don't. My mom does.
Doesn't your mom pick out your clothes?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.528
[chuckles] Not anymore.

06:04.530 --> 06:08.034
I think maybe it's time
to start picking out your own clothes.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.704
But... how?

06:11.788 --> 06:13.748
There are so many clothes.

06:13.831 --> 06:18.503
And different colors
and patterns and sizes.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.963
This shirt is called "fog gray,"

06:21.047 --> 06:24.133
but fog isn't even a color...
it's translucent.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.095
Just pick something
that feels like you.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.389
Once you live on your own,
you'll need to choose your own clothes.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.142
You can do this, Sam.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.019
There's a stylish dude in there.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.939
You mean me, right?

06:38.731 --> 06:39.774
I do.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.946
[Doug]
All right, you're doing great.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.614
So, Casey has a boyfriend.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.157
[man scoffs] Uh-oh.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.035
Oh, no. It's okay.
Casey's got a good head on her shoulders.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.621
Just breathe normally, ma'am.
You're doing great.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.082
She told me about it,
so that's a good thing, right?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.959
I'm sure I got nothing to worry about.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.294
That's the same thing I said
about my daughter.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.130
It's fun being a grandfather.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.422
You'll like it.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.865
[chuckles]

07:31.701 --> 07:33.369
Mom, I want to go shopping with you.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.537
What?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.664
You're going to the mall.
I want to come.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.875
I love spending time with you.
You know that.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.294
But it's easier
if I go to the mall by myself.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.797
But Julia says I need to learn how
to do my own shopping

07:44.881 --> 07:46.424
for when I live by myself one day.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.552
Well, that's fine,
and that's good for Julia to say,

07:49.635 --> 07:52.638
but she wasn't with us
the last time we went to the mall.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.348
It was so overwhelming,

07:54.432 --> 07:57.101
with all the sounds and the lights

07:57.185 --> 07:59.437
and, God, that awful fountain

07:59.520 --> 08:01.272
with the water going every which way.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.482
I hated that fountain.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.566
Yeah, you did.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.318
And you ended up getting upset,

08:05.401 --> 08:07.320
and do you remember what happened?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.990
I slapped the nice man
at Panda Express,

08:11.073 --> 08:12.617
and then we got banned forever.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.785
And we love their Kung Pao chicken.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.121
But...

08:17.914 --> 08:19.123
Julia thinks I'm ready.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.124
How about this?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.251
How about if I see anything that's cute,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.378
I'll take a picture on my phone
and send it to you,

08:24.462 --> 08:26.339
and then you can shop
from the comfort of home?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.090
Pretty great idea, right?

08:28.716 --> 08:29.634
No.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.720
Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.680
I can go shopping.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.932
I can do things.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.643
Of course you can.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.562
All right.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.273
I'll finish up here, and we'll go, okay?

08:45.858 --> 08:47.902
You want to help me put away
the groceries?

08:47.985 --> 08:48.945
No.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.909
[Evan] Wow, I have never seen
a less photogenic family.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.577
Yeah, we pride ourselves on that.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.371
-Can we be done now?
-No, no, no.

08:58.454 --> 09:02.166
Oh, look at you in this one.
Look at you scowling!

09:02.250 --> 09:03.626
Yeah, I was annoyed.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.045
My mom plans this autism walk every year,

09:06.128 --> 09:08.839
and makes us take a picture
to remember how sweaty we are.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.007
Oh, man.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.467
These are great.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.760
[laughs]

09:14.136 --> 09:16.472
Hey, where's your dad in this one?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.559
That's weird. My mom never lets us skip.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.353
When I had appendicitis,
she told me to walk it off.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.734
[keys jingle]

09:30.611 --> 09:31.571
[door closes]

09:33.114 --> 09:33.948
Dad.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.533
This is... Evan.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.035
Hey. It's nice to meet you, sir.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.287
Thanks for stopping by.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.628
Dad, why weren't you
at the autism walk in 2004?

09:47.712 --> 09:48.546
Huh?

09:49.213 --> 09:51.632
-You're not in the picture.
-Oh. I don't know.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.135
I think I had a work thing.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.262
Really? Mom let you skip it
for a work thing?

09:56.345 --> 09:57.597
Yeah.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.849
So, you guys all done studying?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.100
Is Evan ready to go?

10:01.183 --> 10:04.562
-No, he's gonna take me to track practice.
-I can take you.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.272
Well, I don't need you to. He is.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.816
-Oh, Evan drives? You drive?
-Yes.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.484
-How's your record?
-Clean.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.778
-Parking tickets? Traffic violations?
-Mnh-mnh.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.572
-Parole? None of that?
-No.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.781
-He stole a tuba.
-Casey.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.950
What's that mean, "tuba"?
What's that, slang?

10:18.034 --> 10:20.620
[chuckles nervously]
We should probably get going.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.122
-Maybe you should get going.
-Dad!

10:24.123 --> 10:25.374
Can we have a second?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.043
-Yeah. I'll be in the car.
-Yeah.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.089
-What the hell?
-I say that to you.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.635
What are you doing? Coming home early.
All up in my face. Acting like Mom.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.928
You know, I love your mom,
but that's a low blow.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.223
Okay, I just--
You know, I get worried about you.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.643
I don't want you distracted.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.561
I don't want you
to screw up your track career.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.146
I'm not. Track is important to me.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.273
-Is it?
-Yeah. Stop acting like a lunatic.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.901
We're gonna talk about
that tuba thing later, too.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.962
Okay.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.672
-Thanks for the ride.
-Yeah.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.467
We could've walked here faster.
You drive like my nana.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.344
Have you seen my car?

11:18.427 --> 11:20.971
If I drive too fast, pieces fall off.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.390
[chuckles]

11:23.432 --> 11:26.143
So... that was weird
with your dad, right?

11:27.144 --> 11:28.854
Yeah. He's just being stupid.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.774
That's the way dads are
with boys their daughters are dating.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.025
No, I get that.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.653
I mean, him lying about
missing the autism walk.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.615
-Why do you think that he's lying?
-[chuckles] Because he was.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.200
I mean, it was obvious.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.786
"Casey, I... I had a work thing."

11:43.869 --> 11:45.204
You know?

11:45.287 --> 11:46.497
You don't even know my dad.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.960
Maybe not, but I've got a lot
of experience with lying fathers.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.586
And mothers.

11:53.087 --> 11:53.963
And uncles.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.424
Even my dog pretends he has to go out
when he doesn't.

11:56.507 --> 12:00.136
All right, well, I'm sorry about your dad,
but my dad wouldn't lie.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.305
That's not the way he is. He's the only
one in my family that gets me.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.100
And honestly,
if he's acting a little aggro...

12:06.809 --> 12:09.520
it's probably because
I told him about our kiss.

12:09.603 --> 12:10.521
Hmm.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.982
You told your dad that we kissed. Okay.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.569
Yeah. See, that's exactly my point.
We're honest with each other.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.571
Good. That's good.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.409
He didn't lie.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955

12:29.540 --> 12:31.584
[sighs] The light is so harsh in here.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.127
It's like...

12:33.210 --> 12:35.379
-Do you want your sunglasses?
-No.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.547
[beeping continues]

12:36.630 --> 12:39.508
Boop! Boop! Boop!
Does that sound annoying?

12:39.592 --> 12:42.344
-When you make it.
-Do you want your headphones?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.637
No. I'm fine.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.932
Okay. Great. Okay.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.976
Well, we'll just grab a few things

12:49.059 --> 12:51.020
and make this...
[snaps fingers] short and sweet.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.980
Oh, it's gonna be sweet, all right.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.316
Zahid. You're here.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.275
Zahid's here.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.695
I invited Zahid, because he's
the most stylish person I know.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.238
Sometimes he wears two watches.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.699
I think I'm also quite stylish.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.368
Bring it in, Mrs. G.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.288
Mm. Nice.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.082
Long hug. Okay. Thank you.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.501
You smell amazing.

13:13.584 --> 13:17.296
Um... hey, Sam.
This would look very handsome on you.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.506
You're such a winter.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.466
Julia says I need to pick my own clothes.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.718
Well, screw Julia.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.554
-Ooh!
-I'm sorry.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.514
Um...

13:27.598 --> 13:29.099
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.851
I get it, Mama. She bugs.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.603
I once worked with a guy like that.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.938
Really irked me.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.315
-So you know what I did?
-No.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.526
I put my butt on his car.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.860
Excuse me?

13:39.944 --> 13:42.530
I went outside to the parking lot
while he was working,

13:42.613 --> 13:43.822
pulled down my drawers,

13:43.906 --> 13:45.950
and plopped my nut-brown bottom
on his car.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.537
And what did that do?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.205
[laughs]

13:51.288 --> 13:52.248
Nothing.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.708
But now I'll always know
that my butt was on his car,

13:54.792 --> 13:56.252
and he has no idea.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.254
It's the ultimate power.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.172
Okay.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.800
-Sam, let's get you into a dressing room.
-[knock on door]

14:02.883 --> 14:05.177
-[baby crying]
-Oh, no, no, no.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.304
This is all wrong.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.682
I called. I was very clear
about what we needed.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.517
Okay, I'm gonna go find somebody.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.685
I can just go in here.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.979
No, sweetie. I'll be back in two shakes.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.065
Let's get rid of this Mr. Rogers shit
your mom picked out.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.525
Party shirts first, bro.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
Hi. Excuse me... Dolores.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.239
My name is Elsa Gardner.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.992
I think I spoke to you
on the phone earlier.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.995
I remember. You told me I have
a beautiful speaking voice.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.455
You do. It's even nicer in person.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.624
Anyway, I was calling about my son,

14:35.708 --> 14:39.712
who, you know,
he requires a special environment,

14:39.795 --> 14:42.381
specifically, a private dressing room,

14:42.464 --> 14:44.884
no music, dim lighting.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.719
Yes, and I said I'd see what I could do.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.971
-Uh-huh.
-Turns out, I couldn't do anything.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.474
Sorry. We're just in the middle.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
Sorry.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
I just don't understand
why you didn't say, "I'm sorry, ma'am,

14:57.021 --> 14:58.314
but I can't help you."

14:59.273 --> 15:01.150
"Go spend your money elsewhere."

15:01.233 --> 15:04.194
Preferably somewhere that is sensitive

15:04.278 --> 15:06.822
-to the needs of its diverse client base.
-Mm-hmm.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.158
I'll say that next time.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.167
Aw, hell yes.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.127
Slow clap, all the points.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.964
Zippers, buckles, flaps?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.174
I hate it.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.384
Trust me,
leather jackets are chick magnets.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.887
I wore one to a co-ed wedding shower

15:29.970 --> 15:32.640
and got a two-hour foot massage
from the bride's cousin.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.643
Not the hot one,
but the hot-enough one.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.020
It doesn't feel like me.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.731
Julia said to find clothes
that feel like me.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.276
You're trying to get girls.
The last thing you want to be is yourself.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.402
I'm taking it off.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.571
Trust me, Sam.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.657
It's not like I'm asking
for the moon here.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.118
I mean, all I'm asking is
just a little consideration.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.579
Imagine what it's like
to be on the spectrum

15:55.663 --> 15:57.957
in a place like this,
with the harsh lighting,

15:58.040 --> 16:00.668
[stammering] and the music that's so loud

16:00.751 --> 16:02.503
and people jostling by, you know?

16:02.586 --> 16:03.879
-Ma'am.
-What?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.298
-Did you just push me?
-What? No!

16:06.382 --> 16:07.716
I was demonstrating!

16:08.717 --> 16:10.761
This is it. I found it.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.429
Great. Now lose it again.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.181
That shirt is terrible, bro.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.392
-It's not even shiny.
-I love it.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.603
It's 100% cotton,
which is my favorite percentage of cotton.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.189
And it has eight Antarctic whales on it,

16:22.272 --> 16:24.608
which is higher than I've seen
on any other shirt.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.779
Fine. If you have to get the whale shirt,
at least wear this over it.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.033
Hi, honey.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.118
Um...

16:34.702 --> 16:37.830
I've been banished from the store...

16:37.913 --> 16:39.498
basically, for being a good mom.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.125
So here's my credit card.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.835
You know, buy two or three things,

16:42.918 --> 16:44.545
and I'll meet you out front.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.297
I know what I'm getting...
this wonderful whale shirt

16:47.381 --> 16:49.299
and this terrible leather jacket,

16:49.383 --> 16:51.802
which Zahid says will help me get  chicas,

16:51.885 --> 16:54.596
which means "girls,"
which was the whole reason for coming.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.265
Wait... What?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.017
That was the whole point of coming?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.184
Of course.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.062
And Julia knew about this?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.147
It was her idea.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.773
Huh. Terrific.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.816
Uh...

17:06.567 --> 17:07.443
[clears throat]

17:07.526 --> 17:09.153
Yes. I'm coming.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.322
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you out front.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.710
So... girls, huh?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.628
Where?

17:26.712 --> 17:27.713
No, I just mean...

17:29.256 --> 17:31.175
Is this something you really want?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.010
I mean, you want to date?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.971
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.808
Well, not unless I date
a great white shark.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.310
[both chuckle]

17:41.393 --> 17:43.145
No, I know what you mean.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.522
-You mean my feelings, right?
-Yeah.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.235
Talking to girls
makes me a little nervous,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.780
but Julia says it's good
to do things that scare you.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.449
Sometimes.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.202
Fear is also there
for a biological reason.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.537
I mean, fight-or-flight, right?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.331
If I'm walking down a dark alley

18:03.040 --> 18:04.750
and I start to feel afraid,

18:04.833 --> 18:08.545
that's my body trying to protect me
from gang boys with knives.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.299
Mom, I'm getting older,

18:12.382 --> 18:15.219
and at some point, I really hope...

18:16.261 --> 18:17.888
that I get to see boobs.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.062
You know, we should get
six more pillows each.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.273
That way, we could both throw
our own six pillows off the bed.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.692
I think we could afford
that expense, right?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.236
-Yeah.
-[clears throat]

18:33.612 --> 18:34.655
[groans]

18:35.405 --> 18:36.490
[exhales deeply]

18:37.116 --> 18:38.325
I think...

18:40.202 --> 18:42.371
Julia has too much influence over Sam.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.332
He's getting too attached to her.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.500
Really?

18:48.252 --> 18:49.837
I think she's good. He likes her.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.589
I mean, he's doing well socially, right?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.842
Yeah, but he just puts too much stock

18:54.925 --> 18:56.135
in everything she says.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.304
You should've seen him today.
Everything was, "Julia says this,

18:59.388 --> 19:00.639
Julia says that."

19:00.722 --> 19:01.849
Well, is that bad?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.143
Yes. She's pushing him.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.812
She's like 12,
and she's pushing him and pushing him.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.522
She's gonna push him too far.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.232
I have to go talk to her.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.734
Well, just be nice.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.778
I'm always nice.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.031
I'm probably not supposed
to be telling you this,

19:18.115 --> 19:20.033
but Casey has some sort of boyfriend.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.743
Oh, yeah, I know that.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.829
I read all her texts.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.165
I love that.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.292
[school bell rings]

19:29.918 --> 19:30.919
Cool shirt.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.173
Thanks. I'm hoping it'll get me
a practice girlfriend.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.633
I was being sarcastic. You look stupid.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.343
But hey, you're not hideous.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.430
I'm sure some sad insecure girl
will crush on you someday,

19:41.513 --> 19:43.849
deep in the very far future.

19:43.932 --> 19:44.892
I wish.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.686
Now, jacket or no jacket?

19:47.769 --> 19:50.022
Zahid thinks jacket,
but I think no jacket.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.857
As many jackets as you can find.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.655
Hey, Sam, this is random,

19:58.739 --> 20:02.826
but do you know why Dad wasn't
at the first Autism Awareness Walk?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.453
In 2004?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.370
Mm-hmm.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.580
That's the year he left us.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.208
What do you mean, he left us?

20:10.125 --> 20:12.586
Like, he moved out of the house?

20:12.669 --> 20:14.421
Yes, for eight months.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.506
Are you sure?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.258
How could he do that?

20:19.176 --> 20:22.763
I guess he packed his clothes
and drove off.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.902
[school bell rings]

20:56.838 --> 20:58.465
God, I hate you.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.387
Not you. You seem fine.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.657
[exhales]

21:47.055 --> 21:48.598
[cellphone buzzes]

22:12.414 --> 22:15.917
I just... I can't believe
that my dad would leave us.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.712
Like, why?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.547
Was he having an affair?

22:21.256 --> 22:22.632
Or, like, does he have, like,

22:22.716 --> 22:25.802
a whole other family somewhere else?

22:26.762 --> 22:28.972
Just, it feels so unlike him.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.435
I'm sorry that I even brought it up.
I should've never said anything.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.687
No, I mean, I'm glad that I know.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.066
I thought that we were so close.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.444
Like, who abandons their family?

22:45.322 --> 22:49.076
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
my dad's got a gambling problem.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.119
And last year, he stole my identity.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.498
[laughs]

22:54.581 --> 22:55.665
[chuckles]

22:56.708 --> 22:57.793
[chuckles]

22:57.876 --> 22:59.586
Yeah. I don't think it's that funny.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.004
[both laugh]

23:02.255 --> 23:04.591
[Doug] Okay, well, thank you for calling.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.009
I appreciate it.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.844
Okay. Thank you.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.137
-[phone beeps]
-Shit.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.722
I know! There's no jelly in this.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.975
No, that was Casey's coach.
She wasn't in her history class today.

23:14.643 --> 23:18.146
She got suspended. I don't know if
she's trying to get suspended again.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.774
She won't answer the phone.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.943
You think she's with the boyfriend?

23:24.027 --> 23:25.612
I think she's with the boyfriend.

23:26.279 --> 23:29.866
Actually, you know what?
Go to Kennedy Park. They hang out there.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.202
-Let's go by there.
-Let's kill him.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.579
-Take it easy, Chuck.
-No, we're gonna kill him.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.125
Chapter eight... photosynthesis.
Who's excited?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.752
[echoing] You guys all read this
last night in your...

23:40.836 --> 23:43.922
[Sam]  When a lobster gets too large
for its shell, it molts.

heterotrophs...

24:04.401 --> 24:07.070
[Sam]  Sometimes, you must
get rid of your outer layer.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.493
Uh, Sam?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.372
Yes, Miss Jablonski?

24:18.206 --> 24:20.792
-Is everything okay?
-Yes. Thank you.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.210
Is everything okay with you?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.671
Yes, I'm fine.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.174
Okay. That's good.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.599
-[Casey] You've got to be kidding me.
-[Evan] Hmm?

24:40.645 --> 24:42.647
-Really? This is what you're doing?
-What?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.691
Skipping school after getting suspended?

24:44.774 --> 24:47.402
-Are you gonna ask why?
-Because of this asshole.

24:47.485 --> 24:50.238
-You said he wouldn't be a distraction.
-I'm not distracted by him.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.115
-I'm distracted by you.
-What?

24:52.782 --> 24:53.950
I know that you left us.

24:54.701 --> 24:55.702
In 2004.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.746
For eight months.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.790
Oh, forget it.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.046
Casey!

25:07.339 --> 25:08.173
So...

25:09.966 --> 25:11.509
You stole a tuba?

25:17.140 --> 25:18.308
[Doug]
Casey.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.356
Casey.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.028
Listen...

25:31.821 --> 25:33.323
I never told you about that,

25:33.406 --> 25:35.283
because, honestly, it's just...

25:38.161 --> 25:40.080
It's not something I'm very proud of.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.208
Okay?

25:44.668 --> 25:47.545
You know, it was hard
when your brother was born.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.341
It was hard having a son who...

25:52.050 --> 25:53.551
didn't smile and...

25:55.011 --> 25:56.513
look you in the eye.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.435
And I kept thinking
things would get better,

26:02.519 --> 26:05.438
and he would grow out of it,
and then he was diagnosed and...

26:07.649 --> 26:10.110
You know, Mom threw herself
into all of it,

26:10.193 --> 26:12.570
with the support groups
and the special diets,

26:12.654 --> 26:13.738
and she was great.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.825
I just...

26:19.035 --> 26:21.037
I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

26:22.205 --> 26:25.083
[stammering] And I felt like
I was just messing things up.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.002
So I left.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.798
Okay, and it wasn't your fault,

26:31.881 --> 26:33.091
and it wasn't Mom and Sam.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.175
It was me.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.307
Where'd you go?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.100
I went to Grandpa's cabin.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.059
And...

26:43.685 --> 26:46.646
first, he wanted me to build an addition
to the house, and...

26:47.689 --> 26:49.149
and I just stayed.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.986
I built a stupid fire pit and...

26:54.863 --> 26:56.781
I drank beers, and it was...

26:58.825 --> 26:59.701
It sucked.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.289
I'm embarrassed that it even happened.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.628
I can't believe that you left us.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.797
I know, but I'm sorry, okay?

27:12.881 --> 27:16.217
And you know I love you so much.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.386
Okay? I love you more than anything.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.596
Yeah, I know.

27:20.638 --> 27:21.890
I know.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.141
I get it.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.102
I want to leave every single day.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.229
But you can't leave.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.397
[chuckles]

27:31.733 --> 27:33.318
Look, I just want to--

27:33.401 --> 27:36.112
I want to make things good
between the two of us.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.281
Okay? Please? Can you tell me we're good?

27:39.074 --> 27:39.991
Yeah.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.618
We're good, Dad.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.374
I'm acting erratically. I know that.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.584
But here's what I don't know.

27:49.667 --> 27:53.963
I don't know who I am anymore.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.634
[Elsa]
I don't know who needs me.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.802
Hi!

27:59.469 --> 28:00.970
I like your shirt.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.806
Are you being sarcastic?

28:02.889 --> 28:04.349
Oh, no.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.893
-Then thank you.
-Wai--

28:09.437 --> 28:10.814
[Elsa]
Certainly not Sam.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.776
I don't know what I want.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.694
[sighs]

28:25.120 --> 28:26.955
[Elsa]
I don't know what's coming next.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.502
Or what to expect.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.465
[exhales]

29:14.502 --> 29:16.921
[Elsa]
Because everything is changing.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.810
[keys clank]

29:42.280 --> 29:44.866
And I'm not so good without my routines.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.787
[Doug]
You ready to go, Casey?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.580
I'm gonna kick your butt!

29:57.170 --> 29:58.171
Casey?

30:06.429 --> 30:08.181
[panting]
