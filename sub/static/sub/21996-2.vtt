34:01.864 --> 34:03.998
ZAK: Okay, hold on.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.233
0.3.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.068
Go around the doll. 0.3.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.837
JAY AND ZAK: 0.4.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.806
And there is no electronic
around here.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.074
-Hold on, Jay. 0.5.
-0.5.

34:14.176 --> 34:15.576
Hold on. Hold on.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.878
0.7. 0.9.

34:17.980 --> 34:19.947
-1.1!
-Holy...

34:21.217 --> 34:23.117
Stay there, Jay.

34:23.219 --> 34:24.485
1.1.

34:26.322 --> 34:27.555
1.2.

34:27.657 --> 34:32.359
We are documenting an amazing
high EMF reading on the doll,

34:32.461 --> 34:34.595
a 1.2-milligauss reading.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.030
That could be where
she got hit by it...

34:36.132 --> 34:37.898
This is incredible.
...you know what I mean,
to knock her off?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.233
Yes, yes. Oh, my god.

34:39.335 --> 34:41.602
The residual energy of what
I believe is the spirit

34:41.704 --> 34:43.971
pushing this doll over
is still on the doll,

34:44.073 --> 34:46.840
or the spirit
is still in the doll

34:46.943 --> 34:49.810
'cause this reading right now
is absolutely insane --

34:49.912 --> 34:51.378
1.0.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.913
Stay on it.

34:53.015 --> 34:55.015
Just to show you,
there is nothing electric

34:55.117 --> 34:57.718
around Jay whatsoever,

34:57.820 --> 34:59.119
and he is documenting,

34:59.221 --> 35:02.756
still holding steady
at a 0.9 milligauss reading.

35:02.858 --> 35:04.725
Stay there.
I'm gonna pick the doll up.

35:04.827 --> 35:05.960
Okay.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.595
Okay.

35:07.697 --> 35:11.999
Oh, my god.
My hand is ice cold, Jay.

35:13.135 --> 35:16.036
Okay, hold on.
Keep the meter where it was.

35:16.138 --> 35:17.538
0.7.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.373
0.6.

35:19.475 --> 35:21.175
0.5.

35:24.313 --> 35:25.646
0.4.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.181
It's slowly going away.

35:27.283 --> 35:28.582
Hold on.

35:28.684 --> 35:30.284
ZAK AND JAY: 0.3.

35:30.386 --> 35:33.821
Now, I'm gonna
put the doll back.

35:36.692 --> 35:37.791
0.1.

35:37.893 --> 35:39.193
-0.0.
-Wow.

35:39.295 --> 35:43.297
Whatever is here has left.

35:43.399 --> 35:47.101
Ladies and gentlemen, that is
a scientific reading

35:47.203 --> 35:50.537
of something remarkable
just captured on camera.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.907
<i>I want you to pick the doll</i>
<i>that...</i>

35:54.010 --> 35:55.609
<i>[ Clatters ]</i>
<i>Ohh!</i>

35:55.711 --> 35:59.346
<i>... that -- Ohh!</i>

36:00.549 --> 36:02.116
I am a little frightened.

36:02.218 --> 36:03.283
-Zak, no.
-Aah!

36:03.386 --> 36:05.686
-What? What?
-What happened?

36:05.788 --> 36:07.021
<i>[ Cannon fires ]</i>

36:07.123 --> 36:09.723
¶¶

36:11.853 --> 36:15.588
ZAK: Here's a sneak peek
at our next Hauntings of
Vicksburg investigation.

36:15.690 --> 36:17.990
Murder --
cold-blooded murder.

36:18.092 --> 36:21.260
It's a small town,
and word travels.

36:21.362 --> 36:24.664
ZAK: If you are the person
who was murdered here,

36:24.766 --> 36:27.500
we're here to help you.

36:27.602 --> 36:31.537
MAN: This is a place
full of restless spirits.

36:31.639 --> 36:34.974
ZAK: Pull up -- I'm gonna talk
to this police officer.

36:35.076 --> 36:37.877
It'll give you a chill up
the back every once in awhile.

36:37.979 --> 36:40.279
If you need any help,
just scream.

36:40.381 --> 36:42.381
<i>[ Cannon fires ]</i>

36:42.483 --> 36:46.419
¶¶

36:48.956 --> 36:50.589
What you just saw was

36:50.692 --> 36:53.125
our investigation
of the Genella building.

36:53.227 --> 36:55.728
We're gonna show you
something else that happened

36:55.830 --> 36:59.398
that you haven't seen yet.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.201
Your husband told me
that he had one of

37:02.303 --> 37:06.038
the most terrifying experiences
of his life in here.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.008
I had a real terrifying
experience here.

37:09.110 --> 37:12.978
I've only been touched, um,
a few times doing this.

37:13.081 --> 37:15.481
-Touched?
-Touched.

37:15.583 --> 37:18.951
These two guys went upstairs
to the top floor

37:19.053 --> 37:20.986
and had some feelings,

37:21.089 --> 37:24.924
so they called me
to finish the night

37:25.026 --> 37:27.360
by going back up there
with them.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.929
You know we're coming
after you, right?

37:30.031 --> 37:33.099
I did use
a little provocation, okay,

37:33.201 --> 37:35.101
just because I wanted to see

37:35.203 --> 37:39.572
if something dark was here,
something malevolent

37:39.674 --> 37:43.909
that -- that had an experience
with your husband.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.645
I wanted to see that
if I could call it out.

37:46.748 --> 37:49.782
How do you like
the name Jesus Christ?

37:49.884 --> 37:54.320
What does that do to you,
the name Jesus Christ?

37:57.325 --> 38:01.127
If you're terrorizing
this family,

38:01.229 --> 38:03.162
terrorize us.

38:06.968 --> 38:09.368
Is this where you hide?

38:14.809 --> 38:16.742
BILLY: It feels different
up here, Aaron.

38:16.844 --> 38:18.110
AARON: It does.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.480
All of the sudden,

38:21.582 --> 38:25.217
I feel as if
someone were to take their thumb

38:25.319 --> 38:29.455
and jab me in the back,
right in the center of my spine,

38:29.557 --> 38:33.359
twice, extremely hard.

38:33.461 --> 38:35.995
And whatever did that,
whatever I felt

38:36.097 --> 38:38.197
that had no body to do this,

38:38.299 --> 38:39.632
had no bone and finger,

38:39.734 --> 38:43.169
and being able
to still feel that, that hard,

38:43.271 --> 38:44.937
I believe
it's a condensed energy

38:45.039 --> 38:48.774
that's so strong of a spirit,
of an entity

38:48.876 --> 38:52.645
injected straight into my spine
and gave me a shockwave.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.381
It was like a Taser gun
of terror,

38:55.483 --> 38:57.216
and it had residual effects.

38:57.318 --> 39:02.621
After that, I went into
a full-on uncontrollable panic.

39:02.723 --> 39:05.991
Something just shrouded
around me,

39:06.093 --> 39:08.661
and I was in pure terror,

39:08.763 --> 39:11.030
so I want to just
play you this moment,

39:11.132 --> 39:12.298
and I'll be honest with you.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.467
-I don't like watching it.
-[ Whispers ] Oh.

39:16.838 --> 39:19.138
ZAK: Whoa! Aah!

39:19.240 --> 39:20.973
-BILLY AND AARON: What happened?
-Aah!

39:21.075 --> 39:23.108
-What happened, bro?
-Oh, my god.

39:23.211 --> 39:25.010
-What?
-What happened? What happened?

39:25.112 --> 39:27.079
-What?
-Dude, what happened?

39:27.181 --> 39:28.547
Zak! Zak!

39:28.649 --> 39:31.217
Dude, what -- what happened?

39:31.319 --> 39:32.551
Tell me what happened.

39:32.653 --> 39:35.321
-AARON: What happened?
-Zak! Zak! What happened, bro?

39:35.423 --> 39:37.857
-Bro, what happened?
-ZAK: Something...

39:37.959 --> 39:39.124
What's going on?
What's going on?

39:39.227 --> 39:40.893
What's going on?
Step back.

39:40.995 --> 39:43.062
Stand your ground. Stand your
ground. Stand your ground.

39:43.164 --> 39:45.731
-What happened?
-[ Breathing heavily ]

39:45.833 --> 39:47.132
-What happened, dude?
-AARON: What happened, buddy?

39:47.235 --> 39:48.868
Please tell me
what happened, dude.

39:50.304 --> 39:53.739
Zak, what -- what happened?

39:53.841 --> 39:56.008
Dude, what happened?
Please, talk.

39:56.110 --> 39:59.678
[ Breathing deeply ]

39:59.780 --> 40:03.115
-[ Zak speaks indistinctly ]
-What happened, man?

40:03.217 --> 40:06.252
[ Continues breathing deeply ]

40:18.266 --> 40:20.366
That was a bit much.

40:20.468 --> 40:22.368
I felt like I was gonna die.

40:22.470 --> 40:23.602
It was that bad.

40:23.704 --> 40:26.205
My heart was beating so fast
that I thought

40:26.307 --> 40:27.373
it was going to explode.

40:27.475 --> 40:29.542
¶¶

40:29.644 --> 40:31.010
That's what scared me.

40:31.112 --> 40:34.280
Whatever this was,
it touched me.

40:34.382 --> 40:35.981
That's how it started.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.485
These two very, very hard jabs
in the center of my spine,

40:39.587 --> 40:42.488
but it wasn't that,
that I was reacting to.

40:42.590 --> 40:45.891
It's what was in me and around
me during those moments.

40:45.993 --> 40:47.126
-<i> Aah!</i>

40:47.228 --> 40:48.961
<i>-What happened? What happened?</i>
<i>-Aah!</i>

40:49.063 --> 40:50.763
<i>What happened, bro?</i>
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

40:50.865 --> 40:53.198
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-What happened? What happened?</i>

40:55.403 --> 40:57.970
Those screams were --
were of pure terror

40:58.072 --> 40:59.838
of what I was experiencing.

40:59.941 --> 41:02.374
It was like a web
just went around me.

41:05.179 --> 41:07.846
Look, this is your building,
this is your business,

41:07.949 --> 41:11.050
but my job to you is
to be completely honest.

41:11.152 --> 41:13.252
I don't want you to be fearful
of this place.

41:13.354 --> 41:15.020
You don't think I should
be fearful of what I just saw?

41:15.122 --> 41:17.823
I understand, and I know
that you live here,

41:17.925 --> 41:20.159
but I don't think
this is demonic.

41:20.261 --> 41:22.428
Well, if it's not,
then why were you so afraid?

41:22.530 --> 41:26.498
I think that something
let me feel

41:26.601 --> 41:30.869
the pure pain and fright
that it had.

41:30.972 --> 41:33.572
I didn't have any anger in me
at all.

41:33.674 --> 41:35.808
It was pure terror.

41:35.910 --> 41:39.278
So this sounds like the same
thing my husband experienced.

41:39.380 --> 41:41.647
Yeah, and I think
it's pretty severe.

41:41.749 --> 41:42.815
What are you feeling right now?

41:42.917 --> 41:44.783
'Cause I don't want
to scare you.

41:44.885 --> 41:47.686
Well, I am a little frightened,
but we're gonna pray.

41:47.788 --> 41:50.489
We're gonna pray this
out of here because I won't run.

41:50.591 --> 41:51.824
I won't pack up and run.

41:51.926 --> 41:55.260
Sometimes, just saying something
direct from your heart,

41:55.363 --> 41:57.062
we use that in a way.

41:57.164 --> 41:58.797
And that's just what
we're gonna do.

41:58.899 --> 42:01.033
I'm glad I know now,
thanks to you guys.
Yeah.
