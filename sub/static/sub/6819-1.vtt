Hey, Gilbert.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.176
Hi, Lewis.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.179
I got you some more
reading material.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.714
Great minds,
huh?

04:10.783 --> 04:12.683
Yeah. Hey,
how you feelin'?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.652
Actually, I'm feeling
pretty stupid.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.690
I'm the only guy
in the world

04:17.757 --> 04:20.658
who could break his leg
playing chess.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.661
Don't get down
on yourself.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.697
That was
a tricky move.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.753
Thanks.

04:25.832 --> 04:26.764
Sure.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.535
What's on your mind,
Lewis?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.699
Well, I'll tell
you, Gilbert.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.209
You're the president
of this chapter.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.543
I don't know
if I can lead these guys.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.014
Lewis, you're
a born leader.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.017
You got
a Kennedy's looks

04:46.085 --> 04:48.053
and an Einstein's brains.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.589
And the prowess
of a Skolnick.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.226
That's my dad.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.228
I got to go, Gilbert.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.263
Okay.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.354
Bye.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.762
Knock 'em dead.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.864
I'll be
in touch!

05:05.972 --> 05:06.939
Tickets?

05:07.006 --> 05:08.530
- Check.
- Check.
- Check.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.597
Money?

05:09.676 --> 05:11.200

- Check.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.471
Prophylactics?

05:12.545 --> 05:13.910
- Ch...
- Ch...

05:19.485 --> 05:21.419
You kill me, Dad!

05:21.487 --> 05:23.921
You've really got
the pedal on the metal.

05:23.990 --> 05:28.427
Yeah, I do. I've got
the cruise control locked into 35.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.292
Kick it up to 37.
Let's live dangerously.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.422
Dad!

05:36.502 --> 05:39.130
Uplink.
Here's my pager.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.277
Here you go, Dad.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.404
Plug that
into the lighter.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.744
Okay.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.681
Needs 13.8 volts.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.582
"Gilbert to Lewis."

05:53.653 --> 05:55.678
Hey, guys,
it's Gilbert!

They're here...

06:43.302 --> 06:45.327
nerds.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.443
You know what?

06:51.511 --> 06:52.478
What?

06:52.545 --> 06:53.910
According to this,

06:53.980 --> 06:55.948
the year-round
mean temperature

06:56.015 --> 06:57.915
in Fort Lauderdale's
72 degrees.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.451
Well, guy,

06:59.519 --> 07:02.386
it's located 26 degrees,
4 minutes north, longitude,

07:02.455 --> 07:04.889
80 degrees, 9 minutes
west, latitude.

07:04.957 --> 07:08.393
What'd you expect?
68 degrees?

07:10.797 --> 07:12.389
Excuse me, miss.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.400
I don't intend to sleep
with another woman

07:15.468 --> 07:18.403
until I'm back here
in your arms

07:18.471 --> 07:21.406
with my head resting
between your creamy thighs.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.372
Jerk!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.912
Excuse me, miss.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.810
I don't intend
to sleep...

07:28.881 --> 07:32.408
are you with the special group
from Adams College?

07:32.485 --> 07:33.918
Yes, sir.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.920
May I see
your tickets?

07:35.988 --> 07:38.422
I'll take you
to your plane

07:38.491 --> 07:40.425
through the VIP
entrance.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.927
Did you hear that?
We're VIPs.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.826
This is
gonna be awesome.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.900
Where did Booger go?

07:50.036 --> 07:51.333
You pig!

07:54.006 --> 07:55.439
We're VIPs.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.941
Right here.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.670
Very Immense Penises.

08:08.954 --> 08:09.943
Uh.

08:12.424 --> 08:14.892
Well, men,
we finally made it.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.893
Wormser, is this
changing climate

08:17.963 --> 08:19.396
affecting
your allergies?

08:19.464 --> 08:21.364
I'm a little clogged.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.901
I wish I had
some Hexadol.

08:23.969 --> 08:25.903
30 or 50
milligrams?

08:25.971 --> 08:27.905
Do you have
the liquid?

08:27.973 --> 08:29.406
Cherry
or menthol?

08:29.474 --> 08:32.909
Why don't you blow your nose
on your shirt?

08:32.977 --> 08:34.808
Wow!
That limo's for us!

08:36.381 --> 08:37.871
Are you sure

08:37.948 --> 08:40.884
this is for the United
Fraternity Conference?

08:40.952 --> 08:41.941
Yup.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.385
Take this, please.

08:43.455 --> 08:44.820

10:41.439 --> 10:43.930

of those coconuts!

11:28.587 --> 11:30.680
Gee, those are
big ones.

11:30.755 --> 11:34.156
Wow! I've never seen
anything like it!

11:34.226 --> 11:37.627
There's no reason
we all have to check in.

11:37.696 --> 11:42.156
I'll do it if you
want to hit the beach early.

11:46.504 --> 11:48.472
Wait up!

12:32.817 --> 12:35.115
Boys, our ship
has come in.

12:39.991 --> 12:41.959
May I help you, sir?

12:47.499 --> 12:49.296
Are you okay, sir?

12:49.367 --> 12:51.801
I'm fine.
Is my hair okay?

12:51.870 --> 12:52.837
Yeah.

12:55.307 --> 12:56.934
Stewart!

12:59.511 --> 13:00.978
What's
your problem?

13:01.046 --> 13:02.911
Lots of
problems, sir,

13:02.981 --> 13:04.915
starting with
a painful childbirth,

13:04.983 --> 13:07.918
leading up to
this embarrassing, awkward moment.

13:07.986 --> 13:09.920
Comstock, yes,
Jeffrey and Helen.

13:09.988 --> 13:11.421
C- O-M...

13:11.489 --> 13:14.117
S- T-O-C-K.
Fine. Fine.

13:14.192 --> 13:15.591
Sir, excuse me.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.628
That accident
wasn't his fault.

13:17.696 --> 13:21.427
It was mine,
so I hope nobody was hurt...

13:21.499 --> 13:22.830
or will be.

13:25.937 --> 13:26.961
Ow!

13:27.038 --> 13:29.905
And that's how we won
the Greek Council.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.840
I play the violin.

13:33.545 --> 13:36.412
Can I get you a drink
or something?

13:36.481 --> 13:37.846
Don't go away.

13:40.018 --> 13:42.452
Hey, Poindexter,
she got a sister?

13:42.520 --> 13:44.988
I don't know.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.456
I'm gonna buy her
a drink.

13:47.525 --> 13:49.959
Jesus! Anybody
know how to say

13:50.028 --> 13:51.962
"bite my crank"
in Spanish?

13:52.030 --> 13:54.965
<i>Muerde mi manubrio,</i>
<i>por favor.</i>

13:55.033 --> 13:56.933
I'm a polyglot.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.438
I got to buy
this girl a drink.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.029
But, Poin...

14:08.546 --> 14:11.879
It's really cool of you
to take the blame.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.384
I thought this
would be another

14:14.452 --> 14:17.421
in my never-ending
series of poundings.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.923
People pound me
all the time.

14:19.991 --> 14:22.425
I guess
I'm a screw-up.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.927
Believe
in yourself

14:23.995 --> 14:26.930
and you can be
a big screw-up.

14:26.998 --> 14:27.965
Ah!

14:28.033 --> 14:29.898
What I
meant was,

14:29.968 --> 14:31.902
if you believe
in yourself,

14:31.970 --> 14:33.938
you can be
a giant.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.438
Lewis Skolnick.

14:35.507 --> 14:36.838
Stewart Lipsey.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.345
Two rum and cokes, please.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.854
Welcome to the Royal Flamingo.
May I help you?

14:56.661 --> 14:57.992
Sir?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.894
Yeah... yes!

14:59.964 --> 15:02.364
Um, sorry,
Lewis Skolnick

15:02.434 --> 15:04.902
of the Lambda Lambda Lambda
delegation.

15:04.969 --> 15:07.062
We have
a girlfriend.

15:07.138 --> 15:10.403
Uh, I mean
reservations.

15:10.475 --> 15:12.033
Oh, no.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.907
This computer
hates me.

15:13.978 --> 15:16.879
Let me get someone
who can help you.

15:16.948 --> 15:19.917
I know a thing or two
about computers.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.918
Maybe I
could help you.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.782
Well, I type in
your name,

15:25.857 --> 15:27.916
press search,
and... nothing.

15:27.992 --> 15:29.926
I've already spotted
your problem.

15:29.994 --> 15:31.586
It's stroke
technique.

15:31.663 --> 15:33.426
Excuse me?

15:33.498 --> 15:37.059
Stroke technique. See, you have
to arch your fingers.

15:38.503 --> 15:40.130
Try that.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.935
Like this?

15:44.008 --> 15:45.805
Uh-huh.

15:45.877 --> 15:47.777
It worked!

15:47.846 --> 15:51.407
Yeah. See, look...
"Lewis Skolnick..." Cancelled?

15:51.483 --> 15:53.610
That can't be right.

15:53.685 --> 15:57.348
I'm sorry. Your rooms have
been given to someone else.

15:57.422 --> 16:00.414
We're the Tri-Lambs
from Adams College.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.892
It's important
that we stay here.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.259
Isn't there anything
you can do?

16:07.432 --> 16:09.400
Listen, i'm just
a trainee,

16:09.467 --> 16:12.834
but let me talk
to my manager, Mr. Mussinger.

16:12.904 --> 16:14.838
He can straighten
this out.

16:14.906 --> 16:17.067
That'd be great,
uh...

16:17.142 --> 16:19.076
Sunny.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.202
Sunny.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.379
Thanks.

16:23.448 --> 16:24.745
Sorry.

16:30.622 --> 16:31.850
Mr. Mussinger?

16:33.492 --> 16:36.552
The Lambdas from
Adams College are here.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.688
The computer shows
we gave their room away.

16:39.764 --> 16:42.927
I don't want nerds
staying in this hotel.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.936
This poor guy has
no place to stay!

16:46.004 --> 16:48.336
That room
has to stay empty.

16:48.406 --> 16:49.498
Why?

16:49.574 --> 16:50.506
Fire law.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.378
To which fire law
are you referring, sir?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.851
Who's the manager
of this hotel?

17:02.921 --> 17:04.548
Fred C. Dobbs.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.647
Who's the acting manager?

17:06.724 --> 17:08.352
You, sir.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.951
Good.
Who's the trainee?

17:11.029 --> 17:12.394
Me, sir.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.864
Who's to obey
the fire laws?

17:14.933 --> 17:16.798
Me, sir.
Excuse me.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.099
Now, where were we?

17:25.944 --> 17:27.912
Geek alert
at 3:00.

17:29.481 --> 17:30.914
Booger!
Booger!

17:30.982 --> 17:32.415
Go, baby!

17:32.484 --> 17:34.384
Booger, Lewis
has a problem.

17:34.452 --> 17:36.886
He needs our help.
Come on.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.047
Rrrrr!

17:38.123 --> 17:40.387
Come on, Booger.
Wormser!

17:40.458 --> 17:43.427
How far is Daytona Beach
from Fort Lauderdale?

17:43.495 --> 17:44.757
What?

17:44.829 --> 17:47.093
Fort Lauderdale
Men's Club, right?

17:47.165 --> 17:49.099
No rooms available?

17:49.167 --> 17:50.600
Okay, thanks.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.000
Thanks.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.572
Hey, guys,
how's it goin'?

17:55.640 --> 17:57.574
That one's
full, too.

17:57.642 --> 17:59.610
That's
the ninth one.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.010
We'll only be
here five days.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.514
Do we really
need a room?

18:06.084 --> 18:08.552
Oh, wow.
Look at these geeks.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.021
What kind of a fraternity
lets these guys in?

18:12.090 --> 18:13.523
Listen, Rog,

18:13.592 --> 18:17.028
I don't want these nerds
hangin' around my hotel.

18:17.095 --> 18:18.528
Buzz, relax.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.531
These guys
are history.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.531
Watch.

18:23.635 --> 18:27.628
Pardon me. Are you guys
the Lambdas from Adams College?

18:27.706 --> 18:28.695
Why?

18:28.773 --> 18:30.240
I'm Roger Lattimore,

18:30.308 --> 18:32.674
chairman of the United
Fraternity Council.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.211
Call me Rog.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.940
Hey, Rog.
Lewis Skolnick.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.709
Lambda Lambda Lamda,
Adams.

18:37.782 --> 18:40.478
I heard you guys
couldn't get a room.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.679
It's been so trying.

18:42.754 --> 18:46.281
I'll bet. I wish
I could help you,

18:46.358 --> 18:49.759
but it's
out of my hands.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.888
The manager here
is Buzz Mussinger. Hi, Buzz.

18:52.964 --> 18:54.761
Can you
introduce me?

18:54.833 --> 18:57.233
Buzz is an Alpha,
like me.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.202
You mean Alpha Beta?

18:59.270 --> 19:02.296
Yeah. He doesn't
want you guys staying here.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.171
You know how it is.

19:04.242 --> 19:07.006
So I guess you guys'll
just leave, huh?

19:07.078 --> 19:08.978
I'll call you a cab.

19:09.047 --> 19:12.039
Wait a minute.
I think I found one.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.051
The Hotel
Coral Essex.

19:14.119 --> 19:15.882
Full recreation
facilities,

19:15.954 --> 19:17.717
spacious
oceanview suites!

19:17.789 --> 19:19.222
Sounds great!

19:19.290 --> 19:20.814
Confirm it, Poindexter.

19:20.892 --> 19:21.984
Fantastic.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.551
Roger, I guess
we'll see you

19:24.629 --> 19:26.529
at the conference
tomorrow.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.566
Well, gentlemen,
no point

19:28.633 --> 19:31.534
in hanging around
this dump any longer.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.298
Heaven awaits!

19:50.655 --> 19:52.486
Must be
check-out time.

19:56.628 --> 20:00.587
They must have had
a heck of a party here.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.602
Ah!

20:08.640 --> 20:09.732
Hello!

20:12.143 --> 20:14.543
<i>Hola, mi hijo.</i>

20:14.612 --> 20:16.170
<i>Hablo inglés?</i>

20:17.649 --> 20:20.140
Yes, you
speak English.

20:20.218 --> 20:23.187
We have a reservation.
We're the Tri-Lambs.

20:25.690 --> 20:28.124
Oh, yes.
Here it is.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.889
No problem.
You follow me.

20:32.697 --> 20:35.598
Your room is in
the Ricky Ricardo wing.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.635
I'm Aldonsa, your hostess.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.567
If you need anything,

20:39.637 --> 20:41.696
#You just call me #

20:41.773 --> 20:42.967
# Don't be afraid... ##

20:43.041 --> 20:45.942
Here is the beautiful
olympic-size swimming pool.

20:46.010 --> 20:49.537
You be sure you shower
before you use it.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.477
Didn't I just see...

20:53.551 --> 20:55.109
No!

20:59.390 --> 21:02.325
And over here
is the wonderful sauna.

21:05.663 --> 21:08.063
You be sure
you leave it

21:08.133 --> 21:10.101
the way you find it.

21:10.168 --> 21:13.103
And this is Tamu,
Mamu, and Shamu.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.160
Boys!

21:17.675 --> 21:18.767
Hey...

21:20.512 --> 21:22.104
Aah! Aah!

21:22.180 --> 21:24.045
Down the hall

21:24.115 --> 21:28.108
and to the left
is the coke... machine.

21:28.186 --> 21:30.620
Over here is the gym.

21:30.688 --> 21:32.121
Come on, Daddy.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.125
Want to go around
the world with Salina?

21:35.193 --> 21:38.094
Yeah. Let me make it
good for Daddy.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.631
Yoo hoo!
Come on, follow me!

21:40.698 --> 21:42.529
You big man, you.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.468
And over here,
this is your room,

21:47.539 --> 21:49.700
the Ricky Ricardo
suite.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.546
Boys!

22:49.634 --> 22:51.101
Oh, don't worry.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.194
It's just
a little evidence.

22:54.939 --> 22:57.635
# Magic carpet ##

22:57.709 --> 23:00.644
Now, you just make yourself
at home, okay?

23:05.149 --> 23:08.585
I'm just going to
cook you your lunch.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.605
Poindexter, that's
my pocket protector.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.614
Sorry, Lewis.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.016
Harold! Harold!

23:49.994 --> 23:51.894
That's cool!

23:54.699 --> 23:56.633
Trashed their house
last year.

23:56.701 --> 23:58.134
That didn't work.

23:58.202 --> 24:01.137
We locked them
out of the hotel.

24:01.205 --> 24:04.538
They checked into another.
What are we gonna do?

24:04.609 --> 24:07.077
What are you
askin' us for?

24:07.145 --> 24:10.046
You're the one with
the 2.0 average.

24:10.114 --> 24:11.172
2.2.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.080
Can't shake these guys.

24:13.151 --> 24:16.086
Christ, there could
be a nuclear war.

24:16.154 --> 24:19.089
There'd be nothin' left
but cockroaches and nerds.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.488
Let's kill 'em.

24:22.126 --> 24:23.150
Nah.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.100
Wait a second.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.602
I got it.
It's so simple.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.604
I mean,
they're nerds,

24:34.672 --> 24:37.106
but they're
men, too, sort of.

24:37.175 --> 24:40.611
What is every man in the world
afraid of?

24:40.678 --> 24:42.612
I don't know, Tiny.
What?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.614
At one time
or another,

24:44.682 --> 24:47.617
every man in this tub
has been petrified

24:47.685 --> 24:50.620
that a chick
would see him undressed

24:50.688 --> 24:52.622
and see
how small

24:52.690 --> 24:54.590
his dick really
is, right?

24:54.659 --> 24:55.785
Jesus!

24:55.860 --> 24:57.794
Come on, guys,
admit it!

24:57.862 --> 24:59.420
Yeah, sure.

24:59.497 --> 25:01.833
Whatever... Tiny.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.534
No. It's
a reverse nickname,

25:05.603 --> 25:08.197
like they call
redheaded guys blondie,

25:08.272 --> 25:09.864
right-handed
guys lefty.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.374
Are you finished?

25:11.442 --> 25:13.376
And bald guys Harry.

25:13.444 --> 25:14.911
Shut up!

25:14.979 --> 25:17.914
We got to get rid
of these guys

25:17.982 --> 25:19.643
in a major way.

25:25.723 --> 25:28.021
Hold it,
hold it, fellas.

25:28.092 --> 25:30.993
I'm gettin'
an idea here.

25:31.062 --> 25:34.088
Yeah. By this time
tomorrow...

25:34.165 --> 25:36.156
the nerds will
be history.

25:38.135 --> 25:40.569
Nerds!

25:40.638 --> 25:42.572
Ogre, relax!

25:42.640 --> 25:45.108
Tomorrow you'll be
at the podium,

25:45.176 --> 25:47.610
and the nerds
will be packing.

25:47.678 --> 25:49.475
All right, Rog!

25:58.189 --> 26:00.020
Pony Express.

26:05.096 --> 26:06.563
What's this?

26:06.631 --> 26:09.464
I think it's
an invitation to a party.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.537
"Dear Tri-Lambs,
you are cordially invited

26:14.605 --> 26:16.573
"to the United
Fraternity

26:16.641 --> 26:18.074
"preconference
barbecue.

26:18.142 --> 26:20.042
Fraternally yours,
Roger Lattimore."

26:20.111 --> 26:21.510
Party, party, party!

26:21.579 --> 26:23.570
# Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily #

26:23.648 --> 26:25.616
# Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ##

26:25.683 --> 26:28.709
The preconference
barbecue is right down that path.

26:28.786 --> 26:30.811
Thanks for the ride.

26:32.657 --> 26:35.592
Guys, this is
gonna be a blast!

26:35.660 --> 26:37.992
We'll see you
when it's over.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.598
They even have
a band!

26:41.666 --> 26:45.568
Just our luck... We
get here during a drum solo.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.108
I don't know about this.

26:51.175 --> 26:53.075
Something doesn't
smell right.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.112
That's me.
I'm sorry.

26:55.179 --> 26:57.113
Anxiety makes
me flatulent.

26:57.181 --> 26:59.274
Take a valium
or something.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.585
Look!

27:01.652 --> 27:03.017
Holy shit!

27:05.623 --> 27:09.150
This must be
one of the last

27:09.226 --> 27:10.989
of the Seminole
Indian tribes.

27:13.597 --> 27:15.497
Jesus H. Christ!

27:18.135 --> 27:20.069
We got to help her.

27:22.139 --> 27:25.040
If not us, who?
If not now, when?

27:25.109 --> 27:27.168
Somebody else,
some other time.

27:27.244 --> 27:30.077
Lewis is right.
Are we mice or men?

27:30.147 --> 27:31.580
We are!

27:31.649 --> 27:33.549
When the going
gets tough,

27:33.617 --> 27:35.642
the tough get going.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.585
Now, that woman
out there

27:37.655 --> 27:39.247
needs our help.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.154
Come on, men.
Follow me.

27:52.303 --> 27:54.601
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy!

27:54.672 --> 27:57.800
What do you think
they're gonna do?

27:57.875 --> 28:00.776
I think they're
gonna sacrifice a virgin.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.335
I hope not.

28:02.413 --> 28:05.314
A virgin's
a terrible thing to waste.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.896
Aah!
There he goes!

28:31.609 --> 28:32.974
Come on, guys!

28:58.169 --> 28:59.397
Hit it, boys.

29:02.373 --> 29:04.534
What was that?

29:04.608 --> 29:06.371
I don't know.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.775
Be careful.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.677
Winston,
hit the lights.

29:16.921 --> 29:17.979
Look!

29:22.293 --> 29:23.783
Oh, my God!

29:23.861 --> 29:27.058
Trespassers have witnessed
sacred ritual.

29:27.131 --> 29:30.066
Must burn clothes
and chant...

29:30.134 --> 29:31.829
or die.

29:31.902 --> 29:33.563
What now, Mr. Hero?

29:33.637 --> 29:34.968
Me?

29:38.476 --> 29:39.636
Okay!

29:39.710 --> 29:41.268
Coming right off!

29:41.345 --> 29:43.074
We're sorry!

29:43.147 --> 29:45.115
Yeah. Real sorry.

29:45.182 --> 29:47.047
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:47.118 --> 29:49.052
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:49.120 --> 29:52.647
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:52.723 --> 29:54.714
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:54.792 --> 29:56.225
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:56.293 --> 29:57.885
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:57.962 --> 29:59.520
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

29:59.597 --> 30:02.566
Intruders must leave
seminole country.

30:02.633 --> 30:04.396
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

30:04.468 --> 30:06.060
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

30:06.137 --> 30:08.071
So get out of Florida.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.800
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

30:09.874 --> 30:11.569
<i>Namaho rehekiyo.</i>

30:11.642 --> 30:13.075
Wait a minute!

30:13.144 --> 30:17.103
<i>Asha-ha kai-es</i>
<i>nahu shahu laha!</i>

30:19.517 --> 30:22.577
Lewis, I don't think
those guys are Indians.

30:22.653 --> 30:25.588
When I said, "bite my crank,"
in Seminole,

30:25.656 --> 30:27.351
No one
responded.

30:27.424 --> 30:30.484
You said that
to these guys?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.433
My blouse!

30:49.680 --> 30:50.874
Nerds!

30:50.948 --> 30:53.143
- Ogre!
- Ogre!

30:55.753 --> 30:57.118
Don't go anywhere!

30:57.188 --> 30:59.122
I'm gonna kill you guys!

30:59.190 --> 31:00.248
Geeks!

31:26.684 --> 31:28.379
Oh, my!

31:28.452 --> 31:30.079
Look at that.

31:30.154 --> 31:32.088
We're trying
to eat here.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.623
Look, honey.
Nerds.

31:33.691 --> 31:36.251
Are any of those
our waiter?

31:36.393 --> 31:39.123
Hitchhiking five hours
without a ride!

31:39.196 --> 31:42.597
Would you pick up five guys
in their underwear?

31:42.666 --> 31:44.293
At least we're home.

31:44.368 --> 31:46.302
I've never been
so humiliated

31:46.370 --> 31:47.803
in all my life.

31:47.871 --> 31:51.830
Lewis, you must be crazy
to think we'll stay here.

31:51.909 --> 31:56.107
I'm going home, where I can
not get laid in peace.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.149
No. We were chosen
to represent Adams College.

31:59.216 --> 32:01.116
We'll stay
and represent them.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.585
Last year,
we were messed with.

32:03.654 --> 32:07.613
We fought back and won.
We can do it again.

32:07.691 --> 32:11.095
That was adams.
This is the real world!

32:11.228 --> 32:15.096
I don't know about you,
but I'm not giving up.

32:40.858 --> 32:43.258
Two for one.

32:47.164 --> 32:50.133
I'm really sorry
I snapped at you guys.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.134
- It's all r...
- Oh, Lewis...

32:52.202 --> 32:53.965
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

32:54.037 --> 32:55.629
- Lewis...
- Lewis...

32:55.706 --> 32:57.105
Guys!

32:57.174 --> 32:58.641
Lewis...

32:58.709 --> 33:00.370
we're really sorry.

33:00.444 --> 33:03.072
We're not going to
quit on you.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.580
Are we, guys?

33:04.648 --> 33:05.740
No.

33:05.816 --> 33:06.908
No.

33:06.984 --> 33:07.973
No.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.485
All right!

33:28.172 --> 33:30.902
This room
is a pigsty.

33:30.974 --> 33:32.669
Thank you.

33:39.850 --> 33:42.944
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

33:43.020 --> 33:46.319
Fuck you. Who died
and made you God?

33:53.163 --> 33:55.256
My name's Dudley Dawson.

33:55.332 --> 33:58.130
They call me... Booger.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.102
Edgar Poe Wong.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.434
They call me Snotty.

34:57.194 --> 34:58.525
Master!

35:03.133 --> 35:04.930
My son.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.936
Soon you will
take over.

35:10.707 --> 35:14.074
Those geeks look dumber
in their underwear than in person.

35:15.445 --> 35:18.243
In my day,
butt-wipes like that

35:18.315 --> 35:21.011
couldn't even get
in fraternities.

35:21.084 --> 35:24.520
College was drinking beer, playing
football, and getting laid.

35:24.588 --> 35:26.579
None of this
academic shit.

35:26.657 --> 35:29.820
I turned out just fine...
A hotel manager.

35:29.893 --> 35:31.485
Whoa!

35:31.561 --> 35:34.928
At least you guys
got rid of those geeks.

35:34.998 --> 35:36.431
Hear, hear, fellas.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.162
Here's to
the last of the nerds.

35:39.236 --> 35:41.704
Nerds!

35:41.772 --> 35:45.572
I don't care what kind of convention
the hotel has.

35:45.642 --> 35:47.576
I didn't sleep last night.

35:47.644 --> 35:49.578
There was screaming,
carrying on.

35:49.646 --> 35:52.114
We thought
we heard sheep noises.

35:52.182 --> 35:55.208
Why don't I do this...

35:55.285 --> 35:58.118
Would you hand me
a complimentary pass?

35:58.188 --> 36:01.123
This is a certificate
for a free night

36:01.191 --> 36:03.887
the next time
you stay with us.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.054
All right. But that
doesn't excuse it.

36:07.130 --> 36:09.724
I thought I heard
power tools.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.392
I'm very,
very sorry.

36:11.468 --> 36:13.800
Enjoy the rest
of your stay.

36:15.472 --> 36:18.339
What's this
about a free night?

36:18.408 --> 36:21.434
I thought because
they were having a hard...

36:21.511 --> 36:23.911
I'm not paying you
to think,

36:23.980 --> 36:27.472
unless you want it
taken out of your paycheck?

36:27.551 --> 36:30.850
Get it?
So get your ass back to work.

36:39.029 --> 36:40.860
That was rude, sir.

36:40.931 --> 36:43.559
Lipsey, you dipshit.

36:43.633 --> 36:45.692
I think you should
apologize!

36:45.769 --> 36:46.736
What?

36:46.803 --> 36:48.634
Oooh!

36:50.507 --> 36:52.099
Safe!

36:52.175 --> 36:54.234
Say, uh...

36:54.311 --> 36:55.505
Stewart.

36:55.579 --> 36:57.444
What are you doin'?

36:57.514 --> 36:59.209
Standing up for myself.

36:59.282 --> 37:00.442
I'll help.

37:00.517 --> 37:02.109
Oh, Stewart!

37:02.185 --> 37:04.153
Hi!

37:04.221 --> 37:05.916
How's your stroke?

37:05.989 --> 37:09.516
Mr. Skolnick!
Did you find a place to stay?

37:09.593 --> 37:13.393
You can call me at
the Hotel Coral Essex.

37:13.463 --> 37:15.192
I mean you...

37:15.265 --> 37:16.732
Stewart, are you okay?

37:16.800 --> 37:19.200
Thanks for
standing up for me.

37:19.269 --> 37:21.237
I guess you got fired.

37:21.304 --> 37:22.396
Yeah.

37:22.472 --> 37:23.905
Who fired you?

37:23.974 --> 37:25.441
The manager.

37:25.509 --> 37:26.999
The <i>acting</i> manager.

37:29.813 --> 37:30.973
Men.

37:32.616 --> 37:34.083
Just us three.

37:34.151 --> 37:35.209
Nerds!

37:35.285 --> 37:37.446
Debbie, there's
plenty of room.

37:37.521 --> 37:38.954
Yeah.

37:39.022 --> 37:41.217
The seats go down.
Sure.

37:41.291 --> 37:44.089
Don't forget
the blueberries and cream.

37:46.029 --> 37:48.156
You the manager here?

37:48.231 --> 37:49.289
Yeah.

37:49.366 --> 37:51.300
Skolnick, come here.

37:51.368 --> 37:52.858
Grrr.

37:55.038 --> 37:57.302
Skolnick,
you're a smart guy.

37:57.374 --> 38:00.468
Don't you understand?
Don't you get the message?

38:00.544 --> 38:02.375
You're not wanted here.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.914
Wrong. Adams College
wants us here.

38:04.981 --> 38:07.142
We are their chosen
delegates.

38:07.217 --> 38:09.913
We have a right
to be here, sir.

38:09.986 --> 38:11.749
Tell them,
Poindexter.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.517
You are correct, Lamar.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.423
According to the bylaws
of the United Fraternities,

38:16.493 --> 38:19.929
all representatives qualified
to represent represented organizations

38:19.996 --> 38:23.056
are allowed <i>by law</i>
their rightful place.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.868
So bite me.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.404
No! Fine.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.939
You're right.

38:30.006 --> 38:31.940
You're
absolutely right.

38:32.008 --> 38:34.943
If that's the law,
then...

38:35.011 --> 38:36.672
that's the law.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.452
So we are resolved

38:42.519 --> 38:45.454
to extend the reach
of our domain

38:45.522 --> 38:47.922
to include technical
and trade schools

38:47.991 --> 38:49.959
and English-speaking
universities

38:50.026 --> 38:51.960
outside of the country.

38:52.028 --> 38:55.293
Now to our last order
of business,

38:55.365 --> 38:57.765
which concerns
constitutional amendments

38:57.834 --> 39:00.803
which will be voted on
at tomorrow's session.

39:00.871 --> 39:04.398
Uh... Proposition 15,
sponsored by the Alpha Betas,

39:04.474 --> 39:08.035
will be introduced
by Chip "Tiny" Hayes.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.080
Excuse me.

39:20.156 --> 39:23.956
Uh, Chip
"The Meat" Hayes.

39:26.897 --> 39:29.957
Oh, my God.
Dreamin', man.

39:30.033 --> 39:33.400
Whereas it is a moral obligation
of every fraternity

39:33.470 --> 39:36.928
to glorify both the body
as well as the mind,

39:37.007 --> 39:40.909
be it now resolved
that all fraternities shall...

39:40.977 --> 39:42.968
shall ag...

39:43.046 --> 39:44.274
Augment.

39:44.347 --> 39:45.405
Thanks.

39:45.482 --> 39:47.609
Augment existing
academic standards

39:47.684 --> 39:51.176
with new physical
standards as well.

39:51.254 --> 39:52.653
- What?
- What?

39:52.722 --> 39:54.053
Unconstitutional!

39:54.124 --> 39:55.455
That bites.

39:55.525 --> 39:57.720
Therefore each fraternity's
membership

39:57.794 --> 39:59.728
must meet
such physical standards

39:59.796 --> 40:02.196
or be excluded
from this conference.

40:02.265 --> 40:03.357
Thank you.

40:04.701 --> 40:06.760
Who decides the standards?

40:06.836 --> 40:08.269
Pardon me?

40:08.338 --> 40:10.829
I said, who decides
the standards?

40:10.907 --> 40:14.206
Why, your, uh...

40:14.277 --> 40:17.838
your democratically
elected leaders, of course.

40:21.251 --> 40:23.586
Do I hear a second?

40:23.719 --> 40:25.380
Get those nerds out.

40:25.454 --> 40:26.944
I second it!

40:27.022 --> 40:28.489
Uh-uh.

40:28.557 --> 40:31.890
Proposition 15
is moved and seconded

40:31.961 --> 40:35.453
and will be voted
on tomorrow's ballot.

40:35.531 --> 40:38.830
They can kick us out
if we don't pass.

40:38.901 --> 40:40.334
We're screwed.

40:40.402 --> 40:44.498
No, we're not. They're not
getting away with this.

40:44.573 --> 40:47.474
Point of order!
This is totally unfair!

40:47.543 --> 40:49.511
I'll give you the mike

40:49.578 --> 40:52.741
as soon as I make
this brief announcement.

40:52.815 --> 40:55.010
Make it quick.

40:55.084 --> 40:59.919
Gentlemen, Wet Nightie contest
poolside in five minutes.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.864
Wet nightie, whoa!

41:15.871 --> 41:19.807
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

41:22.911 --> 41:26.779
We got 24 hours
to get through to these people.

41:26.849 --> 41:28.282
But how?

41:28.350 --> 41:29.977
They're rational
individuals.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.816
All we have to do
is explain

41:32.888 --> 41:36.221
that Proposition 15
is unfair and inappropriate.

41:46.568 --> 41:47.762
Guys.

41:47.836 --> 41:50.066
Looking
at women like that!

41:50.139 --> 41:51.834
You're just a kid.

41:51.907 --> 41:54.171
Should be
ashamed of yourself.

41:54.243 --> 41:57.303
We're going to have to
fight fire with fire.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.870
I agree.
Let's torch their hotel.

41:59.948 --> 42:02.178
No. Beat them
at their game.

42:02.251 --> 42:03.218
Football?

42:03.285 --> 42:07.312
We should have
a No-On-15 party. Right?

42:07.389 --> 42:08.686
Right.

42:08.757 --> 42:11.624
The Tri-Lambs can prevail
in Fort Lauderdale.

42:15.497 --> 42:16.964
Wormser.

42:17.032 --> 42:18.465
Here.

42:18.534 --> 42:20.934
If this doesn't
get a crowd,

42:21.003 --> 42:23.938
I don't know
what will.

42:24.006 --> 42:25.473
Hit the switch.

42:25.541 --> 42:26.974
Hit the switch.

42:27.042 --> 42:28.475
Hit the switch.

42:28.544 --> 42:30.136
Hit the switch!

42:30.212 --> 42:31.543
Hit the switch!

42:33.682 --> 42:35.149
All right!

42:35.217 --> 42:37.481
You guys,
that worked great!

42:37.553 --> 42:40.215
I don't get it.

42:50.032 --> 42:51.522
<i>Ave Maria!</i>

42:51.600 --> 42:54.569
Party!

43:00.242 --> 43:03.405
Oh, thank you, God,
for my five little babies.

43:03.479 --> 43:05.276
It's party time!

43:05.347 --> 43:07.008
Hit it!

43:16.024 --> 43:18.515
# Party people in the place,
here's the story #

43:18.594 --> 43:20.755
#About some guys
that are bound for glory #

43:20.829 --> 43:23.354
# I'll get right down
to the nit-ty gritty #

43:23.432 --> 43:24.831
#The Triple-L Crew is gonna #

43:24.900 --> 43:26.333
- # Rock this city! #
- # Rock this city! #

43:26.401 --> 43:28.266
# I'm the L-A-M,
the "A" and the "R" #

43:28.337 --> 43:30.532
#The man on the mike
that they call Lamar #

43:30.606 --> 43:32.870
#And there's a couple of things
that I'd like to say #

43:32.941 --> 43:34.135
#About Prop 15 #

43:34.209 --> 43:35.540
- # It's not okay! #
- # It's not okay! #

43:35.611 --> 43:38.011
# Now, I'm no jock,
no football hero #

43:38.080 --> 43:40.640
# But that don't mean
I'm a absolute zero #

43:45.387 --> 43:47.947
# Now, people call us rejects
and all of that stuff #

43:48.023 --> 43:50.150
#Just because
we can't do 100 pushups #

43:50.225 --> 43:52.989
# Don't judge by looks,
like a book by its cover #

43:53.061 --> 43:55.393
#You may miss a friend,
You may miss a lover #

44:05.174 --> 44:07.438
# I'm rockin' on the mike,
I didn't come to preach #

44:07.509 --> 44:09.807
#There's some folks out there
who need to be reached #

44:09.878 --> 44:12.403
#You gotta open your mind
so you can set it free #

44:12.481 --> 44:15.382
#And the man to help you do it
is the mighty Lipsey #

44:15.450 --> 44:17.111
<i>#Ka-pow! Ka-pow!</i>
<i>K- k-k-pow! #</i>

44:17.186 --> 44:18.983
#The mighty Lipsey #

44:19.054 --> 44:20.112
# K-sey #

44:20.189 --> 44:22.180
<i>#K-k-k-k-pow! #</i>

44:32.000 --> 44:33.467
Kick it!

44:33.535 --> 44:35.594
# My name is Lipsey,
and I got somethin' to say #

44:35.671 --> 44:38.139
# I got a couple of myths
that I'd like to slay #

44:38.207 --> 44:40.471
#We're not really meek
like an itty-bitty mouse #

44:40.542 --> 44:43.136
#And in case you're uninformed,
we came to rock the house! #

44:43.212 --> 44:45.305
#There's only one question
that I got for you #

44:45.380 --> 44:46.540
#And that's
"who are you?" #

44:46.615 --> 44:47.775
# I'm somebody, too! #

44:52.487 --> 44:55.081
- # Some people into art #
- # Some are really smart #

44:55.157 --> 44:56.488
# Some got
a head start #

44:56.558 --> 44:58.025
# It doesn't mean
we're worlds apart #

44:58.093 --> 45:00.254
# Some people think
we're for the birds #

45:00.329 --> 45:01.455
#And then
they call us names #

45:01.530 --> 45:02.622
#They call us nerds #

45:07.703 --> 45:09.898
# Ner-vous is what
they really are #

45:09.972 --> 45:11.337
#Judgin' themselves #

45:11.406 --> 45:12.430
# By the make
of their car #

45:12.507 --> 45:14.270
#We're not dogs #
# Not jerks #

45:14.343 --> 45:15.867
- # Not wimps #
- # Not geeks #

45:15.944 --> 45:17.411
- # Not losers #
- # Failures #
- # Fakes or freaks #

45:17.479 --> 45:19.947
# Now, you may have clothes,
you may have money #

45:20.015 --> 45:23.212
#A def set of wheels,
and a good-lookin' honey #

45:23.285 --> 45:24.650
#Well, I ain't got threads
or a Mercedes-Benz #

45:24.720 --> 45:27.280
# But at least I have got
some really good friends #

45:27.356 --> 45:29.722
# So don't diss us,
don't dismiss us #

45:29.791 --> 45:31.952
# 'Cause one day
you might want to kiss us #

45:32.027 --> 45:33.392
# Don't reject us #

45:33.462 --> 45:34.429
# Disrespect us #

45:34.496 --> 45:36.691
#We will not let you
neglect us #

45:39.134 --> 45:41.796
# So before we go,
take a final note #

45:41.870 --> 45:44.634
# No on 15
is the way to vote #

45:44.706 --> 45:46.936
# No on 15! #

45:47.009 --> 45:49.569
# No on 15! #

45:49.645 --> 45:51.738
# No on 15! #

45:51.813 --> 45:53.508
# No on 15! ##

45:56.318 --> 45:57.649
Thank you!

45:57.719 --> 46:00.153
How are you
going to vote?

46:00.222 --> 46:01.985
No on 15!

46:02.057 --> 46:03.922
What on 15?

46:03.992 --> 46:05.926
No on 15!

46:05.994 --> 46:09.020
No on 15!

46:09.097 --> 46:10.689
No on 15!

46:10.766 --> 46:12.393
No on 15!

46:12.467 --> 46:13.900
We're serious now.

46:13.969 --> 46:15.937
We really mean it.

46:16.004 --> 46:17.403
No on 15!

46:17.472 --> 46:18.939
Make some noise!

46:19.007 --> 46:20.941
No on 15!

46:21.009 --> 46:22.442
No on 15!

46:22.511 --> 46:24.274
No on 15!

46:24.346 --> 46:26.143
No on 15!

46:26.214 --> 46:27.841
No on 15!

46:35.524 --> 46:38.618
I guess I underestimated
these guys.

46:38.727 --> 46:40.957
Motion is carried.

46:41.029 --> 46:44.965
Proposition 15 is hereby
removed from the agenda

46:45.033 --> 46:47.399
and is rendered moot.

46:47.469 --> 46:48.993
They actually did it.

46:49.071 --> 46:51.835
Maybe the Alphas
aren't such bad guys.

46:51.907 --> 46:55.468
Now I have one final
order of business.

46:55.544 --> 46:57.444
Could Lewis Skolnick,

46:57.512 --> 47:02.245
president of the Adams College
chapter of Lambda Lambda Lambda,

47:02.317 --> 47:04.979
come up to the podium, please?

47:07.389 --> 47:08.913
You should go.

47:08.991 --> 47:10.424
Go!

47:10.492 --> 47:11.925
To make certain

47:11.994 --> 47:14.428
this organization
is never again embarrassed

47:14.496 --> 47:17.897
by such misguided deeds
as the Alphas are guilty of,

47:17.966 --> 47:21.402
I hereby propose the following
constitutional amendment...

47:21.470 --> 47:23.097
Henceforth, any fraternity

47:23.171 --> 47:26.072
guilty of illegal
or improper conduct

47:26.141 --> 47:29.406
shall be expelled from
the United Fraternity Conference

47:29.478 --> 47:31.946
and their national charter
revoked.

47:32.014 --> 47:35.916
Lewis, I'd like the record
here today to reflect

47:35.984 --> 47:39.852
that we introduced
this proposition together.

47:40.989 --> 47:42.354
Okay, Rog.

47:43.992 --> 47:46.290
Let's officially
bury the hatchet

47:46.361 --> 47:48.420
between the Tri-Lambs
and the Alphas

47:48.497 --> 47:51.466
and put this joint amendment
to a vote.

47:51.533 --> 47:54.263
I think
I'm gonna cry.

47:57.039 --> 47:58.973
All those in favor...

47:59.041 --> 48:01.703
- Aye!
- Aye!
- Aye!

48:12.954 --> 48:14.421
Hey, guys.

48:14.489 --> 48:17.822
Here you are, fellas.
It's all yours.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.901
I know it must be
kind of overwhelming.

48:28.970 --> 48:33.930
But we just wanted you guys
to know how sorry we were.

48:34.008 --> 48:37.444
Lewis, I hate
to use "party" as a verb,

48:37.512 --> 48:40.948
but you guys can really party.
We were impressed.

48:41.015 --> 48:42.346
Yeah.

48:46.621 --> 48:50.022
God, you know, Rog,
we must be dreaming!

48:52.026 --> 48:55.359
Nah. If we were dreaming,
I'd have a boner.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.433
A boner!

49:06.741 --> 49:08.902
To truly hock a loogie,

49:08.977 --> 49:13.880
one must not retrieve
the phlegm from the throat,

49:13.948 --> 49:15.813
but from the soul.

49:18.486 --> 49:21.421
God, Gilbert,
I really wish you were here.

49:21.489 --> 49:24.549
The Alphas down here
are so great.

49:24.625 --> 49:27.423
You're telling me
that they called you up,

49:27.495 --> 49:30.396
they invited you over
to their hotel,

49:30.465 --> 49:33.400
and then
they gave you their suite?

49:33.468 --> 49:35.060
Yeah. It's incredible.

49:35.136 --> 49:36.728
It's too incredible.

49:36.804 --> 49:38.431
Lewis, I know you.

49:38.506 --> 49:41.407
Sometimes you're so eager
to be liked

49:41.476 --> 49:43.944
that you don't take the time

49:44.012 --> 49:46.776
to see people
for who they really are.

49:46.848 --> 49:49.783
Are you saying
I'm some kind of weenie

49:49.851 --> 49:52.251
who can't take care
of himself?

49:52.320 --> 49:54.345
I want you
to be careful.

49:54.422 --> 49:57.448
Remember, once an Alpha,
always an Alpha.

49:58.993 --> 50:00.358
Sorry.

50:00.428 --> 50:03.124
Hey, Boog, let's go.

50:17.912 --> 50:19.504
Ahh, now, my son,

50:19.580 --> 50:22.743
you are ready to go out
into the world.

50:26.854 --> 50:29.118
Awesome, Booger.

50:31.592 --> 50:33.958
And don't forget
the whipped cream.

50:34.028 --> 50:38.124
So you guys just get the nerds
into my car... alone.

50:38.199 --> 50:40.667
I'll take care
of the rest.

50:40.735 --> 50:42.168
Understand?

50:42.236 --> 50:44.670
- Yo.
- You bet.

50:46.140 --> 50:47.471
Sir?

50:47.542 --> 50:49.976
I have
a job for you.

50:50.044 --> 50:52.979
Mr. Lattimore will
explain it to you.

50:53.047 --> 50:54.674
Sunny, I feel terrible

50:54.749 --> 50:57.684
about the way
I treated the Tri-Lambs.

50:57.752 --> 51:01.188
I thought maybe
you guys could take them out

51:01.255 --> 51:04.122
and... I don't know...
show them a good time.

51:04.192 --> 51:06.717
Actually,
you could use my car.

51:06.794 --> 51:09.627
That's awfully sweet
of you, but...

51:09.697 --> 51:12.291
I mean
I have to work.

51:12.366 --> 51:13.958
Part of your job

51:14.035 --> 51:16.469
is taking care
of the customers.

51:16.537 --> 51:19.335
They're important.
I want to make them happy.

51:19.407 --> 51:20.874
You what?

51:20.942 --> 51:23.467
Earlier, I erred
in my judgment.

51:23.544 --> 51:26.775
These Tri-Lambs
are... good nerds.

51:26.848 --> 51:28.475
Men.

51:28.549 --> 51:31.712
Look, just do
your job, will you?

51:31.786 --> 51:33.378
Yes, sir.

51:35.957 --> 51:38.391
And, uh... Sunny...

51:41.562 --> 51:43.655
have a good time, okay?

51:43.731 --> 51:45.392
Yes, sir.

51:46.801 --> 51:48.393
Bye-bye.

51:50.905 --> 51:52.497
You know, guys,

51:52.573 --> 51:55.007
Gilbert, Jefferson,
all our brothers

51:55.076 --> 51:57.977
are going to be
so proud of us.

51:58.045 --> 51:59.603
Gents.

51:59.680 --> 52:03.514
Uh-oh. I think
we're in their seats, guys.

52:03.584 --> 52:07.418
No. It looks like
they're comin' to talk to us.

52:07.488 --> 52:09.115
Whatever's
in this drink,

52:09.190 --> 52:11.249
I want to order
a case.

52:11.325 --> 52:13.520
It's not the drinks.
It's us.

52:13.594 --> 52:16.620
You see, we're winners,
and it shows.

52:16.697 --> 52:18.096
Shall we?

52:18.166 --> 52:19.633
What? Jump Them?

52:19.700 --> 52:22.635
Talk to them.
Find out what they like...

52:22.703 --> 52:24.466
what they're
thinking about...

52:24.539 --> 52:26.734
What they look like
naked...

52:26.807 --> 52:28.468
if she's got
a brother...

52:28.543 --> 52:30.170
how long
they've been listening.

52:31.846 --> 52:33.211
Hi, Sunny.

52:33.281 --> 52:35.476
- Hello again.
- Hi.
- Yo.

52:35.550 --> 52:36.812
Nice day.

52:36.884 --> 52:38.351
- Wow.
- Beautiful.
- Yo.

52:38.419 --> 52:39.784
Paradise.

52:39.854 --> 52:41.981
It is.

52:42.056 --> 52:43.887
- You bet.
- Yo.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.954
You wanna get funky or what?

52:53.301 --> 52:55.166
<i># Won't you take me to #</i>

52:55.236 --> 52:56.669
<i>#Funky Town? #</i>

52:56.737 --> 52:58.671
<i># Won't you take me to #</i>

52:58.739 --> 53:00.536
<i>#Funky Town? #</i>

53:00.608 --> 53:02.576
<i># Won't you take me to #</i>

53:02.643 --> 53:04.406

53:04.478 --> 53:06.275
<i># Won't you take me to #</i>

53:06.347 --> 53:07.712
<i>#Funky Town? #</i>

53:33.174 --> 53:34.664
Lewis?

53:34.742 --> 53:38.473
Would you rub some
of this lotion on my back?

53:38.546 --> 53:39.979
Yeah.

53:40.047 --> 53:42.106
<i># Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout,</i>
<i>talkin' 'bout it #</i>

53:45.052 --> 53:48.886

53:51.525 --> 53:53.288
What are
you doing?

53:53.361 --> 53:54.487
Nothing.

53:54.562 --> 53:55.893
Absolutely nothing.

53:58.566 --> 54:00.466
<i># Gotta move on ##</i>

54:00.534 --> 54:04.937
Well... actually, the truth
of the matter is, Sunny...

54:05.006 --> 54:07.406
I'm a little nervous.

54:07.475 --> 54:08.942
Nervous?

54:09.010 --> 54:10.944
Yeah. I mean...

54:11.012 --> 54:14.948
I'm not really
the cool dude I seem to be.

54:15.016 --> 54:16.916
Oh, no?

54:16.984 --> 54:18.451
Uh-uh.

54:18.519 --> 54:20.248
I mean
I've never...

54:20.321 --> 54:24.280
really rubbed lotion
on anybody except, uh...

54:24.358 --> 54:26.383
Poindexter there.

54:26.460 --> 54:28.121
I can't believe this.

54:28.195 --> 54:29.219
What?

54:29.297 --> 54:32.130
Uh... rubbing lotion...
on a girl who, uh...

54:32.199 --> 54:35.760
could date anybody she wanted
in the entire state of Florida.

54:35.836 --> 54:37.770
I don't date
that much.

54:37.838 --> 54:39.305
Get out of town!

54:39.373 --> 54:42.433
Guys like Roger
ask you out all the time.

54:42.510 --> 54:45.479
Guys like Roger
barely have enough glial cells

54:45.546 --> 54:47.480
to be considered
primates.

54:47.548 --> 54:49.448
Sometimes
it's the shyer guys

54:49.517 --> 54:52.179
you wish
would ask you out.

54:52.253 --> 54:53.720
Glial cells?

54:53.788 --> 54:55.483
I'm speaking facetiously.

54:55.556 --> 54:58.491
Everybody knows glial cells
aren't measured in quantity,

54:58.559 --> 55:01.687
but in ratio to neurons
in the parietal lobe.

55:01.762 --> 55:03.627
Sunny, you're amazing.

55:05.566 --> 55:09.969
Guys, we're thirsty.
You want to get us some brewski?

55:10.037 --> 55:12.870
Yeah! We'll get you
some brews!

55:12.940 --> 55:17.104
Sunny, want to kill off
some excess glial cells?

55:17.178 --> 55:18.611
Okay.

55:18.679 --> 55:21.079
Guys, come on!
Beer run!

55:21.148 --> 55:22.240
Aah!

55:22.316 --> 55:23.340
Mmm!

55:29.023 --> 55:33.050
Don't worry. We'll be gone
in no time.

55:33.127 --> 55:34.719
What do you mean?

55:36.230 --> 55:39.131
# 4,749,681,999 bottles
of beer on the wall #

55:39.166 --> 55:42.032
# 4,749,681,999 bottles
of beer on the wall #

55:42.102 --> 55:47.438
# 4,749,681,999
bottles of beer #

55:47.507 --> 55:49.839
# If one of those bottles
should happen to fall #

55:49.910 --> 55:54.711
# 4,749,681,998 bottles
of beer on the wall ##

56:03.990 --> 56:06.584
Okay, you guys,
you get the suds.

56:06.660 --> 56:09.322
I got to go
drain the lizard.

56:11.498 --> 56:13.159
Get some chips,
Poindexter.

56:17.471 --> 56:19.496
Anything you want,
Admiral.

56:29.716 --> 56:31.479
I got beer!

56:31.552 --> 56:32.814
Freeze!

56:32.886 --> 56:34.080
Busted!

56:34.154 --> 56:35.451
Hands up!

56:35.522 --> 56:37.490
You're under arrest.

56:37.558 --> 56:38.991
For what?

56:39.059 --> 56:40.993
Grand theft auto.

56:41.061 --> 56:44.497
Roger Lattimore reported
this vehicle stolen this morning.

56:44.565 --> 56:46.499
No, that's
a misunderstanding.

56:46.567 --> 56:50.196
Three beautiful girls
lent us that car.

56:50.270 --> 56:51.965
Beautiful girls?

56:52.039 --> 56:53.904
Get your hands up!

57:02.082 --> 57:03.982
Let's go, fellas.

57:04.051 --> 57:05.484
Come on!

57:05.552 --> 57:07.520
We're winners,
You say.

57:07.588 --> 57:09.522
Okay,
so I'm stupid.

57:09.590 --> 57:11.990
What does that
make you?

57:12.059 --> 57:13.526
A felon.

57:13.594 --> 57:15.084
Right here.

57:17.064 --> 57:20.033
No, I'm only 15.
I'm a kid.

57:20.100 --> 57:23.194
That's not what
it says here, Senator.

57:26.807 --> 57:27.967
Damn!

57:28.041 --> 57:30.475
I gotta get out
of here.

57:30.544 --> 57:34.378
Damn race is going off
in half an hour.

57:37.017 --> 57:38.951
I liked her.

57:39.019 --> 57:40.987
I actually believed her.

57:41.054 --> 57:44.990
I was thinking,
"This beautiful girl likes you."

57:45.058 --> 57:47.993
You were thinking
with the wrong head.

57:48.061 --> 57:50.655
There's something
of greater importance here.

57:50.731 --> 57:52.494
Yeah, like what?

57:52.566 --> 57:55.000
It's gonna be
a bit inconvenient

57:55.068 --> 57:56.865
finishing college
from jail.

57:56.937 --> 57:58.928
I studied hard
this year.

57:59.006 --> 58:01.634
You know what
occurred to me?

58:01.708 --> 58:03.835
The amendment
Lewis cosigned

58:03.911 --> 58:05.936
could destroy
the Tri-Lambs.

58:06.013 --> 58:08.481
Gosh darn it
to heck.

58:08.549 --> 58:11.245
Do you mind?
I'm cursing.

58:11.318 --> 58:12.615
Back off!

58:12.686 --> 58:14.847
We're speaking quietly
amongst ourselves.

58:14.922 --> 58:16.913
It doesn't
pertain to you.

58:16.990 --> 58:19.083
What will we tell
Dean Yewlett?

58:19.159 --> 58:20.626
Listen, you geek!

58:20.694 --> 58:22.525
Listen,
butt-face!

58:22.596 --> 58:24.962
I'm in no mood
for this!

58:25.032 --> 58:26.966
Why don't you
sit down

58:27.034 --> 58:29.093
before you really
make me mad!

58:33.340 --> 58:35.137
Do you realize

58:35.209 --> 58:37.143
you just said
"butt-face"

58:37.211 --> 58:38.940
to the missing
link?

58:39.012 --> 58:40.445
I did?

58:40.514 --> 58:42.448
And really
loud, too.

58:42.516 --> 58:45.144
No more nerds!

58:45.219 --> 58:47.813
No more nerds!

58:47.888 --> 58:49.446
No more nerds!

58:49.523 --> 58:51.286
No more nerds!

58:51.358 --> 58:52.882
No more nerds!

58:52.960 --> 58:54.791
No more nerds!

58:54.861 --> 58:56.590
No more nerds!

58:56.663 --> 58:58.153
Yo, yo, yo.

58:58.232 --> 59:00.632
I'm looking
for my homeboys.

59:00.701 --> 59:03.295
Looks like
you got us instead.

59:03.370 --> 59:06.396
I thought we were
getting rid of them.

59:06.473 --> 59:08.498
Yeah, so did i.

59:08.575 --> 59:11.976
What did you do
with the Tri-Lambdas?

59:12.045 --> 59:14.172
What did
you say, nerd?

59:14.248 --> 59:16.182
Tell me
what you did,

59:16.250 --> 59:18.081
or you're
in big trouble.

59:18.151 --> 59:19.743
Big trouble!

59:21.221 --> 59:22.688
Fellas, relax.

59:22.756 --> 59:24.348
Come here, Stewart.

59:24.424 --> 59:25.482
You're right.

59:27.027 --> 59:28.927
It's really
very sad.

59:28.996 --> 59:30.930
What are you
talking about?

59:30.998 --> 59:33.466
The guys
are all in jail.

59:33.533 --> 59:34.966
What?

59:35.035 --> 59:36.935
Yeah, they stole
my car.

59:37.004 --> 59:38.972
They stole your car?

59:39.039 --> 59:41.439
You wanna know
the saddest part?

59:41.508 --> 59:44.443
They're about to get
their whole fraternity

59:44.511 --> 59:46.479
thrown out
of the conference.

59:46.546 --> 59:48.480
What do you mean?

59:48.548 --> 59:51.312
Ogre, didn't he
call you a homo?

59:51.385 --> 59:52.443
Homo?

59:57.024 --> 59:59.288
Hey! We got
a problem here!

59:59.359 --> 01:00:01.691
I thought I fired you!

01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:06.589
Nerd.

01:00:08.035 --> 01:00:09.900
My God, what happened?

01:00:15.075 --> 01:00:17.009
We're in trouble.

01:00:17.077 --> 01:00:18.510
What's wrong?

01:00:18.578 --> 01:00:20.978
The Tri-Lambs
stole a car.

01:00:21.048 --> 01:00:23.016
They're thrown
in jail.

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:25.415
My friends wouldn't
have done that.

01:00:25.485 --> 01:00:27.453
Who told you this?

01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:28.419
Them.

01:00:28.488 --> 01:00:29.921
Good shot.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.958
Here's a problem

01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:33.959
that just won't
go away.

01:00:34.027 --> 01:00:35.961
Just like
my crabs.

01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:38.623
What?

01:00:38.699 --> 01:00:40.929
Let's go finish
these geeks off.

01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:42.969
Guys, it's
just a joke.

01:00:43.036 --> 01:00:45.470
You guys,
I don't have crabs.

01:00:45.539 --> 01:00:48.872
I'll show you
if you wanna see.

01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:55.947
So long, suckers!

01:00:56.016 --> 01:00:58.314
You guys
all right?

01:00:58.385 --> 01:01:00.717
How was
doing hard time?

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:04.120
How did you get
money for bail?

01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:05.488
She did.

01:01:09.129 --> 01:01:10.596
You?

01:01:10.664 --> 01:01:12.359
I'm sorry.

01:01:12.432 --> 01:01:14.195
I swear I didn't know.

01:01:14.267 --> 01:01:15.734
Lewis, wait!

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:18.066
I say
we fight back now.

01:01:18.138 --> 01:01:20.072
It doesn't matter
anymore.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.074
They'll find
another way

01:01:22.142 --> 01:01:24.042
to get rid of us.

01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:25.976
They'll send
somebody like her.

01:01:26.046 --> 01:01:27.980
You're not worth
the lotion

01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:30.016
I squirted on you.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:31.846
I swear
I didn't know!

01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:32.976
Oh, I'm so sure.

01:01:33.053 --> 01:01:36.181
Just get in the van.

01:01:36.256 --> 01:01:39.020
We just don't
fit in.

01:01:39.092 --> 01:01:41.026
You sound
like I sounded

01:01:41.094 --> 01:01:43.790
before you
taught me to fight.

01:01:43.864 --> 01:01:45.855
Don't you
understand?

01:01:45.932 --> 01:01:48.992
It doesn't matter
that we're good dressers

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:52.300
or we have
good personal hygiene.

01:01:52.372 --> 01:01:54.203
Don't you get it?

01:01:54.274 --> 01:01:56.504
People don't
want us around.

01:01:56.576 --> 01:01:58.544
No shit, Skolnick.

01:01:58.612 --> 01:02:00.409
Surprise!

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.504
Ogre!

01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:03.310
Aah!

01:02:03.383 --> 01:02:05.749
Come on, let's go.

01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:07.047
Aah!

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.452
We gotta get out of here!

01:02:13.627 --> 01:02:16.858
Come on,
get him out here.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:18.522
Come on.

01:02:18.598 --> 01:02:20.532
Ogre, you swine!

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.068
You might have
brought us here,

01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:26.503
but I'm not staying
in that cabin anymore.

01:02:26.573 --> 01:02:28.006
Oh, yeah?

01:02:28.074 --> 01:02:29.166
Yeah!

01:02:29.242 --> 01:02:30.971
Ogre, Ogre,
the water.

01:02:31.044 --> 01:02:31.976
Right.

01:02:32.045 --> 01:02:32.909
Aah!

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.480
You guys are
unbelievable.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.984
We spared you,
didn't we?

01:02:39.052 --> 01:02:41.316
Aah!

01:02:41.388 --> 01:02:42.980
Aah!

01:02:43.056 --> 01:02:44.819
Aah!

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:48.418
Aah!

01:02:49.529 --> 01:02:52.020
Hope you like
living with fish!

01:02:52.098 --> 01:02:54.430
Have a nice swim!

01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:56.526
Let's get out
of here!

01:02:56.603 --> 01:02:58.036
No, wait.

01:02:58.104 --> 01:03:00.004
I'm getting
the hell out.

01:03:00.073 --> 01:03:01.438
Excuse me.

01:03:02.576 --> 01:03:04.009
Weird chick.

01:03:04.077 --> 01:03:05.510
Excuse me.

01:03:05.579 --> 01:03:07.444
What's with you?

01:03:10.116 --> 01:03:12.209
Hey, Sunny!

01:03:12.285 --> 01:03:15.311
Have fun
with the geeks!

01:03:15.388 --> 01:03:16.719
Hey, nerd!

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:18.724
We're gonna
miss you tomorrow

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:20.726
at the convention

01:03:20.794 --> 01:03:23.228
when we get
your asses exterminated!

01:03:24.731 --> 01:03:27.632
I can't wait
to tell <i>everybody</i>

01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:29.669
how we
outsmarted them,

01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:32.136
framed them,
and got them arrested

01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:34.173
for doing nothing!

01:03:34.241 --> 01:03:36.675
Ogre, listen and
try and understand.

01:03:36.743 --> 01:03:38.677
If you
tell them that,

01:03:38.745 --> 01:03:40.679
it's gonna
give us away.

01:03:40.747 --> 01:03:43.181
Let's keep it
our little secret.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.184
Secret, my ass.

01:03:45.252 --> 01:03:47.686
I can take care
of anything.

01:03:47.754 --> 01:03:49.745
Fellas,
he's history.

01:03:49.823 --> 01:03:51.188
History?

01:03:51.258 --> 01:03:52.589
No!

01:03:55.262 --> 01:03:56.695
Help!

01:03:56.763 --> 01:03:59.493
I can't swim!

01:03:59.566 --> 01:04:00.999
Man overboard!

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:03.092
Guys, Ogre's drowning.

01:04:03.169 --> 01:04:05.160
I'm drowning!

01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:07.172
Someone!

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.174
Help me!

01:04:09.242 --> 01:04:11.233
Come on!

01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:13.040
Help!

01:04:13.113 --> 01:04:15.172
I can't swim!

01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.716
Oh, God,
I'm sinking now!

01:04:17.784 --> 01:04:19.718
Help! Help!

01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:21.720
Oh, no!
I'm gonna die!

01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:23.722
I'm so young!

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:25.417
Oh, no!

01:04:25.492 --> 01:04:27.653
I'm gonna die!

01:04:27.727 --> 01:04:29.627
Ogre.
Ogre, just relax.

01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:31.163
Relax.

01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:34.667
Relax.
I'll pull you.

01:04:34.734 --> 01:04:36.634
You're a strong
little guy.

01:04:36.703 --> 01:04:38.938
Come on!
Swim faster!

01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:44.175
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

01:04:44.243 --> 01:04:46.677
I thought
I was gonna die.

01:04:46.745 --> 01:04:48.975
Boy, you're
a strong swimmer.

01:04:49.048 --> 01:04:50.982
Wow.

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:53.177
Let me go,
you fruit!

01:04:53.252 --> 01:04:55.152
I carried you
this far.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.984
Work your way in
on your own.

01:04:58.057 --> 01:04:59.752
I saved your life!

01:05:02.428 --> 01:05:04.658
See you
at the convention!

01:05:07.766 --> 01:05:09.666
You all right,
Harold?

01:05:09.735 --> 01:05:11.703
Piece of cake.

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:14.705
What are you geeks
looking at?

01:05:14.773 --> 01:05:17.674
Those guys
just dropped me off

01:05:17.743 --> 01:05:19.540
to nerd-sit.

01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:29.654
Boy, this is great.

01:05:29.722 --> 01:05:32.384
The perfect ending
of the Tri-Lambs.

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:34.653
Even on a deserted island,

01:05:34.727 --> 01:05:37.161
we got somebody
calling us "geeks".

01:05:37.229 --> 01:05:39.823
Oh, we're gonna
do great things

01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:41.832
at this convention.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.165
I don't know what the hell
I was thinking.

01:05:45.237 --> 01:05:47.171
We <i>are</i> geeks.

01:05:47.239 --> 01:05:49.173
I mean, look at us!

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:51.175
We're not like
anybody else,

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:53.143
and we never will be.

01:05:53.212 --> 01:05:54.577
Lewis!

01:05:56.415 --> 01:05:58.849
So what do we do now?

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:01.681
Maybe we should
build a fire.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:03.517
Split up.

01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:05.489
Let's find some wood.

01:06:05.557 --> 01:06:07.422
Come on, Worm.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.204
Don't even
get me started.

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:22.206
We're gonna be here

01:06:22.274 --> 01:06:24.105
till you're old
and gray.

01:06:25.778 --> 01:06:28.178
Damn Alpha Betas.

01:06:28.247 --> 01:06:30.613
Just my freaking luck.

01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:40.725
Bush.

01:06:40.793 --> 01:06:43.785
We've got bush!

01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:07.251
Do you guys mind if
I sit around here?

01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:09.753
It's getting cold
on the beach.

01:07:09.822 --> 01:07:11.653
Sure,
have a seat.

01:07:13.826 --> 01:07:15.657
Pull up
a chair.

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:38.340
Eh...

01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:41.617
Hey.

01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:48.623
Why not?

01:07:50.295 --> 01:07:52.286
You want a hit?

01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:53.558
Me?

01:07:53.632 --> 01:07:54.894
Yes, you.

01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:55.956
Sure.

01:08:03.809 --> 01:08:05.640
You don't mind?

01:08:15.854 --> 01:08:18.755
So what you're saying
essentially is,

01:08:18.823 --> 01:08:21.725
is that along
with infinite space,

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:24.694
which extends beyond
perpetual bigness,

01:08:24.763 --> 01:08:26.662
there's also...

01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:28.596
infinite
smallness?

01:08:30.736 --> 01:08:32.703
How?

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:34.671
Easy.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.707
Take
an asymptotic line

01:08:36.774 --> 01:08:38.709
and extend it
outward.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.179
Right,
right, right.

01:08:42.247 --> 01:08:44.215
So perpetual bigness

01:08:44.283 --> 01:08:46.183
exists simultaneously

01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.116
with perpetual
smallness.

01:08:49.755 --> 01:08:51.620
What was I thinking?

01:08:57.296 --> 01:09:00.197
What if C-A-T

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:03.131
really spelled dog?

01:09:09.308 --> 01:09:10.741
- God.
- Wow.

01:09:10.809 --> 01:09:12.709
That's heavy,
Ogre.

01:09:12.778 --> 01:09:14.473
Dog.

01:09:48.747 --> 01:09:50.942
<i>Kind of a bummer, huh?</i>

01:09:56.588 --> 01:09:58.055
<i>Gilbert?</i>

01:09:58.123 --> 01:09:59.784
<i>Hello, Lewis.</i>

01:10:01.793 --> 01:10:03.727
<i>How did you</i>
<i>get here?</i>

01:10:03.795 --> 01:10:06.195
<i>Don't ask me.</i>
<i>It's your dream.</i>

01:10:06.265 --> 01:10:08.233
<i>I woke up.</i>

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.962
<i>No, you dreamed</i>
<i>You woke up.</i>

01:10:12.804 --> 01:10:13.964
<i>Ow!</i>

01:10:14.039 --> 01:10:15.199
<i>Ow!</i>

01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:17.208
<i>Thanks a lot, Gilbert.</i>

01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:20.074
<i>I was dreaming about</i>
<i>three naked girls.</i>

01:10:20.145 --> 01:10:23.637
<i>I know, and I'm</i>
<i>a little shocked.</i>

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:27.142
<i>Come on, Lewis.</i>

01:10:27.219 --> 01:10:28.686
<i>Come on.</i>

01:10:28.754 --> 01:10:30.688
<i>Don't even</i>
<i>think about it.</i>

01:10:30.756 --> 01:10:33.350
<i>You're still dreaming.</i>
<i>You're not awake.</i>

01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:34.585
<i>Look.</i>

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:39.857
<i>Wow.</i>

01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:41.831
<i>What do you know,</i>
<i>Gilbert?</i>

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.869
<i>I know you're acting</i>
<i>like a weenie.</i>

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:47.370
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to the old Lewis?</i>

01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:50.340
<i>He got dropped on</i>
<i>a deserted island</i>

01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:52.343
<i>With Ogre,</i>
<i>of all people.</i>

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:54.379
<i>Those people</i>
<i>think we're nerds,</i>

01:10:54.446 --> 01:10:56.380
<i>and I think</i>
<i>they're right.</i>

01:10:56.448 --> 01:10:58.882
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what they think.</i>

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:00.679
<i>Did you forget</i>
<i>everything</i>

01:11:00.752 --> 01:11:02.686
<i>we learned at Adams?</i>

01:11:02.754 --> 01:11:04.221
<i>Come here.</i>

01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:06.189
<i>What do we have here?</i>

01:11:06.258 --> 01:11:08.226
<i>A great group of guys,</i>

01:11:08.293 --> 01:11:10.227
<i>but they need someone</i>

01:11:10.295 --> 01:11:13.230
<i>to make them feel proud</i>
<i>about themselves.</i>

01:11:13.298 --> 01:11:15.732
<i>She's not</i>
<i>one of the guys!</i>

01:11:15.801 --> 01:11:17.735
She <i>betrayed me.</i>

01:11:17.803 --> 01:11:19.737
<i>Lewis,</i>
<i>use your brain.</i>

01:11:19.805 --> 01:11:21.705
<i>She wouldn't</i>
<i>be here</i>

01:11:21.773 --> 01:11:23.741
<i>if she</i>
<i>didn't care.</i>

01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:28.012
<i>Will you</i>
<i>keep it down?</i>

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.412
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>wake up.</i>

01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.507
<i>Gilbert's</i>
<i>my best friend,</i>

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:35.178
<i>and this is</i>
<i>an important dream.</i>

01:11:35.253 --> 01:11:37.187
<i>You guys know that.</i>

01:11:37.255 --> 01:11:40.691
<i>She's a great girl,</i>
<i>you're a great guy.</i>

01:11:40.759 --> 01:11:44.695
<i>If she doesn't like you</i>
<i>for who you are,</i>

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:47.163
<i>she's not</i>
<i>good enough for you.</i>

01:11:47.232 --> 01:11:48.995
<i>I know that.</i>

01:11:49.067 --> 01:11:51.001
<i>How do you</i>
<i>know that?</i>

01:11:51.069 --> 01:11:52.502
<i>I don't.</i>

01:11:52.571 --> 01:11:54.937
<i>I'm just</i>
<i>your image of Gilbert.</i>

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:57.031
<i>Gilbert, stick</i>
<i>to the subject.</i>

01:11:57.109 --> 01:12:00.169
<i>I don't know how long</i>
<i>you'll be here.</i>

01:12:00.245 --> 01:12:01.542
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:05.105
<i>The subject is,</i>
<i>you're acting like a weenie.</i>

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:08.343
<i>I am.</i>

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.978
<i>It's not too late.</i>

01:12:10.055 --> 01:12:12.717
<i>We've gotta</i>
<i>get off this island.</i>

01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:15.817
<i>They're gonna vote us</i>
<i>out of existence.</i>

01:12:15.894 --> 01:12:18.556
You've <i>gotta</i>
<i>get out of here.</i>

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:19.892
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:22.900
<i>Time's running short.</i>
<i>Your course is clear.</i>

01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:24.765
<i>You look great.</i>

01:12:24.836 --> 01:12:26.895
<i>I believe in you.</i>

01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:31.175
<i>What happens now,</i>
<i>Gilbert?</i>

01:12:31.243 --> 01:12:33.643
<i>Well, now</i>
<i>you're gonna wake up,</i>

01:12:33.712 --> 01:12:35.577
<i>so I gotta go.</i>

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:43.688
<i>Ha. It doesn't</i>
<i>always work.</i>

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:48.019
<i>See you.</i>

01:12:49.728 --> 01:12:51.161
<i>So long.</i>

01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:53.197
<i>Night, guys.</i>

01:13:06.244 --> 01:13:08.447
Gentlemen, awaken!

01:13:08.613 --> 01:13:10.171
Let's go!

01:13:10.248 --> 01:13:11.681
Come on!

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.684
Up, everybody, up!

01:13:13.752 --> 01:13:15.379
Move your butts!

01:13:15.454 --> 01:13:17.217
Sunny, I'm sorry.

01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:18.483
What?

01:13:18.557 --> 01:13:20.548
Come on, please, Sunny.

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.718
I've been
ignorant and proud.

01:13:22.794 --> 01:13:24.227
Yeah.

01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:26.161
Can't you forgive me?

01:13:26.231 --> 01:13:28.165
Real ignorant
and proud.

01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:31.964
We can't let them
vote us out of existence.

01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:33.766
We're stranded here.

01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:35.500
What do you want?

01:13:35.574 --> 01:13:39.635
We have an aggregate IQ
of over 1,000.

01:13:39.711 --> 01:13:41.679
Anything's possible.

01:13:41.746 --> 01:13:42.644
Amen!

01:13:42.714 --> 01:13:44.147
Who's with me?

01:13:47.252 --> 01:13:48.913
I am.

01:13:48.987 --> 01:13:50.352
All right!

01:13:50.422 --> 01:13:52.219
Enough
of the hugging!

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:53.848
Let's go kill them.

01:13:53.925 --> 01:13:56.860
First, we have to
determine our location.

01:13:56.928 --> 01:13:58.828
Given
our travel time

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:01.331
of 122 minutes
and 47 seconds

01:14:01.399 --> 01:14:04.197
and a headwind
of 14.7 knots,

01:14:04.269 --> 01:14:06.669
and if we take
cross variables

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:08.672
and factor out
the constants,

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:11.174
that's 2 degrees
by 2 kilometers.

01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:13.211
Two plus two
would be...

01:14:13.278 --> 01:14:14.677
Four!

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:16.213
Right.

01:14:16.281 --> 01:14:19.614
That means
that we are no more than...

01:14:21.786 --> 01:14:25.552
44.74 miles from
the southernmost tip of Florida.

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:29.821
Just a little to the left.

01:14:29.895 --> 01:14:31.658
A little to the right.

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:32.662
Okay.

01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:36.132
The angle of the sun
will pinpoint

01:14:36.201 --> 01:14:38.863
our exact latitude
and longitude.

01:14:38.937 --> 01:14:41.030
Okay. To the left.

01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:41.970
Wormser!

01:14:43.575 --> 01:14:44.906
22.3.

01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:48.906
Rodriguez Island.

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.107
Frederico Rodriguez?

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:53.707
Was he
an old boyfriend?

01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:57.277
General Rodriguez stole
some military supplies

01:14:57.355 --> 01:14:59.880
from Castro
during Bay of Pigs.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:02.358
He hid them
on his island.

01:15:02.427 --> 01:15:03.860
- This island?
- This island?

01:15:03.929 --> 01:15:05.226
Yes.

01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:07.595
There must be
tons of shit.

01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:09.691
If your calculations
are correct.

01:15:09.768 --> 01:15:11.736
Wow!
Military supplies.

01:15:11.803 --> 01:15:14.533
All we gotta do
is find them.

01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.005
Right, Poindexter?

01:15:16.074 --> 01:15:18.406
Tell me again
what you did.

01:15:18.476 --> 01:15:20.410
I ionized
the coconut milk

01:15:20.478 --> 01:15:22.378
and deionized
the seawater

01:15:22.447 --> 01:15:24.381
using your glasses
to distill

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:26.349
the silicate
from the sand.

01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:28.318
Then I reversed
the polarity

01:15:28.386 --> 01:15:30.354
of the magnetization.

01:15:30.422 --> 01:15:32.652
It's crude,
but it might work.

01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:34.191
I hope so.

01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:36.352
You guys
built this thing.

01:15:36.428 --> 01:15:38.828
Too bad
you can't carry it.

01:15:38.897 --> 01:15:40.364
Ogre, shh!

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:43.265
Come on, you geek.
Carry this thing.

01:16:00.952 --> 01:16:02.112
Loud?

01:16:03.955 --> 01:16:05.889
Spread out!
Spread out!

01:16:05.957 --> 01:16:07.891
Let's look
for it, guys.

01:16:07.959 --> 01:16:09.790
What is it?

01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:11.522
Hey, you guys!

01:16:11.596 --> 01:16:13.530
I found a cable!

01:16:13.598 --> 01:16:15.566
So did we!

01:16:19.137 --> 01:16:20.104
Geeks!

01:16:27.946 --> 01:16:29.538
Hey, guys...

01:16:29.614 --> 01:16:31.081
bingo.

01:16:35.453 --> 01:16:38.013
Hey, Booger!

01:16:38.089 --> 01:16:39.920
Booger,
come here, man.

01:16:39.991 --> 01:16:41.822
Check this out.

01:16:44.496 --> 01:16:46.430
What the hell
is it?

01:16:46.498 --> 01:16:49.433
I don't know,
but there's a lot.

01:16:49.501 --> 01:16:51.628
Could be
our ticket out.

01:16:51.803 --> 01:16:53.771
And now...

01:16:53.838 --> 01:16:56.170
the last order
of business

01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:58.334
before we close
this convention.

01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:02.673
As many of you
already know,

01:17:02.747 --> 01:17:06.410
the Adams College chapter
of Lambda Lambda Lambda

01:17:06.484 --> 01:17:08.452
disgraced itself yesterday

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.684
by being arrested on a charge
of grand theft auto.

01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:24.791
Pursuant to

01:17:24.869 --> 01:17:27.235
the recently adopted
constitutional amendment,

01:17:27.305 --> 01:17:31.742
we must now vote on
whether to expel those Lambdas

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:33.744
from the conference

01:17:33.812 --> 01:17:36.144
and to terminate
its national charter.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.717
Before we vote,

01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:46.757
do the Lambdas
have anything to say

01:17:46.825 --> 01:17:48.725
in their defense?

01:17:48.793 --> 01:17:50.658
Anything at all?

01:17:53.498 --> 01:17:57.434
If I could just interject
for a second here.

01:17:57.502 --> 01:17:59.936
I find this
really insulting.

01:18:00.004 --> 01:18:02.438
I guess
the Lambdas don't feel

01:18:02.507 --> 01:18:04.907
they have to
explain their actions

01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:06.841
to their brothers.

01:18:17.822 --> 01:18:19.847
Aah!

01:18:24.362 --> 01:18:27.889
If we can just have
a little order...

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:32.994
then we can get
this whole sad event behind us.

01:18:33.071 --> 01:18:36.370
All those in favor
of expelling the Lambdas,

01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:37.874
please signify...

01:18:41.312 --> 01:18:42.802
What is that?

01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:59.362
Gentlemen!

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.593
It's the nerds.
They're back and they're bad.

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:04.498
We wanted
to be heard.

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:05.831
That's my leg!

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.774
Wait! Stop!

01:19:10.842 --> 01:19:13.936
Sit down!
A motion's on the floor!

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:16.708
Poindexter, stop!
We're here!

01:19:16.781 --> 01:19:18.715
Hooray!

01:19:18.783 --> 01:19:19.943
Aah!

01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:21.610
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

01:19:24.956 --> 01:19:27.288
Let me out,
you crazy maniac!

01:19:29.427 --> 01:19:30.792
Stop it!

01:19:52.984 --> 01:19:54.918
Nice job,
Poindexter.

01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:55.816
Yo.

01:20:00.225 --> 01:20:02.420
Can I borrow
your mike?

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:03.926
Sure.

01:20:03.995 --> 01:20:05.485
Thanks.

01:20:05.563 --> 01:20:08.430
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:10.262
Sorry, pal.

01:20:10.335 --> 01:20:13.998
I would like to speak
in our defense.

01:20:14.072 --> 01:20:17.098
No, there's a motion
to expel you.

01:20:17.175 --> 01:20:19.109
My statement will be brief.

01:20:19.177 --> 01:20:20.974
Fellas, get him.

01:20:21.045 --> 01:20:22.603
Cool down.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.614
Hey.
We wanna hear

01:20:24.682 --> 01:20:26.946
what the brother
has to say.

01:20:29.954 --> 01:20:31.353
Sure thing.

01:20:31.422 --> 01:20:33.058
Right...

01:20:33.191 --> 01:20:33.953
Tiny?

01:20:34.025 --> 01:20:35.890
Yeah.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.188
Yeah.

01:20:37.262 --> 01:20:39.127
Yeah, that's
great, fellas.

01:20:39.197 --> 01:20:40.858
You're dead, nerd.

01:20:40.932 --> 01:20:42.900
You're
dead meat.

01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:44.457
Thanks, guys.

01:20:44.536 --> 01:20:46.527
Ogre.
Where's Ogre?

01:20:46.604 --> 01:20:49.368
What did you do
to Ogre?

01:20:49.441 --> 01:20:50.408
Hey!

01:20:52.444 --> 01:20:54.139
Hi, Rog!

01:20:54.212 --> 01:20:56.806
Ogre, baby,
are you okay?

01:20:56.881 --> 01:20:58.405
I'm fine.

01:20:58.483 --> 01:21:00.883
I got a job
for you.

01:21:00.952 --> 01:21:02.419
Great.

01:21:02.487 --> 01:21:05.354
Take a look
at these guys.

01:21:05.423 --> 01:21:09.291
Tell me what these guys
have in common, Ogre.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.419
I don't know, Rog.

01:21:11.496 --> 01:21:13.430
They're all
wearing green.

01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:15.830
Come on,
take a closer look.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.424
They're ugly.

01:21:17.502 --> 01:21:19.402
They're wearing
funny clothes.

01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:20.938
They're different.

01:21:21.005 --> 01:21:24.270
Look at this pathetic
bunch of losers.

01:21:24.342 --> 01:21:26.742
You got an effeminate
little pansy.

01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:27.869
Hey!

01:21:27.946 --> 01:21:30.141
You got
a four-eyed geek,

01:21:30.215 --> 01:21:31.944
a nose-picking pervert.

01:21:32.016 --> 01:21:33.677
Where's the monitor

01:21:33.751 --> 01:21:35.719
of this
special ed class?

01:21:35.787 --> 01:21:36.879
Enough!

01:21:36.955 --> 01:21:39.788
Nobody talks about
my brothers that way.

01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:42.190
They're all
about to get expelled

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.228
for stealing my car.

01:21:44.295 --> 01:21:47.287
They didn't steal it!
They were framed!

01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:49.697
He set them up!

01:21:49.767 --> 01:21:51.701
Okay, maybe I did.

01:21:51.769 --> 01:21:55.466
What are you gonna do?
Make a speech?

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:58.373
It's not
gonna do any good

01:21:58.443 --> 01:22:01.071
because I'm strong
and you're weak.

01:22:01.146 --> 01:22:04.582
I'm the guy
everyone wants to be like,

01:22:04.649 --> 01:22:06.583
and you are pathetic.

01:22:06.651 --> 01:22:09.449
That's the way
it's always gonna be,

01:22:09.521 --> 01:22:12.922
and there's nothing you
or your geek friends

01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:15.391
can do or say about it.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.052
<i>Comprende,</i> dick-head?

01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:22.329
You're right,
Roger.

01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:27.763
There's nothing
I can say about it.

01:22:41.452 --> 01:22:45.013
But there's something
I've gotta do about it.

01:23:04.943 --> 01:23:07.912
Lewis,
you stud, you!

01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:09.139
Nerds!

01:23:09.214 --> 01:23:10.579
Nerds!

01:23:10.648 --> 01:23:12.775
Ogre!

01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:14.044
Ogre!

01:23:14.118 --> 01:23:15.176
Nerds!

01:23:15.253 --> 01:23:16.686
Ogre!

01:23:16.754 --> 01:23:18.153
Uh...

01:23:18.223 --> 01:23:19.315
Nerds!

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.482
Nerds!

01:23:20.558 --> 01:23:22.693
Nerds!

01:23:22.826 --> 01:23:23.724
Nerds!

01:23:26.163 --> 01:23:28.131
Dear brethren,

01:23:28.198 --> 01:23:30.132
we are called together
today

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.134
to initiate
the newest member

01:23:32.202 --> 01:23:34.636
of the Lambda Lambda Lambda
fraternity.

01:23:34.705 --> 01:23:36.639
Do you,

01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:38.641
Fredrick Aloysius
Polowatsky,

01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.609
solemnly swear
to stand together

01:23:40.677 --> 01:23:42.645
with
your fellow brethren

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:44.613
with dignity
and compassion?

01:23:44.681 --> 01:23:46.774
To respect all those

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:48.818
who pass
through these doors?

01:23:48.885 --> 01:23:50.318
And to uphold
the values

01:23:50.387 --> 01:23:53.823
we hold dear to
the Tri-Lambs?

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:55.380
I do!

01:24:05.736 --> 01:24:08.569
Are we ready with
the ceremonial punch?

01:24:25.689 --> 01:24:26.883
Fredrick.

01:24:26.957 --> 01:24:28.117
Ogre.

01:24:28.191 --> 01:24:29.522
Fredrick.

01:24:35.699 --> 01:24:36.688
Hup!

01:24:42.172 --> 01:24:45.141
Oh, Lambda truest,

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:48.644
I am
the newest member

01:24:48.712 --> 01:24:51.112
of your clan,

01:24:51.181 --> 01:24:53.046
and in your...

01:24:54.718 --> 01:24:56.151
- Hallways.
- Hallways.

01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:57.311
Hallways,

01:24:57.387 --> 01:24:59.821
I swear I'll always
be proud

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.858
of what I am.

01:25:01.925 --> 01:25:03.654
And now,

01:25:03.727 --> 01:25:06.059
our newest Tri-Lamb
may drink.

01:25:24.748 --> 01:25:27.012
Ya ya ya!

01:25:45.036 --> 01:25:46.594
# Grab your coat, honey #

01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:47.762
# Grab your hat #

01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:49.305

01:25:51.075 --> 01:25:52.440
# Don't need a ticket #

01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:53.977
# Can't you understand? #

01:25:54.045 --> 01:25:55.478
#You're on your way #

01:25:55.546 --> 01:25:57.104
#To the promised land? #

01:25:57.181 --> 01:25:58.671
# It's overdue #

01:25:58.749 --> 01:26:01.809
# But now
the time is right #

01:26:01.886 --> 01:26:03.285
#Yeah #

# It's up to you #

01:26:04.955 --> 01:26:06.252
#To make it real #

01:26:06.323 --> 01:26:07.915
# So take me #

# "Or you're gonna be late" #

01:26:27.611 --> 01:26:29.044
#Take your mind
off your worries #

01:26:29.113 --> 01:26:30.546
# For a moment or two #

01:26:30.614 --> 01:26:32.081

to the rhythm #
