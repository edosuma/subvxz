<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.200 --> 00:17.873
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.080 --> 00:20.993
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.200 --> 00:23.635
<i>is that she would</i>
<i>set it all to music.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.676
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>

<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.120 --> 00:41.909
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't</i>
<i>seem to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.120 --> 00:46.797
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:51.276

[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

02:14.800 --> 02:17.269
I thought I'd make us
some blueberry pancakes
this morning.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.040
Great.
Oh, I love blueberry pancakes.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.232
Reminds me of my
childhood in Pittsburgh.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.272
Not that we actually grew
blueberries in Pittsburgh.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.920
Nothing actually grows
in Pittsburgh,

02:25.960 --> 02:29.749

blueberry pancakes.
I can't... Hello?

Hey, little brother.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.159
Cooking breakfast, Burt?
Yep.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.717
Well, I hope your cooking
here is more successful
than it is upstairs.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.001
What are you talking about?

02:48.160 --> 02:50.629
Just a little something
I found in your bathroom
this morning.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.991
<i>The Cookbook of Sex.</i>

02:54.280 --> 02:56.715
For a second there, Burt,
I thought that the Happy Hooker

02:56.920 --> 02:59.000
and the Galloping Gourmet
had decided to collaborate.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.554
Just give me the book.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.634
I couldn't help but browse.
You know how I love to cook.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.436

of wonderful things I could do
with a duck.

People are eating.

There's nothing to talk about.
I start the shots next week.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.799

Oh, what a sense of humour.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.952
I mean, this guy
would actually go out

04:07.160 --> 04:10.756
and get those shots
if he thought it would
make us laugh.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.917

Burt, remember, 2:00 today.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.112
Oh, I can't.
I can't today, Mary. I can't.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.720
The bricklayers
are coming tomorrow,

04:27.920 --> 04:30.276
and the guys haven't finished
pouring the foundation yet.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.314
I mean, the foundation doesn't
get poured, bricks don't get laid.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.279
Bricks?

04:35.960 --> 04:38.350
The man's worried about bricks?

04:38.920 --> 04:41.674
Burt, Dr. Medlow
is a very busy man.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.237
This is the only appointment
he could give us. We can't cancel.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.517
All right, all right, all right.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.355

Knock it off. You don't know him.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.795
Oh, not personally.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.720
I've never had the need
to consult a sex psychiatrist.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.600
He happens to be
a dermatologist.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.514
Oh, come on, Burt.
I know what Dr. Medlow does.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.758
And what you don't.
Oh, I'm gonna...

05:06.920 --> 05:09.719
And I'm the one who
should see a psychiatrist?

05:09.960 --> 05:11.838
Mary, those two boys
are on a banana boat.

that's hysterical.

to take to a psychiatrist.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.240
Come on, darling.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.638
I'm sure Dr. Medlow will
get to the bottom of the
problem in no time.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.356
And it'll turn out to be
a simple thing. You'll see.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.360
Hmph. Simple thing.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.835
A simple thing.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.920
I mean, I should go to
a psychiatrist to find out
why I'm impotent?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.520
I know why I'm impotent.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.076
I'm impotent because every
time I go to make love to you,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.875
I see before me
the face of your dead husband.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.434
The man I murdered.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.111
I mean, just see something like that
and then try to get in the mood.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.039
Now I'm gonna pay a psychiatrist

05:52.240 --> 05:54.596

which I'm hiding.

Or better yet, let's put it in the
yellow pages under "Burt."

Oh, absolutely.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.120
And many things can bring it on.

Fear, worry, medication,

Well, in my case,
it was a Playboy bunny.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.437
Just a weekend. Ahem.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.313
Now, there are a variety of ways

15:11.920 --> 15:13.513

a little deeper,

22:14.040 --> 22:15.918
Oh, my God.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.676
Mrs. Tate?

22:21.520 --> 22:24.672
Hello, Mrs. Fine. I...

22:24.880 --> 22:27.998
Well, I didn't know
you were here.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.590
Where were you?
In the bathroom.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.320
Oh?
Cleaning.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.520
Cleaning?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.160
Yes, I was cleaning.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.238
I know this may
sound silly, Mrs. Tate,

22:37.440 --> 22:40.080
but I love to clean.
I just love it.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.749
And ever since my husband
got me a maid,

22:42.960 --> 22:45.316
I have nothing
to clean anymore. Nothing.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.438
I see.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.750
What are you doing here?

22:49.120 --> 22:50.395
Me?
Mm-hm.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.717
Uh, decorating.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.677
Decorating?
Yes. Oh, I just love to decorate.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.031
And, of course,
my house is already decorated,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.152
and this poor boy's
apartment is just awful.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.915
Decorating. Hm. Ahem.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.759
Cleaning?

23:08.880 --> 23:10.234
Goodbye, Mrs. Tate.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.313
Goodbye, Mrs. Fine.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.916
