18:08.713 --> 18:10.203
Alex, wait.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.463
You can't date this guy.
What are you doing?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.294
Stopping you from making
a mistake.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.460
What? You get to date
half of Chicago.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.254
Tracy Labarski, by the way. Ew.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.924
And I finally go on one date
and you show up and ruin it?

18:22.226 --> 18:24.558
Al, Skeet Ulrich lives
in Max and Dave's ceiling.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.312
Wait. You're Max and Dave.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.813
Yeah.
That's right.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.769
You do not
take someone's Apple Smacks

18:31.068 --> 18:32.729
without getting a serious
beat-down.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.396
You can't act hard when you're
talking about cereal.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.156
Yeah? If I do a couple
of warning lunges at him, huh?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.658
Some maniac blinks, huh?
| am so lost.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.365
A friend told me about this.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.371
| was only there
until I sold a painting.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.876
But I've never actually seen
Dave and Max, just heard them.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.627
<i>Wait, you're Alice.
Who's Alice?</i>

18:51.922 --> 18:55.756
Oh, Dave mourned the end
of the relationship for days.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.794
Uh, I thought he was saying
Alice, but it was hard to hear

18:59.096 --> 19:00.507
through the sobbing.
Sobbing?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.342
You didn't.
You heard me not sobbing

19:02.642 --> 19:04.633
and being over it.
What does that sound like?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.050
I'll tell you later.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.890
| called the series
Dave's Despair.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.304
| thought the emotional pain

19:09.607 --> 19:11.189
in those paintings
looked familiar.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.145
You're a super-talented artist.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.855
But you do not steal
from people.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.612
You're right, I'm sorry.
Is that my shirt?

19:17.907 --> 19:21.650
What? That is just-- I'm gonna
exit through the gift shop.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.535
Wait, you squat
in their crawlspace?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.195
Yeah, I'm a rebel,
can you dig it?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.705
| know.
But, uh, I don't think

19:28.000 --> 19:29.741
we should see
each other anymore.

19:30.044 --> 19:33.787
There's a bro code
and I can't do that to him.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.961
Sorry, kid.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.546
[GIGGLES]

19:41.472 --> 19:43.338
What?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.554
So, clearly,
someone is trying to tell me

19:51.857 --> 19:53.268
that I am not ready
to date yet.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.899
Oh, by the way, and I know
| don't have a say in it,

19:56.195 --> 19:58.812
but when you're ready,
| promise I'll be cool with it.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.480
Thank you.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.024
In fact, there's a guy
living under my steak truck.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.408
| could introduce you.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.445
He's got a nice, full beard.
Stop it.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.284
What is going on with you
and this diet peach iced tea?

20:09.583 --> 20:13.201
Oh, this isn't for us.
Malcolm, incoming.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.710
MALCOLM:
Hey, thanks, man.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.212
Enjoy the shirt!

20:17.508 --> 20:19.249
Cool. Oh, hey, do you
have a belt I could--

20:19.552 --> 20:21.668
A brown one would be--
Coming at you.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.052
This guy's awesome.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.966
Ladies, gentlemen, Alex,

20:28.269 --> 20:30.931
| like to call this

20:32.857 --> 20:34.894

DAVE: Skill I didn't know I had.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.398
PENNY:

20:36.694 --> 20:38.150
BRAD:
Are you checking your pulse?

20:38.446 --> 20:40.153
ALEX:
You never jog in real life.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.906
<i>MAX:. Oh, pretty good form.
PENNY: That's really good.</i>

20:43.200 --> 20:45.362
JANE:
Cookies with the push-up? Bold.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.026
This is--
BRAD: A tour de force.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.616
Is it gonna get sexy?
Yeah, it gets sexy right here.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.577
