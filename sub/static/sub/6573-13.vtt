<i>NARRATOR: George Michael
Bluth had never been</i>

00:12.696 --> 00:14.156
<i>- more popular.
- GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing): No.</i>

00:14.198 --> 00:15.699
<i>He was surrounded by people</i>

00:15.740 --> 00:18.285
<i>who were thrilled to be in his company.</i>

00:18.327 --> 00:19.744
Carlos was just... tickling me.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.454
They're almost out of root beer.

00:21.496 --> 00:23.498
So I got you one with
the last bit of root beer

00:23.540 --> 00:25.209
because I remember that
somebody was saying that, um,

00:25.250 --> 00:26.626
George Michael likes root beer.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.503
<i>And as his business was taking off... </i>

00:28.545 --> 00:30.005
I do. Thanks a lot.

00:30.047 --> 00:31.715
You guys don't have to
do all this, you know?

00:31.756 --> 00:32.883
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

00:32.924 --> 00:34.759
to show her I'm doing well, you know?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.094
<i>- ... so was his romantic life.
- Show her I'm an adult.</i>

00:36.136 --> 00:37.304
Hey, stop it!

00:37.346 --> 00:38.680
You're dead, man, you are so dead.

00:38.722 --> 00:40.724
That was the last root beer snow cone.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.142
I got that for him, Carlos.

00:42.184 --> 00:43.643
Teach you for being such a kiss ass, Terry.

00:43.685 --> 00:44.895
<i>And it was an ex-Bluth Company employee... </i>

00:44.936 --> 00:46.730
TOM: Come on, you guys, not cool.

00:46.771 --> 00:48.773
<i>Who was the most grateful
to be in his company.</i>

00:48.815 --> 00:50.901
- Want any of these?
- No, I'm fine.

00:50.942 --> 00:53.028
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

00:53.070 --> 00:55.155
I just wish I understood...

00:55.197 --> 00:56.823
why.

00:56.865 --> 00:59.159
That's why... because you could ask us

00:59.201 --> 01:01.078
why we do this, and mean it.

01:01.119 --> 01:04.122
The fact that you could
be so down to earth...

01:04.164 --> 01:05.623
CARLOS: And look so young.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.584
While you're starting this giant company.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.669
You created an opportunity many of us

01:09.711 --> 01:11.462
thought we'd never have again.

01:13.298 --> 01:15.508
See that's the part I
don't understand, Carlos.

01:15.550 --> 01:17.177
You know my name! What's his name?

01:17.219 --> 01:18.720
- You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.
- What's his name?

01:18.762 --> 01:20.138
Okay, guys, I'm gonna learn all your names.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.681
- I promise.
- REBEL: George.

01:21.723 --> 01:23.350
<i>- And that's when he heard what
- Rebel.</i>

01:23.392 --> 01:25.560
<i>- Had become his name.
- What is all this?</i>

01:25.602 --> 01:26.895
Oh, it's just a little surprise.

01:26.937 --> 01:28.605
- You did this for me?
- Yes!

01:28.646 --> 01:30.399
Well... well, they did it for me, but...

01:30.439 --> 01:33.318
but only because they knew I
wanted to do something for you.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.113
Maybe we could talk without your friends.

01:36.154 --> 01:37.614
I mean, these guys aren't
really my friends, you know.

01:37.655 --> 01:38.823
I barely know their names. (laughs)

01:38.865 --> 01:40.825
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

01:40.867 --> 01:43.536
only because of that old song
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

01:43.578 --> 01:45.080
Wait, what song is that?

01:45.122 --> 01:47.540
Oh, god, I knew he made that up.

01:47.582 --> 01:49.418
But it did help me remember.

01:49.459 --> 01:50.961
Anyway, don't worry about these
guys... they're not listening

01:51.002 --> 01:52.379
to a word we're saying.

01:52.421 --> 01:53.422
How about that kiss?

01:53.463 --> 01:54.839
We need to talk.

01:54.881 --> 01:58.302
(partygoers oohing)

01:58.343 --> 02:00.011
<i>NARRATOR: Now the story of a family</i>

02:32.585 --> 02:34.545
- (music stops)
- And...

02:34.587 --> 02:36.589
that's where the song should've ended.

02:36.631 --> 02:38.633
So I guess we all got
a little carried away.

02:38.675 --> 02:40.760
Are you sure? We all
ended at the same time.

02:40.802 --> 02:42.762
Yeah, well, it's because
you all sped up together.

02:42.804 --> 02:44.014
(laughs) Now, you know if I was

02:44.055 --> 02:45.556
playing in your band, I would say,

02:45.598 --> 02:47.225
"Hey, you know, let's do
the whole fast and loose

02:47.267 --> 02:48.393
with tempo thing."

02:48.435 --> 02:49.436
But this is about my demo tape

02:49.478 --> 02:50.519
to Juilliard and they've got

02:50.561 --> 02:52.147
to dig what I do so much

02:52.189 --> 02:54.316
that they start an entire
department for wood block.

02:54.358 --> 02:55.692
So I'm sorry guys.

02:55.733 --> 02:57.152
And you're leaving, okay.

02:57.194 --> 02:58.153
They left early.

02:58.195 --> 02:59.696
Proves my point.

02:59.737 --> 03:01.906
She was cute.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.241
They were playing way
too loud anyway, right?

03:03.283 --> 03:04.284
Could you even hear the wood block?

03:04.326 --> 03:05.452
Right at the end.

03:05.494 --> 03:07.371
We could record you separately,

03:07.412 --> 03:08.705
and then mix it louder on the computer.

03:08.746 --> 03:10.207
Well, then I'm not playing in a band.

03:10.248 --> 03:11.875
I mean, the whole point of the band

03:11.916 --> 03:13.793
is to showcase my amazing internal clock.

03:13.835 --> 03:15.586
You know, that's something
you have to be born with.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.088
<i>Or bred with.</i>

03:17.130 --> 03:19.216
<i>Which was the case with George Michael.</i>

03:19.257 --> 03:22.219
<i>Who, as a small child,
appeared in a promotional video</i>

03:22.260 --> 03:24.429
<i>for a developmental tool called "BabyTock"</i>

03:24.471 --> 03:27.474
BabyTock! will give your
child a head start at math.

03:27.516 --> 03:30.435
And if I were a doctor,
I would guarantee you

03:30.477 --> 03:34.022
that it would also boost
their brain power 110%.

03:34.064 --> 03:36.900
That's a lot of brain power.

03:36.941 --> 03:39.277
You've been using BabyTock!, correct?

03:39.319 --> 03:41.571
- For how long?
- TRACEY: For two months.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.949
But George Michael really
enjoys listening to the sound.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.784
And would you say it's...

03:46.826 --> 03:49.037
changed the power of his brain?

03:49.079 --> 03:51.331
Uh, well, that's impossible...

03:51.373 --> 03:53.291
LUCILLE: To deny.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.877
I've always wanted a smart baby.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.962
This thing really works, George.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.257
<i>In fact it came from something that didn't.</i>

04:00.298 --> 04:04.428
So we're stuck with 5,000 of
these worthless corn-ballers?

04:04.469 --> 04:06.971
<i>When they were looking to
recoup some of their costs</i>

04:07.013 --> 04:09.640
<i>after an ill-fated foray</i>

04:09.682 --> 04:12.143
<i>into the fry-at-home snack-food market.</i>

04:12.185 --> 04:13.103
Whoa, whoa.

04:13.144 --> 04:14.854
They're not worthless.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.773
You know? The timer still works.

04:16.814 --> 04:19.358
There's no numbers on it,
but it's very loud, so...

04:19.401 --> 04:22.695
Perfect for those who
like the sound of a clock,

04:22.737 --> 04:24.072
but don't know their numbers.

04:24.114 --> 04:25.407
That's good.

04:25.449 --> 04:27.534
We'll sell this to baby... (yells)

04:27.576 --> 04:29.619
Mother of (bleep)!

04:29.660 --> 04:31.704
We should put these in cribs.

04:31.746 --> 04:33.623
That's not a half puny thought.

04:33.664 --> 04:34.916
<i>GEORGE MICHAEL: And that Julliard thing is</i>

04:34.958 --> 04:36.126
confidential from my Dad by the way.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.544
He's never gonna want me to pursue

04:37.586 --> 04:39.588
- a career in...
- Hitting a block of wood.

04:39.629 --> 04:41.381
Music, yes

04:41.423 --> 04:43.425
You know, he still thinks of
me as the same George Michael

04:43.467 --> 04:44.759
that I was before my life

04:44.801 --> 04:46.261
blew apart, you know?

04:46.303 --> 04:47.971
Before the world cracked me open

04:48.012 --> 04:50.223
and I became the guy that
you're looking at now.

04:50.265 --> 04:51.933
George Michael 2.0.

04:51.975 --> 04:54.102
God, I hate my name.

04:54.144 --> 04:55.686
<i>The last five years</i>

04:55.728 --> 04:57.439
<i>had been a whirlwind for George Michael.</i>

04:57.481 --> 05:00.358
<i>He celebrated going off to college</i>

05:00.400 --> 05:01.692
<i>- at a party with his family.
- Hey! Next week, huh?</i>

05:01.734 --> 05:04.571
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

05:04.613 --> 05:07.407
- We are so proud.
- We have a little something for you.

05:07.449 --> 05:08.992
Oh, no, you don't have to do anything.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.453
I mean, you threw me this... meeting.

05:11.495 --> 05:13.997
Little something-something...

05:14.038 --> 05:15.457
to buy a car.

05:15.499 --> 05:17.167
(laughs): Oh, God, really?

05:19.043 --> 05:20.337
- No!
- GEORGE: Yes.

05:20.378 --> 05:22.506
- Maeby!
- (Maeby laughs)

05:22.547 --> 05:24.299
<i>But the party wouldn't last long.</i>

05:24.341 --> 05:25.425
- (door opens)
- MICHAEL: You know what?

05:25.467 --> 05:26.968
I am done with this family.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.428
I hope you've saved some money,

05:28.470 --> 05:30.221
'cause you're going to need every dime now.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.848
What's this?

05:31.889 --> 05:33.766
Return it... or rip it up.

05:33.808 --> 05:35.143
- Michael.
- Come on.

05:35.185 --> 05:36.520
Give it a rip.

05:36.561 --> 05:38.855
Rip it up... right down the center.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.905
That's it. Rip it.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.407
Couple more.

05:50.659 --> 05:52.076
Did you get it?

05:52.118 --> 05:53.453
Proud of you.

05:53.495 --> 05:54.745
Happy birthday.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.498
- GOB: Happy birthday, George Michael.
- Happy birthday.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.125
ALL: * Happy birthday to you *

05:59.167 --> 06:01.545
<i>- * Happy birthday to you... *
- But don't worry.</i>

06:01.586 --> 06:04.589
<i>Michael did make sure his son got a car... </i>

06:04.631 --> 06:07.133
Get out of here.

06:07.175 --> 06:10.719
<i>As he sent him off to college.</i>

06:10.761 --> 06:12.222
<i>And although he arrived at college</i>

06:12.263 --> 06:13.806
<i>without his possessions,</i>

06:13.848 --> 06:16.976
<i>he was finally at a place where he felt</i>

06:17.018 --> 06:18.936
<i>- he'd fit in.
- (Metallic screeching)</i>

06:18.978 --> 06:20.063
MAN: Hey, hey, check it out.

06:20.104 --> 06:21.856

06:23.483 --> 06:24.733
(truck door closes)

06:26.570 --> 06:28.905
(George Michael laughing)

06:28.946 --> 06:31.074
N... no.

06:31.115 --> 06:32.741
No, no.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.495
(laughs): What?

06:38.248 --> 06:40.124
<i>In his Freshman year, George Michael</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:43.086
<i>- hit the ground running.
- Sorry.</i>

06:43.127 --> 06:44.795
<i>He was breaking some of the old taboos.</i>

06:44.837 --> 06:47.465
<i>- Let's make it a... Pepsi.
- Drinking Pepsi in the morning.</i>

06:47.507 --> 06:50.301
So, it's a breakfast combo with a Pepsi.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.469
<i>Sometimes having eggs at night.</i>

06:51.511 --> 06:53.555
How about some eggs?

06:53.597 --> 06:55.348
Oh, excuse me, I forgot it wasn't morning.

06:55.390 --> 06:57.475
<i>He was soon finding that others
enjoyed his sense of humor.</i>

06:57.517 --> 06:59.686
(laughing): I forgot it wasn't morning.

06:59.728 --> 07:01.479
<i>A present from his Uncle Gob elevated</i>

07:01.521 --> 07:03.106
<i>- his newfound confidence.
- Hi.</i>

07:03.147 --> 07:05.358
My uncle is a magician.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.068
<i>Before diminishing it.</i>

07:08.777 --> 07:10.614
<i>But before he knew it</i>

07:10.655 --> 07:12.657
<i>sophomore year was upon him,</i>

07:12.699 --> 07:15.326
<i>- and everything got turned up to 11.
- Boom!</i>

07:15.368 --> 07:18.705
And that's what we call
only being behind by three.

07:18.747 --> 07:20.457
So then that stuff's all going
on with this Sitwell company.

07:20.498 --> 07:23.501
And then... we end up playing
them in a softball game.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.045
<i>Highlights... loyal friends.</i>

07:26.087 --> 07:27.672
I'm like, "How can that... ?"

07:27.714 --> 07:29.549
<i>Romance.</i>

07:29.591 --> 07:30.675
(muffled): Becky.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.176
<i>Betrayal.</i>

07:32.218 --> 07:33.762
Becky?

07:33.803 --> 07:35.096
What's up, Ray?

07:35.138 --> 07:36.473
You guys broke up.

07:36.514 --> 07:39.392
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

07:41.311 --> 07:42.687
<i>The triumph of friendship.</i>

07:42.729 --> 07:43.854
- What's up, Ray?
- Hey.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.149
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

07:46.190 --> 07:47.776
You know who I was thinking
about before you sat down?

07:47.817 --> 07:49.068
- What?
- Becky.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.445
Do you remember?

07:50.487 --> 07:52.863
<i>And as surely as stability returned,</i>

07:52.905 --> 07:56.493
<i>junior year ushered in a
new era of experimentation... </i>

07:56.534 --> 07:57.994
It's all about the science of kissing

07:58.035 --> 07:59.537
between a man and a woman.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.122
That always has fascinated me.

08:01.164 --> 08:02.540
Oh, good. Sheila will take you.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.041
<i>As George Michael tried to compensate</i>

08:04.083 --> 08:06.544
<i>for the lack of income from his father</i>

08:06.586 --> 08:09.339
<i>by volunteering for experiments.</i>

08:09.380 --> 08:11.257
Hi.

08:11.299 --> 08:15.094
So I don't run off?

08:15.136 --> 08:17.472
- I hope you're not feeling too awkward.
- Oh, don't be crazy.

08:17.514 --> 08:20.057
- Okay.
- Now when the mouth
to mouth test begins,

08:20.099 --> 08:23.269
I'm gonna be yelling out letters
that indicate mouth movements.

08:23.311 --> 08:24.813
What I need you to do is just give me

08:24.854 --> 08:26.481
on a scale of one to
ten your pleasure level.

08:26.523 --> 08:28.775
- Fine.
- Ten being the most
pleasurable, one the least.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.610
Let's hope we get to ten.

08:30.652 --> 08:33.488
- Well, work our way up to it.
- Bringing in the mouth unit!

08:33.530 --> 08:35.823
<i>And that's when he realized
what the straps were for.</i>

08:35.865 --> 08:39.202
Is that... ? Okay, I guess it's
not, uh, not gonna be a person.

08:39.243 --> 08:41.162
- And C?
- I think one on C.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.331
- M? M?
- Oh, one on...

08:43.373 --> 08:45.875
- M?
- One for sure on... one.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.210
- And Z?
- One.

08:47.251 --> 08:48.336
- N?
- One.

08:48.378 --> 08:50.171
- F? F?
- One. One.

08:50.213 --> 08:52.632
<i>But it wasn't until his year abroad</i>

08:52.674 --> 08:55.051
<i>that George Michael got
an education in life.</i>

08:58.054 --> 09:01.224
<i>Because after a year of trying
not to be an imposing guest</i>

09:01.265 --> 09:02.684
<i>in his new country,</i>

09:02.726 --> 09:04.602
<i>he was ready</i>

09:04.644 --> 09:08.272
<i>for a summer that would end up
turning his life upside down... </i>

09:08.314 --> 09:10.400
(both yelling in Spanish)

09:13.236 --> 09:15.530
<i>when the woman whose
children he was nannying... </i>

09:16.698 --> 09:18.199
(screams)

09:18.241 --> 09:20.034
<i>opened him up sexually.</i>

09:20.076 --> 09:22.495
Hey, hey, did Ernesto get his 4:00?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.248
The drones are coming.

09:25.289 --> 09:26.999
Nothing matters now.

09:32.922 --> 09:35.007
- Why do you kiss like this?
- Like what?

09:35.049 --> 09:37.260
The teeth, they must not be used like this.

09:37.301 --> 09:39.136
<i>It was actually a jaw and lip</i>

09:39.178 --> 09:41.431
<i>retraction issue, but
she had neither a command</i>

09:41.472 --> 09:44.601
<i>of the language nor the data that we do.</i>

09:45.727 --> 09:47.061
You make love like a boy.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.563
Spanish, speak to me in Spanish.

09:48.605 --> 09:50.481
Because the only way that college credit is

09:50.523 --> 09:51.733
actually activated is if I have...

09:51.775 --> 09:54.360
<i>- Dominarme.
- Cook... cook at... </i>

09:54.402 --> 09:55.986
- Cooking at you?
- Overpower me.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.072
Oh, yes, make me cry.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.449
You're a terrible mother.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.284
(high-pitched crying)

10:01.325 --> 10:03.661
<i>And so it was a very
different George Michael</i>

10:03.703 --> 10:06.330
<i>that returned to school for senior year.</i>

10:07.707 --> 10:09.250
<i>Eager to unleash his new</i>

10:09.292 --> 10:12.545
<i>overt sexuality on an unsuspecting campus.</i>

10:12.587 --> 10:13.922
(laughs) Hey, man.

10:13.963 --> 10:15.715
It gets better.

10:15.757 --> 10:16.883
(people laughing)

10:16.925 --> 10:18.342
<i>And for George Michael,</i>

10:18.384 --> 10:20.720
<i>senior year did get better.</i>

10:20.762 --> 10:22.680
<i>- He was like a king
- I sort of feel like a king</i>

10:22.722 --> 10:24.933
<i>- returning to his castle...
- Returning to his castle.</i>

10:24.974 --> 10:26.810
<i>Only to discover that they thought</i>

10:26.851 --> 10:28.436
<i>he was two kings.</i>

10:28.478 --> 10:29.938
Welcome to your castle.

10:29.979 --> 10:32.899
<i>And they had doubled
the size of his castle.</i>

10:32.941 --> 10:34.233
Double castle.

10:34.275 --> 10:36.110
BOTH: Can't wait to meet Michael, George.

10:36.152 --> 10:38.195
<i>It would be the perfect backdrop</i>

10:38.237 --> 10:40.698
<i>to unveil George Michael 2.0.</i>

10:40.740 --> 10:42.325
<i>GEORGE MICHAEL: Todo mio.</i>

10:42.366 --> 10:45.286
<i>Todo mia?</i>

10:45.328 --> 10:47.413
<i>Mio.</i>

10:51.083 --> 10:53.169
<i>- (knocking)
- But George Michael's
development was about</i>

10:53.210 --> 10:54.712
<i>- to be forestalled.
- Hey.</i>

10:54.754 --> 10:57.256
- Dad.
- Pete died.

10:57.298 --> 10:59.592
Oh, God.

10:59.634 --> 11:02.052
- Uh, who's, uh, Pete?
- Don't worry about it.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.805
Don't you worry about it.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.097
I like this.

11:05.139 --> 11:06.641
- I like the mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

11:06.683 --> 11:08.643
- Oh... it's kind of fun.
- That's great.

11:08.685 --> 11:09.936
Probably gonna want to shave it off

11:09.978 --> 11:11.604
before the start of next quarter.

11:11.646 --> 11:13.147
Otherwise, they're gonna
think you're a musician, huh?

11:13.189 --> 11:15.274
But I love it... dude.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.068
GEORGE MICHAEL: I'm never going to be

11:18.110 --> 11:19.445
louder than an electric guitar.

11:19.487 --> 11:20.780
Maybe using a band to showcase

11:20.822 --> 11:22.532
my wood block skill is a dumb idea.

11:22.573 --> 11:24.158
P-HOUND: Too bad there's no such thing

11:24.200 --> 11:25.869
as an electric wood block.

11:25.910 --> 11:28.663
GEORGE MICHAEL: That sounds
like a mother of an invention.

11:28.705 --> 11:30.665
<i>NARRATOR: And so they set to work</i>

11:30.707 --> 11:32.542
<i>inventing a downloadable app</i>

11:32.583 --> 11:34.627
<i>that would allow one to
play an electronic version</i>

11:34.669 --> 11:36.462
<i>of a wood block on their smartphone.</i>

11:36.504 --> 11:38.339
You see, that's important.

11:38.381 --> 11:39.757
Well, that's what it is.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.384
So it's basically like you'll always

11:41.425 --> 11:42.760
have a wood block with you.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.722
I can't believe nobody's ever done this.

11:45.763 --> 11:48.140
<i>A quick something search
would have shown the guys</i>

11:48.182 --> 11:51.895
<i>that there were already three
wood block apps on the market.</i>

11:51.936 --> 11:53.813
So, there are three on the market.

11:53.855 --> 11:55.606
<i>Which they did.</i>

11:55.648 --> 11:57.316
(George Michael speaking Spanish)

11:57.358 --> 11:58.860
<i>But even after doing that search,</i>

11:58.902 --> 12:00.277
<i>they were undeterred.</i>

12:00.319 --> 12:02.572
Download them. Come on, let's do it.

12:02.613 --> 12:04.657
I hope we're not doing this on my account.

12:04.699 --> 12:06.325
No, we're doing it so that we can see

12:06.367 --> 12:07.618
what the competition is like.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.662
No, I mean on my iTunes account.

12:09.704 --> 12:11.039
It's 99 cents.

12:11.079 --> 12:12.498
Yeah, times three.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.291
<i>And soon, they realized</i>

12:14.333 --> 12:17.461
<i>what kind of competition
they were up against.</i>

12:21.340 --> 12:22.800
Well, these are a (bleep) joke.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.552
- (laughing): I know.
- Where are the mallet options?

12:24.594 --> 12:27.095
There's no choice of
wood weight or grain type.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.806
There's no diameter hole option.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.433
I mean, what is this, BabyTock?

12:30.474 --> 12:31.768
- BabyTock?
- You know, the sharp

12:31.809 --> 12:33.561
metal box that you put in the crib.

12:33.603 --> 12:35.271
Is that not a well-known... ?

12:35.312 --> 12:37.105
<i>- But this is fine.
- And they set to work.</i>

12:37.147 --> 12:38.482
No, I understand that. I get that.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.526
But it just seems like
you're leaving a hole

12:40.568 --> 12:41.819
just right in the middle of the block.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.821
It won't be a block on anything 3G.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.990
<i>Although some of the work had
to happen outside the room.</i>

12:46.032 --> 12:47.825
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.159
<i>Which was challenging.</i>

12:49.201 --> 12:52.663
<i>And soon, they were
close to finishing an app</i>

12:52.705 --> 12:54.082
<i>they had decided to call... </i>

12:54.122 --> 12:55.750
Woodblock.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.334
It's taken.

12:58.419 --> 13:00.170
Blockwood.

13:01.089 --> 13:02.465
It's taken.

13:02.506 --> 13:04.008
<i>And that's when he came up with... </i>

13:04.050 --> 13:05.217
Block of Wood?

13:05.259 --> 13:06.636
<i>- Which was also taken.
- Wow.</i>

13:06.677 --> 13:08.512
- Block-block?
- No.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.222
People are going to think we're
in the chicken-noise business.

13:10.264 --> 13:11.641
How is that a chicken noise?

13:11.682 --> 13:14.142
You know... well, it's kind of hard to do

13:14.184 --> 13:17.105
in these matador pants, but, you know...

13:17.145 --> 13:19.649
- Block-bl...
- (over phone): Fakeblock is available.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.900
Do you want Fakeblock?

13:20.942 --> 13:22.693
Oh, uh, okay. They have Fakeblock.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.320
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

13:24.361 --> 13:26.447
No problem. That's no problem.

13:26.489 --> 13:28.365
Could you hang on to that for me, please?

13:28.407 --> 13:30.868
And I'll call you back. Thank you.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.370
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

13:33.412 --> 13:36.332
and then there's this
whole XML Web site fee.

13:36.373 --> 13:37.583
I got the last one.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.376
That was 99 cents.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.711
Times three.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.421
<i>And George Michael realized</i>

13:42.463 --> 13:44.007
<i>he needed to bring in some cash.</i>

13:44.048 --> 13:45.508
We actually have a variety of subjects

13:45.549 --> 13:47.384
that high school students need tutoring in.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.970
If you want to just
take a look at that list

13:49.012 --> 13:50.680
and let me know if there's anything there

13:50.721 --> 13:52.598
<i>- that you've handled before.
- There was... </i>

13:52.640 --> 13:54.058
<i>although George Michael</i>

13:54.100 --> 13:55.977
<i>couldn't imagine it was the same Maeby.</i>

13:56.019 --> 13:58.980
Is this "F" in "Maeby F."
her last name or her grade?

13:59.022 --> 14:00.773
Oh, it's her last name.

14:00.815 --> 14:02.232
But her most recent grade is...

14:02.274 --> 14:06.029
well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

14:07.071 --> 14:08.823
So, that bad?

14:08.865 --> 14:10.324
I'll take her.

14:10.366 --> 14:11.993
Stay on top of her.

14:12.035 --> 14:14.286
You may need to ride her pretty hard.

14:14.328 --> 14:16.497
Hey, you must be...

14:16.539 --> 14:18.290
What?

14:18.332 --> 14:20.501
- This is the girl you broke up with?
- Huh?

14:20.543 --> 14:22.545
What is this? (whispers):
I can't wear this.

14:22.586 --> 14:24.296
Yeah, well, we dated for
a while, but, you know,

14:24.338 --> 14:25.673
I was a kid, and I didn't know

14:25.715 --> 14:27.675
how to kiss yet. I don't know,

14:27.717 --> 14:29.093
for whatever reason, I listened to my dad

14:29.135 --> 14:30.511
who said we shouldn't make it work.

14:30.553 --> 14:32.513
- Was she your first?
- Cousin? No.

14:32.555 --> 14:34.974
Why would you... why would
your mind go right to... ? No.

14:35.016 --> 14:36.934
No, it's just that he was right.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.978
We were kids. I wasn't yet O.S.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.312
<i>- Overtly sexual.
- Overtly sexual.</i>

14:40.354 --> 14:42.439
Right. As I live and breathe. Crazy.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.400
- That's just crazy.
- (Knock on door)

14:44.441 --> 14:45.985
Okay, so listen.

14:46.027 --> 14:48.487
After I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out.

14:48.529 --> 14:50.948
All right? I can't let him
get in the way of this one.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.075
Hey, you must be...

14:52.116 --> 14:53.283
<i>But first, he had to cover his tracks.</i>

14:53.325 --> 14:55.161
<i>- What?
- This had to look like fate.</i>

14:55.203 --> 14:56.704
- George Michael?
- Huh?

14:56.746 --> 14:58.831
What is this? Maeby, what are you...

14:58.873 --> 15:01.209
doing here?

15:01.250 --> 15:03.335
<i>- As I live and breathe.
- But for the phrase, "as I live</i>

15:03.377 --> 15:05.088
<i>- I thought you were the girl.
- And breathe," he nailed it.</i>

15:05.129 --> 15:06.756
I'm supposed to tutor a kid from...

15:06.797 --> 15:09.383
High school. Yeah. That's me.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.427
Crazy. That is just crazy.

15:11.468 --> 15:13.387
<i>And even though George
Michael wanted to seduce her,</i>

15:13.429 --> 15:15.305
<i>he couldn't helpbut challenge</i>

15:15.347 --> 15:16.891
<i>her strategy for staying in high school.</i>

15:16.933 --> 15:19.643
But still, I mean, you have
to make a living, right?

15:19.685 --> 15:21.062
Don't you need an education?

15:21.104 --> 15:23.522
Well, don't forget... I'm a Harris.

15:23.564 --> 15:25.566
- Harris?
- Yeah.

15:25.608 --> 15:27.735
Someone who "inharris" a lot of money.

15:27.777 --> 15:29.153
Yeah, well, you know,

15:29.195 --> 15:31.405
I wouldn't put all my Anns in that basket.

15:31.447 --> 15:33.490
You know, it's fine. You don't get it.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.159
You've never been a risk taker.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.535
I like to (bleep) with people.

15:36.577 --> 15:38.037
That's what I do.

15:38.079 --> 15:40.748
- I'm making a statement.
- P-HOUND: I love it.

15:40.790 --> 15:41.916
MAEBY: You know, I knew you were cool

15:41.958 --> 15:43.126
when I saw you wearing that shirt.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.002
Thanks.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.212
<i>More betrayal.</i>

15:46.254 --> 15:47.463
Oh, no, I get it, too.

15:47.504 --> 15:49.132
No, I love... I love it, too.

15:49.173 --> 15:53.302
You know, I... I love to... love now.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.512
<i>George Michael found himself</i>

15:55.554 --> 15:57.556
<i>less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.</i>

15:57.598 --> 15:59.850
I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.228
P-HOUND: I love making
love to Spanish women.

16:02.270 --> 16:03.980
Get out.

16:04.021 --> 16:06.482
<i>And George Michael slipped
back into seduction mode.</i>

16:06.523 --> 16:10.278
Oh, a man, a woman...

16:10.319 --> 16:11.779
a bedroom.

16:11.821 --> 16:15.741
Let's solve for "X."

16:15.783 --> 16:18.035
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.871
Well, you know, in algebra,
you have an unknown element,

16:20.913 --> 16:23.082
and, uh, we call it "X," and then you have

16:23.124 --> 16:26.335
to solve for it to find
out what number "X" is.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.587
"X" isn't a number.

16:28.629 --> 16:30.631
So you don't even really know the basic...

16:30.673 --> 16:32.591
<i>But in that moment, the urge to educate her</i>

16:32.633 --> 16:34.551
<i>was more powerful than
the urge to kiss her.</i>

16:34.593 --> 16:37.263
Let me show you. I'll just
show you some stuff real quick.

16:37.305 --> 16:40.474
All right, so if you take
something like this... 3X+1=10...

16:40.516 --> 16:42.226
<i>And with the algebra lesson complete,</i>

16:42.268 --> 16:43.811
<i>George Michael pivoted back</i>

16:43.853 --> 16:45.855
<i>to his overtly sexual seduction.</i>

16:45.896 --> 16:47.982
Therefore, when I say,

16:48.024 --> 16:52.402
"You and me in a bedroom,
let's solve for 'X, '" I'm...

16:52.444 --> 16:55.072
I'm stating it as a kind of formula.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.490
Yeah, let's get wasted.

16:56.532 --> 16:58.575
Let's drink that formula.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.494
(chuckling): It's not that kind of formula.

17:00.536 --> 17:02.454
No, I'll show you what
a formula is real quick,

17:02.496 --> 17:04.040
- 'cause that's very important.
- (Door opens)

17:04.080 --> 17:05.915
<i>- But when the door opened,
- Dad?</i>

17:05.958 --> 17:08.711
<i>George Michael's window
of opportunity closed.</i>

17:08.752 --> 17:11.130
Bad news... P-Hound is
yanking our chain again.

17:11.172 --> 17:12.798
- MAEBY: Uncle Michael.
- MICHAEL: Oh, my God.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.634
<i>And after a brief
reunion, George Michael had</i>

17:15.675 --> 17:18.054
<i>another opportunity to impress his cousin.</i>

17:18.095 --> 17:20.430
He's got this privacy software,

17:20.472 --> 17:22.683
keeps people from stealing
your stuff. Tell her, pal.

17:22.724 --> 17:25.769
So its privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

17:25.810 --> 17:28.647
<i>George Michael weighed his options.</i>

17:28.689 --> 17:31.859
<i>Maeby had chastised him
for not taking risks,</i>

17:31.901 --> 17:33.944
<i>and what would be a bigger risk</i>

17:33.986 --> 17:35.779
<i>than perpetuating a lie about software</i>

17:35.821 --> 17:38.615
<i>just to ignite the passions of a woman?</i>

17:38.657 --> 17:40.951
<i>Of course, it would be a lie,</i>

17:40.993 --> 17:43.246
<i>and since Maeby wouldn't know it was a lie,</i>

17:43.287 --> 17:45.748
<i>he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk.</i>

17:45.789 --> 17:48.042
<i>Perhaps the bigger risk
was to tell his father</i>

17:48.084 --> 17:49.418
<i>he was lying.</i>

17:49.459 --> 17:50.878
<i>That he came up with it</i>

17:50.920 --> 17:52.880
<i>because he wanted his father to leave</i>

17:52.922 --> 17:55.674
<i>so he could enjoy what
remained of his senior year.</i>

17:55.716 --> 17:58.094
<i>After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be</i>

17:58.135 --> 18:01.264
<i>the course of action taken
by an overtly sexual man... </i>

18:01.305 --> 18:04.016
<i>a man who owns a pair of matador pants?</i>

18:04.058 --> 18:07.937
<i>He had not responded now for 41 seconds,</i>

18:07.978 --> 18:10.273
<i>according to his unfailing internal clock,</i>

18:10.314 --> 18:13.109
<i>and it was time to come clean.</i>

18:13.150 --> 18:14.568
Well, thanks. Yeah.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.445
It's a... well, it's just a Boolean-driven

18:16.486 --> 18:20.490
aggregation, really, of what
programmers call "hacker traps."

18:20.532 --> 18:23.493
<i>And he found himself
suddenly and effortlessly</i>

18:23.535 --> 18:26.414
<i>tapping into a long-inbred
instinct for lying.</i>

18:26.496 --> 18:29.750
<i>A Bluth taking his first steps in deceit.</i>

18:29.792 --> 18:31.794
<i>But the more he talked,</i>

18:31.835 --> 18:33.670
<i>the more he actually
started to like the idea.</i>

18:33.712 --> 18:35.423
So, you know, in other words, when...

18:35.464 --> 18:37.300
when you have friends over,
you know, and you're...

18:37.341 --> 18:38.926
you're listening to music and they want

18:38.968 --> 18:41.387
to steal your music and
copy your movies or...

18:41.429 --> 18:43.931
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

18:43.973 --> 18:47.684
It just neutralizes that so
it's not even a threat anymore.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.728
It's called Fakeblock.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.688
- Great name. Right?
- Yeah, well, you know,

18:51.730 --> 18:53.065
it's super low-hanging fruit.

18:53.107 --> 18:54.566
Someone's going to do it.

18:54.608 --> 18:56.693
We're just trying to
be those guys, you know?

18:57.778 --> 18:59.196
<i>And, impressed with his</i>

18:59.238 --> 19:01.157
<i>- own invention...
- It's a fake profile</i>

19:01.198 --> 19:02.908
that leads hackers away
from your actual data.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.701
<i>He set about making an
impossible dream a reality.</i>

19:04.743 --> 19:05.953
You mean something that keeps

19:05.995 --> 19:07.371
everything on the Internet private

19:07.413 --> 19:08.831
and protects everyone's digital rights?

19:08.872 --> 19:10.124
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.459
Everyone has something

19:11.500 --> 19:13.377
that they want removed from the Internet.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.212
<i>George Michael certainly did.</i>

19:16.339 --> 19:17.881
<i>And if the new software served</i>

19:17.923 --> 19:19.967
<i>no other person than removing this... </i>

19:21.927 --> 19:24.054
<i>it would be worth it.</i>

19:24.096 --> 19:26.056
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

19:26.098 --> 19:27.433
I mean, if we could
make something like that,

19:27.475 --> 19:29.018
it could be bigger than Facebook.

19:29.059 --> 19:30.727
I mean, who wouldn't
want something like that?

19:30.769 --> 19:31.979
You think you can do it?

19:32.021 --> 19:33.605
No.

19:33.647 --> 19:36.108
No, of course not. No.

19:36.150 --> 19:37.985
I mean, this is my chance with Maeby,

19:38.027 --> 19:39.903
and I can't even get rid of my own father.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.572
You know, what if we just did
a vote... just the roommates?

19:42.614 --> 19:44.741
We do a quick vote, and
it's, "Ciao, Fathero."

19:44.783 --> 19:47.036
He's going to know who voted against him.

19:47.077 --> 19:50.706
Not if I get him to vote against himself.

19:51.665 --> 19:53.042
Why would he do that?

19:53.083 --> 19:54.502
No, he wouldn't. He... I...

19:54.543 --> 19:56.128
I was just leaning back,
so it looked like I...

19:56.170 --> 19:57.629
I got this chair again, didn't I?

19:57.671 --> 20:00.174
Maybe I just need to be clear and just say,

20:00.216 --> 20:01.717
"I'm putting up a wall.

20:01.758 --> 20:04.053
We need to rework our whole system here."

20:04.094 --> 20:06.722
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

20:06.763 --> 20:09.558
<i>And, long story short, Michael did end up</i>

20:09.599 --> 20:12.436
<i>embracing the
voting-out-a-roommate idea.</i>

20:12.478 --> 20:14.063
And it's, "Adios, brothiero."

20:14.104 --> 20:15.481
It cannot fail.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.570
That was fun.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.905
Did he look betrayed to you?

20:22.946 --> 20:24.407
He kind of always looks that way.

20:24.448 --> 20:27.326
I'm going to catch the bus.

20:27.368 --> 20:29.286
- Bye.
- Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.080
Are you going to come by on Thursday or... ?

20:31.121 --> 20:34.124
Um, I don't think so. I
have this thing in L.A.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.751
Well, can you blow it off? I
mean, you know, you might want

20:35.792 --> 20:37.503
to get "graduating high
school" out of the way.

20:37.545 --> 20:40.423
Well, I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award at this gala.

20:40.464 --> 20:43.509
Well, you might want to get that
out of the way, too, I guess.

20:43.551 --> 20:44.927
Yeah.

20:44.968 --> 20:46.678
Hey, you want me to go
with you to that or... ?

20:46.720 --> 20:48.597
Yeah, I can pick you up at your place.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.183
Oh, they're actually
shooting a thing at my place.

20:51.225 --> 20:53.102
<i>As it turns out, they'd end up</i>

20:53.143 --> 20:54.686
<i>- just clubbing a Thing.
- Oh!</i>

20:54.728 --> 20:57.106
You know what? Yeah, that
might actually be a good idea.

20:57.147 --> 20:59.066
Because I can't bring
any of my friends without

20:59.108 --> 21:00.484
getting permission
slips from their parents.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.652
Well, that's not really a problem for me.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.030
Yeah, 'cause you just
betrayed yours, right?

21:05.072 --> 21:06.949
MAEBY (chuckling): Awesome.

21:09.826 --> 21:12.162
<i>George Michael and Maeby arrived</i>

21:12.204 --> 21:15.249
<i>at a hotel busy with three separate events.</i>

21:15.291 --> 21:16.584
(people laughing)

21:16.625 --> 21:19.086
GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing): No, no, no...

21:19.128 --> 21:22.172
Well, it's really nice to be
out with you as adults, you know?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.592
In Spain, they don't even eat
dinner until after 11: 00 p.m.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.594
Wow, Spain really changed you.

21:26.635 --> 21:28.053
Well, you grow up very quickly in Spain.

21:28.095 --> 21:29.721
Oh, my God, I know this guy. Hey.

21:29.763 --> 21:31.014
Hey, man. Hey.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.100
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

21:34.351 --> 21:36.562
What are you on?

21:38.105 --> 21:39.773
Oh, he's nobody.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.609
Oh. It's Justin.

21:41.650 --> 21:43.152
That's David Henrie.

21:43.193 --> 21:44.820
<i>He's Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place.</i>

21:44.861 --> 21:46.071
Hmm.

21:46.113 --> 21:48.365
It's on a lot in Spain.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.242
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

21:50.284 --> 21:51.535
who think they can still play fifth grade.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.911
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

21:52.953 --> 21:54.455
<i>And George Michael set out</i>

21:54.497 --> 21:56.873
<i>to re-unleash his overtly sexual persona.</i>

21:56.915 --> 21:59.793
Well, gentlemen, start your engines.

22:00.836 --> 22:01.962
<i>Buenas noches, pequeño Scarlet.</i>

22:02.004 --> 22:03.255
I will be needing a room, please.

22:03.297 --> 22:04.965
How many nights?

22:05.007 --> 22:06.425
Two. Sorry. No, just one night.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.552
I thought you were saying how many people.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.929
- And how many beds?
- Two.

22:10.971 --> 22:13.140
- Two.
- No. Uh, one bed.

22:13.182 --> 22:14.975
Why give her the option?
Keep it real simple.

22:15.017 --> 22:17.978
One bed, one night, two people,
let's solve for "X." (laughs)

22:18.020 --> 22:20.022
I hate young Hollywood.

22:20.063 --> 22:22.483
MAEBY: It's called Fakeblock, Mort.

22:22.525 --> 22:24.876
<i>- It's going to blow Schnoodle out of the water!
- And it was on his way back</i>

22:24.877 --> 22:26.487
- to Maeby that he heard her say...
- Fakeblock's the next big thing.

22:26.529 --> 22:29.657
- It's called Fakeblock!
- What's this? You're talking... talking about Fakeblock?

22:29.697 --> 22:32.117
-Oh. How does your privacy software work?
- Huh? It's private.

22:32.249 --> 22:34.627
<i>And that's how George
Michael not only met Rebel... </i>

22:34.668 --> 22:37.421
I don't want people to
know that I'm doing this.

22:37.463 --> 22:38.838
<i>But finally found a way to prove</i>

22:38.880 --> 22:41.425
<i>to Maeby that he was a risk taker.</i>

22:41.467 --> 22:44.010
Yes. Yes. George Maharis.

22:44.052 --> 22:46.555
<i>Only to discover, moments later... </i>

22:46.597 --> 22:47.765
<i>- Perfecto!
- ... that she was dating</i>

22:47.805 --> 22:50.726
<i>- an even bigger risk taker.
- De nada.</i>

22:50.768 --> 22:52.978
That's my undercover cop boyfriend.

22:53.019 --> 22:54.396
I'm trying to get him in bed.

22:54.438 --> 22:55.813
Boyfriend?

22:55.855 --> 22:59.359
So funny that didn't come up in the car.

22:59.401 --> 23:01.528
So, how does it work?

23:01.570 --> 23:03.863
Huh? How does what work?

23:03.905 --> 23:05.658
Your privacy software.

23:05.699 --> 23:08.285
How does it protect you from piracy?

23:08.327 --> 23:09.953
Oh, I don't know.

23:09.995 --> 23:12.247
Don't worry about it.

23:12.289 --> 23:15.167
No, no, no. No, you
really piqued my interest.

23:15.208 --> 23:17.628
I'm sorry.

23:17.670 --> 23:20.172
<i>And discouraged that he'd lost Maeby,</i>

23:20.213 --> 23:23.300
<i>he tried to salvage his night</i>

23:23.342 --> 23:25.678
<i>by taking a picture of Gibby from "iCarly."</i>

23:25.719 --> 23:28.096
<i>As he was doing this,
however, this happened.</i>

23:28.138 --> 23:30.516
(loud explosion, people screaming)

23:30.557 --> 23:33.185
<i>The explosion caused an electrical surge</i>

23:33.226 --> 23:35.646
<i>rendering the Schnoodle
software inoperable.</i>

23:35.688 --> 23:38.357
<i>Which, to those who saw him,</i>

23:38.398 --> 23:40.651
<i>seemed like a genius act of cyber sabotage,</i>

23:40.693 --> 23:42.944
<i>which led to this.</i>

23:42.986 --> 23:45.823
- What happened?
- Ah, it's dead.

23:45.863 --> 23:48.325
That geek Maharis
destroyed the whole thing.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.994
And you know why? Just because he could.

23:51.036 --> 23:53.871
Those Internet geniuses...
that's what they do. I'm ruined.

23:53.913 --> 23:56.166
I'll probably never get
to drive the Schnoodle car.

23:56.208 --> 23:58.001
We should work together.

23:58.043 --> 23:59.628
- No.
- Smart.

23:59.670 --> 24:04.257
<i>And a few days later,
it would lead to this.</i>

24:04.299 --> 24:06.593
I'm John Beard. Here's
your 15 seconds of news.

24:06.635 --> 24:08.178
Fakeblock's mystery man, George Maharis,

24:08.220 --> 24:10.430
may have just found a way to screw a cap

24:10.472 --> 24:13.183
on the Internet, and
investors are lining up

24:13.225 --> 24:14.810
to fill the company's tank with money,

24:14.852 --> 24:16.478
even though he himself remains anonymous.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.314
That's all the news
that's fit to pump. I quit.

24:19.356 --> 24:21.400
<i>NARRATOR: By the time</i>

24:21.441 --> 24:23.360
<i>George Michael returned tocampus,</i>

24:23.402 --> 24:26.196
<i>even his roommate had heard
of George Maharis' Fakeblock.</i>

24:26.238 --> 24:27.740
This George Maharis guy stole our name,

24:27.781 --> 24:29.700
but we have it registered,

24:29.742 --> 24:31.493
so we can sell it to him for a fortune.

24:31.535 --> 24:32.745
No, I am George Maharis!

24:32.786 --> 24:34.204
I'm behind the whole thing.

24:34.246 --> 24:35.748
I... I wanted to impress Maeby,

24:35.789 --> 24:37.999
so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.668
Why would you do that?

24:39.710 --> 24:41.378
You know, it's like the
time that you told that girl

24:41.420 --> 24:43.088
that you were George Takei's son.

24:43.129 --> 24:45.716
Well, it's too late.
This thing's taking off.

24:45.758 --> 24:48.677
They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

24:48.719 --> 24:50.512
That was a coincidence. It
must have been a power surge.

24:50.554 --> 24:52.681
Well, we got to get something... at least

24:52.723 --> 24:54.307
get our five grand back.

24:54.349 --> 24:56.059
Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in three dollars.

24:56.101 --> 24:58.061
Well, you may have put in
the most money to Fakeblock,

24:58.103 --> 24:59.813
but I put in the first three dollars,

24:59.855 --> 25:01.273
so that makes you a hop-on.

25:01.314 --> 25:02.982
No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

25:03.024 --> 25:05.569
and I know exactly who
you're trying to hop on to.

25:05.611 --> 25:07.195
- Maeby.
- Maeby.

25:07.237 --> 25:10.741
Yeah, well, you know
she's dating a cop, right?

25:10.783 --> 25:12.242
- Yeah, she likes risk takers, like the P...
-MAEBY: Hi.

25:12.284 --> 25:13.869
Hound...

25:13.911 --> 25:16.121
Keep moving. Can you believe this?

25:16.162 --> 25:18.039
<i>- Maeby was excited...
- Fakeblock! It's exploding!</i>

25:18.081 --> 25:19.875
<i>- ... but George Michael knew
- I got my PR company fanning it</i>

25:19.917 --> 25:21.334
<i>the stakes were too high
for him to continue the lie.</i>

25:21.376 --> 25:22.502
And I even cashed in a favor

25:22.544 --> 25:23.629
to get us mentioned on "Mad Money."

25:23.670 --> 25:25.046
You know, I think we just might want

25:25.088 --> 25:27.132
to slow down a little bit
on the whole Fakeblock thing

25:27.173 --> 25:29.092
'cause I'm still not 100% finished with it.

25:29.134 --> 25:30.469
Well, how finished are you with it?

25:30.510 --> 25:32.721
200%? 500%

25:32.763 --> 25:34.264
I also feel like I'm not 100% finished

25:34.306 --> 25:35.933
<i>- with your math tutoring.
- And then Maeby said something</i>

25:35.973 --> 25:39.853
<i>- that made his change his mind.
- Do we have those books here?</i>

25:39.895 --> 25:41.396
MAEBY: I trust you, George Michael.

25:41.438 --> 25:42.481
I would not get into bed with you

25:42.522 --> 25:43.941
on this thing if I didn't trust you.

25:43.981 --> 25:47.193
No. Yeah, of... of course
you can trust me in bed.

25:47.235 --> 25:48.946
No, I mean, I trust you
not to take advantage of me.

25:48.986 --> 25:52.407
No. I wouldn't. We would...
we would just lie there.

25:52.449 --> 25:55.076
We'd just lie there? I mean,
I'm talking about business.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.497
So am I. That's why we
would just lie there.

25:58.538 --> 26:00.624
Okay. (laughs) 'Cause I was going to say,

26:00.666 --> 26:02.083
when you become an Internet billionaire,

26:02.125 --> 26:04.544
you could do whatever
you want with me in bed.

26:04.586 --> 26:06.588
<i>It was that. That's what
made him change his mind.</i>

26:06.630 --> 26:08.882
<i>- I will. I will.
- And if it was so wrong to lie,</i>

26:08.924 --> 26:11.134
<i>surely he would receive some sort of sign.</i>

26:11.176 --> 26:12.970
Oh, hey, I should get this.

26:13.010 --> 26:15.263
<i>- But that wasn't it.
- Hi, Uncle Gob.</i>

26:15.305 --> 26:16.682
<i>That was his uncle Gob wanting
to meet him at a gay club</i>

26:16.723 --> 26:18.266
<i>- to tell him his father
- I need to see you tonight.</i>

26:18.308 --> 26:20.602
<i>- Was anxious to see him.
- It's about your father and you.</i>

26:20.644 --> 26:22.061
Really? Is... is he upset?

26:22.103 --> 26:24.773
- GOB: Do I seem like a clown to you?
- I got it.

26:24.815 --> 26:26.358
<i>George Michael was
worried, and even more so,</i>

26:26.399 --> 26:28.610
<i>when he caught up with
his uncle at a magic club.</i>

26:28.652 --> 26:30.362
That Fakeblock thing will scrub it away.

26:30.403 --> 26:31.989
You know about Fakeblock?
You know that's my software.

26:32.029 --> 26:34.407
I wonder if my dad
thinks I'm blowing him off

26:34.449 --> 26:36.493
because that's starting to take off now.

26:36.535 --> 26:38.411
Well, you should go
find out 'cause I do know

26:38.453 --> 26:40.706
that your dad is really,
really, really upset with you.

26:40.747 --> 26:42.499
He is upset? I asked you that.

26:42.541 --> 26:44.668
That was literally the
first thing I asked you.

26:44.710 --> 26:46.712
So you're giving me these crazy...

26:46.753 --> 26:48.171
Mad?

26:48.213 --> 26:50.215
<i>So, it was a very shaken George Michael</i>

26:50.256 --> 26:52.801
<i>who arrived later at the Ealing Club... </i>

26:52.843 --> 26:54.344
What do you mean, I'm already
up there? Obviously, I'm not...

26:54.386 --> 26:56.095
<i>as a frustrated Andy
Richter was having trouble</i>

26:56.137 --> 26:57.806
already up there because I'm here.

26:57.848 --> 26:59.349
<i>Getting into the club he was a member of.</i>

26:59.391 --> 27:01.768
It's my stupid brother!
He looks just like me.

27:01.810 --> 27:04.396
I'll just go up, I'll find
him, I'll... Oh, come on.

27:04.437 --> 27:05.731
Oh, hey, Donny!

27:05.772 --> 27:07.106
Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings.

27:07.148 --> 27:08.525
Yeah, okay, all right.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.235
Hey, come. I'm... I'm his guest.

27:10.276 --> 27:11.695
Is this man your guest?

27:11.737 --> 27:13.488
Oh, no, no. I'm just meeting my dad here.

27:13.530 --> 27:14.907
Oh, screw this. I'm going up.

27:14.948 --> 27:16.533
- Oh, come on.
- Going up, going up.

27:16.575 --> 27:18.493
Oh, come on!

27:18.535 --> 27:20.286
Oh, some Openings child you are, man!

27:20.328 --> 27:22.831
<i>And George Michael girded himself</i>

27:22.873 --> 27:25.417
<i>for his first meeting with his father</i>

27:25.458 --> 27:27.335
<i>since he voted him out of the dorm.</i>

27:27.377 --> 27:28.962
Hi. Yeah, just a sea-breeze, please.

27:29.004 --> 27:30.589
Make it a strong one.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.007
Put some stank on that.

27:32.049 --> 27:33.508
George?

27:33.550 --> 27:35.510
George Maharis?

27:35.552 --> 27:37.345
<i>And that's when he heard</i>

27:37.387 --> 27:40.807
<i>the name he'd forgotten
he'd given out as his own.</i>

27:40.849 --> 27:43.351
<i>So he tried not to act surprised to hear it</i>

27:43.393 --> 27:44.770
<i>when he saw it was Rebel.</i>

27:44.811 --> 27:46.187
I see you.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.023
<i>Unfortunately, that meant being stuck</i>

27:48.065 --> 27:49.608
<i>affecting a blasé attitude.</i>

27:49.649 --> 27:51.150
Rebel Alley?

27:51.192 --> 27:52.485
We spoke three days ago.

27:52.527 --> 27:54.529
I know, I know. I remember.

27:54.571 --> 27:56.949
- Are you a member here?
- No, I'm not.

27:56.990 --> 27:59.034
No, I just walked in past
the big black security guard.

27:59.076 --> 28:00.493
<i>All of which now worked against him.</i>

28:00.535 --> 28:02.203
Okay, you know what?

28:02.245 --> 28:04.039
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

28:04.081 --> 28:06.541
You're a bigger jerk than
Andy Richter over there!

28:06.583 --> 28:07.960
ANDY: Loosen up, bitch.

28:08.001 --> 28:09.502
I'm Andy Richter!

28:09.544 --> 28:13.298
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

28:13.339 --> 28:15.467
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry. I... I...

28:15.508 --> 28:17.928
You know, I'm in the
middle of a whole thing

28:17.970 --> 28:19.846
with my dad right now, and I, um...

28:19.888 --> 28:22.808
I didn't mean to be...
however I just came off.

28:22.849 --> 28:23.976
Badly.

28:24.017 --> 28:25.435
Well, I'm sorry, you know.

28:25.477 --> 28:27.520
I've never met a beautiful actress before.

28:27.562 --> 28:28.772
Oh, so you do know who I am?

28:28.814 --> 28:30.356
God, of course I know who you are!

28:30.398 --> 28:32.358
You were in the remake
of "Dangerous Cousins."

28:32.400 --> 28:34.444
I signed up to Netflix
because of that movie.

28:34.486 --> 28:36.071
Uh-huh.

28:36.113 --> 28:38.406
I think I was thrown that you
were interested in who I am.

28:38.448 --> 28:39.992
Well, you are George Maharis.

28:40.033 --> 28:42.243
- Everyone's talking about your software company.
- Oh, yeah.

28:42.285 --> 28:45.914
I'm sure women are just
throwing themselves at your feet.

28:45.956 --> 28:49.417
Well, you know, I, uh... I
prefer a woman who aims higher.

28:49.459 --> 28:52.004
(Rebel laughs loudly,
George Michael laughs)

28:52.045 --> 28:54.756
- That was funny.
- Yeah, I know.

28:54.798 --> 28:56.091
- That was good. That was...
- Smooth.

28:56.133 --> 28:58.384
Smooth. Hey, we have
the same taste in words.

28:58.426 --> 29:00.804
Okay, should we get a drink? I'm buying.

29:00.846 --> 29:03.598
I don't want you to think
I'm after you for your money.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.058
<i>George Michael was
thrown by what was clearly</i>

29:05.100 --> 29:06.309
<i>Rebel's stated interest in him.</i>

29:06.351 --> 29:07.853
MAN: George Michael? George Michael?

29:07.894 --> 29:09.312
<i>Which is perhaps why he ignored the page... </i>

29:09.354 --> 29:10.772
<i>- MAN: George Michael?
- ... that he assumed</i>

29:10.814 --> 29:12.816
- was from his father.
- George Michael?

29:12.858 --> 29:16.319
Is George Michael here?
Is George Michael here?

29:16.361 --> 29:17.779
(laughing): Oh, God.

29:17.821 --> 29:19.156
Just remind me not to go in the men's room!

29:19.197 --> 29:21.491
(laughter)

29:21.533 --> 29:22.742
Uh, would you excuse me?

29:22.784 --> 29:24.327
I... I'm just gonna use the men's room.

29:24.369 --> 29:26.454
<i>- Okay.
- And while checking</i>

29:26.496 --> 29:28.123
<i>his messages, he got some good news.</i>

29:28.165 --> 29:30.458
MICHAEL: Hey, buddy,
it's Dad. Um, I am having

29:30.500 --> 29:32.085
real trouble getting up there.

29:32.127 --> 29:34.379
Uh, this traffic is unbelievable.

29:34.420 --> 29:37.674
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

29:37.716 --> 29:40.177
Call me back when you get this?

29:40.218 --> 29:43.596
<i>But while Michael was
leaving a second message,</i>

29:43.638 --> 29:44.973
<i>George Michael left one for him.</i>

29:45.015 --> 29:47.225
- (phone chimes)
- Oh. Hey, hang on. This is you.

29:47.266 --> 29:49.144
Hey, it's me. You know what?

29:49.186 --> 29:51.646
I bet we're sitting in the exact
same traffic; this is a mess.

29:51.688 --> 29:53.398
<i>Now hoping to ensure</i>

29:53.439 --> 29:55.150
<i>that his father didn't
make it to their meeting.</i>

29:55.192 --> 29:56.735
Maybe that's better. Oh,
God, they're forcing us off.

29:56.776 --> 29:58.195
Oh, God, they're forcing us off,

29:58.236 --> 29:59.696
but you know, we can
just do this another time

29:59.738 --> 30:02.032
if that works. Maybe that's better.

30:02.074 --> 30:04.659
Oh, they're closing the
lanes. Oh, this is beautiful.

30:04.701 --> 30:07.954
Same traffic. Unreal.

30:07.996 --> 30:10.082
Unreal. Kind of looking around for you now.

30:10.123 --> 30:12.042
Maybe you're right near me.

30:12.084 --> 30:13.626
Anyhow, if you get this,

30:13.668 --> 30:17.380
maybe we will just meet... somewhere else.

30:17.422 --> 30:18.965
Gonna hang up now.

30:19.007 --> 30:21.134
I'm going to video this
and send it in to the news.

30:21.176 --> 30:22.802
Glad you're getting some footage of this,

30:22.844 --> 30:24.554
'cause I can't really
get a good angle myself.

30:24.596 --> 30:26.890
They're forcing us off here
like a bunch of animals.

30:26.932 --> 30:28.975
You know, maybe we'll do this
another time, 'cause this is...

30:29.017 --> 30:30.852
It's sad to say, but it's left me...

30:30.894 --> 30:32.437
animals. You know maybe
we'll do this another time.

30:32.478 --> 30:33.772
It's sad to say,

30:33.813 --> 30:35.190
but it's left me pretty shaken up.

30:35.232 --> 30:37.525
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

30:37.567 --> 30:39.318
'Cause, you know, they don't
have any choice in the matter.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.362
- (phone chimes)
- Well, I'll tell you what.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.948
I feel worse for the parents, okay?

30:42.989 --> 30:44.449
Probably the kids thought

30:44.490 --> 30:46.492
that they could fly the
plane all by themselves.

30:46.534 --> 30:49.704
Bet you 500 bucks they find
a dead kid behind the stick.

30:49.746 --> 30:52.624
You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap

30:52.665 --> 30:54.960
whose only fault was
loving that kid too much

30:55.001 --> 30:56.419
and letting him fly the plane.

30:56.461 --> 30:58.337
Next thing he knows,
he's bouncing of the top

30:58.379 --> 31:00.339
of the Sports Chalet onto
the express lane of the 605.

31:00.381 --> 31:02.217
<i>- I'll bet you 500 bucks.
- Michael was hurt</i>

31:02.259 --> 31:05.511
<i>- and on his way out...
- See you. I'm out of your hair.</i>

31:05.553 --> 31:07.346
<i>When he heard something
that cheered him up.</i>

31:07.388 --> 31:09.307
The guy that was harassing
Rebel... he's on his way down.

31:09.348 --> 31:10.892
Say, Rebel?

31:10.934 --> 31:13.186
Hey, Andy Richter.

31:13.228 --> 31:14.896
Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?

31:14.938 --> 31:16.648
Oh, yeah. I... I'm Andy.

31:16.689 --> 31:19.234
So, I know him. Can I
get on your membership,

31:19.276 --> 31:20.986
- and can you vouch for me? Okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

31:21.027 --> 31:22.195
Whatever you want... it's on Andy.

31:22.237 --> 31:23.571
Thank you.

31:23.613 --> 31:25.157
It's on this rich (bleep)hole.

31:25.198 --> 31:26.616
Bye.

31:26.658 --> 31:28.451
<i>But before Michael could find Rebel,</i>

31:28.493 --> 31:30.996
<i>he ran into the man, that at that point,</i>

31:31.037 --> 31:33.081
<i>he still thought was her lover.</i>

31:33.123 --> 31:34.373
Ron!

31:34.415 --> 31:36.709
- Hey.
- No, no. It's Michael.

31:36.751 --> 31:39.963
Michael Bluth... doing the
film about my family and...

31:40.005 --> 31:42.048
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature, though?

31:42.090 --> 31:43.382
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Oh.

31:43.424 --> 31:44.717
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

31:44.759 --> 31:46.136
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

31:46.178 --> 31:47.553
but I think that he's blowing me off.

31:47.595 --> 31:50.056
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

31:50.098 --> 31:52.267
Well, you know, a month
ago, I would have told you

31:52.309 --> 31:54.686
that he and I were exactly
the same, that we were twins.

31:54.727 --> 31:59.482
But now, I wouldn't even
think of my son as my brother.

31:59.524 --> 32:01.734
You know, the thing is...

32:01.776 --> 32:04.279
He's busy.
