00:06.777 --> 00:11.311
(Children speaking indistinctly)

00:11.312 --> 00:13.643
(Boy) Helen!

00:13.644 --> 00:16.486
Let me go! Let me
go! (Car door closes)

00:16.487 --> 00:18.788
Let me go! Let me go!

00:18.789 --> 00:20.690
No! Noah!

00:20.691 --> 00:23.523
Oh! (Grunts) Get off me!

00:23.524 --> 00:27.557
No! Noah!

00:27.558 --> 00:30.130
No! Let me go! Let me go!

00:30.131 --> 00:32.062
No!

00:32.063 --> 00:33.663
Noah! Aah!

00:33.664 --> 00:36.666
Helen! Let me go!
(Police radio chatter)

00:36.667 --> 00:40.170
(Voice echoes) Let me go!

00:40.171 --> 00:41.171
(Car door closes)

00:41.172 --> 00:44.214
So your mom decided
to run again this year.

00:44.215 --> 00:45.515
Good for her.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.217
Bad for me.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.719
Two months of fund-raising
and glad-handing hell.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.051
Dr. Hunt, not a moment too soon.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.553
Where's Sam?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.054
Training at Quantico.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.056
It's a great opportunity,
but really bad timing.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.559
I hear we have a hit-and-run
and a missing child.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.131
You're looking at Helen Martin.

01:01.132 --> 01:04.334
Live-in nanny to a
6-year-old boy... Noah Parker.

01:04.335 --> 01:07.137
She and Noah were last
seen down by the swings

01:07.138 --> 01:09.499
about 30 minutes ago.
What do your witnesses say?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.501
Well, they're all nannies.
Two of them heard screams.

01:11.502 --> 01:14.144
But the one in the
middle saw a silver truck.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.746
We're bringing 'em down
to the station for statements.

01:16.747 --> 01:19.249
Could use your help
on that. Yeah, sure.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.611
What do you make of it? My
guess is, he came for the kid,

01:21.612 --> 01:25.415
Helen got in the way of the car, and he
just ran her down. That's mastoid bruising.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.617
Looks like a
basilar skull fracture.

01:27.618 --> 01:30.660
She was hit at a high speed.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.662
These scratches here?

01:32.663 --> 01:35.125
These aren't from the impact.

01:35.126 --> 01:37.127
Defensive wounds.
There was a struggle first.

01:37.128 --> 01:40.230
She was fighting for the boy.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.702
An inhaler. Helen had asthma.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.705
No. This mask is
designed for kids.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.177
(Man speaks indistinctly)

01:47.178 --> 01:49.339
Noah has asthma.

01:49.340 --> 01:53.183
And he's without his inhaler.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.685
(Morris) I know this
must be difficult for you.

01:55.686 --> 01:59.889
I can assure you, we are using
every resource at our disposal.

01:59.890 --> 02:03.253
Now you are certain that this
is what your son was wearing?

02:03.254 --> 02:06.256
Noah's in a phase where
he only likes two shirts.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.558
He had to be wearing
the skateboard robot.

02:08.559 --> 02:11.561
We're also gonna need
a sample of his d.N.A...

02:11.562 --> 02:15.305
A... a comb or a shirt,
something he wore...

02:15.306 --> 02:17.307
And also his dental records.

02:17.308 --> 02:20.170
Why? What else do you know?
Have you found something?

02:20.171 --> 02:22.242
(Man) We don't
know anything yet.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.744
Detective Morris is taking
standard precautions.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.917
Jennifer, Tom, this is, uh,
special agent Derek ames, FBI.

02:27.918 --> 02:30.280
(Ames) Please sit.

02:30.281 --> 02:33.152
(Sighs)

02:33.153 --> 02:35.185
What can you tell
us about our son?

02:35.186 --> 02:37.727
Nothing yet. That's
why I've come to you,

02:37.728 --> 02:39.729
so we can learn
as much as possible

02:39.730 --> 02:41.561
as we start our investigation.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.734
There's more than a 50% chance

02:44.735 --> 02:47.897
that whoever did this is
someone you and your son know,

02:47.898 --> 02:50.471
maybe even trust.

02:52.303 --> 02:54.844
Why don't we start with Helen?

02:54.845 --> 02:57.307
Helen was a Saint.

02:57.308 --> 03:00.380
She loved Noah so
much. She was family to us.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.852
Helen's taken care of
Noah since he was born.

03:02.853 --> 03:05.215
She died trying to save our son.

03:05.216 --> 03:07.317
I'm... i'm... I'm sure of that.

03:07.318 --> 03:09.319
What about someone
who knew Helen,

03:09.320 --> 03:11.591
someone who might
take advantage of her?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.594
Uh, Helen didn't have
any family that we knew of.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.497
As for friends, i... The
truth is, we didn't pry.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.198
(Ames) Of course.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.332
I've worked on missing
persons cases for 20 years.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.235
You should know, you're
doing everything right.

03:25.236 --> 03:26.536
The more you tell us,

03:26.537 --> 03:29.739
the better the chances
we'll find Noah alive.

03:29.740 --> 03:32.742
Now before we go on,

03:32.743 --> 03:36.616
the best thing for us all is
if we gather Noah's records.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.319
Would you mind?

03:43.524 --> 03:47.226
Derek ames, the swami of calm.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.359
People find good
odds comforting.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.901
They can focus on
making their hope a reality.

03:51.902 --> 03:54.404
Three-quarters of
abducted children who die

03:54.405 --> 03:57.407
are killed within the first
three hours of their abduction.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.639
How's that for odds?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.341
We don't have time.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.413
I never said we did.

04:03.414 --> 04:06.376
We'll need all
their contacts asap.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.278
Where you going?

04:08.279 --> 04:10.280
To see your m.E. About the body.

04:10.281 --> 04:12.282
Hopefully, he'll have a theory.

04:12.283 --> 04:14.854
You mean she,
and as for theories...

04:14.855 --> 04:16.887
Be careful what you wish for.

04:21.332 --> 04:22.532
(Camera shutter clicks)

04:22.533 --> 04:25.335
(Clicking)

04:25.336 --> 04:29.339
Fractures start
48 centimeters up.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.341
(Curtis) Ground
clearance for a light truck,

04:31.342 --> 04:32.802
silver paint chips.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.644
Bruises on the
thigh are angular,

04:34.645 --> 04:36.476
which could be from a headlight.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.409
Can you match those imprints to a
make and model? Give us a few hours,

04:39.410 --> 04:42.413
and we'll tell you if it's
standard or luxury. Deal.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.357
If you're from the
bureau, I'm not ready

04:47.358 --> 04:50.360
to announce cause of death.
Shame. And I came all this way.

04:50.361 --> 04:53.393
I was promised you'd
have a theory. You mind?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.395
What I have is a
woman who threw herself

04:55.396 --> 04:57.397
at a speeding truck
to protect a child.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.599
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm Derek ames.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.071
I'm busy, Derek ames.

05:02.072 --> 05:04.474
(Scoffs) You want my theory?

05:04.475 --> 05:06.676
You're working too fast.

05:06.677 --> 05:09.409
You don't have kids, do you?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.841
There's a boy out
there who's terrified

05:11.842 --> 05:13.843
counting on us to find him,

05:13.844 --> 05:16.486
and you think I'm working
too fast? One missed detail,

05:16.487 --> 05:19.689
you hold back the
whole investigation.

05:19.690 --> 05:22.452
You can't let your heart
get the better of you.

05:22.453 --> 05:24.924
Nobody has ever
accused me of that.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.796
Hmm.

05:26.797 --> 05:31.461
There is bruising
on the right shoulder.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.332
Looks like finger impressions.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.605
Maybe a couple of days old.

05:35.606 --> 05:37.467
Okay. That's helpful.

05:37.468 --> 05:38.938
I'm gonna go back

05:38.939 --> 05:40.940
and take another
look at Helen's room.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.074
Uh... I could do with an
extra pair of sharp eyes.

05:45.716 --> 05:48.778
Sure. After I get
cause of death.

05:48.779 --> 05:51.452
Hmm. It's a date.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.655
She was so proud of Noah.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.357
Every prayer group, she'd
have another story about him,

05:58.358 --> 05:59.729
another picture.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.861
Did she have any
enemies you know of?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.362
I doubt it.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.365
But I don't know her as
well as her friends at church.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.069
Enemies? No. She was loved.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.801
Someone didn't love her.

06:11.802 --> 06:15.705
They left an imprint of
their hand on her neck.

06:15.706 --> 06:18.648
She tried to bring her
boyfriend to services once.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.380
He seemed like bad news.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.952
He never came back.

06:22.953 --> 06:24.614
Do you remember his name?

06:24.615 --> 06:26.716
Oscar Mendez.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.419
Helen's been seeing
him for a couple of years.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.963
Sometimes she would
show up with bruises.

06:38.829 --> 06:41.771
Helen had a good heart.

06:41.772 --> 06:44.404
She assumed
everyone else did, too.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.110
(Morris) Oscar Mendez...
Two drunk and disorderlies,

06:51.111 --> 06:53.683
served five months...
Accomplice to assault.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.985
You think I took the Parker
boy? Go check my place.

06:55.986 --> 06:57.987
Right. 'Cause that's
exactly where you'd take him.

06:57.988 --> 07:00.550
Look, I knew this was why
you guys brought me in here.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.522
Look, the boy's
all over the news.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.525
Everybody saying it's a kidnapping.
And what would you call it, huh?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.597
Murder of the woman I love.

07:07.598 --> 07:11.200
If this was just about Helen,
just about a nanny from Camden,

07:11.201 --> 07:13.202
you and I would
never be talking.

07:13.203 --> 07:15.905
Mm-hmm. Want to talk
about this? (Taps table)

07:15.906 --> 07:18.508
This is your hand
impression on her neck.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.210
I would never hurt Helen, man.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.874
Her friends tell us otherwise.

07:25.676 --> 07:27.717
All right. All right.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.449
Yeah, we got in an
argument, all right?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.182
Helen told me she was
leaving town. Oh, come on.

07:33.183 --> 07:34.684
You'd been fighting.

07:34.685 --> 07:37.527
What better way to get even
than to take the kid she loves?

07:37.528 --> 07:40.490
I'm not perfect, but she was.

07:40.491 --> 07:43.493
And she was all that
I had going for me.

07:43.494 --> 07:46.997
Why... would I
want to lose that?

07:50.571 --> 07:53.573
(Police radio chatter)

07:53.574 --> 07:55.044
(People speak indistinctly)

07:55.045 --> 07:58.948
(Indistinct conversations)

07:58.949 --> 08:01.010
Ah. Cause of death...
Transection of the cord

08:01.011 --> 08:03.683
at the foramen Magnum
due to blunt force trauma.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.586
So she was killed on impact?

08:06.587 --> 08:09.188
Correct. Find anything
in Helen's room? Not a lot,

08:09.189 --> 08:11.791
except a few discarded
photos of Oscar Mendez.

08:11.792 --> 08:16.596
So she dumps him, and
then he tries to exact revenge.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.628
How are the parents holding up?

08:18.629 --> 08:20.530
Well, good as any.
(Man) Sir, I'll take those.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.902
I'm working them for as
much information as I can.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.576
Sensitive. And you
think I move too fast?

08:26.577 --> 08:28.678
At the end of the day,

08:28.679 --> 08:31.681
the boy's either in their
arms or on your table.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.683
Deeds not words.

08:33.684 --> 08:35.615
(Cell phone rings)

08:35.616 --> 08:37.887
Start tracing. (Ring)

08:37.888 --> 08:39.989
(Man) Recording to channel
1. (Man) Triangulating the area.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.691
(Ring) (People
speaking indistinctly)

08:41.692 --> 08:42.892
Hello.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.724
(Noah) Mommy.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.196
Noah, where are
you? Mommy, help!

08:47.197 --> 08:49.599
(Man) Put down the phone! Noah?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.562
(Line disconnects) Noah?!

08:53.103 --> 08:56.807
Didn't get it. Not enough time.

09:02.613 --> 09:03.913
(Fabric snaps)

09:03.914 --> 09:06.546
♪♪♪

09:17.557 --> 09:20.559
Okay, so phone tracking
only took us to north Philly.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.561
And nobody recognized
the kidnapper's voice.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.563
Then this will help.
Noah's kidnapper drove

09:24.564 --> 09:26.565
a 2007 pickup with
silver metallic finish

09:26.566 --> 09:28.567
and tinted glass on
the side windows.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.800
But that describes, like,
10,000 trucks around Philly.

09:30.801 --> 09:32.802
Except the killer's car

09:32.803 --> 09:36.045
left these marks
on Helen's thigh.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.107
Now I took a transparency,

09:38.108 --> 09:41.080
rescaled it, blew it up,
overlaid it with thousands...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.052
Ethan, just show him.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.054
Right, right. Sorry
about that. Okay.

09:45.055 --> 09:47.016
Just give me a second.

09:47.017 --> 09:50.059
You see that? Yeah.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.822
You put that on top of that.
They're a perfect match.

09:52.823 --> 09:55.825
Never get in a hit-and-run with
aftermarket diamond plating.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.928
We will catch you. Good work.
Let's add it to the Amber alert.

09:58.929 --> 10:01.631
We already did, and we ran
it through the police database.

10:01.632 --> 10:04.634
Five guys in north Philly
have the exact same car.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.637
But only one has three
priors and a huge debt.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.138
(Clicks keyboard key)

10:09.139 --> 10:12.182
Meet Jason Peterson,
our creep at large.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.215
(Cell phone rings)

10:16.216 --> 10:18.047
(Ring)

10:18.048 --> 10:19.218
(Sighs)

10:19.219 --> 10:20.389
(Scoffs)

10:20.390 --> 10:22.251
(Cell phone beeps)

10:22.252 --> 10:24.694
I knew it.

10:24.695 --> 10:26.696
What does a mother have to do

10:26.697 --> 10:29.098
to have dinner with her
daughter? You cannot come in here.

10:29.099 --> 10:30.960
You've been ignoring me.

10:30.961 --> 10:32.261
That's impossible.

10:32.262 --> 10:34.163
Your election signs
are everywhere.

10:34.164 --> 10:36.165
Well, today is your lucky day.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.807
My dockets cleared early,

10:37.808 --> 10:39.809
and I have a
reservation at Paulo's.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.171
Oh, Paulo's. How
nice. And for how many?

10:42.172 --> 10:44.413
Well, I just thought a
friend would drop by.

10:44.414 --> 10:47.346
Let me guess.
Your publicist Sheila.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.319
Mom, we do this
every election year.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.722
Just ask. Go ahead and ask.

10:52.723 --> 10:57.156
Just talk to her for 20 minutes. I have
an uphill battle... I can't. I'm on a case.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.229
Well, it's not like she's gonna
get up off the table and leave.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.892
Megan, you're an integral
part of this campaign.

11:02.893 --> 11:06.365
30 minutes is all I need.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.068
Mother, there is
a child missing.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.101
Are you working on
the Noah Parker case?

11:12.102 --> 11:14.173
They just nabbed Jason
Peterson off the Amber alert.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.875
Bud's got him now.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.877
Get off me, man!
Shut up and move!

11:17.878 --> 11:19.408
Get off me!

11:19.409 --> 11:22.081
Son of a bitch pulled a knife
on me! (Speaks indistinctly)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.113
Yeah? (Grunts)

11:24.114 --> 11:26.115
Ah! I got this! I got it!

11:26.116 --> 11:27.416
Take this.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.190
Come on. Come on.

11:31.421 --> 11:34.093
Where is he, huh?
Where's the boy?

11:34.094 --> 11:37.096
Helen Martin's blood
is all over your truck.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.428
You are done. Now
where is the boy?

11:39.429 --> 11:41.831
(Chuckles) You'll never know.

11:41.832 --> 11:45.004
You don't care, do you?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.475
You don't even care

11:46.476 --> 11:48.477
that there's a boy out
there who might be dyin'.

11:48.478 --> 11:51.912
Hell, you don't even care
that I'm a cop. Well, fine.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.846
I'm not gonna care
either. (Clicks switch)

12:00.190 --> 12:02.351
Okay, what am I looking at?

12:02.352 --> 12:05.354
The material you
recovered from her nails...

12:05.355 --> 12:07.726
Sand, uh, detergent.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.458
That's a strawberry
seed, maybe from jelly.

12:09.459 --> 12:11.400
It's all just from
being a nanny.

12:11.401 --> 12:14.403
Nothing from the
struggle? What about this?

12:14.404 --> 12:16.836
What is that?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.908
Don't look at me.

12:18.909 --> 12:21.140
Isolate it, get it on a
slide, and then I'll...

12:21.141 --> 12:24.143
(cell phone rings)
Oh, speak of the devil.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.146
Hi. I was just about to call
you. (Peter) It'll have to wait.

12:27.147 --> 12:31.080
I need you to come to the precinct
right now. Why? What happened?

12:31.081 --> 12:33.423
Jason Peterson is dead.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.887
(Receiver clatters)

12:42.062 --> 12:43.362
(Elevator bell dings)

12:43.363 --> 12:46.065
Bud's with internal affairs.
He's already off the case.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.068
So I wouldn't go and talk
to him right now, okay?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.370
Me... how could
you let this happen?

12:51.371 --> 12:54.343
Can we not do this now? A boy's been
kidnapped, and you cannot control yourself

12:54.344 --> 12:57.807
long enough to get one
answer out of his kidnapper?

12:57.808 --> 13:01.450
I was interrogating the suspect,
and he went out like a light.

13:01.451 --> 13:04.353
Oh, you don't believe
me? Would you?

13:04.354 --> 13:06.455
(Peter) This is
not the time, okay?

13:06.456 --> 13:09.158
Look, I'm sure that came
from a place of concern,

13:09.159 --> 13:13.159
but bud is under a lot of pressure already. I... what
concerns me is, he couldn't handle this pressure.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.425
(Camera shutter clicks)

13:16.426 --> 13:18.427
Medics did
everything they could,

13:18.428 --> 13:20.129
but it was hopeless.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.201
C.p.r. Compressions
could explain those bruises.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.234
Not the ones on his neck.

13:25.235 --> 13:27.236
Look, Jason attacked
bud while he walked in.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.538
I mean, maybe he was
just defending himself.

13:29.539 --> 13:32.511
I suppose he had to knee him in the flank, too?
To subdue a suspect? Yeah. I've done it myself.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.885
Let's just keep to
the matter at hand.

13:35.886 --> 13:38.047
The only person who knows

13:38.048 --> 13:40.049
where the boy is hidden...

13:40.050 --> 13:42.191
Is now in your custody.

13:42.192 --> 13:46.326
Time to make a dead man speak.

13:50.861 --> 13:52.862
Derek was pretty
sure that this guy

13:52.863 --> 13:54.864
is somehow
connected to the family.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.465
Yeah, I've worked
with Derek before.

13:56.466 --> 14:00.139
He's pretty sure
about everything.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.242
Our kidnapper is
quite the smoker.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.174
Huh.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.216
Lesions in his bones.

14:07.217 --> 14:10.219
I'll bet his heart is
as black as his lungs.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.022
Carcinoma, widely metastatic
through the skeleton.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.384
Cancer could explain
that rib fracture.

14:15.385 --> 14:18.058
Yeah, maybe. But
so could bud Morris.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.931
(Megan) The consult is over,

14:21.932 --> 14:24.233
but your scrubs tell
me you're here to stay.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.896
You need to find where
Jason hid Noah Parker.

14:26.897 --> 14:30.339
Cause of death can't be your priority.
I can help. One body, one pathologist.

14:30.340 --> 14:33.602
I'll assist, okay?

14:33.603 --> 14:37.376
I've had other missing
person cases before.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.509
Why this one?

14:41.211 --> 14:44.383
I was new here. It was my...

14:44.384 --> 14:46.355
It was my third autopsy...

14:46.356 --> 14:48.958
A battered mom whose
daughter had gone missing.

14:48.959 --> 14:52.461
Curtis and I worked on that
case for two weeks straight.

14:52.462 --> 14:55.264
They never found the girl?

14:55.265 --> 14:58.929
Oh, they found her. She
was my fourth autopsy.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.337
Oh. It looks like his
spleen might be ruptured.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.679
Could be trauma?
That's bad news for bud.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.042
You needed a lab?

15:13.043 --> 15:15.314
Yeah. Where are
you at on that material

15:15.315 --> 15:18.387
from Helen's fingernails? We
think it's a fungus. It has spores.

15:18.388 --> 15:21.090
Spores transfer.

15:21.091 --> 15:24.553
And Jason has got
scratches on his hands.

15:24.554 --> 15:27.096
You think she got
the spores from him?

15:27.097 --> 15:30.129
All I see are dirty fingers
with a few splinters.

15:30.130 --> 15:34.233
Did either of you smell the
fungus? Like we had a choice.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.005
It was like rotten oysters.

15:36.006 --> 15:38.367
Perfect. Turn off the lights.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.570
(Switch clicks)

15:43.213 --> 15:46.215
(Ethan) That is cool. (Curtis) Looks
like our kidnapper glows in the dark.

15:46.216 --> 15:48.417
(Kate) What is it?

15:48.418 --> 15:51.120
Fox fire. It's a
bioluminescent fungus.

15:51.121 --> 15:52.421
It grows on wood.

15:52.422 --> 15:55.484
If it comes from the place
where Noah's hidden,

15:55.485 --> 15:58.257
we're looking for a
place that's dark, damp...

15:58.258 --> 16:01.361
And deadly for a
boy with asthma.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.066
(Knocks on doorjamb)

16:08.638 --> 16:11.970
You look like hell.
Get some sleep.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.742
Are you any closer to Noah?

16:13.743 --> 16:15.474
You know... (File thuds)

16:15.475 --> 16:17.476
You should not
be in this building,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.478
let alone near this case.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.980
I found this... underneath
the seat of my car.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.652
It's gotta be Noah's.

16:23.653 --> 16:26.355
I must have missed it
when I patted Jason down.

16:26.356 --> 16:28.487
He probably stashed it
on his way into the station.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.289
It looks chewed on.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.590
Well, if that's the case,

16:31.591 --> 16:33.592
the maybe it's been
where Noah's been,

16:33.593 --> 16:35.294
maybe there's a trace.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.595
(Bag crinkles)

16:36.596 --> 16:38.597
I'll let Megan know.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.400
(Bag thuds)

16:43.533 --> 16:46.505
Was it really necessary...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.138
Locking the door
and pulling the cable?

16:49.139 --> 16:51.440
Come on. We don't even
tape those interrogations.

16:51.441 --> 16:54.443
You know those cameras
aren't on. Those were tactics.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.445
Tactics?

16:56.446 --> 16:59.388
You know, Megan
found bruises on his neck,

16:59.389 --> 17:01.290
internal bleeding,

17:01.291 --> 17:04.153
and a ruptured spleen.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.155
I have been your best defense,

17:06.156 --> 17:09.229
but I am now running
on empty, okay?

17:15.405 --> 17:17.637
You should go.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.580
Why do I ever call you?

17:31.581 --> 17:34.283
(Chuckles) Or maybe
because I love you

17:34.284 --> 17:37.156
and I just want to
make sure you're okay?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.158
Are you doing your homework?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.429
Uh-huh.

17:40.430 --> 17:43.432
Did you ask your father?

17:43.433 --> 17:47.096
Okay, well, just make
sure you bring your phone.

17:47.097 --> 17:50.239
(Chuckles) I love you.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.701
(Sniffles and sighs)

17:52.702 --> 17:55.474
Oh, I know that look.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.677
Lacey's fine.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.709
How was dinner? It was terrific.

18:00.710 --> 18:04.183
Hmm. I just came by to see
how your case is coming along.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.754
Terrific.

18:05.755 --> 18:08.757
The one man who knows
where the boy is, is dead,

18:08.758 --> 18:10.759
our a detective
might have killed him,

18:10.760 --> 18:14.293
and the only lead I have
in the case is wood fungus.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.295
Well, I thought this might help.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.866
It's every case I could find

18:17.867 --> 18:19.868
in which Jason
Peterson is mentioned.

18:19.869 --> 18:23.503
Those are the abstracts.
I'm sending the files over.

18:25.335 --> 18:27.876
And the quid pro quo is?

18:27.877 --> 18:30.409
I'm here to help, Megan,

18:30.410 --> 18:35.545
and to find out what I said
that was so terribly wrong.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.729
(Opens drawer)

18:50.730 --> 18:52.562
(Rustles paper)

18:54.904 --> 18:58.708
You know how hard it is for
me to see that everywhere?

19:01.171 --> 19:03.572
That was the
worst day of my life.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.544
And every time
you run for office,

19:05.545 --> 19:07.646
I have to relive it.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.720
So that's what that
picture means to you?

19:12.652 --> 19:16.385
I always found it a
point of family pride...

19:16.386 --> 19:18.657
For becoming successful...

19:18.658 --> 19:20.529
For staying strong.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.532
Daddy killed himself, we
suffered, and I miss him.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.666
How is that a point
of family pride?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.271
If there's anything
else I can do

19:32.272 --> 19:34.503
to help you find that boy...

19:34.504 --> 19:36.505
Honestly,

19:36.506 --> 19:38.407
if it weren't a campaign year...

19:38.408 --> 19:40.609
No, I don't want
anything in return.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.251
Wish I could believe that.

19:42.252 --> 19:44.254
(Pamphlet clatters)

19:53.523 --> 19:55.894
Dr. Hunt, you called?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.596
Oh, hi. Yeah.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.598
Um, we found blood in the saliva

19:59.599 --> 20:00.899
on Noah's toy.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.602
And that could mean
anything. It just doesn't feel right.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.604
My team is running
labs on the blood,

20:05.605 --> 20:07.606
but I want to talk
to Noah's parents.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.240
Is that the best use of your
time? If his health is at issue, yes.

20:11.241 --> 20:13.242
But you haven't even
found the cause of death

20:13.243 --> 20:14.713
for Jason Peterson yet.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.616
I'm trying to prevent
Noah's. (Clicks button)

20:17.617 --> 20:20.249
You coming or not?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.750
(Elevator bell dings)

20:21.751 --> 20:24.593
You not goin' with her?

20:24.594 --> 20:26.655
(Scoffs)

20:26.656 --> 20:28.557
I guess not.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.529
(Folder thuds)

20:30.530 --> 20:32.801
(High-pitched voice) Hmm.

20:32.802 --> 20:35.804
(Police radio chatter)

20:35.805 --> 20:38.808
(Siren wailing)

20:41.441 --> 20:45.345
(Bubbling)

20:49.779 --> 20:55.284
I believe this belongs to Noah.

20:55.285 --> 21:00.389
We found that after Jason
Peterson was arrested.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.391
I need to ask you some questions

21:02.392 --> 21:04.393
about Noah's health. (Sniffles)

21:04.394 --> 21:07.666
Did he have an
asthma attack recently?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.338
My son is gone,

21:09.339 --> 21:11.600
and you're asking
me about asthma

21:11.601 --> 21:14.603
when your people killed
the man who took him?

21:14.604 --> 21:18.707
You have every
right to be angry.

21:18.708 --> 21:21.710
But your son is still out there,

21:21.711 --> 21:24.283
and he needs your help.

21:29.058 --> 21:32.791
(Voice breaks) I'm sorry.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.664
(Sniffles)

21:39.729 --> 21:42.931
Everything's been so hard.

21:42.932 --> 21:45.634
Tom's business
has been struggling.

21:45.635 --> 21:47.676
My family won't give
him another loan.

21:47.677 --> 21:50.379
We've spent so
much time fighting...

21:50.380 --> 21:54.483
(Sniffles) Neither of us
have been there for Noah.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.014
(Crying) God.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.447
I just want my son back.

21:58.448 --> 21:59.988
(Woman) We're getting an image.

21:59.989 --> 22:02.090
(Gasps)

22:02.091 --> 22:04.453
(Computer beeps)

22:04.454 --> 22:06.725
Oh, my god.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.798
(Jennifer) Oh, my god. Noah.

22:09.799 --> 22:13.502
We've got our motive.

22:13.503 --> 22:15.333
(Crying)

22:15.334 --> 22:17.806
We have more than
that. Look at the picture.

22:17.807 --> 22:20.338
He's sick,

22:20.339 --> 22:23.112
and a lot worse than I thought.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.751
(Elevator bell dings)

22:32.752 --> 22:34.653
(Megan) Sweaty hair means fever,

22:34.654 --> 22:36.124
sunken eyes... dehydration,

22:36.125 --> 22:37.786
and blue mouth...
Oxygen deprivation.

22:37.787 --> 22:40.629
Hmm. Or it could
mean he's in a hot room,

22:40.630 --> 22:43.131
he's not getting water,
and he has asthma.

22:43.132 --> 22:44.793
If he's coughing up blood,

22:44.794 --> 22:46.795
he's got a fever, and a bad one.

22:46.796 --> 22:49.638
Well, on a positive note...

22:49.639 --> 22:51.640
(Scoffs) Can't
wait to hear this.

22:51.641 --> 22:53.402
He's alive, he's not alone,

22:53.403 --> 22:55.404
and this tells us who
we're dealing with.

22:55.405 --> 22:57.476
Hastily constructed,
no visual time stamp,

22:57.477 --> 22:59.708
like a newspaper
or TV, no mention

22:59.709 --> 23:01.710
of a future phone call
or exchange plan...

23:01.711 --> 23:04.653
Now that is not the
work of slick extortionist.

23:04.654 --> 23:07.856
So whoever has Noah is
incompetent and desperate.

23:07.857 --> 23:10.489
Hmm. How is that a good thing?

23:10.490 --> 23:11.760
(Chuckles)

23:11.761 --> 23:14.062
Because Jason may not
have known the Parkers,

23:14.063 --> 23:15.824
but his accomplice does.

23:15.825 --> 23:18.066
The problem is, Jason's
contact list is huge.

23:18.067 --> 23:20.068
Now we're running all the leads,

23:20.069 --> 23:22.802
but we could use some
evidence from the body.

23:24.904 --> 23:29.678
I'll have something
for you in an hour.

23:29.679 --> 23:32.842
(Scoffs) I promise.

23:34.884 --> 23:37.746
You promised him evidence?

23:37.747 --> 23:39.417
I got carried away.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.419
(Sighs) You
wouldn't be the first

23:41.420 --> 23:45.093
to get carried away
by Derek ames.

23:45.094 --> 23:49.427
May I remind you that you
already have a boyfriend?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.829
Huh.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.662
What is it?

23:55.735 --> 23:58.667
It looks like Jason swallowed
some kind of an insect.

23:58.668 --> 24:01.770
Maybe we can get Curtis to
find out where it came from.

24:01.771 --> 24:03.642
Well, his carotids look fine,

24:03.643 --> 24:06.715
but the bruises go
deep into Jason's neck.

24:06.716 --> 24:10.819
Bud could lose his entire
career over one mistake.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.151
If we don't find Noah,

24:13.152 --> 24:16.786
bud is gonna have to live
with a lot worse than that.

24:23.933 --> 24:25.864
What are you doing here?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.866
Nobody else is talking to me.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.539
(Sighs) How's it comin'?

24:30.540 --> 24:32.000
Finding an accomplice

24:32.001 --> 24:35.504
is like finding a
needle in a haystack.

24:35.505 --> 24:39.207
Bud, you'd better
prepare for the worst.

24:39.208 --> 24:42.150
Every sign on Jason's
body points to trauma.

24:42.151 --> 24:46.255
I.a.'s already talking about
voluntary manslaughter.

24:49.659 --> 24:50.720
(Grunts)

24:58.267 --> 25:01.701
What the hell happened in there?

25:03.903 --> 25:06.775
Does it really matter?

25:06.776 --> 25:10.108
I lost that boy.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.712
On my watch, I lost that boy.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.987
I could come back.

25:18.988 --> 25:21.990
(Peter) Not if it's
the Parker case.

25:21.991 --> 25:23.822
What did you find?

25:23.823 --> 25:27.155
A trace on Jason's
teeth. Uh, cocaine.

25:27.156 --> 25:30.599
Nice stuff, too. Cut
with talc and synephrine.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.931
Synephrine? Not a
lot of dealers in Philly

25:32.932 --> 25:35.133
cut their cocaine with
a weight-loss drug.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.567
I can count 'em on one hand.

25:39.809 --> 25:42.811
Do you recognize
any of the names here?

25:42.812 --> 25:45.645
Megan's mother gave them to us.

25:48.678 --> 25:52.120
(Man) Don't know
him. (Ames) Strange.

25:52.121 --> 25:53.852
Because in Jason's body,

25:53.853 --> 25:56.855
we found the exact same
blend of cocaine you sell.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.887
I don't know him.

25:58.888 --> 26:01.960
You both... Ran
stolen auto parts

26:01.961 --> 26:04.963
to the exact same dealers...

26:04.964 --> 26:06.795
(Thuds) For years.

26:06.796 --> 26:09.237
Should I say it
again? That's a shame.

26:09.238 --> 26:10.769
Because...

26:10.770 --> 26:12.771
I've got a lot of
people telling me

26:12.772 --> 26:14.773
you both hatched this plan

26:14.774 --> 26:17.606
to steal a little boy for money.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.649
Now the boy's missing.

26:21.110 --> 26:24.112
Now I'd love to know,
was that Jason's idea...

26:24.113 --> 26:27.215
Or yours? Look, I had
nothing to do with that, man.

26:27.216 --> 26:29.718
All right. I don't
mess with kids.

26:29.719 --> 26:31.720
Then you tell me
everything you don't know

26:31.721 --> 26:33.021
about Jason Peterson.

26:33.022 --> 26:34.723
(Blows air)

26:34.724 --> 26:36.765
Come on.

26:36.766 --> 26:39.067
He come by about two weeks ago,

26:39.068 --> 26:41.730
looking for some junk.

26:41.731 --> 26:43.832
Said he had a toothache.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.635
We, uh...

26:46.636 --> 26:48.937
Run some parts
together in the past,

26:48.938 --> 26:51.940
but I hadn't seen this
guy in over a year, man.

26:51.941 --> 26:56.645
Running auto parts
means hiding places, right?

26:56.646 --> 26:59.818
I want a full list.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.091
Now.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.025
He's got hiding
places all over the city.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.128
What else was Jason
dealing? I don't know.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.831
But it's gonna take the
police all day to check 'em.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.833
Well, Noah might
not have that long.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.134
Try the river.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.137
The bug the kidnapper
inhaled is a young caddis fly.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.339
They need open
freshwater to breathe.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.242
So three places
along the Delaware.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.745
Noah got sick fast,

27:26.746 --> 27:29.347
so we're looking
for poor air quality.

27:29.348 --> 27:33.051
That looks like a rail
yard. Let's start there.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.053
Call Derek, will you?

27:35.054 --> 27:37.757
Tell him I'll meet
him at the station.

27:40.059 --> 27:44.162
(Man) Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! (Man) Clear!

27:44.163 --> 27:46.164
(Man) Clear here.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.167
(Helicopter blades whirring)

27:49.168 --> 27:53.441
(Police radio chatter)

27:53.442 --> 27:55.103
Got a police scanner.

27:55.104 --> 27:59.147
If they were here, they
knew we were coming.

27:59.148 --> 28:01.149
There's no wood here.

28:01.150 --> 28:04.853
There's no place for that
fungus on Jason's body to grow.

28:04.854 --> 28:06.885
(Equipment clatters)

28:06.886 --> 28:09.287
Maybe this is not
their only hideout.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.019
(Siren wailing)

28:11.020 --> 28:12.460
Ames.

28:12.461 --> 28:15.363
(Wailing continues)

28:15.364 --> 28:17.195
He was here.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.968
They must have just left.

28:19.969 --> 28:21.429
Blood.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.431
(Radio chatter continues)

28:23.432 --> 28:26.435
(People speaking indistinctly)

28:33.442 --> 28:35.985
Noah's got pneumonia.

28:37.346 --> 28:39.017
Could be a cut.

28:39.018 --> 28:42.290
Look at the spray pattern.

28:42.291 --> 28:44.994
He's coughing up blood.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.864
No new calls. No
idea where the boy is.

28:55.865 --> 28:57.866
Please tell me you
found something.

28:57.867 --> 29:00.208
I'm working on it. Work faster.

29:00.209 --> 29:02.510
The problem is, I don't
know which of these bruises

29:02.511 --> 29:04.512
are from the kidnapping,
bud's interrogation,

29:04.513 --> 29:06.875
or just being Jason Peterson.

29:06.876 --> 29:09.778
(Kate) Well, hopefully,
something on his body

29:09.779 --> 29:12.782
will give us a lead
to where that boy is.

29:14.223 --> 29:16.224
There's no cancer
in his jaw, is there?

29:16.225 --> 29:17.886
No.

29:17.887 --> 29:19.527
The mandible looks clean. Why?

29:19.528 --> 29:21.389
Kevin the drug dealer

29:21.390 --> 29:23.391
said he needed
something for a toothache.

29:23.392 --> 29:26.134
So if there's no cancer there...

29:26.135 --> 29:28.067
Then why the toothache?

29:34.543 --> 29:36.544
Those aren't tobacco stains.

29:36.545 --> 29:39.007
The gums are rotting.

29:39.008 --> 29:41.009
It looks like an
advanced infection,

29:41.010 --> 29:44.313
but that tissue's too far
gone to take a culture.

29:46.355 --> 29:48.316
Maybe we don't need to.

29:48.317 --> 29:50.819
I had assumed that these bruises

29:50.820 --> 29:52.821
were lumps from
bud's interrogation.

29:52.822 --> 29:56.395
But... maybe...

29:59.428 --> 30:01.871
It might be...

30:05.434 --> 30:07.435
Sulfur granules.

30:07.436 --> 30:09.037
Actinomycosis.

30:09.038 --> 30:10.839
Okay. (Exhales deeply)

30:10.840 --> 30:14.813
Let's start with the arteries around
the spleen. (Instruments clatter)

30:20.289 --> 30:21.990
You wanted to see me?

30:21.991 --> 30:23.923
Sit down.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.333
Might as well read that.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.066
It's yours.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.839
(Sighs) Can I just
hear it from you?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.372
An infection
started in his teeth

30:44.373 --> 30:46.214
that moved into his blood,

30:46.215 --> 30:49.879
and finally, one of
his arteries burst.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.025
So...

30:57.026 --> 30:59.057
I didn't cause it?

30:59.058 --> 31:03.861
Jason Peterson died of
a burst mycotic aneurysm,

31:03.862 --> 31:07.035
which had been slowly dissecting

31:07.036 --> 31:10.268
long before he
came to the station.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.241
You didn't do it.

31:13.242 --> 31:15.503
(Exhales deeply)

31:15.504 --> 31:20.879
(Blows air)

31:22.982 --> 31:24.413
Bud...

31:29.959 --> 31:31.961
Did you think you killed him?

31:35.524 --> 31:38.296
(Sighs)

31:38.297 --> 31:43.031
I've replayed that 20
minutes over and over again.

31:43.032 --> 31:47.235
Everything I'd done before...

31:47.236 --> 31:51.179
But this time, I...

31:51.180 --> 31:54.943
I wanted that confession.

31:54.944 --> 31:57.646
I wanted to save that kid.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.690
I lost control.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.695
I understand.

32:08.357 --> 32:13.002
It's a horrible thing to know
that you've killed someone.

32:14.964 --> 32:16.065
Megan.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.670
Thank you.

32:22.671 --> 32:24.372
(Knock on door)

32:24.373 --> 32:26.144
I'm sorry to interrupt again,

32:26.145 --> 32:28.476
but... but we
identified the infection

32:28.477 --> 32:30.548
that burst Jason's arteries.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.050
Actinomyces...

32:32.051 --> 32:35.584
Well-known cause
of vaporizer lung.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.492
Apparently, Tom Parker's
business went bankrupt

32:44.493 --> 32:46.494
last year.

32:46.495 --> 32:50.068
Maybe he needs the
ransom to bail him out.

32:50.069 --> 32:53.041
So he kidnaps his own kid?

32:53.042 --> 32:54.672
Maybe. Desperate man.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.575
What's going on?
What did you find?

32:57.576 --> 33:00.378
Bacteria in your
son's vaporizer.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.381
It gets airborne, and
then infects the lungs.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.983
I replace that
water all the time.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.985
Not the filter.
Most people don't.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.089
That's where bacteria can
thrive. How is any of this relevant?

33:11.090 --> 33:13.091
This is what killed
Jason Peterson.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.194
Cancer had already
compromised his immune system,

33:16.195 --> 33:18.066
so he was susceptible.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.068
Is that what Noah has, too?

33:20.069 --> 33:23.401
It could be. He has
severe pneumonia.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.174
How is any of this
gonna get Noah back?

33:26.175 --> 33:30.007
Because now we know
Jason was in this room.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.080
How is that possible?

33:32.081 --> 33:34.042
My guess...

33:34.043 --> 33:36.515
Is with the help
of an accomplice.

33:38.047 --> 33:39.187
Who?

33:39.188 --> 33:42.751
I was hoping you'd
tell us, Mr. Parker.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.765
(Morris) An inside job would
make you the ideal inside man.

33:57.766 --> 34:00.238
Why would I kidnap my own son?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.709
Your business...

34:01.710 --> 34:04.542
Had already gone belly-up.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.544
Your marriage was
ending. You had nothing left.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.546
You needed a way to cash out.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.249
Is this what you've
been working on?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.621
(Chuckles) Is this
your best theory?

34:13.622 --> 34:16.354
Family abductions
happen all the time.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.526
(Morris) All you
needed was a ruse

34:18.527 --> 34:21.829
and a hired hand to carry it out, grab
Noah. I want my son back more than anything.

34:21.830 --> 34:23.831
But things started to
go south, didn't they?

34:23.832 --> 34:25.833
Helen fought and
died, Jason got arrested,

34:25.834 --> 34:27.535
and then...

34:27.536 --> 34:30.098
And then you had nothing
left, you didn't know what to do.

34:30.099 --> 34:33.171
I love Noah. I loved
Helen like family.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.604
Why would I ever put either of them in
harm's way? Come on. You were desperate.

34:36.605 --> 34:38.606
Now who else had
access to that room?

34:38.607 --> 34:41.179
I've already told you
everything! No, you haven't!

34:41.180 --> 34:44.182
You haven't told us
anything! I can't think! Please!

34:44.183 --> 34:46.785
(Sighs)

34:52.221 --> 34:54.592
Mr. Parker...

34:54.593 --> 34:58.226
Your son Noah is at risk...

34:58.227 --> 35:00.298
Partly because of me.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.870
Now if you didn't do this,

35:02.871 --> 35:06.705
you have to help us right now.

35:13.742 --> 35:16.184
W-Wait.

35:16.185 --> 35:18.486
Six weeks ago...

35:18.487 --> 35:21.589
I took Jen to cape may
for the long weekend.

35:21.590 --> 35:23.751
It was a romantic getaway.

35:23.752 --> 35:26.254
I was trying to fix
things between us.

35:26.255 --> 35:29.697
And you left Noah
alone with Helen.

35:29.698 --> 35:32.361
For two days.

35:36.805 --> 35:38.506
That's out. (Slams down folder)

35:38.507 --> 35:40.168
So who did Helen trust

35:40.169 --> 35:42.170
that would let Jason
into the Parker house?

35:42.171 --> 35:45.173
I spoke with her boyfriend
Oscar, and it wasn't him.

35:45.174 --> 35:47.245
A fight put him in
county general hospital

35:47.246 --> 35:49.247
the weekend the
Parkers were out of town.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.749
And get this... Helen was
with him the whole time.

35:51.750 --> 35:55.253
Then who took care of the boy?
Who did Helen trust the most?

35:55.254 --> 35:57.655
One of the nannies.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.327
Great minds.

35:59.328 --> 36:02.760
If Jason was exposed
to a fungus at a hideout,

36:02.761 --> 36:06.434
then presumably, his
accomplice was as well.

36:06.435 --> 36:09.797
And the nannies handled
their own witness statements.

36:09.798 --> 36:11.869
So?

36:11.870 --> 36:13.401
So...

36:13.402 --> 36:15.403
(Morris) What are those marks?

36:15.404 --> 36:19.807
(Megan) Fungus... the same
kind we found on Jason Peterson.

36:19.808 --> 36:21.679
Gentlemen, I give you

36:21.680 --> 36:24.252
rena Talbot,

36:24.253 --> 36:25.883
our second kidnapper.

36:25.884 --> 36:29.257
(Exhales)

36:29.258 --> 36:31.789
She lied right to my face.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.592
So she gave us Oscar
just to throw us off.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.894
The good news is, the
family that rena works for

36:36.895 --> 36:39.827
is out of town and has been for
a week. What's the bad news?

36:39.828 --> 36:42.530
She works for the shaws. As
in Madeline Shaw, the heiress?

36:42.531 --> 36:45.533
Why is that bad news? The last time
I tried to get a warrant for that family,

36:45.534 --> 36:48.506
it was for a second
cousin, and I went 0-for-4.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.778
So are we gonna get
one on a Sunday morning?

36:50.779 --> 36:52.440
(Sighs)

36:52.441 --> 36:55.212
Okay, I'm curious. How'd
you get the warrant?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.884
I know someone.

36:56.885 --> 36:58.546
Now I'm more curious.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.818
Where's the boy?
Where's Noah Parker?

37:00.819 --> 37:03.851
I have no idea what you're talking
about. You're lying to me. Take her inside.

37:03.852 --> 37:05.723
We'll go room by room.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.726
(Officers speaking indistinctly)

37:08.727 --> 37:12.330
(Siren wails)

37:12.331 --> 37:15.333
(Police radio chatter)

37:15.334 --> 37:18.337
(Officers continue
speaking indistinctly)

37:22.341 --> 37:25.813
(Badly drawn boy's "what
tomorrow brings" playing)

37:25.814 --> 37:28.746
Dark and damp.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.748
He's down here!

37:30.749 --> 37:32.750

(Man shouts indistinctly)

38:27.976 --> 38:32.480
Shut down the streets.
They're ready to go.

38:32.481 --> 38:34.842
Hey. Wait a minute.

38:34.843 --> 38:37.945
I had no idea the boy was down
there. Oh, really? That's strange,

38:37.946 --> 38:40.017
'cause you're the
one who put him there.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.520
Your boyfriend Jason...
You remember him?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.692
He was in debt,
needed cash quick.

38:44.693 --> 38:46.694
But you know what you forgot?

38:46.695 --> 38:48.055
Helen.

38:48.056 --> 38:51.799
Shefoughtfor that boy.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.833
She gave her life
trying to save him.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.406
You remember that.

38:58.407 --> 39:00.938
Get her out of here.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.471
(Car door opens)

39:03.472 --> 39:06.475
(Officers speaking indistinctly)

39:12.821 --> 39:15.052
Do you ever slow down?

39:15.053 --> 39:17.124
Do you?

39:17.125 --> 39:19.658
In the right company.

39:23.732 --> 39:25.963
(Sighs) Um, when
I'm not working,

39:25.964 --> 39:27.735
I'm with my daughter.

39:27.736 --> 39:29.597
And if she's not available?

39:29.598 --> 39:32.600
Well, I'm sure you have
a brilliant suggestion.

39:32.601 --> 39:34.071
After every case,

39:34.072 --> 39:36.944
I like to go for a long
ride on my motorcycle.

39:36.945 --> 39:38.776
That's not very smart.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.478
It's very relaxing.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.480
You do know that motorcyclists

39:42.481 --> 39:45.453
are the biggest organ
donors in the country?

39:45.454 --> 39:46.954
Yeah, sure,

39:46.955 --> 39:48.956
which is why having
a drink with you

39:48.957 --> 39:50.958
is a much safer
alternative, don't you think?

39:50.959 --> 39:53.060
(Laughs) That was
way too smooth.

39:53.061 --> 39:55.763
Or maybe I'll see
you on my bike.

39:55.764 --> 39:59.096
Uh, not before I
see you on my table.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.728
Hmm.

40:00.729 --> 40:03.031
Call me if you change your mind.

40:07.035 --> 40:09.477
(Engine turns over)

40:09.478 --> 40:12.410
(Second engine turns over)

40:28.857 --> 40:31.028
(Knock on door)

40:31.029 --> 40:34.001
I see the Parker boy
is back with his family.

40:34.002 --> 40:35.733
Oh.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.937
Thanks to Helen Martin.

40:43.912 --> 40:46.644
Something tells me
you will be presiding

40:46.645 --> 40:48.776
over rena Talbot's trial.

40:48.777 --> 40:51.779
Oh, actually, the cases
are assigned by lottery,

40:51.780 --> 40:54.683
but my publicist
would love it. Mm-hmm.

40:58.186 --> 41:01.659
What's this?

41:01.660 --> 41:05.033
The scariest four
hours of my life.

41:07.736 --> 41:09.937
The day your
father killed himself,

41:09.938 --> 41:13.501
I came back to a house
filled with cops and you gone.

41:13.502 --> 41:16.103
Ran away, they said.

41:16.104 --> 41:18.105
For the next four
hours, I was frantic.

41:18.106 --> 41:22.050
I thought that maybe I had
lost both you and your father.

41:23.612 --> 41:25.613
But they found you.

41:25.614 --> 41:28.617
You were sound asleep
in your father's toolshed.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.620
I didn't know where you were.

41:32.621 --> 41:34.962
Is that why you've been helping,

41:34.963 --> 41:38.996
because you... lost
a child for four hours?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.698
Megan...

41:40.699 --> 41:44.072
I lost you for the
next 30 years.

41:48.937 --> 41:51.178
So why did you help?

41:51.179 --> 41:53.180
Well, I wanted them
to find the Parker boy,

41:53.181 --> 41:56.183
but I wanted you to find him
more than that because I...

41:56.184 --> 41:59.046
I knew how much it meant to you.

41:59.047 --> 42:02.249
I miss you, Megan.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.952
I spend a lot of my time

42:04.953 --> 42:07.525
wondering how I
can get you back.

42:14.062 --> 42:16.904
You'll still be
campaigning for me, I hope.

42:16.905 --> 42:21.709
(Laughs)

42:21.710 --> 42:25.142
You do not give up, do you?

42:25.143 --> 42:26.644
I...

42:26.645 --> 42:31.920
(Laughs) Oh, my god. (Laughs)
