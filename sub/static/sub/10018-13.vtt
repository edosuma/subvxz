00:06.833 --> 00:08.308
Previously on E.R.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.690
I have never seen such a chain
of errors on judgement.

00:10.691 --> 00:11.791
But I did what you said.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.986
In a case where the injuries
were inflamatory like,

00:14.087 --> 00:15.771
leaving a newborn motherless...

00:16.588 --> 00:17.631
Mr O'Brian.

00:17.632 --> 00:19.178
He's Carl's newly anointed.

00:19.179 --> 00:20.767
The heir apparent.

00:21.430 --> 00:23.613
It's been the best and hardest work
I've ever done.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.534
Good. That's music to my ears.

00:26.535 --> 00:28.340
You're a candidate
for chief resident next year.

00:28.341 --> 00:30.253
But is just that now
is not a very good time.

00:30.254 --> 00:31.627
There is never a good time.

00:31.728 --> 00:36.636
The truth is mommy and daddy
aren't gonna live together anymore.

01:23.473 --> 01:26.809
- I love it when those endorphins kick in.
- You're not on today, are you?

01:26.979 --> 01:30.896
I thought I'd drop by,
ease up your workload a little bit.

01:31.069 --> 01:33.561
After I take a shower.

01:34.825 --> 01:36.534
- It's his day off?
- That's dedication.

01:36.703 --> 01:39.659
Dedication? Man, that's sad.

01:39.958 --> 01:43.376
Don't move, Mrs. Zarian.

01:43.548 --> 01:47.382
It's a little bit of glass,
and it's almost free.

01:47.554 --> 01:50.510
Susan, were your ears burning?

01:50.684 --> 01:53.521
David Morgenstern and I
were just talking about you.

01:53.689 --> 01:56.608
He feels you're the top contender
for Chief Resident next year.

01:57.278 --> 01:58.442
Oh, thanks.

01:58.614 --> 02:00.738
This year's field
was pretty disappointing...

02:00.909 --> 02:03.616
...but we found your work
to be consistently solid.

02:03.789 --> 02:07.326
Now, I know you're concerned about
taking time away from the baby...

02:07.503 --> 02:09.663
...but that doesn't have
to be the case.

02:09.841 --> 02:12.048
Keep the bevel facing out.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.260
By applying
time-management techniques...

02:14.431 --> 02:16.092
...you can work more efficiently...

02:16.268 --> 02:19.224
...reduce on-the-job stress
and get home at a reasonable hour.

02:20.024 --> 02:21.056
Mrs. Zarian...

02:21.234 --> 02:24.237
I've got a book on the subject,
if you're interested. No pressure.

02:24.406 --> 02:26.815
I just wanna let you know
how we're thinking.

02:30.291 --> 02:31.454
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

02:31.626 --> 02:33.454
They cut me back
to three shifts a week.

02:33.629 --> 02:36.039
- They're cutting back on nurses?
- Nurse managers...

02:36.217 --> 02:37.962
...because of our outrageous salaries.

02:38.137 --> 02:40.546
I still need $12,000 worth of work
on my house!

02:40.724 --> 02:43.893
They bumped me up to six shifts a week.
So much for my weekend.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.556
- I know a way to make some quick cash.
- Talk to me.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.355
I joined this guy Alvin's investment club.
Put up a $2000 membership fee...

02:50.532 --> 02:53.950
...and in a week to 10 days,
you collect 10 to $20,000.

02:54.121 --> 02:56.910
- From?
- The fees of the new people who join.

02:57.084 --> 03:00.787
- It's called a pyramid scam, it's illegal.
- Well, that's not what Alvin says.

03:00.966 --> 03:03.458
Trust me, if you're not in early,
you lose your shirt.

03:03.637 --> 03:05.215
When did you get in?

03:09.688 --> 03:12.181
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.315
All right, let's see what we got here.

03:16.992 --> 03:19.864
- Where'd you learn to do sub-q sutures?
- From your med student.

03:20.039 --> 03:23.742
- I obviously taught him well, didn't I?
- Benton.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.914
- See you later.
- Listen, I should warn you:

03:26.090 --> 03:28.761
You might want to invest in a new suit
and some luggage.

03:28.928 --> 03:32.631
You're going to Paris to present
our clamp-and-run study to the institute.

03:32.810 --> 03:36.263
- Are you serious?
- Oui. Simon did an analysis of our result.

03:36.441 --> 03:37.686
Our P-value was. 06.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.566
We're one successful outcome away
from statistical significance.

03:40.739 --> 03:42.318
- We can publish?
- Soon.

03:42.492 --> 03:46.539
One more aneurysm and our numbers
will blind the most dubious skeptics.

03:46.707 --> 03:49.876
After that, we head to D.C.
to play dog-and-pony for the FDA.

03:50.046 --> 03:52.005
Now, Simon doesn't fly,
so he stays here...

03:52.175 --> 03:55.546
...which makes you the next choice for
Clamp-and-Run Ambassador to Europe.

03:55.722 --> 03:57.550
I don't know what to say. I'm honored.

03:57.725 --> 04:01.227
It's good practice for the future.
You've gotta find another patient soon...

04:01.398 --> 04:03.807
...because the Norwegians
are doing a similar study.

04:03.986 --> 04:07.855
And, Peter, we cannot let the Vikings
pillage our thunder.

04:11.748 --> 04:14.419
- Malik, you seen Carter?
- He called and said he'd be late.

04:14.586 --> 04:16.414
He should be coming any minute.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.381
No, wait! Wait! Wait!

04:24.018 --> 04:27.520
Yeah! Oh, God! John! Oh, God!

04:27.691 --> 04:30.148
Oh, God!

04:35.746 --> 04:37.954
Oh, baby.

04:40.504 --> 04:42.961
I think we broke my record.

04:43.801 --> 04:45.344
Yeah.

04:45.512 --> 04:48.135
- Oh, John.
- What?

04:48.308 --> 04:51.477
Your control is phenomenal.

04:51.647 --> 04:52.846
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:53.024 --> 04:56.193
Yeah. Thank you.

04:59.910 --> 05:04.540
You know, you may find this hard to
believe, but that wasn't always the case.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.953
- No?
- It's hard to believe, it's true though.

05:07.131 --> 05:10.881
But I found if I could distract myself
and think about mundane things...

05:11.054 --> 05:13.344
...then I could delay the inevitable.

05:14.810 --> 05:18.513
Well, what kind of things
do you think about?

05:20.778 --> 05:26.286
Let's see. Sometimes I take a mental
inventory of the machines in the O.R.

05:26.454 --> 05:28.946
Thora-Seal, ventilators, auto-infusers.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.745
And then, as the degree of difficulty
increases, I run the procedures.

05:32.923 --> 05:36.709
Appendectomies, thyroidectomies,
bowel resections.

05:36.888 --> 05:39.214
- Yuck!
- What?

05:40.727 --> 05:44.264
While we're making love,
you're thinking about bowel resections.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.067
Given your earlier testimonial...

05:46.236 --> 05:48.859
...this is a case of the ends
justifying the means.

05:49.032 --> 05:51.442
- What? Get out!
- I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.

06:42.578 --> 06:46.115
So last night I get a letter from
Jen's lawyer politely informing me...

06:46.293 --> 06:48.702
...that she's suing me
for full custody of Rachel.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.541
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, it seems I've been...

06:50.717 --> 06:52.128
...a distant and absent father.

06:52.303 --> 06:55.305
This after commuting from Milwaukee
for half a year.

06:55.474 --> 06:57.932
Well, it sounds like a lot of lawyer B.S.

06:58.104 --> 07:00.347
I can't imagine she'd actually
go through with it.

07:00.524 --> 07:04.655
- I was climbing the walls all night.
- Well, that's why you're here.

07:04.823 --> 07:08.075
- Tiny prick.
- I beg your pardon?

07:09.664 --> 07:11.492
I need a TB test too.

07:13.713 --> 07:17.000
So I hear Morgenstern has really
turned up the pressure...

07:17.177 --> 07:19.586
...on you becoming Chief Resident.

07:19.764 --> 07:23.052
Yeah, it's a good opportunity,
but can I do it and not work killer hours?

07:23.228 --> 07:27.727
You know how well I managed
to balance work and family.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.895
- Guess that answers that.
- You'll be able to work it out.

07:31.074 --> 07:34.410
Take your paperwork home,
hours won't be that bad.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.417
- You have to cut Weaver some slack.
- What do you mean?

07:37.585 --> 07:40.374
You go out of your way to avoid her.

07:40.548 --> 07:42.875
And if she's gonna be training you...

07:43.052 --> 07:45.379
...you're gonna have to work together
hand in hand.

07:45.556 --> 07:47.052
Oh, there's an image.

07:47.226 --> 07:51.273
- Why are you here on your day off?
- I went for a jog and ended up here.

07:51.441 --> 07:55.607
- Figured I might as well save some lives.
- One other good reason not to exercise.

07:55.781 --> 07:59.568
32-year-old male, postictal,
five-minute grand mal seizure.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.583
I'll take it. Start a chart.

08:02.751 --> 08:04.745
On his day off?

08:06.215 --> 08:08.624
- The orders should've been in already.
- I forgot.

08:08.803 --> 08:10.678
- I thought you wanted a Residency.
- I do.

08:10.848 --> 08:13.970
Keep forgetting, you'll be in North
Dakota. We got 300 applications.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.684
- When do the interviews start?
- They already have.

08:16.858 --> 08:18.982
Vucelich needs one more aneurysm
for his study.

08:19.153 --> 08:23.367
Abdominal pains, chest pains,
traumas, call me.

08:23.535 --> 08:25.660
How often do you get dizzy spells,
Mrs. Henry?

08:25.831 --> 08:29.118
Oh, I get three or four a day.
Usually when I'm working in the shed.

08:29.295 --> 08:32.914
- You garden this time of year?
- I'm a vermiculturist.

08:33.092 --> 08:35.217
- I raise earthworms.
- Really?

08:35.388 --> 08:38.140
Big ones from Belgium.
Finest castings in the world.

08:38.308 --> 08:43.058
- And by castings you mean?
- Worm dung. Black gold.

08:43.234 --> 08:47.068
It's the best fertilizer money can buy.
It fixes the nitrogen in the soil.

08:47.241 --> 08:50.078
- And you sell the stuff?
- I sell the worms.

08:51.372 --> 08:54.161
Your blood pressure's a little high.

08:54.336 --> 08:57.837
- So it pays well?
- Six figures.

09:00.846 --> 09:02.175
Has he had a seizure before?

09:02.349 --> 09:04.758
No, he's a health nut.
He runs every day.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.516
We're gonna have to get a CAT scan
of his head to pinpoint the cause.

09:08.901 --> 09:11.358
Alan. Alan?

09:11.739 --> 09:14.944
- When's he gonna come back?
- It takes a little time to recover.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.078
- Well, how long?
- Usually about 30 minutes.

09:17.248 --> 09:19.491
Multifocal PVCs.

09:20.378 --> 09:21.790
What?

09:22.173 --> 09:26.505
His heart rhythm's a little off. Probably
oxygen deprivation from the seizure.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.888
- Has he had a murmur before?
- No.

09:29.059 --> 09:30.852
Well, it's probably nothing serious.

09:31.021 --> 09:33.940
Let's get an echo of his heart
after the CT, just to be safe.

09:34.109 --> 09:37.694
Lidocaine bolus, 100 milligrams,
then start a drip.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.488
No, Carter. John Carter.

09:41.663 --> 09:44.334
I thought maybe you were trying
to get in touch with me...

09:44.501 --> 09:47.587
...to set up an interview
for the Residency.

09:47.756 --> 09:51.543
No, huh? Well, I'm available at any-

09:53.766 --> 09:56.603
Okay, great- Right.

09:56.771 --> 09:58.765
I hear Vucelich doubled his finder's fee...

09:58.941 --> 10:00.852
- ... for an aneurysm.
- Could be.

10:01.028 --> 10:03.188
I made 1000 bucks.

10:03.365 --> 10:06.570
Patient with a history of ulcers,
says the pain's different this time.

10:06.746 --> 10:08.953
- Rigid belly?
- Hard to tell. He's so fat.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.451
But see the calcifications
on the descending aorta?

10:11.629 --> 10:12.958
- No, where?
- Here.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.631
It's too lateral.
Probably just schmutz on his lungs.

10:16.804 --> 10:19.379
- I shouldn't call Vucelich?
- If you wanna get yelled at.

10:19.558 --> 10:21.802
Harper, I need you
to get this guy to CT.

10:21.979 --> 10:24.982
Coming.
Can you return this x-ray to his room?

10:25.151 --> 10:26.266
- Which room?
- Six.

10:26.445 --> 10:29.317
Hey, you done with that?
Wow, that's a mother of an aneurysm.

10:30.201 --> 10:34.201
- How can you tell?
- Calcification on the descending aorta.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.831
Yeah.

10:38.798 --> 10:40.341
Yeah.

10:41.177 --> 10:43.301
We're gonna run the CAT scan
on his head...

10:43.472 --> 10:45.965
...to rule out lesions
that could've caused the seizure.

10:46.143 --> 10:47.389
What's wrong?

10:47.562 --> 10:49.355
He's in V-tach.
Let's get him to Trauma.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.019
- Haleh?
- I'm here.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.484
- What's wrong with him?
- His heart rhythm's worse.

10:53.656 --> 10:56.825
You sure he hasn't taken medication?
Any non-prescription drugs?

10:56.995 --> 10:59.202
- No, never!
- We're gonna get this under control.

10:59.373 --> 11:01.664
Can someone take Mrs. Wimbur
to the waiting room?

11:01.836 --> 11:03.212
- But I just wanna-
- It's okay.

11:03.380 --> 11:07.332
- Another 50 of lidocaine, IV push.
- Heart's racing, 200.

11:07.512 --> 11:10.431
- Rhythm is all over the place.
- Looks like Torsade de Pointes.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.054
All right, Harper.
Let's get lytes and the tox screen.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.106
And see if we got any records
on this guy.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.400
Anything that can give us a clue.

11:18.572 --> 11:19.901
Lido's on board.

11:20.074 --> 11:22.234
- What's your gut say, Haleh?
- Low potassium.

11:22.411 --> 11:23.954
- Lydia?
- Cocaine.

11:24.122 --> 11:26.829
His wife says he's tox-free.
We'll know soon enough.

11:27.002 --> 11:29.079
Heart rate's up to 210.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.923
Let's try and cardiovert. Paddles.
Start him at 100.

11:34.806 --> 11:36.800
- Hands off!
- Clear.

11:36.977 --> 11:38.769
- Faint pulse.
- There we go. Nice rhythm.

11:38.938 --> 11:41.312
- He's moved his head.
- His rate's down to 160.

11:41.484 --> 11:44.570
- One-eighty. Here we go again.
- All right, lidocaine's not working.

11:44.739 --> 11:48.740
Let's try bretylium, 500 IV push.
Prep a transvenous pacemaker.

11:48.913 --> 11:51.750
Charge 200. Hands off!

11:53.587 --> 11:55.462
What makes you think
there's an aneurysm?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.041
The calcium plaque
on the descending aorta.

11:58.220 --> 12:01.805
While you saved his life, you made
the Norwegian surgeons very unhappy.

12:01.976 --> 12:03.008
- Good work.
- Thank you.

12:03.186 --> 12:05.311
- Where's the patient?
- Room 6.

12:05.482 --> 12:06.858
To Room 6.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.195
Hey, way to go, Carter.

12:12.869 --> 12:15.444
Labs are back.
Lytes are normal, tox screen's negative.

12:15.623 --> 12:16.822
We were both wrong.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.540
- What the hell's wrong with this guy?
- Rate's up to 220.

12:19.713 --> 12:22.965
- Faint pulse.
- All right, pacer's in.

12:23.136 --> 12:26.554
Let's overdrive him to 230.
Maximum gain.

12:26.725 --> 12:29.597
- See if I can grab hold of this rhythm.
- You've got capture.

12:29.771 --> 12:32.691
Lovely. Let's take him down slowly.

12:32.860 --> 12:35.352
- Two-ten.
- Two hundred.

12:35.531 --> 12:36.730
One-eighty.

12:36.908 --> 12:39.401
- He's jumping back up.
- Lost capture.

12:39.579 --> 12:42.701
Let's start CPR. Add Pronestyl,
100 mgs, IV push.

12:42.876 --> 12:44.787
Paddles, set them at 360.

12:44.963 --> 12:46.921
- What time is it?
-0845.

12:47.091 --> 12:48.255
Mark that time.

12:48.427 --> 12:50.421
- Hands off. Clear.
- Clear.

12:53.519 --> 12:55.892
- Wide-complex tachycardia.
- Still no pulse.

12:56.064 --> 12:57.773
- Time?
-9:05.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.517
- How long has he been down?
- Twenty minutes.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.783
Tried the pacer, he went into V-fib.
Shocked him 15-20 times.

13:03.952 --> 13:05.745
He keeps running these chaotic rhythms.

13:05.914 --> 13:09.166
- Could he be hypocalcemic?
- No, lytes are fine.

13:09.378 --> 13:11.668
- Cocaine?
- Tox screen's negative.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.543
- Acidotic?
- Good question. Let's get another gas.

13:15.805 --> 13:17.633
- How much Pronestyl?
- That makes 900.

13:17.808 --> 13:19.683
- Time?
-0922.

13:19.853 --> 13:22.524
- Another hundred of Pronestyl.
- Got your blood gases here:

13:22.691 --> 13:25.813
PH 7.24, PO-2's 110.

13:25.988 --> 13:28.066
- He's still in fib.
- He's going down.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.319
- The anti-arrhythmics?
- Still got a few more.

13:30.496 --> 13:33.035
- Stand by with the amiodarone.
- Charging up to 360.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.288
- Back up. Clear!
- Clear.

13:34.878 --> 13:37.631
- Time?
-0932.

13:37.799 --> 13:40.719
- Still no pulse.
- Try magnesium sulfate.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.846
- Clear.
- Clear.

13:43.016 --> 13:44.809
- Time?
-9:41.

13:44.978 --> 13:48.183
- High dose epi, five mgs. Clear.
- Hit of epi in.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.485
- Time?
-9:45.

13:50.654 --> 13:52.197
- Clear!
- Clear.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.564
- Clear!
- Clear.

13:59.376 --> 14:01.370
32 years old.

14:03.341 --> 14:05.631
Time of death...

14:05.803 --> 14:07.465
...9:55.

14:11.897 --> 14:13.974
Why?

14:14.150 --> 14:17.023
There was an electrical disturbance
in your husband's heart...

14:17.197 --> 14:19.690
...that caused it to beat
in an irregular way.

14:20.703 --> 14:24.039
I wish I could tell you what caused
it to happen...

14:24.209 --> 14:27.164
...but the truth is, I don't know.

14:27.339 --> 14:28.882
Well, that's not good enough.

14:29.050 --> 14:33.133
I mean, we came in here,
and his heart was okay.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.594
You said it wasn't anything serious,
so somebody must have screwed up!

14:36.771 --> 14:39.228
- How did you let this happen?
- Mrs. Wimbur.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.441
What did you do to him?!

14:57.513 --> 14:59.507
Hello, Alvin.

15:00.435 --> 15:03.521
Well, do you have his new number?

15:04.900 --> 15:09.066
- So, Kerry-
- One second.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.368
Yes, Susan?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.494
I've been thinking about
your invitation...

15:13.664 --> 15:16.336
...and I would like to throw my hat in
for Chief Resident.

15:16.544 --> 15:19.832
I'm glad. I look forward
to showing you the ropes.

15:20.008 --> 15:21.468
Me too.

15:21.636 --> 15:25.387
Nobody's signed up
for the gallbladder in 2 yet.

15:26.644 --> 15:27.973
I've got it.

15:28.147 --> 15:31.352
- How long does a CAT scan take?
- Hopefully, not more than an hour...

15:31.527 --> 15:33.070
...but sometimes there's a wait.

15:33.238 --> 15:35.778
I'm a little concerned about my worms
in the truck.

15:35.951 --> 15:37.909
- You brought them with you?
- Just one bin.

15:38.079 --> 15:40.786
I was making a delivery
when the dizziness hit.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.748
- Do you think someone'll steal them?
- No, they're locked up.

15:43.922 --> 15:48.468
You don't leave $5000 worth of
worms unsecured, but they could freeze.

15:48.638 --> 15:52.555
Listen, if I gave you my keys,
could you bring them in out of the cold?

15:52.728 --> 15:56.431
- We can't have animals in the hospital.
- Oh, there's no danger.

15:56.610 --> 16:00.361
Worms are the only disease-free
organisms on Earth. It's a fact.

16:00.533 --> 16:04.200
- I really shouldn't.
- Please, they're my worms.

16:04.873 --> 16:06.416
- All right.
- Thank you.

16:06.584 --> 16:08.792
And could you feed them, please?

16:08.963 --> 16:12.251
- What do they eat?
- Table scraps, as long as it's vegetarian.

16:12.427 --> 16:15.549
Nothing too greasy because
fat doesn't sit well with worms.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.646
Mrs. D'Angelo, I see you've been
with us before.

16:18.813 --> 16:21.270
- Gallstones flaring up again?
- They're killing me.

16:21.442 --> 16:25.394
I can't sleep, I can't eat. And every
three weeks, I end up back here.

16:25.574 --> 16:26.903
Pain pills didn't help?

16:27.076 --> 16:29.366
I took twice as much.
Didn't do anything.

16:29.539 --> 16:31.948
- Yeah, you shouldn't do that.
- Please, doctor...

16:32.126 --> 16:35.497
...get a surgeon to take
these damn stones out.

16:35.674 --> 16:39.211
It's been going on like this
for six months now.

16:40.849 --> 16:42.641
Okay. Sorry.

16:42.852 --> 16:44.645
Okay.

16:44.814 --> 16:48.517
I'll get an ultrasound. Unless your
condition is life-threatening...

16:48.695 --> 16:51.781
...any surgery would be considered
elective, and unfortunately...

16:51.950 --> 16:54.525
- There's an 18-month waiting list.
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

16:54.705 --> 16:58.919
- My neighbor got hers out the next day.
- Does she have private insurance?

16:59.630 --> 17:01.837
Is it my fault I'm on Medicaid?

17:02.008 --> 17:05.261
Okay, we'll start with the ultrasound
and see what we have.

17:05.973 --> 17:07.005
Thank you.

17:09.311 --> 17:11.721
His name is Alan Wimbur.
You guys just picked him up.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.893
I was hoping you could
do the autopsy today.

17:14.069 --> 17:16.479
- Hey, Jerry, where's the ultrasound?
- You've got me.

17:16.656 --> 17:19.411
Let me know,
because I'd like to observe.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.611
Autopsy?

17:20.789 --> 17:23.163
I wanna find out what happened
to his heart.

17:23.335 --> 17:24.616
You should go home.

17:24.796 --> 17:28.048
His wife accused me of killing him.
She's probably gonna sue.

17:28.218 --> 17:30.924
People get upset and feel
they need to blame someone.

17:31.098 --> 17:34.884
I heard a murmur on exam. Before
getting an echo, I wanted to get a CT.

17:35.062 --> 17:38.398
Yeah, guy comes in with a seizure,
first thing you want is a CT.

17:38.735 --> 17:40.016
Thanks, I was just checking.

17:40.196 --> 17:44.492
Dr. Greene? Dr. Morgenstern's office
just called. He'd like to see you upstairs.

17:44.662 --> 17:46.869
Word travels fast.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.877
- You're making excellent time, Peter.
- Suction!

17:50.045 --> 17:53.666
Let Carter suction. It's his reward for
hunting down an aneurysm like a hound.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.718
I feel privileged for the opportunity.

17:55.888 --> 17:58.761
- Well, now, that's what I call suction.
- Thank you, thank you.

17:58.935 --> 18:02.721
- MacGruder, is this patient warm?
- Shoot, shoot, shoot!

18:02.900 --> 18:04.561
- MacGruder!
- Temp is 106.

18:04.736 --> 18:07.608
- He has malignant hypothermia.
- Is he reacting to anesthesia?

18:07.783 --> 18:10.739
Give him dantrolene, get ice packs,
cooling blankets.

18:10.913 --> 18:14.747
If we don't get his temp down, he's
gonna have scrambled eggs for brains.

18:14.919 --> 18:18.207
Who took this patient's history?
He was intolerant to fluoroethane.

18:18.383 --> 18:22.300
Damn it! I lay out a banquet
and you crap all over my table!

18:22.473 --> 18:24.847
- He never had an operation.
- Cooling blankets!

18:25.019 --> 18:29.601
Well, lift him up, get him under. Peter,
come on over here. Evert the cortex.

18:29.777 --> 18:32.151
Log-roll him over. Suction, Peter.

18:32.323 --> 18:36.074
5.0 proline, more ice.
Tie that off, Peter.

18:36.246 --> 18:37.990
- He never had an operation before?
- No.

18:38.166 --> 18:42.296
Well, you're right, there was no way
of knowing. My apologies. Metz! Metz!

18:44.217 --> 18:46.176
Are you free for lunch?

18:50.352 --> 18:51.634
- Susan?
- Yeah.

18:51.813 --> 18:54.520
Medical records sent down
the chart on your gallstone lady.

18:54.693 --> 18:55.939
- Thanks.
- I took a peek.

18:56.112 --> 18:58.153
- I know she's been on cefoxitin.
- Yeah.

18:58.324 --> 19:01.492
Cefotaxime has better
biliary penetration.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.451
I know it's hard memorizing
all the antibiotics out there...

19:04.626 --> 19:07.118
- ... but it's well worth the time.
- Right.

19:07.297 --> 19:09.172
- Who's the ultrasound for?
- Same lady.

19:09.342 --> 19:11.086
Didn't she have one last month?

19:11.262 --> 19:14.847
She's complaining of more pain. I wanna
rule out obstruction and cholangitis.

19:15.018 --> 19:18.721
Remember Charcot's triad. Cholangitis
is indicated by pain, fever and jaundice...

19:18.899 --> 19:20.228
...of which she has only one.

19:20.401 --> 19:23.072
You can rule her out without
the expense of an ultrasound.

19:23.239 --> 19:26.907
If you're gonna be Chief,
you gotta watch the bottom line.

19:28.832 --> 19:30.327
Mark.

19:30.501 --> 19:35.083
I don't believe you've met Kathy Snyder,
one of the hospital attorneys.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.253
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:37.429 --> 19:40.717
Is this about this cardiac arrest
who died this morning?

19:40.893 --> 19:44.099
- I haven't heard anything. Have you?
- No.

19:44.274 --> 19:46.434
Kathy wanted to talk about
the O'Brien lawsuit.

19:47.988 --> 19:50.445
- You get a court date?
- We've worked out a settlement.

19:51.411 --> 19:53.868
- I'm not sure I want to settle.
- The hospital is sure.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.072
It's a good thing.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.538
Mr. O'Brien gets compensated,
and you can put this behind you.

19:58.714 --> 20:00.957
If I settle, this will follow me
my entire career.

20:01.135 --> 20:03.674
Every time I apply for a staff job
or insurance...

20:03.848 --> 20:06.554
If we took it to trail,
we could lose 2 million easily.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.768
You wanna lug that around
your entire career?

20:08.939 --> 20:12.726
I've been over this a thousand times.
I didn't do anything wrong.

20:12.904 --> 20:15.231
It was a very complicated delivery.

20:15.408 --> 20:18.079
I did as good a job as any
emergency physician could have.

20:18.246 --> 20:22.626
Other emergency physicians would
and have disagreed with you.

20:26.051 --> 20:28.626
A pregnant woman comes in
with preeclampsia...

20:28.805 --> 20:31.298
...and for whatever reason,
you didn't pick up on it.

20:31.476 --> 20:33.969
Her condition was masked
by urinary infection!

20:34.147 --> 20:36.687
I don't want to argue the details
with you, Mark.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.812
You make thousands of diagnoses
a year, 99 percent of them are right on.

20:40.992 --> 20:44.113
- You made a mistake, as we all do.
- I don't accept that.

20:44.289 --> 20:47.327
- Mark, please-
- This is about my reputation as a doctor.

20:47.502 --> 20:49.746
I'm not gonna settle.
Take my name off of it.

20:50.424 --> 20:52.418
You can't separate yourself
from the suit.

20:52.594 --> 20:55.930
Well, I'll hire my own lawyer,
and I'll fight it myself.

21:01.483 --> 21:05.318
- That's a lot of worms.
- Hey, big fella.

21:05.490 --> 21:08.065
- Woman makes a fortune selling these.
- To whom?

21:08.245 --> 21:11.200
Landscapers, farmers.
Could be a great sideline.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.333
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

21:13.503 --> 21:15.248
This could pay
for the hole in my roof.

21:15.423 --> 21:18.212
- I took the spoiled food from the fridge.
- Veggie?

21:18.386 --> 21:21.057
- That's what you asked for.
- They don't like grease.

21:21.224 --> 21:23.551
How do they feel about yogurt?

21:24.897 --> 21:26.891
I don't hear any complaining.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.727
Eat up, little worms.

21:31.741 --> 21:33.236
John!

21:34.663 --> 21:36.491
- Hi.
- Told you it was an aneurysm.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.707
- You were right.
- Did Vucelich know who I was?

21:42.676 --> 21:44.586
Didn't you tell him about me?

21:46.140 --> 21:48.633
- That I found it?
- I meant to.

21:48.811 --> 21:50.187
I mean, I should have.

21:50.856 --> 21:52.517
The whole thing
happened really fast.

21:53.777 --> 21:57.231
I was gonna say something,
and they just assumed that...

22:11.223 --> 22:13.216
What are you doing in here?

22:14.061 --> 22:17.229
The hospital decided
to settle the O'Brien suit.

22:18.234 --> 22:20.027
Isn't that good news?

22:20.196 --> 22:23.483
Morgenstern thinks I'm at fault
for not picking up the preeclampsia.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.497
- That's not fair. He wasn't even there.
- You were there.

22:28.543 --> 22:32.495
It was as complicated a case as I've
ever seen. You did everything you could.

22:32.674 --> 22:35.167
You think I should have caught
the preeclampsia?

22:35.345 --> 22:38.099
It was a difficult diagnosis.
Anyone could have missed it.

22:38.267 --> 22:40.676
If you were called up
on the witness stand and asked:

22:40.854 --> 22:42.813
"Did Greene screw up? "
What would you say?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.661
I'm sorry, Mark.

23:05.687 --> 23:06.932
Come on, dude. Be bold.

23:07.106 --> 23:10.025
We start our own investment club.
We collect right off the bat.

23:10.194 --> 23:12.235
- No, thanks, man.
- What's to lose?

23:12.406 --> 23:14.981
- What'd you lose? Two grand?
- Alvin's gonna come through.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.867
Can you find out why the worm lady
isn't back from CT?

23:18.040 --> 23:20.711
She had palpitations,
so they're doing a cardiac workup.

23:20.878 --> 23:22.338
Call me when she comes down.

23:22.506 --> 23:24.630
Jerry, medical records copy
a chart for me?

23:24.801 --> 23:27.210
- Yeah, O'Brien, right?
- Yeah, thanks.

23:28.057 --> 23:31.095
Hey! What happened to those worms
in Radiology?

23:31.270 --> 23:33.430
- They're doing a consult.
- No, those earthworms.

23:33.607 --> 23:36.017
I put a bucket of earthworms in there.
They're gone.

23:36.195 --> 23:37.987
Well, I didn't take them.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.780
Ray, I'm Dr. Ross.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.825
I understand you've been having
some headaches and missing school.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.373
- Yeah, they're pretty bad.
- Okay.

23:46.545 --> 23:49.833
- Where in your head does it hurt?
- Here.

23:51.804 --> 23:55.175
- How long you been having these?
- About a month.

23:55.351 --> 23:59.102
- How often?
- All the time, I guess.

24:01.111 --> 24:03.152
- Do you feel dizzy?
- Yeah.

24:03.323 --> 24:05.151
Okay, pull like that.

24:05.326 --> 24:07.997
- Play sports?
- J.V. football, middle linebacker.

24:08.164 --> 24:10.372
I was a running back.
We used to hate you guys.

24:10.543 --> 24:12.667
Squeeze my hand.

24:12.838 --> 24:16.174
- You ever get headaches playing sports?
- No.

24:16.344 --> 24:19.680
No. Okay. We're gonna get you
a CAT scan. You know what that is?

24:21.269 --> 24:23.346
No? It's when we take a picture
of your brain.

24:23.522 --> 24:26.015
We wanna make sure it's still in there.

24:26.778 --> 24:30.481
All right. I'll be back in a minute.

24:34.206 --> 24:39.002
Dr. Vucelich, Dr. Benton.
I'm sorry to say...

24:41.552 --> 24:45.005
Tradition holds they serve olives
and walnuts with the drink.

24:45.183 --> 24:47.889
Dr. Vucelich, Dr. Benton,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

24:48.062 --> 24:49.606
I misled you both earlier.

24:49.774 --> 24:52.693
The finder's fee for the aneurysm
should go to Harper Tracy.

24:52.904 --> 24:55.657
She's a third-year student.
She caught it.

24:55.825 --> 24:59.908
Taking credit for a colleague's work is
a very dangerous precedent, Mr. Carter.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.873
I can assure you that it will never
happen again.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.918
Well, your reassurance rings hollow
just now.

25:06.092 --> 25:08.929
One has to wonder if this is
a momentary lapse of integrity...

25:09.097 --> 25:11.091
...or a fundamental flaw
in your character.

25:11.851 --> 25:15.270
Well, time will tell. In any event,
the patient's secondary condition...

25:15.441 --> 25:18.112
...means he's not an appropriate
candidate for the study...

25:18.279 --> 25:20.107
...so there will be no finder's fee.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.037
- Is there anything else?
- No.

25:28.212 --> 25:30.205
Strange boy.

25:31.968 --> 25:35.719
- The patient is being excluded?
- What's that? Oh, yes.

25:35.891 --> 25:40.105
It seems that he has a history of,
excuse me, neurological problems...

25:40.273 --> 25:44.605
...which exceed the parameters
of the protocol, so...

25:44.780 --> 25:47.867
What were we talking about, Peter?
Oh, I remember.

25:48.036 --> 25:50.575
George Cinq. Walnuts, olives.

25:50.748 --> 25:54.831
Actually, I was an habitué of this bistro,
called "L'Ami Louis," and there was...

25:55.005 --> 25:59.504
- Mrs. D'Angelo. Feeling any better?
- No. Are you going to do that test?

25:59.680 --> 26:03.217
I consulted with another doctor, and
we feel the ultrasound is unnecessary.

26:03.394 --> 26:06.848
- You don't have any new symptoms.
- You're not even gonna check?

26:07.025 --> 26:10.646
Given that you don't have a fever
or any other symptoms...

26:10.823 --> 26:12.864
...there's no way
I can justify the expense.

26:13.035 --> 26:16.786
The expense. I see.

26:16.958 --> 26:21.421
I can take it from here.
I know the routine.

26:21.591 --> 26:27.217
The nurse gives me a few pills that don't
work, and I'm pushed out the door.

26:27.392 --> 26:29.718
I checked with the elective
surgery waiting list...

26:29.896 --> 26:32.139
...and they can get you in
by the end of the year.

26:32.316 --> 26:33.977
It's February 1 st.

26:36.490 --> 26:38.947
- Help!
- What happened?

26:39.119 --> 26:41.659
They were out by the trash.
Must've been there an hour.

26:41.832 --> 26:45.037
Get some blankets, heat up some
saline, we'll do a warm-water lavage.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.884
- The lamps they use on newborns.
- Great idea.

26:48.050 --> 26:49.925
Go up to OB, see if they'll lend us some.

26:53.059 --> 26:55.551
- All right. Oh, damn it!
- The lid's frozen.

26:55.730 --> 26:58.483
Oh, God! All right.
Rib spreader, rib spreader.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.025
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna knock it loose.

27:01.197 --> 27:03.072
- What do you got?
- Hypothermia, earthworms.

27:03.242 --> 27:05.402
- Five grand worth.
- Earthworms?

27:05.579 --> 27:08.416
Yeah. They're Belgian.
They don't take kindly to cold.

27:08.584 --> 27:10.163
Got it, got it!

27:10.337 --> 27:12.664
- Oh, no!
- It's frozen solid.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.965
Well, maybe they're still alive
underneath.

27:15.136 --> 27:17.214
Surgical mallet, reflex hammer.

27:19.435 --> 27:22.058
Thanks. All right. All right.

27:23.316 --> 27:26.770
Oh, no.
What am I gonna tell Mrs. Henry?

27:29.118 --> 27:32.489
Good news, buddy.
Your brain's right were it should be.

27:32.665 --> 27:35.372
- All right. Let's talk about school.
- Why?

27:35.545 --> 27:38.832
Well, because school can cause stress,
and stress can cause headaches.

27:39.009 --> 27:42.296
Do you have any trouble with your
classes or students or teachers...

27:42.473 --> 27:43.849
- ... or anything like that?
- No.

27:44.017 --> 27:45.845
All right, what about your girlfriend?

27:46.020 --> 27:49.522
- Which one?
- There's a problem right there.

27:49.693 --> 27:53.360
- How many girlfriends do you have?
- A few. I don't know.

27:53.533 --> 27:55.491
All right.
You're not doing drugs, are you?

27:55.661 --> 27:57.536
- Smoking pot?
- No.

27:57.706 --> 27:59.616
- No?
- No.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.798
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

28:08.390 --> 28:10.384
What's the matter?

28:13.607 --> 28:16.563
I can't. I can't.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.530
What?

28:19.951 --> 28:23.868
- There's something wrong with me.
- Okay.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.578
All guys who are your age, they think
that there's something wrong with them.

28:27.755 --> 28:29.334
No.

28:30.551 --> 28:33.839
- I'm different.
- How are you different?

28:38.606 --> 28:40.600
The girls at school...

28:44.574 --> 28:45.904
I...

28:47.788 --> 28:50.957
I don't feel anything
when I'm around them.

28:55.426 --> 28:57.419
I think I'm gay.

29:00.142 --> 29:02.385
I know I am.

29:04.482 --> 29:08.149
I mean, what am I supposed to tell
my dad, my brothers?

29:12.412 --> 29:16.281
I'm just sick of being this fake person.

29:19.632 --> 29:20.831
Haleh, will you call Psych?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.762
See if we can get a Resident
down to look at the kid in 1.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.924
Preferably someone
from adolescent medicine.

29:26.101 --> 29:28.142
- What's the problem?
- Kid thinks he's gay.

29:28.313 --> 29:31.684
Needs somebody to talk to.
I'm going to lunch.

29:35.825 --> 29:38.234
I'll check the charts.
Try and make yourself useful.

29:38.412 --> 29:39.789
Okay.

29:39.957 --> 29:42.663
Hey, good catch this morning
on the aneurysm.

29:42.836 --> 29:45.756
Harper, Carter, give me a hand.

29:45.925 --> 29:47.301
- What happened?
- She collapsed.

29:47.469 --> 29:49.297
Acute shortness of breath,
chest pain.

29:49.472 --> 29:52.760
- Pulse is high.
- Carter, start on an oxygen mask.

29:54.940 --> 29:58.892
- Harper, what do we order?
- EKG, chest film, blood gas...

29:59.071 --> 30:01.279
- ... Chem-7, CBC, cardiac enzymes.
- And?

30:01.450 --> 30:03.076
- Myoglobin.
- Myoglobin.

30:03.245 --> 30:04.989
- Do it.
- She has neck-vein distention.

30:05.165 --> 30:08.167
- Temp's 101.
- Susan?

30:08.336 --> 30:10.911
- Chief complaint?
- Shortness of breath, chest pain.

30:11.091 --> 30:13.928
- She has a history of renal failure.
- What's the differential?

30:14.096 --> 30:16.090
- Susan?
- Harper?

30:16.266 --> 30:18.675
Acute MI, pulmonary embolism,
pneumonia...

30:18.854 --> 30:21.856
- ...pericarditis, congestive heart failure.
- Pleural effusion.

30:22.026 --> 30:23.936
Pleural effusion. Stop that!

30:24.112 --> 30:27.281
- Prompting from the peanut gallery?
- Let's get a gas cooking.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.575
Get an EKG,
let's see how her heart's doing.

30:29.746 --> 30:30.778
After you.

30:42.476 --> 30:44.304
Hell of a way to spend your day off.

30:44.479 --> 30:47.482
Yeah. Wish I never would have come in.
Believe me.

30:47.651 --> 30:49.395
What's that? Jody O'Brien?

30:49.571 --> 30:52.324
It's the first time I looked at that
since the big day.

30:52.492 --> 30:56.362
She had two high BPs, proteinuria.
I missed a preeclampsia.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.822
If I hadn't, she'd be alive.

30:58.001 --> 31:01.586
- Could've happened to any of us.
- It's not supposed to happen to me.

31:01.757 --> 31:04.713
- Well, you are arrogant.
- Arrogant?

31:04.929 --> 31:07.848
It's like there's you and the Pope.
You guys are infallible.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.724
- Then, of course, there's the rest of us.
- Yeah?

31:11.774 --> 31:14.349
Well, after today,
the Pope's on his own.

31:14.737 --> 31:16.778
Good.

31:16.949 --> 31:19.738
I think I might have killed
that guy this morning.

31:20.287 --> 31:21.699
Mark. Hey, Mark!

31:21.873 --> 31:24.081
When I first checked his heart,
I heard a murmur.

31:24.252 --> 31:25.878
He must've had a congenital defect.

31:26.047 --> 31:28.290
That guy crashed 10 minutes
after he got in there.

31:28.468 --> 31:30.296
There's nothing you could have done.

31:30.471 --> 31:32.465
Yeah, yeah. Yes, there is.

31:32.975 --> 31:36.061
Could've gotten an echo, and then
I could've gotten him to the O.R.

31:36.230 --> 31:39.732
You're holding yourself
to a ridiculous standard, Mark.

31:40.362 --> 31:43.864
- I gotta get to an autopsy.
- It's your day off. Go home!

31:49.043 --> 31:50.242
Low-voltage EKG.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.081
- BP's falling.
- She's decompensating.

31:52.256 --> 31:53.966
- Where's that blood gas?
- I'll check.

31:54.135 --> 31:56.259
- You got it?
- These numbers don't make sense.

31:57.014 --> 31:59.341
- What?
- You hit a vein instead of an artery.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.678
- Is that the blood gas?
- Yeah, no. I mean yeah.

32:01.855 --> 32:05.061
- But I tapped a vein instead of an artery.
- No, I tapped a vein.

32:05.236 --> 32:07.230
Whoever did it,
do it again and do it right.

32:07.406 --> 32:08.438
Carter, you do it.

32:08.617 --> 32:12.035
- Non-specific ST changes.
- Where are we? Susan?

32:12.206 --> 32:13.535
I don't know where you are...

32:13.708 --> 32:16.795
- ... I'm at pericardial effusion.
- Or pump failure, or an embolism.

32:16.964 --> 32:20.549
- Let's get an echo!
- Positive Ewart's sign.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.714
Pressure's down, 50/30.

32:24.434 --> 32:26.013
Pericardiocentesis tray!

32:26.187 --> 32:29.641
Shouldn't you confirm your diagnosis
before sticking a needle in her heart?

32:29.818 --> 32:33.189
- I've made my diagnosis.
- Alligator clamp is on the needle.

32:33.365 --> 32:36.819
The diagnostic gold standard
is an echocardiogram.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.408
You wait while Tech comes down.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.157
I'll see if there's any fluid
around her heart. Okay.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.178
I'm in.

32:53.231 --> 32:56.104
- Anything yet?
- No, not yet.

33:00.368 --> 33:02.943
- Here it comes.
- What do you know?

33:03.122 --> 33:06.375
Looks cloudy. I wonder if it's
transudate or exudate fluid.

33:06.545 --> 33:11.423
Anyone know the gold standard
to differentiate the two? Kerry?

33:11.595 --> 33:13.220
Measure LDH to protein.

33:13.389 --> 33:17.057
What's the LDH ratio
to identify exudate fluid?

33:17.229 --> 33:20.730
- I'd have to look it up.
- It's. 5 to 1.

33:35.801 --> 33:37.629
- Greene?
- Yeah.

33:37.804 --> 33:41.092
You guys should come here more often,
brush up on your gross anatomy.

33:41.268 --> 33:44.354
- You guys find anything conclusive?
- Why, what are you looking for?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.942
- Something wrong with the heart.
- Think you missed something?

33:48.113 --> 33:52.493
- Possibly.
- Well, you came at just the right time.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.323
Size and shape normal.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.088
380 grams.
Okay. Who wants to section this?

33:59.256 --> 34:03.636
Bill? I think it's your turn.
Martin, will you hand him a knife?

34:17.034 --> 34:20.406
Doug. It's been an hour, and Psych still
hasn't come down for that boy.

34:20.581 --> 34:23.538
- All right, I'll call them.
- Why don't you talk to him yourself?

34:23.713 --> 34:27.463
Because there's nothing physically wrong
with him, and I have four other patients.

34:27.636 --> 34:30.092
Is it because the kid's gay?

34:32.018 --> 34:34.771
- What?
- You heard me.

34:36.692 --> 34:39.446
If you mean, is it because
that boy's particular problems...

34:39.614 --> 34:42.616
...fall out of my frame of reference
or my area of expertise...

34:42.784 --> 34:44.993
...then the answer is yes.

34:45.164 --> 34:48.370
If you mean, is it because
I'm homophobic...

34:48.545 --> 34:50.835
...then the answer is no. Okay?

34:55.431 --> 34:58.054
No congenital or valvular anomalies.

34:58.227 --> 35:02.559
Endocardium normal. Myocardium
of normal thickness and color.

35:02.735 --> 35:05.025
Blood vessels at base, normal.

35:05.197 --> 35:09.197
Coronary ostia are in the usual
anatomical position.

35:09.371 --> 35:13.786
Arteries show no sign of plaque.
He's normal.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.881
- No sign of anything congenital?
- Were you here a second ago?

35:17.050 --> 35:19.008
What was the cause of death?

35:19.178 --> 35:21.552
Typical ER thinking.
Gotta be cause and effect.

35:21.975 --> 35:24.811
See, down here we operate
on a slightly different gestalt.

35:24.979 --> 35:28.932
Sometimes there are answers,
but many times, mystery.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.815
It's not very satisfying.

35:32.533 --> 35:34.741
You think you're a scientist?

35:34.912 --> 35:38.782
You want explanations, hard answers,
algorithms of care? That's dog crap.

35:39.211 --> 35:42.380
Medicine's an art. And art is ambiguous.

35:43.051 --> 35:46.671
All right. Preliminary results:
Idiopathic dysrhythmia.

35:46.849 --> 35:48.842
No known cause of death.

35:54.778 --> 35:58.114
- Nurse?
- Hi, how are you feeling?

35:58.284 --> 35:59.660
Oh, tired.

35:59.828 --> 36:03.911
They gave me a million-dollar workup
and couldn't find anything wrong.

36:04.085 --> 36:06.494
I just want to take my worms
and go home.

36:07.674 --> 36:10.214
I have some bad news for you.

36:10.387 --> 36:13.924
Your worms were mistaken for trash
and put outside in the snow.

36:14.101 --> 36:15.513
- No.
- By the time I found out...

36:15.687 --> 36:18.145
...they were already frozen solid.
We brought them in.

36:18.317 --> 36:22.483
We tried to warm them with blankets
and water. We used all our capabilities.

36:22.657 --> 36:26.527
But we couldn't get them back.
I'm very sorry.

36:28.625 --> 36:30.536
Can I see them?

36:36.638 --> 36:39.807
- What's that?
- Vucelich's study protocol.

36:39.977 --> 36:44.476
"Parameters for exclusionary status. "
Are you excluding someone?

36:44.651 --> 36:47.857
- Vucelich did.
- Anyone I know?

36:48.032 --> 36:50.655
The guy we worked on today.
He went bad.

36:50.828 --> 36:53.285
He ever drop people who do well?

36:54.334 --> 36:58.334
Why are you reading this now?
Has he dropped someone before this?

36:58.883 --> 37:00.924
Mrs. Rubadoux.

37:02.347 --> 37:04.257
He's not- I mean...

37:04.434 --> 37:08.351
Vucelich wouldn't drop bad outcomes
just to pretty-up his numbers, would he?

37:09.859 --> 37:11.189
I don't know.

37:12.656 --> 37:16.359
I don't need you to hide my mistakes.
If I screw up, let me deal with it.

37:16.537 --> 37:18.697
- You're right.
- Don't lie on my behalf.

37:18.874 --> 37:20.037
- I won't.
- It's insulting.

37:20.210 --> 37:22.749
I got it, okay? I gave you the credit.
What do you want?

37:22.922 --> 37:25.545
- What is with you today?
- Sorry, this Residency thing.

37:25.719 --> 37:27.878
My chances of getting in here
are about 1 in 50.

37:28.056 --> 37:31.759
I don't even have an interview set up
yet. I'm gonna end up in North Dakota.

37:32.605 --> 37:33.637
- Damn it.
- What?

37:33.815 --> 37:38.776
I forgot Dr. Benton's TPN orders. None
of his post-ops are getting their IVs.

37:40.493 --> 37:46.001
- Susan?
- One second.

37:46.169 --> 37:47.201
Yes, Kerry?

37:47.379 --> 37:50.881
According to The Washington Manual,
the determinative LDH ratio...

37:51.052 --> 37:53.591
...isn't .5 to 1, it's .6.

37:53.765 --> 37:55.176
Oh, you got me again.

37:55.350 --> 37:57.760
If you're gonna be Chief,
get your facts straight.

38:00.734 --> 38:03.821
You know, if being Chief means
having you breathing down my back...

38:03.990 --> 38:08.286
...to hell with it. I don't want you
as my mentor. Just stay out of my way.

38:09.248 --> 38:12.453
That's the first time I've ever seen you
act like a Chief Resident.

38:12.629 --> 38:14.789
Maybe Morgenstern was right.

38:25.817 --> 38:28.025
Where are you going?
I was coming to talk to you.

38:28.196 --> 38:30.154
I was telling my dad
how good I'm feeling.

38:30.324 --> 38:33.493
It was taking a long time. The nurse
said the CAT scan, it was okay?

38:33.663 --> 38:37.081
- Yeah, it's normal.
- No tumors, or- I hate to tell you...

38:37.252 --> 38:39.745
- ... what's been going through my head.
- He's fine.

38:39.923 --> 38:42.048
Thank God.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.548
It could be migraines.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.475
Yes, it could also be stress-related,
something I wanted...

38:46.643 --> 38:48.435
...to talk to Ray about,
if I could-

38:48.604 --> 38:50.812
I know what it is. It's that damn trig.

38:50.983 --> 38:53.606
Every time I have one of those quizzes,
I get headaches.

38:53.779 --> 38:55.025
- You're kidding.
- No, I do.

38:55.198 --> 38:57.026
- Could that be what it is?
- It could.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.777
Because if that's it,
I mean, I know the prescription.

38:59.956 --> 39:02.034
Applying the seat of your pants
to the chair.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.491
Yeah.

39:03.712 --> 39:07.463
Button your coat. I'm sorry about this.
I spent the whole damn day waiting.

39:07.635 --> 39:08.799
It's okay.

39:08.971 --> 39:12.722
Listen, Ray, if you wanna talk
about this or anything else at all...

39:12.894 --> 39:15.565
- ... you just call me here, okay?
- Sure.

39:19.822 --> 39:23.739
Well, I thought she was
still at Beth Israel...

39:23.912 --> 39:26.784
...doing whatever it is she does.
Oh, right, right.

39:26.959 --> 39:29.961
- He's on the phone. Be off in a minute.
- I don't need him anyway.

39:30.131 --> 39:32.290
I just wanna get the records
on a patient.

39:32.468 --> 39:35.424
- Which one?
- Rubadoux, Sylvie.

39:36.182 --> 39:38.853
I believe she was dropped.

39:40.105 --> 39:42.942
Claire, could you come here?
I can't find my pocket schedule.

39:43.110 --> 39:44.771
Help yourself.

39:44.946 --> 39:47.237
Yeah, my life is unraveling
as we speak.

39:47.409 --> 39:49.367
What jacket did you wear
to the lecture?

39:49.537 --> 39:52.326
Claire, let's be serious.
How can I possibly know?

39:52.500 --> 39:55.123
Why don't you just find my schedule
like I asked you to?

39:55.297 --> 39:58.964
Who's that? Who's been asking?
No, tell me. Kemper's been asking?

39:59.136 --> 40:02.638
Well, you can tell Kemper
that I am centimeters away.

40:02.809 --> 40:05.728
With any luck, I'll be in the New England
Journal next month...

40:12.575 --> 40:18.083
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26...

40:19.879 --> 40:23.499
- Damn, man. Where'd you get all that?
- Alvin came through.

40:23.676 --> 40:26.964
- No guts, no glory.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

40:27.140 --> 40:30.594
- Life ain't fair.
- Are you gonna report that to the IRS?

40:30.771 --> 40:32.646
I assume that's a rhetorical question.

40:32.816 --> 40:36.022
Well, I'm gonna make my fortune
the old-fashioned legal way.

40:36.197 --> 40:38.903
- Delivering Chinese food?
- No, raising earthworms.

40:39.077 --> 40:41.652
- I got a dozen in there.
- I thought they froze to death.

40:41.831 --> 40:45.534
No, most of them moved into the middle
of the bin for warmth and survived.

40:45.712 --> 40:47.291
You took that lady's worms.

40:47.465 --> 40:51.252
No, she gave me enough to start my
own colony. It's my ticket out of here.

40:51.430 --> 40:53.554
Come on, guys, let's go home.
Good night.

40:53.726 --> 40:56.432
- Good night.
- Bye.

41:00.737 --> 41:02.695
- Didn't mean to scare you.
- No, you didn't.

41:02.866 --> 41:05.654
I finished your discharge summaries,
called in your orders...

41:05.829 --> 41:08.286
...and I rounded the patients upstairs.
Can I go home?

41:08.458 --> 41:10.998
- Bye, Carter.
- I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

41:13.341 --> 41:15.086
Good night.

41:15.261 --> 41:16.922
- Carter?
- Yeah?

41:17.097 --> 41:20.468
- Were the TPN orders called in on time?
- Yeah.

41:21.605 --> 41:24.560
No. I screwed up again.
They were 45 minutes late.

41:24.735 --> 41:27.737
I know. I called the pharmacy.

41:53.740 --> 41:57.788
- So are we sworn enemies forever?
- No.

42:00.335 --> 42:04.834
Denial's a funny thing. It keeps you
from asking the scary questions.

42:05.009 --> 42:06.089
Which ones?

42:06.303 --> 42:09.259
The ones I've been asking myself
all day today.

42:09.433 --> 42:11.593
Am I dangerous?

42:11.770 --> 42:14.808
Should I be practicing medicine?

42:15.359 --> 42:17.068
We all ask those questions.

42:17.237 --> 42:20.240
And the answers are "no" and "yes. "
In that order.

42:21.077 --> 42:24.863
I hope so.
I lost my family for this job.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.497
You're wallowing.

42:29.674 --> 42:31.300
Yes, I am wallowing.

42:32.220 --> 42:35.556
The first good wallow I've had
in a while, so don't ruin it.

42:36.101 --> 42:38.095
Well, I'm gonna drive home.
You want a ride?

42:38.272 --> 42:42.735
No. I jogged in, I'm gonna jog out.

42:43.948 --> 42:46.737
- Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
- Definitely.

42:47.078 --> 42:50.579
You know that guy who died
this morning? It wasn't my fault.

42:50.750 --> 42:53.670
I did everything right,
and he died anyway.

42:54.507 --> 42:57.759
- So, what's the lesson in that?
- Can't win.

42:59.181 --> 43:02.801
Oh, man. You are wallowing.

43:04.314 --> 43:06.392
- Good night.
- Night.

43:09.489 --> 43:10.819
- Susan?
- Yeah?

43:10.992 --> 43:14.410
Did anybody think it was odd,
my coming in today?

43:15.958 --> 43:16.990
No.

43:18.337 --> 43:19.666
I was just checking.

43:22.302 --> 43:24.177
- Night.
- Good night.
