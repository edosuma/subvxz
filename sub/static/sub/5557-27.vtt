You're getting used to this,

04:04.850 --> 04:10.021
Pharrell.
>> i think -- i think everyone

04:10.155 --> 04:13.057
In this room owes it to this
incredible form of humility

04:13.192 --> 04:15.159
Right here, to stand up just
like everybody -- everybody at

04:15.294 --> 04:22.634
Home.
[ cheers and applause ]

04:22.768 --> 04:26.037
Stand up.
Because that is exactly -- i can

04:26.171 --> 04:33.745
Guarantee you, anybody with
eyes, ears and a heart and a

04:33.879 --> 04:37.415
Mind, they are standing up back
home in america right now.

04:37.549 --> 04:42.654

Fantastic.

Knows that julie andrews and
"the sound of music" and that

04:52.431 --> 04:55.066
Song are my favorite ever, ever.
So to be sitting here at the end

04:55.200 --> 04:58.102
Of this year and hear you
singing that, i had to hold back

04:58.237 --> 05:01.539
Everything.
The flood was about ready to --

05:01.674 --> 05:03.508
If it wasn't for the makeup, it
would be done!

05:03.642 --> 05:05.777
But thank you so much.
And i think that you have

05:05.911 --> 05:07.812
Something.
Like a message for everyone out

05:07.946 --> 05:09.914
There.
That's -- there's a message.

05:10.049 --> 05:12.216

I don't have much time to say
the things -- to organize my

05:24.830 --> 05:28.599
Thoughts here.
But i'm just going to tell you

05:28.734 --> 05:33.037
That what's amazing about this
guy is, not -- my belief in

05:33.172 --> 05:39.410
Jordan is fine.
But jordan's belief in himself

05:39.545 --> 05:42.880
And the humble nature with which
he projects that into the world

05:43.015 --> 05:46.351
Is one of the most beautiful
things i've ever seen.

05:46.485 --> 05:47.352
And -- he deserves to win the
show.

05:47.486 --> 05:49.821
That would be great everything
and.

05:49.955 --> 05:52.623
But he is so unbelievably
graceful for all that he has.

05:52.758 --> 05:54.492
And is just out there doing what
he loves and what he's

05:54.626 --> 05:59.397
Passionate about.
And that to me deserves --

Hi, coach pharrell.
Let's start with you.

09:37.683 --> 09:40.084
>> of man, you know.
I talk to blake all of the time

09:40.218 --> 09:43.421
About you.
Just how crazy it is to me that

09:43.555 --> 09:46.023
You have such a classic voice.
And i know week after week, i

09:46.158 --> 09:49.994
Said the same thing about you.
But it's really -- it's really a

09:50.128 --> 09:51.729
True testament to, like, your
consistency.

09:51.863 --> 09:54.899
You consistently come out here
and do something very classic

09:55.033 --> 09:57.668
Every week.
And that's different, man.

09:57.803 --> 09:59.971
And it's special.
And i really look forward to

10:00.105 --> 10:02.039
Seeing what you do with your
career, because you definitely

10:02.174 --> 10:04.041
Have one.

>> carson: Can you, pharrell.
Let's go over to adam.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.949
>> you know, a lot of times on
the show we kind of like defer

10:12.084 --> 10:16.220
To blake, because he's a country
guy, and --

>> audience: Ow!
>> okay, calm down.

10:18.624 --> 10:21.559
Thank you.
But i think that when someone is

10:21.693 --> 10:25.496
So incredible as far as country
music is concerned, we can tell

10:25.631 --> 10:29.600
What the real deal is.
And if i'm not mistaken, mr.

10:29.735 --> 10:32.536
Shelton, you would not argue.
You are the real deal.

10:32.671 --> 10:36.841

>> thank you.

10:36.975 --> 10:38.709

10:38.844 --> 10:43.114
Beautiful performance.
I'll tell you the thing that i

10:43.248 --> 10:46.250
Have picked up on and the entire
country music fan base out there

10:46.385 --> 10:50.287
That watches this show, that's
the reason you're here in the

10:50.422 --> 10:52.990
Finale, is you possess this
vocal power.

10:53.125 --> 10:56.260
This range.
You have all of these things,

10:56.395 --> 10:58.262
All of these chops that you're
the master.

10:58.397 --> 11:03.034
But the best thing about your
performances is, you ramp it up.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.569
You start off simple, and as the
song goes along, as the song

11:05.704 --> 11:07.972
Builds, that's when you start
throwing in all of the power and

11:08.106 --> 11:09.840
Stuff.
And it makes for these

11:09.975 --> 11:14.345
Incredible performances that you
can't look away from.

11:14.479 --> 11:15.946

Tonight.
I'm sure made you more

20:02.640 --> 20:05.576
Emotional.
>> i have -- i mean, i feel like

20:05.710 --> 20:08.078
I was on another planet during
that whole thing, just thinking

20:08.213 --> 20:11.348
About your whole journey, and
when you first came out here.

20:11.482 --> 20:13.817
And you're just -- just your
vibe.

20:13.952 --> 20:19.056
Like your energy is so strong.
And i feel like tonight for me,

20:19.190 --> 20:22.192
Like it all  came together.
Because i feel like you were so

20:22.327 --> 20:23.860
Calm in that performance and
coming out and telling the

20:23.995 --> 20:26.063
Story.

to say.

20:32.370 --> 20:35.639
Blake?
>> let me tell you something.

20:35.773 --> 20:37.975
I mean, aside -- we can stop
talking about your technical

20:38.109 --> 20:40.277
Abilities and things when it
comes to your singing.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.813
There's a reason you made it to
the finale, because of -- that's

20:42.947 --> 20:45.616
Part of it.
But i think the thing that gwen

20:45.750 --> 20:49.119
Is talking about is the same
thing that i just noticed.

20:49.254 --> 20:53.790
And that's -- i don't know that
i've ever worked with anybody

20:53.925 --> 20:56.827
Who puts more heart into their
performances than you, barrett.

20:56.961 --> 21:00.364
I mean, every single time you
get on that stage, man.

21:00.498 --> 21:03.433
You just lay your heart out
there for everybody to see.

21:03.568 --> 21:05.302

21:44.609 --> 21:50.147
Here staring
at the clock on the wall

21:50.281 --> 21:53.884
And i've been ¶
¶ laying here praying

21:54.018 --> 21:58.422
Praying you won't call
it's just another call

21:58.556 --> 22:02.426
From home ¶
¶ and you'll get it

22:02.560 --> 22:10.334
And be gone
and i'll be crying

22:10.468 --> 22:14.338
And i'll be ¶
¶ begging you, baby

22:14.472 --> 22:18.875

What do i have to do ¶
¶ to make you see

22:46.304 --> 22:52.142
He can't love

¶ i'm down on my knees

22:57.682 --> 23:06.256

¶ don't give you what you need ¶
when she calls you to go

23:09.227 --> 23:11.928
There is one
thing you should know ¶

23:12.063 --> 23:21.304
¶ we don't have
to live this way

23:21.439 --> 23:28.145
Baby, why don't you stay

And i think i know
just what i have to do ¶

24:08.519 --> 24:11.988
¶ for mine
¶ why don't you stay ¶

24:12.123 --> 24:15.592
I'm up off my knees
i'm so tired of ¶

24:15.726 --> 24:18.728
¶ being lonely
you can't

24:18.863 --> 24:21.865
Give me what i need
when he begs ¶

¶ you not to go
there is one thing

24:26.270 --> 24:31.808
You should know

Representing team gwen.
Blake, let's start with you.

25:14.852 --> 25:20.657
>> man.
I like you doing country.

25:20.791 --> 25:24.294
That's awesome, man.
I don't know what to say any

25:24.428 --> 25:26.029
More to all four of you
finalists.

25:26.163 --> 25:28.365
You guys are all so incredible.
But i will say this about you,

25:28.499 --> 25:31.535
Jeffery.
You're the guy that from the

25:31.669 --> 25:36.773
Blind auditions to now, you
snuck up on all of us.

25:36.908 --> 25:41.244
And every time you get on that
stage, you make even more of a

25:41.379 --> 25:44.281
Believer of all of us.
So congratulations to making it

25:44.415 --> 25:45.549
This far.

>> hey, man.

25:48.553 --> 25:53.890
Yeah, i agree with blake.
Like, this must be an amazing

25:54.025 --> 25:55.759
Feeling for you, you know.
To have this journey on the

25:55.893 --> 26:00.530
Season like this.
And to think that, you know, you

26:00.665 --> 26:02.899
Haven't been singing for six
years or performing for six

26:03.034 --> 26:04.834
Years.
I can't imagine that you're not

26:04.969 --> 26:07.671
Inspiring somebody who has put
down the microphone for a bit

26:07.805 --> 26:09.773
And said i don't want to do this
any more, and they're watching

26:09.907 --> 26:12.509
You.
Like you're going to inspire

26:12.643 --> 26:14.311
Somebody to pick it back up and
do what they're supposed to do

26:14.445 --> 26:17.280
With their lives.
>> thank you.

26:17.415 --> 26:20.984
>> carson: And your coach, gwen.

26:21.118 --> 26:21.985
Feel like this is my chance,
right?

>> carson: Yes, ma'am.
>> i just want to say that,

26:25.656 --> 26:28.458
First of all, i know you are
just so incredible, because the

26:28.593 --> 26:30.360
Problem with you is that you are
going to make real records after

26:30.494 --> 26:33.997
This.
You're going to have the voice

26:34.131 --> 26:34.998
That people recognize on the
radio.

26:35.132 --> 26:41.538
[ cheers and applause ]
where you're the real thing.

26:41.672 --> 26:43.173
I'm so proud of you.
For the win!

26:43.307 --> 26:45.542

27:14.605 --> 27:17.007

seconds.

27:17.141 --> 27:20.343
>> coach, how feeling tonight?
>> break up in a small town.

27:20.478 --> 27:27.150

holy night ¶

29:09.687 --> 29:20.897

29:21.031 --> 29:33.443
Radiant beams
from thy holy face ¶

29:33.577 --> 29:40.583
¶ with the dawn of
redeeming grace

29:40.718 --> 29:54.664
Christ

Baber, everybody.
Nice job, barrett.

30:48.385 --> 30:53.990
Pharrell, we're going to start
with you.

30:54.124 --> 30:58.061
>> carson: Putting the child to
sleep over there.

30:58.195 --> 31:00.096
>> it's getting tough to -- i
don't know, to describe what it

31:00.231 --> 31:04.334
Is that you guys are doing.
Because all of you guys are like

31:04.468 --> 31:08.605
So incredibly talented.
But i will say that, you know,

31:08.739 --> 31:16.346
Your whole life story, you know,
it just -- it comes out every

31:16.480 --> 31:19.148
Time you sing.
And that's an amazing ability

31:19.283 --> 31:21.150
You have, man.
You touch people every time you

31:21.285 --> 31:25.421
Sing.
Because you sing your story.

31:25.556 --> 31:26.789
And that's next level.
Congratulations.

31:26.924 --> 31:31.160
[ cheers and applause ]
>> the thing that i appreciate

31:31.295 --> 31:33.863
About you, and that's a good
example, "silent night."

31:33.998 --> 31:37.100
Everything you perform, you put
your own spin on it.

31:37.234 --> 31:39.535
So there's nobody else out there
like you, man.

31:39.670 --> 31:41.905
And that's probably the thing
that's going to be the reason

31:42.039 --> 31:44.574
That you go on and you make it
in country music after this.

31:44.708 --> 31:47.710
Because there is nobody else on
the radio that sounds anything

31:47.845 --> 31:49.479
Like you, man.
Congratulations again.

31:49.613 --> 31:53.149

barrett baber.

And when you kiss
your little baby

33:48.766 --> 33:59.609
You've kissed ¶
¶ the face of god?

Would one day ¶

Did you know

can.

record, man.

[ cheers and applause ]
>> carson: Thank you, pharrell.

36:18.949 --> 36:21.217
Adam, i know it might be hard to
come up with comments.

36:21.351 --> 36:22.318
But what did you think?
>> right?

36:22.452 --> 36:23.986
>> what's that?
>> yeah, right.

36:24.121 --> 36:26.689
That's right.
I have so much -- i only have

36:26.823 --> 36:29.458
Things to say to this guy,
because things keep coming up at

36:29.593 --> 36:31.327
Last second.
How could i possibly have

36:31.461 --> 36:34.030
Anything left.
But one thing i just want to

36:34.164 --> 36:36.632
Tell you guys, a little story.
This song, which i had never

36:36.767 --> 36:40.803
Heard before in my life, which
is so beautiful.

36:40.938 --> 36:42.004
Is -- it was a last-minute
change.

36:42.139 --> 36:43.940
It was not my idea.
It was his idea.

36:44.074 --> 36:45.841
I had another idea.
Not much time.

36:45.976 --> 36:48.578
Please stop it.
With a last-minute change.

36:48.712 --> 36:50.446
And that shows you, and it's
something different about this

36:50.581 --> 36:52.582
Guy.
This guy is an artist and he has

36:52.716 --> 36:55.551
A vision.
And i let it go, because it's

36:55.686 --> 36:59.288
His career.
It's his world.

36:59.423 --> 37:01.023
And i'm so happy that i did,
because mine wouldn't have been

37:01.158 --> 37:04.293
The right choice.
His was the right choice and i'm

37:04.428 --> 37:06.963
So overjoyed that you made it.
And i applaud you.

37:07.097 --> 37:10.266
[ cheers and applause ]

Let's take a look team blake and
emily ann roberts' performance.

37:42.299 --> 37:45.901
It was a burning house.
Enjoy that and we'll see you in

37:46.036 --> 37:46.269
A few minutes.

37:54.678 --> 37:56.245
¶
¶ i had a dream about

37:56.380 --> 38:01.951
A burning house
you were stuck inside

38:02.085 --> 38:07.056
I couldn't get you out ¶
¶ i laid beside you

38:07.190 --> 38:13.329
And pulled you close
and the two of us

38:13.463 --> 38:17.033
Went up in smoke ¶
¶ love isn't all

38:17.167 --> 38:21.570
That it seems
i did you wrong

38:21.705 --> 38:24.140
I'll stay here ¶
¶ with you

38:24.274 --> 38:28.110
Until this dream
is gone

38:28.245 --> 38:30.980
I've been ¶
¶ sleepwalking

38:31.114 --> 38:34.083
Been wandering
all night

38:34.217 --> 38:39.789
Trying to take what's ¶
¶ lost and broke

38:39.923 --> 38:46.896
And make it right
i've been sleepwalking

38:47.030 --> 38:53.436
Too close to the fire ¶
¶ but it's the only place

38:53.570 --> 38:58.574
That i can hold you tight
in this burning house

38:58.709 --> 39:04.547
See you at a party ¶
¶ and you look the same

39:04.681 --> 39:10.786
I could take you back
but people don't ever change

39:10.921 --> 39:16.492
Wish that we could ¶
¶ go back in time

39:16.626 --> 39:24.166
I'd be the one you
thought you'd find

39:24.301 --> 39:27.303
Love isn't all ¶
¶ that it seems

39:27.437 --> 39:31.006

39:31.141 --> 39:36.679
Until this dream ¶
¶ is gone

39:36.813 --> 39:40.383
I've been
sleepwalking

39:40.517 --> 39:43.252
Too close to the fire ¶
¶ but it's the

39:43.387 --> 39:51.193
Only place
that i can hold you tight

39:51.328 --> 39:53.763
In this burning house ¶
¶ the flames are

39:53.897 --> 39:58.868
Getting bigger now
in this burning house

39:59.002 --> 40:04.840
I can hold on ¶
¶ to you somehow

40:04.975 --> 40:17.286
In this burning house
oh and i don't

40:17.421 --> 40:24.460
Wanna wake up ¶
¶ i been sleepwalking and

40:24.594 --> 40:29.465
Wandering all night ¶
¶ trying to take what's lost and

40:29.599 --> 40:35.538
Broken and make it right ¶
¶ i've been sleepwalking to hold

40:35.672 --> 40:42.511
To the fire ¶
¶ but it's the only place that i

40:42.646 --> 40:59.628

¶ in this burning house ¶
