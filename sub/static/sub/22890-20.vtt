not talked to her all day.

09:36.066 --> 09:39.333
So I can literally just tell
you what I know.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.767
This morning, Jax came over
to Katie and Tom's

09:42.767 --> 09:44.700
and said he broke up
with Brittany.

09:44.700 --> 09:48.500
I can't believe it yet because
we'll see in three hours

09:48.500 --> 09:50.734
or tomorrow or three days.
- Oh, yeah.

09:50.734 --> 09:52.600
- 'Cause this is what he does.
- Oh, my God.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.767
- But the sh---iest thing was
is that they had sex

09:55.767 --> 09:58.233
before he broke up with her.

09:58.233 --> 10:00.600
- It's bad enough that he
cheated on Brittany,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.300
but he needs to get his last
bang in before he leaves her?

10:03.300 --> 10:08.166
Jax is such a dirty little
piece of sh--.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.700
I'm glad you're more calm.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.734
- Well, you know,
I get a little fired up.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.767
Like, everybody's stories
seem to be, like,

10:13.767 --> 10:15.600
it's a little bit different.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.233
- Dude, there were cushions
by the hot tub, and like--

10:18.233 --> 10:20.467
- Yeah, so it's like a hot tub,

10:20.467 --> 10:23.266
like, outside of Jax's room,
and there were cushions

10:23.266 --> 10:25.000
by there.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
- How does anyone else have
a story when no one else

10:26.600 --> 10:28.600
was there but James
and I and Schwarz?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
- You didn't go on the balcony
with him at all.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.266
You didn't--you don't know
why the pillow's there?

10:32.266 --> 10:33.467
You didn't go swimming,
you didn't do nothing?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.100
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.100
That--No.
I'm honest with you.

in positions like that.

You should not, either.

10:48.367 --> 10:51.600

never put myself in a situation

10:51.600 --> 10:53.667

my relationship with him.

inside he knows

10:57.233 --> 10:58.600

not true.

Yes.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.400
Hi, Lisa.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.200
- Why haven't you got
your makeup on?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.400
- 'Cause I've been rehearsing
all day.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.734
I'm nervous and just trying
to get everything

27:29.734 --> 27:34.000

like, making me not look

27:34.000 --> 27:36.066
like I look right now.

27:36.066 --> 27:39.600
- You're gonna look beautiful.
Is your boyfriend coming?

27:39.600 --> 27:41.667
- Maybe, maybe not.

27:41.667 --> 27:43.200
- Well, he should be there.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
He should be there
to support you.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.533
- We'll see.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.367
- Don't be so secretive,
silly.

27:47.367 --> 27:49.300

like, one of Lala's, like,

27:49.300 --> 27:51.166
biggest performances, you know?

27:51.166 --> 27:53.433
And for her man to just, like,
you know, like, say he's too

27:53.433 --> 27:58.100
busy, you know,
I just kind of find that odd.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.166
'Cause I know I'd be there
for my girlfriend if she had

28:00.166 --> 28:02.166
a debut performance,
that's all I'm saying.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.433

drop it to the floor,

28:04.433 --> 28:07.533

and just step out of it.

28:07.533 --> 28:10.500
I love that.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.433
I'll send you a video.
