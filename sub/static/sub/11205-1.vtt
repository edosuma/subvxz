01:48.951 --> 01:53.263
You've just heard some words and music
written by Rodgers and Hart.

01:53.322 --> 01:57.134
This is the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
sound stage number one.

01:57.193 --> 02:00.333
In this film, Mickey Rooney
will portray Larry Hart,

02:00.396 --> 02:03.707
or Lorenz Hart, as the song sheets read,

02:03.766 --> 02:05.973
and I am Richard Rodgers.

02:07.403 --> 02:12.352
If in telling you about Larry
I talk quite a bit about myself,

02:12.408 --> 02:15.355
it's because there hasn't been
a day in my life

02:15.411 --> 02:18.620
that didn't have something
to do with Larry Hart.

02:18.681 --> 02:21.355
I'm almost sorry to say

02:21.417 --> 02:26.457
there were none of the standard trials
and tribulations you'd ordinarily expect.

02:27.556 --> 02:31.800
In fact, we were just two lucky fellows
who had success very young.

02:31.861 --> 02:34.364
From a dramatic standpoint,

02:34.430 --> 02:37.968
we didn't even have the advantage
of being very poor.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.241
We weren't very rich, either.

02:41.570 --> 02:43.447
When I first met Larry,

02:43.506 --> 02:48.785
he had already acquired quite a reputation
at Columbia University as a poet and wit,

02:48.844 --> 02:51.051
and I was a little scared.

02:51.113 --> 02:54.560
Anyhow, one day Herb Fields,
a mutual friend of ours

02:54.617 --> 02:57.427
who later wrote the books
for some of our shows,

02:57.486 --> 02:59.022
<i>arranged a meeting.</i>

02:59.088 --> 03:00.567
- Is this it?
- Yep.

03:00.623 --> 03:02.034
Maybe we ought to come back
some other time.

03:02.091 --> 03:03.627
- Oh, relax, will you?
- Yeah. But you think...

03:03.693 --> 03:05.468
Look, you wanna do a show with him,
don't you?

03:05.528 --> 03:06.666
- Oh sure, sure.
- All right, then.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.300
Meet him,
play a couple of songs and you're in.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.243
- Hi, Herb.
- Hi, Larry.

03:12.301 --> 03:13.507
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.843
Larry, I'd like
to have you meet Dick Rodgers.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.110
You know,
the fellow I was telling you about.

03:16.172 --> 03:17.276
Oh, hiya, Dick.

03:17.339 --> 03:19.444
Heard a lot about you.
You're the fellow who writes music, eh?

03:19.508 --> 03:21.613
- Well, I...
- Come on in. Make yourself at home.

03:21.677 --> 03:24.283
You hungry? Want something to eat?
How about some nuts?

03:24.346 --> 03:25.757
- Oh, no. Thanks.
- Apples? Oranges?

03:25.815 --> 03:26.850
- How about a piece of coffee cake?
- No...

03:26.916 --> 03:28.987
Corned beef sandwich? I'll send out,
get a corned beef sandwich.

03:29.051 --> 03:30.689
- No, thanks very much, anyway.
- Smoke? Cigar?

03:30.753 --> 03:32.061
- Light ones? Dark ones?
- I never use them.

03:32.121 --> 03:35.398
How about you, Herb? That's right.
You don't smoke, do you?

03:41.430 --> 03:42.738
<i>Go ahead.</i>

03:49.472 --> 03:51.008
Play something.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.754
<i>Go ahead.</i>

04:27.409 --> 04:30.015
Hey, hey, Herb, I got a new rhyme for you.
What rhymes with Coolidge?

04:30.079 --> 04:31.149
- Coolidge?
- Yeah.

04:31.213 --> 04:33.693
- Nothing rhymes with Coolidge.
- You wanna bet?

04:33.749 --> 04:35.387
- Coolidge?
- Sure, say it over to yourself.

04:35.451 --> 04:37.362
Coolidge, Coolidge, Coolidge.
Come on, quick.

04:37.419 --> 04:38.625
Oh, I'm ashamed of you.

04:38.687 --> 04:41.133
When you speak of Coolidge,
he deserves a eulogy.

04:41.190 --> 04:43.033
Coolidge he, eulogy.

04:43.459 --> 04:44.870
Hey, that's very good, Larry.

04:44.927 --> 04:46.531
That's all.

04:46.595 --> 04:48.165
Herb, did you read this article yet?

04:48.230 --> 04:50.608
- No, I didn't.
- It's not bad at all.

05:30.472 --> 05:33.112
Operator, give me Trafalgar 4599, please.

05:36.345 --> 05:40.919
Hello, Jack? This is Larry Hart.
Have you got that book of Heine's in yet?

05:40.983 --> 05:44.260
No, no, no. Not the translation.
That was the later edition.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.527
Yeah, will you look around please?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.627
Hey, that's not bad at all.

05:50.659 --> 05:54.971
Hello? You have? Jack, you're a doll.

05:55.030 --> 05:57.032
Yeah, yeah, right away. Yeah.

05:57.099 --> 06:00.376
What does he do now?
Shoot himself out of a cannon?

06:03.939 --> 06:06.215
Say, that's a pretty elaborate
musical phrase, isn't it?

06:06.275 --> 06:08.118
- Well, it's a...
- Not that it bothers me, you understand.

06:08.177 --> 06:11.454
I gotta go pick up a book.
I'll talk to you later, Herb.

06:11.513 --> 06:13.151
Go ahead. Keep playing.

06:16.018 --> 06:17.395
He liked it.

06:17.853 --> 06:20.697
Oh, sure, I could tell he liked it.
He did everything but card tricks.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.633
- Now, Dick...
- No, brother, I've seen everything.

06:22.691 --> 06:25.467
Here I sit at this piano,
and this nutcracker...

06:25.527 --> 06:27.268
But, Dick, he's always like that.

06:27.329 --> 06:29.673
- Mrs. Hart. How are you?
- Hello, Herb.

06:29.732 --> 06:31.837
Well, introduce me to this nice young man.

06:31.901 --> 06:35.144
- This is Dick Rodgers.
- I'm very happy to meet you, Mrs. Hart.

06:35.204 --> 06:38.344
- That was you playing the songs?
- Yes.

06:38.407 --> 06:41.581
- You wrote them?
- Well, sure. He's a real composer.

06:41.644 --> 06:43.851
Isn't that nice?

06:43.913 --> 06:45.290
You know something?

06:45.347 --> 06:49.489
I like your songs
and your playing, very much.

06:49.551 --> 06:52.031
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hart.

06:52.087 --> 06:54.727
Here, what am I standing here for?
Have a bite.

06:57.993 --> 07:01.406
<i>For quite a while, I didn't hear from Larry
and it began to look as though</i>

07:01.463 --> 07:05.775
<i>neither my tunes nor I
had scored much of a hit with Mr. Hart.</i>

07:05.834 --> 07:07.404
<i>I stuck with it.</i>

07:07.469 --> 07:11.246
<i>But, believe me, a tune without a lyric
is a mighty lonesome thing.</i>

07:16.612 --> 07:17.784
Hello.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.084
Oh, hello, Herb.

07:20.516 --> 07:21.688
Yeah?

07:22.151 --> 07:24.427
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, you heard me.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.956
- He's crazy about the songs.
- Yeah, he's crazy all right.

07:28.023 --> 07:31.163
No, no, not just crazy.
He's crazy about the music.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.206
I haven't heard from him in two weeks.

07:33.262 --> 07:34.935
- He wrote a lyric.
- A lyric?

07:34.997 --> 07:37.409
A lyric. You know, words.

07:38.334 --> 07:41.144
<i>Be there at 5:30 sharp.
And don't be late, please.</i>

07:41.203 --> 07:42.705
<i>Okay, fine. Goodbye.</i>

07:46.442 --> 07:48.752
<i>5:30 came, 5:30 went.</i>

07:48.811 --> 07:50.256
<i>And I got my first introduction</i>

07:50.312 --> 07:52.952
<i>to something I soon learned
I could count on,</i>

07:53.015 --> 07:55.825
<i>the business of waiting for Larry.</i>

07:55.884 --> 07:58.455
- Now don't worry. He'll be here.
- So he's crazy about it, huh?

07:58.520 --> 08:02.400
I tell you, the guy called me and
he was jumping through the telephone.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.300
Hi, Herb.

08:09.631 --> 08:11.577
Morn! Morn! Mary!

08:12.368 --> 08:14.348
Herb, have you seen
the September issue of <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

08:14.403 --> 08:15.905
- The what?
- No, I can tell you haven't seen it.

08:15.971 --> 08:17.143
- What is it, dear?
- Mom, have you seen

08:17.206 --> 08:18.583
<i>the September issue of Vanity Fair?</i>

08:18.640 --> 08:20.210
- No, I haven't.
- Mary, what have you done with it?

08:20.275 --> 08:21.845
You know I don't
read that stuff, Mr. Larry.

08:21.910 --> 08:23.787
Can we find it, please? Can we find it?

08:23.846 --> 08:26.520
It's getting so you can't find anything
in this house anymore.

08:26.582 --> 08:28.289
- Hi, Dick.
- Hi, Larry.

08:28.350 --> 08:29.988
Play that first thing for me, will you?

08:30.052 --> 08:33.465
- What thing?
- You know.

08:33.522 --> 08:34.967
- Hey, I got a new rhyme for you.
- Yeah?

08:35.024 --> 08:36.230
Yeah, what rhymes with tapestry?

08:36.291 --> 08:38.861
- Tapestry?
- Half-past three. Please.

08:39.428 --> 08:40.907
I found it in your room, Mr. Larry.

08:40.962 --> 08:42.874
Oh, good. Boy, you're wonderful.
You're a doll.

08:42.931 --> 08:45.207
- Listen, get me something to eat, will you?
- It's near suppertime.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.543
There's some knockwurst and salami
in the packages there.

08:47.603 --> 08:49.105
Cut some up, please.

08:49.838 --> 08:52.079
Here we are. Here we are.

08:55.044 --> 08:56.853
That's it. There you are.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.188
<i>Manhattan.</i>

09:01.250 --> 09:03.856
- You like Manhattan?
- Manhattan? Yeah, yeah, I like Manhattan.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.330
<i>Manhattan.</i>

09:05.988 --> 09:07.626
<i>We've got Manhattan</i>

09:07.689 --> 09:11.296
<i>The Bronx and Staten Island, too</i>

09:11.360 --> 09:17.367
<i>It's lovely going through the zoo</i>

09:17.733 --> 09:20.145
You know the rest. Go ahead. Play it, Dick.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.840
<i>Summer journeys to Niagara</i>

09:24.907 --> 09:28.480
<i>And to other places
aggravate all our cares</i>

09:28.544 --> 09:30.888
<i>We'll save our fares</i>

09:30.946 --> 09:35.122
<i>I've a cozy little flat in what
is known as old Manhattan</i>

09:35.184 --> 09:38.222
<i>We'll settle down</i>

09:38.287 --> 09:41.666
<i>Right here in town</i>

09:42.691 --> 09:44.637
<i>We'll have Manhattan</i>

09:44.693 --> 09:48.436
<i>The Bronx and Staten Island, too</i>

09:48.497 --> 09:55.073
<i>It's lovely going through the zoo</i>

09:57.506 --> 10:03.218
<i>It's very fancy
on old Delancey Street, you know</i>

10:03.278 --> 10:07.021
<i>The subway charms us so</i>

10:07.082 --> 10:12.464
<i>When balmy breezes blow to and fro</i>

10:12.521 --> 10:18.233
<i>And tell me what street
compares with Matt Street in July</i>

10:18.293 --> 10:25.040
<i>Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by</i>

10:25.901 --> 10:30.577
<i>The great big city's a wondrous toy</i>

10:30.639 --> 10:35.816
<i>Just made for a girl and boy</i>

10:35.878 --> 10:38.518
<i>We'll turn Manhattan</i>

10:38.580 --> 10:42.790
<i>Into an isle of joy</i>

10:49.191 --> 10:54.402
<i>I'd like to take a sail
on Jamaica Bay with you</i>

10:54.463 --> 11:01.381
<i>And fair Canarsie's lakes we'll view</i>

11:01.436 --> 11:08.217
<i>The city's clamor can never spoil</i>

11:08.277 --> 11:14.523
<i>The dreams of a boy and girl</i>

11:15.717 --> 11:19.290
<i>We'll turn Manhattan</i>

11:19.354 --> 11:25.566
<i>Into an isle of joy</i>

11:26.895 --> 11:30.172
Well, it's nice,
but a bit off the beaten track. I'm sorry.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.839
<i>But when you're riding the crest of youth,</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:35.939
<i>you don't get easily upset,
even by turndowns.</i>

11:36.004 --> 11:40.214
<i>Larry, in particular, was tireless,
and his enthusiasm was boundless.</i>

11:40.475 --> 11:45.185
<i>This kind of netter-sireiter writing, singing,
demonstrating went on for two years.</i>

11:45.447 --> 11:47.256
<i>But nothing happened.</i>

11:47.316 --> 11:50.820
<i>They aH thought the songs
were fresh, different, engaging,</i>

11:50.886 --> 11:52.456
<i>but nobody bought them.</i>

11:52.521 --> 11:54.762
<i>And after a while, this gets monotonous.</i>

11:54.823 --> 11:57.099
<i>After two years, it can get desperate.</i>

11:57.893 --> 12:01.033
<i>Finally, when I felt
I couldn't take it any longer,</i>

12:01.096 --> 12:03.042
<i>I had a talk with my father.</i>

12:05.234 --> 12:07.043
Can I help, Richard?

12:07.903 --> 12:11.009
What would you say if I told you
I were giving up being a composer?

12:11.073 --> 12:13.576
I'd say all right,
if I could think of a good reason,

12:13.642 --> 12:15.417
but just offhand I can't think of one.

12:15.477 --> 12:18.424
Well, I'll give you one. Nothing happens.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.051
Two years, almost three and I'm nowhere.

12:21.116 --> 12:24.962
- Where do you want to be?
- What's the sense of kidding, Pop?

12:25.020 --> 12:27.057
You've been carrying the freight too long.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.625
College, Academy of Music, and now this.

12:29.691 --> 12:32.137
Months and months
of knocking our brains out.

12:32.194 --> 12:33.571
Nobody cares.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.802
I think you've written many good things.

12:35.864 --> 12:39.277
Sure, and they can't even get me
a cup of coffee.

12:39.334 --> 12:41.473
Well, Richard, the coffee will come.

12:41.536 --> 12:44.176
Maybe you have to boil it a little more.

12:44.239 --> 12:48.813
- No, it's no good. I'm going into business.
- Business? Doing what?

12:48.877 --> 12:50.754
Selling infants' wear.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.520
How did you happen to
select this vocation?

12:53.582 --> 12:56.620
Well, a friend of mine
offered me $50 a week to start.

12:56.685 --> 12:57.891
Well!

12:57.953 --> 13:01.765
I never knew you were so interested
in getting $50 a week.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.828
- Do you need $50?
- What I need is self-respect.

13:05.894 --> 13:07.931
Well, you sound desperate.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.977
Gee, Pop. It's not only living off you.

13:11.033 --> 13:13.570
But I'm getting so
I'm envious of everyone.

13:13.635 --> 13:17.412
A counterman,
a taxi driver, a shoe shiner.

13:17.472 --> 13:19.611
Anybody who can earn anything.

13:19.675 --> 13:23.521
Richard, I went through
four years of college,

13:23.578 --> 13:26.559
two years of med school,
interned for two more years.

13:26.615 --> 13:28.185
And just about that time,

13:28.250 --> 13:31.561
I was in the same place
as any kid leaving grammar school,

13:31.620 --> 13:35.124
except I had a slight added handicap.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.568
I was also in love with your mother.

13:37.626 --> 13:42.302
Sol can only tell you, Son,
just keep writing those nice songs.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.775
Work with Larry.

13:43.832 --> 13:46.813
Dream a little longer,
and work a little harder.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.347
Be a little patient.

13:49.638 --> 13:53.142
No, it's no good, Pop.
I've made up my mind.

13:53.208 --> 13:58.055
Well, nothing better for a man than to
finally know exactly what he wants to do.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.862
So, I guess that's the way it's gotta be.

14:02.918 --> 14:04.864
Hope you don't think
I'm running out on you, Larry.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.297
Don't be silly.

14:06.355 --> 14:08.892
Of course, it is quite a switch
from musical comedy,

14:08.957 --> 14:11.403
but I think the diaper business
is a good business.

14:11.460 --> 14:13.462
Want something to eat?
Something to drink? Cigar?

14:13.528 --> 14:16.475
- No, thanks.
- That's right, you don't smoke, do you?

14:16.531 --> 14:18.704
Let's have a party. Want to have a party?

14:18.767 --> 14:21.611
It's an occasion. Might wind up
the greatest party we ever had.

14:21.670 --> 14:24.412
A farewell party.
Farewell to the maestro of music

14:24.473 --> 14:26.885
and a welcome
to the mogul of baby clothes, huh?

14:35.350 --> 14:37.193
Come on, now.

14:38.687 --> 14:40.826
Look out. Hot coffee.
Hot coffee coming through.

14:40.889 --> 14:43.028
Harry, how about you? A little coffee, boy?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.468
That's right. Just fresh made.

14:44.526 --> 14:46.802
- Hey, Larry, how about some more coffee?
- It'll stunt your growth.

14:46.862 --> 14:49.240
No, I'm sorry.
In that corner you get no coffee.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.970
- Good evening, Mr. Eddie.
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

14:51.032 --> 14:52.477
- Fine.
- Miss Grant. Miss McNeil.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.514
- Hello, Mary.
- Good evening. May I take your wraps?

14:54.569 --> 14:58.176
- Hey, a party.
- Now, Mr. Eddie.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.117
- Hey, Eddie. Hi!
- Hi, everybody. Hi!

15:00.175 --> 15:02.746
- Hey, hi, baby. Where you been?
- Auditioning.

15:02.811 --> 15:06.588
- Tough year for singers, you know.
- It's a tough year. Period.

15:06.648 --> 15:10.790
Or maybe not. Will you have some coffee?

15:10.852 --> 15:12.957
- Thanks.
- Let's assume this is for you.

15:13.021 --> 15:15.058
Look, this is my house.
Don't I get to meet the...

15:15.123 --> 15:19.697
Oh, sure, sure.
Everybody gets to meet everybody.

15:19.761 --> 15:23.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet two protégées of mine,

15:23.198 --> 15:26.805
Miss Margo Grant and Miss Peggy McNeil.

15:28.570 --> 15:31.073
Say, Herb,
you know Eddie Anders, of course?

15:31.139 --> 15:33.415
Of course. May I say
there's no one I'd rather hear sing?

15:33.475 --> 15:36.422
- Well, how about a song now, huh, kid?
- Oh, not now. Later maybe.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.890
What I really want
is for you to hear this one.

15:38.947 --> 15:41.621
She sings, too? What are we waiting for?

15:41.683 --> 15:44.289
Gee, let me catch my breath.
A little later maybe.

15:44.352 --> 15:46.423
What is this,
singers want to sing a little later, maybe?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.729
Come here, honey. I want to talk to you.

15:48.790 --> 15:52.328
- You're a singer, too?
- Well, not exactly. I dance.

15:52.394 --> 15:53.873
Yes, of course.

15:53.929 --> 15:56.375
May I say
there's no one I'd rather dance with?

15:57.265 --> 16:00.178
- Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.
-"Ah-ah, ah-ah," what?

16:00.235 --> 16:02.044
This one is for the boy.

16:05.440 --> 16:09.388
- Tell me all about yourself.
- Well, there's really not much to tell.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.254
That's a wonderful song.

16:13.315 --> 16:14.726
I'm glad you like it.

16:14.783 --> 16:18.128
I had no idea it was that good
when we wrote it.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.962
- Oh, are you...
- Larry Hart. Yeah, I wrote the words.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.262
Really?

16:23.558 --> 16:27.734
- Do you sing for a living?
- Kind of. I work in a café.

16:28.296 --> 16:30.298
It's really a Speakeasy.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.642
- Have you been here long?
- No. I'm hot out of Boston.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.205
- Have you ever been in a show?
- A couple.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.410
Why? Are you looking for someone
for a show?

16:38.473 --> 16:41.545
Because if you are,
they call me "Available" McNeil.

16:41.610 --> 16:43.749
No, honey. We're looking for a producer.

16:43.812 --> 16:45.587
- You know any?
- Producers?

16:45.647 --> 16:47.320
- What are they?
- Yeah.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.363
I never got past the elevator boy.

16:50.418 --> 16:54.560
Well, if either one of us
ever find a producer to produce our show,

16:54.623 --> 16:56.500
I'll bet you'd be wonderful in it.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.504
<i>You mean me?</i>

16:58.560 --> 17:00.938
I'll bet you'd be the best thing in it.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.680
- Shall we dance?
- Yeah. Sure. Come on.

17:12.173 --> 17:16.315
So you're a little fellow, aren't you?
But on you, it's very becoming.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.819
That's another song
from our un-produced show.

17:22.884 --> 17:24.227
I know and I love it.

17:24.286 --> 17:26.425
- You do?
- Eddie taught it to me.

17:26.488 --> 17:28.126
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:28.890 --> 17:30.767
Excuse me just a minute,
will you, honey, please?

17:30.825 --> 17:33.533
Thank you. Pardon me, Dick. Everybody.

17:34.396 --> 17:36.637
From the un-produced works
of Rodgers and Hart,

17:36.698 --> 17:39.008
Miss Peggy McNeil is going to sing
an unknown song entitled

17:39.067 --> 17:40.410
<i>There's A Small Hotel.</i>

17:40.468 --> 17:42.641
Miss McNeil, Mr. Rodgers.
Mr. Rodgers, Miss McNeil.

17:42.704 --> 17:45.617
- How do you do?
- I hope you all like it. You're on, honey.

17:49.277 --> 17:54.056
<i>There's a small hotel</i>

17:54.115 --> 17:58.222
<i>With a wishing well</i>

17:58.286 --> 18:03.235
<i>I wish that we were there</i>

18:03.291 --> 18:06.500
<i>Together</i>

18:08.797 --> 18:13.507
<i>There's a bridal suite</i>

18:13.568 --> 18:18.244
<i>One room bright and neat</i>

18:18.306 --> 18:22.721
<i>Complete far us ta share</i>

18:22.777 --> 18:26.486
<i>Together</i>

18:28.249 --> 18:31.856
<i>Looking through the window</i>

18:31.920 --> 18:37.336
<i>You can see a distant steeple</i>

18:38.460 --> 18:42.135
<i>Not a sign of people</i>

18:43.098 --> 18:46.841
<i>Who wants people?</i>

18:48.103 --> 18:52.848
<i>When the steeple bell</i>

18:52.907 --> 18:57.913
<i>Says, "Good night, sleep well"</i>

18:57.979 --> 19:01.756
<i>We'll thank the small hotel</i>

19:01.816 --> 19:06.890
<i>We'll creep into our little shell</i>

19:06.955 --> 19:12.906
<i>And we will thank the small hotel</i>

19:13.695 --> 19:19.646
<i>Together</i>

19:21.569 --> 19:23.276
- How about that, Herb?
- Oh, that was great.

19:23.338 --> 19:25.784
You really got something here, Eddie.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.287
- You do sing awful good, Peggy.
- It's an awful good song.

19:29.344 --> 19:32.154
There's another one.
We've got a million of them.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.749
And I'll bet you could sing them all.

19:33.815 --> 19:37.058
Wouldn't it get kind of monotonous,
me singing all those songs?

19:37.118 --> 19:39.564
No, honey, not to me it wouldn't.

19:41.956 --> 19:45.563
Peggy, how tall are you?

19:45.627 --> 19:48.233
I don't know. About 5'4", I guess.

19:48.296 --> 19:49.900
That's what I figured.

19:58.139 --> 19:59.641
There we are.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.753
- What is this?
- I'm filing you away for future reference.

20:03.812 --> 20:06.691
This is Dick, he's 6',
this is Herb, this is my mother.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.661
This is a little girl named Helen
and this is the milkman.

20:09.718 --> 20:11.288
I don't think I quite understand.

20:11.352 --> 20:13.389
You will, after you've known me
10 or 15 years.

20:13.455 --> 20:16.231
Larry! Larry! Larry! Dick!

20:16.291 --> 20:18.464
Look, you know what happened?
It's the darnedest thing.

20:18.526 --> 20:20.972
Look. Dick! Dick! Mr. Kay just phoned.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.872
- Mr. who?
- Mr. Kay.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.377
- The Theatre Guild. They want us.
- Who wants us?

20:25.433 --> 20:27.242
The Theatre Guild.
They want us to do a show.

20:27.302 --> 20:29.179
- The Garrick Gaieties.
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

20:29.237 --> 20:31.683
The kids are putting on
some kind of a benefit to buy tapestries

20:31.740 --> 20:34.277
- for the Guild's new theater.
- But, Dick, it's the Theatre Guild.

20:34.342 --> 20:37.482
- But it's only another benefit.
- Well, can't we talk it over, anyway, huh?

20:37.545 --> 20:40.025
Watch me change the mogul
of baby clothes back into a musician.

20:40.081 --> 20:42.152
Wanna bet? Come on. Come on.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.089
<i>And darned if he didn't.</i>

20:44.152 --> 20:48.794
<i>So there it was in big, bright lights,
The Garrick Gaieties.</i>

21:02.237 --> 21:05.707
<i>On the first of May</i>

21:05.774 --> 21:09.085
<i>It is moving day</i>

21:09.144 --> 21:12.523
<i>Spring is here so blow your job</i>

21:12.580 --> 21:16.118
<i>Throw your job away</i>

21:16.184 --> 21:19.961
<i>Now's the time to trust</i>

21:20.021 --> 21:24.128
<i>To your Wanderlust</i>

21:24.192 --> 21:28.368
<i>In the city's dust you wait</i>

21:28.429 --> 21:31.308
<i>Must you wait?</i>

21:31.366 --> 21:35.007
<i>Just you wait</i>

21:35.069 --> 21:37.743
<i>In a mountain greenery</i>

21:37.806 --> 21:40.980
<i>Where God paints the scenery</i>

21:41.042 --> 21:45.491
<i>Just two crazy people together</i>

21:45.547 --> 21:47.754
<i>While you love your lover</i>

21:47.816 --> 21:51.263
<i>Let blue skies be your coverlet</i>

21:51.319 --> 21:54.630
<i>When it rains, we don't mind the weather</i>

21:54.689 --> 21:57.169
<i>And if you're good</i>

21:57.225 --> 21:59.899
<i>I'll search for wood</i>

21:59.961 --> 22:02.407
<i>$0 you can cook</i>

22:02.463 --> 22:05.740
<i>While I stand looking</i>

22:05.800 --> 22:10.909
<i>Beans could get no keener reception
in a beanery</i>

22:10.972 --> 22:17.048
<i>Bless our mountain greenery home</i>

22:24.719 --> 22:26.790
<i>When the world was young</i>

22:26.855 --> 22:29.233
<i>Old Father Adam with sin would grapple</i>

22:29.290 --> 22:31.497
<i>So we're entitled to just one apple</i>

22:31.559 --> 22:33.698
<i>I mean, to make apple sauce</i>

22:34.629 --> 22:36.734
<i>Underneath the bough</i>

22:36.798 --> 22:39.278
<i>We'll learn a lesson from Mister Omar</i>

22:39.334 --> 22:41.507
<i>Beneath the eyes of no Pa and no Ma</i>

22:41.569 --> 22:43.378
<i>Old Lady Nature is boss</i>

22:43.438 --> 22:45.975
<i>And if you're good</i>

22:46.040 --> 22:48.384
<i>I'll search for wood</i>

22:48.443 --> 22:50.787
<i>$0 you can cook</i>

22:50.845 --> 22:54.054
<i>While I stand looking</i>

22:54.115 --> 22:58.894
<i>Beans could get no keener reception
in a beanery</i>

22:58.953 --> 23:03.368
<i>Bless our mountain greenery home</i>

23:49.504 --> 23:51.541
<i>Simple cooking means</i>

23:51.606 --> 23:53.711
<i>More than French cuisines</i>

23:53.775 --> 23:58.417
<i>I've a banquet planned
which is sandwiches and beans</i>

23:58.479 --> 24:00.720
<i>Coffee's just as grand</i>

24:00.782 --> 24:02.728
<i>With a little sand</i>

24:02.784 --> 24:05.731
<i>Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy</i>

24:07.355 --> 24:10.393
<i>Shatter, boy?</i>

24:10.458 --> 24:13.996
<i>Attaboy</i>

24:22.770 --> 24:24.647
<i>In a mountain greenery</i>

24:24.706 --> 24:26.743
<i>Where God paints the scenery</i>

24:26.808 --> 24:30.688
<i>Just two crazy people together</i>

24:30.745 --> 24:32.952
<i>How we love sequestering</i>

24:33.014 --> 24:35.119
<i>Where no pests are pestering</i>

24:35.183 --> 24:38.460
<i>No dear Mama holds us in tether</i>

24:38.519 --> 24:42.661
<i>Mosquitoes here won't bite you, dear</i>

24:42.724 --> 24:47.639
<i>I'll let them sting me on the finger</i>

24:47.695 --> 24:51.905
<i>We could find no cleaner retreat
from life's machinery</i>

24:51.966 --> 24:54.037
<i>Than our mountain greenery home</i>

24:54.102 --> 24:56.048
<i>Down with city slickings</i>

24:56.104 --> 24:58.209
<i>Up with cows and chickens</i>

24:58.272 --> 25:00.343
<i>Down with noise and clutter</i>

25:00.408 --> 25:02.479
<i>Up with milk and butter</i>

25:02.543 --> 25:05.353
<i>Down with life's machinery</i>

25:05.413 --> 25:10.863
<i>Bless our mountain greenery</i>

25:10.918 --> 25:17.335
<i>home!</i>

25:35.410 --> 25:37.822
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Mr. Hart. Here's your morning papers.

25:37.879 --> 25:39.449
- Three of each.
- Yeah. How much do I owe you?

25:39.514 --> 25:41.653
- That'll be 24 cents for the works.
- 24 cents?

25:41.716 --> 25:44.697
24 cents I haven't got, but here's a buck.
Buy yourself a railroad.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.993
- Gee, thanks!
- That's all right, Eddie.

25:47.055 --> 25:49.934
Hey, Morn! Morn!

25:49.991 --> 25:52.767
- The papers are here.
- Coffee is ready, Lorry.

25:52.827 --> 25:55.000
Just a minute, will you, darling?
Just a minute.

25:55.063 --> 25:56.838
Here it is, here it is.

25:56.898 --> 25:59.003
"Last night a group
of the younger Theatre Guild actors

25:59.067 --> 26:01.673
"came up with a little hand-built revue
called The Garrick Gaieties.

26:01.736 --> 26:03.841
"And to my utter amazement,
I found it jammed throughout

26:03.905 --> 26:08.285
"with talented young people, bright tunes,
sparkling lyrics and smart sketches."

26:08.342 --> 26:11.585
- Mom, we're in. We're a hit.
- But naturally, Lorry.

26:11.646 --> 26:13.182
I'll get that.

26:17.985 --> 26:19.987
- Good morning, Richard.
- Hello, darling.

26:20.054 --> 26:21.158
Have you heard the good news?

26:21.222 --> 26:23.964
- We're a hit. We're in.
- But of course.

26:24.025 --> 26:25.299
And if the Theatre Guild has any notions

26:25.359 --> 26:28.465
about this little show running for just a
few performances, they'd better forget it.

26:28.529 --> 26:29.599
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:29.664 --> 26:30.734
- Uh-oh.
-"Uh-oh," what?

26:30.798 --> 26:32.243
-"The music."
- What about the music?

26:32.300 --> 26:34.906
"The music," it says here,
"is fresh and melodic and engaging,

26:34.969 --> 26:37.745
"and these qualities are bound to carry
composer Richard Rodgers to the top

26:37.805 --> 26:39.182
"in years to come.

26:39.240 --> 26:43.052
"Meanwhile, by the way,
just who is Mr. Richard Rodgers?"

26:43.111 --> 26:45.352
Mr. Richard Rodgers
is the young gentleman

26:45.413 --> 26:47.017
who is making my coffee get cold.

26:47.081 --> 26:48.424
Now just a minute, Mrs. Hart.

26:48.483 --> 26:51.327
I want to prove to you
that Larry isn't so famous, either.

26:51.385 --> 26:52.830
-"The lyrics."
- What about the lyrics?

26:52.887 --> 26:55.697
"The lyrics are bright, witty and adult
and in good taste.

26:55.756 --> 26:57.360
"In short, they are excellent.

26:57.425 --> 27:01.100
"And it is a pleasure to greet a new writer
as gifted as he is unknown,

27:01.162 --> 27:03.108
"Mr. Lorenz Hart."

27:03.164 --> 27:05.371
- Mr. Hart.
- Mr. Rodgers.

27:05.433 --> 27:06.878
I'll get it.

27:10.204 --> 27:11.444
- Hiya, Morn.
- Hello, Eddie.

27:11.506 --> 27:14.851
Have you seen the notices?
They're terrific. Morn, we're a smash.

27:14.909 --> 27:16.650
- But certainly.
- Hi, Dick. Hi, Larry.

27:16.711 --> 27:19.055
Have you seen what's in the papers
here about Herbie Fields?

27:19.113 --> 27:20.956
- No. What does it say?
- Oh, boy, it says right here,

27:21.015 --> 27:23.222
"The original sketches were concocted

27:23.284 --> 27:26.231
"by a young man nobody ever heard of,
Herbert Fields.

27:26.287 --> 27:30.326
"Outstanding in a smart cast
was singer Eddie Anders who will be..."

27:30.391 --> 27:32.894
- Eddie Anders? Hey, that's me!
- Congratulations.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.270
- You're in, Eddie!
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

27:38.633 --> 27:39.941
Good morning, Herb.

27:40.001 --> 27:41.981
Oh, you bet it's a good morning.
Have you heard the news?

27:42.036 --> 27:44.539
- Sure. We are smash.
- Yes, that's right. We are.

27:44.605 --> 27:45.948
- Hi, fellows.
- Hi, Herbie.

27:46.007 --> 27:47.042
Have you read these write-ups?

27:47.108 --> 27:48.451
- They're the most sensational...
- Yeah, I read them.

27:48.509 --> 27:49.852
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

27:49.911 --> 27:51.447
- Everything's fine.
- What is it? What is it?

27:51.512 --> 27:53.082
James Kelly.
He wants to produce a show.

27:53.147 --> 27:55.058
- What? Kelly?
- Yes, I was up all night with him.

27:55.116 --> 27:57.460
He saw the Gaieties last night
and he wants to do a show with us.

27:57.518 --> 27:59.327
- On Broadway?
- Not in Bridgeport!

27:59.387 --> 28:00.866
- That's great.
- What are we waiting for?

28:00.922 --> 28:02.595
Mom, cook some breakfast,
will you, please?

28:02.657 --> 28:04.659
Mary. Mary, honey,
cook some breakfast, too.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.102
We'll start right away. 3:00 sharp.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.367
<i>We've already got My Funny Valentine
and You're Nearer.</i>

28:08.429 --> 28:09.840
- What time is it?
- 9:30.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.240
9:30. I've got to make a phone call.

28:11.299 --> 28:12.972
Talk to yourselves, will you?

28:15.102 --> 28:17.605
Hello. Give me Trafalgar 2098, please.

28:21.209 --> 28:22.279
Hello.

28:22.343 --> 28:25.415
<i>Hello. Hello. Is this my blue-eyed friend
from Boston?</i>

28:25.479 --> 28:27.823
This is your red-eyed friend from Boston.

28:27.882 --> 28:30.692
- Who is it?
- This is Larry. Larry Hart, yeah.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.731
Now, look, don't get excited.
Don't even wake up.

28:32.787 --> 28:34.824
You're dreaming this, only it's true.

28:34.889 --> 28:36.926
<i>We sold our musical comedy.</i>

28:36.991 --> 28:41.030
Gee, Larry, that's marvelous,
really and truly.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.234
You're going to be in it, hear me?

28:44.432 --> 28:46.036
<i>I'll see you at the club tonight.</i>

28:46.100 --> 28:48.080
And I'm gonna bring
Herb and Dick with me.

28:49.770 --> 28:53.343
And aside from that,
I don't know anything new.

28:53.407 --> 28:55.216
Thank you, Larry.

28:55.276 --> 28:58.257
Larry, I'd like to measure you right now.

28:58.312 --> 29:01.691
I'll bet you're really taller. I know I am.

29:02.016 --> 29:10.016
<i>Goodbye.</i>

29:27.508 --> 29:30.921
There you are, sir,
and if I do say so myself, they look fine.

29:33.681 --> 29:36.161
- They look all right, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.

29:36.217 --> 29:37.355
Get up.

29:40.421 --> 29:41.866
Go ahead, walk.

29:43.257 --> 29:46.136
One, two, three, four.

29:46.193 --> 29:50.505
One, two, three, four,
turn, two, three, four.

29:52.266 --> 29:57.511
They feel fine, but I feel
as if I were walking downhill, you know?

29:57.571 --> 29:59.073
Well, naturally.

30:01.175 --> 30:04.019
- What about the trousers?
- Oh, yes. You see, I forgot to tell you.

30:04.078 --> 30:06.251
When the lifts move you up,

30:06.314 --> 30:09.227
the trousers, shall we say,
move up proportionately.

30:10.184 --> 30:13.427
- However, with a slight adjustment...
- Slight adjustment?

30:17.291 --> 30:19.771
You're completely defeating your purpose.

30:21.295 --> 30:24.105
Well, they feel very comfortable,

30:24.165 --> 30:26.543
- but I get a little... In the back of it.
- Oh, yes.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.137
For a while, you'll notice a slight
tenseness in those back muscles.

30:29.203 --> 30:32.082
However, after a while,
that too will adjust itself.

30:32.139 --> 30:34.016
- Look all right?
- Oh, excellent, sir.

30:34.075 --> 30:36.351
Oh, I must warn you.
When you take your shoes off at night,

30:36.410 --> 30:39.823
if you notice a slight popping of the ears,
don't let it alarm you.

30:44.985 --> 30:47.727
- 3:00 sharp, huh?
- Well, you know Larry.

30:47.788 --> 30:50.098
Here it is 5:15, he's not here yet.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.252
Hiya, baby. Hiya, kid.

31:10.444 --> 31:13.186
Notice anything different? Look, you guys.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.555
- Haircut?
- No.

31:14.615 --> 31:16.526
- Shave?
- No. Well?

31:16.584 --> 31:19.258
- Well, what?
- Well, what? The shoes. Look.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.628
- The shoes?
- Certainly. The shoes.

31:20.688 --> 31:21.860
2" taller. How about that?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.094
- Taller?
- Sure.

31:23.157 --> 31:24.795
- Are you serious?
- Certainly. 2".

31:24.859 --> 31:26.861
No kidding. Built up on the inside.
You can't even see it.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.873
You ought to get some sometime.
Anybody call?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.602
Peggy-
- Yeah?

31:30.664 --> 31:32.666
Say, we've got to go over to the club
and see her tonight.

31:32.733 --> 31:34.576
And is she excited about doing the show.

31:34.635 --> 31:36.342
- What show?
- What show?

31:36.404 --> 31:38.782
Why, our new show, of course.

31:38.839 --> 31:40.682
Why? Does she want to be in the chorus?

31:40.741 --> 31:43.153
Chorus? Why, she's going to do the part.

31:43.844 --> 31:45.517
You both like her, don't you?

31:45.579 --> 31:48.389
Oh, sure, but, Larry,
this isn't The Garrick Gaieties.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.986
- Did you ever hear of Joyce Harmon?
- Yeah. Certainly.

31:51.051 --> 31:53.122
Well, Mr. Kelly's got her signed
to a personal contract.

31:53.187 --> 31:54.928
That's one of the main reasons
he's doing our show,

31:54.989 --> 31:56.525
because she's right for it.

32:00.327 --> 32:02.273
Why, Joyce Harmon's
the greatest thing you've ever seen.

32:02.329 --> 32:04.366
Yeah, I know. But you said that she was...

32:04.432 --> 32:06.503
Look, Larry, we're not producing the show.

32:06.567 --> 32:08.843
A man investing that much money
in a couple of new authors,

32:08.903 --> 32:11.747
he wants some protection.
You can understand that.

32:13.107 --> 32:16.111
Yeah. I can understand that.

32:17.244 --> 32:20.020
<i>Oh, the wild herd gathers
where the moon is full</i>

32:20.080 --> 32:22.720
<i>There's not much buffalo but lots of bull</i>

32:22.783 --> 32:24.228
<i>Way out West</i>

32:24.985 --> 32:27.522
<i>In the wild, wild West</i>

32:27.588 --> 32:30.865
<i>Away out West on West End Avenue</i>

32:30.925 --> 32:33.269
<i>Yippee-ay-yay! You!</i>

32:39.533 --> 32:42.275
Well, tell me all about it.

32:43.304 --> 32:45.250
- Drinks are on me tonight.
- Oh.

32:45.306 --> 32:46.546
25% off.

32:50.778 --> 32:52.689
Well, herds to our show.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.884
- Peggy...
- What's wrong, Larry?

32:55.950 --> 32:58.123
Nothing the matter with the show?

32:58.185 --> 33:01.064
After I talked to you this morning,
I talked to Dick and Herb,

33:01.121 --> 33:04.625
and it seems as though the producer
has Joyce Harmon under contract and...

33:04.692 --> 33:07.070
- She's going to do the part.
- Yeah.

33:07.561 --> 33:09.404
I'm awfully sorry, Peggy.

33:09.463 --> 33:12.740
It's going to take all the boot
out of doing this show, for me, anyway.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.110
Don't worry. It's not so bad.

33:16.270 --> 33:19.080
I got a call this afternoon
from the Shubert office.

33:19.139 --> 33:22.143
They want me to go on the road
with some operetta.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.986
It's not the greatest part in the world,
but the money's pretty good

33:26.046 --> 33:28.424
and I guess I could use the experience.

33:29.850 --> 33:33.525
Peggy, this isn't the time,

33:33.587 --> 33:36.727
but ever since I saw you...

33:36.790 --> 33:38.269
Larry, please.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.072
We're both a little off-balance now,
and we both have many things to do.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.112
I know I have.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.513
Well, I went on record, anyway.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.880
Let's drink some of this before it gets flat.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.023
<i>That was the touch-off spark</i>

34:01.081 --> 34:03.493
<i>that was to affect
everything Larry Hart ever did again.</i>

34:05.085 --> 34:06.564
<i>But, frankly, I was more concerned</i>

34:06.620 --> 34:11.228
<i>with our new musical comedy
and our new leading lady.</i>

34:45.525 --> 34:48.473
<i>Fortune never smiles, but in my case</i>

34:48.529 --> 34:51.998
<i>It just laughs right in my face</i>

34:52.600 --> 34:55.978
<i>If} looked for a horseshoe, I suppose</i>

34:56.036 --> 35:01.076
<i>It would bop me right in the nose</i>

35:01.141 --> 35:04.213
<i>My luck will vary surely</i>

35:04.278 --> 35:09.023
<i>That's purely a curse</i>

35:09.083 --> 35:11.063
<i>My luck has changed</i>

35:11.118 --> 35:16.727
<i>It's gotten from rotten</i>

35:16.790 --> 35:19.532
<i>to worse</i>

35:21.128 --> 35:25.702
<i>Where's that rainbow you hear about?</i>

35:25.766 --> 35:30.112
<i>Where's that lining they cheer about?</i>

35:30.170 --> 35:36.951
<i>Where's that love nest
where love is king ever after?</i>

35:38.779 --> 35:43.159
<i>Where's that blue room they sing about?</i>

35:43.217 --> 35:47.688
<i>Where's that sunshine they fling about?</i>

35:47.755 --> 35:51.202
<i>I know morning will come</i>

35:51.258 --> 35:55.206
<i>But pardon my laughter</i>

35:56.163 --> 36:00.703
<i>In each scenario
you can depend on the end</i>

36:00.768 --> 36:04.306
<i>Where the lovers agree</i>

36:04.371 --> 36:06.373
<i>Where's that Lothario?</i>

36:06.440 --> 36:09.080
<i>Where does he roam?</i>

36:09.143 --> 36:15.924
<i>With his dame Vaseline-d as can be</i>

36:16.717 --> 36:21.393
<i>It is easy to see all right</i>

36:21.455 --> 36:26.131
<i>Everything's gonna be all right</i>

36:26.193 --> 36:32.974
<i>Be just dandy for everybody</i>

36:33.033 --> 36:36.606
<i>but me</i>

36:43.711 --> 36:45.657
<i>It is easy to see all right</i>

36:45.713 --> 36:47.818
<i>Everything's gonna be all right</i>

36:47.881 --> 36:51.795
<i>Be just dandy for everybody but me</i>

37:30.958 --> 37:35.031
<i>It is easy to see all right</i>

37:35.095 --> 37:40.704
<i>Everything's gonna be all right</i>

37:40.768 --> 37:47.117
<i>Be just dandy for everybody</i>

37:47.174 --> 37:48.778
<i>and me</i>

37:48.842 --> 37:51.049
<i>- Got that blue room
- To sing about</i>

37:51.111 --> 37:53.057
<i>- Sun is shining
- To fling about</i>

37:53.113 --> 37:55.389
<i>- Got that love nest
- You hear about</i>

37:55.449 --> 37:57.520
<i>- A silver lining
- To cheer about</i>

37:57.584 --> 38:01.259
<i>You can have that rainbow</i>

38:01.321 --> 38:06.930
<i>'Cause we got that rainbow</i>

38:06.994 --> 38:13.843
<i>now</i>

38:31.451 --> 38:33.294
- Who is it?
- It's me.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.855
Oh, come in.

38:35.589 --> 38:37.091
I ran back before the crowd got in.

38:37.157 --> 38:39.501
- Well, how was it?
- You were only sensational.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.301
Thank you, Dick, for everything.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.568
The flowers, your help,
the way you conducted.

38:43.630 --> 38:44.973
You're welcome.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.739
Joyce, would you like to go out tonight?

38:47.801 --> 38:50.748
- Have a drink maybe?
- Oh, Dick, I'm sorry.

38:50.804 --> 38:52.408
But you know me, opening night.

38:52.472 --> 38:54.884
I'm going right home,
get a hamburger and crawl into bed.

38:54.942 --> 38:57.252
- Give me a rain check, will you?
- Sure.

38:57.311 --> 39:00.315
- How about tomorrow? It's Sunday.
- Oh, that's right.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.486
I tell you what, come over around 4:00
and I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.621
4:00? I'll be there.

39:07.221 --> 39:09.030
More flowers.

39:09.089 --> 39:11.000
Dick, they're perfectly beautiful.

39:11.058 --> 39:12.537
Thank you again.

39:13.627 --> 39:14.833
There.

39:15.462 --> 39:18.671
- Well, sit down.
- Thanks.

39:23.303 --> 39:25.408
I hate Saturday night openings, don't you?

39:25.472 --> 39:26.576
Yeah.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.588
Waiting till Monday for the notices
is kind of like a Chinese execution.

39:36.350 --> 39:38.455
Is something troubling you, Dick?

39:39.686 --> 39:40.858
Look, Joyce,

39:42.222 --> 39:46.136
I can't say this the way I want to,
so I'll just say it plain.

39:46.927 --> 39:48.235
I'm in love with you.

39:48.295 --> 39:51.742
And I've been in love with you a long time
and I don't know what to do about it.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.106
Do you...

39:54.134 --> 39:57.172
- Are you serious?
- I'd like to marry you.

39:58.238 --> 40:00.946
Well, I guess that's all there is to it.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.813
Dick, come here.

40:07.547 --> 40:11.723
I can't tell you how sweet that was,
your telling me just that way.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.527
You're one of the nicest persons
I've ever known.

40:14.588 --> 40:17.660
But nice as it is to hear,
it just doesn't make sense.

40:17.724 --> 40:20.432
But why does it have to make sense?

40:20.494 --> 40:23.634
Because being in love
is more than just saying it,

40:23.697 --> 40:26.678
or wanting to be, or thinking you are.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.735
And your being in love with me
is impossible.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.544
- Believe me, it is.
- Why?

40:31.605 --> 40:33.983
Well, mathematics.

40:34.041 --> 40:36.351
I'm 33, you're 23.

40:36.410 --> 40:38.219
What difference does that make?

40:38.278 --> 40:41.282
Dick, when a woman's 33,

40:41.348 --> 40:44.522
a day's a difference, a week's a difference,
a month's a difference.

40:44.584 --> 40:46.996
Ten years, that's a century.

40:50.357 --> 40:53.361
Well, I guess that's that.

40:55.095 --> 40:58.599
How would you like your tea?
With or without sugar?

40:58.665 --> 41:00.474
Two lumps are fine for me.

41:02.502 --> 41:05.506
<i>Sugar or no,
I was a very bitter young man.</i>

41:05.572 --> 41:09.042
<i>The girl of my dreams didn't love me
and all the world was sad and dreary.</i>

41:09.443 --> 41:10.979
<i>In black despair, I decided to do</i>

41:11.044 --> 41:13.251
<i>what every young fellow
with a broken heart does.</i>

41:13.680 --> 41:16.092
<i>I decided to go to the movies.</i>

41:16.149 --> 41:18.925
<i>But I was in no mood to be alone
and so in search of company,</i>

41:18.986 --> 41:21.227
<i>I dropped in on an old friend,</i>

41:21.288 --> 41:22.460
<i>Ben Feiner.</i>

41:24.424 --> 41:27.564
- Hello, Dorothy. Is Ben home?
- No, but come in.

41:27.627 --> 41:28.799
Thanks.

41:30.397 --> 41:32.468
I'm sorry. Ben went out.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.604
Say, when did you get so big?

41:35.669 --> 41:37.979
Oh, I don't know. Just lately, I guess.

41:38.038 --> 41:41.144
Well, I thought maybe Ben would like
to see a movie or something.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.382
- Well, I don't know when he'll be back.
- It doesn't matter.

41:44.444 --> 41:46.651
You've been away at school, haven't you?

41:46.713 --> 41:48.954
- Came in to see your show last night.
- Really?

41:49.016 --> 41:50.757
- Liked it very much.
- Thank you.

41:50.817 --> 41:53.263
- I've seen all your shows.
- Both of them?

41:54.988 --> 41:57.298
Excuse me. Won't you sit down?

41:57.357 --> 42:00.236
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?

42:00.293 --> 42:03.206
No, thank you. I had my tea today.

42:03.263 --> 42:05.539
- How are the folks?
- Fine. They'll be in soon.

42:05.599 --> 42:08.079
Well, I guess I'll go to the movie myself.

42:08.135 --> 42:09.773
They say it's a good picture.

42:09.836 --> 42:13.978
- Camille. Have you seen it?
- No, I haven't, but I'm going to.

42:14.041 --> 42:16.988
- Well, tell Ben to call me.
- All right.

42:17.844 --> 42:20.654
Oh, say, Dorothy, you wouldn't like
to see the movie with me?

42:20.714 --> 42:23.854
- Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid not.
- Why not?

42:23.917 --> 42:25.794
Well, you see, I...

42:25.852 --> 42:29.390
Well, I never go out with older men.

42:29.456 --> 42:31.732
- With what?
- You know what I mean.

42:31.792 --> 42:35.205
- All of Ben's friends are kind of...
- Kind of old men, huh?

42:35.262 --> 42:37.003
Well, I'm sure you understand.

42:37.064 --> 42:40.705
Oh, certainly. I understand perfectly.

42:41.201 --> 42:42.339
Good night.

42:44.938 --> 42:48.886
<i>That was really Black Sunday for me.
Shut out twice.</i>

42:48.942 --> 42:53.254
<i>Once because I was too young,
and once because I was too old.</i>

42:53.313 --> 42:57.989
<i>I pictured myself tragically wandering
around the globe for the rest of my days.</i>

42:58.652 --> 43:02.657
<i>And in my grief I was certainly
in the right frame of mind to see Camille.</i>

43:26.947 --> 43:29.860
<i>But I'd clean forgotten
that there was a big stage show,</i>

43:29.916 --> 43:32.089
<i>all built around one of our numbers.</i>

43:46.967 --> 43:50.471
<i>Remember the youth amid snow and ice</i>

43:50.537 --> 43:54.246
<i>Who bore the banner
with the strange device</i>

43:54.307 --> 43:57.914
<i>"Excelsior"</i>

43:57.978 --> 44:01.516
<i>This motto applies to those who dwell</i>

44:01.581 --> 44:05.393
<i>In Richmond Hill or New Rochelle</i>

44:05.452 --> 44:11.664
<i>In Chelsea or in Sutton Place</i>

44:13.093 --> 44:16.802
<i>You've got to reach the heights</i>

44:16.863 --> 44:21.972
<i>To win the race</i>

44:22.035 --> 44:24.982
<i>See the pretty apple, top of the tree</i>

44:25.038 --> 44:28.076
<i>The higher up, the sweeter it grows</i>

44:28.141 --> 44:31.088
<i>Picking fruit you've got to be</i>

44:31.144 --> 44:33.988
<i>Up on your toes</i>

44:34.047 --> 44:36.618
<i>See the pretty penthouse, top of the roof</i>

44:36.683 --> 44:39.994
<i>The higher up, the higher rent goes</i>

44:40.053 --> 44:42.556
<i>Get that dough, don't be a goof</i>

44:42.622 --> 44:44.863
<i>Up on your toes</i>

44:44.925 --> 44:47.633
<i>They climb the clouds</i>

44:47.694 --> 44:50.607
<i>To come through with air mail</i>

44:50.664 --> 44:53.406
<i>The dancing crowds</i>

44:53.466 --> 44:55.912
<i>Look up to some rare male</i>

44:55.969 --> 44:57.471
<i>Like that Astaire male</i>

44:57.537 --> 45:00.040
<i>See the pretty ladies, top of the crop</i>

45:00.106 --> 45:03.315
<i>You wanna know the way the wind blows?</i>

45:03.376 --> 45:06.084
<i>Then, my boy, you'd better hop</i>

45:06.146 --> 45:08.353
<i>Up on your toes</i>

45:08.415 --> 45:14.297
<i>Up on your toes</i>

48:31.584 --> 48:34.428
<i>That day I was very much alone.</i>

48:34.487 --> 48:36.626
<i>Larry was away seeing Peggy, and I hoped</i>

48:36.689 --> 48:40.000
<i>things were going a lot better for him
than they had for me.</i>

48:41.528 --> 48:44.008
Now you've really got me surrounded.

48:44.063 --> 48:47.010
A bolted door, a Rodgers and Hart song.

48:47.066 --> 48:48.943
What's the next twist to the plot?

48:49.002 --> 48:51.915
Well, that shouldn't be hard to guess.
It's the love scene.

48:51.971 --> 48:54.747
You know, where the fellow tells the girl
that she's like a Roman candle,

48:54.808 --> 48:58.722
a Greek chorus, an Italian gondola,
only here we are in Indianapolis.

48:58.778 --> 49:02.157
Then when he runs out of things to say,
instead of coming to the point,

49:02.215 --> 49:05.059
he reaches into his pocket
and hands her a prop.

49:08.488 --> 49:10.399
Go ahead. Try it on for size.

49:11.958 --> 49:13.335
Excuse me.

49:20.033 --> 49:22.570
What's the matter, Peggy?
Don't you want it?

49:22.669 --> 49:25.149
Sure, I want it. I want it very much.

49:26.339 --> 49:27.477
But I just can't.

49:27.540 --> 49:29.747
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute,
will you, Peg? This is Larry Hart.

49:29.809 --> 49:31.789
Remember me?
The fellow who wants to marry you.

49:31.845 --> 49:35.054
Larry, that's just the trouble.

49:35.114 --> 49:36.252
What?

49:37.116 --> 49:41.360
I love you too much to fool you,
but I don't love you enough to marry you.

49:42.388 --> 49:46.530
- A little too much but not quite enough.
- Please don't, Larry.

49:46.593 --> 49:50.564
Look, you're a big success,
you're talented, you're funny and nice,

49:50.663 --> 49:52.734
and there's so much else in life for you.

49:52.799 --> 49:55.405
None of that seems important to me now.

49:55.468 --> 49:59.041
I only wish you were the guy.
I hate hurting you.

49:59.105 --> 50:02.484
No, it's not your fault. It's mine.

50:02.542 --> 50:05.853
It always hurts when you find out
you've been kidding yourself.

50:05.912 --> 50:08.825
And deep down,
I always knew I really wasn't the guy.

50:08.882 --> 50:10.691
I wanted it to be you.

50:10.750 --> 50:12.388
- So much.
- I knew.

50:13.419 --> 50:16.889
For me, your heart doesn't pound,
your stars don't sing,

50:16.956 --> 50:19.869
and your world doesn't stop.
That's why I'm not the guy.

50:19.926 --> 50:21.599
- Larry, where you going?
- Who knows?

50:21.661 --> 50:24.073
The thing is to go and go fast.

51:20.086 --> 51:22.088
Lexington 5400.

51:24.490 --> 51:26.299
Hello, Dick?

51:26.359 --> 51:27.895
Lorry is home.

51:33.666 --> 51:35.771
- Hiya, Mr. Hart.
- Hiya, Dick.

51:35.835 --> 51:39.715
- Well, what do you say?
- Oh, I'm fine.

51:39.772 --> 51:42.412
Missed you. Where've you been?

51:42.475 --> 51:45.513
Oh, went to a couple of places
I always wanted to see.

51:46.746 --> 51:49.522
- Did you see them real good?
- Yeah.

51:49.582 --> 51:51.186
I saw them great.

51:51.250 --> 51:53.127
- How's the show doing?
- Selling out.

51:53.186 --> 51:55.666
Oh, that's fine. Anything else new?
What's new?

51:55.722 --> 51:58.464
Oh, nothing much.
Been fooling around with a tune or two.

51:58.524 --> 51:59.696
That's good.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.162
What's wrong, Larry?

52:03.563 --> 52:05.167
The usual thing.

52:05.231 --> 52:08.542
The love song is slowing up
the show a bit.

52:08.601 --> 52:10.012
- Anything I can do?
- No.

52:10.069 --> 52:12.413
No, everything's been done.

52:12.472 --> 52:14.952
No more love songs. That's all. No.

52:15.008 --> 52:18.319
Just those fast, bright things
from here on in, huh? Huh?

52:18.378 --> 52:19.686
Larry, I hate to see you like this.

52:19.746 --> 52:24.058
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost.
I didn't mean to get everybody in a storm.

52:24.117 --> 52:26.825
- It's all over.
- It's all over.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.457
<i>Finie la guerre</i>. The boat has sailed.

52:30.990 --> 52:33.300
It's all over. Well...

52:34.260 --> 52:35.933
What do we do next, huh?

52:35.995 --> 52:37.941
- Feel like working?
- Sure. Sure, anything.

52:37.997 --> 52:39.271
Make me an offer.

52:39.332 --> 52:41.107
- We got a wire from Cochran in London.
- Yeah?

52:41.167 --> 52:43.511
- He wants us to bring our show over.
- The Girl Friend?

52:43.569 --> 52:46.072
- That's right.
- Oh. Gosh.

52:46.139 --> 52:48.016
- Cochran, huh?
- Right away.

52:48.074 --> 52:50.782
Oh, good. Is it a good deal?

52:52.712 --> 52:55.420
- What do we think about it?
- I'm ready.

52:56.916 --> 52:58.862
I'm with you. When do we sail?

53:02.155 --> 53:04.965
"This London,
this hub of the British empire,

53:05.024 --> 53:07.231
"is a city of traditions and of history.

53:07.293 --> 53:10.331
"It's the city of Shakespeare.
It's the city of Chaucer."

53:10.396 --> 53:12.740
It's a city where you can't get
a hot dog or an ice-cream soda.

53:12.799 --> 53:14.176
Look, do you want
to listen to this or not?

53:14.233 --> 53:15.268
Of course we do.

53:15.334 --> 53:17.336
Don't pay any attention to him. Go on.

53:17.403 --> 53:20.043
Now. Now about Parliament. It says,

53:20.106 --> 53:22.586
"This impressive monument
to free institutions

53:22.642 --> 53:25.213
"covers 8 acres, has 1,100 rooms,

53:25.278 --> 53:27.554
"100 staircases and 2 miles of passages."

53:27.613 --> 53:30.025
I'm glad I don't have to clean it.

53:30.083 --> 53:32.825
"It's the mother of Parliaments
dedicated to the right of..."

53:32.885 --> 53:35.297
Holy smoke! That reminds me.
I forgot to write my mother.

53:35.354 --> 53:36.492
Come on, let's go, Eddie.

54:56.402 --> 55:00.248
<i>From all visitors and inquisitors</i>

55:01.073 --> 55:04.919

<i>A small room</i>

<i>A hall room</i>

Goodbye, peace and quiet.

<i>After all the dizzy excitement
of our first show abroad,</i>

58:52.538 --> 58:54.609
<i>the trip home was a letdown.</i>

58:54.673 --> 58:57.119
<i>And once again Larry became restless.</i>

59:02.248 --> 59:04.751
- Here you are.
- Hi.

59:04.817 --> 59:07.889
I just thought who would be great to play
the lead in <i>A Connecticut Yankee.</i>

59:07.953 --> 59:09.933
- Yeah, who?
Peggy-

59:09.989 --> 59:11.696
She's just right for it.

59:13.225 --> 59:16.468
- Do you really think so?
- Sure. Why don't you call her?

59:16.529 --> 59:19.703
Ship to shore. What are you waiting for?

59:22.468 --> 59:24.607
Hello! Hello!

59:26.205 --> 59:28.207
Well, aren't you excited?

59:28.707 --> 59:32.086
Oh. Well, tomorrow morning.

59:33.446 --> 59:35.392
I'll meet you at the dock.

59:35.448 --> 59:38.554
No, you'll have to be there. I won't listen.

59:39.251 --> 59:42.357
I'll see you tomorrow.
Now don't forget. Goodbye.

59:52.731 --> 59:54.267
- Well, hello, Brian.
- Hello.

59:54.333 --> 59:56.643
- Do you see her at all, Dick?
- Not yet.

59:57.436 --> 59:59.313
Hi, Dick! Dick Rodgers!

59:59.371 --> 01:00:00.907
- Hello, Ben.
- Hi, Larry.

01:00:00.973 --> 01:00:02.577
- Hi, Ben.
- Good to see you, boy.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:03.711
- You just get in?
- Yeah.

01:00:03.776 --> 01:00:05.278
Well, so did I. On the <i>Roma,</i> from Naples.

01:00:05.344 --> 01:00:07.051
Excuse me, will you, fellows?
I got to find somebody.

01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:11.027
- I didn't know you'd been in Europe.
- Yeah, yeah. In fact, the whole family.

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:12.323
- Mr. Feiner.
- Glad to see you.

01:00:12.384 --> 01:00:13.590
- Mrs. Feiner.
- So nice to see you.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.861
- Hello, Dick. How are you?
- Hello, Dorothy. I didn't recognize you.

01:00:16.922 --> 01:00:19.266
- Mr. Feiner, your baggage is ready, sir.
- Thank you.

01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:21.032
- We'll see you in customs, Dorothy.
- All right, fine, Ben.

01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:22.436
- See you later, Dick.
- So long, Ben.

01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:23.599
Goodbye, Dick.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.664
How would you like to go
to a movie with me sometime?

01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:28.473
Be glad to ask
my mother and father. Goodbye.

01:00:28.534 --> 01:00:30.878
Oh, I'm having a birthday party
in three weeks at Tarrytown.

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:32.142
Would you like to come?

01:00:32.204 --> 01:00:33.842
- How old?
- Eighteen.

01:00:33.906 --> 01:00:34.941
Gee, I don't know.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:37.214
Eighteen-year-old girls
are pretty old for me.

01:00:37.276 --> 01:00:40.155
But I'll be glad
to ask my mother and father.

01:00:40.212 --> 01:00:41.623
Well, I'll see you then.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:48.893
Telegram for Mr. Hart.
Telegram for Mr. Hart.

01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:49.989
Right here, fellow.

01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:51.329
- Mr. Lorenz Hart?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:52.801
Sign here, please.

01:00:55.661 --> 01:00:57.231
Oh, wait a minute. Here.

01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:00.143
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.817
<i>Dear Larry. Sorry I couldn't meet you.</i>

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:12.083
<i>Signed a contract for pictures.
Left for the coast this morning.</i>

01:01:12.144 --> 01:01:15.318
<i>Good luck with your new show.
Love, Peggy.</i>

01:01:40.639 --> 01:01:41.674
Oh, thank you.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.777
- Happy birthday, Sis.
- Ben.

01:01:44.877 --> 01:01:48.347
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd like to climb a tree.

01:01:48.414 --> 01:01:51.588
- Well, I don't happen to have one on me.
- Oh, but I do. Come on.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:54.824
So we're going to climb a tree, huh?
Any tree I know?

01:01:54.887 --> 01:01:57.333
Oh, you'll see. Follow me, monsieur.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:01.635
- What is this?
- My private tree.

01:02:01.694 --> 01:02:03.901
I spend half my life up here.

01:02:03.963 --> 01:02:06.705
In fact, it's where I spin my finest dreams.

01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:11.440
- Well.
- This is wonderful.

01:02:11.503 --> 01:02:13.983
And now, Mr. Rodgers,
I would like the story of your life.

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:15.177
At this altitude?

01:02:15.241 --> 01:02:17.346
You can skip your boyhood
and start at the part

01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:20.288
where you fell in love
with the leading lady, Joyce Harmon.

01:02:20.346 --> 01:02:23.020
- I see you've been reading my mail.
- Did she really break your heart?

01:02:23.082 --> 01:02:27.758
You bet. And I didn't get over it
for, oh, an hour and a half.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.697
Oh, that's not what I heard.

01:02:29.755 --> 01:02:31.063
What did you hear?

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.694
I heard that's why you went to London,
to forget her.

01:02:33.759 --> 01:02:36.433
I'm going to have plenty of trouble
with you.

01:02:36.495 --> 01:02:40.238
All right, I was in love with her.
And I did go to London to forget her.

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:42.802
But she's a very remarkable woman,

01:02:42.868 --> 01:02:46.611
and we both should be very grateful
to her because she saved me.

01:02:46.672 --> 01:02:49.482
- Saved you?
- She saved me for you.

01:02:50.676 --> 01:02:53.179
Gee, I never thought of that.

01:02:53.779 --> 01:02:56.350
Remind me to send her some flowers.

01:03:15.234 --> 01:03:17.407
We can't rehearse that other number
because we...

01:03:17.469 --> 01:03:20.746
- Any word from Larry?
- He'll show up. He always does.

01:03:22.975 --> 01:03:26.047
What do we do now?
We need extra lyrics for Thou Swell.

01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:28.881
I'd better go with them.

01:03:39.425 --> 01:03:40.699
Hi, Dick.

01:03:42.561 --> 01:03:43.631
Hi.

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:46.767
How's it going?

01:03:48.734 --> 01:03:51.408
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

01:03:52.838 --> 01:03:54.545
Let's take a walk.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.789
Well, where have you been?

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:07.660
I went out on the coast.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.963
- Oh, great. And?
- And nothing. She'd gone to Mexico.

01:04:11.023 --> 01:04:12.559
You mean you just went out there?

01:04:12.624 --> 01:04:15.571
I wired her first,
but she went to Mexico, anyway.

01:04:15.627 --> 01:04:18.801
- Well, I don't know what to tell you, Larry.
- There's nothing to tell.

01:04:18.864 --> 01:04:22.710
Oh, yes, there is, there's plenty.
And if I don't, who will?

01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:24.805
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, sure, you know.

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.851
But here we are in rehearsals,
the whole company waiting for the lyrics,

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:30.079
everybody going crazy and where are you?

01:04:30.142 --> 01:04:32.452
- I know.
- It's murder.

01:04:32.511 --> 01:04:35.788
You're murdering yourself,
your work, everybody.

01:04:35.848 --> 01:04:37.794
You've got to pull yourself together.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.660
You can't keep running around
the world chasing rainbows.

01:04:41.987 --> 01:04:46.094
- They're ready with that number, Dick.
- Okay, Tommy. I'll be right there.

01:04:46.158 --> 01:04:48.297
Dick. Dick!

01:05:56.395 --> 01:05:59.604
<i>Are not mine eyes fair to view?</i>

01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:02.646
<i>They're there to view thee</i>

01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:05.978
<i>Wilt not thine own dare to view</i>

01:06:06.038 --> 01:06:09.212
<i>What love canst be?</i>

01:06:09.274 --> 01:06:12.118
<i>Ah, see my color pale for thee</i>

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:15.920
<i>Hear my heart fail for thee, too</i>

01:06:15.981 --> 01:06:19.292
<i>I have a sweet tale for thee</i>

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:22.195
<i>'Tis sad but true</i>

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:29.438
<i>'Tis sad</i>

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:37.943
<i>but true</i>

01:06:43.909 --> 01:06:45.855
<i>Thy words are queer, sir</i>

01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:48.050
<i>Unto mine ear, sir</i>

01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:51.356
<i>Yet thou art a dear, sir, to me</i>

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:53.453
<i>Thou couldst woo me</i>

01:06:53.519 --> 01:06:56.125
<i>Now couldst thou try, knight</i>

01:06:58.624 --> 01:07:00.365
<i>I'd murmur swell, too</i>

01:07:00.425 --> 01:07:02.496
<i>And like it well, too</i>

01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:05.235
<i>More thou wilt tell to</i>

01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:08.073
<i>Sandy, thou art dandy</i>

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:10.511
<i>Now art thou my knight</i>

01:07:16.441 --> 01:07:18.648
<i>Thine arms are martial</i>

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:20.621
<i>Thou hast grace</i>

01:07:20.679 --> 01:07:24.991
<i>My cheek is partial to thy face</i>

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:29.089
<i>And if thy lips grow weary</i>

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:33.933
<i>Mine are their resting place</i>

01:07:38.997 --> 01:07:42.774
<i>Thou swell, thou witty</i>

01:07:42.834 --> 01:07:46.179
<i>Thou sweet, thou grand</i>

01:07:46.238 --> 01:07:49.447
<i>Wouldst kiss me pretty?</i>

01:07:49.508 --> 01:07:52.352
<i>Wouldst hold my hand?</i>

01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:55.221
<i>Both thine eyes are cute, too</i>

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.887
<i>What they do to me</i>

01:07:58.951 --> 01:08:00.589
<i>Hear me holler</i>

01:08:00.652 --> 01:08:05.897
<i>I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee</i>

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:09.337
<i>I'd feel so rich in</i>

01:08:09.394 --> 01:08:12.773
<i>a hut for two</i>

01:08:12.831 --> 01:08:16.073
<i>Two rooms and kitchen</i>

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.841
<i>I'm sure would do</i>

01:08:18.904 --> 01:08:21.885
<i>Give me just a plot of</i>

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:24.783
<i>Not a lot of land</i>

01:08:24.843 --> 01:08:27.618
<i>And thou swell</i>

01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:29.386
<i>Thou witty</i>

01:08:29.448 --> 01:08:31.359
<i>Thou grand</i>

01:10:10.882 --> 01:10:12.987
<i>Thou swell</i>

01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:14.587
<i>Thou witty</i>

01:10:14.653 --> 01:10:16.496
<i>Thou sweet</i>

01:10:16.555 --> 01:10:18.125
<i>Thou pretty</i>

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.828
<i>Thou terrific</i>

01:10:19.891 --> 01:10:21.529
<i>Thou sensational</i>

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:28.010
<i>Thou grand</i>

01:10:55.927 --> 01:10:59.534
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:05.548
<i>I behold your adorable face</i>

01:11:06.271 --> 01:11:10.549
<i>Just a song at the start</i>

01:11:11.443 --> 01:11:16.119
<i>But it soon was a hymn to your grace</i>

01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:20.686
<i>But I always knew</i>

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:26.931
<i>I would live life through</i>

01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:32.972
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:40.179
<i>for you</i>

01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:46.485
- Do you like it?
- It's lovely. Play it again, please.

01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:50.883
You know, that's the kind of a song

01:11:50.949 --> 01:11:53.156
that could solve
everyone's romantic problems.

01:11:53.218 --> 01:11:56.199
Now imagine two people in love,

01:11:56.288 --> 01:12:01.135
and the fellow is, you know,
one of those bashful types.

01:12:01.193 --> 01:12:03.833
All he has to do
is take her to hear this song.

01:12:03.895 --> 01:12:08.275
Wouldn't have to propose,
ask her father, nothing.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:10.847
I think I know what you mean.

01:12:10.902 --> 01:12:14.475
A song like this,
she might even end up marrying him.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.041
Couldn't she?

01:12:17.242 --> 01:12:19.722
But she'd have to know him
a little bit better first.

01:13:19.337 --> 01:13:23.183
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Lena Horne.</i>

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:36.297
<i>It seems we've stood and talked</i>

01:13:36.354 --> 01:13:41.963
<i>like this before</i>

01:13:42.027 --> 01:13:48.069
<i>We looked at each other
in the same way then</i>

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:51.342
<i>But I can't remember</i>

01:13:51.403 --> 01:13:56.978
<i>where or when</i>

01:14:00.578 --> 01:14:04.924
<i>The clothes you're wearing</i>

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:10.695
<i>are the clothes you wore</i>

01:14:10.755 --> 01:14:17.639
<i>The smile you are smiling
you were smiling then</i>

01:14:17.696 --> 01:14:20.643
<i>But I can't remember</i>

01:14:20.699 --> 01:14:27.275
<i>where or when</i>

01:14:29.374 --> 01:14:34.483
<i>Some things that happened</i>

01:14:34.546 --> 01:14:39.723
<i>for the first time</i>

01:14:41.219 --> 01:14:48.068
<i>Seem to be happening again</i>

01:14:52.998 --> 01:14:58.175
<i>And so it seems</i>

01:14:58.236 --> 01:15:03.777
<i>That we have met before</i>

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:11.120
<i>And laughed before</i>

01:15:11.182 --> 01:15:16.723
<i>And loved before</i>

01:15:16.788 --> 01:15:23.569
<i>But who knows where</i>

01:15:26.264 --> 01:15:31.680
<i>or when</i>

01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:44.455
Quite a coincidence that she happens
to be singing a Rodgers and Hart song.

01:15:44.516 --> 01:15:48.191
If you think that's a coincidence,
wait until you hear the next number.

01:15:56.394 --> 01:15:59.807
<i>I've wined and dined on Mulligan stew</i>

01:15:59.864 --> 01:16:02.140
<i>And never asked for turkey</i>

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.840
<i>As I hitched and hiked and grifted, too</i>

01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:07.747
<i>From Maine to Albuquerque</i>

01:16:07.806 --> 01:16:11.720
<i>Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball</i>

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:15.189
<i>And what is twice as sad</i>

01:16:15.246 --> 01:16:17.920
<i>I was never at a party</i>

01:16:17.982 --> 01:16:22.431
<i>Where they honored Noel Ca'ad</i>

01:16:22.487 --> 01:16:26.799
<i>But social circles spin too fast for me</i>

01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:33.104
<i>My hobohemia is the place to be</i>

01:16:35.033 --> 01:16:39.880
<i>I get too hungry for dinner at eight</i>

01:16:39.938 --> 01:16:44.751
<i>I like the theater, but never come late</i>

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:49.622
<i>I never bother with people I hate</i>

01:16:49.681 --> 01:16:53.026
<i>That's why the lady is a tramp</i>

01:16:54.552 --> 01:16:59.262
<i>I don't like crap games
with barons and earls</i>

01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:04.069
<i>Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls</i>

01:17:04.129 --> 01:17:08.874
<i>Don't dish the dirt
with the rest of the girls</i>

01:17:08.933 --> 01:17:12.506
<i>That's why the lady is a tramp</i>

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:18.452
<i>I like the free, fresh wind in my hair</i>

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:20.956
<i>Life without care</i>

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:23.253
<i>I'm broke, that's oke</i>

01:17:23.314 --> 01:17:24.987
<i>Hate California</i>

01:17:25.049 --> 01:17:27.996
<i>It's cold and it's damp</i>

01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:31.431
<i>That's why the lady is a tramp</i>

01:17:39.764 --> 01:17:44.406
<i>I go to Coney, the beach is divine</i>

01:17:44.469 --> 01:17:49.248
<i>I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine</i>

01:17:49.307 --> 01:17:53.983
<i>I get the columns and read every line</i>

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:57.424
<i>That's why the lady is a tramp</i>

01:17:58.783 --> 01:18:03.391
<i>I like a prizefight when it's not a fake</i>

01:18:03.454 --> 01:18:08.062
<i>I like the rowing on Central Park Lake</i>

01:18:08.126 --> 01:18:12.768
<i>I go to opera and stay wide awake</i>

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:16.277
<i>That's why the lady is a tramp</i>

01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:22.182
<i>I like the green grass under my shoes</i>

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.743
<i>What can I lose?</i>

01:18:24.809 --> 01:18:27.085
<i>I'm flat, that's that</i>

01:18:27.145 --> 01:18:31.958
<i>I'm all alone when I lower my lamp</i>

01:18:32.016 --> 01:18:35.987
<i>That's why the lady</i>

01:18:38.523 --> 01:18:45.338
<i>is a tramp</i>

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:07.024
Now's a good time.

01:19:07.085 --> 01:19:10.157
- For what?
- To ask a girl to marry someone.

01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:13.669
Are you sure
we're well enough acquainted?

01:19:13.725 --> 01:19:18.071
Well, it's hard to answer a question
like that unless you've just been kissed.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:28.882
We're well enough acquainted.

01:19:30.108 --> 01:19:33.282
Dick, how do you think
Larry's going to feel about us?

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:37.285
It's not going to be easy for him.

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:42.325
Here we are happy, in love,
going to be married,

01:19:42.387 --> 01:19:44.958
a whole bright future ahead of us.

01:19:45.023 --> 01:19:46.696
And what's he got?

01:19:46.758 --> 01:19:49.705
- Shall I try to talk to him?
- What would you say?

01:19:49.761 --> 01:19:51.604
Well, I don't know,

01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:55.042
I'm so lucky these days,
I might think of something.

01:19:55.099 --> 01:19:57.705
I'm awful glad
you talked me into marrying you.

01:19:57.769 --> 01:19:58.941
So am I.

01:20:07.779 --> 01:20:12.694
- Well, now, what's the big secret?
- Dick and I are going to be married.

01:20:13.484 --> 01:20:16.556
Married? That's wonderful!

01:20:19.157 --> 01:20:22.661
- She's going to be married.
- Congratulations. Very nice.

01:20:22.727 --> 01:20:25.901
Yes, married. That is wonderful.

01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:30.202
Dick and I have been together for so long,
the thought of him getting married,

01:20:30.268 --> 01:20:31.542
it's a little strange.

01:20:31.602 --> 01:20:33.946
But you're going to be very happy
because he's a wonderful guy.

01:20:34.005 --> 01:20:35.678
- So are you.
- Me?

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.880
I'm just a guy that writes lyrics,
runs away, hides, has a few laughs,

01:20:38.943 --> 01:20:42.755
- comes back and writes lyrics.
- Yes, I know.

01:20:43.281 --> 01:20:46.751
- And in between, you fall in love.
- We don't talk about that.

01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:48.525
Oh, yes, we do.

01:20:48.586 --> 01:20:52.193
Our being happy won't mean as much
if you're miserable.

01:20:52.256 --> 01:20:54.930
Miserable? Me? Why, I'm always happy.

01:20:54.992 --> 01:20:59.270
- No one's always happy.
- All right, so I'm slightly miserable.

01:21:00.098 --> 01:21:02.578
You're a woman,
so maybe you can tell me.

01:21:03.134 --> 01:21:06.308
Why couldn't she have loved me
just a little bit when I...

01:21:06.371 --> 01:21:08.009
When I loved her so much?

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:09.676
Maybe she loves you more than you think.

01:21:09.741 --> 01:21:11.721
No, no, it's not that.
There's something about me.

01:21:11.776 --> 01:21:14.655
When we'd get right up to the wire,
it would stop her.

01:21:14.712 --> 01:21:16.521
What is it? Am I that ugly?
Am I that repulsive?

01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:19.187
Oh, don't say that about yourself.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.059
How corny can I get?

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.197
Dick thinks that you and he ought
to go to the coast to do some pictures,

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:28.294
and he feels you don't want to.

01:21:28.359 --> 01:21:30.669
Would you like to give me
a real nice wedding present?

01:21:30.728 --> 01:21:32.264
Sure, anything, darling. What?

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:35.470
Well, after we're married,
we want you to come to California with us

01:21:35.533 --> 01:21:38.173
- on our honeymoon.
- On your honeymoon?

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:42.014
You've talked me into it.
Hollywood, here I come.

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:48.789
- So this is Hollywood.
- No. Beverly Hills.

01:21:48.846 --> 01:21:50.951
Beverly Hills Hotel on your left.

01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:58.425
Chinese Theatre.

01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.438
Well, there's nothing like
a house with a view.

01:22:08.499 --> 01:22:10.240
When do we start taking oxygen?

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:13.475
As I understand it,
you'll be here quite a while, Mr. Hart.

01:22:13.538 --> 01:22:15.108
Just you and your mother.

01:22:15.173 --> 01:22:17.175
And an occasional friend or two.

01:22:17.241 --> 01:22:22.452
Well, you'll need a nice, comfortable spot,
plenty of privacy, but not too ostentatious.

01:22:32.957 --> 01:22:34.595
This is it.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:36.605
- Nice cozy little place.
- Yeah.

01:22:39.063 --> 01:22:42.135
The place leases with or without the staff.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.841
Let's see, butler, houseman,
cook, pastry cook,

01:22:45.903 --> 01:22:48.747
downstairs maid, upstairs maid.

01:22:48.806 --> 01:22:51.548
- Where's the bell?
- Oh, right here, right here.

01:22:51.609 --> 01:22:55.250
Gardener, chauffeur, footman, watchman.

01:22:55.313 --> 01:22:56.883
I'm from the Hollywood Realty Company.

01:22:56.948 --> 01:22:58.894
- Oh, yes, of course. Come in, please.
- Thank you.

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.452
Thank you, sir, very much.

01:23:09.427 --> 01:23:10.963
Hello!

01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:15.873
One thing, a fellow
would never be lonesome in this place.

01:23:19.103 --> 01:23:22.550
- The study is there.
- That's the study.

01:23:23.241 --> 01:23:25.414
The music room is there

01:23:25.476 --> 01:23:28.457
and the dining room is there.

01:23:28.513 --> 01:23:31.653
The projection room is there.

01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:33.957
Miniature theater is there.

01:23:34.018 --> 01:23:36.362
And the billiard room is there.

01:23:37.288 --> 01:23:39.768
Who built this place,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer?

01:23:41.859 --> 01:23:44.305
This is the living room.

01:23:45.296 --> 01:23:47.333
Yes, it's very livable.

01:23:49.634 --> 01:23:51.545
Come and take a look outside.

01:23:57.842 --> 01:23:59.185
The patio.

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:03.758
The pool.

01:24:03.814 --> 01:24:05.350
Oh, yes, the pool.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:07.418
And look at that view.

01:24:08.719 --> 01:24:10.426
Pretty complete, I'd say.

01:24:10.488 --> 01:24:12.559
Yeah, but what good is it?

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:14.469
There's no airport.

01:24:15.693 --> 01:24:19.368
No, but there's room for one.
Well, Mr. Hart, what do you think?

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.172
What do I think?
I think it's sensational. I'll take it.

01:24:22.233 --> 01:24:23.610
- Well, that's fine.
- Yeah.

01:24:23.668 --> 01:24:28.048
Any resemblance between me and a fellow
in his right mind is purely coincidental.

01:24:33.644 --> 01:24:37.353
"Mr. and Mrs. Dick Rodgers,
Santa Fe Chief, en route Los Angeles.

01:24:37.415 --> 01:24:38.894
"Dear Dick. Come directly to my party.

01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.396
"Have rented the cutest little cabin
you ever saw.

01:24:41.452 --> 01:24:44.092
"Just tell driver top of Summit Road
in Hollywood Hills.

01:24:44.155 --> 01:24:47.261
"Black tie and a girl preferred.
Love and kisses, Larry."

01:24:47.325 --> 01:24:49.771
Well, that's what it says,
top of Summit Road.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.487
There's dancing in the patio, sir.

01:25:16.821 --> 01:25:19.165
Nothing like sneaking into town.

01:25:19.223 --> 01:25:20.566
Hey, Dick, Dick, boy!

01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:21.968
- Hiya, Larry.
- How are you?

01:25:22.026 --> 01:25:23.471
- Larry.
- Dorothy, honey.

01:25:23.527 --> 01:25:24.972
Hey, wait just a minute, pal. There you go.

01:25:25.029 --> 01:25:26.770
Hey, what do you think of all this, huh?

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:28.401
- Very intimate.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:25:28.466 --> 01:25:30.036
- What's the party for?
- What do you mean what's it for?

01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:31.375
Does there have to be a reason?
It's a party.

01:25:31.435 --> 01:25:33.437
Everybody in Hollywood is here.

01:25:33.504 --> 01:25:35.745
This looks like everybody
west of the Rockies is here.

01:25:35.806 --> 01:25:38.218
Well, you certainly proved that
a New Yorker can outdo Hollywood.

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:41.788
Come on. Mom's over here.
Or will you have a drink first?

01:25:41.846 --> 01:25:43.382
- No, thanks.
- How about it, Dorothy?

01:25:43.447 --> 01:25:45.586
<i>How about an hors d' oeuvre?
Here they are.</i>

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:48.790
Keep them going around, will you, fellow?
Here we go.

01:25:49.787 --> 01:25:51.391
Morn. Morn, look who's here.

01:25:51.455 --> 01:25:54.334
- Hello, Mrs. Hart.
- Dick and Dorothy.

01:25:54.392 --> 01:25:56.599
Oh, it is good to see you.

01:25:56.661 --> 01:25:59.665
- Oh, you look so nice.
- Why, thank you.

01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:02.040
Hey, there's Judy Garland. Hiya, Judy.

01:26:03.968 --> 01:26:05.413
Hi, Larry.

01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:09.545
Judy, you know my morn, of course.
And Dick and Dorothy Rodgers.

01:26:09.607 --> 01:26:11.143
- Hello, Judy.
- Sure, hello.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:13.950
- It's a wonderful party.
- I'm glad. But excuse me.

01:26:14.011 --> 01:26:15.684
I must keep the customers happy.

01:26:15.746 --> 01:26:17.419
- Are you coming, Larry?
- Coming, Mother.

01:26:17.481 --> 01:26:19.825
Oh, that's all I need. Fine.
Take care. I'll be right back.

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:21.625
- Always in action.
- Yeah.

01:26:21.686 --> 01:26:23.495
Say, when are we going to do
that show together, Judy?

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:26.194
Oh, we've been talking about
that show for so long,

01:26:26.257 --> 01:26:27.827
it's gotten to be a running gag.

01:26:27.892 --> 01:26:30.998
That's only because you're never
in New York long enough to sing a chorus.

01:26:31.062 --> 01:26:34.635
I know. But look,
we're all in Hollywood now.

01:26:34.699 --> 01:26:36.645
Is there any chance
of our doing a picture together?

01:26:36.701 --> 01:26:38.578
- Oh, Judy, I'd love to.
- Now, I know you've got a story

01:26:38.636 --> 01:26:39.876
'cause Larry told me so.

01:26:39.937 --> 01:26:41.780
And I bet you've got
some spare songs, too.

01:26:41.839 --> 01:26:45.981
- But, look, sweetie, you see, we...
- What?

01:26:48.379 --> 01:26:51.588
Oh, Dorothy, I'm so sorry.

01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:53.651
Here you two have just started
on your honeymoon

01:26:53.718 --> 01:26:56.289
- and I'm trying to shanghai the groom.
- I don't mind.

01:26:56.353 --> 01:26:58.594
I knew what I was getting into
when I married a composer.

01:26:58.656 --> 01:27:01.330
- I might just as well be getting used to it.
- That's marvelous.

01:27:01.392 --> 01:27:03.804
- What's marvelous?
- We're going to do a picture together.

01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:05.431
- No kidding.
- You heard the lady.

01:27:05.496 --> 01:27:08.602
Why, that's fine, but you've got to audition
for us if you're going to work for us.

01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:10.907
- Okay.
- I'll give you my personal assistance, too.

01:27:10.968 --> 01:27:12.106
Come on.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.283
Mel, take <i>I Wish I Were in Love Again,</i>
will you?

01:27:27.118 --> 01:27:30.122
<i>You don't know that I felt good</i>

01:27:30.187 --> 01:27:33.725
<i>When we up and parted</i>

01:27:33.791 --> 01:27:36.795
<i>You don't know I knocked on wood</i>

01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:40.570
<i>Gladly brokenhearted</i>

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:44.374
<i>Worrying is through, I sleep all night</i>

01:27:44.435 --> 01:27:48.906
<i>Appetite and health restored</i>

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.823
<i>You don't know how much we're bored</i>

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.360
<i>Sleepless nights, the daily fights</i>

01:27:58.415 --> 01:28:00.918
<i>The quick toboggan
when you reach the heights</i>

01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:03.397
<i>I miss the kisses and I miss the bites</i>

01:28:03.454 --> 01:28:05.957
<i>I wish I were in love again</i>

01:28:06.023 --> 01:28:08.560
<i>The broken dates, the endless waits</i>

01:28:08.626 --> 01:28:11.038
<i>The lovely loving and the hateful hates</i>

01:28:11.095 --> 01:28:13.575
<i>The conversation with the flying plates</i>

01:28:13.631 --> 01:28:16.475
<i>I wish I were in love again</i>

01:28:16.534 --> 01:28:19.037
<i>No more pain</i>

01:28:19.103 --> 01:28:21.447
<i>No more strain</i>

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:26.352
<i>Now I'm sane, but I would rather be gaga</i>

01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:28.890
<i>The pulled-out fur of cat and cur</i>

01:28:28.946 --> 01:28:30.892
<i>The fine mis-mating of a him and her</i>

01:28:30.948 --> 01:28:32.655
<i>We've learned our lesson</i>

01:28:32.716 --> 01:28:36.892
<i>and we wish we were in love again</i>

01:28:41.659 --> 01:28:44.139
<i>The furtive sigh, the blackened eye</i>

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:46.675
<i>The words, "I'll love you till the day I die"</i>

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:49.574
<i>The self-deception that believes the lie</i>

01:28:54.438 --> 01:28:57.009
<i>I wish I were in love again</i>

01:28:57.074 --> 01:28:59.486
<i>When love congeals, it soon reveals</i>

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:02.217
<i>The faint aroma of performing seals</i>

01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:04.759
<i>The double-crossing of a pair of eels</i>

01:29:09.787 --> 01:29:12.700
<i>I wish I were in love again</i>

01:29:12.756 --> 01:29:15.100
<i>No more care</i>

01:29:15.159 --> 01:29:17.867
<i>No despair</i>

01:29:17.928 --> 01:29:22.570
<i>I'm all there now
but I'd rather be punch-drunk</i>

01:29:22.633 --> 01:29:25.170
<i>Believe me, sir, I'd much prefer</i>

01:29:25.236 --> 01:29:27.648
<i>The classic battle of a him and her</i>

01:29:27.705 --> 01:29:29.082
<i>We don't like quiet</i>

01:29:29.139 --> 01:29:32.780
<i>and we wish we were in love</i>

01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:38.088
<i>again</i>

01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:02.072
More, more.

01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:10.984
Let's try Johnny One Nate in E flat, huh?

01:30:11.048 --> 01:30:12.925
Mel, will you ask some of the boys
to come down here?

01:30:12.983 --> 01:30:15.020
It'll be a little more friendly.

01:30:19.657 --> 01:30:21.898
<i>Johnny could only sing one note</i>

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:25.372
<i>And the note he sang was this</i>

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.473
<i>Poor Johnny One Note</i>

01:30:31.535 --> 01:30:33.446
<i>Sang out with gusto</i>

01:30:33.504 --> 01:30:37.782
<i>And just overlorded the place</i>

01:30:37.841 --> 01:30:41.311
<i>Poor Johnny One Note yelled willy-nilly</i>

01:30:41.378 --> 01:30:45.053
<i>Until he was blue in the face</i>

01:30:45.115 --> 01:30:48.790
<i>For holding one note was his ace</i>

01:30:48.852 --> 01:30:50.661
<i>Couldn't hear the brass</i>

01:30:50.721 --> 01:30:52.928
<i>Couldn't hear the drum</i>

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:56.904
<i>He was in a class by himself, by gum</i>

01:30:57.628 --> 01:31:01.235
<i>Poor Johnny One Note got in Aida</i>

01:31:01.298 --> 01:31:05.713
<i>Indeed a great chance to be brave</i>

01:31:05.769 --> 01:31:07.680
<i>He took his one note</i>

01:31:07.738 --> 01:31:09.445
<i>Howled like the north wind</i>

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:13.318
<i>Brought forth wind that made critics rave</i>

01:31:13.377 --> 01:31:17.018
<i>While Verdi turned round in his grave</i>

01:31:17.081 --> 01:31:18.924
<i>Couldn't hear the flute</i>

01:31:18.983 --> 01:31:21.122
<i>Or the big trombone</i>

01:31:21.185 --> 01:31:23.096
<i>Everyone was mute</i>

01:31:23.153 --> 01:31:25.997
<i>Johnny stood alone</i>

01:31:26.056 --> 01:31:28.002
<i>Cats and dogs stopped yapping</i>

01:31:28.058 --> 01:31:34.031
<i>Lions in the zoo all were
jealous of Johnny's big trill</i>

01:31:34.098 --> 01:31:36.078
<i>Thunderclaps stopped clapping</i>

01:31:36.133 --> 01:31:37.544
<i>Traffic ceased its roar</i>

01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:41.344
<i>And they tell us Niagara stood still</i>

01:31:41.405 --> 01:31:43.214
<i>He stopped the train whistles</i>

01:31:43.273 --> 01:31:46.277
<i>Boat whistles, steam whistles
cop whistles</i>

01:31:46.343 --> 01:31:50.519
<i>All whistles bowed to his skill</i>

01:31:58.589 --> 01:32:00.569
<i>Sing, Johnny One Note</i>

01:32:00.624 --> 01:32:02.228
<i>Sing out with gusto</i>

01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:06.138
<i>And just overlord all the crowd</i>

01:32:06.196 --> 01:32:10.576
<i>So sing, Johnny One Note, out loud</i>

01:32:10.634 --> 01:32:16.744
<i>Sing, Johnny One Note</i>

01:32:16.807 --> 01:32:20.016
<i>Sing, Johnny One Note</i>

01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:26.323
<i>out loud</i>

01:32:45.869 --> 01:32:48.110
- This is a swell party, huh?
- It certainly is.

01:32:48.172 --> 01:32:49.583
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.051
Hey, wait a minute.
Where you going, Eddie?

01:32:51.108 --> 01:32:52.212
- Oh, it's late.
- It's after 4:00.

01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:54.483
What's 4:00? It's early yet.
Come on, stick around.

01:32:54.545 --> 01:32:56.024
- Good night.
- We're gonna have some fun.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.151
- Good night.
- Thanks. Good night.

01:32:58.215 --> 01:33:01.788
- Well, we have to go, too, Larry.
- Wait a minute, Dick.

01:33:02.686 --> 01:33:05.189
- You two are going to stay here.
- We can't, Larry.

01:33:05.255 --> 01:33:09.032
We're staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
But we'll see you tomorrow.

01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:12.539
Well, let's have one for the road,
huh, Dick?

01:33:12.596 --> 01:33:13.973
- No, thanks, Larry.
- How about it, Dorothy?

01:33:14.031 --> 01:33:15.135
No, thank you.

01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:17.475
It sure has been a swell party, hasn't it?

01:33:17.534 --> 01:33:19.946
- Yeah, it sure has.
- Mighty fine.

01:33:20.003 --> 01:33:22.279
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night, Dorothy.

01:33:22.339 --> 01:33:25.047
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night. Good night, Dick.

01:33:30.047 --> 01:33:32.550
- Good night, Dick.
- Good night, Larry.

01:33:46.497 --> 01:33:47.976
All right, that's it for tonight, boys.

01:33:48.031 --> 01:33:51.410
Hey! Hey, Mel! Wait a minute. Hey.

01:33:51.468 --> 01:33:53.641
Hey, Mel, what's going on here?

01:33:53.704 --> 01:33:55.445
Well, we kind of figured
with everybody leaving...

01:33:55.506 --> 01:33:58.578
Oh, we don't need people.
Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellows.

01:33:58.642 --> 01:33:59.950
Keep going, will you?

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.513
Waiter, give the fellows champagne,
lots of champagne, will you?

01:34:02.579 --> 01:34:04.388
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- That's what we want. Sure.

01:34:04.448 --> 01:34:07.395
Anything special you'd like to hear,
Mr. Hart?

01:34:07.451 --> 01:34:09.727
Yeah, play...

01:34:09.786 --> 01:34:11.629
No, no, better not play that.

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.599
Play anything, anything at all, fellows.

01:34:13.657 --> 01:34:16.638
Just so it's Rodgers and Hart.

01:34:17.628 --> 01:34:20.632
Number 16, boys. Sixteen. Here we go.

01:34:28.238 --> 01:34:33.654
<i>Blue moon</i>

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:39.285
<i>You saw me standing alone</i>

01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:45.493
<i>Without a dream in my heart</i>

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:51.999
<i>Without a love of my own</i>

01:34:55.132 --> 01:34:59.672
<i>Blue moon</i>

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:04.481
<i>You knew just what I was there for</i>

01:35:06.143 --> 01:35:10.990
<i>You heard me saying a prayer for</i>

01:35:12.282 --> 01:35:18.255
<i>Someone I really could care for</i>

01:35:20.157 --> 01:35:25.630
<i>And then there suddenly
appeared before me</i>

01:35:25.696 --> 01:35:30.702
<i>The only one my arms could ever hold</i>

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:36.445
<i>I heard somebody whisper
“Please adore me“</i>

01:35:36.506 --> 01:35:38.042
<i>And when I looked</i>

01:35:38.108 --> 01:35:44.115
<i>The moon had turned to gold</i>

01:35:45.515 --> 01:35:50.589
<i>Blue moon</i>

01:35:52.322 --> 01:35:57.067
<i>Now I'm no longer alone</i>

01:35:58.629 --> 01:36:03.374
<i>Without a dream in my heart</i>

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:10.475
<i>Without a love of my own</i>

01:36:12.609 --> 01:36:18.184
<i>Blue moon</i>

01:36:29.726 --> 01:36:32.400
<i>In spite of everything, we made
quite a few pictures in Hollywood</i>

01:36:32.462 --> 01:36:34.840
<i>and the years slipped pleasantly by.</i>

01:36:34.898 --> 01:36:37.344
<i>But when we were asked
to do a Broadway show,</i>

01:36:37.401 --> 01:36:40.871
<i>we decided that change would be good,
and so we started East.</i>

01:36:40.937 --> 01:36:45.647
<i>When Dorothy and I left New York,
we were a family of two, two adults.</i>

01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:50.749
<i>But when we returned, we were a family
of four, two adults and two children.</i>

01:36:50.814 --> 01:36:52.088
Board!

01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:53.924
<i>I beg your pardon.</i>

01:36:53.984 --> 01:36:58.797
<i>We were a family of five,
two adults and three children.</i>

01:37:11.668 --> 01:37:12.738
Well?

01:37:12.803 --> 01:37:15.545
They're great, Larry,
five of the best lyrics you've ever done.

01:37:15.605 --> 01:37:16.845
Thanks, baby.

01:37:16.907 --> 01:37:18.511
But don't forget
we start rehearsing Monday,

01:37:18.575 --> 01:37:20.418
and you still haven't written
anything for the love song.

01:37:20.477 --> 01:37:22.616
Don't worry, you'll get it. Come in.

01:37:22.679 --> 01:37:24.056
Chicago in 20 minutes, gentlemen.

01:37:24.114 --> 01:37:25.218
All right.

01:37:25.282 --> 01:37:27.489
We're going to go over to the hotel
and freshen up. Corning along?

01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:30.157
Thanks very much, but there are
a couple of places I'd like to see and...

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.358
Okay-

01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:34.368
But don't forget, the Century
leaves at 4:00 and it doesn't wait.

01:37:34.424 --> 01:37:35.630
Don't worry. I'll be there.

01:37:35.692 --> 01:37:37.433
- You sure?
- You can count on me.

01:37:39.796 --> 01:37:42.208
You can't count on him, Dick!

01:37:42.265 --> 01:37:45.610
For weeks he's been promising us
the lyrics for the love song.

01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:48.115
And if we don't get them,
we have no love song.

01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:51.015
- And if we have no love song...
- We have no show. Yes, yes, I know.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:52.678
Oh, how can he act this way?

01:37:52.743 --> 01:37:55.917
I'm worried, Eddie.
This time I'm really worried.

01:37:57.013 --> 01:38:00.460
I'd go after him myself,
but I have to stay with the show.

01:38:00.517 --> 01:38:02.087
Of course, you do.

01:38:02.152 --> 01:38:05.861
Even if I caught up with him,
I don't know how much good it would do.

01:38:05.922 --> 01:38:08.425
He's taken an awful lot of sermons
from me.

01:38:09.793 --> 01:38:11.739
But we gotta get him back.

01:38:11.795 --> 01:38:15.106
Look, Dick, you know how much
I love the little guy.

01:38:15.165 --> 01:38:17.270
Why don't you let me take a crack at it?

01:38:17.334 --> 01:38:19.336
- Will you?
- You know I will.

01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:22.843
<i>But Larry couldn't be located anywhere.</i>

01:38:22.906 --> 01:38:27.218
<i>Confused and dispirited,
among strange people and strange places,</i>

01:38:27.277 --> 01:38:30.884
<i>he was just a lost guy
and no one could help him.</i>

01:38:30.947 --> 01:38:33.086
<i>He had to find his way back alone.</i>

01:38:34.151 --> 01:38:35.926
Warm for spring, isn't it?

01:38:38.555 --> 01:38:40.262
Nice breeze, though.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.907
It's a lovely night with the stars and all.

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.237
So I hear.

01:38:54.538 --> 01:38:55.983
Wait a minute.

01:38:57.574 --> 01:38:59.315
Spring is here.

01:39:00.777 --> 01:39:03.314
Why doesn't the breeze delight me?

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:07.952
Stars appear.

01:39:10.587 --> 01:39:12.999
Why doesn't the night invite me?

01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:21.234
Maybe it's because nobody loves me.

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:27.641
Spring is here,

01:39:29.739 --> 01:39:30.877
I hear.

01:39:30.941 --> 01:39:33.649
- Taxi!
- Taxi.

01:39:34.744 --> 01:39:35.848
Yeah.

01:39:37.047 --> 01:39:39.425
Yeah, taxi. Of course, taxi!

01:39:39.483 --> 01:39:41.326
Sea, you later, baby. Take care. Here.

01:39:41.384 --> 01:39:43.864
If you don't like it,
trade it in on a lawn mower.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.161
- Hey, where are you going?
- I gotta see somebody.

01:39:46.223 --> 01:39:47.827
Airport, driver.

01:39:57.033 --> 01:39:58.376
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:39:58.435 --> 01:39:59.539
Thank you.

01:40:04.808 --> 01:40:05.946
Hey!

01:40:06.009 --> 01:40:08.546
How about coming down here
and helping a fellow, huh?

01:40:08.612 --> 01:40:10.216
- Uncle Larry!
- Larry!

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.315
- Larry.
- Larry.

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:12.655
- Hello, Linda.
- Uncle Larry!

01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:13.786
- Linda, darling.
- Hiya, Larry.

01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:14.885
Why, it's so good to see you.

01:40:14.951 --> 01:40:17.022
- Hello, Dorothy.
- What are those? Presents?

01:40:17.087 --> 01:40:18.566
- Oh, Linda, now, really.
- Oh, boy!

01:40:18.622 --> 01:40:20.693
Here this is for you
and the purple and blue one is for you.

01:40:20.757 --> 01:40:22.031
- Oh, boy.
- All right, sweetheart.

01:40:22.092 --> 01:40:23.400
- Oh, Larry.
- Don't I get a kiss?

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.803
All right. This is for you, too, Dorothy.

01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:26.807
Thank you, Linda.
And this is, of course, for you, Dick.

01:40:26.863 --> 01:40:28.604
Well, thank you, Mr. Hart.

01:40:28.665 --> 01:40:31.236
- Mr. Rodgers.
- Larry, you look tired.

01:40:31.301 --> 01:40:33.611
Tired? Me? Don't be silly.

01:40:34.504 --> 01:40:36.848
Well, I am.
Let's go over and sit on the terrace.

01:40:36.907 --> 01:40:39.888
- Us, too?
- No, Mary, not us two, us three.

01:40:39.943 --> 01:40:42.150
You two take your presents,
say thank you, and go play.

01:40:42.212 --> 01:40:43.623
- Thank you, Uncle Larry.
- Thank you, Uncle Larry.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.750
- All right, darlings.
- Go on.

01:40:44.814 --> 01:40:46.418
- Oh, Larry.
- It's good to see you, Larry.

01:40:46.483 --> 01:40:47.518
Good to see you, too, darling.

01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:51.497
This is very nice.

01:40:52.322 --> 01:40:54.131
I like this.

01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.002
I even like the grass and the trees.

01:40:58.061 --> 01:40:59.904
Well, why don't you try it for a while?

01:40:59.963 --> 01:41:03.103
Yes, Larry, why don't you?
Why don't you stay?

01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:04.770
I'd like to very much.

01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:07.273
I'd like to.

01:41:07.337 --> 01:41:09.977
Well, Mr. Hart, tell us where you've been.

01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:13.049
To a couple more places.

01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:15.646
Would you like something to eat
or something to drink?

01:41:15.712 --> 01:41:18.158
No. No, thank you. I'd just like to

01:41:19.182 --> 01:41:23.961
sit here and look at you and the children
and this place.

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.626
The air here is so wonderful.

01:41:44.708 --> 01:41:46.278
Coffee, darling?

01:41:49.112 --> 01:41:50.352
Thanks.

01:41:55.452 --> 01:41:58.296
- Remember Peggy?
- Peggy?

01:41:59.723 --> 01:42:00.827
Yeah.

01:42:03.093 --> 01:42:05.596
I hear she hasn't been doing so well.

01:42:07.564 --> 01:42:10.477
Do you think I ought to try and help her?

01:42:11.234 --> 01:42:13.145
If it would help you.

01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:14.940
Probably won't.

01:42:17.307 --> 01:42:19.253
Nothing seems to add up.

01:42:20.143 --> 01:42:21.816
I'm not kidding myself.

01:42:23.546 --> 01:42:25.389
Peggy isn't real anymore.

01:42:26.383 --> 01:42:29.887
She's a symbol, a symbol of failure.

01:42:30.887 --> 01:42:34.664
- A long line of failures.
- What failures?

01:42:34.724 --> 01:42:37.568
- Stop talking that way, Larry.
- It's the truth.

01:42:37.627 --> 01:42:41.131
I've done all right with my work, yes.

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:43.768
But I've failed in everything else.

01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:46.439
Everything. Don't ask me why.

01:42:48.238 --> 01:42:49.842
I don't know why.

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:53.887
I'm on a constant merry-go-round.

01:42:54.878 --> 01:42:56.585
And that's no good, baby.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.554
Let's face it,
maybe Mr. Hart's lyrics are a hit,

01:43:01.685 --> 01:43:04.063
but Mr. Hart's life is a flop.

01:43:05.822 --> 01:43:08.803
Don't you know
you're one of the sweetest,

01:43:08.858 --> 01:43:11.668
most generous,
talented men in the world?

01:43:12.862 --> 01:43:17.106
Look, Larry,
why don't you stay here with us? Close.

01:43:17.167 --> 01:43:18.771
And start working again.

01:43:18.835 --> 01:43:21.008
Dick has a play lined up for Gene Kelly.

01:43:21.071 --> 01:43:23.017
- He needs you.
- Yeah, I know, baby, but I...

01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:25.815
You're confused, darling.
And it takes time.

01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:28.321
But, Larry,
you can't let yourself go like this.

01:43:28.378 --> 01:43:31.222
You must go on with your work.
It's too important.

01:43:32.682 --> 01:43:35.891
Stay here and go back to work?

01:43:40.657 --> 01:43:43.501
Okay, baby. I'll try.

01:43:44.894 --> 01:43:47.033
I'll start trying right now.

01:43:47.931 --> 01:43:49.239
And thanks.

01:51:33.396 --> 01:51:35.273
Congratulations, Larry.
The show is terrific.

01:51:35.331 --> 01:51:37.038
- Larry! Oh, Larry!
- Darling!

01:51:37.366 --> 01:51:38.811
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks a million.

01:51:38.868 --> 01:51:39.972
- Just great.
- Oh, thanks.

01:51:40.036 --> 01:51:41.845
- Where's Dick?
- He's right over there.

01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:43.815
Tremendous.

01:51:43.873 --> 01:51:46.752
Superb performance, Mr. Hart.
I am proud of you.

01:51:46.809 --> 01:51:49.847
Oh, Vera. Vera, I can't tell you
how wonderful you were.

01:51:49.912 --> 01:51:51.983
Thank you. Thanks very much.

01:51:52.048 --> 01:51:54.995
Another hit.
The music, every single thing...

01:51:56.485 --> 01:51:58.522
- Larry!
- Larry!

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:02.801
Somebody call a doctor!
Call a doctor, somebody!

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.137
Call a doctor!

01:52:06.195 --> 01:52:08.334
Somebody call a doctor!

01:52:09.966 --> 01:52:12.344
<i>Months later, Larry was still very ill.</i>

01:52:12.668 --> 01:52:17.083
During those months we had completed
a revival of a Connecticut Yankee.

01:52:17.139 --> 01:52:20.416
<i>To do it, Larry had
to call on his last reserves.</i>

01:52:20.476 --> 01:52:23.685
<i>And by opening night,
his condition was desperate.</i>

01:52:23.746 --> 01:52:26.590
Dick, can I go with you?

01:52:27.516 --> 01:52:30.258
You've heard most of the songs before.

01:52:30.319 --> 01:52:33.300
And my singing won't make
you feel any better.

01:52:33.356 --> 01:52:36.667
I'll come back after each number
and tell you everything.

01:52:36.726 --> 01:52:39.673
- Here, Larry.
- What is it?

01:52:39.729 --> 01:52:43.404
Take it, and when you wake up
you'll have a big hit.

01:52:56.979 --> 01:52:58.287
Mr. Hart.

01:53:00.449 --> 01:53:01.860
Mr. Rodgers.

01:53:25.541 --> 01:53:26.679
Theater.

01:53:29.245 --> 01:53:32.089
I gotta get to the theater.

01:53:58.374 --> 01:53:59.876
The theater.

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.488
Taxi, mister? Hey, mister! Taxi?

01:54:42.184 --> 01:54:45.063
- Martin Beck Theater, please.
- Okay.

01:56:45.207 --> 01:56:47.084
- What happened? Get a doctor.
- Stand back. Stand back.

01:56:47.142 --> 01:56:49.816
Hurry, hurry, get a doctor. Get a doctor.

01:56:51.914 --> 01:56:54.622
<i>Some time later,
before a packed audience,</i>

01:56:54.683 --> 01:56:58.358
<i>the greatest figures in show business
joined in paying tribute</i>

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:02.027
<i>to the memory of the little guy
who thought that he was all alone.</i>

01:57:03.526 --> 01:57:05.062
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:57:05.127 --> 01:57:09.769
I am one of hundreds of people in
the theater, in pictures and on the radio,

01:57:09.832 --> 01:57:13.609
who has had the happy experience
of being in a Rodgers and Hart show.

01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:16.679
And it was a happy experience

01:57:16.739 --> 01:57:18.116
because as show people,

01:57:18.173 --> 01:57:21.052
we respected and admired them
for what they were doing.

01:57:21.110 --> 01:57:24.216
Larry's lyrics were
gay and clever and witty,

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.692
but in them all was the note of sadness.

01:57:27.249 --> 01:57:32.392
They were and are and will be a source of
beauty and pleasure to millions of people.

01:57:33.355 --> 01:57:36.063
Among the best loved
of Larry's lyrics are these

01:57:36.125 --> 01:57:38.401
that Perry Como sings for us tonight,

01:57:39.328 --> 01:57:41.308
<i>With a Song in My Heart.</i>

01:57:57.913 --> 01:58:03.158
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

01:58:04.153 --> 01:58:10.069
<i>I behold your adorable face</i>

01:58:10.726 --> 01:58:15.698
<i>With a song at the start</i>

01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:21.877
<i>But it soon is a hymn to your grace</i>

01:58:23.272 --> 01:58:28.585
<i>When the music swells</i>

01:58:28.644 --> 01:58:32.592
<i>I'm touching your hand</i>

01:58:34.216 --> 01:58:36.253
<i>We'll have Manhattan</i>

01:58:36.318 --> 01:58:39.094
<i>The Bronx and Staten Island, too</i>

01:58:40.155 --> 01:58:46.504
<i>It's lovely going through the zoo</i>

01:58:47.129 --> 01:58:51.578
<i>Where's that rainbow you hear about?</i>

01:58:51.634 --> 01:58:55.912
<i>Where's that lining they cheer about?</i>

01:58:57.172 --> 01:59:00.779
<i>Thou swell, thou witty</i>

01:59:00.843 --> 01:59:04.188
<i>Thou sweet, thou grand</i>

01:59:04.246 --> 01:59:07.557
<i>Wouldst kiss me pretty?</i>

01:59:07.616 --> 01:59:11.063
<i>Wouldst hold my hand?</i>

01:59:11.887 --> 01:59:17.701
<i>I like the free, fresh wind in my hair</i>

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:20.104
<i>Life without care</i>

01:59:20.162 --> 01:59:22.506
<i>I'm broke, that's oke</i>

01:59:24.633 --> 01:59:27.136
<i>The pulled-out fur of cat and cur</i>

01:59:27.202 --> 01:59:29.409
<i>The fine mis-mating of a him and her</i>

01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:30.779
<i>We've learned our lesson</i>

01:59:30.839 --> 01:59:34.616
<i>and we wish we were in love again</i>

01:59:53.128 --> 01:59:56.132
<i>But I always knew</i>

01:59:56.198 --> 01:59:59.077
<i>I always knew</i>

01:59:59.134 --> 02:00:02.547
<i>I would live life through</i>

02:00:02.604 --> 02:00:06.051
<i>I would live life through</i>

02:00:06.108 --> 02:00:09.954
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

02:00:10.012 --> 02:00:15.826
<i>for you</i>

02:00:19.955 --> 02:00:25.701
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

02:00:25.761 --> 02:00:30.574
<i>for you</i>

02:00:30.632 --> 02:00:36.082
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

02:00:37.305 --> 02:00:43.486
