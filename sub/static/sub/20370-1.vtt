Subrip: Pix

00:28.662 --> 00:30.929
Yes, mom, I'm getting
off the train, right now.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.664
Okay, I told you
I would call you

00:32.700 --> 00:34.500
when I got
to the rental place.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.834
Mom, it's only for two weeks.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.270
I'm sure you and dad
will be fine.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.972
Yes, I know
it's our busy season, mom.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.640
Yes, but you're also
the one who told me

00:41.675 --> 00:42.808
that I needed a vacation,

00:42.843 --> 00:44.276
so here I am.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.478
Yes, I will keep my receipts,
don't worry.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.813
Fi love you, too...

00:47.848 --> 00:49.048
Frank! Frank!

00:49.083 --> 00:50.049
Shoot...

00:51.152 --> 00:53.786
Frank! Frank! Frank!

00:53.821 --> 00:54.820
Frank! Frank!

00:54.855 --> 00:56.021
Down!

00:56.057 --> 00:56.855
He got away from me,
I'm sorry.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.323
It's okay.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.899
It's... it's okay.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.300
You all right, Mozart?

01:08.335 --> 01:09.835
Mozart?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.070
Yes, after the composer.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.205
I know who Mozart is.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.373
I'm sure you do.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.374
No offense.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.041
You okay, Mozart?

01:16.077 --> 01:17.910
Is this mean dog
scaring you?

01:17.945 --> 01:19.311
Frank's not really mean.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.345
Frank?

01:20.381 --> 01:21.213
Yeah, after the singer.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.384
Well, anyway...

01:26.287 --> 01:27.853
Excuse me.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.321
Hope you have a nice day.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.823
You too.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.861
You're not really mean,
are you, Frank?

01:36.897 --> 01:37.863
No, you're not.

01:37.898 --> 01:38.864
Let's go.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.836
It should have
wireless capabilities.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.405
Electric, obviously.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.439
And if it has a sunroof,

01:47.475 --> 01:48.574
it should have a uv coating

01:48.609 --> 01:50.042
on the interior
of the glass as well.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.077
Excuse me for a second.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.014
Hi, honey.
I'm just getting my rental car.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.015
<i>Electric?</i>

01:57.051 --> 01:58.016
Obviously.

01:58.052 --> 01:59.618
<i>UV?</i>

01:59.653 --> 02:00.619
<i>You know how you burn.</i>

02:00.654 --> 02:02.020
I'm not going to be outside
that much anyway.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.422
I have two weeks
to finish my thesis.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.023
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear that.</i>

02:05.059 --> 02:06.892
<i>You really need
to focus, Spencer.</i>

02:06.927 --> 02:08.860
<i>My father doesn't give out
these grants to just anybody.</i>

02:08.895 --> 02:09.928
I know.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.363
I wi promise.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.364
Okay, I've gotta go.

02:12.399 --> 02:13.365
<i>Call me later.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.000
I wi love...

02:16.070 --> 02:16.935
You.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.838
That's my girlfriend.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.775
She worries.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.219
This place is so beautiful.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.654
No wonder you love living here.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.655
<i>Well, I can't wait to see you.</i>

02:36.690 --> 02:38.757
How long has it been?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.259
Since your wedding, right?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.393
<i>A whole year?</i>

02:41.428 --> 02:42.961
That's crazy.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.329
We've got a lot of
catching up to do.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.131
Yes, just let me
get settled in at the house,

02:46.167 --> 02:47.399
and then we'll go out, okay?

02:47.434 --> 02:48.300
First Margarita's on me.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.736
About that.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.137
What? come on,
don't tell me

02:52.173 --> 02:54.273
you've changed that much
since college.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.575
Like I said, we've got
a lot of catching up to do.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.809
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

02:57.845 --> 02:59.478
Okay, see you later.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.637
Do you believe it, Frank?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.839
This whole place is ours,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.808
just us, two whole weeks.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.644
This is amazing, Frank.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.146
Do you see this?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.849
My gosh...

03:57.004 --> 04:00.372
Look at this view...

04:06.914 --> 04:08.547
Didn't look this big
on the website.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.921
Frank...

04:15.956 --> 04:17.555
Come here.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.291
Frank...

04:22.796 --> 04:25.564
They must have
a big family.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.840
This is nice.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.910
What, not up to your standards?

04:46.086 --> 04:49.187
Now, this is more like it?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.361
Yeah.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.830
I think it's exactly
what we need.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.269
Now, while that's chilling,

05:04.305 --> 05:06.204
let's go take
some shots outside.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.611
Come on, Frank.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.289
All right, Mozart,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.925
this is home
for the next two weeks.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.265
Isn't that thoughtful.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.068
It's good, too.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.971
Deserves a better glass
than this.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.110
How about this one?

06:20.347 --> 06:21.546
No?

06:21.582 --> 06:22.681
Yeah.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.218
Anybody could've taken this.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.854
Maybe that's my problem.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.358
What do you think, Mozart?

06:33.394 --> 06:35.127
How do you like the place?

06:47.241 --> 06:49.241
What's wrong with you?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.309
What?

06:51.345 --> 06:52.310
What's wrong with you?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.781
Frank!

06:57.384 --> 06:58.483
Frank!

06:59.953 --> 07:02.254
Frank!

07:03.690 --> 07:04.723
Frank!

07:06.260 --> 07:07.726
-You!
-you!

07:07.761 --> 07:09.327
What's your dog
doing in my house?

07:09.363 --> 07:11.329
What's your cat
doing in my house?

07:11.365 --> 07:14.199
Actually, what are you
doing in my house?

07:14.234 --> 07:14.966
That's an easy one.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.501
It's not your house,
it's mine.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.436
Come on, Mozart.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.336
Let's get you
somewhere safe,

07:18.372 --> 07:19.738
away from that animal.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.673
He has a name.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.009
That's okay,
you're not a mean dog.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.410
No, you're not...

07:25.446 --> 07:26.845
It's fine, buddy.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.748
Please don't be scratched.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.284
Please don't be scratched...

07:32.319 --> 07:34.553
It took me an entire year
to find this album.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.054
Can't you just
download it?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.791
It's not the same.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.359
It's like the difference
between the sunshine

07:41.395 --> 07:42.394
and a tanning bed.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.097
Okay...

07:46.133 --> 07:46.998
Would you like to tell me

07:47.034 --> 07:48.366
what you and your dog
are doing here?

07:48.402 --> 07:50.268
Look, all I know is

07:50.304 --> 07:52.270
that I rented this house
for spring break.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.805
See?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.607
I had to fill out
this whole questionnaire.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.712
And then I go out
to walk my dog,

08:00.747 --> 08:02.914
and I come back,
and I find you,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.483
here, drinking my wine.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.584
I picked it up
on the way here.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.185
I thought it was a gift from
the rental company.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.424
I... filled out
the same questionnaire.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.226
Starting today.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.128
Starting today.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.165
Well, obviously, there's been
some sort of mistake.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.099
Obviously.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.501
But I don't know how.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.969
It was a very personal
questionnaire.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.338
They seemed to have
every other detail covered.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.340
I mean, "favorite color,"
"favorite food,"

08:28.375 --> 08:29.040
"favorite movie..."

08:29.076 --> 08:30.575
What did you answer for food?

08:30.611 --> 08:31.443
Italian.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.443
Me too.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.445
Favorite movie?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.412
"Casablanca."

08:34.448 --> 08:36.448
Me too.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.751
Well, maybe they thought
we were the same person?

08:39.785 --> 08:41.785
Same reservation
and canceled the other one?

08:41.822 --> 08:43.788
Yeah.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.757
Laura Haley.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.292
I'm sorry?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.660
Well, if we're going to be
stuck in the same boat,

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
we'd better know
each other's names.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.430
Mine's Laura Haley.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.465
What's yours?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.933
Spencer.
Spencer Hodkins.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.001
Well, Spencer Hodkins.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.469
It appears as though

08:57.504 --> 08:58.670
we have ourselves
a problem.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.308
There you go, Frank,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.511
specialty of the house.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.948
Great, the rental company
just got back to us.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.316
"We will look...

09:13.253 --> 09:16.855
"We will look into the matter
and get back to you."

09:16.890 --> 09:19.157
There we go,
problem solved.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.692
That's a little optimistic.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.460
Well, I'm
an optimistic person.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.229
That's not what I mean,
it's just...

09:24.264 --> 09:26.197
That's an automated
response message.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.832
They probably didn't
even read my email.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.135
Maybe you should have been
a little more personal.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.703
Here, may I?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.038
Be my guest.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.539
Thank you.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.575
"Hi! how are you?

09:36.610 --> 09:38.243
"I'm fine.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.211
"I'm loving the house
that you found for me

09:40.247 --> 09:41.179
"here in South Haven.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.349
"Now, I don't want to be
a bother or anything,

09:44.384 --> 09:45.817
"but I was wondering
if you could help me

09:45.852 --> 09:47.319
"with a little
problem I'm having.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.054
You see, there's
this man who's..."

09:49.089 --> 09:50.822
You know maybe just
leave that as it is.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.723
But I thought you
wanted a reply.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.857
Well, I do.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.092
But it's a psychological fact

09:54.127 --> 09:55.360
that people respond better

09:55.395 --> 09:57.829
to polite, short exchanges
over the Internet,

09:57.864 --> 10:01.499
rather than long, drawn-out,
and weirdly chatty emails.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.201
And you're
an expert on this?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.870
I am working towards my Ph.D.
in psychology right now.

10:05.906 --> 10:06.838
Really?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.007
Really.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.542
I'm a T.A.
over at the university.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.043
I took this place
to work on my dissertation.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.214
And... what do you do?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.248
Are you in school?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.683
No, I graduated last year.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.618
B.A. in business.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.019
And now?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.688
Now I'm here visiting
my old college roommate

10:23.724 --> 10:24.856
and her husband.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.024
By yourself?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.559
Yeah, why not?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.729
I mean, you don't
have a boyfriend or...?

10:30.764 --> 10:31.997
I've got Frank.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.634
Speaking of,

10:35.669 --> 10:37.268
would you mind
putting him someplace

10:37.304 --> 10:39.404
so I can bring Mozart
out for his dinner?

10:39.439 --> 10:41.706
Why can't you go feed
Mozart somewhere else?

10:43.410 --> 10:44.009
Miss Haley...

10:45.345 --> 10:46.911
This is an awkward
situation

10:46.947 --> 10:48.546
for both of us,
agreed?

10:48.582 --> 10:49.547
Agreed.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.282
And the only way we're
going to get through this

10:51.318 --> 10:53.551
is if we treat each other
with dignity and respect.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.486
Agreed?

10:54.521 --> 10:55.387
Agreed.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.088
That includes respecting
each other's pets.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.356
Agreed?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.126
Fine.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.460
Come on, Frank,

11:02.496 --> 11:04.095
let's go.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.096
Thank you.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.470
And if we don't hear back

11:12.506 --> 11:14.239
from the rental company
in an hour or so,

11:14.274 --> 11:15.774
you should probably
start calling

11:15.809 --> 11:17.742
the hotels around town
to find room.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.278
Good idea.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.814
Wait, what?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.249
I'm sure there's someplace

11:24.284 --> 11:26.151
you and Mozart can stay
for the night.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.419
Wait a minute,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.187
why am I the one
that has to leave?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.690
Well... someone has to.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.358
What are you doing?

11:33.393 --> 11:34.659
You told me
to put my dog away.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.127
-No, not in the...
-No, Frank!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.530
Mozart?

11:39.666 --> 11:40.799
Sorry, Mozart.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.833
He's not going
to hurt you.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.802
He doesn't
want to hurt her,

11:43.837 --> 11:45.537
he just wants to play.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.705
Well, my cat
doesn't know that.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.507
Could you please just
get your dog

11:49.543 --> 11:50.775
out of my room?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.346
How is this your room?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.347
I was here first.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.183
See? My luggage.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.785
Really? well,
how about my luggage?

12:00.821 --> 12:01.886
I thought
that was laundry.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.624
Come on, Frank, let's go play
with the squeaky squirrel.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.830
Come on, Mozart.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.967
Come on, Mozart.

12:16.002 --> 12:16.901
It's okay, kitty.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.036
Come on...

12:21.675 --> 12:23.308
Come on, Mozart.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.851
This whole house mix-up thing

12:32.886 --> 12:34.352
doesn't seem to be
bothering you very much.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.286
Yeah, well,

12:35.322 --> 12:36.554
there's nothing we can
do about it right now.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.323
Que sera sera.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.492
"Que sera sera..."

12:40.527 --> 12:41.626
Yeah,

12:41.661 --> 12:42.894
"whatever will be, will be."
Like the song, you know...

12:42.929 --> 12:44.596
I know where it's from.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.232
You don't have to be rude.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.601
I'm sorry.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.902
It's just, well, I...

12:50.937 --> 12:52.570
I like to plan,

12:52.606 --> 12:54.572
and I was planning on
having some peace and quiet

12:54.608 --> 12:56.374
to get my work done.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.343
Yeah, well, this wasn't
exactly what I wanted

12:58.378 --> 13:00.011
when I rented the place either.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.946
You mean when
I rented the place.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.015
Fine, you rented the place,
I rented the place.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.416
So, what are we going
to do about it?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.252
Maybe I can help?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.355
Hi.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.423
Who are you?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.625
I'm Ellen.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.759
Ellen Davis.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.928
I own the place.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.101
When I got the text message
from the rental company,

13:23.136 --> 13:24.869
I came over
as soon as I could.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.237
It's probably just
a computer glitch

13:26.273 --> 13:27.272
or something.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.406
That must be it,

13:28.441 --> 13:29.407
but the problem
remains,

13:29.442 --> 13:31.976
I have two tenants,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.078
and only one house.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.114
What about
another rental?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.816
I can put in
a request for you,

13:37.851 --> 13:38.950
but we probably
won't hear anything

13:38.985 --> 13:40.418
until tomorrow.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.454
And none of the hotels
in this town take pets,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.089
cats or dogs.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.057
What are we supposed to do?

13:46.092 --> 13:48.960
Right, well...

13:48.995 --> 13:50.028
I'll tell you what.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.163
I'm going to waive
the first night's rental fee.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.097
No, you don't
have to do that...

13:53.133 --> 13:54.065
Thank you,

13:54.100 --> 13:55.733
that's so nice of you.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.602
And I'll check back

13:57.637 --> 13:58.503
with you tomorrow,

13:58.538 --> 14:00.738
but for
right now, I...

14:00.774 --> 14:03.241
I guess it's
up to the both of you.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.509
So, what do you think?

14:04.544 --> 14:08.546
Can you get along
for just one night?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.491
Is it safe
out here?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.927
Frank is upstairs,
asleep in the bedroom.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.297
It's not all
his fault, you know.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.000
Nice camera.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.935
My dad had a d8100.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.136
You a photographer?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.138
Me? No. Not really.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.607
I just like to take pictures.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.608
Can I see some?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.277
No, I don't ever
show anybody.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.378
It's just for me.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.980
Why not?

14:43.917 --> 14:46.150
That's for me.
I ordered a pizza.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.454
Of course you did.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.891
Want some?

14:52.926 --> 14:53.992
No, thank you.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.760
I'm eating raw
this month.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.299
And I don't suppose
your cat wants any either?

15:01.334 --> 15:02.700
Definitely not.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.335
Mozart is on
a very special diet.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.538
Frank pretty much just eats
whatever falls on the floor.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.873
There you go then.

15:08.909 --> 15:09.841
What do you mean?

15:09.876 --> 15:11.075
The difference,

15:11.111 --> 15:12.010
between cats and dogs.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.316
Delicious.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.020
Delicious.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.929
Hi!

15:30.964 --> 15:32.530
Surprise!

15:32.565 --> 15:33.665
My gosh!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.199
Yeah, surprise!

15:35.235 --> 15:37.068
My gosh...

15:40.974 --> 15:41.940
I know.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.211
Wait, so there's
a guy in your place?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.347
Yeah, it's just a mix-up
with the rental company.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.448
It's fine.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.617
Why don't you come
stay with us?

15:52.652 --> 15:53.584
That's very, very sweet,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.620
but I've already paid
for the house, you know.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.089
They're not going
to push me out, don't worry.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.590
Okay, just for one night,

15:59.626 --> 16:02.093
and plus, I've got Frank
to protect me,

16:02.128 --> 16:03.728
right, Frank?

16:03.763 --> 16:04.796
All right, well,

16:04.831 --> 16:05.930
if you ladies
will excuse me,

16:05.966 --> 16:09.367
I've got a nursery that's
not going to paint itself.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.710
I thought maybe

16:18.745 --> 16:20.044
you were going
to bring David.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
You guys make
such a cute couple.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.615
Yeah, well, now he's
making a cute couple

16:24.651 --> 16:25.483
with someone else.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.286
I'm sorry.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.253
No, it's okay.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.421
It's my fault, mainly.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.323
He wanted a commitment,

16:32.359 --> 16:34.993
and I just wasn't ready.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.461
I feel like
I'm not ready for anything.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.628
What do you mean?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.496
I mean that

16:38.531 --> 16:40.832
I've been out of school
for over a year,

16:40.867 --> 16:43.101
and I just feel like I'm lost.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.303
You know, I see you and Kenny,

16:45.338 --> 16:47.305
and you're having a baby.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.941
You're getting on
with your life.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.676
And I'm still at home,

16:51.711 --> 16:53.911
working at my parents'
accounting business.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.013
It's a good job.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.114
I know,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.950
it's just, it's their job,

16:58.985 --> 17:00.284
it's not mine.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.119
I'm just scared

17:01.154 --> 17:02.453
that I'm going
to wake up some morning,

17:02.489 --> 17:03.488
and see my mother

17:03.523 --> 17:06.124
staring back at me
in the mirror.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.092
Okay.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.894
So, what do you want to do
with your life?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.330
That's just it.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.599
I have no idea.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.935
At all.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.807
<i>So, how's the house?</i>

17:22.842 --> 17:23.775
It's beautiful.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.709
Right on the water,

17:24.743 --> 17:26.277
and I am going to get
so much work done

17:26.311 --> 17:27.345
once they're gone.

17:28.982 --> 17:31.382
<i>When who's gone?</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:36.387
<i>Spencer...</i>

17:36.423 --> 17:38.122
<i>I thought you were alone
in the house?</i>

17:38.158 --> 17:39.557
I will be.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.392
It's just,
the rental company,

17:41.428 --> 17:42.493
they messed
something up,

17:42.529 --> 17:43.961
and they
double-booked the place.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.163
<i>With who?</i>

17:46.533 --> 17:47.832
It's just this old guy.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.900
He's kinda smelly,

17:48.935 --> 17:50.368
and he's got
this mutt.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.638
But they'll
be gone tomorrow.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.705
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

17:54.741 --> 17:56.841
<i>You really need
to concentrate, Spencer.</i>

17:56.876 --> 17:59.210
<i>My father is counting on you,
and so am I.</i>

17:59.245 --> 18:01.479
I know, and I will.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.014
I miss you.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.082
Do you miss me?

18:04.117 --> 18:07.018
<i>Well, it's been
pretty busy around here,</i>

18:07.053 --> 18:08.219
<i>but, of course, I do.</i>

18:08.254 --> 18:09.187
<i>Goodnight, Spencer.</i>

18:09.222 --> 18:10.154
Goodnight.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.422
I love...

18:11.458 --> 18:13.291
You.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.595
What?

18:17.630 --> 18:18.362
It wasn't exactly a lie.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.169
Besides,
they'll be gone tomorrow.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.506
Nobody will ever know,
and nobody will get hurt.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.876
You found
your luggage.

18:31.911 --> 18:32.777
Yeah.

18:32.812 --> 18:33.845
Thank you.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.246
Goodnight.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.215
Goodnight.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.874
Good morning, Frank.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.877
Five more minutes.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.582
What is that?

19:13.953 --> 19:15.286
Morning.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.455
Yeah, it is.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.790
I like to get
an early jump on the day.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.159
At 6:00 A.M.?

19:21.194 --> 19:23.828
Yeah, best time
to do exercises.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.063
No noises, no distractions.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.466
I can work myself
into a calm,

19:28.501 --> 19:29.767
meditative state.

19:33.039 --> 19:33.871
Frank!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.482
Just a minute!

20:00.567 --> 20:01.899
All yours.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.018
Hey, I'm making a Kale,
beet, celery, vinegar,

20:21.054 --> 20:23.821
bark extract smoothie,
do you want some?

20:23.856 --> 20:26.557
I'm fine, thanks.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.926
That's not very good
for you, you know!

21:41.167 --> 21:42.366
Hey...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.068
Hello?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.736
Could-could you turn
your music down, please?

21:45.772 --> 21:46.704
What?

21:46.739 --> 21:49.607
The... the music,
could you turn it down?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.142
I'm trying to write.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.610
Well, I'm trying
to get inspiration

21:52.645 --> 21:53.744
for my photographs.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.580
Could you use headphones?

21:56.616 --> 21:58.416
No, I don't like them.

22:06.926 --> 22:07.758
And I thought

22:07.794 --> 22:09.560
we were going to attempt
to get along.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.729
We were,
until you called me smelly

22:11.764 --> 22:13.831
and my dog a mutt.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.199
How did you...?

22:18.805 --> 22:20.004
At least we're saved.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.938
It's the rental company.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.673
I'm sure they've found
something by now.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.009
Good, you won't be
stuck with me anymore.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.745
And you won't be stuck
with me anymore.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.246
Hello.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.182
Yes.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.021
Okay, good, very well.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.022
Thank you.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.023
Goodbye.

22:39.058 --> 22:39.990
Well?

22:42.295 --> 22:43.894
We're stuck with each other.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.499
Well, I guess the best
way for us to do this

22:48.534 --> 22:50.267
is submit our respective
meal plans,

22:50.303 --> 22:51.769
and then divide up
the cost of the groceries.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.471
Meal plans?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.039
Yeah, you just decide
what you want

22:55.074 --> 22:56.307
for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner

22:56.342 --> 22:57.942
for the following week,

22:57.977 --> 22:59.176
and then shop accordingly.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.845
Are you kidding?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.713
I never plan
that far in advance.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.515
It's not that difficult.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.850
You just...

23:07.153 --> 23:09.820
Make a choice
and stick with it.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.490
Okay, well, what if
I decide on chicken wings

23:12.525 --> 23:13.624
for Thursday,

23:13.659 --> 23:15.459
and then by Wednesday,
I change my mind

23:15.495 --> 23:16.193
and I want
macaroni and cheese,

23:16.229 --> 23:17.561
and I'm stuck?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.130
Well, you can't just
order pizza every day.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.231
I don't.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.133
Sometimes, I get Chinese,

23:22.168 --> 23:24.802
or Mexican, and Thai.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.204
You know, that's not exactly
a healthy way to live.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.607
Okay, fine.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.476
I'm going to go
get some groceries.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.878
Good.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.389
There we go.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.491
Graham crackers, marshmallows,
and a chocolate bar.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.161
That's what you're
going to eat?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.328
Are you kidding?

23:51.364 --> 23:53.330
About what?

23:53.366 --> 23:54.698
You've never
had s'mores before?

23:54.734 --> 23:56.267
You take the chocolate,

23:56.302 --> 23:58.102
and you melt it with
the marshmallow, and then...

23:58.137 --> 23:59.670
I know what s'mores are,
thank you.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.505
I just choose not
to put that much sugar

24:01.541 --> 24:03.841
and whatever other
chemicals are in that

24:03.876 --> 24:05.042
into my body.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.578
Well, I do.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.750
Okay, so tell me about
this paper you're writing?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.618
My thesis?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.554
I don't think you'd be
very interested in that.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.955
Try me.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.890
Okay...

24:19.926 --> 24:22.526
You know much
about psychology?

24:22.562 --> 24:24.595
I've got two slightly
overbearing parents,

24:24.630 --> 24:25.629
does that count?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.633
I'm presenting a paper
on psychobiology,

24:29.669 --> 24:31.268
specifically as it relates
to human emotion.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.237
So, kind of like

24:33.272 --> 24:35.005
how the taste
of pizza makes me happy?

24:36.275 --> 24:38.275
Not exactly.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.211
My theory is that
any strong emotion,

24:40.246 --> 24:41.946
like love or heartbreak,

24:41.981 --> 24:43.814
is nothing more than a series
of chemical reactions

24:43.850 --> 24:44.949
in the brain.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.617
You sound just
like my father.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.320
He reduces everything
to numbers.

24:49.355 --> 24:50.654
Well, he's not wrong.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.122
When we talk about
connecting with someone,

24:52.158 --> 24:53.290
all we really mean

24:53.326 --> 24:54.258
is that
their neural biochemistry

24:54.293 --> 24:56.727
in some way influences
our neural biochemistry,

24:56.762 --> 25:00.231
resulting in a reaction
that people call love.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.934
Have you ever been in love,
Mr. Hodkins?

25:03.970 --> 25:06.270
As a matter of fact,
I have a girlfriend.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.272
Her name is Susan.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.375
Well, are you
in love with Susan?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.578
We're in a relationship.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.748
Well, it just sounds more like
a science experiment to me.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.083
Are you sure that she's happy?

25:28.961 --> 25:30.661
It's cold out here.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.929
Do you want a blanket?

25:31.964 --> 25:33.063
Sure, thanks.

25:38.571 --> 25:39.503
S'mores?

25:39.539 --> 25:40.638
You wanna try one?

25:40.673 --> 25:43.674
I told you,
I don't do sugar.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.277
I promise I won't
tell anybody.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.345
All right.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.019
You know...

25:55.054 --> 25:55.886
It's actually pretty good.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.623
Didn't you ever
have a campfire

25:59.659 --> 26:01.892
as a kid?

26:01.928 --> 26:03.994
I'm fairly certain
it was against the law

26:04.030 --> 26:05.329
in my apartment building.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.498
Every summer,

26:07.533 --> 26:10.334
my parents and I would
go camping for a week,

26:10.369 --> 26:14.371
it was the most fun
that we'd have all year.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.973
Actually, it was kind of

26:16.008 --> 26:18.842
the only fun that
we would have all year.

26:18.878 --> 26:19.843
It was that bad?

26:19.879 --> 26:21.178
Almost.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.713
They're both accountants,

26:22.748 --> 26:24.381
so they do everything
by the book.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.984
And that's why you don't?

26:27.019 --> 26:29.353
Don't get me wrong,
I love my parents.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.355
But...?

26:31.390 --> 26:34.558
But... I don't want
to turn into them.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.993
Some people say

26:36.028 --> 26:37.561
that we all turn into
our parents eventually.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.662
Thanks.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.997
I feel so much
better now...

26:40.032 --> 26:41.432
I said
"some people,"

26:41.467 --> 26:42.700
some people...

26:46.238 --> 26:47.037
You know, I think

26:47.073 --> 26:49.206
it's more like being
on the water.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.342
Your parents,
they give you a boat.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.612
It might be a raft,
it might be a yacht,

26:54.647 --> 26:56.780
but it's up to you to decide
where you're going to steer it.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.716
What if we don't know
where we want to go?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.217
I think, deep down,

27:00.252 --> 27:02.453
most people know
where they want to go.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.421
They're just afraid to admit it.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.524
I'm sorry for
that crack that I made

27:07.560 --> 27:09.226
about you and your girlfriend.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.628
It wasn't fair.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.029
I apologize.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.399
Apology accepted.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.771
The truth is,
you might not be too wrong.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.942
How your parents
did everything by-the-book,

27:24.977 --> 27:27.244
mine, they...
They didn't even read it.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.815
I guess I was drawn
to psychology

27:31.851 --> 27:34.618
as a way of finding
answers to the questions

27:34.654 --> 27:36.854
I always wanted to ask them.

27:48.177 --> 27:51.335
Who knew a baby shower
would take so much organizing?

27:51.370 --> 27:52.903
How am I going to fit
all these people

27:52.938 --> 27:54.171
into our little house?

27:54.206 --> 27:55.939
I'm just so happy
for you both.

27:55.975 --> 27:56.940
I mean, wild Rose.

27:56.976 --> 27:57.741
Who would have thought?

27:57.777 --> 27:59.610
I know, right?

27:59.645 --> 28:01.478
It had been on both
of our minds for a while,

28:01.514 --> 28:02.646
and then Kenny got a new job,

28:02.682 --> 28:04.982
and we bought
the place,

28:05.017 --> 28:07.084
so... the timing
just made sense.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.586
This is not the Rose
that I remember from college.

28:09.622 --> 28:11.422
We never used to plan
anything.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.956
Yeah.

28:12.992 --> 28:16.160
I just got tired
of never knowing what's next.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.494
What about our theme song?

28:17.530 --> 28:18.929
"Que sera sera"?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.666
I guess I just finally
figured out what I want.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.870
I wish I could do that.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.706
I just...

28:28.741 --> 28:31.108
I don't know, I don't see myself
settling down any time soon.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.176
Trust me,

28:32.211 --> 28:33.711
when you meet the right guy,

28:33.746 --> 28:36.780
it's not going to feel like
you're settling down at all.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.681
It's gonna feel like

28:37.717 --> 28:39.616
you're starting
the biggest adventure

28:39.652 --> 28:41.051
of your life.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.619
Balloons!

28:42.655 --> 28:44.555
I forgot the balloons!

30:38.470 --> 30:40.070
Seriously?

30:41.841 --> 30:44.441
Hi, Susan!

30:44.476 --> 30:46.143
<i>Spencer, where were you?</i>

30:46.178 --> 30:47.911
Just getting some fresh air.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.046
<i>Be careful.</i>

30:49.081 --> 30:50.280
<i>There's a lot of pollen
this time of year.</i>

30:50.316 --> 30:51.949
Of course.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.283
<i>Is the old man gone yet?</i>

30:54.486 --> 30:57.087
<i>The old man and his dog?</i>

30:57.122 --> 30:58.121
Yeah, right.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.857
Gone.
Place is empty.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.124
Just me.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.459
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

31:02.494 --> 31:03.760
<i>You don't need
any distractions.</i>

31:03.796 --> 31:05.429
Absolutely.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.330
<i>How's it going?</i>

31:07.466 --> 31:08.999
<i>Your paper.</i>

31:09.034 --> 31:11.468
<i>How's it going?</i>

31:11.503 --> 31:13.170
Yeah, great, fine, good.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.005
It's... it's coming along.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.907
<i>I can't wait to read it.</i>

31:18.143 --> 31:19.943
Susan?

31:19.979 --> 31:20.911
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:22.314 --> 31:24.114
Are you happy?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.849
<i>What do you mean?</i>

31:25.885 --> 31:27.784
Are you happy, with us?

31:27.820 --> 31:29.453
With me?

31:30.823 --> 31:32.456
<i>Don't be ridiculous, Spencer.</i>

31:32.491 --> 31:35.125
<i>I've got to go.</i>

31:35.160 --> 31:36.793
<i>I've got that fundraiser.
I'll call you later?</i>

31:36.829 --> 31:37.895
Okay.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.329
Love...

31:39.365 --> 31:41.331
You.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.703
Stop looking at me like that.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.507
There's no reason
for Susan to find out,

31:50.542 --> 31:51.842
and it's not like
we're doing anything wrong.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.556
Come on.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.734
Can I help you?

32:50.769 --> 32:52.436
Ellen.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.237
Laura, hello!

32:54.273 --> 32:55.439
Do you work here?

32:55.474 --> 32:57.040
More or less.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.375
I own the place.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.876
This too?

32:59.912 --> 33:02.746
And a couple of other spots
in South Haven.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.248
My husband was
a very smart investor.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.883
But he loved this gallery,

33:06.919 --> 33:10.220
so I keep it up
as best I can.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.923
Now, I am so sorry
about the rental situation.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.058
Have you decided
what you're going to do?

33:15.094 --> 33:16.326
There's nothing else
available in town,

33:16.362 --> 33:17.661
so we're staying put.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.896
Well, that is wonderful,

33:19.932 --> 33:21.932
and if it helps any,

33:21.967 --> 33:23.567
I'm going to return
half the rental fee

33:23.602 --> 33:25.402
to both of you.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.770
Thank you.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.672
It's the least I can do.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.507
You're a photographer.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.776
No, not at all,
I just take pictures.

33:32.811 --> 33:33.944
You choose your frame,

33:33.979 --> 33:35.512
you choose your lens,

33:35.547 --> 33:36.747
you're a photographer.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.582
May I?

33:38.617 --> 33:40.117
No, I don't...
I don't show anyone.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.318
It's just for me.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.619
None of that,
not in here.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.655
This is a sacred place.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.457
All art is safe
within these walls.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.264
Okay.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.436
Thank you.

34:07.146 --> 34:10.179
A little Adams.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.549
Maybe some
Imogen Cunningham.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.052
You don't,
photograph people?

34:15.087 --> 34:17.353
No, I would be way
too embarrassed to even try.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.822
That's too personal.

34:18.857 --> 34:19.822
Nonsense.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.958
The human face is
the greatest subject of all.

34:26.532 --> 34:27.964
You have an eye.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.565
I do?

34:30.469 --> 34:31.868
My husband and I
made it our mission

34:31.904 --> 34:33.402
to encourage young artists.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.504
I'm...

34:34.540 --> 34:35.839
I'm trying to carry it on,

34:35.873 --> 34:37.340
but it's not so easy these days.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.676
Hey...

34:39.710 --> 34:40.877
Maybe you'd like
to help me?

34:40.913 --> 34:42.545
Excuse me?

34:42.581 --> 34:43.914
Here at the gallery.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.049
There is so much
you could do.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.652
Catalog,
arrange things,

34:48.687 --> 34:49.886
and in return,

34:49.922 --> 34:51.721
I would teach you
everything I've learned.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.824
We could even study the great
photographers together.

34:54.860 --> 34:55.859
Arbus.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.094
Cartier-Bresson.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.728
Maybe throw in a little warhol

34:58.764 --> 35:00.097
for some fun.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.264
Thank you.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.866
I just, I'm only
here for two weeks.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.267
Absolutely perfect.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.937
The South Haven Art Fair
is two weeks away.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.071
I have a big show
that weekend,

35:08.107 --> 35:10.073
and I could use some help.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.243
Can I think about it?

35:13.278 --> 35:14.711
Of course.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.784
You have a talent, Laura.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.053
It would be a shame
to see it go to waste.

35:37.836 --> 35:38.735
No! Frank!

35:43.342 --> 35:45.809
I think Frank might be
getting used to her.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.077
Good.

35:47.112 --> 35:47.978
Because I've come up
with a solution

35:48.013 --> 35:49.246
to our living situation.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.247
You have?

35:51.583 --> 35:52.849
Right over here.

35:57.289 --> 36:00.891
"Treaty for living
under the same roof."

36:00.926 --> 36:02.225
I thought, since
we had to compromise,

36:02.261 --> 36:04.794
we might as well
set some ground rules.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.765
"Music shall only be played
in the common areas

36:08.800 --> 36:11.568
"between the hours
of 7:00 A.M. and 9:00 P.M.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.304
And at a sound level
of 60 decibels or less."

36:14.339 --> 36:16.306
I measured the volume
on your speakers.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.440
It was 88.

36:19.144 --> 36:21.111
"Pet access to the common areas
will be on a strict rotation,

36:21.146 --> 36:24.114
"with feline activity
limited to even hours

36:24.149 --> 36:26.583
and canine activity
during odd hours."

36:26.618 --> 36:27.951
I thought that was perfectly
reasonable, don't you?

36:29.154 --> 36:30.921
"Residents may occupy bathroom

36:30.956 --> 36:32.789
"a maximum
of three times per day,

36:32.824 --> 36:34.024
"with a limit of 20 minutes

36:34.059 --> 36:35.125
per usage."

36:35.160 --> 36:36.326
One more thing.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.964
"Two towels maximum."

36:44.169 --> 36:45.969
Yeah? No?

36:46.004 --> 36:47.103
And I forgot.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.307
And to make things easier...

36:53.979 --> 36:55.512
Half for you,

36:55.547 --> 36:56.479
and half for me.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.955
So, what do you think?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.232
Time!

38:34.146 --> 38:35.879
Hi.

38:39.284 --> 38:41.484
So this guy actually
made a list of rules

38:41.520 --> 38:42.919
he expects you
to follow?

38:42.954 --> 38:45.455
Yeah, right down
to the towels.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.757
Can't you just kick him out?

38:47.793 --> 38:48.758
No, he signed the papers.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.728
He has just as much right
to be there as I do.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.797
Well, you are
welcome to stay here

38:53.832 --> 38:55.131
for as long
as you want.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.733
Thank you.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.101
Thank you, guys,
for everything.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.502
Now, please go to sleep.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.304
I don't want you to do
anything else.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.505
Please, go.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.606
Goodnight.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.941
Goodnight.
Thank you.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.610
Come here, Frank.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.780
Come on.
Sit, sit, sit.

39:15.287 --> 39:17.287
Yeah.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.788
This is more like it?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.991
This is more like it,
Mozart?

39:22.027 --> 39:25.462
Finally, some peace and quiet.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.304
I am going to get
a lot of work done.

39:35.507 --> 39:39.275
Lots of work.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.448
A lotta work.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.859
What?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.228
It wasn't my fault.

39:58.263 --> 39:59.362
It was her choice to leave.

39:59.398 --> 40:00.964
That's what she wanted.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
Besides,

40:03.034 --> 40:05.168
it's not a good idea to have
somebody like her

40:05.203 --> 40:07.704
when you're trying to do work...

40:08.940 --> 40:11.174
Tossing her hair all the time,

40:11.209 --> 40:14.010
walking around the house,

40:14.045 --> 40:16.179
being all cute.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.659
This is better,
isn't it, Frank?

40:29.694 --> 40:32.028
Just you and me.

40:32.063 --> 40:35.732
No one telling us to be quiet
all the time,

40:35.767 --> 40:40.837
drinking that weird stuff
that he always drinks,

40:40.872 --> 40:43.673
waking up
first thing in the morning

40:43.708 --> 40:44.674
to do his sit-ups.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.943
I know.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.179
With his...

40:49.214 --> 40:50.880
Abs all...

40:53.885 --> 40:55.218
Like that.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.224
Yeah, well.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.226
Goodnight, Frank.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.628
You're no help.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.031
You have to move.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.365
No...

41:09.401 --> 41:11.234
No, no, no, okay.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.035
No, Frank, this is...

41:13.405 --> 41:15.138
No, this...

41:15.173 --> 41:17.574
Okay...

41:17.609 --> 41:18.808
Frank, I can't...

41:34.326 --> 41:37.026
I'm up, I'm up...

41:39.130 --> 41:40.096
Hey.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.097
Hi.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.599
You must be Laura, right?

41:43.869 --> 41:44.801
Cool.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.269
Well, I'm Tyler.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.904
A friend of Kenny's.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.808
I'm here for breakfast.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.043
Come on in, Tyler.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.147
Some of the most
insane verticals

41:58.183 --> 41:59.315
you have ever seen.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.384
It sounds amazing.

42:02.821 --> 42:03.920
Cute, isn't he?

42:04.956 --> 42:05.922
Yeah, I guess.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.457
You guess?

42:07.492 --> 42:09.659
Come on, Laura, he's adorable.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.661
Maybe you guys should
go out sometime?

42:11.696 --> 42:12.662
I'm just not
really interested

42:12.697 --> 42:13.763
in dating right now.

42:13.798 --> 42:16.132
Are you really going to let
that thing with David

42:16.167 --> 42:17.934
stop you from meeting
the right guy?

42:17.969 --> 42:20.303
You really think
that this is the right guy?

42:20.338 --> 42:21.938
I don't know,

42:21.973 --> 42:24.374
but neither will you
if you don't take a chance.

42:24.409 --> 42:27.277
Whatever happened
to the old Laura?

42:27.312 --> 42:29.679
"Que sera sera"?

42:35.520 --> 42:37.153
So, Kenny says

42:37.188 --> 42:39.222
you've got a crazy
cat guy at your house.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.324
He's not crazy,
he's just...

42:41.359 --> 42:42.392
Sensitive.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.860
He doesn't like loud music,

42:43.895 --> 42:45.128
and he doesn't let her
use the shower

42:45.163 --> 42:46.062
when she wants.

42:46.865 --> 42:47.997
You gotta get rid of this guy.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.566
No, it's not that easy.

42:49.601 --> 42:51.034
He's got a contract.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.201
Maybe you need
to convince him

42:52.237 --> 42:53.536
to break it?

42:53.572 --> 42:55.071
And how do you suggest
I do that?

42:55.106 --> 42:56.539
Well...

42:56.575 --> 42:59.309
Figure out exactly
what bothers him,

42:59.344 --> 43:01.811
and then do it, a lot.

43:02.847 --> 43:03.780
Laura...

43:03.815 --> 43:07.216
How would you like to host
my baby shower?

43:08.720 --> 43:11.387
Okay...

43:32.877 --> 43:34.043
Hey, honey.

43:34.079 --> 43:36.012
<i>Spencer, are you all right?</i>

43:36.047 --> 43:37.680
Yeah, I just went for a run.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.282
<i>There's a gym
in that little town?</i>

43:39.317 --> 43:40.950
No, I went for a run
on the beach.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.452
<i>Outside?</i>

43:42.487 --> 43:44.187
Yeah, you should see
this place, it's so beautiful...

43:44.222 --> 43:45.188
<i>Spencer...</i>

43:45.223 --> 43:46.389
<i>It sounds to me</i>

43:46.424 --> 43:47.624
<i>like you're not actually
getting any work done.</i>

43:47.659 --> 43:48.658
That is not true.

43:48.693 --> 43:51.027
In fact, I'm on the verge
of major breakthrough.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.028
<i>I hope so.</i>

43:52.063 --> 43:53.062
Don't worry,

43:53.098 --> 43:54.230
there's absolutely nothing

43:54.265 --> 43:57.233
that's going to stand between me
and finishing my paper.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.435
My gosh, it's adorable!
Thank you!

44:02.507 --> 44:04.207
Susan, I'm going
to have to call you back.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.076
Hello?

44:07.112 --> 44:08.578
Excuse me?

44:08.613 --> 44:09.579
Hi.

44:09.614 --> 44:10.680
Excuse me.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.148
-Hello.
-Rose...

44:12.183 --> 44:13.016
You didn't tell us

44:13.051 --> 44:14.884
there was going to be
entertainment.

44:16.187 --> 44:18.187
Spencer,
you're home early.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.690
Apparently.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.258
Sorry to interrupt, ladies.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.693
May I speak with you
in the kitchen, please?

44:23.728 --> 44:24.594
Sure.

44:24.629 --> 44:25.795
Thanks.

44:28.033 --> 44:29.032
I thought you said

44:29.067 --> 44:29.866
you were going to be
staying with your friends?

44:29.901 --> 44:31.167
Yeah, well, it didn't
really work out,

44:31.202 --> 44:32.201
so I came back.

44:32.237 --> 44:33.569
I can see that.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.371
What's with all this?

44:35.407 --> 44:37.373
It's Rose's baby shower.

44:38.410 --> 44:39.509
Why is it
happening here?

44:39.544 --> 44:40.610
Well, it was the only place
that I could fit everybody.

44:40.645 --> 44:43.079
And you didn't bother
telling me this because...?

44:43.114 --> 44:44.213
Well, you're so busy
with your paper,

44:44.249 --> 44:45.615
I didn't want
to disturb you,

44:45.650 --> 44:47.417
and I know
how sensitive you are.

44:53.091 --> 44:54.490
Bye!

44:57.295 --> 45:00.063
"I just know
how sensitive you are..."

45:07.405 --> 45:08.571
No, Mozart...

45:08.606 --> 45:09.605
No, no, no.

45:09.641 --> 45:10.773
No, no, no, don't...

45:10.809 --> 45:12.275
Frank!

45:22.353 --> 45:24.620
No. Mozart.
Come on. Here, kitty.

45:24.656 --> 45:26.122
Frank!

45:26.157 --> 45:27.256
Come back over here!

45:27.292 --> 45:28.224
-Stop.
-Mozart!

45:28.259 --> 45:29.892
Frank!

45:31.129 --> 45:32.829
Here. Kitty.
Here, kitty. Come on.

45:32.864 --> 45:33.930
Come on.
Not the notes!

45:35.100 --> 45:36.432
Mozart! my notes!

45:38.636 --> 45:40.269
No!

45:40.305 --> 45:41.471
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!

45:56.454 --> 45:58.287
Oops.

45:58.323 --> 46:00.022
Bye.
Thank you.

46:00.058 --> 46:01.824
Thank you.
Lovely party.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.326
Thanks.
Thanks, guys.

46:04.295 --> 46:05.795
Bye.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.764
Yeah.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.799
You didn't tell me
he was so cute.

46:09.834 --> 46:10.967
Goodbye, Rose.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.511
Spencer,
I'm so sorry.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.279
It's okay.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.515
It was just
an old record anyhow.

46:30.922 --> 46:33.356
Is there anything
that I can do?

46:34.726 --> 46:35.591
I think you've done enough.

46:35.627 --> 46:38.327
No, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

46:39.531 --> 46:42.231
Of course you didn't.

46:42.267 --> 46:44.300
I just can't believe
you'd be so disrespectful.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.803
We agreed to share this house,
and now look at it.

46:46.838 --> 46:49.906
No, all we have to do
is keep Frank and Mozart apart.

46:49.941 --> 46:52.008
That's not going to be
a problem anymore,

46:52.043 --> 46:53.476
because I'm leaving,

46:53.511 --> 46:56.212
and I'm taking
my cat with me.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.246
Here, Mozart.

46:57.282 --> 46:58.214
Here, kitty,
kitty...

46:58.249 --> 46:59.816
-What?
-come on.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.851
No, come on,
you don't have to leave.

47:03.421 --> 47:04.353
Moz!

47:04.389 --> 47:05.488
Mozart!

47:05.523 --> 47:06.923
Come on, Mozart!

47:06.958 --> 47:08.524
Spencer, we can work this out.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.592
Why would we?

47:09.627 --> 47:11.360
You hate planning,
I hate surprises.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.763
We're not a perfect match.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.898
There's nothing left
in South Haven,

47:15.934 --> 47:17.567
we already tried.

47:17.602 --> 47:20.069
Where are you going to go?

47:20.104 --> 47:23.673
As far away from...

47:23.708 --> 47:25.775
This house as I can.

47:25.810 --> 47:28.010
Mozart! Furball! Come on!

47:30.415 --> 47:33.015
I think I know where she is.

47:37.622 --> 47:39.355
I don't believe it.

47:39.390 --> 47:40.423
Well, at least

47:40.458 --> 47:42.191
they're getting along.

47:44.462 --> 47:45.928
That cake really did
go everywhere?

47:47.632 --> 47:50.199
Poor Mrs. Woods
and the champagne.

47:55.340 --> 47:56.873
It was really quiet
around here last night

47:56.908 --> 47:58.207
with you gone.

47:59.344 --> 48:01.711
You must have enjoyed that.

48:03.681 --> 48:06.749
No, actually,
I didn't.

48:06.784 --> 48:08.551
I know it's wrong,

48:08.586 --> 48:10.987
and I shouldn't be
feeling this way,

48:11.022 --> 48:12.989
but...

48:13.024 --> 48:14.924
I really missed you.

48:18.997 --> 48:21.230
I missed you, too.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.233
Are you really
going to leave?

48:26.938 --> 48:28.771
Laura...

48:30.341 --> 48:31.540
I'll get it.

48:39.717 --> 48:41.384
What?

48:48.793 --> 48:50.993
Hi.

48:51.029 --> 48:52.528
There must be
some sort of mistake,

48:52.563 --> 48:54.597
I didn't order any pizza.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.132
I did.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.101
Thanks.
Keep the change.

48:59.137 --> 49:00.836
You ordered pizza?

49:00.872 --> 49:02.805
I thought you were
eating raw?

49:02.840 --> 49:05.841
Well, maybe it's time

49:05.877 --> 49:08.644
I started trying to do things
a little differently.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.783
You wanna share it with me?

49:15.486 --> 49:16.352
On one condition.

49:18.690 --> 49:20.323
Can we make it three towels

49:20.358 --> 49:22.224
instead of two?

49:22.260 --> 49:23.292
Okay.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.128
Three towels.

49:29.767 --> 49:31.567
Now, these
are part of the series

49:31.602 --> 49:34.637
that the photographer did
in one day,

49:34.672 --> 49:36.672
telling the story
of a single flower

49:36.708 --> 49:39.008
from dawn until dusk.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.876
Excuse me.

49:40.912 --> 49:43.179
Laura, it's so good
to see you.

49:43.214 --> 49:44.714
I hope everything's
still okay at the house.

49:44.749 --> 49:45.881
It's just amazing.

49:45.917 --> 49:47.016
And Spencer?

49:47.051 --> 49:47.917
No, we're loving it,

49:47.952 --> 49:50.086
but, Ellen, I just
wanted to ask you if...

49:50.121 --> 49:51.354
Yes.

49:51.389 --> 49:53.356
The offer still stands.

49:55.226 --> 49:57.493
And this is our
new artist gallery.

49:57.528 --> 49:59.061
Every year,
I dedicate this space

49:59.097 --> 50:01.063
to a young,
emerging photographer

50:01.099 --> 50:03.232
who shows real
artistic promise,

50:03.267 --> 50:04.867
and you, Laura...

50:04.902 --> 50:06.502
Are going to paint it.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.540
Man, no idea.

50:44.575 --> 50:46.442
Ice cream.

50:46.477 --> 50:49.078
Watch out for that.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.330
What?

51:44.068 --> 51:45.468
But Ansel Adams started

51:45.503 --> 51:46.869
with the feeling that
he was trying to convey,

51:46.904 --> 51:48.637
and then chose
his subjects, which...

51:48.673 --> 51:50.172
I'm babbling,
aren't I?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.373
No, I love hearing you

51:51.409 --> 51:52.508
get so excited
about something.

51:52.543 --> 51:53.943
Have you ever thought about
doing it professionally?

51:53.978 --> 51:55.778
Are you kidding?
My parents would kill...

51:59.684 --> 52:01.617
Sorry about that.

52:23.741 --> 52:26.842
It's not going to paint itself.

53:08.085 --> 53:11.420
It's your first portrait.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.589
It's good.

53:14.725 --> 53:17.159
It's very good.

53:50.094 --> 53:52.061
Look here, Frank.

54:00.671 --> 54:01.804
No peeking.

54:01.839 --> 54:02.771
Don't look.

54:02.807 --> 54:03.939
I'm not, I'm not...

54:03.975 --> 54:05.374
Okay, step, step...

54:08.279 --> 54:10.079
Open.

54:10.114 --> 54:11.313
What?

54:11.349 --> 54:13.249
Where did you...
How did you...

54:13.284 --> 54:14.917
Do you like it?

54:14.952 --> 54:16.285
Are you kidding me?

54:16.320 --> 54:19.021
I love it.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.223
Thank you.

54:22.393 --> 54:23.792
I've got to
try it out right now.

54:23.828 --> 54:24.760
Try it.

54:24.795 --> 54:25.661
I am.

54:28.899 --> 54:30.466
This is perfect.

54:31.502 --> 54:32.835
I can't believe

54:32.870 --> 54:33.769
you got me another
record player.

54:44.315 --> 54:45.681
Can you hear that?

54:45.716 --> 54:47.116
You don't just
hear the music.

54:47.151 --> 54:49.118
You can hear
their heartbeats.

54:59.230 --> 55:00.462
Spencer, I...

55:00.498 --> 55:01.630
Yes... yes.

55:01.666 --> 55:02.498
Okay.

55:49.880 --> 55:50.813
Laura?

55:52.383 --> 55:53.615
Hello?

55:53.651 --> 55:55.851
She went to
the cafe for lunch.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.353
She's been working
very hard this morning,

55:57.388 --> 55:58.454
she deserved it.

55:58.489 --> 55:59.788
Well, great, thanks.

56:00.725 --> 56:03.125
I hope that everything's
okay at the house?

56:03.160 --> 56:04.693
Yeah, everything is...

56:04.729 --> 56:05.961
It's great.

56:05.996 --> 56:07.730
I really am sorry
about the mix-up,

56:07.765 --> 56:09.298
with the bookings.

56:09.333 --> 56:10.165
Are you kidding me?

56:10.201 --> 56:11.533
This has been
one of the best things

56:11.569 --> 56:13.302
that has ever
happened to me.

56:32.590 --> 56:34.556
-Hey!
-Hi!

56:34.592 --> 56:36.125
I'm not bothering you, am I?

56:36.160 --> 56:37.793
No. no, no,
of course not.

56:37.828 --> 56:38.827
But what's wrong?

56:38.863 --> 56:39.828
Nothing.

56:39.864 --> 56:41.130
Everything is very right.

56:42.166 --> 56:43.766
I'm done.

56:43.801 --> 56:44.767
"The Chemistry of Love"
is complete.

56:44.802 --> 56:46.301
What?

56:46.337 --> 56:47.903
Spencer,
that is fantastic.

56:47.938 --> 56:48.971
Congratulations.

56:49.006 --> 56:50.105
Thank you.
Thank you, yeah.

56:50.141 --> 56:51.407
I couldn't have gotten here

56:51.442 --> 56:52.441
without your help.

56:52.476 --> 56:53.242
You're just
being nice.

56:53.277 --> 56:54.743
Well, you are going
to be paying

56:54.779 --> 56:55.811
for the champagne, so...

56:55.846 --> 56:56.779
Okay, I can do that.

56:56.814 --> 56:57.746
Hey!

56:57.782 --> 56:59.281
Laura, right?

56:59.316 --> 57:00.349
Right.

57:00.384 --> 57:01.450
We're sitting at the patio,

57:01.485 --> 57:02.484
and I thought that was you.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.153
Remember me?

57:04.188 --> 57:05.854
Tyler! Friend
of Kenny and Rose's.

57:05.890 --> 57:06.989
Tyler.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.624
Spencer.
Nice to meet you...

57:08.659 --> 57:12.294
Hey, so did you finally
get rid of that cat guy?

57:12.329 --> 57:13.328
Cat guy?

57:13.364 --> 57:15.097
Yeah, remember?

57:15.132 --> 57:16.331
You were going to do
the baby shower thing.

57:20.337 --> 57:22.104
It was great seeing you, Tyler.

57:22.139 --> 57:23.772
Yeah.

57:23.808 --> 57:25.441
Maybe we can
get a drink sometime?

57:26.844 --> 57:28.010
Nice to meet you, Sandy.

57:29.346 --> 57:30.946
It's not even...

57:30.981 --> 57:32.681
I promise you,
Spencer, it's...

57:32.716 --> 57:34.983
Gosh.

57:35.019 --> 57:36.251
Spencer... Spencer!

57:37.822 --> 57:39.855
Spencer!

57:39.890 --> 57:41.023
Spencer, wait!

57:41.058 --> 57:42.524
The baby shower
was a setup.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.226
You did it deliberately
to mess with me.

57:44.261 --> 57:45.294
Why?

57:45.329 --> 57:46.361
Because...

57:46.397 --> 57:47.963
Because you wanted me out?

57:47.998 --> 57:50.666
No, I thought
you hated me.

57:52.369 --> 57:54.303
Hated you?

57:54.338 --> 57:55.737
No.

57:55.773 --> 57:57.706
I don't hate you. I...

57:57.741 --> 57:59.007
I never did.

57:59.043 --> 58:00.909
I just, it was something
that I told myself.

58:00.945 --> 58:03.245
Why?

58:03.280 --> 58:04.613
So I wouldn't do this.

58:12.756 --> 58:15.491
Spencer, we shouldn't...

58:16.727 --> 58:18.327
I'm sorry.

58:18.362 --> 58:19.828
I'm so sorry.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.714
[Needle hiss

58:43.487 --> 58:44.620
hi, Frank!

58:44.655 --> 58:45.621
I brought you a treat.

58:45.656 --> 58:46.922
Yeah?

58:48.792 --> 58:50.425
Spencer?

58:50.461 --> 58:52.261
You home?

59:28.566 --> 59:30.632
It's cold out here.

59:30.668 --> 59:33.969
You want a blanket
or something?

59:34.004 --> 59:35.003
Yeah.

59:35.039 --> 59:36.705
Thanks.

59:42.746 --> 59:45.547
You make this look
a lot easier than it is.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.149
I can hardly
get the marshmallow

59:47.184 --> 59:48.216
to stay on the stick.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.851
Well, it comes
with practice.

59:49.887 --> 59:50.886
Here.

59:50.921 --> 59:54.523
I still can't believe
you never did this as a kid.

59:56.560 --> 59:59.194
I told you,
my parents didn't exactly

59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.164
do things by the book.

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:04.533
I guess that's why I am
the way that I am.

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:08.070
It's not so bad,

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.372
the way you are.

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:17.279
My mom and dad,
they traveled a lot,

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.847
for work.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.084
They were
in the peace corps.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.119
I didn't get to see them
that often,

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.622
but they were always
laughing and smiling,

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.257
and having all kinds of fun.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.560
They must really
enjoy their lives.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.663
They really did.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.935
When I was about 12,

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.472
my mom, she got pretty sick.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:46.375
It all happened pretty fast,
and then...

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.710
She was gone.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.979
I'm sorry.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.714
It was like

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.784
someone turned off a light
inside of my dad

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.286
and I just watched him
fade away over the years,

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.422
and then...

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:02.391
Then he was gone, too.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.627
Spencer...

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:06.662
The doctors,

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:08.030
they said he had
a weak heart, but...

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.035
I just think that it was broken.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.440
Is that why you did this?

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.878
"The Chemistry of Love."

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.914
Yeah.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.920
I just thought
if I could find

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:36.024
some rational,
biological reason

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.528
behind the feelings of love,
and loss, and...

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:41.897
It might not happen again?

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.766
Yeah.

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:49.471
And then I met you,

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:52.340
and then for the first time,

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.877
I realized it's not just
a series of chemical reactions.

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:58.947
It's something so much more,

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:01.817
and it's real.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.522
Great.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.658
Just great.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.461
I mean, there's
more marshmallows...

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:14.796
No, it's not about
the marshmallows, Spencer.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.066
I don't like commitment, okay?

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:20.135
Whenever somebody
gets too serious,

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.003
I take a hike.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.407
And you know why?

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:27.375
Why?

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.311
My parents.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.346
They're divorced?

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.481
No, are you kidding?

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.282
They've been married
for 30 years.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:37.219
I'm sorry, I don't
think I understand...

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.653
No, do you realize
the kind of pressure

01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:40.455
that that puts on me?

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.159
Yeah, you don't want
to become your parents...

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:45.127
No...

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:49.498
It's not that I don't
want to become them,

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:53.068
it's that I don't think
that I can live up to them.

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:56.872
I'm afraid to even try.

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:03.011
Till you.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.679
Laura...

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:05.781
You have a commitment,

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:08.450
you have a girlfriend,

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:10.452
and I won't be the person

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.455
to come in between
you and Susan.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.689
I won't.

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:15.657
Goodnight.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.620
Do you want
a piece of advice, Frank?

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:47.122
Never fall in love

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.291
with someone
that has a girlfriend.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:03:59.801
What?

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:06.575
Fi made a mistake.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.809
I admit it, okay?

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.644
Are you just going
to sit there

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.879
judging me all night?

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.150
What if I get you tuna?

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:38.139
Okay, now you can judge me.

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:50.952
Frank, I'm up, I'm up,

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.120
I'm up...

01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:09.871
Spencer!

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:15.977
You sleep in?

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.281
Well, you snooze, you lose.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.034
Goodbye.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.602
Good...

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.103
Goodbye.

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:44.940
Goodbyes are hard.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:48.076
Goodbyes are...

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.745
Goodbyes are not easy, and...

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.783
I don't like saying goodbyes,

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:56.851
but I wanted you to know

01:05:56.887 --> 01:05:58.586
that I will always remember
our time here together

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.355
at this... at this house?

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:05.393
I just want you to know
that you've changed my life.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.965
I want you to know that...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.434
I don't want to say goodbye.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.636
To who, Spencer?

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:15.770
Susan?

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:17.205
Hi!

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.206
Susan!

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:22.043
I rang, but no one answered.

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.812
Who were you talking to?

01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:24.813
Nobody.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:25.947
Myself.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.248
I was working
on my presentation.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.252
So good to see you.
What are you doing here?

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:33.121
I called you last night.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:34.556
Didn't you get my message?

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.423
No...

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.392
I'm sorry,
I must have been sleeping.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:38.927
I...

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:40.228
Well, that would explain

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:41.496
why you weren't
at the train station.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.630
I hadn't heard from you
in two days,

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.566
and I was starting to worry
that something was wrong.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:45.734
I thought I'd...

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.769
Come and see
how things were going.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:48.970
Everything is...

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.572
They're going great.
I finished it.

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:54.242
That's so amazing!

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:55.343
Thank you.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.344
Congratulations, Spencer.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.347
That means we can spend
some time together.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:00.582
This place
is really lovely.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.951
Where are you going?

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:04.786
I was going to go look around,
is that okay?

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:05.653
Of course.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.188
Of course, it is, yes.

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:09.090
It's just
a bit of a mess in there.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.325
I'm sure I've seen worse.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.863
Spencer,

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:19.267
I'm, surprised
you like this place.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.069
It's not really you.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:23.138
At all.

01:07:24.975 --> 01:07:25.874
Stay.

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:29.277
Stay... in here

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:31.312
and just relax.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.281
I'm going to go get Mozart.

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:35.150
Just, she missed you,
a lot.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.185
Okay.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.459
Laura!

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:46.661
Laura!

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:48.163
Where are you?

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.864
Laura!

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.373
Really?

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.508
Hello, Mozart.

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:02.744
Spencer, she's down here!

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:07.182
It looks like your daddy
has been a very bad boy.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:24.799
Pizza, Spencer? Really?

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.336
Hello.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:30.371
And who are you?

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:34.843
Laura!

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.712
Laura, stay in there,
don't come out.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.680
Do not come out.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.015
Spencer?

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.053
There's a dog in the house.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.854
Yes, the dog.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:49.924
What's it doing in here?

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.959
Whose is it?

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.993
All yours!

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.769
It's a funny story,
really, it...

01:09:10.113 --> 01:09:11.379
I'm so sorry,
Spencer.

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.346
I tried to explain
the mix-up, but...

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.048
It's my fault.

01:09:14.084 --> 01:09:16.718
I should have told her
from the beginning.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.920
Why didn't you?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:23.358
I don't know, I...

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.059
I guess I just

01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:28.863
probably didn't want
to admit it to myself.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:31.533
Anyway,...

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:35.236
It's been a very
interesting two weeks.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.944
I'll never forget...

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.913
You.

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:06.901
Come on, Frank.

01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:18.513
Say goodbye, Frank.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.252
Well, we're just
going to make it.

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:32.253
Hey, I didn't have breakfast,

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:33.221
I'm just going to grab
something real quick.

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.491
Pizza? Seriously?

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:38.860
What? I'm hungry?

01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:57.912
Come on.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.263
Come on, Frank.
Let's go.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.671
So anyway,
we finished the run,

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:57.939
we got back to the chalet,

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:59.474
when we realized

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:01.743
that we'd left Bobby
up on the hill.

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.414
That guy.
I tell ya...

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.749
Hey, Tyler,
can I ask you something?

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:08.950
Yeah, shoot.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.753
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:12.854
Me?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.188
Yeah.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:15.923
I don't even know
where I'm gonna be

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:16.958
in five weeks.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:19.260
But I do know

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:20.828
in five minutes,
I'll buy you another drink.

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:24.499
And cheers.

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.122
Spencer?

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:25.426
Spencer...

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.128
They're ready for you.

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:34.268
Where were you?

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:35.837
Nowhere.

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.572
Right here.

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:32.560
Getting quite a crowd
out there,

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.829
maybe we'd better
open the doors...

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.131
Early.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.033
Ellen, what is this?

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:41.969
I forgot that was in there.

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:47.108
It's my application form
and Spencer's application form,

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:48.476
clipped together.

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:50.478
And there are
a ton of other ones,

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:52.947
all clipped together
as well, in pairs.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.917
What have you been up to?

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:01.155
My husband and I
loved that house,

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.091
and after he left us,

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:07.328
I couldn't bear
to live in it alone,

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.597
but I had promised him

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:12.166
that it would always
be filled with love.

01:16:13.503 --> 01:16:15.136
You do this on purpose.

01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:18.839
You double-book the house

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:21.442
to bring people together,

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:23.177
and that's why
the questionnaires

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:24.445
were so personal.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.481
You're match-making.

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:31.319
It's a little bit sneaky,

01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:32.186
perhaps,

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:34.622
but so far,
it's always worked out.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:36.857
Until now.

01:16:36.893 --> 01:16:39.493
Spring isn't
over yet, dear.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:52.173
Good afternoon,

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:53.240
professors,

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.810
faculty members,

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.812
and distinguished guests.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.749
"The Chemistry of Love.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.585
A study in psychobiology
and human emotion."

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.920
By Spencer Hodkins.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.575
So glad you could
make it, thank you.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:29.577
You see, the artist
is making a statement,

01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:31.979
not only in his use
of light and shadow,

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.849
but also in the depth of focus
that he's chosen.

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.418
Well, I'd say this is
quite the success,

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:38.519
wouldn't you?

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:39.553
Definitely.

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:41.355
But what about the Annex?

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:43.090
People have been asking me
who it is this year.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.661
Well, I guess it's time.

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:49.030
Would you give me
a hand?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.599
Hello?

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:54.168
Everyone, could I have
your attention, please?

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:56.437
Good afternoon,
and welcome

01:17:56.472 --> 01:18:00.274
to the here at
the Davis Gallery.

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.510
Now, every year,

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:04.612
I have to choose
a new photographer to feature

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:06.080
here at the gallery,

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:08.449
someone with a fresh vision

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:10.685
and an original eye
all their own.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.287
And sometimes, it takes
an out-of-towner

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:17.024
to see our little village
in a new way,

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.793
and that's certainly
the case this year.

01:18:18.828 --> 01:18:23.297
It gives me great pleasure
to present to you

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:28.235
the Davis Gallery
emerging artist for this year,

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:30.071
Laura Haley.

01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:40.381
Surprised?

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.882
I can't believe it.

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:43.084
Thank you.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.585
These are my photographs,

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:45.653
in a gallery.

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:47.755
And people
really like them.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.323
Of course they do, dear.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:50.191
They're good.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.127
I don't know how
I could ever thank you.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.730
Well, would you consider
staying on with me?

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:56.764
I could certainly use

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:58.833
someone
of your talent here.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.801
You mean,
stay in South Haven?

01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:03.437
I'm thinking of starting
a school of my own,

01:19:03.473 --> 01:19:05.406
just small at first,
a few classes,

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:06.774
but you never know

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:08.743
where these things
might lead.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:11.178
I don't know...

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:12.346
I realize

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:13.781
that it is quite
a big commitment,

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:16.517
but you just
think it over, okay?

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:17.818
Okay.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:31.932
You made it.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:33.334
Hi!

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:34.335
We're so proud of you.

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:36.670
Thank you.

01:19:36.706 --> 01:19:38.773
It's kind of overwhelming.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.307
So, what now?

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.976
Now I'm going
to tell my parents

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:45.179
that I finally know
what I want to do with my life,

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:46.881
and then I'm going
to tell them I love them,

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.382
and then I'm going to say,
"I quit."

01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:49.283
You're really
going to do that?

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:50.384
Yeah.

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:51.652
You know, they're
going to be angry,

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.354
and there's probably
going to be yelling,

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:55.389
but it's what
I want to do.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:56.957
Well, get ready.

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:57.958
Here comes your chance.

01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:00.127
Mom!

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.896
Dad! Hi!

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.297
What are you guys doing here?

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:05.699
We had a phone call
from a lady who said

01:20:05.735 --> 01:20:07.067
that you were showing
some of your photographs

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:08.803
in her gallery.

01:20:08.838 --> 01:20:10.371
You didn't think
we'd miss

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.139
our daughter's
first big show, did you?

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:34.061
So... what do you think?

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:37.231
It's beautiful,
sweetie.

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:38.999
Very impressed, honey.

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.435
I mean, you've always had
a camera in your hand, but...

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:42.603
Who knew?

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:43.437
Thank you,

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:45.072
both of you.

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:47.274
Mom, dad,

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.943
I have to tell you something...

01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:50.945
Well, actually, honey,

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.813
we have something
to tell you first.

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:56.217
Ed?

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:58.686
Your mother and I,

01:20:58.721 --> 01:20:59.653
we sold the business.

01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:03.090
What?

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:04.859
We're going to take
some time off and travel,

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:06.927
see the world
for a bit.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:09.263
I mean, we put
a little money away for you,

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:11.799
but, I'm afraid,
from now on, honey,

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:13.968
you are on your own.

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:18.873
What did you want to tell us?

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:23.944
Frank!

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.212
Guess what?

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:27.047
I am a photographer.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.983
A real-life photographer.

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:30.751
Come on, let's go for a walk
and celebrate.

01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:37.825
Hello?

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.728
Is somebody here?

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:42.429
I'm renting this house!

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:45.833
Well, there must have been
some sort of mix-up.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.235
What are you doing here?

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:49.036
I thought you had
to present your paper?

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:53.607
I did, and it did
not go very well.

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:55.476
What?
What happened?

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:56.911
They said they felt

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:58.913
that I didn't believe
what I was saying,

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:01.882
so if I wasn't buying it,
why should they?

01:22:03.119 --> 01:22:04.251
So, what are you going to do?

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:07.121
Start over.

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:08.155
Do you know of a place

01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:09.757
where I could stay for a while
and work on it?

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:12.760
What about Susan?

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:14.628
Susan...

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:17.798
Well, I tried to make s'mores
for her in the apartment,

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.533
and I set fire
to the drapes, so...

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:21.435
You're kidding.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:22.803
Actually, I am.

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:25.139
The truth is...

01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:30.444
I'm in love with you,

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:33.314
and there is no place else
that I would rather be.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.551
Well, we're probably
going to have to make up

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:38.485
a few more rules

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.220
if we're going to be
under the same roof?

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:41.355
Okay.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.791
Let's start with
rule number one.

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:45.025
Hello!

01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:46.660
Excuse me?

01:22:46.696 --> 01:22:49.396
Laura, you forgot your camera
in the gallery, dear.

01:22:49.432 --> 01:22:51.065
You really need to be
a little more careful.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:51.966
Thank you.

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.834
Spencer...

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:55.970
I wondered when you'd be back.

01:22:56.005 --> 01:22:56.937
How did you...?

01:22:56.973 --> 01:23:00.341
The light is absolutely
perfect right now.

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.176
Come on, outside.
Let's go.

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:05.646
This is going to be
a great picture.

01:23:09.509 --> 01:23:13.009
