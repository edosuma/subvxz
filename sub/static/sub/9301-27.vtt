WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:25.991 --> 01:32.260
At last, I, Tauron the magician,
am ready for the final stage.

01:36.368 --> 01:39.201
Dragon fire, grave dust...

01:42.107 --> 01:45.099
and essence of midnight will continue,

01:52.518 --> 01:55.578
and bring me the allies I need...

01:56.888 --> 01:59.356
to rule Eternia...

01:59.425 --> 02:00.915
forever.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.804
Looks like a storm's brewing.
We can take shelter...

02:11.804 --> 02:13.499
in that cave.

02:20.379 --> 02:23.007
Lightnings flash!

02:30.956 --> 02:33.823
Uh oh, that sounds like trouble.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.337
I may not like getting wet,

02:40.362 --> 02:42.983
but I'm afraid of the dark.

02:43.435 --> 02:44.703
Don't worry Cringer...

02:44.703 --> 02:46.255
As long as I've got my magic wand,

02:46.280 --> 02:48.219
you've got nothing to fear.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.411
Adam?

02:55.114 --> 02:57.344
Oh c'mon, Cringer?
What is it now?

02:57.583 --> 02:59.141
Did you see a mouse?

03:05.090 --> 03:07.326
That's no mouse, Orko...

03:07.326 --> 03:09.021
That's a Manticore.

03:14.927 --> 03:15.927
Adam.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.164
Quick. T-The power sword.

03:20.606 --> 03:22.198
By the power of...

03:24.376 --> 03:25.900
Well, team,

03:26.111 --> 03:28.579
any other ideas?

03:28.781 --> 03:31.648
I dunno, I'm all out of magic.

03:31.884 --> 03:35.285
That's the first good
news I've heard all day.

03:36.188 --> 03:39.021
Look out, here he comes.

03:44.563 --> 03:46.791
I now command my new

03:46.816 --> 03:50.468
allies from another world to...

03:50.481 --> 03:52.281
come forth!

03:54.773 --> 03:59.676
Gark, my sixth sense is warning
me of danger coming from Eternia.

04:10.022 --> 04:14.049
Creature, it is I, Tauron,
who have summoned you.

04:14.293 --> 04:18.753
By my spell, I bind you to my will.

04:22.801 --> 04:24.393
What is your name?

04:24.778 --> 04:25.778
Gark!

04:26.204 --> 04:29.300
Then, Gark, I shall call you.

04:29.307 --> 04:32.878
There were two forks of
lightning, and so you must have...

04:32.878 --> 04:35.904
a partner with powers equal to your own.

04:42.521 --> 04:45.123
I wish I had some magic that could help.

04:45.123 --> 04:46.886
Adam, Cringer, look out!

04:48.093 --> 04:49.958
What's going on?

04:50.963 --> 04:52.931
Be careful, Adam.

04:56.368 --> 04:57.596
Uncle Montork!

04:57.936 --> 04:59.836
Uncle Montork? Uncle Montork?

05:02.474 --> 05:04.271
Aha... Orko, my lad!

05:06.345 --> 05:09.337
Quick, Cringer, this could be our chance.

05:11.984 --> 05:14.214
Uncle, we gotta get outta here.

05:14.453 --> 05:17.945
Free from this puny beast?
I'll bet it's only a baby.

05:22.227 --> 05:24.320
Me and my big mouth.

05:26.665 --> 05:29.259
By the power of Grayskull!

05:35.874 --> 05:39.935
I have the power!

05:53.191 --> 05:56.183
Come on, partner. Let's go.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.158
Uncle Montork, do something.

06:03.335 --> 06:05.360
My powers don't seem to be working.

06:17.983 --> 06:19.384
Hey, big fella...

06:19.384 --> 06:22.820
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

06:27.292 --> 06:30.420
You should have these things trimmed.

06:30.596 --> 06:33.861
Now let's see if we can, turn thing around.

06:37.269 --> 06:38.646
I think we'd better move,

06:38.671 --> 06:41.093
before that monster gets back on his feet.

06:49.648 --> 06:51.479
Where did he come from?

06:51.783 --> 06:55.378
Would you believe it if I
told you it was my magic?

06:56.154 --> 06:58.247
-Nope.
Then I won't tell you that.

07:07.099 --> 07:08.498
Stand clear!

07:13.472 --> 07:14.473
Well...

07:14.473 --> 07:15.868
we'll be gone by the time that

07:15.893 --> 07:17.660
monster gets his way out from there.

07:17.809 --> 07:20.112
I was hoping you two would've made it out.

07:20.112 --> 07:22.881
Yeah,
lucky He-Man showed up...

07:22.881 --> 07:25.816
or that monster would
have had us for lunch.

07:26.385 --> 07:28.420
Hey, maybe lunch will bring you

07:28.445 --> 07:30.675
back your powers, Uncle Montork.

07:30.822 --> 07:33.052
He's the best magician in our family.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.919
Orko, there are things
more important than magic.

07:36.028 --> 07:37.663
Really, like what?

07:37.663 --> 07:40.791
Like getting to see you
again, ya little rascal!

07:41.366 --> 07:43.027
Haha, now let's do some talking.

07:49.174 --> 07:52.200
A strange story, Montork.

07:52.411 --> 07:56.814
To be sure, my pet Gark and I
got hit by a mysterious ray...

07:57.282 --> 07:58.544
and here I am.

08:01.787 --> 08:04.348
There you are indeed, Montork.

08:05.257 --> 08:08.420
Our final partner in power.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.856
Gark will bind you to my will...

08:13.098 --> 08:17.535
and our combined magic shall
make me the Master of Eternia...

08:18.270 --> 08:19.931
forever.

08:26.878 --> 08:28.607
Gark, am I happy to see you.

08:31.783 --> 08:34.547
That's your uncle's pet?

08:37.522 --> 08:38.716
Uncle Montork?

08:38.924 --> 08:40.221
Stay back, Orko!

08:41.893 --> 08:43.554
I told you to stay back.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.891
Hey, wait a minute, hold on.

08:52.471 --> 08:53.961
What... what's going on?

08:54.740 --> 08:58.473
Gee, Orko.
I-I don't know what came over me.

09:00.579 --> 09:03.882
Oh yes I do, I have regained my...

09:03.882 --> 09:07.147
powers to serve Tauron, my supreme master.

09:07.719 --> 09:09.846
Adam, what's he talking about?

09:10.288 --> 09:13.692
Tauron is an evil wizard,
and he seems to have put your uncle...

09:13.692 --> 09:15.660
and Gark under a spell.

09:15.827 --> 09:17.192
Take care of them!

09:18.531 --> 09:21.261
Please, you gotta snap out of that spell.

09:23.869 --> 09:26.895
Why should that little
one look so familiar?

09:29.307 --> 09:32.208
It's the trick of my master's enemies.

09:36.448 --> 09:39.279
I think this is where I make my exit.

09:52.731 --> 09:55.325
Ha! That one will be easy game.

09:55.801 --> 09:58.065
Easier said than done.

09:58.236 --> 10:00.727
By the power of Grayskull!

10:06.912 --> 10:10.643
I have the power!

10:27.065 --> 10:30.068
Sorry, Montork, Adam and Cringer...

10:30.068 --> 10:32.730
had a pressing engagement.

10:32.971 --> 10:36.737
I hope we'll do instead.

10:37.175 --> 10:39.166
Indeed you will.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.605
After them, Gark.

10:49.688 --> 10:53.215
Uh, wha... what's going on?
What am I doing here?

10:53.391 --> 10:56.758
I will tell you what's going on, Montork.

10:57.362 --> 10:58.386
Look!

10:58.663 --> 11:02.429
The time for games is over, He-Man.

11:02.667 --> 11:07.604
Now the true test... begins.

11:10.976 --> 11:12.967
Tauron the magician.

11:13.311 --> 11:16.405
So, you're behind all this.

11:16.581 --> 11:19.675
My patience for games, is over.

11:19.885 --> 11:23.150
The time has come to
seize our main objective.

11:23.688 --> 11:26.522
Castle Grayskull itself.

11:27.058 --> 11:29.185
Master, we obey.

11:36.301 --> 11:37.928
Uncle Montork, come back.

11:43.141 --> 11:46.269
Our objective: Castle Grayskull.

11:48.713 --> 11:51.773
And now to launch our attack.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.924
He-Man, I can't believe
he would do something like this.

11:58.924 --> 12:01.791
He's my uncle.
He's also under a spell, Orko.

12:01.993 --> 12:04.427
Controlled by Tauron's Amulet.

12:10.702 --> 12:12.711
Battle Cat, you know the way to Tauron's

12:12.736 --> 12:14.995
Cave. Take Orko,

12:15.507 --> 12:18.408
and get that amulet.

12:18.443 --> 12:21.246
We'll save him, Orko.
I'll meet you at Grayskull.

12:21.246 --> 12:22.679
Good luck!

12:23.748 --> 12:27.684
With Orko's kind of magic,
we're sure gonna need it.

12:45.003 --> 12:46.664
What beautiful visitors.

12:46.905 --> 12:49.931
Wait, those aren't butterflies, they're...

12:50.976 --> 12:54.707
Servants of Tauron,
the new master of Grayskull!

12:55.280 --> 12:55.905
He-Man!

12:56.681 --> 12:59.775
He-Man,
there are enemies in Grayskull.

13:00.285 --> 13:02.150
I'm on my way.

13:04.255 --> 13:08.021
Enough of this riding.
I'm going to levitate.

13:10.962 --> 13:14.898
So... you dare challenge my power?

13:20.105 --> 13:21.868
Battle Cat, you distract Tauron...

13:24.142 --> 13:27.771
while I destroy his collection
of black magic gizmo's.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.510
What is it, Gark?

13:38.056 --> 13:39.523
You've found it?

13:41.026 --> 13:44.189
Yes, the power is stronger here.

13:44.829 --> 13:48.663
No, they must not reach the
door to the inner chambers.

13:50.168 --> 13:53.103
The door to the inner chambers of power.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.101
I must pass through.

13:57.042 --> 14:00.842
No, you shall proceed no further.

14:03.248 --> 14:06.252
Nothing you can do will
keep us from our goal.

14:08.252 --> 14:10.652
It won't be long now.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.018
He-Man...

14:13.358 --> 14:14.450
Hurry!

14:14.759 --> 14:17.629
These two are more
powerful than we thought.

14:17.629 --> 14:20.894
I'm almost there, Sorceress.
Open the Jawbridge.

14:21.332 --> 14:24.699
Jawbridge, I command thee open.

14:32.777 --> 14:35.803
Uh oh, time for the automatic pilot and...

14:42.253 --> 14:43.777
Sorceress, I'm coming.

14:47.826 --> 14:49.880
Well, here's an armload of power that

14:49.905 --> 14:52.150
Tauron will never use again.

14:52.363 --> 14:54.593
You troublesome trollan.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.992
You'll pay dearly for this.

15:06.010 --> 15:07.773
Good work, Battle Cat.

15:08.012 --> 15:11.948
I command you, amulet of power.
Take us to Grayskull!

15:14.052 --> 15:17.044
Ha! I can now enter the inner chambers.

15:17.222 --> 15:19.656
Not if I can stop you.

15:22.660 --> 15:27.359
Ha! You think your sword is
good, just wait'll you see mine.

15:28.759 --> 15:29.759
Whoops...

15:30.535 --> 15:33.504
[laughs] How original! Flower power.

15:33.738 --> 15:35.641
The sword must be in my other cape.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.736
Gark, I need reinforcements.

15:43.848 --> 15:45.611
Down, boy, down.

15:47.018 --> 15:48.576
What's going on?

15:48.786 --> 15:50.651
Gark, He-Man's the enemy.

15:50.822 --> 15:53.484
It looks like the spell is wearing off.

15:53.691 --> 15:58.094
Spell? You mean... Ah, you can't fool me.

15:58.329 --> 16:00.298
You are the master's enemy and I shall find

16:00.323 --> 16:02.414
a weapon to beat you yet.

16:03.368 --> 16:05.233
Montork!  Wait!

16:10.175 --> 16:12.092
Ha! What a pleasure, to use one of

16:12.117 --> 16:13.760
He-Man's weapons against him!

16:13.978 --> 16:16.237
Stay away from the Talon Fighter, Montork.

16:16.262 --> 16:17.995
You won't be able to control it.

16:18.249 --> 16:20.046
Oh no? Just watch me.

16:27.926 --> 16:31.418
It looks like Orko's
goof-ups run in the family.

16:43.241 --> 16:45.869
It's time you left the flying to me.

16:46.110 --> 16:48.408
Now if we could just
free you from that spell.

16:48.646 --> 16:49.670
Look!

16:53.017 --> 16:55.008
He-Man, we've got the amulet.

16:55.853 --> 16:59.050
Oh no, I did it again.
We brought Tauron too.

17:01.292 --> 17:02.884
We'd better get down there.

17:03.094 --> 17:04.617
-Help!
...and fast.

17:04.862 --> 17:06.261
Help me!

17:17.308 --> 17:21.005
He-Man, you must destroy
the amulet immediately.

17:21.412 --> 17:23.003
He-Man, catch.

17:24.015 --> 17:27.746
No!  Montork, do something.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.287
I obey, master.

17:32.991 --> 17:34.583
I obey.

17:36.127 --> 17:40.655
Excellent, Montork.
Now... give it to me.

17:40.665 --> 17:43.634
With our magical power we'll be invincible.

17:43.901 --> 17:45.596
Orko, it's up to you.

17:45.903 --> 17:48.201
You've got to stop your uncle.

17:49.907 --> 17:52.777
Uncle Montork, you told me yourself...

17:52.777 --> 17:55.405
some things are more
important than magical power.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.942
Don't give Tauron that stone.

17:58.116 --> 18:00.218
What was that you called me?

18:00.218 --> 18:02.948
You are my Uncle Montork. I'm Orko.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.746
You're under a spell, but I want you back.

18:06.024 --> 18:07.889
Orko?

18:08.159 --> 18:12.261
Please come back. Try... think. I'm Orko.

18:12.297 --> 18:14.829
You're the one who taught me every trick

18:14.832 --> 18:17.168
I know.
Of course they don't always

18:17.193 --> 18:18.815
work, but please, uncle,

18:19.037 --> 18:22.097
please... I love you.  Come back

18:24.575 --> 18:27.457
Orko, my lad. You did it, Orko.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.831
You helped me break the spell.

18:29.480 --> 18:33.143
Montork. Give me the amulet.

18:33.451 --> 18:35.476
No way, Tauron.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.248
He-Man,
see what your sword can do with this.

18:38.623 --> 18:40.318
With pleasure.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.258
No, no.

18:47.465 --> 18:49.763
My power is...

18:49.967 --> 18:53.964
destroyed, I am ruined...

18:56.240 --> 18:58.731
and I'm back to normal at last.

19:02.146 --> 19:04.546
Oh, Gark, I'm so happy to see you.

19:06.484 --> 19:09.920
Now that's what I call a friendly monster.

19:11.055 --> 19:12.590
With the spell broken...

19:12.590 --> 19:15.525
I'm feeling the pull of
our own dimension again .

19:15.727 --> 19:17.695
Uncle Montork, please, stay.

19:17.929 --> 19:19.630
You've got to teach me more magic so I...

19:19.630 --> 19:21.198
can be a great wizard like you.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.469
You just proved you don't need
magic to be great, Orko...

19:25.269 --> 19:29.638
After all, it wasn't your magic that
broke the spell, it was your love.

19:30.441 --> 19:31.874
Gark?  He's gone.

19:32.944 --> 19:35.208
Uncle Montork, don't go.

19:35.513 --> 19:36.946
We've got no choice.

19:37.382 --> 19:38.713
Goodbye, Uncle Montork.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.846
Give my regards to the rest of the family.

19:42.387 --> 19:45.256
Keep up the good
work, but remember...

19:45.256 --> 19:48.521
There's magic all around us,
if we just stop to see it.

19:48.793 --> 19:51.591
The most wonderful magic of all is just

19:51.863 --> 19:54.297
being alive.
Make the most of it, Orko.

19:55.081 --> 19:56.648
Make the most of it.

19:58.669 --> 20:02.097
Oh, well,
I'm glad everyone didn't disappear.

20:02.140 --> 20:05.906
[laughs] Don't worry, Orko.
We're not leaving.

20:06.110 --> 20:08.544
Someone's got to stay
and keep an eye on you...

20:08.813 --> 20:10.872
and we've got the job.

20:14.552 --> 20:16.854
If there's one thing better than being a...

20:16.854 --> 20:18.693
great magician. It's being alive

20:18.718 --> 20:20.211
and having great friends

20:20.358 --> 20:22.785
like you.
And I'm gonna make the most of it.

20:30.735 --> 20:33.671
My uncle Montork taught
me a lot about magic.

20:33.671 --> 20:35.273
But not just the regular kind.

20:35.273 --> 20:37.909
He taught me how to see the
magic that's all around us.

20:37.909 --> 20:40.433
Like for instance,
there just has to be magic

20:40.458 --> 20:42.597
in anything as beautiful as a rainbow.

20:42.880 --> 20:47.214
And there's real magic in the way
a mother takes care of her young.

20:47.252 --> 20:49.487
But, as my uncle said,

20:49.487 --> 20:53.287
The most wonderful magic
of all is just being alive.

20:54.192 --> 20:55.819
Bye now!
