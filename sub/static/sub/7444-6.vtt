00:16.621 --> 00:18.054
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.541 --> 00:38.179
It's a jungle out there.

00:52.981 --> 00:57.941
# I've got someone on the left
of my left side

00:57.976 --> 01:02.381
# I've got cigarette
on cigarette mindful

01:02.416 --> 01:04.346
# I got foolish... #

01:04.381 --> 01:06.186
Throughout
the gangland war to date,

01:06.221 --> 01:09.541
the most dangerous man in town
had so far gone unnoticed.

01:09.576 --> 01:12.698
In a year he'd be a household name.

01:12.733 --> 01:15.297
This is Andrew 'Benji' Veniamin.

01:15.332 --> 01:17.861
#... don't tell me you want me

01:17.896 --> 01:22.466
# I... I'm over it

01:22.501 --> 01:27.141
# You can't have it
and that's why you want it

01:27.176 --> 01:32.746
# I... I'm over it

01:32.781 --> 01:35.701
# Baby, if you and me
aren't trying

01:35.736 --> 01:37.581
# I can't see the point

01:37.616 --> 01:40.095
# Come on, come on

01:42.181 --> 01:45.821
# Baby, if you and me
aren't trying

01:45.856 --> 01:47.716
# I can't see the point

01:47.751 --> 01:49.576
# Come on, come on... #

01:51.621 --> 01:53.066
Hey, heading out?

01:53.101 --> 01:54.546
Yeah, Mick wants to catch up.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.581
You sure you're gonna be
warm enough like that, darling?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.014
I'm fine, Mama.
Hmm.

01:59.381 --> 02:00.946
Relax, OK?

02:00.981 --> 02:02.699
OK. Catch youse later.

02:11.501 --> 02:15.221
The matter of Mark Moran
was still fresh in everyone's mind.

02:15.256 --> 02:17.546
And although no-one knew
who'd done it,

02:17.581 --> 02:20.778
his dad, Lewis Moran,
already had a prime suspect.

02:22.741 --> 02:24.174
Benj.
Mate.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.378
You know whose name
keeps cropping up? Dino.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.721
No, mate, he's a good bloke.
I know he's a mate of yours...

02:37.756 --> 02:40.048
Unless Mark was dogging on him...
He's a fucking loose cannon!

02:40.083 --> 02:42.341
Listen, you're looking for...
Are you... are you LISTENING TO ME?!

02:42.376 --> 02:44.146
Hey. Come on, calm down.

02:44.181 --> 02:47.701
You two went to school
together, yeah?

02:49.861 --> 02:53.261
Yeah. Did more than that.
We got expelled together.

02:53.296 --> 02:55.172
Yeah, well, I can't write him off yet.

02:57.181 --> 02:58.614
Wasn't him.

03:02.261 --> 03:04.421
Lew Caine is getting out
of the nick this morning.

03:04.456 --> 03:06.013
Do you wanna pick him up for us?

03:08.101 --> 03:09.534
Yeah, righto.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.026
Give us your keys, buddy.
Hmm?

03:12.061 --> 03:14.701
Mick wants me to do a job for him.
Give us your keys.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.666
Yeah, yeah.

03:15.701 --> 03:17.692
When'll I get it back?
Couple of hours.

03:37.461 --> 03:39.077
Hey, Lew.

03:39.112 --> 03:40.694
Benji.

03:43.861 --> 03:45.852
Listen. The boys have heard
good things about you.

03:48.381 --> 03:51.021
Thought you might like a place
to crash for a week or two.

03:51.056 --> 03:54.021
Give you a new phone and some cash.
Get you going.

03:54.056 --> 03:57.381
Can I trust 'em?
Oh, they tell it straight.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.986
They look after their own.

03:59.021 --> 04:02.013
Which is more than I can say
about any other prick in this town.

04:05.981 --> 04:07.701
Look at her tits.

04:07.736 --> 04:09.618
Yeah, I saw, mate.

04:09.653 --> 04:11.466
There he is.
Benji.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.921
Hey.
How you doing, Nik?

04:13.956 --> 04:16.305
We just talking about you.

04:16.341 --> 04:19.421
PK told me, what, you don't
work for him no more, huh?

04:19.456 --> 04:21.065
Relax, mate, will ya?

04:21.101 --> 04:24.621
Yeah? This Mick, this big bloke,
he keep you busy?

04:24.656 --> 04:26.746
He's taking it easy.

04:26.781 --> 04:28.481
Especially since Mark got popped.

04:28.516 --> 04:30.181
Yeah, that is surprise for me.

04:30.216 --> 04:32.226
Hmm. You heard anything?

04:32.261 --> 04:34.866
No. The dealers,
they don't say much.

04:34.901 --> 04:37.761
They're not crying, of course.
He was arsehole to all of them.

04:37.796 --> 04:40.621
Couldn't have been Rocco, could it?
No. He was at the airport.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.138
He was there with Dino?

04:42.173 --> 04:44.037
No, no, no. Just him.

04:44.072 --> 04:45.866
Just Rocco.
Mmm.

04:45.901 --> 04:48.096
Nobody knows
where the hell Dino was.

04:51.661 --> 04:53.341
All of South Melbourne
should be yours, Carl.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.021
There should be business
fucking everywhere.

04:55.056 --> 04:55.986
Yeah, yeah.

04:56.021 --> 04:57.826
Oh, don't just say 'yeah'.
Look at what happened.

04:57.861 --> 05:01.061
Mark gets offed and all the pushers
go straight to the old man.

05:01.096 --> 05:03.291
Come on.

05:11.421 --> 05:13.701
I guess we should do something
about him too, I guess.

05:13.736 --> 05:15.946
Hey, hey. Don't get
carried away, mate.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.821
Mark and Jason are one thing.
But the dad's got mates, you know?

05:18.856 --> 05:20.266
Lots of them.

05:20.301 --> 05:22.266
We've gotta keep
building the business, Dino.

05:22.301 --> 05:26.381
If old man Moran's in the way,
we've gotta get him out of the way.

05:26.416 --> 05:28.318
Do you hear yourself talk?

05:28.353 --> 05:30.247
Mate, it's not that hard.

05:30.282 --> 05:31.968
I've done it, remember?

05:32.003 --> 05:33.654
Found it easy, did you?

05:35.581 --> 05:37.821
Just gotta do what's in
our best interest, Dino.

05:37.856 --> 05:39.946
Lewis Moran. Shit!

05:39.981 --> 05:41.466
He's gonna get us all killed, mate.

05:41.501 --> 05:44.461
Hey, what if the Morans actually
heard it was Carl who shot Mark?

05:44.496 --> 05:46.038
He wouldn't live out the week.

05:46.073 --> 05:47.546
One answer, then.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.026
He's making the gear, though, Dino.

05:49.061 --> 05:51.461
We don't want Carl whacked. That's
where all the money's coming from.

05:51.496 --> 05:53.741
Come on, matey.
He's got a good system going, yeah?

05:53.776 --> 05:56.141
We're all making a buck.
Everyone's happy.

05:56.176 --> 05:58.506
So we don't wanna dog on him, OK?

05:58.541 --> 06:01.851
We've just gotta convince him
to pull his head in. Alright?

06:05.981 --> 06:09.901
Boss, just go with me
on this for a second, OK?

06:09.936 --> 06:12.226
Carl shoots Mark.

06:12.261 --> 06:15.697
Then he races to the pub where he
knew he'd be seen on security camera.

06:16.741 --> 06:19.461
You have to admit,
it's the most credible scenario.

06:19.496 --> 06:20.586
Is it?

06:20.621 --> 06:24.261
Mark was also taking business
off Nik Radev and PK

06:24.296 --> 06:26.866
and dobbing Tony Mokbel
into the drug squad.

06:26.901 --> 06:29.981
Why are they less credible
than some two-bit drug cook?

06:30.016 --> 06:31.619
Keep an open mind, Steve.

06:33.981 --> 06:35.414
What do you reckon?

06:37.821 --> 06:39.266
To be honest,

06:39.301 --> 06:41.690
I don't reckon he looks like
he'd be able to kill anyone.

06:47.461 --> 06:49.895
The bottle shop's just there.
Steve, it's there!

06:55.541 --> 06:57.941
19:39. It wasn't Carl.

06:57.976 --> 07:00.306
It had to be Carl.

07:00.341 --> 07:03.701
Steve, Carl's on camera here within
15 minutes of Mark Moran being shot.

07:03.736 --> 07:06.421
We can't get here under 19
and we're in a V8 cop car.

07:06.456 --> 07:07.649
It wasn't Carl.

07:14.661 --> 07:15.906
Oi.

07:15.941 --> 07:18.221
Shouldn't you be going easy
when you're pregnant?

07:18.256 --> 07:19.906
Fuck off!

07:19.941 --> 07:22.546
Don't tell me to fuck off.
You've got a baby in there.

07:22.581 --> 07:24.941
You should be thinking about
what you're putting in your fat guts.

07:24.976 --> 07:26.577
Yeah, but that's all...

07:26.612 --> 07:28.179
Jesus!

07:32.021 --> 07:33.500
Jesus! Stay down!

07:42.741 --> 07:44.600
It's alright!

07:44.635 --> 07:46.459
Carl!
Shut up!

07:49.221 --> 07:52.531
Alright. It's alright.
It's alright. It's alright.

07:55.061 --> 07:57.701
What the hell was that? Thought
you said were gonna talk to him!

07:57.736 --> 08:00.101
You said we have to
get him to pull his head in.

08:00.136 --> 08:01.626
You reckon that'll do it?!
Jesus Christ!

08:01.661 --> 08:03.701
How do you normally calm people down?
Shooting their house...

08:03.736 --> 08:05.981
We can't talk to him!
He only listens to wifey!

08:06.016 --> 08:07.626
Getting him not to go after Lewis

08:07.661 --> 08:09.341
by making him think
they're gunning for him -

08:09.376 --> 08:10.774
how the fuck does that work?!

08:15.981 --> 08:17.146
Man!

08:17.181 --> 08:20.093
Rocco, we can do anything, mate!
We are the kings of fucking Sunshine!

08:25.141 --> 08:26.861
What the?!
What are you doing, you idiot?!

08:26.896 --> 08:28.506
You ran a stop sign!

08:28.541 --> 08:29.986
You spastic!
Are you fucking blind, mate?!

08:30.021 --> 08:32.741
Did you see what you did?
What are you gonna do about it?

08:32.775 --> 08:34.660
Take his head and stick it
through his windscreen!

08:34.696 --> 08:36.413
Come on, bro! You spastic!

08:38.461 --> 08:40.546
Rocco, get in the car!

08:40.581 --> 08:42.572
Rocco, get in the car! Come on!

08:43.861 --> 08:46.933
You're crazy, mate!
Absolutely fucking crazy!

09:01.341 --> 09:04.141
What are you doing in here, Carl?!
Get out there and deal with it!

09:04.176 --> 09:05.781
My daughter's terrified!
I'm terrified!

09:05.816 --> 09:07.226
The house is a fucking bomb site!

09:07.261 --> 09:11.661
We're out there and
you're fucking hiding in the dunny!

09:11.696 --> 09:13.106
Fucking bullshit, Carl!

09:13.141 --> 09:16.461
Get off your fucking arse,
you big fucking scaredy-cat!

09:16.496 --> 09:19.781
Get off your fat arse
and deal with the mess!

09:19.816 --> 09:21.260
ROBERTA!

09:28.301 --> 09:30.581
Just shut up, alright?!

09:30.616 --> 09:32.155
Just shut up, OK?

09:32.190 --> 09:33.694
Let me think.

09:40.141 --> 09:42.121
Well, luckily the driver survived

09:42.156 --> 09:44.066
and he made a statement against Rocco

09:44.101 --> 09:46.381
and, for once,
the magistrate didn't grant bail.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.576
So, Rocco's gone.
I mean, he's locked up.

09:49.821 --> 09:52.341
Yep. Out of our hair
for about four to five years.

09:52.376 --> 09:53.786
But Dino is still free.

09:53.821 --> 09:55.786
Well, he's not exactly free.

09:55.821 --> 09:59.221
He's out on bail for abduction.
Hasn't been tried yet.

09:59.256 --> 10:00.893
Can I have the keys?

10:02.141 --> 10:03.586
Here.
Thanks.

10:03.621 --> 10:07.181
Ever noticed how
the Panadol at Safeways

10:07.216 --> 10:08.626
is always right next to the condoms?

10:08.661 --> 10:10.866
Well, let's call for
a royal commission.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.701
No, all I'm saying is it's not
exactly encouraging, is it?

10:13.736 --> 10:15.941
Can't you just, I don't know,
get rid of him somehow?

10:15.976 --> 10:17.741
What, the bloke
that stacks the shelves?

10:17.776 --> 10:19.746
No, stupid. Dino.

10:19.781 --> 10:22.301
I mean, he goes into petrol stations
and shoots them up.

10:22.336 --> 10:23.746
And kidnaps people.

10:23.781 --> 10:26.661
I don't want him walking around
in the same city that I live in.

10:26.696 --> 10:28.946
Are you serious?

10:28.981 --> 10:31.621
If I just went and shot him,
what would you think of me?

10:31.656 --> 10:33.626
Half of me would be like, "Thank God."

10:33.661 --> 10:37.701
You can't just want the result and
shut your eyes to the consequences.

10:37.736 --> 10:40.381
If I got my service revolver,
went over to Sunshine

10:40.416 --> 10:41.826
and just killed the bloke,

10:41.861 --> 10:44.091
I'd be no better than him, would I?

10:50.061 --> 10:52.226
See the door, Dino?

10:52.261 --> 10:54.491
Lewis Moran and his mates?

10:56.421 --> 10:58.066
Yep.
They did that?

10:58.101 --> 11:01.301
Probably. You know, like I heard,
as a warning to back off.

11:01.336 --> 11:02.746
You're kidding me.

11:02.781 --> 11:04.921
It's letting me know
I'm on a hit list.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.061
Nah, nah, it's nothing
like that, mate.

11:07.096 --> 11:08.786
Mate, I know this family.

11:08.821 --> 11:11.861
They wanna see me running around
shitting myself for a few days,

11:11.896 --> 11:13.466
then they'll whack me.

11:13.501 --> 11:16.021
It's no fun killing me
unless I'm shit-scared first.

11:16.056 --> 11:17.466
Nup. I don't think so.

11:17.501 --> 11:21.061
You know what I think? I think
they don't know it was you, yeah?

11:21.096 --> 11:22.826
They're not sure it was you,

11:22.861 --> 11:25.821
so they're just, like, telling you
to pull your fucking head in, mate,

11:25.856 --> 11:27.698
just in case it was you.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.778
Dino, have you been shot by a Moran?

11:32.941 --> 11:34.786
No. Well, I have.
So shut up and listen.

11:34.821 --> 11:39.221
They will shoot me unless
we do something about them first.

11:39.256 --> 11:41.346
You're not scared of them, but.

11:41.381 --> 11:44.771
He's fucking terrified.
Oh, fuck, chips.

11:48.021 --> 11:50.701
But anyway, we've made
a shitload of gear

11:50.736 --> 11:52.146
and those stupid squarehead clubbers

11:52.181 --> 11:54.341
are buying 100,000 little buggers
every weekend.

11:54.376 --> 11:56.346
So cash flow's good.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.746
We're sitting on
a golden goose, mate.

11:58.781 --> 12:01.454
We've just gotta make sure
we can live to enjoy it.

12:03.461 --> 12:06.941
So you find me someone
to whack Lewis, or do it yourself.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.386
I don't care.

12:08.421 --> 12:10.221
Got two words for you, Carl.

12:10.256 --> 12:12.052
Mick Gatto.

12:15.061 --> 12:16.626
Just come back to me with a price.

12:16.661 --> 12:20.540
Lewis Moran. Fuck. No-one's gonna
touch it for under a 100 g's.

12:22.581 --> 12:24.378
Alright, 100 g's, then.

12:27.741 --> 12:30.335
Serious?
I'll even put 50 up front.

12:33.981 --> 12:35.506
Chips inside.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.861
Oh, thanks, darl.
Do you wanna bring 'em out for us?

12:37.896 --> 12:40.181
You want chips, you fucking
get off your fucking arses,

12:40.216 --> 12:42.021
you cocksucking pair of poofters.

12:55.581 --> 12:57.186
17:24.

12:57.221 --> 12:59.257
Give us the Melways, will you?
We'll find another route.

13:00.501 --> 13:02.621
Tell you what,
you choose the route...

13:02.656 --> 13:04.418
<i>... and I'll drive.</i>

13:07.501 --> 13:08.946
It's a point of honour, Benj.

13:08.981 --> 13:11.381
If Dino killed Mark,
I have to put him in the ground.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.372
But that's the thing, Lewis.
It's an 'if'.

13:14.581 --> 13:16.412
We just don't know where Dino was.
That's all.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.696
I'm prepared to put money
on the table for this, Benj.

13:23.461 --> 13:26.146
How much?
Fif... Forty.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.141
Fifty grand.
Forty grand. Top rates.

13:28.176 --> 13:30.266
Oh, it's a fair price.

13:30.301 --> 13:34.374
Look, I know he was a mate of yours,
but if you can find someone...

13:37.421 --> 13:40.413
Are you with me, Benj? Or him?

13:47.261 --> 13:50.621
Lewis, I just... I wanna know
he done it, that's all.

13:50.656 --> 13:51.586
OK.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.221
OK.
OK.

13:53.256 --> 13:54.818
Let me know.

13:54.853 --> 13:56.346
Good boy.

13:56.381 --> 13:58.306
Uh... Benji.
What?

13:58.341 --> 14:00.706
Um, you've still got my wheels.
Yeah, I know.

14:00.741 --> 14:03.181
I've got a few things to do.
It's just that I need...

14:03.216 --> 14:04.614
Giovanni.

14:06.421 --> 14:07.376
Relax.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.826
Mario.

14:10.861 --> 14:12.533
Talk to Mick.

14:13.581 --> 14:15.341
He's not my boy.

14:25.661 --> 14:28.721
15:15. He did it.

14:28.756 --> 14:31.781
Carl bloody did it.

14:33.301 --> 14:35.741
# Welcome to the sound of my head

14:35.776 --> 14:38.226
# My weary head

14:38.261 --> 14:43.541
# I can't, can't, can't step back
and look away

14:43.576 --> 14:46.931
# Your sad face makes me wanna

14:47.981 --> 14:50.017
# Drop another pill... #

14:54.581 --> 14:56.266
Hey, back to work?

14:56.301 --> 14:58.221
Yeah.
Yeah, what time this arvo?

14:58.256 --> 14:59.781
Depends on what's going on.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.226
Hey.
Oh, thanks.

15:02.261 --> 15:04.101
Yeah, but I'm catching up
with Dino first.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.941
I thought you were out
of the drug world.

15:05.976 --> 15:07.906
I am, Ba.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.386
We're still mates.
What? PK and Dino?

15:10.421 --> 15:12.781
Yeah, you know.
It's not like the old days.

15:12.816 --> 15:14.626
Oh, good. Good to see.

15:14.661 --> 15:16.811
I knew you'd settle down sometime.

15:17.941 --> 15:20.346
Hey, nice car outside.
Yeah, it looks good, doesn't it?

15:20.381 --> 15:23.581
Mmm. Take care of it. If they trust
you with it, you look after it.

15:23.616 --> 15:25.026
Dad, I do, alright?

15:25.061 --> 15:27.146
Are you home for tea?
No, actually.

15:27.181 --> 15:29.581
I'm gonna be late again.
Leave something in the fridge for me?

15:29.616 --> 15:32.061
Yeah. Just so long
as you promise me it'll get eaten, OK?

15:32.096 --> 15:33.901
OK, Mama. I promise.

15:37.781 --> 15:38.746
Yep.

15:38.781 --> 15:40.499
Yeah, buddy, I'll be there soon.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.138
Hey, have you ever met Carl?

15:46.421 --> 15:47.386
Nup.

15:47.421 --> 15:49.596
You doing work for him, are you?

15:49.631 --> 15:51.771
Oh, you know. Here and there.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.461
Morans shot up his front door.
Did they?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.506
Yeah, well, someone did.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.101
And there ain't no-one else
that's got it in for him.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.021
Morans aren't after Carl.

16:03.056 --> 16:04.666
Bullshit.

16:04.701 --> 16:06.186
They hate his guts.

16:06.221 --> 16:08.141
They shot him in the fucking guts.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.586
That was Jason.

16:09.621 --> 16:11.521
Jason's off his dial, mate.

16:11.556 --> 16:13.386
I'm telling you, Benji.

16:13.421 --> 16:15.821
If we don't get Lewis Moran,
he's gonna get Carl.

16:15.856 --> 16:17.266
That's bullshit.

16:17.301 --> 16:19.561
Listen, I've been speaking to Lewis
and he ain't said nothing.

16:19.596 --> 16:21.821
Well, he ain't said nothing
'cause he knows we're mates, yeah?

16:21.856 --> 16:23.254
You ought to see Carl's front door.

16:24.781 --> 16:27.061
Benji, the bloke's a fucking
low-life, double-crossing dog.

16:27.096 --> 16:28.026
Yeah, yeah.

16:28.061 --> 16:30.814
All Carl's doing is trying to make money.
That's all he wants to do.

16:32.461 --> 16:35.141
OK, so I'm not saying yes,
'cause I'm not accepting nothing yet,

16:35.176 --> 16:36.699
but what's he putting up?

16:38.821 --> 16:40.220
100.

16:44.381 --> 16:45.450
Fucking hell.

16:46.941 --> 16:48.441
Oh, fuck.

16:48.476 --> 16:49.906
I know, mate.

16:49.941 --> 16:52.121
This has gotta stay between us, OK?
We go way back.

16:52.156 --> 16:54.301
I mean, you're rolling
with these Carlton guys now.

16:54.336 --> 16:55.946
You know where they go.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.414
I know we could do it together.

16:58.461 --> 17:00.099
If you want a pay day.

17:03.421 --> 17:04.979
Where were you
when Mark got whacked?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.460
With the cops.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.859
On a Sunday night?

17:09.901 --> 17:11.501
Yeah, they dragged me in
about Mad Rich.

17:11.536 --> 17:12.455
Bullshit.

17:14.261 --> 17:16.261
What sort of homicide cop
works on a Sunday night?

17:16.296 --> 17:17.819
I swear, man.

17:23.381 --> 17:25.098
I gotta watch out, don't I, Benji?

17:28.941 --> 17:30.693
Who from?

17:32.901 --> 17:34.493
Don't ask, Dino.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.106
Yeah. Well, fuck 'em.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.781
If someone's got a death wish, mate,
tell them to bring it on.

17:41.816 --> 17:43.373
I can look after myself.

17:46.661 --> 17:49.106
Why would I waste my money
shooting a door?

17:49.141 --> 17:53.101
Carl's an arse-wiping shelf-stacker.
Forget him, Benj. It's Dino.

17:53.136 --> 17:55.626
Dino's messing with your brain.

17:55.661 --> 17:57.866
First he tells you
I'm shooting doors.

17:57.901 --> 17:59.901
Then he reckons he got
dragged down the cop shop

17:59.936 --> 18:01.346
at, what, 8:30 on a Sunday night?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.461
You don't believe that crap.
I know you don't.

18:03.496 --> 18:04.906
I'll tell you what happened.

18:04.941 --> 18:07.821
Carl's had a set against my boys
since they shot him in the guts.

18:07.856 --> 18:09.786
Then Dino starts working for Carl.

18:09.821 --> 18:14.381
And to get in good
with his new boss, killed Mark.

18:14.416 --> 18:16.426
That's it - end of story.

18:16.461 --> 18:18.381
Just had a phone call
from the Ferret.

18:18.416 --> 18:19.346
Hmm?

18:19.381 --> 18:21.101
You know the Ferret.
He's a Perth bikie.

18:21.136 --> 18:22.821
He says Tony Mokbel's
running around town

18:22.856 --> 18:24.266
telling everyone he's a dog.

18:24.301 --> 18:27.701
So he's gonna fly in on the weekend.
I said I'd set up a meeting.

18:27.736 --> 18:29.741
So can you get me
a contact number for Mokbel?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.421
Or a contact or something? Andrew.

18:31.456 --> 18:33.618
Hey? Yep, yep. Sure.

18:33.653 --> 18:35.746
Take Lew with you.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.375
And Andrew,
can you give back the car?

18:39.701 --> 18:41.139
Alright.

18:41.174 --> 18:42.578
Let's go.

18:47.661 --> 18:49.106
This is the phone

18:49.141 --> 18:51.221
Mark Moran had in his pocket
when he was shot.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.101
What, he had two phones?
Yeah.

18:53.136 --> 18:54.546
And the tech guys tell me

18:54.581 --> 18:56.981
that someone who really does know
what they're doing with these things

18:57.016 --> 18:59.181
has modified this
so he doesn't receive an account.

18:59.216 --> 19:00.746
What, so no bill on that phone?

19:00.781 --> 19:04.821
No bill. But there is a text message
saying, "Meet me at 8:00pm."

19:04.856 --> 19:08.860
What, from Carl?
No. 'Vince'.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.539
Let's call Vince, shall we?

19:13.821 --> 19:15.981
It'll be in the address book.

19:16.016 --> 19:17.506
There.

19:17.541 --> 19:19.506
Hi. You've called Vince Love.

19:19.541 --> 19:22.181
I can't answer the phone right now,
but if you leave a message...

19:22.216 --> 19:23.786
Drug squad?

19:23.821 --> 19:26.821
I was stolen the Friday before
Mark Moran was killed.

19:26.856 --> 19:29.701
That's a copy of
the damage and loss form.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.506
See?

19:31.541 --> 19:34.941
So whoever stole it sent a message,
knowing he'd think it was me.

19:34.976 --> 19:38.341
What is your phone number
doing in a phone owned by Mark Moran?

19:38.376 --> 19:41.141
Well, we were using him
to get to Mokbel.

19:41.176 --> 19:42.586
So obviously whoever killed him

19:42.621 --> 19:44.901
knew enough to know that
if he thought it was me,

19:44.936 --> 19:46.501
he'd come and meet us.

19:46.536 --> 19:47.946
Thanks, mate.

19:47.981 --> 19:49.941
Well, if there's anything else,
just let me know.

19:49.976 --> 19:51.499
Go the Hawks.
Cheers.

19:55.341 --> 19:57.906
Now, while still
keeping an open mind,

19:57.941 --> 20:00.781
it's a fair bet to say that Carl
stole that phone and texted Mark.

20:00.816 --> 20:01.746
No.

20:01.781 --> 20:03.981
Apparently those text messages,
you can trace where they're from.

20:04.016 --> 20:05.466
And unfortunately for Vince Love,

20:05.501 --> 20:07.706
that one originated right here
in St Kilda Road.

20:07.741 --> 20:10.301
So what, you think that he faked
the phone being stolen

20:10.336 --> 20:11.986
and sent the text himself?

20:12.021 --> 20:13.621
That'd make him
an accessory to murder.

20:13.656 --> 20:14.666
Circumstantially.

20:14.701 --> 20:17.098
But how do we prove
that he deliberately set Mark up?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.496
I'm handing this whole thing
over to Ethical Standards.

20:28.541 --> 20:29.986
All you gotta do is turn up.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.821
Yeah, alright, Mick.
I'll be there, huh? All good.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.078
Oi, Tone.
Hey, Carl.

20:34.113 --> 20:36.266
What'd Mick want?

20:36.301 --> 20:39.146
Oh, just this biker prick
from Perth, right? The Ferret.

20:39.181 --> 20:42.821
He's a bit pissed off 'cause I called
him a dog, which he fucking is.

20:42.856 --> 20:44.741
Anyway, Mick's organising a meeting
to sort it out.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.706
Be careful, Tone.

20:46.741 --> 20:49.381
It's alright, Mick'll be there.
It's all on the level. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.421
I mean, I trust him.
I trust him. It's alright.

20:51.456 --> 20:53.386
Oi, they shot my house up, you know?

20:53.421 --> 20:56.221
Everyone knows you and Mark
weren't exactly the best of buddies.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.061
You get a bit jumpy
sometimes, don't you?

20:58.096 --> 20:59.541
Mmm.
Eh? That's good!

20:59.576 --> 21:01.099
It's alright.

21:02.541 --> 21:03.986
Look at that.

21:04.021 --> 21:06.079
Carl, I swear, one day,
even if it kills me,

21:06.114 --> 21:08.138
I'm gonna find out
where those legs finish.

21:09.181 --> 21:11.301
I've got her working
in one of my salons now.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.266
Yeah?

21:12.301 --> 21:13.781
Fuck, I'm a cunning
bastard sometimes.

21:20.021 --> 21:21.781
Benji.

21:21.816 --> 21:23.506
Lola.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.146
Seen you around a bit, haven't I?

21:25.181 --> 21:28.481
I used to dance at Bar 20.
Ah! That's right.

21:28.516 --> 21:31.781
So you would've seen me
there a bit too, eh?

21:31.816 --> 21:33.506
Yeah.

21:33.541 --> 21:35.661
I haven't been rude
or nothing, have I?

21:35.696 --> 21:36.650
No.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.201
A bit low on chips there.

21:40.236 --> 21:42.021
I wasn't a few hours ago.

21:42.056 --> 21:43.454
Uh-huh.

21:50.261 --> 21:53.741
If you win, you owe me
the kiss back, yeah?

21:53.776 --> 21:57.706
A grand?
Mmm.

21:57.741 --> 21:59.971
You sure?
I'm betting on a win.

22:01.301 --> 22:03.292
Don't you go anywhere.

22:06.261 --> 22:08.536
Hey, hey, hey...

22:10.741 --> 22:12.186
<i>... you got any coke?</i>

22:12.221 --> 22:14.361
I thought
you were out of drugs.

22:14.396 --> 22:16.466
Yeah, well, Mick's not into 'em.

22:16.501 --> 22:20.494
Hey, Benji, remember that day
we talked about hearing a voice?

22:22.061 --> 22:23.266
What voice? What?

22:23.301 --> 22:26.021
We had to get some money
off some poor schmuck who owed PK.

22:26.056 --> 22:28.741
And after we cleaned him up,
you talked about hearing a voice.

22:28.776 --> 22:29.706
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:29.741 --> 22:32.421
And I said, "Yeah, it's like
this voice that's inside your head.

22:32.456 --> 22:35.101
"It's talking to you. It's telling you
that you've gotta finish it.

22:35.136 --> 22:38.101
"If the dog deserves it,
you can't be weak.

22:38.136 --> 22:39.666
"You can't listen to the dog.

22:39.701 --> 22:42.861
"You gotta give it to him
'cause he deserves it.

22:42.896 --> 22:44.866
"He's gotta take it."

22:44.901 --> 22:47.301
You know what that is,
don't you, mate?

22:47.336 --> 22:49.337
That's the devil.

22:51.101 --> 22:53.376
Let's find out
where this Lewis Moran is, yeah?

22:55.061 --> 22:57.101
I'm hearing the voice, mate.

22:57.136 --> 22:58.546
You are too, yeah?

22:58.581 --> 23:01.381
100 grand is a big prize, yeah?

23:01.416 --> 23:02.981
Take it.

23:12.221 --> 23:14.266
I lost.

23:14.301 --> 23:17.378
That's OK.
I'm so, so sorry.

23:17.413 --> 23:20.455
You know what you owe me now?

23:21.501 --> 23:22.826
What?

23:22.861 --> 23:24.941
A dance.

23:27.741 --> 23:28.890
Sure.

23:40.821 --> 23:42.981
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

23:43.016 --> 23:45.106
We've been told no way, Lola.

23:45.141 --> 23:47.266
Come on, buddy, relax. She's with me.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.821
I don't give a fuck who she's with,
she's not coming inside.

23:49.856 --> 23:52.461
Come on!
I said fuck off, you cheap tramp.

23:52.496 --> 23:54.053
Argh!

23:57.621 --> 23:59.054
Shit!

24:09.021 --> 24:10.517
Are you alright?
Yeah.

24:10.552 --> 24:12.014
Are you sure?
Yeah.

24:15.061 --> 24:18.053
Relax, babe. You alright?
Yeah.

24:22.021 --> 24:24.012
Wow!

24:25.861 --> 24:27.340
Come here.

24:28.781 --> 24:31.381
Snazzy piece of art.

24:31.416 --> 24:32.575
Nice, huh?

24:34.021 --> 24:35.498
Hey?

24:35.533 --> 24:36.975
Yeah.

24:38.541 --> 24:40.677
Hey, no, no.

24:40.712 --> 24:42.813
Don't do that.

24:44.341 --> 24:46.781
Let's just talk for a bit.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.876
You wanna talk?

24:48.911 --> 24:50.936
Yeah, I do.

24:52.661 --> 24:54.094
I like you.

24:56.301 --> 24:58.506
Really?
Yeah.

24:58.541 --> 25:01.666
I wanna find out more about you.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.981
I'm not doing
anything else for a while.

25:05.016 --> 25:07.701
Me neither.

25:07.736 --> 25:09.259
No.

25:10.341 --> 25:11.854
Hey.

25:24.461 --> 25:25.941
Apparently,
with those text messages,

25:25.976 --> 25:27.386
you can trace where they're from

25:27.421 --> 25:30.101
and unfortunately for Vince Love,
that one originated right here,

25:30.136 --> 25:31.773
at St Kilda Road.

25:37.101 --> 25:38.617
Dino.

25:38.652 --> 25:40.134
Hmm?

25:41.861 --> 25:43.986
God, he was at St Kilda Road.

25:44.021 --> 25:47.261
That's why he dragged me in
on a Sunday night.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.221
He texted, Carl shot.

26:03.941 --> 26:07.541
I moved down to Melbourne
with a junkie boyfriend.

26:07.576 --> 26:10.706
And he was shit.

26:10.741 --> 26:13.539
And then there was someone else.

26:14.621 --> 26:17.215
And every time
I hook up with someone,

26:17.250 --> 26:19.810
they tell me they're thinking of me.

26:22.021 --> 26:25.461
But they never do, you know?

26:25.496 --> 26:27.666
They never do.

26:27.701 --> 26:30.374
Everyone lets you down eventually.

26:31.901 --> 26:34.369
Just gotta get used to it, I guess.

26:38.341 --> 26:39.774
Am I boring you?

26:40.901 --> 26:43.017
This is really boring, isn't it?

27:00.621 --> 27:03.141
I gotta do something.

27:03.176 --> 27:05.860
I'll be back.

27:08.581 --> 27:10.906
OK.
Could be a while, though. Alright?

27:10.941 --> 27:14.621
If you need anything,
you just put it on the room.

27:14.656 --> 27:17.221
Anything?
Anything.

27:19.061 --> 27:21.101
Enjoy yourself, alright?

27:21.136 --> 27:23.251
I'll try.
OK.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.296
Hey, Dino, you at home?

27:38.581 --> 27:40.541
I got a piece to do Lewis.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.755
Yeah, well, you drive.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.935
I'll meet you in 15. OK.

29:19.261 --> 29:21.061
Street's back that way.

29:21.096 --> 29:22.636
Two?
Yeah.

29:22.671 --> 29:24.176
Alright.

29:26.581 --> 29:28.060
Hey, boss.
Morning.

29:31.261 --> 29:34.741
Dino Dibra?
Yeah, bugger it.

29:34.776 --> 29:36.218
What?

29:36.253 --> 29:37.626
Nothing.

29:37.661 --> 29:40.221
When did this happen?

29:40.256 --> 29:42.066
A few hours ago.

29:42.101 --> 29:44.661
Lots of neighbours heard the shots
but no-one saw anything.

29:44.696 --> 29:48.893
Shells?
18 of them, from all round.

29:50.221 --> 29:53.133
What the hell
are we dealing with now?

31:03.752 --> 31:05.677
So, what do you fuckin' want?

31:05.712 --> 31:07.552
Just a routine inquiry,
Mrs Williams.

31:07.587 --> 31:09.397
Routine, my arse.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.877
It's about Dino, isn't it?

31:10.912 --> 31:12.812
Were you friends with Dino?
Oh, we knew him.

31:12.847 --> 31:14.712
Any idea who might
have wanted him dead?

31:14.747 --> 31:16.237
Fuck off.

31:16.272 --> 31:18.072
Anyone he might have
talked about, Carl?

31:18.107 --> 31:19.037
Nah.

31:19.072 --> 31:20.552
You can't help us at all?
Nah.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.917
Nah, mate. Sorry.

31:21.952 --> 31:24.832
He was a fun guy. Always good
for a laugh and that, you know.

31:24.867 --> 31:27.037
We only knew him socially.

31:27.072 --> 31:28.792
Any idea what he did for a living?

31:28.827 --> 31:30.277
No idea, mate.

31:30.312 --> 31:32.952
No idea?
Wouldn't have a clue.

31:32.987 --> 31:35.404
Someone chuck a mental, did they?

31:35.439 --> 31:37.822
Chuck you if you don't fuck off.

31:59.272 --> 32:01.197
You got the cash?

32:01.232 --> 32:04.517
Give me a break.
He's barely reached the morgue.

32:04.552 --> 32:06.992
Hey, listen, Lewis. You wanted it
organised, I got it organised, OK?

32:07.027 --> 32:08.549
Now the guy wants his money.

32:08.584 --> 32:10.068
Yeah, he'll get his money.

32:10.103 --> 32:12.047
It's us, Benj. Don't panic.

32:12.082 --> 32:13.957
When?
Soon! Very soon.

32:13.992 --> 32:16.870
Look, if we have a good weekend
this weekend for business...

32:20.072 --> 32:21.492
Next month.
No, no!

32:21.527 --> 32:22.877
Next month some time...

32:22.912 --> 32:25.792
Listen, the deal was a lump sum,
wasn't it?

32:25.827 --> 32:28.068
The deal was an overall figure.

32:28.103 --> 32:30.310
I'll stick with it, mate. Promise.

32:47.152 --> 32:48.872
Tony's just got here too.

32:48.907 --> 32:50.557
You know Tony Mokbel?

32:50.592 --> 32:53.712
Benji.
Benji, hey. Heard a lot about you.

32:53.747 --> 32:55.703
Alright, so what are we doing?

32:57.712 --> 33:00.272
Yeah, well, mate,
it's just a beat-up, alright?

33:00.307 --> 33:01.989
I'm sorry. OK?

33:02.024 --> 33:03.637
So we all sorted?

33:03.672 --> 33:06.072
We're sorted. I heard he was a dog.
He's not a dog.

33:06.107 --> 33:07.949
Don't sound like you mean it!

33:09.952 --> 33:11.117
Tony, sit down.

33:11.152 --> 33:13.152
Get some feed going here.
Get some pizza, thanks.

33:13.187 --> 33:15.152
Some ham and pineapple, whatever -
four seasons.

33:15.187 --> 33:17.791
But sit down.
Alright, Mick. Go easy.

33:19.232 --> 33:21.063
So who else has been saying it, Tony?

33:22.352 --> 33:25.072
Well, mate, you know,
be honest with you -

33:25.107 --> 33:26.997
been hearing it from everywhere.

33:27.032 --> 33:30.472
Maybe everyone's just been
telling me what I just told them.

33:30.507 --> 33:32.637
Fuck, you know what?
That's what it is.

33:32.672 --> 33:35.712
<i>Maybe I started the rumour myself...
... and I didn't realise it.</i>

33:35.747 --> 33:37.157
'Cause it's either that, mate,

33:37.192 --> 33:39.397
or everyone in the whole
fucking world knows you're a dog

33:39.432 --> 33:42.352
and I'm the only prick brave enough
to stand here today and say so.

33:42.387 --> 33:44.157
I'll put my hand up. You're a dog!

33:44.192 --> 33:46.832
What do you want? You want me
to hide under the fucking table?

33:46.867 --> 33:49.072
I just keep hearing
the guy's a fucking dog.

33:54.712 --> 33:56.277
In the criminal world,

33:56.312 --> 33:59.032
calling a man a 'dog'
is the worst insult of all.

33:59.067 --> 34:01.637
Who knows why Tony Mokbel did it.

34:01.672 --> 34:05.117
Why did he turn up doped
to the eyeballs in the first place?

34:05.152 --> 34:08.512
Whatever his sins, it's doubtful
he deserved such a vicious beating.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.871
Benji Veniamin couldn't understand
why Big Mick had let it happen.

34:11.907 --> 34:13.952
Hey! Alright, mate. Come on.

34:13.987 --> 34:15.837
Yeah, get him out of here.

34:15.871 --> 34:18.101
Giovanni, we're gonna
need a coffee here.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.572
"Come to a meeting, Tony."
What, so you can fucking belt me?

34:23.607 --> 34:26.752
If I set you up, you'd still be
on the floor, you wanker.

34:26.786 --> 34:28.277
I organised a lunch for you

34:28.312 --> 34:30.357
so you could deal with this
in a gentlemanly way.

34:30.391 --> 34:33.032
Instead, you cruise in here,
drugged up to the eyeballs,

34:33.067 --> 34:35.589
behaving like
the biggest dickhead in town.

34:35.623 --> 34:38.112
Who the hell
do you think you are, Mokbel?

34:38.147 --> 34:40.556
Argh, fuck.
You're a fucking nobody.

34:40.592 --> 34:43.512
You get him to the doctor.
You know that bloke?

34:43.547 --> 34:46.036
Then you get him a room at Crown.

34:46.072 --> 34:48.112
That's the bloody problem -
they start taking their own gear

34:48.147 --> 34:50.306
and it just fucking completely
knocks them around.

34:54.871 --> 34:57.067
Andrew, after this - the car.

35:11.352 --> 35:13.532
No, no. That's good. Yep.

35:13.567 --> 35:15.677
You right?
Yeah.

35:15.712 --> 35:18.067
You don't want a drink or nothing?
No.

35:19.752 --> 35:21.629
Ah, fuck.

35:26.032 --> 35:28.107
Mate, if that wasn't
a fucking set-up.

35:28.142 --> 35:30.182
Eh? I mean, you saw it.
You were there.

35:32.872 --> 35:37.072
That Mick Gatto. Man of his word, huh?
What a load of crap.

35:37.107 --> 35:38.517
Mate, he's jealous

35:38.552 --> 35:40.952
'cause I make fuckin' 10 times
more money than he's ever made.

35:40.987 --> 35:43.597
Tony, fuck me dead.
What'd they do to you, mate?

35:43.632 --> 35:46.992
Shit, Tone, you look like crap, mate.
You gonna be alright?

35:47.027 --> 35:49.877
Listen, that Carlton Crew,

35:49.912 --> 35:52.112
mate, there's a class act, huh?

35:52.147 --> 35:53.237
Bastards, mate.

35:53.272 --> 35:57.152
Fucking Italians - all think they're
big shots, every single one of them.

35:57.187 --> 35:58.983
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.592
Hey, good talking to you.
You too.

36:03.627 --> 36:05.837
We'll talk again.
Yeah, yeah.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.872
Stuff's in the bag, yeah?
Yeah, give it to him.

36:08.907 --> 36:10.712
Oi, mate.
Yeah, what?

36:10.747 --> 36:12.477
Thanks a lot, yeah.

36:12.512 --> 36:14.672
It's a pleasure.
Yeah, thanks from me too.

36:14.707 --> 36:15.797
Righto.

36:15.832 --> 36:18.477
I like your tats. They're sexy.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.077
How much do you want
for bringing him around?

36:20.112 --> 36:22.226
Nah, don't worry about that.
Nah, bullshit, nothing, mate.

36:22.261 --> 36:24.341
You could've put him in a cab
or anything. Two grand alright?

36:27.032 --> 36:28.397
Thank you.

36:28.432 --> 36:31.032
I just don't want you pissing off,
thinking we owe you something.

36:31.067 --> 36:32.997
So if you want any more...
No, no.

36:33.032 --> 36:35.597
Listen, that's fine.
It's much appreciated.

36:35.632 --> 36:39.192
Mate, I'll tell you what,
at these rates, you need anything,

36:39.227 --> 36:40.637
give me a call.

36:40.672 --> 36:43.311
What's Mick
gonna say about that?

36:48.112 --> 36:51.077
I'm not his slave.
I go where the work is.

36:51.112 --> 36:54.627
So, as I said, you need anything,
give me a call.

36:58.712 --> 37:01.021
Alright.

37:02.632 --> 37:04.197
Right.

37:04.232 --> 37:05.677
Catch youse later.

37:05.712 --> 37:07.317
Hey, Andrew.
It's Benji.

37:07.352 --> 37:11.186
What?
Benji. My friends call me Benji.

37:13.552 --> 37:15.031
From me.

37:16.712 --> 37:17.781
Thank you.

37:19.552 --> 37:21.912
And if you want any more, just call.

37:21.947 --> 37:23.345
Righto.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.744
Enjoy.

37:26.992 --> 37:29.142
I like him. He's nice.

37:47.392 --> 37:51.752
Hi, it's Lola.
I just wanted to call and say thank you.

37:51.787 --> 37:54.672
I never thought
someone I was so scared of

37:54.707 --> 37:57.167
could turn out to be my oxygen.

37:57.202 --> 37:59.627
I'll love you forever, Benj.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.357
Did you get the milk?
Yeah.

38:06.392 --> 38:09.112
Thanks, darling.
There you go, Mama.

38:09.147 --> 38:10.637
Good boy.

38:10.672 --> 38:12.230
Hey, did you hear about Dino?

38:13.712 --> 38:15.252
Yeah, I did.

38:15.287 --> 38:16.757
Bastards.

38:16.792 --> 38:19.386
It's that drug world, son.

40:50.672 --> 40:53.352
Andrew Veniamin
could kill for loyalty,

40:53.387 --> 40:55.237
be loyal for money

40:55.272 --> 40:57.077
and take money for a kill.

40:57.112 --> 41:00.661
And he was the most loved
murderer in Melbourne.
