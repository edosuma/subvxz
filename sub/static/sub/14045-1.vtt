WEBVTT

00:05.912 --> 00:07.447
Chopper's on its way!

00:07.481 --> 00:09.143
Rescue says they're about 20 minutes out!

00:09.177 --> 00:12.215
He doesn't have 20 minutes!
We got to get him now!

00:12.249 --> 00:14.359
Okay, I'll rig up and join you!

00:20.056 --> 00:22.551
Huh?

00:22.584 --> 00:25.239
<i>Yo soy un doctor. Me llamo T.C.</i>

00:33.305 --> 00:35.543
Okay. He's in shock.
He's got an open wound.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.007
Tib-Fib fracture. He needs
to get out of here ASAP.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.232
I'll give you a signal to pull us up.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.047
And tell the chopper to get his ass here.

00:42.118 --> 00:44.219
All right, uh, use this
cream three times a day,

00:44.263 --> 00:45.967
- and the rash will clear right up, okay?
- Okay.

00:45.991 --> 00:47.695
Hey, and thank you for your
service to this country.

00:47.719 --> 00:49.252
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:49.287 --> 00:51.237
<i>Telephone for Dr. Cummings.</i>

00:51.270 --> 00:52.740
<i>Paging Dr. Cummings.</i>

00:52.775 --> 00:55.620
Hello, this is Dr. C... oh, gross!

00:55.655 --> 00:57.157
Kenny!

00:57.190 --> 00:58.629
Wherever you are, you're dead!

00:58.663 --> 01:00.612
I wouldn't take that crap if I were you.

01:00.647 --> 01:02.180
Okay, give him another 15 minutes rest

01:02.215 --> 01:03.630
then send him home with the antibiotics.

01:03.654 --> 01:05.060
- Thanks, Mollie.
- You're welcome.

01:05.095 --> 01:08.548
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Check this out. Night shift special.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.767
Two guys fought a duel with
nail guns outside of the Alamo.

01:10.791 --> 01:13.092
And the first guy missed,
second guy didn't.

01:13.127 --> 01:15.301
- Well, I hope he already had kids.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.335 --> 01:17.573
- Right.
- No, please, stop! I...

01:17.606 --> 01:20.197
I-I don't know how you
handled all this paperwork

01:20.230 --> 01:22.639
- when you were in charge.
- I do not miss that part of the job.

01:22.663 --> 01:25.637
Jordan, I need you! Male
and female, both 40s.

01:25.671 --> 01:27.525
Status post-penetrating rebar injury

01:27.558 --> 01:29.668
- while riding a motorcycle.
- Okay. Trauma 1.

01:29.703 --> 01:32.389
Uh... rebar? What... flew off
the back of a truck on 410.

01:32.423 --> 01:34.533
Male with a through-and-through
skull injury.

01:34.566 --> 01:36.644
G.C.S. of
4-6-5, somehow.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.437
Female with a penetrating throat injury.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.165
She's tachy. B.P. of 90 systolic.

01:40.199 --> 01:41.989
So far her sats are holding.

01:42.023 --> 01:43.749
What's with the splint?

01:43.783 --> 01:45.732
Gross abnormality of the distal radius

01:45.767 --> 01:47.108
from the fall. It's closed.

01:47.143 --> 01:48.431
Okay, this is gonna need sutures!

01:48.455 --> 01:49.710
All right, I'm on it. All right,

01:49.734 --> 01:51.374
let's get trauma down
here for a consult ASAP.

01:51.398 --> 01:52.773
Dr. Cummings is in surgery.

01:52.806 --> 01:54.191
I got to call in Dr. Chavez,
the new night surgeon.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.684
Hell of a first shift for him.

01:55.719 --> 01:57.615
Thank you. Really could've
used T.C. on this one.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.079
He never should have been suspended.

01:59.111 --> 02:01.604
You don't take a doc like
that out of the E.R. agreed.

02:01.639 --> 02:04.165
But you know T.C. can't
stop him from working.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.876
Ah... hold on! He's choking.

02:07.911 --> 02:09.262
Okay, I got you. Come on.

02:09.286 --> 02:11.365
You got something in there. Cough. Hmm?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.220
Hey! What's going on?

02:13.255 --> 02:14.917
He's got partial airway occlusion!

02:14.950 --> 02:17.285
If we take him up any further,
his airway's gonna block!

02:17.414 --> 02:19.524
I need you! He's completely obstructed!

02:23.846 --> 02:25.573
Coming down with your med kit!

02:30.569 --> 02:31.623
Son of a bitch.

02:31.657 --> 02:32.615
He's got cotton balls
stuck down his throat.

02:32.648 --> 02:35.207
- Hand me a j-wire.
- Cotton balls?

02:35.241 --> 02:37.223
Yeah. Some coyotes across the borders,

02:37.257 --> 02:39.495
they soak cotton balls
in juice to feed the kids

02:39.529 --> 02:40.583
instead of food.

02:40.617 --> 02:41.968
But they don't digest, so they choke easy.

02:41.992 --> 02:43.879
Come on, get in there. Get in there.

02:43.912 --> 02:45.895
He's turning blue.

02:45.929 --> 02:47.111
- You got this?
- Yeah.

02:47.144 --> 02:49.479
I need to clear his airway
with the retrograde j-wire.

02:49.513 --> 02:52.007
Ah, there we go. There we go.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.607
Hang in there. Hang in there.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.007
There we go. Yes!

02:56.040 --> 02:58.215
You're all good. Good job, buddy, come on.

02:58.249 --> 02:59.367
Yeah, welcome back.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.331
Okay, let's make our way back up.

03:01.366 --> 03:03.603
Nice and slowly.

03:03.638 --> 03:05.267
Okay. Up...

03:06.923 --> 03:08.947
Sir, hold still! Don't
even move an inch, okay?

03:08.999 --> 03:11.173
Your wife's being sedated on pain medicine.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.943
We need to keep you lucid
to follow your neuro exams,

03:12.967 --> 03:14.512
so we can't give you
any pain meds right now.

03:14.536 --> 03:16.688
- I don't feel any pain.
- None? What about your wrist?

03:16.712 --> 03:18.278
I don't care about my wrists!

03:18.311 --> 03:20.454
This is all my fault!
She hates the motorcycle.

03:20.487 --> 03:22.223
- I talked her...
- Sir, you need to be calm.

03:22.247 --> 03:23.760
You keep moving around,
you're gonna endanger

03:23.784 --> 03:26.149
- both of you, okay?
- Okay.

03:26.854 --> 03:28.646
Okay, I'm done here. Let's get some...

03:28.679 --> 03:30.789
- dressing on it.
- Dr. Chavez, I presume.

03:30.804 --> 03:33.009
- Joey.
- I can take that, Doctor.

03:33.044 --> 03:34.460
Scott will be down as soon as he can.

03:34.484 --> 03:36.370
He's still elbows deep
in a splenectomy case.

03:36.404 --> 03:38.578
Everybody, huddle up. Let's
get some information here.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.700
We need to get this helmet
off. Are they both medicated?

03:40.724 --> 03:43.186
The wife is. The husband is
conscious but reporting no pain.

03:43.219 --> 03:44.603
- Really?
- But he is pretty freaked out.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.364
All right, I'm gonna work
on getting the helmet off.

03:46.388 --> 03:47.932
You guys complete the
secondary survey on the wife.

03:47.956 --> 03:50.076
- All right? Let's roll.
- You guys okay here? I'm getting paged.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.091
- Yeah, we got this.
- Uh, what's the patient's name?

03:52.115 --> 03:53.265
- Craig.
- Craig.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.546
Mind if I borrow this? Thanks.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.818
All right, Craig. You do yoga?

03:56.852 --> 03:59.262
- Uh, n-no.
- No?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.234
All right. Well, you're
going to learn right now.

04:01.268 --> 04:03.121
- How's that sound?
- Uh... Mm...

04:03.156 --> 04:05.266
All right, just follow my pen here.

04:05.386 --> 04:06.696
Good job, Craig.

04:06.730 --> 04:09.448
Now, I want you to focus on your breathing.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.624
Sound of the saw can be a bit unnerving,

04:11.658 --> 04:14.696
and breath is the bridge
between the mind and the body.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.978
The longer you exhale, the
more relaxed you're going to be.

04:17.002 --> 04:18.120
Can you do that?

04:18.153 --> 04:20.872
I'll try.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.920
Drill, please. Thank you.

04:22.953 --> 04:25.608
<i>Namaste, everybody.</i>

04:28.588 --> 04:31.306
So, the new night surgeon...
Chavez... what's he like?

04:31.340 --> 04:32.874
Very Dr. Granola.

04:32.908 --> 04:34.858
A little too touchy-feely for my taste.

04:34.892 --> 04:37.546
Oh, God, I forgot
it's Ragosa's first night back.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.252
That's just what I need.
Another pain in my ass.

04:39.276 --> 04:41.066
Evening, Gentlemen.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.082
Mollie. Topher!

04:43.116 --> 04:44.746
Ha ha!

04:44.780 --> 04:46.954
Mm! Good to have you back!

04:46.988 --> 04:48.052
Hmm. How's the wife and kids?

04:48.076 --> 04:49.258
- Good. They're good.
- Good.

04:49.292 --> 04:50.794
Good, good. Drew.

04:50.828 --> 04:52.330
How's Rick?

04:52.364 --> 04:53.844
I hear you guys moved in together, right?

04:53.868 --> 04:56.074
He's doing as well as could be expected.

04:56.108 --> 04:58.026
Should get his prosthetic leg any week.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.042
You tell him to never give up hope.

05:00.076 --> 05:01.290
I didn't,

05:01.324 --> 05:03.114
and this guy right here didn't, either.

05:03.148 --> 05:05.098
- Isn't that right, Topher?
- Yeah.

05:05.132 --> 05:07.883
- Everything good with you?
- Yeah. Couldn't be better.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.602
You survive a tumor, cheat death,

05:10.636 --> 05:12.714
everything else seems like small potatoes.

05:12.748 --> 05:14.506
We dodged a bullet, Topher.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.682
Mm. Well, you didn't,

05:16.716 --> 05:18.922
- but you get my metaphor, right?
- Yeah.

05:18.956 --> 05:20.394
- We're survivors.
- I get it.

05:20.428 --> 05:21.780
Anyway...

05:21.804 --> 05:24.362
First day back, lots to do.

05:24.396 --> 05:26.762
- See you boys around.
- Okay.

05:27.179 --> 05:29.162
Okay, that was weird, right?

05:29.195 --> 05:30.409
I don't know who that was.

05:30.444 --> 05:32.490
Uh... hey! Hey! I need a trauma room.

05:32.523 --> 05:33.866
- Oh... trauma 3!
- Okay.

05:33.899 --> 05:35.124
Found this little guy in the wild,

05:35.148 --> 05:36.372
probably abandoned by a coyote,

05:36.396 --> 05:37.642
with an open tibia fracture,

05:37.740 --> 05:39.658
an infected leg wound,
and severe dehydration.

05:39.693 --> 05:42.219
He's gotten 40cc per kilogram bolus

05:42.253 --> 05:43.627
through a sterile I.O. line.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.259
Oh, come on. Send off a C.B.C.,

05:45.293 --> 05:48.075
a C.M.P., and get Ortho here ASAP.

05:48.109 --> 05:49.643
Here we go, here we go...

05:49.677 --> 05:51.349
- Tee, I hate to break it to you...
- All right, I'll draw the blood.

05:51.373 --> 05:52.693
But technically you're still suspended.

05:52.717 --> 05:55.787
Right. Sorry. Kenny,
Dr. Zia is gonna ask you

05:55.821 --> 05:57.419
to start Ancef and Gent prophylaxis

05:57.452 --> 05:59.499
for the open fracture
and the wound infection.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.682
Got it.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.698
Dr. Zia's also gonna tell
you that Dr. Callahan,

06:02.733 --> 06:04.596
although a brilliant doctor,
has been a pain in his ass

06:04.620 --> 06:05.771
since the day they met.

06:05.805 --> 06:07.485
Yeah, but you still love me, huh?

06:07.904 --> 06:10.493
I'm gonna slowly take this off of you.

06:10.528 --> 06:14.077
Okay, the bar is stable for now.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.774
All right.

06:15.807 --> 06:17.758
How you doing, Craig? You feeling any pain?

06:17.792 --> 06:19.550
It's fine. Mary, how are you doing?

06:19.584 --> 06:21.790
- She's good. She's resting.
- Can I hold her hand?

06:21.824 --> 06:23.134
Of course.

06:24.928 --> 06:27.070
Surgery took a lot longer than expected.

06:27.104 --> 06:29.032
- What do we got here, Krista?
- A reduced wrist fracture on the man,

06:29.056 --> 06:30.366
a sutured knee lac on the woman,

06:30.399 --> 06:31.943
and a large piece of rebar
causing all types of problems.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.288
So what we need to do is separate the two

06:33.312 --> 06:35.240
- without killing them.
- I don't want to cut them apart

06:35.264 --> 06:37.469
without seeing what
structures may be damaged.

06:37.504 --> 06:39.774
There's no way we can fit
them in the C.T. like that.

06:39.807 --> 06:41.447
Well, what if we cut it
at both ends? Maybe...

06:41.471 --> 06:42.792
We'll handle it from here, Jordan.

06:42.816 --> 06:44.896
This a surgical case now.
You can go back to the E.R.

06:45.919 --> 06:46.973
Okay.

06:48.352 --> 06:49.790
Let me know if you need anything.

06:49.824 --> 06:51.880
All right, we're gonna clear
the bottom half of this helmet.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.223
Let's be ready to stabilize his head.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.622
On my count, all right?

06:54.655 --> 06:56.734
<i>Woman on
P.A: Dr. Zia to trauma 1.</i>

06:56.768 --> 06:58.430
- Hey. Jordy, check this out...
- Hey.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.798
For throwback Thursday.

07:00.832 --> 07:03.486
What you got? Oh, wow!

07:03.520 --> 07:05.054
- Right?
- Sophomore year?

07:05.088 --> 07:07.774
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, we were so into the Spice Girls.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.630
Uh, uh, still into the Spice Girls.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.766
- That's right.
- So, uh, Scott still being a dick to you?

07:12.943 --> 07:15.342
Yeah. He's acting like...

07:15.375 --> 07:16.696
Like he moved down here and you dumped him

07:16.720 --> 07:18.253
to get back with T.C.?

07:18.288 --> 07:21.102
- Mm?
- Okay, I am not back together with T.C.

07:21.135 --> 07:23.278
and it is way more complicated than that.

07:23.311 --> 07:26.285
Complicated, T.C. No way.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.238
Well, it's better that
he's complicated than...

07:28.272 --> 07:31.054
What, boring?

07:31.277 --> 07:33.771
Our safest option without a scan

07:33.804 --> 07:36.778
is to cut the rebar as
close to you as possible,

07:36.813 --> 07:37.941
and that will keep the weight of the bar

07:37.965 --> 07:39.339
from shifting toward your side.

07:39.372 --> 07:41.675
So does that mean it shifts to her side?

07:41.709 --> 07:43.306
Wait... is it gonna be bad for Mary?

07:43.341 --> 07:44.725
There's potential respiratory distress

07:44.749 --> 07:46.251
and some damage to her vocal chords,

07:46.284 --> 07:48.298
but better that than
damage to your brain tissue,

07:48.333 --> 07:49.674
which can't be repaired.

07:49.709 --> 07:51.755
That can't happen. She's a schoolteacher.

07:51.788 --> 07:54.025
- She needs her voice!
- Craig, we respect your concern, sir,

07:54.029 --> 07:55.509
but you need to know the stakes here.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.291
If you have significant brain damage,

07:57.325 --> 07:58.603
you may not come out of this.

07:58.637 --> 08:00.651
Craig, you need to hear me.

08:00.685 --> 08:02.763
There are no great options here.

08:02.797 --> 08:05.771
There are going to be
risks no matter what we do.

08:05.805 --> 08:07.595
Now, you need to let go and trust us.

08:07.629 --> 08:09.365
We have more ways to help
her if she gets into trouble

08:09.389 --> 08:10.571
than if you do.

08:10.605 --> 08:11.979
I'll take that risk.

08:12.012 --> 08:14.091
No, Mary!

08:14.125 --> 08:16.939
If something happens to
you, I don't care if I live.

08:16.973 --> 08:18.731
I won't let them cut if it hurts you!

08:18.765 --> 08:20.181
Hey, you need to stop moving!

08:20.205 --> 08:21.259
Sats are down to 90!

08:21.293 --> 08:22.517
What's going on? What's beeping?

08:22.541 --> 08:23.701
The airway's filling with blood!

08:23.725 --> 08:24.715
Give me the...

08:24.749 --> 08:25.973
His moving dislodged the blood clot!

08:25.997 --> 08:27.147
Tell me what's going on!

08:27.181 --> 08:28.341
They need to be separated!
I'm cutting the rebar.

08:28.365 --> 08:29.909
- No, Mary!
- Hand me the bone saw, please.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.179
Tell me what's happening!

08:31.212 --> 08:32.938
Discussion over. She needs a trach now.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.123
Krista, prep the neck.

08:34.157 --> 08:36.938
- No...
- I need steriles.

08:38.157 --> 08:39.541
Topher, we're shorthanded out here.

08:39.565 --> 08:40.756
I need you to see an acute stoke patient.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.645
- When it rains, it pours, right?
- Krista, you're up.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.075
Okay, I'm on it.

08:44.109 --> 08:47.083
- Okay, suction.
- Help her! Help her! Mary!

08:47.117 --> 08:50.059
- All right, stabilize him.
- Oh, my God, help her, please!

08:50.160 --> 08:51.758
- Here we go.
- Mary!

08:51.792 --> 08:54.574
Aah!

08:56.000 --> 09:02.074

09:11.878 --> 09:14.276
Michael Ragosa.

09:14.310 --> 09:17.348
Yes, yes, Mr. Clark. I was just, uh,

09:17.383 --> 09:19.653
working on those numbers for you.

09:19.686 --> 09:21.796
And the new insurance mandate.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.036
And the medicare and medicaid
reimbursement projections.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.348
I'm all over it.

09:25.382 --> 09:26.981
Okay.

09:27.014 --> 09:29.476
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

09:29.510 --> 09:31.108
Well, I don't want to be a bother.

09:31.142 --> 09:33.070
It's just a sore neck thing,
but I've been waiting for, like,

09:33.094 --> 09:34.606
three months for an
appointment from the V.A.

09:34.630 --> 09:36.516
All right, Tricia, stop. Just... it's done.

09:36.550 --> 09:38.430
Go hang in the waiting
room, and I'll set it up.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.021
- Hey, T?
- Yeah?

09:40.054 --> 09:41.458
- Kid's doing better.
- Oh, great.

09:41.478 --> 09:43.726
Listen, could you make sure to
see my friend Tricia tonight?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.412
She's a big help to me in therapy group.

09:45.447 --> 09:47.150
- I want to help her out.
- Yeah, of course, but we got to be careful now.

09:47.174 --> 09:48.613
Ragosa's back. He finds out

09:48.646 --> 09:50.853
- we're doing this off-book, we're done.
- Yeah.

09:50.887 --> 09:52.484
Okay? It's not...

09:52.519 --> 09:54.949
- Sure!
- No, it's exactly how...

09:54.983 --> 09:56.324
- T.C.
- Gwen.

09:56.359 --> 09:58.533
May I have a word, Dr. Alexander?

09:58.567 --> 10:00.164
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.574 --> 10:03.109
I like it when you stop by.

10:03.142 --> 10:04.719
- Well, actually, I have to bring in a patient.
- Mm.

10:04.743 --> 10:05.998
But I could go out and come back in

10:06.022 --> 10:07.439
and pretend like I came
here to see you, if you like.

10:07.463 --> 10:09.327
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey, T.C. What's up, man?

10:09.351 --> 10:11.684
- Hey, Paul. Hey.
- Hey. Okay. Good to see you, man.

10:11.719 --> 10:13.348
- Yeah.
- So, working on the vets.

10:13.383 --> 10:15.045
Uh, mum's the word on that one.

10:15.078 --> 10:17.700
Um, it's a bit busy,
but I got it, so... Cool.

10:17.735 --> 10:19.758
That's great. Can you make
sure to see my friend Tricia?

10:19.782 --> 10:21.509
- Yeah.
- See you around, buddy.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.278
So, uh, what do you think
of the new break room, right?

10:23.302 --> 10:25.071
You wanna... you wanna maybe
play some pool after the shift?

10:25.095 --> 10:26.287
- I'm pretty good.
- You know what, Paul?

10:26.311 --> 10:28.229
Maybe you should get a start on those vets.

10:28.262 --> 10:30.628
- Yeah, like now, even.
- Hey, uh, Jordan?

10:30.663 --> 10:31.909
A little help, s'il vous plaît,

10:31.942 --> 10:33.221
with the doctors' schedule.

10:33.254 --> 10:34.639
- Not so good with the paperwork.
- Right.

10:34.663 --> 10:36.900
He's been doing this for
weeks. Okay. Don't leave.

10:36.935 --> 10:37.935
No.

10:38.982 --> 10:41.221
So, just so you know, T.C.,

10:41.254 --> 10:42.821
if you hurt her again,

10:42.854 --> 10:44.389
you're gonna have to deal with me.

10:44.422 --> 10:46.661
Ah, easy, Gwennie. I'm not gonna hurt her.

10:46.694 --> 10:48.197
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.222
It's not like last time when
I came back from the war.

10:50.246 --> 10:51.525
You know it's different now.

10:51.558 --> 10:53.637
I'm taking it... slow.

10:53.747 --> 10:55.346
Like I said, hurt her,

10:55.379 --> 10:56.593
and you're dealing with me.

10:56.627 --> 10:58.994
Hey, Topher, I just got a
call from the courthouse.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.817
Some type of major crush injury?

11:00.851 --> 11:02.801
They said they can't
move him and he's critical

11:02.836 --> 11:04.380
- and needs a doctor.
- Jordan, you take this.

11:04.404 --> 11:06.770
- On it.
- All right, Gwen, we're up.

11:06.803 --> 11:08.690
Catch you later?

11:10.419 --> 11:12.274
Hey, Mollie.

11:12.307 --> 11:15.345
Um, where exactly was that crash injury?

11:16.391 --> 11:17.519
Guy got stuck in the elevator,

11:17.543 --> 11:18.735
panicked about being late for something,

11:18.759 --> 11:19.717
and tried to squeeze out.

11:19.751 --> 11:21.253
That's when the elevator moved and...

11:21.287 --> 11:23.173
somebody save him! Help, please!

11:23.207 --> 11:25.413
- You've got to...
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna do my best.

11:25.447 --> 11:26.949
He's my dad!

11:30.791 --> 11:32.357
Oh! Whoa!

11:32.391 --> 11:33.743
Let's go! We need more support!

11:33.767 --> 11:34.693
Shore it up! Shore it up!

11:34.727 --> 11:36.613
- You better work fast.
- Yeah.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.951
Block the cable so it doesn't move!

11:39.975 --> 11:41.477
How's she doing?

11:41.511 --> 11:43.877
Looking good. I'm incising the trachea.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.381
I'm ready with the trach tube.

11:45.415 --> 11:48.165
Okay.

11:48.199 --> 11:49.733
Tube's in.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.037
Inflating the balloon.

11:52.071 --> 11:54.533
All right. The bleeding has stopped.

11:54.567 --> 11:56.485
Virtual fist bumps all around.

11:56.519 --> 11:58.533
Thank you, Doctors.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.079
Now that we've got her airway secured,

12:00.103 --> 12:02.437
we can safely remove the
rebar from both of you.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.517
There's a neurosurgeon
waiting for you up in O.R. 1,

12:04.551 --> 12:05.775
and we're gonna take care of your wife

12:05.799 --> 12:08.229
- in O.R. 2 right next door.
- Thank you, Doctor.

12:12.871 --> 12:15.397
You should stretch in between surgeries.

12:15.431 --> 12:18.085
- Be good for you.
- All right.

12:18.119 --> 12:19.877
- You should try it.
- You ready, Mr. Woo?

12:19.911 --> 12:21.061
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:21.095 --> 12:22.821
There's a loud friction rub.

12:22.855 --> 12:24.431
- He's bleeding around his heart.
- Okay.

12:24.455 --> 12:25.509
What are you doing here?

12:25.543 --> 12:26.927
She was sent out on a
major crush case alone.

12:26.951 --> 12:28.591
I thought Jordan could use
the help of a good Samaritan.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.213
More like a good adrenaline junkie.

12:30.247 --> 12:31.471
I could definitely use the help.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.167
Okay, look, this poor man
is having labored breathing.

12:33.191 --> 12:34.415
He needs his airway stabilized,

12:34.439 --> 12:35.791
but I can't intubate him in this position.

12:35.815 --> 12:36.997
We have to go nasotracheal.

12:37.031 --> 12:38.255
I've done it a dozen times
before on the battlefield

12:38.279 --> 12:40.207
when a soldier can't be
moved. Best way to intubate.

12:40.231 --> 12:42.245
Gwen, can you hand me
a 6.0 endotracheal tube?

12:42.279 --> 12:44.005
I'll place a nasal airway for dilation.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.437
Can I also get some
blankets here to prop him up?

12:46.471 --> 12:48.325
We're gonna
take care of you, sir.

12:48.359 --> 12:50.245
It's gonna be okay.

12:52.344 --> 12:53.621
Hey! Oh!

12:53.656 --> 12:55.253
How's it going tonight?

12:55.287 --> 12:56.886
Well, you know what they say...

12:56.919 --> 12:58.784
a third of the time boring,
a third of the time regular,

12:58.808 --> 13:02.453
- a third of the time crazy.
- Ah, I see Jordan's got the crush injury

13:02.487 --> 13:04.031
on site, you just saw a stroke patient,

13:04.055 --> 13:06.645
and Drew is taking care of a sore throat.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.789
There something I can
help you with, Michael?

13:08.823 --> 13:10.645
No. Carry on.

13:12.023 --> 13:14.015
Well, actually, actually, uh,
if it's all right with you,

13:14.039 --> 13:15.926
I thought I'd hang out down here tonight.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.525
- Here?
- Yeah. You know,

13:17.559 --> 13:20.693
I learned a lot about
being a patient myself.

13:20.727 --> 13:24.470
I realized I spent too much
time silo'd up in my office.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.942
I need to be in the ebb and flow.

13:25.975 --> 13:28.181
Get my hands dirty, you know?

13:28.216 --> 13:29.845
I need to be more involved.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.085
All night, every night?

13:32.119 --> 13:33.429
I'll stay out of your way.

13:33.463 --> 13:34.422
I promise.

13:34.455 --> 13:36.469
I...

13:36.504 --> 13:37.589
How's it going?

13:41.079 --> 13:43.062
Okay. All right, all
the Jacks are in place.

13:43.095 --> 13:44.757
Okay, listen up. Nobody does a thing

13:44.791 --> 13:46.847
- until Dr. Alexander gives the signal, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.871 --> 13:48.511
You only look at and listen to her, got it?

13:48.535 --> 13:49.686
- All right.
- Yeah, okay.

13:49.719 --> 13:51.445
Okay, guys, on my count,

13:51.479 --> 13:54.134
one crank at a time, okay? Understood?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.776
- Tee, are you ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.397
Okay, good. On my count.

13:57.431 --> 14:00.053
1, 2, 3.

14:02.199 --> 14:03.445
Again.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.262
1, 2, 3.

14:08.503 --> 14:10.719
- He's bleeding out. We're losing him.
- His temperature's crashing.

14:10.743 --> 14:12.096
Lower the jack now!

14:12.120 --> 14:15.797
No! Daddy! Get it down! Now!

14:31.962 --> 14:34.777
It's crazy, but the elevator
is keeping him alive.

14:34.810 --> 14:36.482
Its weight is stopping him
from bleeding internally.

14:36.506 --> 14:39.192
He most definitely has severe
injuries to his heart and aorta.

14:39.227 --> 14:41.753
Exactly. So if we move him, he dies.

14:41.786 --> 14:44.536
But if he stays, he dies.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.647
- What he needs is E.C.M.O.
- We can't do that.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.097
E.C.M.O.'s never done
outside of a hospital.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.280
Just because it hasn't been done

14:49.304 --> 14:50.529
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be.

14:50.553 --> 14:52.407
Okay, look, if he has no blood in his body,

14:52.440 --> 14:54.273
then he cannot bleed out
when we move the elevator.

14:54.297 --> 14:56.535
We got at least 30 minutes
to get him to the O.R.,

14:56.569 --> 14:58.263
repair his injuries.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.777
I mean, E.C.M.O.'s his only chance, right?

14:59.801 --> 15:02.583
Even if we get approval,
and that is a huge...

15:02.617 --> 15:04.375
It's still better than if we don't try.

15:12.153 --> 15:13.153
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

15:13.177 --> 15:15.063
Make the call.

15:15.097 --> 15:17.142
Look at that. Heart rate's coming down.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.447
He's got color in his cheeks. Looking good.

15:19.481 --> 15:22.103
You got Ancef and Gent
for the open fracture?

15:22.137 --> 15:24.535
- Uh, yeah. That's right.
- Ah.

15:24.568 --> 15:26.038
<i>Mira...</i>

15:34.841 --> 15:36.791
- Excuse me. Topher?
- Yeah?

15:36.825 --> 15:38.144
It's Jordan calling from the scene.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.926
She needs to speak with you right away.

15:39.961 --> 15:41.111
- Thank you, Ken.
- Yeah.

15:41.144 --> 15:42.144
All right, later.

15:43.737 --> 15:46.615
What's up, Jordan?

15:46.648 --> 15:49.367
E.C.M.O.? In the field? Are you nuts?

15:49.401 --> 15:52.215
- Ragosa will never approve that.
- Just pass me through to Ragosa.

15:52.249 --> 15:54.582
Well, he's... he's right here.

15:54.617 --> 15:57.271
Hey, Michael, it's Jordan.

15:57.305 --> 15:58.583
What's going on?

15:58.617 --> 16:01.015
Okay, before you say
no, I need you to listen.

16:01.048 --> 16:03.895
Michael, you know that I
lost my father at a young age.

16:03.928 --> 16:06.102
Your kids almost lost you.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.919
Scott, would you mind
if I put on some music?

16:08.953 --> 16:10.967
I like it when I suture. I, uh,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.887
find it activate sensory pathways

16:12.920 --> 16:16.087
that compete with pain
pathways, reduces anxiety,

16:16.121 --> 16:19.383
- all sorts of good things.
- Ah, I'm not really a music guy in the O.R.

16:19.417 --> 16:22.377
- Some other time.
- All right, let's get this rebar out of here right now.

16:24.088 --> 16:26.614
And... It's...

16:26.649 --> 16:28.278
Out.

16:28.313 --> 16:29.591
Beautiful.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.775
No bleeding.

16:30.808 --> 16:32.855
Needle driver and 5.0 Vicryl to me, please.

16:32.888 --> 16:34.969
- Close her out...
- Dr. Clemens, sorry to interrupt.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.345
- Jordan needs to speak with you.
- I'm a little busy right now.

16:37.369 --> 16:38.689
They're taking an E.C.M.O.
unit out in the field

16:38.713 --> 16:39.958
and they need a surgeon.

16:39.993 --> 16:42.263
- What?
- Never heard of that before.

16:42.297 --> 16:44.288
- Ragosa approve this?
- It's already being loaded.

16:44.312 --> 16:45.729
Go ahead, Scott. I just gotta close.

16:45.753 --> 16:47.255
Krista can be my second set of hands.

16:47.288 --> 16:49.527
If they're going to do that,
you need to be out there.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.191
Son of a bitch.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.679
Jocelyn, could you please
page Dr. Bell-Hart for me?

16:54.712 --> 16:56.311
- Sure.
- And, uh, go ahead

16:56.345 --> 16:58.487
- and turn on the music, please?
- Thanks.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.262
No, you get two pills four
times a day, that's it.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.567
Rick, you can't take any
more. It's not good for you.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.825
I know... I'll see you in the morning.

17:13.848 --> 17:15.095
Sorry it's taking so long,

17:15.127 --> 17:16.319
but I swear you're gonna be next.

17:16.344 --> 17:17.569
Oh, I've waited for months to see a doc,

17:17.593 --> 17:18.869
so a couple hours is nothing.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.224
Plus I never had a doc get
me soda and chips before.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.391
Oh, hey. Where... where
you going with that?

17:22.425 --> 17:24.951
Oh, uh, Paul needed some
extra supplies for the vets.

17:24.983 --> 17:26.679
So... Yeah. Oh, nice, good.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.800
- Um, hey, I've been meaning to ask you a question.
- What's up?

17:28.824 --> 17:31.286
How long have you been
sleeping with Krista?

17:31.321 --> 17:33.110
What are you talking...

17:33.145 --> 17:34.912
- I'm not sleeping...
- Dude, I've been in the closet for 20 years.

17:34.936 --> 17:36.320
- What are you talking...
- I know when someone's keeping a secret.

17:36.344 --> 17:39.990
Plus, I saw you two at
the Riverwalk on Friday.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.271
Okay. Okay.

17:41.304 --> 17:42.561
But you can't tell anybody.

17:42.585 --> 17:44.630
- Just a hookup, or...
- You can't...

17:44.665 --> 17:46.721
well, it started off like
that, man, but I don't know.

17:46.745 --> 17:48.087
I mean, it feels like...

17:48.120 --> 17:51.031
feels like it's turning
into something else now, man.

17:54.361 --> 17:56.662
And you said
Paul sent you in here?

17:56.697 --> 17:58.678
Oh...

17:58.713 --> 18:00.727
That young'un's gonna pay.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.647
Paul better watch out.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.238
- Where are they?
- Let me deal with him. You'll just piss him off.

18:09.273 --> 18:12.247
What the hell are you doing?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.112
And what is T.C. doing here?
He's still under suspension.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.566
Okay, let's just focus
on this man, all right?

18:16.601 --> 18:19.319
Pressure is tamponading
severe mediastinal injuries.

18:19.352 --> 18:21.175
Yes. The E.C.M.O. is a hail Mary,

18:21.208 --> 18:23.863
but we have to try. We
can't just let him die here.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.729
I don't want him to die
here, but you just said it.

18:25.753 --> 18:28.503
It is a hail Mary, and if you
try it and it doesn't work,

18:28.536 --> 18:29.953
you're putting yourself and the hospital

18:29.977 --> 18:31.543
in the cross-hair for a lawsuit.

18:31.576 --> 18:32.960
Still doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.

18:32.984 --> 18:34.497
It's cardiac bypass in an elevator shaft!

18:34.521 --> 18:36.791
Hey, hold... hold, hold, hold, hold.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.935
Jordan, listen to me, okay?

18:38.969 --> 18:40.896
Because you didn't listen
to me last time with Milo,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.720
and he ended up dead, and
you were under investigation.

18:42.744 --> 18:44.001
No, this has nothing to do with Milo.

18:44.025 --> 18:45.440
No, it has everything to do with it.

18:45.464 --> 18:47.553
It has to do with your judgment,
and the bad decisions that...

18:47.577 --> 18:48.801
hey, hey, hey! What the hell is going on?

18:48.825 --> 18:50.529
Okay, look. You need... you need to listen.

18:50.553 --> 18:52.055
To you? Last time I saw you,

18:52.088 --> 18:53.761
you were having a nervous
breakdown in my O.R.

18:53.785 --> 18:55.447
It was so bad they had to suspend you,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.089
- so I don't even know what you're doing here right now.
- Scott...

18:57.113 --> 18:59.447
No, no, no. No. No. Go ahead, let it out.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.472
Say whatever you want, 'cause I
don't care what you think of me.

19:01.496 --> 19:03.265
Okay? But just 'cause
you're pissed off at Jordan

19:03.289 --> 19:04.481
'cause you got your feelings hurt,

19:04.505 --> 19:05.696
you're gonna let that man die?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.383
No, I'm not letting anyone die.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.921
- I am pointing out that if you move that guy...
- Point it out later!

19:09.945 --> 19:12.535
Okay, look. I hate saying this,

19:12.569 --> 19:14.518
but right now you are the only one

19:14.553 --> 19:15.799
who can save that man.

19:15.832 --> 19:18.231
They need you.

19:23.641 --> 19:26.231
Okay, but if we do this, we do it my way.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.969
You understand? You do
everything that I say,

19:27.993 --> 19:29.568
because that is his
only chance. You got it?

19:29.592 --> 19:31.606
Sure. Whatever you need.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.047
Everybody listen up.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.190
We're going to do a veno-arterial bypass.

19:35.225 --> 19:36.705
I don't have access to his heart or groin,

19:36.729 --> 19:38.017
so I'm going in through the neck.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.502
We need cooled saline and
bags of ice... lots of them.

19:40.536 --> 19:42.391
I need the venous and the arterial circuits

19:42.424 --> 19:43.703
flushed and ready to go.

19:43.736 --> 19:46.135
- Let's get started.
- Okay. Come on.

19:46.168 --> 19:47.703
All right, let's save this guy.

19:54.229 --> 19:56.885
It's working. We need to slow
down his brain metabolism.

19:56.918 --> 19:58.772
- More ice.
- Looks like that's it.

19:58.807 --> 19:59.807
Blood is drained.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.460
Core temp's holding at 16.5.

20:01.495 --> 20:02.815
We got 30 minutes to
get him through the O.R.

20:02.839 --> 20:04.117
Or tissue starts to die.

20:04.150 --> 20:05.919
- He's not gonna make it, is he?
- We don't know that.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.501
No, you're just saying
that to make me feel better.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.526
But he wouldn't have even
been here if it wasn't for me.

20:10.550 --> 20:12.757
I got this stupid speeding ticket, and...

20:12.790 --> 20:14.677
I can't lose my father.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.085
He's all that I have.

20:16.118 --> 20:18.709
Alicia, I promise you

20:18.742 --> 20:21.333
that we are going to do
everything that we can.

20:21.366 --> 20:24.340
Dr. Clemens is our top surgeon.

20:24.375 --> 20:28.436
So right now, I-I just
need you to be strong.

20:28.471 --> 20:32.597
That's what they said when my mom died.

20:32.630 --> 20:35.924
I'm so tired of being strong.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.644
All right, people,
got to move. Let's go!

20:40.022 --> 20:42.709
Okay, honey, we got to go now, all right?

20:46.838 --> 20:48.660
You were a captain? I was just a grunt.

20:48.694 --> 20:50.612
Nah, there's no such thing as a grunt.

20:50.647 --> 20:52.191
Give me your hands. Anyway, T.C. told me

20:52.215 --> 20:53.470
how kick-ass you were out in the field,

20:53.494 --> 20:54.879
so we're gonna give you
the A-plus treatment.

20:54.903 --> 20:56.372
Push. Pull.

20:56.407 --> 20:57.662
Now how long you been on the Vicodin?

20:57.686 --> 20:59.316
Months. It's the only thing that helps.

20:59.351 --> 21:01.973
Truth is, I need them to
block the pain so I can train.

21:02.006 --> 21:04.820
I want to re-enlist. I want
to learn to fly choppers.

21:04.855 --> 21:06.388
I want to kick some I.S.I.S. ass

21:06.423 --> 21:08.437
like that woman fighter
pilot from the U.A.E.

21:08.470 --> 21:10.943
- I like the sound of it.
- Yeah, but the pain keeps me from training.

21:10.967 --> 21:13.941
I won't pass the physical. I
can barely do three push-ups.

21:13.974 --> 21:15.415
Can you put your chin to your chest?

21:15.446 --> 21:17.492
- So I just need to pass the test...
- Head up.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.861
Save the money, and get a
chiropractor to fix my neck.

21:19.895 --> 21:21.525
All right.

21:21.558 --> 21:23.701
All right.

21:23.735 --> 21:26.196
Okay. Yep. Ma'am.

21:26.231 --> 21:27.391
Do you need some water, or...

21:31.063 --> 21:33.077
Uh, has this happened before?

21:33.110 --> 21:35.028
- A couple times.
- Okay. Relax.

21:35.063 --> 21:36.447
Paul, we're gonna need a chest C.T.

21:36.471 --> 21:38.580
- Remember, it's off-book.
- Okay.

21:38.614 --> 21:39.892
Uh...

21:39.926 --> 21:42.325
We'll get to the bottom of this.

21:42.358 --> 21:43.638
Let's get her to recovery.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.036
Check a neuro exam on arrival
then "Q" two hours overnight.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.871
So I take it that was your
first rebar in the neck, too?

21:47.895 --> 21:50.644
Yeah. Seen fence posts,
broken hockey sticks,

21:50.679 --> 21:52.853
swords, knives, R.P.G.

21:52.886 --> 21:54.996
Grenade? You were in the military?

21:55.031 --> 21:58.293
Yes, ma'am. Air Force
academy, class of 1999.

21:58.326 --> 22:00.660
No offense, but you
don't seem like that type.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.260
And what type is that?

22:02.295 --> 22:04.500
You're just more of a yoga-quoting,

22:04.534 --> 22:06.772
Enya-listening, meditating type.

22:06.806 --> 22:08.180
Did you see any action?

22:08.215 --> 22:09.968
Yeah. A couple of tours in Iraq.

22:10.091 --> 22:12.040
Yeah, Drew was in Iraq, too, as a medic.

22:12.074 --> 22:14.824
I think half our shift
served in the military.

22:14.858 --> 22:16.520
So, I mean, were you just stationed here

22:16.555 --> 22:18.322
and you decided to stay
like most everyone else?

22:18.346 --> 22:19.816
No, I'm a local boy.

22:19.851 --> 22:22.217
Just came back from Florida
to take care of my parents.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.745
God, that is sweet. You
must really love them.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.472
Not really.

22:26.507 --> 22:28.242
- Everybody move! Let's make some room!
- We have to start the rewarming

22:28.266 --> 22:29.682
- right away, or his brain will die!
- You have to stay out of it now!

22:29.706 --> 22:31.218
We're back in the hospital. Tell the O.R.

22:31.242 --> 22:32.851
We're cracking his chest
the second we get up there!

22:32.875 --> 22:34.706
Make sure they know I'm
doing a median sternotomy.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.384
- I got it!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go. Steady.

22:37.419 --> 22:39.401
Have Dr. Chavez meet me there.

22:45.226 --> 22:47.689
Gotta say, when I first saw the elevator

22:47.722 --> 22:50.440
on this guy's chest, I didn't
expect him to make it this far.

22:50.474 --> 22:52.425
Yeah. That was a good call by Jordan.

22:52.458 --> 22:56.681
Ballsy. This guy had no other option.

22:56.714 --> 23:01.481
So, dual rebar operation and an E.C.M.O.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.337
That's a hell of a first night for you.

23:03.370 --> 23:05.032
Piece of cake compared to my first night

23:05.067 --> 23:06.664
in Al-Anbar province.

23:06.698 --> 23:09.001
Suicide bomber walked into a market.

23:09.034 --> 23:11.112
We heard the blast from 5 miles out.

23:11.146 --> 23:14.249
Just... Never seen so many body parts.

23:14.282 --> 23:16.808
Just everywhere. Stuck to the walls.

23:16.843 --> 23:18.409
Sorry, man. I had no idea.

23:18.442 --> 23:21.000
No, don't be sorry. I
mean, how could you know?

23:21.035 --> 23:23.464
I hadn't thought about that in years.

23:23.498 --> 23:25.864
So, no music in the O.R.

23:25.898 --> 23:28.680
I find it too much of a distraction.

23:28.715 --> 23:31.208
That's cool.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.857
Just messin' with you.

23:41.674 --> 23:45.320
Oh, Tricia. Just a few
more minutes, darling.

23:45.354 --> 23:47.272
Hang in there, okay?

23:47.307 --> 23:49.096
<i>Oh. That's not good.</i>

23:49.131 --> 23:51.784
Hey. I just got word Tricia needed a scan.

23:51.818 --> 23:53.257
What's going on?

23:54.602 --> 23:56.968
Son of a bitch.

23:57.003 --> 24:00.137
- A tumor?
- It's a stage 2 pancoast tumor at the top of

24:00.170 --> 24:02.440
your lung. That's what's
been causing your neck pain,

24:02.474 --> 24:05.000
- not a pulled muscle.
- No way. I don't smoke.

24:05.034 --> 24:06.098
I swear, I've never smoked.

24:06.122 --> 24:08.521
If someone's smoking, I walk away.

24:08.554 --> 24:10.120
I saw one of your duties in Afghanistan

24:10.154 --> 24:12.488
was working in the trash pits.

24:12.523 --> 24:15.080
You were exposed to all sorts of chemicals

24:15.114 --> 24:18.729
- for hours every day.
- They said it was safe.

24:18.762 --> 24:20.840
- I'm sorry.
- What do I do?

24:20.874 --> 24:22.569
<i>We get it out of there.</i>

24:22.602 --> 24:24.520
Don't B.S. me, T.C.

24:24.554 --> 24:26.569
You know I'm a straight shooter.

24:26.602 --> 24:28.329
So am I.

24:28.362 --> 24:30.601
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

24:30.634 --> 24:32.104
Promise.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.848
I shouldn't have to take 15 phone calls

24:35.882 --> 24:37.160
in the middle of the night

24:37.194 --> 24:38.482
because you approve an
E.C.M.O. in the field!

24:38.506 --> 24:41.128
- Wait. It needed to be done.
- I don't even know what to say.

24:41.162 --> 24:43.752
Do you have any idea how much that costs?

24:43.786 --> 24:45.513
Yes.

24:45.546 --> 24:46.921
And yet you did it anyway!

24:46.954 --> 24:48.552
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:48.586 --> 24:50.761
Why the hell would you do that?

24:50.794 --> 24:52.648
I'm waiting.

24:52.682 --> 24:55.752
I did it because, um...

24:55.786 --> 24:58.664
I wanted to do...

24:58.699 --> 25:01.000
One decent thing on this job

25:01.034 --> 25:02.312
before I quit.

25:02.346 --> 25:05.192
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.

25:05.226 --> 25:07.432
I quit.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.609
I don't want to do this job anymore.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.904
I had a piece of my brain removed

25:12.938 --> 25:15.400
to get to my tumor.

25:15.434 --> 25:17.704
Most people can barely recite
the alphabet after that,

25:17.738 --> 25:21.256
but I have all of my faculties,
and I refuse to push paper

25:21.291 --> 25:23.528
at a place where everybody hates me!

25:24.906 --> 25:28.457
Ahh! God, this feels so good.

25:30.058 --> 25:32.744
You have no idea how good it feels

25:32.778 --> 25:35.656
to finally do what you want to do.

25:35.691 --> 25:37.224
So, yes.

25:37.258 --> 25:38.952
Yes. I quit.

25:38.986 --> 25:40.520
And I could not be happier.

25:40.554 --> 25:43.817
- Have your desk cleaned out by morning.
- I already started.

25:45.258 --> 25:47.368
Ragosa's quitting.

25:47.402 --> 25:49.512
Oh, that's crazy.

26:13.134 --> 26:15.373
Hey, you.

26:15.406 --> 26:17.709
The nurses said that I would find you here.

26:17.743 --> 26:21.037
My dad always hated this stuff.

26:21.070 --> 26:24.333
But he never said anything.

26:24.367 --> 26:27.277
He just let me be me.

26:27.311 --> 26:29.741
Well, I have some good news.

26:29.775 --> 26:31.181
I just spoke with the O.R.,

26:31.215 --> 26:33.709
and so far your dad's holding up.

26:33.743 --> 26:35.949
Thank you.

26:35.983 --> 26:38.477
I called my aunt from
Dallas. She's coming down.

26:38.511 --> 26:40.877
- Good. That's good.
- Yeah.

26:42.159 --> 26:45.197
Alicia, I want to apologize to you

26:45.231 --> 26:47.084
for what I said earlier.

26:47.119 --> 26:49.037
About being strong.

26:49.071 --> 26:51.565
- Oh, I...
- No, I don't even know why I said that to you,

26:51.599 --> 26:54.189
because I always hated it
when adults said that to me.

26:54.223 --> 26:58.829
No, I never understood
why I had to be strong,

26:58.862 --> 27:00.813
why I couldn't cry,

27:00.847 --> 27:03.565
why I couldn't have feelings.

27:03.599 --> 27:06.189
Feelings are good, Alicia.

27:06.223 --> 27:08.749
Don't ever let anyone tell you how to feel.

27:08.783 --> 27:10.925
I don't know how I feel.

27:13.262 --> 27:16.397
I'm just numb.

27:16.431 --> 27:20.845
Well, uh, do you mind if I...

27:20.879 --> 27:24.141
Stay with you until your aunt gets here?

27:24.174 --> 27:27.117
You know, maybe we could be numb together.

27:29.486 --> 27:32.621
Or cry. I'm...
I'm cool with whatever.

27:32.655 --> 27:35.245
Uh...

27:41.358 --> 27:43.309
It's gonna be all right.

27:46.095 --> 27:47.533
Okay.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.549
So she can't get into the V.A. for months

27:49.583 --> 27:50.956
because of the backlog.

27:50.991 --> 27:53.133
At which time her cancer
will be stage 3 or 4,

27:53.167 --> 27:54.701
too late for her survive.

27:54.735 --> 27:57.453
Pentagon buys $200 million
planes that nobody wants,

27:57.487 --> 27:59.222
- but a soldier can't get a doctor.
- Yeah, I hear that.

27:59.246 --> 28:01.773
And she has no insurance and no savings,

28:01.807 --> 28:03.853
so she can't get a surgeon to do it.

28:03.886 --> 28:06.093
Why don't we just check her
in here like everybody else?

28:06.127 --> 28:08.332
I mean, get her tests done
on-book and just do it here.

28:08.367 --> 28:10.093
We have a great thoracic surgeon on staff.

28:10.127 --> 28:11.767
Yeah, and we have to
treat everybody who comes

28:11.791 --> 28:12.918
through those doors. Surgeons don't.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.092
They just treat emergencies.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.397
<i>- This is an emergency.
- Not technically.</i>

28:16.431 --> 28:18.381
I mean, it... it will become one.

28:18.415 --> 28:20.141
Okay, let's at least do what Paul says.

28:20.175 --> 28:23.789
Let's check her in. Get
it... get it started.

28:23.823 --> 28:26.476
Let's present the case to the surgeon.

28:26.511 --> 28:29.004
Who knows? Maybe he'll do it.

28:30.766 --> 28:32.141
Are you planning your escape?

28:32.175 --> 28:34.317
Ha. Yeah,

28:34.351 --> 28:35.446
Topher thought it was better

28:35.470 --> 28:36.727
if I wasn't hanging
out inside the hospital.

28:36.751 --> 28:37.911
Suspension and all.

28:37.935 --> 28:40.620
- Ah, yeah. That little thing.
- Mm-hmm.

28:40.655 --> 28:42.989
It's a weird shift, huh?

28:43.023 --> 28:46.093
You know, E.C.M.O. and
the motorcycle accident.

28:46.126 --> 28:48.300
That is why I never let you on my bike.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.957
Well, it was a pretty amazing
thing to witness, you know?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.581
I mean, this guy has a piece
of rebar through his brain,

28:53.614 --> 28:55.949
and the only thing he can
think about is his wife.

28:55.982 --> 28:58.829
Well, guess if you find the right woman,

28:58.862 --> 29:00.941
you'll do anything for her.

29:03.983 --> 29:07.533
Topher wants me back
inside. It's about Tricia.

29:07.567 --> 29:09.741
Yeah, I heard about that.

29:09.774 --> 29:11.852
I'm sorry, T, that's... that's really sad.

29:11.887 --> 29:14.445
You know, I never... Told
you how great she was for me.

29:14.478 --> 29:16.557
I didn't wanna burden you with my therapy.

29:16.591 --> 29:18.316
You're not a burden.

29:18.351 --> 29:20.461
Yeah, just... I need to
get there myself, you know?

29:20.494 --> 29:22.252
But, uh, she's a real ball buster for me.

29:22.287 --> 29:23.917
She was the first one to call me out.

29:23.951 --> 29:24.877
Oh, yeah?

29:24.911 --> 29:26.189
- Yeah.
- How?

29:26.223 --> 29:27.853
Well, she was like,

29:27.887 --> 29:29.580
"your brother got himself killed,"

29:29.615 --> 29:31.725
and that Thad dying
was his fault, not mine,

29:31.758 --> 29:34.093
but... That he was reckless
and he had no business

29:34.126 --> 29:36.749
sending a doc in there first...
that was an N.C.O.'s job...

29:36.783 --> 29:38.989
and that he put the entire platoon at risk

29:39.023 --> 29:41.804
by putting the medical
officer in jeopardy.

29:41.839 --> 29:44.045
- Wow.
- The entire group completely agreed with her.

29:44.079 --> 29:46.093
But did you agree with her?

29:46.127 --> 29:48.237
You know, if it wasn't me,

29:48.271 --> 29:49.996
I probably would have, but, uh...

29:50.031 --> 29:52.237
You know, it's hard to look at it that way.

29:52.270 --> 29:54.381
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, T.

29:54.415 --> 29:56.141
- Yeah. And...
- And you've changed.

29:56.175 --> 29:57.324
I've seen it.

29:57.359 --> 29:59.340
When I had my breakdown...

29:59.375 --> 30:00.397
breakthrough.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.028
Yeah. Uh...

30:02.063 --> 30:03.095
You know, you said you would always

30:03.119 --> 30:05.325
be there for me, and... and you have.

30:05.358 --> 30:08.140
I just wanted to say that
that meant a lot to me.

30:10.254 --> 30:11.533
Gotta...

30:11.566 --> 30:13.996
- Guess we should go back inside.
- Yeah.

30:14.031 --> 30:16.589
Don't make any plans for
two weeks from Friday.

30:16.622 --> 30:18.573
Why?

30:18.606 --> 30:19.606
Tee, why?

30:21.326 --> 30:22.349
Hey, I spoke

30:22.382 --> 30:23.670
to the thoracic surgeon about Tricia.

30:23.694 --> 30:24.908
It's a no-go.

30:24.943 --> 30:26.572
He can't do one pro Bono surgery?

30:26.607 --> 30:28.556
Actually, he does several each month.

30:28.591 --> 30:29.933
He can only do so many.

30:29.966 --> 30:31.853
He did say he'd cut his fee in half,

30:31.886 --> 30:33.997
so all we need is 15 grand. You got that?

30:34.031 --> 30:35.212
What do you think?

30:35.247 --> 30:36.653
That was a rhetorical question.

30:36.686 --> 30:39.212
I'd be surprised if you had 15 bucks.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.253
- I'm sorry, brother.
- Yeah.

30:47.375 --> 30:48.941
Excuse me, ma'am?

30:48.974 --> 30:50.710
We thought you might wanna
share the room with your husband?

30:50.734 --> 30:52.973
He should just be coming, too.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.949
Don't even try.

30:55.982 --> 30:57.559
Talk about beating the odds.

30:57.583 --> 30:59.446
Ma'am, we needed to sedate
your husband to pull the last

30:59.470 --> 31:00.557
of the rebar out.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.669
It had shifted, and the
pain was just too intense.

31:02.702 --> 31:04.909
Mr. Woo, can you hear us?

31:04.942 --> 31:06.861
Remember me? I'm Dr. Zia.

31:06.894 --> 31:10.221
I worked on you when you came in. Mr. Woo?

31:10.255 --> 31:14.828
You're here with your wife.
She's right next to you, sir.

31:14.863 --> 31:17.069
Mr. Woo? Do you wanna
say anything to your wife?

31:26.766 --> 31:29.388
Mr. Woo? I need you to
speak to me in English.

31:30.862 --> 31:31.885
I don't think he can.

31:42.262 --> 31:44.660
She says her husband grew
up in a bilingual family.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.036
That explains it.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.636
I was able to preserve his speech,

31:47.671 --> 31:49.300
but the rebar must have injured

31:49.335 --> 31:51.413
the English language centers of his brain.

31:51.446 --> 31:53.086
He's gonna have to completely relearn it.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.356
Well, considering that

31:54.391 --> 31:55.518
a pole went through his
brain at 70 miles per hour,

31:55.542 --> 31:56.991
I think things can be
a hell of a lot worse.

31:57.015 --> 32:00.020
Okay. Here we go. I downloaded
a Mandarin-to-English app,

32:00.055 --> 32:02.836
and I figured... that way you could talk,

32:02.870 --> 32:04.927
- and we could explain.
- That's a great idea, Krista.

32:04.951 --> 32:07.060
Mandarin-to-English.
Who knew?

32:07.094 --> 32:10.709
I'm gonna send the Cantonese
version to my parents.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.220
I'm in shock. I don't understand.

32:19.255 --> 32:21.108
I thought you said the surgeon couldn't.

32:21.142 --> 32:22.815
I know, but he got an
opening in his schedule.

32:22.839 --> 32:25.269
There's a certain amount
of pro Bono cases per month,

32:25.302 --> 32:27.572
and one fell through, and
it's just lucky timing.

32:27.606 --> 32:28.660
Oh, my God!

32:28.694 --> 32:30.452
You were up next.

32:30.486 --> 32:32.852
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Thank you.

32:34.103 --> 32:36.340
Huh? Oh.

32:36.374 --> 32:37.428
- Did you hear?
- What?

32:37.462 --> 32:39.380
The surgeon agreed to
do it. I'm gonna live.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.884
I'm gonna live!

32:49.750 --> 32:51.381
Core temp's back up to 98 degrees.

32:51.414 --> 32:52.532
So far, so good.

32:52.566 --> 32:54.206
How's it going? How's our E.C.M.O. patient?

32:54.230 --> 32:55.956
You're just in time
for the moment of truth.

32:55.991 --> 32:57.012
Let's come off bypass.

32:57.047 --> 32:58.388
Coming off bypass.

33:01.302 --> 33:02.612
It's not beating.

33:02.646 --> 33:04.286
It just needs to wake
up. Give me the paddles.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.549
Clear.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.198
Come on, come on.
Increase the joules to 20.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.372
Clear.

33:15.414 --> 33:18.613
Okay, sats are rising.

33:18.646 --> 33:21.460
Come on, take it to the rack, baby.

33:22.902 --> 33:24.789
All right. You did it, Scott.

33:24.822 --> 33:26.292
That was amazing. Really amazing.

33:26.326 --> 33:28.948
Okay, I'm gonna disconnect the tube.

33:28.983 --> 33:30.228
Scott?

33:30.262 --> 33:34.516
I'm really sorry about how
things turned out between us.

33:34.550 --> 33:38.612
Yeah. Well, you got what you wanted.

33:38.646 --> 33:41.557
Okay, let's close.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.692
Hey, Drew, honey, come here.

33:48.726 --> 33:50.356
Will you help me with this, please?

33:50.390 --> 33:52.532
I gotta get it straight,
and I can't get it up.

33:52.566 --> 33:53.716
Just, will you hold that?

33:53.750 --> 33:54.836
Yeah, yeah.

33:54.870 --> 33:57.332
Just put it up a little bit higher.

33:57.366 --> 33:58.367
Right there. That's... you know what?

33:58.391 --> 34:00.276
That's perfect right there.

34:00.311 --> 34:02.868
- You need to...
- That's perfect.

34:02.902 --> 34:04.372
Okay, come on, come on.

34:04.406 --> 34:06.132
Finally got you.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.382
Sucker.
Huh? Where you at?

34:08.406 --> 34:09.406
Dr. Chavez, come here.
You've got to see this.

34:09.429 --> 34:10.750
What the hell, guys?

34:10.774 --> 34:12.212
Excuse me? Ken?

34:12.246 --> 34:14.549
Let me help you breathe here.

34:14.581 --> 34:17.333
That's amazing. That is amazing.

34:17.366 --> 34:19.253
We're just one big happy
family, right, Drew?

34:19.286 --> 34:20.532
Yeah, I can see that.

34:20.565 --> 34:22.931
I think I'm gonna like working
here. You guys are crazy.

34:22.966 --> 34:25.556
- Welcome to the night shift, Dr. Chavez.
- Don't touch me.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.188
He said, "don't touch me."

34:27.222 --> 34:28.462
- Are you serious?
- Sandwiches.

34:37.525 --> 34:38.900
Uh, you... you okay?

34:38.934 --> 34:44.179
No, I am not okay. I made
a huge, massive mistake.

34:44.214 --> 34:48.116
You see these... these big speeches

34:48.150 --> 34:50.708
in the movies, and it looks cool,

34:50.742 --> 34:54.004
and the guy gets the girl and the job,

34:54.038 --> 34:55.764
and the music plays?

34:55.797 --> 34:59.573
Well... That ain't
happening. There is no music.

34:59.606 --> 35:03.732
I am so, so screwed! What
the hell was I thinking?

35:03.766 --> 35:06.932
Clearly, you had some
things to get off your chest.

35:07.052 --> 35:09.162
I-I-I couldn't have waited, huh?

35:09.197 --> 35:12.139
He was... he was 30
seconds away from firing me.

35:12.172 --> 35:14.634
I would have had a-a severance package,

35:14.669 --> 35:16.427
I would have had C.O.B.R.A. insurance.

35:16.460 --> 35:19.882
Do you have any idea
how much insurance costs

35:19.917 --> 35:21.194
for a year for a family?

35:21.229 --> 35:22.731
Absolutely. About 20 grand.

35:22.764 --> 35:24.938
You know we don't get insurance here.

35:24.973 --> 35:27.243
So what are you gonna do?

35:27.276 --> 35:29.322
Actually, I'm gonna...

35:32.141 --> 35:35.819
I've been studying to take the boards

35:35.852 --> 35:37.482
and get my M.D.

35:37.516 --> 35:40.810
That is why you knew how
to treat the open fracture.

35:40.844 --> 35:43.018
I was gonna say...

35:43.091 --> 35:45.297
Well, good for you. You
know, I was in residency

35:45.330 --> 35:48.208
with a 50-year-old lawyer
who changed careers.

35:48.243 --> 35:49.520
It's never too late.

35:49.555 --> 35:52.656
You know one thing I
learned from almost dying?

35:52.691 --> 35:55.153
You have to live in the moment.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.681
<i>That is the best that we can do.</i>

35:57.714 --> 36:00.881
I hope I didn't make
a huge mistake tonight.

36:00.915 --> 36:04.145
Because right now it
really feels like I did.

36:04.178 --> 36:06.897
Hmm. You got a second?

36:06.931 --> 36:09.777
I wanna show you something.

36:09.811 --> 36:11.889
Come on.

36:15.059 --> 36:16.977
See what's going on in that room?

36:17.010 --> 36:18.224
That's because of you.

36:18.259 --> 36:21.137
That girl has her father back

36:21.171 --> 36:23.569
because of you.

36:23.603 --> 36:26.993
Doesn't feel like a huge mistake to me.

36:27.026 --> 36:29.073
Thanks, Topher.

36:32.434 --> 36:34.929
Y-you know, um...

36:34.963 --> 36:38.577
It's about an 80% pay cut,
uh, but we have an opening

36:38.611 --> 36:40.497
for a physician's assistant.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.736
Now you know what it is.

36:42.771 --> 36:44.817
It's a lot of scut work, lot of paperwork,

36:44.850 --> 36:45.905
lot of... ego humbling,

36:45.939 --> 36:47.921
but if you really wanna pass your boards

36:47.955 --> 36:50.225
and be a doctor, there's
no better way to learn.

36:50.258 --> 36:52.753
A physician's assistant?

36:52.786 --> 36:57.297
Yeah, and with your med
school, you more than qualify.

36:57.330 --> 37:00.305
So... just... just think about it,

37:00.339 --> 37:03.344
and if you hate it, you can always quit.

37:03.379 --> 37:04.625
Right?

37:04.658 --> 37:06.928
God knows you already got the speech down.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.977
I can't believe you guys saved him.

37:17.011 --> 37:18.321
I talked to the surgeon.

37:18.354 --> 37:20.401
He said you gave him the $15k to pay

37:20.434 --> 37:22.129
for Tricia's operation.

37:22.163 --> 37:23.281
Oh, yeah?

37:23.314 --> 37:27.281
And then Kenny said he
saw your bookie riding off

37:27.315 --> 37:29.360
on your old Harley.

37:29.395 --> 37:31.088
Selling Thad's old bike.

37:31.123 --> 37:34.897
That was an
unbelievably amazing thing

37:34.930 --> 37:36.465
you did for her, T.

37:38.162 --> 37:41.584
Of course, now if you
wanna pay me back the $800

37:41.619 --> 37:44.016
that you owe me...

37:44.051 --> 37:45.713
Yeah.

37:45.746 --> 37:47.408
I don't know, man.

37:47.443 --> 37:51.025
I learned I need to let some of Thad go.

37:51.059 --> 37:53.617
You know? Figure out what's me

37:53.651 --> 37:55.986
and what's me trying to be like him.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.010
You know?

37:57.034 --> 37:58.504
Yeah. I do know.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.264
I thought maybe this could help both of us

38:00.298 --> 38:02.505
move on from a bad hand.

38:02.538 --> 38:06.184
I hope it does. I love you, brother.

38:06.218 --> 38:09.160
I love you, too.

38:09.194 --> 38:11.090
But you are never getting
that $800 back.

38:11.114 --> 38:13.832
Why... why does that not surprise me?

38:13.866 --> 38:17.224
Hey, Topher. T.C.? Hey,
you guys need to see this.

38:17.259 --> 38:18.536
Hey.

38:18.570 --> 38:19.688
<i>Gracias, T.C.</i>

38:19.722 --> 38:21.128
<i>De nada.</i>

38:21.162 --> 38:22.472
What's going on?

38:22.506 --> 38:25.641
Gwen uploaded a video of you
and Jordan from back in the day.

38:25.674 --> 38:27.624
Halloween at our apartment, 2007. Remember?

38:27.658 --> 38:30.024
Oh. Oh, God.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.168
I just found my new screen saver.

38:32.202 --> 38:34.793
- Nice legs, Hermione. Nice legs.
- Oh, okay, okay.

38:34.826 --> 38:37.065
Not Hermione. Her-man-ee. You know?

38:37.098 --> 38:40.104
And Jordan is Harry Paw-ter.
Like the paws on the tie.

38:40.138 --> 38:42.408
The costume shop was
very specific about that.

38:42.442 --> 38:45.128
I think he looks
younger than I do, maybe.

38:45.162 --> 38:46.418
All right, one more time from the top.

38:46.442 --> 38:47.881
No. All right, revenge is swift.

38:47.914 --> 38:49.523
How in the hell did
T.C. score those tickets?

38:49.547 --> 38:51.368
What tickets? What are you talking about?

38:51.402 --> 38:53.074
The Spice Girls, front
row, two weeks from Friday,

38:53.098 --> 38:54.152
you and me?

38:54.186 --> 38:56.904
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

38:56.938 --> 38:59.912
Unbelievable.

39:03.146 --> 39:04.466
So how did you score those tickets?

39:04.490 --> 39:06.504
They were sold out months ago.

39:06.538 --> 39:10.024
Yeah? I got 'em months
ago. I knew you liked them.

39:34.666 --> 39:36.360
What are you doing?

39:41.962 --> 39:43.688
I thought you wanted to take it slow.

39:43.722 --> 39:45.577
I lied.
