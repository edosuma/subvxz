[Rachel]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:22.059 --> 00:23.059
I lied.

00:23.059 --> 00:24.161
<i>I told you that Jericho
was dead</i>

00:24.161 --> 00:25.396
<i>when I got to the church.</i>

00:25.429 --> 00:28.132
<i>He died trying to save me
from his father.</i>

00:28.166 --> 00:29.300
You lying sack of shit!

00:29.333 --> 00:31.035
-I'm out.
-I'm out, too.

00:31.068 --> 00:33.737
He got a kid killed.
Who the fuck hides that?

00:33.771 --> 00:35.006
You were there, too.

00:35.039 --> 00:39.476
You played your part.

00:39.511 --> 00:41.445
[grunts]
Rachel, what's happening?

00:41.478 --> 00:43.113
[Rachel] <i>Sorry, Donna.</i>

00:43.146 --> 00:47.118
Conner, no!

00:47.151 --> 00:50.822
[cop grunts]

00:50.856 --> 00:52.890
[Mercy]
<i>We got a potential murderer
walking around out there,</i>

00:52.923 --> 00:55.158
with our technological
fingerprints all over him.

00:55.192 --> 00:56.527
We gotta bring
Subject 13 in.

00:56.561 --> 00:58.463
-We'll need your team.
-My pleasure.

00:58.496 --> 01:02.432
I help people that others
have given up on.

01:02.466 --> 01:04.203
-He cured me.
-From what?

01:04.236 --> 01:09.236
A rare disease, although
the cure I administered
had unforeseen side effects.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.109
[screaming]

01:13.144 --> 01:14.444
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:14.478 --> 01:16.914
I took advantage of Jericho
to get to your husband.

01:16.947 --> 01:18.882
I've got nothing
but pain for you.

01:18.915 --> 01:20.683
-Grayson!
-You killed him.

01:20.718 --> 01:22.186
This isn't about me.

01:22.219 --> 01:24.489
You still haven't accepted
your guilt.

01:24.522 --> 01:28.125
[Slade] <i>I sentence you
to live alone, Dick Grayson.</i>

01:28.159 --> 01:30.594
<i>Forever knowing
that your Titans family</i>

<i>lives and breathes
somewhere out there
in the world,</i>

01:33.864 --> 01:35.599
but you can never be with them.

01:35.632 --> 01:37.801
<i>Not until you've paid
for your crime.</i>

01:37.834 --> 01:39.736
Excuse me, sir.

01:39.737 --> 01:40.504
[grunts]

01:40.504 --> 01:42.140
[cop 1 grunts] Down...

01:42.174 --> 01:44.474
-[cop 3] Get on the ground!
-[cop 4]
On the ground, now!

01:44.474 --> 01:45.543
[cop 3] Show me your hands.

01:45.543 --> 01:46.810
[cop 4]
Hands behind your head.

01:46.843 --> 01:50.293
[cops continue yelling]

01:56.186 --> 01:59.790
[guard] Turn to your left.

01:59.822 --> 02:02.373
Now to the right.

02:09.866 --> 02:12.116
[scanner beeps]

03:39.189 --> 03:44.139
[pop music playing
on car stereo]

03:48.032 --> 03:52.770
We should play
more board games
as a family.

03:52.804 --> 03:55.406
It's supposed to
promote bonding
and connection.

03:55.439 --> 03:57.389
And it's fun.

04:01.679 --> 04:03.247
There's one
I read about online,

04:03.281 --> 04:06.050
something about a penguin
eating a fish.

04:06.082 --> 04:07.350
I hate fish.

04:07.384 --> 04:09.520
Well, you don't
have to eat it.
It's a game.

04:09.554 --> 04:10.854
It's make-believe.

04:10.889 --> 04:15.889
Can we play a vegan
make-believe game?

04:16.026 --> 04:19.862
I could use
a little help.

04:19.896 --> 04:24.235
They don't like fish.

04:24.269 --> 04:28.372
Well,
I don't like monogamy,
but I'm here, aren't I?

04:28.406 --> 04:31.375
We're playing
a board game, tonight.

04:31.408 --> 04:33.110
No dietary exemptions allowed.

Walter.

04:37.615 --> 04:39.050
You're talking to everyone.

04:39.084 --> 04:42.252
Hi, everyone.
There's been a development.

04:42.286 --> 04:44.254
Subject 13's popped back
in our radar.

04:44.288 --> 04:46.490
He's in the city.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.125
Thought you would like to know.

04:48.158 --> 04:49.661
Put a team together.

04:49.694 --> 04:51.461
I was thinking
you would say that.

04:51.461 --> 04:52.463
<i>Say goodbye now.</i>

04:52.497 --> 04:55.600
-[cell phone beeps]
-Goodbye--

05:36.072 --> 05:37.074
[Conner] Look, buddy.

05:37.108 --> 05:40.043
It's not safe for you
to be around me anymore.

05:40.076 --> 05:43.079
[barks]

05:43.112 --> 05:45.516
No, it's true.

05:45.550 --> 05:47.485
Okay, sooner or later,
they're gonna find me.

05:47.517 --> 05:49.452
You shouldn't be around
when that happens.

05:49.487 --> 05:50.620
You might get hurt.

05:50.654 --> 05:54.725
[Krypto whimpers]

05:54.759 --> 05:58.228
You didn't do anything wrong.

05:58.262 --> 06:00.463
Okay?

06:00.497 --> 06:02.567
I did.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.850
[barks, whines]

06:09.574 --> 06:13.343
Go on, Krypto.
Get out of here.

06:13.377 --> 06:16.747
[Krypto whining softly]

06:16.781 --> 06:19.815
I said get the hell
out of here,
you stupid mutt!

06:19.850 --> 06:21.185
Go!

06:21.218 --> 06:24.067
[Krypto whimpering]

06:34.163 --> 06:37.201
[guard] One call each.

06:37.233 --> 06:40.237
Two minutes max.

06:40.271 --> 06:43.307
Use it or lose it.

[inmates talking indistinctly]

06:55.019 --> 06:57.869
[keyboard clacking]

07:16.040 --> 07:18.976
Detective, huh?
I applied to the PD.

07:19.009 --> 07:21.312
Got red-flagged
on the MMPI.

07:21.312 --> 07:23.348
"I sometimes think of things
too horrible to speak of"?

07:23.348 --> 07:26.684
Uh, that's a fucking
affirmative, Madam
Test Administrator.

07:26.718 --> 07:28.487
Then spent four years
at Lyon County

07:28.519 --> 07:32.824
until the bastards
finally realized they were
wasting my potential.

07:32.857 --> 07:36.127
Welcome to Len Armstrong's
list of personal grievances.

07:36.161 --> 07:38.396
I bet you got your own
with that cop-hating PD

07:38.428 --> 07:40.297
who railroaded you
into a guilty plea.

07:40.331 --> 07:42.165
Bullshit, if you ask me.

07:42.199 --> 07:43.701
I wanted to plead guilty.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.603
[scoffs] Sure.

07:45.636 --> 07:48.204
Squeeze it down to 20 years
instead of 30.

07:48.238 --> 07:50.774
Got what I deserve.

07:50.807 --> 07:52.877
Goddamn prosecutors.

07:52.911 --> 07:56.213
Always hit you
when you're down.

07:56.247 --> 08:01.247
Don't worry. We take care
of our own here.

08:01.351 --> 08:05.088
Welcome to the west wing.

08:05.122 --> 08:06.490
No rose garden out back,

08:06.524 --> 08:07.992
but you got your privacy.

08:08.026 --> 08:12.596
Keep you tucked away
from the crazy.

08:12.629 --> 08:14.766
Rent's free.

08:14.766 --> 08:16.766
Just give me a heads-up
on shit before it hits the fan.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.269
Eyes and ears out
in the yard.

08:18.302 --> 08:20.336
You know the dealio.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.608
Yeah. Not for me.

08:23.641 --> 08:25.310
You'll wanna rethink that.

08:25.343 --> 08:29.012
Gen pop's no place
for a guy who wore a badge.

08:29.047 --> 08:34.047
Sorry. I'm out
of the business
of helping people.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.253
Okay.

08:36.287 --> 08:37.321
[scoffing]

08:37.354 --> 08:41.725
Okay.

08:41.759 --> 08:43.628
Detour time.

08:43.660 --> 08:47.465
[chuckles]

08:47.498 --> 08:49.634
[Len clears throat]

08:49.667 --> 08:52.970
Brought you someone new
to play with.

08:53.003 --> 08:55.105
Enjoy...

<i>I can't take your call
right now.</i>

09:58.870 --> 10:00.303
<i>Leave a message.</i>

10:00.336 --> 10:03.340
Dick, it's me again.

10:03.374 --> 10:04.808
[stammers] I know

10:04.841 --> 10:08.279
I screwed things up
really bad, man, but...

10:08.279 --> 10:10.313
And I get why maybe you don't
want to talk to me.

10:10.346 --> 10:14.684
But please, call me back.

[Krypto barks]

10:32.403 --> 10:33.452
Krypto.

10:39.076 --> 10:42.879
Hey, Dick. I know we're not
exactly on chatty terms,

10:42.913 --> 10:44.316
but Rachel went AWOL

10:44.349 --> 10:47.618
before our flight to Chicago.
So...

10:47.652 --> 10:49.187
I'm still in the city.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.288
I figure she'll turn up
when she runs out of cash,

10:51.322 --> 10:56.322
but... I'm really
starting to get worried.

10:56.894 --> 11:00.494
Just call me back, okay?

11:03.333 --> 11:05.169
Fuck!

11:05.202 --> 11:09.552
[employee] Here you go, dear.

11:10.942 --> 11:12.677
There you go.

-You're welcome.

Do you think
these are organic?

12:07.664 --> 12:11.936

12:11.969 --> 12:16.318
We've gotta die of something.

[indistinct conversations]

12:43.667 --> 12:45.436
Ow!

12:45.469 --> 12:48.139
It's my dead pile.

12:48.172 --> 12:53.172
[inmate] Working hard,
or hardly working?

12:54.211 --> 12:58.111
Yeah, it's your play, man.

13:12.462 --> 13:14.030
[Santos] All right.

13:14.065 --> 13:16.164
[gate buzzing]

13:27.711 --> 13:29.413
Yo, we got a problem?

13:29.446 --> 13:32.383
Nope.

13:32.416 --> 13:36.019
Hey.

13:36.053 --> 13:37.922
So, what's up?
You keeping an eye on us?

13:37.922 --> 13:39.057
Just minding my own business.

13:39.057 --> 13:40.591
Yeah, so am I.

13:40.624 --> 13:43.961
Hey! Best buds already.

13:43.995 --> 13:46.363
Melts my heart.

13:46.397 --> 13:48.947
Mind if I cut in?

13:59.443 --> 14:01.611
Used to be MS-13 littered
this place with corpses.

14:01.644 --> 14:03.847
Now it's these Corto Maltese.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.950
Last month,
I had to deport seven of 'em.

14:05.982 --> 14:08.086
Got a punctured lung
as a parting gift.

14:08.119 --> 14:10.221
Sorry for throwing you in
with animals,

14:10.254 --> 14:11.655
but I had to make a point.

14:11.690 --> 14:15.458
Now, let's bypass the bullshit
and get down to business.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.260
Okay.

14:16.260 --> 14:19.429
So, no hard feelings?

14:19.429 --> 14:20.898
Sure.

14:20.932 --> 14:23.768
Believe me, I had your back.

14:23.768 --> 14:24.869
Let me get that single
ready for you.

14:24.869 --> 14:28.304
Move you out of the jungle.

14:28.337 --> 14:30.573
Hey.

14:30.607 --> 14:32.710
What's up?

14:32.743 --> 14:34.577
Don't.

14:34.611 --> 14:36.780
I'm not helping you.

14:36.813 --> 14:38.783
-You said we were good.
-We are.

14:38.817 --> 14:43.817
And I'm not helping you...
or anybody. It's not personal.

14:44.154 --> 14:46.490
You fucking with me again?

14:46.523 --> 14:48.125
No.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.794
So you wanna be in there?

14:50.827 --> 14:52.778
That's right.

14:58.403 --> 15:02.807
You know what happens
to the cop who's in cahoots
with the boss?

15:02.840 --> 15:07.278
Nothing good. [laughs]

15:07.312 --> 15:10.461
Enjoy your stay, kid.

15:38.808 --> 15:43.458
[inmates grunting and groaning]

15:45.783 --> 15:47.184
[inmate exclaims and gasps]

15:47.184 --> 15:49.386
-Rent is due, motherfucker!
-We don't want any problems!

15:49.386 --> 15:52.056
Too late!
You left the family.

15:52.089 --> 15:55.326
They'll slice you up
when you get home.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.462
Or we'll slice you up now.

15:58.495 --> 16:03.145
Or you pay the rent.
Your call.

16:03.835 --> 16:04.835
We'll do it.

16:04.835 --> 16:07.937
-Rafi, no!
-Shut the fuck up.

16:07.971 --> 16:10.807
-I said we'll do it. Who?
-[groaning] Rafi.

16:10.841 --> 16:13.677
Your new celly. The cop.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.480
-Why him?
-'Cause he's a cop,
motherfucker!

16:16.514 --> 16:21.514
You saw him in the yard.
He's down with the guards.

16:24.389 --> 16:28.288
Twelve hours, <i>puto.</i>

16:59.023 --> 17:01.725
[barks]

17:01.759 --> 17:04.496
Great. Dumbest dog ever.

17:04.528 --> 17:07.298
He can ring a doorbell
with his nose.

17:07.332 --> 17:08.532
I've seen dumber.

17:08.566 --> 17:12.566
-[barks]
-Stay away from me.

17:18.409 --> 17:20.411
What you did to those cops...

17:20.444 --> 17:23.682
You messed things up
for a lot of people,
including me.

17:23.714 --> 17:26.584
I think I deserve an answer.
What the hell happened?

17:26.617 --> 17:30.122
When you invited me
to be a Titan,
I told you what I was.

17:30.154 --> 17:32.423
But you didn't listen
'cause that's not what
you wanted to hear.

17:32.457 --> 17:35.693
You're right.
I didn't listen.

17:35.727 --> 17:40.596
Being a Titan
isn't about being perfect.

17:40.631 --> 17:41.632
I...

17:41.664 --> 17:44.434
I killed a guy once.

17:44.469 --> 17:48.205
And I clawed him to pieces.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.474
So, maybe we should both
be locked up.

17:50.508 --> 17:55.508
What we do...
Other people count on us
to help them.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.048
Well, they shouldn't.

17:58.082 --> 18:02.819
[barking]

18:02.853 --> 18:05.056
[tires squeal]

18:05.088 --> 18:08.459
You gotta get
out of here. Now!

18:08.492 --> 18:12.864
No, no, no!
Do you really want
to hurt somebody else?

18:12.897 --> 18:17.067
-[Krypto continues barking]
-[soldier] Move, move!
Come on, now!

18:17.101 --> 18:18.469
Come on.

18:18.502 --> 18:21.571
[soldier] Move, move!

18:21.605 --> 18:22.636
[woman scoffs]

18:25.609 --> 18:28.613
Mmm. Mmm,
these lemon things
are delicious.

18:28.645 --> 18:31.648
They get all their food
from the Ritz Carlton
down the street.

18:31.682 --> 18:34.919
Leftovers from big
muckity-muck conventions.

18:34.951 --> 18:36.751
Bon appetit.

18:40.791 --> 18:45.529
So, what brings you
to this fine ding
establishment?

18:45.563 --> 18:48.865
Sorry, that was...
Uh, you don't have
to answer that.

18:48.898 --> 18:52.269
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

18:52.303 --> 18:55.105
I left.

18:55.138 --> 18:57.407
My family's fucked up.

18:57.442 --> 19:00.444
Yeah, can't relate.

19:00.478 --> 19:03.413
You look at
all these grown-ups,
and you...

19:03.413 --> 19:05.450
You think
that they have the answers.

19:05.482 --> 19:09.287
Then you find out
they just have no idea.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.689
I think it's a test.

19:11.722 --> 19:15.092
The longer we don't break free,
the dumber we are.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.996
Mmm. Sixteen years.

19:19.028 --> 19:21.465
That's like a D-minus for me.

19:21.499 --> 19:24.101
Have you ever heard
of a Labord's chameleon?

19:24.134 --> 19:25.435
Can't say I have.

19:25.470 --> 19:28.439
It's a lizard species
in Madagascar.

19:28.472 --> 19:30.340
The females lay their eggs
before the winter

19:30.374 --> 19:33.411
and then all the adults
die before they hatch.

19:33.443 --> 19:36.180
So, from the minute
you're born, no parents.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.949
You're totally on your own.

19:37.982 --> 19:42.051
Yeah. Only downside is,
your life span's
only five months.

19:42.086 --> 19:44.489
And you're, uh,
green and scaly.

19:44.521 --> 19:49.359
But... you're totally free,
all your life.

19:49.393 --> 19:51.461
No rules, no bullshit.

19:51.496 --> 19:54.298
No adults fucking you up.

19:54.332 --> 19:59.332
[scoffs] We should
have been lizards.

20:01.071 --> 20:04.342
Time to go.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.809
You don't have to.

20:06.844 --> 20:10.443
Mind your business, kid.

20:15.353 --> 20:16.853
It's okay.

20:30.769 --> 20:33.270
You disappear on me again,
I'll fucking kill you.

20:33.304 --> 20:36.707
Why wait?

20:36.740 --> 20:40.778
Fine.

20:40.810 --> 20:44.481
[groans]

20:44.515 --> 20:47.917
I'm not a kid.

20:47.951 --> 20:49.451
[groaning]

20:55.925 --> 20:59.195
[straining]

20:59.230 --> 21:03.366
Please, don't kill me.

21:03.401 --> 21:07.601
Please... Please...
[grunts]

21:12.242 --> 21:16.747
[Rachel gasping]

21:16.779 --> 21:18.279
[exclaims]

21:37.034 --> 21:39.069
I'm sorry.

21:39.104 --> 21:44.104
Being a lizard would be
considerably less freaky.

21:45.409 --> 21:48.858
You're fucking awesome.

22:06.196 --> 22:07.696
[snarling]

22:15.806 --> 22:17.807
[panting]

22:17.840 --> 22:19.191
Oh, shit.

22:23.079 --> 22:26.317
[gargoyle growling]

22:26.349 --> 22:28.419
[exclaiming and yelling]

22:28.451 --> 22:33.324
-No! No! [screams]
-[gargoyle screeching]

22:33.356 --> 22:37.094
[indistinct chatter over radio]

22:37.126 --> 22:40.498
[dominos clacking]

22:40.530 --> 22:43.080
[shiv scratching]

22:56.547 --> 23:01.419
When's the escape?

23:01.451 --> 23:04.521
I saw you looking
at the guards at the gate.

23:04.555 --> 23:08.558
So, you ratted us out, huh?

23:08.593 --> 23:12.063
If I did,
you'd all be in solitary.

23:12.063 --> 23:14.298
If I can see what you're up to,
soon enough, they will.

23:14.298 --> 23:16.835
The fucking snitch
giving us tips?

23:16.867 --> 23:20.038
Just facts.
Four guards on the ground.

23:20.070 --> 23:24.407
Two in the tower with M14s
with 20 rounds each.

23:24.442 --> 23:26.678
-You got no chance.
-Yeah.

23:26.711 --> 23:29.013
You're so smart, huh?

23:29.047 --> 23:34.047
Why don't you tell us
how we're gonna stay alive?

23:34.484 --> 23:36.285
I'd kill me.

24:00.044 --> 24:01.094
[sighs]

24:10.000 --> 24:11.890
I could fucking kill you.

24:11.923 --> 24:16.760
Make it easier on all of us.

24:16.794 --> 24:19.096
But that's not who I am.

24:19.128 --> 24:20.531
We're not murders.

24:20.531 --> 24:23.768
That's why we left
the Corto Maltese
and tried to go clean.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.071
Immigration picked us up.
And they're gonna deport us.

24:27.105 --> 24:30.040
At home, we're deserters,
just like in here.

24:30.075 --> 24:35.046
So, the Corto Maltese
will slaughter us like pigs.

24:35.079 --> 24:38.682
We have no choice
but to break out.

24:38.682 --> 24:41.652
So, unless
you have real answers...

24:41.652 --> 24:44.201
shut the fuck up.

24:57.035 --> 25:00.170
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

25:00.170 --> 25:01.170
Yeah.

25:06.310 --> 25:11.310
Hey. You know they're gonna
keep coming after me, right?

25:13.349 --> 25:14.684
Let them try.

25:14.719 --> 25:16.632
This is my mess,
not yours.

25:16.632 --> 25:18.689
This is what the Titans do.

25:18.722 --> 25:22.000
We have each other's backs.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.026
So, where are they?
The other Titans.

25:27.464 --> 25:29.567
You know what,
maybe I should do

25:29.599 --> 25:32.636
what Dick wanted me to do
in the first place.

25:32.670 --> 25:33.805
Call in the big guns.

25:33.837 --> 25:35.339
We're gonna use guns?

25:35.373 --> 25:40.373
No, it's just a metaphor.
Calling Bruce Wayne.

25:41.145 --> 25:44.013
[automated voice]
Zone six, unauthorized access.

25:44.013 --> 25:44.781
What's that?

25:44.781 --> 25:47.932
Zone six is the roof.

25:50.354 --> 25:51.555
[soldier 1] Hurry, now!

25:51.588 --> 25:52.722
Everybody down on the floor!

25:52.757 --> 25:54.326
[soldier 2] Stay where you are!

25:54.358 --> 25:57.227
-[soldier 1] Hands,
let me see your hands!
-[soldier 2] Don't move!

25:57.227 --> 25:57.961
[barking]

25:57.961 --> 25:59.430
[soldier 3] Target ID'd.

25:59.462 --> 26:02.165
[Mercy]
Bring Subject 13 in alive.

26:02.199 --> 26:03.299
Kill the other one.

26:03.334 --> 26:05.702
[continues barking]

26:05.736 --> 26:08.538
[soldier 1]
Shut that damn dog up!

26:08.571 --> 26:09.807
[soldier groans]

26:09.840 --> 26:11.208
[soldier 2] Bag him!

26:11.240 --> 26:13.042
[Krypto whimpers]

26:13.076 --> 26:16.579
[soldiers grunt]

26:16.614 --> 26:19.817
[both grunting]

26:19.851 --> 26:23.186
[soldier grunting and yelling]

26:23.220 --> 26:25.388
[both grunting]

26:25.422 --> 26:27.071
Ha! Ha! Oh!

26:31.194 --> 26:32.395
[soldier yelling]

26:32.429 --> 26:33.530
[grunting]

26:33.564 --> 26:34.763
[growls]

26:40.105 --> 26:42.441
Change of plan,
tranquilizers only.

26:42.473 --> 26:45.009
-[Gar growling over tablet]
-Bring the tiger in alive.

26:45.042 --> 26:48.746
[Gar snarling and growling]

26:48.779 --> 26:50.714
Screw this. I'm switching
to Kryptonite bullets.

26:50.748 --> 26:53.448
No! No Kryptonite!

27:00.523 --> 27:02.159
[soldier] Tranqs!

27:02.192 --> 27:04.494
[Gar groans]

27:04.528 --> 27:06.329
No.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.698
[whines]

27:07.731 --> 27:10.534
[breathing heavily]

27:10.535 --> 27:11.535
[grunting]

27:11.535 --> 27:15.439
Stop!

27:15.472 --> 27:16.773
It's okay.

27:16.807 --> 27:18.275
I'm not here to hurt you.

27:18.308 --> 27:20.278
Who are you?

27:20.311 --> 27:23.146
My name is Mercy Graves,
I work with Eve Watson.

27:23.180 --> 27:26.150
Eve?

27:26.182 --> 27:27.550
Is she here?

27:27.585 --> 27:31.288
No, she sent me instead.

27:31.321 --> 27:33.422
[Gar wheezing]

27:39.563 --> 27:42.299
It's okay.

27:42.334 --> 27:45.502
It's just tranquilizers
to calm him.

27:45.502 --> 27:47.738
I'm here to help you.

27:47.771 --> 27:49.941
That's not what it feels like.

27:49.973 --> 27:52.910
Do you want to hurt me?

27:52.943 --> 27:54.811
I'm not sure.

27:54.846 --> 27:57.580
Did you want to hurt
those police officers?

27:57.580 --> 27:58.915
I don't know.
I don't think so.

27:58.950 --> 28:00.951
These are not...

28:00.984 --> 28:03.753
easy questions, Conner.

28:03.788 --> 28:06.124
Let us help you.

28:06.156 --> 28:09.826
After all, we created you.

28:09.861 --> 28:12.630
We can fix you.

28:12.663 --> 28:13.897
"Fix"?

28:13.931 --> 28:16.534
What's happening to you,
it's our fault.

28:16.534 --> 28:17.801
An imbalance
we didn't consider,

28:17.801 --> 28:19.670
but now that we understand it,

28:19.703 --> 28:23.641
we can stop it.

28:23.673 --> 28:27.411
All you have to do...

28:27.443 --> 28:29.394
is come home.

28:32.717 --> 28:37.354
[sighs]

28:37.387 --> 28:39.488
[door unlocks]

28:50.768 --> 28:55.006
What is this place?

28:55.038 --> 29:00.038
I've brought someone
who can help us.

29:14.525 --> 29:18.424
[indistinct conversations]

29:41.652 --> 29:42.752
Hey, hey.

29:42.752 --> 29:44.188
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

29:44.188 --> 29:45.890
We've been here all morning.

29:45.923 --> 29:49.526
-I'm bored.
-Well, bored's
better than dead.

29:49.559 --> 29:50.728
Take a nap.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.861
I'm not tired.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.708
Neither are they.

30:03.740 --> 30:07.443
We stick together
till tonight.

30:07.478 --> 30:09.012
It's a suicide mission.

30:09.047 --> 30:10.114
We're gonna make it.

30:10.147 --> 30:13.550
Will you shut the fuck up,
all of you?

30:13.550 --> 30:14.919
[Luis] It's not suicide.

30:14.919 --> 30:16.299
You think
we can't beat the guards

30:16.299 --> 30:17.354
with their guns,

30:17.387 --> 30:18.788
but we can.

30:18.788 --> 30:22.826
You know why?

30:22.859 --> 30:25.028
Alazul.

30:25.063 --> 30:27.164
You know Alazul?

30:27.198 --> 30:29.534
In our village,
Alazul is our hero.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.935
He lives between the moon
and the stars.

30:31.935 --> 30:33.171
And in the time
of greatest need,

30:33.171 --> 30:35.406
he flies down and saves you.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.141
A bird that comes in the night
and saves people?

30:38.174 --> 30:39.309
Yes.

30:39.344 --> 30:41.045
He's gonna save us tonight...

30:41.045 --> 30:42.846
and we'll be free.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.481
Okay, Luis...

30:44.481 --> 30:45.481
there's no Alazul.

30:45.481 --> 30:46.384
Yes, there is.

30:46.384 --> 30:47.317
[Dick] Then why are you here?

30:47.317 --> 30:48.420
The gangs that came after you,

30:48.420 --> 30:50.255
Immigration
that came after you.

30:50.288 --> 30:51.689
This bird's
supposed to save you?

30:51.721 --> 30:53.758
Where the hell has he been?

30:53.758 --> 30:54.724
Huh?

30:54.724 --> 30:56.826
He's real.

30:56.826 --> 30:58.494
And tonight...

30:58.528 --> 31:02.066
he's gonna save us.

31:02.099 --> 31:03.750
You'll see.

31:21.085 --> 31:22.734
You'll see.

31:28.159 --> 31:31.328
[Walter]
Subject 13 is in stasis.

31:31.328 --> 31:32.430
[Mercy] I'll call Mr. Luthor

31:32.430 --> 31:35.098
to get instructions
on recalibration.

31:35.098 --> 31:36.267
How's our other guest?

31:36.300 --> 31:39.136
Well, I'd like to say
all bark and no bite,

31:39.170 --> 31:43.819
but I wouldn't put
money on it.

31:48.813 --> 31:50.847
[keypad beeping]

31:50.881 --> 31:52.317
Mr. Logan. I'm Mercy Graves.

31:52.317 --> 31:54.618
It's an honor to meet you.

31:54.653 --> 31:57.020
Can I interest you
in something else to eat?

31:57.054 --> 31:58.189
Grass-fed ribeye?

31:58.221 --> 32:01.092
Chia pudding?
Name anything you'd like.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.227
How about
letting me out of here?

32:03.260 --> 32:05.596
I'm afraid
that's not available
on DoorDash.

32:05.628 --> 32:08.398
[Gar chuckles]

32:08.432 --> 32:10.000
What have you done
to Conner?

32:10.034 --> 32:11.868
Exactly as he wanted.

32:11.868 --> 32:12.869
We didn't force him
to come back.

32:12.869 --> 32:14.403
It was his choice.

32:14.403 --> 32:15.673
[scoffs]

32:15.707 --> 32:18.642
Yeah, 'cause you guys
are all about
the free will here.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.010
Loving mine, by the way.

32:20.044 --> 32:21.712
My apologies
for any discomfort.

32:21.746 --> 32:23.548
We just wanted
to contain your transformation

32:23.580 --> 32:26.483
to ensure
we had the opportunity to talk.

32:26.518 --> 32:30.721
[exhales] Let me guess,
you guys can "fix" me, too.

32:30.753 --> 32:32.022
No.

32:32.056 --> 32:34.424
But I could help you.

32:34.459 --> 32:39.459
I could offer you
what Niles Caulder never did.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.268
Dr. Caulder
and CADMUS Industries

32:44.268 --> 32:49.006
have crossed paths
from time to time.

32:49.039 --> 32:51.041
He's a brilliant man.

32:51.075 --> 32:54.178
Though,
not entirely altruistic,

32:54.211 --> 32:56.680
no matter how he wishes
to appear.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.848
He saved you.

32:58.848 --> 32:59.916
Gave you the gift of life,

32:59.916 --> 33:01.919
but only as it suited
his needs.

33:01.951 --> 33:06.356
His purpose.

33:06.391 --> 33:08.192
Did he ever ask you
what you want,

33:08.226 --> 33:10.060
for yourself?

33:10.094 --> 33:12.329
Has anyone?

33:12.363 --> 33:15.266
Or do they just
string you along...

33:15.299 --> 33:16.468
using you for their own ends,

33:16.500 --> 33:20.270
with little concern for you
or your welfare?

33:20.305 --> 33:23.708
CADMUS will focus on you.

33:23.741 --> 33:28.741
Help you explore your powers
to their fullest.

33:28.878 --> 33:31.714
Help you be...

33:31.749 --> 33:35.648
everything you want to be.

33:39.123 --> 33:43.173
What I wanna be is a Titan.

33:48.333 --> 33:52.383
[siren wailing in distance]

33:54.471 --> 33:56.740
[woman]
I was out here last night,

33:56.773 --> 34:00.278
but it was too dark to see.

34:00.310 --> 34:03.461
[police siren chirps]

34:07.618 --> 34:12.222
Dick, I need you
to call me back.

34:12.255 --> 34:16.226
[exhales]
I tracked Rachel down
to a soup kitchen.

34:16.226 --> 34:18.929
Look, she's not just missing.

34:18.963 --> 34:20.612
It's worse.

34:49.827 --> 34:52.628
[gate buzzing]

34:52.663 --> 34:55.362
Give me my points!

35:08.012 --> 35:09.012
Okay, that's it.

35:09.045 --> 35:10.213
Get inside, now.

35:10.248 --> 35:11.481
Now, now.

35:11.514 --> 35:13.150
Get in.

35:13.184 --> 35:15.052
[Luis] Hey, hey! Santos.

35:15.085 --> 35:16.320
[alarm blaring]

35:16.353 --> 35:20.090
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

35:20.123 --> 35:22.974
[inmates clamoring]

35:29.266 --> 35:33.603
Move! Go!
Get out of the fucking way!

35:33.637 --> 35:35.586
Call a medic.

35:43.213 --> 35:44.563
Too late.

35:50.753 --> 35:53.753
[praying in Spanish]

36:03.766 --> 36:05.235
[guard] Lockdown...

36:05.268 --> 36:06.936
until your transport tonight.

36:06.971 --> 36:11.641
Warden's orders.

36:11.675 --> 36:13.474
[door locks]

36:33.664 --> 36:35.465
If you say
we should have killed you,

36:35.500 --> 36:40.338
I'll break your fucking face.

36:40.371 --> 36:43.173
Don't go through
with this tonight.

36:43.206 --> 36:44.409
[scoffs]

36:44.442 --> 36:47.244
Now you fucking care?

36:47.277 --> 36:50.213
With Santos,
you had no chance.

36:50.248 --> 36:52.516
Without him...

36:52.550 --> 36:54.853
Santos being killed...

36:54.885 --> 36:57.320
that's your sign saying,
don't do this.

36:57.355 --> 37:01.625
If you can't see that,
you're blind.

37:01.657 --> 37:03.157
I'm blind?

37:09.099 --> 37:11.168
If God wants me dead,

37:11.202 --> 37:13.403
then it'll be my time.

37:13.438 --> 37:15.239
But if I'm
still alive tomorrow,

37:15.273 --> 37:16.740
then that's my sign.

37:16.775 --> 37:19.443
And it means that I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

37:19.476 --> 37:21.878
Now, he's giving me
a chance...

37:21.911 --> 37:24.548
to be something else.

37:24.581 --> 37:29.532
Maybe you're the one
who's blind.

37:37.327 --> 37:38.677
[exhales]

37:52.443 --> 37:53.510
[door unlocks]

37:53.543 --> 37:55.643
[door opening]

37:58.650 --> 38:00.150
Rise and shine, boys.

38:00.184 --> 38:01.652
It's 6:00 a.m.

38:01.686 --> 38:03.286
Say goodbye to America.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.358
Hope you had a nice stay.

38:07.391 --> 38:10.391
[handcuffs clicking]

38:29.000 --> 38:31.746
[guard] Sit tight.

38:35.186 --> 38:37.789
All right,
we just need to get
the receiver's signature

38:37.822 --> 38:42.293
on the transport manifesto.

38:42.326 --> 38:43.695
[handcuffs clicking]

38:43.728 --> 38:47.431
All right, load 'em up.

38:47.465 --> 38:50.201
[handcuffs clicking]

38:50.201 --> 38:51.369
[guard] Time to go, gentlemen.

38:51.369 --> 38:56.018
-On your feet.
-[door creaking]

39:06.682 --> 39:08.318
Now.

[Len grunts] Hey.

40:09.614 --> 40:12.550
-Cuff him!
-[guard] Get on the ground.

40:12.583 --> 40:15.786
[Dick groans]

40:15.820 --> 40:18.820
The man who won't help anyone.

[wind whistling]

40:47.518 --> 40:50.668
[traffic in distance]

41:23.353 --> 41:25.257
I spoke to Mr. Luthor.

41:25.289 --> 41:30.289
There have been some changes
regarding Subject 13
and Project Rakshasa.

41:30.289 --> 41:33.097
With all due respect,
Ms. Graves,

41:33.097 --> 41:34.532
I don't answer to you.

41:34.565 --> 41:36.333
Well,
that's one of the changes.

41:36.367 --> 41:40.972
Now you do.

41:41.005 --> 41:42.806
[Walter] What do we do
about him?

41:42.840 --> 41:44.876
[Mercy] He says
he wants to be a Titan,

41:44.909 --> 41:48.411
reunited with his team.

41:48.411 --> 41:53.096
I think it's an excellent idea.
