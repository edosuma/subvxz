00:07.920 --> 00:09.920
Relax, they'll be here.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.040
The bank's gonna close in five minutes.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.360
- Sure it wasn't a bogus tip?
- No, it's real.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.280
l've been on this long enough.
l know the difference.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.000
Besides, l can feel it.
l can feel them. l'm inside their heads.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.840
Just as long as you keep yours!

00:26.800 --> 00:29.840
Message received, Agent Scully.
Loud and clear.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.560
Position Five, this is Agent Willis.
Do you copy?

00:52.120 --> 00:54.400
- What, are you nervous?
- Nope.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.600
l just don't want our luck to run out.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.840
Baby, you are my luck.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.960
And no matter what happens,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.360
whenever l look up at the stars,

01:07.280 --> 01:10.240
l know you're gonna be
looking up at the same ones.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.920
The same ones, baby.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.800
You make every day like New Year's Eve!

01:29.880 --> 01:33.440
Come on, people! Get down on the floor,
now! Get down on the floor!

01:34.960 --> 01:38.800
l ain't messin' around here! You! Down
on the floor, now! Now, or you're dead!

01:38.880 --> 01:43.440
Everyone! Down on the floor!
Or l'll execute every one of you! Move!

01:44.400 --> 01:47.320
Move! Put the money in the bag. Now!
Now! Move it!

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
- Faster!
- Dupre!

01:49.960 --> 01:52.800
Drop the gun! FBl! Drop the gun!

01:52.880 --> 01:54.840
Now!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
Clear!

02:18.680 --> 02:21.360
Watch him carefully. 11 minutes, 55 seconds.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.280
Clear!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.280
Come on, Jack.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.640
He's been flatlined for over 12 minutes.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.120
Another amp of epi,
and we'll go again at 360.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.680
Clear!

02:34.840 --> 02:37.040
Still no pulse.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.120
We've done all we can. l'm sorry.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.920
All right, let's call off.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.280
- You want me to pronounce?
- No! You can't give up on him.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.440
- lt's been over 13 minutes. He's dead.
- Go up to 400.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.360
We lost him. Let him go.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.000
l'm a doctor! Go up to 400, or l'll do it myself!

02:57.160 --> 02:59.120
Clear!

03:00.400 --> 03:01.720
Still no pulse.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.680
Give him another amp of epi intracardial
and go up to 400 again.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.760
Do it!

03:11.360 --> 03:13.760
Clear!

03:13.840 --> 03:14.960
Again!

03:15.840 --> 03:18.520
- Come on, Jack.
- Clear!

03:19.840 --> 03:21.560
Come on!

03:24.200 --> 03:27.360
We got a rhythm.
Don't ask me how, but he's back!

03:28.520 --> 03:31.000
BP's 80 over 50 and climbing. 90 over 50.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.440
Hello, Mr Goldbaum.
How are we doing tonight?

05:24.520 --> 05:28.560
l'm just going to adjust your drip.
l'll check on you again later.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.400
Any word from Willis?

07:04.480 --> 07:07.480
Still missing. He hasn't
been home or to the office.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.720
l heard something about a mutilation...

07:09.800 --> 07:14.440
Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand
were severed by surgical shears.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.840
We lifted prints. They're Willis's.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.880
He said he was chasing this guy
for almost a year?

07:19.960 --> 07:22.600
He lived the case.
lt was all he ever thought about.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.120
What are you thinking?

07:25.200 --> 07:28.760
That maybe this is some kind
of post-trauma psychosis.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.280
Like the way soldiers sometimes
mutilate the body of a dead enemy.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.240
That still doesn't explain
why he would just vanish.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.920
Dupre's partner... Who was she?

07:40.720 --> 07:42.720
Lula Phillips.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.440
They met while she was serving a 10-year
sentence for manslaughter in Maryland.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.560
- He was a prison guard.
- Until the warden found out their secret.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.240
According to Lula's cell mate,
they carried on quite a torrid romance.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.120
lt says here she was released
on May 2nd, 1993.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.240
One week before the first robbery
at Annapolis Savings and Loan.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.080
A 65-year-old female teller
was pistol-whipped.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.560
Died from a massive subdural haemorrhage.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.200
She didn't put the money
in the bag fast enough!

08:10.280 --> 08:13.560
- Lovely couple!
- Well, apparently they took turns.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.080
One pulling ajob,
while the other one drove getaway.

08:17.160 --> 08:22.040
Between the two of them they've killed seven
people and got away with close to $100,000.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.320
That's a lot of money,
now that she doesn't have to split it.

08:25.400 --> 08:30.200
Well, we're putting her face out there.
Local newspapers, America's Most Wanted...

08:30.280 --> 08:32.280
Am l boring you?

08:32.360 --> 08:36.520
- They were married.
- Yeah, last May in Atlantic City. So what?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.679
So l don't think this was a
simple necrophiliac mutilation.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.919
Willis sliced and diced those fingers
to get at the wedding ring.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.520
Anybody here?

09:08.560 --> 09:10.920
Lula?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
Baby, baby, baby...

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
Damn!

10:03.880 --> 10:05.440
lt's a left thumb print.

10:05.520 --> 10:10.520
Look at these two bifurcations here. Whoever
was holding that cleaver used his left hand.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.520
- ''Whoever''? lt was Willis.
- Willis is right-handed.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.760
l checked his pistol grip at the armoury.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.920
But the bank surveillance tapes
show Dupre is left-handed.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.120
l'm not sure where you're going with this.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.800
How long did Willis flatline
before you revived him?

10:23.880 --> 10:25.440
Just over 13 minutes.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.680
This EKG strip recorded
his cardiac activity at the time.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.880
ln your medical opinion,
what does that look like?

10:31.960 --> 10:34.240
lt could be anything.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.960
lnstrument malfunction,
electrical overload...

10:37.040 --> 10:39.120
But what does it look like?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.920
Two heartbeats.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.880
Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest
at the exact same time, right?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.320
Right...

10:48.400 --> 10:51.400
For a period of minutes,
both men were technically dead.

10:51.480 --> 10:55.360
- Technically. But we resuscitated Willis.
- You resuscitated his body.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.800
Mulder...

10:56.880 --> 10:59.160
Two men died in that crash room, Scully.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.840
One man came back. The question is,

11:03.320 --> 11:05.120
which one?

11:12.720 --> 11:16.840
What can you tell me about
near-death experiences, Agent Scully?

11:17.600 --> 11:22.080
The usual stuff. The tunnel, the light, people
rising up and viewing their own bodies.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.800
As a scientist,
how do you account for the phenomenon?

11:24.880 --> 11:27.560
Some sort of dissociative
hallucinatory activity.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.280
Half of all the adults who have had a
near-death experience cannot wear a watch.

11:33.360 --> 11:38.960
The increased electrical activity in their
bodies renders the watches inoperable.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.240
l know this sounds kooky,
but, as any biologist will tell you,

11:42.320 --> 11:45.320
when cells die and genetic material
begins to unfold,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.720
a tremendous charge of energy is released.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.400
Doctor Varnes believes this is responsible

11:50.480 --> 11:53.600
for the transformational nature
of the experience.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.760
People do return from the
event profoundly changed.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.760
Changed how?

11:58.840 --> 12:03.040
Personality shifts, perceived
psychic abilities, increased zest for life.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.880
What about the negative consequences?

12:05.960 --> 12:08.480
They're rare. But in the process of dying

12:08.560 --> 12:11.400
there is a time
during which the body is vulnerable.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.480
- l don't understand.
- Well,

12:13.560 --> 12:17.600
there was a pilot in my support group
who died in a commuter plane crash,

12:17.680 --> 12:19.800
along with his three passengers.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.240
This was a few years ago.
Now, he recalls floating up

12:23.320 --> 12:28.320
in a brilliant aura of light, and then feeling
an overwhelming need to return to his body.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.800
He was revived in the ambulance on the way
to the hospital. The only survivor.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.200
Soon after that, the visions started.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.760
Visions of making love to his wife,
in ways that weren't in his memory.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.880
Turns out that one of the dead passengers on
the plane was having an affair with his wife.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.280
The dead passenger's memory, his...

12:46.360 --> 12:49.480
his consciousness,
had survived through the pilot.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.200
- What happened?
- The pilot became increasingly disoriented.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.280
Schizophrenic, his doctor claims.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.320
He strangled his wife
with an extension cord.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.040
That's a nice story!

13:06.480 --> 13:10.760
l don't discount the near-death experience.
lt can be explained empirically,

13:10.840 --> 13:14.440
- by stimulation of the temporal lobe.
- l sense a big ''but'' coming!

13:14.520 --> 13:19.000
l still believe that Jack's disappearance
can be explained in psychological terms.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.480
For instance?

13:20.560 --> 13:24.280
The stress of the case, the trauma
of being shot, Jack's personality...

13:24.360 --> 13:28.280
- How well do you know him?
- We dated. For almost a year.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.600
He was my instructor at the Academy.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.400
The plot thickens!

13:35.720 --> 13:38.440
We even had the same birthday.

13:38.520 --> 13:43.000
We used to celebrate in some dive
in Stafford that had a slanted pool table.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.440
But it was always so hard for Jack to

13:45.520 --> 13:48.080
relax. lt was impossible for him, really.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.680
He was always so... intense,
so relentlessly determined.

13:51.760 --> 13:56.360
Do you believe he's predisposed
to this type of psychotic episode?

13:56.440 --> 13:59.640
lt's a long way from saying Jack
had a near-death experience

13:59.720 --> 14:03.400
to saying his body's been
inhabited by Warren Dupre.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.760
A long way!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.400
What the hell...?!

14:14.240 --> 14:17.600
- You're such a creature of habit, Tommy.
- Who the hell are you?

14:17.680 --> 14:20.680
- Get outta bed.
- l ain't got no clothes on.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.800
Get outta bed!
l don't wanna shoot you lying down.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.400
Who are you - the rent man?
Cos l'm all paid up. l swear. l'm not kiddin'.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.520
- Come on, you can go ask Cosmo.
- Shut up!

14:34.080 --> 14:36.000
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

14:36.080 --> 14:39.360
- Your sister.
- Huh! Lula?

14:40.200 --> 14:44.400
Look, l don't know. l don't know, l swear!
l was just waiting to see her on the news.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.200
What'd l tell you?

14:47.280 --> 14:49.000
Check it out.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.120
The sound's busted.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.000
Looks like they're gonna find her
before you do, pal!

15:04.080 --> 15:07.440
ls that what you think?
lt's not what l think.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.240
l miss her, Tommy.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.680
l miss her so bad!

15:19.760 --> 15:21.760
That's why l came back.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.480
- Do l know you from somewhere?
- Everything l see,

15:27.400 --> 15:28.960
l see her.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.320
Jesus, man! You're bleeding.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.600
Even ugliness is beautiful... because of her.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.720
- OK, what are you doing?
- You set us up, Tommy.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.600
You sold us out to the FBl!

15:52.440 --> 15:53.960
Dupre?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.760
Neighbours heard a gunshot,
but nobody checked it out.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.720
Patrol guys responded this morning
to an anonymous 911 and found him here.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.160
Except the rats found him first.
The victim's name was Thomas Phillips.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.240
That's Lula's brother.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.840
There's not a lot of family resemblance left,
between the rats and the .45 in the face!

16:21.920 --> 16:25.520
- Oh, l hate this nicotine stuff.
- What's his story?

16:25.600 --> 16:29.280
Oh, he's single. He's lived here
alone for the past seven months.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.280
A few priors - small stuff, mostly.
B and E, narcotics possession.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.480
Nothing like his big sister.

16:35.560 --> 16:40.040
- Was the TV on when they found him?
- No. Why?

16:41.240 --> 16:45.120
l don't think Tommy was much of a reader,
since he doesn't have any books.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.720
From the position of the body, l'd say maybe
he was watching the tube when he was shot.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.720
- Print kit's over there. Knock yourself out!
- Get out of my way, Ace!

16:53.800 --> 16:57.520
Regulations state, to gain access
to a crime scene, you gotta show lD!

16:57.600 --> 16:59.720
Looks like you were right.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
Excuse me.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.320
Jack...

17:08.200 --> 17:10.359
ls there a problem here?

17:10.440 --> 17:13.359
No, l just... l don't have any lD.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.160
Would you tell this gentleman who l am?

17:16.240 --> 17:18.480
Officer, this is Agent Jack Willis.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.480
Violent Crimes Section
of the Washington Bureau.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.560
Come on, let's talk out here.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.960
l was just doing my job, miss!

17:26.040 --> 17:30.440
Willis, what happened?! Half the Bureau's
been looking for you. Where have you been?

17:30.520 --> 17:35.200
l don't know. l just... wasn't myself.
l just kinda... woke up out on the street!

17:35.280 --> 17:38.720
- l'm taking you back to the hospital.
- No way! l'm staying right here!

17:38.800 --> 17:41.040
- You're not ready to be here.
- Who says?!

17:41.120 --> 17:45.480
Jack, you're recovering from a major trauma.
lt's a miracle you're even able to walk!

17:45.560 --> 17:48.560
- This is Tommy Phillips' place, right?
- Jack...

17:48.640 --> 17:50.520
Was he killed with a .45?

17:51.840 --> 17:53.840
As a matter of fact, he was.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.360
He was! That's Lula's weapon of choice.

17:56.440 --> 18:01.240
l know these people. l've been after them
for a long time. We're halfway there!

18:03.080 --> 18:06.760
- You did open the book on this one.
- And l'll be there when it's closed!

18:06.840 --> 18:08.440
All right.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.320
But, as a colleague and as a friend,

18:11.400 --> 18:15.480
l recommend you have a full medical
evaluation. Physical and psychological.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.080
All right, fair enough.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.200
Jack! Good to see you back among the living.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.760
- lt's good to be back.
- Jack.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.000
- So what have we got here?
- Mulder here found a print on the TV.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.000
A partial oblique. And it's not the victim's.

18:39.880 --> 18:43.280
Good work, Agent Mulder. l'm impressed!

18:56.120 --> 18:58.120
That's fancy shooting.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.400
l gotta get re-certified before
they give me my weapon back.

19:01.480 --> 19:06.040
Well, by the looks of it, l wouldn't
worry about re-certification.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.440
- ls there anything else you wanted?
- Yeah, it's Scully's birthday.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.680
l was wondering if you'd sign that for me.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.080
Sure! Be glad to.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.680
Always glad to celebrate the good times.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.960
There you go!

19:29.800 --> 19:31.520
Happy birthday, Scully.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.320
You're two months early.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.480
lt's from Willis. l thought you two
had the same birthday?

19:39.520 --> 19:41.480
- We do.
- Well, that's news to him.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.120
l asked him to sign it.
And he signed it with his left hand.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.560
You tested him.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.000
Yeah. After l found out evidence from
the Phillips murder is missing.

19:50.080 --> 19:54.080
- What evidence?
- The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.520
Someone stole it before the lab
had a chance to take a look at it.

19:59.280 --> 20:04.280
- And you think Willis is responsible?
- l'm not sure Willis is Willis.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.480
Can you at least accept the possibility

20:07.560 --> 20:11.120
that, during his near-death experience,
psychic transference occurred?

20:11.200 --> 20:14.320
Can't you accept the possibility
that this isn't an X-File?!

20:15.560 --> 20:17.480
Aside from the expected level
of post-trauma stress,

20:17.560 --> 20:21.840
Jack passed both of his evaluations -
physical and psychological.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.480
Just because someone forgets a birthday,
it doesn't mean that he's been possessed!

20:26.560 --> 20:30.440
When l was studying for my medical boards,
l forgot my birthday, too!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.600
Did you forget how to sign your name?

20:32.680 --> 20:38.200
This is a copy of the automobile requisition
form Willis filed the day before he was shot.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.280
Compare the signatures.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.280
Like l said, Mulder - stress. All right?

20:46.360 --> 20:49.400
lt can significantly affect
someone's cursive standard.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.320
l'm afraid this doesn't prove a thing.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.280
Agent Willis here.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.360
Jack?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.640
- Where are you going?
- We got a break!

21:34.720 --> 21:37.480
- A landlord thinks he's got our girl.
- Hotline?

21:37.560 --> 21:41.200
Yeah. Saw her picture in the post office.
There's the address.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.520
- Jack, can l ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.880
The Phillips murder. The print
Mulder lifted off the TV. lt's missing.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.960
And?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.520
And you were carrying the evidence back.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.320
Are you implying something, Agent Scully?

21:59.480 --> 22:03.880
l don't know anything about any missing
print. Now, l'm ten minutes away

22:03.960 --> 22:07.760
from closing the biggest case
of my career. Are you coming?

22:11.200 --> 22:13.800
- What's the apartment number again?
- 202.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.880
Oh, yeah.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.560
- What was this guy's name?
- Multrevich.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.720
Multrevich?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
All right, all right, all right!

22:31.880 --> 22:34.920
Mr Multrevich, l'm from the FBl. Jack Willis.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.480
- We spoke on the phone, right?
- Oh, yeah.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.920
Have you ever seen this lady?

22:41.400 --> 22:44.320
Yeah. 207. Two days ago.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.760
First and last month - cash.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.360
- Where's 207?
- Down the hallway.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.240
We want you to go back
inside your apartment

22:52.320 --> 22:54.920
and stay away from the windows. Thanks.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.800
Where's our backup?
You said you called them, right?

22:59.880 --> 23:03.760
Should've been here ten minutes ago.
She may be running down a fire escape!

23:03.840 --> 23:06.160
l'm gonna call in again.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.560
Look! That's her!

23:26.040 --> 23:29.240
- Where is she? Where'd she go?!
- l'll check back here.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.320
Face down! Face down!

24:36.400 --> 24:38.960
Hands behind your back!

24:39.040 --> 24:41.040
Now!

24:48.720 --> 24:51.000
She's all yours, Jack.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.760
Yeah... Like a dog on a leash.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
l already cuffed her.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.960
They're for you, Scully. Put 'em on.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.480
- What's going on, Jack?
- Put 'em on. Or l'll blow you in half.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.720
Jack...

25:15.800 --> 25:18.360
Shut up! Put 'em on!

25:41.480 --> 25:44.240
Come on, baby.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.320
Come on, get up, baby.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.880
Look at you...

25:49.960 --> 25:51.960
Your face is all dirty.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.600
- Keep your stinking hands off me!
- Baby!

25:56.600 --> 25:59.280
You ain't gonna believe where l've been.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.880
Sure it's crazy. You don't think
l know it's crazy? This isn't my face!

26:11.960 --> 26:13.960
These aren't my hands!

26:14.040 --> 26:16.800
But it's me in here! And l know you.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.360
l know everything about you, baby.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.600
Come on, ask me something.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.000
Your birthday is April 7th.
Your favourite colour is red.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.560
Come on...

26:26.640 --> 26:29.560
Come on, ask me something else.
Come on, ask me!

26:30.240 --> 26:33.920
OK... OK, what did we do
after we got married?

26:36.080 --> 26:38.080
Right after?

26:39.600 --> 26:43.240
- After that.
- Well... we went down to the beach.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.240
l took out my buck knife
and l sliced open my palm.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.160
And then l slit open your palm.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.880
And we let the blood drip down in the water.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.440
- Then what did you say to me?
- l said

27:10.320 --> 27:14.320
''This is so we can be married
in all the oceans of the world.''

27:21.600 --> 27:23.600
And then l made you a solemn oath.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.000
To never take this ring off my finger.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.000
Ever!

27:34.840 --> 27:37.440
And l mean to keep that promise.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.840
This is... This is just too weird!

27:45.120 --> 27:47.600
l can't believe it's really you!

27:51.760 --> 27:53.760
Don't worry, baby.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.720
lt won't make any difference in the dark.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.280
- We'll be in touch.
- When do l get my reward?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.360
We'll call you.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.880
Now l'm worried. 12 hours with no word?

28:11.640 --> 28:16.320
l don't get it. Why's her car still sitting out
front? Why didn't Willis call for backup?

28:16.400 --> 28:19.080
Because it wasn't Willis
who answered the hotline.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.920
- You heard the recording. lt was his voice.
- Forget it, Bruskin.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.360
Plus which... the manager
just lD'd him and Scully.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.640
l said, forget it, Bruskin!

28:34.120 --> 28:37.040
This isn't one of your X-File theories, is it?

28:39.680 --> 28:43.880
lt doesn't matter what l think.
We're still after the same thing.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.720
- Mulder.
- FBl centrex operator. Please hold.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.440
- Yeah.
- Guess who, Ace.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.960
Willis?!

28:59.040 --> 29:01.360
That depends on who you ask, don't it?

29:02.280 --> 29:03.400
Where's Scully?

29:03.480 --> 29:05.800
You're the FBl!

29:05.880 --> 29:08.000
You figure it out!

29:08.080 --> 29:09.920
Let me talk to her.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.400
Yeah, sure.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.080
- Mulder...
- Dana, are you OK?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.800
- Don't...
- Dana?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.400
OK!

29:21.480 --> 29:23.880
That's it! Goodbye!

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
lt's not gonna work, Jack.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.720
You don't think so?

29:31.800 --> 29:35.360
Bureau policy prohibits
negotiating with kidnappers.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.080
But you already know that, don't you, Jack?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.160
Stop calling me that!

29:40.240 --> 29:44.760
Your name is Jack Willis.
You were born February 23rd, 1957.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.480
- You live at 51 Stanhope...
- My name is Warren James Dupre!

29:48.560 --> 29:53.400
And l was born in Clammouth Falls,
Oregon, in the Year of the Rat!

29:54.720 --> 29:57.520
We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.840
You taught me how to fish through the ice.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.360
lt was your parents' cabin.
Jack, try to remember.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.080
We drove up in a snowstorm.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.160
Come on, Jack!

30:17.200 --> 30:19.720
Don't think l didn't see what you did!

30:19.800 --> 30:24.000
l was like a little slip of paper,
up there on that hospital ceiling.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.160
- l saw everything.
- What did you see?

30:27.240 --> 30:31.080
You left me to die on that table,
while you tried to save your friend!

30:31.160 --> 30:34.160
- You are my friend!
- Too bad he was gone already.

30:34.920 --> 30:39.360
l watched him go. Just saw him slip away
down that long, black tunnel.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.720
No. We brought you back.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.920
You shot me dead!

30:46.200 --> 30:48.200
And then you let me die.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.760
No. You won't kill me, Jack.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.520
You call me that one more time,

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
and l'll make you stone cold.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.720
Easy, baby. Easy! Not yet.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.680
Remember, she's our ticket.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.760
Hey!

31:14.600 --> 31:18.160
- Got any more of this soda?
- You just drank the last of it.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.000
Soda...?

31:20.080 --> 31:22.080
How much of that have you had?

31:22.160 --> 31:25.760
- What's it to you?
- Jack Willis is diabetic.

31:25.840 --> 31:30.240
Which means that you are. Too much sugar
in the system could lead to hyperglycaemia.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.320
Maybe that's why
your stomach's hurting so bad.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.760
Abdominal pain is the first sign
of impending diabetic coma.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840
You need insulin.

31:51.440 --> 31:56.680
l feel myself getting into their heads,
and l'm scared by what l'm feeling.

31:56.760 --> 32:02.200
The intoxicating freedom that comes from
disconnecting action and consequence.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.720
Theirs is a world where
nothing matters but their own needs,

32:07.560 --> 32:09.800
their own impossible appetites.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.160
And while the pleasure they derive
from acts of violence is clearly sexual,

32:15.240 --> 32:20.760
it also speaks to what Warden Jackson
called their ''operatic devotion to each other''.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.120
lt's a love affair... l almost envy.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.080
Cadenceville PD just reported
a drugstore was broken into here,

32:34.160 --> 32:36.520
on the corner of
Old Forge Road and Madison.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.520
l'm betting that Scully is somewhere
within this five-mile radius.

32:40.600 --> 32:45.240
- Am l missing something?!
- 200 units of NPH insulin were taken.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.320
Willis is diabetic.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.600
Get me a census report. Let's see
how many households we're talking about.

32:55.680 --> 32:59.000
Quick, quick, quick!
My legs are starting to go numb!

32:59.080 --> 33:00.200
Hold on...

33:02.920 --> 33:05.360
- What the hell...?
- Drop the needle.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.520
- Without this medicine, he dies.
- Yeah! So you said.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.720
Now... put it down.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.440
Unless you want me
to put you down with it.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.160
What the hell are you doing?

33:21.360 --> 33:24.040
l need that medicine!

33:25.320 --> 33:28.840
- You still haven't figured it out, have you?
- Figured what out?

33:28.920 --> 33:30.960
lt wasn't my brother who set you up!

33:34.320 --> 33:36.320
You?!

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
Yeah... Me.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.680
How do you think l got away so clean?

33:43.760 --> 33:46.880
The minute you stepped into that bank,
l was out of there.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.000
l got the money and l got rid of you!

33:49.080 --> 33:51.080
At least, l thought l did.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.320
Tactical room. This is it!

34:07.840 --> 34:09.480
Mulder.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.159
- Listen carefully.
- Where's Willis?

34:12.239 --> 34:15.239
- Oh, he's here somewhere.
- Let me talk to Scully.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.159
Not this time.

34:17.239 --> 34:20.000
We don't deal unless we know Scully's alive.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.080
She's alive.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.199
She's not happy, but... she's alive.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.199
You listen to me. You lay one hand
on Scully, and so help me God...

34:29.280 --> 34:33.719
lf l were you, l'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

34:33.800 --> 34:38.080
Cos if you ever wanna see Scully again,
it's gonna cost you a million dollars.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.800
Have it by this time tomorrow.
l'll tell you when and where.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.679
We got it. lt's a 202 number.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.840
- Great!
- lt's coming through.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.960
- Here it is.
- Get the address.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.719
- Forget it.
- Why?

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
lt's Scully's cellular number.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.440
They're using her phone. We can't trace them.

35:09.920 --> 35:12.560
She's not happy, but... she's alive.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.920
lf l were you, l'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.920
- That last part?
- Yeah. Squelch the voice even more.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.200
Yeah.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.600
Done.

35:25.520 --> 35:29.680
lf l were you, l'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.080
Yep. Yep! There's something there.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.520
Definitely something at the high end.

35:36.320 --> 35:41.400
Let me throw on an extra Z-14 filter...
and isolate everything over half a decibel.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.160
lf l were you, l'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.520
There. That engine sound.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.920
Let's clean it up some more!

35:57.920 --> 36:01.760
lf l were you, l'd stop talking and...

36:01.840 --> 36:04.040
ls that a small plane?

36:05.160 --> 36:07.160
Taking off, by the sound of it.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.120
Give me a minute to guess
the altitude within 200ft!

36:10.200 --> 36:12.200
Great!

36:15.080 --> 36:19.400
All right, people! Settle down, grab a seat.
Mulder says he's got something.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.560
What? An alien virus, or new information
on the Kennedy assassination?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.640
Hey, Mulder's all right.

36:25.720 --> 36:29.720
Pay attention,
you might learn something from the man.

36:32.080 --> 36:36.400
From our last phone contact, we've identified
what sounds like light aircraft.

36:36.480 --> 36:41.360
Now, Washington County Regional Airport
happens to fall within our area.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.480
Since takeoffs are north to south,

36:43.560 --> 36:47.080
it's a fair bet that our target area
lies along this flight path.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.920
For those who remember math, that gives us
an area of three square miles to cover.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.320
Roughly 1,000 households.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.880
With 100 law enforcement officials,

36:57.960 --> 37:03.600
at about 30 households per man per hour,
we can canvass the entire area in three hours.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.040
Bruskin will grid the target area
and divide it among the teams.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.880
For those of you... who don't know
already, this one's important to me.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.880
So... let's do it right. Thanks.

37:16.600 --> 37:20.080
Let me see Steinberg, Calder, Westin,
Stipley and Mackowitz...

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
Scully?

37:29.240 --> 37:31.280
Was there snow?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
Yes... Jack.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.520
There was lots of snow.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.240
- l can't...
- lt was December.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.720
lt was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.920
l remember...

37:50.600 --> 37:52.600
a red stove.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.360
Yeah... That's right.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.080
There was a... There was a wood-burning
stove right in the middle of the room.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.640
Cold?

38:03.480 --> 38:05.480
- Yeah.
- So cold...

38:06.520 --> 38:10.120
l remember... l had to wrap you in a blanket

38:10.200 --> 38:12.720
when the wood ran out.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.520
Yeah.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.760
No... Jack! Don't close your eyes.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.480
Come on, keep talking.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.360
Jack, keep talking! Come on!

38:25.440 --> 38:28.040
Down on the floor, now!
Now, or you're dead!

38:28.120 --> 38:30.480
- l'm gonna execute every one of you!
- No!

38:31.200 --> 38:32.400
No!

38:33.880 --> 38:36.840
Shut up and do it!

38:48.200 --> 38:51.560
Just a second! Who is it?

38:51.640 --> 38:55.240
lt's Brother Tate. Could l speak with
you for just one moment, please?

38:56.680 --> 38:58.560
What do you want?

38:58.640 --> 39:02.600
Just a few minutes of your time, ma'am.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

39:02.680 --> 39:05.480
l wonder if l can interest you
in the word of the Lord?

39:05.560 --> 39:08.960
- Leather-bound, in black or red. Your choice.
- Go away!

39:14.280 --> 39:16.280
This is One Four. Target sighted.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.960
Well... l guess it's time to make that call.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.920
He's dead.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.840
lt's all on you now.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.920
He's dead because of you.

39:42.360 --> 39:44.360
Well...

39:44.440 --> 39:45.960
Guess it's over.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.880
Whoever you are.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.640
Don't move!

39:53.720 --> 39:55.720
- Jack!
- Shut up!

39:56.560 --> 39:58.640
l love you.

39:58.720 --> 40:00.160
Don't you know?

40:00.240 --> 40:02.960
You're why l came back.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.040
This is Westin.

40:12.120 --> 40:16.760
They've battened down the hatches. No clear
shot from this side. What about you guys?

40:18.280 --> 40:21.400
Ditto. Hold your positions
and keep radios at two.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.520
- How do we look?
- Backup's in.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.680
- But we still don't know what's going on.
- We will soon enough.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.320
l kept a bottle of medicine
in the other room. l'll go get it.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
What do you say, huh?

40:52.040 --> 40:54.040
l'll get it for you.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.120
Look! Look! Look!

40:56.200 --> 40:58.200
Look, l love you.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.280
- l love you, baby.
- No...

41:00.360 --> 41:02.880
Listen! Listen, we... we still have her.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.520
We can get away with this.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.240
l don't think so, baby. Not this time.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.080
Jack, put the gun down!

41:10.160 --> 41:13.920
You remember that... that
light that l talked about?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.440
- No...
- lt's beautiful.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.520
There's nothing to be afraid of.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.640
- No!
- FBl!

41:23.720 --> 41:24.920
Freeze!

41:25.000 --> 41:26.840
Jack!

41:26.920 --> 41:28.480
FBl!

41:33.240 --> 41:35.240
Scully. Are you OK?

41:36.440 --> 41:38.440
Jack?!

41:55.760 --> 42:00.240
Hi. l got this from the morgue,
along with the rest of his personal effects.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.400
l thought you might want it.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.480
''Happy 35th. Love D.''

42:06.600 --> 42:08.920
l got it for him three years ago.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.960
Next of kin?

42:13.040 --> 42:14.200
No.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.520
Jack was an only child.
His parents died when he was in college.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.680
There's a... kid over in Parklawn.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.960
Jack's been his big brother,
so l'm going to go and see him tomorrow.

42:26.080 --> 42:29.480
- What am l gonna tell him?
- The official story.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.560
Which is?

42:31.640 --> 42:34.880
Fugitive Lula Phillips died in
a shoot-out with federal agents.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.280
lt also resulted in the death of Special Agent
Jack Willis - killed in the line of duty.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.120
What am l supposed to tell myself?

42:51.360 --> 42:53.120
Good night.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.320
lt's not working. lt stopped.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.120
At 6.47.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.040
The exact time that Jack
went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.880
What does that mean?

43:08.960 --> 43:10.960
lt means...

43:13.200 --> 43:15.520
lt means whatever you want it to mean.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.600
Good night.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.160
