I can get your shoulders.

03:27.689 --> 03:29.656

Excel, PowerPoint, Lotus Notes.

Oh. Oh, sorry. Shit.

07:31.234 --> 07:32.967
I'm sorry.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.068
Oh, my God,
this is so embarrassing.

07:35.070 --> 07:36.436
You can just leave it...

07:36.438 --> 07:39.172
No, I... no, no, no. I'm
not going to leave it.

07:41.411 --> 07:43.010
Sorry.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.407

You have a good day.

09:33.789 --> 09:36.358
I will, I will.
I know. I will.

09:43.432 --> 09:45.202
Okay, here you go.

09:50.206 --> 09:52.973
Oh. I can't
do this every day.

09:52.975 --> 09:56.213
- Okay?
- I did it. It's done.

09:58.481 --> 10:01.250
Okay. Okay, better.

10:16.531 --> 10:17.967
Thank you, Mommy.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.141
You want
some more water?

10:27.143 --> 10:29.310

10:29.312 --> 10:31.882
Schnapps.

A little bit.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.889

- Okay.

10:46.495 --> 10:47.864
Okay?

10:52.934 --> 10:54.003
Okay.

10:57.606 --> 11:00.577
Ooh. Oh.

11:04.079 --> 11:06.849
Ooh. That was
a long walk.

11:18.394 --> 11:19.560
Oh...

11:19.562 --> 11:23.330
Come on, come on. Aaah.

11:23.332 --> 11:24.301
There.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.911
Wow, this skirt
is so tight.

11:36.913 --> 11:39.216
To you. To you.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.003
You want some?

12:03.005 --> 12:04.305
Okay.

12:08.110 --> 12:09.613
You're
such a brat.

12:12.081 --> 12:16.483
Okay. Put your mask on now
for a little bit, okay?

12:16.485 --> 12:19.188
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

12:20.555 --> 12:21.924
I'm okay.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.060
Okay.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.365
- Just rest.
- Just take a nap.

12:51.252 --> 12:53.253
I love you.

12:53.255 --> 12:54.991
I love you, Mommy.

13:52.548 --> 13:54.148
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.349
How's your day going?

13:55.351 --> 13:56.816
Oh, pretty good.
And yours?

13:56.818 --> 13:58.354
Not too bad.

14:03.391 --> 14:05.124
Are you sleeping?

14:30.318 --> 14:31.487
Mommy?

16:32.942 --> 16:34.210
Ready?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.348

One, two...

17:08.643 --> 17:10.512
Hi. Oh.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.001
Kyra.

18:41.003 --> 18:42.338
Hey.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.073
Thank you
for coming.

18:47.075 --> 18:48.507
I'm gonna
miss her.

18:48.509 --> 18:50.644
Yeah. You were
so good to her.

18:50.646 --> 18:53.612
- Oh, she was good to me.
- Yeah.

18:53.614 --> 18:55.415
Can I get you a drink
of water or something?

18:55.417 --> 18:56.750
No, no, I'm good.
Thank you.

18:56.752 --> 18:57.687
Sure.

19:05.994 --> 19:07.863
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:16.871 --> 19:18.341
Thank you for coming.

19:20.109 --> 19:21.675
She was
a good woman.

19:21.677 --> 19:25.515
Yeah.
She really loved you.

19:26.849 --> 19:27.784
Yeah.

19:31.786 --> 19:34.687
- How are you and Becky?
- Uh, fine.

19:34.689 --> 19:38.492
- Finally got something, so...
- Oh, really? Construction?

19:38.494 --> 19:40.396
- Yeah.
- Great.

19:40.996 --> 19:42.995
Yeah.

19:42.997 --> 19:44.933
Money's still tight,
but, uh...

19:48.570 --> 19:49.806
How about you?

19:51.806 --> 19:53.842
I'm up for a
couple of things.

19:57.646 --> 19:58.581
Yeah.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.516
I should, uh...

20:03.518 --> 20:05.718
It's a long drive
back, so...

20:05.720 --> 20:06.953
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.591
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

23:13.140 --> 23:16.642
<i>How long will it take to fix?</i>

23:16.644 --> 23:19.946
<i>Uh, five, six
weeks for the new certificate.</i>

23:19.948 --> 23:24.786
<i>Make the check out for $40,
plus $15 for each copy.</i>

23:25.754 --> 23:27.821
<i>Money orders are also good.</i>

23:27.823 --> 23:30.692
Okay, uh, I'll get back to you.
Thank you so much.

23:40.034 --> 23:43.269
- How can I help you today?
- I'd like to cash this, please.

23:43.271 --> 23:44.704
Your ID, please?

23:48.377 --> 23:49.645
Thank you.

23:54.983 --> 23:57.016
Who's Ruth?

23:57.018 --> 23:58.818
That's my mother.

23:58.820 --> 24:00.823
Only she can cash
her own check.

24:04.292 --> 24:05.925
But, um...

24:05.927 --> 24:08.895
Or she can fill out forms
giving you power of attorney...

24:08.897 --> 24:12.368
She's very old and she's failing
and she's not doing well, so...

24:14.136 --> 24:17.073
Well, all you need are two
witnesses and her signature.

24:21.176 --> 24:22.341
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

24:22.343 --> 24:23.845
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:49.137 --> 24:50.239
Yeah.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.108
What are you doing with
Reny and Steve and Martin?

24:59.980 --> 25:02.017
I keep asking
myself the same question.

25:14.228 --> 25:15.730
What can I get ya?

25:16.965 --> 25:18.234
A rum and coke.

25:38.285 --> 25:40.355
- Seven dollars, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

25:52.033 --> 25:54.003
Uh, it's declined.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.071
Are you sure?

25:58.073 --> 25:59.275
Yeah.

26:43.418 --> 26:44.486
Thanks.

27:01.303 --> 27:02.838
Hey.

27:04.371 --> 27:06.138
I knew it was you.

27:06.140 --> 27:08.374
Nice to see you outside
of the mail room.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.444
Usually around 3:00,
sometimes with your mom.

27:11.446 --> 27:12.848
Name is Doug.

27:14.448 --> 27:15.884
And you are?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.119
Kyra.

27:20.121 --> 27:22.955
Kyra,
nice to meet you.

27:22.957 --> 27:24.125
That's pretty.

27:26.428 --> 27:28.528
So, how long
have you lived...

27:28.530 --> 27:29.932
At Parkside?

27:31.498 --> 27:34.533
Unless you want to tell
me how old you are.

27:34.535 --> 27:35.904
Ten months.

27:38.505 --> 27:40.039
You?

27:40.041 --> 27:41.277
Twelve years.

27:43.044 --> 27:44.343
And what,
before ten months?

27:44.345 --> 27:45.511
Hmm?

27:45.513 --> 27:47.416
Before ten months,
you were...

27:53.420 --> 27:54.923
Sorry,
I was just...

27:58.459 --> 28:00.129
I didn't mean
to bother you.

28:08.570 --> 28:10.306
I was living in Virginia.

28:14.542 --> 28:15.942
Virginia?

28:15.944 --> 28:18.244
- Yeah, I was married.
- Ah.

28:18.246 --> 28:19.348
Working.

28:21.248 --> 28:22.447
And now?

28:22.449 --> 28:24.250
Not working.
Not married.

28:24.252 --> 28:28.454
I've been looking
though... for a job.

28:37.532 --> 28:38.601
You?

28:39.700 --> 28:41.434
I'm sorry?

28:41.436 --> 28:43.569
Do you work?

28:43.571 --> 28:45.671
As much as I can.

28:45.673 --> 28:49.007
Mainly drive people back and
forth from the airport.

28:49.009 --> 28:51.610
Trying to save up.
Thank you.

28:51.612 --> 28:55.447
Get my medallion,
be my own boss.

28:55.449 --> 28:58.318
What's
a medallion?

29:00.522 --> 29:05.324
It proves to the state that you have a
license to own and operate your own cab.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.262
I was being sarcastic. They cost about
a million bucks. Never gonna happen.

29:09.264 --> 29:12.501
So I part-time at the nursing
home, a couple other things.

29:14.034 --> 29:15.504
Learning a mean game
of Bingo though.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.415
I think it's really nice the
way you take care of your mom.

29:39.226 --> 29:40.396
She's dead.

29:49.403 --> 29:50.672
I'm really sorry.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.242
Well...

29:56.143 --> 29:59.044
that's what old
people do, they die.

29:59.046 --> 30:00.248
I guess so.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.091
You want to
get really drunk tonight?

30:15.362 --> 30:16.431
Come on.

30:18.699 --> 30:20.436
First one hurts.

30:24.238 --> 30:25.772
Oh, that's bad.

30:25.774 --> 30:27.176
Impressive.

30:28.142 --> 30:30.510
- Mia!
- Yeah.

30:30.512 --> 30:32.544
Wow!

30:32.546 --> 30:34.283
Give us two Jamesons.

31:43.284 --> 31:45.653
<i>6195.</i>

31:47.822 --> 31:49.792
<i>And the phone number?</i>

31:55.662 --> 31:57.131
Are you done?

32:00.735 --> 32:02.201
Are you available weekends?

32:02.203 --> 32:03.503
Yes.

32:03.505 --> 32:04.503
It's minimum.

32:04.505 --> 32:05.705
No, that's okay.

32:05.707 --> 32:07.907
Plus any
tips that you make.

32:07.909 --> 32:09.178
That's great.

32:15.283 --> 32:16.715
Henry will
give you a call.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.388
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

32:55.355 --> 32:58.493
<i>Mailbox one, no message.</i>

32:59.694 --> 33:02.865
<i>Mailbox two,
no message.</i>

33:04.631 --> 33:07.867
<i>Mailbox three,
no message.</i>

33:07.869 --> 33:10.805
<i>Mailbox four,
no message.</i>

33:28.555 --> 33:30.491
- <i>The number you...</i>
- Shit!

33:32.226 --> 33:33.562
Are you kidding me?

33:41.436 --> 33:42.371
Fuck.

34:09.996 --> 34:11.963
- Hello.
- Hello? Hi.

34:11.965 --> 34:13.599
Hey, is there
a lady here,

34:13.601 --> 34:16.434
I think she's the wife
of the owner, and she's...

34:16.436 --> 34:19.571
Oh, hi! Hi, I just thought I'd
come by and check on the job.

34:19.572 --> 34:21.340
- Kyra, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:21.342 --> 34:23.574
Listen, I tried to
call you yesterday.

34:23.577 --> 34:25.811
I know.
My phone broke.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.349
Oh, that's
a shame, um...

34:28.815 --> 34:33.686
Look, my husband hired
somebody without telling me.

34:33.688 --> 34:35.356
And I'm-I'm
really sorry.

34:38.891 --> 34:41.025
Look, if anything else comes up,

34:41.027 --> 34:42.726
I will call you
right away.

34:42.728 --> 34:43.963
- Okay.
- All right?

37:31.164 --> 37:33.231
It just... It just...

37:33.233 --> 37:35.200
You just have to
kind of jiggle it.

37:35.202 --> 37:36.968
- Okay.
- Just needs a little more oil.

37:36.970 --> 37:41.142
- Yeah.
- It's from the 1950s, so...

37:44.611 --> 37:46.611
That's okay.

37:46.613 --> 37:48.516
And, um, I have, uh...

37:49.816 --> 37:54.086
I have a few more
things in here that...

37:54.088 --> 37:56.024
I don't know,
you might be interested in.

37:59.827 --> 38:01.861
Everything, or...

38:01.863 --> 38:03.198
Yeah, pretty much.

38:26.753 --> 38:28.620
- Yeah.
- Hi.

38:28.622 --> 38:32.157
Um, I'm Kyra Johnson. I was just...
I was just, um...

38:32.159 --> 38:36.128
um, wondering if the part-time
filing position was still open?

38:36.130 --> 38:39.097
- Uh, no, that's been filled.
- Okay.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.300
If you want, you can leave your
information and phone number.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.801
I could get back to you
if anything comes up.

38:43.803 --> 38:46.704
Um... would it
be all right

38:46.706 --> 38:50.008
if I just checked back in
with you periodically?

38:50.010 --> 38:51.309
- Sure.
- Okay.

38:51.311 --> 38:53.714
Thank you so much. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.584
Where you been hiding?

39:31.586 --> 39:35.122
Oh,
been around... busy.

39:36.222 --> 39:38.256
You like it?

39:38.258 --> 39:41.292
No, I don't.

39:41.294 --> 39:43.762
- Well, at least I didn't pay for it. I traded.
- Uh-huh.

39:43.764 --> 39:45.965
Trust me, the ski
hat looked dumber.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.166
Thank you.

39:47.168 --> 39:49.702
How are you?
You all right?

39:49.704 --> 39:52.874
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm okay. You?

39:54.307 --> 39:56.844
I was looking down
at the bar for you.

39:57.711 --> 39:59.878
Oh, um, no, it's...

39:59.880 --> 40:02.648
I don't usually
go to bars. I...

40:02.650 --> 40:04.753
No, I-I understand,
yeah.

40:09.823 --> 40:11.659
Thanks for the beer.
That's...

40:13.827 --> 40:16.128
I just want to know
if I did something wrong.

40:16.130 --> 40:18.930
Oh, God, no. No.

40:18.932 --> 40:20.034
Okay.

40:21.901 --> 40:24.370
- Are you selling stuff? Are you...
- Uh...

40:24.372 --> 40:26.207
No? You're
just shopping?

40:27.707 --> 40:31.242
I hang out with the neighbors.

40:31.244 --> 40:32.947
It's really good
to see you. Hey.

40:37.418 --> 40:39.952
So how about you? Are
you selling your stuff?

40:39.954 --> 40:42.090
Uh, no,
not really.

40:43.157 --> 40:45.724
I sold, uh, well...

40:45.726 --> 40:47.695
- Oh, really not really.
- Not really, no.

40:51.731 --> 40:54.001
I guess I should have met
my neighbors earlier.

40:59.072 --> 41:00.808
Oh...

41:03.443 --> 41:05.679
I'm really glad
you moved in.

41:09.983 --> 41:10.918
Yeah?

41:14.088 --> 41:17.088
Yeah. I mean, I'm not glad about
everything you went through,

41:17.090 --> 41:19.827
but, yeah,
I'm glad you moved in.

41:21.996 --> 41:23.097
Me too.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.970
I'm real glad I got away
from all that craziness.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.937
Wow.

41:31.939 --> 41:33.838
What do you mean,
like losing your job?

41:33.840 --> 41:36.841
Just...

41:36.843 --> 41:40.280
Everything else
I thought I had.

41:44.918 --> 41:46.720
I mean, you know
what it's like.

41:51.726 --> 41:55.093
Nothing you worked for
is working...

41:55.095 --> 42:00.899
and you think...

42:00.901 --> 42:04.039
everyone has just
given up on you.

42:06.439 --> 42:11.146
And... and you just
get so down and...

42:16.015 --> 42:18.887
Thank God for my mom.
She saved my ass.

42:26.260 --> 42:27.492
Yeah.

42:27.494 --> 42:29.730
Are you gonna help me
pack up all this shit?

42:31.898 --> 42:33.000
Yeah.

42:34.135 --> 42:35.770
- So, come...
- Of course I am.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.173
Come on.

43:57.852 --> 44:00.586
Oh! You're so...
It's hurting me!

44:00.588 --> 44:02.290
You're stronger
than I thought.

44:21.642 --> 44:23.410
Next customer, please?

44:31.952 --> 44:33.921
Hello. What can I
do for you today?

44:37.157 --> 44:40.428
Cashing a check? Can I
see some ID, please?

44:49.235 --> 44:50.304
Thank you.

45:08.555 --> 45:09.591
Here you go.

45:18.064 --> 45:19.333
Have a nice day.

46:32.506 --> 46:34.142
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.311
Mmm.

46:37.744 --> 46:40.080
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

46:41.148 --> 46:43.782
How was your day?

46:43.784 --> 46:48.186
Uh... I handed out
flyers for no money,

46:48.188 --> 46:50.789
and, uh, I just
did some errands,

46:50.791 --> 46:53.225
and straightened up some stuff
in the apartment. Thanks.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.363
- Thanks, Mia.
- Hey, can you bring some french fries?

46:57.497 --> 46:59.564
And how
was your day?

46:59.566 --> 47:01.636
My day's like
every other day.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.037
I'm grinding.

47:05.039 --> 47:07.638
The second shift
was better than the first.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.276
Last couple of hours
were all right.

47:11.244 --> 47:12.579
Weirdest thing happened
though.

47:14.381 --> 47:17.215
I saw a woman today who looked
exactly like your mother.

47:17.217 --> 47:18.783
I mean, she even
walked like her.

47:18.785 --> 47:21.352
She walked right in
front of my car.

47:21.354 --> 47:23.190
It kind of
freaked me out.

47:31.664 --> 47:32.766
I...

47:35.269 --> 47:37.635
I know. Everywhere
I go, I see her.

47:37.637 --> 47:42.207
She... I mean,
she's always in my mind.

47:42.209 --> 47:44.776
Mmm, of course, she is.
I mean, I-I understand that.

47:44.778 --> 47:47.749
But, I mean,
this was an actual person.

47:51.452 --> 47:55.122
You wouldn't have believed it. I mean,
she looked exactly like your mom.

47:56.823 --> 48:00.124
Do we have to talk
about this... now?

48:00.126 --> 48:04.361
No. Hey, hey. Come here, come here.
I'm sorry.

48:04.363 --> 48:05.830
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

48:05.832 --> 48:07.432
- No, it's okay.
- You all right?

48:07.434 --> 48:09.834
Yeah, no, I'm just...
I'm exhausted.

48:09.836 --> 48:13.240
I just had... Oh, God,
it's just such a long day.

48:17.244 --> 48:20.178
You want to get out of here
and just go back to my place?

48:21.747 --> 48:25.117
- I-I'm just so tired, you know? I'm just...
- Okay.

48:25.119 --> 48:26.852
- And I have such an early day tomorrow.
- Hey, all right.

48:26.854 --> 48:29.189
I get it, I get it,
I get it. Yeah.

48:58.285 --> 48:59.287
Hi.

49:15.269 --> 49:16.337
Thank you.

49:21.207 --> 49:22.340
Um...

49:22.342 --> 49:24.244
It's for your taxes.

49:29.550 --> 49:32.350
So, no payment?

49:32.352 --> 49:34.818
Um, it's a donation,
for the homeless.

49:34.820 --> 49:36.323
Oh, okay.

50:29.476 --> 50:31.311
I got
a daughter out west.

50:33.847 --> 50:36.548
Probably wouldn't even
recognize her.

50:36.550 --> 50:41.586
She doesn't know me either, except
she thinks I'm a monumental fuckup.

50:41.588 --> 50:43.854
- You're not a fuckup.
- It's not that.

50:43.856 --> 50:46.358
It's just how
her mom sees me.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.459
Doesn't matter that
I've paid everything back

50:48.461 --> 50:50.428
or that I'm paying
every month

50:50.430 --> 50:53.965
or how many times I've said sorry
for all the lying and bullshit

50:53.967 --> 50:56.334
and fucking up
everyone's lives.

50:56.336 --> 50:59.336
It's just how
she sees me, okay?

50:59.338 --> 51:00.574
But...

51:17.356 --> 51:18.525
Hey.

51:37.811 --> 51:40.445
Oh, God,
you look beautiful.

52:21.755 --> 52:23.887
- Hey, Gary.
- How you holding up, Kyra?

52:23.889 --> 52:25.392
Okay. Thanks.

52:51.517 --> 52:52.653
No.

53:08.034 --> 53:09.369
Fuck.

53:14.907 --> 53:16.476
Shit!

53:23.182 --> 53:24.117
Kyra?

54:14.700 --> 54:16.667
...Flatbush Avenue yesterday.

54:16.669 --> 54:18.202
You gotta
fill out a form.

54:18.204 --> 54:19.739
It was to the...

54:25.579 --> 54:27.912
Okay, all right.
I'll just fill this out.

54:27.914 --> 54:29.749
- You need a pen?
- No, got it. Thank you.

55:16.262 --> 55:18.195
- Is this the lost and found?
- Yes, ma'am.

55:18.197 --> 55:20.198
Did anyone turn in a wallet?

55:29.543 --> 55:31.709
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

55:31.711 --> 55:34.077
Yeah, because I-I-I...
I lost it yesterday,

55:34.079 --> 55:37.215
and so it would have been turned
in either today or yesterday.

55:37.217 --> 55:39.584
I'm sorry, ma'am. Fill
out this form, please.

55:39.586 --> 55:41.619
Is this the only place
where people turn things in?

55:41.621 --> 55:43.620
This is the only place.
Fill out that form.

55:43.622 --> 55:46.057
- If we find it, we'll get in touch with you.
- All right. Thank you.

55:46.059 --> 55:47.127
You're welcome.

56:07.314 --> 56:09.713
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you see my wallet?

56:09.715 --> 56:13.584
- Last night, did you... did you see it?
- No, you didn't take it out.

56:13.586 --> 56:16.220
It's gone. I've looked everywhere. I
don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.

56:16.222 --> 56:19.990
Okay, shh. It's all right, okay?
Just don't... Here.

56:19.992 --> 56:22.026
No. No, no,
I'm not gonna take that.

56:22.028 --> 56:24.695
- It's fine, trust me.
- No, no.

56:24.697 --> 56:28.166
It's gonna turn up.
It's just for now, okay?

56:28.168 --> 56:31.736
- You need this just as much as I do.
- I'm gonna be fine.

56:31.738 --> 56:34.275
Hey. It's all right.

56:36.242 --> 56:38.278
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

56:39.713 --> 56:41.713
I'm paying you back,
I swear.

56:41.715 --> 56:43.316
I'll see you as soon
as I finish work.

56:52.992 --> 56:55.895
Sorry about that.
Okay.

57:39.104 --> 57:41.138
Am I gonna see you later?

57:41.140 --> 57:42.340
Don't go. Yeah.

57:42.342 --> 57:44.307
I've got to.

57:50.983 --> 57:53.219
- Good luck today.
- Mm-hmm.

58:04.064 --> 58:07.401
<i>Number 58, come
to Window 3 for ID photo.</i>

58:12.204 --> 58:14.374
<i>Mrs. Ramirez,
please pick up 71.</i>

58:22.849 --> 58:27.121
<i>Floor supervisor, Window 7.
Window 7, supervisor.</i>

58:31.023 --> 58:33.758
<i>Mr. Corelli,
vehicle inspection.</i>

58:33.760 --> 58:36.760
<i>Mr. Corelli,
vehicle inspection.</i>

58:36.762 --> 58:39.296
Ma'am, you can't wear
those glasses for the photo.

58:39.298 --> 58:43.166
The light,
it hurts my eyes.

58:43.168 --> 58:46.873
Yeah, we need to be able to see your face.
Hat's gotta go too.

58:50.876 --> 58:54.881
<i>Mrs. Garcia, Window 11.
Mrs. Garcia, Window 11.</i>

58:59.985 --> 59:01.020
Ready?

59:14.099 --> 59:15.768
<i>Thing went dead on me here.</i>

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:16.963
I'm in here.

01:00:31.276 --> 01:00:32.845
I'm in here!

01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:28.167
You want to tell me why you
were dressing like your mother?

01:01:29.434 --> 01:01:31.269
I needed to cash
her checks.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.637
What checks?

01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:35.205
Her pension checks.

01:01:35.207 --> 01:01:36.908
- Jesus Christ.
- I...

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.242
I-I-I-I wrote down
the wrong...

01:01:39.244 --> 01:01:42.445
on her, um, her death certificate,
the-the social security.

01:01:42.447 --> 01:01:47.050
And I wanted to change it,
but it costs so much,

01:01:47.052 --> 01:01:50.687
and-and the check...
the...

01:01:50.689 --> 01:01:53.291
The checks just kept coming
and nothing else was,

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:57.093
and you know how hard I've been looking,
and I just... I had no other choice.

01:01:57.095 --> 01:01:58.461
She's fucking dead,
Kyra!

01:01:58.463 --> 01:02:00.398
I know that!
Don't you think I know that?

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.332
I deal with that every day!

01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:04.702
Do you have any idea what'll
happen if they catch you?

01:02:04.704 --> 01:02:07.238
You're stealing, committing fraud.
They will fucking put you away.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.573
- Are you nuts?
- Fuck you. I would never steal from my mother.

01:02:09.575 --> 01:02:12.913
- But you did!
- Only until I got something!

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.414
This is what
you came up with?

01:02:20.586 --> 01:02:23.490
Doug... please.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.293
I didn't know what else to do.

01:02:30.195 --> 01:02:31.497
Come on. You know me.

01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:37.236
I don't think I do.

01:02:39.472 --> 01:02:40.974
Of course you do.

01:02:43.709 --> 01:02:45.311
I ca-can't do this.

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.749
- I-I just...
- You can't do what?

01:02:52.751 --> 01:02:55.318
This. This.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.421
I promised myself that if
I got my life back together again,

01:02:58.423 --> 01:03:01.661
I would not fuck it up with lying
or bullshit or... Ju...

01:03:06.164 --> 01:03:07.668
I can't.

01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:12.406
I'm sorry, but I can...
I can't do this.

01:03:15.407 --> 01:03:18.044
Okay.

01:04:00.787 --> 01:04:02.686
The truck
was late again.

01:04:02.688 --> 01:04:05.356
You tell me every week, "Tuesday,
it's gonna be on time."

01:04:05.358 --> 01:04:08.725
It's not on time, I'm telling you. You
gotta chop these a little bit tighter.

01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:11.562
Hey, Jimmy, I'll call you right back, okay?
Hi. Can I help you?

01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:14.597
Yeah, I'm about... I'm here
about the bookkeeping position.

01:04:14.599 --> 01:04:18.501
Ah, it's been filled.
Uh, that's too bad.

01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:20.039
Okay. Thank you.

01:04:26.244 --> 01:04:27.613
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:04:30.749 --> 01:04:32.585
You ready?

01:05:33.211 --> 01:05:34.213
Hey.

01:05:36.314 --> 01:05:37.851
Half of what I owe you.

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.425
You want to come in
for a drink?

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.401
Hi.

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:21.727
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:06:30.468 --> 01:06:31.771
You gotta stop that.

01:06:41.514 --> 01:06:42.979
Done.

01:06:49.722 --> 01:06:50.790
With everything.

01:06:54.392 --> 01:06:57.630
I swear, I'm not gonna do that anymore.
I don't care what I have to do.

01:06:59.664 --> 01:07:01.634
Okay.

01:07:04.236 --> 01:07:05.505
Did you sleep well?

01:07:06.805 --> 01:07:07.773
Great.

01:07:13.579 --> 01:07:17.881
Hey, can you check with the nursing home
again today, see if there's anything?

01:07:17.883 --> 01:07:21.655
Of course. You never know
when something will open up.

01:07:25.657 --> 01:07:28.227
Will you wake me up in a half
an hour before my shift?

01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:30.593
Sure.

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.706
No.

01:08:16.608 --> 01:08:17.611
No.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:19.979
Gary.

01:08:21.379 --> 01:08:23.349
Gary, I'm gonna get you
the money. I...

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:26.582
I just need
a little more time.

01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:28.484
It's been four months.

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:31.055
It ain't me, Kyra.
It's management.

01:08:31.057 --> 01:08:33.460
All right. Tell them I'll
get it to them next week.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:37.997
Will you at least
do that for me? Please?

01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:08.792
- We'll figure this out.
- When? After I'm evicted?

01:09:08.794 --> 01:09:11.962
- I didn't...
- No, I can't lose this apartment.

01:09:11.964 --> 01:09:14.832
- Kyra, I just want to help.
- And you know what? You don't need this.

01:09:14.834 --> 01:09:16.536
I just want to help.

01:09:17.603 --> 01:09:18.705
You can't.

01:09:22.674 --> 01:09:25.376
There's gotta be something you can sell.
Didn't your mom have any jewelry?

01:09:25.377 --> 01:09:27.781
No, it's just...
It's costume. It's crap.

01:09:36.522 --> 01:09:38.555
Here.

01:09:38.557 --> 01:09:40.390
- Take it back.
- No.

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:44.560
- I don't need it.
- No. It's not gonna put a fucking dent in what I owe!

01:09:44.562 --> 01:09:47.830
I am in over my fucking
head with this shit!

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:49.432
Don't you get that?

01:09:49.434 --> 01:09:51.769
Yeah, I get it.
Kyra, calm down.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.407
No, you try calming
the fuck down with this!

01:10:01.013 --> 01:10:02.482
Hey.

01:10:11.557 --> 01:10:13.824
They're not gonna kick you out tomorrow.

01:10:13.826 --> 01:10:15.128
Do you understand?

01:10:17.696 --> 01:10:19.966
Y-You've got time.
Okay?

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:23.969
You've got time.

01:11:06.644 --> 01:11:07.880
Kyra, it's me!

01:12:08.674 --> 01:12:09.907
Oh, Becky.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:10.943
Kyra.

01:12:12.978 --> 01:12:14.848
I hope
I didn't startle you.

01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:21.685
Would it be all right
if I came in?

01:12:21.687 --> 01:12:23.153
Sure. Of-Of course.

01:12:23.155 --> 01:12:24.256
Thanks.

01:12:31.162 --> 01:12:32.232
Thank you.

01:12:33.732 --> 01:12:35.766
- Can I take your coat?
- Oh, no, I'm good.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.570
- I'm a little chilled, actually.
- Oh.

01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:43.340
When are you due?

01:12:43.342 --> 01:12:44.841
Six weeks.

01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:46.243
- That's soon.
- Yeah.

01:12:46.245 --> 01:12:47.580
Yeah.

01:12:50.249 --> 01:12:51.882
- Are you hungry?
- No.

01:12:51.884 --> 01:12:53.887
- I could whip up a sandwich.
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:13:14.939 --> 01:13:17.110
Oh, excuse me.

01:13:21.914 --> 01:13:24.080
- Your ex-wife is here.
- How long has she been here?

01:13:24.082 --> 01:13:26.149
Just a couple minutes.

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:28.185
I don't know.
I don't know why she's here.

01:13:28.187 --> 01:13:30.988
Okay.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.189
- Kyra.
- Hi.

01:13:32.191 --> 01:13:33.957
Hey.

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:36.793
I-I hope it's okay.
I didn't mean just to show.

01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:39.096
Did-Did you get
my message this morning?

01:13:39.098 --> 01:13:41.832
- Uh, I've been working.
- Oh. Yeah.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.135
I'll give you a minute.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.074
You're pregnant.

01:13:51.076 --> 01:13:52.178
Yeah.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.717
Place looks good. You repainted.

01:13:59.785 --> 01:14:00.787
Thanks.

01:14:02.854 --> 01:14:04.387
What are you doing here?

01:14:09.394 --> 01:14:11.798
I didn't know...

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.800
I didn't know where else to go.

01:14:17.335 --> 01:14:19.671
I can't find anything. I...

01:14:20.839 --> 01:14:22.972
Thought you were up
for a few things.

01:14:22.974 --> 01:14:24.740
I thought so too, and...

01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:27.746
It's just hard out there right...
Especially...

01:14:29.013 --> 01:14:31.347
I'm no spring chicken.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.855
I mean, you know how hard I've
worked, and it wasn't my fault that,

01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:41.358
you know,
they downsized me out of a job.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.993
That was
two years ago.

01:14:43.995 --> 01:14:47.099
And ever since then,
I have been looking every day.

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.970
I... I don't even know how many...

01:14:53.138 --> 01:14:55.408
how many resumes
I've dropped off.

01:14:56.775 --> 01:14:58.411
There are other jobs,
you know?

01:14:59.844 --> 01:15:01.013
I know that.

01:15:02.147 --> 01:15:03.649
I have tried everything...

01:15:07.719 --> 01:15:11.390
and am reduced to handing out
flyers on parked cars.

01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:18.697
And praying every day
that I even have that.

01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:25.836
What?
Just say it.

01:15:25.838 --> 01:15:26.872
I...

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.709
I just...

01:15:33.245 --> 01:15:35.345
I was ju...

01:15:35.347 --> 01:15:37.748
I...

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:41.918
I just want to see
if you would loan me some cash.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.453
Just not a lot.
Just something until so...

01:15:44.455 --> 01:15:46.523
until I get something.

01:15:46.525 --> 01:15:49.191
I don't really have extra.

01:15:49.193 --> 01:15:51.763
Um, you know,
especially with the kid comin'.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.903
I'm not asking for a lot.

01:16:01.506 --> 01:16:03.974
I'm really happy
for you, Carl. I am.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:05.044
I really am.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.914
You're gonna make a great dad.

01:16:10.115 --> 01:16:11.217
But...

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.059
I wouldn't be asking
if I didn't have to.

01:16:23.461 --> 01:16:24.964
I'll pay you back.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.300
I swear to God.

01:16:33.004 --> 01:16:34.538
Thank you.

01:16:39.911 --> 01:16:42.378
Don't thank me yet.
It's about all I have.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.482
Thank you.

01:16:58.964 --> 01:16:59.966
Thank you.

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:08.504
Safe travels.

01:17:08.506 --> 01:17:10.273
Thank you
for the coffee.

01:17:10.275 --> 01:17:13.379
Okay. All right, just get back to me.
Thanks.

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:27.891
Thank you.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.592
So same time
tomorrow?

01:17:29.594 --> 01:17:31.129
We're covered
for tomorrow.

01:18:03.327 --> 01:18:04.429
Ruth.

01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:13.172
How you feelin' today?

01:18:17.409 --> 01:18:18.477
Looking good.

01:18:22.246 --> 01:18:23.448
It's Scott.

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:26.586
Let me help you.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:19.598
Yes?

01:20:21.265 --> 01:20:22.335
Ruth Woods?

01:20:24.536 --> 01:20:25.802
This Ruth?

01:20:30.241 --> 01:20:31.610
We have her wallet.

01:20:33.612 --> 01:20:34.714
Oh.

01:20:37.314 --> 01:20:38.584
Um, just a minute.

01:20:56.567 --> 01:20:57.801
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:57.803 --> 01:21:00.235
She's not here.
But I can give it to her.

01:21:00.237 --> 01:21:03.342
- I'm-I'm her daughter.
- We need to give this directly to her.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.146
- Procedure.
- Yes. Of course.

01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:10.646
Uh, when is she
expected back?

01:21:10.648 --> 01:21:11.784
Uh, later.

01:21:14.085 --> 01:21:15.784
We'll be back.

01:21:15.786 --> 01:21:19.455
I'm-I'm just not sure...

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:21.591
Uh-huh.

01:21:21.593 --> 01:21:24.828
- Not sure?
- Uh, I don't know when, uh, you know,

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:27.230
what time, so...

01:21:27.232 --> 01:21:29.731
No problem. We'll stop
by tomorrow morning.

01:21:29.733 --> 01:21:31.467
- Oh! Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:32.637
- Thank you.
- Bye.

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.374
- Yes, can I help you?
- Hey. How you doin', man?

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:48.313
Detective Brennan,
NYPD. And you are?

01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:58.280
What?

01:23:58.282 --> 01:24:00.717
- I'm sorry.
- You did what?

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:02.517
I panicked.

01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:04.354
I can't believe it.

01:24:04.356 --> 01:24:07.556
What the fuck!
You promised me!

01:24:07.558 --> 01:24:09.025
I know, I know,
I know. I didn't...

01:24:09.027 --> 01:24:11.927
You know what kind
of debt I'm in.

01:24:11.929 --> 01:24:13.665
Doug, I just...

01:24:16.334 --> 01:24:18.501
You know, I just...

01:24:18.503 --> 01:24:21.270
- I should stay the fuck away from here and disappear.
- And go where? With what?

01:24:21.272 --> 01:24:22.307
I don't know.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:28.947
Unbelievable.

01:24:32.717 --> 01:24:35.687
Fuck.

01:24:51.803 --> 01:24:54.636
Maybe I could hide out in your
place for a couple of days.

01:24:54.638 --> 01:24:56.773
What good do you think that'll do?
They'll keep coming back.

01:24:56.775 --> 01:24:58.876
- Fuck, they'll wait out there for you!
- Her.

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.819
Kyra?

01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:10.990
Kyra, look at me.

01:25:13.892 --> 01:25:16.592
- You're gonna have to just do this.
- No.

01:25:16.594 --> 01:25:18.731
- Get it over with. Deal with it.
- No, I can't do it.

01:25:20.331 --> 01:25:21.733
You don't have a choice.

01:25:23.867 --> 01:25:25.901
- You understand that, right?
- Mmm.

01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:27.606
You don't have a choice now.

01:25:54.898 --> 01:25:56.498
- What are you guys doing?
- Hey.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.036
We lost a ring.

01:26:01.039 --> 01:26:02.707
Cops came looking
for you today.

01:26:03.942 --> 01:26:06.676
Oh, yeah. I, um...
My wallet was stolen.

01:26:06.678 --> 01:26:09.381
So, yeah, no, I talked to them.
It's fine. It's good.

01:26:11.515 --> 01:26:14.083
- You're gonna bag that up when you're done, right?
- We'll put it all back.

01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:15.387
Sorry.

01:28:06.697 --> 01:28:08.965
Okay.

01:28:08.967 --> 01:28:10.999
You ready?

01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:12.133
- Oh.
- What?

01:28:12.135 --> 01:28:14.035
- Glasses.
- What?

01:28:14.037 --> 01:28:15.506
Glasses, glasses.

01:28:17.575 --> 01:28:19.644
Come on. Here.

01:28:21.979 --> 01:28:27.083
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.

01:28:27.085 --> 01:28:28.187
I love you.

01:28:31.089 --> 01:28:32.587
Okay.

01:28:32.589 --> 01:28:34.155
- All right.
- Oh.

01:28:34.157 --> 01:28:35.494
Come on.

01:28:39.664 --> 01:28:40.799
Glasses.

01:28:43.567 --> 01:28:45.236
Coming!

01:28:47.839 --> 01:28:50.306
You're gonna be all right.
We're gonna be all right.

01:28:50.308 --> 01:28:51.610
Okay.

01:28:57.714 --> 01:28:59.782
- I'm sorry, we were...
- No problem.

01:28:59.784 --> 01:29:02.150
I'm Detective Brennan. This is
my partner, Detective Tiller.

01:29:02.152 --> 01:29:03.088
Please, come in.

01:29:04.688 --> 01:29:06.221
And you are?

01:29:06.223 --> 01:29:09.257
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Mrs.
Woods's daytime attendant.

01:29:09.259 --> 01:29:12.761
Please, just this way. Can I
get you something to drink?

01:29:12.763 --> 01:29:14.062
- Uh, no, thank you.
- Okay.

01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:17.236
Miss Woods,
they're here.

01:29:20.705 --> 01:29:21.840
I had no idea.

01:29:23.741 --> 01:29:25.740
- Can she talk without it?
- Not really.

01:29:25.742 --> 01:29:27.144
Uh, maybe a few seconds.

01:29:38.222 --> 01:29:39.858
How you doin' today, Mrs.
Woods?

01:29:45.062 --> 01:29:47.229
I told, uh...
I didn't get your name.

01:29:47.231 --> 01:29:49.198
- Doug.
- Yeah.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.004
I'm Detective Brennan. This is
my partner, Detective Tiller.

01:29:55.906 --> 01:29:58.373
- Can we open the blinds so we can...
- It really hurts her eyes.

01:29:58.375 --> 01:29:59.677
I'm sorry.

01:30:01.778 --> 01:30:03.115
- Can I...
- Please.

01:30:22.967 --> 01:30:25.301
I met your daughter yesterday.
She here?

01:30:25.303 --> 01:30:26.638
No.

01:30:29.973 --> 01:30:34.209
So I told her a wallet got turned
in to us that we believe is yours.

01:30:34.211 --> 01:30:35.714
Did you lose your wallet?

01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:43.321
Do you remember how?

01:30:46.223 --> 01:30:47.925
Any recollection
where you lost it?

01:30:52.696 --> 01:30:56.233
Okay, what about the color?
Can you tell me what color it was?

01:31:04.241 --> 01:31:05.209
Red.

01:31:14.184 --> 01:31:15.286
This it?

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:20.922
Mrs. Woods,

01:31:20.924 --> 01:31:23.195
we believe someone might have
stolen your identification.

01:31:24.862 --> 01:31:26.395
Unfortunately,
it's not uncommon,

01:31:26.397 --> 01:31:28.300
particularly of
someone your age.

01:31:31.803 --> 01:31:34.206
Notice anything unusual
in your bank account?

01:31:44.314 --> 01:31:47.115
According to bank records,
they issued you a new card.

01:31:47.117 --> 01:31:48.954
I presume 'cause
the wallet was lost.

01:31:53.491 --> 01:31:56.028
And you cash all your own
pension checks and disability?

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:02.166
No one else?

01:32:05.068 --> 01:32:06.170
Good.

01:32:08.039 --> 01:32:09.140
That's good.

01:32:10.407 --> 01:32:11.742
One other question.

01:32:13.143 --> 01:32:15.410
Where is Kyra Johnson?

01:32:15.412 --> 01:32:17.245
- That's her daughter.
- The one I met?

01:32:17.247 --> 01:32:18.282
Yeah.

01:32:20.218 --> 01:32:24.153
Is there a reason why her ID
would be in your wallet?

01:32:26.223 --> 01:32:28.490
Okay, okay.

01:32:28.492 --> 01:32:29.460
It's okay.

01:32:32.062 --> 01:32:35.830
Maybe I should ask your daughter directly.
When is she due back?

01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:37.835
- She didn't say.
- She can answer.

01:32:42.072 --> 01:32:43.174
Later.

01:32:51.982 --> 01:32:53.751
Do you recognize
this grave?

01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:02.393
Step back.

01:33:11.835 --> 01:33:14.205
You don't really
need this, do you?

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:37.193
