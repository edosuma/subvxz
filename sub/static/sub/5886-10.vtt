00:01.209 --> 00:03.089
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:03.577 --> 00:04.548
Heaven's a little morbid.

00:04.665 --> 00:05.679
I didn't get to Heaven.

00:05.770 --> 00:07.233
Something terrible
has to happen.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.783
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happen in broad daylight

00:09.877 --> 00:11.930
and I can't be given
the same rewards.

00:12.654 --> 00:13.950
I'm sorry, but your
name escapes me.

00:14.059 --> 00:16.918
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm upstairs, in Accounts.

00:17.055 --> 00:18.997
You know,
but just in the outfield.

00:19.282 --> 00:20.304
What did they say?

00:20.479 --> 00:22.502
It's just like last time, no.

00:22.611 --> 00:24.435
We cannot go on like this.

00:24.528 --> 00:26.653
This is what Chevy
is paying us for.

00:26.759 --> 00:28.330
It's not our clock,
it's theirs.

00:28.416 --> 00:29.828
So what's another weekend?

01:07.636 --> 01:11.371
This convention instructs the
Democratic National Committee

01:11.406 --> 01:14.007
that it shall
include in the call

01:14.042 --> 01:16.543
for the 1972 convention

01:16.577 --> 01:20.179
<i>the following addition</i>
<i>to section one--</i>

01:20.213 --> 01:24.150
<i>quote, it is the further</i>
<i>understanding...</i>

01:24.184 --> 01:27.787
<i>Should I pack your swim trunks?</i>

01:27.822 --> 01:30.423
What?

01:35.194 --> 01:37.228
They're supposed
to be debating the war.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.965
They can debate it all they want,
they just can't come out against it.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.133
Then no one will vote
for Humphrey.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.402
Over Nixon?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.806
Well, they can't have the whole
convention without talking about the war.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.242
30 seconds after prime time,
they'll start the debate.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.512
Cops have been hassling
protesters all day.

01:54.546 --> 01:58.116
Also not in prime time.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.517
You're so cynical.

01:59.551 --> 02:00.952
Come over here.

02:06.724 --> 02:08.525
Come with me.

02:08.559 --> 02:10.094
We'll go back to Disneyland.

02:10.127 --> 02:12.329
From what I remember, something
amazing happened there.

02:12.364 --> 02:15.632
- I made the biggest mistake of my life.
- That's true.

02:18.336 --> 02:20.036
You know I'd come if I could.

02:20.070 --> 02:21.871
You'll have fun.

02:21.905 --> 02:24.474
Just stay away from actresses.

02:24.508 --> 02:26.442
Do they have them out there?

02:26.477 --> 02:28.644
I hate actresses.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.784
Kenny said that this time
he went to a floor

02:35.819 --> 02:37.352
in the Chevy building
he'd never been to before.

02:37.387 --> 02:39.054
He said it was
like "Get Smart."

02:39.088 --> 02:40.922
Just a bunch of doors
in procession.

02:40.956 --> 02:43.825
And he met the man he believes to be
the source of our current torture.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.528
- What's his name? - Same as the
rest of them-- Jack something.

02:46.562 --> 02:48.730
Apparently
his feelings were hurt

02:48.764 --> 02:50.399
because we haven't
kissed his ring.

02:50.433 --> 02:52.599
Well, I'd be happy to go
there and help soften him up.

02:52.634 --> 02:54.868
- If anyone's going, I'm going.
- But you can't

02:54.903 --> 02:57.138
because you're going to Los Angeles for--
what again?

02:57.172 --> 02:59.573
I'm going to pay them
a visit immediately.

02:59.607 --> 03:02.009
We don't want to miss our flight.
Are we going?

03:02.044 --> 03:03.544
Right after
the partners' meeting.

03:03.578 --> 03:05.712
Oh.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.683
Are we done here?

03:10.717 --> 03:13.253
Sweetheart, could you step out?

03:15.756 --> 03:17.723
This morning I received
an envelope addressed to

03:17.758 --> 03:19.825
Sterling Gleason and Pryce.

03:19.860 --> 03:22.095
- From who?
- It doesn't matter.

03:22.129 --> 03:24.863
They don't know our name because
we don't know our name.

03:24.897 --> 03:27.132
Aren't we SCDPCGC?

03:27.167 --> 03:28.567
Not officially.

03:28.601 --> 03:30.635
Well, I'm tired
of the conversation

03:30.670 --> 03:32.404
that goes along
with my business card.

03:32.439 --> 03:35.441
I know that no one has observed the
memo that requested specifically

03:35.475 --> 03:37.742
that all seven letters be used
when answering the phone.

03:37.777 --> 03:41.613
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Cutler
Gleason and Chaough? It's a mouthful.

03:41.647 --> 03:44.382
SCDPCGC <i>is</i> a mouthful.

03:44.416 --> 03:47.686
But CGCSCDP is <i>not.</i>

03:47.720 --> 03:50.354
- I don't agree.
- We've each lost a partner.

03:50.389 --> 03:52.057
Why don't we each
lose a letter?

03:52.091 --> 03:53.858
SCDC.

03:53.893 --> 03:56.527
- What do the Cs stand for?
- Not Campbell.

03:56.562 --> 03:57.895
Cooper and Cutler.

03:57.929 --> 03:59.396
Pardon me?

03:59.430 --> 04:03.000
Well, SCDCC sounds like a
stutter and looks like a typo.

04:04.302 --> 04:06.336
Very well, if it puts
this to rest,

04:06.370 --> 04:08.338
I will gladly withdraw my name

04:08.372 --> 04:12.109
along with the other deceased
parties in this conversation.

04:12.143 --> 04:13.943
Bert, don't be a martyr.

04:13.978 --> 04:16.345
Want to throw away
both of these brands?

04:16.379 --> 04:18.447
Just leave it alone. We'll
get a bigger front door.

04:18.482 --> 04:20.882
Well, of course you like it.
You're at the front.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.819
- I'm at the end.
- <i>I'm</i> at the end.

04:22.853 --> 04:24.520
Well, I move to table this.

04:24.554 --> 04:26.089
You have fun in Detroit.

04:26.123 --> 04:27.724
And you have fun
with Manischewitz.

04:27.758 --> 04:29.091
Any special instructions?

04:29.125 --> 04:32.527
Yeah, the guy in charge, just
pick an eye and stick with it.

04:32.561 --> 04:34.997
Very well, but it's my belief
that any further delay

04:35.031 --> 04:37.132
in choosing our name
will take it out of our hands

04:37.166 --> 04:39.334
and leave it up to the world.

04:48.877 --> 04:51.445
You know Sunkist is still
only doing print work?

04:51.479 --> 04:54.181
I'm cutting you off.

04:54.215 --> 04:57.217
- You're two ahead of me.
- No, from work.

04:57.252 --> 04:59.453
Come on.
We're executives.

04:59.487 --> 05:01.154
Leave the drudgery
to Ted Chaough

05:01.188 --> 05:02.488
and the rest of the underlings.

05:02.523 --> 05:03.723
Did you prepare at all?

05:03.758 --> 05:07.193
Sunkist, Carnation,
the avocado people.

05:07.227 --> 05:09.129
My biggest job
in these meetings

05:09.163 --> 05:11.865
is to keep them from saying
"golly" too many times.

05:11.899 --> 05:14.233
Carnation has 27 million
in billings.

05:14.268 --> 05:16.702
I don't think the guy in charge
ties his pants with a rope.

05:16.736 --> 05:19.337
I didn't say that. But I guarantee
they all have a certain regard

05:19.372 --> 05:20.873
for two gentlemen
from the big city.

05:20.907 --> 05:22.274
You mean they won't trust us?

05:22.308 --> 05:24.176
I mean they don't
trust themselves.

05:24.210 --> 05:25.577
I don't know if you realize it,

05:25.611 --> 05:27.612
but we are big New York admen

05:27.647 --> 05:29.982
from an agency with seven
letters in its name.

05:30.016 --> 05:32.051
That means under
no circumstances

05:32.085 --> 05:35.687
are you to trot out that drawl
you do when you've had too many.

05:35.721 --> 05:39.023
Be slick. Be glib.
Be <i>you.</i>

05:39.058 --> 05:41.759
Well, I'm usually informed.

05:41.794 --> 05:43.795
We're conquistadors.

05:43.829 --> 05:46.430
I'm Vasco da Gama and
you're some other Mexican.

05:46.464 --> 05:49.332
We're gonna land there, buy whatever
they've got for the beads in our pockets.

05:49.366 --> 05:52.803
Our biggest challenge
is to not get syphilis.

05:52.837 --> 05:54.871
Cathy.

05:54.906 --> 05:56.673
Another round.

05:56.708 --> 05:58.809
And send one to the pilot.

06:05.481 --> 06:07.316
<i>...hours of acrimonious debate,</i>

06:07.350 --> 06:09.919
<i>the Democratic National</i>
<i>Convention has rejected a plank</i>

06:09.953 --> 06:11.721
<i>advanced by Democratic doves</i>

06:11.755 --> 06:14.556
<i>calling for an unconditional</i>
<i>end to all bombing</i>

06:14.591 --> 06:16.625
<i>of North Vietnam.</i>

06:17.961 --> 06:19.494
What's going on?

06:19.529 --> 06:21.996
They delayed till noon
and then they rejected it.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.199
- Rejected what?
- The peace plank.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.701
Chance to have a platform
against the war.

06:26.736 --> 06:29.604
Uh-huh. Then let me
clarify my question.

06:29.638 --> 06:31.639
What's going on with
the work for Manischewitz?

06:31.673 --> 06:33.441
Because you're for the war.

06:33.475 --> 06:35.877
You know there's 200
body bags every week.

06:35.911 --> 06:37.611
Figure out how to get
into that business yet?

06:37.645 --> 06:39.880
I refuse to be distracted

06:39.914 --> 06:42.816
by events in which I have no
actual stake or participation.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.351
How could you say that?

06:44.385 --> 06:45.719
Because he doesn't
have any sons.

06:45.754 --> 06:48.055
I served in the Air Force.
Did you?

06:48.089 --> 06:50.457
You're disgusting,
you know that?

06:50.491 --> 06:53.459
This whole thing works because
people like you look the other way.

06:53.493 --> 06:56.028
- Ginsberg.
- My politics are private.

06:56.063 --> 06:57.563
But that presentation isn't.

06:57.597 --> 06:59.999
Now, are you gonna hide your
dawdling behind your outrage?

07:00.033 --> 07:01.768
You'll have your work
and you know it.

07:01.802 --> 07:04.771
You can go in there and take
credit for it like you always do.

07:04.805 --> 07:08.374
Be friendly and charming after you've
stuck your fascist boot on my neck.

07:08.408 --> 07:10.708
So I'm a fascist because
I gave you a deadline?

07:10.743 --> 07:13.044
No, you're a fascist
because you love business

07:13.079 --> 07:16.214
and you hate everything
else-- freedom, blacks, Jews.

07:16.249 --> 07:17.849
This is my stop.

07:17.884 --> 07:19.450
I hate hypocrites.

07:19.485 --> 07:22.821
Like hippies who cash checks from
Dow Chemical and General Motors.

07:22.855 --> 07:25.756
You rooting for the Soviets
in Prague, too, you Nazi?

07:25.791 --> 07:28.458
Michael, what are you doing?
That man is your boss.

07:28.493 --> 07:31.561
Why are you always down here?
Go back upstairs!

07:32.664 --> 07:34.698
You're a truncheon, Cutler.

07:36.501 --> 07:38.836
Thanks for making that worse.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.875
Hello, Ted.

07:45.910 --> 07:47.877
- You busy?
- Extremely.

07:47.912 --> 07:51.347
I think you know
I'm a man without regrets,

07:51.381 --> 07:53.749
but I do believe
we fired the wrong people

07:53.784 --> 07:55.985
and I'd like to remedy
that immediately.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.954
Jim, I think you're upset.

07:58.988 --> 08:01.023
No, because I have a solution.

08:01.057 --> 08:02.958
I think we should remove
the rest of their people

08:02.992 --> 08:05.560
while Sterling, Draper,
and Crane are in California.

08:05.594 --> 08:09.064
Just lock the gates and leave
Pete Campbell as the doorman.

08:09.098 --> 08:11.566
- What happened?
- Do I need cause?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.535
How about failure
to complete tasks

08:13.569 --> 08:15.136
coupled with gross
insubordination?

08:15.170 --> 08:17.572
Maybe part of it is you
keep seeing this agency

08:17.606 --> 08:19.341
as our people and their people.

08:19.375 --> 08:22.009
Well, how about your people
and my people?

08:22.044 --> 08:24.178
Do I have permission
to clean out creative,

08:24.213 --> 08:25.747
starting with
Mr. Ginsberg?

08:25.781 --> 08:27.515
Jim, he's lightning
in a bottle.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.250
You have to start holding
hands, starting with his.

08:30.284 --> 08:31.918
Because I'll be in
Detroit tomorrow

08:31.953 --> 08:33.486
and you're taking him
to Manischewitz.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.155
Sterling's client
and Draper's boy.

08:39.193 --> 08:41.227
I'm the world's
most expensive babysitter.

08:41.261 --> 08:42.496
That's the spirit.

08:45.966 --> 08:48.835
I suppose I wouldn't be a
good friend if I didn't ask--

08:48.869 --> 08:50.403
is Kate pulling
her weight around there?

08:50.437 --> 08:52.739
She arranged this.

08:52.773 --> 08:54.707
She did.

08:56.176 --> 08:59.645
Well, Kate told me that
you're the kind of woman

08:59.680 --> 09:01.781
who won't just tell me
what I want to hear.

09:01.815 --> 09:03.782
I hope she didn't make
any promises.

09:05.385 --> 09:07.319
My wife always says
I'm the kind of man

09:07.354 --> 09:09.721
who doesn't like
to ask for directions.

09:09.756 --> 09:12.224
My new job has me
face-to-face with ad agencies.

09:12.259 --> 09:13.558
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:13.593 --> 09:16.695
Kate said you were divorced.

09:17.897 --> 09:19.663
I am.

09:19.698 --> 09:21.232
I forgot.

09:21.267 --> 09:23.734
What does that say?

09:25.604 --> 09:28.072
Anyway, what should
I look for in an agency?

09:29.808 --> 09:32.911
Oh, well, a good agency
should tell you.

09:32.945 --> 09:34.644
Go ahead.

09:34.678 --> 09:36.179
Me?

09:36.214 --> 09:37.647
That's why I'm here.

09:42.153 --> 09:44.121
Yes.

09:44.155 --> 09:46.256
Of course.

09:47.525 --> 09:51.327
Well, I suppose we don't
just lean on

09:51.361 --> 09:53.462
stylish creative,
or market research.

09:53.496 --> 09:55.531
We listen to the client.

09:55.565 --> 09:57.599
Doesn't everybody do that?

09:57.634 --> 10:00.369
Despite your modesty,
you already know

10:00.404 --> 10:02.571
that the way to get invited
into people's homes

10:02.605 --> 10:04.140
is through their TV sets.

10:04.174 --> 10:08.076
Media placement is part
science, part courage.

10:08.110 --> 10:11.012
Anyone can tell you not to run
makeup ads during football.

10:11.047 --> 10:14.082
The trick is finding
your customers

10:14.116 --> 10:15.850
in places you hadn't
thought to look.

10:15.884 --> 10:18.320
Harry Crane is a wizard.

10:18.354 --> 10:21.323
They use a computer
the size of this restaurant.

10:21.357 --> 10:23.057
And what is your job there?

10:24.759 --> 10:27.027
I'm in charge
of thinking of things

10:27.062 --> 10:28.862
before people
know they need them.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.770
- I've got this.
- Come on.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.673
Please, this is what
I get paid to do.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.852
I was just coming to see you.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.588
But you're not going anywhere.

10:56.622 --> 10:59.291
I was, but then you appeared.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.326
At the risk of playing defense,

11:02.361 --> 11:05.863
I only interfered
because I hate disrespect.

11:05.897 --> 11:08.966
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:10.168 --> 11:12.336
- Neither do I.
- Hmm.

11:12.371 --> 11:15.272
I believe in you, Bob.
But you're untested.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.574
Manischewitz,
tomorrow afternoon--

11:17.609 --> 11:19.309
think you can handle
the parties involved?

11:19.343 --> 11:22.678
Michael Ginsberg
or the clients?

11:22.713 --> 11:24.680
I don't see much
difference, do you?

11:24.715 --> 11:27.783
I think I can
keep the volume down.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.752
Excellent.

11:29.786 --> 11:32.022
I welcome this chance to shine.

11:49.506 --> 11:52.573
- Are you on a deadline?
- No, do you need me?

11:52.607 --> 11:54.008
I need a drink.

11:54.043 --> 11:55.609
Okay.

11:55.644 --> 11:57.645
I had this lunch
my friend Kate set up

11:57.679 --> 12:00.048
and I think
it's a potential client.

12:00.082 --> 12:01.949
- I know he is.
- Who is he?

12:01.983 --> 12:03.918
The new head
of marketing at Avon.

12:05.854 --> 12:08.055
I thought it was a date, but
it turned out to be better.

12:08.089 --> 12:09.990
- I love Avon.
- Of course.

12:10.025 --> 12:11.659
And you'd be perfect for it.

12:11.693 --> 12:14.494
It's just-- I don't know
what to do with it.

12:14.529 --> 12:16.329
He's leaving town tomorrow.

12:16.364 --> 12:18.098
So set a meeting.

12:18.132 --> 12:19.900
I know I have to,
but Don's not here

12:19.935 --> 12:21.669
and I don't want to get
kicked off the diving board.

12:21.703 --> 12:23.870
We'll take it to Ted.

12:23.904 --> 12:26.238
- He'll know what to do.
- What did I just say?

12:26.273 --> 12:27.907
He's not like that.

12:29.242 --> 12:30.610
And what do I ask for?

12:30.644 --> 12:32.278
I don't know.

12:32.312 --> 12:34.781
You'll be the account man
if that's what you want.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.217
Trust me,
he loves new business.

12:38.251 --> 12:40.919
He doesn't care where it comes from.
Let's go.

12:45.291 --> 12:48.159
- I told you I wanted a rental car.
- They insisted.

12:48.194 --> 12:50.295
- Ted, do you have a minute?
- Just barely.

12:50.329 --> 12:53.131
Well, it's kind of urgent.
Joan has a solid lead.

12:53.165 --> 12:54.899
He's leaving tomorrow.
We need to set a meeting.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.934
Good for you. Get Pete
Campbell down here.

12:56.969 --> 12:59.870
- Who is it?
- It's Avon Cosmetics.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.706
<i>- It's Moira. Can you send him down</i>
<i>immediately?</i> - Very groovy.

13:01.740 --> 13:05.009
The new head of marketing, he's a
friend of a very close friend of mine

13:05.043 --> 13:06.677
and I just wanted
to introduce him to Peggy.

13:06.712 --> 13:08.846
- Peggy'd be perfect for it.
- You rang?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.247
Pete, as head
of new business--

13:10.281 --> 13:11.982
Since when?
I don't want that.

13:12.016 --> 13:13.717
Joan has a lead
for Avon Cosmetics.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.519
Peggy's creative. He's leaving
town tomorrow. Reel him in.

13:16.553 --> 13:19.489
<i>Fly safe.</i>

13:19.523 --> 13:21.290
Avon Cosmetics.

13:21.325 --> 13:23.493
That's Fortune 500.
What's his name?

13:23.527 --> 13:25.495
Andy Hayes.

13:25.529 --> 13:29.064
My friend Kate just moved there from
Mary Kay and she sent him my way.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.334
Tell me everything you can about him and
set lunch tomorrow for Peggy and me.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.269
I should be there.

13:34.303 --> 13:36.739
Joan, this is how
things get botched.

13:36.773 --> 13:38.573
First, account man
and creative.

13:38.608 --> 13:40.342
Then if all goes well,
next trip

13:40.376 --> 13:42.577
he visits the office
and you show him around.

13:42.612 --> 13:45.046
I think he'll be expecting me.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.748
Shouldn't Joan
make the introductions?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.582
I don't understand
what the problem is.

13:48.617 --> 13:50.618
You're going to make the call

13:50.653 --> 13:53.487
and tell him how important I
am and how exciting Peggy is.

13:53.522 --> 13:56.157
And then we're going to tell
him how essential you are.

13:57.693 --> 13:59.926
Don't worry.
You'll get all the credit.

14:01.595 --> 14:03.664
Clara.
Are you coming?

14:37.462 --> 14:39.898
Hey, I let you sit up front.

14:39.932 --> 14:42.433
Sorry about that.
You need a hand?

14:42.467 --> 14:43.802
What?

14:46.771 --> 14:48.939
There's no one
from GM in Los Angeles?

14:48.973 --> 14:50.507
Get rid of that car.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.109
And get us something
with a roof.

14:52.143 --> 14:54.511
Don't want to show up to a
meeting with bugs in my teeth.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.646
So, you want to take
a dip in the pool

14:56.681 --> 14:58.281
or should I
just wait in the bar?

14:58.316 --> 15:00.483
- Both have attractive scenery.
- Where's the bellman?

15:00.518 --> 15:03.186
Mañana, Don.
Everything's mañana here.

15:03.220 --> 15:05.922
I'm gonna take a shower. You can
wait in the bar if you want.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.724
I'm gonna get room service.

15:07.758 --> 15:09.258
We're gonna go
to the Sunset Strip,

15:09.292 --> 15:10.760
watch a girl dance in a cage.

15:10.794 --> 15:12.261
That you heard?

15:12.295 --> 15:13.529
Save your strength
for tomorrow.

15:13.563 --> 15:15.631
Going to a party in the hills.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.466
- It's very hip.
- Beverly Hills?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.468
No, <i>the</i> hills. And
it's movies, not TV.

15:20.502 --> 15:23.504
My friend in development at CBS says
it's going to be crawling with moguls.

15:23.539 --> 15:25.373
- Jesus, it's hot here.
- It's a dry heat.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.209
It's a dry heave.

15:27.243 --> 15:29.510
Come on, Don, let's go to the Strip
right now and get some dinner.

15:29.545 --> 15:31.079
No, I'm gonna turn in.

15:31.114 --> 15:33.882
Tried to sleep on the plane, but
somebody wouldn't stop talking.

15:37.285 --> 15:39.419
Don't worry, I got this.

15:42.893 --> 15:44.761
<i>This is on tape since again
we're not able to cover it live.</i>

15:44.795 --> 15:46.462
The tape you're about
to see was made

15:46.497 --> 15:49.164
about 30 to 40 minutes ago.

16:33.641 --> 16:37.275
<i>It was supposed to be a
nonviolent demonstration today.</i>

16:40.079 --> 16:42.948
<i>And one will never know</i>
<i>what it was</i>

16:42.982 --> 16:45.183
<i>that made it become violent.</i>

16:47.520 --> 16:49.621
<i>This is directly
in front of what advertises itself</i>

16:49.656 --> 16:52.022
<i>as the world's largest</i>
<i>and friendliest hotel.</i>

16:52.057 --> 16:54.692
<i>Where at this hour</i>
<i>people stand around</i>

16:54.726 --> 16:56.226
<i>and sit in their rooms</i>
<i>with handkerchiefs...</i>

16:56.261 --> 16:59.196
- Hello.
- Are you watching this?

16:59.230 --> 17:01.499
Yeah.

17:01.533 --> 17:03.167
It's hard to believe
no one got killed.

17:03.201 --> 17:06.170
That the only measure?

17:06.204 --> 17:08.605
Can you imagine a policeman
cracking your skull?

17:08.638 --> 17:10.207
It would change
your whole life.

17:10.241 --> 17:12.209
Honey, they're throwing rocks.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.810
They're prepared for trouble.

17:19.017 --> 17:21.285
<i>In some places, plainclothesmen</i>

17:21.319 --> 17:22.853
<i>are helping make the arrests.</i>

17:26.556 --> 17:30.226
On the bright side, Conrad Hilton is
probably in that hotel right now.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.161
Don't make jokes.

17:32.196 --> 17:34.063
Megan, you can't even vote.

17:35.265 --> 17:37.133
But I live here.

17:38.902 --> 17:40.636
I'm sorry.

17:45.775 --> 17:48.811
I want you to be careful.

17:48.845 --> 17:50.479
This could easily start a riot.

17:50.514 --> 17:52.781
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

17:52.816 --> 17:54.750
Really?

17:54.784 --> 17:56.985
You can if you want to.

17:57.019 --> 17:59.587
I miss you.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.391
Go for a swim.

18:03.425 --> 18:05.359
It always makes you
feel better.

18:05.394 --> 18:08.496
<i>The whole world is watching.</i>

18:11.500 --> 18:14.601
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.737
<i>There's a break
in the arrests now...</i>

18:16.771 --> 18:19.439
We should hang up.
This is costing a fortune.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.575
Try and get some sleep.

18:21.609 --> 18:23.644
You, too.

18:23.678 --> 18:26.112
Bye.

18:28.016 --> 18:30.182
Bye.

18:49.035 --> 18:51.836
So you came after all.

18:51.871 --> 18:53.738
Pete couldn't make it.

18:53.773 --> 18:56.608
What? How the hell are
we supposed to do this?

18:56.642 --> 18:58.877
Don't worry about it.
Coffee, please.

19:00.512 --> 19:02.880
I didn't know Ted was going
to handle it that way.

19:02.914 --> 19:04.848
Well, he did.

19:04.883 --> 19:08.686
And Pete's not coming...

19:08.720 --> 19:10.054
because he wasn't invited.

19:11.990 --> 19:14.625
- You can't do that.
- I did it.

19:14.659 --> 19:16.460
If you want to leave, go ahead.

19:16.494 --> 19:19.929
I hope I didn't keep you waiting,
but I was trying to check out.

19:19.964 --> 19:22.098
See, if you were a client,
you could have left your key

19:22.132 --> 19:24.667
at the desk and we would
have attended to that.

19:24.702 --> 19:26.703
Andy Hayes, Peggy Olson.

19:26.737 --> 19:28.671
She's the dynamite
in our creative department.

19:28.706 --> 19:30.139
I don't know about that.

19:30.173 --> 19:31.808
Tomato juice
and coffee, please.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.978
I didn't want you to leave New
York without meeting Peggy.

19:36.012 --> 19:39.081
Her expertise has been honed
by her work on Clearasil,

19:39.115 --> 19:42.150
Pond's Cold Cream, and most
relevant, Belle Jolie lipsticks.

19:42.184 --> 19:43.885
I almost worked there.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.420
Do you remember
"Mark your man"?

19:45.454 --> 19:47.022
I do.

19:47.056 --> 19:49.356
I grew up in an Avon home.

19:49.390 --> 19:51.959
Our lady was Gladys Bowman.

19:51.994 --> 19:53.694
She was very elegant.

19:53.729 --> 19:57.031
My mother would vacuum
the drapes before she came.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.500
Then my sister and I would
fight over the catalogue.

19:59.534 --> 20:02.202
- In fact--
- In fact, all women

20:02.237 --> 20:05.238
have some kind of personal
connection to Avon.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.674
But that doesn't turn into
advertising, now, does it?

20:07.708 --> 20:10.510
Why don't you tell us
your biggest challenge?

20:10.544 --> 20:13.980
We're here to listen. It's just
hard to hide our enthusiasm.

20:14.015 --> 20:16.215
It's true.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.118
Well, they don't
bring in a new guy

20:18.152 --> 20:21.053
unless they're expanding
or sales are flat.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.689
I'm afraid it's the latter.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.324
Women are working.
They're not home.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.161
And hippies don't wear
makeup at all.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.363
I'm not sure if we should
try to be "groovier"

20:31.397 --> 20:33.398
or nostalgic.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.600
We're somewhere
in between right now.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.871
That's about it.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.474
Peggy?

20:43.508 --> 20:45.677
Yes, Joan?

20:49.214 --> 20:51.549
What do you think
of your current work?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.249
Besides the fact
that it's not working?

20:55.219 --> 20:57.220
It's okay.
We didn't do it.

20:57.254 --> 20:59.222
I don't know how
to describe it.

20:59.256 --> 21:02.092
Would you say it's
unintentionally old-fashioned?

21:02.126 --> 21:04.027
Yes.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.395
Yes, I would.

21:06.564 --> 21:08.498
I'm sure you've thought
of this already,

21:08.532 --> 21:11.100
but Joan and I were saying
how convenient it would be

21:11.134 --> 21:14.403
to have the Avon lady come to
the office maybe during lunch.

21:14.437 --> 21:17.807
Well, they're not resistant to
trying that, just to advertising it.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.109
There's no doorbell
in an office.

21:25.981 --> 21:27.749
I only saw a little bit
of it on the morning news,

21:27.783 --> 21:31.086
but I'm sorry I missed
Humphrey's acceptance speech.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.821
I assume he was
high-voiced and desperate.

21:32.855 --> 21:35.556
You're the exception. Early numbers
look like over 80 million people.

21:35.591 --> 21:38.093
Look, we all hated what we saw,

21:38.127 --> 21:40.861
but the Democrats are dead.
It's over.

21:40.895 --> 21:43.897
Not just now, maybe forever.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.168
As you were.
Nobody get up.

21:48.203 --> 21:50.170
Nonsense, Jack.
Great to see you finally.

21:50.205 --> 21:52.005
Roger Sterling, Don Draper.

21:54.042 --> 21:57.409
George was just laughing that these
riots gave Nixon the election.

21:59.079 --> 22:01.013
I don't think that's
anything to smile about.

22:02.282 --> 22:04.316
And although this boardroom
has been the site

22:04.351 --> 22:06.753
of many casual
political conversations

22:06.787 --> 22:08.587
among better men than us,

22:08.622 --> 22:10.223
this is a business meeting.

22:10.257 --> 22:12.424
You're right, Jack.

22:13.692 --> 22:15.460
Last night was disgusting,

22:15.494 --> 22:19.965
seeing those long-haired
fools <i>shame</i> this country.

22:19.999 --> 22:23.068
You think Richard Nixon
is going to fix that?

22:23.102 --> 22:25.603
I think he's a patriot.

22:25.638 --> 22:27.538
Dutch Reagan is a patriot.

22:27.573 --> 22:29.406
Nixon is an opportunist.

22:31.877 --> 22:34.979
Now why don't you gentlemen
tell us how it's possible

22:35.013 --> 22:37.047
to devote your energies
to our nutritious

22:37.082 --> 22:39.049
and delicious Instant Breakfast

22:39.084 --> 22:41.385
and Life Cereal
at the same time?

22:42.921 --> 22:45.088
Well, Jack,

22:45.122 --> 22:48.224
your powdered milk
and dairy products

22:48.259 --> 22:51.828
have had a long, successful
relationship with breakfast cereal.

22:51.862 --> 22:53.596
There's no reason
to give that up.

22:53.630 --> 22:55.531
And as far as we can tell,

22:55.565 --> 22:58.367
Instant Breakfast has
a different target-- adults.

22:59.569 --> 23:01.069
They don't eat cereal.

23:01.104 --> 23:03.205
They eat bacon and eggs.

23:03.239 --> 23:05.340
And this is healthier,

23:05.374 --> 23:08.310
easier, and instant.

23:08.344 --> 23:11.746
And what if we were to say we
find the conflict unresolvable?

23:11.781 --> 23:14.283
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we
discussed this over the phone.

23:14.317 --> 23:17.952
This is about a whole different level
of exposure for your products.

23:17.986 --> 23:20.321
All of them. You should
be in game shows.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.889
You should have a presence
on Saturday morning.

23:21.924 --> 23:24.358
Where we'll sit right next
to one of your cereal ads?

23:25.861 --> 23:28.930
- Don?
- Look, Jack, George,

23:28.964 --> 23:32.966
I'm sure you know that we would
do anything to make this work.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.135
We believe that strongly
in Carnation.

23:35.169 --> 23:36.703
We believe in the wholesomeness

23:36.737 --> 23:40.540
of both your intentions
and your products.

23:40.574 --> 23:42.475
To be frank,

23:42.509 --> 23:45.111
we've worked with
New York firms before.

23:45.146 --> 23:47.547
We come in in the
morning, try to get you,

23:47.581 --> 23:49.181
everyone's at lunch.

23:49.216 --> 23:51.250
And when people
are at lunch around here,

23:51.284 --> 23:53.986
that's just the time
we get a message from you.

23:54.020 --> 23:56.621
And with it comes an attitude

23:56.656 --> 23:59.158
as if to say we're not
working hard out here.

23:59.192 --> 24:02.394
I can assure you, it is
very much to the contrary.

24:02.428 --> 24:05.663
Look, we're sorry your
last girlfriend hurt you.

24:06.832 --> 24:08.566
We're in your office right now.

24:11.803 --> 24:13.404
Tell us what you have in mind.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.245
What is going on? I just handed
you the business of your life.

24:24.279 --> 24:26.414
What is going on?
You just threw it away.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.549
Morning, ladies.

24:28.584 --> 24:30.884
- Morning.
- Morning.

24:30.919 --> 24:32.886
Stop that.

24:32.921 --> 24:35.623
What exactly
are you planning to do?

24:35.657 --> 24:37.658
Are you trying
to intimidate me?

24:37.692 --> 24:40.494
No, that's always
been impossible

24:40.528 --> 24:42.562
because that would require
respect for me or what I do.

24:42.597 --> 24:46.399
I know you want this,
and now you can't have it.

24:46.434 --> 24:48.268
You could've,
but now you can't.

24:48.302 --> 24:51.171
It's mine. And I've
been doing account work

24:51.205 --> 24:53.273
in one form or another
since the day I started.

24:53.307 --> 24:54.840
But you're not in
that department.

24:54.874 --> 24:56.408
I never said that to you

24:56.443 --> 24:58.043
when you stopped filing
and started writing copy.

24:58.077 --> 24:59.545
Yes, you did.
Every day.

24:59.579 --> 25:01.013
And it was worse
because you made me feel

25:01.047 --> 25:03.182
like I couldn't do it.

25:03.216 --> 25:05.017
I know you can do this.

25:05.051 --> 25:06.785
So why do you think
I should give it away?

25:06.819 --> 25:08.521
I worked my way up.

25:08.555 --> 25:10.555
You were so brave,

25:10.589 --> 25:12.690
letting Don carry you
to the deep end of the pool.

25:12.724 --> 25:14.325
I never slept with him.

25:17.929 --> 25:21.366
Congratulations. You
really are just like them.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.469
I'm sorry, but I never thought I
would be in the position to say,

25:24.503 --> 25:26.003
"Joan, you've made
a mistake."

25:26.038 --> 25:28.405
I have to do it myself, Peggy.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.907
This is the only way
I could do it.

25:30.941 --> 25:34.711
Because all that matters now is who
has a relationship with that client.

25:34.745 --> 25:35.945
Who is the client
going to call?

25:35.980 --> 25:37.714
Well, I am sick to my stomach

25:37.748 --> 25:40.050
thinking about what you're going
to say when they find out.

25:40.084 --> 25:41.451
I'll be fine.

25:45.789 --> 25:47.657
<i>Gentlemen, after all,</i>

25:47.691 --> 25:51.360
<i>this business of selling</i>
<i>narrows down to one thing.</i>

25:51.395 --> 25:54.497
<i>Just one thing.</i>
<i>Seeing the people.</i>

25:54.531 --> 25:57.633
<i>Show me any
man of ordinary ability</i>

25:57.668 --> 25:59.501
<i>who will go out</i>
<i>and earnestly tell...</i>

25:59.535 --> 26:01.869
Benson here.

26:09.978 --> 26:12.046
- Ginzo, you have a visitor.
- Where is he?

26:14.583 --> 26:16.817
Michael?

26:16.851 --> 26:19.086
- What's wrong?
- I feel sick.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.322
I got diarrhea.
My mouth is dry.

26:21.356 --> 26:24.191
I didn't sleep last night. I
don't want to go. I'm not going.

26:24.226 --> 26:25.892
Oh, sure.
You'll talk to him?

26:25.927 --> 26:29.430
I love you, you know that.
You're a mother hen.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.464
- Michael, you look fine.
- Stop calling me Michael.

26:31.498 --> 26:34.900
We have to go.
It's a very important meeting.

26:34.935 --> 26:36.336
And I don't say
that to scare you,

26:36.370 --> 26:38.170
I say that to inspire you.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.473
I'm not scared.
I'm a thug.

26:40.507 --> 26:43.276
I'm a pig.
I'm part of the problem.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.878
"Now I am become Death.
Destroyer of worlds."

26:46.912 --> 26:49.814
Come on, buddy.
You're not Death.

26:49.849 --> 26:51.416
You got a little stage fright.

26:51.451 --> 26:53.051
Maybe you smoked
too many funny cigarettes.

26:53.085 --> 26:55.120
I never touch that stuff.
It makes you crazy.

26:55.154 --> 26:57.188
I know what you're feeling
and it's fear.

26:57.223 --> 27:00.559
But not fear of failure,
fear of opportunity.

27:00.593 --> 27:02.693
I can't watch this.

27:02.728 --> 27:06.196
Look, you can't put yourself in the
right place at the right time.

27:06.231 --> 27:08.866
You got to be in the right
place all the time.

27:08.900 --> 27:13.271
Listen, man, I can't turn off
the transmissions to do harm.

27:13.305 --> 27:14.938
They're beaming them
right into my head.

27:14.973 --> 27:17.107
Damn it, there is
no harm in this!

27:17.142 --> 27:19.876
Manischewitz are good people.
They're your people.

27:19.910 --> 27:23.446
And they sell wine for religious
ceremonies of all faiths.

27:23.481 --> 27:26.750
Now pull yourself together
and be the man that I admire.

27:35.091 --> 27:36.792
Tell me the truth.
Are you a homo?

27:36.826 --> 27:39.261
There's that sense of humor.

27:52.140 --> 27:53.908
I would like
to have her for lunch.

27:53.942 --> 27:56.243
Well, don't have
Harry Crane set it up.

27:56.278 --> 27:58.813
He got us very high up
with three major companies.

27:58.847 --> 28:00.848
You forgot because Chevy
fell in your lap,

28:00.882 --> 28:03.718
but big accounts require
a golf and dining offensive.

28:03.752 --> 28:05.653
When are we gonna do that?

28:05.688 --> 28:07.287
Next time.

28:11.826 --> 28:13.527
Harry, what did I say
about that car?

28:17.164 --> 28:19.833
Well, Cindy, these are
my friends Don and Roger.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.635
A pleasure.

28:21.669 --> 28:23.569
There's tacos
and booze outside.

28:23.603 --> 28:26.872
If you want a joint, try the
candy dish on the coffee table.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.708
Or make a friend.

28:28.742 --> 28:30.409
You look familiar.

28:30.444 --> 28:32.745
You'll have to do
better than that.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.991
As you can tell, there's
a different protocol.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.293
I look forward
to figuring it out.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.829
Just let me make introductions.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.731
They don't take business cards.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.598
Who is that?

28:54.632 --> 28:56.500
I know him.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.669
Earl Rice from Kodak.
He's their studio rep.

28:58.703 --> 29:01.304
I don't think he was there when you were.
I know he never goes east.

29:01.339 --> 29:02.906
No, not him.
Isn't that Danny?

29:04.442 --> 29:06.042
Jesus, he is everywhere.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.911
It's Daniel J. Siegel now.

29:07.945 --> 29:10.113
Danny Siegel?

29:10.147 --> 29:12.749
Producer. And that's Irwin Fields.
He's at Paramount.

29:12.783 --> 29:14.283
What's he doing here?

29:14.317 --> 29:16.051
Probably trying to buy
one of Danny's movies.

29:16.086 --> 29:17.319
Not him.

29:18.756 --> 29:22.258
Roger, Don. Where've
you been all my life?

29:22.292 --> 29:24.694
Come on.
This will be fun.

29:24.728 --> 29:27.262
Daniel, my man.
Did we interrupt?

29:27.296 --> 29:30.064
It'll keep, man.

29:31.233 --> 29:33.702
Danny. What are you
up to these days?

29:33.736 --> 29:37.539
Taking care of business.
That was Irwin Fields.

29:37.573 --> 29:41.510
And this is just Lotus.
She's from Sacramento.

29:41.544 --> 29:42.877
So how do you know Stephen?

29:42.911 --> 29:44.311
Oh, I've known
Stephen a long time.

29:44.345 --> 29:47.147
Whereas Danny we've only
known for a very short time.

29:49.350 --> 29:52.019
I know these lugs back
from my days in advertising.

29:52.053 --> 29:53.721
More like a day, wasn't it?

29:53.755 --> 29:55.589
Hey, it wasn't my bag.
I had to quit.

29:55.624 --> 29:57.925
You didn't quit.
You were fired.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.330
Harry, why don't you
introduce me to the bar?

30:08.201 --> 30:10.870
Actually, Danny and I
used to be related.

30:10.905 --> 30:13.406
Daniel.

30:13.441 --> 30:15.741
His ex-wife
is still my cousin.

30:15.775 --> 30:19.345
You'd like her.
She's about your age.

30:19.379 --> 30:21.080
There are small differences.

30:21.114 --> 30:23.249
Tiny things you'd notice.

30:25.285 --> 30:27.019
Stephen.

30:27.054 --> 30:28.854
I was just telling Lotus
here how I'm finally

30:28.888 --> 30:30.656
making a picture
with a major studio.

30:30.690 --> 30:32.424
We're gonna do
"Alice in Wonderland."

30:32.458 --> 30:34.359
And Stephen over there

30:34.393 --> 30:37.595
works for Ben Kalmenson,
president of Warner Brothers,

30:37.629 --> 30:39.831
who's also here somewhere.

30:39.865 --> 30:42.200
He took over from Jack Warner.

30:42.234 --> 30:44.469
You know what, Lotus?

30:44.503 --> 30:46.571
I'm gonna introduce you.

30:46.605 --> 30:48.605
Nice rapping with you, Rog.

30:59.117 --> 31:01.618
So most of the pictures don't
have a lot of score right now.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.153
They like pop songs. You know,
kids want to hear a hit.

31:04.188 --> 31:06.189
I think ads are going
that way, too.

31:06.223 --> 31:07.656
What kind of ads you do?

31:07.691 --> 31:10.559
Well, we represent
Chevrolet, Mohawk Airlines.

31:10.594 --> 31:12.962
- Where are they?
- The northeast.

31:12.997 --> 31:15.798
Samsonite luggage.
Life Cereal.

31:17.267 --> 31:20.202
Well, if times get tough,
I'm gonna look you up, Donny.

31:20.236 --> 31:24.006
I dig jingles and I hear
the bread's out of sight.

31:28.411 --> 31:31.513
Don, there you are.
Ben Kalmenson's leaving.

31:31.547 --> 31:34.483
I think he's heading to a party in the canyon.
Should we follow him?

31:34.517 --> 31:37.151
- You know Ben?
- Do you?

31:45.494 --> 31:47.094
I was looking for the restroom.

31:48.563 --> 31:50.998
Well, there's an extra nipple
here when you come back.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.700
It can wait.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.769
Take off your shoes.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.349
Do you like hashish?

32:10.383 --> 32:12.384
I don't know yet.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.595
<i>Hey Man, are you the
guy who came in a taxi?</i>

32:31.148 --> 32:34.650
You don't talk much, do you?

32:34.685 --> 32:36.619
In fact, I'm wondering if
you're hearing a word I say.

32:36.653 --> 32:38.421
Are you tripping?

32:40.057 --> 32:42.692
I've done it five times.

32:42.726 --> 32:44.659
So if you're trying
to see through me,

32:44.694 --> 32:46.628
just know that
I am this handsome

32:46.662 --> 32:48.363
and this rich.

32:48.397 --> 32:50.498
Don't worry
about your hang-ups.

32:51.835 --> 32:54.569
Lotus, let's split.

32:54.604 --> 32:57.439
Together?

32:57.473 --> 32:59.941
She's gonna crash
in my guesthouse.

32:59.975 --> 33:02.210
- Until her audition?
- It's up to her, man.

33:02.244 --> 33:03.911
I'm sure it is.
Lotus, honey,

33:03.946 --> 33:05.312
there's no reason
to start at the bottom.

33:05.347 --> 33:07.481
Yeah, maybe he can help
your dream come true

33:07.515 --> 33:09.416
of having your lips
on the side of a bus.

33:09.451 --> 33:11.886
What are you gonna do when you fail here?
Keep going west?

33:11.920 --> 33:14.188
Japan's a long walk
for those little legs.

33:15.189 --> 33:17.590
Lotus, let's go.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.659
You're lucky
I hate violence, man.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.228
Really? I love it.

33:21.262 --> 33:22.929
You know, I was a boxer.

33:22.964 --> 33:24.998
There's nothing like
finding that magic spot

33:25.032 --> 33:26.599
that'll drop a man
to his knees.

33:26.634 --> 33:28.869
You know, unless he's
already starting there.

33:33.206 --> 33:35.040
Hated to do that.

33:42.082 --> 33:43.983
Mmm.

33:45.485 --> 33:47.585
I'm really thirsty.

33:47.619 --> 33:51.489
There's a pool full of
water out there, Don.

33:51.523 --> 33:54.159
I told you, that's not my name.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.473
There you are.

34:11.943 --> 34:13.677
Honey, I--

34:16.147 --> 34:18.114
you're here.

34:18.149 --> 34:19.748
Is that your old lady?

34:19.783 --> 34:22.484
It's cool.
It's California.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.821
Everybody shares.

34:24.855 --> 34:27.623
What are you doing here?

34:27.657 --> 34:30.159
I thought I'd surprise you.

34:32.129 --> 34:33.795
How did you find me?

34:33.831 --> 34:36.297
But I live here.

34:40.136 --> 34:42.237
I quit my job.

34:42.271 --> 34:44.572
I couldn't bear to be apart.

34:44.606 --> 34:48.810
And I want to have enough love

34:48.844 --> 34:50.878
for my other surprise.

34:56.318 --> 34:58.886
Really?

34:58.920 --> 35:02.022
What do you think it is?

35:02.057 --> 35:04.191
A second chance.

35:06.694 --> 35:08.527
Come with me.

35:45.397 --> 35:47.932
Everybody's looking for you.

35:55.373 --> 35:58.375
I heard you were here.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.878
Are you in
the movie business, too?

36:03.281 --> 36:05.481
I'm not pitching
for the Dodgers.

36:06.517 --> 36:07.750
What happened?

36:07.785 --> 36:10.253
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

36:10.288 --> 36:13.889
My wife thinks I'm MIA,
but I'm actually dead.

36:16.092 --> 36:18.493
How come you didn't
get your arm back?

36:18.528 --> 36:20.429
Dying doesn't make you whole.

36:20.463 --> 36:22.497
You should see
what you look like.

36:23.866 --> 36:25.667
<i>Man overboard!</i>

36:39.915 --> 36:42.516
He's fine.
Everybody back away.

37:02.169 --> 37:04.937
- Is it real? - They took me to breakfast
on the way to the airport

37:04.972 --> 37:07.706
and told me Jack signed off.
And he's high enough at Chevy

37:07.740 --> 37:09.775
he doesn't have to run it
by the whole outfit and--

37:09.809 --> 37:11.810
<i>Bob Benson to see you both.</i>

37:11.845 --> 37:13.346
They finally let me
see the car.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.880
They had clay models.
It's not a dog.

37:15.914 --> 37:17.682
I don't mean to interrupt.

37:17.716 --> 37:20.718
- But that's what you're doing.
- Come on in, Bob.

37:23.422 --> 37:25.790
I just got off the phone
with Manischewitz.

37:25.824 --> 37:27.725
Apparently they're
putting us in review.

37:27.759 --> 37:31.329
- What happened?
- They barely listened to the presentation.

37:31.364 --> 37:34.365
It was a courtesy. They haven't
liked the work for months.

37:34.399 --> 37:36.433
Shit!
Weren't you there?

37:36.468 --> 37:38.703
Well, I thought it was
high time we embraced Bob.

37:38.737 --> 37:41.338
He was going to go.
I talked him out of it.

37:41.373 --> 37:45.042
Roger Sterling let you
watch his dog and it ran away.

37:46.845 --> 37:50.881
Bob, we appreciate you
handling this like a man.

37:50.915 --> 37:52.749
And as a reward,

37:52.783 --> 37:55.885
Ted and I want you to familiarize
yourself with Chevy.

37:55.919 --> 37:58.187
We just found out
we're moving to the next step.

37:58.222 --> 38:01.190
We're going to need
more than Ken in Detroit.

38:02.393 --> 38:04.460
That's music to my ears.

38:04.495 --> 38:06.496
Welcome aboard.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.935
They shouldn't have
gone to California.

38:13.969 --> 38:16.638
We're going to bring in Avon.
They gave us Chevy.

38:16.672 --> 38:18.473
Throw in losing
Sterling's account,

38:18.508 --> 38:20.375
I think we have
a lot of good news.

38:20.410 --> 38:22.177
They're not gonna think that.

38:22.211 --> 38:25.013
You're splitting this place
and not in half.

38:25.048 --> 38:28.115
We'll give them something
to take their mind off it.

38:28.150 --> 38:29.816
What do we have?

38:40.695 --> 38:43.229
You caught a cold
in California.

38:43.264 --> 38:45.465
I don't know what happened.

38:45.499 --> 38:47.900
I usually feel
better out there.

38:47.935 --> 38:50.203
You've got to stop
talking in the past.

38:50.237 --> 38:52.205
You know what I learned?

38:52.239 --> 38:55.341
New York is the center
of the universe.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.277
We could send
a landing craft out there,

38:57.311 --> 38:59.744
but they don't understand
what we do.

38:59.779 --> 39:01.780
Or they understand it
thoroughly.

39:02.848 --> 39:04.483
My shrink says
the job of your life

39:04.517 --> 39:05.984
is to know yourself.

39:06.018 --> 39:09.488
<i>Sooner or later, you'll start</i>
<i>to love who you are.</i>

39:09.522 --> 39:12.524
And apparently
I'm a curious child

39:12.559 --> 39:15.926
with a full head of hair
and a thriving business.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.132
And you're a terrible swimmer.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.914
Come in.

39:35.949 --> 39:38.282
Mr. Campbell wants to see you
in the conference room.

39:39.484 --> 39:42.586
Oh.
And what is it regarding?

39:42.620 --> 39:45.456
Avon sent over a box
of samples to the girls

39:45.490 --> 39:47.224
and Diane opened it, not me.

39:49.127 --> 39:50.761
I'll be right in.

39:53.597 --> 39:55.631
Everyone out!

39:56.800 --> 39:57.968
She'll be right in.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.737
This shouldn't be in here.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.774
What the hell is this?

40:04.808 --> 40:07.043
I guess Avon's serious.

40:07.078 --> 40:08.878
Oh, they're serious.

40:08.912 --> 40:11.480
When the hell did you have
a "productive breakfast"?

40:12.748 --> 40:13.915
You and Peggy ditched me.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.750
Peggy didn't know.

40:15.785 --> 40:18.020
There was some confusion
and then it was too late

40:18.054 --> 40:19.421
and I thought since
I mixed things up--

40:19.456 --> 40:20.922
There was no confusion.

40:22.625 --> 40:25.126
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I bet you are.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.428
Were you coming in here to
celebrate what a fool I am?

40:27.463 --> 40:29.563
You upset the girls. They
have nothing to do with this.

40:29.598 --> 40:31.466
So, you opening up
your own agency?

40:31.500 --> 40:33.201
Ted assigned her.

40:33.235 --> 40:35.470
Isn't the point
that Avon's happy?

40:35.504 --> 40:37.571
Oh, I bet you're
making him very happy.

40:37.606 --> 40:40.041
Because it's better
than being screwed by you.

40:40.075 --> 40:42.809
We'll see what Ted
has to say about this.

40:48.316 --> 40:50.017
Let me handle Ted.

40:50.051 --> 40:51.918
It's too late for that.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.831
- Ask her. - Did you meet with
Avon and not invite Pete?

41:05.865 --> 41:07.133
It was very
last-minute.

41:07.167 --> 41:08.901
Peggy, this doesn't
concern you.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.486
<i>This is unacceptable</i>

41:28.521 --> 41:30.854
<i>and I'd like to know what you
have to say for yourself.</i>

41:30.888 --> 41:33.590
- Does this color look good on me?
- Shh!

41:33.624 --> 41:35.825
What would you like
for me to say?

41:35.860 --> 41:38.695
Joan, you of all people
can't plead ignorance.

41:38.729 --> 41:41.031
She's going to say something
about <i>her</i> client

41:41.066 --> 41:43.033
and <i>her</i> connection.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.168
And, honestly, I take
no issue with that.

41:45.202 --> 41:48.671
But what we have here is a breach of the
fundamental rules of this business.

41:48.705 --> 41:51.174
<i>An account executive</i>
<i>signs business</i>

41:51.208 --> 41:54.477
and they send their junior
to maintain it.

41:54.511 --> 41:57.580
To maintain their boss's
relationship.

41:58.882 --> 42:00.950
The entire thing falls apart

42:00.984 --> 42:03.085
if I send you
to the store to get cake

42:03.119 --> 42:06.488
and you eat it on the way home.

42:06.522 --> 42:09.724
Did you really try
to squeeze him out?

42:14.997 --> 42:18.031
<i>You have nothing
to say for yourself?</i>

42:18.066 --> 42:19.567
It's a revolt.

42:22.837 --> 42:24.905
- Excuse me.
- Meredith, not now.

42:25.907 --> 42:29.376
"Joan, Andrew Hayes from Avon

42:29.411 --> 42:31.678
is on the phone
for you."

42:32.947 --> 42:35.482
Oh, it just gets better.

42:36.717 --> 42:39.085
What are you waiting for?
Go take it.

42:45.759 --> 42:48.628
<i>- That's it?</i>
- Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

42:48.662 --> 42:50.962
Only where there is no law.

42:50.997 --> 42:53.165
Pete! We're all
working together.

42:53.233 --> 42:55.467
All agency business
is your business.

43:01.007 --> 43:03.342
Thank you.

43:11.350 --> 43:13.551
You better hope
he really calls.

43:24.928 --> 43:27.130
Welcome back.
How was your trip?

43:27.165 --> 43:29.065
If you don't mind,
this is urgent.

43:29.099 --> 43:31.034
Aren't you glad you
didn't go straight home?

43:41.211 --> 43:44.380
I have to tell you that in your
absence, things have become quite dire.

43:44.414 --> 43:47.182
<i>Mr. Draper, the partners are here.</i>

43:47.216 --> 43:49.551
Come in.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.120
Welcome back.
How was California?

43:52.155 --> 43:55.157
It was a series of busts
and not the kind I like.

43:55.191 --> 43:57.625
Well, we have a bit
of news concerning the firm.

43:57.660 --> 44:00.195
- We should get Joan.
- No.

44:00.229 --> 44:03.030
- Anyone else?
- No, thank you.

44:03.065 --> 44:05.132
My visit to Detroit
was a success.

44:05.167 --> 44:07.702
<i>They finally signed off</i>
<i>on the strategy.</i>

44:07.736 --> 44:08.869
Even showed me
a model of the car.

44:08.904 --> 44:11.471
That's a relief.
Good work.

44:11.506 --> 44:14.575
Also, Joan's at the five-yard
line with Avon Cosmetics.

44:14.609 --> 44:15.743
Joan?

44:15.777 --> 44:18.411
Well, well, well.
While the cat's away...

44:18.445 --> 44:22.716
Unfortunately, Manischewitz
has put us in review.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.317
Ah, it's been coming
for months.

44:24.351 --> 44:26.352
But that's not what
we're here to talk about.

44:26.386 --> 44:29.923
We thought long and hard about what it's
gonna take to make this agency stable.

44:29.957 --> 44:33.592
I'd like to offer what we believe
to be a deferential solution.

44:33.626 --> 44:37.696
They want to call the agency
Sterling Cooper & Partners.

44:37.731 --> 44:40.465
Well, we know you like it.

44:40.499 --> 44:43.902
It would depend on Don, Jim,
and me all sharing the blow.

44:43.937 --> 44:45.337
You're willing to do that?

44:46.773 --> 44:50.174
It's the only thing that's
equally offensive to all.

44:53.045 --> 44:55.012
SC ampersand P.

44:55.047 --> 44:56.681
I can swallow it if you can.

44:56.716 --> 44:58.650
I don't think
I should weigh in on this.

44:58.684 --> 45:01.018
Good.
Then it's settled.

45:01.053 --> 45:02.587
I'll get the art
department on a logo.

45:09.327 --> 45:12.229
- Nice work.
- I had nothing to do with it.

45:12.264 --> 45:14.398
Have a good weekend.

45:17.736 --> 45:20.103
You have no problems with this?

45:20.138 --> 45:22.938
Pete, we're in the same
boat and I'm fine with it.

45:22.973 --> 45:26.075
Trust me, that name
is a consolation prize.

45:26.109 --> 45:28.244
It's a gravestone
to our resistance.

45:28.279 --> 45:30.212
You have no idea
what's going on out there.

45:30.247 --> 45:32.114
This is not
the same business anymore.

45:32.149 --> 45:35.318
If you don't like it, maybe it's
time to get out of the business.

45:41.691 --> 45:43.592
Dawn, could you get
my wife on the phone?

46:02.744 --> 46:04.478
What are you doing?

46:04.513 --> 46:06.380
Working.

46:06.415 --> 46:08.482
Give me that.

46:08.517 --> 46:10.249
