WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:07.639
- Yeah, all right.

00:07.641 --> 00:08.440
- Get up.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.242
- I'm moving.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.346
Lacks a little bit in here, huh.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.148
Hey, take it easy.

00:20.955 --> 00:21.955
All right.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.961
Jesus.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.563
- Do you like to
smoke, Mr. chase?

00:34.334 --> 00:35.501
- Some.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.336
- I love to smoke.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.606
It's one of life's
singular pleasures.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.679
But I'm gonna quit.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.214
You know why?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.150
- Because it's bad for you?

00:51.152 --> 00:52.152
- Bingo.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.921
When I find something's
been bad for me,

00:55.923 --> 00:58.490
I ask myself, is it worth it?

01:00.326 --> 01:03.495
Is it worth it to lose
a day, a week, a month,

01:03.497 --> 01:05.230
or years off my life?

01:06.499 --> 01:08.500
And I've decided it isn't.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.503
I wanna live a long time.

01:13.406 --> 01:17.409
But you don't seem
to share that desire.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.378
- I just need another week.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.213
- What good is that gonna do?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.581
- A lot can happen in a week.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.084
- Not for a guy like you.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.586
I deal with degenerate
gamblers all the time

01:27.588 --> 01:29.354
in my line of work.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.691
You know what I peg you for?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.493
A compulsive loser.

01:35.361 --> 01:39.031
And I'd guess that
just about sums you up.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.670
What about her?

01:51.945 --> 01:55.013
The world's a funny
place, isn't it?

01:56.249 --> 01:57.716
All kinds of people
come into your life

01:57.718 --> 02:00.385
for the strangest of reasons.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.553
Don't they?

02:02.956 --> 02:06.158
Today's your lucky
day, Mr. chase.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.893
You like cards?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.062
- I'm more of a
slots kind of guy.

02:10.064 --> 02:12.798
- That's pathetic.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.734
Oh, you should not
tell people that.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.736
- Okay.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.606
- High card wins.

02:20.608 --> 02:24.510
You get it, and I'll
cancel out your debt to me.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.646
I get it, and you're gonna
pay me double what you owe me.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.415
But I'll give you an extra week.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.151
- Uh.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.919
- Who are you kidding?

02:33.921 --> 02:38.190
I know you're gonna do it,
you know you're gonna do it.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.492
Cut the cards.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.528
- Travis came lookin' for you.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.530
- And what did you say?

03:19.666 --> 03:20.532
- What you think?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.833
Said I ain't seen you.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.835
Said maybe you in
big d or somethin'.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.305
- You know, you are
a prince, Lazarus.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.074
- The prince of
shreveport, that's me.

03:29.076 --> 03:32.477
Welcome to my fuckin' kingdom.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.146
What the hell are
you doing here, Max?

03:34.148 --> 03:37.149
You owe the man money,
and you a week late.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.684
- It's $3,000.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.819
I can pull that together,
that's no problem.

03:40.821 --> 03:45.657
- You ain't never had $3,000
at one time in your whole life.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.359
You shouldn't have
taken the bet, Max.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.660
- I know.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.495
And we ain't even talkin'
about your shitty goddamn luck,

03:50.497 --> 03:52.764
which most certainly is a thing.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.399
This is the man.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.767
Those cards were rigged.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.603
The man don't play unless
he know he's gonna win.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.403
- I know.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.371
I know, all right.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.373
I got it.

04:01.608 --> 04:05.544
So, you know of anybody
lookin' to crew up?

04:05.546 --> 04:08.447
- I find anybody who's lookin'
for a middle-aged thief

04:08.449 --> 04:11.683
who gets busted every time
he goes out to rob a joint,

04:11.685 --> 04:13.685
I'll give your ass a call.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.622
- Who's the redhead?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.957
- You got some fucked
up priorities, Max.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.559
You need to be drivin'
your ass outta town,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.527
not pickin' up women.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.796
- I have my priorities,
you have yours.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.999
Send over two more shots.

04:27.967 --> 04:28.967
- Dumbass.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.605
- You new in town?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.540
- What makes you think that?

04:35.542 --> 04:36.475
- Small town.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.876
- It's not that small.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.958
- It ain't big enough for
me to miss a girl like you.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.281
I'm Max.

04:42.283 --> 04:45.550
- One for Max, and one
for the new girl in town.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.718
- Amber Ann.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.453
I just moved here from longview.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.755
- Longview?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.758
Oh hell, this is a
big city, isn't it?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.330
- Wife or girlfriend?

04:58.332 --> 05:00.565
- Not married, no girlfriend.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.967
Sister.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.802
- Oh, she's cute.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.103
Looks like you.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.571
- She's checkin' in in me.

05:06.573 --> 05:07.773
She seems to be
under the impression

05:07.775 --> 05:09.408
that I make bad life decisions.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.676
- Really?

05:10.678 --> 05:13.312
- Aw hell yes, I'm
a troublemaker.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.147
My sister says so.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.582
Now, let's talk
about you, longview.

07:20.808 --> 07:21.808
- Hey.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.143
I said, you're late.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.580
Now, Mr. chase, if you
don't take this serious,

07:28.582 --> 07:31.750
I can bounce ya right back
to caddo correctional.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.419
- Are you like mardi
gras king or somethin'?

07:34.421 --> 07:36.388
- I was on the court
a few years back.

07:36.390 --> 07:39.558
- Is that like, an
elected position?

07:39.560 --> 07:43.395
- I don't see how that's
any of your business.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.065
Your guardian was
supposed to be here today.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.468
- She's not my guardian,
she's my sister.

07:49.470 --> 07:53.672
- She's your legal guardian
until I say she ain't.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.906
So where's she at?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.074
- How the hell should I know?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.809
- You're stayin'
with her, ain't ya?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.511
- That's what the judge said.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.646
- That's no kind of answer.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.248
- You know,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.850
I really like this coat.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.085
They let you keep that coat?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.824
Okay.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.858
Guys.

09:24.697 --> 09:25.597
Oh.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.999
Oh, oh, that's a bad attitude.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.803
- Man, get your stupid
ass back in the car.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.585
- You've reached
assistant district attorney,

09:46.587 --> 09:47.852
Isobel chase.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.054
I'm not available at the
moment, please leave a message.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.257
- Oh hi.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.758
Remember me?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.093
Remember that meeting we had

09:55.095 --> 09:57.629
with my douche bag parole
officer this morning?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.898
Oh no, you forgot, didn't you?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.466
That's all right.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.468
I'll just sit there and
get chewed out for an hour.

10:05.272 --> 10:09.074
Oh, perfect.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.797
You playin' hooky?

10:40.339 --> 10:41.339
Isobel?

10:52.752 --> 10:53.752
Iz?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.330
Iz?

11:41.367 --> 11:43.234
- 911, what's your emergency?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.904
- Counselor, this man
is a career criminal

11:45.906 --> 11:48.673
and a drug addict with
a history of violence.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.142
- I'm not a drug addict.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.144
- Shut up.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.482
Your honor, he wants
to make a clean start.

11:57.484 --> 12:01.219
And I'm asking that you
give him that chance.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.988
- I know your sister.

12:03.990 --> 12:07.358
I respect her, and I
consider her a friend.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.995
I've never met you, but
I've read your file.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.332
And in my estimation,
you're not worth a damn,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.435
and your sister will
regret this day.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.003
Let me be clear.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.006
Anything happens to her
while you are under her care,

12:22.008 --> 12:25.443
I will lock you up and
throw away the key.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.353
- That son of a bitch.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.889
You touch her again,
and I'm gonna kill you.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.190
You hear me?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.291
She shows up with a
bruise she can't explain,

12:40.293 --> 12:41.593
I'm gonna show up at this door,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.361
I'm gonna come into this
pretty boy apartment,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.196
and I'm gonna kick
the shit outta you.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.198
Do you hear me?

12:57.209 --> 12:58.243
- Shit!

12:59.045 --> 13:00.245
Wait a second.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.417
- What did you do the her, huh?

13:06.419 --> 13:07.786
Did you beat her up again?

13:07.788 --> 13:08.788
Isobel!

13:09.889 --> 13:11.089
- I haven't seen her in weeks.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.796
She spent the night at
your place two nights ago.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.963
- No.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.132
- I live with her, I know
she spent the night with you.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.200
- She left me.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.604
She left me for another
fuckin' guy, okay.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.606
- Who?

13:28.575 --> 13:29.841
- Get off him.

13:30.843 --> 13:31.843
Get off!

13:33.579 --> 13:36.080
- All right, all right.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.315
Take it easy, huh.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.484
- Don't move, asshole.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.219
I'm callin' the cops.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.157
Jo Jo, if he moves, shoot him.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.094
- Jo Jo, that your name?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.362
- Jody.
- Jody.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.132
Is this guy your
boyfriend, Jody?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.467
Because this guy is my
kid sister's boyfriend.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.869
- Shut up.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.938
Yeah, a guy just broke
into my apartment

13:59.940 --> 14:01.306
and assaulted me.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.874
- He beat you up yet?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.876
- He wouldn't do that.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.278
- You beat all hell outta
me kid sister, didn't ya?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.113
- Stop talking to her.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.383
- You can't trust this guy.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.352
Were you with him
two nights ago?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.153
- Yeah.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.355
No, I captured him.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.691
7894 youree drive extension.

14:19.693 --> 14:23.261
- I've been with him
every night this week.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.698
- You gotta get rid
of this guy, Jody.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.899
He's an asshole.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.700
- No, no, no.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.534
Don't, don't.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.236
Goddamnit, jojo.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.037
- That son of a
bitch, I swear to god.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.340
- Don't do anything to him.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.175
- What do you care?

14:37.177 --> 14:40.311
- 'Cause I don't wanna have
to prepare a murder defense.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.579
It's not my specialty.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.881
- Yeah, well, I want kill him.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.016
That's all I'll say.
- Don't hurt him.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.584
You're on parole.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.486
If you do anything...

14:48.488 --> 14:49.554
- you know, I don't
think you're done

14:49.556 --> 14:51.389
with this son of a bitch at all.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.657
I think as soon as this heals,

14:52.659 --> 14:53.558
you'll be right over there to...

14:53.560 --> 14:54.726
- I'm done.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.262
It's just more
complicated than that.

14:57.264 --> 15:01.532
- If you go back with this
guy, he's gonna kill you.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.368
- Be dramatic, why don't you.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.402
- No, I'm serious, okay.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.504
It won't be on purpose,
it'll be an accident.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.106
He'll get jealous or drunk.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.341
But he will kill you.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.443
And then I gotta kill him.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.380
And you're dead, so I gotta
find myself a real lawyer.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.117
And you know I can't
afford that shit.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.140
- Max, it's me.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.708
Where are you?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.410
I need to,

15:45.412 --> 15:47.211
I'm in some trouble,
and I need you to...

15:47.213 --> 15:48.780
- It's okay.
- Hey there, boy-o.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.981
- Hey Travis.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.418
Come on in, make
yourself at home.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.220
- This is a real shit-hole you
got here, you know that, Max?

15:56.222 --> 15:59.057
- Yeah, I'm dealin' with some
familial strife right now.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.325
- So it seems.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.428
Got a temper, do you?

16:03.430 --> 16:04.228
- I didn't do that.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.263
Look, forget it.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.564
Can I just get my
phone back, please?

16:06.566 --> 16:09.434
- Hmm, you know, I
don't think this works.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.735
I've been tryin' to call you

16:10.737 --> 16:11.569
for like a week.
- Look, I'm sorry.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.837
I just...

16:12.839 --> 16:15.073
Oh, goddamnit, you
break my phone?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.076
All right, look,

16:18.078 --> 16:21.279
I am dealing with a situation
with my sister right now.

16:22.916 --> 16:23.916
You okay?

16:26.251 --> 16:27.752
- No, I'm not okay.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.456
I'm not o fuckin' k, Max.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.994
I have a bad tooth.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.429
It hurts.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.264
- You should see a dentist.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.300
- Yeah, no shit.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.703
This might come as a
bit of a shock to you,

16:45.705 --> 16:48.606
but I don't need your
dumb-ass medical advice.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.676
And I don't need to hear
about your family problems.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.711
I want the money
that you owe the man.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.347
Now.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.016
- I don't have it.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.884
- What a fuckin' shock.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.319
Of course you don't,
that's why I'm here.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.888
Well, now you know what happens.

17:03.890 --> 17:04.821
Now I hurt you.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.023
- Wait, wait, I can get it.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.125
I can get it.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.492
Whoa, whoa.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.862
- You know, I was just gonna
cut up your face real good

17:10.864 --> 17:13.330
so your dumb-ass friends
could see what it was like

17:13.333 --> 17:14.665
when you owe money to the man.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.134
But

17:16.136 --> 17:20.204
I don't like you, Max.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.046
- Well, maybe I could
buy you a beer some time.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.144
- You're smug.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.516
You think you're smarter
than everybody else.

17:31.518 --> 17:35.586
You're a wise-ass,
and I don't like that.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.723
I know, I cut up your face,

17:38.725 --> 17:40.491
you're gonna come
back to the man again,

17:40.493 --> 17:41.559
you're gonna borrow money again,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.227
you're gonna lose it
at the boats again,

17:43.229 --> 17:46.164
and we're gonna have to do
this same dance all over.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.598
So,

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
I think

17:51.404 --> 17:53.504
I'm gonna cut off your thumb.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.840
Life's gonna be pretty
difficult without thumbs.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.243
You know, that's what separates
us from the other animals.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.512
- I just need a
little more time.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.413
No, no!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.181
Don't do it, don't do it!

18:03.183 --> 18:04.549
I can get you the money!

18:04.551 --> 18:05.917
- You ain't got it now, you
ain't never gonna have it.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.919
Three grand to you is
like a million dollars.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.554
- From my sister.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.455
My sister, man.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.255
She's got money.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.056
A lot of it.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.524
She's a fuckin' lawyer.

18:13.526 --> 18:17.295
If I can find her, she
can square everything.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.100
- A lawyer, huh?

18:23.569 --> 18:24.435
Yeah.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.938
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.473
But that's an extra thousand.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.440
- What for?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.442
- For keepin' your thumbs.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.311
Off the books, for me.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.247
- Yeah, okay.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.249
- 24 hours.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.550
You drop the cash
off at the club.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.719
Keep 'em separate, and
that's just between us.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.321
Do you hear me?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.323
Yeah.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.958
- This is it, Max.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.294
You just cashed
in your last chip.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.497
You don't show, I'm
gonna hunt you down,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.632
and I'm gonna gut you.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.278
- Max, it's me.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.913
Where are you?

19:08.915 --> 19:10.581
I need to,

19:10.583 --> 19:12.950
I'm in some trouble,
and I need you to,

19:12.952 --> 19:15.486
I don't know who else to call.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.455
Where are you?

19:26.265 --> 19:27.365
You are unbelievable.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.699
- Sorry.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.301
- Sorry?

19:30.303 --> 19:31.602
What would you have done

19:31.604 --> 19:32.503
if I didn't know the
arresting officer?

19:32.505 --> 19:33.771
You would be going back to jail.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.672
Is that what you want?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.973
- That's not what I want.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.508
- Oh, so you just
wanna ruin my life.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.876
- All right, look, it
wasn't even my fault, okay.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.444
- You were carrying drugs.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.380
- Not drugs, pot.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.282
Jesus, what do you want from me?

19:44.284 --> 19:46.017
Thank you, I'm sorry.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.618
I'd do the same
for you, you know.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.519
- Would you, I wonder.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.487
- Oh, well, see, that's fucked.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.454
- I can't do this anymore.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.622
- Do what?
- Save you.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.690
- Then stop.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.361
Just leave me in there to rot
if that's what you wanna do.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.197
- We are all we've got.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.865
You, me, and cotton.

20:02.367 --> 20:07.071
And god knows you can't count
him if you're in trouble.

20:08.474 --> 20:09.474
- Cotton.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.014
- You.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.051
I hope you're not here
lookin' for a handout.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.387
- I haven't asked you for
money in 20 goddamn years.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.555
- Well, I don't got any.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.023
And if I did, I
wouldn't give it to you.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.558
I ain't runnin' no
charity business.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.227
- I don't want any money.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.561
- Yeah, well,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.697
it'd just be good money
after bad at this point.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.764
- Will you just stop talking?

20:33.766 --> 20:34.899
Just shut up, okay.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.435
I don't want anything from you.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.003
- I forgot, I'm sorry.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.105
I'm father of the year.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.506
That's why my lovely children

20:42.508 --> 20:46.110
are suddenly so
concerned about me, hmm.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.879
You and that other one
showin' up outta the blue.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.716
But you don't want
nothin', no, no.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.584
- Wait, Isobel's been here?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.619
When?

20:54.621 --> 20:55.586
What did she say?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.554
- Ya'll in a fight or somethin'?

20:56.556 --> 20:58.689
- When was she here?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.758
- Thought you two
were thick as thieves.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.461
- Look, you want me
to go, I wanna leave.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.896
Just answer my question so I
can get the hell outta here.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.698
- Ah, she came by last night.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.567
10, 11 o'clock.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.935
- What did she want?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.738
- To spend the night if
you can believe that shit.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.706
- And you didn't let her?

21:15.708 --> 21:19.644
- This look like a
goddamn motel 6 to you?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.646
- Your daughter drives
all the way out here

21:21.648 --> 21:23.214
in the middle of the night

21:23.216 --> 21:26.917
to ask if she can stay
with you in this shit-hole,

21:26.919 --> 21:28.586
and you don't ask her why?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.654
- Didn't occur to me.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.989
- It didn't occur to you
she might be in trouble?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.958
You turned her away the first
time she asked for anything?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.327
- I did not turn her away.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.995
She got a call
from her boyfriend.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.997
Went to spend the
night with him.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.966
So, how's that, officer?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.134
Hmm?

21:43.136 --> 21:44.435
- No.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.336
No, no, I talked
to the boyfriend.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.804
She didn't stay with him.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.639
- Well, maybe you don't know
her goddamn social calendar

21:48.641 --> 21:50.608
like you think you do, huh?

21:50.610 --> 21:51.942
- Well, what does that mean?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.311
Did she say it was her
boyfriend or didn't she?

21:53.313 --> 21:54.779
- She didn't say.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.846
I could tell.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.748
She was all pissy
mad when he called.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.284
Mad 'cause he hadn't
called earlier, huh.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.620
Yeah, I've seen it all my life.

22:02.622 --> 22:06.057
I know when a woman
is naggin' on her man.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.730
What did you do?

22:14.666 --> 22:15.633
- Me?

22:15.635 --> 22:17.601
- You remember
that dog she found?

22:17.603 --> 22:19.670
The blue heeler?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.539
Mangy, all scarred up.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.142
Some farmer shot it 'cause
it was chasin' his cows.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.711
What was she, five?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.212
- She was eight.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.316
- Well, she brought it
inside, and she fed it.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.453
Tried to bandage it, got blood
all over the goddamn place.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.721
- Yeah, I know this story.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.189
- So what happens?

22:39.491 --> 22:41.225
- It bit her.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.160
You killed it.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.362
She cried for a week.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.300
- That dog, that's you.

22:51.503 --> 22:55.206
Only I can't put you
down like I did that dog.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.375
You keep comin' back,
wantin' to get bandaged,

22:57.377 --> 22:59.643
and she keeps gettin' bit.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.815
If she's in trouble now,
it's probably because of you.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.916
- Me?

23:06.752 --> 23:08.052
Not her deadbeat father,

23:08.054 --> 23:11.322
who turned her away the first
time she asked for help?

23:11.324 --> 23:13.657
- Get the hell outta my house,
you worthless son of a bitch.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.993
- Always a pleasure
seeing you, cotton.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.828
- Go to hell.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.877
- Hey.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.678
- Excuse me, sir,
can I help you?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.747
- Probably not.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.249
You know where Isobel chase is?

23:38.251 --> 23:40.384
- Miss chase is out
of the office today.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.886
- Is this it?

23:41.888 --> 23:42.686
This is her office, right?
- Sir, excuse me.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.189
You cannot be in here.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.223
- I don't suppose
she spent the night

23:46.225 --> 23:48.426
at your place last night?

23:49.694 --> 23:51.061
Nah.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.264
Your friend, you know
who she's sleepin' with?

23:53.266 --> 23:54.865
- Carla, call security.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.800
- All right, don't
get hysterical.

23:55.802 --> 23:56.734
I'm her brother, all right.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.068
I'm just lookin' for her.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.590
- And how do I know
you're her brother?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.677
- Stephen, I got this.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.414
Hello Max.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.849
I'm Paul melancon.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.051
Is Isobel feeling all right?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.921
She's never missed a
day without calling.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.422
She had a meeting scheduled and,

24:18.424 --> 24:19.790
is she all right?

24:21.393 --> 24:24.895
- It's funny, she
never talks about you.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.263
That's weird, isn't it?

24:26.265 --> 24:28.933
The district attorney from
all the TV commercials,

24:28.935 --> 24:30.935
and you never come up.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.137
How long you been her
boss, how many years?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.405
- Four.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.806
- Four.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.942
Four years workin'
with somebody who,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.410
and excuse me for sayin' so,

24:39.412 --> 24:42.012
is a damn handsome man,

24:42.014 --> 24:43.581
but you're never mentioned.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.983
You never come up
in conversation.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.918
It's almost like
it's on purpose.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.653
- That is funny.

24:49.655 --> 24:52.156
'Cause I know all
about you, Max.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.792
Grand Theft Auto, larceny.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.862
- I like it when you
use the big words.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.363
- Your sister
putting her career,

24:59.365 --> 25:00.865
in fact, this entire office,

25:00.867 --> 25:02.800
on the line by vouching for you.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.768
Yeah, you've been
discussed a great deal.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.872
- You know where my sister is?

25:07.874 --> 25:09.807
- At home sick, isn't she?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.809
- Did you call her last night?

25:11.811 --> 25:13.344
- No.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.812
- Did you sleep at
home last night?

25:14.814 --> 25:15.946
- You know, I'm
really not interested

25:15.948 --> 25:18.616
in being interrogated by you.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.451
- Yeah, I hate it too.

25:21.953 --> 25:24.622
You sleepin' with my
sister, counselor?

25:24.624 --> 25:26.190
- This discussion is over.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.158
- Now look, Isobel is
missing, all right.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.394
I think she's in trouble,
and I need to find her.

25:30.396 --> 25:31.962
Soon.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.031
- What makes you think
something's happened to her?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.833
- She was scared.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.568
Her place is wrecked.

25:38.803 --> 25:41.138
- Oh Jesus.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.141
- What do I need
to know, counselor?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.543
- She was,

25:45.545 --> 25:47.811
we're working on a big case.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.014
- Who you goin' after?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.615
- John Mansfield.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.887
You know who he is?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.156
- Everybody knows the man.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.159
You get my sister
involved in this?

26:02.161 --> 26:03.060
- It's her job.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.995
She's workin' with the witness.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.263
- Okay.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.998
Okay, I wanna talk
to that witness.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.668
- You want me just to introduce
you to the key witness

26:10.670 --> 26:13.571
against the city's most
powerful crime boss?

26:13.573 --> 26:14.872
Doesn't work that way, son.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.274
- Look, you know the man.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.877
You know what he's capable of.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.413
If she's disappeared
because of him,

26:22.415 --> 26:23.415
she's dead.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.216
Or soon will be.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.785
If you care about her at all,

26:27.787 --> 26:31.355
you gotta let me
talk to that witness.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.257
- What if you work for the man?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.059
What if this whole
thing about Isobel

26:35.061 --> 26:37.995
is a tactic to get
my witness killed?

26:42.968 --> 26:45.369
No, I'll talk to my
witness about this.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.739
And then I'll get back with
you when I find out something.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.941
That's the best I can do.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.025
- What the hell is this?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.593
- Just movin' you
as a precaution.

27:42.595 --> 27:43.927
This is a safe
house the police use

27:43.929 --> 27:45.996
to protect witnesses sometimes.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.531
- Biggest case of your career,

27:47.533 --> 27:50.934
and you stick me in a
crack house on skid row?

27:50.936 --> 27:52.202
Classy.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.371
- Well, look on the
bright side, miss Barnes.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.374
No one's gonna
look for you here.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.010
- Step inside, miss Barnes.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.746
- I wanna know what's goin' on.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.492
You know, you can't keep
me locked up like this.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.161
- Yes, I can.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.897
It's only 'til
trial, miss Barnes.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.166
- And when the hell is that.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.033
- Thursday.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.169
- That's four days away.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.071
You can't keep me in here.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.339
I got shit I got to attend to.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.141
- Oh yeah, like what?

28:31.143 --> 28:34.244
- Like none o' your business.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.913
- You know, you will testify.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.182
Or I'll throw your ass in
jail for drug trafficking.

28:39.518 --> 28:43.020
- I told you, I just
delivered a package.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.321
- I'm sorry, miss Barnes,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.757
but I don't think a
jury's gonna buy that.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.159
If you pull any shit on that
stand, you will go to prison.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.662
I promise you that.

28:51.664 --> 28:53.831
- I ain't sharin'
this room with them.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.566
- They'll be outside.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.904
Oh.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.873
One more thing.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.042
Have you hear from Isobel?

29:05.044 --> 29:07.177
- I've already gone
over my testimony.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.613
Again, and again, and again.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.548
- So you didn't work
with her yesterday?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.616
- No.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.718
She didn't show up.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.188
But I'm fine, I don't
need to practice.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.992
- All right, just makin'
sure you're ready.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.095
All right.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.597
Keep your eyes open.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.433
One of my adas may or
may not be missing.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.367
It may be something, nothing,

29:30.369 --> 29:31.969
or someone's idea of a bad joke.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.971
But I'm not taking any chances.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.874
If the man's making a move,
he wants this girl dead.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.116
You understand what I'm saying?

29:38.911 --> 29:40.177
Keep her safe.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.700
- Hey.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.168
Can I talk to you for a second?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.703
I think we can help each other.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.038
- I ain't a pro, asshole.
- No, not like that.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.139
Hold on a second, okay.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.041
I need to ask you
about Isobel chase.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.943
You know her?

30:45.945 --> 30:48.111
- Yeah, she's kinda my lawyer.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.613
She okay?

30:49.615 --> 30:51.381
- Why you ask that?

31:01.025 --> 31:02.559
- The man don't understand,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.628
I ain't sayin'
nothin' to the feds.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.030
- I don't work for the man.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.300
Whoa, Jesus.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.237
Wait, wait.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.138
I'm Isobel chase's
brother, okay.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.139
I'm lookin' to find her.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.609
I'm not lookin' to hurt you.

31:20.578 --> 31:23.914
- You're Izzy's brother?

31:25.150 --> 31:26.416
Well, no shit.

31:27.585 --> 31:30.254
You know, you look
like her a little bit.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.688
- Huh.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.390
- There are certain people
who would be very happy

31:33.392 --> 31:35.259
if I disappeared.

31:35.261 --> 31:39.529
If the man was after you,
you would swing first too.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.099
- When was the last
time you saw her?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.267
- Izzy?

31:43.269 --> 31:44.668
Two days ago.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.403
- And what'd you talk about?

31:46.405 --> 31:47.871
- You know, my case.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.806
- So, come on, tell me.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.043
- I got busted with 40 grand.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.611
The cops wanted to know
where it came from.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.014
- Yeah, they're funny that way.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.116
So where did it come from?

31:59.118 --> 32:00.617
- You ever heard
of central station?

32:00.619 --> 32:02.219
- Uh, the gay club?

32:02.221 --> 32:05.222
- The man runs his
operation out of there.

32:05.224 --> 32:08.959
Sometimes I'd make a
delivery for some extra cash.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.261
I didn't ask what was in the
bags, and he didn't tell me.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.897
- And you get pinched on
the way to the drop-off.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.233
It's a dumb business
to get involved in.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.303
- Some guys you don't say no to.

32:19.305 --> 32:23.073
- The man asked you
to do it, directly?

32:23.075 --> 32:26.376
So you can testify to him
actually commitin' a crime.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.245
- Pretty stupid, right?

32:28.247 --> 32:30.314
- And then Isobel disappears.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.616
- You think they hurt her?

32:34.218 --> 32:35.218
Let go of me.
- No.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.453
You listen to me.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.422
If the man does have
Isobel, and you testify,

32:38.424 --> 32:39.790
they're gonna kill
her and then you.

32:39.792 --> 32:40.891
Is that what you want?

32:40.893 --> 32:42.492
- Get your fuckin' hands off me.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.464
- Lazarus, so how's biz?

32:47.466 --> 32:48.732
- Oh hell, I could complain,

32:48.734 --> 32:50.434
but nobody wanna
hear that bullshit.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.335
Can I get you a beer?

32:51.337 --> 32:52.337
- Hell yeah.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.279
- You know, that cop was probably
lookin' for you in there.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.481
- They ain't even gonna know
I'm gone until tomorrow.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.749
- You don't know that.

33:05.751 --> 33:06.516
And what do you got?

33:06.518 --> 33:07.317
You don't got nothin'.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.952
You don't got a car.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.421
The man is after you, and
tomorrow, shreveport pd.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.457
Or you can get in
my truck with me,

33:13.459 --> 33:15.125
and we can get outta here.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.460
- Well, ain't you
the good samaritan.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.129
- Enough, it ain't charity.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.367
- So what do you want?

33:23.369 --> 33:26.236
- All you gotta
do is not testify.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.772
- The man already
thinks I turned on him.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.474
- I'll clear it with him.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.042
You gone clear it?

33:32.044 --> 33:33.276
With the man?
- Look,

33:33.278 --> 33:34.311
you let me worry
about that, all right.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.346
All you gotta do is
keep your mouth shut,

33:36.348 --> 33:39.016
and I get my little sister back.

33:41.219 --> 33:45.522
Look, that cop isn't gonna
stay in there all night.

33:46.624 --> 33:47.624
- Fine.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.558
Let's go.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.826
- All right.

33:49.828 --> 33:50.560
We need a place for
you to hide out.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.495
My place is no good.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.396
- I got one.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.398
Get on I-20.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.190
- Nice digs.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.492
Whose place?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.393
- Just some guy I used to know.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.495
- Can you trust him?

34:25.496 --> 34:26.763
- He's gone.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.398
Workin' in Dallas for
the next few months.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.100
- That his truck, too?

34:30.101 --> 34:32.536
- Don't worry, he ain't
comin' back anytime soon.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.170
No one'll find me here.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.505
- All right.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.540
Well, I'll reach out to the man.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.609
I'll tell him you
are not testifying.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.379
And try to get Isobel back.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.181
- How do I know you
ain't gonna rat me out?

34:45.184 --> 34:46.683
- I ain't.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.552
- So, what, I just trust you?

34:48.554 --> 34:50.786
- You got any other options?

34:52.223 --> 34:55.391
- Will you tell him I
didn't mean nothin' by it?

34:55.393 --> 34:57.928
I wasn't gonna go
through with it.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.362
- Yeah, I'll tell him.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.081
- You're reached
assistant district attorney

35:18.083 --> 35:19.282
Isobel chase.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.924
I'm not available,
please leave a message.

35:24.489 --> 35:25.989
- Hey, it's Max.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.459
Yeah, I know Travis
is lookin' for me.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.461
Look.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.063
I need to see the man.

35:33.065 --> 35:35.432
Tell him I got
somethin' he wants.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.568
Somethin' from New Orleans.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.904
And I'm willin' to make a trade.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.439
- Are you happy with yourself?

35:42.441 --> 35:44.241
- Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.610
- Well, then stop
acting like one.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.278
You take advantage of people.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.447
You lie and you steal.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.149
- What'd they ever do for me?

35:52.151 --> 35:53.450
Nothing.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.418
- What have they
ever done to you?

35:55.420 --> 35:56.420
- Plenty.

35:57.421 --> 35:58.588
- You.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.157
- What do you want from me?

36:00.159 --> 36:04.161
- I want you to be the
man I know you can be.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.163
A good man.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.100
- Shit.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.215
Hey Max, why don't ya come
out into the middle of nowhere

36:25.217 --> 36:26.016
in the dead of night.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.485
We'll have a meeting.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.453
Fantastic, let's do it.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.458
What could possibly go wrong?

36:35.460 --> 36:36.460
Idiot.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.367
- What's up, Max?

36:44.369 --> 36:45.802
- What's up, Cade?

36:47.471 --> 36:50.073
Nice car.

36:50.075 --> 36:51.508
Nice suit.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.577
- Drivin' for the man now.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.645
Says he wants us to look
presentable and shit.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.547
I feel like a fuckin' banker.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.515
- Nah, you look good.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.316
- Yeah?

36:59.318 --> 37:00.483
Hell, I'll take it.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.551
I gotta search you.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.719
Nothin' personal.
- Yep.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.221
How's the family?

37:04.223 --> 37:07.524
- Karen's
bein' a pain in my ass.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.658
- How come?

37:08.660 --> 37:09.893
- The hours.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.062
She's thinks I'm
fuckin' around and shit.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.496
- Are you?

37:13.498 --> 37:14.831
- Not that she would know.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.900
- They got a sixth sense
about that stuff, you know.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.401
- Yeah, I guess.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.238
Are you goin' to the reunion?

37:21.240 --> 37:22.539
- No.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.407
- You should go, man,
everybody's gonna be there.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.575
Karen really wants to go.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.943
Tickets are 50 bucks.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.078
- What?
- Each.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.679
- Fuck that.
- That's what I said.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.181
But she really wants to go.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.282
You should try and come.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.283
- When is it?

37:33.285 --> 37:35.252
- Uh, October, I think.

37:36.721 --> 37:39.189
- It's a little
dramatic, isn't it?

37:39.191 --> 37:41.791
- The man's kind of dramatic.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.860
- October, huh?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.395
Tell you what,

37:45.397 --> 37:47.063
if I live through tonight,
I'll see you there.

37:47.065 --> 37:47.864
- Yeah?

37:47.866 --> 37:48.765
- Yeah.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.134
It's 50 bucks, right?

37:51.136 --> 37:52.302
See you later, Cade.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.937
- See you around, Max.

38:25.270 --> 38:28.238
- Am I to assume
you have my money?

38:28.240 --> 38:31.007
You could have given
it to Travis, you know.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.510
He was out lookin'
for you all day.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.779
It would have made
him feel useful.

38:35.781 --> 38:38.281
- What I've got to
say ain't about that.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.616
- Of course not.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.786
It's about new
Orleans, am I right?

38:42.788 --> 38:44.754
- Nola Barnes.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.290
- Oh, I'd like to have
a conversation with her.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.658
- What about my sister?

38:48.660 --> 38:49.959
Isobel chase.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.528
Do you have her?

38:51.530 --> 38:55.165
- You said on the phone
you wanted to make a trade.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.900
So where Nola Barnes?

38:59.370 --> 39:00.370
She's,

39:01.472 --> 39:02.372
the thing is that...

39:02.374 --> 39:03.374
- where?

39:05.676 --> 39:08.111
- She's gone, she left town.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.513
She ain't testifyin' to
nobody about nothin'.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.681
I promise you that, sir.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.617
- Let me tell you
about Nola Barnes.

39:14.619 --> 39:18.688
She would do anything,
say anything, to survive.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.058
- Is my sister alive?

39:22.060 --> 39:25.061
- How the fuck should I know?

39:25.063 --> 39:26.696
You know, it's funny.

39:26.698 --> 39:30.033
I get accused of every crime
that happens in the arklatex.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.035
Travis.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.639
- Nothin' personal, Max.

39:39.644 --> 39:40.877
- I had to get out of my bed.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.045
- Yes, sir.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.814
- Come to the middle of nowhere.

39:44.816 --> 39:45.982
- Yes, sir.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.756
- And after all of that,
where is Nola Barnes?

39:54.492 --> 39:55.392
- I don't know, sir.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.227
- You don't know?

39:57.229 --> 40:01.097
Three days before she
testifies, and you don't know?

40:01.099 --> 40:03.199
I am so disappointed
in you, Travis.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.768
Very disappointed.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.935
- Yes, sir.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.575
- Yeah, and we got Mr. honey
slots, Mr. $3,000 and counting,

40:12.577 --> 40:14.010
he thinks she left town.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.879
- Well, you know,

40:15.881 --> 40:17.414
I bet he's right.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.683
She's too smart to
testify against you.

40:20.685 --> 40:23.019
- I wish I had your confidence.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.790
- Get up, get up.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.526
- We're gonna need to
take care of the da.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.860
No way around it.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.798
I'm gonna go home.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.500
Finish a bottle of chardonnay.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.138
- Wait!

40:42.140 --> 40:43.106
Wait.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.542
- You wanted to be an option.

40:46.877 --> 40:49.212
What little luck
you had is used up.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.914
House wins, always wins.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.383
- My sister.

40:53.385 --> 40:55.218
- I'm so sick of this guy.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.886
His sister again.

40:56.888 --> 41:01.124
His debt is not worth what
it would cost to collect it.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.096
- Max?

41:08.466 --> 41:09.466
Max.

41:10.768 --> 41:11.868
Max!

41:13.737 --> 41:15.171
They're gonna kill you!

41:16.741 --> 41:17.941
- I wish shockley's was open.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.909
They have the best catfish.

41:19.911 --> 41:20.944
- They ain't open.

41:20.946 --> 41:21.744
- I know.

41:21.746 --> 41:22.912
I'm just sayin'.

41:22.914 --> 41:23.813
Catfish.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.949
- Wakey, wakey, sweetheart.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.818
- Oh shit.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.588
Okay, okay.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.458
I think you broke my nose.

41:35.460 --> 41:36.259
- Does it hurt?

41:36.261 --> 41:37.927
Fuck you.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.329
- You told me I had 'til tomorrow
to get your money, Travis.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.364
You remember that conversation,
like six hours ago?

41:41.366 --> 41:42.365
- You had that time.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.666
Had it.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.968
This ain't about
the money no more.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.870
- Yeah, you went
over Travis's head.

41:46.872 --> 41:47.871
- Not cool.

41:47.873 --> 41:48.838
- You ask for a
meeting with the man,

41:48.840 --> 41:49.806
and you don't think with me?

41:49.808 --> 41:50.773
That makes me look bad.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.442
I don't like lookin' bad.

41:52.444 --> 41:55.178
- All right, this is just one
big misunderstanding, boys.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.679
- Get his wallet.

42:02.052 --> 42:03.052
- $3.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.122
That's not even gas money.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.056
- Dib.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.058
- Shut up.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.960
All right, get him on his knees.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.897
- All right.

42:13.899 --> 42:14.899
Wait, wait.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.801
I told you, I told the man,

42:18.803 --> 42:20.970
my sister is missing, okay.

42:20.972 --> 42:24.374
If she's in trouble
and you kill me,

42:24.376 --> 42:26.376
nobody's gonna help her.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.844
- Well, she's dead.

42:29.814 --> 42:30.814
- What?

42:31.382 --> 42:32.749
- You heard me.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.151
- You killed her?

42:35.153 --> 42:36.085
Why?

42:36.087 --> 42:38.254
She never did nothin'.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.057
- We had nothin' to do with it.

42:42.426 --> 42:43.893
- Who?

42:43.895 --> 42:45.762
- Doesn't matter now.

42:45.764 --> 42:47.196
- Tell me.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.531
Please.

42:48.533 --> 42:49.832
- Travis.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.435
Go ahead and blast
this fool away.

42:52.437 --> 42:53.870
- All right, look, look.

42:53.872 --> 42:58.441
All right, you tell me
who killed my sister,

42:58.443 --> 43:00.877
I'll tell you where Nola
Barnes is hidin' out.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.645
- I thought she skipped town.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.619
Your sister had
nothin' to do with us.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.554
Oldest reason in the
world to get clipped,

43:11.556 --> 43:12.855
run of the mill jealousy.

43:12.857 --> 43:16.492
She just fucked the
wrong person, that's all.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.362
I'm sorry for your loss.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.431
Now where's Nola Barnes?

43:25.135 --> 43:26.202
- She's, uh,

43:27.738 --> 43:30.239
hidin' in a farmhouse
outside of town.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.742
On the Texas border.

43:32.744 --> 43:33.776
I'll take you there.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.078
- No, no, no.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.112
Now, that's not
part of our deal.

43:36.114 --> 43:39.048
- I don't know
her address, trav.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.116
I've been there.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.517
I can show you.

43:45.223 --> 43:47.056
- Get him in the car.

43:47.058 --> 43:47.824
- Shit.

43:47.826 --> 43:48.992
Goin' to Texas, trav?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.093
- Look, Travis,

43:50.095 --> 43:50.994
the man said bring him
out here and kill him.

43:50.996 --> 43:51.961
What are we goin' to Texas for?

43:51.963 --> 43:53.296
- Shut your dumb-ass mouth,

43:53.298 --> 43:55.632
and get the fuckin'
guy in the car.

43:56.768 --> 43:57.834
- Hey, hey, hey!

44:08.912 --> 44:10.179
- Go get him.

44:10.181 --> 44:11.180
- I got a bad back, trav.

44:11.182 --> 44:13.082
I can't roll down there.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.244
- Damn, Travis, why didn't
you just kill him back here.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.488
- Split up, and get him.

44:42.714 --> 44:43.646
- I don't
think we're gonna find him

44:43.648 --> 44:44.947
out here tonight, Travis.

44:44.949 --> 44:48.518
- We'll get him
tomorrow, right, trav?

44:48.520 --> 44:49.452
- Gonna go by his house.

44:49.454 --> 44:52.155
He's gonna show up eventually.

44:52.157 --> 44:53.157
- Tonight?

44:56.060 --> 44:57.827
Tonight works for me.

44:57.829 --> 44:59.128
- Cancel some plans.

44:59.130 --> 45:00.763
It's no big problem.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.170
- Deadbeats are deadbeats 'cause
they're creatures of habit.

45:07.172 --> 45:09.739
And he's got some bad habits.

45:48.178 --> 45:50.146
- What can I get you?

45:51.682 --> 45:52.682
- Whiskey.

45:53.717 --> 45:54.851
The bottle.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.553
- I can't sell you the bottle.

45:57.555 --> 45:58.354
- I'm just walkin'.

45:58.356 --> 45:59.922
I wanna take it with me.

45:59.924 --> 46:03.426
- Look, I sure as hell
can't sell it to go.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.864
You okay, son?

46:11.568 --> 46:12.769
- My sister's dead.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.039
He killed her.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.141
She's...

46:19.576 --> 46:20.576
She's dead.

46:22.045 --> 46:24.147
- You got money?

46:24.149 --> 46:26.649
- I don't got nothin'.

46:26.651 --> 46:27.717
Not anymore.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.626
- You didn't get it here.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.805
- I'm gonna kill him.

46:49.673 --> 46:51.974
The guy that did it.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.643
And anybody that helped.

46:53.645 --> 46:55.144
- Yes, sir.

46:55.146 --> 46:58.014
That's the way we
do it down here.

47:24.475 --> 47:26.108
- They killed her.

47:26.110 --> 47:28.277
They ran her over.

47:28.279 --> 47:31.214
They have to pay
for what they did.

47:32.349 --> 47:35.218
- Ain't how the
world works, Izzy.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.559
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

48:28.873 --> 48:32.041
- What are you doin' out here?

48:32.043 --> 48:33.843
You scared the hell outta me.

48:33.845 --> 48:35.211
- Funny.

48:35.213 --> 48:38.514
You don't seem like the type
that scares easy to me, Nola.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.683
- What happened?

48:40.685 --> 48:41.817
- She's dead.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.854
- Why do you think that?

48:44.856 --> 48:46.555
- Travis said he saw it.

48:46.557 --> 48:47.957
It was that ex-boyfriend.

48:47.959 --> 48:49.258
I knew it, too.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.960
I knew it was that
son of a bitch.

48:50.962 --> 48:53.796
- So what are you gonna do now?

48:53.798 --> 48:56.265
- What am I gonna do?

48:56.267 --> 48:58.267
I'm gonna kill him.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.368
- You have to be sure.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.370
- I don't have to be anything.

49:01.372 --> 49:02.772
- You kill someone
when you ain't 100%,

49:02.774 --> 49:05.908
you will wonder about it
for the rest of your life.

49:05.910 --> 49:10.179
- It's not lookin' like that's
gonna be a very long time.

49:12.549 --> 49:14.283
What do I do?

49:14.285 --> 49:15.751
- Ask him.

49:15.753 --> 49:17.053
- Oh, just ask him?

49:17.055 --> 49:19.956
Just ask him, just ask him.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.324
- Ask him hard.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.494
Ask him 'til you believe him.

49:27.297 --> 49:29.632
Then when you know he did it,

49:30.934 --> 49:32.368
then you kill him.

49:37.975 --> 49:38.975
Come on.

49:46.850 --> 49:47.850
Isobel

49:49.953 --> 49:51.687
is an amazing person.

49:52.689 --> 49:53.689
- Was.

49:55.192 --> 49:57.626
- She were nice to me.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.362
Never acted above me.

50:00.464 --> 50:01.464
She was

50:03.033 --> 50:04.033
good.

50:04.968 --> 50:06.702
- I know how she was.

50:08.271 --> 50:11.841
- You remember back
when you were good, Max?

50:11.843 --> 50:13.175
- No.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.244
- I remember when I was.

50:17.647 --> 50:21.017
I was just a happy,
dumb-ass little kid.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.454
But someone took that from me.

50:26.523 --> 50:30.326
He killed the innocent
girl that I was.

50:30.328 --> 50:33.462
And I lived with
him for a long time.

50:35.165 --> 50:36.699
Him walkin' around.

50:37.734 --> 50:40.369
But I knew I'd get my chance.

50:41.471 --> 50:43.873
I invited him
somewhere secluded.

50:45.475 --> 50:49.478
Asshole actually
thought he was gonna get laid.

50:54.651 --> 50:56.252
And I killed him.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.757
But I made him know why first.

51:04.327 --> 51:06.462
Before I blew his face off,

51:07.998 --> 51:11.534
he knew it was because of
what he had taken from me.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.742
You take him someplace quiet.

51:19.744 --> 51:22.511
Somewhere not connected to you.

51:26.616 --> 51:28.517
Might come in handy.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.392
- Where have you been?

51:36.394 --> 51:37.426
- I took a beer.

51:38.362 --> 51:39.962
- Answer the question.

51:39.964 --> 51:41.464
You've been gone for days.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.632
- Well, warden,
if you must know,

51:43.634 --> 51:45.534
I met a lovely girl
at the tiki bar

51:45.536 --> 51:46.769
who has a house
out on crossford.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.404
- 11 P.M.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.705
That's the time you're supposed
to be home every night.

51:49.707 --> 51:50.973
11 P.M.

51:50.975 --> 51:52.374
- Will you dial it down a notch.

51:52.376 --> 51:53.642
Jesus.
- Fuck it.

51:53.644 --> 51:55.111
Why don't you just ruin
your life and mine.

51:55.113 --> 51:55.911
- Wait, wait, where you goin'.

51:55.913 --> 51:56.712
Come back.

51:56.714 --> 51:57.813
I'm sorry, okay.

51:57.815 --> 52:00.216
Come on, have a beer with me.

52:00.218 --> 52:02.818
- You're drinking my last one.

52:02.820 --> 52:05.621
- I will give it to you.

52:05.623 --> 52:06.889
Come on.

52:06.891 --> 52:08.457
Sit down on this couch
I get to sleep on,

52:08.459 --> 52:10.426
and hang out with me.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.461
- God, you're so annoying.

52:14.297 --> 52:16.165
And you look like hell.

52:16.167 --> 52:19.001
- That is not the
consensus at the tiki bar.

52:19.003 --> 52:20.836
Apparently I've just
gotten better-looking

52:20.838 --> 52:23.005
since high school.

52:23.007 --> 52:25.407
- I do not recall you looking
so old in high school.

52:25.409 --> 52:26.442
- Yeah, who asked you?

52:26.444 --> 52:28.310
Give me that.

52:28.312 --> 52:29.845
So, where's the shithead?

52:29.847 --> 52:31.013
I figured you'd over

52:31.015 --> 52:31.780
at his place tonight.
- I told you,

52:31.782 --> 52:32.515
I'm done with him.

52:32.517 --> 52:33.916
I don't wanna talk

52:33.918 --> 52:34.917
- you better be.
- About my relationship status

52:34.919 --> 52:35.951
with you, you're
such an asshole.

52:35.953 --> 52:36.752
- Okay, I'm sorry.

52:36.754 --> 52:38.020
I'm sorry, wait.

52:38.022 --> 52:39.688
I won't talk about the
shithead anymore, okay.

52:39.690 --> 52:41.023
Promise.

52:41.025 --> 52:41.857
Come on, sit down with me.

52:41.859 --> 52:42.825
Let's watch TV.

52:42.827 --> 52:43.827
Oh.

52:44.461 --> 52:46.295
I'll let you drive?

52:46.297 --> 52:47.297
Huh?

52:48.098 --> 52:48.998
Ah, that a girl.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.699
- You're so annoying.

52:50.701 --> 52:52.001
- You like it.

52:53.136 --> 52:54.103
Come on.

52:54.105 --> 52:55.437
- You smell like cigarettes.

52:55.439 --> 52:58.207
- That's 'cause I had
a lot of cigarettes.

52:58.209 --> 52:59.708
Here, focus on
what you're doin'.

53:02.113 --> 53:06.015
- I love you, big
brother, you know that?

53:06.017 --> 53:07.583
- Back at you, kid.

53:20.665 --> 53:21.797
Hey.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.513
Yeah, go ahead and scream.

53:37.515 --> 53:38.747
Scream it up.

53:38.749 --> 53:40.416
Nobody's gonna
save you out here.

53:40.418 --> 53:41.917
- Please, don't kill me.

53:41.919 --> 53:44.186
- Now you're
begging, that's nice.

53:44.188 --> 53:45.554
I like that.

53:45.556 --> 53:46.655
Did Isobel beg?

53:46.657 --> 53:48.824
- I didn't do anything.

53:48.826 --> 53:50.326
Please, Max.

53:50.328 --> 53:51.093
Max.

53:51.095 --> 53:52.094
Max, no, no, no.

53:52.096 --> 53:54.663
What are you doing now?

53:54.665 --> 53:55.864
Max, please, stop it.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.600
No.

53:57.602 --> 53:59.001
- I know it was you.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.269
I wanna know why.

54:00.271 --> 54:03.272
I wanna know why you
killed my sister.

54:03.274 --> 54:04.440
- Killed her?

54:05.242 --> 54:06.408
I didn't, she's not dead.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.710
- You tell me right now!

54:07.712 --> 54:09.078
I know that you did it!

54:09.080 --> 54:10.346
Why?

54:10.348 --> 54:11.347
- I wouldn't.

54:11.349 --> 54:12.681
I love her.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.717
I've always loved her, man.

54:14.719 --> 54:15.951
She's not dead.

54:15.953 --> 54:18.921
- I have a witness
that saw you kill her.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.390
- He said it was me, he's lying.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.092
I haven't seen Isobel in weeks.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.527
- He said she was
fucking the wrong guy.

54:25.529 --> 54:26.929
- I told you she
left me for that...

54:27.865 --> 54:29.231
- what, you tell me right now,

54:29.233 --> 54:30.266
left you for who?

54:30.268 --> 54:31.634
- Her boss.

54:31.636 --> 54:32.636
Man.

54:33.370 --> 54:34.470
Her boss.

54:37.275 --> 54:39.575
I caught her cheating on me.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.977
That's why I did what I did.

54:41.979 --> 54:42.911
- You followed me.
- I do understand.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.213
Fuck all the guys you fucked.

54:44.215 --> 54:46.615
That's why I hit her.

54:46.617 --> 54:47.783
I went crazy.

54:50.120 --> 54:54.390
No charges if I kept my mouth
shut about the two of them.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.659
He's runnin' for
reelection, you know.

54:56.661 --> 54:58.060
Asshole.

54:58.062 --> 55:01.463
She didn't tell
you that, did she?

55:01.465 --> 55:03.632
I love her, man.

55:03.634 --> 55:04.767
I wouldn't kill her.

55:04.769 --> 55:07.469
I wouldn't kill anybody.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.637
Please.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.606
Just let me go.

55:12.076 --> 55:14.677
- If you say anything to anyone.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.478
- I won't, I swear.

55:17.580 --> 55:19.114
Hey Max.

55:19.116 --> 55:20.116
Can you?

55:29.693 --> 55:31.760
- That's it?

55:31.762 --> 55:32.795
That's all I get?

55:32.797 --> 55:34.163
- Well, what do you want?

55:34.165 --> 55:37.299
- I don't know, you ever
put away any bad guys?

55:37.301 --> 55:38.467
Is it hard?

55:38.469 --> 55:39.702
What about the
people you work with?

55:39.704 --> 55:41.804
What's it like workin'
with lawyers all day?

55:41.806 --> 55:43.939
And the people, are
they cool at all?

55:43.941 --> 55:46.809
And what about that guy on
all the commercials, Mr. da?

55:46.811 --> 55:47.643
He's looks like a moron.

55:47.645 --> 55:48.877
Is he a moron?

55:48.879 --> 55:50.879
- Well, yes, yes, no,

55:52.349 --> 55:54.650
everyone I work with is nice,
but none of them are cool,

55:54.652 --> 55:57.619
and he's not a moron, he's fine.

55:57.621 --> 55:58.620
- I don't understand you.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.389
Why don't you tell me nothin'.

56:00.391 --> 56:01.690
I'm your big brother.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.359
I can't help you if I
don't know what's goin' on.

56:03.361 --> 56:04.893
See what I'm sayin'?

56:04.895 --> 56:07.129
- I'm pickin' up what
you're puttin' down.

56:07.131 --> 56:08.697
- Okay, so,

56:08.699 --> 56:10.699
how's your job?

56:10.701 --> 56:12.201
- Well,

56:12.203 --> 56:14.770
my job is fan fuckin' tastic.

56:15.672 --> 56:19.842
I love it more than I
love gravy on biscuits.

56:19.844 --> 56:20.642
- You're makin' fun of me now?

56:20.644 --> 56:21.810
- Yes, I am.

56:21.812 --> 56:23.078
- All right, college mouth.

56:23.080 --> 56:23.846
That's right, that's right,
you're better than me.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.414
You know what,

56:25.416 --> 56:26.648
keep your big, stupid
life a big, stupid secret.

56:26.650 --> 56:27.716
See if I care.

56:27.718 --> 56:28.751
- My job's fine.

56:28.753 --> 56:31.687
There's nothin' to talk about.

56:31.689 --> 56:33.856
- I need a gun, Lazarus.

56:33.858 --> 56:36.024
- For show or for use?

56:36.026 --> 56:39.395
Price goes up if it's for use.

56:39.397 --> 56:41.029
I'm guessin' it's for use.

56:41.031 --> 56:43.832
$500, and I can have
somethin' for you tomorrow.

56:43.834 --> 56:47.569
- I don't have $500, and
I don't need it tomorrow.

56:47.571 --> 56:48.871
I need it tonight.

56:48.873 --> 56:50.672
- Do you think I get a fuckin'
write-off on this shit?

56:50.674 --> 56:53.742
- I'm tellin' you I need
it because you owe me.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.177
For that thing before.

56:55.179 --> 56:58.747
- That thing before
was a long goddamn time ago.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.249
- I ain't ever traded on it.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.683
- The hell you haven't.

57:01.685 --> 57:03.385
- I need a gun, Lazarus.

57:03.387 --> 57:07.689
- Well, you better figure
out another way to get one.

57:11.795 --> 57:12.928
Evenin'.

57:14.130 --> 57:16.899
Ya'll look like ya'll need a
couple of shots on the house.

57:18.536 --> 57:20.702
- Travis was right, man.

57:20.704 --> 57:22.938
- Deadbeats are
creatures of habit.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.373
That's what he said.

57:24.375 --> 57:26.141
- Here you are, sure as shit.

57:26.143 --> 57:28.444
Deadbeat, back in
the same deadbeat bar

57:28.446 --> 57:29.912
you drink at every damn night.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.113
- Hey now.

57:31.115 --> 57:33.649
Why don't ya'll take
this shit outside.

57:33.651 --> 57:34.983
- Hey.

57:34.985 --> 57:37.653
Why don't you pour them shots?

57:37.655 --> 57:41.156
And then go in the back
and take a break, old man.

57:48.832 --> 57:50.933
- Get one for our friend, too.

57:50.935 --> 57:53.635
- Yeah, give old Max one, too.

57:58.775 --> 58:00.042
Drink up, Max.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.628
- You caused us a lot
of trouble last night.

58:19.630 --> 58:21.163
- Yeah, a whole lot of trouble.

58:21.165 --> 58:22.264
- We ain't been home.

58:22.266 --> 58:24.833
We ain't slept, we ain't ate.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.769
Wait a damn minute.

58:27.771 --> 58:31.039
- Will you get the
hell outta the way.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.360
- No, no.

58:58.868 --> 59:01.537
- You and me is even now, Max.

59:15.852 --> 59:16.952
- Okay.

59:28.998 --> 59:31.166
- Don't ever come back.

59:31.168 --> 59:33.435
And don't get pulled over.

59:50.019 --> 59:51.119
- Paul.

59:52.121 --> 59:55.924
Paul, I think there's
someone in the house.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.708
Wait.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.784
- Look.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:56.786
We don't have to do...

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:46.194
- I asked him hard,
like you said.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:47.696
I'm glad you said that.

01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:48.764
I was wrong.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.534
It wasn't the guy
I thought it was.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:55.237
Travis meant the other guy.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:56.204
He meant the da.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.206
And

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.041
when I talked to him,
I knew he was off.

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:03.278
But I didn't think
he had it in him.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.651
- Is that his blood on you?

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:10.653
- No.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.155
No, that's Jeff's.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:15.991
Maybe Larry's.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.393
But probably Jeff's.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:22.063
- Who are Larry and Jeff?

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:25.066
- The man sent them to kill me.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:27.169
But I killed them.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.670
I got a gun now.

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:33.041
I just don't know who to kill.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.645
- Why don't you
know who to kill?

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:41.283
- The da's the man that
Izzy was sleeping with.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:44.152
That's who Travis
said killed her.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.291
I went there this
mornin' to kill him.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:51.393
But somebody beat me to it.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:54.362
The da is dead.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:03.605
- Come on.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.945
Take these off.

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:11.179
- I have to kill them.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.180
- I know.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.481
I know you do.

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.283
- They killed her.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.052
Somebody did.

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:18.820
Maybe it was the da who did it.

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:19.621
Why is he dead?

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:20.956
Who killed him?

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:26.161
They can't get away with it.

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:29.197
She was with best part of me.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.066
You know what that's like?

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:33.702
When somebody else is
the best part of you?

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:34.704
- Yeah.

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:36.638
I do.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.975
You have to sleep.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.143
- I'm super tired.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:43.245
- I know.

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:47.048
We're gonna get you cleaned up.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.149
You're gonna sleep.

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:51.553
And when you wake up, we
will take care of them.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.754
Together.

01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:54.189
- Kill them.

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:55.290
- Yes.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.412
- Breaking news this morning.

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.914
We can just confirmed that
district attorney Paul melancon

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:54.616
and his wife, Margaret melancon,

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:57.419
were gunned down in their
homes late last night.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:01.156
Shreveport police are searching
for this man, Max chase,

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:03.658
in connection to those murders.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.329
- You're not gonna
have much time.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:09.331
Do you want vengeance

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.333
for Isobel?

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:12.734
- Yes.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:17.405
- Then you're gonna have
to make your moves quick.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.341
You get in there, and
you hit Travis first,

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.643
'cause he's the muscle.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:25.914
The man, he ain't a
fighter, he's a strategist.

01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:29.985
You go in, pop 'em both,
and get outta there.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:34.255
- You and I both know if I go
in there, I ain't comin' out.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.094
- Make them pay, Max.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.601
- Travis, why
are you calling me here?

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.703
- I think we
might have a problem.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:51.272
- We don't talk
about problems on the phone.

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:52.507
- It's important.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.275
- Then speak carefully.

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:56.177
- I haven't heard from my guys.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.659
I think somethin'
might have happened.

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.652
- Nothin' personal.

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:07.022
- Well, that sounds mysterious.

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.190
Why the fuck should I care?

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.492
- My guys
were out taking care of

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:13.628
that little problem
from the other night.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.863
I think he might be
off the reservation.

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:17.699
If he is, he's gonna be pissed.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.801
You need to watch
out for yourself.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.036
- You better get
down here, Travis.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.471
You're gonna miss the party.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.510
- You ever killed anyone?

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:29.978
- What?

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.312
- You heard me.

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.849
- You think I kill people?

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.851
- I have no idea what you do.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:38.420
I know what you've
been caught doing.

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.588
But I'm guessing that's
just the tip of the iceberg.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:41.856
- So, what?

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:42.757
Like a hitman for
the mob or somethin'?

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.426
- I didn't say that.

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:47.228
I just asked you a simple,
straightforward question.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.397
Have you ever killed anyone?

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:52.367
- No, little sister, I
have never killed anyone.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.269
- Would you tell me if you had?

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:55.336
- No.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.005
- But you haven't?

01:07:57.007 --> 01:07:58.973
- Not that you know of.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.277
- I don't think you have.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:05.547
You act all tough, but you're
just a big softie underneath.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:08.483
- Well, everything's
the situation.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:13.621
- What in the hell
does that even mean?

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.758
- You are so dead.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.861
No matter where you go, my
people are gonna find you.

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:23.465
- But I got questions,
John, and I want answers.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.433
Is it all right if
I call you John?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.533
Callin' you the man
these points your face,

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:28.368
that just seems kind of stupid.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.537
- Fuck you.

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:37.779
- Did you have
Travis kill Isobel?

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.180
Did she suffer?

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.983
You're going to talk to me.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:45.653
- After all I've seen, and
all I've survived,

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.889
you think you're gonna
put a scare on me?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.960
Don't let this gray
hair fool you, no.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.328
- No, that's a good point.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:55.229
Let's see.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.296
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.299
No, wait, wait.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.002
Put it down.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:39.107
Put it down.

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:47.448
Get up.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.582
Move forward.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.618
Move, move, move.

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:52.654
Move.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.720
Right there.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.958
Get on your knees, trav.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.894
- Did you kill the boys?

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:03.064
- Yeah, it seemed like the
thing to do at the time.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.599
So now you tell me.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:06.734
- Your sister?

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:07.802
- My sister.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.638
- I told you I had
nothin' to do with that.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.906
- You know, I was on
my way to kill the da

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:13.408
because of what you told me.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.577
But you beat me
to it, didn't ya?

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:17.478
- Well, he had it comin'.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.515
Convenient, seein' as you were
out breakin' parole and all.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:22.550
But why'd you wanna kill him?

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:25.053
- You said Isobel was
fucking the wrong guy.

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:26.387
He's the guy she
was sleepin' with.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:30.692
- Now, I never said guy.

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:33.094
You ever ask your buddy, Nola?

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:34.495
People got a habit
of disappearing

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:36.598
when they hang
out with that one.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.833
- Nola Barnes, the
man's errand girl.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:41.703
- Errand girl?

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:42.837
Try button man.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.906
Yeah, she told the cops

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.574
she was just delivering
when she got busted.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.343
But no, that was her money.

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.612
She'd just earned it.

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:52.180
- You're full of shit.

01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:53.448
- Ask the man.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:57.285
Yeah, she'd get up
nice and personal.

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.787
Spend the night or whatever.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.223
They never saw it comin'.

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:03.958
And that's the truth.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:08.296
She could make people disappear.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.898
Yep.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.167
I'd ask her if I were you.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:31.586
Fuck.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:03.084
I knew you were trouble the
day I first laid eyes on you.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.686
- Say hey to Karen for me.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.801
You really didn't kill her?

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.740
You had nothing to do with it?

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.250
Huh.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.856
- Max chase,

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.023
suspect wanted in the murder

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:17.825
of district attorney
Paul melancon

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:20.094
is now being sought in
connection with the murder

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:22.830
of keithville rancher,
Patrick adamson.

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.699
Adamson has been
missing since Tuesday,

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:27.235
and when family members
showed up to investigate,

01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:29.437
they found his body in the home.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:30.705
Police believe that chase

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.240
may have been hiding
out in the home

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:35.243
while planning the assassination
of the district attorney.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.244
If you have any information...

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.879
- nice digs.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:38.679
Who's place?

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.782
- Just some guy I used to know.

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:43.117
Don't worry, he ain't
comin' back anytime soon.

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:44.952
No one'll find me here.

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:47.288
- What do I do?

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:50.458
- Ask him 'til you believe him.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.926
Then you kill him.

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:54.796
Come on.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:16.117
She talked about you some.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.119
- Yeah?

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.988
- She loved you very much.

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.195
- What else did she say?

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:32.900
- She took me to
this abandoned building.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:37.939
- What?

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:44.145
- Said you all used to hide
there when you were kids.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.848
- She took you there?

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:47.850
Why?

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:53.955
- She said if
I ever needed to hide,

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:56.357
the man was after me,

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:57.825
I should go there.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.661
She'd meet me.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:19.541
- Oh Jesus.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:25.479
- Well, look at you,
all not dead and stuff.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.015
What happened the
killin' the bad guys

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:30.217
and goin' down in
a Blaze of glory?

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.286
- The narrative took a twist.

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:34.388
- They messed you
up pretty good.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:37.592
- You should see the other guy.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.961
- What are you doin' here, Max?

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.963
- You told me to come, Nola.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.230
- Did I?

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:44.932
- Yeah.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.268
You told me that Izzy
brought you here.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:48.469
Just like that.

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:51.639
Casual, like it's no big deal.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:53.040
Why would she do that?

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.876
Why would the two
of you come here?

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.878
Why would you throw
it out like that?

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.881
And why the hell wouldn't
I question it at the time?

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:03.451
- Well, postcoital and all that.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.054
I wouldn't be too
hard on yourself.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.322
- I used to bring her here.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.957
When we were kids.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.793
I told her if she ever
needed a place to hide out

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:15.162
to come here, and I'd meet her.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:18.466
Well, obviously
she told you that.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.767
That's a strange conversation

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:22.670
for a lawyer and
a witness to have.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.912
Did you kill my baby sister?

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:33.014
- No.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:35.583
- You're a liar.

01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:36.851
- She's a liar!

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:42.056
She never stopped
fuckin' the da!

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.259
She said she did.

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.096
She said she loved me.

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:53.000
She said she was done with him.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.006
But then that fuckin' lawyer

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.274
tells her what I
did for the man,

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.276
and she believes him.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.278
And not me.

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:08.616
I was gonna change for her.

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:11.585
I was ready to
leave it all behind.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.790
- So you sleep with me, why?

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:18.292
- Because you needed convincing.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:20.561
- To kill the man for you.

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:24.465
I didn't do it, by the way.

01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:25.467
- No?

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.069
Why not?

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.838
- I figured if I don't
kill you, he will.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:35.876
- Oh Max.

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.080
Oh maxie, maxie.

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:45.453
You are nothin'
compared to your sister.

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.256
Do you realize that?

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:54.395
- I've known that my whole life.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.596
- It's funny.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.633
You taste the same.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.071
- What did you do to her?

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:09.110
- Mmm, it is just
eatin' you up, ain't it?

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:09.910
Not knowin'.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:10.912
- Tell me!

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:16.751
- We argued.

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.754
And she left.

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:22.590
But later I called her.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.461
And said I'm sorry,
and I'm scared.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.366
Travis is lookin' for
me, and I need you.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.937
She's a real
softie, your sister.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:41.475
Later I met her
at her apartment.

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:44.178
And I took her.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.649
- What does that mean?

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:49.651
- Took her.

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:56.457
- Get off of me!

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.658
No, please.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:09.236
Look at you.

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:14.809
You're just so upset,

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:17.144
you don't know what to do.

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:21.782
- How did you kill her, huh?

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:22.850
How?

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:24.251
- I didn't.

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:25.519
I didn't kill her.

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:32.259
You think you need to save her?

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:33.661
To protect her?

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.197
I'll protect her!

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:37.199
Me!

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:55.916
Let's ask Izzy if
she needs rescuing.

01:20:58.286 --> 01:20:59.386
- Oh shit.

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.457
- Come on, Max.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:07.194
Don't give up now.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.863
You're almost there.

01:21:17.006 --> 01:21:18.806
- You know what,
you son of a bitch.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.724
- Max.

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:41.862
Max, Max!

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:43.330
Max!

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.332
Max, Max!

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.233
Max!

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:00.714
What did you do to him?

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:02.349
What did you do to him?

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:03.517
He's hurt.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:06.020
Please, he needs me.

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:07.087
- I need you.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.456
- Let me go, you crazy bitch.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:18.132
- I know you're upset right now.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:19.867
Don't be.

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.603
This is what I do.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.073
I deal with problems.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:28.609
- Please, please,
don't hurt him.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:29.476
- He's in the way.

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.445
- No, no, no, he's not.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.581
- Baby.

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:38.686
This is for the best.

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.287
- No.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.388
Nola.

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.223
Nola.

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:44.925
Nola, don't you hurt him.

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:46.360
No, goddamnit, no!

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.896
No!

01:22:48.898 --> 01:22:50.431
- I will protect you now.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:52.666
- Please, no.

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:55.836
- I'll get you far
away from here.

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:36.343
- What are we drinkin' to?

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.379
- Your impending incarceration.

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:40.014
- Well, that is
stinkin' thinkin'.

01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:42.516
- Is this funny to you, Max?

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:47.454
- You did the best you could.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.057
- That judge is an asshole.

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:51.025
- Drink your drink.

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:53.327
- I don't wanna drink my drink.

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:57.598
- I am probably goin' away
tomorrow for nine to 13 months.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.435
Drink your fuckin' drink.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:09.877
Yup.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.119
- Are you scared?

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:22.589
- Yep.

01:24:34.036 --> 01:24:36.003
- Come on, maxie.
- What's your emergency?

01:24:36.005 --> 01:24:37.404
- Hi, my brother's hurt.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.405
Please hurry, please.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.374
He's bleeding fast.

01:24:40.376 --> 01:24:42.376
We're in downtown.

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:49.683
Hold on, maxie,
help's on the way.

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.553
- Don't call me that.

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:55.055
- Are you okay?

01:24:55.057 --> 01:24:57.191
- No.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:24:58.358
I'm not okay.

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.361
I'm pretty goddamn
far from okay.

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:02.429
Yeah.

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.264
No.

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.500
Are you okay?

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:13.407
You look like shit.

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:17.778
- You look really bad.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:22.049
- Scars are
sexy, chicks dig scars.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.086
- You know, I knew you'd come.

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:28.555
They're here, I'm gonna...

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:29.623
- no, wait, no, no, no, don't.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:32.559
Don't, don't go nowhere, wait.

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.460
Just shut up.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:36.497
Just stay right there, okay?

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:37.499
Okay?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.666
- Okay.

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:43.437
Okay.

01:25:43.439 --> 01:25:44.872
Okay, big brother.

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.975
- That a girl.
