00:12.680 --> 00:15.480
(O'Neill) So, Laira,
when's the big show start?

00:15.840 --> 00:18.160
Soon. Be patient.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.480
Oh, I'm patient... I'm nothing if not patient.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.080
- When's it start?
- Is he always like this?

00:24.240 --> 00:27.560
- Quite frequently.
- Thank you, Teal'c.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.640
Laira, we haven't seen any
fire rain these past few nights.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.480
- How come it's gonna fall tonight?
- It begins this night each year.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.480
Whoa... The same night every year?
That doesn't make sense.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.560
Unless the planet's orbit travels through
an asteroid belt, in which case...

00:43.720 --> 00:46.920
Please! Don't suck the fun out of this.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.200
- Sorry, sir.
- When I was a child,...

00:50.360 --> 00:54.400
..my father told me that the fire rain
was the tears of our ancestors,...

00:54.560 --> 00:57.360
..longing to be reunited.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.560
A falling star. That's, uh... that's what
we call fire rain where we come from.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.600
In our culture,
you're supposed to make a wish.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.640
- On Chulak we call it "tal pak ryd".
- Which means, uh...

01:14.800 --> 01:16.840
..falling star.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.520
What do you think, Jack?
Was it worth the effort?

01:20.640 --> 01:24.760
Oh, yeah...
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of fireworks.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.840
(roaring)

01:32.720 --> 01:34.640
Whoa!

01:39.920 --> 01:43.360
Carter... How close was that?

01:44.120 --> 01:46.320
- Close, sir.
- How big?

01:46.680 --> 01:48.840
- Big.
- Thought so.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.640
I was... rather concerned
for a minute there, sir.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.560
- I don't understand.
- Laira, that's what we call a near miss.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.960
If that had struck instead of
bouncing off of the atmosphere...

02:01.120 --> 02:03.960
- This is an annual event?
- Yes.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.480
Though it grows
more spectacular every year.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.400
By tomorrow evening the entire sky w...

02:14.360 --> 02:16.840
What's wrong?

02:17.360 --> 02:20.040
I'll make some more
observations tonight, sir.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.640
I'm gonna check the, uh...
geological record in the morning.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.520
I'll... make a wish.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.200
See this bright dot?
It represents your world, Edora.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.040
It orbits your sun in a big circle like this...

04:05.200 --> 04:09.120
..and crosses through an asteroid belt
up here at its widest point.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.280
As you pass through the particles, some
of them burn up in Edora's atmosphere.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.120
- As fire rain.
- Exactly.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.839
The problem is,
the asteroid belt isn't uniform.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.480
So certain orbits in certain years
must pass through a denser debris field.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.920
Ever remember fire rain
striking the ground?

04:25.080 --> 04:30.200
Not in my lifetime. Nor in my father's.
But there is a tale of the ancestors.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.960
That on the second day of the fire rain
there was a distant thunder,...

04:34.120 --> 04:37.840
..and the horizon burned
as though the sun never set.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.960
- How long ago was that?
- Many, many years ago.

04:42.480 --> 04:47.200
Mornin', campers. Who's goin' on
Daniel's little geology field trip?

04:47.520 --> 04:49.440
Garan!

04:53.360 --> 04:55.160
He can show you the way to the caves.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.360
He and a young girl go there from
time to time. I don't know why(!)

04:58.520 --> 05:00.440
(Garan) Mother!

05:01.440 --> 05:03.360
(Laira) Fair day, and be well.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.960
Sir, I'd like to go back to Earth and input
the data I collected into the mainframe.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.440
Go ahead.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.520
- Fair day, Laira.
- Fair day.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.240
I'm sure you want to discuss the treaty.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.880
Between our two worlds.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.200
Sure... We could do that.

05:33.360 --> 05:39.240
The decay rate differential between the
layers of naqahdah is about 1 50 years...

05:39.400 --> 05:41.960
- What's naqahdah?
- A mineral substance.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.680
You see, the further down
these striations we go,...

05:45.840 --> 05:49.080
..the further back
into Edora's past we travel.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.960
These layers are different.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.000
They represent naqahdah dusts
thrown up by impact events.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.080
Cool.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.520
Uh... J-Jack says that.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.720
Yes, he does.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.080
I'm not really sure
that, uh, "cool" applies to this.

06:09.240 --> 06:14.520
You see, something like this happened
on my world and nearly wiped out all life.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.600
- That's what's gonna happen here?
- We only know it has happened...

06:18.760 --> 06:21.960
..in varying degrees of destruction
every 1 50 years or so.

06:22.120 --> 06:26.800
And it appears that is precisely
the amount of time since the last impact.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.480
I see no reason to withhold the truth
from these people, Daniel Jackson.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.200
Is there anything we can do to stop it?

06:35.320 --> 06:37.240
No.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.880
According to the observations I made,
the near miss was just the first...

06:47.040 --> 06:52.600
..of hundreds of car-size asteroids
directly in the path of Edora, P5C-768.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.520
- The night sky is full of them.
- We can't evacuate an entire planet.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.600
These are the only descendants...

06:58.760 --> 07:02.520
..of a people brought to Edora
by the Goa'uld thousands of years ago.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.360
There may only be
a small number of strikes locally.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.360
If that's the case,
we can send them home in a few days.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.560
If not, we'd be saving
the last of a people, sir.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.040
Paynan. This is Jack.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.040
They say
you've come through the stone ring.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.120
Hard thing to ask a man to believe.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.560
I know what you mean.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.480
Any luck?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.560
There is nothing more
than meets the eye here.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.080
Our fields,
those few buildings... Our children.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.160
What we have, we need.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.240
We're only interested in fair trades.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.320
Many of my people are most curious
to know what it is we have...

08:15.480 --> 08:17.560
..that you could possibly want.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.960
Well, you remember how excited
Carter got the day we got here?

08:22.120 --> 08:25.400
- Something in our soil.
- That's a mineral called naqahdah.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.320
We don't have it on Earth. It's...
Well, it's very important to us.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.400
Why?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.559
It's powerful.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.400
And in return for taking
this naqahdah from our soil?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.480
There are a lot of things
we could help you out with.

08:41.640 --> 08:46.560
Medicine, technology, education.
We'd become friends.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.720
We're already friends.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.320
Closer friends?

08:51.480 --> 08:55.600
My mother taught me to be wary
of men wishing to be closer friends.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.440
If you'd like, I'll negotiate
this treaty with her.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.280
That way there'd be no conflict of interest.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.240
I've never seen the fire rain
in the light of day.

09:13.480 --> 09:17.320
- Anybody else see that?
- This is Carter, sir. I did.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.560
I think it's just the beginning, sir.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.320
Look at this.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.880
It's a cooking utensil.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.240
Which probably means
people spent time here.

09:34.400 --> 09:39.560
Perhaps this cave allowed some Edorans
to survive the last meteor bombardment.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.640
The ancestors.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.720
- Teal'c, Daniel. Back to the village, ASAP.
- Understood, O'Neill.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.360
Folks, we think the fire rain
is gonna start hitting the ground soon.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.400
As a precaution, we'd like to take you all
to our planet till the threat is over.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.880
There is no threat.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.840
If just one big meteor
lands within a few miles of here,...

10:01.000 --> 10:03.560
..the explosion
could wipe out the entire village.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.000
Year after year the fire rain comes,
goes and harms no one.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.600
Do you not see what they are doing? They
want us gone so they can claim our lands.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.600
- That's not true.
- If you go with them,...

10:14.760 --> 10:17.560
..you will never see your land again.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.520
For cryin' out loud.
There's always one like you in a crowd.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.520
You wanna stay? Stay.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.920
I have come to know these travellers.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.920
And though their world seems far,
it is only a step away.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.760
I will take that step, in good faith.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.200
If you wish to follow,
join us at the stone ring.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.600
And if you do not,
may the ancestors protect you.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.800
You need only take what you can carry.
There'll be plenty of food and water.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.840
Right, folks. Train's leavin'. Let's move!

10:55.880 --> 10:59.760
Garan? Don't forget the prayer chain
that your father gave you.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.520
Garan?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.880
Oh, no.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.920
Have you seen Garan?

11:13.080 --> 11:16.640
Daniel, Teal'c.
Did Garan come back with you?

11:17.800 --> 11:21.080
- He should be here, O'Neill.
- The caves.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.400
We were talking about
previous generations of survivors.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.720
You three go. Get these people outta here.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.600
- We'll find the kids and catch up.
- (Carter) Sir?

11:29.760 --> 11:31.680
Go!

11:39.320 --> 11:42.920
- SG-1's code, sir.
- Here they come, people.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.200
- Doctor, stand by to receive refugees.
- Yes, sir.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.960
Don't be afraid. The others
are waiting for you on the other side.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.160
Sir, this is Carter. We've begun
the evacuation. What's your ETA?

12:07.600 --> 12:11.360
Colonel, we're getting
multiple strikes now. Please respond.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.600
Nothing.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.720
That is the last of them.
The rest wish to remain.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.040
- How many?
- One third of the village.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.120
What?

12:29.280 --> 12:33.680
Why don't you go through to let the
Edorans know that everything's all right?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.760
Colonel, please respond.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.560
Garan. Naytha.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.680
Mother! This is where the ancestors
survived. We brought food, water....

12:45.840 --> 12:48.440
Garan, try this my way.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.080
(meteor strikes)

12:55.800 --> 12:59.840
- It's getting too dangerous, Teal'c.
- I will remain until O'Neill returns.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.400
He can dial home when he gets here.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.080
(alarm sounds)

13:24.360 --> 13:26.440
We're losing wormhole stability.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.320
O'Neill went to help some villagers.
We waited till the last moment.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.320
I know. We almost lost you.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.720
General, I wish to return
with a search party.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.560
That last hit was on top of the gate.
You'd be walking into a firestorm.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.480
- I am willing to take that risk.
- I'm not willing to let you.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.000
We could wait 24 hours
and send a MALP through.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.960
Major Carter's right. If it's safe
by tomorrow, you'll all go.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.880
Carter? Teal'c?

14:36.280 --> 14:39.400
It's still pretty hot out there.
We should stay put.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.720
There's good news. It's raining.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.720
- It should put out some of the fires.
- Could you see the village?

14:52.160 --> 14:54.080
No.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.800
Garan, we had a plan.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.400
Daniel said there's nothing you could do.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.000
We were afraid.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.120
Me too.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.320
(meteor strikes)

15:26.600 --> 15:28.200
(meteor strikes)

15:31.080 --> 15:33.560
Chevron six encoded.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.960
Chevron seven...

15:46.600 --> 15:48.840
..locked.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.080
- Wormhole established.
- Thank God.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.600
- Standing by for MALP deployment, sir.
- Send it through.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.760
The MALP should reach Edora
in four... three... two... one.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.120
We should be receiving
telemetry now, sir.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.680
No signal.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.280
(man) Environmental
reports no telemetry.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.200
(woman) Communications, no telemetry.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.800
The MALP must have been destroyed
as soon as it reached the other side.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.360
Shut it down.

16:45.960 --> 16:50.280
Until you can provide me with answers,
the rescue mission is scrubbed.

16:50.440 --> 16:54.640
Inform our visitors they'll stay with us
until we can make a proper assessment.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.720
Yes, sir.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.040
Paynan?

17:32.960 --> 17:34.880
Laira!

17:36.840 --> 17:40.400
- It is all right.
- One struck Talmar's home.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.800
Three families were inside.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.120
We are all that are left.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.920
Why did you stay?

17:52.080 --> 17:54.640
On the third day we could take no more.

17:55.920 --> 17:59.440
We fled to the stone ring...

17:59.600 --> 18:02.720
Where it used to be.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.480
Used to be?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.320
It's gone.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.320
I'll never see my people again.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.400
They can never come home.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.440
No.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.560
And you?

19:34.880 --> 19:39.640
Thanks be to the ancestors that we live
and have a roof to shield our heads.

19:39.800 --> 19:45.120
Thanks be to the ancestors that
we have food to sustain and nourish us.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.920
This is all that remains of our people,
because of you.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.000
My mother and father...

19:55.160 --> 19:58.360
You took them away through that thing,
and now it is gone.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.000
That thing probably saved their lives.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.240
And if you'd have shut up and listened
to me, this wouldn't be the situation.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.160
This is my home,
and you are welcome here.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.120
You need to eat.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.720
Thank you.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.800
No signal from the radio transmitter, sir.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.600
If the Edoran Stargate were buried,
how was the wormhole established?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.360
- The meteor hit while it was active.
- So... So...

20:57.520 --> 21:01.560
It's possible the molten naqahdah
hardened just above the event horizon.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.080
- Like an iris.
- Yeah.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.680
- Sergeant, shut it down.
- Yes, sir.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.520
That was our last shot, people,
and I'm calling this one.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.080
- I'm declaring him missing in action.
- Perhaps the door can be reached.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.920
- The Tok'ra could send a ship.
- Or the Tollan.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.480
Let me contact our allies
capable of interstellar travel,...

21:26.640 --> 21:28.880
..see if they're willing to help.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.960
Very well, Doctor.

22:10.040 --> 22:15.000
I thought you might like a clean
work shirt. My husband never wore it.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.400
I made it for him just before he died.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.560
- There's a chance the Stargate...
- We have to rebuild before the harvest.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.280
And there are very few of us now.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.240
Wormhole physics -
a field, Major, that you pioneered -

22:53.400 --> 22:58.000
states that under these conditions, matter
won't even reintegrate on the other side.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.480
- There's no way to overcome that.
- I think there is, sir.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.000
And I'm not the one who thought of it.
Sokar did.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.800
When he tried to breach the iris
by bombarding it with a particle beam.

23:08.960 --> 23:13.040
Particles barely small enough to
reintegrate made energy as they decayed.

23:13.200 --> 23:17.080
- Which caused the iris to heat up.
- Exactly. If we could do the same,...

23:17.240 --> 23:22.200
..we could melt the hardened naqahdah
and create a pocket of superheated gas.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.160
- Then what?
- All we have to do is open the gate.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.360
The unstable vortex it generates...

23:27.520 --> 23:31.960
..would be allowed to expand into that
pocket and create an even larger cavern.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.840
One person might be able
to go through, sir, and dig it out.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.760
I think we can safely assume
Teal'c would volunteer, but...

23:41.920 --> 23:46.440
We don't have a particle-beam generator.
We'd have to build one.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.160
Then you'd better get started.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.600
You, uh... missed evening meal.
I brought you something.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.600
Wasn't hungry.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.120
Well, you gotta be.
You've worked all day in the fields.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.800
I've got a couple of hours
of good light left.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.920
I'm sorry.

24:29.680 --> 24:33.040
- For what?
- You can't go home.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.000
- It's my fault.
- No, it's not.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.960
- You working through the night again?
- Yeah. Lot of work to do. Thank you.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.240
Look, Sam, there's no doubt
you are going to solve this,...

25:05.400 --> 25:08.800
..but you have to accept the fact
it's going to take time.

25:08.960 --> 25:12.880
Yeah, well, if I think that way
it could take months.

25:13.040 --> 25:18.360
Daniel says the Tollan could have a ship
in the vicinity of Edora early next year.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.600
He shouldn't have to wait that long.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.600
You miss him.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.360
Yeah.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.400
- Is this a problem?
- No.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.480
No, of course not.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.640
OK.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.240
- Night.
- Night.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.080
Many of us fear
the fire rain will come again.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.520
- Do you?
- No.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.760
If Daniel was right, and he always is,...

26:31.600 --> 26:35.320
..it'll be another 1 50 years
before that happens again.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.360
It's a long time.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.400
I was just kinda wondering
which direction home was.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.480
It's this way.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.400
- No, I meant...
- I know what you meant.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.560
Come.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.400
I'd like your company.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.880
I don't even like my company right now.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.520
You will again.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.600
Loss is that way.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.400
I mourned my husband for 100 days.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.800
I never left my house.
I never spoke to anyone.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.840
After that?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.120
I left my house.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.560
And I spoke to people.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.800
Walk with me.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.600
- You left this at home.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.920
Paynan has invited you
to evening supper.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.200
Why? He doesn't even like me.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.640
He's very grateful for all the help
you've given him in rebuilding his home.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.360
I just hammered a few nails.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.440
Well, I made the nails first
and then I hammered them, but...

28:47.600 --> 28:50.200
Still, you've worked very hard. Thank you.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.600
Anything I can do.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.680
There is something.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.280
Yeah? What?

28:58.680 --> 29:02.960
- No. It's too soon.
- No, come on. Don't... do that.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.040
What?

29:05.200 --> 29:07.200
You'll know when the time comes.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.360
I need a little help here. A hint.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.640
Does that help?

29:24.440 --> 29:26.360
A little.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.920
Initiating beam-firing sequence... now.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.560
Particle beam is operating
at 112% of predicted efficiency.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.640
- How long do we maintain the beam?
- The longer the better.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.280
The important thing will be to dial again
quickly as soon as it shuts down.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.360
(hoedown music)

30:20.480 --> 30:23.040
Well, whaddya think?

30:23.160 --> 30:25.520
Absolute rotgut.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.880
More, please.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.400
What just happened?

30:50.560 --> 30:54.480
The ancestors guided him
to the one they wish him betrothed.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.160
He was peekin'.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.600
What?

31:34.080 --> 31:39.120
MALP should be arriving at the Edora gate
in three... two... one.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.440
Receiving telemetry.

31:44.600 --> 31:49.120
- No, wait. We've lost it. There's no signal.
- What's happened?

31:49.280 --> 31:53.920
- Transmission interrupt at the source.
- Play back the visual.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.240
(Carter) Whoa. There. See?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.120
The gate is horizontal
as you thought, Major Carter.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.760
The MALP slipped back
through the event horizon.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.280
The vortex will have dug
partway to the surface.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.880
Secure yourself above the event horizon
once you're on the other side.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.360
- You'll have to carry everything you need.
- I understand.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.760
I hope you do, son. Because if you fail
to dig your way to the surface,...

32:17.920 --> 32:20.360
..this will be a one-way trip.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.600
- Garan?
- Just us.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.920
(whispers) Ah...

32:42.880 --> 32:47.160
Well, apparently I should expect
a massive headache tomorrow.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.440
So I should... get a head start.

32:58.120 --> 33:02.200
Do you remember when I told you there
was something you could do for me?

33:08.880 --> 33:11.640
I want you to give me a child.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.520
A child.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.760
I wanted to be patient.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.360
I wanted to wait until you had let go
of the life you left behind.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.240
Until you knew that you belonged with us.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.880
Tonight... I see it in your eyes.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.760
(whispers) Laira...

33:40.800 --> 33:42.720
You should know...

33:44.040 --> 33:47.480
..a part of me is never gonna let go
of what I left behind.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.800
(whispers) Well...

33:51.480 --> 33:53.680
That's not the part I want.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.040
Crap.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.800
She is a fine woman.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.360
Yes, she is.

34:56.480 --> 35:00.360
Took you long enough to see that.
I was afraid you were going blind.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.440
No. If I've gone blind,...

35:03.600 --> 35:07.680
..it's from whatever
we were drinking last night.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.240
Tolka.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.000
- Has a bite to it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.120
General Hammond,
I have secured myself on the other side.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.600
Understood, Teal'c.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.680
I will begin immediately.

35:55.320 --> 35:59.800
- Goin' somewhere with that stuff?
- I thought you might not need these.

35:59.960 --> 36:03.000
Well, hang on. Some of that's
pretty good. The jacket is, uh...

36:03.160 --> 36:05.440
Does it remind you of home?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.080
Toss it.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.160
Are you sure?

36:16.760 --> 36:18.880
Yeah.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.160
(drilling)

36:39.280 --> 36:41.240
What's your progress, Teal'c?

36:44.480 --> 36:47.240
It is most difficult, Daniel Jackson.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.160
The gate will shut down
automatically in... 60 seconds.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.320
We won't be able to open it again.

36:53.480 --> 36:57.000
The vortex would vaporise
everything within the cavern.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.640
You'll have a maximum of
four hours of oxygen once we're cut off.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.360
If you haven't reached
the surface by that time...

37:03.480 --> 37:06.640
Then you may want
to wish me "rel tora ke".

37:08.560 --> 37:10.760
Good luck, Teal'c.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.480
(Carter) 15 seconds till shutdown.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.280
10 seconds till shutdown.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.560
Five seconds.

37:47.560 --> 37:52.520
Curling. Big where my grandfather's from
in, uh, northern Minnesota.

37:52.680 --> 37:58.120
You throw a big, round, kind of slab
of rock down this... slab of ice,...

37:58.280 --> 38:00.200
..and you sweep...

38:04.200 --> 38:06.120
What?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.880
When I was taking
your things away today,...

38:12.040 --> 38:15.200
..l thought I heard
a sound come from this.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.400
Perhaps a voice.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.560
This is Colonel Jack O'Neill. Come in.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.720
- O'Neill.
- Teal'c! Where the hell are you?

38:41.120 --> 38:45.240
Attempting to reach the surface.
Little oxygen remains, O'Neill.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.280
- I got you on RDF signal.
- (rapid bleeping)

38:51.520 --> 38:53.440
I'm right on top of you!

39:28.040 --> 39:31.720
Teal'c!
You are one stubborn son of a bitch!

39:52.240 --> 39:55.240
When the MALP sent back
just a few seconds of telemetry,...

39:55.400 --> 39:58.120
..we knew the gate was horizontal, and...

40:00.760 --> 40:02.960
Is he all right?

40:03.120 --> 40:07.200
He's fine. I just don't think
he was expecting to go home again.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.000
You must be very happy
to be going home.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.160
No, I'm not.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.240
You don't have to.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.160
Come with me.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.640
I belong here.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.640
I'll come back. Soon.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.600
We still have that treaty to talk about.

40:35.920 --> 40:40.600
Of course. Our two worlds
are going to be friends.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.720
Closer friends.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.400
Fair day, and be well.
