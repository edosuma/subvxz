00:26.617 --> 00:29.418
<i>Sometimes it's hard to
tell who's alive and who's dead.</i>

00:32.423 --> 00:34.690
<i>I think most people are
scared of the dead.</i>

00:35.926 --> 00:40.963
<i>Not me. I see dead
people all the time.</i>

00:40.965 --> 00:44.665
<i>This story doesn't have
a picture perfect ending.</i>

00:44.667 --> 00:45.933
<i>Not everyone lives.</i>

00:47.371 --> 00:51.772
<i>And again, after what
I've seen, I'm not sure death</i>

00:51.774 --> 00:53.775
<i>is what we think it is.</i>

02:34.877 --> 02:37.879
So, this it, huh?

02:37.881 --> 02:39.981
I hate this fucking place.

02:39.983 --> 02:41.750
Shit, I thought
it'd be bigger.

02:41.752 --> 02:44.619
<i>Heard that a lot, huh?</i>

02:44.621 --> 02:47.655
Shut the fuck up.
This place ain't no joke.

02:50.127 --> 02:51.792
I'm not afraid
of no old man.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.832
Then you're a dumb
motherfucker.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.034
You don't know the shit
that goes on in there.

02:59.036 --> 03:01.602
<i>I heard he eats them.
Like, he fries them up,</i>

03:01.604 --> 03:02.637
and shit.

03:04.074 --> 03:06.441
You know why they call him
The Candy Butcher?

03:06.443 --> 03:08.577
Because to him,
blood is sweet.

03:08.579 --> 03:12.082
This son of a bitch has been
bathing in it for years.

03:13.116 --> 03:14.983
I hear Terrance walked
in on him.

03:14.985 --> 03:17.119
He was sewing people together
in the back.

03:17.121 --> 03:18.387
Like Frankenstein shit.

03:18.389 --> 03:21.055
<i>Yeah, so just think
about that before you do</i>

03:21.057 --> 03:21.722
something stupid.

04:14.510 --> 04:16.644
Hello.

04:16.646 --> 04:19.748
Hello.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.918
I'm looking for the...

04:23.653 --> 04:25.786
I'm looking for the butcher.

04:25.788 --> 04:27.822
May I ask who wants to know?

04:27.824 --> 04:29.156
No, you may not.

04:29.158 --> 04:30.661
<i>Gloria.</i>

04:32.762 --> 04:34.695
What did I tell you
about answering the door?

04:35.632 --> 04:36.731
<i>Go back inside.</i>

04:44.675 --> 04:46.076
Cute kid.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.513
She yours?

04:50.213 --> 04:53.682
Can I help you?

04:53.684 --> 04:58.752
Yeah, I've got some trash,
need taken care of.

04:58.754 --> 05:01.156
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
You should call

05:01.158 --> 05:03.093
the sanitation department.

05:04.124 --> 05:07.262
No, no, no, no.
Chino told me what you do,

05:07.264 --> 05:12.534
and I need it done.

05:12.536 --> 05:13.868
This is not a drive through.

05:13.870 --> 05:17.505
Motherfucker, do I look like
I want fries with that?

05:29.887 --> 05:31.889
<i>So...</i>

05:33.824 --> 05:34.788
We good?

05:38.629 --> 05:42.200
It's Lieutenant.
We're settling vendettas.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.300
Don't worry, old man.
There won't be any blood

05:45.302 --> 05:46.767
back on you.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.106
<i>What's this?</i>

05:53.009 --> 05:55.709
Excuse me?

05:55.711 --> 05:58.747
It's no kids. Look at him.
He's just a boy.

05:58.749 --> 05:59.813
Not no more he ain't.

06:00.783 --> 06:02.651
No, I'm not going to take him.
Look at him.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.219
There's no kids.
That's the rule. No kids.

06:04.221 --> 06:05.753
The rule, we know
the rules.

06:05.755 --> 06:07.721
You're in, and you're going
to do what needs

06:07.723 --> 06:08.656
to get done.

06:09.459 --> 06:10.759
There's no other way out,
old man.

06:10.761 --> 06:11.192
No.

06:11.194 --> 06:12.629
Nah, there is.

06:13.863 --> 06:15.195
Do it for your daughter.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.300
Excuse me?

06:20.237 --> 06:24.706
If not for you, do it
for your daughter.

06:24.708 --> 06:27.742
<i>Like I said,
she's a cute kid.</i>

06:30.846 --> 06:33.048
Look, my man.
So, we good?

06:38.055 --> 06:39.120
Hey!

06:41.824 --> 06:44.625
Bodies are staying.
The money?

06:44.627 --> 06:49.964
Well, that can go
either way.

06:49.966 --> 06:53.834
<i>We both know you don't
really got an option here.</i>

07:28.038 --> 07:31.305
So, what's their story?

07:31.307 --> 07:35.709
It doesn't matter.

07:35.711 --> 07:37.646
Can I help?

07:59.970 --> 08:01.135
That's enough
for tonight.

12:33.109 --> 12:35.709
Okay, I want you to calm down.
Just calm down.

12:41.717 --> 12:42.583
No.

12:44.287 --> 12:46.119
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:46.121 --> 12:47.488
No, no.

13:35.638 --> 13:38.542
Don't worry, I'll fix this.

13:49.284 --> 13:51.084
You best hope
he comes through on this.

13:51.086 --> 13:53.021
<i>Yeah, fuck you.</i>

13:53.023 --> 13:55.422
He's going to make things right.

13:55.424 --> 13:57.593
What if he doesn't
come back?

14:00.263 --> 14:03.434
Then we go in
after him.

14:18.514 --> 14:19.546
Shit!

14:20.582 --> 14:21.681
Ah!

16:03.919 --> 16:06.219
If you don't calm down,
you're going to rip

16:06.221 --> 16:06.820
your stitches open.

16:07.923 --> 16:08.756
<i>Just stop it.</i>

16:08.758 --> 16:11.559
You're just going to
make it worse.

16:11.561 --> 16:13.761
<i>Calm down. You've
already lost a lot of blood.</i>

16:13.763 --> 16:15.162
Calm down. Calm down.

16:19.668 --> 16:22.670
Easy now. Easy now.

16:28.644 --> 16:29.944
She ruined Mom's dress.

16:32.514 --> 16:35.215
It'll wash out.

16:35.217 --> 16:37.384
That won't make a difference.

17:20.829 --> 17:22.496
<i>You left blood
on the floor.</i>

17:24.866 --> 17:27.336
<i>You have to be
more careful.</i>

17:34.309 --> 17:35.945
So, what should we do
with her?

17:37.313 --> 17:40.547
Well, just, just make sure
that she's okay.

17:40.549 --> 17:42.318
And then what?

17:42.951 --> 17:44.986
Because I don't like her.

17:44.988 --> 17:47.354
She's just scared.

17:47.356 --> 17:50.293
Mom wouldn't want her here
either.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.692
Well, she wouldn't.

17:52.694 --> 17:53.526
It's fine.

17:53.528 --> 17:54.527
You always say these people
are bad.

17:54.529 --> 17:57.331
What if she's bad,
and she wants to hurt us?

17:57.333 --> 17:58.699
Well, she's tied up.

17:58.701 --> 18:00.470
<i>What if she's dangerous?
You don't even know her.</i>

18:01.270 --> 18:02.436
Mom wouldn't want her...

18:02.438 --> 18:04.374
Well, she isn't here, is she?

18:05.842 --> 18:07.440
You should have let her die.

18:07.442 --> 18:12.950
Hey! Gloria, I'm not a monster.

18:13.982 --> 18:16.787
You melt people
in the back room.

18:18.288 --> 18:23.923
Dead people. Look, if we didn't
save that girl,

18:23.925 --> 18:26.794
we'd be no better
than they are.

18:26.796 --> 18:28.662
You understand?

18:29.999 --> 18:31.699
Yeah?

18:31.701 --> 18:32.732
Okay, Dad.

18:32.734 --> 18:33.668
Okay.

18:41.877 --> 18:44.511
<i>If we get finished
early, might be able to have</i>

18:44.513 --> 18:46.415
some ice cream.

19:03.766 --> 19:05.969
<i>Gloria?</i>

19:08.704 --> 19:11.971
He's here.

19:11.973 --> 19:13.574
<i>There's nothing there.</i>

19:21.651 --> 19:23.049
<i>There's nothing there.</i>

19:24.053 --> 19:26.519
<i>You're imagining things
again.</i>

19:26.521 --> 19:29.890
They're here. I can see them
everywhere.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.500
Did you calm down
a little bit?

20:18.740 --> 20:22.846
I will take the gag off
if we have an understanding.

20:24.513 --> 20:26.846
<i>Don't question where
you are, why you're here,</i>

20:26.848 --> 20:28.716
<i>when you can leave.</i>

20:28.718 --> 20:30.750
<i>And don't scream.
Nobody will hear you.</i>

20:30.752 --> 20:36.559
If you scream, the gag goes back
on, and doesn't come off.

20:37.926 --> 20:41.464
My daughter lives here.

20:42.731 --> 20:44.965
<i>You put her in danger
in any way,</i>

20:44.967 --> 20:49.702
you will wish I let you die.
Do you understand?

20:52.107 --> 20:54.007
Do you understand?

20:59.949 --> 21:02.385
I guess not yet.

21:08.758 --> 21:09.925
<i>That's my mom's dress,
you know.</i>

21:11.027 --> 21:13.494
Just don't get too comfortable
in it.

21:13.496 --> 21:15.796
<i>We should get
a few things straight.</i>

21:15.798 --> 21:19.199
This is not your house,
and you're not our guest.

21:19.201 --> 21:21.701
You're not allowed in my room,
you're not allowed to borrow

21:21.703 --> 21:25.706
my clothes, my books,
or my Cutie Pie doll.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.775
<i>You're not allowed
to touch my colored pens</i>

21:27.777 --> 21:31.511
<i>without permission,
and most importantly,</i>

21:31.513 --> 21:38.151
you are never, ever, ever going
to touch my toothbrush.

21:40.623 --> 21:42.122
It's pink and blue.

21:45.728 --> 21:48.761
Just nod if you understand.

21:53.935 --> 21:59.105
Can I touch them?
Your earrings.

21:59.107 --> 22:00.641
They're beautiful.

22:04.113 --> 22:05.645
He can't hear you.

22:10.653 --> 22:14.822
You can have them.

22:14.824 --> 22:16.660
Really?

22:19.028 --> 22:20.661
No, I can't.

22:20.663 --> 22:24.901
No, no, no. Go ahead.
Go ahead.

22:26.134 --> 22:29.670
Oh, no. Your father won't
notice. Don't worry.

22:29.672 --> 22:31.538
How do you know?

22:31.540 --> 22:33.806
Men don't notice
things like that.

22:36.045 --> 22:40.247
<i>Come on. Come on,
they're pretty, right?</i>

22:40.249 --> 22:43.653
Oh, they're going to look
so good on you.

22:44.886 --> 22:46.286
<i>This one.</i>

22:47.823 --> 22:48.956
<i>That's it.</i>

22:52.894 --> 22:57.931
Yeah, they're pretty, huh?

22:57.933 --> 22:58.731
Yeah.

22:58.733 --> 23:00.334
Mm-hmm.

23:00.336 --> 23:04.238
No, no, please don't put it
back. Just for a little while.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.706
<i>It's hard to breathe.</i>

23:07.343 --> 23:10.777
Little girl, can you undo
these hand ties?

23:10.779 --> 23:12.779
They really hurt.

23:12.781 --> 23:17.918
My name is Gloria.
Don't call me little girl.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.720
<i>Gloria!
That's a nice name.</i>

23:20.722 --> 23:26.059
My name is Jackie. Could you
undo these hand ties, please?

23:26.061 --> 23:27.928
Please?

23:27.930 --> 23:30.663
<i>Come on, just one
of them. Please.</i>

23:32.067 --> 23:36.135
<i>Gloria, come on.</i>

23:36.137 --> 23:38.838
Thank you for
the earrings.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.873
<i>No.</i>

24:21.817 --> 24:26.819
<i>Mom wouldn't want her
here. I don't want her here.</i>

24:28.691 --> 24:30.857
<i>I just wish she
would go.</i>

24:30.859 --> 24:32.159
<i>She doesn't belong here.</i>

24:33.296 --> 24:36.796
<i>All she does is cry
and scream.</i>

24:36.798 --> 24:41.203
Anyways, he thinks bribing me
will get me to like her.

24:42.038 --> 24:43.836
<i>He's mistaken.</i>

24:49.679 --> 24:51.245
They are nice, though.

24:57.686 --> 25:05.124
It's okay. You'll get used to it
here. I promise.

25:44.432 --> 25:45.498
Gloria!

25:45.500 --> 25:47.034
Breakfast!

25:54.143 --> 25:55.174
Gloria!

26:03.786 --> 26:05.151
Aren't they pretty, Daddy?

26:05.153 --> 26:06.789
<i>Gloria.</i>

26:08.857 --> 26:11.057
What, what have you done?

26:11.059 --> 26:12.825
Where did you get these?

26:12.827 --> 26:13.927
Jackie gave them to me.

26:15.498 --> 26:18.931
Who's Jackie?
Jackie.

26:28.778 --> 26:31.545
What the hell are you thinking,
giving a little twelve year old

26:31.547 --> 26:32.347
those...

26:33.782 --> 26:35.181
<i>Jackie.</i>

26:43.792 --> 26:45.392
Gloria!

26:46.261 --> 26:48.428
I need you to go and get
my emergency kit

26:48.430 --> 26:50.497
from the basement.
It's a white, metal box,

26:50.499 --> 26:52.799
and it's right on the left,
near the wall.

26:52.801 --> 26:54.834
Gloria!

26:54.836 --> 26:55.434
The basement?

26:55.436 --> 26:56.236
Yeah.

26:56.238 --> 26:57.203
No.

26:57.205 --> 26:58.205
Gloria.

26:58.207 --> 26:59.405
Mm-mm.

26:59.407 --> 27:02.042
She's in trouble.
Now go and get it!

27:02.044 --> 27:03.376
Hurry up!

27:09.050 --> 27:10.183
<i>Gloria!</i>

28:41.544 --> 28:43.576
Put it down there,
put it down there.

28:52.554 --> 28:54.086
Is that going to work?

28:54.088 --> 28:56.189
I'm O negative.
We're going to find out.

29:00.261 --> 29:01.561
<i>Jackie, come on.</i>

29:06.234 --> 29:08.567
<i>Please.</i>

29:08.569 --> 29:10.536
I got, I got something.

29:10.538 --> 29:11.571
You got something?

29:25.721 --> 29:28.521
<i>I don't meet many
good people anymore.</i>

29:28.523 --> 29:32.726
<i>Maybe that's why my dad's
trying so hard to be one.</i>

29:32.728 --> 29:34.460
<i>I think Jackie will be okay.</i>

29:35.730 --> 29:40.100
<i>But my mother's dress
won't. It's stained.</i>

29:40.102 --> 29:43.269
<i>I don't want him to burn it,
but blood leaves a trail,</i>

29:43.271 --> 29:49.276
<i>and we have rules here.
Still, Mom loved that dress.</i>

29:53.015 --> 29:56.449
<i>Daddy says Jackie's
just scared.</i>

29:56.451 --> 29:59.652
<i>I'm not sure why she would be
afraid of us.</i>

29:59.654 --> 30:03.523
<i>We're just a normal family...
normal for me, I guess.</i>

30:19.641 --> 30:21.444
<i>You're awake.</i>

30:22.344 --> 30:23.947
I'm glad.

30:25.079 --> 30:29.085
Careful. You pulled
your stitches out.

30:30.451 --> 30:34.457
By the time my dad found you,
you were really white.

30:36.025 --> 30:38.392
Sometimes I don't know
what's good for me, you know?

30:38.394 --> 30:42.028
<i>Here.
I got you some water.</i>

30:42.030 --> 30:43.966
Thank you.

30:53.575 --> 30:56.375
Is that your mom?

30:56.377 --> 30:57.746
Yeah.

30:59.181 --> 31:02.548
Does she know what your dad's
got you into?

31:02.550 --> 31:07.554
She would never let my dad
keep bodies in the house.

31:12.094 --> 31:16.630
Leukemia makes people
really sad. You know?

31:16.632 --> 31:19.102
Yeah, it does.

31:22.403 --> 31:24.039
Those look really nice on you.

31:25.406 --> 31:31.611
I did it this morning.
Yeah, my dad wasn't too happy.

31:31.613 --> 31:33.646
He said I've got to
take them out,

31:33.648 --> 31:37.552
but I wanted to
show you first.

31:39.654 --> 31:41.121
I should go get him.

31:41.123 --> 31:43.457
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, you don't have...</i>

31:43.459 --> 31:44.257
Don't.

31:44.259 --> 31:46.660
He'll want to know
you're awake.

31:46.662 --> 31:49.563
Yeah, but just wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:49.565 --> 31:50.663
You don't need to.

31:50.665 --> 31:53.132
Dad! She's awake.

32:00.308 --> 32:02.478
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

32:07.648 --> 32:09.716
Sounds like you're more
talkative with my daughter.

32:15.790 --> 32:17.690
What are you going to do
with me?

32:17.692 --> 32:19.659
I have no plans
to hurt you.

32:19.661 --> 32:21.628
Then why can't I go?

32:21.630 --> 32:24.331
Well, the people that dropped
you off, I'm assuming

32:24.333 --> 32:27.467
they wanted you dead.

32:27.469 --> 32:30.636
They might not appreciate me
ruining their plans.

32:30.638 --> 32:33.373
<i>Dropped me off here.
Why here?</i>

32:33.375 --> 32:35.709
<i>That's what people do.</i>

32:35.711 --> 32:37.811
They dump dead bodies
at my door.

32:41.583 --> 32:46.219
Wait. You're him.

32:46.221 --> 32:47.386
Hmm?

32:47.388 --> 32:50.489
You're that Candy Man guy,
aren't you?

32:50.491 --> 32:52.324
The Candy Butcher.

32:52.326 --> 32:55.394
Oh, my God. You're not going to
fucking eat me, are you?

32:55.396 --> 32:59.632
<i>The group that brought
you, and a couple of others,</i>

32:59.634 --> 33:01.567
thought you were dead.

33:01.569 --> 33:06.273
Others with...
Was my boyfriend with me?

33:06.275 --> 33:09.176
He has a tattoo under his eye,
like a cross.

33:09.178 --> 33:10.509
<i>Did you see him?</i>

33:10.511 --> 33:11.244
No.

33:17.286 --> 33:21.857
What now? What, are you going
to, like, fuck me or something?

33:24.192 --> 33:28.562
If I leave that gag off,
can you please behave?

33:28.564 --> 33:30.430
I ain't going nowhere.

33:30.432 --> 33:33.603
You won't have to stay here
much longer, anyway.

33:34.803 --> 33:37.636
<i>I'm glad you're okay.</i>

33:54.423 --> 33:55.588
<i>There you go.</i>

33:57.826 --> 34:01.361
<i>To sunrises,
and sunsets.</i>

34:03.965 --> 34:08.304
To sunrises,
and sunsets.

34:09.737 --> 34:13.672
One day you're going to be
too old for milk and cookies.

34:15.376 --> 34:16.574
<i>How come?</i>

34:17.746 --> 34:19.646
You're not.

34:26.688 --> 34:27.753
Hey, Dad.

34:27.755 --> 34:28.987
Yeah.

34:28.989 --> 34:32.324
Are you going to miss it here?

34:32.327 --> 34:36.027
Well, we're going to take
the good parts,

34:36.030 --> 34:37.731
keep them up here.

34:45.507 --> 34:47.039
How much packing
do you have left?

34:47.041 --> 34:48.907
Not much.

34:48.909 --> 34:49.675
Okay.

34:55.349 --> 34:55.981
Hey, Dad.

34:55.983 --> 34:58.517
Yeah?

34:58.519 --> 35:00.586
I was thinking...

35:00.588 --> 35:02.755
Yeah.

35:02.757 --> 35:07.994
That maybe Jackie
could come with us?

35:11.900 --> 35:14.434
No, I don't,
I don't think so.

35:14.436 --> 35:16.036
Why not?

35:16.038 --> 35:18.637
Well, I don't think
she'd want to.

35:18.639 --> 35:21.740
I think she would.
I think she needs us.

35:29.717 --> 35:31.617
Tell me again
about El Paso.

35:34.422 --> 35:35.789
El Paso.

35:39.594 --> 35:43.396
As dawn breaks, the sun peeks
over the mountains,

35:43.398 --> 35:46.800
and casts long shadows
over the desert.

35:46.802 --> 35:52.505
And the clean air tastes
like spring shower

35:52.507 --> 35:54.007
after a long rain.

35:56.644 --> 35:58.077
<i>And no snow.</i>

36:00.349 --> 36:01.680
<i>No snow.</i>

36:13.894 --> 36:16.028
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

36:16.030 --> 36:22.668
I'm okay. You sure know how
to sew up a bullet hole.

36:22.670 --> 36:25.573
<i>My daughter's dolls
give me a lot of practice.</i>

36:26.675 --> 36:28.544
<i>May I?</i>

36:30.545 --> 36:31.813
Alright.

36:37.719 --> 36:39.753
You know, from the stories
on the street,

36:39.755 --> 36:42.121
you don't seem like the type.

36:42.123 --> 36:45.627
I hope not.
It's not my choice.

36:46.427 --> 36:48.530
Then why do you do it?

36:49.731 --> 36:54.534
I didn't want to. It just,
it just happened.

36:54.536 --> 37:01.010
I was, I was married once.
Happy.

37:01.742 --> 37:03.679
She was beautiful.

37:05.012 --> 37:08.715
Anyway, she got really sick.
Leukemia.

37:08.717 --> 37:14.954
One night she was at a
hospital, at the hospital,

37:14.956 --> 37:18.791
and this guy came to my door.
His buddy had gotten shot

37:18.793 --> 37:24.097
in a hunting accident,
and he needed my help.

37:24.099 --> 37:29.936
I did what I could,
but he was too far gone.

37:29.938 --> 37:33.139
And he died right there
on my table.

37:33.141 --> 37:35.742
So, when I tried to call
the police,

37:35.744 --> 37:38.012
the first guy pulled
a gun on me.

37:39.114 --> 37:41.981
They weren't,
they weren't hunters.

37:41.983 --> 37:43.983
There was some kind of trouble,
a robbery gone bad.

37:48.088 --> 37:54.561
The guy held us here for days,
hiding from the cops.

37:54.563 --> 37:59.566
Eventually, his buddy's body
started to rot.

37:59.568 --> 38:03.939
I got this wood stove
in the basement.

38:06.608 --> 38:07.977
I burned his body in that.

38:09.110 --> 38:10.776
<i>What happened
to the guy?</i>

38:14.548 --> 38:18.851
When the streets cleared,
he peeled $10,000 off

38:18.853 --> 38:22.722
the money that they stole,
and he gave it to me.

38:22.724 --> 38:31.097
He said I was on retainer,
and that if I called the police

38:31.099 --> 38:34.537
he'd send his people
after my daughter.

38:35.737 --> 38:38.137
In the end it was actually
kind of a relief.

38:38.139 --> 38:41.139
I was... We couldn't afford
to keep up with the cancer,

38:41.141 --> 38:45.043
I was going to lose this farm.
It was...

38:45.045 --> 38:46.713
<i>Necessary.</i>

38:49.050 --> 38:50.816
Then Abby died.

38:53.889 --> 38:57.757
And the bodies kept coming.

38:57.759 --> 39:03.896
I couldn't do anything.
If I refused, Gloria would never

39:03.898 --> 39:05.597
be safe.

39:10.704 --> 39:17.480
She's seen so much death here.
This house.

39:18.713 --> 39:22.849
She even says that she sees
them sometimes,

39:22.851 --> 39:30.889
that the house is... I have got
to get her out of here.

39:38.567 --> 39:42.101
Alright, so, anyway,
what about you?

39:42.103 --> 39:44.570
How do you do it?

39:44.572 --> 39:45.905
Do what?

39:45.907 --> 39:48.807
<i>Well, generally, good
people don't come here.</i>

39:48.809 --> 39:50.645
Dead or alive.

39:51.913 --> 39:54.780
You stitch me up, and now
you think you know me?

39:54.782 --> 39:57.816
<i>I know bangers.
They're all the same.</i>

39:57.818 --> 40:00.853
Drugs, money, death,
rinse, repeat.

40:00.855 --> 40:04.057
Yeah, I don't think you're
the type to be preaching.

40:04.059 --> 40:06.758
You know what?
On that one we agree.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.595
I never killed nobody.

40:08.597 --> 40:10.862
Maybe, maybe not.

40:10.864 --> 40:13.766
<i>What about you?
You cut up people in the back.</i>

40:13.768 --> 40:14.900
They're already dead.

40:14.902 --> 40:16.869
<i>Oh, is that what
you tell yourself?</i>

40:16.871 --> 40:19.639
<i>I'm doing what I have
to to get by.</i>

40:19.641 --> 40:21.139
<i>Yeah, well, so am I.</i>

40:22.376 --> 40:26.713
We've all lost people, okay?
You think you're the only person

40:26.715 --> 40:30.883
ever forced into a lifestyle?
Dead bodies or not,

40:30.885 --> 40:36.322
you think this is the hard life?
You don't know shit.

40:36.324 --> 40:38.657
You go out there one week,
and then you come

40:38.659 --> 40:41.327
and talk to me about
the hard life.

40:41.329 --> 40:44.731
<i>You don't know me,
or any of the people you cut up.</i>

40:44.733 --> 40:48.637
You have no right to judge me,
or what I do.

40:49.938 --> 40:52.771
I don't chop up strangers
for a living now, do I?

40:56.710 --> 40:58.276
Get some rest.

41:17.931 --> 41:19.766
Do you think Jackie
should come with us?

41:22.170 --> 41:25.003
You know, she's not as bad
as she used to be.

41:27.842 --> 41:29.441
But it's nice to have
her around.

41:43.724 --> 41:48.663
That's very nice of you to say,
but I have to leave.

41:49.797 --> 41:55.068
<i>But yes,
I'll miss you, too.</i>

43:23.925 --> 43:26.191
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

43:30.864 --> 43:34.833
Oh, no. Sweetie, come here.
Come here.

43:34.835 --> 43:36.869
Come here. Come here.

43:40.041 --> 43:41.507
How old are you?

43:41.509 --> 43:47.313
Twelve.

43:47.315 --> 43:50.282
Nothing's wrong with you, okay?
You're perfect.

43:52.853 --> 43:53.952
Yeah.

43:55.389 --> 43:57.889
Don't worry.
You're going to be fine.

44:00.594 --> 44:03.162
You know, I can help you,
but you just need to get

44:03.164 --> 44:06.264
something for me.

44:06.266 --> 44:07.833
Okay?

44:07.835 --> 44:09.168
Okay.

45:47.001 --> 45:49.601
Yes, yes, okay.
Open it up.

45:49.603 --> 45:50.670
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:50.672 --> 45:52.304
Open it up, dump it out
on the bed.

45:53.141 --> 45:55.474
It's probably at the bottom.
Yeah.

46:01.349 --> 46:05.617
<i>That's it. That's it.
Now open it up.</i>

46:10.224 --> 46:15.094
<i>You got your period.
Listen, this happens</i>

46:15.096 --> 46:18.563
to all girls. Okay?

46:19.833 --> 46:23.536
<i>If you have any
problems, just come back.</i>

46:23.538 --> 46:25.137
<i>Got it?</i>

46:25.139 --> 46:25.704
Got it.

46:33.014 --> 46:34.246
Thank you.

47:22.597 --> 47:24.232
Hello?

47:24.731 --> 47:26.331
<i>Hello?</i>

47:26.333 --> 47:29.070
Baby, baby, is that you?

47:29.536 --> 47:31.302
Wait, Jackie?

47:31.304 --> 47:33.572
Oh, baby, I need your help,
okay? I don't know

47:33.574 --> 47:35.574
what he's going to do to me.

47:35.576 --> 47:38.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.

47:38.713 --> 47:39.778
Where are you?
Are you okay?

47:39.780 --> 47:42.715
I don't, I don't know, okay.
He's got me tied up.

47:42.717 --> 47:44.650
I don't know what
he's going to do.

47:44.652 --> 47:46.452
<i>Who, Jackie?
Who tied you up?</i>

47:46.454 --> 47:50.688
The Candy Butcher.
He's real, baby. He's real.

47:50.690 --> 47:52.425
<i>He's real,
and he's here.</i>

47:52.427 --> 47:53.659
Are you sure?

47:53.661 --> 47:55.293
<i>Come get me, okay?</i>

47:55.295 --> 48:00.166
Okay, okay, okay. Calm down.
Um, Jackie, where are you?

48:00.168 --> 48:02.267
<i>I don't know.
Like, a farm, I think.</i>

48:02.269 --> 48:03.168
I'm not sure.

48:03.170 --> 48:05.104
Okay, that's, that's good.

48:05.106 --> 48:06.738
<i>Carter, I'm scared.</i>

48:06.740 --> 48:08.840
I know, baby. I know.
Look, you just,

48:08.842 --> 48:11.409
you got to be strong, okay?

48:11.411 --> 48:12.478
I'm coming for you.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.746
How are you going to find me?

48:13.748 --> 48:16.115
<i>I'll find you.
Just, just don't do anything</i>

48:16.117 --> 48:17.715
<i>that's going to piss this guy
off, alright?</i>

48:17.717 --> 48:18.717
Okay.

48:18.719 --> 48:19.552
<i>You promise?</i>

48:19.554 --> 48:21.119
Yeah, I promise.

48:21.121 --> 48:24.757
Okay, now get off the phone
before he finds you.

48:24.759 --> 48:26.691
I love you.

48:26.693 --> 48:28.797
I love you, too.

48:38.606 --> 48:39.338
Oh!

48:49.583 --> 48:50.749
Gloria, baby?

48:50.751 --> 48:51.617
Baby, what happened?

48:51.619 --> 48:52.385
Dad, stop.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.519
Baby, what happened?
Are you...

48:53.521 --> 48:54.487
Dad, stop.

48:54.489 --> 48:55.653
No, don't move.
Let me just...

48:55.655 --> 48:56.722
No, no, no, no, no.

48:56.724 --> 48:58.724
...have a look. Let me just see
what's happening.

48:58.726 --> 48:59.425
Dad! Dad!

48:59.427 --> 49:00.793
Baby, let me just take a look.

49:00.795 --> 49:03.264
Dad! I'm a girl, alright!
It happens!

49:09.369 --> 49:11.572
Oh, well...

49:12.606 --> 49:14.608
Oh, I, um...

49:19.780 --> 49:22.317
Oh, baby. I, uh...

49:23.550 --> 49:24.816
I'm...

49:36.563 --> 49:37.595
Where'd you get this?

49:37.597 --> 49:38.496
<i>It was...</i>

49:38.498 --> 49:39.565
Where did you get this?!

49:39.567 --> 49:41.566
<i>It was, it was in
my purse.</i>

49:41.568 --> 49:42.635
How did you get it?

49:42.637 --> 49:43.135
I'm sorry.

49:43.137 --> 49:43.702
<i>How?</i>

49:43.704 --> 49:44.670
I'm sorry, I was just...

49:44.672 --> 49:47.273
You were just what, huh?
You were just what?

49:47.275 --> 49:48.840
<i>What is it you were
just doing?</i>

49:48.842 --> 49:49.842
Helping me, Dad.

49:49.844 --> 49:51.911
<i>She was just
helping me.</i>

49:53.313 --> 49:55.750
Thanks for being
so understanding.

50:01.489 --> 50:05.691
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to help her.

50:05.693 --> 50:08.463
Unless you have some
pads lying around.

50:09.597 --> 50:14.200
She is not supposed
to be in here.

50:14.202 --> 50:15.733
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

50:20.641 --> 50:22.575
Thank you.

50:32.686 --> 50:33.786
Fuck!

50:44.364 --> 50:45.363
Yo!

50:47.835 --> 50:49.702
<i>Yo, wait your turn</i>.

50:49.704 --> 50:51.737
<i>You stupid
son of a bitch.</i>

50:51.739 --> 50:52.804
What? What's wrong with you?

50:52.806 --> 50:54.639
<i>Yo, bitch,
get the fuck out.</i>

50:54.641 --> 50:56.641
<i>Oh, come on.
No, wait. Wait.</i>

50:56.643 --> 50:59.577
<i>Yo, bitch,
get the fuck out!</i>

50:59.579 --> 51:02.615
Hurry up! Get the fuck out!
You deaf?

51:02.617 --> 51:05.251
Yo, why is it that my girlfriend
just called me, Reggie?

51:05.253 --> 51:06.885
You know, because that shit
usually doesn't happen

51:06.887 --> 51:08.253
to bitches already dead.

51:08.255 --> 51:09.655
What?

51:09.657 --> 51:11.523
<i>Yo, answer my question
with a question one more time,</i>

51:11.525 --> 51:12.958
motherfucker, and I'll put
a bullet in your head,

51:12.960 --> 51:14.126
you understand?

51:14.128 --> 51:16.528
<i>Yo, chill. Chill out,
buddy. Alright?</i>

51:16.530 --> 51:20.666
I took care of it. She's dead.
I dropped her off at a place.

51:20.668 --> 51:21.633
At a place.

51:21.635 --> 51:22.601
Yeah.

51:22.603 --> 51:25.436
Let me guess, a farm?
It's a farm, right?

51:25.438 --> 51:27.639
Yeah. How did you know that?

51:27.641 --> 51:30.742
Because the bitch just
fucking told me, bro!

51:30.744 --> 51:34.345
Yo, Chino thinks my entire crew
got killed in that hijack.

51:34.347 --> 51:36.048
If Jackie tells him
that I'm still alive,

51:36.050 --> 51:38.983
he's going to know that I took
his money. And if he finds out

51:38.985 --> 51:41.653
about our little side project
here, that's me and you

51:41.655 --> 51:43.755
in that butcher's fucking
bathtub, Reggie.

51:43.757 --> 51:45.657
<i>Well, then I'll fucking
take care of it.</i>

51:45.659 --> 51:48.661
Take care of it like you took
care of it before? Huh?

51:48.663 --> 51:49.894
I will handle it!

51:49.896 --> 51:51.563
<i>Just shut the fuck up.</i>

51:54.635 --> 51:57.001
Yeah, it's me, yo.
I need a pick up in an hour.

51:57.003 --> 51:59.671
<i>Yeah, bring DeMarco,
too, and yo, bring heat.</i>

51:59.673 --> 52:00.738
<i>Everything you got.</i>

52:02.610 --> 52:04.909
Just hurry the fuck up,
Reggie.

52:25.666 --> 52:30.405
Gloria, Gloria,
look at me, please.

52:32.873 --> 52:35.673
<i>I just want to say
I'm sorry about last night.</i>

52:35.675 --> 52:38.644
<i>I heard a gun shot,
I saw you with the...</i>

52:38.646 --> 52:40.749
I really don't want
to talk about it.

52:41.548 --> 52:46.487
Okay. Fine.
Alright.

52:49.356 --> 52:51.956
I'm just saying, if you ever do
want to talk about it...

52:51.958 --> 52:52.760
Dad.

52:54.494 --> 52:56.463
Okay.

53:00.768 --> 53:03.668
Can Jackie come out
for breakfast?

53:03.670 --> 53:07.908
I mean, I don't think
that's a good idea.

53:11.778 --> 53:13.612
Why not?

53:13.614 --> 53:14.746
Because.

53:14.748 --> 53:16.317
Because why?

53:17.550 --> 53:23.588
I just, I don't really think
she belongs here.

53:23.590 --> 53:26.425
Then where does she belong?

53:34.168 --> 53:36.034
Would you like some cereal,
Jackie?

53:37.737 --> 53:40.738
It's high in fiber.

53:40.740 --> 53:42.141
Sure, thanks.

53:45.780 --> 53:48.947
You know, I recommend it
with milk.

53:50.885 --> 53:53.855
My dad takes it straight.

53:54.855 --> 53:57.722
I'll try the milk.

53:57.724 --> 53:59.594
Good choice.

54:14.474 --> 54:16.474
To sunrises, and sunsets.

54:21.114 --> 54:23.215
To sunrises, and sunsets.

54:37.063 --> 54:43.769
So, Gloria, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

54:43.771 --> 54:46.472
<i>I'm not sure yet.
At first, I thought I wanted</i>

54:46.474 --> 54:50.608
to be a doctor,
to help people, you know?

54:50.610 --> 54:53.144
Then I was thinking I could
maybe do what my dad does.

54:59.920 --> 55:06.157
Oh! Not that part, just the
raising farm animals part.

55:06.159 --> 55:08.663
But it would just be
a milk farm.

55:09.496 --> 55:11.863
<i>No more death.</i>

55:11.865 --> 55:13.735
Right, Dad?

55:15.168 --> 55:18.135
Dad says when we get to El Paso,
we don't have to deal with

55:18.137 --> 55:20.607
dead people anymore.

55:27.047 --> 55:28.550
<i>Dad says you get to
go home today,</i>

55:29.849 --> 55:32.650
but I'm trying to convince him
to let you come with us.

55:32.652 --> 55:35.489
<i>Alright, Gloria,
that's enough.</i>

55:36.757 --> 55:39.691
Could you bring your suitcases
down now, please?

55:39.693 --> 55:43.832
I need to speak to Jackie.

55:44.164 --> 55:45.834
Yeah.

55:55.309 --> 55:56.242
When you've finished
your breakfast,

55:56.244 --> 55:58.709
I'm going to take you back
in your room,

55:58.711 --> 56:00.945
and I'm going to give you
a sedative.

56:00.947 --> 56:03.682
When you wake up,
me and my daughter

56:03.684 --> 56:07.286
will be long gone.
You'll be free to go.

56:07.288 --> 56:08.787
But you've got to promise me
something.

56:10.257 --> 56:15.760
You've never seen us before.
The last thing you remember,

56:15.762 --> 56:18.697
you got shot, and you woke up
in a ditch somewhere.

56:18.699 --> 56:20.097
You understand?

56:20.099 --> 56:21.067
Mm-hmm.

56:22.735 --> 56:24.769
The only thing I care about
in the whole world

56:24.771 --> 56:26.938
is that little girl.
I want you to promise me

56:26.940 --> 56:29.273
that you're not going to put her
in any danger.

56:29.275 --> 56:31.742
If you let me go,
I will never speak of you

56:31.744 --> 56:32.978
or your daughter ever again.

56:42.722 --> 56:44.222
Okay.

56:47.193 --> 56:49.226
You got a good kid.

56:51.831 --> 56:52.498
Yeah.

56:57.972 --> 57:02.673
Okay, I'm ready.
So, you coming, Jackie?

57:02.675 --> 57:03.775
I...

57:03.777 --> 57:06.845
No, Jackie's got a, she's got
a life to live here.

57:06.847 --> 57:10.014
Yeah. I've got a boyfriend,
and I've got to get back to him.

57:10.016 --> 57:11.849
A boyfriend?

57:11.851 --> 57:14.353
<i>Yeah.</i>

57:14.355 --> 57:16.822
I hope he treats you good.

57:18.826 --> 57:20.626
<i>Daddy always says
if you love someone,</i>

57:20.628 --> 57:22.059
<i>you should appreciate them
every single day.</i>

57:23.429 --> 57:25.731
<i>Because you never know
when something's going to</i>

57:25.733 --> 57:26.664
<i>take them away from you.</i>

57:29.802 --> 57:31.802
<i>Okay, okay. Put the
suitcases in the car.</i>

57:37.110 --> 57:38.744
Now, let's get this
cleared up.

58:14.815 --> 58:16.280
Gloria, come inside.

58:16.951 --> 58:17.949
<i>One second, Dad.</i>

58:17.951 --> 58:18.816
Gloria, now!

58:30.230 --> 58:31.329
Who is that?

58:31.331 --> 58:32.831
<i>Take Jackie
to her room, now.</i>

59:23.784 --> 59:24.849
Gloria, go to your room.

59:24.851 --> 59:26.217
But Dad, we were just...

59:26.219 --> 59:27.284
Go to your room!

59:30.224 --> 59:31.255
Alright, who's Carter?

59:31.257 --> 59:32.557
What?

59:32.559 --> 59:35.327
<i>Just don't. Who's here?
What did you tell them?</i>

59:35.329 --> 59:36.260
What do you mean?

59:36.262 --> 59:37.262
Who?!

59:37.264 --> 59:39.030
He's my boyfriend, okay!
I called my boyfriend!

59:39.032 --> 59:40.865
But he's not here
to hurt anyone.

59:40.867 --> 59:42.133
<i>Oh.</i>

59:42.135 --> 59:46.804
Please, just let me talk to him!
I just want to get out of here.

59:46.806 --> 59:48.106
You're not the only one.

01:00:09.496 --> 01:00:11.796
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:00:14.034 --> 01:00:17.536
Hey, yo, Candy.
How's business?

01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:20.070
I'm not looking for any,
if that's what you're asking.

01:00:20.072 --> 01:00:22.039
Yeah, you never are.
You never are.

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:25.943
Why is that? I mean,
we're good customers, right?

01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:29.146
Right? I mean,
we pay on time.

01:00:29.148 --> 01:00:30.882
<i>So, where's the love?</i>

01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:32.583
Where's the fucking love?

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:34.885
Did you receive
a complaint?

01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:40.325
Now, that's funny.
That's funny.

01:00:40.327 --> 01:00:42.561
Hey, hey, Carter, did you know
that Butch here

01:00:42.563 --> 01:00:45.429
had a sense of humor?
Because, you know,

01:00:45.431 --> 01:00:46.565
dead bodies,
they can't complain.

01:00:46.567 --> 01:00:48.233
I get it.

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:52.336
Then why ain't you laughing?
Huh? You're not laughing.

01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:55.606
Hey, Butch, if it's funny,
why isn't he laughing?

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.474
Maybe I should work on
my delivery?

01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:08.887
Speaking of deliveries,
the last one we did,

01:01:08.889 --> 01:01:13.858
three bodies? Two guys,
and a chick?

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.025
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:22.633
Was there anything unusual
about that delivery?

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:25.070
Apart from the fact
that one of them wasn't dead?

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:32.510
Yeah.

01:01:32.512 --> 01:01:34.045
I'll go get her.

01:01:34.047 --> 01:01:35.179
Wait!

01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:36.514
<i>Wait!</i>

01:01:36.516 --> 01:01:39.950
Why the fuck didn't you tell me
she was still alive?

01:01:39.952 --> 01:01:43.320
<i>What was I supposed
to do?</i>

01:01:43.322 --> 01:01:45.559
Send you an email?

01:01:46.525 --> 01:01:48.459
Just go get her,
and hurry up.

01:01:48.461 --> 01:01:50.262
<i>We can take care
of this peacefully.</i>

01:01:55.135 --> 01:01:57.434
Get it over with.
I'll be in the car.

01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:09.179
Daddy, what's happening?

01:02:11.818 --> 01:02:14.519
Please, please,
they're going to kill me.

01:02:14.521 --> 01:02:16.420
<i>You asked for this.</i>

01:02:16.422 --> 01:02:18.523
You made the phone call!
You asked these guys,

01:02:18.525 --> 01:02:21.159
you invited them
to my home.

01:02:21.161 --> 01:02:24.028
To my home!
With my daughter here!

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.262
It's your fault!

01:02:26.565 --> 01:02:27.699
<i>No, please!
Please, please!</i>

01:02:27.701 --> 01:02:30.101
<i>No, Daddy,
I don't want her to go!</i>

01:02:30.103 --> 01:02:31.436
Gloria, go to your room!

01:02:31.438 --> 01:02:32.403
Daddy! Stop! Stop!

01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:33.271
Go!

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.376
<i>Please, please!</i>

01:02:42.548 --> 01:02:44.581
Hey, there she is!

01:02:52.092 --> 01:02:54.258
<i>Good to see you,
Jackie.</i>

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.461
Come on, Willy.
Send her on over.

01:02:58.465 --> 01:02:59.530
<i>Dad!</i>

01:03:01.702 --> 01:03:05.202
Willy, please, please, please.
You don't have to do this.

01:03:05.204 --> 01:03:06.704
Please, they're going
to kill me.

01:03:08.507 --> 01:03:12.209
<i>They're going
to kill me.</i>

01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:17.449
Don't worry. We'll send her
right back to you.

01:03:17.451 --> 01:03:19.684
You promise me my little girl's
not going to die today.

01:03:21.355 --> 01:03:24.755
<i>Hey, yo, Butch!</i>

01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:28.994
Gloria, go in the basement
and lock the door.

01:03:28.996 --> 01:03:30.695
<i>I'm not going
to tell you again.</i>

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:33.264
<i>William!</i>

01:03:33.266 --> 01:03:35.367
Don't go and do
something stupid.

01:03:35.369 --> 01:03:36.568
Please, Gloria, baby girl,
please.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:40.070
<i>You wouldn't want things
to get messy.</i>

01:03:42.242 --> 01:03:43.041
Now!

01:04:07.233 --> 01:04:08.800
Thank you.

01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:10.534
Over there. Keep down,
keep down.

01:04:27.521 --> 01:04:28.552
<i>Get down!
Get down!</i>

01:04:42.436 --> 01:04:44.401
By the back! By the back
of the door!

01:04:58.818 --> 01:05:00.684
<i>Get out!
Get out!</i>

01:05:02.355 --> 01:05:06.324
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

01:05:06.326 --> 01:05:08.159
You motherfucker!

01:05:09.628 --> 01:05:12.296
<i>You're fucking crazy!</i>

01:05:12.298 --> 01:05:15.503
Who is she to you, huh?

01:05:16.635 --> 01:05:18.603
Now shit's going to get
fucking real!

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.717
I'm going to take good care
of your little girl, Butch!

01:05:33.719 --> 01:05:36.153
No one goes
in the basement! Nobody!

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:28.206
Hey, yo, Butch!
Found your piggy bank!

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:31.476
Maybe I give Gloria
her allowance.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:52.764
Boo.

01:07:56.362 --> 01:07:57.595
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:43.042 --> 01:08:44.675
<i>Little girl!</i>

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:40.598
What the fuck, Reggie?
A warning, something.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.767
<i>You scared the shit
out of me. What the fuck</i>

01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:43.968
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.535
Fuck.

01:09:45.537 --> 01:09:48.106
Find the rest.

01:09:48.108 --> 01:09:49.107
<i>Fucking dick.</i>

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:50.741
The kid's mine.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.363
<i>Jackie!</i>

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:12.032
Where you at, babe?

01:10:20.672 --> 01:10:22.440
Come on, Jacks.

01:10:36.655 --> 01:10:39.757
You lying sack of shit!

01:10:39.759 --> 01:10:43.193
Easy, easy! Look, I didn't want
it to turn out this way.

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:44.695
Fuck you!

01:10:44.697 --> 01:10:46.030
It's just business.

01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:47.665
Yeah, then finish the job.

01:10:56.576 --> 01:10:58.742
Fuck, T-Dogg!
What the fuck?

01:11:01.814 --> 01:11:03.781
<i>Jackie, what the fuck
is this?</i>

01:11:03.783 --> 01:11:05.616
You should be dead,
motherfucker! Jackie!

01:11:14.194 --> 01:11:15.092
What the fuck?

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:32.643
Little girl.

01:11:44.524 --> 01:11:45.755
Gloria!

01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:49.727
T-Dogg! Where the fuck
you at?

01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:58.736
<i>T-Dogg!</i>

01:12:01.207 --> 01:12:02.072
Hey, Jackie!

01:13:28.795 --> 01:13:32.862
Baby girl, sweetie, honey!

01:13:32.864 --> 01:13:36.299
Come talk to your daddy's
friend.

01:14:02.929 --> 01:14:04.695
Come on!

01:14:33.025 --> 01:14:33.790
Oh!

01:14:34.359 --> 01:14:34.858
Gloria!

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:35.358
<i>Dad!</i>

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.160
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:38.161
<i>Dad!</i>

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:38.862
Dad!

01:14:39.931 --> 01:14:42.098
<i>Oh, hey there, Butch.</i>

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:42.833
Please.

01:14:42.835 --> 01:14:43.733
Really?

01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:44.768
Let her go!

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.004
No.

01:14:46.006 --> 01:14:49.373
<i>All you had to do
was give us the bitch.</i>

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:51.776
But you had to go
and be a fucking hero.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:56.714
So now, hero, put down
the fucking gun,

01:14:56.716 --> 01:14:59.349
or I shoot her in
the fucking head.

01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:02.887
Okay. Okay.

01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:03.888
Put down the gun.

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:04.888
Okay.

01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:08.425
<i>Get on your knees.</i>

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:10.894
<i>Get on your
fucking knees!</i>

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:15.433
Good boy.

01:15:17.002 --> 01:15:19.303
<i>Hey, yo, Carter.
We're down here.</i>

01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:23.473
Yo!

01:15:25.744 --> 01:15:26.376
Ah, fuck it.

01:15:27.012 --> 01:15:27.745
Oh!

01:15:27.747 --> 01:15:31.415
Daddy! No, no!

01:15:32.185 --> 01:15:34.184
Dad! No!

01:15:37.789 --> 01:15:40.290
Look at me, Butch.

01:15:40.292 --> 01:15:40.692
Stop.

01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:41.826
Look at me.

01:15:41.828 --> 01:15:42.425
It's okay, baby.

01:15:42.427 --> 01:15:42.826
Please, please.

01:15:42.828 --> 01:15:43.861
Look at me.

01:15:45.765 --> 01:15:47.263
<i>No, no, no, no!
No, stop!</i>

01:15:54.273 --> 01:15:55.272
What?

01:16:00.412 --> 01:16:01.978
What the fuck?

01:16:56.868 --> 01:16:58.035
We've got to...

01:16:58.037 --> 01:16:59.102
Can I help?

01:17:01.807 --> 01:17:03.574
I don't know
what to do, Dad.

01:17:03.576 --> 01:17:08.044
It's okay, baby. It's okay,
baby. It's okay now.

01:17:08.046 --> 01:17:12.249
No, no. Jackie!

01:17:12.251 --> 01:17:12.816
It's okay, Gloria.

01:17:12.818 --> 01:17:14.285
No, no, I can fix you.

01:17:14.287 --> 01:17:14.885
Gloria.

01:17:14.887 --> 01:17:16.586
I can fix you.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.555
I can fix you, I can.

01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:20.825
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

01:17:20.827 --> 01:17:23.027
No, no, no. I can do it.
I can do it.

01:17:24.063 --> 01:17:26.597
Please, God.
God, please.

01:17:26.599 --> 01:17:28.199
Daddy, Daddy.

01:17:28.201 --> 01:17:28.599
Baby.

01:17:28.601 --> 01:17:29.599
Daddy, I...

01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:32.836
It's okay, baby.
You're safe now.

01:17:32.838 --> 01:17:33.537
Shh.

01:17:33.539 --> 01:17:35.406
But you've got to get up, Dad.

01:17:35.408 --> 01:17:37.540
You've really got to get up,
please.

01:17:39.345 --> 01:17:42.446
No, come on, Daddy! Please!

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:47.250
Come on! You can't leave!
You can't leave me, please!

01:17:59.364 --> 01:18:04.468
I promise I can fix you.
Please, just...

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:09.373
Everything. Everything that's
ever been good about me

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:12.643
is right here.

01:18:12.645 --> 01:18:17.580
It's right here.
And it always will be.

01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:23.653
So, you see, I could never
leave you.

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:28.525
I could never leave you.

01:18:28.527 --> 01:18:29.626
Come on.

01:18:34.567 --> 01:18:36.634
To sunrises.

01:18:38.604 --> 01:18:41.638
Mm-hmm.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.206
And sunsets.

01:18:48.546 --> 01:18:55.318
I love you, Dad.
No, no.

01:18:55.988 --> 01:18:58.923
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

01:19:07.065 --> 01:19:08.531
No!

01:19:14.606 --> 01:19:15.975
No!

01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.642
No!

01:19:18.644 --> 01:19:21.111
No! No!

01:19:21.113 --> 01:19:26.951
Please.

01:21:12.323 --> 01:21:13.656
Bye.

01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:37.548
<i>I think people do
bad things for good reasons.</i>

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:43.653
<i>My dad was a good man...
did bad things,</i>

01:21:43.655 --> 01:21:45.722
<i>but he did them for me.</i>

01:21:47.493 --> 01:21:49.826
<i>Good bye, Daddy.</i>
