00:02.760 --> 00:04.671
<i>Kylie wanted to take things slowly.</i>

00:04.760 --> 00:09.276
<i>So, 17 dates in, I was embroiled in</i>
<i>the world's longest make-out session.</i>

00:09.360 --> 00:10.634
- Too much kissing?
- No.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.995
Come on,
I still have a little saliva left.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.834
<i>As I felt the onslaught</i>
<i>of a vicious tongue cramp,</i>

00:16.920 --> 00:20.037
<i>I decided it was time to let</i>
<i>Kylie see my favourite dance.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:22.839
<i>The "for God's sake,</i>
<i>invite me to stay over" dance.</i>

00:22.920 --> 00:24.831
<i>We all know where that ends.</i>

00:29.640 --> 00:32.200
<i>The dance begins with a subtle hint.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.631
I am so pooped.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.836
<i>Step two, sashay her into sympathy.</i>

00:36.920 --> 00:40.390
- It's chilly out there.
- It is cold.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.472
<i>Finally, sweep her off her feet</i>
<i>with vulnerable cuteness.</i>

00:43.560 --> 00:47.189
You know what I call this weather?
Snuggle weather.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.831
<i>Tip the band leader and fluff up the</i>
<i>pillows, because this dance is done.</i>

00:51.920 --> 00:53.797
You should go.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.838
Yeah, hit the bricks, bitch.
You got no game.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.634
<i>I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>with relationship trouble.</i>

01:02.720 --> 01:05.029
<i>Lately, Turk and Carla</i>
<i>had lost their sizzle.</i>

01:05.120 --> 01:08.556
<i>As a couple, when you reach a roadblock,</i>
<i>you can do one of two things:</i>

01:08.640 --> 01:12.519
<i>Look inward, try and solve your problems</i>
<i>together or blame someone else.</i>

01:12.600 --> 01:16.195
- You have to move out.
- What? Is this about the bra catapult?

01:16.280 --> 01:18.919
If it's a big deal,
I can throw my own water balloons.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.594
- I don't need those C-cups.
- We're newlyweds.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.513
That's hard enough
and when you're around...

01:24.600 --> 01:26.477
Tell him, Turk.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.437
You're all up in our space!

01:28.520 --> 01:32.433
What? When have I ever
been all up in your space?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.515
This is nice.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.315
Sorry about the twosie, guys.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.038
And here I thought that
was a lovely evening.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.476
We're all adults here,
so I guess I'll just bid you guys adieu

01:51.560 --> 01:54.711
and gather my things quietly,
starting with my cable box.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.200 --> 02:23.428
Guys, guys, guys.

02:23.520 --> 02:27.274
You've been working here two years.
Why am I teaching you the same stuff?

02:27.360 --> 02:30.830
I want to see you apply
light pressure in small circles.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.433
Can we take a break?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.080
The sun is scorching,
and I'm very fair-skinned.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.720
You've only been out here
for eight minutes.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.950
Whatever.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.996
The intern car wash.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.470
You saving up so you can finally
get those pec implants replaced?

02:45.560 --> 02:47.869
Ron is coming to town today.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.839
Speaking of which, I need to see you
put on something a bit nicer.

02:51.920 --> 02:56.152
You know, this whole competition thing
you have with your high school buddy,

02:56.240 --> 02:58.117
it is very, very boring.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.589
You were homecoming king,
he was prom king.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.398
You went to medical school,
he went to business school.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.198
You got divorced, he got divorced.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.874
Yeah, but he never has
to see his wife anymore,

03:06.960 --> 03:09.076
so he's got me beat on that one.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.631
Look, I am not going to let this weekend
become about who's a bigger man.

03:13.720 --> 03:17.110
Ron's bringing his kid.
I can't wait to meet the child.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.395
When he comes here
in his crappy rent-a-car

03:19.480 --> 03:21.835
and gets a look
at my hand-polished Porsche,

03:21.920 --> 03:25.913
- naturally, I'll have the lead.
- Very exciting.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.351
Hey. Hey, guys.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.797
I know the chopper seems a bit much,
but there was crazy traffic,

03:44.880 --> 03:47.917
so I had my assistant
drive my rental car from the airport.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.038
Well, it hardly seems worth it now,
but what the hell?

03:53.120 --> 03:56.829
So, Per, what are you
driving these days?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.438
- Well, that old girl needs a wash.
- Thank you, Ron.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.515
I can't believe they are kicking me out.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.875
At 15, my parents
threatened the same thing.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.951
- I called them on it.
- They let you stay?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.429
Nope. I lived with
the Babcock's for two years.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.228
I didn't have any rules because they
were old and thought I was a ghost.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.709
<i>All right, Carla calls the shots.</i>
<i>Appeal to her rational side.</i>

04:21.800 --> 04:24.519
Carla, I understand
you guys need space,

04:24.600 --> 04:27.034
but with work
and my financial situation,

04:27.120 --> 04:30.157
finding a new place is going
to be minimum, two to four years.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.470
Come on.
Aren't there other married couples

04:32.560 --> 04:35.154
who want to live with a 29-year-old man?

04:35.240 --> 04:38.312
<i>She called me a man.</i>
<i>OK, time to play the best-friend card.</i>

04:38.400 --> 04:40.789
I've always had your back,
you always had mine.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.871
- You want to do this?
- It was my idea.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.997
- I banged your first girlfriend.
- Chantal?

04:46.080 --> 04:49.550
Now, look, I need a favour.
Let me try it, I'll move out for a week.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.870
If you still like it,
I'll move out for good.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.358
- Agreed.
- All right.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.035
And don't worry about John Dorian
because I may be poor in pocket,

04:58.120 --> 04:59.473
but I'm rich in friends.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.630
I need to crash
at your place for a week.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.073
- Nope.
- <i>That's OK.</i>

05:03.160 --> 05:05.799
<i>When God closes a window,</i>
<i>he opens a door.</i>

05:08.920 --> 05:11.593
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with you sleeping here.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.071
Kylie, I hear you. But trust me,
this week is not going to be about sex.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.472
Though I think that's where we'd
like our relationship to end up, right?

05:20.560 --> 05:22.152
So, what do you say?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.792
It's good to see you, buddy.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.440
It is great to see you,
I'll tell you that.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.318
Looks like we're in a
walk and hug here. What say we?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.958
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.996
So look at you, Mr Big Time Doctor.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.116
How about you, Mr Big Time...

05:40.200 --> 05:43.272
- I don't actually know what you do.
- I've told you 100 times.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.399
I run mergers and acquisitions
for a large private equity hedge fund.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.198
- You've forgotten already.
- No.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.316
You do hedge clippings for a big farm.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.949
You privately acquire hedgehogs.
You got a hog farm. Give me a break.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.032
Tell me this, how's that
super sexy mother of yours?

05:58.120 --> 06:01.590
Your crush on my mom was cute when
we were 14, but the woman's 85 now.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.910
You need to back off
or ask her out to dinner.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.039
I'll have her pop in her "going out"
teeth, you can see if there's a spark.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.031
- Jordan.
- Hi.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.315
- Will you be joining us for dinner?
- No way.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.358
When we go out, the whole night
is a giant pissing contest.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.670
No, it doesn't.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.356
First one who tags the dog wins.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.353
Count it.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.555
I've seen that dog
around the neighbourhood.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.710
- I think we killed its spirit.
- Yeah.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.439
Bring Nathan over tonight.
The kids can play.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.909
We can forget all
about this competition crap.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.551
- I'd like that.
- So would I.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.995
Jack is going to kick
Nathan's ass at playing.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.196
<i>Crazy.</i>

06:47.320 --> 06:50.949
How great is it
not having J.D. Around, huh?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.998
So great. So great.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.470
- Now what?
- Well, let's see.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.635
Did it on the couch.
Did it in the kitchen.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.109
- Oh, yes. We did.
- Want to do it on J.D.'s bed?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.191
I think it's about time someone did.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.515
Do you really want
to have more sex?

07:10.600 --> 07:13.239
No, I didn't even want
to do it in the kitchen.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.313
Well, what do we do now?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.798
When J.D. And I are bored,
we play "toe or finger".

07:21.640 --> 07:24.996
Close your eyes. I run either
a toe or finger underneath your nose

07:25.080 --> 07:27.230
and you try to guess
which one it is, huh?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.071
Fine. What do you want to do?

07:30.160 --> 07:33.835
Usually when J.D. Gets off work,
we gossip about hospital stuff.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.229
- Baby, that sounds a little immature.
- OK!

07:36.320 --> 07:38.629
Then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.118
Hi, guys. Thanks for inviting me over.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.238
Thanks for letting us crash here.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.153
Todd's not accustomed
to receiving gentleman callers.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.432
OK. Oh, cool picture.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.033
Which one of those guys is you?

07:57.120 --> 07:58.712
Oh, I don't swim.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.236
So there's only one rule if you're
going to stay at El Casa de Todd.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.993
You got to hammock up.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.511
Oh, I don't have one of those, Todd.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.352
No problem.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.353
What are you, about a medium?

08:15.280 --> 08:17.748
- Extra-medium.
- This will work.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.195
And it'll look good too.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.430
All right, Jack, listen to me.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.479
Ron's in the bathroom diapering his kid.
When he gets out, it's playtime.

08:26.560 --> 08:31.111
And, son, lately your colouring's
been sloppy and your <i>Elmo Song,</i> well,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.077
unfortunately, it's lacked heart.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.071
Now you and I,
we both know that your

08:35.159 --> 08:37.799
super-secret, go-to toy
are your building blocks.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.350
Well, it's time to shine, Jackie Cox.
It is time to shine.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.671
Earn Daddy's love on three.
1, 2, 3, earn Daddy's love.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.236
- 27-second diaper change.
- I can change a diaper in 20 seconds.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.276
- Oh, my God.
- Say, Ronnie,

08:52.360 --> 08:55.397
what say we let the kids play
for a while?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.710
They could play with, oh, I don't know,

08:57.800 --> 09:01.349
how about the building blocks that
Jack very rarely ever even touches?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.671
You know, Nathan is actually
in the 90th percentile in height.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.639
Jack's only in the 85th. Of course,
he's in the 99th for head size.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.439
Congratulations.
Your son's the Hamburgler.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.034
Head size is directly
related to intelligence.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.599
Really?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.277
Jack, get the bucket off.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.714
And Laverne told me that Nurse Tisdale

09:25.800 --> 09:28.473
is sleeping with
that married albino radiologist.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.755
- Oh, I feel so bad for his wife.
- Elliot!

09:30.840 --> 09:34.719
It's not about empathy,
it's about judging people.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.360
Can't we do something else?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.311
I said I don't want to play that game.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.676
OK, I vote Elliot goes home
because she's all up in our space!

09:43.760 --> 09:45.079
She's in our space.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.118
Why? Because I won't dish
about others or smell your toe?

09:48.600 --> 09:49.669
Or finger.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.470
All I've seen so far is the toe, Turk!

09:54.080 --> 09:56.150
See you tomorrow, guys.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.516
Look, Perry, we just have
to accept Jack the way he is,

10:01.600 --> 10:06.230
love him unconditionally and enrol him
in some sort of block-building class.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.392
- Look at these things, Jordan.
- Yeah?

10:09.480 --> 10:12.756
The colour coordination,
the... the symmetry.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.149
A two-year-old
shouldn't be able to do this.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.958
What are you trying to say?

10:17.040 --> 10:20.396
<i>They say admitting there's</i>
<i>a problem is half the battle...</i>

10:20.920 --> 10:23.229
<i>... even if it's something</i>
<i>you didn't expect.</i>

10:23.320 --> 10:25.276
What is wrong with you guys?

10:25.360 --> 10:27.396
We miss J.D.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.559
<i>When warning signs are in front of you,</i>
<i>there's no denying the truth.</i>

10:34.640 --> 10:36.596
Nathan has classic signs of autism.

10:43.200 --> 10:48.035
Nathan doesn't make eye contact, barely
speaks, freaks out when you cuddle him.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.157
I mean, hell, if he was an adult,
he'd be, well...

10:51.240 --> 10:53.276
...you know, me.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.598
Those behaviours in a child
could point towards autism.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.194
- It's obvious what we have to do.
- Grit our teeth,

11:00.280 --> 11:02.510
get through the weekend,
never speak to Ron?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.158
Exactly.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.949
- I can't believe what I just heard!
- The ticking of your biological clock

11:08.040 --> 11:11.510
leading you towards the corner
of Celibate and Spinster Way?

11:11.600 --> 11:15.036
Sometimes it's great
to already have a bastard child.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.998
- You said it.
- You know, it is our obligation

11:18.080 --> 11:20.514
as doctors to tell someone
if there is a problem.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.319
And I will bring a child
into this world when I am ready,

11:23.400 --> 11:25.630
not when society dictates I must.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.112
Good God, you smell like baby.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.116
I've only actually
met the child once,

11:36.200 --> 11:40.113
so I think it's important we figure out
a way to spend some alone time with him.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.033
Perry, if I'm going
to be spending a lot of time

11:43.120 --> 11:44.633
with someone else's child,

11:44.720 --> 11:47.917
it's going to be with
our neighbour's 17-year-old.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.355
And don't think he hasn't asked.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.396
Oh. Pablo.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.312
Hello? Anybody home?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.833
J.D., we're right here.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.319
<i>You want to come back!</i>

12:01.400 --> 12:02.879
I came to get my toothbrush.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.872
Carla took it out the bathroom,
put it in the hall closet.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.873
Finger. Bingo.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.153
Come on, Rowdy.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.959
- We should ask him back.
- Baby, no.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.110
We're too proud.
We are the proud Turks.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.390
Hey, guys, the heater's broken again.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.869
- What happened?
- <i>I clubbed it with a Maglite.</i>

12:22.960 --> 12:26.270
I can probably stay and fix it.
It could take 3, 4, 5 days.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.272
I did a triple bypass yesterday.
I think I can fix it.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.555
Suit yourself.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.917
Bye, trumpet player I don't know.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.675
Now I understand
why your music is so sad.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.198
So I hear you're homeless.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.555
I want to volunteer,
give you a place to stay.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.473
- I don't think so, buddy.
- Listen, crash in my garage.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.916
I guarantee you there will
not be another person in there.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.352
You're going to slather jam on my face
and sic a family of raccoons on me.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.034
- Damn it. I've become predictable.
- I'm out.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.793
Oh, yeah? Well, from what
I hear I'm your last option.

13:09.880 --> 13:14.556
Options! I got cable TV and a dead dog.
I got plenty of options.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.359
Come on in.
I've got a huge king bed.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.352
It'll be nice to have a buffer
between me and my mom.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.836
Sorry, bro. We're crowded tonight.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.798
- Lonnie, you have three kids?
- That I know of.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.677
Yeah?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.680
- Does Doug Murphy live here?
- The pathologist?

13:38.760 --> 13:40.113
- Yeah.
- No. He moved out.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.158
Excuse me.
I have to go change somebody's life.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.996
But, Mr McMahon, would you mind?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.392
You are correct, sir!

13:51.720 --> 13:54.871
Why do you want to baby-sit my kid?
You think I can't handle him?

13:54.960 --> 13:58.032
No, not at all. You're great
with him, fantastic with him.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.714
In fact, if you want,
you can baby-sit my kid.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.268
We doing this?
I'll baby-sit the hell out of Jack.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.112
- Bring it on.
- Need a baby-sitter?

14:05.200 --> 14:07.634
You don't have to pay cash,
just hot showers.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.757
You don't have to wash me,
unless you want, but that's weird.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.992
- Newbie, I've got this one covered.
- You two are interracial best buddies.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.991
I, too, have a black best friend.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.390
Go out. Enjoy it.
Celebrate your uniqueness. I can do it!

14:20.480 --> 14:22.994
I'm sorry. Did you just call me black?

14:23.080 --> 14:27.312
Because the last time I checked, the
correct term was "African-American".

14:27.400 --> 14:29.630
Well, Turk lets me call him brown bear.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.154
- Who the hell is Turk?
- I should go.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.630
Angry black man. It never disappoints.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.837
- I pull it out when I need to.
- Well, what do you say?

14:41.920 --> 14:45.037
Well, I do have a lot
of work to get done.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.634
- You can watch Nate.
- You got it.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.110
<i>Sometimes the worst thing</i>
<i>is getting exactly what you want.</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:54.954
Nathan? Look at me.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.359
Nathan.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.837
Damn it.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.159
Baby?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.629
Could you get a towel
to wipe sweat from my head?

15:09.720 --> 15:12.439
They're all dirty, OK?
J.D. Used to wash them.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.515
It's so hot!

15:15.600 --> 15:17.750
When is he going
to finish with the heater?

15:17.840 --> 15:20.559
It's OK. He's a professional,
he's almost done.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.156
This should not have been removed.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.677
Todd made you wear
a hammock to bed?

15:30.760 --> 15:33.832
It was horrible. I kept imagining
I was an Olympic diver.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.758
It means a lot to me
that you would go through all that

15:37.840 --> 15:39.273
to respect my boundaries.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.397
Thanks, Kylie.
I can just sleep on the couch.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.755
You don't have to crash on the couch.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.068
Well, Dr Dorian,
are you going to join me?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.310
<i>I couldn't have planned it better.</i>

16:06.440 --> 16:08.954
J. D! We're sorry.
The door was unlocked,

16:09.040 --> 16:12.077
and we knew you'd be here.
We want you back.

16:12.160 --> 16:16.915
I don't want to come home. It took me
a month to get here from the couch.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.389
J.D., maybe you should go home.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.438
<i>Get the moment back! Say something hot!</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:26.798
Perhaps we could invite Turk
and Carla to join us on the bed.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.070
I'll go.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.920
It is so great you're going
to talk to your friend.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.833
It's going to be hard.
If you need me, just say the word.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.514
I will jump right in.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.595
- I need to talk to you about Nathan.
- That little guy's my life.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.398
I have to go.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.629
What's up?

16:51.720 --> 16:56.316
Ron, there is no easy way to do this,
so I'm going to go ahead and say it.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.231
I think Nathan is autistic.

17:00.280 --> 17:04.796
That's the real reason that
I wanted to spend time with him today.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.159
This is... this is unbelievable.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.595
I know. The good news
is that we found out early.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.829
- So you can be as proactive as you...
- No.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.832
You are unbelievable. I mean...

17:17.920 --> 17:21.151
You can't handle that my kid
is better at building blocks,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.550
so you tell me there's
something wrong with him?

17:25.079 --> 17:29.949
You know what, why don't you
just get the hell out of here?

17:31.120 --> 17:34.032
That's just not going to happen.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.758
No way.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.637
<i>At first I was disappointed</i>
<i>I wasn't sleeping at Kylie's,</i>

17:43.720 --> 17:45.153
<i>but it was good to be home.</i>

17:45.240 --> 17:47.470
I'm home! Hello, fridge.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.278
Good to see you, lamp.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.237
Here I come, couch!

17:54.000 --> 17:56.036
You guys moved couch?

17:56.920 --> 18:00.435
<i>It's always nice to let your friends</i>
<i>know that you appreciate them...</i>

18:00.520 --> 18:02.511
I'm glad you're home, buddy.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.151
I missed you,
my African-American friend.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.993
- Call me brown bear.
- Brown bear.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.114
This... is a classmate
of mine from medical school.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.555
He's located up in your area now.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.071
I think he'd really help you.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.789
<i>But sometimes you can't quite find</i>
<i>words to show that appreciation.</i>

18:29.560 --> 18:31.039
You know...

18:31.120 --> 18:33.076
I just want to say that

18:33.160 --> 18:36.630
I'm going to handle this situation
so much better than you could.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.395
Oh, give me a break. I would
kick your ass in situation-handling.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.358
I'm a doctor, for God sakes.
And for the record,

18:43.440 --> 18:46.910
the Vegas odds-makers
are making Coxy a heavy favourite.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.560
Well, then, I would just
bet on me and make a bundle.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.517
You know what?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.238
I probably would too.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.876
Behold, the Twinkie
from the first day we moved in.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.871
I owe you an apology, Turk.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.837
- Splitsies?
- Of course.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.319
- Want some?
- No.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.799
OK, fine. More for me.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.839
So, Bambi, what's the deal
with all the things you do around here?

19:12.920 --> 19:14.797
What do you mean?

19:14.880 --> 19:17.519
The laundry, the fixing the radiator,

19:17.600 --> 19:20.751
listening to me gossip
and playing stupid games with Turk.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.990
How do you make yourself
do all that stuff?

19:23.080 --> 19:26.197
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>the best thing to do is to be honest.</i>

19:26.280 --> 19:28.350
I don't know. I never thought about it.

19:28.440 --> 19:32.752
I guess when you care about someone,
you do what you can to make them happy.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.473
You know, it's funny.

19:36.560 --> 19:41.156
You guys couldn't go one week alone
without needing J. Dizzle around.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.559
What is up with that?

19:42.640 --> 19:45.234
<i>You have to hope honesty</i>
<i>doesn't make them realize</i>

19:45.320 --> 19:47.197
<i>what they didn't want to know.</i>

19:48.280 --> 19:50.669
We're in trouble, aren't we?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.919
Yeah.
