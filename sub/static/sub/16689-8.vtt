WEBVTT

00:00.808 --> 00:02.977
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...

00:03.898 --> 00:06.835
GORDON JOURNEYS
TO POMONA, CALIFORNIA,

00:06.868 --> 00:09.104
AND FINDS A FINE DINING
RESTAURANT

00:09.137 --> 00:11.039
THAT IS ANYTHING
BUT FINE DINING.

00:11.072 --> 00:12.907
I THINK WE'VE HIT
ROCK BOTTOM.

00:12.941 --> 00:14.776
THE CHEF IS FRESH
FROM THE HOOD.

00:14.809 --> 00:16.344
* DIAMONDS ON MY FISH,
LOOK, DIAMONDS ON MY FISH *

00:16.378 --> 00:17.912
I'M HOT.

00:17.946 --> 00:19.914
AND DOESN'T TAKE
CRITICISM FROM ANYBODY.

00:19.948 --> 00:22.017
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT  ALREADY.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.818
NOT EVEN GORDON.
I DIDN'T HEAR NOT ONE PERSON
COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TONIGHT.

00:23.852 --> 00:25.120
DID YOU?
WHAT?!

00:25.153 --> 00:26.454
THE OWNER HAS RUN OUT
OF MONEY.

00:26.488 --> 00:28.189
I'M JUST SURVIVING.

00:28.223 --> 00:29.991
THE RESTAURANT HAS RUN
OUT OF FOOD.

00:30.025 --> 00:31.726
WE DON'T HAVE
THE SALMON TODAY.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.661
NO SEA BASS.
WE DON'T HAVE THE KEY LIME.

00:33.695 --> 00:35.764
THE HEAD WAITRESS
AND THE CHEF ARE AT WAR.

00:35.797 --> 00:37.332
YOU PISS ME OFF

00:37.365 --> 00:39.100
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
RUN THIS!

00:39.134 --> 00:40.535
DON'T BLAME THAT
ON US.

00:40.568 --> 00:42.504
AND THE PREP COOK HAS
STICKY FINGERS.

00:42.537 --> 00:44.205
DID YOU ASK ANYONE FOR IT?
NO.

00:44.239 --> 00:46.141
SO MANY PROBLEMS...

00:46.174 --> 00:47.776
I NEED THE TICKET.
I DON'T SEE THE TICKET.

00:47.809 --> 00:49.811
SO FEW DAYS.
SERVICE, PLEASE.

00:49.844 --> 00:52.080
THIS COULD BE GORDON'S
BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET.

00:52.113 --> 00:53.915
I'M ABOUT TO WALK RIGHT NOW.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.183
TONIGHT...
BRING IT.

00:55.216 --> 00:56.584
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

00:56.618 --> 00:58.720
YOU ARE NOT AN EXECUTIVE CHEF.
LET'S GET THAT RIGHT.

01:01.823 --> 01:09.764
*

01:18.773 --> 01:21.776
POMONA, CALIFORNIA.

01:21.810 --> 01:25.213
A SMALL MIDDLE CLASS TOWN
POPULATED BY ASPIRING ARTISTS,

01:25.246 --> 01:28.216
COLLEGE STUDENTS,
AND CAR ENTHUSIASTS.

01:28.249 --> 01:30.000
IT'S HOME
TO LELA'S RESTAURANT,

01:30.000 --> 01:30.051
IT'S HOME
TO LELA'S RESTAURANT,

01:30.085 --> 01:32.387
A FINE DINING RESTAURANT
ONLY EIGHT MONTHS OLD.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.256
YET IT'S DAYS AWAY
FROM CLOSING ITS DOORS.

01:35.290 --> 01:36.524
HELLO!

01:36.558 --> 01:39.527
I'M THE OWNER OF
A FINE DINING RESTAURANT.

01:43.098 --> 01:45.834
LELA'S SHOULDN'T BE IN
THE DOWNTOWN POMONA CENTER.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.669
THERE'S A LOT
OF HOMELESS PEOPLE.

01:47.702 --> 01:50.004
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
LELA'S FITS POMONA.

01:50.038 --> 01:51.973
OUR RESTAURANT HERE
IS CRAZY.

01:52.006 --> 01:54.909
RICKY, HE'S ALWAYS LOUD.

01:54.943 --> 01:57.312
OKAY, ALL RIGHT!
LET'S GO, HEY!

01:57.345 --> 01:58.580
I'M HOT.

01:58.613 --> 02:00.000
THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.348
THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.183
LIKE YOU WALK
INTO A CLUB, YOU KNOW,

02:02.217 --> 02:04.319
AND YOU JUST WALK ON THE DANCE
FLOOR AND JUST BE LIKE--

02:04.352 --> 02:06.121
SINCE IT'S MY KITCHEN,
MY MENU,

02:06.154 --> 02:07.622
YOU KNOW, I CAN DO THAT.

02:07.655 --> 02:09.624
I HAVE A KNIFE, BRIAN.
GET AWAY FROM ME.

02:09.657 --> 02:11.659
WE CLOWN EACH OTHER.
WE HAVE FUN WHILE WE'RE IN HERE.

02:11.693 --> 02:14.262
WHAT THE HELL IS
IN YOUR EAR, MAN?

02:14.295 --> 02:15.630
THIS IS 14-KARAT GOLD, BABY.

02:15.663 --> 02:17.499
I MEAN, THIS IS
THE REAL DEAL.

02:17.532 --> 02:19.634
BUZZARD LIKES TO STAY
IN THE KITCHEN AND EAT.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.369
LIKES TO PECK AT THE FOOD
ALL THE TIME.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.872
BUZZARD--
YOU CAN DO IT, BUZZARD!

02:26.074 --> 02:27.809
YOU KNOW, WE'RE LIKE
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

02:27.842 --> 02:29.611
HEY, I NEED
MY  ORDER NOW.

02:29.644 --> 02:30.000
ALL WE DO IS READ THE TICKET
TO PUT THE FOOD OUT.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.113
ALL WE DO IS READ THE TICKET
TO PUT THE FOOD OUT.

02:32.147 --> 02:33.414
TABITHA, MAN.

02:33.448 --> 02:35.116
I JUST HAVE TO TELL HER
TO CHILL OUT.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.351
AND I YELL RIGHT BACK
AT HER ASS.

02:36.384 --> 02:37.552
I'M THE ONE HAVING
TO TAKE THIS GUY'S ORDER,

02:37.585 --> 02:39.120
AND TELLING HIM,

02:39.154 --> 02:41.022
"OH, WE DON'T HAVE THIS
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT."

02:41.055 --> 02:42.857
DON'T BLAME
THAT  ON US,

02:42.891 --> 02:44.159
'CAUSE IT AIN'T OUR FAULT.

02:44.192 --> 02:45.627
RICKY, I CAN'T STAND HIM.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.795
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T  KNOW
HOW TO DO?

02:47.829 --> 02:48.830
THAT'S WHY THIS RESTAURANT
IS RUN THE WAY IT IS.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.098
THE PROBLEM WITH TABITHA

02:50.131 --> 02:51.766
IS HOW SHE TALKS TO PEOPLE.

02:51.799 --> 02:53.868
ORDERS THAT.

02:53.902 --> 02:55.570
MAN, SHUT UP ALREADY.

02:55.603 --> 02:57.705
EVERYBODY CAN HEAR
RICKY AND TABITHA YELLING

02:57.739 --> 02:58.973
WHEN THEY YELL AT EACH OTHER.

03:00.475 --> 03:02.243
WE DON'T GOT  NOW!

03:02.277 --> 03:03.978
I THINK THEY'RE
OVERWHELMED IN HERE TODAY.

03:04.012 --> 03:06.247
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.

03:06.281 --> 03:07.715
BECAUSE YOUR GUESTS
ARE LIKE,

03:07.749 --> 03:09.384
"WHAT IS GOING ON BACK THERE?

03:09.417 --> 03:11.085
LIKE, I JUST WANTED A SALAD."

03:11.119 --> 03:13.054
LIKE, IT WAS SLOW.

03:13.087 --> 03:16.891
AND THEN JUST GETTING
SLOWER AND SLOWER AND SLOWER.

03:16.925 --> 03:18.860
I'M DEFINITELY LOSING MONEY
RIGHT NOW.

03:18.893 --> 03:21.462
I TOOK
ALL MY RETIREMENT MONEY,

03:21.496 --> 03:23.164
EVERYTHING I HAD SAVED,
EVERYTHING

03:23.198 --> 03:24.465
AND DECIDED TO OPEN
THIS RESTAURANT.

03:24.499 --> 03:26.000
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

03:26.034 --> 03:28.036
I THINK WE'VE HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

03:28.069 --> 03:30.000
I MEAN, WE'RE LIKE REALLY
GOING DOWN, DOWNHILL.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.038
I MEAN, WE'RE LIKE REALLY
GOING DOWN, DOWNHILL.

03:30.071 --> 03:31.773
I JUST WANTED TO SEE

03:31.806 --> 03:33.641
IF YOU HAVE SOME MONEY
TO LEND ME FOR THE RENT.

03:33.675 --> 03:35.376
OH, JEEZ.

03:35.410 --> 03:38.446
I OWE MY SISTER $60, 000.

03:38.479 --> 03:41.049
HOW MUCH?
$3, 700.

03:41.082 --> 03:43.952
I OWE $64, 000
FOR THE LINE OF CREDIT.

03:43.985 --> 03:46.521
I'M STRESSING.

03:46.554 --> 03:48.723
LIKE, HOW I'M GONNA
PAY MY BILLS AND MY RENT.

03:48.756 --> 03:50.925
AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.460
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE HER,

03:52.493 --> 03:53.328
BUT I HAVE BILLS
I HAVE TO PAY.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.964
CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT

03:55.997 --> 03:57.398
ONLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING
THROUGH MY MIND,

03:57.432 --> 03:58.833
"HOW CAN I FIX IT?"

03:58.866 --> 04:00.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.868
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

04:05.039 --> 04:07.308
SO WE'RE IN DOWNTOWN POMONA.

04:07.342 --> 04:10.545
UH, IT'S QUIET.
LIKE A GHOST TOWN AROUND HERE.

04:10.578 --> 04:12.413
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
FINE DINING,

04:12.447 --> 04:14.115
BUT IT'S VERY, VERY QUIET.

04:14.148 --> 04:16.651
AND THE PLACE LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY DERELICT INSIDE.

04:16.684 --> 04:17.852
MY GOD.

04:17.885 --> 04:19.220
I'M EXCITED.
I WANT TO HEAR HIS ACCENT.

04:21.189 --> 04:23.625
OH, LOOK AT THIS,
LOOK AT THIS, LOOK A THIS!

04:23.658 --> 04:26.628
LELA, NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:26.661 --> 04:27.962
HELLO.

04:27.996 --> 04:30.000
MY NAME'S TABITHA,
AND I'M YOUR SERVER.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.198
MY NAME'S TABITHA,
AND I'M YOUR SERVER.

04:30.231 --> 04:32.467
ALL I KNOW ABOUT CHEF RAMSAY
IS HE LIKES TO YELL A LOT.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.202
I DON'T TAKE ANYBODY
YELLING AT ME.

04:34.235 --> 04:35.603
NOBODY.

04:35.637 --> 04:37.372
AND THE SOUP TODAY
IS WHAT, PLEASE?
TOMATO BASIL.

04:37.405 --> 04:39.007
TOMATO BASIL.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.275
YES.
LOVELY, THANK YOU.

04:40.308 --> 04:42.677
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:42.710 --> 04:46.614
MENU, SPELLED INCORRECTLY
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

04:46.648 --> 04:48.316
WERE YOU READY

04:48.349 --> 04:49.250
WHAT IS THAT THERE?
CHIVAS?

04:49.284 --> 04:51.019

04:51.052 --> 04:52.987

CHIVAS.

04:53.021 --> 04:54.689
CHIVES.
OH, CHIVES.

04:54.722 --> 04:56.257
CAN'T EVEN SPELL CHIVE
PROPERLY.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.760
OKAY, CHIVES.

04:58.793 --> 05:00.000
LET'S GO WITH A SMALL BOWL
OF THE TOMATO BASIL.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.297
LET'S GO WITH A SMALL BOWL
OF THE TOMATO BASIL.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.666
OKAY.
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE NACHOS.

05:04.699 --> 05:06.734
WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE
THE SHRIMP NACHOS TODAY.

05:06.768 --> 05:08.269
WE HAVE A CHICKEN NACHO.

05:08.303 --> 05:10.638
SO NO SHRIMPS TODAY?
NO SHRIMPS.

05:10.672 --> 05:13.408
SO NO SHRIMP COCKTAIL
EITHER?

05:13.441 --> 05:16.611
OKAY, UM, I'D LIKE A SIDE
OF THE SALMON.

05:16.644 --> 05:18.546
WE DON'T HAVE
THE SALMON TODAY.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.281
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SALMON EITHER?
NO.

05:20.315 --> 05:21.683
YOU WOULD HAVE
TUNA, NO?

05:21.716 --> 05:23.951
I'M NOT SURE.
NO?

05:23.985 --> 05:25.520
OKAY.

05:25.553 --> 05:27.355
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.
AND IT'S REALLY JUST--

05:27.388 --> 05:28.756
IT'S IRRITATING
THE  OUT OF ME,

05:28.790 --> 05:30.000
BECAUSE I HATE
TO TELL CUSTOMERS

05:30.000 --> 05:30.058
BECAUSE I HATE
TO TELL CUSTOMERS

05:30.091 --> 05:31.426
THAT WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING.

05:31.459 --> 05:33.661
I'LL GO FOR
THE SPECIALTY OF THE HOUSE.

05:33.695 --> 05:35.029
THE ROASTED RACK OF LAMB.

05:35.063 --> 05:36.331
THE RACK OF LAMB.

05:36.364 --> 05:38.499
IN A CHOCOLATE MINT SAUCE,
PLEASE.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.834
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

05:39.867 --> 05:41.436
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

05:41.469 --> 05:43.604
VERY DISAPPOINTING WHEN YOU
SIT AND START ORDERING

05:43.638 --> 05:44.906
AND THEN HALF THE FOOD
IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE MENU.

05:44.939 --> 05:46.908
OKAY, THIS IS
YOUR ORDER.

05:46.941 --> 05:50.044
BRING IT.

05:50.078 --> 05:52.280
HE WANTED THE SHRIMPS NACHOS.
WE DON'T HAVE SHRIMP.

05:52.313 --> 05:54.449
HE WANTED THE SHRIMP COCKTAIL.
WE DON'T HAVE SHRIMP.

05:54.482 --> 05:56.250
FOR US TO SIT THERE
AND HAVE TO TELL CUSTOMERS,

05:56.284 --> 05:58.186
"OH, WE DON'T HAVE THIS
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT,"

05:58.219 --> 05:59.821
IT GETS FRUSTRATING FOR ME,

05:59.854 --> 06:00.000
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE
EVERYTHING.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.055
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE
EVERYTHING.

06:06.294 --> 06:07.428
WOW.

06:07.462 --> 06:08.629
HERE YOU GO.
LOVELY.

06:08.663 --> 06:10.031
I'M NOT NERVOUS.

06:10.064 --> 06:11.499
WHAT DO I NEED
TO BE NERVOUS FOR?

06:11.532 --> 06:14.802
YOU KNOW, HE'S A MAN
JUST LIKE I AM.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.975
INTERESTING.

06:21.008 --> 06:23.010
HOW IS EVERYTHING?

06:23.044 --> 06:25.446
IT TASTES LIKE IT'S CANNED.
YEAH.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.548
SO IT SAYS HOMEMADE SOUP
ON THE MENU,

06:27.582 --> 06:29.717
AND IT'S BROUGHT IN.

06:29.751 --> 06:30.000
CAN'T THE CHEF MAKE
TOMATO SOUP?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.419
CAN'T THE CHEF MAKE
TOMATO SOUP?

06:31.452 --> 06:33.421
PROBABLY.

06:33.454 --> 06:35.223
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
FINE DINING.

06:35.256 --> 06:36.624
SO DID I.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.025
SO I'LL WAIT
FOR THE NEXT COURSE.

06:38.059 --> 06:39.494
OKAY.

06:39.527 --> 06:41.095
CHICKEN NACHOS.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.997
OOH!
THAT WAS QUICK, WOW.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.433
EXCELLENT.
ENJOY.

06:45.466 --> 06:47.135
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?!

06:47.168 --> 06:49.904
OUR EXECUTIVE CHEF RICKY.

06:49.937 --> 06:52.473
* LOOK AT THEM DIAMONDS

06:52.507 --> 06:54.809
* DIAMONDS ON MY FISH,

06:54.842 --> 06:56.978
* DIAMONDS ON MY FISH,
LOOK, DIAMONDS ON MY FISH *

06:57.011 --> 06:59.080
YOU HAVE AN EXECUTIVE CHEF
IN THE HOUSE?
YES.

06:59.113 --> 07:00.000
AND HE BUYS IN
PROCESSED FOOD?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.815
AND HE BUYS IN
PROCESSED FOOD?

07:00.848 --> 07:01.783
SAY WHAT?!

07:01.816 --> 07:02.950

I'M GOOD AT MY JOB.
I LOVE MY RECIPES.

07:10.591 --> 07:12.126
I LET MY WORK
SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

07:17.398 --> 07:19.400
FINE DINING NACHOS.

07:19.434 --> 07:20.768
SOMETHING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.

07:20.802 --> 07:22.503
HOW IS EVERYTHING?

07:22.537 --> 07:24.005
YEAH, REALLY WEIRD.

07:24.038 --> 07:26.641
ARE THEY FRESH NACHOS
OR ARE THEY BROUGHT IN?

07:26.674 --> 07:28.810
THE CHEF MAKES THEM
FRESH IN THE MORNING.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.000
NO, I DON'T THINK

07:30.000 --> 07:30.745
NO, I DON'T THINK

07:30.778 --> 07:32.814
THEY WERE MADE FRESH
THIS MORNING, MY DARLING.

07:32.847 --> 07:35.283
RICKY, WHEN DID YOU MAKE
THE TORTILLA CHIPS?

07:35.316 --> 07:38.352
UH, YESTERDAY.

07:38.386 --> 07:40.254
I'M ABOUT TO WALK HOME
RIGHT NOW.

07:40.288 --> 07:42.223
THE NACHOS, LIKE IT WAS
THE CHEAPEST THING

07:42.256 --> 07:43.558
HE'S EVER SEEN.

07:43.591 --> 07:45.326
WHAT THE
DO YOU DO WITH NACHOS?

07:45.359 --> 07:47.028
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM NACHOS.

07:47.061 --> 07:47.595
THAT'S WHY IT'S
AN APPETIZER, YOU KNOW?

07:47.628 --> 07:49.831
OH, GOD.

07:51.466 --> 07:53.501
THE RACK OF LAMB
WITH THE CHOCOLATE MINT SAUCE.

07:53.534 --> 07:57.338
THERE'S FRESH MINT.
CHOCOLATE SYRUP.

07:57.371 --> 07:59.073
I LIKE IT.

07:59.106 --> 08:00.000
I GOT TO BE
REALLY CREATIVE WITH IT.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.741
I GOT TO BE
REALLY CREATIVE WITH IT.

08:00.775 --> 08:02.677
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.745
GOD, IT'S SO QUICK.

08:06.781 --> 08:08.449
OKAY.

08:08.483 --> 08:11.719
WHERE'S THE LAMB?

08:11.752 --> 08:13.387
NO, NO, NOT THAT.

08:13.421 --> 08:15.857
WHERE'S THE LAMB?
UH...

08:18.092 --> 08:20.995
LOOK--MY KNIFE'S BIGGER
THAN MY LAMB.

08:23.898 --> 08:25.433
FOR WHAT WE ARE
ABOUT TO EAT,

08:25.466 --> 08:28.169
MAY THE LORD MAKE US
TRULY NOT VOMIT.

08:28.202 --> 08:30.000
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.004
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

08:30.037 --> 08:31.405
COULD YOU ASK THE CHEF

08:31.439 --> 08:33.574
IS THE LAMB FROZEN?
YES.

08:33.608 --> 08:35.409
OH, THE LAMB IS FROZEN.
YES.

08:35.443 --> 08:37.578
HE'S JUST TAKING BITES
OF STUFF.

08:37.612 --> 08:41.082
"IS THIS FROZEN?"
AND I'M LIKE..."YEAH."

08:41.115 --> 08:43.518
IS THERE ANY MAIN COURSE

08:43.551 --> 08:46.020
THAT'S ON THE FINE DINING
MENU THAT'S NOT FROZEN.

08:46.053 --> 08:48.422
SAD TO SAY, BUT NO.
EVERYTHING IS FROZEN.

08:48.456 --> 08:49.490
OKAY.

08:49.524 --> 08:50.858
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:50.892 --> 08:52.693
I'LL SKIP ANY FURTHER
FROZEN FOOD

08:52.727 --> 08:54.896
AND MAYBE HAVE A NICE
FRESH DESSERT, PLEASE.

08:54.929 --> 08:56.998
OKAY.
I'M HUNGRY.
I'M STARVING.

08:57.031 --> 08:59.667
I HAVE  EATEN
ANYTHING YET.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.000
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE SHOT
EVERYTHING DOWN PRETTY MUCH.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.236
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE SHOT
EVERYTHING DOWN PRETTY MUCH.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.272
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT'S
ONE PERSON'S OPINION, YOU KNOW?

09:04.305 --> 09:06.841
AND HE'S ENTITLED TO IT.
SO THAT'S THAT.

09:06.874 --> 09:08.509
AND WHAT WOULD YOU
RECOMMEND FOR DESSERT?

09:08.543 --> 09:09.677
THERE YOU GO.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.012
FOR THE DESSERT,

09:11.045 --> 09:12.580
I WOULD RECOMMEND
THE BROWNIE A LA MODE.

09:12.613 --> 09:15.716
BROWNIE... A LA MODE.
BROWNIE A LA MODE.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.885
HE WAS LIKE, "PUT YOUR HAND UP
AND SWEAR TO GOD

09:17.919 --> 09:19.687
THAT IT'S A BROWNIE THAT'S
MADE--HOMEMADE FROM HERE."

09:19.720 --> 09:21.389
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO WITH THE BROWNIE.

09:21.422 --> 09:22.757
OKAY.
WOW.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.725
WHAT A SHAME,
WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE

09:24.759 --> 09:26.260
AND YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT
COMING IN TO EAT SOMEWHERE,

09:26.294 --> 09:28.262
AND THEN HALF THE MENU
MISSING,

09:28.296 --> 09:29.797
90% OF IT'S FROZEN,

09:29.830 --> 09:30.000
AND CHOCOLATE MINT SAUCE
WITH BONES OF LAMB.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.367
AND CHOCOLATE MINT SAUCE
WITH BONES OF LAMB.

09:33.401 --> 09:35.703
THERE WAS A BIG ASS PAN
IN HERE

09:35.736 --> 09:37.471
FULL OF  BROWNIES.

09:37.505 --> 09:39.407
I GO IN THERE, AND THERE'S
NO MORE HOMEMADE BROWNIES.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.242
BUZZARD!

09:41.275 --> 09:42.910
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BROWNIES.

09:42.944 --> 09:43.778
I DIDN'T DO IT.

09:43.811 --> 09:46.113
DON'T ASK THE BUZZARD.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:46.147 --> 09:48.015
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

09:48.049 --> 09:50.117
TO THAT BIG THING OF BROWNIES
THAT WERE IN THERE?

09:50.151 --> 09:53.988
WHEN?
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.
WHY?

09:54.021 --> 09:55.990
THEY WERE JUST IN THERE
LIKE THREE DAYS AGO.

09:56.023 --> 09:58.125
IT IRRITATES THE LIVING
DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME.

09:58.159 --> 10:00.000
WE SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING
THAT IS ON OUR MENU

10:00.000 --> 10:01.162
WE SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING
THAT IS ON OUR MENU

10:01.195 --> 10:02.430
AT ALL TIMES, AND WE DON'T.

10:02.463 --> 10:04.498
I'M JUST--I'M GONNA QUIT.

10:04.532 --> 10:05.733
SERIOUSLY.

10:05.766 --> 10:07.535
DON'T EVEN TALK
LIKE THAT, MAN.

10:07.568 --> 10:09.170
YOU GONNA LET ONE
PISS YOU OFF LIKE THAT?

10:09.203 --> 10:10.738
NO, YOU PISS ME OFF,

10:10.771 --> 10:12.406
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
RUN THIS , MAN!

10:12.440 --> 10:14.442
WE SHOULD HAVE
ALL THIS!

10:14.475 --> 10:16.510
WHAT THE
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:16.544 --> 10:18.145
YOU COMING BACK HERE
ASKING ME,

10:18.179 --> 10:19.580
"WHAT'S IN THIS?
WHAT'S IN THAT?"

10:19.614 --> 10:21.148
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT  ALREADY.

10:26.954 --> 10:28.222
YOU SHUT THE  UP!

10:28.255 --> 10:29.757
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:31.359 --> 10:34.328
COMING UP, BUZZARD CONFUSES
FINE DINING...

10:34.362 --> 10:36.631
DID YOU ASK ANYONE FOR IT?
NO.

10:36.664 --> 10:38.165
FOR TAKE OUT.

10:38.199 --> 10:39.800
THIS IS BUZZARD'S
LITTLE PICNIC.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.736
AND WHEN GORDON STEPS
INTO RICKY'S SPACE...

10:41.769 --> 10:43.170
I JUST TASTED THIS.

10:43.204 --> 10:44.138
IT TASTES LIKE
POWDERED MASHED POTATOES.

10:44.171 --> 10:45.606
THEY ARE.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.341
RICKY GOES ON THE ATTACK.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.909
I DIDN'T HEAR NOT ONE PERSON
COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TONIGHT.

10:48.943 --> 10:49.777
DID YOU?
WHAT?!

10:49.810 --> 10:51.012
THAT'S COMING UP

10:51.045 --> 10:52.179
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

10:58.486 --> 11:00.054
YOU COMING BACK HERE
ASKING ME,

11:00.087 --> 11:01.188
"WHAT'S IN THIS?
WHAT'S IN THAT?"

11:01.222 --> 11:02.456
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT  ALREADY.

11:05.092 --> 11:06.594
YOU SHUT THE  UP!

11:06.627 --> 11:08.129
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:08.162 --> 11:09.630
SHE'S ALWAYS WANTS
TO BLAME PEOPLE

11:09.664 --> 11:11.165
FOR OTHER.

11:11.198 --> 11:13.034
SHE SHOULD KNOW THE MENU.
DON'T COME BACK THERE ASKING ME.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.135
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN
THE  KITCHEN?

11:14.168 --> 11:15.469
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S FROZEN.
- WHAT'S NOT.

11:15.503 --> 11:16.070
WHAT THE
YOU GOTTA ASK ME FOR?

11:16.103 --> 11:17.238
RIGHT.

11:17.271 --> 11:20.207
WHAT WAS FINE DINING ABOUT
MY LUNCH THERE?

11:20.241 --> 11:21.609
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:21.642 --> 11:23.244
OKAY, LET'S PUT IT
THIS WAY THEN.

11:23.277 --> 11:24.787
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A PILE OF.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.247
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A PILE OF.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.815
I WAS EMBARRASSED FOR YOU.

11:27.848 --> 11:29.717
OKAY.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.620
YOU CAN'T SERVE  LAMB
WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

11:32.653 --> 11:33.854
I MEAN, ARE YOU MAD?

11:33.888 --> 11:35.623
THERE WAS NO MEAT
ON THE LAMB.

11:35.656 --> 11:37.491
YOU WANT TO BLAME ME
FOR NO MEAT ON THE LAMB?

11:37.525 --> 11:39.093
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE BUY HERE,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SERVE.

11:39.126 --> 11:39.927
RICKY, IT'S ON THE MENU
AT $27.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.595
NOBODY ELSE COMPLAINED
ABOUT IT.

11:41.629 --> 11:43.330
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE
IN THE RESTAURANT.

11:43.364 --> 11:44.965
HE WAS BITCHING ABOUT

11:44.999 --> 11:46.400
THE CHOCOLATE MINT SAUCE
ON THE LAMB.

11:46.434 --> 11:48.269
PEOPLE LIKE THAT,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

11:48.302 --> 11:49.670
THEY COME IN HERE AND ORDER IT
ALL THE TIME.

11:49.704 --> 11:50.838
SO I'M NOT GONNA PULL THAT
FROM MY MENU

11:50.871 --> 11:51.605
JUST BECAUSE
HE DON'T LIKE IT.

11:51.639 --> 11:53.174
WHAT WAS FRESH
ON THE MENU?

11:53.207 --> 11:54.787
AS FAR AS
NOT BEING FROZEN?

11:54.787 --> 11:54.875
AS FAR AS
NOT BEING FROZEN?

11:54.909 --> 11:56.577
AS FAR AS NOT BEING FROZEN,
NOT BEING BOUGHT IN?

11:56.610 --> 11:58.446
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
FROZEN.

11:58.479 --> 11:59.980
WE JUST CAN'T
LET STUFF GO BAD.

12:00.014 --> 12:02.316
- HUH?
- HAVE YOU GOT ANY?

12:02.349 --> 12:04.018
I'VE GOT BIG.

12:04.051 --> 12:05.686
JUST 'CAUSE YOU COME HERE
AND CRITICIZE MY PLACE

12:05.720 --> 12:07.521
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
GIVE UP--NO.

12:07.555 --> 12:08.956
WHOSE  DO I THINK ARE
BIGGER?

12:08.989 --> 12:10.091
HIS OR MINE?

12:10.124 --> 12:12.259
PUT IT LIKE THIS.
WE'RE GONNA BUMP HEADS.

12:12.293 --> 12:13.994
I'M STANDING IN FRONT
OF MAN THAT I FEEL

12:14.028 --> 12:14.995
THAT'S GOT HIS NAME
ON HIS JACKET,

12:15.029 --> 12:16.397
ALL THE BIG SHOWBIZ

12:16.430 --> 12:18.265
EMBROIDERY,

12:18.299 --> 12:20.034
AND YET WE'RE SERVING
FROZEN VEGETABLES.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.435
AS A CHEF, DON'T YOU
FEEL EMBARRASSED

12:21.469 --> 12:22.970
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SERVING?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.705
NO, I DON'T.
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T SERVE IT.

12:24.739 --> 12:24.787
ARE YOU LAZY?

12:24.787 --> 12:25.940
ARE YOU LAZY?

12:25.973 --> 12:28.476
I DON'T TAKE NO
FROM NOBODY.

12:37.485 --> 12:40.488
AFTER YESTERDAY'S
FIASCO AT LUNCH,

12:40.521 --> 12:42.056
DAY TWO BEGINS
WITH GORDON INSPECTING

12:42.089 --> 12:47.862
EXECUTIVE CHEF RICKY'S
KITCHEN.

12:47.895 --> 12:49.663
GOD.

12:49.697 --> 12:51.398
A FRIDGE THAT'S NOT EVEN COLD.

12:51.432 --> 12:53.434
THIS IS NOT
A REFRIGERATION UNIT.

12:53.467 --> 12:54.787
THIS IS ALMOST LIKE AN OVEN.

12:54.787 --> 12:54.869
THIS IS ALMOST LIKE AN OVEN.

12:54.902 --> 12:58.205
ALL THIS MEAT IS
VIRTUALLY ROTTING.

12:58.239 --> 13:01.876
DRIED, WARM, CONGEALED BLOOD
AT THE BOTTOM THERE.

13:01.909 --> 13:04.145
THE SMELL IS JUST VILE.

13:04.178 --> 13:06.580
WHAT IS THAT?
GOD.

13:06.614 --> 13:11.185
WHAT A SMELL..

13:11.218 --> 13:14.255
I'M SLOWLY BUT SURELY
DISCOVERING MY LUNCH.

13:14.288 --> 13:15.956
THE BOUGHT-IN
TOMATO AND BAIL SOUP

13:15.990 --> 13:17.792
THAT'S FINISHED
WITH CHILI FLAKES.

13:17.825 --> 13:19.727
THERE'S NOTHING FRESHLY MADE
IN THIS FRIDGE.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.162
HELL.

13:24.732 --> 13:24.787
IT  STINKS.

13:24.787 --> 13:27.201
IT  STINKS.

13:27.234 --> 13:30.838
THE LACK OF CLEANLINESS
REPRESENTS A LACK OF DISCIPLINE.

13:30.871 --> 13:32.306
AND GORDON KNOWS

13:32.339 --> 13:34.074
HE NEEDS TO SEND
A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE STAFF.

13:34.108 --> 13:35.409
WE GOTTA CLEAN.

13:35.442 --> 13:38.379
RICKY, I WANT THE FRIDGE WALLS
SCRUBBED.

13:38.412 --> 13:40.881
THE FLOOR DONE.
YEAH, BUCKET'S BEHIND YOU.

13:40.915 --> 13:43.150
YEAH, TABITHA, TAKE CARE
OF THE DINING ROOM.

13:43.184 --> 13:45.119
GORDON HAD US CLEAN
THE DINING ROOM.

13:45.152 --> 13:47.154
FREAKING SWEEP,
LIKE, THREE TIMES.

13:47.188 --> 13:49.690
MOP, DO ALL THE WINDOWS,
EVERYTHING.

13:49.723 --> 13:51.926
WITH A CONCERN
THAT FINE DINING

13:51.959 --> 13:54.128
MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT
FOR THIS PART OF POMONA,

13:54.161 --> 13:54.787
WHILE THE STAFF CLEANS,
GORDON HITS THE STREETS

13:54.787 --> 13:56.630
WHILE THE STAFF CLEANS,
GORDON HITS THE STREETS

13:56.664 --> 14:00.434
TO CHECK OUT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:00.467 --> 14:01.602
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M REAL GOOD.

14:01.635 --> 14:02.937
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.438
WHAT'S THE VIBE LIKE
HERE IN POMONA?

14:04.471 --> 14:06.574
IT'S YOUNG,
VIBRANT, DIVERSE.

14:06.607 --> 14:08.542
WHAT ABOUT LELA'S?
THE RESTAURANT LELA'S?

14:08.576 --> 14:11.045
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE.

14:11.078 --> 14:12.880
WHAT KIND OF FOOD
DO YOU EAT?

14:12.913 --> 14:14.982
THE PIZZA JOINT RIGHT HERE.
WHAT ABOUT FINE DINING?

14:15.015 --> 14:18.419
USUALLY NOT TOO FANCY.
KIND OF ON A BUDGET.

14:18.452 --> 14:20.487
NO, YOU KEEP THE FANCY STUFF
FOR YOUR ARMS, RIGHT?
YEAH.

14:20.521 --> 14:22.089
AND WHERE WOULD YOU
GO OUT TO EAT?

14:22.122 --> 14:23.624
THERE'S, LIKE, SOME PRETTY
GOOD MEXICAN RESTAURANTS.

14:23.657 --> 14:24.787
BUT, LIKE, BESIDES THAT
THERE ISN'T REALLY ANYWHERE

14:24.787 --> 14:25.426
BUT, LIKE, BESIDES THAT
THERE ISN'T REALLY ANYWHERE

14:25.459 --> 14:27.995
THAT'S, LIKE,
IN OUR PRICE RANGE.

14:28.028 --> 14:31.365
WITH A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT
WILL WORK IN THIS COMMUNITY,

14:31.398 --> 14:32.867
GORDON HEADS BACK TO LELA'S

14:32.900 --> 14:34.835
TO CHECK ON THE STAFF'S
ASSIGNMENT.

14:34.869 --> 14:36.770
NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE.
LOOKS FANTASTIC.

14:36.804 --> 14:39.006
WOW, WOW, WOW.
YES, CLEAN.

14:41.475 --> 14:43.277
WHILE GORDON IS NOW HAPPY

14:43.310 --> 14:45.045
WITH THE CLEANLINESS
OF THE RESTAURANT,

14:45.079 --> 14:48.082
HE IS STILL NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE.

14:48.115 --> 14:50.885
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR SISTER
TOLD ME LAST NIGHT.

14:54.421 --> 14:54.787
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE HOME,
YOU KNOW.

14:54.787 --> 14:56.590
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE HOME,
YOU KNOW.

14:56.624 --> 14:58.626
JUST KIND OF HANG OUT,
TALK TO EVERYBODY ON THE PHONE.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.495
OH!

15:01.528 --> 15:04.398
I JUST LOUNGE.

15:08.335 --> 15:10.204
WE HAVE FUN WHILE
WE'RE IN HERE.

15:10.237 --> 15:11.572
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE USE
OF HAVING A JOB

15:11.605 --> 15:12.973
THAT YOU'RE NOT
HAPPY WITH?

15:13.007 --> 15:14.675
WE HAVEN'T MET YET,
HAVE WE?

15:14.708 --> 15:16.343
NO, I'M--

15:16.377 --> 15:18.846
WHY "BUZZARD?"

15:18.879 --> 15:21.215
HE LIKES TO STAND
IN THE KITCHEN AND EAT.

15:21.248 --> 15:23.617
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS CATCH HIM
WITH SOMETHING IN HIS HAND.

15:23.651 --> 15:24.787
I THINK HE'S GOT A TAPEWORM.

15:24.787 --> 15:25.486
I THINK HE'S GOT A TAPEWORM.

15:25.519 --> 15:27.288
THE EVENING STARTED OUT SLOWLY,

15:27.321 --> 15:29.123
BUT A LOCAL THEATER
HAS LET OUT.

15:29.156 --> 15:31.191
AND A WAVE OF CUSTOMERS HAS
NOW ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT.

15:31.225 --> 15:33.060
GO AHEAD AND FOLLOW ME
AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND SEAT YOU.

15:35.796 --> 15:37.398
ALL RIGHT, RICKY?
YES?

15:37.431 --> 15:39.366
WHERE'S MY SALMON THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SPLIT?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.902
DON'T BE IN SUCH A
HURRY TO DO.

15:41.936 --> 15:43.437
HOLY SMOKE.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.472
IT QUICKLY BECOMES
OBVIOUS TO GORDON

15:45.506 --> 15:47.207
THAT THIS RESTAURANT
DOES NOT HAVE A LEADER,

15:47.241 --> 15:49.643
JUST TWO MAJOR OPPONENTS--

15:49.677 --> 15:51.111
RICKY IN THE KITCHEN

15:51.145 --> 15:53.180
AND TABITHA IN THE FRONT
OF THE HOUSE.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.787
SALMON AND A SEA BASS SPLIT.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.683
SALMON AND A SEA BASS SPLIT.

15:57.351 --> 15:59.253
HUH?

15:59.286 --> 16:01.288
, MAN.

16:01.322 --> 16:04.458
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT WHEN YOU'D SEEN THE TICKET?

16:04.491 --> 16:08.362
I'M, LIKE, REALLY
FRUSTRATED WITH RICKY.

16:08.395 --> 16:09.997
US NOT HAVING EVERYTHING.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.899
THEY'VE BEEN SITTING THERE
FOR 15, 20 MINUTES

16:11.932 --> 16:14.568
WHEN THEIR FOOD SHOULD BE
COMING OUT ANY MINUTE.

16:14.601 --> 16:17.938
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT WE HAVE NO SEA BASS.

16:17.972 --> 16:19.340
OH, FOR.

16:19.373 --> 16:21.141
IS THAT WHAT WE
BOTH ORDERED?
YEAH.

16:21.175 --> 16:22.710
RICKY DOESN'T HAVE MANY

16:22.743 --> 16:24.778
OF THE FOOD ITEMS
THAT ARE ON THE MENU.

16:24.812 --> 16:26.580
AND WHAT THEY DO HAVE IS
PREPACKAGED AND OVERPRICED

16:26.613 --> 16:28.649
FOR THE TOWN OF POMONA.

16:28.682 --> 16:30.184
I JUST TASTED THIS.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.119
IT TASTES LIKE
POWDERED MASHED POTATOES.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.988
THEY ARE.
THEY TASTE ALL RIGHT.

16:34.021 --> 16:35.923
YOU PUT A LITTLE BUTTER
IN THEM, WHATEVER.

16:35.956 --> 16:37.257
PUT THE SAUCE OVER THEM.
THEY TASTE OKAY.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.226
NOBODY'S EVER
COMPLAINED ABOUT 'EM.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.862
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
HE WAS USING INSTANT POTATOES.

16:41.895 --> 16:44.264
I THINK RICKY'S
A LITTLE LAZY.

16:44.298 --> 16:47.701
HOLY MACKEREL.
IT'S OUT OF DATE.

16:47.735 --> 16:49.470
YEAH, LOOK AT THE DATE.
IT'S FEBRUARY 16.

16:49.503 --> 16:50.738
WHAT'S THE TODAY?

16:50.771 --> 16:52.006
DO NOT SERVE
THAT  CAKE.

16:52.039 --> 16:54.787
END OF  STORY, YES?

16:54.787 --> 16:55.409
END OF  STORY, YES?

16:55.442 --> 16:57.111
THEN IN A DINNER SERVICE

16:57.144 --> 16:59.013
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
SMOOTH SAILING,

16:59.046 --> 17:01.081
SOME OF THE STAFF
START ABANDONING SHIP.

17:07.354 --> 17:10.290
ARE YOU FINISHED OR--

17:10.324 --> 17:12.426
WHERE--WHERE'S BUZZARD?
HAVE THEY ALL GONE?

17:14.895 --> 17:17.131
THAT'S THE BUZZARD, THOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

17:17.164 --> 17:20.601
HE'S ALWAYS WAITING TO GRAB
SOMETHING WITH HIS DAMN CLAWS.

17:20.634 --> 17:23.871
BUZZARD AND ONE OF THE COOKS
HAVE WALKED OFF.

17:23.904 --> 17:24.787
BUT THEY ARE NOT
EMPTY-HANDED.

17:24.787 --> 17:25.939
BUT THEY ARE NOT
EMPTY-HANDED.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.307
YOU SCARED ME
, MAN!

17:27.341 --> 17:28.575
I ALMOST HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

17:28.609 --> 17:29.943
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
IN THERE?

17:29.977 --> 17:31.879
GOT A SANDWICH
FROM EARLIER.

17:31.912 --> 17:33.781
SOME PASTA THAT SOMEBODY
ORDERED AND THEY DIDN'T WANT.

17:33.814 --> 17:35.382
LAMB IN THERE
AS WELL.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.184
YEAH.
OKAY.

17:37.217 --> 17:38.585
DID YOU ASK
ANYONE FOR IT?

17:38.619 --> 17:39.853
NO.

17:39.887 --> 17:42.289
YOU NEED TO GO TALK
TO HER AND LET HER KNOW.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.391
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

17:44.425 --> 17:47.995
- OKAY, I'LL COME WITH YOU.
- , WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

17:48.028 --> 17:49.830
WE WONDER WHY
THERE'S THINGS MISSING

17:49.863 --> 17:52.533
AFTER HE'S GONE.

17:52.566 --> 17:54.435
THIS IS BUZZARD'S
LITTLE PICNIC.

17:54.468 --> 17:54.787
NICE LITTLE SANDWICH THERE.
HAM, CHEESE, MUSTARD.

17:54.787 --> 17:57.071
NICE LITTLE SANDWICH THERE.
HAM, CHEESE, MUSTARD.

17:57.104 --> 17:58.839
OH, NICE BIG SALAD.

17:58.872 --> 18:01.475
AND MAIN COURSE, WE'RE GONNA
TACKLE SOME NEW ZEALAND LAMB.

18:01.508 --> 18:03.410
NOW YOU KNOW WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.
STOP LAUGHING.

18:03.444 --> 18:04.912
HERE WE ARE

18:04.945 --> 18:06.880
WITH A RESTAURANT'S THAT
FINANCIALLY  SCREWED,

18:06.914 --> 18:08.949
AND YOU'RE JUST
HELPING YOURSELF

18:08.982 --> 18:11.051
TO WINE
AND A FOUR-COURSE DINNER.

18:11.085 --> 18:13.420
HE TAKES LITTLE THINGS
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

18:13.454 --> 18:15.355
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A WHILE.

18:18.425 --> 18:20.627
WE'RE NOT GONNA ARGUE.
THIS LADY OWNS IT.

18:20.661 --> 18:23.597
BUZZARD.
MAN, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF YOU.

18:23.630 --> 18:24.765
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:31.863 --> 18:33.798
GORDON CAUGHT BUZZARD

18:33.831 --> 18:36.601
TAKING FOOD AND WINE
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.503
AND GORDON IS NOT HAPPY.

18:38.536 --> 18:40.438
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND ARGUE WITH YOU.

18:40.471 --> 18:43.007
WE'RE NOT GONNA ARGUE.
THIS LADY OWNS IT.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.142
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:44.175 --> 18:45.310
WE WERE THINKING

18:45.343 --> 18:46.544
THAT HE WAS DOING THAT,

18:46.578 --> 18:47.879
BUT I HADN'T CAUGHT HIM
IN THE ACT.

18:47.912 --> 18:50.982
AND TODAY--
WELL, THERE IT IS.

18:53.985 --> 18:55.620
ALMIGHTY, GUYS!

18:55.653 --> 18:58.808
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

18:58.808 --> 19:00.625
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

19:00.658 --> 19:03.428
JUST THE BASICS ISN'T EVEN
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

19:03.461 --> 19:05.430
I CAN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

19:05.463 --> 19:07.398
FOR THE WHOLE RESTAURANT
FAILING.

19:07.432 --> 19:09.000
IT'S, YOU KNOW--THIS IS
A TEAM EFFORT HERE.

19:09.033 --> 19:11.502
WHY DID YOU BECOME A CHEF?

19:11.536 --> 19:13.571
BECAUSE I HAVE A PASSION
FOR FOOD, THAT'S WHY.

19:13.605 --> 19:14.839
A PASSION FOR WHAT?

19:14.872 --> 19:16.174
FOOD!

19:16.207 --> 19:19.077
YOU'RE MAKING
POWDERED MASHED POTATO.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.012
YOU TALK ABOUT
THE MASHED POTATOES.

19:21.045 --> 19:22.614
I DIDN'T HEAR NOT ONE PERSON
COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM TONIGHT.

19:22.647 --> 19:24.616
DID YOU YOU?
WHAT?!

19:24.649 --> 19:25.917
DID YOU?

19:25.950 --> 19:28.019
WHEN RICKY AND GORDON
WERE GOING AT IT,

19:28.052 --> 19:28.808
I REALLY WANTED TO JUST,
LIKE, TELL RICKY TO SHUT UP.

19:28.808 --> 19:29.988
I REALLY WANTED TO JUST,
LIKE, TELL RICKY TO SHUT UP.

19:30.021 --> 19:31.823
WHERE'S YOUR RESPECT?

19:31.856 --> 19:33.358
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHERE'S MY RESPECT?

19:33.391 --> 19:35.126
FOR YOUR PROFESSIONALISM.

19:35.159 --> 19:38.363
YOU ARE NOT AN EXECUTIVE CHEF.
LET'S GET THAT RIGHT.

19:38.396 --> 19:40.565
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.700
YOU BACK A DOG INTO A CORNER,
EVENTUALLY--

19:42.734 --> 19:44.035
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING--
HE'S GONNA BITE, YOU KNOW?

19:44.068 --> 19:46.371
I'D RATHER CHANGE
MY CAREER

19:46.404 --> 19:50.208
THAN MAKE IT OUT
OF POWDERED MASH.

19:50.241 --> 19:52.410
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY
BEFORE WE GO HOME?

19:52.443 --> 19:55.647
I JUST HOPE EVERYBODY'S
ATTITUDE CHANGES TOMORROW

19:55.680 --> 19:57.582
SO WE CAN TURN
THIS RESTAURANT AROUND.

19:57.615 --> 19:58.808
IF YOU STILL HAVE ATTITUDE,

19:58.808 --> 19:59.951
IF YOU STILL HAVE ATTITUDE,

19:59.984 --> 20:02.287
THEN THERE'S GONNA
HAVE TO BE SOME CHANGES.

20:11.963 --> 20:13.965
IT'S DAY THREE.

20:13.998 --> 20:16.734
AND GORDON IS ABOUT TO PUT
HIS PLAN INTO ACTION.

20:16.768 --> 20:20.571
BUT ONE OF LAST NIGHT'S
PROBLEMS HAS RETURNED.

20:20.605 --> 20:23.174
BUZZARD'S HERE.

20:23.207 --> 20:24.809
WHERE IS HE?
IN THE BACK.

20:29.047 --> 20:30.715
I HATE
TO HAVE TO FIRE ANYBODY.

20:30.748 --> 20:32.517
BUT THEN YOU GET
TO THE POINT WHERE,

20:32.550 --> 20:34.118
YOU KNOW, IF I CAN'T
GET THEM TO CHANGE

20:34.152 --> 20:36.254
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
OR WHATEVER, THEN I HAVE TO

20:36.287 --> 20:37.622
GET RID OF THEM.

20:37.655 --> 20:42.493
CAN I SEE YOUR EYES?
TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF?

20:42.527 --> 20:44.796
BUZZARD, ANYTHING THAT'S
INSIDE THIS RESTAURANT

20:44.829 --> 20:46.331
BELONGS TO LELA.

20:46.364 --> 20:48.299
YEAH?
YEAH, END OF STORY.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.335
NOTHING GETS TAKEN
OFF THESE PREMISES.

20:50.368 --> 20:53.805
IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
I'D FIRE BUZZARD'S ASS.

20:53.838 --> 20:55.573
I GET LOTS OF PEOPLE
STEALING FROM ME.

20:55.606 --> 20:57.275
AND I JUST HAVE
ONE DISCIPLINE.

20:57.308 --> 20:58.808
ANYONE STEALS FROM ME
IS OUT, END OF STORY.

20:58.808 --> 20:59.444
ANYONE STEALS FROM ME
IS OUT, END OF STORY.

20:59.477 --> 21:01.112
BECAUSE THE MESSAGE
YOU SEND--

21:01.145 --> 21:03.247
THEY ALL SEE YOU DOING IT,
THEY'LL DO IT.

21:03.281 --> 21:05.183
ANYWAY, LELA, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GOTTA MAKE THE DECISION.

21:05.216 --> 21:07.151
IT'S YOUR RESTAURANT.
YEAH.

21:07.185 --> 21:09.587
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE IT.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.522
ALL RIGHT?
UH-HUH.

21:11.556 --> 21:12.890
THIS IS IT.

21:15.593 --> 21:17.895
BUZZARD AIN'T GONNA BE
BACK HERE.

21:17.929 --> 21:19.430
HE AIN'T GONNA BE
BUZZING AROUND HERE.

21:19.464 --> 21:20.465
AND HE'S TRULY A BUZZARD.

21:20.498 --> 21:21.866
LET ME GET MY BAG
AND MY THINGS.

21:21.899 --> 21:23.735
OKAY.

21:23.768 --> 21:25.870
NOW THAT BUZZARD
HAS BEEN LET GO,

21:25.903 --> 21:27.372
GORDON TURNS HIS ATTENTION
BACK TO THE CHEFS.

21:27.405 --> 21:28.808
OKAY, RICKY,
LET'S GO.

21:28.808 --> 21:29.607
OKAY, RICKY,
LET'S GO.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.675
OH, BOY.

21:34.278 --> 21:36.514
OKAY, A LITTLE
TASTE TEST, YEAH?

21:36.547 --> 21:38.182
LAST NIGHT FOR ME THERE WASN'T
ENOUGH TASTING GOING ON.

21:38.216 --> 21:40.051
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH
IDENTIFICATION.

21:40.084 --> 21:42.487
SO I'M GONNA PASS YOU
A LITTLE BIT OF FOOD.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.389
AND I WANT YOU TO TASTE
IT, OKAY?

21:44.422 --> 21:46.023
AND THEN I'M GONNA ASK YOU
WHAT IT IS, OKAY?

21:46.057 --> 21:47.725
ARE YOU READY?
YEAH.

21:47.759 --> 21:49.427
YEAH, GOOD.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.629
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
WHEN HE BLINDFOLDED US.

21:51.662 --> 21:53.097
FOR THE MOST PART,
I DO TASTE MY FOOD.

21:53.131 --> 21:54.799
OKAY, GOOD.

21:54.832 --> 21:57.368
SO... ONE OF
MY FAVORITE MEATS.

21:57.402 --> 21:58.703
RICKY, WHAT WAS THAT?

21:58.736 --> 21:58.808
IT WAS BEEF.

21:58.808 --> 22:00.104
IT WAS BEEF.

22:00.138 --> 22:02.006
LEX?

22:02.039 --> 22:03.341
TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

22:03.374 --> 22:04.509
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.177
RICKY, YOU'RE WRONG.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.012
THAT WAS CHICKEN.

22:08.045 --> 22:09.547
WHAT?!

22:09.580 --> 22:12.350
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MISTAKE
CHICKEN FOR BEEF?

22:12.383 --> 22:13.751
THAT JUST BLEW ME
OUT OF THE WATER.

22:18.356 --> 22:19.757
RICKY, WHAT WAS THAT?

22:19.791 --> 22:21.359
I'D SAY IT WAS PORK.

22:21.392 --> 22:22.960
PORK?

22:22.994 --> 22:24.862
LEX, WHAT WAS THAT?

22:24.896 --> 22:27.031
TASTES LIKE NEW YORK BEEF.

22:28.166 --> 22:28.808
YEAH, LEX,
IT'S NEW YORK STRIP.

22:28.808 --> 22:32.003
YEAH, LEX,
IT'S NEW YORK STRIP.

22:32.036 --> 22:34.505
WE ALREADY KNEW
THAT LEX WAS GONNA GET MORE,

22:34.539 --> 22:36.307
BECAUSE RICKY DOESN'T
TASTE HIS FOOD.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.708
DID YOU BRUSH
YOUR TEETH THIS MORNING?

22:39.710 --> 22:42.246
HOLY MACKEREL!
ALL RIGHT, BLINDFOLDS OFF.

22:44.916 --> 22:48.519
I EXPECTED YOU
TO GET ALL OF THESE RIGHT,

22:48.553 --> 22:50.154
AND YOU DIDN'T.

22:50.188 --> 22:52.890
OUT OF BOTH OF YOU,
WHO IS THE BETTER COOK?

22:52.924 --> 22:53.958
I'M THE BETTER COOK.

22:53.991 --> 22:55.460
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM.

22:55.493 --> 22:57.995
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
PROVED IT ON THE TASTE TEST.

22:58.029 --> 22:58.808
THANK YOU.

22:58.808 --> 22:59.397
THANK YOU.

22:59.430 --> 23:01.632
I AM THE BETTER CHEF.
DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.100
WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

23:03.134 --> 23:04.969
RICKY, YOU HAPPY
WITH THAT?

23:05.002 --> 23:06.437
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

23:06.471 --> 23:08.072
LEX SAYING HE'S A BETTER
CHEF THAT ME.

23:08.105 --> 23:08.940
I KNOW WHERE
MY SKILLS ARE AT.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.641
I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO.

23:10.675 --> 23:12.310
I KNOW WHAT I DO IN HERE
ON A DAILY BASIS, YOU KNOW.

23:12.343 --> 23:14.045
I THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE A SWITCH AROUND, YES?

23:14.078 --> 23:17.148
LELA, I JUST FOUND YOU
A NEW HEAD CHEF.

23:18.950 --> 23:20.651
DON'T EXPECT YOU TO JUST
BARK AT ME

23:20.685 --> 23:22.487
AND NOT EXPECT ME
TO SAY NOTHING BACK.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.955
'CAUSE THAT
AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

23:23.988 --> 23:26.924
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
FROM YOU.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.808
COMING UP,
AT LELA'S GRAND REOPENING,

23:28.808 --> 23:29.894
COMING UP,
AT LELA'S GRAND REOPENING,

23:29.927 --> 23:31.095
SERVICE GETS DERAILED.

23:31.128 --> 23:32.663
IT'S LIKE A TRAIN WRECK.

23:32.697 --> 23:34.332
IT'S NOT ONLY THE FRONT
OF THE HOUSE'S FAULT.

23:34.365 --> 23:36.033
DON'T BLAME
THAT  ON US.

23:36.067 --> 23:37.502
AND WHEN ONE CHEF CAN'T
STAND THE HEAT,

23:37.535 --> 23:39.270
HE GETS OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

23:39.303 --> 23:41.172
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

23:41.205 --> 23:42.006
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE IT, THEN LEAVE.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.674
ALL RIGHT!

23:43.708 --> 23:45.142
IT'S A DINNER SERVICE
THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU.

23:45.176 --> 23:46.611
OH!

23:46.644 --> 23:49.514
THAT'S COMING UP
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.753
DAY FOUR.

23:56.787 --> 23:58.422
AND TO GET READY
FOR TONIGHT'S RE-LAUNCH,

23:58.455 --> 24:01.325
GORDON MOVES TO THE NEXT
PHASE OF HIS PLAN.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.460
BUT FIRST, A SURPRISE
FOR THE OWNER.

24:03.493 --> 24:06.096
YOU, MY DEAR, YEAH,
FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS,

24:06.129 --> 24:08.131
OKAY, HAVE BEEN TAKING
CARE OF EVERYBODY.

24:08.165 --> 24:09.299
YES.
YEAH.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.601
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THAT ANY LONGER.

24:10.634 --> 24:13.503
I'VE ARRANGED FOR YOU
TO GO OFF

24:13.537 --> 24:14.938
SOMEWHERE REALLY LUXURIOUS

24:14.972 --> 24:16.273
AND TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

24:16.306 --> 24:18.108
YOU'RE GOING
OFF THIS AFTERNOON

24:18.141 --> 24:20.110
FOR A BIT OF A MAKEOVER,
PAMPERING.

24:20.143 --> 24:20.896
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE DAY OFF.

24:20.896 --> 24:22.846
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE DAY OFF.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.315
AND NOT HAVING TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS PLACE

24:25.349 --> 24:27.284
AND KIND OF RELAX
A LITTLE BIT.

24:27.317 --> 24:29.686
HI, WELCOME TO SAVOIE.
I'M SHERRY.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.521
I'M LELA.
I HEAR YOU'RE
IN NEED OF A PAMPERING.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.890
COME ON OVER.

24:32.923 --> 24:34.491
WHILE LELA GETS HER MAKEOVER,

24:34.524 --> 24:36.226
GORDON BEGINS
TO CHANGE THE MENU

24:36.260 --> 24:38.896
FROM FINE DINING
TO CONTEMPORARY CASUAL,

24:38.929 --> 24:41.198
STARTING WITH
A SIGNATURE SALAD.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.933
I WANT YOU TO THINK
BOTH OF YOU, YEAH,

24:42.966 --> 24:44.668
OF A POMONA SALAD.

24:44.701 --> 24:46.770
POMONA.
IT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT.

24:46.803 --> 24:48.372
JUST OVER THE NEXT HOUR,

24:48.405 --> 24:50.896
PUT TOGETHER A POMONA SALAD.

24:50.896 --> 24:51.775
PUT TOGETHER A POMONA SALAD.

24:51.808 --> 24:53.343
I WANT YOU TO THINK
OF SOMETHING EXCITING.

24:53.377 --> 24:54.678
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

24:54.711 --> 24:56.246
THIS IS HOW
CAESAR SALAD STARTED.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.616
IF BLOODY CAESAR CAN DO IT,
POMONA CAN DO IT.

24:59.650 --> 25:01.151
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
GO THROUGH THE FRIDGE

25:01.184 --> 25:02.286
LOOK AT THE PEPPERS,

25:02.319 --> 25:03.754
WHETHER YOU GRILL THEM,
SAUTEE THEM.

25:03.787 --> 25:04.922
SWEET AND SOUR, BARBECUE.
I DON'T CARE.

25:04.955 --> 25:06.523
GIVE IT SOME ATTITUDE.

25:06.556 --> 25:08.625
WELL, THE POMONA SALAD
HE BASICALLY SAID, YOU KNOW,

25:08.659 --> 25:10.694
TRY TO GET THE FEEL
OF POMONA HERE.

25:10.727 --> 25:13.130
MAYBE A LITTLE SALT IN THERE
IT'LL WEIGH, ABSOLUTE TIP TOP.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.799
GET THE BLACK BEANS ONTO THERE
AND THE CHICKEN ONTO THERE.

25:15.832 --> 25:17.868
THIS GUY JUST OPENED UP
A $3 MILLION RESTAURANT.

25:17.901 --> 25:19.436
OF COURSE I'M GONNA
TRY AND GET

25:19.469 --> 25:20.896
ALL THE POINTERS
I CAN FROM HIM.

25:20.896 --> 25:20.971
ALL THE POINTERS
I CAN FROM HIM.

25:21.004 --> 25:22.539
IT'S LIKE I'M BACK
IN SCHOOL, YOU KNOW.

25:22.572 --> 25:24.541
I FELT LIKE I WAS RIGHT BACK
IN THE CLASSROOM.

25:24.574 --> 25:26.643
YOU KNOW, SCURRYING AROUND
IN THE WALK-IN.

25:26.677 --> 25:28.679
LOOKING FOR THIS.
LOOKING AND A'REACHING.

25:28.712 --> 25:29.947
"WHAT CAN I PUT IN THIS?"
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

25:29.980 --> 25:31.448
ALL RIGHT, WASH YOUR HANDS.

25:31.481 --> 25:33.383
CLEAR THE BENCH OFF,
LEX, PLEASE

25:33.417 --> 25:34.651
I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE, BOTH OF YOU, YEAH.

25:34.685 --> 25:38.055
WE HAVE A NEW
POMONA SALAD.

25:38.088 --> 25:41.224
A SALAD THAT IS IN KEEPING
WITH THE AREA.

25:41.258 --> 25:45.362
IT'S FRESH, IT'S NEW,
IT'S VIBRANT.

25:45.395 --> 25:47.564
THE POMONA SALAD IS WONDERFUL.

25:47.597 --> 25:50.067
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE
THE TASTE TO IT,

25:50.100 --> 25:50.896
BUT IT JUST--IT TASTES
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

25:50.896 --> 25:52.202
BUT IT JUST--IT TASTES
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

25:52.235 --> 25:55.038
I'VE WALKED UP AND DOWN
THE STREETS.

25:55.072 --> 25:58.542
SAW CHINESE FOOD,
MEXICAN FOOD, A PIZZERIA.

25:58.575 --> 26:01.178
AND WHAT NO ONE
HAS OUT THERE

26:01.211 --> 26:02.779
IS A BLOODY GOOD BURGER.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.581
AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU

26:04.614 --> 26:06.783
HOW TO MAKE A STUNNING,
DELICIOUS BURGER.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.618
YOU KNOW,
I COULD'VE MADE A BURGER.

26:08.652 --> 26:10.153
BUT A BURGER TO ME
IS BASIC.

26:10.187 --> 26:11.688
CHOPPED BEEF,
SALT, PEPPER,

26:11.722 --> 26:12.723
DIJON MUSTARD,

26:12.756 --> 26:13.890
WORCHESTER SAUCE,

26:13.924 --> 26:15.492
KETCHUP,
FINELY CHOPPED ONIONS,

26:15.525 --> 26:17.728
THREE EGG YOLKS
TO BIND IT TOGETHER.

26:17.761 --> 26:19.963
REALLY IMPORTANT TO MIX
ALL THAT THROUGH, YEAH?

26:19.997 --> 26:20.896
YES.
REALLY IMPORTANT.

26:20.896 --> 26:21.698
YES.
REALLY IMPORTANT.

26:21.732 --> 26:23.100
TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA DO
A SPECIAL

26:23.133 --> 26:25.135
LELA'S FAMOUS BURGER, YES?

26:25.168 --> 26:27.037
IT'LL BE THE BEST BURGER
IN POMONA.

26:27.070 --> 26:29.539
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
OUR LELA'S FAMOUS BURGER

26:29.573 --> 26:31.508
IS REALLY GONNA HELP US
ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE.

26:31.541 --> 26:34.444
GRILL IT NICELY.
THIS IS PERFECT, THIS GRILL.

26:34.478 --> 26:36.680
HAVE A LITTLE TASTE.

26:36.713 --> 26:38.215
SEASON-WISE THAT'S FINE.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.217
LET'S PUT THE BURGER ON
AS A SPECIAL TONIGHT.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.985
CHEF GORDON, HE WAS RIGHT

26:42.019 --> 26:43.820
WHEN HE SAID
THAT WE NEEDED A BURGER.

26:43.854 --> 26:45.589
YOU CAN'T GET A BURGER
AROUND HERE NOWHERE.

26:45.622 --> 26:47.224
POMONA NEEDS A GREAT BURGER.

26:47.257 --> 26:50.427
AND TONIGHT,
IT'S GONNA GET ONE.

26:50.460 --> 26:50.896
THE RECIPE TO THE LELA'S BURGER
IS TOP SECRET.

26:50.896 --> 26:52.662
THE RECIPE TO THE LELA'S BURGER
IS TOP SECRET.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.531
I COULD TELL YOU, BUT THEN
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

26:56.433 --> 26:58.235
ARMED WITH LELA'S
NEW HAMBURGERS,

26:58.268 --> 27:00.604
A CATERING TRUCK,
AND ENTHUSIASM,

27:00.637 --> 27:02.172
GORDON AND THE STAFF
HIT THE STREETS

27:02.205 --> 27:04.241
TO PROMOTE THE RESTAURANT.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.343
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN A FREE BURGER?
SURE!

27:06.376 --> 27:08.345
I'D LOVE A FREE BURGER.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.313
I THINK THAT THE WORD
WILL GET OUT ON THE STREET

27:10.347 --> 27:12.482
THAT WE HAVE A REALLY
JUICY BURGER.

27:12.516 --> 27:14.518
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.519
- FREE BURGER?
- FREE BURGER.

27:15.552 --> 27:17.621
SIR, HOW WAS IT?
NICE?

27:17.654 --> 27:19.689
WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER ONE?
I'M GONNA GET ANOTHER ONE.

27:19.723 --> 27:20.690
IT'S ALSO GONNA GET
ON THE STREET

27:20.724 --> 27:20.896
THAT CHEF GORDON MADE IT.

27:20.896 --> 27:22.059
THAT CHEF GORDON MADE IT.

27:22.092 --> 27:24.161
SURPRISING HOW HAPPY
EVERYBODY IS

27:24.194 --> 27:26.096
ON THE BACK OF A REALLY GOOD,
DELICIOUS, SIMPLE BURGER.

27:26.129 --> 27:28.832
THE GRUBBAGE IS EXCELLENT!

27:28.865 --> 27:32.235
WHILE THE STAFF PROMOTES
THE NEW BURGERS,

27:32.269 --> 27:34.704
GORDON'S DESIGN TEAM
MAKES OVER THE RESTAURANT

27:34.738 --> 27:36.973
IN ANTICIPATION
OF TONIGHT'S RE-LAUNCH.

27:37.007 --> 27:39.209
WE'VE GOT A NEW PLAN.
A NEW MENU.

27:39.242 --> 27:40.544
AND A NEW INTERIOR.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.780
LELA'S HAS BEEN
GIVEN A NEW LOOK.

27:43.814 --> 27:47.517
A NEW UNINTIMIDATING
YET WARM PLACE, YES?
YES.

27:47.551 --> 27:48.852
SPEAKING OF NEW LOOKS.

27:48.885 --> 27:50.887
LELA, WHERE ARE YOU,
MY DARLING?

27:50.921 --> 27:52.923
HERE WE ARE.
LOOK AT YOU!

27:55.525 --> 27:57.194
LOOK AT YOU!

27:57.227 --> 27:59.563
HELLO!
GOOD MORNING!

27:59.596 --> 28:01.465
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MY DARLING.

28:01.498 --> 28:03.500
WHEN I SEE LELA
COME AROUND THE CORNER,

28:03.533 --> 28:06.203
IT MADE ME CRY, BECAUSE
SHE LOOKED SO MUCH HAPPIER.

28:06.236 --> 28:08.205
HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MY DARLING?
GOOD.

28:08.238 --> 28:10.140
YEAH, LET ME SAY,
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THANK YOU.

28:10.173 --> 28:11.808
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A LADY

28:11.842 --> 28:13.743
THAT'S CARRYING THE WORLD
ON HER SHOULDERS ANYMORE.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.312
WHEN THE SAW ME,
THEY SAID,

28:15.345 --> 28:17.147
"OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT!"

28:17.180 --> 28:18.982
I SAID, "YES, YOU HAVE
A NEW BOSS."

28:19.015 --> 28:20.350
ARE YOU READY TO SEE

28:20.383 --> 28:20.896
THE NEW HOT SPOT
IN DOWNTOWN POMONA?

28:20.896 --> 28:22.953
THE NEW HOT SPOT
IN DOWNTOWN POMONA?

28:22.986 --> 28:25.088
CAN WE OPEN IT?

28:25.122 --> 28:26.556
OKAY ARE WE READY?
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

28:26.590 --> 28:30.093
ONE, TWO, THREE... GO!

28:33.663 --> 28:36.433
COME IN, COME IN, COME IN,
COME IN, COME IN, COME IN!

28:36.466 --> 28:38.301
WHEN THEY OPENED UP
THE DOORS,

28:38.335 --> 28:39.269
I WAS REALLY SHOCKED
AND SURPRISED.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.004
IT LOOKED SO MUCH NICER.

28:41.037 --> 28:44.107
IT'S WARM, YES?
AND IT'S INVITING.

28:44.141 --> 28:47.344
IT'S NO LONGER STARK
AND COLD.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.212
I LOVE THIS!

28:49.246 --> 28:50.896
YOU GOT THE RECEPTION HERE.
YOU GOT CHAIRS TO SIT DOWN.

28:50.896 --> 28:51.848
YOU GOT THE RECEPTION HERE.
YOU GOT CHAIRS TO SIT DOWN.

28:51.882 --> 28:56.019
WHAT FIRST CAUGHT MY EYE
WAS THE RED COUCH, THE CANDLES.

28:56.052 --> 28:58.021
IT'S LIKE, WHY DIDN'T
WE THINK OF THAT, YOU KNOW?

28:58.054 --> 29:00.690
IT'S IN KEEPING
WITH DOWNTOWN POMONA.

29:00.724 --> 29:03.894
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT OUR STATION!

29:03.927 --> 29:05.295
I THINK THAT GORDON DID
THE RIGHT THING

29:05.328 --> 29:06.663
FOR OUR RESTAURANT.

29:06.696 --> 29:08.865
JUST MORE POSITIVE ENERGY
FROM ALL OF US.

29:08.899 --> 29:10.934
IT'S ONE HOUR
BEFORE THE OPENING,

29:10.967 --> 29:13.203
AND GORDON HAS MAINSTREAMED
THE MENU.

29:13.236 --> 29:14.738
GONE ARE THE FINE DINING
EFFORTS

29:14.771 --> 29:16.173
LIKE CHOCOLATE LAMB CHOPS

29:16.206 --> 29:18.675
AND SOGGY CHICKEN NACHOS.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.677
AND IN THEIR PLACE
ARE POPULAR FARE

29:20.710 --> 29:20.896
LIKE LELA'S FAMOUS BURGERS
AND THE NEW POMONA SALAD.

29:20.896 --> 29:25.148
LIKE LELA'S FAMOUS BURGERS
AND THE NEW POMONA SALAD.

29:25.182 --> 29:28.451
ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO
IS GET THE PERSONNEL IN ORDER.

29:28.485 --> 29:30.353
WE NEED A LEADER,
WE NEED A MANGER,

29:30.387 --> 29:33.590
AND WE NEED TO INSTALL
SOME FORM OF DISCIPLINE.

29:33.623 --> 29:36.326
TABITHA, MANAGE THE PLACE,
YEAH?

29:36.359 --> 29:38.962
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME
THAT GORDON WENT

29:38.995 --> 29:41.031
WITH THE WHOLE IDEA
OF ME BECOMING MANAGER.

29:41.064 --> 29:43.567
THAT JUST SHOWS ME THAT
HE KNOWS THAT I CAN DO IT.

29:43.600 --> 29:47.037
LEX, CAN I HAVE YOU
RUNNING THE KITCHEN TONIGHT?

29:47.070 --> 29:50.896
IT'S THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT
I'VE HAD ALL MY LIFE SO FAR.

29:50.896 --> 29:51.041
IT'S THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT
I'VE HAD ALL MY LIFE SO FAR.

29:51.074 --> 29:53.310
RICKY, SUPPORT HIM
PROPERLY, YES?

29:53.343 --> 29:56.246
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.
I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE DAY ONE.

29:56.279 --> 29:58.181
BUSTED MY BUTT,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:58.215 --> 30:01.184
LET'S GET SOME IDENTITY
AND WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

30:01.218 --> 30:02.886
I'D RATHER HAVE SOMEBODY
LIKE LEX

30:02.919 --> 30:05.188
WHO'S PASSIONATE
ABOUT WHAT HE DOES.

30:05.222 --> 30:08.158
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT
RICKY'S ATTITUDE WILL CHANGE.

30:08.191 --> 30:09.926
THIS RESTAURANT NEEDS
TO TURN TABLES TONIGHT

30:09.960 --> 30:11.528
TO STAY OPEN TOMORROW.

30:19.635 --> 30:21.303
IT'S RE-LAUNCH NIGHT.

30:21.337 --> 30:22.471
AND GORDON HAS INVITED
LOCAL ARTISTS,

30:22.504 --> 30:24.873
STUDENTS, AND CAR CLUBS
TO EXPERIENCE

30:24.907 --> 30:26.241
THE NEW LELA'S.

30:26.275 --> 30:28.611
AND NOW, REGARDLESS
OF THE RAIN,

30:28.644 --> 30:30.012
THE RESTAURANT IS PACKED.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.748
OPEN THE NEW LELA'S.
LET'S GO.

30:32.781 --> 30:33.949
ALL RIGHT.
WHOO!

30:33.983 --> 30:35.951
GOOD LUCK, GUYS, YES?
YES.

30:35.985 --> 30:38.420
WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.
LET'S GO.

30:38.454 --> 30:40.856
GOOD EVENING.
HOW ARE YOU?

30:40.889 --> 30:42.558
JUST OPENED THE DOORS
RIGHT NOW, MAN.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.126
WE GOT A HOUSEFUL
OF PEOPLE, MAN.

30:44.159 --> 30:45.894
WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE
AND I SAW THIS LONG LINE,

30:45.928 --> 30:46.848
I SAID, "OH, MY GOD.

30:46.848 --> 30:47.329
I SAID, "OH, MY GOD.

30:47.363 --> 30:48.764
ARE THEY GONNA BE
ABLE TO HANDLE IT?"

30:48.797 --> 30:50.132
IT'S AWESOME.

30:50.165 --> 30:51.700
THIS IS OUR
NEW AND IMPROVED MENU.

30:51.734 --> 30:53.168
I'M PRETTY NERVOUS
ABOUT TONIGHT,

30:53.202 --> 30:56.005
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A BRAND-NEW LELA'S.

30:56.038 --> 30:57.406
THIS IS OUR NEW MENU.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.008
THE RESTAURANT'S MENU

30:59.041 --> 31:00.242
HAS BEEN TOTALLY REVAMPED
BY GORDON

31:00.275 --> 31:02.011
TO BETTER SUIT
THE CASUAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:02.044 --> 31:04.513
AND TONIGHT
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

31:04.546 --> 31:07.950
THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE KITCHEN
IS SOUS CHEF LEX.

31:07.983 --> 31:09.685
LEX IS THE CHEF TONIGHT.
YOU GOT IT.

31:09.718 --> 31:12.221
- YES, IT HURTS.
- I DON'T  CARE.

31:12.254 --> 31:14.223
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA
CRY ABOUT IT.

31:14.256 --> 31:16.692
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN PRETTY MUCH.

31:16.725 --> 31:16.848
LEX?
YES.

31:16.848 --> 31:18.293
LEX?

31:18.327 --> 31:20.062
I WANT YOU CALLING OUT
THE ORDERS TONIGHT, YES?
ALL RIGHT.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.830
YEAH, DON'T FORGET.
GOT IT.

31:21.864 --> 31:23.465
I'M FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS,
A LITTLE NERVOUS,

31:23.499 --> 31:25.234
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A BIG
NIGHT FOR US.

31:25.267 --> 31:26.769
TWO SPECIALS,
BACON AND CHEESE.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.604
COMES WITH BACON, MONTEREY JACK,
AND SWISS CHEESE.

31:28.637 --> 31:32.074
THERE YOU GO.
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.076
OKAY, LET'S GO.
THEY'RE IN.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.412
WITH THE RAIN AS WELL, YEAH?
THEY'RE NOT HANGING AROUND.

31:36.445 --> 31:39.014
THEY'RE JUST COMING
STRAIGHT IN THERE, YES?

31:39.048 --> 31:42.184
AND TO FURTHER ENDEAR THIS
RESTAURANT TO THE COMMUNITY,

31:42.217 --> 31:44.319
GORDON HAS ARRANGED

31:44.353 --> 31:45.721
TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

31:45.754 --> 31:46.848
I WANT YOU TO COME IN
AND SIT DOWN.

31:46.848 --> 31:47.289
I WANT YOU TO COME IN
AND SIT DOWN.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.224
WE HAVE A SPECIAL TABLE

THANK YOU.

31:49.258 --> 31:51.060
WHAT TABLE IS
THE MAYOR SAT ON?

31:51.093 --> 31:53.162
SEE WHERE THAT LADY IS
WITH THE RED--

31:53.195 --> 31:54.196
OKAY, YES.

31:54.229 --> 31:55.397
THAT TABLE.
RIGHT.

31:55.431 --> 31:56.899
ARE WE READY TO ORDER?

31:56.932 --> 31:59.034
RICKY, DON'T  OFF
OUTSIDE ON THE PHONE.

31:59.068 --> 32:00.169
KEEP IT GOING, YES?

32:00.202 --> 32:02.638
ME, LEX, RICKY,

32:02.671 --> 32:04.840
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT
TO MESS UP.

32:04.873 --> 32:06.642
WHAT ARE YOU EATING NOW?

32:06.675 --> 32:07.576
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT YOU
YOU'RE ALWAYS EATING.

32:07.609 --> 32:08.777
THIS IS WORK NOW, YES?

32:08.811 --> 32:10.779
I WANT EVERYONE TO GET
INTO WORK MODE, YES?

32:10.813 --> 32:12.381
AND FOR YOURSELF?

32:12.414 --> 32:13.816
I'M GONNA TRY
THE POT ROAST.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.984
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE BURGER.

32:16.018 --> 32:16.848
THE EVENING
HAS STARTED OFF WELL

32:16.848 --> 32:18.153
THE EVENING
HAS STARTED OFF WELL

32:18.187 --> 32:19.855
WITH CUSTOMERS RESPONDING
FAVORABLY

32:19.888 --> 32:21.657
TO THE NEW CASUAL MENU.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.159
LISTEN, LEX, FIRST TABLE.
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

32:24.193 --> 32:27.830
BUT THE REAL HARD WORK
IS ABOUT TO HIT THE STAFF.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.898
AND A LITTLE STAGE FRIGHT
HAS SET IN.

32:33.102 --> 32:35.804
LEX, WHERE'S THE TICKET GONE
FOR THE TOMATO AND BASIL SOUP?

32:35.838 --> 32:38.173
- IT'S ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.
- HELL.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.812
30 MINUTES INTO SERVICE

32:43.846 --> 32:46.048
AND LELA'S IS OFF
TO A ROCKY START.

32:46.081 --> 32:46.848
WHERE'S THE FIRST TICKET
AT, LEX?

32:46.848 --> 32:47.916
WHERE'S THE FIRST TICKET
AT, LEX?

32:47.950 --> 32:49.685
NO FOOD HAS LEFT
THE KITCHEN,

32:49.718 --> 32:51.887
AND THIS GRAND REOPENING
IS OFF-COURSE.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.822
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE
FALLING BEHIND.

32:53.856 --> 32:56.091
WE'VE GOT TO REV UP
A LITTLE BIT, YEAH, YEAH?

32:56.125 --> 32:57.292
WHAT'S GOING NEXT?

32:57.326 --> 32:58.727
IS THAT THE POMONA SALAD THERE?

32:58.761 --> 33:00.062
- YES.
- NEEDS CHICKEN.

33:00.095 --> 33:01.830
WHERE'S THE CHICKEN?

33:01.864 --> 33:04.800
ABOUT TO GO IN THERE.
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.535
LISTEN, LEX.
YES?

33:06.568 --> 33:10.038
WORK TOGETHER AND SEND
ONE TABLE AT A TIME.
OKAY.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.508
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE--
AHEM--WORKING IN A KITCHEN.

33:12.541 --> 33:14.710
SO I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
GO SCREW IT ALL UP.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.478
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA WORK.

33:16.512 --> 33:16.848
TO BE THE HONEST,

33:16.848 --> 33:17.546
TO BE THE HONEST,

33:17.579 --> 33:18.947
THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN--

33:18.981 --> 33:20.282
PROBABLY LEX
RUNNING THE KITCHEN TONIGHT.

33:20.315 --> 33:21.650
IT'S STARTING
TO BECOME CLEAR NOW.

33:21.683 --> 33:23.552
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM
ARE USED TO BEING BUSY.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.621
SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
SO.

33:25.654 --> 33:27.055
AND THE TUNA SANDWICH.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.290
AND WHEN FOOD FINALLY DOES

33:28.323 --> 33:29.291
COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN,

33:29.324 --> 33:30.659
NOT EVERYONE AT THE TABLE

33:30.692 --> 33:31.960
IS GETTING THEIR FOOD
AT THE SAME TIME.

33:31.994 --> 33:33.996
OH!

33:34.029 --> 33:37.900
SO I'LL JUST EAT THIS,
AND, UM--

33:37.933 --> 33:40.002
COME ON, RICKY.
GOTCHA CHEF,
GOTCHA, GOTCHA!

33:40.035 --> 33:41.637
DON'T PANIC.

33:41.670 --> 33:43.839
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY SEND IT
AT THE SAME  TIME.

33:43.872 --> 33:45.674
YEAH, BACON AND CHEESE,
FIRST ORDER UP.

33:45.707 --> 33:46.848
THE BACON'S NOT EVEN
COOKED.

33:46.848 --> 33:47.176
THE BACON'S NOT EVEN
COOKED.

33:47.209 --> 33:49.011
YOU KNOW, IT'S STONE COLD.
IT'S NOT EVEN CRISPY.

33:49.044 --> 33:50.779
WE GOTTA AT IT PUT IT BACK
ON THE GRILL FOR 3O SECONDS.

33:50.813 --> 33:53.649
- COME ON, GUYS.
- MELTDOWN.

33:56.418 --> 33:59.454
YOU HAVEN'T ANY FOOD
WHATSOEVER.

33:59.488 --> 34:01.490
SEEMS TO BE TAKING A LITTLE
TOO LONG TO GET OUR SALAD.

34:01.523 --> 34:03.192
I'M IRRITATED.

34:03.225 --> 34:05.260
I'M VERY,
VERY IRRITATED TONIGHT.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.863
EVERYTHING IS NOT GOING THE WAY
THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO.

34:07.896 --> 34:10.666
STILL WAITING
FOR A CHICKEN SANDWICH.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.768
OH, MY GOD!

34:12.801 --> 34:14.670
CHICKEN SANDWICH
IS GOING WITH THE--

34:14.703 --> 34:16.471
THEY JUST TOOK THE SALAD,
THEY JUST TOOK THE SALAD.

34:16.505 --> 34:16.848
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:16.848 --> 34:18.307
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:18.340 --> 34:20.275
RICKY AND LEX, NOT PAYING
ATTENTION TO THEIR TICKETS.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.211
OH, DEAR, OH, DEAR.

34:22.244 --> 34:24.213
THE WAIT STAFF
BEGINS TO PANIC.

34:24.246 --> 34:25.414
GET ON THE COMPUTER
AND FIX ALL THAT

34:25.447 --> 34:26.782
SO WE NEED
THE  KEY ANYMORE.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.450
HOW ABOUT THAT?

34:28.483 --> 34:30.452
GRABBING WHATEVER FOOD
IS UP ON THE COUNTER

34:30.485 --> 34:33.388
REGARDLESS OF WHICH TABLE
IT BELONGS TO.

34:33.422 --> 34:35.591
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON IN THE KITCHEN.

34:35.624 --> 34:36.725
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE MY ORDER IS.

34:36.758 --> 34:37.860
LIKE, I DON'T CARE.

34:37.893 --> 34:41.129
FAMOUS BURGER,
TABLE 11.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.631
WHAT DID YOU ORDER?

34:42.664 --> 34:44.700
OH, MAN, THEY PUT
THE WRONG ORDER IN.

34:44.733 --> 34:46.468
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO OUT
WITH TABLE TEN.

34:46.501 --> 34:46.848
CAROLYN, YOU PUT IN
TABLE 11 FOR THIS,

34:46.848 --> 34:48.904
CAROLYN, YOU PUT IN
TABLE 11 FOR THIS,

34:48.937 --> 34:51.173
AND THEY'RE SAYING
IT'S NOT THEIRS.

34:51.206 --> 34:54.409
IT'S A SALMON
AND A CHEESEBURGER.

34:54.443 --> 34:57.279
IT'S LIKE A TRAIN WRECK.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.413
DID YOU HAVE
THE CHICKEN SOUP?

34:58.447 --> 34:59.548
NO, OKAY.

34:59.581 --> 35:02.484
TONIGHT WAS OVERWHELMING.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.887
SORRY!

35:04.920 --> 35:06.855
NO, HE DOESN'T IT. IF I SAID
IT'S COMING, IT'S COMING.

35:06.889 --> 35:08.690
I NEED A CAPELLINI
WITH SHRIMP.

35:08.724 --> 35:10.492
I JUST TOLD YOU
IT'S COMING RIGHT NOW.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.160
DON'T ASK HIM,
'CAUSE HE DON'T KNOW.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.662
ONE HOUR INTO DINNER SERVICE,

35:13.695 --> 35:15.931
AND LEX'S INEXPERIENCE
BEGINS TO SHOW.

35:15.964 --> 35:16.848
THEY'RE TAKING DIFFERENT FOOD
FROM DIFFERENT ORDERS,

35:16.848 --> 35:17.866
THEY'RE TAKING DIFFERENT FOOD
FROM DIFFERENT ORDERS,

35:17.900 --> 35:19.701
AND THAT'S NOT HELPING US
AT ALL.

35:19.735 --> 35:21.403
JUST STAND THERE
AND SAY NOTHING.

35:21.436 --> 35:22.271
I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM.
WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?

35:22.304 --> 35:23.572
I'VE TOLD RICKY ALREADY,

35:23.605 --> 35:24.907
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO TALK TO THEM.

35:24.940 --> 35:25.741
GET ME TABITHA PLEASE, YES?

35:25.774 --> 35:27.242
I'M RIGHT HERE.

35:27.276 --> 35:28.277
LEX WAS TRYING TO SAY

35:28.310 --> 35:29.778
THAT THE WHOLE CONFUSION

35:29.811 --> 35:31.413
WAS BECAUSE
OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

35:31.446 --> 35:33.315
RICKY WANTED TO TRY
TO BLAME THAT EVERYTHING'S

35:33.348 --> 35:34.950
MESSED UP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE,

35:34.983 --> 35:36.285
WHICH IS BULL.

35:36.318 --> 35:37.653
DON'T BLAME THAT
ON US,

35:37.686 --> 35:39.254
'CAUSE IT AIN'T OUR FAULT.

35:39.288 --> 35:40.889
ALL WE DO IS READ THE TICKET
TO PUT THE FOOD OUT.

35:40.923 --> 35:42.658
WE'RE TRYING TO STAY
ON TRACK WITH THE ORDERS,

35:42.691 --> 35:43.859
AND THEY JUST KEEP YELLING OUT
THEY NEED TABLE 55,

35:43.892 --> 35:45.661
THEY NEED THIS TABLE,
THEY NEED THAT TABLE.

35:45.694 --> 35:46.848
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE TRYING

35:46.848 --> 35:47.195
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE TRYING

35:47.229 --> 35:48.864
TO ASK ME 50 MILLION THINGS
AT ONE TIME.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.300
SO IT'S A LOT OF CHAOS.
IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.302
I NEED A POT ROAST
AND A CUP--

35:53.335 --> 35:55.370
YOU NEED IT?
SHE NEEDS IT.

35:55.404 --> 35:56.672
WHERE'S MY FAMOUS
BACON WITH CHEESE?

35:58.106 --> 36:00.075
HURRY UP, HURRY UP.
YOU GOTTA BE FAST, BUDDY.

36:00.108 --> 36:01.243
HE FREEZES.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

36:01.276 --> 36:03.278
I HAVE TO GO BACK THERE
AND ACTUALLY HELP

36:03.312 --> 36:05.180
TELL HIM, OKAY, LOOK, THIS IS
WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

36:05.213 --> 36:06.915
CAN SOMEBODY
PLEASE ANSWER ME!

36:06.949 --> 36:10.018
ALL RIGHT!

36:10.052 --> 36:11.753
LEX, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

36:11.787 --> 36:13.422
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:13.455 --> 36:15.824
FRUSTRATED AND COMPLETELY
OVERWHELMED...

36:15.857 --> 36:16.848
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

36:16.848 --> 36:18.093
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

36:18.126 --> 36:20.429
LEX LEAVES THE KITCHEN
TO GO COOL OFF OUTSIDE.

36:20.462 --> 36:21.663
LEX, COME BACK HERE.

36:21.697 --> 36:24.232
LEX IS PANICKING ON US.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.268
MEANWHILE, LELA IS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING ROOM

36:26.301 --> 36:27.602
FIELDING COMPLAINTS.

36:27.636 --> 36:29.538
YOU'RE WAITING
FOR GRILLED SALMON?

36:29.571 --> 36:31.807
YEAH.
OKAY, LET ME GO SEE
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.175
WHERE'S LEX?

36:33.208 --> 36:34.810
THEY'RE WAITING OUT THERE
FOR TWO SALMONS.

36:34.843 --> 36:36.545
EVERYBODY ELSE
GOT THEIR FOOD.

36:36.578 --> 36:37.879
I GUESS THERE WAS TWO UP HERE
THAT HE HAD PUT UP THERE.

36:37.913 --> 36:39.247
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

36:39.281 --> 36:40.382
THE POINT IS
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.117
ALL RIGHT.
AND I NEED
THE TWO SALMONS.

36:42.150 --> 36:43.318
WHERE'S LEX?

36:43.352 --> 36:44.686
KNOWING HOW CRITICAL

36:44.720 --> 36:45.821
TONIGHT'S DINNER SERVICE IS,

36:45.854 --> 36:46.848
LELA FINALLY BECOMES A BOSS.

36:46.848 --> 36:48.323
LELA FINALLY BECOMES A BOSS.

36:48.357 --> 36:50.292
GET IN THERE.
THERE'S TWO SALMONS.

36:50.325 --> 36:50.859
PEOPLE WAITING FOR THOSE
SALMONS.

36:50.892 --> 36:51.893
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

36:51.927 --> 36:53.395
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.296
YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

36:54.329 --> 36:55.831
THERE WAS SOMETHING
GOING ON

36:55.864 --> 36:58.033
WITH LEX AND THE BOSS, LELA.

36:58.066 --> 37:00.335
SOME WORDS WERE EXCHANGED
BECAUSE HE WANTED A BREAK,

37:00.369 --> 37:02.037
AND SHE YELLED AT HIM.

37:02.070 --> 37:04.072
I DON'T APPRECIATE
THAT KIND OF TALK.

37:04.106 --> 37:05.807
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU
TALKING TO ME THIS WAY.

37:05.841 --> 37:06.441
WELL, YOU ANSWERED ME
THAT WAY.

37:06.475 --> 37:07.943
OKAY, I ASKED YOU.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.644
YOU WERE THE ONE RAISING
YOUR VOICE TO ME FIRST.

37:09.678 --> 37:10.812
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE.

37:10.846 --> 37:11.847
YOU GUYS ARE OUT HERE.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.482
I CAN'T GET A BREAK
FOR FIVE MINUTES?

37:13.515 --> 37:15.150
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR
THE PAST FOUR HOURS STRAIGHT.

37:15.183 --> 37:16.418
EVERYBODY HAS.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

37:16.451 --> 37:16.848
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN COOKING.

37:16.848 --> 37:17.819
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN COOKING.

37:17.853 --> 37:18.820
IT'S THE SAME THING.

37:18.854 --> 37:20.389
YOURS IS NOT ANY HARDER
THAN OURS IS.

37:20.422 --> 37:22.224
YOU'RE NOT WORKING
IN THE HEAT LIKE I AM.

37:22.257 --> 37:24.092
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE IT, THEN LEAVE.

37:24.126 --> 37:28.330
SHE TOTALLY SNAPPED.
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS KIDDING.

37:28.363 --> 37:29.998
NO, SHE WAS--
SHE WAS SERIOUS.

37:30.032 --> 37:31.333
I'M TIRED OF THESE PEOPLE
NOT DOING

37:31.366 --> 37:32.601
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

37:32.634 --> 37:33.602
THEY JUST GET UP AND WALK OUT

37:33.635 --> 37:34.903
WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT.

37:34.936 --> 37:36.304
AND I'M NOT GONNA DEAL
WITH THAT ANYMORE.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.807
LEX!

37:38.840 --> 37:40.142
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.010
SHE'S JUST REALLY
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

37:42.044 --> 37:43.779
LIKE, I'M TRYING TO TAKE
A FIVE MINUTE BREAK AT LEAST.

37:43.812 --> 37:45.580
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHEN
I GOT UPSET.

37:45.614 --> 37:46.848
LIKE, WHAT THE HELL?
I'VE BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT.

37:46.848 --> 37:46.882
LIKE, WHAT THE HELL?
I'VE BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT.

37:46.915 --> 37:48.216
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING
ARE YOU?

37:48.250 --> 37:49.184
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?
