WEBVTT

00:03.160 --> 00:05.850
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.

00:05.850 --> 00:08.500
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there

00:09.250 --> 00:12.000
you might not want the wrong people
knowing that Jericho is still here.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.430
The unfortunate truth is, there was another
explosion in Atlanta.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.940
--So, do we have a plan?
--I will talk to April.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.100
--Tonight.
--Secrets of a small town.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.760
--Divorce papers.
--I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.001
I don't want it.

00:32.787 --> 00:33.963
The train that never showed up--

00:34.350 --> 00:35.149
smashed into a car.

00:35.147 --> 00:37.048
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.

00:44.923 --> 00:47.544
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.

00:49.746 --> 00:50.520
Hello.

00:50.536 --> 00:54.080
This Assistant Secretary Walsh from
the Department of Homeland Security.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.133
Stay where you are.

00:55.337 --> 00:56.541
Do not attempt to leave.

00:58.705 --> 00:59.403
What's going on?

00:59.405 --> 01:01.111
All right, everybody calm down, all right?

01:01.116 --> 01:02.701
We'll have it back in a second.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.366 --> 01:29.532
Are those ours or theirs?

01:30.246 --> 01:31.242
They're headed up.

01:31.248 --> 01:32.520
They must be ours.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.722
Nearest missile silo's
in Wyoming, 100 miles away.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.193
So this is it?

01:42.706 --> 01:44.001
We're at war?

02:14.538 --> 02:15.292
Dad?

02:15.956 --> 02:18.882
Hey, I want you to get your mom
and Samuel down here

02:18.885 --> 02:20.471
and you wait for me until I come out.

02:22.235 --> 02:24.690
--What are you...
--No, now, baby, now.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.612
Well, if we're sending missiles,

02:27.615 --> 02:30.573
--they must have figured out who attacked us.
--God bless America.

02:30.577 --> 02:32.912
Could have just decided to take
out one of the usual suspects.

02:32.916 --> 02:35.213
Which means there could be
more missiles headed in our direction.

02:35.218 --> 02:38.960
Well, is this the federal response
we've all been waiting for?

03:09.226 --> 03:11.923
--Robert, the circuit breaker
--Wasn't the breaker.

03:12.155 --> 03:13.213
It was an EMP.

03:14.158 --> 03:15.902
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

03:17.038 --> 03:19.182
Fries anything with a circuit board.

03:19.185 --> 03:23.853
That means all electronics,
appliances, anything with wires.

03:24.428 --> 03:26.913
Does that mean another bomb
has gone off somewhere?

03:41.168 --> 03:43.432
--What the hell was that?
--It was an EMP.

03:43.436 --> 03:45.931
--Everything's dead.
--Well, is help on its way or not?

03:47.408 --> 03:48.691
I don't think so.

04:29.118 --> 04:30.570
Hey. Slow down.

04:30.885 --> 04:32.362
What's the matter with you, huh?

04:32.908 --> 04:34.102
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.580
Dale, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:36.637 --> 04:38.942
--What are you doing?
--He broke our window, you saw him.

04:39.786 --> 04:41.691
--Hey!
--Dale.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.701
--Thanks a lot.
--Dale, hold up.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.121
--What?
--You all right?

04:48.465 --> 04:52.641
--They tried to break into
the store twice this week.
--Oh, that's terrible.

04:52.937 --> 04:54.802
--You got a problem?
--Not me.

04:55.106 --> 04:57.871
Dale's my buddy. Right, Dale?

05:07.296 --> 05:09.030
You can't go around shoving
people in the street, all right?

05:09.036 --> 05:11.282
If you got a problem, you take
it up with Jimmy or Bill.

05:11.286 --> 05:13.801
--All they'll do is write a report.
--All right, well, then, come to me.

05:14.668 --> 05:15.830
I can take care of myself.

05:23.517 --> 05:25.142
There's got to be an easier way.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.030
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine
to work with the hand crank or something?

05:29.766 --> 05:30.851
I'll be back tonight.

05:31.757 --> 05:32.950
Where are you going, Dad?

05:33.495 --> 05:34.830
To the station.

05:35.017 --> 05:36.211
So why you heading off to play cop?

05:36.216 --> 05:40.333
Because people are starting to react to the fact
that no one is coming to save them.

05:40.578 --> 05:41.741
Okay? No one.

05:42.838 --> 05:46.181
Because the world we knew
does not exist anymore.

05:46.788 --> 05:48.232
So if we can't keep order

05:48.968 --> 05:50.400
we will not survive.

05:55.805 --> 05:57.592
Alison, give me a minute with your father.

05:57.896 --> 05:59.263
--Mom, I just...
--Now.

06:04.666 --> 06:07.591
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about
the end of the world, Robert?

06:07.597 --> 06:09.051
Well, they have to understand
what's going on.

06:09.095 --> 06:11.370
You haven't been around for four years.

06:12.418 --> 06:16.542
I'm the parent here, okay?
I'll decide what they need.

06:22.266 --> 06:23.703
We cannot have photos up.

06:23.835 --> 06:26.203
They might raise questions about us as a family.

06:26.396 --> 06:27.681
I'm not in this.

06:29.677 --> 06:31.072
Get rid of them, Darcy.

06:33.975 --> 06:35.840
People are trespassing on my land.

06:35.845 --> 06:38.191
Well, we don't have the resources
to control the whole town, Carla.

06:38.386 --> 06:39.733
You have to keep an eye
on your own properties.

06:39.735 --> 06:41.542
Our street's got a busted water main.

06:41.547 --> 06:43.010
My whole front lawn is flooded.

06:43.017 --> 06:45.331
--I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
--Where's Mayor Green?

06:46.216 --> 06:48.310
He is home recuperating from the flu.

06:48.495 --> 06:52.331
--Then who's running this town?
--The mayor is still in charge

06:52.338 --> 06:55.342
and, you know, these guys are doing
the best job they can with a short staff.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.383
Who the hell are you?

06:56.558 --> 06:58.851
He is a volunteer and a deputy.

06:59.785 --> 07:01.470
Now settle down and we'll get to you.

07:01.475 --> 07:03.222
But you have to be patient.

07:05.297 --> 07:06.121
Please.

07:07.997 --> 07:08.850
How's your brother?

07:09.946 --> 07:11.772
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.

07:12.048 --> 07:15.852
--Spends a lot of time at work
making sure the town stays on its feet.
--Really?

07:16.845 --> 07:17.623
That's odd.

07:18.635 --> 07:21.402
I just figured he'd be spending
a little more time with his wife.

07:21.588 --> 07:24.120
You know, now that they've
lost the house and all.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.940
They  seem pretty happy together.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.173
Mitchell, wait up.

07:30.385 --> 07:32.641
--Looking good, Mary.
--Uh-uh.

07:32.648 --> 07:34.210
We are not doing this again, Mitch.

07:34.405 --> 07:35.411
You're not welcome here.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.152
Oh, come on, with everything that's happened

07:37.418 --> 07:38.672
I'm just looking for a cold beer.

07:38.676 --> 07:41.270
Well, we haven't served
cold anything in a long time.

07:41.275 --> 07:42.902
All  right, just give me whatever you got.

07:45.037 --> 07:46.390
Or I'll get it myself.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.301
You might want to rethink that.

07:53.485 --> 07:54.903
Wow.

07:56.348 --> 07:58.452
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.

08:00.816 --> 08:02.600
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.

08:05.108 --> 08:07.403
Oh, come on, let's not do it like this.

08:08.345 --> 08:11.462
Besides, anyone should have a grudge,
it's me, right?

08:11.848 --> 08:13.701
I mean, you left me holding
the bad when you blew town.

08:13.897 --> 08:15.060
You know what, you're right.

08:16.048 --> 08:17.682
Don't make me kick your ass again.

08:18.328 --> 08:19.101
Hey.

08:20.135 --> 08:21.382
Is everything all right?

08:23.887 --> 08:26.022
You  travel with your own personal bodyguard now?

08:26.996 --> 08:28.392
That's probably not a bad idea.

08:28.398 --> 08:30.421
--What's the trouble here?
--Oh, no trouble.

08:30.807 --> 08:33.063
We're just two old friends catching up.

08:33.908 --> 08:36.052
Well, maybe you should
do that some other place.

08:37.346 --> 08:38.522
And some other time.

08:43.668 --> 08:44.751
See you soon.

08:58.986 --> 09:00.212
--Hey, Mom.
--Hi.

09:00.588 --> 09:01.433
What are you doing home?

09:01.668 --> 09:03.952
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.

09:03.955 --> 09:07.252
Taken more complaints these last few
days than we normally do in a month.

09:07.257 --> 09:10.202
Well, Jake and I are going out to the ranch
to feed the horses in a little bit.

09:10.207 --> 09:13.603
--If you'd like to join us,
maybe we could talk.
--I'm sorry, I can't.

09:13.605 --> 09:17.290
With Dad down, I'm struggling just to make sure
things don't fall apart out there.

09:18.496 --> 09:19.970
How 'bout things closer to home?

09:21.815 --> 09:23.092
What's that supposed to mean?

09:23.217 --> 09:24.693
How are you and April doing?

09:24.938 --> 09:26.642
Why, did she say something?

09:27.078 --> 09:28.123
Eric...

09:30.356 --> 09:33.192
--How's Johnston?
--I wish I had better news.

09:34.278 --> 09:35.843
His fever's getting worse.

09:36.338 --> 09:39.181
I'll try to dig up a stronger
course of antibiotics at the med center

09:39.180 --> 09:41.879
but we're running low on supplies.

09:41.877 --> 09:44.168
God, if I could just get him to eat something.

09:45.213 --> 09:47.704
--Can you stay?
--Don't worry about me, Mom.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.413
There's a box protein bars at the station.

09:49.418 --> 09:51.783
--I'll just grab one of those.
--Okay.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.511
If you wait ten minutes

09:55.717 --> 09:58.771
--maybe we could walk together?
--I got to go.

09:58.775 --> 10:00.043
There's an important meeting.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.820
Then that's where you should be.

10:03.647 --> 10:04.932
We'll talk tonight.

10:16.627 --> 10:18.333
Maybe we can put in a new starter.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.501
No one can find a starter that works.

10:23.775 --> 10:24.850
Uncle Sam!

10:25.568 --> 10:28.632
--To what do we owe the pleasure?
--Can you please not call me that?

10:31.457 --> 10:34.603
--What did she say?
--Oh, she says she likes your shoes.

10:35.237 --> 10:36.172
Thank you.

10:38.525 --> 10:39.881
I have a proposition.

10:40.666 --> 10:42.791
The hotel I was staying in closed

10:42.796 --> 10:48.363
--and since you owe the government
more than... $180,000...
--No one's heard from the government in weeks.

10:48.365 --> 10:49.870
Consider me the government.

10:49.937 --> 10:52.022
Fine, then I still get to call you Uncle Sam.

10:53.655 --> 10:54.902
Nice watch.

10:55.256 --> 10:56.623
It's a Rolex.

10:57.827 --> 11:00.643
--You got the time?
--It's, um...

11:01.646 --> 11:05.341
It just stopped working after the pulse, just
like everyone else's.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.673
Well, I how about I pay you
when it starts up again?

11:08.518 --> 11:09.791
You're being an idiot.

11:10.228 --> 11:13.442
I am trying to give you a chance
to protect your interests.

11:13.938 --> 11:14.832
You're too kind.

11:15.195 --> 11:16.303
Hey, here's the deal.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.541
You let me stay here,

11:17.758 --> 11:21.413
and I will deduct my room and board
from what you owe the IRS.

11:22.535 --> 11:23.803
Fine, fine, why not?

11:23.806 --> 11:25.183
I can use an extra field hand

11:25.188 --> 11:27.233
and you can help Bonnie with
the cooking and the washing.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.881
Okay, maybe you don't understand
the nature of a deal.

11:30.105 --> 11:31.542
I don't do housework.

11:33.178 --> 11:35.081
Oh! Is that a cockroach?

11:35.266 --> 11:38.383
--We don't have cockroaches here.
--Well, it landed right on me!

11:38.388 --> 11:41.441
It's probably attracted to all
that chicken crap in the yard.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.553
Stanley, what's wrong?

11:58.857 --> 11:59.981
What do you got there?

12:00.538 --> 12:02.182
Rap sheet on Mitchell Cafferty.

12:02.278 --> 12:05.410
Armed robbery, assault, gun-trafficking.

12:06.697 --> 12:09.580
Yeah. Mitch isn't one of Jericho's finest.

12:10.347 --> 12:11.512
What do you know about him?

12:12.027 --> 12:14.122
Well, he hasn't given us trouble in a while.

12:14.386 --> 12:17.133
He stays on the edge of town in a sort
of compound with a bunch of guys.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.570
--Like survivalists?
--I guess.

12:20.428 --> 12:21.781
Why are you so interested?

12:22.098 --> 12:24.003
Well, he was in Bailey's this morning.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.091
Had some words with your brother.

12:26.687 --> 12:28.403
Looked like there was a bit of history there.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.503
What did Jake do about it?

12:31.038 --> 12:34.073
Kept his cool, didn't engage.

12:35.478 --> 12:37.310
Well, it's best we leave it alone, then.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.532
Like you said, it's history.

12:42.467 --> 12:45.231
Well, one thing that hasn't changed...

12:45.538 --> 12:46.580
all this.

12:48.427 --> 12:50.793
You remember when you first started riding?

12:51.796 --> 12:54.010
Took to it like a fish to water.

12:54.326 --> 12:56.461
You know, if you'd favored
your father a little less

12:56.466 --> 12:58.392
and your dinky Uncle Dennis a little more

12:58.396 --> 13:00.413
you would've been a hell of a jockey.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.833
Talk to me.

13:03.446 --> 13:05.392
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.773
--You okay?
--Yeah, just tired.

13:10.068 --> 13:11.160
I'm gonna get the water.

13:31.048 --> 13:32.362
Mom! Stay down!

13:36.628 --> 13:40.011
--Hyah! Hyah!
--Who are those guys?

13:41.558 --> 13:43.002
--Hyah!
--Hyah!

13:51.135 --> 13:52.803
I can't believe it's not broken

13:53.507 --> 13:55.723
I'll get you some aspirin
for the pain and swelling.

13:55.725 --> 13:57.970
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.

13:58.155 --> 13:59.271
I-It's okay, honey.

13:59.605 --> 14:03.051
--I don't need anything else.
--Don't argue with her, Gail--
doctor's orders.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.882
Damn bastards.

14:05.126 --> 14:07.883
--Jake?
--Where are you going?

14:08.038 --> 14:09.861
--To find Mitch.
--And then what?

14:10.207 --> 14:11.273
I don't know yet.

14:11.277 --> 14:14.263
--Well, hold on, Jake, you don't know
for sure if he's behind this.
--It was him.

14:14.265 --> 14:17.240
--You said yourself you didn't get a good look.
--Now, look...

14:18.407 --> 14:21.610
you know, I would like nothing better
than to string up the guys who did this

14:21.618 --> 14:23.702
but that's not the way we do things.

14:23.707 --> 14:25.633
Last time you got mixed up
with Mitch Cafferty

14:25.638 --> 14:29.392
--you left town and a boy was dead.
--I'm not that guy anymore.
--Yeah?

14:30.865 --> 14:33.273
Let's just make sure
that it stays that way.

14:35.137 --> 14:37.573
Look, if I don't care of him,
he'll come back.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.930
--We've got to do this right.
--You know that...

14:39.127 --> 14:42.863
If this family starts breaking the law,
how are we supposed to enforce it?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.770
Gracie, you still have
those crop pesticides?

14:58.086 --> 15:01.313
--Everything I got left is right there
on that shelf.
--Thank God.

15:01.315 --> 15:03.500
I'm gonna need everything
you got to protect my corn.

15:03.508 --> 15:05.271
Can anyone even eat that corn?

15:05.458 --> 15:09.491
--What about that rain we had?
--No, it's okay.
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.

15:09.677 --> 15:13.383
--It was already mature, so the ears didn't
take up any of that moisture.
--You sure about that?

15:13.385 --> 15:16.651
Gracie, you think I'd let
my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?

15:17.075 --> 15:17.892
You think I would?

15:18.046 --> 15:19.752
After what I've been exposed to?

15:19.977 --> 15:22.390
I'll give you 20 bushels
for those pesticides.

15:23.976 --> 15:28.061
Well, I was thinking we'd split
the harvest, half and half.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.490
Half? What are you, crazy?

15:31.755 --> 15:33.891
Well, how you gonna sell your corn?

15:34.168 --> 15:35.792
Give it to me, I'll sell it here

15:35.796 --> 15:37.463
and we'll share the profit.

15:37.715 --> 15:40.012
Richmond farm belongs to the U.S. Treasury.

15:40.017 --> 15:44.150
--You're lucky we just don't
commandeer what we need.
--I'd like to see you try.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.910
All right, let's go.

16:02.416 --> 16:03.552
Hey, Mary.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.162
Where the hell have you been?

16:06.745 --> 16:09.580
We think Mitch Cafferty and his cohorts
stole some horses.

16:10.047 --> 16:11.271
I know they were here earlier;

16:11.276 --> 16:13.243
I thought maybe you might
have heard something.

16:14.727 --> 16:16.983
Anything you might know, Mary,
would really help.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.150
There was a man here this afternoon.

16:20.156 --> 16:26.671
--I heard him say that he bought a horse
from some guys out at the airfield.
--The airfield. All right. Thanks.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.572
Thanks.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.182
Eric.

16:32.788 --> 16:34.180
The last time I saw you,

16:34.185 --> 16:37.443
you were gonna tell your wife about us
and we were gonna start our life together.

16:37.737 --> 16:39.683
That thought has kept me going.

16:40.147 --> 16:41.712
That was nearly two weeks ago.

16:42.206 --> 16:43.022
I  don't know...

16:43.378 --> 16:45.211
what you're thinking,
I don't know if you're okay.

16:45.216 --> 16:47.150
I don't know if I'm okay, Mary.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.531
I know this is not what I wanted.

16:51.776 --> 16:56.212
Mary, I think about you every minute
of every day.

16:56.217 --> 16:57.580
Man, I wake up in the morning

16:57.585 --> 17:00.141
and I want it to be you there so badly.

17:02.478 --> 17:03.520
I know I...

17:03.727 --> 17:04.819
I'm still married,

17:04.827 --> 17:05.980
and I have a wife,

17:06.058 --> 17:07.242
and I owe her...

17:09.185 --> 17:10.151
something.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.143
I  don't know what to say, Mary.

17:13.147 --> 17:15.042
I wish I did, but I don't.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.723
It's like a damn infirmary in here.

17:52.726 --> 17:55.460
Thought it'd be at least
20 years before it came to this.

17:55.665 --> 17:57.221
--All right.
--I'm hot!

17:57.957 --> 18:00.953
Yeah. I'll bet you didn't expect
a house full of kids, either.

18:06.948 --> 18:09.522
I'm worried about Jake.

18:10.697 --> 18:11.741
So am I.

18:14.495 --> 18:17.061
I don't think I'll ever forget
the night I got that call.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.570
Went out there and saw that
Mitch Cafferty in handcuffs

18:20.576 --> 18:22.110
that other kid all covered in blood

18:22.117 --> 18:23.430
and all I could think is...

18:24.838 --> 18:27.061
...one of those boys
could've been Jake.

18:31.365 --> 18:33.420
--Oh, hi, Stanley.
--Hi.

18:33.848 --> 18:35.413
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Green, Mayor,

18:35.416 --> 18:39.213
--but I, uh... I need to talk to you.
--What is it?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.523
I found corn worms in my crop...

18:43.416 --> 18:44.682
and I know this is a long shot,

18:44.687 --> 18:47.280
but I was hoping maybe you'd have
some pesticides out at your ranch.

18:47.287 --> 18:51.173
None of the other farms can spare 'em.
Sorry, Stanley. Have you tried Gracie's?

18:52.058 --> 18:54.391
Yeah. She-she won't give 'em up.

18:55.596 --> 18:57.451
You see, I need to kill these bugs,

18:58.078 --> 19:00.953
or I'd have to harvest what's good today,
or it's-it's all gone.

19:01.257 --> 19:03.893
Does she realize you have
the biggest farm in Jericho?

19:03.897 --> 19:06.963
I mean, if we lose his crops, we all starve.

19:06.966 --> 19:09.510
We're just gonna have to put together
a crew as quick as we can

19:09.967 --> 19:13.083
--and we'll have to figure out
how to ration it.
--Hang on a minute.

19:14.475 --> 19:16.830
--This is my corn.
--Well, of course it is, Stanley--

19:16.835 --> 19:18.511
it's just right now we need you to share.

19:18.516 --> 19:20.873
I mean, we're on our own here, and
the town's nearly out of food.

19:20.876 --> 19:24.871
Well, now, I'm willing to do my part, Mayor,
but I'm not giving up my crop.

19:24.878 --> 19:25.893
Stanley,

19:26.126 --> 19:28.620
there'll be plenty enough for you and Bonnie.

19:28.627 --> 19:33.401
--Plenty enough for everyone.
--For 5,000 people plus livestock
for God knows how many months?

19:35.735 --> 19:38.561
I am not the only farm in this town.
Why am I being targeted?

19:38.566 --> 19:41.461
--Stanley, nobody's being targeted.
-- It sure doesn't seem that way, sir--

19:41.465 --> 19:44.841
all of a sudden everybody's laying claim
to my crop-- the IRS, Gracie, and now you.

19:44.846 --> 19:49.160
--Stanley, we're just...
--All due respect, I'll take care of it myself.

19:49.168 --> 19:52.893
--Oh, Stanley, come and sit down, honey.
--Stanley, come on back here, now.

20:13.398 --> 20:14.361
Hey, girl.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.182
Jake.

20:23.237 --> 20:24.820
Dale, what are you doing here?

20:25.338 --> 20:27.400
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

20:27.556 --> 20:29.570
--Didn't know what?
--Jake!

20:43.147 --> 20:44.110
Jake?

20:44.456 --> 20:45.782
You back away.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.601
--Get the hell out of here, Dale.
--No.

20:50.758 --> 20:51.920
Stick around--

20:52.378 --> 20:54.170
think of this as initiation.

20:55.995 --> 20:58.670
--You've crossed the line.
--Excuse me?

20:59.455 --> 21:00.660
You heard me.

21:01.445 --> 21:03.663
Coming to our family's ranch.

21:06.227 --> 21:07.353
I crossed the line?

21:08.098 --> 21:09.341
I went to jail...

21:10.708 --> 21:12.811
that night that you bailed on us.

21:13.158 --> 21:14.752
My best friend...

21:15.687 --> 21:18.643
--had  half of his head blown off.
--I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.081
Oh, come on, stop acting like an angel.

21:21.326 --> 21:23.663
You come back to... settle down?

21:24.938 --> 21:27.271
Raise a family, maybe do a little farming?

21:27.278 --> 21:29.960
--I never planned on staying.
--Of course not.

21:30.768 --> 21:31.931
But where you gonna go?

21:33.175 --> 21:34.381
Cars don't work.

21:34.616 --> 21:36.223
We're fresh out of horses.

21:36.235 --> 21:37.213
If you...

21:37.567 --> 21:40.672
or anybody ever come near my family again

21:41.257 --> 21:43.002
I will kill you.

21:47.437 --> 21:48.913
Now, that's the Jake I know.

21:55.028 --> 21:56.230
All right, now get up.

21:56.488 --> 21:58.122
I'm taking you to go see John.

22:28.978 --> 22:30.031
Don't even move.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.293
--Where's Mitchell?
--Don't know.

22:43.218 --> 22:45.791
I know you, Sean.
You're lying.

22:46.718 --> 22:48.270
Dale?

22:48.375 --> 22:49.553
You're next.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.431
What am I gonna do about this?

22:56.785 --> 22:57.872
Can't charge them with anything

22:57.875 --> 22:59.412
and the nearest judge is in the county seat

22:59.417 --> 23:01.580
and we don't even know if that exists
anymore.

23:02.196 --> 23:05.290
Is this about these kids?
Or Mitchell Cafferty?

23:07.495 --> 23:09.720
He stole my mother's horses
and he could have gotten her killed.

23:09.725 --> 23:12.823
Oh, you had run-ins with this
guy long before that, Jake.

23:13.986 --> 23:15.271
I've read his file.

23:15.545 --> 23:17.733
--He's gonna be a problem, right?
--Yeah.

23:18.775 --> 23:21.060
And now with the sheriff
and half our deputies dead

23:21.066 --> 23:24.341
Mitchell and his kind are gonna
prey on this town like locusts.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.871
--We need to stop them now.
--Well, if it's information you want

23:29.608 --> 23:34.271
--first thing we do is separate them.
--All right, I'll take Sean into the hallway.
--No.

23:35.016 --> 23:35.992
I'll do it.

23:46.638 --> 23:48.620
Get up. We're v

23:48.628 --> 23:51.882
Screw that, I don't have to...
Ow. Ow.

23:52.146 --> 23:53.013
Walk.

24:04.537 --> 24:07.021
Some pesticides got stolen over at Gracie's.

24:07.025 --> 24:08.451
Do you know anything about it?

24:09.346 --> 24:12.262
No. I mean, I was there earlier
trying to buy some, but...

24:12.757 --> 24:13.800
But what?

24:17.547 --> 24:20.352
All right. What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?

24:22.258 --> 24:24.003
Gracie came down to the station.

24:24.466 --> 24:26.482
Started raising all kinds of hell.

24:27.687 --> 24:30.793
--She says you stole 'em.
--She told you I stole them?

24:32.158 --> 24:33.413
You mind if I take a look around?

24:33.417 --> 24:36.822
--Yeah, I do, Bill. This is nuts!
--What's going on?

24:37.447 --> 24:38.490
I don't know.

24:39.068 --> 24:42.290
One of my best friends is accusing me
of stealing pesticides.

24:43.685 --> 24:44.822
I'm gonna check the barn.

24:46.378 --> 24:47.840
I didn't say you could go in there.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.001
Watch it.

24:49.517 --> 24:51.963
--It's okay.
--Just let him do what he wants to do.

24:54.998 --> 24:56.233
Fine, check the barn.

24:57.445 --> 24:59.152
Check the whole damn house!

25:05.176 --> 25:08.462
...how you got mixed up with Mitchell
but you need tostay away from him.

25:09.037 --> 25:12.032
--I'm serious.
--You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.

25:12.776 --> 25:15.141
How did you get mixed up with him?

25:15.918 --> 25:17.390
I was stupid.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.090
And bored and looking for trouble.

25:22.095 --> 25:23.382
Are you lookinfor trouble?

25:23.925 --> 25:24.823
Dale.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.481
--Why are they keeping you here?
--What'd you do?

25:27.828 --> 25:29.263
I'm just talking to him.

25:29.816 --> 25:31.321
You can't without an attorney.

25:31.325 --> 25:33.663
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.301
I know the machines are down,
but you have to take it.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.540
Get out of here.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.631
--You're letting me go?
--Yeah.

25:45.815 --> 25:47.993
Just trying to talk some sense into you.

25:49.106 --> 25:52.451
Believe me, you don't want
to go down this road.

25:58.988 --> 26:00.731
I think I know where Mitchell is.

26:02.045 --> 26:02.982
I'll show you.

26:06.417 --> 26:07.191
Dad?

26:14.395 --> 26:15.142
Dad?

26:27.456 --> 26:28.463
Dad?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.230
Come on, out of here.

27:30.655 --> 27:31.470
Hey!

27:32.175 --> 27:33.880
Are all those cities gone?

27:36.267 --> 27:37.280
What do you think?

27:41.565 --> 27:44.011
--How do you know?
--I don't for sure.

27:46.588 --> 27:47.471
Okay.

27:52.255 --> 27:55.330
--Those are the cities
--I heard about through the HAM radio

27:56.027 --> 27:58.391
and the satellite feed before the EMP.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.442
--Home come your laptop wasn't
fried like everything else?
--It's ruggedized.

28:02.446 --> 28:05.080
It is built to withstand an EMP.

28:05.786 --> 28:06.912
The, um...

28:09.525 --> 28:11.590
The government issues them, baby.

28:13.657 --> 28:15.281
So you're some kind of spy?

28:18.406 --> 28:19.841
That's why you moved us here.

28:20.047 --> 28:21.590
You knew this was gonna happen.

28:23.986 --> 28:26.162
Why do you have that gun? What's it for?

28:26.295 --> 28:27.270
Shooting.

28:30.087 --> 28:32.930
And I think it's probably
time you learned how.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.053
You see, the way things are going...

28:36.415 --> 28:38.512
you may have to defend yourself one day.

28:39.448 --> 28:40.571
Do you understand?

28:41.418 --> 28:42.650
Hey, what's going on?

28:43.317 --> 28:46.153
We were just catching up.
Right?

29:03.138 --> 29:04.143
You're clear.

29:04.806 --> 29:05.583
Are you sure?

29:05.587 --> 29:07.681
--Because we can check the fields.
--We can go through them row by row.

29:07.685 --> 29:10.530
--We got a complaint.
--So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?

29:10.538 --> 29:11.691
--Stanley.
--No.

29:14.528 --> 29:16.053
What about my word, Bill?

29:16.435 --> 29:18.142
I'm just doing my job, man.

29:29.956 --> 29:32.241
-- What are you doing?
--I'm gonna burn the field.

29:32.246 --> 29:34.512
You've completely lost your mind.

29:34.515 --> 29:37.522
--What happened to you?
--I'm not gonna burn the whole field,
just the infested parts.

29:37.528 --> 29:39.613
Oh, my God, Stanley.

29:39.616 --> 29:41.321
You don't need to do this.

29:41.325 --> 29:45.432
--Look, it's the only thing I can think of.
--I got the pesticides.

29:45.746 --> 29:47.191
What are you talking about?

29:47.295 --> 29:49.763
I paid some kids to steal them
from Gracie's store.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.050
We just have to get into town
and pick them up.

29:53.465 --> 29:56.853
--You stole the pesticides?
--What, am I talking to myself?

29:56.855 --> 29:59.651
I paid someone to steal them.

30:00.935 --> 30:02.530
I gave them my diamond watch.

30:04.127 --> 30:05.910
I can't believe this is what we've come to.

30:06.147 --> 30:08.282
We don't really have a choice, Stanley.

30:09.176 --> 30:10.802
It's every man for himself now.

30:30.627 --> 30:33.071
--He's finally asleep.
--Great.

30:34.236 --> 30:36.811
--How are you feeling?
--Oh...

30:37.748 --> 30:39.221
I'm hanging in there.

30:42.538 --> 30:45.170
I'm sorry there isn't more
I can do for him.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.581
That's one obstinate guy in there.

30:50.025 --> 30:52.711
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from
the tree.

30:52.716 --> 30:55.623
Certainly not as far as Jake's concerned.

30:57.258 --> 31:00.872
I don't know as I've ever really thought
of Eric as being stubborn.

31:02.148 --> 31:04.052
Hard to reach, then?

31:05.347 --> 31:07.870
Well, he's had a lot on his plate.

31:08.176 --> 31:09.621
since the missiles...

31:10.296 --> 31:14.003
--not to mention your new living arrangement.
--Yeah.

31:15.636 --> 31:18.001
It started long before all of this.

31:20.765 --> 31:22.240
I've been where you are.

31:25.908 --> 31:28.472
Putting something back together...

31:29.947 --> 31:31.493
isn't ever easy.

31:33.835 --> 31:36.521
But somebody's got to take the first step.

31:37.217 --> 31:39.160
Now, if you want to fight for this thing

31:39.475 --> 31:41.020
start fighting.

31:44.297 --> 31:46.302
You need to be smarter about who you
hang out with.

31:46.308 --> 31:47.782
I don't hang out with those guys.

31:47.788 --> 31:50.341
I needed Sean and Mitch to help me
move some stuff, that's all.

31:51.046 --> 31:54.080
--I didn't know about the horses.
--Well, what did you think, Dale?

31:54.087 --> 31:58.490
--Hey, you never should
have tried to protect them.
--I wasn't. I was trying to protect Gracie.

31:58.777 --> 31:59.532
What do you mean?

31:59.885 --> 32:02.373
A train crashed full of food supplies.

32:03.696 --> 32:04.961
It's how I've been keeping Gracie stocked.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.940
I didn't want anyone to know about it.

32:10.517 --> 32:12.180
It's all in there.

32:26.876 --> 32:27.640
What?

32:27.837 --> 32:30.360
This place was full.
It was stacked to the rafters.

32:32.468 --> 32:34.053
I guess we know who took it.

32:38.227 --> 32:39.042
Gracie.

32:39.287 --> 32:40.841
You get the hell out of my store.

32:40.848 --> 32:44.573
--I know you stole from me.
--No, I didn't, Gracie. I swear I didn't.

32:45.608 --> 32:47.231
Gracie, how long have you known me?

32:47.858 --> 32:49.081
My whole life, right?

32:49.088 --> 32:50.871
We have to trust each other.

32:51.257 --> 32:52.730
Just, just, let me show you.

32:53.687 --> 32:54.690
Follow me.

33:00.735 --> 33:02.873
You see, Gracie?
It's all here.

33:03.526 --> 33:06.171
Nobody stole anything from anyone, okay?

33:06.176 --> 33:08.001
It was a misunderstanding.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.821
--Do you have any idea where he would
have moved it to?
-No, no, I don't.
--Shh.

33:14.987 --> 33:16.151
Eric.

33:24.886 --> 33:26.233
You stay here.

33:35.518 --> 33:37.252
Stop right there, Mitchell!

33:38.378 --> 33:39.390
Put your gun down.

33:40.445 --> 33:42.083
Put your gun down!

33:46.487 --> 33:47.960
Now put your hands up.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.233
Where's the food?

34:01.528 --> 34:03.563
Jake... stop.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.510
What are you doing? I said, "stop."

34:05.926 --> 34:07.470
Where's the food?

34:07.978 --> 34:08.952
Stop!

34:14.514 --> 34:16.621
So what are we going to do about him?

34:16.886 --> 34:18.330
We lock him up for now.

34:19.007 --> 34:22.063
Maybe we can send someone to Fielding,
see if the courthouse is still running.

34:22.065 --> 34:24.672
--His friends aren't going to let this go.
--I can handle it.

34:24.676 --> 34:27.313
--Yeah, you handled it real good back at the barn.
--I should have killed him.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.980
Stop it, Jake!

34:29.266 --> 34:31.280
You're not that guy anymore.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.413
What about these two?

34:36.817 --> 34:38.402
Now I can see letting Dale go,

34:38.405 --> 34:41.973
--but Sean helped steal the horses.
--He's still a boy.

34:41.976 --> 34:45.052
--A boy who could have gotten you killed, Mom.
--Well, it doesn't matter, Eric,

34:45.056 --> 34:47.193
because I'm not pressing charges.

34:47.848 --> 34:51.811
This cell is too small to hold
everybody who ever made a mistake.

34:54.955 --> 34:56.172
What do you suggest?

35:00.268 --> 35:01.820
Rehabilitation.

35:07.077 --> 35:08.013
Okay.

35:08.576 --> 35:10.003
Okay, hold it.

35:10.587 --> 35:11.772
All fingers wrapped.

35:11.775 --> 35:13.170
Okay, relax.

35:13.397 --> 35:14.220
Right.

35:14.778 --> 35:17.660
It's okay. Breathe. Nice.

35:17.665 --> 35:18.932
Stand with your legs like so.

35:19.128 --> 35:21.601
--A little further apart.
--Right.

35:21.608 --> 35:22.692
Now bend your knees,

35:23.508 --> 35:24.673
take your sight.

35:25.226 --> 35:26.780
Try to keep your eyes open.

35:29.266 --> 35:30.353
Squeeze.

35:33.897 --> 35:37.413
Good job, good job. All right.

35:38.747 --> 35:40.100
That's a very good job.

35:41.237 --> 35:42.282
You like that?

35:47.626 --> 35:50.822
--Are you sure this is going to work?
--In theory.

35:51.127 --> 35:54.160
--You've never done this before?
--Nope.

35:54.857 --> 35:56.840
Well, don't get it on your shoes.

35:57.768 --> 36:02.851
--Seriously, get away from me.
--Oh, my God, I wish I prayed.
--Stanley.

36:11.697 --> 36:13.683
You said you needed to harvest today.

36:15.855 --> 36:19.020
We're here to help, no strings attached.

36:19.728 --> 36:23.573
(In a world full of pretty things)

36:24.038 --> 36:27.613
(You carry out only what you bring in)

36:28.368 --> 36:30.030
(Now square your shoulders,)

36:30.185 --> 36:31.703
(lift your pack)

36:32.258 --> 36:36.140
(And lay your feet back down on the track)

36:36.446 --> 36:40.680
(This is the part where you
may want to give in)

36:40.837 --> 36:42.000
Thanks.

36:40.857 --> 36:44.622
(I will remind you that we both ...)

36:43.276 --> 36:44.372
Mom.

36:45.165 --> 36:47.042
Well, hello.

36:48.878 --> 36:50.660
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Green.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.973
I'm sorry for everything.

36:53.557 --> 36:55.572
All right, well, go make yourselves useful.

36:55.808 --> 36:59.433
(And tomorrow is earned)

37:09.396 --> 37:10.241
Hey.

37:12.477 --> 37:13.630
Forget it.

37:13.495 --> 37:15.061
Uncle Sam.

37:16.316 --> 37:18.021
You ever slept in a barn before?

37:19.245 --> 37:21.341
You know, it's not like
it is in the movies.

37:21.928 --> 37:26.593
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all
the pigs and goats brushing up against you.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.590
--You're bluffing.
--Try me, please.

37:40.985 --> 37:45.263
(In a stardust covered universe)

37:45.266 --> 37:51.621
(Where you will find ...)

37:46.827 --> 37:47.912
These are for you.

37:49.526 --> 37:51.393
I lost my head, Stanley.

37:51.825 --> 37:52.960
I'm sorry.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.212
Thank you.

37:57.866 --> 38:00.473
(As you travel the white line)

38:00.638 --> 38:02.572
(stripping the gears)

38:02.707 --> 38:04.611
(Eyes on the dashboard)

38:04.736 --> 38:06.753
(hands on the wheel)

38:06.836 --> 38:10.963
(Running away like you do)

38:09.655 --> 38:12.222
--Hey.
--Hey.

38:12.527 --> 38:15.713
(You've got to slow your engines...)

38:14.615 --> 38:16.450
You have any idea what you're doing?

38:17.858 --> 38:19.021
Not a clue.

38:23.515 --> 38:25.631
--Thanks for your help.
--Hey...

38:26.636 --> 38:29.771
--this is our home, too.
--Right.

38:34.587 --> 38:38.531
(Under a streetlight, I call your name)

38:37.988 --> 38:40.420
Is he a good man or a bad man?

38:38.895 --> 38:42.592
(With summer darkness, it's not that late)

38:43.685 --> 38:45.203
Baby, there's no such thing.

38:47.126 --> 38:51.011
(Then pour your future
in this cup of mine)

38:51.296 --> 38:55.303
(This is the part where you
will dig your heels in)

38:54.968 --> 38:57.732
--Kind of cool, huh?
--Yeah.

38:58.525 --> 39:00.063
Especially if you like corn.

39:00.326 --> 39:02.712
(And soon you will return)

39:03.036 --> 39:07.431
(From a stardust covered universe)

39:07.438 --> 39:14.463
(Where the end is certain,
but it will not be rehearsed.)

39:14.486 --> 39:16.880
--Hey.
--Hey.

39:18.858 --> 39:22.240
--Tough work, huh?
--Yeah.

39:22.586 --> 39:25.280
I was thinking maybe
when we leave here, we could, uh,

39:25.427 --> 39:31.103
--I was going to say go for a
walk, but we'll be too tired...
--April, stop, please. Okay?

39:31.608 --> 39:33.832
--What?
--This.

39:34.646 --> 39:35.900
What you're doing.

39:36.856 --> 39:42.383
--It's making things worse.
--I'm just trying to talk to you, get you
to look at me, something.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.651
Well, three weeks ago, you
were asking about a divorce.

39:45.736 --> 39:48.223
Three weeks ago, we lived on a different planet.

39:48.397 --> 39:49.482
Things have changed.

39:52.205 --> 39:53.733
Never mind.

39:58.848 --> 40:00.481
April, wait.

40:05.466 --> 40:07.022
There's always the walk home.

40:07.555 --> 40:10.440
Why don't we start there,
see how we feel.

41:08.698 --> 41:09.742
Jake.

41:15.075 --> 41:16.271
You ready for this?

41:20.566 --> 41:22.390
You know he's going to come for me.

41:23.087 --> 41:24.911
And then, he's going to come
looking for you.

41:25.585 --> 41:27.573
There's no running away this time, Jake.
