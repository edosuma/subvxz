00:31.031 --> 00:32.497
<i>It starts on a bridge.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:28.311
Craig!

01:31.991 --> 01:34.516
What were you
planning to do
about your bike, hon?

01:36.229 --> 01:39.460
I don't care about my bike.
I'm killing myself.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.594
But we spent
a lot of money on
the bike, sport.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.833
We only ask that
you take care of it.

01:45.905 --> 01:49.306
Think of me, Craig.
I might want that bike
when I grow up.

01:50.243 --> 01:52.040
I'm sorry.
I just didn't think it...

01:52.112 --> 01:54.080
That's right. You just
didn't think about us

01:54.147 --> 01:56.672
when you were
deciding to do this,
did you, honey?

01:56.749 --> 01:58.717
Pretty selfish,
I'd say.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.118
Have you thought
about how this might
affect your sister?

02:03.256 --> 02:05.019
I'm... I'm sorry, I...

02:11.698 --> 02:14.690
<i>This is the moment
where I usually wake up
in a sweaty panic.</i>

02:14.767 --> 02:15.995
<i>But for some reason,</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:19.203
<i>this time was different.</i>

02:59.379 --> 03:00.676
I...

03:02.081 --> 03:03.343
I want to kill myself.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.113
Fill this out. So...

03:31.778 --> 03:33.268
How you doing?

03:38.851 --> 03:40.045
You got a cigarette?

03:41.688 --> 03:43.588
Uh... No, sorry.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.456
What's wrong with you?

03:48.494 --> 03:49.722
I just don't smoke.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.321
No, I mean,
why are you in an ER,

03:52.398 --> 03:54.366
at 5:00 on a Sunday morning?

03:58.671 --> 03:59.899
Well...

04:00.873 --> 04:02.568
I guess,
there's just been

04:03.943 --> 04:06.707
a lot going on
in my mind lately.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.041
Go ahead.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.043
Okay, well, this is sort
of difficult to explain.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.886
But...
See there's this girl...

04:15.121 --> 04:17.885
Yeah, got you.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.856
And this summer
school application that
I'm really nervous about.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.157
Summer school?

04:24.530 --> 04:27.897
Yeah, it's like
this super prestigious,
kind of...

04:29.102 --> 04:31.070
Why would you want to be
in school in the summer?

04:32.872 --> 04:35.773
You should be
on Coney Island,
bird-dogging chicks.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.407
Are you a doctor?

04:38.478 --> 04:40.173
What do you think?

04:41.247 --> 04:44.512
You... You don't really
seem like a doctor.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.191
<i>You ever heard of
Doogie Howser?</i>

05:03.803 --> 05:06.931
Well, I hope
they fix whatever's
wrong with you.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.334
Thank you.
Yeah.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.791
So, how long have you
been feeling suicidal?

05:28.561 --> 05:32.588
I don't know.
I've been depressed
for about a year.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.893
Mmm-hmm.

05:33.966 --> 05:38.096
And I've thought
about it before,
but never like this.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.833
You know,
never so real.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.409
Did anything happen today
specifically to trigger
these feelings?

05:47.580 --> 05:50.413
<i>Sometimes I wish
I had an easy answer
for why I'm depressed.</i>

05:50.483 --> 05:53.475
<i>That my father beat me.
Or I was sexually abused.</i>

05:53.553 --> 05:56.716
<i>But my problems are
less dramatic than that.</i>

05:57.156 --> 05:59.556
<i>Like, my dad always asks
the wrong questions.</i>

05:59.625 --> 06:02.924
So, Craig,
how's the Intro to
Wall Street class?

06:06.132 --> 06:08.362
<i>So maybe this is
a slight exaggeration,</i>

06:08.434 --> 06:11.028
<i>but I do have a problem
with stress vomiting.</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:14.204
<i>And my friends sometimes
look at me like
I'm from another planet.</i>

06:15.942 --> 06:17.933
<i>And I'm obsessed
with this girl.</i>

06:19.712 --> 06:22.806
<i>Who happens to be going out
with my best friend.</i>

06:24.250 --> 06:28.311
<i>So, is there any one thing
that made me want
to jump off a bridge?</i>

06:31.124 --> 06:33.684
Um... No.
Nothing unusual.

06:33.793 --> 06:34.885
Hmm.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.658
You on any medications?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.891
Zoloft. But I stopped.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.401
Yeah, did your doctor
take you off the meds?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.632
No, I just stopped
on my own.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.597
Oh, you shouldn't do that.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.407
Well, Craig,
it doesn't seem like
you're a danger to yourself.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.708
So, what I'm
gonna suggest is that
we contact your parents,

06:54.781 --> 06:55.770
let them know
what's going on,

06:55.848 --> 06:58.715
and then we refer you
to one of our
outpatient services.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.252
Okay?
But...

07:01.354 --> 07:02.321
I need help now.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.251
I know you're upset.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.853
But, Craig,
the people that we admit
into this facility,

07:07.927 --> 07:09.155
are very, very sick.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.559
I am, too.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.926
Well, can't you just, like,
give me something?

07:14.000 --> 07:14.989
Not without your
parents' consent.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.967
Look, this is
serious business.

07:17.036 --> 07:21.473
Maybe I'm not explaining right
how serious this is.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.977
It feels like everything
is just building up,

07:27.046 --> 07:29.913
and everyone else,
they just seem

07:30.049 --> 07:32.950
to handle everything.
You know, like...

07:33.820 --> 07:36.084
But not me, you know.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.824
I'm scared, okay?

07:39.892 --> 07:42.053
And I can't go
back out there.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.891
I don't know what...

07:44.564 --> 07:46.361
I might do something.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.494
So, I just need some help.
Please. I just need you
to help me.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.871
Welcome to
3 North, Craig.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.278
Um... What exactly
is 3 North?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.075
Our adult psychiatric floor.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.220
Oh, but, I'm only 16.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.453
Our teen floor is undergoing
some renovations,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.685
so all teens are here
with the adults.

08:46.759 --> 08:51.219
And while you're with us,
you'll be expected
to act like one.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.456
So, starting tomorrow,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.127
you'll follow the schedule
and participate in
the group activities.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.997
In the meantime,
we'll contact your family,
and they can bring over

09:00.072 --> 09:02.302
a change of
clothes, toothbrush,
that kind of thing.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.276
Well, I don't think
I'll be here that long.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.675
I have school
tomorrow, so...

09:08.514 --> 09:11.506
You'll have to discuss
that with Dr. Minerva.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.545
Now, do you have any
sharp objects on you?
Pocket knife? Keys?

09:19.325 --> 09:21.088
And your belt
and shoe laces.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.819
My shoe laces?

09:24.497 --> 09:26.124
We can't take any chances.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.840
Hey, Dr. Minerva.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.934
Hey, Smitty.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.070
This is our new patient,
Craig Gilner.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.705
Hi, Craig. How are you?

09:42.815 --> 09:45.409
Um... Just, like, you know.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.519
Well, why don't
you get settled in,
and we'll talk later, okay?

09:50.389 --> 09:51.651
Nice to meet you, Craig.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.185
It'll come to you.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.194
Good morning, Jimmy.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.893
What was that about?

10:00.967 --> 10:02.798
Jimmy? He's a schizophrenic.

10:04.904 --> 10:07.896
Is there a place here
for people more like me?

10:08.674 --> 10:11.165
We got all kinds
of patients here, man.
All kinds...

10:11.477 --> 10:12.603
Hey, hey, Bobby!

10:14.347 --> 10:15.746
My man.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.483
How about a tour for our
new friend, Craig, here?
What do you say?

10:23.522 --> 10:25.046
Sure thing, babe.
Thanks, man.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.250
So, Bobby's gonna
show you around,

10:26.325 --> 10:27.724
while we fix up
your room, okay?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.761
Okay.
Yeah? All right.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.263
See you guys in a jiff.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.269
So, is this like
a mental ward?

10:43.342 --> 10:44.832
Not a ward,
it's a hospital.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.342
Well, this is
where we hang out.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.074
There's a record
player and such.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.277
All the records
are scratched.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.946
Some folks like
to hang out and
play table tennis.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.949
Did they tell you
about the points system?

10:58.024 --> 10:59.389
Points for ping-pong?

10:59.759 --> 11:02.421
I think the name ping-pong
trivializes the sport.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.464
But, I mean,
like, points for privileges,
to hang out in the rec room,

11:06.532 --> 11:08.693
visit the gift shop,
stuff like that.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.168
You can join them if you like.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.701
Uh, no, I'm cool.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.068
Cool Craig. I like that.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.943
This is the shower.
It doesn't have a lock.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.177
So when you go in,
put it on "in-use,"
get it?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.414
I got it.
Okay, you got it,
but nobody else does.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.249
So they'll walk in
on you when you're
scrubbing your balls.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.345
And you don't want that.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.081
There's one in
the other hall, too,

11:32.158 --> 11:33.955
but I wouldn't use it.
It bothers Solomon.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.586
Who's Solomon?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.185
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Cap.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.027
Right here,
this is where
you call people.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.702
Assuming you have people.
Or they can call you.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.361
You know, telephone.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.532
And this is the TV room.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.438
People hang out and
watch TV in that room.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.842
That's why
they call it that.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.917
Um... Who was that?

12:02.988 --> 12:04.785
That's Noelle.
She's one of the teens.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.256
Did they tell you
about the renovations?

12:06.759 --> 12:07.953
Yeah.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.086
How old are you?

12:10.162 --> 12:11.186
Sixteen.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.855
Sixteen!

12:12.932 --> 12:14.729
You look stressed out for 16.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.395
You need to relax.
Get a girlfriend,
or something, you know.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.132
I'm working on it.
Mmm-hmm.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.634
So what is it you
do here, exactly?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.408
Same thing as you.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.479
You're a patient?

12:28.547 --> 12:30.447
What were you doing
in the emergency
room this morning?

12:30.616 --> 12:32.447
ER has the best coffee, son.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.917
They just let you out?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.283
No.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.814
What are you in here for?

12:47.066 --> 12:48.966
Let's go see if Smitty's got
your room ready.

12:53.739 --> 12:57.072
Hey, Muqtada,
got a new roommate, man.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.135
Hey.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.317
Don't take
it personal, man.
He doesn't really talk much.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.079
And I've actually
never seen him
leave the room.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.389
Okay, guys,
lunch in five.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.533
What do they have for lunch?

13:34.847 --> 13:36.178
I'm sorry?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.989
Please, turn out light.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.807
Dr. Minerva.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.241
I'm feeling
much better now.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.213
I was feeling bad
this morning,
but I'm okay now.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.246
So, you know,
I'd like to go home,
if that's cool.

14:15.921 --> 14:19.357
It says here you're suicidal
and asked to be admitted.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.089
Yeah, I thought you guys
could do something quick.

14:24.163 --> 14:28.065
You know,
like give me some medication
to make me feel better.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.361
Or...

14:30.269 --> 14:33.534
Look, I didn't think
that I'd be committed.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.207
I really don't think
I belong here.

14:36.275 --> 14:39.506
A lot of patients
feel that way at first.
Just give it a little time.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.704
How little?

14:40.779 --> 14:41.768
Five days.

14:41.847 --> 14:42.871
Five days?

14:42.948 --> 14:44.677
No more than 30.
We'll have an evaluation

14:44.750 --> 14:46.445
to see if you're ready
to leave on Thursday.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.279
I can't be here
until Thursday

14:50.356 --> 14:53.587
because I'll miss school,
and my friends might
find out where I am.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.422
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Craig.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.191
Depression is
a medical illness.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.459
If you were diabetic,
would you be
embarrassed by that?

15:02.368 --> 15:05.064
Well, can I at least
talk to my mom
about this before...

15:05.204 --> 15:08.196
Of course, Craig.
I just spoke to her,
she's very anxious to see you.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.434
Craig!

15:11.877 --> 15:14.675
<i>Don't blame
my parents for how
messed up I am.</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:17.409
<i>Okay, so my dad
works too much.</i>

15:17.483 --> 15:19.314
<i>And my mom's
a little too fragile.</i>

15:19.385 --> 15:22.115
<i>And my sister's some
kind of child genius.</i>

15:22.187 --> 15:24.849
<i>But it's not like
I was never hugged as
a child or anything.</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:27.051
<i>In fact, they've been
pretty supportive
through all this.</i>

15:27.793 --> 15:31.524
I knew you were
having a hard time,
but I had no idea.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.096
That you were...
That it was...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.302
Well, you're so brave, honey.
I'm so proud of you.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.228
Really? Um...

15:41.573 --> 15:43.370
'Cause I was actually
having second thoughts.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.969
Oh, no, hon. I think
the doctors said
they need you

15:47.046 --> 15:50.140
to stay here for a couple
of days for observation.

15:50.215 --> 15:52.012
I think that's
a real good idea.

15:53.485 --> 15:56.477
But I don't think
you really understand, okay?

15:57.256 --> 16:00.089
Some of the people
in here are really
messed up.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.252
I don't think
my roommate's left
the room in weeks.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.589
I think we better
leave it up

16:04.663 --> 16:07.359
to the doctor's discretion,
you know.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.858
We've tried and...

16:12.071 --> 16:17.839
They're professionals,
they can help you in
ways that we can't.

16:20.412 --> 16:21.879
And I think it's...

16:23.782 --> 16:26.774
I think it looks
like a real nice place.
Right, George?

16:26.852 --> 16:28.649
Take your hands
out of my pockets!

16:32.057 --> 16:35.117
Yeah. When can
I join?

16:35.361 --> 16:36.988
Me, too. Can I stay, too?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.826
Oh, no, honey.
But we'll come and visit.

16:43.035 --> 16:48.302
They took my cell phone,
so some people might
try to call the house.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.208
Just please do not
tell them that I'm in here.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.708
Here are some clothes,
and toiletries and stuff.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.874
And will you
eat something, please?

17:03.122 --> 17:04.919
Lan Curtis.
Who?

17:05.257 --> 17:07.020
Dude from Joy Division.
Hung himself.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.651
Kurt Cobain.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.996
Freud.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.390
Ernest Hemingway.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.657
Salvador Allende.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.363
Jesus Christ, girl.
Can you pick somebody
we've heard of for once?

17:19.438 --> 17:20.496
Chilean president.

17:20.571 --> 17:23.233
Shot himself rather than
surrender to a fascist
military coup.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.440
Mmm-mmm.
I don't think that counts.

17:25.511 --> 17:26.603
Of course,
it counts.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.236
If he was going
to die anyway,
it doesn't count.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.302
Hey, Craig!

17:30.082 --> 17:31.913
Come sit with the men.

17:36.321 --> 17:40.724
Craig, this is my pal, Johnny,
and this clown right here,
this is Humble.

17:42.094 --> 17:43.356
You got
a girlfriend?

17:43.529 --> 17:44.655
He's working on it.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.287
They got some
cute ones your age.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.128
I had a lot of women
in my day, kid.

17:48.634 --> 17:49.726
Yeah?

17:51.770 --> 17:54.261
You don't have to act
so surprised.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.170
Back in the day,
I was Sir Lick-a-Lot.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.007
Ask Bobby.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.844
But you want to know
the secret to keeping
any woman under your spell?

18:06.185 --> 18:07.516
I love you.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.251
That's it?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.989
That's it.
But it don't hurt if
you can play guitar.

18:13.725 --> 18:15.056
Don't mess with
the kid's mind,

18:15.127 --> 18:16.685
he's already screwed up
enough as it is.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.751
Why are you
so screwed, kid?

18:17.830 --> 18:18.819
Mind your own
business, Humble.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.025
That's cool.

18:21.300 --> 18:27.000
But you should know, Craig,
if you don't open up,
you're never going to heal.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.933
Hey, what's the pot up to now?

18:33.345 --> 18:34.972
Eleven.
Eleven?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.108
Yesterday,
it was 12.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.342
Humble ate a buck.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.907
Humble ate a buck?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.849
The professor
bet him a dollar,
he wouldn't eat it. He won.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.949
What is the world
coming to?

18:46.158 --> 18:47.853
Bunch of nut jobs in here,
I'll tell you that.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.458
What's the money for?

18:50.696 --> 18:51.958
Pizza party.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.996
So we don't have
to eat this crap.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.867
They say we can have one,
but we gotta pay
for it ourselves.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.199
Well, I have eight dollars.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.007
Well, you don't have to
go bragging about it, Craig.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.773
People in here have nothing.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.005
Show a little
humility, please.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.605
No. I didn't mean...
It's...

19:10.682 --> 19:12.741
It's okay. You're young,
you'll learn.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.682
Craig.
You get two points
for eating, man.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.820
I bet Smitty's
got 15 bucks on him.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.262
And he's got
a 20 spot. I saw it.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.389
Let's go jump him
in the parking lot.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.764
It's under the hat.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.063
It's under the hat?

19:34.506 --> 19:35.598
Sorry.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.506
Check.

19:50.789 --> 19:54.316
So, Craig, how are you
adjusting to 3 North?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.987
Uh... Okay, I guess.

19:58.063 --> 20:01.430
Dr. Mahmoud wrote that
you were taking Zoloft,

20:01.700 --> 20:03.793
but went off it
three weeks ago.
Is that right?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.363
Yeah.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.927
Do you see a therapist?

20:07.005 --> 20:10.133
Dr. Yanof was the one
who prescribed me the Zoloft.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.804
I see her every,
you know, month or so.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.203
Why did you stop taking it?

20:17.549 --> 20:21.918
I guess
I thought I was better.
Like I didn't need it.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.380
Maybe that's because
it was working.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.592
Can you describe to me
how you were feeling

20:27.659 --> 20:29.422
before coming
here this morning?

20:30.462 --> 20:32.930
I guess, depressed.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.131
Anxious, stressed.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.829
Have you been
feeling more stress
than usual lately?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.802
Any reason in particular?

20:42.874 --> 20:46.207
Yeah. There's this
Franklin Gates
Summer Semester thing

20:46.278 --> 20:47.370
that my dad...

20:47.813 --> 20:50.782
Well, that I really
want to get into.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.407
But the application
is due in a week

20:53.485 --> 20:55.146
and I haven't
even looked at it.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.448
Why not?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.822
Every time I think about it,

20:58.890 --> 21:02.417
my brain starts
this cycling thing
about not getting in.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.462
What would happen
if you didn't get in?

21:05.897 --> 21:08.525
<i>Then I wouldn't
be able to put it on my
college applications.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:11.125
<i>Which means I wouldn't
get into a good college.</i>

21:11.203 --> 21:12.761
But not even Adam Smith
could have foreseen

21:12.838 --> 21:15.068
the inequities of
modern capitalism.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.132
<i>If I didn't get
into a good college,
I wouldn't have a good job.</i>

21:18.210 --> 21:21.145
<i>Diffusing the situation
in Iran through
unilateral diplomacy</i>

21:21.213 --> 21:23.443
<i>is my top priority
as Commander in Chief.</i>

21:24.716 --> 21:27.549
<i>Which means I wouldn't
be able to afford
a good lifestyle.</i>

21:28.920 --> 21:31.912
Hey, MTV. It's your boy,
Craig Gilner.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.719
Welcome to my crib.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.119
<i>So I wouldn't be able
to find a girlfriend.</i>

21:38.196 --> 21:40.892
<i>Which means I'd
probably get depressed.</i>

21:41.867 --> 21:45.200
<i>And I'd end up like Muqtada
in a place like this
for the rest of my life.</i>

21:47.172 --> 21:49.902
So, what would happen
if I didn't get in?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.634
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.648
Do you have anyone
you can explain it to?
Friends? Family?

22:01.153 --> 22:05.613
I have friends and family,
but it's not always easy.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.354
It's important to
have a support system.

22:09.428 --> 22:10.986
People you can
really talk to.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.428
Have you been having
any other symptoms?

22:15.534 --> 22:19.197
I have trouble eating.
I can't keep it down.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.465
All right.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.475
You'll start group
activities tomorrow,

22:24.543 --> 22:26.101
we'll check in
again on Tuesday.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.837
You have any questions?

22:28.914 --> 22:30.245
Yes. Um...

22:31.216 --> 22:32.410
If I'm feeling better,

22:32.484 --> 22:34.452
do you think I can get out
of here by tomorrow?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.953
Because I have school
and this application and...

22:37.022 --> 22:39.013
Five days, Craig. Minimum.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.082
I know this seems
like a strange place
at first,

22:41.159 --> 22:43.423
but try to make
the most of it.

22:47.866 --> 22:48.958
<i>It's Monday.</i>

22:51.069 --> 22:54.971
<i>I shouldn't be waking up
next to some depressive
middle-aged Egyptian dude.</i>

22:58.677 --> 23:02.477
<i>I shouldn't be showering
on a co-ed floor in
a stall without a lock.</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:05.148
<i>I shouldn't be
lining up for meds</i>

23:05.217 --> 23:08.118
<i>behind schizophrenics
and sociopaths.</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:12.683
<i>It's Monday,
I should be in school.</i>

23:14.025 --> 23:17.426
<i>But I guess
that's what got me here
in the first place.</i>

23:17.629 --> 23:19.529
<i>When my parents
went to school,</i>

23:19.598 --> 23:21.725
<i>they just went
to the one closest
to their house.</i>

23:21.800 --> 23:23.324
<i>Makes sense, right?</i>

23:23.402 --> 23:25.529
<i>A lot of places
are still like this.</i>

23:25.604 --> 23:28.767
<i>Cleveland, probably Denver.</i>

23:28.840 --> 23:30.467
<i>But not New York.</i>

23:31.009 --> 23:33.375
<i>You've got schools
for science geeks like...</i>

23:33.445 --> 23:35.106
Bronx High School of Science.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.477
<i>Schools for thespians.</i>

23:36.548 --> 23:38.675
The LaGuardia School
for the Performing Arts.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.945
<i>Schools for do-gooders.</i>

23:41.019 --> 23:43.954
<i>El Puente Academy
for Peace and Justice.</i>

23:44.022 --> 23:45.421
<i>But the most
competitive of all</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:47.788
<i>New York City public schools
is this one.</i>

23:47.859 --> 23:49.121
<i>Executive Pre-Professional.</i>

23:49.961 --> 23:51.292
<i>My school.</i>

23:51.930 --> 23:54.763
<i>This billionaire
philanthropist named
Gerard Lutz</i>

23:54.866 --> 23:57.164
<i>set it up in conjunction
with the public school system.</i>

23:58.036 --> 24:01.199
<i>So it's not some
private school for elite
Upper-East-Siders.</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.036
<i>You can be on welfare
and food stamps,</i>

24:03.108 --> 24:05.440
<i>or your parents
can own an island
in the South Pacific.</i>

24:05.510 --> 24:06.875
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:09.209
You'll be accepted
as long as you're
one of the 800

24:09.281 --> 24:12.341
smartest and most
accomplished students
in the five boroughs.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.182
<i>Like these kids here.</i>

24:38.043 --> 24:41.103
<i>There must have been
a serious clerical error,
because somehow...</i>

24:42.214 --> 24:43.306
I got in.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.374
Me, too.
Me, too.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.645
You, too?
You, too?

24:48.286 --> 24:52.586
<i>That's my best friend, Aaron,
getting flirt-punched by
Nia for the first time.</i>

24:52.858 --> 24:54.485
<i>There were many
more of those.</i>

24:54.793 --> 25:00.288
<i>Followed by hand-holding,
kissing and eventually, sex.</i>

25:01.099 --> 25:02.430
<i>I don't like to
picture that one.</i>

25:03.268 --> 25:06.726
<i>What I would give
to be flirt-punched
by Nia just once.</i>

25:09.674 --> 25:11.198
<i>And so it began...</i>

25:14.980 --> 25:16.538
Look at
those mahatmas.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.075
I always wanted a Harley
with hot, tight mahatmas.

25:21.152 --> 25:24.121
You can have the mahatmas,
I just want the beaver.

25:24.189 --> 25:28.091
Hey, Bobby, check out
this bike.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.128
Yeah, I don't get
wrapped in a bunch of stuff
I can't have.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.925
Relax, it's just
for fun, bro.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.290
That's not fun.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.663
That's propaganda, man.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.599
All those
Madison Avenue types.

25:37.669 --> 25:38.761
Telling you how
to live your life.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.704
Fast cars, hot chicks,

25:42.274 --> 25:45.471
Reese's Pieces, Gucci.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.207
Werther's Original.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.782
I don't buy
into that bullshit.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.412
Are you gonna
eat your burrito, Craig?

25:56.321 --> 25:57.845
No, I'm not hungry.
You can have it.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.557
Hello, Mr. Breakfast Burrito.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.807
Humble, put that back.

26:18.677 --> 26:19.939
He said I could have it.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.175
Yeah, it's really fine.

26:23.281 --> 26:24.873
Craig's gotta eat, too.
Put it back.

26:26.451 --> 26:27.509
Take a hike, Bob.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.445
He's not hungry.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.891
Thanks, Bobby,
but I'm really not hungry.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.697
Fine, what do
I care if you eat?

26:48.807 --> 26:51.105
I understand
there was an incident
this morning.

26:51.176 --> 26:53.371
Would anyone care
to talk about it?

26:55.113 --> 26:57.843
Something involving
a breakfast burrito.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.149
Johnny?

27:02.153 --> 27:04.178
It was between
Bobby and Humble.
Ask them.

27:04.255 --> 27:07.418
I was interested
in hearing it from
an impartial observer.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.653
Well, if you want
my opinion, I think Bobby
has been on edge

27:11.730 --> 27:15.564
because of his interview,
and he's lashing out
because he's nervous.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.534
Interesting observation,
Johnny.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.659
My hemorrhoids are
flaring up too, Johnny.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.365
Want to tell the group
about that?

27:21.439 --> 27:23.464
Hemorrhoids!
It'll come to ya!

27:24.809 --> 27:27.437
Bobby, it's okay
if you want to keep
your feelings private,

27:27.512 --> 27:29.742
but you should know that
there's nothing wrong
with being nervous

27:29.814 --> 27:31.304
about your
interview tomorrow.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.248
I'm not nervous
about my interview.

27:33.685 --> 27:34.845
Then what is it, Bob?

27:34.919 --> 27:36.045
Maybe he's hungry.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.247
He doesn't
look hungry.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.380
He looks tired.

27:38.456 --> 27:39.548
Did you
sleep last night?

27:39.624 --> 27:40.716
He didn't eat today.

27:40.792 --> 27:41.781
Yes, he did.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.056
Did you see him eat?

27:44.129 --> 27:45.426
I'm pretty
sure he ate.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.555
I didn't see him eat.

27:46.631 --> 27:47.757
I get anxious
when I'm tired.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.231
Okay, listen.

27:50.735 --> 27:54.262
I'm not hungry
and I'm not tired.
It's just the sweater.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.397
It's all I have for
my interview tomorrow.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.034
I told you it
was the interview.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.100
It's a nice sweater, Bob.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.204
No, it's not.
It smells like
a hobo's Band-Aid.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.507
But it looks
good on you.

28:04.749 --> 28:06.341
About as good as
your hair looks on you.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.511
Bobby, no insults, please.

28:10.889 --> 28:12.789
I can loan you a shirt.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.756
What was
that, Craig?

28:14.826 --> 28:17.693
I'll just call my mom
and have her bring one
of my dad's shirts over.

28:17.962 --> 28:20.328
It's not a problem.
I live like two blocks away.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.456
No, thanks.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.160
Bobby! Take the shirt.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.229
Yeah, he's trying
to help, Bob.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.834
It's a very
nice offer, Craig.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.738
Bobby, why are you
reluctant to accept it?

28:31.309 --> 28:34.972
'Cause I don't
want any handouts.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.674
It wouldn't exactly
be a handout.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.238
He'd just be
loaning it to you.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.477
Okay, I'll take it.
As long as you'll
get off my back.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.077
Do you want
the shirt, Bobby?

28:42.153 --> 28:43.211
I would...

28:43.888 --> 28:45.116
I would like the shirt.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.589
Craig?

28:46.791 --> 28:48.588
Is it okay if it has
yellow armpit stains?

28:51.229 --> 28:53.697
Sorry,
it was a dumb joke.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.063
When are you
going to let me get
to see her again?

28:59.270 --> 29:02.103
Because I'm her father.
You don't think that I have...

29:02.674 --> 29:05.336
What's that?
I do have...
I will have a place.

29:06.244 --> 29:10.271
I have a...
I'm gonna have a place
on Thursday. It's true.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.242
Listen, I never asked
you for anything.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.586
Could you just, for once,
maybe do what I say.
Hello? Hello!

29:32.203 --> 29:34.194
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

29:34.806 --> 29:36.603
Hey, Craig. It's me.

29:36.674 --> 29:40.110
<i>Okay. So,
she's probably not in
the bathtub right now,</i>

29:40.178 --> 29:42.339
<i>but this is how
I sometimes like
to picture Nia.</i>

29:42.981 --> 29:44.414
<i>It's sick, I know.</i>

29:44.816 --> 29:46.181
You were acting
a little weird earlier,

29:46.251 --> 29:48.446
so I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.919
All right, that's it.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.081
I'm with Aaron.
He's being such
a tool. Bye!

29:54.125 --> 29:57.253
Hello, Mr. Gilner,
this is your science teacher,
Mr. Reynolds.

29:57.328 --> 30:00.957
We really need to talk
about your missing
lab assignments.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.096
Five of them.

30:22.787 --> 30:23.776
Hello?

30:24.422 --> 30:25.821
Hey, Nia. What's up?

30:26.191 --> 30:31.219
Hey! Just finishing
my Gates Summer app.
I'll freak if I don't get in.

30:32.197 --> 30:33.824
<i>What's up with you?</i>

30:33.998 --> 30:38.128
Um. Just feeling
kind of, you know...

30:38.436 --> 30:41.872
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that why you weren't
in school today?

30:42.173 --> 30:45.472
Yeah, I was
feeling pretty shitty,
so I just stayed home.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.573
<i>Yeah. I get like that
sometimes, too.</i>

30:48.379 --> 30:50.244
Depressed or whatever.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.710
Do you take
anything for it?

30:54.619 --> 30:55.881
Um...

30:56.888 --> 30:58.617
Look, I never
told anybody this.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.319
<i>Not even Aaron, but,
if it makes you
feel any better,</i>

31:03.294 --> 31:04.261
<i>I see a therapist.</i>

31:04.329 --> 31:05.353
Really?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.824
For, like,
over a year now.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.423
<i>I had no idea.</i>

31:09.500 --> 31:11.468
Yeah, it's pretty
embarrassing.

31:13.171 --> 31:14.866
<i>I take Zoloft.
Shut up!</i>

31:15.206 --> 31:16.264
<i>I do.</i>

31:16.341 --> 31:18.400
Oh, my God!
We're like so
screwed up.

31:18.476 --> 31:21.343
Yeah, we're like partners
in mental illness.

31:21.679 --> 31:22.805
<i>The illest.</i>

31:23.348 --> 31:26.840
I'm Solomon.
I would ask you to
please keep it down.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.647
I'm trying to rest.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.112
<i>Craig, who is that?</i>

31:31.189 --> 31:33.885
Um...
Excuse me.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.550
<i>Is everything okay?
Will you be much longer?</i>

31:35.627 --> 31:36.719
One second, please.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.261
<i>Are you like in
a crack den or something?</i>

31:38.329 --> 31:41.196
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Everything's...

31:41.266 --> 31:44.326
It'll come to you.
It will always
come to you.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.902
<i>Where are you?</i>

31:47.972 --> 31:49.530
I gotta go, Nia. Bye.

31:49.607 --> 31:50.733
<i>Craig...</i>

31:50.808 --> 31:52.332
It's all yours.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.242
Thanks, Mom.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.216
You know,
your dad really wanted
to be here today,

32:00.285 --> 32:02.185
he just had a client crisis.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.080
Client crisis?

32:04.689 --> 32:07.317
Yeah, but he said,
he's for sure
coming tomorrow.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.657
Have you made
any friends yet?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.159
Yeah, I guess.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.492
Are you friends
with the tranny?

32:13.564 --> 32:14.588
Oh, the tranny.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.093
Not really.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.696
Did you talk to my school?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.796
Because I really
can't have them finding
I'm in a place like this.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.238
It could really
damage my future.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.469
No, no. I just said
you were in the hospital.

32:25.543 --> 32:26.805
I didn't say
anything specific.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.778
Good. The last thing
I need is for them

32:28.846 --> 32:30.108
to find out I've
been institutionalized.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.648
Transvestite!

32:32.650 --> 32:33.912
Schizo!

32:48.566 --> 32:50.056
What's going on, babe?

32:50.134 --> 32:51.192
Uh...

32:52.637 --> 32:55.105
Sorry. I was just
dropping the shirt off.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.168
She's cute, isn't she?

32:59.677 --> 33:01.372
Yeah. Is she yours?

33:01.446 --> 33:04.279
Veronica. Like the
Elvis Costello song.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.544
How old is she?

33:06.617 --> 33:07.777
Eight and three-quarters.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.984
That's what she says.
Three quarters.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.256
Well, good luck
with your interview.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.761
What's it for,
if you don't
mind me asking?

33:19.364 --> 33:21.229
A group home.

33:21.966 --> 33:23.524
Basically,
I need a place to live

33:23.601 --> 33:25.592
when they kick me out
of here on Thursday.

33:26.704 --> 33:29.832
Let me know if you
need somebody to practice
with or something.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.204
What do you mean?

33:31.275 --> 33:34.039
Like a practice interview.
So you're better prepared.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.944
Yeah?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.379
Yeah.

33:37.448 --> 33:38.472
You want to try?

33:38.549 --> 33:39.538
You want to try now?

33:39.817 --> 33:41.341
If you're not
doing anything.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.614
Okay, great.
Uh... Hold on.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.421
Let me do this with
the official shirt on.

33:51.062 --> 33:54.190
Okay. You're ready?

33:54.832 --> 33:58.268
Hold on one second.
I don't know if
I'll do it like...

33:59.003 --> 34:00.971
Which is better, like...

34:01.572 --> 34:02.834
This?

34:02.907 --> 34:03.965
Yeah. That looks natural.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.168
Okay.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.670
You can relax.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.014
I'm nervous.

34:13.684 --> 34:17.677
Okay, why is it that you
think you qualify to live
in this group home?

34:18.755 --> 34:22.418
Because if you
don't accept me,
I'll be homeless.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.129
Okay, good.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.301
Yeah, I think you're ready.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.496
Really? I didn't
sound too desperate?

34:34.105 --> 34:36.801
No. But, uh...

34:37.574 --> 34:40.408
You might want to focus
on the positive things

34:40.478 --> 34:42.002
that you get from
this experience

34:42.080 --> 34:44.206
as opposed to, you know...

34:44.849 --> 34:46.077
The negative.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.409
Exactly. Like what
is it that you could
bring to the home?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.717
Something special that
only you could offer.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.955
It could be anything.
Maybe you have
a great attitude?

34:58.029 --> 34:59.087
No.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.131
You always clean up
after yourself?

35:03.801 --> 35:05.166
Not really.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.931
You know, I think
in these situations

35:09.006 --> 35:11.031
it's okay to bend the truth
just a little bit.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.976
Yeah. I just
don't want to get
people's expectations up

35:14.045 --> 35:16.309
and then
disappoint them later.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.481
That's it. You're pragmatic.
That's what you tell them.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.452
Okay, yeah. Right?

35:23.521 --> 35:25.318
Yeah, I know
you're gonna do great.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.151
Thanks.

35:29.427 --> 35:30.860
You want to play
some table tennis?

35:31.762 --> 35:33.354
I'm pretty terrible
at table tennis.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.729
It's all right.
It's just for fun.
Come on.

35:37.502 --> 35:38.799
We play
a lot around here.
The problem is,

35:38.870 --> 35:41.634
most people are
too zonked out on
their meds to compete.

35:42.707 --> 35:43.765
One, zip.

35:44.108 --> 35:45.302
She's a liar.

35:46.611 --> 35:50.877
Please, baby. Baby.
Please listen. Listen.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.815
I love you.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.012
Don't worry about it.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.090
Of course,
I forgive you, baby.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.960
Johnny doesn't phone kiss.

36:20.678 --> 36:21.770
You came.

36:21.846 --> 36:26.180
Yeah. I mean,
I had other plans,
but I canceled them.

36:27.485 --> 36:30.943
Good. I thought
I might have scared
you off yesterday.

36:32.056 --> 36:35.355
Oh, yeah,
celebrity suicide.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.355
It's kind of weird.

36:41.632 --> 36:44.795
Okay, so check it out.
We're gonna play
a different game today.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.062
Okay.

36:48.239 --> 36:50.969
I ask you a question
and you ask me a question.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.332
Do we answer them?

36:53.411 --> 36:55.174
It's up to you,
but no matter what,

36:55.246 --> 36:57.476
you have to finish
with a question.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.072
Here we go. You ready?
Yeah.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.346
I said
finish with a question.

37:04.789 --> 37:05.881
Are you stupid?

37:06.023 --> 37:09.220
Uh, no... Are you?

37:09.860 --> 37:13.387
There you go.
Do you think
I'm gross looking?

37:16.934 --> 37:18.993
No. You look awesome.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.098
What's your question?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.909
Why'd you invite me here?

37:26.277 --> 37:28.541
I thought it was nice
that you loaned
Bobby your shirt.

37:29.614 --> 37:32.549
Don't you think
this is a good way
to get to know someone?

37:32.617 --> 37:33.743
Sure.

37:34.285 --> 37:35.809
Have you played this before?

37:35.886 --> 37:37.285
Not in here.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.314
Are you a virgin?

37:41.459 --> 37:43.450
So...

37:44.362 --> 37:45.795
How long have
you been here?

37:46.397 --> 37:48.297
Nice transition, Craig.

37:49.066 --> 37:52.058
Twenty-one days.
Who dragged you here?

37:52.136 --> 37:55.105
I checked myself in,
I guess.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.770
Kind of, by accident.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.077
The suicide hotline
said to come.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.140
Why are you here so long?

38:03.314 --> 38:05.976
They think I might
cut myself again.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.615
Why'd you call
the suicide hotline?

38:07.752 --> 38:09.219
I guess...

38:11.956 --> 38:15.084
Maybe I didn't really
want to kill myself.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.527
But I kind of did.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.627
Does that make sense?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.733
So, where do you go?

38:28.939 --> 38:30.668
Executive Pre-Professional.
You?

38:30.741 --> 38:31.867
Delfin.

38:32.276 --> 38:34.972
You're not some sort of
school uniform perv,
are you?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.511
You guys wear uniforms?

38:37.682 --> 38:38.842
I knew it.

38:39.884 --> 38:44.048
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna
invade your personal
space for one second.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.179
Why?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.252
What are you doing?
I'm just...

38:49.327 --> 38:51.056
Ow, you shocked me.
Make a wish.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.166
What do we do now?

39:04.775 --> 39:06.037
Are you still playing?

39:06.977 --> 39:09.411
No. Are you?

39:10.414 --> 39:12.575
I'll race you
to arts and crafts.

39:18.155 --> 39:19.986
Hey, guys.
No running, please.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.763
Well, well, well!

39:35.039 --> 39:36.939
Still working on it,
Cool Craig?

39:37.007 --> 39:38.804
It's not
what you think.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.844
I think the two of you
were playing the
question game outside.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.276
That's what I think.

39:42.847 --> 39:45.315
Well, I guess it is
what you think then.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.372
I thought so.

39:46.450 --> 39:50.944
This is free period
arts recreational therapy
for you latecomers.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.823
I'm Joanie,
recreation director.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.324
I'm Craig.

39:55.393 --> 39:59.659
Well, materials
are on the table, Craig.
So just go for it.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.455
That's okay.
I don't really draw.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.997
Sure you do.
It doesn't have to
be representative,

40:05.069 --> 40:07.037
it can be abstract,
whatever you want.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.265
Well, I'll just hang out,
if that's okay.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.969
Everybody?
Our new guest, Craig,

40:13.043 --> 40:16.035
is having what we call
an artistic block.

40:16.947 --> 40:18.539
He doesn't know
what to draw.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.845
How about beavers?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.911
Humble, we do not
draw the sort of beavers
you're talking about.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.183
Oh, really?

40:27.992 --> 40:29.118
That's actually nice.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.286
I thought it was
gonna be a vagina.
That's nice.

40:31.662 --> 40:33.220
Rolling pin!

40:33.297 --> 40:35.993
What was that, Roger?
Did you say something?

40:37.768 --> 40:38.962
This is weird.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.971
Look, she's not gonna
get off your back until
you draw something.

40:42.039 --> 40:43.631
Can be anything.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.972
I bet you got some
crazy stuff in that messed up
little mind of yours.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.798
<i>America has created
the longest</i>

41:17.875 --> 41:21.276
<i>peace time economic
expansion in our history.</i>

41:23.614 --> 41:24.638
Shit!

41:24.715 --> 41:27.047
<i>With nearly
18 million new jobs,</i>

41:27.685 --> 41:30.711
<i>wages rising at more than
twice the rate of inflation.</i>

41:30.788 --> 41:32.517
<i>The highest home
ownership in history.</i>

41:33.791 --> 41:35.588
Craig, honey,
what's the matter?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.629
I can't do it.
Five years old and
I'm already a failure.

41:39.697 --> 41:40.755
What can't you do?

41:40.831 --> 41:43.322
I can't even trace Manhattan
on tracing paper.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.527
Tracing paper!
Are you kidding me?

41:45.603 --> 41:49.835
Craig, you can't
trace freehand and
expect it to be perfect.

41:50.541 --> 41:51.667
Why not?

41:51.742 --> 41:54.074
Because, honey,
you're five years old.

41:54.378 --> 41:55.902
That's no excuse.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.915
Mozart composed
three major symphonies
by the time he was five.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.382
Actually, Craig,
it was four.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.578
I have an idea.

42:02.653 --> 42:04.985
Instead of trying to
trace maps of Manhattan,

42:05.055 --> 42:08.024
why don't you just
make up your own maps?

42:09.226 --> 42:10.523
Of imaginary places.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.697
Oh, looks like
somebody got unblocked.

42:50.768 --> 42:52.292
That is extraordinary.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.064
What is it?
It's so pretty.

42:54.338 --> 42:57.432
Looks like a brain
or something, right?

42:57.508 --> 42:59.942
Yeah, it's a brain map.

43:00.277 --> 43:01.767
It's a great brain map.

43:01.845 --> 43:03.210
It's beautiful.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.144
A smart talent.

43:05.716 --> 43:07.684
I didn't
get the brain part.
Looks like a city.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.048
Hey, Craig,
you got a phone call, man.

43:13.691 --> 43:14.715
Hello?

43:14.792 --> 43:16.054
Is this the loony bin?

43:16.594 --> 43:19.324
<i>Okay, I've been
putting this off,</i>

43:19.396 --> 43:20.658
<i>but I guess you
should know more</i>

43:20.731 --> 43:21.789
<i>about my best friend, Aaron.</i>

43:22.333 --> 43:24.801
<i>He's the kind of guy
that life just comes
easy to.</i>

43:24.868 --> 43:28.770
<i>He's got a 4.6 GPA.
I don't even see
how that's possible.</i>

43:29.039 --> 43:31.098
<i>And he'll
probably get into
the Gates Summer Program,</i>

43:31.208 --> 43:32.539
<i>and claim something like...</i>

43:32.810 --> 43:35.711
I didn't even
apply to that thing.
They totally recruited me.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.713
Whatever, it'll look good
on my college apps.

43:37.781 --> 43:41.239
<i>Not that he'd need it.
His extra-curriculars
are out of control.</i>

43:41.318 --> 43:43.115
<i>I mean,
Aaron does everything.</i>

43:46.657 --> 43:48.124
He plays sports.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.652
<i>He started a film society.</i>

43:52.796 --> 43:56.288
<i>He invented that
adapter thing that converts
vinyl albums into MP3s.</i>

43:58.602 --> 44:00.570
<i>I just couldn't compete.</i>

44:01.305 --> 44:02.533
How'd you get this number?

44:02.606 --> 44:04.005
<i>My girl gave it to me.</i>

44:04.074 --> 44:05.541
How'd you end up
in adult psych?

44:06.176 --> 44:08.144
Do they serve beer in there?

44:08.212 --> 44:10.680
Dude, can you
get me any Vicodin?

44:10.748 --> 44:12.238
Come on, guys.
Leave him alone.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.150
Seriously, Craig,
what happened?

44:16.253 --> 44:18.881
I don't know.
I had a bad night.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.256
<i>What do you mean,
a bad night?</i>

44:22.226 --> 44:24.524
I'm just feeling...

44:24.595 --> 44:26.722
Dude, you just need
to chill more, okay?

44:26.797 --> 44:28.560
Your problem is,
you never chill.

44:28.966 --> 44:31.491
<i>I'm gonna be chilling tonight,
where you gonna be?</i>

44:31.568 --> 44:33.729
Here. I'm gonna be here.

44:33.904 --> 44:37.396
Oh, my God, Craig!
There is so nothing wrong
with you.

44:37.741 --> 44:40.608
Yes, there is.
I'm depressed.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.239
I take pills for it.
Ask Nia.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.047
Ask Nia what?

44:46.216 --> 44:47.376
<i>Craig!</i>

44:47.451 --> 44:50.147
Forget it. Maybe if
you weren't such a dick,

44:50.821 --> 44:53.051
people would talk to you
more and you would know
this kind of stuff.

44:53.290 --> 44:55.815
Dude, is this some kind of
pity play for my girlfriend?

44:57.061 --> 44:58.494
<i>Aaron...
What?</i>

44:58.762 --> 45:00.024
Fuck you.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.899
I know, keep it down.
I'm sorry.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.541
I don't have any friends.

45:26.356 --> 45:28.790
This is very
tough thing to learn.

45:46.276 --> 45:50.372
Huh. Seems here someone
neglected to turn in their
Gates Summer application.

45:50.447 --> 45:53.245
Who is it that doesn't want
to study at Franklin Gates
this summer?

45:53.317 --> 45:54.875
Or eventually get
into a good college?

45:54.952 --> 45:58.046
Get a good job.
Have a good lifestyle.
Get laid.

45:58.455 --> 46:00.650
I don't understand
why anyone would want
to end up depressed,

46:00.724 --> 46:02.316
alone and homeless

46:02.392 --> 46:03.654
in a psych ward.

46:03.727 --> 46:06.924
Sleeping next to
some asocial reject
named Muqtada.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.145
How many times are you gonna
wind up in here again, huh?

46:28.218 --> 46:30.311
What is the matter with you?

46:30.587 --> 46:33.181
How can you let your child
see you like this, huh?

46:33.991 --> 46:35.481
What kind of
father are you?

46:36.293 --> 46:38.261
I honestly think
it'd be better off

46:38.328 --> 46:40.796
for her, for all of us,
if you were just dead.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.656
But you can't
even get that right.

46:44.501 --> 46:47.834
Excuse me, miss,
you're going to have to leave.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.035
Come on.

46:59.016 --> 47:00.449
You okay, Bobby?

47:05.656 --> 47:06.987
My accountant.

47:07.491 --> 47:10.324
Check the wrong box
and the woman goes nuts.

47:12.930 --> 47:16.297
And so, who was
there buying soy milk?

47:16.366 --> 47:18.800
Alec Baldwin,
which I thought
was kind of cool.

47:19.603 --> 47:22.367
And I talked to
the admissions guy
at Gates.

47:22.439 --> 47:23.872
He agreed to give you
an extension.

47:26.610 --> 47:30.910
But, you just focus
on getting well, honey.
Don't stress about that. Okay?

47:30.981 --> 47:33.848
Uh, yeah, you shouldn't
stress about it.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.653
That doesn't mean
it's not important
to try for it.

47:39.723 --> 47:41.156
George...

47:41.725 --> 47:44.888
Don't you have
a client in crisis
somewhere, Dad?

47:46.964 --> 47:48.795
It'll come to you!

48:05.215 --> 48:06.580
Hey, Bobby.

48:10.687 --> 48:12.211
How was your interview?

48:40.517 --> 48:41.848
I blew it.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.413
What happened?

49:11.248 --> 49:12.875
Calm down! Calm down!

49:16.286 --> 49:19.722
Okay, man.
Easy, easy. Easy does it.

49:20.023 --> 49:23.481
Here we go.
Okay. It's all right.

49:32.069 --> 49:35.368
And was that
difficult for you?
Seeing Bobby like that?

49:37.607 --> 49:39.541
I was scared.

49:39.609 --> 49:41.338
Not that he was gonna
hurt me or anything.

49:41.411 --> 49:44.471
Just, you know,
seeing someone
lose it like that.

49:45.415 --> 49:47.645
You know,
it reminded me of
how I feel sometimes.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.049
How's that?

49:50.053 --> 49:52.851
Like I'm on the verge
of just blowing up.

49:53.557 --> 49:58.324
All the stress and pressure
and anxiety just bubbling up.

49:59.963 --> 50:02.158
But I'm never able
to let it out like that.

50:02.232 --> 50:03.494
You know,
I just keep it inside.

50:03.567 --> 50:05.432
Have you always
felt that way?

50:06.470 --> 50:08.597
Well, not when
I was a kid.

50:09.906 --> 50:11.066
Tell me about it.

50:11.842 --> 50:12.900
What do you mean?

50:13.610 --> 50:16.579
About a time you remember
being happy. Carefree.

50:23.787 --> 50:24.776
Uh...

50:25.822 --> 50:28.723
There was this one day
back in eighth grade.

50:28.792 --> 50:33.252
<i>It wasn't that long ago,
but time felt different
back then.</i>

50:34.231 --> 50:36.256
<i>Like there was more of it.</i>

50:38.702 --> 50:40.636
<i>We spent the morning
at Coney Island.</i>

50:45.742 --> 50:48.575
<i>Afterwards,
we rode our bikes
through Bay Ridge,</i>

50:52.582 --> 50:53.981
<i>Sunset Park,</i>

50:56.653 --> 50:58.018
<i>Park Slope,</i>

51:00.490 --> 51:02.219
<i>Downtown Brooklyn,</i>

51:04.594 --> 51:06.221
<i>Brooklyn Heights,</i>

51:07.564 --> 51:09.498
<i>all the way to
the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

51:23.747 --> 51:25.715
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

51:30.454 --> 51:33.116
Girls, grades,
parents, two wars,

51:33.190 --> 51:36.250
impending
environmental catastrophe,
a messed up economy...

51:36.326 --> 51:40.558
All these things seemed
to come out of nowhere,
like on the same day.

51:43.133 --> 51:48.765
Craig, there is a saying
that goes something like,

51:50.006 --> 51:53.737
"Lord, grant me the strength
to change the things I can,

51:54.444 --> 51:56.912
"the courage to accept
the things I can't,

51:56.980 --> 51:58.914
"and the wisdom to
know the difference."

52:02.152 --> 52:03.210
So...

52:05.689 --> 52:08.123
So, let's talk
about your parents.

52:09.025 --> 52:11.152
You think I can
change my parents?

52:11.228 --> 52:13.025
No, but I'm a psychiatrist.

52:13.096 --> 52:15.496
So I have to ask you
about them at some point.

52:16.766 --> 52:17.755
Um...

52:19.970 --> 52:20.994
They're good people.

52:21.071 --> 52:23.972
But, okay, take my dad.
I just saw him today.

52:24.040 --> 52:28.477
And he knows I'm in here
'cause I'm stressed out,

52:28.545 --> 52:30.479
but he still brings up
the Gates application.

52:30.547 --> 52:33.141
It's, like,
"Get a clue, Dad.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.411
"There's something
bigger going on here."

52:35.719 --> 52:37.311
And what's that?

52:39.890 --> 52:41.357
I don't know.

52:42.792 --> 52:44.089
But it feels big.

52:51.635 --> 52:52.727
Thanks.

52:52.802 --> 52:54.167
No problem.

52:56.106 --> 52:57.835
Is everything okay?

52:59.042 --> 53:02.808
Yeah, just screwing
the pooch with my interview.
It's okay.

53:03.346 --> 53:04.244
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:04.314 --> 53:05.303
I'm over it.

53:05.382 --> 53:06.679
Really?

53:06.750 --> 53:09.116
Not really,
I'm just zonked on Ativan.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.346
Where'd you get
the ice cream?

53:10.420 --> 53:12.445
Mister Softee,
across the street.

53:13.323 --> 53:14.517
Bobby, man!

53:14.591 --> 53:15.717
I want ice cream.

53:15.792 --> 53:17.623
Can I have a lick, Bob?

53:17.694 --> 53:19.457
Got to do
two points off, Bob.

53:19.529 --> 53:21.019
It's worth it.

53:21.498 --> 53:23.159
What's with these points?

53:23.233 --> 53:24.530
Yeah, what is
with these points?

53:24.601 --> 53:28.093
I mean, seriously,
no one could possibly be
keeping track of all of them.

53:28.171 --> 53:31.334
That's
three points off for
doubting the system.

53:31.408 --> 53:33.706
Ah, screw the system.
You can have some
of my points.

53:33.777 --> 53:35.540
Johnny needs a lick.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.102
It looks good.

53:42.419 --> 53:43.579
What's this?

53:43.653 --> 53:44.847
Dollar.

53:45.589 --> 53:47.352
For the pizza party.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.284
Where'd you get this?
Don't worry about it.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.600
Yeah, it's a true story.

54:05.175 --> 54:06.437
He was one of
the Black Panthers.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.067
And you never
heard from him again?

54:08.345 --> 54:09.505
Mmm-mmm.

54:09.746 --> 54:12.078
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

54:12.148 --> 54:13.843
Don't touch me.
See that lady right there?

54:13.917 --> 54:15.612
She was a radical
academic up at Columbia,

54:15.685 --> 54:17.118
and then they
passed the Patriot Act.

54:17.187 --> 54:18.950
You know what
the Patriot Act is?

54:19.022 --> 54:20.148
Yeah.
Okay.

54:20.223 --> 54:23.852
When they passed
the Patriot Act,
then she went bonkers.

54:25.295 --> 54:28.230
She thought that Bush
put bugs in all the phones.

54:38.408 --> 54:39.466
<i>Pretty crazy, right?</i>

54:40.610 --> 54:42.578
And that guy,
Solomon, over there?

54:43.847 --> 54:45.246
He's nuts, too.

54:45.315 --> 54:48.944
He's part of this
Hasidic acid-head scene
in Williamsburg.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.432
He did 100 tabs of acid.

55:10.073 --> 55:12.735
Don't look, don't look.
In one night.

55:14.577 --> 55:16.875
And hasn't been
the same since.

55:17.847 --> 55:18.905
Yeah.
Wow!

55:18.982 --> 55:20.882
Yeah. Crazy, right?

55:21.418 --> 55:22.476
Kinda cool.

55:22.552 --> 55:24.110
Some cool people in here.

55:24.187 --> 55:25.882
Yeah, uh...

55:26.923 --> 55:28.447
What about you?

55:29.993 --> 55:31.483
What about me?

55:34.264 --> 55:35.629
I just...

55:35.699 --> 55:37.291
You know, um,
your daughter, Veronica.

55:37.367 --> 55:38.891
When are you
gonna see her again?

55:39.869 --> 55:44.135
You know, I think
my daughter is just
better off without me.

55:45.275 --> 55:46.742
Come on.
No, really.

55:46.810 --> 55:49.711
I mean, I'm not really
a role model in this place,

55:49.779 --> 55:51.610
and I think she's just...

55:53.817 --> 55:55.444
She's better off.

55:57.354 --> 56:00.949
Look, I know that
it's none of my business,

56:01.624 --> 56:04.559
and you can
tell me to get lost
whenever you want,

56:07.197 --> 56:09.597
but I think that she's just
gonna want her dad around,

56:09.666 --> 56:11.861
and I don't think
she's gonna care about...

56:11.935 --> 56:13.698
You should get lost.

56:18.541 --> 56:19.633
Okay.

56:24.114 --> 56:25.877
I think the Ativan's
wearing off, I'm sorry.

56:26.950 --> 56:28.281
It's fine.

56:28.785 --> 56:30.150
Sorry.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.217
Do you have any
other puke stories

56:35.291 --> 56:36.417
that you'd like
to share with me,

56:36.493 --> 56:37.619
while we're getting
to know each other?

56:37.694 --> 56:38.820
I have a few actually.

57:04.888 --> 57:05.912
Want to try?

57:05.989 --> 57:06.978
No, it's okay.

57:07.056 --> 57:09.524
Welcome back to
musical exploration.

57:09.893 --> 57:12.953
Um, who doesn't
have an instrument?

57:15.865 --> 57:19.323
No worries, bro.
Let's get you right
up here on vocals.

57:21.304 --> 57:23.704
Uh, no, I can't sing.

57:24.007 --> 57:25.099
Like he can't draw.

57:25.642 --> 57:27.769
Seriously, I...
No, I'm just...

57:28.211 --> 57:30.702
Cool Craig,
what are you afraid of?
Come on.

57:31.881 --> 57:33.781
Craig,
get up there. Craig.

57:34.684 --> 57:37.346
Craig, Craig, Craig.

57:48.765 --> 57:50.255
You know this one?

57:50.366 --> 57:51.856
I think I've heard it before.

57:51.935 --> 57:52.959
All right.

57:53.036 --> 57:54.901
Bobby and the ladies
will help you out.

57:54.971 --> 57:56.165
The ladies?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.704
Okay, people,
just like we practiced
last week.

58:01.311 --> 58:02.710
You guys ready?

58:02.779 --> 58:03.973
Here we go.

58:41.851 --> 58:45.582
<i>Pressure pushing
down on me</i>

58:45.655 --> 58:49.921
<i>Pressing down on you
no man ask for</i>

58:49.993 --> 58:51.790
<i>Under pressure</i>

58:51.861 --> 58:54.159
<i>That burns a building down</i>

58:54.230 --> 58:56.562
<i>Splits a family in two</i>

58:56.633 --> 58:58.692
<i>Puts people on streets</i>

59:05.875 --> 59:06.899
<i>That's okay</i>

59:06.976 --> 59:11.606
<i>It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about</i>

59:11.681 --> 59:14.149
<i>Watching some good
friends screaming</i>

59:14.217 --> 59:15.479
<i>Let me out!</i>

59:15.752 --> 59:19.711
<i>Pray tomorrow
gets me higher</i>

59:19.789 --> 59:23.555
<i>Pressure on people,
people on the streets</i>

59:26.396 --> 59:28.694
<i>Turned away from it all</i>

59:28.765 --> 59:30.289
<i>Like a blind man</i>

59:31.501 --> 59:34.163
<i>Sat on a fence
but it don't work</i>

59:35.238 --> 59:38.901
<i>Keep coming up with love
but it's so slashed and torn</i>

59:38.975 --> 59:42.240
<i>Why? Why?</i>

59:42.312 --> 59:48.615
<i>Why?</i>

59:50.353 --> 59:52.913
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

59:54.057 --> 59:57.891
<i>Insanity laughs
under pressure
we're cracking</i>

59:57.961 --> 01:00:01.829
<i>Can't we give ourselves
one more chance</i>

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:05.857
<i>Why can't we give love
that one more chance</i>

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.800
<i>Why can't we give love</i>

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.998
<i>Give love, give love
Give love, give love</i>

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:14.840
<i>Give love, give love
Give love, give love</i>

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:20.349
<i>'Cause love's such
an old fashioned word</i>

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:25.718
<i>And love dares you
to change our way of</i>

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:29.884
<i>Caring about ourselves</i>

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:33.895
<i>This is our last dance</i>

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.899
<i>This is ourselves</i>

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.595
<i>Under pressure</i>

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.036
<i>Under pressure</i>

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.071
<i>Pressure</i>

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.797
<i>Oh, my God,
you're like a total
rock star.</i>

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.802
Like the whole
school's obsessed with you.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.963
You're all anyone
talks about anymore.

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:17.904
You might want to think
about getting a new look.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.867
What do you mean?

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.737
Don't worry,
we'll find you
something cool, Craig.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:23.976
Cool Craig.

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.742
<i>What?</i>

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:29.216
Oh, somebody
in here calls me that.
"Cool Craig."

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.387
Is that somebody a girl?

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.481
Uh, no.

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.854
Well, are there any
cute girls in there?

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.793
Not really.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:44.425
Like, a mental hospital
probably isn't
the best spot to hook up.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.195
I'm dying to see this place.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.795
<i>Can I come visit?
Sure.</i>

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.771
Yeah, you can visit.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.934
That is if you don't mind
the groupies hanging
all over me.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.671
Hey, get up.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.672
Yeah, sorry,
I told you I was famous.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.945
They were just
bothering me.

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:08.252
You've really gotta get out
of the room more, Muqtada.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.882
There's a whole
world out there.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.672
It's just me.
Put these on.
Let's go for a walk.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.599
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.467
Sometimes it's just good
to get out of there.

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.106
Charlie, my friend.

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.308
You got 30 minutes.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.512
Hey, what's the deal
with you and Noelle?

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.187
What do you mean?
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.086
Don't play dumb with me.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.681
The two of you are like...

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.659
Your energy is like...

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.428
Those were fireworks.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.800
You should ask her out.

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.000
Ask her out?
Yeah.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.007
Ask her out. Like, out.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.910
Well, I mean,

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:12.878
I like her,

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.579
but I think I'd be too
nervous to ask her out.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.744
What are you nervous about?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.451
Rejection.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.819
Babe, you can't
live your life in fear.

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.019
You're gonna end up
like Muqtada.

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.026
Or worse, me.

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:31.796
That's the part where you go,
"Hey, Bobby, your life's not
that bad," you know.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.926
Oh, sorry, I'm just...

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.230
Relax. It's okay, babe.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.301
But you shouldn't
worry about rejection.

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.500
You shouldn't.
You can practice with me.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.468
Practice what?

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.206
Asking Noelle out.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.214
No, that's okay.
Yeah, I'll be Noelle.

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:48.216
I'll be Noelle. I'm Noelle.

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.043
Uh...

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:55.082
Hey, Craig.
How's it going?

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.949
Hey, Noelle.
I'm well. How are you?

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.519
Oh, good.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:01.889
I get out of here soon,

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.625
which is pretty cool.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.758
Do you like music?

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:08.134
Yeah, sure.

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.668
I like live music.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:17.011
Uh, you just gonna
sit there the whole time
you're asking her out?

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.239
Stand up. I'm a lady.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:21.812
No, look man.
You gotta loosen
up a little bit.

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.010
Come on, loosen up.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.280
Yeah, okay.
Good, good, good.

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:29.082
But I don't
like to go see live music
by myself.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.355
Oh, okay.

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:34.658
Well, maybe we
could go together?

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:38.557
"Well, okay, uh, maybe
we could go together?"

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.499
No. Say that again.
You gotta use
more energy, man.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.799
You gotta go like, "Oh!"
You gotta be excited.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:43.964
Okay.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:47.871
Yeah, uh...
Yeah, okay. Well, maybe
we could go together.

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.638
Oh! Hmm.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.005
Well, well, well.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.574
Who should we see?

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.110
Um...

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.148
U2?

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.048
No.

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:04.550
No.

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.057
Vampire Weekend?

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.964
No, no, no.
Don't be one of
those douchebags

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:14.366
that takes her to some band
that she doesn't care about.

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.671
This is what you do,
and this is very important.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:17.763
Okay.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.740
Ask her what she likes.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.100
Right. Yeah.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.372
Women like to be
asked questions.
Okay.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.641
Like ask me a question.
I'll be Noelle again.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.143
Um...

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.576
Do a little flirtation
in the beginning.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.352
What do you mean by that?

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.949
Comment on my shoes.

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:40.621
Oh, hey, Noelle,
those shoes are awesome.
They really look nice.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.755
Oh, you're sweet
to say that.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.525
It's nothing.
Good.

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.262
You got it.
You're getting it.
You're getting it.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.860
Okay.
Not bad.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.612
How'd you end up in here?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.250
Man, you don't give up,
do you?

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.015
I'm on vacation.

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:12.121
Seriously.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.320
I am serious.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:16.297
Some people go
to the Hamptons.
I come here.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.962
Get a little R & R.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.361
People feed you.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.064
I get high sometimes, man.

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.006
That's not what
I heard about you.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.941
What'd you hear?

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.680
I heard you tried to rape
a penguin at the zoo.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.111
Who told you that?

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:38.418
Relax, babe.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.346
Funny guy, huh?

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.357
Actually, I...

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:53.790
I heard your accountant say
that you tried
to kill yourself.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:59.934
Well, this may come
as a surprise to you,
Cool Craig, but,

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.776
she ain't my accountant.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.606
Gee, really?

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:09.345
And I've tried to
kill myself six times.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.484
I thought about doing that,

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:20.484
but I couldn't
make it to the bridge.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.326
I just came straight here.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.697
What stopped you?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.598
My family, I think.
You know, my parents
and my sister.

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:33.738
Just knowing how bad
it would mess them up.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.542
See, that's the part
I don't get, Craig.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:41.379
I mean,
you're cool, you're smart,
you're talented.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.109
You have a family
that loves you.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:47.246
You know, what I would
do just to be you,
for just a day?

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:55.895
I would...
I would do so much.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.067
I would...

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.462
I don't know.
I would just...

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.832
I'd just live.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.145
Like it meant something.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.251
Let's go.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.032
Smitty, I found
these laying
around somewhere.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.005
What's going on?

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:55.046
Hey, Muqtada.
Are you coming out
for a walk?

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:59.018
What is there to do?

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:01.187
Well, do you like to draw?

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.364
Ping-pong.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.435
Ping what?

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:09.027
You like music?

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.265
Yes.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.566
Okay. Great. Well, um...

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.201
Only Egypt music.

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.070
Oh, well, let's see.

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.312
Excuse me, if you please.
I am trying to rest.

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.176
Sol, have you
met Muqtada?

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.259
If you could
please keep it down.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.220
He has sensitive hearing.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.266
This I think is enough
for one day.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.048
Hey, Craig.

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.048
Hey.

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.552
Um, this is a surprise.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.526
Me and Aaron broke up.

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.556
I'm sorry.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.306
Are you okay?

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:22.100
Uh, yeah. Sorry. Um...

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.610
You must be
really loaded, huh?

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:26.378
Yeah. I'm pretty zonked.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:30.811
So, you know
I've been thinking
about you non-stop

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.320
since we talked on
the phone the other day.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.320
I've been thinking
about you a lot, too.

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:40.053
I woke up and my bed
was on fire!

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.363
What's wrong with that guy?

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:43.957
He's schizophrenic.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:45.692
Weird.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.395
Anyway,

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:53.169
it's like you told me
all this stuff about you
and you're really mature.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.243
Not like everyone else
with their stupid
little problems.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.405
I mean, you're really,
really screwed up.

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.880
I'm a mess.

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.716
But in a good way.
You know, in the way
that gives you

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.410
experience.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.254
So you and Aaron broke up?

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:15.123
<i>Okay, so I know I should
be thinking about Noelle,</i>

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:17.495
<i>and how I'm supposed to be
meeting her in 20 minutes.</i>

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:20.262
<i>But when you have
a really gorgeous
girl in front of you,</i>

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.361
<i>and you've been
obsessing over her
for two years,</i>

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:26.340
<i>and she's biting her lip
and talking low,
and you've got a boner,</i>

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.474
<i>what are you gonna do?</i>

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.243
Do you want to see my room?

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.320
You haven't
finished that yet?

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.484
What?

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:46.717
Oh.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.958
Yes, we have a lot of
activities here, so...

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.730
Takes up...

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.875
Me and Aaron never did
anything like this.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.219
This was totally
on my checklist.

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:21.755
Is someone else in here?

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:22.922
I'm gonna be sick.

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:24.556
Sex!

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.028
Sex in my bed!

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.898
God, that's disgusting.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.996
Children make
sex in my bed!

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.665
Craig, who is this?

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.299
Um, this is my
roommate, Muqtada.

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:35.843
Don't talk to her!

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.071
She try and
make sex in my bed!

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:39.080
Calm down. No one
was having sex, okay?

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.945
Woman is temptress! I know.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.444
What's wrong with you?
Get out.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.918
Uh, he's going
through a hard time.

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:47.148
No, you!
What's wrong with you?

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.951
I'm also going
through a hard time.

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.219
Um, you know what?
You should get some rest,

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.521
and I'll call you
tomorrow or something.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.118
Nia. Nia, wait.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.459
Wait. Nia.

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:05.803
I love you.

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.135
Just get better, Craig.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:17.543
No, I mean...

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.413
Noelle.

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:53.778
Noelle, please.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.088
I'm sorry I messed up.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.926
I love your portrait.
It's amazing.

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.493
I wish you'd open the door.

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.032
Are you okay?

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.639
Oh. Uh...

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.707
This is pretty cool, too.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:25.220
So, our meeting tonight.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:29.185
Is it safe to assume
that's not happening?

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:43.204
You've had it figured
out all along, Muqtada.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.665
Never get out of the bed.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.744
I got in.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.118
In what?

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:04.648
In your mama.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:05.693
Oh.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.857
I got in the home.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.594
That's great.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.202
We missed you at breakfast.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.741
<i>Is this about this
whole NialNoelle fiasco?</i>

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:24.771
How do you
know about that?

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:27.314
Solomon. That dude's
got sensitive hearing.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.482
Look, it's not
just women, okay?

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:33.681
I can't do anything right.
My life's a mess.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.455
No, my life is a mess.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.490
Muqtada's life is a mess.
No offense, babe.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:43.189
All good, papa.

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:46.326
Look, I happen
to like you, Craig.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.496
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:54.037
I was much better looking,
and I didn't have as much
trouble with women...

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.270
Get back on track, man.

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.939
The point is, in 20 years,

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.939
if you're celebrating
your daughter's
eighth birthday

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:03.041
in a place like this,

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.649
I swear to God,

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.380
Muqtada and I are going
to kick your ass.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.989
He not busy being born,

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.820
is busy dying.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.227
You need to believe that.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.009
This Bobby,

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.811
I think, very wise man.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.080
By the way, I was just
coming in to tell you that

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.415
I'm not gonna be
homeless tomorrow.

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:41.714
I'm just saying.

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.009
And guess what?

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.840
It's right next door
to the YMCA.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.279
Yeah. So we can go swimming
in the swimming pool,

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.444
and maybe play
table tennis.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.551
Ping-pong, yes.

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:18.583
It's the same thing.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.185
So listen, your mom will
bring you by on Saturday,

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.924
and we could have a feast.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.733
There are so many people,
you know, not just
in this hospital,

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:03.498
but in the whole world,
who are struggling
so hard just to live.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:09.001
And, it's like,
self-indulgent for me to
not appreciate what I have.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:10.602
Like what?

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:17.317
Well, there's my family,
my home, and my friends.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.780
And you know,
there's this.

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:26.719
I used to think art was just
bourgeois decadence, but...

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.563
It's really wonderful, Craig.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.230
Thanks. Um...

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.139
Yeah, I've done
about 20 of them

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.038
and it's something
that I really enjoy.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.134
What do you enjoy about it?

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.036
It's fun.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:48.846
And it takes my mind
off the things
that stress me out.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.814
You gonna continue it
when you leave?

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:53.880
Yeah.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:57.753
Or, I think.
But my dad might freak.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.958
Have you told him
how you feel?

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:01.222
Not yet.

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:02.691
But you will?

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:05.861
I think so.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:10.132
Thank you.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.642
It's my last
night tonight, Smitty.

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.646
It is your
last night, Craig.

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:23.673
I hate to break it to you,
Craig, but I think
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:28.251
Well, it's Bobby's
last night, too,

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:31.121
so I was wondering if we
could have a pizza party.

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:35.229
Yes, we can.
Yeah. Do you have the money?
If you can get the money.

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:37.629
Yeah, no, I'll have
the money. Yeah, I...

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.326
You have records
you could bring?

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:56.011
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.087
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:05.816
That girl I was with,
she's my best
friend's girlfriend.

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.555
I've been obsessed
with her forever and...

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:09.187
And you're
in love with her?

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:10.889
No.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:13.434
Well, of course not.
But you think she's hot,

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.526
so you told her what you
thought she'd want to hear.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.939
And now you're going to
do the same thing to me.

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.540
No, I'm not.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.141
You're not?

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.981
Look, um,
I do think you're hot.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.248
And I do want to say
the right thing,

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.756
but that's only
because I really like you.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.457
I like how you don't
hide your problems
like everyone else.

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:45.758
And I feel like I don't
have to hide mine
when I'm around you.

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:51.371
You know, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently,

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.168
and I've realized that

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:58.034
if you're not busy being born,
you're busy dying.

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:02.178
And I, for one,
think that we could
both benefit from

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:05.242
being born, again.

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:09.654
Not being born again,
but you know what I mean?

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.887
Gee, thanks for
the wisdom, Bob.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.327
What? He told you that, too?

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.130
Who?
Bobby.

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.894
Yeah, me and about
a billion other people.

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.701
Bob Dylan.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.973
It's the song
you just quoted.

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.104
What? No.
Yes.

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:31.936
Oh.

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:39.417
Anyway, my point is

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.287
I want to play
doctor with you.

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:03.664
This is awesome.

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:14.136
So, how come you
never asked me why?

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:17.179
Why what?

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:29.626
I guess I just
assumed you'd tell me
when you wanted me to know.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:35.093
Thanks.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:44.606
Do you like music?

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.113
Do you like breathing?

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:50.077
That's right.
It was a dumb question.

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:57.924
I like... I like
Radiohead a lot,
the Pixies, T. Rex.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.317
Oh, what else?

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.854
Have you seen them live?

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.594
I saw Radiohead
and the Pixies once.

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:08.260
Cool.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.738
So, uh...

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.439
You know, Vampire Weekend's
doing a show at the end
of the month.

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.912
Would you want to go?

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.345
Yes, I would.

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:29.847
With you, right?

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.551
No, with Solomon.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.688
Yeah, with me.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.531
<i>Sorry guys. Um...</i>

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.496
<i>This is about to
get pretty sappy,</i>

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.666
<i>so I'm just gonna
give you the highlights.</i>

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.505
<i>This is me sharing
the realization that</i>

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:52.569
<i>I don't actually want to be
a CEO, lawyer, or President.</i>

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.547
<i>This is Noelle,</i>

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:58.552
<i>laughing at the idea
that I once wanted
to be President.</i>

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.418
<i>Here, Noelle suggests
I "screw"</i>

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:04.458
<i>the Gates Summer application
if it makes me so unhappy.</i>

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.052
<i>This is me
liking that idea.</i>

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:11.331
<i>This is me thinking about
how to tell my dad.</i>

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:17.162
<i>This is after I tell Noelle
how beautiful I think she is.</i>

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:49.366
Okay, just have them
send the delivery guy
to the third floor.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:50.929
3 North.

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:53.166
<i>No problem, sport.
You got it.</i>

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.833
<i>Thanks, Dad.
Sure.</i>

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.240
Yeah, I'll see you
and Mom tomorrow.

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.369
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:58.935
<i>Okay, bye.
Bye.</i>

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:04.785
Hey, Muqtada.

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.902
<i>Hello?
Hey, man.</i>

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.563
I could really use a favor.

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.947
Hey, found it.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.846
I so appreciate this.

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.548
Yeah, no problem.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.015
Look, man, I'm sorry
I was a bitch to you.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:50.261
I'm sorry
I tried to make out
with your girlfriend.

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.928
How are things with Nia?

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:57.463
Um, we're gonna try
and work through it.

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:58.797
Good.

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.869
You know, I might
hide it pretty well, but,

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.674
I mean, I get that depression
stuff, too, sometimes.

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.079
Yeah?

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.279
Don't kill yourself, okay?

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.282
I won't.

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:14.753
Seriously.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.784
Thanks.

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:25.159
I'll call you tomorrow,
all right?

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.564
Yeah, you will.

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.196
Hey, um...

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.330
Did you really try
to make out with Nia?

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:37.502
Dick.

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:42.850
Pizza's getting cold.
What's up?

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.376
I'm tired, man.

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.989
Think I'll skip out
on the pizza shin-dig.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.683
Pack up.

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:54.420
Ah, vacation's over.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.430
Yes, back to work.

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.762
You got a job?
No.

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.328
Well, congratulations
on your home.

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:04.598
Thanks.

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:11.075
You know, I used that
Dylan line on Noelle.

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.481
How'd it go?

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:18.311
Good. We're gonna
hang out soon.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:20.411
Yeah?
Maybe see some music.

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:22.247
Good.

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:28.851
Here.

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:32.857
It's you.

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:34.925
Yikes. It's a mess
in there, man.

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.998
Oh, it's not such a mess.

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.765
It's just
undergoing renovations.

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.869
Look, I wrote
my number on the back.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.013
We should get
together sometime,
play some table tennis.

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.078
Sure.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:59.184
Cool. Well, I'll see you
tomorrow at breakfast.

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:03.555
Good luck, Craig.

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:07.393
Not that you
need it, but...

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.268
Thanks. You, too, babe.

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.488
Hey, come on.

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:08.722
Trust me.

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:10.352
I gotta dance.

01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:20.504
Excuse me?

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.733
I like this.

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.897
I like this. Yeah!

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:56.902
Look.

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:06.470
So long, buddy.

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.014
You should
probably stay longer.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.777
You might lose it
on the outside.

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:12.650
Um, I'll take my chances.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.415
It'll come to you!

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:19.124
<i>Okay, I know you're
thinking, "What is this?</i>

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.358
<i>"Kid spends a few days
in the hospital</i>

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.919
<i>"and all his problems
are cured?"</i>

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:25.158
<i>But I'm not.
I know I'm not.</i>

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:28.796
<i>I can tell this is
just the beginning.</i>

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:33.132
<i>I still need to face
my homework, my school,
my friends.</i>

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.073
<i>My dad.</i>

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.704
Hello, Smitty.
Hey, hey.

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.737
Thanks for everything.
Yeah.

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:42.277
Sure. You're very
welcome, sir.

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.980
Have you seen Bobby around?

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:47.714
Yeah, Bobby left
pretty early this morning.

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:53.888
<i>But the difference between
today and last Saturday</i>

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:56.586
<i>is that for
the first time in a while,</i>

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.462
<i>I can look forward
to the things
I want to do in my life.</i>

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:03.604
How you feeling?

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.062
I feel like...

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.604
Like I can handle it.

01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:14.974
<i>Bike, eat, drink, talk.</i>

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:17.677
<i>Ride the subway,
read, read maps.</i>

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:19.413
<i>Make maps, make art.</i>

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.954
<i>Finish the Gates application.</i>

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.956
<i>Tell my dad not
to stress about it.</i>

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:25.185
<i>Hug my mom.
Kiss my little sister.</i>

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:26.453
<i>Kiss my dad.</i>

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:27.687
<i>Make out with Noelle.</i>

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:29.326
<i>Make out with her more.</i>

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.865
<i>Take her on a picnic.
See a movie with her.</i>

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:34.400
<i>See a movie with Aaron.
Heck, see a movie with Nia.</i>

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:38.635
<i>Have a party.
Tell people my story.
Volunteer at 3 North.</i>

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.539
<i>Help people like Bobby.</i>

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.336
<i>Like Muqtada.</i>

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.541
<i>Like me.</i>

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:47.843
<i>Draw more. Draw a person.
Draw a naked person.</i>

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:49.412
<i>Draw Noelle naked.</i>

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:52.209
<i>Run, travel, swim, skip.</i>

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.345
<i>Yeah, I know it's lame,
but, whatever.</i>

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:55.753
<i>Skip anyway.</i>

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.053
<i>Breathe.</i>

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:08.893
