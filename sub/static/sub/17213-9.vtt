WEBVTT

00:26.860 --> 00:29.905
- Just a sec, hon.
- Sure, slacker.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.824
No, really. I gotta take this.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.577
Hayes.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.162
Yeah.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.413
Oh, relax.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.917
Manning likes to bluster
about ethics and the environment,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.460
but he'll fold as always.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.255
Besides,
this conference is just a formality.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.883
Once I put the motion through,
it's through.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.010
That pipeline will move ahead on schedule.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.472
No! No, no, no. We'll be out
of that conference by noon

00:55.556 --> 00:57.641
and still make our tee time. You watch.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.186
God.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.480
I'm sweating like a pig here.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.566
This exercise is gonna kill me.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.985
Oh, honey...

01:09.319 --> 01:10.654
don't be silly.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.657
That isn't gonna be what kills you.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.471
Help!

01:36.554 --> 01:38.932
Help! Somebody, help!

02:02.539 --> 02:04.416
Mmm, smells good.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.878
Fine grind, organic.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.296
I know it sounds snobby,

02:09.379 --> 02:11.339
but just you wait...
Tastes even snobbier.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.716
Thank you.

02:14.927 --> 02:15.969
No problem.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.809
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.857
No. Um, it's just...

02:33.445 --> 02:34.487
What?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.159
I don't think I can do this anymore.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.579
Do what?

02:43.288 --> 02:46.583
This. You... staying here with me.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.835
No, you don't need to worry.
I talked to your boss.

02:49.502 --> 02:53.048
- It's not about my job, Marcy.
- So, you talked to my boss?

02:53.131 --> 02:55.467
Uh, yeah, it's settled.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.595
What were you gonna say?

02:58.678 --> 03:02.140
This pretending to be something
that we're not...

03:04.267 --> 03:08.105
I keep saying that it's platonic,
but...

03:09.397 --> 03:11.608
if I'm being honest with myself...

03:13.902 --> 03:15.320
Oh...

03:16.696 --> 03:18.156
It's okay.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.119
I... I think maybe...

03:29.793 --> 03:31.586
it's best if you found your own place.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.258
Oh. Um...

03:37.843 --> 03:39.845
I didn't realize...

03:39.928 --> 03:42.180
The last thing I want is to upset you.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.852
You should go to work.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.772
And... don't worry about me.
I'll find a place tonight.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.442
I mean, it doesn't...
have to be tonight.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.155
It's fine, okay? I understand.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.614
Do you?

04:02.785 --> 04:04.411
Don't leave tonight, 'cause I got dinner--

04:04.494 --> 04:05.620
David.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.164
It is okay.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.042
Just, um...

04:10.125 --> 04:11.626
You should go to work.

04:51.749 --> 04:52.876
Excuse me.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.964
-Do you mind?
-Yeah, I do.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.008
I mind what's going on
between you and Carly.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.134
Carly?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.929
Mmm. Don't pretend you don't know.
That'll just piss me off.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.138
Right.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.183
And we all know what you do
when you get pissed off, don't we?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.102
I would not suggest you try that with me.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.854
Definitely not here.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.480
Okay.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.273
I'll talk to you man to man, all right?

05:16.233 --> 05:19.486
Carly and I had a fight, we separated,
you had some fun with her.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.904
"Fun with her"?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.620
-I seen you around.
-If you're implying that Carly and I--

05:28.703 --> 05:31.498
I'm just here to tell you
that she's the mother of my child,

05:31.581 --> 05:33.500
and I'm trying to get
my family back together.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.543
But if you're in my way--

05:35.627 --> 05:38.213
Actually, you're in my way.
If you wouldn't mind pressing down.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.548
Do you think that this is funny?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.550
No, I think it's pathetic.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.177
-I have interviewed Carly Shannon--
-"Interviewed"?

05:44.261 --> 05:46.721
...on official business, yes,
during which time

05:46.804 --> 05:50.642
the bruises on her arms and her forehead
were pretty goddamned unmistakable.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.851
Okay, accidents happen, man.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.228
Not anymore, they don't.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.939
Does your wife know
that Carly's half your age?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.026
You know, if you were smart...

05:59.109 --> 06:01.444
you'd realize that Carly's
not gonna put up

06:01.528 --> 06:04.864
with an abusive, alcoholic,
loser beat cop anymore,

06:04.948 --> 06:06.449
and you'd move on.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.544
I'll wait for the next one.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.924
You don't have your GED?

06:22.007 --> 06:25.218
Uh, um... that should come through
this week.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.595
I, uh, did the test already.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.306
Just waiting on the papers, Mr. Donald.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.266
Uh, Hank. Call me "Hank."

06:34.853 --> 06:39.566
So, do you have any experience
in landscaping?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.109
No, but I'm a fast learner.

06:42.610 --> 06:47.199
Um, okay, this question is not intended
to be in any way sexist,

06:48.116 --> 06:52.454
but it is a requirement of this workplace,
so don't be offended.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.622
What?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.210
Can you lift that bag?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.385
Where would you like it?

07:07.469 --> 07:09.596
Back on the pile's good.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.562
All right.
Come on in tomorrow.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.607
We'll get you all set up
and we'll see what you're made of.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.361
Um, I'll, uh... I'll be here at 6:00.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.031
Uh, okay, but everybody else
will be here at 7:00, so...

07:30.033 --> 07:31.451
Sounds good, Hank.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.874
Sit down, superstar.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.425
School called...

07:48.385 --> 07:50.762
and your mother wasn't here,
so I had to answer it.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.056
You skipped out on another test.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.766
I can explain.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.518
They're suspending you for a week.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.561
I understand.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.605
No, I don't think you do.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.565
Two of your teachers don't even
want you back in their class.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.317
Which means you don't have
enough credits to graduate.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.194
-I can make up the tests.
-No, you've already ditched

08:06.278 --> 08:08.405
too many of those.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.198
Your mother and I have decided

08:10.282 --> 08:12.742
that we're sending you
to a military boarding school.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.327
You're sending me away?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.163
Just for eight months. In Idaho.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.497
You can get your grades up,

08:17.580 --> 08:20.542
learn about responsibility,
and reapply to colleges next spring.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.335
I think we need to talk about this.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.422
Well, I'm sorry.
It's not up to you.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.051
Gary...

08:29.967 --> 08:31.761
Aren't we talking more?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.808
Gary!

09:23.605 --> 09:25.065
What the hell?

09:52.884 --> 09:55.387
<i>It's a combination</i>
<i>of digital and mechanical.</i>

09:55.470 --> 09:58.265
Not easy to bypass,
but definitely based on our tech.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.892
Well, I hope so,
considering how it was left in my car.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.979
I mean, no interface or remote signal?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.482
Trying that right now.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.444
You're right.
It definitely opens remotely.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.534
Maybe if I can...

10:17.617 --> 10:19.076
No. Shit!

10:20.370 --> 10:22.747
Uh, if I can use a proxy...
No, that's stupid, too.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.667
Hey.
If there's one thing you're not...

10:26.793 --> 10:29.129
I'm sorry, boss.
My head isn't clear.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.883
Look, if you need a little
to function properly, I won't stop you.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.009
No. No.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.262
I need to try
for at least a few more hours.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
Staying clean is harder than I thought.

10:41.808 --> 10:46.103
-How can I help?
-I'm getting help, actually.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.689
Support groups.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.316
My friend Ray has been taking me.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.027
A friend? Oh... Good.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.198
Well, can you scan it?
See what's inside?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.425
If this doesn't work,
I'll have to run a few programs,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.469
try and brute force a key code.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.770
The case is lined.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.399
They really wanted to keep it
a secret from you.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.318
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do with the damn thing,

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
other than keep it on me at all times.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.072
-The director must have a plan.
-Yeah.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.200
What else is new?

12:16.361 --> 12:17.445
Can I help you?

12:17.529 --> 12:20.323
Good morning, Mrs. MacLaren.
Do you have a moment to talk?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.575
-About what?
-Don't be alarmed.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.661
I'm actually here
about a personal matter.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.127
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:16.921
<i>Sorry, did... did I wake you?</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.631
No. It's okay.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.383
<i>Cool. Um...</i>

13:21.384 --> 13:23.052
<i>Anyway, I just wanted</i>
<i>to let you know</i>

13:23.135 --> 13:25.304
<i>when I was gonna be</i>
<i>around today...</i>

13:25.388 --> 13:28.391
<i>in case you needed help</i>
<i>getting your things.</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:32.812
<i>I mean, not that you need help</i>
<i>with your things, but if...</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:35.898
- if you did...
- I can help.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.525
Or I can not be around.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.362
You know, alternatively.

13:40.445 --> 13:44.198
<i>No. Uh... it'd be great if you were there,</i>
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

13:44.281 --> 13:47.159
-No! No, not at all.
<i>-Um...</i>

13:48.285 --> 13:49.746
When are you gonna be around?

13:49.829 --> 13:52.790
<i>I can be around all day, if that works.</i>

13:52.874 --> 13:56.753
Okay, well, uh,
I will see you this afternoon.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.212
<i>Okay.</i>

13:59.338 --> 14:01.215
-Okay.
<i>-Bye.</i>

14:24.406 --> 14:26.240
Good morning, 3468.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.951
-I'm here to brief you on your mission.
-You are...?

14:29.827 --> 14:32.747
3112. You can go now.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.171
Your target is Congressman Bishop.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.675
Target? What is that supposed to mean?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.677
That's the word
the messenger used.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.681
Bishop will be seated next to you...
in first class.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.265
1A and 1B.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.562
- This flight is today.
- Is that a problem?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.313
No, I just...

14:58.606 --> 15:01.609
To be honest, I've never been
in an aircraft before.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.861
Shouldn't I have luggage, or...

15:03.945 --> 15:06.072
-You have the case.
-Of course.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.239
That's all you need.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.116
Your credentials will get it
through security.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.367
It will open at the appropriate time,

15:10.452 --> 15:12.161
and you'll be made aware
of its purpose.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.246
I'm gonna need
a little more than that.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.457
I don't have more than that.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.002
If you wouldn't mind dropping me
off where I'm going.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.253
You do know I'm a federal agent?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.881
It's just a few more blocks.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.222
Good morning.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.389
I know I'm a bit early.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.308
I figured I'd get a head start on some--

15:34.391 --> 15:37.520
Carly, um,
our needs have actually changed,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.313
so I'm afraid we don't have
a job to offer you.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.399
Okay. Uh, well, if you wouldn't mind
keeping me in mind for the future--

15:42.484 --> 15:45.987
Um, we're never gonna be able
to offer you a job here, darling. Sorry.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.656
Why not?

15:49.532 --> 15:50.742
You know why.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.996
No, I don't, actually.
Sir, I really need this job.

15:55.079 --> 15:59.083
Our background check revealed
the charges on your record.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.711
Assaulting a police officer?
Come on, kiddo.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.589
You don't understand.
He's the father of my child.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.966
And that makes it better... how?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.643
You know, the 21st has this service
called Uber.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.435
You may want--

16:18.520 --> 16:20.480
It's my wife. Excuse me.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.690
- Hey, Kat.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

16:22.774 --> 16:24.776
On my way to the airport, apparently.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.111
<i>-We need to talk.</i>
-I can't right now.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.197
I've just been assigned escort duty to DC.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.743
The flight's at, uh... 1:30 today.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.328
<i>-You're leaving?</i>
-Yeah, it's just for one night.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.081
I'll call you as soon as I--

16:39.165 --> 16:40.207
Kat?

16:40.291 --> 16:41.918
At least you weren't ordered
to assassinate her.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.504
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

16:44.587 --> 16:48.633
I'm about to attend a funeral service.
What do you think it means?

16:48.716 --> 16:49.842
You can pull over here.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.567
You okay?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.443
The treatments help.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.487
How long have you been doing this?

17:10.572 --> 17:12.990
-Just a few weeks.
-So it's working?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.827
It controls the seizures.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.162
I'm just... buying a little time.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.997
I'm sorry.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.416
The director made a mistake
with both of us.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.669
I'm sorry because you've had to deal
with this all alone.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.963
You confided in me...

17:27.046 --> 17:28.881
and I've only been worrying
about my own problems.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.677
I've had help. David.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.679
He's been doing this?

17:34.762 --> 17:37.098
And drawing the CSF
I use to make the serum.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.017
He's more than capable, and...

17:41.352 --> 17:42.436
He cares for me.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.230
I thought he kicked you out.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.858
It's not like that.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.463
How's it coming?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.550
I'm having a hard time understanding

18:13.635 --> 18:15.511
how one plant is more important
than another,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.847
but I'm doing what you asked.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.516
We need to talk.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.687
Don't think I haven't noticed
that things are changing between us.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.607
You struck me...

18:28.816 --> 18:31.694
and now you're sending me away
to military school.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.820
Those changes?

18:32.904 --> 18:35.531
I'm talking about
since you quit football.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.742
-Since my concussion?
-I'm saying...

18:39.911 --> 18:41.871
There comes a time
in every young man's life

18:41.954 --> 18:43.915
when he stops putting his father
up on a pedestal

18:43.998 --> 18:44.999
and just sees him--

18:45.082 --> 18:47.168
As the man that he really is.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.963
Exactly. That guy.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.590
-Yeah.
-Look, I just...

18:54.341 --> 18:56.928
I just wanted to say, you know,
guy to guy, man to man...

18:57.887 --> 19:00.514
I'm sorry things have gone south
between us, and...

19:01.557 --> 19:03.017
I'm doing my best here.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.568
Oh, and, uh...

19:13.360 --> 19:15.780
you don't have to do that anymore.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.615
Your mother told me to do it
while she was away at her sister's.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.665
Gary?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.961
Is there golf on later today?

19:30.044 --> 19:31.545
One o'clock.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.089
Maybe we could watch it together.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.401
Here we go.
Give me a sec, guys.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.196
Carly, how can I help you?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.782
You can explain why a background check
by a potential employer

19:59.866 --> 20:01.033
showed an assault charge.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.536
Well, maybe it was after you punched me
in my face and stole my car.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.747
How many times have you struck me?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.123
You know, come to think of it,
maybe it was after

20:07.206 --> 20:10.292
you kicked me in my nuts
outside the babysitter's house.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.419
-A witness probably called it in.
-Right.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.504
Well, I'm sure someone inside

20:13.587 --> 20:16.173
will be interested in hearing
the other side of the story.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.259
They all know I'm a good family man.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.888
What do you want?

20:24.015 --> 20:25.224
I want us.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.978
-My son. My family.
-Oh, my God. All right, Jeff,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.731
I'm gonna let you in on a secret. Okay?

20:32.732 --> 20:36.068
That night you smashed my head
into the kitchen counter?

20:38.112 --> 20:39.530
You were gonna kill me.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.158
-What're you talking about?
-Let me tell you how.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.410
I was gonna open the kitchen drawer,

20:44.493 --> 20:46.203
to get out your spare gun
to defend myself,

20:46.287 --> 20:48.998
but you were going to be
too strong and too fast.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.752
The gun was gonna go off,
and I was going to bleed out on the floor.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.421
That is batshit crazy talk.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.548
Carly, you need help.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.927
What I needed was a decent job,

21:01.010 --> 21:02.845
and you just took that from me.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.438
Smooth.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.486
<i>Philip, you there?</i>

21:19.570 --> 21:22.156
-What's up, boss?
<i>-I'm heading out of town.</i>

21:22.239 --> 21:25.117
<i>I just received mission instructions</i>
<i>through another traveler.</i>

21:26.202 --> 21:28.871
Where do you want us?
I can be ready in five.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.208
No, this one's a solo assignment.
I'm flying to DC.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.252
I'll be out of com reach when the plane
gets above 20,000 feet...

21:35.336 --> 21:38.047
which is
a terrifying thought unto itself,

21:38.130 --> 21:39.631
but I'll check in by cell

21:39.715 --> 21:42.301
<i>once we're on the ground,</i>
<i>about 6:30 your time.</i>

21:42.384 --> 21:45.012
Statistically,
it is the safest way to travel.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.098
Well, strapped to a chair
moving through the sky,

21:47.181 --> 21:48.265
but thanks for trying.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.947
Good evening. Hello.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.243
-Oh. Hi.
-Mr. MacLaren. Perfect.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.453
And just to your right.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.290
Hi! Welcome.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.627
Perfect. And just down the aisle
to your right.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.630
Oh. Sorry.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.931
Sir? I can stow that
in the overhead compartment if you like.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.267
No, no, I'll keep it with me.
Thanks.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.188
Hi! Welcome.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.899
Perfect, sir, and just down the aisle
to your left.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.444
Hello. Mr. Bishop? Perfect.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.988
And just here to your right.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.157
Hi.

22:52.914 --> 22:55.041
Excuse me.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.507
What a day.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.093
Yeah. Same here.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.137
-I'm, uh...
-Excuse me.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.139
Jim?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.183
Yeah, it's me.
I'm on the plane now.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.392
Just left the funeral.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.938
Well, it was fine. It was a funeral.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.856
Yeah, you know I'm ready.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.277
I've already spoken with the board.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.696
Hayes' death shouldn't hold up
our plans at all.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.241
We'll get the bill signed,
have the pipeline flowing in no time.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.870
Okay, see you back in DC.
Bye.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.378
Okay.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.007
Mac?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.151
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Special Agent Grant MacLaren.</i>

24:04.235 --> 24:06.445
<i>- Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

24:07.446 --> 24:10.116
Hey, it's me. Um...

24:11.533 --> 24:12.994
I really need to talk to you.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.789
It's Jeff.
He is literally sabotaging my identity.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.793
I think you're the only one that can help.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.217
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:31.887
You'd think the executive class
would be more spacious, huh?

24:31.970 --> 24:35.266
Well, I don't really
have a frame of reference.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.019
-First time up front?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.189
Not a lot of difference at 35,000 feet.

24:42.273 --> 24:45.234
Same paper-thin aluminum tube
as back there.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.653
-Paper-thin?
-Oh, relax.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.196
You got a better chance
of being eaten by a shark

24:49.280 --> 24:50.739
than being in a plane crash.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.076
Well, then, I'm glad we're not flying
over water.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.202
Sir?

24:55.286 --> 24:57.163
Gonna have to ask you
to turn off your phone, please.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.665
I'm a US Congressman. It's fine.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.001
Well, it's a privilege
to have you onboard, Congressman,

25:03.085 --> 25:05.421
but we still need
you to turn off your phone, please.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.964
Once we're in the air,
you'll have full access to our wifi.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.383
Thank you.

25:11.052 --> 25:14.596
I tell you, not many perks
to positions of power these days.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.266
Front row.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.060
-What do you do?
-FBI.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.436
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.229
Ted Bishop.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.522
Should've known by the suit, right?

25:25.482 --> 25:26.775
I'm just kidding.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.861
So I guess you heard about
Secretary Hayes' death?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.281
Your division handling that?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.741
-We are.
-Well, good on you.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.536
Woop, we're off.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.330
Oh. Good.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.138
You said I needed help, and you're right.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.890
-I need help with our son.
-Right now?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.684
Call it a peace offering.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.394
Carly, I'm not stupid.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.355
And I'm not gonna play babysitter
every time--

26:04.438 --> 26:06.315
I have a couple of job interviews.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.234
I'm just gonna have to tell the truth
on the applications.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.611
See what happens.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.822
If you really want to start mending
this relationship, here's the chance.

26:15.657 --> 26:16.867
Hey?

26:20.036 --> 26:21.788
Hey, big guy.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.292
How much time do you need?

26:25.376 --> 26:27.711
How about you spend
a few hours with your son...

26:28.462 --> 26:29.713
see what it's like?

26:33.049 --> 26:34.343
Hey, hey, hey!

26:35.302 --> 26:37.263
Come on. You chill with Dad for a bit.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.597
Huh? Go for some ice cream?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.558
Play some <i>Space Kabob.</i>

26:42.768 --> 26:44.728
Shoot some guns?
I'm just joking.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.188
We're not gonna shoot no guns.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.989
Come in. Come on in.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.952
I, uh, I haven't packed up anything...
up for you,

27:01.036 --> 27:02.496
'cause I wasn't sure what you wanted.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.206
Oh, I don't have much stuff.

27:05.332 --> 27:09.044
Yeah, no, I was meaning more,
like, my stuff that you might need.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.962
I'm not taking your things, David.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.424
But why do I need
all this stuff for myself?

27:13.507 --> 27:15.884
I mean, do you have a kettle?

27:18.136 --> 27:22.849
'Cause everybody needs a kettle
for, like... tea.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.144
-So take it. I insist.
-Okay.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.905
This is...

27:39.074 --> 27:41.493
This is a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.996
Yeah, it's hard for me, too.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.582
-Is it?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.918
I don't know if that's possible, Marcy,
because I feel like I'm dying here.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.966
-What?
-Nothing.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.885
No, you were gonna say something.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.267
Thank you for the kettle.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.146
That's not it.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.233
What were you gonna say?
Tell me.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.070
I'm dying.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.660
You mean that you feel the same way?

28:26.204 --> 28:28.457
I do feel the same way, but...

28:31.627 --> 28:33.169
that's not what I'm saying.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.010
No.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.889
The seizures
that you've been helping me treat,

28:43.972 --> 28:46.308
those are... those are just symptoms.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.144
This is way too fucking much.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.230
Everything that we've been doing...

28:53.023 --> 28:54.441
has just been to buy time.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.904
I don't have that long.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.575
And you were just gonna leave?

29:03.659 --> 29:06.412
I don't want you to have to go
through all of that.

29:06.495 --> 29:10.040
What have I been telling you
about doing stuff alone?

29:10.123 --> 29:11.166
I mean, do you have any idea

29:11.250 --> 29:13.627
what that would've done to me,
knowing that I kicked you out?

29:19.007 --> 29:20.091
When?

29:26.390 --> 29:27.891
Not today.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.254
I could just hack in
and remove the charges.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.716
No, that won't do it.
He'll just refile.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.594
I need MacLaren to get involved,
use his FBI influence.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.179
He said he'd touch base
once he landed.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.556
Okay.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.433
1:30 for DC, right?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.692
Uh...

30:18.775 --> 30:20.777
Flight 329 to Washington.
It just took off.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.742
329... No.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.494
No, no, no, no, no.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.705
No... no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.164
What?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.254
Marcy?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.923
<i>-We have a problem.</i>
-Copy.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.095
Copy what?

31:01.527 --> 31:03.612
<i>Trevor,</i>
<i>we have a problem.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:06.907
Copy that.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.418
Um, uh, excuse me.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.795
-I, uh, gotta take a leak.
-Oh.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.087
Sure.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.117
Kat?
What are you doing here?

31:51.201 --> 31:53.787
Oh, God. Grant, I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.330
What?

31:56.707 --> 31:59.543
I thought I was gonna find you
on here with another woman,

31:59.626 --> 32:01.545
and then I saw you talking
to that man up front,

32:01.628 --> 32:03.422
and I realized that I made a--

32:03.505 --> 32:07.050
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>your captain from the flight deck.</i>

32:07.133 --> 32:10.095
<i>Uh, we've just entered</i>
<i>an unexpected area of turbulence.</i>

32:10.178 --> 32:12.473
<i>Please return to your seats</i>
<i>and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

32:13.640 --> 32:15.684
For Christ's sake, Kathryn, I'm working.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.978
A police officer came to our house
this morning

32:18.061 --> 32:20.271
and said that you're sleeping
with his wife.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.940
What? That's--

32:22.023 --> 32:24.776
He told me her name and said that
he's seen you leaving their house.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.069
Sir, we need you to take your seat.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.446
-Just a second.
-No, now, sir.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.405
I'm a federal agent.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.741
Well, I'm a flight attendant!

32:30.824 --> 32:33.368
Go back to your seat!
I'm not asking again.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.412
Grant, it's fine.
We can talk later. Just go.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.639
This is nothing. Don't worry.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.270
Guys, can you hear me?

33:03.189 --> 33:05.316
It's Mac. Can anybody hear me?

33:08.194 --> 33:09.863
Boss, can you hear us?

33:09.946 --> 33:12.365
The plane hasn't descended
far enough yet.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.409
<i>Anybody?</i>
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

33:14.493 --> 33:16.369
Yeah. We can hear you.
Is everything okay?

33:16.453 --> 33:19.080
<i>No. No, I think we're descending.</i>

33:19.164 --> 33:20.541
Has the case opened yet?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.459
Uh, not... not yet.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.755
Philip, what can you tell me
about this flight?

33:29.591 --> 33:33.344
I didn't realize this was your flight
until it was too late.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.640
Flight 329 to Washington
goes down at 2:53 p.m.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.224
<i>on this day.</i>

33:43.354 --> 33:44.523
Are there any survivors?

33:44.606 --> 33:45.774
Boss...

33:45.857 --> 33:49.069
all 141 people onboard die.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.167
Bet you wish you had that free drink.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.627
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>your captain again.</i>

34:05.711 --> 34:07.713
<i>One of our gauges is acting up over here,</i>

34:07.796 --> 34:10.841
<i>probably nothing, but, uh,</i>
<i>we've begun a slow turn.</i>

34:12.092 --> 34:13.594
Christ. Have we turned around?

34:13.677 --> 34:15.470
I have to be in Washington by 4:00.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.931
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Jesus, you smell that?

34:19.349 --> 34:20.767
What is that?

34:20.851 --> 34:23.478
<i>Lithium batteries</i>
<i>catch fire in the cargo hold.</i>

34:23.562 --> 34:25.230
- Something's burning.
- What?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.232
How does it go down?

34:27.315 --> 34:30.360
The plane's already descending
and has made a slow turn back,

34:30.443 --> 34:31.570
but doesn't make it.

34:31.653 --> 34:32.779
<i>Tell me how to stop it.</i>

34:32.863 --> 34:35.991
Tell the pilot you need
to depressurize and climb.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.784
Sir, if you don't sit down right now...

34:37.868 --> 34:40.954
Tell the Captain we need to depressurize
and start climbing.

34:42.497 --> 34:43.582
Captain, there's smoke in the cabin!

34:43.665 --> 34:45.584
<i>The fire's burned</i>
<i>through the cargo liner.</i>

34:45.667 --> 34:47.127
<i>Flight systems will</i>
<i>eventually fail.</i>

34:49.545 --> 34:50.881
Excuse me.
Do you know...

34:50.964 --> 34:52.716
<i>It's too late to stop it.</i>

34:52.799 --> 34:55.093
Well, I'm pretty sure it is
my mission to save this plane.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.304
Don't tell me... Wait.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.764
Stand by.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.068
Grant! What's happening?

35:12.152 --> 35:13.403
Grant!

35:20.744 --> 35:23.079
-What the hell are you doing?
-I have my mission.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.874
Trevor, you need to tell me how to make
a two-person stasis field

35:25.957 --> 35:27.042
hold more than two people.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.795
- Who's Trevor?
<i>- Those things use a ton of power.</i>

35:29.878 --> 35:31.129
What is that thing?
Who are you talking to?

35:31.212 --> 35:33.589
Just shut up for a second!
Find a way.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.425
This is why you were
kept in the dark on this one.

35:35.508 --> 35:36.592
<i>What do you mean?</i>

35:36.677 --> 35:38.594
We keep improvising.

35:38.679 --> 35:41.097
The director must have known
you'd try and save everyone on the plane.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.016
<i>You can't do it, boss.</i>

35:43.975 --> 35:47.353
I'm not trying to save everyone,
I'm trying to save my wife,

35:47.437 --> 35:49.898
<i>who decided to surprise me mid-air.</i>

35:49.981 --> 35:52.776
I'm talking about three people.
There has to be a way.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.781
<i>Stand by.</i>

36:00.450 --> 36:02.493
A stasis field means
he's going to need resuscitation.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.954
Yeah, I know,
I'm prepared for that, but--

36:04.037 --> 36:06.289
Wife's not on the
manifest, same with MacLaren.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.457
They've already been scrubbed.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.668
- By who?
- Why does it matter?

36:09.751 --> 36:12.295
Because technically none of us
were given this mission.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.547
And we keep improvising,
and in case you haven't noticed,

36:14.630 --> 36:17.092
the future doesn't seem to like it
when we do that.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.094
Mac's in trouble!
We're not turning back!

36:20.846 --> 36:23.223
Tell me what the hell's going on.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.641
-There's a fire in the cargo hold.
-What?

36:25.726 --> 36:28.103
We're gonna get through this,
but you have to listen to me

36:28.186 --> 36:29.645
and do exactly as I tell you.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.191
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we've had a small fire in our cargo hold.</i>

36:33.274 --> 36:35.819
<i>The fire suppression system has activated.</i>

36:35.902 --> 36:38.571
<i>I'm confident we'll be fine,</i>
<i>but as a matter of caution,</i>

36:38.654 --> 36:40.573
<i>we are performing an emergency descent.</i>

36:40.656 --> 36:43.118
Look at me. Look at me.
The captain's wrong.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.370
This plane is gonna crash
and nothing can stop that now.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.122
-Oh, my God.
-But I have a device.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.374
- What?
- This box...

36:49.457 --> 36:52.335
can generate an energy field
that will temporarily

36:52.418 --> 36:54.295
hold our bodies in stasis
during the crash

36:54.379 --> 36:55.964
and throw us clear of the debris field.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.423
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.633
No, we're not gonna die.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.426
-Go ahead.
-Who the fuck are you talking to?

37:00.510 --> 37:02.220
<i>I ran the numbers back to front.</i>

37:02.303 --> 37:05.390
<i>There's no way the stasis field generator</i>
<i>can expand to fit three people.</i>

37:05.473 --> 37:06.892
We have to try.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.895
Don't! It's a question of mass.
Even two people is gonna be a stretch,

37:09.978 --> 37:12.605
considering your angle of impact
and velocity.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.192
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>We can't save her.</i>

37:16.276 --> 37:19.279
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we need to prepare for emergency landing.</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:21.782
<i>We have approximately five minutes</i>
<i>to prepare the cabin for landing,</i>

37:21.865 --> 37:23.616
<i>so undivided attention is very important.</i>

37:35.796 --> 37:37.088
Five minutes!

37:39.132 --> 37:41.384
<i>...require you to open a door,</i>

37:41.467 --> 37:43.719
<i>immediately pull</i>
<i>the red inflation handle</i>

37:43.803 --> 37:47.098
<i>located at the base of the door</i>
<i>to ensure proper slide inflation.</i>

37:47.182 --> 37:48.558
Okay. It's time.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.020
The seatbelt sign is on, sir!

37:52.103 --> 37:54.439
Don't try to stop me.
Please.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.149
Come on. Now.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.151
I'm not going anywhere with you.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.445
Every other person on this plane
is gonna die today.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.531
But you, for some reason, get to live,
so be humble and grateful,

38:03.614 --> 38:06.284
and get your ass out of that seat
before I drag it out.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.874
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we will not make the airport.</i>

38:12.958 --> 38:14.793
<i>We'll be making an emergency landing.</i>

38:14.876 --> 38:17.796
<i>- When I give the command "brace, brace"...</i>

38:17.879 --> 38:20.048
<i>...assume the position</i>
<i>the crew has demonstrated</i>

38:20.131 --> 38:22.175
<i>until the plane comes</i>
<i>to a complete stop.</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:23.343
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:26.930 --> 38:27.973
What are you doing?

38:29.182 --> 38:30.350
<i>Before we brace</i>
<i>for landing...</i>

38:30.433 --> 38:32.685
-Back in your seats, now!
-Grant? Where are you going?

38:32.768 --> 38:35.897
<i>...face down in your lap,</i>
<i>and wrap your arms underneath your knees.</i>

38:35.981 --> 38:38.566
<i>If you are unable to assume this position,</i>

38:38.649 --> 38:40.735
<i>cross your wrists and place them</i>
<i>on the seat back in front of you.</i>

38:41.694 --> 38:43.363
<i>Rest your forehead on the seat back.</i>

38:43.446 --> 38:45.907
<i>Children should lean forward,</i>
<i>feet flat on the floor...</i>

38:45.991 --> 38:47.742
-Sit here.
<i>-...heads facedown in laps,</i>

38:47.826 --> 38:49.494
<i>and wrap their arms</i>
<i>underneath their knees.</i>

38:49.577 --> 38:51.537
Stay calm, and we're gonna be all right.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.664
I don't think I believe you anymore.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.291
It doesn't matter if you do or not.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.878
Just do as I say when I say it.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.839
- Philip?
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

39:01.756 --> 39:03.216
Tell me about the crash site.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.509
Uh...

39:05.468 --> 39:07.762
They lose control of flight surfaces
any moment now

39:07.846 --> 39:09.722
from fire damage below.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.017
So it comes in steep
and hits in the middle of a field.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.769
<i>- There isn't much left, but, uh...</i>

39:14.853 --> 39:15.854
But what?

39:15.937 --> 39:18.023
The tail section is the only part
of the plane left intact

39:18.106 --> 39:20.191
in every picture in historical record.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.363
So someone could survive
if they were in the tail section?

39:25.446 --> 39:28.283
No! That's not what he said!
The G-forces would be huge!

39:28.366 --> 39:30.118
- Thank you.
<i>- You can't!</i>

39:30.201 --> 39:31.619
You don't have time to save her!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.082
- Stay here.
- You're leaving me?

39:36.166 --> 39:37.750
I'll be right back.
Don't move.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.465
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

39:47.843 --> 39:49.137
Sir, sit down!

39:53.892 --> 39:56.019
Sorry I took so long.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.314
Wait. Where are we going?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.441
You were not supposed to be
on this flight.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.901
I know, I'm sorry.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.277
So I'm improvising.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.448
Come on.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.036
Traveler 3468,
you are off mission.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.414
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.170
Grant, what did she say?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.714
-What was she talking about?
-Just stay with me.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.055
- Here.
- Who the hell is this?

40:32.138 --> 40:33.014
This is my wife.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.766
She's gonna use the device
with you instead of me.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.184
- What device?
- Just...

40:36.267 --> 40:38.103
Here, hold this tight
and get close to each other.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.438
Come on. Closer. Closer.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.440
Whatever you do,
don't let go of each other.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.442
Do you understand?
No, I don't understand.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.651
Just trust me and listen.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.487
When that light flashes red,
press it down.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.530
You hold it down, okay?
That's all you have to do.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.324
-No! Why can't you? Where are you going?
-You can do this.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.825
No! Don't go!

40:55.036 --> 40:56.955
You're gonna be okay.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.215
Forty-five seconds.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.428
We see you coming in. Good luck.

41:59.309 --> 42:01.769
Heads down! Stay down!

42:01.852 --> 42:03.438
Brace! Brace!

42:04.189 --> 42:07.233
Brace! Brace! Brace! Brace!

43:06.251 --> 43:07.460
We need to separate them!

43:08.753 --> 43:09.754
Get her shirt.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.175
Where is he?

43:21.349 --> 43:22.558
Clear?

43:25.019 --> 43:26.271
Oh, goddamn him!

43:28.689 --> 43:30.816
Clear?

43:33.403 --> 43:35.363
He put himself in the tail.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.038
- Hi.
- We made it.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.292
-We actually made it!
-Hi. It's okay.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.294
-It's okay.
-Where's Grant?

43:49.377 --> 43:51.504
That son of a bitch was telling the truth.

43:54.507 --> 43:55.883
Grant!

43:55.966 --> 43:57.302
Where's Grant?

43:58.969 --> 44:00.471
- Grant?
- Oh!

44:30.042 --> 44:32.462
You're not the EMT team I was expecting.

44:32.545 --> 44:34.547
I'm Traveler 3569.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.091
3326.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.678
Welcome to the 21st.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.268
Oh, shit...

44:47.352 --> 44:48.811
- Wait.
- How'd they get here so fast?

44:48.894 --> 44:50.438
-No! No!
-Wait! Wait!

44:50.521 --> 44:52.398
Carly, no!
We're not supposed to be here!

44:52.482 --> 44:55.109
Let go of me!
Let go! No! Let...
