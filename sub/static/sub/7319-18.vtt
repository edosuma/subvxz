WEBVTT

00:11.967 --> 00:16.400
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
I'M GETTING MARRIED TO BURKE.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.400
OUCH.
I WENT TO THE BOARD
THIS MORNING

00:18.433 --> 00:20.267
AND TOLD THEM I WAS RETIRING.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.700
ONE OF US COULD BE CHIEF.

00:21.733 --> 00:23.200
WE WERE HERE LONG BEFORE
YOU AND GEORGE

00:23.233 --> 00:24.533
STARTED FOOLING AROUND.
HE IS MY HUSBAND.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.800
STOP SAYING THAT
LIKE IT MEANS SOMETHING.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.700
(Alex) JANE DOE,
ABOUT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.

00:28.733 --> 00:31.267
FOUND UNDER A PILE OF RUBBLE.
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
FROM BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.667
GO 60 DAYS WITH NO SEX,
NO OTHER WOMEN.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.500
MY MOTHER'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?
YES.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.433
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
AND FIGHT FOR US?

00:38.467 --> 00:40.467
I-I TRIED.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.067
ALEX, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.833
***

00:47.867 --> 00:50.033
(water running)

00:50.067 --> 00:51.400
(Meredith) PEOPLE HAVE SCARS

00:51.433 --> 00:53.467
IN ALL SORTS
OF UNEXPECTED PLACES,

00:53.500 --> 00:56.633
LIKE SECRET ROAD MAPS
OF THEIR PERSONAL HISTORIES,

00:56.667 --> 00:59.633
DIAGRAMS OF ALL
THEIR OLD WOUNDS.

00:59.667 --> 01:03.067
ALEX! GOD.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.067
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SEEN IT ALL BEFORE.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.800
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:06.833 --> 01:09.067
MOVING IN.
WHAT?

01:09.100 --> 01:11.067
MOST OF OUR OLD WOUNDS HEAL,

01:11.100 --> 01:13.100
LEAVING NOTHING BEHIND
BUT A SCAR.

01:13.133 --> 01:15.433
BUT SOME OF THEM DON'T.
ALEX IS MOVING IN?

01:15.467 --> 01:17.400
TO THIS HOUSE?

01:17.433 --> 01:18.700
HE'S TAKING GEORGE'S ROOM.
WHY?

01:18.733 --> 01:20.667
I WAS ASLEEP
JUST A MINUTE AGO.
YEAH.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.600
AND I WAS NAKED IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN ALEX WALKED IN.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.467
I'M LUCKY I DIDN'T COME OUT
OF THE SHOWER TO FIND HIM

01:25.500 --> 01:27.400
PEEING ALL OVER THE SEAT.
AND WE'RE UP.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH WHERE
HE WAS LIVING BEFORE?

01:29.367 --> 01:32.100
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE WAS LIVING BEFORE.
PROBABLY A WHOREHOUSE.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.167
I CAN'T HAVE HIM LIVING
IN THE ROOM RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.633
IT'S WEIRD.
PEOPLE ARE WHAT MATTERS.
ALEX IS ONE OF OUR PEOPLE.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.800
WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM OUT
IN THE COLD.
"PEOPLE ARE WHAT MATTERS"?

01:38.833 --> 01:41.433
YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE.
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

01:41.467 --> 01:42.700
NO.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.567
I HAD A NEAR DEATH WHATEVER,
AND... I WAS DEAD.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.267
AND NOW I'M NOT.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.433
SO I'D LIKE TO USE
THIS CHANCE I'VE BEEN GIVEN

01:48.467 --> 01:50.300
TO BE MORE POSITIVE.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.767
PEOPLE ARE WHAT MATTERS.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.533
PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS
OF THE WIND.

01:55.567 --> 01:57.567
OH. OKAY.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.667
YOU'RE CRAZY NOW.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.067
(laughs) I'M ALIVE.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.567
YEAH, OKAY.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.733
NO, NO. UM, I'M NOT DONE
IN THERE YET.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.533
OH, DON'T WORRY.

02:05.567 --> 02:07.400
NOT LOOKING, NOT INTERESTED.

02:07.433 --> 02:09.467
SOME WOUNDS WE CARRY
WITH US EVERYWHERE,

02:09.500 --> 02:11.400
AND THOUGH THE CUT'S
LONG GONE...

02:11.433 --> 02:13.333
NO, SHE'S SELFISH,
IS IZZIE'S PROBLEM.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.700
THE PAIN STILL LINGERS.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.333
SHE'S NOT SELFISH.
SHE'S GENEROUS.

02:16.367 --> 02:19.133
BUT... SHE--
SHE'S SELF-ABSORBED.

02:19.167 --> 02:20.500
I MEAN, HER PROBLEM IS

02:20.533 --> 02:23.400
THAT SHE DOESN'T SEE
OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.267
HEY, GIVE ME A BITE.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.600
MMM.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.867
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD

02:28.900 --> 02:31.233
BECAUSE SHE'S SO RIDICULOUSLY
COMPASSIONATE WITH HER PATIENTS.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.433
YOU'D THINK SHE'D ROLL SOME
OF THAT OUT FOR HER FRIENDS,

02:33.467 --> 02:34.800
BUT NOT THE WAY--

02:34.833 --> 02:36.767
HOW ABOUT WE NOT TALK
ABOUT HER ANYMORE?

02:36.800 --> 02:38.600
THAT'S A FINE IDEA.

02:38.633 --> 02:41.533
***

02:44.467 --> 02:45.800
HE IS IN GEORGE'S ROOM,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.767
AND WHEN GEORGE'S STUPID
MARRIAGE CRASHES AND BURNS,

02:47.800 --> 02:49.733
HE'S GONNA WANT TO MOVE BACK IN,
AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.667
HIS LIFE WILL BE
IN A SHAMBLES,

02:51.700 --> 02:53.600
HE'LL FINALLY NOTICE
THAT HIS DAD IS DEAD

02:53.633 --> 02:55.467
AND HE MADE
A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF

02:55.500 --> 02:57.133
BY MARRYING SOMEBODY
HE DOESN'T REALLY LOVE,

02:57.167 --> 03:00.800
AND HE'LL HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

03:00.833 --> 03:03.167
HEY, LOOK WHO FOUND
SOME CLOTHES.
SHUT IT.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.167
HOW YOU DOING?

03:05.200 --> 03:06.667
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S DO THIS ONCE.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.700
I'M FINE, SHE'S CREMATED,
I PICKED OUT A BEAUTIFUL URN,

03:09.733 --> 03:12.167
AND SHE'S HANGING OUT
IN THE BACK OF MY CLOSET.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.333
ANY MORE QUESTIONS
ABOUT MY DEAD MOTHER,

03:14.367 --> 03:16.467
OR CAN WE GET BACK TO WORK?
OKAY.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.167
(Cristina) DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHO THE NEW CHIEF CANDIDATE IS?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.333
THE CHIEF'S BRINGING IN A RINGER
IN CASE HE DOESN'T WANT

03:21.367 --> 03:24.233
TO GIVE THE JOB
TO EITHER OF YOUR BOYFRIENDS.
O'MALLEY,
YOU'RE WITH SHEPHERD TODAY.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.233
YANG, DR. MONTGOMERY.
STEVENS, TO THE CLINIC.

03:26.267 --> 03:28.500
KAREV, JANE DOE.
GREY, SCUT.
ONCE AGAIN, I AM FINE.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.833
YOU CAN TELL EVERYBODY YOU FINE
TILL YOU'RE BLUE IN YOUR FACE.

03:30.867 --> 03:32.767
YOUR MOM DIED,
AND YOU ALMOST JOINED HER.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.400
YOU'RE TAKING IT EASY.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.533
ANYBODY COME LOOKING
FOR ME YET?

03:37.567 --> 03:39.400
WELL, NO MATCH
ON YOUR PRINTS, NO.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.567
NO HITS FROM
MISSING PERSONS, PLUS--

03:41.600 --> 03:43.800
MY FACE IS HARD
TO IDENTIFY.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.700
WELL, THE SECOND
THEY FIND SOMETHING OUT

03:45.733 --> 03:48.267
ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY,
I'M GONNA COME TELL YOU.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.467
DR. SLOAN SAYS
I NEED SURGERY ON MY EYE.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.100
WELL, HE JUST WANTS
TO MAKE SURE

03:52.133 --> 03:54.067
YOU DON'T LOSE
VISION THERE COMPLETELY.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.833
BUT DR. MONTGOMERY SAYS
I SHOULD WAIT A DAY OR TWO

03:55.867 --> 03:57.500
'CAUSE OF THE BABY.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.700
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO MAKE OF THAT.

03:59.733 --> 04:02.200
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, SURGERY
CAN BE HARD ON A BABY,

04:02.233 --> 04:05.100
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE ON
A FETAL MONITOR THE WHOLE TIME,

04:05.133 --> 04:07.067
SO IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
WE'LL CATCH IT.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.400
THANK YOU.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.833
I REALLY--I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU TAKING THE TIME TO...

04:11.867 --> 04:13.767
I MEAN, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT

04:13.800 --> 04:15.133
IN THIS PLACE.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.833
(Izzie) DOES THAT HURT?

04:16.867 --> 04:19.700
OF COURSE IT HURTS.
DON'T POKE IT LIKE THAT.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.733
HAS THE LUMP BEEN THERE
A LONG TIME?

04:21.767 --> 04:25.267
I GOT SHOT 50 YEARS AGO.
IT'S BEEN THERE A LONG TIME.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.167
BUT IT HASN'T BOTHERED YOU
TILL... RECENTLY?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.100
IT BOTHERS ME
THERE'S A BULLET IN THERE.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.700
IT'D BOTHER YOU, TOO,

04:30.733 --> 04:33.233
BUT IT DIDN'T START HURTING
TILL A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.600
YOU THINK IT'S A BULLET?

04:34.633 --> 04:36.233
I DON'T "THINK," LADY.
I KNOW.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.767
I WANTED IT OUT,

04:37.800 --> 04:40.833
BUT THE ARMY DOCTORS
DIDN'T WANT TO GO GET IT.

04:40.867 --> 04:44.267
SO THEY LET ME KEEP IT IN
FOR HALF A LIFETIME.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.267
WELL...
LET'S GET SOME PICTURES,

04:47.300 --> 04:49.100
SEE IF YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.267
I KNOW I'M RIGHT.
SAVE YOUR FILM.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.100
JUST GET ME SOMETHING
FOR THE PAIN.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.300
MR. SCOFIELD,
I'M SURE YOU ARE RIGHT,

04:56.333 --> 05:00.133
BUT WE'RE STILL
GONNA DO THIS MY WAY.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.100
DEREK.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.467
THERE SHE IS.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.800
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

05:03.833 --> 05:06.300
THEY DIDN'T FEED ME,
WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.767
DR. O'MALLEY,
DR. CRAWFORD.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.567
SHE'S A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS.
PLEASURE.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.100
HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE WE WORKED
TOGETHER IN NEW YORK,

05:13.133 --> 05:16.433
AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO NEVER HAD A CRUSH ON HIM.
NO, I-I DON'T BUY THAT.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.800
WHAT DO WE KNOW, O'MALLEY?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.667
DR. CRAWFORD HAS
A PARAFALCINE MENINGIOMA

05:19.700 --> 05:21.600
ALONG THE SUPERIOR
SAGITTAL SINUS.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.533
YOU'VE OPERATED THREE TIMES.
IT KEEPS ON COMING BACK.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.067
YEAH, IT'S IN
DANGEROUS TERRITORY,

05:25.100 --> 05:27.467
SO WE LEAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF THE TUMOR BEHIND EACH TIME,

05:27.500 --> 05:29.733
AND WE GO BACK EVERY COUPLE
OF YEARS AND, UH, TUNE IT UP.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.700
BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME.
SORRY?

05:31.733 --> 05:34.200
THIS IS IT, DEREK.
I'M DONE AFTER THIS.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.300
HELEN...

05:37.333 --> 05:39.733
THE RECOVERY TAKES FOREVER,

05:39.767 --> 05:42.200
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WHEN JAKE WAS AROUND.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.267
I GO THROUGH THIS
BY MYSELF NOW.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.800
DON'T THROW IN THE TOWEL.

05:45.833 --> 05:48.533
I'M LOOKING
AT THE SITUATION AS IT IS.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.467
I AM GOING TO DO THIS NOW,

05:50.500 --> 05:53.733
THEN I AM GOING TO SPEND
THE NEXT TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE

05:53.767 --> 05:56.567
LYING ON A BEACH,
ENJOYING THE SUN.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.100
HELEN...

05:58.133 --> 06:00.433
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I KILLED YOUR CAT.

06:00.467 --> 06:03.100
THE DECISION IS MADE.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.067
YOU GUYS SEEN BAILEY?

06:11.067 --> 06:13.700
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:13.733 --> 06:16.667
(George) CHECKING OUT
THE NEW CHIEF CANDIDATE.
(Meredith) CHIEF'S IN
WITH THE RINGER.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.533
WE'RE LURKING IN A WAY THAT WAS
SUBTLE WHEN IT WAS TWO OF US,

06:19.567 --> 06:22.167
BUT ISN'T NOW THAT IT'S 12.
(Cristina) I HEARD IT WAS
SOMEONE FROM STANFORD.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.167
ALL THE PROFESSORS THERE
LOVED ME.
THEY LOVED YOU?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.467
I WAS A GREAT STUDENT.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.267
(Preston)
HOW YOU DOING, GREY?
OH, I'M FINE, SIR. THANK YOU.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.167
(Cristina) MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.
SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
WHEN PEOPLE ASK.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.700
THE RINGER'S IN THERE
WITH THE CHIEF.

06:32.733 --> 06:34.633
YEAH, AND WHOEVER IT IS
LOVES CRISTINA

06:34.667 --> 06:36.800
BECAUSE EVERYONE AT STANFORD
JUST LOVED CRISTINA.
SHUT UP.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.133
SHE'S A MOTIVATED STUDENT.
THAT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.100
THANK YOU.
A BIT OF A KISS ASS,

06:41.133 --> 06:43.267
BUT THAT'S HARD TO CONTROL.
(laughter)

06:43.300 --> 06:45.400
OH, THEY'RE COMING OUT.
LOOK AWAY.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.433
(both speaking indistinctly)

06:47.467 --> 06:49.300
THAT'S COLIN MARLOWE.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.300
(Alex) LIKE
THE MARLOWE TRANSPLANT?

06:51.333 --> 06:53.200
LIKE THE BRIGHTEST THING
IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

06:53.233 --> 06:55.567
IN A GENERATION.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.600
UH, DR. MARLOWE...
I'M, UH, PRESTON BURKE.

06:57.633 --> 06:59.633
I'M A GREAT ADMIRER
OF YOUR WORK, SIR.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.100
UH, PARTICULARLY THE--
YES, THANK YOU. I--

07:02.133 --> 07:05.067
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST A SECOND?

07:09.233 --> 07:11.267
WELL...

07:11.300 --> 07:13.600
YOU GONNA GIVE ME A HUG
OR WHAT?

07:35.733 --> 07:37.400
SO WHAT WAS THAT, EXACTLY?

07:37.433 --> 07:39.067
HE WAS MY PROFESSOR.
WE WERE CLOSE.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.233
WELL, "CLOSE" APPEARS TO BE
SOMETHING OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

07:42.267 --> 07:45.133
I TALK ABOUT HIM ALL THE TIME.
YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO MENTION IT?

07:45.167 --> 07:47.400
WELL, UM, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WANTED TO HEAR

07:47.433 --> 07:49.300
ABOUT EVERY GUY
I EVER SLEPT WITH.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.233
I HAVE A HYSTERECTOMY
TO PREP.

07:51.267 --> 07:54.500
ARE WE DONE
WITH THE CURIOSITY? GREAT.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

07:56.067 --> 07:58.367
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
AND FIND ALEX THERE,

07:58.400 --> 08:00.267
AND IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US,
YOU KNOW?

08:00.300 --> 08:02.200
AND IT'S WEIRD AND AWKWARD,
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW

08:02.233 --> 08:05.100
WHETHER HE SHOULD TALK TO ME
OR NOT TALK TO ME.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.833
(mouth full) IT'S JUST SUCH
AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.767
I'D RATHER IT BE GROUP
AWKWARDNESS, YOU KNOW?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.267
I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE STANDING
THERE STARING AT HIM. MEREDITH?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.733
HEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN MONTGOMERY?
NO.

08:13.767 --> 08:16.100
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
YOU WANT TO COME OVER?

08:16.133 --> 08:18.800
'CAUSE YOU AND I NEVER REALLY
GET A CHANCE TO HANG OUT AND...
(pager beeps)

08:18.833 --> 08:20.667
IT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.767
ALEX JUST MOVED IN, WHICH WAS
MEREDITH'S BRILLIANT IDEA.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.133
AND HE STILL HAS A THING FOR ME,
SO IT'S... WHAT THE HELL?

08:25.167 --> 08:27.333
THIS IS MY HIDING SPOT.
MY FATHER IS OUT THERE.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.433
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
I NEED THIS CLOSET, MEREDITH.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.400
COLIN MARLOWE?
YES, HE WAS MY PROFESSOR.
WE WERE CLOSE.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.667
HE HAD HIS HAND ON YOUR ASS.
I SURE HOPE YOU WERE CLOSE.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.800
DID YOU SEE SOMEBODY
GO IN THERE?
I DID.
SOMEONE'S HIDING FROM ME.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.433
YES, I THINK SOMEONE'S
HIDING FROM ME, TOO.

08:38.467 --> 08:39.800
YOU WERE THAT GIRL, HUH?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.733
THE GIRL WHO SLEPT WITH
THE PROFESSOR.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.700
WE HAD ONE IN MY CLASS.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.500
SHE ONLY GOT TO
THE RADIOLOGIST, THOUGH.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.667
NO ONE GOT NEAR
THE CARDIO GOD.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.533
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I SCORED BIG.
YOU KNOW, HIDE IN THE BATHROOM.

08:49.567 --> 08:52.300
MY AWKWARDNESS WITH MY FATHER
IS WELL-ESTABLISHED.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.433
YOU AND THE CARDIO GOD,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

08:54.467 --> 08:58.100
HAVE LOADS TO CATCH UP ON.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO THE CARDIO GOD.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.767
(Colin) YOU KNOW WE CAN
HEAR YOU IN THERE, RIGHT?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.467
LOUD AND CLEAR.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.367
(clears throat)

09:05.400 --> 09:07.633
OH. HI.

09:07.667 --> 09:08.600
HI.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.300
EXCUSE ME.
YEAH.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.433
MAY I?
OH, I WAS JUST LEAVING,
ACTUALLY.

09:13.467 --> 09:16.333
WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.
I'M SO SORRY.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.067
THANK YOU.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.800
THERE WASN'T A FUNERAL
OR ANYTHING?
OH, SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.733
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY
WITH THE BABY.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.700
OH, WE'RE NOT HERE
WITH THE BABY.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.767
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

09:26.800 --> 09:28.300
THAT YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.800
OH, WELL, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.733
I'M NOT IN SHOCK.
I'M NOT RACKED WITH GRIEF.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.333
I'M JUST MOVING ON.
BUT YOU'RE HIDING
IN A BROOM CLOSET.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.167
WELL, IF YOU COULD
JUST MOVE MY FATHER...

09:37.200 --> 09:39.100
I SENT HIM
TO GO GET SOME COFFEE,

09:39.133 --> 09:40.467
BUT WE'D REALLY LIKE TO...

09:40.500 --> 09:43.700
YOU KNOW, MAKE DINNER
OR SOMETHING... FOR YOU.

09:43.733 --> 09:46.100
HE'S BEEN REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.433
AND HE'S THE FAMILY
YOU HAVE LEFT, MEREDITH.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.367
I-I DON'T SEE IT
THAT WAY.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.667
OH, WHEN IS THIS GONNA STOP?

09:52.700 --> 09:55.733
YES, HE MADE SOME MISTAKES,
BUT HE'S NOT A MONSTER.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.267
HE'S JUST...
AN INARTICULATE PERSON

09:58.300 --> 10:00.433
WHO SPILLS FOOD
ON HIS SHIRT, A LOT.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.667
HAVE DINNER WITH US, TONIGHT.
I'LL MAKE SOME CHILI.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.200
THE WHOLE THING WILL BE OVER
IN AN HOUR.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.133
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

10:08.167 --> 10:10.433
(Colin) I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HID IN A CLOSET

10:10.467 --> 10:12.367
WHEN YOU SAW ME COMING.
IF IT WASN'T JUST TRAGIC,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.300
IT MIGHT BE THE MOST
ADORABLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.667
YOU COULD'VE WARNED ME.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.567
I THOUGHT, CRISTINA YANG
WOULDN'T HIDE IN A CLOSET

10:17.600 --> 10:19.500
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

10:19.533 --> 10:21.433
WHICH CLEARLY SHE DOESN'T
BECAUSE SHE FLED

10:21.467 --> 10:23.367
LIKE A ROACH IN SUNLIGHT
WHEN SHE SAW ME COMING.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
YOU KNOW, I DID NOT FLEE.
I WAS--I HAVE WORK TO DO.

10:25.033 --> 10:28.133
I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL
NOTE TAKER ANYMORE.
YOU GREW YOUR HAIR.
IT'S LOVELY.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.300
DON'T FLIRT WITH ME.
I HAVE A PERSON.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.533
REALLY? WHO?
PRESTON BURKE.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.133
(laughs) YOU NEVER CHANGE.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.600
MUST BE ADORABLE.
NO. SHUT UP.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.667
IT IS A REAL RELATIONSHIP.
I BET IT IS.

10:38.700 --> 10:41.133
I'M MARRYING HIM.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.600
OH... GOOD.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.300
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.767
NO, I'M BEING GENUINE.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.400
IT'S WONDERFUL.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.067
***

10:52.100 --> 10:55.267
(sighs) CAN I GIVE YOU
A CONGRATULATORY HUG?

10:55.300 --> 10:58.433
DON'T TOUCH MY ASS.

10:58.467 --> 11:01.333
MY STOMACH IS GROWLING.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.467
SORRY. WE CAN'T LET YOU EAT
BEFORE THE SURGERY.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.633
THAT'S OKAY. I STAYED
AT THE ARCHFIELD LAST NIGHT.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.133
I HAD THEM MAKE ME
BREAKFAST AT MIDNIGHT.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.067
YOU SHOULD TRY
THE FRENCH TOAST.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.067
IT'LL BLOW YOUR MIND.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.067
BREAKFAST AT THE ARCHFIELD
ON AN INTERN'S SALARY?

11:15.067 --> 11:16.767
YEAH, I KINDA LIVE THERE
AT THE MOMENT.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.500
MY WIFE HAS A DEAL THERE.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.467
THAT'S ONE HELL OF A DEAL.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.800
***

11:21.833 --> 11:24.333
SO OUR ROOM SERVICE BILL
AT THE ARCHFIELD,

11:24.367 --> 11:26.767
IS THAT PART OF THE DEAL?
YEAH, SURE.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.367
I MEAN, BREAKFAST ALONE IS,
WHAT, PROBABLY 50 BUCKS A DAY?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.300
AND THEY STILL ONLY CHARGE US
$400 A WEEK?

11:32.333 --> 11:33.833
SOMETIMES I PAY THEM MORE
FOR ROOM SERVICE.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.200
OKAY. WELL, THEN JUST TELL ME
HOW MUCH IT IS,

11:36.233 --> 11:38.167
AND WE'LL SPLIT IT
LIKE WE DO THE REST.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.533
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
GEORGE.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.433
NO, COME ON. I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE YOU PAY FOR ALL THE FOOD.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.367
JUST TELL ME HOW MUCH
THE ROOM SERVICE BILL IS.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.300
WE PAY ABOUT, MM,
800 A WEEK.
DOLLARS?

11:46.333 --> 11:48.233
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.600
YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.700
(lowers voice)
YES, I CAN.
HOW?

11:51.733 --> 11:54.533
I'M YOUR HUSBAND NOW. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO TELL ME THIS STUFF.

11:54.567 --> 11:56.333
OKAY. JUST COME HERE.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.200
ALL RIGHT, MY PARENTS
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY...
WHAT?

11:59.233 --> 12:01.133
AND SO I... HAVE MORE MONEY
THAN I'M MAKING.

12:01.167 --> 12:03.067
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A SPECIAL DEAL

12:03.100 --> 12:04.833
THROUGH FAMILY FRIENDS
AT THE ARCHFIELD.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.567
I JUST--I PAY FOR IT.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.367
HOW MUCH?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.833
(normal voice)
$2,500 A WEEK.

12:09.867 --> 12:12.300
YOU'RE AN HEIRESS.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.500
OKAY. SEE, THIS IS WHY
I DON'T TELL PEOPLE.
YOU'RE AN HEIRESS.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.600
NO, STOP TALKING.
YOU'RE AN HEIRESS?

12:15.633 --> 12:18.067
DON'T--JUST DON'T, OKAY?
STOP TALKING. STOP TALKING.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.433
I MEAN IT. I-I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE MY PARENTS' MONEY

12:20.467 --> 12:22.367
HAS AFFECTED EVERY SINGLE
RELATIONSHIP IN MY LIFE,

12:22.400 --> 12:24.633
AND SO I'VE STOPPED TALKING
ABOUT IT AND LIVING IT--

12:24.667 --> 12:26.567
NO, WAIT, WAIT.
SO WAIT. SO I'VE BEEN--

12:26.600 --> 12:29.067
I'VE BEEN PAYING YOU
$200 A WEEK FOR WHAT, FUN?

12:29.067 --> 12:31.833
(chuckles) NO. I USE IT
TO TIP HOUSEKEEPING.

12:31.867 --> 12:34.633
***

12:34.667 --> 12:36.300
GREAT!

12:36.333 --> 12:39.200
OH! OH, I'M--YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD I COULD PITCH IN.

12:39.233 --> 12:42.333
YOU KNOW, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

12:42.367 --> 12:44.200
THAT'S, I DON'T KNOW,
HUGE LIKE THIS?

12:44.233 --> 12:46.800
UH, I-I-I USED TO HAVE
A PET FERRET FOR NINE YEARS.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.567
GEORGE...

12:48.600 --> 12:50.067
***

12:50.100 --> 12:51.167
GREAT.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.700
STOP DISTRACTING
THE STAFF.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.633
YOU'RE PUSHY.
ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.267
(laughs)

12:58.300 --> 13:01.400
UM, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF A SAGITTAL SINUS BYPASS?

13:01.433 --> 13:04.300
HAVE YOU EVER SCRUBBED IN
ON A SAGITTAL SINUS BYPASS,

13:04.333 --> 13:05.667
DR. O'MALLEY?

13:05.700 --> 13:07.067
NO.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.533
IT IS WHAT THEY CALL
"BIG BALLS" SURGERY.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.067
APPARENTLY I HAVE
A SURGEON WITH--

13:11.067 --> 13:13.100
IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.
WHEN THE PATIENT
DOESN'T STROKE OUT.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.067
IF IT WORKS,
THE TUMOR'S ALL GONE.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.667
WE NEVER HAVE TO GO
BACK IN THERE AGAIN.
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, I'M DEAD.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.600
IF YOU REFUSE TO COME BACK IN
TWO YEARS, YOU'RE DEAD ANYWAY.
THAT'S A DECISION
I CAN LIVE WITH.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.833
THAT ISN'T A DECISION
I CAN LIVE WITH.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.800
O'MALLEY, GO FIND HER LABS.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.767
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

13:31.800 --> 13:35.067
A FEW YEARS ON A BEACH,
AND THEN WHAT?

13:35.067 --> 13:37.500
AFTER YOU PISS AWAY
YOUR SAVINGS,

13:37.533 --> 13:40.267
YOUR MEMORY GOES,
MOTOR SKILLS DETERIORATE,

13:40.300 --> 13:43.467
AND YOU'RE DYING A VERY SLOW,
MISERABLE, PAINFUL DEATH...

13:43.500 --> 13:44.467
DEREK--

13:44.500 --> 13:47.433
YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME UP
AND YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME

13:47.467 --> 13:50.333
WHY WE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING
WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.800
NOW THAT IS NOT SOMETHING
I CAN LIVE WITH,

13:52.833 --> 13:56.067
NOT WHEN WE CAN DO SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT IT.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.733
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE BULLET
HAS DAMAGED YOUR SCAPULA.

14:00.767 --> 14:03.733
NO WONDER IT HURTS.
HOW DID YOU GET SHOT, SIR?

14:03.767 --> 14:06.400
KOREA. GARDEN SPOT.
MAKES A NICE VACATION.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.333
CAN I GET
A DAMN PAINKILLER?

14:08.367 --> 14:10.267
I THINK
WE'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.300
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT OUT.
MY BULLET?

14:12.333 --> 14:14.233
(Richard) THERE WAS
NO REASON TO REMOVE IT

14:14.267 --> 14:16.200
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HIT,
BUT NOW IT'S INFECTED.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.133
IT'S WORKING ITS WAY

14:18.167 --> 14:20.467
INTO YOUR SCAPULA,
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
I NEED TO SEE THAT BULLET.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.633
YOU GONNA FRAME IT?
NO, SMARTY-PANTS.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.200
I WAS FRAGGED A COUPLE OF WEEKS
BEFORE IT ALL ENDED.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.267
"FRAGGED"?
(Richard) YEAH, SHOT BY
ONE OF HIS OWN MEN.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.500
I MADE A DECISION,
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

14:29.533 --> 14:32.400
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
WE'RE FACING ENEMY FIRE,

14:32.433 --> 14:35.200
AND I TAKE A HIT FROM
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LINE.

14:35.233 --> 14:37.233
I COULD NEVER PROVE IT,
BUT WE CAN PROVE IT NOW

14:37.267 --> 14:39.167
WHEN YOU PULL
THE DAMN THING OUT OF ME.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.700
GET ME MY BULLET.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.567
LET'S CALM DOWN, MR. SCOFIELD.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.567
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
WHEN YOUR OWN MEN TURN ON YOU?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.700
IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.433
I JUST AGREED TO HAVE DINNER
AT MY FATHER'S HOUSE, TONIGHT.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.333
OH.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.367
AND CRISTINA SLEPT WITH
COLIN MARLOWE.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.067
"MARLOWE TRANSPLANT" MARLOWE?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.833
THEY HAD A THING
WHEN SHE WAS A STUDENT.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.700
HOW COULD I HAVE A MEAL
AT MY FATHER'S HOUSE?
HE SLEPT WITH CRISTINA?

15:05.733 --> 15:07.633
DEREK.
OH, RIGHT. SORRY. OKAY.

15:07.667 --> 15:09.567
UM, HAVE DINNER AT YOUR HOUSE.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.233
IT'S YOUR PLACE.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.133
I'LL COME.
I'LL BE YOUR WINGMAN.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.433
IT'LL BE FUN.
OKAY, IT WON'T BE FUN.

15:15.467 --> 15:17.367
BUT IT'LL BE...
IT'LL BE FINE.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.700
THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.700
WHY DOES EVERYONE ASSUME THAT?
YOU DESERVE TO HAVE
A FAMILY,

15:21.733 --> 15:23.267
WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.200
***

15:25.233 --> 15:27.133
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.100
WE AGREED I WOULDN'T SLEEP
WITH ANYBODY FOR TWO MONTHS.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.800
WE NEVER SAID I WOULDN'T LOOK.
YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D HOLD OUT.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.733
NO, I DIDN'T.
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.633
YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.567
SHE'S RICH, TOTALLY RICH,
BOATLOADS OF MONEY.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.267
GEORGE, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.300
NO, IT'S...
IT'S NOT FANTASTIC.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.367
(sighs)

15:43.400 --> 15:45.267
CRISTINA DID COLIN MARLOWE.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.700
CALLIE'S RICH.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.633
DON'T TALK TO HER
ABOUT IT.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.533
"HER"? I'M SORRY, I DON'T
HAVE A NAME ANYMORE.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.467
"DON'T TELL ANYONE."
THOSE WERE MY WORDS.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.800
SO--SO SHE'S RICH.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.700
JUST SHUT UP ABOUT IT.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

15:56.733 --> 16:00.267
***

16:00.300 --> 16:01.633
IF YOU GIVE ME

16:01.667 --> 16:03.533
THE "PEOPLE IS WHAT MATTERS"
THING AGAIN,

16:03.567 --> 16:05.433
I WILL KILL YOU.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.167
WAS IT GOOD?
WAS HE GOOD?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.133
DID HE MAKE YOU
A BETTER LOVER?
REMEMBER ALL THE OTHER TIMES

16:11.167 --> 16:13.233
I'VE TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT MY SEX LIFE?
NO.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.433
EXACTLY.
DID I MISS ANYTHING
ABOUT HER DOING THE OLD GUY?

16:15.467 --> 16:17.367
SHE'S NOT TALKING.
OH, SHE'LL TALK.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.267
SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BACK
IN THE GAME TODAY,

16:19.300 --> 16:21.533
BUT INSTEAD I'M PLANNING DINNER
FOR MY FATHER

16:21.567 --> 16:23.567
IN MY DEAD MOTHER'S HOUSE.
I DON'T COOK.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.333
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
COOK FOR THEM?
I WILL MAKE
YOUR STUPID DINNER.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.367
SO WERE THERE ANY LITTLE
BLUE PILLS INVOLVED,

16:28.400 --> 16:30.633
OR IS HE UNTOUCHED BY TIME?
DUDE, THAT'S JUST WRONG.
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.800
BECAUSE I AM YOUR FRIEND,
I WILL SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE

16:32.833 --> 16:35.067
45 MINUTES INTO THE DINNER
WITH A FAKE CRISIS.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.533
SO IF IT'S, UH, UNBEARABLE,
YOU CAN ABORT.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.800
OH, THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.633
COME ON. HE'S NOT A YOUNG MAN.
HE WASN'T GETTING A LITTLE HELP?

16:42.667 --> 16:44.700
POPPIN' THE PILL?
DAD'S BEST FRIEND?

16:44.733 --> 16:46.500
COME ON.
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME NOTHING

16:46.533 --> 16:48.233
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?

16:48.267 --> 16:49.400
NOTHING?

16:51.767 --> 16:53.200
IT'S A MIRACLE DRUG.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.233
AND SOMEDAY,
IT'LL SAVE YOUR LIFE.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.167
AH, DR. MARLOWE?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.533
DEREK SHEPHERD. NEURO.
AH.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.467
I'M DOING A SAGITTAL SINUS
BYPASS TODAY

17:01.500 --> 17:02.767
IF YOU'D LIKE TO OBSERVE.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.467
REALLY?
THAT'S QUITE A PROCEDURE.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.433
WELL, IT'S A GOOD TRICK,
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED

17:06.467 --> 17:08.367
TO SEE
WHAT THIS HOSPITAL CAN DO,

17:08.400 --> 17:10.300
I'M PERFORMING
AN ARTERIAL SWITCH OPERATION

17:10.333 --> 17:11.533
FOR A T.G.A. THIS AFTERNOON.

17:11.567 --> 17:14.133
IF YOU GENTLEMEN ARE TRYING
TO INTIMIDATE THE COMPETITION,

17:14.167 --> 17:15.333
IT'S WORKING.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.767
GOOD.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.800
I'LL SEE BOTH OF YOU
IN SURGERY.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.733
COLIN MARLOWE.
THE ONE AND ONLY.

17:21.767 --> 17:23.133
HE...
YES.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.067
WITH...
YES.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.433
WOW.
INDEED.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.200
YEAH.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.700
SUCTION.

17:29.733 --> 17:32.367
NO, NOT LIKE
YOU'RE DRIVING A TRACTOR.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.467
SLOWLY. BETTER.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.800
WHAT'S THE CHANCE SHE WAKES UP
AND REMEMBERS EVERYTHING?

17:36.833 --> 17:38.400
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.267
DR. SLOAN,
THE BABY'S HAVING DECELS.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.167
ARE YOU SURE? SOMETIMES
THE MONITOR'S NOT ON RIGHT.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.067
YOU GET A FALSE READ.
SHE'S GOT VAGINAL BLEEDING.
THE BABY'S IN DISTRESS.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.500
OH, DAMN IT.
PAGE DR. MONTGOMERY. NOW!

17:47.533 --> 17:49.433
(Colin) YOU'RE MAKING
AN HONEST WOMAN

17:49.467 --> 17:50.800
OF CRISTINA YANG.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.333
THAT'S--THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

17:52.367 --> 17:54.267
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS
COLLECTING US,

17:54.300 --> 17:55.633
LIKE BASEBALL CARDS.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.167
BASEBALL CARDS?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.100
WELL, SHE LIKES
AN AUTHORITY FIGURE,

17:59.133 --> 18:01.067
SOMEONE WITH SOMETHING
TO TEACH HER.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.633
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
SHE WOULD ACTUALLY COMMIT.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.267
SHE USE TO SAY TO ME
THAT SHE THOUGHT

18:05.300 --> 18:08.067
THAT MARRIAGE WAS FOR
THE WEAK AND UNDIRECTED.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.800
I MADE A NUMBER
OF MARRIAGE PROPOSALS.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.733
IT SEEMED
THE POLITE THING TO DO

18:11.767 --> 18:13.533
AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME
TOGETHER,

18:13.567 --> 18:15.267
BUT, UH,
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE IT.

18:15.300 --> 18:18.533
ALL WHAT TIME? YOU WERE JUST
HAVING A FLING WITH A STUDENT.

18:18.567 --> 18:21.533
A FLING? CRISTINA AND I
WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.700
IS THE PROBLEM THAT
I SLEPT WITH MY PROFESSOR,

18:30.733 --> 18:32.633
OR THAT I WAS COMMITTED ENOUGH
TO KEEP AT IT FOR THREE YEARS?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.300
OH, NO. YOU TOLD HIM

18:34.333 --> 18:36.233
THAT YOU THOUGHT MARRIAGE
WAS AN IDIOTIC INSTITUTION.
IT IS.

18:36.267 --> 18:38.433
THEN WHY DID YOU SAY YES?
BECAUSE I WANT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.067
"HAPPY"?
YOU KNOW, I'LL DO A LOT
OF THINGS TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.600
DO I GIVE A CRAP

18:42.633 --> 18:45.500
ABOUT A CEREMONY WITH A DRESS
AND A FLAUTIST? NO.

18:45.533 --> 18:48.400
BUT I'M HAPPY TO DO IT
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.700
HEARTWARMING. THANKS.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.500
(sighs)

18:54.533 --> 18:56.400
YOU COULDN'T HAVE WAITED
ONE DAY?

18:56.433 --> 18:59.467
SHE WAS 40% VISION COMPROMISED
IN HER RIGHT EYE.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.700
IT WOULD'VE BEEN
GONE TOMORROW.
NO, IT WOULDN'T, ACTUALLY,
BUT THERE'S

19:01.733 --> 19:04.333
A SNAZZY NEW CHIEF CANDIDATE
MARCHING AROUND THE HALL TODAY,

19:04.367 --> 19:06.133
AND YOU NEEDED TO BE A HERO.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.833
THAT'S WHAT NEEDED
TO HAPPEN TODAY.
THE PATIENT WAS FINE, ADDISON.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.467
THE BABY'S STILL IN HER UTERUS,
AND SHE'S NOT LOSING AN EYE.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.700
EVERY SURGERY IS RISKY.
THE PATIENT CHOSE THIS ONE.

19:13.733 --> 19:16.367
KAREV...
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.333
THE PATIENT'S BABY WAS
IN DISTRESS. GO. STAY WITH HER.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.100
SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH JANE DOE?

19:21.133 --> 19:23.100
YEAH, SHE CAN SEE, AND ADDISON'S
GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT.

19:23.133 --> 19:25.467
HE RUSHED HER INTO SURGERY,
AND SHE ALMOST LOST THE BABY.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.400
I HAD TO SEW
HER CERVIX SHUT.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.767
THE COMPLICATIONS HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SURGERY.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.600
AND WHY? WHY DO YOU THINK
MARK MOVED SO QUICKLY, DEREK?

19:32.633 --> 19:35.133
DO YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE
A PIECE OF THE ORBITAL BONE

19:35.167 --> 19:36.200
WAS FLOATING TOWARDS
THE BRAIN?

19:36.233 --> 19:38.433
WELL, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
MARK WANTS A PROMOTION.

19:38.467 --> 19:41.133
YOU'RE NOT HER HUSBAND.
THIS ISN'T YOUR PATIENT.

19:41.167 --> 19:43.567
STAY OUT OF IT!
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU PEOPLE
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.067
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS HOSPITAL.

19:46.067 --> 19:48.833
SCREAMING ABOUT A PATIENT
IN THE HALLWAY?

19:48.867 --> 19:51.267
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

19:54.167 --> 19:56.533
(Colin) TOUGH PROCEDURE.
MM-HMM.

19:56.567 --> 19:58.400
IT'S A BOLD CHOICE.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.333
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
THIS ONE FOR A WHILE.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.667
I'M HOPING THIS WILL BE
THE END OF IT.
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:02.700 --> 20:05.467
WHAT HAPPENED?
(man) END-TIDAL C0-2
JUST DROPPED FROM 30 TO 16.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.033
BAGGING MANUALLY.
DOPPLER'S SHOWING AIR
IN THE LEFT VENTRICLE.

20:08.067 --> 20:09.767
(George) 0-2 STAT'S
DOWN TO 89.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.833
(Derek) ASPIRATE
THE CENTRAL LINE.
SHE'S BRADYCARDIC.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.667
PUSH 1 OF ATROPINE.
THERE'S NO AIR
IN THE CENTRAL LINE.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.233
ALL RIGHT, LEVEL HER OUT.
I'M GONNA FLOOD THE FIELD.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.467
(Colin) ASYSTOLE.
PUSH 1 MILLIGRAM OF EPI.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.633
START COMPRESSIONS. GO. GET IN
THERE. GET IN THERE! DO IT!

20:21.667 --> 20:23.567
THAT THINGS BEEN IN THERE
SINCE THE KOREAN WAR?

20:23.600 --> 20:27.233
HE'S LUCKY IT DIDN'T
TRAVEL DOWN TO HIS AORTA.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.167
OKAY, A LITTLE SUCTION THERE.
ALMOST...

20:30.200 --> 20:33.433
I GOT IT. (sighs)

20:33.467 --> 20:35.833
MAKE SURE WE GET THAT BACK.
THE PATIENT WANTS IT.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.733
HE'S GOT A WARPED SENSE
OF NOSTALGIA.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.200
HMM, I GET IT. IF THEY
PULLED A BULLET OUT OF ME,

20:40.233 --> 20:43.100
I'D WANT IT CAST IN GOLD
AND MOUNTED ON MY WALL.

20:43.133 --> 20:45.667
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN AFFORD IT.
(Richard)
JUST A LITTLE MORE SUCTION.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.367
LET'S GET READY TO CLOSE.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.533
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:51.567 --> 20:54.433
(Derek) SHE'S NOT RESPONDING.
I'M GONNA OPEN HER UP.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.333
OPEN CARDIAC MASSAGE?
YOU'RE A NEUROSURGEON.

20:56.367 --> 20:58.667
YOU HAVE NO PRIVILEGES
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.533
GET THE GLASSES OFF.
SHOULD WE PAGE DR. BURKE?

21:01.567 --> 21:04.100
NO, I'VE GOT IT.
CROSS CLAMP THE HILUM.

21:04.133 --> 21:06.767
YOU DON'T WANT AIR
IN THE CEREBRAL ARTERIES.
YEAH, I GOT IT.
GIVE ME A 10-BLADE.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.833
10-BLADE QUICKLY, PLEASE.
O'MALLEY, GET OVER HERE.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.467
LET'S ROLL HER. READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE. GO.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.167
OKAY, RIB SPREADER.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.100
(beeping continues)

21:20.833 --> 21:23.133
OKAY, SCISSORS.

21:27.767 --> 21:30.533
MASSAGE HER HEART, O'MALLEY.

21:30.567 --> 21:34.600
(beeping continues)

21:34.633 --> 21:36.367
I NEED TO ASPIRATE.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.433
(beeping continues)

21:38.467 --> 21:40.367
(Colin) ANY AIR RETURN?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.067
10 cc's.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.367
(beeping continues)

21:46.400 --> 21:48.567
(man) END-TIDAL C0-2
IS GOING BACK UP.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.667
(George) THE HEART'S STARTING
TO BEAT ON ITS OWN.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.400
PRESSURE'S 60 OVER 40.
IT'S LOW, BUT IT'S THERE.

21:53.433 --> 21:55.400
SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

21:55.433 --> 21:56.467
YEAH.

21:58.467 --> 22:01.400
(sighs)

22:01.433 --> 22:04.833
SHOULD I START
CLOSING HER UP?

22:04.867 --> 22:07.067
DR. SHEPHERD?

22:07.067 --> 22:09.367
O'MALLEY, I JUST SLICED
MY FRIEND'S CHEST OPEN.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.733
GIVE ME A MOMENT.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.567
(sighs)

22:13.600 --> 22:15.500
THAT WAS VERY WELL-HANDLED,
DR. SHEPHERD.

22:15.533 --> 22:16.633
VERY IMPRESSIVE, INDEED.

22:16.667 --> 22:19.433
NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO DO
EVERY DAY, BUT THANK YOU.

22:19.467 --> 22:20.633
WHAT HAPPENED?

22:20.667 --> 22:22.567
DR. SHEPHERD'S PATIENT HAD
A VENOUS AIR EMBOLISM.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.200
HE HAD TO SPLIT HER CHEST OPEN,
MASSAGE HER HEART

22:25.233 --> 22:27.133
AND MANUALLY ASPIRATE

22:27.167 --> 22:29.067
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS PROCEDURE.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.167
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.733
UH, YOU WERE OPERATING.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.633
I WAS NEXT DOOR.
YOU COULD'VE PULLED ME OUT.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.700
THERE WAS NO TIME.
I HANDLED IT.

22:36.733 --> 22:39.533
YOU THINK I CRACK PEOPLE'S HEADS
OPEN IF YOU'RE IN THE BUILDING

22:39.567 --> 22:41.600
JUST BECAUSE I THINK
I CAN HANDLE A BRAIN BLEED?
THE PATIENT IS FINE.

22:41.633 --> 22:45.233
THE PATIENT IS LUCKY,
AND YOU WERE SHOWBOATING.
SHOWBOATING? WHAT, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND? I WAS--

22:45.267 --> 22:48.200
WE SEEM TO BE GOING OUT OF
OUR WAY TO IMPRESS DR. MARLOWE.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.567
I'LL BET WE ARE.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.100
GENTLEMEN...

22:53.233 --> 22:55.733
GOOD DAY, DOCTORS.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.533
HOW YOU FEELING,
MR. SCOFIELD?

23:07.567 --> 23:10.067
WHERE'S MY BULLET?

23:12.867 --> 23:15.700
(Scofield sighs)

23:17.200 --> 23:18.767
THAT IT?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.567
WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.633
THAT WAS IT.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.200
IS THAT A LETTER?
CAN YOU READ THAT?

23:25.233 --> 23:27.133
I-I DON'T THINK
IT'S MUCH OF ANYTHING.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.067
I-I THINK
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.267
IT'S SO SMALL.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.333
IT COULD JUST BE ANYTHING.

23:32.367 --> 23:36.067
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
THEY DON'T HOLD UP THAT WELL.

23:36.067 --> 23:38.833
COULD YOU HAVE YOUR LAB,
YOU KNOW, ANALYZE IT?

23:38.867 --> 23:40.767
TELL ME IF IT'S
ONE OF OURS OR--

23:40.800 --> 23:44.567
WE'RE NOT SET UP FOR THAT KIND
OF INVESTIGATION, MR. SCOFIELD.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.167
YOU COULD TRY TO SEND IT
TO A FORENSIC LAB,

23:47.200 --> 23:50.433
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL
TELL YOU MUCH EITHER.

23:53.467 --> 23:58.333
I'VE BEEN STEWING
FOR 50 YEARS.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.233
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

24:00.267 --> 24:01.833
TO WHAT?

24:01.867 --> 24:05.300
I LOST MY WHOLE UNIT
OVER THIS.

24:05.333 --> 24:06.800
I CAME HOME.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.733
MY WIFE, SHE DIDN'T GET IT.

24:08.767 --> 24:13.267
I'VE BEEN BLAZING MAD
MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:13.300 --> 24:18.233
I GOT NOTHING LEFT.

24:18.267 --> 24:21.133
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO LET IT GO

24:21.167 --> 24:23.500
AND START OVER.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.633
YOU'RE A SWEET KID,

24:27.667 --> 24:29.567
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

24:29.600 --> 24:34.433
TO HAVE SOMETHING CHANGE YOU
IN YOUR SOUL.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.300
I DO.

24:37.333 --> 24:40.067
I WISH I DIDN'T,
BUT I DO.

24:40.067 --> 24:43.367
DON'T LET IT TURN YOU.

24:45.533 --> 24:47.833
(Miranda) YOU LOOK LIKE

24:47.867 --> 24:49.700
YOU HAD A LONG DAY.

24:49.733 --> 24:51.533
YOU KNOW WHAT FRAGGING IS?

24:51.567 --> 24:52.733
MM-HMM.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.667
WE'VE GOT AN EPIDEMIC
OF IT TODAY.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.600
MY ESTEEMED ATTENDINGS
ARE GONNA BE THE DEATH OF ME.

24:56.633 --> 24:59.300
IS THERE A FRONT-RUNNER?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.500
I DON'T KNOW.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.067
WHAT I DO KNOW IS
I DON'T WANT MY ATTENDINGS

25:03.100 --> 25:04.733
TEARING EACH OTHER'S
THROATS OUT

25:04.767 --> 25:06.667
BECAUSE OF SOME
INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.133
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.667
DOES THAT MEAN...

25:10.700 --> 25:13.467
IS COLIN MARLOWE GONNA BE
THE NEW CHIEF?

25:13.500 --> 25:15.633
GOOD NIGHT, DR. BAILEY.

25:22.567 --> 25:25.367
THIS IS READY.
DON'T SLOSH IT AROUND.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.067
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE PRESENTATION.

25:28.067 --> 25:30.800
COME IN AND EAT WITH US.
YOU NEED TO BOND
WITH YOUR PEOPLE, MEREDITH.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.067
PEOPLE ARE WHAT MATTERS.
I HATE PEOPLE.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.733
YEAH, WELL,
DO YOUR OWN TALKING.
WE TALKED.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.633
WE TALKED HOSPITAL,
WE TALKED HIS RESEARCH,

25:37.667 --> 25:40.367
WE TALKED DEAD MOTHER.
I'M OUT.
ASK ABOUT THE BABY.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.400
ASK IF IT POOS. PEOPLE CAN
GO ON ABOUT THAT FOR HOURS.

25:44.433 --> 25:47.200
(Susan) OH,
THE CHICKEN LOOKS DELICIOUS.

25:47.233 --> 25:49.300
YEAH.
IT'S FROM THE STORE.

25:49.333 --> 25:52.133
WELL, THE GREEN BEANS
LOOK GREAT AS WELL.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.767
I... DIDN'T DO THOSE EITHER.

25:57.733 --> 26:00.567
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.467
IZZIE DID THAT.
OH.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.400
ALEX!

26:04.433 --> 26:06.333
COME, SIT.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.300
(Derek) OH.
(Thatcher) NO, GO AHEAD.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.733
EAT. WE'RE EATING.

26:10.767 --> 26:13.800
THIS IS SUSAN,
AND THIS IS MY FATHER.
HI.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.067
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE
THIS PLATE.

26:16.067 --> 26:17.167
COOL.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.767
OKAY. SO HOW ARE YOU?
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

26:19.800 --> 26:21.833
OKAY. HUNGRY.

26:21.867 --> 26:22.800
GOOD.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.267
MMM.

26:25.733 --> 26:29.400
HOW'S THE BABY?
GREAT.

26:29.433 --> 26:32.333
SHE'S SMILING NOW...
SOMETIMES. (laughs)
(laughs)

26:32.367 --> 26:35.100
SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MOLLY
WH-WHEN SHE SMILES.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.067
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.

26:37.067 --> 26:39.100
I'VE GOT THIS OLD PICTURE
OF MOLLY AND ME

26:39.133 --> 26:41.467
WHEN MOLLY WAS...
I DON'T KNOW, 5,

26:41.500 --> 26:44.167
AND SHE'S SITTING ON THIS
RED SLED IN THE SNOW,

26:44.200 --> 26:45.600
THIS GREAT, BIG FIR TREE...

26:45.633 --> 26:47.533
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT--

26:47.567 --> 26:50.233
YEAH. NO, HONEY,
IT'S A MASSIVE DOUGLAS FIR.

26:50.267 --> 26:52.133
AND IN THE PICTURE, COULDN'T
LOOK MORE LIKE THE BABY.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.600
I MEAN, INCREDIBLE.

26:53.633 --> 26:55.367
THAT'S ME.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.367
THE RED SLED
AND THE BIG FIR TREE

27:00.400 --> 27:02.300
IN THE PARK
AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

27:02.333 --> 27:06.767
IN THE UGLY, YELLOW,
PLAID WOOL COAT.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.633
THAT ISN'T MOLLY.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.667
IT'S YOU AND ME.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.400
***

27:18.567 --> 27:20.467
OH, GREAT.
(Izzie) CRAP.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.767
SORRY. I THINK I BLEW
A FUSE.
SORRY.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.067
I'LL GET IT.
NO, YOU KNOW,
I COULD GET IT. IT'S--

27:26.067 --> 27:27.800
OH, IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.100
I KEEP FORGETTING.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.633
WHAT?

27:31.667 --> 27:33.400
IT'S HIS HOUSE.

27:33.433 --> 27:37.533
***

27:37.567 --> 27:39.467
I'M GOING HOME.

27:41.333 --> 27:44.733
***

27:44.767 --> 27:46.800
ARE YOU GOING HOME?

27:46.833 --> 27:50.533
HOW DID IT END?

27:50.567 --> 27:51.733
IT ENDED.

27:51.767 --> 27:53.667
SCHOOL WAS ENDING,
I WAS LEAVING.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.633
YOU WERE DONE.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.333
I CAME HERE.

27:57.367 --> 27:59.267
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

27:59.300 --> 28:02.067
A NEW MENTOR WITH A HOST OF
NEW THINGS TO TEACH YOU.

28:02.067 --> 28:03.600
IF YOU THINK THAT I'M IN THIS
FOR THE EDUCATION--

28:03.633 --> 28:05.533
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT
FIND MY KNOWLEDGE

28:05.567 --> 28:07.233
AND MY SKILL COMPELLING?

28:07.267 --> 28:09.600
OH, GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE
BLOWING THIS WAY OUT OF--

28:09.633 --> 28:11.533
A MAN THREE TIMES YOUR AGE

28:11.567 --> 28:12.733
BELIEVED THAT HE WAS HAVING

28:12.767 --> 28:14.433
A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU...

28:14.467 --> 28:15.633
WELL, YEAH, HE WAS.

28:15.667 --> 28:17.567
AND ONE DAY, YOU'RE DONE,
JUST LIKE THAT?

28:17.600 --> 28:19.500
(scoffs) YES.

28:19.533 --> 28:22.367
YOU DON'T OPEN YOURSELF UP...

28:22.400 --> 28:24.133
TO ANYONE.

28:24.167 --> 28:26.067
SOMETIMES...
I THINK IT'S CHARMING--

28:26.100 --> 28:28.700
SHE'S DIFFERENT,
SHE'S NOT LIKE OTHER WOMEN.

28:28.733 --> 28:30.200
BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS--

28:30.233 --> 28:32.133
IS THAT YOU HAVE
NEVER LET ME IN.

28:32.167 --> 28:35.067
WHAT, YOU THINK THAT IT'S
GONNA MAKE A GOOD MARRIAGE?

28:35.067 --> 28:36.567
WELL, I DON'T.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.667
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MARRY ME
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLACATING ME.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.833
THAT DOESN'T INTEREST ME.

28:41.867 --> 28:44.533
IT DOESN'T INTEREST ME
AT ALL.

28:44.567 --> 28:47.467
***

28:49.100 --> 28:50.267
DO YOU THINK HE'S OKAY?

28:50.300 --> 28:52.100
HE'LL FIND IT.

28:52.133 --> 28:53.433
HE PROBABLY CAN'T SEE.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.267
UM, THERE'S A FLASHLIGHT
IN THE CLOSET.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.633
I'LL GO GET IT.
THANKS.

28:57.667 --> 28:58.833
EXCUSE ME.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.633
(sighs)

29:00.667 --> 29:02.333
I'M SORRY.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.533
IT'S GOING FINE.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.467
I JUST...

29:05.500 --> 29:07.733
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

29:07.767 --> 29:09.400
WELL, IT'S NOT EASY.

29:09.433 --> 29:12.300
THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE'S AFRAID OF YOU.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.233
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BIT
HIS HEAD OFF.

29:14.267 --> 29:16.267
I WISH I COULD'VE JUST...

29:16.300 --> 29:20.200
MEREDITH, IT'S OKAY
TO GET ANGRY.

29:20.233 --> 29:22.633
IT'S YOU IN THE PICTURE.

29:24.533 --> 29:26.600
IZZIE STEVENS?
I SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU

29:26.633 --> 29:29.300
THAT I CLEARLY FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT,

29:29.333 --> 29:32.067
AND YOU TELL IZZIE STEVENS?
NO, I DIDN'T TELL IZZIE.
I TOLD MEREDITH.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.167
MEREDITH TOLD--
OH! OH, SO THAT'S BETTER?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.333
NO, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I--
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.767
I WAS PISSED OFF--WHY CAN'T YOU
GIVE ME THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

29:39.800 --> 29:41.767
THAT--THAT MAYBE SOMETIMES
I'M ON YOUR SIDE?

29:41.800 --> 29:44.233
BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS
OVER ME EVERY CHANCE YOU GET.

29:44.267 --> 29:45.767
NO, I DON'T.
I MARRIED YOU,

29:45.800 --> 29:47.700
AND I HAVEN'T TALKED TO
MY BEST FRIEND IN WEEKS.

29:47.733 --> 29:49.533
MEANWHILE YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE AND WHY.

29:49.567 --> 29:51.200
YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.

29:51.233 --> 29:52.767
YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY!

29:52.800 --> 29:55.567
AND STILL I'M THE DOG
WHO GETS WHACKED ON THE NOSE

29:55.600 --> 29:57.500
WITH A NEWSPAPER ALL THE TIME.
WHEN IS THIS GONNA STOP?

29:57.533 --> 30:00.100
OH, SO THIS IS MY PROBLEM?
YEAH, MAYBE IT IS.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.033
OH, OH, SO THE FACT THAT
YOUR BEST FRIEND

30:02.067 --> 30:04.200
VIOLENTLY DISSES OUR MARRIAGE
EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS,

30:04.233 --> 30:05.733
PUBLICLY, REPEATEDLY...

30:05.767 --> 30:07.500
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE DOES THAT GEORGE?

30:07.533 --> 30:08.767
HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

30:08.800 --> 30:11.633
SHE'S HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.700
SHE HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU.
WHAT?

30:13.733 --> 30:16.300
SHE WANTS YOU.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.233
SHE WANTS YOU.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

30:18.267 --> 30:20.267
THAT'S WHY SHE HATES ME.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.467
(snickers)

30:21.500 --> 30:25.300
GEORGE, GEORGE,
DO NOT LAUGH AT ME.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.033
DO NOT LAUGH AT ME.

30:27.067 --> 30:28.800
NO. (chuckles) NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.800
OH, GOD.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.700
(chuckles) I'M NOT. I--

30:32.733 --> 30:34.767
IT'S JUST, COME ON,
SHE'S IZZIE.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.433
SHE'S--SHE'S BL--

30:36.467 --> 30:39.167
SHE'S BLONDE, SHE'S STACKED,
SHE'S--SHE'S A SUPERMODEL.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.367
I'M GEORGE.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.133
SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

30:46.167 --> 30:48.167
NO. NO, COME ON.
YOU ARE GORGEOUS...
(scoffs)

30:48.200 --> 30:50.533
AND YOU'RE CURVY, AND I NEVER
THOUGHT YOU'D GO FOR ME.

30:50.567 --> 30:51.800
JUST SHUT UP.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.533
CALLIE--
THIS IS MY HOTEL ROOM

30:53.567 --> 30:57.433
THAT I PAY FOR
WITH MY HUGE PILES OF MONEY.

30:57.467 --> 30:59.800
GET THE HELL OUT OF IT!

31:10.367 --> 31:11.067
(water running)

31:11.067 --> 31:12.700
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE LIGHTS.

31:12.733 --> 31:13.500
(water stops)

31:13.533 --> 31:15.067
EH, WHATEVER.
THE FOOD WAS GOOD.

31:15.067 --> 31:16.533
YOU WANT SOME PIE?

31:16.567 --> 31:17.767
NAH, I GOTTA GO.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.433
OH, BIG PLANS.
GOT A HOT DATE?

31:21.667 --> 31:23.467
OH.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.333
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

31:27.367 --> 31:30.367
I GUESS "NOT INTERESTED"
REALLY MEANT NOT INTERESTED.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.200
IZ...

31:32.233 --> 31:34.833
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME.

31:34.867 --> 31:37.067
YEAH.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.433
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

31:38.467 --> 31:40.367
I WANT YOU
TO WANT ANYONE ELSE.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.600
AM I GONNA BE ALONE,

31:43.633 --> 31:45.500
PINING OVER
A DEAD GUY FOREVER?

31:45.533 --> 31:47.467
I HOPE NOT.
IT'S KIND OF A WASTE.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.067
(sighs)

31:50.100 --> 31:51.833
AM I SUPPOSED TO
MOVE ON NOW?

31:51.867 --> 31:53.733
DO PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND GO,

31:53.767 --> 31:55.667
"SHE'S GOTTA
GET OVER IT ALREADY.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.133
IT'S RUINING HER LIFE"?

31:57.167 --> 31:59.567
YOU'LL MOVE ON
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.267
WHY ARE YOU SITTING
IN THE DARK?

32:10.300 --> 32:11.467
IZZIE BLEW A FUSE.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.167
OKAY, I'M HAVING A CRISIS.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.300
OH, I DON'T NEED RESCUING.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.600
SUSAN IS VERY NICE,
AND WE'RE GETTING THROUGH IT.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.533
LIMPING THROUGH,
BUT WE'LL MAKE IT.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.467
OKAY, NO, THIS ISN'T
A FAKE CRISIS.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.733
THIS IS A REAL,

32:24.767 --> 32:27.833
"MY EX IS ABOUT TO RUIN
MY IMPENDING MARRIAGE" CRISIS.
OH.

32:27.867 --> 32:30.400
HEY. HEY. WHERE'S IZZIE?

32:30.433 --> 32:31.667
KITCHEN.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.567
SORRY.
IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.200
YEAH, IT--IT KINDA IS.

32:39.067 --> 32:40.233
THEY'RE IN THE OTHER ROOM.

32:40.267 --> 32:42.167
I NEED YOU
TO GET OVER YOURSELF.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.100
I NEED YOU TO START LIKING
MY WIFE.

32:44.133 --> 32:46.767
I NEED YOU TO LIKE HER
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I DON'T,

32:46.800 --> 32:48.833
AND I NEED YOU TO TALK ME
BACK INTO IT.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.433
YOU SAY YOU'RE MY FRIEND?
THAT'S THE JOB.
OKAY.

32:51.467 --> 32:54.333
I NEED TO VENT,
AND I NEED IT TO BE OKAY.
OKAY.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.267
AND I NEED TO VENT
WITH ALCOHOL.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.267
I GOT MARRIED, AND I'M SCARED
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.267
(sighs)
NOBODY EVER GOT MARRIED

33:05.300 --> 33:07.533
AND DIDN'T THINK THAT
AT LEAST ONCE.

33:12.733 --> 33:14.800
(door creaks)

33:14.833 --> 33:17.533
DID YOU FIND THE FUSE BOX?

33:17.567 --> 33:20.500
YEAH. YEAH,
I JUST NEEDED TO...

33:20.533 --> 33:22.367
TAKE A BREAK?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.700
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO--

33:24.733 --> 33:27.600
OR WHAT TO TALK TO HER ABOUT.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.533
WORK'S A GOOD PLACE
TO START.

33:29.567 --> 33:31.467
YOU KNOW, SHE'S PROUD
OF WHAT SHE DOES.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.733
SHE'S GOOD AT IT, TOO.

33:33.767 --> 33:35.100
I'D START WITH THAT.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.600
YOU GET EACH OTHER.
THAT'S NICE.

33:37.633 --> 33:40.533
SOME DAYS IT'S NICE.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.433
SOME DAYS I'D LIKE TO
COME HOME TO SOMEONE

33:43.467 --> 33:45.600
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
A THING ABOUT IT.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.267
ROUGH DAY?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.367
(sighs)

33:49.400 --> 33:53.167
I ALMOST LOST A FRIEND
IN MY OWN O.R.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.167
WAS IT YOUR FAULT?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.667
I DON'T KNOW.

33:59.367 --> 34:00.733
(sighs)

34:00.767 --> 34:03.200
YOU WERE BOTH NERVOUS
TONIGHT.

34:03.233 --> 34:04.600
IT'LL GET EASIER.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.167
YEAH.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.533
SHE'S TOUGH.

34:09.567 --> 34:12.300
SHE TRIES TO HIDE IT.
SHE'S DIFFICULT.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.167
BUT IF YOU MAKE AN EFFORT,

34:14.200 --> 34:16.500
SHE'S WORTH IT.

34:16.533 --> 34:18.667
YOU OKAY?

34:18.700 --> 34:22.067
NOT ENTIRELY.

34:23.633 --> 34:26.167
SHE'S WORTH THE EFFORT.

34:29.433 --> 34:33.133
ALL RIGHT.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.267
AH, NICE.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.633
(pager beeps)

34:37.667 --> 34:38.600
(sighs)

34:38.633 --> 34:40.133
DAMN IT.

34:40.167 --> 34:41.500
GOTTA GO BACK IN, HUH?

34:41.533 --> 34:42.467
YEAH.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.700
(chuckles)

34:48.300 --> 34:50.700
WHY IS THERE
AN 11-INCH INCISION

34:50.733 --> 34:52.400
IN MY CHEST?

34:52.433 --> 34:54.333
(sighs) YOU CODED
ON THE TABLE--

34:54.367 --> 34:55.533
AIR EMBOLUS.

34:55.567 --> 34:57.833
I HAD TO OPEN YOU UP
AND ASPIRATE.

34:57.867 --> 34:59.767
SEE, I'M SURE YOU DID
A GREAT JOB,

34:59.800 --> 35:02.667
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE SOME REAL TROUBLE

35:02.700 --> 35:04.767
CONVINCING ME TO DO IT AGAIN.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.467
HELEN...

35:06.500 --> 35:08.567
WE GOT IT ALL.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.567
THE TUMOR--WE NEVER HAVE TO
GO BACK IN THERE AGAIN.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.333
YOU'RE SURE?
I'M SURE.

35:15.367 --> 35:19.333
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE A LONG,
LONG LIFE.

35:19.367 --> 35:23.133
AND HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE JUST BEING AN ASS.

35:23.167 --> 35:24.800
AH, I WAS AN ASS.

35:28.833 --> 35:31.800
I HAD NO RIGHT
TO PUSH YOU LIKE THAT.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.633
NO, YOU DID NOT.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.567
I WAS GOING THROUGH
SOME STUFF,

35:35.600 --> 35:37.267
AND I JUST--I...

35:37.300 --> 35:39.067
I WAS AN ASS.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.533
OKAY.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.100
BUT IN THIS MOMENT,

35:42.133 --> 35:46.133
YOU'RE THE ASS
WHO GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK.

35:47.867 --> 35:49.767
I'M SO GLAD WE DID THIS.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.700
I AM, TOO. THANK YOU
FOR SUGGESTING IT.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.067
BECAUSE I--

35:53.100 --> 35:54.833
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
IN A MILLION YEARS.

35:54.867 --> 35:56.533
(both laugh)

35:56.567 --> 35:57.733
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

35:57.767 --> 35:59.433
THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

35:59.467 --> 36:00.633
(sighs)

36:00.667 --> 36:03.167
I'M--I'M SORRY
A-ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.367
THANK YOU.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.367
THANKS.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.700
SWING'S STILL HERE.
(chuckles)

36:09.733 --> 36:13.733
YES, IT, UH, DOESN'T SWING.
NOBODY USES IT.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.767
AH.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.600
I PUT THIS IN THERE.

36:22.633 --> 36:24.533
YOU USED TO CATCH
YOUR FINGERS IN IT.

36:24.567 --> 36:26.733
(chuckles)

36:26.767 --> 36:29.067
OH.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.700
(swing squeaking)

36:45.233 --> 36:46.400
(Izzie) SUCK IT UP,

36:46.433 --> 36:48.333
GO BACK WITH YOUR TAIL
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS

36:48.367 --> 36:50.067
AND JUST APOLOGIZE.

36:50.067 --> 36:51.133
NO!

36:51.167 --> 36:53.100
NO, REALLY. LOOK, YOU JUST--
I'M ALWAYS APOLOGIZING.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.067
"I'M SORRY. I'M AN ASS."
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

36:55.067 --> 36:56.767
AND IT'S OVER.
AND THEN IT'S ALL OVER.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.667
NO. NOT REAL--I CAN'T
BE WRONG ALL THE TIME.

36:59.700 --> 37:00.733
(laughs)

37:00.767 --> 37:03.400
IS THAT REALLY POSSIBLE?
DON'T--DON'T FINISH IT.

37:03.433 --> 37:05.400
HEY, DON'T BE GRABBY.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.333
YOU--I DON'T HAVE ANY.
BOGIE.

37:07.367 --> 37:09.233
MAYBE YOU'RE WRONG
ALL THE TIME,

37:09.267 --> 37:10.500
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
REALLY INSECURE.

37:10.533 --> 37:12.433
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU STILL HAVE TO GROVEL.

37:12.467 --> 37:14.267
OH.
DON'T YOU--FILL...

37:14.300 --> 37:15.367
(mutters)

37:15.400 --> 37:17.567
YEAH, UM, SHE'S...

37:17.600 --> 37:19.067
SHE'S INSECURE.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.067
YEAH.

37:20.067 --> 37:21.733
THAT IS A FACT.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.700
SHE'S INSECURE.

37:24.733 --> 37:26.600
WHAT?

37:26.633 --> 37:28.467
WHAT? (laughs)

37:28.500 --> 37:29.667
JUST TELL ME.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.367
(laughs) MNH-MNH.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.567
COME ON.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.533
NO.

37:33.567 --> 37:35.233
COME ON!

37:35.267 --> 37:36.433
(laughs) SHUT UP.

37:36.467 --> 37:37.400
(laughs)

37:37.433 --> 37:39.633
NO, IT'S, UM, JU--
NOTHING.

37:39.667 --> 37:42.133
JUST THAT SHE THINKS
YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME,

37:42.167 --> 37:44.200
LIKE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(laughs)

37:44.233 --> 37:46.133
(laughs) I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S FABULOUS.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.533
NO, AND--AND--AND...
OH, I NEED A TISSUE.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.467
THAT, UH, I-I-I DESPERATELY
WANT YOU.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.267
(laughs)

37:52.300 --> 37:54.533
(both laugh)

37:54.567 --> 37:56.367
(coughs)

37:56.400 --> 37:58.333
I'M CRYING.

37:58.367 --> 37:59.667
I'M CRYING.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.200
(laughs) MMM.

38:01.233 --> 38:03.233
IS SHE CRAZY?

38:03.267 --> 38:04.600
YOU KNOW, I THINK--

38:04.633 --> 38:06.800
I THINK SHE'S MAYBE
A LITTLE CRAZY.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.733
(laughs) OH, CAN'T BREATHE.
SHUT UP.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.767
I CAN'T BREATHE.
SHH.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.367
WE GOTTA BE QUIET. SHH.
SHH.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.567
OW. (laughs)

38:25.100 --> 38:26.267
SCARY DAY, HUH?

38:26.300 --> 38:27.100
YEAH.

38:27.133 --> 38:29.067
WELL,
YOUR AMNIOTIC SAC'S INTACT,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.567
THE PLACENTA'S
IN GOOD POSITION.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.500
DR. MONTGOMERY SEWED
YOUR CERVIX UP SO TIGHT,

38:32.533 --> 38:33.667
NOTHING'S COMING OUTTA THERE.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.467
SO THE BABY'S GONNA BE OKAY?

38:36.500 --> 38:38.367
***

38:38.400 --> 38:40.367
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE
HOW IT GOES.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.333
I'M SORRY.

38:42.367 --> 38:45.200
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT,
AND I TOLD YOU TO GO FOR IT,

38:45.233 --> 38:49.200
AND I'M...
I'M REALLY SORRY.

38:49.233 --> 38:50.667
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

38:50.700 --> 38:53.567
NO, SEE, WHEN I PULLED YOU
OUT OF THAT WATER AT THE FERRY,

38:53.600 --> 38:54.833
I... YOU'RE...

38:54.867 --> 38:57.700

I'M AN INTERN.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.567
YOU GOTTA GET
YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE

39:01.600 --> 39:03.267
FROM AN ATTENDING.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.067
I ASKED YOU
'CAUSE I TRUST YOU.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.233
WHY DON'T YOU SIT
AND TELL ME A BEDTIME STORY

39:09.267 --> 39:10.600
OR SOMETHING?

39:10.633 --> 39:12.133
WHAT'S WORSE,

39:12.167 --> 39:15.600
NEW WOUNDS, WHICH ARE
SO HORRIBLY PAINFUL...

39:15.633 --> 39:16.800
(sighs) MOVE OVER.

39:16.833 --> 39:18.733

OF THE BED.

39:18.767 --> 39:21.400
OR OLD WOUNDS THAT SHOULD'VE
HEALED YEARS AGO

39:26.333 --> 39:28.800

THIS ENGAGEMENT?

39:36.233 --> 39:39.167
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU WANT TO?

39:41.533 --> 39:43.567
I DON'T KNOW.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.500

39:45.533 --> 39:49.200

39:49.233 --> 39:52.767
YEAH, SHE IS.

39:52.800 --> 39:58.067
MAYBE OUR OLD WOUNDS
TEACH US SOMETHING.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.567
THEY REMIND US
OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN

40:00.600 --> 40:03.733
AND WHAT WE'VE OVERCOME.

40:03.767 --> 40:05.633
***

40:05.667 --> 40:10.167
THEY TEACH US LESSONS ABOUT
WHAT TO AVOID IN THE FUTURE.

THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO THINK.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.033
