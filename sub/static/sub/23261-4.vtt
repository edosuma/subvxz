I'd say late teens.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.319
You're going to need this.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.479
His body was found in the water
near the sluice gates. Any ID?

03:54.519 --> 03:58.720
His description fits that of a lad
who was reported missing
three days ago.

03:58.759 --> 04:02.079
Get onto Missing Persons,
see if they can tell us anything.

04:02.119 --> 04:04.639
I will do.
(SIGHS)

04:13.920 --> 04:17.360

that's cleared. What kept you?

Easy Rider up my backside!

04:19.000 --> 04:23.959
I should do you
for dangerous driving.
Well, at least I've made a start!

04:24.959 --> 04:29.360
What have we got? The mechanic pulled
him out of the stilling basin.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.360
Thought he might still be alive.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.600
There's not much chance of that.

04:33.639 --> 04:36.319
I'd say he's been dead
less than 24 hours.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
So some time yesterday.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.479
What are these injuries?
Cuts and lacerations.

04:42.519 --> 04:44.600
Probably post-mortem.

04:44.639 --> 04:49.039
Went for a swim, got out
of his depth, accidental drowning?

04:49.079 --> 04:52.479
This head wound
might suggest otherwise.

04:52.519 --> 04:54.519
Let's have a look.

04:58.479 --> 05:00.920
So, what,
smashed his head when he fell?

05:00.959 --> 05:03.720
Either that or he was struck
with something.

05:03.759 --> 05:06.239
Most of these injuries are linear,

05:06.280 --> 05:10.560
probably from the turbine blades,
but that's a blunt force
trauma wound.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.159
Someone lamps him from behind?
Post-mortem might tell us more.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.680
Ma'am, the chief engineer
would like a word with you.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.759
He's definitely the lad
that went missing.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
Right.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.759
His name was Ethan Dewley.
He lived with his dad.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.680
Same year in college as my lad.
Were they mates?

05:30.720 --> 05:33.759
I wouldn't say that.
It was Alice he knocked about with.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
And who's Alice?
My daughter.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.519
I will need to talk to her, love.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.000
She'll be at the activity centre.
She works there part-time.

05:43.039 --> 05:45.680
Lowmere. Right.

05:48.079 --> 05:51.959
Could he have gone into the stilling
basin from the parapet walkway?

05:52.000 --> 05:55.360
We checked the CCTV.
No sign of anyone there.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.079
So the chances are
he went in from the reservoir.

05:59.119 --> 06:03.959
The body got caught in the runoff,
down through the penstock
and into the turbines.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.519
It doesn't bear thinking about!

06:10.400 --> 06:12.360
(SIGHS) All right.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.200

07:15.600 --> 07:19.800
Mr Dewley, you reported your son
missing on Friday evening.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.280
I was worried when
he didn't come home, you know?

07:23.319 --> 07:26.479
Yes. But when did you last see him?

07:31.479 --> 07:35.039
He left on his bike for college
that morning,

07:35.079 --> 07:38.079
er, the local sixth form.

07:38.119 --> 07:42.039
We checked with the college and, er,

07:42.079 --> 07:44.519
he never made it into class
that morning.

07:44.560 --> 07:49.159
I thought maybe he'd gone to see
his mam. She took off 18 months ago.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.560
She'll need to be told.
Her name's Ellie.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.720
I can do that, if it's easier.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.600
What about his mates?
Erm...

08:07.720 --> 08:10.759
Ethan didn't really have
many friends, you know?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.879
There's the lass over at Lowmere.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.200
Alice, isn't it?
H-He'd spend a bit of time with her.

08:16.239 --> 08:18.759
Ah, not a girlfriend?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.239
No. I mean, he...

08:21.280 --> 08:24.800
He wasn't really into
that kind of stuff, you know?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.720
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

take a look at your son's room, love.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.959

have already done that, love.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.319
Well, it won't harm
to have another look.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.280
So whenever you're ready...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.319
Yeah.

08:59.159 --> 09:02.159
When we've wrapped up,
we'll get in contact with Ellie.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.560
Here! So, it's true
what they're saying, then -

09:05.600 --> 09:09.959
the Dewley lad was murdered?
It's pure speculation, love.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.479
So, why are you lot involved?

09:12.519 --> 09:15.959

Compassionate leave.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.280
We're a few doors down
in the village.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.759
We'll see he's taken care of.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.039
The house is a pigsty.

09:50.079 --> 09:54.239
He clearly hasn't been coping.
It's hardly surprising.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.039
Wife takes off,
leaving them both high and dry.

09:58.079 --> 10:00.800
Why is he still at work
if his lad's gone missing?

10:00.839 --> 10:03.519
Some people like to keep busy,
don't they?

10:03.560 --> 10:07.519
It's better than sitting here
waiting for bad news.

10:10.639 --> 10:13.400
Ethan must've had a laptop.

10:15.159 --> 10:17.920
Missing Persons must've taken that.

doing a flit to you?

it's hard to tell.

hm?

10:40.239 --> 10:43.360

10:43.400 --> 10:47.280

somewhere? (WINCES)

10:51.000 --> 10:53.079
Well, keep looking.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.920
See if there's anything
we can work with.

10:59.039 --> 11:03.759
Now, we need to get a fix on his
movements these missing three days,

11:03.800 --> 11:07.159
so if there's anything
you haven't told us...

11:08.200 --> 11:10.360
No?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.079
OK.

11:12.119 --> 11:14.000
Right.

11:15.519 --> 11:17.319
Erm...

11:22.560 --> 11:25.360
I'd had a few drinks
on the Thursday night.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.280
I got home and crashed out
on the sofa. When I woke up,

11:28.319 --> 11:33.319
his bike was gone and I just assumed
that he'd left for college.

11:33.360 --> 11:38.439
Are you saying you didn't see him
at all on Friday morning?

11:40.560 --> 11:42.800
We'd argued. Something or nothing!

11:42.839 --> 11:45.759
He'd accused me
of being a lousy dad.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.360
He slammed a few doors
and then stormed off.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.959
You should've told us before, love.
And how would that have looked, eh?

11:54.959 --> 11:59.000
My own lad doesn't come home that
night and I'm too drunk to notice.

11:59.039 --> 12:01.400
Ma'am!

12:10.000 --> 12:14.519
A hiker found some clothes
by the lake. Just called it in.

12:21.959 --> 12:26.479
They're definitely Ethan's? Yeah.
We found his wallet in his pocket.

12:26.519 --> 12:31.280
It looks like he did go for a swim.
Folded up his clothes nice and neat.

12:31.319 --> 12:34.439
Folded up his clothes?!

12:36.439 --> 12:40.319
Did you see anything at all
in his bedroom that was folded?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.000
It was like a tip!

12:43.039 --> 12:48.439
Nah, a teenage lad
would've just kicked off his jeans
and left them where they fell.

12:48.479 --> 12:51.200
This all seems too contrived.

12:51.239 --> 12:55.000
Ma'am, you might want to come
and see this!

13:00.039 --> 13:01.879
Traces of blood on this rock.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.560
We're going to run it
for a match with the victim.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.759
So, this is where he fell?
Highly probable.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.560
There's dirt and vegetation
attached to the belt

13:11.600 --> 13:13.360
and scuff marks on the leather.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.759
He was dragged. So someone else
must've undressed him.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.000
Let me get this straight, Marcus,

13:20.039 --> 13:23.879
he was either dead or out cold
when he went into the water?

13:23.920 --> 13:26.560
I'd say so.
I mean, look at these drag marks.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.439
So he's dragged, undressed
and rolled into the lake

13:30.479 --> 13:34.519
and the current
takes him down to the dam.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.360
Now, his dad said he left on his
bike.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.759
Yeah. I haven't found it yet,
but we're going to get these
track marks checked.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.959
Right, I want the perimeter extended
down to the lane!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.959
Let's get this scene owned.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.920
It's a popular beauty spot.

13:52.959 --> 13:56.959
Nice and secluded.
That's what I'm thinking.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.119
Maybe he was meeting someone.

13:59.159 --> 14:02.519
And this someone kills him?
Mm.

14:04.319 --> 14:05.879
And undresses him.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.079
Dumped his body

14:08.119 --> 14:13.839
and then folded his clothes
to make it look like an accident.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.519
Ethan Dewley, 17.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.839
He went missing from home
four days ago.

14:27.879 --> 14:30.600
We're waiting for an update
from Forensics

14:30.639 --> 14:35.119
but we do believe the lad was fatally
assaulted some time last night.

14:35.159 --> 14:37.839
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head,

14:37.879 --> 14:40.720
dumped to make it look like
an accidental drowning.

14:40.759 --> 14:43.879
The blood at the scene
has been confirmed as his.

14:43.920 --> 14:49.119
He's a sixth form college student.
Latchkey teen. Absent mam.

14:49.159 --> 14:53.720
His dad works over
at the local sawmill.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.479
Now, father and son
were clearly at odds.

14:57.519 --> 15:00.839
Social services had recently
paid the Dewleys a visit.

15:00.879 --> 15:02.920
Query - neglect.

15:02.959 --> 15:06.639
Who flagged that up? The college.
Ethan started missing lessons.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.159
We know he didn't get to college
the day he went missing.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.519
Now, the father, Sean Dewley,

15:12.560 --> 15:16.800
has since changed the statement
he gave to Missing Persons.

15:16.839 --> 15:20.119
He did not see his son return home
on Thursday evening.

15:20.159 --> 15:22.159
So, why lie to the police?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.319
That's a good question, Jac.

15:24.360 --> 15:29.680
Witnesses remember seeing Ethan
that Thursday. He was over at
the waterside activity centre.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.360
That's Lowmere.
Some kind of open day?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.600
Last time anyone sees him alive.

15:34.639 --> 15:37.200
His body went into the water
at Byer Crag

15:37.239 --> 15:39.879
and that's, what,
less than a mile from there?

15:39.920 --> 15:43.720
The area would've been full
of visitors, plenty of footfall. Mm.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.600
Now, one thing of note,

15:45.639 --> 15:50.560
his clothes were folded
and that's clearly at odds
with the lad's character,

15:50.600 --> 15:53.879
which suggests somebody else
was involved.

15:53.920 --> 15:58.159
Oh, there's some new intel
on the missing bike, ma'am.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.119
It's a Giant Talon.

16:01.159 --> 16:04.119
You wouldn't get much change
from 500 quid!

16:04.159 --> 16:07.319
I do a bit of trail biking myself.
Yeah?

16:07.360 --> 16:10.759
Next time, take Kenny.
He could do with the exercise!

16:10.800 --> 16:13.759
Where does a 17-year-old lad
get that some of money?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.680
He certainly didn't get it
from his dad. He's skint.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.280
Ethan sees someone
stealing his bike,

16:19.319 --> 16:21.920
puts up a struggle,
gets killed for his trouble.

16:21.959 --> 16:25.720
You're right, we can't rule theft
out. I'm not ruling anything out.

16:25.759 --> 16:29.600
Jac, are there any surveillance
cameras on those bike trails?

16:29.639 --> 16:32.000
They'll have them at muster points.

16:32.039 --> 16:35.600
Follow up witness statements,
then get over to Lowmere,

16:35.639 --> 16:38.400
see if anybody knew the lad.

16:38.439 --> 16:42.119
Anyone wants me,
I'll be down in the basement.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.839
Are you there, George?

16:54.879 --> 16:57.600
(SIGHS) Ethan Dewley...

16:57.639 --> 16:59.879
Oh, you've heard.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.560
I had a bad feeling about this one.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.560
Aye.

17:04.600 --> 17:08.159
Well, we think murdered

17:08.200 --> 17:10.360
sometime last night.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.439
Anything you can tell us?
Not much, I'm afraid.

17:13.479 --> 17:15.800
Dad reported him missing
Friday evening.

17:15.839 --> 17:19.319
Now, we think it was Thursday
he disappeared.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.680
That open day over at Lowmere?

17:21.720 --> 17:24.879
No report sightings after 8pm.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.439
Checked his phone logs, no calls,
no texts.

17:28.479 --> 17:31.800
(SIGHS) It sounds like
he didn't want to be found.

17:31.839 --> 17:35.720
Troubled soul.
Well, his mam had done a bunk.

17:35.759 --> 17:40.560
Ellie Dewley. You got an address?
Er, lives over in South Shields.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.920
I took a statement when Ethan
went missing. Family liaison.

17:44.959 --> 17:48.239
Said she hadn't seen him in weeks.
Do you believe her?

17:48.280 --> 17:51.439
She sounded genuine enough.

17:51.479 --> 17:55.239
Mm. What about his dad
and this run-in with social services?

17:55.280 --> 17:59.319
Sean Dewley, threatened
with an interim care order,

17:59.360 --> 18:01.639
rescinded after Ethan turned 17.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.039
What about the boy's laptop?
Is there anything on that?

18:05.079 --> 18:08.680
It's still over at Tech. Oh.
I'll chase it up. Thanks, George.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.079
Can I take that? No use to us now.
Right.

18:12.119 --> 18:15.079
Right, thanks, love.

18:19.079 --> 18:21.479
'(DRAMATIC MUSIC)'

18:24.159 --> 18:26.959
You might've seen something.

18:43.759 --> 18:47.560
Alice, we know Ethan was seen here
on Thursday evening.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.079
He dropped into the caf.
It must've been around seven.

18:51.119 --> 18:54.319
I'd just started a shift.
Did you see him again after that?

18:54.360 --> 18:57.800
He popped back later,
after the fireworks,

18:57.839 --> 19:00.159
said he was head home.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.560
How did he seem?

19:04.600 --> 19:06.759
A bit subdued.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.280
Had he had any fallouts
leading up to his disappearance?

19:10.319 --> 19:12.479
No-one I can think of.

19:13.479 --> 19:15.800
Didn't confide in you, then,

19:15.839 --> 19:18.639
even though you were friends?

19:18.680 --> 19:22.000
Ethan - he didn't really
share stuff.

19:22.039 --> 19:24.560
He kept himself to himself.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.560
Now, we know he didn't go home
Thursday,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.519
so any guesses
where he might've gone?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.959
We used to go trail biking.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.439
That your bike, is it?
Mm.

19:35.479 --> 19:37.639
Carrera Vengeance. Nice model.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.319
There's a black run up to Darkwater.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.319
The fell at the top of the lake?

19:42.360 --> 19:44.600
He'd sit up there for hours
sometimes.

19:44.639 --> 19:48.519
Bit of a climb.
It's worth it for the 3 dog descent.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.479
Oof! Sounds painful! (CHUCKLES)

19:51.519 --> 19:56.479
I'd like you to give DC Williams
the names of all your guests
over the weekend.

19:56.519 --> 20:00.280
I need names, addresses
and the dates they booked in.

20:00.319 --> 20:03.079
I'm sorry about your friend.

20:05.479 --> 20:07.400
Whenever you're ready.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.959
This is Jim Briscoe,
senior park ranger.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.079
He's been the first point of contact
for Missing Persons. DCI Stanhope.

20:18.119 --> 20:22.720
I'm afraid we're now treating
this lad's death as suspicious.

20:22.759 --> 20:26.159
Right. Is that why you've
cordoned off that area at Byer Crag?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.200
Yeah. We think that's where
he went into the water.

20:29.239 --> 20:31.319
Poor lad.
Mm.

20:31.360 --> 20:36.200
Now, some of these boats,
were they on the lake yesterday?
Maybe someone saw something.

20:36.239 --> 20:39.800
There's a log at the visitors
centre. It's rentals and permits.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.560
I'll follow that up, ma'am.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.439
The police asking questions, it's
not going to be good for business.

20:48.479 --> 20:52.680
I'm afraid we can't help that, sir,
but we will try to contain it.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.839
Kervendene relies on tourism.
Mm.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.439
And a lot of our workforce
are volunteers.

20:58.479 --> 21:02.200
Any of those volunteers
working over at Byer Crag yesterday?

21:02.239 --> 21:05.319
A few of the lads
were repairing a wall.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.680
If you'd like,
I can drive you over there.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.959
Yeah, grand!

21:14.720 --> 21:17.200
Did you know this lad personally?

21:17.239 --> 21:20.280
Bit of a loner by all accounts.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.119
Didn't see him on Thursday
at the open day?

21:25.159 --> 21:27.000
Not that I remember.

21:27.039 --> 21:28.759
I was busy.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.200
(GUNSHOTS)
Ooh, hear that?

21:31.239 --> 21:33.039
That's Pride Bank Ranges.

21:33.079 --> 21:35.800
You can hear the gunfire
from 20 miles away.

21:35.839 --> 21:40.479
Of course! Most of this land
is Ministry of Defence, isn't it?

21:41.600 --> 21:44.839
Were there any army manoeuvres
going on yesterday?

21:44.879 --> 21:47.360
I know the cadets
have been training.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.639
Adam!

22:06.680 --> 22:09.280
You can leave that for five minutes.

22:09.319 --> 22:12.519
There's a detective here
would like a word with you.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.839
All right?

22:13.879 --> 22:15.920
I'll go and check on progress.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.639
Hey, that looks like hard work.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.560
The sooner it's finished...
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:21.600 --> 22:24.439
(BIRD TWEETS)

22:24.479 --> 22:27.439
We've got a few ospreys nesting.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.479
Ah!

22:30.800 --> 22:33.560
You're keeping an eye for 'em,
are you?

22:33.600 --> 22:36.600
She's been nesting for a month now.

22:36.639 --> 22:39.439
The first egg will hatch
in a week or two.

22:39.479 --> 22:41.639
Brown speckles.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.439
(CHUCKLES)
First-timers, I reckon.

22:44.479 --> 22:46.920
Well, they'll be learning on the job.

22:46.959 --> 22:51.079
Now, you will have heard
about Ethan Dewley.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.360
Aye, I heard.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.839
He was murdered not far from here
some time yesterday evening.

22:58.879 --> 23:03.239
I just wondered if you saw
anything suspicious.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.879
Can't say I did.

23:04.920 --> 23:08.119
Nothing in the woods, on the road?

23:09.439 --> 23:11.400
Truth be told,

23:11.439 --> 23:13.400
I skived off early.

23:13.439 --> 23:16.360
Went swimming over at Bayford Shank.
Ah.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.239
Anyone with you?
Just a few mates.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.119
Was Ethan a mate?

23:21.159 --> 23:24.119
I'd run into him a sometimes
at the village.

23:24.159 --> 23:27.800
Kervendene Village?
You live there, too, do you?

23:27.839 --> 23:30.959
Everyone knows the Jannens' place.
Jannen?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.680
Your mam and dad run the saw mill.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.519
Aye, that's right.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.360
Course, Ethan's dad works there, too.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.479
So, what if he does?

23:44.079 --> 23:47.360
That's a nasty graze
you've got there.

23:49.759 --> 23:52.000
Tore the skin
on one of these stones.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.959
You want to get something
put on that!

23:58.079 --> 24:03.239
We'll need this finished
before dark. Oh, right!
Well, you better get back to it.

24:48.119 --> 24:52.600
Now, you told me you saw Ethan
six weeks ago.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.600
Er, yeah. Erm...

24:56.639 --> 24:59.639
It was the first time in months.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.879
And why was that?

25:03.959 --> 25:06.800
Ethan blamed us
for walking out on them,

25:06.839 --> 25:09.439
leaving him with his dad.

25:09.479 --> 25:12.560
I was gonna go back for him,
you know!

25:12.600 --> 25:16.639
As soon as
I'd just got myself straight!

25:21.239 --> 25:25.479
Now, his dad says Ethan was...

25:26.479 --> 25:28.159
..angry about something.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.200
Do you know what that was?

25:30.239 --> 25:35.039
Ethan, he didn't get on
with the kids in the village.

25:35.079 --> 25:37.720
Some of the lads,
they liked to pick on him.

25:37.759 --> 25:42.159
Which lads are these?
Adam Jannen and his mates.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.560
I came across Adam Jannen yesterday.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.039
He said he hardly knew Ethan.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.920
Well, he would say that,
wouldn't he?

25:52.959 --> 25:56.439
The lad's got a bad reputation.

25:56.479 --> 25:58.680
I'll check it out.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.920
I warned Ethan's dad
to look out for him!

26:04.959 --> 26:08.879
Not that it did any good.
(DOOR CLOSES)

26:10.119 --> 26:14.759
Would you say your husband
had a problem with alcohol?

26:15.879 --> 26:19.280
It only really became a problem
when the marriage broke down.

26:19.319 --> 26:20.639
(SIGHS)

26:20.680 --> 26:23.680
So, that's not why you left him?

26:27.079 --> 26:32.039
Sean was unfaithful.
He said that it only happened once

26:32.079 --> 26:35.560
but I couldn't even look at him
after that.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.800
And did Ethan know about that?

26:40.839 --> 26:46.119
Sean begged us not to tell him
but Ethan thought that
I'd walked out over nothing!

26:46.159 --> 26:50.079
I couldn't bear him hating us,
I didn't deserve that!

26:50.119 --> 26:52.839
So, when did he find out?

26:52.879 --> 26:55.639
The last time that I saw him!

26:56.959 --> 27:00.879
I sat him down
and I told him everything!

27:03.879 --> 27:07.280
Is this other woman
someone we should know about?

27:36.119 --> 27:38.119
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

27:48.839 --> 27:51.759
Is your son at home?

27:56.720 --> 27:59.800
It was just a bit of banter,
that's all.

27:59.839 --> 28:02.200
Well, Ethan's mam says different.

28:02.239 --> 28:04.519
Ellie Dewley's
the one making trouble.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.920
She always had it in for Adam!

28:06.959 --> 28:10.239
Well, maybe she had reason.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.360
Previous for violent affray!

28:13.400 --> 28:16.000
This volunteer work,

28:16.039 --> 28:19.839
that's a condition
of your three-month probation order!

28:19.879 --> 28:23.400
I'm trying to get myself straight.
Start with straight answers.

28:23.439 --> 28:26.400
Now, take us back through Sunday.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.119
You skive off work early,

28:28.159 --> 28:30.200
go swimming with these mates.

28:30.239 --> 28:33.159
So, how are you getting home?
Si dropped us back here.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.879
Si? Which Si is this?

28:35.920 --> 28:37.680
Simon Whenchurch.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.119
Any relation to Alice?

28:40.159 --> 28:42.439
Brother and sister.

28:44.079 --> 28:47.239
What time did he drop you off?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.519
Must've been around...

28:49.560 --> 28:52.720
..six? I can vouch for that.
He was in all night.

28:52.759 --> 28:56.800
Well, he'd need to be
to comply with the home curfew.

28:56.839 --> 29:00.079
(DOOR CLOSES)
Glenda!

29:04.759 --> 29:06.959
What's this?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.400
The police were just leaving.

29:11.239 --> 29:14.200
Not before they tell us why
they're in my kitchen.

29:14.239 --> 29:17.479
We had to ask your son
some questions.

29:17.519 --> 29:19.479
What have you done now?

29:19.519 --> 29:21.479
Nothing!

29:21.519 --> 29:24.319
We know he'd been bullying
Ethan Dewley.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.119
Chip off the old block, eh?

29:27.159 --> 29:31.600
Oh, I get it. First sign of trouble,
blame the Jannens.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.600
Just leave it, Owen.

29:35.839 --> 29:39.519
As soon as you finish
that probation,
you're back at the saw mill.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.439
I didn't do anything wrong!

29:42.479 --> 29:45.000
You heard him.

29:46.039 --> 29:48.680
You know where the door is.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.560
What else did Ellie tell you?
Enough.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.479
Unless there's something
you'd like to add?

30:09.519 --> 30:11.720
Owen can never find out.

30:11.759 --> 30:15.000
If he did, he'd kill us both.

30:15.039 --> 30:18.600
Glenda! Get in here!

30:18.639 --> 30:21.800
He won't be hearing it from me, love.

30:33.239 --> 30:36.839
Glenda Jannen's carrying on
with Ethan's dad,

30:36.879 --> 30:40.720
Ethan finds out, he tells Adam, but
Adam's already got it in for him.

30:40.759 --> 30:42.600
I tell you one thing,

30:42.639 --> 30:45.239
she's covering for her son.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.959
Lying through her teeth!

Adam Jannen says he was dropped off
at six on Sunday night

31:03.200 --> 31:05.920
by his mate Simon Whenchurch.

31:05.959 --> 31:08.839

about that.

Sir.

31:26.039 --> 31:28.920
DS Aiden Healy,
Northumberland and City Police.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.119
Are you here about the dead lad?

31:32.360 --> 31:36.759
Your junior cadets were out
playing war games at the weekend.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.720
Is it possible this lad
could've got caught up in it?

31:39.759 --> 31:43.400
The cadets are under
adult supervision at all times.

31:43.439 --> 31:46.000
I better tell these cadets
to stand down.

31:46.039 --> 31:49.800
There's one other we'd like
to talk to. Simon Whenchurch?

31:55.720 --> 31:59.280
You and Adam Jannen
spent Sunday afternoon together?

31:59.319 --> 32:02.119
Yeah.
We were messing about by the lake.

32:02.159 --> 32:04.360
And you drove him back teatime?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.479
Dropped him off around... six.

32:06.519 --> 32:09.039
Are you sure about that?
Yeah.

32:09.079 --> 32:12.879
It was lashing it down.
I packed up early. Hm.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.720
Did you see anyone acting
suspiciously on your way home?

32:16.759 --> 32:18.079
Not that I remember.

32:18.119 --> 32:23.200
Well, can you try remembering
a little bit harder, love?

32:24.959 --> 32:27.119
There was one fella.

32:27.159 --> 32:30.479
He was parked in a blue van.
Would you recognise this fella?

32:30.519 --> 32:34.079
Maybe. I mean, it was getting dark.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.600
Did you see Ethan Dewley?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.039
No. He'd gone missing.

32:39.079 --> 32:43.639
I only ask
because your mate had it in for him.

32:45.479 --> 32:49.519
I know they never got on,
but I never really
had much to do with Ethan.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.680
No? He knocked about
with your sister.

32:52.720 --> 32:57.200
Accusations of bullying
won't go down well at Sandhurst.

32:57.239 --> 32:59.280
Yeah, I just got your message.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.759
Look, I need to impress
with the AOSB.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.920
And what's that when it's at home?

33:07.959 --> 33:10.439
Army Officer Selection Board.

33:10.479 --> 33:14.839
Well, if you've told us the truth,
you've got nothing to worry about.

33:16.360 --> 33:20.079
That's my ride back to the barracks.
All right, fall in.

33:20.119 --> 33:23.079
One-two, one-two.

33:23.119 --> 33:25.800
There's something flagged up
on the event log.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.479
A woman reported a break-in
four days ago.

33:28.519 --> 33:31.319
Her cottage is not far
from the crime scene.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.400
Right.

33:33.439 --> 33:36.879
Come on, let's go check it out.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.479
I came home
to find the back door kicked in,

33:50.519 --> 33:54.280
some food from the fridge had gone,
cash off the table.

33:54.319 --> 33:58.000
They'd been through the drawers.
There's a photograph missing,

33:58.039 --> 34:01.439
a picture of me, in a silver frame
on the dressing table.

34:01.479 --> 34:03.920
I didn't think you'd follow it up.
Ah, now,

34:03.959 --> 34:08.479
we're investigating the death
of that lad who went missing.

34:08.519 --> 34:10.280
I heard they'd found a body.

34:10.319 --> 34:11.680
Can I ask,

34:11.720 --> 34:14.000
do you live here alone?
Yeah.

34:14.039 --> 34:17.280
It's just me.
Mm. Lovely!

34:17.319 --> 34:19.079
Middle of nowhere!

34:19.119 --> 34:22.319
Mm. I moved here
because it felt safe.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.319
Where did you move from? Sunderland.
I taught art in a comp there.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.400
Ah, well,
this is a bit of a change for you.

34:29.439 --> 34:31.959
I'm only renting. Six-month lease.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.879
I needed a break from the grind.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.959
And the light here's
perfect for painting. Oh, aye.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.639
Now, the last thing we want to do,
love, is alarm you,

34:42.680 --> 34:46.560
but we've reason to believe that
these two crimes might be related.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.560
You didn't see anybody
acting suspiciously, did you,

34:49.600 --> 34:52.319
the day leading up to the break-in?

34:52.360 --> 34:57.119
Well, this might sound
like I'm being paranoid, erm,

34:57.159 --> 35:00.439
but it feels like
I've been watched for a while now.

35:00.479 --> 35:03.400
I didn't mention it to anyone.
Just a feeling.

35:03.439 --> 35:08.439
I tell you what we'll do,
we'll have a nosey around outside
and see if we can see anything.

35:08.479 --> 35:11.119
I wouldn't want to waste your time.
Ahh!

35:11.159 --> 35:13.839
Put your mind at rest.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.839
What are we looking for?
I don't know!

35:20.879 --> 35:23.159
Probably nothing.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.479
A woman living on her own,
eyes and ears can play tricks on you.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.280
What?
My lips are sealed.

'(EERIE MUSIC)'

35:42.159 --> 35:44.200
Aiden.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.920
Seems she had a right
to be concerned.

35:50.959 --> 35:54.560
Someone's been stood here,
watching the house.

35:55.560 --> 35:59.280
With a very good view of that window.

36:02.079 --> 36:07.680
Ethan died from a catastrophic
fracture to the second
and third cervical vertebrae.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.280
So falls backwards, bangs his head
and breaks his neck.

36:12.319 --> 36:14.720
Can't be certain
but it's a likely scenario.

36:14.759 --> 36:17.200
"What about his clothes? Anything?"

36:17.239 --> 36:19.680
We lifted touch DNA from the zipper.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.200
Somebody definitely undressed him?
"Yes."

36:22.239 --> 36:24.519
But there aren't enough cells
for an ID.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.479
So, nothing we can work with?

36:27.519 --> 36:31.360
We did trace X and Y chromosomes,
so whoever undressed him was male.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.839
Right. Thanks, Marcus.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.479
'(SOMBRE MUSIC)'

37:12.239 --> 37:15.800
Laura Halcombe was burgled
on Saturday evening.

37:15.839 --> 37:20.159
She lives at Bewesford, which isn't
far from our murder scene.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.839
There was food, cash
and a photo in a silver frame taken.

37:23.879 --> 37:27.639
Sounds like someone's
sleeping rough. Homeless, addict?

37:27.680 --> 37:32.119
There's been a recent spate of theft
in the Kervendene area, ma'am.

37:32.159 --> 37:34.639
Cameras, wallets, mobile phones.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.039
The victims are mainly
park visitors.

37:37.079 --> 37:40.680
We're checking shoeprints from
both scenes for a possible link.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.839
Anything from Forensics
on these fag ends?

37:43.879 --> 37:45.479
I'll chase it up, ma'am.

37:45.519 --> 37:49.319
We've got a possible lead
from the hostel, ma'am. What?

37:49.360 --> 37:53.600
A guest checked out early Sunday
evening, seemed in a hurry.
Vinnie Tidwell.

37:53.639 --> 37:57.000
Applied for a Kervendene
fishing permit,

37:57.039 --> 37:59.439
though he spent most of his time
at the inn.

37:59.479 --> 38:03.200
We ran his name through the PNC.
Previous for domestic burglary.

38:03.239 --> 38:07.400
We're going to need more than that.
Hang on! Is this his vehicle?

38:07.439 --> 38:09.639
Yeah, parked at the guest car park.

38:09.680 --> 38:14.159
What was it that cadet,
Si Whenchurch, said
about seeing someone shifty?

38:14.200 --> 38:17.319
He just said he was loitering
by the road, parked up.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.039
Aye, in a blue van!

38:20.079 --> 38:22.600
Get your coat.

38:34.239 --> 38:38.039
Have a word with the bar staff,
see if they call tell you anything.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.360
Couldn't stand us a pint, could you?
I'm a bit short.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.119
Loosen your tongue, will it?

38:54.159 --> 38:57.119
What's that supposed to mean?

38:57.159 --> 39:01.800
You told me you argued with Ethan
the day he disappeared.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.079
Yeah, I... I'd had a few drinks.
Ah.

39:05.119 --> 39:08.439
Well, it wasn't about something
or nothing, was it?

39:08.479 --> 39:11.959
You've been carrying on
with Glenda Jannen.

39:13.439 --> 39:18.400
That's no concern of yours.
Ah, you'd be dead right there, pet.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.759
Unless, of course,
it's relevant to this murder case.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.800
It only happened the once.

39:23.839 --> 39:27.639
It didn't mean anything. Well,
I doubt Ethan felt the same way.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.800
He blamed his mam for clearing off,
all the while the blame lay with you!

39:31.839 --> 39:34.519
We'd been working through it, OK?

39:35.639 --> 39:39.079
And why didn't you tell me
your son had been bullied?

39:39.119 --> 39:41.479
Didn't think it was important. What?

39:41.519 --> 39:45.119
When Glenda Jannen's lad
was involved?

39:47.119 --> 39:49.280
Sounds like a conflict of interest.

39:49.319 --> 39:52.800
Look, I messed up my marriage

39:52.839 --> 39:55.000
and now I've lost my boy,

39:55.039 --> 39:58.839
so why don't you just let me be, eh?

40:02.239 --> 40:04.600
I do know one thing, love.

40:04.639 --> 40:07.239
That's not going to help.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.400
Anything? Barmaid remembers him,
this Vinnie Tidwell.

40:13.439 --> 40:18.000
A customer accused him
of nicking a phone on Friday night.
A squaddie chased him off.

40:18.039 --> 40:19.920
So, where's this fella now?

40:19.959 --> 40:24.000
I've run his plates.
It's a Newcastle address. NE16.

40:24.039 --> 40:27.039
That's Swalbridge. Come on.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.600

you're gonna find! Stand back, son.

41:16.639 --> 41:19.000
In you go.

41:23.039 --> 41:25.839
Ooh! Been away?

41:25.879 --> 41:30.119
What if I have? I'd have thought
you'd be a bit old for hostels.

41:30.159 --> 41:32.239
Ma'am?

41:45.200 --> 41:48.879
I found it. In the woods.
Looked as if someone had dumped it.

41:48.920 --> 41:53.319
A £500 bike? If someone's
daft enough to leave it,
they're asking for trouble.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.639
Were they also asking
to be found dead?

41:56.680 --> 42:00.280
Having this bike puts you
right in the frame for their murder!

42:00.319 --> 42:02.079
Hold on a minute!

42:02.119 --> 42:05.959
I might've got form
for the odd theft. Hm!

42:06.000 --> 42:07.759
Violence isn't my style!

42:07.800 --> 42:11.000
Ethan Dewley...

42:11.039 --> 42:14.600
Now, I think you came across this lad
down by the lake,

42:14.639 --> 42:18.200
you tried to nick his bike,
there's a violent struggle,

42:18.239 --> 42:21.079
one ends up with a broken neck,
the other does a runner.

42:21.119 --> 42:23.439
I never clapped eyes on him!

42:30.920 --> 42:35.000
Our forensics team
have lifted some fingerprints.

42:35.039 --> 42:36.959
We'll soon know if you're lying.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.200
We're charging you with theft.

42:40.239 --> 42:44.600
But if I find any evidence
that puts you at our murder scene,

42:44.639 --> 42:48.439
theft is going to be
the least of your worries.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.560
D'you know, it grieves me to say it,
but he's got a point.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.119
Petty theft's one thing,

43:02.159 --> 43:05.759
murder's something else.
That's an understatement.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.519
Ma'am, Vinnie's shoeprints don't
match any found at the murder scene

43:11.560 --> 43:13.600
or Laura Halcombe's house.

43:13.639 --> 43:17.680
They're still running the DNA
on those cigarette butts, ma'am.

Vinnie Tidwell smokes rollups.

43:20.839 --> 43:23.119
Bad time?

43:23.159 --> 43:27.360
Eee, no, George! Come on in! We could
do with a bit of fresh inspiration.

Jac, this is PC Wooten,

43:29.920 --> 43:32.839
Missing Persons.

43:33.959 --> 43:36.839
So, what have you got for us?
Er, Ethan's laptop.

43:36.879 --> 43:41.039
I thought I'd better share
what we found. Oh, right.

43:43.759 --> 43:46.959
He'd been using
an internet chat room.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.280
Reservoir Dogs.
A chat room?

43:49.319 --> 43:51.519
These members are currently online.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.759
You can chat to friends,
you meet, get talking...

43:55.800 --> 43:59.119
If they've all got
these profile names,

43:59.159 --> 44:03.319
nobody actually knows who you are,
right? Exactly.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.759
So, could Ethan have met his killer
online?

44:06.800 --> 44:11.519
It's a long shot, but we know he was
last logged in three days ago.

44:11.560 --> 44:14.039
A few hours before he was murdered.

44:14.079 --> 44:17.800
George, you are a diamond!

44:17.839 --> 44:20.400
I wouldn't know about that.

44:20.439 --> 44:23.920
What about these files?
Some of them are encrypted.

44:23.959 --> 44:26.800
Well, get Tech
to pull their fingers out!

44:26.839 --> 44:29.680
I'll get on to the chat room
administrator, ma'am.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.319
I'll access his private messages.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.800
I'll, er, leave this with you, then.
Yeah, thanks, George.

44:36.959 --> 44:41.119
You know where I am if you need us.
Aye, I do.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.280
Eh? You know where I am
if you need us, eh? Ooh!

44:51.319 --> 44:53.959
Something I missed?
Gorgeous George!

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
He's got a fancy for the boss. No!
Ah, grow up, will you?

44:59.920 --> 45:01.839
That's great, thank you.

45:01.879 --> 45:06.479
Ma'am, we've got a witness
at the front desk, a guest
that was staying at the hostel.

45:06.519 --> 45:09.200
Says she saw Ethan Dewley
on the day he died.

45:13.439 --> 45:16.119
We met a couple of the lads
on the open day.

45:16.159 --> 45:19.720
They drove us back to the lake
on Sunday.

45:19.759 --> 45:24.479
It started to rain. Erm, me and Adam
went under the trees for shelter.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.000
And he started trying it on,
you know.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
That's when we saw him.

45:31.039 --> 45:34.319
It looked like he was watching us.
Are you sure it was this lad?

45:35.839 --> 45:38.519
He were wearing a hoodie,
but I saw his face.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.479
He took off on his bike
when we clocked him.

45:41.519 --> 45:43.680
And what time was this?

45:43.720 --> 45:45.959
Late afternoon, early evening.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.479
The lads dropped us back
at the hostel to dry off.

45:56.079 --> 45:58.439
He's dead, isn't he?
He is, love.

45:58.479 --> 46:00.519
He was murdered.

46:05.439 --> 46:09.720
So... if there's something
you're not telling us...

46:16.200 --> 46:20.800
It's just that...
when Adam clocked him watching,

46:20.839 --> 46:23.439
he tore off after him.

46:23.479 --> 46:27.400
And... he came back all fired up.

46:30.039 --> 46:34.479
Now, we've got a statement
from a Tanya Beltran,

46:34.519 --> 46:38.039
claims she saw Ethan Dewley
the day he was murdered.

46:38.079 --> 46:40.720
What's that got to do with us?

46:40.759 --> 46:43.879
Because she was fighting off
your advances at the time.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.879
Now, if she can recognise him
from a photograph,

46:47.920 --> 46:51.680
surely you must've known
that was Ethan who was watching you.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.639
OK. I should've come forward.

46:58.680 --> 47:01.639
Now, that is the first sensible thing
he has said.

47:01.680 --> 47:05.319
So why didn't you?
I knew you'd try and pin it on me.

47:07.759 --> 47:10.600
When did you find out Ethan was dead?

47:10.639 --> 47:14.319
Si rang us Monday morning.
Said his dad had found a body.

47:14.360 --> 47:18.439
Simon gave you the heads up, did he?
Why would he do that?

47:18.479 --> 47:23.600
Because he knew you'd been putting
the frighteners on Ethan
when you saw him at that open day.

47:23.639 --> 47:28.200
And don't insult me with denials,
love. I know you were there.

47:35.200 --> 47:39.000
He'd been spreading rumours.
About your mam and his dad.

47:39.039 --> 47:40.800
We know about that.

47:45.079 --> 47:47.600
I warned him off, that's all.

47:47.639 --> 47:51.959
Told him to shut his mouth.
Or what, you'd shut it for him?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.920
That day at Bayford Shank
was the last time I saw him.

47:55.959 --> 47:59.680
(SIGHS) Well, in view of all the lies
you've been telling me, love,

47:59.720 --> 48:02.639
you can see why I'm not convinced.

48:33.079 --> 48:37.079
I called in at your office,
they told me I'd find you here. Aye.

48:37.119 --> 48:40.119
We've been trying to encourage
some biodiversity.

Felling the conifers
from the glades.

48:43.879 --> 48:47.639
Well, we've had a breakthrough
in this murder case.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.639
We're holding Adam Jannen
as a person of interest.

48:50.680 --> 48:54.879
Adam's not a bad sort.
He's on probation for violent affray.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.720
Adam... just needs someone
to believe in him.

49:00.039 --> 49:03.079
What about his mate,
Simon Whenchurch?

49:03.119 --> 49:05.879
Si doesn't need any help
in that department.

49:06.920 --> 49:11.360
You know, Adam... worships
the ground he walks on.

49:18.319 --> 49:21.000
did you know she was burgled
on Saturday?

49:21.039 --> 49:23.239
Yeah, it was me
that called the police.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.560
And neglected to mention it?

49:26.560 --> 49:30.239
She'd given them a statement.
I didn't think it was relevant.

49:30.280 --> 49:32.319
Have you found out
who broke in, then?

49:32.360 --> 49:35.000
Well, we're working on it.

50:06.639 --> 50:08.400
(BELL RINGS)

50:08.439 --> 50:11.959
You were supposed to be studying!
I went for a swim. That's all!

50:12.000 --> 50:15.800
Oh, I don't think that's quite all,
was it, love?

50:15.839 --> 50:21.519
Adam Jannen admitted
he saw Ethan Dewley
down by the lake the day he died.

50:22.639 --> 50:25.360
What?
So either you saw him, too,

50:25.400 --> 50:29.239
or Adam mentioned it.
No, he... he didn't say anything.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.639
You called Adam
to say Ethan's body had been found.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.600
So?
So, why did you do that?

50:36.839 --> 50:39.200
Maybe you've been covering for him.

50:39.239 --> 50:42.400
You think he'd jeopardise his future
for the likes of Adam?

50:42.439 --> 50:44.680
No, I'm not covering for anyone.

50:44.720 --> 50:48.280
Your name's come up twice
in the course of this investigation.

50:48.319 --> 50:51.959
I warned you. What's it gonna
look like with the selection board?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.800
It's nothing to do with me!
The chance of a lifetime.

50:54.839 --> 50:59.119
Yeah, so you keep telling me.
Commissioned officer.
A proper army career.

50:59.159 --> 51:01.879
In the forces yourself,
were you, sir?

51:02.879 --> 51:05.519
I took dependency discharge
after my wife died.

51:05.560 --> 51:09.000
Single father.
Two young kids to look after.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.039
So on Sunday, the pair of you
drove back from the lake.

51:17.079 --> 51:21.439
What time was that?
I've already told you.
Well, I'd like you to tell me again.

51:21.479 --> 51:25.000
We parked up around 5.30, dropped
those girls back at the hostel

51:25.039 --> 51:28.079
and then...
I dropped Adam off after that.

51:28.119 --> 51:32.839
In Kervendene Village. He jumped out
at Pride Bank crossroads.

51:32.879 --> 51:35.200
Said there was somewhere
he needed to be.

51:46.800 --> 51:51.200
I've just told your dad,
we've arrested Adam Jannen.

51:55.519 --> 51:58.759
Your brother's all set for the army,
then?

52:00.200 --> 52:02.959
I expect you'll miss him
when he's gone.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.119
I won't be far behind him.

52:06.119 --> 52:08.600
Not that anyone here will notice.

52:08.639 --> 52:12.680
Look, I know what it's like
growing up without your mam.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.759
It's hard.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.000
After she died, we moved here.

52:18.639 --> 52:20.759
Is that when you met Ethan?

52:26.000 --> 52:30.519
We know he was a member
of one of these online chat sites.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.560
Goes under the name
of Reservoir Dogs.

52:33.600 --> 52:38.639
Did he ever mention meeting someone
on one of those forums?

52:39.920 --> 52:42.439
Not that I remember.

52:45.920 --> 52:49.159
Now, we've checked his phone log

52:49.200 --> 52:53.360
and those days he was missing,
he had no calls and no texts.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.759
I... I wouldn't know.

52:59.680 --> 53:02.959
Why didn't you call him, text him,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.360
make sure he was OK,
if he's your mate?

53:06.560 --> 53:11.920
I was angry. You know, he just
takes off, not a word to anyone.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.720
I just wanted him back.

53:18.159 --> 53:20.200
Safe and sound.

53:40.519 --> 53:44.759
I wanna see my son! You can see him
once he's answered all my questions.

53:44.800 --> 53:47.119
You can't keep him locked up!

53:48.200 --> 53:52.400
He lied about his whereabouts,
he lied about seeing Ethan Dewley,

53:52.439 --> 53:55.079
and I think you've been lying
to cover for him.

53:56.720 --> 54:00.119
I was trying to protect him.
If you want to help Adam,

54:00.159 --> 54:03.519
you can start
by telling us the truth.

54:09.479 --> 54:13.079
Adam Jannen didn't get home
until after 8pm.

54:13.119 --> 54:15.519
His mam's just changed her statement.

54:15.560 --> 54:19.879
Now, his mate drops him here
at these crossroads at 6pm,

54:19.920 --> 54:24.439
and that's just a 15-minute walk
to where Ethan was murdered.

54:24.479 --> 54:28.839
We've got no evidence
to place him at the crime scene.
We'll have to find some.

54:28.879 --> 54:33.479
Er, sorry to interrupt, ma'am.
Those fag butts outside
Laura Halcombe's house,

54:33.519 --> 54:36.720
Adam Jannen's DNA's all over them.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.959
A house in Bewesford was burgled
on Saturday night.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.959
You may know it.
Why would I?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.720
Because you'd been over there
casing the place.

54:47.759 --> 54:50.280
Your fags ends are everywhere.

54:52.119 --> 54:55.800
Break in, did you?
No.

54:55.839 --> 54:58.479
I went over to Bewesford to see her,
that's all.

54:58.519 --> 55:00.479
Laura Halcombe?

55:04.079 --> 55:06.680
We've been together
for a couple of months now.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.720
Now, let me get this straight, love.

55:08.759 --> 55:12.720
The pair of you
are in a relationship?

55:12.759 --> 55:14.839
Hooked up on the internet.

55:14.879 --> 55:17.560
Ooh, dating site.
Local chat room.

55:17.600 --> 55:20.759
Things... moved on from there.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.439
And just how far
have things moved on?

55:26.280 --> 55:28.479
That's my business.

55:28.519 --> 55:31.959
Well, you can see why I'm concerned.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.079
You're only 17.

55:35.159 --> 55:37.680
You see? People like you...

55:39.400 --> 55:41.039
..passing judgement.

55:42.039 --> 55:44.039
This is why we decided to wait.

55:44.079 --> 55:49.159
You say this has been going on
for a couple of months. Either
something's gone on or it hasn't.

55:49.200 --> 55:51.239
So which is it?

55:51.280 --> 55:53.759
It was all online.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.879
It's different these days.

55:59.200 --> 56:02.119
You've never even met the woman,
have you, love?

56:10.759 --> 56:13.239
I'd seen her around in the village.

56:13.280 --> 56:17.200
This relationship, love,
it's all in your head.

56:17.239 --> 56:19.239
It was real, OK?

56:21.400 --> 56:23.439
(SIGHS)

56:27.200 --> 56:30.519
Were you at that house
on Sunday evening?

56:34.920 --> 56:37.920
I asked you a question, love.

56:40.039 --> 56:42.920
She messaged us on Sunday morning.

56:42.959 --> 56:45.800
So I was all set
to knock on the door.

56:47.959 --> 56:51.039
And then he showed up.
Who showed up?

56:53.839 --> 56:55.800
Jim Briscoe.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.400
(KNOCKS ON DOOR) Ma'am, we've
uploaded Adam's chat room messages.

57:07.439 --> 57:11.119
Now, is that the same chat room
that Ethan used? Reservoir Dogs.

57:11.159 --> 57:15.839
His username was Top Gun? Top Gun.
Well, nothing if not predictable.

57:15.879 --> 57:18.119
Er, sexually explicit conversations

57:18.159 --> 57:21.319
between Top Gun and another member
of the chat room.

57:21.360 --> 57:24.720
Calls herself The Art Teacher.

57:24.759 --> 57:27.159
There's also an attachment
on his phone.

57:27.200 --> 57:30.119
Female pornographic selfie.
It's fairly explicit.

57:30.159 --> 57:32.400
Photo's been cropped
to hide her face.

57:32.439 --> 57:35.119
If her face is cropped,
it could be anyone. Yeah.

57:35.159 --> 57:37.639
But look what I found in his wallet.

57:40.759 --> 57:46.639
Laura Halcombe's background check.
That comprehensive school in
Sunderland, she left under a cloud.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.800
Inappropriate relationship
with a sixth form student.

57:53.039 --> 57:57.239
I think we need to pay this
Art Teacher another little visit.

58:04.639 --> 58:07.439
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
Hello?

58:07.479 --> 58:10.680
Oh. We were just headed out.
Drink in the village.

58:12.800 --> 58:16.159
Oh, are you two...
Yeah.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.400
A few months now. We thought
we'd keep it to ourselves.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.959
Well, this will be of interest
to both of you.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.479
We know who's been watching
your house. Adam Jannen.

58:27.519 --> 58:29.239
Adam?

58:29.280 --> 58:33.680
Mm. How well do you know him?
I've barely said two words to him.

58:34.879 --> 58:37.560
Well, I think we better finish this
in private.

58:37.600 --> 58:39.680
I've got nothing to hide from Jim.

58:40.680 --> 58:43.959
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll just come out with it.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.400
Adam claims you've been sending him
intimate messages.

58:47.439 --> 58:50.079
What?
This is a wind-up, right?

58:50.119 --> 58:52.439
Did you take this photo?

58:58.479 --> 59:01.720
This is supposed to be me?
Mm. A little selfie.

59:02.720 --> 59:06.280
You can check for yourself
if you don't believe me.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.959
Well, do you recognise this one?

59:11.000 --> 59:14.200
That's the picture that was framed
on the dressing table.

59:14.239 --> 59:17.839
So clearly Adam broke in
and stole it. We know he's got form.

59:17.879 --> 59:20.039
You've changed your tune.

59:20.079 --> 59:22.839
Whatever he's told you,
he's made it all up.

59:22.879 --> 59:25.839
Well, now, I might be inclined
to agree with you,

59:25.879 --> 59:30.360
were it not for the little matter
of Sunderland.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.720
Sixth form student, wasn't it?

59:35.639 --> 59:38.600
He was 18. We did nothing illegal.

59:38.639 --> 59:40.879
I made a stupid mistake.

59:42.800 --> 59:46.200
Laura told me everything,
that she moved here for a new start.

59:46.239 --> 59:49.000
That's as may be,
but you can see how this looks.

59:49.039 --> 59:50.319
Ma'am.

59:52.639 --> 59:55.119
Forensics got a match
from the crime scene.

59:55.159 --> 59:57.360
Fingerprints
in the upstairs bedroom.

59:57.400 --> 1:00:01.360
Adam Jannen, right? No, Ethan Dewley.
He'd been in the house.

1:00:03.759 --> 1:00:06.519
Well, how many more lads?

1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:15.720
I'll ask you again,

1:00:15.759 --> 1:00:20.519
were you having a relationship
with Ethan Dewley?

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:28.360
Ethan did a bit of work for me.

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:31.600
Gardening mostly.

1:00:35.519 --> 1:00:37.759
So you did know him.

1:00:40.839 --> 1:00:44.119
When did this gardening work start?

1:00:44.159 --> 1:00:48.200
A couple of months ago. I put up
a note in the cafe by the lake.

1:00:48.239 --> 1:00:51.639
He called, came over.
Mm-hm. Got friendly.

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:55.720
I'd only just moved in.
Ethan was missing his mum.

1:00:56.879 --> 1:00:59.280
You ever ask him into the house?

1:01:00.519 --> 1:01:03.879
Only we've got his fingerprints
in the bedroom.

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.159
Well, I've not idea
when he went up there.

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:10.439
So why lie to us about knowing him?
Hm?

1:01:11.439 --> 1:01:13.720
He'd been asking me
personal questions,

1:01:13.759 --> 1:01:17.720
spending too much time at the house.
It didn't feel right.

1:01:17.759 --> 1:01:21.280
So I told him the job wasn't working
out. How did he react to that?

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:24.800
Grabbed his things and left.

1:01:25.839 --> 1:01:28.280
I thought that would be
the last I saw of him.

1:01:28.319 --> 1:01:30.360
And was it?

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.839
He turned up on the doorstep
Thursday night.

1:01:32.879 --> 1:01:35.360
He needed somewhere to stay.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.079
Give him a bed for the night,
did you?

1:01:38.119 --> 1:01:40.280
No, I didn't.

1:01:41.639 --> 1:01:44.319
Jim made it clear
Ethan needed to leave.

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:48.200
Jim was there
when Ethan came calling?

1:01:48.239 --> 1:01:50.519
He went after Ethan to warn him off.

1:01:52.959 --> 1:01:55.079
He told me he sorted things.

1:02:07.839 --> 1:02:11.839
Were you procuring young lads
for Laura Halcombe?

1:02:11.879 --> 1:02:14.200
I am not even gonna answer
that question.

1:02:14.239 --> 1:02:16.439
Ooh, I think you better had,

1:02:16.479 --> 1:02:19.319
bearing in mind
what you've kept from us so far.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:22.159
I work with those kids
on a daily basis. Aye.

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:25.079
All the more reason for alarm bells
to be ringing.

1:02:25.119 --> 1:02:28.200
Now, we know you warned Ethan off

1:02:28.239 --> 1:02:31.119
last Thursday night
when he went over to Laura's.

1:02:31.159 --> 1:02:35.319
It was just a friendly chat. Slipped
your mind to mention it, did it?

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:38.159
I didn't want Laura
dragged into all this.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:41.319
Dragged into what? If people
found out about the school,

1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:43.959
she wouldn't have lasted
five minutes here.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.720
Did you know it was Ethan
who had broken in?

1:02:47.759 --> 1:02:51.439
I had suspicions. He wouldn't leave
her alone. He was always there.

1:02:51.479 --> 1:02:53.519
Pushing his luck?

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:56.920
For what it's worth,
Ethan Dewley gave me the creeps.

1:02:56.959 --> 1:03:00.759
Well, you'll be glad he's gone,
then, hm? Ohh.

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:04.280
Now, what were your movements
on Sunday evening

1:03:04.319 --> 1:03:09.280
before you went over to Laura's? I
was running round all over the park.

1:03:09.319 --> 1:03:12.400
Maintenance, repairs, at the lodges.
Bump into Ethan?

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:16.600
Thursday night
was the last time I saw him.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.639
Right, listen up.

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:24.839
Laura Halcombe and Jim Briscoe
are now persons of interest.

1:03:24.879 --> 1:03:27.639
We think they groomed these lads
in the chat room.

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:31.560
Both Adam and Ethan
were regular visitors to her house.

1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:35.879
One of them claims to be
in a relationship with her,
the other ends up murdered.

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:39.680
We've checked Laura computer,
nothing ties her to the chat room.

1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:41.920
We have Ethan's prints
in the bedroom.

1:03:41.959 --> 1:03:45.239
We don't even know if this break-in
happened. Why report it?

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:51.039
It puts him in the frame
for a murder. So let's just assume
she's telling the truth, hm?

1:03:51.079 --> 1:03:53.759
She's not in a relationship with Adam

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:56.720
and she hasn't seen Ethan
since Thursday

1:03:56.759 --> 1:03:59.680
and she didn't send those messages.
Someone did. Mm.

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:02.280
The night he went missing,

1:04:02.319 --> 1:04:05.879
he leaves Lowmere
after the fireworks,

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:09.280
and an hour or so later,
he's knocking on her door, right?

1:04:09.319 --> 1:04:13.920
So we know he's in the area
and he's in the vicinity of the lake.

1:04:13.959 --> 1:04:16.720
Now, Jac, the list of guests
at that hostel.

1:04:16.759 --> 1:04:21.720
We went through them all. But what
about the lodges around the lake?

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:24.800
Only one was vacant last weekend.

1:04:24.839 --> 1:04:27.680
Yeah, because it was under repair,
right?

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:31.879
What's the name of it?
Four Pines, South Shore.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.159
I'd say
that's a perfect place to hide.

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:59.479
The bed's been slept in.

1:05:06.039 --> 1:05:08.119
There's food.

1:05:10.439 --> 1:05:13.720
Well, someone set him up
with a Wi-Fi code,

1:05:13.759 --> 1:05:15.920
made him comfortable.

1:05:16.959 --> 1:05:19.720
And who might that have been, hm?

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:26.879
His dad was worried sick.
Ethan's dad didn't care about him.
No one did.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:29.879
I should arrest you
for obstructing a murder inquiry!

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:34.600
I told him Missing Persons
were searching. You didn't tell
the police where to find him.

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.920
It was like
he was enjoying the attention.

1:05:39.959 --> 1:05:42.400
You know, all this life,
he'd been a nobody.

1:05:42.439 --> 1:05:44.839
Suddenly everyone's
talking about him.

1:05:44.879 --> 1:05:50.280
I'm gonna ask you again,
when was the last time you saw Ethan?

1:05:53.879 --> 1:05:57.119
Sunday. I went round to the lodge.

1:05:58.159 --> 1:06:02.439
He was just lying there.
I could tell he was frightened.

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.680
I'd never seen him like that before.

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:07.959
What was he scared of?

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000
I think someone was out to get him.

1:06:10.039 --> 1:06:14.200
Who?
I don't know. He wouldn't say.

1:06:26.239 --> 1:06:30.200
We were right. Ethan had been hiding
in that empty lodge.

1:06:30.239 --> 1:06:35.119
Ma'am, those encrypted files
on Ethan's laptop,
they were pornographic photographs.

1:06:35.159 --> 1:06:40.200
A bit of a collection.
Anonymous lads. Maybe he was gay
and someone couldn't deal with it.

1:06:40.239 --> 1:06:44.680
Could be a reason for leaving home.
No. His dad said he wasn't into that.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:47.479
I got hold of Ethan's
chat room history, ma'am.

1:06:47.519 --> 1:06:49.959
He was following
the Missing thread online.

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.639
He was reading what people
were posting about him?

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:56.200
That'll be why he had internet access
where he was hiding.

1:07:02.639 --> 1:07:04.680
Kenny,

1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:07.759
those Art Teacher messages to Adam...

1:07:09.079 --> 1:07:11.720
..have you got the sender's
IP address?

1:07:11.759 --> 1:07:14.720
Well, they were sent
from different devices, ma'am.

1:07:14.759 --> 1:07:17.479
Some were used more than once.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.639
Is that one of them?

1:07:23.959 --> 1:07:26.800
Yes, ma'am.
Well, that's Ethan's laptop.

1:07:28.839 --> 1:07:31.039
He's not the victim here.

1:07:31.079 --> 1:07:33.239
He's the perpetrator!

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:38.439
He... is The Art Teacher.

1:07:39.479 --> 1:07:42.119
So, to be clear,

1:07:42.159 --> 1:07:45.639
Ethan Dewley posts a fake profile
on that chat room.

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:47.959
He's pretending to be Laura Halcombe.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.519
That's why he needed
to get to know the woman.

1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:53.400
Those personal questions,
the access to the house.

1:07:53.439 --> 1:07:56.839
All those intimate details
he's sending to this fella.

1:07:56.879 --> 1:07:59.000
That's why he steals the photograph.

1:07:59.039 --> 1:08:03.039
To prove to Adam that Art Teacher
is Laura. You've got it.

1:08:03.079 --> 1:08:07.479
Now, we know Ethan Dewley
is The Art Teacher.

1:08:07.519 --> 1:08:11.000
But no one out there knows
that we know,

1:08:11.039 --> 1:08:13.200
so can't we use that
to our advantage?

1:08:15.119 --> 1:08:18.720
Jac, can you make up
one of these profile names? Yeah.

1:08:18.759 --> 1:08:23.159
I didn't spend all those years
in Fraud for nothing.
Yeah, well, do that.

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:26.039
And then post something
on the Missing thread.

1:08:26.079 --> 1:08:28.519
See if anyone bites.

1:08:29.639 --> 1:08:35.319
Technically, that's entrapment,
ma'am. Yeah, well, let's not dwell
on technicalities, Kenny.

1:08:38.119 --> 1:08:41.400
Laura Halcombe has confirmed

1:08:41.439 --> 1:08:43.920
there was no relationship.

1:08:43.959 --> 1:08:46.639
She's lying.
We checked your phone for evidence.

1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:49.920
Well, you had no right.
And we can prove

1:08:49.959 --> 1:08:53.039
all these messages

1:08:53.079 --> 1:08:56.119
came from Ethan Dewley's laptop.

1:09:00.839 --> 1:09:03.239
No. No, you're making this up.

1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:05.680
He'd been stringing you along
for weeks.

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:08.720
Now, then, if that ever got out,

1:09:08.759 --> 1:09:11.319
how he'd been playing you,

1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:14.519
he'd be on borrowed time,
wouldn't he, eh?

1:09:16.119 --> 1:09:18.839
You need to talk to his parents.

1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:22.039
Please, you can't tell my dad.

1:09:23.039 --> 1:09:26.200
You can't tell my dad!
Should've thought of that earlier.

1:09:30.519 --> 1:09:32.959
He's got a cast-iron motive
for murder.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.839
Oh, I don't know.
You saw his reaction.

1:09:36.879 --> 1:09:39.200
He was as surprised as we were.

1:10:11.839 --> 1:10:14.119
Jac.
Oh. Cheers.

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:18.119
I've got you a fish supper.
Yeah, never mind that.

1:10:18.159 --> 1:10:20.360
Come and have a look
at these messages.

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.000
It's another chat room friend
of The Art Teacher.

1:10:26.039 --> 1:10:28.280
Who's Tommy?
I don't know.

1:10:28.319 --> 1:10:32.920
But whoever it is, they've been
flirting on this chat room for weeks.

1:10:32.959 --> 1:10:35.200
We need to find this Tommy

1:10:35.239 --> 1:10:38.039
and anyone else
that Ethan's been targeting.

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:47.519
Dewley!

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:51.479
Dewley!

1:10:53.159 --> 1:10:55.600
Get out here... now.

1:11:05.959 --> 1:11:07.759
Are you watching?

1:11:18.439 --> 1:11:20.639
This is for your pervert of a son.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.239
24 hours to pack your bags.

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.400
I'm coming for you next.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:04.400
He was witnessed by neighbours
smashing up the car.

1:12:04.439 --> 1:12:07.759
Sean Dewley declined to press
charges. We can press charges

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.360
for criminal damage and disturbing
the peace. Get statements.

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:14.519
Oh, making a point, were we?
He got what was coming to him.

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:19.200
The man's just lost his son.
That twisted little deviant's
no loss to anyone.

1:12:19.239 --> 1:12:21.280
Ah, get him out of my sight.

1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:30.239
We'll be releasing Adam from custody
this morning.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.759
Turns my stomach,
what he did to my boy.

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.039
Your son was a willing participant
when he thought he was in
with an older woman.

1:12:37.079 --> 1:12:39.600
I bet this is all down
to Si Whenchurch.

1:12:39.639 --> 1:12:41.920
The lad's a bad influence.

1:12:41.959 --> 1:12:43.879
Always has been.

1:12:44.879 --> 1:12:47.720
Well, you let me worry
about Simon Whenchurch.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:51.319
You wanna look
a little closer to home, love.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:57.519
Aiden.

1:12:58.759 --> 1:13:01.280
That new chat room intel,

1:13:01.319 --> 1:13:04.319
Tommy and The Art Teacher,
has anything come through?

1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:06.720
Tech team accessed
the private messages.

1:13:06.759 --> 1:13:09.479
A couple of months ago,
Art Teacher sends a photo,

1:13:09.519 --> 1:13:12.920
Tommy sends one back.
Is Tommy a solider?

1:13:12.959 --> 1:13:15.000
I've got a video link.

1:13:22.639 --> 1:13:24.839
We've been going after the wrong lad.

1:13:26.879 --> 1:13:30.879
Caught on film in his uniform
showing off his military equipment?

1:13:31.879 --> 1:13:35.000
Well, that's his chances at Sandhurst
gone up in smoke.

1:13:36.319 --> 1:13:37.879
Quick march!

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:41.600
Left! Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right!

1:13:44.159 --> 1:13:47.119
Parade... halt!

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:52.400
Police. Can you open the gates,
please? Ma'am.

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.319
Right turn!

1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:02.319
Shoulder arms!

1:14:09.159 --> 1:14:11.039
Good morning.

1:14:11.079 --> 1:14:16.360
Today's parade represents the end
of weeks of hard work, effort,

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:19.959
perseverance and commitment
from all of you.

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.239
I congratulate you
on making it this far.

1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:26.479
I need to talk to Cadet Whenchurch.
We're in the middle of a parade!

1:14:26.519 --> 1:14:28.400
I can't help that, love.

1:14:28.439 --> 1:14:30.560
Stand still!

1:14:34.639 --> 1:14:36.680
Simon!

1:14:44.879 --> 1:14:46.680
Simon.

1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:50.280
Simon.

1:14:58.039 --> 1:15:00.200
Where are you gonna run to?

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:03.400
(SIGHS) Come on.

1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:21.000
I'll check round the perimeter.

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.720
(CREAKING)

1:15:31.079 --> 1:15:33.319
(CREAKING)

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:52.879
Hello, pet.

1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:56.800
Sunday evening,

1:15:56.839 --> 1:15:59.639
you dropped Adam Jannen
at Pride Bank crossroads.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:03.319
I think you didn't drive him all
the way home because you'd argued.

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:10.439
He was... mouthing off
about Ethan snooping.

1:16:10.479 --> 1:16:13.000
So he did tell you he'd seen him.

1:16:15.839 --> 1:16:17.920
He wouldn't let it drop.

1:16:17.959 --> 1:16:20.039
I told him he could walk home.

1:16:20.079 --> 1:16:23.519
Now, you dropped him off,
you turned your car around

1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:25.759
and you drove back to the lake.

1:16:26.759 --> 1:16:29.879
Because you'd arranged
to meet Ethan there.

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:32.839
It wasn't Adam and those lasses
he'd been watching.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.879
It was you.

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.119
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Another post.

1:16:42.159 --> 1:16:43.560
Damselfly?

1:16:45.439 --> 1:16:47.519
I haven't seen this one before.

1:16:53.439 --> 1:16:56.479
Too much?
Not if it keeps them talking.

1:16:56.519 --> 1:16:58.839
Want to talk?

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.119
Agh! We need an urgent trace
on this IP address.

1:17:10.239 --> 1:17:12.680
I'd seen this woman
about the village.

1:17:14.159 --> 1:17:17.079
She was fit, you know? Older.

1:17:17.119 --> 1:17:20.400
She must have known
we were eyeing her up, though.

1:17:20.439 --> 1:17:23.479
A few days later,
I get this... this message

1:17:23.519 --> 1:17:26.839
in the chat room.
From The Art Teacher.

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:31.519
"Hey. How are you? Wanna talk?"

1:17:32.839 --> 1:17:36.119
Tells me she's new to the area.

1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:41.839
We kinda got friendly.
Well, that's one way of putting it.

1:17:42.879 --> 1:17:47.319
A few weeks later,
Adam drops this bomb. Tells me
they've got this thing going on.

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:50.680
Did Adam know
she'd been messaging you, as well?

1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:55.759
He's totally smitten. Too stupid to
realise she was stringing him along.

1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:58.280
Well, you weren't so clever yourself,
love.

1:17:58.319 --> 1:18:01.000
I messaged and told her
she was some kind of fake.

1:18:01.039 --> 1:18:04.159
That's when she started
with the threats. Blackmail?

1:18:05.959 --> 1:18:08.479
She told me she still had
this video I sent her.

1:18:08.519 --> 1:18:11.239
She threatened to post it online.
Oh, you stupid...

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:15.519
What I supposed to do?
I agreed to meet up with her.

1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:20.439
I didn't have a choice! And I get
there, the shelter by the lake,

1:18:20.479 --> 1:18:22.119
and it's Ethan.

1:18:22.159 --> 1:18:25.319
So what was it he wanted from you?

1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:29.039
At first, it was just money.
You should've come to the police.

1:18:29.079 --> 1:18:32.800
And what would I have said? I mean,
I thought things were sorted.

1:18:32.839 --> 1:18:37.119
I'd paid him off, bought him that...
that stupid bike.

1:18:37.159 --> 1:18:41.239
So what happened this weekend?
I get to the lake and he's all...

1:18:42.319 --> 1:18:44.879
..he's all fired up.

1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:48.519
He said we needed to atone for
what we'd done to him and I just...

1:18:50.839 --> 1:18:52.920
I just lost it.

1:18:52.959 --> 1:18:56.000
(SIGHS)
And did you take a pop at him?

1:18:56.039 --> 1:18:59.639
H-H-He just fell. Right?
He hit his head.

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:03.839
I didn't...
I didn't mean to kill him.

1:19:03.879 --> 1:19:07.280
You removed his clothes,
you folded them up,

1:19:07.319 --> 1:19:09.959
to make it look like
it was an accident.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.920
If he'd posted that video,
he could've ruined my life.

1:19:13.959 --> 1:19:16.159
You did that all by yourself, Simon.

1:19:19.439 --> 1:19:21.239
Come on, son.

1:19:23.879 --> 1:19:25.600
(SIGHS)

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:28.200
(PHONE RINGS)

1:19:28.239 --> 1:19:32.239
Mark. "Ma'am, another chat room
user's made contact."

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:35.920
We think maybe they know something.
Well, go on, I'm listening.

1:19:35.959 --> 1:19:39.400
The message was sent from
Lowmere Hostel, an internet cafe.

1:19:39.439 --> 1:19:41.839
"Profile name Damselfly."

1:19:41.879 --> 1:19:43.560
Damselfly?

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:47.119
You've no right to question him.
Not without a lawyer. Hang on.

1:19:47.159 --> 1:19:52.159
Mr Whenchurch,
does your daughter have a tattoo
of a damselfly on her arm?

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:55.439
Yeah. Why?
And where is she at the moment?

1:19:55.479 --> 1:19:57.759
I've no idea.
How was she this morning?

1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:00.800
It was Simon's big day. I...
You didn't really notice.

1:20:00.839 --> 1:20:04.600
If she gets in touch with you,
you call us immediately.

1:20:04.639 --> 1:20:07.360
There's nothing wrong, is there?
Is there?

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:11.200
They were in this together.
Mark, get Jac over to that hostel.

1:20:11.239 --> 1:20:13.600
We're looking for Alice Whenchurch.

1:20:27.239 --> 1:20:29.879
Any sign? No one's seen her
since this morning.

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:32.280
Her bike's gone.
She must know we're onto her.

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:38.239
Darkwater.
She's headed up to Darkwater.

1:21:08.319 --> 1:21:10.720
Anything?
No sign, ma'am.

1:21:10.759 --> 1:21:13.479
It's pretty boggy.
I think we'll have to walk.

1:21:19.439 --> 1:21:21.439
She's here somewhere.

1:21:21.479 --> 1:21:23.280
Here you go.

1:21:24.959 --> 1:21:27.360
See if you can keep her talking.

1:21:35.639 --> 1:21:37.479
What's that?

1:21:43.079 --> 1:21:45.439
There she is.

1:21:47.159 --> 1:21:49.639
Stay away from me!

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:52.119
If she climbs up,
there's nowhere left to run.

1:21:52.159 --> 1:21:56.560
Well, we better get up there
after her, before she does
something stupid.

1:21:56.600 --> 1:22:00.519
Aiden, with me.
Be sure you keep your distance.

1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:02.680
You two, wait for backup.

1:22:14.319 --> 1:22:16.159
(WHIMPERS)

1:22:22.319 --> 1:22:25.600
I'll jump. I'll throw myself off!

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:30.079
You don't wanna do that, pet.

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:35.439
Oh, is it OK if I just sit here,
get my breath back?

1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:38.759
(SIGHS)

1:22:42.519 --> 1:22:45.519
This where you used to sit
with Ethan, is it?

1:22:49.479 --> 1:22:52.560
Ethan said it felt like
the top of the world.

1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:54.839
Yeah, it does a bit.

1:22:58.159 --> 1:23:00.959
Is this where the pair of you
came up with your plan

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.800
to get back at those bullies?

1:23:03.839 --> 1:23:06.479
It was just a game at first.

1:23:06.519 --> 1:23:09.039
And then Adam took the bait.

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:13.720
He really thought
that Laura was into him!

1:23:17.119 --> 1:23:20.479
Did you know that he was messaging
your brother, as well?

1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:25.039
No.

1:23:25.079 --> 1:23:27.600
It was Si who told me.

1:23:27.639 --> 1:23:30.039
Ah.
That's why you fell out with Ethan.

1:23:30.079 --> 1:23:32.680
Si wanted me to talk to Ethan.

1:23:33.839 --> 1:23:36.360
Make him see sense.

1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:42.479
So I went to the lake with him.

1:23:43.839 --> 1:23:45.759
OK. Right.

1:23:47.879 --> 1:23:52.479
Ethan was just stood there...
laughing at me.

1:23:52.519 --> 1:23:55.039
He said I was just like the others.

1:23:56.119 --> 1:23:58.319
A spoilt little girl.

1:24:00.959 --> 1:24:02.959
So what happened, love?

1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.720
He was waving his phone, said he was
gonna post what was on it.

1:24:06.759 --> 1:24:09.159
I couldn't let him do that
to my brother.

1:24:13.639 --> 1:24:15.720
So I tried to grab it.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.119
And he was...

1:24:20.159 --> 1:24:22.879
pulling and...
and twisting my wrist.

1:24:26.439 --> 1:24:28.560
I must have pushed him.

1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:33.800
And he slipped.

1:24:40.479 --> 1:24:42.600
His eyes were still open.

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.800
But I could see he was dead.

1:24:46.839 --> 1:24:49.959
(SOBS) Si told me to go home.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.600
He said he'd make things right.

1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:56.839
He was trying to protect me.

1:24:57.959 --> 1:25:00.159
And it was all my fault!

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:02.239
(SOBS)

1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:05.839
Stay away! I'm warning you!

1:25:05.879 --> 1:25:09.239
Hey, go back!
He's not gonna come near, love.

1:25:13.079 --> 1:25:15.000
He's gone.

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:20.759
Look, you don't want to do this,
Alice.

1:25:23.159 --> 1:25:25.639
I mean, who's it going to help, eh?

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:29.959
Certainly not your brother
or your dad.

1:25:32.959 --> 1:25:36.280
And look at Ethan's poor dad, eh?
The state he's in.

1:25:36.319 --> 1:25:38.360
You wouldn't wish that on anyone.

1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:41.879
Come on, love.

1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:44.639
Can't we finish this
somewhere warm, eh?

1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:47.079
Can we?

1:25:47.119 --> 1:25:49.879
I can't... I can't move.

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:55.079
That's all right,
I'll come and get you.

1:25:55.119 --> 1:25:57.079
Don't you worry.

1:25:57.119 --> 1:25:59.039
I don't wanna fall!

1:25:59.079 --> 1:26:02.479
I'm not gonna let you fall, love.

1:26:02.519 --> 1:26:04.360
Now, don't look down.

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:08.319
Here I come. I'm nearly there.

1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:10.639
Don't look down, love.

1:26:13.519 --> 1:26:16.239
Now, what I want you to do...

1:26:17.759 --> 1:26:21.159
..is just raise your right arm.

1:26:27.159 --> 1:26:31.280
Ohh. That's it. (SOBS)
There. I've got you, love.

1:26:31.319 --> 1:26:34.519
Come on, pet. I've got you.
(SOBS)

1:26:54.759 --> 1:26:59.079
Just came to tell you we've charged
Alice Whenchurch with Ethan's murder.

1:27:00.959 --> 1:27:03.239
I heard you'd picked up her brother.

1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:06.759
We've charged him with being
an accessory after the fact.

1:27:08.039 --> 1:27:09.839
Right.

1:27:09.879 --> 1:27:13.639
Losing Ethan was hard enough,
but do you know what's worse?

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:15.839
The shame of what he did.

1:27:16.839 --> 1:27:19.800
Your lad was provoked.
He made a mistake.

1:27:19.839 --> 1:27:21.959
And he paid a heavy price for that.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.639
Yeah.

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.000
I'm finished in this village.

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:31.519
Or you could stay.

1:27:33.759 --> 1:27:37.879
Face them all down.
Stand up for Ethan.

1:27:39.959 --> 1:27:42.479
(ENGINE STARTS)

1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:10.000
I remember when this was all fields
and villages.

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.680
Changes a place,
something like this happening.

1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:17.839
Scars it somehow.

1:28:19.079 --> 1:28:22.360
You know you were out of order,
doing what you did up there.

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:26.200
I knew you had my back.
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

1:28:30.159 --> 1:28:31.959
Sorry.

1:28:33.639 --> 1:28:38.360
Oh, didn't I ever tell you?
I was once offered a job
in police mountain rescue.

1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:42.639
Was you?
Oh, aye. Like a mountain goat, I was.
