00:22.280 --> 00:22.990
Hey!

00:24.040 --> 00:25.870
What do you do when you run out of pans?

00:25.920 --> 00:29.600
I have no idea. I mean, it's
never actually rained before.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.990
- Where you going?
- If we're gonna build an ark

00:34.040 --> 00:36.630
I need to get started. And
you, you need to find what?

00:36.680 --> 00:39.630
Two of each kind of animal.
Meet me back here in 20 minutes.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.470
Er... No. That's impossible.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.920
All right. Well, 30,
and no more. Emergency.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.670
- It's stopped.
- Thank you, Captain Obvious.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.430
Ha-ha!

01:00.480 --> 01:02.190
I have to go to work.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.629
You better get building,
there's a monsoon coming.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.990
Wait.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.510
- What?
- You know...

01:09.560 --> 01:12.750
you know how you're always
right about everything?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.190
Keep talking.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.040
You were right about us.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.880
About all this...

01:21.960 --> 01:23.670
This is what we need.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.950
We never had... had time
for each other before.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.950
- Which was my fault.
- No, no.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.390
We weren't broken.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.200
We were just stuck... in
a rut. But both of us.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.500
And you had the balls to up and leave.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.870
I seem to remember you dumping me.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.510
- Because I'm an idiot.
- Yes.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.350
And I thought you might back down.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.990
- Not disappear to India.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.750
No! I get it.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.550
It is amazing here.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.600
Let's take off. Let's hit the road.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.680
- And go where?
- Well, I don't know.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.280
- Let's get lost together.
- And then?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.400
Who knows?

02:09.440 --> 02:11.520
But let's see.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.040
I have to go.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.390
- Will you think about it?
- I'll think about it.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.550
Seriously?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.600
I'll think about it.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.600
- You can drop me here.
- Oh.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.320
I can take you to the front
door. It's no trouble.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.800
Lydia.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.440
Tell me again why we
aren't doing this for real?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.560
I've got work to do.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.900
What time do you call this?

03:44.080 --> 03:47.150
Oh, for God's sake! You
want to give me heart attack?

03:47.200 --> 03:50.110
There's no inheritance if
that's what you're thinking.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.630
You didn't come home last
night. I was worried.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.760
Where I go at night is my own business.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.710
Ms Pradeep... is very nice company.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.670
A most stimulating woman.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.430
What if she is just after your money?

04:09.480 --> 04:12.670
Ah! So it is about the inheritance!

04:12.720 --> 04:14.830
Come on, look all around you.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.200
Is this what you call Mumbai luxury?

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
There you are.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.800
At my age one never knows
when the rain will come.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.600
And by rain, I mean death.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.350
OK. Order of service.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.470
Dr Varma -- minor ops list.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.990
Dr Nair has his follow-up clinic.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.910
Dr Walker will deal with casualty.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.430
Any questions?

04:44.480 --> 04:47.190
Then let's get on with it.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.240
Dr Walker? A moment of your time, please?

04:53.280 --> 04:56.560
I called about our nun.
She's recovering very well.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.320
I'm glad. She was lucky.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.070
- Is that all?
- Not quite.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.870
I understand you have a
guest staying with you?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.350
A friend from England.
He arrived unexpectedly.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.750
Oh, I see.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.310
Hospital accommodation is for staff only,

05:16.360 --> 05:19.150
Dr Walker.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.400
I was considering taking some leave.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.110
OK, yeah. A day or two is fine.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.550
Just make sure your clinics are covered.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.150
Actually, we were planning
on a couple of weeks.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.950
- Maybe more.
- You have a job here.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.790
A potential career.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.590
I'd advise against wasting your time

05:36.640 --> 05:38.350
with a rucksack and a guidebook.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.830
No matter who asks you.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.280
I think that's for me
to decide, don't you?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.550
Fine, Dr Walker. If you wish
to leave, just leave. Today.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.270
I need committed doctors, not dilettantes.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.360
Like I told you, my patients
are not dinner party stories.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.400
Sorry!

06:17.920 --> 06:20.390
- Going somewhere?
- Home.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.640
How's Maggie?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.070
Not good.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.910
I mean...

06:27.960 --> 06:30.480
I didn't think it was gonna be this quick.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.350
Sorry.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.640
Hey, don't be daft.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.280
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.880
Don't... don't wish it away, eh?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
Whatever you've got.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.590
I just came to say,
thanks, you know, for...

06:53.640 --> 06:56.480
Well, for everything. It helped.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.630
I served cold beer and bad cocktails.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.390
Exactly!

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
Look after yourself.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.550
Unbelievable! How many is that now?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.310
Good doctors who left us

07:27.360 --> 07:29.510
because they couldn't
stand your craziness!

07:29.560 --> 07:31.750
- I'll tell you. Six. Six!
- You're exaggerating.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.510
Shall I name them?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.550
When we find the right people,
they stay. Dr Varma, for example.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.750
Dr Varma! I don't know what's
going on inside his head.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.590
I admit he's a great physician,

07:41.640 --> 07:44.910
but self-imposed exile is
not a retention strategy!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.710
We need Dr Walker. Better apologise.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.390
No! If she wants to leave, best do it now.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.150
Why waste energy on someone
with no intention of staying?

07:53.200 --> 07:56.350
Lydia, I'm asking her to reconsider.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.750
Dr Walker is an excellent clinician

07:58.800 --> 08:02.200
and you better damn well hope
I can make her change her mind.

08:07.660 --> 08:10.610
Aargh-argh! Aargh-aargh-aargh.

08:10.660 --> 08:14.170
This happens every year. Argh!

08:14.220 --> 08:17.780
My joints seize as if
they're filled with rust.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.450
And it rains. Better than a weatherman.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.930
Well, you certainly have
some arthritis there.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.290
I can prescribe
anti-inflammatory medication.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.940
No need. No need, Doctor. I
just need my usual injection.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.650
Which is?

08:32.700 --> 08:35.140
Which is, what Dr Fonseca used to give me.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.090
Today I am an old man,

08:38.140 --> 08:40.490
the next I can skip to Mumbai and back.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.250
Sometimes steroids can help,

08:42.299 --> 08:44.890
but there's nothing in your
record about an injection.

08:44.940 --> 08:46.650
Dr Fonseca will know.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.820
Just tell her Hitesh is
here with both his knees.

08:51.180 --> 08:53.050
Dr Walker. A moment?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.490
Hello, sir. Hey, why don't you ask him?

08:55.540 --> 08:57.570
Just one second.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.490
You know Lydia.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.450
She's impulsive. She reacts.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.490
But at heart she's a good person.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.770
But she sends you to apologise for her?

09:06.820 --> 09:09.370
I'm here because I want

09:09.420 --> 09:11.460
what is the best for this hospital.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.700
Despite appearances I'm
still officially in charge.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.970
My friend, the one who's visiting me...

09:21.020 --> 09:23.810
That shouldn't be a
problem, whatever Lydia says.

09:23.860 --> 09:27.170
- Exceptions can always be made.
- No, er... No, it's erm...

09:27.220 --> 09:28.930
It's not that.

09:28.980 --> 09:32.770
He's the reason why I came
out here in the first place.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.210
Not the whole reason.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.650
We broke up.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.800
Neither interesting nor original.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.530
And now he is here.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.290
Yeah.

09:45.340 --> 09:49.420
Where the heart leads...
the mind can but follow.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.300
I hope you find what you're looking for.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.460
Thank you.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.570
Dr Nair?

10:09.620 --> 10:11.330
My erm... my patient -- Hitesh.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.690
He says he always gets an
injection for his knees?

10:13.740 --> 10:15.530
But I can't find anything in the notes.

10:15.580 --> 10:17.370
Salt water. Normal saline.

10:17.420 --> 10:20.690
She gives it to him every year.
5 mils in the right buttock.

10:20.740 --> 10:22.650
But make sure you hurt him a little.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.490
You know, when you're giving a placebo

10:24.540 --> 10:27.060
a little bit of pain goes a long way.

10:50.820 --> 10:51.820
Christ.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.010
- Hiya.
- What are you doing here?

10:58.060 --> 11:00.090
Thought I'd come and
have a look for myself.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.130
This is just mad.

11:02.180 --> 11:05.300
It kind of makes sense.
Once you get used to it.

11:06.940 --> 11:10.890
Hey. This is Gabriel.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.810
Dr Varma. We've been working together.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.610
Hi. Marcus.

11:14.660 --> 11:18.260
Marcus is a friend of mine. From England.

11:20.980 --> 11:24.050
Of course. It's nice to meet you.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.850
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Excuse me.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.130
Er... Dr Varma. There's
someone to see you.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.500
About Mrs Smart? She's quite insistent.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.380
Excuse me.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.210
- Don't think he likes me.
- I'm not sure he likes anyone.

11:41.260 --> 11:44.340
Maybe he just fancies you. I would.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.260
Come on.

11:50.260 --> 11:53.260
Actually, I'm... I'm glad you're here.

11:56.660 --> 12:00.450
I've thought about it. What you said.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.220
OK.

12:05.060 --> 12:07.650
And?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.490
And I wanna do it.

12:09.540 --> 12:11.730
Leave this place. And then see India.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.980
- With you.
- Seriously?

12:17.260 --> 12:18.970
Yeah.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.500
It's OK.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.850
I am afraid your mother's
condition has deteriorated

12:41.900 --> 12:44.300
quite significantly in the last few days.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.460
I see.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.340
Ah...

12:56.940 --> 12:59.530
And Mrs Kamal is due
her blood test tomorrow.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.330
- That's it.
- Don't worry.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.380
I can take care of it.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.730
He's very handsome. Hm?

13:08.780 --> 13:09.490
I think so.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.060
Hey, I'm gonna miss you.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.240
They are fools to let you go. All of them.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.690
No! Not there.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.210
Outpatients! Come!

13:25.260 --> 13:27.260
Come with me.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.930
- You OK?
- Yeah. Let's do this.

13:43.980 --> 13:45.980
Good.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.610
Right, everything's been arranged.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.890
The emergency evacuation
team are on their way.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.650
They'll be here in a couple of hours.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.170
All you need to do is to care
for her until they arrive.

14:12.220 --> 14:15.120
- Dr Varma has done everything...
- Dad! - .. possible.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.530
I'm sure Dr Varma's doing his
best given the circumstances.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.090
That's it. Is everything clear?

14:22.140 --> 14:25.170
No. It's always been my understanding

14:25.220 --> 14:27.210
that your mother wanted to stay here.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.130
My mother might want to dance
to quickstep with Fred Astaire,

14:30.180 --> 14:32.250
but what she needs is expert medical help.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.530
Now, look, I don't blame you.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.410
Or this hospital for what's happened.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.560
She's been hiding it from all
of us for such a long time.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.970
I've been fully aware
of Maggie's diagnosis.

14:45.020 --> 14:46.770
She told me at the wedding reception.

14:46.820 --> 14:51.570
Excuse me?

14:51.620 --> 14:54.020
You're telling me that
you knew about this?

14:55.460 --> 14:57.220
Dad?

15:02.820 --> 15:07.210
Yes, immediately. I'm
short-staffed as it is.

15:07.260 --> 15:10.410
Fine, fine. Just let me know the
minute someone becomes available.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.330
Is it you who's in charge here?

15:12.380 --> 15:14.380
Apparently.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.260
Perhaps you can explain to me
exactly what's been going on.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.530
So, um... where exactly are we going?

16:23.580 --> 16:25.300
Er... that way.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.120
At least you've got a plan.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.810
Doctor!

16:33.860 --> 16:36.020
Dr Ruby!

16:45.020 --> 16:47.890
- Is that a friend of yours?
- Vijay.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.860
He's one of my patients.
We go back a long way.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.610
~

16:54.660 --> 16:57.330
Erm... You're joking,
we'll get the next one.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.380
We're on holiday, remember?

17:03.860 --> 17:05.569
I should have been told.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.690
My patient has a right to confidentiality.

17:07.740 --> 17:09.930
- Your patient is my mother.
- OK, OK.

17:09.980 --> 17:13.089
I have only recently been
made aware of this situation.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.329
Then maybe you need to
supervise your staff.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.369
And while the circumstances are unusual,

17:17.420 --> 17:20.530
it's clear your mother expressed
a wish to remain here.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.530
Now, if that has changed, Dr Varma,

17:22.579 --> 17:24.490
then we must respect that choice too.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.410
She's too sick to make this choice.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.210
But her previous wishes were
to remain here to the end.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.130
It's my mother lying
there. She's critically ill.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.890
She needs help.

17:33.940 --> 17:35.730
And she has it.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.370
In a real hospital.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.130
Not some place in the back of beyond,

17:40.180 --> 17:42.770
being treated by a doctor who
clearly has a God complex!

17:42.820 --> 17:46.210
Mrs Smart has a severe chest infection.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.410
She is not fit to be
transferred, let alone to fly.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.560
I think I should be the judge of that.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.650
Take a deep breath for me, if you can.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.700
Deep breath, love.

18:00.860 --> 18:01.860
Thank you.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.980
I don't think it'll be long now.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.420
I know.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.690
Do you want to go home?

18:28.740 --> 18:30.460
Please.

18:31.620 --> 18:33.620
Just where is that these days?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.210
Tell me.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.900
How long have you lived here?

18:42.340 --> 18:44.340
Long enough to know where I belong.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.540
Snap.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.130
Maggie has pneumonia. Her
oxygen levels are low.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.460
So a flight now would
be extremely dangerous.

19:02.460 --> 19:04.180
But not impossible?

19:05.540 --> 19:07.420
Your mother is dying, Debbie.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.810
As doctors, we can help her
do it with grace and dignity

19:11.860 --> 19:14.210
or we can make her suffer
right through to the end.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.770
I know which I would prefer.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.340
Well, it's not your decision.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.170
We're her family. It's down to us.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.210
I'm afraid you're wrong.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.970
My duty is to act in my
patient's best interests.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.130
So I'm sorry, but I won't release her.

19:29.180 --> 19:30.900
Not like this.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.090
She's made her wishes perfectly clear.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.890
And yet her daughter
informs me that Mrs Smart

19:40.940 --> 19:43.010
has already agreed to medical evacuation?

19:43.060 --> 19:46.690
And these things are possible
with proper critical care.

19:46.740 --> 19:48.730
But brutal and undignified.

19:48.780 --> 19:52.850
Exactly! We have a duty
to her, not to her family.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.890
And I have a duty to the hospital.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.890
We can't afford lawyers.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.290
Each complaint costs
us money we don't have.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.050
I've already made my decision.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.010
And I'm going to overrule it, for once.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.770
She goes back to England.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.020
I'll sign the form myself, if necessary.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.420
What's up?

20:55.780 --> 20:57.490
Christ.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.420
She's a doctor from the Good Karma.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.580
Stop! Enough!

21:11.700 --> 21:13.690
- Has anyone called for help?
- Yes, yes.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.970
Good. I need to see
everyone who's injured.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.610
One at a time. Everyone will be helped.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.660
OK? Good.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.380
Yes?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.410
There's been a crash.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.210
The bus to Kochi is on its side.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.730
There are at least three
other vehicles involved.

21:37.780 --> 21:40.010
Multiple casualties.
The bulk will come here.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.690
Get theatre ready. Make
sure resus is fully equipped.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.010
Then we need casualty cleared completely.

21:45.060 --> 21:47.810
The same goes for the wards.
Anyone who can leaves now.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.850
Dr Varma will lead the field team.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.620
~

21:53.220 --> 21:55.410
Dr Fonseca, I thought you should know.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.210
I spoke to Dr Walker before she left.

21:57.260 --> 21:58.970
Ruby was heading to Kochi.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.020
- Have we heard from her?
- No.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.370
Dr Varma?

22:04.420 --> 22:06.730
Whatever the situation,
strict triage applies.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.980
The sickest come first, no exceptions.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.370
Can you tell me where it hurts?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.700
- ~
- I need your scarf.

22:17.780 --> 22:20.490
This is only gonna hurt for a second, OK?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.290
- Argh!
- Ruby?

22:22.340 --> 22:25.500
I need something to use as a
splint and to secure it with.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.770
I need some traction.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.180
Come on.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.020
It's all right, I've got it. Go on.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.020
Hey. Here.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.780
- Where's Vijay?
- I don't know.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.890
He was with me. Vijay!

22:46.940 --> 22:50.730
I'm gonna find him, all
right? Just stay here, OK?

22:50.780 --> 22:52.780
Vijay?

23:01.740 --> 23:03.450
Vijay?

23:03.500 --> 23:05.220
Hey, Vijay?

23:11.180 --> 23:11.880
Vijay?

23:16.020 --> 23:17.380
Oh, God.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.360
Vijay, no. No, no, no.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.300
~

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
~

23:30.480 --> 23:32.200
Vijay?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.350
Mummy!

23:38.400 --> 23:40.120
Cover him up.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.680
You OK?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
Yeah. Yeah. Go, go.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.910
- How many on the bus?
- I don't know, too many.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.670
Dr Walker?

23:56.720 --> 23:58.990
Ruby?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.200
Yeah, she's fine. In the bus.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.480
~

24:09.720 --> 24:11.430
He's trapped. It's serious.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.750
Tachycardia, likely severe chest injury.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.390
Possible abdominal trauma.
Give me your stethoscope.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.160
OK.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.150
Come on, Vijay.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.990
- Well?
- No air on the left.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.830
- Blood or a tension.
- Decompress it.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.870
- Field thoracotomy.
- Here?

24:30.920 --> 24:33.630
If it's a haemothorax,
he'll bleed out and die.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.440
If it's a tension, he'll
arrest. We have no choice.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.160
Deeper. Sweep with a finger.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.960
Make sure it stays open.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.590
- Aargh!
- He's trapped.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.950
We need to get him to
hospital -- it's critical.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.800
Vijay! Vijay!

25:05.520 --> 25:08.270
The theatre's ready. Anything?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.670
Not yet.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.430
What now?

25:12.480 --> 25:14.200
We wait.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.710
OK, pull him when I tell you, right?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.480
Yeah.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.100
Pull. Try now.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.880
No, no good.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.000
Right, now.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.110
Go on. Don't stop. Keep pulling.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.870
Come on.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.440
OK. OK, I've got him.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.040
OK. OK.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.110
Vijay Kholi, seven years old.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.430
Roll over RTC with chest
and abdominal trauma.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.950
Left sided thoracotomy for
a tension pneumothorax.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.990
Unstable, likely internal haemorrhage.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.150
- Let's get him to theatre.
- I can assist.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.200
Not like this. He needs
steady hands and cool heads.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.760
There are patients on the way
who need your help, Dr Walker.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.440
How's he doing?

26:48.760 --> 26:50.630
Stable enough.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.950
A splenic injury. A moment's
delay and he would have died.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.030
I agree. Too far gone.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.880
Total splenectomy.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.270
I heard she pulled him out of the wreck.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.720
You're going to tell
me to apologise to her.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.280
They say it is the hardest word.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.440
But then you always did love a challenge.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.190
They need the bed, Dad.
Come on, it's time to go.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.240
Flight's at 8:30pm.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.430
All we have to do is check in separately

27:20.480 --> 27:23.600
and then we just board the
flight a few minutes earlier.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.280
No.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.990
What?

27:29.040 --> 27:30.750
No. She's not going.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.350
Come on, Dad, don't be
ridiculous. It's all arranged.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.110
- We're going home. - Yes, that's what
I'm talking about, taking my mum home.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.270
No, it's here. She wants to stay here.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.230
It's what she wanted from the start.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.270
If we can get Mum back to
England, they can help her!

27:44.320 --> 27:46.640
- I spoke to the specialist.
- No!

27:47.400 --> 27:49.880
That's it, is it? Just no?

27:51.640 --> 27:53.870
You bugger off to the
other side of the world

27:53.920 --> 27:57.000
and I get a phone call,
a bloody phone call, Dad!

27:57.440 --> 27:59.950
Saying, "Hello, how are
you? The weather's nice.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.080
People are friendly. Your mum's
got an incurable brain tumour!"

28:04.680 --> 28:06.750
Because she knew what would happen.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.750
That the world and his wife would descend

28:08.800 --> 28:10.670
and there'd be more doctors and tests

28:10.720 --> 28:13.320
and yet more tests for
God knows what reason.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.440
Because she knew she was
dying and she wanted to live.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.310
Even if it was just for a month or two.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.350
She just wanted to live.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.150
So you decided it was
better to just shut me out?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.910
Best she doesn't know?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.670
You spring it on all of us

28:28.720 --> 28:30.910
and I'm just supposed to
be all right with that?

28:30.960 --> 28:33.790
That wasn't my idea. That
was your mother's choice.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.830
Oh.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.120
- She loves you, but...
- But what, Dad?

28:39.640 --> 28:42.440
I mean... I'm her daughter.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.040
There isn't supposed to be a "but".

28:47.120 --> 28:48.960
She just didn't want this.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.120
Or me.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.800
No.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.720
Wait!

29:14.120 --> 29:16.720
- When will they tell me?
- As soon as they know.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.830
He's in good hands, I promise.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.880
Now sit still.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.150
As I suspected, it's
fractured in two places.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.680
But we can fix it. I'll arrange
a transfer as soon as possible.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.480
Excuse me. Dr Fonseca?

29:34.400 --> 29:37.190
Ruptured spleen, rib
fractures, lung contusion.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.350
All treatable. He should do very well.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.310
Thank you.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.360
It's us who should be thanking you.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.550
- How are the others doing?
- Fine. Under control.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.600
I'd expect nothing less.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.270
Well?

29:53.320 --> 29:55.360
- Well, what?
- I thought you were going?

29:57.360 --> 29:59.080
Oh.

30:00.080 --> 30:04.150
I can't imagine anyone wanting
to walk away from all this.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.270
Not if they love it like I do.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.440
Not if you feel it here.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.990
Why don't you ask him to
stay -- on your terms?

30:14.040 --> 30:16.240
See what he says, then come and find me.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.360
They've gone.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.230
He's taken her to the beach.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.480
I just came back to get this.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.200
Do you want me to take you there?

30:41.240 --> 30:43.390
They've made their decision.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.150
My flight leaves in an hour.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.200
Wait, please.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.990
Don't leave.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.790
Not like this.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.950
I tried to do what I thought was right.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.280
Clearly, it wasn't. I
know when I'm not wanted.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.840
I think you're making a mistake.
Your mother loves it here.

31:02.760 --> 31:06.880
And a good life deserves a good death.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.520
That's all she wants.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.960
And I just... I tried to help her.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.000
I've never really seen you work.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.960
Even after all these years together, I...

31:47.880 --> 31:49.760
.. I never really got it.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.480
Snap.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.480
We make one hell of a team.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.120
Don't we?

32:01.040 --> 32:02.750
I...

32:02.800 --> 32:04.560
I don't want to leave this.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.830
Being a doctor.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.240
Real people, a real job...

32:12.920 --> 32:14.960
I was right all along.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.990
This is all I ever wanted.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.040
Sure.

32:21.160 --> 32:25.950
It's great experience. I mean,
it's six months, a year.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.240
That's not what I'm talking about.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.120
I don't want to go home.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.080
Not now.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.680
Maybe not ever.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.520
OK.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.230
But we could stay.

32:43.280 --> 32:46.030
Both of us.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.800
In India?

32:51.560 --> 32:53.270
I love you.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.430
Then stay. Here.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.160
With me. This could be our life.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.520
It's not that easy.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.190
But it should be.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.150
Don't you see?

33:08.200 --> 33:11.040
If it isn't, then what the
hell are we both doing?

33:28.680 --> 33:30.400
Hello.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.550
Are you alone?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.360
Putting the kettle on.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.230
Ah.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.920
I never did get to see my turtle.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.720
You know they come back here every year?

33:51.080 --> 33:53.390
Lay their eggs on this beach.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.470
Nowhere else will do.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.560
I've seen them.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.550
Stubborn little buggers, they are.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.040
When they decide the time is right...

34:10.360 --> 34:13.520
.. there's nothing on Earth
will change their mind.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.480
Thank you, Dr Varma.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.920
Thank you for everything you've done.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.600
Please... just call me Gabriel.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.719
Goodbye, Gabriel.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.400
Namaste, Maggie.

35:01.240 --> 35:05.400
Namaste... Gabriel.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.000
Look.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.200
And another.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.120
They're home.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.920
They're all going home.

37:35.540 --> 37:37.260
Well?

37:38.260 --> 37:40.260
You were right.

37:41.980 --> 37:44.010
I'm sorry.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.980
Are you?

37:46.980 --> 37:51.130
"A man you don't love's like a
sticking plaster you don't need.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.900
Just rip it off."

37:55.580 --> 37:59.500
Thing is... I did love him.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.980
Past tense?

38:03.940 --> 38:06.050
I don't think it's that simple.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.940
These things rarely are.

38:12.580 --> 38:15.620
You were right about that girl. The nun.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.890
I was wrong.

38:19.940 --> 38:24.020
If she'd died, I'd never
have forgiven myself.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.970
I am sorry.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.020
Thank you.

38:32.420 --> 38:34.340
You're a good doctor, Ruby.

38:36.220 --> 38:39.330
I can make you into an excellent one.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.460
If that's what you want.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.980
- You called me Ruby.
- A moment of weakness.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.740
Well?

38:52.380 --> 38:54.460
I think it is.

39:24.460 --> 39:27.090
- Ladies?
- Pina Colada?

39:27.140 --> 39:29.130
- You're learning.
- Two, please.

39:29.180 --> 39:31.460
Your wish is my command.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.810
- Today was a nasty one.
- Cheers.

39:43.860 --> 39:46.140
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.740
One can never say when
the rains will come.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.220
You do understand that, don't you?

39:55.140 --> 39:57.260
Come join us.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.330
Don't make me insist.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.860
Come.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.260
Hi.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.850
- Hi.
- Oh.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.490
Sorry, but that is disgusting.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.970
You see, the clue is
in this little umbrella.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.820
Beer, please.

40:36.940 --> 40:40.980
So, is your... Is your
friend er... joining us?

40:42.460 --> 40:44.410
He's going home.

40:44.460 --> 40:46.500
Ah.

40:54.260 --> 40:56.020
And you?

40:57.940 --> 41:00.060
I think I'm already there.

41:19.940 --> 41:23.490
- Can I ask you something?
- You just did.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.250
Why do you stay with me?

41:25.300 --> 41:28.690
I mean, there must be loads
of available women out there

41:28.740 --> 41:31.130
for a handsome devil like you, so why me?

41:31.180 --> 41:34.010
- No comment.
- I'm serious. Why?

41:34.060 --> 41:38.540
Because, Dr Fonseca... nothing compares.

41:39.340 --> 41:41.610
You are my one and only.

41:41.660 --> 41:44.010
I was born to love you.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.770
Are you quoting song titles?

41:45.820 --> 41:47.540
Possibly.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.970
I'm not ashamed of you.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.260
Oh, I think you are.

41:55.660 --> 41:59.180
In fact, shame is my secret weapon.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.050
I'm sexual chocolate.

42:02.100 --> 42:04.180
Every woman's guilty pleasure.

42:04.860 --> 42:07.380
The love that dare not speak its name.

42:08.180 --> 42:09.980
That name is Greg.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.810
OK. Cut the music.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.580
- Why?
- Just do it.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.450
Excuse me, everybody!

42:27.500 --> 42:29.210
Excuse me!

42:29.260 --> 42:31.060
I've got an announcement to make!

42:33.540 --> 42:35.340
Right...

42:36.540 --> 42:38.580
I just want everyone to know...

42:39.620 --> 42:42.930
.. that I am in a
relationship with this man.

42:44.860 --> 42:49.820
In fact, we have been sleeping
together for nearly three years.

42:50.460 --> 42:53.460
And he is, objectively...

42:55.140 --> 42:56.640
.. the best I've ever had...

42:57.700 --> 43:01.060
.. although his personal hygiene
leaves a lot to be desired.

43:03.340 --> 43:05.050
That's it.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.860
Thank you.

43:15.380 --> 43:17.380
Happy now?

43:19.700 --> 43:22.090
Surprised.

43:22.140 --> 43:24.260
In a good way.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.700
So what happens now?

43:28.980 --> 43:31.180
Nothing at all.

43:32.380 --> 43:34.260
In a good way.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.420
You're amazing.

43:51.340 --> 43:53.340
I think that was brave.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.460
Even if you and Greg are the
worst-kept secret in Barco.

44:04.940 --> 44:05.940
I just realised.

44:08.420 --> 44:10.340
I never really said thank you.

44:11.340 --> 44:13.090
For what?

44:13.140 --> 44:15.530
For not letting me leave.

44:15.580 --> 44:17.330
Me?

44:17.380 --> 44:19.690
Had nothing to do with me.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.640
You were always meant to be here.

44:25.660 --> 44:27.740
Karma, right?

44:28.700 --> 44:30.940
Something like that.
