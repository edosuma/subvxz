"A Thousand Words"
Closed Captioned

00:01.877 --> 00:02.961
Previously on 90210:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.463
Your billboard on
Hollywood Boulevard

00:04.588 --> 00:05.965
is literally stopping traffic.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.009
They're willing to sign you
to a very lucrative contract.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.469
What if all of the distance
between us

00:10.594 --> 00:12.680
suddenly vanished?
That'll be great.

00:12.805 --> 00:15.975
The person I'm having dinner
with just got here. I gotta go.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.100
What do you think, I've been
waiting my whole life

00:17.225 --> 00:18.519
for Miss Naomi Clark
to stand up to my dad?

00:18.644 --> 00:20.521
Austin, I was
just trying to help!

00:20.646 --> 00:22.230
Then you should have stayed
the hell out of it.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.316
What is she doing here?
Did she bring drugs

00:24.441 --> 00:25.192
into our hotel room?

00:25.317 --> 00:26.819
Annie, those are my drugs.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.195
I don't want you
to worry, okay?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.030
There are a lot
of great facilities in L.A.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.949
I just want you
to see what it's like

00:32.073 --> 00:35.118
to stand across the aisle
from another guy, you know?

00:35.243 --> 00:38.914
So just think of it as, um,
a no-stakes dress rehearsal.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.291
I'm standing in a wedding chapel

00:41.416 --> 00:43.878
in Las Vegas,
getting married to a dude.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.672
Silver, hurry up!
I'm not gonna hold
the jet for you.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.466
I'm coming.
Give me two seconds.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.849
ANNIE:
Okay, so I've done
a ton of research,

00:56.974 --> 00:58.600
and I found this
awesome rehab facility.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.644
It is one of the best
in the country,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.521
and even better, it's in Santa
Barbara, so you won't

01:02.646 --> 01:04.522
have to be that far away.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.819
$40,000?
Annie, we can't afford that.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.404
Dixon, we have
to get you better, okay?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.613
So what are we gonna do?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.574
Throw me a benefit
like we did Raj?

01:13.699 --> 01:14.074
Only instead of cancer,

01:14.199 --> 01:15.617
I'm a dropout loser

01:15.743 --> 01:17.202
with a drug problem.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.162
I can't wait to tell my friends.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.582
Look, the only other person
who knows is Adrianna,

01:21.707 --> 01:23.000
and I spoke to her.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.252
She's not gonna say anything.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.629
So we just need to come up with
$10,000 for the deposit,

01:27.755 --> 01:30.131
and we can tell everyone
that you were on

01:30.257 --> 01:32.091
tour with some music person.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.263
I don't know. I mean,

01:36.388 --> 01:37.932
I guess I could sell some
of my recording equipment.

01:38.057 --> 01:41.393
But even still,
I can't come up
with that kind of cash.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.144
You just concentrate on
getting better, okay?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.230
I will take care of the money.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.315
Okay, so where are
you getting $10,000?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.443
I said I'll take
care of it.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.570
I gotta go get ready
for a lunch date.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.250
Mmm! Dude, this coffee is
so much better

02:05.375 --> 02:07.127
than
hospital coffee.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.836
Don't get me wrong.
I'm very glad I was
there with you

02:08.963 --> 02:09.964
during the last week
of treatment...

02:10.089 --> 02:11.006
But the clinic is
a little oppressive.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.967
If I never have

02:13.092 --> 02:14.718
to be in a hospital again,
that would be so awesome.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.345
Well, the doctor's giving me
a couple days

02:17.471 --> 02:19.264
until I get
my blood results back,

02:19.389 --> 02:20.641
so until then, let's kick back

02:20.766 --> 02:23.018
and not think
about cancer for a while.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.645
I'll drink to that.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.771
Cheers.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.107
Ivy.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.484
Hey.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.904
Um, Raj, you know Nick,
my photography teacher.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.697
Hey.
How's it going?
Good, good.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.325
I haven't seen you around
lately. Everything okay?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.828
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.412
I just, Raj was getting
cancer treatment,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.539
so I thought it was
a little more important

02:44.665 --> 02:46.708
to be with him than
photography class.
No offense.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.210
Yeah, of course.
Um, I-I hope everything

02:49.336 --> 02:51.505
turns out okay.
Thank you.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.799
Since I have you here, I just
wanted to mention the C.U. show.

02:53.924 --> 02:54.758
It's a showcase

02:54.883 --> 02:57.052
for the university's best
photography students.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.929
First prize is a photo safari in
New Guinea

02:59.054 --> 03:01.306
with a working photojournalist.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.349
I think you have
a great shot.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.351
Ivy, that sounds pretty awesome.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.895
Yeah, that does sound awesome.

03:07.021 --> 03:09.648
Um, it's just Raj and I,
we just got back into town,

03:09.773 --> 03:12.109
so I don't think we're
gonna make any plans

03:12.233 --> 03:13.276
anytime soon, you know?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.278
Yeah, um, all right.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.238
Let me know if you change
your mind.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.074
Seriously, man, good luck.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.159
Thank you. Thank you.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.410
I like that guy.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.748
Yeah, no, he's... not horrible.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.208
Oh, my God. (laughs)

03:29.334 --> 03:30.585
Can I just tell you

03:30.711 --> 03:32.838
how nice it is
not to have anything on

03:32.963 --> 03:34.131
my schedule for a change?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.383
Naomi, hi. Yeah, take a seat.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.301
I'm guessing Austin
hasn't called you yet.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.970
Well, I hadn't even noticed.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.346
But sooner or later
he's gonna realize

03:41.471 --> 03:43.932
that what I did for him in Vegas
was for his own good.

03:44.058 --> 03:44.766
Really?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.935
Well, it sounds like you
just put your nose in

03:47.061 --> 03:48.729
his business and made everything
worse with his dad.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.023
Okay, it's the thought
that counts, Raj.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.858
And if he's too immature
to see that,

03:52.983 --> 03:56.195
then, well, he clearly sucks.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.821
Besides, I have plenty

03:57.946 --> 03:58.989
of friends. What do you guys
want to do today?

03:59.114 --> 04:00.949
Oh, babe, sorry.
We got plans already.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.368
Yeah, and since
we don't know how much longer

04:03.493 --> 04:04.578
I'm gonna be on this planet,

04:04.703 --> 04:08.790
we kinda wanted to spend
this weekend, you know, alone.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.626
Well, that seems
a bit selfish, don't you think?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.671
BOTH:
Yep.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.632
Okay, fine. You guys enjoy
each other's company.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.886
IVY:
Bye.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.346
(mutters)
We are selfish.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.229
There's my rock star!

04:30.353 --> 04:32.773
I'm a little busy
right now, Winter.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.233
Liam, this is
my boss, Sheila.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.400
She's a partner
at the agency.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.236
Your watch ads were
so successful

04:37.360 --> 04:38.403
that she's decided
to take over...

04:38.528 --> 04:40.405
Liam, it's so good
to meet you.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.782
What Winter is trying
to say is

04:41.907 --> 04:44.284
it's time to take your
career to the next level.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.286
I have no idea what that means.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.330
It means we have to pick out
your next ad campaign!

04:49.456 --> 04:51.416
Now, you could sell
shampoo

04:51.541 --> 04:54.253
or this really amazing
antiperspirant.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.338
Look, Sheila, the only reason
I'm still modeling is

04:57.464 --> 04:59.758
so I can afford to do
the things

04:59.883 --> 05:01.593
that I've never been able
to do before.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.470
I just want to enjoy life
for a change.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.596
And you can!

05:04.721 --> 05:07.182
Especially if you're
the cover model for

05:07.307 --> 05:10.435
Conquest of Desire.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.853
Middle-aged women everywhere
will be screaming your name.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.438
Um, no.

05:13.563 --> 05:18.193
Oh, I told you,
Liam is very particular.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.779
Which is why I saved
the best for last:

05:20.904 --> 05:23.282
Titus Cologne.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.908
This product transforms
the everyday man

05:25.033 --> 05:26.493
into the rugged adventurer,

05:26.618 --> 05:29.329
which means you'll have to look
good rock climbing

05:29.454 --> 05:30.872
or driving a race car or...

05:30.998 --> 05:32.166
Wait.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.459
Driving a race car?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.294
Yes.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.586
It's a two-year contract.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.713
It would be really good
for your career.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.756
Let me see.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.719
Okay.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.305
Sign me up.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.141
Fantastic.
I'll send over the paperwork.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.018
Oh, and please tell me
you're wearing sunscreen.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.435
We don't want wrinkles

05:52.560 --> 05:54.729
on that million-dollar face
of yours.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.529
It was mostly work, you know,

06:02.654 --> 06:04.281
but Vegas has a lot
of great restaurants.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.200
I really missed you, though.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.910
I really missed you, too.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.412
Hey, what's the matter?
You seem like you're distracted.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.581
No, I'm fine.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.126
Uh, actually, I've been having

06:16.251 --> 06:17.585
a lot of financial problems
lately.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.130
And I really, really hate
to ask you this, but...

06:20.255 --> 06:22.549
Would $5,000 help?

06:22.674 --> 06:25.844
Actually, ten would be better.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.471
Well, I'm glad money's
not an issue with us anymore.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.182
I hope you know

06:30.307 --> 06:33.727
I'm doing this
because I care about you.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.644
You're very special
to me, Annie.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.274
Ugh! I can't.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.734
I'm "special" to you?

06:40.859 --> 06:43.737
I saw you cheating in Vegas
with another woman, okay?!

06:43.862 --> 06:46.031
And you can't tell me
that she was your sister

06:46.156 --> 06:47.866
or your business partner,
because I could see

06:47.991 --> 06:48.825
exactly what was going on!

06:48.950 --> 06:52.746
Wow.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.664
That's it?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.584
No "Please forgive me, Annie,
I'll never do it again"?

06:57.709 --> 07:00.128
Yes, I was with another woman
in Vegas.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.464
And when I'm in L.A.,
I'm with you. I travel a lot,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.633
I hate to be alone,
so I hired an escort service,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.052
which if you recall,
is how we met.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.887
I thought you understood
the arrangement.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.680
(sighs)

07:10.805 --> 07:12.224
Oh, my God.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.684
Hey, details aside,
I never lied to you.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.311
You are very special to me,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.939
but our relationship is
what it is.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.066
I hope we can keep
seeing each other,

07:21.191 --> 07:22.734
but I'd understand if this
doesn't work for you.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.986
I...

07:25.112 --> 07:26.571
I have to go.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.455
(bar patrons cheering)

07:35.580 --> 07:38.166
SILVER: To tomorrow and
the election being over!

07:38.292 --> 07:40.001
BOTH:
Here, here!

07:40.127 --> 07:41.711
Cheers.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.257
Mmm, 14 videos in 40 days.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.841
I'm exhausted!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.718
Be glad you didn't have
to stand onstage

07:48.843 --> 07:50.345
for six weeks, shaking hands
and kissing babies.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.389
I just hope
all our hard work pays off.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.433
And that Marissa beats your
uncle and restores sanity

07:54.557 --> 07:55.767
and gay rights to Washington.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.560
Come on. The campaign is over.
Stop the rhetoric.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.104
We need to figure out
what we're doing

07:59.229 --> 08:00.397
with the rest
of our lives.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.190
Mmm, no more politics for me.
I am out.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.234
I could use a vacation.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.694
Maybe we could pick back up
where we left off in Barcelona.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.862
Mmm.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.364
I don't have to go anywhere.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.991
For the first time in
a long time

08:11.116 --> 08:12.367
everything feels
like it's supposed to.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.035
You know, I have my family,
I have my friends.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.245
Yep.
And I have you.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.579
I will drink to that.

08:16.704 --> 08:17.747
BOTH:
Cheers.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.045
Uh, Silver?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.550
REPORTER:
...tabloids.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.346
In this late-breaking story,
a video has been leaked

08:32.471 --> 08:35.722
by an anonymous source in which
congressional candidate

08:35.849 --> 08:39.019
Charles Sanderson's nephew,
Teddy Montgomery,

08:39.144 --> 08:41.270
can be seen participating in
a gay wedding.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.981
(gasps)

08:43.106 --> 08:46.901
So, yeah, I'm standing in
a Vegas wedding chapel

08:47.027 --> 08:48.236
getting married to a dude

08:48.362 --> 08:52.699
by another dude dressed
as Elvis.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.703
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.247
REPORTER: Early polling
indicates there has been

08:59.373 --> 09:01.875
a backlash from candidate
Sanderson's conservative base.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.378
Good news for Marissa
Harris-Young

09:04.503 --> 09:08.923
who now appears poised to win
tomorrow's special election.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.633
Oh, my God.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.111
It doesn't make sense.
No one else had

09:30.237 --> 09:31.738
access to that video.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.573
Yeah. I wonder
where they got it.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.367
Wait a minute. You think I had
something to do with that?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.659
Well, I know Silver didn't.
Hey...

09:36.784 --> 09:37.952
All you've talked about

09:38.078 --> 09:39.287
for the last month is how badly

09:39.413 --> 09:40.914
you wanted to get your
"gay rights" message out.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.623
Teddy, there has got
to be another explanation.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.085
Yeah? Like what?

09:45.210 --> 09:48.713
You've never accepted the fact
that your cause wasn't my cause.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.299
Well, congratulations.
You got the idiot nephew

09:51.425 --> 09:53.343
to torpedo his uncle's campaign.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.678
I'm stupid to ever trust you.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.637
Teddy...?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.598
Teddy!

10:15.449 --> 10:17.867
Annie! You're not bogged down
with a boyfriend.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.827
Take a study break
and come hang out with me.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.661
I want to spend
some cash.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.372
Actually, a lot of cash.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.457
Uh, I'm not studying.
I'm busy.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.874
Doing what?

10:24.999 --> 10:27.461
Selling everything that
Patrick has ever given me.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.337
Oh, well, that's a good idea.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.671
Purge yourself of
the bad memories

10:30.797 --> 10:31.798
of having a rich boyfriend,

10:31.923 --> 10:33.592
and we'll take all
the money you have

10:33.716 --> 10:34.884
and go to Baja
this weekend.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.761
I'm sorry.
I have something else I need

10:36.886 --> 10:38.221
to spend money on.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.889
Okay, fine.
Don't worry about me.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.724
I will just go hang out
by myself.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.019
Do not sell my purse.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.897
Alana! There you are. Hey, where
are the rest of the Zetas?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.941
I was thinking maybe we could
all chill, you know,

10:50.066 --> 10:51.151
braid each other's hair.
(chuckles)

10:51.276 --> 10:54.028
Um...
they're all out having lives?

10:54.154 --> 10:57.198
Okay... (clears throat)

10:57.324 --> 10:58.408
It's not possible

10:58.533 --> 11:01.369
that everyone has something
to do except me!

11:01.495 --> 11:03.746
Oh, wait.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.666
Oh, you're sad and lonely.
Maybe we should hang out.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.670
Uh, we don't really have
anything in common.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.255
And I'm not looking for
another makeover.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.923
This is a terrible book.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.759
Look, I don't care that we're
from different backgrounds

11:16.884 --> 11:19.095
or different social
circles or whatever it is.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.347
We can still hang out.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.890
I'll even let you choose
what we do for fun.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.934
Really?
Yes, really.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.353
We'll have the time of
our lives. It'll be amazing!

11:26.478 --> 11:27.646
Come on, what
do you say?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.605
'Kay.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.897
Yay!
(laughs)

11:30.023 --> 11:32.317
♪ ♪

11:36.530 --> 11:37.947
What do you want
to do tonight?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.241
Want to go to the
skate park maybe

11:40.367 --> 11:44.412
or, I don't know, catch
a flick or something?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.414
How about we enter you
in that photo show

11:46.540 --> 11:47.582
Nick was talking about?

11:47.706 --> 11:49.501
Okay, Raj, I started,
like, a month ago,

11:49.626 --> 11:52.253
and I don't even
go to class anymore.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.297
Plus, if it was something
I was really passionate about,

11:54.422 --> 11:55.965
clearly I wouldn't have
just stopped doing it.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.718
Like surfing?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.137
Ivy, when I was
getting treatment,

12:01.262 --> 12:02.514
I started feeling something

12:02.639 --> 12:05.559
that I hadn't felt
in a really long time.

12:05.684 --> 12:06.309
Hope.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.811
Ivy, I was at UCLA
for pre-med.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.146
I even took my MCATs
and everything.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.147
Whoa, you wanted to go to
medical school?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.607
I didn't know that.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.692
We never talked
about our future

12:13.816 --> 12:16.819
because we didn't
think we had one.

12:16.944 --> 12:20.407
So maybe it's time
that we start acting like we do.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.618
So, Ivy Sullivan, what do you
want to do with your life?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.260
Hey, you know that designer
purse that you borrowed,

12:40.385 --> 12:41.595
the one Patrick
gave me?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.970
I need it back.

12:43.096 --> 12:43.971
Is everything okay?

12:44.097 --> 12:44.889
Not really.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.057
It's here.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.434
That means I've had it
the entire time.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.519
But how did they
get the footage?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.938
Maybe I could help if I had any
clue what you're talking about.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.189
Someone leaked the video
that I shot

12:53.314 --> 12:54.441
of Teddy's wedding to the press,

12:54.566 --> 12:55.900
which is impossible

12:56.025 --> 12:58.612
because no one else
had access to it except for me.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.946
Oh, my God.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.155
Wait a minute.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.241
No, no, no, no, no.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.992
Marissa...

13:06.869 --> 13:10.415
So yeah. I'm standing in a Vegas
wedding chapel...

13:10.540 --> 13:12.166
Oh, my God!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.586
I sent it
to the campaign office!

13:14.711 --> 13:16.379
This is all my fault. Someone
there must have leaked it.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.298
I-I got to find out who did.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.716
Okay.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.636
I guess I'll just
get that purse back later.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.099
Um, hey.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.100
Hi.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.685
Can I speak to you
for a second?

13:30.809 --> 13:33.354
Yeah, sure.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.316
Uh, I'll be one minute.
Sorry.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.735
What's going on?

13:38.859 --> 13:42.781
Um, okay, look, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.282
Uh...

13:44.407 --> 13:45.659
(chuckles)

13:45.784 --> 13:46.993
Okay.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.328
Are we a couple?

13:48.453 --> 13:50.163
Or did you just

13:50.288 --> 13:53.708
have sex with me in Vegas
just to keep me away from drugs?

13:53.832 --> 13:55.918
Look, I just need to know
if you have any feelings

13:56.043 --> 13:57.629
towards me whatsoever,

13:57.754 --> 14:00.465
'cause I definitely have
feelings for you.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.134
Of course
I have feelings for you.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.051
Really?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.428
Mm-hmm.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.805
(sighs)
Well, um, cool.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.348
Whew!

14:08.473 --> 14:09.098
(both laugh)

14:09.223 --> 14:10.891
Th-That's awesome.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.688
Um, you know, 'cause I know
Annie talked to you about

14:14.813 --> 14:17.982
keeping the, keeping the whole
drug thing a secret,

14:18.107 --> 14:19.900
but we don't have to
keep us a secret, right?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.154
Maybe you should
talk to Annie about that.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.948
Uh, what do you mean?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.785
I like you,

14:28.909 --> 14:31.162
and I was going to call
you when you got back

14:31.287 --> 14:33.998
from Vegas, but Annie
asked me to stay away.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.250
And why would she do that?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.294
Because she's your sister.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.920
She's just being protective.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.215
Yeah, well, sister or not, she
doesn't get to control my life.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.884
Dixon.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.974
Beautiful.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.685
Again.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.269
Stay with that.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.563
Okay, good.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.021
Now, climb
inside. Yeah?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.815
Absolutely.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.776
There it is.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.985
Look out here.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.362
Perfect.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.782
Okay, that's a wrap
for the wonderful Liam.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.616
That's it?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.788
Who's this guy?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.373
(engine revving)

15:15.498 --> 15:17.291
Sheila!

15:21.379 --> 15:23.297
They're not letting me
drive the car.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.383
Well, of course
they're not.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.551
What do you mean,
"Of course not"?

15:26.676 --> 15:27.761
The whole reason
I took the job

15:27.886 --> 15:29.178
was so I could
drive the race car.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.389
Liam, no company
in their right mind

15:31.514 --> 15:33.266
would let their star model
drive a race car.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.726
It's far too dangerous.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.687
That's why there's a
clause in your contract

15:37.812 --> 15:39.021
that forbids you
from participating

15:39.146 --> 15:40.398
in any risky activity.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.274
Wait, what?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.817
While you're under contract,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.486
you can't, um, rock climb, surf,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.988
ride a motorcycle

15:48.114 --> 15:50.950
or do anything that might damage
that beautiful face of yours.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.536
Not on camera or
off, I'm afraid.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.872
So basically
what you're saying is

15:55.996 --> 15:57.498
I just signed my life away?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.083
Well, at least it pays well.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.126
(cell phone ringing)

16:00.251 --> 16:02.462
I got to take this.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.766
Am I nuts here?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.726
I mean, fine, I don't
get to drive a race car

16:16.851 --> 16:17.977
for their stupid
commercial,

16:18.102 --> 16:19.479
but they get to control
my personal life?

16:19.604 --> 16:20.772
Is that even legal?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.022
It's like when I was
dating Joe Jonas.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.065
You know, when you're famous,

16:23.190 --> 16:24.024
they want you to live
this fake life

16:24.150 --> 16:25.652
and put on a show.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.320
Dude, how awesome
are the waves today?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.697
Felt like we
were in Maui.

16:29.823 --> 16:30.782
Beer me, bro.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.408
You know what?

16:32.533 --> 16:34.494
To hell with this.
I'm going surfing.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.703
What about the contract?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.914
What they don't know
can't hurt them.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.925
Yo. You told Ade
to stay away from me?

16:49.049 --> 16:50.468
Uh, hello.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.094
Just answer the question.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.471
Okay, yes, I did.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.431
I don't think she's
the best influence.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.432
Especially not right now...

16:56.557 --> 16:57.851
You do not get
to make that call.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.102
You have no idea what's going on
in my life right now.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.062
Okay, that is not fair.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.731
I am doing everything
that I can

17:03.857 --> 17:04.983
to help you.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.693
I'm practically
killing myself so I can

17:06.818 --> 17:08.694
get this money so I can drive
you up to rehab on Saturday.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.780
I don't want you
to drive me up on Saturday.

17:10.905 --> 17:11.823
I want Ade to drive me.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.992
What? Why would you say that?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.160
Because I'm sick of you trying
to control my life, Annie!

17:17.453 --> 17:18.538
Look, who the hell are you

17:18.663 --> 17:20.330
to even tell Ade
to stay away from me?

17:20.455 --> 17:21.207
She came to Vegas to save me.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.084
Dixon, I am your sister.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.670
I want to help you.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.130
Ade's the most important person
in my life right now.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.633
Not you.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.649
Oh, hey, surf's amazing
out there today.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.526
We love you, Liam!

17:48.651 --> 17:50.110
I'm totally
tweeting this.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.572
I wonder if I can
make money from it.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.828
Blender.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.914
Mascara. Jewelry.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.749
No, silly.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.124
It's the Periodic Table
of Elements.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.586
That's something you find
around the house?

18:06.711 --> 18:07.670
Fine, I'll go again.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.756
Oh, please stop.
If I have to endure this game

18:09.881 --> 18:11.925
for one more minute, I swear
to God, I will bake a cake

18:12.050 --> 18:13.467
six stories high
and jump off the top of it.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.053
I thought you were
having a good time.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.679
Are you?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.724
I mean, isn't there a hobby

18:19.849 --> 18:22.268
you'd rather be doing,
some unfulfilled dream?

18:22.393 --> 18:23.394
Reach for the stars.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.440
Well...

18:27.565 --> 18:30.109
There is this boy.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.151
A boy?

18:31.277 --> 18:32.904
Boys are my specialty.

18:33.029 --> 18:33.905
Come on.

18:34.030 --> 18:34.906
His name is Stanley.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.574
Stanley.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.034
He's in
my Organic Chemistry class,

18:38.158 --> 18:40.036
but I haven't had the courage
to talk to him yet.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.079
We are totally
going to fix this.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.539
Naomi, please.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.665
I don't want you to interfere.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.627
Listen, I am fine being alone.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.169
Seriously, I'm strong that way.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.422
You, on the other hand...

18:51.547 --> 18:54.842
We're going to find Stanley and
you are going to rock his world!

18:54.968 --> 18:58.012
(laughs)

19:06.771 --> 19:08.856
Hey, Marissa.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.316
Silver.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.442
Hi. Excuse me.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.902
This is it.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.362
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.197
Tomorrow, we can start
turning this country

19:17.323 --> 19:18.658
into a better place.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.910
Um, hey, look, I
have to ask you

19:21.035 --> 19:22.411
about that video
that got leaked.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.414
I've been going over
it in my head, and...

19:25.539 --> 19:27.416
it had to have come out
of your office.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.043
I don't know
how to say this, but...

19:29.168 --> 19:31.462
You're asking me
if I leaked the tape.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.255
I'm sorry, okay?

19:33.380 --> 19:35.091
I don't know what to think.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.844
Yes. I did.

19:37.969 --> 19:41.597
You leaked it?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.308
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.601
Listen, that tape
was invaluable.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.186
It completely pushed us
over the edge.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.938
How could you do that?

19:49.063 --> 19:52.025
You had to have known that I
sent that tape by accident.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.778
I mean... you betrayed me.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.573
And you ruined
my best friend's life.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.201
Look, Silver,
I love your passion,

20:02.326 --> 20:03.828
your energy and the fact

20:03.953 --> 20:05.955
that you're so idealistic.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.915
But a part of growing up is

20:08.041 --> 20:10.250
realizing how this world
really works.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.628
I did what I had
to do to win.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.214
And now, I'm going to do a lot
of good for a lot of people,

20:15.339 --> 20:17.800
including your friend.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.970
He may be upset now,
but he will get over it.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.680
And I hope that you will, too.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.976
(crowd cheering)

20:35.068 --> 20:36.485
Thank you,

20:36.610 --> 20:39.030
thank you, thank you,
my friends.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.323
Today is a beautiful day.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.701
A day that we worked
so hard to make happen.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.163
So this is not just my victory,
it's our victory.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.833
So congratulations.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.960
(crowd cheering)

20:58.007 --> 21:00.801
♪ ♪

21:06.057 --> 21:08.350
Ivy, this looks
fantastic.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.352
Aren't you glad you entered?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.730
Now everyone is going to see

21:12.855 --> 21:14.648
what an amazing photographer
you are.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.608
Well, maybe I'm not
amazing, Raj,

21:15.733 --> 21:17.276
but it looks pretty cool,
doesn't it?

21:17.401 --> 21:18.527
Yep.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.947
And once you win
first place,

21:21.072 --> 21:22.698
you and I both are gonna have
something to celebrate.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.490
Oh, yeah? What's that?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.325
This afternoon,

21:25.451 --> 21:26.744
I applied to Johns Hopkins.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.789
What do you mean
you applied to Johns Hopkins?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.124
Like, in-in Maryland?

21:31.249 --> 21:31.999
Yeah.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.500
It has one of

21:33.626 --> 21:35.294
the premier cancer research
facilities in the world.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.631
I know that, Raj,
and that's amazing for you.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.175
I just... Oh, God, I don't know.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.802
That's just, like,
really, really far away.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.470
Yeah, well, so is New Guinea.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.554
Yeah, but that's...

21:45.679 --> 21:47.598
Look, if you win this trip,

21:47.723 --> 21:49.725
if I beat cancer,

21:49.850 --> 21:54.230
if I get in to medical school,
we're gonna figure this out.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.189
Together.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.775
All right?
Mm-hmm.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.404
NAOMI (chuckling):
Okay.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.865
Let's go find
this dreamboat,

22:04.991 --> 22:07.243
so you two can live
happily ever after.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.957
Oh, my God. There he is.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.458
That's Stanley?

22:15.375 --> 22:18.879
I mean, wow.
What a catch.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.090
What are you
waiting for? Go.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.300
Seduce him. Woo him.

22:22.424 --> 22:22.883
Make him yours.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.052
Right.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.474
I don't know what to do.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.559
Oh, my God. You have
a 6,000-point GPA

22:32.685 --> 22:34.895
and you don't know how
to flirt with a boy?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.981
Okay, fine.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.649
First, lead off
with a little laugh.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.068
Something that says,
"I'm having a good time.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.569
Don't you wish
you were, too?"

22:45.072 --> 22:46.282
(cackling)

22:46.406 --> 22:48.242
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey! Hey!

22:48.366 --> 22:51.704
Let's... forget the laugh.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.706
We'll skip right
to the eye contact part.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.209
Just a casual look--
a glance that says,

22:56.334 --> 22:59.920
"I'm interested,
but not too interested."

23:05.218 --> 23:07.761
Honey, you're not
trying to hypnotize him.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.971
(sighs) This is hopeless.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.223
We should just go home.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.183
No, it's...
Oh, no, it's working.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.976
He's coming
over here. Hi.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.895
Hello, ladies.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.689
Hi. I'm Naomi Clark.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.274
This beautiful creature here
is Alana Gordon.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.068
Would you care
to join us?

23:22.193 --> 23:23.569
Don't mind if I do.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.408
Oh.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.245
(chuckles)

23:32.370 --> 23:35.373
Well... this is cozy.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.415
Um, you know what?
You two get better acquainted.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.835
I'm going to get us
some drinks.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.337
(whimpers)

23:41.461 --> 23:43.005
(laughs nervously)

23:44.590 --> 23:45.507
Alana, what
are you doing?

23:45.632 --> 23:48.052
I'm not ready to
be alone with him.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.469
Okay, fine.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.637
Um, I'll go
butter him up.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.597
You get us
some drinks.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.515
Make mine a double
with a double chaser.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.808
Right.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.521
Nice job ditching
the other chick.

23:59.646 --> 24:00.398
I beg your pardon.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.440
I saw the looks
you were giving me.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.817
Huh? (chuckles)

24:03.943 --> 24:05.236
No, no, no.

24:05.361 --> 24:05.903
I wasn't flirting
with you.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.863
Alana was.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.949
Actually, she's who you should
be hitting on right now.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.867
You know, brainy girls
really aren't my type.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.203
You, however...

24:14.328 --> 24:17.123
you are just what
the doctor ordered.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.499
(whimpers)

24:22.460 --> 24:24.255
(sighs)

24:35.724 --> 24:38.102
Okay. You've been
following me all night.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.645
You think you can give me
a little space?

24:42.064 --> 24:43.274
(sighs)

24:43.399 --> 24:44.482
A little more.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.864
That's what you get
for being in the public eye.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.699
Fans won't
leave you alone.
She's not a fan.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.034
She's my agent's
assistant.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.829
And, evidently,
my new babysitter.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.831
Her job is to make sure
I'm not having any fun!

24:58.956 --> 25:00.707
Ever.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.004
Man, look at how happy
we were.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.964
Yeah, and free.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.383
I'd give anything
to have that back.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.884
I can't even go
into a coffee shop

25:11.010 --> 25:11.593
without someone
taking a picture.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.140
Hey. You want
to ditch these people

25:16.265 --> 25:17.891
and get out of here?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.102
(sighs)
That'd be fantastic.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.355
Let's go.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.940
SILVER:
Hey.

25:25.065 --> 25:25.899
Teddy, there
you are.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.109
Can we talk
for a second?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.861
Uh, look, I really got
to get out of here.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.488
We'll talk later.
I promise.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.822
Okay.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.200
(sighs)

25:40.039 --> 25:41.790
You have got to be
freaking kidding me.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.460
Have you not done enough damage
in your own life?

25:44.584 --> 25:46.544
Now you want to turn
my own brother against me?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.172
Annie, I had to tell Dixon
what you said.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.465
Okay? He has feelings for me,

25:49.589 --> 25:50.716
and he doesn't want
to keep them a secret.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.926
Yeah, well, he has feelings
for me now, too.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.137
He hates me, while I'm over here

25:55.262 --> 25:57.139
killing myself
trying to pay for his rehab.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.391
Dixon doesn't hate you.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.185
He doesn't want me driving him

26:01.310 --> 26:02.728
to Santa Barbara;
he wants you.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.605
Because I'm not important
in his life anymore.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.607
That doesn't sound like Dixon.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.904
Oh, my God.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.613
He's still using.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.948
No, no.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.616
He stopped after Vegas.
He promised.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.993
No. Dixon can't.
He's an addict.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.038
And when you're addicted,
you say things you don't mean,

26:21.163 --> 26:23.581
and you feel things
that aren't real.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.295
I mean, he said some things
to me, too.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.880
But that wasn't Dixon
saying those things.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.173
It was his addiction.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.845
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.266
Listen, Dixon loves you.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.395
And he's just not himself
right now.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.981
And we have to be there
for him-- both of us--

26:48.107 --> 26:50.692
no matter how hard that is.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.610
(sighs)

26:54.363 --> 26:55.613
STANLEY:
Hello, doll face.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.656
Oh, my God. Seriously?

26:56.782 --> 26:58.951
Stanley, I told you,
I am not interested.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.328
Here's something you
should know about me--

27:01.454 --> 27:04.081
when I see something
I want, I take it.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.375
And I want you.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.710
(sighs) Okay, you know what?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.213
I may appear to be
the perfect woman,

27:11.338 --> 27:12.630
but I have my shortcomings.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.050
I don't care, because
you are so beautiful.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.302
Yes, on the outside,

27:16.427 --> 27:17.386
obviously,
I'm incredibly hot--

27:17.511 --> 27:19.096
and frankly,
out of your league--

27:19.221 --> 27:20.431
but on the inside...

27:20.556 --> 27:22.475
I'm a horrible girlfriend.
I am.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.684
I'm... I'm selfish.
I'm superficial.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.685
I'm vain.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.729
I shove my nose
into everybody's business.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.899
I will judge you,
manipulate you, lie to you.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.402
If you take away my hair

27:33.527 --> 27:35.195
and you take away...

27:35.321 --> 27:37.156
my face,

27:37.281 --> 27:38.949
this is what
you're left with, okay?

27:39.074 --> 27:42.744
Trust me, you don't want to be
in a relationship with me.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.456
You are H-O-T hot.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.082
Oh, my God.
What do you say

27:47.207 --> 27:48.584
we get out of here before
dork girl comes back?

27:53.922 --> 27:55.633
Alana.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.355
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.232
I can see the life
that I want.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.651
It's just out
of reach.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.028
I don't know
what's worse--

28:16.153 --> 28:19.072
that or actually having
the life you want

28:19.198 --> 28:20.866
and watching it
getting ripped away.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.162
(sighs)

28:25.287 --> 28:26.539
I guess they both suck.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.583
Yeah.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.962
You know what?
