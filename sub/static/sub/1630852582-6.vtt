WEBVTT

00:08.958 --> 00:10.833
I will not withdraw
my whistleblower complaint.

00:22.708 --> 00:24.000
Are you insane?

00:24.083 --> 00:25.000
REQUEST TO RE-OPEN INVESTIGATION
INTO CORPORATIONS RECEIVING SUBSIDIES

00:25.083 --> 00:26.833
We're talking company profits,

00:26.916 --> 00:30.250
and by extension, a project that will lead
to the development of the country.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.250
Why get in the way of that?

00:32.750 --> 00:35.083
I can't take this any longer, Mr. Toyoda.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.958
I've had it with your chicanery.

00:38.041 --> 00:41.041
Your extraction of subsidies
for AI technology that doesn't exist

00:41.583 --> 00:43.750
is nothing less than criminal!

00:54.666 --> 00:55.833
Matsuda.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.208
Look out there.

00:58.791 --> 00:59.750
Come on.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.166
Your self-righteous behavior

01:03.875 --> 01:07.000
will toss everyone here
out on the street without work.

01:10.166 --> 01:13.750
Do you think your whistleblower complaint
is going to make anyone happy?

01:14.583 --> 01:16.333
In fact, it's the exact opposite.

01:16.416 --> 01:18.208
How can you say
it's the right thing to do?

01:19.708 --> 01:20.541
Can you?

01:22.083 --> 01:23.791
Help me out here, Matsuda.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.958
I want this company to be a success.

01:28.583 --> 01:29.958
Work with me, okay?

01:31.416 --> 01:36.833
Even if it's not possible now,
it's our job to make it a reality, right?

01:38.416 --> 01:39.416
Right?

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
<i>The future of politics</i>
<i>is in giving a good performance.</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:51.333
<i>If you put on a show</i>
<i>for the public with this in mind,</i>

01:51.958 --> 01:54.250
<i>it will be easy to maintain</i>
<i>this administration.</i>

01:58.291 --> 02:00.500
This problem can't be
dealt with through performance.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.625
Hello?

02:24.583 --> 02:26.166
<i>Check if you're being followed.</i>

02:26.666 --> 02:28.625
<i>It's possible both you and I</i>
<i>are being watched.</i>

02:34.958 --> 02:36.000
It's all clear.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.041
<i>Come inside.</i>

02:40.625 --> 02:41.458
Okay.

03:03.708 --> 03:04.791
Aren't you…

04:06.791 --> 04:10.625
CABINET SECRETARIAT, CIRO,
SHINICHI MURAKAMI

04:15.458 --> 04:17.208
You're in CIRO?

04:20.583 --> 04:21.750
Since when?

04:23.125 --> 04:25.875
I am not at liberty to answer that.

04:31.791 --> 04:33.208
How do you know my brother?

04:36.583 --> 04:40.375
When Kohei was assigned
to work in the Cabinet Secretariat,

04:42.875 --> 04:44.250
we worked together.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.166
Is that right?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.666
Well,

04:54.125 --> 04:56.500
you know who Shinjiro Toyoda is,
don't you?

04:57.916 --> 04:58.833
Yes.

04:59.375 --> 05:04.375
Did you know that it was Kohei who filed
the whistleblower complaint on Toyoda?

05:05.708 --> 05:06.583
Yes.

05:08.833 --> 05:12.416
No matter how many times I asked Toyoda,
he would never confirm it,

05:14.250 --> 05:15.916
but I am sure of it.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.958
He's trying to bury everything,

05:23.750 --> 05:26.000
even the complaint
that Kohei courageously filed.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.708
Even the arrest warrant failed.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.416
The police investigated after new evidence
surfaced at the Ministry of Economy.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.208
But

05:37.791 --> 05:40.000
even that investigation was called off.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.583
As long as Toyoda
is a special advisor to the Cabinet,

05:50.791 --> 05:52.375
his crimes will remain buried.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.875
That's right. Exactly.

05:53.958 --> 05:57.083
Toyoda knows too much
about the secrets of this administration.

06:00.791 --> 06:01.875
How come

06:03.375 --> 06:07.333
someone like you in CIRO
is going after Toyoda?

06:11.333 --> 06:14.041
I am not at liberty to answer that either.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.041
Then,

06:16.875 --> 06:19.125
why did you contact me out of the blue?

06:26.541 --> 06:28.916
That's because…

06:31.333 --> 06:32.916
Is it about the Eishin Academy affair?

06:37.166 --> 06:38.291
Mr. Murakami…

06:41.166 --> 06:43.125
Mr. Suzuki's wife, Mayumi,

06:43.208 --> 06:45.333
<i>is preparing</i>
<i>to file suit against the government.</i>

06:45.833 --> 06:47.458
We're getting signatures at a good pace.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.375
Yes.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.333
<i>If the PM admits involvement,</i>
<i>his wife will be properly compensated,</i>

06:52.708 --> 06:55.666
and people's awareness might change.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.875
Won't you please give testimony?

07:10.208 --> 07:11.333
Please.

07:12.708 --> 07:16.458
This country has got to change.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.208
I--

07:27.500 --> 07:28.666
Excuse me.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.708
INCOMING CALL
TOMOYA TADA

07:33.875 --> 07:36.833
Please. I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.125
I cannot be part of anything
that would cause turmoil

07:40.208 --> 07:41.458
for the current administration.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.583
I am a bureaucrat.

07:56.625 --> 07:57.916
Sorry for being late.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.333
Thank you for coming.

07:59.416 --> 08:02.083
Matsuda, we've got over 20,000 signatures.

08:02.666 --> 08:05.208
There are plenty of calls
on social media to pursue this.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.666
-I'm certain this will go well.
-Thank you.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.625
It's good for it to gain attention.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.666
It could give us insights
from unexpected sources.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.625
How about this?

08:18.166 --> 08:21.583
You could take this opportunity
to appear on television.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.333
What?

08:25.750 --> 08:27.083
Can we do that?

08:27.166 --> 08:29.916
Yes. I know several people
at television stations.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.125
I can at least contact them.

08:37.541 --> 08:39.458
I think it's a good idea,

08:40.083 --> 08:43.166
but if she appears on TV,
more people could try to interfere.

08:44.541 --> 08:45.416
I'll do it.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.625
Please.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.291
Even if there's only a small chance
that something will come of it,

08:52.958 --> 08:54.458
I want to try.

08:55.416 --> 08:59.458
I'm certain that's
what my husband wants as well.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.458
Thank you so much, Mrs. Mayumi.

09:04.541 --> 09:05.916
You too, Ms. Matsuda.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.416
I'll see you at the station.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.166
Actually,

09:10.083 --> 09:13.500
there's someone else that I'd like to see.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.375
Do you have time after this, Ms. Matsuda?

09:17.291 --> 09:18.833
Yes, I'm free.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.625
Do you mean Ryo?

09:22.875 --> 09:23.875
No.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.041
Ryo!

09:34.125 --> 09:36.500
Hey, Nakano. I heard you got a job offer.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.750
-Congratulations.
-It was down to the wire.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.458
I never thought it would be this hard.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.125
-I heard you got a job at Touto News.
-Yes.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.791
That's totally awesome.

09:46.291 --> 09:47.625
It was pure chance.

09:47.708 --> 09:48.875
Give me a break.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.166
Don't let that nasty reporter bully you.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.208
Watch what you say.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.208
-Did you hear?
-About what?

09:57.291 --> 09:59.541
There's no graduation
this year due to coronavirus.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.333
-Seriously?
-I mean, the situation is pretty bad.

10:03.416 --> 10:06.666
I heard some companies
were canceling their job offers.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.000
I'm sure Touto News is fine,

10:10.083 --> 10:13.625
but start-ups and mid-sized firms
are in pretty bad shape.

10:15.666 --> 10:16.916
Is that right?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.208
Yes.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.708
That would totally suck.

10:20.791 --> 10:23.041
After all our hard work to get a job,

10:23.125 --> 10:26.000
to get your job offer canceled would suck.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.666
<i>Our company does</i>
<i>a lot of sightseeing-related work,</i>

10:29.750 --> 10:33.083
so we've taken a huge hit
from this coronavirus.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.625
I'm terribly sorry about this.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.666
This doesn't make any sense.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.041
How can you do this
after giving an official job offer?

10:47.666 --> 10:48.791
I know.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.041
But if this keeps up,

10:51.125 --> 10:54.916
we don't even know if the company
will make it through the year.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.791
<i>As the number of those infected with</i>
<i>the novel coronavirus increases daily,</i>

11:00.875 --> 11:03.500
<i>people are feeling more and more insecure.</i>

130,000 SIGNATURES COLLECTED DEMANDING

11:05.916 --> 11:07.333
FORMER FINANCE BUREAU
DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI

11:07.416 --> 11:08.583
TESTIFY AGAIN IN EISHIN SCANDAL

11:40.791 --> 11:41.791
Mr. Mouri.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.208
I'm Anna Matsuda from Touto News.

11:51.083 --> 11:54.041
I am Kazuya Suzuki's wife.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.125
After Mr. Suzuki's note came out,

12:01.083 --> 12:04.166
you know that society's opinion
has changed greatly, don't you?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.625
What are you doing here? Leave me alone.

12:08.708 --> 12:10.875
I'm no longer a bureaucrat.

12:10.958 --> 12:15.541
Mrs. Suzuki has something
that she wants to ask you.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
-This doesn't concern me anymore.
-Mr. Mouri!

12:22.333 --> 12:24.458
Won't you please properly explain

12:26.416 --> 12:28.791
the situation behind
the altering of the documents?

12:31.708 --> 12:33.125
What caused this to happen?

12:35.375 --> 12:37.750
I'm sure you know that better than anyone.

12:40.916 --> 12:42.125
Won't you please…

12:43.875 --> 12:47.041
won't you please testify again
and tell the truth?

12:56.583 --> 12:59.583
I've already testified
to everything that I know.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.791
The prime minister was not involved.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.750
It was…

13:15.750 --> 13:17.208
it was I…

13:18.791 --> 13:20.291
who gave all the orders.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.875
For what happened to Mr. Suzuki…

13:29.208 --> 13:30.958
I am terribly sorry.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.583
I'm sorry.

13:39.458 --> 13:40.541
I'm sorry.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.083
I'm sorry.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.541
Mrs. Mayumi…

14:01.791 --> 14:03.083
I doubt…

14:06.000 --> 14:07.875
we'll get him to testify again.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.208
Thank you.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.125
Come in.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.625
<i>Thank you for taking the time to come.</i>

14:37.208 --> 14:39.125
Since my superiors
won't approve an investigation,

14:39.666 --> 14:41.625
my only choice is to act independently.

14:42.541 --> 14:43.666
Is that right?

14:44.583 --> 14:45.458
Have a seat.

14:52.416 --> 14:56.333
However, if I can gather evidence,
the case will be reopened.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.375
Also,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.166
this questioning is still
completely voluntary, so rest at ease.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.750
Will you give a statement?

15:11.000 --> 15:11.875
Yes.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.875
I'm prepared for
whatever punishment I may be given.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.416
Then…

15:22.375 --> 15:23.500
If I may?

15:28.125 --> 15:30.541
I apologize for being so direct,

15:30.625 --> 15:33.000
but I'd like to know
whether there was any involvement

15:33.083 --> 15:36.000
by the Prime Minister's Office
and the Ministry of Finance in this case?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.791
To be specific,

15:41.791 --> 15:43.750
did the Prime Minister's Office
issue orders

15:44.541 --> 15:47.041
to former Finance Bureau
Director-General Mouri?

15:56.083 --> 15:57.583
I heard that…

15:59.583 --> 16:02.208
the First Lady's assistant,
Mr. Murakami, gave the order.

16:09.625 --> 16:13.750

16:25.083 --> 16:32.083
CAN WE TALK AGAIN?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.625
I've read almost all your books, sir.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.333
-That was a great article.
-Thank you.

16:52.416 --> 16:54.416
Sir, we've gathered
a nice group of cuties.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.750
<i>She wants to be a newscaster.</i>

17:00.166 --> 17:01.791
You've always said it was magnificent.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.416
Well, then.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.708
Cheers!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.333
USED COMPANY FUNDS TO…

17:25.708 --> 17:27.041
TOKYO METROPOLITAN POLICE
PUBLIC SECURITY BUREAU

17:52.458 --> 17:53.500
RECEIVED ONE MILLION YEN…

17:55.208 --> 17:56.875
RUMORED TO USE DRUGS…

18:25.833 --> 18:27.333
Even day-to-day work is fine.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.916
At this rate,
I won't be able to pay this month's rent.

18:31.416 --> 18:35.416
You're well educated,
so I'd really like to hire you,

18:36.416 --> 18:38.083
but we just don't have any openings now.

18:38.166 --> 18:43.500
At any rate, register with us,
and we'll contact you again later.

18:44.708 --> 18:45.833
Okay.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.958
Hello?

18:55.041 --> 18:55.916
<i>Hi.</i>

18:57.791 --> 18:58.750
What is it?

18:58.833 --> 19:01.833
I texted you before,
asking if you were all right.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.916
<i>You didn't answer, so I was worried.</i>

19:07.125 --> 19:08.041
Where are you now?

19:08.833 --> 19:09.708
What?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.791
I'm at home.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.875
Can I come over now?

19:14.375 --> 19:15.333
<i>What?</i>

19:15.833 --> 19:17.500
<i>Seriously? To my place?</i>

19:18.041 --> 19:18.875
Yes.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.083
The time seems right.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.750
<i>Well,</i>

19:24.458 --> 19:25.958
the place is tiny.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.875
<i>-It's a mess too.</i>
-Text me your address.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.500
<i>It really is tiny--</i>

19:35.208 --> 19:36.583
Seriously?

19:37.666 --> 19:38.541
<i>Yes.</i>

19:39.083 --> 19:40.625
All right.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.583
I see.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.500
Thank you.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.708
How did it go with the TV stations?

19:51.875 --> 19:54.125
No luck. Nobody will meet with us.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.125
You must be kidding.

19:57.666 --> 19:59.583
Look how much attention
it's getting online.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.458
It was considered at the production level,
but the higher-ups nixed it.

20:04.541 --> 20:05.375
Unbelievable.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.541
There's something fishy about this.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.166
There's probably some
intense pressure coming from somewhere.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.125
Currently, we have no options.

20:29.416 --> 20:32.708
That's sick. With a girl this young?

20:33.541 --> 20:35.458
This geezer is a real creep.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.375
Where's Mr. Tada?

20:40.958 --> 20:43.875
He's handling something else,
so he'll be a little late.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.375
I see.

20:46.916 --> 20:50.083
You know, I think
the Olympics will be postponed.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.458
After all our hard work too.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.375
I know I touted the success
of performance in politics,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.000
but it's no match for a little virus.

20:59.833 --> 21:02.333
Humans sure are fragile beings.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.208
I wouldn't be so sure.

21:10.666 --> 21:11.541
What?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.250
Do you really hate me that much?

21:15.791 --> 21:18.958
I know you want to blame me
for what happened to Matsuda,

21:19.458 --> 21:20.916
but you're completely wrong.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.291
Mr. Toyoda.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.250
What?

21:24.416 --> 21:25.875
Is it true that

21:25.958 --> 21:29.416
Kohei Matsuda filed a whistleblower
complaint about AI subsidies?

21:34.958 --> 21:37.166
-Who told you that?
-I can't say.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.041
He lost his mind
and suddenly became reckless.

21:43.666 --> 21:47.500
How can there be fraud involved
with a technology yet to be developed?

21:47.583 --> 21:49.666
It simply needs to be made a reality.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.375
Like with Eishin,

21:51.958 --> 21:54.541
as long as those at the top
get what they want, that's good enough.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.416
That's ridiculous.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.041
What?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.375
You know how many
people at the bottom suffer

22:04.458 --> 22:05.666
from decisions made at the top?

22:06.333 --> 22:07.458
-Do you?
-What's got into you?

22:07.541 --> 22:12.333
You have no idea how miserable it is
living filled with a sense of guilt!

22:12.416 --> 22:14.208
-Murakami!
-Answer me!

22:14.291 --> 22:17.000
-You don't get it, do you?
-Murakami! Calm down!

22:17.833 --> 22:19.291
Everything is being recorded.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.458
Mr. Toyoda, I'm sorry about this.

22:28.416 --> 22:29.541
Apologize.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.458
I'm sorry.

22:50.541 --> 22:51.833
I'll have you know that

22:53.625 --> 22:57.833
Matsuda withdrew
the whistleblower complaint himself.

23:00.791 --> 23:02.500
Thanks to his recklessness,

23:02.583 --> 23:04.833
tens of thousands of employees
and their families

23:04.916 --> 23:06.916
would have been hurt,
so it was only natural.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.583
Mr. Murakami,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.708
you need to consider this very carefully.

23:14.916 --> 23:19.583
Just whose mess
do you think I'm cleaning up here?

23:25.000 --> 23:25.958
Go home for today.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.375
Why are you so fidgety?

23:51.458 --> 23:53.125
I can't help it.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.416
You're the first woman here since my mom.

23:58.041 --> 23:58.916
That's hilarious.

24:00.583 --> 24:01.500
Oh, shut up.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.666
-So…
-Yes?

24:06.750 --> 24:07.833
Did something happen?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
No, not really.

24:13.833 --> 24:15.166
Oh, okay.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.250
My job offer was canceled.

24:32.416 --> 24:33.250
Seriously?

24:36.541 --> 24:37.666
Seriously.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.083
All my hard work as a student
went right down the toilet.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.833
Say something, would you?

24:55.416 --> 24:56.291
I…

24:59.458 --> 25:01.000
But that's ridiculous.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.916
You should complain.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.458
I did. I complained right to their face,

25:05.541 --> 25:06.750
but it was no good.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.625
The company itself might even go under.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.375
Ryo…

25:22.625 --> 25:24.916
you should be a good journalist, okay?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Forget about me.

25:27.083 --> 25:30.791
No. I need you to become famous.

25:35.916 --> 25:37.041
You see,

25:38.541 --> 25:43.500
I want to brag that I was the one
who taught you how to read the newspaper.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.916
Don't be like that!

26:02.000 --> 26:04.041
What are you getting depressed for?

26:06.541 --> 26:08.958
I came over here for some encouragement.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.000
Right.

26:14.666 --> 26:15.500
Fine.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.208
I know. I'll cheer you up.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.166
-Let's drink.
-Yes.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.875
Thank you.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.458
<i>I delivered papers around here.</i>

26:29.541 --> 26:31.041
What memories.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.041
Yes.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.000
Right.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.375
Say, Ryo.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.041
Yes?

26:41.541 --> 26:44.333
I've been thinking.

26:46.541 --> 26:49.750
I thought about
why my job offer got canceled

26:50.958 --> 26:53.208
and who I should blame for it.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.958
But it's nobody's fault.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.916
It's absurd, isn't it?

27:01.125 --> 27:03.125
It's like, "This isn't
what I was promised!"

27:08.625 --> 27:12.833
But there is one thing that I figured out.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.791
There is?

27:17.750 --> 27:19.250
In this world,

27:21.041 --> 27:23.125
absolutely anything can happen.

27:26.541 --> 27:27.541
So,

27:28.500 --> 27:32.458
I'm going to make the most
of what's happening in my life right now.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.833
I'm going to live my life
facing up to whatever comes my way.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.958
I feel that way deep down.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.166
I see.

27:52.375 --> 27:56.166
I read the article about your uncle
and the Eishin affair.

27:57.583 --> 27:58.416
Good.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.458
Have you gotten over it, Ryo?

28:04.625 --> 28:05.666
I'm not so sure.

28:06.666 --> 28:08.833
There's still a lot that's unknown.

28:10.208 --> 28:11.041
I see.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.333
Yes.

28:14.708 --> 28:19.416
Face up to everything you encounter
and don't try to run, Mr. Journalist.

28:22.833 --> 28:23.666
I will.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.208
Mayu!

28:50.041 --> 28:52.250
Can I write an article about you?

28:54.541 --> 28:55.416
What?

28:56.416 --> 28:57.583
I mean,

28:58.750 --> 29:02.250
I'm not sure I can write anything good,

29:03.625 --> 29:06.250
but I want people to know
what you've gone through.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.583
I'll think it over.

KAZUYA SUZUKI, ALTERATION, SUICIDE

30:32.500 --> 30:35.083
<i>After a conference call</i>
<i>with the president of the IOC,</i>

30:35.166 --> 30:37.916
<i>he confirmed that they agreed</i>
<i>to postpone the Tokyo Olympics</i>

30:38.000 --> 30:41.875
<i>in the face of the spread of</i>
<i>the novel coronavirus around the world.</i>

30:41.958 --> 30:44.666
<i>He stated that</i>
<i>the postponement would be for one year</i>

30:44.750 --> 30:46.833
<i>and reiterated</i>
<i>that they would not be canceled.</i>

30:46.916 --> 30:48.291
Postponed?

30:49.291 --> 30:53.125
But, you know,
this really is a fortunate tragedy

30:53.666 --> 30:55.916
that will put the Eishin affair to rest.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.458
Precisely.

30:59.083 --> 31:02.541
The coronavirus has served its purpose
by extinguishing the Eishin scandal.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.583
We should take advantage of this crisis

31:05.666 --> 31:08.250
to improve the image
of this administration.

31:09.875 --> 31:10.750
I'll be going now.

31:12.750 --> 31:13.833
Goodbye.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.000
<i>We just got word from upstairs.</i>

31:20.083 --> 31:22.416
For the chief cabinet secretary's
press briefings from April,

31:22.916 --> 31:25.458
only one reporter will be allowed in
from each newspaper.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.125
Really?

31:28.291 --> 31:31.041
They're taking advantage of
the coronavirus to pull all kinds of crap.

31:31.708 --> 31:34.291
I know how you feel,
but we're in a state of emergency.

31:34.375 --> 31:38.125
You need to realize that you won't
be able to do things the way you used to.

31:38.916 --> 31:39.916
Understand?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.416
-Okay.
-Okay.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.375
Ms. Matsuda. Good afternoon.

31:53.041 --> 31:53.875
Hello.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.125
How's the training going?

31:57.208 --> 31:59.791
Not bad. But I'm only doing grunt work.

32:03.375 --> 32:04.208
What is it?

32:06.958 --> 32:10.208
I have a favor
I'd like to ask you, Ms. Matsuda.

32:10.791 --> 32:11.791
You do?

32:13.375 --> 32:16.083
I understand that it's not my place
to do this kind of thing,

32:17.416 --> 32:20.583
but there's an article
that I'm eager to write.

32:21.791 --> 32:23.750
I know I can't do it alone,

32:25.125 --> 32:27.250
so I'd appreciate it if you could help me.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.083
Of course, I'd love to.

32:32.666 --> 32:33.666
Really?

32:34.500 --> 32:35.583
Thank you.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.166
Ryo.

32:40.041 --> 32:40.958
Yes?

32:42.958 --> 32:45.958
I also have a favor to ask you.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.083
Okay.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.166
If you don't want to, feel free to say no.

32:57.833 --> 33:00.041
-Mommy!
-Hi!

33:00.125 --> 33:02.666
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

33:02.750 --> 33:03.625
Yay!

33:04.125 --> 33:05.541
Watch!

33:05.625 --> 33:06.916
-Okay.
-Go ahead!

33:09.125 --> 33:10.416
You did it!

33:10.916 --> 33:12.083
Hayato.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.083
Look at your face!

33:16.916 --> 33:17.833
This?

33:19.333 --> 33:21.916
It's so fast, isn't it? Which one's next?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.041
This one!

33:23.125 --> 33:24.375
This one over here!

33:28.750 --> 33:31.333
-Hurry up!
-Hayato, Natsuki, you're here.

33:58.208 --> 34:00.125
Thank you for coming here.

34:01.250 --> 34:04.083
So who is it you want me to meet?

34:04.958 --> 34:05.833
This way.

34:17.125 --> 34:18.416
It's nice to meet you.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.500
My name is Ryo Kinoshita.

34:26.458 --> 34:29.500
He's a new employee at my paper
who started this year.

34:31.583 --> 34:35.666
What does a new employee
want to do with me?

34:38.208 --> 34:39.083
I…

34:41.666 --> 34:43.916
I am the nephew of the man who died…

34:46.583 --> 34:47.458
Kazuya Suzuki.

34:53.166 --> 34:54.333
Mr. Murakami.

34:55.750 --> 34:59.583
I've come to you today
with one final request.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.083
-Sorry. I'm leaving.
-Wait! Please!

35:10.166 --> 35:11.833
-I just want a moment.
-No! Wait!

35:13.500 --> 35:15.625
I'm not here to blame you.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.041
Please.

35:45.416 --> 35:49.000
Since my uncle died,

35:52.208 --> 35:53.958
I've thought about a lot of things.

35:57.916 --> 35:59.291
Like who to blame…

36:01.458 --> 36:02.875
and whose fault it was.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.666
To be honest, I don't care anymore.

36:13.166 --> 36:14.250
Because to me,

36:16.625 --> 36:20.958
my uncle will always be
someone I respect very much.

36:25.625 --> 36:26.708
Mr. Murakami.

36:28.750 --> 36:29.833
Yes?

36:31.166 --> 36:32.500
Why did you become…

36:34.500 --> 36:35.958
a bureaucrat?

36:45.708 --> 36:48.000
"Why"?

36:48.833 --> 36:49.916
I mean,

36:51.416 --> 36:56.541
I doubt anyone would become a bureaucrat
so they could do bad things.

37:05.583 --> 37:08.500
I've forgotten why.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.333
I'm sure you remember why.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.708
I'm sure you, too…

37:18.916 --> 37:21.958
have thought that things
weren't supposed to be like this.

37:43.916 --> 37:45.500
I am very sorry.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.625
I have…

37:49.750 --> 37:51.083
nothing to tell you.

38:00.458 --> 38:01.541
Will you…

38:04.291 --> 38:05.625
change things with me?

38:11.708 --> 38:12.833
We can do it together.

38:19.291 --> 38:20.500
Something

38:22.208 --> 38:23.250
has to change.

38:46.625 --> 38:47.750
Goodbye.

38:49.541 --> 38:50.541
Goodbye.

39:16.416 --> 39:17.500
Welcome back.

39:18.916 --> 39:19.958
Thanks.

39:21.541 --> 39:23.875
They insisted on staying up
to wait for you.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.375
Figures.

39:31.750 --> 39:32.958
Did it go all right?

39:35.916 --> 39:37.000
Yes.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.958
Want something to drink?

39:47.458 --> 39:49.458
I think I'll have some coffee.

39:49.541 --> 39:50.833
Sure thing.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.291
Say, Yukiko.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.250
Yes?

40:28.458 --> 40:31.500
What would you do if I quit my job?

40:37.083 --> 40:38.083
Well, let's see.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.500
We could open a bento lunch shop together.

40:49.375 --> 40:51.541
Why a bento lunch shop?

40:53.041 --> 40:56.208
I don't know, but it seems like fun.

40:57.833 --> 41:01.958
We could have Hayato and Natsuki help us.
It would be the four of us.

41:09.458 --> 41:11.208
Nice. I like it.

41:17.708 --> 41:19.791
You haven't laughed
like that in a while, Shin.

41:25.208 --> 41:26.958
Remember what you used to always say?

41:29.083 --> 41:30.166
"I work for

41:31.875 --> 41:33.375
the citizens of Japan."

41:35.041 --> 41:40.041
"So I will be a bureaucrat
who works for the helpless."

41:46.791 --> 41:49.833
But you seem like
you've been under a lot of stress lately.

41:53.375 --> 41:55.791
You try to hide it,
but it's so totally obvious.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.458
If the four of us,

42:06.208 --> 42:08.500
Hayato, Natsuki,

42:09.458 --> 42:10.625
you, and I…

42:13.958 --> 42:15.750
can live a tranquil life together,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.375
that would make me happiest of all.

42:29.833 --> 42:30.875
Shin…

42:32.916 --> 42:34.375
I want you to live life…

42:36.958 --> 42:38.250
the way that suits you best.

43:16.666 --> 43:17.500
Yes.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.000
You're right.

43:22.000 --> 43:22.958
I think…

43:26.625 --> 43:28.583
I'll start over living life my way.

43:40.125 --> 43:41.000
Thank you.

43:53.416 --> 43:54.791
Good morning.

43:55.458 --> 43:57.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

43:57.083 --> 43:58.250
-Good morning.
-Morning.

44:00.500 --> 44:03.458
Ms. Matsuda, the trial
will be starting soon, won't it?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.125
Yes. Starting next week.

44:06.208 --> 44:07.583
Do you think you'll win?

44:08.916 --> 44:10.916
We're still the underdogs,

44:11.791 --> 44:14.583
but the chances aren't zero though.

44:14.666 --> 44:17.833
I believe you'll win for sure.

44:18.750 --> 44:19.625
Thank you.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.625
Matsuda.

44:22.416 --> 44:23.625
I read your e-mail.

44:24.416 --> 44:25.250
Is this true?

44:26.916 --> 44:30.291
I've independently confirmed it.
I can go ahead with this, right?

44:30.875 --> 44:32.041
Of course.

44:34.250 --> 44:35.166
Nice work.

44:45.375 --> 44:48.250

SHINPO AGENCY EMPLOYEE
KOHEI MATSUDA

45:00.041 --> 45:01.708
So professional.

45:02.458 --> 45:03.541
Don't make fun of me.

45:04.666 --> 45:05.708
I'll start now.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.208
Go ahead.

45:09.125 --> 45:10.291
Okay, it's recording.

45:11.833 --> 45:12.875
Let's see.

45:13.708 --> 45:16.208
Start by giving your name, please.

45:17.041 --> 45:18.500
I am Mayu Yokokawa.

45:19.458 --> 45:22.958
Let's see. So I'd like to ask you

45:24.750 --> 45:28.583
how you felt
when your job offer was canceled.

45:34.666 --> 45:36.083
<i>…yet to be developed?</i>

45:36.166 --> 45:38.041
<i>It simply needs to be made a reality.</i>

45:38.541 --> 45:40.416
<i>Like with Eishin,</i>

45:41.166 --> 45:44.791
<i>as long as those at the top</i>
<i>get what they want, that's good enough.</i>

45:47.708 --> 45:49.125
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

45:50.083 --> 45:51.041
<i>What?</i>

45:51.916 --> 45:54.500
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>how many people at the bottom suffer</i>

45:54.583 --> 45:56.833
<i>from decisions made at the top?</i>

45:56.916 --> 46:01.833
<i>You have no idea how miserable it is</i>
<i>living filled with a sense of guilt!</i>

46:01.916 --> 46:03.541
<i>-Murakami!</i>
<i>-Answer me!</i>

46:03.625 --> 46:05.166
<i>-You don't get it, do you?</i>
<i>-Murakami!</i>

46:06.375 --> 46:07.333
I think…

46:10.083 --> 46:12.708
there are probably a lot of people
who've gone through

46:12.791 --> 46:14.416
the same experience I have.

46:17.125 --> 46:19.375
I know those companies aren't at fault.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.458
But I would like there to be more programs
to provide support to people like me.

<i>In 10 or 20 years,</i>

46:44.333 --> 46:46.666
<i>when we're even more grown-up,</i>

46:48.416 --> 46:50.916
<i>I wonder what it is that we can do</i>

46:51.708 --> 46:55.583

Hello?

<i>People say that we, young people,</i>

48:02.583 --> 48:06.416
<i>despise politics</i>
<i>and are apathetic toward it.</i>

48:07.166 --> 48:09.958
<i>But I don't think we're like this</i>
<i>because we want to be.</i>

48:13.083 --> 48:14.333
<i>What can we do</i>

48:14.875 --> 48:18.000

48:19.625 --> 48:20.750
<i>The press</i>

Hayato, get up.

49:51.333 --> 49:54.125
Mr. Toyoda, is the story about
fraudulent AI subsidies true?

49:54.208 --> 49:57.583
Please comment on the voice recordings
and internal documents!

49:57.666 --> 49:59.500
Was there collusion by the PM?

49:59.583 --> 50:02.875
What do you think about the police
re-opening the investigation?

50:02.958 --> 50:04.916
-Mr. Toyoda!
-Mr. Toyoda! Please answer!

SUZUKI FAMILY GRAVE

50:38.791 --> 50:40.833
What did you talk to Kazuya about?

50:44.583 --> 50:46.250
I asked him to watch over me

50:46.916 --> 50:49.416
and help me become
a successful newspaper journalist.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.041
That depends entirely on you.

50:52.125 --> 50:54.666
Oh, cut that out. I know that.

50:56.375 --> 50:57.541
You should do your best, okay?

51:00.375 --> 51:01.458
Okay.

51:05.083 --> 51:06.208
It's about time to go.

51:07.541 --> 51:10.000
<i>We might be able to get</i>
<i>Shinichi Murakami to testify.</i>

51:10.583 --> 51:12.208
That would be our strongest evidence.

51:13.041 --> 51:14.666
You sure as heck are persistent.

51:16.375 --> 51:17.333
Boss.

51:18.458 --> 51:21.708
Please remember
what the purpose of our work is.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.625
I'll try to get
the higher-ups to support it.

51:28.333 --> 51:29.166
What?

51:30.666 --> 51:32.125
I'm a public prosecutor too.

Thank you for all you've done, Ryo.

52:32.083 --> 52:33.791
That's what I should be saying to you.

52:40.333 --> 52:42.083
I wonder how it will go.

52:44.541 --> 52:45.916
I don't know,

52:47.541 --> 52:49.250

53:47.125 --> 53:48.375
This is where it begins.

54:15.250 --> 54:17.458
We should be going too.
