<i>NARRATOR: Kids, when you're
in your 2os dating is great,</i>

00:04.540 --> 00:07.029
<i>but by the time you reach your
3os, you find out pretty fast</i>

00:07.051 --> 00:08.512
<i>everyone has baggage.</i>

00:08.513 --> 00:10.390
<i>Sure, you can stick
to the small talk</i>

00:10.510 --> 00:12.950
<i>and pretend it's not there,
but sooner or later...</i>

00:12.951 --> 00:14.084
(phone rings)

00:14.085 --> 00:15.252
It's my ex.

00:15.253 --> 00:17.390
Sorry. We're trying
to remain friends.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.156
Hi, pumpkin!

00:19.276 --> 00:21.759
Did you get our
tickets to Maui?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.560
(chuckles)

00:23.680 --> 00:25.363
<i>Yeah, it's there.</i>

00:25.483 --> 00:35.071

00:40.006 --> 00:42.828
That spring I just started dating
a girl named Royce.

00:42.948 --> 00:44.750
<i>She was smart, beautiful...</i>

00:44.870 --> 00:46.550
Blah-blah-blah,
we're very happy together.

00:46.670 --> 00:47.295
But...

00:47.308 --> 00:49.408
Exactly.
That's the problem.

00:49.528 --> 00:50.492
Her butt?

00:50.493 --> 00:51.826
What is it, too much?
Too little?

00:51.827 --> 00:54.462
Or is it an issue of access?
(laughs)

00:54.463 --> 00:57.665
No, the "but" is, there's
always gonna be a "but."

00:57.666 --> 00:59.234
No matter how great things
are going,

00:59.235 --> 01:01.069
sooner or later,
it's gonna get ruined.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.770
When she turns 30.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.105
When I find out
what her baggage is.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.408
It's there.
I don't know what it is,

01:07.409 --> 01:09.620
but when I do, party's over.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.479
Whoa. Ted,
please tell me

01:11.480 --> 01:14.582
you are not impugning
emotional baggage.

01:14.583 --> 01:15.884
Baggage is a good thing?

01:15.885 --> 01:18.019
Emotional baggage
is the bedrock

01:18.020 --> 01:21.489
of America's most important
cultural export.

01:21.490 --> 01:22.657
ALL:
Porn.

01:22.658 --> 01:25.493
Actually, it's porn.

01:26.228 --> 01:28.163
Only women with major baggage

01:28.164 --> 01:29.697
go into porn.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.599
TED & ROBIN:
Major Baggage.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.800
Ted, everyone has baggage.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.469
You just got to look past it.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.572
Really? 'Cause the last time
I looked past a girl's baggage,

01:37.573 --> 01:40.208
that baggage belonged
to a girl named Stella,

01:40.209 --> 01:41.976
and, oh, I'm drawing
a blank here.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.245
How did that work out again?

01:44.246 --> 01:46.814
<i>Here's how it worked out.
Marry me.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.316
<i>I asked her to marry me.
She said yes.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:50.285
<i>We were happy. But then the day
of the wedding,</i>

01:50.286 --> 01:51.819
<i>her karate instructor</i>

01:51.820 --> 01:53.888
<i>ex-boyfriend Tony Grafanello
showed up,</i>

01:53.889 --> 01:55.523
<i>declared his love for her,</i>

01:55.524 --> 01:57.525
<i>and Stella ran off with him
to California,</i>

01:57.526 --> 02:00.328
<i>leaving me utterly and
completely heartbroken.</i>

02:00.329 --> 02:01.462
Ted, look,

02:01.463 --> 02:03.231
what happened with
Stella was awful,

02:03.232 --> 02:04.465
but that doesn't mean

02:04.466 --> 02:06.301
anyone with baggage
is undateable.

02:06.302 --> 02:08.235
Well, I'm just glad
that we met young enough

02:08.237 --> 02:09.503
that I don't have any baggage.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.939
Mother issues.
I do not.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.707
Grandmother issues.
Definitely do not.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.810
Great-grandmother issues.
I just don't like it when she picks me up.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.579
And you know what
your biggest baggage is?

02:17.580 --> 02:18.880
You're too nice.

02:18.881 --> 02:20.782
How is being nice baggage?

02:20.783 --> 02:23.318
Have you ever seen you
walk down the street?

02:23.319 --> 02:25.720
I don't even know
how to answer hat.

02:25.721 --> 02:26.988
Well, let me help you out.

02:26.989 --> 02:29.490
Michael!

02:29.491 --> 02:32.126
(Spanish accent):
Javier, Marcello!

02:32.127 --> 02:33.494
Susanne.

02:33.495 --> 02:37.732
Hey, Deng, let me
help you with that.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.601
That ought to do it.

02:39.602 --> 02:42.303
Oh, guys, no.
I could not today.

02:42.304 --> 02:44.205
It would just be...

02:51.780 --> 02:53.348
That's normal.

02:53.349 --> 02:55.850
There is only one street
where that is normal.

02:55.851 --> 02:56.851
Here's a hint:

02:56.852 --> 02:59.754
A giant yellow bird
lives on it.

03:00.456 --> 03:01.990
Well, I'll be pretty happy

03:01.991 --> 03:04.125
if Royce's only baggage is
that she's too nice.

03:04.126 --> 03:06.694
Too nice?
That is the worst kind of baggage.

03:06.695 --> 03:09.030
Best baggage:
Hates her dad

03:09.031 --> 03:11.633
and thinks she's
fat, but isn't.

03:11.634 --> 03:13.034
Angry sex on the first date,

03:13.035 --> 03:15.236
and then as soon as
you mention breakfast,

03:15.237 --> 03:16.504
she's gone.

03:16.505 --> 03:18.439
Why do guys hang out with me?

03:18.440 --> 03:20.375
<i>TED: That night on
my date with Royce,</i>

03:20.376 --> 03:23.311
<i>I kept waiting to see
what her baggage would be.</i>

03:23.312 --> 03:25.980
So, is spaghetti
your specialty?

03:25.981 --> 03:28.950
Uh, no. The main event
is my pancakes.

03:28.951 --> 03:31.886
I'll make 'em for you sometime.
They are insane.

03:31.887 --> 03:34.422
My dad used to make
multigrain pancakes.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.758
He's the one who got
me working in porn.

03:39.795 --> 03:40.995
You know PORN?

03:40.996 --> 03:42.563
"Parents Offering
Recognition and Nutrition"?

03:42.564 --> 03:44.599
It's a charity
for inner-city teens

03:44.600 --> 03:46.601
who don't have access to
sports or healthy food.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.736
(sighs) (chuckles)

03:48.737 --> 03:50.772
That reminds me...
(giggles)

03:50.773 --> 03:52.640
I killed my brother...

03:54.243 --> 03:56.878
With this joke
I told him last night.

03:58.013 --> 04:01.234
A barber, a stripper
and a Jew...

04:04.353 --> 04:08.923
...lliard-trained violinist
walk into a bar.

04:08.924 --> 04:11.292
<i>I looked and looked and looked,
but it really appeared</i>

04:11.293 --> 04:13.995
<i>as though there was no baggage
to worry about...</i>

04:13.996 --> 04:18.166
<i>until we went
to go see a movie.</i>

04:18.166 --> 04:20.435
â™ª â™ª

04:27.375 --> 04:28.843
Oh, no.

04:28.844 --> 04:30.878
Hey, what took you guys so long?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.480
Nothing.
Forget about it.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.682
We were on our way here,

04:34.683 --> 04:35.817
and Marshall wanted

04:35.818 --> 04:39.087
to stop and help some guys load
their moving van.

04:39.088 --> 04:40.888
To be nice.
It didn't cost nothing.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.924
D when the moving van
drove away,

04:42.925 --> 04:45.660
who should show up
but the owner of the apartment

04:45.661 --> 04:48.563
we had just helped
some guys rob.

04:48.564 --> 04:52.800
And that one was hard
to explain to the police.

04:52.801 --> 04:53.801
See, Marshall?

04:53.802 --> 04:55.403
This is what I mean.

04:55.404 --> 04:58.539
You can't treat New York City
like it's the small, friendly,

04:58.540 --> 05:00.074
crime-free, inbred, backwoods,

05:00.075 --> 05:03.845
Podunk, cow-tipping, Minnesota
Hickville where you grew up.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.346
Crime-free?

05:05.347 --> 05:06.314
Yeah.

05:06.315 --> 05:08.316
Crime-free? In 1994,

05:08.317 --> 05:12.220
the cashier from the feed store
was held up at hoepoint.

05:12.221 --> 05:13.287
And besides,

05:13.288 --> 05:14.856
I like being friendly, okay?

05:14.857 --> 05:16.557
I'm not gonna change that
about myself.

05:16.558 --> 05:17.759
No, don't change, baby.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.193
I think it's sweet.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.661
Sweet, sweet.

05:20.662 --> 05:22.830
Sweet mother of God,
he's an idiot sometimes.

05:22.831 --> 05:25.733
He actually lent the burglars
gas money.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.835
He gave them money?

05:27.836 --> 05:29.070
Not gave, lent.

05:29.071 --> 05:31.506
They said that they would
send us a check,

05:31.507 --> 05:33.908
so Marshall gave them
our address.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.076
What's to stop them

05:35.077 --> 05:37.011
from coming
to our apartment one night

05:37.012 --> 05:38.579
and maybe tying me up?

05:38.580 --> 05:41.215
I mean, sure,
Marshall and I like to pretend,

05:41.216 --> 05:42.984
but the reality is scary.

05:42.985 --> 05:44.886
Why don't you say something
to him?

05:44.887 --> 05:45.987
What's the point?

05:45.988 --> 05:47.255
<i>(with accent):
He's from Minnesota.</i>

05:47.256 --> 05:49.390
His high school mascot
was a hug.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.392
Hey, guys.
Hey!

05:51.393 --> 05:53.227
How'd the date with Royce go?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.463
It was interesting.
We went to see

05:55.464 --> 05:57.532
<i>that new movie
The Wedding Bride.</i>

05:57.533 --> 05:58.766
Oh, how was it?!

05:58.767 --> 06:01.235
Not that I care.
I mean, that's a chick flick.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.703
This one'll probably drag me
to it,

06:02.704 --> 06:05.473
like, the 7:10 show
tomorrow night or 9:40 because

06:05.474 --> 06:06.474
I have that meeting.

06:06.475 --> 06:08.209
But I can probably get o of it,

06:08.210 --> 06:09.510
so let's try for the 7:10.

06:09.511 --> 06:11.179
ROBIN: What's that
movie about, anyway?

06:11.180 --> 06:13.281
That's the interesting part.

06:13.282 --> 06:14.749
Hey, bonehead,

06:14.750 --> 06:16.584
I'm Jed Mosely!

06:16.585 --> 06:18.252
I'm the most powerful

06:18.253 --> 06:20.121
and corrupt architect
in New York.

06:20.122 --> 06:21.923
I want... (screams)

06:21.924 --> 06:24.792
(all laugh)

06:24.793 --> 06:26.360
It's about me.

06:30.027 --> 06:31.695
<i>The Wedding Bride is about you?</i>

06:32.096 --> 06:33.162
Yeah.

06:33.163 --> 06:34.430
Okay, are you sure
it's about you?

06:34.431 --> 06:35.765
<i>Because when I saw Spaceballs
for the first time,</i>

06:35.766 --> 06:36.733
I could have sworn...

06:36.734 --> 06:39.235
<i>This movie is
about me, Marshall.</i>

06:39.236 --> 06:41.604
It was written
by Tony Grafanello.

06:41.605 --> 06:44.073
Tony Grafanello?
That's the...

06:44.074 --> 06:45.842
Yeah, the guy
that Stella left me for.

06:45.843 --> 06:47.010
This movie is the

06:47.011 --> 06:48.211
whole story of our breakup.

06:48.212 --> 06:50.380
Why would he write
a movie about that?

06:50.381 --> 06:52.248
Isn't he the bad guy
in that story?

06:52.249 --> 06:56.019
Yeah, and the good guy is a guy
named Ted Mosby.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.321
Funny, that was my
memory of it, too.

06:58.322 --> 07:00.590
But according to the movie...

07:00.591 --> 07:03.726
SECRETARY (over intercom): Mr.
Mosley, your fiancÃ© is here.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.229
Great, the old ball and chain.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.932
I can't wait to make her move
out of her beautiful house

07:08.933 --> 07:12.235
in New Jersey and come live with
me in an apartment above a bar.

07:12.236 --> 07:13.303
Send her in!

07:13.304 --> 07:15.772
Ah!

07:15.773 --> 07:18.975
Stella, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

07:18.976 --> 07:22.445
We're supposed to taste wedding
cakes this afternoon, remember?

07:22.446 --> 07:23.579
Ouch!

07:23.580 --> 07:27.784
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

07:28.218 --> 07:30.486
Whoa!

07:30.487 --> 07:31.821
(all laughing)

07:31.822 --> 07:34.891
(sighs)

07:34.892 --> 07:35.959
ALL:
Aw...

07:35.960 --> 07:39.128
Well, I am stunned.
Right?

07:39.129 --> 07:41.965
That's what passes for comedy
these days?

07:41.966 --> 07:44.867
"Whoa, I'm falling back
in my chair!

07:44.868 --> 07:46.369
Whoa!" (giggles)

07:46.370 --> 07:48.204
Whoa. I'm really falling back
in my chair.

07:48.205 --> 07:49.238
LILY:
Oh, baby!

07:49.239 --> 07:51.674
MARSHALL:
Okay, that was pretty funny.

07:51.675 --> 07:53.209
What a jerk.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.945
Did he at least get
someone hot to play me?

07:55.946 --> 07:56.846
You're not in it.

07:56.847 --> 07:57.880
(sighs) What a jerk!

07:57.881 --> 07:58.982
No. No, no, no,

07:58.983 --> 08:00.583
Tony's not a jerk.

08:00.584 --> 08:02.785
Not according
to the movie, anyway.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.554
I'm going through
with this wedding.

08:04.555 --> 08:06.356
I'm sorry, Tony.

08:06.357 --> 08:10.526
Stella, your happiness is
the only thing I care about,

08:10.527 --> 08:13.029
except for these underprivileged
children

08:13.030 --> 08:15.164
that I work with for free.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.532
ALL:
Aw...!

08:16.533 --> 08:19.168
I love him.

08:19.169 --> 08:21.070
It's not that easy, Tony.

08:21.071 --> 08:24.007
Jed Mosely may not be
as handsome as you are,

08:24.008 --> 08:25.241
as...

08:25.242 --> 08:26.509
Tall as you are...

08:26.510 --> 08:29.045
<i>I'm taller than that guy.</i>

08:29.046 --> 08:30.747
...and our sex life is terrible.

08:30.748 --> 08:31.881
Once, he even fell asleep

08:31.882 --> 08:33.582
while we were doing it.
I mean...

08:33.583 --> 08:34.717
(hushed):
It was one time.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.119
I was on cold medicine!

08:36.120 --> 08:38.721
What?
Nothing.

08:38.722 --> 08:41.591
<i>This is a terrible movie!</i>

08:41.592 --> 08:43.126
And it got everything wrong!

08:43.126 --> 08:45.028
Re-Remember how I proposed
to Stella?

08:45.029 --> 08:46.696
<i>That spontaneous moment
in the arcade;</i>

08:46.697 --> 08:47.964
<i>I didn't have a ring,</i>

08:47.965 --> 08:50.967
<i>so I gave her a toy I won
from a crane machine?</i>

08:50.968 --> 08:52.368
Oh, that was so sweet.

08:52.369 --> 08:53.403
So romantic.

08:53.404 --> 08:55.505
A little cheesy.

08:55.506 --> 08:58.041
Well, here's how it went
in the movie:

08:58.042 --> 09:02.345
Look, if it'll shut you up,
I guess we can get married.

09:02.346 --> 09:04.680
Aren't you gonna give me a ring?

09:04.681 --> 09:07.784
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

09:07.785 --> 09:10.720
Here, put is on your finger.

09:10.721 --> 09:11.921
Hey!

09:12.823 --> 09:15.258
And remember
the two-minute date?

09:15.259 --> 09:17.360
When I squeezed an entire
romantic evening

09:17.361 --> 09:18.561
<i>into just two minutes</i>

09:18.562 --> 09:20.029
<i>to accommodate
Stella's busy schedule?</i>

09:20.030 --> 09:22.231
Oh, Ted,
you're such a good guy.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.232
That was really nice.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.335
Also a little cheesy.

09:26.336 --> 09:27.904
Well, according to the movie...

09:27.905 --> 09:30.373
What about our big
romantic weekend?

09:30.374 --> 09:33.242
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.344
Alls I got time for is
a two-minute date,

09:35.345 --> 09:38.614
if you know
what I mean. Sex!

09:38.615 --> 09:40.416
Whoa!

09:40.417 --> 09:42.385
(all laughing)

09:42.386 --> 09:44.754
(sighs)

09:44.755 --> 09:46.355
ALL:
Aw...!

09:46.356 --> 09:47.757
Hey, if you know
what you're doing,

09:47.758 --> 09:49.025
two minutes is all you need.

09:49.026 --> 09:50.226
Run tell DAT.

09:51.128 --> 09:54.263
<i>But the worst,
the worst was the ending.</i>

09:54.264 --> 09:56.032
So they're at the wedding...

09:56.033 --> 09:58.668
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely

09:58.669 --> 10:00.837
to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

10:00.838 --> 10:01.838
I...

10:01.839 --> 10:03.439
Whoa-oh! Spoilers!

10:04.274 --> 10:05.875
Is what, is what I would say

10:05.876 --> 10:09.278
if ever plan on seeing
such an awful film!

10:10.047 --> 10:11.547
Continue.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.818
So they're at the wedding...

10:15.819 --> 10:17.019
I...

10:17.020 --> 10:18.354
Stella!

10:18.355 --> 10:19.455
Tony!

10:19.456 --> 10:20.490
Tony?!

10:20.491 --> 10:22.024
Something I need to say.

10:22.025 --> 10:23.092
A long time ago,

10:23.093 --> 10:26.062
I let this beautiful girl
named Stella

10:26.063 --> 10:27.563
get away.

10:27.564 --> 10:28.631
And now she's with

10:28.632 --> 10:31.033
some jerk
who doesn't appreciate

10:31.034 --> 10:34.470
what he has in this
beautiful wedding bride.

10:34.471 --> 10:36.572
ALL:
Aw...!

10:36.573 --> 10:40.009
(hushed):
What is wrong with you people?!

10:40.010 --> 10:41.944
You can't talk to me like that!

10:41.945 --> 10:43.579
I'm Ted Mosely!

10:43.580 --> 10:46.282
Did he say "Ted" that time?
Shh!

10:46.283 --> 10:48.117
Stella, I promised
to make you my wife.

10:48.118 --> 10:52.488
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.

10:52.489 --> 10:57.627
Oh, Tony, all I've wanted
all my life was your love.

10:57.628 --> 11:00.329
Oh, go on, honey, kiss him.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.031
ALL:
Kiss him! Kiss him!

11:02.032 --> 11:05.368
Stella, if you still
truly love me...

11:05.369 --> 11:06.602
CROWD:
Kiss him! Kiss him!

11:06.603 --> 11:10.973
Will you let me make you
my wedding bride?

11:10.974 --> 11:13.042
CROWD:
Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him!

11:13.043 --> 11:16.279
Can-do's-ville, baby doll.

11:19.183 --> 11:20.216
(applause)

11:20.217 --> 11:21.717
No, no, no!

11:21.718 --> 11:22.952
Stop doing that!

11:22.953 --> 11:24.520
Daddy!

11:25.689 --> 11:27.256
(groans)

11:27.257 --> 11:29.458
Take that, Ted Mosby!

11:29.459 --> 11:30.626
(both laughing)

11:30.627 --> 11:31.928
(all laughing)

11:31.929 --> 11:34.730
Okay, he definitely
said it that time.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.138
(audience applauds)

11:43.207 --> 11:45.208
(sighs)

11:45.209 --> 11:48.411
Oh, my God!

11:48.412 --> 11:49.879
That was so good!

11:49.880 --> 11:51.647
I'm laughing, I'm crying.

11:51.648 --> 11:53.716
I... I know
it's all fake,

11:53.717 --> 11:56.919
but didn't those seem
like real characters?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.921
It was just so real!

11:58.922 --> 12:00.923
Hey, how come
you said, "Oh, no"

12:00.924 --> 12:02.425
when the movie started?

12:02.426 --> 12:04.961
<i>NARRATOR: That's when I realized
everyone has baggage...</i>

12:04.962 --> 12:06.462
<i>including me.</i>

12:09.600 --> 12:11.567
Oh, uh, no reason.

12:12.603 --> 12:15.104
Ted, I think you need
to tell Royce the story

12:15.105 --> 12:16.772
of what happened
with you and Stella.

12:16.773 --> 12:19.075
It-it's gonna come out
eventually.

12:19.076 --> 12:21.010
Why? Why does it
even have to?

12:21.011 --> 12:22.745
Well, for starters,

12:22.746 --> 12:24.380
it's now the fifth
highest grossing movie

12:24.381 --> 12:25.481
of all time.

12:25.482 --> 12:27.783
I don't care.
I don't care.

12:27.784 --> 12:29.752
I'm taking this to the grave.

12:29.753 --> 12:31.921
It's a stupid movie anyway!

12:31.922 --> 12:33.256
Sounds terrible.
I would never go

12:33.257 --> 12:35.291
see that film because
I support you and I love you.

12:35.292 --> 12:37.260
<i>NARRATOR: Kids, you know
where this is going.</i>

12:37.261 --> 12:41.297
Well, she's made her choice.

12:41.298 --> 12:43.165
Don't worry.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.667
I won't go to the wedding.

12:44.668 --> 12:45.935
Oh, you'll go all right!

12:45.936 --> 12:49.905
I'm gonna drive you there myself
and make you watch!

12:49.906 --> 12:51.674
(laughs evilly)

12:51.675 --> 12:53.142
Billy, no!

12:53.143 --> 12:54.944
The code.

12:55.879 --> 12:57.813
This is exactly how it happened.

12:57.814 --> 12:59.815
He got every part right.

12:59.816 --> 13:02.084
Even the thing
with the nunchucks.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.520
<i>NARRATOR: So I was resolved
to put The Wedding Bride</i>

13:04.521 --> 13:05.755
<i>as far behind me as possible.</i>

13:05.756 --> 13:07.757
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

13:07.758 --> 13:09.558
<i>Oh, how great was
The Wedding Bride?</i>

13:09.559 --> 13:11.394
Oh! Loved it!
Loved it, loved it, loved it!

13:11.395 --> 13:13.663
We're going to see it again tomorrow.
ROYCE: Oh, can we come?

13:13.664 --> 13:15.531
Ted, you want to see it
again, right?

13:15.532 --> 13:16.532
Yeah, it was good.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.701
"Good"?
Try instant classic!

13:18.702 --> 13:20.870
The only thing wrong
with it--

13:20.871 --> 13:22.471
and I mean, it's such
a minor flaw

13:22.472 --> 13:24.106
in an otherwise
flawless film--

13:24.107 --> 13:26.309
is, I just didn't get
why Stella would even want

13:26.310 --> 13:28.944
to marry a guy like Jed Mosely
in the first place.

13:28.945 --> 13:32.682
I mean, even that guy's
name: Jed Mosely....

13:32.683 --> 13:34.016
Come on, Royce.
You've dated

13:34.017 --> 13:35.751
a few Jed Moselys in your day.

13:35.752 --> 13:37.953
Well, okay, but who hasn't?

13:37.954 --> 13:41.057
He's such a type;
The butterfly tattoo,

13:41.058 --> 13:42.525
the way he pronounces
encyclopedia.

13:42.526 --> 13:43.492
Ugh!

13:43.493 --> 13:44.960
BOTH:
Encyclo-pay-dia.

13:44.961 --> 13:46.962
Totally, totally.
Well, technically,

13:46.963 --> 13:48.631
that is the correct
pronunciation.

13:48.632 --> 13:49.632
I was so, so happy

13:49.633 --> 13:51.567
when that loser got left
at the altar.

13:51.568 --> 13:54.403
And you know why?
Because he had it coming. Mm-hmm.

13:54.404 --> 13:57.106
And the great part is, he is
gonna live a long, sad life,

13:57.107 --> 14:00.242
knowing that he lost
his only chance at happiness.

14:00.243 --> 14:02.178
Oh, and what about when he
got beat up by the goat?!

14:02.179 --> 14:03.446
(laughing) So funny!

14:03.447 --> 14:05.214
RACHEL: What a loser!
Totally.

14:05.215 --> 14:06.682
Totally!

14:06.683 --> 14:08.718
I mean, the guy's
life was shattered

14:08.719 --> 14:10.753
in a very public humiliation.

14:10.754 --> 14:11.800
What a hoot!

14:12.838 --> 14:15.000
It may be years before he can look

14:15.033 --> 14:16.986
certain family members
in the eye again.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.047
He may be so emotionally traumatized,

14:19.102 --> 14:22.256
he never fully loves or trusts
anyone ever again.

14:22.376 --> 14:23.578
It was hysterical!

14:23.645 --> 14:25.265
Move over, Adolf Hitler,

14:25.385 --> 14:27.215
there's a new king
of comedy, right?

14:28.584 --> 14:30.285
Ted, are you okay?

14:30.353 --> 14:33.413
No, I just think you all might be interested
to learn something

14:33.438 --> 14:37.058
about that movie you all love so much.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.242
It sucks...

14:41.530 --> 14:43.831
And you're all stupid
for liking it.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.724
Wow. That was really mean and

14:47.755 --> 14:49.914
I think you owe us an apology.

14:53.191 --> 14:54.765
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll...

14:56.092 --> 14:58.711
No-can-do's-ville...

15:04.091 --> 15:06.652
You said, "No-can-do's-
ville, baby doll"?

15:06.719 --> 15:09.888
You actually used
Jed Mosely's catchphrase?

15:09.989 --> 15:12.157
I know! I was just
so upset that they...

15:13.815 --> 15:15.413
How do you know
that's his catchphrase?

15:15.533 --> 15:18.872
You dragged me into it. I didn't wanna go.
I wanted to see Avatar.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.621
That's it. I'm just gonna move
to some country

15:20.649 --> 15:22.199
<i>where no one's seen
The Wedding Bride.</i>

15:22.300 --> 15:23.600
Good luck, Ted.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.269
That movie is worldwide.
It's huge.

15:25.336 --> 15:26.571
Maybe North Korea?

15:26.672 --> 15:28.773
Nope. I read
that Kim Jong IL said

15:28.841 --> 15:30.442
it's his second favorite movie
of all time.

15:30.510 --> 15:34.233
Right behind a movie of him
riding a horse in slow motion

15:34.353 --> 15:35.883
Sorry, Ted.
You're screwed.

15:36.284 --> 15:39.186
No, Ted, you know what, no,
Ted is not screwed.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.005
Do you guys want to know
why I'm nice to everyone?

15:42.125 --> 15:44.449
It's because I don't care bout baggage.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.701
I mean, most people, they see
another person walking down the street

15:46.736 --> 15:48.250
with that big heavy bag
they're carrying,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.361
and they just walk on by.
But not me.

15:50.429 --> 15:54.332
I look at them and I say,
I say, "Howdy, stranger.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.568
Can I give you a hand
with that?"

15:55.688 --> 15:57.178
And you know who taught me
to be that way?

15:57.803 --> 15:59.292
A guy called Ted Mosby.

15:59.724 --> 16:02.691
A guy who's uncynical and sincere

16:02.908 --> 16:05.196
and believed in things.
And you know what, Ted?

16:05.484 --> 16:07.322
I believe that deep down,

16:07.442 --> 16:08.896
you're still that guy.

16:09.827 --> 16:11.010
<i>I am still that guy.</i>

16:11.130 --> 16:13.190
I think you want to go out there
and get that girl.

16:13.475 --> 16:14.833
I want to get out there and get that girl.

16:14.953 --> 16:17.055
- Because she's the love of your life.
- Because she's...

16:17.389 --> 16:20.065
Oh, well, we're three dates in.
She seems nice.

16:20.091 --> 16:21.463
Because she seems nice!

16:21.510 --> 16:23.517
<i>She does seem nice!</i>

16:23.736 --> 16:25.154
You're right, Marshall.

16:25.394 --> 16:26.631
I gotta go get her.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.450
And I know exactly where she is.

16:32.672 --> 16:35.441
TONY:
The wedding's in 15 minutes.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.842
I'll never make it!

16:36.962 --> 16:38.659
You can do it, Sensei.

16:38.779 --> 16:40.965
Go get love a house round kick.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.431
Right in the heart.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.203
You're right. What am I doing?!

16:46.783 --> 16:48.053
There's still time!

16:50.000 --> 16:56.074

17:06.666 --> 17:08.998
MINISTER:
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely

17:09.117 --> 17:10.932
To be your lawfully wedded husband,

17:12.217 --> 17:13.262
I...

17:16.046 --> 17:17.372
- Royce!
- Stella!

17:17.492 --> 17:18.729
- Ted?!
- Tony?

17:18.969 --> 17:20.555
- Tony?
- Ted?

17:20.675 --> 17:22.050
Barney?

17:23.587 --> 17:24.987
(slurping)

17:25.107 --> 17:26.419
Look, there's something I need to say.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.257
A long time ago,
A long time ago,

17:29.083 --> 17:31.761
I let this beautiful girl Stella
I let a horrible girl named Stella

17:31.787 --> 17:33.401
Break my heart...
Get away...

17:34.306 --> 17:36.083
And now she's with this jerk

17:36.203 --> 17:38.841
who wrote a movie about it
and that movie is called...

17:39.429 --> 17:40.763
<i>The Wedding Bride.</i>

17:41.628 --> 17:44.574
What are you saying?
MOSELY: You can't talk to me like that!

17:44.694 --> 17:46.567
I'm Jed Mosely!
I'm Ted Mosely!

17:46.687 --> 17:51.122
But Royce, this dufus in the red
cowboy boots, this isn't me.

17:51.242 --> 17:53.378
So, just to be clear,
are you saying you that

17:53.498 --> 17:55.949
you don't have a pair of red
cowboy boots in your closet?

17:56.170 --> 17:58.561
- Barney what are you...
- I just wanted...

17:58.681 --> 18:01.200
They're actually more
of a burgundy.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.383
Royce, I promised
Stella, I promised

18:05.428 --> 18:07.020
to make you some pancakes.
To make you my wife.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.099
TED & TONY: And I'd like to
live up to that promise.

18:11.219 --> 18:14.221
STELLA: Ted, all I've wanted all my
life Ted, all I've wanted all week

18:14.341 --> 18:17.640
...was your love.
...was some pancakes.

18:18.601 --> 18:20.150
BARNEY & MINISTER:
Oh, go on, honey, kiss him!

18:20.270 --> 18:21.183
Kiss him.

18:21.303 --> 18:22.762
Kiss him, kiss him,

18:22.882 --> 18:24.599
Um, Uncle Barney didn't say "kiss".

18:24.827 --> 18:28.646
Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him,

18:28.706 --> 18:30.066
<i>Still not saying "kiss."</i>

18:30.186 --> 18:30.919
Kiss him!

18:31.039 --> 18:32.769
<i>Sir, you need to leave, now.</i>

18:32.889 --> 18:35.272
This is outrageous.
<i>Who the kiss are you?</i>

18:35.781 --> 18:37.523
Royce, if you still...

18:37.643 --> 18:38.886
If you still truly love me...

18:39.006 --> 18:40.417
...kind of like me...

18:41.246 --> 18:43.192
...can you let me make you

18:43.522 --> 18:46.441
- My wedding bride?
- Can you let me make you some pancakes?

18:49.312 --> 18:51.583
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.

18:52.309 --> 18:56.378
(lush orchestral music playing,
chanting continues)

18:56.446 --> 18:58.547
(applause)

19:02.260 --> 19:04.483
MOSBY: Daddy! Kiss this!
Kissin' movie's over anyway.

19:04.603 --> 19:07.613
Sir...
Oh. Oops. Oops.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.236
Hey, um...

19:19.101 --> 19:21.215
...that stuff
that happened to me,

19:22.056 --> 19:23.160
it was pretty rough.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.515
I'm, uh, I'm still
getting over it.

19:26.044 --> 19:27.930
Let me help you with that.

19:30.957 --> 19:32.543
And just like that, kids,

19:32.663 --> 19:35.239
My baggage didn't seem quite
so heavy anymore.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.569
<i>You see, everyone's
got some baggage--</i>

19:37.689 --> 19:40.188
<i>it's part of life--
but like anything else,</i>

19:40.308 --> 19:42.451
<i>it's easier when someone
gives you a hand with it.</i>

19:48.287 --> 19:51.350
Wow, it feels so good to have told you
all that stuff about me.

19:51.470 --> 19:53.942
I'm really glad I can open up to you.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.896
Ted, it's not
that big of a deal.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.701
Heck, I've been
left at the altar.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.035
Three times.

20:04.144 --> 20:07.327
The last time was because I blew
all our money on online poker.

20:09.677 --> 20:11.250
That's why I live
with my brother now.

20:11.539 --> 20:15.107
Wait, I... I thought you said
you had a tiny studio apartment.

20:15.818 --> 20:16.748
Just the two of us,

20:16.965 --> 20:18.622
You should see how he hogs the covers.

20:24.142 --> 20:25.715
Yeah, you gotta go.
