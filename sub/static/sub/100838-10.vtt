01:35.011 --> 01:36.805
You live with your grandmother

01:36.888 --> 01:38.556
and your brother becomes a Christian.

[Christopher] <i>Where's Judy?</i>

01:57.742 --> 01:58.576
Um...

01:59.160 --> 02:00.328
Judy's not coming.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.706
She's... not gonna be
in our lives anymore.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.542
Isn't she, like, your best friend?

02:06.334 --> 02:07.418
What? No.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.295
No, not at all.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.047
Barely knew her.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.343
Then why did you let her live with us?

02:16.302 --> 02:20.056
You guys wanna have this chitchat later?

[Judy] <i>Excuse me, rabbi.</i>

02:21.766 --> 02:24.060
I just wanna say
it was such a nice service.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.979
I love that prayer.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.814
It was beautiful.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.357
What did it mean?

02:29.440 --> 02:32.360
That despite losing someone we love,
we still praise God.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.280
Even though God
took away the person we love?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.615
If we want God to forgive us,
we have to forgive Him.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.617
I like that.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.412
It's nice to think of Abe
up in Heaven with God.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.875
That is nice to think of, but...
there is no Heaven.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.961
-Really?
-No Hell either.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.713
Really?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.633
No matter how much bad someone's done
or how many people you've hurt?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.803
Well, in the Jewish faith,
if you've hurt someone,

02:58.887 --> 03:00.346
you've got to try to make amends.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.516
Find a way to compensate
for what you've done wrong.

03:04.976 --> 03:05.935
Thank you.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.729
Shalom.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.148
Henry Theodore Harding,

03:11.107 --> 03:13.318
we now wash away your original sin.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.944
What's original sin?

03:15.737 --> 03:18.865
Basically,
we're all born guilty and sinful.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.535
But then when we get baptized,
it's like we get a do-over.

03:23.077 --> 03:27.832
Then, all you have to do is ask for
forgiveness and you get a clean slate.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.584
Isn't that nice?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.755
[whispers] She's totally
fucking lying to you.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.925
[Wayne] Through baptism,
we are all one in Jesus Christ.

...and of the Holy Spirit.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.568
[Ana] Mrs. Harding. Hi.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.070
Judy Hale killed my husband.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.239
Yeah?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.492
Yeah? What do you mean, "yeah"?

04:03.243 --> 04:07.330
I mean, as of recently, I've been
made aware of her possible involvement.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.374
No, no. No, it is not possible.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.583
It is definite.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.418
She confessed it to me.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.336
Okay.

04:13.878 --> 04:14.712
I...

04:15.129 --> 04:17.048
I feel like you're being
cavalier about this.

04:17.131 --> 04:18.549
I'm not trying to be cavalier.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.135
-Well, then go arrest her.
-It doesn't work that way.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.720
There are much bigger factors involved.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.347
What factors? God!

04:24.430 --> 04:26.391
The way you talk
fucking annoys the shit out of me.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.434
I'm sorry. But I can't.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.894
It involves another investigation.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.480
And until that plays itself out,
my hands are tied with Ms. Hale.

04:32.563 --> 04:36.317
And even then, if she confesses,
it's not enough to warrant an arrest.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.738
She is a murderer and she is
walking around free as a fucking bird.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.198
You have to do something.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.159
Okay, I can get you a restraining order.
That'll take me about 24 hours.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.081
She killed my husband
and then she moved in with me.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.084
A restraining order isn't gonna do it.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.296
Thank you for fucking nothing again.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.840
Mrs. Harding, wait. Mrs. Harding.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.844
For now, try and take comfort
knowing that you have your answer.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.012
Isn't that what you wanted?

05:05.096 --> 05:08.016
You want me to take comfort
in the fact that we live in a world

05:08.099 --> 05:10.768
where everyone knows what the truth is
and there are no consequences?

05:11.352 --> 05:13.229
There will be consequences, I assure you.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.939
Oh, no. I assure you.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.741
Look at us working together again.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.784
[chuckles] Look at us.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.539
You know, I have to say, having Charlie
at my house has been a real godsend.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.416
It's like having Ted back.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.209
Well, yeah. It's just a phase.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.920
Charlie will come home
when he's done being mad at me.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.839
-Well, I'm glad to be able to help.
-Okay.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.258
Be someone you can turn to.
That's what family's for.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.720
You look tired.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.098
Lorna, I just sold two
of these units for you all cash.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.768
What is it gonna take for you
to just lay off?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.896
Well, you didn't sell anything.

05:54.979 --> 05:55.813
What?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.274
Steve Wood pulled his deposit
this morning.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.734
I thought you knew.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.070
-Why?
-I don't know. He's your client.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.946
Oh, shit.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.741
Well, don't dwell. Circulate the trays.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.203
And do one more Swiffer of the bathrooms.
I want that faux marble spotless.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.496
Yup. Of course.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.834
Hi. Would you like one?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.419
-No.
-Okay. Great.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.512
-May I offer you a pinwheel?
-No.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.809
Hi. Would either of you like
to try one of these?

06:32.892 --> 06:33.976
-No.
-Okay.

06:39.857 --> 06:40.733
Hi.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.777
Good afternoon. Would you like a pinwheel?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.070
-[man] No.
-Okay. Good.

-Get the fuck out!

07:15.059 --> 07:17.520
-Let me help you.
-No, don't fucking help me.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.813
-Shh.
-You shh!

-You look really nice.
-Shut up.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.443
-Okay.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.111
How dare you fucking show up here?

07:25.611 --> 07:28.823
I'm working for Lorna
to keep a roof over my kids' heads,

07:28.906 --> 07:30.366
to keep my life together.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.993
A life that you destroyed.

07:32.076 --> 07:32.952
I know.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.954
That's why I'm turning myself in.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.665
I just wanted you to know I'm gonna
ask for the maximum sentence.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.251
It might be the chair
if that's something that they still do,

07:40.334 --> 07:42.462
but the worst punishment of all
is losing you.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.467
Well, I already turned you in.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.597
Yeah. Okay. That's... You should have.
That's right.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.931
-That's right.
-Good for you.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.141
-Shut up.
-Okay.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.687
It doesn't even fucking matter,
because your confession isn't enough.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.567
So you get to go walk free and fuck
with my head as much as you want to.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.027
I don't wanna fuck with your head.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.572
-Then what do you fucking want, Judy?
-I want to just make amends.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.532
I want you to be okay.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.869
You want me to be okay?

08:14.952 --> 08:15.870
Yeah.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.458
You hit my husband and left him to die.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.587
Then you stalk me, you move into my home,

08:25.046 --> 08:27.006
you get my children to trust you.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.509
You are a fucking sociopath.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.844
-I love you.
-I fucking hate you.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.472
Okay.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.766
Stay the fuck away from me.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.936
If there's anything that I can do...

08:40.019 --> 08:42.605
You know what you can do?
You can disappear off the fucking planet.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.609
Okay.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.321
I have Ted's gun in... in my purse.

08:51.906 --> 08:57.370
So, if I see you again
or you go anywhere near my family...

08:58.496 --> 09:01.249
I will shoot you in the fucking head.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.042
Do you understand me?

09:03.417 --> 09:05.586
Yeah... I do.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.089
Get the fuck out
and don't even come near me.
