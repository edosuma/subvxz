09:50.858 --> 09:53.864
- Ah-ha-ha, so your entire
identity is a lie.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.068
Oh, influential grown-ups
of Richardsville,

09:56.102 --> 09:58.272
how your idol has fallen.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.345
- But lying only makes him
more interesting.

10:01.378 --> 10:03.784
- She's right.
Huzzah for Pon-Pon!

10:03.817 --> 10:06.623
all: Huzzah, Huzzah!
- Pon-Pon!

10:06.656 --> 10:09.662
all: Huzzah, huzzah!
- Sorry, boys.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.367
Museum of NASCAR just canceled
the undercover gig.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.238
- But we already bought
those NASCAR suits.

10:14.271 --> 10:16.108
- Well, Greg over there
is on the board,

10:16.142 --> 10:18.079
and he wants to give
the job to Pon-Pon.

10:18.112 --> 10:20.083
- Okay, do we still have
all those other gigs lined up?

10:20.116 --> 10:22.120
- Oop. Oh, boy. Aw, gee.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.093
Aw, yeesh, not anymore.
Sorry, fellas.

10:25.126 --> 10:27.965
Looks like Pon-Pon fever
is highly contagious.

10:27.999 --> 10:33.176
all: Pon-Pon, Pon-Pon,
Pon-Pon, Pon-Pon!

10:33.209 --> 10:35.748
[bowl shatters]

10:35.781 --> 10:38.085
- Aw, jeez.

10:38.119 --> 10:41.760
- I wonder if actual murder
mysteries are this depressing.

10:41.793 --> 10:43.262
- Kendra was right. I'm doomed.

10:43.296 --> 10:46.803
- No, no, just wait
until channel 57

10:46.837 --> 10:49.107
airs their amazing profile
about us.

10:49.141 --> 10:53.684
We'll be back in the grown-up
game before you know it.

10:53.717 --> 10:56.355
Do you have any Mountain Dew
to mix with this weird wine?

10:56.388 --> 10:58.025
It's really not very sweet.

10:58.059 --> 10:59.829
- Fresca--fridge.

10:59.863 --> 11:02.835
- Ah.
I'll be right back, champ.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.939
Oh, and look
on the bright side.

11:04.973 --> 11:06.910
Um, there's no creepy visits

11:06.943 --> 11:09.816
from Motorcycle Car Lady
tonight.

11:09.849 --> 11:11.820
Fresca--fridge.

11:11.853 --> 11:13.790
[dramatic musical sting]

11:13.824 --> 11:15.059
[yells]

11:15.093 --> 11:16.696
[yelling]

11:30.290 --> 11:33.262
