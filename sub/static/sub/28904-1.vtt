You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

56:20.043 --> 56:23.285
- Mr. Fury, I...
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

56:24.590 --> 56:28.128
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

56:29.261 --> 56:30.671
Stark chose you.

56:30.762 --> 56:33.595
He made you an Avenger.

56:33.682 --> 56:35.593
I need that.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.970
The world needs that.

Maybe Stark was wrong.

Hey.

You got to celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

57:22.981 --> 57:23.981
Yeah.

57:25.317 --> 57:27.182
Fury was right.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.734
Tony did a lot for me...

57:29.821 --> 57:31.812
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

57:32.658 --> 57:33.773
Do you?

57:33.867 --> 57:35.858
Yeah. I mean...

57:37.663 --> 57:40.325
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.246
He wanted me to be better than him.

57:42.334 --> 57:45.326
- And Fury wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want?

57:45.879 --> 57:47.995
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

57:50.050 --> 57:52.632
- I don't know.
- What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.461
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip.

57:55.555 --> 57:57.841
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.016
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

58:01.103 --> 58:04.470
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

58:06.233 --> 58:08.315

- Oh.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.402
Shut up, man.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.565
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.

58:12.656 --> 58:13.486
Why not?

58:13.573 --> 58:15.564
Because I have too much

he just trusted me to pick who should.

It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

02:07:44.699 --> 02:07:47.065
I mean, that was all very convincing.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:50.778
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

02:07:50.872 --> 02:07:54.080
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

02:08:03.009 --> 02:08:06.467
And, uh, it was very touching, you know?

02:08:06.554 --> 02:08:08.340
Really, really quite touching.

02:08:08.431 --> 02:08:09.671

- Um...

02:08:09.765 --> 02:08:14.054
And, uh, you know, shortly after that,

02:08:14.145 --> 02:08:17.103
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:19.351
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

02:08:19.442 --> 02:08:20.932
I don't know what to say to that,

02:08:21.027 --> 02:08:22.642
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...
