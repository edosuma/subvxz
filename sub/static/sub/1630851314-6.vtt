WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.220
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.264 --> 00:04.743
I think someone's
getting murdered.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.397
Oh, my God, it's Kyle.
So you're benched until

00:06.441 --> 00:07.572
this handprint disappears.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.226
EDUARDO:
If you want a chance

00:09.270 --> 00:10.793
at solving this mystery,
you need to start

00:10.836 --> 00:13.578
by asking the right questions.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.885
You all right?

00:15.928 --> 00:17.060
Let me heal your heart.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.148
It's the only way to save Liz.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.107
Do it. [groans]

00:20.150 --> 00:22.152
MARIA:
It's not over
till the sky clears up.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.076
Maria, hey!

00:37.341 --> 00:39.169
ALEX:
You never forget
the exact moment

00:39.213 --> 00:41.258
when something
terrible happens.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.477
ROSA:
Like a song stuck in your head,

00:42.520 --> 00:45.393
you replay all the details.

00:46.220 --> 00:49.832
ISOBEL:
Asking yourself
if you could've stopped it.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.531
LIZ:
If you'd only been smarter,
maybe you would've realized

00:53.575 --> 00:55.142
how the pieces fit together.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.579
MICHAEL:
But you didn't, because

00:57.622 --> 00:59.494
every mystery has
one thing in common.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.756
[yelling]

01:00.799 --> 01:03.541
No! No! No! No!

01:03.585 --> 01:05.761
No! [yells]

01:07.067 --> 01:08.242
[clock ticking]

01:08.285 --> 01:11.288
MAX:
Nothing's ever what it seems.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.901
[whooshing]

01:18.861 --> 01:20.167
Careful, kid.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.170
You're manhandling
a Deep State conspiracy.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.303
I, uh, spent some time
on the dark web.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.566
I didn't find anything
about a magic radio.[laughs]

01:28.610 --> 01:32.135
I also looked into this symbol,
and I couldn't find anything.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.791
Have you seen
this marking before?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.882
Do you believe in aliens?

01:40.926 --> 01:42.667
I, uh, believe in statistics.

01:42.711 --> 01:46.628
And I think it's improbable that
we're alone in the universe.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.109
What if I told you,

01:49.152 --> 01:51.894
the question isn't whether
or not they exist,

01:51.937 --> 01:54.940
it's how do we start
a conversation?

01:54.984 --> 01:58.248
Well, I would say,
"Good luck."

01:58.292 --> 02:01.338
'Cause knowing us, if
they decided to show themselves,

02:01.382 --> 02:03.123
we would probably just
kill them.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.994
And that is why
Deep Sky was created.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.343
Because I believe

02:06.387 --> 02:07.779
it doesn't have to be that way.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.739
If we could forge
a... connection

02:10.782 --> 02:13.350
with beings from
another galaxy,

02:13.394 --> 02:15.265
think of what could be possible.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.180
Is there any part of you
that thinks

02:17.224 --> 02:20.792
that aliens might pose a threat
to humanity?

02:21.532 --> 02:27.190
See, I came to Deep Sky
for personal reasons.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.888
Just like you did.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.194
I believe we have the power

02:31.238 --> 02:33.283
to shape the narrative
between our worlds,

02:33.327 --> 02:37.244
and it is up to us to make sure
we do that correctly.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.290
You think this symbol is
the key to doing that?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.902
Maybe.

02:43.946 --> 02:47.950
You asked whether the machine
was built for good or evil.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.126
In my opinion,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.302
there is never a reason

02:52.346 --> 02:54.913
to be afraid of the mysteries
of the universe.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.307
[whooshing]

02:59.091 --> 03:01.181
[thudding]

03:03.444 --> 03:05.185
Stay here.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.282
â™ª

03:20.243 --> 03:23.420
Any news?Looks like a break-in,

03:23.464 --> 03:25.379
but nothing was stolen.
It doesn't make any sense.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.250
Just tell us everything.
Start from the beginning.

03:27.294 --> 03:31.036
When I got to the house,
Maria was unconscious.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.430
So, of course, I rushed over
to check on her.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.823
Then,

03:34.866 --> 03:37.129
some guy
in an alien mask jumped me.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.522
I was able to throw him off,

03:38.566 --> 03:40.872
and he-he went
through the patio doors.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.309
Before I could go after him,

03:42.352 --> 03:44.354
there must have been a second
guy, 'cause I got slammed

03:44.398 --> 03:48.445
into a wall, and that's when
everything started to get foggy.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.360
Did you call the sheriff?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.319
Well, she was already there
when I came to.

03:52.362 --> 03:56.061
Sheriff thinks that
the Regiment wanted to scare me,

03:56.105 --> 03:58.063
and then, Maria was just

03:58.107 --> 03:59.761
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.284
Okay, what about Kyle?

04:01.328 --> 04:04.505
Well, his car's there,
but there's no sign of him.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.159
The sheriff and I are
pulling warrants to search

04:07.203 --> 04:08.857
any known affiliate
of the Regiment.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.293
MICHAEL:
It's obviously them.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.990
Jordan already tried
to kill Kyle once.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.297
Yeah, but it's kind of hard to
commit a crime from behind bars.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.604
So one of his bigoted buddies
did it for him.

04:16.647 --> 04:20.260
Well, if they'd beat him up,
I'd buy it, but kidnapping...

04:20.303 --> 04:21.478
[sighs heavily]

04:21.522 --> 04:25.134
No. Kyle wouldn't run.
Not with Maria injured.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.527
MICHAEL:
Ash is drying up.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.703
The funeral Maria saw
would be any day now.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.096
Kyle is not dead.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.881
In Maria's vision,
she was healthy.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.884
Now she's in a coma,
so I-I guess we know

04:35.927 --> 04:37.320
she can change the future.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.541
The question is how much?

04:40.584 --> 04:41.759
There is one more thing.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.371
When I was driving
to the house,

04:44.414 --> 04:46.329
there was this flash of light

04:46.373 --> 04:48.853
off in the desert.
I didn't tell the sheriff.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.290
'Cause the last
thing we need is

04:50.333 --> 04:51.421
Graham Green on
the case as well.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.423
Okay.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.297
I'll look into the
alien blast in the desert.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.910
[sighs] Okay, so if the Regiment
doesn't have Kyle, who does?

05:01.953 --> 05:03.651
That is an excellent question,

05:03.694 --> 05:06.001
and I am gonna
head back to the house

05:06.044 --> 05:08.830
[phone chimes]to see if I can answer it.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.485
They let Isobel in to see Maria.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.535
ISOBEL:
DeLuca?

05:18.579 --> 05:22.147
Are you in here?

05:27.457 --> 05:30.330
What the hell's going on
with your mind?

05:31.766 --> 05:34.203
[exhales]

05:34.246 --> 05:37.206
Come on, lady, you can't
ghost your own party.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.642
[rumbling][Isobel gasps]

05:40.688 --> 05:44.126
[glass breaking][rumbling increasing]

05:44.169 --> 05:46.433
[gasps]

05:52.787 --> 05:54.832
Hey.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.399
Where's Mimi?

05:56.443 --> 05:58.445
I-I thought you guys
were gonna bring her.I couldn't.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.403
She just-- She's not
herself right now.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.013
I tried explaining
what was happening,

06:02.057 --> 06:04.015
and I don't think she got it,
she just kept yelling,

06:04.059 --> 06:05.843
"The alien will hear her."

06:05.887 --> 06:07.671
That's from A Quiet Place.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.239
It could be a clue.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.023
Or maybe she's just

06:12.067 --> 06:14.635
freaked out that
her daughter's in a coma.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.463
I'm guessing you haven't
found her yet?

06:16.506 --> 06:19.727
Yes and no.
I-I can feel her in there.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.468
I just, I can't reach her.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.339
I don't understand this, Liz.
I don't understand.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.427
How is she in a coma?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.864
I don't know.
I don't know. It, uh...

06:26.908 --> 06:28.605
I mean, it has to be
the neurodegeneration,

06:28.649 --> 06:30.433
but I just, I don't understand
how she's progressed

06:30.477 --> 06:31.739
so much worse than Mimi.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.784
I mean, surely you have
a theory, though.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.307
I mean, isn't this kind of what
you were working on at Genoryx?

06:35.351 --> 06:37.092
If I just had more time...

06:37.135 --> 06:38.485
But we don't have time, Liz.
I mean,

06:38.528 --> 06:40.400
what do you think
we should do?

06:42.924 --> 06:44.447
Find Kyle.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.581
He's the one who's been
monitoring her, not me.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.718
Keep this on her while
you're not in the mindscape.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.328
Rosa, wait.
No.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.460
If anything, at least
it'll keep her brain

06:57.504 --> 06:58.679
from degrading any further.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.985
I mean, if it's all
we can do for her,

07:01.029 --> 07:02.639
at least it's something.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.469
[electricity buzzing]

07:06.513 --> 07:08.776
[breathing unsteadily]

07:08.819 --> 07:10.473
Rosa.

07:17.698 --> 07:20.483
[buzzing stops]

07:20.527 --> 07:22.485
I'm not the girl I was
a year ago.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.445
I'll be fine.ISOBEL:
She's in there somewhere.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.490
I'm gonna find her.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.100
And you find Kyle.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.580
MAX:
It's like he just vanished.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.843
The sheriff's got him in
the missing persons database.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.498
The first 48 hours
are the most critical.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.848
Did you get a dog?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.241
Oh, uh, Jones did.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.243
I guess I'm stuck
with him.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.897
Can't really tell us apart.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.203
He's probably just hungry.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.124
MAX:
This was the only room targeted.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.741
Henry IV, Part 2.
Of all the books.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.615
Last time I was here was

08:05.659 --> 08:09.445
when I took that job at Genoryx.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.275
Oh, yeah.
Sorry that didn't work out.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.889
Let's just figure out
what happened to Kyle.

08:18.933 --> 08:23.372
Okay, so, have you noticed
anything out of the ordinary?

08:23.415 --> 08:24.678
Anything missing?
No.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.418
Like I told you
this morning.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.334
Right, but there has
to be a clue, so,

08:29.378 --> 08:30.640
do you think it's
an alien thing?

08:30.684 --> 08:32.424
Have you checked
for fractal patterns?

08:32.468 --> 08:33.991
Yeah, I checked.
There was none.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.863
But you haven't found anything?

08:35.906 --> 08:38.561
That's why I let you join me
at an active crime scene.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.782
Maybe you can see
something I missed.What?

08:41.825 --> 08:44.175
I haven't been here in a year.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.655
Then why did you
insist on coming?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.048
Because something here
has to point to

08:47.091 --> 08:48.832
why Kyle is missing
and Maria is in a coma.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.791
Right, exactly. So why don't you
just focus on that?

08:50.834 --> 08:53.184
Yes, I am focusing.
I am focusing on

08:53.228 --> 08:54.751
attempting to solve this
together.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.884
So why are you still
pushing me away?

08:59.626 --> 09:04.674
I... I should feed the dog.

09:12.203 --> 09:15.555
Your mother said
the alien would hear you.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.646
Well, I'm here.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.300
The alien.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.607
I've arrived.[rumbling]

09:27.131 --> 09:29.960
Okay. Okay.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.355
So you're going through
a goth phase.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.097
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
You know?

09:36.140 --> 09:38.360
I'm just gonna stay here

09:38.403 --> 09:41.755
at the Overlook Hotel bar

09:41.798 --> 09:44.845
until you decide
you want to talk to me.

09:44.888 --> 09:48.544
I didn't realize "feed the dog"
also meant walk him.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.719
I looked at the house,

09:49.763 --> 09:51.547
and you're right,
there's nothing there.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.505
I don't think the house
is the crime scene.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.420
I think this is.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.597
It was like this
when I got here.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.424
Did you just conveniently
forget to tell us

09:59.468 --> 10:00.774
that you had something
buried in the desert?

10:00.817 --> 10:03.646
Well-- [sighs]
I wasn't sure it was relevant.

10:03.690 --> 10:04.952
Given we're looking
for a motive,

10:04.995 --> 10:06.562
this is absolutely relevant.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.651
Forget motive, but I think
I found your weapon.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.131
You're the only person
I know that can

10:10.174 --> 10:11.654
test blood off-book.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.395
[exhales sharply]

10:13.438 --> 10:14.831
DNA is a path
I know how to follow.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.267
Okay.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.705
All right. All right.[phone ringing]

10:21.185 --> 10:23.013
Hey, Michael. Yeah.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.581
What's up?MICHAEL:
You need to meet me

10:25.625 --> 10:27.714
at the radio tower
by Verna's Vista.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.543
I think I got a lead
on what happened to Valenti.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.465
So, lightning caused the flash
that I saw last night?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.772
No. Skies were clear.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.295
It was this.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.688
Kyle's radio.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.864
In the words
of Great-Grandpa Valenti,

10:47.908 --> 10:49.953
"Let this guide the way."

10:49.997 --> 10:51.694
And it did.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.827
Right into this pole.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.959
I mean, this much damage,

10:56.003 --> 10:59.180
it takes a lot of velocity.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.792
My guess is the glass
inside the radio provided it.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.751
It was wired
to a prehistoric transmitter

11:04.794 --> 11:06.709
Papa Jim tucked
inside of it.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.233
My guess? Valenti used the radio
to call for help,

11:09.277 --> 11:10.713
but it malfunctioned
due to Jim's

11:10.757 --> 11:12.976
primitive understanding
of alien tech.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.022
And it fried every tower
in a 20-mile radius.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.633
Okay, so, then,
why did it hit this one?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.548
It's the closest to Max's house.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.376
And when I heard
Sanders giddy

11:21.419 --> 11:22.725
that pricey
communication equipment

11:22.769 --> 11:24.727
was scattered
throughout the desert

11:24.771 --> 11:27.687
because of an electrical surge,
I started thinking

11:27.730 --> 11:29.950
about the explosion you saw
when you were driving.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.429
Which led me here

11:31.473 --> 11:34.694
to find a splintered
Valenti heirloom and...

11:34.737 --> 11:36.783
suicidal bats.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.829
The surge killed
all these bats?

11:39.873 --> 11:41.483
What do I look like,
a zoologist?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.876
All I'm saying is
there's a good chance

11:42.919 --> 11:46.401
whoever answered the SOS
has Valenti.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.924
Or whoever's blood

11:47.968 --> 11:49.709
is on that shovel has Valenti.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.407
We found a shovel

11:52.450 --> 11:56.890
by a large, empty hole about a
half mile from Max's back door.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.240
A hole?

11:59.283 --> 12:01.851
That's your idea
of safekeeping?

12:01.895 --> 12:02.896
Please don't tell me
that someone

12:02.939 --> 12:04.636
is walking around Roswell
right now

12:04.680 --> 12:06.943
with the off-brand lightsaber.The what?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.426
You didn't tell her.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.341
When we found Jones,

12:13.384 --> 12:14.777
he had a sword

12:14.821 --> 12:16.692
made of alien glass.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.608
The hiding place
shouldn't have been a problem

12:19.651 --> 12:21.784
since I'm the only one
that can touch it.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.091
Are you saying you had
a sword that recognizes DNA?

12:24.134 --> 12:27.355
Burns the crap out of anybody
without this dude's face.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.009
Does this mean
that Jones could be out?

12:29.052 --> 12:30.619
No.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.230
No. First thing I did,
I went to the cave.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.971
He's still there,
safely in stasis.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.887
Okay, so... could they have
lifted it with something?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.193
Maybe.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.673
But they would have to know
what it was.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.850
And where to dig.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.811
[sighs]
This wasn't the Regiment.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.031
I will put
in a request

12:51.074 --> 12:55.078
to look at traffic cams, see if
anyone answered Kyle's call.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.907
Our best bet
is still the science.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.910
If we can figure out
whose blood is on that shovel,

13:00.954 --> 13:03.739
we'll have a good idea
what happened to Kyle.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.916
Can you track the SOS?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.613
The radio signal?

13:08.657 --> 13:11.703
You know it literally travels
in every direction at once?

13:15.664 --> 13:17.840
I'll hit up Alex.

13:17.884 --> 13:21.931
See if we can turn "no way
in hell" into a fighting chance.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.849
[talking quietly]

13:26.893 --> 13:28.242
Hey.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.635
What happened? Do you know
why bats hit the window?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.377
Something messed with
their echolocation.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.770
Did one of them bite you?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.685
Uh, no. No, no, no.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.993
Um, j-just a rabies shot.
To be safe.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.998
The machine did
this, didn't it?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.913
And if this messed with
their radar,

13:46.956 --> 13:48.871
just imagine what else
it could do.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.873
I don't know
what the hell I was thinking.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.354
I-I was just so desperate
for answers...

13:53.397 --> 13:54.746
You are not your father.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.705
You were careful.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.664
Laparoscopic technology
is noninvasive.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
It was a minimal risk

14:01.928 --> 14:05.409
that led to
an unprecedented breakthrough.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.455
Okay, but at what cost?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.631
Do not lose faith
in yourself, Alex.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.938
Not now.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.593
Let me handle the bats.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.204
You stay on the machine.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.596
And then...

14:18.640 --> 14:20.642
we'll figure out
the next steps together.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.035
[phone chimes]

14:27.954 --> 14:30.260
Here you go.
Have an out-of-this-world day.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.089
[lively chatter, rock music
playing over speakers]

14:39.139 --> 14:40.618
Maria.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.794
[electricity buzzing,
water sloshing]

14:47.582 --> 14:50.150
[electricity buzzing, crackling]

14:55.329 --> 14:57.113
[plates clattering
and grease sizzling loudly]

14:57.157 --> 14:58.898
[jukebox clicking loudly]

15:00.987 --> 15:02.336
PETE:
I just don't know, and I--

15:02.379 --> 15:05.165
He's got this way
of making weird things happen.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.688
Ok...
TAYLOR:
I think this is

15:06.731 --> 15:08.211
all in your head, Deputy.COOK: Order up!

15:08.255 --> 15:10.039
TAYLOR:
Need a little help,
I know a great doctor, okay?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.085
I'm sick of the way
you talk about him.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.956
PETE:
Every time Evans is around,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.001
something strange
is going on.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.263
That's all I'm gonna say.

15:16.306 --> 15:17.960
Sounds like it's more like
in your head

15:18.004 --> 15:19.092
something strange
going on.
What?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.963
It wasn't the Regiment.
Evans is slippery.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.443
[high-pitched ringing,
electricity crackling]

15:22.486 --> 15:25.185
[sounds continue loudly]

15:32.540 --> 15:35.108
Talk to me, Goose.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.285
Can you hear me?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.072
[object clatters on floor]

15:43.116 --> 15:45.161
[panting]

15:47.947 --> 15:50.036
Tell me what happened to you.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.516
[gasps]

15:52.560 --> 15:55.128
â™ª

15:55.171 --> 15:55.955
[creaking]

15:58.261 --> 15:59.654
[gasps]

15:59.697 --> 16:01.134
[exhales]

16:04.398 --> 16:06.269
Good. You're back.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.097
I need your help.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.667
God! [shouts in Spanish]

16:12.710 --> 16:14.190
[sighs]

16:14.234 --> 16:15.800
Genoryx, I would've had
a match by now.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.237
Can I help?

16:17.280 --> 16:20.980
Not unless you have
a rapid DNA test in your pocket.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.114
[high-pitched ringing]

16:25.158 --> 16:27.203
[machine beeps, whirring]

16:28.770 --> 16:31.120
Thanks.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.339
[sighs]

16:32.382 --> 16:33.470
I'm sorry

16:33.514 --> 16:35.037
that I...

16:35.081 --> 16:37.213
walked off into the desert
without you.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.173
You should've told me you had
something buried out there.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.175
I know.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.828
Why didn't you?

16:43.872 --> 16:47.049
Well, I don't really know
how to act around you,

16:47.093 --> 16:49.660
um, since yesterday.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.621
Max, putting the handprint on me
was an accident.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.058
And I'm fine.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.060
Yesterday you were honest
with me and today you aren't,

16:58.104 --> 16:59.279
so what has changed?

17:02.238 --> 17:04.458
[electricity buzzing
and zapping]

17:04.501 --> 17:05.763
[machine beeps]

17:05.807 --> 17:07.896
Oh. Oh, God.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.680
[sighs]

17:09.724 --> 17:11.117
Uh, let me...

17:11.160 --> 17:13.293
No, no, no,
it-it's-it's not electrical.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.859
I got to get somebody
out here.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.123
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go
check in with Taylor

17:17.166 --> 17:19.516
and see if there are
any new leads.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.344
Yeah.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.781
[sighs]

17:25.131 --> 17:26.915
I'm sorry to have
pulled you away.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.917
Did you connect with Maria?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.919
No, and it's getting worse.
It's like...

17:30.962 --> 17:33.139
It's not even that
I just can't connect with her.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.836
It's like there's something that
is actively keeping me away.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.316
I don't know.
It's a nightmare.

17:36.359 --> 17:39.188
Well, good.
We can compare nightmares.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.320
Whoa.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.843
[high-pitched ringing,
loud chatter]

17:41.886 --> 17:43.366
[IV dripping
and phone ringing loudly]

17:43.410 --> 17:46.239
The world has gone from regular
to screaming at me.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.893
Have you ever heard a
mosquito flap its wings?

17:48.937 --> 17:49.894
'Cause trust me,
you don't want to.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.374
[sounds continue loudly]

17:51.418 --> 17:53.507
I really need to figure out
a way to get it together.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.725
[panting]:
I can't...

17:54.769 --> 17:55.857
Hey, Rosa? Rosa?Yeah, what?

17:55.900 --> 17:56.858
Hey, look at me, look at me.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.295
Yeah.
Look at me.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.080
Take a deep breath.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.342
[breathes deeply]

18:02.385 --> 18:03.691
Just relax, okay?

18:03.734 --> 18:05.258
[sounds fade]

18:05.301 --> 18:07.173
There.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.914
Listen, alien puberty
is rough.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.264
Your body is changing

18:11.307 --> 18:13.135
in beautiful
and unexpected ways.
No.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.311
And...
Don't Judy Blume
me right now.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.139
Okay, I'm also not even
actually an alien.

18:17.183 --> 18:21.187
Well, you did spend
ten years soaking in a pod,

18:21.230 --> 18:22.840
which lends you a certain

18:22.884 --> 18:25.234
alien je ne sais quoi...

18:25.278 --> 18:27.193
[gasps]

18:27.236 --> 18:28.368
Oh, my God.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.458
"The alien will hear her."

18:31.501 --> 18:35.766
Rosa, I think that Mimi
was talking about you.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.168
I thought "white as a sheet"
was just an expression.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.301
You said this had to do with
Kyle and Maria.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.476
What are we doing here?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
Kyle sent out
a radio transmission

18:51.956 --> 18:53.393
before he disappeared
last night.

18:54.394 --> 18:58.006
I need your help figuring out
if someone received it.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.617
Uh, I-I mean, radios are omni...

19:00.661 --> 19:01.836
Directional, I know.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.318
But the Valenti family radio,
it's a little special.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.233
Hence the suicidal bats.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.539
I mean, honestly,
I feel like

19:09.583 --> 19:11.802
this-this tower, it's,
uh, it's a dead end.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.282
I mean, you have any
other leads or...

19:13.326 --> 19:15.763
Well, what's wrong
with this tower?

19:15.806 --> 19:18.287
If Kyle's radio was an SOS, what
if it transmitted his location?

19:18.331 --> 19:21.116
What if someone
came out here and took Kyle?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.683
What if he was
abducted by aliens?

19:22.726 --> 19:24.075
I mean, you don't
have any proof.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.122
Max found
a bloody shovel nearby.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.212
Hey, did one of them bite you?

19:30.256 --> 19:32.171
Uh, no.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.911
Um, j-just a rabies shot.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.087
Where's the shovel now?

19:36.131 --> 19:37.393
Liz took it.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.182
Look, I'll talk
to you later, okay?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.663
[high-pitched ringing]

19:46.707 --> 19:48.230
I'm not doing this with you.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.579
What are we doing, Alex?

19:50.406 --> 19:53.061
'Cause it sure ain't
investigating a crime scene.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.932
I'm a cyber intelligence
specialist.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.456
I'm not a magician.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.371
Well, I just want you to be
a guy who gives a damn.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.460
When I thought
it was me who was killed

20:00.503 --> 20:04.290
in Maria's vision, you said
you would burn the world down

20:04.333 --> 20:06.205
to find out
who hurt me.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.208
Don't Kyle and Maria
at least deserve a few flames?

20:09.251 --> 20:11.253
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna do anything.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.386
I just don't want you
anywhere near

20:13.429 --> 20:15.170
whatever it is I decide to do.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.089
[engine starts]

20:27.835 --> 20:30.141
[buzzing]

20:31.708 --> 20:33.188
Are you sure this is safe?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.494
What if I break
something?

20:34.537 --> 20:35.799
I don't think
anyone would notice.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.279
[clanging]

20:41.370 --> 20:42.545
I feel her in here.

20:42.589 --> 20:43.764
It's likeshe's...

20:43.807 --> 20:45.156
just underneath
the surface.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.375
Are-are you getting anything?

20:46.419 --> 20:48.290
Besides creeped out?I can feel her, Rosa.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.597
We just have to try to listen.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.381
[exhales][gasps]

20:54.470 --> 20:55.906
Obviously,
that's not working.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.560
Okay, Rosa, well,
you just have to try.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.475
I've never done
this before, okay?

20:59.519 --> 21:01.303
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be hearing.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.395
She's pulling away.
She's getting more distant.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.179
I-I'm having trouble connecting.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.007
Rosa, see if you can think
about Maria.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.358
I'm trying, okay?
Stop stage-momming me.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.141
Okay.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.751
[cacophonous sounds]

21:14.795 --> 21:16.144
[groaning]

21:16.753 --> 21:18.102
[panting]

21:22.716 --> 21:24.805
Are you okay?[gasps]

21:24.848 --> 21:26.676
Rosa.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.288
[door swings shut]

21:30.332 --> 21:32.334
SANDERS:
Eight towers down

21:32.378 --> 21:37.339
and enough junk to bankroll
a year's worth of margaritas.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.776
You still trying
to figure out what fried 'em?

21:39.820 --> 21:41.430
Yeah.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.303
And I'm pretty sure my friend
knows something about it, but...

21:44.346 --> 21:46.348
he won't tell me,
for some reason.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.395
I assume this friend is Alex?

21:50.352 --> 21:52.702
[chuckles]
I ain't blind, kid.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.443
I mean, I am blind,

21:54.487 --> 21:57.577
but even I can see
that you two are a thing.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.100
We're not.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.928
And since he won't tell me,

22:00.971 --> 22:03.365
I have to figure it out myself.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.847
I was supposed to protect Kyle.

22:06.890 --> 22:10.546
And Maria,
who's currently in a damn coma! [high-pitched ringing]

22:21.122 --> 22:22.297
Doesn't make any sense.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.385
But it does.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.692
You're just so busy
beating yourself up

22:25.735 --> 22:29.391
for yesterday you can't focus
on what happened today.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.307
[chuckles softly]
Okay, smart-ass.

22:34.744 --> 22:35.876
[patting]

22:35.919 --> 22:37.399
You tell me what I'm missing.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.532
I'm guessin'...[sniffles] Mm.

22:39.575 --> 22:43.144
...you haven't figured out
what took out the vampire bats.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.189
Vampire bats?

22:45.233 --> 22:46.887
They were the only type
affected.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.410
You didn't think
of that?

22:48.454 --> 22:51.108
Keep talking. What makes
vampire bats different?

22:51.152 --> 22:53.937
They hunt using infrared.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.071
Radio waves travel
in all directions,

22:57.114 --> 22:59.508
but infrared
only travels in one.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.250
Were the bats
at all of the towers?No.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.425
Just three of 'em.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.471
What if the radio signal

23:05.514 --> 23:07.777
masked the real signal,
which is what the bats detected?

23:07.821 --> 23:09.823
And they were only
at these three towers

23:09.866 --> 23:12.303
'cause they were only drawn
to the infrared signal.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.218
And so was the radio.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.438
That's why it crashed
into the tower.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.441
Where did you find the bats?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.665
So these

23:25.708 --> 23:26.796
three towers

23:26.840 --> 23:29.408
transmitted the real signal.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.454
Which sent it here.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.936
If I follow that trail,

23:35.979 --> 23:38.678
I find Kyle.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.637
The only traffic cam
in the vicinity

23:41.681 --> 23:43.073
caught it driving eastbound

23:43.117 --> 23:44.901
at 11:07 p.m.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.077
And the two
guys in front

23:47.121 --> 23:48.992
were wearing
alien masks.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.472
You ran the plates?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.039
Belongs to a Samuel Cook,

23:52.082 --> 23:53.475
proud member of the Regiment.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.085
But he claims that
he never uses it.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.347
So either
he's lying

23:56.391 --> 23:58.437
or...Somebody borrowed it

23:58.480 --> 23:59.612
with the intention to return it

23:59.655 --> 24:01.483
before he even realized
it was gone.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.224
Either way, our
masked crusaders

24:03.267 --> 24:04.312
sure didn't want to ditch it,

24:04.355 --> 24:05.487
but it died on them.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
Alternator's blown,
battery's dead.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.099
Everything
electronic,

24:09.143 --> 24:10.623
kaput.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.755
There's, uh, blood
on the steering wheel.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.191
Driver was injured.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.889
Or burned.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.586
Didn't realize

24:17.630 --> 24:20.284
you owned a sword that
could melt through metal.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.678
[chuckles]
I don't.

24:22.722 --> 24:25.507
[stammers] They must have...
brought that with 'em.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.031
Whatever you think of me,
Deputy,

24:28.075 --> 24:29.642
let's get one thing straight:

24:29.685 --> 24:32.514
I'm a good cop,
and I know when someone's lying.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.516
Now, you're not leaving here

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
until you give me some truth.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.261
ALEX:
Hey.

24:40.304 --> 24:43.394
Uh, no new news
on the DNA samples

24:43.438 --> 24:44.918
because the machine
is broken,

24:44.961 --> 24:46.746
and the parts
are on backorder.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.530
It's just that kind
of day, isn't it?God, at Genoryx

24:48.574 --> 24:49.705
I would have had this
done in an hour,

24:49.749 --> 24:51.185
and then I'd be able
to find Kyle,

24:51.228 --> 24:52.578
and I'd be able to save Maria.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.318
And maybe all the pressure

24:54.362 --> 24:55.798
you're putting on yourself
isn't helping.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.191
I'm frustrated, Alex.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.541
Why?

24:59.585 --> 25:02.370
Because you couldn't cure
an incurable brain disorder?

25:02.413 --> 25:03.937
At Genoryx...
Hey.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.721
Just forget about Genoryx.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.549
Okay, if you sell
your soul to the devil,

25:07.593 --> 25:09.290
you will always get burned.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.684
Spoken from experience.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.642
So what would you do...

25:13.686 --> 25:16.471
if you were me?

25:16.515 --> 25:19.605
Honestly, I, uh...

25:19.648 --> 25:21.650
I would ask Kyle for advice.

25:21.694 --> 25:24.305
Me, too.

25:24.348 --> 25:25.828
[snorts]

25:25.872 --> 25:27.482
[sighs]

25:27.526 --> 25:29.963
Any ideas what he'd say?

25:30.006 --> 25:31.617
Yeah, actually. That's easy.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.445
He would say, "Nothing has
stopped you before,

25:34.489 --> 25:36.752
and nothing is going
to stop you now."

25:38.319 --> 25:39.712
All right, what about you?

25:39.755 --> 25:41.801
'Cause you're clearly
wrestling with something.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.933
Anything I would bring up,
he would just start ranting

25:43.977 --> 25:45.761
about his code.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.938
[laughing]:
The code.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.940
"Can't give you access to
patients' private files, Liz."

25:50.984 --> 25:53.595
"Stealing resources from
a hospital is wrong, Liz."

25:53.639 --> 25:55.945
He always tries to do
the right thing, you know.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.644
It's not always as easy
as he makes it look.

25:58.687 --> 26:01.298
You know, it's not, like...
it's not always so obvious.

26:01.342 --> 26:04.258
Or maybe it is, and sometimes...

26:04.301 --> 26:06.260
we just don't see it.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.528
You know what,
let me, um...

26:13.572 --> 26:14.921
let me have
the samples.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.792
I think I can get 'em processed.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.751
Really?Yeah.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.449
Okay. Uh, this is the one that
I collected from the shovel.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.755
The other one is Kyle's.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.452
Call me as soon as
you have something.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.585
Yeah, I will.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.768
I'm gonna need a little bit
of your magic, mi bruja.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.689
What would you see
that I'm not?

26:48.563 --> 26:51.784
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna fix this, okay?

26:54.743 --> 26:57.746
'Cause I got your back.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.618
I always do.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.982
[gasps]

27:23.076 --> 27:26.601
I'm sorry I-I pressured you,
and...

27:26.645 --> 27:27.733
No, it's not your fault.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.691
I-I should be
in there, helping,

27:29.735 --> 27:31.127
and not out here
falling apart.

27:31.171 --> 27:34.565
Rosa, we are all falling apart.

27:34.609 --> 27:38.047
I want to find her so bad
I didn't think about how you--

27:40.484 --> 27:41.921
I'm really sorry.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.490
I don't know,
I guess I just thought

27:46.534 --> 27:48.754
that when I got sober,

27:48.797 --> 27:50.930
life would get easier.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.236
I guess it just never will.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.064
Yeah.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.983
Life never gets easier.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.942
We just get stronger.

28:05.118 --> 28:08.164
But it doesn't matter
how strong you get

28:08.208 --> 28:11.211
if you don't stop and
give yourself some credit.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.040
For what it's worth,

28:14.083 --> 28:16.651
I believe that
you can handle this.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.826
Yeah, but I can't.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.524
I mean, I can't even
think straight.

28:20.568 --> 28:21.743
It's so loud.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.745
Yeah.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.182
No, I...

28:26.226 --> 28:28.228
I know that
you mean that literally,

28:28.271 --> 28:31.971
which, obviously,
I can't relate to, but, um...

28:34.887 --> 28:36.802
...after Noah...

28:36.845 --> 28:38.368
[exhales]

28:38.412 --> 28:41.415
...it felt like
he was everywhere.

28:44.200 --> 28:48.814
And I really had to learn...

28:48.857 --> 28:51.207
how to block out that noise.

28:52.948 --> 28:57.736
What makes you feel
safe, calm? Anything?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.955
Music.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.565
I guess the jukebox.

29:01.609 --> 29:05.787
I play a song a lot
when I'm upset.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.007
In the mindscape,
I heard music,

29:08.050 --> 29:10.444
but then there was
a rush of noise.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.620
Do you think the music
is part of a clue?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.970
I don't know.
I couldn't really hear it.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.843
Could you try?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.455
Yeah. Yeah, I'll try.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.677
[indistinct loud chatter]

29:26.721 --> 29:28.114
[plates, cups clattering][sizzling]

29:28.157 --> 29:29.811
[music playing, loud chatter]

29:29.855 --> 29:32.205
ISOBEL:Try and strip away
the noise.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.120
[cries out][chatter continues]

29:36.296 --> 29:38.951
â™ª I'm so dizzy.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.474
[gasps]:
Crashdown.

29:40.517 --> 29:43.172
I heard the song
playing underneath everything,

29:43.216 --> 29:47.307
and it felt like Maria was
in the quiet of that chaos.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.050
Come on, we gotta go.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.573
Hey.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.054
I came as soon as I could
get the sheriff off my back.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.707
Did you try to heal Maria?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.100
No.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.841
I found a handprint
on her scalp.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.975
Well, I-I put a pillow
under her head.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.106
[scoffs]

30:04.150 --> 30:06.500
All I did was-was
lift her head.

30:06.543 --> 30:07.849
Okay, I was...
I was upset.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.982
I was trying to help.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.114
Is she in a coma because of me?

30:12.158 --> 30:13.986
That's the only explanation,
Max.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.509
I mean, after everything,
I'm still the problem.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.642
I mean, is this ever gonna stop?No.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.949
It's not going to, not if
you keep acting like this,

30:20.993 --> 30:23.343
like-like you're the problem.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.085
Is this why you're
still keeping secrets?

30:26.128 --> 30:28.957
I thought we were past this.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.046
Yeah, we are. We are.

30:31.090 --> 30:34.049
I just-- I wasn't prepared
for today.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.794
None of us were.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.190
[sighs] Okay.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.235
You said you spoke
to the sheriff?

30:46.279 --> 30:47.584
Did she have any leads?

30:47.628 --> 30:49.456
No.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.588
Nothing.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.898
Excuse me.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.813
Uh, I need a DNA analysis.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.945
Fill out a request.

30:59.988 --> 31:03.078
I can turn it
around by tomorrow.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.037
Uh, it's for Director Ramos.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.430
He was just here.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.345
Didn't mention anything
about a DNA analysis.

31:09.389 --> 31:12.566
Well, I can have him come back
here and request it himself.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.829
I just feel like, with
everything he's dealing with

31:14.873 --> 31:16.918
right now, I...All right, all right.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.051
Back up the bus.Thank you.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.117
You think it'll take
a while or...?

31:42.161 --> 31:45.077
This isn't
Roswell General.

31:45.120 --> 31:45.991
[door closes]

31:46.034 --> 31:47.557
[keypad beeping]

31:51.213 --> 31:53.085
[computer beeps]

31:53.128 --> 31:56.175
They're a 29.3% match.

31:57.698 --> 32:01.180
Okay, uh, and what does
that mean, exactly?

32:01.223 --> 32:02.485
Blood relatives.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.357
Guessing you know
who this is.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.621
The other could be
an uncle, aunt, nephew.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.623
Anything else?

32:09.666 --> 32:12.104
No. That's it.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.409
Thanks.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.847
Sing it again.[sighs]

32:16.891 --> 32:18.240
It was something like...

32:18.284 --> 32:21.156
â™ª Spinning around
in circles. â™ª

32:21.200 --> 32:23.985
I know that it's in here, but I
just don't remember the title.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.334
[sighs]

32:28.120 --> 32:29.164
Oh, this is it.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.036
That's right, "I'm so dizzy."

32:31.079 --> 32:34.213
[sighs] I knew that it was
one of the old songs

32:34.256 --> 32:35.954
from before
we had updated the jukebox.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.913
So do you think that she's in
a memory with the old jukebox?

32:38.957 --> 32:41.698
I mean, she could be.
I... [sighs]

32:41.742 --> 32:43.396
I mean, maybe she didn't
mean this song.

32:43.439 --> 32:46.573
Maybe it's the one
that we updated it to.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.662
'Cause...

32:48.705 --> 32:51.273
"Roof With a Hole"
by The Meat Puppets?

32:51.317 --> 32:52.796
Meat Puppets?

32:54.668 --> 32:57.236
I know where Maria's trying
to tell us to look for her.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.455
The hole in the roof.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.285
[insects trilling]

33:03.329 --> 33:05.157
Trail of death ends here.

after the tone.

33:09.770 --> 33:10.901
You were wrong.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.469
Kyle's radio
did hijack the towers

33:13.513 --> 33:15.080
in Roswell last night,
and I know why.

33:15.123 --> 33:18.257
Kyle's little radio alien thing

33:18.300 --> 33:21.260
was looking for its receiver.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.131
Its other half.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.220
I tracked it
to this secure facility,

33:25.264 --> 33:29.050
uh, that I cannot get into,
so...

33:29.094 --> 33:31.009
Yeah, I don't need
to spell it out for you.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.314
You know what that means, right?

33:33.533 --> 33:36.536
Whoever's inside knows
what happened to Valenti.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.191
EDUARDO:
Just figure

33:39.234 --> 33:40.409
it out.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.542
I'll be there soon.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.414
What are you doing in here?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.677
The bats weren't drawn
to the Lockhart machine.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.984
They were drawn to this radio.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.072
Be careful with that.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.247
It is one of a kind.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.422
It's two of a kind, actually.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.163
My friend has the other one.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.556
He activated it
last night.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.993
He sent off an SOS signal.

34:00.342 --> 34:01.735
You received it.

34:01.778 --> 34:04.433
That's why the bats
hit the window.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.957
But you lied to me about that.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.611
Which makes me wonder
if you've been lying to me

34:08.655 --> 34:10.091
from the moment I met you.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.962
Did you know
that your DNA

34:12.006 --> 34:14.356
is a 29.3% match
to a friend of mine's?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.837
The missing person
I mentioned.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.273
Your nephew.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.146
I don't have a nephew.

34:22.364 --> 34:26.194
And you don't have
a sample of my DNA.

34:26.238 --> 34:29.154
I hacked into
the medical database.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.679
And the Department of Defense.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.117
Wonder if Kyle knew
that he was calling a man

34:36.161 --> 34:37.118
with suspected terrorist ties

34:37.162 --> 34:39.207
when he activated
the radio.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.904
I guess he knew
something was up.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.298
That's why he hit you
with the shovel.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.606
Your blood's all over it.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.216
You're making something
out of nothing.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.218
I really wish I was.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.353
That was a hefty bandage
for a rabies shot.

34:54.396 --> 34:57.051
I trusted you, and
I shouldn't have.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.662
Where's Kyle?

35:03.362 --> 35:05.146
[exhales]

35:05.190 --> 35:07.801
Once again, wrong question.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.939
I'll be watching her vitals.
Any sudden drops in heart rate

35:15.983 --> 35:18.116
or blood pressure,
and I'm pulling you out, okay?

35:20.205 --> 35:22.207
You ready?Yeah.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.957
I had a hiding
spot up here.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.263
[gasps]

35:43.532 --> 35:46.187
I don't think Maria's in there.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.449
No.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.016
But something is.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.191
Okay.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.367
But why all the subterfuge?

35:52.411 --> 35:54.195
You know,
since this is literally

35:54.239 --> 35:57.329
my second
mindscape rodeo...

35:57.372 --> 35:59.940
I think there's only
one way to find out.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.206
ROSA:Maria.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.903
We're inside
of a memory.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.341
There's something
that she wants us to see.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.560
Maria?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.215
Maria, hey. Uh...

36:14.259 --> 36:15.825
Hey.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.263
[groans]There you go.
There you go.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.438
What happened?

36:19.481 --> 36:21.570
The Regiment--
they attacked Kyle.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.181
At least I think
it was them.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.399
They had masks on, but...

36:24.443 --> 36:25.444
He couldn't
breathe, Max.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.097
He was dying.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.970
I found his bag,
and I gave him some adrenaline.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.014
Where is he now?

36:31.058 --> 36:32.712
MARIA:
He's out there still, I think.

36:32.755 --> 36:33.974
Maria, what happened?

36:34.017 --> 36:35.628
ROSA:
Max said he was attacked

36:35.671 --> 36:38.239
by somebody,
but I don't see anybody.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.415
Someone came from behind me
and they-they grabbed me.

36:40.459 --> 36:44.158
Then Kyle, he came in and
he-he turned the radio on,

36:44.202 --> 36:48.075
and somehow it-it just went
flying out through the doors.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.337
It shattered them.

36:49.381 --> 36:52.166
And the guy
just threw me.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.169
Where's Kyle?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.431
He's gone.

36:56.475 --> 36:57.519
So is your assailant.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.478
So my vision was true.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.131
I couldn't save him.

37:01.175 --> 37:04.178
Max said that
Maria was unconscious.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.267
And he said that he threw
the guy through this window

37:06.311 --> 37:07.573
and that's
how it broke.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.924
Why would he lie about that?

37:13.622 --> 37:16.103
Must have been exhausted,
poor things.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.366
None of us were prepared
for today.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.933
I'm so sorry.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.804
Oh, the case
that Max asked for--

37:21.848 --> 37:24.024
did it do him
any good?

37:24.067 --> 37:25.286
What case?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.548
You didn't get this from me.

may have sustained

37:31.553 --> 37:33.990

37:34.034 --> 37:35.470
Only got one burn
victim last night.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.037
Max wanted
a DNA sample.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.647
Lucky we hadn't taken
the trash out yet.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.040
Gave him some gauze.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.349
I hope it helps.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.438
[papers rustling]

37:48.048 --> 37:49.354
Thanks, Kate.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.052

looking out for her.

38:04.369 --> 38:05.544
What's wrong, Max?

38:05.587 --> 38:08.155
Your visions are
genetically linked.

38:08.198 --> 38:11.463
Yeah,
to my great-grandmother Louise.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.073
Why does that matter?

38:16.424 --> 38:17.991

Of all the books.

38:24.606 --> 38:26.216
Did you just conveniently
forget to tell us

38:26.260 --> 38:27.696
that you had something
buried in the desert?

38:27.740 --> 38:29.394
I wasn't sure it was relevant.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.831
Yesterday you were
honest with me

38:31.874 --> 38:34.094
and today you aren't,
so what has changed?

38:36.052 --> 38:39.055
Hey, I came as soon as I could
get the sheriff off my back.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.580
I found a handprint
on her scalp.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.843
This why you're still
keeping secrets?

38:45.845 --> 38:48.804

'cause you didn't know anything.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.403
That's why she hid the clue.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.535
You're not Max.

39:23.578 --> 39:25.058
Stay away from me.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.668
I'm not gonna hurt you

39:26.712 --> 39:27.974
you give me exactly what I need.
