00:09.166 --> 00:11.100
For those of you who were
solving world peace

00:11.100 --> 00:12.400
or doing brain surgery,

00:12.400 --> 00:14.000
or whatever the fuck
you were doing,

00:14.000 --> 00:15.500
this is what happened
last week on Shameless.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.100
Did you tell
her, Jimmy?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.567
Family, dropped out of
med school, different name...

00:19.567 --> 00:21.100
I remember you from
the neighborhood.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.233
I like you, Miss Fiona.
You're a dirty girl. Like me.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.734
So you gonna
work for me?
I am?

00:24.734 --> 00:26.066
IAN:
Where'd you get the car?

00:26.066 --> 00:27.433
From Steve.
Been working with him a bit.

00:27.433 --> 00:29.000
TONY:
What does she see in him?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.033
We'll find you another skanky
hood girl to obsess about.

00:31.033 --> 00:32.700
Guess what, car just
got reported stolen.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.734
Steve may not be the
guy you think he is.

00:34.734 --> 00:37.233
I think he suspects something.
No, he's just jealous.
We're careful.

00:37.233 --> 00:39.033
STEVE:
Second place sucks, huh?

00:39.033 --> 00:41.066
You bring me in, you risk
Fiona hating you forever.

00:41.066 --> 00:43.567
I'm gonna leave it up to you.
Turn yourself in.
What's the
second choice?

00:43.567 --> 00:46.100
Walk away. Just leave
everything behind.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.266
Dispatch,
this is off-duty officer

00:47.266 --> 00:48.467
reporting a stolen vehicle.

00:48.467 --> 00:49.667
Well, Steve...

00:49.667 --> 00:51.400
My brothers were just arrested.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.033
Whoa, fuck, ah!

00:53.033 --> 00:55.133
My daddy and I recently
went to a Purity Ball.

00:55.133 --> 00:57.266
You show up,
confess your transgressions.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.000
When I did...
You whore!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.133
I'm just glad that my dad's
not around anymore to call me

01:01.133 --> 01:02.166
a whore!

01:02.166 --> 01:04.133
But you have been
kind of a whore.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.700
Get the fuck out
of my house!

Am I still a whore?

for driving.

Tony!
Did you see them?

03:32.467 --> 03:34.133
Still in back.
When can I see them?

03:34.133 --> 03:35.767
If Lip's not charged
as an adult,

03:35.767 --> 03:37.500
you can see them
both in court tomorrow.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.400
Charged as an adult?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.300
He's 17, they may charge him

03:41.300 --> 03:42.667
with felony grand theft auto.

03:42.667 --> 03:45.133
There's no way that Lip would
steal a car. He's too smart.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.567
And Ian doesn't
even drive.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.500
If they didn't steal it...
They didn't steal it!

03:48.500 --> 03:49.734
If they didn't,
then they have to

03:49.734 --> 03:51.200
tell the detectives
who gave them the car

03:51.200 --> 03:53.166
and agree to testify.

03:54.433 --> 03:57.166
If they don't give up a name,
Lip could do five years.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.533

I can't enlist.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.533
What?

04:05.533 --> 04:08.533
In the Marines?

04:08.533 --> 04:12.133
Good. I was planning on
kneecapping you in your sleep

04:12.133 --> 04:15.567

of Kandahar anyway.

Slow study, I guess.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.200
Look...

11:59.200 --> 12:01.734
there's no easy way to say this,
but we have to stop.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.133
It's my boy.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.700
Lip.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.233
I'm sorry, I can't do it to him.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.433
You and me,

12:09.433 --> 12:11.300
I mean, it-it was amazing.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.266
Earth-shattering.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.667
The world turned
on its axis

12:14.667 --> 12:17.533
and all of that.

12:17.533 --> 12:21.133
It was for me, too.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.133
And you, so young and sexy

12:23.133 --> 12:26.667
and taut and
tight and...

12:26.667 --> 12:28.300
But I'm--

12:28.300 --> 12:31.033
I'll still be there
for you, of course.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.734
If you need help
with your homework

12:32.734 --> 12:34.533
or you need me

12:34.533 --> 12:37.767
to teach you how
to drive or...

12:37.767 --> 12:40.133
the toilet
needs plunging.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.166
You know, normal
things between a man

12:42.166 --> 12:45.433
and his girlfriend's
daughter.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.233
But you and me--

12:47.233 --> 12:50.734
a man has to be able
to look his son in the eye.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.033
A man...

12:54.033 --> 12:56.133
has to have
the courage to fight

12:56.133 --> 12:59.266
the things in his nature
that-- you understand--

12:59.266 --> 13:03.567
his passions, his
needs and desires.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.066
Well, okay.

13:05.066 --> 13:06.300
There, I've said it.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.700
You go back to Lip,
I'll go back to your mother.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.166
Yes? Okay?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.200
Good. Good.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.500
Here, here.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.333
Get yourself
something nice.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.367
(tires screech)

13:35.500 --> 13:37.166
What the hell
is that?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.467
Your Cayenne.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.100
Supposed to
be black.

13:40.100 --> 13:40.767
Paint it.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.033
(sighs)

13:44.033 --> 13:45.000
What?

13:45.000 --> 13:45.734
I need my end.

13:45.734 --> 13:47.467
You'll get it
when I get it.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.033
No, I need it now.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.333
You-- all right,
I got a job.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.433
Not interested.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.667
Bring me two Lexuses.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.500
Black if possible,
450 LS's.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.066
There's only
three grand in here.

14:00.066 --> 14:01.033
Look, bring me the 450s,

14:01.033 --> 14:02.500
I'll give you ten grand
next week.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.133
I'm not gonna be here next week;
I'm not gonna be here tomorrow.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.567
All right, come back tonight,
I'll get you the ten grand.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.567
What?

14:10.567 --> 14:13.500
Hold onto my money,
I'll be back for it.

14:16.433 --> 14:18.200
Detective.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.433
Yeah?

14:19.433 --> 14:21.467
Case landed on your desk
last night-- Gallagher,

14:21.467 --> 14:22.500
Phillip and Ian?

14:22.500 --> 14:23.767
Yeah.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.533
What's it going to
take to let them walk?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.166
Markovich, is it?

14:29.166 --> 14:31.667
You related somehow?

14:31.667 --> 14:33.033
They're from my
neighborhood.

14:33.033 --> 14:34.166
Good kids.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.667
Lip's bright as hell,
doing great at school.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.600
Ian's in ROTC, wants
to join the Marines.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.133
They wouldn't have
been in that car

14:39.133 --> 14:40.333
if they knew
it was stolen.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.400
So, uh, you just know them
from around the neighborhood,

14:44.400 --> 14:45.533
is that it?

14:45.533 --> 14:49.133
I'm pretty close
to their sister.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.367
Oh.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.667
They get off, I promise,

14:51.667 --> 14:55.033
I'll kick their asses
up and down the block.

14:55.033 --> 14:58.266
Well, they gotta tell me
who gave them that car.

14:58.266 --> 15:01.100
They won't snitch
and you know it.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.533
Then they're
doing time.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.734
Bears tickets.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.400
45 yard line,

15:13.400 --> 15:14.533
23 rows up.

15:14.533 --> 15:17.233
You pick the game.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.600
Two games.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.233
(sniffs)

15:22.333 --> 15:25.433
All eight games
next season.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.467
Fine.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.734
Preseason and playoffs.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.567
Hey.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.033
Hey.

15:54.033 --> 15:56.100
(Fiona and Lip grunt)

16:05.166 --> 16:06.100
KEVIN:
Ah!

16:06.100 --> 16:07.633
You guys popped your cherry!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.567
Hey, did you guys
see my dad in there?

16:09.567 --> 16:11.633
(laughter)

16:17.667 --> 16:19.200
They give you a
cavity search?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.500
No, we weren't there
long enough.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.467
Think it was probably
on the menu, though.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.400
Hey, it's Karen.
Leave a message.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.467
Hey, Karen, it's me.

16:25.467 --> 16:28.633
Um, call me back when you get
this message, all right?

16:28.633 --> 16:31.400
See anybody
get shanked?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.233
We were cuffed to a bench in a
hallway most of the night, Carl.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.433
(knock, door opens)

16:36.433 --> 16:37.500
Clean towels.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.166
You both need showers;
you're rank.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.100
I'll go first.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.100
They take your
belts and shoelaces

16:45.100 --> 16:46.300
so you wouldn't
hang yourselves?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.066
Carl, go help Veronica
with dinner.

16:48.066 --> 16:50.000
I helped with breakfast.
You pulled out
a cereal bowl.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.033
Go.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.266
So?

17:06.367 --> 17:07.467
I'm sorry, Fiona.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.633
It was stupid.

17:08.633 --> 17:12.133
Could have ended
up in prison.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.333
Where'd you get
the stolen car?

17:18.333 --> 17:20.233
Lip's not here, okay?

17:20.233 --> 17:22.100
I'm asking you.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.133
Was it from Steve?

17:33.233 --> 17:35.033
Hey, Fiona.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.033
I'm gay.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.200
I know.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.533
I should have told you
a long time ago.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.133
I-I don't know why I didn't.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.033
You're still on my shit list.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.066
(door closes)

18:10.100 --> 18:12.200
(rock music blaring)

18:17.066 --> 18:20.667
♪ Girlfriend for hours ♪

18:20.667 --> 18:24.533

18:24.533 --> 18:27.467

18:45.133 --> 18:47.667
Mind over matter.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.700
That's the trick
in matters of the flesh.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.734
It's all about willpower.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.567
Some people have
it, some don't.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.200
Me? Got it in spades.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.100
Ah!

18:57.100 --> 19:00.200
Lip and Ian
were released.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.367
Released from what?

19:02.367 --> 19:03.467
Jail.

19:03.467 --> 19:04.467
Huh.

19:04.467 --> 19:07.166
About time, too.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.600
You must struggle with
temptation, Kevin.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.734
Nubile, young temptress
traipsing around your house.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.467
In and out of the bathroom

19:14.467 --> 19:17.000
in her dainty little undies.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.467
Are you talking
about Ethel?

19:18.467 --> 19:20.467
What is she, 13?

19:20.467 --> 19:22.433
Fourteen?

19:22.433 --> 19:23.500
They know.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
They pretend they don't,
but they do.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.700
Hannah Montana?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.400
Those oversexed kids
on Glee?

19:29.400 --> 19:34.100
Think they're selling good,
wholesome, all-American fun?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.367
Hell, no!

19:35.367 --> 19:38.233
Flesh and underage temptation.

19:38.233 --> 19:39.233
You can look,

19:39.233 --> 19:42.100
but, oh, no,
don't touch.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.367
Fuck off, Frank.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.433
We see firm young bodies,

19:45.433 --> 19:48.600
every synapse
in our cerebellum screams,

19:48.600 --> 19:51.700
"procreate,
impregnate!"

19:51.700 --> 19:53.767
It's not our fault.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.400
We're driven by the deep,

19:55.400 --> 19:58.533
invaluable,
evolutionary need

19:58.533 --> 20:01.367
to perpetuate the species.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.500
My brother
Bennie's girl-- 15.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.667
Running around his house
in short shorts, lace bra,

20:07.667 --> 20:10.400
underwear hanging out.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.066
I banged Filipino hookers
in the Navy

20:12.066 --> 20:13.300
looked more innocent
than my niece.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.400
All right, you two
sick fucks are cut off.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.467
Willpower, my friend!

20:19.467 --> 20:22.266
Willpower!

20:22.266 --> 20:25.333
We are warriors battling against

20:25.333 --> 20:28.000
the dark forces
of our primal nature.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.533
Knights taking up arms against

20:31.533 --> 20:35.200
our animalistic impulses
in a debauched culture.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.400
Doing battle every day,
gentlemen.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.000
Every single day!

20:45.500 --> 20:47.266
Season tickets?

20:47.266 --> 20:49.233
Just for the year.

20:49.233 --> 20:52.433
Playoffs, too?

20:52.433 --> 20:53.633
Jesus.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.300
This Fiona better be the
best pussy you ever had.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.233
She's the only pussy
I ever had.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.367
Check out
this idiot.

21:14.033 --> 21:15.700
You stupid
or just hard of hearing?

21:15.700 --> 21:17.133
Ian and Lip
are in jail.

21:17.133 --> 21:19.533
I thought I told you
to leave town.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.433
They were driving
a car that I stole.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.300
Yeah, yeah, I know.
They told you?

21:23.300 --> 21:26.100
No, of course not;
they're South Side.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.734
You got to
get them off.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.033
Yeah, and why's that?

21:29.033 --> 21:30.166
'Cause they're
innocent.

21:30.166 --> 21:32.166
They didn't know they were
driving a stolen car?

21:37.600 --> 21:40.133
I'll give you
the house.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.333
What?

21:42.333 --> 21:46.333
The house that I
bought beside Fiona's.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.266
I'll give you the
title; it's paid for.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.333
You get the charges
dropped, it's yours.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.300
You paid for a house in cash?

21:52.300 --> 21:54.133
It's a shitty neighborhood;
I could have bought two.

21:54.133 --> 21:55.467
How many cars have you stolen?

21:55.467 --> 21:57.100
Do we have a
deal or not?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.467
Nothing else is
changed; you're gone.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.467
You don't see her,
don't call, don't write.

22:04.467 --> 22:07.467
Disappear.

22:07.467 --> 22:09.467
I'm gone tonight.

22:17.333 --> 22:19.433
What the hell was that?

22:21.266 --> 22:23.133
I think I may have
just found a way

22:23.133 --> 22:25.767
to move out of my
mom's basement.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.367
Good job, good job.
VERONICA:
Hey, where is everyone?!

22:32.367 --> 22:33.500
Kitchen!

22:33.500 --> 22:37.166
Chopped up some leftover chuck
for Bolognese Ragu.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.233
I hope everybody is
good and hungry.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.166
Hey.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.200
Carl, set the table.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.100
Hi! I'm Jasmine.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.066
Oh, sorry.

22:44.066 --> 22:45.100
Jasmine,
this is Veronica.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.367
V lives next door.

22:46.367 --> 22:47.533
Hiya, V.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.100
Those are great boots.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.100
Macy's?

22:50.100 --> 22:51.333
Famous Footwear.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.233
Oh, wow. I got to
check that place out.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.000
Pour yourself
some bubbly, V.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.266
We are celebrating
the boys' big breakout.

22:57.266 --> 23:00.200
Silverware, plates, now.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.266
Brought some Chianti.

23:01.266 --> 23:03.200
Oh, great.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.734
Well, we're making
stir-fry.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.100
Hey, try this.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.266
Ready?

23:08.266 --> 23:09.433
Perfect.
Good?

23:09.433 --> 23:11.066
All right, do you
want to try it?

23:11.066 --> 23:12.066
Oh, no.
Okay.

23:12.066 --> 23:13.266
What do you got there, V?

23:13.266 --> 23:14.166
What's in here?

23:14.166 --> 23:16.533
I, um, I made
some pasta sauce.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.300
Oh. Good, good.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.400
Well, you know,
with teenage boys

37:53.567 --> 37:55.033
passing around,
uh, "Daddyzgirl,"

37:55.033 --> 37:56.667
why don't you, uh, send
her over to our place?

37:56.667 --> 37:58.500
Someone's got to pop this

39:25.767 --> 39:29.066
Carl will be saying,

Afraid, if you ever do
something even remotely selfish,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.533
the earth's

Go!

41:10.567 --> 41:12.200
Why would he do this?

41:12.200 --> 41:14.567
Because he's
a fucking psycho.

41:14.567 --> 41:17.367
I told him straight--

41:17.367 --> 41:19.567
very nice,
very reasonable.

41:19.567 --> 41:21.600
"You'll get
your 40 bucks

when my new disability
claim kicks in."

41:24.734 --> 41:28.467
The next thing I know,
he's beating me to death.

41:28.467 --> 41:31.333
Honey, this is
all over money?

41:31.333 --> 41:33.266
You should have
asked me for it.

41:33.266 --> 41:34.567
I would have
given it to you.

41:34.567 --> 41:37.500
No. I couldn't
take advantage.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.133
Sweetie.

41:39.133 --> 41:41.600
You are too
easy on them.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.433
They don't
deserve you.

You know,

you're the only one
who's nice to me.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.333
Oh, honey.
