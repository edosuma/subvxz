00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:25.192
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:25.275 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:38.413 --> 00:40.415
"A New Truck in Town."

00:48.549 --> 00:50.884
Lots of chores to do today, Celeste.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.470
What are you gonna do first?

00:55.138 --> 00:57.683
Let's start by fixing this fence.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.897
Gonna fix this fence with beams and post.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.900
Helping's what I like the most.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.778
I love how your digger
spins, spins, spins.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.029
Like this.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.910
Now for the fence post.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.336
That's oink-cellent fence building, Otis.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.589
Thanks. But we're not done yet.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.591
Spin, spin, spin.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.638
Celeste?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.099
Where'd you go?

01:40.309 --> 01:41.518
Celeste?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.148
Celeste?

01:48.567 --> 01:49.818
Hit the brakes!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.279
Are you okay?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.824
That noise scares me.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.661
Celeste.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.164
Wanna know what I do when I'm scared?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.124
Uh-huh.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.878
Putt, puff, puttedy cho.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.298
Take a deep breath, nice and slow.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.264
Wanna go see
what made that noise together?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.933
Uh-huh.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.685
All right, let's get rolling.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.940
Now, where did that noise come from?

02:30.567 --> 02:31.693
Look, Celeste.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.613
It's a bird!

02:39.993 --> 02:41.203
Hello there, birdie.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.460
Thanks, Otis. You're such a hearty helper.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.379
You're welcome, Celeste.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.381
Now back to the fence.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.509
Gonna fix this fence with beams and post.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.136
Helping's what I like the most.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.474
Who is that?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.643
Yeah!

03:09.940 --> 03:11.775
It's a new truck.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.905
Hi. I'm Otis,
and this is my friend Celeste.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.034
-Hello.
-Hi, I'm Kevin. I just moved here.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.538
And it looks like
there's already work to do.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
Scary and loud!

03:30.294 --> 03:33.463
It's okay, Celeste.
That was just Kevin's horn.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.929
Thanks, Otis.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.974
Maybe Kevin can help us finish the fence?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.230
Nailed it.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.525
Look at that.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.486
I thought it would take us all day
to fix that fence.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.280
And it's done already.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.618
That truck is good at fixing fences.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.330
Fixing the fence was my job.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.169
Yeah! That was truck-tacular.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.422
What else can I do? Kevin's revving to go.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.180
Kevin's so big and fast.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.766
Do you think the farm
needs my help anymore?

04:25.849 --> 04:29.353
Of course. You're so good
at helping everyone.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.646
Thanks, Celeste.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.399
Those hay bales need hauling.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.692
I gotta vroom.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.194
See you later.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.998
I'm a hearty hay helper.
I'm gonna pick up all these--

04:59.132 --> 05:01.760
It's a great day to work in the hay.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.973
There's one more. I can get it.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.476
Got it.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.148
Kevin's really good at loading hay bales.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.276
So much faster than I am.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.156
That sounds like Frisky.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.494
Frisky!

05:27.578 --> 05:28.787
Hit the brakes.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.291
Frisky? What are you doing up there?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.045
You're scared?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.260
Can I help you get down?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.433
Hop on.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.061
There you go.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.442
Now let's get rolling back to the barn.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.545
You're welcome.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.422
I'll help you any time, Frisky.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.675
Next chore. Moving all these barrels.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.428
I can help with that.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.685
Bring on the barrels.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.817
I can take that last one too, Otis.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.406
But I wanted to help.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.707
Hi, little chickadees.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.051
Hit the brakes.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.137
Your ball went into that barrel.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.642
I know you're sad.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.481
Hey, I'm a hearty helper.
Want me to get it for you?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.486
Let's get rolling.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.864
Stand back, little chickies.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.956
You're welcome.

07:39.293 --> 07:42.546
Come on! Let's get trucking
to do the next chore, Otis.

07:51.180 --> 07:55.225
Gotta get this stump out of the ground.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.479
Maybe Kevin can try.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.657
Wow. You did it, Kevin.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.630
Kevin is bigger, faster, stronger.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.299
He's better at everything.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.677
I guess no one needs
a little tractor like me anymore.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.308
Hit the brakes. Was that Celeste?

08:37.392 --> 08:39.394
Help!

08:42.063 --> 08:43.732
I'm coming, Celeste.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.868
I'm stuck in this super sticky mud!

08:56.495 --> 08:58.330
Can you help get me out of here?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.665
I'm scared.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.878
I sure can.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.549
Putt, puff, puttedy cho.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.927
Take a deep breath, nice and slow.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.730
I'll get you out, Celeste.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.407
Almost got it. Come on.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.159
Now I'm getting stuck.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.581
Kevin, I think your loud horn
is scaring Celeste.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.624
Could you please stop beeping it?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.420
Oh, no. I didn't mean to scare her.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.005
What should we do, Otis?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.673
We need a plan.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.384
I've got to use the gears between my ears.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.225
Great gears! We can pull her out.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.898
We'll get you out of there soon, Celeste.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.275
Okay, Otis.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.444
Kevin, can you toss me your towline?

10:10.527 --> 10:11.945
You got it, Otis.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.161
Thanks. Now let's get rolling to help.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.914
Celeste, can you hold on to this towline?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.498
I sure can.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.461
I got it!

10:27.544 --> 10:29.755
Okay, hold on tight.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.592
Kevin, we're going to pull Celeste
out of the mud together.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.010
Okay, Otis.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.470
Let's go!

10:37.888 --> 10:39.848
Just keep holding on, Celeste.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.060
Almost. Almost.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.436
Keep going.

10:46.897 --> 10:47.981
I'm out!

10:48.482 --> 10:49.608
Yeah!

10:49.691 --> 10:53.111
Otis, that was a farm-tastic idea.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.364
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

10:56.365 --> 10:58.242
And thank you too, Kevin.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.912
-I'm so happy I'm out of there.
-Me too.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.545
Wow, Otis. You're such a hearty helper.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.879
You think so?

11:10.963 --> 11:12.005
Yeah.

11:12.089 --> 11:16.176
You rolled in so fast
and knew exactly how to help.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.971
Well, on this farm,
we all help each other.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.890
Come on, Kevin.

11:21.974 --> 11:25.477
Let's go introduce you
to the rest of our farm friends.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.897
Hey, everyone. This is Kevin.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.776
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-You're gonna love it here.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.410
"The Sheep Who Couldn't Sleep."

11:52.629 --> 11:54.256
Good night, chickens.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.055
Good night, pigs.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.482
Good night, farm.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.996
Good night, Daisy and Rosalie.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.624
Night night.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.585
You too, Polly.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.138
The end of another farm-tastic day.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.066
Sounds like someone's still awake.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.570
It's not Daisy or Rosalie.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.118
This isn't working.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.962
It's not Celeste or the pigs.
They're still asleep too.

13:20.592 --> 13:25.180
Maybe it's Sal. That rooster is always
the last one to go to sleep.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.684
Corn, corn, corn.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.854
Corn.

13:33.522 --> 13:37.317
Corn. Sweet, sweet corn.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.824
Cock-a-doodle corn everywhere.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.873
It wasn't Sal.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.750
This sounds like a good dream.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.253
If I just...

13:57.754 --> 13:59.840
That's not good either.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.759
I think it's coming from over there.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.303
Why can't I...

14:09.641 --> 14:10.893
Maybe if I...

14:13.228 --> 14:16.273
Hit the brakes. It's Louie.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.114
Are you okay, Louie?

14:24.198 --> 14:28.577
Otis. No matter what I do,
I can't fall asleep.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.121
But I'm so tired.

14:34.249 --> 14:38.128
I know how you feel, Louie.
Sometimes I can't sleep.

14:38.212 --> 14:39.963
Can you help me?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.465
I could try.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.718
I just have to use
the gears between my ears.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.600
You know what I do sometimes
when I can't sleep?

14:51.683 --> 14:52.976
What? What?

14:57.481 --> 14:58.649
What?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.317
I count sheep.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.902
Count sheep?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.445
Do you wanna try it?

15:03.529 --> 15:04.780
I'll try anything!

15:05.280 --> 15:07.741
Okay. Let's get rolling.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.912
All you have to do is close your eyes...

15:12.996 --> 15:17.501
and imagine lots of sleepy sheep
jumping over a fence.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.169
-One by--
-One.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.337
Uh-oh.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.005
Two.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.466
-Three.
-Louie.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.551
Four.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.144
Five.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.862
Can you please be a little quieter?

15:46.405 --> 15:48.532
Cock-a-doodle-do.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.035
What's going on?

15:53.036 --> 15:55.122
Is it morning already?

16:00.419 --> 16:01.837
Hit the brakes.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.339
The whole farm is awake.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.729
Louie, I didn't mean count the real sheep.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.940
I count pretend sheep. In my head.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.331
Polly-pup.
Did all the noise wake you up too?

16:41.126 --> 16:43.128
I'm tired.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.839
-Me too.
-Me three.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.845
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake everyone.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.097
I feel bad.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.894
We know, Louie.

16:58.977 --> 17:02.689
There's got to be a way to help you
and the whole farm get back to sleep.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.444
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

17:08.529 --> 17:11.406
We'll help everyone sleep
and we won't give up.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.371
Would it help to hear a lullaby?

17:18.497 --> 17:20.165
Yes, please.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.335
-Thank you, Otis.
-Let's try it.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.714
Putt, puff, puttedy cheep

17:27.798 --> 17:31.051
It's time for all of us to sleep

17:35.347 --> 17:38.100
That does make me feel sleepy.

17:39.268 --> 17:40.853
Thanks, Otis.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.897
Come on, everyone. Let's go back to sleep.

17:46.567 --> 17:49.695
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff

17:49.778 --> 17:53.240
The sun's gone down and the moon is up

18:01.832 --> 18:05.085
Putt, puff, puttedy dig

18:05.169 --> 18:09.006
Nighty night to all the pigs

18:11.258 --> 18:12.551
Night night.

18:14.344 --> 18:18.015
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff

18:18.098 --> 18:21.351
Good night cows and Polly-pup

18:28.775 --> 18:32.237
Putt, puff, puttedy peep

18:32.321 --> 18:36.241
Now the whole farm is asleep

18:42.706 --> 18:47.294
Why... can't I fall asleep?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
Hit the brakes.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.384
Louie.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.595
You're still awake?

18:58.263 --> 18:59.598
I know.

19:00.224 --> 19:03.852
I'm frustrated 'cause
I can't get comfortable.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.485
Let me see what sleeping here is like.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.403
Okay.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.534
It's quiet.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.538
And comfy.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.836
I wonder what the problem is.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.008
Wait a second.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.262
It's the full moon.

19:38.846 --> 19:41.098
We just need to block the light.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.351
But we can't turn off the moon. Can we?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.562
No. But...

19:50.065 --> 19:52.359
there may be something we can do.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.748
What are you doing, Otis?

20:07.332 --> 20:10.878
Just a little tractor trick.

20:12.963 --> 20:14.256
Come on.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.342
Just a little bit higher.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.474
There.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.941
So much better.

20:35.694 --> 20:39.198
Actually, maybe not so dark?

20:41.575 --> 20:42.701
Good idea.

20:53.462 --> 20:55.714
Thanks for helping me sleep, Otis.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.302
You're welcome, Louie.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.597
Putt, puff, puttedy pack

21:03.680 --> 21:07.476
I'll see you when the sun is back

21:07.559 --> 21:09.811
Good night, Otis.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.813
Night night, Louie.

21:19.530 --> 21:22.533
I think I'm ready for bed now too.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.169
Yellow corn.

21:35.838 --> 21:38.131
Crunchy yellow corn.

21:41.218 --> 21:44.555
Putt, puff, puttedy bean

21:44.638 --> 21:48.100
Good night, Sal, enjoy your dreams

21:49.893 --> 21:52.938
Putt, puff, puttedy jig

21:53.021 --> 21:56.984
Good night, Celeste and all the pigs

22:06.326 --> 22:07.578
Otis...

22:09.204 --> 22:11.456
you're such a hearty helper.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.001
On our farm...

22:17.129 --> 22:19.173
we all help each other.
