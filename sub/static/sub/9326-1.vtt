<i>Here Friday morning.</i>
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,996
<i>Now, let's get the stocks here in London.</i>

02:45.031 --> 02:49.604
<i>The Financial Times 100 Index up 11 points,
just above the key 3,800 level.</i>

02:49.869 --> 02:54.545
<i>In the rest of Europe, Frankfurt's DAX
gaining nine points to 2,532.</i>

02:54.707 --> 02:58.711
<i>In Paris, the CAC 40 losing seven,
the weaker franc weighing on the market.</i>

03:13.593 --> 03:15.265
Thank you, Ilsa.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.034
Have a nice day.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.614
<i>...they are on time this morning.</i>

03:33.913 --> 03:35.585
<i>San Francisco's freeways are...</i>

03:51.631 --> 03:53.298
Morning, sir.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.999
<i>Tell me
what we're supposed to do.</i>

03:55.034 --> 04:00.573
<i>You may be perched on majority shares,
but we all get fucked if the actuals crash.</i>

04:00.608 --> 04:02.006
<i>That old man is gonna sink us.</i>

04:02.041 --> 04:06.956
As soon as I have Baer/Grant's
P&L report in hand, I will call you.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.982
<i>- Is that a promise?
- I'm sorry, I'm not aware of that term.</i>

04:11.017 --> 04:14.921
<i>Well, what do I do if Anson calls
about substantiation procedure?</i>

04:14.956 --> 04:17.790
Have your secretary say
you're in a meeting.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.591
Thank you, Jack.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.366
- Yes, Maria?
- Invitations.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.571
- The Museum Gala.
- No.

04:23.796 --> 04:26.833
- Fitzwilliam Botanical Annual Fundraiser.
- No.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.237
- The Hinchberger wedding.
- Hinchberger wedding?

04:31.104 --> 04:34.244
Tuxedos, droning conversations,
I don't think so, no.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.378
I'll send your regrets.
Honestly, why must I bother?

04:38.413 --> 04:40.178
If you don't know about society,

04:40.213 --> 04:43.082
you don't have
the satisfaction of avoiding it.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.027
- Yes?
- I have an Elizabeth on line three.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.831
Your ex-wife.
- I know who it is.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.697
Take a message.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.866
Oh, happy birthday, sir.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.270
Thank you, Maggie.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.569
I don't like her.

05:04.604 --> 05:07.974
I wouldn't mention the following,
but he was very insistent.

05:08.009 --> 05:10.308
- It's a prank.
- What?

05:10.343 --> 05:14.347
A gentleman called requesting lunch.
I assured him you were busy...

05:14.382 --> 05:17.418
- What's his name?
- A Mr. Seymour Butts.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.359
Uhder The Bleachers by Seymour Butts.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.565
I'm sorry?

05:25.558 --> 05:29.529
Cancel my lunch. Make a reservation
at the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.099
My usual table.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.177
Maria, put the reservation under my name.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.510
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- No, I'm still waiting.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.216
This was iced tea.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.828
- Conrad, what a surprise.
- Happy birthday, Nickie.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.735
"Seymour Butts".
I'll never get tired of that one.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.959
That's why it's a classic.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.364
Nice restaurant. They gave me a free jacket.

06:04.399 --> 06:06.309
I'm sure they'll want it back.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.218
- I remember being here.
- I took you here once.

06:09.253 --> 06:12.004
No, I used to buy crystal meth
off the maître d'.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.138
- Really?
- In college.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.880
<i>- Which college?
- Touchè.</i>

06:18.144 --> 06:19.350
Miss me?

06:19.946 --> 06:22.914
As much as that's possible. You look good.

06:22.949 --> 06:26.862
- So do you. To think I was worried.
- Worried about me?

06:27.453 --> 06:31.093
How long's it been since Mom's funeral?
Two, three years.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.428
- I thought you quit.
- I did, it didn't take.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.408
- You can't smoke here.
- I'm with you.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.072
It's illegal to smoke in restaurants
in California.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.170
Fuck California.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.751
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.942
- Elizabeth?
- We're divorced.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.683
She remarried a pediatrician,
or a gynecologist,

06:53.718 --> 06:56.390
or a pediatric gynecologist.
Lives in Sausalito.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.890
That's too bad. I liked her.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.590
- And what about you?
- You don't keep track of me anymore?

07:04.891 --> 07:07.200
Not since family week at rehab.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.397
So what brings you to town, Conrad?
Everything all right?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.266
- Yeah.
- Need anything?

07:13.301 --> 07:14.745
- No.
- Really?

07:15.234 --> 07:16.734
No, I don't need anything from you.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.339
I just found myself laying naked
on a beach near Ibiza

07:20.374 --> 07:22.527
and all of a sudden it clicked,

07:22.562 --> 07:24.681
October 12th, Nickie's birthday.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.915
- October 11 th.
- Whatever.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.694
- This is for you.
- You shouldn't have.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.527
What do you get for the man
who has everything?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.085
Consumer Recreation Services.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.208
Well, I do have golf clubs.

07:48.568 --> 07:49.944
Call that number.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.576
- Why?
- It'll make your life fun.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.641
- Fun.
- You know what that is?

07:56.676 --> 08:00.880
You've seen other people have it.
It's an entertainment service.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.654
An escort service?

08:03.449 --> 08:05.618
A profound life experience.

08:07.353 --> 08:10.766
Sorry. I'll just get...
- Nah, it's all right, just...

08:12.124 --> 08:14.060
- Tell me you'll call.
- I said I would.

08:14.095 --> 08:15.368
No, you didn't.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.642
You still on medication?

08:20.900 --> 08:23.719
- Why would you say that?
You gentlemen ready to order?

08:23.754 --> 08:26.539
- I didn't mean how it sounded.
- I'm not on anything.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.842
I'm not even seeing a shrink.
And I feel great.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.252
Do you mind?

08:35.081 --> 08:37.248
I think you'll like this. I did.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.990
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.159
- I'll call them.
- Do it. For you.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.058
I said I'll call, okay? All right, I'll call.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.595
It's just that... I hate surprises.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.264
I know.

08:53.266 --> 09:00.371
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

09:00.406 --> 09:04.319
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. Van Orton</i>

09:04.544 --> 09:08.253
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

09:13.753 --> 09:17.063
<i>Someone's gotta
drive a stake through Anson's heart.</i>

09:17.356 --> 09:18.824
<i>Have you seen
the profitability report?</i>

09:18.859 --> 09:21.192
Lmagine how unhappy I am.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.563
<i>You'll deal with Anson?
- Correct.</i>

09:23.598 --> 09:25.098
<i>We're furious.</i>

09:25.731 --> 09:28.108
<i>- Sleep well, Nicholas.
- I will.</i>

10:28.194 --> 10:29.760
Good night, Ilsa.

10:29.795 --> 10:34.141
- Dinner's in the oven.
- Thank you. Oh, I saw Conrad today.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.745
- Did you? How is he?
- He's okay.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.414
I think he's in a personal improvement cult.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.119
Well, send my love if you see him again.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.850
- Happy birthday.
- Good night.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.977
<i>...companies that defaulted
on their payments.</i>

11:19.078 --> 11:24.960
<i>The FCC expects to receive
more than $500 million in bids...</i>

11:26.018 --> 11:29.288
<i>- Elizabeth, good evening.
- Happy birthday, Nickie.</i>

11:29.323 --> 11:32.428
11:40. You almost missed it this year.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.830
<i>- Have you had a nice birthday?
- Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress?</i>

11:37.865 --> 11:41.402
I went not once, but twice,
through the spanking machine.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.878
<i>I can only imagine.</i>

11:44.370 --> 11:47.640
<i>- How are you?
- Connie asked me the same thing today.</i>

11:47.675 --> 11:50.711
<i>Connie? Really? I always liked your brother.</i>

11:52.178 --> 11:53.452
Anyway...

11:53.846 --> 11:56.916
<i>I just thought this might be difficult for you.</i>

11:56.951 --> 11:58.827
Just another birthday.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.664
<i>Because of your father.</i>

12:02.421 --> 12:06.892
That's right, he was 48, wasn't he?
I hadn't thought about it until now.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.628
<i>Why do I call?</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:12.974
I honestly don't know.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.200
Please send Dr. Mel and Rachel my best.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.978
<i>She has a little brother on the way.
We did the ultrasound.</i>

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Official nuclear family.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.342
You must be very pleased.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.948
<i>We are. We are very pleased.</i>

12:28.647 --> 12:31.150
Well, it's good to talk with you...

12:31.717 --> 12:33.584
<i>I guess I should let you go.</i>

12:33.619 --> 12:37.890
<i>- Take care of yourself.
- You too, Nicholas. I mean that, I really do.</i>

12:37.925 --> 12:39.664
Be well. Bye.

12:40.826 --> 12:43.360
<i>A proposal to encourage small businesses</i>

12:43.395 --> 12:46.398
<i>to provide their employees
with health insurance</i>

12:46.433 --> 12:49.366
<i>is now being debated
by Washington legislators.</i>

12:49.401 --> 12:54.273
<i>The bill, which attaches small-business
health plans to those of larger corporations</i>

12:54.308 --> 12:58.476
<i>is receiving initial support
from a number of key Republican leaders.</i>

12:58.511 --> 13:03.050
<i>However, Democratic lawmakers
are voicing serious concerns about the bill,</i>

13:03.382 --> 13:06.192
<i>claiming that it would undermine local...</i>

13:31.710 --> 13:35.146
I just wanted to make sure
that we understand each other.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.459
Once you get it down on paper,
then you can count on my full support.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.321
- We understand.
- Thank you.

13:42.356 --> 13:43.959
We'll talk soon.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.262
You shouldn't feel
this reflects negatively on you.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.332
<i>I do feel this reflects...</i>

14:25.731 --> 14:27.598
- I received this...
- Just a moment.

14:27.633 --> 14:31.337
<i>- I took these tests in good faith.
I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

14:31.372 --> 14:34.907
We hope we haven't caused you
any inconvenience.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.011
Thank you for choosing CRS.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.045
Mr. Feingold,
could you assist this gentleman?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.580
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.282
Jim Feingold, VP Engineering,
Data Analysis.

14:45.317 --> 14:49.560
I don't know exactly how this works.
My brother sent me this card as a gift.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.308
All right, excellent. Let's get started.

14:53.343 --> 14:56.662
I'm sorry about all this hullabaloo here.

14:56.697 --> 14:59.108
We're... Well, we're still moving.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.471
I got an office around here somewhere.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.739
Do you mind holding that?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.716
Thank you very much.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.544
Thank you.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.448
- Are you hungry? New Moon Cafè.
- No, thank you.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.120
Best in Chinatown.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.534
A gift from Conrad Van Orton.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.692
- Interesting.
- What is?

15:28.727 --> 15:32.062
Your brother was a client
with our London branch.

15:32.097 --> 15:36.375
We do a sort of informal scoring.
His numbers are outstanding.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.009
Really?

15:38.470 --> 15:41.206
- You sure you're not hungry?
- No.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.908
Now, you need to fill out these forms.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.745
There's an application
and a couple of psych tests.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.690
The MMPI and the TAT.

15:49.181 --> 15:53.285
For the financial questionnaire,
don't answer anything you don't feel like.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.889
We'll run a TRW.

15:55.487 --> 15:58.763
"I sometimes hurt small animals.
True or false?"

16:01.393 --> 16:03.896
"I feel guilty when I masturbate. "

16:04.997 --> 16:09.401
Well, I don't write the questions.
I just review the answers.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.476
- What is this for?
- A sense of your capabilities...

16:17.511 --> 16:20.422
No, what is this for? What are you selling?

16:21.747 --> 16:22.918
Oh...

16:23.248 --> 16:25.182
- It's a game.
- A game?

16:25.217 --> 16:28.129
Specifically tailored for each participant.

16:28.687 --> 16:33.325
Think of it as a great vacation.
Except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.532
What kind of vacation?

16:36.395 --> 16:39.933
- It's different every time.
- Humor me with specifics.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.509
We provide

16:44.737 --> 16:46.503
whatever's lacking.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.675
- What if nothing is lacking?
- May I make two suggestions?

16:49.710 --> 16:52.810
You think I'll participate without knowing...

16:52.845 --> 16:56.155
First, admit to yourself
that it sounds intriguing.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.484
Second, you don't have to decide today.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.618
Take the silly test, fill out the forms.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.890
One day, your game begins.
You either love it or hate it.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.391
Decide then.

17:06.892 --> 17:12.397
You know, we're like
an experiential Book-of-the-Month Club.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.904
You can drop out at any time
with no further obligation.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.616
That was my sales pitch.

17:21.373 --> 17:25.444
- How long will this take?
- An hour for those, an hour for the physical.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.644
- Physical?
- It's a cursory examination.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.422
Turn your head and cough.
You'll be out of here in no time.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.706
Confused.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.710
Risky.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.818
Bloody.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.657
Whoops.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.842
<i>Mr. Sutherland called.
Make it Wednesday.</i>

19:03.877 --> 19:05.978
<i>Anson Baer called about tomorrow.</i>

19:06.013 --> 19:07.244
Tomorrow?

19:07.279 --> 19:11.083
- How much longer will this take?
- Not long, you're almost done.

19:11.118 --> 19:14.291
You said that two hours ago.
Put it back until tomorrow.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.954
<i>...following emotional responses.</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:20.436
<i>You have 0.9 seconds
to enter your emotional response.</i>

19:20.759 --> 19:22.829
<i>Reaction time is a factor.</i>

19:25.631 --> 19:28.667
<i>Please make a selection
for the following emotional responses.</i>

19:28.702 --> 19:32.137
<i>You have 0.9 seconds
to enter your emotional response.</i>

19:35.207 --> 19:36.981
Does this thing end?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.992
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- Don't worry.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.530
It's been terrific spending my entire day
with your crack team.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.833
It's all down to this,
an insurance company requirement.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.069
It states you're aware that The Game exists,

20:04.104 --> 20:06.236
that you're willing to participate in it.

20:06.271 --> 20:12.211
Payment is at your brother's discretion,
dependent on your satisfaction.

20:12.246 --> 20:14.680
If I'm not happy, he doesn't have to pay?

20:14.715 --> 20:17.115
We've never had an unsatisfied customer.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.516
I think you mean "dissatisfied. "

20:19.551 --> 20:21.486
That's right.
You're a left-brain word fetishist.

20:21.521 --> 20:25.024
Initials. And sign there. In blood.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.003
Just kidding.

20:28.827 --> 20:32.130
All right, your copy will be at the front desk
in this folder.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.803
And keep the pen. We'll let you know.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.738
<i>Monday or Tuesday?
Both bad.</i>

20:41.773 --> 20:45.015
<i>- How about tonight?
- I'm working all this evening.</i>

20:46.144 --> 20:48.947
<i>Wednesday's the only possibility right now.</i>

20:48.982 --> 20:51.715
<i>You wanna do dinner?
- Okay.</i>

20:51.750 --> 20:54.718
<i>By the way, I went to CRS.</i>

20:54.753 --> 20:56.954
<i>Really? What'd you think?</i>

20:56.989 --> 21:00.190
<i>Well, they seemed
just a little bit disorganized.</i>

21:00.225 --> 21:03.213
<i>When I did it in London,
they'd been around a while.</i>

21:03.248 --> 21:06.201
<i>- Are you gonna do this?
- I haven't decided yet.</i>

21:09.501 --> 21:13.438
It's like getting in on the ground floor
of the next Disneyland.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.441
CRS won't go public.
They're family-owned.

21:17.476 --> 21:21.253
Stranger things have happened.
No, they haven't, actually.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.151
They opened here.
The Game in San Francisco?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.461
See? They're doing fine without any of us.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.028
A scotch and soda.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.746
- Nicholas, how are you?
- James, good evening.

21:36.781 --> 21:39.567
- Got new members here?
- I believe so, sir.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.402
- Put their next round on me.
- Gotcha, sir.

21:46.605 --> 21:51.843
No, no, no. Last time I played Pebble,
I swore I'd never pick up a club again.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.245
Well, speaking about games,

21:55.280 --> 21:58.351
I couldn't help but overhear you talking
about CRS.

22:00.686 --> 22:03.858
The reason I mention it
is I took the test today.

22:03.893 --> 22:07.031
- The Montgomery street office.
- You did? Kudos.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.661
- So yours hasn't started yet?
- Not yet.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.609
That was one of the questions I had for you.
What is it?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.036
- What is it?
- The eternal question.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.703
You know, I envy you.

22:19.738 --> 22:24.209
I wish I could go back
and do it for the first time, all over again.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.818
Here's to new experiences.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.621
Excuse me, I've gotta go. Night, Ted.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.998
- Nicholas.
- Nice to meet you.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.274
- So you played recently?
- About a year ago.

22:46.998 --> 22:49.637
I was working in Los Angeles.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.869
I hear the London office is very good, too.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.884
Sounds like a lot
of fantasy role-playing nonsense.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.646
You wanna know what it is?

23:00.979 --> 23:02.753
What it's all about?

23:03.281 --> 23:06.227
John, chapter 9, verse 25.

23:06.852 --> 23:10.355
I haven't been to Sunday school
in a long time.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.893
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see. "

23:16.628 --> 23:19.802
Good night, Nicholas. Best of luck.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.009
Good night.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.557
If the Baer/Grant meeting

23:40.185 --> 23:42.494
is not held tomorrow,

23:43.221 --> 23:45.667
it may as well not be held at all.

23:47.959 --> 23:51.129
When Mr. Van Orton boards his plane
on the morrow,

23:51.164 --> 23:53.530
he will have every agreement
and addendum,

23:53.565 --> 23:56.767
the complete closing package,
flawlessly revised.

23:56.802 --> 24:00.305
So you'll miss another opera
you would have slept during anyway.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.773
We now have an opportunity
to show our client

24:02.808 --> 24:06.153
how well we will rise
to his exhilarating challenge.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.414
<i>- Yes.
Nicholas Van Orton?</i>

24:10.449 --> 24:13.016
<i>- Who is this?
- This is Cynthia from CRS.</i>

24:13.051 --> 24:16.321
<i>- How did you get this number?
- We've processed your application.</i>

24:16.356 --> 24:19.529
<i>- I'm in a meeting...
- I'm afraid it was rejected.</i>

24:20.525 --> 24:21.625
I beg your pardon?

24:21.660 --> 24:25.095
<i>You shouldn't feel
this reflects negatively on you.</i>

24:25.130 --> 24:28.099
<i>- This is ridiculous.
- Thank you for thinking of CRS.</i>

24:29.601 --> 24:32.604
- Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.844
<i>You may hang up,
or press "pound" for more options.</i>

24:38.879 --> 24:41.654
<i>Oh, this is Conrad, leave a message.</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:46.390
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas.
Give me a ring when you get in.

24:46.618 --> 24:52.357
Oh, regarding your birthday present,
things are a little crazy right now,

24:52.392 --> 24:54.191
I don't know if I can fit it in my schedule.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.571
We'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow.
Thanks. Bye.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.067
Hello?

26:33.291 --> 26:37.762
<i>...resulting rise of unemployment
and decline in viable small businesses.</i>

26:38.296 --> 26:41.299
<i>Meanwhile, Republican leaders argue
that its passage would be</i>

26:41.334 --> 26:44.473
<i>the very stimulant
a sluggish economy needs.</i>

26:45.036 --> 26:48.173
<i>No one has expressed an opinion
as to how it will impact</i>

26:48.208 --> 26:51.207
<i>the pampered existence
of Nicholas Van Orton.</i>

26:51.242 --> 26:54.544
<i>The one thing on which both
Democrats and Republicans agree</i>

26:54.579 --> 26:59.233
<i>is that most Americans harbor
serious doubts about the economic future.</i>

26:59.268 --> 27:03.888
<i>A recent poll suggests a staggering
57% of American workers believe</i>

27:03.923 --> 27:06.791
<i>there is a very real chance
they will be unemployed</i>

27:06.826 --> 27:09.225
<i>within the next five to seven years.</i>

27:09.260 --> 27:13.708
<i>But what does that matter
to a bloated, millionaire fat cat like you?</i>

27:14.833 --> 27:18.935
<i>Stock markets rose
both domestically and abroad</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:21.671
<i>after the announcement
of stronger than expected earnings</i>

27:21.706 --> 27:25.910
<i>by several hi-tech companies,
but dipped again after reports</i>

27:25.945 --> 27:28.515
<i>that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed.</i>

27:31.449 --> 27:35.920
<i>Are you gonna spend the rest of the evening
prying at that clown's mouth?</i>

27:37.122 --> 27:38.288
I... I don't...

27:38.323 --> 27:41.633
<i>It's frustrating for me
if you don't pay attention.</i>

27:42.661 --> 27:44.162
What is this?

27:44.929 --> 27:48.103
<i>This is your game, Nicholas,
and welcome to it.</i>

27:49.534 --> 27:52.571
<i>I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules.</i>

27:53.071 --> 27:56.313
<i>You've received the very first key
and others will follow.</i>

27:56.574 --> 28:00.178
<i>You won't know where you'll find them
or how you'll need to use them,</i>

28:00.213 --> 28:02.123
<i>so keep your eyes open.</i>

28:02.514 --> 28:06.689
<i>- How do you... You can see me?
- Let's save the questions till after.</i>

28:09.287 --> 28:11.027
How does this work?

28:12.657 --> 28:15.899
<i>There's a tiny camera
looking at you right now.</i>

28:17.762 --> 28:20.765
<i>- That's impossible.
- You're right. Impossible.</i>

28:21.132 --> 28:23.976
<i>You're having a conversation
with your television.</i>

28:27.072 --> 28:28.744
<i>It's miniaturized.</i>

28:31.576 --> 28:34.056
<i>Do you know how dangerous that is?</i>

28:38.883 --> 28:40.083
Mr. Van Orton?

28:40.118 --> 28:41.786
<i>And in domestic news, in southern...</i>

28:41.821 --> 28:43.553
Yes, Ilsa, what is it?

28:43.588 --> 28:46.068
- Is everything all right?
- Fine...

28:46.558 --> 28:49.125
<i>...in a petroleum processing
plant yesterday...</i>

28:49.160 --> 28:52.130
I've finished for the evening.
Will you be needing anything else?

28:52.165 --> 28:53.797
No, thank you.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.366
- Good night.
- Good night, then.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.704
<i>...broke out
in a petroleum processing plant yesterday.</i>

28:59.739 --> 29:01.538
<i>Several workers were injured...</i>

29:01.573 --> 29:04.280
<i>- Who's that?
- Never mind who that is.</i>

29:04.676 --> 29:06.611
<i>You wanna know
how a camera got into your home.</i>

29:06.646 --> 29:07.851
Yes, I would.

29:16.221 --> 29:17.324
<i>Cold.</i>

29:19.324 --> 29:20.530
<i>Colder.</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:25.900
<i>Warm.</i>

29:30.602 --> 29:31.842
<i>Warmer.</i>

29:47.819 --> 29:49.457
<i>Write this number down.</i>

29:49.687 --> 29:53.057
<i>It's a 24-hour
Consumer Recreation Services hotline,</i>

29:53.092 --> 29:54.791
<i>for emergencies only.</i>

29:54.826 --> 29:57.695
<i>But don't call asking
what the object of the game is.</i>

29:57.730 --> 30:00.903
<i>Figuring that out is the object of the game.</i>

30:01.332 --> 30:05.280
<i>Good luck,
and congratulations on choosing CRS.</i>

30:05.570 --> 30:09.108
<i>...threatened to have
the American ambassador expelled.</i>

30:09.774 --> 30:13.244
<i>The US State Department responded quickly
with a formal apology,</i>

30:13.279 --> 30:16.748
<i>and announcement
of the ambassador's immediate removal.</i>

30:37.235 --> 30:39.112
Help me out here, huh?

30:39.804 --> 30:41.613
I used to be in Nam.

30:54.452 --> 30:58.161
<i>If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.</i>

32:14.232 --> 32:15.767
May I help you?

32:19.837 --> 32:21.213
What is it?

32:25.410 --> 32:26.513
What?

32:35.753 --> 32:37.095
Thank you.

32:50.501 --> 32:51.570
Bud?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.912
Can you help me out?

32:57.775 --> 33:00.346
I need some toilet paper, I ran out.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.719
Just go into the next stall.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.161
Come on, help me out.

33:10.355 --> 33:14.362
Hello?

33:19.530 --> 33:22.967
- Didn't expect to see you here.
- I wanted to wish you luck.

33:23.002 --> 33:26.337
- You been up all night?
- I checked it. Personally.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.771
I appreciate that.
Go home and get some sleep.

33:28.806 --> 33:31.115
- You sure you don't want me along?
- No, I'll be fine.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.851
Nice shirt.
- Don't ask.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.717
<i>Ciao.</i>

34:01.539 --> 34:03.639
All these years,

34:03.674 --> 34:07.111
the first time ever you step foot
in these offices,

34:07.146 --> 34:09.344
it's to ask me to step down.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.482
You promised to meet
the projections, Anson.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.824
$1.60 a share is what you said.

34:14.252 --> 34:17.289
I don't think this visit comes as a surprise.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.456
- The projections were too optimistic.
- Admittedly, yes.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.781
Our EPS was 150 last quarter.
We are up eight cents per share.

34:23.815 --> 34:27.072
The expectations were ten.
The expectations meant everything.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.569
Will you hold me to it over pennies?

34:30.935 --> 34:33.036
My stock is falling,
I don't know about yours.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.271
Those pennies are costing millions.

34:35.306 --> 34:39.911
Give me next quarter.
If you still feel this way, vote your shares.

34:39.946 --> 34:42.083
Today is what counts, Anson.

34:45.116 --> 34:48.620
You... You intractable son of a bitch.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.072
If your father could see you now.

34:52.108 --> 34:54.524
- What?
- Your father was a friend.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.859
A friend.
God damn it, I watched you grow up.

34:56.893 --> 35:02.600
Because you went fishing with my father,
I should watch you throw my money away?

35:02.635 --> 35:04.079
- I was...
- I'm not finished.

35:04.635 --> 35:08.173
You misspoke before
when you said you're stepping down.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.678
I am firing you.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.453
Action is taken, confidence is restored.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.413
- The stock goes up.
- No.

35:17.448 --> 35:20.155
There's no Baer/Grant Publishing...

35:20.785 --> 35:25.097
No Baer/Grant Publishing
without Anson Baer.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.156
Where's Stewart Grant?

35:27.191 --> 35:30.194
Probably out sailing,
enjoying his golden years,

35:30.229 --> 35:32.970
wondering where the hell you are, Anson.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.506
I'm sorry.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.910
You failed.

35:40.972 --> 35:45.978
I have prepared a severance package
that is more than equitable.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.116
Valid until this evening.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.554
I could fight you on this.

35:55.052 --> 35:59.694
If I leave without your signature,
this agreement begins to disintegrate.

36:00.758 --> 36:06.298
Benefits shrink, options narrow,
and your compensation will be shriveled.

36:12.770 --> 36:16.479
I think it's in your best interest, Anson, to...

36:32.623 --> 36:35.899
Well, I guess this is your lucky day.

36:37.962 --> 36:40.601
My lawyers will be in touch with you.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.432
Excuse me,
has Conrad Van Orton left a message?

37:16.467 --> 37:19.709
- I'll check right away, Mr. Van Orton.
- Thank you.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.249
I'm so sorry. Here.

37:28.646 --> 37:32.750
- Please don't do that.
- I'm so sorry. I wasn't even looking.

37:32.785 --> 37:35.620
- I'm really having a bad day.
- How about a bad month?

37:35.655 --> 37:38.691
You did almost the same thing
to me last week.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.289
- Here.
- Don't do that.

37:40.324 --> 37:43.703
Just get me some napkins
and some soda water.

37:44.028 --> 37:47.907
It looks like the cleaning bill's
gonna be more than the suit.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.671
I don't think so.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.405
- It was an accident, sir.
- Terrific.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.145
I said I was sorry.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.978
- Asshole.
- Christine.

38:02.013 --> 38:06.100
- Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer.
- Fine. Then you kiss his ass.

38:06.135 --> 38:10.187
- Don't you talk to me like that.
- I apologized, I offered to help.

38:10.222 --> 38:12.156
- Clean out your locker.
- What?

38:12.191 --> 38:13.657
You heard me.

38:16.761 --> 38:18.961
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton.

38:18.996 --> 38:22.238
Will this table suit you
for a complimentary meal?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.035
It'll be fine.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.680
- I'll fetch your waiter.
- Thank you.

38:35.546 --> 38:36.922
Check, sir.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.906
Fuck you and your vichyssoise, you little...

39:01.941 --> 39:04.208
Miss? Pardon me, miss.

39:04.243 --> 39:05.908
Great, it's you.

39:05.943 --> 39:10.789
I don't know how this works,
but do you have something for me? I...

39:12.683 --> 39:16.387
- I received this note.
- What are you babbling about, psycho?

39:16.422 --> 39:18.487
I need to know what is going on.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.090
I'm going on my second job this month,

39:21.125 --> 39:23.730
and now it looks
like I'm going on unemployment.

39:24.462 --> 39:28.466
- Maybe I should try to explain...
- Don't explain, just fuck off.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.280
Son of a bitch.

39:33.838 --> 39:37.012
I'm trying to... I am apologizing.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.928
Jesus. What is this?

39:55.960 --> 39:58.060
- What's with him?
- He just fell down.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.664
Sir, can you hear me?
Do you know what to do?

40:00.699 --> 40:02.336
I don't even know if he's breathing.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.682
Move your head. Don't stand there, get help.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.815
Hey, hey. It's okay.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.755
- We're gonna get help.
- How do we know he's real?

40:15.246 --> 40:18.317
There's piss in his pants,
is that real enough for you?

40:19.316 --> 40:22.092
- Holy God.
- He's turning blue.

40:23.487 --> 40:24.897
Police.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.437
- You have to fill these forms out.
- I don't know this man.

40:39.472 --> 40:41.270
I can't get involved.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.672
- I have to detain you.
- Detain me?

40:43.707 --> 40:46.159
- The report's gotta be filled out.
- She can do it.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.612
Ride with your wife,
we'll meet at the hospital.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.350
Two blocks away.

40:50.385 --> 40:52.053
She's not my wife.

40:58.189 --> 41:02.426
This is insane. Ten minutes ago,
I was enjoying a quiet little dinner.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.337
I received this note.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.772
- He's breathing, isn't he?
- Yes.

41:10.807 --> 41:13.213
Is the siren entirely necessary?

41:14.672 --> 41:15.878
Right.

41:27.017 --> 41:30.521
Let's just talk to someone
who can get this over with.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.761
Hang on.

41:32.623 --> 41:35.365
They need your driver's license number.

41:49.273 --> 41:53.548
- Oh, no, you've got to be kidding.
- What is happening?

41:53.583 --> 41:57.823
This is what I was trying to explain to you.
This is a game.

41:59.116 --> 42:00.783
- A what?
- It's a company.

42:00.818 --> 42:04.959
They plan elaborate pranks.
I don't really understand it myself.

42:06.290 --> 42:08.991
What are you talking about? This is a...

42:09.026 --> 42:12.405
The lights, they went out.
A hundred people ran away.

42:13.364 --> 42:17.401
Oh, so you mean the guy who just
pissed himself and turned blue was...

42:17.436 --> 42:19.039
Sorry about that.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.872
You should be.

42:26.143 --> 42:28.213
Why are they involving you?

42:28.913 --> 42:33.589
There's gotta be a fucking flashlight.

42:34.518 --> 42:35.860
Oh, great.

42:41.425 --> 42:44.895
I thought that guy was gonna die.
I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.704
I'll see you around.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.276
- How do you know that's the way?
- I don't.

43:04.014 --> 43:07.393
Where'd you all go,
you motherfucking frat boys?

43:09.920 --> 43:11.592
You'd better hide.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.046
Lobby?

44:17.588 --> 44:21.126
My brother got me this gift certificate
to this company.

44:22.159 --> 44:25.896
Well, I got the key out of the mouth

44:25.931 --> 44:28.899
of this wooden clown.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.577
Never mind.

44:36.073 --> 44:37.813
I don't like this.

44:47.084 --> 44:48.283
No signal.

44:48.318 --> 44:52.391
What is the going rate
for a "trapped-in-the-elevator" adventure?

44:53.424 --> 44:56.158
- Don't even think about it.
- Why not?

44:56.193 --> 45:00.397
Read the sign. "Warning, do not attempt
to open if elevator stops. "

45:00.432 --> 45:04.037
- "Use emergency... "
- "Phone"? If there was one.

45:04.072 --> 45:07.643
"And wait for help. "
So, let's just wait for help.

45:18.582 --> 45:21.722
- Okay, I'll give you a boost.
- You can go first.

45:22.086 --> 45:26.056
This is not gallantry.
If I don't lift you, how will you get up?

45:26.091 --> 45:28.323
I don't know. You pull me up.

45:28.358 --> 45:30.838
- It's easier my way. Step up.
- No.

45:31.195 --> 45:34.141
- Oh, please.
- I'm not wearing any underwear.

45:35.933 --> 45:37.878
Okay? There, I said it.

45:42.773 --> 45:43.910
Okay.

46:00.224 --> 46:03.534
- We can use this like a ladder.
- My hero. Let's go.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.802
I don't think so.

46:11.235 --> 46:12.577
Thank you.

46:20.878 --> 46:22.755
Damn it, my briefoase!

46:26.917 --> 46:28.327
I'll wait.

46:28.952 --> 46:31.329
Not as if anybody could open it.

46:39.229 --> 46:42.464
- Wait a minute. This is CRS.
- What's CRS?

46:42.499 --> 46:46.970
The company I was telling you about,
that gave me the gift certificate.

46:47.005 --> 46:48.915
This is their building.

46:55.779 --> 47:00.193
We'll wait for security to come,
and we'll just explain.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.563
They'll love that! Explain for both of us.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.660
Wait.

47:22.973 --> 47:26.310
We don't want to draw any attention.
We're just out for a stroll.

47:26.345 --> 47:27.511
Run!

47:32.349 --> 47:33.555
We can't fit down there!

47:41.425 --> 47:44.761
Are you trying to ditch me?
- I'm not responsible...

47:44.796 --> 47:45.967
I'm not the one who started running!

47:47.231 --> 47:49.870
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
that started this...

48:06.416 --> 48:07.951
- Get up there!
- I'm going!

48:09.820 --> 48:11.458
Here.

48:12.522 --> 48:14.626
Climb. Climb.

48:24.534 --> 48:27.378
So where's your modesty
around attack dogs?

48:38.715 --> 48:40.956
Shut up! Stupid fucking dogs.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.530
Let me guess. I go first.

48:59.369 --> 49:03.146
- There goes $1,000.
- Your shoes cost $1,000?

49:03.874 --> 49:05.375
That one did.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.250
Here, come on.

49:16.853 --> 49:20.027
Watch out for nails and rats.

49:21.758 --> 49:24.033
There should be a fire escape.

49:44.614 --> 49:46.184
That's classic.

49:47.918 --> 49:49.192
Why me?

49:53.523 --> 49:54.967
Who are you?

49:56.159 --> 49:57.899
Nicholas Van Orton.

49:58.595 --> 50:01.075
What are you, a tsar or something?

50:01.932 --> 50:03.308
All right.

50:04.034 --> 50:07.947
I think, if we drop from here,

50:09.072 --> 50:10.607
the garbage will break our fall.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.278
I think not.

50:12.609 --> 50:14.019
Be careful!

50:19.383 --> 50:21.918
What the fuck are you looking at?

50:21.953 --> 50:24.022
Oh, shit.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.091
Table for two, please.

50:58.288 --> 50:59.554
Where are we going?

50:59.589 --> 51:02.831
That tall, bright building?
It's right near there.

51:08.432 --> 51:10.309
Everything okay, miss?

51:11.034 --> 51:13.446
Yeah. How are you doing?

51:15.005 --> 51:16.984
San Francisco's finest.

51:28.151 --> 51:30.893
Is there some place I could throw this?

51:31.721 --> 51:34.428
There's a waste basket beside the desk.

51:36.526 --> 51:39.871
I think I have a fresh sweatshirt
for you somewhere.

51:40.730 --> 51:42.368
That'd be great.

51:46.736 --> 51:49.744
You know, you've never even asked me
my name.

51:49.779 --> 51:52.752
The maître d' said your name was Christine.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.254
Oh, right.

51:56.346 --> 51:58.553
I guess I'll call you a cab.

52:02.686 --> 52:05.428
- You got a shower in your office?
- Yeah.

52:06.056 --> 52:07.824
You an athlete or something?

52:08.992 --> 52:14.771
No, I'm an investment banker.
I move money from one place to another.

52:18.835 --> 52:21.941
Actually, would you mind
if I just quickly rinsed off?

52:23.273 --> 52:24.308
No.

52:25.742 --> 52:30.588
- Is there a towel I could use?
- Yeah, it's behind the door.

52:31.114 --> 52:33.890
- Oh. I'll just be a second.
- No problem.

52:36.853 --> 52:42.200
Listen, I know the owner of the City Club.
I'd be happy to give him a call if you'd like.

52:42.492 --> 52:45.097
Don't. It was a shitty job anyway.
I overreacted.

52:46.663 --> 52:47.732
I...

52:49.499 --> 52:50.773
I have a confession to make.

52:52.969 --> 52:58.175
Someone gave me 400 bucks
to spill drinks on you as a practical joke.

52:58.210 --> 53:00.642
Really? And what did they say?

53:00.677 --> 53:03.980
They said, "300," I said, "400,"
they said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit. "

53:04.015 --> 53:08.360
I think I said,
"The attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?"

53:34.377 --> 53:38.256
Mr. Van Orton. I was afraid
you weren't going to make it back.

53:46.156 --> 53:48.592
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Van Orton? It's Maria.</i>

53:48.627 --> 53:49.658
<i>I thought I should call.</i>

53:49.693 --> 53:52.460
<i>- What time is it?
- It's 11:00.</i>

53:52.495 --> 53:55.498
<i>I rescheduled your meeting
with Allison and Dietrich.</i>

53:55.533 --> 53:58.033
No, I'll be in there in an hour.

53:58.068 --> 54:02.672
Can you... I left my briefoase
at 1019 Montgomery Street.

54:02.707 --> 54:04.973
Can you check
with Lost and Found, please?

54:05.008 --> 54:08.778
<i>Anson Baer is at the Ritz-Carlton.
He's requesting dinner.</i>

54:08.813 --> 54:10.512
We'll see about that.

54:10.547 --> 54:15.120
<i>And the Hotel Nikko called to say
they have your American Express card.</i>

54:15.385 --> 54:17.592
<i>You left it there last night?</i>

54:18.488 --> 54:20.790
<i>- Should I send someone?
- Give me the number.</i>

54:20.825 --> 54:24.032
<i>- 565-1111.
- I'll call you back.</i>

54:28.365 --> 54:31.032
<i>Hotel Nikko.
- This is Nicholas Van Orton.</i>

54:31.067 --> 54:35.272
<i>- You have my American Express card?
- Yes, everything's in order.</i>

54:35.307 --> 54:37.973
<i>There will be wine and flowers in the room,</i>

54:38.008 --> 54:42.012
<i>and a young woman phoned to say
she's en routo but running late.</i>

54:43.013 --> 54:45.516
Did the young woman leave her name?

54:46.583 --> 54:50.223
<i>- I'm sure I don't know.
- Of course, you don't. Thank you.</i>

55:01.765 --> 55:03.437
Sorry. My fault.

55:10.907 --> 55:13.080
Mr. Van Orton. Welcome back.

55:13.777 --> 55:15.187
Here we go.

55:17.314 --> 55:18.724
Have we met?

55:19.649 --> 55:21.128
I believe so.

55:25.121 --> 55:28.295
If you'll just sign here,
on this signature card.

55:35.398 --> 55:36.774
Thank you.

55:41.671 --> 55:42.911
My key?

55:45.575 --> 55:47.247
Don't I get a key?

55:48.912 --> 55:52.518
- Didn't I give you one last night?
- No, I don't think so.

55:56.219 --> 55:58.164
Cute. That's very cute.

55:58.455 --> 56:00.161
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

56:00.390 --> 56:02.028
Have a nice stay.

57:44.093 --> 57:45.572
Housekeeping.

57:52.902 --> 57:54.813
Could you come back a little later?

58:57.700 --> 58:59.235
Thank you, sir.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.449
Where the fuck is he?

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.310
- Jesus!
- Why are you following me?

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:19.054
What are you talking about?
I'm not following you, I'm just driving.

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:23.871
- Whatever I'm doing is none...
- Is Anson Baer "The Game"?

01:00:23.906 --> 01:00:27.694
- Is that what this is all about?
- Look, buddy, back off, huh?

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.700
Oh, that's cute. That's really cute.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:35.107
I suppose "The Game"
uses real bullets, huh?

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.800
Jesus Christ!

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:43.806
All right, I'm a private investigator.
Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:46.582
Who hired you? Who hired you?

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:59.020
<i>- Mr. Van...
- Maria, get hold of Sutherland.</i>

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:02.365
Have him meet me at the Ritz-Carlton.
I'm on my way.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.948
- What's happened?
- Follow me, Sam.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.221
Nicholas. This is unexpected.

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:36.292
Now, do you really believe that just
because you publish children's books,

01:01:36.327 --> 01:01:38.359
people will care about my reputation?

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:43.099
You can have pictures of me wearing
nipple rings, fucking Captain Kangaroo,

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:45.400
they only care about the stock!

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.937
And whether that stock is up or down!

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:49.370
- Daddy?
- It's all right.

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:55.412
And the fact that you bring Conrad
into this juvenile game is unconscionable.

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.922
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm not finished.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.917
Meet my attorney, Samuel Sutherland.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.521
The two of you have
something to talk about.

01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:07.330
We met this morning.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:10.860
I signed the termination contract
for Baer/Grant.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:13.465
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.909
You were right. I'm going sailing.
You know, sailing.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:24.282
You are welcome to join our luncheon.
Maybe we can straighten this out.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:29.181
You remember my wife, Mary Carol,
and my daughter-in-law, Kaleigh.

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:42.799
Please accept my misguided...

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:59.909
- How concerned should I be?
- It was a misunderstanding.

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.516
It looks a lot like you.

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:07.850
You should see
what they do with the nightly news.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:08.983
What?

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:12.386
- Can I ask you to do me a favor?
- You know you can.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:16.425
Find out about a company called
Consumer Recreation Services.

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:21.165
Sounds like they make tennis racquets.
What do you know?

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.670
Wait a minute. They gave me a waiver.

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.692
- What is this?
- It's a...

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.095
What's...

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.336
I don't believe it. It's invisible ink.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.726
You're joking.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:55.572
I'm being toyed with
by a bunch of depraved children. This...

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:02.340
Are you okay? Tell me not to worry.

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:08.077
You don't have to worry. I promise.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.015
Okay.

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.087
I'll call you later.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.992
Right. Okay, right.

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:25.394
Maria, last night I got a taxi
for a young woman named Christine.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.567
<i>- What's the company we use?
- United?</i>

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.931
<i>- What?
- United Taxi Company.</i>

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:35.575
Call them, find out who the driver was
and where they took her.

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:05.670
Llsa?

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:08.974
Shit!

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.581
I have a gun!

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:57.983
You fuckers.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:03.922
Llsa?

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.356
- Ilsa?
- Mr. Van Orton!

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:08.389
What's happened?

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.958
You haven't seen the house?

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.796
There's been a break-in.
Stay inside. Lock your door.

01:07:13.831 --> 01:07:15.935
Be careful.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.755
<i>911 Emergency.
- I need the police.</i>

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.841
There's been a break-in in my house.

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:27.842
<i>Give me your address.</i>

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:32.314
2210 Broadway.
It's the biggest house on the street.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:35.518
<i>- You said it was a break-in?
- Yes.</i>

01:07:35.553 --> 01:07:37.588
<i>Are you sure they're gone?</i>

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.253
What?

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:42.291
<i>Are you sure
there's not still someone in the house?</i>

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.466
Nickie!

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:49.402
<i>- Sir, are you still there?
- Meet me at your car.</i>

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.235
<i>Sir?</i>

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.210
All right, what happened?

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.921
- Conrad, where are we going?
- Just wait.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.153
What are you doing?

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:16.792
If I can't trust room service in the hotel,
I can't trust the fucking car.

01:08:16.827 --> 01:08:19.100
- Who?
- CRS.

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:21.964
When I think what I almost got you into.

01:08:21.999 --> 01:08:24.398
- What are you saying?
- I'm so fucked!

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:27.685
They just fuck you and they fuck you
and they fuck you.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.939
Then when you think it's over,
the real fucking starts.

01:08:30.975 --> 01:08:32.441
Take a breath.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.288
They won't stop, Nick.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:42.568
I gave them their fucking money.
They won't leave me alone.

01:08:42.603 --> 01:08:46.689
- What are they doing to you?
- I'm a goddamn human pinafa!

01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:49.975
Why do they keep playing
if you already paid?

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:53.229
I don't know.
I paid them more to make it stop.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.341
- They did this.
- It's a flat tire.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.647
- How do you know?
- Get a grip on yourself. We'll figure it out.

01:09:11.682 --> 01:09:13.786
Okay. Okay.

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.871
- The phone doesn't work.
- Really?

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:30.200
- Can you change a tire?
- No. Can you?

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:33.667
I don't think we should be out in the open.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.546
Get the Teletrac.
It's in the glove compartment.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.964
You're with them.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:02.270
- What?
- You're doing this. You're part of it.

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.240
Whose are these?

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.871
Somebody put them in the car.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:14.742
- You're behind it, aren't you?
- You brought them to me.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:19.682
These were in your car!
They were right there in your fucking car!

01:10:19.717 --> 01:10:20.922
Conrad!

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.821
Listen to yourself.

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:32.261
- You won't control this conversation.
- Why would I do what you're describing?

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:34.762
- You resent me.
- Stop being emotional.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.967
- It kills you that I'm living my life.
- Lower your voice!

01:10:38.002 --> 01:10:40.669
You afraid
someone's gonna witness a scene?

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:42.905
- Get back to your house!
- Stop it.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.138
I'm calling the cops.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:48.077
You're afraid someone will see
what a control freak you are.

01:10:48.112 --> 01:10:49.810
What is wrong with you?

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:54.014
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't live up to expectations.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:57.386
- Oh, bullshit.
- I'm not you. I don't wanna be you.

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:59.788
- There you go again.
- I'm your brother.

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:01.689
Pushing the responsibility on me.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:05.127
- I'm your brother!
- All I ever tried to do was help you.

01:11:05.162 --> 01:11:08.364
I don't want your help.
Nobody asked you to play Dad.

01:11:08.399 --> 01:11:11.310
No! You don't say that! Did I have a choice?

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.510
Did I have a choice?

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.261
Conrad!

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:10.257
<i>All I ever tried to do
was help you.</i>

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:12.593
<i>Nobody asked you
to play Dad.</i>

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.463
<i>Did I have a choice?</i>

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:35.386
Taxi!

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.530
2210 Broadway.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:12.028
Hey, buddy, you missed the turn.

01:13:13.455 --> 01:13:17.960
Hey! Do you hear me? You missed the turn...

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.199
Oh, no. No. Stop the car. Stop the car!

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:31.514
Thank you. Open the door.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.110
Unlock the door.
Open the goddamned door!

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:47.689
Listen, I am a very wealthy man

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:52.632
And whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.111
Jesus...

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.492
No!

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.384
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.568
It's a game. If it's a game...

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.811
Here they are.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:57.322
- Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland.
- Tim Foley.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.158
Do you know where we're going?
This way. 14th floor.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.177
Okay, management for
the building says

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:26.847
the space hasn't been officially rented yet.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:31.653
The County Recorder has no listing
for a Consumer Recreation Service

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:33.587
or any derivation thereof.

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:38.458
When the divers find the cab,
they'll pull the plates.

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:42.463
- Have you spoken to your brother?
- He hasn't called me back yet.

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:47.135
- What about the house?
- The graffiti was oil-based.

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:51.371
- Illegal in the States.
- It's not impossible to trace.

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:57.823
The photo, the gun, the clown,
the ambulance, it's all pending.

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:01.014
Breaking and entering, we got solid.

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.069
Malicious mischief,
vandalism and harassment.

01:17:04.104 --> 01:17:07.089
Illegal surveillance,
reckless endangerment...

01:17:07.124 --> 01:17:08.727
Attempted murder.

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:12.363
Except you said you hired these guys.

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.701
- That's irrelevant.
- No, look.

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:19.702
It's our job to tell you what we've got.
So far we don't have a motive.

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.385
What was my father like, Ilsa?

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.382
Why do you ask?

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.194
I don't know.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:40.355
All the time I've known you,
you've never once asked about him.

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:47.472
- I guess he was just on my mind.
- Your mother loved your father very much.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.206
I think he just worked too hard.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.076
Was he...

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.271
Morose? I mean...

01:17:55.637 --> 01:18:00.779
What I remember most was
that his manner was so slight.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:06.848
You could spend time in a room and
not know he'd been there the whole time.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.657
No, what I mean is...

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:12.663
- Before he...
- What happened? No.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.928
Nobody expected it.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.433
I wonder how much of him there is in me.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.367
Not much, I think.

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:29.547
- Was Mother worried about him?
- Nobody ever worried about your father.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.676
Yes.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.913
<i>I found the address from United Taxi.</i>

01:18:37.948 --> 01:18:39.585
Give it to me.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.353
Who are you?

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.957
Christine, is she here?

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.849
She's sleeping.

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.556
Amy, who is it?

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.865
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk?

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.264
Sure.

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.005
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:12.077
- Didn't think I'd see you again.
- What can you tell me about these?

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.451
Is this you?

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:18.790
- Where'd you get them?
- My hotel room.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:23.291
It was in my hotel room.
Are you telling me this is not you?

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:29.057
What makes you think this is me?

01:20:29.092 --> 01:20:31.867
The bra, the red bra.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.964
Okay.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.741
Well, I thought that...

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:44.507
- Can I sit down for a minute?
- Sure.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:47.279
Are you all right?

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.745
You're not all right, are you?

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.386
Is it this contest thing
that you're in still, or...

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.119
I'm sorry. I should go.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:03.033
No, it's okay.
I'll put some clothes on and be right back.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:11.175
Do you have an aspirin?

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:04.279
Can I get you something to drink?

01:23:04.314 --> 01:23:05.689
Is this you?

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:08.987
Oh, yeah, that's First Communion.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:13.286
- Show it to me.
- What's wrong?

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:17.291
Take the picture out of the frame
and show it to me.

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.568
All right.

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:24.199
- They're watching.
- What?

01:23:24.234 --> 01:23:27.509
Not here. They can see.

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.679
The smoke detector.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:39.347
What do you say...
Let's go for a drive or something.

01:23:39.382 --> 01:23:41.815
No, no, no. I am tired of this.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:45.453
- I am goddamn tired of this.
- We'll go for a drink, then.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:46.953
Who do you think you are?

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:50.091
Who do you think you are...
Come on out of there!

01:23:50.126 --> 01:23:52.396
- Nicholas, please!
- Let's go.

01:23:52.431 --> 01:23:54.667
Come out of there right now!

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.114
Now you've done it.

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:22.589
Shit!

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:26.367
- So what are they gonna do?
- Get away from the window.

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.268
What the...

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.880
- What is this?
- Wake up. It's a fucking con.

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.889
Get in!

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:15.844
You all right? Hold on.

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.759
Get out of the car.

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:43.596
- I could've handed you to them.
- Get out of the goddamn car!

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:48.273
You don't have a choice. No one else
is gonna tell you what's going on.

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:06.761
You wanna know?
'Cause if I'm gone, you never will.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:23.171
They didn't take the time
to get the fucking house right.

01:27:23.206 --> 01:27:25.972
- Who are they?
- I don't know. I'm an employee.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:29.177
- Then what good are you?
- Your brother was in on it.

01:27:29.212 --> 01:27:30.243
That's a lie.

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:34.590
Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday.
Connie told you about CRS.

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:40.730
Sorry. It wasn't his fault.
I guess he thought it was his only way out.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.622
They fleeced him real good.

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.297
- How did they get to him?
- Same thing they did to you.

01:27:46.332 --> 01:27:49.937
- What are you talking about?
- You checked your accounts?

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:53.433
I got the number to your modem.

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:56.437
That gave CRS
remote access to your computer.

01:27:56.472 --> 01:27:59.272
- You gave them everything else.
- What?

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.178
You took their tests.
Handwriting, psych info.

01:28:02.213 --> 01:28:05.049
They used it all
to figure out your passwords.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.061
Feingold, the guy who signed you up,
he did five years for hacking Citibank.

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:14.621
They broke into your financial network,

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.524
transferred your holdings
into dummy accounts.

01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:18.560
Overseas operator, please.

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:23.735
- Why else are they shooting at us?
- Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:27.374
Because they're finished with you.

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.572
Alive or dead's the same.

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.840
As long as you disappear.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:42.070
Yes. Blue, 2, backslash,

01:28:42.105 --> 01:28:45.662
9690, D as in David.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.674
That's right.

01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:50.193
The balance?

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:57.438
- That's impossible.
- They already got it, Nicholas.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.574
They got everything.

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.911
<i>This is
the Sutherlands. Please leave a message.</i>

01:29:09.946 --> 01:29:12.412
Sam, I have checked them all.

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:16.690
I don't know how,
but they have drained my accounts.

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:20.520
They're trying to kill me. Call the cops.

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:24.093
I've got one of them right here.
We'll make her testity.

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:29.440
I know how this sounds,
but you call me, on my cellular.

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:31.975
And you be careful.

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.771
He cut your card in half, so...

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.915
My treat.

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.849
You take two sugars, right?

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.358
Never mind.

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:31.392
My name's not Christine. It's...

01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:33.269
Who fucking cares?

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:37.569
It's just money.
You should be glad you're alive.

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.873
I'd rather not talk about it right now.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:46.240
- Someone like you...
- How many times have you done this?

01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:48.982
- What?
- These scams, con games. How many?

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.210
Lots.

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:56.421
Whatever bullshit you pulled in the past,
this is more than just me.

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:59.995
This is pension plans, payrolls.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.962
This is $600 million.

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:19.813
<i>- Yes.
- Nick, it's Sam. I got your message.</i>

01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:21.916
<i>I was disturbed.</i>

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:25.446
<i>- So what are we gonna do?
- I've been on the phone already.</i>

01:31:25.481 --> 01:31:27.789
<i>Nicholas, your funds are intact.</i>

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.938
<i>Nothing's been touched.</i>

01:31:30.973 --> 01:31:33.094
I checked on them myself.

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:35.189
Who is it?
- I made the calls.

01:31:35.224 --> 01:31:36.929
<i>Nothing's changed.</i>

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.967
<i>Not one cent is unaccounted for.</i>

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:41.727
Who is it?

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:46.100
- My attorney says nothing is missing.
- He's in on it.

01:31:46.135 --> 01:31:49.669
<i>Stay where you are until I get there.</i>

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:53.174
<i>- Sutherland's in on it.
- Nicholas, I have another call.</i>

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.821
<i>Give me your precise location.</i>

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.584
<i>Nicholas?</i>

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.460
Gotta get out of here.

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:11.536
How did they get to him?

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:13.769
Why did...

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.673
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:25.776
What do you mean?

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.647
It's out of your hands.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.745
Cellular calls can be intercepted.

01:32:55.169 --> 01:33:00.174
All those calls you made,
B of A, France, Switzerland...

01:33:00.209 --> 01:33:02.278
You were talking to us.

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:07.620
You filled in the blanks,
access codes and passwords.

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:10.555
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:14.326
We have it now so we're done.

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:29.574
Bye, Nicholas.

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:47.113
Embassy? American?

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.751
Thank you.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:57.384
Things have happened and it's important...

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:04.769
No money, no identification, no passport.

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:09.235
What happened to you?

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.568
Where to begin...

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.977
- It's complicated.
- It always is.

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:26.213
I was on holiday alone
and I was robbed by two men...

01:36:26.248 --> 01:36:27.589
Robbed?

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.584
What hotel were you staying at?

01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:33.530
I don't remember. I...

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:37.464
Have you gone to the police?

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.369
I don't speak Spanish.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.364
And I just need enough to get out of here.

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:49.123
We'll help with
the local law enforcement if you want.

01:36:49.158 --> 01:36:52.848
As far as money is concerned,
can I make a suggestion?

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.787
You say you were mugged?

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:58.753
And they didn't take that watch?

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:05.563
How much is a watch like that worth?
A couple of hundred at least.

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:13.730
A man with a watch like that doesn't
necessarily have a passport problem.

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:39.821
Excuse me.

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:43.554
Can I have your attention, please?

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:49.230
Thank you.

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:54.034
Anybody here going to San Francisco?
I need a ride.

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:01.506
I got $18.78...

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.279
For a ride to San Francisco.

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:12.118
Anybody?

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.558
Keep the change.

01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:08.896
Conrad Van Orton.
Could you ring his room, please?

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:11.270
One moment, please.

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:17.142
Is there a problem?

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.038
- You're here for Conrad Van Orton?
- Yes.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:22.144
- I'm the hotel manager.
- Where is my brother?

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:27.349
- Will you come with me?
- Wait a minute. Is there trouble?

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.787
Sir, this is a private matter for you.

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:46.036
There were complaints by other guests,
damage to his room.

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:48.500
We did our best
to accommodate his behavior.

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:53.416
- His behavior?
- There was an incident a few days ago.

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.851
A nervous breakdown, they said.

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.121
The police took him.

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:02.390
They left this address in case anyone came.

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:04.723
It's a hospital in Napa, sir.

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.492
I'm terribly sorry.

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:27.548
<i>Elizabeth,
I need to borrow your car.</i>

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:32.356
Nickie, what happened to you? I mean...

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:37.117
- Look at you.
- What happened? I don't know.

01:42:37.152 --> 01:42:40.521
There's things I have to do
and I need your car.

01:42:40.556 --> 01:42:42.694
Of course you can have it.

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:47.637
Can't I get you something to eat?

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:51.574
You know you're the only person
that I can trust?

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:58.338
Everyone else... If Sam Sutherland calls,
don't tell him you talked to me.

01:42:58.373 --> 01:43:01.250
You lie to him and whatever else happens...

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:06.847
Coffee, English muffin and your water.

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:11.418
This bottle is open.
Who opened this bottle?

01:43:11.453 --> 01:43:13.519
- I opened it.
- I don't want it.

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:17.900
I want an unopened bottle.
I don't want ice, just the glass.

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.165
Please.

01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:27.042
Nickie, talk to me. You're scaring me.

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:33.475
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- I'm sorry, Liz, I don't mean to. I'm sorry.

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:41.918
I've been thinking the last couple of days,
I've had some spare time...

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.888
And I wanted to tell you that...

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:51.699
I understand why you left me.

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:54.938
And I know that I resented it.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.978
I want to apologize to you
for shutting you out...

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:08.410
For not being there.

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:10.375
I hope you can forgive me.

01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:13.213
<i>You're tired.
You've been on the go for days.</i>

01:44:13.248 --> 01:44:14.513
There's nothing to forgive.

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:19.394
<i>Pain sets in.
The onset of a migraine headache.</i>

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:24.066
<i>If this sounds all too familiar,
relief is here at last.</i>

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:26.291
No. You bastards!

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:28.863
<i>Taggarene. For nearly a decade...</i>

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.972
How did you find me here?

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:37.179
<i>Taggarene is strong medicine
for headaches, toothaches...</i>

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.539
He's an actor.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.880
<i>So if you trust your doctor,
trust Taggarene.</i>

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.419
He's an actor on television.

01:44:48.548 --> 01:44:50.493
Some day I'll explain.

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.890
Could I borrow your Yellow Pages?

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:16.384
Okay...

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:19.023
New Moon Cafè.

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:21.219
Best in Chinatown.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:25.919
Get out of the car, fucker.
Open the door and leave it running.

01:45:25.954 --> 01:45:28.954
- You're making a mistake.
- Get out of the car.

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:34.700
- Get the fuck out of the car.
- I am extremely fragile right now.

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:46.909
New Moon Cafè.

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:51.962
- He does commercials.
- You know how many customers we have?

01:45:51.997 --> 01:45:55.684
I know he ordered from you.
It went to Montgomery Street.

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.384
Can anybody help me?

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:03.560
He's an actor, like one of these people
you have up here on your...

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:18.981
Hey, where are you taking my picture?

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:24.178
We were hoping he could audition today.
He would be perfect for this part.

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:29.349
<i>This will break his heart.
- Is there any place to contact him?</i>

01:46:29.384 --> 01:46:33.385
<i>His beeper's here.
He took the kids to the zoo.</i>

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:38.191
<i>- The zoo? That's very sweet. Which zoo?
- The one with the white tiger.</i>

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:44.865
Lionel Fisher, I love your work.

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:51.306
Okay, please, can I... I got my kids.

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.239
Get rid of them.

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:59.018
All right, guys. Snack time.
More snacks. Go, go, go.

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:02.382
Look...

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:05.952
It was just a job. Nothing personal.

01:47:05.987 --> 01:47:08.887
I play my part. Improvise a little.

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:13.200
- It's what I'm good at.
- I need to talk to who's in charge.

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:16.863
Nobody knows. Nobody gets the big picture.

01:47:16.898 --> 01:47:20.232
Tammy, Alex, cut it out!
Why do they do that?

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:24.340
The offices are empty.
I need to find out where they are.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.846
Look, they own the whole building.
They just move from floor to floor.

01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:36.020
And you work for them, right?
You can get me in.

01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:38.950
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:44.291
Tell them the police called. Tell them
I'm gonna blow the whistle on them.

01:47:44.326 --> 01:47:48.204
What whistle? There's no whistle.
This is very dangerous.

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:53.634
I don't think you understand.

01:47:55.569 --> 01:48:01.519
Right now I am extremely dangerous.

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:08.082
Michael, guys, come on, we're leaving.

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:22.538
- Well, we're here.
- Drive in.

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:32.205
What are you gonna do anyway?
You won't get your money back.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:36.153
I don't care about money.
I'm pulling back the curtain.

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.645
I wanna meet the wizard.

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.083
Hey.

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:48.898
- He's eyeing us like Tiffeny Towers.
- Pull in where they won't see you.

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:13.584
Shit. Stay down.

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:22.759
- You're not allowed to be here.
- They called me back. I got a fitting.

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:25.560
He's with me.

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:30.937
- You don't need me.
- Shut up.

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:33.504
Get in there.

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.504
Cuff him to the rail.

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:43.049
What floor?

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.629
You're fucked!

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:08.800
- Where?
- They hired me over the phone.

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:11.738
- Where'd you pick up your checks?
- It was a different floor.

01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:14.608
- Guess.
- This way. Sort of.

01:50:14.643 --> 01:50:16.519
I don't know. I...

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:21.217
Take it easy now.

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.653
This is gonna be a surprise.

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:12.973
Oh, fuck!

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.347
What are you doing here?

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.577
Back from the dead.

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:32.562
Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone.

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.431
Turn around.

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:44.566
You're gonna come with me.

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.903
Everybody, down!

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:09.594
Where are we going?

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:20.172
Stop!

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:32.881
- What do you think you're doing?
- You tell me!

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:36.649
Who's behind this? Who did this to me?

01:52:36.684 --> 01:52:38.518
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

01:52:38.553 --> 01:52:40.520
How deluded can you be?

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:45.632
It could've been any asshole with
a couple of hundred million in the bank.

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:49.996
Get your boss up here.
Tell him I'm gonna shoot someone.

01:52:50.031 --> 01:52:51.696
They won't do it.

01:52:51.731 --> 01:52:55.935
Oh, yes, they will. Get someone up here
because I'm gonna kill you.

01:52:55.970 --> 01:53:00.140
They'll let me die.
You're not in a position to threaten anyone.

01:53:00.175 --> 01:53:02.643
- Where'd you get that?
- What?

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:05.643
That gun. That's not an automatic.

01:53:05.678 --> 01:53:09.649
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd you get the gun?

01:53:09.684 --> 01:53:12.352
- This is my gun.
- We searched the house.

01:53:12.387 --> 01:53:14.822
Well, I guess you missed this.

01:53:14.857 --> 01:53:17.257
We got a real goddamn gun up here.

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:21.628
- This is fake. It's part of your game.
- Don't start with me!

01:53:21.663 --> 01:53:24.564
- Listen to me!
- Don't you fucking start with me!

01:53:24.599 --> 01:53:25.764
This is all the game.

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:29.400
Bullshit. They shot
that guy Feingold, Fisher.

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:34.611
- They killed him. I saw them kill him.
- What did you really see this whole time?

01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:39.814
Special effects. Squibs, like in the movies.
Nicholas, listen!

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.260
He's got a real gun. Okay, I'll put it down!

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:49.721
Fisher's behind that door. He's an actor.

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:52.859
- You're trying to kill me.
- No one's trying to kill you.

01:53:52.894 --> 01:53:55.560
You're about to make a big mistake.

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:58.598
There was a safety net.
The taxi, there was a diver.

01:53:58.633 --> 01:54:01.601
- We were shot at with blanks.
- That's not true.

01:54:01.636 --> 01:54:03.635
It's what you hired us for.

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:08.084
They're waiting on the other side
of that door with champagne.

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:11.454
It's Conrad. Conrad's there!

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:13.479
It's your birthday party.

01:54:13.514 --> 01:54:15.083
You stop lying!

01:54:17.851 --> 01:54:19.455
Let me show you.

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.594
Don't you move.

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:26.295
He's got a gun! Get back from the door!

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.919
You shot him.

01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:52.327
Someone call an ambulance!

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:14.214
He's dead.

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:21.157
We thought you knew.

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:27.954
How did you let this
get so out of hand?

01:55:27.989 --> 01:55:30.934
He wouldn't listen to me.

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:37.240
We went through this over and over.

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:43.434
The mark is your responsibility.

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:48.341
You never, never let the mark take over.

01:55:50.777 --> 01:55:52.256
I'm sorry.

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:58.752
You had a walkie-talkie.
- I used it.

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:07.196
We're going to jail. We're all going to jail
for the rest of our lives.

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.810
Oh, God.

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:21.547
Nicholas!

01:56:56.676 --> 01:57:00.624
<i>We got him. He's in the bag.
He came in right on target.</i>

01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:03.786
<i>Stand by for a further medical.</i>

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:07.659
<i>Keep them back until
we clear away the breakaway glass.</i>

01:57:09.055 --> 01:57:10.855
Don't open your eyes.

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:13.993
This is breakaway glass
but it can still cut you.

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:18.967
I'm just gonna take a look.
I'm gonna check your pulse.

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:26.942
Take it easy. That was quite a fall.

01:57:58.604 --> 01:58:00.515
Happy birthday, Nickie.

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:14.487
What is this?

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:17.525
It's your birthday present.

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:41.015
I had to do something.
You were becoming such an asshole.

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:54.727
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother, Nicholas Van Orton.

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:33.039
Amazing. I just wanted to tell you.

01:59:34.367 --> 01:59:36.346
This was the best ever.

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:42.308
Thank God you jumped. If you didn't,
I was supposed to throw you off.

01:59:44.443 --> 01:59:48.080
We have to head home.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:59:48.115 --> 01:59:51.322
Rachel, sweet dreams.

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:56.729
Thanks, Mel, for coming.
Sorry about your car.

01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:59.736
- I left it at the zoo.
- No problem.

02:00:06.465 --> 02:00:08.638
Happy birthday, Nicholas.

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:13.047
I'll call you. I really will.

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:32.257
Nicholas, I haven't a clue
what this is all about,

02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:35.761
but your taste in champagne is excellent,
as always.

02:00:35.796 --> 02:00:37.900
It was a great entrance.

02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:40.831
I want you to know...

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:45.678
No, please.
I've never been happier in my whole life.

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:49.351
I thank you and my wife thanks you.

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:53.089
Thank you for coming.

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:55.251
Thank you, Sam.

02:00:57.917 --> 02:01:01.159
- What's this?
- This is...

02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:04.359
The bill.

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:07.463
The bill?
- Keep the pen.

02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:11.572
Thank you. Both.

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:20.171
Wanna split it?

02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:23.710
Oh, God, yes, please.
I'll take you up on that.

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:26.647
Oh, my God.

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:32.759
Thank you, Connie.

02:01:36.355 --> 02:01:40.997
What happened to that waitress?
What was her name...

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.727
Christine?

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:47.301
She said something about catching a plane.
I saw her hailing a cab.

02:02:06.452 --> 02:02:07.794
Christine?

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:11.696
I...

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:15.802
- I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
- Well, thank you. I...

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:18.931
I never did ask you your name, did I?

02:02:18.966 --> 02:02:22.640
No. It's Clare.

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:26.203
So you're catching a plane?

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:29.273
Yeah, we have a gig starting
next week in Australia.

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:32.745
- You gonna shear some more sheep?
- Just a walk-on this time.

02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.986
Well, when you get back...

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:40.421
Maybe we could have some dinner.

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:43.866
You don't know anything about me.

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:45.600
No, I don't.

02:02:46.258 --> 02:02:47.825
So you tell me.

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:50.129
- Well...
- Where you're from.

02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.510
Originally? Oklahoma.

02:02:55.368 --> 02:02:56.869
Colorado?

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:02.685
I've been doing this way too long.

02:03:04.877 --> 02:03:06.412
You know...

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:12.824
Would you like to
have a coffee with me at the airport?
