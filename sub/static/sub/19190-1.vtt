01:59.374 --> 02:01.334
Mm. Mm.

02:03.628 --> 02:05.918
Mm.

02:06.464 --> 02:08.934
I had a beautiful dream.

02:10.217 --> 02:13.388
We had two little children.

02:14.764 --> 02:16.434
Twins.

02:18.351 --> 02:21.981
If we have children,
would you like it if they were twins?

02:22.939 --> 02:24.444
Mmm. Mm-hm.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.112
Yeah.

02:26.192 --> 02:27.492
Twins.

02:29.070 --> 02:30.490
Sure, why not?

02:32.365 --> 02:33.865
One for each of us.

02:39.372 --> 02:40.672
Mm.

04:22.809 --> 04:26.399
We have plenty of matches in our house.

04:28.981 --> 04:31.154
We keep them on hand always.

04:36.656 --> 04:39.736
We have plenty of matches in our house.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.750
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:09.438 --> 05:11.027
Hey, man.

05:16.195 --> 05:18.284
We have...

05:18.364 --> 05:20.161
plenty...

05:20.241 --> 05:21.371
of matches

05:22.660 --> 05:24.370
in our house.

05:25.872 --> 05:28.628
We keep them...

05:28.708 --> 05:31.798
on hand always.

05:31.878 --> 05:36.469
Currently, our favourite brand

05:36.549 --> 05:40.599
is... Ohio Blue Tip.

05:42.972 --> 05:46.979
Though we used to... prefer

05:47.059 --> 05:48.849
Diamond brand.

05:50.605 --> 05:52.151
Morning, Donny.

05:52.231 --> 05:53.986
Ready to roll, Paterson?

05:54.066 --> 05:55.112
Yeah.

07:07.056 --> 07:09.346
Yeah, but you gotta know more, tell me.

07:10.977 --> 07:14.859
Well, Hurricane Carter,
he was a famous boxer.

07:14.939 --> 07:18.905
And he lived right back there.
Paterson, baby.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.991
He looked just like
Denzel Washington, too.

07:22.071 --> 07:24.201
They locked him up.

07:24.281 --> 07:25.703
Why'd they lock him up?

07:25.783 --> 07:28.372
They say he shot some people up

07:28.452 --> 07:30.666
with a shotgun in a bar and all that.

07:30.746 --> 07:32.919
I know he didn't do it.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.921
Then they finally let him out, right?

07:35.001 --> 07:38.215
Yo, years later, though. But yeah.

07:38.295 --> 07:40.927
You think before all that,
Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?

07:41.007 --> 07:42.087
I don't know.

07:52.727 --> 07:54.398
What are you gonna be for Halloween?

07:54.478 --> 07:56.609
My mom found this picture on Instagram

07:56.689 --> 08:00.279
of these kids, they were shadows.

08:00.359 --> 08:02.949
So they crept up next to kids, other kids,

08:03.029 --> 08:04.367
and they used to spook 'em out

08:04.447 --> 08:06.494
and look like shadows.

08:06.574 --> 08:08.621
One year, I was actually a subway surfer.

08:08.701 --> 08:10.373
You can buy that one?

08:10.453 --> 08:12.625
Um, no, I built it.

08:29.346 --> 08:30.806
Love Poem.

08:33.267 --> 08:36.315
We have plenty of matches in our house.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.859
We keep them on hand always.

08:38.938 --> 08:41.486
Currently, our favourite brand

08:41.567 --> 08:43.572
is Ohio Blue Tip.

08:43.652 --> 08:45.199
Though we used to prefer

08:45.279 --> 08:47.326
Diamond brand.

08:47.406 --> 08:50.329
That was before...

08:50.409 --> 08:52.206
we discovered

08:52.286 --> 08:55.326
Ohio Blue Tip matches.

08:57.041 --> 08:59.255
They are...

08:59.335 --> 09:02.174
excellently... packaged

09:02.254 --> 09:06.137
sturdy... little...

09:06.217 --> 09:08.014
boxes...

09:08.094 --> 09:10.850
with dark and light blue

09:10.930 --> 09:14.186
and white labels

09:14.266 --> 09:18.149
with words lettered in the shape

09:18.229 --> 09:20.276
of a megaphone,

09:20.356 --> 09:22.319
as if to say

09:22.399 --> 09:25.823
even louder to the world,

09:25.903 --> 09:29.118
"Here is the most...

09:29.198 --> 09:30.870
"beautiful...

09:30.950 --> 09:33.873
"match in the world,

09:33.953 --> 09:37.043

09:37.123 --> 09:39.628

09:39.708 --> 09:42.048

09:42.128 --> 09:44.884

09:44.964 --> 09:48.721
"so sober and furious

09:48.801 --> 09:51.265
"and stubbornly ready

09:51.345 --> 09:53.184
"to burst into flame,

09:53.264 --> 09:56.437

09:56.517 --> 09:58.064

09:58.144 --> 10:00.566

10:14.785 --> 10:16.825
Dante Alighieri.

10:18.122 --> 10:19.502
Italiana.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.346
Because of the bake sale
this weekend, I thought that

11:12.426 --> 11:14.807
if my cupcakes sell really well,

11:14.887 --> 11:17.893
it might be kind of a sign.

11:17.973 --> 11:19.979
Sign of what, honey?

11:20.059 --> 11:22.148
My dream!

11:22.228 --> 11:24.817
To have my own
cupcake business, of course.

11:24.897 --> 11:27.153
Oh, that'd be nice.

11:32.404 --> 11:35.286
- Thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

11:35.366 --> 11:38.289
I made these myself. What do you think?

11:38.369 --> 11:40.541
Oooh, yeah. That's really good.

11:40.621 --> 11:42.710
I painted them.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.630
I like how all the circles are different.

11:48.796 --> 11:51.635
Was your sandwich for lunch okay?

11:51.715 --> 11:54.513
Yeah, it was a really great sandwich.

11:54.593 --> 11:57.183
Good. I'm glad.

12:00.182 --> 12:02.392
Did you get a little writing done?

12:06.063 --> 12:07.693
I did, yeah.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.073
You know, darling,

12:13.153 --> 12:16.869
I really think you should do something
about those beautiful poems.

12:16.949 --> 12:18.871
They should belong to the world, you know?

12:18.951 --> 12:22.082
The world?
Well, now you're trying to scare me.

12:22.162 --> 12:26.086
I am not! I'm serious, you big dumbbell.

12:34.091 --> 12:37.765
Do you think having such wonderful feet
helps you as a bus driver?

12:39.346 --> 12:41.176
Driving that huge machine?

12:42.641 --> 12:44.481
Mmm, yeah, maybe.

12:46.854 --> 12:51.153
Does somebody need Daddy to take them
for their nice little nightly walk?

12:53.819 --> 12:55.950
- Just remember.
- What?

12:56.030 --> 12:58.577
Cupcakes. We could be rich from cupcakes.

12:58.657 --> 12:59.995
Really?

13:00.075 --> 13:01.575
I'm ready for that.

13:10.794 --> 13:11.964
Stop.

13:33.817 --> 13:35.357
Oh, come on, Marvin.

13:45.329 --> 13:46.459
Stay.

13:47.164 --> 13:48.294
Sit!

13:49.416 --> 13:50.496
Stay.

13:53.128 --> 13:54.248
Thank you.

14:14.358 --> 14:17.239
Hey, Paterson. Right on time.

14:17.319 --> 14:19.408
Hey, Doc.

14:19.488 --> 14:21.952
Look what the dog dragged in.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.537
- How you doin', Paterson?
- Sam. Good to see you.

14:23.617 --> 14:25.039
Good to see you.

14:25.119 --> 14:27.166
I don't think you ever met my brother before.

14:27.246 --> 14:28.709
He lives in Philly.

14:28.789 --> 14:32.004
- This is my brother, Dave.
- Oh, wow.

14:32.084 --> 14:34.214
- Uh, nice to meet you.
- You too. You too.

14:34.294 --> 14:36.884
So, uh, Sam and Dave...

14:36.964 --> 14:39.178
Our folks are big soul music fanatics,

14:39.258 --> 14:41.013
so that's, that's their story.

14:41.093 --> 14:42.097
Oh, I see.

14:42.177 --> 14:44.475
And you know that Dave Prater
from the original "Sam and Dave"

14:44.555 --> 14:45.851
used to live right here in Paterson.

14:45.931 --> 14:47.770
- Oh, yeah, I know.
- Got him right here, baby.

14:47.850 --> 14:50.564
On the wall of fame.

14:50.644 --> 14:52.864
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- You too. You too.

14:55.482 --> 14:58.030
Well, Paterson, my friend,

14:58.110 --> 14:59.865
how's life doin' you?

14:59.945 --> 15:03.452
Uh, it's... you know, no complaints. You?

15:03.532 --> 15:06.080
You know. Same old, same old...

15:06.160 --> 15:08.082
Yeah.

15:08.162 --> 15:11.085
Yo, Doc, the Rutgers game is on.

15:11.165 --> 15:12.920
You're never gonna get a damn TV in here?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.296
Hell, no!

15:14.376 --> 15:16.882
Okay, okay, I'm just asking.

15:34.897 --> 15:37.069
I'm getting my ass kicked today.

15:37.149 --> 15:39.321
Who you playing?

15:39.401 --> 15:40.901
Myself.

16:34.623 --> 16:37.463
Mm. Mm.

16:42.756 --> 16:44.716
Mm.

16:46.093 --> 16:47.183
Cold.

16:54.226 --> 16:55.936
You look beautiful.

16:59.106 --> 17:02.571
I was dreaming that
we were in ancient Persia.

17:04.236 --> 17:07.316
And you were riding on an elephant.

17:08.574 --> 17:11.954
A big, silver elephant.

17:12.035 --> 17:14.744
- A silver elephant?
- Yeah.

17:17.249 --> 17:19.378
You looked so beautiful.

17:24.256 --> 17:26.512
Did they have elephants in ancient Persia?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.051
I don't think so.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.259
Not silver ones, anyway.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.440
Mm.

17:55.287 --> 17:58.037
"Here's the most beautiful
match in the world,

18:00.667 --> 18:04.174
"so sober and furious and stubbornly ready

18:04.254 --> 18:05.924
"to burst into flame,

18:07.799 --> 18:12.599
"lighting, perhaps,
the cigarette of the woman you love

18:12.679 --> 18:15.352
"for the first time, and it was never really

18:15.432 --> 18:17.392
"the same after that.

18:20.062 --> 18:22.192
"All this will we give you."

18:24.316 --> 18:26.613
That is what you gave me.

18:26.693 --> 18:29.658
I become the cigarette

18:29.738 --> 18:33.996
and you the match or...

18:34.076 --> 18:38.458
I the match and you the cigarette,

18:38.538 --> 18:42.045
blazing with kisses...

18:42.125 --> 18:45.205
that smoulder toward heaven.

18:47.464 --> 18:48.802
Morning, Donny.

18:48.882 --> 18:50.802
- Ready to roll, Paterson?
- Yeah.

18:55.222 --> 18:57.060
Everything okay?

18:57.140 --> 19:00.188
Well, now that you ask, no, not really.

19:00.268 --> 19:02.149
My kid needs braces on her teeth.

19:02.229 --> 19:03.942
My car needs a transmission job.

19:04.022 --> 19:05.485
My wife wants me to take her to Florida.

19:05.565 --> 19:07.279
But I'm behind on the mortgage payments.

19:07.359 --> 19:08.989
My uncle called from India
and he needs money

19:09.069 --> 19:10.949
for my niece's wedding,
and I got this strange rash

19:11.029 --> 19:13.702
on my back... you name it, brother.

19:13.782 --> 19:16.288
- How 'bout you?
- I'm okay.

19:16.368 --> 19:18.999
- Okay, well, have a nice day.
- Okay, you too.

19:19.079 --> 19:20.619
Yeah. I doubt it.

20:39.659 --> 20:41.790
You know the... that cute little brunette

20:41.870 --> 20:43.333
from the, uh, from the doughnut place?

20:43.413 --> 20:45.210
Yeah, yeah. She's pretty hot.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.337
Yeah. Turns out
she lives in my neighbourhood.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.880
Yeah. The other day,
I come home from work.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.841
I'm, you know, tired,
I'm having a beer, all right?

20:50.921 --> 20:52.426
I hear a knock at the door.

20:52.506 --> 20:55.303
- I open it and it's her!
- Really? Oh, man!

20:55.383 --> 20:57.139
She is all made up,
looking, like, really good.

20:57.219 --> 20:58.515
So what happened?

20:58.595 --> 21:00.225
Well, we just talked there at the door

21:00.305 --> 21:03.353
for like a while, you know,
and she was, like, laughing a lot.

21:03.433 --> 21:07.482
She was, you know,
making eye contact, you know...

21:07.562 --> 21:10.277
- I... She wanted to hang out.
- So then what?

21:10.357 --> 21:13.071
Well, we just, you know, we had,
like, a really nice conversation

21:13.151 --> 21:14.406
and then, you know,

21:14.486 --> 21:17.117
I was really tired and everything.

21:17.197 --> 21:20.245
I hadn't really showered
or anything, so she left.

21:20.325 --> 21:21.413
She left?

21:21.493 --> 21:23.874
Yeah, but you know...

21:23.954 --> 21:25.542
I mean, I know what she wanted. Right?

21:25.622 --> 21:28.628
Yeah. Yeah, for-for sure, Jimmy.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.255
These females are outta control.

21:30.335 --> 21:31.875
- Right.
- You know?

21:36.675 --> 21:37.971
Yeah, yeah.

21:38.051 --> 21:39.591
They're out of control.

21:47.561 --> 21:51.401
Yeah. Well, I had a similar thing
happen last week, man.

21:51.481 --> 21:53.069
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, check this out.

21:53.149 --> 21:55.363
I'm at Larry's barbecue party
on Sunday, right?

21:55.443 --> 21:58.575
- Larry had a barbecue?
- Yeah, the barbecue party.

21:58.655 --> 22:01.620
And, uh, I'm just standing
out there on the deck, right?

22:01.700 --> 22:02.996
And I'd already eaten a lot,

22:03.076 --> 22:04.998
and I'm just having a beer, right?

22:05.078 --> 22:09.127
And you know that blonde friend
of Larry's girlfriend, um, Rita?

22:09.207 --> 22:10.754
- I'm not sure you met her.
- I don't know Rita.

22:10.834 --> 22:13.256
Well, she is, like, super hot! Right?

22:13.336 --> 22:15.008
- Oh, yeah.
- And just like, stacked too.

22:15.088 --> 22:17.677
Just beautiful curves. Like an animal.

22:17.757 --> 22:19.596
And, you know, she comes over to me

22:19.676 --> 22:21.473
and she asks me what I'm doing later!

22:21.553 --> 22:23.892
- All right.
- Yeah, right?

22:23.972 --> 22:25.602
Yeah, so we talk for a little while.

22:25.682 --> 22:28.438
And, uh, she was like,
really flirtatious too, man.

22:28.518 --> 22:29.898
- Okay.
- You know. Yeah.

22:29.978 --> 22:33.109
And finished my beer, and, oh, man, you know,

22:33.189 --> 22:35.195
I had to get up early
for work the next morning

22:35.275 --> 22:36.238
and all that, so...

22:36.318 --> 22:37.489
- You split?
- Yeah.

22:37.569 --> 22:39.241
Yeah.

22:39.321 --> 22:40.992
But it was... it was cool, though.

22:41.072 --> 22:45.997
Uh, I mean, I knew exactly
what she wanted, right.

22:46.077 --> 22:48.957
And I got her number, too.
She gave me her number.

22:49.664 --> 22:52.337
So did you call her?

22:52.417 --> 22:54.548
No, not yet. No. Mm-mm.

22:54.628 --> 22:56.550
No, cos I figured I'd wait a couple of days.

22:56.630 --> 22:57.884
- All right.
- You know.

22:57.964 --> 23:01.221
- Okay.
- But I should call her, though.

23:01.301 --> 23:02.761
- Yeah.
- I should.

23:07.682 --> 23:09.980
You, uh, you workin' late tonight?

23:10.060 --> 23:11.565
Yeah.

23:11.645 --> 23:13.935
- Yeah, I need the overtime.
- Yeah, me too.

24:32.934 --> 24:35.732
Another One.

24:35.812 --> 24:37.943
When you're a child,

24:38.023 --> 24:40.528
you learn there are three dimensions...

24:40.608 --> 24:45.241
height, width and depth.

24:45.321 --> 24:48.078
Like a shoebox.

24:48.158 --> 24:50.538
Then later, you hear

24:50.618 --> 24:53.708
there's a fourth dimension...

24:53.788 --> 24:54.788
time.

24:56.207 --> 24:57.921
Hmm.

24:58.001 --> 24:59.923
Then some say

25:00.003 --> 25:02.509
there can be five...

25:02.589 --> 25:05.509
six, seven...

25:07.218 --> 25:09.474
Are you okay down here, honey?

25:09.554 --> 25:11.935
Uh, yeah.

25:12.015 --> 25:13.515
Yeah, I'm finished for now.

25:38.917 --> 25:40.672
Now, darling...

25:40.752 --> 25:42.757
you have two important things
to talk about before

25:42.837 --> 25:45.051
you and Marvin go out for your walk.

25:45.131 --> 25:47.804
Oh, okay. Two important things.

25:47.884 --> 25:49.931
One's about you and one is about me.

25:50.011 --> 25:52.851
Okay.

25:52.931 --> 25:56.896
One is about your writing,
and you know what it is.

25:56.976 --> 25:58.440
Oh.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.526
Please. Please make some copies.

26:01.606 --> 26:04.779
You know that I know that your
poetry is really, really good.

26:04.859 --> 26:06.614
And that some day, you might just decide

26:06.694 --> 26:08.992
to let the world get to read it.

26:09.072 --> 26:11.036
- Laura, I really don't...
- No.

26:11.116 --> 26:14.873
Look me in the eye for a second.
Look me in the eye.

26:16.037 --> 26:18.077
You are a great poet.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.798
All your poems are still
in that one notebook.

26:23.878 --> 26:24.841
Your secret notebook.

26:24.921 --> 26:26.843
My secret notebook, yeah.

26:26.923 --> 26:29.554
So will you finally just go

26:29.634 --> 26:31.181
to the Xerox place or something?

26:31.261 --> 26:34.017
Please. Just do it.

26:34.097 --> 26:38.480
It would take about ten minutes to make
a copy of your entire secret notebook.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.190
Well, I think it'd take
a little longer than ten minutes.

26:40.270 --> 26:42.776
Okay. Okay. 15 or 20 minutes.

26:42.856 --> 26:44.903
I would even do it for you.

26:44.983 --> 26:48.656
Baby, I've been asking for a year, at least.

26:48.736 --> 26:49.816
Yeah, you have.

26:52.490 --> 26:54.330
Well, maybe I can do it this weekend.

26:56.870 --> 26:58.450
You promise?

27:01.958 --> 27:03.713
Y-Yeah, okay.

27:03.793 --> 27:07.383
Thank you. I'll feel so much better.

27:12.385 --> 27:14.974
What was the...
What was the thing about you?

27:15.054 --> 27:16.684
Well, it's not

27:16.764 --> 27:20.146
as important as that, but...

27:20.226 --> 27:22.482
I've been thinkin' about music lately,

27:22.562 --> 27:25.110
and, and then I saw this guitar

27:25.190 --> 27:28.488
on YouTube that Esteban demonstrates.

27:28.568 --> 27:32.200
And it's in black and white.
It's called the Harlequin.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.203
And it's so fantastic
that I think I really need

27:35.283 --> 27:37.789
to learn to play the guitar.

27:37.869 --> 27:39.707
And it comes with... comes with lessons

27:39.787 --> 27:41.417
and DVDs and instructions,

27:41.497 --> 27:43.753
so in no time at all, I could be playing away

27:43.833 --> 27:46.172
and realising my dream.

27:46.252 --> 27:48.049
I... Which dream is this?

27:48.129 --> 27:51.886
Don't be silly. To be a country singer.

27:51.966 --> 27:55.056
Maybe even a big star,
like one of the greats

27:55.136 --> 27:57.851
like Tammy Wynette

27:57.931 --> 28:00.436
or... or Patsy Cline.

28:00.516 --> 28:03.356
And I can wear black and white

28:03.436 --> 28:06.734
and have my own distinctive style.

28:06.814 --> 28:09.863
I have a very strong visual style,
as you know.

28:09.943 --> 28:11.653
Yes, you... Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

28:13.238 --> 28:14.858
Yeah, definitely.

28:16.699 --> 28:19.122
Well, y-you really need this guitar?

28:19.202 --> 28:22.000
Oh, yes. And they say it's so important

28:22.080 --> 28:24.627
to learn new things as you get older.

28:24.707 --> 28:29.757
And, well, music, you just don't know
where it could lead.

28:29.837 --> 28:34.929
And it's only a few hundred dollars.

28:35.009 --> 28:37.307
I know it's expensive, but we can pay

28:37.387 --> 28:40.427
a little each month
and free two-day shipping.

28:42.016 --> 28:43.730
A few hundred dollars?

28:43.810 --> 28:47.734
It comes with lessons,
instruction books, a tuner

28:47.814 --> 28:52.405
and, um, extra strings
and a hard case and everything.

28:52.485 --> 28:56.025
Well, I think, um, maybe...

29:00.034 --> 29:02.832
Maybe you could be, uh,
a country singer some day.

29:02.912 --> 29:03.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:03.955 --> 29:05.543
I wouldn't put it past you.

29:05.623 --> 29:08.213
Oh, honey, thank you!

29:08.293 --> 29:11.174
Thank you. I love you.

29:13.965 --> 29:18.806
And I love you too, handsome.

29:18.886 --> 29:21.351
Who's going out with Daddy?

29:21.431 --> 29:24.395
Who is my good boy going out with Daddy?

29:24.475 --> 29:26.189
Marvin's going out with Daddy.

29:26.269 --> 29:29.567
Yes. Who is going out with Daddy?

29:29.647 --> 29:32.227
Yes, good boy. Good boy.

29:46.372 --> 29:49.042
Oh, look at that. Look at that right there.

29:51.127 --> 29:53.716
That's cute, right?
That's an actual creature.

30:02.513 --> 30:03.935
Hey, yo!

30:04.015 --> 30:07.272
Yo, my man, let me holler
at you for a minute!

30:07.352 --> 30:09.607
Hey, yo, that's a English bulldog, right?

30:09.687 --> 30:12.026
Uh, yeah.

30:12.106 --> 30:14.779
Yo, I told you, man.
Them dogs are poppin' right now.

30:14.859 --> 30:17.031
Yo, that dog mad expensive, right?

30:17.111 --> 30:19.325
Yeah, well...

30:19.405 --> 30:20.868
expensive to feed.

30:20.948 --> 30:22.120
You hear this guy, yo?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.705
Nah, I feel you, though, but, man,

30:23.785 --> 30:26.624
dogs like that get jacked,
y'know what I mean?

30:26.704 --> 30:29.961
Like, dog-jacked, my G. You feel me?

30:31.084 --> 30:34.094
Oooh, hear that little guy, man?

30:36.172 --> 30:38.011
Dog-jacked?

30:38.091 --> 30:39.762
Well, it gives me something
to look forward to, then, I guess.

30:39.842 --> 30:42.056
All right, money.

30:42.136 --> 30:43.808
Hey, yo, be safe out here, a'right?

30:43.888 --> 30:46.058
And cuff that dog. It's real out here, bro.

30:46.766 --> 30:47.886
All right.

30:57.235 --> 30:59.195
I'm gonna cuff you, Marvin.

31:10.873 --> 31:13.253
Okay, Marvin. Don't get dog-jacked.

31:22.718 --> 31:24.974
Paterson, I got something weird.

31:25.054 --> 31:28.811
- Maybe for the wall. Maybe...
- What's this?

31:28.891 --> 31:31.064
You know this cat? Iggy Pop?

31:31.144 --> 31:33.066
Oh, yeah, Iggy and the Stooges.

31:33.146 --> 31:35.985
"Paterson, New Jersey Teenage Girls' Club

31:36.065 --> 31:39.197
"names singer Iggy Pop world's sexiest man."

31:39.277 --> 31:41.567
- "June, 1970."
- Does it go up?

31:43.531 --> 31:46.162
Uh, yeah. Sure, why not? It's Paterson.

31:46.242 --> 31:47.747
All right.

31:47.827 --> 31:51.407
All right. Iggy Pop on the wall.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.504
- Iggy.
- Hey, Doc?

31:54.584 --> 31:57.882
Who's that, who's that, right next
to Uncle Floyd holding the guitar?

31:57.962 --> 32:00.009
I finally got you. Well, that's new.

32:00.089 --> 32:02.553
But that's Uncle Floyd Vivino's
little brother Jimmy.

32:02.633 --> 32:05.056
He's a band leader
on the Conan O'Brien show.

32:05.136 --> 32:07.096
That's a little past my bedtime.

32:08.556 --> 32:10.603
Hey, Marie. Another ginger ale?

32:10.683 --> 32:13.773
- Thanks, Doc.
- You know Paterson, right?

32:13.853 --> 32:17.026
Umm, not really, but...
we've seen each other.

32:17.106 --> 32:19.737
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey-hey-hey, Marie.

32:19.817 --> 32:22.573
- You drive the bus, right?
- Yeah, I do.

32:22.653 --> 32:25.701
Your name really Paterson,
or they just nickname you that?

32:25.781 --> 32:30.081
Uh, no, my real name is Paterson.

32:30.161 --> 32:31.332
Well, that's kind of crazy, right?

32:31.412 --> 32:33.462
Yeah. Right.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.251
Oh, shit.

32:39.378 --> 32:41.008
Everett still not gettin' it.

32:41.088 --> 32:42.844
Not yet, the numbskull.

32:42.924 --> 32:45.888
I've been breaking up with him
for two weeks now.

32:45.968 --> 32:47.348
What am I gonna do?

32:47.428 --> 32:49.100
Marie, baby, I need to talk to you.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.309
- No!
- Please.

32:50.389 --> 32:51.811
Just talk to me for a few minutes.

32:51.891 --> 32:53.980
No, Everett. We've talked enough.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.150
- More than enough.
- Please.

33:03.236 --> 33:05.316
- Hey, Paterson.
- Hey, Everett.

33:07.657 --> 33:08.817
Thanks, Doc.

33:25.550 --> 33:27.180
Man, what would you do?

33:29.220 --> 33:31.934
You love somebody...

33:32.014 --> 33:35.813
more than anything
in the whole damn world.

33:35.893 --> 33:39.400
You... worship her.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.945
You don't wanna be alive without her

33:43.025 --> 33:47.695
and... she says she doesn't want you.

33:49.365 --> 33:51.235
You're just...

33:53.786 --> 33:55.656
dirt.

34:00.209 --> 34:03.499
Damn, brother. You should be an actor.

34:06.632 --> 34:09.052
I am an actor.

34:19.603 --> 34:24.110
Oh, yeah, that's... that's real funny.

34:24.190 --> 34:28.199
A man dying of heartbreak.
That... that's hilarious.

34:28.279 --> 34:32.949
No. We are sympathetic.

34:34.577 --> 34:38.157
Have another drink, Everett, on the house.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.420
Thanks.

36:05.751 --> 36:06.791
Good morning.

36:17.763 --> 36:20.523
- You up?
- Uh-uh.

36:53.340 --> 36:56.639
Another One.

36:56.719 --> 36:58.349
When you're a child,

36:58.429 --> 37:00.893
you learn there are three dimensions...

37:00.973 --> 37:03.523
height, width, and depth.

37:04.852 --> 37:06.607
Like a shoebox.

37:06.687 --> 37:09.860
Then, later, you hear
there's a fourth dimension...

37:09.940 --> 37:11.820
time.

37:13.861 --> 37:15.366
Hmm...

37:15.446 --> 37:19.866
Then some say
there can be five, six, seven...

37:22.453 --> 37:24.333
I knock off work,

37:24.413 --> 37:27.128
have a beer at the bar.

37:27.208 --> 37:30.498
I look down at the glass and feel glad.

37:56.362 --> 37:58.112
All right, watch out, watch out, watch out...

38:44.493 --> 38:45.873
Poem.

38:45.953 --> 38:47.625
I'm in the house.

38:47.705 --> 38:50.294
It's nice out.

38:50.374 --> 38:51.712
Warm.

38:51.792 --> 38:55.090
Sun on cold snow.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.468
First day of spring

38:57.548 --> 38:59.258
or last of winter.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.890
My legs run up the stairs

39:02.970 --> 39:05.267
and out the door,

39:05.347 --> 39:08.727
my top half here writing.

39:40.591 --> 39:43.597
- Hello, darling!
- Hello, honey.

39:43.677 --> 39:46.307
- I'm painting!
- Hello, Marvin.

39:48.223 --> 39:49.893
I see that.

39:53.979 --> 39:56.019
What do you think?

39:57.775 --> 39:59.815
Doesn't it make everything more
interesting?

40:01.695 --> 40:04.565
- Yeah, it's very interesting.
- How was your day?

40:05.783 --> 40:07.493
Eh, the usual.

40:10.287 --> 40:11.584
Get any writing done?

40:11.664 --> 40:13.584
I did, a little, yeah.

40:16.543 --> 40:18.303
I'm working on a poem for you.

40:21.799 --> 40:24.179
A love poem?

40:24.259 --> 40:27.057
Yeah, I guess if it's for you,
it's a love poem.

40:27.137 --> 40:31.478
It's kind of inspired by our,
uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.

40:31.558 --> 40:32.980
Really?

40:33.060 --> 40:35.232
Does it mention the little megaphone shape

40:35.312 --> 40:36.734
the letters make?

40:36.814 --> 40:39.778
Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.

40:39.858 --> 40:41.864
How beautiful.

40:41.944 --> 40:43.954
I can't wait to read it when it's done.

40:46.490 --> 40:50.039
I also painted new shower curtains.
You should see them.

40:50.119 --> 40:51.659
Oh, okay.

40:54.623 --> 40:56.629
You know what else I did today?

40:56.709 --> 40:58.339
You, uh, planted an unusual

40:58.419 --> 40:59.798
vegetable garden in the back yard?

40:59.878 --> 41:02.551
No, silly! That you have to do in the spring.

41:02.631 --> 41:04.511
- Oh.
- No, I ordered my present

41:04.591 --> 41:06.722
that's from you.

41:06.802 --> 41:08.432
P-present that's from me? What?

41:08.512 --> 41:11.310
The guitar! The Esteban Harlequin model.

41:11.390 --> 41:12.686
- Oh.
- I'm so excited.

41:12.766 --> 41:14.271
It comes in two days.

41:14.351 --> 41:17.274
I didn't get to speak to Esteban
on the phone, though.

41:17.354 --> 41:19.693
Well, I'm sure he's really busy, honey.

41:19.773 --> 41:22.988
Don't make fun of me. Hey, look out, though,

41:23.068 --> 41:25.699
cos Nashville, here I come!

41:25.779 --> 41:27.534
Look out, Nashville!

41:27.614 --> 41:29.453
I'll get dinner ready!

41:29.533 --> 41:31.622
We're having something new!

41:31.702 --> 41:34.291
- What is it?
- Quinoa!

41:34.371 --> 41:37.878
It's like a grain, sort of like couscous,

41:37.958 --> 41:39.380
but different.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.465
I read that it came from the ancient Incas.

41:41.545 --> 41:43.592
A-And it's really good for you.

41:43.672 --> 41:44.882
Oh.

41:48.969 --> 41:51.059
We're having quinoa, Marvin.

41:59.980 --> 42:03.988
# They call me Paul Laurence Dunbar

42:04.068 --> 42:06.573
# Huh, no, they call me
Paul Lawrence Dunbar

42:06.653 --> 42:08.617
# I wear the mask #

42:08.697 --> 42:10.119
Hmm.

42:10.199 --> 42:14.540
No ideas but in things.

42:14.620 --> 42:17.001
# They call me Paul Lawrence Dunbar

42:17.081 --> 42:20.671
# A paradox of stray shots and gun bars

42:20.751 --> 42:24.049
# I shoot the gift, no gun charge, I run yard

42:24.129 --> 42:27.428
# You millionaires get killed here,
I'm slum, dawg

42:27.508 --> 42:29.513
# Who wanna squab? Well, then, en garde

42:29.593 --> 42:31.223
# Just one God

42:31.303 --> 42:34.435
# And I don't spar
with the sub-human or sub-par

42:34.515 --> 42:36.729
# Mmm, see I go hard when it jump off

42:36.809 --> 42:39.982
# KO rappers, a slow rapper get bumped off

42:40.062 --> 42:41.775
# I'm proactive.
Them bad habits done rubbed off

42:41.855 --> 42:43.652
# Now y'all have 'em

42:43.732 --> 42:46.989
# Negroes with attitude,
whole squad is all Madden

42:47.069 --> 42:48.949
# All Madden...

42:49.029 --> 42:50.451
# So Staten

42:50.531 --> 42:51.701
# So... #

42:54.535 --> 42:57.075
Hey, pugsley. What're you lookin' at?

43:00.958 --> 43:04.715
Ah, I'm guessin' this is your human
ball-and-chain, right, pimpin'?

43:04.795 --> 43:05.966
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

43:06.046 --> 43:08.427
but I think it's something really
interesting that you're working on.

43:08.507 --> 43:10.262
Yeah. I'm still workin' on it, you know.

43:10.342 --> 43:13.057
I'm trying to figure out how...
how to spit it out.

43:13.137 --> 43:15.726
But thanks, I really appreciate that.

43:15.806 --> 43:18.353
Your laboratory?

43:18.433 --> 43:21.607
Wherever it hits me is where it's gonna be.

43:21.687 --> 43:24.610
Ah, well, good luck. Thank you.

43:24.690 --> 43:27.529
Yeah. Thank you. Appreciate it.

43:27.609 --> 43:29.531
Later, pimpin'!

43:29.611 --> 43:32.161
A'ight! Peace!

43:40.914 --> 43:43.714
# Just call me Paul Lawrence Dunbar #

43:55.846 --> 43:57.851
All right, sit.

44:35.260 --> 44:37.808
...he comes back with a shotgun.

44:37.888 --> 44:40.185
Now the bear comes over,
taps him on the shoulder,

44:40.265 --> 44:43.522
knocks the shotgun out the way,
and does the same thing.

44:43.602 --> 44:44.982
So he's sittin' like this, look at this bear.

44:45.062 --> 44:47.484
- He does not go back.
- Well, he goes back.

44:47.564 --> 44:50.821
First, he goes out and gets a bazooka,
puts the bazooka on his shoulder.

44:50.901 --> 44:53.073
He walks out there, the bear comes up,

44:53.153 --> 44:56.243
taps him on the shoulders and says...
you don't come here.

46:36.423 --> 46:40.013
I like how you smell
when you come home at night.

46:42.763 --> 46:44.893
- What do I smell like?
- Mmm.

46:46.808 --> 46:49.808
You smell faintly of...

46:51.355 --> 46:53.225
of beer.

47:11.541 --> 47:13.251
Mmm.

49:30.180 --> 49:32.519
How do you say his name again?
It's like Gae-tan...

49:32.599 --> 49:34.771
- It's Gaetano Bresci.
- That sounds interesting.

49:34.851 --> 49:38.024
Yeah, he, um, he co-founded
this anarchist newspaper here

49:38.104 --> 49:40.444
in Paterson, but it was in Italian, um,

49:40.524 --> 49:42.737
called La Questione Sociale.

49:42.817 --> 49:45.157
- La Questione Sociale.
- Yeah.

49:45.237 --> 49:47.492
He was born in Italy, but he lived here.

49:47.572 --> 49:50.120
He was a weaver, an anarchist weaver.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.081
This was in the 1890s.

49:53.161 --> 49:55.375
And at that time in Italy,
people were starving.

49:55.455 --> 49:57.586
When they demonstrated,
this Italian general

49:57.666 --> 50:00.338
had them fired upon with,
like, muskets and cannons,

50:00.418 --> 50:03.133
which, of course,
resulted in a bloody massacre

50:03.213 --> 50:05.260
with, like, a hundred people dead.

50:05.340 --> 50:07.137
Was Gaetano Bresci there?

50:07.217 --> 50:09.139
No, he was here in Paterson.

50:09.219 --> 50:11.433
But when he heard that the King of Italy,

50:11.513 --> 50:13.059
King Umberto the First,

50:13.139 --> 50:14.478
decorated this fucking general

50:14.558 --> 50:16.897
for bravely defending his royal house,

50:16.977 --> 50:18.982
Gaetano Bresci went over to Italy somehow

50:19.062 --> 50:22.319
and he shot Umberto the First
four times with a revolver.

50:22.399 --> 50:24.529
Whoa. Did they kill Bresci?

50:24.609 --> 50:27.824
No, they captured him and they
put him on trial with, like,

50:27.904 --> 50:29.701
a famous anarchist lawyer and everything.

50:29.781 --> 50:31.870
But since there was
no capital punishment in Italy

50:31.950 --> 50:35.916
at that time, like 1900,
I mean... nor is there now.

50:35.996 --> 50:37.459
You can't be a member
of the European Union

50:37.539 --> 50:39.294
if you practise capital
punishment, of course.

50:39.374 --> 50:41.630
- Yeah, not like here.
- Yeah.

50:41.710 --> 50:45.175
Anyway, they sent Gaetano Bresci
to, like, this prison island

50:45.255 --> 50:48.220
where they put all the other anarchists,
and after, like, a year,

50:48.300 --> 50:50.430
he was found dead in his prison cell.

50:50.510 --> 50:52.182
Murdered?

50:52.262 --> 50:54.434
Well, yeah, most likely by the guards.

50:54.514 --> 50:57.479
But, there's a possibility
that he committed suicide.

50:57.559 --> 50:59.689
Whoa, Gaetano Bresci.

51:03.607 --> 51:06.613
Do you think there are any other
anarchists still around in Paterson?

51:06.693 --> 51:10.033
You mean besides us? Not likely.

51:10.113 --> 51:11.493
Hey, what time is your first class?

51:11.573 --> 51:12.994
It's at 10:00.

51:13.074 --> 51:14.994
- Wanna grab a coffee?
- Sure.

51:42.687 --> 51:44.734
Glow.

51:44.814 --> 51:47.112
When I wake up

51:47.192 --> 51:48.863
earlier than you,

51:48.943 --> 51:51.616
and you are turned

51:51.696 --> 51:53.159
to face me,

51:53.239 --> 51:55.036
face on the pillow

51:55.116 --> 51:57.330
and hair spread around,

51:57.410 --> 52:01.126
I take a chance and stare at you,

52:01.206 --> 52:04.087
amazed in love and afraid

52:04.167 --> 52:06.548
that you might open your eyes

52:06.628 --> 52:10.343
and have the daylights scared out of you.

52:10.423 --> 52:13.597
But maybe with the daylights gone,

52:13.677 --> 52:15.515
you'd see how much

52:15.595 --> 52:18.184
my chest and head

52:18.264 --> 52:20.729
implode for you, their voices

52:20.809 --> 52:25.400
trapped inside like unborn children

52:25.480 --> 52:27.694
fearing they will never see

52:27.774 --> 52:30.238
the light of day.

52:30.318 --> 52:32.240
The opening in the wall

52:32.320 --> 52:37.329
now dimly glows, it's rainy, blue and grey.

52:37.409 --> 52:41.207
I tie my shoes and go downstairs

52:41.287 --> 52:43.667
to put the coffee on.

53:53.151 --> 53:54.572
It's all warmed up for you, Donny.

53:54.652 --> 53:56.912
All used up's more like it.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.495
You okay?

54:00.575 --> 54:03.373
Well, since you asked, no, not really.

54:03.453 --> 54:04.666
My mother-in-law is moving in.

54:04.746 --> 54:06.668
The cat got diagnosed with cat diabetes.

54:06.748 --> 54:09.379
And the medicine, you know,
it's all so expensive.

54:09.459 --> 54:11.464
And now, my daughter started
taking violin lessons

54:11.544 --> 54:13.758
and I'm losing my mind
with the sound of that.

54:13.838 --> 54:17.178
What can I say, Paterson?

54:17.258 --> 54:20.181
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, just my burden, I guess.

54:20.261 --> 54:24.018
- My particular burden.
- Okay.

54:24.098 --> 54:25.928
I'll see you tomorrow.

55:00.134 --> 55:03.224
Excuse me. Are you okay here, all alone?

55:03.304 --> 55:06.311
I'm fine. I'm just waiting
for my mom and my sister.

55:06.391 --> 55:08.897
She's upstairs, in that building over there.

55:08.977 --> 55:12.400
Do you mind if I sit down
till your mom comes down?

55:12.480 --> 55:13.818
Sure.

55:13.898 --> 55:15.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:16.985 --> 55:19.616
- Are you a bus driver?
- Yeah.

55:19.696 --> 55:23.661
Do you ever drive
one of those accordion buses?

55:23.741 --> 55:26.451
Articulated.

55:28.413 --> 55:30.585
Accordion.

55:30.665 --> 55:33.129
No, I just drive the regular ones.

55:33.209 --> 55:34.589
Did you ever drive a fire truck?

55:34.669 --> 55:36.925
No, just, uh, buses and cars,

55:37.005 --> 55:42.505
and, uh, I drove a big truck
a few times, but, uh, that's it.

55:52.729 --> 55:56.694
Are you, uh, interested in poetry?

55:56.774 --> 55:58.530
- Uh, actually, I am, kind of.
- Really?

55:58.610 --> 56:01.407
- Yeah.
- I write poetry.

56:01.487 --> 56:03.777
I keep it all in this notebook.

56:05.450 --> 56:06.788
Secret notebook.

56:06.868 --> 56:09.374
- Oh, you're a poet.
- Yeah.

56:09.454 --> 56:11.209
That's great.

56:11.289 --> 56:14.671
- Would you like to hear one?
- Sure, sure.

56:14.751 --> 56:17.882
It doesn't really rhyme, though.

56:17.962 --> 56:19.843
That's okay. I kind of like them
better when they don't.

56:19.923 --> 56:21.469
Yeah, me too.

56:21.549 --> 56:25.723
Okay. This one's called "Water Falls".

56:25.803 --> 56:28.513
Two words, though, like that.

56:31.267 --> 56:33.898
"Water Falls", okay.

56:33.978 --> 56:35.733
Okay.

56:35.813 --> 56:37.527
"Water Falls".

56:37.607 --> 56:39.863
"Water falls from the bright air.

56:39.943 --> 56:42.031
"It falls like hair,

56:42.111 --> 56:45.785
"falling across a young girl's shoulders.

56:45.865 --> 56:47.370
"Water falls,

56:47.450 --> 56:49.873
"making pools in the asphalt,

56:49.953 --> 56:53.960
"dirty mirrors with clouds
and buildings inside.

56:54.040 --> 56:56.254
"It falls on the roof of my house.

56:56.334 --> 56:59.304
"It falls on my mother, and on my hair.

57:00.630 --> 57:03.010
"Most people call it rain."

57:06.135 --> 57:07.974
That's a beautiful poem.

57:08.054 --> 57:10.268
- You really liked it?
- Yeah, I really do.

57:10.348 --> 57:11.686
I think it's beautiful.

57:11.766 --> 57:14.814
"Water Falls". Thank you.

57:14.894 --> 57:17.650
It doesn't rhyme exactly.

57:17.730 --> 57:20.862
No, but the first two lines do,
in a nice way.

57:20.942 --> 57:23.531
And some nice little
internal rhymes too, I think.

57:23.611 --> 57:25.031
Internal rhymes.

57:26.656 --> 57:28.656
Oh, my mom's done.

57:30.076 --> 57:32.406
That's my sister. We're twins.

57:35.707 --> 57:37.837
It was nice to meet you.

57:37.917 --> 57:39.714
Nice to meet you too. Nice to meet a...

57:39.794 --> 57:41.841
nice to meet a real poet.

57:46.759 --> 57:49.432
Do you like Emily Dickinson?

57:49.512 --> 57:52.060
I do, yeah. She's one of my favourites.

57:52.140 --> 57:55.730
Awesome, a bus driver
that likes Emily Dickinson.

58:11.034 --> 58:14.624
"Water falls from the bright air,

58:19.667 --> 58:21.627
"falls like hair,

58:23.671 --> 58:26.341
"falling across a young girl's shoulder."

58:37.769 --> 58:40.689
I'm so excited to see what you'll think.

58:43.983 --> 58:47.782
Some fresh basil.
I grew it myself on the windowsill.

58:47.862 --> 58:49.826
W-we're having pie for dinner?

58:49.906 --> 58:52.829
Yeah, but a dinner pie.

58:52.909 --> 58:54.199
Oh.

58:55.787 --> 58:58.042
What do you think's inside?

58:58.122 --> 59:00.086
Uh, inside the secret pie?

59:00.166 --> 59:03.339
Uh, I don't know. Fish?

59:03.419 --> 59:05.883
No, not fish, silly!

59:05.963 --> 59:08.636
- Want me to tell you?
- Uhh, yes, please.

59:08.716 --> 59:11.097
Okay.

59:11.177 --> 59:13.507
Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.

59:15.890 --> 59:19.647
- Seriously?
- Yeah, baked into a pie.

59:19.727 --> 59:22.400
Doesn't it sound delicious?

59:22.480 --> 59:25.194
You love Brussels sprouts
and you love Cheddar cheese.

59:25.274 --> 59:28.654
I do, yeah. No, that sounds very original.

59:31.322 --> 59:33.036
Is it a new recipe you found?

59:33.116 --> 59:34.871
No, I made it up.

59:34.951 --> 59:36.748
Secret pie.

59:36.828 --> 59:38.750
I made a small one for Marvin.

59:38.830 --> 59:40.501
He really seemed to like it.

59:54.846 --> 59:59.771
Mm-hm, secret pie.

59:59.851 --> 01:00:01.981
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:06.736
Speaking of secret pie,

01:00:06.816 --> 01:00:10.186
I wanted to tell you something
about your secret notebook.

01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:13.576
- What?
- Did you ever hear

01:00:13.656 --> 01:00:16.996
of the old Italian poet
called Pet-ra-rch, is that it?

01:00:17.076 --> 01:00:20.166
Mm, Petrarch. He perfected the sonnet.

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:23.169
Um, I read online that one
of his early books of poems

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:25.046
was called The Secret Book.

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.964
Just like yours.

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:28.508
I didn't know that.

01:00:28.588 --> 01:00:29.842
You read that?

01:00:29.922 --> 01:00:32.053
You just happened upon it online?

01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:34.722
And also that he wrote all his love poems

01:00:34.802 --> 01:00:37.183
to a beautiful girl called,

01:00:37.263 --> 01:00:39.769
ta-dah, Laura.

01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:41.187
That's true.

01:00:41.267 --> 01:00:42.772
So you have many things in common

01:00:42.852 --> 01:00:45.692
with other great and famous poets, you see.

01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:52.071
Do you like it there?
It's the waterfalls, your favourite place.

01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:57.745
I'm not sure.

01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.872
Yeah, it's nice there.

01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:02.667
So remember, you promised
to finally make copies

01:01:02.747 --> 01:01:04.836
of your poems this weekend.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:07.296
I will, as soon as I have some free time.

01:01:07.376 --> 01:01:09.215
You promised me. This weekend.

01:01:09.295 --> 01:01:11.505
I will, no, I promised.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.555
So why don't you recite me something?

01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:19.642
Just a few little lines,
maybe from the love poem.

01:01:19.722 --> 01:01:24.063
Well, I can give you
a few lines I didn't write.

01:01:24.143 --> 01:01:28.151
Are they by your hero,
Carlo William Carlos?

01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:31.070
William Carlos Williams.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.240
I know, darling. I was teasing.

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:39.615
No, it's a poem by a... by a girl I met.

01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:42.874
A girl you met?

01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:44.208
Yeah, no, like a little girl.

01:01:44.288 --> 01:01:46.210
Like a t... like a ten-year-old girl.

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.379
Oh!

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:49.964
She was on the bus?

01:01:50.044 --> 01:01:51.883
No, I met her on my way home from work,

01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:53.843
near the old factories.

01:01:53.923 --> 01:01:58.598
She was waiting for her mom
and her sister and...

01:01:58.678 --> 01:02:00.558
and I noticed she had a notebook of poems,

01:02:00.638 --> 01:02:03.603
and she read one to me.

01:02:03.683 --> 01:02:05.353
From her own secret notebook?

01:02:07.186 --> 01:02:09.025
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:09.105 --> 01:02:11.145
The picture of the falls made me think of it.

01:02:13.442 --> 01:02:15.531
I just remember how it started.

01:02:15.611 --> 01:02:17.911
"Water falls from the bright air,

01:02:19.448 --> 01:02:20.908
"falls like hair,

01:02:22.785 --> 01:02:24.945
"falling across a young girl's shoulders."

01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:29.712
Nice.

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.672
Almost like one of yours.

01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:36.677
Did she have long hair?

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:38.763
Uh, she did, yeah.

01:02:38.843 --> 01:02:40.473
Hmm.

01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.938
Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?

01:02:47.018 --> 01:02:49.732
For my cupcakes, remember?

01:02:49.812 --> 01:02:51.901
Saturday is my turn on the baking booth

01:02:51.981 --> 01:02:53.778
in the farmer's market.

01:02:53.858 --> 01:02:55.613
I remembered this morning that,
oh, my God,

01:02:55.693 --> 01:02:57.573
it's the day after tomorrow.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.700
I have so many cupcakes to make. Oh, my!

01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:08.785
- You don't like your pie?
- No, I do, yeah!

01:03:42.948 --> 01:03:45.621
Our own Romeo and Juliet.

01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:48.958
Or, maybe, more like Antony and Cleopatra?

01:03:49.038 --> 01:03:51.043
Speaking of Romeo and Juliet,

01:03:51.123 --> 01:03:52.673
Abbott and Costello.

01:03:54.043 --> 01:03:56.716
Look, Lou Costello has got to be

01:03:56.796 --> 01:03:58.718
the most famous person from Paterson.

01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:01.846
Yeah, probably, yeah. I mean, he...

01:04:01.926 --> 01:04:04.890
he's got that statue
and he's got his own park.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.892
Right, I mean,
Alexander Hamilton has a statue,

01:04:06.972 --> 01:04:10.438
others got statues but not their own park!

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:12.690
Hell, even Fetty Wap don't have no park.

01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:17.781
Yeah, Lou Costello.

01:04:21.028 --> 01:04:22.783
I wonder where Bud Abbott was born?

01:04:22.863 --> 01:04:25.077
Uhh, that I know.

01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.245
Jersey, also.

01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:29.165
Asbury Park. Uh, 1895, maybe.

01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:31.334
- You knew that?
- Oh, hell, yeah, man.

01:04:31.414 --> 01:04:32.918
I know a lot of shit about a lot of shit.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.756
And Lou Costello.

01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:38.799
- "Who's on first?"
- Uh, who's on first,

01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:40.468
what's on second,

01:04:40.548 --> 01:04:43.088
- I don't know's on third...
- Wait, who's on first?

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.141
Who's on first?

01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:50.019
Who's on first?

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:51.937
I'll tell ya who's on first.

01:04:52.017 --> 01:04:54.065
And I'll tell ya what's on second too.

01:04:54.145 --> 01:04:55.941
But you ain't gonna wanna know.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:57.234
I can explain, sweetheart.

01:04:57.314 --> 01:04:59.695
No, let me explain.

01:04:59.775 --> 01:05:02.448
That is my cookie jar money.

01:05:02.528 --> 01:05:04.700
That is money I've been saving up

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.704
so I could get my hair fixed to
go to your damn niece's wedding.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:11.374
That is my money. Mine!

01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:13.501
I promise, I will replace it.

01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:17.421
I will replace it after
this weekend's chess tournament.

01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:21.008
Chess tournament?

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:24.804
Doc, you gonna need a chess tourniquet

01:05:24.884 --> 01:05:27.094
if you don't put that damn money back.

01:05:54.246 --> 01:05:55.746
You okay, Doc?

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:01.298
Paterson, you still don't got a cell phone?

01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:03.217
Uh, no... no, I don't want one.

01:06:03.297 --> 01:06:04.468
It would be a leash.

01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:06.637
What about the better half? She got one?

01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:10.349
She's got one, yeah.
And a laptop. And an iPad.

01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:12.101
She doesn't want you to get one?

01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:18.021
No, no, she's okay about it.

01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:22.483
She understands me really well.

01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:26.862
Lucky guy.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.915
You don't listen to me at all!

01:06:34.995 --> 01:06:38.169
The friendship can be folded
into something greater.

01:06:38.249 --> 01:06:40.289
I don't want to fold it
into something greater!

01:06:44.046 --> 01:06:46.135
Hey, Doc, what d...
what does Abbott and Costello

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:48.255
have to do with, uh, Romeo and Juliet?

01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:53.100
- Wait, wait, wait, please.
- Everett!

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.140
I would rather drop dead.

01:07:16.662 --> 01:07:18.584
Is there anything we can do?

01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:22.588
Nah, I always say,
don't try to change things,

01:07:22.668 --> 01:07:25.338
or you'll make them even worse.

01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:10.511
- Good morning!
- Morning.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.895
You're up late, honey.

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:22.606
Your silent, magic watch
didn't wake you up.

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:25.568
Yeah, it was a little late today.

01:08:25.648 --> 01:08:29.446
Well, some days, something inside
just doesn't wanna get up.

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:30.935
Ever feel like that?

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:34.026
Today.

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:38.243
Oh, my. I have so much to do.

01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:41.917
I know it's silly, but I'm so excited

01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:44.295
about the new farmer's market.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:47.256
Because if my cupcakes
are a big sensation,

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:50.884
then I might be on my way
to a very successful business.

01:08:50.964 --> 01:08:54.220
That would be amazing, honey.

01:08:54.301 --> 01:08:56.140
And you know what else?

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.392
My guitar should arrive today.

01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:01.812
My Harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban.

01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:07.109
Is Esteban gonna deliver it personally?

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.484
Who knows?

01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:15.241
Mmm, smells good.

01:09:23.413 --> 01:09:25.334
I like your technique.

01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:51.645
The Run.

01:10:00.242 --> 01:10:03.624
I go through

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:06.624
trillions of molecules

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:11.131
that move aside

01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:14.131
to make way for me,

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.180
while on both sides,

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.600
trillions more

01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:23.386
stay where they are.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:27.064
The windshield wiper blade

01:10:27.144 --> 01:10:29.404
starts to squeak.

01:10:30.773 --> 01:10:32.733
The rain has stopped.

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:35.488
I stop.

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:44.415
Morning, Donny.

01:10:44.495 --> 01:10:45.582
You okay?

01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:47.332
No, not really.

01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.536
You don't even wanna know.

01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:34.673
I go through trillions of molecules

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:36.133
that move aside

01:11:36.213 --> 01:11:37.968
to make way for me,

01:11:38.048 --> 01:11:39.511
while on both sides,

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:41.430
trillions more

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.349
stay where they are.

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:47.519
The windshield wiper blade
starts to squeak.

01:11:49.643 --> 01:11:51.899
The rain has stopped.

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:54.109
I stop.

01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:55.778
On the corner,

01:11:55.858 --> 01:11:58.405
a boy in a yellow raincoat

01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:00.565
holding his mother's hand.

01:14:04.945 --> 01:14:06.533
I think it's probably best if we, uh,

01:14:06.613 --> 01:14:09.620
stand as far away from the bus as we can.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.247
It's not gonna catch
on fire or anything, is it?

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.291
It could explode into a fireball!

01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:16.585
Oh, no, ma'am.
It's just an electrical problem.

01:14:16.665 --> 01:14:18.295
What's gonna happen to us now?

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:19.880
Are we stranded here?

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.216
Oh, no, no, no.
Another bus will come get us shortly.

01:14:23.296 --> 01:14:25.256
Dear God.

01:14:31.888 --> 01:14:35.062
I think we'll just gather up over there,
if you don't mind, thank you very much.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:39.650
Okay, people. Let's join the rest
of the passengers, if we could.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.610
- Did we run out of gas?
- No, plenty of gas.

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:44.071
It's just, uh, an electrical problem.

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.865
Sabotage, probably.

01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:49.826
Okay, let's... let's come over here.

01:14:49.906 --> 01:14:51.662
Another bus will come get us in a minute.

01:14:51.742 --> 01:14:55.832
Okay everyone, I... I apologise
again for this inconvenience.

01:14:55.912 --> 01:14:57.751
I think it's best if we wait
here for a few minutes

01:14:57.831 --> 01:15:01.961
and, uh, I'll call now for a replacement bus.

01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:09.846
- Don't you have a smartphone?
- Uh, no, I don't.

01:15:09.926 --> 01:15:11.306
I don't, not with me.

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:13.183
Would you like to use my phone,
Mr Bus Driver?

01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:15.727
Oh, if you don't mind. Thank you.

01:15:15.807 --> 01:15:17.562
So, what's gonna happen to this bus?

01:15:17.642 --> 01:15:20.732
Um, well, a... a big truck is gonna come

01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:22.275
and tow it back to the depot.

01:15:22.355 --> 01:15:24.319
- Awesome.
- Thank you very much.

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:25.821
- I can't wait to see the truck.
- Okay, I'll just be over here.

01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:27.155
I apologise again.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:46.299
Hi, this is Paterson, bus 23,
I have a situation.

01:15:46.379 --> 01:15:48.010
Third, second and first.

01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:51.346
Third, second, first.

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:53.807
Pluck all those strings together.

01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:55.177
There you have your first chord.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.880
Surprise!

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.840
Just sit down, darling,
for a second, and listen to this.

01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:54.381
Okay.

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:09.985
# I've been working on the railroad

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:14.281
# All the livelong day

01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:18.160
# I've been working on the railroad

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:22.490
# Just to pass the time away #

01:18:24.287 --> 01:18:27.961
Well, that's as far as I got so far.

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.504
But it's pretty amazing, right?

01:18:29.584 --> 01:18:30.839
For someone who never played before?

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.465
It's very amazing.

01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:34.009
You just learned all that today?

01:18:34.089 --> 01:18:37.179
Yeah, from these instructional DVDs.

01:18:37.259 --> 01:18:39.848
And I've been baking all day too.

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:41.641
Well, I'm very impressed.

01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:43.185
Isn't she beautiful?

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:46.021
Yeah, you two were made for each other.

01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.690
What's it called again? The... the Jester?

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.026
- No, the Harlequin.
- Harlequin.

01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:53.016
And thank you, my love.

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:58.742
You look a little drained.

01:18:58.822 --> 01:19:00.160
You're home a little late.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.120
Was your day okay?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.706
Well, it was until the bus broke down.

01:19:04.786 --> 01:19:07.083
The bus broke down? Was it dangerous?

01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:10.378
No, it was just, uh, just sputtered out.

01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:12.172
It was an electrical problem.

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:14.174
Electrical problem?

01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:16.885
Could it have exploded into a fireball?

01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:19.304
No, no.

01:19:19.384 --> 01:19:21.598
It's just an old bus.

01:19:21.678 --> 01:19:23.516
Well, I think they should get
their best driver,

01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:25.727
who's also a great poet, a brand-new bus.

01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:27.103
It's the least they could do.

01:19:27.183 --> 01:19:28.897
The city of Paterson?

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:30.347
Not likely.

01:19:31.938 --> 01:19:33.898
Well, honey. I'm just glad you're okay.

01:19:37.068 --> 01:19:38.823
Maybe you should get a smartphone.

01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:40.242
Just for emergencies.

01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:42.244
You know I don't want one.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:45.163
The world worked fine
before they even existed.

01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:48.503
I know, darling, but sometimes
they make things easier.

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:52.462
Honey, since the kitchen's a mess

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:55.131
with all my baking going on,
couldn't we order out?

01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:57.384
Like, a pizza?

01:19:57.464 --> 01:20:00.679
- Pizza's fine with me.
- Great.

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:03.098
Then after dinner,
while you and Marvin go out,

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:05.684
I could practise just a little more.

01:20:05.764 --> 01:20:08.184
I wanna learn the rest
of that song, at least.

01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:31.123
The Harlequin.

01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:49.269
So what'd they do?
Send a mechanic, uh, on site

01:20:49.349 --> 01:20:50.979
or tow the motherfucker or what?

01:20:51.059 --> 01:20:53.231
Yeah, yeah. They come
and tow it back to the depot,

01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:55.984
and they send a replacement bus
for the passengers.

01:20:56.064 --> 01:20:57.861
Man, that could've been a lot worse.

01:20:57.941 --> 01:21:00.405
Damn thing could've exploded
into a fuckin' fireball!

01:21:07.575 --> 01:21:09.998
Hey, Doc, if you're not
doing anything tomorrow,

01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:12.167
they're having the new outdoor
farmer's market again.

01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:14.794
And I know for a fact there's gonna be

01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:19.132
some fantastic cupcakes
for sale in the bakery booth.

01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:23.720
Oh, tomorrow's, uh... tomorrow's Saturday.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.973
I got that big chess tournament
goin' on over there in Camden.

01:21:27.053 --> 01:21:29.184
Oh, right, right.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.353
Okay, well, good luck.

01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:33.271
Yeah, thanks.

01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:34.856
Hey, fellas.

01:21:34.936 --> 01:21:36.941
- Hey, Marie.
- Hey, shortie.

01:21:37.021 --> 01:21:39.110
How you and, uh, Romeo doin'?

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:41.196
Please, Everett!

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.822
And we're not doing.

01:21:42.902 --> 01:21:44.783
If anything, he's acting worse.

01:21:44.863 --> 01:21:47.243
But I think the key word is acting.

01:21:47.323 --> 01:21:51.081
Well, how well do you really know him?

01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.749
We've known each other since we were kids.

01:21:52.829 --> 01:21:53.833
And I really do care about him.

01:21:53.913 --> 01:21:55.335
It's just...

01:21:55.415 --> 01:21:57.253
this whole girlfriend thing
was a big mistake.

01:21:57.333 --> 01:21:59.672
Obviously.

01:21:59.752 --> 01:22:02.217
It's cool. He just needs to act out.

01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:04.344
He's always been that way.
He needed some kind of drama,

01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:05.720
and then he gets over it.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.722
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

01:22:07.802 --> 01:22:09.516
If you ask me, everything he does is crazy.

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:14.854
Speak of the devil.

01:22:14.934 --> 01:22:17.148
Baby, I need to talk to you for a minute.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:19.025
Everett, why can't you
just forget about me?

01:22:19.105 --> 01:22:22.225
- Because I am in love with you.
- Well, you can't have me.

01:22:28.865 --> 01:22:30.275
Okay.

01:22:34.078 --> 01:22:35.958
Okay.

01:22:40.835 --> 01:22:43.875
Okay, then nobody move!

01:22:51.429 --> 01:22:53.935
If I can't have you, then I guess nobody can.

01:22:54.015 --> 01:22:55.437
Everett.

01:22:55.517 --> 01:22:56.855
Stop acting crazy.

01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:59.399
Crazy? You wanna see crazy?

01:22:59.479 --> 01:23:01.649
I'll show y'all crazy!

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:09.452
Smooth move, Paterson.

01:23:15.662 --> 01:23:17.625
You damn chucklehead.

01:23:17.705 --> 01:23:19.878
Comin' in here. Clearin' out my place.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:23.338
I oughta kick your black ass.

01:23:39.894 --> 01:23:42.984
Without love,

01:23:43.064 --> 01:23:45.944
what reason is there for anything?

01:23:57.996 --> 01:24:00.710
Thanks, Paterson.

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:02.962
That was very heroic.

01:24:03.042 --> 01:24:04.547
Yeah, wow. Okay.

01:24:04.627 --> 01:24:05.965
I don't know.

01:24:06.045 --> 01:24:07.800
If it wasn't for you,

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.638
crazy motherfucker might have shot
himself to death with a piece of foam.

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:45.955
Good morning.

01:24:48.921 --> 01:24:50.343
What time is it?

01:24:50.423 --> 01:24:52.883
- It's Saturday morning, baby.
- Oh.

01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:57.225
You were out a little late last night.

01:24:57.305 --> 01:25:00.144
Yeah.

01:25:00.224 --> 01:25:03.144
There was, umm...

01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:07.860
an incident at the... at the bar.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.739
Incident at the bar? What happened?

01:25:11.819 --> 01:25:13.700
Well...

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.577
- Oh, a guy had a gun.
- What?

01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:17.537
Well, he had what I thought was a real gun.

01:25:17.617 --> 01:25:19.080
And he threatened this girl and...

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.915
Oh, my God! He threatened a girl?

01:25:20.995 --> 01:25:22.709
He threatened to shoot himself.

01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:25.295
All because he's in love with her.

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:28.298
It's complicated. Anyway, I tried to stop him
and I knocked the gun away

01:25:28.378 --> 01:25:30.758
and turns out it was a toy gun

01:25:30.838 --> 01:25:32.378
that shoots little foam pellets.

01:25:34.717 --> 01:25:36.639
Sure looked real, though.

01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:38.725
Oh, honey.

01:25:38.805 --> 01:25:42.020
Oh, that's so frightening.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.600
You acted so heroically.

01:25:48.523 --> 01:25:50.987
I told you that place could be dangerous.

01:25:51.067 --> 01:25:53.823
I mean, anyone could
just walk in there any time

01:25:53.903 --> 01:25:55.658
with a shotgun or something.

01:25:55.738 --> 01:25:56.951
Now you see what I mean?

01:25:57.031 --> 01:25:58.828
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:58.908 --> 01:26:01.328
But it was only... it was only a toy gun.

01:26:02.995 --> 01:26:04.751
Why are you up already?

01:26:04.831 --> 01:26:06.586
It's Saturday.

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:09.505
I have to get my cupcakes
to the farmer's market.

01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:11.705
- Remember?
- I do now.

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.430
I smell cupcakes.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.060
Mmm, still smell a hint of beer.

01:26:45.079 --> 01:26:46.459
Wow!

01:26:46.539 --> 01:26:48.753
This looks fantastic, baby.

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:51.343
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:26:56.424 --> 01:26:58.763
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair?

01:26:58.843 --> 01:27:00.603
Who's sitting in Daddy's chair, huh?

01:27:04.098 --> 01:27:05.812
William Carlos Williams?

01:27:05.892 --> 01:27:08.602
Oh, no, uh, Carlo William Carlos.

01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:14.153
Will you read me that one I love so much?

01:27:14.233 --> 01:27:17.401
"This Is Just To Say"? Comin' up.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.700
"This is just to say

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.671
"I have eaten the plums
that were in the icebox

01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:35.341
"and which you were probably
saving for breakfast.

01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:37.552
"Forgive me.

01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:40.346
"They were delicious,

01:27:40.426 --> 01:27:44.350
"so sweet and so cold."

01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:47.729
- Oh, I love that poem.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

01:27:47.809 --> 01:27:49.897
And some of yours are just as good.

01:27:49.977 --> 01:27:51.147
Well...

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.487
Now, remember your promise.

01:27:56.567 --> 01:27:58.114
I promised.

01:27:58.194 --> 01:27:59.657
I better get going.

01:27:59.737 --> 01:28:02.368
Could you put the rest in the boxes?

01:28:02.448 --> 01:28:03.738
Sure.

01:28:25.513 --> 01:28:26.893
Okay.

01:28:26.973 --> 01:28:28.436
This is the last of 'em.

01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:29.771
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

01:28:29.851 --> 01:28:32.064
All together like this, they look great.

01:28:32.144 --> 01:28:35.151
- I'm so excited.
- Good.

01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:37.236
Okay, they should be good,
if you just drive slowly.

01:28:37.316 --> 01:28:38.896
Yeah, yeah. I... I will.

01:28:44.782 --> 01:28:48.748
- You're not taking him with you?
- Oh, honey, I can't.

01:28:48.828 --> 01:28:51.208
Maybe you could take him
for a walk later, huh?

01:28:52.915 --> 01:28:54.754
Love you.

01:28:54.834 --> 01:28:55.844
Yeah, love you.

01:29:15.897 --> 01:29:17.317
All right. Come on, Marvin.

01:29:37.585 --> 01:29:39.665
Come on, Marvin.
Can't we stop here for a second?

01:29:52.141 --> 01:29:54.146
Pumpkin

01:29:54.226 --> 01:29:57.024
My little pumpkin,

01:29:57.104 --> 01:30:02.494
I like to think about other girls sometimes,

01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:05.408
but

01:30:05.488 --> 01:30:07.827
the truth is

01:30:07.907 --> 01:30:11.867
if you ever left me,

01:30:15.373 --> 01:30:19.543
I'd tear my heart out

01:30:22.588 --> 01:30:25.628
and never put it back.

01:30:27.927 --> 01:30:32.257
There'll never be anyone like you.

01:30:33.933 --> 01:30:36.814
How embarrassing.

01:30:45.611 --> 01:30:47.821
- Honey?
- Down here.

01:30:52.952 --> 01:30:56.002
- How'd it go?
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy!

01:30:57.832 --> 01:31:02.089
You won't believe this, but I made $286.

01:31:02.169 --> 01:31:03.549
Wow.

01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:05.217
My cupcakes were a huge hit.

01:31:05.297 --> 01:31:06.636
Everyone's talking about them.

01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:08.346
That's fantastic.

01:31:09.677 --> 01:31:11.347
Marvin!

01:31:28.696 --> 01:31:31.702
$286 cash money, baby.

01:31:31.782 --> 01:31:33.496
Wow!

01:31:33.576 --> 01:31:36.165
I know it's no big deal.
It's just silly cupcakes.

01:31:36.245 --> 01:31:37.875
But I'm quite proud of myself.

01:31:37.955 --> 01:31:39.752
Oh, yeah, you should be.

01:31:39.832 --> 01:31:41.337
Can we celebrate?

01:31:41.417 --> 01:31:43.756
Uh, yeah, sure. What should we do?

01:31:43.836 --> 01:31:46.509
- First of all, I'm gonna treat.
- Okay.

01:31:46.589 --> 01:31:49.178
I'd like to go to dinner
and then go to the movies.

01:31:49.258 --> 01:31:52.723
We haven't gone to the movies in so long.

01:31:52.803 --> 01:31:55.351
Uh, yeah, no... no we haven't.
What should we see?

01:31:55.431 --> 01:31:57.061
You know that one theatre at the mall

01:31:57.141 --> 01:31:59.981
now shows old scary movies
on Saturday nights?

01:32:00.061 --> 01:32:01.649
We could see an old scary movie.

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:03.484
I'm gonna get changed and get ready.

01:32:03.564 --> 01:32:04.694
I'm very proud of you.

01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:09.490
And you, my little man.

01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:12.990
You're gonna have to stay here
and guard the palace.

01:32:19.497 --> 01:32:20.577
Honey, should I change my shirt?

01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:24.788
That'd be nice.

01:32:33.469 --> 01:32:36.142
This is so much fun.

01:32:36.222 --> 01:32:39.182
It's like, you're living in the 20th century.

01:32:46.899 --> 01:32:48.863
This is Mr Parker, Lota.

01:32:48.943 --> 01:32:51.824
How do you do? Don't be afraid.

01:32:51.904 --> 01:32:53.701
How do you do?

01:32:53.781 --> 01:32:56.704
Mr Parker has come to us
from over the sea.

01:32:56.784 --> 01:32:59.081
She's a pure Polynesian.

01:32:59.161 --> 01:33:02.168
The only woman on the entire island.

01:33:02.248 --> 01:33:05.129
Well, uh, I'll leave
you two young people together.

01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:07.089
I've got work to do.

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.720
Won't you sit down?

01:33:14.593 --> 01:33:16.849
You come from the sea?

01:33:16.929 --> 01:33:20.679
Well, around it.
Three days on an upturned lifeboat.

01:33:22.685 --> 01:33:25.935
- You go away?
- Tomorrow morning.

01:33:28.274 --> 01:33:30.614
I wish you would not go away.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.320
Oh, that's very nice of you, but I must.

01:33:39.368 --> 01:33:41.916
You'll come back? Again?

01:33:41.996 --> 01:33:44.496
Well, I don't know.

01:33:47.084 --> 01:33:49.965
How does it happen that you're
the only woman on this island?

01:33:50.045 --> 01:33:52.665
Did, uh, Dr Moreau bring you here?

01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:57.850
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.

01:34:00.055 --> 01:34:01.811
Quickly, please!

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:05.060
Get out!

01:34:10.858 --> 01:34:13.239
They're vivisecting a human being.

01:34:13.319 --> 01:34:16.617
They're cutting a living man to pieces.

01:34:16.697 --> 01:34:18.317
Now I know about his natives.

01:34:19.992 --> 01:34:22.331
They're his victims.

01:34:22.411 --> 01:34:25.126
I did love it that it was in black and white.

01:34:25.206 --> 01:34:27.711
Yeah, yeah, I haven't...

01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:29.921
I haven't seen a black-and-white movie
in a long time.

01:34:32.004 --> 01:34:34.301
My favourite part was when the lead guy

01:34:34.381 --> 01:34:36.220
kissed the wild panther girl.

01:34:37.801 --> 01:34:40.224
You look... you look like her.

01:34:40.304 --> 01:34:41.814
You do. You guys could be twins.

01:34:48.103 --> 01:34:50.234
Well, thank you for treating me
to dinner and a movie.

01:34:50.314 --> 01:34:53.654
I'm happy I could.

01:34:53.734 --> 01:34:56.574
- We should do it every weekend.
- Yeah.

01:34:56.654 --> 01:35:00.077
Now that you're
the cupcake queen of Paterson.

01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:02.407
Cupcake queen of Paterson.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.707
I love it.

01:35:04.787 --> 01:35:05.867
Thank you.

01:35:18.008 --> 01:35:19.758
What is this?

01:35:21.053 --> 01:35:22.553
Marvin?

01:35:25.349 --> 01:35:28.689
Marvin, did you do this?

01:35:40.072 --> 01:35:41.869
Oh, my God!

01:35:41.949 --> 01:35:43.829
It's...

01:35:43.909 --> 01:35:45.289
It's your notebook.

01:35:48.289 --> 01:35:49.619
It's what?

01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:52.921
Your poems.

01:35:56.588 --> 01:35:58.418
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:36:05.139 --> 01:36:08.020
I don't know what to even say.

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:12.940
You... you usually keep your notebook
down at the basement.

01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:20.069
I guess I left it up here on the sofa.

01:36:23.532 --> 01:36:25.412
That stupid dog.

01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:29.581
He's gotta be put out in the garage.

01:37:32.267 --> 01:37:34.898
Honey, it's so early.

01:37:34.978 --> 01:37:36.558
It's Sunday.

01:37:38.315 --> 01:37:40.105
Please, come back to sleep.

01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:45.159
Please, baby.

01:37:45.239 --> 01:37:47.286
I will, I will, baby.

01:37:47.366 --> 01:37:49.326
Ye... Go back to sleep.

01:39:13.368 --> 01:39:15.538
I don't like you, Marvin.

01:39:27.049 --> 01:39:28.804
Marvin, didn't I put you in the garage?

01:39:28.884 --> 01:39:32.057
No, it's okay, I let him
back in when I went outside.

01:39:32.137 --> 01:39:34.560
No, he's going back out there!

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.180
Come on, Marvin!

01:39:37.893 --> 01:39:40.441
No! You're staying out there!

01:39:55.827 --> 01:39:58.997
I wish you would have read me
some of your most recent poems.

01:40:00.582 --> 01:40:03.088
Maybe I could've remembered them.

01:40:03.168 --> 01:40:04.288
It's okay.

01:40:06.129 --> 01:40:07.459
They were just words...

01:40:10.259 --> 01:40:11.549
written on water.

01:40:13.262 --> 01:40:15.262
Baby, I'm so sorry.

01:40:18.225 --> 01:40:20.981
I saved all the pieces.

01:40:21.061 --> 01:40:24.860
Maybe, somehow, they could
be puzzled back together,

01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.404
with a computer programme, or something.

01:40:34.324 --> 01:40:36.414
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:41.835
Should I play you the song
I've been learning on my guitar?

01:40:41.915 --> 01:40:44.546
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:40:44.626 --> 01:40:48.675
Th... I appreciate the offer,
just, maybe, not right now.

01:40:48.755 --> 01:40:49.755
Okay?

01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:56.642
Maybe you just wanna be left alone?

01:40:56.722 --> 01:40:58.227
Should I go out for a while?

01:40:58.307 --> 01:41:00.677
Oh, n-n-no, no. No, it's okay.

01:41:09.276 --> 01:41:12.032
Maybe I'll go out.

01:41:12.112 --> 01:41:13.492
Take a little walk.

01:42:08.794 --> 01:42:11.258
Paterson. It's you.

01:42:11.338 --> 01:42:13.258
Hello, Everett.

01:42:16.343 --> 01:42:20.100
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.060
I kinda lost myself.

01:42:23.433 --> 01:42:24.813
Yeah.

01:42:27.104 --> 01:42:29.064
It's okay. Are you doing better now?

01:42:32.275 --> 01:42:34.565
Yeah, I guess so.

01:42:41.368 --> 01:42:43.624
You okay?

01:42:43.704 --> 01:42:45.626
You look a little low yourself.

01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:47.326
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:52.549
I'm okay.

01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:54.968
Well, it's like they always say.

01:42:55.048 --> 01:42:58.847
"The sun still rises every mornin'
and sets every evenin'."

01:42:58.927 --> 01:43:01.757
- Always another day, right?
- Yeah.

01:43:04.933 --> 01:43:06.938
So far.

01:43:07.018 --> 01:43:08.598
So far, yeah.

01:43:12.566 --> 01:43:17.282
So, I guess I'll see you around, then.

01:43:17.362 --> 01:43:19.362
- Yeah, yeah, take care.
- Yeah, you too.

01:44:24.554 --> 01:44:26.101
Excuse me, please.

01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:28.562
Allow to sit?

01:44:28.642 --> 01:44:30.147
Uh, yeah.

01:44:30.227 --> 01:44:31.767
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:45:15.522 --> 01:45:17.152
Excuse me.

01:45:17.232 --> 01:45:19.738
Maybe not acceptable behaviour,

01:45:19.818 --> 01:45:24.568
but may I ask if you from here,
in Paterson, New Jersey?

01:45:25.615 --> 01:45:26.995
Am I?

01:45:27.075 --> 01:45:29.748
Uh, yeah.

01:45:29.828 --> 01:45:31.368
Yes I am. I was born here.

01:45:32.622 --> 01:45:34.252
Excuse me again.

01:45:34.332 --> 01:45:38.673
But, are you knowing the great
poet, William Carlos Williams?

01:45:38.753 --> 01:45:40.633
Here in Paterson, New Jersey?

01:45:43.633 --> 01:45:47.015
Well, I'm aware of his poems.

01:45:47.095 --> 01:45:49.005
Excellent.

01:45:54.644 --> 01:45:59.984
May I ask if you too are a poet
of Paterson, New Jersey?

01:46:02.068 --> 01:46:05.448
Uh, no.

01:46:06.072 --> 01:46:07.494
No.

01:46:07.574 --> 01:46:08.874
I see.

01:46:15.332 --> 01:46:16.882
I'm a bus driver, myself.

01:46:18.335 --> 01:46:20.257
Just a bus driver.

01:46:20.337 --> 01:46:22.297
A bus driver in Paterson.

01:46:23.256 --> 01:46:24.836
Ah.

01:46:27.552 --> 01:46:29.432
This very poetic.

01:46:29.512 --> 01:46:31.017
Well, I'm not so sure 'bout that.

01:46:31.097 --> 01:46:35.480
Yes. This could be poem
by William Carlos Williams.

01:46:39.522 --> 01:46:43.864
Did you know interesting
French artist Jean Dubuffet

01:46:43.944 --> 01:46:50.245
was meteorologist on top
of Eiffel Tower, Paris, in 1922?

01:46:50.325 --> 01:46:52.873
- Very poetic.
- Yeah.

01:46:52.953 --> 01:46:55.792
Yeah, Jean Dubuffet.

01:46:55.872 --> 01:46:58.292
Yeah, he was, uh, he was a meteorologist.

01:47:00.126 --> 01:47:04.634
This I learn from poem
by your interesting poet,

01:47:04.714 --> 01:47:06.887
Frank O'Hara of New York City.

01:47:06.967 --> 01:47:09.890
Yeah, I read that, too.

01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:11.220
I like Frank O'Hara.

01:47:12.472 --> 01:47:17.230
The... the New York School.

01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:18.520
Ah ha.

01:47:28.113 --> 01:47:30.033
I guess you really like poetry, then?

01:47:31.324 --> 01:47:32.744
I breathe poetry.

01:47:37.455 --> 01:47:39.245
So, you write poetry?

01:47:39.958 --> 01:47:41.078
Yes.

01:47:44.963 --> 01:47:46.968
My notebooks.

01:47:47.048 --> 01:47:48.258
Ah, yeah.

01:47:50.343 --> 01:47:52.103
My poetry only in Japanese.

01:47:52.971 --> 01:47:54.471
No translation.

01:47:56.433 --> 01:47:58.855
Poetry in translation is like

01:47:58.935 --> 01:48:01.608
taking a shower with a raincoat on.

01:48:04.774 --> 01:48:06.284
I see what you mean.

01:48:10.196 --> 01:48:12.702
I hope this isn't, um,
inappropriate behaviour,

01:48:12.782 --> 01:48:16.289
but may I ask what you're doing
here in Paterson?

01:48:16.369 --> 01:48:19.626
I come here to see city
of your interesting poet,

01:48:19.706 --> 01:48:21.419
William Carlos Williams,

01:48:21.499 --> 01:48:25.340
who lived and make his poems
here in Paterson, New Jersey.

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:27.676
- As you know.
- Yeah, yeah. He lived here.

01:48:27.756 --> 01:48:29.260
He was a doctor.

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:31.096
Ah ha.

01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:34.011
"Ah ha," what?

01:48:35.555 --> 01:48:39.725
Also Allen Ginsberg is growing up here.

01:48:40.977 --> 01:48:42.597
Also Paterson, New Jersey.

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:45.480
Yeah, that's true.

01:49:03.708 --> 01:49:05.338
I leave here tomorrow.

01:49:05.418 --> 01:49:06.923
Nice to meet you.

01:49:07.003 --> 01:49:11.761
Oh, nice to meet you. Are you...
you're going back to Tokyo?

01:49:11.841 --> 01:49:13.054
No, Osaka.

01:49:13.134 --> 01:49:16.349
Oh, Osaka. What I meant. Have a good trip.

01:49:16.429 --> 01:49:17.429
Thank you.

01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:20.730
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:35.452
A gift.

01:49:35.532 --> 01:49:37.078
A gift?

01:49:37.158 --> 01:49:39.372
Yes.

01:49:39.452 --> 01:49:43.462
Sometime empty page
present most possibilities.

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.760
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.770
Excuse me!

01:50:06.938 --> 01:50:08.818
Ah ha!

01:50:20.577 --> 01:50:22.537
Ah ha.

01:51:04.662 --> 01:51:06.582
The Line

01:51:08.249 --> 01:51:10.709
There's an old song

01:51:12.045 --> 01:51:16.803
my grandfather used to sing

01:51:16.883 --> 01:51:19.053
that has the question,

01:51:20.762 --> 01:51:25.562
"Or would you rather be a fish?"

01:51:25.642 --> 01:51:28.898
In the same song

01:51:28.978 --> 01:51:31.484
is the same question

01:51:31.564 --> 01:51:35.694
but with a mule and a pig,

01:51:37.904 --> 01:51:42.287
but the one I hear sometimes

01:51:42.367 --> 01:51:44.789
in my head

01:51:44.869 --> 01:51:48.585
is the fish one.

01:51:48.665 --> 01:51:52.165
Just that one line.

01:51:54.462 --> 01:51:57.342
Would you rather be a fish?

01:51:58.967 --> 01:52:04.057
As if the rest of the song

01:52:05.306 --> 01:52:08.226
didn't have to be there.
