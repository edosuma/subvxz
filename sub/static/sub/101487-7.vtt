Peter, I just hit a pothole
in the road and got a flat.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.855
The man who helped us
gave her his card.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.115
I'd keep an eye on that.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.950
This town is falling apart.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.046
Last week the bridge over
the collapsed bridge collapsed.

00:47.239 --> 00:48.789
Well, you're a middle-aged woman
with no job.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.957
Maybe you should get
really worked up about it.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.201
You know what? I think I will.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.220
I'm going down
to city hall to complain.

00:55.413 --> 00:57.389
This town needs a mayor.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.686
Y-You forgot your baby. Miss?

01:07.684 --> 01:10.127
Thank you all for coming over
to help us find

01:10.145 --> 01:11.904
the best candidate for mayor.

01:12.097 --> 01:14.389
This room is so diverse,
so I'm assuming

01:14.408 --> 01:16.724
many of you have agendas.

01:16.786 --> 01:20.304
But let's keep in mind we need
a mayor who will represent

01:20.364 --> 01:23.082
all of Quahog
and not just satisfy

01:23.275 --> 01:25.084
your weird
little fringe issues,

01:25.277 --> 01:27.586
which are important,
but not very important.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.755
As a descendent
of Quahog's Puritan forefathers,

01:29.924 --> 01:32.149
I think we should be able
to throw a woman into a pond

01:32.167 --> 01:33.575
to see if she's a witch.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.928
That seems a bit extreme,
don't you think?

01:36.121 --> 01:39.747
That's exactly
what a witch would say.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.491
Lois, you're making this harder
than it needs to be.

01:41.552 --> 01:43.602
Just get a former Batman
and move on.

01:43.753 --> 01:45.587
I'm sure Val Kilmer
could use the insurance.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.014
Peter, we're not going
to get a former Batman.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.442
That has been pitched
every day since Adam West died

01:50.611 --> 01:52.853
and the response
has been tepid at best.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.096
We need someone
with fresh ideas.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.615
Someone who knows the issues.

01:56.808 --> 02:00.119
Well, if you're looking
for someone with issues,

02:00.312 --> 02:02.529
I think you've found
your candidate.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.939
(laughs)

02:04.959 --> 02:06.533
(Stewie laughs)

02:06.627 --> 02:08.794
I had to go to bed early
because it's a grown-up party,

02:08.987 --> 02:10.354
but Mom said if I was quiet,

02:10.414 --> 02:12.539
I could listen
from the top of the stairs.

02:12.691 --> 02:15.208
You know, I think you might be
a really good candidate.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.285
You know the town, you're smart

02:17.346 --> 02:19.621
and you clearly have
nothing better to do.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.808
So all in favor of the librarian
running for mayor say aye.

02:23.001 --> 02:24.885
-ALL: Aye.
-What about ALF?

02:24.979 --> 02:27.053
Let's toast our new mayor...

02:27.189 --> 02:29.648
um, I'm sorry,
I don't even know your name.

02:29.841 --> 02:31.817
Elle. Elle Hitler.

02:31.968 --> 02:33.652
(laughs)
No relation.

02:33.845 --> 02:35.687
Elle Hitler? Eh.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.823
Let's all say hi to Elle Hitler.

02:38.016 --> 02:41.535
-Hi, Elle Hitler.
Yay!

02:44.814 --> 02:47.166
I can't believe Lois wants
the librarian to be mayor.

02:47.359 --> 02:48.650
I mean, Mayor West was a legend,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.243
and now they're gonna
replace him

02:50.337 --> 02:52.078
with some third-tier character
with a joke name?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.822
-That's Chinatown, Peter.
-What?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.825
I said, "That's Chinatown."
It's from the movie<i> Chinatown.</i>

02:57.887 --> 03:01.405
It means, like, "What are you
gonna do? That's Chinatown."

03:01.423 --> 03:02.664
Joe, did you finally
get Netflix?

03:02.725 --> 03:05.075
I did.
And I just watched<i> Chinatown.</i>

03:05.093 --> 03:06.668
It's kind of gross.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.504
Quahog deserves a cool mayor,
like Mayor West was.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.264
But there's no one cooler
than Adam West.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.859
If only he had had a offspring.

03:14.010 --> 03:17.421
Speaking of offspring,
Faye Dunaway slept with her dad

03:17.439 --> 03:20.424
in<i> Chinatown</i>
and then had his baby.

03:20.525 --> 03:22.850
Guys, that movie
really messed me up.

03:22.912 --> 03:26.263
Wait a second,
Mayor West didn't have any kids,

03:26.323 --> 03:30.434
but he did have a cousin,
Wild West.

03:30.494 --> 03:32.118
You guys don't know Wild West?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.695

11:14.031 --> 11:15.415
(babbles excitedly)

11:15.509 --> 11:17.567
-(chirping)
-(laughs)

11:17.627 --> 11:21.179
Peter said something about me
really sticks in your craw.

11:21.372 --> 11:24.331
(chuckles)
Let's not make this sexy, okay?

11:24.393 --> 11:26.926
I just don't think it's fair
for you to breeze into town

11:27.020 --> 11:30.021
with your rugged good looks
and voice of the gods

11:30.190 --> 11:31.856
and assume you should be mayor.

11:32.008 --> 11:34.175
Especially when you're
taking an opportunity away

11:34.236 --> 11:36.102
from a very deserving woman.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.862
That's a fair point, Lois.

11:38.055 --> 11:41.182
Do you mind if I make you
a sweater while I respond?

11:41.243 --> 11:43.851
(exhales)
Uh, no.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.595
No, that would be fine.

11:45.613 --> 11:49.432
Lois, I moved my whole family
to Oregon when I was 13,

11:49.492 --> 11:52.118
and it taught me that
a town is like a horse.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.770
You don't choose it.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.288
-(bleats)
-It chooses you.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.607
And I believe Quahog
has chosen me,

11:57.667 --> 11:59.592
just like it chose
my cousin Adam.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.537
Now, the last thing I want to do
is take something from a woman.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.224
There's nothing
I respect more than women.

12:06.417 --> 12:08.709
(giggles)
Is that so?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.544
Yes'm.
I've raised 16 daughters

12:10.605 --> 12:13.231
into strong, independent women,

12:13.424 --> 12:15.458
I'm a registered doula,

12:15.518 --> 12:18.978
and I always order edamame
for the table.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.389
(sighing):
Oh, my God. Oh. Huh.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.984
So, y-you're all alone...
up here?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.727
With no one to...

12:26.788 --> 12:29.322
touch your sweaty biceps?

12:29.458 --> 12:30.397
Huh?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.475
A man's never alone, Lois,

12:32.535 --> 12:34.919
so long as he has
his principles.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.815
(shuddering):
H-H-Holy thundering Lord.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.985
Lois, can we keep it?
I'll take care of it, I promise.

12:42.086 --> 12:43.486
-(chomps)
-Aah!

12:43.588 --> 12:44.912
Ow! He bit me!

12:44.931 --> 12:46.489
I don't like it now.

12:46.591 --> 12:47.557
(squealing)

12:51.772 --> 12:55.607
Peter, do you wanna maybe
do some role-playing?

12:55.800 --> 12:58.001
Okay.
I'll be Quentin Tarantino,

12:58.019 --> 12:59.944
and you be the foot
I make a mess on.

13:00.137 --> 13:01.929
No, actually, I-I was thinking

13:01.948 --> 13:04.690
that maybe you could pretend
to be a cowboy.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.433
Okay.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.935
(sighs):
Oh, Lois...

13:07.996 --> 13:09.529
LOIS:
Uh, make your voice deeper.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.456
-PETER (deeper): Oh, Lois...
-Deeper!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.625
PETER (very deep):
Oh, Lois.

13:13.776 --> 13:14.942
LOIS:
Good.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.521
Now say, "Beef:
it's what's for dinner."

13:18.540 --> 13:20.281
-PETER: I-I don't...
-Say it!
-(loud slap)

13:20.342 --> 13:21.858
-PETER (very deep): Beef...
-Oh, yes.

13:21.876 --> 13:23.951
-it's what's for dinner.
-(laughs): Oh, yes!

13:24.054 --> 13:26.287
Oh, Wild West, Wild West.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.472
PETER:
What?!

13:27.665 --> 13:29.382
Peter, what the hell
are you wearing?

13:29.476 --> 13:32.051
I went a different direction,
cowboy-wise,

13:32.187 --> 13:33.978
but don't change the subject!

13:39.010 --> 13:39.984
(paint can rattles)

13:41.679 --> 13:44.471
-Peter, what are you doing?
-I've decided that Wild West

13:44.491 --> 13:46.549
is the worst possible person
to be mayor,

13:46.609 --> 13:48.976
and I'm gonna do
whatever I can to stop him.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.721
O-Okay, is this because I called
out his name twice during sex

13:51.739 --> 13:53.814
and once
while I was peeing after?

13:53.875 --> 13:57.393
-That's part of it, yes.
-I'm sorry, Peter,
it just slipped out.

13:57.453 --> 14:00.154
Well, I'm sorry I'm the length
of a Mike and Ike!

14:00.215 --> 14:02.298
In your dreams.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.901
(takes deep breath)

14:04.961 --> 14:06.586
That one stung, Lois.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.679
(takes deep breath)

14:07.872 --> 14:10.181
Ooh, that one stung.

14:13.044 --> 14:14.335
All right, I'm on your side now.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.020
And if you're gonna
beat Wild West,

14:16.213 --> 14:18.264
you have to recognize that
one of his greatest strengths

14:18.358 --> 14:21.751
is his voice, which makes him
sound sexy and smart

14:21.811 --> 14:23.419
and sexy and sexy.

14:23.479 --> 14:25.755
Where your voice sounds
like your dad's second wife

14:25.815 --> 14:28.774
trying to describe
something she saw on Facebook.

14:28.927 --> 14:29.850
Oh, speaking of,

14:29.953 --> 14:33.112
do you know what a meme is?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.855
What...
Course I do.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.282
And it's pronounced "me-me."

14:36.434 --> 14:39.118
Well, the other day, I saw one

14:39.212 --> 14:41.104
with the most adorable kitten

14:41.122 --> 14:43.122
tangled in a ball of yarn.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.550
(laughing)

14:45.743 --> 14:47.610
And underneath...

14:47.670 --> 14:50.704
underneath, it said:
"(bleep) the police."

14:50.724 --> 14:52.223
(laughing)

14:52.416 --> 14:54.450
Okay, that was unexpected,
so I'm gonna ignore it

14:54.510 --> 14:56.452
and bring in Morgan Freeman,
who I've hired

14:56.512 --> 14:58.121
to narrate your commercials.

14:58.222 --> 15:00.456
We're gonna fight voice
with voice.

15:00.516 --> 15:03.217
Wild West claims to know
what's best for Quahog,

15:03.320 --> 15:05.128
but there's a better choice.

15:05.188 --> 15:06.796
And I know about choice.

15:06.856 --> 15:08.889
I chose to be in<i> Ted 2.</i>

15:08.992 --> 15:10.149
Nobody made me.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.151
I wasn't forced at gunpoint.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.562
I relied on my advisors,
and they let me down.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.582
"They'll fix the script,"
they said.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.158
Well, they were wrong.

15:19.310 --> 15:21.327
I thought I'd get to act
with a talking teddy bear,

15:21.421 --> 15:22.754
but when I got there,

15:22.947 --> 15:26.149
it was just two ping-pong balls
on a stick.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.651
Or maybe that was
Amanda Seyfried.

15:28.711 --> 15:30.336
I don't know.

15:30.488 --> 15:33.322
Okay, thank-thank you.
Thank you, Morgan. Thank you.

15:33.424 --> 15:35.600
Peter, just let me speak
to the voters

15:35.793 --> 15:38.436
about the issues
they're concerned about.

15:38.587 --> 15:40.421
Or, instead of doing
that stupid thing,

15:40.482 --> 15:42.923
we could sabotage
Wild West's campaign.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.651
Come on, you can drive.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.674
Big Garfield fan, huh?

15:51.676 --> 15:52.951
Me, too.

15:53.144 --> 15:54.768
-Not this big.
-You know, a lot of people

15:54.788 --> 15:58.772
think I'm obsessed,
but I think I'm pretty<i> nermal.</i>

15:58.792 --> 16:00.291
(laughing)

16:00.460 --> 16:03.127
Okay, you reeled me back in.

16:18.853 --> 16:23.106
(quietly):
Let's see how popular you are
when I cut off your mustache.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.743
(grunts)

16:43.895 --> 16:46.562
How is this so strong?

16:46.622 --> 16:50.991
My hair follicles run deeper
than the roots of a sequoia.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.902
Git him, fella.

16:52.962 --> 16:54.512
Oh! Aah!

16:54.705 --> 16:55.596
(grunts)

16:57.392 --> 16:58.908
Aah!

16:58.968 --> 17:00.184
Nice work.

Don't panic, The Librarian.

Quahog's new mayor is Wild West.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.104
(cheering)

With a final vote of 43 to 19,

it's clear that
no one really cared.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.351
Nice job, guys.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.445
Peter, can I talk to you?

18:34.597 --> 18:37.615
-What?
-Look, I know we've had
our differences,

18:37.808 --> 18:41.043
but I'm hoping that someday
we can bury the hatchet,

18:41.045 --> 18:42.603
maybe even be friends.
