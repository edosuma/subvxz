Hey, that wasn't good.

00:41.635 --> 00:43.436
Come on. We should
get out of here.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.661
I think we
came this way.

00:57.134 --> 00:59.402
Look-- a tent.

01:03.874 --> 01:05.408
Hello? Anybody there?

01:05.476 --> 01:07.460
No, we can't go
in there.

01:07.527 --> 01:09.962
You kidding? We got to
get out of this rain.

Outstanding group.

02:10.607 --> 02:11.724
Thank you, sir.

02:13.277 --> 02:16.112
Good to know your father's
rifle still shoots tight.

02:16.196 --> 02:17.763
Yeah. He taught me how
to break it down

02:17.815 --> 02:19.265
before I was allowed
to fire a round.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.318
He told me about
this place.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.238
Your father wanted
to bring you here.

02:27.324 --> 02:30.576
He promised me a hunting rifle
for my 16th birthday.

02:30.627 --> 02:32.111
Then things changed.

02:33.130 --> 02:34.380
Hey.

02:34.448 --> 02:36.749
You don't you put a couple
of rounds through it?

02:39.887 --> 02:42.955
Let me see if I can put some
lead through that target.

02:43.006 --> 02:44.507
Well, boy, that's 700 yards--

02:44.591 --> 02:46.726
a hell of a long shot
for an old man like you.

02:46.793 --> 02:48.060
I got 20 bucks

02:48.128 --> 02:49.345
says you don't
even hit steel.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.646
How do you like that?

02:50.731 --> 02:53.566
Well, let's make
it two rounds.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.718
- Double or nothing.
- You got it.

03:04.027 --> 03:05.361
Ready.

03:06.747 --> 03:08.147
I have the target.

03:20.327 --> 03:22.178
Nice shooting, Joe.

03:22.262 --> 03:23.629
Must be the rifle.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.164
Must be.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.968
I'll tell you what--
you buy me one of those

03:29.019 --> 03:30.186
umbrella drinks,
we'll call it even.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.187
Okay.

03:31.271 --> 03:32.522
So, uh...

03:32.589 --> 03:34.557
when you are you going back
to Coronado?

03:34.641 --> 03:36.442
I'm not.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.945
I put in for a transfer
to Pearl Harbor.

03:39.012 --> 03:41.280
- Overseeing SEAL team training.
- Really?

03:42.649 --> 03:44.484
The island seemed like a...

03:44.535 --> 03:46.068
pretty good place
to wind it down.

03:46.153 --> 03:48.621
The thing is, Joe,
I mean, you're not the...

03:48.688 --> 03:50.206
you're not really
a fun-in-the-sun,

03:50.290 --> 03:51.457
hang-loose, aloha type.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.960
They let you stay.

03:54.027 --> 03:55.578
Yeah, they did.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.671
What's Hawaiian
for "bottoms up"?

04:05.722 --> 04:07.173
<i>Okole maluna.</i>

04:07.224 --> 04:08.891
Here's to hanging loose.

04:08.976 --> 04:10.376
I'll believe that
when I see it.

04:15.098 --> 04:16.516
Hey, you know what?

04:16.567 --> 04:19.435
It's going to be good
to have you around.

04:25.325 --> 04:27.660
Joe White.

04:27.727 --> 04:29.895
When?

04:32.165 --> 04:34.000
I'm on my way.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.401
Everything all right?

04:36.420 --> 04:37.570
No.

04:45.345 --> 04:47.597
The deceased's name
is Clay Garcia.

04:47.681 --> 04:49.098
That's his
wife, Marissa.

04:49.182 --> 04:50.466
Cause of death?

04:50.551 --> 04:52.351
Technically speaking,
it's not my case.

04:52.419 --> 04:54.136
That's not an answer, Max.

04:54.221 --> 04:55.388
The body was recovered
in the jungle.

04:55.439 --> 04:57.273
The cause of death
was a self-inflicted

04:57.357 --> 04:59.392
gunshot wound with a gun
registered to him.

05:08.268 --> 05:10.369
<i>One of the reasons</i>
<i>I came back to this island</i>

05:10.437 --> 05:12.872
was to be around guys
like Garcia.

05:14.191 --> 05:15.491
You trained him,
didn't you?

05:15.559 --> 05:17.994
One of the best SEALs
I'd ever seen.

05:18.061 --> 05:20.580
We were supposed to go
spearfishing next week.

05:22.616 --> 05:24.417
Why would he
kill himself?

05:24.468 --> 05:27.136
Deployments took a toll
on his marriage.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.138
He went on leave
from active duty

05:29.206 --> 05:31.307
hoping to reconcile.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.476
Hell, he was going to fight
to save his marriage,

05:33.543 --> 05:35.011
not shoot himself
up in the jungle.

05:35.078 --> 05:36.395
Joe, I've seen guys
kill themselves

05:36.463 --> 05:37.847
'cause they can't make
a mortgage payment.

05:37.931 --> 05:39.632
Yeah, but Garcia
was not that guy.

05:39.683 --> 05:40.983
He was squared away.

05:41.068 --> 05:43.069
No matter how hard

05:43.136 --> 05:46.105
or impossible the assignment,
Garcia took it.

05:46.156 --> 05:48.774
Something's not right.

05:50.077 --> 05:51.611
He didn't kill himself.

05:52.646 --> 05:54.480
You want me to
look into this?

05:56.416 --> 05:58.451
You tell me it's a suicide,
I'll believe it.

05:59.486 --> 06:01.120
All right.

06:03.507 --> 06:05.207
Max, did you take a look?

06:05.292 --> 06:07.460
Oh, I shouldn't
even be doing this.

06:07.511 --> 06:11.414
Well, I familiarized myself
with the M.E.'s case summary

06:11.481 --> 06:13.916
and took a cursory look
at the crime scene photos.

06:13.984 --> 06:15.968
Okay, I need you to take
a closer look, Max, okay?

06:16.019 --> 06:17.853
You want me to reopen the case?

06:17.938 --> 06:18.904
Yeah. What's the big deal?

06:18.972 --> 06:21.173
Do you have any
extenuating evidence

06:21.224 --> 06:23.309
that might suggest
that this wasn't a suicide?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.477
No.

06:24.528 --> 06:26.612
Okay, well, then,
I'm going to need

06:26.680 --> 06:28.648
a little bit more than that

06:28.699 --> 06:30.566
in order to officially
reopen the case,

06:30.651 --> 06:32.702
considering that my boss,
the senior medical examiner,

06:32.786 --> 06:35.071
was the one who performed
the autopsy.

06:35.138 --> 06:36.822
There is an unwritten rule

06:36.873 --> 06:38.991
that you don't mess
with the boss's toe tags.

06:39.042 --> 06:40.326
Well, maybe he made
a mistake, Max.

06:40.377 --> 06:41.711
Highly unlikely.

06:41.795 --> 06:44.330
He graduated summa cum laude
from Harvard Medical School.

06:44.398 --> 06:46.499
Besides,
the weapon found

06:46.550 --> 06:48.867
in the deceased's hand
was registered to him.

06:48.919 --> 06:51.387
So, unless there
is new evidence or a...

06:51.471 --> 06:53.639
a compelling theory
of a crime being committed...

06:53.707 --> 06:55.007
Max, Max,

06:55.058 --> 06:56.325
listen to me.

06:56.393 --> 06:59.061
My former C.O. lost
one of his men.

06:59.146 --> 07:00.930
I want you to reopen this case.

07:01.982 --> 07:03.349
Is this a favor or an order?

07:03.400 --> 07:04.684
It's both.

07:33.346 --> 07:35.898
So, what, are you hanging
with Ray Mapes now?

07:35.966 --> 07:37.800
Well, hello
to you, too, cuz.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.301
You do know that HPD

07:39.386 --> 07:41.103
forced him out of the
department, right?

07:41.188 --> 07:42.555
Yeah, well,
that makes three of us.

07:42.606 --> 07:44.473
The only difference is
you got your badge back

07:44.558 --> 07:46.358
and I'm never going to.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.444
There's a big difference.
Mapes was a gardener--

07:48.528 --> 07:51.013
planting evidence,
collecting ethics violations.

07:51.081 --> 07:52.732
I wonder what they
say about me.

07:52.783 --> 07:55.484
You can't let I.A.
tell the story.

07:55.569 --> 07:56.902
That's exactly
what Fryer wants.

07:56.953 --> 07:59.288
What does it matter?
They've already won.

07:59.372 --> 08:01.373
I have to move on
with my life.

08:01.441 --> 08:02.792
Move on where?

08:02.876 --> 08:04.126
You're a cop.

08:04.211 --> 08:05.544
Yeah.

08:05.612 --> 08:06.912
Without a badge.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.666
You remember when you
shredded your knee?

08:10.751 --> 08:13.052
Doctors said you'd never
get up on a board again,

08:13.119 --> 08:14.303
and you proved
them wrong.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.238
- It's not the same.
- It is.

08:16.306 --> 08:19.008
Except, on this one, you're
giving up without a fight.

08:19.092 --> 08:23.012
Look, I appreciate everything
you're trying to do,

08:23.096 --> 08:25.097
but you're wasting your time.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.360
<i>Lori Weston.</i>

08:38.445 --> 08:41.730
This is Joe White,
my old Navy SEAL commander.

08:41.798 --> 08:42.998
Hi.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.767
Agent Weston has recently
joined the task force.

08:44.835 --> 08:46.669
Well, that's a step up
from describing

08:46.753 --> 08:48.254
my role here as babysitting.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.371
They were actually
your words.

08:49.456 --> 08:51.173
Yeah, but you were thinking it.

08:51.241 --> 08:52.508
Okay, now she's
a mind reader

08:52.592 --> 08:53.592
as well as a profiler.

08:53.660 --> 08:54.627
"A welcome addition
to the team"

08:54.678 --> 08:56.846
is, I believe,
how he put it.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.430
I said, given her bonafides,
she would be welcome...

08:58.498 --> 09:00.349
Uh, you two work out
this little act

09:00.433 --> 09:01.350
beforehand?

09:01.434 --> 09:02.384
It's nice to meet you.

09:02.469 --> 09:03.686
Nice to meet you.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.521
Sorry to hear
about your friend.

09:05.605 --> 09:07.890
Mmm. Steve is
looking into it.

09:07.974 --> 09:09.892
On the Q.T., of course.

09:09.976 --> 09:10.993
Speaking of which...

09:11.061 --> 09:12.394
Hey, uh... creepy.

09:12.479 --> 09:14.396
Why you dressed
like Inspector Gadget?

09:14.481 --> 09:16.565
Reopening a closed case
without authorization

09:16.650 --> 09:18.033
is considered risky.

09:18.118 --> 09:19.568
So I took
precautions.

09:19.653 --> 09:22.655
Uh, all right.
What do you got?

09:28.578 --> 09:32.047
After carefully studying
the blood spatter patterns,

09:32.132 --> 09:33.833
I noticed there
were subtle deviations

09:33.900 --> 09:35.334
that I couldn't account for.

09:35.402 --> 09:38.637
So I ran GSR tests
on the victim's clothing,

09:38.705 --> 09:40.890
as well as the
tent wall samples,

09:40.974 --> 09:42.808
factoring in velocity
relative to the hand position,

09:42.876 --> 09:45.778
which is, of course,
after I recalculated

09:45.846 --> 09:48.264
the bullet trajectory based
on skull fracture analysis...

09:48.348 --> 09:49.523
Wait. Time-out.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.348
Max, just give us
the CliffsNotes version.

09:51.484 --> 09:53.669
Okay?

09:53.737 --> 09:55.170
Okay.

09:56.206 --> 09:57.890
You were right.

09:57.941 --> 09:59.692
This is a homicide.

10:02.495 --> 10:04.747
The GSR gaps in
the victim's hand,

10:04.831 --> 10:07.383
combined with the inconsistent
blood spatter,

10:07.450 --> 10:08.868
leads me to believe

10:08.935 --> 10:10.586
that the killer placed the gun

10:10.670 --> 10:14.123
in the victim's hand
and then pulled the trigger.

10:14.207 --> 10:15.541
This was a highly trained
Navy SEAL.

10:15.592 --> 10:17.209
No one's just going to walk up
and put a gun

10:17.260 --> 10:18.711
in his hand and pull the trigger
without a fight.

10:18.762 --> 10:21.463
Right. Maybe he was
incapacitated first.

10:21.548 --> 10:23.048
Yes. Max,

10:23.099 --> 10:24.850
run a full tox screen, okay?

10:24.918 --> 10:26.952
After I officially...

10:27.020 --> 10:29.221
reopen the case.

10:34.911 --> 10:36.278
Somebody went to a lot
of trouble

10:36.363 --> 10:37.813
to make this look
like a suicide.

10:49.228 --> 10:50.995
Right up through there.

10:56.068 --> 10:57.869
How'd you know
where this was?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.522
He trained Garcia.

11:00.589 --> 11:03.258
SEALs are taught to minimize
risk in the field,

11:03.342 --> 11:05.276
and this is one of the few
defensible campsites

11:05.344 --> 11:07.011
with a view of the trail.

11:07.079 --> 11:08.713
Would have
been hardwired into him.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.684
What was Garcia
doing up here, Joe?

11:14.086 --> 11:15.053
When I got divorced,

11:15.104 --> 11:16.771
I packed up
the pickup truck

11:16.856 --> 11:18.289
and headed for
the mountains.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.724
Which divorce?

11:19.775 --> 11:21.943
Number three.

11:22.011 --> 11:23.812
I was a mess.

11:23.896 --> 11:26.481
I spent a week backpacking
in the Beartooths.

11:26.565 --> 11:29.367
Okay, so Garcia
comes up here

11:29.435 --> 11:31.119
to wrap his head
around the end of his marriage?

11:31.203 --> 11:34.406
Sometimes you got
to get off the grid,

11:34.457 --> 11:36.040
you know,
regroup,

11:36.108 --> 11:37.608
put things in perspective.

11:39.278 --> 11:41.162
His killer went
to a lot of trouble.

11:41.247 --> 11:43.381
Think about it-- Garcia--
he's up here isolated,

11:43.449 --> 11:44.666
probably not
in the best mental shape.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.502
Got something!

11:47.586 --> 11:47.635
He must have built a fire
away from the tent site.

11:52.308 --> 11:54.259
Look at that.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.010
What do you got?

11:56.095 --> 11:59.264
Some kind of sediment in there.

11:59.315 --> 12:00.899
Okay, have Fong
run it and, uh,

12:00.966 --> 12:02.951
check the bottle for prints.

12:07.973 --> 12:09.741
What is it?

12:09.808 --> 12:12.744
Chin, let me see
those crime scene photos.

12:17.116 --> 12:21.035
Garcia's pants and boots
were caked with red dirt.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.004
Doesn't match the stuff here
at his campsite.

12:23.088 --> 12:24.088
Probably took a hike.

12:24.156 --> 12:25.607
Yeah, well,
he wouldn't hit red dirt

12:25.674 --> 12:27.375
until he got to the other side
of that ridge over there.

12:27.460 --> 12:30.011
My uncle used to take me
up there looking for wild guava.

12:30.095 --> 12:31.829
Lead the way.

12:37.002 --> 12:38.987
<i>So how long were you</i>
<i>and Clay separated?</i>

12:41.090 --> 12:43.291
We weren't officially separated.

12:43.359 --> 12:45.093
But you asked him to leave?

12:47.029 --> 12:49.814
I... I thought
some time

12:49.882 --> 12:51.733
apart would help.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.134
Did you two have a fight?

12:55.955 --> 12:57.872
Yes.

12:57.957 --> 12:59.824
Okay, can you tell us
what it was about?

13:04.129 --> 13:06.381
It's not easy being
married to a SEAL.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.917
He was
always away

13:08.984 --> 13:10.385
on some deployment,

13:10.469 --> 13:14.589
and I never knew when
he was going to come back or...

13:14.673 --> 13:16.474
or if,

13:16.542 --> 13:17.892
and I couldn't

13:17.977 --> 13:19.594
just sit around here and wait.

13:19.678 --> 13:21.963
So you took a job
to keep busy?

13:22.031 --> 13:24.766
Yes, waiting tables.

13:24.850 --> 13:28.052
Okay, um, but he did take
a leave from the navy

13:28.103 --> 13:30.104
to come back here and work
on the marriage, right?

13:30.189 --> 13:31.105
I never asked him

13:31.190 --> 13:33.724
to do that.

13:33.776 --> 13:35.660
Being a SEAL was
the one thing he loved.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.229
More than you?

13:42.885 --> 13:47.038
I'm sorry, I-I didn't...
I didn't even offer you coffee.

13:47.089 --> 13:49.824
I'm fine,
thank you.

13:55.247 --> 13:57.915
Marissa, can I ask you,
was there someone else?

13:59.935 --> 14:02.470
Clay was convinced
that I was having an affair

14:02.555 --> 14:04.105
with my boss at the grill.

14:04.189 --> 14:06.140
Were you?

14:06.225 --> 14:07.525
No.

14:07.593 --> 14:09.310
But he wanted
to believe

14:09.395 --> 14:12.413
there was a reason
why our marriage wasn't working.

14:13.415 --> 14:15.033
And the truth was

14:15.100 --> 14:17.819
I had fallen
out of love with him.

14:17.903 --> 14:20.872
Did, did you tell him that?

14:22.374 --> 14:24.959
He took it pretty hard.

14:25.044 --> 14:26.628
Hmm.

14:26.712 --> 14:28.079
We're going to need
your boss's name.

14:28.130 --> 14:32.133
It's, uh, Nick Drayton.

14:34.787 --> 14:36.437
Thank you.

14:39.258 --> 14:41.175
<i>So what do you think?</i>

14:41.260 --> 14:43.761
I think she's telling the truth.

14:43.812 --> 14:45.513
About the affair
or why her marriage imploded?

14:45.598 --> 14:48.182
She was being evasive
about something.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.902
I'd like to talk to this boss
of hers, check his alibi.

14:54.657 --> 14:56.524
So how long were you married?

14:56.609 --> 15:00.111
That clearly has nothing
to do with this case.

15:00.162 --> 15:01.529
Oh, no, your-your
body language says it does.

15:01.597 --> 15:02.580
My, my body language?

15:02.648 --> 15:04.499
My body language
is "I'm driving."

15:04.583 --> 15:06.117
- See?
- Yeah, no,

15:06.168 --> 15:07.335
you were, you were rubbing
your ring finger.

15:07.419 --> 15:08.620
Every guy does it.

15:08.671 --> 15:10.872
Just means you're thinking
about your own marriage.

15:10.939 --> 15:13.207
Oh, okay.

15:13.292 --> 15:14.509
I just point out
the obvious.

15:14.576 --> 15:16.210
Most men can't handle the
truth when it comes to love.

15:16.295 --> 15:17.962
We can't handle the
truth when it come...?

15:18.013 --> 15:18.963
What are we doing,

15:19.014 --> 15:20.264
<i>A Few Good Men?</i>

15:20.332 --> 15:21.466
What truth can't...
what can't we handle?

15:21.517 --> 15:22.684
That marriages fail.

15:22.768 --> 15:23.685
Well, what
about you?

15:23.769 --> 15:24.802
You ever
been married?

15:24.853 --> 15:27.138
No, no, I came close once.

15:27.189 --> 15:28.856
You came close once?

15:28.941 --> 15:30.108
Close is no good unless
you're playing horseshoes

15:30.175 --> 15:31.109
or hand grenades.

15:31.176 --> 15:32.310
Okay, what do
you mean, clo...?

15:32.361 --> 15:33.895
You either were married
or you were not married.

15:33.979 --> 15:35.563
No, close,
like day-before-the-wedding-

15:35.648 --> 15:36.564
bought-the-dress close.

15:36.649 --> 15:39.150
Wow, <i>Runaway Bride.</i>

15:39.201 --> 15:40.685
What, what happened?

15:40.736 --> 15:41.686
You first.

15:41.737 --> 15:43.705
No, it's very complicated.

15:43.789 --> 15:45.456
Yeah? Ditto.

15:45.524 --> 15:46.691
Hmm.

15:46.742 --> 15:48.242
Listen, I still think
we should go see

15:48.327 --> 15:50.878
this guy Garcia's wife
wasn't having an affair with.

15:59.171 --> 16:01.255
It's up here.

16:02.474 --> 16:04.225
Chin, Chin, Chin, freeze!

16:04.309 --> 16:05.376
What?

16:05.444 --> 16:06.427
Trip wire.

16:07.529 --> 16:09.480
Don't move.

16:09.548 --> 16:11.516
Listen to me.

16:11.567 --> 16:12.934
Just keep
the pressure even, okay?

16:13.018 --> 16:14.235
Don't shift your weight.

16:14.319 --> 16:15.436
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.390
Just don't move.

16:23.028 --> 16:24.445
What is that?

16:24.530 --> 16:25.830
It's a shotgun shell.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.711
All right, Joe.

16:45.417 --> 16:46.467
You got it?

16:46.552 --> 16:48.085
Yeah, cut it.

16:52.424 --> 16:54.225
Clear.

16:56.061 --> 16:58.062
Crude but effective.

16:58.113 --> 16:59.814
Thanks.

17:00.866 --> 17:04.152
Hawaii's not exactly
the place for...

17:04.219 --> 17:05.435
IEDs.

17:07.873 --> 17:10.191
It is if you want to keep
your investment safe.

17:11.376 --> 17:13.377
Hidden dope grow.

17:20.469 --> 17:24.005
Gentlemen, who wants to retire?

17:24.089 --> 17:27.258
Looks like a couple
million dollars worth.

17:27.309 --> 17:29.177
Okay, so Garcia goes hiking,

17:29.261 --> 17:30.812
he stumbles upon the growers.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.930
How'd he miss stepping
on one of those shells?

17:32.981 --> 17:34.465
He was trained
to spot stuff like that.

17:34.516 --> 17:37.485
Yeah, but he could have
tripped one of these.

17:37.569 --> 17:40.021
That's a motion sensor camera.

17:40.105 --> 17:42.206
It's a pretty high-tech
operation.

17:42.274 --> 17:44.442
Growers monitor the site
from some nearby location.

17:44.493 --> 17:46.861
You think they're watching?

17:46.945 --> 17:49.747
Let's hope so.

17:57.656 --> 17:59.957
Hey, man, you better take
a look at this.

18:02.478 --> 18:04.245
What the hell?

18:04.313 --> 18:06.430
Come on.

18:19.027 --> 18:20.678
There he is.

18:38.964 --> 18:40.631
Don't do it, don't do it.

18:44.369 --> 18:45.970
Car trouble?

18:50.146 --> 18:51.597
<i>So the DEA is paying</i>

18:51.598 --> 18:55.167
a visit to your little
organic farm right about now.

18:55.251 --> 18:57.252
Roots and all, by the time
they get done weighing

18:57.320 --> 18:58.754
all those plants,

18:58.821 --> 19:00.789
you're looking
at a good, long stretch.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.592
This the part where I cooperate?

19:03.659 --> 19:05.544
'Cause it ain't gonna happen.

19:05.628 --> 19:08.213
I got a lawyer for playing nice
with you police.

19:08.298 --> 19:11.100
No, this is the part
where you tell us about him,

19:11.167 --> 19:12.351
and maybe

19:12.435 --> 19:14.970
we take a little of that
weight off the table.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.221
That's Clay Garcia.

19:16.306 --> 19:18.107
He was found shot dead
up near your dope grow.

19:18.174 --> 19:20.025
Look at the photo.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.059
You saw him,
didn't you?

19:21.127 --> 19:23.061
He tripped one
of the cameras.

19:23.146 --> 19:24.446
You pay him
a little visit?

19:24.514 --> 19:25.514
Maybe.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.065
Don't mean I shot him.

19:27.150 --> 19:30.285
No, sure, I mean, you look
more like a pit bulls

19:30.353 --> 19:31.653
and butterfly knife
type of guy to me.

19:32.522 --> 19:33.455
What do you mean?

19:33.523 --> 19:34.623
Somebody shot him
in the head,

19:34.690 --> 19:35.824
made it look like a suicide.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.327
Oh, yeah, that ain't my style,

19:38.378 --> 19:39.795
but you already know that,
don't you?

19:39.862 --> 19:41.497
Yeah, we already know that.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.698
What we don't know is what
happened after you ran into him.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.917
Why don't you tell us
about that?

19:47.670 --> 19:49.605
Dude was ice, man.

19:49.672 --> 19:53.725
Had my boy put a knife to him,
and next thing I know,

19:53.810 --> 19:56.011
he's on the ground
with busted fingers.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.564
What did you do?

19:58.648 --> 20:00.065
Told him to stay
away from our grow

20:00.150 --> 20:02.351
and we got
no problem.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.853
We left it cool.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.388
Anybody else
up there with him?

20:06.439 --> 20:07.439
Not with him.

20:07.524 --> 20:09.441
We had another trip
on the cameras.

20:09.526 --> 20:12.294
Went looking, but we
couldn't find him.

20:12.362 --> 20:13.412
What did this guy look like?

20:13.496 --> 20:15.664
Don't know, some <i>haole.</i>

20:15.731 --> 20:18.167
They all look alike.

20:18.234 --> 20:19.117
Yeah.

20:19.202 --> 20:20.619
All right,

20:20.703 --> 20:22.171
how many of those trip cameras
you got up there?

20:22.238 --> 20:23.572
Six.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.923
Ain't nobody get
near the grow

20:25.008 --> 20:26.175
without us putting
eyes on 'em.

20:26.242 --> 20:28.710
We need to see
that footage.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.878
<i>So Caetano said</i>

20:29.929 --> 20:32.798
that somebody else was
up there with Garcia, right?

20:32.866 --> 20:33.966
Did you get a description?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.634
Yeah, <i>haole--</i>
we all look alike.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.170
Lori, I need you to pull
footage off Caetano's cameras.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.572
I'm betting
our killer made a cameo.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.723
Okay, get right on it.

20:41.774 --> 20:42.941
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

20:43.026 --> 20:44.877
listen, she follows
orders, she likes sports.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.745
I mean, if she was
into blowing stuff up

20:46.813 --> 20:48.080
and romantic getaways

20:48.147 --> 20:51.116
at the DMZ, I'd say we are
looking at a love connection.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.601
That's funny.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.935
Garcia's wife give you anything?

20:53.987 --> 20:55.220
Yeah, he thought

20:55.288 --> 20:57.539
she was having an affair,
uh, but she wasn't.

20:57.607 --> 20:59.157
Okay, you just took
her word for it?

20:59.242 --> 21:00.993
Yeah, I did,
she seemed

21:01.077 --> 21:02.911
pretty upset
about her husband's murder.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.296
You get a name?

21:04.380 --> 21:06.164
Yeah, Nick Drayton.

21:06.249 --> 21:08.000
He manages
the Hula Room Bar and Grill,

21:08.084 --> 21:10.068
and I'm guessing
he is not the kind of guy

21:10.136 --> 21:11.920
to kill a SEAL
and make it look like suicide.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.229
Whoa.

21:21.931 --> 21:24.550
Evidence in a hit-and-run
over in Kailua.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.102
You heard
from Kono lately?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.571
Because she's not
returning my calls.

21:29.639 --> 21:30.989
I.A. investigation's got
her all turned around.

21:31.074 --> 21:32.441
You said on the phone
you had something?

21:32.492 --> 21:33.775
Yeah.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.043
Lab results
came back

21:35.111 --> 21:36.361
on that bottle you found
at the crime scene.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.784
So the bottle was
spiked with ketamine.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.987
It's a sedative used
to tranquilize horses.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.104
What about prints?

21:46.172 --> 21:47.406
The victim's and
another set of prints

21:47.473 --> 21:50.409
that we ran through the system
got a hit off a DUI pop.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.427
- Meet Nick Drayton.
- Wait a minute.

21:52.495 --> 21:54.129
Didn't Garcia think
his wife was having an affair

21:54.180 --> 21:55.297
with a guy called Nick Drayton?

21:55.348 --> 21:57.966
Yes.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.785
Ah.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.970
So you drug a Navy SEAL, and
you make it look like a suicide?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.605
- What are you talking about?
- All right, oh, oh, listen.

22:03.673 --> 22:05.524
We just want to know, was
his wife involved, yes or no?

22:05.608 --> 22:08.226
- No. Look...
- You, look, all right?

22:08.311 --> 22:09.344
What happened

22:09.395 --> 22:10.979
to your arm, huh?
Garcia do that?

22:11.030 --> 22:11.947
Huh? Huh?

22:12.014 --> 22:12.965
You're lucky
he didn't do more

22:13.032 --> 22:14.116
for sleeping with his wife.

22:14.183 --> 22:15.450
Hey, hold on!

22:15.518 --> 22:17.286
I didn't sleep
with his wife.

22:17.353 --> 22:19.237
Let's get
that straight.

22:19.322 --> 22:22.741
I went to see him
because Marissa's a friend,

22:22.825 --> 22:24.743
and she was going through
some tough times.

22:24.827 --> 22:26.378
I wanted to talk
some sense into him.

22:26.462 --> 22:28.363
Oh, that was nice of you.
How about you explain to me

22:28.414 --> 22:30.332
how your fingerprints got on a
bottle of whiskey that I found

22:30.383 --> 22:31.917
at the crime scene?
Explain that to me.

22:32.001 --> 22:33.552
How about the ketamine,
you slipped into his drink?

22:33.636 --> 22:35.304
Ketamine. What is that?

22:35.371 --> 22:36.638
It's the drug you
used to knock him out

22:36.706 --> 22:37.973
before you shot
him in the head.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.342
Listen, I told you guys.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.594
I went to see him
at his hotel room

22:42.679 --> 22:44.212
to talk some
sense into him.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.880
All right?
He'd been drinking.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.217
And I-I tried to take
the bottle away from him.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.569
Bad idea.

22:50.653 --> 22:55.157
I got a dislocated shoulder
for being a good Samaritan.

22:55.224 --> 22:57.159
I didn't kill him.

22:57.226 --> 22:59.227
I swear.

23:00.896 --> 23:02.497
Tell me something.

23:02.565 --> 23:03.699
You buy this guy's story?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.284
Yeah.

23:06.369 --> 23:07.703
That's it?
Just like that?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.504
Mm-hmm, yeah, pretty much.

23:09.572 --> 23:11.873
Okay, well, it still
doesn't explain how and why

23:11.924 --> 23:13.709
somebody would sneak
onto Garcia's camp site,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.578
drug him, shoot him
and make it look like a suicide.

23:16.629 --> 23:20.132
What's interesting to me is
that all this guy was doing...

23:20.216 --> 23:22.734
all he was doing was
trying to save his marriage.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.586
That's not what
got him killed, though.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.972
He did everything he could,
every single thing he could,

23:27.056 --> 23:28.190
and it just wasn't enough.

23:28.257 --> 23:29.641
Okay, who's marriage
are we talking about?

23:29.726 --> 23:31.343
I mean, he takes
a leave of absence,

23:31.411 --> 23:33.945
okay, to give it one
last try, but no, no.

23:34.030 --> 23:36.765
But see, me, if I would have
done that, I guarantee you

23:36.816 --> 23:38.900
Rachel and I would still
be together today, okay?

23:38.951 --> 23:41.236
I wouldn't be talking
on the phone to Gracie,

23:41.287 --> 23:43.321
telling her why Daddy only gets
to see her every other weekend.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.773
Why are you blaming yourself,
Danny?

23:48.110 --> 23:50.278
Max, what do you got?

23:50.329 --> 23:51.496
I think it would be a good idea

23:51.581 --> 23:52.947
for you to come down here
to the morgue.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.249
Why? What is it?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.386
And you should bring
Commander White with you, too.

23:57.453 --> 24:00.222
So who's this guy?

24:00.289 --> 24:02.123
A pickup truck went
over the bridge

24:02.175 --> 24:04.125
on H2 near the
North Shore.

24:04.177 --> 24:06.395
I thought it was going
to be another routine

24:06.462 --> 24:08.180
traffic accident autopsy,
but then

24:08.264 --> 24:09.798
I saw this.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.017
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:12.101 --> 24:13.968
Somebody want
to fill in the civilian?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.804
Yeah, yeah, Danny, this guy's
a member of SEAL Team Nine.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.106
Same as Petty
Officer Garcia.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.357
Yes, I remember it
from the autopsy,

24:19.442 --> 24:20.809
but I found
the coincidence

24:20.860 --> 24:21.943
just a little too much.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.312
Whoa, this guy died
in the car accident.

24:24.363 --> 24:28.250
Only it was made
to <i>look</i> like an accident.

24:31.788 --> 24:33.789
When an air bag deploys,

24:33.856 --> 24:35.757
it releases
hydroxide propellants.

24:35.825 --> 24:37.325
That's the stuff that makes

24:37.393 --> 24:38.794
your nose and
eyes watery

24:38.845 --> 24:40.796
if you're lucky enough
to survive the crash.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.932
He wasn't
lucky, Max.

24:43.999 --> 24:45.500
I had the lab pull the air bag.

24:46.969 --> 24:48.470
Hydroxide?

24:48.521 --> 24:51.005
Yes, even in traffic
fatalities such as this one,

24:51.057 --> 24:53.675
hydroxide is found
in the sinuses and the lungs.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.277
But when

24:55.344 --> 24:57.362
I autopsied,
the lungs were clear.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.649
Meaning he was dead
before the accident.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.851
Yes. Also found high
levels of ketamine

25:02.902 --> 25:04.736
in the blood, as
well as suspicious

25:04.821 --> 25:07.188
amounts of head trauma that
didn't match the amount

25:07.240 --> 25:09.190
of damage done
to the vehicle.

25:09.242 --> 25:11.293
Somebody is systematically

25:11.360 --> 25:13.795
knocking off the members
of SEAL Team Nine.

25:35.068 --> 25:38.638
Hells bells, Tolvin, put some
stick on 'em in my pool!

25:38.705 --> 25:40.473
It's not synchronized swimming.

25:40.541 --> 25:41.774
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:41.842 --> 25:43.576
Swim or die, boy.
Swim or die.

25:43.644 --> 25:46.329
You're getting soft
in your old age, Wade.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.664
Why don't you jump in the pool
and show 'em how it's done?

25:48.715 --> 25:52.201
Wade. Steve, this is CO
Wade Gutches, SD Team One.

25:52.252 --> 25:54.253
- Commander Steve McGarrett.
- Commander.

25:54.338 --> 25:55.704
Heard a lot about you
and your task force.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.706
You, too, sir.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.725
You got a minute
we can talk?

25:59.810 --> 26:02.044
Yeah, sure.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.352
What's up?

26:09.403 --> 26:11.887
Hoping you can help us
with a case.

26:11.939 --> 26:14.056
It involves
the SEALs.

26:14.107 --> 26:15.475
Is MP, provost marshal involved
in the investigation?

26:15.542 --> 26:16.659
Just Five-O, sir.

26:16.726 --> 26:19.162
Two teams guys
have already shown up dead.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.247
One was made to look
like a suicide,

26:21.331 --> 26:22.615
the other a car accident.

26:22.699 --> 26:24.167
Petty Officer Garcia

26:24.234 --> 26:25.401
didn't kill himself, though.

26:25.452 --> 26:26.569
He was murdered.

26:26.620 --> 26:27.620
And the other SEAL?

26:27.704 --> 26:30.122
Petty Officer Jamsek.

26:30.207 --> 26:31.457
He was killed last night, sir.

26:31.542 --> 26:33.092
Both men were members

26:33.177 --> 26:35.344
of SEAL Team Nine.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.683
Platoon is stationed on
the island for covert training.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.685
We have reason to believe, sir,

26:42.752 --> 26:44.103
these men are being targeted

26:44.188 --> 26:45.421
because of their involvement
with SEAL Team Nine.

26:45.472 --> 26:46.522
You know these guys

26:46.590 --> 26:47.773
better than anyone.

26:47.858 --> 26:49.942
Is it possible that a team
member has gone rogue

26:50.027 --> 26:51.444
and is out there
killing off SEALs?

26:51.528 --> 26:53.596
Nobody else knows
who they are, so...

26:53.647 --> 26:55.314
No, there's no way Navy
SEALs are behind this.

26:55.399 --> 26:56.816
Okay, well, that's why
we need the names

26:56.900 --> 26:58.284
of all the men
on that SEAL team.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.602
Oh, you know I'm not at liberty

26:59.653 --> 27:00.786
to give you that information.
It's classified.

27:00.871 --> 27:01.988
Sir, I understand
if you have

27:02.072 --> 27:03.439
to run this up the
chain of command,

27:03.490 --> 27:05.608
but I need to cross-reference
their after-action reports

27:05.659 --> 27:07.743
so I can work out who's
going after these boys, and why.

27:09.779 --> 27:11.714
Afraid I can't help you.

27:11.781 --> 27:14.000
Wade, we need
to end this

27:14.084 --> 27:15.751
before another one
of these men dies,

27:15.802 --> 27:17.670
and we can't do that
without your help.

27:17.754 --> 27:19.305
We owe them at least that, sir.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.291
Oh, you know that tiki bar

27:22.342 --> 27:24.644
I took you to
last time you were here?

27:24.728 --> 27:26.479
Sure do.

27:26.547 --> 27:27.980
et me there, 20 hundred.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.298
Don't be late.

27:29.349 --> 27:31.901
All right, ladies,

27:31.968 --> 27:34.153
bottom of the
pool, let's go.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.159
Where are we going?

27:57.210 --> 27:59.011
Come on.

28:18.298 --> 28:20.900
What, are we picking
up your boss's shirts?

28:20.984 --> 28:23.536
Oh, you're funny. Really.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.582
Gun.

28:43.707 --> 28:45.708
Two to you, Frank.

28:47.561 --> 28:49.562
Fold.

28:51.598 --> 28:53.599
Officer Kalakaua.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.604
Or should I say,
ex-officer Kalakaua?

28:59.656 --> 29:01.557
Kono's fine.

29:02.559 --> 29:04.893
Frank Delano.

29:04.945 --> 29:08.397
I'm sure you know
who I am, though.

29:08.448 --> 29:09.715
I've heard a few things.

29:09.783 --> 29:11.000
We're starting

29:11.068 --> 29:12.918
to a get reputation,
huh, Ray?

29:13.003 --> 29:15.788
Gonna have to do
something about that.

29:15.872 --> 29:17.807
I heard about you
on the force.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.410
That's ancient history.

29:21.461 --> 29:24.797
Moved on to greener pastures,
as they say.

29:24.881 --> 29:27.183
Much greener. Come.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.300
Sit.

29:32.139 --> 29:34.724
You want a drink?

29:34.775 --> 29:36.025
No, thanks.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.697
I don't trust cops
who don't drink.

29:41.765 --> 29:43.032
Especially ex-cops.

29:46.570 --> 29:48.070
So have a drink.

29:53.243 --> 29:55.711
To Captain Fryer.

29:57.748 --> 29:59.715
Don't worry.

29:59.783 --> 30:02.385
Fryer and his IA rat squad
will get theirs.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.453
Not soon enough.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.094
Listen, Kono,

30:12.145 --> 30:14.063
I don't want to

30:14.130 --> 30:16.232
sit around all day
and play footsie.

30:16.299 --> 30:19.985
A person with your skill
set and job experience has

30:20.070 --> 30:22.571
a certain value
in my line of work.

30:22.639 --> 30:24.690
And what kind of work is that?

30:26.443 --> 30:28.694
It's kind of like police work.

30:28.779 --> 30:31.197
Except the bad
guys we take down,

30:31.281 --> 30:33.115
we don't read Miranda.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.584
We just take their money.

30:35.652 --> 30:38.370
So you provide a public service.

30:38.455 --> 30:40.589
Something like that.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.177
So, why am I here?

30:45.262 --> 30:47.296
I have a job opening.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.515
What kind of job?

30:49.599 --> 30:53.636
Think I'd like
to ease you into it first.

30:55.522 --> 30:57.473
Provide us with
some information

30:57.524 --> 31:02.010
about an upcoming HPD raid,
and... we'll see how that goes.

31:05.649 --> 31:08.484
How do you expect me to get you
that kind of information?

31:08.535 --> 31:09.702
You're a...

31:09.786 --> 31:11.954
resourceful woman, Kono.

31:12.021 --> 31:14.623
You figure it out.

31:17.861 --> 31:19.845
Wade.

31:22.198 --> 31:24.300
Sorry about having
to shut you guys down earlier.

31:24.367 --> 31:25.835
Base is crawling
with navy intel.

31:25.886 --> 31:27.470
There's no need
to apologize.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.038
Had a serious
security breach recently.

31:30.090 --> 31:33.726
And SEAL Team Nine's
identities got compromised

31:33.810 --> 31:35.511
in the security breach,
didn't they?

31:35.562 --> 31:37.263
Among other things, yeah.

31:37.347 --> 31:38.848
But we think the hacker

31:38.899 --> 31:41.901
was targeting
this information specifically.

31:41.985 --> 31:44.019
And your investigation
confirms that.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.571
All right, when
did this happen?

31:45.655 --> 31:47.022
A week ago.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.658
Intel brass is trying to run
down the source of the breach.

31:49.726 --> 31:52.244
All right, well, it's definitely
connected to those murders.

31:52.329 --> 31:54.914
I mean, whoever stole that
list is picking off SEALs.

31:54.998 --> 31:57.566
I did run that up
the chain of command,

31:57.617 --> 31:59.668
and we are in the process
of locating

31:59.736 --> 32:03.205
and returning to base all
the active and reservist members

32:03.256 --> 32:04.707
of SEAL Team Nine,
and that, gentlemen,

32:04.758 --> 32:06.041
is all I can
tell you.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.293
Listen, we're
up and running

32:07.377 --> 32:08.511
on this investigation,
you understand?

32:08.578 --> 32:09.962
By the time the
provost marshal

32:10.046 --> 32:13.098
gets savvy, more SEALs could be
in danger, if not dead.

32:13.183 --> 32:14.834
Copy.

32:14.901 --> 32:17.186
But you, more than anybody,
should understand

32:17.253 --> 32:20.356
that I cannot compromise
an ongoing naval investigation.

32:20.423 --> 32:23.776
Now, I said,
I'll do what I can.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.228
Mm-hmm.

32:26.279 --> 32:28.280
Thanks for the beer.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.701
That was a
waste of time.

32:34.070 --> 32:36.805
Nice of him to leave us a little
reading material, though,

32:36.873 --> 32:38.874
even though
it's a year old.

32:48.385 --> 32:51.220
<i>Last June, Sinoloan Cartel,</i>

32:51.287 --> 32:52.755
headed by Rafa Alvaro,

32:52.806 --> 32:55.040
was raided by
a joint DEA task force.

32:55.108 --> 32:57.012
I, uh, I studied the
aerial surveillance

32:57.037 --> 32:58.237
photographs of the raid,

32:58.378 --> 33:01.597
and this thing has got the SEAL
Team Nine signature all over it.

33:01.648 --> 33:02.965
Textbook SEAL team
direct action.

33:03.016 --> 33:04.350
Well, Rafa's
brother Juan

33:04.434 --> 33:07.466
was not captured in the raid and
swore to avenge his brother's death.

33:07.467 --> 33:08.819
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
I thought the raid

33:08.822 --> 33:10.138
took out
the whole cartel.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.825
Juan was able to pull
the organization back.

33:12.893 --> 33:14.643
Of course, it helps
the cartel took in

33:14.694 --> 33:15.995
over $700 million last year.

33:16.079 --> 33:17.329
That money buys
a lot of breaching

33:17.414 --> 33:18.330
of covert SEAL team lists.

33:18.415 --> 33:19.415
And revenge.

33:19.482 --> 33:21.200
Source of mine
at NSA says

33:21.284 --> 33:23.118
the cartel hired a hacker
to break in

33:23.169 --> 33:24.503
to the supposedly secure
naval database.

33:24.588 --> 33:25.955
So the cartel steals

33:26.022 --> 33:28.540
a list of SEALs and sends
a hit man to knock 'em off?

33:28.625 --> 33:31.427
But does it in a way that
won't alert the others.

33:31.494 --> 33:33.012
Cartel sends in a pro.
