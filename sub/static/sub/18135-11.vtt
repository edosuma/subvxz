Listen up, Gotham City,

00:24.124 --> 00:27.025
get ready to tremble
at the magical might

00:27.060 --> 00:30.062
of the new,
improved Harley Quinn!

00:30.097 --> 00:31.997
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

(SCREAMING)

01:45.839 --> 01:47.439
(GROANING)

01:50.110 --> 01:52.277
I'm impressed, Batman.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.346
You have no
mystical abilities,

01:54.381 --> 01:57.048
yet you easily
defeated my bodyguards.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.617
BATMAN:
A criminal is a criminal.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.786
Monster or man,
they both fall the same.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.455
Smartly said.

02:03.490 --> 02:07.225
Now, are you smart enough
to stop turning criminals
into sorcerers?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.727
Careful, mortal.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.597
Challenge Brother Night
and you could get burned.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.704
Zatanna! You'll pay for that!

02:19.739 --> 02:21.973
Anytime you're ready,
dragon breath.

02:22.008 --> 02:26.378
Zatanna, Ember,
no fighting, please.
(CHUCKLING)

02:26.413 --> 02:29.481
I'm no criminal, Batman,
I choose no sides.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.983
I simply provide power
to those who...

02:32.018 --> 02:33.685
Crave it.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.153
For instance,

02:35.188 --> 02:38.823
I've always suspected
you've longed to be more
than what you are.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.793
With my help you'd no longer
need costumes and gadgets.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.063
You would become
crime's ultimate destroyer.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.133
A true agent of vengeance.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.701
Save your hocus pocus.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.337
And stop playing
fairy godfather
to Gotham Sleaze.

02:52.372 --> 02:55.440
I won't touch a living soul.
Promise.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.311
(CHANTS)

walk away unharmed.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.248
(GROANING)

03:04.284 --> 03:06.652
They won't be walking far.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.432
BATMAN: That could
have been worse.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.033
I don't often
deal with wizards.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.835
Don't underestimate yourself.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.571
Little secret.
When goblins wanna
scare themselves,

03:26.606 --> 03:28.607
they tell Batman stories.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.025
You spurned my generous offer.

04:20.060 --> 04:24.195
For that, you and Zatanna
are about to have the ride
of your lives.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.764
The last ride.

summon Etrigan now.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.052
No. And hello, Batman,

05:21.087 --> 05:22.787
good to see you again.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.956
The bat-mobile
nearly killed me.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.059
You want a mechanic.
Not a fiend from the pit.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.995
It's been possessed
by Brother Night.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.398
Oh, well,
then that's different.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.536

06:08.668 --> 06:11.736
I'll melt you down
by mystic fire!

trapped in there.
