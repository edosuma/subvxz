00:01.380 --> 00:03.220
- Ace McFumbles here
with a special

00:03.310 --> 00:05.110
Homecoming Week broadcast.

00:05.220 --> 00:06.689
On Saturday, our Bulldogs play

00:06.780 --> 00:09.110
their biggest game of the year
against crosstown rivals--

00:09.220 --> 00:12.290
the Cobras!

00:12.390 --> 00:15.730
Oh, yes, after last year's
crushing defeat,

00:15.830 --> 00:18.630
our Bulldogs are eager to win
back the hometown crown.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.770
And in social news,
the school is a-hum with mums--

00:21.870 --> 00:26.340
the Texas tradition of mum
corsages, that is.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.440
Remember, if someone
gives you one of these,

00:28.540 --> 00:31.740
you've got yourself a date
to the Homecoming Dance.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.300
- Last, but not least,
Homecoming Court nominees

00:35.410 --> 00:36.910
were just posted to the main
bulletin board.

00:37.010 --> 00:40.510
Let's go to Chauncy, our man on
the scene with the results.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.390
- I've gotta say...
the mood is electric.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.150
I'm afraid to look.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.160
- It's safe!
- We're all up there!

00:50.260 --> 00:52.000
PEPPER, BELLA, SOPHIE:

00:52.100 --> 00:53.830
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yay!

00:53.930 --> 00:55.230
- This is so cool!

00:55.330 --> 00:57.230
Now we'll all be in the yearbook
picture together.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.040
- Picture? Oh, no.
- What?

00:59.140 --> 01:00.110
- My zit nemesis is coming back.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.300
- You mean your nemezit?

01:03.410 --> 01:05.440
- Yes, the zit that wants
to ruin my life.

01:05.540 --> 01:06.970
It always shows up
at the worst time.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.350
- It's nothing.

01:09.450 --> 01:12.720
- Yeah, nothing at all.

01:12.820 --> 01:15.390
- Pepper, you're lying.
You always blink when you lie.

01:15.490 --> 01:16.920
I would never!

01:19.060 --> 01:20.630
- I'm out.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.830
I've gotta stick my face
in some zit cream.

01:22.930 --> 01:26.170
- It's all happening--the three
of us on Homecoming Court.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.490
And there's a dance.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.330
- I know.
I wish I had a date.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.990
But I haven't had a spark
with anyone since Kyle.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.600
It's probably for the best.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.170
I have to focus on
the Homecoming game.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.200
- Okay, don't tell anyone,

01:38.310 --> 01:41.350
but I've kinda had
a spark with someone.

01:41.450 --> 01:43.520
I'm hoping he'll give me a mum.
- Seriously? Who?

01:43.610 --> 01:45.440
- Oh, I'm dying to tell you.
Okay, it's--

01:45.550 --> 01:48.050
No, I can't.
I don't want to jinx it.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.720
- I totally understand.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.720
This is so exciting!

01:51.820 --> 01:54.030
- Ladies, relax.
I've worn this shirt before.

01:54.130 --> 01:58.360
- This is not about you, Troy.
This is about Homecoming.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.570
- Bella, Sophie and I got
elected to Homecoming Court

02:00.670 --> 02:02.230
and we're girling out hard.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.230
- Bella, I'm so
disappointed in you.

02:04.340 --> 02:06.170
You should be focused
on the game,

02:06.270 --> 02:07.310
not some outdated
popularity contest.

02:07.410 --> 02:10.410
- Troy, you got nominated
for Homecoming King.

02:10.509 --> 02:12.910
- What? Yes!
All right! I'm King!

02:13.010 --> 02:17.780
All hail King Troy! I did it!
Did you hear? I'm King!

02:17.880 --> 02:20.950
- Should we tell him
he hasn't won yet?

02:21.050 --> 02:22.120
- Let's let him have this.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.590
- ♪ Dreamlike, teamlike ♪

02:24.690 --> 02:27.330
♪ Livin' like
one of the boys ♪

02:31.830 --> 02:33.430
- This is the second time
you kids have come in

02:33.530 --> 02:35.670
for free sundaes this week.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.440
- Well, yeah, 'cause it
says it right here--

02:37.540 --> 02:39.570
"Free sundaes for athletes
wearing game jerseys

02:39.670 --> 02:40.940
during Homecoming Week."

02:41.040 --> 02:44.040
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean
unlimited sundaes--

02:44.140 --> 02:45.340
- Oh, should I call
my legal representative?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.670
Hello? Hey.

02:46.780 --> 02:49.150
- No. I just settled
a lawsuit.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.480
Some kid got his tongue
stuck on the soft-serve nozzle.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.310
Now I have to give him free
ice cream for life.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.430
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Faker!

03:00.520 --> 03:02.720
Here you go.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.800
- The only thing that tastes
better than free ice cream

03:04.900 --> 03:07.100
will be the sweet taste of
victory after Saturday's game.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.570
Hoo-rah!

03:08.670 --> 03:09.940
- That's what I'm
talking about.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.290
We're gonna crush those Cobras.

03:13.970 --> 03:16.480
- Oh, don't look now,
but the Cobras just walked in.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.070
- Where?
- I said don't look.

03:18.180 --> 03:21.080
- Right there.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.350
Grrrr...

03:22.450 --> 03:25.750
♪ ...eetings football foes ♪

03:25.850 --> 03:29.050
- Ha. Ha. Look,
it's the Bulldogs.

03:29.150 --> 03:31.080
- Can you believe these
guys have the guts

03:31.190 --> 03:32.120
to show their faces in here
after last year's game?

03:32.220 --> 03:35.980
- Oh, yeah? Well, uh,
these faces are gonna be

03:36.090 --> 03:38.250
in your nightmares after
we destroy you on Saturday.

03:38.360 --> 03:42.530
- Ha. Keep dreaming. We're goin'
all the way this year.

03:42.630 --> 03:46.030
We even ordered
our championship jackets.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.240
Oh!

03:48.340 --> 03:54.450
- Well, that's fine because, ha,
we don't even wear jackets.

03:54.550 --> 03:56.920
- You're wearing
a jacket right now.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.040
- Uh, no, no, this is...
this is a coat.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.790
I bought it, actually--
- What he meant was...

04:01.890 --> 04:02.590
we're gonna kick
your butts so hard,

04:02.690 --> 04:05.320
your grandkids will feel it.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.550
Oh...

04:06.660 --> 04:08.890
- Yeah, you Cobras are
going to be crushed.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.490
We're gonna skin
you snakes alive

04:10.590 --> 04:13.490
'cause mama needs
a new pair of boots!

04:13.600 --> 04:14.500
- Oh, yeah.
Mm-hm.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.200
- Whatever.
- That's what I thought.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.550
- Hey, you sure know
how to smack talk.

04:27.650 --> 04:28.910
- It's a gift.
- I'll say.

04:29.010 --> 04:30.540
You really put them
in their place.

04:30.650 --> 04:31.850
- Yeah, well, they deserved it.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.420
You mess with my team,
you answer to me.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.460
- I like a girl with attitude.
I'm Zach.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.450
- I'm Bella.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.390
I saw you play against
the Bears.

04:40.490 --> 04:41.790
You can really sling it.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.230
- I've heard that
said about me.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.230
- We should hang out sometime.
- Yes, we should.

04:46.330 --> 04:49.940
- Uh, how about Saturday night?
- That's cool.

04:50.030 --> 04:53.260
Oh, wait, Saturday's
our Homecoming Dance.

04:53.370 --> 04:56.210
- I mean, if you don't have
a date, I could go with you.

04:56.310 --> 04:59.750
I don't have a mum, but--
- Then you better go get one.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.940
That means "Yes," by the way.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.820
- Oh, cool.
All right, then, it's a date.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.340
See you then.
- Okay.

05:05.450 --> 05:09.760
- What did you say to him?
- Oh, my gosh, you guys, I--

05:09.850 --> 05:13.150
- Did you serve Zach Barnes
or did you soft serve him?

05:13.260 --> 05:15.860
- That was Zach Barnes
as in Cobra Captain

05:15.960 --> 05:19.330
and star linebacker Zach Barnes?
- The very same.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.600
You'll be seeing a lot of old
Barnesy come Saturday night.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.570
You know--when he's
tackling you.

05:23.670 --> 05:24.870
- I didn't know it was him.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.510
I guess I've never seen
him without a helmet.

05:27.610 --> 05:28.870
And he isn't even
wearing a jersey.

05:28.970 --> 05:32.970
- What a fool. Now he'll have
to pay for his ice cream.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.880
- Yeah, what a fool.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.850
- Yeah, that's what
I just said.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.190
Hey, you guys.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.230
Something kind of crazy happened
and I need your advice

05:48.330 --> 05:50.630
now that you're here. Is that
toothpaste on your cheek?

05:50.730 --> 05:52.760
- Yep, I heard it works on zits.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.390
- Well, if it doesn't,
nemezit will have fresh breath.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.170
- You were saying?

05:59.270 --> 06:01.110
- A guy asked me to the dance.
His name is Zach.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.980
He's tall and cute
and he likes my smack talk.

06:04.070 --> 06:07.170
Did I mention he's really cute?
- That's awesome!

06:07.780 --> 06:09.850
- But he's a Cobra.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.950
Wha-a-a-at?

06:12.050 --> 06:15.520
- It's his one flaw,
his one tiny, little...

06:15.620 --> 06:18.660
huge flaw.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.590
- Bella, you can't
date the enemy.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.560
- But, you guys...

06:22.660 --> 06:23.930
there was a spark.

06:24.030 --> 06:27.900
- Yeah, a spark that will burn
down the whole school.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.170
- Ooh, this is so romantic.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.940
You're gonna be involved
in a tragic love fire.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.470
- So you think it's
a good idea.

06:34.570 --> 06:36.680
- Well...no.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.700
- It's a terrible idea.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.680
And I think the whole school
would agree with us.

06:40.780 --> 06:42.750
Plus, what if
the team finds out?

06:42.850 --> 06:45.920
- Yeah, you're right.
What was I thinking?

06:46.020 --> 06:48.720
I've gotta go.
- Is that a mum for Sophie?

06:48.820 --> 06:50.760
- It is. My stepmom Brenda
helped me pick it out.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.690
She's really good at buying
showing things

06:52.790 --> 06:54.560
with my father's money.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.530
At least, that's what
my mother says.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.160
- It must be fancy.
- Yeah.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.730
It's got lots of
bells and whistles--literally.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.630
Plus, it's got lights

07:02.730 --> 07:04.630
and a little stuffed dog
that barks to music.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.170
Just enough without
going overboard.

07:06.270 --> 07:08.870
- There are a few things in this
world that just ain't natural--

07:08.970 --> 07:10.400
cheese from a can
and a mum from a store.

07:10.510 --> 07:14.080
That's why my mum is growing
in my garden as we speak.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.450
I'm waiting till tomorrow to
cut it so it's fresh,

07:15.550 --> 07:18.350
and it'll be mixed with
daisies--her favorite flower.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.920
- Wait, Sawyer, did you just say
you're giving someone a mum?

07:21.020 --> 07:23.820
- Yes. Yes, I am.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.390
- Well, aren't you full
of surprises, buster.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.730
Who's the lucky lady?

07:27.830 --> 07:30.300
- Let's just say that's
a surprise, too.

07:30.390 --> 07:34.660
That cowboy is a man of mystery.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.600
Oh, hey, Sophie.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.170
So, I know we discussed
this verbally

07:38.270 --> 07:40.470
and via text and email
and you said "No."

07:40.570 --> 07:43.210
But I was thinking, if you saw
it in person you might say--

07:43.310 --> 07:44.580
- No.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.580
- Okay, clearly I was mistaken.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.580
Catch ya later, Soph.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.550
Hey, Pepper.
- Hey.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.590
- Everything okay?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.310
- Not really.

07:55.420 --> 07:59.790
I was hoping a certain someone
was going to give me a mum.

07:59.890 --> 08:00.530
But it looks like
it's not going to happen.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.020
- Yes, it is.
Full disclosure.

08:05.130 --> 08:06.300
I bought this with
Sophie in mind,

08:06.400 --> 08:09.130
but she wasn't accepting
gifts at the moment.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.990
Pepper, my good pal,
will you accept my mum

08:11.100 --> 08:14.610
and go to the dance with me?

08:14.710 --> 08:17.880
- Sure, Newt.
I'd be happy to.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.210
- Oh, by the way,
if you get hungry,

08:19.310 --> 08:22.050
it's got edible petals.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.790
- Oh, hey.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.820
- Oh, hey, I got your text.
What's up?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.460
- I wanted to talk to
you about Saturday.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.429
I think you're really cool,
but I don't think we can go out.

08:35.530 --> 08:36.799
- Why not?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.850
- Because you're the enemy
and I don't want to

08:38.960 --> 08:41.590
burn down the school
in a tragic love fire.

08:41.700 --> 08:42.730
I mean...

08:42.830 --> 08:45.030
I'm a Bulldog
and you're a Cobra.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.870
We're at war.
We can't do this.

08:47.970 --> 08:49.340
- Look, I knew who you were
when I asked you out,

08:49.440 --> 08:51.680
and I didn't care,
so why should you?

08:51.780 --> 08:53.610
- Because it's more
complicated for me.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.810
- Because of the love fire?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.110
- No. Because I'm the only
girl on the team

08:58.220 --> 09:00.020
and the guys would
not understand.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.490
- Well, just don't tell them
until after the game.

09:02.590 --> 09:03.790
- Yeah, but what if--

09:03.890 --> 09:06.730
I mean, I could, but--

09:06.820 --> 09:08.650
They might--

09:08.760 --> 09:11.160
You know what?
That could work.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.060
- Okay, then. Problem solved.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.590
- Okay, I've gotta
go before they--

09:14.700 --> 09:16.670
Oh, no you didn't!

09:16.770 --> 09:18.770

in his place, Bella.

the ice cream,

some smack talk first.

bring your jersey.

Nemezit had a baby and it

Do you have any concealer
I can borrow?

11:28.030 --> 11:30.070
- I don't think
I should repeat it.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.800
It was super offensive.

Uh, so I went up to Zach
and I was like...

11:43.410 --> 11:45.770
"You Cobras are the worst."
- Oh!

11:45.880 --> 11:47.110
- And he was like...

11:47.220 --> 11:49.250
"You Bulldogs are even worser."

11:49.350 --> 11:50.680
And I was like..."Pssssh."

12:10.140 --> 12:12.340

12:12.440 --> 12:13.580

12:13.680 --> 12:15.580
- At least someone has
a date to the dance.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.620
- Bella has a new guy.
- Guys, you know what?

12:17.710 --> 12:20.110
I think I'll just open this
in my locker--privately.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.650
Troy, don't!
- Let's see.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.650
"A mum with attitude
for a girl with attitude."

12:25.760 --> 12:27.430

- Whoa.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.590

the dance--Zach Barnes"?

12:32.100 --> 12:36.700
- So, about my date...

12:41.060 --> 12:43.890
- Coach, there has to be
some rule against this.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.860
Isn't there a penalty
for, you know, traitor dating?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.360
- Yeah, I don't know.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.590
I've never had a player date
an opponent before.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.930

get outta here.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.980
- Guys, this is not a big deal.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.910
Zach and I are just two people
from opposite sides who met,

13:04.010 --> 13:07.580
smack talked and liked each
other--like Romeo and Juliet.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.490

that ended well.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.410
- Newt, you're with
me, aren't you?

going on here?

13:18.330 --> 13:20.100

game of the season.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.750
- Yeah, I mean,
it's a great strategy.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.670
If the Cobras had a girl QB,
I'd do the same.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.020

20:33.660 --> 20:36.200
Yeah, they will.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.470
But, you know, I'll save
a ton on gift baskets.

20:40.270 --> 20:42.900
- And now, the moment we've
all been waiting for.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.300
- Oh, that's us.
- Let's go.

20:46.410 --> 20:50.210
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm proud to announce

20:50.310 --> 20:53.950
Silverado's new Homecoming
King and Queen--

20:54.050 --> 20:56.950
Troy Dixon and Bella Dawson!

21:02.190 --> 21:06.590
- Yes, I did it!
Congratulations to me.

21:06.690 --> 21:08.590
Oh, yeah. You, too, Bella.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.670
- Thanks, Troy.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.260
Nice crown.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.700
- Yeah, I was hoping
it would be bigger.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.270
Shall we go to the dance,
Your Highness?

21:16.370 --> 21:19.140
- We shall, Your Majesty.
Let's hang.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.010
- Okay, but I'm keeping
it casual.

21:27.050 --> 21:28.280
- One more minute until
I can wake up

21:28.380 --> 21:30.720
from this free
ice cream nightmare.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.450
- Bulldogs in the house!

21:32.550 --> 21:34.560
- Hey, hey, the promotion
is almost over,

21:34.650 --> 21:37.820
and by the time you go home
and get your jerseys,

21:37.920 --> 21:39.150
it'll be too late.

21:39.260 --> 21:41.630
- Oh, well, then it's a good
thing we brought 'em.

21:41.730 --> 21:44.030
- Great.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.900
- I'll have two sundaes--
one for me and one for my date.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.600
- Friend!
- Friend-date with Sophie.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.730
- Um, Bernie?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.980
- Get outta here, kid.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.450
- I'm stuck on here, Daddy.

21:59.305 --> 22:05.481
