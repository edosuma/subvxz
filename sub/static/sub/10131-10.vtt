08:03.650 --> 08:05.819
little girls

08:03.650 --> 08:05.819
in the world" look.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.950
That may work

08:10.449 --> 08:11.950
for you, girls

08:11.992 --> 08:14.411
but I don't have

08:11.992 --> 08:14.411
those cute little dimples.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.578
Well, maybe if you put a..

08:15.620 --> 08:16.746
...pretty little bow

08:15.620 --> 08:16.746
in your hair

08:16.788 --> 08:17.914
or something..

08:19.874 --> 08:20.959
Not funny.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.377
Danny's coming up the steps!

08:22.419 --> 08:23.962
Come on.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.672
- What do we do?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.672
- Okay, here's the plan.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.257
First, we hide

08:25.713 --> 08:27.257
the seat covers.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.718
Hide the seat covers.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.718
Alright. Now what?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.221
Look, it's tough enough

08:30.760 --> 08:33.221
for Danny turning 30.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.764
It's his birthday,

08:33.263 --> 08:34.764
and you gotta promise me

08:34.806 --> 08:35.932
you're not

08:34.806 --> 08:35.932
gonna ruin it for him.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.058
Okay, I promise.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.352
Then we have to make sure that

08:38.393 --> 08:39.519
he has the best time

08:38.393 --> 08:39.519
he's ever had

08:39.560 --> 08:40.603
in his entire life.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.646
Good. We'll do that.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.106
Then, in the afterglow

08:43.148 --> 08:44.191
you'll set him down

08:44.232 --> 08:46.360
and gently

08:44.232 --> 08:46.360
rip his heart out.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.404
Can't you come up

08:47.819 --> 08:49.404
with a happier ending?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.156
Yeah, the car fairy shows up

08:51.198 --> 08:52.699
and makes everything wonderful.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.246
- Shh! Quiet, everyone.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.246
- 'Let's see.'

08:58.288 --> 09:00.748
15 of my friends' cars

08:58.288 --> 09:00.748
parked right out front.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.667
I wonder..

09:02.709 --> 09:06.129
(together)

09:02.709 --> 09:06.129
Surprise!

09:06.171 --> 09:08.131
I don't believe this.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.550
(together)

09:08.173 --> 09:10.550
Happy birthday!

09:10.591 --> 09:11.801
Thank you, thank you.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.261
This is great.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.261
I love this.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.096
Everybody's here.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.096
This is so nice.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.681
All my friends from

09:15.138 --> 09:16.681
the station are here.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.100
Are we running

09:16.723 --> 09:19.100
a test pattern tonight?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.560
Cousin Ed!

09:20.601 --> 09:22.145
Oh, Cousin Ed.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.439
Caroline, why aren't you out

09:22.187 --> 09:24.439
running your fishing boat?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.526
Oh, what, and miss your

09:24.481 --> 09:27.526
19th birthday party?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.070
I am so glad you're here.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.697
Daddy, would you care

09:30.111 --> 09:32.697
for some cheese?

09:32.739 --> 09:36.159
Oh, yes, Stephanie.

09:32.739 --> 09:36.159
Thank you.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.618
This is too easy.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.246
I'm ready for dip.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.957
Oh, there you are,

09:40.414 --> 09:42.957
you birthday nuts.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.584
I thought

09:42.999 --> 09:44.584
I told you<i> no party.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:46.127
Oh, you say that every year.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.088
This is the last

09:46.169 --> 09:48.088
surprise, isn't it?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.965
Well.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.300
Danny, I just

09:51.007 --> 09:52.300
want you to know

09:52.342 --> 09:53.968
that Jesse deserves

09:52.342 --> 09:53.968
all the credit.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.763
This whole party was his idea

09:54.010 --> 09:56.763
because he loves you.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.848
- Right.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.848
- Always remember that.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.517
Please.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.436
Oh, Jesse, I know you hate

10:00.559 --> 10:02.436
when I hug you--

10:02.477 --> 10:03.937
Hey, I got an idea.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.646
It's your birthday.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.646
What the heck.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.857
Why don't I hug you

10:05.688 --> 10:07.857
this time, huh?

10:07.899 --> 10:09.568
Brother-in-law.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.652
Say cheese.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.154
- Cheese!

10:16.741 --> 10:19.869
We'll call this

10:16.741 --> 10:19.869
the "before" picture.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.373
Open that one.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.666
Now, Danny,

10:24.374 --> 10:25.666
if you don't like it

10:25.708 --> 10:27.127
there's now way

10:25.708 --> 10:27.127
I can return it

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
so you'd

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
better like it.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.714
Oh.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.468
Caroline,

10:31.756 --> 10:34.468
this is great.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.261
The last time Danny went

10:34.509 --> 10:36.261
fishing on my boat

10:36.303 --> 10:37.554
he didn't catch a thing

10:37.596 --> 10:39.180
so I mounted his bait.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.393
Hey, I'm just out there

10:40.723 --> 10:43.393
for the fresh air.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.353
Daddy, I found

10:43.435 --> 10:45.353
another present.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.355
- No, no.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.689
You never saw me.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.568
Aw, the gifts

10:48.731 --> 10:51.568
just keep on coming.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.487
Look at this,

10:51.610 --> 10:53.487
"from Jesse and Joey

10:53.528 --> 10:55.447
to Bullet and Danny."

10:55.489 --> 10:57.449
'Oh, great.'

10:57.491 --> 10:58.699
Wow!

10:58.741 --> 11:01.620
Sheepskin seat covers

10:58.741 --> 11:01.620
for Bullet.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.787
I could cry.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.581
Oh, you will.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.668
I'm gonna go try

11:06.500 --> 11:08.668
these on right now.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.838
Uh, excuse me.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.382
I think now would be

11:11.879 --> 11:14.382
a good time to tell him.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.218
Whoa, Danny, Danny.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.219
Listen, before you go out there

11:18.261 --> 11:20.054
I wanna tell you something.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.765
Bullet was in an accident.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.644
Is he alright?

11:25.684 --> 11:28.271
No. Listen,

11:25.684 --> 11:28.271
this is what happened.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.772
I'm coming out

11:28.313 --> 11:29.772
of Pep Boys, right?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.690
With your wonderful yet

11:31.732 --> 11:33.610
essentially useless party gift

11:33.652 --> 11:35.903
and this idiot plowed into

11:33.652 --> 11:35.903
the back of Bullet, right?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.322
It sends him down the hill

11:37.364 --> 11:39.240
through this guard rail,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.240
into the air

11:39.282 --> 11:40.825
where he did

11:39.282 --> 11:40.825
kind of a full gainer.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.369
He lands in the bay

11:42.410 --> 11:45.288
and sank...like a stone.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.875
But look, Bullet went out

11:45.330 --> 11:48.875
with a blaze of glory.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.002
[laughing]

11:53.213 --> 11:54.922
For a second,

11:53.213 --> 11:54.922
you had me going.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.467
He sank to the

11:54.964 --> 11:57.467
bottom of the bay.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.801
You know what a car

11:57.509 --> 11:58.801
would look like

11:58.843 --> 12:00.845
if it sank to the

11:58.843 --> 12:00.845
bottom of the bay?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.263
[laughing]

12:21.366 --> 12:24.160
We'll call this

12:21.366 --> 12:24.160
the "after" picture.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.422
Daddy,

12:33.169 --> 12:35.422
are you alright?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.215
[laughing]

12:37.257 --> 12:38.757
Of course, sweetheart.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.594
I'm fine.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.721
That's the same smile

12:40.635 --> 12:42.721
Jack Nicholson had

12:42.761 --> 12:44.180
in "The Shining."

12:45.932 --> 12:48.309
Maybe it just needs

12:45.932 --> 12:48.309
a little touch-up paint.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.729
Look, Danny, listen,

12:48.351 --> 12:50.729
I'm gonna make this up to you.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.607
I promise.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.607
I accept all responsibility.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.024
Even though it was

12:53.648 --> 12:55.024
actually the fault

12:55.066 --> 12:56.234
of the Spanish missionaries

12:56.276 --> 12:58.236
for being so dumb

12:56.276 --> 12:58.236
to build a city

12:58.278 --> 13:00.029
on so many hills

12:58.278 --> 13:00.029
that go--

13:00.071 --> 13:01.864
Hey, pal, I'm fine.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.782
These things happen.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.619
<i>Que sera sera.</i>

13:05.660 --> 13:07.328
Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.872
Life goes on. Rah.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.708
(Jesse)

13:09.914 --> 13:11.708
'Danny, drop the act.'

13:11.750 --> 13:13.543
Every weekend you're out

13:11.750 --> 13:13.543
here polishing this thing

13:13.585 --> 13:14.753
waxing this thing.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.338
It's ruined.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.338
The outside's ruined.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.881
The inside's ruined.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.218
The handle's actually

13:20.383 --> 13:22.218
in good shape.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.430
Jesse, it's not about

13:25.472 --> 13:26.889
the hundreds of hours of labor

13:26.931 --> 13:29.016
he poured into this car.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.311
It's about 10 years

13:29.058 --> 13:31.311
of memories.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.648
Danny, this car was with you

13:34.689 --> 13:36.566
through the tough years.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.026
It drove you to

13:36.608 --> 13:39.026
your first real job.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.987
Then it helped you

13:39.068 --> 13:40.987
raise a family.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.864
Man, this car

13:41.028 --> 13:43.864
was your 20s.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.411
That's good. We lost the phony

13:45.408 --> 13:48.411
smile. Very good. Alright.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.622
Now what you gotta do is

13:48.453 --> 13:50.622
get in touch with your anger.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.791
Let it all out. Hit me.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.791
Go ahead. Hit me.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.709
No, I got a better idea.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.709
Hit the car, hit the car.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.294
Hit the...kick the car.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.045
Let it go, let it go,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.045
let it go, let it go.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.172
Go ahead.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.135
Doesn't that

14:02.592 --> 14:04.135
feel better, huh?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.261
Feels good, right?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.055
I can honestly say

14:08.097 --> 14:11.434
that this is one birthday

14:08.097 --> 14:11.434
I will never forget.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.978
Goodnight.

14:14.771 --> 14:15.896
Goodnight, girls.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.315
(together)

14:15.938 --> 14:17.315
Goodnight.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.776
Oh, and thank you very much

14:19.818 --> 14:21.902
for the lovely seat covers.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.782
Probably not the best time

14:25.824 --> 14:27.283
for birthday cake.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.745
[instrumental music]

14:34.123 --> 14:36.501
Look, honey, it's Mr. Dog.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.670
What does Mr. Dog say?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.046
Woof, woof.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.841
I may be holding the first

14:40.087 --> 14:42.841
woman president.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.009
Yes. Look. It's Mr. Pig.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.220
What does Mr. Pig say?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.346
Boof.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.764
Close enough.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.140
Let's go for three.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.477
Oh. Oh.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.187
It's Mr. Car.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.940
What does Mr. Car say?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.735
You're right.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.319
He doesn't say anything.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.905
Because he's dead.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.993
Good morning. How

15:09.242 --> 15:10.993
are you guys doing?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.328
What are you

15:11.035 --> 15:12.328
doing up so early?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.414
I thought I heard

15:12.370 --> 15:14.414
Michelle crying.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.249
No. That was me.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.042
- Can I hold her?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.042
- Sure.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.711
Come here, sweetie.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.464
Come on, buddy. Cheer up.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.091
It's just a car.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.802
Actually, it's a big

15:25.132 --> 15:27.802
wet lawn sculpture.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.847
Come on, I dare you

15:30.889 --> 15:33.391
to look at this baby

15:30.889 --> 15:33.391
and not smile.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
Hi, daddy.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
It's me, it's me.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.270
It's me, it's me!

15:37.311 --> 15:40.648
Cheer up. There you go.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.648
Atta boy.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.859
See, now who cares

15:40.690 --> 15:42.859
about a car?

15:44.527 --> 15:48.114
Aw, Joey, it's more

15:44.527 --> 15:48.114
than just the car.

15:48.155 --> 15:51.325
I'm talking

15:48.155 --> 15:51.325
about the big picture.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.827
Who are we?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.161
Where are we going?

15:54.203 --> 15:56.956
And why do we have to

15:54.203 --> 15:56.956
get there so fast?

15:56.997 --> 15:58.207
We're Joey and Danny

15:58.249 --> 15:59.918
and we're going down

15:58.249 --> 15:59.918
into the kitchen

15:59.959 --> 16:01.795
and we're going there fast

15:59.959 --> 16:01.795
because if we don't

16:01.836 --> 16:03.963
Jesse will eat all

16:01.836 --> 16:03.963
the microwave pancakes.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.508
Do you remember back

16:05.465 --> 16:07.508
in junior high school

16:07.550 --> 16:09.719
when we had wood shop

16:07.550 --> 16:09.719
with old man Pathco?

16:09.761 --> 16:13.598
Ha ha! Yeah, I remember

16:09.761 --> 16:13.598
that old geezer.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.725
Joey, old man Pathco was 27.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.771
It seems like just yesterday

16:18.018 --> 16:19.771
you were saying to me

16:19.813 --> 16:21.689
"Danny, I wonder

16:19.813 --> 16:21.689
what it's like out there

16:21.731 --> 16:25.359
in the real world? Getting

16:21.731 --> 16:25.359
a job, being a grown-up."

16:25.401 --> 16:26.945
I did say that yesterday.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.574
- Hello.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.574
- Hey, Jess.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.326
Jess, it's alright. Come on in.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.995
Hello, Michelle.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.246
Come here,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.246
come here.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.750
You still mad at me?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.627
Oh, I know what happened

16:40.792 --> 16:42.627
wasn't your fault.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.712
Alright, listen. I'm gonna make

16:42.669 --> 16:44.712
it up to you, man. I promise.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.339
Joseph, go get dressed.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.339
We're taking a ride.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.674
Where are we going?

16:47.715 --> 16:48.925
Are you gonna

16:47.715 --> 16:48.925
be home today?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.802
Where am I going?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.802
I got no car.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.137
And I'm an old man

16:50.844 --> 16:53.137
who just turned..

16:53.179 --> 16:54.388
...I just turned..

16:54.430 --> 16:55.890
(together)

16:54.430 --> 16:55.890
30.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.851
- Thank you.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.851
- You stay right here.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.059
I got a big

16:57.892 --> 16:59.059
surprise for you.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.436
Oh, please,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.436
no more surprises.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.855
No, no. This surprise

17:00.478 --> 17:01.855
you are gonna love.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.481
- Come on, Joey.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.481
- Okay.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.317
Oh! Wait. One more

17:03.523 --> 17:06.317
for the road.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.280
Irresistible. I can't keep

17:08.528 --> 17:11.280
my lips off her tummy.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.992
[blowing a raspberry]

17:14.033 --> 17:15.618
He's right.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.618
You're habit-forming.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.962
- Yes!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.962
- Alright!

17:26.004 --> 17:28.506
Whoo! Look at this car.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.506
The same color.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.257
This thing looks

17:28.548 --> 17:30.257
just like Bullet.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.259
Alright!

17:32.301 --> 17:34.136
Thank you.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.136
I'll see you on Sunday.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.973
This is Bullet's twin brother.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.224
How did you find him?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.767
Simple, I picked up

17:38.265 --> 17:39.767
the phone and dialed

17:39.809 --> 17:42.186
every dealer

17:39.809 --> 17:42.186
in northern California.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.438
But it doesn't matter.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.438
I found you.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.232
I found you!

17:46.273 --> 17:47.567
Why am I talking to you?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.235
Yes, we're going

17:47.608 --> 17:49.235
to buy you

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
and we're gonna

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
take you home

17:50.486 --> 17:52.655
and Danny's

17:50.486 --> 17:52.655
gonna be so happy.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.492
Oh, we did it.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.536
Joe, Joe, Joe,

17:56.534 --> 17:58.536
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.913
It's gonna be

17:58.578 --> 17:59.913
quite difficult

17:59.954 --> 18:01.622
to get a good price

17:59.954 --> 18:01.622
for the car

18:01.664 --> 18:03.374
if you're actually

18:01.664 --> 18:03.374
kissing the car.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.004
- Right. Right.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.004
- Listen. This is important.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.882
Danny's getting 11,700

18:08.046 --> 18:10.882
from the insurance company.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.676
The important thing

18:10.924 --> 18:13.676
is we get this car for 11-7.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.886
Excuse me, is there something

18:14.928 --> 18:16.470
I can help you

18:14.928 --> 18:16.470
fine gentlemen with?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.723
Oh, I don't know.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.723
We're just browsing around.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.140
You know, browsing,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.140
lookin' at the cars.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.392
Well, how about this one?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.977
I mean, what's the

18:21.434 --> 18:22.977
story on Bullet..

18:23.019 --> 18:24.562
...on this car here?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.605
12 grand.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.814
[telephone rings]

18:26.856 --> 18:27.982
12 grand.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.568
I wouldn't pay a nickel

18:28.024 --> 18:30.568
over 11-7.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.449
Paul's classic cars.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.449
Paul himself. We got you.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.951
You guys aren't

18:36.490 --> 18:37.951
gonna believe this

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
but I've got a guy

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
on the phone right now

18:39.953 --> 18:41.287
who's offering 12 grand

18:41.328 --> 18:44.415
for that car, sight unseen.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.708
He's bluffing us, Joseph.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.919
Watch me. I'll play into it.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.504
Uh, 11-7, Paul.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.881
(Jesse)

18:50.546 --> 18:51.881
'Okay, fine.'

18:51.923 --> 18:53.424
No 11-7, we're

18:51.923 --> 18:53.424
walking out the door

18:53.466 --> 18:54.842
and we ain't

18:53.466 --> 18:54.842
coming back.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.260
He'll stop us. Watch.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.055
Goodbye, Paul.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.055
We'll see you, Paul.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.682
- We're gone.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.682
- Bye-bye, Paulie.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.517
- We're already out the door.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.517
- We're gone, man.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.603
- We're gone.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.603
- Bye-bye, Paulie.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.063
<i>Adios,</i> Paul.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.648
Congratulations, sir.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.691
When can you come down

19:08.689 --> 19:10.691
and pick it up?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.026
Hi, Paul.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.695
- 12-1.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.695
- I'm sorry, sir.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.115
I just received

19:14.737 --> 19:17.115
an offer of 12-1.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.825
I'll give you 12,500.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.326
Go, dad! Keep going!

19:20.994 --> 19:22.411
$12,500.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.872
- 13,000.

19:24.914 --> 19:25.957
14,000.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.750
I'll kick in an extra 20.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.919
Count me in

19:27.792 --> 19:29.919
for 73 cents.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.840
They're up

19:30.837 --> 19:33.840
to $14,020.73.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.008
We got to get Danny this car.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.302
$14,020.75.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.637
We got him on the ropes.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.389
$14,020.75.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.142
What's he up to, dad?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.019
He went up 2 cents.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.561
I got a loose tooth.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.272
Whatever the tooth fairy

19:47.603 --> 19:50.272
gives me, it's yours.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.150
15,000.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.861
I got 15,000. 15,000.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.861
Do I hear 16,000?

19:54.902 --> 19:58.238
- 16,000.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.238
- 17, 000!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.782
I got $17,000.

19:59.824 --> 20:00.825
No, no, that doesn't count.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.160
The yahoo bird bid against me.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.370
Too late.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.370
He's up to 18,000 now.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.582
You tell him that I'm gonna pay

20:05.830 --> 20:08.582
anything for that car.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.127
I'm gonna pay 20,000 bucks.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.252
$20,000.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.339
$20,000?

20:15.381 --> 20:18.092
I'm going crazy over

20:15.381 --> 20:18.092
a car I haven't even seen.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.553
Look, I got to send

20:18.134 --> 20:20.553
my daughters to college.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.096
It's only a car.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.973
Let the other guy have it.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.059
He went up another thousand.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.896
But I think

20:27.185 --> 20:29.896
that car can be yours

20:29.937 --> 20:32.106
for only $22,000.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.192
[sighs]

20:34.233 --> 20:38.196
We went from 11-7

20:34.233 --> 20:38.196
to $22,000.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.907
How are we gonna

20:39.072 --> 20:40.907
pay that?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.825
You know how many jokes

20:40.948 --> 20:42.825
I have to tell?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.452
You know how many bugs

20:42.867 --> 20:45.452
I have to kill?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.538
We'll just get Danny's

20:45.494 --> 20:47.538
car somewhere else.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.208
Give it to the other guy.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.835
Boys, boys, boys.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.835
Let's not be hasty here.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.962
Did I say $22,000?

20:55.004 --> 20:57.048
I actually meant 21.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.051
20. 19?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.429
How about 11-5, Paul?

21:04.513 --> 21:05.723
Sold.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.850
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

21:08.726 --> 21:09.727
Can I interest you boys

21:09.769 --> 21:11.062
in an extended

21:09.769 --> 21:11.062
service contract?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.563
Write up the car, Paul.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.191
Danny! Daniel!

21:15.233 --> 21:17.193
Hey, guys.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.193
I am glad you're here.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.237
- I've got some great news.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.237
- So do we.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.239
- Let me tell you mine first.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.239
- Okay.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.907
Do you remember

21:21.280 --> 21:22.907
when I thought

21:22.949 --> 21:25.659
the only car I could

21:22.949 --> 21:25.659
ever love was Bullet?

21:25.701 --> 21:26.869
- Yep.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.869
- Uh-huh.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.537
Well, I was wrong.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.664
Wouldn't I look good

21:28.579 --> 21:30.664
behind the wheel

21:30.706 --> 21:32.583
of a Jeep Wagoneer?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.586
(Danny)

21:33.793 --> 21:35.586
'Look at this.'

21:35.628 --> 21:37.755
'Rear track lock differential'

21:37.797 --> 21:38.798
'self-sealing radials'

21:38.839 --> 21:40.967
anti-theft ignition.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.385
I can't wait to find out

21:41.008 --> 21:43.385
what these things mean.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.847
You can't be serious.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.182
Of course I am.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.850
In fact, I even

21:48.224 --> 21:49.850
called a dealership today

21:49.892 --> 21:50.893
and started bidding on a car

21:50.935 --> 21:52.979
that was exactly like Bullet.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.438
And there was

21:53.020 --> 21:54.438
this other yo-yo there

21:54.480 --> 21:56.523
that kept hiking up

21:54.480 --> 21:56.523
the price.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.151
(Joey)

21:56.565 --> 21:58.151
'It was crazy.'

21:58.192 --> 22:01.779
So, I just said,

21:58.192 --> 22:01.779
bye-bye Bullet.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.990
I went car shopping.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.700
And guys, I fell in love.

22:06.742 --> 22:11.497
So tomorrow I am buying

22:06.742 --> 22:11.497
my first new car ever.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.790
I hope you're not

22:11.538 --> 22:12.790
planning on using

22:12.832 --> 22:14.708
your insurance check.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.585
What are you

22:14.750 --> 22:16.585
talking about?

22:16.627 --> 22:17.795
That was

22:16.627 --> 22:17.795
our little surprise.

22:17.837 --> 22:21.257
We, uh...got you

22:17.837 --> 22:21.257
a birthday gift.

22:21.882 --> 22:22.967
Take a look.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.682
Aww.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.895
You two were the yo-yos?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.648
- Yo.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.568
I love that car.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.612
I thought you just said

22:41.610 --> 22:43.612
"bye-bye Bullet."

22:43.654 --> 22:45.239
To the old Bullet.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.074
You have to

22:45.281 --> 22:47.074
move on in life.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.451
So, move on

22:47.116 --> 22:49.451
to your Wagoneer.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.704
Hey, what better symbol

22:49.493 --> 22:51.704
for the next decade

22:51.745 --> 22:54.456
than a gift

22:51.745 --> 22:54.456
from my two best friends?

22:54.498 --> 22:56.167
Birthdays aren't

22:54.498 --> 22:56.167
about numbers.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.376
They're about

22:56.209 --> 22:58.376
who you spend them with.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.338
You guys made

22:58.418 --> 23:00.338
this one great.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.464
You really want

23:00.378 --> 23:02.464
to keep the car?

23:02.506 --> 23:04.342
Absolutely.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.093
Thank you.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.594
(Jesse and Joey)

23:06.135 --> 23:07.594
Happy birthday.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.388
- Again.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.558
You know what

23:10.430 --> 23:12.558
really feels nice?

23:12.599 --> 23:14.310
For the first time

23:14.352 --> 23:16.770
it feels great to be..

23:16.812 --> 23:17.771
...30.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.566
- He said it!

23:17.813 --> 23:20.566
- Oh, yes.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.860
So what are you gonna

23:20.607 --> 23:22.860
name him? Bullet, Jr.?

23:22.902 --> 23:26.655
Come on, Joey. A 30-year-old man

23:22.902 --> 23:26.655
doesn't name his car.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.741
Go get the kids.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.741
Let's go for a spin.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.950
Alright.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.119
(Jesse)

23:30.784 --> 23:32.119
'Stephanie.'

23:32.161 --> 23:33.495
(Joey)

23:32.161 --> 23:33.495
'D.J.'

23:35.873 --> 23:37.333
I'll be right back..

23:37.375 --> 23:38.625
...Walter.
