WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.049
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

00:06.093 --> 00:08.399
Command closed the Nigeria
inquiry. I'm clear, babe.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.053
<i>
This isn't</i> <i>
how I wanted parenthood</i>

00:10.097 --> 00:11.663
to start for us. <i>
Do you even think</i>

00:11.707 --> 00:12.795
<i>you're in love with me?</i>

00:12.838 --> 00:14.144
What are you saying right now?

00:14.188 --> 00:15.885
I think Leanne and I
should move on.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.278
<i>What's wrong?</i> <i>
I just got</i>

00:17.321 --> 00:18.757
a lot on my plate right now.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.064
Maybe we shouldn't book
this room for a while.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.500
Yeah. <i>
Breaks my heart</i>

00:22.544 --> 00:24.154
seeing you retreat back
into your

00:24.198 --> 00:26.678
miserable three-foot world.
Don't worry about reaching out.

00:26.722 --> 00:30.073
Jason's gonna do what he wants
to do, regardless of your input.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.684
<i>Be careful.</i> <i>
You've</i> <i>been called here today</i>

00:32.728 --> 00:35.513
for an Omega operation
in South America.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.688
No backstop, no footprint.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.342
You will be on your own.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.953
Bravo Team, welcome to Colombia.
Your operations

00:40.997 --> 00:42.259
will be over the border.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.087
<i>- Venezuela.</i>
- Dr. Francisco Guillen

00:44.131 --> 00:46.437
is developing
a nuclear weapons program.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.309
A kill of Guillen will strike
a fatal blow to it.

00:48.352 --> 00:51.051
What if there's more to the
nuclear program than Guillen?

00:51.094 --> 00:52.574
Capture may be
the better option.

00:52.617 --> 00:53.662
Not worth the risk.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.098
You and I aren't the only ones

00:55.142 --> 00:56.882
seeing that capture's
the smarter play here.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.884
My vote is to not start
Bravo Civil War on day one.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.886
<i>
Just because you didn't get</i> <i>
your way with the op plan</i>

01:00.930 --> 01:02.453
doesn't mean
you need to micromanage me.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.064
What would happen to us if
Bravo 6 wasn't here

01:04.107 --> 01:06.066
to save us all. <i>
Who are these guys?</i>

01:06.109 --> 01:09.330
<i>
FRS just identified them</i> <i>
as Iranian nationals.</i>

01:09.373 --> 01:11.506
If they're here,
the Venezuelan program is real.

01:11.549 --> 01:14.900
Hey, your head is not right,
and it hasn't been for months.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.902
That's your fuckin' play?
Stick me with TBI,

01:16.946 --> 01:18.948
so you have a clear path
to being Bravo 1?

01:18.991 --> 01:20.906
You being compromised
is dangerous for everyone.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.386
You want to know
what's fuckin' dangerous? Huh?

01:22.430 --> 01:23.953
You threatening the team leader.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.434
So you better think
long and hard,

01:26.477 --> 01:28.914
'cause next time's not gonna be
a fuckin' warning.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.367
Oh, that is some kind of rotten.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.413
Smells like the ghost
of Full Metal's skivvies.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.241
Welcome back.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.243
We just spent three days
in a stakeout van.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.245
Why do we smell fresher
than the funk in here?

01:55.289 --> 01:57.421
I know you're not coming at me
with that.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.814
Guys.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.598
You know we're on
an Omega op here,

02:00.642 --> 02:01.947
which means we're on our own.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.253
You make a mess,
you got to clean it up.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.081
- You can't let it just fester.
- Mess or not,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.823
place is still
fuckin' rodent-infested.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.260
Sonny, isn't that

02:10.304 --> 02:12.610
that burger joint that you like
next to the bar?

02:12.654 --> 02:14.308
How many times you been?

02:14.351 --> 02:17.789
Not enough times to get
a Shakira action figure.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.791
I think that all the sodium
has Sonny forgetting

02:19.835 --> 02:21.967
that we're supposed to be
invisible down here.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.447
Same bar every night.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.406
Those two-for-one Cuervo shots
are gonna bring us

02:25.449 --> 02:27.234
- some unwanted attention.
- Look, if you wanted to stay safe,

02:27.277 --> 02:29.453
maybe you should have
stayed home, Cinderella.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.933
Like Jason told you,

02:30.976 --> 02:33.065
but you didn't want to listen.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.938
Jason. What happened
when I was gone?

02:35.981 --> 02:37.896
The place is trashed.
Sonny's hungover,

02:37.940 --> 02:39.855
sniping at Clay,
who seems miserable.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.162
Low-man's issues
don't concern me.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.164
You barely looked at him
in two weeks, man.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.078
You refused to do recon
with him. Why?

02:46.122 --> 02:49.343
Just because he questioned your
call on killing the scientist?

02:49.386 --> 02:51.823
Look, you got anything off your
surveillance we can move on?

02:51.867 --> 02:53.521
Hmm? Anything at all?

02:55.349 --> 02:58.178
- Yeah, the pattern-of-life held. We're good to go.
- Good.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.483
- Davis.
- Yo.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.485
Ray's got intel.
Team room in 20.

03:01.529 --> 03:05.228
Oh, yes. Fuckin' finally.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.810
Hey.

03:23.942 --> 03:27.207
With our recon shifts, I haven't
had a chance to talk to you.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.297
Thought I warned you about
what you were gonna say next,

03:30.340 --> 03:31.907
didn't I?

03:33.909 --> 03:36.912
What I said that night, uh...

03:36.955 --> 03:39.262
I'm not gunning for you.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.133
I'm trying to help you.

03:41.177 --> 03:44.702
Right, so you think my head's
so busted I forgot about that?

03:46.356 --> 03:49.490
With us... with us rolling out,
I just, I want to clear the air

03:49.533 --> 03:51.709
so there are no issues
downrange.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.581
Okay, so you shit on me,

03:53.624 --> 03:57.149
then you think it's
on both of us to light a match?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.891
Tell you what, you want things
to be good with us downrange,

03:59.935 --> 04:02.242
stay the fuck out of my way.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.173
Ephraim Zaid and Arman Soroush,

04:21.217 --> 04:24.394
the Iranian defense experts we
believe were aiding Dr. Guillen

04:24.438 --> 04:27.092
in establishing the Venezuelan
nuclear weapons program.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.573
Guillen is the brains
behind the program.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.010
- Now his brains are all over the dashboard.
- With the mastermind X'd out,

04:32.054 --> 04:33.621
we'll just sweep up
the leftovers.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.319
Well, the fact that
the Iranians stuck around

04:36.363 --> 04:38.365
after Guillen's death means
there are probably still embers

04:38.408 --> 04:40.976
- of the program we need to smother.
- Sounds like there's more

04:41.019 --> 04:42.630
to the story than Guillen.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.545
When we get our hands
on those computers,

04:44.588 --> 04:46.851
they'll tell the story.
Well, lucky for us

04:46.895 --> 04:48.462
these two are
creatures of habit.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.899
1700 every evening,
Zaid leaves his hotel

04:50.942 --> 04:52.204
for a 30-minute jog.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.163
Soroush hits the hotel bar
at the same time.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.600
Well, that gives us a window
to Watergate their rooms.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.603
Should take ten minutes
to clone their hard drives.

04:59.647 --> 05:02.084
My recon shift,
Soroush guzzles a drink

05:02.127 --> 05:03.694
and went back up to his room.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.957
He was outside
for barely two minutes.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.482
That happens again,
we're screwed.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.658
We'll have a contingency plan
in place.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.095
No. Heist like this
has got to be clockwork.

05:13.138 --> 05:16.707
I mean, any friction between
the gears, it falls apart.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.319
Everybody stays in their lane,
there won't be any friction.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.935
Yo.

05:26.978 --> 05:30.460
Hey, am I missing something
with you and Jace?

05:31.461 --> 05:34.551
- Ask him.
- I'm asking you.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.074
We got an op to run.

05:36.118 --> 05:39.034
Is this gonna blow over
or is it gonna blow up?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.999
He's not right.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.133
- He hasn't been for months.
- About what?

05:51.176 --> 05:53.048
What are you talking about, man?

05:54.441 --> 05:56.834
Jason's forgetting things.

05:57.835 --> 06:01.012
Saw it inside the wire first,
but now it's crawled outside.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.972
Could be TBI.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.497
You know,
you can get a bird pulled,

06:07.541 --> 06:09.151
you start tossing
stuff like that around.

06:09.194 --> 06:12.241
That's why I wasn't gonna say
anything down here, but...

06:12.284 --> 06:14.330
after the, uh,
after the Guillen op,

06:14.374 --> 06:15.505
it just...

06:15.549 --> 06:17.768
- it just kind of came out.
- Hold on,

06:17.812 --> 06:21.293
you dropped that on him here?
What the hell were you thinking?

06:21.337 --> 06:24.296
I didn't want to do it this way,
but Bravo's not safe

06:24.340 --> 06:26.211
if he's compromised.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.650
We are trying to stop the
next Cuban Missile Crisis here,

06:29.693 --> 06:32.696
and-and-and you would jeopardize
that mission for what, to...

06:32.740 --> 06:35.830
for your burning need to find
some chink in Jason's armor

06:35.873 --> 06:37.092
to show him up?

06:37.135 --> 06:38.659
Seriously?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.878
You really think that
I'd leave my child in the NICU

06:40.922 --> 06:43.011
- to come down here for some power grab?
- I don't know

06:43.054 --> 06:45.361
what your angle is,
but this ain't the place for it.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.058
I mean, Jason's fine.

06:53.935 --> 06:57.417
Jason brought that building down
on us in Mali, Ray.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.290
Bullshit.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.553
Command knows it was an RPG.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.870
On target, Jason and I...

07:15.913 --> 07:19.439
marked an explosives cache,
and then he forgot.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.615
He told the partner force

07:21.658 --> 07:24.531
to put a wall charge
right on that hazard.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.447
He put us all
in the hospital, Ray.

07:28.317 --> 07:31.712
Do not tell me that you threw
that allegation at him here.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.888
No, I didn't.
But it's not an allegation.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.325
- It's a fact.
- According to you.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.937
I didn't want to believe it
at first, either.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.160
Not another word.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.901
All right? To anyone.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.120
Of all the risks we face
down here,

07:49.164 --> 07:52.036
the biggest threat to Bravo
is your mouth.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.450
Burns is heading out
for his jog.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.975
Smithers is still at the bar.

08:18.019 --> 08:21.283
Security at his usual spot.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.024
Copy all. Heading upstairs.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.940
Smithers is about to get out
of here real quick.

08:25.983 --> 08:29.465
Downright disrespectful
to that 21-year-old

08:29.509 --> 08:31.554
lantern fuel.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.522
Oh.

08:42.565 --> 08:43.871
Oh. Uh, pardon me.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.829
- My apologies.
- Oh, I'm always in a rush

08:45.873 --> 08:48.615
when it's the one time of day
I can slow down.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.356
You're right. What's the hurry?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.184
What are you drinking?

08:53.228 --> 08:56.013
Surprise me.

09:00.365 --> 09:03.543
<i>2, this is 6,
Knife has Smithers at the bar.</i>

09:03.586 --> 09:05.980
<i>Rip those laptops ASAP.</i>

11:00.921 --> 11:02.966
Well, the truth is that
I'm hoping my work down here

11:03.010 --> 11:05.926
dazzles my bosses
back in the panhandle,

11:05.969 --> 11:07.579
gets me out of trouble.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.973
Oil is a dirty business.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.889
Dirty's never bothered me.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.732
Burns is back.
Looks like he's injured.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.690
How copy?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.735
Good copy. Upload in progress.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.823
Yeah, copy.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.825
Got two minutes left
on my upload.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.962
Just got another security guard
that we didn't clock.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.881
They're heading
to the elevators.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.621
<i>
Smithers' upload complete.</i>

11:49.665 --> 11:51.406
Moving to the hall.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.540
One hard drive's enough.
Get out of the room, 6.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.065
Just need another minute.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.509
Get out of the room now, 6.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.772
He'll be slow getting up here.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.692
Easy.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.128
<i>
6, get out of the room now.</i>

12:18.172 --> 12:20.348
Let me get some ice.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.831
<i>
6, you are clear.</i>

12:24.874 --> 12:27.485
<i>
6, do you copy?</i>

12:42.979 --> 12:44.938
Jackpot.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.809
Tell you what,
Keyser Soöze himself

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
couldn't have masterminded
a slicker heist.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.161
Except the DoD's gonna be able
to buy one less jet

12:51.205 --> 12:52.946
after they see Sonny's bar tab.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.426
Sober enough to keep myself
from warning the Iranian

12:55.470 --> 12:58.212
that you'll break him in two.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.475
You saved us. Ignore him.

13:02.999 --> 13:06.002
Yo. You just quarterbacked
a ninja op, man.

13:06.046 --> 13:09.049
- What's got you so down?
- Spenser went against me out there.

13:09.092 --> 13:12.313
Well, he made a judgment call.
And it worked out, I might add.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.402
His ego's gonna cost us one day.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.231
Look, Jace, don't let what's
going on between the two of you

13:17.274 --> 13:19.276
start making you spin out,
brother.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.278
It's not. It's your problem now.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.454
Keep him away from me.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.815
Davis.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.599
- Yo.
- What's the payday from the hotel?

13:37.642 --> 13:40.471
Um, still filtering through
it all, but the Iranians

13:40.515 --> 13:42.865
were definitely working
hand in hand with Guillen.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.214
They provided schematics

13:44.258 --> 13:46.869
for known
Iranian nuclear installations,

13:46.913 --> 13:48.871
serious financial backing.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.527
Not what you were hoping for

13:52.570 --> 13:54.746
after hovering around me
since dawn?

13:54.790 --> 13:56.357
You know, look,
I understand taking out Guillen

13:56.400 --> 13:57.967
was cutting off the head
of the snake.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.447
But you know what? We need ops.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.449
Copy.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.885
And I know
where to find you guys.

14:02.929 --> 14:03.886
Yup.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.498
About three inches from me
at all times.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.764
<i>STELLA</i> <i>
Hi, baby.</i>

14:12.808 --> 14:14.114
<i>Look at that.</i>

14:14.157 --> 14:15.985
<i>Where's that creeper van</i> <i>
parked now?</i>

14:16.029 --> 14:18.553
<i>If you say playground,</i> <i>
I'm gonna... I'm gonna worry.</i>

14:19.946 --> 14:21.338
The coffee shop.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.558
Mm, hopping
between random public Wi-Fi's

14:23.601 --> 14:24.907
helps hide our footprint.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.822
But it's definitely getting old.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.911
How are you? How's he?

14:28.955 --> 14:30.217
<i>We're both good.</i>

14:30.260 --> 14:31.827
<i>Here, you wanna see?</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:33.307
<i>Here.</i>

14:34.090 --> 14:35.918
He looks bigger.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.529
<i>Yeah, he's</i> <i>
just under three pounds.</i>

14:39.313 --> 14:42.229
Any more scares
with that apnea monitor?

14:43.099 --> 14:44.927
<i>His breathing's been good.</i>

14:44.971 --> 14:47.799
What about the heart thing
they were checking for?

14:47.843 --> 14:50.063
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

14:51.542 --> 14:54.458
I feel like there's something
you're afraid to tell me.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.633
<i>No.</i>

14:55.677 --> 14:56.808
<i>No, everything's fine.</i>

14:56.852 --> 14:58.593
<i>How-How's, um, how's the team?</i>

14:58.636 --> 14:59.768
<i>Is everyone safe?</i>

14:59.811 --> 15:01.770
Not because of anything
that I've done.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.338
 <i>
I thought being</i> <i>
Bravo's guardian angel</i>

15:04.381 --> 15:06.601
<i>was the whole point</i> <i>
of you going down there.</i>

15:06.644 --> 15:11.258
"Guardian angel"
is close to being cast out.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.477
<i>What do you mean?</i>

15:16.741 --> 15:18.787
Can I see him again?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.441
<i>Of course, baby. Here.</i>

15:21.181 --> 15:23.400
<i>Say hi to Daddy.</i>

15:24.184 --> 15:26.186
Hi.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.274
Oh.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.885
Who's the target?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.539
Clawed up
from the corners of hell

15:31.582 --> 15:34.281
where pumpkin spice
and Priuses spawn.

15:34.324 --> 15:38.024
Devourer of all hopes and dreams.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.157
- His name is Todd.
- Todd the Wet Sprocket.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
Mm-hmm.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.334
So, uh...

15:44.378 --> 15:47.207
you didn't go with Clay and Ray
in the phone-home van?

15:47.250 --> 15:50.210
- No.
- Nah, me either.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.994
You probably heard already

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
about my deal back home
going south?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.302
Literally.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.434
You know, shit happens, right?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
Yeah.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.137
I just thought with...

16:04.180 --> 16:08.445
the way Hannah clacked off
with our whole situation,

16:08.489 --> 16:12.928
you know, it was like getting
hit with a Mosul speed bump.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.843
Oh.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.498
Thought we had it good.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.327
This job will set you straight
every time, you know that.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.460
- I guess so.
- Can't keep looking back.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.332
You're gonna end up
with a kinked neck.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.856
You just stay
in your three-foot world.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.119
Got a lot of work coming up.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.035
We crank the op tempo,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.081
Omega's gonna be
the perfect way to work.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.734
Damn straight.
Do things our way.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.519
That's right.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.087
No Command,

16:41.130 --> 16:43.176
no distractions.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.529
That's about as good as it gets.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.533
<i>
Why didn't you tell me</i>

16:52.576 --> 16:54.578
<i>Hannah and Leanne moved back</i> <i>
to Texas?</i>

16:54.622 --> 16:56.711
<i>I called her the other day</i> <i>
to see if she needed a hand.</i>

16:56.754 --> 17:00.802
Well, hey, I-I didn't find out
until after I got here.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.109
<i>How's Sonny dealing with it?</i>

17:03.152 --> 17:04.893
In typical Sonny fashion.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.506
<i>Is Jason keeping him in line?</i>

17:09.550 --> 17:12.074
He's too busy shadowboxing
with Clay to do that.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
I am doing everything I can

17:14.120 --> 17:16.296
to keep them
from actually throwing punches.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.995
<i>Sounds like Bravo 2 is back</i> <i>
in his comfort zone.</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:21.388
What does that mean?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.303
<i>Just with Jason turning to Clay</i> <i>
more often,</i>

17:23.346 --> 17:26.349
<i>and, you know, thinking someone</i> <i>
on the team betrayed you,</i>

17:26.393 --> 17:29.091
<i>had you feeling like</i> <i>
you weren't helping Bravo.</i>

17:29.135 --> 17:30.832
<i>And now here you are,</i>

17:30.875 --> 17:33.791
<i>back as team den mother.</i>

17:34.662 --> 17:37.012
Well, yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.622
<i>With, uh, such a full plate,</i>

17:38.666 --> 17:41.408
<i>I'm guessing
you haven't given much thought</i>

17:41.451 --> 17:43.540
<i>- to our side project?</i>
- No, babe.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.587
I... I know vets like Sam
need help.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.197
I'm just...

17:48.241 --> 17:50.634
I'm not sure
I'm the one to do it.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.767
<i>Given how much Bravo needs you,</i>

17:52.810 --> 17:56.075
<i>maybe you don't have</i> <i>
the help to give.</i>

17:58.294 --> 18:00.731
Brock, just follow the system.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.777
It truly is not that hard.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.039
Hey, we poached

18:04.083 --> 18:05.954
our Wi-Fi
from that café that you like.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.347
Here you go.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.218
Thank you.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.176
Yeah.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.612
Oh, my God.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.570
You know, it's bad enough
that Sonny won't help,

18:13.614 --> 18:15.790
but his choice
of anger management

18:15.833 --> 18:17.400
is like nails on a chalkboard.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.840
What, uh, are you and Clark Gable doing over here?

18:22.884 --> 18:24.842
Brock is helping me input
the data

18:24.886 --> 18:26.409
from the Iranians' computers.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.759
We're skimming emails,
looking for anything relevant

18:28.803 --> 18:31.284
to the Venezuelan
nuclear program.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.634
You want an extra set of eyes?

18:34.765 --> 18:35.897
Yeah. Great.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.333
Um...

18:37.377 --> 18:39.901
uh, anything probative goes
in the red folder.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.946
Anything questionable goes
in yellow.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.992
Green is...

18:44.035 --> 18:47.735
Uh, Brock, where did the probative folder go?

18:47.778 --> 18:49.345
I didn't touch it.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.043
You did. It says
that your user name moved it.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.176
Sorry.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.005
I guess I could have used
a coffee, too, Clay.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.096
Oh...

19:01.966 --> 19:04.839
Ace, two, three,

19:04.882 --> 19:08.451
four, five, six.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.933
Ace, seven, three,
king, jack, six.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.978
Ace, seven,

19:14.022 --> 19:15.937
three, king.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.550
Fuck.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.771
Jack, king, ace, seven, three.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.686
King, jack...

19:25.729 --> 19:27.078
Hey.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.168
- Did you find something?
- Yeah. Look at this.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.213
Um, email the Iranians received
two days ago

19:31.257 --> 19:34.956
saying members of a <i>Colectivo</i>
in Zulia are sick.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.697
<i>Colectivo?</i>

19:36.740 --> 19:39.526
Yeah. Armed biker gangs
the state deputizes

19:39.569 --> 19:41.789
as enforcers in certain areas
of Venezuela.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.139
Yeah, the email says
three members got sick,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.706
lost their hair,
blisters on their skin,

19:45.749 --> 19:50.406
and then died after helping
with "the project."

19:50.450 --> 19:52.191
This could be
radiation sickness.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.367
Yeah, but, I mean, those
symptoms could be from anything.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.456
Then why were the Iranians
being notified?

19:56.499 --> 19:58.197
This <i>Colectivo</i> was hired help.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.763
They could have been
transporting something

19:59.807 --> 20:02.070
that was radioactive,
or protecting it, or...

20:02.113 --> 20:05.856
Intel says the Venezuelans'
nuke program is in its infancy.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.556
Lot of steps before
radioactive material's involved.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.297
Unless the intel's wrong.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.125
What if this program wasn't
just in Dr. Guillen's head.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.693
What if it's
already being brought to life?

20:27.487 --> 20:28.792
Yo.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.620
Gonna go grab food.
I found an empanada place

20:30.664 --> 20:32.622
- that'll make you weep. You in?
- I'm good.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.668
Come on, man, you've been
hunkered down here all week.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.887
It's work, Ray.
It's not a vacation.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.150
Well, you want to grab the van,
call Emma and Mikey?

20:39.194 --> 20:40.848
I'm sure they'll be happy
to hear your voice.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.806
My kids don't want to talk to
me, especially Emma right now.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.026
Well, what happened? I thought
you guys were tighter than ever.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.593
Don't worry about it, okay?

20:46.636 --> 20:49.073
What about calling Mandy?
You want to call her?

20:50.205 --> 20:52.816
Me and Mandy are done.
It's over, okay?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.296
What's with all these questions?

20:54.340 --> 20:55.515
You know what's up.

20:55.558 --> 20:56.994
I'm just making sure
you're good.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.474
Spenser get to you?

20:58.518 --> 21:00.433
No. But it's obvious
he's not the only one

21:00.476 --> 21:02.261
- you're putting walls up against.
- I'm just focused on the work,

21:02.304 --> 21:04.393
- Ray, that's it.
- Oh, not too long ago it seemed like you were

21:04.437 --> 21:06.569
on the brink of something
beyond the work. What happened?

21:06.613 --> 21:08.441
You know what,
you want a project, talk to her.

21:08.484 --> 21:11.182
Hey. I got some intel
you need to hear about.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.668
Ooh, search...

21:21.976 --> 21:24.544
Ooh. Take that. You like that?

21:24.587 --> 21:26.285
Do you like that?

21:26.328 --> 21:29.549
You like that.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.472
That's that one that you and I
lost way too much sleep to

21:39.515 --> 21:42.475
on our first, uh,
first deployment in JBAD.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.434
- Huh.
- Hey, is my, uh, is my character still saved?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.262
- Let's bust him out.
- Yeah, right.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.133
Your guy died of neglect.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.179
Chewed his own arm off
while you were obsessed

21:51.222 --> 21:53.834
with that weird chick from D.C.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.925
Look, man, I know that
you're all torn up about Leanne,

21:57.968 --> 21:59.318
but...

21:59.361 --> 22:01.320
a deployment's
normally your happy place.

22:01.363 --> 22:05.019
- At least the ones on dry land.
- It's the only happy place I got left.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.151
Okay? That's
why it sucks that you...

22:07.195 --> 22:09.371
you've gone ahead
and ruined it this time.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.200
Well, how did I do that?

22:12.243 --> 22:13.767
You were questioning
Jason's calls,

22:13.810 --> 22:15.290
running around playing Bravo 1.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.901
You have pissed him off.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.860
It's got nothing to do with you.

22:19.903 --> 22:22.036
When you piss
the team leader off,

22:22.079 --> 22:24.430
it ruins the vibe for everyone.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.954
You, Spenser,

22:26.997 --> 22:28.564
have ruined the vibe
for everyone.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.697
Well, I didn't realize that
Bravo 6 had that much power.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.481
He gave you an opportunity
to ride shotgun,

22:32.525 --> 22:34.527
and you went ahead
and damn grabbed the wheel.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.312
You'd rather have us
drive off a cliff?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.922
Hey, guys.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.185
We got action on the line.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.453
So far, we've operated down here

22:47.496 --> 22:49.368
strictly from the shadows--
ghosts.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.588
So it's only appropriate our
target tonight is a cemetery.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.373
I told you,
I was telling you guys

22:54.416 --> 22:56.418
about the zombie apocalypse.
Oh, not far off.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.594
Mission objective
is retrieving a body.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.031
Village of Archero
in rural Zulia,

23:01.075 --> 23:02.772
home to
the <i>Monte Sacro Colectivo,</i>

23:02.816 --> 23:04.383
a gang of approximately 30 men

23:04.426 --> 23:06.602
who serve as the regime's muscle
in the area.

23:06.646 --> 23:07.995
We believe three of them
recently died

23:08.038 --> 23:09.431
from radiation exposure.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.041
How in the hell
did they get Chernobyl'd

23:11.085 --> 23:12.869
in the jungle?
I'm guessing

23:12.913 --> 23:14.436
that's what the body
will help answer.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.438
Yeah, it'll be sent
to a lab stateside,

23:16.482 --> 23:18.484
and the tissue analysis
should help us determine

23:18.527 --> 23:20.311
the nature
of the radioactive exposure.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.096
Giving us a read
on what glowing green death

23:22.139 --> 23:23.837
the Venezuelans
may have gotten their hands on.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.535
Biometrics on the deceased will
also provide me I.D. I can use

23:26.579 --> 23:28.755
to track their movements
over the past few weeks,

23:28.798 --> 23:30.583
see where and when
they may have come in contact

23:30.626 --> 23:33.020
with the material.
But first, we rob a grave.

23:33.063 --> 23:36.632
Mm-hmm. And the cemetery is
in the center of the village,

23:36.676 --> 23:38.417
and our mandate...

23:38.460 --> 23:42.203
to execute with zero footprint
still stands.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.248
We're outnumbered
by three dozen <i>vatos locos,</i>

23:44.292 --> 23:47.164
and we can't fire
one single shot?

23:47.208 --> 23:49.297
Things go sideways,
our cover could get blown.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.733
The <i>Colectivo</i> have plenty
of enemies in the area--

23:50.777 --> 23:53.519
cartel, gangs--
so if it comes down to engaging,

23:53.562 --> 23:55.695
you could be any
of those rival forces.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.480
So break out the black masks.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.916
Bad guy Bravo,

23:59.960 --> 24:01.483
best kind of Bravo.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.312
Passing ourselves off as locals
doesn't even the numbers.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.619
I mean, we still need to take
every measure to avoid contact.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.490
Okay, sure, but flying blind
into a hornets' nest?

24:08.534 --> 24:10.579
I will not hesitate
to protect us.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.064
Okay, so let's take ten minutes,

24:17.107 --> 24:19.806
then get into the op plan,
all right?

24:30.512 --> 24:31.948
Yo.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.125
You're not crazy.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.606
I'm seeing things in Jason
that's got me worried, too.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.479
Especially on the brink
of this op.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.962
Do you think he takes a caution
flag any better coming from you?

24:46.006 --> 24:47.964
It's clear to me he
already knows he has a problem.

24:48.008 --> 24:51.838
He-he doesn't know that
he put Bravo in the hospital.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.405
I mean, I can't imagine he'd
be kitting up if he knew that.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.624
Agreed.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.626
But if I lay that on him
and he folds,

24:57.670 --> 24:59.628
where does that leave Bravo
and this mission?

24:59.672 --> 25:00.977
Not to mention Jason's career

25:01.021 --> 25:03.545
once Command asks
how it all imploded.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.504
I don't know.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.984
Fact that
I didn't notice anything,

25:08.028 --> 25:10.900
it means he's good
99% of the time, right?

25:10.944 --> 25:14.513
Yeah, but that one percent's
enough to get us all killed.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.992
Almost did.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.865
So that's what you and I
are gonna protect against.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.171
All right?
We keep an eye on him

25:21.215 --> 25:23.086
at all times.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.436
Any chance to put up guardrails,
we do it.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.003
Minimize operational hazards.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.832
We... we swim-buddy Bravo 1
at every point.

25:29.876 --> 25:33.619
We keep it covert
between you and me.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.664
You know if he catches on,
this is gonna be

25:35.708 --> 25:37.623
an even greater betrayal
coming from you.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.015
Yeah, it's a risk.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.540
But doing nothing's
a bigger risk, so...

25:41.583 --> 25:43.237
you in or not?

25:44.064 --> 25:46.936
It's the only reason
I'm down here.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.244
All right.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.563
I have to say, I'm used
to planting dead scumbags,

26:04.606 --> 26:06.042
but harvesting them?

26:06.086 --> 26:08.741
How's this, uh,
Operation Igor plan gonna work?

26:08.784 --> 26:11.961
These Langley lab geeks
really need a whole corpse?

26:12.005 --> 26:13.876
Certain radioisotopes gather
in different tissues,

26:13.920 --> 26:15.878
so the whole body is ideal.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.271
Also, you'll need to get
biometrics

26:17.314 --> 26:20.143
from all three deceased
if you can, but...

26:20.187 --> 26:22.493
retrieve the one who appears
to have the worst symptoms.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.583
Omega work is not
for the faint of heart.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.585
When you approach the cemetery,

26:26.628 --> 26:28.543
you need to keep a watch
on your Geiger counters.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.762
Over a hundred clicks per minute

26:29.805 --> 26:31.328
means the bodies
could be contaminated

26:31.372 --> 26:32.939
with radioactive particles--

26:32.982 --> 26:35.028
you'll need to take
extra precautions.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.639
- We wearing hazmat suits for this?
- Not unless the Geigers go off.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.510
Okay? The suits
are just gonna slow us down.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.861
The body bag will be lined with
lead to contain the radiation.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.471
Cemetery's here, all right?

26:43.514 --> 26:45.734
Foot patrol in. Two fire teams
sweep straight through,

26:45.778 --> 26:47.910
find the graves,
bag the body and we go.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.956
That's it.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.741
I mean, Jace,
with the lack of intel

26:52.785 --> 26:54.264
we have on the village, I mean,

26:54.308 --> 26:56.440
we might want
to slow things down, right?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.834
Uh, get a backpack drone
in the air,

26:58.878 --> 27:00.444
clear through the target
with set phase lines, yeah?

27:00.488 --> 27:02.621
That's gonna slow us down.
We got to move fast, okay?

27:02.664 --> 27:04.274
Violence of action
if we hit any resistance.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.189
I'm all for speed,
but, I mean, that dead weight

27:06.233 --> 27:08.191
we're gonna be lugging
is gonna slow us down.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.106
Taking a beat to know
what's around each corner

27:10.150 --> 27:12.195
is not gonna hurt-- I mean,
the enemy is not sophisticated,

27:12.239 --> 27:14.154
but they are merciless.

27:14.197 --> 27:18.462
Fine. Davis, stay with the
vehicle, watch the drone feed.

27:18.506 --> 27:21.640
You two, you enter from here.
Brock, Sonny, you're with me.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.903
- We enter from there. Got it?
- You sure you don't want a sniper

27:23.946 --> 27:26.775
on each team just in case? I mean, I could swap with Brock,

27:26.819 --> 27:28.734
- hop on your team.
- Okay, fine. Just do it.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.345
Jock up in 30. Let's move.

27:32.607 --> 27:36.350
Any issues come up, channel four
will be our private line, yeah?

27:36.393 --> 27:38.178
Roger that.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.814
Knife, this is Team 1.

28:05.858 --> 28:08.730
Hit phase line Green.
Launching the drone now.

28:22.875 --> 28:23.876
Copy.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.704
I have eyes.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.990
Lot of government plates.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.862
Might be what transports
the hired hands

28:53.906 --> 28:56.038
to wherever they got sick.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.388
We rip the GPS
to get their location.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.695
Smart. But let's stay on task.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.871
Do it on the way out.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.922
Look at that.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.117
They're not gonna bury
the bodies.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.075
They're gonna burn them.

29:33.119 --> 29:37.079
Live like biker pirates,
go out like Vikings.

29:37.123 --> 29:40.082
I wonder if they're accepting
applications.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.998
If it's a funeral,
we need to act

29:43.042 --> 29:44.783
before the crowd
starts gathering.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.610
I'll take the guy on the left.
On me.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.354
Team 2, this is Team 1.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.878
Consolidate on me.

30:09.938 --> 30:12.114
How's the counter?

30:12.158 --> 30:13.986
Barely chirping.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.907
Winner winner chicken dinner.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.127
No need for shovels.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.781
Brock, set security.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.131
- Clay, get biometrics.
- After the body's bagged,

30:29.175 --> 30:30.959
meet up
at the primary rally point.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.179
- Sonny, on me.
- Wait, what are...

30:33.222 --> 30:34.789
Jace? Jace?

30:36.356 --> 30:38.227
Just lost our swim buddy.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.116
It shouldn't take long
to pull the GPS.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.480
The hell would Jason go?

31:13.523 --> 31:15.743
Saw something on the way in.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.226
1, this is 2.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.054
What's your status?

31:26.101 --> 31:27.668
1, this is 2.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.452
Radio check. Over.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.719
Double-clicked you.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.983
Still doesn't mean
he's not in trouble.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.819
Knife, this is 2.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.909
Can you shift drone position?

31:50.952 --> 31:53.215
<i>
Take it 100 meters north.</i>

31:55.174 --> 31:59.134
Copy. Shifting drone
100 meters north.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.539
<i>2, this is 1.</i>

32:12.582 --> 32:13.801
What the hell
are you looking for?

32:15.411 --> 32:17.631
Good copy, 1.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.633
Just checking to see
if there was any movement

32:19.676 --> 32:21.156
toward our exfil route.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.942
Let's move.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.612
Aw, Jesus.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.137
Sorry, I didn't even see them,
Jason.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.097
2, this is 1.
I got two enemy down hard.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.666
<i>More enemy in the area.</i> <i>
We're holding here.</i>

32:53.493 --> 32:55.277
Copy, 1.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.975
We'll redirect to your position.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.916
Told you we'd hit these trucks
on the way out.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.918
I didn't think
we'd have enough time.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.746
I got the GPS data.
Let's move to exfil.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.314
<i>
1, be advised,</i> <i>
there are at least 30 locals</i>

33:32.358 --> 33:33.620
<i>moving through the village,</i>

33:33.663 --> 33:35.839
all headed toward the bonfire.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.061
Son of a bitch.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.082
Looks like they're all
getting together

34:01.126 --> 34:03.041
to say goodbye
to their brothers.

34:03.084 --> 34:07.175
How long till they find those
two guys we dropped by the fire?

34:09.221 --> 34:10.526
Think they just did.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.963
Funeral's about to become
a hunting party.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.717
Knife, this is 1. I need an
exfil route through the swarm.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.763
Copy, 1. I'm searching.
These guys are pouring out

34:29.806 --> 34:31.199
from every building in town.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.896
Hold what you got.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.376
If we're gonna be scrambling
out of here,

34:34.420 --> 34:36.030
the body's gonna weigh us down.
We gotta leave it.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.945
The body is the mission.
We're not leaving it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.558
We're fixin' to be
about a half ton

34:42.602 --> 34:44.038
of frog meat on that fire.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.214
Knife, this is 1.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.129
Need that exfil route.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.697
Copy. I found a clear path
if you can move quick.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.743
Head west for 50 meters,
you'll hit a wall. Climb it,

34:53.787 --> 34:55.397
<i>cross the yard, you'll be out.</i>

34:55.441 --> 34:56.442
Copy that. Moving.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.791
Let's go.

35:01.882 --> 35:04.102
How we climbing a wall
with that?

35:27.168 --> 35:28.778
That piece big enough?

35:28.822 --> 35:31.390
Put it in your bag, all right?
Let's move.

36:57.389 --> 36:58.912
Mm.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.870
We are gonna run out
of hot water

37:00.914 --> 37:02.742
with everyone taking
Silkwood showers.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.007
Yeah, well,
I had to scrub my mind clear

37:07.050 --> 37:09.009
after watching you hack
that leg off.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.402
Yeah.

37:10.445 --> 37:13.013
Yeah, it's such a...
a damn shame

37:13.056 --> 37:15.058
that we had to send it away.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.931
Tell you what...

37:17.974 --> 37:20.063
it would have made
one hell of a souvenir

37:20.107 --> 37:21.848
for the team room.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.244
Oh...

37:26.287 --> 37:29.116
I think I'm gonna take the van
and try and call home.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.075
Middle of the night, but...

37:32.119 --> 37:34.252
maybe be good for you
to see Leanne.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.515
I'm sure Hannah
would understand.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.865
Yeah, if you want to see
my stomach turn,

37:38.908 --> 37:42.303
just have me talk to that woman.

37:42.347 --> 37:45.524
And seeing my kid through
some shitty little screen,

37:45.567 --> 37:46.742
well...

37:46.786 --> 37:49.267
that does nothing for me.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.360
Whew.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.408
Hey.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.891
Comment you made

38:04.934 --> 38:07.937
about warning the Iranian
that I'd break him in two...

38:07.981 --> 38:09.939
kind of a cheap shot.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.637
History can be cruel.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.466
Okay, well, just lay off
a little, all right?

38:14.509 --> 38:16.729
I'm under a lot of pressure
down here.

38:16.772 --> 38:19.035
Kind of shot myself in the foot
with Command

38:19.079 --> 38:20.646
over this Fellowship thing,
so...

38:20.689 --> 38:23.213
I'm trying to redeem myself.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.347
Good luck with that.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
Sonny. Hey.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.309
I'm-I'm sorry
about Leanne and Hannah.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.010
You should be.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.316
Excuse me?

38:38.359 --> 38:40.709
You're part of the reason
that Hannah left.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.277
Making her feel like there
was still something between us

38:43.321 --> 38:44.670
that night at the Bulkhead.

38:44.713 --> 38:45.845
That...

38:45.888 --> 38:47.629
I didn't do anything.

38:47.673 --> 38:48.935
Oh, you didn't do anything?

38:48.978 --> 38:50.632
- No, I didn't do anything.
- Okay.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.939
You keep telling yourself that,
Ms. Davis.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.941
No, Sonny,
I know you well enough

38:54.984 --> 38:56.638
to know
that's not why it happened.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.727
And if you're flailing around
looking for somebody to blame,

38:58.771 --> 39:01.339
why don't you check
the fucking mirror for once.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.651
<i>STELLA</i> <i>
Hey.</i>

39:09.695 --> 39:11.697
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

39:11.740 --> 39:13.002
Yeah.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.962
Um, I'm sorry it's so late.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.485
<i>It's fine, it's fine.</i>

39:17.529 --> 39:20.227
<i>I thought you only get to call</i> <i>
once a week.</i>

39:20.270 --> 39:23.404
That's supposed to be
the rule, but...

39:23.448 --> 39:27.756
nothing's how it's supposed
to be down here.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.845
<i>What's wrong?</i>

39:32.848 --> 39:34.415
I-I just...

39:34.459 --> 39:37.026
I sense that there
was something that...

39:37.070 --> 39:39.855
you were holding back earlier.

39:40.726 --> 39:43.381
Like, scared to tell me, maybe.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.907
But, like, the way...

39:47.950 --> 39:51.040
things have been down here,
I just...

39:52.346 --> 39:56.002
...I don't want another secret
hanging over me.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.484
I need to know, please.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.402
<i>There was something.</i>

40:07.274 --> 40:09.624
 <i>
I got to hold him.</i>

40:13.976 --> 40:16.544
- You got... <i>
- His lungs are</i> <i>finally strong enough</i>

40:16.588 --> 40:19.852
<i>to come off the oxygen, so they</i> <i>
let... they let me hold him.</i>

40:20.679 --> 40:23.986
<i>It was just for an hour,</i> <i>
but it was... it was...</i>

40:24.030 --> 40:26.162
- Amazing. <i>
- Yeah.</i>

40:26.206 --> 40:28.513
<i>And I'm so sorry</i> <i>
that I didn't tell you.</i>

40:28.556 --> 40:31.559
<i>I just didn't want you to feel</i> <i>
like you were missing out.</i>

40:33.082 --> 40:35.476
I am missing out.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.089
Because of my own choice.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.925
Tell me more.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.884
 <i>
He held my finger.</i>

40:51.927 --> 40:54.713
<i>I mean, he just grabbed on</i> <i>
with his little tiny hand,</i>

40:54.756 --> 40:56.628
<i>and he would not let go.</i>

40:58.238 --> 41:01.415
<i>He's just so strong.</i>

41:01.459 --> 41:03.635
<i>Just like his daddy.</i>

41:11.599 --> 41:13.645
I should have been there.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.481
Oof. Tell you what.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.308
Sunlight'll be a welcome change
after that op.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.093
Got pretty bleak out there, huh?

41:27.136 --> 41:29.095
Wasn't worried, Ray.
Obviously you were.

41:29.138 --> 41:32.272
That stunt you pulled
with the drone?

41:32.315 --> 41:34.579
You're supposed
to have my back, but...

41:34.622 --> 41:37.059
not, uh...

41:37.103 --> 41:39.192
be over my shoulder watching me.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.586
You ran off

41:41.629 --> 41:43.544
with Sonny in a village full
of killers, Jace.

41:43.588 --> 41:46.155
And you didn't answer my call
on comms.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.070
I double-clicked
the radio twice.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.682
Usually, that works.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.336
So why didn't it this time?

41:54.816 --> 41:56.688
After that talk, man, I...

41:56.731 --> 41:58.864
just wanted to make sure
I hadn't thrown you off.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.475
You don't have to worry
about me.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.956
I've been doing it
for over a decade now.

42:03.999 --> 42:07.002
I'm too old to find a new hobby.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.268
Davis, you get anything
off the GPS units?

42:12.312 --> 42:14.270
Yeah. It shows the trucks made
repeated stops

42:14.314 --> 42:17.578
into an industrial area
in northeast Maracaibo,

42:17.622 --> 42:21.190
but every time they enter
this 15-mile radius,

42:21.234 --> 42:22.888
the tracking cuts out.

42:22.931 --> 42:25.194
Almost like some kind
of deliberate interference.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.762
I'm not sure.
The Agency techs might be able

42:27.806 --> 42:30.765
to extract data from the units
that I can't access.

42:30.809 --> 42:33.072
Hopefully come back
with a more specific location.

42:33.115 --> 42:36.554
Location?
What do you mean? For what?

42:36.597 --> 42:40.470
Well, I mean, we won't know
until the lab studies the body.

42:40.514 --> 42:42.777
But... you saw those men.

42:42.821 --> 42:44.692
Whatever did that to them,

42:44.736 --> 42:47.913
it wasn't equations
and aspirations.

42:47.956 --> 42:49.305
Right.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.656
You think this,
uh, nuclear program

42:51.699 --> 42:54.876
- is already up and running?
- I think there's more at stake

42:54.920 --> 42:57.575
down here
than any of us imagined.

43:08.542 --> 43:10.762
Oh.

43:10.805 --> 43:12.677
Where you sneaking in from?

43:13.547 --> 43:15.505
Had to check in with Stella.

43:15.549 --> 43:17.638
- Clay...
- I know the rules.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.901
I also know
we're making them up as we go.

43:19.945 --> 43:22.600
Yes, we are.

43:23.426 --> 43:26.125
- How do you think it went out there?
- Oh...

43:26.168 --> 43:29.476
I know he did not like
that drone over his shoulder,

43:29.519 --> 43:31.130
tell you that.

43:31.957 --> 43:34.263
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
I talked him down.

43:34.307 --> 43:36.526
We've got to be slicker about it
next time.

43:36.570 --> 43:39.355
This how we're gonna operate
the rest of the trip?

43:42.141 --> 43:44.056
Doesn't feel good
going behind his back,

43:44.099 --> 43:47.015
but I don't see we have any
other option for protecting it.

43:52.455 --> 43:55.241
It just sucks
being in this position, man.

43:55.284 --> 43:57.330
I mean, he was pissed.
