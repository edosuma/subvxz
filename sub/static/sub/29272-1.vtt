01:49.332 --> 01:50.832
Hey, Ashley.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.901
Hey, Uncle Jack.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.568
Everything okay?

01:54.570 --> 01:56.570
Uh... yeah.

01:56.572 --> 01:59.073
I mean, it would be,

01:59.075 --> 02:01.609
but, um, my mom dropped me off
at the movies

02:01.611 --> 02:02.877
before she went to work,

02:02.879 --> 02:04.880
and my dad was supposed
to pick me up,

02:04.882 --> 02:05.981
but he didn't.

02:05.983 --> 02:07.782
So then I tried to take the bus,

02:07.784 --> 02:09.750
but I don't have my bus pass.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.686
And, of course,
neither one of them

02:11.688 --> 02:13.954
- are answering their phones.
- All right.

02:13.956 --> 02:15.560
I'm on my way.

02:22.665 --> 02:24.936
So, how was the movie?
Was it good?

02:26.502 --> 02:28.370
It was okay.

02:28.372 --> 02:30.339
Just okay?

02:30.341 --> 02:32.673
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it about?

02:32.675 --> 02:34.342
Zombies.

02:39.015 --> 02:40.681
By the way,

02:40.683 --> 02:42.550
sorry for interrupting
your work.

02:42.552 --> 02:44.352
You don't have to apologize.

02:44.354 --> 02:47.522
I got you that phone so you can
call me if you ever need me.

02:47.524 --> 02:49.294
I'm glad you called.

03:04.775 --> 03:06.708
Pass the Pen?

03:06.710 --> 03:08.445
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

03:09.545 --> 03:11.012
All right.

03:11.014 --> 03:12.580
- It's a good foundation.
- Yes.

03:12.582 --> 03:13.982
- I'm gonna build on it.
- Yeah.

03:13.984 --> 03:15.149
- You ready?
- Yes.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.485
- Pow. What?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

03:17.487 --> 03:18.686
With the legs.

03:18.688 --> 03:20.657
- Mm-hmm.
- Arms. Eyes.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.491
What's that?

03:23.493 --> 03:24.859
That's a smile.

03:24.861 --> 03:26.428
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah, I don't know

03:26.430 --> 03:27.963
if you're gonna be able
to match that.

03:27.965 --> 03:29.697
Let's see what you got.

03:29.699 --> 03:32.066
Hmm.

03:32.068 --> 03:33.667
- What's that?
- A wing.

03:33.669 --> 03:35.737
- Aw, it's the wings.
- Yeah.

03:35.739 --> 03:37.972
Butterfly wings.

03:40.978 --> 03:42.877
Finish it off, Picasso.

03:42.879 --> 03:44.679
I'm-a give it to you,
that's pretty good.

03:44.681 --> 03:46.680
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

03:46.682 --> 03:48.183
Can you improve on perfection?

03:48.185 --> 03:51.185
- I mean, I don't know.
- Yeah, I mean...

03:51.187 --> 03:53.187
We could do one more thing,
though.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.555
What?

03:54.557 --> 03:55.791
How about that?

03:55.793 --> 03:57.792
- Pow. Finishing touch.
- Boom.

03:57.794 --> 03:59.794
Mm-hmm.

04:02.866 --> 04:04.166
You know, the best thing

04:04.168 --> 04:06.034
about your dad
being such a screwup

04:06.036 --> 04:09.770
is I get to spend time
with my favorite niece.

04:09.772 --> 04:10.871
He's such an asshole.

04:10.873 --> 04:12.707
Ashley.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.842
Where is he, anyway?

04:21.517 --> 04:23.453
He's not so bad.

04:36.466 --> 04:38.033
Hey, Ash.

04:38.035 --> 04:39.868
- What's up?
- Nothing much.

04:39.870 --> 04:42.704
I just wanted to call
to thank you.

04:42.706 --> 04:44.072
What for?

04:44.074 --> 04:46.640
Whatever you said to my parents
the other night.

04:46.642 --> 04:48.776
Whatever you said,
I mean, it really worked.

04:48.778 --> 04:52.046
I know they were just
kissing my butt, but...

04:52.048 --> 04:54.548
And my dad bought me
this really awesome bike

04:54.550 --> 04:57.485
that I've been begging for
for, like, 15 years.

04:57.487 --> 04:59.921
Then they took me to Stefano's

04:59.923 --> 05:01.122
for a makeup dinner, of course.

05:01.124 --> 05:03.091
And, believe it or not,

05:03.093 --> 05:06.527
I finally ordered
the garlic chicken dish thing.

05:06.529 --> 05:10.066
Uh...
garlic ch-chicken dish thing?

05:11.168 --> 05:12.968
Yeah. I mean, every time we go,

05:12.970 --> 05:14.902
you try to convince me
to get it,

05:14.904 --> 05:18.772
so I decided to get it
in your honor.

05:18.774 --> 05:22.543
Delicious but really garlicky.

05:22.545 --> 05:24.546
Anyway, uh...

05:24.548 --> 05:27.014
I know I was cursing about him
the other night,

05:27.016 --> 05:29.651
so I just wanted to let you know

05:29.653 --> 05:32.586
I think he's maybe doing

05:32.588 --> 05:34.221
pretty good now.

05:34.223 --> 05:37.158
Uh... Look, I'm sorry.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.127
I'm-I'm staring
at a pile of paper

05:39.129 --> 05:41.195
I've got to get through
for my next shift.

05:41.197 --> 05:42.897
Uh...

05:42.899 --> 05:45.800
- What were you trying to say?
- It's okay.

05:45.802 --> 05:47.935
Work if you have to work.

05:47.937 --> 05:49.137
- We'll talk about things later.
- A'ight.

05:49.139 --> 05:51.074
- Bye, Uncle Jack.
- Bye.

06:05.055 --> 06:06.990
Hey, Ash.

06:08.257 --> 06:09.791
Hello?

06:09.793 --> 06:11.159
Hello. Uncle Jack.

06:11.161 --> 06:12.327
Hello? Hello. Are you...

06:12.329 --> 06:14.029
Ashley.

06:14.031 --> 06:16.831
- Can you hear me or not?
- Yeah.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.536
Ashley?

06:19.636 --> 06:20.969
A...

06:28.077 --> 06:31.079
Hey, you've reached Ashley.

06:31.081 --> 06:33.615
Please leave a message.

06:33.617 --> 06:35.916
Hey, uh, Ashley.

06:35.918 --> 06:38.820
Uh, are you okay?

06:38.822 --> 06:41.089
Uh, c-call me back.

07:15.024 --> 07:17.925
Hello?

07:17.927 --> 07:19.863
Anybody home?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.012
Ashley?

09:02.899 --> 09:04.100
Garret.

09:05.201 --> 09:07.267
Garret, get up.

09:07.269 --> 09:09.470
Garret, Garret.

09:09.472 --> 09:11.174
Come on.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.776
Garret. No, God.

09:14.778 --> 09:16.478
Oh, God.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.412
Oh, God.

09:20.182 --> 09:22.318
Somebody... Okay.

09:23.919 --> 09:25.855
Oh, God!

09:27.524 --> 09:29.290
Oh, God, Garret, what'd you do?

09:29.292 --> 09:31.092
What did you do?
What did you do?

09:32.394 --> 09:34.462
Ashley. Ashley.

09:34.464 --> 09:36.400
Ashley.

10:09.899 --> 10:12.333
Jacky. Jack!

10:12.335 --> 10:14.102
Jacky.

10:14.104 --> 10:16.103
I got here as fast as I could.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.312
Jack.

10:23.379 --> 10:25.316
I'm so sorry, J.

10:30.386 --> 10:32.322
I'm so sorry, J.

10:34.390 --> 10:37.090
522 South 57th,

10:37.092 --> 10:39.828
stating 3929,
possible murder-suicide.

10:39.830 --> 10:43.100
<i>Last time
when I spoke to Ashley...</i>

10:45.168 --> 10:48.438
<i>...she was trying to talk to me
about her dad.</i>

10:51.173 --> 10:55.609
<i>My brother doing all of this,</i>

10:55.611 --> 10:59.415
<i>me not seeing he was capable...</i>

11:02.852 --> 11:04.853
<i>I might as well have done it.</i>

11:04.855 --> 11:06.387
<i>No.</i>

11:06.389 --> 11:08.022
<i>No, Jack.</i>

11:08.024 --> 11:10.458
<i>No, this is not on you.</i>

11:10.460 --> 11:12.396
<i>It's not.</i>

11:14.530 --> 11:16.631
<i>Five or six times a day,</i>

11:16.633 --> 11:19.103
<i>people have been saying
they're gonna pray for me.</i>

11:21.171 --> 11:23.107
<i>I pray...</i>

11:25.174 --> 11:27.577
<i>I pray to undo it.</i>

11:29.044 --> 11:31.548
Amen.

11:33.616 --> 11:35.215
<i>I prayed that God</i>

11:35.217 --> 11:37.451
<i>would give me
a second chance, Bobby.</i>

11:40.456 --> 11:42.991
Tell me this ain't true, man.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.929
Tell me this isn't happening.

11:46.328 --> 11:48.930
I mean, some-somehow,

11:48.932 --> 11:51.031
Jack, I-I...

11:51.033 --> 11:55.103
I-I just think somehow
you're gonna get through this.

11:55.105 --> 11:58.640
But you cannot blame yourself.

11:58.642 --> 12:01.441
People with your brother's kind
of illness,

12:01.443 --> 12:04.514
they hide
those sorts of things, Jack.

12:15.958 --> 12:19.459
Hi. I'm Ashley,
and I'm the birthday queen.

12:19.461 --> 12:22.629
And at the smoker,
we have my dear old Uncle Jack,

12:22.631 --> 12:24.398
probably making sure
Bobby O. doesn't overcook

12:24.400 --> 12:26.633
- his famous pulled pork.
- Come on, come on.

12:26.635 --> 12:28.169
That's gonna be so tender,

12:28.171 --> 12:29.603
when you touch it,
it's just gonna go...

12:29.605 --> 12:30.972
Oh.

12:30.974 --> 12:32.239
Okay, sure.

12:32.241 --> 12:35.475
And at the bar, my mom and my...

12:35.477 --> 12:37.111
What are you guys doing?

12:37.113 --> 12:39.180
- Uh, hey!
- Hi, baby.

12:39.182 --> 12:40.480
Love you.

12:40.482 --> 12:42.215
I love you guys, too.

12:42.217 --> 12:45.085
And over here,
we have Mr. Wilco.

12:45.087 --> 12:46.688
Hi, buddy. Ooh!

12:46.690 --> 12:50.023
Hi. The most beautiful dog
in the world.

12:50.025 --> 12:52.660
- Yeah.
- Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

12:52.662 --> 12:56.030
Hi.

12:56.032 --> 12:58.366
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

12:58.368 --> 13:00.001
- We love you, girl.
- Thank you.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.636
- Happy birthday. My girls.
- Thank you so much.

13:01.638 --> 13:03.470
- Yay!
- Now you got a mustache.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.738
All right.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.074
Whoo-hoo!

13:06.076 --> 13:08.345
Happy birthday to me!

14:12.741 --> 14:14.642
We're sorry.
You have reached a number

14:14.644 --> 14:17.145
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.446
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

14:19.448 --> 14:21.815
please check the number
and try your call again.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.456
Hey.

14:28.457 --> 14:30.458
Can you look something up
for me?

14:34.563 --> 14:36.464
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

14:36.466 --> 14:38.098
Hey, Jack.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.333
What are you doing here?

14:39.335 --> 14:40.767
My niece's cell.

14:40.769 --> 14:42.436
Apparently, it was tagged
and photographed,

14:42.438 --> 14:44.171
but somehow it's not
in the property room.

14:44.173 --> 14:45.373
You know where it is?

14:45.375 --> 14:46.607
It should have been left
at the scene

14:46.609 --> 14:48.175
for the fingerprint tech
to bag it

14:48.177 --> 14:49.676
and bring it in here
with everything else.

14:49.678 --> 14:52.216
<i>But I don't know
if the bozo did it.</i>

15:53.743 --> 15:55.679
Hello?

16:00.783 --> 16:02.617
Hello?

16:02.619 --> 16:04.555
Hey.

16:13.462 --> 16:15.399
Hello?

16:24.474 --> 16:26.410
Who is this?

16:28.811 --> 16:30.747
Who do you think it is?

16:38.654 --> 16:40.591
Hel-Hello?

16:43.326 --> 16:46.826
O-Okay. Um, I-I don't know

16:46.828 --> 16:48.764
if our lines are crossed
or what, but...

16:50.332 --> 16:53.269
I hope you just didn't die.

16:54.671 --> 16:57.338
All right. Bye.

17:34.943 --> 17:37.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:39.615 --> 17:42.350
How you doing, brother?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.017
I'm all right.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.955
Uh, come on in.

17:49.558 --> 17:53.260
I'm sorry for just dropping by
like this, but, uh...

17:53.262 --> 17:55.028
- It's all good.
- Well, you know,

17:55.030 --> 17:57.731
Alice remembers
you liking her lasagna.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.533
So, she heard I was coming by,

17:59.535 --> 18:01.505
she went straight
in that kitchen and...

18:02.904 --> 18:04.939
- Thank you.
- Oh, by the way,

18:04.941 --> 18:06.841
uh, Miles wanted me
to let you know

18:06.843 --> 18:10.948
Cooper had absolutely nothing
to do with making the card.

18:15.317 --> 18:16.651
That supposed to be me?

18:16.653 --> 18:19.386
I guess.

18:19.388 --> 18:21.857
- Thank him for me, okay?
- Okay.

18:29.365 --> 18:31.934
Now, you finding
what you're looking for?

18:37.707 --> 18:40.644
I feel like
I'm going crazy here, man.

18:43.046 --> 18:45.046
Jack...

18:45.048 --> 18:48.048
you're going through
the hardest thing in the world.

18:48.050 --> 18:51.384
You're allowed to feel crazy.

18:51.386 --> 18:52.753
Right?

18:52.755 --> 18:54.258
Yeah.

18:55.357 --> 18:57.293
Yeah, I guess.

18:59.695 --> 19:02.298
Yeah, thanks
for the reassurance, man.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.535
Thanks for coming by.

19:06.635 --> 19:08.571
Actually, I...

19:10.105 --> 19:12.806
I didn't come to reassure you.

19:12.808 --> 19:15.008
Or bring lasagna.

19:15.010 --> 19:18.845
I have something to lay on you.
It's a little bit heavy.

19:18.847 --> 19:20.381
Your brother's case...

19:20.383 --> 19:22.650
bottom line,
we have to rule you out for it.

19:22.652 --> 19:25.719
I.A. noticed
I haven't been doing that.

19:25.721 --> 19:30.093
So, before you go talk to them,
Jack, is there anything...

19:31.124 --> 19:34.498
anything
that you want to tell me?

19:36.398 --> 19:38.399
<i>So, uh, first things first, uh,</i>

19:38.401 --> 19:41.434
we have it here you stated
before your shift

19:41.436 --> 19:43.636
the night of the murders
you were home alone.

19:43.638 --> 19:45.038
- Is that right?
- Yes.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.007
Okay.

19:47.009 --> 19:49.442
You told, uh, Detective Owens

19:49.444 --> 19:51.444
your brother recently acted
a little erratic

19:51.446 --> 19:53.980
but you didn't see it
as a big deal.

19:53.982 --> 19:56.383
Well, he forgot an obligation
with my niece,

19:56.385 --> 19:58.119
which wasn't really erratic.

19:58.121 --> 19:59.754
It was typical.

19:59.756 --> 20:02.890
So I gave him an earful
and let it go.

20:02.892 --> 20:04.892
Your sister-in-law.

20:04.894 --> 20:07.694
Did you find her attractive?

20:07.696 --> 20:10.163
You two ever flirt?

20:10.165 --> 20:12.432
I mean, by all accounts,

20:12.434 --> 20:15.702
you played hero
for your niece a lot.

20:15.704 --> 20:18.939
So one could imagine that might
have worn on your brother some.

20:18.941 --> 20:21.508
Then again,
maybe if there was some...

20:21.510 --> 20:24.545
you know,
incident with the wife...

20:24.547 --> 20:27.515
that's the kind of thing
that could set a guy off.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.016
Okay, let me be blunt.

20:29.018 --> 20:30.884
Please.

20:30.886 --> 20:33.453
I'm imagining
a scenario like this.

20:33.455 --> 20:35.956
Your niece calls you up crying,

20:35.958 --> 20:38.491
and her dad's drunk

20:38.493 --> 20:41.027
and yelling and throwing lamps,
and-and you're pissed.

20:41.029 --> 20:43.497
He's misbehaving
right after you already

20:43.499 --> 20:45.466
gave him your earful, right?

20:45.468 --> 20:47.468
So you fly over there hot,
confronting him,

20:47.470 --> 20:48.736
and now things are getting
really hot.

20:48.738 --> 20:50.136
And so I shoot
my own brother, right?

20:50.138 --> 20:51.872
- And your sister-in-law's freaking.
- Okay.

20:51.874 --> 20:53.440
- And the dog's barking and everything...
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:53.442 --> 20:56.009
You know what? You got me.

20:56.011 --> 20:57.812
I did it.

20:57.814 --> 20:59.814
I killed them all.

20:59.816 --> 21:01.649
Even the dog.

21:48.998 --> 21:50.933
Hello?

21:55.738 --> 21:57.673
Hello?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.673
- Hello?
- Hello?

22:00.675 --> 22:02.109
Uncle Jack, is anyone there?

22:02.111 --> 22:03.811
Yeah.

22:03.813 --> 22:06.145
So, when I...
when I called you before,

22:06.147 --> 22:08.748
did you hear me at all?

22:08.750 --> 22:11.218
Did you not see
that I called you?

22:15.758 --> 22:18.127
Uncle Jack, are you
ignoring me or what?

22:21.029 --> 22:23.232
Where are you calling from?

22:24.866 --> 22:27.801
Where am I calling from?

22:27.803 --> 22:29.840
Yeah.

22:32.307 --> 22:36.276
Um, okay, I'm-I'm at my house
in my bedroom

22:36.278 --> 22:38.781
in Los Angeles, California.

22:41.616 --> 22:43.316
Uncle Jack, I don't know
what's going on,

22:43.318 --> 22:45.585
but if you don't want
to talk right now...

22:45.587 --> 22:47.555
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

22:47.557 --> 22:49.256
Let-let's talk, yeah.
Uh, we should talk.

22:49.258 --> 22:51.725
Uh... what do you want
to talk about?

22:51.727 --> 22:55.296
I mean, I guess I just wanted
to say thank you, really.

22:55.298 --> 22:57.965
My dad said
you gave him quite a speech

22:57.967 --> 23:00.199
about not picking me up
the other night.

23:00.201 --> 23:03.069
Whatever you said, it really
snapped him into shape.

23:03.071 --> 23:05.238
I know they were just
kissing my butt,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.740
but my dad bought me
this new bike

23:07.742 --> 23:10.944
I've been begging for
for, like, 15 years.

23:10.946 --> 23:15.181
Then they took me to Stefano's
for a makeup dinner, of course.

23:15.183 --> 23:18.251
- And believe it or not, I finally...
- Oh, my...

23:18.253 --> 23:20.754
...ordered the garlic
chicken dish thing.

23:20.756 --> 23:22.690
And you weren't wrong.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.726
It was delicious.

23:25.728 --> 23:27.827
But a lot of garlic,
though, right?

23:27.829 --> 23:29.963
Yeah, super garlicky.

23:29.965 --> 23:32.199
Actually, after dinner,
we ended up hanging out

23:32.201 --> 23:33.834
and breathing garlic
on each other

23:33.836 --> 23:35.702
until, like, 1:00 a.m.

23:35.704 --> 23:37.337
while we were listening
to some old stuff

23:37.339 --> 23:38.506
from my dad's record collection.

23:38.508 --> 23:41.174
By the way, have you ever
heard of a band called ESG?

23:41.176 --> 23:42.343
- Ash?
- Yeah?

23:42.345 --> 23:43.876
- At Stefano's...
- Mm-hmm.

23:43.878 --> 23:46.246
...uh, the other night,
after dinner,

23:46.248 --> 23:49.248
I bet you had...

23:49.250 --> 23:52.853
a hot fudge sundae
with two cherries on top.

23:52.855 --> 23:54.787
Am I right?

23:55.891 --> 23:58.057
Um, uh, what?

23:58.059 --> 24:00.960
Uh, how-how did you know that?

24:00.962 --> 24:04.398
Did you just turn psychic
or something?

24:04.400 --> 24:05.932
<i>What is it?</i>

24:05.934 --> 24:07.834
<i>Do you have a crystal ball?</i>

24:07.836 --> 24:12.072
<i>Look into his eyes.</i>

24:12.074 --> 24:14.274
<i>He's got ESP.</i>

24:14.276 --> 24:17.745
<i>Jack Radcliff...
fortune-teller detective,</i>

24:17.747 --> 24:21.248
<i>solving cases no one else can.</i>

24:21.250 --> 24:23.150
<i>Supercop.</i>

24:23.152 --> 24:26.819
<i>Seer of hot fudge sundaes.</i>

24:26.821 --> 24:28.322
Ash, you said...

24:28.324 --> 24:29.957
you said you were
at home, right?

24:29.959 --> 24:31.424
Yeah.

24:31.426 --> 24:34.961
Your mom and dad...
they home with you right now?

24:34.963 --> 24:38.164
Mm, no. Um, my mom's at work,
and my dad went out to go

24:38.166 --> 24:40.703
watch some game or something.
I don't know.

24:42.270 --> 24:44.037
Hey, Ash?

24:44.039 --> 24:45.975
Mm-hmm.

24:47.710 --> 24:49.809
I'm about to ask you something

24:49.811 --> 24:51.911
that's gonna make
absolutely no sense,

24:51.913 --> 24:53.846
but do me a favor.

24:53.848 --> 24:57.351
I don't want you to...
I don't want you to ask me why.

24:57.353 --> 25:00.624
Just... just want you
to trust me.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.123
Okay?

25:04.794 --> 25:06.693
Can you do that for me?

25:06.695 --> 25:08.862
I-I mean, I guess so.

25:08.864 --> 25:11.164
Okay, in your dad's shed
out back,

25:11.166 --> 25:14.133
the last time I looked,
there was some spray paint

25:14.135 --> 25:16.172
on his work bench.

25:17.740 --> 25:21.107
I want you to go in there,
grab it,

25:21.109 --> 25:23.712
and, um...

25:26.015 --> 25:29.283
I want you to...
spray something on the...

25:29.285 --> 25:31.451
on the doors of the shed.

25:31.453 --> 25:33.219
Like what?

25:33.221 --> 25:35.189
Paint a... paint a big red "X."

25:35.191 --> 25:36.923
A big red "X"?

25:36.925 --> 25:39.325
A big...

25:39.327 --> 25:41.461
fat red "X."

25:41.463 --> 25:44.064
Okay?

25:44.066 --> 25:46.132
Uh, okay. I'll call
you back when it's done.

25:46.134 --> 25:47.500
No. Wait. Wait.
Well, you-you don't have

25:47.502 --> 25:49.036
- to get off.
- Later, alligator.

25:49.038 --> 25:51.104
Ash? Ashley?

27:28.871 --> 27:30.203
- Ashley.
- Hey, hey, you're never gonna...

27:30.205 --> 27:31.505
Hang on. Hang on.
There's something

27:31.507 --> 27:33.273
- I need to ask.
- Okay.

27:33.275 --> 27:35.142
For some reason,
my... my phone's acting up,

27:35.144 --> 27:36.442
not showing a date.

27:36.444 --> 27:38.144
Can you look at your phone

27:38.146 --> 27:39.846
and-and tell me what it is?

27:39.848 --> 27:41.047
Uh, okay.

27:41.049 --> 27:44.918
Um, all right, so it's, uh...

27:44.920 --> 27:46.855
J-June 25.

27:49.325 --> 27:51.557
You said it's June 25 today?

27:51.559 --> 27:53.594
Yes, but listen,

27:53.596 --> 27:55.362
I-I did
what your weird butt asked,

27:55.364 --> 27:57.497
but unbelievably,
while I was in here

27:57.499 --> 27:59.632
doing the deed,
my dad pulled in the driveway

27:59.634 --> 28:01.301
in some weird white car,

28:01.303 --> 28:03.370
- and now I'm trapped.
- What you... what you...?

28:03.372 --> 28:05.171
What you mean,
a weird white car?

28:05.173 --> 28:07.908
Just some weird white car
pulled up in the driveway,

28:07.910 --> 28:10.009
so I freaked out
and pulled the doors closed.

28:10.011 --> 28:11.612
You pulled the door?

28:11.614 --> 28:13.580
Okay, uh...

28:13.582 --> 28:15.114
was your dad driving it?

28:15.116 --> 28:17.383
No. He's in the passenger side.

28:17.385 --> 28:19.052
You recognize the driver?

28:19.054 --> 28:21.622
No. I-I...
No, I can't really see.

28:21.624 --> 28:24.524
Ashley, if you can, I want you
to carefully peek out

28:24.526 --> 28:26.927
and see if you can read
the license plate

28:26.929 --> 28:29.563
or-or get a good look
at the guy behind the wheel.

28:29.565 --> 28:31.134
Can you do that?

28:36.471 --> 28:38.171
Ashley, where'd you go?

28:38.173 --> 28:40.340
Shh. Hang on. I'm looking.

28:44.346 --> 28:47.247
S-So, unfortunately, no.

28:47.249 --> 28:49.082
I-I can't see the plates.

28:49.084 --> 28:51.051
'Cause of
the way the car is parked.

28:51.053 --> 28:53.353
Uh... what kind of car is it?

28:53.355 --> 28:55.288
It looks old. I...

28:55.290 --> 28:58.190
I'm not quite sure what it is.

28:58.192 --> 28:59.692
It's a sports car.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.460
It's a sports car with...

29:01.462 --> 29:03.229
big lights, like frog eyes.

29:03.231 --> 29:05.364
Uh, Ashley, I...

29:05.366 --> 29:08.401
I need you
to be very, very specific.

29:08.403 --> 29:10.202
Look closely.

29:10.204 --> 29:11.571
Maybe...

29:11.573 --> 29:13.306
you can see an emblem
or something?

29:13.308 --> 29:15.676
Yeah, there was. A-A tiny one.

29:15.678 --> 29:17.611
But the car just drove away.

29:17.613 --> 29:20.247
- With or without your dad?
- With him.

29:20.249 --> 29:21.648
That's good.
You can come out.

29:21.650 --> 29:23.182
Yeah, I know.

29:23.184 --> 29:24.551
I'm already out.

29:24.553 --> 29:26.652
Okay, so confess.

29:26.654 --> 29:29.925
Why in the world did you just
have me do that?

29:31.460 --> 29:33.395
Hello?

29:36.498 --> 29:38.468
Ashley, I need you to think.

29:40.269 --> 29:42.635
Think about what?

29:42.637 --> 29:45.706
About if anything unusual's
been going on,

29:45.708 --> 29:47.673
like the thing
with the white car.

29:47.675 --> 29:50.043
You know, new people.

29:50.045 --> 29:51.978
Conversation you overheard
that seemed strange.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.347
Maybe... maybe something
having to do with your mom?

29:54.349 --> 29:57.351
Maybe they had a big fight
recently, or...

29:57.353 --> 30:00.253
maybe you noticed your dad
seemed to have stopped

30:00.255 --> 30:02.255
taking his medications.

30:02.257 --> 30:03.623
I-I don't understand.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.491
Why are you even asking?

30:05.493 --> 30:08.495
The truth is,
all this is about a case,

30:08.497 --> 30:10.063
but it's not an ordinary case.

30:10.065 --> 30:11.698
It's a case to do with your dad.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.700
A case?
Well, what kind of case?

30:14.702 --> 30:17.437
It could be he's gotten
into some of the same stuff

30:17.439 --> 30:19.605
that got him in trouble
when you were little.

30:19.607 --> 30:22.676
And if that's true,
we have got to protect him.

30:22.678 --> 30:24.777
You're saying
he's doing it again?

30:24.779 --> 30:26.712
He-he's dealing drugs again?

30:26.714 --> 30:29.716
It's possible, yes.

30:29.718 --> 30:31.718
Well, I mean,

30:31.720 --> 30:36.055
if-if he's off his medications,
he really doesn't seem like it.

30:36.057 --> 30:38.758
He seems good, and to answer
your other question,

30:38.760 --> 30:41.260
him and my mom
haven't been fighting at all,

30:41.262 --> 30:43.196
at least from what I've seen.

30:43.198 --> 30:45.498
They've actually been
very sweet and cuddly

30:45.500 --> 30:46.699
with each other lately.

30:46.701 --> 30:48.334
They seem really good.

30:48.336 --> 30:52.738
And if I really think about it,
especially my dad.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.274
He's been in a good mood,

30:54.276 --> 30:56.476
and he's been getting back
into his music.

30:56.478 --> 30:59.613
Actually, he's been writing
this really beautiful new song.

30:59.615 --> 31:01.748
I don't think it's gonna be
a hit or anything,

31:01.750 --> 31:03.283
but it's really pretty.

31:03.285 --> 31:05.552
I guess I'm saying I-I just...

31:05.554 --> 31:07.821
think he's doing good
when he's playing his music.

31:07.823 --> 31:10.056
Usually, if he's depressed
or off his meds,

31:10.058 --> 31:12.191
he's just... kind of quits.

31:12.193 --> 31:13.826
- Hey, Ash.
- Uh-huh.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.665
Have you ever heard
the name "Georgie" before?

31:18.666 --> 31:21.634
I don't think so.

31:21.636 --> 31:23.569
Why?

31:23.571 --> 31:25.572
Who's Georgie?

31:25.574 --> 31:27.373
I don't know.

31:31.814 --> 31:34.113
You going somewhere?

31:34.115 --> 31:37.452
Oh, yeah. Uh, just...
just back to my room.

31:38.686 --> 31:40.622
Why?

31:43.592 --> 31:46.226
Which part of your room,
exactly?

31:46.228 --> 31:49.065
Um... I'm over by my window.

31:54.803 --> 31:56.739
Hello?

31:58.539 --> 32:00.774
Hey, Ash?

32:00.776 --> 32:02.711
Yeah.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.150
Did you just get
your room repainted?

32:08.383 --> 32:10.283
Sor-Sorry. H-How...?

32:10.285 --> 32:12.321
How in the heck
do you know that?

32:15.857 --> 32:19.392
Uncle Jack,
how do you know that?!

32:19.394 --> 32:21.694
'Cause I was looking
at your dad's credit report

32:21.696 --> 32:23.296
'cause of the case.

32:23.298 --> 32:26.866
I saw a receipt
for, uh... for paint.

32:26.868 --> 32:29.803
Right. Okay. I mean, yeah.

32:29.805 --> 32:32.506
He repainted it a few days ago.

32:32.508 --> 32:34.507
I guess as part
of kissing my butt

32:34.509 --> 32:36.343
for screwing up the other night.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.178
He did the whole thing himself.

32:38.180 --> 32:40.313
Which was nice
but slightly annoying,

32:40.315 --> 32:42.882
because you know how
when painters paint

32:42.884 --> 32:44.750
and they do a sloppy job

32:44.752 --> 32:46.853
and they accidentally
seal up the cracks?

32:46.855 --> 32:48.822
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's what happened,

32:48.824 --> 32:50.690
and now my window's stuck.

32:50.692 --> 32:52.659
Your window's stuck?

32:52.661 --> 32:54.661
Yeah, it's totally sealed shut.

32:54.663 --> 32:57.296
I don't think I can open it
without a crowbar.

32:57.298 --> 33:00.600
But what are we doing
talking about my window?

33:00.602 --> 33:03.769
Ugh. It's too bad I don't
know his e-mail password

33:03.771 --> 33:06.672
so I could check and see
if there's a Georgie...

33:06.674 --> 33:08.674
or...

33:08.676 --> 33:11.378
You know what?
One thing I could maybe do...

33:11.380 --> 33:13.846
I could Google the bug-eyed car
and try to figure out

33:13.848 --> 33:15.681
what kind it is.

33:15.683 --> 33:18.418
Or, I mean, if-if it comes back,

33:18.420 --> 33:19.853
I-I could go outside

33:19.855 --> 33:21.955
and see if there's plates
on the rear.

33:21.957 --> 33:24.490
But, of course, who knows
if that'll ever happen?

33:24.492 --> 33:26.293
Uh-oh. Crap.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.661
Okay, uh,

33:27.663 --> 33:29.595
- I think I got to go.
- Is that Wilco?

33:29.597 --> 33:30.729
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Wilco.

33:30.731 --> 33:32.298
He says hello, but, Uncle Jack,

33:32.300 --> 33:34.334
I think my dad is just
walking in the door,

33:34.336 --> 33:36.236
and I've got red paint
all over my hands,

33:36.238 --> 33:38.470
so I got to wash up
before he comes in. Uh...

33:38.472 --> 33:40.239
But you know what?

33:40.241 --> 33:42.209
I'll try to think
about who Georgie is,

33:42.211 --> 33:43.576
and I'll call you back, okay?

33:43.578 --> 33:44.944
- Love you, Uncle Jack.
- Wait! W...

33:44.946 --> 33:46.882
Bye.

33:53.555 --> 33:55.791
Oh, God.

33:57.291 --> 33:59.461
Oh, God.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.813
Jack?

34:53.815 --> 34:55.614
I heard you were in the office.

34:55.617 --> 34:57.583
What are you...
what are you doing here?

34:57.585 --> 34:59.885
Uh, my leave days are up soon.

34:59.887 --> 35:02.688
I figure, what's the difference?

35:02.690 --> 35:05.992
"Two days to live"?
What's that?

35:05.994 --> 35:08.662
Uh, I'm just
reconstructing the timeline...

35:08.664 --> 35:10.932
what happened
before what and when.

35:13.802 --> 35:15.738
Is that a problem, sir?

35:18.507 --> 35:20.610
Let's go to my office.

35:37.992 --> 35:40.793
Close the door behind you, Jack.

35:40.795 --> 35:42.595
Oh, did I show you?

35:42.597 --> 35:44.363
They just got into the playoffs.

35:45.934 --> 35:48.971
Bobby's boy Cooper pitched
for a save to get us there.

35:50.072 --> 35:51.704
That's great.

35:51.706 --> 35:54.042
Yeah, it is.

35:56.378 --> 35:58.345
So...

35:58.347 --> 36:00.679
<i>What's going on?</i>

36:00.681 --> 36:02.548
<i>Are you not satisfied
with the way</i>

36:02.550 --> 36:04.516
<i>your partner's been handling
your family's case?</i>

36:04.518 --> 36:05.952
<i>Well...</i>

36:05.954 --> 36:08.054
<i>something a little strange
happened.</i>

36:08.056 --> 36:10.055
<i>I got a couple calls</i>

36:10.057 --> 36:12.858
from what appeared
to be my niece's cell.

36:12.860 --> 36:15.595
I guess I've just been
looking for an explanation.

36:15.597 --> 36:18.067
That's why you went over there
and collected her phone?

36:21.068 --> 36:23.135
You hear that from Bobby?

36:25.106 --> 36:26.976
Take a seat.

36:29.411 --> 36:32.112
<i>Something
I need to make clear to you.</i>

36:32.114 --> 36:35.715
<i>The fact that Bobby didn't walk
into my office straightaway,</i>

36:35.717 --> 36:38.751
that he waited until you had
tampered with state's evidence

36:38.753 --> 36:41.920
before he said anything,
was not very smart.

36:41.922 --> 36:44.391
You should have come to me,
Jack, talked it over.

36:44.393 --> 36:46.092
Respectfully, sir,
if I'd run it by you,

36:46.094 --> 36:47.860
you'd have told me I had PTSD

36:47.862 --> 36:49.631
and recommended
I check in for treatment.

36:50.731 --> 36:52.632
Look...

36:52.634 --> 36:54.967
I believe if you want
to go see a psychologist,

36:54.969 --> 36:56.869
it's up to you
to make that decision.

36:56.871 --> 36:58.804
But since you haven't,
I feel I need

36:58.806 --> 37:02.008
to say some things to you,
and not just as your boss.

37:02.010 --> 37:05.177
<i>One thing I know to be true...</i>

37:05.179 --> 37:08.148
you have to move forward.

37:08.150 --> 37:09.949
You have to believe

37:09.951 --> 37:11.950
that there's a spot
out there for you

37:11.952 --> 37:13.722
where things are
gonna be better.

37:16.791 --> 37:19.425
Yes, sir.

37:19.427 --> 37:21.594
I hear you.
I-I really do. Um...

37:21.596 --> 37:23.061
Do you?

37:23.063 --> 37:24.866
Because I sense a "but."

37:28.936 --> 37:31.037
On your wall,
you pinned up a note.

37:31.039 --> 37:33.740
"Talk to them about Georgie."

37:33.742 --> 37:35.778
<i>You want
to tell me what that's about?</i>

37:38.679 --> 37:41.713
It was a message
my brother wrote to himself

37:41.715 --> 37:43.518
I found in his house.

37:47.856 --> 37:49.892
Does it mean something to you?

37:54.762 --> 37:56.229
Who is he?

38:04.039 --> 38:06.039
There's a bunch of random

38:06.041 --> 38:09.141
narcotics cases
this guy was associated with.

38:09.143 --> 38:11.177
And given
your brother's history,

38:11.179 --> 38:14.680
it wouldn't surprise me if he'd
had some dealings with him.

38:14.682 --> 38:16.516
Unfortunately, the only piece

38:16.518 --> 38:19.521
of actual evidence we've got
on him is literally right here.

38:20.856 --> 38:22.688
Now, we've heard his name
for years,

38:22.690 --> 38:24.523
but nobody's actually
ever seen him,

38:24.525 --> 38:27.860
except for one deceased witness
who helped us get this drawing.

38:27.862 --> 38:29.862
You're telling me
it's a dead end?

38:29.864 --> 38:32.965
No, I'm telling you
this guy is a white whale.

38:32.967 --> 38:37.269
If you ask me,
take everything off your wall,

38:37.271 --> 38:39.805
take whatever remaining days
you have left,

38:39.807 --> 38:41.744
cash in your sick days, too.

38:43.878 --> 38:47.713
Thank you, sir.
I think you're 100% correct.

38:47.715 --> 38:50.083
Cash in my days.

38:50.085 --> 38:53.019
Everything comes off the wall.

39:16.210 --> 39:18.213
<i>I want you to look at this.</i>

39:20.047 --> 39:22.817
- Okay.
- Look carefully.

39:24.652 --> 39:26.686
Now, what is this?

39:26.688 --> 39:28.891
Why are you showing me this?

39:32.059 --> 39:35.862
My brother... he preferred
vodka drenched in OJ.

39:35.864 --> 39:39.032
He liked his drinks
sweet and mixed.

39:39.034 --> 39:41.266
Look at the bottle on the bed.

39:41.268 --> 39:43.101
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon.

39:43.103 --> 39:44.903
Now, okay,
maybe he was desperate

39:44.905 --> 39:47.206
and there was nothing else
in the house, right?

39:47.208 --> 39:49.144
Wrong. Next picture.

39:50.244 --> 39:52.244
Vodka.

39:52.246 --> 39:54.179
So all the evidence is clear.

39:54.181 --> 39:57.617
My brother was a bipolar,
gun-owning,

39:57.619 --> 39:59.217
pill-popping lunatic.

39:59.219 --> 40:02.088
Very dramatic,
all spilled all over the bed

40:02.090 --> 40:03.690
like he was going crazy.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.023
- Come on, man.
- Wow.

40:05.025 --> 40:06.694
That was staged.

40:18.139 --> 40:20.305
I got to take this.
Sorry, man.

40:20.307 --> 40:22.677
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:25.347 --> 40:27.347
Hey, Ashley.

40:27.349 --> 40:29.682
Hey, so you know the name
you gave me... "Georgie"?

40:29.684 --> 40:31.117
When my dad wasn't looking,

40:31.119 --> 40:33.686
I think I found something
in his old day planner.

40:33.688 --> 40:35.021
Found what?

40:35.023 --> 40:36.755
- His last name?
- No.

40:36.757 --> 40:38.257
I couldn't find his last name.

40:38.259 --> 40:40.360
But I think I found his address.

40:40.362 --> 40:42.028
That's incredible.

40:42.030 --> 40:43.896
Okay, give it to me.

40:43.898 --> 40:46.398
- I will in just a minute.
- What...?

40:46.400 --> 40:48.668
What does that mean...
"in just a minute"?

40:48.670 --> 40:51.237
Well, uh, Wilco and I
are actually

40:51.239 --> 40:53.708
on your street,
about ten seconds away.

40:55.143 --> 40:57.677
Ashley?
No, you-you... you can't.

40:57.679 --> 40:59.144
I can't? Why not?

40:59.146 --> 41:01.748
- I'm not at home right now.
- Well,

41:01.750 --> 41:03.349
that's kind of funny,
because all your lights are on,

41:03.351 --> 41:05.651
- and it looks like if I were to ring your door...
- No!

41:05.653 --> 41:07.320
- Wha...?
- No, Ashley,

41:07.322 --> 41:11.157
I need... I need you
to turn around and go. Okay?

41:11.159 --> 41:13.159
Oh, I mean, okay, I heard you,

41:13.161 --> 41:16.028
but why does it sound like
the sky's about to fall?

41:16.030 --> 41:17.863
I know it's confusing.

41:17.865 --> 41:20.432
Thing is, your-your dad is in
such deep trouble right now,

41:20.434 --> 41:22.434
there may be people
watching my house.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.670
In fact,
while this is happening,

41:24.672 --> 41:26.371
if we see each other in person,

41:26.373 --> 41:29.175
we should probably pretend
like none of this is going on.

41:29.177 --> 41:32.010
Okay? You still there?

41:32.012 --> 41:33.713
Ashley?

41:33.715 --> 41:35.981
Y-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

41:35.983 --> 41:39.952
Tell me you are
turning around and going.

41:39.954 --> 41:42.688
Uh... yeah.

41:42.690 --> 41:44.222
Yeah, we're going now.

41:44.224 --> 41:45.791
Look, let's say this.

41:45.793 --> 41:47.025
Tell me the address.

41:47.027 --> 41:48.760
I'm gonna go check it out,
and then

41:48.762 --> 41:50.195
- let's talk after.
- Sure.

41:50.197 --> 41:51.863
Good. Good, good, good.

41:51.865 --> 41:56.639
O-Okay, so it's
1696 South Cochran Avenue.

43:38.239 --> 43:40.840
Oh, shit.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.068
Bobby.

45:17.538 --> 45:19.237
- Jacky.
- Property room.

45:19.239 --> 45:20.639
Hey, what the hell
happened to you?

45:20.641 --> 45:22.041
Property room.

45:22.043 --> 45:24.543
- Property room.
- The pro-property room?

45:24.545 --> 45:25.644
What are you talking about?

45:25.646 --> 45:28.014
Jack, right now we've got to
get you to a hospital.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.615
- No, man. There's no time.
- He's been shot.

45:29.617 --> 45:31.950
- No, Jack, come on. "No time."
- There's no time. No time.

45:31.952 --> 45:33.952
"No time." What do you mean,
there's no time?

45:33.954 --> 45:35.354
She's dying tomorrow.

45:35.356 --> 45:38.490
Ashley...
I got to save her.

45:38.492 --> 45:41.927
Jacky. Jacky.

45:41.929 --> 45:44.132
- Where you go... Jacky. Ja...
- Hey.

45:46.434 --> 45:48.166
What is it you need him to pull?

45:48.168 --> 45:50.503
Just get me in there.
It's important.

45:50.505 --> 45:52.070
It's on me.

45:52.072 --> 45:53.706
- Let us in.
- Okay.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.307
Call an EMT.

45:55.309 --> 45:57.411
Keep everybody out of here.

45:59.981 --> 46:02.517
Jack. Hey. Hey.

46:04.117 --> 46:06.052
Jack.

46:06.054 --> 46:08.688
Jack. Hey, Jack.

46:08.690 --> 46:10.958
Down here, Jack.

46:18.132 --> 46:20.231
Okay, so what are we doing?

46:20.233 --> 46:21.700
Ja-Jack. Hey.

46:21.702 --> 46:24.269
What are you looking for?

46:24.271 --> 46:26.639
This was delivered on a Monday.

46:26.641 --> 46:29.474
Today... today's...

46:29.476 --> 46:31.577
This is Tuesday morning, right?

46:31.579 --> 46:33.746
Yeah.
It's Tuesday morning, Jack.

46:33.748 --> 46:36.481
That means it's Tuesday
morning for her, too.

46:36.483 --> 46:40.019
For her, who?

46:44.759 --> 46:47.126
I got to get this.

46:47.128 --> 46:49.064
I got to get it.

46:55.436 --> 46:58.771
- Hey. Ash?
- Hello?

46:58.773 --> 47:00.405
Ash.

47:00.407 --> 47:02.041
- Come on!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell

47:02.043 --> 47:03.608
- you got your guns out for?
- Wh-What was that?

47:03.610 --> 47:04.744
- J-Just stay back.
- W-Was that for me?

47:04.746 --> 47:07.545
Hel-Hello, Uncle Jack?

47:07.547 --> 47:08.613
- Hello?
- Ashley.

47:08.615 --> 47:10.485
- Ashley.
- Stay back.

47:12.219 --> 47:13.619
I've got no choice.

47:15.422 --> 47:18.523
Uncle Jack, you...
you have no choice about what?

47:18.525 --> 47:21.226
As soon as we get off,

47:21.228 --> 47:25.498
I'm gonna need you to call 911.

47:25.500 --> 47:29.200
Say... say you want your dad
locked up.

47:29.202 --> 47:31.637
Wait. Why would we
want him locked up?

47:31.639 --> 47:33.304
Tell them about the drugs.

47:33.306 --> 47:35.407
What? What drugs?

47:35.409 --> 47:38.077
They're in the box
under his bed.

47:38.079 --> 47:40.479
O-Okay.
Okay, but what is this?

47:40.481 --> 47:42.313
What the hell is going on?

47:42.315 --> 47:44.617
Someone's coming
to kill your dad.

47:44.619 --> 47:47.086
Who's coming to kill my dad?

47:47.088 --> 47:48.653
Seriously, Uncle Jack.

47:48.655 --> 47:52.758
Ash, I want you
to write this number down.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.161
- Okay.
- 213...

47:55.163 --> 47:59.498
- 213.
- 555...

47:59.500 --> 48:01.434
28...

48:01.436 --> 48:04.103
- 28...
- 09.

48:04.105 --> 48:06.072
- You got that?
- Zero... Yes, I wrote it down.

48:06.074 --> 48:07.606
But-but whose number is this?

48:07.608 --> 48:10.409
It's Bobby's number.

48:10.411 --> 48:12.211
You call him...

48:12.213 --> 48:15.414
if you need it.

48:15.416 --> 48:17.316
- Okay, guys, hurry it up.
- Uncle Jack.

48:17.318 --> 48:18.851
- Up here! Over here!
- What's all that noise?

48:18.853 --> 48:20.586
Over here. Officer down.

48:20.588 --> 48:22.420
Uncle Jack.

48:24.324 --> 48:27.092
Hello? Uncle Jack!

48:30.597 --> 48:33.264
Hey. Hey, hey, Jack.

48:33.266 --> 48:35.400
Jack.

48:35.402 --> 48:37.603
We're gonna
find out who did this to you.

48:37.605 --> 48:39.637
All right?

48:41.641 --> 48:43.508
We're gonna get 'em.

48:43.510 --> 48:46.545
Jack. Hey, Jack.

48:46.547 --> 48:49.115
Jack, come on, man.
Stay with me.

48:49.117 --> 48:50.615
Hey, Jack.

48:55.289 --> 48:57.222
Jack! Jack!

49:08.735 --> 49:12.641
Uncle Jack? Uncle Jack!

49:15.909 --> 49:18.846
Hey, Ash. What's up?

49:20.514 --> 49:23.085
Uh... what?

49:24.552 --> 49:26.454
Hello.

49:28.556 --> 49:30.356
I don't understand.

49:30.358 --> 49:33.358
What do you mean,
you don't understand?

49:33.360 --> 49:35.594
Why are you looking at me crazy?

49:35.596 --> 49:36.762
Is this a joke?

49:36.764 --> 49:39.233
No, it's not a joke.

49:41.235 --> 49:43.269
Why would any of this be a joke?

49:43.271 --> 49:45.670
- Come-come on. Come inside.
- N-No.

49:45.672 --> 49:47.706
Stop.
Explain what's going on.

49:47.708 --> 49:49.175
Explain what?

49:49.177 --> 49:50.575
What?! Yeah. What?

49:50.577 --> 49:53.244
The red "X,"
the "send him to jail."

49:53.246 --> 49:55.613
Why aren't you saying anything?

49:55.615 --> 49:57.449
Say something!

49:57.451 --> 49:59.217
- Ashley. Okay. Ashley.
- What is going on?

49:59.219 --> 50:00.721
- Come inside.
- No. Bye.

50:02.222 --> 50:04.190
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on.

50:04.192 --> 50:06.858
Ashley, h-hold up. Hold up.

50:06.860 --> 50:08.896
Leave me alone!

Come on in.

51:17.931 --> 51:19.898
Got something in the bag
right there for you.

51:19.900 --> 51:22.867
Check it out. Check it out.
Check it out. Check it out.

51:22.869 --> 51:25.271
We may have gone
to a record store,

51:25.273 --> 51:28.706
and I might have seen something
that you might like.

51:28.708 --> 51:30.476
Now, see,
that's their second album,

51:30.478 --> 51:32.543
but... I mean, it may not be
as good as the first one,

51:32.545 --> 51:33.878
but I think it's pretty cool.

51:33.880 --> 51:36.382
"Oh, thank you, Dad.
That's so amazing."

51:36.384 --> 51:37.952
Oh, thank you, baby.

51:42.422 --> 51:44.990
I was playing Mom
a new song I wrote.

51:44.992 --> 51:46.891
Want to come here
and sit down with us

51:46.893 --> 51:48.262
and help us write some lyrics?

51:52.532 --> 51:54.568
You want to sit down and talk?

52:29.536 --> 52:31.472
Okay.

52:41.648 --> 52:43.449
911. What's the location

52:43.451 --> 52:45.320
of your emergency?

52:47.755 --> 52:49.755
Hello?

52:53.760 --> 52:55.927
Hello?

52:55.929 --> 52:57.862
Hi.

52:57.864 --> 53:00.499
Yeah.

53:00.501 --> 53:03.369
Hi.

53:03.371 --> 53:05.070
I-I-I think...

53:05.072 --> 53:09.541
I think... I think
I need the p-police.

53:09.543 --> 53:11.075
<i>Hello, Uncle Jack.</i>

53:22.989 --> 53:25.059
<i>Can you hear me or not?</i>

53:37.036 --> 53:39.871
Hello?

53:39.873 --> 53:42.443
Anybody home?

53:52.152 --> 53:54.121
Oh, God, Garret, what'd you do?

53:56.690 --> 53:57.992
No.

54:04.130 --> 54:06.030
Ash. Ash.

54:06.032 --> 54:07.969
Ashley.

54:09.836 --> 54:12.407
God.

54:30.023 --> 54:31.889
Hey, Jack.

54:31.891 --> 54:33.624
Where did you go?

54:38.164 --> 54:39.900
What is it?

54:42.202 --> 54:45.804
You're not having
a stroke, are you?

54:45.806 --> 54:47.641
What?

54:50.811 --> 54:52.646
My family.

54:55.516 --> 54:56.784
Jack.

55:01.722 --> 55:04.722
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

55:04.724 --> 55:06.557
Oh, no.

55:06.559 --> 55:09.494
They died on a Tuesday...

55:09.496 --> 55:10.931
instead of a Wednesday.

55:14.969 --> 55:16.534
Jack, what is wrong with you?

55:16.536 --> 55:18.070
Huh?

55:18.072 --> 55:20.539
Baseball mitt,
what's-what's that about?

55:21.909 --> 55:23.876
Next stop is Little League.

55:23.878 --> 55:26.778
Howard got pissed because
Cooper forgot his lucky glove.

55:26.780 --> 55:28.546
You're gonna drop me off, right?

55:31.784 --> 55:33.187
Jack!

55:38.291 --> 55:40.559
Jack. Jack.

55:45.833 --> 55:48.800
You want to tell me why in
the hell we have our guns out?

55:48.802 --> 55:50.601
What day is it today?

55:50.603 --> 55:52.804
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wed...
What day of the week is it?

55:52.806 --> 55:54.171
- It's Tuesday!
- Tuesday. Tuesday.

55:54.173 --> 55:55.740
- Shit.
- You gonna tell me what's going on?

55:55.742 --> 55:57.108
What time is it?
What time is it?

55:57.110 --> 55:58.911
Do you even know
what's going on?

55:58.913 --> 56:00.579
The glass on her phone.

56:00.581 --> 56:02.780
When she died before,
it was... it was cracked.

56:02.782 --> 56:04.316
When she died before?

56:04.318 --> 56:06.050
And now the newspaper says
they died on a Tuesday

56:06.052 --> 56:07.818
instead of a Wednesday.
What-what the fuck?

56:07.820 --> 56:09.021
The newspaper said
they died on a Tuesday

56:09.023 --> 56:10.688
- instead of a Wednesday?
- Yeah.

56:10.690 --> 56:14.325
The newspaper changed
the date of their deaths?

56:14.327 --> 56:18.329
Boy, I hate to say it,
but you sound insane, J.

56:31.045 --> 56:33.778
Bobby... we got to go.

56:33.780 --> 56:35.347
We got to go. We got to go.

56:35.349 --> 56:36.815
We got to go.

56:36.817 --> 56:38.816
Hey.

56:38.818 --> 56:41.987
Did someone call 911 and
report Garret for possession?

56:41.989 --> 56:44.021
Yeah, but it was a dud.

56:44.023 --> 56:45.691
How is it
you don't remember that?

56:45.693 --> 56:48.760
Actually... actually, I do.

56:48.762 --> 56:50.028
I do re-remember.

56:50.030 --> 56:51.597
Jack, what is wrong with you?

56:51.599 --> 56:53.365
- Huh?
- The pills.

56:53.367 --> 56:55.601
There were no pills on the bed.

56:55.603 --> 56:56.871
Pills on the bed?

56:59.773 --> 57:01.709
And her bike was out back.

57:03.911 --> 57:07.278
Her backpack.
How'd her backpack get wet?

57:07.280 --> 57:09.014
That's a good question, Jack.

57:09.016 --> 57:10.782
But what I want to know is
why you're asking

57:10.784 --> 57:12.083
all these questions
right here, right now,

57:12.085 --> 57:14.318
just all of a sudden.

57:22.028 --> 57:23.695
It's this nightmare.

57:23.697 --> 57:27.568
Just-just having
a night... nightmare.

59:36.429 --> 59:38.863
Wait! Wait, wait!

59:45.271 --> 59:46.537
Please pick up.

59:49.842 --> 59:51.008
- Ashley.
- Hey, Unc...

59:51.010 --> 59:51.943
Hey, Uncle Jack.

59:51.945 --> 59:53.845
Okay. There's a lot
I need to tell you,

59:53.847 --> 59:55.813
and I know the last time
we talked was super weird,

59:55.815 --> 59:57.516
but I-I didn't know
who else to call, so...

59:57.518 --> 59:59.316
so I-I called 911,
like you said,

59:59.318 --> 01:00:02.554
but then my dad just left,
so I followed him.

01:00:02.556 --> 01:00:05.190
And-and now my dad's
getting beat-beat up.

01:00:05.192 --> 01:00:06.791
And it looks like
they're hurting him

01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:08.126
- really, really bad.
- Okay, just-just wait.

01:00:08.128 --> 01:00:09.528
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, Ash-Ashley.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.095
- Ashley, just-just-just te...
- Yeah.

01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:13.831
just tell me exactly
where you are.

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:16.967
Um, I'm on West Amherst
and the corner of First.

01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:18.970
Okay, get the hell out of there.

01:00:18.972 --> 01:00:21.139
But whatever you do,
do not go home.

01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:23.141
Uncle Jack, there's-there's
people here. There's a car.

01:00:23.143 --> 01:00:25.376
- Hello?
- What people? What car?

01:00:25.378 --> 01:00:28.512
- The white one?
- Th-There-there... Hello?

01:00:28.514 --> 01:00:30.048
A-Ashley!

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.019
Shit.

01:01:01.514 --> 01:01:03.083
Q-one...

01:01:20.434 --> 01:01:21.999
This is Bobby O.

01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:23.434
Leave me a message.

01:01:23.436 --> 01:01:25.170
Bobby, it's Jack.

01:01:25.172 --> 01:01:27.171
<i>I need a report on a car</i>

01:01:27.173 --> 01:01:28.874
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:31.175
<i>It's a Porsche 911.</i>

01:01:31.177 --> 01:01:35.246
<i>California plates, 2SAQ321.</i>

01:01:35.248 --> 01:01:37.317
<i>Call me back.</i>

01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:58.195
Hey!

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:03.103
No. No.

01:03:26.326 --> 01:03:29.063
No. No. No. No.

01:03:55.521 --> 01:03:57.222
- Ashley.
- Uncle Jack, thank God.

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.757
- You okay?
- I am, but no, not really.

01:03:58.759 --> 01:04:00.124
Right after my phone died,

01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:01.525
one of the guys
beating my dad up

01:04:01.527 --> 01:04:02.693
came after me and chased me.

01:04:02.695 --> 01:04:04.396
Okay, where-where are you?

01:04:04.398 --> 01:04:06.363
I'm at the diner where we had
dinner the other night.

01:04:06.365 --> 01:04:08.733
I had to recharge my phone,
and this seemed like

01:04:08.735 --> 01:04:10.434
- it-it was the safest place to be.
- Okay, hang on.

01:04:10.436 --> 01:04:12.269
Hang on. I'm a minute away.

01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:13.570
I'll be right over.

01:04:13.572 --> 01:04:15.507
But before I get there,
we need to focus.

01:04:15.509 --> 01:04:17.275
The guys who beat up your dad,

01:04:17.277 --> 01:04:19.244
was there anything else you saw?

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:21.579
- What about their cars?
- Uh, uh, yeah, uh...

01:04:21.581 --> 01:04:23.081
I thought about that, too.

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.581
There-there was a hat.
Um...

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.316
a yellow one, and...

01:04:26.318 --> 01:04:28.420
I-I had their license plates
written down

01:04:28.422 --> 01:04:30.155
- on a napkin.
- That's great.

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:32.157
- That's great.
- Yeah, but it was in my backpack,

01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:34.224
and I lost my backpack
while I was running away.

01:04:34.226 --> 01:04:35.427
Wait, wait.

01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:37.461
You just say
you lost your backpack?

01:04:37.463 --> 01:04:41.099
Yeah. Wh-Why?

01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:44.605
Ashley, you-you have any i-idea
why your backpack would be wet?

01:04:45.704 --> 01:04:47.704
How do you know that?

01:04:47.706 --> 01:04:49.706
I'll tell you
right after you answer.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:51.543
Okay? I promise.
Just tell me.

01:04:51.545 --> 01:04:54.144
Okay, um,
this man came running after me,

01:04:54.146 --> 01:04:55.345
and I fell in the river.

01:04:55.347 --> 01:04:56.548
Everything falls in the river.

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.083
My backpack, my bike.

01:04:58.085 --> 01:05:00.784
And I-I didn't have time
to get my backpack.

01:05:00.786 --> 01:05:02.722
I didn't have time.

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:05.557
So I just... I ran.

01:05:05.559 --> 01:05:07.559
And I lost my backpack.

01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:09.494
And then I ca... I called you.

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:11.563
Ash.

01:05:11.565 --> 01:05:15.566
Ash, I know I've asked you
to do a lot of weird stuff.

01:05:15.568 --> 01:05:17.367
I know you want me to stop.

01:05:17.369 --> 01:05:19.704
But I do have
one more thing like that

01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:21.305
to ask, and then that's it.

01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:23.307
- Everything will start...
- making sense.

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:26.443
Hello?

01:05:26.445 --> 01:05:27.512
Wh-What's happening?

01:05:34.588 --> 01:05:36.454
By the register,

01:05:36.456 --> 01:05:39.456
you know where there's a bunch
of bubble gum in a... in a jar?

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.392
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:05:42.394 --> 01:05:44.595
I want you to grab a handful.

01:05:44.597 --> 01:05:45.796
All different colors.

01:05:45.798 --> 01:05:48.166
And then tell me
when that's done.

01:05:48.168 --> 01:05:49.833
Uncle Jack,
are you here somewhere?

01:05:49.835 --> 01:05:52.637
The answer to all your questions
is in that jar of bubble gum.

01:05:52.639 --> 01:05:54.572
Just reach in there, and then...

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:56.374
then go to our booth,

01:05:56.376 --> 01:05:58.443
the one we always sit in.

01:05:58.445 --> 01:05:59.380
Okay.

01:06:00.447 --> 01:06:01.445
Okay.

01:06:05.552 --> 01:06:07.684
You with me, Ash?

01:06:07.686 --> 01:06:09.354
Yeah, okay.

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:10.688
Uh, now what?

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:12.856
Okay. So, uh...

01:06:12.858 --> 01:06:14.291
here's what we're gonna do.

01:06:14.293 --> 01:06:17.195
I want you to pick
a piece of gum.

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:18.496
Any color.

01:06:18.498 --> 01:06:20.565
Okay? Now start chewing it.

01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:22.934
Okay.

01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:25.235
And when it's good and goopy,

01:06:25.237 --> 01:06:28.673
um, I want you to stick it
under the table

01:06:28.675 --> 01:06:31.778
real good so it won't fall off.

01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:35.612
All right.

01:06:35.614 --> 01:06:37.750
It's done.

01:06:45.324 --> 01:06:46.724
Huh.

01:06:46.726 --> 01:06:48.896
Red gum.

01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:53.630
You were chewing red gum.

01:06:58.204 --> 01:07:00.271
I-I-I don't under...
I don't...

01:07:00.273 --> 01:07:01.271
I don't understand.

01:07:01.273 --> 01:07:03.208
How-how did you...?

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:05.376
How do I know things
I shouldn't?

01:07:05.378 --> 01:07:08.479
Why did I get you
to paint the red "X"?

01:07:08.481 --> 01:07:13.418
What are we doing
sticking things under the table?

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.885
The fact is,

01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:16.887
believe it or not,

01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:19.423
I'm sitting right here,

01:07:19.425 --> 01:07:22.427
holding a dried-up,
chewed-up piece of red gum

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:25.396
you just stuck under the table.

01:07:25.398 --> 01:07:28.398
But for me, it's two weeks old.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.901
I'm telling you, I'm sitting
in the booth you're sitting at

01:07:30.903 --> 01:07:33.371
two weeks...

01:07:33.373 --> 01:07:35.974
two weeks in the future.

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:45.749
Ash, where'd you go?

01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:47.820
Just-just a second.

01:07:49.422 --> 01:07:50.688
Ash.

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:52.826
Just a second.

01:08:04.804 --> 01:08:07.338
Okay. Look again

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.610
and tell me what you see.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:24.821
You put a red question mark,
written in crayon there,

01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:28.428
with the yellow piece
of bubble gum.

01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:35.767
Ashley...

01:08:35.769 --> 01:08:38.303
I know your backpack was wet,

01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:39.970
because...

01:08:39.971 --> 01:08:42.706
somehow, it ended up...

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:48.845
In your future,

01:08:48.846 --> 01:08:53.817
the one I'm in right now,
it-it ended up...

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:57.357
at a crime scene we've been
investigating, soaked.

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:02.059
A crime that, in your time,
hasn't yet happened.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.760
I'm...

01:09:03.761 --> 01:09:05.962
I'm telling you, unless you do
something about it,

01:09:05.965 --> 01:09:09.000
it's not just your dad
who's gonna die.

01:09:09.002 --> 01:09:12.602
Your mom's gonna die.

01:09:12.604 --> 01:09:14.871
And so are you.

01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:23.880
Wh...

01:09:27.487 --> 01:09:30.420
Which you know because...

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:32.960
you're my time-traveling uncle
from the future?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.067
Yeah.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:45.969
If that's true...

01:09:47.673 --> 01:09:49.072
...how do we die?

01:09:49.073 --> 01:09:51.875
Ashley, that's not important.

01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:53.944
How is it not important?

01:09:53.947 --> 01:09:55.679
Because it's not gonna happen.

01:09:55.681 --> 01:09:58.014
- B-Because you're gonna save yourself.
- How do I die?

01:09:58.016 --> 01:09:59.650
You're gonna erase all this.

01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:00.651
Tell me right now!

01:10:00.653 --> 01:10:01.818
No!

01:10:03.922 --> 01:10:05.790
You're not gonna die.

01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:08.492
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:10:08.494 --> 01:10:11.595
You're gonna get on a bus
or-or a train

01:10:11.597 --> 01:10:14.965
or ride your bike and sleep
o-on a beach if you have to.

01:10:14.967 --> 01:10:16.634
You are gonna live.

01:10:16.636 --> 01:10:18.803
What does it look like
when I die?

01:10:18.805 --> 01:10:21.575
And who did it?

01:10:24.543 --> 01:10:25.876
We don't know that yet.

01:10:25.878 --> 01:10:27.678
We-we don't know that yet.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.045
Okay. Just...

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:31.452
just tell me what you know.

01:10:32.551 --> 01:10:35.852
Just tell me what you know...

01:10:35.854 --> 01:10:38.522
and-and I promise...

01:10:38.524 --> 01:10:41.929
I promise, I'll go
like you said I should.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.030
Please, I can handle it.

01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:48.499
Okay.

01:10:50.569 --> 01:10:52.969
Your bedroom door was kicked in,

01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:54.504
and you...

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.875
...and you...

01:10:58.877 --> 01:11:00.878
and you died right on your bed.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.880
It looked like
maybe you tried to...

01:11:03.882 --> 01:11:06.116
force open your window
to get away,

01:11:06.118 --> 01:11:09.922
but... your new paint
made it stick.

01:11:12.024 --> 01:11:14.692
My new paint made it stick.

01:11:14.694 --> 01:11:16.494
Yeah.

01:11:16.496 --> 01:11:20.697
But as long as you're alive,
you can change this.

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:22.700
Whatever you do,
don't forget that.

01:11:22.702 --> 01:11:24.602
I want you to take that thought

01:11:24.604 --> 01:11:26.102
wherever you go from here on in.

01:11:26.104 --> 01:11:30.842
This chewed-up piece of gum,
you-you can unchew it.

01:11:30.844 --> 01:11:34.448
You can change things, okay?

01:11:39.519 --> 01:11:41.652
You're...

01:11:41.654 --> 01:11:43.991
y-you're here.

01:11:45.591 --> 01:11:47.728
Right here.

01:11:49.796 --> 01:11:53.634
Tell me you understand
and you're about to go.

01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:01.205
Y-Yeah.

01:12:01.207 --> 01:12:02.943
Okay.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.146
I'll go.

01:12:07.646 --> 01:12:09.513
I'll do it.

01:13:18.984 --> 01:13:20.920
Hey.

01:13:22.654 --> 01:13:24.888
I know you can't just
let me in there.

01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:26.891
But I got to get in there.

01:13:26.893 --> 01:13:29.293
So, if I pull my gun
while the cameras are recording

01:13:29.295 --> 01:13:32.265
and point it at you,
would you comply?

01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:35.601
I mean, I don't want to die.

01:14:03.261 --> 01:14:04.794
Oh, no.

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:11.201
Christ.

01:14:11.203 --> 01:14:13.036
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- No, no!

01:14:13.038 --> 01:14:15.171
Please don't.
I'm-I'm fine, okay?

01:14:15.173 --> 01:14:16.773
I've-I've stopped the bleeding.

01:14:16.775 --> 01:14:18.709
- Nobody needs to call an ambulance.
- Holy shit!

01:14:18.711 --> 01:14:20.010
What happened to you?

01:14:20.012 --> 01:14:21.277
Detective?

01:14:23.282 --> 01:14:27.652
You know what, everybody,
just back the hell out of here!

01:14:27.654 --> 01:14:29.653
You heard the man.
Get out. Get out!

01:14:31.724 --> 01:14:33.223
All right.

01:14:33.225 --> 01:14:34.892
Circle of trust.

01:14:34.894 --> 01:14:36.259
Let's hear it.

01:14:36.261 --> 01:14:37.995
My niece's backpack.

01:14:37.997 --> 01:14:40.063
It's here in evidence.

01:14:40.065 --> 01:14:41.732
It was found on the scene.

01:14:41.734 --> 01:14:44.735
But I know for a fact
that she lost it

01:14:44.737 --> 01:14:46.437
- the day that she was killed.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:46.439 --> 01:14:48.976
How in the world
would you know that?

01:14:51.877 --> 01:14:53.009
Jack?

01:14:53.011 --> 01:14:55.111
I can't say.

01:14:55.113 --> 01:14:57.313
All right, well,
what are you suggesting?

01:14:57.315 --> 01:15:01.052
The backpack... that somebody
planted it on the scene?

01:15:01.054 --> 01:15:02.452
What reason in the world

01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:05.356
- would a perp have to do that?
- I don't know.

01:15:05.358 --> 01:15:07.157
Okay? I don't...

01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:09.160
I don't... I don't know.

01:15:09.162 --> 01:15:11.861
I-I think I might.

01:15:11.863 --> 01:15:15.799
The plates you had me call in,
the owner of that vehicle,

01:15:15.801 --> 01:15:17.701
is he the guy
who did this to you?

01:15:17.703 --> 01:15:19.202
All I know is that car

01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:22.973
was parked in the lot
of a building I went inside,

01:15:22.975 --> 01:15:24.974
and some guy comes out,
guns blazing...

01:15:24.976 --> 01:15:26.977
Building where?

01:15:26.979 --> 01:15:29.115
And why were you entering it?

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:32.482
Okay.

01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.718
You know what, Jack?
Forget it.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.120
Don't even bother
to answer that.

01:15:36.122 --> 01:15:37.821
Your homeboy's finished.

01:15:37.823 --> 01:15:39.490
You grab his badge,
his gun, his keys,

01:15:39.492 --> 01:15:41.258
and you escort him home.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.126
Shit.

01:15:43.128 --> 01:15:47.831
The plates he had me call in
belonged to Lee!

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:51.468
Sergeant Roger Lee

01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:54.106
of Internal Affairs.

01:15:55.742 --> 01:15:57.677
What?

01:15:59.145 --> 01:16:01.879
Roger Lee?

01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:05.152
The prick who interviewed me
a couple days ago?

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:10.353
It means that maybe Lee...

01:16:10.355 --> 01:16:11.856
is Georgie.

01:16:11.858 --> 01:16:14.191
I mean, if that's...
if that's true,

01:16:14.193 --> 01:16:17.294
then we have got to go
and brief Eaves.

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:20.063
Now, I'll set it up, but he's
gonna want to hear Jack's story

01:16:20.065 --> 01:16:21.197
straight from
the horse's mouth.

01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:23.200
So let's-let's all reconvene

01:16:23.202 --> 01:16:25.068
on the parking lot
in just one minute.

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:26.870
W-Wait, wait.

01:16:26.872 --> 01:16:29.240
Who's Eaves?

01:16:29.242 --> 01:16:31.912
Meet us outside.

01:17:02.408 --> 01:17:04.208
<i>Hey, you've reached Garret.</i>

01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:06.009
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:07.577
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:10.180
<i>Uh, can you call me back
as soon as you get this?</i>

01:17:10.182 --> 01:17:11.982
<i>Please.
As soon as you can.</i>

01:17:11.984 --> 01:17:13.517
<i>It's important.</i>

01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:18.088
<i>Hey, what's up? It's Susan.</i>

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:19.490
<i>I can't answer the phone
right now.</i>

01:17:19.492 --> 01:17:21.025
<i>Leave a message,</i>

01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:23.059
and I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:25.164
Thanks. Bye.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.447
So, this Georgie
you've been chasing,

01:17:44.449 --> 01:17:46.916
<i>we've both been telling
half-truths,</i>

01:17:46.918 --> 01:17:50.187
<i>because we're under
strict orders to keep it quiet.</i>

01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:53.857
- By who?
- I.A. and the D.A.

01:17:53.859 --> 01:17:56.227
Georgie's a group

01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:59.028
created by a bunch
of dirty cops.

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.031
That sketch I showed you,
it's a fictitious character.

01:18:01.033 --> 01:18:02.165
Doesn't exist.

01:18:02.167 --> 01:18:04.468
So he can never be caught.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.004
<i>It was driving us crazy
for years until Eaves,</i>

01:18:07.006 --> 01:18:09.005
<i>who's running
I.A.'s case on this,</i>

01:18:09.007 --> 01:18:11.575
<i>he told us
we're chasing our own tails.</i>

01:18:11.577 --> 01:18:13.509
The point is,

01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:15.879
you seem to have uncovered
the fact that

01:18:15.881 --> 01:18:19.148
the number two guy in command
of the good guys at I.A.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:22.318
is, in fact,
one of the bad guys.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.955
Speaking of which,
we ought to get going.

01:18:24.957 --> 01:18:27.090
And where exactly are we going?

01:18:27.092 --> 01:18:29.960
Well, unless you want to stop
off at a hospital on the way,

01:18:29.962 --> 01:18:32.263
we've got to go
and download Eaves.

01:18:32.265 --> 01:18:36.133
<i>You're gonna tell him how you
got so tangled up in all this.</i>

01:18:36.135 --> 01:18:38.568
<i>And who knows?
Maybe he can help you find</i>

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.638
<i>whatever the hell it is
you think you're looking for.</i>

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.106
<i>Okay?</i>

01:18:42.108 --> 01:18:43.607
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:18:43.609 --> 01:18:45.111
Jack, come on, man.

01:19:01.927 --> 01:19:04.260
- What's up, Ash?
- Hey, Bobby.

01:19:04.262 --> 01:19:06.930
All right, let me get this.
I got this.

01:19:06.932 --> 01:19:09.333
Thanks for getting here so fast.

01:19:09.335 --> 01:19:12.068
Of course.
You call me, I'm there.

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:15.371
<i>So, exactly
what's going on, huh?</i>

01:19:15.373 --> 01:19:18.075
<i>Like I
said on the phone, I-I...</i>

01:19:18.077 --> 01:19:20.210
<i>I just have a feeling
it would be a good thing</i>

01:19:20.212 --> 01:19:21.611
<i>if you came over.</i>

01:19:21.613 --> 01:19:24.080
<i>Is-is it your dad?</i>

01:19:24.082 --> 01:19:25.616
Is he drinking?

01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:27.284
Is he...

01:19:27.286 --> 01:19:29.018
is he doing drugs again?

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.353
Is he...

01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:32.893
Y-You want to talk about it?

01:19:33.993 --> 01:19:35.992
- No.
- No?

01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:38.128
No.

01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:41.531
It's just good that
you-you came and picked me up.

01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:43.400
Yeah, well...

01:19:43.402 --> 01:19:46.402
well, you know I got you.

01:19:46.404 --> 01:19:48.738
Do you mind
if I charge my phone?

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.473
Hey.

01:19:50.475 --> 01:19:52.978
Help yourself.

01:19:58.083 --> 01:20:01.085
Sir, one thing
you haven't said yet

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:04.754
is how exactly my brother
was involved in all of this.

01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:06.022
Do we know?

01:20:06.024 --> 01:20:07.324
Well, for a few years now...

01:20:07.326 --> 01:20:08.592
well, you probably know this
already...

01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:11.461
your brother reverted back to
his old ways to pay the bills.

01:20:11.463 --> 01:20:14.031
Unfortunately, it got him
caught up in a transaction

01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:16.032
with an out-of-town associate
of Georgie's...

01:20:16.034 --> 01:20:19.068
who had no idea
he was selling evidence

01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:20.573
to the brother of a cop.

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:26.710
Well, you can imagine,
those beans get spilled,

01:20:26.712 --> 01:20:29.713
tightknit group of cops
on the make,

01:20:29.715 --> 01:20:31.382
fragile trust,

01:20:31.384 --> 01:20:33.650
their cover blown
by the ne'er-do-well brother

01:20:33.652 --> 01:20:36.452
of the oh-so-honest
Jack Radcliff,

01:20:36.454 --> 01:20:38.187
people get uptight.

01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:41.527
They start thinking they've got
to shoot their way out.

01:20:54.774 --> 01:20:56.773
So, where does this lead to?

01:20:56.775 --> 01:21:00.443
Into the Olympic Forest on
the backside of Kenneth Hahn.

01:21:00.445 --> 01:21:02.111
You ever been there before?

01:21:03.615 --> 01:21:05.415
Yeah, but...

01:21:05.417 --> 01:21:07.584
not through here.

01:21:07.586 --> 01:21:09.452
You'll like it.

01:21:09.454 --> 01:21:10.457
Nice.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:06.442
Okay, you want to text
your folks

01:22:06.444 --> 01:22:08.648
and let 'em know
that we're here?

01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:27.865
Jack.

01:22:30.668 --> 01:22:32.402
Hey, Bobby. Do me a favor.

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:34.470
Text Eaves.
Tell him we're already here.

01:22:34.472 --> 01:22:35.638
Done.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.241
Beautiful here, isn't it?

01:22:38.243 --> 01:22:39.809
I could have a house right here.

01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:41.512
That's a black
neighborhood right there.

01:22:41.514 --> 01:22:43.914
What,
you don't think I'd fit in?

01:22:43.916 --> 01:22:45.449
Well, yeah, you could pass.

01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:47.317
Just keep passing right on by,
homeboy.

01:22:50.421 --> 01:22:51.722
You know, it's amazing.

01:22:51.724 --> 01:22:54.691
This guy's habitually late.

01:22:54.693 --> 01:22:56.293
Ah, we wait around here anymore,

01:22:56.295 --> 01:22:58.294
we're all gonna get skin cancer.

01:22:58.296 --> 01:22:59.562
At least I might.

01:22:59.564 --> 01:23:02.566
I hate late people.

01:23:04.369 --> 01:23:06.637
Eaves being one
of the worst offenders.

01:23:06.639 --> 01:23:09.572
You know, I take it as a sign
of a man's character.

01:23:09.574 --> 01:23:11.842
And, once, I had to wait for that dude

01:23:11.844 --> 01:23:13.744
for 45 minutes,
and when he showed up,

01:23:13.746 --> 01:23:15.344
I said to him, "Look..."

01:23:15.346 --> 01:23:16.812
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

01:23:16.814 --> 01:23:18.815
Don't you even think
about it, Jack.

01:23:18.817 --> 01:23:21.718
Point that fucking gun
at the ground.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.454
And put it on the hood
of the car right now.

01:23:24.456 --> 01:23:28.759
<i>So, you sure
you don't want to tell me...</i>

01:23:28.761 --> 01:23:32.396
...what we're here for
before we go inside?

01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:34.330
Um...

01:23:34.332 --> 01:23:36.900
truth is, I think
my parents are in

01:23:36.902 --> 01:23:38.701
some kind of serious trouble.

01:23:38.703 --> 01:23:40.736
I was hoping you could come in

01:23:40.738 --> 01:23:42.572
and you could talk
to 'em, maybe?

01:23:42.574 --> 01:23:44.607
Make sure they're okay?

01:23:44.609 --> 01:23:47.410
Yes. I mean, sure.

01:23:47.412 --> 01:23:51.248
I figured you would have
called your Uncle Jack to...

01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:53.717
help you deal
with your folks, but...

01:23:53.719 --> 01:23:55.355
why didn't you?

01:23:57.488 --> 01:23:59.589
Um... I-I don't know.

01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:01.724
I guess I just didn't want to
this time.

01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:05.262
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

01:24:05.264 --> 01:24:07.263
Thanks again for doing this.

01:24:07.265 --> 01:24:09.333
Aw.

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:10.733
Absolutely.

01:24:20.712 --> 01:24:22.548
There you go.

01:24:24.283 --> 01:24:25.982
- Hey, hey. What's up?
- Hey, Bobby.

01:24:25.984 --> 01:24:28.518
- What's going on, man?
- It's all good, man.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.785
- Hey, Mom.
- Ashley, baby,

01:24:29.787 --> 01:24:32.421
why don't you come in the house
and let Daddy and Bobby talk?

01:24:32.423 --> 01:24:34.357
No, actually,
I was hoping we could all

01:24:34.359 --> 01:24:36.259
go inside and talk,
if that's okay.

01:24:36.261 --> 01:24:37.593
I just have a few questions

01:24:37.595 --> 01:24:39.528
I'd like to ask
everybody concerned.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:41.964
Like... how in the world

01:24:41.966 --> 01:24:45.768
did your daughter end up
following you...

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:47.706
to Amherst Street today?

01:24:49.507 --> 01:24:51.275
No, Bobby. No.

01:24:51.277 --> 01:24:52.942
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:24:52.944 --> 01:24:55.312
You run, you scream,

01:24:55.314 --> 01:24:57.984
I will blow your daddy's head
off his neck.

01:24:59.051 --> 01:25:00.717
What's up, Garret?

01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:02.718
Bobby, man, please.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.987
"Bobby, man, please."

01:25:04.989 --> 01:25:06.923
- Let's go, boy.
- Bobby, man.

01:25:06.925 --> 01:25:09.425
Go, baby. Go, go, go. Go inside, baby.

01:25:09.427 --> 01:25:10.893
- Get in there!
- Go!

01:25:10.895 --> 01:25:13.964
- Control your dog. Control that damn dog.
- Wilco!

01:25:13.966 --> 01:25:15.766
- Get in the kitchen, you understand me?
- Wait. Go, go.

01:25:15.768 --> 01:25:18.402
- Go, go, go.
- Take the dog and get in the kitchen.

01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:20.570
Anybody else here?

01:25:20.572 --> 01:25:22.371
No. Nobody's here, man.
Nobody's here, Bobby.

01:25:22.373 --> 01:25:23.973
Nobody's here.

01:25:23.975 --> 01:25:25.976
- Get him out of here!
- Nobody's here.

01:25:25.978 --> 01:25:28.544
- Come on.
- Leave that dog behind the gate.

01:25:28.546 --> 01:25:30.080
- Move! Go. - Okay.
- Go, go. All right.

01:25:30.082 --> 01:25:32.715
- We're-we're going. We're going, Bobby.
- Sit on the sofa!

01:25:32.717 --> 01:25:34.851
- We're going. Okay. We're here. We're here.
- Sit. Sit!

01:25:34.853 --> 01:25:37.454
<i>Now, Jack.</i>

01:25:37.456 --> 01:25:39.522
Put it on the hood of the car!

01:25:40.993 --> 01:25:42.726
Move.

01:25:42.728 --> 01:25:44.093
Over here.

01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:47.800
Back the fuck up.

01:25:50.469 --> 01:25:53.439
You figure out
why Howard is dead yet?

01:25:55.341 --> 01:25:57.977
Because he was clean.

01:26:02.081 --> 01:26:04.348
The backpack, Jack.

01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:06.349
How'd you do that?

01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:07.918
You don't have ESP,

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.856
so how did you know
that your niece lost it?

01:26:12.757 --> 01:26:15.659
Just tell me the truth, and
we can figure out what's next.

01:26:15.661 --> 01:26:17.693
<i>The box under</i>

01:26:17.695 --> 01:26:19.528
the bed, Ashley.

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:22.999
I need to know
how you knew what was in it.

01:26:23.001 --> 01:26:25.634
You don't have X-ray vision,

01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:28.138
so how did you know?

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.005
Huh?

01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:32.041
Just tell me the truth.

01:26:32.043 --> 01:26:33.910
We can figure out what's next.

01:26:33.912 --> 01:26:37.613
Who... did you learn
about her backpack from?

01:26:37.615 --> 01:26:39.549
Who's your witness, Jack?

01:26:41.019 --> 01:26:43.586
You want to know who told me
about her backpack?

01:26:43.588 --> 01:26:46.326
You want to know who
told me about her backpack?

01:26:48.594 --> 01:26:50.593
It was Ashley.

01:26:50.595 --> 01:26:51.928
Ashley?

01:26:51.930 --> 01:26:53.696
Told you about the backpack?

01:26:53.698 --> 01:26:56.165
That's right.

01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:59.068
Ashley's the one
who called you on your phone?

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:01.537
That's right.

01:27:01.539 --> 01:27:03.173
<i>The box,</i>

01:27:03.175 --> 01:27:04.840
- Ashley.
- Hey, we... Look, look,

01:27:04.842 --> 01:27:06.876
why don't you sit
with us, man, and we can....

01:27:06.878 --> 01:27:08.911
we can sit here,
and we can talk about things

01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:10.414
calmly, thinking, okay?

01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:12.415
Okay.

01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:14.483
Since you don't seem
to be realizing

01:27:14.485 --> 01:27:17.187
the gravity of all this!

01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:18.789
No!

01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:20.456
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Get down! Stay down.

01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:22.159
You stupid motherfucker!

01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:23.960
The irony of all this

01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:27.097
is I told your brother, Jack.
I begged him!

01:27:27.099 --> 01:27:29.833
<i>I said, "Get out of town!"</i>

01:27:29.835 --> 01:27:32.436
But the motherfucker thinks
he can talk his way out!

01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:34.137
Look, look, stop, please.
Look, look.

01:27:34.139 --> 01:27:36.138
Look, we can fix this, okay?

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.741
We can fix this.
You're not a killer, man.

01:27:37.743 --> 01:27:39.875
You're not a killer,
no more than me, okay?

01:27:39.877 --> 01:27:41.745
All right, you was just
thinking down the line, right?

01:27:41.747 --> 01:27:43.647
You were thinking about
your kids and-and your family.

01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:45.581
But please, man,
we all make mistakes, right?

01:27:45.583 --> 01:27:47.550
We make mistakes.
We can fix 'em, Bobby.

01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:49.686
- Bobby, listen to me, man!
- Please.

01:27:49.688 --> 01:27:51.921
Please! Please!

01:27:51.923 --> 01:27:54.924
Ashley, your Uncle Bobby
tried to save you.

01:27:54.926 --> 01:27:56.860
Tried to save you all.

01:27:56.862 --> 01:27:59.929
I came to your daddy
and told him what was coming.

01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:02.699
I told him
to get you all out of town.

01:28:02.701 --> 01:28:05.501
And did he do it? No.

01:28:05.503 --> 01:28:08.839
<i>He stays,
which I promised wasn't</i>

01:28:08.841 --> 01:28:11.974
gonna happen, and now they
don't just want to kill him.

01:28:11.976 --> 01:28:15.414
They told me it has to be me.

01:28:17.015 --> 01:28:19.182
See what I'm made of.

01:28:19.184 --> 01:28:21.585
<i>How could you do this, man?</i>

01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:24.220
You had every chance
in the world.

01:28:24.222 --> 01:28:26.889
Why didn't you get your family
out of harm's way?

01:28:26.891 --> 01:28:28.724
- Bobby, man, I'm so sorry.
- Why did you do it?

01:28:28.726 --> 01:28:30.794
I'm so sorry, man,
but we can fix this, man.

01:28:30.796 --> 01:28:33.666
We're family, right?
We're family, Bobby!

01:28:36.734 --> 01:28:39.035
<i>Look, since nobody seems</i>

01:28:39.037 --> 01:28:41.571
<i>to want to tell me the truth,</i>

01:28:41.573 --> 01:28:43.643
<i>you leave me with no choice.</i>

01:28:48.012 --> 01:28:51.013
I need... you to turn around

01:28:51.015 --> 01:28:53.683
and get down
on your knees, Jack.

01:28:53.685 --> 01:28:55.050
I'm not giving you that.

01:28:55.052 --> 01:28:58.153
When I tell you to get down
on the ground,

01:28:58.155 --> 01:29:02.157
get your black ass
on the ground, Jack!

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.860
I'm not giving you that, Bobby.

01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:05.594
I'm not giving you that.

01:29:05.596 --> 01:29:09.799
You're gonna have to look me
in the eye, Bobby.

01:29:21.313 --> 01:29:23.013
You know what?

01:29:31.856 --> 01:29:33.656
No.

01:29:33.658 --> 01:29:35.193
<i>Bobby!</i>

01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:39.262
Daddy!

01:29:39.264 --> 01:29:42.132
- Dad! Daddy!
- Run, baby! Run!

01:29:42.134 --> 01:29:44.834
Run!

01:29:44.836 --> 01:29:47.137
- Run, Ashley! Run, baby! Run!
- Ashley! Ashley!

01:29:47.139 --> 01:29:48.638
Your mom!

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.574
- Run, Ashley!
- I got your mama!

01:29:50.576 --> 01:29:51.875
Run, Ashley!

01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:01.918
No! No!

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.586
No!

01:30:03.588 --> 01:30:04.920
No! No!

01:30:04.922 --> 01:30:06.156
No!

01:30:21.006 --> 01:30:23.339
Ashley!

01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:26.276
Let me in.

01:30:26.278 --> 01:30:27.677
- No! No! No!
- Ashley!

01:30:27.679 --> 01:30:29.012
No! No.

01:30:29.014 --> 01:30:31.348
Ashley! Open the door!

01:30:44.630 --> 01:30:47.397
Jack!

01:32:01.338 --> 01:32:04.210
No. No.

01:32:12.016 --> 01:32:14.353
No! No! No!

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.757
What now? What now?

01:32:19.157 --> 01:32:21.092
What do I do? What do I do?

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.393
Last chance, Jack.

01:32:24.395 --> 01:32:25.928
Your witness.

01:32:27.265 --> 01:32:28.932
Ah-ah-ah.

01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:30.165
Don't you fucking answer it.

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:33.469
- Jack!
- Hey, Ashley!

01:32:33.471 --> 01:32:35.504
Oh, thank God you answered.

01:32:35.506 --> 01:32:38.273
Uncle Jack,
I... I didn't listen to you,

01:32:38.275 --> 01:32:40.110
and I know I should have, but...

01:32:40.112 --> 01:32:41.878
I called Bobby. I didn't...

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.946
- He-he killed everybody.
- No!

01:32:43.948 --> 01:32:45.882
No, he didn't.

01:32:45.884 --> 01:32:47.817
You're alive.

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.519
You're alive, right, Ashley?

01:32:50.521 --> 01:32:52.054
Oh, God!

01:32:52.056 --> 01:32:53.522
Uncle Jack, who's that?

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:55.258
- Oh, God.
- Uncle Jack, are you okay?!

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:57.427
Ashley.

01:32:57.429 --> 01:32:59.094
Listen to me.

01:32:59.096 --> 01:33:01.764
The only way I can be okay

01:33:01.766 --> 01:33:04.901
is if you save yourself.

01:33:04.903 --> 01:33:08.303
And if you save yourself,
you'll save me.

01:33:08.305 --> 01:33:11.907
And if you save me,
I will save you.

01:33:11.909 --> 01:33:13.009
I promise.

01:33:13.011 --> 01:33:14.309
No, no, no, no!

01:33:14.311 --> 01:33:15.879
No, no, no, no! No, no.

01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:20.016
Uncle Jack!
Uncle... Uncle... Uncle Jack!

01:33:20.018 --> 01:33:23.152
God! Oh!

01:33:23.154 --> 01:33:26.955
Please! Uncle Jack!

01:33:30.261 --> 01:33:31.928
Uncle...

01:33:33.564 --> 01:33:35.799
Uncle Jack.

01:34:06.597 --> 01:34:08.263
Help.

01:34:26.016 --> 01:34:28.017
You remember what you said

01:34:28.019 --> 01:34:29.852
at the funeral, Jack?

01:34:29.854 --> 01:34:31.553
Do you remember what you said?

01:34:31.555 --> 01:34:35.058
<i>You said you prayed</i>

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.293
to undo all of this.

01:34:37.295 --> 01:34:39.931
So... so did I.

01:34:53.345 --> 01:34:56.548
Uncle Jack! Uncle Jack!

01:35:06.992 --> 01:35:09.058
Hello?! Uncle Jack!

01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:11.096
No!

01:35:12.663 --> 01:35:14.196
Please, Uncle Jack!

01:35:14.198 --> 01:35:15.932
Please!

01:35:15.934 --> 01:35:18.433
See what you just did
by coming here?!

01:35:18.435 --> 01:35:21.004
Now I have to kill your uncle.

01:35:21.006 --> 01:35:22.604
<i>No! Help!</i>

01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:25.174
Please, Uncle Jack!

01:35:25.176 --> 01:35:28.076
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Bobby!

01:35:28.078 --> 01:35:30.014
Bobby?

01:35:33.518 --> 01:35:36.285
Ashley! Ashley!

01:35:36.287 --> 01:35:39.121
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- Bobby.

01:35:39.123 --> 01:35:40.455
Bobby!

01:35:40.457 --> 01:35:42.157
<i>I don't want you</i>

01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:44.294
to look at me.

01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:47.932
Just look
at something beautiful.

01:36:00.478 --> 01:36:02.411
Save you.

01:36:02.413 --> 01:36:04.115
I'll save you.

01:36:06.384 --> 01:36:08.617
If you save me,

01:36:08.619 --> 01:36:10.055
I'll save you.

01:36:17.228 --> 01:36:19.632
Just look
at something beautiful.

01:36:53.664 --> 01:36:56.699
You're okay. I got you.

01:36:56.701 --> 01:36:58.768
I've got you. Okay. Okay.

01:36:58.770 --> 01:37:00.535
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:37:00.537 --> 01:37:02.237
Come on. Okay.

01:37:02.239 --> 01:37:03.539
Oh, God.

01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:06.041
Okay. Okay.

01:37:06.043 --> 01:37:08.311
Okay, I got you.

01:37:08.313 --> 01:37:12.281
Okay, okay, okay, I got you.

01:37:12.283 --> 01:37:14.219
Okay, okay.
