WEBVTT

01:39.767 --> 01:40.851
I just don't see the point.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.562
Of a library? Come on, Howard.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.773
It's so retro.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.109
All the information you want
you can get over the net.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.192
Books, too.

01:49.235 --> 01:52.154
But what about the experience
of holding the book in your hands?

01:52.238 --> 01:53.739
You can't get that over the net.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.410
Did you hear a scream?

01:57.493 --> 01:58.953
Hey, it's Gotham City.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.496
That's practically our theme song.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.665
And it's the cops' problem, anyway.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.916
Now let's go inside.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.003
Wait. I-I'm hungry.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.504
Max, we just had dinner.

02:08.587 --> 02:12.258
So? If you were a gentleman,
you'd go buy me a beefy burger.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.970
You know, pay me back for all those
sodas and frankos I give you at lunch.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.471
I thought they were a gift.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.307
Enough. I'll go get it.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.975
I'll see you inside.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.942
It's over there.

02:30.026 --> 02:31.068
Oh, boy.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.283
Hey, fella, how you doing?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.744
I bet you're a little scared right now.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.245
There's nothing to be afraid of,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.369
I'm just gonna take you back
to wherever you belong.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.918
Easy, boy, easy.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.259
Fingers!

03:39.387 --> 03:40.513
Fingers?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.765
My kids named him.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.183
That's your gorilla?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.395
It belongs to Gotham University.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.647
We're zoologists there.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.399
We were doing some tests on him.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.608
He went crazy.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.485
To use the technical term.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.113
He ran away. We can't explain it.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.615
- Either of you have a phone?
- I do.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.741
Call the cops.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.344
Have 'em stop the train
at the next platform,

04:02.368 --> 04:05.371
and tell 'em to bring a net.
A really big one.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.178
The cops are searching the park now.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.139
<i>They've got a lot of ground to cover.</i>

04:23.222 --> 04:26.725
The good news is, gorillas don't
normally attack unless provoked.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.477
This one wasn't normal.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.604
Somehow it knew
not to step on the third rail.

04:30.688 --> 04:31.768
And the train it hopped on,

04:31.939 --> 04:34.316
<i>it was the only high-speed one
leaving the station.</i>

04:34.400 --> 04:37.236
Well, gorillas are a lot smarter
than most people realize.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.654
<i>This one was too smart.</i>

04:38.737 --> 04:41.073
You wanna follow it up? Be my guest.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.076
I'll do that. Just as soon as
I go buy someone a beefy burger.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.799
So far, it looks like
a pretty normal zoology lab.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.760
Smells like one, too.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.095
<i>You see any chemicals?</i>

05:03.512 --> 05:04.889
No, <i>Why?</i>

05:04.972 --> 05:05.972
Keep looking.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.793
It's methyl glycose.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.882
I never wanted to
get into this in the first place.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.053
Except you were the one
who was always complaining

05:44.136 --> 05:45.930
that our money was drying up.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.097
Maybe I complained.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.766
But this whole thing was your idea.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.434
You went along with it.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.728
Look, we need to figure out what to do.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.689
Well, first thing,
we have to get rid of the evidence.

05:55.773 --> 05:56.815
I don't blame you.

05:56.899 --> 05:57.942
That stuff's illegal.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.612
It's the catalyst that splicers use

06:01.695 --> 06:04.240
when they wanna play
musical chairs with their DNA.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.700
But you already know that.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.119
You were using it on the gorilla,
weren't you?

06:09.203 --> 06:11.914
We weren't getting anywhere
with our intelligence experiments.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.791
We were going to lose our grant.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.669
So you figured
you'd splice in a little human DNA,

06:16.752 --> 06:18.170
raise his IO a couple of points,

06:18.254 --> 06:20.756
maybe add a few hand signs
to his vocabulary.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.258
It was enhanced DNA.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.426
He went berserk
as soon as we injected him.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.510
We couldn't hold him.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.596
And now we've got
a gorilla on the loose.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.182
One that's real strong and real smart.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.560
Yes, and getting smarter.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.984
And there's <i>still</i> no <i>sign</i>
of the beast <i>which</i> escaped yesterday.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.986
<i>Our next story
also deals with an animal.</i>

06:42.069 --> 06:45.030
<i>But this one's a lot more cuddly.
At least for now.</i>

06:45.114 --> 06:47.366
<i>The Gotham 200
has just announced the acquisition</i>

06:47.449 --> 06:49.368
<i>of a rare white leopard cub.</i>

06:49.451 --> 06:51.036
<i>Abandoned by its mother in Africa,</i>

06:51.120 --> 06:52.997
<i>the baby was found by world-renowned</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:55.874
<i>animal conservationist, James Van Dyle.</i>

07:06.677 --> 07:10.681
<i>Van Dyle, who owns an animal way station
near Gotham, had this to say.</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:14.184
<i>We must do everything we can
to preserve our wildlife.</i>

07:14.268 --> 07:17.521
<i>Because once it's gone,
there's no way to get it back.</i>

07:25.446 --> 07:27.781
Van Der.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.641
After all that searching, here he is
right in the middle of the street.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.347
Terry, if he came out of hiding,
he must have a good reason.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.973
<i>Hope it's not hunger.</i>

07:53.057 --> 07:55.059
Don't worry, they're not meat eaters.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.727
Not the normal ones, anyway.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.860
Why?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.737
You can talk.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.489
The DNA.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.991
Why can't you leave us alone?

08:54.118 --> 08:56.203
What have we ever done to you?

08:56.787 --> 08:59.123
Everybody's panicked down there.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.624
I'm just trying to help.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.428
You wanna put me in a cage again.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.762
Well, yeah.

09:13.846 --> 09:17.850
You're all alike,
you, the doctors, Van Der.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.351
Who's Van Dyle?

09:19.685 --> 09:21.895
- You have a mother?
- Yeah.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.689
I don't.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.399
Because of Van Der.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.812
What about the little ones?

10:03.896 --> 10:05.105
Them, too.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.467
<i>[haven't seen my mother since.</i>

10:35.135 --> 10:37.554
<i>I was sold to the University.</i>

10:37.638 --> 10:40.974
<i>The doctors there
liked to experiment on me.</i>

10:41.433 --> 10:44.228
That's why I'm not
too fond of you humans.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.687
We're not all alike.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.608
If what you say is true,
Van Dyle's a poacher. An outlaw.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.902
He's the one who should be behind bars.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.822
I just want to know
where he sent my mother.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.033
But don't you wanna
stop him, too?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.577
Think of the other gorillas.
The ones he hasn't taken yet.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.957
You'll make him stop doing that?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.041
How?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.709
I'm not sure yet.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.795
But, I've got
a better chance than you do.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.238
You can't even walk down the street
without causing a panic.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.512
Dawn, that's how long you have.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.347
Dawn? But...

11:20.430 --> 11:25.227
If Van Dyle's not behind bars by then,
I go back down there.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.565
And they can panic all they want.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.114
I remember this place.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
My dad took me here when I was a kid.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.829
They're supposed to be
helping orphaned animals.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.055
Kind of makes you cynical, doesn't it?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.138
Terry?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.431
<i>It's okay.</i>

12:02.514 --> 12:04.391
<i>The animals know I'm here.
They can smell me.</i>

12:17.112 --> 12:19.990
Easy now, this will
only hurt for a second.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.551
It's a radio transmitter.
It was under the gorilla's skin.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.513
That's how conservationists
keep track of migration patterns.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.724
Those animals are protected bylaw.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.559
<i>Bet the commissioner
would like to see this.</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:50.312
Bet she would.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.068
- Did you get it out?
- No problem.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.488
What's wrong?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.490
I think we do have a problem.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.760
What do I do with this?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.971
Get rid of it, completely.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.054
What about him?

13:26.390 --> 13:27.390
Him, too.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.743
Looks okay to me.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.911
<i>Mum</i>

13:49.371 --> 13:50.371
What was that?

13:50.414 --> 13:52.082
Don't know, downdraft maybe.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.067
Where to, sir?

14:19.151 --> 14:21.653
The Wildlife Way Station, fast.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.113
Yes, sir.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.994
It must be hot in that costume.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.370
You get used to it.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.626
Still haven't heard from him?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.963
No, and I'm on my way to the airport.
Gotta catch the red-eye.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.590
Better tell him I won't be around.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.341
<i>That could be a problem.</i>

14:43.425 --> 14:45.302
He's been off-link since we last spoke.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.192
104 creds, please.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.904
Hey, what about my creds?

15:49.241 --> 15:51.201
Where'd that gorilla come from?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.328
Get the guns, now!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.978
I thought you were gonna
give me till dawn.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.647
- Lost 'em.
- Not for long.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.612
In there!

16:31.283 --> 16:32.283
Hey!

16:32.492 --> 16:33.785
Over here!

16:51.469 --> 16:53.096
Freeze, police!

16:53.180 --> 16:55.098
I guess we got here just in time.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.101
I'm James Van Der. I own this place.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.437
I know who you are.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.565
I just got a call that said
you were stealing wild animals.

17:03.982 --> 17:07.235
Poaching? Me? That's ridiculous.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.196
I found a migration transmitter.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.698
Van Der took it out
of a gorilla he stole.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.742
You know anything
about these transmitters?

17:14.075 --> 17:16.244
Only that you won't find any here.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.246
Because you've destroyed them all.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.247
Did I?

17:19.331 --> 17:21.208
Your word against mine.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.834
Not entirely.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.380
You're a poacher, all right.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.590
I'm the proof.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.509
Is this a joke?

17:31.593 --> 17:34.763
Back in Africa, you kidnapped me.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.181
My mother, too.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.017
I don't know anything
about this, I swear.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.269
Miserable liar.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.183
Where is my mother?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.520
I probably sold her.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.355
Probably?

18:25.939 --> 18:28.108
I don't know. I-I don't keep track.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.485
She was my mother.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.862
To me, it was just another gorilla.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.663
No!

18:48.586 --> 18:49.879
That's right, kill him.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.674
It's what anybody would do, any human.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.051
Lam not human.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.262
Well, you're sure not a gorilla anymore.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.751
Looks the same.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.127
Quieter, though.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.597
No. No injection.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.141
But this will get rid of your human DNA.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.559
You won't remember what happened.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.688
I want to remember.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.857
I've been given a gift.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.652
I'm strong as a gorilla,
but smart as a human.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.613
I'm going to use it.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.699
- How?
- There'll be more poachers.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.369
There'll always be more.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.455
But now they're going
to have to deal with me.

20:14.589 --> 20:15.965
He knows who we are.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.343
I don't think we need to worry.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.637
He's a kindred spirit
if I've ever seen one.
