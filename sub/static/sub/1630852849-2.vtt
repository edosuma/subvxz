WEBVTT

01:10.278 --> 01:11.488
Asshole.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.823
I'm sorry.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.581
Let's call off our marriage.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.971
Okay.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.182
"Okay"?

01:42.185 --> 01:43.895
Did you just say, "Okay"?

01:45.480 --> 01:48.066
There's nothing else I can say to you.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.568
"Okay"?

01:52.153 --> 01:53.196
"Okay"?

01:54.823 --> 01:55.907
"Okay"?

01:56.699 --> 01:57.700
Hey.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.537
"Okay"?

02:01.746 --> 02:02.747
"Okay"?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.959
How could you do this to me?

02:29.399 --> 02:31.109
I'm sorry, Ha-kyung.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.362
I'm an asshole.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.059
I checked the price and it went up a lot.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.021
I think it's at least doubled.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.817
As you already know, I have no money.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.445
I poured my entire savings
into that apartment.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.367
I don't care.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.579
I know that. My wife said it was okay,

03:24.662 --> 03:26.456
but that was before we got married.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.750
I'm 36 and not getting any younger.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.543
I should at least have some money, right?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.381
But if that's difficult for you,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.342
let's split it. Half and half.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.969
You wish. You're being ridiculous.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.597
You know I'll be staying
at Headquarters, right?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.182
So what?

03:44.265 --> 03:47.101
I really don't want us to be
on bad terms because of this.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.394
I'm serious.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.355
Would you want that? We're colleagues.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.232
Don't you agree?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
Give it some thought and let me know.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.578
Hey, honey.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.791
No, I'm out buying
your favorite snack, macarons.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.585
I should hurry home too.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.300
<i>Make sure to dress warmly this morning.</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:22.303
<i>The temperature in Gangwon Province
has reached sub-zero levels.</i>

04:22.387 --> 04:25.765
<i>And the temperature in
the central region is also below average.</i>

04:25.848 --> 04:28.559
<i>The morning temperature
will be similar to yesterday.</i>

04:28.643 --> 04:31.104
<i>But due to cold wind from the East Sea,</i>

04:31.187 --> 04:33.314
<i>sensible temperature may plummet…</i>

04:42.240 --> 04:45.243
<i>Sensible temperature is
most affected by the wind.</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:50.581
<i>The temperature that people feel differs
depending on the direction of the wind</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:53.793
<i>even if they're in the same space.</i>

04:53.876 --> 04:56.170
Can you turn off the heater, please?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.799
Oh, you must be hot because of the heat.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.810
Can you turn on the heater, please?
It's cold here.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.687
Sorry?

05:15.648 --> 05:16.482
Okay.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.613
<i>Wind.</i>

05:23.364 --> 05:25.116
<i>The wind is always the problem.</i>

05:25.700 --> 05:27.243
I said it's hot.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.622
Okay.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.421
I said it's cold.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.630
Damn it.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.178
Look. Excuse me,

05:45.803 --> 05:49.182
but could you please come to an agreement?

06:09.827 --> 06:16.417
EPISODE 2
SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE

06:24.717 --> 06:26.928
She said your ancestors helped you.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.306
Mom, did you visit that shaman again?

06:30.890 --> 06:31.891
What else did she say?

06:31.974 --> 06:35.728
She said one day, you'll thank him greatly

06:35.812 --> 06:38.856
and say, "Thank you for leaving me."

06:38.940 --> 06:40.358
That's probably how you feel.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.319
You never liked him,

06:43.402 --> 06:46.155
so you're ecstatic
that he left on his own.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.073
Am I wrong?

06:47.156 --> 06:49.367
Ha-kyung, she's just upset.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.661
I can't completely deny that.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.917
Your dad was always chasing rainbows,
and I hated him for that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.502
But he always kept his promises.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.839
-Mom.
-I knew something felt off

07:02.922 --> 07:04.882
the moment I first met him.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.927
How could anyone in their right mind
break off an engagement

07:08.010 --> 07:09.554
a month before the wedding?

07:10.346 --> 07:11.722
And he's so cheap.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.600
I know splitting costs is
a trend these days,

07:14.684 --> 07:17.270
but I never heard
of any bride who pitched in

07:17.353 --> 07:18.855
for her own wedding gifts.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.398
Did you see my credit card bill?

07:21.023 --> 07:22.316
I didn't have to.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.445
We used my card but he paid me back.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.612
Don't make me laugh.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.281
Come on.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.161
Enough with the pity party.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.080
Make sure you clarify
who owns the apartment.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.957
There's no need for that. It's mine.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.377
Make sure you clarify that on paper too,
or he'll pull one over on you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.504
Fine. I'll take care of it.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.966
I said I'll handle it on my own.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.760
He gave that house to her
when they separated

07:49.844 --> 07:51.137
as alimony.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.764
How can we trust him
when he even called off the wedding?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.648

SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE 2°C

09:06.546 --> 09:08.005
What did you say your name was?

09:08.089 --> 09:09.382
Lee Si-woo.

09:10.841 --> 09:14.595
We're not allowed to let you in
if you don't have your security pass.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.472
I am an employee here.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.934
I left both my ID card
and employee card at home.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.646
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

09:25.106 --> 09:28.359

Rain that falls at the right time.</i>

09:28.442 --> 09:29.819
<i>I'm Lee Si-woo.</i>

09:35.866 --> 09:37.577
What's your employee number?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.037
It's 1835081.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.664
Zero, eight, one…

09:47.169 --> 09:48.546
This doesn't look like you.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.172
It's…

09:51.757 --> 09:54.927
That is me. I was chubby
while preparing for the state exam.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.846
But…

09:57.847 --> 09:59.974
-you look very different.
-It is me.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.561
I lost some fat here and here. It's me.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.772
He is an employee.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.318
-Oh, do you know him?
-He's from the Metropolitan Office.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.194
I see.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.865
All right. You may enter.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.160
You should stop by HR
and issue a new pass.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.370
I will. Goodbye.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.708
Hello.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.294
You saved me back there.

10:28.377 --> 10:31.005
-Thank you.
-You can go about your day and leave.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.480
-What is it?
-I'm going about my day.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.483
I've been dispatched here

10:50.566 --> 10:52.276
as a Severe Weather Forecaster
for Chief Team Two.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.070
What did you say?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.614
I'll be working here
for the next two weeks.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.753
-Has it been seven years already?
-Yes.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.837
-Sir.
-Yes?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.631
I… What?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.009
-Hello.
-I'm glad you're here.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.761
Say hello.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.222
You probably heard of Um from Gangneung.

11:21.305 --> 11:24.266
He's the new Senior Forecaster
of Chief Team Two.

11:25.851 --> 11:26.811
Our team?

11:27.561 --> 11:29.188
-Dong-han.
-Yes?

11:29.271 --> 11:32.108
-We look forward to working with you.
-Gosh. Likewise, sir.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.985
I look forward
to working with you, Director Jin.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.283
We need to talk.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.413
Sure.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.458
You told me to think about it.
This is unfair.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.211
You can think about it.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.382
But I should also have
an alternative plan.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.051
Soon, we'll have to prepare
for summer disaster prevention.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.886
If we don't have a director by then,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.930
I can't just appoint anyone.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.349
I need an alternative.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.229
I know you'll accept the offer
to go to Switzerland anyway.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.230
Isn't that why you're here?

12:11.313 --> 12:13.732
I'm here because of
that new forecaster on our team.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.359
Oh, Lee Si-woo?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.362
He's just impossible.

12:18.446 --> 12:22.116
He's reckless and has no respect
for the system--

12:22.199 --> 12:24.785
-I know. He's a bit immature.
-Exactly.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
But he has good intuition.
He has intuitive power.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.831
People like him are practical.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.792
No, sir. I beg to differ.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.627
Please withdraw his dispatch.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.633
What's it to you who joins the team
if you're going to leave anyway?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.427
I never said I was leaving.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.263
Then will you stay?

12:45.931 --> 12:48.851
<i>You know I'll be staying
at Headquarters, right?</i>

12:49.768 --> 12:51.604
I'm not sure yet.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.399
Fine.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.401
You have one week.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.614
You know many people have lined up
to join WMO's program, right?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.824
I need to reply to
the International Cooperation Division.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.826
One week.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.870
Understood.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.747
Okay.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.921
-You were dispatched here?
-Yes.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.797
-For how long?
-Two weeks.

13:19.548 --> 13:20.883
-Hey.
-What?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.552
-Sir.
-Goodness.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.263
What are you doing here?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.473
I was dispatched here.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.143
Then what about you?
You should be at the Gangwon Office.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.354
I was appointed here.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.855
-Goodness.
-Really?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.565
Have you finally become a director?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.526
I'm so happy for you.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.986
-It was long overdue.
-Congratulations.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.364
No, it's not what you think.

13:43.948 --> 13:44.865
Which team?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.410
Team Two.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.537
-What?
-Team Two.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.289
Two?

13:52.873 --> 13:55.167
Is this the Senior Forecaster's desk?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.711
Wait. Hold on.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.839
Are you here as the Senior Forecaster
of Chief Team Two?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.341
Yes. That's right.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.511
So you'll be working
under Director Jin Ha-kyung?

14:05.594 --> 14:06.595
Yes.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.764
Under her.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.188
NEWS
TRENDING SEARCHES

14:35.082 --> 14:36.876
-You've lost so much weight.
-Really?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.127
You've lost a ton.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.131
So how's your marriage life?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.966
Does Deputy Director Han treat you well?

14:44.049 --> 14:45.551
He may seem cold on the outside,

14:45.634 --> 14:47.428
but he's really caring.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.223
He cleans and does everything
around the house.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.227
Gosh. I didn't think he'd be like that.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.147
You're head over heels for him.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.523
Gosh, lucky you.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.649
You're so lucky.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.464
I feel so left out as a single woman.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.799
-I'll get married first.
-Sure.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.134
-Catch my bouquet.
-I will.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.969
Okay. Yu-jin became so much prettier.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.721
I'll get married first.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.182
Sure, you can go first.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.517
So getting married makes you prettier?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.729
Why did I avoid her?

15:38.812 --> 15:41.190
Why? What for?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.277
This is exactly why
you should never date a colleague.

15:45.361 --> 15:49.281
If you don't get married and break up,
you'll only become a laughing stock.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.575
She's in Chief Team Two,
and he's a spokesperson.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.036
They're bound to meet each other
at least once a day.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.746
Just the thought of it is terrible.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.085
Don't you think so?

16:22.773 --> 16:26.193
The Siberian air mass
has nothing to do with this.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.654
Still, the Okhotsk Sea air mass
is not strong enough

16:28.737 --> 16:31.031
to affect the west.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.700
It's the Okhotsk Sea air mass.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.660
The wind is blowing from that direction.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.121
It's possible if it's blowing
from the northwest.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.957
But the sea alone
can't drop the temperature this low.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.626
-Look at this.
-What are they talking about?

16:42.710 --> 16:45.045
About why the temperature
is continuously dropping.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.841
Senior Forecaster Um thinks
it's due to the Siberian air mass,

16:48.924 --> 16:51.802
and Forecaster Lee thinks
it's because of the Okhotsk Sea air mass.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.304
There's nothing we can do.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.849
They're talking
about two opposite air masses.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.143
It's the Siberian air mass.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.645
The Okhotsk Sea air mass
is more plausible.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.274
You might as well drag
the North Pacific air mass into this.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.650
What? Are you kidding me?

17:06.734 --> 17:08.777
That's absurd.
That's a summertime air mass.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.071
It's just as absurd that the temperature

17:11.155 --> 17:12.614
has dropped to 5°C in May.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.783
Still, what you said was just ridiculous.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.870
What I mean is,
we should consider all variables.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.246
Understood?

17:19.997 --> 17:20.998
Understood?

17:37.765 --> 17:40.184
Isn't the atmosphere in here terrifying?

17:40.267 --> 17:42.811
The Siberian air mass,
the Okhotsk Sea air mass,

17:42.895 --> 17:44.730
as well as the North Pacific air mass…

17:45.731 --> 17:47.691
This is the worst weather anomaly.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.985
In a way, this is the end.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.321
Are we getting disbanded?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.864
I'm not sure.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.910
But I think
Director Jin will get replaced soon.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.203
-No way.
-Really?

17:59.995 --> 18:01.038
Or else,

18:01.830 --> 18:04.792
why would they appoint
Senior Forecaster Um to our team?

18:06.293 --> 18:08.420
I heard Director Jin
was going to Switzerland.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.091
-I guess it's true.
-Really? Why all of a sudden?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.968
Deputy Director Han's transfer
was canceled.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.136
Really?

18:17.471 --> 18:18.889
So he'll be staying here?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.392
Gosh. I bet she feels uneasy about that.
Don't you think so?

18:22.476 --> 18:23.602
Of course.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.482
That's why she's going to leave instead.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.776
Why is it always the woman who leaves?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.861
They both work here and he cheated on her.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.198
The world doesn't care
about who's right or wrong.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.409
It's all about who's more brazen.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.248
I don't think it's bad
to just leave it all behind.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.461
Is Director Jin going somewhere?

18:53.173 --> 18:54.258
You don't need to know.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.845
Just do your job
for the next two weeks and leave.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.887
But…

19:01.598 --> 19:04.935
Hello, this is Oh Myung-ju
of Chief Team Two speaking.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.145
Okay.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.764
<i>It's freezing over here.</i>

19:42.848 --> 19:45.017
GANGWON REGIONAL OFFICE
OF METEOROLOGY

19:45.100 --> 19:47.728
Didn't you say the temperature
would rise in the evening?

19:47.811 --> 19:48.937
Yes, sir.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.648
Then what's going on? What's the reason?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.609
Judging by the wind's direction alone,

19:53.692 --> 19:56.236
we could say
the Okhotsk Sea air mass impacted this.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.906
But we've yet to find out
why the temperature dropped.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.908
Really? And the latest
average in sunlight?

20:01.491 --> 20:03.827
It's 73, similar to the average.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.746
Then that's not it either.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.915
-Senior Forecaster Um.
-Yes?

20:07.998 --> 20:11.084
-What's your take on this?
-Maybe the cold air in the northwest

20:11.168 --> 20:14.213
temporarily became stronger.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.050
<i>Like May of 1978?</i>

20:18.634 --> 20:22.721
<i>The phenomenon is similar
to April of 2010 too.</i>

20:22.804 --> 20:26.266
<i>At that time, it was also due
to the cold air from the northwest.</i>

20:26.934 --> 20:28.018
By the way,

20:28.810 --> 20:30.896
what's that over Okhotsk?

20:31.480 --> 20:32.439
We're analyzing it.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.360
Gosh, we're always analyzing.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.073
What do you think?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.408
Feel free to tell me your opinion.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.535
I think it's sea fog

20:45.619 --> 20:48.372
caused by the temperature difference
on the sea surface.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.415
Sea fogs are often spotted in that area.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.340
Any other opinions?

21:01.468 --> 21:05.681
All right. We'll tell the press
that it's only temporary.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.101
How about you go down
and explain the situation?

21:09.184 --> 21:10.227
It's an odd phenomenon.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.650
What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable?

21:19.903 --> 21:22.281
-No, sir. It's okay.
-All right.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.241
I'll go tell them.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.496
-I'll see you guys later.
-Yes, sir.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.332
-Good work.
-Good work.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.379
-Good work.
-Good work.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.392
SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRING
COLD AND HOT TEMPERATURES IN MAY

21:54.771 --> 21:57.566
We believe this odd phenomenon
isn't a simple case

21:57.649 --> 21:59.192
of capricious weather,

21:59.276 --> 22:02.195
but a result of climate change worldwide.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.823
To handle this climate crisis,
we will strengthen

22:04.906 --> 22:06.867
the relationship between the departments

22:06.950 --> 22:09.911
and do our best to protect everyone
from meteorological disasters.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.122
<i>He's good at responding to the press.</i>

22:12.205 --> 22:14.333
So the Administrator
wants to keep him around

22:14.416 --> 22:16.626
because he thinks highly of that.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.587
He's all talk.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.963
Any questions?

22:20.964 --> 22:22.966
I'm Chae Yu-jin from Munmin Daily.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.433
How long will this cold spell last?

22:31.516 --> 22:34.227
The Chief Forecaster
can answer that question.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.779
For now, we believe this is temporary.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.573
We believe it'll be cold
for another one or two days.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.533
Will it get warmer in two days?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.620
We hope so. That's what we predict.

22:53.371 --> 22:56.750
I hope your prediction
will come true this time around.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.461
It's too soon
to pull out our winter clothes.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.763
If you have no more questions,
I will end the briefing.

23:09.846 --> 23:10.889
Thank you.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.978
Yu-jin!

23:17.479 --> 23:19.022
Wait outside for a minute.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.068
Please look into that.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.280
Congratulations, Director Jin.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.412
I heard you were promoted.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.540
Aren't you the youngest person

23:36.623 --> 23:38.375
to become a director?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.127
Good work, Deputy Director Han.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.712
Have you thought about what to do?

23:43.338 --> 23:45.799
What? What do I need to think about?

23:46.716 --> 23:48.218
Come on, Ha-kyung.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.887
It's not your loss
even if we split the money.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.223
Split the money?

23:53.306 --> 23:54.850
You sure love to split.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.396
I wasn't going to say this.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.066
But if you're so precise,
why did you take the TV?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.862
I told you.
I thought I could take whatever I needed.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.532
And come to think of it,
didn't I buy the TV?

24:10.615 --> 24:12.534
Don't you remember asking me to pay half?

24:12.617 --> 24:13.535
Did I?

24:16.621 --> 24:17.539
Right.

24:18.039 --> 24:21.168
Did we use your card
because I maxed out mine?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.503
Exactly. I wired you 1,240,000 won.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.798
We paid in cash, so they installed it
for free and gave us a gift.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.178
Right… I remember now.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.846
Return the TV, induction stove,

24:32.929 --> 24:34.264
and workout equipment.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.766
If you don't,
I won't even consider halving it.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.560
Jin Ha-kyung, are you serious?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.353
Address me formally and lower your voice.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.231
-This is our workplace.
-Hey.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.192
I told you before.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.944
I don't want to argue
with you at work either.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.071
But if you act like this,
I have no choice.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.573
So what? Do you want to fight?

24:51.656 --> 24:52.741
-Do you?
-Do you?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.284
-No, thanks.
-Me neither.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.619
Director Jin,

24:55.702 --> 24:57.454
the Director General is looking for you.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.208
I called you but your phone was off.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.626
Oh…

25:05.003 --> 25:06.463
-Let's go.
-Goodbye.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.649
Wait.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.365
Haven't we met before?

25:33.448 --> 25:35.784
-You and me?
-At my wedding.

25:36.785 --> 25:37.994
It was you, right?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.497
-The bouquet.
-No.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.626
You got the wrong person.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.385
What's wrong?

25:54.469 --> 25:57.264
Isn't he that psycho from our wedding?

25:57.347 --> 26:00.475
No. I think you're mistaken.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.270
Are you sure?

26:03.895 --> 26:05.605
It was definitely not him.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.191
I should get going.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.527
-See you at home.
-Okay.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.166
Where are you going?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.211
I thought the Director General
wanted to see me.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.921
I was making up an excuse.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.798
You seemed to be in a pickle.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.678
-What happened down there--
-Well,

26:36.761 --> 26:38.680
I didn't see anything.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.058
That's scarier than saying you did.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.729
You should get some fresh air.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.105
I'll go in first.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.380
Can we talk downstairs?

27:46.206 --> 27:48.458
-Why are you here?
-It's my workplace.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.003
Why aren't you at the Metropolitan Office?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.546
I was dispatched here.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.965
Must you go this far?

27:56.049 --> 27:58.635
Was humiliating me
at my own wedding not enough?

27:58.718 --> 28:00.261
Why did you follow me here?

28:00.845 --> 28:03.306
I'm not here to see you.
I was sent here for two weeks.

28:03.890 --> 28:04.933
Unbelievable.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.646
Is this okay for you?

28:10.271 --> 28:13.066
What if he sees us together?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.402
He doesn't know.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.825
He doesn't know
that you and I lived together.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.786
And I hope he never will.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.083
NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL SYSTEM

29:16.546 --> 29:21.801
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

29:21.885 --> 29:24.471
-Hello.
-I'll be leaving now.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.016
-Oh, hello.
-Hey.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.309
Hello.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.980
-It's freezing out.
-Hey.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.191
I know.

29:37.108 --> 29:41.070
Look at this.
The temperature keeps dropping.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.282
I don't think this is temporary.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.911
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.913
Hello. Gosh, it's freezing.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.415
Hey!

29:53.500 --> 29:54.501
Gosh.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.252
Dong-han?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.797
-Hey.
-How long has it been?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.466
You saw me on a screen every day.
Don't overreact.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.594
You look much better on the monitor.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.598
-Good work.
-Thank you.

30:09.933 --> 30:10.892
Hey.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.436
Look at this.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.971
How about we have dinner together?

30:48.054 --> 30:50.098
We have two new members now

30:50.181 --> 30:51.558
and you guys should chat too.

30:53.393 --> 30:56.187
I need to check into the place
I'm staying at by 8 p.m.

30:56.813 --> 30:57.814
Maybe next time.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.819
I need to go home too.

31:02.902 --> 31:03.945
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

31:04.028 --> 31:04.904
Goodbye.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.117
See? I told you they'd decline.

31:10.451 --> 31:12.453
Teamwork is crucial for our team.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.998
But the director and forecasters…

31:15.081 --> 31:17.041
They're all quite feisty.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.013
They'll sort themselves out.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.016
Then let's focus on our teamwork.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.767
-Shall we?
-Okay.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.565
-Isn't it tasty?
-Yes, it is.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.112
Who's that?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.573
I'm not expecting anyone right now.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.746
-Who is it?
-It's me. Open up.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.583
It's freezing.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.336
How's it freezing in May?

32:01.878 --> 32:03.922
Why are you here all of a sudden?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.131
I texted you.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.926
I said I'd go to Headquarters
and come home right away.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.845
-You texted me?
-Come on.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.347
Hello.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.349
Hey. You've grown so…

32:19.103 --> 32:20.605
Were you having dinner?

32:21.230 --> 32:23.107
What should I do? We have no rice left.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.235
That's okay. I already had dinner.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.738
Eat up.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.382
You were assigned to Headquarters?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.051
Yes. I sent my belongings by parcel.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.178
They'll probably arrive tomorrow.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.014
How could you just text
about such an important matter?

32:55.098 --> 32:57.725
What's wrong? I've always been like that.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.228
But… Gosh.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.897
You should have told me beforehand.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.691
We have no space for your stuff.

33:05.858 --> 33:09.195
There's not much.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.989
Only two bags.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.740
You're unbelievable.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.686
That's it.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.022
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

33:45.898 --> 33:46.899
Thank you.

33:46.983 --> 33:47.984
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.201
What's all this?

34:01.539 --> 34:03.750
OFFICE OF SPOKESPERSON
HAN KI-JUN

34:03.833 --> 34:05.001
<i>Did you get them?</i>

34:06.002 --> 34:08.337
<i>I took them
since I thought you wouldn't need them.</i>

34:08.963 --> 34:10.381
<i>Check if they're all there.</i>

34:11.132 --> 34:13.718
Why wouldn't I need them?
Are you kidding me?

34:25.563 --> 34:26.439
All right.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.537
NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET

34:41.621 --> 34:43.581
<i>Selling a latest model TV.</i>

34:54.342 --> 34:55.718
<i>Selling a rice cooker.</i>

34:57.053 --> 34:59.013
<i>Selling a speaker that hasn't been opened.</i>

35:00.098 --> 35:02.225
<i>Selling suitcases that haven't been used.</i>

35:20.284 --> 35:23.663
Are we doing it right?
Shouldn't we work up?

35:25.873 --> 35:27.291
Are you okay?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.584
-Let me see.
-Stop.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.961
Stop it.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.296
Gosh! What is this?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.591
Hey, if you don't want to do it,
just say so.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.261
-I give up.
-You're crumpling it.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.304
This was expensive. Move.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.723
What should we do? Gosh.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.809
-Let's eat first.
-No.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.519
Let's eat first.

36:15.423 --> 36:19.218
YOU RECEIVED A MESSAGE

36:25.850 --> 36:27.768
<i>How much is the TV?</i>

36:27.852 --> 36:28.895
<i>It's 800,000 won.</i>

36:29.437 --> 36:31.522
<i>No way. How much did you buy it for?</i>

36:33.357 --> 36:34.984
<i>It was 2,480,000 won.</i>

36:35.067 --> 36:37.028
<i>I used it for less than three months.</i>

36:37.528 --> 36:40.615
<i>-Where did you get it?
-Yongsan Electronics Market.</i>

36:40.698 --> 36:43.326
<i>-Come on. You're a fraud.</i>
-What is he talking about?

36:44.744 --> 36:46.746
Hey, who are you calling a fraud?

36:47.663 --> 36:49.790
<i>That's an overseas shipping serial number.</i>

36:50.666 --> 36:51.500
Overseas?

36:51.584 --> 36:52.960
<i>Overseas shipping?</i>

37:08.768 --> 37:12.271
$1,044 = 1,221,480 WON

37:12.355 --> 37:13.439
Didn't I buy the TV?

37:13.522 --> 37:15.233
Don't you remember asking me to pay half?

37:15.316 --> 37:18.402
-Did I?
-Exactly. I wired you 1,240,000 won.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.154
AMOUNT I WIRED = 1,240,000 WON

37:20.238 --> 37:22.114
-It's a million--
<i>-You should be smart</i>

37:22.198 --> 37:24.033
<i>if you want to scam others.</i>

37:25.076 --> 37:27.328
Han Ki-jun, you asshole…

37:44.095 --> 37:46.722
INNOVATIVE WEATHER SERVICES
A STEPPING STONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY

38:05.241 --> 38:06.784
It's not this one either.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.920
You're here early.

38:19.046 --> 38:22.091
-Why are you here at this hour?
-I often come to work at this hour.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.680
Gosh, Headquarters sure is different.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.890
The archive here is huge.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.938
You can't finish this
before our morning meeting.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.484
I'll read these.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.447
You don't need to do this.
You're only dispatched here.

38:45.364 --> 38:49.243
Actually, it's not the Director General
who asked me to come here.

38:49.869 --> 38:50.786
Then?

38:50.870 --> 38:53.706
I was curious about how you were doing.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.958
What do you mean?

38:56.542 --> 38:58.002
After calling off the wedding,

38:58.085 --> 39:01.005
you do know that you guys
were the talk of the town, right?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.716
That's when I found out

39:03.799 --> 39:06.594
that Han Ki-jun was the one
who stole my girlfriend

39:06.677 --> 39:09.013
and that the woman
who was supposed to marry him

39:09.764 --> 39:11.515
was you.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.063
This is why
you shouldn't date a colleague.

39:18.564 --> 39:22.318
I bet even dogs around here know
who I dated and what happened between us.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.863
How was it to see them in person?

39:26.697 --> 39:28.699
It wasn't that bad.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.327
-Who? Ki-jun?
-Me.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.958
I thought it'd break my heart.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.627
But strangely, I was okay.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.255
Once I accepted the fact
that he was the man she fell for,

39:43.839 --> 39:45.049
I felt at ease.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.385
He really is a loser.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.804
That's a fact.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.515
That enrages me even more.

39:52.598 --> 39:55.059
I was dumped by a loser.

39:59.271 --> 40:02.608
Are you going to take up on the offer
and go to Switzerland?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.319
How did you know?

40:06.028 --> 40:08.989
Everyone already knows that you're going.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.077
But personally, I hope you don't go.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.290
And if it's to avoid them,
then you really shouldn't.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.926
I don't think that's any of your concern.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.053
Like the wind,

40:31.679 --> 40:35.266
an affair is invisible
but it always leaves a trace.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.102
No matter how big or small.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.459
It's nice and sunny.

41:09.925 --> 41:10.968
What are you doing?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.096
Don't you smell that?

41:15.681 --> 41:17.641
I definitely smell ice.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.228
You smell ice?

41:22.771 --> 41:24.231
During the previous cold wave,

41:24.315 --> 41:26.942
the only place that had it
worse than Korea was Siberia.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.653
Right. Their ocean was completely frozen.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.946
What do you think happened

41:31.989 --> 41:33.199
to all that ice?

41:39.580 --> 41:40.748
Let's find out.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.428
NAMDAEMUN, SEOUL

41:54.512 --> 41:57.515
SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE 0°C

41:58.474 --> 42:00.726
The cold air from
the Okhotsk Sea and Sakhalin

42:00.809 --> 42:02.811
are flowing toward the east.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.606
After observing it this morning,

42:05.689 --> 42:08.067
we found out that the Okhotsk Sea

42:08.150 --> 42:10.402
that was frozen last winter
hadn't thawed yet

42:10.486 --> 42:13.155
and thus sent more cold air to the north.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.909
What? Are you saying
those were all blocks of ice?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.285
Correct, sir.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.798
It wasn't sea fog.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.883
So the ice hadn't thawed yet?

42:34.426 --> 42:35.886
Goodness.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.143
No wonder.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.854
What's the water temperature there?

42:45.938 --> 42:48.148
The Kamchatka Peninsula is 5°C to 8°C,

42:48.232 --> 42:50.568
and Sakhalin is 3°C to 7°C.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.778
This is truly unprecedented.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.780
What do you think we should do?

42:54.863 --> 42:57.157
We'll have to record this
as the most unprecedented

42:57.241 --> 42:59.910
and lowest temperature
in the weather observation for May.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.621
We predict the weather
in Taebaek and Bonghwa

43:02.705 --> 43:06.458
to go down as much as
0.5°C and 1.2°C respectively.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.544
The most unprecedented and lowest.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.088
-Let's do that.
-Yes, sir.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.214
Not bad.

43:12.298 --> 43:16.260
All right then.
Let's find out how long it'll last.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.344
Yes, sir.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.391
Are you having lunch?

43:23.017 --> 43:25.227
-What if I am?
-Then I'll tag along.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.022
Mr. Lee.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.774
Cafeteria or outside?

43:31.650 --> 43:34.528
-How did you do it?
-Sorry?

43:35.904 --> 43:38.449
The smell. You smelled ice.

43:38.532 --> 43:40.451
How did you smell the ice

43:40.534 --> 43:41.869
from the Okhotsk Sea?

43:41.952 --> 43:43.495
How is that possible?

43:47.082 --> 43:48.709
I'm not a dog.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.085
How could I have smelled it?

43:50.169 --> 43:52.880
I doubt there's any dog
that can smell that.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.549
Then what was that this morning?

43:56.425 --> 43:58.761
I found out after seeing some data.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.579
You're here early.

45:49.872 --> 45:51.248
Why are you here at this hour?

45:51.874 --> 45:53.876
I often come to work at this hour.

45:58.046 --> 45:59.673
You're more naive than I thought.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.092
-Hey, Tae-kyung.
<i>-Ha-kyung.</i>

46:02.176 --> 46:04.636
<i>-I thought the apartment was yours.</i>
-It is. Why?

46:04.720 --> 46:07.222
You received a certification of contents.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.099
What? What did you say?

46:09.975 --> 46:12.060
How could he be so brazen?

46:12.144 --> 46:13.604
How dare he demand half!

46:16.648 --> 46:18.650
Mom is seeing red right now.

46:18.734 --> 46:21.862
She wanted to go there this instant
and grab him by the collar.

46:21.945 --> 46:25.657
I told her that you'd be too mortified
to go to work and managed to dissuade her.

46:27.409 --> 46:29.369
Hello?

46:29.453 --> 46:32.039
Hey, Ha-kyung. Darn it.

46:44.218 --> 46:45.177
Han Ki-jun!

46:46.512 --> 46:47.721
Come out.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.896
She's calling for you.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.784
What do you think you're doing?

47:11.495 --> 47:13.372
Hey, don't forget where we are.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.624
So you're worried about others?

47:15.707 --> 47:17.668
Then you shouldn't have done it.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.002
What did I do?

47:19.086 --> 47:20.837
A certification of contents?

47:21.421 --> 47:23.048
How dare you?

47:23.131 --> 47:24.800
Did you forget what you did to me?

47:24.883 --> 47:27.135
That has nothing to do with the apartment.

47:28.303 --> 47:29.972
Are you even sorry for what you did?

47:30.639 --> 47:31.932
I already apologized.

47:32.015 --> 47:33.433
How many times must I say it?

47:33.517 --> 47:34.560
Once.

47:35.852 --> 47:38.188
You apologized just once.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.856
In any case, I did apologize.

47:43.151 --> 47:47.030
Hey. We spent ten years together.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.156
Ten years.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.409
And you're the one who ruined everything.

47:51.285 --> 47:54.413
Fine. As you said, let's say
you couldn't help falling for her.

47:54.913 --> 47:58.333
But you should have at least
apologized sincerely when we broke up.

47:59.084 --> 48:01.545
You said the apartment
was alimony, not me.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.591
Why? Because you wanted
to hurry and end things. Am I wrong?

48:08.051 --> 48:09.094
But still,

48:09.720 --> 48:12.973
I thought I was also to blame
for what had happened.

48:13.056 --> 48:16.310
I was too busy and irritable
that I was cold toward you.

48:16.393 --> 48:19.605
And I was a fool
who didn't notice how lonely you were.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.231
So yes, I thought I played a part.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.025
And you dare to come after me like this?

48:23.108 --> 48:24.192
What did you say?

48:25.319 --> 48:28.071
You're right.
We were together for ten years.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.867
Should I tell you how tough
and exhausting those years were for me?

48:31.950 --> 48:34.369
You looked down on me
because you had a higher position.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.579
You'd always say,

48:35.662 --> 48:37.914
"Deputy Director Han, some water.
Some coffee, please."

48:37.998 --> 48:39.124
"Get me some sweets."

48:39.207 --> 48:41.376
You expected me
to be at your beck and call.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.170
And those wallpapers.

48:43.253 --> 48:44.921
We could have just hired someone

48:45.005 --> 48:48.425
but you wanted us to do it
and made me work on my day off.

48:48.508 --> 48:50.177
And what happened?

48:50.260 --> 48:52.137
They suddenly needed you at work,

48:52.220 --> 48:53.805
so I had to do it all by myself…

48:54.890 --> 48:55.974
Hey.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.477
Do you know how exhausting that was?

48:59.186 --> 49:01.063
Then you should have told me so.

49:01.146 --> 49:02.105
What if I did?

49:02.606 --> 49:04.232
You would have sulked over it.

49:05.567 --> 49:08.570
Thinking back on
how I curried favor with you every time

49:08.654 --> 49:10.405
still gives me goosebumps.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.948
Do you even know that?

49:17.371 --> 49:18.955
Did all those years

49:19.915 --> 49:22.209
mean nothing to us?

49:23.210 --> 49:24.419
I don't want to hear it.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.963
Tell me how much you'll give me.

49:27.589 --> 49:29.091
Having dated for ten years,

49:29.174 --> 49:32.052
don't you think
it's selfish of you to take it all?

49:36.181 --> 49:37.557
I already sold the apartment.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.269
You sold it? When?

49:41.353 --> 49:43.980
I already got the deposit, and the rest
will be paid at the end of the month.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.191
Then how much do I get?

49:46.858 --> 49:49.653
Out of the 20 million-won savings,
you deposited 5 million.

49:49.736 --> 49:51.279
I paid the rest.

49:51.363 --> 49:55.033
And I paid the deposit,
intermediate payment, and the loan.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.203
Then what does that mean?

49:58.286 --> 50:01.164
Your share of the house
is only seven percent.

50:02.332 --> 50:05.043
After deducting the money you scammed me

50:05.127 --> 50:08.672
after purchasing the TV overseas,
I'll wire you the rest.

50:08.755 --> 50:10.257
So Ha-kyung--

50:10.340 --> 50:14.803
Let's halve it? Don't be ridiculous.
You can't get any more brazen than that.

50:15.887 --> 50:18.515
But you're going to Switzerland anyway.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.392
That means you don't need that house.

50:20.475 --> 50:22.102
Who said I was going?

50:22.185 --> 50:23.729
Everyone did.

50:23.812 --> 50:25.230
Are you not going?

50:25.897 --> 50:28.358
I just became a director.
I'm not going anywhere.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.694
Are you not uncomfortable
seeing me like this?

50:30.777 --> 50:32.529
Oh, are you?

50:32.612 --> 50:34.364
Then you should leave instead.

50:34.448 --> 50:37.159
Be my guest and go to Geneva, you asshole.

50:39.619 --> 50:41.037
-I agree.
-That was refreshing.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.831
I admire her.

50:42.914 --> 50:44.708
A certification of contents? Seriously?

50:44.791 --> 50:45.917
He's unbelievable.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.502
-Seriously.
-He's so brazen.

50:47.586 --> 50:49.546
You better not talk to me ever again.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.797
Got that?

50:57.596 --> 50:59.097
The show's over.

51:00.056 --> 51:01.016
Let's go.

51:07.606 --> 51:08.857
I'll decline the offer.

51:10.358 --> 51:12.402
Seriously? Do you mean that?

51:13.028 --> 51:15.363
Yes. I'll do my best
to lead Chief Team Two.

51:17.449 --> 51:19.618
-Let's have a get-together today.
-No, I'm going home.

51:19.701 --> 51:21.995
I'll go by the rules.
I'm clocking out right away.

51:50.649 --> 51:51.483
Director Jin.

51:52.984 --> 51:55.278
-What is it?
-Care for a drink?

51:57.572 --> 52:00.075
I know a perfect place to go
in this situation.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.922
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

52:20.554 --> 52:21.471
Cheers.

52:25.684 --> 52:29.354
I rarely drink with others.

52:31.439 --> 52:32.357
Why?

52:34.192 --> 52:36.945
I know. You met him
over some drinks, didn't you?

52:37.696 --> 52:39.322
Gosh. What do you take me for?

52:39.406 --> 52:41.491
We dated back in university.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.869
Then we both started working here.

52:44.536 --> 52:46.329
My senior colleagues told me

52:46.872 --> 52:49.082
that I shouldn't date a colleague.

52:49.666 --> 52:52.043
So we agreed to keep it a secret.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.337
But during our welcoming party,

52:54.421 --> 52:57.883
I got drunk and told everyone

52:58.800 --> 53:00.343
that he was mine.

53:01.970 --> 53:04.389
-What about you?
-What?

53:04.472 --> 53:05.932
What was that bouquet about?

53:09.519 --> 53:10.562
Oh, that.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.232
One last photo.

53:14.316 --> 53:15.817
Give me a big smile.

53:15.901 --> 53:19.654
Okay. One, two, three.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.033
Who's catching the bouquet?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.516
<i>I ran away just like that.</i>

53:49.267 --> 53:50.352
That's insane.

53:50.936 --> 53:52.896
There are men who steal girlfriends.

53:52.979 --> 53:54.314
That was nothing.

53:55.065 --> 53:58.026
You're a lunatic. I have to drink to this.

53:58.693 --> 53:59.778
Cheers!

54:06.451 --> 54:08.954
I really liked Yu-jin.

54:09.913 --> 54:10.997
But…

54:11.498 --> 54:14.000
after the mess I caused,

54:14.584 --> 54:16.044
I felt pretty relieved.

54:18.672 --> 54:20.340
But you know what?

54:20.423 --> 54:23.510
She's all thumbs.

54:23.593 --> 54:24.970
All thumbs?

54:25.053 --> 54:26.805
She picks the most terrible things.

54:26.888 --> 54:27.973
Did you not know that?

54:28.056 --> 54:31.184
Perhaps, that could be the reason

54:31.267 --> 54:32.519
why she picked him.

54:33.144 --> 54:34.354
That makes sense.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.399
He acts like a total baby.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.442
If he gets sick,

54:39.526 --> 54:42.779
he wants the entire world to know.
She'll have a tough time.

54:44.155 --> 54:45.490
I have a high pain tolerance.

54:45.573 --> 54:47.075
He's terrible with directions.

54:47.158 --> 54:49.744
And it took him five tries
to get his driver's license.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.079
I got it on the first try.

54:51.162 --> 54:53.373
Really? Here.

54:53.456 --> 54:54.916
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

54:58.545 --> 55:00.463
And he cares a ton about his appearance.

55:00.547 --> 55:02.882
It takes him ages to dress,
so he's always late.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.384
He's afraid of insects

55:04.467 --> 55:05.760
and can't eat spicy food.

55:06.302 --> 55:08.763
On top of that, he's so cheap.

55:08.847 --> 55:11.766
You heard how he asked me
for money, right?

55:22.277 --> 55:25.321
Then why did you want to marry him?

55:28.408 --> 55:29.617
Well…

55:31.494 --> 55:32.787
I'm not sure.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.209
I didn't mind those things.

55:39.711 --> 55:43.256
I didn't mind how he acted
like a baby when he was sick.

55:45.258 --> 55:48.511
And his stinginess made him seem cautious,

55:49.137 --> 55:50.597
so I liked it.

55:53.308 --> 55:54.476
But most of all,

55:55.351 --> 55:58.229
I thought he was proud of me.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.736
I was just a fool.

56:12.243 --> 56:14.621
But I'm glad I finally know now.

56:15.538 --> 56:17.957
-Know what?
-Wind.

56:18.666 --> 56:20.210
-Sorry?
-You said

56:20.293 --> 56:22.087
it always leaves a trace. Big or small.

56:23.671 --> 56:26.341
After realizing that
I was the one who got hurt,

56:27.300 --> 56:30.220
I finally know how to treat him now.

56:32.972 --> 56:34.349
It's all thanks to you.

56:37.977 --> 56:39.437
My pleasure.

56:46.653 --> 56:48.154
Isn't it hot today?

56:49.239 --> 56:50.490
You're right.

56:50.990 --> 56:52.826
It's a bit hot.

56:53.576 --> 56:56.162
Excuse me.
Are you sure you're both feeling hot?

56:56.246 --> 56:57.247
Yes.

57:03.878 --> 57:06.297
-Would you like another bottle?
-I'd love that.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.049
Sir, can we get one more?

57:08.133 --> 57:09.175
Sure.

57:11.386 --> 57:14.597
I'm never going to date
a colleague ever again.

57:14.681 --> 57:17.392
Come on. You never know.

57:17.934 --> 57:22.564
I do. I will never date
another colleague ever again.

57:23.815 --> 57:25.525
-Come on.
-Here you go.

57:25.608 --> 57:26.985
-Thank you.
-No problem.

57:32.323 --> 57:34.367
Are you sure you didn't spot that ice?

57:34.951 --> 57:36.995
It still looks like sea fog to me.

57:38.204 --> 57:41.708
Director Jin and Si-woo
found it themselves.

57:41.791 --> 57:43.042
Goodness.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.796
People like you seem cold
but are actually warmhearted.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.756
Please focus.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.009
Darn it. I didn't see that. Hold on.

57:52.010 --> 57:54.262
I missed that. Darn it.

57:57.056 --> 57:58.975
What is it? Why are you so happy?

57:59.601 --> 58:00.643
What?

58:01.186 --> 58:04.689
It's not much.
Director Jin decided to stay.

58:05.648 --> 58:08.902
She said she'll do her best
to lead Chief Team Two.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.696
I see.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.990
I'm sorry.

58:14.574 --> 58:18.703
I'm afraid it'll take some time
for you to become a director.

58:18.786 --> 58:23.166
I told you this many times already,
but I'm not here for that position.

58:25.585 --> 58:27.212
Things will get a bit noisy, right?

58:35.053 --> 58:37.388
Darn it. Whatever.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.228
Are you up?

59:57.176 --> 59:58.386
Sorry.

59:59.887 --> 1:00:00.722
What?

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:05.059
First, I'd like to sincerely apologize
for what happened.

1:00:07.103 --> 1:00:10.023
I thought we both agreed on it.

1:00:13.026 --> 1:00:15.570
And it was nice.

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:19.991
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1:00:20.575 --> 1:00:23.036
Hey, Timely Rain.
You were quite cool today.

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:25.246
Really?

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:28.416
Then can I kiss you because I was cool?

1:00:31.961 --> 1:00:34.589
-What?
-Here I go then.

1:01:31.854 --> 1:01:33.856
Right. We're adults, right?

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:34.941
Yes.

1:01:36.734 --> 1:01:38.319
What happened last night

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:41.030
was just an incident.

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:43.282
It was something
that shouldn't have happened.

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:45.493
Like a natural disaster.

1:01:45.576 --> 1:01:48.538
Two air currents that shouldn't have met.

1:01:48.621 --> 1:01:51.165
Like lightning, if you will.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.291
So?

1:01:53.292 --> 1:01:55.086
What I'm saying is…

1:02:00.341 --> 1:02:01.718
Let's just forget it happened.

1:02:01.801 --> 1:02:03.886
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

1:02:06.597 --> 1:02:10.727
After all, you'll be returning to
the Metropolitan Office next week.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:13.312
And I'll be managing Chief Team Two

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:15.481
and focusing solely on my work.

1:02:15.565 --> 1:02:17.900
I don't have time for anything else.

1:02:17.984 --> 1:02:19.485
And dating a colleague…

1:02:19.569 --> 1:02:21.904
You know how I feel about that.
Do you understand?

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:23.281
Of course, I do.

1:02:25.408 --> 1:02:27.577
Okay. I'm glad you understand.

1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:28.703
Right.

1:02:29.203 --> 1:02:30.705
-Thanks.
-Sure.

1:02:35.543 --> 1:02:36.711
Okay, then.

1:02:38.504 --> 1:02:39.922
But…

1:02:41.215 --> 1:02:42.300
I'm not going back.

1:02:45.303 --> 1:02:46.262
What?

1:02:46.345 --> 1:02:48.639
Actually, I've been appointed

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:52.769
to Chief Team Two of Headquarters
starting next week.

1:02:56.856 --> 1:02:57.899
What do you mean?

1:02:58.483 --> 1:03:00.443
We'll be on the same team.

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:11.037
I hope we get along.

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:14.248
Let's be mature. Let's be cool about it.

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:17.418
Okay, then.

1:03:41.317 --> 1:03:42.944
This is crazy.

1:04:11.055 --> 1:04:13.766
Where is Director Jin? Is she always late?

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:16.102
I'm sorry.

1:04:16.185 --> 1:04:17.436
Satellite center…

1:04:18.187 --> 1:04:21.482
<i>Please lift the fishing ban!
What are you doing?</i>

1:04:21.566 --> 1:04:23.651
We'll do our best.

1:04:23.734 --> 1:04:25.444
When there's severe weather,

1:04:25.528 --> 1:04:28.406
an accident leads straight to casualties.
Don't you know that?

1:04:28.489 --> 1:04:30.449
You're withholding it on purpose

1:04:30.533 --> 1:04:32.493
because of your personal feelings.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:36.330
<i>Don't worry. I won't ask you out
just because we slept together once.</i>

1:04:36.414 --> 1:04:38.082
-This place is nice.
<i>-They're coming this way.</i>

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.501
-Oh, no.
<i>-Do we have something</i>

1:04:40.585 --> 1:04:42.044
<i>to hide from the others?</i>

1:04:43.379 --> 1:04:44.881
That's a bit too close.

1:04:44.964 --> 1:04:46.757
Do you have feelings for me?

1:04:47.675 --> 1:04:52.346
