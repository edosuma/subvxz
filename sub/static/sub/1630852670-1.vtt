WEBVTT

01:05.807 --> 01:06.474
Ugh.

01:26.194 --> 01:27.829
I didn't hear you get up.

01:34.301 --> 01:36.071
I'll make some coffee.

02:35.831 --> 02:36.731
Fuck.

03:08.429 --> 03:10.165
Live in the present.

03:10.265 --> 03:11.833
Life is a great adventure.

03:15.436 --> 03:16.905
- Hm.
- What?

03:17.005 --> 03:17.906
Fortune cookie.

03:19.007 --> 03:20.308
Cute.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.982
Why are we staying here?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.683
We're living the adventure.

03:31.452 --> 03:35.924
Can this adventure be
a, a little less stained?

03:37.625 --> 03:38.860
This is all that was vacant.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.029
I thought you didn't
want it all mapped out.

03:42.230 --> 03:43.664
Yeah, I know.

03:45.599 --> 03:47.668
But at our next stop could we

03:47.769 --> 03:49.637
at least eat at the restaurant?

03:51.740 --> 03:52.673
Are we gonna stay cooped up in

03:52.774 --> 03:54.876
crappy motels rooms all the way there?

03:56.577 --> 03:58.412
That wasn't the point of all this.

04:00.581 --> 04:04.319
It's 10 o'clock at
night on our first night.

04:05.619 --> 04:07.655
And look, Game of Thrones is on.

04:07.756 --> 04:09.057
At least we have HBO.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.536
Hey.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.678
We'll have our adventure, I promise.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.819
Oh, I saw a pamphlet at the check-in Desk.

04:37.919 --> 04:39.421
The world's largest ball of twine,

04:39.520 --> 04:40.689
it's just off the interstate.

04:40.789 --> 04:42.757
We could hit it up before lunchtime.

04:44.525 --> 04:46.027
Why do you have to tease?

04:46.962 --> 04:51.399
Relax love, it's just the beginning.

05:01.642 --> 05:03.678
- We're really doing this?
- Yeah.

05:23.231 --> 05:25.666
Tell me again when we're
going to do in Denver.

05:25.767 --> 05:29.904
You just can't get away from
planning anything, can you?

05:31.505 --> 05:32.807
Butt head.

05:34.575 --> 05:37.178
I assume we'd find
a place and settle in.

05:38.645 --> 05:40.148
There's some awesome condos overlooking

05:40.248 --> 05:43.584
the west side of the city,
the foot of the Rockies.

05:45.020 --> 05:47.521
I've never seen the Rockies before.

05:50.025 --> 05:51.026
Let's go up 'em.

05:52.626 --> 05:55.697
- Isn't it cold?
- Yeah, it can be.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.268
Cold won't get you.

06:16.317 --> 06:17.919
That sky, though?

06:19.287 --> 06:20.587
What about it?

06:32.367 --> 06:34.502
It's heaven's porch.

06:34.601 --> 06:37.872
The colors, the light.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.277
You'd think nothing so
beautiful could be so real.

06:43.678 --> 06:46.081
But it is, isn't it?

08:22.143 --> 08:23.044
C'mon.

09:27.809 --> 09:28.910
Trent.

09:30.378 --> 09:31.446
Hey.

09:31.546 --> 09:32.847
I've got a headache.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.349
I'm just looking for the keys.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.084
Is there any Advil in the car?

09:37.085 --> 09:39.821
Yeah, Center console.

09:41.823 --> 09:44.192
Hurry up, come back to bed.

09:45.526 --> 09:47.228
Yeah, yeah, okay.

10:10.351 --> 10:11.552
What the fuck?

10:12.787 --> 10:13.888
No.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.564
Mm-mm.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.558
What the hell are you doing?

12:00.294 --> 12:02.163
- Trent.
- Get your things.

12:07.135 --> 12:09.003
It's after three in the morning.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.338
What's going on?

12:10.438 --> 12:13.574
Please stop asking
questions and grab your stuff.

12:14.710 --> 12:15.977
You're skimming with me.

12:16.077 --> 12:19.380
What is it?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.783
Is that a gun?

12:20.883 --> 12:21.750
- Why do you have a gun?
- Yes,

12:21.850 --> 12:23.518
now get the fuck out of bed.

12:26.187 --> 12:28.156
Please do what I say.

12:29.223 --> 12:30.525
Just grab your things.

12:31.727 --> 12:32.627
We're going.

12:43.037 --> 12:44.372
You'd better explain
to me what's going on.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.473
We're not safe.

12:46.207 --> 12:47.108
What did you do?

12:47.208 --> 12:48.075
I didn't do anything.

12:48.176 --> 12:51.212
I mean, do you trust me?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.247
I don't know, you have a fucking gun.

12:53.347 --> 12:54.982
If you get your things,

12:55.082 --> 12:57.652
I will tell you everything in the car.

12:57.753 --> 13:00.955
I'm not going anywhere with
you until I get some answers.

13:01.757 --> 13:02.657
Okay.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.660
Maybe I haven't been completely honest.

13:05.761 --> 13:08.062
My line of work isn't really

13:09.063 --> 13:11.199
- legal.
- Drugs?

13:11.299 --> 13:12.200
No.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.806
- Did you kill someone?
- Good God, no.

13:17.906 --> 13:18.874
Then what is it?

13:18.973 --> 13:21.142
- I can't tell you exactly.
- Why?

13:21.242 --> 13:23.077
- Why, Trent?
- Because if you knew,

13:23.177 --> 13:24.813
then they would be after you, too.

13:24.913 --> 13:26.715
The less you know, the better.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.519
Too.

13:31.619 --> 13:32.721
Trent, stop hinting around
it, tell me what is...

13:32.821 --> 13:35.256
No, see, if I tell you anything...

13:40.194 --> 13:43.531
This is why we're going
to Denver, isn't it?

13:44.565 --> 13:45.734
Not exactly.

13:50.973 --> 13:52.373
You've been running.

13:54.008 --> 13:55.109
This trip.

13:58.079 --> 14:00.248
How can you be so selfish?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.754
Masking this dream we have

14:07.221 --> 14:09.423
as an alibi for your problem.

14:09.524 --> 14:12.126
I'm sorry things have
gotten complicated,

14:12.226 --> 14:13.962
but my life is messy, Ali.

14:14.061 --> 14:18.065
I know you can't understand
that, but this, this trip, this,

14:19.233 --> 14:23.070
this trip, it'll change
everything, it'll fix it.

14:25.273 --> 14:29.678
Denver is still our future
and that hasn't ever changed,

14:29.778 --> 14:31.747
not even with what you know now.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.184
I am scared, Alison.

14:39.053 --> 14:40.454
I don't want to lose you

14:41.422 --> 14:44.258
and I don't want to do this without you.

14:55.202 --> 14:56.637
These people,

14:58.907 --> 15:00.207
do they know who I am?

15:04.813 --> 15:06.547
I don't, I don't think so.

15:06.647 --> 15:08.282
You don't think so?

15:08.382 --> 15:09.718
This is our lives, Trent.

15:09.818 --> 15:12.587
Which, that, which is
why we have to go now.

15:13.689 --> 15:15.089
It's the only way.

15:16.058 --> 15:17.826
- I'm going ahead of you.
- What?

15:17.926 --> 15:19.393
- Why would you do...
- Trent,

15:19.493 --> 15:24.532
if we are going to get to
Denver, we need to be safe.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.768
This way, it protects both of us.

15:26.868 --> 15:29.270
- I can protect us.
- Can you?

15:35.877 --> 15:36.845
Here.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.313
- Take this.
- No, I don't want this.

15:39.413 --> 15:41.515
I've never touched a gun before.

15:43.618 --> 15:47.121
Just please take this, in case.

15:47.221 --> 15:49.357
It would make me feel better.

15:51.592 --> 15:52.928
How are you going to stay protected?

15:53.028 --> 15:54.528
I'll be careful.

15:54.629 --> 15:57.766
Here, this, this should be enough.

15:57.866 --> 16:01.003
Rent a car, ditch ours,
they'll be looking for it.

16:01.103 --> 16:04.740
Don't talk to anyone and make
as few stops as possible.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.307
Get food and bathroom breaks in

16:06.407 --> 16:08.542
only when you fill up for gas.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.646
How are you going to get there?

16:11.747 --> 16:13.081
Don't worry about me.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.883
I'm good at thinking on my feet.

16:15.751 --> 16:16.918
I will be there.

16:18.319 --> 16:19.955
Oh, no cell phones either.

16:20.055 --> 16:21.723
Another way they'll be able to find us.

16:24.126 --> 16:25.626
How do I get ahold of you?

16:26.728 --> 16:27.628
You won't.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.198
Just trust.

16:32.566 --> 16:35.070
There's a diner off of Colfax Avenue.

16:35.169 --> 16:38.740
I'll be waiting for you
in the booth in the back

16:39.573 --> 16:43.845
at 11:15 am sharp two days from now, okay?

16:49.650 --> 16:50.451
Hey.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.653
Hey hey, that mountaintop.

16:53.889 --> 16:57.893
Love, we gotta climb if
we're gonna see that sky.

17:02.363 --> 17:03.531
I love you, girly.

17:06.101 --> 17:08.970
I love you, too.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.879
No.

18:05.026 --> 18:07.996
Just you and me, just you and me.

18:08.096 --> 18:08.997
I'm sorry, oh God...

18:12.333 --> 18:14.002
Color looks beautiful on you.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.041
Fuck.

18:22.778 --> 18:25.213
Henry, you wanna get in on this?

18:28.282 --> 18:29.718
Excuse him.

18:29.818 --> 18:30.584
Who needs you?

18:59.080 --> 19:00.816
Now just let it out, yeah.

19:00.916 --> 19:01.983
Oh, give me a shower.

19:03.317 --> 19:05.086
Don't spit on me, piece of shit.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.622
That's not looking too
good, I'll make it better.

19:10.959 --> 19:11.860
Oh.

19:14.095 --> 19:17.631
You done good, man, you done good.

19:17.732 --> 19:19.134
Woo!

19:19.234 --> 19:20.334
Ah, yeah.

19:23.738 --> 19:24.638
Hey oh.

19:25.439 --> 19:26.708
You want a cigarette?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.476
Nah, you don't smoke.

19:33.281 --> 19:34.582
What's your deal, man?

19:38.519 --> 19:40.956
Think I got a piece of
bone stuck in my knuckle.

19:43.859 --> 19:45.961
Got anything I can clean
this shit off with?

19:47.428 --> 19:49.030
There's a towel in the back.

20:01.508 --> 20:02.711
Don't get any of it on the car.

20:02.811 --> 20:05.113
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.616
Why do you always have to
make such a fucking mess?

20:08.717 --> 20:10.318
Because I like to have fun.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.720
You know, if I'm going to fucking work,

20:11.820 --> 20:13.755
I'm gonna have some fun doing it.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.725
A mess just means more work.

20:18.293 --> 20:19.761
You're just fucking nuts.

20:22.230 --> 20:23.131
Yeah.

20:23.798 --> 20:25.700
- Yeah, maybe I am.
- Sloppy.

20:28.303 --> 20:29.470
So, what's next?

20:30.504 --> 20:32.107
What do you mean, "What's next?"

20:32.207 --> 20:33.775
Bury the damn body.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.609
Fuck you.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.879
I cooked dinner, you do the dishes.

20:38.813 --> 20:41.582
Why do you always turn
this into a circus act?

20:43.285 --> 20:46.553
If they wanted a beating,
they would have asked for one.

20:46.654 --> 20:48.156
They wanted this one dead.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.557
Taking 20 minutes out of our morning

20:50.658 --> 20:52.761
to turn his face into hamburger

20:52.861 --> 20:56.298
doesn't make him any more
dead, it just makes a mess.

20:57.332 --> 20:59.734
You risked breaking your hand
over one lousy little job.

20:59.834 --> 21:02.804
That's what bullets are
for, you fucking moron.

21:04.339 --> 21:06.607
Goddamn bull in a China shop.

21:16.251 --> 21:17.686
You know, I'm retiring soon.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.089
Yeah, you've been
saying that for a while now.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.060
No, it's happening.

21:26.527 --> 21:29.931
I'm done, I'm getting off this ride.

21:33.234 --> 21:34.668
You think there's some sort of

21:34.769 --> 21:36.603
pension check waiting for you?

21:37.272 --> 21:38.373
Sorry to inform you, man,

21:38.472 --> 21:41.076
but there wasn't a 401k
when you signed up.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.344
They already know.

21:42.444 --> 21:44.212
What do you mean they already know?

21:44.312 --> 21:45.546
I told them.

21:46.613 --> 21:47.716
I'm moving on.

21:49.084 --> 21:51.585
And just like that, they
said, "Hey, no problem, Henry.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.723
"Let us know if you need a
letter of recommendation."

21:54.823 --> 21:56.024
Stop finger fucking me, man.

21:56.124 --> 21:57.624
Just get the lime and the
shovel outta the trunk,

21:57.726 --> 21:59.928
let's bury the body, and go eat.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.162
I'm tired, Tim.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.200
I've been around death way too long.

22:06.835 --> 22:08.870
You're a goddamn angel of death.

22:09.603 --> 22:10.739
You were made for this shit.

22:10.839 --> 22:13.408
This is who you are, Henry.

22:13.507 --> 22:15.910
Why do you think they've kept you around?

22:16.011 --> 22:17.345
Why do you think they
make sure your tracks

22:17.445 --> 22:18.545
- are covered up?
- My tracks?

22:18.645 --> 22:21.615
No no, those are your tracks

22:21.716 --> 22:24.585
and I'm always covering them up.

22:24.686 --> 22:28.456
I'm constantly wiping your ass

22:28.555 --> 22:31.059
and I'm fucking exhausted.

22:32.494 --> 22:34.095
It's time you cleaned up your own shit.

22:34.195 --> 22:35.596
Fuck you.

22:35.697 --> 22:37.098
All right, I make sure the job gets done.

22:37.198 --> 22:40.769
It's not my fault you've grown
some sort of pussy down there

22:40.869 --> 22:44.205
and now you want to complain
about being my cleanup bitch.

22:44.305 --> 22:45.840
You've gone soft, you limp dick.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.909
No pussy exit on this ride.

22:56.650 --> 23:00.021
Now get over there
and clean that shit up.

23:11.332 --> 23:12.233
Yeah.

23:13.234 --> 23:13.835
Yeah, we're done.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.703
I'm just wrapping things up.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.706
Okay.

23:19.573 --> 23:21.675
We're still in agreement, right?

23:21.776 --> 23:25.180
One more and I'm gone, a clean break.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.749
Two more?

23:28.649 --> 23:30.718
You promise me after this...

23:32.687 --> 23:34.255
Goddamn, you are heavy.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.758
Gotta work out, buddy.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.359
All right.

23:41.096 --> 23:41.763
Oh yeah.

23:44.399 --> 23:45.366
Mm, yummy yummy.

23:49.237 --> 23:50.138
Okay.

23:51.406 --> 23:53.908
You want something to drink?

23:54.675 --> 23:58.480
Yeah, probably dehydrated.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.661
Asshole.

24:14.762 --> 24:18.333
All right, two more and I'm gone.

24:24.606 --> 24:25.473
Yup.

24:25.573 --> 24:28.209
All right, dinner's served, bitch.

24:38.553 --> 24:39.454
Shit.

24:40.188 --> 24:44.259
Well, anything I do, it doesn't matter.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.659
To them, anyway.

24:46.528 --> 24:51.966
As long as they got big boy
Henry swinging his hammer.

25:23.198 --> 25:24.098
That them?

25:24.999 --> 25:25.900
Yup.

25:26.634 --> 25:28.570
Told 'em we took care of it, yeah?

25:28.670 --> 25:29.771
Yeah.

25:30.872 --> 25:33.741
I'm kind of hungry, you
wanna get some pancakes?

25:33.841 --> 25:35.276
We've got our next job.

25:36.244 --> 25:40.014
Some kid, shit head,
running with their stuff.

25:40.715 --> 25:42.550
- Where?
- Out in the Flint Hills,

25:42.650 --> 25:44.118
they think he's headed for Denver.

25:44.219 --> 25:45.119
Shit.

25:48.223 --> 25:50.458
I was really looking
forward to some pancakes.

25:53.861 --> 25:55.196
We have time.

26:02.303 --> 26:06.007
I could go for a coffee
and scrambled eggs.

26:06.107 --> 26:07.008
Yeah?

26:08.009 --> 26:10.111
Think I saw an IHOP a few miles back.

26:10.845 --> 26:12.914
Let's grab some grub, get a move on.

26:13.815 --> 26:16.351
You know they don't like us to be late.

26:17.318 --> 26:18.253
No, they don't.

26:41.442 --> 26:43.578
I say we head west
today across the bluffs.

26:43.679 --> 26:46.014
These byways aren't giving us any luck.

26:46.114 --> 26:48.283
We should hit interstate by nightfall.

26:53.121 --> 26:54.022
Ha.

26:55.290 --> 26:56.291
I spoke too soon.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.431
Hey man, need a ride?

27:03.531 --> 27:04.432
Yeah, that'd be great.

27:04.532 --> 27:06.501
My wife and I have been
walking all morning.

27:10.571 --> 27:11.906
Hey buddy, you okay?

27:33.294 --> 27:34.195
Hey.

27:36.799 --> 27:38.333
What are you doing?

27:38.433 --> 27:39.534
We just missed a ride.

27:40.736 --> 27:43.905
Come on, see if you can
get one all the way across.

27:45.173 --> 27:46.809
We gotta keep moving, love.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.477
Isn't this nice?

28:59.414 --> 29:00.314
Yeah.

29:04.051 --> 29:06.855
I love spending time alone with you.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.023
Too bad we can't get enough of it.

29:10.692 --> 29:11.959
I'm just never home.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.394
Ever since I married you,

29:13.494 --> 29:17.231
all I ever wanted was
just to make you happy.

29:18.901 --> 29:21.169
It just seems like it never added up.

29:22.670 --> 29:27.275
Remember that shit old apartment
we stayed in on Jefferson?

29:30.211 --> 29:31.979
With the spent oil tank.

29:32.079 --> 29:34.148
Didn't get above 10
degrees the whole week.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.417
And you got up in the middle of the nigh

29:36.517 --> 29:39.086
to go to the closet and
grab another blanket

29:39.922 --> 29:41.322
because you knew, because you knew

29:41.422 --> 29:42.891
if we'd raise that thermostat even

29:42.990 --> 29:45.493
one degree, we wouldn't make rent.

29:46.961 --> 29:50.164
And I just laid there,
pretending to be asleep,

29:52.567 --> 29:55.236
knowing there was nothing
I could do about it.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.972
Do you know how that
makes me feel, Michelle?

29:59.908 --> 30:01.008
As a man?

30:05.146 --> 30:07.716
We started a family.

30:07.816 --> 30:09.818
Did you have to bring that up?

30:09.918 --> 30:11.018
Benjamin.

30:17.124 --> 30:20.428
We have to get back to the road.

30:35.844 --> 30:37.078
I'm tired.

30:42.784 --> 30:43.752
Michelle.

30:48.489 --> 30:49.657
I'm not ready.

31:28.931 --> 31:29.998
Fucker.

31:34.068 --> 31:35.636
Fucker.

32:35.063 --> 32:36.163
Snake bite.

32:37.465 --> 32:38.366
Yeah.

32:40.134 --> 32:41.402
Did you do this?

32:41.502 --> 32:43.337
You weren't gonna make it.

32:43.437 --> 32:45.907
Poison had gotten pretty
deep into your system.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.777
Gave you some antivenom
and got you all cleaned up.

32:50.277 --> 32:51.379
Thanks.

32:53.447 --> 32:55.383
You carry antivenom on you?

32:56.550 --> 32:57.686
Of course.

32:57.786 --> 33:00.354
These hills are infested
with rattlesnakes.

33:01.489 --> 33:02.958
You gotta be more careful.

33:03.624 --> 33:06.128
They'll come out to the
road this time of year.

33:06.227 --> 33:07.561
Take care of yourself.

33:10.197 --> 33:14.335
Wait, what, what, are
you, what are, what,

33:14.435 --> 33:16.303
what are you doing out here?

33:18.372 --> 33:19.473
Playing hero.

33:21.777 --> 33:22.944
See any cars lately?

33:25.379 --> 33:27.181
We're probably due for one.

33:27.281 --> 33:28.416
You should rest.

33:29.951 --> 33:31.452
I got somewhere to be.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.521
Well then don't let me keep you.

33:54.743 --> 33:55.643
Shit.

34:06.387 --> 34:07.956
Got any water left in there?

34:09.057 --> 34:10.591
Uh, yeah.

34:11.525 --> 34:12.426
Here.

34:25.907 --> 34:27.308
You really do need to
be more prepared out here.

34:27.408 --> 34:29.643
Yeah well, I don't do this that often.

34:34.415 --> 34:35.951
What's "this"?

34:36.051 --> 34:38.552
Um, hitchhiking.

34:48.562 --> 34:49.463
What?

34:51.398 --> 34:52.167
What are you doing?

34:52.266 --> 34:53.702
Why are you laying there?

34:54.401 --> 34:55.636
I'm hitchhiking.

34:57.038 --> 34:58.073
What if, what if a car comes?

34:58.173 --> 34:59.741
You're not gonna be able to see it.

34:59.841 --> 35:01.176
I'm not going to try and see someone

35:01.275 --> 35:03.410
- that won't try and see me.
- What?

35:05.247 --> 35:07.481
- I'm filtering.
- Filtering.

35:07.581 --> 35:09.483
Yeah, the bullshit.

35:10.218 --> 35:11.686
Saves me the hassle of broadcasting myself

35:11.787 --> 35:13.487
to an audience that won't listen.

35:13.587 --> 35:15.157
What does that even mean?

35:15.257 --> 35:16.158
You're lying in the dirt in the

35:16.258 --> 35:18.292
- middle of nowhere.
- Yeah.

35:19.161 --> 35:20.061
Sound familiar?

35:26.333 --> 35:28.536
What's got you in such a hurry, anyway?

35:31.239 --> 35:32.207
I'd say by that right hook,

35:32.306 --> 35:34.308
you're trying to get away from someone.

35:36.812 --> 35:39.948
- You don't know me.
- No, I don't.

35:41.950 --> 35:44.686
But I do know when I see
someone who's running.

35:48.422 --> 35:49.523
Name's Ben.

35:53.394 --> 35:55.396
Mine's Travis.

35:58.499 --> 36:00.334
- Running thief, huh?
- What?

36:01.169 --> 36:02.270
Well, let's just hope Trent doesn't

36:02.369 --> 36:04.840
- find you out here.
- What?

36:06.007 --> 36:06.908
The bag.

36:10.812 --> 36:12.714
You don't have to worry, Trent.

36:13.447 --> 36:15.150
I wouldn't trust some
guy sitting in the dirt

36:15.250 --> 36:17.118
out in the middle of nowhere either.

36:21.323 --> 36:22.423
Besides,

36:25.060 --> 36:26.928
I'd never lose a fair fight.

36:34.602 --> 36:36.503
So how long you been out here?

36:38.039 --> 36:39.741
Oh, I don't know.

36:41.109 --> 36:42.010
Couple days?

36:45.981 --> 36:47.182
Weeks?

36:51.019 --> 36:52.553
Oh shit, years?

36:54.488 --> 36:57.092
- Give or take.
- Years.

36:58.626 --> 37:00.394
Did Obama get that second term?

37:00.494 --> 37:02.030
Fuck this.

37:05.000 --> 37:05.901
Okay.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.869
That was short-lived.

37:10.537 --> 37:11.940
He's definitely running.

37:19.513 --> 37:20.447
Want some?

37:20.547 --> 37:21.983
Do you know where the interstate is?

37:26.221 --> 37:27.122
What's so funny?

37:28.056 --> 37:29.456
What's so fucking funny?

37:37.699 --> 37:41.002
I've never seen someone
run so fast to nowhere.

37:44.339 --> 37:45.273
Okay I'm just a little lost

37:45.373 --> 37:46.841
and I needed a little sense direction.

37:46.942 --> 37:48.542
Do you think you can help me
out or are you just going to

37:48.642 --> 37:50.779
sit in the dirt another couple years?

37:50.879 --> 37:52.914
You know, I make it a point

37:53.014 --> 37:55.482
in my meager existence to say your truth.

37:56.818 --> 37:59.087
I've been alone out here for a while now.

38:00.789 --> 38:03.557
It allows me just to let things pass by.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.626
Gives me a chance to soak it all in.

38:05.727 --> 38:08.629
I know when I see
someone who's on the run.

38:08.730 --> 38:10.098
Look, you don't understand...

38:10.198 --> 38:11.700
- Hey hey.
- You don't get...

38:11.800 --> 38:13.768
You know where you're heading out there?

38:15.737 --> 38:18.907
Being lost is a pretty shitty feeling.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.009
I know a lot about that.

38:22.077 --> 38:23.845
So, I offered you the only thing I had.

38:23.945 --> 38:26.881
A little bit of water
and a shit load of time.

38:28.116 --> 38:29.250
I don't have that.

38:29.351 --> 38:31.518
You're gonna have to, out here.

38:32.619 --> 38:35.223
I mean, that snake bite
almost took you out.

38:35.323 --> 38:36.825
You're not invincible.

38:44.665 --> 38:46.500
Ever have deer jerky before?

38:46.600 --> 38:48.737
No, not much of a hunter.

38:49.503 --> 38:50.872
No, me neither.

38:50.972 --> 38:52.741
I'm not into killing animals.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.643
Do you know I picked this shit up

38:56.745 --> 38:58.213
off the side of the
road a couple days back?

38:58.313 --> 38:59.214
Oh fuck.

39:00.882 --> 39:03.550
Fucking fuck, God.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.988
Relax.

39:08.223 --> 39:09.124
It's just jerky.

39:17.932 --> 39:18.833
Ugh, God.

39:21.369 --> 39:22.837
Where are you headed?

39:22.937 --> 39:25.273
You know, I don't know yet.

39:26.441 --> 39:28.276
- You don't know?
- Yet.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.846
So, when will you know?

39:32.747 --> 39:35.316
- Oh, when I hitch a ride.
- No shit.

39:36.484 --> 39:38.253
No, the right ride for me.

39:40.587 --> 39:41.723
What, you're trying to tell me you're

39:41.823 --> 39:44.726
some Forrest Gump trek
of life or something?

39:45.827 --> 39:48.029
I didn't exactly pack my magic shoe.

39:51.632 --> 39:52.834
You running, too?

39:54.235 --> 39:55.136
Too?

40:00.241 --> 40:02.010
I'm not running, I'm,

40:05.646 --> 40:06.748
I'm chasing.

40:07.614 --> 40:08.716
Oh yeah?

40:10.552 --> 40:13.388
What's that, other than a run?

40:14.089 --> 40:16.057
Okay, this is going to sound dumb.

40:17.325 --> 40:19.227
I'm looking for ever after.

40:20.661 --> 40:22.964
The proverbial happily ever after?

40:23.064 --> 40:26.101
Yeah, it sounds lame when you
say it like that, nevermind.

40:28.970 --> 40:30.371
Why do we always have to put our asses

40:30.472 --> 40:32.606
out there for other people's bullshit?

40:34.142 --> 40:38.413
I mean, why is it bad
to chase what I want?

40:38.513 --> 40:39.613
Is that wrong?

40:41.615 --> 40:42.717
Fuck em.

40:43.518 --> 40:44.618
Who?

40:45.587 --> 40:46.721
It doesn't matter now.

40:46.821 --> 40:48.756
Hey give, let me have
some more of that jerky.

40:49.557 --> 40:51.459
I didn't know how hungry I was.

40:56.898 --> 40:59.100
Life is an interesting game, isn't it?

41:01.769 --> 41:03.637
I've crapped out lots of times.

41:05.773 --> 41:07.375
I used to let things get to me.

41:08.409 --> 41:09.911
Now I just let it roll off.

41:12.413 --> 41:14.215
How are you satisfied with that?

41:15.550 --> 41:17.118
It's not about satisfaction.

41:19.387 --> 41:20.822
It's about understanding.

41:21.923 --> 41:23.324
That's bullshit, then.

41:24.626 --> 41:26.361
You're not a fucking tumbleweed.

41:27.028 --> 41:31.166
Isn't there anything
you want more than this?

41:34.135 --> 41:35.036
I don't know.

41:38.573 --> 41:39.673
So,

41:41.376 --> 41:42.810
where you're from?

41:43.545 --> 41:44.913
Kansas City.

41:45.980 --> 41:49.717
- Oh yeah, Kansas or Missouri?
- Missouri.

41:49.817 --> 41:51.786
- KCMO.
- Okay.

41:52.420 --> 41:54.389
There's a difference, trust me.

41:54.489 --> 41:56.724
- What's that?
- A shit ton.

41:57.926 --> 41:59.861
The one thing we share is a name.

42:01.763 --> 42:03.264
Fucking hate Kansas.

42:04.999 --> 42:07.135
What about you, where you from?

42:08.870 --> 42:09.971
All over.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.207
What does that mean?

42:13.141 --> 42:16.177
I've been traveling so long,
I really don't have a from.

42:19.847 --> 42:21.316
What do you carry in that bag?

42:23.785 --> 42:24.919
Excuse me?

42:25.019 --> 42:26.621
Being here in the middle of nowhere

42:26.721 --> 42:28.022
with nothing to your name but

42:28.122 --> 42:31.292
that beat up old hat, this
crusty jerky, and that bag,

42:31.392 --> 42:34.495
that bag's gotta be the most
valuable thing in your life.

42:38.166 --> 42:39.067
Um.

42:40.835 --> 42:41.936
All right.

42:52.681 --> 42:55.283
What the hell's this?

43:04.859 --> 43:08.896
- Hello?
- Hey babe, how's it going?

43:10.164 --> 43:11.833
- Hey, love.
- How're my ladies doing?

43:11.933 --> 43:13.768
Oh, we're hanging in there.

43:14.435 --> 43:15.003
You're in the nursery,

43:15.103 --> 43:16.771
- aren't you?
- Mm-hm.

43:16.871 --> 43:18.873
Gotten anything new done in there?

43:18.973 --> 43:21.542
Well, the walls are painted purple

43:21.643 --> 43:23.645
because you know I hate pink,

43:23.746 --> 43:26.481
the crib is up, and the mobile is hung.

43:26.581 --> 43:28.449
What about the bookshelf?

43:28.549 --> 43:29.784
It's up, too.

43:29.884 --> 43:30.918
I've been filling it with some

43:31.019 --> 43:33.154
books I found in my mom's attic.

43:38.694 --> 43:39.527
On one of my runs, I stopped at

43:39.627 --> 43:41.262
a flea market down in Phoenix.

43:42.363 --> 43:45.300
There's this older woman there
who made these worry dolls.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.802
She said you were supposed
to share all your worries

43:47.902 --> 43:50.706
to the doll and it'll
take them away from you.

43:50.805 --> 43:52.540
You are always buying stuff.

43:53.207 --> 43:54.242
I don't think this nursery

43:54.342 --> 43:56.177
can hold everything you bring home.

43:56.277 --> 43:59.580
I made that one, the
woman taught me how.

43:59.682 --> 44:03.251
It's beautiful, I love it.

44:03.351 --> 44:04.787
Well, I gotta run.

44:04.886 --> 44:06.954
I'm gonna grab a hot shower.

44:07.055 --> 44:08.489
I'll see you on Thursday.

44:09.924 --> 44:12.126
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

44:25.406 --> 44:26.908
Let go of that.

44:39.354 --> 44:41.289
Why are you carrying rocks in your bag

44:41.389 --> 44:43.358
I don't need to explain
shit to you, all right?

44:43.458 --> 44:46.829
- How dare you invade my life?
- Invade your life?

44:46.928 --> 44:48.229
What's wrong with you?

44:49.030 --> 44:50.631
Don't expect people to pour
their hearts out to you

44:50.733 --> 44:52.701
so you can guide them through life,

44:52.801 --> 44:54.102
give them a piece of your wisdom,

44:54.202 --> 44:55.903
and then bitch our when they
put it into the spotlight.

44:56.003 --> 44:56.904
Excuse me?

44:57.538 --> 44:59.907
- You don't know shit.
- It's all over your face.

45:00.007 --> 45:01.509
Who saved your sorry ass?

45:02.176 --> 45:03.611
You think you know something?

45:03.712 --> 45:04.747
You think you know somebody?

45:04.847 --> 45:06.981
I've got years on you, you piss ant.

45:07.081 --> 45:09.484
You've got a lot to learn
about life and people.

45:09.584 --> 45:12.821
- Yeah, more like you forgot.
- Stay away from me, Trent.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.555
Forget we ever crossed paths.

45:16.424 --> 45:17.826
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't matter,

45:17.925 --> 45:19.695
you can be somebody else's problem.

45:19.795 --> 45:21.697
No, I didn't mean it that way.

45:21.797 --> 45:23.264
No, you're hurt, Ben.

45:24.132 --> 45:26.534
- It's obvious.
- Hey, stop, all right?

45:26.634 --> 45:27.935
You're right, all right?

45:28.035 --> 45:29.036
I buddied up to you trying to solve

45:29.137 --> 45:31.472
your problems like some roadside Dr. Phil.

45:31.572 --> 45:34.575
You found the bullshit card,
so just move on, Trent.

45:34.675 --> 45:36.911
I'm sorry, all right, I'm sorry.

45:39.882 --> 45:40.982
So that's it.

45:42.483 --> 45:44.152
This is bullshit.

45:45.353 --> 45:47.588
- Who's running now?
- C'mon.

45:50.425 --> 45:51.926
What the fuck do you want from me,

45:52.026 --> 45:53.027
- huh?
- I don't know.

45:53.127 --> 45:54.462
That I'm some piece of shit truck driver

45:54.562 --> 45:57.365
that was always working,
always on the road?

45:58.199 --> 46:01.269
I drove as fast as I could,
but I honestly thought

46:01.369 --> 46:03.538
everyone was freaking out over nothing.

46:05.606 --> 46:06.474
I,

46:16.184 --> 46:18.352
I didn't see the signs.

46:23.491 --> 46:25.092
I was ignorant

46:27.228 --> 46:28.463
and a fucking idiot.

46:40.141 --> 46:41.642
I took them for granted.

46:43.244 --> 46:45.346
- I didn't realize.
- Ben.

46:46.915 --> 46:48.983
She was the only one

46:50.651 --> 46:51.552
who loved me.

46:54.322 --> 46:59.360
Even when I wasn't there
for her, she still loved me.

47:02.997 --> 47:05.066
I knew what they were all saying.

47:07.903 --> 47:10.471
I knew what they all thought.

47:11.172 --> 47:12.774
But I didn't give a shit.

47:16.344 --> 47:20.147
But she knew, she knew the truth.

47:26.254 --> 47:31.325
I was her strength, dammit,
and I fucking lost her.

47:32.995 --> 47:34.763
I lost both of them.

47:35.663 --> 47:37.231
I lost both of em

47:39.768 --> 47:42.537
to this.

47:43.906 --> 47:44.806
This road.

48:04.793 --> 48:05.761
So I walk.

48:09.932 --> 48:12.366
Lost.

48:12.466 --> 48:15.503
Because I lost everything to this road.

48:20.174 --> 48:21.542
I ain't running, man.

48:47.002 --> 48:48.971
What's your fucking deal, man?

48:49.071 --> 48:50.839
You haven't said shit to me
since breakfast and you just

48:50.939 --> 48:53.909
sat there staring at your
phone the whole fucking time.

48:54.009 --> 48:54.876
What's going on?

48:58.646 --> 49:01.616
We are all formed of frailty and error.

49:03.184 --> 49:05.286
That is the first law of nature.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.589
What the fuck are you talking about?

49:10.726 --> 49:12.526
Voltaire, an asshole.

49:12.627 --> 49:15.396
Is that some sort of
men's cologne or something?

49:16.397 --> 49:17.933
Look, instead of being
all cryptic and shit,

49:18.033 --> 49:19.034
if you've got something to say,

49:19.133 --> 49:20.401
just say it to my fucking face, all right?

49:20.501 --> 49:22.403
You don't have a problem
whizzing bullets past my head.

49:22.503 --> 49:26.708
I want 30 on pump one and
I want some sunflower seeds

49:28.542 --> 49:30.177
- and I want change.
- Okay.

49:30.277 --> 49:32.346
- Buy your own smokes.
- All right.

49:36.918 --> 49:38.419
Guy is fucking losing it.

49:55.336 --> 49:58.205
Yeah, it's a pretty town, eh?

50:00.675 --> 50:01.575
Yeah.

51:34.268 --> 51:35.336
Hey, where are you going?

51:36.004 --> 51:37.072
Where you going?

51:37.172 --> 51:38.173
That your ride over there?

51:38.272 --> 51:39.741
It's a nice ride.

51:39.841 --> 51:41.910
Where are you staying, you new in town?

51:42.576 --> 51:43.912
Well, you got a phone number?

51:44.012 --> 51:47.783
Hey, I bet you got them panties
with the words on em, huh?

52:10.272 --> 52:11.372
Did you get my seeds?

52:11.472 --> 52:13.074
Yeah, I got your seeds.

52:18.546 --> 52:20.849
What'd you think about that one?

52:22.884 --> 52:23.852
That one?

52:25.053 --> 52:26.554
Eh, he was okay.

52:28.056 --> 52:29.557
Keeping my options open.

52:30.725 --> 52:34.062
That option I think
wouldn't be a real good catch.

52:35.362 --> 52:37.265
Henry, you old horn dog.

52:38.033 --> 52:40.802
She's not gonna want a suck
on this old saggy balls.

52:40.902 --> 52:42.070
Why don't you leave the bitches to me

52:42.170 --> 52:44.005
and do what you do best?

52:45.740 --> 52:47.843
That's exactly what I'm doing.

53:12.633 --> 53:14.401
Well, this here's your culprit, ma'am.

53:15.136 --> 53:16.304
I really appreciate this.

53:16.403 --> 53:17.538
Oh, you're welcome.

53:17.638 --> 53:19.040
You know, you're lucky I
was headed out this way.

53:19.140 --> 53:22.110
I got a bull that got outta
pasture about 10 miles west here

53:22.210 --> 53:26.614
and I don't get out here too
often, so you're pretty lucky.

53:37.591 --> 53:38.960
You folks use a hand?

53:39.060 --> 53:43.164
Actually, I just got this
young lady taken care of, so.

53:44.632 --> 53:45.800
Sorry about this.

53:58.213 --> 53:59.247
Woo!

54:01.716 --> 54:03.450
Don't fucking kill her.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.123
Man oh man, the reaper bleeds.

54:08.223 --> 54:09.124
- Shut up.
- Hey,

54:09.224 --> 54:10.959
don't get any on the seat.

54:11.059 --> 54:13.028
Watch it.

54:13.128 --> 54:14.729
Shit man, seriously, though.

54:14.829 --> 54:16.698
In the eight years that
we've been working together,

54:16.798 --> 54:19.134
the hits that I've seen you take down

54:19.234 --> 54:20.702
and the near death moments that we've

54:20.802 --> 54:22.971
just fucking scraped by and nothing,

54:23.071 --> 54:28.310
nothing compares to your
ultimate rival, 120 pound Barbie.

54:28.843 --> 54:32.513
I can't wait to collect.

54:32.613 --> 54:35.016
Oh God, when the guys here about this,

54:35.116 --> 54:38.086
they'll stop busting
my balls for a change.

54:46.861 --> 54:48.897
You did good work, man.

54:48.997 --> 54:49.898
Yeah?

54:53.101 --> 54:54.002
Yeah.

54:55.837 --> 54:58.139
Do you think we're close?

54:59.975 --> 55:02.010
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

55:03.345 --> 55:05.280
Then let's light this bitch up.

55:27.268 --> 55:28.837
So what's going to happen?

55:30.071 --> 55:32.506
Kill me, of course.

55:36.677 --> 55:38.512
Can't let that happen, though.

55:40.181 --> 55:41.249
She's waiting for me.

55:43.451 --> 55:44.551
Who?

55:59.367 --> 56:00.268
Whoa.

56:02.504 --> 56:03.872
She's beautiful.

56:05.974 --> 56:06.875
Alison.

56:10.245 --> 56:11.312
How'd you meet her?

56:14.449 --> 56:17.085
You know how they say love finds you?

56:19.653 --> 56:21.555
- Yeah.
- It found me.

56:23.925 --> 56:25.626
You'll never believe where.

56:32.599 --> 56:35.569
- So you fall?
- No.

56:35.669 --> 56:37.472
Yeah, kind of.

56:37.571 --> 56:39.640
You never heard of indoor skydiving?

56:40.275 --> 56:41.176
Not really.

56:43.577 --> 56:44.779
Whatever.

56:44.879 --> 56:47.949
These jobs keep getting
weirder and weirder.

56:48.049 --> 56:49.217
Come on.

57:23.384 --> 57:24.686
Drop's over there.

57:31.793 --> 57:34.162
C'mon Robbie, you can
be smarter than that.

57:34.929 --> 57:37.899
Let's get our suits and stick to the plan.

57:42.203 --> 57:43.204
- Hello.
- Hi.

57:43.304 --> 57:45.874
Hi guys, okay, so you're
going to need a suit.

57:45.974 --> 57:47.208
- Oh.
- This one's mine?

57:47.308 --> 57:48.076
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

57:48.176 --> 57:50.512
- Okay.
- This is way too much cool.

57:51.980 --> 57:54.249
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

58:15.937 --> 58:18.006
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

58:18.106 --> 58:19.707
Let's just get this shit done.

58:19.807 --> 58:20.975
What's going on?

58:21.709 --> 58:23.077
You're not going to like it.

58:23.178 --> 58:25.046
Robbie, half the shit
you say I don't like.

58:25.146 --> 58:28.082
- Just tell me.
- Hear about Darrel and Jason?

58:28.183 --> 58:29.117
What about em?

58:29.217 --> 58:30.218
They were supposed to
be on a high dollar drop

58:30.318 --> 58:31.719
- last week.
- So what?

58:31.819 --> 58:34.022
They asked me to go with Jason instead.

58:35.423 --> 58:37.292
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I know.

58:38.426 --> 58:39.861
But I think Darrel fucked up.

58:39.961 --> 58:41.896
I heard he wanted to know if
the that was inside the bag

58:41.996 --> 58:44.098
was worth more than the
money they were paying him.

58:44.199 --> 58:46.501
So they're switching up co-ops now?

58:46.601 --> 58:48.069
I started asking around.

58:48.937 --> 58:52.006
His crew, his family,
nobody's heard from him.

58:53.741 --> 58:54.976
Trent, that's what they
do with people like us,

58:55.076 --> 58:56.844
you know, if we don't stick to the plan.

58:56.945 --> 58:58.947
Apparently I'm not
part of this new plan.

58:59.047 --> 59:02.984
Trent, I'm worried things are changing.

59:05.386 --> 59:06.454
Get this shit done.

59:07.488 --> 59:09.490
We'll talk more about this later.

59:34.148 --> 59:38.119
- You ever do this before?
- No, first time.

59:38.920 --> 59:41.456
You're gonna love it,
there's nothing like it.

59:42.257 --> 59:43.692
It's not every day
you get a chance to fly,

59:43.791 --> 59:45.960
- right?
- Exactly.

59:46.060 --> 59:49.063
- I'm here once a week.
- Once a week?

59:49.163 --> 59:50.131
Yeah.

59:50.231 --> 59:51.734
If you had the opportunity to fly,

59:51.866 --> 59:54.335
wouldn't you do it as much as you could?

59:54.435 --> 59:55.738
- She's weird.
- Yeah,

59:55.837 --> 59:56.971
we tried to get her to go shopping

59:57.071 --> 59:58.840
or to the movies with us, but she'd rather

59:58.940 --> 1:00:01.009
be here with her head in the clouds.

1:00:01.710 --> 1:00:04.012
It's a different way to spend your time.

1:00:09.017 --> 1:00:12.320
You ever have a flying dream before?

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:13.454
Not in a while.

1:00:15.156 --> 1:00:16.824
This is what it feels like.

1:00:30.938 --> 1:00:32.006
Sup guys, y'all ready to fly?

1:00:32.106 --> 1:00:33.941
- Yeah.
- Cool, all right,

1:00:34.042 --> 1:00:36.077
well let's go ahead and
get all of our gear on.

1:00:36.177 --> 1:00:38.813
That way we'll have
everything ready to go.

1:00:38.913 --> 1:00:40.014
Ali, you don't need to hear this again,

1:00:40.114 --> 1:00:42.150
but for everybody else,
just remember relax,

1:00:42.250 --> 1:00:43.484
all right, hold nice and still,

1:00:43.584 --> 1:00:45.620
and just try to keep your
chin up the entire time.

1:00:45.721 --> 1:00:47.088
- Okay.
- All right,

1:00:47.188 --> 1:00:48.856
so Ali, I know you probably
wanted to hop in solo this time,

1:00:48.956 --> 1:00:50.793
but we're kind of backed
up and really busy.

1:00:50.892 --> 1:00:51.893
Do you mind pairing up with somebody?

1:00:51.993 --> 1:00:53.961
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

1:00:54.062 --> 1:00:56.597
How about you go with your friend here?

1:00:56.699 --> 1:00:58.599
Sound good, friend?

1:00:58.701 --> 1:01:00.868
Who am I supposed to go with?

1:01:00.968 --> 1:01:02.771
Do you mind going with my friend here?

1:01:02.870 --> 1:01:04.038
Yeah, that's fine.

1:01:04.138 --> 1:01:05.873
I'll go with you and then
Ali, you can go with...

1:01:05.973 --> 1:01:08.609
- Trent.
- Cool, all right.

1:01:08.711 --> 1:01:09.745
Ali, Trent, are you guys ready to fly?

1:01:09.844 --> 1:01:10.746
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:01:10.845 --> 1:01:11.646
Sweet, well let's hope in and fly.

1:01:11.747 --> 1:01:13.915
- All right.
- All right.

1:01:14.649 --> 1:01:17.418
Hey, don't get too distracted.

1:01:23.024 --> 1:01:23.792
All right I'll turn up

1:01:23.891 --> 1:01:24.992
- your time.
- Okay.

1:01:28.996 --> 1:01:30.298
- Nervous?
- No.

1:01:31.734 --> 1:01:34.035
- A little?
- Don't be.

1:01:34.969 --> 1:01:36.170
Here, hold my hands.

1:01:37.538 --> 1:01:41.642
When they start it up, don't
fight it, let it take you up.

1:01:43.044 --> 1:01:45.046
- Then what?
- Go with it.

1:01:47.482 --> 1:01:49.283
I'll hold onto you.

1:03:13.568 --> 1:03:14.535
- So?
- All right.

1:03:14.635 --> 1:03:16.037
- What'd you think?
- All right, all right,

1:03:16.137 --> 1:03:18.239
- it was cool.
- Right?

1:03:18.339 --> 1:03:19.340
Thanks for making me

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:21.676
not look like too much of a fool in there.

1:03:21.777 --> 1:03:24.045
It was fun.

1:03:29.417 --> 1:03:33.421
Looks like your friend
is handling it well.

1:03:40.729 --> 1:03:41.629
Oh god.

1:03:43.264 --> 1:03:45.500
So you really come here once a week?

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:48.369
Yeah, I've been coming
for about a month now.

1:03:48.469 --> 1:03:50.438
It's crazy, I know, but it just

1:03:50.538 --> 1:03:52.640
seems to be the best way to get a break.

1:03:53.909 --> 1:03:55.109
You don't need to know about that.

1:03:55.209 --> 1:03:56.712
A break from what?

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:00.648
People.

1:04:01.884 --> 1:04:04.552
Ah, like a boyfriend.

1:04:04.652 --> 1:04:05.721
No boyfriend.

1:04:06.755 --> 1:04:07.756
My parents.

1:04:07.856 --> 1:04:10.124
They're always poking
their head into something.

1:04:10.224 --> 1:04:11.325
It can be a little much.

1:04:11.425 --> 1:04:13.661
I actually have no
idea what that's like.

1:04:13.762 --> 1:04:14.696
It's exhausting.

1:04:15.530 --> 1:04:18.132
They mean well but they have
everything mapped out for me.

1:04:18.232 --> 1:04:19.667
That I know about.

1:04:20.668 --> 1:04:23.839
It sucks when other people
are calling the shots.

1:04:23.939 --> 1:04:25.172
It is exhausting.

1:04:26.808 --> 1:04:29.745
Even more so, you just feel robbed.

1:04:32.948 --> 1:04:33.916
- Hey.
- Hm?

1:04:34.016 --> 1:04:35.516
Did you forget something?

1:04:37.218 --> 1:04:38.553
- Thanks.
- Uh huh.

1:04:40.789 --> 1:04:41.790
What'd you think?

1:04:41.890 --> 1:04:42.791
You like it?

1:04:42.891 --> 1:04:46.093
Eh, it's not really my cup of tea.

1:04:46.193 --> 1:04:47.029
Next time.

1:04:47.128 --> 1:04:48.563
It gets better with practice.

1:04:48.663 --> 1:04:50.131
Oh, yeah.

1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:53.501
We can't be late.

1:04:56.137 --> 1:04:57.471
Sorry, I,

1:04:58.707 --> 1:05:00.174
I gotta get going.

1:05:00.274 --> 1:05:01.810
It's okay, I better
get back to my friends

1:05:01.910 --> 1:05:03.344
- anyway.
- Yeah.

1:05:06.647 --> 1:05:09.183
Can I see you again?

1:05:11.787 --> 1:05:13.154
You know where to find me.

1:05:16.925 --> 1:05:17.826
Yeah.

1:05:22.296 --> 1:05:24.432
Was she there next Sunday?

1:05:24.532 --> 1:05:25.466
Yeah.

1:05:25.566 --> 1:05:27.168
Yeah, we met up there every Sunday

1:05:27.268 --> 1:05:28.804
for the rest of the summer.

1:05:31.272 --> 1:05:33.041
Indoor skydiving?

1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:35.744
Yeah, indoor skydiving.

1:05:37.678 --> 1:05:42.483
You know how you look at a
woman that you're attracted to

1:05:43.317 --> 1:05:46.621
and then she gives you a look
back and then looks away,

1:05:47.388 --> 1:05:49.758
you know, waiting for the chase?

1:05:49.858 --> 1:05:50.859
Yeah.

1:05:53.227 --> 1:05:54.595
She never looked away.

1:05:56.965 --> 1:05:58.399
Her eyes never left mine.

1:06:00.201 --> 1:06:01.770
She didn't want the chase.

1:06:06.074 --> 1:06:07.743
So where is she waiting for you?

1:06:07.843 --> 1:06:08.744
Denver.

1:06:10.478 --> 1:06:12.714
We gotta be there by tomorrow.

1:06:12.814 --> 1:06:13.715
Denver?

1:06:14.816 --> 1:06:16.084
Tomorrow?

1:06:16.183 --> 1:06:17.085
You do know that's more than

1:06:17.184 --> 1:06:18.887
- 500 miles west?
- I know.

1:06:20.154 --> 1:06:21.255
We'll make it.

1:06:22.490 --> 1:06:25.093
There's not a lot of traffic out here.

1:06:25.192 --> 1:06:26.627
The nearest city is 30 plus miles...

1:06:26.728 --> 1:06:29.597
Just because you didn't
make it doesn't mean I won't.

1:06:32.868 --> 1:06:35.236
I'm sorry.

1:06:35.336 --> 1:06:37.271
I didn't mean to say it like that.

1:06:37.371 --> 1:06:38.472
No, it's okay.

1:06:39.808 --> 1:06:40.709
You're right.

1:06:42.044 --> 1:06:43.177
I don't, I don't care who's right.

1:06:43.277 --> 1:06:45.279
I just want to get there.

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:48.050
Don't you think they'll expect you

1:06:48.150 --> 1:06:50.551
- heading west?
- Maybe.

1:06:50.651 --> 1:06:53.554
Which is why I got to stay a step ahead.

1:06:53.654 --> 1:06:54.990
That's what brought me out here.

1:06:55.090 --> 1:06:59.627
I thought going through this,
this would keep me hidden.

1:06:59.728 --> 1:07:02.463
You know, if I'm in nowhere,
how can they get me?

1:07:03.264 --> 1:07:06.902
Yeah, but 500 miles in one day on foot?

1:07:08.402 --> 1:07:09.603
I don't know, Trent.

1:07:17.112 --> 1:07:18.212
How about you?

1:07:19.948 --> 1:07:20.849
Ben?

1:07:22.050 --> 1:07:23.685
Me?

1:07:23.785 --> 1:07:25.087
Yeah.

1:07:25.187 --> 1:07:26.420
Ben, you.

1:07:27.621 --> 1:07:28.522
Help me.

1:07:29.157 --> 1:07:30.624
Help me get out of this.

1:07:30.726 --> 1:07:31.625
I mean,

1:07:32.259 --> 1:07:34.562
I mean, shit, all this time.

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:41.268
You've been here, no, how
long have you been out here?

1:07:41.368 --> 1:07:43.171
Years, right?

1:07:43.270 --> 1:07:44.873
Just out here in these hills.

1:07:47.675 --> 1:07:50.511
- I got my own...
- No, no, you'd be perfect.

1:07:50.611 --> 1:07:52.279
No, you know these hills,
you know these hills

1:07:52.379 --> 1:07:54.348
like they were your own home.

1:07:54.448 --> 1:07:56.517
Come with me, Ben.

1:07:56.617 --> 1:07:59.154
You know all the shortcuts and the byways.

1:07:59.253 --> 1:08:00.222
You'd be the perfect person

1:08:00.321 --> 1:08:02.958
to get me out west under the radar.

1:08:03.992 --> 1:08:05.292
Can't you tell her
you're running behind?

1:08:05.392 --> 1:08:08.063
No, no, there's no
contacting each other.

1:08:08.163 --> 1:08:09.698
I don't have a phone.

1:08:09.798 --> 1:08:10.732
Cause then that way
they'd be able to find us.

1:08:10.832 --> 1:08:13.501
All we have is a location and a time.

1:08:14.836 --> 1:08:16.403
Ben, please.

1:08:16.504 --> 1:08:18.372
They won't just kill me.

1:08:21.009 --> 1:08:22.110
I can't be a part of any more...

1:08:22.210 --> 1:08:24.012
- Fuck.
- I just can't.

1:08:36.691 --> 1:08:37.591
All right.

1:08:40.394 --> 1:08:42.998
I know this back road,
five miles east of here.

1:08:43.865 --> 1:08:45.033
That's the wrong way.

1:08:46.768 --> 1:08:47.601
There'll be a truck stop there

1:08:47.702 --> 1:08:49.503
where a lot of I70 truckers stop.

1:08:50.172 --> 1:08:51.940
There'll be a lot of Colorado plates.

1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.943
You're bound to catch a ride there.

1:08:58.312 --> 1:08:59.413
You sure?

1:09:00.648 --> 1:09:03.084
Yeah, it was my route.

1:09:06.054 --> 1:09:06.955
I guess.

1:09:09.423 --> 1:09:12.060
I've been trying to find
a faster way out of here,

1:09:13.261 --> 1:09:14.361
a better way,

1:09:17.498 --> 1:09:18.666
since I lost them.

1:09:22.771 --> 1:09:23.671
Trust me.

1:09:27.242 --> 1:09:29.077
Okay.

1:10:12.453 --> 1:10:14.622
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1:10:19.027 --> 1:10:20.161
Where you headed?

1:10:20.262 --> 1:10:22.898
Oh, there's a truck stop
about five miles east of here.

1:10:23.865 --> 1:10:25.700
Yeah, we know where that is.

1:10:28.203 --> 1:10:29.371
Car break down?

1:10:29.470 --> 1:10:31.273
Oh, I don't have a car.

1:10:31.373 --> 1:10:35.143
So what are you doing out
here in the middle of nowhere?

1:10:35.243 --> 1:10:36.677
Uh, just traveling.

1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:41.448
Traveling? On foot?

1:10:42.684 --> 1:10:44.819
What, are you on some kind
of crusade or something?

1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:45.820
Aren't we all?

1:10:48.656 --> 1:10:49.758
Where you guys heading?

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:54.628
Not really heading anywhere.

1:10:55.462 --> 1:10:56.597
How do you mean?

1:10:57.665 --> 1:11:01.568
It's uh, It's not so much a where.

1:11:02.603 --> 1:11:03.705
But a who.

1:11:07.608 --> 1:11:11.313
- Who are you looking for?
- A friend of ours.

1:11:11.413 --> 1:11:12.747
Got lost out here.

1:11:14.716 --> 1:11:16.550
The Flint Hills, they're like,

1:11:17.584 --> 1:11:20.121
like the Bermuda Triangle of the Midwest

1:11:22.324 --> 1:11:24.726
You know, people, they, they get in he

1:11:24.826 --> 1:11:26.795
and then they just disappear.

1:11:28.296 --> 1:11:29.831
It's kind of freaky, really.

1:11:31.399 --> 1:11:33.868
- What do you think, Henry?
- Shit, yeah.

1:11:35.837 --> 1:11:38.605
It's, it's open, desolate.

1:11:39.874 --> 1:11:42.811
Real easy for somebody to lose their way

1:11:46.948 --> 1:11:49.583
- Could you pull over?
- What's wrong?

1:11:49.684 --> 1:11:51.086
I just gotta piss.

1:11:53.054 --> 1:11:53.989
Can you hold it?

1:11:55.790 --> 1:11:56.623
We're almost there.

1:11:56.725 --> 1:11:58.927
Yeah, no, I really gotta go.

1:11:59.961 --> 1:12:02.030
If you could just pull
out right over here.

1:12:02.130 --> 1:12:03.031
I'll be quick.

1:12:05.532 --> 1:12:06.533
All right, Henry.

1:12:06.633 --> 1:12:08.737
I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go.

1:12:09.570 --> 1:12:11.439
I guess so.

1:12:27.756 --> 1:12:30.091
You don't have to be shy,
we're all men out here.

1:12:30.191 --> 1:12:31.059
No, don't worry.

1:12:31.159 --> 1:12:33.361
What's the matter, you got a small dick?

1:12:33.461 --> 1:12:34.996
I mean it's okay if you got a tiny pecker,

1:12:35.096 --> 1:12:36.563
we won't laugh too hard.

1:12:37.365 --> 1:12:39.566
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1:12:41.903 --> 1:12:44.272
I don't think you want to be running.

1:12:52.113 --> 1:12:53.148
Ali, Ali.

1:12:53.248 --> 1:12:55.884
No no no no, don't shoot
her, don't, don't shoot her.

1:12:55.984 --> 1:12:56.885
Yeah.

1:12:58.987 --> 1:13:00.088
Does she think you have a little dick?

1:13:02.090 --> 1:13:02.991
Do you?

1:13:04.658 --> 1:13:06.694
Does he got a little midget dick?

1:13:06.795 --> 1:13:09.596
No no no, don't, don't,
don't, don't hurt her, please.

1:13:10.899 --> 1:13:12.599
That's pretty fucked up.

1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:15.703
This midget dick motherfucker
got you into shit.

1:13:15.804 --> 1:13:17.939
Gonna get you killed and couldn't
even probably get you off.

1:13:18.039 --> 1:13:19.307
Please don't, don't hurt her.

1:13:19.407 --> 1:13:21.642
Did you really think he
couldn't be found, Trent?

1:13:21.743 --> 1:13:23.178
Look, I know who you are.

1:13:23.278 --> 1:13:24.611
I know they sent you.

1:13:24.712 --> 1:13:26.047
I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

1:13:26.147 --> 1:13:28.649
I'm just trying to get out of this shit.

1:13:30.752 --> 1:13:32.821
Fuck, no, fuck, stop.

1:13:32.921 --> 1:13:34.756
Just stop, please stop.

1:13:34.856 --> 1:13:36.991
No, you know what,
you fucking stop, okay?

1:13:37.092 --> 1:13:39.626
- Don't fucking move.
- Okay, no, I'm sorry.

1:13:39.727 --> 1:13:40.829
I'm sorry, just, no, I'm sorry.

1:13:43.932 --> 1:13:45.567
I'm sorry, no no, tell them I'm sorry.

1:13:45.666 --> 1:13:47.634
Yeah, it's a little
late for sorries, Trent.

1:13:47.735 --> 1:13:49.337
Damn, I know my head wasn't on straight.

1:13:49.437 --> 1:13:50.238
Yeah, no, here.

1:13:50.338 --> 1:13:51.773
Here, here, here's the bag.

1:13:51.873 --> 1:13:54.442
Here's the bag, now just don't hurt her.

1:13:59.314 --> 1:14:00.815
She's bleeding, man, come on.

1:14:00.915 --> 1:14:02.616
- No, just, she just...
- Just stay the fuck back

1:14:02.717 --> 1:14:04.119
or I'm gonna put her
brains all over the ground.

1:14:04.219 --> 1:14:07.088
Okay, okay, I'll do whatever you say.

1:14:07.188 --> 1:14:08.490
Shut the fuck up.

1:14:08.590 --> 1:14:10.391
Jesus, just shut up.

1:14:10.492 --> 1:14:11.759
You must have a small dick, man.

1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:13.928
Look at you, look how pathetic you look.

1:14:14.028 --> 1:14:16.898
Crying like a little bitch
and your woman's in harm's way

1:14:16.998 --> 1:14:19.534
and bleeding out here in the
middle of fucking nowhere

1:14:19.633 --> 1:14:21.836
and you're running off
like a little pussy.

1:14:21.936 --> 1:14:24.172
Do you even know who you're fucking with

1:14:43.825 --> 1:14:46.361
It's here, it's what they want.

1:14:46.461 --> 1:14:47.362
Good.

1:14:48.429 --> 1:14:49.764
I guess we got what we need.

1:14:49.864 --> 1:14:51.266
Yeah, it is.

1:14:51.366 --> 1:14:52.333
I've done everything you said.

1:14:52.433 --> 1:14:54.335
Now please, will you let her go?

1:15:05.113 --> 1:15:06.247
Come on, baby.

1:15:18.226 --> 1:15:19.694
And they lived happily ever after.

1:15:28.703 --> 1:15:29.871
No, fuck.

1:15:33.007 --> 1:15:33.908
No.

1:15:36.377 --> 1:15:38.546
Oh God.

1:15:44.786 --> 1:15:46.020
That is beautiful.

1:15:50.758 --> 1:15:51.859
Oh God.

1:15:55.797 --> 1:15:58.066
You know how this works, Trent.

1:16:00.602 --> 1:16:04.072
You take from them, we take from you.

1:16:04.806 --> 1:16:06.241
Ah, yeah.

1:16:11.312 --> 1:16:12.580
Woo!

1:16:12.681 --> 1:16:13.781
Oh.

1:16:15.483 --> 1:16:19.654
Mm.

1:16:21.923 --> 1:16:25.026
Oh fuck, they should've paid
us double for that bitch.

1:16:28.596 --> 1:16:29.530
Yeah.

1:16:29.631 --> 1:16:30.765
Yeah, we've got it, package is secure.

1:16:30.865 --> 1:16:32.000
So are you going to
help me this time, huh?

1:16:32.100 --> 1:16:34.002
Cause I'm not burying
these fuckers by myself.

1:16:34.102 --> 1:16:35.937
Yeah, I should be back by nightfall.

1:16:36.037 --> 1:16:38.172
Hey, what'd you mean by "I"?

1:16:38.273 --> 1:16:40.575
- I'm taking care of that now.
- Oh shit.

1:17:55.550 --> 1:17:57.852
So what about you?

1:17:57.952 --> 1:18:00.555
What brings you out here
in the middle of nowhere?

1:18:01.422 --> 1:18:04.926
Ah, I had some loose ends to tie up.

1:18:05.893 --> 1:18:10.231
Now that that's done, get back to my life.

1:18:11.165 --> 1:18:13.901
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- My life?

1:18:16.504 --> 1:18:17.405
Retirement.

1:18:18.707 --> 1:18:19.607
Retirement?

1:18:21.342 --> 1:18:22.577
At your age?

1:18:22.677 --> 1:18:24.011
You either have a good paying job

1:18:24.112 --> 1:18:26.047
or the health risk must be high.

1:18:26.881 --> 1:18:29.150
A little of both.

1:18:29.250 --> 1:18:32.253
So, what are you planning
on doing in retirement?

1:18:33.321 --> 1:18:37.291
Fish, paint model airplanes,
play chess at the park?

1:18:38.326 --> 1:18:39.227
Um.

1:18:42.029 --> 1:18:44.198
I have no idea, but

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:48.236
whatever it is, I'm ready for it to start.

1:18:48.336 --> 1:18:51.973
- It's time, man.
- It is.

1:18:52.875 --> 1:18:53.975
Mm.

1:18:55.176 --> 1:18:56.344
You have a family?

1:18:57.545 --> 1:18:58.446
Never married.

1:19:00.716 --> 1:19:02.116
I do have a son, though.

1:19:03.384 --> 1:19:04.285
He's gotta be

1:19:04.952 --> 1:19:08.791
15, 16 years old by now.

1:19:08.891 --> 1:19:11.159
Hm, been a while since you've seen him?

1:19:12.093 --> 1:19:13.829
Yeah, the career didn't really

1:19:13.928 --> 1:19:15.963
mix too well with family life.

1:19:18.633 --> 1:19:19.967
Demanding line of work.

1:19:21.369 --> 1:19:22.270
Yeah.

1:19:23.237 --> 1:19:25.072
The same thing happened to me.

1:19:27.008 --> 1:19:28.309
I was a truck driver.

1:19:29.845 --> 1:19:31.512
I was always out on the road.

1:19:33.314 --> 1:19:36.484
Ended up losing my wife
and daughter because of it.

1:19:36.584 --> 1:19:39.053
Yeah, they tend to not
stick around too long

1:19:39.153 --> 1:19:41.289
when you're gone working all the time.

1:19:42.791 --> 1:19:43.692
Yeah.

1:19:47.763 --> 1:19:50.031
Are you gonna try and see your son?

1:19:51.800 --> 1:19:52.701
Yeah.

1:19:54.235 --> 1:19:55.737
Yeah, I think so.

1:19:58.774 --> 1:20:02.109
I look forward to him telling
me what a shitty father I am.

1:20:02.210 --> 1:20:05.012
Well, let him.

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.816
Let him flush all that out.

1:20:08.583 --> 1:20:12.119
Being there for him to do it, it'll count.

1:20:13.889 --> 1:20:14.989
It'll help heal.

1:20:19.728 --> 1:20:22.430
What about you, you
talk much to your family?

1:20:26.702 --> 1:20:29.470
No, my, my family passed away.

1:20:35.142 --> 1:20:37.445
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:20:38.412 --> 1:20:41.315
You know, when, when death is

1:20:42.350 --> 1:20:44.920
all that's been a part of your world,

1:20:45.019 --> 1:20:49.357
having a life is
impossible to think about.

1:20:50.993 --> 1:20:52.093
You know?

1:20:53.795 --> 1:20:54.696
Yeah.

1:20:56.865 --> 1:20:57.733
Yeah, I do.

1:21:02.203 --> 1:21:03.906
Mind if I turn this up?

1:21:04.006 --> 1:21:05.106
I like this song.

1:21:06.274 --> 1:21:08.075
No, not at all.

1:21:54.723 --> 1:21:57.960
I really appreciate this,
Henry, for the ride.

1:21:58.060 --> 1:21:59.160
No problem.

1:22:00.829 --> 1:22:02.864
I've been out there a long time.

1:22:02.965 --> 1:22:03.865
Too long.

1:22:05.299 --> 1:22:07.368
It's hard to get a ride out
in the middle of nowhere.

1:22:08.269 --> 1:22:09.403
It's just a matter of time.

1:22:09.503 --> 1:22:11.572
Somebody would have
picked you up eventually.

1:22:12.708 --> 1:22:13.608
Thanks.

1:22:31.158 --> 1:22:33.327
Something the matter?

1:22:34.730 --> 1:22:35.897
No.

1:22:35.998 --> 1:22:36.898
No.

1:22:39.067 --> 1:22:40.167
I'm good.

1:22:52.313 --> 1:22:56.584
Well, I hope you make
it to where you're going.

1:22:58.086 --> 1:22:59.186
Yeah.

1:22:59.888 --> 1:23:00.789
Thanks.

1:23:04.993 --> 1:23:06.160
You okay?

1:23:07.395 --> 1:23:09.664
Yeah, yeah I'm good.

1:23:10.464 --> 1:23:11.332
Hell, I've been on the road

1:23:11.432 --> 1:23:14.235
for seven years now, I'll be fine.

1:23:20.909 --> 1:23:26.347
Be careful, there's a lot
of dangerous people out there.

1:23:26.682 --> 1:23:27.581
Yeah.

1:23:28.249 --> 1:23:29.350
Yeah, swell.

1:23:31.285 --> 1:23:33.354
Thank you for everything.

1:23:37.591 --> 1:23:40.294
Hey, good luck with your son.

1:23:47.601 --> 1:23:49.905
Good luck finding where you're going.

1:24:03.350 --> 1:24:05.153
To new beginnings.

1:24:11.392 --> 1:24:12.660
New beginnings.

1:24:33.148 --> 1:24:34.916
You got any maps of Colorado?

1:24:35.016 --> 1:24:36.383
Uh, yeah.

1:24:37.418 --> 1:24:39.821
- How much?
- Uh, $2.25.

1:25:20.028 --> 1:25:20.929
Okay.

1:25:23.664 --> 1:25:26.001
I need you to do something for me.

1:25:27.635 --> 1:25:28.536
What?

1:25:31.173 --> 1:25:34.408
I need you to swear to me,
swear you'll get this to Ali.

1:25:34.508 --> 1:25:36.077
What do you mean, "Get this to Ali?"

1:25:36.178 --> 1:25:37.645
If I don't make it.

1:25:37.746 --> 1:25:38.612
You'll make it as long as you

1:25:38.713 --> 1:25:40.414
- keep moving...
- Ben, stop.

1:25:40.514 --> 1:25:43.617
I'm running pretty hard
from some pretty heavy shit.

1:25:43.718 --> 1:25:46.955
- If you get there first.
- First?

1:25:47.055 --> 1:25:50.192
- You've gotta help me.
- I am.

1:25:50.292 --> 1:25:51.559
No, stop, please.

1:25:51.659 --> 1:25:53.762
I got to get to her somehow.

1:25:53.862 --> 1:25:54.963
If not in person,

1:25:56.564 --> 1:26:00.068
if not in person, then by this.

1:26:02.704 --> 1:26:05.439
- Trent, I can't.
- You can.

1:26:05.539 --> 1:26:07.075
You know these roads better than anyone.

1:26:07.175 --> 1:26:10.245
Hell, you're probably the
best person who could do this.

1:26:12.546 --> 1:26:13.514
- I got my own problems...
- Ben.

1:26:13.614 --> 1:26:14.716
I don't need to be screwing up yours.

1:26:14.816 --> 1:26:18.586
Ben, people used me, took from me.

1:26:19.486 --> 1:26:22.389
Maybe that's why I'm
running, but why I'm taking,

1:26:23.859 --> 1:26:27.595
she's never asked for anything
from me, and this is me.

1:26:28.864 --> 1:26:32.466
Even shit as fucked up as
it is, this is who I am.

1:26:34.435 --> 1:26:37.005
Yes, on the run, but I ran into you.

1:26:37.105 --> 1:26:38.907
Maybe there's a reason for this.

1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:42.077
I mean, shit, look, look at us.

1:26:42.978 --> 1:26:45.814
It seems pretty obvious
on this empty road.

1:26:49.184 --> 1:26:50.118
I trust you, Ben.

1:26:59.194 --> 1:27:02.496
All right.

1:27:06.334 --> 1:27:07.869
How do I find her?

1:27:07.969 --> 1:27:10.604
There's a diner, it's on Colfax Avenue.

1:27:10.705 --> 1:27:13.474
Be there at 11:15 am sharp.

1:27:14.309 --> 1:27:15.442
Sit in the far back.

1:27:15.542 --> 1:27:17.779
- Then what?
- Just wait.

1:27:17.879 --> 1:27:20.115
She knows the location and the time.

1:27:21.016 --> 1:27:23.084
And will she know that I'm with you?

1:27:23.885 --> 1:27:27.155
When she gets up to the
table, call her girly.

1:27:28.256 --> 1:27:29.758
She'll know you're with me.

1:27:32.260 --> 1:27:33.161
All right.

1:27:33.929 --> 1:27:36.597
Thank you, I
can't thank you enough.

1:27:38.432 --> 1:27:40.101
Head three miles up that road,

1:27:40.201 --> 1:27:41.770
you'll find that truck stop.

1:27:42.603 --> 1:27:43.437
Good luck.

1:27:52.347 --> 1:27:53.647
Hey, do me a favor.

1:27:55.516 --> 1:27:57.218
Like this isn't enough of one?

1:27:58.720 --> 1:27:59.854
Don't come back.

1:28:01.455 --> 1:28:03.524
Here, out here.

1:28:06.361 --> 1:28:08.629
She doesn't want the chase anymore.

1:28:13.802 --> 1:28:15.236
I'll see you in Denver.

1:28:17.504 --> 1:28:21.076
Hey, you owe me a cup of coffee.

1:28:21.176 --> 1:28:22.609
All right.

1:29:39.487 --> 1:29:40.688
Hey, can I get you something?

1:29:40.789 --> 1:29:42.791
- Oh.
- Other than coffee?

1:29:42.891 --> 1:29:44.926
No, coffee will be just fine, thank you.

1:29:45.026 --> 1:29:47.594
Listen, are you, are you
sure I can't get you something?

1:29:47.695 --> 1:29:49.596
Eggs, some bacon, I'm sure I can

1:29:49.697 --> 1:29:51.232
rustle something up for you.

1:29:51.332 --> 1:29:52.834
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

1:29:54.436 --> 1:29:57.739
Wait, is that clock correct?

1:29:58.973 --> 1:30:00.175
Yes, sir.

1:30:36.511 --> 1:30:37.745
Hey girly.

1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:43.885
If you're reading this, it's
because I wasn't fast enough.

1:30:45.587 --> 1:30:47.255
I'm so sorry for all this.

1:30:48.323 --> 1:30:50.125
I saw a life that was perfect.

1:30:51.593 --> 1:30:52.894
I was actually happy.

1:30:54.329 --> 1:30:57.198
I can honestly say I don't
think I had ever been

1:30:57.298 --> 1:31:01.302
truly happy with my life
until you were a part of it.

1:31:02.370 --> 1:31:06.174
Out of all the mess in my
life, all the wrong, you,

1:31:07.041 --> 1:31:09.711
you were the only thing
that made sense in it.

1:31:10.545 --> 1:31:11.980
I just wanted to get away from the mess,

1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:15.717
get away from the lie I was living.

1:31:16.918 --> 1:31:20.288
I wanted it so bad for us that
I ignored what it would cost.

1:31:21.789 --> 1:31:23.591
What was that risk?

1:31:23.691 --> 1:31:25.160
But you were worth it.

1:31:26.327 --> 1:31:27.929
You are worth it.

1:31:29.663 --> 1:31:31.332
And I need you to keep going.

1:31:31.432 --> 1:31:34.769
You can show me that you
love me by moving forward.

1:31:35.703 --> 1:31:36.838
Live for me.
