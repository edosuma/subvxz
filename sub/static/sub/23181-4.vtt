00:10.200 --> 00:12.600
You're out pickin' stones
with your pals the other day.

00:13.766 --> 00:16.333
Sundays are for
pickin' stones.

00:16.366 --> 00:19.366
KATY: Tale as old as time.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.700
Would you rather pick stones
or pick worms?

00:21.733 --> 00:23.333
Well, pickin' worms is done
at night

00:23.366 --> 00:24.700
and it can gets rather brisk.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.666
So I'd say pickin' stones

00:25.700 --> 00:27.400
'cause it's in the sunshines.

00:27.433 --> 00:30.100
There's been an incident
and I'd like to talk about it.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.233
Get after it.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.200
Well, Pitter‐Patter,
let's get at 'er.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.300
Spit it out, big shoots.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.633
I seen Stewart's horn.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.633
What?

00:43.666 --> 00:45.600
‐You seen his impaler?
‐His bobby dangler?

00:45.633 --> 00:47.433
‐Well...
‐You seen his PhD?

00:47.466 --> 00:49.333
‐His WMD?
‐Now, look, fellas...

00:49.366 --> 00:51.433
‐You seen his friendly weapon?
‐His sticky grenade?

00:51.466 --> 00:52.566
His ground squirrel?

00:52.600 --> 00:53.566
Yeah, I seen
his ground squirrel.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.200
You seen
Stewart's middle stump?

00:55.233 --> 00:56.700
You've seen
his custard slinger?

00:56.733 --> 00:58.200
Well, I'm comin' up the stairs

00:58.233 --> 00:59.200
and he's comin'
out of the bathroom

00:59.233 --> 01:00.800
just naked as a jay bird
for some fuckin' reason.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.466
I round the corner and, yeah,

01:02.500 --> 01:03.566
‐so I seen his, uh...
‐His hollow point.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.666
DAN: His hard drive.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.033
Well, his floppy disk
is what I seen, yeah.

01:08.066 --> 01:10.300
‐Well, what's the evaluation?
‐Yeah.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.400
I'd hear an assessment.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.633
You wanna know what?

01:16.666 --> 01:18.366
Looked like a tall boy can
of Red Bull hangin' there.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.033
No.

01:20.066 --> 01:21.433
Looked like a tube
of tennis balls hangin' there.

01:21.466 --> 01:23.233
‐A four‐pack.
‐Shut up.

01:23.266 --> 01:24.533
Looked like a fuckin'
policeman's flashlight

01:24.566 --> 01:25.733
from the 1980s hangin' there.

01:25.766 --> 01:26.666
You're joking.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.500
That is no joke.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.133
DARYL: Good job, Stewart.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.533
That's what I said.
I said, good for him.

01:33.566 --> 01:35.033
Good for you, Stewart.

01:35.066 --> 01:36.166
Like I'm happy for him.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.433
Yeah, it's really good
for him.

01:37.466 --> 01:38.466
Well, it's
a terrific opportunity.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.033
Good for you, Stewart.

01:41.066 --> 01:42.466
KATY: Pump the brakes.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.766
Stewart isn't
a really big dude.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.433
Are you sure the size
of his horn

01:45.466 --> 01:47.600
wasn't accentuated
by his really tiny frame?

01:49.800 --> 01:51.500
Looked like a one‐liter
thermos hangin' there.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.566
Because... Because, you know,
a really big dude

01:55.600 --> 01:58.100
can have a massive horn,
but it would look really small

01:58.133 --> 02:00.066
in proportion
to his gigantic frame, right?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.433
Have you been
reading my diary?

02:01.466 --> 02:02.600
I'll tell you what,
it looked like

02:02.633 --> 02:03.533
a deflated football
hangin' there.

02:04.466 --> 02:05.400
KATY: Fuck!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.133
You wanna know what?

02:10.166 --> 02:11.800
There's such a thing
as too much horn talk

02:11.833 --> 02:13.633
and a fella ought
to be fuckin' aware of it.

and Boots now.

did not fuck an ostrich.

two ostriches.

07:25.433 --> 07:26.800
Allegedly.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.400
Folks'll say that it takes
two people to fuck an ostrich.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.033
Three even.

07:31.066 --> 07:33.066
Folks are also saying
that it was a sick ostrich.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.366
Allegedly.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.333
WAYNE: Now, I went
on the Internet

07:35.366 --> 07:37.066
and researched ostriches.

07:37.100 --> 07:40.300
Firstly, ostriches can run up
to 70 miles an hour.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.700
So catching one,

07:41.733 --> 07:44.200
even a sick one,
is a super tall order.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.333
Yeah, but there
was two of them.

07:45.366 --> 07:47.666
Secondly, when
a male ostrich,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.800
it's called a cock,

07:49.833 --> 07:51.600
fights over
a female ostrich,

07:51.633 --> 07:53.200
they're called a hen,

07:53.233 --> 07:54.400
they're known
to kill each other

07:54.433 --> 07:56.100
by head butting.

07:56.133 --> 07:57.500
Probably should
wear hockey helmets.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.166
Hockey helmets, buddy.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.800
Well, they'd need
a race car helmet, likely.

08:00.833 --> 08:04.600
Finally, ostriches use their
legs to defend from predators.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.666
And can use them to kill even
their largest

08:06.700 --> 08:09.633
and most deadly enemies,
which are fuckin' lions.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.033
That's the king of the jungle.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.466
Still just a cat.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.766
So you'll see there is no way

08:14.800 --> 08:17.400
the Ginger and Boots
could have fucked an ostrich.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.200
Maybe they tranqed
the ostrich.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.133
Like they roofie'd
the ostrich?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.566
WAYNE: You wanna know what?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.300
You should feel bad about
even suggesting

08:23.333 --> 08:24.800
that the Ginger and Boots
fucked an ostrich.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.666
Bad gas travels real fast
in a small town.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.233
My research concludes

08:29.266 --> 08:30.766
that the only way
the Ginger and Boots

08:30.800 --> 08:34.500
could have fucked an ostrich
is if it was a dead ostrich.

08:34.533 --> 08:38.200
Ginger and Boots (HORN HONKS)
a dead ostrich?

08:38.233 --> 08:41.400
I thought it was just sick!
Oh, my! Ginny?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.666
The Ginger and Boots
effed a dead ostrich.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.133
Oh, bother.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.766
Of course I know what the male
ones are called!

08:46.800 --> 08:47.633
Check my browser history.

08:50.871 --> 08:53.104
(MUSIC PLAYING)

09:00.438 --> 09:01.971
Don't show
her weakness, Stewart.

09:02.004 --> 09:03.138
I'm not. I'm sun burnt.

09:05.304 --> 09:07.404
‐Hey, you!
‐Hey, you.

09:07.438 --> 09:08.838
This is awkward but your shirt
seems to have

09:08.871 --> 09:10.438
‐shrunk in the wash.
‐Not awkward.

09:10.471 --> 09:12.838
Things shrink in the wash.
How do you explain your dick?

09:12.871 --> 09:14.771
Quick wit. Valuable asset.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.904
Must really serve a lady
of the night like you well.

09:16.938 --> 09:19.038
‐He means you're a hooker.
‐Thanks, Roald. You speak?

09:19.071 --> 09:21.338
(HISSES)

09:21.371 --> 09:22.938
Heard a song this morning
that reminded me of you.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.138
Really? So cool. What was it?

09:25.171 --> 09:27.871
‐Die, Die, My Darling.
‐Metallica. Love 'em.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.904
Actually, they have a song
that reminds me of you, too.

09:29.938 --> 09:31.371
‐Oh?
‐Yeah.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.238
‐Sad But True.
‐Hmm.

09:34.271 --> 09:36.738
Why don't you run along
and get your essentials?

09:36.771 --> 09:40.704
You know, long, smooth,
cylindrical‐shaped objects.

09:40.738 --> 09:41.804
Actually, I'm just looking
for some

09:41.838 --> 09:43.971
three‐inch screws
to hang a frame.

09:44.004 --> 09:47.404
Hey, you know what three
inches looks like, right?

09:50.738 --> 09:52.938
‐She skewered you!
‐Don't listen to him, Devon.

09:52.971 --> 09:55.071
They wanted you
to go to debate school.

09:55.904 --> 09:57.071
(MOUTHING)

10:04.838 --> 10:05.804
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

10:08.438 --> 10:11.104
Hey, what's up?

10:11.138 --> 10:13.738
‐We... We're just goin'...
‐Kidding! I don't give a fuck.

10:13.771 --> 10:15.138
Look like you got a bad case
of the native flu.

10:15.171 --> 10:17.071
Should've brought
your fuckin' bodyguards.

10:17.104 --> 10:19.704
We do not
have the native flu, okay!

10:19.738 --> 10:20.704
It's not the native flu!

10:20.738 --> 10:22.004
Right.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.171
And one tit's better than two.

10:24.204 --> 10:27.204
Tanis, what we want to do
is go inside,

10:27.238 --> 10:30.038
rip a couple of snap bombs
and then go home.

10:30.071 --> 10:32.671
Just wanna rip some snaps
and bury some claps, Tanis.

10:32.704 --> 10:34.838
Hack some limbs
and rack some PIMS.

10:34.871 --> 10:36.138
Lay beats and fill seats.

10:36.171 --> 10:37.438
Yeah? Yous want
to get pucks deep?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.204
‐Get pucks deep.
‐Yeah, get pucks in the net.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.971
Shut the fuck up.

10:41.004 --> 10:42.138
If yous think you're gonna
make it into that rink,

10:42.171 --> 10:43.871
you're fuckin' stupid.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.071
Do some damage, boys!

10:48.871 --> 10:49.971
Wa'tsok.

10:52.938 --> 10:55.238
Listen, we're four lines deep

10:55.271 --> 10:57.171
of BFI's in there ready
to speed bag you space men.

10:57.204 --> 10:58.404
What's a BFI?

10:58.438 --> 11:00.838
Big Fuckin' Indians.

11:00.871 --> 11:03.438
Not sure that's PC
but you said it.

11:03.471 --> 11:05.004
If you chodes walk
out of there

11:05.038 --> 11:06.438
with all your chicklets,
then I'm a fuckin' ferret.

11:06.471 --> 11:07.638
Piss off.

11:08.138 --> 11:09.138
Cool.

11:10.371 --> 11:11.271
That's not cool.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.338
You ready for a chin check?

11:14.938 --> 11:16.038
Yup.

11:17.104 --> 11:18.138
You can avoid it
if you want to.

11:19.238 --> 11:20.071
Nope.

11:20.871 --> 11:21.971
Hmm...

11:23.738 --> 11:25.071
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:32.771 --> 11:34.271
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

11:34.304 --> 11:35.404
I want the ban
on Letterkenny lifted.

11:36.704 --> 11:37.838
There's some good money

11:37.871 --> 11:38.938
that can be made
selling smokes there.

11:40.338 --> 11:42.004
Yous made your point.
We fucked off.

11:42.038 --> 11:43.204
Point's not made yet.

11:43.238 --> 11:44.371
It's not calculus.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.838
Finite math is worse.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.738
Trigonometry fucked me.

11:47.771 --> 11:50.238
I forgot long division
in grade six.

11:50.271 --> 11:53.671
Okay. Lift the ban
on Letterkenny.

11:53.704 --> 11:55.171
We'll make a buck
and yous can cruise the rez.

11:55.204 --> 11:56.938
‐Bags of darts?
‐Yeah, go to the casino.

11:56.971 --> 11:58.138
Venison pepperettes?

11:58.171 --> 12:00.671
Yes. Go watch a fuckin'
hockey game.

12:00.704 --> 12:02.638
WAYNE: Mmm...

12:04.738 --> 12:05.871
Nope.

12:16.204 --> 12:17.804
FBIs coming.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.771
‐Who's that?
‐Fuckin' Big Indians!

12:23.304 --> 12:25.704
Now, one of yous farted right
before she got here

12:25.738 --> 12:27.738
and she
definitely thought it was me.

12:27.771 --> 12:28.838
‐Dan?
‐I'd admits it.

12:28.871 --> 12:30.071
JB?

12:30.104 --> 12:32.004
Would've went out my window.

12:32.038 --> 12:33.804
Maybe she farted.

12:33.838 --> 12:35.771
(GIGGLES) It was me.

12:37.871 --> 12:40.171
Hey, since when did algebra
become a quick wank?

12:40.204 --> 12:41.904
I once popped
my grade nine math teacher

12:41.938 --> 12:43.971
over the Pythagorean theorem.

12:44.004 --> 12:46.038
‐Did you get expelled?
‐Just suspended.

12:46.071 --> 12:48.338
Yep, called probability
and statistics.

12:48.371 --> 12:50.004
Like probably never gonna
need them

12:50.038 --> 12:51.204
statistics in your whole life.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.738
That's kind of like fractions.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.071
Like multiplying
and dividing them.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.671
Like who the fuck's
doin' that?

12:55.704 --> 12:58.171
My friend David does tool
and dye and he uses fractions.

12:58.204 --> 13:00.004
Should have
just got his fridge ticket.

13:00.038 --> 13:01.404
David has his fridge ticket.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.038
Then he should
just drive truck.

13:03.071 --> 13:04.104
Well, it's never too late
to drive truck.

13:05.771 --> 13:07.004
Oh!

13:08.804 --> 13:10.038
Eyelash. Make a wish.

13:11.938 --> 13:13.371
Wish you weren't
so fuckin' awkward, bud.

13:17.238 --> 13:18.304
TANIS: Five minutes!

13:19.704 --> 13:20.738
Yup.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.371
‐You ready, bro?
‐Born ready, buddy.

13:26.404 --> 13:27.704
You stretch it out, bro?

13:27.738 --> 13:29.238
Good and limber, bro.

13:29.271 --> 13:30.104
I say we get a couple
of shifts in

13:30.138 --> 13:31.738
before we answer the bell.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.238
Get a couple of shifts in
before tea time.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.738
Get that first shot in
and just keep goin', buddy.

13:34.771 --> 13:35.871
Don't hesitate, buddy.

13:35.904 --> 13:37.038
Take a shift, schmelts.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.771
Ooh!

15:08.104 --> 15:09.871
Pulled salad in the scrum.

15:09.904 --> 15:11.671
Got a mitt full, boys.

15:11.704 --> 15:13.304
You get any good shots in?

15:13.338 --> 15:15.038
Think I was on my feet
for a bit there, bro.

15:16.404 --> 15:18.838
Hey, are you hurt
or are you injured?

15:18.871 --> 15:20.304
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

15:27.071 --> 15:28.871
Ah! Don't...

15:34.904 --> 15:36.738
100% pure organic,

15:36.771 --> 15:38.938
grass‐fed,
Triple A Alberta beef.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.104
Better believe
it's 'Berta beef.

15:40.138 --> 15:41.771
What you got there?
Top sirloins?

15:41.804 --> 15:43.004
Yeah, the New Yorks
are grain‐fed.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.938
Three times the omega‐3's
in grass‐fed.

15:44.971 --> 15:46.371
Bought and paid for.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.771
Well, you're gonna want 'em
aged if they're top sirloins.

15:48.804 --> 15:50.004
Pump the brakes.

15:50.038 --> 15:51.338
Two things. One.

15:51.371 --> 15:53.071
We'll let those sit for
10 to 15 minutes

15:53.104 --> 15:54.304
till they're room temperature.

15:54.338 --> 15:55.838
Two. Where's the
salt and pepper, bud?

15:55.871 --> 15:57.004
Don't you fuckin' start.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.704
S and P, the choice for me.

15:58.738 --> 16:00.204
I paid a C‐hair just
shy of 20

16:00.238 --> 16:01.438
for each of these C‐suckers

16:01.471 --> 16:03.671
and I will not be told
how to cook 'em.

16:03.704 --> 16:04.938
You paid 20 apiece
for 'Berta beef?

16:04.971 --> 16:06.704
‐Only 'Berta beef.
‐Well, no guff.

16:06.738 --> 16:08.704
But I wouldn't pay 20
apiece for Japanese wagyu.

16:08.738 --> 16:10.271
‐Always 'Berta beef.
‐Hard yes.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.838
But I wouldn't pay 20
apiece for Australian wagyu.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.738
Gonna want a rib eye
if it's a wagyu.

16:14.771 --> 16:15.904
One‐inch thick top sirloin.

16:15.938 --> 16:17.338
Grill at 400.

16:17.371 --> 16:19.004
Four minutes a side.
Down the hatch.

16:19.038 --> 16:20.971
‐You are fuckin' up, bud.
‐That's textbook.

16:21.004 --> 16:22.671
Not without the S and P.

16:22.704 --> 16:24.438
Those fine ranchers
in Alberta'd be a C‐hair away

16:24.471 --> 16:25.738
from not sendin' it here
if they knew you were

16:25.771 --> 16:27.671
sprinklin' salt all over
the C‐suckers.

16:27.704 --> 16:28.738
You're a C‐hair away
from gettin'

16:28.771 --> 16:30.104
C‐suckin' socked, good buddy.

16:30.138 --> 16:31.271
Montreal steak spice really

16:31.304 --> 16:32.738
should be a part
of this conversation.

16:32.771 --> 16:34.271
One‐inch
thick top sirloin steak.

16:34.304 --> 16:35.738
Salt and pepper heavily.

16:35.771 --> 16:37.838
Grill at 400.
Four minutes total.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.871
Flip each minute
to get the good grill marks.

16:39.904 --> 16:41.904
Let sit for two minutes.
Down the hatch.

16:41.938 --> 16:43.438
‐Flip twice.
‐Grill marks, bud.

16:43.471 --> 16:45.304
‐Sacrilege.
‐I will strike you.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.971
‐Blasphemy.
‐Do you wanna get striked?

16:47.004 --> 16:48.138
Finish the whole thing off

16:48.171 --> 16:49.404
with a real nice herbs
and garlics butter.

16:49.438 --> 16:51.704
Don't fuck up
my steak dinner, Dary!

16:51.738 --> 16:53.104
Any decent chef will tell you,

16:53.138 --> 16:54.738
you don't even want to let
those things touch the grill.

16:54.771 --> 16:56.104
Make it dryer than a fart.

16:56.138 --> 16:57.371
What ya wanna do, pan sear it,

16:57.404 --> 16:58.704
both sides,
finish her off in the ovens.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.371
Well, see, now that sounds
like over‐handling to me.

17:03.404 --> 17:05.104
You'd be over‐handling them,
Squirrelly Dan.

17:05.138 --> 17:06.704
Well, he'd be
Squirrelly Dan'dling.

17:06.738 --> 17:08.938
Oh, yeah, me and Gordon Ramsay
are both morons.

17:08.971 --> 17:11.371
You wanna know what?
Meet half way.

17:11.404 --> 17:14.138
All right,
no S and P, flip twice.

17:14.171 --> 17:16.171
‐Good. Rare to medium rare.
‐Medium rare.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.904
TANIS: Yo!

17:19.938 --> 17:21.238
Ding, ding, pink dicks.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.404
This one's mine.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.204
Throw them steaks on, Dary,
this won't take long.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.938
Oh!

17:38.804 --> 17:39.904
(GROANS)

17:41.271 --> 17:43.071
Remember me, boys?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.304
Where's that 'Berta beef?

17:45.404 --> 17:46.338
Grill marks, bud.

17:49.871 --> 17:52.004
That's the two‐fight rule
for the win, boys.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.704
Two fights,
that's your night, buddy.

17:53.738 --> 17:56.204
Hmm. Hey, did you get
any good shots in?

17:56.238 --> 17:58.071
No good ones, bro.

17:58.104 --> 17:58.971
He fish‐hooked me,

17:59.004 --> 18:00.838
so I chomped his finger.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.238
He gave me
a pretty good seatbelt,

18:02.271 --> 18:04.804
so I pinched the shit out
of the back of his arm, buddy.

18:04.838 --> 18:06.038
I fuckin' hate
when that happens.

18:06.071 --> 18:06.971
He did too, buddy.

18:07.804 --> 18:09.771
Hey.

18:09.804 --> 18:12.038
We would have dusted them
if they hadn't jumped us.

18:12.071 --> 18:13.204
Proper dustin', ferda.

18:15.004 --> 18:16.138
(GRUNTING)

18:18.371 --> 18:19.704
REILLY: Oh, shit!
Fuck, buddy.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.671
We would have dusted them
if they didn't jump us.

18:27.704 --> 18:29.371
Proper dustin', ferda.

18:36.371 --> 18:38.404
Hey, shirt‐tucker!

18:38.438 --> 18:40.038
That doesn't really narrow
it down.

18:41.470 --> 18:43.270
You. Meet me half way.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.437
I'll level with you.
We have a BFI on stand‐by

18:53.470 --> 18:55.037
‐that will fuck you up.
‐K.

18:55.070 --> 18:56.337
‐He'll lynch you.
‐Good.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.037
‐He'll end you.
‐That's redundant.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.570
You can end this
if you lift the ban.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.970
You burned down
our produce stand, Tanis.

19:02.004 --> 19:03.570
(CHUCKLES)

19:03.604 --> 19:05.137
Listen. I don't want
to call him.

19:05.170 --> 19:06.304
‐You can call him.
‐Yeah, but I don't want to.

19:06.337 --> 19:07.437
Ah, give him a call.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.937
I'd rather work this out
with you.

19:08.970 --> 19:09.637
‐Too much talk.
‐Wait, wait, wait!

19:11.170 --> 19:12.570
(SIGHS)

19:12.604 --> 19:14.337
We're having a really
hard time on the rez, okay?

19:14.370 --> 19:16.104
And selling cigarettes

19:16.137 --> 19:17.670
in Letterkenny
really helps us out.

19:17.704 --> 19:19.204
And all of the money goes
back into the community.

19:21.970 --> 19:23.504
This dude
doesn't exist, does he?

19:25.204 --> 19:26.570
I want you to meet someone.

19:28.137 --> 19:29.404
Dustin!

19:38.104 --> 19:40.104
We don't have a lot of money.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.137
And I'd sure like
to play baseball.

19:42.170 --> 19:43.570
Please lift the ban, Wayne.

19:43.604 --> 19:45.237
You can get a glove for free
at the Sally Anne.

19:45.270 --> 19:47.537
Just have Mom or Dad drive
you down there.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.337
(CLICKS TONGUE) Don't, uh...

19:49.370 --> 19:50.604
Don't care much
for kids, so...

19:51.504 --> 19:52.604
Bubba Wally!

20:06.170 --> 20:08.470
The cupboards are bare
in the elders' lodge.

20:08.504 --> 20:10.537
And we're so tired and sore.

20:10.570 --> 20:11.937
Please lift the ban, Wayne.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.237
I've got plenty of fresh
produce on the farm.

20:13.270 --> 20:14.604
Yous are welcome to it.

20:16.570 --> 20:17.637
Lego!

20:29.204 --> 20:30.604
Oh, fuck...

20:31.404 --> 20:32.604
A three‐legged dog.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.270
And look, Wayne,
another three‐legged dog.

20:46.270 --> 20:47.404
It's cute, huh?

20:54.237 --> 20:55.470
Yous can come
back once per week.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.104
Saturday mornings. Set up shop

20:57.137 --> 20:58.370
in the farmers'
market parking lot.

20:58.404 --> 20:59.504
We'll spread the word.

21:01.604 --> 21:02.470
Nia‐wen.

21:04.070 --> 21:05.604
Does this dude exist or not?

21:06.537 --> 21:07.604
Mmm.

21:14.270 --> 21:15.710
Pitter‐Patter!

21:18.805 --> 21:20.171
(MUSIC PLAYING)

21:26.136 --> 21:27.703
Hey, Katy.
Carrying lunch there?

21:27.736 --> 21:30.470
Yeah. You want a bite?

21:30.503 --> 21:32.603
Who's this?
He looks just like you.

21:32.636 --> 21:34.236
You actually
look great today,

21:34.270 --> 21:36.436
you know, in comparison
to this bag of shit.

21:36.470 --> 21:37.703
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

21:37.736 --> 21:39.570
‐So?
‐So?

21:39.603 --> 21:40.670
Still an unapologetically
promiscuous tart?

21:40.703 --> 21:43.036
Yep. Still a heartbreakingly

21:43.070 --> 21:44.636
inadequate
chronic masturbator?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.403
‐No!
‐Hi, Roald.

21:46.436 --> 21:50.070
‐Whatever!
‐Stewart,

21:50.103 --> 21:51.603
you and I were a bad idea.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.603
(SCOFFS) Evident.

21:55.736 --> 21:56.636
But I still think you're cool.

21:59.136 --> 21:59.970
Adios.

22:06.436 --> 22:07.570
Hey, Devon.

22:08.803 --> 22:10.103
Ugh!

22:10.136 --> 22:11.070
Want a bite?

22:21.336 --> 22:23.303
So what say that dude exists?

22:23.336 --> 22:25.170
He doesn't.

22:25.203 --> 22:26.636
Yeah, but what say
that he did?

22:26.670 --> 22:28.270
What if he walks up and hoofs

22:28.303 --> 22:29.570
you right in the nuts
like Joint Boy?

22:29.603 --> 22:31.436
JB's right, it's him or you.

22:31.470 --> 22:33.370
But a kick
in the undercarriage?

22:33.403 --> 22:35.503
Did Tanis ever recover
when I hoofed her?

22:35.536 --> 22:36.670
I think she kind of did...

22:36.703 --> 22:38.370
Just kiddin'.
I don't give a fuck.

22:38.403 --> 22:40.503
You still sweet on her,
though, Dary?

22:40.536 --> 22:43.003
‐No.
‐Why?

22:43.036 --> 22:45.136
Bonnie McMurray, that's why.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.103
You're sweet
on Bonnie McMurray?

22:47.136 --> 22:49.470
‐Oh, you bet I am.
‐Ha. Same.

22:49.503 --> 22:51.303
Well, it's no
fuckin' mystery, Murdoch.

22:51.336 --> 22:52.470
Better to be the dude doin'

22:52.503 --> 22:54.070
the hoofin'
than the dude gettin' hoofed.

22:54.103 --> 22:55.470
Or the girl gettin' hoofed.

22:55.503 --> 22:57.236
Exhibit A. Tanis.

22:57.270 --> 22:59.036
But a kicks in the cojones?

22:59.070 --> 23:00.236
Well, it's too late once
you've been hoofed

23:00.270 --> 23:01.336
in the nuts, isn't it?

23:01.370 --> 23:02.470
You stand there holdin'
your ball sack

23:02.503 --> 23:04.170
wondering why
you didn't hoof first.

23:04.203 --> 23:05.236
Or you stand there holdin'
your box

23:05.270 --> 23:06.770
wondering why
you never hoofed first.

23:06.803 --> 23:10.236
So what you're sayings
is if that dudes existed...

23:10.270 --> 23:11.170
We've already established

23:11.203 --> 23:13.770
the dude doesn't fuckin'
exist, have we not?

23:13.803 --> 23:15.170
You'd kick him right
in the pills?

23:15.203 --> 23:16.703
I'm fuckin' irritated.

23:16.736 --> 23:19.103
Would you kick him right
in the pillbox?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.403
I'm gonna go see
what's on television.

23:21.436 --> 23:23.603
We're just speakin'
hypo‐ethically here, bud.

23:25.303 --> 23:26.670
Ain't no reason
to get upset, Wayne!

23:52.191 --> 23:53.824
TANIS: Save me an Indian taco.

24:00.824 --> 24:03.857
‐How're you now?
‐Does the dude exist or not?

24:03.891 --> 24:06.591
No. Yous worked
through our finest.

24:06.624 --> 24:08.691
No one else measures up. Yet.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.957
‐Stay for a barbecue?
‐No, thank you.

24:11.991 --> 24:13.024
TANIS: Stay.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.991
‐What are yous cookin'?
‐Wagyu.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.124
‐Wagyu?
‐Wagyu New York.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.491
I was told you should go for
the rib‐eye if it's a wagyu.

24:25.524 --> 24:27.157
‐Duh.
‐How you cookin 'em?

24:27.191 --> 24:28.624
One‐inch thick wagyu,
New Yorks.

24:28.657 --> 24:30.024
Heavily salt and peppered.

24:30.057 --> 24:32.024
Grill at 400.
Four minutes total.

24:32.057 --> 24:36.591
Flip once a minute for those
good grill marks.

24:36.624 --> 24:40.591
Let sit for two minutes
and then down the hatch.

24:40.624 --> 24:41.524
Flip once a minute, eh?

24:45.557 --> 24:46.724
Grill marks, bud.

24:49.491 --> 24:50.524
Grill marks, bud.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.757
