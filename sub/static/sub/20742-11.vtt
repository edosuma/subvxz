<i>Previously on The Bridge...</i>

00:04.197 --> 00:05.781
Where are we going?

00:06.814 --> 00:09.097
Hello? Hello?

00:10.719 --> 00:11.919
Gus is alive.

00:11.987 --> 00:13.221
Why do you say that?

00:13.288 --> 00:14.747
He wants Marco to suffer.

00:14.829 --> 00:16.729
What would you do
if someone hurt your son?

00:24.669 --> 00:26.200
Daniel Frye is missing.

00:26.268 --> 00:28.268
Daniel helped cover up
the hit-and-run.

00:28.336 --> 00:29.570
David Tate's family.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.506
He told me. That's why he's
been targeted all this time.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.742
Leave him alone.
Take it out on me.

00:34.809 --> 00:36.877
Well, isn't that what I'm doing?

00:36.945 --> 00:38.045
Come alone.

00:38.113 --> 00:40.014
Entirely alone.
Leave her.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.749
Don't tell anyone where I went.

00:41.816 --> 00:42.683
Hey, where's Marco?

00:42.751 --> 00:44.352
He got a call and left.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.919
Got a call from who?

00:45.987 --> 00:47.288
You have a gun?

00:47.356 --> 00:48.422
Yes.

00:48.490 --> 00:49.923
Good.

00:49.991 --> 00:52.042
I'll drive.

00:58.233 --> 00:59.733
Shoot him.

01:01.416 --> 01:02.826
Thought you said
we were gonna scare him.

01:02.861 --> 01:03.853
Well, I changed my mind.

01:03.888 --> 01:04.977
No, whoa, whoa...

Hello.

01:54.089 --> 01:55.807
<i>Hola.</i>

01:56.758 --> 01:58.492
Anyone around?

02:08.737 --> 02:12.340
Oh. Man!

02:17.779 --> 02:19.662
Oh, shit.

02:19.763 --> 02:21.773
Holy shit!

02:33.562 --> 02:35.896
What the hell?

02:40.902 --> 02:42.803
Stay cool, bro.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.773
Stay cool, bro, stay cool.

02:57.085 --> 03:00.421
I'm just gonna borrow this, Pedro.

03:25.314 --> 03:27.748
What the f...?

05:58.007 --> 05:59.608
Your papers, <i>señor</i>.

05:59.676 --> 06:00.942
Here you go.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.347
For my wife, it was instant.

06:11.021 --> 06:12.787
I know what you're thinking.

06:12.855 --> 06:14.560
Don't.

06:15.557 --> 06:18.594
I just want my son back.

06:18.661 --> 06:22.431
My son lived for ten minutes
after the crash.

06:23.071 --> 06:25.700
His name was Caleb.
Do you remember that?

06:25.868 --> 06:27.336
I'm sorry, David.

06:27.403 --> 06:29.840
I'm sorry you lost your son.

06:31.774 --> 06:33.635
Thank you.

06:40.082 --> 06:42.784
I imagine him there.
Under the car.

06:42.852 --> 06:44.619
Crushed.
Unable to breathe.

06:44.787 --> 06:46.655
Please, David.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.524
I always hoped
he was already gone, you know.

06:49.592 --> 06:51.601
In his head.

06:52.094 --> 06:54.311
Daydreaming about something nice.

06:54.344 --> 06:56.317
Something warm and safe.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.600
But I have a feeling,

06:58.637 --> 07:00.649
down in the utter bottom
of myself,

07:00.687 --> 07:02.662
that it wasn't like that
for him.

07:02.905 --> 07:05.408
I think it was like dying

07:05.575 --> 07:07.942
in a cold, dark place.
Alone.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.511
Waiting for me to save him.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.480
It was an accident, David.

07:11.547 --> 07:13.348
But I never showed up.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.065
He died alone.

07:16.386 --> 07:18.287
Right about here, in fact.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.692
What are you doing?

07:25.060 --> 07:26.561
Here we go.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.334
What are you doing, David?

07:41.276 --> 07:43.278
You ready, Marco?

07:50.486 --> 07:51.420
Get back.

07:51.487 --> 07:52.421
Go back!

07:52.488 --> 07:53.422
Back.

07:53.489 --> 07:54.656
Everybody back.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.490
<i>Tiene una bomba!</i>

07:55.558 --> 07:56.558
He's got a bomb!

07:56.626 --> 07:57.559
Back!

08:12.442 --> 08:14.843
Blowing up the bridge
won't solve anything.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.996
- Well, it depends.
- On what?

08:21.283 --> 08:23.869
You still want
to see your son, right?

08:26.488 --> 08:29.108
I need to hear you say it,
Marco.

08:30.025 --> 08:31.292
Yes.

08:31.361 --> 08:32.894
I want to see my son!

08:48.878 --> 08:50.723
Then let's get started.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.202
Open the trunk.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.712
Frye.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.305
Get him out.

09:05.528 --> 09:07.829
Come here.

09:14.670 --> 09:15.604
Ah!

09:29.552 --> 09:31.018
You shouldn't be here.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.096
You should be at the hospital.

09:35.024 --> 09:37.426
I need to find Gus.

09:41.731 --> 09:44.184
So, Marco's with Tate,
isn't he?

09:48.238 --> 09:50.196
Answer me, Sonya.

09:50.950 --> 09:52.576
Yes.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.820
He went to meet him.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.307
So you decided not to tell me.

09:58.448 --> 10:00.766
In fact, you lied to me.

10:02.552 --> 10:04.719
I'm sorry.

10:45.495 --> 10:47.124
Sonya, what is it?

10:47.159 --> 10:48.887
I think I know where he is.

10:48.922 --> 10:51.365
I have to go back
to Walter Chambers' house.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.167
Sonya, we've been all over that.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.135
There ain't nothin' there.

10:54.203 --> 10:56.170
I know,
but we're missing something.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.171
Well, what'd we miss?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.573
That son of a bitch

10:58.641 --> 11:00.533
has Marco
on the Bridge of the Americas.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.507
And he's got a bomb.

11:03.378 --> 11:05.725
- Is Gus with them?
- No, but Daniel Frye is.

11:05.803 --> 11:08.667
- He's gonna kill them both.
- No, it doesn't fit.

11:08.744 --> 11:10.896
Gus is part of this, too.

11:14.323 --> 11:15.790
I'm going to Chambers' house.

11:15.858 --> 11:17.058
Cooper, go with her

11:17.126 --> 11:18.226
I'll be at the bridge.

11:18.293 --> 11:19.561
Call me if you find anything.

11:19.629 --> 11:20.461
Yes, sir.

11:20.530 --> 11:22.430
- I need a gun.
- I have several.

11:22.498 --> 11:24.599
Frye's always been
a part of Tate's game.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.867
The bomb, the phone calls.

11:25.935 --> 11:26.968
I'm guessing Marco is, too.

11:27.036 --> 11:29.137
Ooh, I'm not gonna comment
on that.

11:29.204 --> 11:30.471
Hey, we found Frye.

11:30.540 --> 11:31.406
We're done here.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.474
Lieutenant,
can I come with you?

11:33.543 --> 11:35.410
What, for Fry or the story?

11:35.477 --> 11:36.244
For both.

11:36.311 --> 11:37.983
No. You'll be in the way.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.581
Please.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.129
Aw, hell.

11:58.668 --> 12:00.125
What the hell's going...

12:00.260 --> 12:01.424
What the hell's going on?

12:01.537 --> 12:03.159
You know, Daniel.

12:03.673 --> 12:05.876
This is the end of your life.

12:06.182 --> 12:08.430
Let him go.
This is between you and I!

12:08.465 --> 12:10.330
Oh, Daniel is a part of it.

12:10.846 --> 12:13.671
A big part...
aren't you, Daniel?

12:16.051 --> 12:18.653
- You're crazy, Tate.
- Maybe.

12:18.721 --> 12:20.569
But all you had to do
was tell the truth.

12:20.623 --> 12:22.935
That's what a journalist does.

12:23.693 --> 12:25.609
But you didn't do that.

12:27.597 --> 12:30.122
Over there, both of you.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.454
Come on. Come on.

12:42.777 --> 12:45.623
This is all about getting
those two men off the bridge alive.

12:45.658 --> 12:46.922
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

12:46.926 --> 12:48.552
Good. Then keep your mouth shut
and stay out of my way.

12:48.623 --> 12:50.346
I got a job to do.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.354
- He made any demands yet?
- Not yet.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.502
- Got snipers in position?
- Yes.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.038
- Good. You got a shot?
- Yes, sir.

13:07.636 --> 13:09.523
If this vest I'm wearing
detonates,

13:09.602 --> 13:14.248
it'll tear apart me, you, Frye
and most of the center of the bridge.

13:14.476 --> 13:17.592
Okay.
You're in control, David.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.920
I've got a shot. On your call.

13:26.088 --> 13:27.772
No, hang-hang on.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.300
Bomb's live.

13:31.126 --> 13:32.761
Have your sniper stand down.

13:32.828 --> 13:35.114
He's activated
the dead man's switch.

13:35.330 --> 13:36.359
Hold your fire.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.533
Hold your fire.

13:39.802 --> 13:43.104
He's engaged the vest.
He is in control now.

13:43.172 --> 13:44.757
What's happening?

13:45.107 --> 13:47.976
There is no good outcome here.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.442
None.

13:52.514 --> 13:55.684
My thumb comes off
this trigger, we all die...

13:55.751 --> 13:58.086
and so does any hope
of saving Gus.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.716
Just-just do whatever
you have to do

14:00.849 --> 14:02.547
and tell me where my son is!

14:02.725 --> 14:06.267
And-and stop with all
these bullshit games!

14:19.909 --> 14:21.976
Take out your gun.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.852
Good. Now point it at him.

14:50.872 --> 14:52.986
What the hell's he doing?

14:54.876 --> 14:56.957
- Mar...
- Daniel.

15:02.051 --> 15:05.920
Your son is dying, Marco,
right now.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.856
You have a choice to make.

15:07.923 --> 15:10.158
Where is my son?

15:13.562 --> 15:15.263
Consequences, Marco.

15:39.955 --> 15:41.122
Daniel Frye,

15:41.190 --> 15:44.225
a waste of a human being,
dies... your son lives.

15:44.293 --> 15:46.835
I think most fathers
would take that bet.

15:47.496 --> 15:48.296
Then maybe you'd go to jail.

15:48.363 --> 15:52.038
Maybe it's Juarez,
and they look the other way.

15:52.946 --> 15:56.838
But you have your son,
and life goes on for him.

15:58.808 --> 16:01.005
Now, kill him.

16:07.249 --> 16:08.917
I'm not gonna do that!

16:08.984 --> 16:11.585
Kill him, save Gus.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.125
No.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.396
Gus is dying, Marco.

16:22.464 --> 16:23.597
I'm...

16:26.847 --> 16:29.034
I'm sorry.

16:45.545 --> 16:47.542
Daniel, tell him what you did.

16:49.749 --> 16:52.216
I didn't mean to.
It was... it was a mistake.

16:52.284 --> 16:54.753
You failed to act, Daniel.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.054
You did nothing.

16:56.122 --> 16:59.658
Let's hope Detective Ruiz
is made of better stuff.

16:59.725 --> 17:01.851
Wha...

17:08.667 --> 17:10.233
I'm not gonna do this!

17:10.301 --> 17:12.904
Isn't he everything you hate,
anyway?

17:12.972 --> 17:16.339
The reason your real Juarez
is overrun with violence?

17:16.407 --> 17:20.516
This... this is the man
who buys those drugs

17:20.595 --> 17:22.579
and then sneers at the place
he got them from

17:22.647 --> 17:26.852
and the people who died
so he can pack his nose!

17:27.419 --> 17:29.803
You're stalling right now.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.945
How do I know my son
is still alive?

17:39.131 --> 17:41.608
You're just gonna have
to trust me.

18:09.662 --> 18:11.675
Now, shoot this lying
piece of shit,

18:11.789 --> 18:13.644
and we'll be done.

18:50.035 --> 18:52.270
I'm not like you!

18:59.805 --> 19:01.459
You're not saving anyone.

19:03.382 --> 19:04.315
Daniel!

19:05.217 --> 19:06.350
Daniel!

19:37.716 --> 19:39.684
We've searched this already.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.723
There's nothing here, Sonya.

19:48.627 --> 19:50.761
Shh.

19:56.468 --> 19:57.401
Help me.

19:57.469 --> 20:00.205
Stop it, stop it. I got it.

20:00.272 --> 20:03.407
What? There's nothing.

20:12.084 --> 20:13.051
Plaster.

20:13.118 --> 20:14.418
Jesus.

20:14.486 --> 20:15.553
Pull it out.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.587
All the way out.

20:16.655 --> 20:17.922
Come on.

20:17.990 --> 20:20.100
All right, watch out.

20:20.826 --> 20:23.194
Step back.

20:31.270 --> 20:34.138
Was that supposed
to be the honorable move?

20:34.206 --> 20:35.684
'Cause it was the cowardly one.

20:35.719 --> 20:36.908
It doesn't mean anything.

20:36.976 --> 20:39.963
Just tell me where he is.

20:46.618 --> 20:49.354
You will be like me
before this ends.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.718
That I can promise you.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.429
In seconds, the snipers that I know
are posted everywhere

20:58.497 --> 21:00.899
will take my head right off.

21:00.966 --> 21:03.834
And you'll never know
where Gus is.

21:03.903 --> 21:05.270
No, no, no.

21:05.337 --> 21:07.638
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

21:07.906 --> 21:10.174
Don't shoot!

21:16.882 --> 21:19.583
Nobody shoot.

21:19.651 --> 21:21.585
Have your men hold their fire.

21:21.953 --> 21:24.398
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.143
Gus!

21:57.215 --> 21:59.262
Pick up the gun, Marco.

22:02.587 --> 22:04.225
No?

22:04.260 --> 22:05.835
You're no hero.

22:05.870 --> 22:07.524
Alma told me what you did
with that woman.

22:07.592 --> 22:08.525
Oh, shut up!

22:08.593 --> 22:10.054
You haven't changed a bit.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.529
Your appetites ruin everything.

22:12.597 --> 22:15.625
Destroy families, ruin lives.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.883
All so you can get your rocks off?

22:22.140 --> 22:26.594
Just, please,
tell me where he is.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.414
He's in a dark place, Marco.

22:31.482 --> 22:33.750
A cold, dark place.

22:35.798 --> 22:37.558
Good, Marco.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.791
Good.

22:43.353 --> 22:45.185
Do you know how Caleb died?

22:45.931 --> 22:47.653
Technically?

22:49.332 --> 22:50.998
He drowned in his own blood.

22:51.033 --> 22:54.038
End this, David! Or I will!

22:54.105 --> 22:56.510
Caleb's lungs were crushed,
right over there.

22:56.545 --> 23:00.444
Ambulance came in five minutes.
It didn't even matter for Jill.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.447
Do you have any idea
what that's like, Marco?

23:03.514 --> 23:05.883
To lose everything?

23:05.951 --> 23:08.352
Your wife, your son?

23:10.288 --> 23:12.389
No, you don't know.

23:13.070 --> 23:15.047
You can't know, Marco,

23:15.126 --> 23:18.091
what it's like to get that call.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.932
And to go see them.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.147
I said I was sorry.

23:26.852 --> 23:28.405
Please...

23:28.540 --> 23:32.091
Tell me where he is.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.385
Okay.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.841
Hank!
I need to talk to Marco.

23:48.876 --> 23:51.262
- Sonya.
- I got to...

23:51.329 --> 23:52.629
I gotta stop him.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.656
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- It's okay. Leave it.

23:54.771 --> 23:56.452
Sonya, be careful!

24:10.115 --> 24:12.516
Where is my son?

24:18.626 --> 24:20.689
Gus is dead, Marco.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.442
Marco! Don't shoot!

24:30.858 --> 24:32.288
Sonya?

24:33.971 --> 24:36.079
So... Sonya, did you find him?

24:36.214 --> 24:37.265
He's dead, Marco.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.250
Shut up.

24:38.285 --> 24:40.311
You had your chance
to save him, but it's too late.

24:40.378 --> 24:43.147
- Sonya!
- Marco, look at me.

24:43.214 --> 24:44.148
Gus is dead.

24:44.215 --> 24:45.349
Sonya!

24:45.417 --> 24:47.626
He died in a cold, dark place,

24:47.661 --> 24:50.354
waiting for you to rescue him.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.057
And now there's only one thing
left for you to do.

24:53.124 --> 24:55.426
I found him!
I found Gus!

24:55.493 --> 24:56.427
She's lying.

24:56.494 --> 24:57.694
He was in the house.

24:57.762 --> 24:58.895
What house, Sonya?

24:58.964 --> 24:59.964
Chambers' house.

25:00.031 --> 25:02.224
He was behind the wall.

25:04.728 --> 25:06.419
Did you find him alive?

25:06.781 --> 25:08.205
Put the gun down Marco.

25:09.347 --> 25:10.886
Answer me.

25:10.921 --> 25:12.810
Is my son alive?

25:13.979 --> 25:15.820
Yes!

25:16.686 --> 25:19.416
She's not a very good liar,
is she?

25:19.484 --> 25:20.917
Sonya?

25:20.986 --> 25:24.521
Don't kill him, Marco.
That's what he wants you to do.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.056
Sonya?

25:26.124 --> 25:28.058
Please.

25:28.126 --> 25:31.462
Just tell me if my son is alive.

25:33.173 --> 25:34.585
Yes!

25:34.720 --> 25:36.783
You found him...

25:36.918 --> 25:38.891
but is he alive?

25:39.026 --> 25:41.680
Yes. Yes!

25:43.056 --> 25:44.819
Sonya...

25:44.854 --> 25:46.496
Please tell me...

25:46.531 --> 25:48.543
Tell me the truth.

29:41.132 --> 29:43.401
What do you say we go
to that hospital

29:43.536 --> 29:45.333
and get the wrist set?

29:46.922 --> 29:48.820
Okay.

29:50.615 --> 29:52.687
You went out on the bridge.

29:53.603 --> 29:56.178
You could've got yourself killed.

29:59.578 --> 30:02.429
I did what I thought was best.

30:06.158 --> 30:09.242
What... what would you
have done, Hank?

30:11.796 --> 30:15.442
I can't honestly say
what I would have done.

30:17.634 --> 30:19.166
Marco would have killed Tate.

30:19.204 --> 30:21.137
Yes, he would.

30:21.205 --> 30:24.015
And you prevented that.

30:31.016 --> 30:34.134
I don't know what to say to him.

30:35.553 --> 30:39.004
Just go see him.
He could use a friend right now.

30:42.059 --> 30:44.060
A friend?

30:44.195 --> 30:45.885
Go on.

31:12.824 --> 31:14.303
Hey.

31:15.727 --> 31:17.678
I brought you some clothes.

31:21.098 --> 31:22.922
What for?

31:23.934 --> 31:25.953
When you get out.

31:29.741 --> 31:32.250
I don't want you here, Sonya.

31:37.016 --> 31:38.929
I need you to listen to me,
Marco.

31:46.090 --> 31:48.770
I'm not leaving
until you listen to me.

31:51.796 --> 31:55.378
I tried my best to save Gus,
but he was already dead.

31:59.003 --> 32:01.505
And I told you...

32:01.672 --> 32:04.132
what you wanted to hear.

32:05.976 --> 32:07.844
What was I supposed to do?

32:08.453 --> 32:10.144
Just...

32:11.243 --> 32:13.791
Leave me alone, please.

32:15.986 --> 32:17.913
I'm not leaving.

32:19.323 --> 32:21.186
We're friends, Marco.

32:21.321 --> 32:23.448
And I only did
what you taught me

32:23.526 --> 32:25.051
friends would do for each other.

32:25.130 --> 32:27.667
- Friends?
- Yes.

32:28.499 --> 32:31.169
You stopped me
from shooting him.

32:31.739 --> 32:33.592
Why?

32:33.627 --> 32:36.105
Because that's
what he wanted.

32:37.347 --> 32:39.278
And you're not that person.

32:39.862 --> 32:43.461
Oh, no.
Yeah, I am that person.

32:53.123 --> 32:55.410
We're not friends, Sonya.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.962
We were partners.

32:59.597 --> 33:02.151
That's over.

33:13.620 --> 33:16.226
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.194
Now I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

33:20.150 --> 33:23.520
I just... want to be alone.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.684
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.597
Go! Just go!

34:00.424 --> 34:02.559
Frye. Daniel Frye.

34:03.127 --> 34:05.298
- Are you family?
- No.

34:05.333 --> 34:07.382
I'm sorry.
You can't see him.

34:07.431 --> 34:09.384
Please.

34:09.418 --> 34:11.777
He doesn't have a lot of friends.

34:13.437 --> 34:15.438
All right.

34:21.579 --> 34:23.344
It's bad, isn't it?

34:24.353 --> 34:25.708
We won't know for a while.

34:25.850 --> 34:27.496
It was quite a fall.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.812
Is he gonna be all right?

34:30.540 --> 34:32.589
He suffered massive
internal injury,

34:32.628 --> 34:34.777
brain and spine trauma.

34:35.509 --> 34:37.159
When will we know?

34:37.194 --> 34:40.228
We'll have to see how
he does over the next 48 hours.

34:42.433 --> 34:46.328
- So we just wait?
- For now, yes.

35:52.069 --> 35:54.002
Can I help you?

35:55.072 --> 35:57.342
I'd like to see my son.

35:58.676 --> 36:00.803
Gustavo Ruiz.

36:02.547 --> 36:04.918
