01:27.126 --> 01:28.501
We're ready, boss.

01:30.751 --> 01:32.043
You can go.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.709
Move, let's move the cars.

01:38.376 --> 01:39.751
Let's go.

01:40.418 --> 01:43.126
Move, let's move the cars.
Let's go!

01:46.793 --> 01:48.459
- Mum?
-Hello!

01:48.626 --> 01:50.668
- Can you hear me?
-Is it you, my son?

01:50.876 --> 01:53.168
- Yes, it's me!
-I can't hear you.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.168
- Now you hear me?
-Yes, yes! Now it's better.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.918
I want to pray with you.

02:00.084 --> 02:01.918
<i>You do the introduction.</i>

02:05.959 --> 02:11.168
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

02:13.084 --> 02:15.168
Tomorrow I'll go to jail

02:16.376 --> 02:19.376
and I'm scared
you'll abandon me, my Lord.

02:20.668 --> 02:23.668
And that you might not understand
my actions.

02:25.876 --> 02:28.543
I just want to remind you
that everything I do,

02:30.084 --> 02:32.376
I do out of love of my family,

02:33.209 --> 02:36.251
to protect them
from all evil and danger.

02:37.959 --> 02:41.376
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

02:41.543 --> 02:44.334
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.168
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

02:50.334 --> 02:53.168
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

02:54.334 --> 02:57.251
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

02:57.418 --> 02:59.959
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

03:49.084 --> 03:50.876
Put every thing under the bed.

03:52.168 --> 03:52.834
Hurry.

03:55.543 --> 03:56.459
Hurry UP-

04:01.084 --> 04:03.793
Hi Nick. Get ready.
Pablo wants to see you.

04:12.584 --> 04:14.001
What now?

04:17.043 --> 04:19.375
Tell my brother
to push the tickets one day. ok?

04:20.043 --> 04:21.625
- O k.
-O k.

04:23.334 --> 04:24.626
Don't worry.

05:05.626 --> 05:06.293
Follow me.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.001
- Good evening.
-Good evening, Pablo.

06:05.084 --> 06:07.293
We are all family, right?

06:07.459 --> 06:09.126
Have a seat.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.334
Nico, sit over there.

06:30.668 --> 06:32.501
Well...

06:32.709 --> 06:35.959
I've made a deal with the Government.

06:37.668 --> 06:40.251
Tomorrow,
I'll surrender to the authorities.

06:41.751 --> 06:45.251
I'll be in jail... for a while.

06:45.418 --> 06:47.626
Till things get quiet again.

06:50.001 --> 06:53.793
I've called you all in person
because I need the help...

06:55.626 --> 06:58.626
of the people I trust the most.

07:00.418 --> 07:04.084
Our job is to hide our economic power

07:04.251 --> 07:05.918
from our enemies.

07:07.459 --> 07:11.084
And this treasure is the life

07:11.251 --> 07:14.376
and the future
of our families and children.

07:14.584 --> 07:17.084
And we'll be the only ones to know

07:17.251 --> 07:18.751
where it's hidden.

07:21.543 --> 07:22.793
So...

07:23.834 --> 07:25.709
the question is:

07:27.126 --> 07:30.168
are you ready to help me?

07:30.834 --> 07:33.209
- I am, Pablo.
-We're family.

07:33.376 --> 07:36.876
- Till death, patron.
-Whatever may come.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.959
And you, Nico?

07:44.209 --> 07:46.376
Me too.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.709
Very good.

07:50.668 --> 07:53.126
Reach hands.

07:59.001 --> 08:01.918
One, two, three! Let's do!

08:03.209 --> 08:04.209
Lights!

08:05.293 --> 08:08.043
Heavy metal, the workers can come out.

08:08.209 --> 08:10.251
Come on, people!

08:10.418 --> 08:13.126
Pepito,
you're gonna be in the first car.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.418
Alfonso,
you're gonna be in the second car.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.626
Nico, the third one.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.584
Ricardo, in the fourth.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.043
Felipe, you're in the fifth.
And Juan, in the sixth.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.793
Group One,
load the trucks as fast as possible.

09:00.584 --> 09:04.084
- Take these. Water too.
-Thank you

09:04.251 --> 09:07.168
Boy, take care.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.043
May God be with you.

09:21.751 --> 09:23.834
I see you've got two sandwiches.

09:24.126 --> 09:25.251
Yes.

09:30.876 --> 09:31.626
You're ok?

09:32.418 --> 09:33.293
Yes.

09:34.668 --> 09:35.668
Nick,

09:36.959 --> 09:40.543
I need you to go
to the town of ltuango.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.543
We're right here.

09:47.876 --> 09:51.334
You take the fifteen,
come around here...

09:51.834 --> 09:55.168
and this is the town right here.
Ituango.

09:56.251 --> 10:00.459
When you get to the main square,
park in front of the church.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.584
A local campesino will come to you.

10:04.751 --> 10:06.084
He's your guide.

10:06.668 --> 10:09.126
He will ask you: what's the number?

10:10.334 --> 10:12.543
And you will say setenta <i>y</i> dos.

10:13.501 --> 10:14.626
<i>Setenta y dos...</i>

10:14.793 --> 10:16.043
Seventy-two.

10:16.251 --> 10:17.584
Don't forget this number.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.709
Then he will take you to the cave

10:20.876 --> 10:23.834
and you will put everything inside.
In that cave.

10:24.668 --> 10:27.168
Once everything is secure,

10:27.334 --> 10:29.376
the campesino
will blow up the entrance.

10:29.543 --> 10:31.209
When the cave is sealed,

10:31.376 --> 10:34.209
then you can drive back
down the mountain.

10:37.834 --> 10:42.543
When you see the town of ltuango and
you know you can get back on your own,

10:43.251 --> 10:46.918
you're gonna stop the car
and you're gonna tell the campesino

10:47.084 --> 10:49.459
you're having problems with the wheel.

10:49.626 --> 10:51.584
Ask him to get out of the car

10:51.751 --> 10:54.626
and then you're gonna walk up to him

10:54.793 --> 10:56.543
and you're gonna shoot him
in the head with this.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.543
This is a 9mm.

11:03.334 --> 11:04.168
He is loaded, ok?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.959
The safety is on. Off, on.

11:11.126 --> 11:14.709
Off, on. Off, on.

11:17.084 --> 11:20.334
Now, let me put this
right under your thigh.

11:21.126 --> 11:22.209
That

11:22.459 --> 11:26.084
That way you can always get to it.

11:26.251 --> 11:29.043
Then you're gonna drive back
to the main square.

11:29.793 --> 11:32.918
In front of the church
there is a restaurant.

11:33.084 --> 11:35.709
Inside that restaurant
there is a phone.

11:36.459 --> 11:40.293
I want you to call me on this number

11:40.918 --> 11:43.084
to confirm that everything went well.

11:45.168 --> 11:47.918
When you shot the campesino
make sure you put that gun

11:48.084 --> 11:50.709
as close as you can to his head. ok?

11:55.376 --> 11:57.334
Now Nick, listen.

11:58.584 --> 12:02.084
It will be easy to kill him
if you don't know anything about him.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.126
So don't engage a conversation.

12:14.584 --> 12:15.543
You're ok?

12:18.876 --> 12:21.126
I've never done anything
like this before.

12:25.209 --> 12:27.334
We're all making sacrifices, Nico,

12:29.959 --> 12:31.543
and I'm very proud of you.

12:35.251 --> 12:36.709
You're like a son to me.

12:41.251 --> 12:41.918
Good luck.

12:42.084 --> 12:43.876
It's gonna be over quick.

14:08.168 --> 14:11.543
- That's for all:
-20,000 pesos for transport.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.709
Transporte... We never talked about
any money for transport.

14:13.876 --> 14:15.084
What are you talking about?

14:16.584 --> 14:18.001
In this car.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.834
Guys, when I will tell you,

14:24.001 --> 14:26.168
pull at the same time.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.126
This is all I have.

14:28.293 --> 14:29.793
Nick! Hold up.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.834
This guy is trying to cheat us.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.043
He wants more money for transport.

14:34.209 --> 14:37.084
Ok, this is all we have, ok?

14:38.418 --> 14:39.418
Take this.

14:39.584 --> 14:40.709
The truck don't go.

14:43.459 --> 14:44.584
Good, Ricardo.

14:46.626 --> 14:49.668
Eso. That's good.

14:52.959 --> 14:53.751
Excuse me.

14:56.084 --> 14:57.668
- Do you speak English?
-Yes.

14:58.959 --> 14:59.709
Great.

15:01.126 --> 15:03.543
I was wondering
if we could rent your truck?

15:04.834 --> 15:05.543
Rent?

15:05.834 --> 15:09.126
Yes. To help us transport our wood.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.793
For how much?

15:12.959 --> 15:15.501
I could give you
surf lessons in exchange?

15:21.209 --> 15:23.709
Are you planning to import
more Yankees around here?

15:24.251 --> 15:25.376
Junkies?

15:25.751 --> 15:29.251
Yankees! Yeah... Maybe.

15:30.168 --> 15:32.459
Seriously. I don't rent my truck.

15:33.751 --> 15:35.043
You can have it for free.

15:35.959 --> 15:36.626
Manuel.

15:36.793 --> 15:38.126
<i>Are you serious?</i>

15:38.293 --> 15:38.959
Go with him.

15:39.126 --> 15:41.459
That's amazing. Thank you!
That's gonna help us so much.

15:41.626 --> 15:45.001
By the way: we're not Yankees,

15:45.876 --> 15:47.959
we're Canadians.
It does make a difference.

15:48.126 --> 15:48.876
Does it?

15:50.959 --> 15:52.001
Thank you.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.626
Let it down!

17:07.584 --> 17:09.251
Take that shit down.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.626
Wake up! Get up!

17:20.542 --> 17:23.834
- Get up, get up, get up! Everybody up!
-Get up.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.292
Wake up! Wake up!

17:29.709 --> 17:31.751
What the hell are you doing!
Don't do that!

17:33.709 --> 17:34.751
Let's speak.

17:34.918 --> 17:36.709
- Let's speak.
-You are the boss?

17:37.751 --> 17:40.084
Yeah! Yeah, I'm the boss.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.459
Come here.

17:42.793 --> 17:44.084
Come here.

17:45.251 --> 17:47.543
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

17:48.376 --> 17:50.334
You think you can come to my woods

17:50.501 --> 17:52.084
and do as you like, or what?

17:52.251 --> 17:53.209
Ok.

17:53.584 --> 17:56.334
They told me

17:56.501 --> 17:59.459
that this doesn't belong to anyone.

17:59.834 --> 18:00.834
What?

18:03.126 --> 18:04.418
This place is mine.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.376
Everything around here is mine.

18:10.126 --> 18:11.918
If you want to do something here...

18:12.084 --> 18:14.543
Business... You have to pay.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.168
Come to the village.

18:27.043 --> 18:29.251
Ask for the Rolando brothers.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.584
Everyone knows who we are.

18:35.709 --> 18:36.793
All right.

18:37.959 --> 18:38.959
All right.

18:40.126 --> 18:42.334
Move forward, sissy!

18:44.793 --> 18:45.918
Let's

18:54.876 --> 18:55.959
What was that, Dylan?

18:56.126 --> 18:57.293
What do they want?

18:57.459 --> 18:58.543
What do you think they want?

18:58.709 --> 19:00.126
They want money.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.876
So guys, we just met the local thugs.

19:05.501 --> 19:08.543
Don't worry, brother.
They'll forget about us.

19:35.959 --> 19:37.668
Are you looking for someone?

19:38.584 --> 19:39.334
Yeah.

19:41.918 --> 19:43.376
I was looking for you.

19:45.959 --> 19:48.709
Yeah, the truck really helped. Here.

19:48.876 --> 19:50.584
- Thank you.
-Thank you.

19:51.001 --> 19:52.459
Flowers! Thank you.

19:53.043 --> 19:54.876
I'm Nick Brady by the way.

19:55.418 --> 19:56.334
Maria.

19:57.418 --> 19:59.834
Maria, that's a beautiful name.

20:00.918 --> 20:02.376
Thank you.

20:02.793 --> 20:04.376
Is this your house?

20:04.543 --> 20:07.918
Yes.
Well, until the clinic is finished.

20:08.084 --> 20:10.709
We do charity work
for poor communities.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.709
That's great!

20:12.501 --> 20:14.459
- Who is "we"?
-My uncle.

20:14.751 --> 20:15.751
I work for him.

20:18.334 --> 20:20.751
Oh! Uncle Pablo!

20:21.168 --> 20:22.001
Yes.

20:25.668 --> 20:27.251
Can I have a glass of water?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.418
I'm really thirsty.

20:37.376 --> 20:41.334
So what is it that you have
against yankees?

20:41.918 --> 20:44.918
I'm so sorry, I was rude.

20:45.084 --> 20:47.209
Yeah. You were very rude.
You were like...

20:48.084 --> 20:51.834
"Are you going to import more
"jankees" around here?"

20:55.834 --> 20:57.751
It's just that all of you foreigners

20:57.918 --> 21:00.834
come here and think
you found paradise.

21:02.751 --> 21:04.418
All I see is what is wrong with it.

21:05.668 --> 21:09.209
Malnutrition, illiteracy, poverty...

21:10.376 --> 21:13.001
A lot of people need help around here.

21:17.376 --> 21:21.293
You could find more fulfilling ways
to live here if you wanted.

21:22.126 --> 21:23.209
What do you mean?

21:24.876 --> 21:25.709
I don't know...

21:27.126 --> 21:31.751
I mean that surfing
is not the only option.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.876
Who said I came here to surf?

21:43.168 --> 21:47.668
You know my brother...
He lost his ability to surf.

21:50.668 --> 21:52.334
But he always had this dream

21:53.084 --> 21:55.293
of coming back and living here.

22:01.709 --> 22:04.001
I just want to see him happy again.

22:16.876 --> 22:18.209
Well...

22:20.251 --> 22:22.418
I have to get up at five tomorrow.

22:23.334 --> 22:24.751
That's early.

22:29.959 --> 22:30.876
Thank you.

22:31.709 --> 22:34.584
That was a great glass of water.

22:36.876 --> 22:37.834
Goodnight.

22:39.501 --> 22:40.501
Goodnight.

23:09.084 --> 23:13.459
You know it's a... It's kind
of a long walk back in the dark.

23:16.543 --> 23:19.959
You're a big boy. You can do it.

24:49.751 --> 24:52.793
Maria! You almost had it!

24:53.459 --> 24:55.793
No Nick. I don't want to do this, ok?

24:55.959 --> 24:58.751
I hate surfing, really,
you are a bad teacher.

24:58.918 --> 25:00.959
I'm not a bad teacher, come on!
You're so close!

25:01.126 --> 25:02.084
You almost had it.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.709
I have to go! ok?

25:03.876 --> 25:05.626
Oh you're killing me.
You're killing me.

25:05.959 --> 25:06.959
Will you come?

25:07.918 --> 25:09.251
- I don't know.
-Please say yes.

25:09.418 --> 25:10.793
- Maybe.
-Yes.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.751
- Yes, maybe.
-Yes or maybe?

25:12.918 --> 25:14.793
- Yes, maybe. That's it!
-Ok.

25:16.126 --> 25:17.001
Off you go.

25:17.168 --> 25:17.959
I kill you.

25:18.126 --> 25:19.043
You're gonna kill me?

25:19.209 --> 25:21.584
Yes. You have to be there.

25:22.334 --> 25:24.709
Special greeting

25:24.876 --> 25:28.668
for the young people of this town.

25:29.751 --> 25:32.126
I'm thankful

25:32.293 --> 25:34.376
to all the people

25:34.584 --> 25:37.251
who have helped

25:37.459 --> 25:39.876
renovating this clinic.

25:49.543 --> 25:51.126
This hospital...

25:51.293 --> 25:53.001
This hospital

25:53.168 --> 25:55.876
is but one small step

25:56.043 --> 25:59.459
towards the life you deserve.

26:05.959 --> 26:08.001
I'm proud

26:08.168 --> 26:10.251
of my humble origins.

26:10.459 --> 26:13.959
My family never had great means.

26:14.709 --> 26:15.918
And we experienced

26:16.084 --> 26:19.293
the same problems most Colombian
families are faced with daily.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.293
I promise you...

26:25.501 --> 26:29.293
I promise you
that if I can do anything

26:29.501 --> 26:32.876
I'll keep fighting for your rights.

26:34.959 --> 26:38.793
Civismo en marcha
will provide you with a shield

26:38.959 --> 26:41.668
that will protect you from all evil.

26:43.126 --> 26:44.543
Thank you very much!

26:50.793 --> 26:53.543
People from Turbo,

26:53.709 --> 26:56.251
once more let's thank

26:56.459 --> 26:58.376
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.

27:27.418 --> 27:28.959
Come on!

27:31.084 --> 27:32.668
Why didn't you come over?

27:32.834 --> 27:34.043
Why didn't you come over?

27:35.626 --> 27:37.293
Not in my shorts, you know...

27:37.459 --> 27:40.459
Ok. You might be right.
He's kind of old style.

27:41.209 --> 27:42.918
He really wants to meet you.

27:43.084 --> 27:44.334
That's nice.

27:46.334 --> 27:47.376
What is it?

27:53.293 --> 27:55.251
I'm not ready for you to leave here.

27:58.251 --> 28:00.751
Everything is going to be find for us.

28:00.918 --> 28:01.918
I know.

28:18.043 --> 28:20.834
This jacket... with these pants.

28:22.418 --> 28:25.668
- If it fits big, I'll fix it.
-Thank you.

28:35.376 --> 28:37.376
Can I help you, Sir?

28:39.709 --> 28:40.959
No, you can't.

28:44.793 --> 28:45.793
Gringo,

28:47.376 --> 28:48.293
get out.

28:55.751 --> 28:57.543
Come here.

29:19.126 --> 29:19.876
Come on.

29:29.334 --> 29:30.626
Come on, man.

29:33.251 --> 29:36.418
Stop it! Please stop it,
it's going to kill him!

29:39.709 --> 29:43.376
Stop it, it's going to kill him!
Stop it, it's going to kill him!

30:17.251 --> 30:19.126
-It's beautiful, no?
-Very beautiful.

30:20.751 --> 30:22.584
- Hi!
-What's up, bonita?

30:23.626 --> 30:25.959
Juanita! Your dress is beautiful!

30:26.168 --> 30:27.584
This is Nick.

30:27.751 --> 30:30.793
Nice meeting you.
Maria's spoken so much about you.

30:31.459 --> 30:33.418
I really want you to meet him.

30:35.418 --> 30:36.918
So nice to see you!

30:37.418 --> 30:39.543
- You're so elegant!
-How are you?

30:39.709 --> 30:43.001
Now I need your attention.
This is my boyfriend Nick.

30:44.084 --> 30:46.293
He's my uncle, the doctor Prieto.

30:46.459 --> 30:48.668
His wife. And all my cousins.

30:55.751 --> 30:57.334
See you later.

30:58.501 --> 30:59.168
Aunt!

31:00.126 --> 31:02.959
- Aunt!
-I was looking for you.

31:03.168 --> 31:06.876
- This is Nick.
-Nice meeting you. You've had lunch?

31:07.043 --> 31:09.626
- Yes. Where is Pablo?
-Over here, in the water.

31:11.834 --> 31:13.001
Can we go say hi?

31:13.501 --> 31:16.168
I'll ask him. I'll be right back.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.293
- She's going to ask Pablo.
-Ok.

31:23.584 --> 31:25.376
Pablo, go get dressed.

31:25.543 --> 31:29.084
Maria wants to introduce
her boyfriend to you.

31:30.376 --> 31:31.793
Come over, Maria love, come!

31:42.543 --> 31:44.751
- Hi Maria!
-Hi prince, how are you?

31:44.918 --> 31:45.668
OK.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.793
- Did you have a good flight?
-Very good.

31:47.959 --> 31:51.043
- Happy birthday, uncle Pablo!
-Thank you.

31:54.293 --> 31:57.334
At last, Pablo, this is Nick.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.918
- Hi. Welcome, Nick.
-Thank you.

32:04.043 --> 32:06.918
- Does he speak Colombian?
-No. No, English.

32:07.876 --> 32:10.126
Well,
Maria says very good things about you.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.709
Thank you. Happy birthday, Mr Escobar!

32:14.084 --> 32:14.959
Call me Pablo.

32:15.126 --> 32:17.251
Maria, show him around the house

32:17.418 --> 32:20.376
and introduce him to Grandma.

32:22.959 --> 32:25.751
- Go, go see Grandma.
-We're going to now, Pablo.

32:34.168 --> 32:38.168
We are so proud that Maria
opened up a clinic for the poor.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.459
She's adorable.

32:43.584 --> 32:46.543
My uncle has an obsession with gold.

32:48.709 --> 32:50.209
That's an expensive obsession.

33:11.501 --> 33:16.293
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

33:16.459 --> 33:20.418
<i>Happy birthday to you,</i>

33:47.084 --> 33:49.543
Hey to Pablo!

33:56.668 --> 33:58.418
A Speech!

34:12.708 --> 34:14.708
<i>In the sky</i>

34:14.876 --> 34:17.376
<i>fly the clouds</i>

34:17.708 --> 34:21.876
<i>going toward the sea.</i>

34:27.251 --> 34:30.668
<i>God, how I love you.</i>

34:31.708 --> 34:35.168
<i>I cannot...</i>

34:39.043 --> 34:42.751
<i>embrace...</i>

34:44.458 --> 34:48.208
<i>so much happiness,</i>

35:01.084 --> 35:03.501
How did he make all his money?

35:06.209 --> 35:07.418
Cocaine.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.959
People here in Colombia

35:15.126 --> 35:18.793
have been chewing coca leaves since
the beginning of time.

35:19.084 --> 35:23.209
Pablo is just exporting
a national product.

35:24.043 --> 35:27.126
Most of the money he makes
goes to the poor.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.168
You go to any of the barrios
and ask the people there:

35:32.793 --> 35:34.084
they love him.

35:36.251 --> 35:39.126
Come on. Dance with me.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.084
I'm sorry Nick, did I wake you?

36:03.376 --> 36:04.584
It's ok.

36:08.668 --> 36:11.001
Maria wanted us to talk.

36:11.751 --> 36:15.793
She's been going:
"Tio Pablo. Nick this, Nick that."

36:15.959 --> 36:17.459
"Nick, Nick, Nick..."

36:18.959 --> 36:20.876
"Nick this, Nick that."

36:25.543 --> 36:27.543
ls everything ok? ls your room ok?

36:27.709 --> 36:29.584
Yeah. Yeah it's great. Thank you.

36:31.293 --> 36:34.459
So Maria tells me that your brother
lives at the beach?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.209
And what does he do there?

36:36.376 --> 36:38.626
He has a small business,

36:39.751 --> 36:41.126
they serve food and drinks,

36:41.293 --> 36:44.709
and I give surfing lessons.
It's like a surf camp, sort of.

36:45.126 --> 36:46.209
- Ah, it's nice.
-Yeah...

36:47.959 --> 36:49.168
That's nice.

36:50.501 --> 36:51.459
That's nice.

36:54.459 --> 36:57.001
Nick? Do you believe in God?

36:58.168 --> 37:00.084
Yes.

37:00.543 --> 37:01.793
That's good.

37:02.626 --> 37:04.501
Do you take drugs?

37:05.293 --> 37:08.834
No. No I mean, it's not really for me.

37:09.793 --> 37:10.834
That's good.

37:12.209 --> 37:16.334
I've seen drugs eat the souls
of many great men.

37:20.543 --> 37:21.584
Well, listen, Nick.

37:22.959 --> 37:27.084
I just wanted to say that Maria
is like a daughter to me

37:28.501 --> 37:31.043
and we're very happy
if she's found a good match.

37:31.918 --> 37:33.168
Good.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.793
That's good.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.084
Are you serious about her?

37:39.834 --> 37:41.209
Yeah, absolutely.

37:42.668 --> 37:44.084
Do you love her?

37:45.376 --> 37:47.668
- Yeah. More than anything.
-Good.

37:49.751 --> 37:51.001
True love.

37:52.251 --> 37:53.334
True love.

37:53.793 --> 37:54.876
That's the best.

37:55.626 --> 37:57.543
True love.

38:00.793 --> 38:03.959
Good.
So what happened to your arm?

38:05.709 --> 38:07.293
I got attacked by a dog.

38:11.126 --> 38:12.793
That's a big dog.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.293
What happened?

38:14.626 --> 38:17.709
Just some locals... They wanted us
to pay to be on the beach

38:17.876 --> 38:19.793
and we didn't give in.

38:22.168 --> 38:24.043
- And that was their dog?
-Yeah.

38:28.543 --> 38:31.001
Nick, did you like this song
I sang to my wife tonight?

38:32.709 --> 38:35.001
Yeah, that was great.

38:35.168 --> 38:37.543
I didn't understand all of it,
but it was beautiful.

38:38.876 --> 38:41.376
<i>-L'll</i> get a translation.
- Perfect.

38:43.418 --> 38:45.876
Maybe one day you'll sing it to Maria?

38:46.543 --> 38:48.126
In front of all your friends.

38:49.334 --> 38:50.584
Maybe.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.043
We had a good talk.

38:53.209 --> 38:53.876
Yeah.

38:55.043 --> 38:56.334
Get some rest.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.501
I'll see you in the morning.

39:03.959 --> 39:07.084
- Good night.
-Good night.

39:14.126 --> 39:17.668
Light, camera, action!

39:38.834 --> 39:40.751
Kiss again.

39:52.001 --> 39:55.126
Nick and Maria will soon be married

39:55.293 --> 39:59.293
and they will give
many babies to their family.

39:59.918 --> 40:01.584
Right, Nick?

40:01.751 --> 40:03.751
Yep. Yep. Hopefully.

40:05.501 --> 40:06.501
You'd better be fast

40:06.668 --> 40:09.501
or we'll extradite you back to Canada.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.959
Now a big round of applause

40:14.418 --> 40:18.084
to the new member
of the Escobar Gaviria family.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.168
Come on.

40:42.251 --> 40:44.543
<i>Did you tell Escobar</i>

40:44.709 --> 40:46.293
<i>anything about the Roldano Brothers?</i>

40:47.959 --> 40:50.209
They were killed. Two days ago.

40:50.376 --> 40:52.668
They were hung upside down
and burned alive.

40:53.959 --> 40:57.834
Everyone in town is saying
that Escobar and his men did it.

41:05.709 --> 41:07.126
It's not true, brother.

41:09.126 --> 41:11.334
He would never do something like that.

41:12.459 --> 41:14.709
He offered me a job at the Hacienda.

41:14.876 --> 41:16.209
Wait, he did what?

41:16.918 --> 41:19.001
I want you to be happy for me, ok?

41:20.209 --> 41:21.209
Nick.

41:21.834 --> 41:24.959
Nick, you've gotta listen to me
on this one...

41:26.209 --> 41:26.876
Nick!

41:33.376 --> 41:35.668
- Good morning, Carmen.
-Good morning, Nick.

41:35.834 --> 41:38.084
- Daniela.
-Good morning, Nick.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.334
Good morning.

42:14.168 --> 42:16.168
Keep going. Keep going.

42:17.876 --> 42:18.918
- Are you tired?
-Yes.

42:19.084 --> 42:19.834
- Yes?
-Yes.

42:20.001 --> 42:21.251
Nico, come!

42:21.418 --> 42:24.709
- No, buddy. I can't.
-Look at his face.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.126
He's dead, Luis.

42:26.293 --> 42:27.293
There you go.

42:27.793 --> 42:28.834
- Yeah.
-I don't want to.

42:29.001 --> 42:30.293
It's your turn.

42:31.084 --> 42:32.418
Okay.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.251
Luis, get ready!

42:44.793 --> 42:46.168
What are you doing? It's sunday.

42:46.543 --> 42:48.793
That's ok,
I'm just grabbing the pony for Luis.

42:48.959 --> 42:50.376
Nick,
there's no one there to help you!

42:50.543 --> 42:51.876
It's ok, I can do it.

43:22.751 --> 43:23.918
Watch out!

43:25.834 --> 43:28.584
- Who's that?
-Nick. Maria's boyfriend.

43:38.168 --> 43:39.459
Finish it off.

43:56.751 --> 43:59.334
At last we meet, Nick.
It's a pleasure.

44:01.376 --> 44:03.001
My name is Drago Gutierrez,

44:03.168 --> 44:04.751
I work for <i>el</i> patron too.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.709
I know Maria
since she was a little kid.

44:11.876 --> 44:13.043
Everything okay?

44:14.084 --> 44:15.918
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

44:16.501 --> 44:17.251
Look at me.

44:28.251 --> 44:31.959
Bambi, get me the boss.
We have a problem.

44:45.418 --> 44:47.251
You know who died in this car?

44:48.126 --> 44:49.918
Clyde Barrow.

44:50.084 --> 44:51.293
Who?

44:51.459 --> 44:54.376
- Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker...
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:54.543 --> 44:55.751
Bonnie and Clyde.

44:56.793 --> 44:57.793
Get in.

44:58.793 --> 45:00.084
No fear, Nico, no fear.

45:13.584 --> 45:16.376
Bonnie Parker died
right where you're sitting.

45:17.501 --> 45:21.376
She had fifty bullet holes
in her body.

45:22.334 --> 45:25.959
Someone close to them betrayed them
and they fell into a trap.

45:31.834 --> 45:34.918
If I fall into a trap
like Bonnie and Clyde,

45:36.668 --> 45:37.709
that's no good.

45:39.876 --> 45:41.709
That's why I have to trust

45:41.876 --> 45:44.084
everyone near me.

45:46.459 --> 45:49.459
So, if you see anything strange
around here,

45:49.626 --> 45:51.334
you come and tell me, ok?

45:52.501 --> 45:54.668
Not a word to anyone.

45:54.834 --> 45:56.543
Not even Maria.

46:00.834 --> 46:02.543
Understand?

46:07.459 --> 46:09.334
I understand.

46:11.084 --> 46:13.251
<i>Feind hiort mit.</i>

46:14.293 --> 46:15.543
The enemy's listening.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.043
Hi.

47:26.334 --> 47:28.126
You didn't sleep all night.

47:28.793 --> 47:29.918
Everything's ok?

47:35.626 --> 47:37.459
Let's go back to the beach.

47:39.501 --> 47:43.126
Please. I miss that life, Maria.

47:44.418 --> 47:45.793
Trust me, let's go back there.

47:47.001 --> 47:49.084
I thought you loved it here.

47:49.251 --> 47:53.043
It's just so different.
Go with me, please.

47:57.418 --> 47:58.959
This is my family, Nick.

48:06.834 --> 48:08.334
What is it, Nick?

48:11.168 --> 48:12.418
You are not happy with me?

48:13.876 --> 48:15.001
You want to leave me?

48:15.168 --> 48:16.168
No.

48:17.293 --> 48:20.876
Maria, I can't even imagine
a life without you.

48:21.043 --> 48:22.376
Then what is it?

48:24.001 --> 48:25.709
Everybody loves you here.

48:30.834 --> 48:32.459
You're part of my family.

48:50.918 --> 48:53.793
Nico.
Come and sit next to your fiancée.

49:30.209 --> 49:32.959
Please be careful with those frames,
put them here.

49:33.126 --> 49:35.751
<i>It's the biggest corruption scandal
in the history of Congress.</i>

49:35.918 --> 49:38.251
<i>Senator Pablo Escobar has been found</i>

49:38.418 --> 49:41.001
<i>to have a criminal record
as a drug dealer.</i>

49:41.168 --> 49:42.584
<i>This operation</i>

49:42.751 --> 49:45.293
<i>is having significant results</i>

49:45.459 --> 49:49.043
so we need to have the national
public and armed forces support it.

49:50.376 --> 49:53.126
<i>This will give you
an idea of the magnitude</i>

49:53.918 --> 49:56.751
<i>of the narco trafficking problem
we have in this country.</i>

50:04.043 --> 50:07.376
First, the Minister of Justice
lied when he said that...

50:07.543 --> 50:11.126
Pablo Escobar had a criminal record
in the United States.

50:11.293 --> 50:13.626
- Hello, Nick.
-Hello.

50:13.793 --> 50:14.918
Hello, Nico.

50:16.334 --> 50:19.668
As you can see we're moving everyone
out of the Hacienda.

50:19.834 --> 50:23.168
For a little while. You and Maria
will go to your brother's

50:23.334 --> 50:25.459
until we find you a place in Medellin.

50:29.043 --> 50:32.376
Drago will show you how to use
everything inside this bag.

50:54.501 --> 50:55.543
What is this?

50:59.709 --> 51:02.543
-It's for self defense, Dylan.
-Are you shitting me?

51:03.709 --> 51:05.334
I don't want a gun in my house!

51:08.084 --> 51:09.418
What is it?

51:10.168 --> 51:12.293
Is it the money? ls it?

51:14.293 --> 51:16.626
Is it really worth it
to become like them?

51:17.376 --> 51:18.584
I'm not like them.

51:20.751 --> 51:22.709
You're breaking my heart, man.

51:25.126 --> 51:28.293
I don't want Anne
to know anything about this.

51:28.668 --> 51:32.501
So, you make something up,
you pack your bags and you leave.

51:33.543 --> 51:35.001
Don't make a scene.

51:35.459 --> 51:37.668
Guys! Come to the radio!

51:37.834 --> 51:39.876
The Minister of Justice
has been killed.

51:50.501 --> 51:52.293
They say it was Pablo.

51:55.001 --> 51:58.209
They say that
he's declared war on the government.

52:37.459 --> 52:38.876
This is your bedroom.

52:40.001 --> 52:40.876
Nice.

52:41.959 --> 52:43.334
This is the kitchen,

52:44.668 --> 52:47.543
and this is Pablo's bedroom
and Pablo's bathroom.

52:47.709 --> 52:50.043
And this is Pablo's money.
You don't touch it.

52:50.209 --> 52:52.709
He needs to keep moving
around these days.

52:52.876 --> 52:55.584
But don't worry,
this war will soon be over.

52:55.918 --> 52:58.126
- Are you done with the cash?
-lt's all done boss.

52:58.293 --> 53:01.001
Let's <i>go!</i> Let's <i>go, chiquitin!</i>

53:03.584 --> 53:04.668
Keys.

53:05.043 --> 53:05.709
Have fun.

53:05.876 --> 53:08.876
<i>The assassination of the Minister
of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilia</i>

53:09.043 --> 53:11.751
<i>has Colombia
on the verge of a civil</i> war.

53:11.918 --> 53:14.293
<i>These are chilling words
from Pablo Escobar's last interview.</i>

53:14.459 --> 53:17.668
<i>The Minister of Justice
lied to the country six times.</i>

53:17.876 --> 53:21.126
<i>He said he wasn't going to resign.</i>

53:21.293 --> 53:23.543
Let's see what happens
in the next few days.

53:25.876 --> 53:27.918
<i>Everyone who opposes Pablo Escobar</i>

53:28.084 --> 53:30.376
<i>is a potential target
of his assassins.</i>

53:30.543 --> 53:32.834
<i>The epidemic of violence
is unprecedented.</i>

53:33.001 --> 53:34.834
<i>Innocent people</i>

53:35.001 --> 53:37.043
<i>are getting caught
in the crossfire.</i>

53:37.251 --> 53:40.709
<i>American forces have now joined
the biggest manhunt</i>

53:40.918 --> 53:44.209
<i>in Colombia's history
for the drug Lord.</i>

53:45.376 --> 53:47.501
<i>Escobar,
confronting this new threat,</i>

53:47.668 --> 53:49.793
<i>responds with
a brutal wave of terror.</i>

53:50.084 --> 53:53.418
<i>The cartel will soon pay
for their crimes.</i>

53:53.584 --> 53:56.418
<i>Escobar and his allies
are an enemy of the state.</i>

54:42.084 --> 54:43.126
Dad!

55:23.084 --> 55:26.751
Boys, try these delicious beans
that Maria made for patron.

55:30.793 --> 55:31.918
It's Ramirez.

55:35.293 --> 55:37.459
Dursi, how are you?

55:39.751 --> 55:40.709
All set.

55:41.126 --> 55:42.751
Boys, we have to get going.

55:50.834 --> 55:52.001
I'll call you later.

56:26.876 --> 56:29.084
This son of a bitch.

56:36.418 --> 56:40.043
Nico. I'm just gonna watch the game
and then I go.

56:41.793 --> 56:43.459
Have a beer, have a beer, here.

56:46.251 --> 56:47.709
How's Maria feeling?

56:50.334 --> 56:51.376
She's fine.

56:53.584 --> 56:54.418
Just fine?

56:56.376 --> 56:57.709
Yeah, she's ok.

56:59.251 --> 57:00.668
Maybe she's pregnant.

57:02.501 --> 57:04.001
No. Definitely not.

57:04.168 --> 57:05.501
What are you waiting for, Nico?

57:06.084 --> 57:08.751
Attack. Attack, Nico, attack.

57:08.918 --> 57:10.251
We're working on it.

57:11.668 --> 57:13.793
He's working on it.

57:14.376 --> 57:17.626
Shouldn't be work,
Nick, shouldn't be work...

57:21.501 --> 57:23.918
Your brother has a kid, hum?

57:24.251 --> 57:26.709
Yeah.
And they're expecting another one.

57:27.251 --> 57:28.668
You can do it.

57:31.376 --> 57:32.626
They're actually

57:33.418 --> 57:35.418
thinking about going back to Canada.

57:36.876 --> 57:40.209
She's kind of homesick
and wants to go back there.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.584
I want to ask you,

57:45.793 --> 57:48.834
I think that it might be good
for me and Maria to go back too.

57:50.084 --> 57:52.709
At least for a little while,
until things cool off around here.

57:53.376 --> 57:56.043
That's not a good idea, Nico. Not now.

58:00.001 --> 58:01.334
Does Maria know about it?

58:02.501 --> 58:04.959
Yeah, we talked about it.

58:09.334 --> 58:12.251
It's because
they're hitting like goats.

58:19.709 --> 58:22.501
Why does your brother wanna go back?

58:22.668 --> 58:24.584
Has he been having trouble
at the beach?

58:24.751 --> 58:27.834
No, that's all over, thank God.

58:28.918 --> 58:29.959
Thank God?

58:32.959 --> 58:34.251
What do you mean thank God?

58:36.626 --> 58:39.209
Nothing. Just a figure of speech.

58:40.793 --> 58:42.168
Ok.

58:46.543 --> 58:48.418
'Cause God has done
nothing to do with it.

58:50.501 --> 58:52.584
It was you, Nick.

58:55.959 --> 58:58.876
It was your intervention
that got those people killed.

59:01.626 --> 59:03.626
You're as guilty as I am.

59:13.293 --> 59:15.584
Camillo,
can you come help me with this?

59:15.751 --> 59:16.793
Sure.

59:17.876 --> 59:19.793
Nick, we forgot the salt.

59:33.959 --> 59:35.751
Thanks so much for doing this.
It's been impossible to get away.

59:35.918 --> 59:37.959
- How are you getting to the airport?
-Just don't worry about it.

59:38.126 --> 59:40.626
Just buy us tickets for Friday, ok?
We'll meet you guys there.

59:41.668 --> 59:43.334
I'm glad to have you back, brother.

59:43.501 --> 59:46.168
- I love you, Dylan.
-I love you too. Get out of here.

59:46.334 --> 59:47.834
Bye bye.

01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:09.043
Hi, Nick.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.959
It will be easy to kill him
if you don't know anything about him.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:31.376
We're all making sacrifices, Nico.

01:00:32.168 --> 01:00:34.251
And I'm very proud of you.

01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:39.209
You're like a son to me.

01:01:43.918 --> 01:01:45.959
You want melons?

01:01:46.459 --> 01:01:47.918
- Take some.
-No, thank you.

01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:51.751
Two for 80 pesos.
Take them, they're delicious.

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:53.084
Take them.

01:01:56.626 --> 01:01:58.543
Take them, take them. Take them.

01:02:10.543 --> 01:02:11.626
Take them. They're delicious.

01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:14.043
No, no, no, thank you.

01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:16.084
Ok then.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.168
Melons!

01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:40.334
Let's go! Come on! Start the car.

01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:43.418
Start the car, brother.
What are you waiting for?

01:02:44.418 --> 01:02:45.251
Who are you?

01:02:48.418 --> 01:02:49.751
I'm Martin.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.126
Broke leg.

01:02:53.293 --> 01:02:54.376
No come.

01:02:54.543 --> 01:02:56.084
He can't come. I'm Martin.

01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:57.334
I take you.

01:03:04.168 --> 01:03:06.751
I'll take you.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.043
What's the number?

01:03:33.918 --> 01:03:35.959
Don't look. Don't look!

01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:46.084
Don't move, understand?

01:04:08.959 --> 01:04:10.334
It's not working.

01:04:11.043 --> 01:04:12.959
This phone never worked.

01:04:13.168 --> 01:04:15.709
If you have another one,
it's very important.

01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:21.668
Follow me. It's here.

01:04:27.626 --> 01:04:29.251
- This way.
-Thank you.

01:04:30.668 --> 01:04:31.668
Hello.

01:04:46.584 --> 01:04:49.001
I need to speak to the man
that gave me this number.

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:53.209
<i>Nico, tell me.</i>

01:04:53.376 --> 01:04:55.209
I'm here at the church.

01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:58.584
The campesino couldn't come cause
he broke his leg so he sent his son.

01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:00.543
He seems to know
how everything goes but...

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.626
he's just a kid.

01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:07.501
Am I supposed
to do everything the same

01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:11.043
until the end?

01:05:12.834 --> 01:05:14.584
<i>Call me when it's all over.</i>

01:05:29.376 --> 01:05:30.584
Everything okay?

01:05:36.918 --> 01:05:38.751
The number is 72.

01:05:41.584 --> 01:05:44.126
We have to go this way. 72. That's it.

01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:48.293
Let's go.

01:07:24.168 --> 01:07:27.668
If I had been driving, we would have
been here like an hour ago.

01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:30.459
But you're driving
like you're scared or something.

01:07:30.626 --> 01:07:32.376
Well whatever, there's your cave.

01:07:32.543 --> 01:07:35.293
But I know these mountains
like the back of my hand

01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:39.209
and you're driving like one or two
kilometers per hour, you feel me?

01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:42.209
Hey, here it is, 72.

01:07:57.709 --> 01:08:00.001
It's nicely done.

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.959
Brother, it's almost time to eat.

01:08:12.126 --> 01:08:13.501
Es que hay hungry.

01:08:14.668 --> 01:08:17.376
<i>Mi</i> wife prepare very good food.

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:21.459
You have a wife?

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:23.792
Yes, of course.

01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:26.292
Of course, brother.

01:08:27.584 --> 01:08:30.959
This is my wife, Estrella.

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:33.667
And my son, Martin Junior.

01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:35.334
This is my son.

01:08:38.084 --> 01:08:39.126
How old are you?

01:08:40.084 --> 01:08:41.459
Fifteen.

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.959
We have to work, we'll eat later.

01:09:28.459 --> 01:09:30.959
They're heavy, no?

01:09:33.126 --> 01:09:34.376
What's inside?

01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:38.001
Just go wait for me outside.

01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:40.167
Go.

01:09:40.334 --> 01:09:44.084
All right.
I'm going to set the dynamite

01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:46.251
and the cable.

01:11:23.001 --> 01:11:24.043
Good job.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:30.043
- Do you want I drive?
-No, I'll drive.

01:11:53.584 --> 01:11:54.959
You ok, Nick?

01:11:55.668 --> 01:11:56.709
I'm fine.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.459
Come on, let's go.

01:12:30.959 --> 01:12:32.876
Come on, let's go.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:46.418
Get back in the car.

01:12:51.209 --> 01:12:51.918
Come here.

01:12:52.084 --> 01:12:53.084
Come here.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.709
You need to listen to me.

01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:05.418
It's very important.

01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:09.043
Your life is in danger.

01:13:10.459 --> 01:13:11.584
Okay?

01:13:16.084 --> 01:13:17.959
I will take you to your house.

01:13:18.584 --> 01:13:21.584
You'll have five minutes
to get your family

01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:24.293
and leave ltuango.

01:13:24.459 --> 01:13:25.918
Leave ltuango.

01:13:30.501 --> 01:13:32.293
Why?

01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:33.543
Look.

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:41.834
This... is a lot of money.

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.418
A lot of money for you
and your family.

01:13:44.584 --> 01:13:46.584
But you have to leave, Martin!

01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:48.501
You have to leave right now!

01:13:50.168 --> 01:13:52.043
I knew it, brother.

01:13:53.376 --> 01:13:56.418
There's treasure in those boxes, huh?

01:13:56.584 --> 01:13:58.626
No, no, no. You have to forget.

01:14:00.209 --> 01:14:02.209
How am I supposed to forget this?
This is a treasure.

01:14:02.793 --> 01:14:04.709
Listen to me, Martin!

01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:07.084
You have to leave ltuango now!

01:14:08.959 --> 01:14:11.168
Please, understand me, Martin!

01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:13.876
Please, listen to me!

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:29.959
Why do you want me to leave ltuango?

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:33.209
I don't want to leave ltuango.

01:14:33.876 --> 01:14:35.293
I have family.

01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:38.168
I have friends.

01:14:38.334 --> 01:14:39.668
I work.

01:14:39.918 --> 01:14:41.334
No, I can't leave here.

01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:43.959
I can't leave ltuango.

01:14:46.209 --> 01:14:49.959
Thanks, but there's no way.

01:14:50.626 --> 01:14:51.751
Keep them.

01:14:54.876 --> 01:14:56.834
Thank you.

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.751
With this,

01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:03.043
I'll buy my son

01:15:03.209 --> 01:15:05.959
some really nice clothes.

01:15:07.793 --> 01:15:11.251
And for my wife,
I'm going to buy her a huge bed.

01:15:11.418 --> 01:15:13.543
So she'll feel like a princess.

01:15:15.918 --> 01:15:17.001
Thank you.

01:15:19.376 --> 01:15:20.668
Do you wanna drive?

01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:23.584
You sure?

01:15:25.543 --> 01:15:28.584
Yeah. Just go around the car.

01:15:29.293 --> 01:15:30.376
Alright.

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:34.584
Finally I'm going to drive.

01:15:39.543 --> 01:15:43.543
With this,
I'll even get myself a gift.

01:15:44.293 --> 01:15:46.293
Maybe even buy myself a car one day.

01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:18.709
Stop! I'm trying to help you!
I'm trying to help you!

01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:26.459
You have to leave!

01:16:26.626 --> 01:16:29.959
You have to take your family
and leave!

01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:31.543
Do you understand me?

01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:34.084
I will kill you!
I swear to God, I will kill you!

01:16:34.626 --> 01:16:35.918
Do you understand me?

01:17:16.293 --> 01:17:17.501
Which way?

01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:18.876
Which way?

01:17:19.043 --> 01:17:20.334
Left.

01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:27.168
Let's

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:44.834
I need another way.

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:47.751
Right.

01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:52.584
You have five minutes
o get your family and get out.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:53.834
Do you understand?

01:17:54.001 --> 01:17:54.918
Yes.

01:18:02.543 --> 01:18:05.668
- Where is your house?
-This is my house.

01:18:07.334 --> 01:18:10.001
- Do you have a phone?
-No, but there's one in the hotel.

01:18:10.293 --> 01:18:13.084
You go up and start.
I'll be there in five minutes. Go!

01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.251
Don't be stupid, I'm watching you.

01:18:15.918 --> 01:18:16.834
Go!

01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:24.084
Yeah, I found him on the street

01:18:24.293 --> 01:18:27.626
and you know
how his wife is really sick.

01:18:28.959 --> 01:18:32.043
Yeah, his wife is real sick
and he's real sad.

01:18:32.334 --> 01:18:33.334
Yes.

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:37.209
- Yes, please.
-Well then, I'll call you later.

01:18:38.668 --> 01:18:40.084
You can use the phone.

01:18:40.626 --> 01:18:41.626
Thank you.

01:18:55.376 --> 01:18:56.376
- Nick?
Maria.

01:18:56.543 --> 01:18:58.584
Listen I think I'm in trouble, ok.
I couldn't...

01:18:58.751 --> 01:18:59.668
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:19:00.043 --> 01:19:03.501
I'm so happy to hear your voice!

01:19:05.293 --> 01:19:07.168
Calm down. What's going on?

01:19:07.834 --> 01:19:09.751
Everybody was shot today.

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:13.543
Juanita's father called
her and told her

01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:17.293
<i>that you were with him
and Felipe and Juan...</i>

01:19:17.751 --> 01:19:21.626
And now they are all dead, Nick!
I thought you were dead!

01:19:23.293 --> 01:19:25.334
I thought you were dead, Nick!

01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.543
Maria,

01:19:59.709 --> 01:20:02.418
I need you to listen to me
and don't think I'm crazy, ok?

01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:06.251
I think that Pablo
is trying to kill me.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:09.043
- What are you talking about?
-I don't have time to explain.

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:10.376
<i>You need to get out
of the house right now.</i>

01:20:10.626 --> 01:20:12.876
It's not safe.

01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:35.584
Martin de la Pena Vasquez.

01:20:36.543 --> 01:20:38.709
At last we meet. A pleasure.

01:20:47.418 --> 01:20:48.834
Where's the gringo?

01:20:49.876 --> 01:20:51.959
If you tell me, I'll let you live.

01:20:52.126 --> 01:20:54.293
So you can give your family
a decent funeral.

01:20:55.334 --> 01:20:57.001
If you don't, I'll kill you.

01:20:58.418 --> 01:20:59.751
Let's meet in Bogota.

01:20:59.918 --> 01:21:02.459
Tomorrow morning at 9 AM
in front of the Canadian Embassy.

01:21:02.626 --> 01:21:06.043
<i>There's a Church across from
the embassy, let's meet there at 9 AM.</i>

01:21:06.626 --> 01:21:08.418
I'll be there, I promise.

01:21:10.043 --> 01:21:11.543
I'm scared, Nick.

01:21:12.584 --> 01:21:13.418
<i>Me too.</i>

01:21:14.793 --> 01:21:16.376
I love you so much.

01:21:17.834 --> 01:21:19.084
I love you too.

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:30.543
"They decided to take Mowgli
to the men immediately.

01:21:31.293 --> 01:21:35.293
From here on out,
you'll take care of yourself.

01:21:35.459 --> 01:21:37.834
As Mowgli got up
and left the jungle..."

01:21:44.876 --> 01:21:45.876
Hello. Who's there?

01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:47.501
I wanna speak to him.

01:21:48.543 --> 01:21:50.334
<i>Speak to me. Where are you?</i>

01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:52.084
I wanna speak to him now.

01:21:52.251 --> 01:21:54.626
<i>L wanna know why all the men
that left with me are dead.</i>

01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:56.376
Why aren't you calling
from the restaurant?

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:03.668
How do you know I'm not calling
from the restaurant?

01:22:05.376 --> 01:22:07.959
Because no one has called you
to confirm they've killed me yet.

01:22:09.126 --> 01:22:10.209
<i>Is that it?</i>

01:22:12.543 --> 01:22:14.668
- Are you <i>still</i> there?
- I thought you said it.

01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:17.584
I didn't say shit. Put Pablo Escobar
on the phone right now.

01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:19.793
You can tell him
his treasure's in danger.

01:22:19.959 --> 01:22:22.459
"When Mowgli stopped to rest,

01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:25.876
a happy bear wandered over,

01:22:26.043 --> 01:22:27.126
named Baloo.

01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:29.876
Baloo figured that the elephant

01:22:30.043 --> 01:22:32.126
-had much to learn..."
-Excuse me, patron.

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:38.543
There's a little problem
with the Canadian.

01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:40.584
He never made it to the restaurant.

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.834
Darling, you know who's calling?

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:06.793
Nick, Maria's boyfriend.
Do you want to talk to him?

01:23:06.959 --> 01:23:09.084
Ask him where he is. And tell him

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:12.543
we thought we lost him in the jungle,
like Mowgli.

01:23:15.001 --> 01:23:15.668
Nick,

01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:19.334
<i>where are you? You got lost
in the jungle lost like Mowgli?</i>

01:23:19.501 --> 01:23:22.334
No. I'm not lost.
Can I speak with your dad, please?

01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:24.709
We're drawing
the animal from the hacienda

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:25.709
I know, I know.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.793
And I'm going to draw you too.

01:23:28.959 --> 01:23:30.584
I need to speak
to your daddy right now.

01:23:35.293 --> 01:23:37.209
What's up, Nico? Everything good?

01:23:38.459 --> 01:23:39.709
You want me dead?

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:45.584
Where are you, man?

01:23:45.959 --> 01:23:48.501
Pablo, the man that answered
the phone made a mistake.

01:23:48.668 --> 01:23:51.459
How could he know
I wasn't calling from the restaurant?

01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:53.626
Who's over there waiting for me?

01:23:54.084 --> 01:23:55.251
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:23:55.876 --> 01:24:00.168
Nick, when you was a kid,
did you read The Jungle Book?

01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:02.834
- Stop this bullshit and answer me!
- I am answering you, <i>Nick.</i>

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.501
Just listen.

01:24:05.251 --> 01:24:09.459
Remember the end? When he leaves
his friends in the jungle

01:24:10.293 --> 01:24:12.626
and goes to the village
where the humans are?

01:24:13.501 --> 01:24:15.876
Well, today I am Mowgli.

01:24:16.834 --> 01:24:18.293
Unfortunately...

01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:21.959
<i>you're one of those friends
that I have to leave behind.</i>

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:27.501
You said I was like a son to you.

01:24:27.918 --> 01:24:31.876
Nick, there are laws of nature
and once they take control,

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.376
you have to accept them.

01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:48.626
Yes.

01:24:48.793 --> 01:24:50.793
The man is not coming
to the restaurant.

01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:52.959
He's somewhere outside.

01:24:53.418 --> 01:24:54.251
<i>Cap y, Drago.</i>

01:25:02.418 --> 01:25:04.168
Get out of there and come over here.

01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:14.168
I see Drago.

01:25:14.459 --> 01:25:17.168
Just say hello.

01:25:18.043 --> 01:25:20.043
<i>Nick, Maria is gonna be fine.</i>

01:25:27.001 --> 01:25:28.543
- Please, help me.
-The way out is back there.

01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:29.834
I know, I know, please.

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.001
Please.

01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:34.751
- Open.
-The exit is back there.

01:25:34.959 --> 01:25:36.126
Please, please.

01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:43.043
It's a different key.

01:25:48.959 --> 01:25:50.959
Where the hell are you going?
There's no exit over there.

01:25:51.126 --> 01:25:52.543
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:41.001
- Have you seen the gringo?
-Yes.

01:26:41.168 --> 01:26:43.293
- How long ago?
-He left this way a minute ago.

01:26:44.168 --> 01:26:45.584
Sit down and don't move.

01:27:49.418 --> 01:27:53.126
The man is nearby.
Go check the houses over there.

01:27:57.043 --> 01:27:59.418
<i>Allo? Patron.</i>

01:28:00.918 --> 01:28:03.251
He escaped
when I was about to catch him.

01:28:06.376 --> 01:28:08.834
I'm going to ask the police for help.

01:28:13.626 --> 01:28:17.168
Don't worry, patron. Trust us.
He's not going to escape us.

01:28:26.168 --> 01:28:27.001
Don't worry.

01:28:34.084 --> 01:28:36.001
I've already checked the car.

01:28:36.168 --> 01:28:38.584
Go check the hotel,
the houses on the block.

01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:43.251
Get going!

01:28:47.834 --> 01:28:50.251
Captain, this is Drago Gutierrez.

01:28:50.418 --> 01:28:53.293
I need a few men here
to close a perimeter around ltuango.

01:28:54.959 --> 01:28:58.751
Send quite a few men. To return
the favor to the boss, is that clear?

01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:04.584
We're looking for a gringo!

01:29:06.043 --> 01:29:07.209
He's dangerous!

01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:11.668
This gringo is an enemy
of Pablo Escobar!

01:29:14.168 --> 01:29:15.459
Don't hide him!

01:29:18.043 --> 01:29:19.709
Don't help the gringo!

01:29:21.876 --> 01:29:24.334
If he gets into your house,
get him out.

01:29:25.918 --> 01:29:29.376
This gringo is an enemy
of Pablo Escobar!

01:30:27.209 --> 01:30:29.459
Come on, let's go!

01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:05.751
Good afternoon, captain.

01:31:07.084 --> 01:31:08.959
He's hiding out somewhere around here.

01:31:09.126 --> 01:31:10.626
We'll look for him.

01:31:10.918 --> 01:31:14.459
- We have to find him, and kill him.
-Ok, we'll kill him.

01:31:15.043 --> 01:31:17.126
Look in that house over there.

01:31:17.293 --> 01:31:20.418
Over here, and up there.
Hurry before he escapes.

01:31:27.793 --> 01:31:30.043
You are the man of the family.

01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:32.584
Your priority is to take care
of your mom

01:31:32.751 --> 01:31:36.334
-and your little sister.
-Yes, sir.

01:31:38.918 --> 01:31:40.168
For you, Papa-

01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:49.043
Take care of yourself.
You know that we need you.

01:31:49.209 --> 01:31:51.584
Don't worry, my love.

01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:53.751
The hard part is over.

01:31:55.501 --> 01:31:57.626
I'll be safe, don't worry.

01:31:58.793 --> 01:32:00.334
You look nice in that.

It's very important.

01:38:59.918 --> 01:39:00.876
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:39:01.043 --> 01:39:03.334
Anne, are you listening to me?
I need to talk to Dylan now!

01:39:03.501 --> 01:39:05.918
<i>Sorry, Nick. He's not here.</i>

01:39:07.126 --> 01:39:10.293
You need to take the baby, get my brother
and get out there, ok? It's not safe!

01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:12.376
Your lives are in danger!
Do you understand me?

I need to know where you are, please.
Just tell me.

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.334
Tell me where you are.

01:39:32.043 --> 01:39:34.334
I need you to tell me something.

01:39:35.376 --> 01:39:36.418
Are you alone?

01:39:39.834 --> 01:39:41.793
No, no.

01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:47.418
Is my brother okay?

01:39:49.876 --> 01:39:51.001
No.

01:39:52.834 --> 01:39:54.501
<i>Anne, please, talk to me.</i>

Come on, tell me.

01:40:00.543 --> 01:40:01.751
I'm sorry.

01:40:03.209 --> 01:40:04.584
<i>Anne talk to me. What's going on?</i>

01:40:04.751 --> 01:40:05.834
I can't.

01:40:06.543 --> 01:40:09.251
<i>You need to tell me
what's happening.</i>

01:40:10.459 --> 01:40:12.584
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

01:40:13.918 --> 01:40:16.376
What's the matter with Dylan?
Where is he?

01:40:17.459 --> 01:40:19.334
Anne... Anne!

01:40:20.001 --> 01:40:21.501
Anne, talk to me! Please!

01:40:22.084 --> 01:40:23.959
Anne, listen to me! Where is Dylan?

01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:26.543
God!

01:41:18.459 --> 01:41:21.709
Make sure everyone
gets a little bit of money.

01:41:23.876 --> 01:41:24.543
Come on.

01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:27.209
Make sure everyone
gets a little bit of money.

01:41:49.793 --> 01:41:51.501
Why?

01:41:53.418 --> 01:41:56.834
- Tell me, patron.
-Get Maria out of here.

01:41:57.001 --> 01:41:58.959
- Why?
-Get her out here.

01:42:00.834 --> 01:42:03.084
Where is she? I don't see her.

01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:01.501
Where do you think you're going, Nico?

01:45:04.084 --> 01:45:06.084
No one escapes Pablo Escobar.

01:45:12.043 --> 01:45:13.334
I will kill you,

01:45:15.751 --> 01:45:17.376
as we killed your brother.

01:46:37.834 --> 01:46:39.626
<i>Drago, what happened with Nico?</i>

01:46:43.251 --> 01:46:44.751
I'm still alive.

01:46:48.251 --> 01:46:49.043
<i>Nick?</i>

01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:53.834
<i>Nico?</i>

01:47:10.459 --> 01:47:13.501
Pablo, it's time to go.

01:47:16.584 --> 01:47:19.668
You made a deal, Pablo.
You have to go.

01:47:23.168 --> 01:47:24.584
Did you want the blessing?

01:47:35.668 --> 01:47:36.959
Affirmative.

01:47:38.793 --> 01:47:42.793
May the strength of God Almighty
and the Holy Spirit guide you

01:47:43.168 --> 01:47:45.293
in the decision you made.

01:47:53.293 --> 01:47:56.209
I will ask the Lord
to keep an eye on you.

01:48:10.626 --> 01:48:13.834
When you talk to God,

01:48:14.001 --> 01:48:15.709
the Almighty,

01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:19.876
remind Him how much I do
for His church...

01:48:20.918 --> 01:48:23.418
and for the poor of Medellin.

01:48:23.626 --> 01:48:25.251
And tell Him

01:48:26.043 --> 01:48:29.543
that today I saw my family
for the first time

01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:32.709
after months of solitude and distress.

01:48:33.793 --> 01:48:36.418
And I probably won't see them
for a long time.

01:48:40.959 --> 01:48:43.793
He seems a bit distracted lately.

01:48:53.001 --> 01:48:56.126
You tell Him, Father,

01:48:56.293 --> 01:49:00.293
that I'll have a powerful telescope...

01:49:02.459 --> 01:49:04.793
pointed to the sky.

01:49:06.126 --> 01:49:08.001
And from time to time,

01:49:08.168 --> 01:49:10.959
when I'll remember His existence,

01:49:12.209 --> 01:49:17.126
I, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

01:49:17.293 --> 01:49:19.376
will keep my eye on Him.

01:49:22.834 --> 01:49:25.418
Forgive me, Father.

01:49:28.876 --> 01:49:30.501
And God bless you.

01:50:37.543 --> 01:50:39.168
What happened?

01:50:49.751 --> 01:50:51.334
No. Please.

01:50:52.168 --> 01:50:53.584
No! Please!

01:50:58.793 --> 01:51:00.001
Please! Nick!

01:51:02.043 --> 01:51:04.668
- Stay, stay.
-No, I'll be back.

01:51:04.959 --> 01:51:05.959
I'll be back.

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:07.668
Please!

01:51:11.543 --> 01:51:12.918
Help!

01:51:18.751 --> 01:51:20.668
Help, please!

01:51:20.834 --> 01:51:23.043
There is wounded man!

01:51:37.834 --> 01:51:38.584
Nick!

01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:40.209
Nick, run!

01:51:41.959 --> 01:51:43.834
Nick, run!

01:52:50.251 --> 01:52:52.168
This is something, hum?
