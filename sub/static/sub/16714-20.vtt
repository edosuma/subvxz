WEBVTT

00:07.080 --> 00:08.786
Previously on Criminal Minds...

00:11.670 --> 00:12.785
What is it?

00:12.790 --> 00:13.779
It was me.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.451
I was stabbing her.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.876
I killed her.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.166
His brain is constructing
a false narrative.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.070
Sometimes a manufactured memory

00:23.080 --> 00:24.490
is better than no memory at all.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.115
If Reid can swear under oath

00:26.120 --> 00:27.872
that he saw Scratch in that motel room,

00:27.880 --> 00:30.201
then we're a go putting him
on the terror watch list.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.708
I hear a noise,
like a spraying sound,

00:33.710 --> 00:34.870
and I feel a mist,

00:34.880 --> 00:36.279
so I turn.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.951
Do you recognize who it is?

00:37.960 --> 00:39.746
It wasn't Scratch who framed me.

00:42.290 --> 00:45.327
It was a woman.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.570
A woman?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.957
Yeah. He was very clear about it.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.827
He remembered her hair,
her painted fingernails.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.286
So she killed Nadie Ramos.

00:53.290 --> 00:55.030
Yes. He says he saw her do it.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.166
Okay, but what about Scratch?

00:56.170 --> 00:59.788
He says he remembers her spraying
some kind of fine mist in his face.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.701
Which is consistent with Scratch's M.O.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.873
Right. Be he does not recall
seeing Scratch at all.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.030
You're sure this memory is accurate?

01:08.040 --> 01:10.452
You said he manufactured a false memory

01:10.460 --> 01:11.609
earlier in the cognitive.

01:11.620 --> 01:15.374
And he is sleep deprived,
which can interfere with memory.

01:15.380 --> 01:18.998
Right, that's true, but that false memory
was directly related to the stress

01:19.000 --> 01:20.206
he's currently experiencing.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.826
This was different. He was not projecting.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.287
Look, in my opinion,
this is a credible recollection.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.821
Okay, so that could mean that Scratch
is manipulating another victim

01:29.830 --> 01:32.822
suffering from
dissociative identity disorder.

01:32.830 --> 01:35.958
Or he's working with a full-fledged
accomplice for the first time.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.997
What woman would willingly
associate herself with Scratch?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.616
And why would Scratch
risk taking on a partner?

01:41.620 --> 01:42.996
That's what we need to find out.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.820
We'll start by checking all of the women

01:44.830 --> 01:47.321
in the database we compiled
of D.I.D. patients.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.576
Wait, how was he?

01:49.580 --> 01:51.821
He's, um, he's having a hard time.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.990
We gotta get him out of there, you guys.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.537
We will, but right now it's late,

01:56.540 --> 01:58.451
and we're no good to him running on fumes.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.530
Clear your heads,
get some rest if you can.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.110
We'll start fresh in the morning.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.872
Thought you said we should start fresh
in the morning.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.780
So what are you still doing here?

02:13.670 --> 02:14.819
Same as you.

02:37.830 --> 02:39.570
Sorry I'm late.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.741
Mmm-hmm.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.114
Is it a new case?

02:46.620 --> 02:48.497
Nope. It's Reid's.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.910
Scratch is playing games.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.956
Well, that's what he does. You know that.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.667
Yeah, but they brought me in to catch him.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.036
I'm further away from it now
than when I started.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.452
I work with Scratch's victims every day.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.076
They're my colleagues, my friends.

03:03.080 --> 03:08.074
It makes working at the BAU more, uh,
I don't know...

03:08.080 --> 03:09.536
More raw than what I'm used to.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.160
Is this your way of saying

03:12.170 --> 03:15.207
you want to leave the BAU
and go back to the BAP?

03:15.210 --> 03:18.202
No, it's my way of saying I want to catch
this son of a bitch

03:18.210 --> 03:21.418
Good. 'Cause late or not,

03:21.420 --> 03:24.321
I am getting used to having you home
at night,

03:24.330 --> 03:29.245
instead of Slqping you in Moscow,

03:29.250 --> 03:32.458
Berlin, Ankara.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.166
Mmm.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.667
You know what I think?

03:39.670 --> 03:41.319
What do you think?

03:41.580 --> 03:45.573
I think you need
to figure out a way to cope

03:45.580 --> 03:47.787
with all this stress...

03:49.170 --> 03:53.038
...you're putting on
these big broad shoulders.

03:53.620 --> 03:56.077
-All right, you got any ideas?
-Yeah.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.786
-You do?
-Uh-huh.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.496
Mmm.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.115
Where are the kids?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.872
Well, Maya's spending
the night at Olivia's,

04:04.170 --> 04:06.161
and Eli's asleep.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.535
Mmm.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.417
Mmm.

04:11.420 --> 04:14.571
- -Mmm.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.036
Mmm-mmm.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.167
Honey, don't move.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.786
Walker.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.911
I'll be right there.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.820
That was National Memorial Hospital.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.741
Sam's been admitted through the ER.

04:32.210 --> 04:34.110
Well, is he okay?

04:34.120 --> 04:38.284
I don't know. They just told me
to come on down there.

04:38.290 --> 04:40.827
Ever since the divorce,
I'm his emergency contact.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.377
Just go.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.415
Yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.206
Call you when I know something.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.667
Okay, okay.

05:03.670 --> 05:07.162
Quick toast to mark
this momentous occasion.

05:07.420 --> 05:10.617
To Stephen and Sam being on U.S. soil

05:10.620 --> 05:13.032
at the same time.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.109
Cheers. Hear, hear.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.202
All right! We got 'em.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.246
Awesome.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.413
And, uh, here's to
no cloak and dagger talk.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.456
No mention of cultivating human assets

05:23.460 --> 05:25.166
or counter-intelligence.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.570
Or who's in and who's out at the FSB.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.320
All right, hey, we're not that bad.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.740
Which reminds me,

05:30.750 --> 05:32.741
Petrov got promoted.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.321
Stop, you guys are incorrigible,
both of you.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.035
MOSCOW, RUSSIA
2013

07:35.290 --> 07:36.416
Hey.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.285
Hello.

07:38.290 --> 07:39.996
Sorry to drag you out here.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.036
It's no trouble, man. What happened?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.110
Went for a walk during lunch.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.281
On the way back to the office,
I felt sick,

07:46.920 --> 07:48.205
collapsed.

07:48.210 --> 07:51.998
Someone called 911
saying I had a heart attack.

07:52.620 --> 07:56.499
You?
You ran a marathon in October.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.489
I know.

07:57.790 --> 07:58.950
They sure about that?

07:59.290 --> 08:00.609
Seems like it.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.372
They called it a cardiac incident.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.666
Okay. You feel any pain in your left arm?

08:04.670 --> 08:05.785
No.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.416
Any shortness of breath?

08:08.420 --> 08:09.705
No, man, nothing like that.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.076
It doesn't make sense.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.245
You think any of this might have to do

08:14.250 --> 08:15.569
with your work with the BAP?

08:16.210 --> 08:17.700
What, the Russian stuff?

08:17.710 --> 08:18.995
Yes.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.821
I'm working a desk
in D.C. For the BAP now.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.616
I haven't been in Moscow in over a year.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.666
It's not that long ago.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.956
I had a heart attack, Steve.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.112
You just collapsed.
No warning, no symptoms.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.246
Yeah.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.075
Well, no. I...

08:36.080 --> 08:38.662
There was something. I felt something.

08:38.670 --> 08:40.570
A pinch in my lower back.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.706
In your back? Let me see.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.239
Seriously?

08:44.250 --> 08:45.410
Roll over, man.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.416
See anything you like?

08:54.580 --> 08:55.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.416
Don't come any closer.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.285
You get a hazmat team down here right now.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.451
I think he's been dosed
with something toxic.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.280
What?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.535
Is it radiation?

10:37.580 --> 10:39.616
"The past is never
where you think you left it."

10:39.620 --> 10:41.872
Katherine Anne Porter.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.702
This one hits close to home.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.531
Stephen's friend from the BAP, Sam Bower,

10:48.540 --> 10:50.872
was hospitalized yesterday
after being poisoned.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.200
What kind of poison?

10:52.210 --> 10:53.871
That's still unknown,
but there's a whole team

10:53.880 --> 10:55.279
of doctors trying to figure it out.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.917
Stephen was with him at the hospital.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.036
Initial symptoms mimicked a heart attack.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.749
But whatever it is, it was irradiated.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.036
Wait, an irradiated poison?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.371
What's the prognosis?

11:06.380 --> 11:08.951
Right now it's wait, see,
and hope for the best.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.996
He's already showing signs
of radiation sickness,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.240
which is all kinds of terrible.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.706
Was Stephen contaminated?

11:13.710 --> 11:15.246
His exposure was minimal.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.877
They put him through
decontamination protocol

11:16.880 --> 11:18.029
and he's about to be cleared.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.496
What do we know about Sam Bower?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.615
Uh, 54 years old.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.168
Recently went through
an acrimonious divorce about a year ago.

11:23.170 --> 11:26.537
He has one adult son who's a sophomore
at Emory University in Atlanta.

11:26.540 --> 11:30.169
Our biggest suspect pool
comes from his work at the BAP.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.991
In the field,
he was primarily stationed in Russia

11:33.000 --> 11:34.615
and he worked in counter-intelligence.

11:34.620 --> 11:37.077
He could make a lot of enemies
in that line of work.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.661
I hate to raise the possibility,

11:38.670 --> 11:41.491
but because of the victim's
connection to Stephen,

11:41.500 --> 11:43.036
should we consider Scratch?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.372
Scratch always attacks through family.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.995
If he'd wanted to get to Walker,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.161
he would have gone
right for Monica and the kids.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.377
The KGB and the FSB are both notorious

11:51.380 --> 11:53.200
for poisoning enemies of the state.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.826
Absolutely correct.
And that goes all the way back

11:55.830 --> 11:57.661
to the original Vladimir Lenin.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.821
In 1918, he survived
an assassination attempt

12:00.830 --> 12:02.786
when he found out that
the bullets used to shoot him

12:02.790 --> 12:04.451
were dipped in poison, he became obsessed.

12:04.460 --> 12:07.952
He started a secret lab
called the "special room."

12:07.960 --> 12:09.825
Its sole purpose was to weaponize

12:09.830 --> 12:12.822
poisonous substances
to assassinate people anonymously.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.617
And that lab still exists to this day.
Putin uses it.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.703
Yes. Litvinenko's 2006 poisoning

12:18.710 --> 12:21.372
from polonium-210 is the most famous
in recent history,

12:21.380 --> 12:23.575
but cyanide, dioxin, thallium,

12:23.580 --> 12:25.377
sodium fluoride, those have all been used

12:25.380 --> 12:27.109
as murder weapons by Russian operatives.

12:27.460 --> 12:28.779
Quite a repertoire.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.746
Those are just the ones
that have been identified.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.742
Poison breaks down very quickly,
so it's incredibly hard to trace,

12:33.750 --> 12:35.456
especially when it's masked
by other symptoms.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.702
Bower was primarily involved
in cultivating human assets,

12:38.710 --> 12:40.246
with an emphasis on the intersection

12:40.250 --> 12:42.741
of Russian business graft
and political corruption.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.206
What was his cover?

12:44.210 --> 12:45.825
He was working as
an American entrepreneur

12:45.830 --> 12:46.956
trying to garner Russian capital.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.609
His cover might have been blown.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.282
Or maybe he was onto something bigger
than he realized.

12:52.790 --> 12:56.203
Walker's on it.
Let's see what else we can find.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.161
I swear to you, I'm fine.

12:59.580 --> 13:00.911
But are you sure?

13:00.920 --> 13:02.285
One thousand percent.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.076
You are not getting rid of me that easy.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.241
Don't even joke. Should I call Lisa

13:06.250 --> 13:07.706
and tell her what's going on with Sam?

13:07.710 --> 13:10.167
Well, I'm not so sure he's ready for Lisa.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.785
What about Zach?

13:12.620 --> 13:14.747
He sided with his mom after the divorce.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.877
Let me talk to Sam and get back to you.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.451
And don't worry about me.
I'll be home soon.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.115
No, I'm...

13:23.120 --> 13:25.918
Why?

13:25.920 --> 13:28.115
On Thursday?

13:28.120 --> 13:30.782
No, no, no.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.958
Meeting in St. Petersburg.

13:35.420 --> 13:37.285
SochL

14:03.540 --> 14:05.781
Pardon me. Didn't we meet

14:05.790 --> 14:07.166
in St. Petersburg last year?

14:07.830 --> 14:09.377
I believe it was Sochi.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.747
Right. Sochi.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.951
- -Any word from Mark?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.996
Not yet, but this might be him now.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.321
No, it's Fiona, Spencer's lavwer.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.877
His trial's been pushed back.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.416
That's not gonna sit well with him.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.701
I know. She's going up
to tell him in person.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.780
Walker's calling in right now.

14:40.790 --> 14:42.610
Prentiss and Rossi are here.
You are on speaker.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.700
Talk to me, smooth operator.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.377
Do you practice those
or do they just come to you?

14:46.380 --> 14:47.665
You inspire me.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.706
Listen, I need you to track down

14:49.710 --> 14:52.031
a Russian national named Dmitri Sobchek.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.996
He was an asset in Moscow.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.662
He was a quiet but persistent
opponent of corruption

14:56.670 --> 14:57.876
in the Russian government.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.609
He's not in Russia anymore.

14:59.620 --> 15:03.204
He's in our own backyard.
He's working as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill

15:03.210 --> 15:04.780
for Russian oil interests.

15:04.790 --> 15:07.577
Sobchek's name came up
in one of Bower's current files

15:07.580 --> 15:09.491
as the subject of investigation

15:09.500 --> 15:12.287
into the bribery of certain members
of Congress.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.372
We should talk to him.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.611
You don't seem surprised to hear
that Bower was poisoned.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.451
That's because it is not surprising.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.076
These kinds of poisonings are common.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.786
But you had nothing to do with it.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.496
Correct.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.450
You bribing congressmen?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.788
If I am, I do that
with the blessing of my government.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.826
And they will protect me.

15:37.830 --> 15:40.879
It is the American politicians that have
to worry about that.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.950
But you used to be
one of the biggest critics

15:42.960 --> 15:44.245
of the corruption in Putin's government.

15:44.250 --> 15:48.118
Times change. Integrity is no longer
a luxury I can afford.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.667
Why is that?

15:49.670 --> 15:52.036
Corruption in Russia
sanctioned from the top down.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.827
People who make waves tend to disappear,

15:54.830 --> 15:56.377
one way or another.

15:56.670 --> 15:58.956
I have a wife and two kids
out in Arlington.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.036
It's a good life.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.031
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.780
Call it what you want.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.611
I wouldn't risk all I have to poison
an FBI agent.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.373
And if I did,
I'd already be back in Russia.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.031
I wouldn't be sitting around here
waiting to be arrested.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.371
Thanks.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.496
A continuance

16:24.500 --> 16:26.240
-Six weeks.
-I don't understand.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.990
The Alexandria District Court
is the rocket docket.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.319
I know. But there are delays

16:29.330 --> 16:30.991
because of the arresting
officers' limited availability.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.707
Because they have to travel
from Mexico to Virginia?

16:33.710 --> 16:35.917
And because they have domestic
testimony obligations.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.456
This is the price we're paying

16:37.460 --> 16:39.610
for getting the case
moved back to the States.

16:41.380 --> 16:45.032
I'm working directly with the warden
on getting extra visiting privileges.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.076
I don't know ifI can...

16:47.080 --> 16:48.570
Spencer, listen to me.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.071
There is a strategic silver lining here.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.036
These extra six weeks give the BAU time

16:53.040 --> 16:54.667
to track down the woman
that you remembered.

16:54.670 --> 16:56.114
Have they made any progress?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.530
They're pouring everything
they have into locating her.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.167
And now that you remember that big detail

16:59.170 --> 17:00.819
that the other person
in the room was a woman...

17:00.830 --> 17:02.161
I might remember more.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.115
I know how hard this is,

17:04.120 --> 17:06.611
but our best hope is exonerating you
before a verdict.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.919
And these six weeks could be
a blessing in disguise.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.611
Dmitri Sobchek
isn't looking good for this.

17:13.620 --> 17:16.532
He doesn't have a motive and his alibi
seems to check out.

17:16.540 --> 17:17.996
Okay, well,
unfortunately there's nobody else

17:18.000 --> 17:20.286
that crossed paths with Bower
that could be a fit for this.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.497
It seems like we're right back
where we started.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.458
Well, if Sam Bower
wasn't targeted specifically,

17:25.460 --> 17:27.200
we might be off on our victimology.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.700
I mean, this could be broader
than just him.

17:28.710 --> 17:31.201
Stephen said Sam's condition is worsening.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.451
His pancreas is compromised

17:33.460 --> 17:34.996
and his kidneys are failing.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.491
Garcia, check hospitals
in the Beltway area

17:37.500 --> 17:39.240
and see if anyone else has been admitted

17:39.250 --> 17:42.663
with heart attack symptoms followed
by multiple organ failure.

17:44.290 --> 17:45.996
I got two names right off the bat.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.991
Both were admitted
the week before Sam Bower,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.410
and both of them are right here in D.C.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.456
Well, that means Sam is the third victim,

17:51.460 --> 17:53.530
and we're dealing with a serial killer.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.616
Are you okay?

18:22.620 --> 18:24.952
Somebody call 91 1.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.742
Like Sam Bower, our previous two victims
were also federal employees.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.493
Aidan O'Hara was an attorney, civil rights
division of the Department of Justice.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.162
Sharlene Jorif worked as an area manager,

18:41.170 --> 18:43.707
Bureau of Reclamation in the
Department of the Interior.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.871
And both died of multiple organ failure

18:45.880 --> 18:49.281
after initially presenting with symptoms
consistent with a heart attack.

18:49.290 --> 18:53.033
And it looks like all of them had
the poison injected into the lower back.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.281
All three of our victims worked in
federal buildings

18:55.290 --> 18:56.530
within a five-block radius.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.030
UnSub doesn't appear to have
a gender preference.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.076
And no specific preference for workplace

19:01.080 --> 19:02.286
other than the federal government.

19:02.290 --> 19:05.453
Different federal agencies,
but each victim held a position

19:05.460 --> 19:07.576
of significant authority and prestige.

19:07.830 --> 19:10.207
Looks like our UnSub has a beef
with the federal government.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.075
Oh, and speaking of our UnSub,

19:12.080 --> 19:14.287
looks like we got another victim,
Benjamin Vargas.

19:14.290 --> 19:15.666
Federal employee?

19:15.670 --> 19:18.878
Yeah, he works at the IRS as a janitor.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.530
I think it's time we deliver the profile.

19:25.210 --> 19:26.529
We're dealing with an UnSub

19:26.540 --> 19:29.282
who's inducing symptoms
consistent with a heart attack

19:29.290 --> 19:31.531
as a smokescreen for murder by poisoning.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.667
The initial symptoms soon give way

19:33.670 --> 19:35.069
to the true cause of death,

19:35.080 --> 19:37.071
which is an irradiated poison.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.038
Poisoning like this is an MD.
consistent with the Russian government.

19:40.330 --> 19:43.743
Except three out of the four victims
aren't typical Russian targets.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.377
This leads us to believe that this UnSub

19:45.380 --> 19:47.826
is mimicking a Russian espionage M.O.

19:47.830 --> 19:50.458
in order to obscure their true motive.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.917
And this UnSub falls into
one of three categories.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.457
First, an embittered federal employee,

19:55.460 --> 19:57.781
someone who was fired or forcibly retired

19:57.790 --> 19:59.496
or otherwise rendered obsolete.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.287
Second, someone who intends to profit

20:02.290 --> 20:04.326
off of marketing an antidote to the poison

20:04.330 --> 20:06.070
once positively identified.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.321
This would be an UnSub
similar to the perpetrator

20:08.330 --> 20:11.379
of the anthrax poisonings
immediately following 9/11.

20:11.790 --> 20:13.826
And that individual hoped to benefit

20:13.830 --> 20:15.115
from selling an anthrax antidote

20:15.120 --> 20:17.168
to vulnerable businesses
and the federal government.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.456
Or this could be an UnSub
with a personal grudge,

20:19.460 --> 20:21.951
which makes it totally unrelated
to the federal government.

20:22.330 --> 20:25.117
Someone who's using
a politically charged M.O.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.032
in order to mask _ _
a very personal motivation for kIllIng.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.457
Thi_s UnSub shares characteristics
wrth known product tamperers

20:31.460 --> 20:33.826
in that he's unconcerned
with collateral victims

20:33.830 --> 20:36.207
as long as they help
to obscure his target.

20:36.210 --> 20:39.828
Metro police will beef up security
in a five-block radius encompassing

20:39.830 --> 20:41.991
all the federal buildings
that are in question.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.571
They will also be advising
federal employees

20:44.580 --> 20:47.538
to be on the_lookout _ _ _
and report any SUSplClOUS actIVItIes.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.781
At this point, the UnSub has
no reason to believe

20:49.790 --> 20:51.576
that law enforcement is on to him.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.037
And we've decided
not to publicize the attacks.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.612
As we all know, publicity surrounding
these types of poisoning cases

20:57.620 --> 20:59.110
can inspire copycats.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.109
Thank you all.

21:16.380 --> 21:20.032
Damn, man, why are you even here?

21:20.040 --> 21:21.746
You could be playing Carnegie Hall.

21:22.210 --> 21:25.077
Monica would be all for it.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.322
And I gotta get back stateside for a time.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.070
How do you and Lisa make it work?

21:34.540 --> 21:36.826
I'm not sure we do.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.321
When's the last time you talked to her?

21:41.330 --> 21:42.706
It's been a while.

21:42.710 --> 21:47.249
She's got her hands full with Zach
and I'm not there.

21:48.830 --> 21:50.741
Well, I keep thinking
ifI stay here much longer,

21:50.750 --> 21:52.911
I won't have a family to go home to.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.035
Put in for a transfer.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.610
I thought you were going to.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.202
They won't approve both.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.609
Not at the same time.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.456
You put in first.

22:04.380 --> 22:06.416
No, I'm not gonna leave you hangin', man.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.785
Don't worry about me.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.199
You sure?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.872
Yeah.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.989
Well...

22:34.250 --> 22:36.912
I'm not the boy in the bubble anymore.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.660
Is that good news?

22:39.500 --> 22:42.412
It means the half-life
of the radiation used to poison you

22:42.420 --> 22:45.958
is very short. It was only 24 hours.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.160
You no longer present a risk

22:48.170 --> 22:50.320
of contamination to others.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.378
Whoo-hoo.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.824
Go me.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.781
You can fight this.

22:58.790 --> 23:00.417
You're strong.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.072
Who you trying to fool?

23:05.080 --> 23:06.786
Me or you?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.372
I gotta face facts.

23:09.380 --> 23:12.031
Blood transfusions aren't working.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.747
My liver's failing now.

23:14.750 --> 23:15.910
I know.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.575
Who did this to me?

23:22.670 --> 23:25.377
We don't know yet.

23:25.380 --> 23:27.371
But you're not the only person
who's been poisoned.

23:28.210 --> 23:30.280
Other BAP agents?

23:30.290 --> 23:33.248
No. It looks like this doesn't have
anything to do with Russia.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.779
What, the poisoning was...

23:35.790 --> 23:37.200
Fooled us, too, at first.

23:37.210 --> 23:39.417
Looks like that was just a smokescreen.

23:39.420 --> 23:41.615
So, what are you saying,

23:41.620 --> 23:43.872
I was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

23:45.500 --> 23:47.570
Something like that, yeah.

23:48.330 --> 23:51.413
Promise me you'll get the son of a bitch
who did this.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.200
I will.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.416
I promise.

23:57.290 --> 23:59.781
Wrong place, wrong time.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.872
Even Lisa will get a kick out of that.

24:05.380 --> 24:08.110
She always said I had rotten timing.

24:10.790 --> 24:14.078
I can call her, or Monica can.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.321
-Don't.
-Why not?

24:16.330 --> 24:18.241
It wouldn't be fair.

24:19.460 --> 24:22.497
None of this is fair, man.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.956
She would want to know.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.070
And she'd come back from California.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.570
I know she would.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.787
But we ran out of things
to say to each other

24:30.790 --> 24:32.997
a long time ago, and...

24:34.040 --> 24:36.531
I don't want her to see me like this.

24:38.290 --> 24:39.575
What about Zach?

24:43.670 --> 24:44.910
He's angry.

24:45.420 --> 24:46.910
He'll get over it.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.457
He shouldn't have to, not because of this.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.742
Hey, come on, man.
You gotta let me do something.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.741
I don't want you to be here alone.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.416
I'm not alone.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.610
You're here.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.376
What happened?

25:36.540 --> 25:38.167
Writing materials are contraband.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.956
The counselor wants me to keep a journal.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.279
Contraband is contraband. Doesn't matter

25:41.290 --> 25:43.611
what your touchy-feely
counselor has to say about it.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.326
Get on your feet. You got a visitor.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.991
You know that lady lawyer you got?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.820
She's the one that set this up
with the warden.

25:50.830 --> 25:51.990
Fiona?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.285
Yeah. She's got 'em all worried

25:53.290 --> 25:55.952
about some civil suit
over that beat down you got.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.370
You should thank her for this.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.416
I don't want to see
any VISItors right now.

25:59.420 --> 26:00.614
Spencer!

26:03.500 --> 26:04.785
Mom.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.036
What is this place?

26:12.040 --> 26:14.918
It's okay, Mom.
You're just here to visit me.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.035
Cassie told you.

26:16.040 --> 26:19.282
Cassie? I sent that girl packing.

26:19.290 --> 26:22.327
Rotten little thief.
She was stealing from me.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.615
Mom, Cassie's not a thief.

26:23.620 --> 26:26.373
-She takes really good care of you.
-She stole my underwear.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.320
And the good china.

26:28.330 --> 26:30.571
And I will not tolerate that behavior.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.662
Well, then, Mom, how did you get here?

26:32.670 --> 26:35.070
The new girl. What's her name?

26:35.960 --> 26:37.245
She's a real sweetheart.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.070
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.911
I saw a back staircase...

26:41.920 --> 26:43.569
-Mom, no.
-...down the hall.

26:43.580 --> 26:45.571
-Mom, Mom.
-Let me out.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.822
The door's locked!
I can't be locked in!

26:48.830 --> 26:51.207
You're not locked in.
You're not locked in. I am.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.030
You? No.

26:55.330 --> 26:56.410
No, not you.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.992
It's a misunderstanding
and it's going to be okay.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.825
What is this place?

27:01.830 --> 27:05.459
We're in the Milburn Federal
Correctional Facility.

27:06.170 --> 27:07.876
A prison?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.075
Yeah. It's where I'm incarcerated

27:10.080 --> 27:12.321
pending my murder trial.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.662
Because of Mexico?

27:17.830 --> 27:20.708
Yeah. Because of Mexico.

27:22.830 --> 27:24.821
This is all my fault.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.376
Thanks for coming down here.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.326
Looks like we've got our fifth victim.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.826
Sorry about your friend.

27:33.830 --> 27:34.956
Thanks, man.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.957
How you holding up?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.609
Like a shark, man,

27:39.620 --> 27:41.918
I just keep swimming forward.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.161
Of course. We're so glad you're okay.

27:44.170 --> 27:45.910
That makes two of us.

27:48.170 --> 27:50.377
Alex McLean was admitted through the ER.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.530
Same presenting symptoms
as the other victims?

27:52.540 --> 27:54.952
Yeah. Initially it appeared
he'd had a heart attack,

27:54.960 --> 27:58.282
but blood tests confirmed the presence
of an irradiated toxin in his system.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.076
So it's our UnSub.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.531
Only thing different here,

28:02.540 --> 28:04.747
he doesn't have a puncture site
on his back.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.873
So how was he poisoned
and why the change in MO?

28:07.880 --> 28:09.074
Exactly.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.490
Were his clothes contaminated?

28:10.500 --> 28:11.990
No.

28:12.330 --> 28:13.615
How's he doing?

28:13.620 --> 28:15.997
We're doing our best
to keep him comfortable,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.911
but he's starting to show
signs of radiation sickness

28:17.920 --> 28:19.035
just like the others.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.741
We're still trying to figure out
how he was contaminated.

28:21.750 --> 28:24.537
It is possible there's an injection site
somewhere other than his back?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.160
It's possible.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.161
I mean, a puncture site could be tiny.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.410
But so far we haven't found one.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.957
The other victims r_em_embered
feeling the Injection.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.373
This one didn't. I mean, he was just
heading back to his desk when he felt ill.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.416
What about his stomach contents?

28:37.710 --> 28:41.168
Is there a test or some way to tell
if they contain irradiated material?

28:42.330 --> 28:44.878
As you can see,
both the radiograph and pet scan

28:44.880 --> 28:47.326
show radioactive material
In hIS stomach lining.

28:47.620 --> 28:50.453
As for the pet scan, we didn't even need
to use the radio tracer.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.667
Because the radiation already
in his system

28:52.670 --> 28:54.615
functioned as the contrast dye.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.451
That's right. It's in his mouth,

28:56.460 --> 28:59.577
his esophagus, stomach,
and the entire length

28:59.580 --> 29:01.036
of his gastrointestinal tract.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.450
So he ate it.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.826
Yeah. We started a gastric emptying study,

29:04.830 --> 29:06.206
but that'll take a few days.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.325
He knows the person who poisoned him.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.416
That's why he wasn't injected.

29:12.790 --> 29:15.076
If every other victim
was injected in the back,

29:15.080 --> 29:16.616
that makes sense.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.668
They were strangers to the UnSub,

29:18.670 --> 29:20.114
and if they were to turn around,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.076
they wouldn't have known the assailant.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.117
But if Alex had turned around,
he'd have known the UnSub.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.372
We gotta find out who he ate lunch with.

29:30.330 --> 29:32.787
Nobody. I ate alone.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.111
Where?

29:35.120 --> 29:38.453
In the courtyard, outside my office.

29:38.460 --> 29:39.825
It was a beautiful day.

29:39.830 --> 29:41.206
And where did you buy lunch?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.956
I brown-bagged it, like always.

29:45.170 --> 29:46.455
Are you married?

29:46.790 --> 29:50.169
Yeah. I haven't called her yet.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.661
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

29:52.670 --> 29:54.740
Did your wife pack your lunch today?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.530
Every day for the last 12 years.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.786
Clear!

30:10.460 --> 30:11.916
Clear.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.490
-C|ear!
-C|ear!

30:26.880 --> 30:28.416
Lead-lined boxes.

30:28.420 --> 30:31.662
It's what hospitals use to store
high-contrast dyes for testing.

30:31.670 --> 30:34.537
Irradiated materials
with an extremely short half-life.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.610
Hey, we need hazmat in here now.

30:36.620 --> 30:40.249
All right! Set up a perimeter,
front and rear.

30:44.580 --> 30:46.116
There's no sign of Sara McLean.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.451
She's definitely our UnSub.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.202
There's radiation in the refrigerator,
on the counters, and in the sink.

30:50.210 --> 30:52.747
All right, if it's in the sink,
then it went down the drain.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.287
We need to evacuate this area immediately.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.872
Our UnSub is Sara McLean,
a 47-year-old registered nurse

30:58.880 --> 31:00.416
married to victim number five.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.411
Looks like she gained access

31:02.420 --> 31:04.570
to the irradiated materials
through her work

31:04.580 --> 31:06.286
in the nuclear medical departments

31:06.290 --> 31:08.781
of 15 different hospitals
within the Beltway

31:08.790 --> 31:10.166
over the last nine years.

31:10.170 --> 31:12.821
She's been stockpiling
stolen irradiated material

31:12.830 --> 31:14.741
for nearly a decade and nobody noticed?

31:14.750 --> 31:16.706
No, she changed jobs frequently,

31:16.710 --> 31:18.780
and she didn't steal
from every hospital she worked at.

31:18.790 --> 31:20.917
All the hospitals she worked at
have been notified.

31:21.670 --> 31:23.570
Any of these places have
her flagged as a problem?

31:23.580 --> 31:25.320
No. She was never even fired.
She just quit.

31:25.620 --> 31:28.532
So far, four of the facilities
blamed the missing materials

31:28.540 --> 31:30.531
on other employees, who were terminated.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.615
And five of the hospitals,

31:32.620 --> 31:34.702
their inventory logs
were hacked and altered

31:34.710 --> 31:36.746
to disguise the missing irradiated stuff.

31:36.750 --> 31:39.571
This was a long,
thought-out intricate plan.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.747
Why murder five people
just to kill one husband?

31:42.750 --> 31:44.570
Why not get a divorce?

31:44.580 --> 31:45.990
Well, $5 million.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.707
She took out a life insurance policy
on her husband six years ago.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.376
So it's all about the money.

31:50.380 --> 31:53.747
That, and the fact that she was willing
to murder several innocent people

31:53.750 --> 31:54.956
in order to kill one.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.746
Lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse

31:56.750 --> 31:58.490
indicates anti-social
personality disorder.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.615
So where is she?

32:00.620 --> 32:03.453
If _she wants to collect
on his life insurance policy,

32:03.460 --> 32:04.825
she can't be in the wind.

32:04.830 --> 32:08.322
Yeah, pretty soon she's gonna have to play
the role of shell-shocked grieving wife.

32:08.330 --> 32:09.877
But she doesn't know we're on to her.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.877
Yeah, and when we spoke to McLean,
he hadn't called her yet.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.166
And he's been in a medically induced
coma since then,

32:15.170 --> 32:17.491
which would give her time
to hit another victim.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.569
That makes sense.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.457
Yeah, and I mean she's
not gonna want her husband

32:20.460 --> 32:21.870
as her last victim.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.745
That would bring too much scrutiny to her.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.377
She's gonna hit again.

32:25.380 --> 32:28.031
Okay, we'll get her photo
out to Metro PD. and get out there.

32:50.710 --> 32:52.416
Okay, Metro's got eyes on our UnSub.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.489
She's wearing a dark-blue hoodie.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.241
I do not have eyes on her.

32:56.830 --> 32:57.819
Lewis?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.610
Neither do I.

33:04.210 --> 33:05.996
JJ?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.660
I don't see her either.

33:09.670 --> 33:10.659
Rossi.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.455
Negaﬁve.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.115
I've got her.

33:23.540 --> 33:25.280
Blue hoodie. I've got her.

33:25.290 --> 33:26.279
Yeah, so do I.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.247
Sara McLean, FBI. Show me your hands.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.785
Sara, let her go.

33:34.790 --> 33:36.246
She's got a syringe.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.490
Ahh!

33:37.500 --> 33:38.990
I don't have a clean shot. JJ?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.319
Neither do I.

33:40.330 --> 33:41.615
-Lewis?
-Negative.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.746
Rossi. Rossi.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.412
Here's some water.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.569
Thank you.

34:08.290 --> 34:10.076
You don't have to thank me, man.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.322
I'm happy to be here.

34:13.330 --> 34:15.878
Not much longer, tough guy.

34:19.380 --> 34:20.824
Are you in pain?

34:22.790 --> 34:24.246
I'm okay.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.916
You need anything?

34:30.290 --> 34:32.667
I want...

34:34.040 --> 34:36.531
VVhat

34:37.330 --> 34:38.615
It's too late.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.748
No, no. It's not too late.
What do you want?

34:42.120 --> 34:44.327
Zach.

34:44.330 --> 34:46.571
I want to see my son.

34:46.580 --> 34:49.162
Okay. I'll make it happen.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.497
But he's in Atlanta.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.240
He won't make it back.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.161
He'll make it.

34:55.580 --> 34:56.660
How?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.825
I got a jet.

35:00.170 --> 35:01.489
All right.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.957
-I'll see you guys later.
-Yeah, see you later.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.325
Zach Bower?

35:09.330 --> 35:11.207
Yeah.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.871
We're with the FBI.

35:13.620 --> 35:14.780
It's about your dad.

35:16.790 --> 35:19.167
Look, whatever it is,

35:19.170 --> 35:20.990
I'm not interested.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.706
I'm late for class.

35:22.710 --> 35:25.668
Stephen Walker sent us to come get you.

35:29.540 --> 35:32.498
You were down there because of me.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.320
Because I threw away that medicine

35:35.330 --> 35:36.740
you were trying to get me to take.

35:36.750 --> 35:39.412
Mom, I did what I did because I wanted to.

35:39.420 --> 35:41.456
You would have
run out of medicme eventually,

35:41.460 --> 35:43.325
and Scratch would have been waiting.

35:43.750 --> 35:47.072
The same thing would have happened,
it just would have taken longer.

35:47.330 --> 35:48.911
I'm so sorry.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.319
Mom, it's not your fault.

35:50.330 --> 35:53.458
I can't believe I'm losing you to this.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.035
Not like this.

35:58.540 --> 36:00.781
The Alzheimer's...

36:00.790 --> 36:03.247
I was starting to make peace with that,

36:03.250 --> 36:07.323
but this, oh, how can I leave you here?

36:07.580 --> 36:09.286
You are not losing me,

36:09.290 --> 36:11.372
and you are not leaving me here,

36:11.380 --> 36:12.824
because I'm gonna get out.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.781
The BAU will clear my name.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.667
There isn't time.

36:17.330 --> 36:20.879
Pretty soon I won't even remember
you're my son anymore.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.708
I won't remember loving you.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.286
Love isn't a memory.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.417
It's so much more than that.

36:33.710 --> 36:35.416
Remember when I was little

36:35.420 --> 36:38.321
and you first started
having schizophrenic episodes?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.378
Oh, I used to scare you.

36:40.380 --> 36:42.325
And you used to tell me that sometimes

36:42.330 --> 36:46.494
you got confused, but you never...

36:46.880 --> 36:48.780
You never stopped loving me.

36:49.210 --> 36:51.496
Because that type of love is bigger

36:51.500 --> 36:53.491
than a disease of the brain.

36:53.500 --> 36:57.243
You used to say, love is a...

36:57.250 --> 36:59.036
Love is a world of its own

36:59.040 --> 37:02.248
that lives in the heart, not in the head.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.615
I remember.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.208
You were so little,
I didn't think you would.

37:11.170 --> 37:13.377
Even if you forget, I never will.

37:17.540 --> 37:18.996
I'm so sorry.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.571
For everything.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.320
Time's up. No physical contact.

37:24.830 --> 37:26.616
I just want to hug my son.

37:26.620 --> 37:27.996
I said step back, ma'am.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.286
Nurse is on her way down.

38:59.790 --> 39:03.248
"Life can only
be understood bacloNards,

39:03.250 --> 39:06.492
"but it must be lived forwards."

39:06.500 --> 39:08.786
Soren Kierkegaard.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.663
JJ's gonna keep coming to visit you, okay?

39:20.670 --> 39:22.706
I know.

39:22.710 --> 39:24.575
And I will write to you.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.207
Ready, Diana? It's time.

39:26.540 --> 39:27.700
Don't rush me.

39:27.710 --> 39:29.166
It's time to go.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.877
Have we met?

39:36.460 --> 39:39.372
No. I'm sorry, I should
have introduced myself.

39:39.380 --> 39:40.495
Carol Atkinson.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.115
No physical contact.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.667
I know you.

39:46.620 --> 39:50.738
What you do to me will be nothing
compared to what my dad will do to you.

39:52.670 --> 39:53.910
Argh!

39:54.750 --> 39:56.240
Go on, kill him, Daddy!

39:56.250 --> 39:57.820
Put the gun down and freeze!

39:57.830 --> 39:59.161
Please help me!

39:59.170 --> 40:00.819
Listen to what she wants.
She's begging you

40:00.830 --> 40:02.240
to kill somebody right in front of her.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.450
Your life has been about violence,

40:04.460 --> 40:07.668
and if you do this,
Lindsey's will be, too.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.325
Do you want that?

40:09.330 --> 40:10.570
Kill him.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.780
You're Lindsey Vaughan.

40:17.670 --> 40:20.070
Um, no.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.412
Carol. Carol Atkinson.

40:23.540 --> 40:25.326
It's nice to meet you.

40:25.330 --> 40:27.036
Your mother's an angel.

40:27.540 --> 40:29.781
So glad you had this time together.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.377
Let's go, Diana.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.205
Time to go.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.075
Your brain
is playing tricks on you.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.411
You keep saying "her."

40:42.420 --> 40:46.072
Because it wasn't
Scratch who framed me.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.240
It was a woman.

40:47.250 --> 40:48.410
Time to go.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.160
Time... Time to...

40:52.620 --> 40:54.747
- -Guard! Guard!

40:54.750 --> 40:56.377
Mom! Mom!
