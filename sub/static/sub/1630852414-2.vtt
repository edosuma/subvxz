WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.590
Come on, Mariana.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.676
Pick one.

00:10.927 --> 00:16.057
Pablo, neither is leakproof
or ultra-absorbent.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.644
Do you want Regina to get a rash?

00:19.728 --> 00:21.855
No, but this is all we can afford.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.898
These diapers look so sad.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.901
Check these out instead.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.113
Regina's little butt is used to these.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.158
Mariana, we no longer have
Ana's resources.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.828
Who wants it anyway?
She tried to buy Regina from us.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.123
I have a job interview later,
and I'm sure I'll do great.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.167
Until then, we have to stay within budget.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.170
I don't think saving money on diapers
is the best idea.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.923
What? I thought it was
cloth diapers all the way.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.802
They have biodegradable diapers
that are good for the planet.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.637
But bad for our wallet. Look at the price.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.062
You have to pay for those.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.900
Okay. We'll take these.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.322
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:11.965 --> 02:14.300
I gave you half an hour.
It's been 25 minutes.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.677
Hurry up.

02:15.760 --> 02:20.181
I can't believe my brother saved
his wedding bow tie.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.016
Me neither. It doesn't fit anymore.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.227
I was there when he bought it.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.895
He said, "Víctor,

02:26.479 --> 02:29.649
this thing with Ana
is going to last forever."

02:29.732 --> 02:34.445
If you're trying to tug my heartstrings,
hoping I'll forgive him, forget it.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.197
Ana, I think you're exaggerating.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.325
You've been married 20 years.
Some mistakes can be forgiven.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.328
Did you put a gun to his head
and force him to sleep with Tere?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.455
-Don't coddle him, Víctor.
-I'm not.

02:44.539 --> 02:48.418
But we must admit my brother is clumsy,
even when it comes to cheating.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.714
His mistress turned out to be
the grandmother of his supposed daughter.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.257
It's pretty funny.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.677
-You don't find it funny?
-No, I don't.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.971
Hurry up. I have a busy day.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.223
Look, we all make mistakes.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.350
You're not without fault here.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.355
-Get out of my house.
-I still need his silk ties.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.774
-Forget about the ties. I want you gone.
-Okay.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.944
Juan Carlos wants you
to tell the kids to answer his calls.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.738
He wants to see them this weekend.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.698
I'll talk to them.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.702
-And tell him to buy new ties.
-Okay, but why take it out on me?

03:31.127 --> 03:32.587
<i>Hi, Mariana.</i>

03:32.670 --> 03:35.048
Ana told me you went to her house.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.091
To tell her none of it was your fault.

03:37.175 --> 03:41.054
You also told her I couldn't handle it,
so she offered to buy Regina from me.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.681
-What? That woman is crazy.
<i>-Exactly!</i>

03:43.765 --> 03:46.351
Now I can't see Valentina, Mom.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.019
I was only trying to help.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.271
Stop worrying about me, okay?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.606
I can handle it myself.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.523
<i>Listen, Mariana.</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:55.109
There are no superwomen, get it?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.238
We all need a support network
to get ahead.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.907
That's why I have Pablo and Elena.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.076
So, please, give me my space.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.035
<i>Bye.</i>

04:04.619 --> 04:05.745
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

04:05.828 --> 04:07.956
Ana wants nothing to do with you.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.332
Where are my silk ties?

04:09.415 --> 04:11.084
She said you should buy new ones.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.171
Oh, and she got mad
when I said she wasn't without fault.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.673
Why would you tell her that?

04:16.756 --> 04:19.175
Now she won't let my kids come over.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.137
She said she'd pass along the message,
so you better tidy up around here.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.642
Crap. It's Tere.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.895
Answer it. Ana isn't here to listen in.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.942
-Hi, Tere.
<i>-How are you, Juan Carlos?</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:40.905
I just wanted to let you know
I'll be paying you back tomorrow.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.657
Sorry it took this long.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.618
I was broke after restocking my products.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.536
Don't worry.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.079
<i>You must be mad about</i>

04:48.162 --> 04:49.497
what happened at the baptism,

04:49.580 --> 04:53.042
but I assure you
I didn't tell Ana anything.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.669
It wasn't my fault.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.337
I'd rather not talk about it.

04:56.421 --> 05:00.717
Did you know
Ana kicked out Mariana and Regina?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.886
I know, Tere,
but I'd rather not talk about any of that.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.015
Okay, I just called
to make sure you knew all this.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.600
That's it. Thank you. Goodbye.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.396
I need a favor.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.317
Yummy apples, sweetheart.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.860
Isn't that a choking hazard?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.988
-What about her baby food?
-I won't puree her food.

05:22.071 --> 05:26.617
It's a new thing called
"complementary self-regulated nutrition."

05:26.701 --> 05:28.536
I put it on the app, actually.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.788
I can't wait to launch it.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.124
Hi, Penguin. What's up?

05:33.207 --> 05:35.043
My interview was rescheduled.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.046
They want to see me in one hour.
Can you watch Regina?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.047
Sorry, I can't.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.383
I'm tutoring a guy
who has a calculus exam tomorrow.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.635
If I don't go, they'll fire me.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.637
We can't afford that right now.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.847
You're right.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.892
You should ask your mom or your grandma.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.313
What do you think?

05:56.147 --> 05:59.442
You have to take his calls.
He's your father.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.445
He could send texts like normal people.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.697
Even if he texts, I don't wanna see him.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.200
Listen, kids, he's your father.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.202
You just have to deal with it.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.746
He'll always be your father,
so get used to it.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.416
Find out his new address,
and ask Ramón to drive you.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.460
Why don't you come with us?

06:17.543 --> 06:21.005
I have to go to the office.
Well, my former office.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.635
-You're going back to work?
-No, I'm officially resigning.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.597
Mom, are you
seriously never working again?

06:30.723 --> 06:33.059
So did you graduate from university?

06:33.142 --> 06:36.437
Yeah, pretty much.
I just need a few more credits.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.816
This is an accounting assistant position.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.776
-Yeah, that's perfect.
-Okay.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.778
Do you have access to daycare?

06:44.278 --> 06:45.780
This is a full-time position.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.782
That won't be a problem.

06:47.865 --> 06:51.119
I see here that you worked
as a receptionist in a beauty salon,

06:51.619 --> 06:54.539
and you have a lot of experience
working with apps.

06:54.622 --> 06:59.001
I drew up the business plan
for a maternity app

06:59.085 --> 07:01.212
that we're about to launch.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.798
I'm so sorry.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.467
That was a gift from my mom.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.512
I'm sure we can glue it
back together, and--

07:10.096 --> 07:11.347
Leave it. It's fine.

07:11.431 --> 07:16.102
Let me tell you some more
about the app we're launching.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.479
In fact, I was able
to secure an investor that…

07:23.443 --> 07:27.572
We're currently working
on a launch plan, and--

07:27.655 --> 07:28.489
Sorry.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.325
-Shouldn't you--
-Yes, I'll go change her.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.243
Yes, please do.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.289
<i>It's not what we expected,</i>

07:36.372 --> 07:38.332
but we're not in dire straits.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.752
I need this place to turn a profit
so I can help Mariana out.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.964
Enough! Stop worrying about your daughter.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.925
She doesn't appreciate
what you do for her.

07:48.009 --> 07:52.221
I don't care. I'm her mother,
and I don't need her gratitude.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.516
-Carlos said--
-Hello, how's it going?

07:56.142 --> 07:56.976
Hi.

07:57.059 --> 08:01.147
I know I'm not your favorite person,
but I have a message from Juan Carlos.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.984
-I'll go to the storeroom.
-Okay, tell me.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.862
What does your brother want?
I'll pay him tomorrow.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.364
-The debt is settled.
-Listen up, Víctor.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.117
-Why do you always insult me?
-What did I do now?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.953
It's a matter of dignity for me
to repay your brother.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.415
A debt that isn't repaid
follows you forever,

08:19.499 --> 08:21.542
and neither of us wants that.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.503
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.545
Thanks.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.631
You know what? You're right.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.926
Why don't you pay me, and I'll pay him?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.803
That way, you won't have to see
Juan Carlos ever again.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.265
Deal.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.768
I have one more favor to ask.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.562
Forget what happened between us.
That wasn't me.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.315
In fact, if I ever insulted you,
I apologize.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.525
I mean it.

08:47.109 --> 08:50.738
-Let me be clear. I'll pay you back soon.
-Of course.

08:50.821 --> 08:54.992
These new products will be a hit,
and I'll be able to pay you back.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.869
-Don't worry.
-Do you have time?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.204
You can try them out.

08:58.287 --> 09:02.708
I don't like facials or lotions.
Especially not in a ladies' salon.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.794
-Oh, please!
-Never mind that.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.422
-Seriously, there's no need.
-It's our way of saying thanks.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.341
Your face will be soft as a baby's.

09:11.342 --> 09:15.263
I told them
these diapers aren't leakproof.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.808
Remind me to give these
a bad review on my app, Regis.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.977
I spent four years abroad.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.603
I'm back.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.523
Don't worry. We were done.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.733
But you said I should come back.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.819
No need. Thanks. We'll call you.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.950
Finding a job will be
a lot harder than I thought.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.869
Don't worry.
I got an interview for an IT job.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.247
Cynthia recommended me.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.916
I thought you guys broke up.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.421
We're trying to remain friends, yeah.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.338
You know?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.883
I should ask Conrado
to let me borrow one of his suits.

09:52.967 --> 09:53.801
All right.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.600
I know it's going to be awkward,
but suck it up. He's your dad.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.644
-Did you give Ramón the address?
<i>-Yes.</i>

10:03.728 --> 10:06.355
I didn't see the point
in sending it to you.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.773
<i>Don't fret, sweetie.</i>

10:08.441 --> 10:10.901
Trust me, there are worse things in life.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.575
Ana?

10:27.084 --> 10:28.669
Ana, you're back.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.504
I guess you missed us.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.507
Very much. Especially you, Manuel.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.009
Your name is Manuel, right?

10:35.092 --> 10:38.429
I'm glad you're in a good mood,
especially after the--

10:38.512 --> 10:40.973
Yes, I'm in a great mood

10:41.057 --> 10:43.225
because, lucky for you,
I'm here to resign,

10:43.309 --> 10:44.602
which you'll be happy about.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.898
I'm glad. I thought I'd have
to cancel the tournament.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.234
What tournament?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.153
Just work stuff.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.824
Ever since you left,
things have changed a lot here.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.826
Morning, darling. How are you?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.704
I would explain,
but you no longer work here.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.957
What's up, George?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.335
-Good morning.
-Hi, Ana. Good to see you.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.546
Could you stop by my office
before heading to HR?

11:13.464 --> 11:17.677
Why? You can't stand Manolo
and want me to come back?

11:26.185 --> 11:27.269
-You're spot on.
-Yes.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.816
Bitch.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.442
<i>She wasn't glad to see me.</i>

11:34.735 --> 11:38.030
But later, when I told her
you'd forgive the loan,

11:38.114 --> 11:39.115
her attitude changed.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.450
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.496
-It's weird she accepted so easily.
-She doesn't want to see you again.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.541
That's what you wanted, right?

11:48.624 --> 11:50.918
I mean, sure, yeah.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.754
-Vic, how are you?
-Hey, man.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.466
-What's up?
-Dude, you look ten years younger.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.467
Tell me.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.220
-What's your secret?
-I noticed it too.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.638
What did you do?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.015
<i>You look wonderful.</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:06.559
How is your health?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.729
Fortunately, the cancer scare
was a false alarm,

12:10.312 --> 12:13.107
but it made me reevaluate my entire life.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.943
But that's not why we're here, is it?

12:16.444 --> 12:17.278
Tell me.

12:18.779 --> 12:22.032
We were invited to the International
Women in Business Conference.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.536
And without women in top roles,
you're going to look bad.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.246
They invited us because of you.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.249
Thanks, but no, thanks.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.087
The company didn't support me before,
so I don't owe you any favors.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.883
Ana, I know you're right.
I should've been there for you.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.384
Too late.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.636
Well,

12:43.596 --> 12:44.513
what a shame.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.933
I'll have to bring Manolo.
He's begging me to take him.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.519
Manolo! Jeez!

12:51.145 --> 12:55.107
He's such a misogynist. He'll cause
a scandal instead of networking.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.735
So long.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.405
<i>Don't look at me that way.</i>

13:01.489 --> 13:03.157
This is a great plan.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.117
I'll be my own boss,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.077
work flexible hours.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.956
My income will be based
on how many hours I work,

13:11.040 --> 13:15.002
and I'll ride my bike all over the city,
which will expand my social circle.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.462
Check it out.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.131
I got a baby seat
in case I need to bring Regis.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.342
You're not great with bicycles.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.803
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-What?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.721
I was practically born on wheels.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.308
Besides, it's only temporary
while I find a stable job

13:29.391 --> 13:31.310
and get Regina into daycare.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.523
I think this is the best plan
you've ever had.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.900
You can count on me. I support you.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.903
I should get going.
I need to get dressed for my interview.

13:40.986 --> 13:45.241
Wait. I'm happy about your interview,
but you said you'd watch Regina.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.245
Sorry. I forgot to tell you
they rescheduled.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.747
Good thing you have
flexible working hours.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.875
Right, but my income is tied
to how many hours I put in.

13:55.793 --> 13:59.630
And you have class later today,
which means I'll make zero pesos.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.968
Hey, I'm not busy today.
I can watch Regina.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.724
You go to your interview,
and you go expand your social circle.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.560
-Are you sure?
-Seriously?

14:13.185 --> 14:16.939
Sure. How hard can it be
to watch a sleeping baby?

14:19.316 --> 14:21.861
I'll change my mind on the count of three.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.028
-One.
-Bye!

14:24.238 --> 14:26.574
Two, two and a half…

14:30.202 --> 14:31.704
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

14:31.787 --> 14:33.706
I forgave you for the pictures.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.584
Tell me, how are things
with your new boss?

14:36.667 --> 14:40.754
Well, nothing has changed.
Everything remains the same.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.257
What about my office? Did they change it?

14:43.340 --> 14:46.093
Let me take a look
to see what they've done.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.597
How about a coffee? They switched brands.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.891
It's much better than it used to be.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.475
-That's great.
-Yeah.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.436
-All right.
-Who's stupid now? Try me!

14:56.437 --> 14:59.064
Hell yeah! In your face!

14:59.148 --> 15:01.317
In your face, man! Give me my coffee.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.985
Ana!

15:04.320 --> 15:07.197
Sorry for not inviting you,
but this is a guys' thing.

15:07.281 --> 15:11.577
No wonder Jorge is looking for someone
to take to the Women's Conference.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
If you'll excuse me.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.040
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

15:16.707 --> 15:19.460
You have a booger.
What do you want me to do?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.505
Where's the pacifier? Here's the pacifier!

15:24.089 --> 15:26.425
<i>Hey, mama! Baby, I want you</i>

15:26.508 --> 15:29.428
<i>Grabbing my bedposts</i>
<i>That's how I see you</i>

15:35.017 --> 15:36.727
Coming!

15:38.187 --> 15:40.356
<i>Your call will be transferred</i>
<i>to voice mail.</i>

15:45.611 --> 15:47.237
<i>Your call will be transferred--</i>

15:47.321 --> 15:49.907
Your grandma
probably knows what to do, right?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.788
-How good are you at foosball?
-Pretty good, I guess.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.461
It says here you designed a maternity app.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.381
-That kind of crap is trending, huh?
-Yeah.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.801
Besides, I have a baby,
who is my biggest inspiration.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.637
Isn't she beautiful?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.599
Actually, Ana knows her well.
She's like her second mother.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.607
I don't think
you're qualified for the job.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.068
I can design, program,
and implement software

16:26.819 --> 16:28.112
in all kinds of systems.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.238
It's my specialty.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.281
We'll be in touch. Don't call us.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.994
-I'm great at foosball!
-Thanks!

16:35.786 --> 16:37.371
<i>Everything is doubled.</i>

16:37.454 --> 16:41.166
Parents often mellow out
to keep the kids happy.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.128
The best part about the separation
is doing what we want.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.421
You'll love my plan.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.172
Make the most of it.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.554
<i>Your call will be transferred</i>
<i>to voice mail.</i>

16:54.972 --> 16:56.348
I don't know anyone.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.475
It's Olivia's cousin's party.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.060
You'll have a great time.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.273
I'm so glad you were able to escape.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.984
We have the house to ourselves.
No adult supervision.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.820
-I'll introduce you to my cousin.
-I'm so nervous.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.869
Mariana will laugh so much
when I tell her I failed as a nanny.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.203
You can't tell her I was here.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.997
Please don't.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.583
She clearly told me
to stay out of her life.

17:23.250 --> 17:28.505
In fact, I'll get this done quickly
so I can leave before we get caught.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.340
Isn't that right?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.427
There are no more diapers here.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.262
-Can you get me some more?
-Yeah.

17:35.345 --> 17:39.516
Elena, thank you so much
for everything you do for my daughter.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.602
Thanks for rescuing me.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.644
At your service.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.943
Who's your cousin?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.153
Darío Lunatti.

17:51.695 --> 17:55.074
He's a super famous streamer.
He's right there. Come on.

17:55.657 --> 17:56.867
Take that!

17:59.495 --> 18:00.913
It's the guy from the café.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.415
He has 10,000 viewers on Twitch.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.710
Shut up, okay?
I didn't even give him my number.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.047
-So you're Ceci.
-Yeah.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.673
Sorry about the other day.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.008
No worries.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.136
You still owe me a pastry.
I haven't forgotten.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.305
Wanna dance?

18:33.487 --> 18:34.488
<i>It was a disaster.</i>

18:34.988 --> 18:37.116
The guy who interviewed me is such a snob.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.077
Maybe there's something I can do,

18:40.160 --> 18:42.996
like cancel
the other candidates' appointments.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.875
Being the assistant, I have all the power.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.129
Pablo, what are you doing here?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.799
I interviewed for a job.
It didn't go well.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.008
Manolo interviewed him.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.262
Telling him I'm Regis's dad didn't help.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.889
It was supposed to help me
with Regina's expenses.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.516
Oh well.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.937
I think I can help you with that.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.439
-Seriously?
-Yeah<i>.</i>

19:10.315 --> 19:12.025
Consider the job yours.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.780
But in exchange,
you have to do something for me.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.827
Hi, we're Víctor's friends.

19:21.910 --> 19:26.373
We were wondering if we could get
the same treatment as him.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.083
Of course. My pleasure.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.002
Do you cater to men here?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.004
Of course we do.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.797
Make yourselves at home.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.341
-We'll be right with you.
-This way, please.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.759
Yes!

19:39.219 --> 19:40.512
I want you to meet someone.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.310
DAD

19:50.147 --> 19:53.817
I need to know when you'll be here
so I can put the lasagna in the oven.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.736
You'd better answer.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.363
You'll have to see me anyway.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.032
<i>What's up, George? You called?</i>

20:00.115 --> 20:02.326
Yes, we're hiring Pablo.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.537
Cynthia, get him a contract.
Here's his résumé.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.124
Give Ana the information
about the conference.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.375
She's coming with me.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.044
But Ana doesn't even--

20:12.127 --> 20:13.045
Thank you.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.725
What happened? Is everything all right?

20:26.808 --> 20:29.645
-I have 20 missed calls from you.
-Everything's fine.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.023
I got a call

20:33.815 --> 20:35.484
about a last-minute gig.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.862
I have to rush to rehearsal.
Sorry, I can't watch Regina.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.239
Are you serious?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.825
I have a delivery nearby.
I'll be right back.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.161
Sorry, I'm late as it is.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.246
Well, bye!

20:49.581 --> 20:50.624
Okay.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.254
Okay, I guess
you're coming with me, Regis.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.570
Hey!

21:20.654 --> 21:22.531
That's so irresponsible!

21:37.838 --> 21:39.965
Don't want any? Are you done?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.441
-Here's your gift bag.
-Thanks.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.027
Thank you for your visit.
You look handsome!

22:00.110 --> 22:01.737
-Come back soon.
-Thanks.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.654
Bye!

22:05.532 --> 22:06.825
This is great!

22:06.908 --> 22:09.745
You know what? I have an idea.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.621
Incredible, wait.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.467
Did you eat the cake, sweetie?

22:23.967 --> 22:25.260
Finally!

22:26.428 --> 22:29.806
Jeez! Not only are you late,
but the cake is also ruined!

22:29.890 --> 22:31.808
I'm sorry. I'll get you another one.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.435
Never mind.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.107
Oh, sweetie.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.443
Ramón, hi.
Ceci and Rodrigo aren't answering.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.945
When are you planning
on bringing them over?

22:45.822 --> 22:46.656
What?

22:46.740 --> 22:50.160
Ramón, Ceci never let me know
they made it to Juan Carlos's place.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.620
They're not picking up.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.623
What?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.296
Nice of you to show up.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.672
I've been calling you.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.801
You didn't think to call me
when the kids didn't show up?

23:05.884 --> 23:08.387
Why would I? It's not like you'd pick up.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.974
Arguing out here won't help anyone.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.106
Hey!

23:20.440 --> 23:22.818
Are there no adults here?

23:22.901 --> 23:23.902
It seems that way.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.406
You go that way, and I'll go this way.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.448
Okay.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.044
Cecilia!

23:42.087 --> 23:43.797
-It's your dad!
-I'm sorry.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.596
-Why are you here?
-No, what are <i>you </i>doing here?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.056
You were to go to my place.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.058
Mom said I could come.

23:55.642 --> 23:56.852
That's not true!

23:56.935 --> 23:59.271
You tricked Ramón into driving you here.

23:59.771 --> 24:03.817
It's not fair we have to do everything
you say just because you're separated.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.736
At least answer the phone!
Where is your brother?

24:09.448 --> 24:10.282
Over there.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.749
<i>"She's really irresponsible."</i>

24:20.750 --> 24:22.794
"She's the worst delivery girl ever."

24:23.795 --> 24:26.548
In Regina's defense,
this cake is delicious.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.091
It was a total mess,

24:28.675 --> 24:30.552
and I have to pay for the cake.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.846
-Doesn't matter.
-What do you mean?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.015
Did we win the lottery?

24:35.765 --> 24:36.683
I got the job.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.394
It's the same company Cynthia works for.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.521
-Dude, are you serious?
-Yep.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.357
This is such great news!

24:45.192 --> 24:47.152
I always knew you'd get the job.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.487
I'm happy for you.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.780
You can quit the delivery gig.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.199
Thanks, Pablo,

24:53.283 --> 24:57.287
but I want to keep working,
despite being the worst delivery girl.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.665
I never want to be a charity case again.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.083
Just promise me one thing.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.711
Find a job where you can grow.

25:05.795 --> 25:06.838
I promise.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.933
I wish you would've told me
you didn't want to come over.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.978
-I'm grounded, aren't I?
-No.

25:22.062 --> 25:26.858
I hope the hangover will be enough
to keep you away from alcohol for a while.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.776
Hopefully.

25:27.859 --> 25:31.029
-You're a dork who can't hold his booze.
-It's not his fault.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.281
Your lies put your brother at risk.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.992
You need to own up to your mistakes.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.827
You didn't own up to yours, Dad.

25:37.911 --> 25:38.787
Cecilia!

25:39.371 --> 25:41.748
-Respect your dad.
-You're right, Cecilia.

25:41.831 --> 25:45.335
We should all own up to our mistakes.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.379
That's what I'm trying to do.

25:50.757 --> 25:53.802
All I care about
is getting my family back.

25:57.430 --> 26:00.225
It's hard watching your parents
go through a separation.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.858
They need time.

26:10.443 --> 26:11.403
We all do.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.700
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

26:24.791 --> 26:28.044
Women get beauty treatments all the time.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.338
We have no problem
telling people about it.

26:30.422 --> 26:36.011
Meanwhile, men claim that shaving
is all they ever do to their faces.

26:36.094 --> 26:39.264
That's wrong
because men like looking good.

26:39.848 --> 26:40.890
We introduce to you

26:41.558 --> 26:43.768
the first spa and beauty salon for men.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.604
A one-stop shop.

26:45.687 --> 26:50.150
A concept that truly understands
the needs of the modern man.

26:50.817 --> 26:51.860
What do you think?

26:53.903 --> 26:54.738
It's…

26:57.032 --> 26:58.408
a great idea.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.161
We're actually looking for investors.

27:01.244 --> 27:04.372
Since you took over my debt,

27:04.456 --> 27:06.249
I thought you'd be interested.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.294
So, in broad strokes, this is my idea.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.755
Sounds great.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.467
I might even turn out to be
one of those repressed, vain men.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.928
You'll see, with us,
you're in great hands.

27:19.012 --> 27:23.642
No one knows
beauty and men better than us.

27:24.851 --> 27:25.769
Okay.

27:27.896 --> 27:28.980
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

27:29.064 --> 27:30.732
Oh, Regis.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.818
Good thing I can see you
more often now, baby.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.488
Ana, thanks for the job.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.989
This makes it worth it.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.951
You're too skinny, sweetie.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.703
Aren't they feeding you?

27:43.787 --> 27:44.746
On the contrary.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.539
She's eating solids now.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.751
It's called "complementary
self-regulated nutrition."

27:50.377 --> 27:52.462
You have a crazy mom, sweetheart.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.258
I'll send you some liver puree with Ramón.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.804
No, Ana, Mariana and I
can take care of her.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.517
She told me you tried to buy her.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.394
Oh, never mind all that.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.814
I'm just glad I can see her more often.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.484
Look, I got her some cute dresses.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.319
They're hypoallergenic cotton.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.988
Can you tell me
what the hell you're doing here?

28:19.489 --> 28:21.866
Why are you here?
You're supposed to be working.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.120
You're working as a delivery person?

28:25.662 --> 28:28.790
This job allows me to work
around Regina's schedule.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.583
Sure, I guess.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.295
I don't have a full-time nanny
or a husband like you.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.339
Your support network is huge.

28:37.424 --> 28:41.094
Mine is a network composed
of nothing but traitors, right?

28:44.389 --> 28:45.306
Mariana!

28:47.809 --> 28:51.312
Ana helped me get the job
in exchange for letting her see Regina.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.275
I can't believe you let Ana bribe you
after what she did to me.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.193
What else could I do, Mariana?

28:57.277 --> 29:00.572
I'm sick of not being able
to provide for you and Regina.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.450
-I didn't ask you to provide.
-Easy for you to say.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.536
No one is looking at you
like some kind of loser.

29:07.537 --> 29:10.039
It's hard being a guy
who can't support his family.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.416
Pablo has a point.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.211
What? You're taking the traitor's side?

29:15.295 --> 29:19.966
No, Mariana, but we must admit
daycare would make our lives easier.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.176
Daycare costs money.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.594
But we don't need it!

29:23.178 --> 29:26.055
We can keep taking turns
looking after Regina.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.932
I couldn't look after Regina.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.726
I couldn't even change her diaper.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.603
I lied to you. There was no gig.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.147
I lied because
I didn't want to babysit her.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.316
I called your mom. She came to help me.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.319
What the hell?
Why didn't you tell me, Elena?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.282
Seriously, you're a couple
of bold-faced liars.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.242
Mariana, you can't leave.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.953
What else can I do, Pablo?
I can't trust you anymore.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.956
Honestly, this--

29:52.582 --> 29:56.002
I don't know.
It feels like living with the enemy.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.257
Mariana!

30:06.679 --> 30:08.640
There are no superwomen.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.392
And if there are,
I have nothing but respect for them.

30:13.436 --> 30:16.689
Mom, I'm sorry. I was awful to you.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.526
I finally realized

30:19.609 --> 30:22.028
one does whatever it takes
for one's children.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.446
Right, sweetie?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.657
Like apologizing to one's mom.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.534
What happened?

30:27.617 --> 30:31.788
I thought things were wonderful
with Pablo and Elena.

30:31.871 --> 30:35.667
It turns out my support network
was full of good intentions,

30:35.750 --> 30:38.294
but they lack experience and wisdom.

30:40.421 --> 30:45.301
I came to ask if you're willing
to be part of that network.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.516
I'm not sure. What do you think?

30:52.809 --> 30:55.645
I'm not sure either.
I'm so busy with work.

30:55.728 --> 30:59.732
-Hey, please!
-I can't multitask.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.192
Hey! I need you!

31:08.116 --> 31:09.868
Of course we'll help you.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.953
We'll always be there for you.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.206
-Come here.
-Oh, Mom!

31:15.957 --> 31:16.833
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

31:17.500 --> 31:19.043
I would've died without you.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.378
See you next weekend.

31:22.130 --> 31:22.964
Hey!

31:23.047 --> 31:24.299
Say goodbye to your dad.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.802
Bye.

31:30.346 --> 31:31.514
She's still mad at me.

31:32.974 --> 31:36.477
I owe you an apology
for the poor communication between us.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.354
We're family.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.566
You're a major part of my support network.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.861
The part I trust the most.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.530
Can we go back to couples counseling?

31:49.699 --> 31:50.783
Your silk ties.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.798
I'm sorry about what I did with Ana.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.885
I shouldn't have gone behind your back,

32:08.968 --> 32:13.932
but I should be able to decide
what's best for her sometimes.

32:14.557 --> 32:18.436
I don't want you to think
you're living with the enemy.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.355
Pablo…

32:22.148 --> 32:23.858
you're not my enemy.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.526
I know. Ana is your enemy.

32:26.527 --> 32:30.323
You're both trying to get us
to take sides in this war, but I can't.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.576
I need some distance, Mariana.

32:34.869 --> 32:35.995
Distance from you.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.546
I'll pick up Regina tomorrow.

32:53.012 --> 32:53.930
Hey.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.265
Pablo…

34:10.715 --> 34:15.928
