00:00.321 --> 00:02.522
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.523 --> 00:04.223
You want juice or are you
a milk person?

00:04.291 --> 00:05.692
Know what I'd really like?

00:05.759 --> 00:07.694
Oh, I do indeed,
but falling off the wagon...

00:07.761 --> 00:08.828
May not be the best option.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.496
Haven't seen you
around before.

00:10.564 --> 00:11.764
Are you new?

00:11.832 --> 00:13.132
Eight years, actually.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.068
Just--just a minute.

00:15.135 --> 00:16.469
What is this?

00:16.537 --> 00:19.338
Sometimes he forgets we answer
to a higher authority.

00:19.406 --> 00:23.242
What higher authori--

00:23.310 --> 00:26.312
the Regents.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.513
These are the Regents?

00:27.581 --> 00:29.382
This waitress is a Regent?

00:29.450 --> 00:32.317
Who would you have control
the Warehouse?

00:32.386 --> 00:33.686
Kings?

00:33.754 --> 00:35.188
Popes?

00:35.255 --> 00:36.989
Politicians?

00:37.057 --> 00:38.491
Be nothing left of it.

00:38.559 --> 00:41.194
Mr. Valda, you tell me
right to my face.

00:41.261 --> 00:44.197
Either fire me or kill me...

00:44.264 --> 00:45.565
Or let me do my job.

00:55.676 --> 00:57.977
A missing walking stick?

00:58.045 --> 01:02.815
A stick that causes earthquakes?

01:02.883 --> 01:04.316
Say it.

01:04.384 --> 01:05.651
It doesn't mean
that this is it.

01:05.719 --> 01:11.023
Oh, it kills you that
I figured out one first.

01:11.091 --> 01:12.592
Just because
the robberies involved...

01:12.659 --> 01:13.960
Earthquakes.

01:14.027 --> 01:15.762
What some people reported
as earthquakes...

01:15.829 --> 01:17.163
Ah!

01:17.231 --> 01:18.564
And there happens
to be a piece missing

01:18.632 --> 01:20.566
from a nearby exhibit
about an earthquake...

01:20.634 --> 01:22.802
The largest one ever felt
in England,

01:22.870 --> 01:26.139
a country not known for its
earthquakes, by the way.

01:26.206 --> 01:30.276
It doesn't mean that
this is the artifact.

01:30.344 --> 01:33.079
Chin up, Watson, old Bean.

01:33.147 --> 01:37.717
We can't all be as brilliant
as Sherlock Lattimer.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.087
Ahem.

01:41.155 --> 01:42.889
Hey, Pete?
Yes?

01:42.956 --> 01:45.625
The case is intact
and the lock's not picked.

01:45.692 --> 01:47.460
So what, inside job?

01:47.528 --> 01:48.828
Peruse their payroll?

01:48.896 --> 01:52.565
After you.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.634
Ooh.

01:54.701 --> 01:56.068
Victory lap.

01:56.136 --> 01:58.271
Will you get over yourself?

01:58.338 --> 02:01.574
What's that you say?

02:01.642 --> 02:03.509
Grow up.

02:03.577 --> 02:05.912
Ahh.
Ooh, ooh!

02:10.951 --> 02:12.151
News flash!
Stop.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.419
Bering to admit she was wrong.
Stop.

02:13.487 --> 02:15.421
Pigs standing by
for maiden flight.

02:15.489 --> 02:17.757
Stop!

02:17.825 --> 02:21.394
You do see the "do not touch"
signs everywhere?

02:23.730 --> 02:26.165
New favorite job perk:

02:26.233 --> 02:28.534
Officially allowed
to ignore velvet ropes.

02:28.602 --> 02:30.203
I'm on this side.
I'm on this side.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.405
I'm on this side.

02:47.888 --> 02:50.056
Hey, Pete.
Yeah?

02:50.123 --> 02:51.591
The sign for the stick
was still there.

02:51.658 --> 02:53.159
Okay?

02:53.227 --> 02:55.228
Well, the museum hasn't
reported a theft.

02:55.295 --> 02:57.697
They haven't noticed it's gone.

02:57.764 --> 02:58.965
He puts it back.

02:59.032 --> 03:02.168
When he's not using it.

03:13.146 --> 03:16.315
Whoa!

03:16.383 --> 03:17.516
Oh!
Myka, look out!

03:17.584 --> 03:20.119
Ah!

03:20.187 --> 03:21.420
You okay?
Yeah.

03:21.488 --> 03:22.388
Okay.
Okay.

03:24.258 --> 03:27.093
That way?
I'm on it.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.361
Secret Service.

03:28.428 --> 03:29.629
One of your security guards
is getting away

03:29.696 --> 03:30.630
with a stolen--
you, hold it!

03:30.697 --> 03:32.531
I don't have time for this.

03:39.439 --> 03:40.573
Mrs. Frederic?

03:40.641 --> 03:41.841
It's no time to explain.

03:41.909 --> 03:43.542
This is of the utmost secrecy.

03:43.610 --> 03:45.845
You cannot tell Arthur
or even Agent Bering.

03:45.913 --> 03:47.046
Okay.

03:47.114 --> 03:48.447
I want you
to throw this mission

03:48.515 --> 03:52.184
and let the artifact get away.

03:52.252 --> 03:55.922
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:55.989 --> 03:57.990
Mrs. Frederic,
what is going on?

03:58.058 --> 03:59.892
That's an order,
Mr. Lattimer.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.160
I'll contact you later.

04:01.228 --> 04:04.563
Go!

04:04.631 --> 04:07.366
Pete!

04:07.434 --> 04:08.534
Pete, where's the guy?

04:08.602 --> 04:12.238
I don't know.

04:12.306 --> 04:15.174
I lost him.

04:15.242 --> 04:19.745
I thought he was out here,
but he's gone.

04:19.813 --> 04:21.747
Guess you can spare some time
for us now.

05:05.034 --> 05:07.836
Yeah, they're Secret Service.

05:07.904 --> 05:09.738
We're not gonna press charges.

05:09.806 --> 05:11.673
I thought fishing you
out of custody

05:11.741 --> 05:13.408
would be like old times,
Lattimer,

05:13.476 --> 05:15.611
but you and your friend are
both fully clothed.

05:15.678 --> 05:17.513
They catch you too early
or too late?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.515
Well, I've matured since then.

05:19.582 --> 05:21.350
I get arrested in my pants
all the time now.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.486
I'm guessing you two have met?

05:24.554 --> 05:26.188
Kate Logan,
Chicago field office.

05:26.256 --> 05:28.690
The cops called us
to check out your story.

05:28.758 --> 05:31.560
And you heard my name and
wanted to see me.

05:31.628 --> 05:33.128
You know, I could just
vouch for you

05:33.196 --> 05:35.230
and we could leave him
at the early man exhibit.

05:35.298 --> 05:36.532
Awesome.
I like her.

05:36.599 --> 05:37.866
Hmm.

05:37.934 --> 05:40.402
That's a good one.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.738
I didn't know you transferred
to Chicago.

05:42.805 --> 05:44.106
I didn't know
you transferred

05:44.173 --> 05:45.641
to super-secret South Dakota.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.876
Is that a promotion
or a punishment?

05:47.944 --> 05:49.878
Yeah, well,
it depends on the day.

05:49.946 --> 05:52.147
So far, today's good.

05:52.215 --> 05:54.583
Anyway, I got to get back
to my case.

05:54.651 --> 05:57.119
Ahh, yeah,
a stolen walking stick.

05:57.186 --> 05:58.487
Defcon Four.

05:58.555 --> 06:00.055
Well, it's part
of my new look.

06:00.123 --> 06:02.624
You know, top hat, monocle,
big stick.

06:02.692 --> 06:05.060
Mr. peanut.
Very sexy.

06:05.128 --> 06:07.863
So, uh, you showing up
here means

06:07.931 --> 06:10.399
I should call you, right?

06:10.466 --> 06:11.867
Call, don't call.

06:11.935 --> 06:13.802
Same as always.

06:18.341 --> 06:19.575
Play date over?

06:19.642 --> 06:20.742
Not if I can help it.

06:20.810 --> 06:22.044
Thief's name is Lenny Malone.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.446
Has a sheet--two petty thefts,
one assault,

06:24.514 --> 06:25.847
and now he's in the wind.

06:25.915 --> 06:27.549
We were in D.C. together.
We used to--

06:27.617 --> 06:29.885
it's clear what you used to.

06:29.953 --> 06:32.554
I'm more interested in what
happened here last night.

06:32.622 --> 06:36.091
Nothing.

06:36.159 --> 06:37.259
I just lost him.

06:41.197 --> 06:43.432
You two out of the clutches of
the Lakefield Police Department?

06:43.499 --> 06:46.668
Yes, thanks to Pete's
old girlfriend.

06:46.736 --> 06:48.503
Yeah, I probably don't want
to know what that means,

06:48.571 --> 06:50.606
but consider that
the frying pan.

06:50.673 --> 06:53.809
Now get back here and brace
yourselves for the fire.

06:59.349 --> 07:00.549
Hey.

07:00.617 --> 07:02.351
So what's this about a fire?

07:02.418 --> 07:04.186
Agents Bering and Lattimer,

07:04.253 --> 07:06.154
back from losing
another artifact.

07:06.222 --> 07:08.690
Once again involving
local police

07:08.758 --> 07:11.293
and unauthorized members
of the Secret Service.

07:11.361 --> 07:13.362
We didn't lose an artifact.
No, no, no, no.

07:13.429 --> 07:15.197
I don't know who you are--
Myka, Myka--guys.

07:17.433 --> 07:20.068
This is Benedict Valda.

07:20.136 --> 07:21.436
He's one of the Regents.

07:21.504 --> 07:24.139
Our Regents?
<i>The</i> Regents?

07:24.207 --> 07:25.941
No, Pete, the South Dakota
college board of Regents.

07:26.009 --> 07:27.075
Yes, the Regents.

07:27.143 --> 07:28.577
That's unusual, right?

07:28.645 --> 07:31.413
An in-person visit
from a Regent?

07:31.481 --> 07:35.417
Was unusual for the first
30 years that I worked here,

07:35.485 --> 07:37.552
but lately, I guess we just
can't be trusted to do our jobs.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.955
Mr. Valda could have done
all this by courier,

07:40.023 --> 07:41.857
not brought my agents back
from the field.

07:41.924 --> 07:45.727
That's quite enough,
Agent Nielsen.

07:45.795 --> 07:50.866
I brought these agents back
due to their repeated inability

07:50.933 --> 07:53.502
to protect this organization
from unwanted scrutiny.

08:01.310 --> 08:05.914
The Regents have decided
to become more hands-on.

08:05.982 --> 08:08.684
Moving forward,
you can expect me to be--

08:08.751 --> 08:10.085
all up in our dust traps?

08:10.153 --> 08:11.887
Shh.

08:11.954 --> 08:13.689
You, in particular,
miss Donovan,

08:13.756 --> 08:15.257
should consider yourself
on notice.

08:15.324 --> 08:17.459
Your inclusion
in this group at all

08:17.527 --> 08:18.794
is a matter of lively debate.

08:18.861 --> 08:20.128
Don't waste any time on me.

08:20.196 --> 08:21.596
I'm just tech support.
Claudia.

08:21.664 --> 08:23.865
Yes, you are.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.500
Nuh-uh.

08:25.568 --> 08:26.835
I got this.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.476
Remember what I said.

08:39.315 --> 08:40.881
I can input that.
I'll handle it.

08:40.950 --> 08:42.083
I want you two back
in Illinois.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.919
Find that stick.

08:43.986 --> 08:46.254
Artie?
Artie?

08:46.322 --> 08:47.589
What's going on?
Why can't I see that?

08:47.657 --> 08:49.758
Is there something
about me on there?

08:49.826 --> 08:53.095
I cannot believe
a Regent was just here

08:53.162 --> 08:55.497
and he's pissed at us.

08:55.565 --> 08:58.467
This is probably your fault.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.102
I never thought I'd be
in a rush to get back

09:00.169 --> 09:03.772
to Lakefield, Illinois.

09:07.577 --> 09:08.677
Pete, you coming?

09:08.745 --> 09:10.245
Uh, yeah.

09:10.313 --> 09:12.981
I got a thing first.

09:13.049 --> 09:14.883
I'm allowed to have a thing.

09:14.951 --> 09:16.284
Okay.

09:16.352 --> 09:19.087
You know, it's a strange time
to have a thing.

09:38.541 --> 09:41.109
So what's with
all the cloak and dagger?

09:41.177 --> 09:42.511
Keeping secrets from my team
really isn't my thing.

09:42.578 --> 09:45.380
Get in.

09:53.389 --> 09:56.825
Some of the Regents are
concerned about a pattern.

09:56.893 --> 09:58.493
Artifacts being used
for criminal gain.

09:58.561 --> 10:01.863
Like Malone
and the walking stick.

10:01.931 --> 10:04.199
But that's not so unusual.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.834
It is if it's someone
on the inside.

10:05.902 --> 10:08.370
We have every reason to believe
that there's a breach,

10:08.437 --> 10:10.572
possibly at a high level.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.175
We need your help
in finding out who.

10:13.242 --> 10:15.443
So if the Regents asked me
to throw the case,

10:15.511 --> 10:18.780
why was Valda
tearing me a new one?

10:18.848 --> 10:21.449
That visit was planned
some time ago.

10:21.517 --> 10:25.353
Any changes might have alerted
our culprit.

10:25.421 --> 10:27.088
Whoa, whoa.

10:27.156 --> 10:29.224
Look, okay, wait.

10:29.292 --> 10:31.927
You can't be thinking that
the breach is Artie or Myka.

10:31.994 --> 10:33.962
Have you forgotten
recent events?

10:34.030 --> 10:37.532
Could you doubt that anyone
could be compromised?

10:37.600 --> 10:41.069
Okay, so then why trust me?

10:41.137 --> 10:42.537
Because keeping secrets
from your team

10:42.605 --> 10:44.639
really isn't your thing,
which makes you

10:44.707 --> 10:47.843
the least likely suspect.

10:47.910 --> 10:52.113
Have I chosen poorly?

10:52.181 --> 10:53.615
No, ma'am.

10:53.683 --> 10:55.217
If our hunch is correct,

10:55.284 --> 10:57.118
Malone's supplier will try
to approach him

10:57.186 --> 10:59.087
for his cut of the take.

10:59.155 --> 11:00.989
Go to work as usual.

11:01.057 --> 11:02.324
Keep your eye on Malone.

11:02.391 --> 11:04.092
If you need to contact me,

11:04.160 --> 11:05.927
you break the window
at the end.

11:05.995 --> 11:08.196
This is strictly
between you and me.

11:08.264 --> 11:10.699
Understood?

11:10.766 --> 11:12.601
Good.

11:19.508 --> 11:21.810
Hey, uh...

11:21.878 --> 11:25.247
So are we, like, friends now?

11:25.314 --> 11:29.484
Right.
See ya.

11:29.552 --> 11:33.755
What are you hiding from me,
Artie?

11:33.823 --> 11:36.791
Schmancy new security measures.
I am impressed.

11:36.859 --> 11:38.360
But did we remember
all temp copies,

11:38.427 --> 11:39.694
mirror drives,
and image backups?

11:39.762 --> 11:42.864
Silly "wabbit."

11:42.932 --> 11:44.766
Too easy.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.938
"Donovan contingencies"?

11:50.006 --> 11:52.607
Cool.
I'm the star of a Ludlum novel.

11:52.675 --> 11:54.342
Look, it's encrypted.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.044
That's so cute.

11:56.112 --> 11:58.513
Chomp, chomp, chomp,
chomp, chomp, chomp.

12:03.886 --> 12:06.021
So you think the cops
already tossed it?

12:06.088 --> 12:09.157
No, this looks like Malone
grabbed some clothes and ran.

12:20.937 --> 12:23.004
Power's off.

12:27.009 --> 12:28.510
Uh...

12:28.577 --> 12:31.146
Are you trying to, you know,
pump the electricity

12:31.213 --> 12:32.547
up to the light or--

12:32.615 --> 12:34.516
no.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.668
Ha-ha!

12:53.736 --> 12:55.603
Geez, God, Myka.

12:55.671 --> 12:57.539
Well, is there something
down there?

12:57.606 --> 12:59.074
No.
It's nothing.

12:59.141 --> 13:01.109
I'm gonna go check his trash.

13:01.177 --> 13:02.911
You keep poking around here.

13:02.979 --> 13:04.245
Okay.
All right?

13:04.313 --> 13:07.215
Yeah, okay.

13:28.838 --> 13:30.138
Valda.

13:32.543 --> 13:33.710
Pete?

13:33.778 --> 13:38.815
Pete, where are you?

13:38.883 --> 13:40.250
Someone there?

13:45.122 --> 13:46.756
Pete?

13:46.824 --> 13:47.824
I got him!

13:47.892 --> 13:48.892
I got Malone!

13:48.960 --> 13:50.994
Come on!

13:56.267 --> 13:59.069
Wait a minute.
Wait--

13:59.136 --> 14:01.471
wait a minute.
I Tesla'd the guy.

14:01.539 --> 14:03.240
He was out cold.

14:03.307 --> 14:04.407
Well, was he meeting someone?

14:04.475 --> 14:05.976
Yeah, he was--

14:06.043 --> 14:07.711
I mean, no.

14:07.778 --> 14:10.080
I didn't see anybody else.

14:14.151 --> 14:15.252
You're sure it was Valda?

14:15.319 --> 14:16.786
1,000%.

14:16.854 --> 14:18.688
Did he see you?
I don't know.

14:18.756 --> 14:20.690
But now we know
it's not Artie or Myka,

14:20.758 --> 14:22.225
so let's bring them in
on this.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.927
Listen carefully.

14:23.995 --> 14:26.396
The Regents have kill authority
on anyone

14:26.464 --> 14:28.298
deemed a threat
to the Warehouse.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.934
Telling the others will only
put them in harm's way.

14:31.002 --> 14:33.270
Well, then let's bring this
guy down now.

14:33.337 --> 14:35.872
Leaping too quickly
with someone like Valda

14:35.940 --> 14:37.574
will put a bullet
in your head.

14:37.642 --> 14:39.175
What we need is evidence.

14:39.243 --> 14:41.378
Malone and the walking stick.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.979
And I need for you
to find him first

14:43.047 --> 14:46.449
before the police
or Agent Bering.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.852
I'll contact those Regents
I know I can trust.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.287
Patience, Mr. Lattimer.

14:50.354 --> 14:55.258
Right, well, I'm not
too good with patience.

14:55.326 --> 14:58.161
Challenge yourself.

15:09.874 --> 15:11.741
Hey.
Hey.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.443
Where have you been?

15:13.511 --> 15:15.245
I had a car thing.

15:15.313 --> 15:17.747
Wow.
You've been busy.

15:17.815 --> 15:20.050
This is everything from
Malone's apartment.

15:20.117 --> 15:23.086
You know, something doesn't
add up.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.822
Okay, I'm him, right?

15:25.890 --> 15:28.725
I have...

15:28.793 --> 15:30.560
The walking stick.

15:30.628 --> 15:33.997
I mean, why do I go back
to the apartment?

15:34.065 --> 15:36.967
Did I stash something else
that I need?

15:38.302 --> 15:40.236
Is that the walking stick?

15:40.304 --> 15:41.471
No, Pete.
This is a snack.

15:41.539 --> 15:42.505
Ah.

15:42.573 --> 15:44.207
Mmm.

15:49.413 --> 15:52.549
Myka?
Yeah?

15:52.617 --> 15:54.384
Did you check
the last number dialed?

15:54.452 --> 15:56.319
No, I didn't.

15:56.387 --> 15:57.787
That's a good idea.

15:57.855 --> 16:00.690
The phone Jack's over there.

16:10.835 --> 16:13.436
Ahem.

16:13.504 --> 16:16.573
Pines Place Motel.

16:16.641 --> 16:20.110
If he wasn't meeting anyone
else in the apartment,

16:20.177 --> 16:21.778
then why was he there?

16:21.846 --> 16:25.982
Yeah, got me.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.250
Is there anything?

16:27.318 --> 16:28.418
Nope.

16:28.486 --> 16:31.454
The last number dialed
was take-out.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.390
Huh.

16:49.473 --> 16:50.573
I'm gonna go check his trash.

16:50.641 --> 16:52.042
You keep poking around here.

16:52.109 --> 16:53.677
I got a thing first.

16:53.744 --> 16:54.844
I'm allowed to have a thing.

16:54.912 --> 16:57.647
I lost him.

17:01.285 --> 17:02.819
You want to talk about this?

17:02.887 --> 17:04.988
This is why I said
leave it alone.

17:05.056 --> 17:08.023
Then maybe you shouldn't have
put it on the computer.

17:08.092 --> 17:09.759
That's like me leaving a cake
out with a note on it

17:09.827 --> 17:12.095
that says, "not for Artie."

17:12.163 --> 17:13.863
That was one time and I--

17:13.931 --> 17:15.732
don't you have a boyfriend
that you could be irritating

17:15.800 --> 17:16.965
instead of me?

17:17.034 --> 17:18.501
He dumped me.
Oh, I didn't know.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.637
Do you want me to call him?
Artie!

17:20.704 --> 17:22.638
This is a list of ways
to kill me.

17:22.707 --> 17:25.474
Oh, they're not...

17:25.542 --> 17:27.077
All killing you.

17:27.144 --> 17:29.546
There's other options here.

17:29.613 --> 17:30.847
"Erase her memory"?

17:30.915 --> 17:32.449
Well, that's comparatively
humane.

17:32.516 --> 17:34.718
"Drop her in a
non-English-speaking country"?

17:34.785 --> 17:36.152
See, they're just trying
to stall for time.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.353
They know you're gonna find
your way back.

17:37.421 --> 17:38.955
That doesn't make me
feel any better!

17:39.023 --> 17:42.058
Don't you think that there's
a file like this on all of us?

17:42.126 --> 17:44.227
Don't you know that there's
one with my name on it?

17:44.295 --> 17:46.896
And are you okay with that?

17:46.964 --> 17:49.733
Claudia...

17:49.800 --> 17:52.102
You are a valued member
of this team

17:52.169 --> 17:54.771
and no one is gonna erase
your memory

17:54.839 --> 17:57.373
or dispose of your body
in a vat of acid.

17:57.441 --> 18:00.443
Is that on here too?

18:00.511 --> 18:01.544
Oh, my God.

18:01.612 --> 18:03.012
It's there?
Yeah.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.147
Uh-huh.
Number 11.

18:04.215 --> 18:08.485
Artie?

18:08.552 --> 18:10.520
I think Pete's drinking again.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.724
What?

18:14.792 --> 18:16.359
No.

18:16.427 --> 18:18.561
What?

18:18.629 --> 18:20.163
No, no, no.

18:20.231 --> 18:21.731
What?

18:21.799 --> 18:24.367
We're just asking because
we're worried about you.

18:25.736 --> 18:26.803
Yeah, bro.
We're your friends.

18:26.871 --> 18:30.473
Tell me this is some
kind of a--

18:30.541 --> 18:33.109
a weird, uncomfortable
surprise party.

18:33.177 --> 18:35.578
Pete, you've been acting
strange this whole case.

18:35.646 --> 18:36.946
You been lying.

18:37.014 --> 18:38.782
You've been making up excuses
to be alone.

18:38.849 --> 18:41.417
Look, your hands are shaking.

18:41.485 --> 18:45.321
For crying out loud,
you--

18:45.389 --> 18:47.223
you--

18:53.998 --> 18:57.934
I'm sorry.

18:58.002 --> 19:02.305
You guys, this is sweet, really,
but you're wrong, okay??

19:02.373 --> 19:03.673
You're wrong.

19:03.741 --> 19:05.775
In eight years,
I haven't even had

19:05.843 --> 19:08.144
a virgin daiquiri.

19:08.212 --> 19:11.247
Then what?

19:11.315 --> 19:13.149
I'm not drinking.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.741
That was quick.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.677
Secrets are a naughty thing,
Peter.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.145
You listen up, Valda.

19:42.213 --> 19:45.381
Look behind the tree
in front of you.

20:02.433 --> 20:03.733
Valda--

20:03.801 --> 20:05.635
you two have been
busy little bees.

20:05.703 --> 20:07.370
She'll never see your signal,
by the way.

20:07.438 --> 20:09.405
Where is she?
She's alive.

20:09.473 --> 20:12.942
I have a man watching her
through the scope of a rifle.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.011
I need you to tie up one loose
end for me.

20:15.079 --> 20:17.347
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

20:17.414 --> 20:19.282
Mr. Malone.
Where is he?

20:19.350 --> 20:22.118
No, no, first, you call your
man off Mrs. Frederic.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.686
I'm afraid not.

20:23.754 --> 20:26.656
When I call you again,
be ready to deliver Malone.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.124
Now how do I know you won't
kill her anyway?

20:28.192 --> 20:30.593
You're in no position
to quibble, Peter.

20:30.661 --> 20:32.295
I could kill your whole team.

20:32.363 --> 20:34.530
Hey!
The others don't know anything!

20:34.598 --> 20:36.232
Okay?
You leave them out of this.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.835
That's entirely up to you.
Are we clear?

20:38.903 --> 20:41.104
Here's what's clear, pal.

20:41.171 --> 20:42.839
You tell me I have something
you want

20:42.907 --> 20:45.375
and then you threaten
my friends.

20:45.442 --> 20:47.744
So you are going down.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.412
Game on.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.414
Game on!

20:54.551 --> 21:02.358
♪ ♪

21:16.774 --> 21:18.474
He's not at the B&B.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.877
His cell goes straight
to voicemail.

21:20.945 --> 21:23.446
He's taking himself
off the grid.

21:23.514 --> 21:25.381
He left this.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.576
Agent Kate Logan.

21:44.755 --> 21:46.890
Pete Lattimer.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.192
Damn it.

21:49.260 --> 21:51.795
Okay, uh, tell her
I need an address

21:51.852 --> 21:53.753
for a Benedict Valda.

21:53.821 --> 21:55.888
V-a-l-d-a.

21:55.956 --> 21:58.825
Thanks.

22:08.635 --> 22:11.537
Lakefield.

22:11.605 --> 22:13.639
Pines Place Motel.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.854
Hey, buddy boy.

22:27.921 --> 22:28.955
Remember me?

22:29.022 --> 22:30.790
I'm the guy from the museum

22:30.858 --> 22:32.658
you tried to kill
with the battle Axe.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.360
Now how do I find
Benedict Valda?

22:34.428 --> 22:35.628
Who?
Valda!

22:35.696 --> 22:37.230
Ah!

22:37.297 --> 22:39.165
The guy you met
in the alley.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.601
Or should I hand you over
to him like he wants?

22:41.668 --> 22:44.570
I don't know any Valda.

22:44.638 --> 22:46.139
Okay, all right, look.

22:46.206 --> 22:47.640
I took the stick
from the exhibit.

22:47.708 --> 22:48.941
I admit it.

22:49.009 --> 22:50.143
You're working together.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.612
I saw you paying him off.

22:52.679 --> 22:53.880
Look, you're crazy, man.

22:53.947 --> 22:55.782
No, no! Okay.
Where is it?

22:55.849 --> 22:57.016
It's under the bed.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.918
It's right under the bed.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.996
Hey!
Hey!

23:21.642 --> 23:23.309
Hey, handsome.

23:23.377 --> 23:26.112
What can I get you?

23:26.180 --> 23:27.513
You feeling all right?

23:27.581 --> 23:28.781
Um, yeah.

23:28.849 --> 23:31.884
It's just a long night.
That's all.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.586
Thank God.
Hey.

23:33.654 --> 23:35.288
Coffee?

23:35.355 --> 23:36.522
Maybe you should stick
with decaf?

23:36.590 --> 23:37.723
That's a good idea.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.724
Two, please.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.927
Coming up.

23:40.994 --> 23:43.896
Okay, first, that message
was the least-romantic

23:43.964 --> 23:45.398
Booty call ever.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.067
What is with this
Valda character?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.269
Why?
Why?

23:50.337 --> 23:51.471
Did something happen?

23:51.538 --> 23:54.907
Guy doesn't exist on paper,

23:54.975 --> 23:56.742
but ever since I poked,
my place was trashed,

23:56.810 --> 23:59.345
my phone's been bugged,
and someone's been tailing me.

23:59.413 --> 24:02.849
When I find that S.O.B.,
I am gonna--

24:02.916 --> 24:04.550
don't worry.

24:04.618 --> 24:06.085
I'm a big girl,
but someone's definitely

24:06.153 --> 24:08.855
sending a message.

24:08.922 --> 24:09.889
Either that or you've gone
way too far

24:09.957 --> 24:11.891
making up an excuse to see me.

24:11.959 --> 24:13.493
No.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.594
It isn't me.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.662
You're still hot,
but not

24:16.730 --> 24:18.831
"trash your place just
to get a date" hot.

24:18.899 --> 24:19.899
It's happened.

24:19.967 --> 24:21.467
I'm sure.

24:21.535 --> 24:25.204
Okay, then...

24:25.272 --> 24:26.806
Think it's time you let me in.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.908
What's the division
you're working for?

24:28.976 --> 24:34.614
Well, let's just say
I'm in containment of threats.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.048
To the President?

24:36.116 --> 24:39.352
To the planet.

24:39.419 --> 24:41.921
Okay, okay. Right.
I know. I know.

24:41.989 --> 24:44.223
I know it sounds like
I'm wearing a tinfoil hat

24:44.291 --> 24:46.425
to keep the aliens from stealing
my thoughts,

24:46.493 --> 24:48.995
but, Kate, I'm serious.

24:49.062 --> 24:50.763
I can't tell you what I do.

24:54.134 --> 24:56.002
Thanks.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.941
Ahh.

25:02.009 --> 25:05.478
So Valda,
how does he fit in?

25:05.546 --> 25:07.780
He's way up the food chain,
and bad.

25:07.848 --> 25:09.582
Like, Keyser Soze bad.

25:09.650 --> 25:13.286
I don't think this is decaf.

25:13.353 --> 25:16.222
Okay, how are you supposed
to find him?

25:16.290 --> 25:19.325
When he came to visit us...

25:19.393 --> 25:21.093
He had a driver and a limo.

25:21.161 --> 25:22.762
So they had to get gas,
right?

25:22.829 --> 25:26.265
Maybe he used
a credit card or,

25:26.333 --> 25:28.067
you know, got themselves
on camera.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.169
You're going to check
every gas station,

25:30.237 --> 25:33.105
restaurant, and rest stop
for 100 miles?

25:33.173 --> 25:35.841
Where I work, there's only,
like, six.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.878
Still a lot of legwork.

25:38.946 --> 25:42.081
Look, if your partner and
everyone you worked with

25:42.149 --> 25:46.485
had their lives threatened,
wouldn't you do it?

25:46.553 --> 25:49.589
Yeah.

25:49.656 --> 25:53.826
Thanks for dragging me
into your fun world.

25:53.894 --> 25:57.597
I thought you were happy
to see me.

25:57.664 --> 26:02.635
I kind of liked you better
when you were helpless,

26:02.703 --> 26:04.837
pantsless Pete.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.043
Well, the pants
are imminently removable.

26:30.831 --> 26:32.565
What?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.667
I honestly had no idea

26:34.735 --> 26:36.335
this is where my day
was headed.

26:36.403 --> 26:39.538
Everyone's hands
where I can see 'em!

26:39.606 --> 26:40.940
Logan, get out of here.

26:41.008 --> 26:44.744
What?

26:44.811 --> 26:46.879
Myka, what the hell
are you doing?

26:46.947 --> 26:47.913
What am I doing?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.181
You've gone AWOL.

26:49.249 --> 26:50.783
You've stolen an artifact

26:50.851 --> 26:52.318
and you won't tell anyone
what's going on.

26:52.386 --> 26:53.352
What am I supposed to think?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.454
Mrs. Frederic can explain it.

26:55.522 --> 26:58.290
Mrs. Frederic is missing.

26:58.358 --> 26:59.859
Valda is calling the shots

26:59.926 --> 27:01.694
and he thinks you had something
to do with it.

27:01.762 --> 27:03.696
Myka, Valda is the guy
I'm after.

27:03.764 --> 27:05.965
If Mrs. Frederic is missing,

27:06.033 --> 27:08.601
then he either has her
or she is dead.

27:08.669 --> 27:12.004
Look, all I know
is I have my orders.

27:12.072 --> 27:15.808
Don't make me do this
the hard way, Pete.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.189
Ah!

27:36.430 --> 27:38.664
Come on!

27:38.732 --> 27:40.199
Pete,
do not get in that car!

27:40.267 --> 27:42.468
Pete, please!
Hands on the wheel!

27:42.536 --> 27:44.203
Hey, Myka!
Myka, put the gun away

27:44.271 --> 27:45.805
and we'll talk, okay?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.840
You have no idea what Valda
is capable of!

27:47.908 --> 27:50.042
Pete, just come with me
and we'll sort this out, okay?

27:50.110 --> 27:51.043
Lattimer, get in the car!

27:51.111 --> 27:52.244
Logan, please!

27:52.312 --> 27:54.447
I'm just trying to keep
you alive, okay?

27:54.514 --> 27:57.750
Take the shot.
Take the shot!

27:57.818 --> 28:00.820
No!

28:02.823 --> 28:04.790
Oh, my God.
Kate.

28:04.858 --> 28:10.129
Pete!

28:10.197 --> 28:11.564
Wait.
Excuse me, ma'am.

28:11.631 --> 28:13.799
Ma'am, you c--

28:17.471 --> 28:18.938
it's all right.

28:19.005 --> 28:23.375
Kate, Pete's in trouble.

28:24.131 --> 28:26.132
Pete's stuck in some
sort of paranoid delusion.

28:26.832 --> 28:29.667
The way that he ran.
The note.

28:29.735 --> 28:32.270
He thinks that someone
is out to get him.

28:32.338 --> 28:34.305
We don't have any
of the details yet,

28:34.373 --> 28:38.576
but we think that
he was affected by, um....

28:38.644 --> 28:39.777
Something during a mission.

28:39.845 --> 28:43.147
Right.
Your "secret" missions.

28:43.215 --> 28:44.649
Why come to me?

28:44.717 --> 28:46.284
Well, one, he called you,
so whatever's going on

28:46.352 --> 28:50.421
in his head, you must
be a part of it and...

28:50.489 --> 28:53.191
Two...

28:53.259 --> 28:56.127
Well...

28:56.195 --> 28:57.595
He's back on your turf.

28:57.663 --> 29:03.001
We pulled this off a Chicago
city surveillance Cam.

29:03.068 --> 29:04.302
Yeah.

29:04.370 --> 29:08.172
What is he doing?

29:08.240 --> 29:11.943
I think he thinks
that he's kissing you.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.178
Uh-huh?

29:14.246 --> 29:17.081
But it could be you though,
right?

29:17.149 --> 29:18.249
It's highly doubtful.

29:18.317 --> 29:20.885
My money's on you.

29:20.953 --> 29:22.787
Um, he left you a message?

29:22.855 --> 29:27.792
Yeah, it was weird.

29:27.860 --> 29:33.431
Here.

29:33.499 --> 29:36.601
So why is he fixated on Valda?

29:36.669 --> 29:39.304
I think his mind is scrambling
together details

29:39.371 --> 29:41.239
from his life the way you
do when you're dreaming.

29:41.307 --> 29:42.840
He's constructing
some kind of fantasy

29:42.908 --> 29:44.976
with Valda and Malone,
the walking stick.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.378
Well, could this walking stick
have caused it?

29:47.446 --> 29:49.080
It didn't affect Malone.

29:49.148 --> 29:52.483
No, I think whatever this is,
it started in that museum.

29:52.551 --> 29:56.321
Did Pete touch anything
while you were there?

29:56.388 --> 29:57.589
Artie, it's Pete.

29:57.656 --> 29:58.957
It would be easier
to list the things

29:59.024 --> 30:00.858
that he didn't touch.

30:00.926 --> 30:02.527
Oh, God.
Okay, show me.

30:02.595 --> 30:05.330
Okay, he played with,
um,

30:05.397 --> 30:07.231
some of these billiard balls.

30:07.299 --> 30:08.800
Myka, Myka, what else?
What else? What else?

30:08.867 --> 30:12.570
Then he played
with these glasses

30:12.638 --> 30:15.373
and this pipe.

30:15.441 --> 30:18.042
Why did you let him touch
all those things?

30:18.110 --> 30:20.545
What am I,
his kindergarten teacher?

30:20.613 --> 30:22.513
Plus, you know,
we didn't know there

30:22.581 --> 30:25.016
would be two artifacts
in the same place.

30:25.084 --> 30:28.286
Myka, it's a museum.

30:28.354 --> 30:31.022
It is filled with things
from historical events.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.557
Anything there could
be an artifact.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.126
You cannot let him touch
anything.

30:35.194 --> 30:37.028
Artie, it's Pete, okay?

30:37.096 --> 30:39.597
It's a win when he doesn't
lick anything.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.934
Yes, what else?
All right, fine.

30:43.002 --> 30:47.271
All right, he put
this thing in his ear.

30:47.339 --> 30:49.207
That's a good way to get an
infection if you ask me, but...

30:49.274 --> 30:50.541
Yeah.

30:50.609 --> 30:51.743
Then he--

30:51.810 --> 30:55.747
oh, he clicked this telegraph,
then--

30:55.814 --> 30:57.281
oh, right, then he--
wait, wait, wait.

30:57.349 --> 30:58.683
What?

30:58.751 --> 31:00.318
Telegraph?
Go back. Go back. Go back.

31:00.386 --> 31:01.919
Show me the telegraph.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.421
Here you go.

31:03.489 --> 31:05.790
It's military.
1860s.

31:05.858 --> 31:07.191
Telegraph Island, Oman.

31:07.259 --> 31:09.060
Telegraph Island?

31:09.128 --> 31:10.261
Oh, my.
Wait, wait, wait.

31:10.329 --> 31:13.865
I know that.
That sounds familiar.

31:13.932 --> 31:15.400
Myka, wait.
Wait one second.

31:15.467 --> 31:17.602
All right.
Telegraph Island.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.771
A remote outpost between
England and India

31:19.838 --> 31:20.872
in the mid-1800s.

31:20.939 --> 31:23.174
Reported that every--

31:23.242 --> 31:27.378
every soldier posted there
went violently insane.

31:27.446 --> 31:29.380
Well, that--

31:29.448 --> 31:31.949
it sounds "artifacty," right?

31:32.017 --> 31:34.919
You think?

31:34.987 --> 31:36.688
No, wait.

31:36.755 --> 31:38.589
It hasn't affected anyone since.

31:38.657 --> 31:40.258
Well, is this it or not?

31:40.325 --> 31:42.660
Only one way to find out.

31:53.972 --> 31:55.473
Pete, it's Myka.

31:55.541 --> 31:58.676
Just tell me
that you can hear me.

31:58.744 --> 32:01.913
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear you.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.015
I just don't know
what to say to you.

32:04.083 --> 32:08.186
I keep--I keep telling
myself it wasn't our fault.

32:08.253 --> 32:10.254
And I couldn't
say anything to you,

32:10.322 --> 32:13.091
because I was trying
to protect you.

32:15.427 --> 32:17.328
I'm here, Pete.
I'm safe.

32:17.396 --> 32:18.629
Got Katie killed.

32:18.697 --> 32:20.398
What?
No, no, Pete.

32:20.466 --> 32:22.166
Kate's--
Kate's alive, okay?

32:22.234 --> 32:23.634
I just left her.

32:23.702 --> 32:26.204
Pete, you've been affected
by an artifact,

32:26.271 --> 32:27.739
the telegraph.

32:27.806 --> 32:29.674
I think you're hallucinating.

32:29.742 --> 32:32.443
Valda's filled your head
with lies.

32:32.511 --> 32:34.812
But I'm about
to fix all that.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.683
So you, and Leena,
Artie, Claudia,

32:38.751 --> 32:41.085
you guys will all be safe.

32:41.153 --> 32:42.553
Pete, no, okay?

32:42.621 --> 32:44.922
Don't do whatever it is
you're about to do.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.592
Okay?

32:47.659 --> 32:50.361
You might
feel something strange.

33:04.543 --> 33:05.710
Anything?

33:05.778 --> 33:07.879
I've been listening, Peter.
Valda?

33:07.946 --> 33:09.781
Pete, did you hear
what I just said?

33:09.848 --> 33:11.048
Where's Myka?

33:11.116 --> 33:13.951
Now you've compromised
the others.

33:14.019 --> 33:16.287
Do you realize
what I'll have to do?

33:16.355 --> 33:20.191
Valda, I'll trade you
Malone for Mrs. Frederic.

33:20.259 --> 33:21.893
I don't know how
to reach you.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.195
You meet me
at the Kemper recycling yard.

33:36.942 --> 33:38.910
Hey, boss.

33:43.415 --> 33:44.649
There's no effect.

33:44.716 --> 33:46.484
He's still inside
of whatever's going on.

33:46.552 --> 33:49.053
At least now we know
where he's going.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.488
And I think I have
just the thing

33:50.556 --> 33:51.756
to restore Pete's
neural rhythm.

34:05.237 --> 34:07.138
Agent Lattimer!

34:07.206 --> 34:09.739
I understand you want
to speak with me.

34:17.549 --> 34:19.150
What in God's name--

34:19.217 --> 34:21.284
shut up.

34:21.353 --> 34:22.853
I've heard enough
of your voice

34:22.920 --> 34:24.989
to last a lifetime.

34:31.429 --> 34:34.398
I don't know what this
is all about, Agent Lattimer,

34:34.466 --> 34:36.199
but you have my attention.

34:36.268 --> 34:39.637
All right?

34:39.705 --> 34:41.806
You recognize this?

34:44.775 --> 34:46.911
It appears to be the artifact
that you were after,

34:46.978 --> 34:48.212
the walking stick.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.780
"It appears to be the--

34:49.848 --> 34:51.514
the artifact you're after."

34:51.583 --> 34:54.118
Shut up!

34:54.186 --> 34:56.888
We're all alone
out here, Valda.

34:56.955 --> 35:00.691
Quit playing the game.

35:00.759 --> 35:02.526
I got the stick,
I got Malone,

35:02.594 --> 35:05.062
and I got you.

35:05.130 --> 35:06.831
Now what did you do
with Mrs. Frederic?

35:06.899 --> 35:09.066
Mrs. Frederic?

35:09.134 --> 35:11.736
Look, I want to help you.

35:11.803 --> 35:12.904
But none of this can be--

35:12.971 --> 35:14.272
oh, yeah, yeah.

35:14.339 --> 35:16.007
Yeah, yeah!

35:16.074 --> 35:19.243
Myka tried that line on me.

35:19.311 --> 35:21.412
She was a good little soldier.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.515
She fed me your garbage
about a telegraph

35:24.583 --> 35:26.851
that's making me see things.

35:26.919 --> 35:28.052
Telegraph?

35:28.120 --> 35:30.421
Time is running out,
Benedict.

35:30.489 --> 35:31.622
Telegraph.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.424
What do you remember?

35:33.492 --> 35:35.026
Is there anything
unusual about it?

35:44.469 --> 35:46.003
Think!

36:08.160 --> 36:10.695
Just stop trying
to confuse me!

36:10.762 --> 36:11.662
I'm not confusing you.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.264
You're seeing clearly.

36:13.332 --> 36:15.366
Try to remember.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.168
I said shut up!

36:25.077 --> 36:27.078
Pete!

36:27.145 --> 36:29.313
Agent Bering.

36:29.381 --> 36:30.514
Be careful.

36:30.582 --> 36:33.250
Myka!

36:33.318 --> 36:35.987
Look, this is gonna sound
kinda freaky,

36:36.054 --> 36:38.189
but...

36:38.256 --> 36:40.091
Are you guys really here?

36:40.158 --> 36:43.260
'Cause Valda's been messing
with my head,

36:43.328 --> 36:45.162
and I don't know
what's real anymore.

36:45.230 --> 36:47.765
Yeah, we're really here.

36:47.833 --> 36:50.034
Okay? Pete?

36:50.102 --> 36:52.770
And we're gonna help you
get outta this.

36:57.609 --> 36:59.777
Oh, they're here, Peter.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.012
Almost ready.

37:01.079 --> 37:02.046
You really think
I'd come here

37:02.114 --> 37:03.047
without backup?

37:03.115 --> 37:05.449
Myka, you and Artie,

37:05.517 --> 37:06.584
you gotta get outta here.

37:06.651 --> 37:08.119
He's got--

37:08.186 --> 37:11.856
he's got snipers
all over the place.

37:21.266 --> 37:23.334
Where is Mrs. Frederic?

37:23.402 --> 37:25.269
Artie.
Agent Nielsen!

37:25.337 --> 37:27.972
I am aware of the urgency.

37:28.040 --> 37:33.110
I've got something that'll reset
his neural rhythm--

37:33.178 --> 37:35.246
the original studio master
of <i>Oye Como Va.</i>

37:43.155 --> 37:45.189
Music to die by,
hey, Peter?

37:45.257 --> 37:47.925
Just stop it!

37:47.993 --> 37:50.294
You stop!

37:50.362 --> 37:52.630
Ahh!

37:57.369 --> 37:58.669
Okay, listen to me, Pete.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.273
I really need you
to not do that again, okay?

38:02.340 --> 38:06.477
The irony is Myka's
gonna kill you for me.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.512
She has to protect
the Regent.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.448
And then I'll kill them

38:10.515 --> 38:11.982
before your body's
even cold.

38:14.019 --> 38:15.786
This music
is just not getting through.

38:15.854 --> 38:17.621
He's still listening
to that telegraph.

38:18.890 --> 38:21.926
Myka, he wants
to kill us all.

38:21.993 --> 38:24.395
You and Artie
just get outta here!

38:24.463 --> 38:26.030
Agent Nielsen!

38:26.098 --> 38:28.099
Yeah, I'm--
I'm working on it.

38:28.166 --> 38:30.668
You back off!
You hear me?

38:30.735 --> 38:33.070
You back off
or I'll kill him!

38:33.138 --> 38:34.872
I've got to find
something that can--

38:37.476 --> 38:38.843
I've got it.

38:38.910 --> 38:41.278
Okay, Pete,
I'm gonna come over there,

38:41.346 --> 38:44.682
and you're gonna
give me your gun, okay?

38:44.749 --> 38:46.750
Here it comes, Peter.

38:46.818 --> 38:48.385
Stop!

39:18.216 --> 39:23.420
♪ ♪

39:23.488 --> 39:26.157
Pete?

39:26.224 --> 39:28.859
Pete?

39:28.927 --> 39:30.494
Pete?

39:30.562 --> 39:32.663
I hope the aural
and visual combination

39:32.731 --> 39:35.299
shocked him back
to reality

39:35.367 --> 39:37.501
and didn't turn him
into a...

39:37.569 --> 39:38.636
Ow.

39:38.703 --> 39:39.970
My eye's already open, Artie.

39:40.038 --> 39:41.338
Geez.

39:44.743 --> 39:47.745
Hey, are you okay?

39:47.812 --> 39:50.181
Uh...

39:50.248 --> 39:53.417
I have no freakin' idea.

39:53.485 --> 39:54.885
Well improvised,
Agent Nielsen.

39:54.953 --> 39:57.588
Yes, there is a madness
to the method.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.790
Agent Nielsen.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.493
Yes?

40:02.561 --> 40:03.861
Oh.

40:03.929 --> 40:07.164
Yeah, of course.

40:07.232 --> 40:08.499
What happened?

40:08.567 --> 40:10.167
It's a long story.

40:25.559 --> 40:29.029
Oh, God.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.597
Are you here to kill me?

40:30.665 --> 40:32.532
If I was,
you'd already be dead,

40:32.600 --> 40:34.634
and I'd be halfway
to dinner.

40:34.702 --> 40:36.736
Yeah, you know, it's just

40:36.804 --> 40:38.204
'cause I shot at a Regent.

40:38.272 --> 40:39.939
Mr. Valda,
though unhappy,

40:40.007 --> 40:41.775
understands
the circumstances.

40:41.842 --> 40:44.110
Yeah, well...

40:44.178 --> 40:45.979
I'm not sure I understand
the circumstances.

40:46.047 --> 40:48.281
The telegraph
seems to have tapped into

40:48.349 --> 40:50.684
some subliminal anxiety,

40:50.751 --> 40:54.354
not surprising given what
you've all been through of late.

40:54.422 --> 40:56.289
Yeah.

41:02.463 --> 41:04.230
Sorry.

41:04.298 --> 41:07.067
I just wanted to make sure
you were real.

41:07.134 --> 41:10.103
Take some time off,
Agent Lattimer.

41:10.171 --> 41:11.337
Yes, ma'am.

41:11.405 --> 41:15.608
I'm just gonna
finish up these reports.

41:15.676 --> 41:18.111
And, you know,
it's funny, we--

41:21.916 --> 41:23.817
How does she do that?

41:23.884 --> 41:25.719
I'll be at the Warehouse.

41:25.786 --> 41:27.120
Oh, Artie, hey, listen,

41:27.188 --> 41:29.189
I understand the need
for that contingency file.

41:29.256 --> 41:32.826
So if you ever
have to take me out...

41:39.934 --> 41:40.900
This is how
you want to die?

41:40.968 --> 41:42.435
Yeah.

41:42.503 --> 41:44.971
Well...

41:45.039 --> 41:46.773
I do know how to reach
David Bowie.

41:46.841 --> 41:48.675
Yes!

41:48.743 --> 41:49.776
You rock.

41:51.579 --> 41:53.146
Oh, Pete, there's an envelope
on the table for you,

41:53.214 --> 41:54.481
from Kate Logan.

41:54.548 --> 41:56.649
Ooh.
Are you gonna call her?

41:56.717 --> 41:58.017
Nah, I don't think so.

41:58.085 --> 41:59.285
Well, why not?

41:59.353 --> 42:01.421
I mean, you must have
some feelings for her.

42:01.489 --> 42:04.057
She was, after all,
in your fantasy.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.626
Oh, well, thank you,
Dr. Freud.

42:06.694 --> 42:07.861
Open it.

42:07.928 --> 42:09.362
Open it.

42:19.507 --> 42:21.174
"Hope you're better.

42:21.242 --> 42:22.742
"Myka forgot this.

42:22.810 --> 42:26.012
Thought you'd want it."

42:26.080 --> 42:26.946
Oh, God.
What?

42:27.014 --> 42:28.448
Just don't play that.

42:28.516 --> 42:30.884
I mean, you're not interested
in her anyways, right?

42:30.951 --> 42:33.720
So you can't--oh.
Pete, you're just--

42:33.788 --> 42:36.923
what? What?
I'm not unless she is.

42:36.991 --> 42:38.691
Ugh, oh, God.

42:38.759 --> 42:41.060
You're gonna be embarrassed.

42:41.128 --> 42:42.462
Pete, I'm sorry.

42:49.136 --> 42:52.639
I'm so sorry.
I'm so--

42:52.706 --> 42:54.040
Hey! Hey! Hey!

42:54.108 --> 42:57.644
Even by myself,
I still got moves.

42:57.711 --> 42:59.412
Oh. Oh.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.248
Yes, yes, yes.

43:02.316 --> 43:04.784
You know they called me
"Gene Simmons" in High School.

43:04.852 --> 43:06.052
Don't stop.

43:08.022 --> 43:08.922
You're insane.
