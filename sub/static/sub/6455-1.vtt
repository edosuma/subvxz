00:28.779 --> 00:30.446
She would
say things like,

00:30.572 --> 00:33.157
"Isn't every story
a story of betrayal?"

00:33.450 --> 00:35.660
"No, that's not true,"
I thought.

00:35.828 --> 00:39.414
But I could never say that.
I could only agree with her.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.083
It was too much fun
to agree with her.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.376
I was sleeping.
Turn that off!

01:00.436 --> 01:01.644
Sorry.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.147
I'm your roommate.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.316
My name is Laura
and I'm going on safari...

01:07.484 --> 01:11.654
...and I'm bringing with me
a car for Carrie...

01:11.822 --> 01:13.531
...a rolling pin, Ruth...

01:15.325 --> 01:16.993
...a jar for Juman...

01:17.161 --> 01:19.162
and a...

01:19.496 --> 01:20.872
Uh... Shit!

01:21.039 --> 01:22.665
A tracking device for Tracy.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.002
Right,
a tracking device for Tracy...

01:26.170 --> 01:29.547
...and a lighter for me,
Laura.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.275
Aren't you coming
to convocation?

01:31.383 --> 01:32.717
You're going to that shit?

01:32.885 --> 01:34.343
Yeah, isn't everyone?

01:34.511 --> 01:36.679
I don't think anyone is going.

01:36.847 --> 01:37.847
Except rapists.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.348
What? Why rapists?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.768
Or Christians
and home-schooled kids.

01:41.852 --> 01:42.894
Nobody really goes.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.646
I think it's just
a candle-lighting ceremony.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.274
How do you already
know all this stuff?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.901
School hasn't even
started yet.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.877
This is a starting point.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.213
This is what college is for.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.883
We're here to teach you
to write and think.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.844
A "B"? That's so annoying.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.932
I have trouble
with procrastinating.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.267
Did you ever think of...

02:23.393 --> 02:25.019
just getting
your work in on time?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.856
Yes, I have thought of that.
I have trouble doing it.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.942
Maybe you want to try
a little harder.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.444
Okay. Thanks.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.905
Harder. I'll try that.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.116
What comes to mind

02:39.243 --> 02:40.993
when you think
of the Renaissance?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.203
I think of the Renaissance

02:42.287 --> 02:44.413
as being very plush,
like a lot of velvet...

02:44.581 --> 02:47.500
...inlaid with jewels,
brocades, that kind of thing.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.001
Thank you.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.689
I was actually
asking about literature,

02:50.754 --> 02:52.588
but that was very nice.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.011
Hey, um, is the party
at the end of the hall?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.304
Did you get an invitation?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.639
No.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.224
Then, no.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.435
She's being a bitch.
Yes, it's right down the hall.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.818
I could be anywhere.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.323
It doesn't even
feel like New York.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.491
And by trying to participate,

03:20.617 --> 03:22.118
I'm somehow
not fitting in even less.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.953
Aren't you meeting friends
in classes?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.997
Mom, nobody meets
friends in classes.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.832
Oh, okay. I didn't know.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.417
You know the feeling
of being at a party

03:29.501 --> 03:30.960
where you don't know anybody?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.962
It's like that the whole time.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.839
That sounds uncomfortable.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.257
Did you get my email?

03:36.341 --> 03:37.967
With the reading?
Do you like it?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.135
I liked it.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.219
I think
there's a darker element

03:40.304 --> 03:42.096
to what Shakespeare's saying,
but I liked it.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.472
It's Thanksgiving weekend,

03:43.599 --> 03:45.641
so we'll have
a built-in rehearsal dinner...

03:45.809 --> 03:47.143
...on Thursday at the house.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.311
Right.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.687
It'll be the first time
the two families

03:49.813 --> 03:51.314
are all in the same room.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.857
Oh, Stevie.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.609
Oh, Trace.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.987
You know I was very unhappy
for a very long time.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.989
But I'm glad your dad and I
stayed together...

04:00.157 --> 04:02.037
...till you and your brother
were out of school.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.701
I was not out of school.
You broke up

04:03.827 --> 04:05.453
when I was a junior
in high school.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.872
On your way out of the home.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.499
I love you, Mom.
Don't be worried.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.335
I know, honey.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.961
So after you do that,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.297
Brooke will read a poem
that she's written.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.300
You should call Brooke.
She's in New York, you know.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.802
I'm so bad at calling people
I don't know.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.220
I hear she's fun.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.430
She's, like, 30,

04:24.514 --> 04:25.556
and living in New York
with a life.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.099
She doesn't need to hear
from an 18-year-old

04:27.184 --> 04:28.517
she's tenuously connected to.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.685
She's going to be your sister,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.354
that doesn't sound
tenuous to me.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.772
And you have
plenty to talk about,

04:32.856 --> 04:34.523
you're both doing readings
at our wedding.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.900
Aces!

04:36.068 --> 04:38.569
You aren't sarcastic,
don't pretend to be.

04:38.737 --> 04:39.820
Okay.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.199
Nothing's higher than the law.
That's the whole point.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.992
Antigone thinks
she's above the law,

04:45.077 --> 04:46.410
but she's not.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.664
Like, a celebrity
in a car crash or something.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.499
That's really interesting,
Nicolette. It's great.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.377
Why don't you continue
with the reading?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.624
"Because it was not
Zeus who ordered it...

04:56.755 --> 04:58.965
"...nor Justice,
dweller with the Nether gods,

04:59.049 --> 05:00.466
"gave such a law to men."

05:00.550 --> 05:01.592
Hey.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.843
"Nor did I deem your ordinance

05:02.928 --> 05:04.887
Psst.
"of so much binding force...

05:05.055 --> 05:06.222
"...as that a mortal man
could overbear

05:06.348 --> 05:09.183
"the unchangeable
unwritten code of heaven.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.852
"This is not of today
and yesterday."

05:12.187 --> 05:13.827
That was really nice of you,
waking me up.

05:13.897 --> 05:14.981
Takes a lot of moxie

05:15.065 --> 05:16.524
to fall asleep
in a 12-person class.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.359
Thanks. I like moxie.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.527
I get it.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.778
It's like,
I'm so grateful to be here,

05:20.904 --> 05:22.738
but why are my parents
taking out loans...

05:22.906 --> 05:23.906
...for me to listen

05:24.032 --> 05:25.574
to that 18-year-old
asshole talk?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.785
Loans everywhere.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.204
I was gonna get frozen yogurt,
wanna come?

05:30.372 --> 05:32.248
Yes, but...

05:32.374 --> 05:34.125
Well, I have to get somewhere
by 5:00.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.292
Where?

05:35.419 --> 05:36.544
Uh... It's embarrassing.

05:37.963 --> 05:38.963
What is it?

05:39.131 --> 05:40.881
I'm submitting a story

05:40.966 --> 05:42.299
to the
Mobius Literary Society.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.927
Get out of town, sister!
I already gave mine.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.262
Do you know how
you find out if you're in it?

05:46.430 --> 05:47.470
They said
they post a list.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.848
No, the only people
who check the list

05:48.932 --> 05:50.212
are the people
who didn't get in.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.187
They come and wake us up
at night in our rooms...

05:52.269 --> 05:53.978
...and put pie
in our face

05:54.104 --> 05:56.063
and then bring us
down to the quad...

05:56.231 --> 05:57.940
...and make us sing
and stuff.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.650
Yeah.

06:20.964 --> 06:21.964
Oh, my God!

06:23.759 --> 06:26.343
Am I in?
Oh, my God, really?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.312
Fuck!

06:37.939 --> 06:39.315
They're self-elected
douchebags.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.275
I know. But I wanted
to be one of them.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.485
I could die then.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.528
Yeah, me too.
Both, I want to be in,

06:44.654 --> 06:46.197
and I could also then die.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.115
I heard they serve
wine and cheese

06:48.200 --> 06:50.117
and they all carry briefcases.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.494
I know.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.496
When I had my tour here...

06:53.663 --> 06:54.872
...the guide was
one of them and that's why

06:54.998 --> 06:56.457
I wanted to come here.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.542
I heard the pie stuff
all night.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.461
They got the guy
next door.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.962
He doesn't even
look like a writer.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.469
I'm so sorry.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.971
Do you wanna
trade stories?

07:11.223 --> 07:12.306
Sure.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.558
I'll refresh
our screwdrivers.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.489
I liked it.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.157
Thanks. I liked yours, too.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.742
So, you want notes?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.869
- Oh, are we...
- Sure.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.037
Okay.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.373
I thought the middle part
sounded really fake.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.499
Okay.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.084
It's just my impression.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.378
I'll work on that.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.171
Do you have any
notes for me?

07:44.339 --> 07:45.422
Um...

07:46.550 --> 07:47.550
No.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.717
Great.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.387
I have a car.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.601
Let's go to the beach.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.436
I don't want to leave
Manhattan.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.022
Why are we in your car then?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.586
We look like
we're in a song.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.630
I think the way Aristotle

08:26.756 --> 08:28.116
writes about
ethics and morality...

08:28.258 --> 08:29.258
...is much closer

08:29.342 --> 08:30.759
to how most people
think about it.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.470
Less like math,
more like a story.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.847
I think we should set up
a recycling system

08:34.931 --> 08:36.182
for our trash...

08:36.349 --> 08:37.892
...because a lot of what
we are throwing out

08:37.976 --> 08:39.809
can be recycled.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.022
Ruth, I think that fan
can go in the closet now.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.315
It's 50 degrees out.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.602
You seem happy today.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.444
I love filing.
It's satisfying.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.281
Slow down, T!

08:58.955 --> 08:59.997
Hey.
Hey.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.165
Hey.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.547
No more lonely nights

09:08.632 --> 09:11.759
You my guiding light

09:11.843 --> 09:13.177
This is Stevie Fishko.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.347
I can't come to the phone now.
Please leave me a mess...

09:17.807 --> 09:23.646
May I never miss the thrill

09:23.730 --> 09:28.067
Of being near you

09:30.070 --> 09:31.528
You've reached
Brooke Cardinas.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.988
Leave your name and number

09:33.073 --> 09:36.158
and I will get back to you
at my earliest convenience.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.995
I will do

09:40.080 --> 09:42.748
What I feel

09:42.832 --> 09:46.961
To be right

09:48.380 --> 09:50.464
No more lonely nights

09:50.548 --> 09:52.716
Never be another

09:52.842 --> 09:53.842
No more lonely nights

09:54.719 --> 09:55.761
Hello?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.137
Hi, this is Brooke Cardinas.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.014
I just got a missed call
from this number.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.182
Hi.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.227
Sorry. Um,
this is Tracy Fishko.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.438
My mom is marrying your dad.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.856
You're reading the sonnet!

10:08.024 --> 10:10.150
Right.
We're doing Thanksgiving

10:10.235 --> 10:11.944
and then wedding together.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.195
I go to college in the city

10:13.280 --> 10:14.697
and my mom said
I should call you.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.865
Have you eaten?
Do you want to hang out?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.158
Uh...

10:18.243 --> 10:20.452
No, I haven't. Okay.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.871
Well, do you know
where Times Square is?

10:30.714 --> 10:31.714
Tracy!

10:32.882 --> 10:35.884
Welcome to the
Great White Way!

10:45.228 --> 10:46.228
Times Square
is so crazy!

10:46.313 --> 10:47.313
Isn't it?

10:47.564 --> 10:48.522
I don't know
anyone who lives here.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.648
Yours truly.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.108
I got off the bus from Jersey,

10:51.234 --> 10:52.874
I thought this was
the cool place to live.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.904
It's motherfucking
Times Square!

10:56.072 --> 10:57.152
Why do you live
in New York?

10:57.240 --> 11:00.159
College. I go to Barnard.
It's all women uptown.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.119
Well, "historically"
and kind of actually.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.996
But there are
boys in my classes and stuff.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.289
From Columbia.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.665
You gay?
No.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.114
The Columbia girls do their
best to make us feel inferior,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.003
which it's like,
"I already do."

11:11.171 --> 11:12.755
That's stupid.
Don't feel inferior.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.758
You're right.
That is stupid.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.593
I never went to college.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.386
I'm an autodidact.
Do you know what that means?

11:19.471 --> 11:20.512
Yes.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.931
That word is one of the things
I self-taught myself.

11:32.776 --> 11:37.154
They all love you,
you're a good girl

11:37.280 --> 11:39.198
When you awake
you'll find another man

11:39.282 --> 11:42.284
Lying beside you

11:50.377 --> 11:51.543
What's going on at college?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.753
Everyone's really
excited about

11:52.837 --> 11:54.717
the frozen yogurt machine
in the student center.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.715
I watched my mother die.
What?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.884
I was with my mother
while she died.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.386
I don't know
any dead people.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.763
That's cool about
the frozen yogurt machine.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.473
Everyone I love dies.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.561
Brooke!

12:10.313 --> 12:11.730
I heard you're opening
a restaurant.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.023
Yours truly.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.191
W-T-F?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.819
I know, it uses
all my talents except singing.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.987
I sang with
the band tonight.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.407
This is my
baby sister Tracy.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.908
This bitch
stole my favorite pants.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.159
They're in here somewhere.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.662
She thinks I don't know,
but I know everything.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.205
They're red.
I'll look here.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.165
People are always
taking my shit.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.793
My ex-friend and nemesis,
Mamie-Claire,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.461
stole my ideas and my fiancé.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.546
Shit.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.713
She took this
t-shirt idea that I had,

12:36.840 --> 12:37.965
started a company...

12:38.049 --> 12:39.466
...and fucking sold it
to J. Crew,

12:39.551 --> 12:40.592
so there's that.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.718
She's one of those people that

12:41.845 --> 12:43.262
doesn't have any good ideas
for her own life...

12:43.430 --> 12:45.222
...so she just steals
all of mine.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.182
And then she literally
stole my cats.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.392
What were the t-shirts?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.185
Just really
hard-looking flowers.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.104
Oh, my God! I bought
one of those t-shirts.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.439
Yeah,
flowers with, like,

12:53.523 --> 12:54.857
skulls and shit. Daggers.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.191
That's a great one.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.403
My fiancé,
Dylan, was super sexy.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.571
And so rich.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.072
But I wasn't gonna marry him.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.032
Wait, you broke up with Dylan?
I thought she stole him.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.620
And I never looked back.
He cried so hard, like whiny.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.789
"Where are you going?"

13:11.416 --> 13:12.875
I was being real,

13:12.959 --> 13:14.877
but Mamie-Claire
then goes and marries him.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.295
They live in Greenwich,
Connecticut

13:16.379 --> 13:18.380
in some big gross house.
Do you know that place?

13:18.548 --> 13:19.965
Yeah,
Greenwich, Grossville.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.675
Right?
Living off of his riches

13:21.759 --> 13:23.051
and my t-shirt idea.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.386
I hate them!

13:24.554 --> 13:27.347
I actually pity them.
They have no more dreams.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.432
These?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.726
I wanna marry you!

13:32.395 --> 13:33.437
Ugh!

13:33.563 --> 13:37.733
Must we document ourselves
all the time? Must we?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.402
Is he your boyfriend?
The bassist?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.154
Nate? No!

13:42.322 --> 13:44.948
My beau, Stavros,
is in Greece right now.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.493
Betting against the country
or something gross.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.744
Don't tell anyone that.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.370
I won't.
I'm good at keeping secrets.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.622
You'll learn that about me.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.831
He's the kind of person
I hate,

13:52.916 --> 13:54.249
except I'm in love with him.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.168
I've been to a
Greek Orthodox Easter

13:56.252 --> 13:57.532
and I could
totally see myself...

13:57.587 --> 13:59.963
...getting married in that
kind of church.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.423
You got a honey?

14:01.591 --> 14:02.591
No.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.259
There's this one guy,
we got rejected together,

14:04.344 --> 14:05.469
but he's got a girlfriend.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.262
They all have girlfriends.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.307
Actually, I think he met me
and then he got a girlfriend.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.351
This summer,
at my job, this one guy

14:12.435 --> 14:14.019
just sucked on my boobs
all night.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.021
My restaurant
should do a pierogi.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.814
Fusion pierogi.
You like yours?

14:17.982 --> 14:20.192
Mmm, this is my second dinner.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.444
Just a quick tweet on Twitter.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.447
I'm very into social media.
You have to market yourself.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.698
If you don't know
what you're selling,

14:26.783 --> 14:28.116
no one will know
how to buy it.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.326
What are you selling?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.453
So many things.
I don't tweet all of it.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.456
Like, here are two ideas
that are not on the Internet.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.667
If I did a cabaret...

14:36.834 --> 14:38.168
...it would be called
"High Standards"

14:38.294 --> 14:39.711
and I would sing
all the standards.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.359
Would you sing them
in a higher pitch?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.965
No, it wouldn't be about...

14:43.132 --> 14:44.174
It's about principles,

14:44.300 --> 14:45.634
those kind of
high standards...

14:45.802 --> 14:47.719
...like one of those
"String of Pearls

14:47.804 --> 14:50.389
"and that's why I'm
a single gal" kind of show.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.557
Oh, that's clever.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.101
The second idea
is a television show,

14:54.185 --> 14:56.061
which I've read
is the new novel...

14:56.229 --> 14:57.604
...about a woman

14:57.689 --> 14:59.648
who's a government worker
by day...

14:59.816 --> 15:01.567
...and a self-invented
superhero by night...

15:01.734 --> 15:04.528
...but it's like
the essence of America.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.321
It'll be its own mythology.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.157
I think maybe it'll be called
Mistress America.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.660
That sounds like she's
America's girl on the side.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.078
I don't know, okay?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.414
I'm not positive,
these are just some ideas.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.582
Oh, me, too.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.250
I'm sorry,
I don't know anything,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.043
I was just
throwing something out there.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.425
We need a sleepover party.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.343
This apartment
is technically

15:28.469 --> 15:30.178
zoned commercial,
but that's fake.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.513
It's so stylish.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.681
Fuck, I know,

15:32.807 --> 15:35.642
I freelance
as an interior decorator.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.019
You know the Bowery Hotel?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.353
Oh, my God, yeah.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.023
Well, if you walk
about a block south...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.317
...there's a laser
hair removal center

15:43.401 --> 15:44.568
that's very hip.

15:44.736 --> 15:45.861
I did the waiting room.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.863
That's cool!
I know!

15:48.031 --> 15:50.490
I'm leaving here in January.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.415
Moving to the East Side,
if you can believe it.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.329
That's where Stavros lives.
I'm gonna redo his place too.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.936
I want
to write short stories.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.374
Oh, me too!
Not short stories, though.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.085
But I got rejected
by the Lit Society.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.533
I'm so suggestible, like I think

16:03.588 --> 16:06.048
because I got rejected
I can't be a writer.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.216
Why don't you make
your own Lit Society?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.886
I wish. Mobius
is a big deal at school.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.179
You've got other stories.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.847
Just make another one up.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.391
Maybe I'll write
something else and resubmit.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.853
That was really fun
when we were dancing.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.688
Yeah. I need to cut

16:21.773 --> 16:23.398
all the negative people
out of my life.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.567
I just wasn't
brought up that way.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.694
Thank you, Brooke.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.031
You're welcome, Baby Tracy.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.159
My sweetheart,
I miss you so much!

16:34.327 --> 16:37.496
I can't wait for you to see
the chairs I picked out!

16:37.664 --> 16:42.000
We start renovation so soon!
It's so exciting.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.293
I've been going there

16:43.378 --> 16:46.838
just to sit in the mess.
I love it so much.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.048
Right?

16:48.132 --> 16:52.135
Did you see the lease?
It's like 400 pages.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.262
I wish you could just
come home already...

16:54.430 --> 16:57.849
...so I could suck your dick
in our new restaurant.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.810
Can you start the coffee,
please?

16:59.977 --> 17:00.977
Oh, I don't know how.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.479
Yes, you do.
Don't be incompetent.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.647
If you spent two seconds
with a coffee maker,

17:04.732 --> 17:06.525
you'd figure it out.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.068
Hi. No, I'm here.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.444
Where are you going?

17:09.612 --> 17:12.196
Duh! Communal bathroom.
Do you wanna watch?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.281
It's some girl.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.991
Sorry, are you mad at me?
No!

17:16.202 --> 17:18.369
We have four investors,
including me.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.579
I'm what you call
a principal investor.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.374
Stavros
is putting in my share...

17:22.541 --> 17:24.960
...but I insisted that it be
my assets on the line...

17:25.127 --> 17:27.671
...because I want him to know
I have skin in the game.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.923
I'll pay him back, of course,
once we start making a profit.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.550
We never went to
restaurants growing up.

17:31.634 --> 17:32.759
It wasn't part of our lives.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.428
That's a shitty thing
to say to me.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.472
I didn't mean... I know
people will come to yours.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.682
It's so weird to think

17:38.766 --> 17:40.517
that every restaurant
I see is the result...

17:40.685 --> 17:42.018
...of a person going,

17:42.103 --> 17:43.729
"I think I want
to start a restaurant."

17:43.938 --> 17:46.440
No, that's not weird.
That's everything.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.316
What are you...
What are you doing?

17:49.485 --> 17:52.904
Actually... I'm writing down
what I said...

17:53.072 --> 17:54.322
You're noting yourself?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.991
Yeah, I guess so.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.242
I've noticed something
about myself

17:57.326 --> 17:59.046
that would make
a good character in a story.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.162
Oh, yeah?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.329
Yeah.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.167
But I'm gonna save it
in case I want to use it

18:05.251 --> 18:07.335
in something that I write.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.424
High five, sister.
That was an amazing night.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.176
Yeah, it was.
Best of my life.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.761
I gotta go.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.023
What did she say?

18:28.858 --> 18:33.779
"He's one of those people
that I hate...

18:35.031 --> 18:39.785
"...except that
I'm in love with him."

18:39.952 --> 18:41.661
Shut up, please.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.543
Meadow DeRiggi lived

18:48.669 --> 18:50.796
exactly how a young woman
should live...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.881
...who wants to spend
her youth well.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.716
She did everything
and nothing...

18:54.884 --> 18:55.884
...and spent time

18:56.010 --> 18:58.136
like I always mean to:
purposefully.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.223
She sang with the band
and knew everyone

19:01.307 --> 19:02.891
and didn't owe
anyone anything.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.685
And couldn't pay up,
even if she did.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.729
Her beauty
was that rare kind...

19:07.897 --> 19:09.648
...that made you want to look
more like yourself

19:09.732 --> 19:11.358
and not like her.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.325
Being around Meadow

19:20.409 --> 19:22.035
was like being
in New York City.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.413
It made you want to find life,
not hide from it.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.209
Brooke!

19:29.418 --> 19:30.502
Oh...

19:30.586 --> 19:31.753
It's okay.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.381
Where were you last night?
Did you get my text?

19:34.549 --> 19:35.674
You text her?
You texted her?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.008
About work.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.260
I went to check out
this downtown band

19:38.386 --> 19:39.594
at this downtown bar.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.887
Who were you with?
Myself.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.681
When you said you were
checking out the scores,

19:42.765 --> 19:44.850
were you texting her?
Are you sexting?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.393
It was this place
my sister showed me.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.519
You don't have a sister.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.730
I do. Or I will, when my mom
gets married at Thanksgiving.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.025
Why don't you just text her
a picture of your balls?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.193
Nicolette!

19:56.946 --> 19:57.946
What's that?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.234
It's this new story I wrote.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.574
I'm gonna resubmit
to the Lit Society.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.617
Wait, you wrote
another one already?

20:02.785 --> 20:04.828
You printed it on onionskin?
You can read it if you want.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.580
I have an extra copy.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.874
Okay. I'd... totally
give you notes.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.041
No, I don't want notes.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.126
But I thought about it

20:11.210 --> 20:12.419
and I actually do have
notes for you.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.462
Uh, sure.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.966
You write like
you're imitating someone

20:18.050 --> 20:19.718
who is free and wild...

20:20.386 --> 20:23.722
...and it is so weird,
because you aren't at all...

20:23.973 --> 20:25.473
...and it made me
uncomfortable.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.392
And I think it would make
everyone uncomfortable.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.811
And, also,
stop trying to be funny,

20:29.937 --> 20:31.438
because you're not funny.

20:31.814 --> 20:32.814
And...

20:33.399 --> 20:35.400
...it just adds
to the awkwardness.

20:35.818 --> 20:39.487
Oh, and it could also be,
like, 30% shorter, easy.

20:39.989 --> 20:40.989
Okay.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.657
Thanks.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.099
Hey, Baby Tracy!

21:11.520 --> 21:13.813
This is all about you,
right now.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.857
And you're giving it
as much as you've got,

21:15.983 --> 21:17.025
so reach inside you...

21:17.193 --> 21:19.194
...and whatever it is
inside of you,

21:19.320 --> 21:20.946
you put it on the bike.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.697
You feel me?

21:22.865 --> 21:25.200
How you do anything
is how you do everything,

21:25.326 --> 21:27.535
so leave it on the floor.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.703
You did great.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.372
I feel like I just went
swimming in my clothes.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.207
I'm glad you came.
You are?

21:32.375 --> 21:34.709
Shit, I've gotta change,
I've got a meeting.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.127
Thanks, Brooke!

21:36.295 --> 21:37.545
You're welcome, honey!

21:59.735 --> 22:02.070
God, I am packed
into this pencil skirt.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.196
How do I look?

22:03.364 --> 22:04.572
You look beautiful.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.820
But do I look professional?

22:05.866 --> 22:07.426
I get really nervous
with the investors.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.577
I'm usually fine
with wealthy people,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.302
it's just when
I need something from them.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.497
No, it's the opposite.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.499
They need you
and your restaurant.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.543
Stavros usually
does this stuff.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.586
Maybe I shouldn't do it.
I'm not good at it.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.172
I think you can do anything.
Everything.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.590
Right.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.260
Kind and fearless.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.700
It's amazing
how much of business

22:48.784 --> 22:50.910
is just stating the same thing
over and over again.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.878
Your body language
looked very self-confident.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.123
Thanks. You make me feel
really smart.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.374
Do you wanna see it?

22:56.542 --> 22:57.584
Yeah!

23:05.176 --> 23:08.178
The front part would be like
a shop during the day...

23:08.345 --> 23:09.554
...like a general store

23:09.638 --> 23:12.640
or a really nice bodega,
candy from Europe.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.186
On Monday, we start demo,
and we open in April.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.438
We'd also have
cooking classes.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.814
Maybe cut hair.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.859
It would be like
a community center...

23:23.027 --> 23:25.653
...and restaurant
and a store all in one.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.157
It would be the place
that you, like, loved to be.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.867
I wish I had something
like that growing up.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.327
Yeah, suburban New Jersey

23:32.453 --> 23:34.120
isn't great
with this kind of stuff.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.165
Each plate would be different.
Here, let me show you.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.374
Can I be a waitress here?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.335
See? Look at
all these plates.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.003
Holy shit,
you have a lot of plates.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.130
I started collecting them
so long ago,

23:44.215 --> 23:46.382
I didn't know why
and now I have a why.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.259
This is going to be
a great restaurant.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.385
I know!

23:49.512 --> 23:50.845
Are you going
to cook, too?

23:51.013 --> 23:53.681
I'll help create the menu
and I'll pitch in when needed.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.808
I'm not trained,

23:54.850 --> 23:56.851
but I'm an enthusiastic
home cook.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.645
I always used to cook
with my mom.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.064
That's the name
of the restaurant, Mom's.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.190
Possessive.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.733
"Let's go to Mom's
for dinner."

24:03.859 --> 24:05.819
Yeah, it totally works.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.028
Can I be a waitress here?

24:07.154 --> 24:08.154
I want the whole deal.

24:08.239 --> 24:12.033
I want the dead-on-my-feet-
wake-up-and-I'm-40.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.868
I've spent my whole life

24:13.994 --> 24:17.038
chasing after things
and knocking at doors...

24:17.206 --> 24:20.583
...and I'm tired
of running towards people.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.961
I want to be the place
that people come to.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.337
I want to make a home

24:24.421 --> 24:26.381
for all the knockers
and runners.

24:26.549 --> 24:30.385
I'm good at that.
I'm happy with that.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.471
I keep the hearth.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.851
That's a word, right? Hearth?

24:38.853 --> 24:39.853
I tutor junior high

24:39.937 --> 24:41.396
because I didn't get
high enough SAT scores

24:41.522 --> 24:42.730
to do SAT tutoring...

24:42.898 --> 24:45.400
...but you make
way more money doing SAT's.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.068
So, I'm gonna take
the SAT's again

24:47.194 --> 24:48.714
so I can make inroads
into that racket.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.655
I've always been
a really good test taker.

24:50.865 --> 24:54.075
None of this will be necessary
when I'm a restaurateur.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.744
But I'm good that way,
curating my employment.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.746
So, um,
should I wait here, or...

24:58.914 --> 25:00.594
Oh, I thought
you had to go back to school.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.208
Right. I should.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.585
Do you want to stay?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.545
I mean, if you don't mind.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.213
I'd invite you in,
but Peggy's mom

25:07.298 --> 25:08.381
just got institutionalized...

25:08.465 --> 25:09.841
...for bipolar disorder,

25:09.925 --> 25:11.718
so shit's pretty
real upstairs.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.262
Tutoring is like
60% middle school math...

25:14.430 --> 25:16.472
...40% I know too much
about them.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.474
That's okay, then.
I'll just go home.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.018
You remember
where my apartment is,

25:20.102 --> 25:21.603
go there. Bring my shit.

25:21.770 --> 25:22.937
Seriously?

25:23.105 --> 25:24.606
Pick up some pasta, I'll cook.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.441
What kind of...

25:33.616 --> 25:36.117
Mom? Hey, are you there?

25:36.827 --> 25:37.827
Shit.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.496
I just wanted to know

25:40.623 --> 25:42.957
what kind of pasta
you'd buy...

25:43.125 --> 25:45.084
...if you wanted to buy
a nice pasta.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.461
Like, the brand?

25:46.629 --> 25:49.797
If you get this, can you
call me back right away?

25:50.925 --> 25:52.842
This one is like bowties.
Get that?

25:53.010 --> 25:54.344
Do they have
regular spaghetti?

25:54.511 --> 25:57.138
Is that pasta
the same way as the others?

25:57.306 --> 25:58.681
Is this some sex game?

25:58.807 --> 26:00.016
No, we're actually
talking about pasta.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.684
Hello!
Yes.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.492
Why don't you just put pasta
up her pussy?

26:03.520 --> 26:05.313
Nicolette, seriously!

26:06.523 --> 26:09.025
I remember
once enjoying a rigatoni dish.

26:09.193 --> 26:13.780
So, I'll get that
and I'll get the bowties.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.324
And there's shells.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.853
I remember
looking across the river...

26:46.021 --> 26:48.856
...at the unblinking lights
of Manhattan buildings.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.025
Wondering who lived there.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.362
X can be anything, any number,
that's what's crazy about X.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.030
I just wanted
to enter those spaces

26:56.156 --> 26:57.865
and crawl up on the floor
and go to sleep.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.368
X doesn't roll like that,
X can't be pinned down!

27:00.536 --> 27:01.869
I was part of it now.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.371
On the fifth floor,

27:03.497 --> 27:05.498
in a temporary
commercial apartment.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.710
There was our castle,
our fortress.

27:11.839 --> 27:12.922
But outside the windows,

27:13.048 --> 27:14.768
I could hear the hot sound
of jackhammers...

27:14.842 --> 27:16.592
...taking the city apart.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.554
In New York,
neighborhoods change

27:19.680 --> 27:21.014
as quickly as the weather.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.850
Or maybe
it's the other way around.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.102
But I couldn't warn Meadow.

27:26.437 --> 27:29.897
By the time I noticed it,
it was already too late.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.901
Nate dropped
a gram on Instagram.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.069
That means a picture.

27:35.237 --> 27:37.238
It looks like a really
stylish breath mint ad.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.615
I know!
Dave's a real shutterbug.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.908
He made his own app.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.036
Did these two drinks
earn me another free hot dog?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.371
I would love
to get into the app business.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.874
I think my dad met your mom
on the Internet.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.000
Yeah,
on a free dating website.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.084
They didn't even pay.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.420
Gross. But also I guess
it's pro forma now?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.756
My dad's so strange.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.425
I'm sure he's making her
convert to Catholicism.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.052
Yeah, what's that about?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.595
He's real Catholic now.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.055
It's so boring,
but it happened

28:02.139 --> 28:03.598
when my mom got sick.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.601
She was never that into it.
He's a geologist.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.270
I know. I'd never met
a geologist before.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.731
It's weird that someone
who studies rocks

28:11.815 --> 28:13.941
can be really into Jesus.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.485
What did your mom do?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.779
She was a special education
teacher.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.280
That's so nice.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.488
She was really good at it.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.450
I still don't like
retarded jokes.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.452
Do you want to see
a picture of her?

28:27.581 --> 28:28.748
She doesn't look like you,

28:28.832 --> 28:31.959
but she has your expression,
you know?

28:33.962 --> 28:34.962
Hi.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.131
Hello.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.217
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me,

28:39.301 --> 28:40.843
we went to
high school together.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.136
Anna Wheeler?

28:42.262 --> 28:43.596
Oh, yeah!

28:43.764 --> 28:45.306
I was in the chorus
of Anything Goes?

28:45.474 --> 28:46.808
Holy shit, yeah!

28:46.975 --> 28:47.975
What are you
doing in the city?

28:48.102 --> 28:49.143
Do you live here?

28:49.269 --> 28:50.478
No, I'm in Tenafly.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.771
My fiancé and I just went
to see a show.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.439
Which one?
Other Desert Cities.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.607
Oh, that's a piece of shit.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.818
And the girl who
replaced the lead is awful.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.571
I used to run around with her.
Well, she was older, is older.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.697
We loved it.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.533
What are you guys drinking?
Let me buy you a drink.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.700
You know, that's okay.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.494
I just wanted
to tell you because...

29:06.662 --> 29:07.912
...I never
had the courage to do it

29:07.996 --> 29:09.205
when I was actually
in high school:

29:09.373 --> 29:11.332
You really hurt my feelings.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.376
What?

29:15.504 --> 29:17.046
You don't remember?

29:18.132 --> 29:19.549
What did I do?

29:19.716 --> 29:22.385
That thing? "Yep, bitter."

29:22.553 --> 29:24.929
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

29:25.013 --> 29:26.180
I always liked you.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.141
You and your friend Abe?
Abe!

29:28.308 --> 29:29.468
You guys
used to do this thing

29:29.518 --> 29:30.560
where you would
walk up to me...

29:30.727 --> 29:32.687
touch my skin
and then like taste it

29:32.813 --> 29:34.253
and think for a minute,
and then say:

29:34.356 --> 29:36.983
"Yep, bitter." And then laugh.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.526
Right!
We did do that, didn't we?

29:38.652 --> 29:39.652
We were weird.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.738
I was standing right there,
every single time you did it.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.240
It was really mean.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.867
And I just wanted to say
fuck you.

29:45.993 --> 29:46.993
Whoa! Whoa.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.494
The way you treated me

29:48.579 --> 29:49.996
really messed me up
for a long time.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.831
Everyone is an asshole
in high school!

29:51.999 --> 29:53.875
You made a lot of people
feel bad, not just me.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.126
I feel sorry
for the 13-year-old girl

29:55.210 --> 29:56.294
that was you...

29:56.462 --> 29:57.962
...but I don't feel sorry
for you now.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.046
We were 17.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.798
If I was 13,
I'd apologize to you,

30:00.883 --> 30:02.083
but seeing
as both of us are...

30:02.217 --> 30:04.385
...in our 20s,
I don't feel the need.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.636
I just turned 30.
Happy Birthday.

30:05.721 --> 30:06.721
Thank you.
You're welcome.

30:06.889 --> 30:07.972
You're a bitch.
Why?

30:08.140 --> 30:09.891
You're the one
that hung onto this grudge

30:09.975 --> 30:11.017
for so fucking long!

30:11.185 --> 30:13.186
I didn't even recognize you
when you walked up.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.980
I don't say that to be mean,
that's the way it should be.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.232
You're the same.
Malevolent.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.400
You were bitter.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.651
That's probably why
it hurt so much.

30:20.736 --> 30:21.819
Because it was true.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.572
I wish all bad things on you.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.574
I don't on you
because I don't care.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.078
And neither should you!

30:37.377 --> 30:39.754
That was so dramatic!
What a drama queen.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.340
I can't believe she lives
in fucking Tenafly.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.758
What is she, rich now?

30:43.926 --> 30:45.927
How dare she talk to me
that way and be rich?

30:46.094 --> 30:48.095
In junior high,
this girl Tara Podwoski

30:48.222 --> 30:50.062
used to pull my hair
and call me a cunt hunter.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.599
I didn't do
what that girl said.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.003
I just wasn't
brought up that way.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.603
I should call Abe
and see if he remembers.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.104
Maybe do it later?
Yeah.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.024
I was so popular
in high school,

31:00.108 --> 31:01.234
but I didn't even try.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.361
People just wanted
to be friends with me.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.779
I didn't care
about that stuff.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.948
When someone told me
I was popular,

31:07.032 --> 31:08.533
I was like, "Really? Weird."

31:08.700 --> 31:09.867
That's why you were popular.

31:09.952 --> 31:11.953
Popular kids never care.
I cared too much.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.871
Like if you want to know all
the popular kids' business,

31:13.956 --> 31:15.206
ask an unpopular kid.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.541
They're the ones
who know everything,

31:16.625 --> 31:18.545
'cause they're the ones
who really pay attention.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.378
I'm gonna shorten that,
punch it up,

31:20.462 --> 31:22.421
and turn it into a tweet.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.883
Oh, no! Did I feed you
too much liquor?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.094
It's okay.
I'll be okay.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.804
Let's get you a cab.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.973
Would it be okay
if I slept over again?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.726
I'm pretty sure
college is supposed to be

31:35.811 --> 31:36.894
more fun than I'm having.

31:36.979 --> 31:37.979
Damn it.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.772
I'm kind of attractive.
Ugh.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.906
I might be up for another
drink. Is that crazy?

31:42.985 --> 31:44.819
Goddamn it!
What?

31:44.987 --> 31:46.237
Fuck me!

31:46.405 --> 31:47.572
What's happening?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.740
I fucking
don't believe this shit!

31:49.825 --> 31:52.159
Motherfucking shit!

31:53.412 --> 31:55.913
The goddamn locks are changed!

32:02.170 --> 32:05.172
Hey, Kareem,
can we use your fire escape?

32:05.841 --> 32:06.841
Yep.

32:11.847 --> 32:15.308
Shit! I thought I left
this window open!

32:15.475 --> 32:17.101
I might have closed it.

32:17.811 --> 32:18.811
Why?

32:19.104 --> 32:21.480
I didn't want you
to get robbed.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.692
I can't believe
you fucking changed my locks!

32:25.360 --> 32:28.487
Stavros saw a picture of her
kissing a musician.

32:29.031 --> 32:31.282
Stavros is
her boyfriend.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.036
He told the super

32:35.120 --> 32:37.371
that Brooke was living
in a commercial space.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.540
Is your place
zoned commercial?

32:39.708 --> 32:40.708
Yeah.

32:41.543 --> 32:42.710
I hope he doesn't
rat on you.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.216
He's pulling out
of the restaurant.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.054
I hope Stavros
doesn't rat out Kareem.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.056
My partners are gonna bail.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.557
They were only in
because Stavros was in.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.559
They can go after my savings,
everything.

32:58.727 --> 32:59.810
Oh, God.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.018
Rich people will take any
excuse not to spend money.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.481
You can just
see it in their eyes.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.940
They don't really
want to share life with you.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.443
Rich people always give out
bad Halloween candy.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.613
The contractors need another
$20,000 by Monday.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.240
And the key fee payment,
that's $50,000... Oh, shit!

33:13.408 --> 33:16.077
The refrigeration,
that's another $5,000!

33:16.161 --> 33:17.787
I need whatever that equals
by Monday.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.080
That's $75,000.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.289
Oh, my fucking God!

33:20.457 --> 33:22.500
Isn't there someone else
you can ask to invest?

33:22.668 --> 33:24.460
I already hit up
every rich person I knew

33:24.586 --> 33:25.586
the first time around.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.922
This was
well-thought through, Tracy.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.507
I don't know,
it's such a good investment.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.133
I'd put money in
if I had it.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.426
Do you secretly have money?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.136
No, my mom never worked

33:34.262 --> 33:36.347
and my dad was always
kind of mad at her for that.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.016
But my parents' divorce
was way easier than this.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.434
That's because they stopped

33:40.519 --> 33:42.144
caring about life
just entirely.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.688
That's not the same thing.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.941
My mom died, so don't even
start with me about your pain.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.275
My uncle died.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.485
Shut up, Ruth.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.614
I need some answers.
I'm coming.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.784
I'm gonna be worse off now

33:56.868 --> 33:59.787
than I was before I started
trying to achieve stuff.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.289
I know what it is
to want things.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.291
No, you don't.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.461
You can't really know
what it is to want things

34:07.546 --> 34:09.338
until you're at least 30.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.550
And then,
with each passing year,

34:12.634 --> 34:13.842
it gets bigger...

34:14.010 --> 34:18.139
...because the want is more
and the possibility is less.

34:18.306 --> 34:22.143
Like how each passing year
of your life seems faster...

34:22.310 --> 34:23.590
...because
it's a smaller portion

34:23.645 --> 34:25.478
of your total life.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.023
Like that. But in reverse.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.652
Everything becomes pure want.

34:32.154 --> 34:35.364
Okay,
Brooke, I'm ready.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.121
Spirit says
you have to seek out

34:43.206 --> 34:44.581
an old friend.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.833
Who?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.170
Somebody who hurt you.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.920
Just tell me exactly
what to do.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.176
Spirit says something about...

34:56.719 --> 34:57.720
...fabric?

34:59.055 --> 35:01.557
It's your friend Mamie-Claire.
The fabric is the t-shirts.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.602
Yes. And I see flowers.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.020
Hard-looking
flowers.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.230
Please, Tracy!

35:09.065 --> 35:10.691
Mamie-Claire is my enemy.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.194
You have unfinished business
with this woman.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.863
No, no, no, no. It's finished.
Tell Spirit it's finished.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.281
What happened
with Mamie-Claire?

35:17.449 --> 35:18.616
She totally
screwed Brooke over.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.451
She married her fiancé
and stole her idea.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.286
I never looked back.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.413
Yeah, I'm seeing this. But...

35:24.581 --> 35:25.915
Oh, I'm seeing trees.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.333
You said
she lives in Connecticut.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.959
There are trees
in Connecticut.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.544
Well, to be fair,
there are trees

35:30.629 --> 35:31.712
pretty much everywhere.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.047
You have
to listen to Spirit.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.615
Mamie-Claire
can give you the money.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.217
Hi-ho Greenwich!

35:36.384 --> 35:39.178
Really? Can we
get some confirmation?

35:39.262 --> 35:40.888
Is Spirit sure of this?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.932
Yeah. Look,
the young one is right.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.141
She's not that young!

35:44.226 --> 35:45.726
Ten, ten to twelve
years younger.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.561
We're contemporaries, okay?

35:47.729 --> 35:51.565
You must seek out
this Mamie-Claire.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.901
I'm so
annoyed by Spirit.

35:54.069 --> 35:58.239
The path isn't against you.
It's just the path.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.574
Right. I don't
wanna be petty.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.827
I just wasn't
brought up that way.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.914
She's my nemesis,
but she does owe me.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.457
This has been heavy on you.

36:08.625 --> 36:12.044
And sometimes
you have to go back...

36:12.128 --> 36:13.587
in order to go front.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.674
Fuck this parade.
I'm going to Greenwich.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.259
We're going.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.594
You ready for this, squirt?
It's gonna get ugly.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.263
I'm ready.
Great.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.514
How do we get there?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.099
I really don't like
to leave the city.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.935
You're gonna want to take
the Hutch to the Merritt.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.020
I'll bet Dylan
is still in love with me.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.064
Marrying Mamie-Claire
is like buying

36:32.148 --> 36:33.983
a cashmere sweater
from Old Navy.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.910
Even if he's not,
this is a great investment.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.529
And don't forget,
she still owes you.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.905
Yeah, it's win-win.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.615
Because I'm sure
he still loves me.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.103
I'm not driving you
to Connecticut

36:43.159 --> 36:44.201
to break up a marriage.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.871
I should be in my room
reading Nicomachean Ethics.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.998
Oh, calm down, rich boy.
I'm not rich!

36:49.165 --> 36:50.666
Yes, you are.
You have a car.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.210
No, I'm not.
My dad is a mechanic.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.629
He and my uncle
have a body shop.

36:55.797 --> 36:58.632
I have this car because it was
something he could give me.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.885
Sorry. I think I offended
your boyfriend.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.372
He's not her boyfriend.
He's mine.

37:02.512 --> 37:03.512
Why are you here?

37:03.638 --> 37:04.638
Because Tracy
made Tony drive you.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.181
But why did you come?

37:06.349 --> 37:08.392
I had a bad experience
with adultery before.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
My last boyfriend

37:09.644 --> 37:10.853
committed adultery
when we were together...

37:11.021 --> 37:12.897
and I just don't like to let
my boyfriends get too far.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.441
Adultery? Why the fuck
does it matter?

37:15.525 --> 37:16.650
You're all 18.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.737
Where is this old person
morality coming from?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.364
There's no cheating
when you're 18.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.326
You should all be touching
each other all the time.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.415
Do you ever get that feeling
when you're on a car trip...

37:31.583 --> 37:33.876
...that you never want to get
where you're going?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.086
That you never want it to end?

37:45.180 --> 37:46.305
Nicolette!

37:46.389 --> 37:48.349
You fuckin'
scared the shit out of me!

37:49.351 --> 37:51.518
Sweetie, I... It feels nice.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.855
I mean, I'm driving, I can't...
I can't right now.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.909
You should be with him,
not that goth housewife.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.786
No. He knew me
and he chose her.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.162
Only because you let him.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.872
You have to chase down
the things that you want.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.208
I was just gonna
let it go.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.043
Sometimes I don't know
if you're a Zen master

38:16.127 --> 38:17.544
or a sociopath.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.129
I'm just normal.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.299
Can you stay on the neck?

38:22.467 --> 38:23.592
Like that?

38:23.802 --> 38:26.387
I'll give him a backrub
he won't soon forget.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.889
See, you don't
give a shit, do you?

38:29.724 --> 38:31.642
I'm so glad
you're on my team.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.145
The very things
that had worked

38:35.230 --> 38:37.398
so well for Meadow,
up until then...

38:37.565 --> 38:39.775
...had started
turning and fading.

38:39.943 --> 38:42.111
She had no other skills,

38:42.237 --> 38:44.154
no other way
of dealing with the world.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.949
In one instant her behaviors
turned from charming

38:47.075 --> 38:49.326
to borderline hysteric.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.996
People could feel
her failure coming.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.748
She smelled
of something rotten.

38:54.916 --> 38:55.916
Her youth had died

38:55.959 --> 38:58.502
and she was dragging around
the decaying carcass.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.130
I had somehow
become the pallbearer.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.674
I'm trying to find
Mamie-Claire's address.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.592
Does she have
a different last name?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.960
I have a visual memory of it.
It's kind of photographic.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.179
Oh, you've been here?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.265
Well,
I kind of stalked them once.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.100
I was so pissed.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.647
Yep. This is it.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.067
Oh, we're all going?

39:22.152 --> 39:24.695
Okay, we look crazy,
but maybe that's good.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.204
Can I help you?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.708
Hi, yes, I was wondering,
is Mamie-Claire or Dylan in?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.710
I'm an old friend.
Wrong house.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.962
Oh.
Which is their house?

39:42.130 --> 39:43.797
I don't come here,
I live in New York.

39:45.467 --> 39:46.967
I'll take you there.

39:51.639 --> 39:52.848
You guys just wait there.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.734
Harold?

40:03.818 --> 40:04.860
What do you think
I was doing last night?

40:05.028 --> 40:06.528
I don't know, Harold.
Watching kiddie porn?

40:06.696 --> 40:08.572
I was listening
to you and your husband shout,

40:08.656 --> 40:09.740
and I was not sleeping.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.909
So sorry we interrupted
your kiddie porn.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.160
I'm a pediatrician.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.411
Obviously.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.038
Next time I hear
decibel levels like that,

40:16.164 --> 40:17.498
I'm calling the cops.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.541
That is a promise.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.168
This is the house.

40:21.211 --> 40:22.252
Hello!

40:22.337 --> 40:25.172
What are you doing here?
Who are these people?

40:25.340 --> 40:27.007
Tracy's mom
is marrying my dad,

40:27.092 --> 40:28.425
Tony drove,
Nicolette is jealous.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.511
Hi, I'm Tracy.
Hi, Mamie-Claire.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.054
Nicolette.
Mamie-Claire.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.347
I'm Tony.

40:33.515 --> 40:34.835
Wait, don't tell me,
Mamie-Claire.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.351
I thought we weren't speaking.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.519
Right, I want to change that.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.229
And I have something
that I really need

40:40.355 --> 40:41.555
to talk to you
and Dylan about.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.023
Dylan's not here.
Where is he?

40:43.191 --> 40:45.275
He volunteers
at a retirement community.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.693
I'm in the middle of something

40:46.778 --> 40:48.695
that's this thing we do.
It's like a party.

40:48.863 --> 40:49.863
That's okay.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.448
It's not for you
to say okay...

40:51.616 --> 40:52.783
...it's for me to say okay.

40:52.951 --> 40:53.951
We'll wait in the car.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.077
No, that's weird.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.578
People wait in cars.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.123
You and your posse
can hang out in the kitchen.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.290
Great!

41:04.045 --> 41:05.379
Faulkner uses language

41:05.463 --> 41:08.549
the way the Modernist painters
were using paint.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.301
Exploring the reality
of words,

41:11.386 --> 41:12.970
or paint itself.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.889
Only Faulkner was interested
in how this happens...

41:16.057 --> 41:17.558
...while his characters

41:17.642 --> 41:18.725
are actually
trying to communicate.

41:18.893 --> 41:19.977
Holy shit,
these pregnant women

41:20.061 --> 41:21.395
are super smart.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.147
I don't know if you're hungry,

41:23.231 --> 41:24.731
but this is for
if you're hungry.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.059
This place is amazing.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.151
Thank you.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.402
It's really fucking nice.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.611
Thank you.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.823
Would it be okay if we
sat in on your discussion?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.908
Uh, yeah, I guess.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.077
This week's book
is Faulkner's The Hamlet.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.912
Followed by
a kind of junky biography

41:38.997 --> 41:40.414
of Derrida, but it's fun.

41:40.582 --> 41:41.790
- Tight.
- Awesome.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.292
Look at this.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.837
Apparently, she got recruited
by Tufts for crew...

41:47.005 --> 41:48.839
...and then went
but never did it.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.966
I mean, that's the kind
of person she is,

41:51.092 --> 41:52.509
just sly and shitty.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.262
I would do that if I could.
I wasn't good at sports.

41:55.430 --> 41:56.513
Yeah, I would too,

41:56.598 --> 41:57.681
but it wouldn't be
like my character.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.349
It would just be
something I did.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.476
When does that
become the same thing?

42:01.644 --> 42:03.145
I don't know.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.148
You look amazing.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.524
Why are all these
kids with you?

42:07.692 --> 42:09.484
They aren't kids.
If they're kids, we are.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.445
I'm an associate
and her almost-sister.

42:11.613 --> 42:12.779
I really need
to talk to you.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.531
Okay, how long do you think
you'll need with me, because...

42:14.616 --> 42:15.699
How long do you think
Dylan will be giving back

42:15.783 --> 42:16.867
at the old folks' home?

42:16.951 --> 42:18.151
I'd also like
to talk with him.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.286
We're both very busy.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.495
I have an
appointment after this.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.039
Oh, come on,
Mamie-Claire, that's stupid.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.041
You aren't really busy.
Yes, I am!

42:24.209 --> 42:25.334
Remember this truth,

42:25.460 --> 42:27.211
it is only people
who don't have jobs...

42:27.378 --> 42:28.503
...and don't have
anything to do,

42:28.630 --> 42:30.505
that are always fucking busy.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.840
Like, what are you doing?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.688
We started a community farm.
We have goats.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.719
Goats are more sustainable.
They're smaller.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.262
Than what?
Cows.

42:37.347 --> 42:38.388
Mamie-Claire?
People are leaving.

42:38.473 --> 42:39.598
Excuse me,
I have to see my guests out.

42:39.682 --> 42:40.766
I want to say
goodbye to Marcy.

42:40.850 --> 42:41.892
Do you have a crush
on Marcy now?

42:41.976 --> 42:43.310
She's seven months pregnant.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.728
Why do you know that?

42:46.064 --> 42:47.147
Bye, Marcy.

42:47.315 --> 42:48.315
Bye, Tony.

42:48.483 --> 42:49.483
See you guys.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.401
Mamie-Claire,
can me and Nicolette

42:51.486 --> 42:53.362
- play with your chess set?
- Yes.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.488
Bye, Tony.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.572
Bye, Nadia.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.159
Everything okay, Karen?

42:59.327 --> 43:00.953
Yes, I'm just waiting
for my husband.

43:01.037 --> 43:02.663
He's late to pick me up.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.030
You want to play
chess with us?

43:04.082 --> 43:05.207
You have to teach me!

43:05.375 --> 43:06.375
No, he'll be here any minute.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.752
Sorry, I got started
on the wrong foot there.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.545
I meant to say
I've been missing you

43:10.672 --> 43:11.880
as a friend and...

43:12.048 --> 43:14.128
She has a very exciting
business opportunity for you.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.775
And I wanted to bring it to
you and Dylan

43:15.843 --> 43:16.843
as a peace offering.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.679
I really think you're gonna
want to hear about this.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.305
The last time I saw you,
you were hiding in the bushes.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.473
And then you
started incoherently

43:21.557 --> 43:22.641
yelling at me
and my husband...

43:22.725 --> 43:24.184
...about how
we had ruined your life.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.394
And the time before that,

43:25.520 --> 43:26.687
you were throwing up
at my wedding.

43:26.854 --> 43:27.938
Which is why I'm bringing you

43:28.022 --> 43:29.731
this exciting
business opportunity!

43:29.899 --> 43:30.979
When did you
take my bishop?

43:31.109 --> 43:32.442
I would like to offer you
a share

43:32.527 --> 43:33.527
in a restaurant I'm starting.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.611
Why?

43:34.737 --> 43:36.905
Because it's all set up
and ready to go.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.032
And I already have an ability
to draw a crowd,

43:39.117 --> 43:41.201
and it's just
gonna be perfect!

43:41.369 --> 43:42.577
You'll love it. So will Dylan.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.065
There are
lots of other investors.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.581
But not so many that it would
dilute your investment.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.125
So why are you here?

43:48.293 --> 43:50.585
Well, there was a slight snafu
with one of our people...

43:50.753 --> 43:52.796
...which allowed a very
coveted spot to open up,

43:52.880 --> 43:54.089
which I'm offering
only to you guys.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.299
It's not really
a good time for me

43:55.383 --> 43:56.466
to get involved with business.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.093
Why?
I'm trying to have a baby.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.261
You'll never regret it.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.345
Thank you, Karen.

44:00.471 --> 44:01.555
It's just money.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.079
You don't
have to do any of the work.

44:03.224 --> 44:04.641
You get the glory,
and the profit...

44:04.726 --> 44:05.726
...and the satisfaction

44:05.810 --> 44:06.810
of being involved
with something awesome.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.395
I don't think
Dylan will buy into it.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.479
We recently lost money

44:09.564 --> 44:10.764
purchasing taxi cab
medallions.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.607
I don't mean
to overstep my bounds here,

44:12.734 --> 44:13.942
but I think
that you might be wrong.

44:14.110 --> 44:15.110
When is he coming back?

44:15.278 --> 44:16.611
I really need to focus
on having children.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.572
This is not part of
what I need to focus on.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.490
No. Just...
Can I just say no?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.492
No, you cannot
"just say no." Why not?

44:22.660 --> 44:23.994
I don't need a why.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.954
This money
would mean nothing to you.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.956
Look at all this shit,
this house,

44:28.082 --> 44:29.249
that patio furniture.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.293
You could spare it,
you wouldn't even miss it.

44:31.461 --> 44:32.919
And it really
would make a profit.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.463
No. You can't make me.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.798
Yes, I can because you owe me!

44:36.966 --> 44:38.008
Um, Brooke...

44:38.176 --> 44:39.259
I don't owe you.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.595
For Dylan,
because that was just skanky.

44:41.763 --> 44:43.347
But really for the t-shirts.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.766
You stole my t-shirt idea
and you know it.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.017
I did not steal your idea.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.643
It was my idea and you
were there when I had it.

44:48.770 --> 44:49.811
No!

44:49.937 --> 44:51.271
That is so wrong.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.273
I remember it
like the minute I said,

44:53.441 --> 44:54.858
"What if these flowers were,
like, tough?"

44:55.026 --> 44:56.401
And then we started
riffing about it.

44:56.486 --> 44:57.486
But I said it first!

44:57.612 --> 44:58.612
No, you didn't.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.865
You are so annoying
when you get calm voice!

45:05.453 --> 45:07.496
Are those my fucking cats?

45:07.663 --> 45:10.165
They're mine.
I paid for their cat surgery,

45:10.291 --> 45:11.333
so they're mine.

45:11.501 --> 45:12.667
Did my cats die
and you didn't tell me?

45:12.794 --> 45:13.877
Are those replacement cats?

45:14.045 --> 45:16.838
No! They're the same
goddamn cats!

45:20.802 --> 45:22.469
If you do that,
your knight is vulnerable.

45:22.637 --> 45:23.804
What?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.847
Oh, thanks.

45:26.015 --> 45:27.641
You took your finger off it,
you made the move.

45:27.809 --> 45:28.809
I took my finger off it?

45:28.893 --> 45:29.976
Who am I playing here,
Deep Blue?

45:30.144 --> 45:32.145
Karen, come inside.
Have a glass of wine.

45:32.313 --> 45:33.563
Oh, no, I'm fine.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.232
He'll be here.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.441
So you deny it?
That you profited

45:36.526 --> 45:38.360
from her idea that you stole?

45:38.528 --> 45:39.808
No, I don't deny it.
She's right.

45:39.862 --> 45:40.987
The t-shirts were her idea.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.197
Then why did you just
say that?

45:42.365 --> 45:44.658
I like making her mad.
It's so easy.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.326
You took her idea.
That's not just, Mamie-Claire.

45:46.494 --> 45:47.994
No, I tried to include her.

45:48.162 --> 45:49.371
I set up a meeting
with some people

45:49.497 --> 45:50.747
and she never showed up.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.165
And then she stopped
speaking to me

45:52.250 --> 45:53.333
when me and Dylan
got married...

45:53.418 --> 45:55.335
...so I figured
I could just go do it.

45:55.503 --> 45:56.503
So it's her fault?

45:56.587 --> 45:59.339
No. She is right that I stole
a lot of her life ideas.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.675
She really is
more creative than I am.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.135
But she never would have
used them.

46:03.219 --> 46:04.594
She has no follow through.

46:04.679 --> 46:05.762
So it's no one's fault.

46:05.847 --> 46:06.847
Obviously. That's always true.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.224
You know, the restaurant
is going to be really great.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.143
She's following
through with that.

46:11.227 --> 46:12.853
If she's allowed to.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.690
Check.
Wait.

46:16.858 --> 46:18.024
What? No, it isn't.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.234
Check.

46:22.238 --> 46:23.613
I don't want to play anymore.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.781
Oh, come on.

46:24.949 --> 46:25.949
I just don't feel like
playing right now.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.201
You can't just quit
right before I'm about to win.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.569
I'm just not in the mood.
People can be not in the mood.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.414
I couldn't be your mother,
thank God.

46:32.582 --> 46:33.957
What are you, 30? We're 18.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.681
You could. Twelve year olds
can have kids.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.127
- Fuck you!
Mamie-Claire.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.753
Sorry, Karen.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.595
Hey, Dad.
I can't really talk right now.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.388
Brooke...
I'll call you tomorrow,

46:48.473 --> 46:49.723
I'm in the middle
of something.

46:49.891 --> 46:51.141
Yeah, I know
you probably don't care...

46:51.350 --> 46:52.851
I care about things.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.269
But I'm not getting married.

46:54.437 --> 46:55.687
Oh, really?

46:55.855 --> 46:57.856
No.
We called it off last night.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.399
It's for the best.
I don't really know her.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.650
Yeah.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.194
She wasn't committed
to the church, either.

47:02.278 --> 47:03.945
I think that was all forced.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.739
Sure, sure.

47:05.907 --> 47:07.365
You okay?

47:07.533 --> 47:09.159
Yes, I just...

47:09.535 --> 47:11.828
You're really not doing it?

47:11.996 --> 47:14.956
I thought you guys
were really symbiotic.

47:15.124 --> 47:17.792
Wasn't it a web algorithm
that got you together?

47:17.877 --> 47:19.503
She seems amazing.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.505
You never even met Stevie.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.216
Through you, I met her!

47:25.343 --> 47:28.887
Come on, Dad, I don't know.
Don't just bail.

47:30.389 --> 47:32.516
That's what the Cardinases
always do,

47:32.600 --> 47:34.851
move on to something else.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.437
Hang in there!

47:37.647 --> 47:40.315
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're so invested in this.

47:40.483 --> 47:43.026
Believe me, it's for the best.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.197
I have to go,

47:47.281 --> 47:49.282
I have a really important
business meeting.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.326
I love you.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.578
We can do Thanksgiving
at my house if you want,

47:53.663 --> 47:55.038
since there
won't be a wedding.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.873
No, I'll probably just end up

47:56.958 --> 48:00.126
doing something depressing,
but young.

48:00.294 --> 48:01.836
Home is only a bus ride away.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.881
Is it? Just kidding, it is.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.678
So, what does this make
me and Tracy?

48:09.845 --> 48:11.304
Who's Tracy?

48:12.265 --> 48:13.390
Never mind.

48:13.558 --> 48:16.476
Oh, right, her daughter.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.478
Nothing, I guess.

48:27.071 --> 48:28.071
Hello.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.739
Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak.

48:30.533 --> 48:31.533
Are you stalking me?

48:31.701 --> 48:32.701
I left my tote in here.

48:32.868 --> 48:34.286
I need my migraine pills.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.704
Let me have a sip.

48:35.871 --> 48:37.247
How much longer
do you think we'll be here?

48:37.415 --> 48:39.332
I don't know,
however long it takes.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.834
After Dylan comes home, maybe.

48:41.002 --> 48:43.461
What are you really
trying to accomplish here?

48:43.629 --> 48:45.672
I'm enjoying
this really stylish house.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.881
When you live in suburbia,

48:46.966 --> 48:48.686
you have to really like
being in your house.

48:48.801 --> 48:50.093
That's not what I...

48:50.177 --> 48:51.469
What're you doing
with this whole thing?

48:51.637 --> 48:53.054
I want Brooke
to get her restaurant.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.222
I'm helping out.

48:54.390 --> 48:56.683
I read your story, by the way.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.935
Brooke is the woman
in your piece.

49:00.479 --> 49:01.855
You're collecting material.

49:02.023 --> 49:03.064
Did you like it?

49:03.149 --> 49:04.274
That's not
what we're talking about.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.567
Why are you here?

49:05.651 --> 49:07.277
You needed a ride.
You forced me.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.030
How does it feel to be forced?

49:10.197 --> 49:11.281
Feels uncomfortable.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.200
And how do you feel now?

49:15.953 --> 49:17.579
Still uncomfortable.

49:20.791 --> 49:21.916
This is not what I want.
It is what you want...

49:22.084 --> 49:24.204
...but it makes you feel
like a bad person to want it.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.920
You're acting really crazy.
I don't like this.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.714
Why can't you say
you like my story?

49:27.882 --> 49:30.342
I don't know! I'm jealous!

49:31.552 --> 49:33.887
It's better than mine.
Sheesh!

49:34.055 --> 49:36.765
You want other people
to do the things you can't

49:36.849 --> 49:37.891
so you can blame them.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.601
You used to be so nice!

49:39.769 --> 49:41.061
I'm the same.
I'm just the same

49:41.145 --> 49:42.729
in another direction now.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.108
Can I have my glasses back?

49:52.740 --> 49:55.533
Tony, you're more
sophisticated than this!

50:02.124 --> 50:04.542
Dylan, baby, you're home!

50:04.919 --> 50:06.002
You know, I don't like it

50:06.087 --> 50:07.253
when you try to force
affection onto me.

50:07.421 --> 50:08.501
I'm just trying to hug you.

50:08.589 --> 50:09.714
Do you have to put your face
so close to mine?

50:09.799 --> 50:10.799
It's nice.

50:10.883 --> 50:13.051
You know how upset I get
when I visit the home.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.387
I want you
to share it with me.

50:15.554 --> 50:18.598
Rosella and Lorene
may not even be alive

50:18.683 --> 50:19.891
the next time I'm there. Okay?

50:20.059 --> 50:22.143
Just keep your face
a little away

50:22.228 --> 50:23.269
while I process that.

50:23.396 --> 50:24.396
Fine.

50:26.691 --> 50:27.732
Who are all these people?

50:27.900 --> 50:28.983
I wondered
if I could have some water.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.151
Of course, Karen.

50:30.236 --> 50:32.362
Oh, hi, Karen.
I don't mean you.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.030
Tony. Nice to meet you.
Beautiful house, sir.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.115
Thank you.

50:35.199 --> 50:36.366
Have you seen a girl
about this high?

50:36.450 --> 50:37.534
That's my girlfriend.

50:37.702 --> 50:38.993
No, there's more of you?

50:39.161 --> 50:40.203
I'm Tracy.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.455
Oh, Dylan.
Tracy is a tight name.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.624
It's a name
that totally is a name,

50:44.709 --> 50:46.751
but I don't know anyone
actually named Tracy.

50:46.919 --> 50:47.959
I am actually named Tracy.

50:49.130 --> 50:50.130
Tracy!

50:55.886 --> 50:57.011
Brooke!

50:57.847 --> 50:59.055
Hey, Dylan.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.180
Has anyone seen Nicolette?

51:00.224 --> 51:01.266
Forget about
Nicolette for a second.

51:01.350 --> 51:02.600
Stop trying to seduce me.

51:02.768 --> 51:04.519
Thanks.
I got a little parched.

51:04.603 --> 51:05.687
I think I'm sitting
by a heating duct.

51:05.855 --> 51:07.147
Stay here.
Have a glass of wine.

51:07.231 --> 51:08.591
No. Ted really
should be here soon.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.108
Karen!
Can I have a snack?

51:10.276 --> 51:11.556
Stress makes me hungry.

51:11.652 --> 51:14.320
Brooke, I haven't seen you
in a second.

51:14.488 --> 51:15.488
I know, right?

51:15.656 --> 51:16.656
What brings you to the burbs?

51:16.741 --> 51:17.741
We were...

51:17.825 --> 51:18.825
Brooke needs money.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.577
No, I don't need money. I come
to you with an opportunity.

51:20.661 --> 51:22.328
I told her
about the taxi medallions.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.706
Let me make you a drink.
What's the opportunity?

51:24.874 --> 51:25.874
It's a good one.

51:26.000 --> 51:26.958
We're having dinner
at the Baskins.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.042
So I'm sorry to say it,

51:28.169 --> 51:29.127
but you guys
will have to leave now.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.253
Can I have this Chipwich?
Yes.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.417
Marty and Jiselle can wait.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.505
Didn't you park
over at Harold's?

51:32.673 --> 51:33.840
How do you know Harold?

51:34.008 --> 51:35.091
They don't.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.342
She's an old friend.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.761
She can stay over
if she wants.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.304
We have the room for you
and your students.

51:39.388 --> 51:40.430
They're not her students.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.634
It's much weirder than that.

51:41.682 --> 51:42.682
They're my friends.

51:42.725 --> 51:43.808
Always running
with the young crowd.

51:43.893 --> 51:45.013
She's starting a restaurant.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.186
I can't wait
to tell you about it.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.270
Dylan, let's not do this.

51:47.354 --> 51:48.396
She's already
lost her shit once.

51:48.522 --> 51:49.522
What's the restaurant?

51:49.607 --> 51:50.648
Brooke, this is uncomfortable.

51:50.733 --> 51:51.775
Dylan doesn't want to do this.

51:51.859 --> 51:53.026
You don't know
what I want.

51:53.194 --> 51:54.235
I know you see
me a certain way,

51:54.361 --> 51:55.779
but I'm not just some square.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.030
I saw Nirvana live

51:57.114 --> 51:58.573
and this is way before
Nevermind.

51:58.741 --> 51:59.949
You seem really cool to me.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.868
I DJ'ed at my college
radio station,

52:01.952 --> 52:03.036
the 2:00 am slot.

52:03.204 --> 52:04.537
We played Mudhoney,

52:04.622 --> 52:05.705
Superchunk,
Trip Shakespeare, I mean...

52:05.873 --> 52:07.248
No one wants to hear about
your glory days

52:07.374 --> 52:08.875
in college radio, Dylan. Okay?

52:08.959 --> 52:09.959
I do.

52:10.044 --> 52:11.294
I play this part for you.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.379
I play the guy
wearing the fleece...

52:13.547 --> 52:14.631
...but I'm not just
some asshole

52:14.715 --> 52:16.424
bankrolling
your fitness goals.

52:16.592 --> 52:17.952
I've gotten
really into triathlons.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.052
Brooke teaches cycling.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.220
So cool.

52:20.387 --> 52:21.471
No, I only like cycling
when it's combined

52:21.555 --> 52:22.597
with running and swimming.

52:22.765 --> 52:23.765
Why did you think of us?

52:23.891 --> 52:24.891
Because we owe her.

52:25.059 --> 52:26.309
Because you're
into cool things.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.978
We are. You guys want to
smoke some weed? Huh?

52:29.146 --> 52:30.730
I have some frozen weed.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.774
MC, where's that weed
Jason gave us?

52:32.942 --> 52:34.734
You've just said
"weed" like 15 times.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.110
Did that kid
take my weed?

52:36.278 --> 52:37.779
No! No one's touched it.

52:37.905 --> 52:39.989
It should be
next to the Chipwiches.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.118
Are you sick?

52:44.245 --> 52:45.325
No, I'm healthy.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.789
Don't shut me out. You know
how hard that is for me.

52:47.957 --> 52:49.165
You sound like
you're eating something.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.834
I have a Chipwich for you.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.293
You brought me a Chipwich?

52:52.461 --> 52:53.753
I can get you another one.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.505
Leave me alone!

52:55.673 --> 52:56.965
It was clear
that the thing that Meadow

52:57.091 --> 52:58.633
wanted most in the world...

52:58.801 --> 53:01.177
...the thing that she wanted
to define her...

53:01.345 --> 53:03.972
...to give her a place
to put her time and talents,

53:04.098 --> 53:05.265
her everything...

53:05.432 --> 53:07.433
...the restaurant,
it was clear

53:07.518 --> 53:08.977
that it would never happen.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.770
The most
surprising thing was that

53:10.855 --> 53:12.939
Meadow was actually
surprised by it.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.775
She could see the whole world
with painful accuracy...

53:15.943 --> 53:18.778
...but couldn't see herself
or her fate.

53:18.988 --> 53:20.613
And because
I was in love with her...

53:21.282 --> 53:23.116
...I decided
I couldn't see it either.

53:23.284 --> 53:24.826
I'm starting a restaurant.

53:24.994 --> 53:26.119
Oh, I'm an attorney.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.496
That's awesome for you.
I never went to college.

53:28.664 --> 53:30.264
That doesn't
have to be a permanent state.

53:30.291 --> 53:31.499
You aren't an amputee.

53:31.667 --> 53:32.667
I know that.

53:32.835 --> 53:33.955
You can still go to college.

53:34.003 --> 53:36.379
We'll get lifted and you'll
tell us about this venture.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.298
Do any of you kids know
how to make an apple bong?

53:38.465 --> 53:39.757
No one knows
how to make an apple bong.

53:39.842 --> 53:41.509
I do.
Did you take my herb?

53:41.635 --> 53:42.677
No.
I'll get you an apple.

53:42.845 --> 53:44.605
The restaurant
is really going to be amazing.

53:44.722 --> 53:47.056
Right. Let's hear your pitch.
Pitch us.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.504
What?
That's what you do.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.393
If someone wants something,
they pitch.

53:50.477 --> 53:52.812
Come,
pitch us on our media stage.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.148
Your media stage?

53:55.316 --> 53:57.150
We just ran
Apocalypto on Blu-ray.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.569
Stunning. Stunning.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.237
I've gotten very into vinyl.

54:01.405 --> 54:04.032
I'm into compressed MP3s.
Just joking.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.992
I've got a great early
Mother Love Bone EP

54:06.076 --> 54:07.327
that would be perfect
for this occasion.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.329
Records are so warm.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.331
What are you doing?

54:14.585 --> 54:16.920
I just want you to know
that I really love Dylan.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.922
I love his blond hair
and his beard.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.882
I know that you only
loved him for his money.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.884
But I love him as a person.

54:23.052 --> 54:24.177
And I also
love him for his money,

54:24.261 --> 54:25.386
but not in that order.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.347
I'm committed
to being a happier person.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.514
Do you understand?

54:44.031 --> 54:45.239
Um, well...

54:46.033 --> 54:47.825
It's a restaurant,

54:47.910 --> 54:50.453
but also where you,
like, cut hair.

54:51.372 --> 54:52.372
Can I start over?

54:52.748 --> 54:55.249
Of course.
We're old friends.

54:55.417 --> 54:56.417
Okay, great.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.881
I was, that was...

55:02.049 --> 55:03.925
...pretend rewind. Like...

55:10.391 --> 55:11.933
It would have...

55:12.643 --> 55:16.729
...big heavy
tables and chairs.

55:19.900 --> 55:20.900
Um...

55:20.985 --> 55:22.944
It would feel like the home

55:23.070 --> 55:25.655
everyone wishes
they had been raised in.

55:34.498 --> 55:35.665
No one who comes there

55:35.749 --> 55:37.083
will want to take out
their cellphones...

55:37.251 --> 55:38.251
...because it won't
feel that way.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.461
It would be like
taking your cellphone

55:40.587 --> 55:42.255
out in the woods.
Totally wrong.

55:42.423 --> 55:43.631
It's so rude, I concur.

55:43.799 --> 55:45.675
Yeah. It will always
feel like fall inside.

55:45.843 --> 55:49.095
Even on hot summer nights
with all the windows open.

55:49.263 --> 55:52.306
Loaves of bread
that people tear off pieces.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.600
It would be the kind of place
where at 2:00 am,

55:54.685 --> 55:56.352
the chef and the waitstaff...

55:56.520 --> 55:58.021
...would come out
and eat something simple

55:58.105 --> 55:59.225
they had fixed themselves...

55:59.314 --> 56:01.190
...with the remaining guests.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.817
And open
a bottle of good wine.

56:02.985 --> 56:04.345
It would be the best
of capitalism.

56:04.486 --> 56:05.695
What politicians
pretend they mean

56:05.779 --> 56:06.939
when they say small business.

56:07.031 --> 56:08.698
We would resist
doing too many pieces

56:08.782 --> 56:09.949
in the Times and stuff...

56:10.117 --> 56:12.368
...because we would
want it to stay honest.

56:12.536 --> 56:15.288
They would want us to expand
and open another one...

56:15.456 --> 56:16.956
...and maybe eventually
we would.

56:17.124 --> 56:18.791
But we wouldn't try
to re-create the first one.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.044
It would be
a totally new thing.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.670
And if I ever had kids...

56:22.838 --> 56:24.213
...they would walk there
after school

56:24.298 --> 56:26.799
and do their homework
in a corner table.

56:26.967 --> 56:28.384
They would grow up
around all these

56:28.469 --> 56:29.844
wonderful adults.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.387
Chefs and actors
who are waiters.

56:31.472 --> 56:33.639
It'd be a big funny family
and they'd never be lonely.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.642
This could all be something
you guys share in.

56:36.810 --> 56:38.895
You'd be their
auntie and uncle,

56:38.979 --> 56:41.731
part of the life and food.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.275
Eventually I'd train someone
younger than myself

56:44.359 --> 56:45.485
to run the day to day...

56:45.652 --> 56:49.322
...so I could go up to Maine
with my family in the summer.

56:49.490 --> 56:51.324
And have the kids
dive for lobsters.

56:52.993 --> 56:54.952
And everyone would be
so warm and happy inside

56:55.037 --> 56:56.662
knowing that in their lives...

56:56.830 --> 56:59.415
...they had participated
in something

56:59.500 --> 57:01.667
that was only good.

57:03.837 --> 57:05.171
Wow.

57:05.339 --> 57:06.422
Yeah.

57:31.865 --> 57:32.865
You know...

57:34.118 --> 57:36.536
...I lived in the city
for many years.

57:37.204 --> 57:39.705
Before I started at Goldman,
I was...

57:40.207 --> 57:43.292
I was teaching at Baruch

57:43.377 --> 57:44.961
and I lived
in an East Village walk-up.

57:47.881 --> 57:49.340
I was the people,

57:49.424 --> 57:51.592
people make
television shows about.

57:54.054 --> 57:55.263
It was quite beautiful.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.810
This is very
fucking interesting!

58:00.894 --> 58:01.936
Really?

58:02.104 --> 58:03.437
So, are you both doing it?

58:03.605 --> 58:04.725
No, but we're sisters and...

58:04.773 --> 58:05.853
Tracy is spiritual guidance

58:05.899 --> 58:07.108
- and waitress.
- Mmm.

58:07.276 --> 58:09.196
Really? I wasn't sure
you'd heard me those times.

58:09.278 --> 58:10.486
I hear everything.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.321
And how much do you need?

58:12.489 --> 58:14.699
It's $200,000,
but I calculated

58:14.783 --> 58:16.492
and we need $42,500 by Monday.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.077
For refrigeration.

58:18.245 --> 58:19.662
42.5 stacks, huh?

58:19.830 --> 58:21.455
What are stacks?
A thousand.

58:21.582 --> 58:22.957
I thought stacks
meant a hundred.

58:23.125 --> 58:24.375
I'm pretty sure
a stack is a thousand.

58:24.459 --> 58:25.699
I thought a dime
was a thousand.

58:25.752 --> 58:27.503
Never mind.
You'd do that?

58:27.671 --> 58:29.130
I want to help you.

58:29.464 --> 58:31.007
That's Ted. Bye, everyone.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.466
Bye, Karen!

58:32.759 --> 58:34.093
Good luck
with your restaurant.

58:34.261 --> 58:35.261
Thank you!

58:35.304 --> 58:36.387
Dylan, this is really
something for us

58:36.471 --> 58:37.680
to talk about privately.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.682
Or maybe with Dr. Turkowitz.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.642
We need fresh drinks.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.479
Um, Mamie-Claire,
can you come here please?

58:45.647 --> 58:46.772
Can it wait, Karen?

58:46.940 --> 58:48.149
No.

58:50.485 --> 58:51.944
It's not Ted.

58:52.112 --> 58:53.112
Harold.

58:55.949 --> 58:58.993
Your guests' car
is blocking my driveway.

58:59.745 --> 59:00.870
Could the weed be
in the garage freezer?

59:00.954 --> 59:01.954
I don't know.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.873
Can you check?
No!

59:04.041 --> 59:07.126
I'm blowing Harold.
Just kidding.

59:07.294 --> 59:08.961
I can't remember the last time
I was over here.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.631
I don't think you've ever
been over here, Harold.

59:11.798 --> 59:14.800
No, when you first moved here,
I came for a stilted barbecue.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.802
That was when
we made an effort.

59:16.970 --> 59:20.306
Well, invite me in now.
I want a house tour.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.687
You are such a Swiss
Army knife kind of guy.

59:26.855 --> 59:30.524
I have to be a better loser.
I really love Nicolette.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.818
She's angry
about the chess game?

59:32.986 --> 59:34.028
Yeah, I think so.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.323
I'm mostly in touch
with my feminine side, but...

59:37.491 --> 59:39.492
...then I guess not,
though, because...

59:39.660 --> 59:41.202
...I don't understand
her right now.

59:41.995 --> 59:45.081
Did you... Did you
want to be with me ever?

59:45.249 --> 59:46.449
I don't want to get into this.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.335
No, I'm not going to kiss you.
Just a question.

59:49.503 --> 59:50.503
Yeah.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.422
I liked you, but...

59:53.590 --> 59:54.757
...I love Nicolette.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.842
And honestly,
I just never saw you that way.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.010
Why?

59:58.178 --> 59:59.178
You seemed...

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:04.225
I need someone I can love.
Not keep up with.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.347
Sometimes I really just think

01:00:08.397 --> 01:00:10.231
I'm smarter and better
than everyone else.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.192
Not necessarily with...

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:14.443
...math or science

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.946
or whether something
is east or west, but...

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.115
...pretty much
with everything else.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.575
And if I could
figure out my look...

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.077
...I'd be the most
beautiful woman

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.578
in the world too.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.372
Sometimes
I think I'm a genius...

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.499
...and I wish I could just
fast-forward my life

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.377
to the part where
everyone knows it.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.015
I have to say,
I'm impressed, Brooke.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.517
It takes a lot of moxie
to start a restaurant.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:47.685
Thanks.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.228
You're doing it, babe.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.063
You're out there
doing something

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.441
besides amassing
and hoarding money.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:54.734
If I could figure
out how to

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.402
amass and hoard money,
I'd do it.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.529
Well, you could have married
me or a dozen other guys...

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.906
...but you wanted
to be your own person.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.616
Yeah, no, I'm over that now.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.037
You're funny 'cause
you don't know you're funny.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.246
I know I'm funny.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:08.956
There's nothing
I don't know about myself.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:11.083
That's why I can't do therapy.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.545
MC and I
see a woman in New Haven.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.672
Oh, you guys
see a therapist?

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.342
She's totally on my side.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:22.011
She basically thinks

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.846
Mamie-Claire
is holding me back...

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.182
...and I should just
leave her.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.309
Your couple's therapist
said that?

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:30.227
In so many words.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.688
But Mamie-Claire said you guys
are trying to have kids.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:33.856
We've talked about it,

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.150
but we've also talked about
breaking up.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:37.234
Oh...

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.028
I'm so sorry.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.196
No.

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:41.697
No, it's...

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:43.574
...it's liberating.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.535
I feel great.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.745
Yay!

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:51.290
I miss New York, man.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.125
I miss you.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:57.755
I look you up periodically
on the Internet.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:01.342
Oh, you look hot as hell
in those party pictures.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:02.468
Which parties?
Because sometimes

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.886
I look like I have fat arms.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:05.638
I like fat arms.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.014
Oh...

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.237
I'm going to help you
with this restaurant.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:10.935
Thank you!

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.065
Mmm.

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:22.613
Here's what
I'm gonna do for you.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:25.825
We'll take
my 43 stacks or dimes...

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:28.035
...and pay back
the other investors

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.495
whatever
they're in for thus far.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:31.622
You got a space already?
A lease?

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.230
We'll put it up
for rent immediately.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.458
It, uh, cool neighborhood?

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:35.960
Williamsburg?

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:37.294
Oh, come on, the coolest.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:38.629
We'll turn it over,
no problem.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.673
Because, let's face it.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.258
Having a restaurant,

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:46.804
it's like having a kid
with a drug problem.

01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:49.181
It's just...

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.725
It's really draining.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.563
You're giving me money
to not start a restaurant?

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.440
First of all, I am saving you.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.607
If you started the restaurant,

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.235
you would be back here
in a year asking for...

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:02.736
...five times this.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:04.196
Not if it was successful.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.367
What are the odds?

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.202
You know...

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:15.166
...I'd love to see
your life in the city.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.376
We should get a drink. Or...

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.088
I like to drink.

01:03:21.173 --> 01:03:22.173
Mmm.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.676
Whatever you're doing,
it's working.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.178
No.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:29.847
No, it isn't.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.310
Hey, guys.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.686
Did you ever find the pot?

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:38.439
Tony just made the most
beautiful apple bong.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:41.442
We'll have to, because
some celebrating is in order.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:43.967
I think we might have
reached a deal.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:47.323
Yes. Dylan has made
a proposition.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.741
I'm going to give her
the money.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.075
Yay!

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.536
What? You're giving her money?

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:54.163
Who was at the door?
Harold.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.807
He's giving himself
a tour of the house.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.517
And where's Karen?
I don't fucking know!

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.709
You're giving her money?

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.878
This is our decision,
not yours.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.838
I'm not giving her 200 grand.
Don't worry.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.966
I'm just bailing her out
of her current situation.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.175
And then for
the whole restaurant?

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.177
No, I'm not gonna
do the restaurant now.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.387
It's just gotten too crazy.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.264
This is a good result.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.599
This is even better
than getting the restaurant.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.142
Less financial
uncertainty.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:18.062
He's right. I think
I even feel a little relieved.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.522
Mom's wasn't about money.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.023
Well, I don't think
anyone starts anything

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.609
with the dream
of not making money.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:24.777
Do they not?

01:04:24.945 --> 01:04:26.820
Why would you give her money?

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:28.239
Because it's my money.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.492
I make it, and I can do
what I want with it.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.701
Like you have
your t-shirt money.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:33.869
You can do what you want
with that.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.872
We're married.
This is, this is our life.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.457
It's a real life.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.293
I know Brooke
doesn't believe that,

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.003
but you do.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.386
You know what?

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.638
I appreciate the offer, Dylan,

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.890
but I'm not going
to take the money.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:02.106
I just wasn't
brought up that way.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:04.191
What will you do?

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.442
I'll figure it out.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.236
I always do.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.779
I am so impressed by you

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.156
and so worried for you
at the same time.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.785
I'm so glad you're my sister.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:17.204
What are you talking about?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.123
Nothing happened. I love you!

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:21.667
Don't lie to my face and stab
me in the back, butter boy!

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.711
That's so mean!
Destroyer!

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:24.837
What? No, I'm not.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.463
You're stealing my boyfriend!
You're cuckolding me.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.007
- You bitch whore!
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.216
Stop it!

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.467
Who the fuck are you?

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.677
This is my girlfriend
Nicolette.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.803
She's usually very polite.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.771
What is it about this house?
Everyone screams.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.009
She's stealing my boyfriend!

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.099
I am not!

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.517
I resisted! I resisted!

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:39.685
Chill the fuck out!

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:40.853
I don't like
shouting around the baby.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:41.979
Is that a real thing?

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.943
I'm right here, and she's
not stealing anything.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:46.400
It's not just that!
There's also this!

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.776
What the fuck is that?

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.236
Or cursing!
Sorry, Karen.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:50.529
Tracy knows what it is.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.865
I'll give you a hint.
It's onionskin.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:54.950
She's a home wrecker
and a bad person.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.952
Stop calling her
these old-timey names.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.746
I don't know why
you're defending her.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.664
She's publishing this story
all about you.

01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:01.790
I'm not publishing anything.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.876
I don't even know
if I got into the Lit Society.

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:05.085
It's very competitive.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.670
This is so nerdy.
Yep.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.130
Baby, I resisted.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.256
Can I get a drink?

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.175
Have mine.
They keep offering me alcohol.

01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:12.509
You wrote a story
about me?

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.517
She hates you. She wrote
mean things about you.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.764
It's not you.
It's just inspired.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.015
You make me want to write.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.767
I want to read it
if it's about me.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.477
I'd like to read it too.
You don't read fiction.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:22.978
When it's about
my friends, I do.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.731
It's not really you.
It's just very funny.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.191
The character
that Nicolette and Tony

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:28.651
misconstrued as being you...

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.152
...is a very funny character.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.821
Funny? What does it say?

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.324
It's not funny.
It's just, it's not you.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.702
Do you live in an apartment
that's zoned commercial?

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.121
Give me that story.

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.517
It wasn't meant to be hurtful.

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.102
I didn't mean to hurt you,
Brooke.

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.311
You don't get to decide

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.772
what's hurtful
and not hurtful.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.565
I can only tell you
my intention.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:11.819
You wrote this
after one night with me? One?

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.487
I guess so.
Yeah, it felt longer.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.780
You think
I'm a rotting carcass?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.157
That I am doomed to failure?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:19.493
No. It's fiction,
that's why it's fiction.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:22.496
So much of this "fiction"
did not happen this way.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:23.831
Karen, you're a lawyer.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.166
I'm going to sue you
until you have nothing.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.376
I'm just writing from my life.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.962
No! This is not your life.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.755
But I was there that night.

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.132
I was gonna
have that night anyway.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.425
You never were.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:35.759
But I did have it, though.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.178
You joined my life.
You needed a place to go.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:41.140
I invited you in
and then you stole my life.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.809
You're a leech! A bloodsucker.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.728
You loved being admired by me.
You loved it.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.604
You loved having
lessons to impart.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:50.107
I didn't ask for you!

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:51.984
Brooke,
you know great plays, right?

01:07:52.152 --> 01:07:54.153
How would it have been
if Tennessee Williams

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.359
hadn't used people he knew?

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:56.607
There wouldn't be any plays...

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.698
I don't give a shit

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.118
because I am not a friend
of Tennessee Williams!

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:03.662
You took something I said

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.428
and made a tweet about it.
How about that?

01:08:05.457 --> 01:08:08.250
That's different! It wasn't
some sneaky shitty thing.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.501
You knew I was Twittering.

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.962
Do you want me to credit you?
No, I'll just delete it.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.714
That's not the point.
I'm asking you to empathize.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:15.716
It was my least popular
tweet anyway.

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:18.010
Stop talking about Twitter,
it's so awkward.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:19.511
You are much more
of an asshole

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:20.679
than you initially appear.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:22.180
I agree.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640
You think I haven't dealt

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.184
with the pain
of my mother's death?

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:29.688
I deal with it all the time!
I talk about it all the time!

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:32.357
You talk about it all the time
but you never talk about her.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:33.649
You just throw out
that she died

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:34.818
and that shuts everyone up.

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.194
Your tragedy is your armor

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:37.720
in which nothing
is ever your fault.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.823
Please! Please, friends!

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:42.826
Somebody defend me
against this monster!

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.368
It was in pretty poor taste.

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:45.703
I didn't even
like the writing.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.872
Like your whole generation,
it's all pastiche.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.750
It's not a nice story.
I told you.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.710
I also told you.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.587
The emotional betrayal,
I can't speak to.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:55.255
I didn't betray her.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.216
But I can say that
you portray women terribly.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.384
And because of that,

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:02.054
I've prepared some questions
I'd like you to think about.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:03.596
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:07.559
One. Do you believe
in a woman's right to choose?

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:08.894
Yes. What does that...

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.062
Excuse me, I'm not done.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.229
She's not done, bitch!

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:12.564
Brooke, please.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.024
Two. What do you think

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.442
someone who bombs
abortion clinics

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.609
would think of your story?

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.237
There isn't even
an abortion in the story.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:19.613
No,
you just portray women

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.698
as crazy desperate
gold diggers.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.117
Three. Do you believe
the perpetrators

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.036
of female genital
mutilation...

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.964
...would be hindered
or helped by your story?

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.374
You seemed so cool,
so totally amazing...

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.709
...I didn't think it would be
possible to hurt you.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.420
Of course
it's possible to hurt me.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.714
I am the most
sensitive person.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:38.881
To your own feelings.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:39.925
Mamie-Claire!

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.176
Sorry,
I don't really think that,

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.719
it's just something
I would have said at one time.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:44.720
I have to say,

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.223
what you did to Brooke
is F-ed up.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.551
Karen, you don't see my side?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.767
No, sweetheart.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.103
You don't have a side.
You're just wrong.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.813
You must call
the Lit Society

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.940
and tell them
you're withdrawing your essay.

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.150
It's not an essay.
It's a short story.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.069
This cannot appear
in print or online.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.779
Karen,
will you represent Brooke?

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.906
I'm a tax attorney, but okay.

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.826
We should get dressed, baby.
Dinner at the Baskins.

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.995
There's plenty of room for you
all to spend the night.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.288
You too, Karen.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.123
One sec.

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:12.916
Will you draw up
the contract, please?

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:14.126
Yes.

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:15.544
In the meantime,
I'm gonna ask you

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.087
to rewrite the story...

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.464
...and then give Brooke
the re-written story.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.466
I'll give you my email
and you can BCC me.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.302
She could just CC you.
Nic's right

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.595
because we'd already know
that you're getting it.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:25.804
Sure, CC me.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.472
Technology,
it's very complicated.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.391
I know. I just learned
what case sensitive meant,

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:30.601
seriously, like, yesterday.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.102
I'm not going
to do any of this stuff.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.812
You're my sister
and I love you

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.188
but I stand by what I did.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:36.648
Guess what, bitch?

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:40.527
My dad isn't going to marry
your slutty, atheist mother.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.238
So we're not sisters,
we'll never be.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.198
We're nothing to each other.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.034
There are ten questions here,

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.120
all equally important,
for you to answer.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.505
Brooke...

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:40.712
Mom?

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.422
Oh, honey.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.675
Ruth signed me in.

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:48.804
I just saw a side of him
that I didn't know before.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:52.057
It's strange to not
really know someone.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.141
Oh.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:56.144
I'm sorry.
I know you liked Brooke.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:59.272
He told me
that she worships you.

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:02.150
She kept talking about

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.403
how smart you are,
and interesting.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.740
Oh, honey. Don't cry.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.828
I went through a break-up too.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.331
You didn't tell me
you were seeing anybody.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:17.499
I know.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:22.212
Oh, my sweet girl.
Do you want to talk about it?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.380
No.

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.216
It's too late now, anyway.

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:30.262
I know this is crappy timing,
but I need to take a vacation.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.515
And I got the deposit back
for the flowers...

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:36.268
...and Colleen told me
to come with her family

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.853
to the Caribbean
over Thanksgiving.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.188
And, Trace, I need it.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.649
That sounds nice, Stevie.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.651
So, you're okay
for Thanksgiving,

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:46.069
not coming home?

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.154
Oh.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.656
I didn't put that together.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.200
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be fine.

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:53.785
Are you okay?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.663
I'm very sad,
but I'll be okay.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.208
I wish it had worked out...

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.919
...even though
I didn't really know him.

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.551
Me too, Baby Tracy.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.612
You're in.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.629
Dream baby dream

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:48.840
Dream baby dream

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.302
Dream baby dream

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:55.639
Dream baby dream

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.685
Okay. Tracy, I'm ready.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:06.149
Sometimes I worry
that I'm a bad person.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:08.902
That I'm one of those people

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.862
who essentially
has no conscience.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.907
Spirit says...

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:20.205
...you need to find
your home in yourself.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.625
Spirit says...

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:28.463
...you haven't dropped
into your body yet.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.467
If I'm not in my body
then where am I?

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:36.721
Five feet to the left
and unhappy.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.480
Dream baby dream

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:48.150
Dream baby dream

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:50.026
If a person wanted
to start their own club,

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.195
how would a person
go about it?

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:53.780
Well,
I think it's pretty much done

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:55.073
for this semester...

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.784
...but you could
put in an application

01:14:57.869 --> 01:15:00.162
for funding next semester.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.625
Hey!

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.211
Can I come in?

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:10.380
Okay.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:15.051
You going home
for Thanksgiving?

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.304
No, I'm going to Baltimore
with Nicolette.

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.471
Oh. Nice.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:20.849
Her dad fries a turkey,
apparently.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.019
You?
No.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:30.066
It's an application. Two.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.571
I don't want to join Mobius.
Had enough rejection.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:37.532
It's not for Mobius.
I quit the briefcase club.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.742
You were right,

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:40.869
they're self-elected
douchebags.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:42.746
I'm starting my own zine

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.748
and I'm not saying
you're in...

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:46.374
...but I'd be very interested

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:49.044
in getting your
and Nicolette's applications.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.383
I'll fix us
some screwdrivers.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:57.719
Okay.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.138
It's my direction

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:44.683
It's my proposal

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:49.479
It's so hard
It's leading me astray

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.282
Hello.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.826
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
on Thanksgiving,

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:03.952
but I met you once.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120
I went through your window,

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.621
it was the middle
of the night.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:08.331
Yeah.
I was with Brooke.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:09.457
You're her sister, right?

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.209
Well, I was going to be.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.587
Do you have a number for her?
The old one isn't working.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.131
I don't.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:20.218
Anyway, I was gonna ask you,
do you know where she went?

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.645
Her front door
is still bolted shut.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.900
She's upstairs.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.446
Thank you, Kareem.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:40.572
You're welcome.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:10.810
Hi.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.230
Hi.

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.524
Can I come in?

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.277
You're leaving?

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.528
In a couple of hours.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.697
I'm gonna
try my luck out west.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.449
You're going today,
on Thanksgiving?

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:27.035
New York isn't the New York
I used to know.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:28.578
There's too much construction.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.121
Maybe L.A. is my lady.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.499
In L.A.,
I qualify as well-read.

01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:34.376
I wanted to say...

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.543
I know that you're sorry.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:36.878
I'm not really that sorry.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.922
You're not?
No.

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.131
Oh, well, then fuck this!

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:41.299
No!

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.592
No, wait.

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.345
I looked for you.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.180
I've been around.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.557
Are you okay?
Like financially?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:51.726
Yeah.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.478
Mamie-Claire gave me
what would have been

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.230
my share
of the t-shirt profits.

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:56.898
It was just enough
to pay my debt

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.024
and get out of town.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.984
What will you do in L.A.?

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:01.361
I don't know.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.321
I think I'm sick.

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.657
And I don't know
if my ailment has a name.

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.410
It's just me
sitting and staring

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.453
at the Internet
or the television...

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.330
...for long periods of time

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:14.958
interspersed by trying
to not do that.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.710
And then lying about
what I've been doing.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.964
Then I'll get
so excited about something

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.841
that the excitement
overwhelms me...

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:25.802
...and I can't sleep
or do anything.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.888
And I just am in love
with everything...

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:30.515
...but can't figure out

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.642
how to make myself
work in the world.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.060
I think I have that too.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.646
I wish we lived
in feudal times...

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.982
...where your position
in the world couldn't change.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:40.817
If you were a king
or a peasant,

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:43.862
you had to just be happy
with who you were.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.198
But wait.

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:51.953
You can
tutor SAT's now.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.961
Well, I thought I might
actually go to college.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.081
I'm not an amputee.

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:56.332
Right.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.042
I filled out
a couple of applications.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.919
I wrote my college essay
all about you.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.254
Really?

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.549
Oh, snap!
No. It's about my mom.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:05.717
But I had you there.

01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:06.885
Yeah.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:10.930
I let Mamie-Claire
and Dylan keep the cats.

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:14.309
It's like, I gave them
a chance for a better life...

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.145
...better than the life
that I could provide them.

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.398
The cats went
from stolen to given

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:21.733
because you changed your mind.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:23.860
Don't
put that in a story.

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.737
Not because I care,

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.948
but because it isn't
a very good observation.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.786
You know what's funny?

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.456
I'm not even done with my
first semester of college yet.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.209
This won't even be
your big college story.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:42.337
I think it will always
be pretty big.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.382
Well, thanks
for stopping by...

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.594
...but I have more packing
before Kareem comes over...

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.596
...and we break down
the front door.

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:54.807
It will be hard for me
not to look at New York

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.392
and think of you
somewhere in it.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.560
Yeah.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:02.607
Hey, Brooke?

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.612
It's not going to be as great

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:10.573
as what my mom and your dad
were planning, but...

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:13.034
...do you want to have
Thanksgiving with me?

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:30.093
Meadow had made
rich fat women less fat

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.345
and rich stupid kids
less stupid...

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:35.348
...and lame rich men
less lame.

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:38.643
And she wanted so badly
to be on the other side...

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:42.355
...to be fat and stupid
and lame and rich.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.399
But what she couldn't see
most of all...

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:45.733
...more than she
couldn't see that

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:47.735
she was never going
to get the restaurant...

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.947
...was that those people
were nothing compared to her.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:53.116
They were matches
to her bonfire.

01:21:53.284 --> 01:21:57.620
She was the last cowboy,
all romance and failure.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.163
The world was changing,

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.332
and her kind
didn't have anywhere to go.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.876
Being a beacon of hope
for lesser people

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:05.628
is a lonely business.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.548
You could've been all right

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.675
