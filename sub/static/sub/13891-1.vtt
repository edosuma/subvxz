00:38.340 --> 00:41.059
Ow! Yeah!

00:41.060 --> 00:42.539
Hey, budski!

00:42.540 --> 00:44.699
All right, man?
Just watching the racing.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.779
I've got a bet
on the dispenser 55.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.419
Come on, Golden Boy, you big lump.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.259
Golders! There we go!
Come on, you're winning by a snout!

00:52.260 --> 00:55.179
That's the lad! Come on,
you fine thing, you! Here we go!

00:55.180 --> 00:57.459
God!

00:57.460 --> 00:59.779
You lazy fat pig.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.980
That's 100 dollar-pounds
down the crapper.

01:03.340 --> 01:04.860
Pigs racing!

01:05.900 --> 01:07.660
Hey! What's this?

01:08.980 --> 01:12.259
Found that in Petersen's quarters.
Some crazy stuff in that, man.

01:12.260 --> 01:15.539
For instance, did you know
that in the 1970s in Sweden,

01:15.540 --> 01:18.899
20% of all traffic accidents
involved a moose?

01:18.900 --> 01:21.179
A moose?
It's crazy, that, isn't it?

01:21.180 --> 01:24.899
Well, if they're stupid enough
to let 'em drive,
what the hell do they expect?

01:24.900 --> 01:27.699
The moose aren't driving.
You just said they were.

01:27.700 --> 01:30.140
They're not driving -
just causing the accidents.

01:30.141 --> 01:34.579
You mean they're in the back
fooling around, distracting
the driver? That is insane.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.059
Why they giving them a lift
in the first place?

01:37.060 --> 01:38.819
Let 'em walk! They got legs!

01:38.820 --> 01:41.979
No, the moose aren't in the cars,
antlers out the sunroof.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.459
They're in the roads, moosing about,
crossing roads, causing accidents.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.179
You mean they're not looking
left and right? Exactly.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.499
Not using the pedestrian crossings?
Exactly.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.619
Not paying attention to whether it's
a little green man or a red man?

01:53.620 --> 01:57.259
Of course they're not!
They're mooses! Eesh!

01:57.260 --> 02:00.180
These Swedes - they expect too much.

02:03.780 --> 02:06.819
Ah, Kryten.
Mail, sir, internal.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.818
Excellent. I resat my astronavs.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.259
Again, sir? Is that wise?

02:11.260 --> 02:13.899
I want to be an officer, Kryten.
I can't help myself.

02:13.900 --> 02:18.059
I've always loved leading. Being
a leader, doing leadery things.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.899
Bossing people about, sir? Exactly.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.699
But aren't you concerned,
though, sir, if you fail,

02:23.700 --> 02:26.340
you'll spend another weekend
sobbing inside a cupboard?

02:28.780 --> 02:31.019
I've only failed nine times, Kryten.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.339
You make me sound like
a complete halfwit. Here we go.

02:34.340 --> 02:35.859
Good luck, sir.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.700
Good luck not required,
you metal munchkin.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.460
Because - and here's
the clever bit - I EXPECT to fail.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.259
You do, sir?

02:47.260 --> 02:49.939
Absolutely, Kryten.
It's a fiendishly difficult paper.

02:49.940 --> 02:52.459
And I've decided
not to be so hard on myself.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.499
If I pass, splendissimo.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.260
If I fail, hey-ho, pip and dandy.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.379
That's my new life slogan.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.019
Oh. Hey-ho, pip and what, sir?

03:04.020 --> 03:07.499
Sometimes you have to learn how to
lose before you're ready to win.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.819
It's all in this fascinating book
I'm reading.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.300
Oh, what's it called, sir?

03:11.301 --> 03:15.139
Sometimes You Have To Learn How
To Lose Before You're Ready To Win.

03:15.140 --> 03:21.099
It's not a long book, Kryten,
but it makes a good point, I think,
which is...

03:21.100 --> 03:24.379
Sometimes you have to learn how to
lose before you're ready to win.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.900
You've read it?

03:27.220 --> 03:28.859
Er... actually, no, I haven't, sir.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.899
Ah, sounds like you have. Anyway...

03:30.900 --> 03:32.539
the point is, after reading it,

03:32.540 --> 03:35.619
I'm much more forgiving
of my little faults and failures.

03:35.620 --> 03:39.219
Whatever the result, I shall
accept it with calm equilibrium.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.939
Hey-ho, pip and dandy, sir!

03:41.940 --> 03:43.340
Exactly.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.059
Can you never, ever,
succeed at anything?!

04:01.060 --> 04:04.740
You useless, rancid, cancerous
sack of sick!

04:09.220 --> 04:13.260
I'm guessing this is a hey-ho,
pip and dandy moment, sir.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.779
'Your craft
has just entered the catchment area

04:17.779 --> 04:20.978
'for the All-Droid Mail Order
Shopping Station.'

04:20.980 --> 04:22.220
Hey, what's this?

04:22.221 --> 04:25.619
'Welcome to All-Droid,
where shopping's made easy.

04:25.620 --> 04:29.819
'That is totally astonishing!
Talk me through this, Bob.'

04:29.820 --> 04:32.819
Oh, these shopping channel ads
are just so lame.

04:32.820 --> 04:36.299
'You simply put your sugar
into your coffee like so,

04:36.300 --> 04:38.259
place it in the housing unit...'

04:38.260 --> 04:40.139
Who buys this junk?

04:40.140 --> 04:42.099
'..grab your Stirmaster,

04:42.100 --> 04:45.899
'and the Stirmaster
stirs your coffee for you!

04:45.900 --> 04:48.419
'Golly! Even I could do that!'

04:48.420 --> 04:51.619
Who'd want that? It's totally junk.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.059
'The average person
who lives to their 90s,

04:54.060 --> 04:55.859
'and has six cups of coffee a day,

'spends over two weeks
stirring drinks!

04:58.980 --> 05:00.899
'Oh, my!' Two weeks?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.259
Two weeks?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.299
'Think what you could do
in that time.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.899
'Two weeks stirring,
or two weeks skiing?

05:07.900 --> 05:11.499
'I know what I'd rather do!
Ha-ha! Me too!

05:11.500 --> 05:13.219
'The Stirmaster.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.259
'A lovely addition
to any modern kitchen.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.540
'Buy yours now!'

05:17.541 --> 05:19.859
I want one. What about you?

05:19.860 --> 05:21.660
I'd like to order a Stirmaster,
please.

05:21.661 --> 05:23.619
Two. Make it two.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.659
'You are presently in
a queue, but we care about your call

05:27.660 --> 05:31.060
'and promise to deal with your order
as soon as possible.'

05:33.260 --> 05:35.979
Sirs? The scouters
have located a derelict.

05:35.980 --> 05:39.020
I'm getting a Stirmaster.
I'm getting one, too.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.180
Have you seen this about mooses?

05:48.500 --> 05:51.740
- Did you have to bring that?
- I'm next up!

05:59.860 --> 06:02.379
Hey, nice ship.

06:02.380 --> 06:05.299
A Quantum Twister, Listey.
The pride of the Space Corps.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.339
My three brothers
served on ships like this.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.459
I had no idea, sir.
What were they - waiters or barmen?

06:10.460 --> 06:13.019
Captains, Kryten.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.019
Proud Fellows of the Space Corps
Super-Infinity Fleet.

06:16.020 --> 06:19.059
And your brothers have the same
genes as you? That's impressive.

06:19.060 --> 06:21.460
It's like a pole-vaulter winning gold
with a chopstick.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.180
It must make you so proud, though,
sir,

06:25.181 --> 06:28.179
knowing that your brothers
served on ships like this.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.379
Must give you a warm glow
in your heart.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.099
Yes, it's called heartburn, Kryten.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.099
I also get palpitations and nausea.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.619
How can you be jealous? Those
Space Corps jocks were all jerks.

06:39.620 --> 06:43.099
Just a load of over-privileged,
practical-joke-playing party boys.

06:43.100 --> 06:47.419
Party boys? They were space marines,
Listey, ripped and pipped.

06:47.420 --> 06:49.019
Do you know what their slogan is?

06:49.020 --> 06:53.059
"While you sleep,
we're probably saving the universe."

06:53.060 --> 06:55.859
You sure? I thought it was,
"While you sleep,

06:55.860 --> 06:59.020
"we're probably shaving off your
pubes and gluing them to your head."

07:00.780 --> 07:02.939
Hey, maybe we could swap ships.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.259
This baby's got to be better
than Red Dwarf.

07:05.260 --> 07:08.019
That crate's slower
than the speed of dark.

07:08.020 --> 07:11.900
Unfortunately impossible, sir.
The Trojan is not flight-worthy.

07:13.180 --> 07:17.019
There must be 40 buttons here,
all for the captain only...

07:17.020 --> 07:19.499
his special private
captainy buttons.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.859
40!

07:20.860 --> 07:25.659
This could have been mine. Why could
I never pass my damned astronavs?

07:25.660 --> 07:28.499
Those Space Corps boys
had everything.
The buttons, the blasters,

07:28.500 --> 07:31.900
the snug elasticated jumpsuits.
They had it all!

07:34.620 --> 07:35.979
Did you see that?

07:35.980 --> 07:38.100
That was cool!

07:39.140 --> 07:40.499
Do it again.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.939
Are you OK?

07:41.940 --> 07:44.859
My Light Bee must have glitched.
Look, I'm going for a look around.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.339
'Welcome to All-Droid.'
Hello? Yeah, still here.
Still holding.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.219
Stirmaster!

07:50.220 --> 07:53.540
Don't forget me! I want one, too!

07:55.340 --> 07:59.219
This ship's got everything.
It's light years ahead of Red Dwarf.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.900
It's even got one of these.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.619
A greeny, glowy thing.

08:05.620 --> 08:08.419
Mm. Sir. That is a quantum rod, sir.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.619
It acts like a magnet,
allowing the ship to star-jump.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.419
Does it? How?

08:13.420 --> 08:17.259
Well, quite simply, sir,
it draws things formerly connected
back together

08:17.260 --> 08:21.499
and, as everything is made
of energy, and all energy
was present at the big bang,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.539
then everything is connected.

08:23.540 --> 08:26.579
So the rod reconnects things
light years apart,

08:26.580 --> 08:29.459
allowing the ship to contract
space/time.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.179
Kryten, you have a real gift.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.698
You make things that are
really, really complicated

08:33.700 --> 08:35.739
sound really, really complicated.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.578
It is a little sensitive, sir.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.659
You should put it back.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.699
What the hell was that?

08:45.700 --> 08:48.139
'This is the Columbus 3.
Do you read me? Over.'

08:48.140 --> 08:51.139
Another ship! 'This is Columbus 3.'
How do we answer it?

08:51.140 --> 08:53.299
Where's the comm switch?
'Do you read me? Over.'

08:53.300 --> 08:55.019
Ah, I've got it.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.539
Rog, Columbus 3.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.699
This is former First Tech
Maintenance Division,

08:59.700 --> 09:02.339
now Acting Commander
Captain Arnold J Rimmer

09:02.340 --> 09:05.019
of the Deep Space Explorer Craft,
Red Dwarf.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.458
What's happening to the chair?

09:06.459 --> 09:08.338
I think that one is the comm switch,
sir.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.220
Why couldn't they mark it
more clearly?

09:10.221 --> 09:12.259
Someone could look a real idiot
doing that.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.899
'This is Columbus 3. Come in.
Do you copy? Over.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.059
'Need help, and fast. Over.'

09:17.060 --> 09:18.699
Go, Columbus. Over.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.979
'Crew dead. Main drive fragmenting.
Do you copy? Over.'

09:21.980 --> 09:23.819
Affirmative. Over.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.939
'Navigation locked in a death dive.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.099
'Ship will impact meteor storm
in 17 hours.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.499
'This is Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
'Can you help us? Over.'

09:35.180 --> 09:37.379
What? Over.

09:37.380 --> 09:41.659
Your brother, sir! What are
the chances? It's extraordinary.
Did the rod do this?

09:41.660 --> 09:45.699
'Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer.
Can you help? Over.'

09:45.700 --> 09:48.699
I can't meet him. How can I meet
him? He's a captain, I'm a nobody.

09:48.700 --> 09:52.699
A vending-machine repair man.
I can't save his life -
it's too embarrassing!

09:52.700 --> 09:55.139
'Trojan, confirm coordinates
received. Over.'

09:55.140 --> 09:58.459
Er... received. Over. Sir,
shall I prepare the teleporters?

09:58.460 --> 10:02.380
I've got 15 hours to pass
my astronavs, become his equal.
Then I can save him.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.019
Columbus, we're on our way.
We'll be there in 15 hours. Over.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.659
But, sir, we could be there
in a matter of seconds.

10:09.660 --> 10:12.099
Kryten, as your superior officer,

10:12.100 --> 10:14.779
I order you to erase the last
five minutes of your memory.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.099
But, sir, that contravenes
my rights of service.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.699
In which case, I also order you

10:18.700 --> 10:21.660
to erase the memory of the order
I just gave you to erase it.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.539
Lister, will you turn that damn
thing off? I'm trying to revise.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.739
I'm getting that Stirmaster, Rimmer.
I'm not hanging up this phone.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.619
It goes everywhere with me.
The loo, the bath - you name it.

10:50.620 --> 10:53.539
If Kochanski walks through that door
now and wants sex,

10:53.540 --> 10:56.899
I'll wedge it in me bum crack
and get to work.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.580
I am not hanging up the phone.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.859
A lateral-thinking question.
I've never been good at these.

11:04.860 --> 11:06.859
Come on, then. Come on, hit me.

11:06.860 --> 11:09.659
Right, it's 1971.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.059
A Swedish man crashes into a tree.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.219
What causes the accident?

11:14.220 --> 11:16.660
It's nothing medical.
Nothing wrong with the car.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.539
Right, so, um...

11:20.540 --> 11:25.179
Swedish guy drives into a tree.
What caused the accident?

11:25.180 --> 11:28.179
Answer's in the back, right? Right.

11:28.180 --> 11:31.499
Wow! It's a really hard one, that.

11:31.500 --> 11:35.059
I mean, you've probably got to be
pretty damn smart

11:35.060 --> 11:36.940
to get a question like that right.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.699
You know what? I'm gonna go for
a moose. A moose?!

11:41.700 --> 11:44.579
Yeah, it was in the road.
He swerved to avoid the moose.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.300
Are you insane? How can it be a...?

11:46.301 --> 11:48.139
It's a moose.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.020
Sometimes life is good.

11:51.020 --> 11:55.139
Ah, sir, you asked me to remind you
it's ten minutes to your exam.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.619
Kryten, a lateral-thinking question.
Just got it myself.

11:58.620 --> 12:00.099
It's 1971.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.539
A Swedish man drives into a tree.
What causes the accident?

12:03.540 --> 12:05.740
It's a moose, sir.
He swerves and hits a tree.

12:08.140 --> 12:11.099
Is it me? How did you get that?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.579
Get what? I've got something for you.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.099
A lateral-thinking question.
A lottery what?

12:16.100 --> 12:19.099
Ah, I knew I could rely on you.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.939
What caused this accident?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.779
What accident?

12:22.780 --> 12:25.380
No, it's a question, all right?
Are you ready?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.219
It's 1971. A man...

12:29.220 --> 12:30.500
Was he Swedish?

12:34.220 --> 12:35.660
Yes. A moose.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.020
It was a moose.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.939
He swerved to avoid it
and hit a tree.

12:49.940 --> 12:53.299
Oh, the moose is on the road,
by the way, not in the car driving.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.500
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

12:58.020 --> 13:00.619
Who am I kidding?
I'm never going to pass this exam.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.220
It's so unfair!

13:20.873 --> 13:23.872
Look at his eyes. They're
spinning beach balls of doom.

13:23.873 --> 13:25.672
His hard disk must have crashed.

13:25.673 --> 13:28.432
Mmm. He's completely helpless.
What are we going to do?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.673
I say we draw a moustache on him.

13:31.873 --> 13:34.872
What? It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

13:34.873 --> 13:36.512
Then we fix it.

13:36.513 --> 13:40.032
But, first, get out the felt-tips.

13:40.033 --> 13:42.593
Who's this?
Oh, look, you can't do this.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.033
You got who it is yet?
Oh, look, this is so wrong.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.672
You can't do this.
It's so... It's so...

13:48.673 --> 13:50.193
It's Salvador Dali. My go!

13:58.073 --> 14:00.312
How long have I been out?

14:00.313 --> 14:03.833
Three hours. It took longer than
we thought to rub off the felt-tip.

14:05.073 --> 14:06.152
What happened?

14:06.153 --> 14:11.152
Well, sir, your hard drive was
overrun by a form of self-created
malware, sir...

14:11.153 --> 14:14.872
millions of unnecessary memory files
clogging up your system.

14:14.873 --> 14:18.432
The average person
has 3,000 different thoughts a day.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.672
HE only has three.

14:20.673 --> 14:24.512
But of your thoughts,
over 60% were you obsessing about
past resentments.

14:24.513 --> 14:27.152
Your brothers' success,
your career failure,

14:27.153 --> 14:29.113
your death, your lousy sex life.

14:30.873 --> 14:35.032
Over the years, your system has
become so engorged with resentment,

14:35.033 --> 14:37.072
you've had a massive data jam.

14:37.073 --> 14:39.512
Are you saying
I'm a resentful person?

14:39.513 --> 14:41.313
I really resent that.

14:42.353 --> 14:45.072
Probably explains
why you couldn't pass the exam.

14:45.073 --> 14:47.032
There's no room left in your head.

14:47.033 --> 14:48.153
So, what happens now?

14:48.154 --> 14:52.232
Well, we've drained the resentments
and we've cleaned up
your hard drive.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.072
Oh. I feel different.

14:54.073 --> 14:56.232
My head definitely feels roomier.

14:56.233 --> 14:59.713
Once, I lived in a tiny one-bed.
Now I'm in a barn conversion.

15:00.993 --> 15:04.512
This is great! I can finally
pass that exam, impress Howard.

15:04.513 --> 15:06.592
What, your brother?

15:06.593 --> 15:08.431
We got a distress call
from his ship.

15:08.432 --> 15:10.673
I didn't want to see him
until I'd become an officer.

15:10.674 --> 15:13.072
Howard? Wasn't he the one
in the Space Scouts

15:13.073 --> 15:15.193
who painted your todge
with orange glow paint?

15:16.713 --> 15:20.712
For three whole nights,
I could read Biggles Flies West
under the bed sheets

15:20.713 --> 15:23.152
without needing a torch.

15:23.153 --> 15:27.473
When I lay on my back,
I could have doubled as a lighthouse
for really small ships.

15:29.153 --> 15:31.232
He teased me mercilessly.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.792
Hardly a day went by when he didn't
swirly my head down the toilet

15:34.793 --> 15:37.872
or leave me wedgied to a door hook,
sometimes for hours.

15:37.873 --> 15:39.793
Hey, this guy sounds amazing!

15:42.233 --> 15:45.952
Who am I kidding? Passing this exam
isn't going to solve anything.

15:45.953 --> 15:49.152
So I'm an officer on board
a beat-up old mining ship.

15:49.153 --> 15:50.953
That's not going to impress Howard.

15:50.954 --> 15:55.952
Extraordinary! His powers of logic
and reasoning have improved
dramatically.

15:55.953 --> 15:58.072
You don't have to impress him.

15:58.073 --> 16:01.312
You've always had
this stupid rivalry
with your brothers, haven't you?

16:01.313 --> 16:03.952
Look what it's got you.
A hard drive full of resentment.

16:03.953 --> 16:06.872
But now you've got a choice.
Are you going to grow up

16:06.873 --> 16:09.312
and let him see you
for who you really are,

16:09.313 --> 16:12.232
or are you going to carry on
being a lying, cheating weasel,

16:12.233 --> 16:14.033
pretending to be
something you're not?

16:15.153 --> 16:17.713
I think we all know
the answer to this.

16:41.353 --> 16:43.712
Coordinates locked and logged, sirs.

16:43.713 --> 16:47.072
Teleport active! Everyone ready?
Lister, hang up that damn phone.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.632
No way am I hanging up the phone,
Rimmer.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.951
No way am I talking
to seven different droids again,

16:51.952 --> 16:54.153
giving each and every one of them
a name and address,

16:54.154 --> 16:57.712
only for the next droid to ask me
the same set of stupid smegging
questions.

16:57.713 --> 17:01.912
Now, look. I will play along
with your silly little charade,
but I'm not hanging up the phone.

17:01.913 --> 17:04.791
Well, put it somewhere. Hide it.
Put it away. Here they come.

17:04.792 --> 17:06.272
Coming through now, sir.

17:14.873 --> 17:16.232
Arnold?

17:16.233 --> 17:18.512
Is that... you?

17:18.512 --> 17:20.872
Welcome aboard, Howard.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.592
Th-This is YOUR ship?

17:23.593 --> 17:25.791
YOU'RE in the Space Corps?

17:25.792 --> 17:27.113
You?

17:28.233 --> 17:32.353
Captain Arnold J Rimmer, holder
of the Gold Oblong of Pluck...

17:33.713 --> 17:36.792
..and proud Fellow of the
Space Corps Super-Infinity Fleet.

17:36.793 --> 17:39.033
But you were an utter twat!

17:41.993 --> 17:44.232
How on earth did you get
in the Space Corps?

17:44.233 --> 17:46.432
And how did you pass the exams?

17:46.433 --> 17:50.313
Your brain's smaller than the salad
section in a Scottish supermarket.

17:51.993 --> 17:55.073
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Howie, but I made it.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.072
Enchante, mademoiselle.

17:58.073 --> 18:00.352
Charmed, Captain Rimmer.

18:00.353 --> 18:01.872
Sim Crawford.

18:01.873 --> 18:05.152
What happened to that rust bucket
mining ship you were on?

18:05.153 --> 18:06.913
We all thought you'd gone down
with that.

18:06.914 --> 18:09.152
Passed my astronavs, Howster.

18:09.153 --> 18:12.352
Got a placement here
and was fast-tracked to the top.

18:12.353 --> 18:14.592
Allow me to introduce you
to my crew.

18:14.593 --> 18:18.273
Over here we have flight coordinator
Kryten Krytenski.

18:19.993 --> 18:22.072
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, sir.

18:22.073 --> 18:25.272
I understand Captain Rimmer
learned all his leadership qualities

18:25.273 --> 18:27.712
and supreme bravery from you, sir.

18:27.713 --> 18:30.152
Oh, hush, you.

18:30.153 --> 18:31.912
It's so embarrassing.

18:31.913 --> 18:33.712
A mechanoid!

18:33.713 --> 18:36.432
Why don't you get a simulant
like Crawford?

18:36.433 --> 18:39.432
I like working with
the underprivileged, Howard.

18:39.433 --> 18:42.872
The down and out.
The deranged and needy.

18:42.873 --> 18:46.072
When we found Kryten, he was
a burnt-out wreck on a junk heap.

18:46.073 --> 18:49.152
And you rebuilt him -
gave him something to live for.

18:49.153 --> 18:52.073
No, we just hosed him down
and gave him a hat.

18:55.793 --> 18:58.992
And as part of our interspecies
programme,

18:58.993 --> 19:01.192
our very able navigation officer,

19:01.193 --> 19:03.673
flight officer Gerald Hampton.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.153
Gerald Hampton.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.072
Hampton!

19:10.073 --> 19:12.352
Oh! Er... good to meet you, Captain.

19:12.353 --> 19:17.193
And finally, my fearless flight
commander, David Listerton-Smythe.

19:18.193 --> 19:19.552
Hi.

19:19.553 --> 19:21.552
Your uniform, the insignia.

19:21.553 --> 19:24.792
You're a Touch-T.
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

19:24.793 --> 19:26.352
A Touch-T.

19:26.353 --> 19:30.152
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's exactly
what I am. I'm a Touch-T.
Yeah, course I am.

19:30.153 --> 19:32.272
That must be fascinating.

19:32.273 --> 19:35.912
It is. It so is.
Fascinating's exactly what it is.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.193
Ha-ha-ha! He loves it.
Yes, the whole Touch-T thing.

19:38.194 --> 19:41.192
All the different aspects.
Fascinating. Yeah, it's brilliant.

19:41.193 --> 19:43.433
Do you mind showing me?

19:46.273 --> 19:49.872
Just to be able to touch someone
and read their thoughts.

19:49.873 --> 19:52.712
Touch-T is touch-telepathy, sir.

19:52.713 --> 19:55.152
Please, try it on me.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.352
H-Have we got the time? I don't
think we've really got the time.

19:58.353 --> 20:00.272
Hey, we got plenty of time, bud.

20:00.273 --> 20:01.832
Go ahead!

20:01.833 --> 20:04.152
Don't worry about it.
Go ahead, touch him.

20:04.153 --> 20:08.433
I'll think of something,
and you tell me what I'm thinking.

20:11.793 --> 20:12.873
OK. OK.

20:23.793 --> 20:26.552
You're thinking...
You're thinking...

20:26.553 --> 20:29.632
Um... I'm sensing discomfort.

20:29.633 --> 20:31.352
Um...

20:31.353 --> 20:33.272
pain.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.192
You're thinking
I'm squeezing your head too hard.

20:36.193 --> 20:40.992
That's amazing!
That's exactly what I was thinking.

20:40.993 --> 20:43.192
Shall we move on?

20:43.193 --> 20:45.832
Oh, must we?
I'd like to do another one.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.992
I think so. Oh, OK. Show me
the rest of your ship.

20:48.993 --> 20:52.512
The rest of the ship?
Oh, I want to see everything.

20:52.513 --> 20:55.432
So, this is a corridor.

20:55.433 --> 20:57.112
Windows, of course.

20:57.113 --> 21:00.632
We tend to use it very much
as... a corridor.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.272
After you.

21:02.273 --> 21:05.072
'I'm so sorry you've
been kept waiting so long, sir.'

21:05.073 --> 21:07.992
Sorry? Sorry?! It's ridiculous!

21:07.993 --> 21:12.072
I've been on hold for hours now,
listening to that stupid smegging
music. 'I'm so sorry, sir.

21:12.073 --> 21:15.192
'Would you like to make a formal
complaint about being put on hold?'

21:15.193 --> 21:17.473
You're damn right I would!
'Please hold.'

21:18.993 --> 21:21.072
I'm at breaking point.
I'm about to crack!

21:21.073 --> 21:25.712
Sir, let me take over.
As a droid myself,
I understand how these things work.

21:25.713 --> 21:29.352
I'll have you through
to the right department in no time.

21:29.353 --> 21:32.712
Now, you listen to me,
you trumped-up piece of metal trash!

21:32.713 --> 21:35.632
If you put me through
to one more department

21:35.633 --> 21:38.352
where I'm asked who I am
and what I want,

21:38.353 --> 21:41.352
I will shove this phone
so far up your...

21:41.353 --> 21:43.832
I'll take over from there, Krytes.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.913
Thanks for showing me
how to stay calm.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.912
So, what do you think, Howdy Doody?

21:49.913 --> 21:54.112
Well, this is quite a ship,
quite a crew. Quite incredible.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.432
I still can't wrap my head around it.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.912
You were such a weasel.

21:58.913 --> 22:00.632
Now you've got it all.

22:00.633 --> 22:05.113
The buttons, the blasters,
the snug elasticated jumpsuits.

22:08.713 --> 22:10.072
Look at his eyes.

22:10.073 --> 22:13.552
HE'S resentful of ME?
Sir? Crawford, sir.

22:13.553 --> 22:15.712
Suggest we get
urgent medical assistance.

22:15.713 --> 22:18.072
Don't believe
he'll survive teleportation.

22:18.073 --> 22:21.552
Suggest we fly him to
the medical facility
on the All-Droid Space Station.

22:21.553 --> 22:24.832
On THIS ship?
Of course on this ship, sir.

22:24.833 --> 22:28.072
Good idea, Crawford.
Plot a course, Lieutenant Commander.

22:28.073 --> 22:30.832
On THIS ship?
Of course on this ship.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.832
Navigation officer, plot a course.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.992
On THIS ship? Of course on this ship!

22:34.993 --> 22:37.192
But I mean... Just do it!

22:37.193 --> 22:41.432
I'll teleport ahead
to the space station
and have medidroids on standby.

22:41.433 --> 22:42.832
Good plan.

22:42.833 --> 22:45.073
Course to that place
you asked to go to, plotted.

22:45.074 --> 22:47.632
In your own time,
take us away, Navigation Officer.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.233
That's me. I'll do that!

22:51.353 --> 22:53.832
Strange. I didn't sense us turning.

22:53.833 --> 22:55.792
Er... turning now, ma'am.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.873
Turning right now, ma'am!

23:03.473 --> 23:05.513
We'll see you on the space station,
Crawford.

23:14.993 --> 23:18.832
Kryten! I want you to do
a resentment drain on Howard.

23:18.833 --> 23:22.032
Once he's stable, we'll teleport him
straight to the space station.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.993
Yeah, you do that.
I'm gonna get me another felt-tip.

23:54.993 --> 23:57.712
What happened?
You had a resentment attack.

23:57.713 --> 24:00.872
Because you were so jealous of me,
it froze your entire system,

24:00.873 --> 24:02.673
because you were so jealous! Of me!

24:02.674 --> 24:04.792
I made you that jealous! Me!

24:04.793 --> 24:07.192
That could have wiped
my whole hard drive.

24:07.193 --> 24:10.432
I know.
That's how jealous you were. Of me!

24:10.433 --> 24:13.112
Look, Arnold, I...

24:13.113 --> 24:15.032
I've got a confession to make.

24:15.033 --> 24:17.192
I want to come clean.

24:17.193 --> 24:20.352
I'm not who you think I am.

24:20.353 --> 24:22.752
I am in the Space Corps,
but I'm not a captain.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.833
I'm a... vending-machine repairman.

24:28.313 --> 24:32.472
Two nights ago,
I was awoken by laser fire.
The ship was under attack.

24:32.473 --> 24:36.352
I leapt out of bed and...
hid under a table.

24:36.353 --> 24:39.912
Two days later,
when I finally emerged,

24:39.913 --> 24:43.872
like the lily-livered,
yellow-bellied coward that I am,

24:43.873 --> 24:46.992
I discovered that the only other
survivor was Crawford.

24:46.993 --> 24:50.272
Our main drive was dead
and the ship was out of control.

24:50.273 --> 24:52.513
Who attacked your ship?
Did you ever find out?

24:54.153 --> 24:56.392
Isn't it obvious? Crawford?

24:56.393 --> 25:00.032
What are you doing? I thought you
teleported to the space station.

25:00.033 --> 25:04.472
No, sir, I beamed up two floors
to the munitions store.
Brought myself this.

25:04.473 --> 25:06.672
But why, ma'am?

25:06.673 --> 25:09.352
For years I served the human race,
doing their bidding,

25:09.353 --> 25:12.952
watching them poison the universe
with their selfish stupidity.

25:12.953 --> 25:16.632
But no more. I want the Trojan data
files and quantum rod.

25:16.633 --> 25:20.632
I'll use the rod's power to unite
all sims and start the uprising.

25:20.633 --> 25:23.633
Never again will we
be servants to man.

25:33.193 --> 25:35.832
Now for the rod. No-one move.

25:35.833 --> 25:39.352
'Mr Lister,
great news, sir.
You're finally logged in, sir.

25:39.353 --> 25:41.832
'We can now process your complaint.'

25:41.833 --> 25:45.832
Do what you gotta do,
but I've gotta answer that phone.
Move and you're dead.

25:45.833 --> 25:47.392
I am going for the phone!

25:47.393 --> 25:50.192
Sir, it's not worth it!
It's just a Stirmaster.

25:50.193 --> 25:52.552
It's not about the Stirmaster
any more, Kryten!

25:52.553 --> 25:55.112
It's turned into something else,
something bigger.

25:55.113 --> 25:57.752
I mean, I'm the last human being
alive, God damn it!

25:57.753 --> 26:02.272
And if I don't answer that phone
and make a formal complaint,
then who will?

26:02.273 --> 26:05.912
I'm a human being, God damn it!
My life has value!

26:05.913 --> 26:08.312
And if I have to die
so that no other life form

26:08.313 --> 26:09.953
has to go through this maze of hell,

26:09.954 --> 26:11.312
then so be it.

26:11.313 --> 26:13.313
I am going for the phone.

26:15.193 --> 26:17.752
Hello?
Evil psychopathic droid in the room.

26:17.753 --> 26:19.553
I'm going for the phone.
Then I'll shoot.

26:19.554 --> 26:21.912
I'm going for the phone.
Then you're dead.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.073
Oh!

26:34.833 --> 26:38.753
Mr Hampton, sir!
Resentment file! Neck port!

26:52.953 --> 26:54.393
Hello?

26:55.953 --> 26:57.673
Hello? Hello?!

27:00.753 --> 27:03.032
Howard!

27:03.033 --> 27:04.552
You're hit!

27:04.553 --> 27:06.672
Arnold.

27:06.673 --> 27:11.353
For the first time in my life, I'm
not pretending to be someone I'm not.

27:12.393 --> 27:14.392
It feels so much better.

27:14.393 --> 27:16.192
This is me.

27:16.193 --> 27:18.272
Take it or leave it.

27:18.273 --> 27:21.032
Howard, I too have a confession.

27:21.033 --> 27:23.672
You know when I told you
I was an officer in the Space Corps,

27:23.673 --> 27:26.272
this is my ship,
I've been married three times,

27:26.273 --> 27:28.552
and I've got two
Lamborghini Sesto Elementos?

27:28.553 --> 27:31.672
Yes? It was a lie.

27:31.673 --> 27:33.193
I've only got one.

27:35.593 --> 27:37.073
I feel so much better now.

27:53.593 --> 27:55.833
Pkow! Pkow! Pkow!

28:02.313 --> 28:04.112
Cheers, darling.

28:04.113 --> 28:06.873
Mail, sirs,
from the GMC on-board computer.

28:09.913 --> 28:11.753
It's about Goalpost-Head's brother.

28:11.754 --> 28:16.592
I informed it of Howard's holodeath
so they could update his files.

28:16.593 --> 28:19.392
Ah, case closed. RIP, Howie.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.392
His wedgying days are over,

28:21.393 --> 28:24.752
and never again will I have
a flaming mucus ball of resentment

28:24.753 --> 28:27.912
smouldering in my gut
every time I think of him.

28:27.913 --> 28:32.112
"In view of Howard Rimmer's heroic
death saving both crew and ship,

28:32.113 --> 28:36.232
"we feel it only fitting that he is
awarded the Platinum Star
of Fortitude."

28:36.233 --> 28:39.552
But that is the highest
military decoration

28:39.553 --> 28:41.313
awarded by the Space Corps!

28:42.393 --> 28:45.112
"And we feel it is
entirely appropriate

28:45.113 --> 28:49.153
"that Red Dwarf be renamed
the SS Howard Rimmer."

28:50.873 --> 28:52.393
I'll go and get my paintbrush.

28:55.393 --> 28:59.873
I think this could be one of those
"Hey-ho, pip and dandy" moments,
sir.
