00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
DID A VISUAL CHECK OF THE HOUSE,

00:47.700 --> 00:50.300
SAW WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A BODY
ON THE DOWNSTAIRS FLOOR.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.700
FINDING ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS
LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE,

00:54.700 --> 00:55.900
WE WAITED FOR BACKUP.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.200

01:17.900 --> 01:20.400

ARE YOU?
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.500
ALL THIS CAME
FROM THIS LITTLE GIRL'S HEART,

03:33.500 --> 03:35.200
AND I CAN'T SAY
THAT IT'S BLOOD?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.800
JUST ONE SECOND, OKAY?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.900
SERGEANT GABRIEL,
I KNOW I ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE,

03:38.900 --> 03:41.200
BUT COULD YOU PLEASE
FIND THE PATROL OFFICER

03:41.200 --> 03:42.600
AND GET THE PHONE NUMBER

03:42.600 --> 03:44.800

03:50.600 --> 03:53.800
AND ONE OFF AND CHARGING

03:57.000 --> 03:58.600
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK

HANK YOU.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.900
LOOK, LIEUTENANT,
I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD,

04:05.900 --> 04:08.400
BUT WE ARE FILMING
THIS CRIME SCENE FOR THE COURT.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.900
IF YOU CALL ONE LITTLE SPOT
"BLOOD" THAT ISN'T BLOOD --

04:10.900 --> 04:13.300
AND I CAN'T EDIT THIS,
SO...

04:17.200 --> 04:18.000
OKAY.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.200
THE VICTIM IS 12
AND IN HER PAJAMAS.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.800
SO MAYBE SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS

04:24.800 --> 04:26.900
TO SEE WHAT
ALL THE SCREAMING WAS ABOUT.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.000
THERE ARE THREE
VISIBLE WOUNDS --

04:30.000 --> 04:32.300
ONE IN THE BACK,
ONE IN THE CHEST,

04:32.300 --> 04:33.400
AND ONE IN THE THROAT.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.000
WOULD YOU DOCUMENT THAT,
PLEASE?

04:35.000 --> 04:35.900
YES, MA'AM.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.900
THERE'S A LETTER OPENER
HERE IN THE SINK.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.900
NOW, THIS MIGHT BE
FROM THE BLOTTER SET

04:48.900 --> 04:50.500
ON THE DESK DOWNSTAIRS.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.600
NOW, OVER HERE --

04:51.600 --> 04:53.900
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF
FOR THE COURT.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.500
OH, FOR CRYING OUT --

04:55.500 --> 04:57.900
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
PRIORITY HOMICIDE.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.600
NOW, RECORD ALL THIS HERE, TOO.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.500
YOU CAN SEE WHAT MIGHT BE BLOOD
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.400
WE THINK THAT WHOEVER
KILLED THE WALLACES

05:08.400 --> 05:11.400
CAME UP HERE
AND TOOK A SHOWER AFTER.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.100
HELLO, THERE.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.800
I'M LIEUTENANT MICHAEL TAO,

05:18.800 --> 05:22.300
PRIORITY HOMICIDE DIVISION
OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.700
NOW, IF YOU'LL COME WITH ME.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.500
I FOUND THESE CLOTHES
IN THE WASHER.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.900
THEY HAVE A RED SUBSTANCE
ON THEM, PERHAPS BLOOD.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.500
UM, THIS WAY.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.300
IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT
THE VICTIMS' 17-YEAR-OLD SON,

05:44.300 --> 05:48.600
ERIC DEAN WALLACE,
IS NOT HOME AT 4:33 A.M.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.400
AND HIS ROOM
HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED,

05:50.800 --> 05:54.100
DESPITE HAVING A LOT OF HIGH-END
MERCHANDISE LYING AROUND.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.200
OH, AND THE SHOES FROM
THE WASHER ARE THE SAME SIZE

05:57.200 --> 06:00.300
AS THE SHOES ON THIS FLOOR,
RIGHT HERE.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.000
BUZZ, DOWNSTAIRS. OUT.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.000
Backup. Now.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
Man: GET DOWN
ON YOUR STOMACH!

06:34.400 --> 06:36.300
Man: DON'T MOVE, GUYS.
BACK. BACK. BACK.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.

06:41.200 --> 06:41.900
PLEASE.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.600
GET UP.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.000
I'M ERIC DEAN WALLACE.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.000
I WANT TO
SEE MY MOM AND DAD.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.200
I WANT TO SEE THEM,
PLEASE.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.300
I UNDERSTAND THAT, HONEY.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.200
THAT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.400
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED?

07:02.800 --> 07:06.500
I WOKE UP, AND I WAS GOING
DOWNSTAIRS

07:06.500 --> 07:07.800
TO GET A DRINK OF WATER.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.600
AND...
I GOT TO THE STAIRS.

07:10.700 --> 07:11.700
MM-HMM?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.500
JENNY --
SHE WAS JUST LYING THERE.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.700
WAS THERE ANYONE VISITING
YOUR HOUSE THIS EVENING?

07:20.700 --> 07:21.500
NO.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.500
DID YOU HEAR A DOORBELL
OR A KNOCK OR --

07:24.500 --> 07:25.200
NO.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.800
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT
WANT TO HURT YOUR FAMILY?

07:30.300 --> 07:32.500
MY DAD WORKS
WITH SOME CONVICTS.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.400
MM-HMM?

07:33.400 --> 07:35.800
HE WORKS FOR THE FEDERAL PRISON
UP TERMINAL ISLAND

07:35.800 --> 07:38.800
AND THE ONE
UP AT LOMPOC, TOO.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.000
HE'S --
HE'S A SOCIOLOGIST.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.300
OKAY.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.900
OKAY, SWEETHEART.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.900
OKAY, NOW.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.800
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.400
THEY'RE GONNA TREAT YOU
FOR SHOCK, OKAY?

07:56.700 --> 07:58.600
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU, OKAY?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.500
ALL RIGHT.
BLESS YOUR HEART.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.200
OKAY.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.100
SERGEANT GABRIEL HERE
IS GONNA RIDE WITH YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
I'LL GO WITH HIM,
CHIEF.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.800
NO, YOU WON'T,
LIEUTENANT.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.600
ALL RIGHT,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

08:15.500 --> 08:18.200
THAT BOY HAD PUPILS
THE SIZE OF SAUCERS.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.000
I'D LIKE YOU TO GET A WARRANT
SO WE CAN CHECK HIS BLOOD

08:21.000 --> 08:23.500
FOR DRUGS WHEN HE GETS
TO THE HOSPITAL, PLEASE.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.000
AND, LIEUTENANT FLYNN, SINCE YOU
SEEM TO BE IN THE MOOD,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.500
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET THE PATROL OFFICERS

08:29.500 --> 08:31.100
WHO SAID
THIS HOUSE WAS CLEARED.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.000
GIVE THEM A PIECE
OF MY MIND, OKAY?

08:33.100 --> 08:33.700
YOU GOT IT.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.799
THANK YOU.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.000
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA...

08:40.200 --> 08:41.900
UM...PLEASE SUPERVISE
THE SEARCH WARRANT.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.700
THE KILLER
WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.900
MAYBE HE DIDN'T FIND IT.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.100
THANK YOU.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.200
HEY, DON'T FORGET
YOU HAVE A MEETING

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
WITH CHIEF POPE
AT 10:00 A.M.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.600
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.400
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.400
SHOOT!

09:04.900 --> 09:06.700
Pope:
AND NO MORE OVERTIME.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.400
HOW CAN THERE BE
NO OVERTIME?

09:09.700 --> 09:10.900
WHAT IF MY VICTIMS
DON'T DIE

09:10.900 --> 09:12.700
BETWEEN 8:00 AND 4:00
IN THE AFTERNOON?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.900
LOOK, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE APPROVAL PROCESS

09:14.900 --> 09:17.600
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING DURING
THIS TIME OF FINANCIAL CRISIS,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.800
WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA, NOT BY ME.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.400
IS THAT WHY MY REQUEST FOR
EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK WAS DENIED?

09:23.400 --> 09:24.400
WHAT BLOOD WORK?

09:24.400 --> 09:27.300
I HAVE A BOY IN THE HOSPITAL,
ERIC WALLACE,

09:27.300 --> 09:28.600
AND EARLY THIS MORNING,

09:28.600 --> 09:31.200
HIS ENTIRE FAMILY WAS FOUND
STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR HOUSE,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.400
AND THE BOY, UP IN THE ATTIC,
HIGH AS A KITE.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.800
SO YOU OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT
AND DRAW THE BOY'S BLOOD.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.100
WE DID THAT, WILL.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.200
AND NOW DETECTIVE SANCHEZ
TELLS ME --

09:41.200 --> 09:43.700
BECAUSE IT WOULD COST
AN EXTRA DOLLAR OR SOMETHING --

09:43.700 --> 09:46.900
THAT MY REQUEST TO TEST
THE BOY'S BLOOD FOR INTOXICANTS WAS DENIED.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.500
IT'S NOT DENIED.
IT'S DELAYED.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.000
YOU'LL HAVE
THE RESULTS TOMORROW MORNING.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.400
TOMORROW, THAT BOY CAN HAVE
AN ATTORNEY APPOINTED FOR HIM

09:52.400 --> 09:53.500
BY CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.900
I NEED THAT BLOOD WORK,
AND I NEED IT RIGHT NOW.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.200
CONSIDER JUST FOR A MOMENT

09:58.200 --> 10:02.300
A UNIVERSE
IN WHICH <i>YOU</i> WORK FOR <i>ME</i>

10:02.300 --> 10:05.000
AND WHAT I NEED
IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'LL DO THAT
AFTER YOU CONSIDER

10:07.000 --> 10:08.900
GETTING OUT OF BED
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING

10:09.500 --> 10:11.000
AND EXAMINING
A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL

10:11.000 --> 10:12.400
WHO'S BEEN
STABBED THROUGH THE HEART.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.000
WHAT ABOUT HER NEEDS, WILL?
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

10:19.300 --> 10:21.800
BUT SO IS LOSING 6%
OF OUR BUDGET

10:21.800 --> 10:25.500
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BEEFING UP
OUR COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.900
IT'S NOT JUST, UH,
HALTING EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.700
EVERY SECTION HAS TO LOSE
AT LEAST ONE DETECTIVE.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.600
YOU DON'T MEAN MINE.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.600
YES, I DO MEAN YOURS, BRENDA.
EVERY SECTION.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.900
WHO WOULD I LET GO?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.400
COME ON.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO.

10:43.000 --> 10:43.900
NO.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.300
SIX MONTHS AGO, PROVENZA
LEFT HIS GUN IN HIS DESK DRAWER.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.000
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
WAS CLEARED OF ALL --

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
NO, HE WAS NOT CLEARED.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.800
HEY, WE HAVE ALL
LEFT OUR GUNS.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.300
YOURS IS IN YOUR DRAWER
RIGHT NOW.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.000
OKAY?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.200
MM-HMM.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.200
LISTEN, I CAN'T
FIND THE SAVINGS I NEED,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.200
EXCEPT BY LOSING
AND/OR TRANSFERRING PERSONNEL.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.600
YOU MUST -- <i>MUST --</i>
SEND SOMEONE FROM YOUR TEAM

11:14.600 --> 11:17.700
TO COUNTERTERRORISM
OR TALK PROVENZA INTO RETIRING.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.800
WHICH IS THE BETTER SOLUTION?
IT'S OBVIOUS.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.700
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE YOU AGREE WITH ME?

11:21.700 --> 11:23.000
STOP BEING WRONG.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.300
LOOK, I'LL PAY FOR
THE EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK MYSELF,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.400
BUT MY TEAM STAYS PUT.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.600
NO, BRENDA, NO DEAL.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.700
I'LL FIND THE SAVINGS
SOME OTHER WAY.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.800
YEAH,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
THANK YOU.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.400
THE ONLY OTHER THING
I FOUND AT THE HOUSE,

11:43.400 --> 11:46.000
OTHER THAN
ERIC'S DRUG STASH HERE,

11:46.100 --> 11:48.300
WAS THAT THE GARAGE DOOR
WAS OPEN

11:48.400 --> 11:52.500
AND THE WALLACES' VEHICLE
HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.000
UH...OKAY.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.100
SO, THE KILLER WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.500
IT MAY HAVE BELONGED
TO MR. WALLACE,

12:02.500 --> 12:04.700
BUT WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.500
UM, LIEUTENANT TAO,

12:08.500 --> 12:10.200
HOW ARE WE DOING
WITH OUR MURDER WEAPON?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.800
Tao: OH, UM...

12:13.600 --> 12:15.500
WIPED CLEAN.
NO PRINTS.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.000
PRELIMINARY TIME OF DEATH
FOR ALL VICTIMS

12:19.000 --> 12:21.100
BETWEEN 11:00 AND 12:45.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
AND I SENT THE BLOODY CLOTHES
FROM THE WASHING MACHINE

12:24.100 --> 12:25.400
TO THE LAB FOR TESTING.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.000
DETECTIVE DANIELS,
CELLPHONES, LAPTOPS?

12:28.100 --> 12:29.400
ALL ACCOUNTED FOR.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.100
OKAY. LIEUTENANT FLYNN?

12:31.900 --> 12:34.700
YOU REALLY WANT BACKGROUND
ON THIS FAMILY? WHY?

12:35.100 --> 12:36.900
THE WEAPON CAME
FROM INSIDE.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.700
EVERY DOOR WAS BOLTED.
EVERY WINDOW WAS LOCKED.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.400
OKAY, SO MAYBE THE MURDERS
WEREN'T PREMEDITATED.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.900
BUT THE SON DID IT.
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SON DID IT.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.900
Daniels: AND ERIC
LIED ABOUT HIS FATHER, TOO.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.600
WALLACE DIDN'T WORK
AT EITHER

12:49.600 --> 12:52.400
THE FEDERAL PRISON ON TERMINAL
ISLAND, NOR UP IN LOMPOC.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.700
WHY WOULD ERIC LIE
ABOUT WHERE HIS FATHER WORKED?

12:54.700 --> 12:56.000
THE KID WAS ON "X."

12:56.000 --> 12:59.800
OH, AND YOU OWE ME $150
FOR THIS EXPEDITED BLOOD WORK.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.800
ERIC IS SEDATED.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.100
BUT THIS, UH,
BITCH-Y E.R. NURSE

13:07.100 --> 13:09.900
GOT ALL WHACKED OUT
OVER ERIC MAYBE BEING A KILLER

13:09.900 --> 13:12.300
AND HOW THE HOSPITAL
IS NOT A DETENTION CENTER.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.100
SO NOW THEY WON'T HOLD HIM
AFTER HE COMES TO.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.300
I MEAN,
YOU GOT MAYBE FIVE HOURS.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.400
THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.100
Brenda:
OKAY, FIVE HOURS.

13:23.100 --> 13:27.700
UM, OKAY,
UM...LIEUTENANT TAO,

13:27.700 --> 13:30.100
IF YOU COULD
PLEASE GET PHONE DUMPS

13:30.100 --> 13:32.700
FOR THE WALLACES' CELLPHONES
AND LANDLINES.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.600
THANK YOU.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
AND, LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
IF YOU COULD

13:36.000 --> 13:37.600
TAKE OUR MURDER WEAPON
OVER TO THE MORGUE

13:37.600 --> 13:40.400
AND HAVE DR. CRIPPEN MATCH IT
AGAINST THE WOUNDS.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.400
DETECTIVE DANIELS, FOLLOW UP
ON THAT TERMINAL ISLAND

13:43.400 --> 13:44.700
AND LOMPOC CONNECTION,
PLEASE.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.900
IF MR. WALLACE
DIDN'T WORK THERE,

13:45.900 --> 13:48.300
HE MIGHT BE ON
THE PRISONS' VISITORS LISTS.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.900
OKAY, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
IF YOU COULD PLEASE

13:53.900 --> 13:55.700
GATHER EVERYONE'S REPORTS

13:55.700 --> 13:58.400
AND BRING THEM OVER TO ME
AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
THANK YOU.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.300
OH, AND, UH,
SINCE IT'S SATURDAY,

14:04.300 --> 14:09.300
UM, IF Y'ALL COULD SIGN OUT
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

14:09.300 --> 14:11.200
UM, STARTING
WITH DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

14:11.900 --> 14:14.300
'CAUSE WE HAVE TO PINCH
THOSE PENNIES WHERE WE CAN.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.000
THANK YOU. THANKS.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.300
WHAT IN THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

14:21.800 --> 14:24.500
DO YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND BUDGET CUTS?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.900
WHAT BUDGET CUTS?

14:25.900 --> 14:27.300
THE MEMO'S ON YOUR DESK.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.600
EVERY DEPARTMENT'S
LOSING A DETECTIVE.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.600
AND FLYNN'S ACTING LIKE
HE WANTS TO BE THE SHORT STRAW.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
I'M NOT THE ONE ELIGIBLE
FOR RETIREMENT HERE.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.100
WELL, LET'S --
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.800
TIME IS MONEY, FOLKS.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.400
TIME IS MONEY.

15:09.100 --> 15:09.900
Fritz: HEY.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.500
ARE YOU COMING TO LOOK
AT THESE OPEN HOUSES...

15:12.500 --> 15:13.700
Shh!

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
...OR NOT?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.000
I KNOW THAT THE PRISONS
ARE FEDERAL PROPERTY,

15:18.000 --> 15:18.900
BUT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

15:18.900 --> 15:20.900
LET US LOOK
AT THEIR VISITORS LISTS.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.800
UH, WELL,
ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE,

15:23.800 --> 15:26.600
MAYBE I CAN GET THE FBI TO HURRY
THOSE LISTS ALONG FOR US.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.000
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.700
THANK YOU. BYE.

15:32.700 --> 15:37.600
SO, I HAVE
THIS MURDER SUSPECT...

15:39.700 --> 15:42.000
...TELLING ME
THAT HIS FATHER

15:42.000 --> 15:44.300
WORKS
AT THE FEDERAL PRISONS

15:44.300 --> 15:47.000
AT TERMINAL ISLAND
AND UP AT LOMPOC.

15:47.300 --> 15:50.200
BUT BOTH PRISONS SAY THEY NEVER
HEARD OF THE FATHER AT ALL.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.900
LOOKS BAD FOR THE SON.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.300
AND IN ORDER TO EXAMINE
THE PRISONS' VISITORS LISTS,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.300
WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER
INDIVIDUAL WARRANTS.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.700
HOWEVER, IF A VERY SPECIAL
AGENT OF THE FBI

16:02.700 --> 16:04.300
WERE TO CALL AND ASK --

16:04.300 --> 16:05.300
NO PROBLEM.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.800
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

16:07.900 --> 16:13.000
IS FILL OUT THESE FORMS
REQUESTING OUR ASSISTANCE,

16:13.100 --> 16:15.400
AND I CAN HAND IT IN
TO OUR OFFICE ON MONDAY.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.900
COULDN'T
YOU JUST CALL AND --

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
(DESK)

16:19.900 --> 16:23.000
THAT WAS ON MY DESK
ALL DAY FRIDAY.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.000
YEAH, PEOPLE KEPT STOPPING BY,
BURSTING OUT LAUGHING.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.300
ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.500
THIS THING IS JUST --
IT'S AWFUL.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT MY WORK TODAY?

16:39.400 --> 16:42.600
POPE ANNOUNCED CUTBACKS,
INCLUDING, LIKE, IN PERSONNEL.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.500
OH.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.600
AND HE TOOK AWAY
OUR OVERTIME.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.800
WELL, THAT'S NUTS.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.500
WHAT IF PEOPLE
GET MURDERED AT NIGHT?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.600
EXACTLY.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
AND ALL THIS PAPERWORK,

16:53.700 --> 16:56.800
HONEY, IT WILL TAKE HOURS
TO FILL OUT.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.900
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.000
SO, ARE YOU COMING
WITH ME TODAY OR NOT?

17:02.300 --> 17:04.900
OH, I-I HAVE TO PUT THAT OFF
AT LEAST UNTIL TOMORROW,

17:04.900 --> 17:05.900
BECAUSE --

17:07.099 --> 17:08.599
HEY! HEY!

17:08.599 --> 17:09.599
WHAT A MINUTE.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.200
YOU ARE BEING COMPLETELY
UNFAIR ABOUT THIS.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.200
I HAVE A MURDER
TO INVESTIGATE.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.700
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A MURDER.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.099
AND, YOU KNOW,
I LIKE THIS HOUSE.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.099
IT'S COMFORTABLE.
IT'S DONE.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.099
YOU ARE
ALWAYS RUSHING ME.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.900
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
WIN THIS ARGUMENT?

17:23.900 --> 17:26.300
THERE IS NO PLACE
FOR MY STUFF HERE

17:26.300 --> 17:27.300
OR TO SET UP AN OFFICE

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
OR TO HAVE OVERNIGHT GUESTS,
LIKE OUR PARENTS.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.300
WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE
MY FATHER COME HERE ANYWAY.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.000
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU'VE MOVED IN.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.300
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T
MOVED IN, NOW, HAVE I?

17:37.100 --> 17:41.200
ALMOST EVERYTHING I OWN
IS STILL IN THE GARAGE!

17:42.500 --> 17:46.200
NOW, DO YOU WANT THE VISITORS
LISTS TO THE PRISONS

17:46.200 --> 17:48.400
AT LOMPOC AND TERMINAL ISLAND
OR NOT?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.800
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME

17:50.800 --> 17:52.000
WITH MY MURDER INVESTIGATION

17:52.000 --> 17:53.700
BECAUSE I CAN'T GO
HOUSE HUNTING WITH YOU TODAY?

17:53.700 --> 17:54.600
???

17:54.600 --> 17:56.700
YEAH, GOOD. I DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.600
WELL, I REFUSE TO STAND HERE
AND HAGGLE WITH YOU,

18:00.900 --> 18:04.100
AS IF WE'RE TRADING TRINKETS
IN SOME BAZAAR.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.400
GOOD. BYE.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.100
IF I SEE SOMETHING I LIKE,
I'LL TAKE PICTURES.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.100
Gabriel: BECAUSE MR. WALLACE
WAS AN ORPHAN.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.500
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE ORPHANS?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.800
SHE'S MAD BECAUSE
ERIC'S FATHER HAD NO PARENTS.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.800
HIS MOTHER WAS AN ONLY CHILD,
PARENTS DECEASED,

18:23.800 --> 18:26.100
SO WE HAVE NO RELATIVE
TO RELEASE THE KID TO.

18:26.900 --> 18:27.600
[ COFFEE MACHINE BUZZES ]
OH!

18:27.900 --> 18:30.100
CONSIDERING HOW THE KID
TREATS HIS NEXT OF KIN,

18:30.100 --> 18:31.200
IT'S PROBABLY BEST.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.100
I HAVE SOME --
CHIEF, CHIEF, PLEASE.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.000
PLEASE. HERE. LET ME.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.700
ANYWAY, UNLESS ERIC
TURNS OUT TO BE SUICIDAL,

18:40.700 --> 18:43.800
WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
BASED UPON THE WAY HE JUST ATE,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.500
THE HOSPITAL SAYS
WE EITHER HAVE TO ARREST HIM,

18:45.500 --> 18:47.300
OR THEY'RE GONNA RELEASE HIM
TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES,

18:47.300 --> 18:49.000
WHICH TAKES HIM
OUT OF OUR CUSTODY.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.900
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE YET
TO BOOK HIM FOR MURDER.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.800
WELL, WE HAVE HIM
ON DRUG POSSESSION.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.900
NO. ARREST, LAWYER,
THE END.

18:58.100 --> 18:58.900
HMM.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.200
SO I NEED A SUICIDE WATCH
OR A CONFESSION.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.900
I KNOW MR. WALLACE
DIDN'T WORK IN PRISONS.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.800
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING HERE
ABOUT HOW HE MADE HIS INCOME.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.400
NO, IT'S ALL SMALL AMOUNTS

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
FROM ARTICLES HE PUBLISHED
IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
HERE YOU GO, CHIEF.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.200
MRS. WALLACE WAS THE ONE
WITH THE MONEY.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.600
HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.

19:22.100 --> 19:26.300
SHE, UH, PULLED IN
$900,000 A YEAR

19:26.300 --> 19:28.900
ON HER MUTUAL FUNDS,
TAX-FREE.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.600
PLUS, SHE HAD DIVIDENDS

19:30.600 --> 19:33.900
OFF $30 MILLION
WORTH OF OIL STOCK.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.900
HMM. NOW,
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.100
GUESS WHO THE WALLACES'
BENEFICIARIES ARE.

19:41.100 --> 19:41.900
THEIR CHILDREN.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.900
RECENTLY REDUCED TO ONE.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.300
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.000
YOU CAN TAKE
THE REST OF THE NIGHT OFF.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.200
WELL, I-I SIGNED OUT
WHEN I LEFT THE OFFICE.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.300
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
BEEN A CLOCK WATCHER.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.000
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.
THANKS.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.900
SO, WISH ME LUCK.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.000
BUDGET CUTS.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.900
THANKS, GUYS.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.300
IN FACT, POPE SAYS

20:14.300 --> 20:17.500
IF I CAN'T FIND SOME WAY
TO SAVE MONEY, I'LL --

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
IF YOU CAN'T FIND
SOME WAY TO SAVE MONEY, WHAT?

20:20.100 --> 20:21.800
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
MAY HAVE TO RETIRE.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.500
TESTING. 1, 2, 3.
TESTING.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.500
Brenda: <i>TESTING. 1, 2, 3.</i>
 <i>TESTING.</i>

20:28.700 --> 20:30.300
I WOKE UP.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.500
MY THROAT WAS REALLY DRY,

20:32.500 --> 20:35.200
SO I STARTED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
TO GET SOME WATER.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
AND YOU SAW
YOUR SISTER'S BODY?

20:39.500 --> 20:42.000
YES, I FOUND
MY LITTLE SISTER, JENNY.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.600
OKAY. SO YOU WALKED
OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.000
AND I YELLED
FOR MY PARENTS.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
AND NO ONE ANSWERED,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.700
SO I RAN UP TO MY ROOM
AND CALLED 911,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.500
THEN I CLIMBED
INTO THE ATTIC.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.500
DID YOU HEAR
THE POLICE ARRIVE?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.400
THERE WERE NO SIRENS
OR ANYTHING.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.100
I HEARD NOISES LATER.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.600
I COULDN'T MOVE.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.400
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
THE KILLER OR KILLERS ENTERED?

21:18.000 --> 21:18.200
NO.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.100
WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN LOOKING FOR?

21:20.100 --> 21:20.800
NO. 

21:20.800 --> 21:22.100
OR WHAT TIME
THIS ALL HAPPENED?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
I GUESS I MUST HAVE
JUST SLEPT THROUGH IT.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.600
SEE, ERIC, I JUST -- I FIND THAT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.100
WHY?

21:35.000 --> 21:35.700
I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.800
OUTSIDE! OUTSIDE NOW!

21:58.800 --> 22:00.300
NO!!!

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
STOP.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.300
AHHHHH!

22:14.600 --> 22:16.300
THAT IS THE MIXTURE
OF SOUNDS

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
THAT THE HUMAN BODY MAKES

22:18.500 --> 22:21.000
WHEN SOMEONE
SHOVES A KNIFE IN IT.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.400
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT YOUR PARENTS MADE

22:23.400 --> 22:24.800
WHEN THEY WERE BEING
STABBED TO DEATH.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.300
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT JENNY HEARD

22:26.400 --> 22:27.200
THAT MADE HER
RACE DOWNSTAIRS,

22:27.700 --> 22:30.000
JUST LIKE EVERYONE
RUSHED IN HERE RIGHT NOW.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.000
THAT'S THE SOUND
THAT JENNY MADE

22:32.000 --> 22:35.100
UNTIL THE KILLER
STABBED HER IN THE THROAT

22:35.100 --> 22:37.300
10 FEET FROM THE DOOR
OF YOUR ROOM,

22:37.300 --> 22:40.800
WHICH IS WHY I FIND IT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE

22:40.800 --> 22:42.700
THAT YOU SLEPT THROUGH IT ALL,
ESPECIALLY SINCE --

22:42.800 --> 22:44.900
ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOU WERE HIGH ON MDMA,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.200
ALSO KNOWN AS ECSTASY,
WHICH IS THE DRUG

22:47.200 --> 22:50.700
HOSPITAL TESTS CONFIRMED WERE
IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM LAST NIGHT.

22:50.700 --> 22:54.000
"X" IS KIND OF SPEEDY.
IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.600
Brenda: SO, ERIC,
WHEN I FIND A HIGH TEENAGE BOY

22:56.600 --> 22:58.000
IN THE ATTIC OF HIS HOUSE

22:59.100 --> 23:01.600
AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY'S
BEEN STABBED TO DEATH DOWNSTAIRS

23:01.600 --> 23:05.500
AND THAT BOY LIES TO BE ABOUT,
WELL, EVERYTHING,

23:05.500 --> 23:07.300
I THINK, "MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST ARREST HIM FOR MURDER

23:07.300 --> 23:07.900
AND CALL IT A DAY."

23:07.900 --> 23:10.200
NO, BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.600
OKAY, I WOULDN'T HAVE.
I COULDN'T DO IT.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.200
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
LET'S START OVER AGAIN,

23:15.200 --> 23:17.200
AND YOU CAN
TELL ME THE TRUTH THIS TIME.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.000
WERE YOU ON DRUGS
LAST NIGHT?

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
YES, I WAS HIGH,
OKAY, BUT I WASN'T HOME.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.700
WHERE WERE YOU, THEN?

23:24.700 --> 23:25.800
I SNUCK OUT.

23:25.900 --> 23:26.900
THERE'S A LADDER
IN THE ATTIC

23:27.200 --> 23:30.200
THAT I USE TO GET DOWNSTAIRS
WITHOUT MY PARENTS KNOWING.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.900
WAIT A MINUTE --
ARE YOU TELLING ME

23:32.000 --> 23:35.700
YOU LEFT A WINDOW
TO YOUR BEDROOM UNLOCKED

23:35.700 --> 23:37.100
AND A LADDER
LEANING AGAINST THE HOUSE?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.000
NO.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.900
NO, OKAY?

23:40.900 --> 23:42.700
I LAY THE LADDER DOWN
WHERE IT CAN'T BE SEEN,

23:42.700 --> 23:44.800
AND I PULL IT BACK UP
IN THE ATTIC WHEN I GET HOME.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.900
IT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.600
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SNEAKING OUT?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.200
JUST THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.200
AND WHO ARE YOU SNEAKING OUT
TO SEE, HIGH ON ECSTASY?

23:59.600 --> 24:03.600
I NEED A NAME NOW.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.400
ERIC DEAN WALLACE,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST --

24:07.400 --> 24:09.000
NO, JUST WAIT! JUST WAIT!

24:09.100 --> 24:10.400
WHO PICKS YOU UP?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.400
OKAY. JUSTIN DARCY.
JUSTIN PICKS ME UP.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.400
WHO IS JUSTIN DARCY?

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
HE'S MY MATH TUTOR.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.300
WHY DOES JUSTIN
PICK YOU UP?

24:20.300 --> 24:24.300
'CAUSE WE WENT
TO A CLUB...DANCING,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.600
AND THEN WE WENT BACK
TO HIS APARTMENT.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.600
TO STUDY MATH ON "X"?

24:37.500 --> 24:39.300
DID YOUR FATHER FIND OUT

24:39.500 --> 24:41.000
YOU WERE SNEAKING OUT
AND WHO YOU WERE WITH?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.600
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED,
ERIC?

24:42.600 --> 24:45.400
WAS YOUR DAD WAITING UP FOR YOU?
DID YOU TWO FIGHT?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.700
NO. OKAY? NO, THEY NEVER KNEW.
JUST PLEASE --

24:48.700 --> 24:50.300
DID JUSTIN KNOW
THAT THE WINDOW

24:50.300 --> 24:51.800
TO YOUR BEDROOM
WAS UNLOCKED?

24:51.800 --> 24:52.600
DID HE GO BACK?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.500
NO, I WAS WITH HIM
THE WHOLE TIME.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.900
WHERE DID
YOUR FATHER WORK?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.300
I TOLD YOU.
HE WORKS FOR THE PRISON.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.000
WE HAVE CONTACTED
BOTH THOSE PRISONS,

25:02.100 --> 25:05.400
AND NEITHER OF THEM HAVE
EVER HEARD OF YOUR FATHER.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.400
NO.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.400
NO, NO, BUT HE WORKS THERE.
ASK DR. REICHTER.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.300
WHO'S DR. REICHTER?

25:13.300 --> 25:15.700
HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST.
HE WORKS WITH PRISONERS, OKAY?

25:15.700 --> 25:17.700
HIM AND MY DAD,
THEY WRITE ARTICLES TOGETHER.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.500
ASK DR. REICHTER.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.900
OKAY, LET'S CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.
WHAT'S HIS NUMBER?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE IT.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.300
I JUST HEARD HIS NAME
SAID A LOT.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.600
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH, OKAY?
I SWEAR IT.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.000
YOU SWEAR IT?!

25:30.000 --> 25:31.300
WELL, YOU'RE SUCH
AN HONEST YOUNG MAN.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.100
WHY WOULD ANYONE
DOUBT YOU?

25:33.100 --> 25:35.000
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I'M SORRY.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
YOU'RE SORRY?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.300
YOU'VE ALREADY ADMITTED
TO LEAVING YOUR HOUSE UNSECURED.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.500
THAT MAKES YOU
PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

25:39.500 --> 25:40.800
FOR THE MURDER
OF YOUR FAMILY,

25:40.800 --> 25:42.900
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T
KILL THEM YOURSELF.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.600
YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE

25:44.700 --> 25:45.700
DURING THE TIME
OF THE MURDER,

25:45.700 --> 25:47.500
AND THE BEST YOU CAN
MANAGE IS, "I'M SORRY"?

25:47.500 --> 25:48.800
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?!

25:48.800 --> 25:52.600
DO YOU THINK "I'M SORRY"
WILL BRING YOUR MOTHER BACK?

25:52.600 --> 25:55.000
WHAT CAN
I SAY TO CHANGE --

25:55.000 --> 25:56.400
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THINGS NOW!

25:56.500 --> 25:59.200
NO! I WISH I WAS DEAD!

25:59.200 --> 26:01.400
OKAY?! DOES THAT HELP?!
I WISH I WAS DEAD.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.600
I WISH WHOEVER
KILLED MY FAMILY KILLED ME!

26:04.700 --> 26:08.500
OKAY, I WISH I WAS DEAD!

26:08.500 --> 26:10.100
UHHH!

26:17.500 --> 26:19.100
THOSE ARE THE MAGIC WORDS.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.500
SUICIDE WATCH.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.700
72 HOURS SURVEILLANCE.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.100
FIRST THING TOMORROW, I WANT TO
INTERVIEW THIS JUSTIN DARCY.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.300
I WANT THAT LADDER
CHECKED FOR PRINTS.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.500
AND I WANT TO TALK
TO DR. REICHTER.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.900
YEAH, WELL,
TOMORROW IS SUNDAY.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.700
THERE'S NO OVERTIME.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.200
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.300
I'LL LEAD THE DOCTOR IN
TO SEE HIM.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.200
I'M SORRY, MOM.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.300
I'M SORRY, MOM.
I'M SORRY, JENNY.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.000
SO IN SEVERAL OF HIS ARTICLES
ABOUT PRISON LIFE,

26:57.100 --> 26:59.700
MR. WALLACE
QUOTES A DR. ROBERT REICHTER.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.000
AND SO I CALLED THE PRISONS
AT TERMINAL ISLAND AND LOMPOC,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.800
AND REICHTER'S A PSYCHOLOGIST
AT BOTH FACILITIES.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.800
LIVES IN LOMPOC,
BUT HE'S OFF THIS WEEKEND.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.300
WELL,
CAN'T WE CALL HIM?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.600
WOULDN'T THEY GIVE YOU
HIS HOME NUMBER?

27:11.700 --> 27:14.300
NOT OVER THE PHONE.
HE'S A FEDERAL PRISON EMPLOYEE.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.100
I COULDN'T EVEN GET HIS DRIVER'S
LICENSE ON A SEARCH.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.800
UM, WHAT ABOUT THE LETTER
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE?

27:20.800 --> 27:24.000
OH, I GOT THREE SETS
OF PRINTS.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.800
ONE'S ERIC'S.
ONE'S HIS FATHER'S.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.500
ONE WE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.
RAN IT THROUGH AFIS -- NO HIT.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.800
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GARDENER
OR SOMETHING.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.800
OR IT COULD BE OUR FRIEND
JUSTIN DARCY.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.600
HE'S IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM RIGHT
NOW WITH FLYNN AND SANCHEZ.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.100
SO WALLACE DIDN'T
WORK AT THE PRISONS THEMSELVES,

27:42.100 --> 27:43.800
BUT MAYBE HE DID WORK
WITH THE PRISON EMPLOYEES?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.300
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.500
OKAY, SO, THE SUICIDE WATCH
FROM LAST NIGHT IS OFFICIAL,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.300
AND THE DOCTOR SAYS
HE CAN KEEP ERIC SEDATED

27:50.300 --> 27:52.800
UNLESS YOU
WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.200
SUICIDE WATCH?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.600
HI, EVERYBODY.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.300
ERIC WALLACE
SAID HE WISHED HE WAS DEAD.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.100
DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD
A SUICIDAL TEENAGER HERE, WILL?

28:11.200 --> 28:12.400
I WANT YOU TO ARREST THE KID,

28:12.400 --> 28:14.200
PUT HIM IN THE CUSTODY
OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

28:14.200 --> 28:15.800
AND LET THEM PAY
FOR THE SUICIDE WATCH.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.900
IF I ARREST HIM,
WILL, HE'LL GET AN ATTORNEY.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.600
OR DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO GET A CONFESSION?

28:20.600 --> 28:22.100
YOU HAVE A STRONG
CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.400
BUT I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

28:23.400 --> 28:26.100
LIKE WHY DOES ERIC INSIST THAT
HIS FATHER WORKS AT PRISONS?

28:26.100 --> 28:28.000
WHY WERE THE ROOMS
IN THE HOUSE TOSSED,

28:28.100 --> 28:29.500
BUT NOTHING
SEEMS TO BE STOLEN?

28:30.100 --> 28:34.100
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CLOTHES
IN THE WASHER?

28:35.900 --> 28:37.400
AND THERE'S
A PRISON PSYCHOLOGIST,

28:37.500 --> 28:38.300
??????

28:38.400 --> 28:39.500
AND THE FEDS
WON'T GIVE ME HIS NUMBER,

28:39.500 --> 28:42.300
AND I NEED TO TALK
TO HIM IN THE WORST WAY.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.300
DO YOU HAVE A MOTIVE?

28:43.300 --> 28:44.500
MR. WALLACE
MAY HAVE DISCOVERED

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
HIS SON WAS SLIPPING OUT
TO MEET A BOYFRIEND.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.800
ARGUMENTS ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT
HAVE A WAY OF ESCALATING.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.900
AND ERIC WAS TO INHERIT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.300
SO, MOTIVE, MEANS,
OPPORTUNITY, SUSPECT.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.800
IS IT REALLY NECESSARY
TO CALL IN EVERYONE ON EARTH

28:56.800 --> 28:59.100
ON SUNDAY
TO TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS?

28:59.100 --> 29:01.500
I DON'T HAVE
EVERYONE ON EARTH HERE.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.700
I HAVE NO CIVILIAN ASSISTANTS
AT ALL.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.800
HEY, CHIEF -- SORRY.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.500
UM, LIEUTENANT FLYNN
WANTED ME TO TELL YOU

29:09.500 --> 29:12.100
THAT HE JUST MIRANDIZED
THE JUSTIN DARCY GUY ON TAPE.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.000
OKAY. THANK YOU, BUZZ.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.400
REALLY?
NO CIVILIANS AT ALL? HMM.

29:20.900 --> 29:24.000
YOU KNOW, LOOK, IF YOU ARE
THIS WORRIED ABOUT MONEY,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.300
YOU KNOW
WHAT IS REALLY CHEAP?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.500
NOT SOLVING THE CRIME.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.800
DON'T YOU SPEND SUNDAY
WITH YOUR KIDS?

29:34.900 --> 29:35.700
THEY'RE WITH THEIR MOTHER.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.700
ESTELLE TAKES THEM
TO THEME PARKS.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.400
I GET TO TURN OFF
THE TELEVISION,

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
MAKE THEM EAT THEIR VEGETABLES,
AND PUT THEM TO BED.

29:45.200 --> 29:49.000
GUESS WHO THEY PREFER
SPENDING TIME WITH.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.900
WHAT ALL THAT MEANS
IS THAT I ALREADY UNDERSTAND

29:51.900 --> 29:55.500
HOW HARD IT IS
TO SPLIT UP A FAMILY.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.100
AND SINCE YOU DON'T
SEEM TO BE TAKING ME SERIOUSLY,

29:57.100 --> 29:59.500
LET ME REMIND YOU
THAT TOMORROW I NEED THE NAME

29:59.500 --> 30:03.500
OF THE DETECTIVE YOU'RE
RELEASING FROM THIS SQUAD.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.300
NO. NO, NO.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.700
I'M ACTIVELY LOOKING
FOR THE MONEY WE NEED TO SAVE.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.700
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ACTIVELY
SEARCHING FOR IT

30:09.700 --> 30:10.900
AT TIME AND A HALF.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.300
LOOK, HERE'S THE SOLUTION.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.600
PROVENZA RETIRES,

30:14.600 --> 30:18.600
OR YOU SEND SOMEONE
TO COUNTERTERRORISM TOMORROW.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.500
GOOD MORNING, MR. DARCY.

30:27.500 --> 30:30.500
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, LAPD,

30:30.500 --> 30:33.900
AND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU IN
THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT RAPE.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.900
I HAVEN'T RAPED
ANYONE EVER.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.500
Brenda:
 <i>I HAVE A STATEMENT</i>

30:39.600 --> 30:42.200
 <i>ALLEGING SEXUAL ASSAULT</i>
 <i>FROM YOUR VICTIM.</i>

30:42.300 --> 30:44.300
DO YOU KNOW
HOW STUPID THAT IS?

30:44.300 --> 30:47.100
I THINK I SHOULD GET MY ONE
PHONE CALL AND TALK TO MY DAD.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.400
HE'S A CRIMINAL ATTORNEY,
OKAY?

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
SO I THINK I KNOW A BIT MORE
ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

30:51.500 --> 30:55.100
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
YOU DRAG IN HERE.

30:55.100 --> 30:55.700
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

30:55.700 --> 30:59.200
WOULD YOU PLEASE
HAND MR. DARCY YOUR PHONE?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.000
AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,
MR. DARCY,

31:01.100 --> 31:03.400
GIVEN YOUR VAST KNOWLEDGE
OF THE LAW,

31:03.500 --> 31:05.600
THAT THE AGE OF CONSENT
FOR MALE-MALE SEX

31:05.700 --> 31:08.400
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
IS 18.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.500
I'M 19 IN 2 MONTHS.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.900
MANY HAPPY RETURNS.

31:13.900 --> 31:14.700
ERIC WALLACE,

31:14.700 --> 31:18.700
THE BOY WHOM YOU ARE
CURRENTLY TUTORING, IS 17.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.000
MAKE SURE
TO TELL YOUR FATHER

31:21.000 --> 31:23.400
THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU
WILL INCLUDE

31:23.400 --> 31:25.200
BUT WILL NOT
NECESSARILY BE LIMITED TO

31:25.300 --> 31:28.300
STATUTORY RAPE
AND SEX WITH A MINOR.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.100
I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING YOUR FAMILY.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.100
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW PROUD THEY'LL BE.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.600
HEY, I'LL DIAL YOUR DAD.
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

31:35.600 --> 31:37.000
WAIT. OKAY.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.800
WAIT. NO,
I NEVER HAD SEX WITH ERIC.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.500
IF THAT'S TRUE,
WE'LL BE ARRESTING

31:41.500 --> 31:44.700
YOUR UNDERAGE BOYFRIEND
FOR THE MURDER OF HIS FAMILY.

31:44.700 --> 31:45.400
WHAT?

31:45.400 --> 31:46.400
Flynn:
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST,

31:46.400 --> 31:47.700
ERIC'S PARENTS
AND HIS SISTER

31:47.700 --> 31:50.100
WERE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH
IN THEIR HOME.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.500
Oh,my God!

31:52.500 --> 31:54.800
ERIC GAVE A STATEMENT
SAYING THAT HE WAS WITH YOU

31:54.800 --> 31:56.300
DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDER,
DANCING AND CARRYING ON,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
??????,AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ALL.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.300
SO WHO'S THE LIAR --
YOU OR ERIC?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.900
 <i>SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING</i>
 <i>IS EITHER I'M A SEX OFFENDER...</i>

32:07.900 --> 32:10.600
I THINK I FOUND WHAT
THE MURDERER WAS LOOKING FOR.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.300
 <i>...OR ERIC'S A KILLER?</i>

32:12.400 --> 32:14.600
MAYBE YOU PICKED ERIC UP,
DROPPED HIM OFF AT YOUR PLACE,

32:14.700 --> 32:17.400
WENT BACK, AND MURDERED
HIS PARENTS YOURSELF.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
YOU KNEW
THERE WAS A WINDOW OPEN.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.700
NO. WAIT. WAIT.
NO. OKAY.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.300
YES, I PICKED HIM UP
FRIDAY NIGHT.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.400
YES, OKAY?

32:27.500 --> 32:31.500
BUT -- BUT IF HIS PARENTS DIED
BEFORE 3:00 IN THE MORNING,

32:32.100 --> 32:34.800
HE DIDN'T DO IT,
AND NEITHER DID I.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.600
DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE
THAT CAN BACK UP THAT STORY?

32:37.600 --> 32:41.600
YEAH. YEAH, WE MET UP
WITH SOME FRIENDS

32:41.700 --> 32:44.600
WHEN WE WENT OUT DANCING.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.500
WRITE IT ALL DOWN --

32:45.600 --> 32:47.200
EVERYWHERE YOU WENT,
EVERYONE YOU SAW --

32:47.300 --> 32:49.200
NAME, NUMBERS, TIMES.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.100
EXCUSE ME.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.800
EXPLAIN, PLEASE.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.200
THE WALLACES' CARRIER
SAID THEY HAD FOUR CELLPHONES.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.600
DANIELS
FOUND THIS ONE CHARGING

33:02.600 --> 33:04.600
BEHIND THE WET BAR
IN THE DEN OF THEIR HOUSE.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.400
WE THOUGHT IT WAS
ONE OF THE FOUR IN THE PLAN.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.300
IT TURNS OUT IT ISN'T.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.600
WHOSE IS IT, THEN?

33:09.600 --> 33:13.600
WELL, IT BELONGS TO, UH,
DR. ROBERT REICHTER.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT THE WALLACES

33:19.000 --> 33:20.500
HAD REICHTER'S PHONE
IN THEIR DEN

33:20.500 --> 33:22.200
AND WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT
ABOUT THIS NOW?

33:25.100 --> 33:27.000
I ORDERED
THE PHONE DUMPS LAST NIGHT.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.600
THEY COULDN'T
GET IT BACK TO US TILL TODAY,

33:28.600 --> 33:30.700
SO I SIGNED OUT,
LID YOU ASKED,

33:30.700 --> 33:34.700
AND I JUST STARTED
DOWNLOADING CELLS A MINUTE AGO.

33:34.700 --> 33:38.700
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS
LITTLE PRICK'S STORY, DO YOU?

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
PLEASE SIT WITH MR. DARCY

33:38.500 --> 33:40.200
UNTIL I'M READY
TO SPEAK WITH HIM AGAIN.

33:43.300 --> 33:44.600
[ DOOR CLOSES ]
IMPOSSIBLE!

33:47.400 --> 33:48.800
SO, WERE THERE ANY CALLS

33:48.800 --> 33:50.900
FROM DR. REICHTER'S CELL
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

33:50.900 --> 33:52.600
Gabriel: YES, MA'AM,
DR. REICHTER

33:52.600 --> 33:55.900
WAS CALLING ERIC WALLACE
ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.400
NOT THE FATHER?

33:58.400 --> 34:00.500
NO, MA'AM,
HE WAS CALLING THE SON.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.800
ERIC WALLACE TOLD ME HE'D
NEVER SPOKEN TO DR. REICHTER,

34:03.800 --> 34:06.700
THAT...
HE HAD ONLY HEARD THE NAME.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.100
OKAY, JUST...

34:10.100 --> 34:11.699
JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND HERE.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.000
THESE BAD LIES
ARE CONFUSING ME.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.800
WE FOUND FOUR CELLPHONES
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.699
DR. REICHTER'S WAS
ONE OF THE FOUR PHONES WE FOUND.

34:21.699 --> 34:23.000
SO WHOSE PHONE'S MISSING?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.500
MR. WALLACE'S, BUT WE HAVE
THE DUMP OFF OF HIS NUMBER.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.699
WERE THERE ANY CALLS MADE

34:27.699 --> 34:29.900
ON DR. WALLACE'S PHONE
SINCE HIS DEATH?

34:30.199 --> 34:32.600
AT AROUND 1:00 A.M.
SATURDAY MORNING,

34:32.600 --> 34:36.199
SOMEONE MADE 15 CALLS IN A ROW
FROM MR. WALLACE'S CELLPHONE

34:36.199 --> 34:37.800
TO THE PHONE
YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND.

34:37.800 --> 34:44.600
OKAY, SO THE KILLER
GRABBED MR. WALLACE'S CELLPHONE

34:44.600 --> 34:46.000
AND STARTED
WALKING AROUND WITH IT,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.500
AND CALLING
DR. REICHTER'S CELL.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.600
Daniels: HOPING REICHTER'S
CELL WOULD RING,

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
BUT REICHTER'S PHONE
WAS OFF.

34:52.900 --> 34:55.400
CHARGING BEHIND THE WET BAR
IN THE DEN,

34:55.500 --> 34:56.900
MAYBE LIKE IT WAS HIDDEN.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.600
SO THE PHONE
I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND --

34:59.600 --> 35:01.100
DR. REICHTER'S PHONE --

35:01.100 --> 35:03.200
THIS IS WHAT THE KILLER
WAS LOOKING FOR.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.400
OKAY.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.100
THERE ARE --
THERE ARE NO PICTURES IN HERE,

35:09.100 --> 35:14.000
ONLY...SIX...
PROGRAMMED NUMBERS.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.600
NOW, WHY WOULD
THIS PHONE BE WORTH HIDING,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.900
AND WHY
WAS DR. REICHTER'S PHONE

35:20.900 --> 35:23.000
AT THE WALLACES' HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.300
THAT'S THE REALLY
IMPORTANT QUESTION,

35:25.300 --> 35:27.100
AND WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
TO ASK IT YESTERDAY

35:27.100 --> 35:29.800
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ALL
THIS MALARKEY ABOUT BUDGET CUTS.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.600
NOW I REALLY NEED
TO SEE THOSE VISITORS LISTS

35:33.600 --> 35:35.500
FROM TERMINAL ISLAND
AND LOMPOC.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.500
CHIEF, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT GONNA WANT TO HEAR THIS,

35:38.500 --> 35:40.900
BUT THE GUY WHO COULD
HELP CUT THROUGH SOME OF
THIS RED TAPE --

35:40.900 --> 35:44.800
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I JUST -- I KNOW.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.900
Taylor: LET'S LOOK
FOR THIS GUY WALLACE

35:48.400 --> 35:51.200
THROUGH ABOUT, UH,
SIX MONTHS BACK.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.400
OH. OH,
YOU'RE DR. REICHTER'S PARENTS.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.900
BOTH PRISONS
WOULD BE GREAT.

35:56.900 --> 35:59.000
GOODNESS, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I COULD HAVE MIXED THAT UP.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.800
THANK YOU.
I OWE YOU A DINNER.
UNLESS HE'S VISITING YOU.

36:02.300 --> 36:07.000
OH. OH, HE'S IN L.A.
FOR THE WEEK. RIGHT.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.800
OKAY. WELL,
I-I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.400
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.100
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU. BYE.

36:14.100 --> 36:17.400
OKAY, SO THAT'S
DR. REICHTER'S WIFE, SISTER,

36:17.400 --> 36:19.800
SON, AND PARENTS
ALL TELLING ME THAT HE'S IN L.A.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.700
AT THE SAME QUALITY INN
BY THE HARBOR.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.300
THE BLACK-AND-WHITES
I SENT THERE SAY

36:23.300 --> 36:26.300
REICHTER NEVER CHECKED OUT,
AT LEAST NOT UNDER HIS OWN NAME.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.800
DANIELS DRAGGED
HIS CREDIT CARDS,

36:27.800 --> 36:29.400
AND DR. REICHTER
STOPPED USING THEM.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.900
OH. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.000
IT'S OKAY.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.900
WELL, IF THERE'S ANYONE
WHO KNOWS

36:36.900 --> 36:38.000
HOW TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY

36:38.000 --> 36:39.600
SO AS NOT TO GET CAUGHT
BY THE POLICE,

36:39.600 --> 36:41.300
IT WOULD
BE A PRISON SHRINK.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.100
THE FIRST THING
THEY HEAR FROM CONVICTS
AFTER "I'M INNOCENT"

36:44.100 --> 36:45.800
IS HOW EVERYONE GOT CAUGHT.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.000
REICHTER'S PROBABLY BEEN TOLD
HOW TO STAY OFF THE GRID,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.600
HOW TO ESTABLISH AN ALIAS,

36:51.600 --> 36:53.800
HOW TO GET OVERSEAS
WITH LOTS OF CASH.

36:54.900 --> 36:58.700
HAVE YOU DECIDED HOW
YOU'RE RECONFIGURING YOUR SQUAD?

36:58.700 --> 37:02.900
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE
AN IDEA THAT MIGHT BE OF HELP.

37:02.900 --> 37:03.700
Man:
Hello, Mr. Taylor?

37:03.700 --> 37:05.100
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.600
WALLACE NEVER
VISITED EITHER FACILITY?

37:11.500 --> 37:13.600
WELL, UH...
THANKS FOR LOOKING.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.700
BACK AT YOU.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.900
SO ERIC JUST FABRICATED
HIS FATHER'S WORK LIFE?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.200
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME GABRIEL?

37:32.300 --> 37:32.900
EXCUSE ME?

37:32.900 --> 37:35.400
AND I'LL HANDLE
ALL FURTHER TRANSFERS

37:35.400 --> 37:38.000
AND RETIREMENTS THAT WE NEED
TO MAKE OUR BUDGET WORK

37:38.000 --> 37:39.900
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS
THAT REPORT TO ME.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.600
I'LL EVEN SHARE GABRIEL
WITH YOU

37:42.100 --> 37:44.000
ON THE BIG CASES
WHEN YOU NEED HIM.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.500
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING
THAT GABRIEL

37:47.500 --> 37:49.200
SPEND PART OF HIS TIME
WITH YOU AND...

37:50.700 --> 37:51.900
PART OF HIS TIME
WITH ME?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.400
IT'S IN THE KID'S
BEST INTEREST, CHIEF.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.700
YOU ALREADY
HAVE THREE LIEUTENANTS.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.600
WHAT CHANCE
DOES GABRIEL HAVE

37:58.600 --> 38:00.500
FOR A PROMOTION
WORKING FOR YOU?

38:03.400 --> 38:05.400
I'LL, UH --
I'LL DISCUSS IT WITH HIM

38:05.400 --> 38:06.700
ON MY WAY UP TO LOMPOC.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.700
YOU'RE GOING TO
LOMPOC NOW?

38:08.700 --> 38:10.300
I AM, AND, UH...

38:11.600 --> 38:14.100
I APPRECIATE
THE SUGGESTION, COMMANDER.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.000
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.500
HAPPY TO HELP, CHIEF.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.800
NO, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.800
OKAY, LOMPOC POLICE
FOUND A FRIENDLY JUDGE,

38:29.800 --> 38:31.900
AND YOUR WARRANT
WILL BE READY WHEN WE ARRIVE.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.200
OKAY, THANK YOU.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.200
UH...SO, SERGEANT,
THERE'S THIS OTHER THING.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.100
UM...

38:41.600 --> 38:44.400
COMMANDER TAYLOR SUGGESTED
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO

38:44.400 --> 38:45.900
GO BACK TO WORK FOR HIM.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.000
HE THINKS IT MIGHT IMPROVE
YOUR CHANCES OF PROMOTION.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.500
IN RETURN, HE WOULD ABSORB
ALL FUTURE BUDGET CUTS.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.700
AND I PROMISED
I'D MENTION IT TO YOU.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.800
IS...THAT...
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.900
YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK
AND WORK FOR TAYLOR?

39:01.900 --> 39:02.900
HARDLY.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.600
BUT, UM, IF YOU THINK

39:05.600 --> 39:08.200
IT'S IN YOUR OWN
LONG-TERM BEST INTEREST --

39:08.200 --> 39:09.000
WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

39:09.000 --> 39:11.600
THAT LAPD
IS GONNA BE MY WHOLE CAREER.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.900
IN FACT, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE ABOUT GOING INTO POLITICS.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.800
YOU'RE KIDDING.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.700
WELL, I HAVE
A LAW-ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND,

39:18.700 --> 39:20.600
A MASTER'S
IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.

39:20.600 --> 39:26.500
HEY, THIS, UH --
THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO LOMPOC.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.400
NO, WE'RE GOING TO
THE AIRPORT.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.600
WE'RE TAKING
THE LAPD PLANE?

39:30.700 --> 39:33.000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING MONEY.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.900
NO, SERGEANT, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE FINDING A MURDERER,

39:35.900 --> 39:38.300
AND WE ARE NOT DOING IT
IN THE CAR-POOL LANE.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.000
THANKS FOR THE ESCORT
FROM THE AIRPORT, CAPTAIN.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.200
OUR PLEASURE.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
WE TRAIN FOR THIS
KIND OF THING A LOT,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.800
BUT WE DON'T GET TO DO IT
AS MUCH AS YOU GUYS.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.300
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT.
EVERYONE HERE LOOKS VERY SHARP.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
THANKS, SON.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
WE'LL JUST FAX
THAT BILL DOWN TO...
CHIEF WILL POPE.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.700
I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBER
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.400
THINK DR. REICHTER'S HERE?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.400
NO, SERGEANT,
DR. REICHTER'S DEAD.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.300
YES -- OH, MY GOD.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.100
ARE YOU
MISS KATHY REICHTER?

40:11.100 --> 40:12.600
YES.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

40:12.600 --> 40:14.100
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ROBERT?

40:14.100 --> 40:15.900
WE'RE HERE
TO SERVE A SEARCH WARRANT.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.200
IF YOU COULD STEP ASIDE
AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
DOOR ON THE LEFT.
CLOSE RIGHT.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.700
MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:25.700 --> 40:26.800
TWO STEPS BACK.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.500
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON, LAPD.
AND YOU ARE?

40:30.500 --> 40:31.500
KIM REICHTER.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.100
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR FATHER IS?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.100
LOS ANGELES
UNTIL WEDNESDAY.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.500
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO HIM?

40:36.500 --> 40:38.800
FRIDAY NIGHT. MOM,
WHAT IS HE DOING OVER THERE?

40:38.800 --> 40:42.100
LEAVE THOSE PICTURES ALONE!
YOU CAN'T INVADE OUR PRIVACY!

40:42.100 --> 40:43.400
MOM...
BUT WHAT ARE THEY
LOOKING FOR?!

40:43.400 --> 40:45.500
MOM!
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW!
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

40:45.500 --> 40:46.300
ANSWER ME!

40:47.100 --> 40:48.300
ANSWER ME!
HEY!

40:49.900 --> 40:53.100
MRS. REICHTER,
MEET KEVIN ALAN WALLACE.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.600
Brenda: DID YOU KNOW
YOUR HUSBAND WAS A BIGAMIST?

41:03.600 --> 41:04.900
IT'S JUST...

41:06.500 --> 41:08.100
HARD TO TAKE IN
EVERYTHING.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.900
AND, UH...

41:12.000 --> 41:16.100
ALL OF THE OTHER FAMILY
WERE STABBED TO DEATH?

41:16.100 --> 41:17.600
EXCEPT THE SON, YES.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.700
DR. REICHTER
LEFT LOMPOC ON FRIDAY.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.800
WEREN'T YOU WORRIED
WHEN YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM?

41:26.500 --> 41:28.200
 <i>WE'RE USED TO</i>
 <i>ROBERT'S SCHEDULE.</i>

41:29.200 --> 41:31.700
 <i>HE USED TO COME</i>
 <i>TO TERMINAL ISLAND HERE IN L.A.</i>

41:31.700 --> 41:33.000
 <i>EVERY OTHER WEEK,</i>

41:33.000 --> 41:36.300
AND I'M ON NIGHTS
AT THE PRISON IN LOMPOC.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.200
DID YOU WORK ON FRIDAY?

41:39.900 --> 41:40.700
YES.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.000
UH, HALF OF OUR
LITTLE MEDICAL STAFF WAS THERE.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.800
WE HAD A LIFER
WHO HAS COLON CANCER.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.100
HE WAS VERY SICK.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.800
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MY ALIBI?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.700
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON --
KIM?

41:54.200 --> 41:55.400
WHERE WAS HE ON FRIDAY?

41:57.400 --> 41:58.800
WAIT. WAIT, PLEASE.

42:02.300 --> 42:06.700
I KNEW...ABOUT THE WALLACES
FROM THE BEGINNING.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.800
I ADMIT.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.400
I-IT SOUNDS COMPLICATED,
BUT...

42:14.600 --> 42:17.900
...I WAS THE ONE
THAT ROBERT LOVED, NOT HER.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.800
SHE WAS JUST A --
A CONVENIENCE.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.100
REALLY?

42:25.400 --> 42:27.100
WELL, IF SHE
WAS JUST A CONVENIENCE

42:27.100 --> 42:29.300
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT HER
FROM THE BEGINNING,

42:29.300 --> 42:31.100
I WONDER
WHY YOU'RE USING PRONOUNS

42:31.100 --> 42:34.500
INSTEAD OF HER REAL NAME,
UNLESS YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

42:51.800 --> 42:52.700
HELLO.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.900
HI, SO, I COME BACK TO SEE
HOW THINGS ARE GOING HERE

42:55.900 --> 42:58.600
AND I FIND THAT, FIRST, YOU'VE
HAD A BOY ON SUICIDE WATCH

42:58.600 --> 43:00.600
TRANSPORTED TO YOUR OFFICE
UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.000
THAT'S ANOTHER
BILLION DOLLARS.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.200
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,

43:03.200 --> 43:06.800
BUT I NEED ERIC WALLACE
TO IDENTIFY SOME THINGS FOR ME.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.700
THEN I HEAR YOU'VE
COMMANDEERED THE DEPARTMENT JET

43:09.700 --> 43:10.800
TO GO TO LOMPOC.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.800
BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD TO BRING
BACK PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT.

43:13.900 --> 43:14.900
FREIGHT?

43:14.900 --> 43:17.200
YES. CLOTHES,
FINANCIAL RECORDS, PICTURES.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.800
SO YOU FLEW ROUND-TRIP
TO LOMPOC FOR SCRAPBOOKS?

43:20.800 --> 43:23.900
HERE IS A PICTURE OF
MR. WALLACE, ONE OF OUR VICTIMS.

43:24.700 --> 43:25.700
OKAY. SO?

43:25.800 --> 43:28.500
AND HERE IS A PICTURE
OF DR. REICHTER,

43:29.200 --> 43:31.100
THE PRISON PSYCHOLOGIST
FROM LOMPOC.

43:31.600 --> 43:35.000
WOW. SO YOUR MURDER VICTIM
WAS A BIGAMIST?

43:35.000 --> 43:37.400
YES, AND NOW I NEED TO
SPEAK TO HIS WIFE AND SON.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.800
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

43:38.900 --> 43:41.000
HAVE YOU TALKED TO PROVENZA
ABOUT RETIREMENT YET?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.700
NO, SHE HASN'T.
SHOULD SHE?

43:43.800 --> 43:46.100
NO, LIEUTENANT, NO.

43:48.700 --> 43:50.900
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE ELECTRONICS ROOM?

44:03.000 --> 44:07.300
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT US?

44:07.600 --> 44:09.100
SERGEANT,
I'VE FIGURED OUT THE CRIME.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.200
I'M KIND OF
PUTTING EVERYTHING ELSE OFF.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.400
WAIT.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.900
IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO
LOSE LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,

44:16.900 --> 44:20.500
I THINK YOU SHOULD...
LET ME GO

44:20.500 --> 44:22.700
AND WORK THINGS OUT
WITH CHIEF POPE.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.200
DO YOU MEAN THAT,
SERGEANT?

44:31.400 --> 44:35.100
I'VE, UM --
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
AND, YES, MA'AM,
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM

44:38.600 --> 44:40.000
ABOUT IT
WHEN WE'RE THROUGH HERE.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.500
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
LET'S GO.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.900
BE SURE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.700
I AM.
THESE ARE MY CLOTHES.

45:03.100 --> 45:06.300
OKAY. THANKS.
I'M SORRY.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.500
I KNOW
IT WAS A LONG WAY TO COME

45:09.500 --> 45:10.800
TO HAVE YOUR RIGHTS
READ TO YOU

45:10.800 --> 45:12.500
AND TO LOOK
THROUGH YOUR OWN CLOSET,

45:12.900 --> 45:14.700
ESPECIALLY AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER,

45:14.700 --> 45:17.500
BUT THIS WAS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

45:17.500 --> 45:19.800
TO FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED YOUR FATHER.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.200
THANKS.

45:22.800 --> 45:23.700
WATCH IT.

45:27.900 --> 45:30.300
LOOK,
I DID NOT KILL MY FAMILY!

45:30.400 --> 45:33.000
OKAY, FINE.
THEN HELP ME FOR ONCE.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.500
WHY SHOULD I?
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME!

45:34.500 --> 45:36.700
AND WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?!

45:37.100 --> 45:38.000
WHO'S GONNA HELP ME?!

45:38.000 --> 45:42.200
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!
I HAVE NO ONE LEFT!

45:42.200 --> 45:44.600
BUT THAT'S
NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.400
NOW, I'VE GOT
TWO MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU,

45:46.400 --> 45:49.400
AND IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH,
THEN YOU AND I ARE DONE.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.200
FINE.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.700
OKAY, FIRST,
DID YOUR FATHER CALL YOU A LOT

45:55.700 --> 45:57.200
WHEN HE WAS UP AT LOMPOC?

45:57.800 --> 45:58.900
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.700
OKAY, AND DO YOU THINK
THAT ANY OF THE CLOTHES

46:02.700 --> 46:04.900
ON THIS RACK MIGHT BE YOURS?

46:07.300 --> 46:11.400
THESE ARE MY SHOES.
I CHANGED THE LACES IN THEM.

46:13.900 --> 46:14.900
THIS IS MY SHIRT.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.600
IT'S GOT A TAG FROM
OUR DRY CLEANERS ON THE COLLAR.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.700
THESE JEANS. YEAH.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.200
I PUT THIS HOLE IN THERE
MYSELF.

46:26.900 --> 46:28.000
THANK YOU, ERIC.

46:28.000 --> 46:28.800
YEAH.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.700
WOULD YOU GET MY BAG, PLEASE?
THANK YOU.

46:40.100 --> 46:43.600
AND NOW, UH,
DETECTIVE DANIELS HERE

46:43.600 --> 46:45.900
HAS SOME INFORMATION
WE'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.900
INFORMATION LIKE WHAT?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.500
INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.900
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

46:58.800 --> 47:00.900
THANK YOU.
DETECTIVE.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.000
AND THAT WILL BE ALL,
GENTLEMEN. THANKS.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.800
I DON'T WANT TO
BOTHER YOU AGAIN, KIM,

47:11.100 --> 47:13.200
BUT YOU IDENTIFIED
THESE CLOTHES

47:13.200 --> 47:15.500
THAT I BROUGHT IN EARLIER
AS YOURS --

47:15.600 --> 47:20.600
THIS SHIRT AND THESE PANTS
AND THESE SHOES.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.300
AND THEY'RE SO MUCH NICER THAN
YOUR OTHER CLOTHES,

47:23.300 --> 47:25.600
SO I CHECKED
WITH YOUR HALF BROTHER, ERIC,

47:25.700 --> 47:27.500
AND HE SAYS THEY'RE HIS.

47:27.500 --> 47:28.800
AND I KIND OF BELIEVE HIM.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.000
Brenda: <i>NOW, I DON'T KNOW</i>
 <i>IF YOU KNOW THIS, KIM,</i>

47:33.000 --> 47:36.900
<i>BUT I CAN ACTUALLY TELL</i>
 <i>FROM THESE CLOTHES</i>

47:36.900 --> 47:39.700
AND FROM THE WOUNDS
IN THE BODY

47:39.700 --> 47:43.300
THE ORDER IN WHICH
YOU MURDERED YOUR FATHER

47:43.600 --> 47:46.800
AND HIS WIFE
AND YOUR HALF SISTER, JENNY.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.900
BECAUSE THE WEAPON THAT
YOU USED -- THE LETTER OPENER --

47:50.900 --> 47:53.500
ACTUALLY DEGRADED
AS YOU WENT ALONG.

47:54.200 --> 47:58.000
SO, FIRST,
YOU ATTACKED YOUR FATHER.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.600
AND THEN HIS WIFE

48:01.600 --> 48:03.700
HEARD HIM SCREAMING
OR WAS THERE.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.200
YOU FOUGHT WITH HER.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.400
AND YOU STABBED HER
TO DEATH

48:08.700 --> 48:10.500
AND THEN WENT BACK
AND FINISHED WITH YOUR DAD.

48:10.500 --> 48:13.400
JENNY RAN DOWN
TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.500
YOU CHASED HER
BACK UPSTAIRS...

48:17.700 --> 48:19.600
STABBED HER TO DEATH,
TOO.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.800
THESE ARE YOUR CLOTHES,

48:23.600 --> 48:26.800
WHICH YOU PUT IN THE WASHER
WHILE YOU SHOWERED,

48:26.800 --> 48:30.000
BUT YOU LOOKED FOR
YOUR FATHER'S CELLPHONE FIRST.

48:30.300 --> 48:32.800
SO THE STAINS SET IN,

48:33.200 --> 48:36.100
AND IT'S NO GOOD DRIVING AROUND
IN BLOODY CLOTHES, IS IT?

48:36.100 --> 48:37.400
SOMEONE MIGHT NOTICE.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.700
SO YOU STOLE THESE CLOTHES
FROM ERIC'S CLOSET.

48:41.700 --> 48:43.600
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING
THAT THEY FIT.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.600
YOU ARE BROTHERS,
AFTER ALL.

48:49.300 --> 48:52.900
THESE ARE THE FINGERPRINTS
THAT WE FOUND

48:52.900 --> 48:55.900
ON THE LADDER THAT YOU USED
TO ENTER THE HOUSE.

48:55.900 --> 48:57.700
NOW, WE HAVEN'T
IDENTIFIED THEM YET, KIM,

48:57.700 --> 49:00.800
BUT WHEN WE DO,
I'LL BET THEY MATCH YOUR HAND.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.700
AND SOMEWHERE, YOU STOPPED
TO FILL UP YOUR CAR.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
AND I'M GONNA
CHECK THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

49:08.000 --> 49:10.400
OF EVERY GAS STATION
ALONG THE WAY,

49:10.400 --> 49:13.000
AND I'M GONNA FIND YOU,
KIM,

49:13.800 --> 49:16.500
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROAD
BETWEEN HERE AND LOMPOC.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.300
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

49:20.400 --> 49:23.700
NOW, ALL WE HAVE LEFT
TO DECIDE, REALLY --

49:23.700 --> 49:26.300
AND THIS IS ONLY
IF YOU <i>WANT</i> TO HELP ME --

49:27.300 --> 49:30.200
IS IF YOU PLANNED ON KILLING
YOUR FATHER AND HIS FAMILY,

49:30.200 --> 49:32.700
OR IF IT WAS MORE OF
A SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT TYPE THING,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.300
STABBING YOUR FATHER
AND HIS WIFE.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.700
LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.300
THAT OTHER WOMAN
WASN'T MY FATHER'S WIFE, OKAY?

49:42.100 --> 49:42.900
OKAY.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.700
MY MOTHER WAS HIS WIFE,
NOT HER.

49:46.100 --> 49:47.000
OKAY.

49:48.300 --> 49:50.100
AND I NEVER
MEANT TO KILL ANYONE.

49:51.000 --> 49:51.900
OKAY.

49:57.100 --> 49:58.700
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN,
THEN?

50:02.200 --> 50:04.700
MY FATHER LOANED ME HIS CAR
WHILE MINE WAS IN THE SHOP.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.800
AND I BOUGHT SOME POT,
OKAY?

50:10.600 --> 50:12.000
AND I WAS HIDING IT
TO TAKE HOME

50:12.000 --> 50:13.800
IN CASE I GOT STOPPED
BY THE POLICE.

50:15.100 --> 50:17.100
AND THERE'S A ZIPPER
IN THE UPHOLSTERY

50:17.100 --> 50:19.900
OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT
OF MY DAD'S CAR.

50:21.300 --> 50:23.200
AND I PULLED IT OPEN,
AND IT ALL JUST...

50:25.200 --> 50:26.600
FELL IN MY HANDS.

50:30.900 --> 50:32.900
HIS OTHER DRIVER'S LICENSE,
HIS OTHER CELLPHONE,

50:32.900 --> 50:34.600
HIS OTHER CREDIT CARDS,
HIS OTHER...

50:39.600 --> 50:40.700
...LIFE.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.100
AND I COULDN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

50:48.600 --> 50:49.600
I COULDN'T.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.100
SO YOU WENT
TO THE OTHER ADDRESS

51:02.100 --> 51:03.800
ON YOUR FATHER'S
FAKE LICENSE.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.200
AND THERE THEY ALL WERE...

51:08.000 --> 51:09.400
IN THEIR BIG HOUSE

51:09.400 --> 51:11.800
WITH THEIR SWIMMING POOL
AND THEIR FANCY CARS.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.700
AND I TRIED TO STOP GOING.

51:16.100 --> 51:17.200
BUT I COULDN'T.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.400
I JUST KEPT
GOING BACK THERE EVERY DAY,

51:23.400 --> 51:26.800
AND I WOULD JUST WATCH THEM
COME AND GO

51:26.800 --> 51:28.600
WITH ALL THEIR FRIENDS
AND STUFF.

51:28.900 --> 51:32.000
AND I SAW ERIC SNEAKING OUT
OF HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
MY FATHER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
IF I HAD DONE THAT.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.700
SO THAT NIGHT,
WHEN HE WENT OUT,

51:41.600 --> 51:43.300
YOU JUST
WANTED TO SEE HIS ROOM.

51:44.800 --> 51:45.800
IS THAT RIGHT?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

51:53.900 --> 51:55.500
I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.600
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT GOING
IN THERE WOULD MAKE ME SO --

52:02.600 --> 52:03.400
SO MAD.

52:03.400 --> 52:06.200
TWO LAPTOPS, CABLE IN HIS ROOM,
TiVo, VIDEO iPods --

52:06.200 --> 52:08.300
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OF THAT STUFF!

52:09.100 --> 52:10.000
AND I WAS STANDING THERE,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.400
AND I SAW THAT PICTURE
OF MY FATHER AND HIM,

52:12.400 --> 52:14.200
SOME PLACE --
I THINK HAWAII, MAYBE.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.100
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I WAS DOWNSTAIRS,

52:16.100 --> 52:18.000
AND I WAS YELLING
AT MY DAD.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.500
AND THAT WOMAN CAME IN,
AND I TOLD HER WHO I WAS,

52:22.500 --> 52:25.100
AND HE SAID,
"DON'T LISTEN TO THIS KID."

52:28.900 --> 52:32.000
"HE'S A CONVICT
I WORK WITH IN LOMPOC."

52:42.400 --> 52:45.200
"HE'S A CONVICT
I WORK WITH."

52:49.400 --> 52:51.200
THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER
CALLED ME.

52:54.300 --> 52:56.100
SO I PICKED UP
THAT LITTLE SWORD ON HIS DESK,

52:56.100 --> 52:58.600
THAT FANCY LETTER OPENER
OR WHATEVER IT WAS,

52:58.600 --> 53:00.300
AND I STABBED HIM
WITH IT.

53:04.100 --> 53:05.800
AND THE REST
HAPPENED LIKE YOU SAID.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.600
YOU BROKE
INTO YOUR FATHER'S CAR?

53:13.700 --> 53:14.500
YEAH.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.900
I COULDN'T FIND
WHERE HE KEPT THE KEYS TO IT.

53:22.100 --> 53:24.300
I GOT HIS REAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
OUT OF THE SEAT,

53:24.300 --> 53:25.900
HIS REAL CREDIT CARDS,
AND I THOUGHT...

53:29.900 --> 53:31.800
"WELL, I NEVER KNEW
HE WAS TWO PEOPLE.

53:33.300 --> 53:35.000
MAYBE NO ONE ELSE
WOULD FIND OUT."

53:36.700 --> 53:39.600
EXCEPT I COULDN'T
FIND HIS STUPID CELLPHONE.

53:43.700 --> 53:44.800
SO I LEFT
WITH THE ONE I HAD,

53:44.800 --> 53:47.000
AND I THREW IT IN THE OCEAN
ON MY WAY HOME.

53:48.700 --> 53:50.300
WHY DID YOU
KEEP ERIC'S CLOTHES?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
THEY'RE NICE.

54:02.300 --> 54:03.600
HIS STUFF IS NICE.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.800
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE GIRL.

54:15.100 --> 54:17.100
SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
AND SAW ME.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.600
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT HER.

54:49.300 --> 54:51.100
Gabriel: SO, ON PAPER,
YOU TRANSFER EVERYONE

54:51.100 --> 54:53.700
FROM PRIORITY HOMICIDE
TO THE COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU.

54:53.700 --> 54:56.400
WHOA, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
THE MANDATED TRAINING FOR THAT.

54:57.300 --> 54:58.900
WELL, SEE, SIR,
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

54:59.300 --> 55:01.200
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL
ACTUALLY PAY YOU

55:01.200 --> 55:04.100
TO BRING US UP TO CODE,
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER PERSON

55:04.100 --> 55:06.500
WHICH YOU COULD ADD
TO YOUR BUDGET SHORTFALLS.

55:14.300 --> 55:17.500
WELL...THAT'S...

55:18.500 --> 55:19.700
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.800
SO, OFFICIALLY,
YOU WOULD ALL BE TRANSFERRED

55:22.800 --> 55:24.500
TO THE
COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU,

55:24.500 --> 55:27.300
WHICH WOULD SATISFY THE STATE,
BUT IN ACTUALITY,

55:27.300 --> 55:30.400
I COULD JUST LOAN YOU
RIGHT BACK TO PRIORITY HOMICIDE.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.000
EXACTLY, 'CAUSE YOU ONLY
NEED MORE PEOPLE

55:32.000 --> 55:33.900
IN COUNTERTERRORISM
WHEN THE THREAT LEVEL GOES UP.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.400
IF YOU WERE TO TRANSFER
THEM THERE PERMANENTLY --

55:36.400 --> 55:38.800
I'M PAYING PEOPLE TO STAND AROUND MOST OF THE TIME.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.400
YEAH, I HATE THAT.

55:40.500 --> 55:41.100
YEAH.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.200
YOU KNOW, SERGEANT,
FOR BUREAUCRATS,

55:45.200 --> 55:48.500
THIS PLAN OF YOURS
IS THE EQUIVALENT

55:48.500 --> 55:51.000
OF TURNING WATER
INTO WINE.

55:52.500 --> 55:55.000
MY ONLY QUESTION IS,
WHY ARE YOU HERE SUGGESTING IT,

55:55.000 --> 55:56.500
INSTEAD OF CHIEF JOHNSON?

55:57.700 --> 56:00.200
UH, WELL, SIR,
I THOUGHT

56:00.500 --> 56:04.500
SHE MIGHT LIKE THIS IDEA BETTER
IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS --

56:04.500 --> 56:05.500
MY IDEA.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.100
UH-HUH, WELL, I SEE
YOU'VE WORKED OUT EVERY DETAIL,

56:09.100 --> 56:11.100
INCLUDING
WHO SHE'S GOING TO BLAME.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.100
THAT'S REAL GENIUS.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.400
ALL RIGHT, SAY I DO THIS.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.300
YOUR CHIEF IS STILL SPENDING
LIKE A MADWOMAN.

56:18.300 --> 56:20.100
NOW, IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR ONE DIVISION

56:20.100 --> 56:22.400
TO HAVE EVERYTHING WHILE
EVERYONE ELSE IS CUTTING BACK.

56:22.400 --> 56:25.000
I COMPLETELY AGREE, SIR,
AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN

56:25.000 --> 56:26.900
TO REMIND HER OF THAT
ALONG THE WAY.

56:28.300 --> 56:29.200
HMM.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.600
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE,
SERGEANT.

56:34.200 --> 56:37.800
IT'S, UH...
REALLY, IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.300
THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

56:39.300 --> 56:40.500
THANK YOU.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.300
I'LL JUST --

56:41.300 --> 56:42.400
YEAH,
I'LL HANG ON TO THIS.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.500
OKAY.
THANK YOU, SIR.

56:54.700 --> 56:55.300
HEY.

56:56.000 --> 56:56.800
WHAT?

57:04.500 --> 57:05.300
OH.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.400
HEY.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.500
Brenda: HEY.

57:15.900 --> 57:17.900
YOU BROUGHT IN ALL YOUR STUFF
FROM THE GARAGE.

57:17.900 --> 57:19.000
I DID.

57:19.900 --> 57:21.100
COME SEE.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.000
COME SEE.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.800
THERE'S A BARBECUE
IN THE BATHROOM.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.300
UH, HONEY,
DO YOU THINK THAT MY BOOKS

57:38.600 --> 57:41.500
WILL LOOK BETTER
IF I PUT THE SHELVING UP

57:41.500 --> 57:45.300
AROUND THE CEILING IN HERE,
OR SHOULD I TRY THE KITCHEN?

57:48.600 --> 57:50.300
ACTUALLY,
DON'T GO IN THERE YET.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.100
THAT ROOM'S
STILL A LITTLE CROWDED.

57:53.300 --> 57:54.100
OKAY.

57:54.100 --> 57:56.200
OKAY. OKAY.

57:56.500 --> 57:57.800
OKAY, YOU WIN.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.400
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT
THIS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE MARKET

58:00.400 --> 58:02.200
AND FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE
TO LIVE.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.100
YOU SURE?

58:03.600 --> 58:06.700
I ONLY WANT TO DO THIS
IF YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON.

58:06.800 --> 58:11.300
WELL, I -- HONESTLY,
I DO HATE CHANGE A LOT.

58:11.300 --> 58:13.800
CHANGE IS --
IT'S JUST -- IT'S BAD.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.600
BUT?

58:15.600 --> 58:16.700
BUT, UM...

58:19.200 --> 58:24.700
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT,
IN A RELATIONSHIP LIKE OURS,

58:24.700 --> 58:28.600
TO KEEP ALL OF OUR STUFF
IN ONE PLACE.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.900
THANK YOU.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
DO I HAVE TO HELP YOU
PUT ALL THIS STUFF BACK?

58:48.700 --> 58:51.000
OH, YEAH.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.500
AH, MAYBE NOT TONIGHT.
