And You Betrayed Me. You're Fired.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.240

Take Care Of Daniel.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.120
Mr. Meade? (Monitor Emitting Continuous Tone)

00:23.280 --> 00:24.760

00:49.290 --> 00:50.690
Mr. Meade,

00:50.840 --> 00:52.500
Y-You're Dead...

00:52.650 --> 00:54.490
And In My Refrigerator.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.260
<I>A Box Of Baking Soda</I>  <I>Wouldn't Hurt In Here.</I>

00:59.820 --> 01:00.890
Okay.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.800
Okay. You Deserve This.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.349
You Eat Empanadas At 2:00 A.M.,

01:05.500 --> 01:06.890
You See A Ghost.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.840
Counting One,

01:09.340 --> 01:10.790
Two...

01:12.250 --> 01:13.670
Three.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.910
Ghost Gone.

01:16.060 --> 01:18.080
This Calls For Another Empanada.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.040
<I>I'm Not A Ghost,</I>  <I>Betty.</I>

01:22.190 --> 01:25.110
<I>I'm A Subconscious</I>  <I>Manifestation Of Your Guilt.</I>

01:25.280 --> 01:26.960
My Guilt Wears Island Casual?

01:27.130 --> 01:30.490
<I>I Didn't Pick It.</I>  <I>You Did.</I> I Guess You Were Always A Little Too Formal.

01:30.630 --> 01:33.580
Anyway,Why Are You Here? I'm Not Guilty Of Anything.

01:33.740 --> 01:36.350
<I>Really? You Promised Me</I>  <I>On My Deathbed</I>

01:36.520 --> 01:37.750
<I>That You Would</I>  <I>Take Care Of Daniel.</I>

01:37.910 --> 01:39.390
<I>Then You Didn't Take</I>  <I>Your Job Back.</I>

01:39.530 --> 01:41.920
<I>Deathbed--It Doesn't Get</I>  <I>Any Bigger Than That.</I>

01:42.090 --> 01:44.600
Okay,Maybe I Am A Little Guilty.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.750
But I Can't Go Back To "Mode."

01:46.930 --> 01:48.290
It Changes Me Too Much.

01:48.470 --> 01:49.890
And I'm Still Daniel's Friend.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.460
I'm Still Gonna Be There For Him.

01:51.610 --> 01:53.330
<I>I Hope So.</I>

01:53.490 --> 01:54.870
Look,I Promise,Okay?

01:55.030 --> 01:59.440
So Can You Disappear So I Can Go Back To D?

01:59.600 --> 02:02.310
<I>By Bed,You Mean</I>  <I>Finish These Empanadas?</I>

02:02.470 --> 02:03.000
Damn You,

02:03.180 --> 02:05.610
Subconscious Manifestation Of My Guilt.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.300
Okay,I Got The Christmas Ornaments And The Garland.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.520
The Lights Are Still Up In My Room From When

02:21.680 --> 02:24.990
I Turned My Closet Into A Nightclub. Sweetie,We're Not Decorating The Tree Today.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.530
We Do It This Day Every Year. Don't Worry,Justin.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.450
We're Still Trimming The Tree Today. Well,I Thought With Mr. Meade's Funeral,

02:30.600 --> 02:33.620
You Wouldn't Want To. No,We Have To. It's Mom's Tradition.

02:33.770 --> 02:37.680
Yeah. Grandpa,Help Me Set Up The Nativity Scene. Forget It.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.840
Mary,What Happened To Your Hair?

02:41.030 --> 02:42.930
So You Think Maybe, Once Things Calm Down,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.450
You're Gonna Go Back To Working At "Mode"? No,I Can't.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.180
Look,I've Been Thinking About Mom A Lot Lately,

02:48.330 --> 02:50.740
With The Funeral And The Holidays Coming.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.120
I Just Don't Think She Would Be Happy

02:52.290 --> 02:54.020
With The Person I Was Becoming At "Mode."

02:54.170 --> 02:56.010
Okay,But I Think She'd Be Happier If You Quit

02:56.160 --> 02:59.370
After You Got Your Christmas Bonus!

03:08.820 --> 03:11.470
Isn't This Plot Kind Of Big For Just Dad?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.720
It's Not Just Dad. It's For All Of Us.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.090
You Know, The Family Plot.

03:15.230 --> 03:17.950
Wait,What? Since When Do We Have A Family Plot?

03:18.110 --> 03:19.510
Since Forever. Oh,Wait.

03:19.670 --> 03:20.660
I Think You Were At Boarding School

03:20.840 --> 03:22.980
When Dad Bought It. Did You Not Think I Was Coming Back?

03:23.150 --> 03:24.180
I Mean,No One Thought To Tell Me,

03:24.350 --> 03:27.420
"Oh,Daniel,We Took Care Of Your Final Resting Place"?

03:27.590 --> 03:30.580
I Guess We Forgot. It Was Morbid. (Scoffs)

03:30.750 --> 03:33.170
Look At Daniel. He Just Looks So Upset.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.670
Yeah. Are We Getting Paid For Today?

03:35.840 --> 03:38.110
Christina, We're At A Funeral. Yeah,All Right.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.900
It's Just That The Memo Made It Sound Like It Was Mandatory.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.260
And Where's Henry? How Did He Get Out Of This?

03:43.420 --> 03:45.490
Well,He's At The Office. The Issue Ships Tonight,

03:45.640 --> 03:47.550
And All The Accounts Have To Close By The End Of The Day.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.720
What,So You're Telling Me He's Getting Time And A Half?

03:49.880 --> 03:51.060
Hey,Sheila. Great.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.270
Sheila,Who Do You Think's Gonna Take Over Meade Publications

03:54.420 --> 03:55.440
Now That Bradford's Gone?

03:55.600 --> 03:56.980
Mean,I Am Fey Sommers' Daughter.

03:57.130 --> 03:58.510
You Think It Could Be Me? Probably.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.460
I'm Sure Your Two Years As A Receptionist

04:00.630 --> 04:04.150
Qualifies You To Run The Whole Company. I Know,Right?

04:04.550 --> 04:06.590
(Police Siren Wails) Oh,Men In Uniform.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.410
Marc's Gonna Be So Pissed He Missed This.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.579
Must You Manhandle Me? I'm In Mourning Here.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.399
This Is My Husband's Funeral.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.440
Allow Me Some Dignity.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.690
Hi,Mom.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.630
Hi. How Are You?

04:30.030 --> 04:32.210
As We Lay My Father To Rest,

04:32.350 --> 04:35.790
In This Apparently Secret Family Plot,

04:35.960 --> 04:37.470
I Am Reminded

04:38.180 --> 04:40.340
That He Leaves Behind

04:40.910 --> 04:42.570
Some Big Shoes To Fill.

04:42.730 --> 04:46.340
Alexis And I Will Make Sure His Legacy Lives On.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.620
Now If... (Clears Throat)

04:50.760 --> 04:53.640
Anyone Else Would Like To Say Something...

05:00.400 --> 05:01.940
(Low Voice) No. No,No,No. Ple-Please.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.000
It's Nearly Over.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.420
Hi,I'm Betty Suarez,

05:13.570 --> 05:16.760
Um,And I-I Just Want To Say Something

05:16.910 --> 05:18.330
On Behalf Of All The Employees

05:18.480 --> 05:20.570
Who Worked For Mr. Meade.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.260
He Didn't Spend A Lot Of Time Talking To Us,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.760
And There Was A Time

05:25.920 --> 05:28.100
Where He Thought My Name Was Betsy--

05:29.210 --> 05:32.090
But I Do Know That He Loved His Family,

05:32.250 --> 05:33.960
And He Wasn't Just The Head Of A Company.

05:34.110 --> 05:37.630
He Was A Father And A Husband.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.150
(Wilhelmina) He Was Almost...

05:39.320 --> 05:40.580
<I>My</I> Husband.

05:40.730 --> 05:43.660
What Is She Doing Here? Who Is She Wearing?

05:43.820 --> 05:45.150
I Can't Believe She Came.

05:45.310 --> 05:46.110
What The Hell Are You Doing Here,

05:46.270 --> 05:49.480
Looking For Free Publicity? (Scoffs) I Don't Know What You're Talking About,Daniel.

05:49.650 --> 05:53.240
I'm An Emotional Wreck. I Just Came To Add A Few Words.

05:53.390 --> 05:57.140
After All,No One Loved Or Knew Bradford The Way I Did.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.880
Oh. Hello,Claire.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.070
Decided Not To Wear Black,I See.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.500
Motion To Terminate Wilhelmina Slater

06:12.660 --> 06:14.160
As Creative Director, "Mode Magazine,

06:14.290 --> 06:15.930
Effective Immediately.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.380
All Those In Favor?

06:17.540 --> 06:18.460
Aye. Aye.

06:18.630 --> 06:19.910
The Motion Carries.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.670
Rest In Peace,Bitch.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.620
Do They Actually Think I'd Go Without A Fight?

06:26.780 --> 06:29.260
Fools. If I've Saiit Once, I've Said It A Thousand Times.

06:29.410 --> 06:31.390
No One Pushes Wilhelmina Slater Into An Open Grave.

06:31.550 --> 06:34.110
Whoa,Hold On. You Got A Spider In Your Hair. Oh,Aah.

06:34.250 --> 06:34.880
I Got It.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.120
Perfect Fit. So Let Me Get This Straight.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.520
Wilhelmina Slater Was Pushed Into A Grave,

06:40.670 --> 06:42.460
And You Didn't Get One Picture?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.570
Mnh-Mnh. Way To Turn A Funeral Into A Tragedy.

06:44.740 --> 06:45.980
Are You Sure This Isn't Weird,

06:46.170 --> 06:49.170
Decorating The Tree Right After A Funeral? No. Not At All.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.870
Don't You Remember That Year We Decorated The Tree

06:51.030 --> 06:53.140
An Hour After Dad Passed His Kidney Stone?

06:53.300 --> 06:54.520
And Here It Is.

06:54.670 --> 06:57.000
Can We Put That In The Back This Year?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.860
I Always Feared That This Day

07:00.030 --> 07:02.870
Could Be A Possibility.

07:04.050 --> 07:08.430
But I Was Prepared.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.230
Marc,Must Do Something Now...

07:13.880 --> 07:16.570
Something Beautiful And Final,

07:16.710 --> 07:20.350
So They Will Never Forget We Were Here.

07:20.510 --> 07:22.650
Is This Gonna Be Some Kind Of Murder-Suicide Thing?

07:22.820 --> 07:26.110
'Cause Cliff And I Have "Chorus Line" Tickets Tonight.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.470
Willie,That Is <I>So</I> "Mission: Impossible Iii."

07:43.620 --> 07:44.980
Where's The Wallet I Gave You For Your Birthday?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.540
Oh,I Love It. It's So Soft And--

07:47.790 --> 07:50.760
Oh,My "Chorus Line" Tickets! What Are You Doing?

07:51.060 --> 07:54.260
Couldn't Take A Chance This Could Be Traced Back To Me.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.760
What Is That?

08:02.360 --> 08:04.900
Something The Pentagon Cooked Up.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.570
Date One Of The Joint Chiefs,

08:06.740 --> 08:09.220
Amazing The Access You'll Have.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.080
(Betty) See,That's What I'm Talking About--Tradition.

08:11.230 --> 08:14.180
<I>Papi's</I> Kidney Stone? All Of It,Hilda-- The Tree,

08:14.340 --> 08:15.850
My Popsicle Santa,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.430
Justin's Madonna And Child...

08:17.590 --> 08:19.130
Now Is That Rocco Or Lourdes?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.930
Lourdes. I Made Rocco The Star Of The Manger.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.820
Ready?

08:29.140 --> 08:30.490
Wait. I've Been Putting My Gym Membership

08:30.660 --> 08:33.080
On Your Credit Card For The Last Five Years.

08:33.230 --> 08:35.230
I Just Thought, You Know,If This Was It,

08:35.409 --> 08:38.659
I Wanna Go With A Clear Conscience. We Are Not Dyingmarc.

08:39.169 --> 08:40.750
"Mode" Is.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.929
That Place Is Gonna Fall Apart Without You.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.360
Hilda, They Don't Need Me.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.040
They've Been Putting Out That Magazine Forever.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.180
What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

09:16.480 --> 09:18.110
What? Oh,No.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.730
Whoa.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.210
It Is Done.

《丑女贝蒂》 第二季第9集

09:42.690 --> 09:44.870
Well,Really Nice Tree This Year.

09:45.030 --> 09:47.020
It's The Same Tree Every Year.

09:47.170 --> 09:51.030
But You Know What Would Be Really Nice? Hilda,Don't Even Get Started On That Pink Tree Again.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.610
You Know,You Didn't Even See It.

09:52.780 --> 09:55.020
Everyone At The Queens Center Mall Was Talking About It.

09:55.180 --> 09:56.730
That,And That Hot Puerto Rican Santa.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.220
(Whispers) They Had To Drag Me Off His Lap. Hilda.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.810
A Pink Tree Would Be <I>So</I> Kitsch.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.990
Pink Is The New Green. (Normal Voice) Yeah, Maybe With Some White Lights!

10:04.120 --> 10:07.790
And Tinsel. No. <I>No.</I> No,Guys. This Is Tradition.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.480
Okay. Okay. I Just Thought Maybe One Year,

10:10.630 --> 10:13.270
We Could Do Something Different. Get Off My Balls.

10:13.430 --> 10:16.500
Seriously, You're On My Balls.

10:21.530 --> 10:22.430
Hi,Henry. What's Up?

10:22.570 --> 10:24.750
(Henry) Betty,We've Lost The Entire Magazine.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.760
The Computers Have Crashed, And The Book Has Disappeared.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.300
Oh,My God.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.050
The Tech Guys Said All The Hard Drives Are Dead,

10:31.210 --> 10:32.900
Might As Well Bury 'Em.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.340
Oh,Sorry. Bad Day For That.

10:35.530 --> 10:39.090
They Weren't Able To Retrieve Anything? Yout,Editorial, Graphics... All Gone.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.410
The Issue Ships In 12 Hours.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.650
We Are Never Gonna Make Our Deadline. We Have To.

10:42.820 --> 10:43.910
This Magazine's Ready In Trouble.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.980
If We Can't Get Our Flagship Publication On The Stands...

10:46.140 --> 10:48.160
It Could Be The Final Nail In The Coffin.

10:48.620 --> 10:51.090
Oh,I Don't Know Why I Keep Saying These Things.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.660
Did You Guys Get My Flowers? It's Okay,Henry.

10:53.810 --> 10:54.940
How Could Wilhelmina Stoop So Low?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.790
I Can't Believe She Would Do Something Like This.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.310
You Know What? I'm Not Gonna Let Her Win.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.690
Henry,Start Making Calls. Get Everyone In Here.

11:01.850 --> 11:04.310
Actually, They're Already Here. (Daniel) What?

11:07.560 --> 11:09.420
I Called Everyone I Could Think Of.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.000
I Thought You Might Need Some Help.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.140
You're Back?

11:15.760 --> 11:17.960
For Tonight.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.340
Okay,According To Betty's Diagram,

11:23.510 --> 11:26.200
You Need More Lights In Quadrant Four.

11:26.350 --> 11:27.260
I Know What I'm Doing.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.040
<I>Mija,</I> You Don't. Look What You're Doing.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.880
You're Clumping Instead Of Draping.

11:31.050 --> 11:33.340
And More To The Right. You Know What, Mr. Drapey?

11:33.490 --> 11:34.850
If You Don't Like The Way I'm Doing It,

11:35.010 --> 11:39.690
Feel Free To Do It Yourself.  <I>Ay!</I> Ay-Yi-Yi-Yi! Hilda!

11:42.200 --> 11:43.760
It's Okay. It's Okay. Nothing's Broken.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.960
Look,The Naments Are Still In The Box.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.930
See? Mom's Angel's All Right.

11:50.190 --> 11:51.070
<I>Ay,</I> Chihuahua.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.240
Ooh,Betty's Gonna Kill You.

11:52.400 --> 11:52.970
Stop. Me?

11:53.110 --> 11:55.090
I'm Gonna Kill You Both. Whoa!

11:56.040 --> 11:57.880
Okay,I've Contacted The Freelancers,

11:58.040 --> 12:00.420
And They've Sent Us Drafts Of Winter Getaways,

12:00.580 --> 12:02.190
So How About The Cover?

12:02.350 --> 12:03.630
It's Gone.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.540
Well,Who Shot It? Desouza.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.840
We're Trying To Get Ahold Of His Reps,

12:07.010 --> 12:08.920
But They Can't Find Him. Okay,We Need That Cover.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.840
Stay On It,Betty. All Right? (Betty) Okay.

12:10.990 --> 12:14.600
Okay,Style And Beauty, Everyone. Present And Accounted For.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.980
My,My,My, Such Somber Faces.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.850
Did Somebody Die?

12:19.020 --> 12:20.490
I'm Gonna Kick Her Ass.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.650
Girl Fight... Kinda.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.670
Did You Come To Clean Out Your Office,Wilhelmina?

12:24.840 --> 12:27.220
No,Daniel. I Came To Clean Out Yours. (Laughs)

12:27.370 --> 12:29.320
People,I Am Seeking Greener Pastures,

12:29.470 --> 12:32.060
And So Can All Of You. (Snaps) Marc.

12:33.730 --> 12:36.050
"Slater," A Luxury Fashion Magazine

12:36.210 --> 12:39.170
For Trendsetters And Jet-Setters.

12:39.310 --> 12:40.510
Are You Kidding Me?

12:40.670 --> 12:42.360
We're Currently Setting Up Our Offices,

12:42.570 --> 12:44.820
And There Are Still Positions Available.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.840
So Who Would Like To Leave This Crumbling Dynasty?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.310
I Should Add That "Slater" Employees

12:50.470 --> 12:53.150
Will Receive A 15% Raise...

12:56.710 --> 12:57.870
(Betty) No.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.730
And Benefits Include Dental...

13:00.840 --> 13:02.400
What Are You Doing? Oh,I'm Joking,Henry.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.500
Just Wait.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.000
And... Cosmetic Surgery.

13:07.170 --> 13:08.100
Oh,Go! Go,Go,Go.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.300
(Betty) Amanda! Mm.

13:10.630 --> 13:12.330
No,Shame On You.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.540
Now As For The Rest Of You, Your Loyalty Is Admirable.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.920
You Remind Me Of The Orchestra

13:17.080 --> 13:20.080
That Stayed Behind To Play As The "Titanic" Sank.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.100
Get On The Boats,People. Don't Be Stupid.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.550
No. No,Don't Get On The Boats. We Don't Need Boats!

13:25.710 --> 13:27.310
This Magazine Is Not Sinking.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.720
Our Father Built "Mode."

13:28.890 --> 13:31.370
Alexis And I Are Gonna Continue His Legacy.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.370
Lovely Speech,Daniel. But Now That Your Father's Gone,

13:34.540 --> 13:35.810
You Should Know He Pretty Much Felt

13:35.960 --> 13:39.620
That You're An Incompetent Buffoon. That's It! Her Ass Is Getting Kicked!

13:39.760 --> 13:41.040
No,No,No,No,No. Ignore Her.

13:41.190 --> 13:43.790
And,As For You,Alexis,What Your Father Thout Of You...

13:43.950 --> 13:45.560
(Whispers) Circus Freak.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.860
Oh,That's It.

13:47.230 --> 13:50.480
(Normal Voice) I Look Forward To Seeing Your Issue On The Stands.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.830
And Your Fly Is Down.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.880
Made You Look.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.200
(Clears Throat) Come On.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.440
Come On.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.110
I'm Sorry,Marc.

14:05.260 --> 14:06.890
I Have To Stay.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
You Can't Be Serious.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.190
This Wasn't Just Bradford's Magazine.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.400
It Was Also My Mother's.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.790
(Sighs) Oh,Okay.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.170
Your Fly's Down,Too. What?

14:17.330 --> 14:18.700
(Laughs) Oh.

14:20.180 --> 14:22.170
This Is Just So Wrong.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.200
She Can't Do This.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.880
But She Did.

14:28.710 --> 14:30.040
I Don't Know How Long I'm Gonna Be Here,

14:30.200 --> 14:32.130
So I Was Just Calling To Check In,

14:32.290 --> 14:33.400
See How You're Making Out With The Tree.

14:33.550 --> 14:38.200
How Does It Look? It's Hot. It's Very Hot. It's Smoking.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.250
What's Going On?

14:40.410 --> 14:41.730
Nothing. Hilda.

14:41.900 --> 14:42.820
Nothing. Okay,See,No.

14:42.970 --> 14:45.180
You're Doing That--That Lying Thing With Your Voice,

14:45.330 --> 14:46.700
Like When You Were Four Months Pregnant,

14:46.870 --> 14:47.610
And You Kept Telling Dad,

14:47.780 --> 14:51.990
"No,I'm Just Bloated And Gassy." Okay,But I Don't Want You Freaking Out.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.310
I Still See Some Smoke. The Christmas Tree Might Have Caught

14:54.470 --> 14:56.040
A Little Bit On Fire. Fire?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.740
Yeah,But It's Okay. Nobody Got Hurt.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.500
We Put It Out With An Extinguisher. No Big Deal.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.820
Well,What About The Ornaments? Are They--Are They Okay?

15:01.980 --> 15:04.210
Popsicle Santa-- He's Made Of Wood.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.420
Yeah,Well,At Least He Went Quickly.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.720
But We Saved The Angel, And That Was Mom's Favorite,

15:09.880 --> 15:12.000
So Really,That Was The Most Important One.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.250
Now Listen,I Don't Want To Point Fingers Here,

15:14.400 --> 15:17.470
But If We Had Gone With The Flame-Resistant Pink One-- Aah!

15:17.640 --> 15:20.690
All Right. No Pink Tree, Jeez. Call You Later.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.770
Okay.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.680
What Are You Doing Here?

15:25.830 --> 15:27.160
Will You Please Just Leave Me Alone?

15:27.310 --> 15:31.750
'Cause I Don't Feel Guilty About Anything. Look In There. My Son Is Having A Crisis.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.340
Isn't This Normally Where You Give

15:33.500 --> 15:35.180
One Of Your Annoying Pep Talks?

15:35.340 --> 15:38.460
Look,I Don't Know How To Fix This. You Don't Have To Fix It.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.420
He Just Needs To Know That You're There.

15:40.570 --> 15:44.860
Now Go,And Maybe Your Cute Little Kitten Screen Saver

15:45.030 --> 15:46.190
Doesn't Get Hurt.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.840
<I>縂Atito?</I>  <I>(Kitten Meows)</I>

15:48.050 --> 15:50.370
Okay. Okay,Okay,Okay. I'm Going.

15:55.530 --> 15:56.670
How You Doing?

15:56.830 --> 15:59.650
Wilhelmina's Right. My Father Said I Couldn't Do This.

15:59.810 --> 16:02.110
You Are So Wrong, Daniel.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.290
Your Father Believes In You.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.400
It's Brilliant.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.920
The Day We Bury Him, The Magazine Dies.

16:08.070 --> 16:09.650
Look,Daniel, If You Want To Keep

16:09.810 --> 16:10.930
Your Father's Legacy Alive,

16:11.080 --> 16:12.840
Then You Need To Step Up.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.080
It's Like You Said In Your Eulogy,

16:16.230 --> 16:18.880
You <I>Promised</I> To Fill His Shoes.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.530
That Was Easy To Say.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.410
And Hard To Do. I Know.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.780
My Mom Was All About Tradition--

16:26.420 --> 16:29.390
New Sweaters Whenever We Went Back To School,

16:29.810 --> 16:31.520
Blue Spruce Tree With Colored Lights

16:31.680 --> 16:33.140
Every Christmas,

16:33.300 --> 16:36.560
And For Our Birthdays, She Always Made Tamales.

16:36.730 --> 16:37.730
That Was The Toughest Part,

16:37.890 --> 16:41.150
Because She Died Right Before My Dad's Birthday,

16:41.310 --> 16:43.180
And We Were All Pretty Much A Mess.

16:43.340 --> 16:46.840
And As Hard As It Was, I Stepped Up.

16:47.010 --> 16:49.550
Now I Make Them Every Year.

16:49.980 --> 16:51.680
And I Like To Think That In Some Small Way,

16:51.840 --> 16:53.900
That Keeps Her Alive.

16:57.490 --> 16:59.880
Don't You Think I Want To Do That For Him?

17:00.850 --> 17:03.050
Wilhelmina Took Everyone. There's No One Left.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.190
No One? No.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.810
Daniel,You Have Sheila,A Great Editor,

17:08.970 --> 17:12.089
Veronica, A Very Good Art Director--

17:12.250 --> 17:13.680
Oh,And,Ooh,Henry,

17:13.849 --> 17:15.400
He's A Cute Accountant--

17:15.560 --> 17:18.030
And Seven Very Able Assistants

17:18.190 --> 17:19.089
Who Can Do A Lot More For You

17:19.240 --> 17:21.480
Than Get You Your Coffee.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.030
You're Right.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.329
Let's Go Make Tamales.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.060
Okay,Everyone, We Have Been Wasting Time.

17:34.210 --> 17:36.060
Sorry,<I>I</I> Have Been Wasting Time.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.800
First Of All,My Father Would Be Touched

17:37.960 --> 17:38.990
To See That You All Stayed.

17:39.150 --> 17:42.480
Your Loyalty To "Mode" Means A Lot. Whoo! Yeah,"Mode!"

17:42.650 --> 17:45.090
Yes! Exactly. Yay,"Mode." We Have To Stay Positive.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.320
I Know This Seems Daunting.

17:46.470 --> 17:49.840
I Also Know That We Can Do This. Yes,We Can Do This!

17:50.000 --> 17:52.740
Uh,Betty? We're Actually Okay. Thanks.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.050
Alexis, Where Do We Stand?

17:54.210 --> 17:55.610
We Recovered Most Of Our Advertising,

17:55.750 --> 17:58.020
Which Leaves 83 Pages Of Content To Fill

17:58.170 --> 18:01.140
Before We Can Ship. Okay,All Right. All Right,83.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.280
Amanda,Will You Write That Number On The Board?

18:04.010 --> 18:07.670
Christina,What Do We Have Left Over From The Prada Shoot? Just A Few Bits.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.250
Great,Let's Pull Them All Then. Yeah,Which Is Fine, 'Cause They're At Home.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.020
But Can Get Them. Just Walk Along.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.600
Great. Uh,Betty, What's The Last Book You Read?

18:15.740 --> 18:17.660
Um,"Knuffle Bunny."

18:17.810 --> 18:19.160
What? I Was Babysitting.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.770
Give Me 500 Words On That.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.960
I Don't Think There Are Even 500 Words In The Whole Book. I'm Sure You--

18:23.110 --> 18:25.480
Okay,But I'm On It. I'm On It. Okay.

18:25.630 --> 18:28.370
Oh,What About Henry? He's Very Artistic.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.740
He Is The Only Person I Know Who Can Keep An Orchid Alive.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.250
And,And--Oh,He's Really Good At Chinese Cooking.

18:34.410 --> 18:35.680
Wait,You Liked My Cashew Chicken?

18:35.830 --> 18:37.620
Why Didn't You Eat It? 'Cause I Don't Like Asparagus.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.450
Well,I Didn't Have To Make It With Asparagus. I Know,But I--

18:39.620 --> 18:42.600
Guys! Henry,Just Type It Up.  <I>U</I> Are Our New Food Editor.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.340
Perfect. We're Editors.

18:46.580 --> 18:49.510
Okay,I Think We're Going To Need This.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.590
What Now? Just Got Off The Phone With The Printer.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.770
He Said The Latest He Could Push

18:52.930 --> 18:55.740
The Run Of The Issue Is 2:00 A.M. Did You Explain The Situation?

18:55.890 --> 18:57.810
He Didn't Care, But He Did Say

18:57.970 --> 19:00.120
I Sounded Like I Had Great Boobs.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.260
(Sighs) I Know This Guy-- Arthur Kaplan. Total Dog.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.350
I Think I Can Get Him To Extend Our Deadline.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.240
Let Me Go Change Into Something A Little More Persuasive.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.580
Are You Sure You Want To Do That? We've Got To Get This Issue Out.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.350
If I Can Get These Things To Save The Magazine,

19:12.520 --> 19:17.250
Maybe I Can Finally Write Them Off. Um,That's Actually Not A Legitimate Business Expense.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.150
Okay,I've Got A Rough Sketch Of The Front-Of-Book Graphics.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.720
Good. Just Put It Up On The Board.

19:21.890 --> 19:25.530
All Right. Six Pages. Amanda,Take Us Down,Please.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.180
77,Einstein.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.610
* Step It Up *

19:32.900 --> 19:34.700
* Step It Up *

19:35.320 --> 19:36.910
* Step It Up *

19:37.240 --> 19:39.510
* Step It Up *

19:39.660 --> 19:40.750
* Step It Up *

19:41.420 --> 19:43.190
* Step It Up *

19:43.640 --> 19:46.440
Listen,Daniel,Um,It's Not That I Don't Love My Job

19:46.650 --> 19:48.760
Of Writing And Erasing Numbers From That Board,

19:48.930 --> 19:49.700
But I Just Wish There Was A Way

19:49.890 --> 19:51.810
I Could Contribute More Tonight.

19:52.030 --> 19:57.200
Okay,Um,What Do You Want To Do? Well,Um,Fey Sommers Was My Mother.

19:57.370 --> 19:57.750
Really?

19:57.900 --> 20:00.480
'Cause You Haven't Mentioned That In Three Minutes.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.320
(Nick) Hey!

20:01.480 --> 20:02.930
I Just--I Think Maybe I Inherited

20:03.090 --> 20:05.470
Some Of Her Creative Instincts.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.610
Um,You're In Charge Of Thewhat's Hot?" Section. (Groans)

20:08.770 --> 20:11.000
Wait,Really? Oh,My God, People Actually Read Tha Mm-Hmm.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.150
This Is Huge. I Just Got Promoted.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.030
Who Wants To Go Out And Celebrate? (Laughs)

20:15.180 --> 20:17.080
I'm Just Kidding. Hey,Sheila,Walk With Me.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.730
Did That Sound Professional? (Scoffs)

20:18.890 --> 20:21.010
I've Got An Update On The Cover. (Daniel) Oh,Good.

20:21.150 --> 20:24.090
Not Good. The Photographer's On A 16-Hour Flight To Australia,

20:24.250 --> 20:26.930
And We Can't Get The Negatives. Oh,We're Screwed.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.370
No. No,We're Not Screwed. We're In The Homestretch.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.010
We Have A Studio Here. Why Don't We Just Shoot Another Cover?

20:33.170 --> 20:35.970
Because We Sold The Advertisers On A Cameron Ashlock Cover.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.470
The Cover Sells The Entire Magazine.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.670
I Mean,She's Huge-- She's Got A Movie,An Album,

20:39.820 --> 20:42.840
A Perfume Coming Out... Daniel,Why Don't We Just Find Her

20:43.010 --> 20:45.530
And Shoot The Cover Again? That Could Be A Problem.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.070
You Didn't Hear About Her Meltdown?

20:47.230 --> 20:48.850
Apparently America's Sweetheart Was A Little Bit

20:49.000 --> 20:51.310
Under The Influence When She Did "Larry King."

20:51.450 --> 20:55.060
Is She In Jail Or Rehab? Rehab. Safe Haven Hospital On 56th Street.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.150
Okay, Why Don't We Try

20:56.290 --> 20:59.260
And Get Her Released For A Couple Of Hours? No,Daniel. That's Not How Rehab Works.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.180
Okay. All Right. Uh,Plan "B."

21:02.590 --> 21:04.730
I Want You Guys To Keep Working On These Pages.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.630
I'm Gonna Take Care Of This Cover.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.840
Daniel,What Do You Have In Mind?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.710
We're Gonna Break Her Out Of Rehab.

21:12.860 --> 21:13.730
No.

21:22.310 --> 21:25.310
Okay,You See Why I Don't Want To Come Back To "Mode"?

21:25.440 --> 21:27.420
We Are Breaking An Actress Out Of Rehab,

21:27.580 --> 21:30.570
And We Just Paid A Bodyguard $1,000 To Get In Here.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.530
Actually... (Clears Throat) It Was $2,000.

21:32.680 --> 21:33.300
Oh,Well...

21:33.450 --> 21:36.150
This Is It. Go Ahead.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.920
Hi.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.260
Sorry To Bother You, Cameron,Uh--

21:46.400 --> 21:47.050
Wait A Minute.

21:47.190 --> 21:50.430
You're Not The Cute Bipolar Boy I Was Gonna Make Out With.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.190
We Just Need To Talk To You.

21:52.650 --> 21:53.770
Who Are You?

21:53.940 --> 21:55.490
And How Did You Even Know I Was Here?

21:55.670 --> 21:58.200
Oh,Everyone Knows You're Here. It's All Over The News.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.210
I Have Got  <I>Such</I> A Good Publicist.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.080
I Mean,So Worth The Money. (Laughs)

22:14.780 --> 22:16.850
(Singsongy Voice) Oh,Arthur.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.390
Hello.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.160
Alexis Meade Is Here.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.130
I Know You're Working Late,

22:24.300 --> 22:25.190
So I Thought I'd Bring You

22:25.340 --> 22:28.120
A Little Midnight Snack.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.940
Whoa. Damn.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.400
You Are One Big Girl. Mm.

22:32.570 --> 22:34.980
You're Not Arthur. Arthur Called It Quits Last Spring.

22:35.130 --> 22:36.320
I'm Harvey Milfree.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.000
Look At The Size Of Those Feet.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.340
How Do You Find Shoes?

22:41.510 --> 22:44.730
I'm Alexis Meade, For "Mode" Magazine. Oh,Yeah. Your People Called.

22:44.890 --> 22:47.160
We're Not Pushing Your Deadline. Oh,Come On.

22:47.310 --> 22:50.050
We Just Need A Couple Of Hours. We're Shorthanded.

22:50.810 --> 22:52.810
"Shorthanded." Nice.

22:52.970 --> 22:55.840
Real Nice. Make Fun Of A Little Person.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.050
No,I'm Not.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.530
And Why Is It Okay For You To Make Fun Of Me For Being Tall?

22:59.700 --> 23:01.590
Tall? You're A Monster.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.270
In Fact, You're Scaring Me.

23:03.430 --> 23:05.060
Now I'm Gonna Have To Sleep With The Lights On.

23:05.210 --> 23:06.290
Good Night.

23:06.450 --> 23:09.630
You Are So Rude. Our Magazine Is In Trouble.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.310
I Came All The Way Over Here To Reason With You. No,You Didn't.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.910
You Came All The Way Over Here To Get Arthur

23:16.060 --> 23:18.320
To Keep This Place Open By Showing Your Jugs.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.320
But As Soon As You Saw It Was Me,

23:20.490 --> 23:21.440
You Covered 'Em Up.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.960
That's Not True. I Was Just Startled.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.630
Then Show 'Em To Me. No. I'm Not Showing You Anything.

23:27.770 --> 23:30.190
Come On. Just A Little Peek,Eh?

23:30.360 --> 23:32.770
I Have A Better Idea.

23:34.890 --> 23:38.510
You,Me And The Girls Stay Inside.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.170
"Mode" Magazine.

23:46.330 --> 23:48.010
Yeah,I Think I Did The Cover...

23:48.180 --> 23:49.500
And Probably The Photographer.

23:49.670 --> 23:50.860
I Usually Do. (Laughs)

23:51.120 --> 23:52.730
We Actually Met On The Shoot.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.650
Uh,I-I Got You Coffee. Uh,You Threw It At Me,

23:55.810 --> 23:58.070
And Then You Filled The Cup With Vodka.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.860
(Laughs) Classic Me. Hee.

24:01.290 --> 24:05.250
But That Was The Old Cameron. I'm Clean And Sober Now,

24:05.410 --> 24:09.010
And Since I've Been Here, I've Totally Found God.

24:09.150 --> 24:13.410
Well,That's--That's Great. And He Really <I>Touches</I> Me.

24:13.560 --> 24:17.780
You Know,I Mean,But,Like... Not In A Sexual Way?

24:17.930 --> 24:19.710
Okay,So,Um,Listen.

24:19.870 --> 24:20.930
Cameron, We're Kind Of In A Bind.

24:21.110 --> 24:23.170
I Know This Is, Um,Unorthodox... (Exhales)

24:23.380 --> 24:25.690
But There Was A Very Big Screwup

24:25.850 --> 24:27.690
At The Magazine. Oh!

24:27.850 --> 24:31.120
I Was Just Wondering If There's Any Chance

24:31.270 --> 24:32.840
We Could Convince You To Reshoot The Cover.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.890
Like,Tonight?

24:37.030 --> 24:38.080
Are You Crazy?

24:38.240 --> 24:42.700
I'm In A Really Intensive 6-Week Recovery Program Here.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.170
So There's Just No Way.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.430
Cameron,

24:45.590 --> 24:48.400
Let's--Let's Talk About This.

24:48.780 --> 24:53.120
Isn't A Really Big Part Of This Making Amends?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.670
I Mean, You Do Owe Us.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.720
You Were Kind Of Mn The First Time.

24:57.870 --> 25:00.310
This Could Be Your Chance To-- To Make Up For It...

25:00.470 --> 25:03.060
To Get Closer To God.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.950
Yes. Yes.

25:05.090 --> 25:08.710
Yeah,And I-I Guess I Did Kinda Pee In Someone's Chair

25:08.860 --> 25:10.570
Because I Thought It Was A Bathroom.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.080
Oh,That Was My Chair.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.350
Classic You.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.740
Yes,Totally.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.340
(Wilhelmina) Attention,Everyone,Attention.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.890
I'd Like To Congratulate You

25:23.050 --> 25:25.720
On Making The Best Decision Of Your Lives.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.640
I'm So Happy To Have You All Here With Me.

25:28.780 --> 25:31.120
Uh,Except For You, Florence.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.680
I Thought It Was Obvious The Way I Felt About You.

25:39.910 --> 25:42.630
As Of Tomorrow Morning, Financing For My,Um--

25:42.770 --> 25:43.450
Ahem.

25:43.620 --> 25:46.020
Ah,<I>Our</I> Magazine...

25:46.180 --> 25:47.310
Will Be Secure,

25:47.460 --> 25:50.540
And The Age Of "Slater" Will Officially Commence.

25:50.830 --> 25:52.750
(Laughs) To World Dination.

25:54.090 --> 25:56.210
Uh,To "Slater."

25:56.380 --> 25:58.020
(All) To "Slater."

25:58.390 --> 26:00.520
Now Enjoy The Complimentary Cheese--

26:00.670 --> 26:02.150
Two Pieces Each.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.100
Wilhemommy, One Question--

26:05.260 --> 26:07.650
You Know I Usually Jump Right On Board Your Schemes,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.530
Strap Myself In And Enjoy The Ride,

26:09.690 --> 26:11.370
But Where <I>Are</I> We Getting The Money

26:11.520 --> 26:13.000
To Launch This Magazine...

26:13.160 --> 26:15.760
Without Meade Publications Behind Us?

26:15.930 --> 26:18.420
Well,Since My Sugar Daddy Kicked It Early,

26:18.580 --> 26:21.390
I'm Going To Turn To My Own Daddy. (Chuckles)

26:21.560 --> 26:23.930
What's That Smirk For? Just That You Have A Father.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.090
I Always Imagined You Rising Out Of A Cauldron

26:26.240 --> 26:28.480
Or Born Of A Jackal.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.910
(Laughs) You're So Sweet.

26:31.070 --> 26:32.700
You Get An Extra Piece Of Cheese. Oh!

26:32.850 --> 26:35.280
Oh,My God,Daniel, That's Great.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.740
I Knew You Could Do It.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.540
Hey,And Wilhelmina Was Wrong.

26:38.710 --> 26:41.790
Dad Would Be So Proud Of You. Well,He'd Be Proud Of You,Too.

26:41.950 --> 26:44.420
You Know That,Right? Yeah,Yeah. Of Course.

26:44.580 --> 26:45.930
How's It Goin' At The Printer?

26:46.090 --> 26:47.990
You Get Them To Move The Deadline Yet?

26:48.160 --> 26:50.890
We're Still, Uh,Negotiating.

26:50.950 --> 26:55.300
Excuse Me, This Is Not Negotiating.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.850
(Grunts) It's Kidnapping.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.360
Milfree,You Have To Do This For Us.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.340
He Practically Has The Issue Finished.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.340
You Have No Idea What We've Been Through.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.530
Oh,Poor,Pretty Rich Girl's Got Problems.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.300
Boohoo!

27:11.470 --> 27:13.400
As A Matter Of Fact, I Do.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.400
So What Do You Think? Much Better Than I Expected.

27:17.540 --> 27:18.210
Excuse Me.

27:18.360 --> 27:19.750
Wee Bit Of A Problem With Our Cover Girl.

27:19.910 --> 27:21.410
Cameron Said She's Not Gonna Come Out Of The Dressing Room

27:21.570 --> 27:24.190
Until She Gets Some Booze Or Drugs. What?

27:24.350 --> 27:26.200
What About God? Oh,Yeah. She Mentioned Him. She Said...

27:26.370 --> 27:27.950
(Imitates Cameron) "God, I Need Some Booze Or Drugs."

27:28.100 --> 27:30.210
I Knew It Was A Bad Idea To Get Her Out.

27:30.370 --> 27:32.880
Look,Maybe We Should Call Her Mother Or Her Makeup Artist.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.090
Who Do You Think She's Closer To? Makeup Artist.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.930
That Whole Thing With Her Mother... Nuh. Daniel. Daniel, What Are You Doing?

27:37.090 --> 27:40.570
I'm Gonna Fix This. How?

27:41.150 --> 27:42.340
I'm Gonna Give Her A Ink.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.920
It's The Cover,Betty. It's What My Father Would Do.  <I>It's True.</I>

27:48.300 --> 27:49.040
You're The One Who Said

27:49.190 --> 27:51.340
To Follow In His Footsteps. But I--

27:51.500 --> 27:54.560
Tell The Photographer She'll Be Out In Ten Minutes.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.010
Where Are Your Pages?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.520
(Mumbles) I Don't Know. So You Have Nothing.

28:06.670 --> 28:09.220
They Can't Close The Front Half Of The Book

28:09.360 --> 28:11.520
Unless We Have The "What's Hot?" Section.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.490
(Normal Voice) I'll Get To It.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.230
Are You Kidding Me?

28:15.380 --> 28:17.610
I'm Waiting For Inspiration To Strike.

28:17.770 --> 28:19.820
That's What My Mother, Fey Sommers,Always Did.

28:19.970 --> 28:20.600
Her Motto Was,

28:20.770 --> 28:23.650
"Inspiration, Not Perspiration."

28:23.800 --> 28:25.080
I Hate My Life.

28:25.230 --> 28:27.480
I'm Gonna Go To My Office And Self-Medicate.

28:27.630 --> 28:31.010
I'll Be Back In An Hour... Or Thursday.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.730
Hey,I'll Come Through.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.930
My Mom...

28:35.940 --> 28:38.250
Wait,Not Perspiration,

28:38.400 --> 28:39.900
Inspiration.

28:40.060 --> 28:42.680
Someone Here Order 12 Pizzas?

28:50.340 --> 28:53.750
Oh,You Are <I>Just</I> What I've Been Waiting For.

28:53.910 --> 28:55.240
Finally.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.680
A Hot Chick With A Delivery Boy Fantasy.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.820
Oh,No,No,No.

28:58.980 --> 29:01.240
I Need A Favor That's Not Sexual.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.610
Take Off Your Pants.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.420
So You Just Went And...

29:07.710 --> 29:10.220
Well,They Billed Me For A 14-Hour Surgery,

29:10.370 --> 29:12.650
So I Certainly Hope They Did More Than That.

29:12.810 --> 29:15.930
And Your Family Was Like, "Hey,It's A Girl."

29:16.110 --> 29:17.440
Not Exactly.

29:17.610 --> 29:18.400
My Mother Was Pretty Good,

29:18.590 --> 29:20.510
And,Actually, My Brother Was Okay,

29:20.680 --> 29:22.440
But My Father...

29:23.690 --> 29:25.550
To Be Honest, I Don't Know.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.080
I-I Thought He Got There, But Now...

29:29.250 --> 29:30.310
What?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.630
Someone Said Something To Me Today

29:32.780 --> 29:35.560
That Made Me Question Everything.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.210
You Know, When I Was 10,

29:37.380 --> 29:38.870
My Father Sold Me To The Circus.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.320
Oh,My God. Harvey,That's Horrible.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.110
Wait A Minute...

29:44.560 --> 29:46.230
Okay,Not Exactly,

29:46.400 --> 29:48.340
But You Wouldn't Believe How Much

29:48.500 --> 29:50.440
Big Harvey's Scored With That Line.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.220
You Are One Twisted Mister.

29:53.370 --> 29:55.230
Hey,It Takes One To Know One,Huh?

29:55.590 --> 29:57.850
But I Know Where You're Coming From.

29:58.010 --> 29:59.650
Believe It Or Not, I Wasn't The Kid

29:59.810 --> 30:02.740
My Father Imagined Having, Either.

30:04.570 --> 30:08.780
I Wasted So Much Time Trying To Win Him Over.

30:09.830 --> 30:12.170
And Then Finally, I Just Said,

30:12.340 --> 30:16.150
"To Hell With It. This Is Who I Am."

30:18.030 --> 30:21.330
Yeah,Well, My Father's Dead.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.410
There's No One To Say "To Hell With It" To.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.480
Exactly,  You're Free.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.280
Now It Only Matters What <I>You</I> Think.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.720
If You Wanna Go,

30:37.890 --> 30:39.430
You Can Go.

30:39.870 --> 30:42.730
Looks Like We're Not Gonna Be Making Our Deadline.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.620
You Know What? What's Another Hour?

30:48.780 --> 30:51.090
I Might Be Able To Move Around My Other Magazines.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.810
Sit Down.

30:54.140 --> 30:56.210
Pass Me A Grape. You Got It.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.110
And Now, As A Little Thank-You,

30:59.470 --> 31:00.570
You Might Wanna Show Me Your--

31:00.740 --> 31:02.390
No,Harvey, I Do Not.

31:07.860 --> 31:08.810
Hey.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.750
I Finished My Recipe. I Left Out The Cumin.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.490
Something Martha Taught Me-- Never Give It All Away.

31:14.630 --> 31:16.160
Now Where's Daniel? I Have To Have Him Sign Off On This.

31:16.310 --> 31:19.040
He's In Cameron's Dressing Room... Enabling.

31:19.190 --> 31:21.780
He's Sleeping With Her? Man,He's Good.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.440
Uh,Uh,I Mean In Aad,Bad Way.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.010
No,He's Giving Her A Drink.

31:26.170 --> 31:28.410
This Shoot Sucks!

31:44.080 --> 31:46.790
Don't Touch Me,Pigs! Maybe That Drink Wasn't Such A Good Idea.

31:46.950 --> 31:48.260
I'm America's Frean' Sweetheart!

31:48.420 --> 31:49.640
Don't Hurt Her. Aah!

31:49.800 --> 31:52.020
And How Come No One's Taking My Picture?

31:53.920 --> 31:56.090
Amanda Is Never Going To Come Through,

31:56.260 --> 31:59.260
So I Say We Just Kill This "What's Hot?" Section,

31:59.430 --> 32:01.950
And We Pad "The Quick And Easy Styling Tips."

32:02.090 --> 32:03.020
But That's Just It.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.730
They're Quick And Easy.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.230
There's Not Much To Say.

32:06.390 --> 32:10.310
Not So Fast. Inspiration Has Struck. Whew.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.410
Ladies And Gentlemen, I Present To You

32:13.580 --> 32:15.460
January's Issue Of...

32:15.630 --> 32:18.030
* "What Hot?" *

32:18.210 --> 32:21.390
Ow! (Beatboxes) Click.

32:26.190 --> 32:29.100
It's... (Makes Sizzling Sound) Hot...

32:29.300 --> 32:30.620
(Imitates Echo) Hot,Hot,Hot,

32:30.800 --> 32:32.380
Hot,Hot.

32:32.540 --> 32:33.680
I Know.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.220
Amanda, I Knew Fey Sommers.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.040
I Worked With Fey Sommers.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.350
I Once Made Out With Fey Sommers.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.160
Amanda...

32:44.320 --> 32:47.070
<I>You</I> Are No Fey Sommers.

32:47.240 --> 32:51.460
Kid,I Think It's Time You Went Back To The Phones.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.370
"Easy Tips" It Is.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.490
All Right.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.950
I Know That You're Down,

33:06.110 --> 33:09.680
And That It's Probably Not The Best Time For Me To Lecture,

33:09.900 --> 33:12.400
But In What World Did Giving An Alcoholic

33:12.570 --> 33:15.850
A Bottle Of Vodka Seem Like The Right Thing To Do?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.370
My Father's World,

33:17.530 --> 33:19.120
But Not Mine.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.860
I Went To Give Her The Drink,

33:21.010 --> 33:23.630
But I Couldn't Do It.

33:23.790 --> 33:26.270
She Didn't Take It Very Well,Obviously.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.730
Wait,You Mean,You Did-- You Didn't--You Didn't-- No.

33:28.890 --> 33:31.250
Daniel,That's Great. Is It?

33:31.600 --> 33:32.370
I Lost Our Cover.

33:32.530 --> 33:33.850
Without Our Cover, There's No Issue.

33:34.010 --> 33:35.680
I Mean, Let's Face It,Betty.

33:37.150 --> 33:39.110
I Am No Bradford Meade.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.030
Ugh,No,You're Not.

33:42.870 --> 33:45.410
But Maybe That's A Good Thing.

33:45.670 --> 33:47.720
I Mean,You've Got A Whole Blank Slate.

33:47.870 --> 33:50.030
You Can Stop Thinking About What Bradford Meade Would Do.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.370
What Would Daniel Meade Do?

33:55.050 --> 33:57.900
What? What? You're Staring At Me.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.020
No,I'm Just Thinking About Something You Said.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.480
Really?

34:01.940 --> 34:02.550
What Did I Say?

34:02.710 --> 34:04.400
Because Seriously, I'm... (Yawns)

34:04.560 --> 34:05.790
So Tired Right Now,

34:05.940 --> 34:07.930
I Don't Know What Came Out Of My Mouth.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.770
Make Sure Nobody Leaves.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.670
I Think I May Have Found Our Cover.

34:16.810 --> 34:18.080
Wait.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.670
Come On.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.790
Tell Me What I Said.

34:26.610 --> 34:29.570
So,Ladies And Gentlemen, I Present To You

34:29.719 --> 34:31.739
The January Cover.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.719
Oh,It's A-- It's A Foldout,Too.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.380
Thank You.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.159
Thank You.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.350
(Sheila) Nice Work,Daniel.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.590
We Sold The Advertisers On A Big,Bold Cover.

35:00.740 --> 35:01.710
I Think This Is It.

35:01.870 --> 35:06.240
Issue Number 4-1-2 Is Ready To Ship!

35:06.580 --> 35:08.280
Oh,No,Uh,0-0-1.

35:08.430 --> 35:09.320
I Think After 40 Years,

35:09.470 --> 35:12.240
It's About Time For A New Legacy.

35:12.690 --> 35:16.940
Whatever. Let's Just Get This Bitch Out! Oh!

35:18.460 --> 35:20.250
Good Job. You Did It. Thank You.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.320
Okay,You Made Me Cry.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.310
Well,It Was Your Whole Blank Slate Thing

35:27.470 --> 35:29.040
That Gave Me The Idea.

35:29.190 --> 35:31.650
Thank You Very Much.

35:32.670 --> 35:36.300
You Know,Betty, You're Really Good At This.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.890
You Sure You Don't Want To Come Back?

35:40.160 --> 35:41.650
I Can't.

35:43.610 --> 35:44.680
My Mother Would Never Approve

35:44.860 --> 35:47.170
Of The Person I Was Becoming Here.

35:47.350 --> 35:49.170
I Was Changing.

35:49.370 --> 35:50.970
Hey,Hey.

35:51.730 --> 35:53.540
You're Growing Up.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.520
It Doesn't Matter What You Do For A Living.

35:55.670 --> 35:58.600
You're Always Gonna Have Tough Choices To Make,Betty.

35:59.910 --> 36:02.140
I Really Think You Can Stay Here

36:02.290 --> 36:04.200
And Still Be The Person You Want To Be--

36:04.340 --> 36:07.860
Someone Your Mother Would Be <I>So</I> Proud Of.

36:09.340 --> 36:11.880
You're Not Gonna Start Crying Again,Are You?

36:12.150 --> 36:13.460
(Voice Breaks) No.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.510
Yes.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.960
Thanks For Coming So Quickly,Daddy.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.180
I Really Needed You.

36:22.330 --> 36:25.250
You Haven't Said That To Me Since You Were A Little Girl.

36:25.590 --> 36:28.060
I'm Sorry About Bradford.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.660
I'm Devastated.

36:29.810 --> 36:31.600
Consequently, I'm Moving On With My Life,

36:31.750 --> 36:34.230
And Starting A New Magazine.

36:34.380 --> 36:38.110
So... Why Am I Here?

36:38.960 --> 36:41.080
I Need Seed Money--

36:41.260 --> 36:43.080
Just A 6-Month Swingoan.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.320
I'll Pay You Back In Full, Give You Gross Participation...

36:46.480 --> 36:48.880
That's Real Money From The First Issue On.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.060
Where Is She?

36:50.220 --> 36:52.690
Marc? She's Right There Making Omelets.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.760
Scallions,Senator?

36:55.470 --> 36:57.710
I'm Talking About You.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.270
Whatever Happened To Wanda?

36:59.430 --> 37:00.560
Oh,She's Still Here,

37:00.740 --> 37:03.080
Just... Prettier.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.460
I'm Not So Sure.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.620
Uh,What Are You Talking About?

37:07.790 --> 37:09.420
You Always Pushed Me To Be Successful,

37:09.580 --> 37:11.330
And I Want To Start A Magazine,

37:11.480 --> 37:12.920
So What's The Problem?

37:13.070 --> 37:15.990
You Buried Your Fianc? 12 Hours Ago.

37:16.130 --> 37:17.450
You Tell Me.

37:17.620 --> 37:18.390
This Is Rich--

37:18.550 --> 37:21.860
You Giving Me A Lecture On Compassion.

37:22.010 --> 37:22.900
You Know What? Let's Just Forget

37:23.060 --> 37:24.630
That This Is A Daughter Talking To Her Father,

37:24.780 --> 37:26.800
'Cause We Both Forgot That Years Ago.

37:26.950 --> 37:30.540
Bottom Line Is You Can Make A Fortune Off This Magazine.

37:32.610 --> 37:34.120
I'm Sorry.

37:34.270 --> 37:35.620
I Am Just Not Interested

37:35.760 --> 37:37.650
In Investing In A World

37:37.810 --> 37:39.380
That Turned You Into...

37:40.430 --> 37:42.250
This.

37:43.340 --> 37:46.230
Daddy,You-- You Can't Walk Out.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.060
Daddy.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.460
What Are You Doing In Here?

38:01.610 --> 38:03.750
Because Everybody Else Has Gone Home.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.190
(Sniffles) Just Leave Me Alone.

38:06.350 --> 38:10.280
I'm Drowning My Sorrows In Gorgeous Italian Leather.

38:10.470 --> 38:12.500
Or Maybe They're Hideous.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.410
I Don't Know.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.530
I Thought I Got The Fashion Gene

38:16.670 --> 38:18.160
From My Mom,

38:18.320 --> 38:20.630
But I Was Totally Wrong.

38:20.870 --> 38:23.200
She Was All Instinct With This Stuff.

38:23.350 --> 38:26.160
It Just Came So Effortlessly.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.180
Amanda...

38:31.510 --> 38:32.790
I Worked With Your Mother.

38:32.950 --> 38:34.570
<I>Nothing</I> Came Effortlessly.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.280
But What About Her Motto?

38:36.430 --> 38:38.110
"Inspiration, Not Perspiration."

38:38.260 --> 38:41.030
Oh,Bullocks. That Woman Worked Her Arse Off.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.890
Oh,And Sweat Ke A Fishmonger.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.080
Mm,I Should Know.

38:44.230 --> 38:45.800
It Was Me That Had To Clean Off The Stains.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.920
What Am I Gonna Do Now? Work Hard?

38:49.070 --> 38:51.890
Well,Goodness Knows We Can't Have That,Can We?

38:52.030 --> 38:53.280
Listen...

38:53.440 --> 38:55.310
Just Because You Don't Have Fey Sommers' Talent,

38:55.460 --> 38:58.120
Does Not Mean That You're Not Still Her Daughter.

38:58.270 --> 39:01.900
I Mean,Look At Me. My Mother Was All Thumbs.

39:02.050 --> 39:04.350
Fortunately,My Father Liked To Design Gowns...

39:04.510 --> 39:06.060
And Wear Them.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.520
But That Doesn't Help Me.

39:14.850 --> 39:17.790
I Don't Know What My Father's Talents Are.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.220
I Don't Even Know Who He Is.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.390
Well,That's All The More Reason

39:24.560 --> 39:27.520
To Keep Looking. Hmm?

39:40.180 --> 39:41.360
<I>I Like It.</I>

39:41.510 --> 39:42.730
<I>It's Different.</I>

39:42.890 --> 39:45.860
<I>More Importantly,</I>  <I>I'd Never Have Thought Of It.</I>

39:46.020 --> 39:48.680
Well, You're No Daniel Meade.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.100
<I>So,Betty,Now That</I>  <I>You're Guilt-Free,</I>

39:54.250 --> 39:55.980
<I>You Don't Need Me</I>  <I>Anymore.</I>

39:56.130 --> 39:57.730
<I>Where Are You Gonna</I>  <I>Send Me?</I>

39:57.890 --> 40:00.480
Well,You Look Dressed For The Beach,

40:00.620 --> 40:01.720
Warm Sands.

40:01.870 --> 40:04.430
You've Worked Really Hard For A Long Time,Mr. Meade.

40:04.650 --> 40:06.380
You Deserve A Rest.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.390
<I>The Beach It Is.</I>

40:12.570 --> 40:15.070
Am I Ever Gonna See You Again?

40:18.170 --> 40:21.030
<I>I Guess</I>  <I>That's Up To You.</I>

40:30.820 --> 40:33.150
Betty,What Is That?

40:33.310 --> 40:34.920
(Gasps) My Pink Tree.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.870
Yeah. I Heard Somewhere That Pink Was The New Green.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.080
And Check It Out--

40:39.230 --> 40:41.040
White Lights For Hilda,

40:41.190 --> 40:44.040
And Tinsel For You.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.050
Hmm. It's Silver, Not Gold,

40:47.210 --> 40:49.490
But You Tried.

40:50.620 --> 40:51.560
(Whispers) Ow.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.690
<I>Mija,</I> What Are You Doing?

40:52.860 --> 40:54.350
We Can't Afford Two Trees.

40:54.530 --> 40:57.920
It's Okay. It's My Treat.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.050
I Took My Job Back.

41:00.220 --> 41:01.300
Oh.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.940
What About The Whole Tradition Thing?

41:04.510 --> 41:07.250
Well,Mom Made A Great Tree,

41:07.410 --> 41:09.850
But It's Okay To Shake It Up.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.880
We Can Do It Our Way.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.730
But We'll Always Have This To Honor Her.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.550
(Man) <I>* Feliz Navidad,</I>  <I>Prospero Ano... *</I>

41:18.710 --> 41:19.270
May I?

41:19.430 --> 41:21.680
<I>* Y Felicidad *</I>

41:23.100 --> 41:24.230
(Betty) Here,Let Me Help You.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.060
Dad,Careful.

41:26.270 --> 41:27.300
I Got It. I Got It.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.850
All Right,Then.

41:29.020 --> 41:29.960
Hey. Good Job,Dad.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.130
* I Wanna Wish You A Merry Christmas *

41:31.140 --> 41:33.260
Okay,Here Go The Lights.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.240
Ta-Da!

41:35.430 --> 41:36.280
Yay.

41:36.670 --> 41:37.940
(All) Yay.

41:36.330 --> 41:39.820
* I Wanna Wish You A Merry Christmas *

41:41.600 --> 41:44.220
Man,That Is One Ugly Tree.

41:44.830 --> 41:47.020
Well,Maybe Next Year We Can Try Something Different.

41:47.170 --> 41:47.800
Mm.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.460
* Of My Heart *
