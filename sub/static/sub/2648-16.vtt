00:05.701 --> 00:06.843
Morning.

00:07.019 --> 00:09.502
- Hey.
- Did you sleep all right?

00:09.504 --> 00:11.795
No. You?

00:12.648 --> 00:13.653
Say no, Phil.

00:13.686 --> 00:14.675
Of course no.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.234
I missed you up there.

00:16.268 --> 00:18.934
Last night, I know
I got kind of carried away...

00:18.984 --> 00:20.375
No, no, no.
You don't need to apologize.

00:20.409 --> 00:22.037
I don't think that I was apologi...

00:22.070 --> 00:23.276
You were right to be mad.

00:23.311 --> 00:27.503
Sometimes I just feel
like I have to scream

00:27.536 --> 00:29.262
to let you know how upset I am,

00:29.314 --> 00:30.722
but you get it now, right?

00:30.755 --> 00:32.800
I... do.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.175
Not.

00:34.976 --> 00:37.121
No idea whatsoever.

00:37.157 --> 00:39.939
Ohh, if I knew, but...

00:39.973 --> 00:40.819
no.

00:40.821 --> 00:42.044
Good.

00:42.078 --> 00:44.558
So let's pretend the whole thing
never happened.

00:44.593 --> 00:47.609
What were we even
fighting about, huh?

00:49.371 --> 00:51.852
What the heck happened in here?

00:51.886 --> 00:53.949
The raccoon get
through the dog door again?

00:53.949 --> 00:55.538
Yep. The raccoon got in,

00:55.539 --> 00:58.758
and your mom fought it off
with the fire extinguisher.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.233
You're a mess!

01:00.267 --> 01:01.453
Are you okay?

01:01.455 --> 01:03.699
Careful, buddy. Not today.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.275
I think you look beautiful.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.936
Save it.

01:06.969 --> 01:09.736
One time I forgot to get Gloria
a birthday present,

01:09.771 --> 01:10.648
and I paid for it.

01:10.649 --> 01:12.659
Another time I remembered,
but she didn't like the gift.

01:12.694 --> 01:14.235
I paid for that.

01:14.253 --> 01:18.709
So you'd think when I remember
to buy her a gift

01:17.705 --> 01:18.844
and she loves it,

01:18.878 --> 01:21.326
I wouldn't have
to pay for it, right?

01:47.133 --> 01:53.100

01:55.054 --> 01:56.080
Oh, hey, good.

01:56.081 --> 01:57.858
Grab the other end of this
and help me get it out of here.

01:57.892 --> 01:59.400
I have to start setting up
the chairs for tonight.

01:59.434 --> 02:00.720
Oh, tonight? What's tonight?

02:00.722 --> 02:02.620
Are you kidding me?
This is what I'm talking about, Mitchell.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.084
You never listen when I...

02:05.119 --> 02:06.174
It's a fundraiser for the friends

02:06.208 --> 02:07.515
of the Third Street
Overpass Music Society.

02:07.548 --> 02:08.939
Two harpists are performing,

02:08.990 --> 02:10.163
and you're anxious
'cause Andrew,

02:10.198 --> 02:11.539
your nemesis from
the steering committee,

02:11.573 --> 02:13.429
ran the event last year,
and you want to upstage him.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.367
I was kidding.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.709
Ha.

02:15.743 --> 02:17.167
Cam has it in his head

02:17.218 --> 02:19.510
That I don't listen to him,
but I do.

02:19.512 --> 02:22.395
Do you, Mitchell? Do you?

02:22.445 --> 02:24.742
The doctor called and said
Lily's rash is just dry skin.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.167
I'm so relieved.

02:26.202 --> 02:28.044
What did I just say?

02:28.063 --> 02:30.576
You act like you listen
to every single thing that I say,

02:30.611 --> 02:31.750
but you don't.

02:31.785 --> 02:32.957
Don't I, Mitchell?

02:33.009 --> 02:34.350
Hey, I'm going to the store today.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.026
Do you need me
to pick anything up for you?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.978
Razor blades, saline solution,
black socks,

02:42.013 --> 02:44.141
and the new issue of Vanity Fair.

02:44.159 --> 02:45.751
Wow. I don't even remember
asking for all that.

02:45.786 --> 02:47.562
Thank you.

02:47.596 --> 02:49.975
Don't I?

02:51.151 --> 02:52.743
How'd this thing come off, anyway?

02:52.793 --> 02:54.385
Well, I was cooking dinner, and...

02:54.421 --> 02:55.475
Right.

02:55.510 --> 02:57.554
And the raccoon just walked in the...

02:57.573 --> 02:59.433
And I already had the door open.

02:59.468 --> 03:01.712
Right. Which I... I had already
had ahold of the...

03:01.712 --> 03:04.506
Why don't you two go work
on your story and come back?

03:04.507 --> 03:05.014
Okay. Okay.

03:05.646 --> 03:06.953
I won't be home till late.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.915
I have another shift
at the restaurant.

03:08.949 --> 03:10.440
That's our working girl.

03:10.475 --> 03:11.613
Let the river run, honey.

03:11.648 --> 03:14.933
Check it! $57 in tips from last night.

03:14.968 --> 03:16.190
Holla!

03:16.242 --> 03:17.521
Honey, that's impressive.
You know what?

03:17.522 --> 03:20.581
$57 from you, $57 from us...

03:20.582 --> 03:21.352
You keep this up,

03:21.352 --> 03:23.523
we are going to be buying you
a car by the summer.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.148
Mom, is this "upscale casual"?

03:26.181 --> 03:27.422
What?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.528
Oh, yeah. Cam hired Luke

03:28.562 --> 03:29.902
to help out with
the benefit tonight.

03:29.936 --> 03:32.115
Hey, you know what?
I can't fix this thing.

03:32.151 --> 03:33.273
What? I need that.
I use it every day.

03:33.323 --> 03:35.001
Okay, Phil, what do you say?

03:35.034 --> 03:36.610
You want to take a trip
to the mall with me?

03:36.644 --> 03:38.504
I... do.

03:38.539 --> 03:39.526
Not,

03:39.561 --> 03:41.003
if I can possibly avoid it.

03:41.038 --> 03:44.579
Claire has this little... habit...

03:44.579 --> 03:46.876
At the mall, where sh...

03:46.911 --> 03:49.073
I can't even talk about it.

03:49.107 --> 03:50.833
Jay, come on!

03:50.885 --> 03:52.068
I want to go home

03:52.069 --> 03:53.843
because you said you were going
to film me doing the karaoke

03:53.895 --> 03:56.223
so I can send it
to Colombia to my mother.

03:56.225 --> 03:57.398
Claire, um, about the mall?

03:57.449 --> 03:58.656
I was actually gonna run out

03:58.674 --> 04:00.064
and get my hair cut
this afternoon.

04:00.099 --> 04:01.188
Well, hang on here.

04:01.239 --> 04:02.846
Why don't I run Claire
down the mall,

04:02.882 --> 04:04.357
and you give Phil a haircut?

04:04.391 --> 04:05.698
You're always talking about

04:05.716 --> 04:07.341
how you miss working at the salon.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.413
I guess I could.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.865
I do Jay. Why can't I do you?

04:10.866 --> 04:12.794
You... can do me.

04:12.796 --> 04:14.065
Okay, let's get
this party started.

04:14.116 --> 04:16.293
You know that song?

04:17.152 --> 04:18.374
Let's go, let's go!
We're wasting time!

04:18.374 --> 04:19.781
- O... okay, okay.
- Yeah.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.197
- You know it?
- I think I do.

04:23.504 --> 04:24.494
So, that was Andrew,

04:24.528 --> 04:26.171
who practically choked telling me

04:26.222 --> 04:28.981
that no one had called in
their regrets

04:28.983 --> 04:30.070
for the event tonight.

04:30.089 --> 04:31.546
It is gonna be a full house.

04:31.581 --> 04:32.938
Oh, that must feel great!

04:32.989 --> 04:35.520
- Oh, I never thought I would enjoy
having an archenemy. - Oh.

04:35.554 --> 04:38.387
- But I do, Mitchell. I do.
- Hmm.

04:38.422 --> 04:40.197
Hey, Lily, what you got there?

04:40.232 --> 04:41.874
I do feel bad for those PETA folks.

04:41.908 --> 04:43.099
Their event's tonight, too.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.597
That's why I had you mail
the invitations so long ago.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.240
I shouldn't laugh.

04:47.274 --> 04:48.228
I do feel bad

04:48.281 --> 04:49.335
for those little PETA animals.

04:49.370 --> 04:50.661
I really do.

04:50.695 --> 04:51.867
What are you doing?

04:51.903 --> 04:52.958
Nothing. She was, uh...

04:52.992 --> 04:54.348
she was, uh,
sucking her thumb again.

04:54.384 --> 04:57.067
Yes, I put Cam's invites in my car

04:57.067 --> 04:58.270
to take them to the post office

04:58.271 --> 04:59.874
and then threw my gym bag
on top of them

04:59.874 --> 05:01.834
and completely forgot they existed.

05:02.523 --> 05:05.002
Ohh, I feel terrible.

05:05.037 --> 05:07.819
Haven't been to the gym
in six weeks.

05:07.854 --> 05:10.737
And I ruined Cam's event.

05:12.203 --> 05:13.595
Hello, Miss Hartwick.

05:13.629 --> 05:15.003
Uh, Cam and I are hosting

05:15.037 --> 05:16.745
a little event tonight, and...

05:16.782 --> 05:18.120
Yes, yes.

05:18.139 --> 05:20.347
No, I am aware that
there is also a PETA event,

05:20.349 --> 05:21.991
and... ohh.

05:22.026 --> 05:23.366
Who are you talking to?

05:23.401 --> 05:25.109
I'm in the shower!

05:25.128 --> 05:26.853
Luke, how are those chairs coming?

05:26.887 --> 05:27.515
Come in.

05:27.517 --> 05:28.856
I think you should come in come in.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.868
Oh, now I'm worried
about the flow.

05:30.902 --> 05:33.668
The eyes should go to the harps,
not the backs of chairs.

05:33.702 --> 05:34.893
Are you gonna get upset

05:34.927 --> 05:37.128
and starting eating
all the appetizers again?

05:37.128 --> 05:40.094
It is amazing what you notice
and what you don't notice.

05:41.247 --> 05:43.240
Please handle that.
I need to think.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.018
Come on, Luke.

05:46.361 --> 05:48.304
Hi, there. Your father home?

05:48.340 --> 05:50.285
I think so. Why?

05:50.285 --> 05:51.126
Oh, oh! The wait staff.

05:51.126 --> 05:53.640
Please, Luke, show them
to the kitchen, please.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.396
Knock knock.

05:56.430 --> 05:57.738
Oh. Hello, Andrew.

05:57.772 --> 05:59.312
Nice chair backs.

05:59.332 --> 06:01.207
I just thought you could use this.

06:01.258 --> 06:03.806
It's the sign-in book
for my event last year.

06:03.842 --> 06:05.650
Let just turn to the blank pages,

06:05.669 --> 06:07.125
which should be...

06:07.145 --> 06:09.356
Oh. No. It's full.

06:09.407 --> 06:11.116
Oh, well, thank you
for thinking of us,

06:11.150 --> 06:12.861
but shouldn't you be getting
back home to Donald?

06:12.895 --> 06:14.856
That is the name
of your cat, isn't it?

06:14.890 --> 06:16.079
I'll see you at 7:00.

06:16.115 --> 06:17.321
Drive safely.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.921
What did I tell you?

06:22.956 --> 06:25.066
She's even worse than you said.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.151
Hold still!

06:28.187 --> 06:30.030
You can't move like that.

06:30.065 --> 06:31.422
It's like cutting the hair
of a cuckoo bird.

06:31.456 --> 06:34.155
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tense today.

06:34.188 --> 06:35.865
I knew it. Something happened.

06:35.882 --> 06:38.279
Because when somebody
works in a salon,

06:38.313 --> 06:40.559
they know when someone
needs to talk.

06:40.593 --> 06:42.722
Actually, you might be able
to help me with this one.

06:42.758 --> 06:44.348
Claire and I got into
a huge fight last night...

06:44.383 --> 06:46.157
And I'm not even sure
what it was about.

06:46.159 --> 06:49.416
- Was that why you didn't want
to go to the mall with her? - Oh.

06:49.416 --> 06:51.896
No, that was...
more about a weird...

06:51.931 --> 06:54.614
mall habit Claire has.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.888
Oh, my god! That's good!

06:55.921 --> 06:57.162
Oh, oh! Go low, go low.

06:57.197 --> 06:59.442
Go low, go low. Oh! Oh!

06:59.475 --> 07:00.415
Oh, my god!

07:00.449 --> 07:01.471
Dad! Dad!

07:01.505 --> 07:03.600
You got to get one of these! Oh!

07:03.635 --> 07:07.020
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

07:07.491 --> 07:09.402
It is impressive how much
Haley's earning.

07:09.436 --> 07:12.330
She's over $500 already.
That's a lot of cheddar.

07:12.330 --> 07:13.437
Why's everyone acting

07:13.471 --> 07:15.381
like she's the first 17-year-old
to have a job?

07:15.416 --> 07:16.903
In other cultures,
she'd have two kids already,

07:16.904 --> 07:17.646
and they'd have jobs.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.656
You know, I stopped
by the restaurant a couple times,

07:19.691 --> 07:20.629
and she wasn't there.

07:20.788 --> 07:21.993
When?

07:22.011 --> 07:24.810
Uh, I don't remember.
I was at the mall for a movie.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.422
Think! I need details!

07:26.422 --> 07:27.881
Okay, it was a romantic comedy

07:27.915 --> 07:29.742
my now ex-friend
Reuben recommended...

07:29.775 --> 07:31.647
Not about the movie!
What day?! Focus!

07:31.649 --> 07:33.308
Okay, uh, it was Tuesday,

07:33.341 --> 07:35.402
but I also ate there
again on Saturday,

07:35.436 --> 07:36.839
and she wasn't there then, either.

07:38.617 --> 07:39.656
Oh, my god.

07:39.708 --> 07:40.913
I bet she doesn't even work there.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.891
Well, then, where's
all this money coming from?

07:42.927 --> 07:44.568
Do you notice how
every single night

07:44.602 --> 07:46.363
is just under $60?

07:46.414 --> 07:48.646
Grandpa gave her
$60 for her birthday.

07:48.646 --> 07:50.445
She's just hanging around
the mall all day,

07:50.446 --> 07:52.248
flashing the same cash
every night,

07:52.250 --> 07:53.988
and fooling my parents
into buying her a car.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.766
Hey, dad!

07:55.768 --> 07:57.643
Can we eat at Haley's
restaurant tonight?!

07:57.712 --> 07:59.237
Hey, there's a good idea!

07:59.271 --> 08:00.631
Great. I'll text her.

08:02.305 --> 08:04.635
Oh, god, no!

08:04.670 --> 08:06.999
Oh, god, yes!

08:07.034 --> 08:08.910
Oh! Oh, god, yes!

08:08.946 --> 08:11.336
Oh, get after it!

08:11.336 --> 08:12.107
Ohh!

08:12.109 --> 08:14.052
Amazing.

08:14.069 --> 08:15.191
I'm going for 15 more on me.

08:15.225 --> 08:16.532
I think you got
what you needed from that.

08:16.551 --> 08:18.729
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.055
You know, maybe you do need
to talk about this fight.

08:23.089 --> 08:24.698
With Phil?

08:24.732 --> 08:26.895
How could you not know
what she was mad about?

08:26.930 --> 08:29.375
Because she didn't tell me.
She just freaked out.

08:29.428 --> 08:31.689
I cannot believe you, Phil!

08:31.709 --> 08:33.460
How could you?!

08:33.462 --> 08:35.792
What is happening?
What... what did I do?

08:35.825 --> 08:36.797
Are you serious?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.188
You are! You don't know.

08:38.222 --> 08:39.831
We've had this conversation
a hundred times.

08:39.865 --> 08:40.938
You know... no, no.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.397
I'm not...
I'm not doing this again.

08:42.448 --> 08:44.359
You tell me what you did.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.465
Uh...

08:45.484 --> 08:46.725
"Uh..."

08:46.726 --> 08:48.234
- Was it...
- "Was it..."

08:48.268 --> 08:49.721
- Uh...
- "Uh"?

08:49.722 --> 08:50.962
No, Phil.

08:50.980 --> 08:52.572
No. No, no, no. No!

08:52.607 --> 08:53.964
- I'm going to get some air.
- Claire.

08:53.998 --> 08:55.423
- Claire!
- No! Don't follow me.

08:55.441 --> 08:58.844
Happy valen-birth-iversary!

08:58.862 --> 09:00.201
Storming off...

09:00.252 --> 09:01.643
right out of your mom's playbook.

09:01.677 --> 09:02.766
Mm.

09:02.785 --> 09:04.260
Where'd you go?

09:04.294 --> 09:07.076
Well, as it turns out,
not very far.

09:10.682 --> 09:12.273
Oh.

09:12.358 --> 09:13.832
Damn it.

09:50.427 --> 09:51.448
Phil!

09:51.482 --> 09:53.409
Phil, you moron, stop it!

09:53.690 --> 09:55.545
- It's me, you idiot!
- I'm sorry!

09:55.545 --> 09:56.501
What are you doing?!

09:56.535 --> 09:57.489
I'm sorry!

09:57.525 --> 09:58.898
I thought you were a raccoon!

09:58.950 --> 10:00.323
You thought I was a raccoon!

10:00.357 --> 10:02.135
Because people look
so much like raccoons.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.223
Oh, look.

10:03.276 --> 10:04.615
There's one now!

10:04.649 --> 10:06.729
No, Claire, no! Claire!

10:08.606 --> 10:10.434
Wait a minute.

10:10.468 --> 10:13.234
Not even crazy woman
go crazy for no reason.

10:13.267 --> 10:15.176
What happened
before the broccoli?

10:15.176 --> 10:16.418
That's just it...
it came out of the blue.

10:16.418 --> 10:17.456
I walked in the door,

10:17.490 --> 10:19.016
we're having a conversation
about nothing.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.310
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

10:20.311 --> 10:21.613
Sorry I got stuck at the office.

10:21.615 --> 10:22.585
How was your day?

10:22.620 --> 10:23.625
It was good.

10:23.659 --> 10:24.966
- Although you know what?
- What?

10:24.984 --> 10:27.091
Debbie stood me up for lunch.

10:27.092 --> 10:28.081
Rude, right?

10:28.115 --> 10:29.255
No. She called.

10:29.305 --> 10:30.580
I didn't get a message.

10:30.614 --> 10:31.652
Yeah. You did.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.430
I left you one.

10:33.464 --> 10:36.480
It's right... there.

10:36.516 --> 10:38.090
Uh-huh.

10:38.759 --> 10:40.736
That's it!

10:40.787 --> 10:43.419
How is she supposed
to see this?

10:43.453 --> 10:46.487
If you give me a message
this tiny, I kill you.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.207
But that's not when she got mad.

10:48.209 --> 10:50.897
Also, I talked to the insurance company

10:50.898 --> 10:53.921
about that little accident
that "wasn't your fault"

10:53.922 --> 10:56.354
because the brakes
weren't "working right."

10:57.811 --> 11:00.137
And that's not gonna cost us
as much money as I thought,

11:00.139 --> 11:01.110
so that's good.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.082
That's it!

11:02.099 --> 11:04.045
You insult a woman's driving,

11:04.047 --> 11:05.972
and you use the "Air bunnies."

11:06.006 --> 11:07.615
You do that to me, and I kill you.

11:08.354 --> 11:09.493
I hear you,

11:09.528 --> 11:13.047
but the screaming
still hadn't started yet.

11:13.081 --> 11:14.994
So, I'm having lunch with
Skip Woosnum, right?

11:14.995 --> 11:16.652
Boy, can that guy go on and on.

11:16.688 --> 11:18.812
Tangent after tangent.

11:18.906 --> 11:20.951
By the way, turned me
on to the greatest thing...

11:20.986 --> 11:22.460
wedge salad... you go to try it.

11:22.495 --> 11:23.836
Anyhoo...

11:23.869 --> 11:26.450
Guess who's sitting
at the table next to us.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.430
My old girlfriend Carla.

11:28.464 --> 11:29.518
Yeah!

11:29.553 --> 11:30.743
We're gonna grab coffee.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.253
She lost a ton of weight.

11:32.286 --> 11:34.465
How stupid are you?

11:34.517 --> 11:37.114
You tell me that you're seeing
an old girlfriend, and I...

11:37.182 --> 11:38.355
Kill me, I know.

11:38.423 --> 11:40.719
But she still hadn't snapped yet.

11:40.753 --> 11:41.844
I almost forgot.

11:41.877 --> 11:43.955
I picked up the broccoli
you asked for.

11:45.196 --> 11:46.738
Cauliflower.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.771
Can't believe I did that again.

11:48.772 --> 11:51.368
I cannot believe you, Phil!

11:51.386 --> 11:53.164
You didn't do one thing wrong.

11:53.198 --> 11:54.890
You do everything wrong!

11:54.924 --> 11:57.590
I don't even know
why she talks to you.

11:57.624 --> 11:59.568
She said she was okay.

11:59.603 --> 12:02.050
No. No woman is okay with this.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.358
We don't forget.

12:03.408 --> 12:04.514
We wait.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.777
And then, when you least expect it,

12:06.828 --> 12:08.741
We make you pay.

12:08.742 --> 12:09.730
Chin up!

12:09.765 --> 12:11.172
Ohh.

12:11.206 --> 12:13.082
Up!

12:13.118 --> 12:14.659
So you had a meltdown over that.

12:14.694 --> 12:16.955
I did, because ever
since I met him,

12:16.990 --> 12:19.941
I've been trying to get Phil
to try a wedge salad.

12:19.975 --> 12:21.885
The minute that Skip Woosnum,

12:21.919 --> 12:24.149
whom he doesn't even like,
suggests it,

12:24.183 --> 12:25.912
Phil thinks it's
the greatest thing ever,

12:25.913 --> 12:27.654
and he does this with everything.

12:27.688 --> 12:29.934
He does it with books,
with movies, with TV.

12:29.968 --> 12:32.986
He listens to everybody's
opinion but mine,

12:32.987 --> 12:34.629
and it drives me crazy.

12:34.664 --> 12:36.154
You two seemed fine this morning.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.747
Well, we were because
we talked about it,

12:37.781 --> 12:38.907
which, by the way,

12:38.907 --> 12:41.278
if you want this whole karaoke thing
with Gloria to go away,

12:41.279 --> 12:42.468
that's what you need to do.

12:42.502 --> 12:43.962
That's easier said than done.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.768
Well, since when do you
shy away from confrontation,

12:47.802 --> 12:50.652
Mr. Tough Talk,
Mr. Straight Shooter?

12:50.704 --> 12:52.596
Getting a little soft, grandpa?

12:52.630 --> 12:54.726
You know, when you get a massage,

12:54.744 --> 12:56.973
you sound like
a Tijuana prostitute.

13:02.021 --> 13:03.747
Luke, phone.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.899
Friends of the Third Street...

13:09.934 --> 13:11.627
Is that Mitchell?
What's taking him?

13:11.661 --> 13:13.863
No, it's not Mitchell. It's...

13:13.864 --> 13:15.924
I don't understand his name.

13:15.975 --> 13:17.383
Hello?

13:17.419 --> 13:19.664
Oh, hi, Longinus.
Listen, did you get my message?

13:19.698 --> 13:20.609
About the chiavari chairs...

13:20.609 --> 13:22.856
I want you to bring them
when you come.

13:22.890 --> 13:25.401
What do you mean
you're not... not coming?

13:25.948 --> 13:27.372
Well, that's not possible.

13:27.422 --> 13:29.568
Mitch... Mitch mailed them
weeks ago.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.699
What about Pepper?
Did he get his?

13:31.732 --> 13:32.931
And L'Michael?

13:32.932 --> 13:34.984
And Steven and Stefan?

13:34.985 --> 13:36.443
And Bob?

13:36.478 --> 13:38.052
I have to go.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.802
Get me your uncle Mitchell.

13:40.836 --> 13:42.396
I don't know his number.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.732
It went to voicemail.

13:48.734 --> 13:49.402
Of course it did.

13:49.402 --> 13:51.330
Keep trying him
until you get him.

13:52.369 --> 13:53.994
It's one button.

13:54.012 --> 13:55.537
Just... redial.

13:57.022 --> 13:58.123
Hey, really great event tonight

13:58.124 --> 14:01.077
benefiting the music society...
musicians like you.

14:01.112 --> 14:02.939
Okay.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.136
Hey!

14:08.171 --> 14:10.144
Uncle Cam for uncle Mitchell.

14:10.144 --> 14:10.680
How could you, Mitchell?!

14:10.681 --> 14:12.304
Honestly! Give me that.

14:12.338 --> 14:13.705
You want to hear
the guest list for night?

14:13.706 --> 14:17.249
So far it's anger, betrayal,
terror, and sadness.

14:17.251 --> 14:19.278
Congratulations, Mitchell,
you packed the house!

14:19.314 --> 14:20.837
Cam, I am so sorry.

14:20.872 --> 14:22.968
I... I... I'm gonna fix it.
I'll make a big donation.

14:23.019 --> 14:24.359
That's not gonna keep them

14:24.393 --> 14:26.337
from kicking me
off the steering committee!

14:26.371 --> 14:27.930
When Andrew walks in here

14:27.998 --> 14:30.545
and sees a room
full of empty chairs...

14:30.580 --> 14:32.222
You know he's not really
your archenemy.

14:32.256 --> 14:33.647
that's sort of a made-up thing.

14:33.681 --> 14:35.191
Fix it!

14:39.281 --> 14:41.730
- Hi! You came!
- Hi!

14:41.764 --> 14:43.725
- Of course we did. We wanted
to see you work. - Oh.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.384
We're so proud
of you, sweetheart.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.930
Yeah, we're all proud.
So where's our table?

14:47.932 --> 14:50.060
Actually, bad news.

14:50.094 --> 14:50.929
We're totally booked.

14:50.930 --> 14:53.209
We have a ton of reservations.

14:53.228 --> 14:55.978
Yeah, one's ours. I called.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.688
Here it is!

14:57.722 --> 14:59.699
Hey.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.712
Uh, so, your table is right here.

15:01.746 --> 15:04.411
Oh, honey, would you mind
getting us a couple drinks?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.021
I would love an iced tea.

15:06.055 --> 15:07.446
Same, please.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.855
I'll have a mango-kiwi smoothie,

15:08.889 --> 15:10.866
yogurt instead of ice cream,
and make it low-fat.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.624
I want to look good when
I'm riding in your new car.

15:13.624 --> 15:15.787
Honey, I got to say,

15:15.804 --> 15:17.161
I like this haircut.

15:17.196 --> 15:18.973
Hey, we're all just playing
for second in this family.

15:19.007 --> 15:19.962
Hmm.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.399
Were you all done here?

15:23.433 --> 15:24.741
Uh, actually, no.

15:24.775 --> 15:27.406
Um, I will have more iced tea,

15:27.441 --> 15:28.764
another iced tea,

15:28.800 --> 15:30.608
and a mango-kiwi smoothie,

15:30.643 --> 15:32.051
all ice cream.

15:33.008 --> 15:34.231
I'm pregnant.

15:36.076 --> 15:37.551
Well, this is nice.

15:37.585 --> 15:41.676
Me, my gals, and my beautiful,
beautiful wife.

15:41.677 --> 15:44.089
Just so you know,
I rescheduled with Carla.

15:44.123 --> 15:45.900
I penciled her in for the 12th...

15:45.934 --> 15:46.939
of never.

15:46.974 --> 15:48.432
That's too bad.

15:48.466 --> 15:50.713
I was kind of looking forward
to hearing about that one.

15:50.714 --> 15:52.922
Oh.

15:52.924 --> 15:54.247
By the way,

15:54.282 --> 15:55.873
no one called for you
while you were out.

15:55.925 --> 15:57.163
Thank you?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.907
I just want to make sure
you get any messages

15:58.941 --> 16:01.019
from any friends who might call,
which none of them did.

16:01.816 --> 16:04.299
Isn't it weird that Haley's
the only one here

16:04.333 --> 16:05.673
not wearing a name tag?

16:05.707 --> 16:08.054
If your mother had a name tag,
it would say "good driver."

16:08.088 --> 16:09.462
- Phil...
- Here you go.

16:09.498 --> 16:12.011
I want to hear the specials.

16:12.045 --> 16:13.957
- Uh, we're out of specials.
- What were they?

16:13.991 --> 16:17.476
Popular, which you
wouldn't understand.

16:17.511 --> 16:18.998
Well, what could be better

16:18.998 --> 16:20.059
than drinks with a beautiful woman?

16:20.093 --> 16:23.413
And every beautiful woman
deserves flowers.

16:23.447 --> 16:25.424
Cauliflowers.

16:25.458 --> 16:28.073
Okay. What's going on?
Is this about last night?

16:28.107 --> 16:30.638
Yeah, I just want you to know
how important to me you are.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.285
Sweetie, I know that.
I know that.

16:32.286 --> 16:34.918
I still feel bad about, you know

16:34.953 --> 16:37.785
what I... did.

16:37.787 --> 16:39.093
Listen to me.

16:39.127 --> 16:40.720
You and I are fine.

16:40.754 --> 16:42.027
Okay?

16:42.061 --> 16:43.504
I'm just really hungry.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.364
Okay?

16:45.415 --> 16:46.538
Okay.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.215
Okay.

16:48.265 --> 16:50.076
All right!

16:50.110 --> 16:51.887
What looks good?

16:51.921 --> 16:53.144
Oh, gosh.

16:53.177 --> 16:54.786
Oh, here's something
that jumps right off the page.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.044
- Uh-huh.
- I tried this yesterday,

16:56.080 --> 16:58.032
thanks to my good
friend Skip Woosnum.

16:58.033 --> 17:00.663
Claire, do yourself a favor

17:00.699 --> 17:04.386
and join me wedge salad.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.866
You have got to be kidding me!

17:06.902 --> 17:09.073
Just try it. You will thank me.

17:09.074 --> 17:11.204
Did you learn nothing
from last night?

17:11.205 --> 17:12.413
Whoa.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.519
It was about the salad?

17:13.554 --> 17:15.380
I have been recommending
wedge salads to you,

17:15.415 --> 17:17.476
Amongst other things, for years,

17:17.511 --> 17:18.983
and you never listen to me.

17:19.003 --> 17:20.595
And then some idiot suggests it,

17:20.628 --> 17:22.573
and you can't wait
to try a wedge salad?!

17:22.608 --> 17:26.095
It makes me feel
like I don't matter.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.604
Thanks a lot, dad!

17:30.656 --> 17:33.203
Mom's little outburst
just got me fired!

17:33.238 --> 17:35.047
Okay, I got to talk to your mom.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.388
You comfort your sister.

17:36.408 --> 17:39.643
She never worked here!

17:45.404 --> 17:46.576
So, Mitchell called you, too.

17:46.611 --> 17:47.598
Mm-hmm.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.390
I take it you haven't
had your conversation

17:54.408 --> 17:55.396
with Gloria yet?

17:55.431 --> 17:56.352
It's getting worse.

17:56.386 --> 17:57.525
She sang all the way here.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.817
We passed two cars...

17:58.851 --> 18:00.292
the dogs stuck their heads
back inside the window.

18:00.309 --> 18:01.901
Wow.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.506
What are we gonna do?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.836
- I could start a fire.
- No.

18:07.872 --> 18:10.285
Keep that in your back pocket.

18:10.318 --> 18:11.660
Hey.

18:11.678 --> 18:12.884
Hey.

18:12.936 --> 18:14.661
I want to show you something.

18:14.695 --> 18:15.970
Let me guess.

18:16.003 --> 18:18.082
It's a copy of "The book thief"
that I begged you to read,

18:18.115 --> 18:19.858
but you wouldn't until
your dental hygienist

18:19.893 --> 18:21.065
said it changed her life.

18:22.577 --> 18:25.231
- Remember this?
- Uh-huh.

18:25.232 --> 18:27.445
It's the first Thanksgiving
I spent with your family.

18:27.479 --> 18:29.591
God, I hated that ponytail.

18:29.625 --> 18:30.161
I know.

18:30.162 --> 18:31.889
You said it made me look
like a wimpy bouncer,

18:31.890 --> 18:32.995
- so I cut it off.
- Mm.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.304
Just like I lost
the feathered earring...

18:35.305 --> 18:37.616
and the van
with the beanbag chairs.

18:37.652 --> 18:39.813
And I changed my forestry major.

18:39.866 --> 18:42.046
I get it, Phil. I get it.

18:42.047 --> 18:43.270
I am the controlling witch

18:43.271 --> 18:44.728
- that made you give up everything fun
in your l... - No. No.

18:44.763 --> 18:45.850
You're the witch who saved me.

18:45.887 --> 18:48.382
Look. Look at this picture.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.312
Now look at this guy.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.642
You can't tell me
our opinion doesn't matter.

18:52.675 --> 18:55.577
You changed me for the better
in a hundred different ways.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.761
Yeah, I... I might miss
a book or a salad

18:58.797 --> 19:00.589
here and there, but...

19:00.624 --> 19:03.155
I've got Claire all over me.

19:03.189 --> 19:05.534
You're about to.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.700
That's the worst
sound in the world.

19:11.735 --> 19:12.975
Is it?

19:13.010 --> 19:15.858
Friends, uh, family,
uh, board members...

19:15.893 --> 19:17.132
"Bored" is right.

19:18.274 --> 19:19.865
I know we were all
looking forward

19:19.901 --> 19:23.304
to hearing the beautiful
stylings of Harp Attack,

19:23.337 --> 19:25.997
but there has, unfortunately,
been a slight...

19:25.998 --> 19:27.322
Don't start yet!

19:27.355 --> 19:28.630
delay,

19:28.648 --> 19:31.143
and the program will start
in a few minutes, on time.

19:31.179 --> 19:32.786
Uh, so, please,
everyone take their seats.

19:32.821 --> 19:34.196
Thank you.

19:34.230 --> 19:36.441
Oh, my god, you did it!

19:36.460 --> 19:37.213
Sort of.

19:37.214 --> 19:38.973
I know this isn't
what you were hoping for,

19:39.008 --> 19:42.126
but I need to do a better job
of listening to you.

19:42.127 --> 19:43.034
No, no, you did the best you could,

19:43.035 --> 19:44.961
and, plus, this is double
what Andrew had last year

19:45.029 --> 19:46.016
for "Cello submarine."

19:46.052 --> 19:47.577
- Thank you.
- Oh.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.051
Oh... how are you
sitting at a harp

19:49.086 --> 19:51.085
and not scoring this moment?
Ladies!

20:00.036 --> 20:02.347
You can't have
a successful marriage

20:02.416 --> 20:04.159
without being a good listener.

20:04.193 --> 20:06.204
Sometimes it takes a little work...

20:06.222 --> 20:07.209
I just wonder
what they're gonna do

20:07.210 --> 20:08.012
with their lives, you know?

20:08.013 --> 20:09.520
I just wonder how they can
actually, you know,

20:09.555 --> 20:11.950
ever find their true calling
with a harp.

20:11.951 --> 20:14.298
Sometimes it takes a lot of work...

20:15.607 --> 20:17.164
Harps!

20:19.061 --> 20:21.675
And sometimes
it's just excruciating.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.867
Jay, come. I work out
another song.

20:25.886 --> 20:27.040
Gloria.

20:29.608 --> 20:30.355
Gloria.

20:30.445 --> 20:31.635
No!

20:31.669 --> 20:33.243
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:33.261 --> 20:34.585
I can't take it anymore!

20:34.621 --> 20:36.783
Okay? It's not singing,
it's screaming.

20:36.816 --> 20:38.996
Mom, I love you,
but for the love of god,

20:39.047 --> 20:41.645
destroy that thing
before it destroys this family!

20:41.678 --> 20:42.852
Coward!

20:44.479 --> 20:47.932
I think you sound great,
but if it bothers the kid...

20:47.968 --> 20:49.056
Coward!

21:23.036 --> 21:24.427
You keep this up,

21:24.460 --> 21:26.523
and this won't be
the last plug I pull.
