00:03.503 --> 00:05.504
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.106
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.107 --> 00:10.565
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.914 --> 00:49.848
Mr. Tippin?

00:49.849 --> 00:52.349
I'm Kate Jones.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.120
Danny and I were having
an affair.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.522
I knew that
he had been seeing someone,

00:56.523 --> 00:59.617
but I wasn't really thinking
so much about her.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.360
Here's what doesn't
make any sense.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.228
I did a trace on
your Social Security number.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.729
Kate Jones...

01:05.799 --> 01:08.791
you died in 1973.

01:09.702 --> 01:10.969
I have to go.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.470
Who the hell are you?

01:14.174 --> 01:16.674
Oh, no.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.578
That leak.
The glitch.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.513
There's a worm.
There's a hacker in our network.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.515
They're downloading
all the files off the server!

01:23.516 --> 01:26.016
Got to cut the hard line.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.687
Hello, Alain?
We need to meet.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.459
I think we have a mole.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.960
Parkishoff was assassinated
by Martin Shepard.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.697
Shepard checked himself
into a mental institution

01:38.698 --> 01:40.065
in southern Romania.

01:40.066 --> 01:41.867
We want you to get close
to Shepard

01:41.868 --> 01:44.962
and get him to tell you
where Parkishoff is buried.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.909
Agent Fisher will be
your support on this one.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.606
His alias is
Dr. Carlos Fontanetta.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.180
Fisher?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.603 --> 02:19.103
Hey!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.875
Jack, I thought
you should know

03:29.876 --> 03:32.811
Sydney and Fisher missed
their scheduled contact.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.379
What are you thinking?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.510
Worst case is,
they're not alone in there.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.577
Maybe someone posing
as a patient or a doctor.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.987
Come on, Jack.
Sydney's a smart kid.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.559
We've seen her through
worse than this.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.264
Maybe not.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.099
Maybe not.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.600
But I believe in her.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.898
I believe in her as if
she were my own daughter.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.375
That's nice to hear.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.781
When's her next
scheduled contact?

04:09.782 --> 04:11.850
10 hours.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.513
Then we'll know
how hot the water is.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.360
Let us not waste time.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.886
I know that you work for SD-6.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.266
I know that you are here
to find out

04:27.267 --> 04:30.236
where Martin Shepard
buried Parkishoff,

04:30.303 --> 04:35.400
that you need Parkishoff's DNA
to read FTL code.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.074
What I do not know
is whether you have succeeded.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.381
Since we're not playing games...

04:44.484 --> 04:46.885
...which is refreshing...

04:46.886 --> 04:48.787
I'd like to know who's asking.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.288
My affiliation is unimportant.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.254
You have until
the machine charges.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.829
Answer my question.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.060
Wait. This can't be the best
version of this conversation.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.936
Look, Shepard didn't talk.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.272
I don't know
where Parkishoff is buried.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.868
Wait. Wait! I'm telling you!
I don't know anything! Wait!

05:21.254 --> 05:23.754
Ah, Mr. Bristow.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.191
Your usual table
is waiting for you, sir.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.692
Thank you, Joey.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.166
Mr. Bristow,
I'm sorry about the...

05:37.403 --> 05:38.403
Who are you?

05:38.404 --> 05:41.134
I'm CIA.
Operations Officer Vaughn.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.507
I'm Sydney's handler.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.376
I cleared this meet with Devlin.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.178
Cretchmer walked me through
your S.O.P.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.679
We're safe.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.783
Are Sydney and I
switching handlers,

05:51.784 --> 05:53.685
or is this a special occasion?

05:53.686 --> 05:55.120
No.
We have a problem.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.888
Fisher hasn't made contact.
I know.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.257
We believe K-Directorate
had an agent waiting

05:59.258 --> 06:01.758
in the hospital.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.224
SD-6 does not have
confirmation of that.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.898
The CIA does.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.567
We have an extraction team

06:08.568 --> 06:10.602
waiting on the ready line
out of Serbia.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.103
I want to pull Sydney
out of there.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.479
I was hoping that we could
coordinate this together.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.081
Mr. Vaughn, you're young.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.517
And you're eager,
and I understand that.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.119
One thing you're not,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.647
and this is something only
time can provide, really,

06:30.723 --> 06:33.223
is wise.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.293
You don't think
this is the right move.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.229
Listen carefully, Mr. Vaughn.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.297
Even with a minimal
extraction team,

06:39.298 --> 06:42.028
you can't guarantee containment.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.601
If Sloane finds out,
Sydney's as good as dead.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.638
Retire her early.
Pull her out of service.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.707
In the process,
expose your operation at SD-6.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.142
Sydney's life is worth the risk.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.643
Not to Sydney!

06:52.812 --> 06:56.646
Taking them down is what
gets her up in the morning.

06:58.284 --> 07:01.276
Or did you think it was
those meetings she has with you?

07:01.354 --> 07:03.455
Hey, what is your problem
with me?

07:03.456 --> 07:05.524
You pulled my file last week.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.517
That's my problem, Mr. Vaughn.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.529
Did curiosity
get the better of you,

07:10.530 --> 07:13.693
or were you trying to impress
my daughter?

07:18.070 --> 07:20.570
She thinks you were KGB.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.141
But I'm sure
you already knew that.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.243
What I'm wondering is,
what were you doing

07:25.244 --> 07:28.042
checking up on me
checking up on you?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.717
This meeting is over.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.739
You can't torture Shepard
for information.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.978
Electroshock won't work.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.172
FTL trained him to forget
everything he did.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.621
That's why you're here
posing as a shrink.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.250
You're K-Directorate,
aren't you?

08:20.199 --> 08:23.464
What makes you think
I work with K-Directorate?

08:23.569 --> 08:25.704
Your accent's Georgian.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.539
Georgia, former Soviet Union.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.040
Their main recruiting ground.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.111
Shepard thinks I'm a patient.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.013
He's more likely
to trust me than you.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.048
Except he has already
attacked you.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.549
Which I could use to seal
his transference

08:39.585 --> 08:41.385
by bringing his guilt
to the surface

08:41.386 --> 08:43.054
and then forgiving him.

08:43.054 --> 08:47.116
I suppose you'd like
your life in return.

08:47.193 --> 08:52.256
If you'll get Shepard to recall
the location of Parkishoff,

08:52.331 --> 08:54.666
you might just live out
your life

08:54.667 --> 08:58.159
in a Chechnyan internment camp.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.172
You have until lockdown tonight.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.616
Stay away from me.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.486
I'm here to help you.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.291
I don't want your help.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.023
I'm not open to your help.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.431
I think I know
what's happening to you.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.924
I'm sure you do,
because you're one of them.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.460
You know the words that
are going on in my head.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.232
I know I've seen you
somewhere before.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.944
No, you haven't.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.540
I thought I was safe here.
I thought I was safe here.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.251
What I'm about to say
to you is the truth,

10:20.252 --> 10:22.812
so you got to listen to me.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.424
They are gonna kill us both
if we don't help each other

10:33.499 --> 10:36.332
to get out of here.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.902
Then you've got
a real problem...

10:40.339 --> 10:43.103
...because I'm not leaving here.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.675
I would rather die...

10:46.779 --> 10:50.112
...than leave the way I am now.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.234
Do you have the chart
Dr. Kreshnik asked for?

12:44.463 --> 12:46.598
Yellow sky.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.166
Interesting choice.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.968
I told you,
you stay away from me.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.563
I know that you're starting
to remember some things.

12:52.671 --> 12:55.401
I know you think that I had
something to do with them,

12:55.508 --> 12:56.641
but I didn't.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.877
Piss off.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.378
You can't see colors, can you?

13:03.048 --> 13:04.749
Who are you?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.417
If you're not one of the people
that did this to me,

13:06.418 --> 13:08.918
then how do you know that?

13:09.221 --> 13:11.356
I'll tell you
what you need to know,

13:11.357 --> 13:14.087
but first you have to help me.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.494
I was sent here to get
some information from you,

13:16.495 --> 13:18.163
but I don't even care
about that anymore.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.258
All I care about
is that the main exit door

13:21.333 --> 13:22.700
has a dual-key lock.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.202
That means it takes two people

13:24.203 --> 13:26.638
using two keys at the same time
to open the door.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.206
I told you,
I'm not leaving here.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.707
No, please believe me.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.472
There are people who want to
find out what's in your head.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.813
When they don't,
they will kill us both.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.749
You want me to believe you,
but you don't tell me anything.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.980
I know I've seen you somewhere.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.581
Okay, okay.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.157
Look...

13:47.159 --> 13:48.393
...you were trained.

13:48.394 --> 13:52.330
You were programmed
to follow orders.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.499
Whose orders?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.701
Whose orders?

13:56.702 --> 13:59.202
To do what? To do...

14:00.239 --> 14:02.739
To kill.

14:04.877 --> 14:05.977
No. No.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.413
The things you're remembering.
They're real.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.148
I know it's hard to hear.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.749
Accept that you did
these things.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.984
I'd rather be crazy.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.715
When you're following orders,

14:15.788 --> 14:18.056
you're trained to see
everything in black and white

14:18.057 --> 14:21.026
to keep you detached
from what you have to do.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.891
You're not supposed to remember
anything, but you are.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.997
Your training must be
short-circuiting.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.331
What you did,
it's so painful to remember

14:29.401 --> 14:31.569
that you're seeing in black
and white all the time.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.204
It's a defense mechanism,
but it's good.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.799
You're starting to heal,
to get better and better.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.309
Stop it, please!

14:38.310 --> 14:40.810
Guard!

14:41.080 --> 14:42.714
Take me to my room.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.215
Take him.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.753
Lockdown.

14:52.291 --> 14:58.127
Tell Dr. Kreshnik I have
the information he needs.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.869
A memo from legal
about reporters

15:04.870 --> 15:06.437
quoting other reporters.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.106
What's it say?

15:08.107 --> 15:10.632
"Cut it out."

15:10.743 --> 15:11.809
Happy Thanksgiving.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.310
Thanks, Jenny.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.452
Davis, can you
scroll back down for a second?

15:21.453 --> 15:22.987
Did you get the memo?

15:22.988 --> 15:25.056
Can you just show me
the damn picture?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.557
All right. Jeez.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.962
Her name was Eloise Kurtz.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.057
Local girl. Found shot to death
in Echo Park.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.633
Did you know her?

15:37.202 --> 15:38.670
She said her name
was Kate Jones,

15:38.671 --> 15:40.038
but it was really
Eloise Kurtz.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.539
She was my source in
the Danny Hecht investigation.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.372
She was involved somehow, she
was trying to tell me something,

15:45.444 --> 15:46.577
and now she's dead.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.613
I am not saying
there is nothing here.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.614
You wouldn't publish this

15:49.615 --> 15:52.948
even though I was investigating
one murder and now two?

15:53.018 --> 15:55.086
The fastest way
to be discredited

15:55.087 --> 15:58.352
is to author a conspiracy theory
without background.

15:58.424 --> 15:59.691
Believe me, I have seen this.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.392
You might as well publish
your own home page.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.918
Will you at least
take a look at my notes?

16:03.996 --> 16:06.230
Leave them on my desk
when you go.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.299
I'm not telling you
to drop this.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.734
I'm not being a monster.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.569
I'm telling you
to bring it back to me

16:11.570 --> 16:14.070
when it's more developed.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.776
Oh, my God.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.575
We are coming to you now,
Doctor.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.247
What is that tattoo on your arm?

16:56.248 --> 16:58.216
Spitznas special forces?

16:58.217 --> 17:00.218
I almost got a tattoo once.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.719
I was on the guy's chair...

18:32.578 --> 18:35.078
Aah!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.614
Take her.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.089
Hurts, doesn't it?

19:21.927 --> 19:22.994
You were right.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.695
I don't want to die in here.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.164
How did you get out
of your room?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.299
Oh, I was quite good, actually.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.133
I pretended
to swallow my tongue,

19:31.236 --> 19:33.898
and lifted the keys.

19:49.721 --> 19:50.721
Hey.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.222
Look at me.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.659
You can do this.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.696
You think I'd help you get out
if I thought you'd kill someone?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.304
Unless you're planning
on killing me.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.375
Why would I do that?

20:38.103 --> 20:39.870
Sorry.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.371
Get in!

20:44.977 --> 20:47.477
Seat belt.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.023
<i># I said the wait child,
bruised-ball child #</i>

20:59.024 --> 21:00.124
<i># Pride-slapped child hurts #</i>

21:00.125 --> 21:01.692
Whoa. Hey. Company.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.890
Uh, here,
totally a mess in here.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.631
I'm sorry, let me just...

21:06.632 --> 21:09.601
I wasn't really
expecting anyone.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.669
You want to have a seat?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.871
I got a minor form of scoliosis,

21:13.872 --> 21:16.107
so the air
ergonomically hugs me.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.608
Oh, you want to stretch out?

21:18.644 --> 21:20.778
I can inflate the couch.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.013
I'll stand.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.147
Oh, by the way,

21:23.148 --> 21:25.946
I scanned every byte
of that computer network.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.918
No more virus.
That leak is plugged.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.187
Even better news,
since it was exporting files

21:30.188 --> 21:32.056
at such a low bandwidth.
Only 3%.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.151
The virus was
a Security Section drill.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.526
Um... a drill?

21:38.597 --> 21:40.631
Like a test?

21:40.632 --> 21:42.600
You were the only one
who caught it,

21:42.601 --> 21:45.695
and faster
than anyone anticipated.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.105
So good work.

21:48.106 --> 21:52.975
That leak was transmitted over
an unsecure net connection.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.211
Isn't that a little risky?

21:54.212 --> 21:57.579
Security Section was
surveilling it the whole time.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.650
I just wanted to let you know.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.151
Okay. Thanks.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.514
- Yes?
- Dad? Where's Vaughn?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.683
I had his number forwarded.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.318
Are you all right?

22:34.319 --> 22:36.819
I'm at the safe house.

22:37.789 --> 22:38.956
Any trouble finding it?

22:38.957 --> 22:40.191
Only took six hours

22:40.192 --> 22:41.859
of driving through the forest
in the dark.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.360
Is Shepard with you?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.330
Yes.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.532
Get to Rinas Airport in Tirana.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.301
There's a charter flight
waiting for you

22:50.302 --> 22:52.002
under Kraja Petrol Corp.

22:52.003 --> 22:53.971
The hardest part's over, Sydney.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.472
We'll talk when you get back.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.287
Why me?

23:10.288 --> 23:13.883
Why did you
ever come talk to me?

23:16.328 --> 23:18.195
I was looking for a man.

23:18.196 --> 23:19.497
Who?

23:19.498 --> 23:23.366
The man who you killed
and buried.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.935
His name was Gareth Parkishoff.

23:26.004 --> 23:28.504
That's what
I was sent in to find.

23:28.573 --> 23:31.073
A man I killed.

23:32.377 --> 23:35.574
The first time I had
the images in my head,

23:35.647 --> 23:38.147
it was like...

23:38.250 --> 23:40.151
...a seizure.

23:40.152 --> 23:44.248
Flashes of people, places.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.657
A street sign.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.426
I thought I was remembering
bad dreams

23:48.427 --> 23:50.428
because it was
in black and white,

23:50.429 --> 23:51.929
but it was so vivid.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.430
It was so vivid.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.366
I didn't know how much
of it was real.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.272
I found the street.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.343
I heard there had been a murder.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.310
A shopkeeper recognized me.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.854
I was convinced
I had to be delusional.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.415
I couldn't be a killer.

24:24.696 --> 24:30.896
Where you found me
was as remote a place

24:30.969 --> 24:36.373
as I could find
to lock myself away in case...

24:38.376 --> 24:40.311
...in case I was wrong.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.812
It's not your fault.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.754
I feel like I've been stolen...

24:53.892 --> 24:55.359
...from myself.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.852
I don't know
if there was ever a me.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.798
I don't know who...

25:05.470 --> 25:07.204
Please tell me
who you are, Sydney.

25:07.205 --> 25:08.739
Maybe that will help me
to understand.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.240
How did you know my name?

25:11.676 --> 25:14.176
I don't...

25:14.679 --> 25:17.179
How did you know my name?

25:25.624 --> 25:28.124
The banner.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.693
What banner?

25:34.866 --> 25:37.767
It said
"Happy Birthday, Sydney."

25:47.245 --> 25:51.409
I heard the water running.

26:30.188 --> 26:33.351
I'm so sorry.

26:54.879 --> 26:57.379
Oh!

27:28.279 --> 27:31.510
The man you were ordered
to kill was my fiancé.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.083
His name was Danny.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.365
I told Danny...

27:51.302 --> 27:56.672
...I'm a spy because he was
the one part of my life

27:56.741 --> 27:59.241
I couldn't stand to be a lie.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.743
And when SD-6 found out,

28:03.815 --> 28:05.749
they called on one
of their hit men.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.250
Someone they'd already enlisted.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.855
They called on you.

28:17.228 --> 28:20.095
I think the man
who programmed you

28:20.165 --> 28:22.566
is named McCullough.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.201
He's their neuro tech.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.069
McCullough.

28:27.172 --> 28:30.733
Yeah. Yeah.

28:30.842 --> 28:33.342
He's in here.

28:35.613 --> 28:39.709
The irony is they never lied
to me about what would happen

28:39.784 --> 28:42.119
if I told someone.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.521
It was the one thing they said
that turned out to be true.

28:49.627 --> 28:53.028
Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA.

28:54.599 --> 28:57.534
And I will be
until SD-6 is gone.

28:57.602 --> 29:00.102
Will...

29:03.141 --> 29:06.440
...finding where
Parkishoff is buried...

29:08.213 --> 29:10.080
...help you to take down
the people

29:10.081 --> 29:11.582
that did this to us?

29:11.583 --> 29:14.083
Yes.

29:17.856 --> 29:22.088
I left his body in marshland

29:22.160 --> 29:26.358
on the Louisiana-Texas border

29:26.431 --> 29:28.931
off the I-10.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.658
So that's the deal?

29:59.430 --> 30:03.059
Shepard wrote down the location
of Parkishoff's body.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.303
In exchange, I helped him
escape the asylum.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.474
I see.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.975
Where's Shepard now?

30:14.279 --> 30:16.779
He committed suicide.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.916
Something went wrong
with his programming.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.151
He started remembering
what he'd done.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.652
Snapped.

30:24.189 --> 30:28.421
When we were crossing
over the border into Bulgaria,

30:28.493 --> 30:29.827
he jumped.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.059
Threw himself off the bridge
into Lake Scutari.

30:33.131 --> 30:35.861
There is no way
he could have survived.

30:41.272 --> 30:43.307
If by some miracle
he did survive,

30:43.308 --> 30:45.902
I'm sure we'll hear about it
sooner or later.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.447
I told SD-6 Shepard was dead.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.482
I was going to lie to you
about it, too,

30:52.483 --> 30:54.618
but the truth is...

30:54.619 --> 30:57.213
I can't stand lying
to anyone else.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.589
Well, I appreciate that.

31:01.826 --> 31:02.926
I'll be honest with you, too.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.487
There are people at the agency
who will want him found.

31:06.497 --> 31:09.466
He's as much a victim
of SD-6 as I am.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.432
Shepard buried Parkishoff's body
in a Louisiana marshland.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.770
Sloane sent out a forensics team
to get a DNA sample.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.209
They should be able to use it

31:19.210 --> 31:21.710
to decode the FTL message
by tonight.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.480
We were worried.

31:23.481 --> 31:26.746
Yeah, I know the CIA hates
to lose its assets.

31:26.818 --> 31:31.221
No, I mean I was worried
for you.

31:32.657 --> 31:36.684
In fact,
I contacted your father.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.797
Just so you know,

31:40.798 --> 31:44.165
he knows I pulled his file,
and he suspects you've seen it.

31:48.206 --> 31:49.640
It's okay.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.409
It's me.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.910
Yeah, that's what I thought.

31:55.013 --> 31:56.446
Looks like
our SD-6 computer virus

31:56.447 --> 31:58.148
is turning out
to be a gold mine.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.182
Good.

31:59.183 --> 32:01.683
Maybe we can get ahead
of them for once.

32:02.553 --> 32:05.053
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

32:05.056 --> 32:07.556
Happy Thanksgiving.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.559
Oh, God.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.631
Francie?

32:14.632 --> 32:17.132
Okay, were you ever gonna
call me back?

32:17.135 --> 32:18.135
I'm sorry.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.661
Where the hell have you been?
I left three messages.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.205
I know.
My trip was extended.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.902
- You can't just disappear.
- What's burning?

32:24.976 --> 32:26.310
It's just a little oven fire.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.678
I just moved in here.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.179
I fricasseed the turkey.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.117
You okay?

32:38.222 --> 32:40.722
I'm glad to be home.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.792
Okay, but the turkey's
really burning.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.362
It's burning.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.496
Oh, great.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.664
Ooh.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.900
Francie, what'd you do?

32:49.901 --> 32:53.098
<i># Can you tell me
I want to believe #</i>

32:53.204 --> 32:59.143
<i># That you want to be
with me forever? #</i>

32:59.243 --> 33:03.270
<i># I need to know
that you won't ever leave #</i>

33:03.348 --> 33:07.751
<i># And you won't run away
from me never #</i>

33:09.854 --> 33:13.119
<i># I've been waiting
for a long time #</i>

33:13.191 --> 33:17.685
<i># For the one
who would be mine #</i>

33:17.762 --> 33:21.562
<i># I think it's time #</i>

33:23.935 --> 33:28.031
<i># Everything's all right #</i>

33:28.673 --> 33:29.673
Hey.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.774
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:30.775 --> 33:34.267
Oh, Sydney, this is Jenny.

33:34.379 --> 33:35.545
She works with me.

33:35.546 --> 33:37.948
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.916
Thanks for letting me
crash your party.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.752
I would have totally
brought some wine,

33:41.753 --> 33:43.653
but I got carded.

33:43.654 --> 33:44.921
So, cider.

33:44.922 --> 33:47.190
- Cider's perfect. Thank you.
- Okay.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.691
Come in.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.424
Wow. You look great.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.866
Is that the sweater
I got you for Christmas?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.968
Yeah.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.469
That's not why I wore it.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.373
I'm going to go
put that on ice.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.874
Okay.

34:06.911 --> 34:07.944
She's cute.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.679
Hmm? Yeah.
It's the new intern.

34:09.679 --> 34:13.047
Her parents are in Europe,
so, you know, I felt bad.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.885
- That's Jenny.
- Mm-hmm.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.219
It's strictly professional.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.321
Really?

34:18.322 --> 34:19.489
What are you saying?

34:19.489 --> 34:21.989
Oh, nothing.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.195
Happy Thanksgiving.

34:25.196 --> 34:26.797
Cheers, guys.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.465
<i># I think it's time
I think #</i>

34:28.466 --> 34:33.369
<i># Everything's all right #</i>

34:33.471 --> 34:37.271
<i># The way
that you believe in me #</i>

34:37.341 --> 34:42.802
<i># And it takes me
through the night #</i>

34:42.880 --> 34:48.011
<i># I fall beside you
softly singing #</i>

34:48.085 --> 34:50.585
Are your parents really away?

34:52.223 --> 34:54.723
Jenny?

35:03.401 --> 35:06.802
Somebody's always
got to bang the glass.

35:08.239 --> 35:09.773
This year, it's me.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.039
I wanted all of you to be here
for what I'm about to do,

35:13.111 --> 35:15.479
which is probably going to be

35:15.480 --> 35:18.381
one of the most
embarrassing moments ever.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.347
But this thing is burning
a hole in my pocket.

35:33.564 --> 35:36.064
Francie...

35:36.300 --> 35:38.800
You're my last stop, baby.

35:40.671 --> 35:43.171
Will you marry me?

35:45.843 --> 35:47.377
Yes.

35:47.378 --> 35:50.176
Yes, Charlie, I will.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.754
Okay, watch the tongue.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.760
You're something else.

36:05.429 --> 36:08.330
Glad you're taking it slow.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.907
Dad.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.378
This was on your lawn.

36:26.450 --> 36:27.918
It's my neighbor's.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.286
I'll give it to him.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.787
Oh.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.459
Do you want to come...

36:36.460 --> 36:39.429
Shepard killed Danny.
I'm assuming you know that.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.331
If I hadn't,

36:41.332 --> 36:44.199
thank you for breaking it
to me so gently.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.570
I'm telling you because
I don't want you to think

36:46.571 --> 36:49.165
it's my mission in life
to keep things from you.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.773
Then why do you?

36:54.979 --> 36:58.506
FBI report signed by the
deputy director under Carter,

36:58.583 --> 37:03.282
clearing me of having
any involvement with the KGB.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.488
Sydney, you have to understand

37:05.489 --> 37:07.857
it was the height
of the Cold War.

37:07.858 --> 37:10.293
After they caught
Boyce and Lee in '77,

37:10.294 --> 37:12.990
everybody was under suspicion.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.765
So I suppose in a way...

37:19.237 --> 37:22.263
...your mother's accident
was my fault,

37:22.373 --> 37:26.309
since the FBI was after me.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.307
If I could give her back
to you, I would.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.186
Take it.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.689
I don't need to.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.294
You should stay.

37:44.295 --> 37:46.795
Work.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.932
I'm glad your trip went well.

37:53.304 --> 37:55.372
Happy Thanksgiving.

37:55.373 --> 37:57.873
You too.

38:15.092 --> 38:18.323
We found Parkishoff's body
and ran a DNA sample

38:18.396 --> 38:21.194
through the genetic decoder
you obtained last week.

38:21.265 --> 38:24.393
It decoded the FTL communiqué.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.198
Here's the full text.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.805
"Possible location
of Rambaldi artifact

38:29.874 --> 38:31.408
discovered in Tunisia.

38:31.409 --> 38:32.776
Dig proceeding."

38:32.777 --> 38:34.778
Now we know
where all those FTL agents

38:34.779 --> 38:37.279
went off to in such a hurry.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.683
So I'm off to Tunisia.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.785
Actually, no.

38:41.786 --> 38:44.346
We sent an advance team there
on a recon mission.

38:44.422 --> 38:47.391
By the time they got there,
the dig had been evacuated.

38:47.458 --> 38:50.086
FTL must have found
whatever was buried there.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.221
We then traced the shipment
out of El Kef

38:53.297 --> 38:55.797
to the Department of
Engineering Science at Oxford.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.168
FTL has no idea
what they've uncovered,

38:58.169 --> 38:59.436
or else they wouldn't risk

38:59.437 --> 39:01.838
sending it to civilians
for analysis.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.007
But whatever it is,

39:04.008 --> 39:06.109
some of the best minds
in the world

39:06.110 --> 39:08.610
are studying it as we speak.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.848
The university
is holding a reception

39:11.849 --> 39:14.349
for visiting professors
tomorrow night.

39:14.418 --> 39:17.285
You're going as a scout
for the Marissa Foundation

39:17.355 --> 39:19.823
looking for grant candidates.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.987
Now, Sydney,
keep in mind that FTL

39:23.060 --> 39:25.195
is likely to have
a large presence there

39:25.196 --> 39:28.825
to make sure that we don't try
what we are about to try.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.429
In the interest of fairness,
I reread your notes last night.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.638
No, I know.
There wasn't much there anyway.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.540
You just need
a lot more shoe leather

39:37.541 --> 39:39.776
if you want to go with
the story you're looking for.

39:39.777 --> 39:40.377
You're right.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.545
I think it's better
if we just drop the whole thing.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.681
You've got enough
for an initial piece

39:44.682 --> 39:46.583
on why the police
are not more curious.

39:46.584 --> 39:50.213
Take it from that angle.
We go to press on Tuesday.

39:51.522 --> 39:54.650
Well, wait, wait.
I'm not... I mean, wow.

39:54.725 --> 39:55.859
Thank you.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.827
Um, Tuesday, though?
Is that set?

39:57.828 --> 39:59.863
- Will, are you on dope?
- Huh?

39:59.864 --> 40:01.398
Just 24 hours ago,

40:01.399 --> 40:02.599
you were begging me
to publish this.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.467
I know.
Here's the thing.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.136
Danny Hecht.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.238
The murder that started
this whole thing.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.697
He was my friend's fiancé.

40:11.809 --> 40:12.809
I just...

40:12.810 --> 40:16.007
After seeing her last night,
I'm having second thoughts.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.781
She doesn't know
that I was doing this story.

40:17.782 --> 40:18.948
Why didn't you tell her?

40:18.949 --> 40:20.617
I'd think she'd want someone
to investigate it.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.552
I did tell her a while ago,

40:22.553 --> 40:25.647
and she asked me
as a favor to drop it.

40:25.723 --> 40:27.590
I don't want to hurt her.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.754
Oh, I'm genuinely sorry
to hear that, Will,

40:30.828 --> 40:32.529
because this is now
a legitimate piece,

40:32.530 --> 40:35.260
and if you don't want it,
I will give it to somebody else.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.832
Don't chicken out on me now.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.272
Whatever the Rambaldi artifact
turns out to be,

40:42.273 --> 40:43.807
the CIA wants photographs of it.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.241
You'll do it in your hotel room.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.410
We'll plant a sub-mini camera
in the Bible.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.446
There's one more thing.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.144
One of our Romanian assets
spotted Anna Espinosa

40:53.217 --> 40:56.118
leaving the psychiatric hospital
after you escaped.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.687
Be careful. She's on this.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.664
How was your Thanksgiving?

41:07.665 --> 41:09.766
Good.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.267
My friend got engaged.

41:11.268 --> 41:13.768
What's her name?

41:15.072 --> 41:17.572
Francie.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.375
How was yours?

41:19.376 --> 41:23.278
Uh, typical.
Spent it with my mom.

41:23.347 --> 41:25.847
What about Alice?

41:26.517 --> 41:28.785
Yeah. We broke up.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.286
Oh.

41:31.555 --> 41:33.823
<i># Been walking
through the streets #</i>

41:33.824 --> 41:37.282
<i># And finding sweet relief
in knowing that #</i>

41:37.361 --> 41:39.861
<i># It won't be long #</i>

41:41.632 --> 41:46.194
<i># Oh, lately
it's occurred to me #</i>

41:46.303 --> 41:49.739
<i># That I've had enough
of that #</i>

41:51.375 --> 41:55.175
<i># And lately I've been
satisfied by simple things #</i>

41:55.246 --> 42:00.377
<i># Like breathing in
and breathing out #</i>

42:01.719 --> 42:07.351
<i># Never again,
not in this life #</i>

42:07.424 --> 42:09.924
<i># Will I be #</i>

42:09.927 --> 42:12.427
<i># Taken twice #</i>

42:16.333 --> 42:18.801
<i># Never again, no #</i>

42:18.802 --> 42:21.930
<i># Never on your life #</i>

42:22.039 --> 42:23.873

Security Section
