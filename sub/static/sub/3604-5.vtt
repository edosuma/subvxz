But only if you can
master your urges.

just understanding
how things work.

00:49.634 --> 00:50.714
There's a hunger.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.928

So why am / filled
with self-doubt?

01:36.347 --> 01:41.341
Plagued by demons,
real and imaginary.

01:43.521 --> 01:48.811
Frightened by the challenges
ahead, and haunted
by the ghosts of my past.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.311

you happy, Nathan.

would make me happy?
Some straight answers.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.391

she was in trouble.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.692
You mean Tracy?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.901
You said she needed my help.
That she was my path.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.275
Next thing I know,
she's taking a header
into the Potomac.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.830
And you were there to
save her. Now, I suppose
you're wondering why.

02:45.916 --> 02:49.408
I mean, was it luck?
Was it coincidence?

02:49.545 --> 02:52.912
Or perhaps guidance
from a higher power?

02:59.430 --> 03:02.342
You're not a messenger
from God.

And I've got a dead
mobster telling me
he's the voice of God.

You think the answers to
your questions are somehow
outside of you, Nathan,

03:22.286 --> 03:25.403

That was an accident.

14:53.185 --> 14:57.645

Over what?
A broken lawn mower?

15:01.151 --> 15:02.732
We got into an argument.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.397
It got heated, l overreacted.
Next thing I knew,
he was gone.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.993
I didn't want
to hurt him.

Just give me a head start
before you call your friends
at the Company.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.427
Maybe I can help.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.683
You tried to kill yourself.
How do I know you're not
gonna do it again?

16:21.773 --> 16:25.265
What do you want
from me, Nathan?
Undying gratitude?

16:26.570 --> 16:28.526
Thanks,
you're my hero.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.525
I want to know
what you were doing
on that bridge.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.152
I can't talk about it.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.163
Why not?

16:39.124 --> 16:43.163

better than I am?
Just tell me.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.581
What happened?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.794
I killed someone.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.346
Who?

16:56.433 --> 16:57.513
A reporter.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.054
He threatened to run
a story saying
that l was Niki Sanders.

17:03.148 --> 17:06.481
When there was no way
that I could reason with him,

17:07.777 --> 17:10.860
I got angry,
I reached out
to grab him,

17:11.740 --> 17:14.527
froze him.
He shattered.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.325
It was an accident,
Tracy.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.027
I need to turn myself in.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.996
That's probably not
a good idea. What are you
gonna tell them, Tracy?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.549
I can fly,
but I can't
talk about it.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.046
Well,
then I'll show them.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.638

17:36.723 --> 17:40.932
Listen, I've been there.
I understand, I...

17:41.019 --> 17:43.635
I wanted to tell the world,
I even called
a press conference.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.269

And I truly believe with
all my heart that he's got
a higher purpose for us.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.702
You think
God gave us
these powers?

18:00.789 --> 18:02.154

Who did?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.618

31:29.597 --> 31:31.553
I'll make you a deal,
Stephen.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.177
My partner is standing
right over there by my car.

31:34.268 --> 31:38.056
You make him disappear,
and this is all over.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.980
I don't understand,
you want me to
kill your partner?

31:45.321 --> 31:46.436
(lNAUDlBLE)

31:46.781 --> 31:50.194
Do it, and I'll let you go.
I give you my word.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.946
What are you saying?
You do not have to do this.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.368
Stay out of this, Claire.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.741
She's right, I can't.
I'm not a killer.

31:56.832 --> 32:01.201
Maybe not, but he is,
and he needs
to be destroyed.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.832
Unfortunately,
I can't do it.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.504
Please...
I'm not asking.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.666
Dad,no.

32:10.054 --> 32:13.546
I'm doing this for us, Claire.
For what Sylar did to you.

32:17.311 --> 32:22.556
You people,
you've taken
everything from me.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.772
Do it. Kill him, now.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.193
What are you doing?

32:37.206 --> 32:38.867
I won't be a monster.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.202
No.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.048
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

32:54.682 --> 32:55.671
(EXHALES)

32:55.766 --> 32:58.553
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

33:23.502 --> 33:25.117
Hello, boys.

33:25.963 --> 33:26.998
Nemesis.

33:28.591 --> 33:31.799
So, my friend here
tells me that
you're looking for work.

33:31.886 --> 33:36.505
And I said,
"That's not possible.
Those goody two-shoes?"

33:40.769 --> 33:45.183
We heard about
what you are doing.
Sign us up.

33:45.274 --> 33:46.354
I'm not convinced.

33:46.442 --> 33:48.558
We have changed.
We are badasses now.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.768
Yes, we are very badass.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.530
When do we start?
Not so fast.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.448
You have to prove
yourself worthy.

33:57.953 --> 33:58.942
How do we do that?

33:59.038 --> 34:01.199
You're the one
with the powers?
Yes.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.951
I control time and space.

34:04.668 --> 34:05.874
Cool.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.467
Kill the other one.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.636
KiII Ando?
KiII Ando?

34:17.723 --> 34:21.090
Yeah, he has no powers.
What good is he to us?

34:22.645 --> 34:25.261
You kill him,
you are badass.

34:32.446 --> 34:33.947
I'm sorry,
my friend.

34:35.199 --> 34:39.533
I must make
some sacrifices
to save the world.

34:41.455 --> 34:42.410
(GROANING)

34:42.498 --> 34:43.487
(DAPHNE GASPING)

34:50.089 --> 34:51.329
Hiro.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.230
We'll talk more when
I come home, okay?

35:16.365 --> 35:17.730
Claire, wait.

35:18.742 --> 35:23.611
I know you're disappointed,
but I did what I had to do.

35:23.706 --> 35:24.946
For us.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.874
She doesn't believe
a word you're saying.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.206
She knows exactly
what you did back there.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.960
Why you didn't
take down Stephen Canfield
when you had the chance.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.301
Nobody's talking to you.

35:36.385 --> 35:40.549
Claire finally sees you
for what you are. A user.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.630
Isn't that right, Claire?

35:42.725 --> 35:44.465
You used her to try
to find that poor man,

35:44.560 --> 35:50.556
then you used him to try
to kill me, because to you
I'm nothing but a monster.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.277
He doesn't see
our humanity, Claire.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.069
He never will.

35:58.741 --> 36:02.233
Wait. You're not gonna
listen to him, are you?

36:02.328 --> 36:04.910
The man is
a deranged sociopath.
He's a killer.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.828
He's a monster.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.325
Yes.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.658
And you're my daughter.

36:10.753 --> 36:15.338
And everything I do
is to protect you.

36:15.424 --> 36:20.669
To protect this family.
Tell me you understand that.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.434
I understand.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.016
(SIGHING)

36:34.360 --> 36:36.271
It's all gonna be okay.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.649
I promise.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.523
Mom.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.400
SANDRA: Claire.

36:44.495 --> 36:48.113
Thank God,
l was so worried.

36:48.207 --> 36:51.040
Are you okay?
Because if you are,
you're so grounded.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.825
(SIGHING)
I'm sorry.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.127
I'm just glad
Meredith found you.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.755
Meredith?

37:00.302 --> 37:04.545

my dear? Eat.

(SIGHS)

37:21.323 --> 37:25.566
Now, give me
a sweet kiss.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.822

you filthy...

Peter, tell me
you didn't
do this, please.

(GASPS)

(GASPING)

38:51.413 --> 38:52.402
MAN: Hello, Angela.

38:52.498 --> 38:55.114
No, it can't be.

38:56.460 --> 39:01.170
You can see the future.
I can't have that.
That's too dangerous.

39:01.256 --> 39:05.090
No, you won't succeed.
I'll stop you.

39:05.177 --> 39:06.883
Don't be ridiculous.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.004
You won't even
be able to move.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.898
ARTHUR:
You won’t even
be able to move.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.663
LINDERMAN: You're late.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.287
Have you completed
yourtask?

39:39.378 --> 39:40.584
They're on board.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.707
Even the Japanese guy.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.548
I'm not happy
about what happened.

39:46.635 --> 39:49.126
That's not what
I signed up for.
I'm not a killer.

39:50.264 --> 39:53.552
Well, it's all part
of making the world
a better place, Daphne.

39:53.642 --> 39:55.849
No pain, no gain.

39:56.979 --> 40:00.392
There's another one
you're going
to have to recruit.

40:00.482 --> 40:03.815
I'm afraid he's going
to be the most difficult.

40:09.950 --> 40:13.283
Matt Parkman?
What's his thing?

40:13.370 --> 40:17.113
He has the ability
to alter your mind.

40:17.207 --> 40:22.622
Put thoughts into your head.
Make you see things
that aren't there.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.420
Speaking of which,

40:25.507 --> 40:28.340
I finally figured out
what's been bugging me
aboutyou.

40:30.262 --> 40:35.507
I'm fast. Real fast.
I can sneak up
on everybody.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.347
Butlcant
sneak up on you.

40:46.403 --> 40:47.518
(GASPS)

40:47.613 --> 40:50.980
I knew it.
You're not really there.

40:51.825 --> 40:56.535
It's not your concern, Daphne.
Just bring me Parkman.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.083
I guess I don't really
have a choice, do I?

41:25.567 --> 41:28.058
(ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATOR
PUMPING)

41:39.164 --> 41:40.995
The team is coming
together nicely.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.875
Everything went fine,
perfect with Nathan.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.121
I messed with his head,

41:49.216 --> 41:51.673
gave him
visions of Linderman,
just like you asked.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.842
Now he thinks
he's doing God's work.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.929
Yes.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.424
Very real.

42:02.604 --> 42:07.189
Daphne is spreading the word.
We're building an army
just like you...

42:10.570 --> 42:14.563
Sorry. Knox called
just a few minutes ago.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.612
He'll have Adam Monroe
here by tomorrow.

42:20.455 --> 42:21.615
Right.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.281
Absolutely.

Whatever you say goes,
Mr. Petrelli.
