Hey, 6:30.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.542
- I'll be right down.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.583
- Leslie wants you to call
her before the interview.

02:13.583 --> 02:16.291
And about the script,
she sent over a few more

02:16.291 --> 02:18.750
she thinks you should consider.

02:18.750 --> 02:19.959
I booked my flight
for a Thursday.

02:19.959 --> 02:23.291
We got almost 40 emails.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.458
I mean, I guess it is

02:24.458 --> 02:26.625
a rent-stabilized
apartment in Brooklyn.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.583
Also, Madeline wanted me to
remind you about her brunch.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.709
She says you really
shouldn't miss it,

02:31.709 --> 02:34.458
'cause he is really
cute and sweet,

02:34.458 --> 02:37.083
and it's time for you to, Anna?

02:53.750 --> 02:57.208
- Yup, I've been
reading them all week.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.250
You know, I'd rather wait.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.917
I just want to give them
a little more thought.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.917
Okay, Leslie, I gotta
go, I'm late, I'm late.

03:10.917 --> 03:11.792
Okay, bye.

03:17.834 --> 03:18.750
You're an angel.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.709
- Are you ready?

03:19.709 --> 03:20.750
You got to go, or
you're gonna be late.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.375
- Okay.

03:22.917 --> 03:25.166
Where are my keys?

03:25.166 --> 03:26.000
- Oh, I thought maybe I would
just come with you today

03:26.000 --> 03:27.792
and hang out and
watch the scene.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.667
- No, absolutely not, you're
supposed to be writing today.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.542
Take your pen, wield it.

03:35.458 --> 03:35.500
I'm fine.

03:36.875 --> 03:41.041
- Approximately
2,500 people are believed to
have died

03:41.041 --> 03:44.750
or gone missing trying to
reach Europe so far this year.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.917
On Sunday, 37 people
died when a boat capsized

03:46.917 --> 03:50.041
off the Libyan coast.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.542
This came just days after
another boat capsized

03:52.542 --> 03:56.458
off the Libyan coast,
killing more than 200 people.

03:56.458 --> 03:57.709
Meanwhile investigators
in Hungary

03:57.709 --> 04:01.500
and Austrian authorities are
continuing to probe the deaths

04:01.500 --> 04:04.834
of 71 people who were
found abandoned last week

04:04.834 --> 04:08.417
inside a truck on the
main highway between--

04:17.458 --> 04:18.000
- Hello.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.208
Yes, I'll hold.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.834
Hi, Dan, how are you?

04:26.959 --> 04:28.583
Okay.

04:28.583 --> 04:28.625
Sure.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.583
Well, I just wanted to talk
to you about his one beat

04:32.583 --> 04:34.375
that's been, I don't know.

04:34.375 --> 04:38.333
It's just sort of
been bothering me.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.583
I think we've seen this
coffee spilling thing,

04:43.583 --> 04:46.750
this stumble thing a few
times, and I'm just wondering

04:46.750 --> 04:49.917
about playing that jealousy
over and over again.

04:49.917 --> 04:53.375
I feel like it
diminishes the character.

04:55.375 --> 04:58.000
She's an award-winning
journalist.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.333
Fine, blogger.

05:00.333 --> 05:00.542
- All right.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.625
These labs are looking great.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.000
This is good news.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.917
- But it could come back?

05:14.917 --> 05:17.625
- Listen, these autoimmune
diseases are tricky.

05:17.625 --> 05:20.500
The chemo and steroids
are tough on the body,

05:20.500 --> 05:23.208
but it does look like
you're taking too long

05:23.208 --> 05:25.458
to build up your adrenals.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.291
We could put you
back on steroids,

05:27.291 --> 05:29.667
but I prefer you just
try to slow down.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.083
Are you sleeping?

05:32.208 --> 05:34.333
- Not so much.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.041
- Looks like you need a
refill for the Wellbutrin.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.500
How's it working for you?

05:38.500 --> 05:38.959
- You know, I'm not sure.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.417
- Your
wife on line two.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.166
- Have her hold on for a moment.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.417
Why don't we up the dose

05:49.417 --> 05:52.917
and see how you
feel in a few weeks?

05:58.750 --> 06:01.917
- Oh, and I need a
refill on the Ritalin.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.291
- Oh we talked about this.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.166
- Just 'til we wrap.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.834
- I'm sorry.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.083
Honey, what's up?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.709
I'm with a patient.

06:13.542 --> 06:14.417
Oh.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.500
- The
interview's 90 minutes.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.458
You have that fitting,
the luncheon thing,

06:38.458 --> 06:40.417
oh, sorry, we canceled that.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.083
This Thursday, Leslie's
coming over at 10.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.250
She has a hard out at noon.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.458
She wanted to make sure

06:45.458 --> 06:46.750
you finished reading
all the scripts.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.166
She's being really
Leslie about it.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.542
Plus that call with with
Paula to do your social media.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.750
The car is coming at eight.

06:53.750 --> 06:57.041
I'll be there by six,
and Isaac called again.

06:58.083 --> 06:58.625
You still there?

07:16.834 --> 07:17.709
- No!

07:22.083 --> 07:23.375
- Anna, let me in.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.625
Come on!

07:37.834 --> 07:38.709
- Out!

07:42.583 --> 07:44.625
You know, I would just
like to be heard out

07:44.625 --> 07:47.125
on some of these
creative decisions.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.000
- I can't call a summit
every time you have a problem

07:50.000 --> 07:51.125
with the scene.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.041
Anna, the whole crew is
on set waiting for you.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.417
- I was thinking it
might be interesting.

07:55.417 --> 07:57.125
What if we just reversed it?

07:57.125 --> 07:58.959
- Please, just let it go.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.041
It's just who she is.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.291
- What does that mean?

08:04.291 --> 08:07.291
How do we even know what she is?

08:07.291 --> 08:10.417
I mean, she's just somebody
who gets shit dumped on her.

08:10.417 --> 08:11.458
The way she's been
written this season,

08:11.458 --> 08:14.125
she's become a cipher.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.041
I mean, does she care
about anything besides him.

08:16.041 --> 08:16.625
Yes, we get it.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.250
She's a workaholic.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.083
She has no personal life.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.583
Her friends are text messages.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.625
She's not a real person.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.750
She's like a profession.

08:25.750 --> 08:26.625
- I know it may be
a stretch for you,

08:26.625 --> 08:28.375
but I'm sure you
can find something

08:28.375 --> 08:31.375
in her you can relate to.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.833
- You got your coffee spill in.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.542
And there's a shitload
of typos in there.

08:46.542 --> 08:47.709
- Yeah, all right.

09:13.542 --> 09:16.458
- Because you are brilliant

09:16.458 --> 09:19.291
and charming and
incredibly annoying

09:19.291 --> 09:20.834
and frustratingly attractive,

09:20.834 --> 09:23.500
and if you just get out
of your own damn way,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.834
and let me, let us help you,

09:28.458 --> 09:29.250
we can do this.

09:29.250 --> 09:29.792
You can do this.

09:33.375 --> 09:33.875
You can do this!

09:36.041 --> 09:37.291
You can do this!

09:39.125 --> 09:42.875
My sources tell me my team
in Arabia is ready to go.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.709
You bastard!

09:44.709 --> 09:47.041
You know me Sam, and you
know I won't let this happen

09:47.041 --> 09:47.875
on my watch.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.625
You know, what's that book
we're all supposed to get

09:53.625 --> 09:55.000
when our husbands dump us?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.291
I mean, he didn't ,
he didn't dump me.

09:57.291 --> 09:59.250
I dumped him.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.083
Promise me he'll go to college.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.125
In my top drawer,
wait 'til I'm gone,

10:08.959 --> 10:10.166
but promise me,

10:11.417 --> 10:15.583
no, promise me, you'll
be good to your father.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.542
He sent the secretaries home.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.208
I knew the moment I saw you.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.041
You're the worst
mistake I've ever made,

10:31.041 --> 10:34.000
and I'll make it
every chance I get.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.625
- You're gonna cover
his fall semester,

10:46.625 --> 10:50.250
and I'm gonna pay
for the spring.

10:51.792 --> 10:55.625
Well, John, that isn't my
problem anymore, now, is it?

10:56.375 --> 10:58.583
Hold on a minute.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.500
Uh huh, well, has she
ever done this before?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.792
No, and did you get your shot?

11:04.792 --> 11:08.250
And how much coverage
did you really need

11:08.250 --> 11:10.375
on a fucking coffee spill?

11:11.834 --> 11:15.500
You have a brilliant, multiple
Emmy award-winning actress.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.625
You might want to think--

11:18.625 --> 11:23.500
Wait a minute, uh uh, I have
piles of offers for her.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.709
So if you can't
respect her process...

11:33.208 --> 11:34.083
Oh.

11:34.875 --> 11:37.667
Look, how 'bout
after the hiatus,

11:37.667 --> 11:40.166
we get together with the studio,

11:40.166 --> 11:41.291
and we discuss the direction

11:41.291 --> 11:46.000
of her character for the
second half of the season?

11:47.125 --> 11:47.166
All right.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.500
- It looks worse than it is.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.041
What would they do,
hypothetically, if
I broke my contract?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.834
- We're doing this again?

12:17.834 --> 12:19.542
- Could they sue me?

12:23.333 --> 12:26.000
You know I've been
phoning it in for months?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.875
- Everybody phones it
in, sooner or later.

12:28.875 --> 12:29.500
It's normal.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.125
- This is not normal.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.917
- What you really
need is just sit down

12:36.917 --> 12:41.583
and think about what
you really, really want,

12:42.250 --> 12:45.291
because you walked off set.

12:45.291 --> 12:49.208
And I don't even know
what to do with all this.

12:49.208 --> 12:52.709
Honey, you could have
fucked yourself up.

12:57.166 --> 12:57.208
- I can't.

13:17.959 --> 13:21.917
- You're not supposed
to drink coffee.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.875
- You're,

13:31.667 --> 13:33.625
you're really special.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.959
And I know how hard
you've worked for me.

13:38.959 --> 13:42.542
I don't know how to
explain this, but

13:42.542 --> 13:45.125
there's nothing left.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.000
I don't want to let you down.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.792
You've gotten me
everything I wanted.

13:51.792 --> 13:55.417
- Yeah, but what
do you want now?

13:57.792 --> 13:58.834
- I don't want to act anymore.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.834
- Oh I don't believe--

14:00.834 --> 14:02.000
- I'm serious.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.625
Are you mad at me?

14:11.667 --> 14:12.667
- That's not important.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.208
- I don't want
you to be mad at me.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.667
- And I don't want
you to regret it.

14:17.667 --> 14:20.458
- Do you think I'm a good actor?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.875
- I think you're a good actor.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.250
I'll call the lawyers.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.083
- Leslie, wait, Leslie!

14:57.208 --> 14:59.625
- I'll call you back.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.208
- Just tell me
what I have to do.

15:09.417 --> 15:12.250
- You have the
entire week off now.

15:12.250 --> 15:16.458
After that, we're gonna take
a meeting with the studio

15:16.458 --> 15:18.917
for contract renegotiations.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.250
At that time, we can bring
up all of your concerns

15:21.250 --> 15:26.083
for your character for the
second half of the season.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.458
In the meantime, just
take a break Anna,

15:30.625 --> 15:32.250
a real break, not a work break,

15:32.250 --> 15:36.500
not another charity drive,
not a cleanse, actual fun.

15:38.208 --> 15:41.583
And if you just can't
bear to do that,

15:41.583 --> 15:43.417
then at least unpack.

16:56.166 --> 17:00.333
- So I'm not going tonight,
so you can just go.

17:00.333 --> 17:17.666
Thanks.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.125
- I want to go to Coney Island!

20:32.125 --> 20:33.250
- But we
can't do it right now,

20:33.250 --> 20:36.333
because we have
somewhere else to go.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.458
- Speech, speech!

22:37.458 --> 22:40.834
Come on, babe, you've
got to give it to us.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.166
- Kate, Kate!

22:42.166 --> 22:43.208
Hands away.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.083
- Oh bloody hell, okay.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.625
Blessings to all, and a big
fuck you to my dear friend.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.625
- Anything for you.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.375
- Who knows how much
I love surprises.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.500
I'm very happy you're here.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.750
I don't know, I don't know
how I would've done it.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.542
That's enough.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.125
Oh, I don't believe
I just did that.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.875
Someone put on
Guns N' Roses now.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.458
Come on, party!

23:19.375 --> 23:21.500
- Cut a big slice of that.

23:27.083 --> 23:28.875
- Have fun!

23:28.875 --> 23:29.709
- Did I make it?

23:29.709 --> 23:29.750
Yes.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
That's why I'm
cutting it so well.

23:53.750 --> 23:54.208
- Just a little longer.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.208
- It's late.

23:56.208 --> 23:57.166
Anna?

23:57.166 --> 23:58.083
- Anna.

23:58.083 --> 23:58.667
- Hi.

23:58.667 --> 23:59.458
- Hey, hey.

23:59.458 --> 24:01.917
- I didn't know
you were in town.

24:01.917 --> 24:03.000
- Yeah, for a minute.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.125
- Hi there.

24:04.125 --> 24:04.959
- You made it.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.041
- I did.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.250
- That's so great.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.959
- Nancy's doing this
performance thing.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.083
At one of those galleries,

24:17.083 --> 24:18.458
I forget which one.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.792
But she doesn't look very good.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.083
Have you seen her lately?

24:22.083 --> 24:23.291
- No, no, I haven't.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.542
I haven't seen her for years.

24:24.542 --> 24:25.417
- Kate.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.375
- Wow.
- What?

24:27.375 --> 24:28.417
- What are you doing here?

24:28.417 --> 24:29.834
- Heidi, hi.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.625
- My God, Anna.

24:31.625 --> 24:32.417
- Surprise.

24:32.417 --> 24:33.625
- Nice surprise.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.208
- Kate.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.125
Kate, I got to go.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.125
- Jude's leaving, so--

24:39.125 --> 24:39.458
- I didn't know either.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.291
- Yeah.

24:41.291 --> 24:41.917
You're gonna stay
for a while, right?

24:41.917 --> 24:42.792
- Yeah.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.166
What was I thinking?

24:46.166 --> 24:47.000
- Just give her a minute.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.166
You know her.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.041
- Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.500
- You wanna drink?

24:51.500 --> 24:53.542
Oh wait, hold on.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.125
Hey, Suzanne, what's up?

24:56.125 --> 24:57.959
What's up?

24:57.959 --> 24:59.625
Wait, I can't hear you.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.625
All right, take care.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.250
Thanks for the call, bye.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.125
Hey!

25:13.083 --> 25:13.667
I fixed that scene.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.083
- Why didn't you tell
me she was coming?

25:17.083 --> 25:20.792
- Hey, she called, and
she asked about your 50th.

25:20.792 --> 25:25.667
It never occurred to me
that she'd actually show up.

25:25.667 --> 25:29.333
- You really should've
told me she was coming.

25:30.041 --> 25:32.208
She never remembers birthdays.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.333
- Ooh, birthdays, history,

25:35.625 --> 25:39.125
reflection, rejuvenation,
reunion, right?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.625
Survival.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.208
- I sold out, too.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.667
My kid's doing ballet.

25:48.667 --> 25:51.041
And that's her friend Julie.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.875
She's a hand, oh no, that's
Julie's kid right there.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.959
- Oh.

25:55.959 --> 25:58.709
- She's got attachment
issues, a handful.

25:58.709 --> 26:03.083
- Hi, we haven't met,
but I love your show.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.250
It's my total guilty pleasure.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.709
I have to ask.

26:05.709 --> 26:09.208
Can you give us any hints
about the next season?

26:09.208 --> 26:11.750
Like, do they finally hook up?

26:11.750 --> 26:15.041
- Oh.

26:15.041 --> 26:15.667
I really shouldn't.

26:19.625 --> 26:20.500
Okay.

26:22.417 --> 26:25.875
Actually, he has a nervous
breakdown, flips out,

26:25.875 --> 26:28.250
has to be institutionalized.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.250
She takes over.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.709
- Oh man.

26:31.709 --> 26:32.208
That is such a bummer.

26:32.208 --> 26:33.834
- Yeah.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.250
You can't tell anybody.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.375
- I won't, I promise.

26:40.375 --> 26:40.917
- Promise?
- Yeah.

26:40.917 --> 26:42.583
- Okay, I'm sorry,

26:42.583 --> 26:43.542
excuse me.
- Thank you.

26:43.542 --> 26:44.709
- I'll see you in a sec.

26:44.709 --> 26:47.875
- Oh my God.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.750
- Don't tweet it.

26:49.750 --> 26:50.208
- I saw the new issue.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.458
It's so good.

26:52.458 --> 26:53.792
- Who's that?

26:53.792 --> 26:55.250
- Flirting with your wife?

26:55.250 --> 26:57.208
That's Jacob Carter.

26:57.208 --> 26:58.917
He won the Henry
Prize last year.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.250
- Jacob is the editor
of Texte zur Kunst.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.250
This is Anna.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.083
- Charming to meet you.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.250
- Nice to meet you.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.458
- You know it's
just ontological BS.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.834
- Right.

27:09.834 --> 27:12.625
- What is Texte zur Kunst?

27:12.625 --> 27:15.917
- You don't know
Texte zur Kunst?

27:15.917 --> 27:16.375
- No.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.375
- You should.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.875
It's a magazine.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.250
- It's a brilliant magazine.

27:24.250 --> 27:25.083
- Oh if I may say so myself.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.959
The editing is
particularly good.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.125
- Oh you're so modest.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.125
- Yes, I know.

27:30.291 --> 27:32.458
- Anna doesn't
seem like herself.

27:32.458 --> 27:35.333
Have you shown her this?

27:38.041 --> 27:39.417
Isaac?

27:39.417 --> 27:40.208
- She's very good.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.959
You're very good.

27:41.959 --> 27:42.875
- Thank you, Nadia.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.125
- You're very modest, I'd say.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.834
- She's really modest.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.041
- You don't want
to know when I'm leaving.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.208
- When are you leaving?

28:00.208 --> 28:01.083
- Soon.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.166
I got a little present for you.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.166
- Oh come on.

28:13.208 --> 28:17.083
- It's just a key, just
for when you visit.

28:17.083 --> 28:17.959
Okay?

28:25.834 --> 28:29.917
- 55 bucks for
non-alcoholic champagne.

28:29.917 --> 28:30.667
It's insane.

28:51.959 --> 28:52.000
- You okay?

28:53.625 --> 28:54.583
- Yeah, mm hmm.

28:54.583 --> 28:57.583
- I thought you'd left.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.709
- I was gonna come say goodbye.

29:03.250 --> 29:04.750
- I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch.

29:04.750 --> 29:06.250
- No, that's okay.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.166
- Do you want us
to call you a car?

29:14.166 --> 29:15.542
- Actually, I'm staying
at my old place.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.333
- Frost Street?

29:17.333 --> 29:19.667
- Mm hmm.

29:19.667 --> 29:20.500
- I didn't know.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.375
- Yeah.

29:24.625 --> 29:27.333
- Why don't you stay for a bit?

29:28.959 --> 29:29.959
- You
haven't seen these?

29:29.959 --> 29:31.166
- Wow.

29:31.166 --> 29:35.458
- They're built
in pieces, like Legos.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.333
- I can't believe,
I walked in circles.

29:40.083 --> 29:44.333
- It's like some
post-apocalyptic project.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.250
- So is that where Heidi
lives, that one right there?

29:49.250 --> 29:51.250
- You see the big
crane, kind of dangling over it,

29:51.250 --> 29:51.583
next to that.

29:51.583 --> 29:52.083
- Oh.

29:54.583 --> 29:55.750
Are you okay here?

29:55.750 --> 29:57.166
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:59.458 --> 30:00.959
I'm still at the breakup.

30:00.959 --> 30:01.959
I didn't know.

30:01.959 --> 30:03.458
That must've been hard.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.709
- The day I broke up with him,

30:04.709 --> 30:06.208
I felt like I'd been
let out of a cult.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.625
- I hope you fucking
sue the asshole.

30:08.625 --> 30:11.667
- The thing is with addicts,
speaking from experience,

30:11.667 --> 30:13.375
if you can't live
in their reality,

30:13.375 --> 30:14.959
you can't live with them at all.

30:14.959 --> 30:17.291
- It's like most New Yorkers.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.959
- You should've seen it,
speaking from experience.

30:20.959 --> 30:25.625
- Addicts can be very, very
seductive, even sober ones.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.709
- Guys suck.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.750
- Speaking
from experience?

30:40.083 --> 30:42.208
- Damn, knockouts.

30:43.834 --> 30:44.834
- Do you remember?

30:44.834 --> 30:47.667
The first week of previews.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.041
- I look trashed.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.333
- Really, I don't see that.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.166
- Will I ever write
anything that good again?

30:57.875 --> 30:59.333
- I look so timid.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.500
- As if.

31:03.834 --> 31:04.667
- Oh sorry.

31:13.834 --> 31:14.667
- What?

31:14.667 --> 31:16.041
- That's a little loaded.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.375
- I didn't mean to be--

31:17.375 --> 31:18.125
- Of course you did.

31:27.041 --> 31:27.792
- Really?

31:27.792 --> 31:28.709
- What?

31:28.709 --> 31:31.291
My urine is 100% organic.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.709
- What's the story with Jude?

31:37.333 --> 31:40.083
- I don't know,
something Upstate.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.041
Why are you here?

31:44.875 --> 31:46.250
- You invited me.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.041
I have to deal
with my apartment.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.959
- Bullshit, you have Alex.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.542
Isn't that the point of
outsourcing your life?

31:55.542 --> 31:57.375
- Can't I just take a break?

31:57.375 --> 32:01.583
- No one comes to New York to
take a break, especially you.

32:02.834 --> 32:03.917
- It's okay.

32:05.417 --> 32:06.709
I'd love to come.

32:06.709 --> 32:07.750
- Oh it's nothing really.

32:07.750 --> 32:11.709
We just have to teach
one class to graduate.

32:14.125 --> 32:17.000
Well, I guess,
sure, if you want.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.291
- Okay.

32:19.291 --> 32:22.625
- All right, guys, I
love you but please go.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.208
- Something's off.

34:30.583 --> 34:33.917
- Take her on a date,
like a real date.

34:34.917 --> 34:36.708
- You know the going
rate for babysitters?

34:36.708 --> 34:37.875
- I could babysit.

34:37.875 --> 34:38.417
- You don't have time for that.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.667
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

34:40.667 --> 34:41.208
- Really?

34:41.208 --> 34:42.875
- Yeah, I want to.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.083
- Dana would love to
see her Auntie Anna.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.458
I might take you up on that.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.041
- Put your glasses on.

34:50.041 --> 34:50.917
- Why?

34:50.917 --> 34:53.000
- 'Cause I want you to.

35:00.291 --> 35:05.959
Now go home and tell her
she is the most amazing,

35:05.959 --> 35:09.542
beautiful, brilliant,
hottest woman you know

35:10.458 --> 35:13.291
and how lucky you
are to be with her.

35:14.959 --> 35:17.041
- You're manazing.

35:19.625 --> 35:20.667
- Again.

35:20.667 --> 35:21.000
- Okay.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.458
- Sober.

35:22.458 --> 35:23.333
- All right.

35:26.709 --> 35:28.917
You're amazing.

35:34.291 --> 35:35.375
- That's good.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.458
Good night.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.375
- Good night.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.750
- Hello.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.208
Hello.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.166
It's Derek and Kathy.

36:21.166 --> 36:24.166
We're here to see the apartment.

36:32.166 --> 36:36.125
Honey, I don't know
what's going on.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.208
- So the Twelve Nidanas,

37:21.375 --> 37:25.625
the Twelve Nidanas or
fetters as they call 'em,

37:25.625 --> 37:29.875
looks at attachments to
unhealthy habits and behaviors.

37:36.542 --> 37:39.083
No.

37:47.875 --> 37:48.834
Tense back.

37:51.583 --> 37:52.583
My jaw hurts.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.709
The rent check,

37:58.375 --> 37:59.875
I hate my landlord.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.208
Don't say hate.

38:03.625 --> 38:03.667
Think.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.375
Anna, what's that
place on Rivington?

38:11.458 --> 38:12.667
Those $3 beers.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.208
Ready?

38:30.291 --> 38:31.542
- You know, it was like
watching you on stage.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.125
You just throw out
the script and go.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.250
I could never do that.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.417
- It's more like
I was, who was it?

38:36.417 --> 38:42.083
You know ,
the rain on my face

38:42.083 --> 38:44.250
and the city, city pounding.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.458
- My tequila tongue.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.291
- My tequila
tongue!

38:47.291 --> 38:49.291
- Who thinks of that?

38:49.291 --> 38:50.875
- I don't know.

38:50.875 --> 38:52.875
But it's so
self-important, I want.

38:52.875 --> 38:55.375
- I need.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.291
- I need.

38:56.875 --> 38:58.709
- I need my sandwich.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.333
- Oh lovely.

39:05.834 --> 39:06.667
- I'm sorry.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.583
I've just seen
like every episode.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.458
You're amazing.

39:13.458 --> 39:14.417
- Thank you.

39:14.417 --> 39:17.208
- You know, I'm
actually an actor, too.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.500
And can I ask?

39:18.500 --> 39:22.709
I just, I'm really curious to
know how you got your start.

39:22.709 --> 39:26.917
Actually, you should ask my
friend Kate, Kate Mullen.

39:26.917 --> 39:28.166
She taught me everything.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.667
- Wow, cool.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.875
Wait, so you--

39:32.875 --> 39:35.750
- I forgot, I have
to return a call.

39:39.125 --> 39:39.959
- Do you mind if I just--

39:39.959 --> 39:41.709
- Oh no.

39:41.709 --> 39:43.083
- What did you do?

39:43.083 --> 39:43.959
- Um,

39:45.917 --> 39:46.875
well.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.500
- Think it through.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.959
Will it make you feel better?

39:51.875 --> 39:52.750
I know.

39:53.709 --> 39:55.667
Can you get to a meeting?

39:56.000 --> 39:56.625
Okay.

39:58.875 --> 40:03.166
Call me when you get
there and call me after.

40:03.166 --> 40:04.792
It's gonna be okay.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.083
- Thank you so much.

40:09.083 --> 40:09.583
It was so great to meet you.

40:09.583 --> 40:10.959
- You're welcome.

40:10.959 --> 40:11.875
Good luck with everything.

40:11.875 --> 40:12.709
- Have a good day.

40:12.709 --> 40:13.583
- Thank you.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.458
You're leaving?

40:20.458 --> 40:21.417
- I should get going.

40:21.417 --> 40:24.291
I got a few deadlines tomorrow.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.166
- Oh.

40:27.333 --> 40:28.917
What just happened?

40:30.542 --> 40:33.709
- You don't
have to do that.

40:33.709 --> 40:34.458
- I'm sorry.

40:34.458 --> 40:35.750
She was so sweet.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.041
- It's not that.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.250
I'm not an actor anymore.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.041
I don't want to be.

40:41.041 --> 40:42.709
It's like you're
trying to prop me up,

40:42.709 --> 40:44.834
as if I feel bad about it.

40:47.625 --> 40:48.417
- I'm sorry.

40:48.417 --> 40:49.667
I didn't--

40:49.667 --> 40:51.750
- What's really
going on with you?

40:51.750 --> 40:53.333
You look exhausted.

40:53.333 --> 40:57.709
And the compliments and my
birthday and coming to my class,

40:57.709 --> 40:59.166
you suddenly drop in my life

40:59.166 --> 41:02.166
and expect us to
be, I don't know.

41:02.166 --> 41:04.917
We haven't talked for
more than an hour.

41:04.917 --> 41:07.458
- I've been trying to
talk to you for years.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.875
- Phone messages
from the freeway

41:09.875 --> 41:12.417
in between meetings
at your hotel.

41:12.417 --> 41:13.166
- I'm sorry.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.041
That was awful.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.291
They wouldn't even
give me an hour.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.625
- It's really fine.

41:19.750 --> 41:20.291
We've moved on with our lives.

41:20.291 --> 41:21.583
Maybe it's better.

41:24.792 --> 41:26.625
- Not for me, it isn't.

41:27.959 --> 41:29.667
- I feel like you want
something from me,

41:29.667 --> 41:32.000
and I don't know what it is.

41:37.583 --> 41:38.458
Anna?

41:40.291 --> 41:41.125
Anna?

41:43.125 --> 41:45.375
- How did you know?

41:45.375 --> 41:46.667
- Know what?

41:46.667 --> 41:49.375
- That you weren't
an actor anymore.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.500
- What does it matter
what I'm doing?

41:53.500 --> 41:53.625
I'm not you.

42:08.250 --> 42:09.875
- Hey.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.583
- What is that?

42:11.583 --> 42:14.750
- Wall Street, moving in.

42:14.750 --> 42:15.709
- You okay?

42:15.709 --> 42:20.000
- I think Google's
replacing memory.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.250
- Why stop there?

42:22.250 --> 42:23.750
- Do you have a
scanner I can borrow?

42:23.750 --> 42:26.291
- It's
ancient, but yeah.

42:26.291 --> 42:27.917
Oh shit, hold on, Anna.

42:27.917 --> 42:29.041
- Why?

42:29.041 --> 42:30.542
- Honey, what
are you doing up?

42:30.542 --> 42:31.417
- Something--

42:31.417 --> 42:32.208
- Mommy's sleeping.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.166
- That already happened.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.417
- Can you
just wait one second?

42:34.417 --> 42:35.417
- What are you--

42:35.417 --> 42:37.125
- Daddy's
talking to Auntie Anna.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.208
Dana, no.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.000
- I want a cookie.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.291
- No cookies.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.083
Anna, I got to go.

42:41.083 --> 42:42.083
No, no, no.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.000
- That's silly.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.208
- Just come over here.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.375
Come over here.
- No.

42:45.375 --> 42:46.125
- Shh, shh,
shh, it's okay.

42:46.125 --> 42:46.750
- Hey, what's this thing?

42:46.750 --> 42:48.500
- It's all right.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.542
- I have no
idea what it is.

42:50.542 --> 42:53.667
- Come on, I'm
gonna go read you a story.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.917
- Me again,
just checking in.

43:10.917 --> 43:12.208
A few of the
applicants emailed me

43:12.208 --> 43:14.417
that no one answered the door.

43:14.417 --> 43:15.667
Are you okay?

43:55.625 --> 43:57.542
- Hi, Alex, it's Anna.

43:59.458 --> 44:02.291
Listen, I think I need
you to tell Leslie

44:02.291 --> 44:05.250
that things are a
little more complicated

44:05.250 --> 44:07.583
than I thought with
the apartments,

44:07.583 --> 44:10.959
stuff with the
landlord and repairs.

44:10.959 --> 44:14.125
So I think we need to
reschedule those meetings,

44:14.125 --> 44:17.208
and I'm gonna have
to push my flight.

44:17.750 --> 44:18.959
Okay, thanks, bye.

44:33.875 --> 44:37.125
Yeah.

44:37.834 --> 44:39.792
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

44:39.792 --> 44:43.500
It's not an overnight
process, yeah.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.458
I know you like the
conservative front,

44:45.458 --> 44:49.709
but I actually think the other
one's better for the brand.

44:51.208 --> 44:52.083
Yeah?

45:08.709 --> 45:09.583
One,

45:11.083 --> 45:12.000
two,

45:14.291 --> 45:15.166
operator.

45:21.291 --> 45:24.709
I've been on hold for an
hour every day this week.

45:24.709 --> 45:28.041
Can I please talk to a person?

45:44.709 --> 45:47.625
- So tell more.

45:47.625 --> 45:51.333
- Besides the pemphigus?

45:51.333 --> 45:54.333
- Your kidney is very thin.

45:54.333 --> 45:56.792
You don't have enough energy.

45:57.875 --> 46:01.208
- Sometimes I feel like
I'm not inside myself.

46:06.333 --> 46:08.750
Like I blank out.

46:11.417 --> 46:13.417
- Let me see your tongue.

46:19.083 --> 46:20.291
Are you married?

46:20.291 --> 46:21.000
- No.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.166
- Children?

46:22.166 --> 46:23.709
- No.

46:23.709 --> 46:26.166
- Hobbies?

46:26.166 --> 46:27.667
- Hobbies?

46:27.667 --> 46:31.458
- If someone asks Anna,
what do you most want,

46:32.583 --> 46:34.208
what would you say?

46:40.625 --> 46:41.792
- I've been asking myself
that question for 25 years

46:41.792 --> 46:45.250
about other people, characters.

46:47.959 --> 46:50.250
Really, people don't
know what they want.

46:50.250 --> 46:53.000
I mean, they say they
do, but I don't think so.

46:54.834 --> 46:58.208
What does it even mean to want?

46:59.291 --> 47:00.083
I wanted to be an actor.

47:00.083 --> 47:00.917
That's what I wanted.

47:04.959 --> 47:08.000
I don't know how to
do anything else.

51:15.208 --> 51:16.417
- This is unbelievable.

51:16.417 --> 51:18.625
Could you give us a minute?

51:22.375 --> 51:25.583
So what was it, that
pretentious suit,

51:25.583 --> 51:27.875
Text von Kunta, whatever?

51:27.875 --> 51:30.000
I guess he would never
take you to Honey's.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Where'd you go, some
swanky, hotel room?

51:38.083 --> 51:39.917
I've been really
preoccupied with work,

51:39.917 --> 51:42.583
and I'm gonna step up.

51:43.291 --> 51:44.709
- Please don't patronize me.

51:44.709 --> 51:45.917
How 'bout that?

51:45.917 --> 51:48.291
It's not about work.

51:48.291 --> 51:49.917
It's about growing up.

51:49.917 --> 51:52.166
And I feel like you wish
we lived in that dive bar.

51:52.166 --> 51:54.834
Like it holds the key to your
own fucking authenticity.

51:54.834 --> 51:56.875
But you are the one who wants
her to go to Montessori.

51:56.875 --> 51:58.500
You want her to eat organic.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.458
- Nadia!

52:00.458 --> 52:01.291
- How are we supposed
to pay for that?

52:01.291 --> 52:02.083
How do we pay for them?

52:02.083 --> 52:02.917
Without your gigs?

52:02.917 --> 52:03.959
No.

52:03.959 --> 52:06.583
Did it ever occur to
you one time, one time,

52:06.583 --> 52:08.333
that maybe I wanted
to keep writing

52:08.333 --> 52:09.959
and not have to
go to law school?

52:09.959 --> 52:11.709
- Hey, I never said you
should go to law school.

52:11.709 --> 52:15.709
- Fuck you, 'cause you
sure didn't stop me.

52:15.709 --> 52:16.959
- What?

52:16.959 --> 52:21.542
- But I'm okay with it, our
life, what we have together.

52:23.208 --> 52:26.625
You just don't appreciate
what is right in front of you.

52:26.625 --> 52:28.083
Maybe it's too normal for you.

52:28.083 --> 52:28.834
Maybe I'm too normal for you.

52:28.834 --> 52:31.208
- That's not true.

52:31.208 --> 52:32.625
You're my rock.

52:32.625 --> 52:36.750
- I'm sorry for what I
did, and it was only once,

52:37.792 --> 52:41.875
but I don't want to be a
rock, 'cause it's boring.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.834
- Do you mind getting a cab?

53:00.959 --> 53:02.834
I was gonna tell you.

53:02.834 --> 53:04.125
- Were you gonna invite me?

53:04.125 --> 53:05.125
- It's just this
little side project.

53:05.125 --> 53:06.583
- Hmm, yeah, you told
me you were working

53:06.583 --> 53:10.125
on a play about the downtown
theater scene in the 1990s,

53:10.125 --> 53:12.834
but you never said anything
about a character who--

53:12.834 --> 53:15.041
- It's not you.

53:16.500 --> 53:17.959
It's not, it's not you.

53:17.959 --> 53:18.959
- Bullshit!

53:20.583 --> 53:23.500
Sarah Marks, character that's
a dark-haired, Jewish girl

53:23.500 --> 53:28.291
from Connecticut who's intense
and neurotic and suicidal.

53:28.291 --> 53:29.625
- It's not you.

53:29.625 --> 53:30.458
It's not just you.

53:30.458 --> 53:30.917
It's all of us.

53:33.083 --> 53:34.500
Could you maybe see
it as a compliment?

53:34.500 --> 53:34.834
- A compliment?

53:34.834 --> 53:36.625
Of what?

53:36.625 --> 53:38.375
- You inspire me.

53:38.375 --> 53:39.959
- No, I don't.

53:39.959 --> 53:42.667
- Could you guys
maybe not do this right now?

53:42.667 --> 53:43.542
Could you?
- I'm sorry.

53:43.542 --> 53:45.417
I'm sorry.

53:45.417 --> 53:48.417
I'm sorry, I'm just
gonna get her a cab.

53:51.083 --> 53:54.333
- I'm not her fucking aunt,
and she had four cookies.

54:18.250 --> 54:19.250
Hi, Leslie.

54:21.166 --> 54:24.917
Well, I came home
for the weekend.

54:26.291 --> 54:28.834
No, not Connecticut, New York.

54:31.709 --> 54:35.250
I don't know,
Wednesday, probably.

54:35.250 --> 54:37.208
No, Leslie, I am fine.

54:38.750 --> 54:40.417
I just need a minute to myself.

54:44.667 --> 54:47.041
I can't.

54:47.041 --> 54:49.625
I can't really talk
about it right now, okay.

54:49.625 --> 54:50.458
Yup, I will be there.

54:53.875 --> 54:54.750
Yup, bye.

55:40.792 --> 55:41.667
- Coming?

55:47.000 --> 55:48.625
- Okay.

56:37.834 --> 56:40.875
Hey, do you know where Kate is?

56:40.875 --> 56:42.166
I was supposed to meet her here.

56:42.166 --> 56:43.542
- Uh, I don't.

56:43.542 --> 56:45.250
She is usually here.

56:47.542 --> 56:47.917
It's Anna, right?

56:47.917 --> 56:50.208
- Yeah.

56:50.208 --> 56:52.458
- Yeah, Sam, I'm in
teacher training with Kate.

56:52.458 --> 56:53.333
- Oh cool.

56:54.667 --> 56:57.208
Well, thank you
for encouraging me.

56:57.208 --> 56:58.375
I'm glad I stayed.

56:58.375 --> 57:01.667
- Yeah, maybe we
will see you again.

57:01.667 --> 57:05.166
- Oh probably not, I have
to head back to work.

57:05.166 --> 57:06.583
- What do you do?

57:08.750 --> 57:10.333
Oh, no, no worries.

57:11.834 --> 57:13.583
- I'm a forensic anthropologist.

57:15.583 --> 57:16.417
- Wow.

57:18.041 --> 57:20.166
Well, that's
extremely interesting.

57:21.750 --> 57:22.375
So where you headed?

57:22.375 --> 57:25.375
- Syria, if I can get in.

57:25.375 --> 57:26.583
What do you do?

57:27.792 --> 57:30.834
- I have a small
contracting company.

57:30.834 --> 57:34.250
Nothing fancy, we
mostly do green roofs.

57:35.542 --> 57:35.709
It's strange.

57:37.458 --> 57:39.667
I mean, Kate's always here, so.

57:39.667 --> 57:42.959
- Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
go find her at her house.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.625
- I hope she's okay.

57:44.625 --> 57:45.417
- Thanks.

57:45.417 --> 57:45.709
- Let me know.

57:48.417 --> 57:52.875
- Does she
have your number?

57:52.875 --> 57:54.083
- Probably not.

58:01.166 --> 58:03.750
- They can just kick you
out without any warning?

58:03.750 --> 58:06.709
- I've been in housing
court all month.

58:06.709 --> 58:08.792
Didn't know it was
gonna happen so fast.

58:08.792 --> 58:10.875
- You have to get
everything out today?

58:10.875 --> 58:12.625
- They're gonna
lock me out at 11,

58:12.625 --> 58:15.125
and I have to arrange to
get the rest of my stuff

58:15.125 --> 58:16.834
at the landlord's convenience.

58:16.834 --> 58:18.959
- Oh okay, how can I help?

58:19.667 --> 58:23.166
- Those books can go in there.

58:23.166 --> 58:24.834
- You can fight this.

58:24.834 --> 58:26.792
- I can't
afford the legal fees.

58:26.792 --> 58:27.500
I can barely afford the rent.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.834
- Take my apartment.

58:30.834 --> 58:31.583
- I don't want your apartment.

58:31.583 --> 58:34.041
- Well, where are you gonna go?

58:34.041 --> 58:36.250
- I don't know,
Upstate probably.

58:36.250 --> 58:38.792
I'm priced out.

58:38.792 --> 58:40.875
- I can lend you some money.

58:40.875 --> 58:43.250
- I don't need a bailout.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.834
- Why won't you let me help you?

58:44.834 --> 58:49.875
- I don't need you to save me
or solve me or do anything.

58:52.875 --> 58:54.208
- You'll never
forgive me, will you?

58:54.208 --> 58:56.792
- Of fuck you,
you fuckin' left me!

59:01.625 --> 59:06.083
- Yeah, I left in the
middle of our show,

59:06.083 --> 59:07.250
and it was fucked up.

59:07.250 --> 59:10.125
But I was broke.

59:10.125 --> 59:11.875
I was scared.

59:11.875 --> 59:15.542
And I didn't know I was gonna
stay out there for that long.

59:15.542 --> 59:17.083
So yes, I am a sellout.

59:17.083 --> 59:19.041
I'm pathetic.

59:22.250 --> 59:23.125
You, Kate,

59:24.625 --> 59:25.875
you were hard.

59:25.875 --> 59:27.125
I didn't know who
you were gonna be

59:27.125 --> 59:28.792
from day-to-day,
from night-to-night.

59:28.792 --> 59:30.208
- Guys, just please.

59:30.208 --> 59:32.041
- Did I ever miss a show?

59:32.041 --> 59:32.875
- No.

59:32.875 --> 59:36.041
- Did I ever fuck up on stage?

59:43.959 --> 59:45.041
Yeah, you wanted to leave.

59:45.041 --> 59:47.291
Our show was always just
a stepping stone for you.

59:47.291 --> 59:49.667
- That is not true.

59:49.667 --> 59:50.875
- It was about you.

59:50.875 --> 59:52.250
- Kate!

59:52.250 --> 59:54.750
- To be honest, I don't
have time for you right now.

59:54.750 --> 59:55.917
- Enough.

59:55.917 --> 59:56.583
- And I don't need a
fucking intervention.

59:56.583 --> 59:58.875
- All right, you know what?

59:58.875 --> 01:00:00.291
For what it's worth, she
didn't just fly into town

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:02.583
and fly out afterwards.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:04.083
She's the one who
made it happen.

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:05.458
She got us all together--

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.583
- Isaac.

01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:07.166
- When none of us had
the balls to do it.

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:08.792
No!

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:12.917
And then she stayed in some
shitty motel for several weeks

01:00:12.917 --> 01:00:14.250
to make sure you were okay.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.834
Actually, to make sure
that you were not dead.

01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:20.875
So enough, both of you,
just give it a rest.

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:23.625
- Why are you telling me
this right now of all times?

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:24.959
- It's not really
yours to tell at all,

01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:28.625
but that doesn't seem
to stop you, does it?

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.792
- Did you know about his script?

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.667
Oh my God.

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:41.834
You helped him write
it, didn't you?

01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:47.125
- She didn't write anything.
- I helped a little.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:48.000
- Yeah.

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.917
You helped.

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:12.750
- Anna!

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:14.625
Anna!

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:15.959
Anna!

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.166
Come on!

01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:21.667
- You think I'm gonna let
you put this in the world.

01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:23.709
You can't take my life.

01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:26.959
- It wasn't intentional.

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:28.333
I was so in it.

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.208
It just kept coming out.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.083
And people were responding.

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:36.250
It's been years since anyone
gave a shit about my work.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:40.500
You have no idea what a complete
train wreck my career's in.

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:42.375
- What you wrote--

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:44.166
- What?

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:45.834
- She's selfish.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.291
She's self-absorbed.

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:48.291
She's manipulative.

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.709
She's needy as hell.

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:53.166
- Yeah, and loving
and intense and smart

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:59.041
and so full of pain that it
breaks my heart sometimes.

01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:07.041
- What happened with us?

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.917
You know what I'm talking about.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.208
- I was a mess.

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:20.542
- We were all a mess.

01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:23.041
- It was just so complicated.

01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:36.083
If I would've come any closer,

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:39.208
you would've been out the door,

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.333
just like now.

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:24.583
- Think there's room for this?

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:25.458
- Yeah.

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:34.709
- Wait, just
pull it up first.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:37.834
Up, lift up, and now pull.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:45.875
What are you doing?
- Thank you.

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:46.792
- No, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:47.709
- This is for the storage space.

01:03:47.709 --> 01:03:48.583
- Don't worry about it.

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:49.458
I got it.

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.542
What time's your train?

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:55.917
- I was gonna try
and get it 10 past 10.

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.583
- I could drive you
to Grand Central.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.166
- Nah, the traffic.

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:04.709
And I was gonna try and get
some things to bring Upstate.

01:04:06.667 --> 01:04:09.417
- You'll be back
for my reading, right?

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:11.625
- I don't know.

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:17.792
- Come
here, ya old geezer.

01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:18.083
Get over here.

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:33.458
- It's a beautiful play.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:04:59.375
- I only have one glass.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:00.208
- Oh.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.375
Hurricane Sandy?

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:31.083
- Uh, yeah.

01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:41.709
- Probably wouldn't
be that hard to fix.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.125
- I really need to
be here tonight.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:56.500
I've been thinking about when
I first came in these rooms,

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:02.250
I was like a spoiled,
little child.

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:07.333
I couldn't cook sober.

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:12.458
I couldn't pay my bills sober.

01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:16.917
I couldn't hold
on to a job sober.

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.542
I couldn't act sober.

01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:22.375
I couldn't love sober.

01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:29.582
It's like you're
so fully attached

01:08:30.082 --> 01:08:31.917
to this idea of yourself

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:34.250
that you can't find another way,

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:40.207
can't find yourself
without the drink.

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:52.917
I , I didn't
know how to ask for help.

01:08:54.417 --> 01:08:57.875
But there was someone in my life

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:00.959
who took care of everything

01:09:00.959 --> 01:09:05.082
for me without
asking for ,

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:11.207
for anything in return.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:16.000
I've resented her
for it ever since.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.625
I felt so beholden.

01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:21.250
I hated her for helping me.

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:31.207
Thank you for letting
me share.

01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:35.291
- We can add this.

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:36.667
Who's this?

01:09:39.834 --> 01:09:43.166
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:46.542
- We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:50.166
- That all men, that all men.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:52.792
All right, I got it, I got it.

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.959
Please.

01:09:54.959 --> 01:09:55.583
- You can't turn it
around like that.

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.959
You can't turn it around.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.750
- I was really sick last year.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.375
- Yeah?

01:10:10.417 --> 01:10:13.417
- I had this weird
autoimmune thing.

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:16.834
It's not contagious.

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:25.792
I started to see strange
lesions on my back.

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:30.375
Then it spread to my
mouth, my throat, my lungs.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:36.542
I couldn't talk.

01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:39.834
I almost lost my job.

01:10:45.834 --> 01:10:47.250
- You okay now?

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:49.291
- Mm hmm.

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:57.250
- Good.

01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:27.917
Sorry, I forgot I have to
be on the site this morning.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.625
- Oh, cool.

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:54.500
- I can come back later
today to fix your door.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.792
- Oh no, we can call
the landlord about that.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:11:59.417
- We?

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:03.709
- My assistant,
sometime assistant,

01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:05.959
she helps with stuff, research.

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:06.750
- Cool.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.959
- Yeah.

01:12:08.959 --> 01:12:12.375
- So are you around
for a few more days?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.417
- Yeah, I think I am.

01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:16.291
- Yeah.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:17.667
Okay.

01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:20.667
Well, you have my number.

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:23.458
- Mm hmm.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.667
- Or you can have
your people call--

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:30.000
- My people
will call you.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.458
- Oh, hey, what's up?

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:33.500
- Hi.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.333
- How ya doing?

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.166
- It's Sam.

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:36.083
- Isaac.

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.041
- Nice to meet you.

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:39.208
- This is an old friend.

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.625
- So I'll see you.

01:12:43.917 --> 01:12:44.375
- I'll see you later.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:46.792
- Yes, great.

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:47.500
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.208
- It's good meeting you.

01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:50.500
- You too.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:52.875
- Who was that?

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:58.709
- What are
you doing here?

01:12:58.709 --> 01:13:02.208
- Kate said you said
something about quitting.

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:04.166
But if this is your
not working plan,

01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:05.834
I don't think it's gonna work.

01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:10.083
- You know, I was actually
feeling good for a minute.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.000
What do you want?

01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:15.291
- I, uh,

01:13:18.542 --> 01:13:19.959
I need your help.

01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:24.709
I'm gonna beg you to please,
please, just hear me out, okay.

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:29.250
Jill just got a pilot and has
to leave for LA immediately.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:32.542
Is there any way that you
would consider coming out

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:36.375
of early retirement,
just to do the reading?

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:40.542
- So you're really
worried about me, huh?

01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:42.000
- Yeah, actually I am.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.959
- You have an unbelievable
amount of nerve.

01:13:44.959 --> 01:13:45.583
- You know, it's a
really good part.

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:48.083
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:50.750
- And maybe it'll help
find your way back.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.583
And I'm not gonna
lie, you're, you're--

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:53.333
- My attachment.

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:54.583
- Well, not attachment.

01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:57.917
- You weren't gonna
say attachment?

01:13:57.917 --> 01:14:00.709
- Anna, I'm fucking
hanging on a thread here.

01:14:02.959 --> 01:14:04.667
Please.

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.250
- Mm mm, no I don't
want to play her.

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:10.250
I don't want to play a part.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:13.041
I don't want to play any, mm mm.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.083
No.

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:17.750
- Okay.

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:22.750
Um,

01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:30.208
I just wanted to say
about that other night--

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:31.083
- Just...

♪ Oh baby

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:56.458

I'm sorry, but I can't
get together tonight.

01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:13.041
I don't want to sound
like a jerk here,

01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:15.458
but I know who you are, Anna.

01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:18.875
I mean, I'm sure you
had your reasons,

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:22.041
but I really wish
you'd, I don't know.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.542
It just seems like you've got

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:27.125
some unfinished business,
you know, stuff.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:30.208
Anyway, I just got out of
something really complicated,

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:34.041
and I'm trying not to.

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:37.667
It was an amazing night.

01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:40.750
And I'll check out your show.

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:42.792
- Hey.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.333
I wouldn't call this phone tag,

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:46.166
because you're not
returning my phone calls.

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:52.000
But I did make a call to Don
and Ruby and the entire team,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.834
and bottom line is you
are contractually bound

01:17:57.667 --> 01:18:00.166
for the next five years.

01:18:00.166 --> 01:18:03.875
That can mean no work
for you for the duration

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:09.208
of the contract, no
films, no commercials,

01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:14.709
no television shows, no
theater, no readings.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:20.458
What are you gonna do
with yourself, huh?

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:23.417
What if you get sick again?

01:18:23.417 --> 01:18:26.000
This is career suicide.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.834
You will not get another
chance for a long--

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:44.041
- It was called The
Blackout, El Apago.

01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:45.625
And I was playing a
guy who was trying

01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:48.041
to get home.
- Oh my God, Luis.

01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:49.375
- There she is!
- Hi.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:52.917
- Hey, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:53.375
Hey, these are
some of the actors.

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:55.083
This is Anna.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:55.875
- Hey.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:56.917
- Pleasure to meet you, big fan.

01:18:56.917 --> 01:18:58.166
- Thank you.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.000
- Anna, it's been
such a long time.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.500
- Oh I know, it has.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.250
- Thank you so much for
saving us at the last minute.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:04.709
- Of course.

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:06.333
- Okay, let's
get started, everybody.

01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:07.959
- You're sitting next to Flaco.

01:19:12.375 --> 01:19:13.250
- So thank you.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.750
Thanks to everyone
for being here.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.750
Let's just jump right in.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:20.041
- Life, Still
written by Isaac Jones,

01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:22.417
directed by Suzanne Boudreau,

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:24.041
lights up on East
Village Street,

01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:27.000
outside a scrappy
storefront under renovation.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Sarah Marks, 44, stands
looking at the building.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:39.625
- You try to hold on.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.875
But days get buried
under new ones.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.208
That rust-stained,
porcelain tub,

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.667
the kitchen
smelled like Turkish coffee

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:59.041
and her cheap lavender soap.

01:20:25.333 --> 01:20:27.125
It is like a drug, you know.

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:34.083
But the boundaries
start to blur.

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:37.041
Everything

01:20:40.834 --> 01:20:42.291
opens up, you know.

01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:46.041
You can see and feel things you
didn't even know were there.

01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:53.875
And when you can't feel it--

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.333
- You were perfect.

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.250
- It's not...

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:01.125
What?

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:02.291
- You felt that.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.792
How about that?

01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:09.000
- Yeah.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.792
- And this?

01:21:09.792 --> 01:21:10.667
- Mm hmm.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:16.000
Isaac.

01:21:57.709 --> 01:22:00.166
You need to go home.

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.125
- Hey, it's Sam.

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:27.959
I'm sorry, but I can't
get together tonight.

01:22:27.959 --> 01:22:30.834
I don't want to sound
like a jerk here, but,

01:22:30.834 --> 01:22:33.166
so I know who you are, Anna.

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:37.792
I mean, I'm sure you
had your reasons,

01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:41.000
but I really wish
you'd, I don't know.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:44.709
It just seems like you've got

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:48.333
some unfinished business,
you know, stuff, so.

01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:54.250
Anyway, I just got out
of something really--

01:23:46.667 --> 01:23:48.291
- Anna?

01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:05.458
- Okay.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.291
- You all right with it?

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:06.333
- Yeah.

01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:09.417
- Yeah?

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:10.166
- How long have you
been helping him?

01:24:10.166 --> 01:24:11.000
- Not long.

01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:16.667
- How many drafts has
he given you to read?

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:19.041
- 10, seriously, yeah.
- 10 drafts?

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:22.417
- You should've, the Kate
in the first one was...

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:25.375
- I'm so tired of pretending
to be other people.

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:27.041
And yet this is
supposed to be me,

01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:31.041
and something about it
just, like, I don't know.

01:24:34.542 --> 01:24:37.250
- Okay, fuck it,
fuck it, fuck it.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.375
And do this.

01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:42.291
- Okay.

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:45.583
- You're gonna
open up your chest,

01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:47.333
because remember, we're onstage.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:52.834
You need that voice.

01:24:52.834 --> 01:24:55.750
And you need that, well,
what do we always need?

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:57.917
We need that relaxation.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:24:59.750
You can hear the story.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:00.875
It's your story.

01:25:00.875 --> 01:25:03.417
You're in it.

01:25:03.417 --> 01:25:07.834
Just take them back, and
they're each separate things,

01:25:07.834 --> 01:25:10.583
and let's just take
our time to find them.

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:13.166
- The kitchen smelled
like Turkish coffee

01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:15.291
and her cheap lavender soap.

01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:16.417
I didn't like it, I'm sorry.

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:18.583
I didn't like lavender soap.

01:25:18.583 --> 01:25:19.583
- I loved it.

01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:23.709
- I want you to read
it, just one more time,

01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:24.333
just one more time.

01:25:27.083 --> 01:25:28.250
Just one more time,

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.333
I just want to hear
it out of your mouth.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.083
- That rust-stained,

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:36.625
that rust-stained porcelain tub,

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:40.125
remember we took a
bath together in it?

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.834
- I don't feel like I could've
done anything without you--

01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:43.792
- No, listen,

01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:46.750
you were a poet.

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:49.500
You were a poet
up there, onstage.

01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:05.417
Oh what the fuck!

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:12.041
- You were always
better than me.

01:26:47.041 --> 01:26:47.375
- I should go.

01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:50.291
I told Jude and...

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:04.041
- Promise me you'll be there.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:06.083
- Yeah, I'll be there.

01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:13.041
I can't go to
those places sober,

01:27:16.542 --> 01:27:17.417
but you can.

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:21.417
That's a gift.

01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:26.250
Don't be so cavalier about it.

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:01.583
- What do you think?

01:28:02.875 --> 01:28:05.667
- Too bluish.

01:28:05.667 --> 01:28:07.208
- Too bluish?

01:28:07.208 --> 01:28:09.417
- Blue, blue, blue, too bluish.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:13.166
- Maybe I'm feeling
a little blue.

01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:14.875
- I think you should
change the pants.

01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:15.667
- The pants?

01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:18.125
- Pants.

01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:19.125
- These are the pants you
got me for Father's Day.

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:22.834
All right, what do you
think if it's tucked in?

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:23.959
- Better.

01:28:23.959 --> 01:28:24.792
Better, right?
- All you need

01:28:24.792 --> 01:28:25.458
to do is have a tie.

01:29:10.208 --> 01:29:12.083
- I mean, are you
joking with me?

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.375
Are you okay?

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:15.458
Where are you?

01:29:17.667 --> 01:29:18.917
I really need you to do this.

01:29:18.917 --> 01:29:19.792
You know you can do it.

01:29:19.792 --> 01:29:20.542
You know it.

01:29:20.542 --> 01:29:21.333
You know her.

01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:23.166
- I'm sorry, I can't.

01:29:24.417 --> 01:29:28.709
- So why don't we
just call it off?

01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:32.625
- Thank you, thank you all
so much for being here.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:34.750
I apologize for the delay.

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:37.583
We are very pleased to
introduce Kate Mullen

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:42.542
who will replace Ann Baskin due

01:29:42.542 --> 01:29:43.750
to a last-minute
scheduling conflict.

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:47.625
You of course remember
Kate and her brilliant work

01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:50.333
with Anna and Isaac in
the Mercurial Theater.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.583
- Life Still, written
by Isaac Jones.

01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:05.208
Lights up on East Village Street

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:08.125
outside a scrappy
storefront under renovation,

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:09.542
the windows are papered over,

01:30:09.542 --> 01:30:12.125
and there are
construction permit signs.

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:16.125
Sarah Marks, 44, stands
looking at the building.

01:30:16.959 --> 01:30:19.500
- You try to hold
on, but days seem

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.709
to get buried under new ones.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:24.458
Was it 139th or 120?

01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:28.709
That rust-stained,

01:30:33.834 --> 01:30:35.333
that rust-stained,

01:30:39.917 --> 01:30:41.667
that rust-stained porcelain tub,

01:30:43.917 --> 01:30:45.250
the kitchen smelled
like Turkish coffee

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.583
and her cheap lavender soap.

01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:52.458
His bootleg scripts
for master plays,

01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:57.083
that grungy rehearsal
room on 48th,

01:30:57.083 --> 01:30:59.583
it was as if one's self
had been lifted away,

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:02.500
and there was
another underneath.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:04.667
I could do anything.

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.625
I could feel everything.

01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:16.083
But now I'm finding it harder
and harder to stay connected.

01:31:44.125 --> 01:31:46.041
- Kate.

01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:47.667
- Where the fuck have you been?

01:31:55.542 --> 01:31:55.750
- Here he is.

01:31:58.583 --> 01:31:59.375
Thank you.

01:32:25.458 --> 01:32:27.375
- You sure about this?

01:32:32.417 --> 01:32:35.625
- Thank you for everything.

01:32:41.542 --> 01:32:44.417
- I was thinking about
stopping by the set tomorrow,

01:32:44.417 --> 01:32:47.000
just watch the scene.

01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:49.333
- I'd like that.

01:32:55.291 --> 01:32:57.166
Your boy graduate?

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:57.583
- Barely.

01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:13.959
- So the last tenant
was here a long time.
