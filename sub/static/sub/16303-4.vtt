know where to begin.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.220

He's still off the grid.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.127
* Niggas know I'm bringing
back the rumble in here *

09:54.127 --> 09:55.696
* Just when you thought
you could cool down *

09:55.696 --> 09:56.797
* and sip some of that water *

09:56.797 --> 10:01.268
- [silence]

10:01.268 --> 10:02.569
- Well, fuck.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.771
- [music] * Feel right in

10:03.771 --> 10:05.038
* Feel good in this
motherfucker *

10:05.038 --> 10:08.441
* My whole hood in

10:08.441 --> 10:10.277

10:10.277 --> 10:12.445

10:12.445 --> 10:14.782
* Feel good in this

10:19.319 --> 10:21.254

10:21.254 --> 10:23.323
* Feel good in this
motherfucker *

10:23.323 --> 10:25.726

* And we gon' rock

10:30.197 --> 10:32.332
* And we gon' rock
this motherfucker *

10:33.867 --> 10:35.468
- SINGER: Ladies and gentlemen,
one more time

10:35.468 --> 10:37.470
Put your hands together
for Mystikal

10:37.470 --> 10:38.939
[clapping]

10:38.939 --> 10:40.073
Don't it feel good?

10:40.073 --> 10:42.843
Ain't he making us
feel good tonight?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.178
- Alright.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.880
I think he is...

10:46.880 --> 10:48.816
good to go.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.917
Let's do it.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.018
- Ready when you are.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.786
- Hannah, can I get
you anything?

10:52.786 --> 10:53.854
Bottled water?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.288
- Uh, I think we're good,
Sammy boy.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.957
Unless I can get a smile?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.226
- [giggles] He's kidding.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.627
- Ok.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.495
- Oh hey, Larry, remember this
guy wants to kill Jar Jar

11:02.495 --> 11:03.831
with an actual knife.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.899
Not a light saber.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.067
So let's cue up those Saving
Private Ryan files we've got.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.903
- (Yoda voice) Mmm, cue it up
I will.

11:09.903 --> 11:10.904
- No more of that.

11:10.904 --> 11:11.839
- [knocking]

11:11.839 --> 11:13.774
- Hello?

11:13.774 --> 11:14.507
- Dean Samuelson.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.909
What a... surprise.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.311
- Yeah, I just thought I'd
drop by and say, you know,

11:18.311 --> 11:20.313
thank you for getting
me that check.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.783
I know I was a little harsh
earlier, about threatening

11:22.783 --> 11:25.518
to take away your scholarship,
but uh...

11:25.518 --> 11:26.519
that's not me.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.487
That's not us.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.889
That's not what we have.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.760
And I just wanted to say,
you know, we're good, alright?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.660
Let's let, uh...

11:33.660 --> 11:34.995
Let's let bygones be bygones.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.529
- Uh...

11:36.529 --> 11:37.831
That's great, thank you.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.701
- [Dean laughs]

11:42.502 --> 11:44.704
- Yeah...

11:47.440 --> 11:48.541
What's all this?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.343
- Uh, doing lab experiments.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.845
- Yeah, that's bullshit,
alright?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.882
I want to know exactly what is
going on down here, alright?

11:54.882 --> 11:58.451
Saw some flier earlier about
living out your dreams.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.553
I think you little chuckle
fucks are up to something.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.789
I want to know what this is.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.523
I want to know what's
going on over here.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.157
What is this?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.492
Fears? Stress?

12:05.492 --> 12:06.994
Dick fingers- I don't like
the sound of that one.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.129
- [bang]

12:11.298 --> 12:13.967
- Larry...

12:13.967 --> 12:15.936
Cancel the sequence.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.508
- [plate sliding, hatch shuts]

12:28.481 --> 12:31.118
[slurpy sound]

12:31.985 --> 12:33.753
- Fuck you!

12:36.990 --> 12:37.724
Let me out!

12:37.724 --> 12:38.992
- He's gonna crack.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.493
- He already has.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.394
I'm going in.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.529
- Wait.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.463
- SAM: What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.498
- Let him stew a little longer.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.800
- We need answers now.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.535
If this thing gets out,
we'll be up shit creek

12:48.535 --> 12:49.937
with our dicks in our hands.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.505
- I said hold off.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.444
- SAM: God damn it!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.879
God damn it!

12:58.879 --> 13:00.347
Fuck!

13:00.347 --> 13:01.214
- Sam!

13:01.214 --> 13:02.682
What the fuck were you thinking?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.852
- I didn't like where his line
of questioning was headed.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.053
- So you bludgeoned him?

13:06.053 --> 13:07.520
- A justified bludgeoning.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.856
- What?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.924
- Guys, what we're doing in
here is some serious

13:10.924 --> 13:12.492
fringe science.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.963
Highly illegal mad
laboratory shit.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.031
He could take all of that
away from us, or worse.

13:18.031 --> 13:18.631
- Tell my dad.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.632
- No.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.767
He could send us to jail.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.336
- Oh fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.337
Oh...

13:24.337 --> 13:26.874
- Calm down, Sam.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.608
- What do we do with him?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.978
- We put him in an Uber,
we tell the driver he had

13:30.978 --> 13:32.479
too much to drink.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.713
- No.

13:33.713 --> 13:34.982
We strip him naked and
then we drop him off

13:34.982 --> 13:36.616
at the front steps of
an elementary school.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.918
- No.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.718
When he comes to, he could
remember everything.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.889
We can't take the risk.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.992
- Why don't we hook him up
to the machine?

13:44.992 --> 13:48.061
- What did you say?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.562
- Everyone's got demons.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.663
You know?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.400
I'm sure Dean Samuelson's
got plenty.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.167
- Blackmail.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.368
- Justified blackmail.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.071
- Yeah. Right.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.940
- It's our only shot.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.843
- Here we go.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.445
- It's normal not to
remember any of it.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.947
Thank you!

14:06.947 --> 14:08.381
- You sure about this, boss?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.083
- No, I'm not sure about it,
but Sam and I can't go in.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.384
He knows us.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.586
And we need a third man
to keep the dream stable.

14:14.521 --> 14:18.091
- Thank you for
believing in me.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.561
- It's only because there's
literally no one else.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.464
- I won't let you down.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.565
- Okay, guys.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.099
I'm sending you directly
into his head.

14:26.099 --> 14:26.766
- What?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.168
No Brain Frame?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.237
- No, we're not prepped for it,
we don't have time.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.804
He could wake up any second.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.941
So just go in there, get what
you need, and get the hell out.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.943
- Stealth mission.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.277
Copy that.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.545
- Also, we didn't have time
for a dream history,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.014
so I have no idea what
I'm sending you into.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.950
Could be an orgy,
could be a nightmare.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.117
- Well, I've been to a
few orgies that were

14:44.117 --> 14:45.652
total nightmares.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.087
You gotta have snacks.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.721
- Hannah, just be careful, okay?

14:48.721 --> 14:49.622
- We got it, Sam.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.124
Thank you.

14:51.424 --> 14:51.959
- Connor?

14:51.959 --> 14:53.593
- Yeah?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.595
- If I don't make it...

14:55.595 --> 14:58.198
Take care of Mr. Peanuts.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.001
- Of course, he won't
feel a thing.

15:01.001 --> 15:01.901
Hit it Sam.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.203
- No, no! I was talking about-

15:06.206 --> 15:10.477
- [music]

15:10.477 --> 15:24.757
[footsteps]

15:24.757 --> 15:26.593
- Oh...

15:26.593 --> 15:29.029
- Larry...

15:29.029 --> 15:30.197
- What do I do?

15:30.197 --> 15:32.232
- Go with it.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.633
- What's happening?

15:33.633 --> 15:34.467
Where are you?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.036
- HANNAH: We're in church.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.070
Looks Catholic.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.671
- CONNOR: Have you spotted
him yet?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.041
- BERKMAN: Not yet.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.742
Wait, I've got him.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.111
He's up front.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.778
- Well, what's he doing?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.114
- He's praying.

15:47.114 --> 15:51.251
He's literally dreaming about
praying in church.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.319
- Alright, hang in there.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.086
We'll see where
this is headed.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.023
- Thank Christ I'm a Jew.

15:56.023 --> 15:59.059
- I don't know if we're gonna
find any dirt on this guy.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.194
- Who the hell dreams
about sitting in church?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.695
- Shhh!

16:02.695 --> 16:04.031
- You shhh!

16:04.031 --> 16:05.098
You're not even real.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.066
- Page 430.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.734
From the hymnal.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.071
- Me?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.306
- CONNOR: What the hell
is going on?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.642
- Larry's part of the dream.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
And they want him to sing.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.612
- Tell him to sing, damn it!

16:19.612 --> 16:22.315
If the Dean senses something's
off, we'll never find anything.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.285
- Sing.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.253
- I can't sing.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.054
I can't sing.

16:27.054 --> 16:27.687
I-

16:27.687 --> 16:29.689
- Larry. Sing.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.291
- [clearing throat]

16:31.291 --> 16:38.165
- (terrible singing)
A---va Mari---i---a.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.599
- Guys.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.633
What's going on?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.170
- (terrible singing)
A----va...

16:43.170 --> 16:44.537
A----va.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.174
- Other than Larry butchering
a classic, not much.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.143
- (terrible singing)
Maria---...

16:50.143 --> 16:51.311
- No, no, no, no!

16:51.311 --> 16:52.679
I'm reading a new REM cycle.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.446
- Wait.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.148
Where did the Dean go?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.284
- (terrible singing)
Maria----.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.551
- He's going out the back door.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.353
Let's go.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.723
- (terrible singing)
Mari---a.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.857
Where are you guys going?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.161
(terrible singing)
Ay--- Macare---na.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.667
- BERMAN: Where are we?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.269
- HANNAH: Looks like
the college.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.837
- CONNOR: Do you have eyes
on him?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.772
- HANNAH: I think we lost him.

17:19.772 --> 17:20.640
- Wait, is Larry with you?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.242
- No, we left him at the church.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.211
But he seemed really happy.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.413
- Shit, that dreams
about to end!

17:26.846 --> 17:32.152
- (terrible singing)
A---va Mari---...

17:32.152 --> 17:34.121
A...

17:34.121 --> 17:35.588
- Larry, get out of there!

17:35.588 --> 17:37.657
- (terrible singing)
Ava Maria.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.758
Guys what's happening?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.794
Ava Mari----!

17:41.794 --> 17:44.231
- [chaotic music]

17:44.231 --> 17:45.832
- [vomiting]

17:45.832 --> 17:47.634
- Guys, Larry's out.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.236
We don't have much longer,
you're losing stability.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.170
- Oh no!

17:50.170 --> 17:50.870
No!

17:50.870 --> 17:52.205
- It's alright!

17:52.205 --> 17:53.206
Hey, you're okay.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.374
You're okay.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.743
Oh, it smells really bad.

17:56.743 --> 18:01.181
- [moaning]

18:01.181 --> 18:02.649
- Hi.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.184
- HANNAH: Hey.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.785
I think I've got him.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.193
Connor, I think we have
something here.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.266
Where'd he go?

18:24.337 --> 18:25.705
- [vomiting]

18:25.705 --> 18:26.273
- Okay.

18:26.273 --> 18:26.939
It's okay.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.074
- I'm so sorry.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.809
I could have just stopped
the hymn and-

18:29.809 --> 18:31.178
[vomiting]

18:31.178 --> 18:32.078
- Oh god...

18:32.078 --> 18:32.879
- Damn it, he's too unstable.

18:32.879 --> 18:33.913
I'm gonna cut the plug.

18:33.913 --> 18:34.681
I'm shutting this down,
you guys.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.250
- Wait, wait, Connor.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.286
- I see him.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.221
- No, no, no, no!

18:41.221 --> 18:42.255
- What are you hiding?

18:42.255 --> 18:42.922
- Nothing.

18:42.922 --> 18:43.756
- What is this?

18:43.756 --> 18:44.757
- I'm not hiding anything.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.959
- M.W.?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.262
- He can't find out about this!

18:49.262 --> 18:50.930
I'll lose everything
I've worked for!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.565
Nooooooo!

18:53.300 --> 18:54.267
- HANNAH: Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna puke.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.868
- Why am I tied up?

18:55.868 --> 18:57.103
This is unacceptable!

18:57.103 --> 19:00.273
You two, stop puking
and fucking untie me!

19:00.273 --> 19:01.274
What the hell is-

19:01.274 --> 19:02.342
- [smack]

19:02.342 --> 19:03.410
- Damn it, Sam, stop
bludgeoning him!

19:03.410 --> 19:04.477
- Sorry.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.111
Did you guys find
anything in there?

19:05.111 --> 19:06.813
- No. Nothing.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.880
- Shit!

19:07.880 --> 19:09.316
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.283
What are we gonna do?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.718
- Wait, wait.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.221
He was like, shredding a bunch
of paper in his office.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.923
- But all of the papers had
an M and a W on them.

19:16.923 --> 19:17.724
- M.W.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.691
- M.W.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.692

19:19.692 --> 19:20.393
Mookie Wilson?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.229
- Michael Winslow?

19:22.229 --> 19:22.929
- Michelle Wodriquez?

19:22.929 --> 19:23.663
No...

19:23.663 --> 19:25.765
- Michelle Williams?

19:25.765 --> 19:26.699
- Michelle Williams?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.434
- Mark Wahlberg.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.001
- No, he's an angel.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.970
- Montgomery Wittington?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.205
- Your dad?

19:32.205 --> 19:34.006
- He knows the dean from
the university board.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.276
- He gives a lot of money
to the school.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.745
- There was a bear shoving
a bunch of cash into a bag.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.279
- [spitting up]

19:39.279 --> 19:40.913
- Bear?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.250
- You think he's stealing
from him?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.254
- Well, there's only one way
to find out.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.425
- [water splashing]

19:52.425 --> 19:53.893
- Oh!

19:55.862 --> 19:56.796

- HANNAH: Rise and shine, Dean.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.832
- Did you sleep well?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.401
- What have you done to me?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.370
- We saw what you
were shredding.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.604
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.374
- If my dad finds out
what you've done...

20:07.374 --> 20:10.377
Well, I think you know
what he's capable of.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.378
- I'm not scared of you.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.346
- Well, you should be.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.282
Because if Montgomery Wittington
hears what you've

20:15.282 --> 20:16.783
been doing...

20:16.783 --> 20:20.453
You will lose everything
you've worked for.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.324
- [bottles clinking]

20:24.324 --> 20:25.658
- I cannot believe
that worked.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.926
- We totally blackmailed a
high-ranking official.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.995
- I've been wanting to do
that for a long time.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.797
- Ha ha, alcohol makes me woozy.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.365
- I think you mean drunk.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.700
- No, woozy.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.035
I'm not supposed to be
drinking on my medication.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.837
- Party time!

20:37.837 --> 20:38.805
- Whoa, Larry.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.472
No, no, no.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.940
Larry, come on.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.045
- How you doing?

20:46.045 --> 20:46.779
- You know, just, uh,
celebrating all our

20:46.779 --> 20:49.416
illegal activities.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.350
- Kinda fun though, right?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.319
- Mhm.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.455
- Hey, I wanted to thank you.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.657
- For what?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.959
- Oh, I don't know...

20:59.959 --> 21:01.494
Kidnapping me.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.463
Invading my dreams.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.867
Introducing me to this...

21:07.867 --> 21:11.037
weird, crazy world
we've discovered.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.541
Seriously though?

21:14.541 --> 21:17.377
I'm having the
time of my life.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.013
In some strange way,
it's just...

21:21.013 --> 21:22.982
exactly what I needed.

21:22.982 --> 21:23.750
- Good.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.086
I'm glad I could help.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.422
- I know it's boring
for you sometimes.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.289
- Mmmmm...

21:30.289 --> 21:32.492
- But look at it this way...

21:32.492 --> 21:35.328
we're doing something that's
never been done before.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.931
- Yeah.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.099
- Okay.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.133
Party time, right?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.101
- Okay.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.202

Over half used the
