You're lost.

01:06.182 --> 01:10.685
I'm not lost.
I just don't know exactly where we are.

01:10.811 --> 01:13.355
Maybe I should steer for a while.

01:13.522 --> 01:15.816
Whoa. I'm a little buzzed.

01:15.982 --> 01:18.692
Man, you are so cute
when you're hammered.

01:18.818 --> 01:22.655
- I'm not hammered.
- You sure are.

01:28.201 --> 01:29.911
Hey, look.

01:30.036 --> 01:32.080
I'm busy here.

01:33.706 --> 01:35.750
Land.

01:59.729 --> 02:04.526
You see? We're not lost, we're just
on some creepy island penal colony.

02:04.693 --> 02:08.113
You know what?
I'm gonna go and find that bar.

02:08.238 --> 02:10.448
- Ok.
- Ok.

02:20.498 --> 02:22.792
Woof!

02:27.130 --> 02:29.174
Woof!

02:31.884 --> 02:36.013
Hey, wait up!
I've just gotta finish tying up here.

02:53.278 --> 02:55.322
Ow!

03:34.524 --> 03:36.234
Hello?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.697
Hello?

05:00.810 --> 05:02.437
Luke?

05:24.749 --> 05:26.209
Jenny?

05:31.963 --> 05:34.424
Jen?

05:58.404 --> 06:00.030
There it is.

06:00.155 --> 06:02.783
- What?
- There it is! You excited?

06:02.950 --> 06:07.913
Three final exams, two biology labs
and a term paper due in four days

06:08.080 --> 06:10.957
and I let you convince me to go
for a party weekend.

06:11.082 --> 06:13.376
It's my duty
as the irresponsible brother.

06:13.543 --> 06:15.837
To make sure I never get
into medical school?

06:16.003 --> 06:18.589
The burden of the smart guy!

06:18.714 --> 06:21.550
I got two words for you -
Communications Major.

06:21.675 --> 06:23.677
I'm a fan of the five-year program.

06:23.802 --> 06:26.513
This is why I had to study
in the library.

06:26.638 --> 06:31.267
Noah has turned our dorm room
into prime happy-hour real estate.

06:31.392 --> 06:36.021
Because I read the brochure that said
it's Ok to have fun in college.

06:36.147 --> 06:39.859
- I have fun!
- You have fun, when?

06:39.984 --> 06:43.361
Baby, you'll have the last laugh
when you're a doctor...

06:43.486 --> 06:47.866
and they're stuck living off of ramen
noodles and unemployment cheques.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.451
Oh!

06:49.576 --> 06:52.911
- That's not a bad thing.
- Bill Gates never went to college!

06:53.036 --> 06:55.122
Just fly the plane, Maverick.

Gosh, Mattie, this place is incredible.
I can't believe it's yours.

07:15.932 --> 07:17.726
Ours. It's "ours."

07:17.851 --> 07:22.104
God, it must really suck
being a trust-fund baby, huh?

07:22.229 --> 07:25.191
When my uncle died,
I only got Sonics season tickets.

07:25.316 --> 07:28.736
Our Uncle Frank wasn't rich.
This house was all he owned.

07:28.861 --> 07:31.322
- Lived here for... what?
- 20 years.

07:31.447 --> 07:36.284
...20 years, doing nothing but studying
birds, watching animals...

07:36.409 --> 07:39.245
Talking to trees, guzzling whisky.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.539
Yeah, he was a little eccentric.

07:42.581 --> 07:45.250
Johnny and our uncle
never really got each other.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.628
- No one ever gets me.
- I got you.

07:47.753 --> 07:50.881
You got me so much,
you dropped my ass.

07:56.219 --> 07:58.096
Hey...

07:58.221 --> 08:00.556
- Come on.
- Oh. Sorry, man.

08:15.319 --> 08:18.697
Overgrown chic! I love it.

08:18.823 --> 08:21.325
Come on, let's get inside.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.953
Man, I missed this place, Johnny.

08:24.078 --> 08:26.579
Ah, the zip line.
I'm going on that.

08:29.624 --> 08:32.626
Here we are.
Home sweet home, huh?

08:34.794 --> 08:36.630
- I love it!
- Wow!

08:36.755 --> 08:39.716
How long has it been
since you guys were here?

08:39.842 --> 08:43.761
God, ten... How old were you when
you sunk Uncle Frank's car in the bay?

08:43.886 --> 08:46.055
I was 12 and bored.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.308
12. So... 13 years.

08:49.434 --> 08:53.312
I'm surprised he left us the place.
He was afraid you'd burn it down.

08:53.438 --> 08:55.522
- I still can.
- Poor house.

08:55.647 --> 08:58.400
Check out the wine cellar.
Whoa!

08:58.525 --> 09:02.863
- An M5 Medoc? God, this is fancy!
- Yes, yes!

09:02.988 --> 09:06.198
In M5 I was still playing
with Rainbow Brite.

09:06.323 --> 09:09.910
Yeah? And looking good doing it.

09:10.035 --> 09:13.205
- We can't get into his wine, it's...
- What?

09:13.330 --> 09:16.291
It's... I don't know.
It's disrespectful or something.

09:16.416 --> 09:19.461
You know what? Let's all be quiet.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.796
Lucky for you guys I came prepared.

09:21.921 --> 09:24.674
- What you got?
- Anybody know what time it is?

09:24.799 --> 09:27.426
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

09:29.219 --> 09:30.804
Margarita-30!

09:37.769 --> 09:40.938
Where's the blender?
Come on, baby.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.196
Chips, salsa...

09:49.321 --> 09:52.115
hot dogs, beer...

09:55.911 --> 10:01.749
Soy milk? Flaxseed oil? Kasha?
What the hell is kasha?

10:01.874 --> 10:04.376
That's Nikki's. She's a health-food nut.

10:04.502 --> 10:07.046
Her body looks like no vegetarian
I've ever seen.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.297
Ooh!

10:09.964 --> 10:13.301
Have a good time.
Don't be a little vagina this weekend.

10:13.426 --> 10:18.764
Ok, that's offensive, A,
and B, I am gonna have a good time.

10:18.889 --> 10:22.810
- You still remember how to do this?
- Yes. Go.

10:28.315 --> 10:31.401
Ah, the memories.

10:31.526 --> 10:34.112
The car that was once a submarine.

10:35.863 --> 10:39.075
Give the nozzle a turn.
If you smell gas, run.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.742
Thank you.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.578
Hey, look. The keys are still in the car.

10:43.703 --> 10:47.582
That thing hasn't been used for ages.
It's never gonna start.

10:47.707 --> 10:51.210
Given your history,
it's probably a good thing.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.385
German engineering at its finest.

11:00.510 --> 11:03.430
Come on! Oh! Oh...

11:03.555 --> 11:06.266
What's wrong?

11:06.391 --> 11:10.145
The only thing separating me
from my immediate personal happiness

11:10.270 --> 11:12.646
is John and Matt's skill
with a generator.

11:12.771 --> 11:16.066
Then we'd better start drinking
these... before they go...

11:17.776 --> 11:20.987
Yes! That's what I'm talking about!
That's what...

11:22.947 --> 11:25.366
Why, blender?

11:25.491 --> 11:27.994
- What happened?
- What do we do?

11:30.997 --> 11:34.124
I saw the fuse box in the basement.

11:37.085 --> 11:41.214
- You know how to fix a fuse?
- Hell, no. You?

11:41.339 --> 11:43.799
- No!
- Well...

11:43.924 --> 11:45.885
maybe we could figure it out together.

11:51.057 --> 11:52.724
Ok, Ok...

11:52.849 --> 11:57.479
a young, handsome brother...

11:58.688 --> 12:02.983
...takes blonde little bad girl

12:03.108 --> 12:07.696
into the dark, dusty basement with him.

12:07.821 --> 12:10.282
- I got it.
- Ok, you go ahead.

12:10.407 --> 12:16.287
Young... attractive... virgin...

12:16.412 --> 12:21.042
pushes obnoxious
asshole in the basement!

12:26.922 --> 12:29.466
Are you really a virgin?

12:29.591 --> 12:33.637
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Er... yes.

12:41.685 --> 12:46.147
Ooh! Vintage.

13:01.995 --> 13:05.039
Here's the fuse box.

13:05.164 --> 13:07.250
- Look, there's the fuse.
- New one?

13:07.375 --> 13:10.169
Yeah... Oh. You see?
That one's blown.

13:10.294 --> 13:12.755
- This one?
- Yeah.

13:19.386 --> 13:21.096
- Sorry.
- Dude!

13:21.221 --> 13:23.932
It was this thing! I'm sorry!

13:24.057 --> 13:26.392
- You scared?
- No. Where is this?

13:26.517 --> 13:30.396
- Oh! Got it! Got the fuse.
- Yeah.

13:30.521 --> 13:33.274
- Should I put it in?
- Oh, God, yeah.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.025
Eugh!

13:36.193 --> 13:38.653
- Ok, here's the master switch.
- Ok, try it.

13:38.778 --> 13:40.989
- Ready?
- Yeah... Yes!

13:59.213 --> 14:03.301
- You weren't supposed to find that.
- Why?

14:03.426 --> 14:07.971
It's just a secret attic
for make-out parties.

14:09.681 --> 14:12.517
You were nine the last time
you came here, silly.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.353
And?

14:18.689 --> 14:21.192
I was a very early bloomer.

14:23.069 --> 14:27.740
If everybody knew the Matt that I know,
it'd be so hard to keep you to myself.

14:27.865 --> 14:29.949
No, it wouldn't.

14:34.412 --> 14:37.082
Which room should we take?

14:37.207 --> 14:39.500
The one farthest from my brother's?

14:39.625 --> 14:41.710
Ideal.

14:43.379 --> 14:46.215
Two years and it's still awkward.

14:48.675 --> 14:53.763
I apologised to him a thousand times
about us, but he's still mad.

14:53.888 --> 14:56.724
He's not mad, he's John.

14:59.935 --> 15:02.938
Are you trying to fulfil
some adolescent fantasies?

15:03.063 --> 15:05.524
I might be.

15:05.649 --> 15:08.068
Uh-uh. There.

15:08.193 --> 15:11.612
- A secret make-out party.
- Uh-oh.

15:12.905 --> 15:15.032
It's on!

15:20.662 --> 15:24.040
You know you're gonna kill
yourself.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.461
You'll never believe what I found
in the attic.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.130
Ah.

15:30.255 --> 15:35.426
Ah, the house flag.
We were such dorks.

15:35.551 --> 15:37.636
At least one of us has changed, huh?

15:37.761 --> 15:41.723
- That rope's gotta be 20 years old.
- It feels Ok to me.

15:41.848 --> 15:45.435
John, really.
Hemp like that deteriorates.

15:45.560 --> 15:51.232
I brought climbing rope with me.
You can string it with a Dynaloc.

15:51.357 --> 15:53.275
Whoo!

15:54.943 --> 15:59.031
- Once a brute, always a brute.
- Whoo!

16:04.076 --> 16:07.496
Sometimes it stuns me
that you two are related.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.085
Usually people who live
on the edge like that die young.

16:14.210 --> 16:16.963
Johnny wouldn't be caught dead dying.

16:17.088 --> 16:18.965
It would make him look bad.

16:43.446 --> 16:46.365
What? All work and no play.

16:46.490 --> 16:48.408
You sound like Johnny.

16:48.533 --> 16:51.495
Well, he wants you
to enjoy yourself too.

16:51.620 --> 16:54.121
- Right.
- He does.

16:55.206 --> 16:59.085
Remember when we were 13 and he
threw you your first boy-girl party?

16:59.210 --> 17:02.880
- When your mum went out of town?
- I do.

17:03.005 --> 17:05.382
And we played Truth or Dare

17:05.507 --> 17:09.010
and watched, er... What was that called?

17:09.135 --> 17:11.805
"Wild On lbiza"?

17:14.057 --> 17:16.724
- And he dared you to kiss me.
- And I did.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.727
Then I cried.

17:18.852 --> 17:21.980
I don't think my male ego
ever recovered from that.

17:23.816 --> 17:26.733
I think you're doing just fine.

17:27.984 --> 17:29.821
- You think?
- Yeah...

17:29.946 --> 17:32.740
Have fun, Ok?

17:35.701 --> 17:38.704
- Did you ever...
- No.

17:38.829 --> 17:42.499
We've been friends for a long time,
plus I got with too many of her girls.

17:42.624 --> 17:46.127
- Too many! What's too many?
- For a chick, any is...

17:46.252 --> 17:49.213
- Any is too many?
- Any is too many.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.427
Hi!

18:03.226 --> 18:07.021
Ok...

18:08.272 --> 18:10.357
Whoa!

18:18.239 --> 18:21.325
Nice shot, Robin Hood.
That's so white of you.

18:21.451 --> 18:23.911
- You wanna give it a shot?
- What?

18:24.037 --> 18:26.664
- Do you wanna try?
- Er... no.

18:26.789 --> 18:29.374
All right.

18:36.923 --> 18:39.050
See? It's that easy.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.594
You guys hear that?

18:44.055 --> 18:46.140
Oh, my God.

18:46.265 --> 18:48.433
It's so cute.

18:48.558 --> 18:50.226
Where is it from?

18:50.352 --> 18:53.355
- You better leave that thing alone.
- Can I see it?

18:57.400 --> 18:59.735
He just peed on you.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.863
It's a boy.

19:02.988 --> 19:06.825
- It can't be more than 8 or 9 weeks old.
- You go, Dr. Ruth.

19:06.950 --> 19:09.577
What kind of dog is that?

19:09.702 --> 19:14.624
Well, it looks like a German Shepherd,
but he's big. Really big.

19:14.749 --> 19:17.168
I thought we were the only ones
on the island.

19:17.293 --> 19:20.170
He was probably abandoned
by some boaters.

19:20.295 --> 19:23.006
Hey, guys, I have an idea. Hold on!

19:23.131 --> 19:26.009
Ssh! I have an idea, a good idea.

19:26.134 --> 19:28.929
- Let's eat him.
- You're such a dick.

19:29.054 --> 19:31.514
I'm serious.
We'll put him on the target...

19:37.103 --> 19:40.689
I got my iPod. Please, please.

19:45.443 --> 19:47.529
Here's to that!

19:47.654 --> 19:50.781
You like it here, huh?

19:50.906 --> 19:53.617
Let's keep him with us tonight,
you guys.

19:53.742 --> 19:56.704
You like it here?

19:56.829 --> 19:59.331
Wait, wait. No TV,

19:59.456 --> 20:01.874
no phone, no Maxim?

20:01.999 --> 20:04.502
Some people like a break
from civilisation.

20:04.627 --> 20:08.589
All right. Sure. I'm for the whole
kumbaya-granola thing,

20:08.715 --> 20:10.383
as long as when it's over,

20:10.508 --> 20:14.553
there's a fifth of Jager
and internet porn waiting for me.

20:14.678 --> 20:18.140
Noah, sometimes it amazes
me that you're still single.

20:18.265 --> 20:23.060
Here's to being single, seeing double,
sleeping triple...

20:23.185 --> 20:27.440
- ... and to multiple orgasms.
- Yeah, by yourself.

20:27.565 --> 20:29.650
Ooh!

20:32.318 --> 20:34.571
Oh!

20:37.824 --> 20:39.951
What's that in the cellar?
You hear that?

20:40.076 --> 20:44.580
- Is that an M5 Medoc calling me?
- Yes.

20:44.705 --> 20:48.375
You are gonna drink the cheap stuff
and you are gonna like it.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.129
You are a cruel, cruel man.
But I still love you.

21:00.345 --> 21:04.890
Uh-uh. That cute stuff's
not gonna work on me.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.142
I'm a cat person.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.861
Cheap enough?
That little sucker growled at me.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.238
You piss on that rug, you're dead.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.865
Hey!

21:25.200 --> 21:27.661
He was just kidding! Come back!

21:27.786 --> 21:29.412
Meanies.

21:29.537 --> 21:33.208
That dog is weird. He just growled at me
for no good reason.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.752
I said I liked cats.
I wasn't talking about the musical.

21:36.877 --> 21:39.338
This little dog is harmless.
Chicken.

21:39.463 --> 21:42.508
Don't worry, he'll come back.
He knows there's food here.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.301
You wanna find him?

21:44.426 --> 21:47.261
- I wanted to sleep with him.
- You were sleeping with me!

21:47.387 --> 21:50.264
She was gonna make love to me
and then sleep in your bed.

21:50.390 --> 21:51.849
That's Ok.

21:51.974 --> 21:55.894
I see cancer patients every Thursday.
That's my charity work for the week.

21:56.019 --> 21:59.523
Oh! Funny!

21:59.648 --> 22:02.192
The folks got jokes tonight.
You all want some?

22:09.448 --> 22:12.743
Here, pup. Where are you?

22:12.868 --> 22:15.538
- You see him?
- Uh-uh.

22:16.579 --> 22:18.665
This is bringing me back memories

22:18.790 --> 22:22.043
from Ghost in the Graveyard.
Remember? When we were ten?

22:22.168 --> 22:24.045
I don't remember that.

22:24.170 --> 22:29.383
- Yeah, you were too cool back then.
- I'm still too cool.

22:29.550 --> 22:31.927
- Right.
- Over there. There he is.

22:34.346 --> 22:38.433
Hey, pup, there you are.
There you are! Come here.

22:56.783 --> 22:58.701
Sara!

23:06.459 --> 23:08.752
You Ok?

23:10.879 --> 23:12.756
Here.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.467
Ok?

23:22.598 --> 23:25.142
It bit me.

23:25.309 --> 23:27.394
All right, you're Ok.

23:27.519 --> 23:30.605
You're Ok. Come on, let's go.

23:30.730 --> 23:32.690
It just attacked you, unprovoked?

23:32.815 --> 23:35.735
Yeah. Came out of nowhere.

23:36.903 --> 23:39.197
It was probably just protecting
its young

23:39.364 --> 23:44.076
but the rules say you gotta treat
any bite by an unknown animal

23:44.201 --> 23:46.995
as a possible rabies infection.

23:47.120 --> 23:51.624
But listen, you will not get rabies.
I know what I'm talking about.

23:51.749 --> 23:54.877
There isn't a single case
of somebody who's gone through

23:55.002 --> 23:58.839
a proper post-exposure treatment
who's then contracted the disease.

23:59.006 --> 24:02.676
Isn't that where they gotta stick
a bunch of needles under your skin?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.053
It's a little simpler than that.

24:05.178 --> 24:08.264
- A little simpler?
- I think we should get the plane ready.

24:08.431 --> 24:12.643
- You wanna leave?
- We should get Sara to a doctor.

24:12.768 --> 24:17.982
Remember when I got that rabies shot
cos of that bat in the Bahamas?

24:18.107 --> 24:20.484
You don't have to start right away.

24:20.609 --> 24:24.988
- You really don't, if you're feeling Ok.
- Is that true?

24:26.239 --> 24:29.659
As long as you have your first shot
within a week, yes.

24:29.826 --> 24:32.911
But... there's no pressure.

24:33.036 --> 24:36.206
Well, then I'm cool.
I'll be fine, you guys.

24:36.331 --> 24:37.833
- She's fine.
- Sara?

24:37.958 --> 24:42.420
Mattie, the point of this weekend
was for you to live a little,

24:42.586 --> 24:45.339
so don't use this as an excuse.
That's bullshit.

24:45.506 --> 24:49.802
Yeah, it's true, I'm fine. I mean, really.
It was scary!

24:49.969 --> 24:54.097
Nothing that a little drinking can't cure.

24:54.264 --> 24:57.684
Could someone give me a drink?
I need a drink.

24:57.809 --> 25:01.938
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

25:39.805 --> 25:42.975
What are you thinking about?

25:48.271 --> 25:51.858
There was this company
who leased some land

25:52.025 --> 25:55.736
on the other side of the island,
a couple of miles away.

25:55.903 --> 26:00.866
Anyway, they built a compound
for training dogs.

26:01.033 --> 26:04.536
When I was little, my uncle
used to walk me over there

26:04.703 --> 26:07.955
and we'd play with all
the little puppies.

26:08.122 --> 26:11.376
I think that's when I decided
I wanted to be a vet.

26:13.795 --> 26:15.837
About a year ago...

26:17.422 --> 26:20.509
...one of the dogs got rabies.

26:20.634 --> 26:24.763
It started spreading
and all the dogs got it,

26:24.930 --> 26:28.015
and my uncle told me
they had to put them down.

26:29.850 --> 26:32.937
- That's horrible.
- Mmm.

26:35.064 --> 26:38.274
So I assumed
they had been killed, but...

26:42.278 --> 26:45.031
...after seeing that dog today...

26:47.032 --> 26:50.577
So you think some of them survived?

26:50.744 --> 26:53.080
That's just it.

26:53.247 --> 26:57.375
If they had rabies and escaped, they
would've been dead a long time ago.

26:59.043 --> 27:02.338
In dogs, rabies is always fatal.

27:07.427 --> 27:09.469
So, what are you saying?

27:11.054 --> 27:13.098
I don't know.

27:38.621 --> 27:40.831
Oh!

27:40.998 --> 27:43.208
Sorry. I didn't see you.

27:43.375 --> 27:45.711
What are you doing?

27:45.878 --> 27:47.921
I couldn't sleep.

27:50.882 --> 27:53.760
- You?
- Me, neither.

27:56.554 --> 27:58.848
You look like an angel.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.502
Ow! Damn it!

28:31.627 --> 28:34.004
Easy, tiger.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.757
Go away.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.261
Go away.

29:16.042 --> 29:18.837
So, how about doing
some swimming today?

29:18.962 --> 29:21.840
Maybe hang out by the dock?

29:21.965 --> 29:24.258
Maybe when your leg feels better?

29:25.926 --> 29:27.678
I'm fine.

29:30.306 --> 29:32.975
How did I wind up dating
an outdoorsy type?

29:35.101 --> 29:38.938
I don't know. I think it's
a lot better than living in a library.

29:39.063 --> 29:43.609
I'm outdoorsy as long as
beautiful women in thongs are involved.

29:43.734 --> 29:47.446
Do you ever get tired
of making an ass of yourself?

29:47.571 --> 29:50.490
Not really. I figure
it's a part of my charm.

29:51.742 --> 29:54.910
Yo. Excuse me.

29:55.036 --> 29:57.079
I'm still hungry.

29:58.205 --> 30:00.708
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll make more.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.002
No, that's cool.

30:04.794 --> 30:07.297
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

30:08.465 --> 30:10.550
Boys and their toys.

30:10.675 --> 30:14.095
I thought I'd take a walk in the woods
and find something to shoot.

30:14.220 --> 30:16.221
I hope you mean something inanimate.

30:16.347 --> 30:20.267
- Gosh, no, I thought I'd hunt for Bambi.
- Just checking.

30:20.392 --> 30:24.605
I'm gonna come with you. I haven't
been around the island for years.

30:24.730 --> 30:27.357
- You guys wanna come?
- Noah, come on.

30:27.482 --> 30:30.360
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

30:30.485 --> 30:33.488
Enjoy your breakfast.

30:36.657 --> 30:40.410
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay here.

30:40.535 --> 30:43.080
I'm not keen on that dog running around.

30:43.205 --> 30:47.750
- Ok. We'll be careful.
- Keep him away from Thumper, too.

30:47.875 --> 30:49.961
Come on.

31:00.762 --> 31:04.057
No deer. No droppings.

31:08.727 --> 31:10.813
You hear anything?

31:12.314 --> 31:14.692
No.

31:14.817 --> 31:17.527
It makes you wonder
where all the animals are.

31:17.652 --> 31:20.905
Are you guys trying
to freak me out or something?

31:21.030 --> 31:24.993
Is this like a game you play?
What?

31:25.118 --> 31:28.453
- No, I'm serious.
- He's referring to inanimate animals.

31:31.206 --> 31:34.626
You think Sara is feeling Ok?

31:34.751 --> 31:37.212
I hope so.

31:37.337 --> 31:39.922
- She's looking pretty good these days.
- Don't.

31:40.047 --> 31:41.924
- What?
- Don't go there.

31:42.049 --> 31:43.926
Why not?

31:44.051 --> 31:48.014
She's obviously into me, so why
shouldn't I just go for it?

31:48.139 --> 31:50.515
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:51.599 --> 31:53.810
Because I've seen
how you treat women.

31:56.313 --> 31:58.398
Because you're good
at saving them

31:58.523 --> 32:01.317
doesn't always mean I'm the one
that ruins them.

32:03.611 --> 32:07.281
- Brother in love.
- It's all right, man.

32:07.948 --> 32:10.950
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yeah.

32:11.075 --> 32:13.161
Are you sure?

32:14.203 --> 32:16.289
I made out with John.

32:17.457 --> 32:21.418
- So that's what's bothering you?
- Kind of, yeah.

32:21.543 --> 32:23.462
- Why?
- Nice.

32:23.587 --> 32:28.634
I don't know. I guess I thought
the rabies was settling in.

32:28.759 --> 32:32.511
Very funny.
No, actually, I feel fine.

32:32.637 --> 32:36.974
I feel great. I've got like this
adrenaline inside.

32:37.099 --> 32:39.602
From John kissing you?

32:39.727 --> 32:41.811
- Maybe.
- Well, might as well.

32:41.937 --> 32:46.775
- You've liked him since you were 14.
- How did you know?

32:46.900 --> 32:49.736
Who doesn't know that?
Everybody knows.

32:49.861 --> 32:51.612
Oh, really?

32:51.737 --> 32:55.574
Ok, then I hate everybody
right now.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.164
Any day, Mcknight!

33:03.289 --> 33:05.541
Can a brother not get
some alone time?

33:05.667 --> 33:07.752
Damn!

33:38.571 --> 33:40.490
Nice doggy.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.285
Nice doggy.

33:47.579 --> 33:49.665
Good boy.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.793
Oh!

33:53.918 --> 33:58.965
Ok, Ok...
It's fine. It's fine.

34:03.136 --> 34:06.430
John! Matt! Hey!

34:15.353 --> 34:17.440
Oh! Oh!

34:19.650 --> 34:21.402
Oh!

34:21.527 --> 34:26.031
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

34:26.156 --> 34:29.242
The dogs on this island
are not friendly!

34:29.367 --> 34:31.911
- You afraid of a dog?
- No, dogs, man. Plural.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.623
- How many?
- Three, but it sounded like more.

34:36.748 --> 34:39.251
You hear that?

34:44.632 --> 34:46.716
You believe me now?

34:48.885 --> 34:51.471
Oh!

34:51.596 --> 34:54.724
They don't want you here.

34:54.849 --> 34:57.059
The dogs, they don't want you here.

35:06.484 --> 35:08.945
Help!

35:16.410 --> 35:17.953
- Get back!
- We gotta help him!

35:29.213 --> 35:31.423
What's up?

35:35.970 --> 35:37.428
Nothing.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.569
The house.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.739
- Hey!
- Go to the house.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.285
- What?
- Here they come.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.328
What?

36:04.912 --> 36:06.455
Run!

36:06.581 --> 36:08.999
- Run to the house!
- Oh, my God! Run!

36:09.124 --> 36:11.501
Run! Hurry up!

36:14.004 --> 36:18.008
Come on, you guys!
Hurry up!

36:20.050 --> 36:21.635
Hey!

36:23.887 --> 36:25.848
Mattie, no!

37:14.141 --> 37:16.435
This ought to be fun.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.652
- Argh! Argh!
- Damn!

37:25.777 --> 37:28.154
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

37:28.279 --> 37:30.949
God, I'm so sorry, Nikki.

37:33.659 --> 37:35.661
That's Ok.

37:38.121 --> 37:40.415
For all I know,
you could've saved my life.

37:40.540 --> 37:44.710
I don't know if I'm the life-saving kind.
I couldn't save that guy in the woods.

37:44.835 --> 37:48.381
- I thought we were the only ones here.
- He came out of nowhere.

37:48.506 --> 37:50.591
They ripped the shit out of him.

37:50.716 --> 37:53.051
I know! Death by dog is brutal!

37:53.176 --> 37:56.888
None of this makes sense!
There's no reason dogs could do this!

37:57.013 --> 37:59.474
These have the characteristics
of a rabid dog.

37:59.599 --> 38:03.519
- But if they had rabies, they'd be dead.
- Then what is it?

38:03.644 --> 38:07.356
- You know that dog compound?
- The seeing-eye dog facility, yeah.

38:07.481 --> 38:10.609
What if they were actually training
attack dogs, right?

38:10.734 --> 38:15.029
A year ago they shut the compound
down because of a rabies outbreak.

38:15.154 --> 38:19.659
So, attack dogs plus a weird strain
of rabies equals what?

38:19.784 --> 38:22.870
Scary-ass Lassies, that's what!

38:22.996 --> 38:25.289
- Relax.
- They don't want us here.

38:28.375 --> 38:31.044
That's what the dude in the woods said.

38:31.169 --> 38:33.297
- Twice.
- Who cares?

38:33.422 --> 38:36.966
We need to be focusing
on getting the hell outta here!

38:37.091 --> 38:40.720
I'm in serious need of some painkillers...

38:40.845 --> 38:43.514
and there's something wrong with Sara.

38:43.639 --> 38:46.099
You feel it, don't you?

38:46.224 --> 38:49.561
- Is something wrong with you?
- It comes and goes.

38:49.686 --> 38:52.397
We've gotta be smart here,
smarter than these dogs.

38:52.522 --> 38:57.693
Everybody just shut up! You're all
driving me crazy right now! Wild dogs?

38:57.818 --> 39:00.362
Nikki's right, we gotta get outta here!

39:00.487 --> 39:02.907
Sara needs help
and we're gonna do that!

39:03.032 --> 39:07.201
But first, we'll stay in here
where it's safe, let the dogs disperse,

39:07.327 --> 39:10.204
then get in the plane
and get the hell out...

39:43.735 --> 39:46.780
I don't wanna be here
any more.

39:48.948 --> 39:51.200
What do we do?

39:52.368 --> 39:54.662
We get outta here.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.709
Ready?

40:09.383 --> 40:11.885
The dogs are on the dock.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.598
It's like they know we wanna leave.

40:21.602 --> 40:23.479
You gotta be kidding me!

40:23.604 --> 40:25.773
What?

40:25.898 --> 40:29.484
- The plane's drifting away.
- It can't be. I tied it myself.

40:29.609 --> 40:31.695
Look, then.

40:33.071 --> 40:36.032
Shit. If it hits the channel,
it's lost.

40:36.157 --> 40:38.535
The dogs are gone.

40:40.411 --> 40:42.955
You guys, you guys...

40:43.080 --> 40:46.375
- I don't wanna go out there.
- You're going.

40:52.630 --> 40:55.633
You'll have to swim.
No one else can bring the plane back.

40:55.758 --> 40:58.469
- I know.
- Just give me this.

41:06.810 --> 41:11.022
For your brother being a screw-up,
he's stepping up and being a badass.

41:11.147 --> 41:15.234
I can't believe this.
They chewed through it on purpose.

41:15.359 --> 41:18.529
Listen, I don't know what the hell
is going on around here

41:18.654 --> 41:21.323
but dogs can't think like that.
They can't plan.

41:21.448 --> 41:25.744
If a dog chews through rope,
it's because dogs like chewing rope!

41:25.869 --> 41:27.704
Come on, John.

41:29.623 --> 41:31.874
He's almost there.

41:39.924 --> 41:41.925
Shit!

41:44.886 --> 41:47.931
- Come on, swim back, man!
- Swim!

41:48.056 --> 41:49.557
- The dogs!
- Hurry!

41:51.726 --> 41:56.021
- Stop looking back!
- Swim! Swim faster!

41:56.897 --> 41:59.441
You're fine!

42:12.370 --> 42:14.871
Bitch! Back to the house!
Come on!

42:14.996 --> 42:19.709
- Hurry up!
- Go! Go! Hurry up! Go!

42:19.834 --> 42:21.711
Run!

42:23.587 --> 42:25.965
Go! Go! Get inside!

42:27.967 --> 42:31.011
Come on, get up the stairs!

42:31.136 --> 42:33.347
Shut the door! Shut the door!

42:45.816 --> 42:48.777
But how did the dogs
even get on the plane?

42:48.902 --> 42:52.364
I once saw a dog balance
a marshmallow on his nose.

43:32.942 --> 43:35.028
Still no service.

43:35.862 --> 43:39.406
- You're running a fever.
- I am?

43:39.531 --> 43:43.994
Don't worry, it wouldn't be rabies yet.
It could be some other kind of infection.

43:44.119 --> 43:46.704
Great.

43:46.829 --> 43:49.373
All right, pros and cons.
What are the negatives?

43:49.498 --> 43:51.334
Negatives? Well, everything.

43:51.459 --> 43:54.003
It's dangerous just trying to get
to the garage.

43:54.128 --> 43:58.340
We don't know if the car will start
or what we'll find across the island.

43:58.465 --> 44:02.302
- Whatever got that guy here.
- With our luck, he parasailed in!

44:02.427 --> 44:06.181
The compound has gotta have
some kind of communications system.

44:06.348 --> 44:09.475
Hopefully it's not equipped
with some crazy Old Yellers.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.811
Look, we can't stay here.
We gotta get off this island.

44:15.856 --> 44:18.399
Ok. Ok?

44:18.524 --> 44:20.610
Ok, damn!

44:36.667 --> 44:38.918
All right, eeny...

44:39.043 --> 44:41.003
Meeny...

44:41.128 --> 44:43.756
Miney...

44:43.881 --> 44:45.550
I'll go.

44:57.143 --> 45:00.145
- lt'll lift right off.
- I don't want you to go.

45:00.271 --> 45:04.733
- I don't want anyone to go.
- I'll be fine. I'll be really quiet.

46:42.405 --> 46:44.907
How much do you weigh?

46:45.991 --> 46:49.662
You know how much I weigh, baby.
You're not doing this.

46:49.828 --> 46:53.665
Speed climbing champion three years
running. I weigh 120 pounds.

46:53.790 --> 46:55.917
I could do this with my hands tied.

46:56.084 --> 46:58.461
You were injured badly.

46:58.628 --> 47:00.838
I know my limits.

47:00.964 --> 47:03.091
This cable can't support you.

47:03.216 --> 47:07.094
I know what I'm talking about.
Think about it.

47:10.055 --> 47:12.432
I mean it. Think about it.

47:33.076 --> 47:36.996
- You didn't get any on the handles?
- No, you'll be fine.

47:50.341 --> 47:52.844
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

48:10.693 --> 48:13.362
You gotta be kidding me.

48:21.912 --> 48:23.788
They're here.

48:31.754 --> 48:33.881
Hurry, Nikki.

48:37.301 --> 48:39.886
Hey! Hey!

48:41.346 --> 48:43.806
Hey!

48:43.973 --> 48:46.809
Dogs! Dogs!

48:52.314 --> 48:56.151
Dogs! Dogs, over here! Come on!

49:37.313 --> 49:38.898
Come on!

49:44.069 --> 49:47.155
Come on! Piece of shit!

50:50.713 --> 50:55.342
- Hey! Are you Ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

50:56.510 --> 51:00.722
Just seems like it's gonna be dinnertime
over here soon.

51:00.847 --> 51:02.891
Hang on.
We got something worked out.

51:04.141 --> 51:06.227
Come on, guys!

51:06.352 --> 51:08.604
- Let's go!
- Yep!

51:09.522 --> 51:12.149
- Good?
- More slack! Watch yourself!

51:15.485 --> 51:19.364
- You didn't hit her this time!
- I'm gonna tie the line to the rope.

51:19.489 --> 51:21.491
- Pull it across.
- All right.

51:21.616 --> 51:23.701
Here it is!

51:26.537 --> 51:28.622
All right, pull it, pull it!

51:30.123 --> 51:32.376
Hurry!

51:37.797 --> 51:39.590
Come on.

51:50.600 --> 51:53.436
Behind you! Jump!

52:05.030 --> 52:07.490
Come on!
Nice shot. We got one, man!

52:07.615 --> 52:10.743
Come on, pull!
Bring her in, bring her in.

52:12.954 --> 52:15.039
Get off the harness!

52:36.892 --> 52:38.768
Hey.

52:40.270 --> 52:42.355
You have to talk to me.

52:43.815 --> 52:48.402
I'm not in pain but...

52:48.527 --> 52:50.779
I think I'm in trouble.

52:50.905 --> 52:54.241
- I'm so sorry for this, Sara.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

52:54.366 --> 52:56.494
- Yes, it is.
- Matt!

52:56.619 --> 52:58.495
It's Ok.

52:59.537 --> 53:01.789
This is Ok?

53:02.624 --> 53:05.251
None of this is Ok.

53:05.376 --> 53:09.004
We should've left this morning.
We should never even have come here.

53:09.129 --> 53:11.381
I didn't know this was supposed
to happen.

53:11.507 --> 53:14.635
Of course you didn't. Because
you don't think, you just do,

53:14.760 --> 53:18.263
only this time you dragged
all of us down with you.

53:23.226 --> 53:26.479
Nikki, just let it happen.

53:26.604 --> 53:31.066
Does this make you feel better?
Lay it all on me. I'm the fuck-up.

53:31.191 --> 53:35.278
Mum knows it. Dad knew it.
It's never you. It's always me.

53:35.403 --> 53:38.615
It is always you. I wasn't given
the room to make mistakes.

53:38.740 --> 53:41.992
- That room was filled with yours.
- I just wanted you to have fun.

53:42.117 --> 53:45.037
Bullshit. You wanted me to act like you

53:45.162 --> 53:50.500
cos if there's two of us it would make
you seem less of a disappointment.

53:50.625 --> 53:53.795
It must be nice to have your life
so together.

53:54.754 --> 53:56.840
Dad would be proud.

54:12.395 --> 54:15.898
What's up? You all right?

54:16.023 --> 54:19.610
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

54:24.865 --> 54:27.701
You know, er...

54:27.826 --> 54:31.037
when our Dad got sick...

54:32.580 --> 54:36.250
...I knew Matt was pissed at me
for bailing,

54:36.375 --> 54:39.295
but I just didn't know what to do.

54:42.380 --> 54:47.302
After he died, I tried to make it up
to him. I tried to be around more.

54:49.471 --> 54:52.639
I just didn't know
he hated me so much.

54:52.764 --> 54:55.559
He doesn't hate you
as much as he thinks he does.

54:55.684 --> 54:59.688
- All evidence to the contrary.
- He loves you, John.

54:59.813 --> 55:05.359
He's here for you.
Mr Responsible skipped school,

55:05.485 --> 55:09.780
a week away from his finals, just to
spend a weekend with his big brother.

55:11.824 --> 55:14.910
- He can't say no to you.
- Yeah, look where it got him.

55:15.035 --> 55:17.704
None of this is your fault.

55:17.829 --> 55:20.373
You'll get through this.

55:20.499 --> 55:23.709
Besides, you're a hard guy
to stay angry at.

55:23.834 --> 55:25.711
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:25.836 --> 55:28.964
Even I don't hate you
quite as much as I used to.

55:30.007 --> 55:32.384
"Quite."

55:34.469 --> 55:37.138
I really love him, you know.

55:37.263 --> 55:39.557
I know.

55:39.682 --> 55:42.310
I'm glad.

55:47.856 --> 55:49.733
- Hey.
- Want a sip?

55:49.858 --> 55:51.527
Uh-huh.

55:51.652 --> 55:56.030
Your uncle had
very eclectic musical tastes.

55:56.155 --> 55:58.449
That's putting it nicely.

55:58.574 --> 56:00.660
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

56:02.870 --> 56:05.997
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

56:09.918 --> 56:12.337
I feel awful.

56:12.462 --> 56:15.257
Why? You guys have been wanting
to do that for years.

56:15.381 --> 56:18.467
- You'll both recover.
- I hope so.

56:18.592 --> 56:21.137
- You ready to turn this mother out?
- Yes!

56:21.262 --> 56:23.639
- Ready?
- Come on, Mr DJ.

56:26.516 --> 56:30.395
The fuse?
- Yeah. I'll get it. I know where it is.

56:30.520 --> 56:34.065
- I'll come with you.
- No, no. Relax, relax.

56:34.190 --> 56:37.067
Each of you has your job.
You're the future doctor -

56:37.192 --> 56:39.611
smart and calm under pressure.

56:39.736 --> 56:42.531
You're the Eagle Scout
in black sheep's clothing -

56:42.656 --> 56:44.992
quick with a weapon
and handy with a sea plane.

56:45.117 --> 56:49.245
You're the perky, athletic one -
very randy to have around.

56:49.370 --> 56:54.083
And you... you look incredibly sexy
in a bikini.

56:54.208 --> 56:57.169
<i>Now where does all that leave moi?</i>

56:58.211 --> 57:01.214
I'm the one who knows
where the fuse box is.

57:04.301 --> 57:06.761
He's in need of psychiatric help.

57:29.072 --> 57:33.660
Why have they always gotta put
the fuse box in the basement? Damn.

57:36.663 --> 57:39.624
O... k.

57:48.674 --> 57:50.592
Oh!

58:01.185 --> 58:04.021
You're mine, baby.

58:06.148 --> 58:09.318
Oh! You gotta be kidding me.

58:14.781 --> 58:17.742
Almost, baby.

59:02.824 --> 59:03.867
Stay with Sara.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.541
No!

59:20.215 --> 59:22.633
Matt, slide that over here!

59:26.971 --> 59:30.516
They're coming
through the door, Nikki! Hurry!

59:31.642 --> 59:34.519
Come on, come on!
Come on, hurry up!

59:37.564 --> 59:41.359
- Get Sara and get upstairs now!
- Get upstairs!

59:41.860 --> 59:44.779
- Get upstairs!
- Get to the attic!

59:52.661 --> 59:54.120
Oh no!

01:00:08.759 --> 01:00:10.260
Hurry up!

01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:13.096
Matt!

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:21.938
Grab this!

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.236
- Ok?
- Let's go, let's go!

01:00:35.033 --> 01:00:37.451
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

01:00:51.297 --> 01:00:53.383
Get the rope!

01:01:06.103 --> 01:01:09.522
- You Ok?
- My shoulder.

01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:12.650
Oh, my God! You got bitten!

01:02:29.762 --> 01:02:32.847
None of this seems real.

01:02:32.972 --> 01:02:36.351
I can't believe that Noah is dead.

01:02:42.439 --> 01:02:46.902
Ok, look, we'll get out of here.
We'll get you guys to a doctor,

01:02:48.237 --> 01:02:51.572
Whatever it is,
they're gonna figure it out.

01:02:53.825 --> 01:02:56.327
Go away!

01:03:00.832 --> 01:03:02.791
- Hey, Sara, please...
- Get off me!

01:03:17.596 --> 01:03:20.307
- I'm so sorry.
- That's Ok.

01:03:20.433 --> 01:03:23.393
- You know I didn't mean that.
- That's Ok. Come here.

01:03:24.978 --> 01:03:28.356
- I'm sorry.
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:03:28.481 --> 01:03:31.192
- I promise.
- Ok.

01:03:31.317 --> 01:03:33.694
I just don't feel right.

01:03:35.362 --> 01:03:37.448
I know.

01:03:41.577 --> 01:03:43.453
You'll be all right.

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:48.541
Johnny.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.886
AMCS.

01:04:02.179 --> 01:04:06.265
Army Mountain Combat School,
that's who leased the compound.

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:10.853
- So they were training attack dogs?
- Could be experiments that went wrong.

01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:13.731
Why would Uncle Frank
have these papers?

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:19.986
Uncle Frank wouldn't be involved
with something like this.

01:04:20.111 --> 01:04:23.865
- He was an animal rights activist.
- keep telling yourself that.

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:27.534
They probably told him what
he told me - that the dogs got rabies,

01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:31.538
it spread, and that's why
they had to put them all down.

01:04:31.663 --> 01:04:33.749
Well, they missed a few.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.454
- Clear?
- Yeah, we're good.

01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:36.139
You guys get in the room.
Stay there.

01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:41.351
- Be careful.
- I will.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:09.793
What's that smell?

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.045
They've marked their territory.

01:06:13.088 --> 01:06:17.176
We're the ones trespassing now.

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.519
You ready for this?

01:06:30.437 --> 01:06:33.648
No. You?

01:06:33.774 --> 01:06:35.859
No.

01:06:50.455 --> 01:06:53.083
Jesus, Matt. Matt!

01:06:55.627 --> 01:06:58.338
What is he doing? Is he insane?

01:06:59.756 --> 01:07:01.840
He's not afraid.

01:07:05.636 --> 01:07:07.721
So sad.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.309
I've waited ten years
for him to notice me.

01:07:13.434 --> 01:07:16.145
What are you talking about?

01:07:17.688 --> 01:07:20.066
It feels over.

01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:23.360
It's not over. Don't talk like that.

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.633
Pop the clutch!

01:07:52.053 --> 01:07:53.720
Shit!

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:05.189
Come on, Mattie.

01:08:05.356 --> 01:08:07.483
Come on, Mattie!

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:13.947
- Give me the bow.
- Here.

01:08:27.585 --> 01:08:29.962
Heads up, Mattie!

01:08:44.059 --> 01:08:46.435
Come on, come on.

01:08:48.937 --> 01:08:51.148
We need more speed.

01:08:53.524 --> 01:08:54.776
Hold on!

01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:02.241
Better work this time!

01:09:32.185 --> 01:09:35.104
- Cool.
- Piece of cake.

01:09:46.738 --> 01:09:49.200
They don't like the noise.

01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:12.888
Let's go!

01:10:14.515 --> 01:10:18.268
I don't think I'm gonna make
those finals, Johnny.

01:10:21.312 --> 01:10:23.189
Shit!

01:10:29.153 --> 01:10:30.696
Hold on to him!

01:10:48.838 --> 01:10:52.007
Sara won't come down.
You've gotta help.

01:10:52.174 --> 01:10:54.009
I got it, Mattie.

01:10:54.176 --> 01:10:56.053
- I tried everything.
- Get in.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:00.056
Sara!

01:11:01.098 --> 01:11:02.892
- Sara.
- Go away.

01:11:03.017 --> 01:11:04.643
- No.
- Get out!

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:06.270
- No!
- I won't make it.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:09.148
I don't care! Get up! On your feet!

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:15.361
Get out of my house!

01:11:15.528 --> 01:11:18.198
- John, out the window!
- I'm not leaving!

01:11:18.364 --> 01:11:21.992
You understand?
If I break eye contact, it's over.

01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:24.411
I will be right behind you.

01:11:26.288 --> 01:11:28.874
- Gone?
- Yeah.

01:11:47.265 --> 01:11:48.934
You Ok?

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:54.021
Sara!

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.573
- Sara!
- No, no.

01:12:08.576 --> 01:12:10.620
- No!
- Come on!

01:13:06.295 --> 01:13:08.881
That fence didn't used
to be here.

01:13:10.883 --> 01:13:12.968
We'll break through it with the car.

01:13:13.093 --> 01:13:17.555
What if the fence is the only thing
standing between us and those dogs?

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.058
That's true.

01:13:20.183 --> 01:13:23.811
Ok... Ok,
but we'll leave the car running.

01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:28.231
If we turn it off, we don't know
if it'll start again.

01:13:28.356 --> 01:13:30.650
The car's not gonna
get us off this island.

01:13:30.776 --> 01:13:34.821
Well, if we need to,
it'll get us the hell out of here.

01:13:34.946 --> 01:13:37.198
Come on.

01:13:38.741 --> 01:13:42.995
- There's gotta be a radio here.
- It's no good if there's no power.

01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:47.374
- Look.
- Solar panel.

01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:51.836
- We could hook onto that, right?
- Yeah.

01:14:02.763 --> 01:14:06.642
- Were you ever here?
- No, not inside.

01:14:08.184 --> 01:14:10.686
Looks like an attack-protection suit.

01:14:32.164 --> 01:14:34.250
What the hell is all this stuff?

01:14:36.502 --> 01:14:41.172
This was not a training facility.
Something else was going on here.

01:14:42.757 --> 01:14:45.301
They weren't training anything.

01:14:45.427 --> 01:14:50.556
They were genetically redesigning them.
They were playing God.

01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:52.975
No!

01:14:57.521 --> 01:14:59.647
Let's keep moving.

01:15:09.531 --> 01:15:11.825
Here's a radio.

01:15:13.702 --> 01:15:15.370
No power.

01:15:15.495 --> 01:15:18.582
All right, how do we hook in
to the solar power?

01:15:18.707 --> 01:15:21.459
The batteries have to be
around here somewhere.

01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:25.379
Down here.

01:15:34.054 --> 01:15:36.181
- Batteries.
- All right, good.

01:15:36.306 --> 01:15:38.641
I'm gonna check the main first.

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:42.478
Hit the breaker.

01:15:44.355 --> 01:15:47.149
These batteries
are never gonna charge.

01:15:48.317 --> 01:15:50.194
They're too rusted. Look.

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:53.988
No, they're the old lead-acid kind.
They'll hold a charge forever.

01:15:54.113 --> 01:15:57.867
Positive to positive.
Negative to negative. Just like a car.

01:15:59.369 --> 01:16:00.995
You good?

01:16:04.456 --> 01:16:06.792
- Nice.
- Right.

01:16:14.382 --> 01:16:16.467
How do you know all this?

01:16:16.592 --> 01:16:20.638
You'd be surprised what an irresponsible
fuck-up can pick up over the years.

01:16:20.763 --> 01:16:23.223
Ok, here we go.

01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:26.142
Does it Work?

01:16:26.267 --> 01:16:29.312
- It's dead.
- Still no signal.

01:16:29.437 --> 01:16:32.023
Give me that cell phone.
Open the back.

01:16:32.148 --> 01:16:35.609
We can hook up this phone
to the radio tower.

01:16:35.734 --> 01:16:39.405
It's a giant antenna. By itself,
a cell gives you two, three miles,

01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:44.200
but a tower like that gives you
over 100. We attach the cell phone...

01:16:44.325 --> 01:16:47.704
here to the radio antenna.

01:16:49.288 --> 01:16:53.333
Shit. No signal.

01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:57.754
Wait a minute, guys. Look right there,
on the radio tower.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.006
- There's a cable detached.
- I'll go.

01:17:00.132 --> 01:17:03.427
- We gotta stick together.
- I'll go.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:07.972
You guys stay here. Once I connect
the cables, you're gonna see this signal.

01:17:08.097 --> 01:17:13.894
When you see the signal, you wanna
turn on the antenna amplifier here.

01:17:14.019 --> 01:17:15.770
All right.

01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:20.191
Hey... Be careful.

01:17:20.316 --> 01:17:22.944
We're gonna get outta here.

01:17:41.169 --> 01:17:45.922
What's wrong?
Baby, calm down, sit down.

01:17:50.677 --> 01:17:52.846
It's just...

01:17:56.057 --> 01:17:58.642
What happened to Sara
is gonna happen to me.

01:17:58.768 --> 01:18:02.313
Matt, don't talk like that.
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:15.325
What's wrong?

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:17.534
What?

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.536
They're inside.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.997
What are you talking about?

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.334
For the dogs to survive
being put down

01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:27.710
they would've had
to find a way to escape.

01:18:27.835 --> 01:18:31.547
If they found a way out
of the compound...

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.883
They found their way back in.

01:18:37.178 --> 01:18:38.345
John.

01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:06.037
Argh!

01:19:12.459 --> 01:19:14.128
Oh, my God!

01:21:10.483 --> 01:21:13.111
Give Cujo my best.

01:21:24.078 --> 01:21:26.706
Nikki!

01:21:26.831 --> 01:21:28.708
- Nikki!
- No!

01:21:30.084 --> 01:21:32.962
Stop it! Listen! Listen to me!

01:21:33.087 --> 01:21:35.880
There is a boat on the other side
of this fence!

01:21:36.006 --> 01:21:38.091
It's our only way out!

01:21:38.216 --> 01:21:41.594
We're not getting off this island, John!

01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:17.168
Need a ride?

01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:24.592
- I thought you were dead.
- Any ideas?

01:22:24.717 --> 01:22:25.968
Hang on!

01:22:52.992 --> 01:22:55.078
Come on!

01:22:57.496 --> 01:22:59.373
- You Ok?
- Yeah.

01:23:03.085 --> 01:23:04.127
Go!

01:23:12.968 --> 01:23:15.429
John, get the boat started.

01:23:17.348 --> 01:23:19.432
Jump on!

01:23:48.543 --> 01:23:51.044
What do you think's gonna happen
to you guys?

01:23:54.506 --> 01:23:57.175
Find a doctor that can cure it.

01:23:58.593 --> 01:24:01.262
- What if he can't?
- He has to.

01:24:12.272 --> 01:24:14.607
I need some sleep.

01:24:15.305 --> 01:24:21.881
