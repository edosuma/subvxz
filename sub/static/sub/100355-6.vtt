WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:03.742
- Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.786 --> 00:06.049
Astra's dead mother
was a powerful witch.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.224
- Why did you bring me back?

00:07.268 --> 00:09.313
- Natalie,
is that really you?

00:09.357 --> 00:11.663
Natalie brought you here
to help me save Astra.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.665
What do you know
about the loom of fate?

00:13.709 --> 00:15.319
- You want to know
what I'm hiding from?

00:15.363 --> 00:17.060
- Yes, I do.
- It's that bloody loom.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.540
- He still has 10 years.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.063
- Can you make it zero?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.195
Bye-bye, Johnny.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.114
- John?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.332
- John, can you hear me?

00:28.376 --> 00:29.986
What happened?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.293
- He just collapsed
out of nowhere.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.468
- After coughing up
a bucket of blood.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.383
- Come on, Johnny.
Stay with us.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.474
Gideon, we'll need
to run a scan.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.953
- Right away, Dr. Palmer.

00:43.391 --> 00:46.220
- Oxygen mask, please.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.178
The loom.
Where is it, Charlie?

00:48.222 --> 00:49.875
- Not now, John, all right?
You gotta rest.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.313
- What loom?
- Astra's ghost mom, she told--

00:52.356 --> 00:54.097
Oh, my God!
Hold me, hold me, hold me!

00:54.141 --> 00:55.881
- What the hell's going on?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.796
- As you can see from his
chest x-ray, Mr. Constantine

00:57.840 --> 01:00.234
has a very aggressive form
of lung cancer.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.018
I'm afraid it's terminal.

01:05.935 --> 01:10.113
- Well, there's no point
in quitting now.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.123
- ♪ Hey hey hey

01:20.167 --> 01:21.298
♪ Hey hey hey

01:22.995 --> 01:24.910
- There's nothing funny
about lung cancer, John.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.565
-  Who's laughing?

01:27.609 --> 01:30.612
- If you lose your hair, I'm
shaving my head in solidarity.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.309
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a minute.

01:32.353 --> 01:35.138
No saucy AI is butchering me
and pumping me full of--

01:36.835 --> 01:39.664
- I took the liberty
of administering a sedative.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.667
Mr. Constantine needs to rest.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.323
- Gideon, prepare the jumpship.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.325
- Clotho.

01:48.369 --> 01:51.198
Where are you going?

01:51.241 --> 01:53.635
You can't escape us.

01:53.678 --> 01:57.160
- Clotho.
You can't get away.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
- Damn.
- We see you.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.731
- No, you don't.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.516
Oh, mate.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.214
- Charlie.
You're back.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.912
- Well, how are
you doing, B-Easy?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.958
- Where you been?

02:13.002 --> 02:17.137
- Oh, I was just, I was just
hanging out with Constantine.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.095
- How is he?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.271
- Dying.
- What?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.620
- Oh, no, don't worry.
You know John-O.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.145
He's always got a trick
up his sleeve.

02:25.188 --> 02:29.192
- Bro, that donut you made me
eat had me hallucinating.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.368
Starting today,
I'm on a juice cleanse.

02:31.412 --> 02:34.415
- Sorry, this is my...

02:34.458 --> 02:36.591
Friend, Charlie.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.637
Charlie, meet my sister.
- Hmm, good fashion.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.248
- Team meeting on the bridge.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.640
- Does that mean me?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.251
- That means you too, Zari.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.427
- Hmm, cool.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.343
- So you coming?

02:49.386 --> 02:51.649
- I wouldn't miss it.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.786
- Oh, Charlie.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.309
We could really use
your help right now.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.398
With Sara in Star City
and Rory in a mood,

03:01.442 --> 03:02.356
we are short-staffed.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.358
- What's Mick in a mood about?

03:04.401 --> 03:06.055
Ali, his girlfriend.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.275
- Ray, they on--
they only had sex once.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.711
- Well, when you know,
you know.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.279
You know?

03:12.322 --> 03:13.671
- Okay, listen.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.456
I know we're all worried
about John, okay?

03:15.499 --> 03:17.675
And we could just sit back
and wait for a miracle.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.983
But does Marie Kondo rest just
because she built an empire?

03:21.026 --> 03:22.114
- No.
- No.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.464
No, she tidies up.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.422
And that is exactly what
we're gonna continue to do.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.772
We are gonna tidy up
the timeline, yeah?

03:27.816 --> 03:30.819
Gideon, show them
what we've been working on.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.430
Each point represents
a potential encore,

03:33.474 --> 03:37.129
which means we can catch them
before they change history.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.958
I call her,

03:40.002 --> 03:42.222
"The Prognosticator."

03:46.791 --> 03:48.140
- Um...

03:48.184 --> 03:51.143
- Okay, anyway.

03:51.187 --> 03:54.234
There's a category five
in 1997 Hong Kong.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.760
A mysterious gangster is moving
in on the Triad's territory.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.457
Ray, I want you and Zari to QB.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.285
- Oh, you don't have to tell me
to "queen bee."

04:02.329 --> 04:04.592
It'll look her naturally.
- Oh, you know what.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.334
Hong Kong traffic is
notoriously bad.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.379
So why don't we take my new...

04:09.423 --> 04:11.860
- Whoa.
- ♪ Scooter

04:11.903 --> 04:13.427
I call her,

04:13.470 --> 04:15.472
"Scoots McGoots."

04:15.516 --> 04:18.127
- Ah, dude.
- So awesome.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.392
- The scooter,
you're all impressed by?

04:22.436 --> 04:24.481
- Oh, my God,
I need one.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.091
- Wanna go for a ride?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.268
- Yeah.
- Yes.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.791
Ooh.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.793
- And away we go.
- Totally.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.143
- Okay, I'm next.
- Wait, careful.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.536
- Slow down.
- All right, speed 'er up.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.102
- Hey, hey.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.467
- Never been
to Hong Kong before.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.425
So what's the plan?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.428
- I had Gideon cook up the same
sedative she dosed John with.

04:58.472 --> 05:01.083
All we have to do is
inject the encore

05:01.126 --> 05:02.650
and bring him back
to the ship for naptime.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.391
- One problem.
We're just supposed to hope

05:04.434 --> 05:06.306
the encore shows up
looking for a copper?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.917
- This is no ordinary tea shop.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.183
- It's owned by the Triad.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.186
- Nate,
how's the perimeter sweep?

05:17.229 --> 05:20.450
- No sign of a gangster
from hell yet.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.365
- So it looks like
we've arrived

05:22.409 --> 05:24.019
right as Great Britain
was getting ready

05:24.062 --> 05:26.195
to hand control
of Hong Kong back to China.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.458
- Oh, well that's
probably not pertinent,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.242
but keep up the research.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.505
- Psst.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.897
- Gary,
what are you doing here?

05:32.941 --> 05:34.464
- John's trying
to leave the ship.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.813
You have to stop him.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.511
- You should return to
the med bay,

05:37.554 --> 05:38.816
Mr. Constantine.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.514
- John, what are you
doing out and about?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.385
- Listen, Big Man.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.431
Look, I know you're only
trying to help, all right?

05:44.474 --> 05:47.564
But nobody gets stage four
lung cancer this fast.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.871
Some sneaky git
with a grudge against me

05:49.914 --> 05:51.438
is bending the rules of magic.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.396
- Oh, who could hate you
that much?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
The list is long.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.574
I'm taking the jumpship home
to narrow it.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.576
- John, no.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.012
I cannot let you
leave this ship.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.275
You are in need
of medical supervision.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.974
- Oh, you can't let me?

06:06.017 --> 06:08.672
You forget who I am,
Old Son?

06:14.591 --> 06:16.463
- Fine.

06:16.506 --> 06:17.768
But I'm going with you.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.205
- Hallelujah.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.425
That was intense.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.648
- Your encore's a no-show.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.258
I say we split.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.336
- 13th century armor.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.426
Fu Manchu mustache.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.515
Guys?

07:08.558 --> 07:10.691
I think I know
who the encore is.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.348
It's Genghis freaking Khan.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.796
- How the hell did
Genghis Khan get to 1997

07:28.839 --> 07:30.450
and learn
how to ride a motorbike?

07:30.493 --> 07:33.931
- Genghis used horses
to revolutionize warfare.

07:33.975 --> 07:37.674
A motorbike's
a modern day horse.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.372
- Looks like he's meeting
with the Triad.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.914
- What sort of man steals
my drugs when my nephew's here,

07:59.957 --> 08:02.612
only to return them to me?

08:02.656 --> 08:06.268
- I have only one interest.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.575
Conquest.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.794
Surrender the Triad to me,

08:10.838 --> 08:13.536
and I will remake the globe.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.712
- And if I refuse?

08:19.411 --> 08:21.109
- We're not getting
in that room.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.414
We should abort.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.590
Regroup on the ship.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.982
- What?
And stay in Hong Kong longer?

08:25.026 --> 08:27.681
Give me the syringe.
Let's finish this.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.686
B., I'm gonna need
a distraction.

08:32.729 --> 08:33.687
- It's too dangerous.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.210
- Any moment.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.604
- Charlie, stop.
Don't do this.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.345
- B., run.

08:50.921 --> 08:54.577
- We're the cops.
Freeze, jackass.

09:02.672 --> 09:03.673
- Great distraction, B.

09:12.769 --> 09:16.120
- No.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.385
- Genghis is leaving.
I'm going after him.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.605
- Charlie, wait.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.322
- Charlie?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.604
- I'm out.
- Me too.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.171
- Drop your guns.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.786
Shoot him.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
- Huh?
- Nice timing.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.239
Scoots?

10:36.070 --> 10:37.680
- Shoot him!
- He's immortal.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.813
- And I'm not.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.470
- You're lucky.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.823
Maybe next time,
not so lucky.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.878
Gary, bring me the foxglove,
a serpent's tongue,

11:01.922 --> 11:04.751
and the hair of an albino.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.057
- All right.
- John, you need some water?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.581
- Bollocks.
No mate.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.845
Just do me a favor
and pull up the rug.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.631
- What are you planning?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.111
Summoning spell.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.983
I'm gonna throttle the bastard
that did this to me.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.681
- Are you really up for that?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.595
- Yeah, no two-bit demon
is getting the better of me.

11:23.639 --> 11:27.599
I'm John Constantine,
and I am devious to the core.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.079
- I added honey,
just how you like it.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.603
- Good, now give it here.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.621
- ♪ Johnny

11:52.668 --> 11:54.670
- Show your face.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.629
- The great John Constantine.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.979
Brought to his knees.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.851
There are denizens
of heaven and hell

12:01.895 --> 12:04.898
who would kill to see this.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.166
Surprise.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.913
- Astra.
Why?

12:19.956 --> 12:22.654
- You're bad
for business, John.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.787
The cancer was already
in your lungs.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.702
I just sped it up.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.226
- I swear this magic
is way beyond you, love.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.576
Look, whoever helped you,
whatever you promised them

12:31.620 --> 12:34.144
in exchange,
trust me, it's a trap.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.886
- I'll keep that in mind.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.019
You know,
I would have expected

12:39.062 --> 12:42.152
your purgatory
to be a little more...

12:44.633 --> 12:45.808
Gruesome.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.855
- Well, you don't remember
this place then.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.987
Your mother brought you here.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.511
- So that's your angle.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.905
I knew you'd try something,
John.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.341
- Astra,

12:57.385 --> 12:59.648
I can change
your mother's fate.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.129
All right,
she never dies,

13:02.172 --> 13:04.566
you never go to hell,
your dad, he...

13:04.609 --> 13:06.786
He never drowns his sorrow
in booze.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.832
Your family can be whole again.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.748
- Tempting.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.404
But everyone you try to help,

13:16.447 --> 13:17.927
you hurt.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.624
- This is different,
all right?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.583
I know someone who has a lead
on a very powerful artifact.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.238
"I know someone."

13:24.281 --> 13:27.589
John, listen to yourself.
It's pathetic.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.938
- No, what is pathetic

13:28.982 --> 13:30.853
is that someone
who is so content to rule hell

13:30.897 --> 13:33.638
because they are too scared
to make a go at a real life.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.598
Look, this is
what Natalie wanted, love.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.731
I just,
I need a little more time.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.864
- Time is something
you're running low on.

13:43.997 --> 13:47.043
- Oh, thank God.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.134
No, the Man Upstairs
had nothing to do with this.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
It was Astra.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
She owns the chip to my soul.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.532
She's figured out a way
how to spin down the dial

13:57.575 --> 13:59.969
on the time I have left.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.623
Thanks.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.754
- John, I'm sorry.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.626
- Oh, cheer up, lads.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.237
This dog is still in the fight.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.412
- That went well.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.153
My "queen bee-ing," I mean.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.025
You four almost
got yourselves killed.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
- I had fun.
- Fun?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
You got us stuck
in the middle of a shootout.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
That's why I love Bruce Lee.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.119
He never uses guns.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.860
- Keep your knickers on.
You have wind powers.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.949
You could have just stopped
the bullets mid-air.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.081
- Stop bullets?
You're crazy.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.909
- Look, this is all my fault.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.825
We should have been gathering
intel, not doping the encore.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.479
Gideon?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.133
- I'm currently tracking
Genghis Khan's whereabouts

14:33.176 --> 14:34.699
via his license plate.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.484
- Great, 'cause we need
to figure out how and why

14:36.527 --> 14:38.921
Genghis just showed up
in 1997 Hong Kong.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
Charlie, you up
for some undercover work?

14:41.097 --> 14:42.925
- Oh, I get it, just because
I'm the shape-shifter,

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
I have to be the one to
infiltrate the criminal gang.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.234
- Sorry, pause.
You're a shape-shifter?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.497
- Yeah,
I am actually.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.108
I can shift
into anyone you like.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
- Anyone?
- Yeah, anyone.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.546
- Hah.
- All right, come on.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.072
- Where's Mick?
I'm gonna get a drink.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.030
- I need to smoke.
- Well, I...

15:02.336 --> 15:04.077
- I don't get it.
They used to be best buds.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.948
- Oh, there's only
one explanation.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.125
B. and Charlie went
to pound town.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.433
- Ew, gross, ugh.
- Wait, what?

15:12.476 --> 15:14.130
- Moan zone?

15:14.174 --> 15:15.827
Smash city?

15:15.871 --> 15:18.047
- Ava.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.092
They had sex?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.643
All right, guys.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.210
I'll see you in a bit.
- Charlie.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.038
- Oh, here we go.
Another lecture.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.996
- No, I just...

15:54.040 --> 15:55.128
Be careful.

16:06.704 --> 16:10.099
- She won't talk.

16:10.143 --> 16:14.190
- Ah, the hero cop
from the tea house.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.106
- Ava, you there?

16:17.150 --> 16:18.455
- Yeah, Charlie.
You find something?

16:18.499 --> 16:20.501
- Genghis kidnapped
your cop friend.

16:22.372 --> 16:26.724
- What do we have here?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.726
Only one child.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.554
How unambitious.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.382
Nevertheless,

16:32.426 --> 16:35.255
give me what I desire,

16:35.298 --> 16:38.127
and I will spare his life.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.091
- John, Nora's here.
- All right, I'm coming.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.579
- Okay, Pippa.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.408
Can you wish our friend, John,
healthy like we discussed?

16:58.452 --> 17:01.237
- Yes, but I want
something first.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.718
- Pippa's made
a lot of progress,

17:03.761 --> 17:06.851
but we're still working
on a few challenges.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.070
- Hey.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.073
The Master of the Dark Arts
needs your help.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.075
- Shut up, four eyes.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.251
- Now you listen to me,
you little squirt.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.253
Are you gonna make
that damn wish?

17:17.297 --> 17:19.255
Because if you don't
and I die,

17:19.299 --> 17:21.083
then I'm gonna come back
and haunt you

17:21.127 --> 17:24.956
every waking hour of your life.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.262
- Fairy Godmother,

17:26.306 --> 17:28.612
I wish your scary
British friend wasn't sick.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.137
- There you go, easy.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.313
- Okay.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.119
No matter.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
I'll try something else.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.297
- I wish I was home.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.169
- Sorry.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.476
Bye, Ray.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.915
- Bye, Nora.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.573
So when did you and Charlie,

18:16.617 --> 18:18.140
you know?

18:18.184 --> 18:20.186
It's that obvious?

18:20.229 --> 18:21.448
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.363
- After "Heyworld."

18:23.406 --> 18:26.061
- Wow.
That's nice.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.282
How was it?
She shape-shift?

18:29.325 --> 18:30.413
- That's what we
wanna talk about?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.459
- 100%, but we don't have to.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.244
Look, Charlie's
clearly affecting you.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.550
- So come on.
Talk to me.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.726
- It's stupid.
- What?

18:38.769 --> 18:41.294
- She left
without saying goodbye.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.384
- Mm.
Yeah, that sucks.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.560
But if you were thousands
of years old,

18:46.603 --> 18:47.996
wouldn't you be over goodbyes?

18:48.039 --> 18:50.390
- The least she
could've done is texted.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.740
How hard is it
to send a ghost emoji?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.698
- Maybe it wasn't about you.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.052
- Dumb Dumb's got a good point.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.838
B., chin up.
You are a catch.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.709
If there was a female version
of you,

19:05.753 --> 19:07.537
I would be all over her.
Fact.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.192
- Like my sister?
- Absolutely.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.846
But the point is

19:11.889 --> 19:14.240
we don't know
why Charlie didn't say goodbye.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.067
So just check your ego

19:16.111 --> 19:17.373
and ask her.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.724
- You're right.
Thanks, Nate.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.205
- My man.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.688
Where's our prisoner?

19:36.653 --> 19:39.221
- Even with Prince Charles'
motorcade route,

19:39.265 --> 19:41.005
he'll be heavily guarded.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.833
- Wait, Prince Charles
is the target?

19:42.877 --> 19:45.271
- He's here to hand Hong Kong
back to China.

19:45.314 --> 19:49.449
What if The Khan wants Prince
Charles to give to him instead?

19:49.492 --> 19:52.278
- An authoritarian power
wants to control Hong Kong.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.453
That sounds familiar.

20:01.983 --> 20:05.116
- The worst part
of my resurrection

20:05.160 --> 20:10.644
was finding myself buried
in an impenetrable tomb.

20:10.687 --> 20:15.083
It took me 700 years
to dig myself out.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.395
- The best part
of my resurrection

20:22.438 --> 20:26.050
was the sword
I was buried with.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.273
- Genghis just killed a cop
with a hell weapon.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.536
- Son of a bitch.
Okay, you got what we needed.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.625
Charlie,
get the hell out of there.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.413
- Yeung.

20:40.456 --> 20:43.546
What is the status of my fleet?

20:43.590 --> 20:46.070
- Your fleet?

20:46.114 --> 20:50.336
- The one you are building
to conquer the globe.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.251
- Right.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.861
Fleet's great.

20:53.904 --> 20:57.081
In fact, I have to go
check on it right now.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.486
Don't freak out.
I can explain.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.494
Never mind.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.628
- Clotho.

21:21.671 --> 21:24.370
- No matter
what face you wear,

21:24.413 --> 21:26.328
you can't hide from us.

21:32.595 --> 21:36.251
No.
Leave me alone, ugh.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.564
- Are you okay?

21:44.607 --> 21:46.957
- Yeah,
I'm fine.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.540
- So what's the verdict?
Can you heal me?

22:06.020 --> 22:08.936
- Well, then.
Screw you.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.505
- Come with me.
He didn't mean that.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.638
- Yeah, I did.

22:17.510 --> 22:21.035
- I wish you would just let us
take you to the oncologist.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.342
- Raymond, how many times
do I have to tell you?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.604
This is a disease

22:24.647 --> 22:27.389
caused by magic,
and only magic can fix it.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.522
"How to Add Years
to Your Life."

22:29.565 --> 22:31.088
Yeah, that should do it.

22:31.132 --> 22:34.396
Although the ingredient list
is a little unusual.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.138
We'll need a medieval knight.

22:37.181 --> 22:40.359
- I was once knighted
"Sir Raymond of the Palms."

22:40.402 --> 22:43.405
- Great.
Gary, grab a knife.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.580
We're gonna perform a little

22:44.624 --> 22:46.669
back alley surgery
on the Big Man.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.976
- What kind of surgery?

22:49.019 --> 22:51.413
- Well, first off,
are you uncircumcised?

22:52.588 --> 22:53.937
- Well, I'll take that
as a yes.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.853
Gary, the knife.
- No.

22:56.897 --> 23:00.074
We tried Nora.
We tried the Puca.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.339
What if there isn't a cure?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.732
Isn't there anyone you--

23:05.775 --> 23:08.865
that you need
to say goodbye to?

23:08.909 --> 23:12.521
What about a bucket list?

23:12.565 --> 23:16.046
Goodbyes are for saps.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.745
And bucket lists are
for mealy-mouthed cowards

23:18.788 --> 23:22.313
who don't have the courage
to carpe the bloody diem.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.793
- I have a bucket list.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.840
- Well, thank you
for proving my point, Raymond.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.581
- Stop being so mean.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.843
You know, we're trying
to help you--

23:29.886 --> 23:31.584
- Help me?
- Yes.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.629
- Captain America
and the village idiot.

23:33.673 --> 23:34.848
Well, I don't need your help.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.719
I take care of myself.
I always have.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.852
What, you think I'm gonna let
Astra beat me?

23:38.895 --> 23:41.158
I will fight,
and I will scheme,

23:41.202 --> 23:43.683
and I will make a deal
with the archangel himself.

23:43.726 --> 23:48.557
You hear that, Gabriel?
Hey, come and get me.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.517
Have I got an offer for you.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.915
- Looks like he's not coming.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.440
- Well, I'll think
of something, I always do.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.833
Now, piss off, I've had
enough of the pair of you.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.619
Go on.
Piss off!

24:13.974 --> 24:14.801
- Hello.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.542
- Who the hell are you?

24:16.585 --> 24:18.326
- I'm the last
queen of France.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.675
- Right, just when
I thought this ship

24:19.719 --> 24:21.503
couldn't get any more barmy.

24:24.985 --> 24:27.291
- Looking for a time courier?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.427
Why are you in such
a hurry to leave?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.081
Again.
- You know me.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.735
Always looking
for the next party.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.780
- Usually, I would buy that.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.348
But you just almost walked
into a truck.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.567
Something has you spooked.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.047
Is whatever's going on
the reason why you left?

24:44.091 --> 24:46.572
- Here we go.
- Look, I'll admit it.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.399
I liked you.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.924
I was hurt when you left.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.796
And I've felt weird
ever since you returned.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.798
Now, can you be honest with me?

24:56.799 --> 24:58.671
- Honestly,

24:58.714 --> 25:00.629
you are starting
to piss me off.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.675
You know, we had sex,
and it was mediocre.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.982
Get over it.

25:06.026 --> 25:09.551
- Wow, okay.
I'm gonna ignore that.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.553
If you don't wanna talk, fine.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.600
But we're about to go up
against Genghis Khan.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.950
Don't leave now.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.431
Just give me the courier.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.831
- Bye, Charlie.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.489
- Mediocre is no bad.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.147
- Charlie's gone?
How could you let her leave?

25:40.190 --> 25:42.715
- I didn't.
It was her choice.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.587
- Okay, hey, how about
we focus on Genghis Khan?

25:45.631 --> 25:46.936
- You're right.
We need to stop him

25:46.980 --> 25:48.677
from attacking
Prince Charles' motorcade.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.723
- Well, he's on his way
to a ceremony

25:50.766 --> 25:53.116
ending 156 years
of colonial rule, so.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.423
- Have you been
researching history?

25:55.466 --> 25:57.817
- Oh, sorry.
That's your thing, right?

25:57.860 --> 25:59.514
- No, but it's cool
that you're into--

25:59.558 --> 26:00.602
- Okay.
Hey, okay.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.125
Moving on, right?
- Mm-hmm.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.823
- Turns out the person Charlie
impersonated is an engineer.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.564
There's a shipment
coming in tonight.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.827
I'll bet you that's the fleet
Genghis uses for his attack.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.219
- What kind of fleet?
- Whatever it is,

26:09.263 --> 26:11.308
it's the next step
of modern warfare.

26:11.352 --> 26:13.876
I'll go to the docks.
I'll try to figure it out.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.183
- Okay, Zari and I
will monitor the airspace

26:16.226 --> 26:17.924
above the motorcade,
and you'll be on the street.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.621
I know it's a lot
of ground to cover.

26:19.665 --> 26:23.407
If Charlie was here--
- I get it. I'm on my own.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.718
- I can't believe
you stooped to trying

26:29.762 --> 26:32.591
to make a deal
with an angel. Mm.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.767
- What the...

26:34.810 --> 26:38.118
- Gabriel would have
turned you into his slave.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.207
- Well, at least
I'd be alive.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.166
-  There are worse
fates than death.

26:43.210 --> 26:46.866
- Oy.
I will shove you

26:46.909 --> 26:49.999
where the sun don't shine
just to shut you up.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.306
- Hmm.
You'd probably enjoy that.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.963
Hell of a way to spend your
last nights on earth though,

26:57.006 --> 26:59.052
you arrogant bastard.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.794
Especially when
you could be with two

27:01.837 --> 27:04.361
of the only friends
you have left.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.930
- Yeah.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.280
Yeah.
Nice one.

27:18.811 --> 27:22.205
I just feel so helpless.

27:22.249 --> 27:26.122
You know?
- Me too, Gary.

27:26.166 --> 27:29.952
- If he has to go, I just,
I want him to be at peace.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.607
- Well, that's not his style.
John's gonna go out

27:32.651 --> 27:33.695
the way he lived.
- Yeah.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.002
- Like a bloody wanker, eh?

27:37.438 --> 27:38.831
You know it occurs to me

27:38.874 --> 27:41.703
that I might owe you two
a bit of an apology.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.313
- We accept.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.880
- Oh, that's okay.

27:44.924 --> 27:45.968
Come on, sit--

27:46.012 --> 27:47.622
All right, okay.
You're hurting me.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.928
Go on.
- Oh.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.712
- Sit down.
Stop bloody fussing, will you?

27:53.236 --> 27:56.718
You know, I can't remember the
last time this room was used

27:56.762 --> 27:58.067
as an actual kitchen.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.722
- Well, there's a roast
in the oven.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.116
It'll be ready soon.
- Mm.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.210
Did I ever tell you both
about the time

28:10.253 --> 28:14.780
I met the ghost
of Winston Churchill?

28:18.914 --> 28:20.133
- Behrad, what's your status?

28:20.176 --> 28:22.004
- It's complete gridlock.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.919
- No one's getting through
on the ground.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.399
The fleet must be in the air.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.227
- Nate, did you
find the shipment?

28:28.968 --> 28:31.535
- Oh, no.
We're too late.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.277
Whatever there was,
there was a lot of them.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.671
- Nate, get downtown
and help Behrad.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.933
- Hold on.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.805
I think they might have
left something.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.247
- What's that noise?

28:50.424 --> 28:52.774
- Oh, my God.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.044
- Scoots.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.527
Khan!

29:23.849 --> 29:26.939
- Charge!

29:41.867 --> 29:43.869
- They're getting through
the gridlock on their scooters.

29:43.912 --> 29:47.220
Heading for
Prince Charles' motorcade.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.837
- Stay down, Your Majesty.
Turn here.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.247
- I could really use
some help!

30:14.290 --> 30:16.292
- Nate, tell me
you're close, please.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.991
- I'd be lying.

30:19.034 --> 30:22.646
B., it's your time.
You got this.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.525
- Protect the prince!

30:32.831 --> 30:34.702
Get down.
Take cover.

30:34.745 --> 30:37.009
Look out.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.587
Not again.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.549
- Look who it is.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.814
- I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you, Prince Charles.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.947
- It's not your fault.

31:01.990 --> 31:05.515
But my friends call me Charlie.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.086
Apprehend this imposter.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.483
- Show your true form,

31:16.526 --> 31:18.485
or I end him.

31:23.359 --> 31:27.929
Looks like your luck
has run out, shape-shifter.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.975
Where is the prince?

31:30.018 --> 31:31.802
- Sorry, Genghi.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.979
He's somewhere
you'll never find him.

31:36.155 --> 31:39.114
- Your shape-shifting
friend said

31:39.158 --> 31:41.551
you need to tell your team
that I'm here.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.814
- And I told her
I'm on my beer break.

31:43.858 --> 31:47.079
Now shut up, Princess,
and listen.

31:49.255 --> 31:52.432
- I've never met one
of your kind before.

31:58.264 --> 32:01.093
You will be my 13th wife.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.529
- Come again, mate?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.966
- Your power will serve
my reign well.

32:05.010 --> 32:11.146
Join me as I build a new empire
that will span the globe.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.408
- Look, I'm flattered,

32:12.452 --> 32:15.020
but I've had power
of immortals and gods alike.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.760
It blows.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.416
My past is complicated.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.593
And being in a relationship...

32:23.637 --> 32:26.988
Trust me, that wouldn't
end well for either of us.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.295
- Wait.

32:29.338 --> 32:32.820
Did you two sleep together
or something?

32:35.127 --> 32:37.303
What a shame.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.958
Kill her.
- What?

32:40.001 --> 32:42.177
No.
Come on.

33:20.172 --> 33:24.045
- Unless you lot want those
bullets firing back at you,

33:24.089 --> 33:25.742
bugger off.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.833
- Run away!
Run away!

33:29.877 --> 33:32.880
Run away!
Run away!

33:32.923 --> 33:34.490
- I told you
you could stop bullets.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.057
- Not that I wanted
to find out.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.146
Come here.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.804
Yeah, that was sick.
- I know.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.807
Is that Genghis' toothpick?
- Well, yeah, you want it?

33:46.850 --> 33:49.375
- Oh, no, it's disgusting.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.206
- You said
you were gonna tell us

33:54.249 --> 33:55.424
what's really going on
with you.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.035
Look, I'm just,

33:57.078 --> 33:59.167
I'm still trying
to find the words, all right?

33:59.211 --> 34:01.213
- Can you try
to find them faster?

34:01.256 --> 34:02.692
Fine.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.174
I'm just gonna
come out with it.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.307
I am a Fate.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.268
- One of the three
old Greek ladies?

34:13.312 --> 34:16.532
- That's offensive,
but correct.

34:16.576 --> 34:19.840
- Which one are you?
- Clotho, the spinner.

34:19.883 --> 34:23.409
- I'm super confused,
but what do you spin?

34:23.452 --> 34:25.324
- Look, I don't spin
anything anymore,

34:25.367 --> 34:27.717
but I used to spin
people's futures.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.284
- On your loom?

34:29.328 --> 34:31.286
- Oh, lovely.
Even Gideon's joining in.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.635
Yes, there was a loom,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.246
but I destroyed it
thousands of years ago.

34:34.289 --> 34:37.336
No one should have
that kind of power.

34:37.379 --> 34:40.208
I think people should just
decide their own destinies.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.470
- Why didn't you just tell us?

34:41.514 --> 34:43.037
- Look, I've been keeping
this secret

34:43.081 --> 34:45.474
for my entire bloody existence,
all right?

34:45.518 --> 34:48.347
I've never told anyone.

34:48.390 --> 34:51.045
- Can we see your OG form?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.394
- Absolutely not.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.961
- Is it 'cause you're old?

34:54.004 --> 34:55.832
- It's because your eyes
would explode, all right?

34:55.876 --> 34:57.921
And your ears too if you could
hear my original voice.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.749
- Why are you running?

34:59.793 --> 35:01.882
- My sisters are coming
after me.

35:01.925 --> 35:04.014
They have been ever since
I destroyed our loom.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.582
- Wait, you've been running
for thousands of years?

35:06.626 --> 35:10.108
- Yes, and I've always stayed
one step ahead.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.154
I scattered the loom pieces
across the multiverse,

35:13.198 --> 35:14.851
which took away
my sisters' powers.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.506
But now that we're all
in one universe--

35:17.550 --> 35:20.205
thanks to Sara and
her merry band of paragons--

35:20.248 --> 35:22.381
the loom pieces are back
on one plane.

35:22.424 --> 35:26.167
And now it's only a matter of
time until my sisters find me.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.560
- And when they do?

35:27.603 --> 35:31.999
- They'll kill me.
And anyone that I'm with.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.306
Which is why I left.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.091
And it's why I'm out that door

35:37.135 --> 35:39.398
now that we're done playing
ask a fate.

35:41.269 --> 35:44.446
- Stop running.
We got your back.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.496
- That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.020
My sisters are no joke.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.761
- Well, we're the Legends.

35:54.804 --> 35:58.852
- Yeah, we can take down
a couple old ladies.

36:05.902 --> 36:08.383
- What is with
all these damn scooters?

36:08.427 --> 36:09.689
They're a menace.

36:09.732 --> 36:13.997
Oh, hey, guys.
What did I miss?

36:23.355 --> 36:27.489
- John, this wine is delicious.
- And nutritious.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.449
- Well, there's no point
in saving the good stuff, eh?

36:30.492 --> 36:32.277
- I'm never gonna drink
with you again.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.627
- Oh, come on, mate.
Stiff upper lip, eh?

36:34.670 --> 36:36.455
- I'm gonna miss you so much,
you know?

36:36.498 --> 36:38.413
Nothing can make me
feel better.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.067
- Oh, bollocks, all right.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.897
Look, I didn't want you
to see my will until I died.

36:43.940 --> 36:48.467
But Raymond,
can you do the honors?

36:48.510 --> 36:50.425
- Sure.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.212
You're giving this house
to Gary?

36:57.780 --> 37:00.348
- Bloody hell, that was
supposed to make you happy.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.132
Not insufferable.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.831
- I promise to take great care
of this place, you know?

37:04.874 --> 37:07.790
I'll feed the hellhounds,
I'll vacuum--

37:07.834 --> 37:10.315
- You know, why don't we
talk about what you had

37:10.358 --> 37:12.447
on your bucket list,
eh, mate?

37:12.491 --> 37:14.057
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.451
Give me something
meaningful, eh?

37:16.495 --> 37:20.716
- Well, eventually I...

37:22.283 --> 37:25.286
Plan on asking Nora
to marry me.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.072
- Can I be your flower boy?

37:29.856 --> 37:33.903
- Oh, that's very sweet, Gary.
Odd, but very sweet.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.906
- Why haven't you
asked her yet, Big Man?

37:36.950 --> 37:40.649
- I've been engaged
twice before.

37:40.693 --> 37:44.000
Both times didn't end
as I had hoped.

37:44.044 --> 37:49.397
- You know, life, it is too
short to dillydally, Raymond.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.703
I know you--you can take that

37:50.746 --> 37:54.315
from a man
who has nothing but regrets.

37:55.621 --> 37:58.450
So if you love that witch,

37:58.493 --> 38:00.974
you bloody will marry her,
right?

38:05.544 --> 38:07.067
No, no, no.
I'm all right, I'm all right.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.722
Now how about a toast, eh?

38:11.027 --> 38:13.247
- Okay.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.423
- No, with this.

38:15.467 --> 38:19.688
Oh, of all the ways
that I'd thought I'd go,

38:19.732 --> 38:24.302
decapitated by a demon,
eviscerated by an elemental,

38:24.345 --> 38:28.175
I wouldn't have picked
being at home with my mates.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.220
Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.310
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:49.414 --> 38:53.113
You know, I just wish
I had more time with you...

38:53.156 --> 38:54.680
lovely idiots.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.770
- Well, you're not dead yet,
John.

38:57.813 --> 39:00.555
- No, but I
will be momentarily.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.869
John Constantine.

39:09.912 --> 39:12.785
He always goes out
on his own terms.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.179
- John?

39:20.662 --> 39:22.751
- Couldn't wait
to see me, John.

39:22.795 --> 39:25.928
60 seconds and you're dead.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.845
Poison does that.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.418
It was the same poison your
mother used to kill herself.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.508
- You won't change my mind.

39:40.552 --> 39:43.468
- I'm not trying to.

39:43.511 --> 39:46.514
I just want you know that...

39:46.558 --> 39:49.735
even though you gave up on her,

39:49.778 --> 39:52.346
your mum never gave up on you.
