00:10.051 --> 00:12.554
(Theme music, country style)

00:20.354 --> 00:22.648
(Sizzling)

00:22.731 --> 00:25.024
(Exhaling)

00:27.486 --> 00:29.989
(Ice rattling in glass)

(Liquid trickling)

00:32.407 --> 00:34.159
Cameraman:

00:32.407 --> 00:34.159
Hey, Bubs,

00:32.407 --> 00:34.159
what's the plan?

00:34.242 --> 00:35.786
Bubbles:

00:34.242 --> 00:35.786
What's the plan?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.746
I don't know what

00:35.870 --> 00:37.746
the fucking plan is.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.540
I know what the plan

00:37.830 --> 00:39.540
was<i> going</i> to be.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.334
It was going to be

00:39.623 --> 00:42.334
go shoot my music

00:39.623 --> 00:42.334
video all day,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.253
but Ricky and Julian get all

00:42.417 --> 00:45.253
fucked up again, of course.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.130
So I don't know what

00:45.337 --> 00:47.130
the fucking plan is.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.424
I guess it's me

00:47.214 --> 00:49.424
being pissed off.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.301
That's the plan.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.595
I can't fucking believe

00:51.385 --> 00:53.595
you did this.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.847
Can't believe it,

00:53.679 --> 00:54.847
Julian.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.640
Could be the biggest

00:54.930 --> 00:56.640
day of our lives

00:56.724 --> 00:59.267
and you just decide,

00:56.724 --> 00:59.267
"Oh, I'm going to

00:56.724 --> 00:59.267
get fucking wasted

00:59.351 --> 01:00.602
and not remember

00:59.351 --> 01:00.602
anything."

01:00.686 --> 01:02.312
I'm here with you,

01:00.686 --> 01:02.312
aren't I?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.023
Look, I'm not

01:02.396 --> 01:04.023
Ricky's fucking

01:02.396 --> 01:04.023
babysitter, Bubbles.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.107
I'm not saying you

01:04.105 --> 01:06.107
are his babysitter,

01:06.191 --> 01:08.610
but for fuck's sakes,

01:06.191 --> 01:08.610
you should know better.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.905
You said you

01:08.694 --> 01:10.905
were going to bed

01:10.988 --> 01:12.823
and then you let him

01:10.988 --> 01:12.823
just go out at 3:00

01:10.988 --> 01:12.823
in the morning?

01:12.907 --> 01:14.658
What do you think's

01:12.907 --> 01:14.658
going to happen?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.994
Of course, he's going

01:14.742 --> 01:16.994
to get fucking lost.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.994
Bubs... I had to.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.621
I had to, I had

01:17.077 --> 01:19.621
a chick with me.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.206
A chick with you?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.206
What do you mean?

01:21.289 --> 01:23.083
I picked up a chick

01:21.289 --> 01:23.083
at the 7-11.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.376
Brought her back

01:23.166 --> 01:24.376
to the van.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
You banged a chick

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
in the van

01:26.294 --> 01:28.087
with me on the backseat

01:26.294 --> 01:28.087
right behind you?

01:28.171 --> 01:30.173
I didn't bang her,

01:28.171 --> 01:30.173
I just did a bunch

01:28.171 --> 01:30.173
of necking

01:30.257 --> 01:31.967
and got some

01:30.257 --> 01:31.967
shit going, man.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.218
She was hot.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.218
Ricky:

01:32.051 --> 01:33.218
Boys!

01:33.301 --> 01:34.636
There's Ricky.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.513
Check this fucking

01:34.720 --> 01:36.513
thing out I found.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.223
Julian: Oh my fuck...

01:36.597 --> 01:38.223
This thing's

01:36.597 --> 01:38.223
awesome, man!

01:38.306 --> 01:40.099
You get exercise

01:38.306 --> 01:40.099
and you get fucking

01:38.306 --> 01:40.099
hammered.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.727
Ricky, tell me

01:40.183 --> 01:41.727
you didn't spend

01:41.810 --> 01:44.103
all of our

01:41.810 --> 01:44.103
fucking cash.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.103
Not all of it, no.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.814
You seemed to want

01:44.187 --> 01:45.814
to do a task today,

01:45.898 --> 01:47.566
so I want to get hammered

01:45.898 --> 01:47.566
going around the city.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.192
Ricky, for fuck's sakes,

01:49.276 --> 01:51.152
we're supposed

01:49.276 --> 01:51.152
to be making my

01:49.276 --> 01:51.152
music video today.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.697
I've got to get to

01:51.236 --> 01:53.697
Manuel's Suit Shop.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.199
Terry, can you

01:53.781 --> 01:56.199
take us down to

01:53.781 --> 01:56.199
the suit shop, man?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.451
Terry:

01:56.283 --> 01:57.451
Hell, yeah, no

01:56.283 --> 01:57.451
problem, Rickster.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.286
Hop the fuck

01:57.534 --> 01:59.286
on, boys! Yeah!

01:59.369 --> 02:00.746
Terry:

01:59.369 --> 02:00.746
Hop up, fellas.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
"Rickster"?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
Are you fucking

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
kidding me, Ricky?

02:02.915 --> 02:06.794
(Carnival-type music playing)

02:06.877 --> 02:08.253
...fucking hammered.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.463
This is awesome!

02:10.338 --> 02:12.424
Holy fuck, boys,

02:10.338 --> 02:12.424
she got a little

02:10.338 --> 02:12.424
messy last night.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.968
Did you guys do

02:12.507 --> 02:13.968
anything fun?

02:14.051 --> 02:16.887
I was in bed, asleep

02:14.051 --> 02:16.887
in the van, Ricky.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.472
And he was

02:16.971 --> 02:18.472
banging hookers.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.307
I wasn't banging

02:18.555 --> 02:20.307
and she wasn't

02:18.555 --> 02:20.307
a hooker.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.351
Where did you go?

02:23.435 --> 02:25.980
I came down

02:23.435 --> 02:25.980
after we got here,

02:26.063 --> 02:28.732
I did a bunch of

02:26.063 --> 02:28.732
shooters until

02:26.063 --> 02:28.732
about 4:00 a.m.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.943
and then I passed

02:28.816 --> 02:30.943
out somewhere.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.946
Woke up... I don't know,

02:31.485 --> 02:33.946
it was like 6:30.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.530
People were still drinking.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.530
It was awesome.

02:35.614 --> 02:36.657
Had some breakfast.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.492
Then I found

02:36.740 --> 02:38.492
fucking Terry

02:38.575 --> 02:39.952
and all these

02:38.575 --> 02:39.952
awesome people

02:40.035 --> 02:41.369
and we've been

02:40.035 --> 02:41.369
fucking biking

02:41.453 --> 02:42.830
and drinking

02:41.453 --> 02:42.830
ever since!

02:44.873 --> 02:47.793
I am fucking zero

02:44.873 --> 02:47.793
impressed with you

02:44.873 --> 02:47.793
right now, Ricky.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.544
You just remember

02:47.876 --> 02:49.544
what Potsie Weber said

02:49.628 --> 02:51.630
to the rest of the

02:49.628 --> 02:51.630
band in "Happy Days":

02:51.713 --> 02:53.924
Shape up or ship out.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.175
What the fuck are

02:54.008 --> 02:56.175
you talking about?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.720
Ricky, I could be the

02:56.259 --> 02:58.720
next Garth Brooks.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.097
If you want a piece

02:58.804 --> 03:00.097
of that action,

03:00.179 --> 03:01.306
you'd better start

03:00.179 --> 03:01.306
acting like it.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.060
Especially if I'm going

03:02.850 --> 03:05.060
to be moving down here,

03:05.144 --> 03:08.313
changing my name.

03:05.144 --> 03:08.313
Get on board.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.481
Fuck do you mean,

03:08.396 --> 03:09.481
change your name?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.316
What would you

03:09.564 --> 03:11.316
change your name to?

03:11.399 --> 03:13.610
I don't know

03:11.399 --> 03:13.610
yet, but...

03:13.694 --> 03:15.863
I was thinking maybe

03:13.694 --> 03:15.863
Brock Thunder.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
(Snickering,

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
laughing)

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
Brock Thunder?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.825
Brock Thunder, man?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.825
That's fucked!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.200
That's a good

03:19.908 --> 03:21.200
country star name.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.536
It's got, like,

03:21.284 --> 03:22.536
the Brock,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.038
and then Thunder.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.038
(Imitating thunder)

03:24.121 --> 03:26.123
Bubs, that's a gay

03:24.121 --> 03:26.123
porn star name, man.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.541
Terry:

03:26.205 --> 03:27.541
Yeah, I think

03:26.205 --> 03:27.541
it already is.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.376
Haven't I seen you in

03:27.624 --> 03:29.376
one of those, big guy?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.253
Look, go fuck

03:29.459 --> 03:32.253
yourself, Terry!

03:29.459 --> 03:32.253
That's a good

03:29.459 --> 03:32.253
one, Terry.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.089
Terry, just get me to

03:32.337 --> 03:34.089
Manuel's, would you?

03:34.173 --> 03:36.133
Before I slap your tits

03:34.173 --> 03:36.133
and call you Susie.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
Ricky:

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
So it's on this

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
corner, Terry?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.224
Terry:

03:42.305 --> 03:44.224
Right there.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.144
Okay, buddy.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.144
Decent.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.188
All right.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.188
Good luck, man.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.815
No, Ricky, off

03:49.270 --> 03:51.815
the fucking bike.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.815
(Snapping fingers)

03:51.899 --> 03:53.274
I was just going

03:51.899 --> 03:53.274
to stay on here

03:53.358 --> 03:54.693
while you're in there.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.693
No,

03:54.776 --> 03:57.071
you're not drinking

03:54.776 --> 03:57.071
all fucking day.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.948
You're my assistant,

03:57.154 --> 03:59.948
so start acting like it.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.948
What...

04:00.032 --> 04:01.449
What the fuck...?

04:00.032 --> 04:01.449
Off the bike.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.952
What the fuck are

04:01.533 --> 04:03.952
you talking about?

04:04.036 --> 04:05.829
You're not getting fucking

04:04.036 --> 04:05.829
drunk all day, Ricky.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.414
If you want to be

04:05.913 --> 04:07.414
my assistant,

04:07.497 --> 04:08.916
you'd better start

04:07.497 --> 04:08.916
acting like it.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.834
Oh, really?

04:08.999 --> 04:10.834
Yeah.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.794
Mister fucking royal

04:10.918 --> 04:12.794
highness-ing now, are you?

04:12.878 --> 04:14.629
What are you going

04:12.878 --> 04:14.629
to have us do next?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.882
Fluffing your

04:14.713 --> 04:16.882
fucking cock and

04:14.713 --> 04:16.882
doing your laundry?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.134
Polishing your

04:16.965 --> 04:19.134
fucking nails?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.134
Well, maybe.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.136
Maybe, Ricky,

04:19.218 --> 04:21.136
you never know.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.721
I'm telling you, boys,

04:22.804 --> 04:24.681
when I'm sipping champagne

04:22.804 --> 04:24.681
with Ryan Seacrest,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.016
you're going to

04:24.765 --> 04:26.016
fucking thank me...

04:24.765 --> 04:26.016
Terry! Whoo!

04:26.100 --> 04:27.475
that you're part of it.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.475
Okay, all right,

04:27.559 --> 04:29.269
just remember where you

04:27.559 --> 04:29.269
came from, okay, Bubs?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.521
I know where I came from.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.521
All right, just

04:29.352 --> 04:31.521
calm it down a bit.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
Don't be fooled by

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
the rocks that I got.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.192
I'm still... I'm still

04:33.398 --> 04:35.192
Bubbles from the block.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.902
(Snapping fingers)

04:35.275 --> 04:36.902
Let's go with

04:35.275 --> 04:36.902
some cash.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.153
I don't have

04:36.985 --> 04:38.153
a lot left.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.947
Here, look, you

04:38.237 --> 04:39.947
can take that.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.281
No, I want the cash.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.741
Did you hear me

04:41.364 --> 04:42.741
say "cash"

04:42.824 --> 04:44.159
Bubs...

04:42.824 --> 04:44.159
or did you hear

04:42.824 --> 04:44.159
me say card?

04:44.243 --> 04:45.410
Listen, you're

04:44.243 --> 04:45.410
buying a suit.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.661
If you're going

04:45.493 --> 04:46.661
to buy a suit,

04:46.745 --> 04:48.080
you may as well drop

04:46.745 --> 04:48.080
400 or 500 bucks

04:48.163 --> 04:49.623
to get a nice suit.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.623
400 or 500?

04:49.706 --> 04:50.999
Yes, just throw

04:49.706 --> 04:50.999
it on the card.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.918
Alex doesn't

04:51.083 --> 04:52.918
give a fuck.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.253
He won't even

04:53.001 --> 04:54.253
notice it.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.253
All right,

04:54.335 --> 04:57.089
I'll spend 400

04:54.335 --> 04:57.089
or 500 on a suit.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.757
That's fine.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.757
All right, buddy.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.341
Well, I'm just going

04:58.840 --> 05:00.341
to have a little nap.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.969
No, Ricky...

05:00.425 --> 05:01.969
You can get

05:00.425 --> 05:01.969
your suit.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.637
Bubbles:

05:02.052 --> 05:03.637
Ricky, get... Ricky.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.639
(Sighing)

05:03.720 --> 05:05.639
You're going to

05:03.720 --> 05:05.639
work for your spot

05:05.722 --> 05:07.891
on my team, bud.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.891
What do you

05:05.722 --> 05:07.891
want us to do?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.601
Well, we're

05:07.975 --> 05:09.601
making a video.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.104
What do videos have

05:09.684 --> 05:12.104
in them, Julian?

05:12.187 --> 05:14.231
Ladies.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.231
All right, yes.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
So see if you can

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
round up some ladies.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.318
All right.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.318
And maybe a cool car

05:18.401 --> 05:20.028
that we can

05:18.401 --> 05:20.028
drive around.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.028
Oh, fuck.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.030
That'll be easy.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.030
No problem.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.030
Not a problem, man.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.074
I got it. All right,

05:22.114 --> 05:24.074
go get a nice suit.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.784
See, that's the

05:24.158 --> 05:25.784
attitude, right there.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.327
All right.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.327
Okay, buddy.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.327
There's the winning attitude

05:27.410 --> 05:28.912
that's going to get

05:27.410 --> 05:28.912
you to the top, Ricky.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.789
Okay.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.789
Get a nice

05:28.996 --> 05:30.789
suit, buddy.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.000
We'll see you in a bit.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.000
Come pick me up

05:30.872 --> 05:33.000
when you're done.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.627
Holy fuck.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.627
I kind of like

05:33.083 --> 05:35.627
the new Bubbles.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.087
No, he's a dick,

05:35.710 --> 05:37.087
but...

05:37.171 --> 05:39.464
we've got a good thing

05:37.171 --> 05:39.464
going here, probably.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.757
It's taking everything

05:39.547 --> 05:40.757
in me right now

05:40.841 --> 05:42.592
to deal with Bubbles

05:40.841 --> 05:42.592
and his bullshit,

05:42.676 --> 05:44.970
but there's one thing that

05:42.676 --> 05:44.970
Ricky doesn't understand.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.306
Alex Lifeson's name is

05:45.053 --> 05:47.306
attached to the song now.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.057
And with Alex's name

05:47.388 --> 05:49.057
attached to it,

05:49.141 --> 05:50.976
it could mean fucking

05:49.141 --> 05:50.976
millions of dollars for us.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.351
(Slurring)

05:51.059 --> 05:52.351
I'm telling you

05:51.059 --> 05:52.351
right now, man,

05:52.435 --> 05:53.979
Bubbles better change

05:52.435 --> 05:53.979
his fucking attitude.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.730
I'm not just going

05:54.062 --> 05:55.730
to be his little

05:54.062 --> 05:55.730
bitch all the time.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.107
You know what?

05:55.814 --> 05:57.107
This is shitty,

05:57.191 --> 05:58.650
but we've got to

05:57.191 --> 05:58.650
suck this up, man.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.610
Do we?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.610
Listen, we've

05:58.733 --> 06:00.610
got to focus

06:00.694 --> 06:02.612
on his career

06:00.694 --> 06:02.612
right now...

06:00.694 --> 06:02.612
Or we can go to a bar

06:02.696 --> 06:04.405
and fucking keep drinking

06:02.696 --> 06:04.405
and having a good time.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.325
I've got a wicked

06:04.489 --> 06:06.325
buzz on and Bubbles

06:04.489 --> 06:06.325
is going to ruin it.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.575
Do you think

06:06.407 --> 06:07.575
I don't want

06:07.659 --> 06:09.161
to fucking go to

06:07.659 --> 06:09.161
a bar right now?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.620
I do, but we've

06:09.244 --> 06:10.620
got to find a car,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.039
we've got to

06:10.704 --> 06:12.039
find some ladies,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.623
then we can get drunk.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
(Muttering)

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
Fuck, look at this place.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.925
(Whispering)

06:21.256 --> 06:23.925
Oh, my fuck, look

06:21.256 --> 06:23.925
at these shirts.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.929
De-cent.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.558
1,000 bucks.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.227
<i>1,000</i> bucks.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.229
Oh, Ricky would love that one.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.065
Look, it's got weed on it.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.359
Beautiful.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.693
May I help you?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.945
Hi, yes.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.945
Hi there.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.281
Uh, my name's Bubbles.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.281
Bubbles.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.242
I'm going to be a...

06:46.365 --> 06:48.242
I'm going to be a star

06:48.325 --> 06:50.744
and I was told

06:48.325 --> 06:50.744
if I'm going

06:48.325 --> 06:50.744
to be a star,

06:50.827 --> 06:52.204
this is the place

06:50.827 --> 06:52.204
I need to get a...

06:52.287 --> 06:53.705
Well, you've got

06:52.287 --> 06:53.705
the right place

06:53.788 --> 06:55.832
at the right time.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.832
Yeah?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.832
Yes, sir.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.376
Nice to meet you.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.376
Very nice meeting you.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.877
Manuel.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.877
You're Manuel?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.255
I am.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.255
Oh, my God...

06:58.960 --> 07:01.255
The only one.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.881
You made all

07:01.338 --> 07:02.881
these suits?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.091
Yes.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.301
Now, I was told

07:04.174 --> 07:06.301
that you made stuff

07:06.385 --> 07:08.678
for Johnny Cash...

07:08.762 --> 07:10.555
All his life.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.555
Elvis...

07:10.638 --> 07:13.683
Elvis.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.683
Elvis?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.683
All his life.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.683
Oh, my God.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.018
Well I'm just looking

07:13.767 --> 07:15.018
for something,

07:15.102 --> 07:17.020
you know...

07:15.102 --> 07:17.020
Well...

07:15.102 --> 07:17.020
sort of plain

07:17.104 --> 07:18.813
that I can afford.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.813
Of course.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.274
You can look around,

07:20.357 --> 07:22.525
and there's Men

07:20.357 --> 07:22.525
department right there.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.944
See all this...

07:24.027 --> 07:25.862
Oh, my God.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.862
Decent!

07:27.114 --> 07:28.740
Julian, man,

07:27.114 --> 07:28.740
this is fucked.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.159
We can't just keep

07:28.823 --> 07:31.159
walking around

07:28.823 --> 07:31.159
all fucking day

07:31.243 --> 07:33.161
trying to find a car and

07:31.243 --> 07:33.161
hoping we find a lady.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.579
We don't know where

07:33.245 --> 07:34.579
any fucking thing is.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.331
You need to come up with

07:34.662 --> 07:36.331
a better plan here, man

07:36.415 --> 07:38.083
or I'm throwing

07:36.415 --> 07:38.083
the fucking towel.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.751
All right.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.751
There's a distillery.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.502
Let's go check

07:39.834 --> 07:41.502
this out.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.502
A what?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
A distillery. They make

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
booze in distilleries.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.757
Oh yeah, now that

07:43.755 --> 07:45.757
Julian needs a drink,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.260
it's fine to stop at

07:45.840 --> 07:48.260
places, is that right?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.260
You just finished saying

07:48.343 --> 07:50.304
you don't want to walk

07:48.343 --> 07:50.304
around all fucking day.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
I don't.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
We'll ask to use their

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
fucking phone book

07:52.431 --> 07:53.890
and look something up.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.310
That's actually

07:53.974 --> 07:56.310
a good fucking idea.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.310
No shit.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.061
You know what, though?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.061
I'm having a drink.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.021
Fuck it.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.021
Well, maybe I might

07:58.145 --> 08:00.021
have a drink.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.815
Maybe I'll have two or

08:00.105 --> 08:01.815
three fucking drinks.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.358
Maybe I'll have three

08:01.898 --> 08:03.358
to five fucking drinks.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.694
Oh, my gosh.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.694
It's Johnny...

08:06.778 --> 08:09.406
(Whispering)

08:06.778 --> 08:09.406
Is that Johnny Reid.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.406
Yes.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
He's just in your

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
shop, here, shopping?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.659
So are you.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.329
Bubbles:

08:14.119 --> 08:15.329
Johnny Reid?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.788
Hey, how you doing?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.248
Reid:

08:16.871 --> 08:18.248
I'm good,

08:16.871 --> 08:18.248
how you doing?

08:18.332 --> 08:19.666
I'm all right.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.666
My name's Bubbles,

08:19.749 --> 08:21.460
I'm a huge fan.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.919
Hi, Bubbles.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.919
Johnny.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.587
Good to meet you.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.587
Hey, nice

08:23.003 --> 08:24.587
to meet you.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.423
I see you met, uh,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.423
you met my friend,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.423
Manuel?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.799
I did,

08:26.506 --> 08:27.799
I just met him.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.384
I just met him.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.384
I'm...

08:29.468 --> 08:31.052
going to be

08:29.468 --> 08:31.052
a big star,

08:31.136 --> 08:32.346
like you are,

08:31.136 --> 08:32.346
hopefully.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.638
That's what

08:32.429 --> 08:33.638
I'm trying to do.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.640
And I'm just in here

08:33.721 --> 08:35.640
looking, you know,

08:35.723 --> 08:36.891
for a suit, like, a...

08:36.975 --> 08:39.478
maybe a black sort

08:36.975 --> 08:39.478
of basic suit

08:39.560 --> 08:41.396
that I could afford.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.396
Hey, Manuel,

08:39.560 --> 08:41.396
wear black?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.357
Black, I don't

08:41.480 --> 08:43.357
think so.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.357
No, I don't think so.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
No black.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
Unless you're going

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
to preach on Sunday,

08:45.233 --> 08:49.070
but if you want a suit

08:45.233 --> 08:49.070
that will suit you,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.239
let me show it

08:49.154 --> 08:51.239
to you. Come on.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.239
Okay.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.866
What do you think?

08:52.949 --> 08:55.160
Well, I think

08:52.949 --> 08:55.160
this would be

08:55.243 --> 08:57.454
a good beginning.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.454
Oh, my God, look

08:55.243 --> 08:57.454
at that thing!

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
That's the beginning

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
and the end.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.082
(Chuckling)

08:59.122 --> 09:01.082
Oh, it's beau...

08:59.122 --> 09:01.082
I don't think

09:01.166 --> 09:03.084
I can probably

09:01.166 --> 09:03.084
afford that,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.669
but that's one of

09:03.168 --> 09:04.669
the nicest suits

09:04.752 --> 09:06.505
maybe I've ever seen...

09:04.752 --> 09:06.505
You only get

09:04.752 --> 09:06.505
one chance.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.715
One chance, man.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.715
It's a tough

09:06.587 --> 09:08.715
business.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.300
Eh, Manuel?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.300
Right on.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.551
You want to make

09:10.384 --> 09:11.551
a statement?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.136
You've got to make

09:11.634 --> 09:13.136
a statement.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.721
I guess it wouldn't

09:13.220 --> 09:14.721
hurt to try it on.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.892
Ah, man, look at the

09:16.390 --> 09:18.892
old bottles and stuff.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.894
That's pretty cool.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.562
How y'all doing?

09:20.977 --> 09:22.562
Hey, how's it

09:20.977 --> 09:22.562
going, man?

09:22.645 --> 09:24.105
Good.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.105
Can we get a couple

09:22.645 --> 09:24.105
of rum and cokes,

09:24.189 --> 09:26.149
and, uh, I need a phone

09:24.189 --> 09:26.149
book, if you've got one.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.608
All right. Uhhh,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.986
so we... we don't

09:27.692 --> 09:29.986
sell any drinks

09:30.070 --> 09:31.571
and, uh, we...

09:31.654 --> 09:33.823
we don't make any

09:31.654 --> 09:33.823
rum, unfortunately.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
We've got whiskey,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
though.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.951
All right.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.951
Uh, we do tours

09:37.035 --> 09:38.912
and tastings of

09:37.035 --> 09:38.912
this distillery.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.498
You know, it's...

09:38.995 --> 09:41.498
a historic

09:38.995 --> 09:41.498
distillery.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.167
It was started by my

09:41.581 --> 09:44.167
triple great-grandfather,

09:44.251 --> 09:45.835
shut down 'cause

09:44.251 --> 09:45.835
of Prohibition,

09:45.919 --> 09:47.712
and my brother and I

09:45.919 --> 09:47.712
have been working

09:45.919 --> 09:47.712
the last 11 years

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
to resurrect

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
the company, and

09:47.795 --> 09:49.589
we do tastings.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.299
Right on. That's perfect.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.299
All right. Okay.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.134
We're doing this,

09:51.383 --> 09:53.134
you know, documentary

09:51.383 --> 09:53.134
about whiskies

09:53.218 --> 09:55.136
from all over the world,

09:53.218 --> 09:55.136
and that's what

09:53.218 --> 09:55.136
these guys are for,

09:55.220 --> 09:56.971
so, yeah, let's get

09:55.220 --> 09:56.971
some tastings going.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.971
Awesome.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.223
Do it.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.223
Phone book?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.223
Uh,

09:58.306 --> 09:59.766
I do have to tell

09:58.306 --> 09:59.766
you, you know,

09:59.849 --> 10:02.143
that we don't allow

09:59.849 --> 10:02.143
outside food and drinks.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.644
Uh, so, you know...

10:03.728 --> 10:05.272
I-I can work on that

10:03.728 --> 10:05.272
phone book for you,

10:05.355 --> 10:07.232
All right.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.232
and, uh, then,

10:05.355 --> 10:07.232
you know,

10:07.315 --> 10:08.691
we might have to

10:07.315 --> 10:08.691
dump that...

10:07.315 --> 10:08.691
What?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.026
that cocktail

10:08.775 --> 10:10.026
of yours

10:10.110 --> 10:11.528
down the drain though.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
Well, how about

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
I just drink it?

10:13.696 --> 10:16.032
There's a bit of a

10:13.696 --> 10:16.032
continuity thing going

10:13.696 --> 10:16.032
on with the camera.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
I'll just drink it.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
I'll get that

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
phone, you know...

10:18.368 --> 10:21.037
Um...

10:21.121 --> 10:24.958
Yeah, so it's $10 for

10:21.121 --> 10:24.958
the tour and tasting,

10:25.041 --> 10:28.211
and, um, you know...

10:28.295 --> 10:29.963
$10 per person, so...

10:28.295 --> 10:29.963
There you go.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.465
Ten bucks each.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.465
All right.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.882
Thanks, man, let's

10:31.548 --> 10:32.882
get this going.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.093
We'll get it started.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.429
So, first off, we're

10:35.176 --> 10:37.429
starting with this,

10:37.512 --> 10:40.014
our GreenBrier Tennessee

10:37.512 --> 10:40.014
White Whiskey.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.433
Okay.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.433
Um...

10:41.516 --> 10:42.683
This is awesome.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.978
So this, uh...

10:45.061 --> 10:47.439
is our un-aged,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.439
Tennessee

10:45.061 --> 10:47.439
White Whiskey

10:47.522 --> 10:49.149
from my, uh...

10:49.232 --> 10:52.569
triple great-grandfather's

10:49.232 --> 10:52.569
original recipe.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.946
Nice.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.946
Umm, a kind of

10:52.652 --> 10:54.946
a piece of history

10:55.029 --> 10:57.657
and, um, you know,

10:55.029 --> 10:57.657
it's, uh...

10:55.029 --> 10:57.657
Smooth.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.951
yeah, it's

10:57.740 --> 10:59.951
pretty smooth.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.951
What were

10:57.740 --> 10:59.951
the other ones?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.370
(Whispering)

11:00.034 --> 11:02.370
Oh man... Escorts are

11:00.034 --> 11:02.370
way more expensive

11:02.454 --> 11:03.913
here than at home.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.915
How much are they?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.915
<i>Way</i> more.<i> Way</i> more.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.917
So what the fuck

11:05.999 --> 11:07.917
are we going to do?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.294
We're just going

11:08.001 --> 11:09.294
to have to think

11:08.001 --> 11:09.294
of something.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.753
We're going to have

11:09.377 --> 11:10.753
to have, like,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.671
really nice-looking

11:10.837 --> 11:12.671
girls and a shitty car

11:12.755 --> 11:13.923
or a nice-looking car

11:14.007 --> 11:16.884
and not so

11:14.007 --> 11:16.884
nice-looking women.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.972
So the next one is our

11:17.636 --> 11:20.972
Belle Meade Bourbon,

11:21.055 --> 11:24.767
uh, an award-winning

11:21.055 --> 11:24.767
bourbon that has... uh,

11:24.851 --> 11:26.645
it's a high rye

11:24.851 --> 11:26.645
content bourbon.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.895
Pretty smooth, right?

11:27.979 --> 11:29.356
"Well devout"...

11:27.979 --> 11:29.356
It's smooth,

11:29.439 --> 11:30.731
it's nice and smooth.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.731
Yeah. Uh, you know,

11:30.815 --> 11:32.192
it's, like, got

11:30.815 --> 11:32.192
an original label

11:32.275 --> 11:34.693
from over 100 years

11:32.275 --> 11:34.693
ago. And uh...

11:34.777 --> 11:36.404
It's got horses on it.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.404
Yeah, there are horses...

11:36.488 --> 11:38.448
So, actually, a funny

11:36.488 --> 11:38.448
story about the horses.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.326
Uh, this guy was

11:38.532 --> 11:41.326
named Bonnie Scotland,

11:41.409 --> 11:42.952
who was one

11:41.409 --> 11:42.952
of the founders

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
of the Northern Dancer

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
bloodline.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
And these horses

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
were studs

11:46.873 --> 11:48.958
at the Belle Meade

11:46.873 --> 11:48.958
mansion back

11:46.873 --> 11:48.958
in the day and...

11:49.042 --> 11:50.877
Ricky:

11:49.042 --> 11:50.877
Mr. Smarty Pants

11:49.042 --> 11:50.877
starts going on

11:50.960 --> 11:52.379
with the historically

11:50.960 --> 11:52.379
stuff of this

11:52.462 --> 11:53.921
and the historically

11:52.462 --> 11:53.921
stuff of that.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.590
I mean, I don't give

11:54.005 --> 11:55.590
a fuck about history.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.509
I think don't anybody

11:55.674 --> 11:57.509
does. History's dumb.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.886
...We ended up taking

11:57.592 --> 11:59.886
the names off of

11:57.592 --> 11:59.886
the label, though,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.472
because, uh,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.472
this guy's name was

11:59.969 --> 12:02.472
Brown Dick. So...

12:02.556 --> 12:03.764
Brown Dick.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.266
Wow, that's quite

12:03.848 --> 12:05.266
a handle.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.851
Nice. Let's try

12:05.350 --> 12:06.851
another one, man.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.354
All right. We got one

12:06.934 --> 12:09.354
more product for you.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.938
Uh, it our... our last one.

12:11.022 --> 12:14.359
It's a single barrel,

12:11.022 --> 12:14.359
uh, cask strength.

12:14.442 --> 12:18.154
Uh, it's...

12:14.442 --> 12:18.154
killer.

12:14.442 --> 12:18.154
Umm...

12:18.238 --> 12:20.323
Anyway. So, this one's...

12:18.238 --> 12:20.323
Be careful with this one.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.076
It's 122.3 proof.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.536
So, it's...

12:24.619 --> 12:27.788
You kind of want to just

12:24.619 --> 12:27.788
sip on it a little bit,

12:27.872 --> 12:29.290
I would recommend.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.084
You know, that's,

12:29.374 --> 12:31.084
but, you know, uhh...

12:31.167 --> 12:32.751
to each their own.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.713
Uh, 100... you know,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.713
pretty smooth for 122.3...

12:34.795 --> 12:37.840
That's got quite

12:34.795 --> 12:37.840
the snap for it.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.840
...proof, in my opinion.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.218
That is very smooth.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.218
It's just very strong.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.218
Uhh...

12:40.301 --> 12:43.263
( â™ª )

12:46.015 --> 12:48.309
(Whispering)

12:46.015 --> 12:48.309
Holy fuck!

12:49.894 --> 12:51.354
Oh, my God.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.022
I look like a star.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.816
I look like a star.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.027
Hey, what do you think?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.027
It fits pretty good.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.487
It looks amazing.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.907
(Laughs)

12:59.571 --> 13:02.907
You look like

12:59.571 --> 13:02.907
a country star.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.452
(Mumbling)

13:02.990 --> 13:05.452
Yeah, I suppose.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.452
Oh, my God.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.869
How much is it, again?

13:06.953 --> 13:11.790
With tax, that suit

13:06.953 --> 13:11.790
is $5,325.50.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.336
Five thousand...

13:15.420 --> 13:16.879
Oh, my God.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.258
Oh, my God.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.927
Umm... yeah,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.927
just, yeah...

13:23.010 --> 13:24.596
oh, that's

13:23.010 --> 13:24.596
nothing for me.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.846
That's nothing

13:24.679 --> 13:25.846
for me.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.057
Just jam it

13:25.930 --> 13:28.057
right on there.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.808
Right away,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.808
Mr. Lifeson.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.939
(Whispering)

13:32.895 --> 13:34.939
Oh my fuck, boys.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.316
Alex,

13:36.399 --> 13:38.359
if you're watching this,

13:36.399 --> 13:38.359
I swear to fuck

13:38.443 --> 13:40.069
I'm going to pay you back

13:38.443 --> 13:40.069
when I'm a star.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.197
Oh my fuck.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.659
(Mouthing silently)

13:45.742 --> 13:46.951
Well, we tried, man.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.995
I guess that means

13:47.034 --> 13:48.995
we just give up

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
and keep fucking

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
drinking.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
No, we're not

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
going to give up.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.081
We've just got to decide

13:50.747 --> 13:52.081
on whether we want

13:52.165 --> 13:54.584
really hot women

13:52.165 --> 13:54.584
or an awesome car.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.380
Together:

13:57.420 --> 13:59.380
Holy fuck!

14:00.381 --> 14:02.133
Here you go.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.133
She went through, eh?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.593
She went

14:02.216 --> 14:03.593
through.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.593
Yep.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.720
Just sign right

14:03.677 --> 14:05.720
there for me.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.720
Okay, yes.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.180
Let me just, uh...

14:07.263 --> 14:10.099
get my signature

14:07.263 --> 14:10.099
on there.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.434
Just have a look here.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.272
Alex...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.566
Lifeson. There you

14:16.356 --> 14:18.566
go, that's me.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.818
Thank you, Mr. Lifeson.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.736
Thank you for

14:19.900 --> 14:21.736
all your help.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.697
Of course.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.697
Ricky: Hey, Bubbles! Get

14:21.820 --> 14:23.697
the fuck out of here, man.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.365
Oh, there's the boys.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.616
Hey, buddy!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.034
Check out this

14:26.700 --> 14:28.034
fucking thing!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.703
Holy fuck.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.579
You rented the

14:29.786 --> 14:31.579
General Lee?

14:31.663 --> 14:34.708
We didn't ren...

14:31.663 --> 14:34.708
Yeah, we rented it.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.708
We rented it, man.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.250
Decent!

14:36.334 --> 14:38.545
Wow! Man, that's

14:36.334 --> 14:38.545
quite a suit.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.004
What do you think

14:38.628 --> 14:40.004
of that, boys?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.256
Nice.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.256
Do I look like a star?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.217
Look at that, they put

14:42.340 --> 14:44.217
my name in it, Ricky.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.261
No fucking way!

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
Star.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
Bubs, how much

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
did you rack

14:48.722 --> 14:50.306
on the credit card

14:48.722 --> 14:50.306
for that, now?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.726
Uh, it was...

14:50.390 --> 14:52.726
I don't remember.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.311
Julian:

14:52.809 --> 14:55.311
Did ya... Come on, how

14:52.809 --> 14:55.311
much did you pay for it?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.271
It was... a fair bit.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.315
Julian:

14:57.355 --> 14:59.315
Bubs, I don't give a fuck

14:57.355 --> 14:59.315
how much you spent.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.025
How much did you spend?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.025
I just want to know.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.903
Oh, little over 5,000.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.988
(Laughing)

15:03.986 --> 15:05.988
What?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.988
Five grand?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.782
You put five grand on

15:06.072 --> 15:07.782
a stolen fucking credit card?

15:07.866 --> 15:08.991
Are you nuts?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.036
That's a major fucking

15:09.576 --> 15:12.036
crime in America, man.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.330
Oh, well, Johnny Reid

15:12.119 --> 15:14.330
fucking...

15:14.414 --> 15:15.582
talked me into it.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.833
You met Johnny Reid?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.626
Should I bring it back?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.626
I would.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.878
Bubs, if you bring

15:18.710 --> 15:19.878
that back,

15:19.960 --> 15:21.128
that's when you're

15:19.960 --> 15:21.128
going to get caught.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.505
Get the fuck in the car.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.175
(Sighs)

15:23.339 --> 15:26.175
For fuck's sakes,

15:23.339 --> 15:26.175
let's just go.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.678
The General Lee!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.678
Holy fuck!

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
Bubs...

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
Duke boys!

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
There you

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
go, buddy.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
Bubs, we've

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
got five ladies

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
waiting for us

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
right now.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.726
So we've got

15:32.807 --> 15:34.726
to hurry up.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.726
Man, and they are hot!

15:34.809 --> 15:38.020
Yeah. Hop in, Ricky.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.020
Well, you...

15:38.104 --> 15:40.523
Ricky, I'm... going

15:38.104 --> 15:40.523
to ride in the front.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.400
Stars don't ride

15:40.607 --> 15:42.400
in the back, bud.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.111
Oh, man. It's got

15:42.483 --> 15:45.111
one of those cage...

15:45.194 --> 15:46.571
Julian:

15:45.194 --> 15:46.571
Ricky, just get

15:45.194 --> 15:46.571
the fuck in!

15:46.654 --> 15:48.281
Come on, Ricky.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.281
I want to drive

15:48.364 --> 15:49.824
in the front of

15:48.364 --> 15:49.824
the General Lee.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.912
I'm more like one of the

15:51.117 --> 15:53.912
Duke boys than you are.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.371
You should've

15:53.994 --> 15:55.371
backed in.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.623
Fuck!

15:58.374 --> 16:00.000
There you go.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.377
All right.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.379
Holy fuck, boys.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.715
I can't believe

16:03.463 --> 16:05.715
I'm in the General Lee.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.007
(Engine roars)

16:05.799 --> 16:07.007
Listen to that.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.802
(Engine revving)

16:07.091 --> 16:08.802
Yeah!

16:08.885 --> 16:11.178
Decent!

16:08.885 --> 16:11.178
Do a brake burn!

16:12.806 --> 16:14.390
Julian:

16:12.806 --> 16:14.390
There's your ladies, buddy.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.892
Bubbles:

16:14.474 --> 16:15.892
Oh, my God, Julian.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.437
Ricky:

16:15.975 --> 16:19.437
Awesome car and awesome ladies.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.856
Bubbles:

16:19.520 --> 16:21.856
Smokin's.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.691
Hey, ladies.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.735
This is Bubbles. He's the

16:23.775 --> 16:25.735
star of the show here today.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.320
(Laughs)

16:27.403 --> 16:28.780
Hi there.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.281
All five of us

16:28.863 --> 16:30.281
doing this guy?

16:30.364 --> 16:31.825
No, no, no.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.825
You're not doing him.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.159
You're just dancing

16:31.908 --> 16:33.159
around for this video,

16:33.242 --> 16:34.494
you know, looking

16:33.242 --> 16:34.494
sexy and stuff.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.787
Isn't that

16:34.577 --> 16:35.787
what you wanted?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
Yeah. Umm...

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
Julian?

16:37.831 --> 16:38.957
What?

16:39.039 --> 16:40.541
Did you rent ladies

16:39.039 --> 16:40.541
of the evening?

16:40.625 --> 16:41.960
Do you know

16:40.625 --> 16:41.960
how hard it is

16:42.042 --> 16:43.962
to find five hot

16:42.042 --> 16:43.962
ladies on short notice?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.463
This is the best

16:44.044 --> 16:45.463
I could do.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.632
Now, let's

16:45.546 --> 16:47.632
get this going.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.967
I don't want this

16:47.715 --> 16:48.967
to take all fucking day.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.135
Well, it might have

16:49.049 --> 16:51.135
to take all day.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.638
I'm taking my time and

16:51.218 --> 16:53.638
I'm getting this right.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.557
Bubs, they're on the

16:53.721 --> 16:56.557
clock. Get this going!

16:56.641 --> 16:57.851
(Sighs)

16:57.934 --> 17:00.019
Hey, ladies.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.019
How you doing?

17:00.102 --> 17:01.646
So, yeah, this is

17:00.102 --> 17:01.646
just a music video.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.147
There's no dirty stuff.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.858
I'm going to be out

17:03.230 --> 17:04.858
in the front here.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.400
I'll have my

17:04.941 --> 17:06.400
guitar, singing.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.194
And you guys can

17:06.484 --> 17:08.194
just... you know,

17:08.277 --> 17:10.279
dance around,

17:08.277 --> 17:10.279
looking sexy,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.198
you know how they do it

17:10.363 --> 17:12.198
in country videos.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.867
This is a big

17:12.281 --> 17:13.867
country video.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.911
Ricky, Julian, I need you

17:13.950 --> 17:16.911
in the General Lee, there,

17:16.995 --> 17:19.163
doing donuts and brake burns

17:16.995 --> 17:19.163
and stuff right behind me.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.915
Yeeeah!

17:19.246 --> 17:20.915
Good idea!

17:20.999 --> 17:23.083
I'm going to try to get

17:20.999 --> 17:23.083
that in slow motion.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.420
Camera fella, I'm going to

17:23.167 --> 17:26.420
need high angle music video...

17:26.504 --> 17:28.464
type shots, so

17:26.504 --> 17:28.464
don't fuck that up.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.257
Yeah, did you hear that?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.257
Don't fuck it up, okay?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.218
Ricky!

17:30.341 --> 17:32.218
Ricky! Stop

17:30.341 --> 17:32.218
fucking around.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.595
And then after that, we're

17:32.301 --> 17:34.595
going to shoot one scene,

17:34.679 --> 17:36.055
you know,

17:34.679 --> 17:36.055
washing the car.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.390
You guys will be

17:36.138 --> 17:37.390
in bikinis.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.183
Julian, I'm...

17:39.266 --> 17:40.977
going to need you

17:39.266 --> 17:40.977
to get shirtless

17:39.266 --> 17:40.977
for that scene,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.896
'cause I want you to

17:41.060 --> 17:42.896
look like a sexy cowboy.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.522
That's not going to happen.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.357
Oh, it is going to happen.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.357
It's not happening.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.942
Because this is

17:46.440 --> 17:47.942
my fucking video,

17:48.026 --> 17:50.194
I'm calling the shots

17:48.026 --> 17:50.194
and you do what I say.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.905
(Scoffs)

17:50.277 --> 17:51.905
Let's get this

17:50.277 --> 17:51.905
going, then.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.449
Okay.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.449
Ricky:

17:53.489 --> 17:55.449
No, no, no, no, man.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.993
You drove the fucking

17:55.533 --> 17:56.993
thing here.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.411
I want a turn in

17:57.076 --> 17:58.411
this cocksucker.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.413
Ricky... All right, you

17:58.494 --> 18:00.413
do the shirtless scene

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
as the cowboy and

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
you can drive.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.375
Okay, ladies,

18:02.248 --> 18:04.375
so just, you know,

18:04.458 --> 18:06.210
as sexy as

18:04.458 --> 18:06.210
you can be.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.295
Ricky, Julian,

18:06.293 --> 18:08.295
you do your burn-outs.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.924
Cameraman, I need

18:08.379 --> 18:10.924
some snap zooms,

18:11.007 --> 18:12.258
like they do in

18:11.007 --> 18:12.258
the music video.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.218
Sound guy,

18:12.341 --> 18:14.218
don't fuck this up,

18:14.301 --> 18:16.470
camera fella,

18:14.301 --> 18:16.470
make sure you...

18:16.554 --> 18:19.057
Okay, you got a good angle

18:16.554 --> 18:19.057
there, it looks like.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.350
Okay, this is Bubbles'

18:19.139 --> 18:21.350
"Who's Got Yer Belly?"

18:21.434 --> 18:22.936
Take one, here we go.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.896
Mark it!

18:23.019 --> 18:24.896
(Hand clap)

18:24.979 --> 18:26.856
Hit the music there, fella.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.148
( â™ª )

18:28.232 --> 18:29.358
(Tires screeching)

18:29.442 --> 18:32.111
( â™ª )

18:41.495 --> 18:45.165
â™ª Well, the word on the street,

18:41.495 --> 18:45.165
I heard somebody say â™ª

18:45.249 --> 18:47.668
â™ª Is you had a real

18:45.249 --> 18:47.668
shit turd of a day â™ª

18:47.752 --> 18:51.213
â™ª So I looked in my pocket

18:47.752 --> 18:51.213
and guess what I found â™ª

18:51.297 --> 18:54.258
â™ª Ten digits just a-waitin'

18:51.297 --> 18:54.258
there to take you to town â™ª

18:54.341 --> 18:57.595
â™ª I got a five-finger discount

18:54.341 --> 18:57.595
coming your way â™ª

18:57.678 --> 19:00.681
â™ª I'm a fingerball wizard,

18:57.678 --> 19:00.681
I just give it away â™ª

19:00.765 --> 19:01.933
(Siren blaring)

19:02.016 --> 19:03.183
For fuck's sakes!

19:03.267 --> 19:04.644
Julian: Fuck!

19:03.267 --> 19:04.644
Ricky: Fuck!

19:04.727 --> 19:06.353
Julian:

19:04.727 --> 19:06.353
Bubs, get in!

19:06.437 --> 19:08.397
Let's just tell

19:06.437 --> 19:08.397
them we're shooting

19:06.437 --> 19:08.397
a music video.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.274
We didn't rent

19:08.481 --> 19:10.274
this thing. Get in!

19:10.357 --> 19:12.192
You fucking stole it?

19:10.357 --> 19:12.192
Julian:

19:10.357 --> 19:12.192
Get the fuck in!

19:12.276 --> 19:13.736
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

19:12.276 --> 19:13.736
Preston, take my guitar!

19:13.820 --> 19:15.696
Ricky:

19:13.820 --> 19:15.696
Let's go! Come on, come on!

19:15.780 --> 19:18.074
Julian:

19:15.780 --> 19:18.074
For fuck's sakes!

19:15.780 --> 19:18.074
Fuck, please go!

19:18.157 --> 19:21.077
(Siren continues wailing)

19:21.160 --> 19:23.830
(Engine roaring, siren blaring)

19:29.585 --> 19:31.963
I can't believe you guys

19:29.585 --> 19:31.963
stole the fucking car.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.213
What else were

19:32.046 --> 19:33.213
we going to do?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.632
Do you know

19:33.297 --> 19:34.632
how much it cost?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.926
You need, fucking...

19:34.715 --> 19:36.926
a credit card.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.470
You need fucking

19:37.010 --> 19:39.470
your driver's license.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.723
Insurance.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.723
It was either

19:39.553 --> 19:42.723
a fucking nice car

19:42.807 --> 19:45.768
and no fucking nice

19:42.807 --> 19:45.768
women, or nice women

19:42.807 --> 19:45.768
and a shitty car

19:45.852 --> 19:48.104
and we're just trying

19:45.852 --> 19:48.104
to fucking do the right

19:45.852 --> 19:48.104
thing for you, Bubs.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.647
Did we come through

19:48.187 --> 19:49.647
with the ladies?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.691
Yes, we did.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.691
And the car.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.691
Look at this car.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.151
The video's going

19:51.774 --> 19:53.151
to be awesome.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.235
(Siren blaring)

19:53.233 --> 19:55.235
If we don't go to jail.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.113
I wonder what they're having

19:55.319 --> 19:57.113
for dinner in jail tonight.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.489
We're not going

19:57.196 --> 19:58.489
to go to jail.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.825
Ricky's going to

19:58.572 --> 20:00.825
fucking lose this guy.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.243
Bubbles:

20:00.908 --> 20:03.243
We're doing a great job, he's

20:00.908 --> 20:03.243
fucking four feet behind us.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.954
Hold on to your cocks,

20:03.327 --> 20:04.954
boys. I'm going

20:03.327 --> 20:04.954
to try something.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.747
He's going to do

20:05.038 --> 20:06.747
a pit manoeuvre on us.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.749
Well, he's fucking stupid,

20:06.831 --> 20:08.749
like most of the cops.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.126
Julian:

20:08.833 --> 20:10.126
For fuck's sakes.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.045
Oh, you think I'm

20:10.209 --> 20:12.045
going this way?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.754
Think I'm going this

20:12.128 --> 20:13.754
way? No, I'm not.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.754
I'm going this way.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.381
Ricky!

20:13.838 --> 20:15.381
(Laughs)

20:13.838 --> 20:15.381
Go, man, go!

20:15.464 --> 20:18.134
Ricky:

20:15.464 --> 20:18.134
All right. Did we

20:15.464 --> 20:18.134
lose him there, Bubs?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.969
Bubbles:

20:18.217 --> 20:19.969
What do you think, Ricky?

20:20.053 --> 20:22.013
Holy fuck!

20:20.053 --> 20:22.013
He's a cop. He's

20:20.053 --> 20:22.013
trained to drive

20:22.096 --> 20:23.848
at high speeds.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.848
So am I.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.142
He doesn't have

20:23.931 --> 20:26.142
a fucking buzz on

20:23.931 --> 20:26.142
right now and I do,

20:26.225 --> 20:27.643
so we're going

20:26.225 --> 20:27.643
to be great here.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.812
That's a great theory.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.812
Yeah, great theory.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.438
Great fucking

20:29.896 --> 20:31.438
theory, Ricky.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
What are the laws

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
like down here?

20:33.357 --> 20:35.776
Maybe it's not even

20:33.357 --> 20:35.776
that illegal to

20:33.357 --> 20:35.776
steal a fucking car.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.778
It's<i> highly</i> illegal.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.778
You're fucked. You're

20:35.860 --> 20:37.778
going to jail, Rick.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.489
For fuck's sakes.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.783
Do you know what

20:40.573 --> 20:42.783
the jail's like

20:40.573 --> 20:42.783
down here, Julian?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.702
They're fucked

20:42.867 --> 20:44.702
down here!

20:44.785 --> 20:47.080
In Tennessee, Ricky,

20:47.163 --> 20:48.455
it's not like

20:47.163 --> 20:48.455
it is at home.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.416
The jails here are real.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.376
It's fucking hard

20:50.499 --> 20:52.376
enough to get dope

20:50.499 --> 20:52.376
on the outside.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
It's probably

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
real hard to get

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
dope in jail here.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.255
That's what

20:54.545 --> 20:56.255
you're worried about?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
Where you're going

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
to get fucking dope

20:56.338 --> 20:58.465
in jail?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.342
Oh. I don't know

20:58.549 --> 21:00.342
if I can get us

20:58.549 --> 21:00.342
out of this.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.095
This guy's

21:00.426 --> 21:02.095
fucking good.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.512
For fuck's sakes!

21:03.596 --> 21:04.764
Ricky:

21:03.596 --> 21:04.764
Let's see what she can do.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.766
Holy fuck, boys,

21:04.847 --> 21:06.766
this car is fast!

21:06.849 --> 21:08.392
No wonder the Luke boys

21:06.849 --> 21:08.392
got away so much,

21:08.475 --> 21:10.519
this car is awesome!

21:10.603 --> 21:12.188
Ricky, that

21:10.603 --> 21:12.188
was fucking...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.065
a TV show!

21:14.148 --> 21:15.315
For fuck's sakes!

21:15.399 --> 21:16.692
I wonder if

21:15.399 --> 21:16.692
that's Rosco,

21:16.776 --> 21:18.111
that'd be

21:16.776 --> 21:18.111
fucking badass.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.113
In the fucking Lee,

21:18.194 --> 21:20.113
getting chased by Rosco?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.655
Are you kidding me?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.655
It's not, Ricky.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.532
Rosco is not real.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.617
And he's dead.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.702
Ricky:

21:25.118 --> 21:26.702
You guys are fucked in the head.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.579
I just was watching him

21:26.786 --> 21:28.579
in the Luke boys last week.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.456
Holy fuck.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.456
Boys, we've got

21:28.662 --> 21:30.456
to find a

21:28.662 --> 21:30.456
fucking creek

21:30.539 --> 21:32.291
where the

21:30.539 --> 21:32.291
bridge is out.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.210
I've got to jump

21:32.374 --> 21:34.210
this fucking thing

21:32.374 --> 21:34.210
and get away.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.586
It's the only

21:34.293 --> 21:35.586
fucking hope.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.586
We're not

21:34.293 --> 21:35.586
jumping us

21:35.669 --> 21:37.046
over a fucking creek,

21:35.669 --> 21:37.046
you idiot!

21:37.130 --> 21:38.672
We have to do something.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.672
We're not doing that.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.216
We'll fucking die!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.842
Ricky:

21:40.299 --> 21:41.842
Let me try some

21:40.299 --> 21:41.842
other moves here.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.136
We'll fucking see

21:41.926 --> 21:43.136
how stupid Rosco is.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.845
(Tires screeching)

21:44.929 --> 21:46.597
Bubbles:

21:44.929 --> 21:46.597
Okay, Ricky, he's

21:44.929 --> 21:46.597
way back there.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.307
Ricky:

21:46.680 --> 21:48.307
Oh, I know what to do, boys.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.934
This always fucking works.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.351
Bubbles:

21:50.017 --> 21:51.351
Fuck, Ricky.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.271
Ricky:

21:51.435 --> 21:53.271
This'll be perfect.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.648
Bubbles:

21:53.353 --> 21:55.648
My God, this is an actual

21:53.353 --> 21:55.648
Duke boys manoeuvre!

21:55.731 --> 21:58.109
(Whispering)

21:55.731 --> 21:58.109
Fucking crazy. Listen.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.444
(Wails of siren getting closer)

21:58.192 --> 22:00.444
We're so getting

21:58.192 --> 22:00.444
caught, boys.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.405
(Siren blaring)

22:04.949 --> 22:07.118
(Door handle clicks)

22:04.949 --> 22:07.118
I think it worked.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.039
(Laughs)

22:12.123 --> 22:14.125
It fucking totally worked, boys!

22:14.208 --> 22:16.043
Holy fuck!

22:14.208 --> 22:16.043
No fucking way!

22:16.127 --> 22:17.795
Ricky:

22:16.127 --> 22:17.795
Right, let's

22:16.127 --> 22:17.795
grab our shit

22:17.878 --> 22:19.797
and get the fuck

22:17.878 --> 22:19.797
out of here.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.797
Yeah, let's go, boys.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.799
Let's get

22:19.880 --> 22:21.799
in the woods.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.799
You fucking did it, Ricky!

22:21.882 --> 22:23.759
Holy fuck!

22:23.843 --> 22:25.511
(Birds chirping)

22:25.594 --> 22:29.765
(Drunkenly)

22:25.594 --> 22:29.765
â™ª Like a drunk-as-fuck

22:25.594 --> 22:29.765
cowhole... â™ª

22:29.849 --> 22:31.767
Ricky,

22:31.851 --> 22:33.853
if you're going to

22:31.851 --> 22:33.853
sing fucking legendary

22:31.851 --> 22:33.853
country songs,

22:33.936 --> 22:35.229
learn the fucking

22:33.936 --> 22:35.229
words, would you?

22:35.313 --> 22:36.647
Fuck, boys.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.232
Too much walking,

22:36.730 --> 22:38.232
walking.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.234
No resting, resting.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.653
I need to fucking

22:40.318 --> 22:42.653
lay down for

22:40.318 --> 22:42.653
a few minutes.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.530
Bubbles:

22:42.736 --> 22:44.530
Ricky, get up.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.073
Ricky:

22:44.613 --> 22:46.073
I'm not getting up.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.491
Julian, fucking

22:46.157 --> 22:47.491
deal with it.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.491
Do your job.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.451
I'm dealing

22:47.574 --> 22:49.451
with it, Bubs.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.451
Do your job.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.369
Julian:

22:49.535 --> 22:51.369
Get up. Get up. Let's go.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.289
Ugh, fuck, boys!

22:53.371 --> 22:56.125
Do we even have

22:53.371 --> 22:56.125
a fucking plan, here?

22:56.209 --> 22:58.711
I don't know, Ricky.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.711
I guess we just wander

22:58.794 --> 23:02.089
down this fucking

22:58.794 --> 23:02.089
desolate road.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.051
Me in a $5,000

23:02.173 --> 23:05.051
fucking suit,

23:05.134 --> 23:07.678
with absolutely

23:05.134 --> 23:07.678
no footage of it

23:05.134 --> 23:07.678
on camera

23:07.761 --> 23:09.805
to fucking show

23:07.761 --> 23:09.805
in my music video.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.099
We almost got that video shot.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.310
Ricky, we didn't

23:12.183 --> 23:14.310
get any of it shot,

23:14.392 --> 23:16.229
'cause of you two dickweeds.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.064
Stealing fucking cars,

23:18.147 --> 23:19.606
and not taking this serious.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.984
You know what, boys?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.984
You know what?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.236
As of right now...

23:24.695 --> 23:26.613
your positions are

23:24.695 --> 23:26.613
officially terminated.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.115
(Laughs)

23:26.697 --> 23:28.115
What the fuck?

23:28.199 --> 23:29.367
What?

23:28.199 --> 23:29.367
You're firing us?

23:29.449 --> 23:30.617
Yeah, do you need

23:29.449 --> 23:30.617
a pink slip

23:30.701 --> 23:32.828
written out

23:30.701 --> 23:32.828
for you there?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.080
Listen here, Mister...

23:32.912 --> 23:34.080
You're done.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.789
Listen here,

23:34.163 --> 23:35.789
Mr. Bigshot.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.084
I've been biting

23:35.873 --> 23:38.084
my tongue this

23:35.873 --> 23:38.084
entire fucking trip

23:38.167 --> 23:39.835
because I believe

23:38.167 --> 23:39.835
in you, man.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.295
In case you

23:39.919 --> 23:41.295
haven't noticed,

23:41.379 --> 23:42.755
we've been bending over

23:41.379 --> 23:42.755
backwards for you.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.632
I've... I'm not

23:43.547 --> 23:45.632
a good bender-over

23:45.716 --> 23:47.051
but you know

23:45.716 --> 23:47.051
what I mean...

23:47.134 --> 23:49.303
Bubs, what I'm

23:47.134 --> 23:49.303
trying to say, man,

23:49.387 --> 23:50.888
I'm not doing this

23:49.387 --> 23:50.888
for the money.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.848
Oh.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.848
I'm not doing

23:50.971 --> 23:52.848
this for the money!

23:52.932 --> 23:54.516
For the bags of money

23:52.932 --> 23:54.516
I'm going to be making?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.102
I'm doing this

23:54.600 --> 23:56.102
because I believe

23:54.600 --> 23:56.102
in you, man,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.395
and because I love you!

23:58.271 --> 23:59.605
Okay?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.565
Hmmm...

23:59.688 --> 24:01.565
I love you, too.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.776
Not once have

24:01.648 --> 24:03.776
I thought about

24:01.648 --> 24:03.776
fucking money.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.278
I heard that

24:03.859 --> 24:05.278
song, man.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.363
I know you're going

24:05.361 --> 24:07.363
to be a hit.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.614
I believe in you.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.991
You still give us

24:08.697 --> 24:10.991
food and dope

24:11.075 --> 24:12.868
and liquor and...

24:12.952 --> 24:14.745
socks. So...

24:12.952 --> 24:14.745
What do you

24:12.952 --> 24:14.745
think, Ricky?

24:14.828 --> 24:16.872
You think if I was making

24:14.828 --> 24:16.872
Garth Brooks money,

24:16.956 --> 24:20.751
I wouldn't have you sleeping

24:16.956 --> 24:20.751
on a big fucking bed of weed

24:20.834 --> 24:22.920
and all the finest liquors

24:20.834 --> 24:22.920
of the world around?

24:23.003 --> 24:24.338
Ricky:

24:23.003 --> 24:24.338
Right on, buddy.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.257
I would have that

24:24.422 --> 24:26.257
for you in a second.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.258
You know that.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.969
I love you guys.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.553
Julian:

24:30.052 --> 24:31.553
We love you, too, man.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.556
Look, boys,

24:32.346 --> 24:34.556
you know what?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.017
I'll try to keep

24:34.640 --> 24:37.017
my ego in check, okay?

24:37.101 --> 24:38.894
It's just, I got

24:37.101 --> 24:38.894
the suit on and,

24:38.978 --> 24:41.355
you know, people

24:38.978 --> 24:41.355
telling me they

24:38.978 --> 24:41.355
like my music,

24:41.439 --> 24:43.816
all of a sudden

24:41.439 --> 24:43.816
your head starts,

24:41.439 --> 24:43.816
you know...

24:43.899 --> 24:45.901
So if that

24:43.899 --> 24:45.901
happens again,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.694
you have every

24:45.985 --> 24:47.694
right, you say,

24:47.778 --> 24:49.571
"Bubbles,

24:47.778 --> 24:49.571
you're being a

24:47.778 --> 24:49.571
fucking dickweed.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.907
Sit down,"

24:49.655 --> 24:51.907
and give me a

24:49.655 --> 24:51.907
reality check.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.326
Okay?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.328
I mean, I didn't

24:53.409 --> 24:55.328
understand every

24:53.409 --> 24:55.328
word,

24:55.411 --> 24:57.663
but what I didn't,

24:55.411 --> 24:57.663
he can take care

24:55.411 --> 24:57.663
of, so...

24:57.746 --> 25:00.707
I got you, man,

24:57.746 --> 25:00.707
I got you. Right on.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.961
Okay. So where do

25:00.791 --> 25:03.961
we head to next?

25:04.044 --> 25:07.006
Well, the only

25:04.044 --> 25:07.006
plane tickets

25:04.044 --> 25:07.006
left in the case

25:04.044 --> 25:07.006
are for L.A.,

25:07.089 --> 25:08.506
so we're going

25:07.089 --> 25:08.506
to L.A., I guess.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.550
All right.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.550
Louisiana!

25:10.634 --> 25:12.552
No, Ricky. Los Angeles.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.096
Okay, this is what

25:12.636 --> 25:14.096
we're going to do.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.889
We're going to get back

25:14.180 --> 25:15.889
on track with these tasks

25:15.973 --> 25:17.557
and Swearnet and

25:15.973 --> 25:17.557
all that shit

25:17.641 --> 25:19.268
and we're going

25:17.641 --> 25:19.268
to make some money.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.354
We've got one last

25:19.352 --> 25:21.354
shot here, boys.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.938
Let's fucking do it!

25:21.437 --> 25:22.938
You guys want

25:21.437 --> 25:22.938
to do it?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.190
Fuck, yeah!

25:23.022 --> 25:24.190
Let's do it.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.565
Yes, I wanna do it.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.318
(Clears throat)

25:25.649 --> 25:27.318
All right.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.362
Team's back.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.612
Team.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.323
Ricky, get your greasy,

25:32.406 --> 25:34.741
fucking liquor-covered

25:32.406 --> 25:34.741
body off my threads.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.243
Holy fuck!

25:34.825 --> 25:36.243
Sorry, man!

25:36.327 --> 25:37.786
You're being

25:36.327 --> 25:37.786
a dick again, already.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.414
(Sighs)

25:40.498 --> 25:42.875
Sorry.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.875
Come on, Ricky.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.875
Hug away, bud.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.084
Are you sure, man?

25:45.169 --> 25:46.337
All right.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.337
Hug away.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.754
Thanks.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.257
It's going to be okay.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.510
Julian:

25:50.341 --> 25:52.510
Ricky, you're drooling on him.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.886
Just a bit

25:52.592 --> 25:53.886
of love drool.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.098
It's not going

25:56.680 --> 25:58.098
to stain.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.477
Where the fuck

25:59.683 --> 26:01.477
are we?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.104
Boys, I'm starting

26:02.769 --> 26:04.104
to get scared.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.607
The main road's

26:06.357 --> 26:07.607
up this way.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.443
Are there animals

26:07.691 --> 26:09.443
out here?

26:09.527 --> 26:10.861
Yeah, they got

26:09.527 --> 26:10.861
wild boars.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.570
Oh, my fuck!

26:12.654 --> 26:14.365
What if we get

26:12.654 --> 26:14.365
fucked by boars?

26:14.448 --> 26:16.242
We're not going to

26:14.448 --> 26:16.242
get fucked by boars.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.951
They'll just bite us,

26:16.325 --> 26:17.951
they won't fuck us.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.662
I was thinking

26:18.035 --> 26:20.662
wild whores.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.122
That'd be nice.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.502
I wouldn't mind getting

26:23.290 --> 26:26.502
jacked by a wild whore.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.880
( â™ª )

27:56.258 --> 28:01.096
(Seabirds squawking)

28:11.023 --> 28:15.444
Fishes:

28:11.023 --> 28:15.444
Oh fuck! Fuck!

28:11.023 --> 28:15.444
Fuck off! Fuck!...

28:15.528 --> 28:18.364
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

28:21.867 --> 28:23.243
(Whisper)

28:21.867 --> 28:23.243
<i>Fuck.</i>

28:23.327 --> 28:25.538
(Light clicks off)

28:23.327 --> 28:25.538
<i>Fuck off.</i>
