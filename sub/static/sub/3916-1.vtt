00:00.447 --> 00:03.049
And now all I feel is worried

00:03.083 --> 00:05.084
about everything, including my marriage.

00:05.119 --> 00:06.252
So you can go on the tour.

00:06.287 --> 00:08.788
But I want to go to
Idyllwild, if I can get in.

00:08.822 --> 00:10.657
I'm withdrawing my suit for custody.

00:10.691 --> 00:11.691
Stef: We can adopt you right away.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.593
We kissed. And now we're like...

00:13.627 --> 00:15.361
More than friends?

00:15.396 --> 00:17.430
Wyatt, please don't tell me you're
acting like this because we broke up.

00:17.464 --> 00:19.065
What the hell do you care?

00:19.099 --> 00:21.100
You should be with your family,
Ana, so should your child.

00:21.135 --> 00:22.802
Jesus: I think Ana wants to keep the baby.

00:22.836 --> 00:24.804
But I think the only reason
she isn't is because of you.

00:24.838 --> 00:26.673
Have you thought

00:26.707 --> 00:28.641
about keeping the baby? I think you should.

00:28.676 --> 00:30.810
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I think the baby is coming.

No.

He might think it's too early,

Hi, love. How are you?

03:45.887 --> 03:47.621
How's Flintwood treating you?

- Let me talk to him.
- Hold on.

Okay, hold on, hold on.
Mama wants to say hi.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.627
Really, woman?

03:53.661 --> 03:55.595
Hey, Bubba. So how's the first week been?

03:55.630 --> 03:57.698
Mama's talking to your brother.

03:57.732 --> 03:59.800
Hey, Jesus,

03:59.834 --> 04:01.902
where are those headphones that
you borrowed before you left?

04:01.936 --> 04:03.970
Well, you're gonna have to mail them back.

04:04.005 --> 04:05.972
Are you serious? You get a padded envelope

04:06.007 --> 04:07.974
and then you just write our address on it.

04:08.009 --> 04:09.810
You do know our address, right?

04:09.844 --> 04:11.912
And then you stamp it and then
you just drop it in the mail.

04:11.946 --> 04:14.715
God, I seriously wonder how
you even function sometimes.

04:14.749 --> 04:16.916
- Mariana, be nice.
- What? He took my good headphones.

04:16.951 --> 04:18.851
- I think you'll survive.
- 'Morning.

04:18.886 --> 04:20.786
Hey, are you excited about the first day?

04:20.822 --> 04:22.923
Uh, yeah, if I ever get there.

04:22.957 --> 04:25.726
I just looked online and there's
a freaking traffic jam on the 5.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.627
I wish I didn't have to commute.

04:27.662 --> 04:29.596
Well, we wish you had
told us you wanted to go

04:29.630 --> 04:31.631
before the dorms got full.
Can't have everything.

04:31.666 --> 04:32.899
Brandon, did you get the oil checked

04:32.934 --> 04:34.668
in the car, like we asked you to yesterday?

04:34.702 --> 04:36.536
- Yes, it's fine.
- Okay, drive safe.

04:36.571 --> 04:38.638
- Promise.
- We're so proud of you,

04:38.673 --> 04:39.940

04:39.974 --> 04:43.577

music school in the country.

04:43.647 --> 04:44.981
Okay, okay, I gotta go,
or I'm gonna be late.

04:45.015 --> 04:46.983
- Okay, drive safe.
- Yes, you said that.

04:51.889 --> 04:53.823
We can't live in fear, okay?

04:56.360 --> 04:58.594
Oh, first day of summer school.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.396
- Who's excited?
- Stef: I am.

05:00.431 --> 05:02.298
Mariana: Okay, look, I have to go.

05:02.332 --> 05:03.366
I have to get to Ana's.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.269
She's not great, but she's getting better.

05:06.303 --> 05:08.971
Look, I really have to go, Jesus.

05:09.006 --> 05:10.139
I keep forgetting to tell you

05:10.174 --> 05:12.008
that your independent
study at the drop-in center

05:12.042 --> 05:13.609
has been approved by the teacher board.

05:13.644 --> 05:14.977
- Oh, good.
- So just think,

05:15.012 --> 05:16.813
you get that done, you pass history

05:16.847 --> 05:18.448
and you will be all caught up

05:18.482 --> 05:20.249
and you can graduate on
time, with your class.

05:20.284 --> 05:21.617
It's almost like I'm a normal teenager.

05:21.652 --> 05:24.320
- Normal is overrated.
- You know what I mean.

05:24.354 --> 05:26.189
Yes, so now you just have to decide...

05:26.223 --> 05:27.990
What to write my paper on, I know.

05:28.025 --> 05:29.992
Hey, look, Callie wants to talk to you.

05:30.027 --> 05:31.961
(Whispers) Talk to him.

05:33.197 --> 05:35.064
Hey, dude. How's it going?

05:35.098 --> 05:36.999
Okay, I have to get to Victor and Elena's.

05:37.034 --> 05:38.935
- I love you guys.
- Love you too.

05:38.969 --> 05:40.736
Callie: Awesome. Yeah.

05:40.771 --> 05:43.473
You think we made a mistake,
letting her play nursemaid and all?

05:43.507 --> 05:45.374
I don't think we really had a choice.

05:45.409 --> 05:47.276
Mike: Hey.

05:47.311 --> 05:49.111
Mariana let me in. You ready?

05:49.146 --> 05:50.379
Yeah. We're gonna go

05:50.414 --> 05:52.849
talk to the man who owns the truck.

05:52.883 --> 05:54.784
Okay, well, didn't the
detectives do that already?

05:54.818 --> 05:56.786
Yeah, but we just...

05:56.820 --> 05:58.054
Stef, can I talk to you for a second?

05:58.088 --> 06:00.523
Callie: How's that going?

06:00.557 --> 06:01.858
Oh, yeah?

06:01.892 --> 06:04.327
Do you really think you
should be investigating this?

06:04.361 --> 06:06.395
I mean, you're awfully
close to it, you know?

06:06.430 --> 06:08.431
Do you not want to catch this guy, honey...

06:08.465 --> 06:11.033
you know, this person
that pulled a hit-and-run

06:11.068 --> 06:12.134
on our kids? They could have died.

06:12.169 --> 06:13.903
Of course I want him caught, honey,

06:13.937 --> 06:15.137
but that's not what I'm talking about.

06:15.172 --> 06:16.706
Do you not understand

06:16.740 --> 06:18.641
why people run from the
scene of an accident?

06:18.675 --> 06:20.543
It's because they're high or they're drunk

06:20.577 --> 06:23.279
or they are wanted for
another crime already.

06:23.313 --> 06:24.614
This could happen to someone else,

06:24.648 --> 06:26.282
another family. Is that okay with you?

06:26.316 --> 06:28.017
No, of course it's not okay.

06:28.051 --> 06:30.152
Okay, well, it's been three
weeks since this has happened

06:30.187 --> 06:31.854
and we've got nothing.

06:31.889 --> 06:34.056
The case is gonna be closed if
something doesn't break soon.

06:35.659 --> 06:36.859
Okay.

06:36.894 --> 06:38.761
Okay.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.429
Callie: Yeah.

06:40.464 --> 06:42.632
- Mike.
- Yeah.

06:42.666 --> 06:45.134
(Phone bleeps)

06:45.168 --> 06:46.302
Callie: Nice.

06:48.372 --> 06:50.006
Yeah, sure.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.041
You have to come back for my adoption.

06:52.075 --> 06:54.844
I don't know. A few weeks.
Maybe, like, a month.

06:54.878 --> 06:56.512
Promise?

06:56.547 --> 06:58.481
Okay. All right, bye.

06:58.515 --> 07:00.583
That is, without a doubt,

07:00.617 --> 07:02.552
the longest conversation we've ever had.

07:03.186 --> 07:05.087
Okay, I gotta go.

07:05.122 --> 07:06.355
I'm meeting Connor before class.

07:06.390 --> 07:09.091
Oh, hey, have you and Connor decided

07:09.126 --> 07:10.993
what you're gonna do at school?

07:11.028 --> 07:12.828
Are you gonna tell people or... ?

07:12.863 --> 07:14.030
Um, I don't know.

07:14.064 --> 07:15.898
We haven't really talked about it.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.634
Well, don't you think you
should, Bub... talk about it?

07:18.669 --> 07:21.604
You know, whatever you decide,
we've got your back, right?

07:23.640 --> 07:26.509
I don't know. What do you think?

07:26.599 --> 07:28.467
I mean, I already told my dad.

07:28.501 --> 07:32.204
And he's, like, the
scariest person for me, so...

07:32.238 --> 07:34.740
I don't think we should.

07:34.774 --> 07:36.675
Really?

07:36.709 --> 07:37.876
Why not?

07:37.910 --> 07:39.711
It's just...

07:39.746 --> 07:41.847
it's nobody's business, you know?

07:41.881 --> 07:44.316
(School bell rings)

07:46.686 --> 07:49.354
Brother man, brother
man, you got some change?

07:49.389 --> 07:51.289
Got a nice jacket.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.225
Excuse me, Miss, you got some change?

07:53.259 --> 07:55.260
- You got any change?
- No.

07:55.294 --> 07:57.262
Okay, Princess, thanks.

07:57.296 --> 08:00.198
I'm sorry to bother you. You go
on back to your privileged life.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.834
You don't know me, okay? You
don't know anything about me.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.102
- Oh, you want to bet?
- Yeah.

08:04.137 --> 08:06.738
Hey, get out of here.
You, leave that girl alone.

08:06.773 --> 08:08.674
- Don't you talk to me like...
- I'll get up on you.

08:08.708 --> 08:11.576
I ain't doing nothing,
man. This is a free country.

08:11.611 --> 08:14.346
I don't even know why we have
weather people in San Diego.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.181
Maybe you could become one of those,

08:16.215 --> 08:17.416
when you're better.

08:17.450 --> 08:20.052
I mean, how hard could it be?

08:20.086 --> 08:21.920
(Baby fussing)

08:21.954 --> 08:23.889
I'll get her.

08:26.626 --> 08:29.494
Hi, girl. Hungry?

08:29.529 --> 08:31.396
Do you want to try breastfeeding her?

08:31.431 --> 08:33.631
Oh, no, there's no
point, not with the brace.

08:33.666 --> 08:36.001
I can't get her in the right position.

08:36.034 --> 08:37.969
I pumped earlier. It's in the fridge.

08:38.004 --> 08:39.938
Okay.

08:43.743 --> 08:45.544
You're okay to stay today?

08:45.578 --> 08:46.878
Hi, sweet girl.

08:46.913 --> 08:49.414
Sure you don't want to go
see that boyfriend of yours?

08:49.449 --> 08:50.615
Didn't you say he was leaving soon?

08:50.650 --> 08:52.384
Oh, yeah.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.152
He's going on tour with his band.

08:54.187 --> 08:55.387
But it's fine.

08:55.421 --> 08:57.255
And your moms... they're okay with this,

08:57.290 --> 08:59.024
with you spending all your time here?

08:59.058 --> 09:00.759
Oh, yeah. They're totally fine.

09:00.793 --> 09:03.862
- And they're not mad?
- About what?

09:03.896 --> 09:06.598
That I kept Isabella.

09:09.569 --> 09:11.403
No.

09:11.437 --> 09:14.005
Not at all.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.941
They're happy for you, I promise.

09:20.113 --> 09:22.013
There you go, beautiful.

09:29.789 --> 09:31.556
Good morning.

09:31.591 --> 09:35.327
Hey, so I've got a few projects
I could use your help with.

09:35.361 --> 09:37.262
We need to repaint the chairs from outside,

09:37.296 --> 09:38.997
the metal ones. Would you mind?

09:39.031 --> 09:40.065
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

09:40.099 --> 09:42.100
I picked up some spray paint on my way in.

09:43.903 --> 09:45.170
Win the storage cabinet before we go home.

09:45.204 --> 09:46.738
Lock it up? Why?

09:46.773 --> 09:48.607
Kids steal it. They huff with it,

09:48.641 --> 09:49.908
or sell it to gangs.

09:49.942 --> 09:52.677
Looks like I left it in
my car. I'll be right back.

10:08.694 --> 10:10.796
Y'all got computers in here?

10:12.532 --> 10:13.765
The center is for foster kids.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.667
I am a foster kid.

10:15.701 --> 10:17.502
Oh.

10:17.537 --> 10:19.137
Okay.

10:19.172 --> 10:21.439
Well, what's your name?

10:22.408 --> 10:24.142
A.J.

10:24.177 --> 10:25.977
Okay, A.J.,

10:26.012 --> 10:28.713
well, the computers are over here.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.948
Is this the registration line?

10:53.982 --> 10:56.417
Yeah.

10:56.451 --> 10:57.618
I'm Brandon.

10:57.653 --> 10:59.453
Ekaterina.

10:59.488 --> 11:01.489
- Ekater...
- Just call me Kat.

11:01.523 --> 11:03.424
Okay.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.193
So what are you st... ?

11:05.227 --> 11:06.961
- Piano performance.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

11:09.832 --> 11:12.033
- Name and discipline?
- Brandon Foster, piano.

11:13.702 --> 11:15.536
Sorry.

11:15.571 --> 11:16.838
You said Brandon Foster?

11:16.872 --> 11:17.839
Yes.

11:17.873 --> 11:19.707
Oh, wait. Here you are.

11:19.741 --> 11:22.577
But you're not a pianist.
You're here as a composer.

11:22.611 --> 11:25.012
Oh, you're a composer too, huh?

11:25.047 --> 11:26.247
I'm Tony.

11:26.281 --> 11:29.016
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.

11:29.051 --> 11:30.785
I'm definitely, like, a pianist.

11:30.819 --> 11:32.153
Maybe there's someone I could...

11:32.187 --> 11:34.789
Miss Sanderson, hi. Miss Sanderson.

11:34.823 --> 11:36.891
Oh, Teri, please. Hi, Brandon.

11:36.925 --> 11:39.694
Excuse me, I think there's been a mix-up.

11:39.728 --> 11:42.630
They've got me listed as a
composor and I'm a pianist.

11:42.664 --> 11:44.532
Oh, did you not read
your acceptance letter?

11:44.566 --> 11:46.267
I'm pretty sure it was clear.

11:46.301 --> 11:48.369
I may have seen the word "congratulations"

11:48.403 --> 11:50.071
and started running around the house.

11:50.105 --> 11:52.273
To be honest, I didn't
think your technique was

11:52.307 --> 11:55.009
where it needed to be
for the performance track.

11:55.043 --> 11:57.912
But I did hear something
in that piece you wrote,

11:57.946 --> 12:00.615
something really special.

12:00.649 --> 12:03.284
This is a wonderful program.

12:03.318 --> 12:05.286
I hope you'll give it a chance.

12:07.590 --> 12:10.224
I couldn't help but notice
that you didn't mention

12:10.259 --> 12:12.860
that the truck had been stolen
till the day after the accident.

12:12.895 --> 12:14.095
Why was that exactly?

12:14.129 --> 12:15.997
I already told the cops all this.

12:16.031 --> 12:17.765
Well, you didn't tell these cops.

12:17.799 --> 12:19.667
I used to park it behind the garage

12:19.701 --> 12:21.535
'cause it didn't have the tags

12:21.570 --> 12:23.337
- or the registration or...
- Right.

12:23.372 --> 12:25.273
Yeah, but the key was in
the vehicle when it crashed.

12:25.307 --> 12:27.275
I used to leave the
keys up behind the visor.

12:27.342 --> 12:29.977
I never expected anybody to
steal a piece of junk like that.

12:30.012 --> 12:32.113
I didn't even know it was gone
till my son said something.

12:32.147 --> 12:34.015
Oh, you have a son?

12:34.049 --> 12:36.083
Oh, I don't recall seeing that

12:36.118 --> 12:37.852
mentioned in the reports.
Does he live here?

12:37.886 --> 12:39.820
Oh, no.

12:39.855 --> 12:42.356
He stays with some buddies over on Cliff.

12:42.391 --> 12:44.659
That's why I didn't say anything about him.

12:44.693 --> 12:47.094
Well, if you could give us
any kind of contact information

12:47.129 --> 12:48.996
you have for him, we'd
really appreciate it.

12:49.031 --> 12:50.264
What's his name?

12:53.168 --> 12:55.136
Thought you might be hungry.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.038
Thank you.

13:02.411 --> 13:03.678
So you work here?

13:03.712 --> 13:05.646
Yeah, just part of my privileged life,

13:05.681 --> 13:09.116
along with seven foster
homes and juvie, you know.

13:09.151 --> 13:11.052
I'm sorry.

13:11.086 --> 13:12.153
What's that?

13:13.121 --> 13:15.723
Oh, it's stupid.

13:15.757 --> 13:17.692
I don't think it is. I like it.

13:17.726 --> 13:18.993
Let me see.

13:19.027 --> 13:20.962
Who is that?

13:20.996 --> 13:24.598
It's... it's dumb.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.467
It's this guy that me
and my brother made up

13:26.501 --> 13:29.203
when we got put into the system
and sent to different homes.

13:29.237 --> 13:33.040
He was like our own
private superhero, you know?

13:33.075 --> 13:36.911
Yeah, me and my brother could
have used someone like that.

13:38.146 --> 13:40.047
We'd...

13:40.082 --> 13:43.684
we'd put the symbol in the
windows of our bedrooms,

13:43.719 --> 13:45.753
and that meant we were supposed
to meet at Belmont Park.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.388
Like the Bat signal?

13:47.422 --> 13:48.689
Yeah.

13:48.724 --> 13:50.624
Yeah.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.128
Where is your brother now?

13:57.899 --> 14:00.801
Okay, well, if you need
anything, just let me know.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.809
What?

14:08.844 --> 14:10.745
You're so good at that, Callie.

14:10.779 --> 14:14.482
You're so good with the
kids who come in here,

14:14.516 --> 14:17.385
getting them to open
up. It's pretty amazing.

14:17.419 --> 14:19.120
Now I really hope

14:19.154 --> 14:21.188
that when this independent
study of yours is over,

14:21.223 --> 14:23.991
that you'll keep working here.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.893
You've got a real gift.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.047
Who is that?

14:46.081 --> 14:48.783
Uh, it's me actually.

14:48.817 --> 14:50.551
I wrote it for my audition.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.486
Oh, really?

14:52.521 --> 14:54.388
It's lovely.

14:54.423 --> 14:55.689
You think so?

14:55.724 --> 14:59.093
'Cause I, you know... I... I thought
I was coming here as a pianist

14:59.127 --> 15:01.228
and they put me in the composing track.

15:01.263 --> 15:04.131
So I don't know what I want to do now.

15:04.166 --> 15:06.767
Really?

15:06.802 --> 15:09.570
That's not a demotion, you know.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.573
Composers are the real
rock stars around here.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.442
I mean, think about it.

15:14.476 --> 15:16.343
Nobody remembers the guy who played Mozart

15:16.378 --> 15:18.379
in front of the king,

15:18.413 --> 15:20.381
but everybody knows Mozart.

15:29.524 --> 15:30.858
So the stage will be set up here,

15:30.892 --> 15:33.527
the refreshments here, where
we can keep a good eye on them.

15:33.562 --> 15:36.464
And over here will be the sort of
hangout area. Does that sound good?

15:36.498 --> 15:38.499
Perfect. Great work.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.201
And day one of summer school?

15:40.235 --> 15:42.236
Off without a hitch, as far as I can tell.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.238
It's great that we were able
to hire those extra teachers.

15:44.272 --> 15:46.040
Thank you, Kilfer grant.

15:46.074 --> 15:47.842
Speaking of the Kilfer grant,

15:47.876 --> 15:50.644
one of the benefits that
comes with it is a trip for two

15:50.679 --> 15:52.546
to D.C. for their national conference.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.748
And it's coming up,
like, early July, I think.

15:54.783 --> 15:57.284
I hear it's incredible. The most amazing

15:57.319 --> 15:59.320
progressive thinkers in
the business are all there.

15:59.354 --> 16:01.055
So can you come?

16:02.124 --> 16:03.324
Um...

16:04.826 --> 16:06.060
Okay.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.536
When are things gonna stop
being weird between us?

16:15.570 --> 16:20.407
I don't even know what
that little kiss was about.

16:20.442 --> 16:23.210
I'm straight.

16:23.245 --> 16:25.846
I was married.

16:25.881 --> 16:28.549
It was nothing. Right?

16:30.485 --> 16:33.320
Yes, absolutely.

16:33.355 --> 16:35.389
Okay, good.

16:35.423 --> 16:37.424
So can we just go back to how things were?

16:37.459 --> 16:38.526
Yes.

16:38.593 --> 16:40.294
And you'll think about the trip?

16:40.328 --> 16:42.229
I'm telling you, we'll have a great time.

16:42.264 --> 16:43.864
I promise.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.800
Man: So, as you know,

16:46.835 --> 16:49.637
composers are paired with a
musician for their magnum opus...

16:49.671 --> 16:52.473
the piece that you'll be working
on together all summer long.

16:52.507 --> 16:54.375
The big news is, this year,

16:54.409 --> 16:56.544
the piece deemed best by the faculty

16:56.578 --> 16:59.480
will be performed with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic

16:59.514 --> 17:01.348
at Disney Hall.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.184
Oh my god, I hope I get Kat.

17:03.218 --> 17:05.019
She's, hands down, the best one here.

17:05.053 --> 17:06.887
Teacher: Okay, so here we go.

17:06.922 --> 17:09.890
Mischa, you're working with Andre.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.858
Tony, you'll be with Jin.

17:11.893 --> 17:13.560
And, Brandon, you'll be working with...

17:13.595 --> 17:15.695
Wait, no. Yes.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.565
Right, you'll be working with Kat.

17:17.598 --> 17:19.465
- Yes, Kat.
- I'm sorry,

17:19.501 --> 17:21.468
I'm one of the most
accomplished musicians here.

17:21.502 --> 17:24.070
There's no way you're pairing
me with him. He's brand new.

17:24.105 --> 17:26.807
I'm s... I... I thought

17:26.840 --> 17:28.776
you liked my piece. You said it was lovely.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.811
Yeah, I was being nice. Sure, it's lovely,

17:30.845 --> 17:33.714
for a six-year-old.
You're not ready for this.

17:33.748 --> 17:37.284
I've been coming to this camp every
summer for the last five years.

17:37.319 --> 17:39.386
And I'm certainly not gonna lose
my chance of playing Disney Hall

17:39.421 --> 17:41.222
because I got partnered with some amateur.

17:41.256 --> 17:43.958
Brandon, please forgive Kat. She's
very passionate about her work.

17:43.992 --> 17:46.860
And I'm sorry, Kat, but these
partnerships aren't up for discussion.

17:46.895 --> 17:48.195
I, for one, am very excited

17:48.230 --> 17:50.564
about what you and Brandon
come up with together.

17:50.599 --> 17:51.966
- But...
- End of conversation.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.768
Kieran, you'll be working with Reese.

17:54.803 --> 17:56.670
Christian and Kay, and Timothy...

17:59.708 --> 18:01.894
Okay, so your dad's coming
to pick you up, right?

18:02.028 --> 18:04.162
Do you want me to wait?

18:04.197 --> 18:06.064
No, I'm good.

18:06.099 --> 18:08.133
Okay, I'll call you.

18:10.970 --> 18:13.538
Hey, what are you guys... ?

18:13.573 --> 18:16.575
Daria signed us up to decorate
for the party tomorrow.

18:16.609 --> 18:19.544
Can you just tell me one thing?

18:19.579 --> 18:22.280
Why? Why would you break up with me?

18:22.315 --> 18:24.149
I don't get it.

18:25.918 --> 18:28.920
You know what? Just forget it, okay?

18:30.123 --> 18:31.957
Why don't you just tell her?

18:31.991 --> 18:33.058
Tell her what?

18:33.092 --> 18:35.961
That you're into Jude.
It's completely obvious.

18:35.995 --> 18:38.730
I... I just...

18:39.832 --> 18:41.600
I can't.

Is that a baby book?

19:03.716 --> 19:06.551
Is there something you want to tell me?

19:06.586 --> 19:09.221
No, it's for Isabella.

19:09.255 --> 19:11.156
Figured.

19:11.190 --> 19:14.359
I mean, it would be kind of
hard for you to be, you know...

19:14.393 --> 19:17.028
because we haven't, you know...

19:22.068 --> 19:24.603
So are you avoiding me?

19:24.637 --> 19:26.872
I mean, is that why you're spending
all your time with the baby?

19:26.906 --> 19:29.474
No.

19:29.509 --> 19:30.642
Not really.

19:30.676 --> 19:33.345
I mean, I have to do something
all summer too, right?

19:33.379 --> 19:36.047
And you're gonna be gone. And
Ana really needs the help, so...

19:36.082 --> 19:39.050
And that's why I've barely seen
you at all in the last week?

19:44.924 --> 19:47.392
You're coming to the party
tomorrow at school, right?

19:47.426 --> 19:49.528
Yeah, if I can.

19:49.562 --> 19:52.264
Mariana, it's the start of the tour.

19:52.298 --> 19:55.133
Look, I'll be there as soon as Elena
gets home from the bakery, okay?

19:56.335 --> 19:57.802
Okay.

I have no idea.

20:14.086 --> 20:16.888
Don't forget I'm only here till noon today.

20:16.923 --> 20:18.990
Oh, yeah. That's right. Why is that again?

20:19.025 --> 20:21.927
Well, I decided that I'm doing

20:21.961 --> 20:23.828
everything in my power this summer

20:23.863 --> 20:25.830
to act like a normal teenager, so I'm going

20:25.865 --> 20:28.700
to the stupid Anchor Beach
end-of-the-year party thing.

20:28.734 --> 20:30.635
Oh, yeah? Where are they having it?

20:30.670 --> 20:32.804
On the beach, like, right
in front of the school.

20:32.838 --> 20:34.539
Wow, nice.

20:34.574 --> 20:36.441
We never had any parties
like that where I went.

20:36.475 --> 20:38.210
They were like, "school's
over. Get out of here."

20:38.244 --> 20:41.012
Yeah, I know. I still can't
believe I go to school...

20:45.051 --> 20:46.851
Callie, everything okay?

20:46.886 --> 20:48.787
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.461
Hey. Hey, A.J., wait up.

20:56.495 --> 20:58.463
Look, you can't sleep in there, okay?

20:58.497 --> 21:00.398
But if you ran away from your foster home,

21:00.433 --> 21:02.634
or if you need anything,
I can help you, okay?

21:02.668 --> 21:05.036
I won't get you in trouble, I promise.

21:10.076 --> 21:12.944
Hey, sorry I'm so late. The bus never came.

21:12.979 --> 21:15.647
I ended up having to steal Jude's bike.

21:15.681 --> 21:18.483
Elena, you can get going! I'm here!

21:18.517 --> 21:20.685
She left already.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.354
Wow.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.490
I went to the doctor yesterday

21:25.524 --> 21:27.325
and he told me I could take off my brace.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.227
Said I need to take it easy,

21:29.262 --> 21:31.129
but I can start doing normal things again,

21:31.163 --> 21:33.131
for a few hours.

21:33.165 --> 21:35.100
Well, do you need me to take her?

21:35.134 --> 21:36.968
She probably needs to be changed.

21:37.003 --> 21:38.803
Nope, just changed her.

21:41.807 --> 21:44.676
Well, you should probably
lift her head a little bit.

21:44.710 --> 21:47.345
Her neck is...

21:47.380 --> 21:50.081
Do you need any help?

21:52.151 --> 21:54.019
Okay, well,

21:54.053 --> 21:57.022
be careful. I don't want
you to hurt yourself.

21:57.056 --> 21:58.523
You know what? I'm fine.

21:58.558 --> 22:00.859
I've got this. Thank you.

22:02.628 --> 22:04.262
Sorry.

22:04.297 --> 22:06.564
Listen, I really appreciate
you coming all this time,

22:06.599 --> 22:09.401
but I think I need to spend

22:09.435 --> 22:11.336
some time alone with Bella, okay?

22:15.041 --> 22:16.908
Okay.

22:18.678 --> 22:20.812
Don't you have a school party today?

22:20.846 --> 22:22.647
Go.

22:22.682 --> 22:24.616
You know, go see that
boyfriend before he leaves.

22:24.650 --> 22:26.584
Give him a reason to miss you.

22:29.491 --> 22:31.291
It's my dad's truck, okay?

22:31.293 --> 22:33.193
I don't know what you
think I got to do with it.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.262
Why would I steal it? I got my own car.

22:35.297 --> 22:36.964
And a suspended driver's license.

22:36.998 --> 22:39.199
Maybe you just didn't feel like
driving your own car that day.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.869
Look, what do you want me to
say? I didn't take the truck.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.070
I haven't driven that thing

22:43.104 --> 22:45.039
in, I don't know, a few years.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.840
Okay.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.543
You don't mind hanging
out for a few minutes?

22:49.578 --> 22:50.711
Thank you.

22:55.136 --> 22:56.971
You see that cut above his eye?

22:57.005 --> 22:59.206
Looks to be about three weeks
old to me, and totally consistent

22:59.241 --> 23:01.742
with someone who might have hit
their head on a steering wheel.

23:01.776 --> 23:03.010
- I checked his prints.
- And?

23:03.044 --> 23:04.945
They don't match the ones
on the steering wheel.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.614
You're kidding.

23:06.648 --> 23:08.816
There's no way it could be him.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.687
- Okay.
- Also they're sending the cars to the junkyard,

23:13.722 --> 23:16.557
so if you need anything out of the
Volvo, this is your last chance.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.350
I quit my coding class

23:43.385 --> 23:45.286
and I gave up my whole
summer for her and the baby,

23:45.320 --> 23:47.154
and now it's like she
doesn't even want me around.

23:47.188 --> 23:49.356
I'd be willing to bet
that's not entirely true.

23:49.391 --> 23:51.926
Well, you would lose that bet.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.894
And stupid mat is leaving.

23:53.929 --> 23:56.864
Probably gonna forget all about me
and hook up with all those groupies.

23:56.898 --> 24:00.668
You think someone's
little sister has groupies?

24:00.702 --> 24:02.636
He is not gonna forget about you.

24:02.671 --> 24:04.672
Well, I'm gonna make sure of that.

24:04.706 --> 24:07.374
I'm gonna have sex with him.

24:07.409 --> 24:10.544
Wait, you're gonna lose your virginity?

24:10.579 --> 24:13.147
Are you sure you're ready for that?

24:34.569 --> 24:37.605

25:00.795 --> 25:02.630

25:02.664 --> 25:05.566
Wait, Brandon, sorry. I'll be right back.

25:09.404 --> 25:11.305
Sorry I crashed your party.

25:11.339 --> 25:13.374
How did you even know I was here?

25:13.408 --> 25:15.309
You and that guy were
talking about it this morning.

25:15.343 --> 25:17.745
- I didn't know where else to go, so...
- What happened?

25:17.779 --> 25:19.813
I was looking for a place
to sleep tonight, you know,

25:19.848 --> 25:21.915
someplace safe, and a
couple guys jumped me.

25:21.950 --> 25:23.584
You...

25:25.487 --> 25:27.354
you said you could help me.

25:27.389 --> 25:28.656
Yeah. Yes, I will.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.524
But I can't really do that

25:30.558 --> 25:32.493
unless I know exactly what's going on.

25:35.363 --> 25:38.198
I ran away from my foster family.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.868
They was pretty cool
and all, but I ran away

25:40.902 --> 25:42.803
'cause I was supposed to
meet up with my brother.

25:42.837 --> 25:45.639
He aged out a couple of years
ago, so he's been on his own.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.708
But we were supposed to
take off and get out of town.

25:47.742 --> 25:49.643
We had this whole plan, but
when I was supposed to meet him,

25:49.678 --> 25:51.478
he never showed up.

25:51.513 --> 25:54.314
Okay, what if we called
your foster parents?

25:54.349 --> 25:56.250
They always told me, "you run one time...

25:56.284 --> 25:58.152
that's it. We're done."

25:58.186 --> 26:00.087
Okay, so if you can't go back,

26:00.121 --> 26:02.956
we can get you emergency placement.

26:02.991 --> 26:04.992
But where are you gonna sleep tonight?

26:10.632 --> 26:11.732
You got it?

26:11.867 --> 26:13.200
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay.

26:18.136 --> 26:21.193
Okay, wait, wait, wait, so
you two are gay for each other?

26:23.074 --> 26:25.909
Yeah. So what? You got
something to say about it?

26:25.943 --> 26:28.011
No, man. It's all good.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.980
- I just heard and I thought...
- You thought what?

26:30.014 --> 26:32.048
- Nothing, man. It's cool.
- Then get out of my face.

26:32.083 --> 26:35.719
- I knew it wasn't me.
- Shut up, Daria.

26:35.753 --> 26:38.621
- I thought we weren't gonna say anything.
- Don't be mad at Connor.

26:38.656 --> 26:41.624
It wasn't him. It was me.

26:41.659 --> 26:43.593
- Connor: What?
- Well, I thought I was helping.

26:43.627 --> 26:45.595
I thought you were the one
who didn't want to come out,

26:45.629 --> 26:48.465
so I figured nobody was gonna care.

26:48.499 --> 26:50.867
I'm sorry.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.103
It's not like anyone cares if you're gay.

26:53.137 --> 26:56.806
I'm not gay, okay?

26:56.841 --> 26:59.676
Wait, Jude. Jude.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.255
Do you like the new stuff?

27:02.856 --> 27:04.569
The new songs, I mean?

27:05.249 --> 27:07.817
I do like the new stuff.

27:07.851 --> 27:10.787
But I like other stuff too.

27:11.755 --> 27:12.955
Oh, yeah?

27:12.990 --> 27:14.791
Mm-hmm.

27:14.825 --> 27:16.626
And I was thinking

27:16.660 --> 27:18.561
maybe we could do some other stuff tonight.

27:22.499 --> 27:26.002
I mean, you're leaving soon and...

27:30.908 --> 27:32.975
On the beach?

27:33.010 --> 27:35.611
Why not? It's romantic.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.714
It's kind of public.

27:38.749 --> 27:40.383
Not up here.

27:40.417 --> 27:42.585
- It's your last night.
- Yeah, I know,

27:42.619 --> 27:45.454
but, Mariana, I don't want to do it.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.356
I mean, I want to do it,

27:47.391 --> 27:50.126
but not like this.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.628
It's our first time, and...

27:53.730 --> 27:56.465
we gotta get on the road.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.367
We've got a midnight show in L.A.

27:58.402 --> 27:59.769
I'm sorry.

28:02.439 --> 28:05.408
I should probably get
back, help load up the van.

28:05.442 --> 28:07.043
Okay.

28:07.077 --> 28:08.978
I think I'm just gonna...

28:13.684 --> 28:15.785
Okay,

28:15.819 --> 28:17.687
well,

28:17.721 --> 28:19.655
I'll see you in a few weeks.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.528
I'll miss you.

28:25.562 --> 28:27.463
I'll miss you too.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.037
Okay.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.083
Nice set.

28:47.317 --> 28:49.518
I mean, the new guy you got

28:49.553 --> 28:51.420
could use a little finesse.

28:51.455 --> 28:53.356
It's kind of like watching a bear

28:53.390 --> 28:56.025
play keyboard, but...

28:56.059 --> 28:58.261
We can't all be classical
pianists, you know.

28:58.295 --> 29:00.796
Right. No kidding.

29:00.831 --> 29:03.699
Turns out, I'm not one either.

29:03.734 --> 29:06.736
They made me a composer at Idyllwild.

29:06.770 --> 29:10.640
I'm not even there to play.

29:12.142 --> 29:15.378
Is that... is that a bad thing?

29:15.412 --> 29:17.313
I mean, it's not what I wanted.

29:17.347 --> 29:18.347
Okay, sure,

29:18.382 --> 29:20.349
but you're a great composer, Brandon.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.952
You love writing songs.

29:22.986 --> 29:24.820
Why are you acting like this is

29:24.855 --> 29:26.889
some kind of epic fail or something?

29:26.924 --> 29:30.760
'Cause the kids there are
totally out of my league.

29:30.794 --> 29:32.695
Is this what happens

29:32.729 --> 29:34.730
when everything just
comes naturally to you...

29:34.765 --> 29:37.533
you just give up the
minute something gets hard?

29:39.469 --> 29:42.004
Besides, I'm sure you're
better than you think.

29:42.039 --> 29:44.040
You guys aren't even playing my songs.

29:44.074 --> 29:47.109
Out of respect, Brandon.
They aren't ours to play.

29:54.518 --> 29:57.386
Well, I think you should...

29:57.421 --> 29:58.654
play them, I mean.

29:58.689 --> 30:00.456
If I'm gonna be a composer,

30:00.490 --> 30:02.491
I'd better get used to other
people playing my songs,

30:02.526 --> 30:05.094
even bear paws over there.

30:12.903 --> 30:15.104
(Laughs) What are you doing here?

30:15.138 --> 30:18.808
Well, you know how to throw a party, huh?

30:18.842 --> 30:20.743
(Chuckles)

30:20.777 --> 30:22.745
Well, I was lonely.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.880
Stefanie Marie Adams Foster,

30:24.915 --> 30:26.816
you haven't had a night alone in that house

30:26.850 --> 30:28.517
for the last 10 years.

30:28.552 --> 30:31.253
I don't for one second
buy that you got lonely.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.222
What is it?

30:35.058 --> 30:37.259
I'm a mess.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.195
I'm trying to hold it together.

30:39.229 --> 30:41.764
I'm trying to... I'm trying to find out

30:41.798 --> 30:44.000
who the hell did this and...

30:44.034 --> 30:46.502
they told... they said someone was dead.

30:46.536 --> 30:48.404
They said there were reported fatalities.

30:48.438 --> 30:49.739
And when I walked up and I saw the Volvo,

30:49.773 --> 30:52.241
it was crushed like a beer can.

30:52.275 --> 30:54.443
I thought...

30:54.478 --> 30:56.345
I thought we lost them.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.280
I thought my babies were gone.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.950
And I thought I'd never
be okay, ever again.

31:04.988 --> 31:08.624
I just wanted to see you.
I just wanted to see you.

31:09.626 --> 31:11.594
Oh.

31:11.628 --> 31:13.562
My love.

31:13.597 --> 31:16.165
My sweet, sweet love.

31:18.235 --> 31:21.037
It's all gonna be okay.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.044
Hey, what are you doing here?

31:28.078 --> 31:30.012
I go to school here, remember?

31:31.748 --> 31:33.716
Why aren't you back at the... ?

31:33.750 --> 31:36.252
Not really in the mood.

31:36.286 --> 31:39.422
Yeah, me neither. Do you want a beer?

31:46.129 --> 31:48.130
Oops, I'm sorry.

31:48.165 --> 31:50.199
Why are you apologizing?

31:50.233 --> 31:52.868
It's good for the kids to
see that you're a human being.

31:52.903 --> 31:55.071
Not some education reform monster?

31:55.105 --> 31:57.706
Yes, exactly.

31:57.741 --> 32:02.411
Speaking of education reform,

32:02.446 --> 32:04.547
I...

32:04.581 --> 32:06.482
I can't go to the conference.

32:06.516 --> 32:08.384
Really? Oh, no.

32:08.418 --> 32:10.286
- Are you sure?
- I am.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.288
I... I have just

32:12.322 --> 32:14.090
too much going on at home right now

32:14.124 --> 32:17.026
for me to even consider
planning a trip away.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.861
So...

32:18.895 --> 32:20.129
I hope you understand.

32:20.163 --> 32:22.665
Of course.

32:22.699 --> 32:24.700
Of course I do.

32:32.843 --> 32:35.177
You'd better leave the lights off.

32:35.212 --> 32:38.114
Right. Smart.

32:38.148 --> 32:42.084
Please don't, like, mess with anything.

32:42.119 --> 32:44.920
I won't, I promise.

32:44.955 --> 32:46.122
Thank you.

32:46.156 --> 32:48.924
I should... I should thank you.

32:48.959 --> 32:51.994
It probably sounds dumb,

32:52.028 --> 32:55.764
but I have to write

32:55.799 --> 32:58.367
this paper for my independent study

32:58.401 --> 33:01.237
and I had no idea what to do.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.405
But now I think I'm gonna do it

33:03.440 --> 33:07.042
on what happens to kids when
they're separated in the system,

33:07.077 --> 33:09.378
- like you and your brother.
- Glad I could help.

33:09.412 --> 33:12.214
Okay, well, I'll be back
first thing in the morning

33:12.249 --> 33:14.183
to open up, so...

33:14.217 --> 33:16.018
'Night.

33:16.052 --> 33:17.753

33:30.567 --> 33:34.603
I do sometimes, but...

33:34.638 --> 33:38.107
Out of sight, out of mind, you know?

33:40.210 --> 33:43.245
Okay, how do you do that?

33:43.280 --> 33:46.148
How do you get your hair to fall like that?

33:46.183 --> 33:49.752
It's softer than mine.

33:49.786 --> 33:50.953
What do you do?

33:50.987 --> 33:53.656
Do you use some special
conditioner or something?

33:53.690 --> 33:56.725
No, it just comes out of my head like this.

33:57.761 --> 34:01.330
It's just so pretty.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.167

You know, you could have made it

34:35.596 --> 34:39.364
a little easier on me, all right?

34:39.400 --> 34:41.400
I am on crutches.

34:45.505 --> 34:47.440
So I don't...

34:47.474 --> 34:49.475
I don't get it.

34:51.411 --> 34:53.880
What do you mean, you're not gay?

34:57.785 --> 34:59.819
Do you not like me?

34:59.853 --> 35:01.788
No, of course I like you.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.725
Do you not like me like that?

35:05.759 --> 35:08.394
No, I do. I just...

35:10.497 --> 35:14.300
my whole life I've always
been labeled as something...

35:14.335 --> 35:16.369
"the new kid," or "the foster kid,"

35:16.403 --> 35:19.072
or "the kid with the dead
mom." And I'm sick of it.

35:19.106 --> 35:22.241
I mean, why can't I just be Jude?

35:22.276 --> 35:25.111
I just want to be Jude for a while.

35:28.882 --> 35:31.684
Does that mean you don't
want to be my boyfriend?

35:31.719 --> 35:32.785
No.

35:32.820 --> 35:35.622
Okay.

35:35.656 --> 35:37.690
Okay, good. 'Cause I thought...

35:37.725 --> 35:40.593
No, I promise.

36:48.962 --> 36:50.863
Another bad dream?

36:50.898 --> 36:52.899
No, just thinking.

36:52.933 --> 36:54.867
Everything okay?

36:56.837 --> 36:58.838
Absolutely.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.577
You know, I was doing a
little thinking myself.

37:04.611 --> 37:06.746
Uh-oh.

37:06.780 --> 37:10.483
I know you're gonna say no,

37:10.517 --> 37:13.319
but I think that we should

37:13.353 --> 37:17.056
plan a little trip, just you and me.

37:17.091 --> 37:19.425
We could really use a getaway.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.161
I think it's a terrific idea.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.764
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

37:26.133 --> 37:29.001
Well, wherever shall we go?

37:29.036 --> 37:31.501
- The Greek Isles?
- Oh.

37:31.505 --> 37:33.673
Capri?

37:33.707 --> 37:37.343
I think Catalina is a
little more our budget.

37:39.646 --> 37:41.414
I like Catalina.

37:41.448 --> 37:44.317
I do too, as long as you're there.

37:44.351 --> 37:47.220
Are you sure we can afford it?

37:47.254 --> 37:50.089
We'll make sure it's a priority.

37:50.124 --> 37:52.225
Deal?

37:52.259 --> 37:53.993
Yeah.

38:11.378 --> 38:13.312
What? What are you looking at?

38:13.347 --> 38:15.581
Oh, I think our bathroom is leaking again.

38:15.616 --> 38:19.352
I thought the plumber took care of that.

38:19.386 --> 38:20.553
He did.

38:22.156 --> 38:24.056
Be careful.

38:24.091 --> 38:26.058
Just hold on.

38:27.327 --> 38:28.928
What... ?

38:30.330 --> 38:32.865
- Oh my god!
- Oh!

38:36.203 --> 38:38.938
So much for getting away.

38:40.774 --> 38:42.708
It is kind of shaped like Catalina.

38:49.850 --> 38:51.784
So?

38:51.819 --> 38:53.386
Hmm?

38:53.420 --> 38:55.521
Did you, you know... ?

38:57.457 --> 38:59.592
Mariana, come on, I have
to go. Can you just tell me?

38:59.626 --> 39:02.261
Did you have sex last night or not?

39:04.298 --> 39:05.298
Yeah.

39:05.332 --> 39:07.200
Oh my god.

39:07.234 --> 39:10.069
Okay, I want to hear all about it,
but I have to get to the center.

39:10.103 --> 39:12.839
But I will talk to you tonight, okay?

39:12.873 --> 39:14.907
(Giggles)

39:24.785 --> 39:26.853
What are you doing
here? I thought you quit.

39:26.887 --> 39:29.956
I'm not going anywhere,
except for Disney Hall.

39:29.990 --> 39:33.459
Oh, and you might want to start
working on your quadruple trills.

39:33.493 --> 39:35.795
The new piece I'm working
on has got a bunch of 'em.

39:35.829 --> 39:38.431
See you in class.

39:38.465 --> 39:40.700
Oh, and for the record,

39:40.734 --> 39:42.635
I'm sure you're used to pitching your fits

39:42.669 --> 39:44.403
and getting what you want.

39:44.438 --> 39:46.339
But I'm the oldest of five kids.

39:46.373 --> 39:49.041
I've seen every kind
of tantrum ever thrown.

39:49.076 --> 39:51.077
I don't scare easy.

40:01.154 --> 40:03.122
A.J.

40:06.026 --> 40:07.960
A.J.

40:14.735 --> 40:16.903
Hey, what are you doing here so early?

40:20.641 --> 40:22.608
What happened to the spray paint?

40:22.643 --> 40:24.777
Callie, what's wrong?

40:26.647 --> 40:28.614
Uh,

40:28.649 --> 40:30.616
I did something really dumb.

40:32.419 --> 40:37.690
I... I let someone sleep here last night.

40:37.724 --> 40:40.393
Damn it, Callie.

40:40.427 --> 40:41.761
Why?

40:41.795 --> 40:43.596
Why would you do that?

40:43.630 --> 40:47.600
It's such a bad judgment call.

40:47.634 --> 40:50.803
You know, I don't even know what to say.

40:50.837 --> 40:53.606
I'm so sorry.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.541
Yeah,

40:55.575 --> 40:57.510
I'm sure you are.

40:58.578 --> 41:02.515
I need this, Rafael, to graduate.

41:03.784 --> 41:06.519
You should have thought
of that before you did it.

41:09.890 --> 41:12.391
You're fired, Callie.

41:13.493 --> 41:15.461
Go home.
