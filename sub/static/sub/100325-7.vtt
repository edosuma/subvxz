But it doesn’t really matter,

07:49.627 --> 07:51.396
because they kind of hate me
right now.

07:51.396 --> 07:53.759
So who cares how far away
they are?

07:53.759 --> 07:55.561
It kind of sounds like
\h\hyou’re missing them.

07:55.561 --> 07:57.594
No, no, absolutely not.

07:57.594 --> 08:00.561
But, you know,
if you are lonely this holiday,

08:00.561 --> 08:05.429
and I know that Julia would
love to have you at our place.

08:05.429 --> 08:07.759
Are you inviting me
\h\h\hto Thanksgiving?

08:07.759 --> 08:09.759
Are you accepting?

08:09.759 --> 08:13.198
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYeah.
Yeah, I think I can stop by.

08:13.198 --> 08:16.429
(chuckles)
Okay, cool.

08:16.429 --> 08:20.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd so the student said,
who’s 14 years old, by the way,

08:20.264 --> 08:22.495
uh, "What makes you think
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI’m high?"

08:22.495 --> 08:24.594
\h\h\h\h\hAnd I was like, you know,
"I don’t know. It’s a toss-up.

08:24.594 --> 08:26.924
"It’s either the bright red
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hcolor of your eyes

08:26.924 --> 08:29.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hor the marijuana leaf
emblazoned on your T-shirt."

08:29.759 --> 08:31.363
I love hearing
about your students.

08:31.363 --> 08:33.132
It’s so interesting. It’s--
Of course he was high. Eh.

08:33.132 --> 08:34.957
Um, but I have to get this
over with.

08:34.957 --> 08:39.495
Why did you send me this emoji
of doom?

08:39.495 --> 08:41.957
Oh, no, he does not look happy,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hdoes he?

08:41.957 --> 08:43.462
Or she.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.561
Do emojis have preferred
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hpronouns?

08:45.561 --> 08:47.561
Because I’m really not good
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwith them,

08:47.561 --> 08:50.231
and I really wasn’t sure
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwhat to say.

08:50.231 --> 08:53.231
Of course you weren’t.
I-I was moving way too fast.

08:53.231 --> 08:55.561
I was talking about the future
and having kids,

08:55.561 --> 08:57.396
and we only just
first started dating.

08:57.396 --> 08:59.792
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIt’s all right.
You can ask about that stuff.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.165
I just wasn’t sure what to say
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hin a text message.

09:02.165 --> 09:04.330
So I-I guess I sent
\h\h\h\h\hwhat I thought

09:04.330 --> 09:05.330
was a neutral response.

09:05.330 --> 09:07.231
So you’re neutral?

09:07.231 --> 09:08.429
Not about you.

09:08.429 --> 09:10.594
No, about you, I’m like...

09:10.594 --> 09:12.099
(laughs)

09:12.099 --> 09:14.033
But as far as having
more kids someday...

09:14.033 --> 09:17.594
No, I-I--it’s a lot.
I get that.

09:17.594 --> 09:20.825
I like you, and I want to
spend more time with you,

09:20.825 --> 09:23.594
\hand I don’t want to
make things awkward.

09:23.594 --> 09:25.561
\hI feel like maybe
I made it awkward.

09:26.825 --> 09:28.000
A little.
(laughs)

09:28.000 --> 09:30.495
But, um, we’ll get through it.

09:30.495 --> 09:31.792
Right?

09:36.198 --> 09:38.231
Any Thanksgiving plans?

09:38.231 --> 09:39.594
See, I’m getting through it
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwith small talk.

09:39.594 --> 09:42.396
JULIA: (laughs)
Um, actually, I’m cooking,

09:42.396 --> 09:44.528
which might seem normal,
but for me,

09:44.528 --> 09:46.033
it’s something very new.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.726
\h\h\h\h\hMy kids are going
to their grandparents’

09:47.726 --> 09:49.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hin Florida
for the long weekend,

09:49.264 --> 09:51.198
so I’m doing nothing.

09:51.198 --> 09:52.528
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo, no, no,
don’t look at me like that.

09:52.528 --> 09:54.033
It’s not sad.

09:54.033 --> 09:55.462
Okay, I’ve got the whole house
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hto myself.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.957

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYeah,
maybe it is a little sad.

10:00.462 --> 10:02.363
Come to my house.
It’ll be fun.

10:02.363 --> 10:04.297
I don’t want to step
\h\h\h\h\h\hon your plans.

10:04.297 --> 10:05.759
No, no, I want you there.

10:05.759 --> 10:07.957
I’m starting a new tradition.

10:07.957 --> 10:10.891
And I know that’s not a thing,
because by definition,

10:10.891 --> 10:12.462
a tradition is
not something new.

10:12.462 --> 10:14.627
\h\h\h\h\hWho told you that?
Of course it’s a thing.

10:14.627 --> 10:17.495
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hEvery tradition
has to start sometime.

10:17.495 --> 10:19.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhat?

15:46.264 --> 15:48.330
\h\h\h\h\hSomeone brought it up
at the staff meeting and--

15:48.330 --> 15:50.462
-Someone?
\h\h-Me.

15:50.462 --> 15:53.264
\hAnd everyone agreed with me
that until the case is over,

15:53.264 --> 15:56.000
we need to distance ourselves
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfrom the scandal,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.792
um, especially after
that article--

15:57.792 --> 15:59.627
Well, you don’t have to keep
\h\h\hbringing up that article.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.429
-It’s optics.
\h\h\h-Yeah.

16:01.429 --> 16:03.594
-Just giving us some distance--
\h\h\h\h\h-You said that, yeah.

16:03.594 --> 16:05.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Okay.
-I mean, who am I to disagree?

16:05.759 --> 16:08.825
I’m the one who, uh, you know,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hcaused all this damage.

16:08.825 --> 16:11.561
You’re not upset?

16:11.561 --> 16:13.330
No, I understand.

16:13.330 --> 16:16.660
You know, it’s good thinking,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hgood optics.

16:17.924 --> 16:21.462
I, uh--you know, I-I actually
\h\h\h\h\h\hwanted to, uh, tell you

16:21.462 --> 16:23.363
I’ve changed my mind.

16:23.363 --> 16:26.165
I’d--I’d like to come
\h\h\h\h\hto Thanksgiving.

16:26.165 --> 16:28.792
-T-to my house?
\h\h\h-Mm-hmm.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.660
For...?

16:30.660 --> 16:32.297
G-great.
That’s great.

16:32.297 --> 16:33.297
-What can I bring?
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Great.

16:33.297 --> 16:34.363
Are you sure?

16:34.363 --> 16:36.462
Because--because it seemed like

16:36.462 --> 16:39.297
you felt pretty strongly
about not changing traditions.

16:39.297 --> 16:40.825
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYeah, no, but I--
you know, I thought about it,

16:40.825 --> 16:42.792
\h\h\h\hand I--you know,
you had a good point

16:42.792 --> 16:46.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\habout change
and my resistance to it.

16:46.165 --> 16:48.627
Because I have some
pretty big changes planned,

16:48.627 --> 16:51.198
like, curry spices.

16:51.198 --> 16:53.231
Julia, are you trying
\h\hto now disinvite me

16:53.231 --> 16:54.561
from Thanksgiving?

16:54.561 --> 16:58.198
No, I-I-I’m happy
you’re gonna be there.

16:58.198 --> 17:01.660
You can bring wine...

17:01.660 --> 17:03.759
lots of it.

17:08.396 --> 17:09.627
EDIE: So nice
to finally be able

17:09.627 --> 17:11.000
to show you guys
around the office.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.462
I have lots more ideas for it--

17:12.462 --> 17:16.066
more art on the walls,
ergonomic chairs.

17:16.066 --> 17:17.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou can do
whatever you want to the place

17:17.561 --> 17:19.231
when you make partner.

17:19.231 --> 17:22.561
We’re very proud of you both,
\h\h\h\hbut especially Edie.

17:22.561 --> 17:25.198
For a woman to be lead counsel

17:25.198 --> 17:27.429
in a high-profile case
\h\h\h\h\hat this firm,

17:27.429 --> 17:28.759
that’s an accomplishment.

17:28.759 --> 17:30.495
Well, I wouldn’t have
\h\h\h\h\hthis opportunity

17:30.495 --> 17:32.561
\hwithout women like you
paving the way, Gladys.

17:32.561 --> 17:34.594
My ceiling was
a lot lower than yours.

17:34.594 --> 17:36.759
The sky’s the limit
for you, my dear.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.759
You’re definitely the one
to watch.

17:38.759 --> 17:40.660
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Oh.
-She’s the one to watch?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.891
-TIM: Wow, Mom, thanks.
\h-Yeah, you heard her.

17:42.891 --> 17:44.759
\h\h\h\hYou know what?
I think I need a drink

17:44.759 --> 17:45.759
after that ego boost.

17:45.759 --> 17:47.396
Uh-uh, don’t you dare.

17:47.396 --> 17:50.231
That Cognac will be opened
after Thanksgiving dessert.

17:50.231 --> 17:52.066
Tradition.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.231
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMay I ask,
why are we having dinner

17:54.231 --> 17:58.924
\h\h\h\h\hat Julia Bechley’s
and not in your lovely home?

17:58.924 --> 18:00.033
You want to field that one?

18:00.033 --> 18:02.429
Well, Mom and I have shared

18:02.429 --> 18:04.561
a lot of holiday dinners
\h\h\h\hwith the Bechleys

18:04.561 --> 18:08.198
over the years, and I just
\hthought it would be nice

18:08.198 --> 18:11.033
if we were all together,
\h\h\h\h\hone big family.

18:11.033 --> 18:13.660
-(cell phone chimes)
\h\h\h\h\h-Excuse me.

18:15.363 --> 18:18.231
\h\h\h\h\h\hTIM:
It should be fun.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.528
GLADYS:
\h\hMm.

18:20.528 --> 18:22.957
The more, the merrier, right?

18:22.957 --> 18:24.891
Lunch?

18:24.891 --> 18:27.726
\h\h\h\hSo I’ve been replaying
the moment you saw the mock-ups

18:27.726 --> 18:29.363
for the new clinic name
\h\h\h\h\h\hin my head,

18:29.363 --> 18:31.066
and the only reason
that you would be

18:31.066 --> 18:33.264
so uncharacteristically chill
about it

18:33.264 --> 18:35.066
is if you were
way more upset about it

18:35.066 --> 18:36.396
than I even thought you were.

18:36.396 --> 18:38.792
So, that being said,
let me have it.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.330
Dad, unleash,

18:40.330 --> 18:42.891
’cause I can’t go into
Thanksgiving feeling guilty.

18:42.891 --> 18:44.792
This holiday means
way too much to me.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.957
(sighs)

18:46.957 --> 18:49.330
\h\h\h\h\hYou have nothing
to feel guilty about.

18:49.330 --> 18:52.627
\h\h\h\hI mean, I’m the one
who should feel guilty.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.231
Unless...

18:58.066 --> 18:59.891
What else do you need
to tell me?

18:59.891 --> 19:02.594
(sighs)

19:02.594 --> 19:04.594
I’m dating someone.

19:04.594 --> 19:06.627
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHis name is Donovan.
He’s a public-school teacher.

19:06.627 --> 19:08.792
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHe has two kids.
He’s coming to Thanksgiving.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.033
\h\hAnd I know you’re gonna
disarticulate the turkey,

19:11.033 --> 19:12.759
\h\hbut please don’t
disarticulate him,

19:12.759 --> 19:13.759
because I like him.

19:13.759 --> 19:15.429
I-I actually like him,

19:15.429 --> 19:17.033
and I really, really don’t
\h\h\h\h\hwant to mess this up.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.924
Um, what are you thinking?

19:18.924 --> 19:21.759
-He has two children?
-Teenagers, actually.

19:21.759 --> 19:23.429
They’re with their grandparents
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor the holiday.

19:23.429 --> 19:27.099
\h\h-How old is he?
-Age appropriate...

19:27.099 --> 19:29.759
-and not my brother.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Hmm.

19:29.759 --> 19:31.264
A step in the right direction.

19:31.264 --> 19:34.264
Are you sure that you want
to, you know,

19:34.264 --> 19:38.297
give up the chance of parenting
children of your own

19:38.297 --> 19:39.858
for this guy?

19:39.858 --> 19:41.627
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWho said anything
about giving up anything?

19:41.627 --> 19:44.033
Yeah, well, you know,
a man with two teenagers

19:44.033 --> 19:46.066
likely doesn’t want
to go through raising

19:46.066 --> 19:47.693
another kid again.

19:47.693 --> 19:51.132
\h\hWell, Donovan and I have
already talked about that,

19:51.132 --> 19:53.825
and you don’t need to worry.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.693
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd--and, frankly,
it’s none of your business.

19:55.693 --> 19:59.066
Well, I mean, it has been,
you know, my specialty

19:59.066 --> 20:00.561
for several decades.

20:00.561 --> 20:03.066
Dad, I know how you get
\h\h\hwhen I date someone.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.528
No one is ever good enough
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor you.

20:04.528 --> 20:06.792
No, no, not true.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.561
Not good enough for you.

20:09.891 --> 20:12.594
Um, Donovan, is it?

20:12.594 --> 20:14.561
Nice name.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.000
Hmm.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.561
Well, now I’m really
looking forward to this.

20:18.561 --> 20:20.660
<i>(bright music)</i>

20:20.660 --> 20:22.759
(sirens wail distantly)

20:22.759 --> 20:24.264
Did Tim ever tell you
\h\h\h\h\h\h\habout the time

20:24.264 --> 20:26.231
I introduced him to my dad?

20:26.231 --> 20:29.429
\h\h\h\hMy dad had him shaking
in his Converse high-tops.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.594
\h\hI can’t believe how hard
it’s gonna be for Donovan.

20:31.594 --> 20:34.396
Wait,
Tim wore high-top Converse?

20:34.396 --> 20:36.528
\h\h\hYou didn’t see
his grunge phase?

20:36.528 --> 20:38.495
I did not.

20:38.495 --> 20:42.066
Anyway, Donovan can either
handle Leon or he can’t.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.726
Either way, you’ll know.

20:43.726 --> 20:45.726
That’s not comforting.

20:45.726 --> 20:48.066
(cell phone chimes)

20:48.066 --> 20:50.363
It’s Amanda’s son
Lorenzo again.

20:50.363 --> 20:52.594
How many sad faces this time?

20:52.594 --> 20:54.264
(sighs)

20:54.264 --> 20:58.033
A lot.
I don’t know what to do.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.561
If I don’t text him back,
it’s cruel.

20:59.561 --> 21:01.924
If I do text him back,
it’s even crueler.

21:01.924 --> 21:03.957
It’s like I’m leading them
both on.

21:03.957 --> 21:05.759
\hDon’t take it out
on my green beans.

21:05.759 --> 21:09.363
I-I love Tim.
I love his family.

21:09.363 --> 21:12.099
The right thing to do--the only
thing to do is work on it.

21:12.099 --> 21:13.957
-Marriage is work.
-It is. It’s work.

21:13.957 --> 21:15.429
-You keep saying "work."
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yep.

21:15.429 --> 21:16.627
Yes, I know.

21:16.627 --> 21:18.066
\h\h-(laughter)
-(door closes)

21:18.066 --> 21:19.660
\h\h\h\hHey.
Hey, Julesy!

21:19.660 --> 21:22.231
Hi.
Who’s this?

21:22.231 --> 21:24.594
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hROXY: Oh.
HANNAH: This place is dope.

21:24.594 --> 21:26.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHow many, uh,
bedrooms are upstairs?

21:26.165 --> 21:28.957
Oh, just two,
but the couch is super comfy.

21:28.957 --> 21:30.429
HANNAH: Hey, Roxy, guess what.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hROXY: What?

21:30.429 --> 21:34.099
\h-Chicken butt.
-(both laughing)

21:34.099 --> 21:36.792
Oh, my God, she’s been
getting me all day with that.

21:36.792 --> 21:40.330
You guys, this is Hannah.
She’s our new sister.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.297
BOTH: Oh.
-(laughs)

21:42.297 --> 21:43.594
\h\h\h\h-Hi.
-ROXY: Yeah.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.660
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJulia, Edie,
you guys are, like,

21:46.660 --> 21:48.264
so much skinnier in person.

21:48.264 --> 21:49.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h-(snorts)
-(softly) Thank you.

21:49.429 --> 21:51.297
Hey, Hannah,

21:51.297 --> 21:52.627
uh, where did you come from?

21:52.627 --> 21:54.792
She came from the Internet.

21:54.792 --> 21:56.132
That’s where she found me.

21:56.132 --> 21:57.594
But she’s actually
\h\h\hfrom Chicago.

21:57.594 --> 21:58.957
She’s staying here
a few extra days

21:58.957 --> 22:00.627
so she can join us
for T-giving.

22:00.627 --> 22:02.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(laughs)
-Oh, that’s good news.

22:02.759 --> 22:03.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Wow.
-JULIA: By the way,

22:03.924 --> 22:05.264
did you stop by the clinic?

22:05.264 --> 22:06.594
’Cause I would love for us

22:06.594 --> 22:08.000
to get your information and...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.660
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(snorts)
Wow, you totally called that.

22:10.660 --> 22:11.924
-(laughs)
\h-Right?

22:11.924 --> 22:13.594
\h\h\hCalled what?
What did she call?

22:13.594 --> 22:15.099
What are these?

22:15.099 --> 22:17.264
Uh, is there a ladies’ room
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI can use?

22:17.264 --> 22:19.099
Oh, yeah, the one downstairs
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\his really crummy,

22:19.099 --> 22:20.693
\hso I’ll show you
the one upstairs.

22:20.693 --> 22:22.099
I’m gonna have these.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.693
"Hello, I’m Gary
the ginger man."

22:24.693 --> 22:25.957
Off we go!

22:25.957 --> 22:27.891
There’s a stranger using
my bathroom.

there are two of them now.
