11:53.582 --> 11:55.192
YOU SURE? INTERESTING.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.500
JANE?HI.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.197
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HYPNOTIZE HER?

12:00.284 --> 12:03.331
HYPNOTIZE ME?I TOLD YOU NO!
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT

12:03.418 --> 12:07.161
HER MEMORY WILL COME BACK
ON ITS OWN IN TIME!WHOA, WHOA. BACK OFF, TIGER.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.990
EASY, ALRIGHT?
I DID NO SUCH THING.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.992
WAIT. WHY WOULD HE WANT
TO HYPNOTIZE ME?

12:12.079 --> 12:15.691
HONEY... [sighs]

12:15.778 --> 12:17.519
WHY WON'T ANYONE TALK TO ME?

12:22.002 --> 12:24.961
AUNT JODIE, WHERE'S MY DAD?

12:25.048 --> 12:27.572
TRINA...

12:27.659 --> 12:29.923
HE HASN'T COME TO SEE ME.
WHERE IS HE?

12:39.323 --> 12:42.587
H-HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE?

12:42.674 --> 12:45.895
JUST TELL ME, PLEASE.

12:45.982 --> 12:49.812
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S DEAD.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.596
W--

12:51.683 --> 12:53.207
I'M SORRY.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.513
HE WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.085
OH, HONEY. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL--I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.130
[crying]

13:03.217 --> 13:05.828
IT'S OKAY. SHH. SHH.

13:08.178 --> 13:10.877
HI. I TRIED TO FIND YOU
THIS MORNING.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.227
YEAH, I'M NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD FOR TALKING.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.795
I GET IT, BUT IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND--GRACE.

13:15.882 --> 13:20.756
CRAIG. [sighs]HEY, I CAME AS SOON
AS I COULD. YOU OKAY?

13:20.843 --> 13:24.064
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.GOOD. ME NEITHER. WHAT'S UP?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.892
ADRIAN ESSEX HAS
A NUMBER ONE ENFORCER--

13:25.979 --> 13:28.024
EUGENE BODEN, SUSPECTED
IN NUMBER OF MURDERS.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.548
HE COULD STILL ORDER THE HIT.LET'S GO.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.376
YOU'RE BEING TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF, OKAY?

13:32.463 --> 13:33.987
THE KILLER COULD'VE
PICKED THAT LOCK.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.337
HE COULD'VE HAD
A KEY, FOR ALL YOU KNOW.

13:36.424 --> 13:40.123
OR HE DIDN'T NEED A KEY, BECAUSE
I MAYBE LEFT IT UNLOCKED.

13:40.210 --> 13:43.692
I LOST A WITNESS, CRAIG.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.260
YOU'RE A GREAT COP.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.957
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.959
I'M LOOKING.

13:50.046 --> 13:53.310
THIS WILL PASS. I PROMISE.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.401
I'M INTERRUPTING.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.621
[chuckles]

13:59.708 --> 14:01.971
AGENT LaROCHE
OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS,

14:02.058 --> 14:05.757
THIS IS CRAIG O'LAUGHLIN, FBI.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.935
THE P.S.U. IS LOOKING
INTO LAST NIGHT'S INCIDENT.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.981
THERE ARE SOME... QUESTIONS.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.854
I'VE SCHEDULED US TO MEET
THIS AFTERNOON.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.595
I WILL NEED
YOUR INCIDENT REPORT

14:17.682 --> 14:20.642
AND A URINE SAMPLE
TO SCREEN FOR DRUGS.

14:20.729 --> 14:25.212
AGENT DUBIN HERE WILL
ESCORT YOU TO THE RESTROOM.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.343
RIGHT NOW?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.389

14:31.305 --> 14:34.090
UH, NICE MEETING YOU.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.056
[door creaks]

14:43.143 --> 14:44.361

14:44.448 --> 14:46.711
[EUGENE] JOEY, QUICK.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
[lock clicks]OH.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.977

14:58.810 --> 15:02.771

15:18.961 --> 15:21.268
I GOT IT. GO.OKAY.

15:21.355 --> 15:24.184
POLICE! STOP!

15:24.271 --> 15:27.013
[car alert chirps,
opens and closes door]

15:27.100 --> 15:28.449
ESSEX, STOP![engine starts]

15:31.931 --> 15:33.019
[panting] DAMN!

15:37.632 --> 15:40.417
[paper rustling]

15:44.508 --> 15:46.597
YOU LOOK ANXIOUS.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.469
[chuckles] NOT AT ALL.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.297
NO?

15:50.384 --> 15:53.256
IT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE.

15:53.343 --> 15:56.346
AGENT VAN PELT...

15:56.433 --> 15:58.827
DID YOU LEAVE
THAT DOOR UNLOCKED?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.092
I DON'T KNOW.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.268
THAT MUST BE DISTRESSING,

16:05.355 --> 16:07.879
NOT KNOWING IF YOU'RE
A GOOD COP OR NOT.

16:14.234 --> 16:18.412
YOU REMEMBER TODD JOHNSON,
DON'T YOU?

16:18.499 --> 16:22.416
COP KILLER MURDERED HERE
IN OUR HOUSE BY ONE OF US.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.287
WHY?

16:24.374 --> 16:26.855
I NEED ASSISTANCE
WITH MY INVESTIGATION

16:26.942 --> 16:29.510
INTO HIS MURDER.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.861
I NEED SOMEONE TRUSTWORTHY.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.037
ASSISTANCE?

16:35.124 --> 16:36.343
YOU HAVE A WHOLE UNIT.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.823
I NEED YOU.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.565
ME?

16:41.652 --> 16:43.002
DO YOU HAVE A SUSPECT?

16:45.439 --> 16:47.223
IS IT SOMEONE I WORK WITH?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.138
[file rustles]

16:49.225 --> 16:52.489
WE'LL DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS
AT A LATER POINT,

16:52.576 --> 16:54.535
BUT ESSENTIALLY
ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO

16:54.622 --> 16:59.061
IS KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,
AND AT A LATER POINT,

16:59.148 --> 17:02.369
YOU MIGHT BE ASKED
TO WEAR A WIRE.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.240
[chuckles]

17:04.327 --> 17:06.634
YOU WANT ME TO SPY
ON MY OWN DEPARTMENT?

17:06.721 --> 17:09.941
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO REDEEM YOURSELF, AGENT,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.553
TO PROVE YOU ARE A GOOD COP,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.511
THAT YOU WILL TAKE DOWN
A KILLER,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.165
NO MATTER WHO IT IS.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.778
AND, OF COURSE,

17:20.865 --> 17:23.477
IT WOULD MAKE
MY INVESTIGATION

17:23.564 --> 17:27.785
OF YOUR ACTIONS
MUCH EASIER,

17:27.872 --> 17:29.657
BECAUSE A GOOD COP

17:29.744 --> 17:32.921
COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE LEFT
A DOOR UNLOCKED

17:33.008 --> 17:35.228
AND LET A WITNESS BE KILLED

17:35.315 --> 17:38.144
IN FRONT
OF HIS OWN DAUGHTER.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.972
AM I RIGHT?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.670
[chuckles]
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

17:42.757 --> 17:47.240
I'M PRESENTING YOU
WITH OPTIONS, AGENT.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.416
TAKE SOME TIME
AND MULL THEM OVER.

17:57.206 --> 18:00.905
YOUR BOSS IS SMART.
ESSEX HAD THIS PHONE REWIRED

18:00.992 --> 18:03.343
TO HAVE THE SAME SIGNAL
AS THE ANKLE MONITOR.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.562
TURN THE PHONE ON,
LEAVE IT AT HOME,

18:05.649 --> 18:07.260
EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU'RE STILL THERE.

18:07.347 --> 18:10.828
BUT ESSEX FORGOT ONE THING--
HIS NEIGHBOR'S SECURITY CAM.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.788
ESSEX ALSO LEFT HIS HOUSE
THE NIGHT OF DeGEORGE'S MURDER.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.573
IT MAKES HIM LOOK PRETTY GOOD
FOR IT, DON'T YOU THINK?

18:16.660 --> 18:18.836
LOVELY.
SO I GUESS I CAN GO THEN.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.274
I THINK HE'S FORGETTING
THAT HE TRIED TO BUY

18:21.361 --> 18:23.798
20 POUNDS OF METH
FROM THE CONNERA FAMILY.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.931
MUST BE. WHAT KIND OF
PRICE TAG DOES THAT CARRY?20 YEARS.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.760
WON'T BE TOO BAD. I HEAR
THEY'RE GETTING HBO IN FOLSOM.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.546
GET TO THE POINT, MARY.YOU AND ESSEX--
CAME UP TOGETHER.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.809
BEEN PULLING JOBS
WITH HIM FOR THE 10 YEARS.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.550
YOU KNOW WHERE HE HIDES.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.902
YOU GIVE US ESSEX, WE CAN DEAL.
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 20 YEARS.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.865
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THAT... HBO.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.915
[siren wailing]HOSPITAL?
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

18:54.002 --> 18:57.223
NO, I KNOW AUNT JODIE HAD
BANNED ME FROM THE HOSPITAL.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.616
QUITE MILITARISTIC OF HER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:59.703 --> 19:02.793
OH. GOTTA RUN. GOTTA RUN.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.231
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME
AT THIS HOSPITAL, MR. JANE.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.494
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT
I'D FIND YOU OUT HERE,

19:07.581 --> 19:10.018
AMONGST YOUR, UH,
PUFFING PEOPLE.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.368
YOU'RE TRYING SO HARD
TO QUIT SMOKING.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.328
YOU BITE YOUR NAILS,
AND YOU SMELL OF HAND SANITIZER,

19:15.415 --> 19:18.374
BUT YOU ARE TRYING TO QUIT
FOR TRINA, WHICH IS ADMIRABLE.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.898
WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU ARE
NOT HYPNOTIZING MY NIECE.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.205
NO, NO, NO.
NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.207
I'M JUST GOING DOWN
THROUGH THE SUSPECT LIST,

19:25.294 --> 19:28.819
STARTING WITH "A"
FOR "AUNT JODIE."

19:28.906 --> 19:31.692
YOU THINK I KILLED JUSTIN?!
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

19:31.779 --> 19:35.217
NO. YOU'RE SELF-POSSESSED.
YOU'RE STRONG-WILLED.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.958
YOU BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE
CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS--

19:37.045 --> 19:38.655
THAT'S THE ARMY THING.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.875
I'M A SOLDIER,
SO I KILLED HIM?

19:40.962 --> 19:42.485
WELL, YOU DESPISED HIM.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.922
YOU HAD ZERO REACTION
TO HIS DEATH.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.446
FORGIVE ME
FOR BEING MORE CONCERNED

19:46.533 --> 19:51.320
WITH THE WELFARE
OF MY NIECE.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.408
GO AHEAD. LIGHT UP.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.019
THERE'S NO JUDGMENT HERE.
GO ON.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.891
[sniffles][lighter clicks]

19:56.978 --> 20:00.764
WHY DIDN'T YOU LIKE HIM?

20:00.851 --> 20:03.463
JUSTIN BEAT MY SISTER.

20:03.550 --> 20:07.031
HE'D GET DRUNK
AND SLAP HER AROUND.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.817
I WAS OVERSEAS.
I COULDN'T PROTECT HER.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.036
SO, YES, I DID HATE HIM.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.864
WHEN MOLLY...

20:13.951 --> 20:16.171
[voice breaks]
WHEN SHE DIED, I MOVED HERE.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.652
I WAS GOING TO FIGHT HIM
FOR CUSTODY OF TRINA.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.829
[clicks]

20:21.916 --> 20:23.396
[click]

20:23.483 --> 20:25.702
SO THERE YOU GO.
MAYBE I DID HAVE MOTIVE

20:25.789 --> 20:27.922
FOR KILLING THE BASTARD.
[exhales deeply]

20:28.009 --> 20:29.402
MM. NICE LIGHTER.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.234
YOUR SISTER MOLLY--

20:35.321 --> 20:36.931
WHERE DID YOU SAY
SHE DIED?

20:37.018 --> 20:38.759
A NO-TELL MOTEL IN RENO.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.543
IT'S PATHETIC.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.243
[voice breaks]
A HOPELESS PLACE
TO KILL YOURSELF.

20:44.330 --> 20:48.769
I WAS SO ANGRY
AT HER FOR THAT.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.206
I'M SORRY, JODIE.
I SEEM TO HAVE MISJUDGED YOU.

20:51.293 --> 20:56.472
PLEASE LET ME MAKE AMENDS.
LOOK AT ME.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.432
EVERY TIME YOU BREATHE
A BREATH OF THAT PUTRID SMOKE,

20:59.519 --> 21:00.955
REMEMBER THIS.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.914
THERE'S A FAT,
RICH TOBACCO EXECUTIVE

21:04.001 --> 21:06.352
THINKING WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE,

21:06.439 --> 21:08.789
EVERY TIME YOU BREATHE
THAT SMOKE,

21:08.876 --> 21:10.704
LAUGHING AT YOU,

21:10.791 --> 21:14.273
WITH HIS FAT JOWLS
WOBBLING WITH GLEE.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.362
DO YOU SEE HIM?

21:16.449 --> 21:18.102
UH-HUH.

21:28.722 --> 21:29.897
[utensils clinking]

21:29.984 --> 21:32.769
[both chuckle]

21:32.856 --> 21:34.858
OH. SORRY.
I DIDN'T ORDER THAT.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.120
NO, I-I DID.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.688
THANK YOU.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.995
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE. COME ON.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.563
AND CHOCOLATE ALWAYS MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER WHEN YOU'RE UPSET.

21:43.650 --> 21:47.044
MM-HMM. I NEED TO WORK

21:47.131 --> 21:50.918
YEP. I'M BETTING IT'S LaROCHE.

21:51.005 --> 21:54.008
HMM? SPILL.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.837
PASS THAT OVER HERE.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.281
HE WANTS ME
TO SPY ON MY DEPARTMENT,

22:06.368 --> 22:08.762
OR HE'LL GO AFTER ME.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.634
IS THIS ABOUT
THAT COP-KILLER MURDER?

22:11.721 --> 22:13.984
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.552
I'M SORRY, BABE.

22:16.639 --> 22:20.513
THIS IS NEVER FUN, BUT, LOOK,
SOMEONE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION

22:20.600 --> 22:23.167
SET A MAN ON FIRE
AND LET HIM BURN ALIVE.

22:23.254 --> 22:26.780
IF YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS,
WOULDN'T YOU TURN HIM IN ANYWAY?

22:26.867 --> 22:28.434
YEAH, I GUESS I WOULD.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.219
OKAY. WELL, ISN'T THAT ALL
LaROCHE IS ASKING YOU TO DO,

22:31.306 --> 22:34.353
TO CATCH THE GUY?CRAIG, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.921
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WEAR A WIRE
WHILE I TALK TO A FRIEND?

22:38.008 --> 22:39.836
THEY'RE YOUR COLLEAGUES,
OKAY?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.751

22:41.838 --> 22:45.755
I'M THE ONE WHO'S HERE

22:45.842 --> 22:46.800
I GET IT.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.758
IT'S A TOUGH CALL.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.021
OKAY,
SO WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,

22:51.108 --> 22:53.676

23:16.438 --> 23:18.658
YEAH, AND GUESS

23:18.745 --> 23:20.399
DeGEORGE CALLED
THE POLICE LAST YEAR,

23:20.486 --> 23:22.270
CLAIMED THAT TRINA'S
AUNT JODIE ATTACKED HIM.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.403
NOT SURPRISING.
HE ABUSED HER SISTER.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.317
SAYS WHO? RECORDS SAY
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.145
WELL, THAT'S RECORDS FOR YOU.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.931
OH, THERE'S STUFF IN HERE ABOUT
TRINA'S MOTHER. EXCELLENT.

23:31.018 --> 23:34.500
ANY LEADS ON ESSEX YET?
MY C.I.s ARE ALL QUIET AS MICE.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.893
RIGSBY'S GOT SQUAT.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.722
C.H.P, BORDER PATROLS,
AIRPORTS--

23:39.809 --> 23:41.550
THEY'VE ALL GOT PICTURES.
WE'VE GOTTA WAIT.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.813
I'M ALSO GETTING A WARRANT OUT
ON ESSEX'S FINANCES.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.859
IFHE PAID FOR THE HITON DeGEORGE,

23:45.946 --> 23:47.687
THEN MAYBE WE HAVE A TRAIL.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.341
YOU KNOW IT WAS ILLEGAL TO
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS IN BOSTON.

23:50.429 --> 23:55.042
PILGRIMS THOUGHT THE WHOLE
SPECTACLE RATHER DEBAUCHED.[chuckles] DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.697
GOT SOMETHING. A LIST
OF EVERY PROPERTY ESSEX OWNS.

23:57.784 --> 24:02.005
GOOD PLACE TO START LOOKING.GREAT. I'LL GET MY GUYS ON IT.
SHOULD TAKE A COUPLE HOURS.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.052
SOUNDS A LITTLE TEDIOUS.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A PEEK?

24:05.139 --> 24:08.229
CAN GET THEM IN A LINEUP,
AND SEE WHO'S THE KILLER.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.840
A LINEUP FOR WHO, TRINA?
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.800
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS CERTAIN
STIMULUS CAN JOG MEMORIES.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.366
GREAT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ESSEX.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.412
GOT $100 THAT SAYS
I CAN FIGURE OUT

24:17.499 --> 24:19.849
WHERE ESSEX IS IN LESS
THAN A MINUTE.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.372
PASS.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.505
A MINUTE.CAN I GET IN ON THIS?

24:23.592 --> 24:26.769

24:44.091 --> 24:46.833

24:49.226 --> 24:51.925
RELAXES YOU, SOOTHES YOU.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.709

25:08.463 --> 25:09.943
COME ON. NO WAY.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.249
WHEN I PUT MY FINGER
OVER THE CORRECT ADDRESS,

25:12.336 --> 25:13.860
BODEN COULDN'T HELP
BUT REACT.

25:13.947 --> 25:17.820

27:13.240 --> 27:15.416
I WANT TO MAKE OUR POSITION
CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.200
WE ARE NOT INTERESTED
IN A PLEA.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.463
MY CLIENT IS INNOCENT
OF EVERY CHARGE.

27:19.550 --> 27:20.987
THAT RIGHT?

27:21.074 --> 27:23.903
SURE, ADRIAN HAD THE ABILITY
TO LEAVE HIS HOUSE,

27:23.990 --> 27:26.949
BUT IN NO WAY DOES THAT PROVE
THAT HE KILLED JUSTIN DeGEORGE.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.995
HE SNUCK OUT THE NIGHT
OF THE MURDER.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.737
MY GIRLFRIEND HURT HER BACK.
SHE'LL SWEAR TO IT.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.739
NATURALLY.
THERE'S ALSO A DRUG CHARGE.

27:33.826 --> 27:37.090
20 POUNDS OF METH
IN THAT HOUSE.ADRIAN WASN'T IN THE SAME ROOM.

27:37.177 --> 27:41.181
MR. BODEN WILL TESTIFY HE
HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE DRUGS.YOUR CLIENT EVADED ARREST.

27:41.268 --> 27:45.533
ONLY AFTER THE CBI AGENTS
ILLEGALLY FORCED THEIR WAY IN.THAT WAS BY THE BOOK.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.535
THAT'S DEBATABLE.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.059
THERE WERE NO DRUGS
IN PLAIN SIGHT,

27:50.146 --> 27:51.974
NO EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES
TO ENTER THE HOME.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.541
TRUST ME.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.804
I GET MUCH BETTER EVIDENCE
THROWN OUT EVERY DAY

27:57.980 --> 28:00.461
NEED TO PUT TRINA
IN FRONT OF A LINEUP.

28:00.548 --> 28:03.072
WE'VE GOT BOTH BODEN
AND ESSEX IN CUSTODY.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.596

THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.

WHAT IS HE DOING? COULD YOU
PLEASE CONTROL YOUR MAN?

28:28.837 --> 28:33.842
OH, BELIEVE ME, SHE'S TRIED.I-I THINK A LINEUP IS
A RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.104
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

28:35.191 --> 28:38.107
A LINEUP MIGHT JOG HER MEMORY.

28:38.194 --> 28:42.416
HI, TRINA. YOU WANNA I.D.
YOUR FATHER'S KILLER?

28:42.503 --> 28:45.462
D-DID YOU JUST ASK HER
TO COME DOWN HERE?

28:45.549 --> 28:47.551
THIS IS... UNCONSCIONABLE.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.423
ON THE CONTRARY,
IT'S TOTALLY CONSCIONABLE.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.425
WE CAN CONSCION THIS
VERY EASILY.

28:51.512 --> 28:52.992
I'LL DO IT.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.645

33:35.361 --> 33:38.233
I AM A GOOD COP.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.669
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

33:42.672 --> 33:46.502

AND AS TO
THE OTHER MATTER,

33:48.809 --> 33:50.680
I DECLINE YOUR OFFER.

33:50.767 --> 33:54.423
I WON'T SPY ON MY FRIENDS.

33:54.510 --> 33:58.253

33:58.340 --> 34:01.169
EVERY DAY YOU PASS
EACH OTHER IN THE HALLS.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.476
YOU SHARE INFORMATION.

34:03.563 --> 34:07.654
YOU MIGHT WELL PUT YOUR LIFE
INTO THIS PERSON'S HANDS.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.525
I FIND THAT BOTHERSOME,

34:09.612 --> 34:11.440

34:34.985 --> 34:37.292
YEAH. ALRIGHT.YEAH?

34:37.379 --> 34:39.554
[Lisbon]
YOU PAID GORMAN
TO KILL JUSTIN,

34:39.641 --> 34:41.862
AND WHEN YOU REALIZED
TRINA COULD I.D. GORMAN,

34:41.949 --> 34:45.300
YOU PUT A HIT OUT ON HER.YEAH, LIKE YOU CAN PROVE THAT.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.128
DID YOU GET THIS
FROM THE GIRL?

34:47.215 --> 34:49.913
ANYTHING SHE SAYS UNDER
HYPNOSIS IS INADMISSIBLE.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.134
OH. OH. NO, NO, NO.
I NEVER HYPNOTIZED TRINA.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.702
MUCH TO THE RELIEF
OF HER AUNT, I MUST SAY,

34:55.789 --> 34:57.486
TRINA NEVER REMEMBERED ANYTHING.

34:57.573 --> 35:01.142
I DID IT TO LURE GORMAN OUT,
AND IT WORKED A TREAT.

35:01.229 --> 35:04.450
AND WE DO HAVE THE PROOF,
AND NOT JUST THE BAG OF METH

35:04.537 --> 35:07.975
WE FOUND AT GORMAN'S,
BUT ALSO YOUR BANK RECORDS.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.325
YOU PAID GORMAN 10 GRAND
FOR EACH HIT.

35:10.412 --> 35:11.892
EVERY TIME GORMAN MAD
A DEPOSIT,

35:11.979 --> 35:13.937
THE SAME AMOUNT CAME OUT
OF YOUR ACCOUNT.

35:14.024 --> 35:17.027
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?IN THE SIX YEARS
GORMAN WORKED FOR YOU,

35:17.115 --> 35:19.465
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
COMMISSIONED FIVE MURDERS.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.207
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GONNA
CLOSE SOME OPEN CASES.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.731
I THINK HE'S GONNA LOOK
GREAT IN AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.560
IF THE GIRL SAID NOTHING,
HOW'D YOU GET ON TO GORMAN?

35:27.647 --> 35:31.520
THAT LOVELY HOCKEY JERSEY.
YOU'RE FROM BOSTON. OH, COME ON.

35:31.607 --> 35:34.958
IT'S WICKED OBVIOUS.
GORMAN'S ALSO FROM BOSTON.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.309
YOU GUYS EVEN GREW UP
ON THE SAME BLOCK.

35:37.396 --> 35:40.181

35:55.805 --> 35:58.286
RIGHT. SORRY. I THOUGHT...

35:58.373 --> 36:00.723
THOUGHT WHAT?

36:00.810 --> 36:02.769
[sighs]
I THOUGHT
YOU HEARD MY NEWS ALREADY,

36:02.856 --> 36:06.076
AND I REALLY WANTED
TO TELL YOU MYSELF.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.997
CRAIG ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM,
AND I SAID YES. [chuckles]

36:19.612 --> 36:21.570
THAT'S WONDERFUL, GRACE.
[chuckles]

36:21.657 --> 36:25.922
THAT'S TERRIFIC NEWS.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

36:26.009 --> 36:28.098
[chuckles]
THANK YOU, WAYNE.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.839

36:32.407 --> 36:33.365
[whispers] THANKS.
[chuckles]

36:33.452 --> 36:35.149
[whispers] YEAH.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.933
[chuckles]

36:46.291 --> 36:48.728
HI. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.208
NO. I BROUGHT LISBON ALONG

36:50.295 --> 36:51.992
ON ACCOUNT OF
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,

36:52.079 --> 36:53.646
DESPITE I HELPED HER
QUIT SMOKING.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.691
NOW THAT'S GRATITUDE.

36:55.778 --> 36:56.779
IN THERE.

36:56.866 --> 36:59.913
NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.915
[door closes]

37:06.876 --> 37:09.270
YOU REMEMBER NOW,
DON'T YOU?

37:09.357 --> 37:11.229
REMEMBER WHAT?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.885
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN SAY.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.061
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.022
[voice breaking]
I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.679
I DID IT.

37:26.766 --> 37:30.683
IT WAS ME.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.728
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

37:32.815 --> 37:35.296
IT WAS TRINA
WHO SHOT HER FATHER.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.691
[scoffs] NO. NO.
THAT MARSHAL SHOT JUSTIN.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.867
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.478
WELL, TECHNICALLY GORMAN WAS
HIREDTO KILL JUSTIN.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.350
[Patrick]
HE SNUCK ONTO THE PROPERTY,

37:45.437 --> 37:48.614
BUT HE NEVER GOT

37:50.703 --> 37:53.793
[clicks]

37:53.880 --> 37:55.055
[gunshot]

37:55.142 --> 37:57.057
WHAT THE HELL?

37:57.144 --> 37:59.102
BUT GORMAN'S KILLED
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE,

37:59.189 --> 38:03.281
SO, MEH, YOU KNOW,
GOOD RIDDANCE.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.674
ESSEX DIDN'T KNOW THAT
GORMAN HAD FAILED.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.546
HE PAID HIM FOR THE HIT.

38:07.633 --> 38:12.638
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY GORMAN
CAME AFTER TRINA.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.596
HE COULDN'T VERY WELL
EXPLAIN TO ESSEX

38:14.683 --> 38:17.164
THAT HE'D CHEATED HIM
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE KILLER.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.605
TRINA, WHY?

38:26.478 --> 38:27.566
UH...

38:27.653 --> 38:30.612
JUSTIN MURDERED HER MOTHER.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.397
I-IT WAS SUICIDE.

38:32.484 --> 38:35.748
JUSTIN GOT THESE
FROM A BAR IN RENO...

38:35.835 --> 38:38.054
WHERE MOLLY DIED.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.100
AND ACCORDING
TO HIS CASE FILE,

38:40.187 --> 38:43.146
HE TOLD POLICE
HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO RENO.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.325
[sniffles]

38:52.982 --> 38:54.462
[Trina] I WAS JUST LOOKING

38:54.549 --> 38:56.377
FOR SOMETHING
TO LIGHT A CANDLE,

38:56.464 --> 38:59.032
AND... WHEN I...

38:59.119 --> 39:00.599
I FOUND THESE.

39:02.731 --> 39:03.993
I-I DON'T GET IT, DAD.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.126
YOU SAID
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.171
[loud smack]AAH! [whimpers]

39:08.258 --> 39:09.216
COME HERE!

39:09.303 --> 39:10.870

39:10.957 --> 39:13.046
GIVE ME THAT!

39:13.133 --> 39:15.483
[drawer closes]

39:15.570 --> 39:18.573
YOUR MOTHER THOUGHT SHE COULD
LEAVE ME AND TAKE YOU WITH HER,

39:18.660 --> 39:20.096
LIKE--LIKE
I'M SOME KIND OF SCHMUCK!

39:20.183 --> 39:21.968
OW! DAD, YOU'RE HURTING ME!
[gasps]

39:22.055 --> 39:24.013
I SWEAR TO GOD,
YOU SAY ONE WORD,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.538
ONE WORD, YOU WILL
END UP THE SAME WAY.[whimpers]

39:26.625 --> 39:28.104
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
DO THAT?

39:28.191 --> 39:31.325
ANSWER ME, GIRL!
ANSWER ME! ANSWER ME!

39:31.412 --> 39:34.154

39:36.548 --> 39:39.551

39:39.638 --> 39:40.856
[thud]

39:42.684 --> 39:43.685
[crying]

39:43.772 --> 39:45.470
OH.

39:45.557 --> 39:46.775
I'M SO SORRY.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.299
[sobbing]

39:49.387 --> 39:52.564
WE NEED TO TALK. NOW.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.479
AHEM.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.490
YOU KNEW.
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME.

40:05.577 --> 40:09.145
UM... NOT THE WHOLE TIME, NO.
HANG ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?[clicks]

40:09.232 --> 40:10.843
I'M CALLING
JUVENILE SERVICES.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.367
DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE HER
TO COUNTY FOR BOOKING.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.935
THAT'S YOUR PLAN
FOR THIS GIRL?GIVE ME THE PHONE!

40:16.022 --> 40:20.505
NO, I CAN'T.SHE TOOK SOMEBODY'S LIFE. SHE
CONFESSED TO A POLICE OFFICER.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.595
FOR GOD SAKES, LISBON,
THE GIRL'S FATHER WAS AN ABUSER.

40:23.682 --> 40:27.033
SO WAS MINE!
I DIDN'T SHOOT HIM!

40:27.120 --> 40:29.165
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

40:29.252 --> 40:30.863
EXACTLY.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.952
AND IF IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE,
SHE'LL BE ACQUITTED.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.736
AND THE COURTS NEVER
GET IT WRONG.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.782
THE SYSTEM NEVER CHEWS
PEOPLE UP.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.828
WE ARETHE SYSTEM. WE GET
IT RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME.

40:39.915 --> 40:41.482
OKAY, SO SHE'S PROVEN INNOCENT.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.224
HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA SPEND IN FOSTER CARE?

40:44.311 --> 40:47.793
SIX MONTHS? A YEAR?

40:47.880 --> 40:49.272
I DON'T KNOW.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.100
IT'S ALL SO UNNECESSARY,
ISN'T IT?

40:51.187 --> 40:53.451
'CAUSE TRINA'S AUNT
IS A NURSE.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.844
AUNT JODIE CAN GET HER
THE PSYCHIATRIC HELP

40:55.931 --> 41:00.022

HELP,NOT PUNISHMENT.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.981
WE DON'T GET TO PICK.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.026
THAT IS
THE JOB OF THE COURTS.PLEASE.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.072
OUR JOB--OUR JOB IS
TO CATCH THE KILLER.

41:06.159 --> 41:08.378
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT IS
UP TO OTHER PEOPLE

41:08.466 --> 41:13.296
WHO ARE ALSO DOING
THE BEST JOB THEY CAN.

41:13.383 --> 41:17.213
DAMN IT. [sighs]
WHY DID SHE CONFESS?

41:17.300 --> 41:19.738
BECAUSE SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.526
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

41:25.613 --> 41:28.616
WE CAN LET HER GO
JUST THIS ONCE.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.010
JUST ONCE.

41:49.811 --> 41:52.597
DON'T BE SCARED.

41:52.684 --> 41:56.252
[police radio chatter,
indistinct conversations]

42:00.996 --> 42:02.781
WHAT DO WE GOT?

42:10.092 --> 42:12.791
IT'S OKAY, TERESA.

42:12.878 --> 42:16.011
HO, WE'RE BUSY HERE, LADY.

42:20.450 --> 42:24.498
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

42:24.585 --> 42:26.108
TRINA, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU HOME.
