WEBVTT

00:02.878 --> 00:04.545
Excuse me?

00:04.754 --> 00:07.546
- I asked if you've...
- We heard you.

00:08.838 --> 00:14.590
What makes you think we're suffering
from a lack of sexual activity?

00:14.840 --> 00:18.675
Starfleet forbids officers from
fraternizing with subordinates.

00:18.884 --> 00:20.967
Unless you've been
violating regulations...

00:21.176 --> 00:24.927
Those regulations don't apply to you.
Have...

00:25.635 --> 00:28.595
...you been suffering?

00:28.845 --> 00:31.638
On Vulcan, we mate only once
every seven years.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.847
That's a hell of a dry spell.

00:35.055 --> 00:38.724
Why are you suddenly
so curious about this?

00:38.974 --> 00:42.517
It's my understanding that your mating
ritual is effective in easing tension.

00:44.183 --> 00:45.934
That hasn't always been
my experience.

00:46.894 --> 00:50.978
And you think that we need
our tensions eased?

00:51.228 --> 00:53.104
Efficiency's down three percent.

00:55.730 --> 00:59.732
We've all gone about ten months
without a break.

00:59.939 --> 01:03.691
I think it's normal for people
to get a little sloppy.

01:04.482 --> 01:07.443
Perhaps it's time the crew
takes shore leave.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.109
Well, I like the sound of that.

01:09.317 --> 01:11.944
I took the liberty of locating
a suitable planet

01:12.194 --> 01:16.654
approximately nine days from our
present location. It's called Risa.

01:16.903 --> 01:18.405
What's your idea of suitable?

01:18.654 --> 01:22.614
It's tropical, with an abundance
of pristine beaches.

01:22.823 --> 01:25.115
You'll find more information
in the Vulcan database.

01:27.824 --> 01:31.242
- Is it populated?
- Yes,

01:31.492 --> 01:35.827
by a humanoid culture
receptive to easing tension.

01:43.247 --> 01:48.581
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:51.041 --> 01:54.458
"It's been a long time"

01:54.667 --> 01:58.502
"But my time is finally near"

01:58.710 --> 02:02.962
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:03.170 --> 02:06.088
"I will touch the sky"

02:06.296 --> 02:10.089
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:10.297 --> 02:13.298
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:13.507 --> 02:18.217
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:18.425 --> 02:21.343
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:21.551 --> 02:26.136
"I've got faith to believe"

02:26.345 --> 02:28.929
"I can do anything"

02:29.137 --> 02:33.639
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:33.847 --> 02:36.723
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:36.932 --> 02:42.267
"I can reach any star"

02:42.642 --> 02:46.393
"I've got faith"

02:46.602 --> 02:50.312
"I've got faith"

02:50.519 --> 02:55.313
"Faith of the heart"

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.487 --> 03:15.862
If you're wearing that to impress
the women on Risa,

03:16.112 --> 03:18.030
you may as well stay onboard.

03:18.238 --> 03:19.447
Rule number one:

03:19.655 --> 03:21.780
You've gotta be seen to get noticed.

03:21.989 --> 03:24.656
And I plan on getting noticed.

03:25.157 --> 03:26.824
Don't say she didn't warn you.

03:27.283 --> 03:31.326
- Figure out your itinerary yet?
- I think I'm gonna pass.

03:31.534 --> 03:34.368
Captain, you need this
as much as I do.

03:34.577 --> 03:36.661
Nobody needs this
as much as you do.

03:37.661 --> 03:41.079
The ship will be nice and quiet.
I've got some astrometric surveys

03:41.288 --> 03:43.039
that have been piling up.

03:43.247 --> 03:44.873
It'll be a good chance
to get work done.

03:45.247 --> 03:49.291
We're going to a planet with over 200
registered Nuvian masseuses,

03:49.499 --> 03:52.167
and you're gonna sit in your cabin
with a bunch of star charts?

03:52.417 --> 03:54.292
Mr Tucker has a point.

03:56.001 --> 03:58.043
You think I need a massage?

03:58.419 --> 04:02.378
The safety of this ship depends on
its captain being at his most efficient.

04:06.838 --> 04:12.257
I suppose I could read those surveys
on a nice beach.

04:12.465 --> 04:15.091
Incoming transmission from
Starfleet Command.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.634
Transfer it to my Ready Room.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.677
Her name's V'Lar.

04:21.885 --> 04:25.011
She's the Vulcan ambassador
to a planet called Mazar.

04:25.262 --> 04:28.346
If you don't mind my asking, admiral,
why is this our problem?

04:28.595 --> 04:31.556
Apparently, it's imperative
that she be taken of that planet

04:31.763 --> 04:33.681
as soon as possible.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.974
The nearest Vulcan ship
is at least a week away.

04:37.641 --> 04:40.851
Do they expect us to take her
all the way back to Vulcan?

04:41.767 --> 04:45.768
You'll rendezvous with the Vulcan ship
Sh'Raan in three days.

04:46.018 --> 04:47.811
They'll take her the rest of the way.

04:48.228 --> 04:49.979
Any idea what the emergency is?

04:51.020 --> 04:53.813
Well, this may come
as a shock to you, Jon,

04:54.021 --> 04:55.689
but the Vulcans aren't talking.

04:56.272 --> 04:57.981
Imagine that.

05:08.068 --> 05:09.944
Thank you for volunteering
your quarters.

05:10.152 --> 05:13.320
I'm happy to do it.
I'm looking forward to meeting her.

05:13.529 --> 05:15.612
I imagine she'll spend
most of the journey alone,

05:15.821 --> 05:19.197
engaged in meditation.
But if it seems appropriate,

05:19.405 --> 05:21.989
- I'll ask if she'll meet with you.
- Thanks.

05:22.198 --> 05:27.408
- If there's anything else I can do...
- If you wouldn't mind taking that.

05:28.700 --> 05:33.035
Ambassador V'Lar is accustomed
to a Spartan environment.

05:44.914 --> 05:47.665
Hoshi, thanks for giving up
your cabin.

05:47.874 --> 05:50.041
I just hope it's Spartan enough, sir.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.335
- Everything set?
- I believe so.

05:57.543 --> 06:01.503
I've prepared this to familiarize
the crew with the necessary protocols.

06:01.712 --> 06:05.296
We should assign a steward
to attend to her needs.

06:05.838 --> 06:09.757
"Don't address the ambassador
unless spoken to first.

06:10.632 --> 06:12.965
Don't offer to shake hands.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.467
Refrain from laughing
in her presence."

06:15.675 --> 06:18.092
Those guidelines
are largely precautionary.

06:18.343 --> 06:21.802
I doubt the crew will have much
opportunity to interact with her.

06:22.343 --> 06:24.720
You seem to be pulling out
all the stops.

06:24.928 --> 06:27.846
I'm simply following the protocols
used in dealing with an ambassador

06:28.054 --> 06:29.638
of V'Lar's distinction.

06:30.764 --> 06:33.431
Well, she'll be here soon enough.

06:33.639 --> 06:37.141
- Let me know if you need any help.
- Thank you, captain.

06:50.104 --> 06:52.146
Entering orbit, sir.

06:52.354 --> 06:53.896
We're being hailed.

06:54.105 --> 06:56.148
It's the Mazarite High Council.

06:57.148 --> 06:59.274
Someone's in a hurry.

07:01.066 --> 07:03.900
- Captain Archer?
- I'm Jonathan Archer.

07:04.109 --> 07:06.276
Are you prepared to receive
Ambassador V'Lar?

07:06.818 --> 07:09.152
That's why we're here.

07:09.652 --> 07:12.070
If you'll transmit your landing
coordinates to us,

07:12.278 --> 07:14.737
we'll send down a shuttlepod.

07:14.946 --> 07:16.904
I'm looking forward to the visit.

07:17.155 --> 07:18.947
I regret there won't be time for that.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.573
The ambassador is already
on her way to your ship.

07:22.073 --> 07:23.699
A small craft's approaching, sir.

07:24.366 --> 07:28.284
I assume the Vulcans have informed
you of the urgency of this matter.

07:28.492 --> 07:30.826
They said it was important that
we pick up the ambassador

07:31.034 --> 07:32.868
as quickly as possible.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.577
They didn't say why.

07:35.703 --> 07:41.622
V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of
her position and criminal misconduct.

07:47.082 --> 07:50.500
- Captain Archer?
- Ambassador.

07:50.708 --> 07:54.417
On behalf of my crew, I'd like to
welcome you aboard Enterprise.

07:54.626 --> 07:56.377
Thank you.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.213
May I take that?

08:05.421 --> 08:08.131
That's very thoughtful, captain.

08:08.339 --> 08:10.590
This is Commander Charles Tucker,
my chief engineer.

08:10.799 --> 08:14.800
- Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine, commander.

08:15.008 --> 08:17.801
And this is my science officer,
Sub-commander T'Pol.

08:22.969 --> 08:27.930
But please, I've been anticipating
the opportunity to practice my English.

08:31.348 --> 08:34.307
I hope you like your quarters,
ambassador.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.933
T'Pol tried very hard
to anticipate your needs.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.851
Fortunately,
my needs are few, captain.

08:42.268 --> 08:46.186
I am curious, though,
who previously occupied the cabin?

08:48.103 --> 08:49.771
The odour.

08:49.979 --> 08:52.730
The human scent is difficult to mask.

08:52.938 --> 08:55.439
Actually, I was hoping
to meet the crew member,

08:55.689 --> 08:59.815
in order to thank her for allowing me
to disrupt her routine.

09:00.024 --> 09:03.692
I prefer not to inconvenience anyone
if possible.

09:03.901 --> 09:07.860
That philosophy has served me well
in the diplomatic service.

09:08.903 --> 09:11.612
T'Pol tells me you negotiated
the first territorial accords

09:11.820 --> 09:14.112
between Vulcan and Andoria.

09:14.362 --> 09:20.865
The Andorians required a somewhat
firmer hand at the negotiating table.

09:21.073 --> 09:23.991
But I was younger then.

09:24.199 --> 09:27.284
That was before we even made
contact with Earth.

09:27.534 --> 09:31.118
That was over 90 years ago.
How long have you been a diplomat?

09:32.952 --> 09:34.619
Commander Tucker,

09:34.828 --> 09:36.495
I understood that on your world,

09:36.704 --> 09:40.246
it is considered bad manners
to ask a lady her age.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.872
Well, I wasn't...

09:42.748 --> 09:45.874
I didn't mean to imply
that you were...

09:46.082 --> 09:48.207
Forgive me, commander.

09:48.416 --> 09:50.375
My attempt at humour.

09:53.209 --> 09:56.669
Suffice it to say that
with T'Pol and myself here,

09:56.878 --> 10:02.254
you're almost certainly dining with
the two oldest people on this ship.

10:07.214 --> 10:08.590
I hope, ambassador,

10:08.798 --> 10:12.341
that you regard the charges
against you with less levity.

10:13.174 --> 10:14.842
Of course I do.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.926
How do you intend
to defend yourself?

10:18.427 --> 10:19.885
There is no defence.

10:22.261 --> 10:24.011
Are you saying you're guilty?

10:24.262 --> 10:27.972
- T'Pol.
- It's all right, captain.

10:29.013 --> 10:33.348
A person in my position carries
the trust of all Vulcans.

10:33.807 --> 10:38.600
The fact that the Mazarites believe
that trust has been compromised

10:38.809 --> 10:42.060
justifies T'Pol's concern.

10:48.937 --> 10:51.272
I'm afraid my age
is betraying me, captain.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.106
Would you mind if I retired?

10:54.690 --> 10:56.399
Of course not.

11:08.277 --> 11:10.403
I've never been to Earth,

11:10.611 --> 11:16.280
but I find the humans I have
encountered quite unpredictable.

11:16.489 --> 11:20.073
I'd be interested in hearing
about your experiences there.

11:20.281 --> 11:22.157
Another time, perhaps.

11:22.366 --> 11:24.532
I understand.

11:24.741 --> 11:28.284
This is your cabin. I'll say good night.

11:28.493 --> 11:30.369
T'Pol.

11:34.953 --> 11:36.746
I sense your anger.

11:37.621 --> 11:39.955
You presume that my time
with humans has left me

11:40.163 --> 11:42.164
susceptible to their emotions.

11:42.414 --> 11:45.373
They're our emotions as well.

11:45.582 --> 11:47.583
We simply hide them better.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.709
If you're sensing anything from me,
it isn't anger.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.378
No.

12:02.046 --> 12:04.047
Disappointment.

12:05.339 --> 12:07.715
Good night, ambassador.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.718
- T'Pol.
- Captain.

12:17.926 --> 12:20.553
Is there a problem
I should be aware of?

12:20.761 --> 12:23.054
I assume you're talking about
Ambassador V'Lar.

12:23.262 --> 12:25.554
You were a bit abrupt with her.

12:26.180 --> 12:29.514
If you believe I was rude,
I'll convey my apologies.

12:30.097 --> 12:34.391
I don't pretend to understand Vulcans.
I never have.

12:34.599 --> 12:36.725
But I wouldn't be a very good captain
if I didn't know

12:36.933 --> 12:39.601
when something was bothering
my science officer.

12:40.476 --> 12:43.895
It's uncommon for a Vulcan
to commit a crime.

12:44.102 --> 12:46.604
Uncommon, but not unheard-of.

12:46.812 --> 12:51.522
Unheard-of for a person
in Ambassador V'Lar's position.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.148
We don't know what she's done.

12:55.773 --> 12:57.566
It doesn't matter.

12:58.232 --> 13:02.650
If she were innocent, she would've
insisted on staying to defend herself.

13:02.859 --> 13:05.444
You seem to know a lot about her.

13:10.778 --> 13:15.405
I've met the ambassador before,
though she clearly doesn't recall.

13:15.613 --> 13:19.657
It was many years ago on Vulcan,
during my early schooling.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.366
She had just negotiated
the Treaty of Ka'Tann,

13:22.575 --> 13:25.158
and I travelled a great distance
to see her.

13:25.409 --> 13:26.742
Was it worth the trip?

13:27.159 --> 13:31.661
The ambassador inspired me
to choose a direction in my own life,

13:31.869 --> 13:35.620
a path that led me to the
Science Council, and eventually here.

13:39.372 --> 13:41.872
I've had a few heroes in my life.

13:42.915 --> 13:45.707
It's never easy when one of them
lets you down.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.834
Vulcans don't have heroes.

13:49.376 --> 13:52.584
No, I'm sure they don't.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.294
Captain, can you come
to the bridge?

13:59.921 --> 14:01.879
On my way.

14:06.173 --> 14:07.966
An unidentified vessel, sir.

14:08.173 --> 14:10.299
Fifty thousand kilometres
and closing.

14:12.925 --> 14:15.884
- They're hailing us.
- Let's find out who they are.

14:18.010 --> 14:20.761
- What can we do for you?
- My apologies, captain.

14:20.969 --> 14:24.721
There's been a change of plans
regarding Ambassador V'Lar.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.055
We weren't told.

14:27.305 --> 14:30.431
We've been having some problems
with our long-range communications.

14:30.890 --> 14:32.307
What's the change of plans?

14:32.516 --> 14:36.642
The magistrate feels that we let
the ambassador go too quickly.

14:36.850 --> 14:38.726
She's needed for
additional questioning.

14:40.893 --> 14:43.269
We don't wanna cause you
any more inconvenience.

14:43.519 --> 14:46.187
If you'll drop out of warp,
we can dock with you

14:46.395 --> 14:48.355
and take the ambassador
aboard our ship.

14:48.604 --> 14:53.397
Your magistrate seemed
in a big hurry to get rid of her.

14:53.606 --> 14:55.023
Now he wants her back?

14:56.482 --> 14:58.149
I'm just a transport captain.

14:58.358 --> 15:02.318
I never try to make sense of what
government bureaucrats are thinking.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.610
I'll have to contact my superiors.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.652
There's really no need.

15:07.402 --> 15:09.528
I'm just a starship captain.

15:09.779 --> 15:13.197
You don't think they'd trust me to make
these kinds of decisions on my own.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.990
We'll wait for you to confirm
whatever you have to.

15:21.116 --> 15:23.241
Get me Starfleet Command.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.618
I can't get through.

15:26.868 --> 15:29.535
That ship's jamming
all our com frequencies.

15:29.744 --> 15:31.953
"Just a transport captain."

15:32.203 --> 15:34.954
- They're charging weapons.
- Polarize the hull plating.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.958
What the hell is he doing? Hail him!

15:48.208 --> 15:49.750
He's not answering.

15:51.585 --> 15:55.878
- Port hull plating's off-line.
- They're closing fast.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.087
Aft torpedoes. Return fire.

16:03.131 --> 16:05.881
No effect. They're using
some kind of energy shielding.

16:07.882 --> 16:12.551
Direct hit to Engineering,
subsection 12. We've taken damage.

16:15.343 --> 16:17.385
Would the phase cannons
be more effective?

16:17.593 --> 16:19.511
Undoubtedly.
But we can't fire them at warp.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.595
- What do you mean?
- Particle discharge, sir.

16:22.804 --> 16:25.930
It would destabilize our warp field
and most likely blow out both nacelles.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.556
I've been working on the problem,
but I haven't quite...

16:30.598 --> 16:32.391
Drop to impulse.

16:32.724 --> 16:34.975
Deploy the aft cannon.

16:40.893 --> 16:43.311
- I've got a lock.
- Fire.

16:48.562 --> 16:49.897
Their shields are failing.

16:50.146 --> 16:52.022
See what you can do
about their engines.

16:55.649 --> 16:57.108
They're dead in the water, sir.

16:59.650 --> 17:00.859
Not dead enough.

17:01.192 --> 17:03.443
- Resume course. Warp 4.
- Aye, sir.

17:05.403 --> 17:07.611
Any idea what that was all about?

17:10.070 --> 17:11.987
Well, I think we know someone
who might.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.531
We were asked to pick you up
and deliver you to a Vulcan ship.

17:18.740 --> 17:21.782
No one said anything
about getting shot at.

17:22.866 --> 17:24.492
You have no idea who they were?

17:24.742 --> 17:27.867
Obviously they weren't sent
by the council on Mazar.

17:28.117 --> 17:30.161
Then who sent them?

17:31.870 --> 17:34.204
I have no answers for you.

17:39.122 --> 17:43.832
Ambassador, we're here at the request
of the Vulcan High Command.

17:44.041 --> 17:47.626
It would be illogical for you
to withhold information from us.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.960
There are diplomatic matters at stake
here which do not concern you.

17:52.336 --> 17:56.504
To tell you any more would only put
your ship and your crew at greater risk.

17:56.754 --> 17:58.421
How much greater could it get?

17:58.630 --> 18:01.297
A few more volleys from that ship
would've ruptured our hull.

18:03.173 --> 18:05.256
I'm sorry, captain.

18:05.506 --> 18:07.215
So am I.

18:10.592 --> 18:12.800
You're leaving me no choice,
ambassador.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.761
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead.

18:15.968 --> 18:19.636
Change of plans, Travis.
Lay in a course back to Mazar.

18:19.887 --> 18:21.471
Sir?

18:21.721 --> 18:24.513
- You heard me.
- Aye, sir.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.806
You're under strict orders
to transport me to the Sh'Raan.

18:29.390 --> 18:31.266
It's more than two days
to the rendezvous point,

18:31.474 --> 18:34.058
and there could be other
hostile ships tracking us.

18:34.267 --> 18:39.435
Unless you can convince me
why it's worth risking all our lives...

18:57.650 --> 18:59.900
The Vulcans are raising
holy hell about this, Jon.

19:00.151 --> 19:02.527
You can always order me
to take her to the rendezvous point.

19:02.735 --> 19:05.986
You're out there, I'm not.
It's your call.

19:06.403 --> 19:08.696
I just want you to know
there'll be repercussions.

19:08.945 --> 19:11.196
They certainly considered
the repercussions.

19:11.405 --> 19:12.780
They knew someone was after her.

19:12.989 --> 19:15.489
Why risk one of your own ships
when you can risk one of ours?

19:15.698 --> 19:17.699
- Jon.
- They're doing it to us again, admiral.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.658
- Keeping us in the dark.
- Have you talked to the ambassador?

19:21.992 --> 19:25.743
- I've tried.
- Maybe she brought this on herself.

19:25.951 --> 19:28.911
You did say that she admitted
the charges against her were true.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.996
I don't even know what
the charges against her are.

19:32.245 --> 19:34.955
Well, I'll talk to Soval,

19:35.205 --> 19:36.997
see what I can find out.

19:37.747 --> 19:41.290
- You really enjoy this, don't you?
- Replacing power couplings? Hardly.

19:41.498 --> 19:43.666
No. I mean, having people
shoot at us.

19:43.874 --> 19:46.750
If you must know,
I much prefer the shooting back part.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.334
I thought this mission was about
peaceful exploration.

19:49.543 --> 19:51.502
I need something to do on this ship,
commander.

19:51.710 --> 19:55.379
Fair enough. I'm just hoping
we don't keep you quite so busy.

19:55.586 --> 19:59.672
I read those Nuvian masseuses
have 12 fingers...

20:00.547 --> 20:02.381
...on each hand.

20:02.589 --> 20:06.799
Then I'd say Starfleet needs to make
its presence known on Risa.

20:17.552 --> 20:21.179
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.055
We were just talking about
my quarters.

20:23.596 --> 20:26.722
I was wondering why they were
so sparsely decorated.

20:27.848 --> 20:30.140
If you need anything,
it can be brought to you.

20:30.390 --> 20:32.558
Oh, I don't want to be waited on.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.559
And since I doubt I'll be travelling
to Earth any time soon,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.894
I decided to spend a little time
with my hosts.

20:39.102 --> 20:40.894
Thank you for the use
of your quarters.

20:41.102 --> 20:43.062
You'll have them back soon enough.

20:45.271 --> 20:47.104
Sub-commander.

20:49.439 --> 20:51.065
Have you tried iced tea?

20:51.689 --> 20:53.107
I don't care for it.

20:53.357 --> 20:57.233
Captain Archer certainly does.
It's flavoured with passion fruit,

20:57.442 --> 21:00.109
an appropriate ingredient for him,
don't you think?

21:00.942 --> 21:03.527
It was the captain that I wanted
to speak to you about.

21:04.028 --> 21:06.361
He's a most intriguing man.

21:06.612 --> 21:08.571
He deserves to be told the truth.

21:11.905 --> 21:13.822
Will you join me?

21:14.698 --> 21:16.115
Please.

21:16.324 --> 21:20.867
We'll be back at Mazar in a few hours.
I'd prefer not to waste that time alone.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.327
This must be awkward for you,

21:26.577 --> 21:28.494
having a foot in two worlds,

21:28.703 --> 21:31.245
loyal to your captain,
yet still a Vulcan.

21:31.996 --> 21:34.038
You can make things easier for him.

21:34.663 --> 21:37.289
The High Command has requested
his assistance.

21:37.539 --> 21:39.832
It doesn't seem unreasonable
to ask why.

21:41.207 --> 21:44.125
You believe Captain Archer
can be trusted?

21:44.375 --> 21:45.459
Yes.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.543
Even though he clearly
doesn't trust us?

21:49.085 --> 21:51.461
He's resentful.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.211
Why?

21:53.628 --> 21:57.754
He believes we held back their
development of warp technology.

21:59.088 --> 22:02.673
We've kept many things from them,
all for good reason.

22:02.923 --> 22:07.174
But situations like this
only reinforce their resentment.

22:07.842 --> 22:11.634
If we expect to continue our relations
with humanity,

22:11.843 --> 22:13.677
we have to earn their trust.

22:14.343 --> 22:17.928
I would not have succeeded
at my career for 94 years

22:18.137 --> 22:20.138
without earning people's trust.

22:20.554 --> 22:22.430
I meant no insult.

22:23.596 --> 22:25.347
Of course not.

22:25.556 --> 22:28.057
You were simply speaking your mind,

22:28.890 --> 22:30.724
as you always have.

22:31.891 --> 22:34.642
It was at Vulcana Regar, wasn't it?

22:34.851 --> 22:36.810
During the second Ka'Tann
conference,

22:37.018 --> 22:39.435
you approached me during a recess.

22:40.936 --> 22:44.938
- You remember.
- You were not easy to forget.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.647
Your questions about
my negotiating tactics

22:47.855 --> 22:50.815
were quite presumptuous
coming from one so young.

22:51.065 --> 22:54.316
I apologize if I acted inappropriately.

22:54.566 --> 22:56.358
Not at all.

22:56.733 --> 23:02.985
In fact, your bluntness made me
reconsider some of my positions.

23:04.319 --> 23:06.695
Much as it has now.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.072
T'Pol,

23:11.280 --> 23:13.031
I have something to tell you.

23:19.824 --> 23:21.492
Come in.

23:25.369 --> 23:27.370
Something wrong?

23:29.578 --> 23:33.330
I took the liberty of speaking
with Ambassador V'Lar.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.705
Go on.

23:36.997 --> 23:38.748
Any luck?

23:39.707 --> 23:43.208
The ambassador and I spent
the last two hours talking.

23:43.666 --> 23:47.918
She's even more remarkable
than her reputation suggests.

23:49.169 --> 23:51.211
I don't doubt that,

23:51.878 --> 23:55.587
- but it doesn't affect my decision.
- I believe it should.

23:55.962 --> 23:58.671
She's not guilty of the crime
she's been accused of.

24:00.380 --> 24:01.632
She told you that?

24:01.839 --> 24:04.382
The charges were fabricated
to get her off Mazar

24:04.591 --> 24:06.633
and divert attention
from her actual mission.

24:06.841 --> 24:09.842
- Which is?
- She can't reveal that.

24:11.301 --> 24:15.136
But she's convinced me that
it's critical we help her accomplish it.

24:17.261 --> 24:19.596
I'm sorry, T'Pol,

24:19.804 --> 24:22.722
but I'm gonna need more than that.

24:23.764 --> 24:27.766
She also told me that
if we return her to Mazar,

24:27.974 --> 24:29.266
she'll be killed.

24:31.641 --> 24:34.268
- By who?
- She wouldn't tell me.

24:34.517 --> 24:36.101
- But you believed her?
- Yes.

24:36.310 --> 24:37.602
Why?

24:39.436 --> 24:44.062
I can't accept that she'd sacrifice
a lifetime of accomplishments

24:44.271 --> 24:47.022
with an act of criminal misconduct.

24:47.689 --> 24:51.065
- It happens all the time.
- Not to her.

24:51.316 --> 24:53.399
We must take her to the Sh'Raan.

24:54.774 --> 24:58.860
You're asking me to put the lives
of everyone onboard in jeopardy

24:59.068 --> 25:03.027
based on your talking to this woman
for a couple of hours.

25:11.030 --> 25:12.281
Captain...

25:14.866 --> 25:19.616
...since I've served aboard Enterprise,
I've never asked you for anything.

25:21.076 --> 25:23.118
I'm asking for this now:

25:23.326 --> 25:26.369
Don't return the ambassador
to Mazar.

25:27.744 --> 25:29.328
Please.

25:37.915 --> 25:39.666
Thank you.

26:02.465 --> 26:05.633
Our Mazarite friends, sir.
And they've brought company.

26:05.841 --> 26:07.300
Why didn't we see them coming?

26:07.509 --> 26:10.426
Our aft sensors are still
out of alignment.

26:10.843 --> 26:12.302
They're targeting our engines.

26:12.551 --> 26:14.678
We could drop to impulse,
use the phase cannons.

26:14.886 --> 26:17.179
And go three against one?

26:18.304 --> 26:20.180
You're familiar with the Mazarites.

26:20.388 --> 26:22.514
- What's their top speed?
- Comparable to Starfleet.

26:22.722 --> 26:25.973
I don't believe
they've exceeded warp 5.

26:26.182 --> 26:28.182
Then let's give them
a run for their money.

26:28.390 --> 26:33.351
- Travis, increase speed to warp 4.8.
- Aye, sir.

26:37.602 --> 26:40.229
Warp 4.8.

26:40.479 --> 26:44.521
They're matching our speed
and accelerating. Warp 4.9.

26:44.772 --> 26:48.773
They're closing to 20,000 kilometres.
Fifteen.

26:50.899 --> 26:52.608
Travis?

26:52.816 --> 26:55.233
Warp 4.9.

27:03.653 --> 27:05.820
They're holding at 4.9, sir.

27:06.071 --> 27:08.238
How far to the rendezvous point?

27:08.447 --> 27:10.947
At this speed, a little over two hours.

27:11.156 --> 27:14.199
But I don't think we can hold it
that long.

27:15.157 --> 27:17.116
Can we get a message
through to the Vulcans?

27:17.325 --> 27:20.242
- The Mazarites are still jamming us.
- Keep trying.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.036
That Vulcan ship better not be late.

27:25.827 --> 27:27.328
Captain?

27:28.621 --> 27:29.954
What's our situation?

27:33.955 --> 27:36.582
We're being chased
by three Mazarite ships.

27:37.749 --> 27:41.167
Will we reach the Sh'Raan before
they can do any more damage?

27:44.792 --> 27:46.585
I'm not sure.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.088
In that case,
I need to speak with you.

28:02.841 --> 28:06.092
I have to consider the possibility
that this mission will fail.

28:06.341 --> 28:09.384
You still haven't told me
what this mission is.

28:09.634 --> 28:12.802
I've been under orders to tell you
only what you need to know.

28:13.052 --> 28:15.970
But that wasn't the only reason
I kept things from you.

28:17.178 --> 28:18.555
I didn't trust you.

28:20.097 --> 28:24.682
As your Mr Tucker pointed out,
I have been around a long time.

28:24.890 --> 28:28.850
I remember when news of your people
first reached Vulcan.

28:29.058 --> 28:32.518
I was fascinated by humanity,

28:32.726 --> 28:34.185
but worried as well.

28:35.018 --> 28:36.227
You hadn't even met us.

28:36.435 --> 28:39.603
You had just emerged
from a global war.

28:39.812 --> 28:41.896
The idea that you
deemed yourselves

28:42.104 --> 28:45.689
ready to join the
interstellar community seemed...

28:45.897 --> 28:47.147
...premature.

28:47.773 --> 28:51.941
And a century of good behaviour
hasn't changed your mind?

29:02.112 --> 29:04.529
The Mazarites pursuing us
are criminals.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.488
They are members
of an organization

29:07.696 --> 29:09.906
that's infiltrated all levels
of government,

29:10.155 --> 29:12.990
making themselves wealthy
and powerful,

29:13.199 --> 29:17.242
at the expense of many
innocent victims.

29:18.909 --> 29:25.161
Their methods include eliminating
anyone who stands in their way.

29:25.703 --> 29:27.246
And that would include you?

29:28.746 --> 29:33.414
Many Mazarites want their government
purged of this corruption.

29:33.622 --> 29:37.999
They asked the Vulcan consulate
to help them expose these criminals.

29:38.248 --> 29:40.917
And that job fell to you?

29:41.458 --> 29:44.918
I have been gathering
evidence against them.

29:45.126 --> 29:47.835
In three months,
I will be called to testify.

29:48.586 --> 29:52.712
It was decided that, until then,
I would be safer on Vulcan.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.630
Why couldn't you tell us?

29:55.338 --> 29:58.756
The investigation was considered
too sensitive.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.840
And the story of you being recalled
in disgrace...

30:02.049 --> 30:07.551
It was hoped that if my reputation
were sullied,

30:07.760 --> 30:10.010
they would not consider me
a credible witness,

30:10.260 --> 30:12.886
and they might not come after me.

30:13.094 --> 30:15.012
Obviously, it didn't work.

30:16.095 --> 30:18.388
The corruption ran deeper
than I thought.

30:21.347 --> 30:23.098
I appreciate...

30:24.390 --> 30:26.183
...you telling me the truth.

30:28.057 --> 30:32.602
I can no longer put you and your crew
in danger, captain.

30:32.809 --> 30:34.643
Please drop out of warp.

30:43.230 --> 30:45.606
It hasn't gotten to that yet.

30:49.898 --> 30:53.025
It's the most logical course of action.

30:54.734 --> 30:57.360
If you've learned anything
about humans, you'd know...

30:58.402 --> 31:02.820
...we don't always take
the most logical course of action.

31:03.028 --> 31:06.321
Captain, report to the bridge.

31:09.656 --> 31:11.615
- They're hailing us.
- What's our status?

31:11.823 --> 31:14.782
Holding at warp 4.9, but
Commander Tucker doesn't believe

31:14.991 --> 31:18.117
we can sustain it for more
than another ten minutes.

31:18.325 --> 31:20.118
I don't believe they can either, sir.

31:20.368 --> 31:24.286
They're releasing drive plasma to keep
their warp coils from overloading.

31:24.744 --> 31:26.453
Open a channel.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.163
Captain. Ambassador.

31:31.372 --> 31:34.289
- What do you want?
- Just giving you a friendly warning.

31:34.498 --> 31:37.040
Are you aware that your engines
are overheating?

31:37.457 --> 31:38.833
So are yours.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.668
We have no quarrel with you.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.709
Give us the Vulcan
and you'll be free to go.

31:46.001 --> 31:48.211
I have a better idea.

31:49.045 --> 31:51.629
Why don't you slow down
before your engines explode.

31:54.839 --> 31:58.506
Why would you risk the lives
of your crew for this criminal?

31:59.006 --> 32:02.883
I've been ordered to deliver her safely
to the Vulcans.

32:03.091 --> 32:05.676
And that's exactly what I plan to do.

32:10.636 --> 32:12.427
They're increasing speed.

32:12.636 --> 32:14.387
Warp 4.95.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.304
They're re-entering
weapons range, sir.

32:19.055 --> 32:20.263
Archer to Engineering.

32:20.514 --> 32:22.765
Please tell me you're ready
to slow down.

32:22.973 --> 32:25.224
Sorry, Trip, but we need
a little more speed.

32:25.432 --> 32:27.183
I don't know how much more
I can give you.

32:27.642 --> 32:30.935
- It's called a Warp 5 engine.
- On paper.

32:33.268 --> 32:35.102
We don't have any choice, Trip.

32:36.770 --> 32:37.937
Aye, sir.

32:40.188 --> 32:41.855
Ambassador.

32:51.108 --> 32:52.817
Warp 5.

32:56.693 --> 32:58.444
Four-point-nine-three.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.528
Nine-five.

33:07.822 --> 33:09.782
Don't take your eyes off
that antimatter stream.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.532
Yes, sir.

33:20.744 --> 33:22.453
Four-point-nine-seven.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.954
They're matching our speed.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.623
Four-point-nine-nine.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.416
Warp 5.

33:48.003 --> 33:49.503
They're still gaining on us.

34:00.465 --> 34:02.842
How far to the Vulcan ship?

34:03.049 --> 34:06.301
Their jamming signal is disrupting
our sensors as well.

34:06.509 --> 34:09.844
Then use their last known position
and do the math.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.304
Take a guess.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.804
If we could maintain
our present speed,

34:16.013 --> 34:17.972
approximately 53 minutes.

34:18.179 --> 34:21.348
The Mazarites will be in
firing range long before then.

34:22.348 --> 34:25.558
What if we could get
a message through?

34:25.766 --> 34:28.058
Tell them to get here
as fast as they can.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.685
The Sh'Raan is capable of warp 7.

34:30.893 --> 34:33.893
If we could maintain warp 5,

34:34.103 --> 34:36.186
we'd reach them in 12 minutes.

34:36.812 --> 34:38.228
Hoshi.

34:38.437 --> 34:40.728
Any way you can get a message
through the interference?

34:40.938 --> 34:42.897
I don't see how, sir.

34:44.022 --> 34:46.482
There's a diplomatic frequency
we sometimes use.

34:46.690 --> 34:50.858
It's in a lower subspace band.
I doubt the Mazarites are aware of it.

34:51.067 --> 34:54.567
It's been a few years
since I did this.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.777
If we do get a message through
to the Vulcans,

34:57.985 --> 35:00.612
we don't want the Mazarites
to see them coming.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.071
We could try deflecting
their jamming signal, sir.

35:03.279 --> 35:05.988
Use it to blind their sensors as well.

35:06.197 --> 35:07.906
- See what you can do.
- Aye, sir.

35:10.698 --> 35:12.533
Hoshi?

35:12.741 --> 35:16.659
We may have gotten a message
through to them, sir, but I'm not sure.

35:16.867 --> 35:19.202
Wouldn't they respond?

35:27.412 --> 35:28.622
Tucker to the bridge!

35:29.038 --> 35:31.164
- Go ahead.
- The port injectors just blew!

35:31.414 --> 35:34.749
- We've gotta slow down, captain!
- I got it! I got it!

35:35.749 --> 35:38.333
- Hoshi?
- The com just went down, sir.

35:38.583 --> 35:40.250
They're right on top of us.

35:40.584 --> 35:43.335
- How long?
- Eight minutes.

35:51.588 --> 35:53.506
That's a direct hit
to our starboard nacelle.

35:53.713 --> 35:55.881
We're dropping to impulse.

36:06.217 --> 36:07.927
They're hailing us.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.220
How long now?

36:13.846 --> 36:15.929
If they received our message,

36:16.138 --> 36:18.556
- another ten minutes.
- I thought it was down to eight.

36:18.764 --> 36:20.848
That was before we dropped out
of warp.

36:21.057 --> 36:23.224
We can't hold off their ships
for that long.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.392
You've done your best, captain,
and I thank you for it.

36:28.225 --> 36:31.768
But it's time for me
to turn myself over to them.

36:32.394 --> 36:34.978
We just need to buy
ten more minutes.

36:35.187 --> 36:37.854
- Captain...
- I want you to go to Sickbay.

36:39.104 --> 36:41.480
- Sickbay?
- I'll explain later.

36:41.689 --> 36:46.274
If there was ever a time
to start trusting us, this would be it.

36:59.653 --> 37:00.862
Put him through.

37:02.071 --> 37:03.530
Give us the Vulcan.

37:03.739 --> 37:08.365
You know, I honestly didn't think
you'd be able to catch us.

37:09.157 --> 37:11.241
Just out of curiosity,

37:11.450 --> 37:12.950
how fast do your ships go?

37:13.199 --> 37:16.576
Put her on a shuttle
and bring her to our lead vessel.

37:17.285 --> 37:18.577
That could be a problem.

37:18.952 --> 37:21.035
Our shuttlebay was damaged,
thanks to you.

37:21.244 --> 37:24.203
I doubt we could launch a shuttlepod
until it's repaired.

37:24.412 --> 37:25.912
What...?

37:27.204 --> 37:30.081
What would you have topped out at?
Warp 5.5?

37:30.539 --> 37:33.540
Warp 6? I can't imagine you could do
much more than that.

37:33.748 --> 37:35.916
Your engines were starting
to run pretty hot.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.291
Prepare to be boarded.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.001
Malcolm, I'm counting on you.

37:42.585 --> 37:44.169
T'Pol.

37:56.215 --> 37:57.632
Okay.

38:01.716 --> 38:03.467
Where is she?

38:03.968 --> 38:07.302
Your last attack blew out systems
across half the ship.

38:07.511 --> 38:11.512
Power's down in Engineering,
a plasma conduit exploded on E Deck.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.429
I didn't ask for a damage report.
Where is she?

38:15.638 --> 38:17.514
I was getting to that.

38:17.722 --> 38:20.306
Her quarters are on E Deck.

38:20.515 --> 38:24.058
She was no more than ten metres
away when the conduit blew.

38:24.266 --> 38:26.059
Her injuries are extensive.

38:26.267 --> 38:29.976
Plasma burns, neurological trauma.

38:31.602 --> 38:33.311
I wanna see her.

38:38.522 --> 38:40.688
This is Dr Phlox.

38:42.105 --> 38:46.066
- The Vulcan?
- Undergoing dermal regeneration.

38:47.483 --> 38:49.025
Open it.

38:49.651 --> 38:51.068
I will not.

38:51.734 --> 38:54.401
I don't know what business you have,
but when she was brought in,

38:54.610 --> 38:55.736
she became my patient.

38:55.943 --> 38:58.695
If I remove her from the imaging
chamber prematurely, she'll die.

39:04.906 --> 39:06.281
Open it.

39:10.324 --> 39:13.533
- Yes?
- Our sensors just went down, captain.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.784
- What's causing it?
- Enterprise is redirecting

39:16.035 --> 39:17.410
our jamming signal.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.455
No!

39:58.799 --> 40:00.425
Report!

40:01.550 --> 40:04.051
Answer me! What's going on?

40:04.676 --> 40:06.760
I imagine they have
their hands full right now.

40:11.053 --> 40:13.513
I believe that's the Sh'Raan.

40:14.305 --> 40:16.972
She's a Vulcan combat cruiser.
One of their most powerful,

40:17.222 --> 40:19.015
if I'm not mistaken.

40:19.557 --> 40:23.016
Sir, the captain of the Sh'Raan
wants to speak to you.

40:29.185 --> 40:30.811
Put it up.

40:31.727 --> 40:35.354
Captain Archer,
are you in any danger?

40:37.771 --> 40:39.063
You could say that.

40:39.272 --> 40:41.981
Tell the Mazarites to turn
their weapons over immediately,

40:42.189 --> 40:45.357
or we'll destroy their ships.

40:54.860 --> 40:57.362
We'll be standing by, captain.

40:57.569 --> 40:59.153
Thank you.

41:02.530 --> 41:04.781
We did what we came to do.

41:05.073 --> 41:06.989
That's all that matters.

41:09.825 --> 41:12.575
I am sorry to disappoint you.

41:16.201 --> 41:20.994
I look forward to adding this incident
to my testimony at your trial.

41:39.293 --> 41:43.711
Captain's starlog,
February 9th, 2152.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.254
The Vulcans have allowed
the Mazarites to leave.

41:47.462 --> 41:50.880
Ambassador V'Lar says there's
a good reason for doing so,

41:51.088 --> 41:54.465
though she's certainly not
sharing it with me.

42:01.092 --> 42:05.385
Someday I'd like to walk into a room
without it seeming like a state visit.

42:05.594 --> 42:06.928
Occupational hazard?

42:09.054 --> 42:11.304
I'll be along in a moment.

42:13.639 --> 42:14.972
Thank you, captain.

42:16.014 --> 42:19.057
I'm sorry for the trouble
I've caused you and your crew.

42:19.766 --> 42:21.391
We're glad we could help.

42:24.184 --> 42:27.435
I sense a great bond between you,

42:27.643 --> 42:31.352
a bond of trust and respect.

42:31.561 --> 42:33.437
But also...

42:34.145 --> 42:36.563
...a bond of friendship.

42:38.564 --> 42:43.190
I think it bodes well for the future
relations of our two peoples.

42:49.692 --> 42:50.943
Goodbye, ambassador.

42:58.195 --> 43:01.280
Live long... and prosper.
