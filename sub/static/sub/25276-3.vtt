What's poppin', people?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:05.219 --> 00:07.203
You know what I learned
at a really young age?

00:07.204 --> 00:09.305
Never disappoint a sister,

00:09.306 --> 00:12.408
especially when that sister
is your sister.

00:12.409 --> 00:14.800
For example, when my sisters found out

00:14.801 --> 00:17.536
you can no longer stream
"Hanging with Mr. Cooper,"

00:17.537 --> 00:19.771
lord, mm...

00:19.772 --> 00:21.539
<i>- Why!
- Everything they do!</i>

00:21.540 --> 00:23.074
- Who we gonna hang with now?
<i>- Everything they do!</i>

00:23.075 --> 00:24.642
<i>- Lord, this is a crime.
- Huh?</i>

00:24.643 --> 00:26.711
<i>Mark Curry ain't never hurt nobody.</i>

00:26.712 --> 00:28.980
Girl, you can get 'em on YouTube.

00:28.981 --> 00:31.582
<i>Oh. What's your password?</i>

00:31.583 --> 00:32.950
Get a damn job.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.719
<i>Is that all caps?</i>

00:47.565 --> 00:50.267
I can't believe
we went all over town to get

00:50.268 --> 00:52.002
snacks for Marlon's sisters.

00:52.003 --> 00:55.138
How's Whole Foods gonna have
ten types of flaxseed

00:55.139 --> 00:57.207
but no Flamin' Hots?

00:57.208 --> 00:59.609
[sighs] You cursed them out
in your comment card.

00:59.610 --> 01:02.212
I think they got the message.

01:02.213 --> 01:04.881
And why aren't they staying
at Marlon's house anyway?

01:04.882 --> 01:06.716
Because his place is too small.

01:06.717 --> 01:09.486
Plus, divorced or not, I still
consider them my sisters.

01:09.487 --> 01:10.720
Oh, well, don't get me wrong.

01:10.721 --> 01:12.972
Lenora and Lovie are my girls.

01:12.973 --> 01:17.310
It's their big-head brother
I can't stand.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.411
Mm.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.879
Why are you making it smell

01:19.880 --> 01:23.815
like a men's dorm room
at a black college?

01:23.816 --> 01:28.387
'Cause I want you
to feel right at home.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.855
That's Cool Water cologne.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.890
His sisters buy it for him
every Christmas.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.859
Yes, and I want them
to think I'm wearing it,

01:33.860 --> 01:35.527
even though I'm not wearing it.

01:35.528 --> 01:39.097
Kind of like you do
with your IUD in Richmond.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.266
- Uh, Marlon?
- Yeah?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.535
Is that our wedding photo?

01:43.536 --> 01:46.104
Oh, would you look at that?
I think Zack put that there.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.939
He must have found it in the garage.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.575
He's a nostalgic little bastard.

01:50.576 --> 01:53.011
But, Dad, you're the one
who told me to grab the...

01:53.012 --> 01:55.647
Boy, if you don't
get your behind upstairs.

01:55.648 --> 01:59.551
I'ma make you stop wearing
your sister's hand-me-downs.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.019
Uh, so, Ash, uh,

02:01.020 --> 02:03.261
you know, I was thinking about
this weekend.

02:03.262 --> 02:05.230
You know, maybe I'll crash here,

02:05.231 --> 02:06.465
you know, avoid traffic,

02:06.466 --> 02:09.901
maximize the time with my sisters.

02:09.901 --> 02:12.838
Okay. Hold up.

02:12.839 --> 02:15.307
The wedding photo, the funky cologne,

02:15.308 --> 02:17.743
and now you want to crash here?

02:17.744 --> 02:19.936
Marlon, you still haven't
told your sisters

02:19.937 --> 02:21.326
about our divorce, have you?

02:21.327 --> 02:23.497
What? Wh... really?

02:23.498 --> 02:25.633
Oh, wow! Really?

02:25.634 --> 02:26.684
Oh, really?

02:26.685 --> 02:27.701
Like I was just gonna

02:27.702 --> 02:28.990
move back in here,

02:28.991 --> 02:30.448
pretend we're still married,

02:30.449 --> 02:31.431
and hope you don't notice?

02:31.432 --> 02:32.483
Yeah...

02:32.484 --> 02:36.144
Where should I put your stuff?

02:36.145 --> 02:37.806
Ashley's closet.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.773
So what was you talking about?

02:39.774 --> 02:42.656
You know what?
Of course you haven't told them.

02:42.657 --> 02:45.538
Marlon, you've spent your entire life

02:45.539 --> 02:46.860
bending over backwards

02:46.861 --> 02:48.658
trying not to disappoint your sisters.

02:48.659 --> 02:50.048
Ashley, if I could
bend over backwards,

02:50.049 --> 02:53.303
girl, I wouldn't leave my room.

02:53.304 --> 02:55.507
Marlon, it's true!

02:55.508 --> 02:57.440
I had to postpone my C-section,

02:57.441 --> 03:01.137
because Lovie wanted Marley
to share the same birthday

03:01.138 --> 03:03.374
as Keith Sweat.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.663
It could have been worse.

03:04.664 --> 03:05.985
It could have been Bobby Brown's.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.461
Okay, y'all need to wrap this up.

03:08.462 --> 03:09.953
I do not want Miss Lenora

03:09.954 --> 03:11.614
picking up all this negative energy

03:11.615 --> 03:13.073
when I'm getting my psychic reading.

03:13.074 --> 03:15.412
She's gonna tell me
what my next step is.

03:15.413 --> 03:17.989
Hopefully it's to the mall,
so you can get a new outfit.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.549
This is cute.
I don't care what you say.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.143
Oh, look at your old ass
trying to look young,

03:21.144 --> 03:22.804
look like you shop at Forever 41.

03:22.805 --> 03:24.398
- Go on.
- No! That's...

03:24.399 --> 03:25.551
Okay! Stop!

03:25.552 --> 03:26.737
- One more time!
- Ignore him!

03:26.738 --> 03:28.297
- One more time.
- Ignore him.

03:28.298 --> 03:30.807
Ashley, look, my sisters
pretty much raised me,

03:30.808 --> 03:32.503
and you've never seen them upset.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.164
Like, they get mad mad.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.131
It's kind of like telling the Beyhive

03:36.132 --> 03:38.708
that Beyonce's "Lemonade"
was just a'ight.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.132

03:40.133 --> 03:42.539
Blasphemy.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.167
Exactly.

03:44.168 --> 03:45.268
Come on, Ash.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.202
My sisters' favorite thing
about me is you.

03:48.203 --> 03:50.305
And if they find out that
me and you aren't together,

03:50.306 --> 03:53.153
they gonna flip they wigs
and they weaves.

03:53.154 --> 03:55.967
Marlon, we cannot spend
the rest of our lives

03:55.968 --> 03:57.833
pretending we're happily married.

03:57.834 --> 04:01.800
Why not? My parents did it.

04:01.801 --> 04:03.258
Come on, Ashley. Listen.

04:03.259 --> 04:05.056
Just do this for me
for two days, okay?

04:05.057 --> 04:06.683
Until they go back to New York.

04:06.684 --> 04:08.040
And then when they leave,
I'll call them

04:08.041 --> 04:10.006
and I'll tell them, over the phone,

04:10.007 --> 04:14.042
'cause you can't dropkick
a brother over the phone.

04:14.043 --> 04:16.992
Marlon, we cannot
do this to our children.

04:16.993 --> 04:18.314
Oh, girl, what you talking about?

04:18.315 --> 04:19.535
Kids.

04:19.536 --> 04:20.925
When your aunties get here,

04:20.926 --> 04:22.587
me and your mama
gonna pretend we're married

04:22.588 --> 04:24.588
And when they leave,
I'ma give you $20.

04:24.589 --> 04:27.911
I love money.

04:27.912 --> 04:29.335
See, Ash? They cool with it.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.725
You the only one tripping.

04:30.726 --> 04:33.540
I cannot do this, Marlon. I'm sorry.

18:50.897 --> 18:55.202
It's too damn wet.

18:55.203 --> 18:58.727
[both breathing shakily]

19:03.681 --> 19:05.205
She be a'ight.

19:05.206 --> 19:08.664
I don't really care

19:08.665 --> 19:11.038
if you look like Questlove down there

19:11.039 --> 19:13.276
and that ball done dropped.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.598
I'ma bust your ass!

19:14.599 --> 19:16.394
Wait... what... no! Stop!

19:20.545 --> 19:22.714
<i>♪</i>

19:22.715 --> 19:23.641
♪
<i>- Well, you know what?</i>

19:23.642 --> 19:25.641
Maybe pretending
we were happily married

19:25.642 --> 19:27.743
for the rest of our lives
would have been easier.

19:27.744 --> 19:28.930
No.

19:28.931 --> 19:30.490
I should have been
real with them before

19:30.491 --> 19:31.711
our marriage even started.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.390
- Hey.
- Hm?

19:34.391 --> 19:36.085
I'm sorry I put you through that.

19:36.086 --> 19:38.900
Marlon, you don't
have to apologize to me.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.002
Okay? You fought for me.

19:41.003 --> 19:45.410
It was a woman. And you lost.

19:45.411 --> 19:47.105
But you fought for me.

19:47.106 --> 19:50.157
Besides, you know
I'm your ride or die.

19:50.158 --> 19:52.054
Always.

19:54.769 --> 19:57.991
[screams] If you hit me,
I'm gonna tell Mommy.

19:57.992 --> 20:00.806
Oh, Marlon, we just want to talk.

20:00.807 --> 20:03.417
It hurts us to see
both of you divorced.

20:03.418 --> 20:04.863
But what hurts more is that

20:04.864 --> 20:07.677
you couldn't come to your
sisters and talk about it.

20:07.678 --> 20:08.933
Well...

20:08.934 --> 20:10.560
I know how much you guys love Ashley.

20:10.561 --> 20:13.849
And I... I... I just
didn't want to disappoint you.

20:13.850 --> 20:15.477
And I'm sorry.

20:15.478 --> 20:18.631
Boy, you stupider than I thought.

20:18.632 --> 20:19.953
Come on.

20:19.954 --> 20:21.615
You marrying Ashley?

20:21.616 --> 20:24.192
That's only one of the things
we're proud of.

20:24.193 --> 20:27.074
Yeah. You got your 401K.

20:27.075 --> 20:29.142
And those babies?

20:29.143 --> 20:31.584
They don't even curse.

20:31.585 --> 20:33.720
Yeah, well that's all Ashley.

20:33.721 --> 20:37.755
I been trying to get the boy to
say disgusting things for years.

20:37.756 --> 20:41.655
Marlon, you're the most
generous person I know.

20:41.656 --> 20:43.486
I wouldn't be able to stream my shows

20:43.487 --> 20:47.047
if you didn't share your password.

20:47.048 --> 20:50.132
Marlon, you got a good heart.

20:50.133 --> 20:53.455
You pretended to still be married,

20:53.456 --> 20:59.143
making a mockery of God's
most holiest institution,

20:59.144 --> 21:02.011
- just to not disappoint us.
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.597
You going to Hell just for us.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.190
Yeah, you are.

21:06.191 --> 21:07.649
Aww, damn.

21:07.650 --> 21:10.294
- I love my sisters.
- Both: Aww.

21:10.295 --> 21:12.397
Ashley, get your ass over here.

21:12.398 --> 21:14.906
Yeah, get your little
skinny behind over here, girl.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.212
You know you still our little sister.

21:17.213 --> 21:19.856
Oh, we're always
gonna be proud of you.

21:19.857 --> 21:21.315
And when you step out of line,

21:21.316 --> 21:23.756
we're always gonna kick that ass.

21:23.757 --> 21:25.282
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

21:25.283 --> 21:27.588
Like we about to do
in this spades game!

21:27.589 --> 21:28.944
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Oh, wait a minute!

21:28.945 --> 21:30.029
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

21:30.030 --> 21:31.691
Oh, no, y'all didn't!

21:31.692 --> 21:33.013
- Yes.
- Come on.

21:33.014 --> 21:34.302
- Oh, we about to do it.
- You don't know.
