01:04.580 --> 01:08.331
So, we've been professionally
trained wedding videographers

01:08.333 --> 01:10.126
for, you know,
a good while now.

01:10.128 --> 01:13.170
- I'd say a year. About a year now?
- Yeah.

01:13.172 --> 01:16.548
And it hasn't been fun or easy
because it's not supposed to.

01:16.550 --> 01:19.926
It's just been...
it's been tough.

01:19.928 --> 01:22.304
Because, you know,
out of all of the videography

01:22.306 --> 01:26.683
that you can do, and learn,
and go to school for, and become great at,

01:26.685 --> 01:29.102
I'd say wedding videography
is probably the toughest

01:29.104 --> 01:31.438
to really... really break into,
you know.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.149
- Yeah, no doubt, no doubt.
- Yeah.

01:33.151 --> 01:37.778
So, obviously, for us,
the training, it's everything.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.406
Training is very important.

01:40.408 --> 01:44.826
I mean, there are
no second takes at a wedding.

01:44.828 --> 01:46.370
The training is key.

01:46.372 --> 01:50.290
It's the only way we can
capture every single moment,

01:50.292 --> 01:52.709
and make sure it's great.

01:52.711 --> 01:55.045
Flynn!
Flynn, drunk uncle.

01:55.047 --> 01:57.256
Move through it!
Move through it, Flynn! Come on!

01:57.258 --> 01:58.507
Come on, drunk uncle!

01:58.509 --> 02:00.091
- Stop. Watch out for him.
- I can't see.

02:00.093 --> 02:02.677
- Watch out. Get the shot in the face.
- I got the shot.

02:02.679 --> 02:04.846
Watch, 'cause he's coming
at you quick, man.

02:04.848 --> 02:08.309
Watch out for him!
See, he's got Vietnam stuff, man!

02:08.311 --> 02:11.729
Yesterday, just like yesterday.
Watch your wires. Come on, Flynn.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.481
- So, what are you gonna do?
- It's still under control, Augie.

02:14.483 --> 02:18.069
Yeah, we... how would you tie
that around your arm, Flynn?

02:18.071 --> 02:21.404
- How did you tie the wire around your arm?
- I don't know, I just draped it.

02:21.406 --> 02:23.116
- You're gonna drape wires?
- Yeah.

02:23.118 --> 02:24.659
At a wedding,
with a bunch of kids?

02:24.661 --> 02:26.452
Everyone's walking around.

02:26.454 --> 02:29.664
A little girl's gonna trip on that
wire, and you're gonna hurt her?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.332
You're gonna bust her nose open.

02:31.334 --> 02:34.000
You're gonna break a little
girl's nose at a wedding?

02:34.002 --> 02:35.628
Flynn, what is wrong with you?

02:35.630 --> 02:38.880
- Go back. Do a reset back into it.
- Reset, position one.

02:38.882 --> 02:41.801
Get your head in it, man.
Where are you today?

02:41.803 --> 02:45.137
Through the dinner crowd. Come on, we got a dinner crowd.

02:45.139 --> 02:47.432
Everyone's up.
Ravioli, ravioli, ravioli.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.142
Come on, lose me.
Everyone's eating.

02:49.144 --> 02:51.226
Come on, double-time...
six seconds, six seconds.

02:51.228 --> 02:52.936
Watch out, watch out
All right, all right.

02:52.938 --> 02:54.689
Watch out!
Old ladies, old ladies.

02:54.691 --> 02:56.731
- Behind you!
- Oh! There it is! Oh!

02:56.733 --> 02:59.235
Going back through the people,
going in reverse!

02:59.237 --> 03:01.237
Watch out, everybody!
Throw it in reverse.

03:01.239 --> 03:03.822
Getting grandma.
Oh! Oh!

03:03.824 --> 03:05.700
- Turns off.
- Two stories!

03:05.702 --> 03:08.743
- Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!

03:08.745 --> 03:10.662
- Now that's good right there. Twenty-six.
- Whoo!

03:10.664 --> 03:12.331
I like that, man.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.958
That's how you do it,
just keep your head in the game.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.710
Yeah, that's the thing.

03:16.712 --> 03:20.922
We usually get paid with what
we like to call "vendor food."

03:20.924 --> 03:24.510
It's usually the food they
have on set for the workers.

03:24.512 --> 03:28.513
And, you know, usually we just get
the scraps, like the leftover stuff,

03:28.515 --> 03:32.476
and, actually, August has been
accumulating a lot of this food

03:32.478 --> 03:33.852
for quite some time.

03:33.854 --> 03:35.688
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.773
- It keeps our bellies full, you know?
- Yeah.

03:37.775 --> 03:39.691
I mean,
with a lot of these places,

03:39.693 --> 03:43.279
we're talking an endless supply
of leftover vendor food,

03:43.281 --> 03:48.034
like rigatoni, and meatballs,
and pasta sauce,

03:48.036 --> 03:53.164
and rigatoni, and spaghetti
sometimes, a lot of bread.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.374
There's rigatoni,
rigatoni and sauce,

03:56.376 --> 04:02.297
rigatoni, rigatoni,
sometimes there's lasagna,

04:02.299 --> 04:05.301
rigatoni, fish,
once there was fish.

04:05.303 --> 04:08.303
Rigatoni, we got rigatoni.

04:08.305 --> 04:11.392
We got...

04:12.519 --> 04:15.102
It's pretty good,
so we'll just save it for later.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.312
Did you tell them
about the rigatoni?

04:17.314 --> 04:19.439
And for desserts,
it's usually cake.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.940
You know, we have
a lot of cake...

04:20.942 --> 04:25.862
white, marble, chocolate,
marble, white,

04:25.864 --> 04:31.660
marble, white, white,
white, white, white...

04:31.662 --> 04:34.330
Again, August, this is
like the rigatoni thing.

04:34.332 --> 04:38.835
You can just say, you know,
we have white, we have marble.

04:38.837 --> 04:40.920
I know you have it memorized
in your head,

04:40.922 --> 04:44.506
but you don't have to list out
every piece of cake we have.

04:44.508 --> 04:45.715
Oh.

04:45.717 --> 04:47.509
This is our little door here.

04:47.511 --> 04:49.679
It kind of divides the rooms up,

04:49.681 --> 04:52.723
give us a little bit of privacy,
you know?

04:52.725 --> 04:56.727
And this is August's bed.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.437
He's got the big bed.

04:58.439 --> 05:00.439
He likes sleeping
in the hammock.

05:00.441 --> 05:02.775
A little fun fact about me:

05:02.777 --> 05:05.944
I... I like to sleep sitting up.

05:05.946 --> 05:08.155
I've always done it
since I was a kid.

05:08.157 --> 05:11.992
And just not a real big fan
of beds.

05:11.994 --> 05:13.953
And...

05:13.955 --> 05:17.625
we go by a two-bucket system
here, okay?

05:18.626 --> 05:21.710
We make sure we got one for our
bathroom, one for washing.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.172
And it's easy to be able
to tell them to apart.

05:24.174 --> 05:26.215
And it's always good...
we go down to the creek,

05:26.217 --> 05:30.386
and we're able to get our leftover
waters and take care of it, and...

05:30.388 --> 05:32.929
Oh, wait, I think the rag
was in the...

05:32.931 --> 05:34.973
Yeah, the rag
was in the right... This is the...

05:34.975 --> 05:37.727
Yeah, this is the bath... aw.

05:37.729 --> 05:39.061
Oh, wait.

05:39.063 --> 05:41.730
You know, it's a garage.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.107
And I'm sure a lot of people
are like, "Oh my God,

05:44.109 --> 05:46.151
you're living in a garage,"
but...

05:46.153 --> 05:49.696
Our subletter/owner,
Doris, she lives upstairs,

05:49.698 --> 05:52.701
so some of her stuff
is still down here.

05:54.369 --> 05:58.206
Like, what the fuck?

05:58.208 --> 06:01.374
So, what do you
think of the Bergeron Brothers?

06:01.376 --> 06:04.295
The Bergeron Brothers?

06:04.297 --> 06:07.131
I get 50 bucks from them
a month.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.800
I think a lot of other things.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.552
But I'm not gonna talk
about them.

06:11.554 --> 06:14.222
You're following us all around.
You'll see.

06:14.224 --> 06:16.682
- The bride! Work on the bride!
- You'll s...

06:16.684 --> 06:19.104
Ow! The bride!

06:20.563 --> 06:22.021
See?

06:27.112 --> 06:28.985
All right. All right.

06:28.987 --> 06:30.655
Get through the cones.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.657
Here we go.
Ring bearer down!

06:32.659 --> 06:34.617
- Ah! Ah!
- Hey, August!

06:34.619 --> 06:36.869
- My nuts! Oh, my nuts!
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

06:36.871 --> 06:38.287
You're gonna pop
the ring bearer.

06:38.289 --> 06:40.331
Get off it.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.667
- I'm okay. I got the shots.
- You popped this.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.460
Oh, I got the shots.

06:45.462 --> 06:51.008
- Hey, what'd you do?
- Aw, my scrotum.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.884
Hit your giggles.

06:52.886 --> 06:55.972
Right here, right here.

06:55.974 --> 06:57.889
- Thanks, bro.
- Come on.

06:57.891 --> 07:00.269
- Come on. Jesus.
- Thank you.

07:00.979 --> 07:04.187
I think one... one of your guys
has been spitting.

07:04.189 --> 07:05.857
One of your guys has been
spitting on the ground.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.775
- No one's spitting.
- They're spinning on the ground.

07:07.777 --> 07:09.401
- I stepped on some spit.
- Don't be offensive.

07:09.403 --> 07:11.237
You can't spit
on people's property.

07:11.239 --> 07:13.780
- You're being offensive.
- Don't spit on property.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.699
These guys are spitting
in Doris' yard.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.285
- You're being offensive.
- They're spitting on Doris' yard.

07:18.287 --> 07:20.203
You have to learn
how to use tact, okay?

07:20.205 --> 07:22.331
- Don't tell me to talk to people.
- We have guests here.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.917
- They're doing us a favor.
- Don't embarrass me in front of these people.

07:24.919 --> 07:27.044
- Don't talk to me. I'm telling these people.
- Don't embarrass me.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.047
These people are going... they're saying
every time that I have to film a wedding,

07:30.049 --> 07:32.508
they're gonna come out here
and tell me what to do.

07:32.510 --> 07:36.595
- What...
- August, don't. Don't!

07:36.597 --> 07:39.973
Come on, you're ruining the trees.

07:39.975 --> 07:42.518
This guy.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.980
I mean, it's like you push him
a little bit, okay,

07:45.982 --> 07:47.773
and he just breaks.

07:47.775 --> 07:50.943
And I... he's gotta get
used to it.

07:50.945 --> 07:53.278
I gotta break him for real.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.698
So, the decision to become
wedding videographers,

07:55.700 --> 08:00.828
it came up actually right after
Flynn's wedding, right?

08:00.830 --> 08:03.915
Well, you know, I always
kind of had it in my head,

08:03.917 --> 08:07.585
- but it was right around there.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.129
So, here I am barely making
eight bucks an hour,

08:10.131 --> 08:12.715
some dive bar restaurant
down the road, okay?

08:12.717 --> 08:15.343
The food that I'm getting
out of that place is scraps.

08:15.345 --> 08:17.929
It's just junk that people are
sending back from the tables.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.807
We're talking gristle, bones,

08:20.809 --> 08:23.350
you know, spit-up from
little baby plates and stuff.

08:23.352 --> 08:25.268
Nothing worth talking about.

08:25.270 --> 08:28.814
In comes this guy one night,
crying and drowning in his own tears,

08:28.816 --> 08:32.068
talking about the thousands
and thousands of dollars

08:32.070 --> 08:34.361
he wasted on his wedding.

08:34.364 --> 08:38.073
So, mainly because of this
wedding videography business...

08:38.075 --> 08:41.159
they're the big guys in town
called Perfect Day.

08:41.162 --> 08:43.578
And so, he hires
these guys, right?

08:43.580 --> 08:45.414
And they're
super professionals, right?

08:45.416 --> 08:49.084
I mean, they were good.
Good-looking guys, right?

08:49.086 --> 08:50.087
Yeah.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.673
Yeah, so, so...

08:53.675 --> 08:57.885
I'm thinking if that kind
of money is going into this,

08:57.887 --> 09:03.101
and the kind of vendor food you're
getting from a wedding on a daily basis,

09:04.099 --> 09:08.521
we're talking mushrooms,
pork roast, roast beef,

09:08.523 --> 09:10.814
roasted potatoes,

09:10.816 --> 09:14.819
ice cream, cookies, right?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.404
Like, top-tier stuff.

09:16.406 --> 09:19.490
It's not all about
the vendor food, okay?

09:19.492 --> 09:23.160
It's about the bride
and the groom

09:23.162 --> 09:24.328
on their special day.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.872
- Just... I can't.
- Wait.

09:25.874 --> 09:28.708
No... Hey, Flynn. Wait.

09:28.710 --> 09:30.459
No, hey, hey.

09:30.461 --> 09:32.211
Hey, hey.

09:32.213 --> 09:33.795
I told you,
I didn't wanna talk about that.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.548
You said you weren't
gonna do this.

09:35.550 --> 09:38.175
Look, I'm not comfortable
with this topic right now.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.593
You wanna talk
to these guys?

09:39.595 --> 09:41.636
You want them to come here
and know our story?

09:41.638 --> 09:44.725
Yeah, well, I didn't
wanna talk about that, okay?

09:45.518 --> 09:48.394
The elephant in the room

09:48.396 --> 09:52.982
is that, well,
Flynn's wife, Sherri,

09:52.984 --> 09:58.445
she left him
for the wedding videographer

09:58.447 --> 10:01.115
that he hired, so...

10:01.117 --> 10:03.575
it's not too cool,
but, you know,

10:03.577 --> 10:05.077
that's just life,
it's just how it went down.

10:05.079 --> 10:07.497
But he says that all this,
and with us becoming

10:07.499 --> 10:11.626
the wedding videographers that we're turning
into, it has nothing to do with that.

10:11.628 --> 10:13.877
This isn't some kind
of big revenge plot.

10:13.879 --> 10:17.216
This is for the money
and the food.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.739
Morning.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.869
Cup of joe.

10:50.041 --> 10:52.710
Let's go and see what the day's
gonna bring, right?

10:55.713 --> 10:57.215
Brand-new day.

11:02.345 --> 11:04.929
Flynn!

11:04.931 --> 11:07.431
Ow!

11:07.433 --> 11:09.976
- Ow!
- What are you do... What are you guys doing?

11:09.978 --> 11:12.937
- Oh, God!
- I've been waiting all day. What are you doing?

11:12.939 --> 11:16.982
Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints, August.

11:16.984 --> 11:19.109
Today happens to be
a landmark day

11:19.111 --> 11:21.194
for the Bergeron Brothers.

11:21.196 --> 11:24.575
Our ad was featured
in the PennySaver.

11:25.826 --> 11:30.831
And we have not one,
but two email inquiries.

11:31.832 --> 11:34.833
They say it takes money
to make money.

11:34.835 --> 11:37.712
Unless you have a cool cousin
who owes you a favor

11:37.714 --> 11:39.424
at the PennySaver.

11:44.137 --> 11:48.514
Okay, uh, Michele Burns
is interested, okay.

11:48.516 --> 11:52.517
It's 412-555-9830.

11:52.519 --> 11:54.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:54.814 --> 11:59.942
- Wh...
- What in the hell are you doing?

11:59.944 --> 12:00.945
What?

12:01.696 --> 12:03.447
I'm...

12:04.157 --> 12:06.656
Dude!

12:06.658 --> 12:09.367
Pre-par-ation!

12:09.369 --> 12:12.497
What has this whole year
been about, huh?

12:12.499 --> 12:13.999
Preparing.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.209
Yeah, but I...
I don't understand.

12:17.211 --> 12:19.712
What do you mean?
What's going on?

12:19.714 --> 12:24.592
Um, okay, how about we book Doris
upstairs for secretary, huh?

12:24.594 --> 12:26.930
So we sound like
a legit company?

12:28.306 --> 12:30.139
Okay, that might work.

12:30.141 --> 12:31.766
What about phone etiquette?

12:31.768 --> 12:33.976
You know anything about that?

12:33.978 --> 12:36.270
Yeah, I've been
on a couple of phones, yeah.

12:36.272 --> 12:38.064
How about we write out
a script

12:38.066 --> 12:40.857
so we know exactly what to say?

12:40.859 --> 12:43.361
I mean, I know I'm the king
of the improv world,

12:43.363 --> 12:46.447
but when it comes to the
professional business world,

12:46.449 --> 12:49.327
that's a whole new ball game,
Augie.

12:51.329 --> 12:53.540
Okay, okay.

12:54.624 --> 12:57.125
You might be right, okay.

12:57.127 --> 12:58.668
It's okay.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.086
Ever since we were kids,

13:00.088 --> 13:03.088
you've always been
this bull-headed guy,

13:03.090 --> 13:05.882
just taking charge
of situations,

13:05.884 --> 13:08.343
even though
he's not capable of them,

13:08.345 --> 13:13.391
same stupid things just come out
of your mouth without thinking.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.060
What have I told you
a million times?

13:17.062 --> 13:20.189
You have to stop

13:20.191 --> 13:23.608
and think.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.696
Okay, sure.

13:27.364 --> 13:29.698
- You're right.
- It's up here.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.700
It's up here.

13:31.702 --> 13:33.454
It's all about preparing.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.372
Preparation.

13:37.374 --> 13:41.461
Preparation.

13:41.463 --> 13:47.132
- Say it.
- Preparation.

13:47.134 --> 13:50.886
Preparation.

13:50.888 --> 13:53.180
You know, I have
a lot of really good ideas,

13:53.182 --> 13:55.808
just sometimes,
some of my bigger ideas

13:55.810 --> 13:59.187
kind of dive headfirst in the shallow
end and snap their necks and die.

13:59.189 --> 14:02.567
But I'd be happy to share some of
them with you out of my sketchbook.

14:06.488 --> 14:09.280
So, here we've got
the turtle-pod.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.991
And here are my hidden
wedding camera ideas.

14:11.993 --> 14:14.202
I was thinking about
just attaching cameras

14:14.204 --> 14:16.871
to things like
Flynn's dorky glasses

14:16.873 --> 14:18.580
and to wedding bouquets.

14:18.582 --> 14:21.416
And I'm currently working
on actual robot women

14:21.418 --> 14:24.002
that we'll attach
the cameras to their heads.

14:24.004 --> 14:26.380
Oh, and here's some other ideas
I've been working on.

14:26.382 --> 14:30.175
You wouldn't understand it, but some
ideas we got going for the future.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.553
That's about it.

14:40.897 --> 14:45.276
Hello, and thank
you for calling the Bergeron Brothers.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.401
Your call is important to us,

14:48.403 --> 14:53.156
so, please, stay on the line
for the video...

14:53.158 --> 14:54.867
wedding...

14:54.869 --> 14:56.535
tape...

14:56.537 --> 14:57.995
of your...

14:57.997 --> 15:01.165
your wedding tape

15:01.167 --> 15:03.959
that we will make for you.

15:03.961 --> 15:05.962
Stupid.

15:05.964 --> 15:08.675
It's okay, it's okay.
We have more tapes.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.133
Just do it again.

15:11.135 --> 15:13.095
You know, a little more heart.

15:14.556 --> 15:16.139
When you're on the phone
with these people,

15:16.141 --> 15:17.806
it's always a "yes-no, yes-no"
kind of thing.

15:17.808 --> 15:19.934
- You have to be ready for the answers, all right?
- Yeah.

15:19.936 --> 15:22.645
- So, if you ever hear a no, you come back with a yes.
- Okay.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.939
- Anytime it's yeah, then it's, no.
- Okay.

15:24.941 --> 15:27.400
Any nah, or meh, or nah,

15:27.402 --> 15:29.651
you always come back
with a yes, yes, yes, all right?

15:29.653 --> 15:31.904
We're talking babies,
funerals, weddings, parades.

15:31.906 --> 15:33.530
Yes, yes, yes, no, all right?

15:33.532 --> 15:34.823
- Every time. Ready?
- Okay.

15:34.825 --> 15:35.949
- No.
- Yes.

15:35.951 --> 15:37.660
- No.
- Yes.

15:37.662 --> 15:39.328
- Yeah.
- No.

15:39.330 --> 15:40.788
- Yes.
- Yes.

15:40.790 --> 15:43.040
- Yes.
- No.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.833
- Eh...
- Yes.

15:44.835 --> 15:46.126
- No.
- Yes.

15:46.128 --> 15:47.462
- Yeah.
- No.

15:47.464 --> 15:48.670
- Baby.
- No.

15:48.672 --> 15:49.671
- Baby.
- No.

15:49.673 --> 15:50.674
Parade.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.723
Yeah, you know, I've been
trying to kick the habit.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.474
You know...

16:00.476 --> 16:02.436
August hates it.

16:03.604 --> 16:06.146
- He keeps trying to get me to quit.
- Flynn!

16:06.148 --> 16:07.564
Flynn, you down here?

16:07.566 --> 16:09.357
- You better not be... Are you smoking?
- No.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.109
Hey... what is that?

16:11.111 --> 16:12.652
Are you smoking?

16:12.654 --> 16:16.116
If you wanna smoke it,
you better be ready to eat it.

16:17.201 --> 16:18.994
In your lungs
and in your belly.

16:22.665 --> 16:24.247
You feel like a big guy now?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.166
You feel like a ball player?

16:26.168 --> 16:29.838
You think twice, hmm?

16:31.090 --> 16:33.218
Now I feel kind of bad.

17:24.394 --> 17:26.938
Go.

17:35.905 --> 17:38.947
- It's ringing, it's ringing.
- Hello?

17:38.949 --> 17:41.742
- Is this Michele Burns?
- This is she.

17:41.744 --> 17:44.330
Please hold
for the Bergeron Brothers.

17:50.378 --> 17:55.964
Hello, and thank you
for calling the Bergeron Brothers.

17:55.966 --> 17:59.176
Your call is important to us,
so, please...

17:59.178 --> 18:01.473
...just stay on the line.

18:04.309 --> 18:06.101
What the heck is going on?

18:06.852 --> 18:08.103
Hello?

18:10.607 --> 18:13.774
Hi, hey! Is this Michele?

18:13.776 --> 18:14.943
This is she.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.446
Uh, we heard maybe you're
interested in us doing your wedding.

18:19.448 --> 18:21.616
Yes, we're currently looking
for a videographer.

18:21.618 --> 18:23.535
I saw your ad
in the PennySaver.

18:25.830 --> 18:28.079
Come on,
this is your part, go!

18:28.081 --> 18:31.082
- Hello?
- Come on, do it.

18:31.084 --> 18:33.168
Do it, do it!

18:33.170 --> 18:35.754
Say something.

18:38.801 --> 18:40.384
What the heck is going on?

18:46.850 --> 18:49.143
Do it.

18:49.145 --> 18:52.605
Well, Michele, this is August
Bergeron with Bergeron Wedding Videography.

18:52.607 --> 18:54.648
Cherish your every moment
forever.

18:54.650 --> 18:59.444
We'll make sure we film everything good
for you so...

19:00.615 --> 19:02.865
Uh, food...
our vendor food.

19:02.867 --> 19:05.784
- Are you gonna have roasted potatoes...
- Hang on one second.

19:05.786 --> 19:08.663
Uh, we're gonna
put you onto mute.

19:08.665 --> 19:12.666
What in the Sam hell are you doing?

19:12.668 --> 19:14.460
- You are blowing this!
- I blanked.

19:14.462 --> 19:15.919
I was thinking about the food.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.421
I can't remember
your hack script.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.632
We need people to think
we are actually good at this.

19:19.634 --> 19:21.970
You know
I can hear you guys, right?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.221
I...

19:25.223 --> 19:26.850
I think she just heard
everything.

19:27.850 --> 19:30.600
Hello? Hello?

19:30.602 --> 19:31.687
Hello?

19:33.231 --> 19:34.563
Oh!

19:34.565 --> 19:37.484
Call her back!
Call her back!

19:38.986 --> 19:41.611
Now, look guys,
you can't call someone over 100 times,

19:41.613 --> 19:43.114
and expect to get a gig.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.533
It's called harassment.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.243
Look, I know, Officer.
We're really sorry.

19:48.245 --> 19:51.999
I just thought we had
our first gig, that's all.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.251
Well, it's good to be
persistent,

19:55.253 --> 19:57.837
though, okay? within the limits of the
law, but you gotta stay

19:57.839 --> 20:02.215
Well, by the law, like, how many
times are we allowed to call somebody?

20:02.217 --> 20:06.553
- Well, I'm not sure, but it can't be 100.
- All right.

20:06.555 --> 20:10.183
- Leave that lady alone, okay?
- Yeah, we will, we will.

20:10.185 --> 20:14.436
- Thank you.
- Thank you... sir, for serving.

20:14.438 --> 20:15.689
Thank you.

20:18.067 --> 20:20.443
This is on you.

20:20.445 --> 20:23.361
- This is on you! We got a record now.
- It's on me?

20:23.363 --> 20:25.364
We got a record.
We could've gotten shot today.

20:25.366 --> 20:28.161
You wanna get arrested?
Do you wanna get arrested?

20:29.495 --> 20:31.412
I've been married six times.

20:31.414 --> 20:34.290
They all died
of freaking natural causes.

20:34.292 --> 20:37.042
Bob was murdered
by an ant colony,

20:37.044 --> 20:39.878
Jim died of a helium overdose,

20:39.880 --> 20:42.380
and Martin got stuck
and suffocated

20:42.382 --> 20:45.886
in a kiddie tube slide,
and so on and so forth.

20:46.888 --> 20:49.057
Nothing surprises me.

20:49.974 --> 20:52.183
Well, what about the other gig?

20:52.185 --> 20:54.268
Yeah, what other gig?

20:54.270 --> 20:57.521
This morning you said
there were two emails.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.109
Oh, look.
Okay, look, look, look. All right.

21:05.697 --> 21:08.200
Nope! Nope!

21:09.284 --> 21:10.742
That's a bummer.
I'm...

21:10.744 --> 21:12.244
- I'm sorry.
- On to the next one.

21:12.246 --> 21:13.495
How about, uh...

21:13.497 --> 21:16.832
Yeah, he...
he must've seen the ad.

21:19.795 --> 21:21.088
You know it's him.

21:22.924 --> 21:25.260
He's not funny.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.011
I know that.

21:30.013 --> 21:33.765
He's a certified beef hack,
for true.

21:33.767 --> 21:38.562
But listen, you said you
would never let a stage grudge

21:38.564 --> 21:41.148
get in the way of our dreams
again, right?

21:41.150 --> 21:43.277
- Did I said that?
- Yeah.

21:44.361 --> 21:46.820
Who's this guy
you're talking about?

21:51.369 --> 21:55.704
Hal Magner.

21:55.706 --> 21:58.624
Uh, hello,
Bergeron Brothers?

21:58.626 --> 22:00.460
This is Hal Magner.

22:00.462 --> 22:03.128
I'm desperately in need
of your videography

22:03.130 --> 22:05.798
for a new cooking show
I'm producing.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.967
I happen to have information
regarding a wedding

22:08.969 --> 22:11.220
for someone very close to me

22:11.222 --> 22:15.015
who happens to be looking
for a wedding videographer.

22:15.017 --> 22:18.435
Give me a ring if you like.
Buh-bye.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.146
This psycho comes out
swinging an axe,

22:20.148 --> 22:22.315
you guys make sure you record
everything, all right?

22:22.317 --> 22:23.526
We need evidence.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.821
- Keep rolling.
- All right, go.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.408
- Welcome!
- Jesus, Hal! Oh.

22:33.410 --> 22:34.618
My God.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.288
My name is Hal Magner,

22:37.290 --> 22:41.751
and I'm what you would call
a Jack of all trades.

22:41.753 --> 22:45.421
I'm an inventor, a poet,
a philosopher,

22:45.423 --> 22:49.424
1997 State Jump Rope Champion,

22:49.426 --> 22:53.514
and now an aspiring
television chef.

22:56.309 --> 22:59.104
- Ugh.
- God, more stairs.

22:59.771 --> 23:02.816
How many freaking stairs
you got in this place?

23:05.359 --> 23:08.069
I am so happy
that you could make it.

23:08.071 --> 23:09.155
You're full?

23:09.947 --> 23:13.657
Okay, what's the plan here,
Hal?

23:13.659 --> 23:15.283
Yeah, let's get this over with.

23:15.285 --> 23:18.870
Oh, patience, boys, patience.

23:18.872 --> 23:22.040
Once we wrap filming,
then I will furnish you

23:22.042 --> 23:26.587
with that contact information
you so desperately seek.

23:26.589 --> 23:28.588
You better, okay?

23:28.590 --> 23:31.216
What are you, uh, cooking
in there today?

23:31.218 --> 23:36.597
Oh, well, for today's video,
I had to sit back and think,

23:36.599 --> 23:41.020
what's the one thing
in life I can't wait for?

23:41.896 --> 23:43.729
- What?
- Oh!

23:43.731 --> 23:48.108
Why, being a grandfather,
of course.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.027
- Oh, Jesus.
- I'm leaving.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.949
- Wait, Flynn...
- Jesus!

23:53.782 --> 23:55.869
- Hello.
- Hubert?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.162
What do want?

23:59.205 --> 24:01.789
You know the rules, Hal...
no guests are allowed.

24:01.791 --> 24:05.667
Oh. These are
the Bergeron Brothers.

24:05.669 --> 24:07.589
They're much more than guests.

24:08.630 --> 24:10.839
They're mine.

24:10.841 --> 24:13.550
- What?
- Very well.

24:13.552 --> 24:16.052
But if I'm interrupted
just once,

24:16.054 --> 24:19.223
you will unleash the fury
of these two fists and legs,

24:19.225 --> 24:21.600
registered lethal weapons.

24:21.602 --> 24:23.937
And I'll tell Mama on you.

24:25.648 --> 24:26.983
Interrupt what?

24:28.193 --> 24:30.612
If you knew, your life
would change forever.

24:34.991 --> 24:37.366
So, to the kitchen?

24:44.250 --> 24:48.922
Did we tell anybody
we were coming here today?

24:57.138 --> 25:01.264
Ah, now, clearly,
I do have some time

25:01.266 --> 25:03.975
before I get to be
a grandfather.

25:03.977 --> 25:07.187
I obviously have to meet
my wife,

25:07.189 --> 25:10.148
breed, raise that child,

25:10.150 --> 25:12.359
wait for that child to breed,

25:12.361 --> 25:17.615
and then I can begin the most
fulfilling years of my life.

25:19.369 --> 25:22.955
What... What's that have to do
with the cooking show, Hal?

25:24.165 --> 25:27.625
Will you please allow me

25:27.627 --> 25:31.464
to set up my show, Augustus?

25:32.506 --> 25:36.675
Because everyone
with a grandfather knows

25:36.677 --> 25:41.263
the best thing about them
is their corny sense of humor.

25:43.225 --> 25:45.225
Jesus Christ.
Look, we're rolling in here.

25:45.227 --> 25:48.523
- We're burning tape, so let's go, come on.
- Oh, okay.

25:49.107 --> 25:52.399
And so, today
I will be preparing

25:52.401 --> 25:56.279
some of America's favorite
corn-based dishes...

25:56.281 --> 26:01.451
buttery corn on the cob,
corn and tomato pasta salad,

26:01.453 --> 26:05.996
corn hush bake,
mustardy grilled corn kabobs,

26:05.998 --> 26:09.332
creamy corn soup,
and a vast array

26:09.334 --> 26:12.002
of fresh and delicious recipes

26:12.004 --> 26:15.673
for whenever you're
up to your ears in corn.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.426
Come on, let's have some fun.

26:20.972 --> 26:22.764
He's gonna kill me.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.270
Ah! Nice and full.

26:29.272 --> 26:31.230
Just turn that on.

26:31.232 --> 26:33.316
This is just so enjoyable.

26:33.318 --> 26:36.694
It's very therapeutic,
you know, just...

26:36.696 --> 26:39.530
oh, just take it, and I just...

26:39.532 --> 26:43.701
Ooh, that cracking,
that cracking... mm-hmm-hmm...

26:43.703 --> 26:46.662
...in the bottom.

26:46.664 --> 26:49.874
Mmm! Am I right?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.002
I know I'm right.

26:59.260 --> 27:01.301
Don't worry about
getting too much of the core.

27:01.303 --> 27:04.096
That just adds to the flavor.

27:04.098 --> 27:06.557
Oh, yeah. Ah, yeah.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.978
That's... mmm,
that's what you want, mm.

27:12.023 --> 27:14.775
Ah!
Really just gotta... oh!

27:15.819 --> 27:17.777
Gotta force it in there,
you know?

27:17.779 --> 27:19.071
Just gotta...

27:32.543 --> 27:34.503
Finger!

27:35.129 --> 27:37.381
- Oh, my God!
- What do we do?

27:38.632 --> 27:40.758
First aid kit!
You get the finger, get the finger.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.510
You gotta get it on ice.

27:44.472 --> 27:47.557
- Look, y'all. Where's the first aid kit?
- Where's the finger?

27:47.559 --> 27:49.436
What is this?
What is this?

27:50.936 --> 27:52.770
You better find it.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.023
The pepper!

27:57.025 --> 27:59.026
What the hell's going on
in here?

28:03.198 --> 28:06.242
Flynn, I got it!
I got the finger.

28:06.244 --> 28:07.909
Oh, great! Get it on ice.

28:07.911 --> 28:09.328
Ice!

28:13.751 --> 28:16.836
Okay, Hal, uh,
let's stick this on there.

28:16.838 --> 28:19.465
Just try to...

28:24.303 --> 28:26.345
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

28:26.347 --> 28:28.473
We're gonna get that finger
back on for you.

28:28.475 --> 28:31.144
August, where's the finger at?

28:32.061 --> 28:33.103
Got it.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.551
Okay.

29:05.302 --> 29:06.927
Okay, let's try it.

29:06.929 --> 29:08.180
- Let's do it
- Okay.

29:17.439 --> 29:20.023
- Hello?
- Is this Michael Magner?

29:20.025 --> 29:23.694
- Please hold on for the Bergeron Brothers.
- What?

29:26.157 --> 29:31.243
Hello, and thank
you for calling the Bergeron Brothers.

29:31.245 --> 29:34.121
It's me, Flynn Bergeron.

29:34.123 --> 29:35.289
And August.

29:35.291 --> 29:38.000
Hey, hi, hello!
This is August Bergeron.

29:38.002 --> 29:41.337
You remember, Doc Stackson
High, Class of '01!

29:41.339 --> 29:43.673
- Big Aug!
- How did you get this number?

29:50.430 --> 29:52.557
Actually, Mullet, we heard
through the grapevine

29:52.559 --> 29:54.519
that you're engaged
to be married.

29:55.311 --> 29:58.186
- Congratulations.
- Yay!

29:58.188 --> 30:00.272
Thanks. Um...

30:00.274 --> 30:04.652
Hey, did you know
that your old high school chums

30:04.654 --> 30:09.365
just happen to run a very successful
wedding videography business?

30:09.367 --> 30:12.742
And it just so happens
that we were lucky enough

30:12.744 --> 30:16.329
to happen to get in touch
with you just in time

30:16.331 --> 30:22.252
for the solid, gold-medal,
bronze baby wiper,

30:22.254 --> 30:27.716
the dove creamy, dove package,
family, feel,

30:27.718 --> 30:31.013
discount, blow-out,
year-end deal.

30:31.973 --> 30:34.684
It's only available
for another...

30:36.394 --> 30:38.478
two minutes.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.812
What's the offer?

30:40.814 --> 30:45.526
Wedding... stock
price, uh, thing here.

30:45.528 --> 30:46.694
It's hot off the press.

30:46.696 --> 30:50.740
Um... price is...

30:50.742 --> 30:55.413
$19,998.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.538
That's too much.

30:57.540 --> 30:59.331
Okay, hang on.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.834
The stocks just dipped.

31:01.836 --> 31:04.462
We're looking it up right now.
It is...

31:04.464 --> 31:07.507
Um...

31:07.509 --> 31:08.799
Wait, hot off the press.

31:08.801 --> 31:14.387
Um, $9,998.42.

31:14.389 --> 31:17.392
Look, guys, I appreciate
you calling, but...

31:21.481 --> 31:22.565
But...

31:23.774 --> 31:26.067
we got you laid.

31:26.069 --> 31:29.111
Guys, that was a long time ago.

31:29.113 --> 31:32.072
I already made an appointment for
a wedding videographer tomorrow.

31:32.074 --> 31:33.950
Well, who do you hire?
Like, who's gonna go...

31:33.952 --> 31:35.451
I bet we'll do
way better than them.

31:35.453 --> 31:36.786
Who is it?

31:36.788 --> 31:39.624
A place called Perfect Day
Video something.

31:40.833 --> 31:43.584
Per... Perfect Day Enterprises?

31:45.170 --> 31:46.712
- Shit!
- I gotta go.

31:46.714 --> 31:49.048
Flynn! Flynn!

31:49.050 --> 31:51.134
Flynn, breathe.

31:51.136 --> 31:52.760
Oh, shit! Breathe!

31:52.762 --> 31:54.304
It's a scorcher.

31:55.223 --> 31:56.224
Oh!

31:57.475 --> 31:59.224
More! Ups!

31:59.226 --> 32:01.476
Flynn! You all right?

32:01.478 --> 32:03.146
Oh, no! You okay?

32:03.148 --> 32:05.606
Are you all right?
Are you all right? Are you okay?

32:05.608 --> 32:08.233
It's the glasses,
it's the glasses.

32:08.235 --> 32:09.484
You all right?
Can you breathe?

32:09.486 --> 32:11.447
Do you see me?
Oh, my God!

32:13.867 --> 32:15.324
Breathe, breathe!

32:15.326 --> 32:16.992
You don't... you okay?
Breathe!

32:16.994 --> 32:19.494
Cold water is good.
Cold water is good.

32:19.496 --> 32:21.246
Okay, okay.

32:21.248 --> 32:23.582
All right, cold water is good.

32:23.584 --> 32:24.791
It's good.

32:24.793 --> 32:27.043
Oh! Oh!

32:27.045 --> 32:29.004
You're okay, okay?

32:29.006 --> 32:31.176
Okay. That's good.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.719
Oh, my God.

32:34.721 --> 32:36.303
You guys get that?

32:36.305 --> 32:37.888
Oh, my God!

32:37.890 --> 32:39.683
You almost flat-lined.

32:40.894 --> 32:44.060
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.732
Did I black out again?

32:47.024 --> 32:48.607
Yeah, you did.

32:48.609 --> 32:51.654
It was only, like,
about, like, five minutes.

32:53.113 --> 32:55.322
You think there's any way

32:55.324 --> 32:57.619
we can get Mike Magner
on board?

32:59.495 --> 33:02.204
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

33:02.206 --> 33:03.541
I mean...

33:04.751 --> 33:09.002
he was acting like we never got his
cherry popped in high school, you know?

33:09.004 --> 33:11.299
I bet he wouldn't deny
that fact to our faces.

33:14.927 --> 33:17.761
Face-to-face.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.431
- What?
- That's it!

33:22.811 --> 33:24.101
What?

33:26.231 --> 33:29.607
- Right here, big old dips.
- Big dips, big dips.

33:29.609 --> 33:31.483
Big dips?
All right, got it. Good.

33:31.485 --> 33:33.528
- It's Kenny Woods style. Here we are.
- Cool.

33:33.530 --> 33:34.986
Is this the main road here?

33:34.988 --> 33:37.280
Brake! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.367
- Okay, pay attention...
- Switch out the batteries.

33:39.369 --> 33:40.867
Make sure that you have
the right tape.

33:40.869 --> 33:42.203
Pay attention to the road!
Brake!

33:42.205 --> 33:44.704
I'm good, okay.
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

33:44.706 --> 33:47.250
Pedestrian,
man checking his mail.

33:47.252 --> 33:50.211
- Do not kill the poor man.
- I got the shakes.

33:50.213 --> 33:52.338
I got the shakes
real bad.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.757
Oh, I got the sugar shakes.

33:54.551 --> 33:57.425
- Hold on a second.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

33:57.427 --> 33:59.886
- Sorry, guys. Sorry guys.
- Sorry, guys. Sorry.

33:59.888 --> 34:01.099
We saved time.

34:05.019 --> 34:08.603
Wait, August, August.

34:08.605 --> 34:09.648
Hey!

34:10.984 --> 34:12.025
August.

34:14.194 --> 34:16.320
And look... under five minutes.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.904
- That's not bad.
- Not bad.

34:17.906 --> 34:19.449
- That's not bad.
- Nah.

34:19.451 --> 34:21.701
I'm not getting back in.
Someone farted in the car,

34:21.703 --> 34:23.913
- I can't breathe in here right now.
- Who farted?

34:25.540 --> 34:28.206
I know it's the sound guy.

34:28.208 --> 34:32.085
- Mullet Mike! Mullet Mike!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:32.087 --> 34:34.505
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.840
Mullet Mike.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.300
He lost the mullet.

34:38.302 --> 34:40.469
- Looks great, more modern.
- Yeah.

34:40.471 --> 34:42.346
Well, what's going on?

34:42.348 --> 34:45.599
Um, I'm Flynn
and August Bergeron.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.976
We're the Bergeron Brothers,
wedding videographers.

34:47.978 --> 34:49.728
Guys, I thought
I made it clear

34:49.730 --> 34:52.273
that we are not interested
in your services.

34:52.275 --> 34:54.733
We've been doing this for so
long, we know the ins and outs.

34:54.735 --> 34:57.612
We know if you're getting screwed,
so just let us come with you.

34:57.614 --> 34:59.572
It'll be of a favor
for old friends, right?

34:59.574 --> 35:02.616
- Yeah, like an engagement gift.
- No, let's go, Michael.

35:06.038 --> 35:09.082
- Judy Bloomers.
- Uh, what did he say?

35:11.210 --> 35:13.126
Did we not hook you up?

35:13.128 --> 35:17.715
Guys, you know, I could've got
myself laid in high school, okay?

35:17.717 --> 35:20.009
Pfft, fat chance.
With that Mullet, no way.

35:20.011 --> 35:22.887
Uh, what the hell
are they talking about?

35:24.516 --> 35:26.808
Look, you know,
maybe they're right.

35:26.810 --> 35:29.518
Let them go up there with us.
You know, like...

35:29.520 --> 35:32.563
I guess we could use an
insider scoop on the business.

35:32.565 --> 35:36.694
Like, I need all the help I can
get to save a couple of bucks.

35:39.154 --> 35:41.279
We are only here to help,
ma'am.

35:44.034 --> 35:45.326
Let's go, guys.

35:45.328 --> 35:47.036
- Yes, yes!
- Yes!

35:47.038 --> 35:50.206
- And now we're even.
- Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

35:50.208 --> 35:53.211
August, will you go grab my sneaky bag?

35:54.753 --> 35:56.337
Your what?

36:15.023 --> 36:17.942
- Magner wedding.
- Yes, that's us.

36:17.944 --> 36:20.902
- I can take you back now.
- Thank you.

36:20.904 --> 36:25.782
And, um, this is
our reality TV show crew.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.909
They're gonna be
joining us today.

36:27.911 --> 36:31.956
And what reality show is this?

36:31.958 --> 36:35.375
Um, it is called...

36:35.377 --> 36:37.087
Virgin Groomzillas.

36:38.464 --> 36:42.090
Of course it is.

36:42.092 --> 36:43.302
Follow me, please.

36:49.768 --> 36:52.268
God damn it, Keither,
if I told you once,

36:52.270 --> 36:54.228
I've told you a million times,

36:54.230 --> 36:57.273
you gotta make the bride
look the best!

36:57.275 --> 36:59.275
The best!
She looks like shit here.

36:59.277 --> 37:00.442
It's a shitty shot.

37:00.444 --> 37:02.527
I feel like shit
as I'm looking at it.

37:02.529 --> 37:04.654
- Don't you?
- Not really.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.032
Look, in here, and also here,

37:07.034 --> 37:10.203
saddlebags here,
a dumpy ass there.

37:10.205 --> 37:11.621
Fix it, moron!

37:11.623 --> 37:13.666
- I want you to fix it.
- I am.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.919
Oh...

37:18.045 --> 37:20.837
Hey, guys.
I didn't see you.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.382
You must be the Magner party.

37:24.384 --> 37:27.302
- Yeah, that's us.
- Great, great.

37:27.304 --> 37:30.683
Oh, I see you brought
the Bergeron Brothers with you.

37:31.391 --> 37:32.766
And a camera crew?

37:32.768 --> 37:35.478
Hey! That's fantastic,
that's great.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.896
Hey, how's the wedding
videography business going?

37:37.898 --> 37:41.233
'Cause... ooh, I heard about
that cooking show you guys did.

37:41.235 --> 37:44.070
- Real blood bath, huh?
- It's going great.

37:44.072 --> 37:46.739
- Money.
- Great success story.

37:46.741 --> 37:48.366
- Good.
- Clients.

37:48.368 --> 37:50.284
Great. That's awesome.

37:50.286 --> 37:54.413
How about I give you guys a quick
tour, show you how the pros do it?

37:54.415 --> 37:57.041
When I got into the wedding
videography business,

37:57.043 --> 38:00.753
there was one common theme
that I noticed missing

38:00.755 --> 38:02.130
from these weddings.

38:02.132 --> 38:03.508
And that was...

38:05.759 --> 38:07.717
good-looking people.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.389
All right, now, I don't want you guys
to freak out, okay, but this is it.

38:11.391 --> 38:15.268
This is the studio,
the home of our patented

38:15.270 --> 38:19.438
facial replacement
and body replacement technology.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.527
Look at this hottie right here.

38:25.029 --> 38:27.737
We can digitally replace
your body

38:27.739 --> 38:32.786
and make you look
like a supermodel.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.668
Seems unnatural.

38:41.003 --> 38:42.587
Nah.

38:42.589 --> 38:44.549
I think her boobs are real.

38:47.134 --> 38:51.387
And then right over here, guys,
we actually have our equipment room.

38:51.389 --> 38:53.973
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, knuckleheads, come on.

38:53.975 --> 38:56.308
That's the top secret,
private, employees only.

38:56.310 --> 38:58.268
Oh! Danny, Bill.

38:58.270 --> 39:01.021
My favorite two dickheads.

39:01.023 --> 39:02.523
How was the wedding last night?

39:02.525 --> 39:03.775
- Totally awesome.
- Awesome.

39:03.777 --> 39:06.902
Spectacular event,
truly triumphant.

39:06.904 --> 39:08.154
Rock and roll.

39:08.156 --> 39:10.364
You guys are doing
a freaking awesome job.

39:10.366 --> 39:12.282
Keep up the good work.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.242
They're a little
too Bill and Ted for me,

39:14.244 --> 39:17.454
but they're actually surprisingly
great cinematographers,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.748
and they work for beer.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.125
So, I mean,
that's an awesome perk for a crew.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.003
Who doesn't love an awesome
photo booth at their wedding?

39:25.005 --> 39:27.255
It's a momentous occasion.
Let's get some pictures.

39:27.257 --> 39:28.925
Here, let me show you
how it works.

39:28.927 --> 39:31.346
- Uh, don't go on there.
- Why?

39:32.429 --> 39:35.514
Sorry, some people had
a little too much fun

39:35.516 --> 39:37.433
in the booth last night.

39:37.435 --> 39:40.228
- I haven't had a chance to clean it yet.
- Too bad.

39:40.230 --> 39:42.688
Being a wedding vendor
is just a way to pay

39:42.690 --> 39:44.109
for my schooling.

39:44.859 --> 39:47.027
I'm studying to be
a foreign ambassador.

39:47.946 --> 39:50.114
Hopefully,
somewhere nice and warm.

39:51.366 --> 39:52.407
Like Berlin.

40:02.627 --> 40:04.045
Oh, God.

40:04.753 --> 40:07.797
Our newest addition
is our catering service.

40:07.799 --> 40:10.967
We've got the best vendor food
that money can buy,

40:10.969 --> 40:14.719
top-of-the-line chefs cooking
the most exquisite food

40:14.721 --> 40:16.348
that you will ever taste.

40:17.308 --> 40:19.599
little cupcake,
Sherri, my delectable

40:19.601 --> 40:22.395
what do we have
for these fine folks to sample?

40:22.397 --> 40:24.563
All right, today,
we actually have...

40:24.565 --> 40:26.023
Flynn!

40:26.025 --> 40:28.194
What are you doing here?

40:29.069 --> 40:33.155
Well, he's here to check out the competition, hon.

40:33.157 --> 40:36.284
Didn't you know that Flynn was a
big wedding videographer guy now?

40:36.286 --> 40:39.078
- No, I actually didn't.
- Well, he is.

40:44.585 --> 40:46.126
Spit it out.

40:46.128 --> 40:48.753
Oh, oh. Flynn!

40:48.755 --> 40:49.838
Flynn.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.300
- Flynn, wait!
- Oh!

40:52.302 --> 40:53.344
Babe.

40:56.139 --> 40:59.056
Well, let's try out
this damn food.

40:59.058 --> 41:01.561
Am I right?

41:05.898 --> 41:08.650
I just forgot how beautiful
she was.

41:10.069 --> 41:13.904
- I just froze up in there. I can't explain it.
- Flynn!

41:13.906 --> 41:15.908
How are you?
Um...

41:16.701 --> 41:18.244
What's all this?

41:19.036 --> 41:22.538
Oh, it's a documentary crew.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.415
Just, um, "documentering"

41:24.417 --> 41:28.503
successful video artists
like myself.

41:28.505 --> 41:30.256
That's really cool, Flynn.

41:32.926 --> 41:34.511
I don't wanna talk to you.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.598
Why? It was over
a year ago now.

41:40.558 --> 41:43.726
You broke my heart, Sherri,
all right?

41:43.728 --> 41:46.145
And now you're working
for the guy too?

41:46.147 --> 41:49.523
He gave me some startup money for
my catering business and it just...

41:49.525 --> 41:52.235
it made sense
to combine the two.

41:52.237 --> 41:55.570
Listen, Chad's a really nice,
sweet guy

41:55.572 --> 41:57.032
once you get to know him.

41:57.784 --> 42:01.494
Yeah, Chad Johnson is sweet.

42:01.496 --> 42:04.621
And I'm a famous basketball
player for the Chicago Butts.

42:04.623 --> 42:07.625
Flynn, I'm sorry.

42:07.627 --> 42:11.753
Yeah, well, "sorry"
isn't good enough, sister.

42:11.755 --> 42:13.965
- I gotta go.
- Flynn, wait.

42:13.967 --> 42:17.175
Just leave me alone!
Forever!

42:17.177 --> 42:18.302
Flynn!

42:19.931 --> 42:21.850
Dude, what the hell?

42:47.875 --> 42:52.003
Hey, uh, August, that's
quite an appetite you got there, buddy.

42:52.005 --> 42:53.673
Yeah, yeah.

42:55.132 --> 42:57.090
I just wanna make sure
it's good for you guys.

42:57.092 --> 43:00.013
I'm just sampling the best
for the best, you know?

43:00.721 --> 43:02.306
Yeah, okay.

43:03.098 --> 43:04.931
Hey, what do you think
of these tarts?

43:04.933 --> 43:08.351
Eh, you know, I'm not really
a tarty kind of guy.

43:08.353 --> 43:11.523
Yeah, well, you're not really
any kind of guy.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.779
- Can I have a try?
- Yeah.

43:20.324 --> 43:22.157
Mmm.

43:22.159 --> 43:25.119
Kinda peachy, moist.

43:25.121 --> 43:26.331
It's not bad.

43:31.085 --> 43:32.212
Try this one.

43:36.299 --> 43:38.090
- What do you think?
- Mmm!

43:38.092 --> 43:39.634
That's very good.

43:39.636 --> 43:42.594
- It's... it's not too sweet.
- Yeah?

43:42.596 --> 43:45.723
- I like it, mm-hmm.
- Good, good.

43:45.725 --> 43:48.226
- Now, try this one.
- All right, all right, you creep!

43:48.228 --> 43:50.603
- Come on, dude.
- What? What's the matter?

43:50.605 --> 43:53.105
- Is it too much cream?
- Yeah, it's all right.

43:53.107 --> 43:55.690
I don't mind a little extra
cream with my dessert.

43:55.692 --> 43:56.985
Me either.

44:01.241 --> 44:03.909
So, if you guys don't mind,

44:04.868 --> 44:06.870
can't let any of this
go to waste.

44:09.165 --> 44:11.208
Uh, anyone seen Flynn anywhere?

44:12.918 --> 44:14.045
Ugh.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.045
They've always been that way.

44:20.634 --> 44:22.425
All right, thank you.

44:22.427 --> 44:24.679
Mikey, get the prices.

44:24.681 --> 44:28.599
You'll find all of our prize
packages in our brochure right here.

44:28.601 --> 44:29.724
Thank you.

44:29.726 --> 44:31.226
Michele Burns?

44:31.228 --> 44:33.520
I'll take you
and your fiancé back now.

44:33.522 --> 44:36.023
- Thank you.
- Burns.

44:36.025 --> 44:37.983
Burns.
Michele Burns, right?

44:37.985 --> 44:39.569
It's me, August.

44:39.571 --> 44:41.362
Of the Bergeron Brothers.
You remember?

44:41.364 --> 44:44.449
- Oh, you.
- Yeah, yeah. You know what?

44:44.451 --> 44:46.784
I'm sorry we couldn't meet
your needs the other day,

44:46.786 --> 44:49.078
but, you know, maybe the next
one, we'll get ya.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.998
I don't think you can meet
anyone's needs, you psychopath.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.918
Word of advice... stay away from
this creep and his freak brother.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.130
Some deals just aren't worth it.

45:01.176 --> 45:02.427
Okay.

45:06.681 --> 45:09.431
Talk about bridezillas, huh?

45:15.022 --> 45:17.773
Oh, look at this shit, August.

45:17.775 --> 45:21.361
There's a comma there,
there, and there?

45:22.529 --> 45:24.239
Oh, God.

45:26.159 --> 45:28.703
Well, see you later.

45:37.503 --> 45:38.835
Oh, hey, man.

45:38.837 --> 45:40.922
Are you guys
wedding videographers too?

45:40.924 --> 45:42.799
Yeah, yeah, we are.

45:42.801 --> 45:44.257
Do you need a sound editor?

45:44.259 --> 45:45.717
This place sucks, man.

45:45.719 --> 45:48.637
Nah, nah, sorry, dad.
We can't afford you, man.

45:48.639 --> 45:51.849
We don't have any money.
But I tell you what.

45:51.851 --> 45:55.396
If you can score some more of this
vendor food, we can make a deal.

45:56.397 --> 45:59.315
You know, we all went
to high school together.

45:59.317 --> 46:00.485
We did?

46:01.194 --> 46:03.985
Holy... holy, crap!
Yeah, yeah.

46:03.987 --> 46:06.404
Uh, Keither, Keither Cannon.

46:06.406 --> 46:08.116
Creepy Keither, the goth kid.

46:08.118 --> 46:10.617
- That's me, dude.
- Ah, wow, man.

46:10.619 --> 46:13.411
I... I thought your eyes
were, like, permanently dilated.

46:13.413 --> 46:15.038
Those were just contacts, bro.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.166
- Cool, okay.
- Yeah.

46:17.168 --> 46:21.503
Yeah. I mean, yeah, if you're
down, then, yeah, hook us up.

46:21.505 --> 46:22.882
Yeah, sounds good.

46:30.764 --> 46:33.224
You just made the best choice
in your life, brother.

46:33.226 --> 46:34.769
If you say so.

46:36.478 --> 46:37.605
Later.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.942
Creepy Cannon.

46:42.944 --> 46:44.112
Unbelievable.

46:49.826 --> 46:50.866
Small world.

46:50.868 --> 46:52.494
Hey, Bergeron. Hey!

46:55.331 --> 46:57.456
What's up, Mullet?

46:57.458 --> 46:59.583
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but, um...

46:59.585 --> 47:03.045
you think you guys can do
as good a job as these guys can?

47:03.047 --> 47:05.005
Oh, guaranteed, yeah.

47:05.007 --> 47:09.009
'Cause they are a little
out of my pay grade here.

47:09.011 --> 47:10.013
Yeah?

47:11.054 --> 47:13.681
How about
we'll do it for half?

47:13.683 --> 47:15.724
- Yeah, how about 500 bucks?
- Deal.

47:15.726 --> 47:17.811
- All right.
- Yeah.

47:24.569 --> 47:26.735
Yeah.
Yup.

47:26.737 --> 47:29.198
You've made the best choice
in your life.

47:32.618 --> 47:35.579
Flynn!
Hey, Flynn, we got a job!

47:36.623 --> 47:37.706
Flynn!

47:38.833 --> 47:41.127
Why do I feel like I just made
a huge mistake?

47:42.795 --> 47:44.129
Shit.

47:45.757 --> 47:47.882
Tell me a bit about that

47:47.884 --> 47:49.300
with the Bergeron Brothers.

47:49.302 --> 47:52.552
- What was your excuse?
- Oh. Oh, goodness, um...

47:52.554 --> 47:57.016
I don't like to say anything bad,
really, but they're a little psycho.

47:57.018 --> 47:59.309
I would not recommend them.

48:39.518 --> 48:43.353
And I was like...

48:45.607 --> 48:47.900
They were so good.

48:47.902 --> 48:49.860
It's really exciting here.

48:49.862 --> 48:54.239
- It's Keither's first day on job.
- First day.

48:54.241 --> 48:58.034
We know he's sleeping
or he could be dead.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.871
He was making some noises
last night,

48:59.873 --> 49:02.248
but it's 5:02, and he's not
up and ready to roll.

49:02.250 --> 49:05.333
There was crying and, like,
weird cat noises and things.

49:05.335 --> 49:06.710
- So, it was...
- Yeah.

49:06.712 --> 49:09.212
No more rest! Time to get up!

49:13.011 --> 49:15.887
All right, Keither!
Welcome to the crew, buddy!

49:15.889 --> 49:18.556
Come on, come on, go, go, go!
Come on, man!

49:21.226 --> 49:24.520
- Drunk uncle.
- I've been drinking all day.

49:24.522 --> 49:27.398
August, you broke another cone.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.108
I'm going through this
training course,

49:29.110 --> 49:31.985
and it's made me stronger
and faster than I've ever been.

49:31.987 --> 49:33.279
And it's really helped.

49:33.281 --> 49:35.197
Ring bearer's down!

49:35.199 --> 49:38.784
Ring bearer's down! What are you gonna do?
You gonna leave him down?

49:38.786 --> 49:41.036
To work
for the Bergeron Brothers...

49:41.038 --> 49:43.163
I've never quite seen
anything like it.

49:44.708 --> 49:46.793
Where's the bathroom?

50:23.373 --> 50:24.996
Good morning.

50:24.998 --> 50:28.291
You look really pretty.

50:28.293 --> 50:31.753
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:31.755 --> 50:33.840
What are you two...
what are you doing in here?

50:33.842 --> 50:36.050
Get outta here!
Get outta here!

50:36.052 --> 50:37.552
What's with you?
Get outta here!

50:37.554 --> 50:39.929
Oh, my God, this is
totally unnecessary!

50:39.931 --> 50:42.181
- Go!
- I don't have my face on.

50:42.183 --> 50:43.891
- Oh, my God.
- Get outta here!

50:43.893 --> 50:46.351
I just wanted to see
a little bit of something.

50:46.353 --> 50:48.020
We're trying to make them
look right.

50:48.022 --> 50:50.523
Trying to get it all going
all at the same time.

50:50.525 --> 50:52.900
- Just trying to get some sound.
- Gotta be in the right kind of mood.

50:52.902 --> 50:54.777
All right, guys,
stay out, all right?

50:54.779 --> 50:56.362
Look, we're filming it.

50:56.364 --> 50:57.824
Mikey.

50:59.951 --> 51:02.579
Man,
maybe we should've called.

51:04.581 --> 51:06.496
You know, we were
under the impression

51:06.498 --> 51:10.918
that the Bergeron Brothers were
actual wedding videographers

51:10.920 --> 51:13.920
because they told us they were.

51:13.922 --> 51:17.842
We didn't really see the red
flags until it was too late.

51:17.844 --> 51:20.094
Well, I mean,
like, they had equipment

51:20.096 --> 51:22.137
and they seem like
they know how to use it.

51:22.139 --> 51:24.931
Yeah, but, you know,
handling a garden hose

51:24.933 --> 51:27.394
doesn't exactly make you
a fireman.

51:30.355 --> 51:35.525
♪ You are the one
I always loved ♪

51:35.527 --> 51:38.070
♪ I always loved you ♪

51:38.072 --> 51:40.530
♪ Then you broke my heart ♪

51:40.532 --> 51:42.366

51:42.368 --> 51:48.079

51:50.125 --> 51:52.960
- Morning, fellas.
- Hey!

51:52.962 --> 51:55.630
Mullet Mikey!

51:55.632 --> 51:57.465
Is everything okay in there?

51:57.467 --> 51:58.925
Yeah, it's okay.

51:58.927 --> 52:00.342
It's just that, you know,

52:00.344 --> 52:04.306
you guys caught us
a little off-guard this morning.

52:05.141 --> 52:06.181
Oh, yeah?

52:06.183 --> 52:07.808
Well, what about your fiancée?

52:07.810 --> 52:09.351
Is she satisfied?

52:09.353 --> 52:10.562
What?

52:12.190 --> 52:14.315
Awake? Is she awake?

52:14.317 --> 52:17.275
- Yeah, August, she's awake.
- Okay, cool, let's...

52:17.277 --> 52:20.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Guys, guys.

52:21.031 --> 52:24.909
I hired you guys
as wedding videographers.

52:24.911 --> 52:28.996
Can't we just
sort of stick to the wedding?

52:28.998 --> 52:33.375
Look, Mullet Mikey, okay?

52:33.377 --> 52:37.963
This is an all-inclusive
package, my friend.

52:37.965 --> 52:41.219
Okay? There's no extra charge
for us being here.

52:42.052 --> 52:43.471
Thanks.

52:44.389 --> 52:49.141
But, I mean, really, though,
thanks for such a good deal, you know?

52:49.143 --> 52:52.145
I really dodged a bullet...
those other guys.

52:52.147 --> 52:54.813
I mean, I don't know
if you know this,

52:54.815 --> 52:58.402
but I'm sort of paying for
this whole thing out of pocket.

53:01.029 --> 53:03.114
Do you know
if there's any parade

53:03.116 --> 53:05.243
scheduled to come by
on his block today?

53:06.368 --> 53:08.328
- What?
- For audio.

53:09.038 --> 53:11.121
- No!
- Cool.

53:11.123 --> 53:12.750
Well, let me know
if one comes by.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.170
Parade...

53:17.714 --> 53:19.132
I love a parade.

53:20.967 --> 53:24.177
I thought that the father of the
bride pays for the whole wedding.

53:24.179 --> 53:26.929
You know, like the classic hit
comedy Father of the Bride?

53:26.931 --> 53:29.016
- Steve Martin.
- Classic.

53:29.933 --> 53:31.683
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

53:31.685 --> 53:36.565
It's just that Mel's
been married a few times,

53:37.192 --> 53:41.194
and he said that
he's not going to be

53:41.196 --> 53:43.072
paying for any more weddings.

53:45.032 --> 53:48.951
Look, Mikey, I get it, okay?

53:48.953 --> 53:53.246
You wanna be a man and take
charge of the situation,

53:53.248 --> 53:56.543
you know, show her
what you're capable of.

54:00.047 --> 54:02.130
Sure, Flynn.

54:02.132 --> 54:05.592
We're gonna be here for you
every step of the way, all right?

54:05.594 --> 54:09.223
We're gonna make the best God-darn
wedding video you ever saw.

54:14.020 --> 54:15.563
Ah.

54:19.859 --> 54:21.360
Ah!

54:25.739 --> 54:27.116
Ah!

54:32.663 --> 54:36.373
Thanks guys, okay?

54:36.375 --> 54:39.043
And that's coming
out of your pay, okay?

54:39.045 --> 54:40.547
That's Pier 1.

54:42.005 --> 54:44.297
Fuck.

54:44.299 --> 54:46.134
And make a note of that
for the budget.

54:46.136 --> 54:48.719
- Noted.
- Coming out of our pay.

54:48.721 --> 54:51.139
I know dealing
with the Bergeron Brothers,

54:51.141 --> 54:55.308
filming every single moment
might seem extreme,

54:55.310 --> 54:59.230
but I see it as a great way
to capture the early days,

54:59.232 --> 55:04.569
you know, those moments leading
up to that first big step.

55:04.571 --> 55:07.279
Well, my fourth big step.

55:07.281 --> 55:09.658
I was married three times
before this one.

55:10.451 --> 55:12.328
Right.

56:18.853 --> 56:20.978
Sure, it's still exciting
getting married,

56:20.980 --> 56:23.980
even though you've done it
a few times before.

56:23.982 --> 56:26.192
It's like watching
your favorite movie...

56:26.194 --> 56:29.402
even if your husband ends up
disappearing at the end,

56:29.404 --> 56:32.405
or gets drafted to the war,

56:32.407 --> 56:35.242
or his car
falls into the ocean.

56:35.244 --> 56:37.161
I mean, you still laugh
at all the jokes.

56:37.163 --> 56:38.538
Am I right?

56:43.043 --> 56:44.960
This is our catalog
of wedding cakes,

56:44.962 --> 56:47.255
starting with the most
expensive in the front.

56:47.257 --> 56:51.342
Okay, uh, that'll do.

56:51.344 --> 56:54.219
I can't find
anybody to come to the wedding.

56:54.221 --> 56:55.512
Oh, nobody? No one?

56:55.514 --> 56:57.389
Well, why? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

56:57.391 --> 57:00.102
- You don't know anyone?
- I have no friend...

57:00.728 --> 57:02.520
Keither!

57:02.522 --> 57:06.440
Okay, our friend Mr. Mullet Mike
seems to not know enough people

57:06.442 --> 57:09.110
to be able to make his wedding
look really nice and full up,

57:09.112 --> 57:11.154
and it's gonna ruin our video...

57:11.156 --> 57:13.822
it's gonna ruin his video,
so we need you to get

57:13.824 --> 57:15.949
as many guests as you can
to show up.

57:15.951 --> 57:16.953
I'm on it.

57:32.427 --> 57:34.384
Right there.
Come up from the front there.

57:34.386 --> 57:36.762
- Just be happy...
- What's wrong with your face?

57:36.764 --> 57:39.724
- Look at the camera.
- Hold! Hold!

57:39.726 --> 57:41.808
Okay, get that one right there.
That's good.

57:41.810 --> 57:43.895
- Okay, cool.
- That was terrible.

57:43.897 --> 57:46.230
- Try this... hold.
- Which camera am I looking at?

57:46.232 --> 57:48.483
- Excellent, awesome.
- Is that okay?

57:48.485 --> 57:50.067
We got flowers.
We're good?

57:50.069 --> 57:52.697
Just hold the flowers.
Just get this...

57:53.614 --> 57:56.699
- Okay, you can't take a picture if the...
- Take the picture!

57:56.701 --> 58:00.661
- Okay, boom, boom.
- My eyes were closed that whole time.

58:00.663 --> 58:02.663
- I can't...
- I don't know who I'm looking at.

58:02.665 --> 58:04.665
- It's kind of hard to smile with...
- Okay.

58:04.667 --> 58:06.375
- Hold that one right there.
- Just...

58:06.377 --> 58:08.585
- Hold it!
- I feel like that's in front of my face.

58:08.587 --> 58:10.212
Just smile, just hold quick.

58:10.214 --> 58:11.672
Get this over with.
Okay.

58:11.674 --> 58:14.007
- Hold it, hold it!
- Is that supposed to happen?

58:14.009 --> 58:15.967
You know you're...
you're on fire.

58:15.969 --> 58:18.012
I'm out,
I'm out, I'm out!

58:18.014 --> 58:19.971
August!

58:19.973 --> 58:21.933
August, you okay?

58:21.935 --> 58:24.561
- It's on fire!
- I think you got it.

58:30.192 --> 58:31.817
Everyone okay?

58:31.819 --> 58:33.402
You guys all right?

58:33.404 --> 58:35.195
- Jesus.
- You guys okay?

58:35.197 --> 58:36.616
I could've died.

58:44.790 --> 58:46.417
Shit.

58:50.295 --> 58:52.462
Daddy!

58:52.464 --> 58:56.259
My Mellybean!

58:56.261 --> 58:58.177
There she is.

58:58.179 --> 59:00.598
Mel's father, Mr. Senicci.

59:01.723 --> 59:03.266
What's all this shit?

59:03.268 --> 59:07.856
Uh, this is
the documentary crew.

59:08.647 --> 59:11.232
Oh, so you wasted your money
on camera crew

59:11.234 --> 59:14.737
instead of a half-decent hall
for a reception?

59:15.529 --> 59:17.612
Jesus, this looks like the place

59:17.614 --> 59:19.868
where they used to hold
my AA meetings.

59:22.078 --> 59:24.536
Okay, there we go.

59:24.538 --> 59:25.998
All right, guys, come on in.

59:26.875 --> 59:28.960
Good, good, good, nice and easy.

59:31.920 --> 59:35.382
Christ, this is the place
they held those AA meetings.

59:36.926 --> 59:38.677
It's perfect!

59:39.679 --> 59:42.014
I can see the wonder in it.

59:42.806 --> 59:44.724
Yeah, I wonder
what that smell is.

59:47.978 --> 59:49.645
Um, excuse me.

59:49.647 --> 59:52.815
If I may, Mr. "Senick-ci,"
sir, Your Honor, Emperor,

59:52.817 --> 59:56.110
can I take your beautiful
goddess, warrior princess daughter

59:56.112 --> 59:59.112
and sort of walk around
the whole premises,

59:59.114 --> 01:00:00.741
like you showing it off?

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:04.576
Excellent idea, August.
Excellent.

01:00:04.578 --> 01:00:06.829
We can match it up with the
father-daughter dance later.

01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:10.875
That's what I was thinking.
See, great minds think on bikes.

01:00:10.877 --> 01:00:13.880
Uh... it's "think alike."

01:00:15.672 --> 01:00:17.591
You know, not "on bikes."

01:00:19.552 --> 01:00:21.054
Are you sure about that?

01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:25.389
"Bikes..."
I'll Google it later.

01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:26.768
Come on, let's go.

01:00:31.855 --> 01:00:33.232
Do you have a decorator?

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.858
No, not exactly.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.527
Mel's cousin Annie's
gonna come by,

01:00:38.529 --> 01:00:43.075
hang a couple of things up, but,
you know, not a lot, of course.

01:00:44.953 --> 01:00:46.744
Looking good.
It's looking good.

01:00:46.746 --> 01:00:50.081
So, how long have you been
doing this, son?

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:53.416
Um, skipping?

01:00:53.418 --> 01:00:56.712
No, your camera
business thing.

01:00:56.714 --> 01:00:59.340
My wedding videography
business.

01:00:59.342 --> 01:01:04.887
Oh, like, about
200-300 days now.

01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:07.806
Oh... oh, my God.

01:01:07.808 --> 01:01:09.599
That's the smell.

01:01:09.601 --> 01:01:10.976
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:01:10.978 --> 01:01:12.105
Wait.

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:15.605
Is that... is that alive?

01:01:18.527 --> 01:01:19.571
Okay, yep.

01:01:24.284 --> 01:01:25.824
- What do you think?
- Good.

01:01:25.826 --> 01:01:27.701
Subtle, thanks.

01:01:27.703 --> 01:01:29.119
I get it.

01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:30.913
This is your brother's gig,
ain't it?

01:01:30.915 --> 01:01:35.462
And you latched on 'cause you're
the little brother, right?

01:01:36.962 --> 01:01:37.964
Well...

01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:40.591
only by, like, nine months.

01:01:43.302 --> 01:01:44.846
Grow some balls.

01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:47.221
Take charge.

01:01:47.223 --> 01:01:50.016
See, that's what I would do.

01:01:50.018 --> 01:01:51.351
Balls.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.937
Just let it go, okay?

01:01:59.194 --> 01:02:02.737
I will never let go, okay?

01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:04.614
Then I'm going to do that.

01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:07.949
I'm going to grow balls
and I'm going to grab them.

01:02:07.951 --> 01:02:10.244
"Melanachicia," listen,

01:02:10.246 --> 01:02:11.996
I was just talking
to your dad over there,

01:02:11.998 --> 01:02:13.915
and he was telling me
to grab my balls,

01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:16.666
and I think we just need to be
open about our relationship.

01:02:16.668 --> 01:02:18.376
Let them know
what we're talking about.

01:02:18.378 --> 01:02:20.378
Wh... what are you talking about?

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.882
You picked me, all right?

01:02:22.884 --> 01:02:25.592
Now you're stuck with me, okay?

01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:30.014
Every turn, every angle,
I will be right there,

01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:31.849
with or without a camera.

01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:34.768
What's going on with you and Mullet
Mike, it's not gonna last.

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.270
I can do better.

01:02:36.272 --> 01:02:38.105
Let me take his place.

01:02:38.107 --> 01:02:41.067
I can... I got
a video guy already.

01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:44.362
I mean, this is why
you chose us, all right?

01:02:44.364 --> 01:02:46.697
This is what we're here for.

01:02:46.699 --> 01:02:48.949
- Wait! No, wait.
- Get...

01:02:48.951 --> 01:02:51.034
- Okay.
- Are we getting married?

01:02:51.036 --> 01:02:53.204
Okay, Flynn, look,
you're creeping me out.

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.581
Knock it off, okay?

01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:57.375
- Let go!
- Hey, what's going on?

01:02:57.377 --> 01:03:00.210
Mikey, get your crazy friend
off of me!

01:03:00.212 --> 01:03:04.005
What...

01:03:04.007 --> 01:03:07.217
How long is this affair
been going on, you Jezebel?

01:03:07.219 --> 01:03:08.302
What?

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:13.266
Oh, my God, enough!

01:03:13.268 --> 01:03:14.683
Get outta here, you two!

01:03:14.685 --> 01:03:17.186
You've been driving us crazy
since day one.

01:03:17.188 --> 01:03:19.438
You're... you're fired!

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.857
Yeah, get out!

01:03:20.859 --> 01:03:23.275
I'm sorry, baby.

01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:24.944
This is all my fault, you know?

01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:27.572
I thought I was having doubts
about this whole wedding thing.

01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:30.324
It turns out these two psychos
are just driving me nuts.

01:03:30.326 --> 01:03:31.741
You know, I love you.

01:03:31.743 --> 01:03:36.288
- I wanna be with you.
- Oh, baby, I love you too.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.292
Mwah!

01:03:39.627 --> 01:03:43.128
That was beautiful!

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.547
Okay, maybe we can take it
one more time.

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:47.967
We'll do, like,
an over-the-shoulder type shot,

01:03:47.969 --> 01:03:49.134
something like that.

01:03:49.136 --> 01:03:51.804
Aw. Aw, that sounds great.

01:03:51.806 --> 01:03:53.266
Get out!

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:55.851
Aug, you okay?

01:03:57.436 --> 01:03:59.688
- August.
- Hey, guys, how'd it go?

01:04:00.355 --> 01:04:02.940
- August.
- What?

01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:05.025
What the heck
was that all about?

01:04:05.027 --> 01:04:06.485
What?

01:04:06.487 --> 01:04:08.737
Um, you lost
your cool in there, that's what.

01:04:08.739 --> 01:04:10.739
You lost your cool, Flynn.

01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.867
You proposed
to the B-to-be.

01:04:13.869 --> 01:04:17.329
Well, there's...
there's no rules against it.

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:21.541
I'd say it's a
pretty solid unspoken rule.

01:04:21.543 --> 01:04:23.418
- Well, I mean...
- Come on, let's calm down.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.128
Let's just go back
to the garage.

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:28.424
Let's do the training,
get ready for the next gig.

01:04:28.426 --> 01:04:31.259
What gig, Flynn?
There are no other gigs.

01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:34.846
What's with you being able to
say what we do all the time, huh?

01:04:34.848 --> 01:04:36.809
Why can't I make a decision?

01:04:37.601 --> 01:04:39.059
I don't make
all the decisions.

01:04:39.061 --> 01:04:42.896
I just... I'm a born leader.
I just can't help it.

01:04:42.898 --> 01:04:45.775
Okay, so why can't I take
the lead at least once?

01:04:45.777 --> 01:04:47.235
Okay, fine.

01:04:47.237 --> 01:04:48.945
What do you wanna do,
fearless leader?

01:04:48.947 --> 01:04:51.449
- What do you wanna do next?
- Okay, well...

01:04:53.034 --> 01:04:55.076
- Let's go kite flying.
- Um, yeah, no.

01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:57.619
Come on, we need to go back.
Let's do the training.

01:04:57.621 --> 01:04:59.288
Let's get back to it.

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.165
Why can't we go kite flying?

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:04.793
Okay, one, it's not
windy enough, okay?

01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:06.587
B, it's stupid.

01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:09.715
And three, we need
to get back to training.

01:05:09.717 --> 01:05:11.925
Training,
that's what we do for gigs.

01:05:11.927 --> 01:05:13.552
We train for the next thing.

01:05:13.554 --> 01:05:15.971
There's no other next thing,
okay?

01:05:15.973 --> 01:05:17.598
We're out here wasting our time.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.893
We're barely videographers,
let alone wedding videographers.

01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:22.478
So who cares?

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.396
I care, all right?

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:28.692
Smart people make their money
doing weddings, okay?

01:05:28.694 --> 01:05:30.069
You know that.

01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:32.154
Oh, it's the smart people
we're worried about.

01:05:32.156 --> 01:05:34.322
Smart people.

01:05:34.324 --> 01:05:35.868
Like Sherri?

01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:40.496
Watch your mouth, young man.

01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:41.583
You watch it.

01:05:44.085 --> 01:05:45.835
Is that it?

01:05:45.837 --> 01:05:48.837
Is that what this
is all about? Huh?

01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.715
You blow all our money
getting some documentary crew

01:05:51.717 --> 01:05:54.386
to chase us around
like a bunch of idiots, huh?

01:05:55.471 --> 01:05:58.514
To impress your ex,
to win her back,

01:05:58.516 --> 01:06:02.893
running around dumb weddings,
barely making any money, huh?

01:06:02.895 --> 01:06:05.645
So that just by some chances,
she's out there working too,

01:06:05.647 --> 01:06:08.232
so then maybe you connect
across the room,

01:06:08.234 --> 01:06:12.027
huh? smoking your dumb
cigarettes, maybe in the back,

01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:15.239
And then maybe exchange numbers,
and go out to some cool cafe bar

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:17.326
where they play dumb music, huh?

01:06:18.578 --> 01:06:22.454
Oh, and then you maybe get married
again and you don't include me?

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:26.625
at the back? and you leave a
little August And you have babies,

01:06:26.627 --> 01:06:28.835
That's what this
is all about, huh?

01:06:28.837 --> 01:06:29.922
Yeah!

01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:33.632
Maybe it is. Yeah, so?

01:06:33.634 --> 01:06:36.053
Good God almighty, Flynn!

01:06:36.888 --> 01:06:38.346
Unbelievable!

01:06:38.348 --> 01:06:40.264
And you drag me around
through all this

01:06:40.266 --> 01:06:43.016
so that you don't look stupid,
huh?

01:06:43.018 --> 01:06:46.228
Yeah, I mean, it'll be pretty
obvious if I had to do it by myself.

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:48.480
Oh, my God, that's it.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.148
I'm out, I'm done.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:51.358
I quit, Flynn.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.819
You're on your own.

01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:53.987
August.

01:06:55.697 --> 01:06:56.907
August!

01:06:57.951 --> 01:06:59.491
Fine!

01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:01.954
Just go fly your kite!

01:07:02.956 --> 01:07:06.209
Flynn.

01:07:07.793 --> 01:07:10.504
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Music preference?

01:07:12.132 --> 01:07:15.174
Look, Keither,
I'm gonna have to put you

01:07:15.176 --> 01:07:18.846
on involuntary
permanent layoff.

01:07:19.889 --> 01:07:22.559
The company
is experiencing some...

01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:25.268
cutbacks.

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.355
Wow, that's a bummer.

01:07:28.105 --> 01:07:29.646
Yeah, I know.

01:07:29.648 --> 01:07:32.484
You wanna get some beers and
hang in the cemetery with me?

01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:35.402
Sounds delightful.

01:07:35.404 --> 01:07:36.862
I just can't.

01:07:36.864 --> 01:07:38.114
We don't have to get beers.

01:07:38.116 --> 01:07:40.282
We can just hang
in the cemetery.

01:07:40.284 --> 01:07:41.493
It's nice and quiet.

01:07:42.494 --> 01:07:44.536
- Bye, Keither.
- Bye, Flynn.

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:46.538
I'll snap you from the cemetery.

01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:55.774
I had the day open,
so I figured I'd just come

01:08:55.776 --> 01:09:01.406
and see how things went for my
old pal Mullet Mike, you know?

01:09:06.328 --> 01:09:07.371
August?

01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:10.332
Is that August over there?

01:09:12.167 --> 01:09:13.419
August.

01:09:14.962 --> 01:09:16.171
Is that you?

01:09:17.965 --> 01:09:19.091
Hey...

01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:23.385
Hey, Mr. Spielberg, Steven.
Hey, what's up bud?

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:27.555
You know, I can't wait to make that new
dinosaur action shark movie with you.

01:09:27.558 --> 01:09:29.559
I just wanna thank you
for that lobster dinner

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.688
and all that champagne and the
naked-breasts women that you gave me, so...

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:35.354
I gotta go.

01:09:35.357 --> 01:09:36.899
Actually,
there's a butt hole here

01:09:36.901 --> 01:09:38.943
to get the knife
out of my back, so...

01:09:38.944 --> 01:09:41.072
All right, ciao, bye.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:48.496
Hey, Augie.

01:09:49.496 --> 01:09:50.622
Flynn.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.294
Sounds like you've been
pretty busy.

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.920
I've been trying to get
ahold of you.

01:09:57.922 --> 01:10:00.006
Yeah, well...

01:10:00.008 --> 01:10:03.803
I see you still have
your documentary crew with you.

01:10:05.262 --> 01:10:08.598
Yeah, you know, they wanna
see this thing through,

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.643
and I have a feeling
that you do too.

01:10:12.645 --> 01:10:14.770
Mm, yeah, fat chance.

01:10:14.772 --> 01:10:16.689
I was actually looking
for my dog.

01:10:16.691 --> 01:10:19.775
I don't know if you've seen him.
He's really big and cool.

01:10:19.777 --> 01:10:21.068
Uh...

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.028
I was about to get him
neutered, actually,

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:27.826
'cause I didn't want him
running off for some bitch.

01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:36.626
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:10:36.628 --> 01:10:39.921
I should have never
used our business

01:10:39.923 --> 01:10:42.715
for my love redemption.

01:10:42.717 --> 01:10:47.513
I mean, it was stupid
and I'm sorry, okay?

01:10:49.848 --> 01:10:53.225
Okay.
Well, I am sorry too.

01:10:53.227 --> 01:10:55.310
You know, I don't mean
to be such a ball buster.

01:10:55.312 --> 01:10:56.897
Just, there's a lot going on.

01:10:58.066 --> 01:11:01.361
And I don't really have
a neutered dog.

01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:04.197
Yeah, I know.

01:11:04.864 --> 01:11:08.323
Yeah, he actually did run away
before I can get it snipped off.

01:11:08.325 --> 01:11:10.494
So, if you see him...

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.204
we gotta get him.

01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:18.000
Well, what do you say maybe
we head back to the garage,

01:11:18.002 --> 01:11:20.836
heat up some vendor food,
ravioli, cake,

01:11:20.838 --> 01:11:22.880
whatever you got in the cabinet,

01:11:22.882 --> 01:11:27.885
and maybe get back
to planning our next gig?

01:11:27.887 --> 01:11:29.970
You know what?
I mean, it sounds good.

01:11:29.972 --> 01:11:32.974
Yeah, we could do that,
but we just need to hold off on the pasta.

01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:37.228
I've been packing it in these
past couple days, guilt eating.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:38.563
I had to go see a doctor.

01:11:38.565 --> 01:11:40.105
Actually, he prescribed me

01:11:40.107 --> 01:11:45.318
with some kind of super...
super blockage breaker.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.530
It knocks me loose real quick,
if you know what I mean.

01:11:48.532 --> 01:11:51.160
It's... it's pretty
hard-core shit.

01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:55.246
- That's gross.
- Yeah.

01:11:55.248 --> 01:11:57.292
So...

01:11:59.419 --> 01:12:01.042
we cool?

01:12:01.044 --> 01:12:02.629
Yeah. I...

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.715
I missed you, man.

01:12:06.758 --> 01:12:07.926
I missed you too.

01:12:10.722 --> 01:12:13.475
Okay, it's okay.

01:12:14.558 --> 01:12:16.559
- Mm
- That's really nice.

01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:19.105
You don't see guys
hugging it out anymore.

01:12:20.606 --> 01:12:23.357
- What? Keither?
- Yeah.

01:12:23.359 --> 01:12:26.109
Can... Cannon,
what are you doing here?

01:12:26.111 --> 01:12:27.237
Working.

01:12:29.824 --> 01:12:31.698
Wait, working what?

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.076
The Magner wedding.

01:12:33.911 --> 01:12:35.663
- What?
- Magner wedding? He...

01:12:37.248 --> 01:12:39.709
Mikey can't afford Perfect Day.

01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:42.376
I don't know whatever you did
to get fired,

01:12:42.378 --> 01:12:46.087
but her dad knows a guy
that knows another guy

01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:49.716
that beat up a guy who owes
money to another guy,

01:12:49.718 --> 01:12:51.426
and that guy happens to be
Chad's dad.

01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:53.514
So, Chad has to do
the wedding for free.

01:12:55.892 --> 01:12:57.475
Man!

01:12:57.477 --> 01:13:00.185
You really got to give it
to a guy like Mr. "Senunchucks."

01:13:00.187 --> 01:13:01.770
Yeah.

01:13:01.772 --> 01:13:05.108
But, yeah, Chad is having me
doing grip production work,

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:07.318
which is more or less
just untangling wires,

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.569
and changing batteries out,
and shit like that.

01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.199
- Bitch work. It sucks.
- Yeah?

01:13:13.575 --> 01:13:14.826
Well, I better roll.

01:13:14.828 --> 01:13:17.744
I gotta go get Chad
his "frothy" latte.

01:13:17.746 --> 01:13:19.997
Him and Sherri are holed up
in the men's room,

01:13:19.999 --> 01:13:21.998
not letting no one in,
no one out.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.128
Everyone has to pee in the ladies
room or in the kitchen sink, so...

01:13:31.553 --> 01:13:33.385
Man!

01:13:33.387 --> 01:13:36.471
I can't stand
that Chad Johnson, man.

01:13:36.473 --> 01:13:38.640
Can you believe that?

01:13:38.642 --> 01:13:41.978
our wedding!
This was supposed to be

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.521
God, let's just get
outta here, man.

01:13:44.523 --> 01:13:46.774
I wanna get lost
before Sherri sees me.

01:13:46.776 --> 01:13:48.653
I'm gonna look like
a real chump.

01:13:49.654 --> 01:13:51.990
- Yeah.
- Let's just get outta here.

01:13:52.574 --> 01:13:53.657
Hmm.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.410
Um...

01:13:56.369 --> 01:13:57.993
That's something, huh?

01:13:57.995 --> 01:14:00.287
That Chad Johnson,
he's a real piece of work.

01:14:00.289 --> 01:14:01.788
Yeah, I hate him.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:05.042
Yeah, the way he kind of
swooped in and took what was...

01:14:05.044 --> 01:14:08.503
what was ours,
what was yours, you know?

01:14:08.505 --> 01:14:12.507
So he can get in there and
do all kinds of weird things

01:14:12.509 --> 01:14:15.094
with his high-def equipment

01:14:15.096 --> 01:14:20.183
so he could watch it
over, over, over again.

01:14:20.185 --> 01:14:22.020
God, I hate that guy.

01:14:22.603 --> 01:14:23.771
What if, uh...

01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:27.982
What if something
were to happen to him, you know?

01:14:27.984 --> 01:14:29.609
Something to throw him off

01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:31.568
on this big, important day,

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.945
something super gross,

01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:38.828
something in front
of our high-quality cameras?

01:14:40.038 --> 01:14:44.165
Huh? Something that
we can watch

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:47.419
over and over and over again.

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:49.380
How about that?

01:14:50.339 --> 01:14:51.673
I'm not following you.

01:14:56.221 --> 01:14:58.807
Here comes the groom.

01:15:06.647 --> 01:15:08.064
Ah.

01:15:51.692 --> 01:15:53.775
Um, sorry to interrupt,

01:15:53.777 --> 01:15:56.278
but here's your latte, sir.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.613
God damn it, Keither.

01:15:57.615 --> 01:16:00.283
I wanted this
exactly 10 minutes ago.

01:16:00.285 --> 01:16:01.783
Whoa! Jeez, man.

01:16:01.785 --> 01:16:03.368
Now go get me
another one.

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:06.037
And maybe don't take
an hour this time?

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:07.292
Yes, sir.

01:16:12.379 --> 01:16:14.755
Rock and roll, boys.

01:16:14.757 --> 01:16:17.091
Oh, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

01:16:17.093 --> 01:16:20.802
- I have a lot to do. I don't have time for this.
- Excuse me?

01:16:20.804 --> 01:16:25.390
You don't have time
to pleasure your fiancé?

01:16:25.392 --> 01:16:27.518
You do know how stressed out
I get, right?

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.145
- I... I need this.
- I'm sorry, honey, I can't.

01:16:30.147 --> 01:16:32.230
I'm not in the mood for this.

01:16:32.232 --> 01:16:35.486
I'm shorthanded today, and I have a
million things to do, and you know that.

01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:39.322
I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

01:16:39.324 --> 01:16:41.407
- Take off your pants.
- No.

01:16:41.409 --> 01:16:43.533
Chad, stop being an asshole.
I said "no."

01:16:43.535 --> 01:16:47.037
- Go off your damn pants!
- Get the hell off of me!

01:16:47.039 --> 01:16:48.915
Flynn!

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:53.085
No means no!

01:16:55.423 --> 01:16:59.966
- Get off of him!
- Oh, you some kind of hero now, huh?

01:16:59.968 --> 01:17:05.139
What, you think you can just come
back in here and win her back, Flynn?

01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:08.225
- Stop!
- She's never gonna go back with a weakling like you.

01:17:08.227 --> 01:17:10.978
You're a little pussy, baby,
mommy's boy, Flynn.

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.479
That's how you've always been.

01:17:12.481 --> 01:17:14.398
That's how you're
always gonna be.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.234
You and that idiot brother
of yours.

01:17:16.236 --> 01:17:17.734
Chad, stop!

01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:20.195
You Bergeron Brothers
ain't gonna amount to anything.

01:17:20.197 --> 01:17:22.323
I'll make sure of that.
Guess what.

01:17:22.325 --> 01:17:24.074
I'll make sure
the whole town knows

01:17:24.076 --> 01:17:28.162
what gigantic moron losers
you guys really are!

01:17:28.164 --> 01:17:30.122
And they're gonna
remember me, baby,

01:17:30.124 --> 01:17:32.875
Chad, as an awesome dude,

01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:36.711
doing sweet-ass,
cool-ass things, okay?

01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:40.257
I'm gonna be
a goddamn leg... end.

01:17:40.259 --> 01:17:43.010
A legend...

01:17:52.271 --> 01:17:54.855
- Did he hurt you?
- No, I'm fine.

01:17:54.857 --> 01:17:56.607
Thank you, Flynn.

01:17:56.609 --> 01:17:58.069
You're hurt.

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.451
Holy shit!

01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:08.536
God!

01:18:11.749 --> 01:18:13.875
What was that?
Was that me?

01:18:13.877 --> 01:18:15.251
Yeah, well, back up.

01:18:15.253 --> 01:18:17.211
- Okay, okay...
- Was that my asshole?

01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:19.296
Oh, my God, he's bleeding!

01:18:19.298 --> 01:18:21.506
- Who?
- Somebody call 911.

01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:23.341
Ah! Yes, 911, yes!

01:18:23.343 --> 01:18:25.385
- Go, go! Move, move!
- Am I bleeding?

01:18:25.387 --> 01:18:26.889
Am I blee... am I bleeding?

01:18:28.057 --> 01:18:30.183
Is my butt hole bleeding?

01:18:59.004 --> 01:19:00.712
Wow.

01:19:00.714 --> 01:19:03.342
That was a whole lot of poop.

01:19:04.552 --> 01:19:06.763
- Did not expect that.
- No.

01:19:07.554 --> 01:19:09.223
Oh, these poor guys.

01:19:12.017 --> 01:19:15.480
Hey, do you know
what I see here?

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.271
Pssh, a big old shitty mess.

01:19:18.273 --> 01:19:20.735
Well, yeah,
aside from that, though.

01:19:21.527 --> 01:19:22.820
I see a film crew.

01:19:23.987 --> 01:19:25.738
Oh, yeah.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:28.366
A film crew
without their leader.

01:19:28.368 --> 01:19:29.660
Oh, yeah.

01:19:34.874 --> 01:19:36.666
Okay, okay.

01:19:36.668 --> 01:19:38.667
I got this. I got this.

01:19:41.004 --> 01:19:43.922
Hey, um...
can I get everyone's attention?

01:19:43.924 --> 01:19:46.509
Can I just get, ahem,
everyone's attention over here?

01:19:46.511 --> 01:19:48.260
Come on up, please.

01:19:48.262 --> 01:19:50.720
Listen up, listen up.

01:19:50.722 --> 01:19:53.224
All right, listen, guys.

01:19:53.226 --> 01:19:56.226
I understand this sucks, okay?

01:19:56.228 --> 01:20:00.605
And I want you to erase
your memory of all of this here,

01:20:00.607 --> 01:20:05.569
and that your boss almost
forcibly raped his fiancée,

01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:09.448
and sprayed shit all over the
place for you guys to clean up,

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.074
and my brother
knocked him out cold,

01:20:11.076 --> 01:20:13.243
but don't... just erase
all of that from you,

01:20:13.245 --> 01:20:16.913
because even though
your dickhead boss

01:20:16.915 --> 01:20:21.502
almost shit himself to death,
we still have a wedding to do.

01:20:21.504 --> 01:20:22.589
Am I right?

01:20:24.132 --> 01:20:28.717
So, no longer are you all working
for Perfect Day Enterprises.

01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:32.930
As of now, you're all working
for me, August,

01:20:32.932 --> 01:20:36.184
and my brother here, Flynn,

01:20:36.186 --> 01:20:40.104
the Bergeron Brothers
Wedding Videographers.

01:20:40.106 --> 01:20:41.316
Sound good?

01:20:43.234 --> 01:20:44.817
Now, of course
we're gonna be serious,

01:20:44.819 --> 01:20:46.277
and we're gonna get down
to business,

01:20:46.279 --> 01:20:51.657
but most important,
we're gonna have some fun, okay?

01:20:51.659 --> 01:20:52.869
Trust me.

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:55.202
We got this?

01:20:55.204 --> 01:20:56.578
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.873
All right, people,
you heard my brother, okay?

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:02.251
Let's clean
the rest of this shit up,

01:21:02.253 --> 01:21:05.128
and, uh, let's film a wedding!

01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:06.215
Yeah!

01:21:07.883 --> 01:21:09.132
All right, guys, all right.

01:21:09.134 --> 01:21:11.887
Okay, come on.
Let's get geared up.

01:21:21.772 --> 01:21:23.355
I got you.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:28.822
Don't worry about it, though.

01:21:30.824 --> 01:21:31.948
You know what, Mikey?

01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:33.201
Let me tell you what.

01:21:37.496 --> 01:21:38.539
You're all right.

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:41.415
Yeah.

01:21:41.417 --> 01:21:44.001
Yeah, I'm...

01:21:44.003 --> 01:21:45.255
I'm all right.

01:22:25.378 --> 01:22:27.920
Vases down here...
one, two, and three.

01:22:27.922 --> 01:22:29.755
There you go.
You got it, you got it.

01:22:29.757 --> 01:22:31.841
Here, make that look good.
That's cool.

01:23:02.749 --> 01:23:04.372
Hey, hey, hey!

01:23:04.374 --> 01:23:06.751
Whoa, what's the ratio
all about here, man?

01:23:06.753 --> 01:23:09.211
Come on, mix.
Tongs! Tongs!

01:23:37.032 --> 01:23:39.117
Mel! Okay, Mel.
I got you, good shot.

01:23:39.119 --> 01:23:41.493
We need to get this. Does this look good?

01:23:41.495 --> 01:23:44.747
- Ow! It's all right... Jesus.
- Go, get out of here!

01:23:59.222 --> 01:24:01.096
What are you guys
doing in here?

01:24:01.098 --> 01:24:03.558
Can I get, like, a minute?

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.268
What?

01:24:08.231 --> 01:24:09.564
Oh, come...

01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:11.149
Come on.
Like, what is that?

01:24:11.151 --> 01:24:12.774
Like, why would you
even do that?

01:24:32.004 --> 01:24:35.297
And track, and track.

01:24:35.299 --> 01:24:36.884
And track.

01:24:43.516 --> 01:24:44.768
Right.

01:25:04.536 --> 01:25:06.412
All right...

01:25:22.347 --> 01:25:23.473
Whoo!

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.183
I'm actually doing it.

01:25:27.185 --> 01:25:29.685
And who gives
this woman away?

01:25:29.687 --> 01:25:31.645
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:25:31.647 --> 01:25:32.939
I guess that would be me.

01:25:32.941 --> 01:25:34.023
Here you go.

01:25:34.025 --> 01:25:35.235
All right.

01:25:36.986 --> 01:25:40.822
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here on this joyous occasion

01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:44.369
to join this couple
in holy matrimony.

01:25:44.994 --> 01:25:46.493
Repeat after me.

01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:48.871
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:25:48.873 --> 01:25:52.669
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:25:53.837 --> 01:25:55.502
Okay.

01:25:55.504 --> 01:25:57.671
Repeat after me.

01:25:57.673 --> 01:26:00.132
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:26:00.134 --> 01:26:04.222
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:26:07.307 --> 01:26:09.476
By the power vested in me...

01:26:10.102 --> 01:26:13.061
I pronounce you man and wife.

01:26:13.063 --> 01:26:16.524
You may kiss the bride.

01:26:16.526 --> 01:26:18.319
Mwah!

01:26:21.071 --> 01:26:23.322
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to present

01:26:23.324 --> 01:26:27.368
for the first time,
Mr. and Mrs. Magner.

01:26:36.795 --> 01:26:41.090
All right, we're just waiting
out here for the bride and groom,

01:26:41.092 --> 01:26:43.091
and we're gonna blow
some bubbles.

01:26:43.093 --> 01:26:47.345
And it's gonna be a nice,
joyous occasion, and, um...

01:26:47.347 --> 01:26:51.477
- Oh, wait, here they come.
- Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles, bubbles!

01:26:54.938 --> 01:26:57.273
Thank you, guys.

01:26:57.275 --> 01:27:00.527
Yeah, congratulations!

01:27:05.909 --> 01:27:09.078
- Bubbles, bubbles!
- I love bubbles.

01:27:22.926 --> 01:27:26.510
Now presenting
Michael and Melanacia Magner.

01:27:31.142 --> 01:27:33.518
We got married!

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.519
All right, babe!

01:27:35.521 --> 01:27:39.023
Whoo!

01:27:39.025 --> 01:27:40.899
- Thanks for the open bar.
- Oh, no problem.

01:27:40.901 --> 01:27:42.859
- That's awesome.
- Yes, sir? Yes?

01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:46.029
- Wait...
- Love this!

01:27:49.828 --> 01:27:52.161
Guys, the cake
was just delivered.

01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:54.540
- Great. Awesome.
- Go, go, go.

01:27:57.627 --> 01:27:59.292
You know, that's what
I'm thinking...

01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:01.628
It's doesn't matter.

01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:03.296
It's gonna have to be
a short shot.

01:28:03.298 --> 01:28:04.341
Look.

01:28:05.468 --> 01:28:07.135
That cheap son of a bitch!

01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:08.679
What are we gonna do?

01:28:09.347 --> 01:28:12.140
Um, you know, maybe we can do,
like, micro slices,

01:28:12.142 --> 01:28:14.684
or we could draw straws
and see who gets cake.

01:28:14.686 --> 01:28:16.060
That's not gonna work.

01:28:16.062 --> 01:28:17.728
Have you seen this crowd?

01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:19.564
Well, Flynn...

01:28:19.566 --> 01:28:20.984
Um...

01:28:22.276 --> 01:28:24.234
Oh, I got it!
I got an idea.

01:28:24.236 --> 01:28:25.360
Um...

01:28:25.362 --> 01:28:27.947
You, guy folding napkins!
Here.

01:28:27.949 --> 01:28:29.991
Take my car,
go back to our apartment.

01:28:29.993 --> 01:28:31.868
Go inside the cabinet
marked "venue desserts"

01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:34.162
and bring back every goddamn
piece of cake you find there.

01:28:34.164 --> 01:28:35.246
Now, go!

01:28:35.248 --> 01:28:37.709
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:28:38.668 --> 01:28:40.792
That chicken can fly.

01:28:40.794 --> 01:28:43.045
Who was that guy?

01:28:49.137 --> 01:28:51.720
Je... Oh, Jesus.

01:28:51.722 --> 01:28:53.430
Hey, Hal.

01:28:53.432 --> 01:28:57.894
Um, are you having a good time?

01:28:57.896 --> 01:28:59.063
You...

01:28:59.772 --> 01:29:03.399
You beat it, Bergeron.

01:29:03.401 --> 01:29:06.068
I'm really sorry about
what happened to your finger.

01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:10.655
I... I know it was
really important to you.

01:29:10.657 --> 01:29:13.703
What if I give you a chance
to redeem yourself?

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:22.001
Nothing short of a culinary
miracle will help my chances

01:29:22.003 --> 01:29:26.588
of getting laid and finding
the grandmother

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:29.218
of my future grandkids.

01:29:32.304 --> 01:29:34.182
Culinary miracle, huh?

01:29:36.267 --> 01:29:37.811
I think I got an idea.

01:29:48.987 --> 01:29:51.197
Introducing our special guest
cake decorator

01:29:51.199 --> 01:29:53.698
and award-winning
jump rope champion,

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.452
Hal "Manger"
and his lady-pleasing finger.

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:02.792
- Yeah, Hal!
- All right!

01:30:02.794 --> 01:30:05.168
- Yeah!
- All right, Hal!

01:30:10.008 --> 01:30:12.301
- I think it'll work.
- I would eat that.

01:30:12.303 --> 01:30:14.554
- A clean piece. Ready?
- Okay.

01:30:14.556 --> 01:30:16.973
- One... Be good.
- Nice and easy.

01:30:16.975 --> 01:30:18.850
- Yeah, no problem.
- Go.

01:30:18.852 --> 01:30:22.230
Mmm!

01:30:23.397 --> 01:30:24.440
That's nice.

01:30:26.276 --> 01:30:30.068
All right, everybody,
it's the time we've all been waiting for,

01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:33.365
the first dance
of the bride and groom.

01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:36.868
This is it.
This is the big dance.

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:38.577
- We gotta get this.
- Okay, we're good.

01:30:38.579 --> 01:30:40.246
We got this.
Okay, you rolling?

01:30:40.248 --> 01:30:41.749
So... come on, record.

01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:45.083
Bat... battery's dead.

01:30:45.085 --> 01:30:47.127
- Battery's dead?
- Yeah, it's dead.

01:30:47.129 --> 01:30:49.255
Keither, Keither!

01:30:49.257 --> 01:30:51.506
- Where's Keither?
- I'm rolling, I'm rolling!

01:30:55.304 --> 01:30:57.889
Drunk uncle! Drunk uncle!

01:30:57.891 --> 01:31:00.140
- Come on!
- I got the shot.

01:31:00.142 --> 01:31:02.601
I got it!

01:31:02.603 --> 01:31:04.770
- Move! Wait, move!
- I got him!

01:31:04.772 --> 01:31:07.189
- Okay...
- Holy sh...

01:31:07.191 --> 01:31:09.942
Oh, my God,
the camera!

01:31:13.239 --> 01:31:14.947
Get the camera!

01:31:14.949 --> 01:31:17.492
- I just broke the camera!
- Get the shot!

01:31:17.494 --> 01:31:19.743
Get the shot!
I'm gonna get it!

01:31:19.745 --> 01:31:21.537
I'm gonna get it!
I'm getting it!

01:31:21.539 --> 01:31:23.038
Ah! Damn!

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.250
No... nobody's getting
the shot!

01:31:26.252 --> 01:31:28.377
No one's getting it!

01:31:28.379 --> 01:31:30.671
I'm screwing it up again!

01:31:30.673 --> 01:31:32.631
Oh, shit!

01:31:38.138 --> 01:31:42.308
Whyyy?

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:44.060
Whew!

01:31:44.062 --> 01:31:46.186
- Did I look good?
- Yeah, damn good, baby.

01:31:46.188 --> 01:31:47.688
- Damn good.
- Thank you.

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:49.357
Heh-hey! Wow!

01:31:49.359 --> 01:31:51.943
- That was fantastic.
- Thank you.

01:31:51.945 --> 01:31:55.904
I mean, I didn't think
you guys had it in you.

01:31:55.906 --> 01:31:59.449
- Wow! Really impressive.
- I tried really hard.

01:31:59.451 --> 01:32:01.327
Just... little, minor thing.

01:32:01.329 --> 01:32:03.746
Um, we're gonna
have to do that again,

01:32:03.748 --> 01:32:07.291
'cause the camera broke and
the batteries fell out of this,

01:32:07.293 --> 01:32:08.751
and there were
some drunk uncles.

01:32:08.753 --> 01:32:10.670
No, no, no...
no, I don't care, I don't care.

01:32:10.672 --> 01:32:13.506
- Everybody, get back to where you were.
- You don't understand.

01:32:13.508 --> 01:32:15.341
It took me two months
to learn that.

01:32:15.343 --> 01:32:17.467
My friend, Fallon, at the club
took two months

01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:19.302
out of her life
to teach me that dance.

01:32:19.304 --> 01:32:21.012
- I am not doing that again.
- She's not.

01:32:21.014 --> 01:32:24.686
- Mikey, I didn't get the shot.
- Hey, that won't be necessary.

01:32:25.687 --> 01:32:26.980
I got the shot.

01:32:32.485 --> 01:32:33.695
I got the shot.

01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:36.903
I got the shot.

01:32:36.905 --> 01:32:38.115
So did I.

01:32:38.866 --> 01:32:40.824
I got the shot too.

01:32:40.826 --> 01:32:43.911
- I got the shot.
- I got the shot.

01:32:43.913 --> 01:32:46.665
- I got the shot.
- I got the shot.

01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:49.377
I got the shot too.

01:32:51.212 --> 01:32:52.795
I got the shot.

01:32:52.797 --> 01:32:54.299
Wow, that's better than mine.

01:32:56.593 --> 01:32:58.676
It's beautiful.

01:32:58.678 --> 01:33:01.554
Yeah,
you're lucky, Flynn.

01:33:01.556 --> 01:33:03.641
Thank you, everybody.

01:33:05.142 --> 01:33:06.810
Continue on.

01:33:32.419 --> 01:33:36.338
And that's, uh...
that's it right there.

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:39.968
That's the shot
that everyone wants.

01:33:40.887 --> 01:33:44.764
Yeah, I mean, we have
a ton of weddings lined up

01:33:44.766 --> 01:33:47.015
and they all want this shot.

01:33:47.017 --> 01:33:51.019
- It's like a new fad, they call it.
- Yeah.

01:33:51.021 --> 01:33:54.732
Like, Ellen wanted us to be on
her show and some cooking shows,

01:33:54.734 --> 01:33:57.568
but we just don't have
the time for it, you know?

01:33:57.570 --> 01:33:59.989
Yeah, we've been
really busy.

01:34:01.365 --> 01:34:05.659
But now, actually, we set up
about 127 different GoPros

01:34:05.661 --> 01:34:09.037
around the bride and groom,
and just capture it all at once.

01:34:09.039 --> 01:34:12.416
Yeah.
But this is the first one.

01:34:12.418 --> 01:34:15.545
This is the one
that started it all.

01:34:15.547 --> 01:34:17.799
Hey, guys, Keither here.

01:34:19.843 --> 01:34:22.092
Go ahead, Keither.
This is August.

01:34:22.094 --> 01:34:24.347
Someone's out back
to see Flynn.

01:34:28.935 --> 01:34:31.478
Well, hello there,
Mr. Famous Videographer.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.521
Aw, jeez, Sherri.

01:34:34.523 --> 01:34:36.149
I'm not famous.

01:34:36.151 --> 01:34:41.239
I just did something really
wonderful for an old friend.

01:34:43.074 --> 01:34:45.076
I haven't talked to you
since the wedding.

01:34:46.535 --> 01:34:49.038
Yeah, we've been pretty busy.

01:34:50.205 --> 01:34:54.542
Listen, I, uh... I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

01:34:54.544 --> 01:34:56.252
for everything
that I put you through,

01:34:56.254 --> 01:35:00.592
and I wanted to thank you for
helping me with Chad that day.

01:35:02.009 --> 01:35:03.216
Don't mention it.

01:35:03.218 --> 01:35:05.637
Um... is he okay?

01:35:07.139 --> 01:35:08.555
He's all right.

01:35:08.557 --> 01:35:10.640
They had to amputate
part of his small intestine,

01:35:10.642 --> 01:35:15.063
and now he poops into a bag,
but I guess he'll be okay.

01:35:16.191 --> 01:35:19.444
- Ah, jeez, that's gross.
- Yeah. Um...

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:21.862
Listen...

01:35:23.572 --> 01:35:25.155
I messed up.

01:35:25.157 --> 01:35:27.283
I should've never have left you.

01:35:27.285 --> 01:35:29.327
You're a wonderful man.

01:35:29.329 --> 01:35:31.412
And, honestly, I just...

01:35:31.414 --> 01:35:33.583
I just don't know
what I ever saw in Chad.

01:35:35.168 --> 01:35:36.795
I was wondering if you...

01:35:38.504 --> 01:35:40.255
if you could take me back.

01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:49.137
You know, I was really hoping
you'd asked me that.

01:35:49.139 --> 01:35:50.598
Really?

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.560
Oh, thank you, Flynn!

01:35:53.977 --> 01:35:55.644
Wait, wait.

01:35:55.646 --> 01:35:57.397
No, I'm sorry.

01:35:58.357 --> 01:36:01.194
I didn't mean to give you
the wrong impression by that.

01:36:02.736 --> 01:36:06.699
There's no way I can
take you back, Sherri.

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:08.993
Are you kidding?

01:36:10.035 --> 01:36:14.497
No, I'm not, okay?

01:36:14.499 --> 01:36:16.501
You broke my heart.

01:36:18.419 --> 01:36:21.464
You broke it
into a million pieces, Sherri.

01:36:23.258 --> 01:36:25.718
This past year has been
the worst.

01:36:28.721 --> 01:36:32.305
You left me
for some giant douche bag

01:36:32.307 --> 01:36:34.891
with a big, hairy donger

01:36:34.893 --> 01:36:37.938
and big, fat wallet,

01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:40.607
a bunch of cool suits.

01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:45.196
You left me for him
on our wedding day.

01:36:48.991 --> 01:36:52.619
You thought the grass
was greener on the other side?

01:36:53.663 --> 01:36:55.623
Well, I'm here to tell you
it's not.

01:36:56.624 --> 01:36:58.626
It's not green
on the other side.

01:36:59.502 --> 01:37:03.628
It's brown and gross,
just like the bathroom was

01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:06.551
when your fiancé
almost pooped himself to death.

01:37:11.263 --> 01:37:12.347
Look...

01:37:12.932 --> 01:37:17.353
anything in the world.
I loved you more than

01:37:20.106 --> 01:37:22.025
And I probably always will.

01:37:24.276 --> 01:37:26.737
But right now,

01:37:27.946 --> 01:37:29.656
I just need some space.

01:37:31.534 --> 01:37:33.369
'Cause I'm really busy today...

01:37:35.204 --> 01:37:39.458
maybe you should just
get the heck outta here.

01:37:55.517 --> 01:37:57.140
Flynn, it's a drunk uncle!

01:37:57.142 --> 01:37:58.475
Look out!
Get ready for it!

01:37:58.477 --> 01:38:00.394
- Get ready for it, come on!
- I got the shot.

01:38:00.396 --> 01:38:01.938
Frame it up!
He's turned to the side.

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.648
Calm down, sir.
I got the shot.

01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:05.483
- Good, good, and set.
- I got the shot.

01:38:05.485 --> 01:38:06.818
Good, that's great.

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.985
You never know
when he's coming at you, man.

01:38:08.987 --> 01:38:11.197
Nice, good shot.
Good job, man.

01:38:11.199 --> 01:38:12.323
Pretty good, not bad.

01:38:12.325 --> 01:38:13.991
I don't know
if maybe our doc crew...

01:38:13.993 --> 01:38:15.451
if our doc crew is still ready.

01:38:15.453 --> 01:38:17.953
Are those rascals trained
for that drunk uncle?

01:38:17.955 --> 01:38:21.123
Ah...
They've been through a lot.

01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:22.917
Cool, man.
Good, good, good.

01:38:22.919 --> 01:38:24.460
We're good.

01:38:24.462 --> 01:38:25.629
Nice.

01:38:26.755 --> 01:38:27.963
Whoa.

01:38:27.965 --> 01:38:30.132
It's, um... All right.

01:38:30.134 --> 01:38:31.386
We're just gonna hug.

01:38:32.678 --> 01:38:33.970
It's...

01:38:33.972 --> 01:38:36.096
Hey, man, good?

01:38:36.098 --> 01:38:37.725
You all right?

01:38:38.601 --> 01:38:40.103
Yeah, I think so.

01:38:41.855 --> 01:38:43.438
Okay.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.105
Position one, position one!

01:38:45.107 --> 01:38:47.692
Let's go, reset!
Let's go, let's go!

01:39:24.521 --> 01:39:27.230
Now that she said "I do,"

01:39:27.232 --> 01:39:29.358
let the Bergeron Brothers

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.572
do the rest for you.

01:39:39.495 --> 01:39:42.246
