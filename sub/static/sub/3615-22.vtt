WEBVTT

00:01.417 --> 00:02.109
Okay, I think
we made it.

00:02.209 --> 00:04.651
I'm sure we made it.
Do you think we made it?

00:04.751 --> 00:05.412
I don't know,
but I think

00:05.422 --> 00:07.484
he would have attacked
by now if we hadn't.

00:07.584 --> 00:08.776
Who? Who
would've attacked?

00:08.876 --> 00:09.526
Why won't you tell me

00:09.626 --> 00:10.983
what's going on?
Because
we're busy

00:11.083 --> 00:12.359
trying to save your life.

00:12.459 --> 00:13.526
From who?!
Uh...

00:13.626 --> 00:14.734
unfortunately,
we're not quite sure.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.859
That's because Phoebe
did not give us

00:16.959 --> 00:18.109
enough time to figure it out.

00:18.209 --> 00:19.818
Well, I didn't have
a lot of time.

00:19.918 --> 00:20.412
I mean, I can't control

00:20.422 --> 00:22.651
how far in the future
my premonitions take place.

00:22.751 --> 00:26.899
I saw the attack, we kicked
butt-- what more do you want?

00:26.999 --> 00:27.818
I would like
to know more

00:27.918 --> 00:28.704
about who we
are up against.

00:28.714 --> 00:29.899
Okay, Phoebe,
maybe you should check

00:29.999 --> 00:31.359
the <i>Book of Shadows,
</i> see if you can find

00:31.459 --> 00:33.899
anything else on this
demonic hit man, okay?

00:33.999 --> 00:35.109
Excuse me, demonic?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.234
PIPER:
And how to vanquish him.

00:36.334 --> 00:37.245
That would be
a good thing to know,

00:37.255 --> 00:39.359
and do not get sidetracked
with the Cole potion thingy,

00:39.459 --> 00:41.899
because the only ones
we're concerned about saving

00:41.999 --> 00:44.083
right now is ourselves.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.567
PRUE:
Uh... o-okay,

00:46.667 --> 00:47.359
what Cole potion?

00:47.459 --> 00:49.025
Oh, he told her
that he only killed

00:49.125 --> 00:51.192
because some demon
cast a spell on him.

00:51.292 --> 00:52.899
How naive is that?
Oh, I thought

00:52.999 --> 00:54.818
she was over him.
Apparently not.

00:54.918 --> 00:55.776
GRIFFITHS:
Who the hell
are you

00:55.876 --> 00:56.899
talking about?
First you tell me

00:56.999 --> 00:57.899
my life's in danger.

00:57.999 --> 00:59.109
Then you abduct me from my work.

00:59.209 --> 01:01.899
Now you're talking
about demons and witches?

01:01.999 --> 01:02.829
Who the hell
are you people?

01:02.839 --> 01:04.233
PRUE:
Look, I know that
this all sounds

01:04.334 --> 01:05.734
incredible,
but it doesn't make it

01:05.834 --> 01:06.818
any less true, all right?

01:06.918 --> 01:07.899
You're a healer, you do good.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.899
Now, either you have saved
too many lives

01:09.999 --> 01:11.192
or you're about to save a life

01:11.292 --> 01:13.192
that they don't
want you to save.

01:13.292 --> 01:13.899
"They"?

01:13.999 --> 01:16.109
Yeah, demons.
More specifically

01:16.209 --> 01:19.125
Shax, who is
the Source's assassin.

01:19.834 --> 01:20.899
Hold it. I get it.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.067
This is a practical joke, right?

01:23.167 --> 01:23.900
Is there a hidden

01:24.000 --> 01:25.692
camera here? My second wife

01:25.792 --> 01:26.899
put you up to this?

01:26.999 --> 01:28.567
Oh, it's
just like her.

01:28.667 --> 01:29.150
(<i>laughing</i>)

01:29.250 --> 01:31.150
PRUE:
O-o-okay, Dr.
Griffiths.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.150
Listen to me.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.292
This is anything but...

01:36.417 --> 01:36.899
What?

01:36.999 --> 01:38.899
Uh... I don't know.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.899
I just felt a chill.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.859
Phoebe?!
All right, all right!

01:42.959 --> 01:43.776
I'm coming!

01:43.876 --> 01:44.900
(<i>door slams open</i>)

01:45.000 --> 01:45.900
Phoebe!

01:46.000 --> 01:46.899
Phoebe!

01:46.999 --> 01:49.899
(<i>wind howling</i>)

01:49.999 --> 01:51.918
(<i>thunderous boom</i>)

01:55.792 --> 01:57.192
Dear God.

01:57.292 --> 01:58.709
No!

02:02.459 --> 02:03.751
Prue!

02:05.626 --> 02:06.250
Ah!

02:10.584 --> 02:12.359
What are you?

02:12.459 --> 02:14.899
The end.

02:14.999 --> 02:19.109
"Evil wind that blows
"that which forms below.

02:19.209 --> 02:20.150
No longer may you dwell.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.876
Death takes you
with this spell."

02:38.501 --> 02:39.899
Oh, God.

02:39.999 --> 02:41.125
Leo!

02:41.999 --> 02:43.375
Leo!

02:44.417 --> 02:46.542
Hurry, it's bad.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.626
(<i>moaning</i>)

03:03.417 --> 03:04.317
What happened?

03:04.417 --> 03:06.484
You guys almost died,
that's what happened.

03:06.584 --> 03:08.526
PIPER:
Yeah, well, what
else is new?

03:08.626 --> 03:09.317
Oh. Where's Shax?

03:09.417 --> 03:10.859
PIPER:
Well, I tried to use

03:10.959 --> 03:13.818
the vanquishing spell on him,

03:13.918 --> 03:15.317
but I think it just wounded him.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.275
He turned
into the wind.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.484
Well, maybe
the spell needs

03:17.584 --> 03:20.234
more than one witch
to have its full impact.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.859
(<i>groans</i>) Oh. Okay.

03:21.959 --> 03:22.287
Come on.

03:22.297 --> 03:24.317
PIPER:
Come on, come
on where?

03:24.417 --> 03:25.109
Let's go find him

03:25.209 --> 03:27.442
so we can finish him off
while he's still hurt.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.567
Look, you just stay here
with Griffiths, all right?

03:30.667 --> 03:31.900
If Shax comes back,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.567
say the spell to fend
him off. Right? Ow.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.876
Okay, come on.

03:46.751 --> 03:48.899
Maybe Phoebe hurt him
worse than she thought.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.567
No, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.067
He wouldn't leave without
getting what he came for.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.900
You really think he'd
attack us in broad daylight?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.899
Evil is usually
more insidious than that.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.899
Uh, okay.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.942
What?

04:02.042 --> 04:04.375
(<i>wind howling</i>)

04:09.209 --> 04:10.584
Blow this!

04:13.959 --> 04:15.899
Okay... is he dead?

04:15.999 --> 04:18.899
Well, we didn't
really say the spell.

04:18.999 --> 04:19.776
Well, maybe

04:19.875 --> 04:21.899
we don't have to.
We don't always.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.150
We're lucky
nobody saw us.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.899
All right, let's
just get back

04:24.999 --> 04:25.899
to Phoebe. Come on.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.150
Back to me.
Back to me.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.734
Back to me!

04:29.834 --> 04:31.942
Um... okay, um...

04:32.042 --> 04:34.317
I'm not exactly sure
what just happened,

04:34.417 --> 04:40.375
but whatever it was,
you saw it here... live.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.651
Thank you.

06:19.751 --> 06:20.370
Now you
understand

06:20.380 --> 06:22.025
why you have to
keep this a secret?

06:22.125 --> 06:23.899
Why you can't tell
anyone about us?

06:23.999 --> 06:27.083
About what
you saw today?

06:27.999 --> 06:28.859
If others knew,
we wouldn't

06:28.959 --> 06:30.651
be able to do
what we do any more.

06:30.751 --> 06:31.567
We wouldn't be able

06:31.667 --> 06:34.317
to help future innocents
like we helped you.

06:34.417 --> 06:35.899
No. No, I understand.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.359
I mean, except, I
don't understand

06:37.459 --> 06:41.999
everything.
Demons. Witches. The Source.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.876
So much for my being an atheist.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.709
Your secret is safe with me.

06:50.709 --> 06:51.651
Thank you.

06:51.751 --> 06:53.109
No, thank <i>you.</i>

06:53.209 --> 06:53.899
You saved my life.

06:53.999 --> 06:56.899
The least I can do
is protect yours.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.899
Okay,

06:57.999 --> 06:59.899
I'll walk you to the door.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.751
Okay.

07:02.125 --> 07:03.584
Bye.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.275
How'd it go?

07:06.375 --> 07:07.109
All right.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.692
We dodged
another bullet.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.067
Yeah, with him, maybe.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.899
What do you mean?
PRUE:
I don't know.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.692
I mean, something
still bothers me

07:13.792 --> 07:15.818
about the way
that we vanquished Shax.

07:15.918 --> 07:17.859
Like I'm not
so sure we really did.

07:17.959 --> 07:18.651
What do you mean?

07:18.751 --> 07:20.150
He screamed,
he went poof...

07:20.250 --> 07:21.317
just like they all do.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.776
Third demon
in a row,

07:22.876 --> 07:23.899
by the way, that
I vanquished

07:23.999 --> 07:25.899
with my new power,
but who's counting?

07:25.999 --> 07:26.899
PRUE:
Right, but if that's

07:26.999 --> 07:28.899
all that we needed,
then why was there

07:28.999 --> 07:30.401
a vanquishing
spell in the book?

07:30.501 --> 07:31.899
I mean, hasn't
that always meant

07:31.999 --> 07:33.899
that our individual
powers weren't enough?

07:33.999 --> 07:35.526
Except the book
was written by witches

07:35.626 --> 07:37.275
with less powers
than you guys have.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.192
They needed the spells.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.150
And plus, I think if
he was still alive,

07:40.250 --> 07:43.109
he probably would have
attacked again by now.

07:43.209 --> 07:43.942
Uh... you know, Leo,

07:44.042 --> 07:47.025
would you just check
to make sure, please?

07:47.125 --> 07:48.692
With the Elders?

07:48.792 --> 07:50.167
No problem.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.900
If you ask me, I think
you're being paranoid.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.899
We kicked Shax's ass. We bad!

07:56.999 --> 07:58.942
Yes, you're
probably right.

07:59.042 --> 08:00.234
Phoebe:
Then, um...

08:00.334 --> 08:04.734
I'm hoping you won't need me
around here for a while.

08:04.834 --> 08:05.899
I want to try

08:05.999 --> 08:08.899
a new potion on Cole,
one that'll reverse

08:08.999 --> 08:10.942
the spell that
turned him bad

08:11.042 --> 08:12.192
in the first place.

08:12.292 --> 08:12.651
Phoebe.

08:12.751 --> 08:14.899
I'm not looking for
your approval, Piper,

08:14.999 --> 08:15.567
just your support.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.234
PRUE:
Well, Phoebe,
it's sort of hard

08:17.334 --> 08:18.899
to give you support
when you're just

08:18.999 --> 08:20.609
setting yourself up
to get hurt again.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.317
Cole is good
inside. I know it,

08:23.417 --> 08:24.899
and if dark magic
did this to him,

08:24.999 --> 08:29.067
then how come white
magic can't save him?

08:29.167 --> 08:32.609
I can't just turn my
back. I have to try.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.025
What do you want us to do?

08:34.125 --> 08:37.775
I want you to use the
magic-to-magic spell

08:37.876 --> 08:39.609
to send me down there.

08:39.708 --> 08:40.859
I reworded it

08:40.958 --> 08:42.417
to make it work.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.899
Uh, Phoebe,
that's awfully dangerous.

08:45.999 --> 08:46.899
If something goes wrong,

08:46.999 --> 08:49.442
we won't be able to
contact each other.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.109
I'll be safe, I'll
be with Cole,

08:51.209 --> 08:55.025
and he'll bring me back,
so don't worry about that.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.234
PRUE:
You're banking a lot

08:56.334 --> 08:59.025
on that little potion
of yours, you know.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.275
No, I'm not.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.334
I'm banking on Cole.

09:23.125 --> 09:26.167
Cole... wake up.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.651
Phoebe.

09:32.751 --> 09:34.818
What are you
doing here?

09:34.918 --> 09:36.751
I came
to bring you back.

09:39.334 --> 09:40.999
(<i>gasps</i>)

Quiet!

09:55.125 --> 09:55.942
Close that damn door.

09:56.042 --> 09:58.983
Now, what we talk
about in this room

09:59.083 --> 10:01.609
stays in this room
until I say otherwise.

10:01.709 --> 10:04.083
All right? Go ahead.

10:06.292 --> 10:08.899
Seismologists believe
that this quiet neighborhood

is actually sitting
on top of a fault line.

Oh, my God.

10:19.209 --> 10:20.999
Back to me. Back to me!

10:22.751 --> 10:24.526
Has this hit
the network feed yet?

10:24.626 --> 10:25.818
No, but if we don't send it,

some idiot out there
who taped it will.

It could have been anything,

publicity stunt.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.567
Right, publicity stunt--
for what, NASA?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.192
And besides, why would
they pull a stunt?

we were there.

You don't know that-- maybe
they only pretended not to know.

10:53.459 --> 10:54.192
For all we know,

10:54.292 --> 10:55.609
this is just a hoax.
Yeah. And if it is,

10:55.709 --> 10:57.484
and we send it out
before we authenticate it,

10:57.584 --> 10:58.442
we're gonna look like fools.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.692
We can't put the genie
back in the bottle, Dave.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.401
200,000 viewers

11:02.501 --> 11:03.484
saw it live.

11:03.584 --> 11:05.542
What do you want to do?

11:11.375 --> 11:13.776
Go find out
who those women are.

11:13.876 --> 11:14.651
Fast.

11:14.751 --> 11:15.609
But be careful, okay?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.709
They may not want to be found.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.192
What did you expect
to find?

11:24.292 --> 11:26.192
I don't know.
Something, though.

11:26.292 --> 11:29.609
Well, demons don't usually
leave footprints, remember?

11:29.709 --> 11:30.401
No, but sometimes

11:30.501 --> 11:33.067
they leave a residue
when they've been vanquished,

11:33.167 --> 11:34.734
something otherwise
innocuous.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.234
Look, I just don't understand
how we could vanquish

11:37.334 --> 11:38.818
such a powerful demon
without a spell.

11:38.918 --> 11:42.899
Well, frankly I'm more worried
about Phoebe than Shax.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.359
We shouldn't have let her go.

11:44.459 --> 11:47.234
Phoebe can take care of herself,
Dr. Griffiths can't.

11:47.334 --> 11:47.942
Look, Piper,

11:48.042 --> 11:49.899
I've had a bad feeling
about this,

11:49.999 --> 11:50.899
and I've had one all day,

11:50.999 --> 11:52.899
and if there's one thing
I've learned

11:52.999 --> 11:54.192
since becoming a witch,

11:54.292 --> 11:56.359
is to trust those feelings.

11:56.459 --> 11:58.542
PRUE:
Hi.

12:00.999 --> 12:03.234
Come on, sweetie.

12:03.334 --> 12:05.999
Stay away from them.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.459
Hey.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.192
Sit.

12:17.292 --> 12:18.442
Morris.

12:18.542 --> 12:19.192
Captain.

12:19.292 --> 12:20.899
Looks like all those
freaky rumors about

12:20.999 --> 12:24.899
you and the Halliwells
might not have been
rumors after all.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.459
What do you mean?

12:30.999 --> 12:34.209
Oh, no.

12:38.667 --> 12:39.609
No, I understand.

12:39.709 --> 12:40.651
How long will he be in there?

12:40.751 --> 12:43.818
Okay, just have Dr. Griffiths
call me as soon as possible.

12:43.918 --> 12:44.899
All right, thanks. Bye.

12:44.999 --> 12:48.067
Okay, well, at least
Griffiths is in
surgery for now.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.067
No way Shax will attack him
in there.
Okay,

12:51.167 --> 12:51.942
but what do we do, then?

12:52.042 --> 12:53.567
We can't protect him
indefinitely.

12:53.667 --> 12:54.899
Well, if I'm right,
we won't have to.

12:54.999 --> 12:57.651
I mean, Shax will attack
sooner rather than later.

12:57.751 --> 12:58.359
We should go.

12:58.459 --> 13:01.899
No, w-we should wait, for Leo,
to see what he found out,

13:01.999 --> 13:03.234
especially with Phoebe gone.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.818
I mean, what if we need
the power of three?

13:05.918 --> 13:10.651
(<i>phone rings</i>)
Oh, maybe that's Griffiths.

13:10.751 --> 13:12.734
Hello.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.567
D... Darryl, just wait.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.899
Slow down, okay? What?

13:16.999 --> 13:18.692
Have you seen the TV yet today?

13:18.792 --> 13:19.692
It's all over it.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.234
What's all over it, Darryl?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.776
Just turn on the TV, okay?

13:22.876 --> 13:24.734
I told the captain
I would handle this,

13:24.834 --> 13:26.526
but I can't do it
if I'm off the wall.

13:26.626 --> 13:28.818
MAN (<i>over TV</i>):
...that being...

13:28.918 --> 13:29.359
Stand by.

13:29.459 --> 13:31.651
We're now going
to switch live
Oh, my God!

13:31.751 --> 13:33.609
to Elana Dominguez,
MORRIS: Prue? Prue?

13:33.709 --> 13:34.651
with another exclusive. Elana?

13:34.751 --> 13:40.234
Here we are approaching the home
of where they allegedly live.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.542
Oh!

13:42.999 --> 13:46.609
Prue, Piper and Phoebe
Halliwell.

13:46.709 --> 13:52.899
And you're gonna meet them live,
right here on KCSF.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.209
What are we gonna do?

14:02.999 --> 14:04.359
(<i>tires screech</i>)

14:04.459 --> 14:05.317
Look! Look! Look!

14:05.417 --> 14:06.401
Are you coming
to arrest them?

14:06.501 --> 14:08.317
Do you consider them dangerous?
No comment.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.401
Is the FBI involved?
I said no comment.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.609
Do you have any idea
who they are?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.942
WOMAN:
Hey. Hey, I can help--
I know who they are,

14:14.042 --> 14:14.900
and I know what they are.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.900
They're witches, just
like me, just like I am!

14:17.000 --> 14:19.025
Yeah, Prue, I'm at the door,
open it up, okay?

14:19.125 --> 14:20.899
Would you like to
make a statement?

14:20.999 --> 14:23.067
I said no comment!
Oh, Miss Halliwell...

14:23.167 --> 14:24.275
Back off!

14:24.375 --> 14:25.359
I've got...

14:25.459 --> 14:26.150
Isn't that illegal?

14:26.250 --> 14:27.609
Can't you do something
about that?

14:27.709 --> 14:31.109
Well, killing somebody
live on TV's pretty
illegal, too, you know.

14:31.209 --> 14:31.942
Okay, it wasn't...

14:32.042 --> 14:33.899
<i>somebody,</i> Darryl,
it was a demon,

14:33.999 --> 14:36.900
and we're pretty sure
we didn't kill him, anyway.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.317
You want to try
telling them that?

14:38.417 --> 14:39.567
Look, I've called
for backup,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.442
but that's not gonna
help for long.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.899
This thing's gonna
get ugly fast.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.776
We shouldn't have followed
Shax into the street.

14:45.876 --> 14:47.899
We didn't have a choice, Piper.
Didn't we?

14:47.999 --> 14:50.317
Sure, we could've let him
kill our innocent.

14:50.417 --> 14:51.899
That would've been better,

14:51.999 --> 14:53.584
you think?!

14:54.083 --> 14:54.900
All right, you know what?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.359
Let's not let this thing
get between us, okay?

14:57.459 --> 14:59.692
We have enough problems
as it is, please.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.442
(<i>sighs</i>):
More than you know.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.109
The captain wants me
to bring you in for questioning.

15:04.209 --> 15:05.484
PIPER:
Right, Darryl,

15:05.584 --> 15:07.359
and what do we tell him,
the truth?

15:07.459 --> 15:09.899
(<i>phone rings</i>)
What are you gonna tell them?

15:09.999 --> 15:11.109
(<i>heavy sigh</i>)

15:11.209 --> 15:12.734
Captain.

15:12.834 --> 15:13.900
You know,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.567
maybe when Phoebe's
done saving Cole,

15:16.667 --> 15:18.899
she can come back
and save us.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.859
PIPER:
Hello, Leo.

15:20.959 --> 15:22.526
Nice of you to orb in.
Where have you been?!

15:22.626 --> 15:24.899
Trying to figure out
how to get you out of this mess.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.899
It's pretty big news up there.
PRUE:
Well, in case

15:26.999 --> 15:30.150
you hadn't noticed, it's
pretty big news down here, too.

15:30.250 --> 15:30.942
Any suggestions?
No.

15:31.042 --> 15:32.776
They're still working on it.
PIPER:
Oh, well,

15:32.876 --> 15:35.734
then by all means,
tell them to take their time!

15:35.834 --> 15:37.567
They're not the ones
that screwed up.

15:37.667 --> 15:38.899
PIPER:
Excuse me, screwed up?

15:38.999 --> 15:40.484
We've been busting
our wiccan butts

15:40.584 --> 15:42.609
for three years
without getting caught.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.109
Don't we get credit for <i>that?</i>

15:44.209 --> 15:45.859
Piper, you've been exposed.

15:45.959 --> 15:46.983
If we can't fix
this, it could

15:47.083 --> 15:48.234
undermine all the good
that you've done

15:48.334 --> 15:50.025
and all the good that
you're still destined to do.

15:50.125 --> 15:51.899
PIPER:
Well, maybe this is our destiny.

15:51.999 --> 15:54.025
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.484
You don't believe that.

15:56.584 --> 15:57.401
Don't I?

15:57.501 --> 15:58.692
I don't.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.526
I mean, look,
this whole year

16:00.626 --> 16:02.734
has just been a series
of tests, right?

16:02.834 --> 16:03.899
To see what we're made of.

16:03.999 --> 16:06.192
Well, maybe this is
one more test.

16:06.292 --> 16:07.983
Which means we can't
give up, all right?

16:08.083 --> 16:08.900
So, while the Elders

16:09.000 --> 16:11.651
are figuring out
what we're suppose to do,

16:11.751 --> 16:13.609
we still have work to do, okay?

16:13.709 --> 16:14.692
Dr. Griffiths?
Yeah,

16:14.792 --> 16:16.899
if we don't catch him
before he gets out of surgery,

16:16.999 --> 16:18.859
Shax will-- unless
you know something we don't?

16:18.959 --> 16:21.776
No, you're right-- your powers
aren't enough to vanquish him.

16:21.876 --> 16:23.899
You'll need the three of you
to say the spell.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.651
Yeah, well,
we only have two of us.

16:26.751 --> 16:27.109
Don't ask,

16:27.209 --> 16:28.859
just orb us
to the hospital, okay?

16:28.959 --> 16:30.192
I can't.
The Elders won't let me.

16:30.292 --> 16:33.609
They don't want to risk
exposing whitelighters, too.

16:33.709 --> 16:34.150
Cowards!

16:34.250 --> 16:36.734
Fine, we'll just save him
without your guys' help.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.150
Let's go.
Whoa, Prue, Prue.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.899
Even if you <i>can</i> save
the innocent,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.150
that still doesn't
save yourselves.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.651
Yeah, I know that,
Darryl, but first things
first, all right?

16:43.751 --> 16:45.859
Try and buy us as much time
with your captain as you can.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.067
And you, why don't you
get back up there
and whitelight a fire

16:48.167 --> 16:51.417
underneath your bosses'
butts! Let's go.

16:51.918 --> 16:53.401
...whether or not
any arrests have...

16:53.501 --> 16:55.609
WOMAN:
Hey! I need to
talk to you!

16:55.709 --> 16:58.150
Miss Halliwell!

16:58.250 --> 16:59.692
WOMAN:
No, wait!
Don't leave!

16:59.792 --> 17:00.899
Don't leave!

17:00.999 --> 17:02.234
Miss Halliwell!

17:02.334 --> 17:03.859
Please take me!

17:03.959 --> 17:05.358
Come on, please
take me with you!

17:05.459 --> 17:08.999
Take me... Oh, man!

17:10.459 --> 17:11.858
(<i>people talking excitedly</i>)

17:11.959 --> 17:12.898
(<i>punch lands</i>)

17:12.999 --> 17:14.858
(<i>grunts</i>)

17:14.959 --> 17:15.898
(<i>groans</i>)

17:15.999 --> 17:17.898
You're not an easy
girl to dump.

17:17.999 --> 17:21.401
Yeah, well, I didn't risk
everything to come down here

17:21.501 --> 17:23.150
and not get what I came for.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.401
(<i>groans</i>)

17:24.501 --> 17:26.776
You can't have me, not anymore.

17:26.876 --> 17:29.859
I can if I reverse the spell
that took you away from me.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.942
(<i>laughs</i>):
We've already had
this conversation, Phoebe.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.484
Even if you could reverse it,

17:34.584 --> 17:36.567
it doesn't change
the fact that I...

17:36.667 --> 17:37.692
That you killed a witch.

17:37.792 --> 17:38.859
Yeah, I know Cole,

17:38.959 --> 17:40.983
but you didn't do it willingly,
and that's the difference.

17:41.083 --> 17:44.317
That's what gives you
a second chance;
that's what gives <i>us</i>

17:44.417 --> 17:46.083
a second chance.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.899
I already had
a second chance...

17:50.999 --> 17:52.899
and I blew it.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.401
Now, this...

17:54.501 --> 17:57.609
is your last chance.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.025
Do you understand?

17:59.125 --> 18:00.983
No more games.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.899
Go home.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.375
You can't save me.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.209
You want to bet?

18:13.167 --> 18:15.999
Pretty cool potion, huh?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.999
Let's get out of here.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.192
Where?

18:40.292 --> 18:41.899
What do you mean, where?

18:41.999 --> 18:43.818
Home, back to my place.

18:43.918 --> 18:45.651
You really think they're
just gonna let me go.

18:45.751 --> 18:48.900
They're... not gonna come
looking for me again?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.250
We'll fight them off.

18:51.751 --> 18:53.776
For how long,
indefinitely?

18:53.876 --> 18:55.609
Phoebe, we tried
it up there;

18:55.709 --> 18:57.667
it doesn't work for us.

18:58.626 --> 19:01.999
So where does that leave us?

19:04.792 --> 19:07.417
Right where we are.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.899
Yes, yes.

19:13.999 --> 19:15.317
Oh. Yes.

19:15.417 --> 19:17.275
Here he is now.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.359
This is Dr. Griffiths.

19:18.459 --> 19:20.567
Hi. He's still
after you. Come on.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.734
Wait...

19:21.834 --> 19:23.067
Come on.
Let's go.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.651
I don't have...

19:24.751 --> 19:26.567
I thought you said you
got rid of this thing.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.150
Yeah, well, we don't think
that anymore, okay?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.859
Where we
going?
Just...

19:30.959 --> 19:31.859
somewhere it's safe...

19:31.959 --> 19:33.899
I'm not cut
out for...
Get in the car!

19:33.999 --> 19:35.292
I swear...

19:56.751 --> 19:59.567
death takes you
with this spell."

19:59.667 --> 20:00.899
(<i>anguished yell</i>)

20:00.999 --> 20:03.983
(<i>people gasping</i>)

20:04.083 --> 20:06.275
Now, that was a vanquish.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.526
Whoo!

20:07.626 --> 20:09.025
Nice going!

20:09.125 --> 20:10.275
Uh-oh.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.567
Uh...

20:11.667 --> 20:13.899
PRUE/PIPER:
Oh...

20:13.999 --> 20:15.899
News at 11:00.

20:15.999 --> 20:18.250
Oh, that's bad.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.626
(<i>crowd clamoring</i>)

20:25.542 --> 20:29.125
(<i>screaming</i>)

20:30.999 --> 20:31.899
Step back!

20:31.999 --> 20:35.899
ALICE:
I'm one of you!

20:35.999 --> 20:38.150
Prue... Piper,

20:38.250 --> 20:39.900
I'm one of you!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.567
I'm the only one
who understands!

20:42.667 --> 20:43.899
I can help!

20:43.999 --> 20:47.442
Hey!

20:47.542 --> 20:49.899
Prue! Piper!

20:49.999 --> 20:52.150
Get those idiots
off the driveway.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.359
Get them back behind the tape!

20:54.459 --> 20:55.609
All right, what
I can't figure out

20:55.709 --> 20:57.859
is how they knew
that we were at the hospital.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.067
I mean,
they didn't follow us.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.751
The reporter probably lo-jacked
your car and followed you.

21:03.125 --> 21:03.537
Forget it.

21:03.547 --> 21:06.234
You know, I really hope Phoebe's
doing better down there

21:06.334 --> 21:07.234
than we are up here!

21:07.334 --> 21:09.983
Look at all these
interview requests
we're getting.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.859
Ted Koppel,
<i>Time</i> magazine,

21:11.959 --> 21:14.900
Jerry Springer...
<i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

21:15.000 --> 21:16.567
MORRIS:
Yeah, they probably
want you

21:16.667 --> 21:18.109
for the swimsuit edition.

21:18.209 --> 21:19.442
Uh... just kidding.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.692
PRUE:
You know what?
This is a nightmare.

21:22.792 --> 21:25.150
Where is Leo?

21:25.250 --> 21:26.859
Uh,

21:26.959 --> 21:28.359
Piper...

21:28.459 --> 21:29.567
okay...

21:29.667 --> 21:30.484
Is that who
I think it is?

21:30.584 --> 21:32.025
GRIFFITHS:
...and then one
of them said

21:32.125 --> 21:34.567
they needed a vanquishing
spell...

21:34.667 --> 21:35.287
PIPER:
Dr. Griffiths?

21:35.297 --> 21:38.150
She ran upstairs
to get some book.

21:38.250 --> 21:38.899
I don't know...

21:38.999 --> 21:40.899
some witch-type book, I guess.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.275
Something that told them
how to kill that demon.

21:43.375 --> 21:46.734
Oh, so much for
keeping our secret!

21:46.834 --> 21:47.651
Turn him off!

21:47.751 --> 21:50.275
Those sisters were always
a little strange

21:50.375 --> 21:51.359
if you ask me.

21:51.459 --> 21:54.900
I know, for a fact,
that Prue once cast a spell

21:55.000 --> 21:56.442
to make my boyfriend

21:56.542 --> 21:58.442
break up
with me.

21:58.542 --> 21:59.567
Evil.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.109
Okay, Susie Johnson
from tenth grade?

22:03.209 --> 22:04.192
They're interviewing her?

22:04.292 --> 22:05.899
PIPER:
I always wondered

22:05.999 --> 22:06.859
why they broke up.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.275
Not funny, not funny!

22:08.375 --> 22:11.983
Ooh... Leo...
Leo...

22:12.083 --> 22:14.692
Leo!

22:14.792 --> 22:16.501
Leo!

22:18.125 --> 22:19.401
Ooh... ah!

22:19.501 --> 22:20.442
All right.

22:20.542 --> 22:22.609
This thing has
to end now, okay?

22:22.709 --> 22:25.025
The media is turning it
into a freakin' circus!

22:25.125 --> 22:25.899
Now you know why the Elders

22:25.999 --> 22:28.067
have always been
highly concerned about exposure.

22:28.167 --> 22:29.776
Okey-dokey,
now we know!

22:29.876 --> 22:31.859
Do they have any solutions
or not?

22:31.959 --> 22:34.567
One,
but it's a long shot.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.484
You have to try
and contact Tempus.

22:37.584 --> 22:39.899
(<i>helicopter passing</i>)

22:39.999 --> 22:41.025
Uh, Tempus...

22:41.125 --> 22:42.359
Tempus the demon?

22:42.459 --> 22:43.109
He's the only one

22:43.209 --> 22:46.067
on either side who has
the power to manipulate time,

22:46.167 --> 22:48.401
to reset everything
before this all started.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.567
Okay, you're
definitely right.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.651
That-That qualifies
as a long shot.

22:51.751 --> 22:53.275
We vanquished him.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.899
No, you defeated him,
you didn't vanquish him.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.899
But that's not
the real problem.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.899
The real trick
is trying to contact him.

22:58.999 --> 23:02.025
He's an upper level demon
who's well insulated.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.734
And why would
he want to help us?

23:03.834 --> 23:05.150
I mean, we can't make
a move without

23:05.250 --> 23:07.567
the whole world
tuning in to watch.

23:07.667 --> 23:08.776
We're basically powerless.

23:08.876 --> 23:09.899
Why would he want

23:09.999 --> 23:10.983
to change that?

23:11.083 --> 23:12.167
(<i>shrieking</i>)

23:12.626 --> 23:15.150
Wow, cool, I made it!

23:15.250 --> 23:17.401
Who the hell are you?

23:17.501 --> 23:18.983
I'm Alice. Alice Hicks.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.192
I've been trying
to contact you.

23:21.292 --> 23:23.900
I want to join your coven.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.692
Are you nuts!

23:24.792 --> 23:26.709
This is our home.
Get out of here!

23:27.792 --> 23:28.983
Ow!DARRYL:
All units
stay back!

23:29.083 --> 23:31.626
All units stay back!

23:34.334 --> 23:37.109
Uh... you guys okay?

23:37.209 --> 23:38.899
Yeah, we got it, Darryl.

23:38.999 --> 23:40.317
All right,
this has to end now

23:40.417 --> 23:43.000
or our lives
are over!

23:44.083 --> 23:45.567
(<i>helicopter passing</i>)

23:45.667 --> 23:47.567
Here she comes. Closer.
What happened?

23:47.667 --> 23:48.484
What did they
do to you?

23:48.584 --> 23:49.609
Did they think
you were a demon?

23:49.709 --> 23:51.526
Did they think
you were a joke?

23:51.626 --> 23:53.899
They're mean witches.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.067
Tell us!
Tell us!

23:55.167 --> 23:57.459
Come on,
tell us.

23:58.626 --> 24:00.150
Okay, so how do
we contact Tempus?

24:00.250 --> 24:00.983
PRUE:
Through Cole.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.899
He's an upper level demon,
isn't he?

24:02.999 --> 24:04.651
Why would
he help us?

24:04.751 --> 24:05.899
Because helping us helps Phoebe.

24:05.999 --> 24:07.609
Are you allowed
to orb down there?

24:07.709 --> 24:09.317
Yes, but I won't
be able to find her

24:09.417 --> 24:10.526
until I'm down
there, I can't

24:10.626 --> 24:11.359
track her
from up here.

24:11.459 --> 24:13.751
All right, well,
then you'd better hurry.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.776
Okay, what's the matter?

24:16.876 --> 24:17.734
Well, once I'm down there,

24:17.834 --> 24:19.150
you won't be able
to contact me

24:19.250 --> 24:20.899
if you get any kind
of trouble.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.442
Honey, what
more trouble

24:23.542 --> 24:24.942
could we possibly
get into?

24:25.042 --> 24:26.692
Besides, once time
resets itself,

24:26.792 --> 24:28.401
then everything
should be fine.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.401
So go,
and be careful.

24:30.501 --> 24:32.334
Yeah, you, too.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.651
Okay, so what do you say?

24:38.751 --> 24:40.042
Oprah or Barbara?

24:41.709 --> 24:43.401
Barbara makes you cry.

24:43.501 --> 24:46.083
We go with Oprah.

24:48.292 --> 24:49.751
Phoebe?

24:52.834 --> 24:54.401
I have to get you out of here.

24:54.501 --> 24:56.899
You mean get us
out of here.

24:56.999 --> 24:59.567
Listen to me, this is serious.

24:59.667 --> 25:03.899
Something's happening,
something big.

25:03.999 --> 25:04.818
I...

25:04.918 --> 25:06.983
It's too dangerous for you here.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.484
Why? What's happening?

25:09.584 --> 25:10.412
I don't know,
but whatever it is,

25:10.422 --> 25:12.609
it's important enough
for the Source to have come.

25:12.709 --> 25:14.899
What?

25:14.999 --> 25:18.900
He's here? Now?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.751
Which is why you have to go.

25:25.334 --> 25:25.899
Leo.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.192
Are you out of your mind?

25:27.292 --> 25:28.025
What are
you doing?

25:28.125 --> 25:29.234
Trying to save my family.

25:29.334 --> 25:31.067
Prue and Piper
have been exposed, Phoebe.

25:31.167 --> 25:32.899
The whole world
knows you're witches.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.899
What? How?

25:34.999 --> 25:35.651
It doesn't
matter how.

25:35.751 --> 25:39.317
What matters is getting them out
of it, which requires your help.

25:39.417 --> 25:40.359
Come again?

25:40.459 --> 25:43.542
You have to get to Tempus, you
have to get him to reverse time.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.067
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

25:46.167 --> 25:47.899
There's no way.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.651
It's the only way
there is, Phoebe,

25:49.751 --> 25:50.651
but we have to move fast.

25:50.751 --> 25:54.317
I-I couldn't summon Tempus
even if I wanted to.

25:54.417 --> 25:56.734
I don't have
that kind of power.

25:56.834 --> 26:00.042
But you know somebody who does.

26:01.999 --> 26:02.776
Wait...

26:02.876 --> 26:04.192
(<i>chuckles</i>):
You want me to...

26:04.292 --> 26:06.899
ask the Source to help witches?

26:06.999 --> 26:09.401
Doesn't just
help witches.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.442
The demonic world
has been exposed, too, Cole.

26:11.542 --> 26:12.899
Why do you think he's here?

26:12.999 --> 26:14.067
Resetting time

26:14.167 --> 26:15.401
solves everybody's
problem.

26:15.501 --> 26:16.899
But make it your idea,
pitch it like

26:16.999 --> 26:19.167
you're doing it
to save him, not them.

26:20.042 --> 26:22.999
Whether that's why
you're doing it or not.

26:27.375 --> 26:30.999
This is suicide.

26:58.584 --> 27:01.417
(<i>inferno roaring</i>)

27:07.167 --> 27:08.484
I've heard the rumors.

27:08.584 --> 27:10.067
I beg you, are they true?

27:10.167 --> 27:11.401
Have we been exposed?

27:11.501 --> 27:13.192
What business is it of yours?

27:13.292 --> 27:15.359
I may have a solution.

27:15.459 --> 27:16.899
Tempus's powers...

27:16.999 --> 27:20.442
Are still weakened from when
he last turned back time.

27:20.542 --> 27:23.899
Doing so again
will destroy him.

27:23.999 --> 27:27.417
What other choice is there?

27:31.999 --> 27:32.899
Forgive me...

27:32.999 --> 27:34.526
For your
betrayal?

27:34.626 --> 27:36.042
Never.

27:37.626 --> 27:41.526
I know of your
struggles, Belthazor.

27:41.626 --> 27:42.859
Of your witch.

27:42.959 --> 27:45.818
I know that's why
you've come to me.

27:45.918 --> 27:48.899
I know everything
about you.

27:48.999 --> 27:51.567
Tempus will do
as you suggest,

27:51.667 --> 27:54.818
if your witch
crosses over.

27:54.918 --> 27:56.900
If your witch joins us.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.025
She'd never do that.

27:59.125 --> 28:02.818
Not even to save
one of her sister's lives?

28:02.918 --> 28:06.401
Has one of them been killed?

28:06.501 --> 28:08.999
Wait.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.942
(<i>shouting</i>)

28:17.042 --> 28:21.542
(<i>helicopter passing</i>)

28:23.999 --> 28:26.234
I don't know why we're
bothering to do this.

28:26.334 --> 28:29.526
In case time
doesn't reset itself.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.983
If time doesn't
reset itself,

28:31.083 --> 28:33.899
this table against that door
is not gonna help much.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.442
Yeah, well, then
we'd better start

28:35.542 --> 28:37.317
thinking about
what would, okay?

28:37.417 --> 28:38.317
Because if Leo doesn't succeed,

28:38.417 --> 28:40.899
we're gonna have to figure
out what we're gonna do.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.899
We're gonna do talk shows,
and book signings

28:42.999 --> 28:44.609
and movie deals,
and then be taken

28:44.709 --> 28:45.899
by the CIA and dissected.

28:45.999 --> 28:48.484
Yeah, how can you be
joking about this Piper?

28:48.584 --> 28:49.234
Who's joking?

28:49.334 --> 28:51.609
Well, I'm not.
All right?

28:51.709 --> 28:52.734
I'm scared.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.109
And you should be, too.

28:54.209 --> 28:56.234
Okay, our
lives, Piper,

28:56.334 --> 28:57.942
everything
that we've worked for,

28:58.042 --> 28:59.899
could be completely
destroyed with,

28:59.999 --> 29:01.442
with one stupid mistake.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.692
Our entire future,
our entire destiny

29:03.792 --> 29:05.899
could be wiped out
just like that!

29:05.999 --> 29:08.567
(<i>gunshot</i>)
(<i>gasps</i>)

29:08.667 --> 29:10.626
What was that?

29:14.959 --> 29:16.942
Piper... Piper!

29:17.042 --> 29:19.025
Piper.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.899
Oh...

29:20.999 --> 29:23.900
I killed the wicked witch.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.899
The wicked witch is dead!

29:25.999 --> 29:28.709
I killed the wicked witch!

29:40.501 --> 29:42.234
Oh, God.
Oh, God...

29:42.334 --> 29:44.609
I know, I know.
You're okay.

29:44.709 --> 29:46.942
You're okay.

29:47.042 --> 29:49.359
Leo!

29:49.459 --> 29:51.317
You're okay.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.899
Shh...

29:53.999 --> 29:55.692
Leo!

29:55.792 --> 29:59.751
Okay, we have to get you
to the hospital, come on.

30:00.918 --> 30:02.899
(<i>crowd clamoring</i>)

30:02.999 --> 30:05.275
Leo!

30:05.375 --> 30:07.567
(<i>shouting</i>)

30:07.667 --> 30:08.651
Leo!

30:08.751 --> 30:09.245
Miss Halliwell.

30:09.255 --> 30:10.692
Miss Halliwell, please.
What is going on?

30:10.792 --> 30:14.459
Miss Halliwell,
please.

30:15.709 --> 30:17.542
Leo!

30:19.626 --> 30:21.401
(<i>car engine starts</i>)

30:21.501 --> 30:24.109
Miss Halliwell,
what is going on?

30:24.209 --> 30:25.484
(<i>crowd shouting</i>)

30:25.584 --> 30:26.692
(<i>tires screech</i>)

30:26.792 --> 30:27.609
Move!
(<i>horn honking</i>)

30:27.709 --> 30:29.609
Miss Halliwell,
what is going on?
(<i>honking</i>)

30:29.709 --> 30:30.899
Move!

30:30.999 --> 30:32.567
Miss Halliwell,
where are you going?

30:32.667 --> 30:34.150
Miss Halliwell,
please...

30:34.250 --> 30:35.899
Move out of my way!

30:35.999 --> 30:38.275
I gotta get her
to the hospital! Move!

30:38.375 --> 30:39.484
What happened to your sister?

30:39.584 --> 30:41.192
Move out of my way!

30:41.292 --> 30:44.834
(<i>clamoring</i>)

30:46.999 --> 30:47.899
Move out
of the way!

30:47.999 --> 30:50.109
What's wrong with you people?!

30:50.209 --> 30:55.067
(<i>helicopter passing</i>)

30:55.167 --> 30:59.983
Leo!

31:00.083 --> 31:06.626
(<i>muffled shouting</i>)

31:12.999 --> 31:15.275
(<i>grunting</i>)

31:15.375 --> 31:19.983
(<i>panting</i>)

31:20.083 --> 31:21.292
(<i>yelling</i>)

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
(<i>yelling</i>)

31:32.250 --> 31:34.459
(<i>shouting</i>)

31:37.999 --> 31:40.501
(<i>tires screeching</i>)

31:50.667 --> 31:51.859
Okay, hang in there.

31:51.959 --> 31:52.900
Where's Dr. Griffiths?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.192
He should have been
here by now.

31:55.292 --> 31:56.275
How did this happen?

31:56.375 --> 31:58.899
Some idiot in front
of our house.

31:58.999 --> 31:59.859
What do we know?

31:59.959 --> 32:01.209
Pulse 70 and weak.

32:02.751 --> 32:04.150
GRIFFITHS
I need some numbers, people!

32:04.250 --> 32:06.025
On the count of three--

32:06.125 --> 32:08.417
one, two, three, go.

32:10.792 --> 32:11.859
(<i>gasping</i>)

32:11.959 --> 32:12.621
Get your kit prepared.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.192
GRIFFITHS:
Small entry wound

32:14.292 --> 32:15.401
upper right back.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.317
Larger exit wound abdomen.

32:18.417 --> 32:19.999
Lungs filling.

32:20.292 --> 32:21.899
Start an IV liter
of lactated IV ringers,

32:21.999 --> 32:22.899
Two units of O, stat.

32:22.999 --> 32:24.150
NURSE:
Right away.
Leo!

32:24.250 --> 32:26.109
GRIFFITHS:
Grab 40 cc's of adrenaline.

32:26.209 --> 32:27.792
NURSE:
Yes, sir.

32:28.626 --> 32:32.999
Leo, something must
have gone wrong...

32:37.250 --> 32:40.417
Hey, hey, don't you
dare die on me.

32:42.375 --> 32:43.900
Prue...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.234
I'm cold!

32:46.334 --> 32:48.275
I... I...

32:48.375 --> 32:49.942
I... I can't feel my legs.

32:50.042 --> 32:51.900
NURSE:
Pulse is dropping.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.609
Don't go.

32:54.709 --> 32:58.109
I...

32:58.209 --> 33:00.542
I love you.

33:01.542 --> 33:02.983
(<i>steady electronic tone</i>)

33:03.083 --> 33:04.751
Oh, God.

33:05.042 --> 33:06.192
NURSE:
Full arrest.

33:06.292 --> 33:07.250
Paddles!

33:12.042 --> 33:14.250
Gel.

33:14.918 --> 33:16.918
Clear.
Clear.

33:18.751 --> 33:20.067
(<i>steady tone</i>)
Recharge.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.899
Recharging.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.334
Clear.
Clear.

33:23.999 --> 33:27.818
(<i>steady electronic tone</i>)

33:27.918 --> 33:30.999
(<i>sobbing</i>)

33:34.000 --> 33:35.567
I'm sorry.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.334
No!

33:38.834 --> 33:40.899
No! No!

33:40.999 --> 33:43.918
No!

34:00.501 --> 34:02.999
Get out of here.

34:03.999 --> 34:04.899
Go!

34:04.999 --> 34:08.542
(<i>sobbing uncontrollably</i>)

34:14.417 --> 34:17.125
(<i>continues sobbing</i>)

34:25.083 --> 34:28.333
(<i>wheezing sobs</i>)

34:31.833 --> 34:35.998
(<i>Leo whispering</i>)

34:37.667 --> 34:38.899
Cole,

34:38.998 --> 34:40.900
where have you been?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.899
We've been worried.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.650
What's the matter?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.650
He knows...

34:47.751 --> 34:50.501
about you, about us.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.650
So, what does that mean?

34:53.751 --> 34:55.899
He's offering a deal.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.359
He'll get Tempus to reset time

34:58.459 --> 35:02.359
if you stay here.

35:02.459 --> 35:03.567
LEO:
What?

35:03.667 --> 35:04.983
Down here? He's crazy.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.234
Hardly.
Yeah, well,

35:06.334 --> 35:08.918
we're desperate
but not that desperate.

35:09.250 --> 35:14.375
Why would he think that I would
accept an offer like that?

35:17.375 --> 35:18.037
Because it's the only way

35:18.047 --> 35:20.876
to bring one of your sisters
back to life.

35:22.042 --> 35:23.709
What?

35:24.792 --> 35:27.000
It's a trick; he's lying.

35:28.209 --> 35:32.417
No... it's not.

35:43.959 --> 35:47.167
Hey, stop it right here. Here.

35:53.959 --> 35:56.083
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

35:57.167 --> 35:57.900
Just keep your hands

35:58.000 --> 36:00.999
where I can see them--
you won't get hurt.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.709
Easy.

36:24.999 --> 36:27.751
They killed her, Leo.

36:30.751 --> 36:35.292
They think we're the demons now.

36:36.501 --> 36:37.359
How...

36:37.459 --> 36:39.899
how could this be happening?

36:39.999 --> 36:41.899
I don't understand...

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
I'm so sorry.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.584
Can you make this right or not?

36:57.334 --> 36:59.584
Go!

37:06.751 --> 37:07.899
Don't worry,

37:07.999 --> 37:09.692
he's going to fix it.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.792
I promise you're
going to be fine.

37:27.209 --> 37:29.250
Piper...

37:38.375 --> 37:40.999
You don't have to do this.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.876
Yes, I do.

37:50.999 --> 37:53.651
So...

37:53.751 --> 37:56.859
will resetting time
affect us down here?

37:56.959 --> 37:59.899
No.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.999
Good.

38:02.542 --> 38:05.250
I only have one condition.

38:06.167 --> 38:08.234
You must warn Prue and Piper

38:08.334 --> 38:11.959
before the demonic
hit man attacks.

38:12.667 --> 38:15.000
Otherwise they're dead anyway.

38:20.792 --> 38:23.209
Agreed.

38:46.542 --> 38:50.692
Once I have reset time,
detain him.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.234
And then

38:53.334 --> 38:54.899
kill his witch.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.900
That way I won't have to worry
about Belthazor anymore.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.999
Or the Charmed Ones.

39:18.209 --> 39:20.501
(<i>beep</i>)

39:34.292 --> 39:37.776
It shall be done.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.999
(<i>thunder crashing</i>)

39:58.501 --> 40:01.025
PRUE:
Look, I know that this
all sounds incredible,

40:01.125 --> 40:03.899
but it doesn't make it
any less true, all right?

40:03.999 --> 40:04.899
You're a healer, you do good.

40:04.999 --> 40:06.776
Now, either you have saved
too many lives

40:06.876 --> 40:07.899
or you're about to save a life

40:07.999 --> 40:09.859
that they don't
want you to save.

40:09.959 --> 40:10.245
"They?"

40:10.255 --> 40:12.192
PRUE:
Yeah, demons.
More specifically

40:12.292 --> 40:14.109
Shax, who is the
Source's assassin.

40:14.209 --> 40:16.609
Hold it. I get it.

40:16.709 --> 40:18.818
This is a practical joke, right?

40:18.918 --> 40:19.651
Is there's

40:19.751 --> 40:20.401
a hidden camera here?

40:20.501 --> 40:22.234
My second wife
put you up to this?

40:22.334 --> 40:23.942
Oh, it's just
like her.

40:24.042 --> 40:24.692
(<i>laughing</i>)

40:24.792 --> 40:27.734
PRUE:
O-o-okay,
Dr. Griffiths,
listen to me.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.834
This is anything but...

40:31.501 --> 40:32.567
What?

40:32.667 --> 40:34.899
Uh... I don't know.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.899
I just felt a chill.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.359
Phoebe?

40:38.459 --> 40:41.542
Phoebe,
are you there?

40:42.584 --> 40:44.317
(<i>door slams open</i>)

40:44.417 --> 40:46.651
Phoebe, where are you?!

40:46.751 --> 40:49.125
(<i>wind howling</i>)

40:54.209 --> 40:55.734
Dear God!

40:55.834 --> 40:56.999
No!

41:04.542 --> 41:05.209
Ah!

41:12.999 --> 41:14.776
What are you?

41:14.876 --> 41:17.792
The end.

41:20.459 --> 41:23.667
(<i>glass shattering</i>)

41:24.667 --> 41:26.667
(<i>wind whistling</i>)

41:35.751 --> 41:37.709
(<i>thunderous boom</i>)

41:42.709 --> 41:44.751
(<i>glass shattering</i>)
