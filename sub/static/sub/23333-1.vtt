01:47.126 --> 01:49.001
Thank you.

01:54.793 --> 01:58.877
So, how does it feel
being back after how many years?

01:59.585 --> 02:01.502
A long time.

02:28.045 --> 02:30.671
I am Minister of Justice Buresova.

02:30.921 --> 02:33.963
- How do you do, Mrs. Horakova?
- How do you do?

02:34.046 --> 02:35.921
I'm glad to meet you.

02:37.296 --> 02:39.213
Please.

02:40.838 --> 02:42.714
Can I see them first?

02:45.089 --> 02:49.006
We're hoping to hand them to you
in front of the cameras.

02:49.089 --> 02:51.547
A symbolic gesture, if you will.

02:58.673 --> 03:00.548
Thank you.

03:02.507 --> 03:04.882
A bit a late delivery, isn't it?

03:07.508 --> 03:09.424
What should I tell them?

03:10.841 --> 03:14.799
I'm sorry, but I need to read it first.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.675
<i>I have recently read somewhere</i>

03:28.509 --> 03:32.676
<i>that a letter is like a ray of light
from a distant star.</i>

03:33.760 --> 03:37.718
<i>Its light comes to us and shines on us,</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:43.927
<i>it shows us the way in the darkness
even though the source is often long gone</i>

03:44.469 --> 03:46.761
<i>and it doesn't exist anymore.</i>

03:48.594 --> 03:53.177
<i>I will be embracing you
and kissing you with my words</i>

03:53.886 --> 03:58.512
<i>even though the hand
that has written them will be long gone.</i>

04:00.512 --> 04:02.928
<i>My only little girl Jana,</i>

04:04.553 --> 04:07.471
<i>God blessed my life as a woman with you.</i>

04:08.429 --> 04:13.054
<i>Apart from your father's magic love,</i>

04:14.513 --> 04:18.221
<i>you were the greatest gift
I received from fate.</i>

04:53.807 --> 04:57.558
The President
is expecting you, Mrs. Horakova.

04:59.225 --> 05:04.142
- He's actually seeing me, Bohu.
- Yes and the little part of me.

05:11.601 --> 05:13.768
He was interested in my work.

05:14.226 --> 05:18.394
He was interested in my thoughts
about the women's movement.

05:18.477 --> 05:21.144
So he wants you in politics.

05:40.395 --> 05:42.271
Hitler

05:43.229 --> 05:45.104
deranged, twisted.

05:48.729 --> 05:50.479
Twisted.

05:50.646 --> 05:52.521
Deranged.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.272
Hitler torted

05:56.980 --> 05:58.813
Distort twisted.

05:58.897 --> 06:00.688
Hitler's

06:01.272 --> 06:03.147
Distorted?

06:07.231 --> 06:12.189
Our union with Germany
is a perfect example of success.

06:13.398 --> 06:15.273
- Success?
- Yeah.

06:15.606 --> 06:19.399
It is a downright horrible example.

06:20.274 --> 06:22.149
It is not a union.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.315
It is an occupation!

06:24.982 --> 06:26.399
Hysterical woman.

06:26.482 --> 06:30.191
Is every woman with an opinion
hysterical to you?

06:30.400 --> 06:34.275
Czechoslovakia is hardly
an interest to anyone.

06:34.358 --> 06:38.858
Czechoslovakian economy
is one of the largest in the world

06:38.941 --> 06:43.484
and I am sure Herr Hitler is preparing to
occupy us. For that very reason.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.442
Jew!

06:46.984 --> 06:49.901
Protestant as if it matters.

06:51.192 --> 06:53.734
I think it's time for us to go.

06:55.568 --> 06:57.443
Yes.

07:03.318 --> 07:05.943
At which point
would any of you say, "Enough!?"

07:06.028 --> 07:10.778
Must Hitler reach Paris or London
for you to take threat seriously?

07:18.529 --> 07:20.404
Gentlemen

07:31.863 --> 07:34.780
France and Britain
are throwing us to the wolves.

07:34.863 --> 07:37.405
They have only concerned
about their own interests.

07:37.488 --> 07:41.530
And they don't realize
they're simply sheep of a different flock.

07:43.614 --> 07:46.447
The wolf never stops eating.

07:50.822 --> 07:52.697
Is anyone home?

08:07.199 --> 08:09.908
- Boo!
- I had no idea you were there.

08:18.075 --> 08:20.534
I have something for you

08:21.825 --> 08:25.367
from London and Paris.

08:30.368 --> 08:32.243
Help, help.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.618
It was pretty stiff.

08:43.577 --> 08:45.452
Try it on.

08:49.327 --> 08:51.202
It's beautiful.

08:56.287 --> 08:59.662
These trips
are getting longer and longer.

09:00.328 --> 09:02.745
I've always wanted to go to Paris.

09:02.828 --> 09:06.663
- What if a piece of Paris came to you?
- Thank you.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.829
Pepik will take you one day.

09:09.579 --> 09:11.579
Just as your wife took you?

09:16.454 --> 09:18.830
Come on. Help me in the kitchen.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.289
How was the trip?

09:28.622 --> 09:32.331
Well, they were
as agreeable as my own daughter.

09:33.248 --> 09:35.998
It will get better with Jana.

09:38.373 --> 09:42.374
With the others, I am not so sure.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.209
This is a good place.

10:13.418 --> 10:15.001
When?

10:15.168 --> 10:17.043
As soon as we can.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.960
Bohu, I want to do it.

10:21.835 --> 10:25.669
A list of those
willing to help with the resistance.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.502
Of course.

10:28.585 --> 10:30.461
I will carry it.

10:31.961 --> 10:34.295
Are you sure senator Plaminkova?

10:36.003 --> 10:39.003
This was not a good idea.
You have a family.

10:39.086 --> 10:41.086
- No.
- I should do it with myself.

10:41.170 --> 10:46.629
No, no, no. Because we are a family,
they are much less likely to search us.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.587
Are you sure about this?

10:48.712 --> 10:50.879
Don't worry, we will be fine.

10:51.629 --> 10:53.504
How do you know?

11:09.381 --> 11:11.298
I should carry the list.

11:14.464 --> 11:16.339
Why?

11:19.507 --> 11:23.882
If anything happens,
they are not likely search a woman.

11:25.465 --> 11:28.090
Everyone's name is on little list,

11:29.340 --> 11:31.216
the whole resistance.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.383
I will get rid of it quickly.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.343
Jana.

12:18.345 --> 12:20.262
Family Horak?

12:36.763 --> 12:38.805
Mrs. Horakova?

12:39.263 --> 12:41.138
Yes.

12:47.889 --> 12:52.181
For the love
of God, it's just cough candy!

12:52.264 --> 12:54.557
Too much candy is bad for her teeth.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.515
Enough!

13:07.558 --> 13:11.933
Now when you get home
be sure to share some with Aunt Vera.

13:12.183 --> 13:14.058
You understand?

13:22.767 --> 13:26.059
We are taking you in for questioning.

13:26.142 --> 13:29.225
Where are you taking him?

13:44.227 --> 13:46.102
Come and eat, Jana.

13:54.895 --> 13:56.562
How long?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.103
Pappa how am I supposed to know?

14:00.895 --> 14:04.312
- They refused to say.
- I cannot believe this.

14:04.395 --> 14:07.396
I told her it was dangerous and not to go.

14:10.021 --> 14:12.646
Not now, Jana, you'll spoil your ape

14:19.397 --> 14:21.939
- How could she?
- Not now.

14:22.730 --> 14:24.897
I will clean the living room.

14:56.650 --> 14:58.525
You were very brave.

15:02.483 --> 15:05.192
They'll be home soon. I'm sure of it.

15:35.695 --> 15:37.570
Get out!

15:42.071 --> 15:44.279
Out. Over here.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.196
- Faster.
- Hana Kaufmann!

15:50.529 --> 15:52.612
Come here.

15:56.363 --> 15:58.738
You are the transport from Pankrac prison?

15:58.822 --> 16:00.572
- Yes.
- When were you imprisoned?

16:00.655 --> 16:03.447
- Two years ago.
- What year?

16:04.072 --> 16:05.947
1940.

16:06.656 --> 16:09.364
- Name?
- Milada Horakova.

16:11.239 --> 16:15.489
- It says here you are a doctor.
- Of Jurisprudence.

16:16.073 --> 16:17.948
Good.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.615
You will work in a medical room.

16:52.701 --> 16:55.535
I never thought I would see you again.

16:55.910 --> 16:58.993
Milada. What's the latest from outside?

16:59.785 --> 17:01.660
I have no idea.

17:02.035 --> 17:06.203
I was in prison for two years.
I'm lucky to even be here.

17:07.786 --> 17:11.868
I am waiting a new trial.
They sentenced me to death.

17:12.411 --> 17:15.743
- What?
- But I'm waiting a new trial.

17:22.244 --> 17:25.954
I should have never
let you take that list ever.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.705
They never found it.

17:37.496 --> 17:39.371
Why did they arrest you?

17:41.246 --> 17:43.122
Because they could.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.372
You will be released tomorrow.

17:46.581 --> 17:48.206
But is she well enough?

17:48.289 --> 17:50.414
She will be fine for transport.

17:50.497 --> 17:52.372
Transport?

17:53.664 --> 17:55.748
You ask too many questions.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.959
- Did you like it?
- Yes, I did.

18:25.334 --> 18:28.875
- Do up the last button.
- Oh, you sound like mom.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.085
Someone needs to.

18:32.710 --> 18:37.126
Tell her I have grown a whole bunch
for her for when she comes back.

18:37.210 --> 18:39.085
I will.

18:41.335 --> 18:43.252
We have to rush to a train.

18:45.586 --> 18:47.419
Bye.

19:08.963 --> 19:10.838
Sweetheart!

19:42.257 --> 19:44.132
From your husband.

20:08.926 --> 20:10.426
<i>I heard the few days ago</i>

20:10.509 --> 20:14.759
<i>that they transferred you
on the other side of our camp.</i>

20:14.926 --> 20:17.718
<i>I hope you will receive my message</i>

20:17.801 --> 20:21.344
<i>and this ring
that I made out of a bread for you.</i>

20:22.469 --> 20:25.219
<i>I love you. Bohu.</i>

21:31.100 --> 21:32.808
Transport!

21:33.391 --> 21:34.891
Faster.

22:28.104 --> 22:30.396
That is factually incorrect.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.313
I was in charge of
organising social welfare.

22:48.856 --> 22:52.106
I agree. However, such activity
can be hardly considered a conspiracy.

22:52.189 --> 22:58.148
And may I remind you that the prosecution
failed to provide any evidence.

23:09.191 --> 23:14.191
I commute
your death sentence to eight years

23:14.274 --> 23:16.774
to be served in Aichach.

23:18.984 --> 23:23.525
- Your love will carry me through.
- You are with me always.

24:01.778 --> 24:03.653
Miladka.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.946
Jana!

24:09.196 --> 24:11.071
Mamma!

24:32.531 --> 24:34.406
Bohu?

24:34.865 --> 24:36.906
He is here.

24:55.658 --> 24:58.200
The doctor will be here tomorrow.

25:07.368 --> 25:09.243
Bohu

25:29.160 --> 25:31.036
- Mamma?
- What is it?

25:31.703 --> 25:33.578
Is Daddy going to die?

25:36.495 --> 25:39.411
We will to pray for him,
and he will heal.

25:39.495 --> 25:41.661
Why is he sick and you are not?

25:46.496 --> 25:50.662
Sometimes it's hard to explain things.

25:50.746 --> 25:52.912
But he is sick because of you.

25:54.122 --> 25:55.997
Why would you say that?

25:57.663 --> 26:00.205
They arrested him because of you.

26:00.830 --> 26:02.455
Who told you that?

26:02.538 --> 26:04.413
Auntie.

26:09.498 --> 26:12.206
One day, I will explain everything.

26:13.248 --> 26:15.123
But not tonight.

26:19.332 --> 26:21.207
Here.

26:25.915 --> 26:29.749
Your father made this for me in the camp.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.250
Now try to rest.

27:06.211 --> 27:09.544
She has grown up so much.

27:13.211 --> 27:15.169
Thank you.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.504
You have done a great deal for my family.

27:19.129 --> 27:21.004
Jana is brave.

27:21.379 --> 27:25.754
She could have ended up
in a concentration camp with you.

27:26.254 --> 27:28.879
But she didn't, right?

27:48.464 --> 27:50.339
Jana made the cake.

28:14.674 --> 28:16.549
Taste very good.

28:45.011 --> 28:46.886
She's very confused.

28:55.178 --> 28:58.387
They arrested us because of me?

29:01.553 --> 29:03.720
Why would you say that to her?

29:04.845 --> 29:06.763
I told you it was not safe!

29:12.763 --> 29:18.347
Had everyone stood by, we would be
still living in the Third Reich.

29:19.222 --> 29:21.055
OK.

29:21.972 --> 29:23.764
Let's eat the cake.

29:36.598 --> 29:38.390
It's really good.

29:51.516 --> 29:53.391
What if he dies?

30:06.601 --> 30:08.393
We have to hope.

30:18.769 --> 30:21.727
All these people we knew

30:23.352 --> 30:25.269
are gone.

30:26.602 --> 30:28.477
I don't understand

30:36.145 --> 30:38.020
I don't know.

30:40.061 --> 30:42.896
But I am glad that you came back.

30:48.854 --> 30:53.229
Sometimes we find out later
why things happen as they do.

31:02.938 --> 31:04.813
I am sorry.

31:06.231 --> 31:09.314
I shouldn't have told Jana those things.

31:10.023 --> 31:11.898
I was wrong.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.026
When you are better,

31:44.067 --> 31:46.151
we will move to the country,

31:47.109 --> 31:48.984
build the house.

31:57.943 --> 31:59.818
Sorry.

32:13.319 --> 32:15.778
I'm... I'm thirsty.

32:33.821 --> 32:37.780
Our people do appreciate very highly

32:37.863 --> 32:42.864
the presence of the American Army
on Czechoslovak's soil

32:43.531 --> 32:47.447
and will strengthen
in the future this friendship

32:47.947 --> 32:53.822
which was so happily established
with a great American democracy

32:54.532 --> 32:57.782
through the benefits of our peace.

33:01.907 --> 33:03.782
This is it.

33:06.949 --> 33:09.158
I will miss having you home.

33:11.241 --> 33:13.949
You will enjoy your space with Bohu.

33:14.908 --> 33:19.159
And it's time me and Pepik
started on our own.

33:53.911 --> 33:55.787
So it's true!

33:57.745 --> 33:59.912
- Welcome back.
- You look well.

33:59.995 --> 34:01.870
You lie even better.

34:02.995 --> 34:05.120
Same office, same desk.

34:05.995 --> 34:08.413
Milada, we need you.

34:09.246 --> 34:12.788
My family needs me.
They went through enough.

34:13.413 --> 34:16.621
You know there's no "they"
if the communists gain control.

34:16.704 --> 34:18.580
That's a big "if".

34:18.914 --> 34:21.289
The President asked about you.

34:24.789 --> 34:26.664
How is Bohuslav?

34:28.330 --> 34:30.790
- He's doing well.
- It's great.

34:31.623 --> 34:34.165
- How was Jan?
- He is still the foreign minister.

34:34.248 --> 34:36.415
Maybe president one day.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.456
He lacks the fortitude
of his father to become one.

34:40.665 --> 34:43.873
I prefer to be direct these days.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.206
Why are you here?

34:47.666 --> 34:52.581
We all would be better off if we had
more people like you on our side.

34:53.456 --> 34:57.000
Your flattery won't get you much,
I am afraid.

34:57.208 --> 35:00.000
- Milada.
- Lida.

35:00.583 --> 35:03.125
- It is so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

35:08.626 --> 35:11.751
MILADA HORAKOVA RECEIVES
LEGION OF HONOR IN FRANCE

35:16.459 --> 35:18.085
<i>The Legion of Honor</i>

35:18.169 --> 35:22.294
<i>was awarded to Milada Horakova
by general de Gaulle.</i>

35:27.585 --> 35:29.669
What sorts of concessions?

35:30.045 --> 35:35.211
Military cooperation,
sharing of the Carpathian-Russia region.

35:35.795 --> 35:37.711
Sharing?

35:37.878 --> 35:40.253
The communists are growing stronger.

35:40.336 --> 35:44.587
People are feeling vulnerable,
we need to form a united front.

35:44.671 --> 35:50.587
Then let's unite in calling things exactly
what they are. Coercion and annexation.

35:51.212 --> 35:53.046
Precisely.

35:53.129 --> 35:56.505
That is why we need
your run for Parliament.

36:02.422 --> 36:06.881
Many politicians oppose
what you call equal protection.

36:07.006 --> 36:12.589
They say it is but a simple feminist
ideology, a sort of special privilege.

36:12.673 --> 36:18.132
That is because most politicians
are men governing only for other men.

36:18.549 --> 36:21.674
These need a signature
from the mayor's office.

36:21.757 --> 36:25.299
Are you considering
running for Parliament?

36:28.049 --> 36:29.924
Yes.

36:30.133 --> 36:32.008
Yes.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.383
And why now?

36:36.883 --> 36:38.758
Well

36:44.426 --> 36:46.301
When I was a little girl,

36:47.801 --> 36:52.092
I had a brother and a sister
who died from Scarlet fever.

36:54.552 --> 36:56.427
I had no power to help.

36:58.802 --> 37:04.093
As a member of Parliament
I can help all my brothers and sisters.

37:08.053 --> 37:09.928
Yeah.

37:11.261 --> 37:13.219
- When are you coming back?
- In three days.

37:13.303 --> 37:16.136
- Thank you for your time.
- I'm sorry.

37:16.261 --> 37:19.054
I am a big admirer of your work.

37:19.887 --> 37:24.262
I am divorced and my husband
refuses to help financially.

37:24.345 --> 37:30.221
If only someone were in a more influential
position to promote the laws you advocate.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.513
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

37:34.180 --> 37:35.680
Sorry.

37:35.763 --> 37:37.513
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:37.596 --> 37:42.222
Congratulations. I heard Initiative 99
is progressing through the legislature.

37:42.306 --> 37:46.972
Although I'm not sure it's going to be
popular with the Right Wing.

37:47.056 --> 37:52.306
The Right Wing will appreciate
their own pensions when they retire.

37:52.472 --> 37:55.307
- Sorry, I must go.
- You will be fine.

37:55.598 --> 37:57.973
I'm coming, late, but coming.

37:58.390 --> 38:02.932
This law will guarantee
that all survivors of the war,

38:03.807 --> 38:06.224
widows, orphans,

38:06.974 --> 38:09.433
and our wounded heroes,

38:09.933 --> 38:14.391
will never have to suffer
the existential insecurities,

38:14.849 --> 38:17.808
once they rejoin society.

38:38.685 --> 38:42.394
- Impressive first showing as an MP.
- Thank you.

38:42.727 --> 38:44.602
Comrade Horakova.

38:45.144 --> 38:48.561
Ah, Prime Minister Gottwald,
congratulations.

38:48.644 --> 38:50.644
And Mrs. Horakova. Still.

38:51.561 --> 38:53.644
Quite an impassioned plea.

38:53.977 --> 38:58.103
One that I will make certain
my fellow party members hear.

38:58.187 --> 39:02.103
We communists
have a lot of the same values.

39:02.353 --> 39:05.937
Isn't it reassuring, then,
we can share our common goals

39:06.021 --> 39:09.729
while maintaining
our unique party perspectives.

39:09.813 --> 39:12.313
Now if you will excuse me.

39:25.022 --> 39:27.189
Don't worry. It will be fine.

40:02.192 --> 40:05.525
- Hello.
- I will speak to you later then.

40:06.484 --> 40:08.859
Mrs. Horakova? Anezka Spurna.

40:09.443 --> 40:12.359
I just joined
the Council of Czechoslovak Women.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.443
Of course, yes. Pleasure.

40:14.859 --> 40:19.277
I want to continue the work
Senator Plaminkova started.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.819
Do you know what happened to her?

40:23.902 --> 40:27.444
Yes. There isn't a day
I don't think about her.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.445
Yes, yes, she was a great woman.

40:32.820 --> 40:36.153
Yes, well I look forward to work with you
at the Women's council.

40:36.236 --> 40:40.778
Isn't it just lovely
to return some sense of normalcy

40:41.028 --> 40:43.571
after the horrors we've all seen.

40:44.612 --> 40:47.904
Some of us, of course, more than others.

40:49.987 --> 40:54.530
How fortunate we all are
that the Soviets liberated us.

40:54.697 --> 40:59.613
Actually, our camp was freed
by American soldiers, not Soviet.

41:00.822 --> 41:05.488
Well, it's a shame, the Americans
weren't able to come as far as Prague.

41:05.572 --> 41:09.489
They had an agreement
to liberate Prague together

41:09.698 --> 41:12.323
but Stalin barged in days earlier.

41:13.156 --> 41:18.199
Then we should applaud
our true liberators' eagerness.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.865
- It was lovely to meet you finally.
- You as far.

41:34.283 --> 41:38.200
She had the nerve to try
to recruit me, right there.

41:38.658 --> 41:40.533
Such propaganda.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.992
She is only one person.

41:45.076 --> 41:50.992
But it is not, there are many and they
are going especially for the young ones.

41:52.367 --> 41:54.285
Alois was right.

41:54.660 --> 41:58.077
Those who want democracy
need all the help they can get.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.618
Why does it always have to be you?

42:17.369 --> 42:22.495
You have always supported me,
I cannot do this without you.

42:25.412 --> 42:28.704
You know I will support you
as long as I can.

42:44.581 --> 42:46.831
I'll not put us in danger.

42:47.914 --> 42:49.789
I promise.

43:45.836 --> 43:49.502
How did we go from
wanting them out of our country

43:50.336 --> 43:52.502
to seeking asylum in theirs?

43:56.003 --> 43:57.878
Are people blind?

43:59.128 --> 44:03.253
People are told what they want to hear.
And so they will believe it.

44:03.378 --> 44:07.754
And they will continue to believe it
until it is too late.

44:40.298 --> 44:43.007
So that's Gottwald keeping us safe.

44:44.549 --> 44:48.007
- From what?
- From our freedom, apparently.

44:52.299 --> 44:54.175
I can and I will speak up.

44:54.383 --> 44:56.925
I am still a Member of Parliament.

45:01.175 --> 45:03.133
If it doesn't work?

45:04.425 --> 45:07.343
Then we will find
other ways to voice our dissent.

45:17.009 --> 45:20.469
I am returning
from the presidential castle

45:20.844 --> 45:27.469
where the President has accepted the
resignation of the democratic ministers.

45:27.677 --> 45:33.428
Today, we Communists celebrate this,
the Victorious February!

45:48.596 --> 45:50.471
What is it?

45:59.930 --> 46:01.805
Anezka

46:03.680 --> 46:05.555
Why are you here?

46:07.098 --> 46:13.473
Surely it would be easier for us all
to unite with one voice.

46:14.889 --> 46:16.806
It's not too late for you.

46:16.889 --> 46:22.807
This attempt of Communist scheme
to unite, as you say, with one voice,

46:23.474 --> 46:26.765
seems to have created a deafening silence.

46:28.932 --> 46:32.016
What you call a deafening silence,

46:33.058 --> 46:36.266
I believe is actually the sound of peace.

46:37.766 --> 46:41.850
But people like you insist on disrupting

46:41.975 --> 46:45.517
that tranquility with your falsehoods,

46:46.642 --> 46:50.184
and I cannot
for the life of me understand why.

46:51.392 --> 46:55.727
If you do not
and will not support Communism,

46:56.477 --> 46:59.018
then you are a threat to this country.

46:59.102 --> 47:01.810
And this is what you call democracy.

47:03.060 --> 47:06.519
The choice remains yours, of course.

47:06.811 --> 47:10.186
But if I don't oblige

47:11.061 --> 47:13.603
then there will be consequences.

47:14.269 --> 47:16.144
Am I right?

47:20.020 --> 47:22.687
You have a wonderful family.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.729
You should think of them.

47:29.020 --> 47:31.438
It is time for you to go.

47:50.397 --> 47:53.022
It is no longer safe, I know.

47:55.357 --> 47:57.232
See you in the morning.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.315
I'll be ready.

48:53.152 --> 48:55.028
What?

48:56.695 --> 48:58.570
What is wrong?

49:04.070 --> 49:08.488
The Communist...
it is the Nazis all over again.

49:12.446 --> 49:14.321
What do we do?

49:20.489 --> 49:22.364
How about just leaving?

49:35.615 --> 49:37.781
I am considering resigning.

49:39.323 --> 49:41.198
Good.

49:41.865 --> 49:43.741
Resign, and then we go.

49:46.116 --> 49:49.032
We are giving up our mandates to fight.

49:50.157 --> 49:53.782
What sort of fight
it would be if I run away?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.575
Fight for Jana.

49:56.992 --> 49:58.867
For once, put her first.

50:02.158 --> 50:04.033
I am.

50:05.867 --> 50:07.743
But I want to believe

50:09.368 --> 50:11.451
that evil will be punished.

50:13.409 --> 50:18.785
I want to force myself to believe
that the world will be as it should be.

50:21.202 --> 50:24.994
But if we are not free,

50:26.077 --> 50:27.952
then Jana is not free

50:29.702 --> 50:32.411
and I cannot bear the thought of it.

50:44.454 --> 50:47.454
He was to leave for London this morning.

50:52.079 --> 50:54.163
I spoke to him right before.

50:57.830 --> 50:59.705
Be careful.

51:57.835 --> 51:59.668
Who did it?

52:03.127 --> 52:05.543
Russians most likely.

52:06.503 --> 52:09.378
Do we have proof? Some evidence?

52:11.419 --> 52:15.961
Everything was cleaned up
by the time the police showed up.

52:24.254 --> 52:26.962
They say he jumped from that window?

52:28.045 --> 52:31.005
No. From that window.

52:36.171 --> 52:38.046
And yet he landed here.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.755
Yes.

52:43.756 --> 52:46.131
There's a reason for me to stay.

52:46.839 --> 52:49.922
There are still people in need
from social services.

52:50.006 --> 52:52.547
I can help them get funds, documents.

52:52.672 --> 52:54.715
It's a lost battle, Milada.

52:58.715 --> 53:01.007
You should know when to leave.

53:04.340 --> 53:06.216
No.

53:07.174 --> 53:12.549
Tell whomever needs to escape the country
to come to my office and say they are

53:12.633 --> 53:14.508
they are case 45.

53:15.174 --> 53:20.425
If they don't hesitate to kill
the foreign minister of sovereign nation,

53:22.217 --> 53:24.092
they will go further.

53:38.426 --> 53:40.301
Case 45.

53:47.427 --> 53:49.302
Our democracy

53:50.302 --> 53:54.553
was a sacred institution to be cherished,

53:55.553 --> 53:57.428
protected.

53:57.762 --> 54:00.595
I fear we no longer have those values.

54:01.845 --> 54:05.803
And thus with the heaviest of heart

54:07.471 --> 54:09.346
I hereby resign

54:10.679 --> 54:12.554
in protest.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.722
So, when are you going to arrest me?

54:30.098 --> 54:31.973
Now?

54:36.306 --> 54:38.181
So what do you suggest?

54:39.223 --> 54:43.849
She is still popular with the public.
We need her on our side.

54:44.516 --> 54:46.432
I have tried everything.

54:47.349 --> 54:49.224
Try harder.

55:16.934 --> 55:19.477
I think it is time to leave Prague.

55:26.102 --> 55:27.977
Come in.

55:31.353 --> 55:34.145
I am case number 45.

55:34.228 --> 55:36.103
Right.

55:37.978 --> 55:39.853
Lida

55:40.186 --> 55:42.354
This needs to go downstairs.

55:46.896 --> 55:48.771
Please, come in.

55:52.687 --> 55:54.563
When are you crossing?

55:54.813 --> 55:56.688
Hopefully by Friday.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.730
Thank you.

56:00.688 --> 56:02.605
Thank you for everything.

56:02.688 --> 56:04.563
Good luck.

56:54.860 --> 56:57.652
Hello. Welcome.

56:58.152 --> 57:00.027
Hello.

57:00.818 --> 57:02.693
Hello.

57:03.402 --> 57:05.277
Hello.

57:59.198 --> 58:01.073
I have been fired.

58:01.907 --> 58:03.823
They took over the radio.

58:17.658 --> 58:22.825
When you get to the safe house,
you must ask where is the blacksmith.

58:24.409 --> 58:27.117
This will be enough for your family.

58:34.910 --> 58:39.118
If they catch you,
please destroy the list, OK?

58:43.202 --> 58:45.077
Be safe.

58:48.661 --> 58:50.536
Thank you.

59:03.162 --> 59:05.037
We should cross today.

59:08.704 --> 59:10.579
We have time.

59:11.788 --> 59:14.454
No, no we can't trust anyone.

59:16.079 --> 59:18.539
We can trust our informant.

59:43.957 --> 59:46.332
- I will be fine.
- Are you sure?

59:50.041 --> 59:51.916
I will catch a tram.

59:54.542 --> 59:56.417
Goodbye.

01:01:02.422 --> 01:01:04.297
I was never a good wife

01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:08.464
...more of a lover.

01:01:10.006 --> 01:01:11.881
But...

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.631
...never a good wife.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:20.549
I often sin against
the goodness of your heart.

01:01:22.257 --> 01:01:24.132
I neglect you.

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:28.715
I always rely on your being there.

01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:45.134
Will you ever forgive me?

01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:10.094
I think it is time to leave.

01:02:17.761 --> 01:02:19.845
Thank you, Lida, thank you.

01:02:23.012 --> 01:02:25.095
- Alois.
- Milada.

01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:27.970
We have been friends for many years.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:31.513
- I hope you trust me.
- Of course.

01:02:33.846 --> 01:02:36.763
Have you been speaking to Communists?

01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:39.805
You know, I talk to everyone.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.681
Have you accepted the position within?

01:02:45.472 --> 01:02:50.347
Milada, I will go
where I can best serve the people.

01:02:50.889 --> 01:02:52.764
So you have.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:56.265
I did not.

01:02:58.057 --> 01:02:59.932
Not yet.

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.015
What do they have on you?

01:03:07.808 --> 01:03:10.766
- My family.
- I have a family too.

01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:14.099
But your parents are not German.

01:03:25.184 --> 01:03:27.059
Thank you.

01:03:57.687 --> 01:04:00.437
Gottwald is the head of government

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.646
approximately 300 are in urgent need to
escape or at high risk of prosecution.

01:04:06.979 --> 01:04:10.688
The Communists
have overtaken the government.

01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:16.313
Annette, this is the latest
intelligence from Czechoslovakia.

01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:48.691
I'll quickly finish up everything at work,
and will meet you and Jana at two.

01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:09.526
Yes, I will do it.

01:05:15.526 --> 01:05:17.818
- Maruska.
- Good afternoon.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.527
Thank you.

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:30.070
What?

01:05:30.153 --> 01:05:32.361
What is the problem?

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:37.570
Keys.

01:05:41.236 --> 01:05:43.112
Sit down.

01:06:13.823 --> 01:06:15.698
- Who are you?
- Police.

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:19.032
Come on.

01:06:26.324 --> 01:06:28.199
Sit down.

01:06:28.782 --> 01:06:30.658
Sit down!

01:06:47.701 --> 01:06:51.617
I have worked for Mrs. Horakova
for over ten years.

01:07:14.036 --> 01:07:17.494
- What people? Their names?
- I am just a help.

01:07:17.953 --> 01:07:19.829
I was never introduced.

01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:26.704
I must get your mom.

01:07:29.454 --> 01:07:31.330
I will come back for you.

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:34.580
Sugar?

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.663
They don't drink tea.

01:07:41.746 --> 01:07:45.164
Mrs. Horakova's guests
never asked for tea.

01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:46.539
That's all

01:08:48.044 --> 01:08:49.919
- Hello?
- It's me.

01:08:50.086 --> 01:08:51.502
Veruska.

01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:18.796
I thought the three of you
might want to come for dinner tonight.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.255
No talk of politics. Just family.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.255
Oh Vera I have to go.

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.506
I have visitors.

01:10:30.345 --> 01:10:33.636
On what legal grounds
am I being arrested?

01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:47.059
State your name and date of birth.

01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:51.101
Milada Horakova, born Kralova.

01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:54.268
December 25, 1901.

01:11:55.893 --> 01:11:59.477
When did you first engage
in political activities?

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.602
I have the right to know
why I am being held.

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:04.685
You don't have any rights.

01:12:04.768 --> 01:12:09.353
Presumption of innocence,
and according to Law 1523 Paragraph 4B,

01:12:09.436 --> 01:12:13.436
I have the right to know
what I am being arrested for.

01:12:14.978 --> 01:12:17.686
Where is my husband and my daughter?

01:12:19.604 --> 01:12:23.687
First, tell me.
Then we can discuss your family.

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.520
Do you have children?

01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:29.812
No, no, no.

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:33.938
I am the one asking the questions!

01:13:11.274 --> 01:13:13.149
Hello, Mrs. Horakova.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.566
Do you remember me?

01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:22.400
I did an interview with you.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.859
It was a long time ago.

01:13:31.985 --> 01:13:33.860
This is your bed.

01:13:50.819 --> 01:13:52.694
If you ended up here,

01:13:54.903 --> 01:13:56.862
no one is safe.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:12.571
You need to find something on her.

01:14:12.988 --> 01:14:15.779
I spent the last four months
interrogating her.

01:14:15.863 --> 01:14:18.322
If there was anything,
we would have found it.

01:14:18.405 --> 01:14:21.072
- Be creative.
- How?

01:15:06.618 --> 01:15:10.076
Let's give her one hour of
interrupted sleep and then continue.

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:13.118
But she's been up for two days now.
Still not working.

01:15:13.201 --> 01:15:15.076
So what?

01:15:20.494 --> 01:15:22.369
Go in.

01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:38.161
The case has no substance.

01:15:38.245 --> 01:15:42.412
I have no evidence to build on,
no clues, no witnesses.

01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:50.954
I don't understand
which one of them is the one to go after.

01:16:04.455 --> 01:16:06.331
Her?

01:16:07.206 --> 01:16:09.081
And?

01:16:09.706 --> 01:16:11.581
She needs to learn this.

01:16:14.914 --> 01:16:16.789
You can leave now.

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.540
I don't know how to approach this.

01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.500
We trust you'll find the way.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:50.917
Beautiful wife and very young daughter.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:31.755
Bring another one!

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.796
Milada, I am sorry. They forced me.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.755
Quiet!

01:17:50.756 --> 01:17:52.631
Leave us.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.843
- But we're family.
- I cannot help you.

01:18:36.468 --> 01:18:39.385
Even the Nazis allowed us to visit her.

01:19:03.095 --> 01:19:04.970
I don't understand.

01:19:05.553 --> 01:19:07.554
We broke them all but her.

01:19:14.429 --> 01:19:17.721
- We will do this differently.
- How?

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.764
Her family.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.515
Let me do this.

01:19:31.515 --> 01:19:33.390
I am a woman.

01:19:35.348 --> 01:19:37.098
Fine.

01:19:37.765 --> 01:19:39.515
Thanks.

01:19:52.807 --> 01:19:54.683
Stay still.

01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:04.142
Water?

01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:43.812
Vera.

01:20:52.854 --> 01:20:54.730
Have you seen Milada?

01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:56.938
How is she?

01:20:57.647 --> 01:21:01.563
It's no longer safe for you here.
You have to leave.

01:21:02.022 --> 01:21:03.897
Not without Jana.

01:21:07.023 --> 01:21:08.898
They are watching her.

01:21:10.523 --> 01:21:12.356
No, no.

01:21:14.814 --> 01:21:19.190
Once you are in Germany,
you will get her through the Red Cross.

01:22:16.319 --> 01:22:18.195
You had a bad dream.

01:22:19.362 --> 01:22:21.237
It all will be fine.

01:22:23.279 --> 01:22:25.154
I was with my daughter

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.071
in the most beautiful place.

01:23:17.949 --> 01:23:19.825
Tell Jana I will get her.

01:23:21.367 --> 01:23:23.950
- Promise her.
- I will.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:27.242
You need to go.

01:23:40.035 --> 01:23:41.910
That's irrelevant!

01:23:42.411 --> 01:23:48.202
You cooperated with Western Imperialists
to destabilize the elected government!

01:23:48.286 --> 01:23:53.119
An opposition does not destabilize
a legitimate government.

01:23:53.744 --> 01:23:55.412
Here.

01:23:55.495 --> 01:23:59.495
I have aided and cooperated
with Western Imperialist

01:23:59.578 --> 01:24:04.287
in destabilizing democratically
elected communist government!

01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:06.246
Your last chance.

01:24:06.454 --> 01:24:08.329
Sign it.

01:24:16.204 --> 01:24:18.372
We will do this differently.

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:08.209
Interrogation!

01:25:47.587 --> 01:25:50.212
Still claiming innocence, right?

01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.297
Think about your family.

01:26:00.005 --> 01:26:04.380
You can see them so soon
if you just confess.

01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:43.467
Haven't they suffered enough?

01:26:48.134 --> 01:26:50.009
If I were you,

01:26:52.009 --> 01:26:53.884
I would sign.

01:26:56.927 --> 01:26:59.218
It's good to have principles,

01:27:00.927 --> 01:27:04.260
but you still have a daughter,

01:27:05.218 --> 01:27:07.094
husband.

01:27:19.012 --> 01:27:21.345
One last time.

01:27:25.429 --> 01:27:27.304
Sign it.

01:27:31.263 --> 01:27:33.138
Sign it.

01:28:13.308 --> 01:28:15.933
Your daughter is with your sister.

01:28:17.183 --> 01:28:19.059
And my husband?

01:28:38.768 --> 01:28:44.936
I have aided and cooperated
with Western Imperialist powers

01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:55.270
in destabilizing the democratically
elected communist government.

01:30:01.275 --> 01:30:05.400
I confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:09.609
against the democratically
elected Communist government,

01:30:09.693 --> 01:30:12.734
with the intention of aiding
Western Imperialists

01:30:12.818 --> 01:30:15.734
to undermine our national integrity.

01:30:16.859 --> 01:30:18.735
It is correct.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.985
You see, you realized
how wrong you were in the end.

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:36.528
Now just make sure
it sounds like you believe it.

01:30:42.029 --> 01:30:46.196
Confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

01:30:46.279 --> 01:30:51.446
against the democratically
elected Communist government.

01:30:57.405 --> 01:31:01.947
Make sure they are well cleaned up
and fed before the trial.

01:31:08.656 --> 01:31:11.489
Against the Communist government.

01:31:55.368 --> 01:31:57.243
It's so tragic.

01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:01.452
We're working to build this country,
and they want to destroy it.

01:32:01.535 --> 01:32:03.368
I hope they all hang.

01:32:40.746 --> 01:32:42.539
Traitor!

01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:28.125
State your name.

01:33:28.917 --> 01:33:31.418
- Frana Zeminova.
- Zavis Kalandra.

01:33:31.501 --> 01:33:34.293
- Josef Nestaval.
- Milada Horakova.

01:33:34.418 --> 01:33:37.043
Are you aware of the charges against you?

01:33:37.126 --> 01:33:39.001
I am.

01:33:40.251 --> 01:33:42.544
- I am.
- Yes, I am.

01:33:42.627 --> 01:33:44.794
- Yes.
- Do you plead guilty to these crimes?

01:33:44.877 --> 01:33:49.627
Confess to leading
a traitors' resistance movement

01:33:50.044 --> 01:33:51.252
I am.

01:33:51.336 --> 01:33:56.628
Against the democratically
elected Communist government

01:33:57.253 --> 01:34:00.087
I am guilty of all I have confessed to.

01:34:00.628 --> 01:34:05.253
However, I do not believe
they constituted any wrong doing.

01:34:11.463 --> 01:34:14.296
Mrs. Horakova, as a defendant

01:34:14.379 --> 01:34:19.505
you are trying to excuse
acts of treason and conspiracy.

01:34:21.214 --> 01:34:23.547
Only according to one's conscience.

01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:28.005
You conspired against
everyday people of this country,

01:34:28.505 --> 01:34:32.090
factory workers, children, mothers.

01:34:57.967 --> 01:34:59.842
It is a farce trial.

01:35:01.717 --> 01:35:03.508
Are you sure?

01:35:05.967 --> 01:35:07.843
Nothing but theater.

01:35:15.218 --> 01:35:17.926
She thinks it's a farce trial.

01:35:19.677 --> 01:35:22.844
Nothing but theater, she said.

01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:27.385
When asleep, she started calling Jana.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.845
She woke up at approximately 10PM.

01:35:36.303 --> 01:35:38.136
That's enough.

01:35:38.261 --> 01:35:40.136
Take her out.

01:35:47.971 --> 01:35:50.804
I remain faithful to my convictions.

01:35:51.554 --> 01:35:53.429
Freedom.

01:35:53.554 --> 01:35:55.430
Equality.

01:35:55.763 --> 01:35:57.638
Democracy.

01:35:57.805 --> 01:35:59.680
Compassion.

01:36:00.263 --> 01:36:04.638
No one in this country
should be imprisoned or made to die

01:36:05.388 --> 01:36:07.264
for their beliefs.

01:36:07.598 --> 01:36:12.139
Comrade, I did not ask you
for a dictionary.

01:36:13.056 --> 01:36:16.306
The ordinary worker
wants hear honest answers,

01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:18.890
not evasive, bourgeois jargon.

01:36:19.265 --> 01:36:24.140
rs. Horakova, tell us clearly if you are
guilty of conspiring in an illegal way

01:36:24.224 --> 01:36:28.557
against our people
and the democratic Czechoslovakia?

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.558
Yes, I am guilty of that.

01:36:31.225 --> 01:36:33.975
Now, that is a clear statement.

01:36:36.683 --> 01:36:42.226
Mrs. Horakova, you claim that you are
guilty of treason and conspiracy,

01:36:42.434 --> 01:36:44.809
but only under the current law,

01:36:45.434 --> 01:36:49.517
were treason and conspiracy
legal under the old law?

01:36:51.184 --> 01:36:53.559
Not in the way you interpret it.

01:36:54.268 --> 01:36:58.810
Thank you, I need no
further response from this defendant.

01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:45.314
And we found those enemies of the people.

01:37:45.564 --> 01:37:50.106
We were able to find them,
and we brought them here to trial.

01:37:51.314 --> 01:37:56.565
The accused Milada Horakova
was organizing adverse groups

01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:58.857
to destroy our country!

01:37:59.565 --> 01:38:03.940
<i>These terrorists
were planning the Third World War</i>

01:38:04.023 --> 01:38:08.108
<i>with the Western Imperialist
to destroy us all.</i>

01:38:08.524 --> 01:38:11.233
<i>But we are smarter than them.</i>

01:38:11.316 --> 01:38:14.524
<i>We found them
and brought them to justice.</i>

01:38:15.233 --> 01:38:20.942
<i>Your honor, I ask for the harshest
punishment for all of them.</i>

01:38:24.025 --> 01:38:28.942
<i>The execution
is scheduled for the 27th of June.</i>

01:38:46.694 --> 01:38:49.277
If you ask the court for clemency,

01:38:49.944 --> 01:38:52.944
they may commute your sentence to life.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.820
I have done nothing wrong.

01:39:17.154 --> 01:39:20.114
- What is this?
- Clemency requests.

01:39:21.239 --> 01:39:22.155
I plead with you

01:39:22.239 --> 01:39:25.655
not to carry out the death sentences
on Milada Horakova and company, STOP,

01:39:26.447 --> 01:39:30.073
they were victims of Nazism and suffered
in the concentration camps, STOP,

01:39:30.156 --> 01:39:32.573
I am deeply convinced
they deserve to live.

01:39:33.198 --> 01:39:36.031
Signed Professor Albert Einstein.

01:39:36.656 --> 01:39:38.531
Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:39:39.448 --> 01:39:41.323
Winston Churchill.

01:39:42.324 --> 01:39:44.199
Jean-Paul Sartre.

01:39:44.407 --> 01:39:46.241
Who?

01:39:47.324 --> 01:39:49.616
From her father and daughter.

01:40:42.621 --> 01:40:44.496
Hello?

01:40:45.496 --> 01:40:47.371
Yes.

01:40:53.412 --> 01:40:55.288
I see.

01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.497
Thank you.

01:41:04.788 --> 01:41:06.664
Clemency was denied.

01:44:24.347 --> 01:44:26.639
Don't tell her about the baby.

01:44:43.516 --> 01:44:45.391
It is good to see you.

01:44:46.557 --> 01:44:49.557
No physical contact with the prisoner.

01:44:54.183 --> 01:44:56.058
How is father?

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.475
Holding up.

01:45:03.225 --> 01:45:07.059
I agree it is better
that you asked him not to come.

01:45:12.226 --> 01:45:14.518
I am not sure how he would

01:45:20.269 --> 01:45:23.269
I wish I knew what happened to Bohuslav.

01:45:25.269 --> 01:45:27.144
They will not tell me.

01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:35.561
Mamma, you haven't done anything,
why are they doing this?

01:45:37.770 --> 01:45:41.270
Auntie will explain it to you in time.

01:45:46.062 --> 01:45:48.562
Aunt Vera is pregnant.

01:45:59.897 --> 01:46:01.813
That is wonderful, Vera.

01:46:08.564 --> 01:46:11.189
You will make a great mother, Vera.

01:46:14.398 --> 01:46:17.314
I still remember the day you were born.

01:46:18.857 --> 01:46:23.149
Mother was so sick
that father had to run and get a doctor

01:46:23.232 --> 01:46:25.774
and then he placed you in my arms,

01:46:27.357 --> 01:46:29.232
when I held you

01:46:29.815 --> 01:46:31.900
you were my first daughter.

01:46:35.025 --> 01:46:36.941
So much have changed.

01:46:38.858 --> 01:46:41.941
And just now I am so sorry

01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:45.567
I will never be able to repay you.

01:46:46.526 --> 01:46:48.901
She will be able to stay with us.

01:46:49.776 --> 01:46:51.651
We are all a family.

01:46:52.317 --> 01:46:54.402
I will take a good care of them.

01:46:54.568 --> 01:46:56.443
Thank you.

01:46:57.610 --> 01:46:59.485
Mamma.

01:47:03.568 --> 01:47:05.443
When you think of me,

01:47:06.694 --> 01:47:10.528
know that I am always always with you.

01:47:16.486 --> 01:47:19.320
Can I hold my daughter, one last time?

01:47:19.904 --> 01:47:22.362
No physical contact is allowed.

01:47:25.445 --> 01:47:27.487
It's time for you to leave.

01:47:34.821 --> 01:47:37.988
I embrace you and kiss you from here.

01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:58.657
I will always be with you.

01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:07.866
Always.

01:48:10.533 --> 01:48:12.408
Always.

01:49:02.787 --> 01:49:04.662
Why did it come to this?

01:49:09.788 --> 01:49:13.079
Would you have done anything differently?

01:49:17.121 --> 01:49:20.664
I have always done
what I believed to be right.

01:49:40.456 --> 01:49:42.332
I am scared.

01:51:47.009 --> 01:51:48.884
Any last words?

01:51:49.467 --> 01:51:51.342
I fall.

01:51:51.676 --> 01:51:53.551
I lost this battle.

01:51:54.010 --> 01:51:55.885
I leave honorably.

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.885
I love this country.

01:51:58.968 --> 01:52:00.843
I love her people.

01:52:01.218 --> 01:52:03.093
I leave without hatred.

01:52:22.637 --> 01:52:28.137
<i>My Jana, providence
planned my life in such a way</i>

01:52:28.637 --> 01:52:31.013
<i>that I could not give you my all.</i>

01:52:31.888 --> 01:52:35.388
<i>But I felt my calling was to do you good</i>

01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:39.680
<i>by seeing that all children can live well.</i>

01:52:41.263 --> 01:52:44.056
<i>And so, my little girl,</i>

01:52:45.181 --> 01:52:49.014
<i>my hope, my future forgiveness.</i>

01:52:50.056 --> 01:52:54.390
<i>Live! Grasp life with both hands!</i>

01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:59.223
<i>Until my last breath
I shall pray for your happiness.</i>

01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:02.807
<i>I shall always be with you.</i>

01:53:48.186 --> 01:53:51.769
Tell us about yourself.
You're now a US citizen?

01:53:51.852 --> 01:53:54.770
I am sorry for having left you waiting.

01:53:56.312 --> 01:53:59.228
This press conference is not about me,

01:53:59.728 --> 01:54:02.520
it's about a woman, my mother,

01:54:03.478 --> 01:54:07.604
who left a legacy behind
that we can all look up to.

01:54:07.771 --> 01:54:10.854
Your mother was an extraordinary woman.

01:54:12.313 --> 01:54:14.188
Yes.

01:54:15.146 --> 01:54:20.064
She wanted me to be more like her,
but I could never achieve that.

01:54:21.272 --> 01:54:27.189
I think it best,
if we hear her last words here today.

01:54:34.815 --> 01:54:36.690
Life is hard,

01:54:37.731 --> 01:54:39.731
it does not pamper anyone,

01:54:40.981 --> 01:54:46.482
and for every time it strokes you
it gives you ten blows.

01:54:48.482 --> 01:54:52.816
Man doesn't live alone in this world;

01:54:53.816 --> 01:54:59.442
in that there is great happiness,
but also a tremendous responsibility.

01:55:01.192 --> 01:55:08.026
Our obligation is not acting selfishly
but rather merging

01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:11.109
<i>with the needs and the goals of others.</i>

01:55:13.068 --> 01:55:15.359
<i>Learn to be modest.</i>

01:55:15.443 --> 01:55:20.610
<i>You will not be unhappy because of
material things you don't have.</i>

01:55:21.610 --> 01:55:24.944
<i>When you come to
consider something just,</i>

01:55:25.027 --> 01:55:30.778
<i>be so definite
that you can fight and die for it.</i>

01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:35.445
<i>Don't feel sorry for me.</i>

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:38.736
<i>I lived a beautiful life.</i>

01:55:39.736 --> 01:55:42.529
<i>I accept my punishment humbly.</i>

01:55:43.237 --> 01:55:48.321
<i>My conscience is clear
and I believe and pray</i>

01:55:48.404 --> 01:55:54.530
<i>that I shall also pass the test
of the higher court, of God.</i>

01:55:56.530 --> 01:56:01.530
<i>Go to the meadows,
the fields and the forests,</i>

01:56:02.447 --> 01:56:06.489
<i>there in the smell of
the blooming blossoms</i>

01:56:06.948 --> 01:56:09.614
<i>you will find a part of me.</i>

01:57:19.734 --> 01:57:24.734
