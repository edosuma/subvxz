WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.271
>> Julie: A BLINDSIDE MAY BE IN

00:03.304 --> 00:04.972
THE WORKS, BUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE
IS ABOUT TO BE BLINDSIDED BY

00:05.005 --> 00:09.977
ANOTHER DOUBLE EVICTION.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.580
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

00:15.116 --> 00:16.050
.

00:16.084 --> 00:19.019
>> Announcer:
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER":

00:19.053 --> 00:21.155
TH CHRIS JINGLING ALL THE
WAY TO POWER--

00:21.189 --> 00:25.426
>> CHRISTMAS ISEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD!

00:25.459 --> 00:28.028
>> Announcer: ...SHE PLANNED
TO TAKE A SHOT AT THE COWBOY.

00:28.062 --> 00:32.233
>> JASON IS MY NUMBER ONE TARGET
BUT ALEX I MY BACKUP.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.602
WE HAVE TO SPLIT THIS SUPER
COUPLE.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.305
>> Announcer: AND HER ALLY,
PAUL, MASTERMINDED THE EXECUTION

00:37.338 --> 00:39.173
OF HER PLAN.

00:39.207 --> 00:48.416
ALEX AND JASON BELIEVED KEVIN
WAS THE TARGET.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.817
>> OKAY!

00:49.850 --> 00:52.186
>> Announcer: SO WHEN THEY
WENT UP ON THE BLOCK...

00:52.220 --> 00:55.022
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ALEX,
AND YOU, JASON.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.724
>> Announcer: ...ALICE FELT
SAFE.

00:56.757 --> 01:00.328
>> I DO TRUST CHRISTMAS AND I
TRUST HER JUDGMENT IN THIS

01:00.361 --> 01:01.162
DECISION.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.563
SHE MUST HAVE A PLAN TO BACKDOOR
KEVIN.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.132
>> Announcer: BUT JASON WAS
NERVOUS.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.334
>> CHRISTMAS PUT ME AND ALEX ON
THE BLOCK.

01:06.367 --> 01:10.138
THE LIFE INSTANTLY GOT SUCKED
OUT OF ME.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.507
I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THE PLAN
WAS TO GET KEVIN OUT SO I DON'T

01:13.541 --> 01:16.644
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.079
>> Announcer: WITH PAUL
PLAYING ALL SIDES OF THE

01:19.113 --> 01:24.252
HOUSE...

01:24.285 --> 01:26.320
JOSH STARTED TO GET SUSPICIOUS
OF THE BEARDED ROCKER.

01:26.354 --> 01:31.058
>> SO PAUL WAS ORIGINALLY PART
OF THIS PLAN, BUT NOW HE'S

01:31.091 --> 01:32.926
TRYING TO GET ON EVERYBODY'S
GOOD SIDE.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.094
THIS GUY'S GOOD.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.096
HE'S WORKING ALL ANGLES.

01:36.130 --> 01:39.267
HE'S WORKING EVERYBODY, AND I'M
EVEN BUYING IT.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.170
>> Announcer: AND AFTER JASON
MADE A JOKE THAT HIT TOO CLOSE

01:42.203 --> 01:43.204
TO HOME...

01:43.237 --> 01:47.641
>> APPARENTLY YOU'RE IN AN
ALLIANCE WITH CHRISTMAS.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.777
>> WHAT?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.345
>> I WAS JUST MAKING THIS UP.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.348
>> YOU CAN'T DO THINGS LIKE
THAT.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.083
>> Announcer: ...JOSH RAISED
THE RED FLAG TO CHRISTMAS.

01:56.116 --> 02:00.454
>> YOU NEED SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND
STOP SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.089
OKAY, I HEARD IT, TAKEN.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.859
BUT IF YOU KEEP PREACHING,
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HEAR

02:05.893 --> 02:10.364
>> Announcer: WITH THE POWER
OF VETO ON THE LINE... PAUL

02:10.398 --> 02:13.867
PUNCHED, KICKED, AND SLAPPED HIS
WAY TO VICTORY.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.803
>> WOOO!

02:15.836 --> 02:19.106
LOOKS LIKE ALL THOSE BEATINGS
WERE WORTH IT.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.075
THANKS TO ME, MYSELF, AND I, I
HAVE THE VETO AND I GET TO SPLIT

02:22.109 --> 02:24.312
UP ANOTHER PAIR IN THE HOUSE,
JASON AND ALEX.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.681
>> Announcer: JOSH PROPOSED
THAT THE NOMINATIONS REMAIN THE

02:27.715 --> 02:28.582
SAME.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.184
>> WOULD YOU CONSIDER NOT USING
THE VETO?

02:30.218 --> 02:32.286
THIS IS HOW I THINK IT PROTECTS
ALL THREE OF US.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.055
>> Announcer: BUT PAUL WASN'T
PLAYING BALL WITH THE MEATBALL.

02:35.088 --> 02:40.594
>> YOU MIGHT THINK THAT ME NOT
USING THE VETO IS THE BEST-CASE

02:40.628 --> 02:43.130
SCENARIO FOR THE THREE OF US,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M

02:43.163 --> 02:47.968
PLAYING FOR ME, SO I'M GOING TO
GO AHEAD AND GO WITH PLAN "A."

02:48.001 --> 02:50.238
>> Announcer: AT THE VETO
MEETING, PAUL USED HIS POWER.

02:50.271 --> 02:54.675
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON ALEX.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.945
>> Announcer: AND CHRISTMAS
PUT UP A FAUX TARGET.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.981
>> KEVIN, PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.218
>> ALL MY WORRYING WAS FOR
NOTHING, BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE

03:04.252 --> 03:05.719
KEVIN IS GOING TO GO HOME.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.722
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T GET ANY
BETTER THAN TO HAVE A TEAM LIKE

03:08.756 --> 03:09.957
PAUL AND ALEX.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.960
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, WILL
JASON WALK OFF INTO THE SUNSET,

03:12.993 --> 03:14.928
OR WILL JOSH FLIP THE GAME ON
ITS HEAD?

03:14.962 --> 03:20.701
PLUS A SECOND HOUSEGUEST WILL BE
LEAVING BECAUSE IT'S DOUBLE

03:20.734 --> 03:21.902
EVICTION NIGHT, BABY.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.506
GEAR UP FOR A FULL WEEK OF GAME
PLAY, ALL IN ONE HOUR, RIGHT

03:25.539 --> 03:29.977
NOW, LIVE, ON "BIG BROTHER."

03:30.010 --> 03:32.380
>> I'M HAVING A MEATBALL MOMENT!

04:14.622 --> 04:16.924
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.394
I'M JULIE CHEN.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.996
WELCOME TO THE SECOND DOUBLE
EVICTION OF THE SUMMER.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.933
WE ARE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY
FROM CROWNING THE WINNER OF "BIG

04:25.966 --> 04:31.372
BROTHER," AND SO FAR, PAUL HAS
BEEN IN COMMAND OF THE GAME,

04:31.405 --> 04:35.108
PLOTTING, SCHEMING, AND STEERING
THE SHIP.

04:35.142 --> 04:39.012
BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS ARE
STARTING TO TAKE NOTICE.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.814
SO, WITH A DOUBLE EVICTION IN
PLAY, WILL SOMEONE TAKE A SHOT

04:40.848 --> 04:42.850
AT HIM TONIGHT?

04:42.883 --> 04:46.387
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.323
BUT, FIRST, EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING
HIGH, AS FRIENDS ARE NOW FACED

04:49.357 --> 04:52.793
WITH BETRAYING ONE ANOTHER.

04:52.826 --> 05:01.535
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.003
>> TAKES OFF ALEX.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.272
I PUT UP KEVIN.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.408
AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING
TO PLAN.

05:07.441 --> 05:11.679
JASON AND ALEX DON'T SEEM UPSET
OR THREATENED THATASON MIGH HOME

05:11.712 --> 05:17.284
I REALLYTOPE THE HOUSE CAN
STAY CALM UNTIL THURSDAY, WHEN

05:17.317 --> 05:19.920
WE SEND COWBO JURY.

05:19.953 --> 05:26.293
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
THEIR STRATEGY WHEN YOU HAVE

05:26.326 --> 05:28.028
ONE OF THEM OUT.

05:28.061 --> 05:34.735
BUT I'M GOING TO PROBABLY GO TO
JURY THURSDAY NIGHT.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.536
>> GOOD.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.771
>> KEVIN'S GOING HOME!

05:37.805 --> 05:40.574
I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN DYING FOR
THIS MOMENT, AND NOW IT'S

05:40.608 --> 05:42.342
ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN!

05:42.376 --> 05:43.444
>> WANT TO PLAY CHESS?

05:43.477 --> 05:43.944
>> NO.

05:43.977 --> 05:48.315
>> NO?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.451
THIS COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY
BETTER.

05:50.484 --> 05:54.021
IF KEVIN'S UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT
MEANS ALEX IS COMFORTABLE, AND

05:54.054 --> 05:58.459
IF ALEX IS COMFORTABLE, THAT
MEANS JASON IS COMFORTABLE.

05:58.492 --> 06:03.230
COME EVICTION NIGHT, BOOM!

06:03.263 --> 06:07.000
BLINDSIDE!

06:07.034 --> 06:08.569
>> ME AND YOU.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.003
>> I KNOW, ME AND YOU, MAN.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.405
>> IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.139
>> YEAH.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.642
>> I THINK THEY'LL SAVE YOU.

06:14.675 --> 06:19.513
>> I MEAN, I DON'T SEE HOW
THERE'S ANY WAY ALEX IS GOING TO

06:19.547 --> 06:20.714
VOTE AGAINST ME.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.116
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE A
BETTER SCENARIO FOR MYSELF.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.084
PAUL PULLED THROUGH AGAIN.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.287
HE DID EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE
WAS GOING TO DO.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.088
KEVIN'S THE TRGET.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.823
I ABSOLUTELY DO FEEL BAD FOR THE
GUY.

06:29.857 --> 06:33.226
HE'S STILL M PAL, AND I'M GOI
TO WISH HIM WELL, BUT IT'S GOING

06:33.260 --> 06:42.670
TO BE BYE FOR NOW.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.805
>> DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

06:44.838 --> 06:49.443
>> I'M DRAINED.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.211
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE HIM OUT.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.882
THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING ABOUT
IT, AND ESPECIALLY MY POSITION

06:54.915 --> 06:56.049
IN THE PLAN.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.386
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S THE SAFEST OPTION.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.590
MY STRATEGY TO GET JASON OUT
THIS WEEK WITH MY HANDS

07:02.623 --> 07:06.293
COMPLETELY CLEAN COMES IN TWO
STEPS: WIN THE POWER OF VETO

07:06.326 --> 07:07.928
AND TX OFF THE BLOCK.

07:07.961 --> 07:12.165
NOW THAT I'VE GOT THAT DONE, I
MOVE TO STEP TWO WHICH IS TO

07:12.199 --> 07:14.702
COVER MY TRACKS AND HAVE THE
VOTE COME DOWN TO A TIE.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.237
WE HAVE TO NIKKEI THAI BREAKER.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.440
IF THE VOTES FALL 3-1, IT'S
EXPOSED THAT ALL OF US WERE IN

07:20.474 --> 07:24.845
ON THIS TO GET ONE OF THEM OUT.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.615
IF WE HAVE A THAI BREAKER, YOU
CAN TAKE WHATEVER HEAT, RIGHT?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.383
>> I'M FINE WITH TAKING THE
HEAT.

07:30.417 --> 07:35.956
>> SO YOU AND RAVEN ARE GOING TO
BE THE VOTES AGAINST JASON.

07:35.989 --> 07:40.093
ME AND ALEX ARE GOING TO BE THE
VOTES AGAINST KEVIN.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.930
CHRISTMAS IS GOING TO BREAK THE
TIE.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.465
IF I GET EVERYONE TO VOTE THE
WAY THAT I WANT TO, I COME OUT

07:45.499 --> 07:47.300
OF THIS PLAN COMPLETELY CLEAN.

07:47.334 --> 07:51.004
I HAVE EVERYBODY DOING THE DIRTY
WORK FOR ME, AND I STILL HAVE

07:51.038 --> 07:56.476
ALEX IN MY BACK POCKET BECAUSE
NT AGAINST HT I NEED JOSH ON BOA

07:56.510 --> 08:00.848
GOING TO FALL APART.OLE PLAN IS
YOU NEED TO PLAY THE PLAN OR

08:00.881 --> 08:02.015
ELSE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.318
YOU.T'S NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST
IT'S THAI KNOW WHAT'S COMING

08:05.352 --> 08:06.453
MY WAY.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.857
I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS PLAN
THAT PAUL PUT IN MOTION.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.926
IT PROTECTS PAUL, AND THEN ALL
THE FINGERS ARE POINTED AT ME

08:12.960 --> 08:15.529
AND CHRISTMAS, AND ALL THE BLOOD
IS ON OUR HANDS.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.532
I FEEL LIKE NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO GO AGAINST THE GROUP.

08:18.566 --> 08:22.335
BUT STILL, I HAVE TO POTECT ME
AND MY GIRL CHRISTMAS' GAME THE

08:22.369 --> 08:23.136
BEST WAY I CAN.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.006
>> YOU'RE NOT PLAYING RIGHT NOW,
BRO.

08:26.039 --> 08:32.580
GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.349
>> OH!

08:36.383 --> 08:39.987
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, BIG MAN?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.054
>> ABOUT WHAT?

08:41.088 --> 08:44.592
>> EVERYTHING.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.426
YOU KN WHAT I DON'T FEEL GOOD
AB

08:46.459 --> 08:47.527
>> WHAT.

08:47.561 --> 09:00.741
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND NOW?

09:00.774 --> 09:01.274
HUH?

09:01.308 --> 09:07.414
YOU CAN TELL ME, PAL.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.115
JASON HAS TO GO.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.217
IT'S CLEAR AS DAY.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.921
HE'S JUST TOO STRONG OF A
COMPETITOR, BUT THIS MOVE RIGHT

09:13.954 --> 09:16.123
HERE COMPLETELY TAKES A SHOT
DIRECT AT MY GAME.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.994
AND TO KNOW THAT I AM PART OF A
BLINDSIDE THAT'S COMING HIS WAY,

09:21.028 --> 09:22.562
IT'S BREAKING MY HEART.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.330
.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.633
>> WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.234
>> HURTING.

09:27.267 --> 09:35.809
OR... IT'S PUTTING ME IN A
POSITION WHERE I LOOK LIKE A

09:35.843 --> 09:40.848
COMPLETE SNAKE, WHERE I'M
LITERALLY BLINDSIDING A FRIEND.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.851
SOMEBODY THAT HAS HELPED ME SO
MUCH IN THIS HOUSE.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.452
AND I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

09:45.485 --> 09:49.089
AND I HAVEN'T FELT GOOD ABOUT IT
ALL WEEK.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.891
DON'T TELL NOBODY I HAD A
MOMENT, PLEASE.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
>> I WON'T.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.562
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO THROUGH

09:55.595 --> 09:56.697
WITH IT.

09:56.730 --> 10:07.474
BUT IF I WANTED TO PULL A CRAZY
MOVE, I CAN BLOW TSOUSE.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.409
>> Julie: IT'S TIME FOR THE
FIRST EVICTION OF THE NIGHT.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.912
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND LET THE HOUSEGUESTS IN ON

10:11.945 --> 10:15.615
TONIGHT'S DOUBLE EVICTION.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.184
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.353
>> HEY, JULIE!

10:20.387 --> 10:25.558
>> Julie: WELL, IF YOU'RE DOING
THE MATH, YOU PROBABLY REALIZED

10:25.592 --> 10:28.228
THAT THERE ARE SEVEN OF YOU
LEFT, AND LESS THAN TWO WEEKS

10:28.261 --> 10:30.964
BEFORE WE CROWN THE WINNER OF
"BIG BROTHER."

10:30.998 --> 10:32.465
>> OH, MY GOD!

10:32.499 --> 10:34.367
>> Julie: AND THAT CAN MEAN
ONLY ONE THING.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.468
>> OH, NO.

10:35.502 --> 10:35.903
>> Julie: OH, YES.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.871
>> OH, GOD.

10:37.905 --> 10:42.275
>> Julie: IT IS TIME FOR
ANOTHER DOUBLE-EVICTION NIGHT.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.245
BEFORE THE HOUR IS UP, TWO OF
YOU WILL BE JOINING THE JURY,

10:45.278 --> 10:51.952
LEAVING FIVE OF YOU TO BATTLE
YOUR WAY TO FINALE NIGHT.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.988
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TIME
TO WASTE.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.090
SO, JASON, KEVIN, IN JUST A FEW
MOMENTS, YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL

10:57.124 --> 10:58.358
CAST THEIR VOTES TO EVICT LIVE.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.661
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH
HAVE ONE FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY

11:01.695 --> 11:04.397
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF
STATEMENT.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.935
JASON, YOU'RE FIRST.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.469
>> I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS
TO MY WIFE.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.339
I LOVE YOU, HOLLY.

11:12.372 --> 11:12.840
GALLON.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.475
I'LL MAKE IT SHORT.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.947
I POSSESS THE FOUR Cs,
CONFIDENCE, COURAGE, CHARACTER,

11:19.980 --> 11:20.848
AND CHARISMA.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.983
AND I WANT YOU ALL TO KEEP ME IN
THISOUSE.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.019
PLEASE DO NOT VOTE ME
BECAUSE I WANT TO DISPLAY MORE

11:26.053 --> 11:27.520
OF THAT, ESPECIALLY IN A DOUBLE.

11:27.554 --> 11:32.826
SO WHEN YOU GO IN THERE PLEASE
DO NOT VOTE TO EVICT JASON.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.761
>> Julie: THANK YOU, JASON.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.996
>> GOOD LUCK, JASON.

11:36.029 --> 11:40.934
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HI TO MY
FAMILY BACK HOME.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.402
DEBBIE, OLIVIA, AND ANDREW.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.238

17:35.288 --> 17:36.489
BECAUSE I WAS ON THE BLOCK.
