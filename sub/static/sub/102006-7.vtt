09:31.963 --> 09:33.146
That's a good place for it.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.906
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

09:35.099 --> 09:36.408
Oh, my God, you--

09:36.559 --> 09:38.577
MICHAEL: The windows.
Nice, right?

09:38.770 --> 09:40.320
Come take a look.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.971
(laughs)

09:42.032 --> 09:43.582
Yeah, now that I'm home more,

09:43.775 --> 09:45.491
I felt like it would be
too dark in here,

09:45.586 --> 09:48.144
so I wanted to just blow it out
and bring in some more light.

09:48.163 --> 09:50.255
And the homeowners association
approved that?

09:50.406 --> 09:51.648
Because as I recall,

09:51.750 --> 09:54.092
you all were not
on the best of terms.

09:54.285 --> 09:56.502
Dad's HOA president now.

09:56.655 --> 09:58.263
Well, if you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.

09:58.456 --> 10:00.265
And now that I have more time,

10:00.416 --> 10:03.660
well, I felt like I would take
a more active role.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.586
Oh, what's this?

10:05.647 --> 10:08.498
Dad's other new hobby:
spying on the neighbors.

10:08.516 --> 10:09.515
Ah.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.258
Why don't you
pick up your stuff

10:11.320 --> 10:12.502
and take it into your room

10:12.520 --> 10:13.612
instead of throwing it
on my floor?

10:13.763 --> 10:15.171
HARRY: But I'm starving.

10:15.231 --> 10:16.948
MICHAEL: Man, just go.
And wash your hands.

10:17.141 --> 10:18.174
Interesting view.

10:18.193 --> 10:19.451
Yeah, well, who knew

10:19.644 --> 10:21.953
that people watching could be
better than TV?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.955
Look.

10:24.148 --> 10:25.439
Let's see...

10:25.500 --> 10:26.625
yeah.

10:26.818 --> 10:28.701
That's Miles.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.944
You know his name?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.612
No, that's just
what I call him.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.281
You know, he's always running.
He started this exercise kick.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.359
ATHENA: Ooh.
All right, Miles.

10:36.378 --> 10:37.543
Yeah?

10:37.696 --> 10:39.954
Okay, well,
watch, watch, watch.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.431
And...

10:43.310 --> 10:45.000
That's Jackie.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.128
She likes to paint
in the mornings.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.648
ATHENA: Oh, is she any good?

10:49.841 --> 10:51.983
Oh. I guess not.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.985
(both laugh)

10:54.137 --> 10:56.154
-Okay. Okay. All right.
-Aww.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.160
There.
That's my mystery man, Slim.

11:02.311 --> 11:03.887
-Mm-hmm.
-Because he's kinda shady.

11:03.988 --> 11:05.571
ATHENA: Why is he shady?

11:05.724 --> 11:08.375
MICHAEL:
Because he has a lot of trash.

11:10.395 --> 11:12.003
You are watching a lot.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.656
Well, you know, Harry,

11:15.717 --> 11:17.825
he's got a hang
of this homeschooling thing,

11:17.844 --> 11:18.993
so he doesn't need me,

11:19.054 --> 11:20.586
you know, hovering over him
as much.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.682
And David, he's back to doing
his surgeries again.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.426
Well, what about your work?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.686
Hmm?

11:29.714 --> 11:31.022
It's at a standstill.

11:31.174 --> 11:34.751
Not a lot of calls
for new shopping malls

11:34.769 --> 11:37.028
or office buildings.

11:37.221 --> 11:38.863
You know, maybe never again.

11:39.015 --> 11:41.366
Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.

11:41.559 --> 11:43.702
Why didn't you say something?

11:43.895 --> 11:45.537
It's not just that.

11:45.730 --> 11:48.689
<i> (solemn music)</i>

11:48.792 --> 11:51.117
I made a list.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.619
What kind of list?

11:53.755 --> 11:55.621
When I found out
about the tumor last year,

11:55.774 --> 11:57.882
people told me I should have
a bucket list.

11:58.075 --> 11:59.442
Right?

11:59.461 --> 12:00.944
Ended up being a short list,

12:00.962 --> 12:03.112
because the only thing
I ever cared about was my kids

12:03.131 --> 12:06.057
and preparing them
to be without me.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.284
But you got better.

12:08.386 --> 12:10.303
You're still better, right?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

12:13.892 --> 12:16.642
But when I got news
that the tumor was shrinking,

12:16.737 --> 12:18.385
I created a new list.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.887
Of things that I wanted to do,

12:19.906 --> 12:22.056
you know, places that I wanted
to see, and--

12:22.159 --> 12:25.392
And you haven't had a chance
to do any of it.

12:25.454 --> 12:29.989
Instead, I just sit here and...

12:30.125 --> 12:32.375
look at the world
from a distance.

12:39.909 --> 12:40.908
What kind of attack, sir?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.576
<i> IAN: He came out of nowhere!</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:45.171
<i> He jumped right at us!</i>
<i> He slashed my wife's face!</i>

12:45.323 --> 12:47.824
<i> -(scream on phone)</i>
-Sir, what's happening now?

12:47.926 --> 12:50.009
<i> IAN: Oh, my God, he just got</i>
<i> Mrs. Wilde across the street!</i>

12:50.103 --> 12:51.585
<i> He's attacking</i>
<i> the whole neighborhood!</i>

12:51.646 --> 12:53.587
(sirens wailing)

12:53.690 --> 12:55.106
You have to find Sonny.

12:55.299 --> 12:56.775
I mean, if he attacks
one of the children--

12:56.926 --> 12:58.351
Has Sonny ever behaved
like this before?

12:58.487 --> 12:59.593
He just moved
into the neighborhood

12:59.654 --> 13:00.686
a few weeks ago.

13:00.839 --> 13:02.263
We felt sorry for him.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.282
I never dreamed
he would turn on us this way.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.842
HEN: "Hey, neighbor."

13:05.860 --> 13:07.434
-CHIMNEY: That's all she said?
-HEN: That's it.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.178
Just announces
that she's moving back,

13:09.197 --> 13:10.363
and that's all she'll say
on the subject.

13:10.515 --> 13:11.681
You think she wants to move in
with you?

13:11.741 --> 13:13.699
(laughs)
God, no.

13:13.852 --> 13:15.460
Not that Karen didn't try
to talk her into it,

13:15.653 --> 13:17.687
but I made it very clear
to my wife,

13:17.705 --> 13:19.355
we really need to keep
some boundaries.

13:19.415 --> 13:21.448
BUCK: I don't think
that's too much to ask for.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.617
It's not like Veronica knew
that she lived next door to you

13:23.678 --> 13:24.785
when you guys went out.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.453
We don't know that she didn't.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.714
You know, my therapist says
everyone needs a safe space,

13:28.850 --> 13:31.309
a place where you can
fully be yourself.

13:31.502 --> 13:33.386
My apartment was that place.

13:33.538 --> 13:34.871
She's like a bulldozer.

13:34.889 --> 13:38.224
Just barges in and crushes
everyone in her path,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.559
and by everyone, I mean me.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.152
I thought you two
got along great.

13:41.345 --> 13:42.895
-You talk all the time.
-On the phone, Cap.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.714
When she lived four hours away.

13:44.774 --> 13:46.307
The world has changed.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.826
People's priorities have
changed along with it.

13:48.019 --> 13:49.977
Maybe she just wants to be
closer to her family.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.721
And having her around could be
a huge help with Denny and Nia.

13:51.823 --> 13:55.816
My mother has never been
what you might call a helper.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.502
More like an agent of chaos.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.562
Yesterday,
Albert had to distract her

13:59.622 --> 14:02.156
for 20 minutes
while I got my mail.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.675
I've never been the daughter
that she wanted.

14:03.868 --> 14:06.845
You know she still buys me
dresses for Christmas?

14:06.996 --> 14:10.223
I mean, have either of you
ever seen me in a dress?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.143
I think you'd look lovely
in a dress.

14:16.505 --> 14:17.671
BUCK: I just don't wanna live
like this.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.007
Always looking
over my shoulder.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.843

14:22.904 --> 14:24.195
I think he's behind us.

39:02.399 --> 39:06.509

Your father always--

40:17.440 --> 40:19.958
He wasn't there, Ma.
You were.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.085
I tried.

40:22.278 --> 40:24.495
I know...

40:24.648 --> 40:28.258
I didn't always succeed, but...

40:28.409 --> 40:30.260
I really did try.

40:32.747 --> 40:35.323
Remember that time

40:35.383 --> 40:37.508
I was about nine years old

40:37.602 --> 40:40.011
and I told you I didn't feel
like going to school?

40:40.105 --> 40:43.014
And you said, "You don't
have to go to school,

40:43.108 --> 40:47.277
but you have to learn something
every day."

40:49.781 --> 40:53.098
So we went to the library.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.601
And then we went to the park
for a picnic.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.663
I think you read
three books that day.

41:00.149 --> 41:02.183

that little Forrester girl
