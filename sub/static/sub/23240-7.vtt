00:03.900 --> 00:06.600
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.600 --> 00:08.033
AAH!

00:08.033 --> 00:10.733
Jazz: I AM DEFINITELY
ATTRACTED TO VICTORIA,

00:10.733 --> 00:13.367
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET
TO KNOW HER BETTER.

00:13.367 --> 00:15.733
WOULD YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
AGAIN, JUST, LIKE, YOU AND ME?

00:15.733 --> 00:18.033
-YEAH, FOR SURE, DEFINITELY.
-I THINK IT'LL BE FUN.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.167
Jazz: SOMETIMES I JUST
EAT A LOT, EVEN IF I'M FULL.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.633
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.533
I DO LOVE FOOD
AND I DO LOVE EATING,

00:24.533 --> 00:27.000
AND PART OF ME ALMOST
DOESN'T WANT TO LET THAT GO.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.300
BINGE EATING IS A SYMPTOM
OF AN EMOTIONAL STATE.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.433
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO MAKE
A CHANGE IN MY LIFE.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.567
JAZZ HAS BEEN UNHAPPY
WITH SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.100
I COULD GO TO THIS
VIRTUAL SCHOOL

00:37.100 --> 00:39.633
WHERE I COULD JUST FINISH
MY HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS.

00:39.633 --> 00:43.300
I CAN'T PROVIDE HER WHAT SCHOOL
DOES 8 HOURS A DAY, EVERY DAY.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.367
THIS IS NOT
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO,

00:45.367 --> 00:47.933
AND I WASN'T
PREPARED FOR THIS.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.033
THIS IS HARD.

00:49.033 --> 00:52.033
IT'S REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY HARD.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.833
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

00:54.833 --> 00:57.433
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.900
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.367
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY...

01:02.367 --> 01:04.600
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.667
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.800
-COME ON, JAZZ!
-WHOO!

01:07.800 --> 01:10.200
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:10.200 --> 01:12.267
...BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:12.267 --> 01:14.067
I AM JAZZ.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.600
Jeanette: HOW MANY CUPS
OF COFFEE DO YOU DRINK
IN THE MORNING?

01:24.600 --> 01:27.600
ON THE WEEKEND,
I PROBABLY HAVE THREE.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.333
MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT,
YOU WOULDN'T BE AS GROUCHY.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.067
Jeanette: TRY GOING
ONE DAY WITHOUT DRINKING,

01:33.067 --> 01:34.900
AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.
-HI.

01:34.900 --> 01:35.967
-GOOD.

01:35.967 --> 01:37.600
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE OFF
AND RUNNING.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.067
-COME IN!

01:42.067 --> 01:43.467
-HEY.
-HEY!

01:43.467 --> 01:44.667
HOW ARE YOU?

01:44.667 --> 01:47.300
Jeanette: LOOK AT HOW CUTE
THIS PERSON LOOKS.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.900
JAZZ IS VERY MATURE FOR HER AGE,
AND MICHAELA IS AN ADULT,

01:50.900 --> 01:53.767
AND SHE GETS THINGS THAT JAZZ'S
PEERS MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.067
I'M HAPPY THAT SHE'S GOT
AN OLDER FRIEND

01:56.067 --> 01:57.400
THAT SHE CAN LOOK UP TO.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.733
WHERE YOU GOING SHOPPING?

01:58.733 --> 02:01.700
WE'RE JUST GOING TO A LITTLE
BOUTIQUE UP BY WHERE I LIVE.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.433
I ACTUALLY LEAVE
ON A TRIP ON THE 1st,

02:04.433 --> 02:07.733
START OF MY, UH, CAMPAIGN
FOR THE "BE YOU" TOUR,

02:07.733 --> 02:09.567
SO I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR A FEW THINGS

02:09.567 --> 02:12.067
I HAVE TO PICK UP.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.333
YEAH, LET'S HIT IT.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.267
JAZZ,
NO DRIVE-THRU FAST FOOD.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.333
-HEALTHY, HEALTHY, HEALTHY.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.733
-I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.
-YEAH, LET'S GET GOING.

02:20.733 --> 02:22.333
Greg: HAVE FUN!

02:22.333 --> 02:25.300
WHEN MY PARENTS REMIND ME
TO AVOID THE FAST FOOD,

02:25.300 --> 02:27.400
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSED.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.567
THEY'RE ALWAYS ON MY CASE,

02:28.567 --> 02:30.267
AND WHILE I KNOW THAT
THEY LOVE ME,

02:30.267 --> 02:31.567
AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO HELP ME,

02:31.567 --> 02:35.533
I WISH THEY, YOU KNOW,
WOULDN'T DOUBT ME SO MUCH.

02:35.533 --> 02:36.767
**

02:36.767 --> 02:39.567
* AND I HEAR YOU WHISTLING *

02:39.567 --> 02:42.767
* ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WIND *

02:42.767 --> 02:44.833
-THAT'S A SONG I WROTE.
-I LOVE THAT.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.067
-YEAH, LIKE, A LOT.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.167
HAVE YOU EVER, LIKE,
THOUGHT ABOUT SONGWRITING?

02:50.167 --> 02:51.500
NO. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE

02:51.500 --> 02:53.867
I'M NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE
ENOUGH ABOUT MUSIC.

02:53.867 --> 02:56.633
GIRL, THAT'S WHAT COWRITING
IS FOR.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.667
I WAS SHOCKED HEARING JAZZ SING.
SHE'S AMAZING.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.933
SHE'S GOT SO MUCH
UNTAPPED POTENTIAL,

03:01.933 --> 03:03.167
AND I'M, LIKE,

03:03.167 --> 03:06.600
READY TO STEAL HER AND HELP HER.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.933
YOU'RE AMAZING.

03:07.933 --> 03:09.833
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
COMING UP?

03:09.833 --> 03:12.633
UM...YOU KNOW HOW
I TOLD YOU ABOUT

03:12.633 --> 03:14.567
GOING TO HYPNOTHERAPY...
-YEAH.

03:14.567 --> 03:17.533
...AND HOW I'VE DONE THAT
TO HELP WITH MY FOOD THING?

03:17.533 --> 03:20.767
AND I'M GOING TO
VISIT HER AGAIN SOON,

03:20.767 --> 03:22.200
AND I'M JUST, LIKE,
WORRIED BECAUSE

03:22.200 --> 03:23.967
I DON'T WANT TO
LET HER DOWN

03:23.967 --> 03:26.400
AND MAKE HER THINK, LIKE,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.700
Jazz: MY LAST APPOINTMENT
WITH THE HYPNOTHERAPIST

03:28.700 --> 03:32.067
DEFINITELY HELPED ME
FEEL MORE IN CONTROL OF MYSELF,

03:32.067 --> 03:34.967
BUT OVERALL, I'M GOING THROUGH
THIS YO-YO PHASE

03:34.967 --> 03:36.800
WHERE I'LL LOSE A TON OF WEIGHT

03:36.800 --> 03:38.433
AND THEN I'LL GAIN BACK
THE WEIGHT.

03:38.433 --> 03:41.533
I NEED TO BE CONSISTENT
AND CONTINUE VISITING KELI

03:41.533 --> 03:43.633
IN ORDER FOR THE HYPNOTHERAPY
TO WORK.

03:43.633 --> 03:46.333
YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH
GOING ON RIGHT NOW,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.367
THE SURGERY
AND THE WEIGHT LOSS,

03:48.367 --> 03:52.133
AND NOW POTENTIALLY DATING.
-I KNOW.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.767
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO VICTORIA AT ALL?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.767
LIKE, WHEN WE WERE TALKING
ON THE BEACH, JUST HER AND I,

03:55.767 --> 03:57.500
LIKE, I KIND OF TOLD HER.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.200
I'M LIKE, "I'D LOVE
TO HANG OUT, YOU KNOW,

03:59.200 --> 04:00.967
JUST YOU AND ME ONE TIME,"

04:00.967 --> 04:03.333
AND SHE SAID SHE'D BE
DOWN FOR IT, SO...

04:03.333 --> 04:06.433
RIGHT NOW, I DEFINITELY
LIKE VICTORIA

04:06.433 --> 04:09.400
AND I COULD SEE POTENTIAL
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.267
HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW IF
SHE'S INTERESTED

04:12.267 --> 04:14.400
OR LIKES ME OR DOESN'T LIKE ME.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.900
SO I'VE NEVER REALLY
KISSED SOMEONE, LIKE,

04:16.900 --> 04:18.367
SOMEONE THAT
I'VE LIKED-LIKED.

04:18.367 --> 04:21.867
I'VE NEVER KISS-KISSED WITH,
LIKE, FRENCH KISS, YOU KNOW,

04:21.867 --> 04:25.067
WITH, LIKE,
YOUR TONGUE IN THERE.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.733
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHERE

04:26.733 --> 04:29.433
THE WHOLE JAZZ-AND-VICTORIA
THING IS GOING,

04:29.433 --> 04:31.400
BECAUSE JAZZ HAS DONE A LOT OF
THINGS BEYOND HER YEARS,

04:31.400 --> 04:32.967
BUT THE ONE THING
SHE HASN'T EXPERIENCED

04:32.967 --> 04:35.767
IS ALL OF THE LESSONS
THAT COME WITH RELATIONSHIPS

04:35.767 --> 04:39.133
AND BEING ABLE TO GROW
AS A PERSON IN THAT WAY.

04:39.133 --> 04:41.233
DO YOU FEEL LIKE VICTORIA
WOULD BE THE TYPE OF GIRL

04:41.233 --> 04:42.233
WHO WOULD
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE?

04:42.233 --> 04:43.700
-I FEEL LIKE SHE WOULD.
-YEAH.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.067
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA --

04:45.067 --> 04:46.433
I'M GONNA HOLD BACK
AND LET HER DO IT.

04:46.433 --> 04:54.333
**

04:54.333 --> 04:56.367
-THIS IS THE PLACE.
-Michaela: THIS IS IT.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.633
OOH, PRETTY, PRETTY.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.600
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GORGEOUS.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.933
I MEAN, EVERYTHING HERE
IS GORGEOUS.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.067
-OH, MY GOD.

05:04.067 --> 05:06.600
I COULD TOTALLY SEE YOU
GOING TO A GIG IN THAT.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.667
WHEN I GO SHOPPING,
I TRY ON 800 MILLION THINGS.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.900
MM-HMM.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.900
YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT?

05:11.900 --> 05:14.267
IS THAT CAR WASH
WITH THE GUY.

05:14.267 --> 05:16.467
WE ARE JUST LIVING OUR LIVES
AS WHO WE ARE.

05:16.467 --> 05:18.700
WE LOVE OURSELVES.
WE EMBRACE WHO WE ARE.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.167
AND WE WISH THAT YOU COULD
EMBRACE US, TOO.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.500
YOU DON'T LOVE WHO YOU ARE.
YOU WERE BORN A CERTAIN WAY,

05:21.500 --> 05:23.067
AND YOU DON'T LOVE HOW
YOU WERE BORN, APPARENTLY.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.600
DON'T TELL ME IF I DON'T
LOVE MYSELF

05:24.600 --> 05:26.400
'CAUSE I KNOW WHO I LOVE,
NOT YOU.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.533
-YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU CHANGED.
-I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.567
JUST THIS WORLD,
IT SCARES ME SOMETIMES.

05:31.567 --> 05:32.867
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.433
WELL, THAT'S WHY I STARTED
THIS "BE YOU" CAMPAIGN.

05:35.433 --> 05:40.200
THE "BE YOU" CAMPAIGN IS
AN ANTIBULLYING SELF-LOVE TOUR

05:40.200 --> 05:43.567
WHERE I'M ABLE TO GO INTO
SCHOOLS, MEET KIDS,

05:43.567 --> 05:45.433
SHARE MY STORY,
AND HELP THEM TO LEARN

05:45.433 --> 05:48.200
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS BEING YOURSELF.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.733
WAIT, SO YOU SPEAK
TO, LIKE, KIDS, RIGHT?

05:51.733 --> 05:54.167
I GO INTO SCHOOLS,

05:54.167 --> 05:58.133
AND I TELL MY STORY
AND I PERFORM.

05:58.133 --> 06:01.367
-I SING. YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,

06:01.367 --> 06:03.600
THE FIRST THING THAT
I THOUGHT OF HEARING YOU SING

06:03.600 --> 06:06.367
AND MAKE UP YOUR SONGS
IN THE CAR, LIKE, I WAS LIKE,

06:06.367 --> 06:09.467
"WELL, THE 'BE YOU' TOUR
SHOULD HAVE A THEME SONG."

06:09.467 --> 06:11.333
I THINK BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE PLATFORM,

06:11.333 --> 06:12.867
AND I HAVE THE SAME PLATFORM,

06:12.867 --> 06:15.500
I FEEL LIKE IT'D BE A PERFECT
FIT TO WRITE SOME COOL, LIKE,

06:15.500 --> 06:19.900
SONG FOR THE "BE YOU" TOUR.

06:19.900 --> 06:23.400
Michaela:
I THINK JAZZ HAS SO MUCH
INCREDIBLE TALENT ALL AROUND.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.967
AND WITH HER PLATFORM OF
ADVOCACY, WHAT A BETTER FIT?

06:27.967 --> 06:30.100
OBVIOUSLY, LIKE,
NOT THE BIGGEST SINGER

06:30.100 --> 06:31.933
OR PERFORMER LIKE YOU ARE.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.067
Jazz: I'VE SPOKEN
IN FRONT OF AUDIENCES.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.833
HOWEVER SINGING IS
MUCH DIFFERENT

06:35.833 --> 06:37.933
BECAUSE YOU'RE SINGING,
NOT TALKING.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.833
THEY'RE SO RECEPTIVE...

06:39.833 --> 06:41.533
-THAT'S AWESOME.
-...AND EXCITED.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.900
BUT BEING WHO YOU ARE
IS A MESSAGE

06:43.900 --> 06:46.133
THAT I HAVE BEEN SHARING
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.400
AND I FEEL LIKE MANY KIDS
WHO ARE GETTING BULLIED,

06:48.400 --> 06:51.067
FACING INTOLERANCE
AND DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY FIT IN,

06:51.067 --> 06:53.700
NEED TO HEAR THAT IT'S OKAY
TO EXPRESS WHO YOU ARE

06:53.700 --> 06:57.667
AUTHENTICALLY WITHOUT LETTING
ANYONE ELSE TELL YOU OTHERWISE.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.367
YEAH, I HONESTLY,
I'D BE DOWN TO DO IT.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.933
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

07:01.933 --> 07:03.967
IT SOUNDS PRETTY FUN.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.067
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.667
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

07:06.667 --> 07:07.700
OKAY.

07:07.700 --> 07:15.200
**

07:15.200 --> 07:18.067
**

07:18.067 --> 07:21.267
TODAY, I HAVE A HYPNOTHERAPY
SESSION WITH KELI,

07:21.267 --> 07:23.867
AND THE LAST TIME I SAW HER
WENT REALLY WELL.

07:23.867 --> 07:25.700
-HELLO, HELLO!

07:25.700 --> 07:27.733
I'M BACK.
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

07:27.733 --> 07:29.100
I'M GOOD.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.800
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT I STOP THIS YO-YO CYCLE

07:31.800 --> 07:34.267
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET
THE SURGERY,

07:34.267 --> 07:36.567
I NEED TO NOT ONLY LOSE
THE 30 POUNDS,

07:36.567 --> 07:39.533
BUT I NEED TO MAINTAIN
MY WEIGHT AFTER THAT.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.867
SO NOW I'M, LIKE,
I'M 10 POUNDS DOWN

07:41.867 --> 07:43.800
FROM WHAT I NEED
TO GET MY SURGERY,

07:43.800 --> 07:46.133
SO I'M ONE-THIRD
OF THE WAY THERE.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.400
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.633
-THAT'S GOOD.
-THAT'S GOOD.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.933
I JUST NEED TO LOSE ANOTHER
20 MORE POUNDS...

07:50.933 --> 07:53.367
-THAT'S GOOD.
-...WHICH IS A LOT, BUT...

07:53.367 --> 07:55.867
ALL RIGHT. SO TODAY,
WE'RE GONNA SWITCH UP A BIT.

07:55.867 --> 08:00.300
SO WE'RE DOING SOME
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.500
I'M JUST
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.267
SO WE'RE GOING TO
GO INTO MY PAST LIFES...

08:07.267 --> 08:09.433
MULTIPLE LIVES
OR JUST ONE LIFE?

08:09.433 --> 08:12.067
YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD MANY,
MANY, MANY PAST LIVES.

08:12.067 --> 08:15.433
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF
THE DEEPER LEVELS OF HYPNOSIS

08:15.433 --> 08:17.800
THAT A PERSON CAN EXPERIENCE.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.633
I'M OPEN TO
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION

08:19.633 --> 08:22.533
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT
I'VE HAD PAST LIVES,

08:22.533 --> 08:26.633
AND MAYBE IT COULD UNLOCK
THE DOORS OF MY MIND OR MY PAST.

08:26.633 --> 08:28.900
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO
REVISIT A PAST LIFE

08:28.900 --> 08:30.833
THAT'S GOING TO EVALUATE
AND OFFER HEALING

08:30.833 --> 08:33.667
AS TO YOUR BINGE EATING
IN THIS LIFETIME.

08:33.667 --> 08:37.067
NOW, WITH THAT INTENTION,
THAT WILL DICTATE

08:37.067 --> 08:38.667
WHICH LIFETIME WE GO INTO,

08:38.667 --> 08:40.200
AND YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO OBSERVE.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.567
WHAT'S YOUR ROLE,
AS I ALWAYS SAY?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.400
RELAX, OBSERVE, AND REPORT.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.067
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IN THIS PROCESS.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.600
OKAY.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.867
Jazz: I'M HOPING THAT,
IN TODAY'S SESSION,

08:49.867 --> 08:51.467
WE FIND OUT WHY I BINGE EAT.

08:51.467 --> 08:54.633
AND HOPEFULLY BY
FIGURING OUT THAT PROBLEM,

08:54.633 --> 08:57.800
I COULD LOSE THE WEIGHT
AND KEEP IT OFF.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.567
TAKE A DEEP,
CLEANSING BREATH IN,

09:00.567 --> 09:05.600
AND AS YOU VERY SLOWLY
EXHALE, RELAX.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.367
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN
CONNECT SOME DOTS

09:08.367 --> 09:13.067
AS FAR AS WHAT HER PAST LIFE
EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN

09:13.067 --> 09:16.233
AND HOW IT IMPACTS
THIS LIFETIME.

09:16.233 --> 09:19.500
SO LOOK UP INTO THE SKY
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND

09:19.500 --> 09:24.300
A BIG WHITE FLUFFY CLOUD.

09:24.300 --> 09:28.067
SO I'M ASKING
THAT CLOUD TO MOVE

09:28.067 --> 09:30.233
AND CARRY YOU BACK

09:30.233 --> 09:33.100
INTO TIME AND SPACE.

09:33.100 --> 09:37.467
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
THE VERY FIRST THING

09:37.467 --> 09:40.133
THAT YOU SEE
OR THAT YOU NOTICE.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.167
I'M IN, LIKE, A TOWN CENTER.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.633
MM-HMM.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.700
PEOPLE ARE SELLING FOOD.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.700
IT'S LIKE A MARKET.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.467
OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU FEELING
OR SENSING BEING HERE?

09:58.467 --> 10:00.933
I DON'T KNOW. HUNGRY.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.733
YOU'RE HUNGRY.

10:02.733 --> 10:04.200
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

10:06.333 --> 10:10.267
-CAL.
OKAY.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THIS MARKETPLACE?

10:12.933 --> 10:15.367
DO YOU SENSE
THAT YOU LIVE NEARBY?

10:15.367 --> 10:16.633
I DON'T HAVE A HOME.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.500
YOU DON'T. OKAY.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.400
I DON'T THINK
MY FAMILY WANTS ME.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.133
WHY

10:25.667 --> 10:26.867
I'M GAY.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.067
YOU'RE GAY. OKAY.

10:29.067 --> 10:31.133
-THEY CAUGHT ME...
-MM-HMM.

10:31.133 --> 10:33.400
...WITH...

10:33.400 --> 10:34.700
A GUY.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.300
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

10:36.300 --> 10:38.767
-KICKED ME OUT.

10:38.767 --> 10:41.233
HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

10:41.233 --> 10:42.500
REJECTED.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.833
MY DREAM
WAS TO HOLD HIS HAND

10:46.833 --> 10:49.667
IN THIS MARKET.

10:49.667 --> 10:53.100
NOW I'M JUST ALONE
IN THE MARKET,

10:53.100 --> 10:54.367
AND I'M HUNGRY.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.467
I HAVEN'T EATEN.

10:56.467 --> 10:59.800
OKAY. JUST ALLOW THAT
TO COME OFF.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.400
I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.633
SO WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
THIS SCENE,

11:03.633 --> 11:06.200
AND WE'RE GOING TO DRIFT
AND FLOAT FORWARD

11:06.200 --> 11:09.533
TO THE LAST DAY OF
CAL'S LIFE.

11:09.533 --> 11:12.067
YOU'RE DRIFTING AND FLOATING,
FLOATING AND DRIFTING.

11:12.067 --> 11:15.667
AND YOU'RE THERE NOW,
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING?

11:15.667 --> 11:18.067
I'M SITTING
ON A ROCKING CHAIR.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.233
MM-HMM.

11:20.233 --> 11:24.100
I WAS NEVER ABLE TO LIVE
THE LIFE THAT I WANTED.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.633
MM-HMM.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.467
I DON'T WANNA...

11:30.467 --> 11:32.367
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.867
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT?

11:35.867 --> 11:37.633
DON'T WANNA LIVE ANYMORE.

11:37.633 --> 11:40.500
-MNH-MNH.

11:42.433 --> 11:45.533
SO WHAT WAS HE HUNGRY FOR
THAT DAY IN THE MARKET?

11:45.533 --> 11:49.533
HE WAS HUNGRY TO BE ACCEPTED.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.333
MM-HMM.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.667
HE WAS.

11:53.667 --> 11:58.667
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE
FOR JAZZ THAT CAN HELP HER?

11:58.667 --> 12:01.267
WHAT'S SHE HUNGRY FOR?

12:06.800 --> 12:10.567
SHE'S STILL HUNGRY
TO BE ACCEPTED.

12:10.567 --> 12:14.267
WHAT ADVICE CAN YOU GIVE HER?
YOU HAVE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.067
**

12:18.133 --> 12:20.933
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU
HAVE FOR JAZZ?

12:20.933 --> 12:22.833
WHAT'S SHE HUNGRY FOR?

12:25.300 --> 12:30.067
SHE'S STILL HUNGRY
TO BE ACCEPTED.

12:30.067 --> 12:34.067
WHAT ADVICE CAN YOU GIVE HER?
YOU HAVE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL.

12:34.067 --> 12:37.933
WHAT CAN YOU TELL HER?

12:37.933 --> 12:41.867
SHE'S JUST GOT
A LITTLE MIXED UP.

12:41.867 --> 12:46.533
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WITH EMOTIONS.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.967
-Keli: MM.
-WE GET MIXED UP.

12:48.967 --> 12:52.133
THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S OKAY.

12:52.133 --> 12:56.067
AND NOW YOUR SPIRIT,
YOU HAVE FULL PERSPECTIVE

12:56.067 --> 12:58.133
OF EVERYTHING
ABOUT THAT LIFETIME,

12:58.133 --> 13:00.600
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY,
AND ONLY WHEN YOU'RE READY,

13:00.600 --> 13:04.067
JAZZ, ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.700
BACK TO YOUR REGULAR WAKING
CONSCIOUSNESS, FEELING GOOD,

13:06.700 --> 13:10.700
FEELING WELL-RESTED,
FEELING WONDERFUL ALL OVER.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.300
Jazz: COMING OUT OF
THE HYPNOSIS, IT FEELS LIKE

13:15.300 --> 13:17.600
I TRAVELED THROUGH
ANOTHER LIFETIME.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.767
I WAS DEFINITELY ABLE
TO CONNECT A FEW DOTS

13:19.767 --> 13:21.767
FROM MY PAST LIFE
TO MY CURRENT LIFE

13:21.767 --> 13:24.067
BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT
OF UNDERLYING THEMES

13:24.067 --> 13:26.633
THAT ARE RELEVANT TO WHAT
I'M GOING THROUGH NOW.

13:26.633 --> 13:29.133
-WELCOME BACK.

13:29.133 --> 13:33.567
YOU DID THAT PHENOMENALLY.

13:33.567 --> 13:34.800
HOW DO YOU FEEL
COMING OUT OF THAT,

13:34.800 --> 13:38.467
AS FAR AS YOUR PERSPECTIVE
NOW ABOUT YOURSELF,

13:38.467 --> 13:41.333
AND AN ANALOGY
OF BEING HUNGRY FOR FOOD

13:41.333 --> 13:44.800
BUT ALSO HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING
ELSE IN THAT MARKETPLACE?

13:44.800 --> 13:47.733
IT WAS JUST ACCEPTANCE,
AND I KNOW HERE IN THIS WORLD,

13:47.733 --> 13:50.900
NOT EVERYONE ACCEPTS
ALL YOUR CHOICES,

13:50.900 --> 13:54.067
WHETHER THAT BE YOUR FAMILY,
SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER MET BEFORE.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.933
YEAH, AND SOMETIMES I FEEL
SELFISH FOR MAKING DECISIONS,

13:57.933 --> 14:01.400
YOU KNOW, THAT MAKE ME HAPPY,
BUT IT'S NOT SELFISH.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.733
IT'S NOT SELFISH.

14:02.733 --> 14:05.167
Keli: JAZZ PUTS A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON HERSELF,

14:05.167 --> 14:07.567
AND I THINK THAT
HER BEING ABLE TO EXPERIENCE

14:07.567 --> 14:11.967
THAT PAST LIFE ALLOWED HER TO
CONNECT THE BINGE EATING

14:11.967 --> 14:16.533
AND HER NEEDING
AND WANTING ACCEPTANCE.

14:16.533 --> 14:20.467
CAL SACRIFICED HIS WHOLE LIFE,
RIGHT, FOR ACCEPTANCE.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.267
YEAH,
AND HE COULDN'T BE HIMSELF.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.833
IT'S LIKE, NOW I'M MAKING UP
FOR, YOU KNOW,

14:24.833 --> 14:28.133
THAT PAST LIFE WHERE I WASN'T
ABLE TO BE MYSELF,

14:28.133 --> 14:29.667
AND THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.933
I SHARE A LOT OF
SIMILARITIES WITH CAL

14:32.933 --> 14:35.767
BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING
FOR THAT ACCEPTANCE

14:35.767 --> 14:37.533
BUT FACED INTOLERANCE,

14:37.533 --> 14:40.433
AND I HAVE FACED A LOT
OF THOSE STRUGGLES AS WELL,

14:40.433 --> 14:41.900
AND I TRY TO STAY STRONG.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.333
LIKE, I ALWAYS SEEM LIKE
THIS MIGHTY PERSON

14:44.333 --> 14:48.233
WHO HAS NO PROBLEMS
AND WHO'S NOT VULNERABLE AT ALL,

14:48.233 --> 14:51.467
BUT I BINGE EAT TO
MAKE MYSELF FEEL HAPPIER,

14:51.467 --> 14:55.267
AND I FEEL LIKE I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS.

14:55.267 --> 14:56.967
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:56.967 --> 15:01.233
I FINALLY FEEL EMPOWERED TO GAIN
BACK CONTROL OVER MY LIFE.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.633
-ALL RIGHT.
-IT WAS WONDERFUL.

15:02.633 --> 15:03.833
YAY.

15:03.833 --> 15:11.367
**

15:11.433 --> 15:14.367
**

15:14.367 --> 15:16.467
Greg: I HEAR
YOU'VE BEEN HYPNOTIZED.

15:16.467 --> 15:19.167
-YEAH, I'M TIRED NOW.
-TELL ME ABOUT HYPNOTHERAPY.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.167
-TELL ME ABOUT WHAT IT IS.
-DAD KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT.

15:21.167 --> 15:22.367
-LIKE...
-OH, MY GOD.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.500
WELL, TODAY WAS REALLY,
REALLY INTERESTING.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.767
WE DID
A PAST-LIFE REGRESSION.

15:28.767 --> 15:31.800
PAST

15:31.800 --> 15:34.433
YOU LOOK SKEPTICAL TO ME.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.500
Greg: JAZZ IS OPEN-MINDED,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.733
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW USEFUL
IT'S GONNA BE

15:38.733 --> 15:40.967
TO GET HER B.M.I. DOWN.

15:40.967 --> 15:44.600
SO I WENT INTO MY PAST LIFE,
AND SHE SAID, "GO BACK IN TIME.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.900
TAKE ME TO A LIFE THAT WILL
HELP ME WITH BINGE EATING."

15:47.900 --> 15:51.567
Jeanette:
I'M NOT QUITE SURE EXACTLY WHAT
PAST-LIFE REGRESSION IS.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.667
IS SHE REALLY GOING
INTO HER PAST LIFE,

15:53.667 --> 15:56.200
OR IS SHE JUST EXPLORING
THE ID

15:56.200 --> 15:59.300
OR WHATEVER IS IN THERE
DEEP WITHIN

15:59.300 --> 16:01.567
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE, AS
LONG AS SHE'S NOT BINGE EATING,

16:01.567 --> 16:02.733
I'M HAPPY.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.533
SO I GO INTO THIS LIFE,
AND I WAS A GUY,

16:04.533 --> 16:07.667
AND APPARENTLY I GOT KICKED OUT
OF MY HOME FROM MY PARENTS

16:07.667 --> 16:11.800
BECAUSE THEY CAUGHT ME SLEEPING
WITH A MAN, 'CAUSE I WAS GAY,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.700
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW, SO THEY
KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

16:14.700 --> 16:18.067
SO I CHOSE THIS PATH TO LIVE
MY LIFE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DID,

16:18.067 --> 16:21.633
AND IT ENDED UP
MAKING ME UNHAPPY.

16:21.633 --> 16:24.733
AND I THINK THAT MY LAST LIFE,
I WAS SO SELFLESS

16:24.733 --> 16:28.333
BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO PURSUE
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO,

16:28.333 --> 16:30.333
WHICH WAS BE MYSELF.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.067
HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE
TO, LIKE,

16:33.067 --> 16:35.267
WHAT YOU DO
IN THE REAL WORLD?

16:35.267 --> 16:36.800
NOW THAT
I'M STARTING TO MAKE

16:36.800 --> 16:38.567
WHAT SEEMS LIKE
SELFISH DECISIONS,

16:38.567 --> 16:40.833
I'M REALLY JUST TRYING
TO DO THINGS FOR MYSELF

16:40.833 --> 16:42.667
JUST SO I CAN BE HAPPY.

16:44.633 --> 16:47.467
WELL, LIKE, LATELY, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT VIRTUAL SCHOOL.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.633
MM-HMM.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.900
LIKE, I THINK IT WOULD
ALLEVIATE

16:49.900 --> 16:51.167
A LOT OF THE STRESS
AND PRESSURE.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.500
HOWEVER, IS THAT GONNA
HURT YOU GUYS?

16:53.500 --> 16:58.200
I NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT
TO BE A BETTER AND HAPPIER SELF.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.800
VIRTUAL SCHOOL WILL
HELP ME WITH THE CHALLENGES

17:00.800 --> 17:04.300
I'M FACING BETWEEN MY
PERSONAL LIFE AND ADVOCACY WORK.

17:04.300 --> 17:08.067
BASED ON TODAY'S SESSION, I FEEL
LIKE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

17:08.067 --> 17:11.100
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
THE TRADITIONAL PATH,

17:11.100 --> 17:13.967
BUT MY LIFE HASN'T BEEN
TRADITIONAL EVER.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.300
Jeanette: ALL RIGHT,
WELL, DAD AND I WILL DISCUSS IT.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.467
AND WE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
GIVE ME A HUG.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.067
Greg: ALTHOUGH
WE'RE PRETTY TRADITIONAL

17:19.067 --> 17:20.533
WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION,

17:20.533 --> 17:23.300
WE ALWAYS MAKE DECISIONS THAT
ARE IN OUR KIDS' BEST INTERESTS,

17:23.300 --> 17:24.667
AND JAZZ IS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

17:24.667 --> 17:25.833
SHE HAS A LOT ON HER PLATE,

17:25.833 --> 17:27.767
SO WE GOTTA THINK
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.400
Greg: DON'T WORRY.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.800
YOU KNOW, I-I...
I SEE THAT SHE'S --

17:33.800 --> 17:36.633
WELL, LET'S TALK IT THROUGH
A LITTLE BIT.

17:36.633 --> 17:37.767
SHE'S HURTING.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.733
**

17:40.800 --> 17:48.067
**

17:48.067 --> 17:51.900
IT'S SO NICE TO BE HERE
WITH YOU, ALONE ON A DATE.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.967
YOU
WHEN THE KIDS WERE LITTLE,

17:53.967 --> 17:56.100
WE GOT BABYSITTERS
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT

17:56.100 --> 17:58.233
AND WENT OUT,
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.400
AND NOW WE DO NOTHING.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.633
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
WE HAD A DATE NIGHT, GREG?

18:02.633 --> 18:07.333
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
WE HAD NO KIDS

18:07.333 --> 18:08.933
-Man: VEAL PARMESAN.
-Jeanette: THANK YOU.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.567
-Man: MY PLEASURE.
-Greg: THAT LOOKS GOOD.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.600
-OH, WHOA!
-Man: IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.067
YUMMY.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.900
SO, UM,
THE PAST-LIFE REGRESSION

18:16.900 --> 18:19.167
KIND OF THREW ME FOR A LOOP.

18:19.167 --> 18:23.567
THAT WAS VERY...INTERESTING,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

18:23.567 --> 18:28.200
SHE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
IN LIFE TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.633
-YEAH.
-AND FOOD IS NOT THE ANSWER,

18:30.633 --> 18:34.567
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DECIDE
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH SCHOOL.

18:34.567 --> 18:38.800
I WANTED MY LAST BABY TO
GRADUATE FROM A HIGH SCHOOL,

18:38.800 --> 18:42.400
NOT SOME THING IN THE AIR,
SOME VIRTUAL THING.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.700
LOOK, I THINK IT'S STILL
A BIG DECISION.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.333
I THINK
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.767
THE CHOICE WHETHER TO ALLOW JAZZ
TO DO VIRTUAL SCHOOL OR NOT

18:50.767 --> 18:52.067
IS A HARD CHOICE FOR US

18:52.067 --> 18:55.067
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE,

18:55.067 --> 18:58.067
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE STAYS ON TRACK

18:58.067 --> 19:01.733
AND THAT SHE DOESN'T
MESS UP HER FUTURE.

19:01.733 --> 19:04.500
THE FACT THAT SHE COULD
DO THIS ONLINE

19:04.500 --> 19:07.533
AND GET COLLEGE CREDITS,
ALL THAT IS GREAT.

19:07.533 --> 19:11.300
I DO FEEL THAT SHE NEEDS
TO BE SOMEWHERE.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.800
SCHOOL IS NOT
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR HER.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.967
LAST TIME WE WERE SPEAKING,

19:14.967 --> 19:17.267
WE GOT SO EMOTIONAL
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.600
I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THIS,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
AND THIS IS MY LIFE, TOO,

19:21.600 --> 19:23.800
BUT I STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S OKAY EVERY DAY,

19:23.800 --> 19:25.700
AND IT'S GONNA BE DRAINING.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.867
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.067
HAS SOMETHING -- HAS ANYTHING
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.333
LIKE, DO YOU FEEL
A LITTLE LESS EMOTION?

19:33.333 --> 19:36.067
THAT EMOTIONAL THING IS STILL
THERE. I'M PUSHING IT AWAY.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.267
I CAME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT

19:38.267 --> 19:41.333
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME
AND MY LIFE.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.867
IT'S ABOUT HER.

19:42.867 --> 19:46.467
IF JAZZ FEELS SO STRONGLY
ABOUT NOT GOING BACK TO SCHOOL,

19:46.467 --> 19:48.900
I CAN'T PHYSICALLY THROW HER
IN A CAR AND DROP HER OFF

19:48.900 --> 19:52.933
IN A PLACE SHE ABSOLUTELY HATES
TO BE WHEN SHE HAS A PLAN B.

19:52.933 --> 19:56.433
I FEEL LIKE, IF WE DON'T LET HER
DO THIS AND FIGHT IT,

19:56.433 --> 19:58.100
SHE'S JUST GONNA
BE MISERABLE.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.633
I JUST DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER
HAD JUST A STRAIGHT LINE

20:00.633 --> 20:03.100
AS IT DEALS
WITH JAZZ'S LIFE.

20:03.100 --> 20:06.867
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN CURVEBALLS,
AND WE'VE ALWAYS HAD TO ADAPT.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.567
AND SHE WANTS TO DO
MORE ADVOCACY NOW.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.533
SHE'S LIKE, "NOW I CAN
DO MORE ADVOCACY

20:11.533 --> 20:13.367
AND NOT FEEL STRESSED
OUT ABOUT IT."

20:13.367 --> 20:15.867
BUT WE NEED TO JUST COME
TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT --

20:15.867 --> 20:18.233
THAT SHE'S GONNA
HAVE TO HAVE SOMEWHAT

20:18.233 --> 20:21.667
OF A STRUCTURED
DAILY ROUTINE.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.700
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF JAZZ
GOES TO VIRTUAL SCHOOL

20:24.700 --> 20:27.633
THAT WE MAINTAIN
SOME SEMBLANCE OF STRUCTURE.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.000
THESE STUDIES NEED
TO ULTIMATELY ENABLE HER

20:30.000 --> 20:31.833
TO MOVE ON TO COLLEGE,

20:31.833 --> 20:34.033
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LAY DOWN SOME GROUND RULES,

20:34.033 --> 20:36.233
AND JAZZ IS GONNA HAVE TO AGREE
TO THOSE GROUND RULES.

20:36.233 --> 20:37.533
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
HAPPY ABOUT THAT,

20:37.533 --> 20:40.533
BUT SHE CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.

20:40.533 --> 20:43.300
YEAH.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.933
THERE'S THE PRINCIPAL
OF JAZZ'S SCHOOL.

20:45.933 --> 20:47.100
-HELLO.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.800
YEAH. MM

20:51.767 --> 21:01.433
**

21:01.433 --> 21:03.700
-WHOA. HELLO!
-Michaela: HEY!

21:03.700 --> 21:05.200
LOOK HOW COOL THIS PLACE IS.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.700
-IT'S PURPLE.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.067
I LOVE THE PURPLE.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.500
I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO WRITE AND PERFORM A SONG

21:10.500 --> 21:12.200
WITH MICHAELA FOR THIS CAMPAIGN.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.700
IT CARRIES A MESSAGE THAT
I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.333
YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT
BEING YOURSELF

21:17.333 --> 21:19.633
AND NOT LETTING THE WORLD
TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE,

21:19.633 --> 21:23.533
AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY KNOWING
THAT I'M REACHING OUT THE KIDS

21:23.533 --> 21:25.800
WHO NEED TO HEAR
THAT POSITIVE MESSAGE.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
ACTUALLY DOING THIS.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.700
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN
EVEN THOUGH, LIKE,

21:28.700 --> 21:30.900
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT
A PROFESSIONAL LIKE YOU.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.733
THE ONE THING I LEARNED WRITING
IS THAT YOU GO IN

21:33.733 --> 21:37.067
WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.067
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START?

21:38.067 --> 21:40.600
DO YOU WANT TO START
WITH THE CHORUS?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.067
SO, YEAH, I ALREADY WROTE,
LIKE, A WHOLE SONG.

21:43.067 --> 21:44.400
OH, MY GOSH.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.600
IT'S NOT THAT GREAT, BUT, LIKE,
IT'S SOMETHING

21:45.600 --> 21:48.067
WE COULD WORK WITH AND EDIT,
KIND OF JUST...

21:48.067 --> 21:49.067
THAT MAKES
EVERYBODY'S JOBS EASIER.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.433
I HAVE IT ON MY PHONE.

21:50.433 --> 21:51.733
OH, MY GOSH.

21:51.733 --> 21:52.933
SEE? YAY!

21:52.933 --> 21:55.367
SO THE SONG IS BASICALLY
ABOUT, LIKE,

21:55.367 --> 21:57.667
HOW THERE SHOULD BE A LOT
OF FREEDOM IN THIS WORLD.

21:57.667 --> 22:01.133
HOWEVER, A LOT OF US
AREN'T ABLE TO BE WHO WE ARE.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.167
HOWEVER, BREAK THOSE
STEREOTYPES, BREAK THOSE BOUNDS,

22:04.167 --> 22:06.467
AND LET YOUR FREEDOM SING,
AND JUST...

22:06.467 --> 22:09.133
* BE YOU, BE FREE *
LIKE THAT.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.133
THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

22:11.133 --> 22:12.367
WASN'T IT LIKE...

22:12.367 --> 22:13.867
* BE YOU *

22:13.867 --> 22:15.433
* BE FREE *

22:15.433 --> 22:17.067
THAT MIGHT BE
TOO HIGH FOR ME.

22:17.067 --> 22:18.167
* BE YOU *

22:18.167 --> 22:19.333
THAT'S THE NOTE I WAS
DOING IT...

22:19.333 --> 22:20.567
-OKAY.
-...TO FEEL COMFORTABLE FOR ME.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.133
* BE YOU *
PLAY A G CHORD.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.067
* BE YOU *

22:24.067 --> 22:25.933
THAT'S -- THERE IT IS,
RIGHT THERE.

22:25.933 --> 22:27.133
Michaela and Jazz:
* BE YOU *

22:27.133 --> 22:28.567
THAT'S YOUR FIRST CHORD.

22:28.567 --> 22:31.267
* BE YOU, BE FREE *

22:31.267 --> 22:32.433
AND THEN...

22:32.433 --> 22:34.133
* BE EXACTLY WHO YOU WANT
TO BE *

22:34.133 --> 22:35.333
AND THEN...

22:35.333 --> 22:37.367
* I'M ALL RIGHT WITH
BEING ME *

22:37.367 --> 22:39.733
* YEAH, YEAH *

22:39.733 --> 22:41.400
YOUR VOICE SOUNDS
FANTASTIC.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.767
-GIRL!

22:42.767 --> 22:46.133
OH, I JUST GOT A TEXT.

22:46.133 --> 22:48.433
OH, MY GOD. IT'S VICTORIA!
AAH!

22:48.433 --> 22:49.900
YOU'RE FINALLY TALKING
TO HER?

22:49.900 --> 22:53.133
YEAH. SHE SAID, "HEY,
ARE YOU FREE THIS WEEKEND?"

22:53.133 --> 22:56.167
SHE HAS SOMETHING IN MIND.
AAH!

22:56.167 --> 22:58.300
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT JAZZ
GOT THE TEXT FROM VICTORIA

22:58.300 --> 23:01.100
IN FRONT OF ME, SEEING AS,
YOU KNOW,

23:01.100 --> 23:03.700
SLIPPED VICTORIA
INTO THE WHOLE SITUATION.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.267
OH, SHE SAID,
"I'LL PICK YOU UP."

23:05.267 --> 23:06.900
SHE'S JUST, LIKE,
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.767
SHE'S LIKE, "HEY, WE'RE DOING
THIS. I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP."

23:08.767 --> 23:12.167
SO THAT FEELS DATE-Y TO ME.
IT FEELS SUPER DATE-Y TO ME.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.533
THAT'S AWESOME!

23:13.533 --> 23:15.433
NOW THAT I KNOW THAT
I'M GONNA BE HANGING OUT

23:15.433 --> 23:18.633
WITH VICTORIA AGAIN,
IT'S DEFINITELY SUPER EXCITING.

23:18.633 --> 23:19.933
AND I'M HOPING THAT SOMETHING

23:19.933 --> 23:21.733
REALLY, REALLY GOOD COMES OUT
OF THIS.

23:21.733 --> 23:25.067
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE SONGS
AND A DATE TO PLAN FOR.

23:25.067 --> 23:28.400
OH, MY GOD.
SO MUCH GOING ON.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.567
-Jazz: HEY.
-HI!

23:30.567 --> 23:33.467
I'M FEELING EXCITED,
BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

23:33.467 --> 23:37.100
LIKE, I DON'T USUALLY, LIKE,
HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN MY CAR.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.433
IS IT HOMEWORK IF YOU GO
TO VIRTUAL SCHOOL?

23:39.433 --> 23:41.900
HAVE YOU GUYS EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT YET?

23:41.900 --> 23:45.367
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.
WE THINK THAT...

23:45.367 --> 23:45.800
**

23:48.133 --> 23:51.333
**

23:53.400 --> 23:55.133
JAZZ, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

23:55.133 --> 23:56.467
OH, MY GOD.

23:56.467 --> 23:59.067
YOU LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE
GOLD DIGGERS WHO'S, LIKE,

23:59.067 --> 24:02.067
THE WIFE OF ONE OF THOSE,
LIKE, RICH RAPPERS.

24:03.867 --> 24:06.667
I'M EXCITED FOR THIS DATE
WITH VICTORIA...

24:06.667 --> 24:07.867
OH, THIS IS KIND OF COOL.

24:07.867 --> 24:10.367
I DO LIKE THAT, ESPECIALLY
WITH THE NECKLACE.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.067
...SO I AM BROWSING FOR
POTENTIAL OUTFITS,

24:13.067 --> 24:15.700
AND NOELLE AND JOJO
ARE HERE TO HELP.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.300
HOW'S THAT GOING, BY THE WAY?

24:17.300 --> 24:18.467
IT'S GOING WELL.

24:18.467 --> 24:19.833
WE'RE GONNA HANG OUT
ONE-ON-ONE.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.400
DID YOU REALLY MEAN
"HANG OUT,"

24:21.400 --> 24:23.367
OR DID YOU MEAN, LIKE,
"GO ON A DATE"?

24:23.367 --> 24:25.567
I THINK WE MUTUALLY AGREE
IT'S, LIKE, KIND OF, LIKE,

24:25.567 --> 24:27.533
A DATE BASICALLY.

24:27.533 --> 24:30.267
APPARENTLY, MICHAELA SAYS
SHE'S INTO ME, SO I DON'T KNOW.

24:30.267 --> 24:32.233
-AND YOU'RE INTO HER.
-I THINK SO.

24:32.233 --> 24:33.633
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HER
ENOUGH YET.

24:33.633 --> 24:35.433
I'M SUCH A PERSONALITY PERSON.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.500
I MEAN, I DEFINITELY
FIND HER ATTRACTIVE FOR SURE.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.433
-SHE CUTE.
-THAT'S JUST, LIKE...

24:39.433 --> 24:40.733
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF
FOREIGN TO ME

24:40.733 --> 24:42.933
'CAUSE YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT YOU
ARE INTERESTED IN GIRLS,

24:42.933 --> 24:46.233
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN
YOU BE INTERESTED IN A GIRL.

24:46.233 --> 24:49.567
IS THIS THE FIRST GIRL YOU'VE
BEEN, LIKE, ATTRACTED TO?

24:49.567 --> 24:50.733
NO.

24:50.733 --> 24:52.500
WELL, THEN LET ME
REPHRASE THE QUESTION.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.067
IS THIS THE MOST ATTRACTED
YOU'VE BEEN TO A GIRL?

24:55.067 --> 24:57.367
LIKE, THE BIGGEST CRUSH
YOU'VE HAD?

24:57.367 --> 24:59.067
UM...

24:59.067 --> 25:00.867
I MEAN, PROBABLY.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.300
-YOU GUYS HAVE CHEMISTRY.
-WE'RE FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.967
YEAH, WE REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER.
WE HAVE SIMILARITIES.

25:05.967 --> 25:09.433
I DON'T KNOW. GIRL, YOU ASKING
TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

25:09.433 --> 25:11.800
Noelle: JAZZ HAS ALWAYS TOLD ME
THAT SHE JUST WANTS

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
TO LET ROMANCE COME TO HER,

25:13.400 --> 25:15.933
BUT IT ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME
THAT SHE REJECTS ALL SIGNS

25:15.933 --> 25:18.167
OF ROMANCE
AND POTENTIAL AFFECTION.

25:18.167 --> 25:20.967
AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
WHICH IS A BIT SHOCKING,

25:20.967 --> 25:23.300
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE HAS
ACTUALLY MET SOMEONE.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.633
ROMANCE HAS COME TO HER,
AND SHE'S NOT REJECTING IT,

25:25.633 --> 25:27.833
AND WHENEVER SHE TALKS
ABOUT VICTORIA,

25:27.833 --> 25:29.567
SHE USUALLY BRIGHTENS UP
A LITTLE,

25:29.567 --> 25:32.333
AND I THINK THAT'S
REALLY SWEET TO SEE.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.400
THERE'S SO MANY TANK TOPS.
-I KNOW.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.200
I CAN'T WEAR TANK TOPS.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.567
IT'S 'CAUSE RIGHT HERE,
IT'S, LIKE...FATNESS.

25:40.567 --> 25:41.867
I DON'T KNOW.
LATELY, ESPECIALLY,

25:41.867 --> 25:45.167
MY BODY IMAGE ISSUES
HAVE BEEN KIND OF WORSE.

25:45.167 --> 25:49.067
AND IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,
IT KEEPS LOOMING, LIKE,

25:49.067 --> 25:51.367
OVER ME THAT MAYBE
VICTORIA WON'T LIKE ME

25:51.367 --> 25:53.433
BECAUSE I'M OVERWEIGHT.

25:53.433 --> 25:55.467
WHILE I DON'T HAVE
ANY EXPECTATIONS,

25:55.467 --> 25:57.667
I REALLY AM INTERESTED
IN VICTORIA,

25:57.667 --> 26:00.733
AND EVERYONE CARES A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT FINDING SOMEONE

26:00.733 --> 26:03.067
WHO YOU ARE
PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO

26:03.067 --> 26:06.600
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG COMPONENT
OF BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.500
THAT SEXUAL ATTRACTION.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.733
WHEN I ASKED HER TO HANG OUT,

26:09.733 --> 26:11.667
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CALLED IT A DATE,

26:11.667 --> 26:14.067
SO MAYBE SHE THINKS WE'RE JUST
GONNA HANG OUT AS FRIENDS.

26:14.067 --> 26:15.900
OR MAYBE SHE IS INTO ME,
SO I'M NOT SURE.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.667
SHE AGREED TO GO OUT WITH YOU
ON, LIKE, A DATE OR WHATEVER,

26:18.667 --> 26:20.733
SO I THINK
SHE'S INTO YOU, TOO.

26:20.733 --> 26:23.600
THAT IS A HOPEFUL PERSPECTIVE.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.267
YOU DO YOU.

26:25.267 --> 26:31.700
**

26:31.700 --> 26:39.933
**

26:39.933 --> 26:42.467
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

26:42.467 --> 26:44.733
UH...

26:44.733 --> 26:48.200
MOM, DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING
BIG AT THE DOOR!

26:48.200 --> 26:49.467
Greg: OH! DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

26:49.467 --> 26:52.367
-AH!
-OH, IT'S A BICYCLE.

26:52.367 --> 26:53.600
-BETTER GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.133
Jeanette: BE CAREFUL!

26:55.133 --> 26:57.467
Greg: WE ORDERED
A STATIONARY BIKE,

26:57.467 --> 26:59.067
A RECUMBENT BIKE.

26:59.067 --> 27:00.933
-I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT.

27:00.933 --> 27:04.167
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY
"RECUMBENT BIKE."

27:04.167 --> 27:06.733
WAIT, SO WHO'S IT FOR?
ALL OF US OR...

27:06.733 --> 27:10.800
I HAVE A GYM MEMBERSHIP.
HE HAS A GYM MEMBERSHIP.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.700
YOU DON'T, SO WE'RE GONNA
BRING THE GYM TO YOU.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.067
OH! YOU GUYS KNOW I LOVE
RIDING THE BIKE.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.533
WITH THE STATIONARY BIKE
IN OUR HOUSE,

27:18.533 --> 27:20.867
JAZZ HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE
NOT TO EXERCISE.

27:20.867 --> 27:24.100
SHE SHOULD BE DOWN THERE
EVERY DAY, DOING HER THING.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.700
SO I CAN JUST
WATCH TV AND BIKE?

27:26.700 --> 27:29.467
-AND DO HOMEWORK AND BIKE.
-YES.

27:29.467 --> 27:32.367
IS IT HOMEWORK IF YOU GO
TO VIRTUAL SCHOOL?

27:32.367 --> 27:34.333
HAVE YOU GUYS EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT YET?

27:34.333 --> 27:36.800
**

27:36.800 --> 27:40.400
WE THINK THAT VIRTUAL SCHOOL
IS A GOOD OPTION FOR YOU.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.600
BUT WE HAVE
A COUPLE OF THINGS...

27:44.600 --> 27:45.967
-YOU SAID "BUT."
-NO.

27:45.967 --> 27:49.200
WELL, YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TO HIBERNATE UP IN YOUR ROOM

27:49.200 --> 27:50.933
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

27:50.933 --> 27:52.767
YEAH, BUT NOW I'LL JUST BE
DOING SCHOOLWORK

27:52.767 --> 27:54.600
WHILE DOING THAT
AT THE SAME TIME.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
NOT QUITE THAT EASY.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.900
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.067
I'M SAD THAT
YOU'RE LEAVING SCHOOL,

28:00.067 --> 28:01.333
BUT I WANNA MAKE YOU HAPPY.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.500
YOU WERE MISERABLE AT SCHOOL.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.867
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO BE
A GOOD PARENT.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.133
I KNOW.

28:06.133 --> 28:09.333
HONESTLY, THIS IS
A VERY TOUGH DECISION FOR US.

28:09.333 --> 28:12.633
AS PARENTS,
JEANETTE AND I FEEL LIKE

28:12.633 --> 28:16.400
IT'S OUR PARENTAL OBLIGATION
TO DO RIGHT BY OUR KIDS,

28:16.400 --> 28:19.167
AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS
NOT GIVING YOUR KID THEIR WAY.

28:19.167 --> 28:20.933
SOMETIMES IT MEANS
LISTENING TO YOUR KID,

28:20.933 --> 28:24.100
AND WE'VE MADE WHAT WE THINK OF
AS A BIG CONCESSION.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.833
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE GREAT,

28:27.833 --> 28:30.900
SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE
TO CONCEDE CERTAIN THINGS.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.333
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU UNDERSTAND

28:32.333 --> 28:34.333
THAT YOU GOTTA DO STUFF
AROUND THE HOUSE.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.400
OF COURSE.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.433
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
A FREE-FOR-ALL.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.067
YOU GOTTA DO CHORES.

28:38.067 --> 28:40.567
YOU NEED TO BE AS HEALTHY
AS YOU COULD BE.

28:40.567 --> 28:41.900
OF COURSE.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.467
IT'LL BE BALANCED.

28:43.467 --> 28:46.433
SOME STRUCTURE,
SOME FREEDOM.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.800
OKAY.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.533
HAVING MY PARENTS' PERMISSION
TO GO TO VIRTUAL SCHOOL

28:51.533 --> 28:53.233
IS A HUGE RELIEF.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.400
THANK YOU, GUYS,

28:54.400 --> 28:55.767
JUST FOR LETTING ME DO
VIRTUAL SCHOOL, THOUGH.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.733
AND YOU GUYS REALLY ARE
THE BEST PARENTS EVER.

28:58.733 --> 29:01.167
Jazz: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
I'VE WANTED FOR A LONG TIME,

29:01.167 --> 29:03.267
AND NOW IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING,

29:03.267 --> 29:06.133
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'LL ALLEVIATE
A LOT OF MY STRESS

29:06.133 --> 29:08.233
AND ALLOW ME
TO COMPLETE MY SCHOOLING

29:08.233 --> 29:11.967
AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADVOCACY

29:11.967 --> 29:14.400
WITHOUT THAT ADDED PRESSURE.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.867
I GOT A CHORE FOR YOU.
YOU MIND?

29:15.867 --> 29:18.100
-PUT YOUR BIKE TOGETHER.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.500
OHH.
DUNCAN, WILL YOU HELP ME?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.633
**

29:22.633 --> 29:23.800
-THANK YOU.
-Man: WELCOME.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.333
Jazz: I DEFINITELY THINK
VICTORIA IS PRETTY,

29:26.333 --> 29:28.900
AND I HOPE SHE THINKS
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.533
BUT, LIKE, I HAVE TO LOSE
30 POUNDS FOR THE SURGERY.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.133
SO WHAT'S THE SURGERY FOR?

29:33.133 --> 29:35.833
UM...

29:35.833 --> 29:38.067
THE GENDER CONFIRMATION
SURGERY.

29:38.067 --> 29:38.367
**

29:41.100 --> 29:48.300
**

29:48.300 --> 29:49.733
Jazz: HEY, GIRLY!

29:49.733 --> 29:51.400
HEY! HOW ARE YOU?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.067
I'M OKAY, A LITTLE NERVOUS.

29:53.067 --> 29:55.433
Jazz: I'M FEELING
BOTH EXCITED AND ANXIOUS

29:55.433 --> 29:57.133
TO PERFORM THIS SONG.

29:57.133 --> 30:00.067
IT'S IMPORTANT, AND IT'S GONNA
HELP PEOPLE OUT THERE.

30:00.067 --> 30:01.733
LET'S GET READY.

30:01.733 --> 30:05.700
-START WARMING UP!

30:05.700 --> 30:09.067
BUT IT'S SOMETHING NEW
AND DIFFERENT FOR ME,

30:09.067 --> 30:11.300
SO I HAVE THAT ANXIETY.

30:11.300 --> 30:18.100
**

30:18.100 --> 30:19.600
-HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
-HEY.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.100
Greg: YOU KNOW,
IT'S INTERESTING.

30:21.100 --> 30:25.800
AS A PARENT, I THINK ANY TIME
YOU WATCH YOUR KID DO ANYTHING,

30:25.800 --> 30:29.133
THERE'S A CERTAIN SENSE
OF ANXIOUSNESS.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.900
**

30:30.900 --> 30:33.833
I'VE GOT A VERY DEAR FRIEND

30:33.833 --> 30:37.467
WHO STARTED WRITING THIS SONG

30:37.467 --> 30:40.867
THAT I THOUGHT
WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

30:40.867 --> 30:44.200
FOR WHAT THE "BE YOU" CAMPAIGN
IS ALL ABOUT.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.833
GIVE IT UP FOR JAZZ JENNINGS.

30:54.367 --> 30:55.767
JAZZ, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

30:55.767 --> 30:58.867
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE
HOW THE INSPIRATION

30:58.867 --> 31:02.067
FOR US DOING THIS CAME ABOUT.

31:02.067 --> 31:06.400
WELL, AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW,
I AM TRANSGENDER,

31:06.400 --> 31:11.367
WHICH MEANS I WAS BORN INTO
THE WRONG BODY.

31:11.367 --> 31:13.533
AND I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH MYSELF

31:13.533 --> 31:16.067
AND I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS
DIFFERENT.

31:16.067 --> 31:18.633
AND I JUST WANTED TO BE A GIRL

31:18.633 --> 31:21.700
AND LIVE MY LIFE AUTHENTICALLY
AND BE MYSELF.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.233
AND SO MANY TIMES IN SCHOOL,

31:23.233 --> 31:26.167
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TOLD THAT
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE NORMS.

31:26.167 --> 31:30.067
WE HAVE TO JUST DO WHAT EVERYONE
ELSE DOES, BUT I DISAGREE.

31:30.067 --> 31:33.467
I THINK YOU COULD JUST
ALWAYS LOVE WHO YOU ARE,

31:33.467 --> 31:35.200
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS SONG EMBODIES.

31:35.200 --> 31:39.133
-IT'S ABOUT BEING YOU.
-WE HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.767
OH, YEAH!

31:41.767 --> 31:46.100
* WE LIVE IN A WORLD
WITH SO MUCH CHOICE *

31:46.100 --> 31:49.733
* WE LIVE IN A WORLD WITH
SO MUCH VOICE *

31:49.733 --> 31:52.933
* WHY IS IT THAT ENDLESSLY *

31:52.933 --> 31:56.467
* NONE OF US CAN BE
WHO WE WANT TO BE? *

31:56.467 --> 31:58.167
Both:
* BE YOU *

31:58.167 --> 31:59.433
* BE FREE *

31:59.433 --> 32:03.500
* BE EXACTLY WHO YOU WANT
TO BE *

32:03.500 --> 32:05.233
* BE YOU *

32:05.233 --> 32:07.200
* BE FREE *

32:07.200 --> 32:10.800
* AND I'M ALL RIGHT
WITH BEING ME *

32:10.800 --> 32:14.067
* YEAH, YEAH *

32:14.067 --> 32:15.367
Greg: JAZZ SOUNDS GREAT.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.967
JAZZ NEVER CEASES TO
AMAZE US AND SURPRISE US.

32:19.967 --> 32:21.367
SHE HAS SO MANY TALENTS.

32:21.367 --> 32:23.067
Jeanette: JUST LOOKING AT JAZZ
THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES LIKE,

32:23.067 --> 32:24.800
"WOW, SHE'S A SINGER!

32:24.800 --> 32:26.567
LIKE, SHE IS
AN EXCELLENT SINGER."

32:26.567 --> 32:29.967
* STAND UP STRONG
AND LOVE WHO YOU ARE *

32:29.967 --> 32:33.233
* AND THROW THAT LOVE
TO THE NEAREST STAR *

32:33.233 --> 32:34.700
JAZZ IS COOL.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.900
THE CREATIVITY CAME
FROM WHO SHE WAS.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.767
-Jacky: WHO SHE IS.

32:38.767 --> 32:43.067
FROM THE TIME THAT JAZZ EVOLVED
PUBLICLY, THIS HAS BEEN IT,

32:43.067 --> 32:46.767
AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GREAT
STEPPING-STONE ALONG THE WAY.

32:46.767 --> 32:48.333
Both: * BE YOU *

32:48.333 --> 32:49.633
* BE FREE *

32:49.633 --> 32:53.433
* BE EXACTLY WHO YOU WANT
TO BE *

32:53.433 --> 32:57.067
* YEAH, YEAH *

32:57.067 --> 33:00.267
* I LOVE BEING ME *

33:00.267 --> 33:01.800
**

33:12.733 --> 33:14.567
Jazz: FINISHING THE SONG
MEANT A LOT TO ME

33:14.567 --> 33:17.267
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO SPREAD
A POSITIVE MESSAGE

33:17.267 --> 33:19.667
TO THESE KIDS ABOUT BEING
WHO YOU ARE,

33:19.667 --> 33:21.900
AND WE ALL DO NEED
TO FIND ACCEPTANCE.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.633
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

33:23.633 --> 33:27.233
IT JUST FELT VERY POWERFUL
AND MEANINGFUL,

33:27.233 --> 33:28.733
AND IT'S DEFINITELY
GONNA BE SOMETHING

33:28.733 --> 33:30.067
THAT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.

33:30.067 --> 33:32.833
-Jack: NO, I AM AMAZED.

33:32.833 --> 33:33.967
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU MEASURE THAT.

33:33.967 --> 33:35.800
HOW DID MOZART?
WHAT DID HE COME FROM?

33:35.800 --> 33:45.800
**

33:45.800 --> 33:47.800
Greg:
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

33:47.800 --> 33:51.567
JAZZ IS GOING ON A DATE
WITH VICTORIA.

33:51.567 --> 33:53.200
SHE'S GOING ON A DATE?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING?

33:53.200 --> 33:55.433
MM-HMM. NOPE. I DON'T KNOW IF
JAZZ KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

33:55.433 --> 33:56.800
HAS JAZZ
EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT,

33:56.800 --> 33:58.467
OR HAS SHE JUST TOLD YOU
THAT THEY'RE GOING ON A DATE?

33:58.467 --> 34:01.300
NO, SHE HASN'T TALKED MUCH
ABOUT IT AT ALL.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.400
THIS IS HER FIRST DATE
WITH A GIRL, THOUGH.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.767
SHE SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE HER.

34:05.767 --> 34:08.200
IT'D BE NICE IF THIS, LIKE,
LED TO SOMETHING.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.400
SHE'S NEVER
HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.067
SHE DOESN'T GO PAST, LIKE,
THE FIRST DATE.

34:11.067 --> 34:12.267
YEAH, BUT DON'T OVERDO IT.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.100
I MEAN, LET HER
JUST LIVE HER LIFE.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.667
LET HER GO HANG OUT,
HAVE SOME FUN.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.567
-I DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO HER.
-DON'T PUT ANY PRESSURE ON HER.

34:17.567 --> 34:20.067
-I'M NOT.
-DON'T OVERANALYZE IT. DON'T --

34:20.067 --> 34:22.467
I AM NOT.
I'M SAYING THIS TO YOU.

34:22.467 --> 34:24.200
Jeanette: I KNOW THAT JAZZ
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW

34:24.200 --> 34:25.700
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
IN LOVE.

34:25.700 --> 34:29.700
AND SHE REALLY HASN'T HAD MUCH
LUCK IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT,

34:29.700 --> 34:33.067
SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY HAVE
A LITTLE ROMANCE GOING ON.

34:34.733 --> 34:36.567
Jazz: I GOT IT.

34:36.567 --> 34:39.533
-SHE GOT IT.
-OH, SHE SEEMS ANXIOUS.

34:39.533 --> 34:41.400
-HI!
-HEY.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.067
I'M FEELING EXCITED
BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS

34:46.067 --> 34:48.400
BECAUSE THIS IS MY FIRST
ONE-ON-ONE DATE

34:48.400 --> 34:50.433
THAT I'VE EVER BEEN ON
WITH A GIRL,

34:50.433 --> 34:52.200
AND IT FEELS DIFFERENT

34:52.200 --> 34:55.967
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY
LIKE VICTORIA.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.700
-MM-HMM.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.433
YOU GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS
OF APPLYING TO SCHOOL AND...

35:00.433 --> 35:01.600
FORTUNATELY, YES.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.333
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT STUDYING?

35:03.333 --> 35:05.100
-PREMED.
-Jazz: TRAUMA SURGEON.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.667
-YES, TRAUMA SURGEON.
-Jeanette: OH, MY GOODNESS.

35:06.667 --> 35:09.500
-ME, I'M DRIVING. YES.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.667
Jeanette: MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF VICTORIA WAS REALLY GOOD.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.633
SHE FELT VERY COMFORTABLE
SPEAKING TO GREG AND I,

35:13.633 --> 35:14.700
WHICH IS NICE.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.967
SHE WASN'T NERVOUS
OR JITTERY LIKE,

35:15.967 --> 35:17.200
"OH, I'M MEETING THE PARENTS."

35:17.200 --> 35:19.833
Greg: VICTORIA SEEMS LIKE
A VERY SWEET GIRL,

35:19.833 --> 35:21.800
AND JUST WATCHING JAZZ
WITH HER,

35:21.800 --> 35:26.267
I SEE THAT THERE'S THE MAKINGS
OF A GOOD FRIENDSHIP OR MORE.

35:26.267 --> 35:27.533
I DON'T KNOW.

35:27.533 --> 35:28.633
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS OFF TO TODAY?

35:28.633 --> 35:30.100
WE'RE GOING BOATING.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.567
-THAT'S NEWS TO ME.

35:31.567 --> 35:34.133
-I DIDN'T KNOW BOATING.
-Jeanette: OH, YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.800
Jeanette: I THINK IT'S
PRETTY COOL THAT VICTORIA

35:35.800 --> 35:37.500
IS TAKING JAZZ OUT ON
A BOAT RIDE.

35:37.500 --> 35:41.067
IT COULD BE VERY ROMANTIC,
LIKE A GONDOLA IN VENICE.

35:46.733 --> 35:49.300
Jazz: I'M NOT THAT SURPRISED
THAT VICTORIA DRIVES A JEEP

35:49.300 --> 35:51.633
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT FITS
HER PERSONALITY.

35:51.633 --> 35:55.067
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT COOL,
ROUGH, EDGY...

35:55.067 --> 35:56.200
I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.667
NOW I'M GIVING
PERSONALITY TRAITS TO A CAR.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.633
WAIT, SO DO PEOPLE CALL YOU
TORI, OR DO THEY CALL YOU...

36:02.633 --> 36:04.133
PEOPLE CALL ME VIC.

36:04.133 --> 36:05.733
IS IT VIK WITH A "K" OR...

36:05.733 --> 36:08.067
-NOPE, JUST VIC, JUST VIC.
-JUST VIC, LIKE, OKAY.

36:08.067 --> 36:10.133
I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS
ON CONVERSATION

36:10.133 --> 36:11.733
AND BEING PRESENT
IN THE MOMENT,

36:11.733 --> 36:14.733
BUT THIS JEEP IS REALLY,
REALLY LOUD.

36:14.733 --> 36:16.700
THIS CAR IS SO FRICKING LOUD!

36:16.700 --> 36:18.767
-I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
-IT'S OKAY.

36:18.767 --> 36:21.667
LIKE, I DON'T USUALLY, LIKE,
HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN MY CAR

36:21.667 --> 36:23.533
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, I DON'T
WANT TO BREAK YOUR EAR.

36:23.533 --> 36:26.667
-YEAH.
YEAH.

36:26.667 --> 36:31.100
**

36:31.100 --> 36:33.333
Jazz:
IT'S A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.400
I KEEP ON TELLING MYSELF THAT
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY,

36:36.400 --> 36:38.067
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME.

36:38.067 --> 36:41.267
BUT THIS DATE IS OFF
TO A BUMPY START.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.133
**

36:46.267 --> 36:50.067
**

36:50.067 --> 36:52.300
HONESTLY, JAZZ IS
A LITTLE BIT HARD TO READ.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.633
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR COLLEGE,
FOR YOUR SENIOR YEAR?

36:54.633 --> 36:56.267
I'M READY TO GO TO COLLEGE.

36:56.267 --> 36:58.867
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT
TO BE WHEN I GROW UP,

36:58.867 --> 37:00.300
WHAT I'M GOING TO STUDY.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.867
LIKE, SHE CAN BE
SUPER SARCASTIC

37:01.867 --> 37:03.367
BUT ALSO, LIKE, MEAN IT
AT THE SAME TIME,

37:03.367 --> 37:05.067
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

37:05.067 --> 37:08.533
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST GONNA DO
VOLUNTEER WORK FOREVER.

37:08.533 --> 37:10.567
BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET MONEY?

37:10.567 --> 37:12.100
I'M GOING TO MARRY
SOMEONE RICH, YAY!

37:12.100 --> 37:13.333
OKAY, GOOD PLAN, GOOD PLAN.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.233
-YES, GOOD PLAN.
-YES.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.567
SO I THINK SHE'S HAVING FUN
WITH ME, BUT ALSO, LIKE,

37:17.567 --> 37:19.867
I COULD BE SO WRONG.

37:19.867 --> 37:21.767
-WE'RE HERE. YAY.

37:21.767 --> 37:23.700
-YEP.
-YAY, NICE.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.900
I'M HAPPY THAT WE'RE GOING ON
A BOAT RIDE FOR THIS DATE

37:26.900 --> 37:28.867
BECAUSE THAT WILL GIVE US
THE OPPORTUNITY

37:28.867 --> 37:32.833
TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER
AND REALLY FOCUS ON CONVERSATION

37:32.833 --> 37:34.267
AND BEING PRESENT
IN THE MOMENT.

37:34.267 --> 37:35.567
-THANK YOU.
-Man: WELCOME.

37:35.567 --> 37:38.233
Jazz: I DEFINITELY THINK
VICTORIA IS PRETTY,

37:38.233 --> 37:39.900
AND I AM ATTRACTED TO HER,

37:39.900 --> 37:42.067
AND I HOPE SHE THINKS
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.133
OH! COMFY.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.433
-HERE WE GO, YAY!
-YAY!

37:46.433 --> 37:49.733
**

37:49.733 --> 37:52.233
THIS IS SO CUTE.
IT'S SO RELAXING.

37:52.233 --> 37:54.200
YEAH, IT IS.
YOUR PARENTS ARE SO NICE.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.933
THEY'RE REALLY CHILL,
AND YOUR MOM'S ADORABLE.

37:55.933 --> 37:58.600
I KNOW.
MY DAD'S NOT ADORABLE?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.067
HE'S, LIKE, HE LOOKS SERIOUS.

38:00.067 --> 38:03.067
LIKE, HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S, LIKE,
A NO-B.S. TYPE OF GUY.

38:03.067 --> 38:05.967
YEAH, HE CAN BE SOMETIMES.

38:05.967 --> 38:08.067
THIS IS SO NICE.
IMAGINE LIVING HERE.

38:08.067 --> 38:09.833
IF YOU GO FURTHER OUT,
THERE'S, LIKE, THE REALLY,

38:09.833 --> 38:12.733
REALLY EXPENSIVE, LIKE, BIG
MANSIONS, LIKE, ON THE WATER.

38:12.733 --> 38:14.333
-YEAH.
-OH, LOOK.

38:17.533 --> 38:19.700
Jazz: I'M SO RELIEVED
BECAUSE NOW I FEEL LIKE

38:19.700 --> 38:22.133
VICTORIA AND I ARE
FINALLY CLICKING,

38:22.133 --> 38:25.800
AND, YOU KNOW, THE CONVERSATION
IS GOING VERY SMOOTHLY.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.867
WE'RE JUST BEING OURSELVES,
BEING NATURAL AND AUTHENTIC,

38:28.867 --> 38:31.967
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS HOPING FOR.

38:31.967 --> 38:34.500
MY DREAM HOUSE IS, LIKE,
FANTASY COTTAGE

38:34.500 --> 38:37.067
IN A MYSTICAL WOODS
NEAR THE OCEAN.

38:38.700 --> 38:41.300
NO
OKAY, THAT'S JUST ME.

38:43.067 --> 38:45.900
MINE IS, LIKE, APARTMENT
WITH CONCRETE FLOORS.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.500
LIKE, REALLY INDUSTRIAL.

38:47.500 --> 38:52.333
I DON'T PLAN ON HAVING,
LIKE, KIDS EVER, SO, LIKE,

38:52.333 --> 38:54.067
I'M GOOD WITH
A STUDIO APARTMENT.

38:54.067 --> 38:55.733
YOU NEVER WANT KIDS?

38:55.733 --> 38:57.067
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

38:57.067 --> 38:58.767
LIKE, I JUST DON'T
SEE MYSELF WITH CHILDREN.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.267
MAYBE THAT WILL CHANGE
IN THE FUTURE.

39:00.267 --> 39:01.500
YOU NEVER KNOW.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.067
I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A LOT OF LOVE TO GIVE,

39:03.067 --> 39:04.900
AND I WANT TO GIVE THAT
TO KIDS, SO...

39:04.900 --> 39:06.067
THAT'S SWEET.

39:06.067 --> 39:07.833
Jazz: AS VICTORIA AND I
CONTINUE TO TALK,

39:07.833 --> 39:10.567
WE FIND OUT THAT WE'RE OPPOSITES
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

39:10.567 --> 39:12.400
AND I'M COMPLETELY FINE
WITH THAT.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.300
AND WHILE WE HAVE DIFFERENT
INTERESTS IN CERTAIN REGARDS,

39:15.300 --> 39:18.067
I THINK THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE OPPOSITES ATTRACT.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.900
I BROUGHT SOME BABY CARROTS
AND SOME RANCH,

39:19.900 --> 39:21.300
SO I'M GONNA GET THOSE OUT.

39:21.300 --> 39:22.933
I SHOULDN'T BE EATING RANCH
'CAUSE, LIKE...

39:22.933 --> 39:24.800
-'CAUSE RANCH IS UNHEALTHY.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.833
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
LOSING WEIGHT, BUT...

39:26.833 --> 39:28.233
WHY?

39:28.233 --> 39:30.867
UM...

39:30.867 --> 39:33.800
I -- WELL, LIKE, I HAVE TO LOSE
30 POUNDS FOR THE SURGERY,

39:33.800 --> 39:35.133
AND IT'S, LIKE,
REALLY STRESSFUL.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.133
THAT'S A LOT.
-30, YEAH.

39:37.133 --> 39:38.800
SO WHAT'S THE SURGERY FOR?

39:38.800 --> 39:40.367
UM...

39:40.367 --> 39:43.500
IT'S, LIKE, THE GENDER
CONFIRMATION SURGERY.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.267
IT'S CALLED DIFFERENT NAMES,
BUT BASICALLY

39:46.267 --> 39:48.500
IT'S WHEN THEY INVERT
MY GENITALS

39:48.500 --> 39:51.500
INTO A VAGINA
AND WHATEVER, ALL THAT.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.433
Jazz: I'M REALLY OPEN
WITH ALL PEOPLE.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.133
HOWEVER, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S IMPORTANT

39:55.133 --> 39:57.833
THAT I'M ESPECIALLY OPEN
WITH VICTORIA

39:57.833 --> 40:00.067
JUST BECAUSE I'M TRANSGENDER,

40:00.067 --> 40:02.333
AND WE COULD POTENTIALLY
PURSUE A RELATIONSHIP.

40:02.333 --> 40:05.100
HAVE YOU EVER DATED
SOMEONE WHO'S TRANSGENDER?

40:05.100 --> 40:06.867
NO, BUT I HAVE, LIKE...

40:06.867 --> 40:09.100
-YEAH, I HAVE FRIENDS.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.400
IS THAT WEIRD FOR YOU,
THE IDEA OF DATING A TRANSPERSON

40:12.400 --> 40:15.233
OR BEING PANSEXUAL, LIKE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER?

40:15.233 --> 40:16.900
BEING PANSEXUAL, LIKE,
LITERALLY NOTHING MATTERS.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.067
OKAY, GOOD.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.233
THE FACT THAT JAZZ
IS TRANSGENDER

40:19.233 --> 40:21.633
DOES NOT FAZE ME AT ALL
IN THE SLIGHTEST.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.733
THERE'S NO WAY OR FORM
THAT IT COULD EVER FAZE ME.

40:23.733 --> 40:25.233
I THINK THAT'S HONESTLY
JUST, LIKE,

40:25.233 --> 40:29.533
ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF HER
JUST LIKE HOW SHE HAS SIBLINGS.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.600
IT'S JUST ANOTHER FACT.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.600
DO YOU MOSTLY DATE,
LIKE, GUYS OR GIRLS?

40:33.600 --> 40:34.833
I MOSTLY DATE GIRLS.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.467
LIKE, I'LL GO ON DATES
WITH GUYS, BUT, LIKE...

40:36.467 --> 40:37.967
YOU'RE MORE ATTRACTED TO GIRLS,
YOU'RE SAYING?

40:37.967 --> 40:39.800
I'M, LIKE, MORE MENTALLY
ATTRACTED TO GIRLS,

40:39.800 --> 40:41.067
-SO THAT'S...
-OH, MY GOD.

40:41.067 --> 40:42.733
THAT'S WHAT I SAY, TOO.

40:42.733 --> 40:45.333
I'M LIKE, "I'M PHYSICALLY
ATTRACTED TO GUYS

40:45.333 --> 40:46.533
"PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE,

40:46.533 --> 40:48.033
BUT I'M MORE EMOTIONALLY
ATTRACTED TO GIRLS."

40:48.033 --> 40:49.733
OH, NO, I'M DEFINITELY MORE
PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO GIRLS,

40:49.733 --> 40:51.433
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

40:51.433 --> 40:54.700
**

40:54.700 --> 40:57.167
Jazz: I JUST --
I LIKE BEING AROUND HER.

40:57.167 --> 41:01.100
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THAT
MUTUAL ATTRACTION IS PRESENT.

41:02.867 --> 41:04.667
Victoria: I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
HANGING OUT WITH JAZZ AGAIN.

41:04.667 --> 41:08.733
MAYBE THERE'S A PARTY COMING UP
THAT WE COULD GO TO...

41:08.733 --> 41:10.767
PERHAPS.

41:10.767 --> 41:12.733
Jazz: THIS DATE
HONESTLY WENT BETTER

41:12.733 --> 41:14.867
THAN ANYTHING THAT
I COULD'VE HOPED FOR.

41:14.867 --> 41:17.300
I THINK WE BOTH
TOOK GREAT SELFIES.

41:17.300 --> 41:21.067
Jazz: WE DIDN'T KISS OR ANYTHING
AND WE HAVEN'T OPENLY DISCUSSED,

41:21.067 --> 41:23.767
LIKE, OUR FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER OR WHATEVER.

41:23.767 --> 41:25.433
HOWEVER, I REALLY LIKE HER.

41:25.433 --> 41:27.933
-I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME.
-THAT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD.

41:27.933 --> 41:30.233
IT'D BE BAD IF YOU DIDN'T.

41:30.233 --> 41:33.533
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
THAT GOOD OF A TIME.

41:36.267 --> 41:39.133
Jazz: I REALLY HAVE HOPE FOR
THIS RELATIONSHIP.

41:39.133 --> 41:40.333
YAY.

41:40.333 --> 41:41.767
NO, FOR REAL, I DID HAVE
A GOOD TIME, THOUGH.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.633
GOOD. I'M GLAD.

41:46.133 --> 41:49.433
NEXT TIME ON THE SEASON FINALE
OF "I AM JAZZ"...

41:49.433 --> 41:51.633
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

41:51.633 --> 41:54.633
DO YOU THINK I COULD
GET A TATTOO?

41:54.633 --> 41:56.367
LET'S GIVE HER
THE GREEN LIGHT, PLEASE.

41:56.367 --> 41:58.467
NO, LET'S NOT GIVE
THE GREEN LIGHT.

41:58.467 --> 42:00.967
Jayleen:
JAZZ USUALLY DOESN'T CELEBRATE
HER BIRTHDAY DOING MUCH,

42:00.967 --> 42:02.667
SO I DO NOT THINK
JAZZ HAS ANY IDEA

42:02.667 --> 42:04.067
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TODAY.

42:04.067 --> 42:05.933
OH, MY GOD.

42:05.933 --> 42:08.367
Jazz: SINCE THE LAST TIME
I SPOKE TO DR. BOWERS,

42:08.367 --> 42:10.633
I'VE BEEN IN THIS CONSTANT
YO-YO BATTLE

42:10.633 --> 42:12.267
OF LOSING WEIGHT
AND GAINING WEIGHT.

42:12.267 --> 42:14.733
IF YOU'RE RUNNING AT
A HIGHER B.M.I. THAN WE WANT,

42:14.733 --> 42:16.100
IT'S GONNA BE PROBLEM.

42:16.100 --> 42:19.867
I CANNOT DO SURGERY
IF YOU ARE NOT PERFECT.

42:19.867 --> 42:21.733
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THIS WEDDING VOW THING.

42:21.733 --> 42:23.300
Greg: I REALLY WANT TO
SURPRISE JEANETTE

42:23.300 --> 42:24.800
FOR OUR 24th ANNIVERSARY.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.667
RIGHT NOW, SHE THINKS
WE'RE GOING TO CLUB MED

42:26.667 --> 42:28.067
TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY,

42:28.067 --> 42:30.467
BUT REALLY WE'RE RENEWING
MOM'S VOWS.

42:30.467 --> 42:31.633
-NO!
-YES!
