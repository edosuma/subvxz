I have grapes! I have grapefruit!

05:13.930 --> 05:15.130
Hey!

05:15.480 --> 05:17.600
We had a plan, Carter,
and you done goofed it.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.770
The plan's still on.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.520
The plan was for you to get me B's.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.610
I just want what's best for you.

05:24.610 --> 05:26.950
You know when the last time
I got an A was?

05:26.950 --> 05:29.110
Okay, I'll act more stupid next time.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.490
Completely moronic and idiotic.
Beyond obtuse.

05:33.290 --> 05:35.570
Yeah. Totally. That's
what I'm talking about.

05:39.580 --> 05:43.790
You making fun of me?
You're dead this time, Carter.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.800
What the...

06:16.500 --> 06:19.950
Hey! You go on now, little mutt.

06:20.670 --> 06:24.790
Go on. Go on, dog. I'll turn you
into a hot dog. Now, go on.

Thank you very much.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.700
Have a nice day. Be careful with the cars.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.650
You, too.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.480
Hey.
There you are.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.770
You're late. Again.
Come on. I wanna go to Sam's.

10:13.770 --> 10:15.860
I was practicing for my recital.

10:15.860 --> 10:18.490
I'm gonna do five pirouettes
all on my own.

10:18.490 --> 10:22.070
That's cool, Frankie.

10:22.070 --> 10:25.370
And I'm gonna dance in New York,
in Swan Lake, and be crazy famous.

10:25.370 --> 10:26.660
But I'll still talk to you.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.250
Why wouldn't you talk to me?

10:28.250 --> 10:30.570
Because famous people
are always stuck up.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.330
I am not.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.260
And I'm gonna wear my boots
to do my pirouettes.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.670
Good luck with that.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.850
Hey. You are coming, right?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.560
Yeah, sure.

10:53.110 --> 10:57.850
If you don't come and Mom has to work,
nobody will be there.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.480
You'll be great.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.150
I'll be there, Frankie.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.320
I promise.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.040
That is if I invite you.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.710
The tickets are
for very important people only.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.590
Come on, let's get in the street car.
No, we can't!

11:15.590 --> 11:19.370
You're the one who wanted to go to Sam's.
Wait, Frankie.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.040
I wanna walk.
It'll be fine. Come on.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.250
Why do you have strawberries?

11:58.250 --> 11:59.670
What are you talking about?

11:59.670 --> 12:02.380
I saw you have strawberries
in your pocket in the car.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.090
I don't have any strawberries.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.510
I saw something red and green.

12:05.510 --> 12:08.430
I don't have any strawberries
in my pocket.

12:08.430 --> 12:11.880
Well, it smeared on the chair
and you didn't wipe it up.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.020
What do you mean
you don't believe me?

12:16.020 --> 12:18.440
You're gonna fly to Paris
to dance?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.520
Not gonna happen.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.520
It will happen. I know it.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.110
You know you need to punch PigFace
in the face, right?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.870
Frankie... I don't care.
He'll bully you your whole life.

12:28.870 --> 12:31.070
I'm not gonna fight back.
I'd lose.

12:40.420 --> 12:43.720
Why are we going here again?
It's just a waste of time.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.300
Because you never know,
it could change sometimes.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.970
Maybe he's in a good mood today.
In your dreams.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.970
Hi, Mr. King.
We're here for the watch.

12:55.770 --> 13:00.650
$4 and 26, 27, 28 cents.

13:00.650 --> 13:06.820
That brings the total to $34 and 18...
No, 19 cents.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.230
Not bad, am I right?

13:08.620 --> 13:12.580
Oh, you don't even wanna know.

13:12.580 --> 13:13.830
Mr. King,

13:13.830 --> 13:17.120
we've been coming here
twice a week for a long time.

13:17.540 --> 13:20.420
You can at least take the watch out
of the "For Sale" case.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.800
Please. He meant to say please.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.520
I take it out of the case, people can't see
it. People can't see it, people can't buy it.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.430
But we're gonna buy it. Eventually.

13:30.430 --> 13:34.350
Listen, I told both of you when we
started this whole cockamamieness,

13:34.350 --> 13:37.100
that if somebody wants the watch,
I'll let you know.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.940
Give you a chance to buy it first.
Yeah, but we should have

13:39.940 --> 13:41.610
There's no buts.

13:41.610 --> 13:44.440
When I bought it from your mother,
I paid her good money.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.150
This is a business. Barely, but it is.

13:47.150 --> 13:52.330
Mr. King, I promise you'll get money.
We're at, like, $34 and 19 cents.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.530
Old.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.490
A hundred?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.420
You're not really helping your case.

14:00.420 --> 14:05.300
The point is, at this rate, you guys
will be bringing my money to the cemetery.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.170
I don't like the cemetery.

14:11.010 --> 14:15.060
Listen, a guy came in, he liked the watch.
I told him it ran slow.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.560
It doesn't run slow.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.140
My father kept it in perfect condition,
and you know that.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.600
The point is, pudding head,
he's not wearing it, is he?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.310
Oh...

14:26.940 --> 14:30.280
Mr. King, of all the people
I don't like in this world,

14:30.280 --> 14:32.030
I like you the best.

14:32.030 --> 14:34.400
You and every other woman in my life.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.950
Now, you two, get out of here.

14:36.950 --> 14:40.540
We're just gonna keep coming back.
Yeah, like a rash.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.370
See ya tomorrow.
Take care.

14:57.060 --> 15:01.560
That was a waste of time.
No, it wasn't. We added more money.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.190
Next time, it'll be less money
that we have to add.

15:04.190 --> 15:05.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:07.030 --> 15:10.360
You've been giving Mr. King
your lunch money. I know you have.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.990
Maybe I wouldn't have to
if Mom hadn't sold Dad's watch.

15:13.990 --> 15:17.370
Lots of things aren't very good in life.
Get used to it.

15:17.370 --> 15:21.530
You get used to being grounded forever
or longer when Mom finds out.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.790
I was here first.

16:04.790 --> 16:07.790
I'm older, so it doesn't matter.
I'm always first.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.460
Mom doesn't like it when you double dip.

16:09.460 --> 16:13.800
Mom's not here, so if you just shut
your mouth for once, you'll be fine.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.600
Fine. I can keep my mouth shut
so much that I'll never talk to you

16:17.600 --> 16:20.930
for all the time in all the universes
in all the world.

16:20.930 --> 16:22.840
Thank goodness.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.110

16:27.110 --> 16:29.270
Carter can't come to the phone right now.

16:29.270 --> 16:32.940
Please don't leave a message
after the beep. Beep!

16:32.950 --> 16:34.490
Just look!

16:34.490 --> 16:37.870
If you are satisfied with your message,
please press "1" or hang up.

16:37.870 --> 16:39.700
Carter, just listen to me!

16:39.700 --> 16:41.320
What?

16:43.410 --> 16:44.740
No way.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.050
I can't believe it.
How did you even get up here?

16:51.050 --> 16:52.170
You know this dog?

16:52.170 --> 16:55.010
I was trying to get him
to follow us home from school.

16:55.010 --> 16:58.260
I knew you were doing something not good.
Come on. Good boy.

16:58.260 --> 17:00.010
Come here. Good boy.

17:00.010 --> 17:02.720
He's a stray.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.640
Where did you come from?

17:06.350 --> 17:07.520
A trash can?

17:07.520 --> 17:09.890
He smells worse
than your side of the room.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.810
You're right. Let's fix it.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.690
"I love my dog as much as I love you"

17:20.200 --> 17:25.160
"But you may fade
My dog will always come through"

17:26.580 --> 17:29.960
"All the pay I need
Comes shining through his eyes"

17:29.960 --> 17:35.340
"I don't need no cold water
To make me realize"

17:35.340 --> 17:41.130
"That I love my dog
As much as I love you"

17:41.510 --> 17:46.550
"But you may fade
My dog will always come through"

17:56.570 --> 17:59.360
Carter, what are we gonna do about Mom?

17:59.360 --> 18:00.650
What about her?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.660
She's gonna freak out.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.870
You asked for a bulldog for Christmas,
and you got a stuffed animal.

18:05.870 --> 18:10.880
Which is why we're not gonna tell her.
He's just gonna stay in our room for now.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.580
Where's he gonna pee and poo?

18:13.090 --> 18:14.290
In your bed? Carter!

18:15.260 --> 18:17.290
Just until I can convince her.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.420
It's Mom. We'll never convince her.
Like, ever.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.970
Oh, crap.
Oh, no.

18:25.970 --> 18:27.260
Hey, hey!

18:27.600 --> 18:30.850
Where are my two favorite people
that help Mom out?

18:32.610 --> 18:34.190
Hey, Mom.
Hi, Mommy!

18:34.190 --> 18:37.280
You're the best mommy of all the mommies
in all the world!

18:37.280 --> 18:39.200
Definitely, you're the best.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.360
Aw...

18:40.360 --> 18:41.450
What'd you break?

18:41.450 --> 18:42.730
Nothing.

18:44.120 --> 18:48.360
So there were
four accidents today. Four!

18:48.830 --> 18:51.710
I was driving the ambulance
80 miles per hour.

18:51.710 --> 18:52.920
That's a lot, Mom.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.040
Forks on the left, hon.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.550
It will be.

18:56.550 --> 19:00.870
Here you go, Madame. Mushrooms on top. How about you,
Mr. Man. Anything exciting happen at school today?

19:02.970 --> 19:04.390
PigFace happened.

19:04.390 --> 19:05.930
Your death is about to happen.

19:05.930 --> 19:10.890
Again? That's the third time.
Okay, that's it. I'm calling the school.

19:10.890 --> 19:13.600
Don't blow this up
like you blow everything up.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.060
I'm not blowing anything up.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.400
I wanna know who this kid is.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.940
I told you, PigFace.

19:17.940 --> 19:23.770
Tell me the truth.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.860
Carter, just
You don't wanna know the truth.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.000
No.
Straight up, Carter.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.830
No.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.540
'Cause if you are,
that's nothing...

19:35.540 --> 19:36.540
Go.
To be ashamed of.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.800
Just let me help you.
No. No.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.260
Here you go. No mushrooms.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.220
Um, actually,
can I have mushrooms, please?

19:43.220 --> 19:46.930
You hate mushrooms.
But taste buds change every seven years.

19:46.930 --> 19:50.430
That's a scientific fact.
He's right. Very, very right.

19:52.770 --> 19:53.970
Mushrooms.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.060
Okay.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.320
I'm just worried about you, Carter.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.650
You're worried about everything.
That is not true.

20:01.990 --> 20:06.400
Okay, maybe that is a little bit true.
A little bit.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.820
Anyway, here you go.

20:13.370 --> 20:15.500
What is going on with you guys?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.790
Nothing.
Nothing.

20:16.790 --> 20:19.290
I feel like you're hiding
something from me.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.830
Okay. Mom, let's just calm down
and eat our food.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.670
Okay, I...

20:28.810 --> 20:32.310
I know that things have been hard,

20:32.310 --> 20:35.900
and you guys wake up in the morning
and I'm already at work,

20:35.900 --> 20:38.980
and you've been on your own a lot lately.

20:38.980 --> 20:43.150
But I just want you to know
that you can talk to me, you know?

20:43.150 --> 20:46.440
Really, I'm right here.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.580
We do talk to you, Mom.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.710
Don't worry.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.000
We love you, Mom, to the moon and back.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.710
To the moon and back.

21:13.140 --> 21:17.600
This is the Aitken Basin,
formed 4.5 billion years ago,

21:17.600 --> 21:19.190
which in dog years is a lot.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.860
My dad showed it to me
on an electron telescope

21:21.860 --> 21:23.480
at the planetarium he ran.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.440
Wanna know something more interesting?

21:25.450 --> 21:28.400
This is my favorite ballerina book.
Isn't she pretty?

21:28.820 --> 21:31.280
Hey, stop chewing on that.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.290
And this is the Nutcracker.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.580
It's about an evil rat king.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.500
Die, Rat King, die.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.670
Shh.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.040
Mom will hear you.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.000
Hey, what if we named him Michael Jordan?

21:43.010 --> 21:45.630
That's the dumbest name
for a dog I've ever heard.

21:45.630 --> 21:48.590
Okay. What about Copernicus?

21:48.590 --> 21:51.550
What is going on in your mind? No.

21:52.100 --> 21:56.810
This is my favorite, Sleeping Beauty.
There's a lot of kissing.

21:56.810 --> 21:59.100
Look,
Benjamin Franklin had a dog.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.190
He thought they were more reliable
than people.

22:01.190 --> 22:03.060
That's not very interesting.

22:03.530 --> 22:07.400
Yeah, but what about Benjamin,
as his name?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.900
Mmm... What about Benji?

22:12.120 --> 22:16.200
He does look kind of like a Benji.
He's old and new at the same time.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.450
Yeah.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.280
Good boy. Good boy.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.260
Dad would let us keep Benji.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.680
Carter...

22:42.690 --> 22:44.980
I don't wanna say goodbye to Benji.

22:47.610 --> 22:50.150
I don't like goodbye.

22:50.950 --> 22:53.320
Promise me we won't have to.

23:00.460 --> 23:03.910
Hey, I promise you, Fritter.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.370
I love you, guys.

23:09.670 --> 23:11.290
I love you too, Frankie.

23:12.930 --> 23:15.260
And now I lay me down to sleep,

23:15.260 --> 23:17.770
I pray the Lord for this dog to keep.

23:17.770 --> 23:20.730
And that I will do incredible
at my recital.

23:20.730 --> 23:25.230
And that my spelling teacher will quit
her job forever and never come back.

23:25.230 --> 23:29.890
And that Mommy
will not have to worry so much.

23:30.610 --> 23:34.400
And that I'll never have to eat
any more mushrooms as long as I live.

23:34.740 --> 23:35.940
Amen.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.610
Good night, Benji.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.550
I don't know what to do, you know?

24:01.310 --> 24:03.350
They're getting so big,
and they're so smart,

24:03.350 --> 24:05.560
and they catch on to things and...

24:06.940 --> 24:10.310
And I'm trying
to keep everything together.

24:12.030 --> 24:14.320
It's like I'm nothing but a nag.

24:14.320 --> 24:18.820
All of a sudden, I'm so serious.

24:21.160 --> 24:27.790
Every day I feel like I'm messing them up
and letting them down.

24:29.170 --> 24:33.250
I don't know how to be
in three places at once.

24:35.590 --> 24:38.890
So, feel free to give me some advice

24:38.890 --> 24:42.880
or one of your lame science jokes, or...

24:45.190 --> 24:47.720
a carton of ice cream and bingeing...

24:53.150 --> 24:56.360
'cause I could really use it.

25:51.750 --> 25:55.750
Just a quick kiss
before I go to work.

26:00.510 --> 26:02.680
Good morning, Mom.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.090
What is that?

26:05.430 --> 26:08.020
A stuffed animal.
An animatronic one.

26:08.020 --> 26:11.730
Okay. All right.
I'm on to you two.

26:11.730 --> 26:14.280
This is why you guys
were being weird last night.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.610
He's cute. Mom, look at him.

26:16.610 --> 26:19.280
You know what?
I expected Carter to lie to me

26:19.280 --> 26:21.320
because he's almost a teenager, but you?

26:21.320 --> 26:24.540
Mom, we're not lying.
We just didn't tell you yet.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.120
Where did he come from?

26:26.120 --> 26:27.960
Uh, he kind of found me.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.170
On the street, we saved him.

26:30.170 --> 26:31.620
On the street?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
No. Okay.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.710
All right, I got it.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.510
You're cute, but you are a dog
and you poop everywhere,

26:40.510 --> 26:42.890
and you mess everything up,
you chew on things,

26:42.890 --> 26:44.470
you keep us up at night.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.970
He loves you, Mommy.

26:45.970 --> 26:49.140
No. Okay? I can barely keep
the three of us afloat.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.440
It's not happening.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.220
Mom, you don't have to worry.
We'll take care of him.

26:54.610 --> 26:56.900
I don't have the money or the time.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.860
It's not happening.
I'm taking him to a shelter.

26:59.860 --> 27:03.370
They murderkill dogs there.
You can't take him there.

27:03.370 --> 27:04.780
No, they don't.
Are you kidding me?

27:04.780 --> 27:06.950
A shelter?

27:06.950 --> 27:09.540
They won't even give him three days.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.000
I won't let them hurt him.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.250
Yeah, you will. You don't care.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.000
He's a good boy,
and you won't even give him a chance.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.880
Carter, no, okay?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.510
I'm sorry... I don't...

27:21.510 --> 27:23.890
I can't take care
of one more thing right now.

27:23.890 --> 27:26.460
He's not a thing. He's Benji.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.720
You named him?

27:32.150 --> 27:35.770
I'm so sorry that you can't handle
one more thing right now,

27:35.770 --> 27:37.360
but what about us?

27:37.360 --> 27:38.980
We take care of each other,

27:38.990 --> 27:41.030
so I'm pretty sure
that we can handle a dog.

27:41.030 --> 27:44.870
Maybe he'll make things
fun around here for once.

27:44.870 --> 27:47.790
Oh, I forgot. That's not allowed, either.

27:47.790 --> 27:49.700
Carter, no... That's not fair.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.490
Just leave us alone.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.870
I don't even like that stupid dog.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.100
Carter...

28:46.430 --> 28:48.210
Mom won't let you stay.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.800
You'll wind up in a pound.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.800
Just go.

28:57.190 --> 28:58.810
Go, please.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.860
I love you, Benji.

29:48.450 --> 29:53.740
"If your heart believes in dreamin'"

29:55.120 --> 29:59.530
"There's no other place I know"

30:01.590 --> 30:08.380
"Well, life here rolls on by
Without a care for tomorrow"

30:08.380 --> 30:14.720
"Yeah, that was the life for me
That was the life for me"

30:15.350 --> 30:20.390
"How long must I travel
On this journey?"

30:21.190 --> 30:26.690
"Guess I'll count a million stars
Along the way"

30:28.490 --> 30:33.120
"And every time I start to worry"

30:33.120 --> 30:34.740
"Oh"

30:34.740 --> 30:38.120
"Something whispers in my ear"

30:38.120 --> 30:43.330
"Says the words I long to hear"

30:44.340 --> 30:46.620
"Almost home"

30:47.470 --> 30:50.420
"I'm almost home"

30:51.510 --> 30:54.300
"Might be lost and afraid"

30:54.890 --> 30:57.680
"But I'm just a dream away"

30:57.680 --> 31:00.260
"I'm almost home"

31:02.650 --> 31:09.360
"Just one more mile
And I'll be home free"

31:09.360 --> 31:15.280
"Just one more day
Is all my heart needs"

31:15.290 --> 31:18.080
"I'm gonna get there"

31:18.080 --> 31:24.160
"Yeah, I'm gonna get there someday"

31:24.790 --> 31:31.510
"Feel so cold and alone
But I'm..."

31:31.510 --> 31:36.920
"I'm almost home"

31:39.730 --> 31:43.850
"Ooh"

32:01.210 --> 32:03.460
Did you not eat lunch again?
I ate lunch.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.210
I don't.

32:06.210 --> 32:08.000
Then how come we're going to Sam's?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.500
To get my money back.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.470
If you get our money back,
how do we get Dad's watch back?

32:12.470 --> 32:15.390
Mom doesn't care.
She wouldn't let us keep Benji.

32:15.390 --> 32:18.100
Why should I care
about getting her the watch back?

32:18.100 --> 32:20.680
Because we're a family.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.310
Whatever.

32:22.310 --> 32:25.150
You're just scared
of somebody else buying it.

32:25.150 --> 32:28.400
I'm not scared. I'm realistic, Frankie.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.530
I told you she wouldn't let us keep him.

32:30.530 --> 32:33.780
You're not real or listic or whatever.
You're just chicken.

32:33.780 --> 32:37.280
You give up at everything
when not very good things happen.

32:38.740 --> 32:41.200
Mr. King, we need to talk.
Hold up.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.160
Hey, you kids, I sold the watch.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.920
You two go on back home now.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.540
Sold the watch.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.880
You sold the watch? That's not right.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.380
Y'all go on now. Go home.

32:53.380 --> 32:56.640
I'm gonna call the police
and tell them you are a lying liar.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.590
You can't sell the watch.

33:01.930 --> 33:04.430
Now, I remember being a kid.

33:04.440 --> 33:08.100
I used to tell my brother there
I was gonna beat him with a baseball bat,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.230
but I didn't really mean it.

33:10.230 --> 33:13.190
When you say
you're gonna go get the police,

33:13.950 --> 33:16.020
that's just you being a kid, right?

33:16.410 --> 33:18.480
Yeah, just talking.

33:18.950 --> 33:22.830
Good, but just in case,
y'all are gonna stick around for a while.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.540
Man, you don't need
to handle kids like that.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.460
Shh.
Let go.

33:26.460 --> 33:29.250
You don't have to do that.
Leave 'em alone!

33:29.250 --> 33:31.130
Open the safe. Fill the bag. Do it.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.630
Not until you let them kids go.
Mr. Pawn Man,

33:33.630 --> 33:36.840
put yourself in the shoes of two fellas
who would come in here wearing

33:36.840 --> 33:39.210
these ridiculous masks.
Do I look like I'm playing?

33:40.050 --> 33:41.810
Open the safe! Hurry up.

33:41.810 --> 33:42.930
Y'all calm down.

33:42.930 --> 33:45.600
Open up the safe, now!
Don't hurt them kids.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.060
Do it, before I hop that counter

33:47.060 --> 33:49.890
and slap the taste out your mouth.
Come on, hurry up!

33:50.610 --> 33:52.270
Speed it up. Come on!

33:52.280 --> 33:53.480
Comin'.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.650
You got what you came for. Now go on.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.780
Tie him up. Let's go.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.280
Move. Come on, back door.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.030
Man, wait.
Tie him up.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.910
Move! The backdoor. Go. Get out.

34:06.290 --> 34:07.870
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.700
Let us go.

34:18.630 --> 34:21.050
Y'all gonna sit here,
stay quiet for ten minutes,

34:21.050 --> 34:22.930
and then forget any of this ever happened.

34:23.470 --> 34:27.680
If you don't, me and my brother will pay
a little visit to your home. Understand?

34:31.060 --> 34:33.640
Help!
Hurry up.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.480
Over here!
Mr. King!

34:38.150 --> 34:39.560
Frankie, stop!

34:43.740 --> 34:45.240
Get up. Get up.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.860
Help! Help us!
Let us go!

34:55.050 --> 34:57.210
Get in the van.
Carter

34:57.220 --> 34:59.930
Wait. What are you doing?
They saw my face.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.260
Help! Someone, help us!
They kids.

35:02.260 --> 35:04.640
Now they've seen your face, too.
Get in the van.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.760
Please let us go.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.770
We didn't do anything.
Go on. Get in the van.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.010
Please.

35:10.730 --> 35:13.100
Help! Help!

35:53.650 --> 35:55.100
Frankie.

35:58.070 --> 35:59.270
Damn.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.440
Is that your dog?

36:03.110 --> 36:04.700
Easy!

36:04.700 --> 36:05.660
Get out the way!

36:05.660 --> 36:09.110
It's more like saving our butts.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.490
Find the phone, Titus. Hurry up.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.960
Mommy!
Get rid of it.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.080
Get it out the window, idiot.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.310
Please stop.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.720
We in too deep now, brother.
We can't do that.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.840
He's gone.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.860
Stop driving!
We can't stop!

37:20.860 --> 37:23.020
We can stop!
No, we can't!

38:16.330 --> 38:17.830
Syd, where are you taking us?

38:17.830 --> 38:20.910
Don't worry.
I got this covered, I promise.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.380
Why are you so ugly?

38:24.380 --> 38:26.210
Wanna say that again?

38:29.090 --> 38:30.930
Hey! What are you doing back there?

38:30.930 --> 38:32.630
Nothing. It's just my lunch.

38:32.970 --> 38:36.020
What is that?
Do not take your eye off of him.

38:36.020 --> 38:39.850
Don't you never call me ugly. Never!

38:45.570 --> 38:47.020
Whoa!

38:59.250 --> 39:01.740
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

39:02.130 --> 39:03.490
Tie 'em up in that back room.

39:07.550 --> 39:09.330
Hurry up.
Let me go!

39:09.680 --> 39:10.880
Hey.

39:11.180 --> 39:15.630
Double knots. Put the tarp on the van.
They ain't going anywhere.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.480
Give me your hands.

39:28.070 --> 39:29.270
Please.

39:36.370 --> 39:39.250
I'm almost done with my shift,
and I haven't heard from you guys.

39:39.250 --> 39:43.410
I know that you're mad at me,
but you have to tell me where you are.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.080
Look, I'm sorry.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.000
And I love you.

39:50.380 --> 39:53.000
So call me, okay?

40:00.230 --> 40:03.400
What'd you pick this place for?
Gives me the creeps.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.810
So nobody comes sniffing around.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.890
Checking our score.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.860
I mean with them.
I didn't sign up for no kidnapping.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.620
Let me make something real clear to you.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.410
There are people that want money from us,

40:17.410 --> 40:18.930
but we ain't got no money, do we?

40:19.250 --> 40:22.660
So they gonna break
every bone in our body instead.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.660
That what you signed up for?

40:25.670 --> 40:29.120
I don't owe those people nothing.
That's all you.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.960
Who took care of you seven years, huh?

40:34.340 --> 40:36.640
Food, clothes, all that?

40:36.640 --> 40:37.850
I was the one who figured out a way

40:37.850 --> 40:41.180
for us to keep on
even when our own parents wouldn't.

40:42.810 --> 40:44.850
What I owe, you owe.

40:52.490 --> 40:56.980
Sell all this, pay off our debt.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.400
Keep them around in case we need
a getoutofjailfree card.

41:03.370 --> 41:04.820
And then what?

41:07.130 --> 41:09.160
And then we no longer need 'em.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.350
She's cold.

42:18.070 --> 42:19.310
So what?

42:21.660 --> 42:25.280
I like this here watch.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.450
A lot.

42:27.830 --> 42:29.920
It actually reminds me
of a watch my daddy had.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.620
Give it back!

42:33.880 --> 42:37.120
Was this the reason
y'all was in the shop today?

42:40.050 --> 42:41.300
"To the man of my dreams.

42:42.100 --> 42:45.010
"I love you more than the moon
and the stars. Love, W." That's nice.

42:49.730 --> 42:51.600
Let me work this here.

42:51.610 --> 42:55.770
Your daddy run off.
Got sick and tired of you, your old mama.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.270
So she sold it. It's good riddance.

42:59.410 --> 43:03.980
But then, y'all want a little
something something to remember him by.

43:04.990 --> 43:06.900
Ain't that right, little man?

43:11.080 --> 43:12.950
Tell me how bad you want it.

43:15.750 --> 43:18.670
Come on. Tell me.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.750
It's yours, ain't it?

43:23.100 --> 43:24.710
You can take it from me.

43:30.190 --> 43:33.010
Take it. Take it.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.020
Yeah.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.390
What you scared of?

43:41.200 --> 43:43.070
You're a little coward, huh?

43:46.410 --> 43:48.150
Just like your old man.

44:45.260 --> 44:47.210
Sic, Rott! Sic him!

44:48.260 --> 44:51.170
We okay?
You, too, dumbo.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.090
Go. Go!

45:10.870 --> 45:12.070
Hey!

45:27.260 --> 45:29.130
Dumb move, dog.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.930
Where are you?

45:36.690 --> 45:38.390
Hey!

45:39.270 --> 45:40.470
Hey!

45:41.070 --> 45:42.350

45:51.490 --> 45:53.200
Day keeps getting better.

46:16.390 --> 46:17.840
Little doggie.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.150
Where you at, baby boy?

46:21.150 --> 46:23.310
Come out and play.

46:30.910 --> 46:33.530
Little doggie.

46:36.410 --> 46:38.370
Where are you?

46:48.680 --> 46:50.250
I'm gonna skin you alive.

46:50.890 --> 46:53.460
Gonna wipe that stupid grin off your face.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.300
Where you at?

47:14.370 --> 47:15.620
Benji!

47:15.620 --> 47:18.540
Come here, boy. Get this.
Please, get this.

47:18.540 --> 47:19.780
Good boy.

47:25.670 --> 47:29.620
I hate that dog!

47:31.390 --> 47:34.220
Please, Benji, hurry.
It's stuck. He can't get it.

47:34.220 --> 47:35.630
Please, Benji.
Come on!

47:43.400 --> 47:46.180
Oh, I think Rottie smells him.

47:52.990 --> 47:54.200
Get him, Rott.
No!

47:54.200 --> 47:55.660
Run, Benji, run!

47:55.660 --> 47:57.940
Don't hurt him!

47:58.410 --> 47:59.610
Run, Benji!

48:46.630 --> 48:48.790
Help! Get me out of here.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.960
Hey, who is that?

48:53.840 --> 48:55.790
What are you doing in here?

48:57.600 --> 48:59.260
Puppy, bark for me!

49:01.220 --> 49:03.560
Where'd you go, puppy? Come on, puppy.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.140
Where'd you go? I know you're out there.

49:08.270 --> 49:10.390
What are you doing out there?

49:11.440 --> 49:14.310
Come on, puppy. Come on, puppy. Come on.

49:16.740 --> 49:18.530
Hey, puppy, come on back now.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.000
What're you...

49:25.000 --> 49:26.910
Are you trying to get the lock?

49:27.380 --> 49:31.800
Come on, puppy, you can do it!
I know you can.

49:31.800 --> 49:35.630
Come on, pup. Don't leave me now.
Don't give up, puppy.

49:35.630 --> 49:40.760
Come on, baby. I know you can do it.
Come on, puppy. You almost got it. Get it.

49:40.760 --> 49:44.130
Come on, pup. Come on,
I know you can do it.

49:45.270 --> 49:48.560
Puppy, thank you! You opened the door!

49:48.560 --> 49:50.980
Yes, yes, hey. Good boy.

49:50.980 --> 49:53.480
Wait. Where's Carter and Frankie?

49:57.360 --> 49:59.570
Yes, sir. I'll keep you posted.
Yeah.

49:59.570 --> 50:01.860
Sam King

50:02.330 --> 50:03.910
Detective Lyle Burton. How you doing?

50:03.910 --> 50:08.040
Hey. Listen. You got to find the kids.
Trust me, we're gonna find them.

50:08.040 --> 50:09.130
Did you see what the guys look like?

50:09.130 --> 50:11.960
No, they were wearing
I got something.

50:11.960 --> 50:15.210
Okay. Hold on for a second, okay?
What you got

50:15.550 --> 50:17.670
I found it out back.

50:22.470 --> 50:26.680
Lord, Ms. Hughes, I'm so sorry.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.230
Ms. Hughes, I'm Detective Lyle Burton.

50:29.230 --> 50:32.400
We're gonna do everything we can

50:32.400 --> 50:34.150
It's the watch.

50:34.150 --> 50:35.570
Your husband's watch.

50:35.570 --> 50:39.730
The kids have been coming in
every day almost trying to buy it back.

50:42.950 --> 50:47.530
I told them that I sold it. I didn't know
that they'd come in here to...

51:20.740 --> 51:23.150
Hey! What...
Get him. What...

51:23.990 --> 51:26.530
That dog saved me.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.780
He got me out of the dang closet
they locked me in.

51:32.170 --> 51:34.160
We need to follow procedure, okay?

51:35.500 --> 51:38.250
I think he's trying to
tell you something.

51:52.730 --> 51:54.430
Ms. Hughes! Ms. Hughes!

51:55.360 --> 51:58.940
Stay put. Requesting backup.
I got a 212 on foot.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.820
Suspect identification?

52:00.820 --> 52:05.320
Uh, brown hair, 35 pounds, four legs.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.950
You wanna repeat that, Burton?

52:06.950 --> 52:08.320
Not especially.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.160
We're parked down there.

52:16.250 --> 52:17.840
Ms. Hughes, let me do my job.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.380
I'm following that dog.

52:19.380 --> 52:21.050
Listen, we'll find them.

52:21.050 --> 52:24.500
We will follow the dog. Just come on.
Fine. Let's go.

52:25.350 --> 52:27.680
Hey, hold up, hold up.
Sam?

52:27.680 --> 52:29.470
About to catch a heart attack.

52:29.470 --> 52:31.430
Get in the car. Let's go!

52:57.670 --> 53:01.120
Hey, hey. No, no, no, you wait.
Wait here. I got it.

53:05.220 --> 53:07.340
Must be out of my doggoned mind.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.610
The heck you sniffing around for?

53:36.670 --> 53:37.870
What you got?

53:41.170 --> 53:42.540
What

53:46.510 --> 53:49.340
Pudding

53:53.140 --> 53:54.880
Is that why you brought us here?

53:57.310 --> 53:59.600
Okay.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.930
And then you walk off. Great.

how much time I've wasted?

My kids are...

I don't wanna see you ever again. Go.

We got procedure, son.

It manifests good fortune.

56:18.540 --> 56:20.360
Thank you.
You're welcome.

56:24.670 --> 56:26.750
How much money had they saved up?

56:26.750 --> 56:29.670
It doesn't matter.
I should've given them the watch back.

56:29.670 --> 56:31.790
No, I never should have sold it.

56:33.340 --> 56:34.760
I should've done something

56:34.760 --> 56:39.720
so they didn't think that buying a watch
would make it all okay.

56:40.390 --> 56:42.590
The honest truth is, Ms. Hughes...

56:43.390 --> 56:46.970
I didn't give the watch back,
'cause I like having 'em come in.

56:48.400 --> 56:51.770
Those two, they got

56:58.330 --> 57:00.660
I got something.
It's Carter's.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.240
A traffic cop found it.

No usable prints,
but it's a starting point, locationwise.

57:27.610 --> 57:30.350
I don't think he has one.
He's a stray.

Hey, where did you come from, buddy?
Do you need a home?

57:36.490 --> 57:39.320
What are you thinking?
What if Mom finds out?

57:39.950 --> 57:42.530
I'm thinking he's lonely.

57:44.290 --> 57:46.320
What are we gonna name him?

57:46.880 --> 57:49.170
Like there's even a reason
to name him.

57:49.170 --> 57:51.000
Mom will never let us keep him.

57:54.090 --> 57:55.710
It's kind of like...

57:57.050 --> 58:01.090
when Dad got sick, Mom did, too.

58:03.390 --> 58:07.300
I miss Dad,

Nothing.

Just give me a second.
I can't just sit here any longer.

1:04:57.350 --> 1:04:59.760
This van. It was stolen two days ago.

1:04:59.770 --> 1:05:01.810
Yeah.

1:05:01.810 --> 1:05:04.300
It raced out of the quarter
down towards the river.

1:05:04.940 --> 1:05:06.900
That's right where the dog was taking us.

1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:09.190
It's just a coincidence.

1:05:09.190 --> 1:05:12.820
Listen, the house was empty.
Maybe you didn't look hard enough.

1:05:12.820 --> 1:05:15.780
You're talking as if you think
a dog is smarter than the police.

1:05:15.780 --> 1:05:17.280
I'm going back to the house.

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:19.330

1:05:21.910 --> 1:05:25.320
I don't think that dog
was following any kind of protocol.

1:05:25.790 --> 1:05:28.080
I think he was following his heart.

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:38.600
If anybody ask, I'm following the lead,
all right?

1:05:38.600 --> 1:05:43.340

at not telling the police things.

Yeah.

1:12:42.690 --> 1:12:45.470
That's why I'm taking this here cash...

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:48.640
all for me...

1:12:51.030 --> 1:12:52.230
and bailin'...

1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:57.990
so I don't never have to listen
to another thing he says...

1:12:58.410 --> 1:13:00.150
never again.

1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:05.950
Who's ugly now?

1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:14.130
Hey, my man! Can you help us out?
Have you seen these two kids?

1:13:14.130 --> 1:13:16.090
A van?
Anything out of the ordinary?

1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:20.800
No, sir, I never seen 'em.

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:25.430
Help! Help!

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:40.540
Benji.

1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:43.110
Yeah. Whether she knows it or not.

1:13:44.210 --> 1:13:48.410
Okay, I'm requesting backup.
I'm at the boatyard, right off...

1:13:50.670 --> 1:13:51.870
Hey!

1:14:39.010 --> 1:14:41.000
It's a little late, you idiot.

1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:44.930
Come on, I thought we was friends.

1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:52.640
Gotcha, slick.

1:14:53.070 --> 1:14:56.350
You got the right to pretty much nothing.

1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:19.380
Benji!

1:15:26.850 --> 1:15:28.720
Cut the rope, idiot!

1:15:38.570 --> 1:15:41.520
Don't you ever quit?

1:15:52.250 --> 1:15:54.870
Benji!

1:15:59.260 --> 1:16:01.340
You thought that dog was gonna save you?

1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:03.090
You're not going anywhere.

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:06.630
Yeah, we are.

1:16:08.430 --> 1:16:10.010
About time.

1:16:12.230 --> 1:16:15.060
Frankie, Carter!
Mommy!

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:17.100
Benji.

1:16:19.490 --> 1:16:22.860
Benji! Benji!

1:18:24.070 --> 1:18:25.560
I love you, Benji.

1:18:56.140 --> 1:18:57.340
Benji?

1:18:59.650 --> 1:19:02.770
Ben?

1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:05.520
Benji?

1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:07.490
He didn't give up.

1:19:07.490 --> 1:19:09.700
Good boy. Good boy.
Benji.

1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:12.190
I love you.
I don't have to say goodbye.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:17.740
Thank God.
Thank you.

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:21.870
Hi!

1:19:28.180 --> 1:19:29.670
Get your hands off me.

1:19:30.050 --> 1:19:32.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got him. I got him.

1:19:32.850 --> 1:19:34.050
Thank you.

1:19:36.810 --> 1:19:39.050
This is going back where it belongs.

1:19:40.350 --> 1:19:41.850
Watch your head.

1:19:50.030 --> 1:19:51.230
Hello.

1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:56.440
Did good today. Good boy.

1:19:58.910 --> 1:20:00.160
What you doing?

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:03.830
Oh, I had no idea.

1:20:04.210 --> 1:20:07.210
You're a good girl.
You're a very good girl.

1:20:07.210 --> 1:20:08.420
Thank you.

1:20:28.900 --> 1:20:30.150
Good boy.

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:35.950
I'm so glad you're back.
We're keeping him, right?

1:20:35.950 --> 1:20:38.040
I don't know.
Mom!

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:40.160
We're definitely keeping him.

1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:42.410
We're gonna bake cookies
and play dress up

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:43.790
and you can help me with ballet.

1:20:43.790 --> 1:20:46.410
Stop. You're scaring him.

1:20:55.850 --> 1:20:58.090
"I feel love"

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:01.380
"All around"

1:21:04.350 --> 1:21:06.060
"I can feel it"

1:21:08.020 --> 1:21:11.270
"Shinin' down"

1:21:12.900 --> 1:21:19.900
"It lights up the day
Like the mornin' sun"

1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:26.490
"Reachin' out and touchin' everyone"

1:21:28.340 --> 1:21:30.830
"I feel love"

1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:35.540
"All day long"

1:21:36.850 --> 1:21:38.960
"Like a promise"

1:21:40.890 --> 1:21:43.220
"Like a song"

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:48.600
"And it's feelin' good"

1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:52.690
"Like I knew it would"

1:21:52.690 --> 1:21:55.310
"Everywhere I go"

1:21:57.410 --> 1:22:00.400
"I feel love"

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:11.830
"If your heart believes in dreamin'"

1:22:13.510 --> 1:22:17.840
"There's no other place I know"

1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:26.560
"Well, life here rolls on by
Without a care for tomorrow"

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:32.890
"Yeah, that was the life for me
That was the life for me"

1:22:33.570 --> 1:22:38.610
"How long must I travel
On this journey?"

1:22:39.570 --> 1:22:45.360
"Guess I'll count a million stars
Along the way"

1:22:46.710 --> 1:22:51.630
"And every time I start to worry"

1:22:51.630 --> 1:22:52.960
"Oh"

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.550
"Something whispers in my ear"

1:22:56.550 --> 1:23:01.590
"Says the words I long to hear"

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:09.100
"Almost home I'm almost home"

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:16.030
"Might be lost and afraid
But I'm just a dream away"

1:23:16.030 --> 1:23:22.440
"I'm almost home
I'm almost home"

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.990
"Feel so cold and alone"

1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:31.410
"But I'm almost home"

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.340
"Ooh"

1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:41.180
"Just one more mile
And I'll be home free"

1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:46.930
"Just one more day
Is all my heart needs"

1:23:46.930 --> 1:23:49.890
"I'm gonna get there"

1:23:49.890 --> 1:23:55.940
"Yeah, I'm gonna get there someday"

1:23:55.940 --> 1:23:58.560
"I'm almost home"

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:02.610
"On my own"

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:09.250
"Might be lost and afraid
But I'll get there someday"

1:24:09.250 --> 1:24:15.620
"I'm almost home Almost home"

1:24:16.250 --> 1:24:22.170
"Feel so cold and alone
But I'm..." "I'm almost home"

1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:35.560
"Ooh"

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:42.650
"I'm almost home"

1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:38.750
Action.
