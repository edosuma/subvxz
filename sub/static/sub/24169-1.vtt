I've been here 17 hours.
I have to get home.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.449
-Me too, man.
-No, but I really do.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.577
Are you saying
my situation isn't also urgent?

01:17.660 --> 01:20.038
No, Ron. I'm sure you have
to get to your apartment

01:20.121 --> 01:21.456
before the asparagus people come back.

01:21.539 --> 01:25.960
They're not asparagus people, Joel.
They pronounce it "oz-para-gauze."

01:26.044 --> 01:27.629
And they are certainly not people.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.924
If they were, I wouldn't have to seal
my ears with peanut butter at night

01:31.007 --> 01:32.842
just to keep them
from infiltrating my brain.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.719
They're so intrusive.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.305
And their music...

01:38.848 --> 01:41.059
I'm thinking
this isn't your first time here.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.603
I've been captured before. Why?

01:43.686 --> 01:45.730
Have you ever found a way out?

01:46.314 --> 01:49.442
Why should I help you when you don't
even treat me like a human being?

01:49.526 --> 01:52.570
Okay. I'm sorry, Ron.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.324
I shouldn't have belittled your conflict
with the oz-para-gauze.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.493
-"Oz-para-gauze."
-I said "oz-para-gauze."

01:58.576 --> 01:59.869
We both know you didn't.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.040
Let's not talk for a minute.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
It's just my wife is going through this thing,

02:10.255 --> 02:13.967
and I have to get her
this very specific medicine

02:14.050 --> 02:15.510
because she's getting worse.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.554
What's going on with your wife?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.849
Unless you don't want to talk about it
because those creatures you mocked

02:20.932 --> 02:24.227
with your lazy pronunciation
might be listening.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.398
Actually, you may be the only person
I <i>can</i> talk to about it.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.818
[woman on PA] <i>Code Gray, Psychiatry.</i>
<i>Code Gray, Psychiatry.</i>

02:33.069 --> 02:34.237
She's undead.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.614
Really?

02:37.448 --> 02:38.658
How is that going?

02:38.741 --> 02:41.244
Honestly? Mixed.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.997
She has an intensity I love,

02:44.080 --> 02:46.624
but having to find human flesh
for her to eat...

02:48.293 --> 02:50.879
-that's been hard.
-I can imagine.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.964
We're realtors, so killing people

02:53.047 --> 02:55.758
and stuffing them into freezers
doesn't come naturally.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
That must be exhausting.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.850
Now, she's getting more aggressive.
Who knows what she might do?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.060
I can't be here anymore.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.397
I'm sorry, Joel,
but there's just no way out.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.609
And if you try,
they will just keep you here longer.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.611
-[door buzzes]
-Hello, gentlemen.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.447
-Are you ready for group?
-Doctor, I need to go home.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.533
-We both need to get out of here now, man.
-But I really do.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.454
-Me, too.
-Ron! My thing is separate.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.832
Joel, you're on a 72-hour hold.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.419
We can't let you go until you're no longer
a danger to yourself or anyone else.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.504
-Shall we, gentlemen?
-Wi--

03:34.923 --> 03:38.343
-Will there be juice?
-One box per person, Ron. Same as always.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.764
-Can I have yours?
-Then I wouldn't get one.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.643
Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.855
The soonest we could get
a Serbian exchange student is six months.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.734
In six months, your mom may be just
a rotting, indiscriminate killing machine.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.903
But probably not.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.405
We don't know. It's all good.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.034
Are you sure it has to be Serbian bile
to make the serum?

04:03.534 --> 04:06.246
Yeah, it's in the book.
Since the first outbreak was in Serbia,

04:06.329 --> 04:08.248
they're the only ones
who have built up immunity.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.791
I feel like I'm blowing this!

04:09.874 --> 04:12.710
Abby, we're trying.
What about that job message board?

04:12.794 --> 04:15.213
-Did you post on that?
-Yeah, a few hours ago.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.008
-[Abby] Here.
-[Eric] "Are you Serbian?

04:19.092 --> 04:22.720
Do you want to make a $130
just for throwing up? You know you do.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.390
Send copy of birth certificate.
No dick pics, please."

04:25.473 --> 04:28.726
Yeah, I had to add that
'cause, apparently, it wasn't obvious?

04:29.018 --> 04:31.062
But, honestly,
it just made people more creative.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.981
[loud crunching]

04:33.064 --> 04:36.818
-There's that noise. Do you hear that?
-I think it's coming from the basement.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.821
[crunching continues]

04:40.613 --> 04:41.739
Mom?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.408
[Sheila] Yes, honey?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.576
Everything all right?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.578
[Sheila] Yep. All good.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.832
-[crunching continues]
-Are you making that noise?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.251
-[Sheila] What noise?
-[crunching continues]

04:54.544 --> 04:57.588
-Maybe we should check on her.
-I really don't want to do that.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.257
She's chained up.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.759
I will bet every time
someone has said that about the undead,

05:01.843 --> 05:03.094
it has never ended well.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.512
[sighs]

05:05.596 --> 05:06.472
Okay.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.854
Mom? What are you up to?

05:12.937 --> 05:16.899
Oh, just book reading.
Any news from your dad?

05:16.983 --> 05:20.611
No, not since last night when he called
from the hospital, so...

05:21.404 --> 05:24.198
Holy shit! Are you chewing the post?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.284
Okay, here's the deal.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.581
Mommy's going a little crazy down here,
so I need to get out.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.500
And I know you're worried
I'm gonna go out there and kill somebody,

05:34.584 --> 05:38.004
but think about all the people
I haven't killed.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.631
Literally, everyone in the world,

05:40.715 --> 05:42.175
-except three people.
-[Eric] Hey, Abby?

05:42.550 --> 05:45.762
-You should come look at this!
-Yeah, okay.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.807
Look, I'm sorry, but you put me in charge,
and I'm not letting you out.

05:50.475 --> 05:54.020
And stop chewing the post.
It holds up the whole fucking house.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.064
[chain clattering]

05:59.859 --> 06:02.820
We got a hit on the job posting.
There's a Serbian gentleman in Newhall

06:02.904 --> 06:03.946
willing to vomit.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.866
Of course he's in Newhall.
Text me his address.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.243
-Tell him I'm on my way.
-Wait. I'll go with you.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.287
-Is the rest of the serum done?
-Not quite.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.707
My mom is eating the house
like a giant, manipulative termite,

06:14.791 --> 06:16.667
so you need to keep working on the cure.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.961
-I have pepper spray.
-You know, it's not a cure.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.838
It will only stop her symptoms
from progressing.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.050
And there's no way she can get
out of those chains, right?

06:25.301 --> 06:28.012
Oh, what am I doing?
Nobody asks that and lives.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.141
Joel, why don't you tell us
why you're here?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.103
I got upset and trashed someone's house.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.941
But being here
and reflecting on my actions,

06:40.024 --> 06:42.443
which were wrong and I'm sorry
and will never happen again,

06:42.527 --> 06:46.739
has made me feel
like I'm ready to rejoin society

06:46.823 --> 06:51.786
and interact with my fellow citizens
from all walks of life,

06:51.869 --> 06:54.664
be they women, men,

06:55.373 --> 07:01.087
questioning, different races,
tall or small, thin or large.

07:01.671 --> 07:06.217
They all contribute to the fabric
of this great country.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.345
Thank you.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.143
Felt like you got a little off
at the end there.

07:15.226 --> 07:19.856
-Yeah, I fucked that up.
-Ron, tell us why you've come back to us.

07:20.440 --> 07:27.113
Well... I am being harassed
by the interdimensional beings again.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.283
But something happened last week.
Tell us about that.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.370
My wife died.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.587
Oh, my God. Ron, I didn't know.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.673
She'd been sick
and wasn't getting any better.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.804
I had her at home and had just finished
making her breakfast.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
She didn't want it.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.474
She just smiled at me...

07:55.892 --> 07:58.603
and said,
"Everything's going to be okay, sweetie."

07:58.686 --> 08:00.229
And then she closed her eyes.

08:02.773 --> 08:06.527
She was here... with her beautiful smile.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.114
And then she was gone forever.

08:10.198 --> 08:15.077
I can't imagine.
I lost my wife for ten seconds,

08:15.161 --> 08:17.788
and in those seconds,
I wanted to die with her.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.590
Why do they tease us
with such tiny amounts of juice?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.884
-Who wins this game?
-Here.

08:33.387 --> 08:36.349
-Thank you.
-[quietly] Yeah, yeah.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.811
They let me go downstairs
to the morgue yesterday

08:40.895 --> 08:42.897
to see her one last time.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.526
The morgue. I've been to that morgue.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.070
She didn't look the same.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.323
That must have been so hard.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.994
Did you happen to notice if any
of the bodies had Serbian-sounding names?

08:57.370 --> 09:01.582
They usually end in the letters "I-C"
or the syllable "vich."

09:07.630 --> 09:08.548
[Sheila] Abby?

09:09.298 --> 09:12.760
Oh, shit.
She's not here, Mrs. Hammond!

09:12.843 --> 09:17.473
[Sheila] Oh? You wanna go in the yard
and have a game of catch?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.933
I can't unchain you.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.853
-[Sheila] Where did Abby go?
-Just out.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.149
[Sheila] Can you come down here
for a minute?

09:27.233 --> 09:28.484
No, thank you!

09:28.818 --> 09:30.945
[Sheila] Eric, come down here.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.825
I'm so, unable to say "no" to authority.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.369
The teenager stupidly went
below the house.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.704
Great job.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.458
You displayed genuine compassion with Ron.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.212
That shows me you're not a danger
to yourself or anyone else,

09:48.296 --> 09:50.631
-so I'm going to release you.
-Really?

09:50.715 --> 09:54.010
Whatever your problem is, we're not going
to fix it in another 48 hours.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.261
We don't fix anyone.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.805
We just put Band-aids on people
and toss them back,

09:58.097 --> 10:01.892
alone, into a cold,
cripplingly indifferent society.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.896
Totally. So, I'm gonna get my shoelaces
and run down to the basement.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.856
[sighs]

10:08.608 --> 10:10.484
-Are you okay?
-[scoffs]

10:11.277 --> 10:14.655
The only time I talk to someone healthy
is when they're saying goodbye.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.367
Well... bye.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.874
-So, where's Abby?
-She went to get bile.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.876
Oh, really? From who?

10:27.251 --> 10:28.711
Some man we found online.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.339
A man you found online?
And you let her go alone?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.883
-She took pepper spray.
-Alright man. You gotta let me outta here.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.135
-I need to make sure she's okay.
-I'm not supposed--

10:36.218 --> 10:39.430
Eric, she's 16.
Come on, you can come with me.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.514
I'll even wear handcuffs.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.974
I don't have handcuffs.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.185
My bedroom, bottom drawer.
Don't touch anything else.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.687
-Go.
-Wait, really? You have handcuffs?

10:46.771 --> 10:51.317
We recently discovered how intense sex is
if your lover orgasms while you--

10:51.400 --> 10:53.944
-How much of this do you wanna hear?
-Less than that.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.826
All right. Get these chains off
and let's find her.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.705
Okay, it's an apartment on Mountain View.
It's near the mall.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.124
Of course, in Santa Clarita,
everything's near a mall, right?

11:07.208 --> 11:09.877
So many shopping opportunities.
I talk when I'm nervous.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.462
Hang on.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.130
Uh-uh.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.550
-Huh.
-Mm.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.887
Sorry, honey.
I only wear these in a sexual context.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.182
-Oh, God. What are you gonna do?
-We're gonna go find my daughter.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.892
Will you help me pop these back in?

11:26.435 --> 11:28.521
-Don't pass out.
-Okay.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.064
No, seriously, don't pass out.

11:32.066 --> 11:32.900
Shit.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.570
[dog barking]

11:43.035 --> 11:45.746
Oh, hello.
Are you here for the Tori Amos tickets?

11:46.664 --> 11:49.250
No, your throw-up.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.878
Oh. You weren't what I was expecting.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.466
Where are my manners? I'm Goran.
Please, <i>entrez.</i>

11:58.050 --> 12:01.345
No, that's okay. I'll just take it and go.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.557
I don't have it yet.
I figured you'd want to watch me do it.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.183
No, no, you figured me wrong.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.061
Strange. I've never fingered
somebody wrong before.

12:09.145 --> 12:09.979
I said "fingered."

12:10.062 --> 12:13.149
-Goodbye.
-No! Wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.652
My sense of humor can be
a real jerk sometimes. Please, come in.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.071
I shall retire to another room at once

12:19.155 --> 12:21.407
to produce the precious nectar
of my stomach.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.242
[sighs] Awesome.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.081
[knocking]

12:35.337 --> 12:36.547
Hello.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.592
-I purchased a foot here two weeks ago.
-Yeah, sure, I remember.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.094
-How'd that work out for you?
-Excellent. Thank you.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.263
I'm looking for something very specific.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.308
I have a vagina I can sell you for 500.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.020
It's a little past its "best-use-by" date,
but it'll get 'er done.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.190
Dear God! Who comes here?

12:54.523 --> 12:56.317
Brace yourself. Mostly men.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.737
I need a fresh gallbladder,

12:59.820 --> 13:02.323
but it has to be
from someone who's Serbian.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.658
God, what are you into?

13:06.160 --> 13:09.538
I love it. Come on in.
Let's take a look around, you sick fuck.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.043
Here is your vomit, milady.
I take PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin--

13:14.126 --> 13:16.086
-I have cash.
-Oh, how very retro.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.005
I produced a bit extra,

13:18.088 --> 13:20.674
-if you'd like to top it off.
-No, I'm good.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.723
-Would you like to stay for a <i>chocolat?</i>
-Not in a million years.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.475
Maybe you'd prefer something salty, then.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.185
I can get very sweaty.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.313
I'm going.

13:35.564 --> 13:39.443
I just wanted your vomit.
Why'd you have to make it weird?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.237
Eric!

13:42.738 --> 13:43.739
I did it!

13:44.031 --> 13:47.284
Abby Hammond, taking charge,
kicking ass and...

13:47.368 --> 13:49.036
talking to nobody.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.246
Nobody's here.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.634
Oh, my God! What the fuck?
What are you doing?

14:04.593 --> 14:07.388
-I know this might seem a bit forward.
-Did you follow me home?

14:07.471 --> 14:09.682
Every day,
there are moments we let pass--

14:09.765 --> 14:12.226
-Get outta here, you creep!
-Moments that could define

14:12.309 --> 14:15.437
-the rest of our lives.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.685
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I love you and we have each other.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.813
Everything else we can figure out--
What the fuck is this?

15:01.984 --> 15:06.196
Honey! You're home.
We're a family again.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.699
Hi, Dad. Don't worry,
I've got everything under control.

15:08.782 --> 15:13.037
Really? Because through fresh eyes,
it does not look great.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.873
This man was threatening Abby.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.042
Our kitchen looks like
the inside of a shark.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.129
Well, I admit it,
it went on a little longer than necessary.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.423
And then ten minutes after that.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.468
Well, gee, that's not good.

15:27.927 --> 15:32.097
Guys, great news! The serum worked.
Sheila will never get worse than this.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.435
Joel.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.105
Bu-- Not getting worse.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.067
I mean, that's wonderful news, isn't it?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.569
-You got bile?
-I did!

15:46.612 --> 15:48.489
-From this guy.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.743

15:54.828 --> 15:57.164
Okay, I'm glad you got bile.

15:57.247 --> 16:01.335
I paid $300 for mine 'cause no one called,
but whatever.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.170
And how do we know it worked?

16:03.253 --> 16:06.590
I took samples of her tar-blood-goo.
The cells stopped deteriorating.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.717
Wanna see for yourself?
The light's better in the bathroom.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.885
Smells better, too.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.679
So, then, this is it?

16:12.596 --> 16:16.976
Sheila rage-killing a man, not for food,
in our house, in front of our daughter...

16:17.059 --> 16:18.936
that's how she's gonna be from now on?

16:25.734 --> 16:27.987
Again, not getting worse.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.322
-Yay!
-[doorbell rings]

16:30.906 --> 16:32.950
[Rick] It's Rick and Alondra!
Are you home?

16:33.033 --> 16:36.328
-Oh, crap!
-[Alondra] Your cars are in the driveway,

16:36.412 --> 16:39.581
so we know that you are,
and you're gonna realize that later,

16:39.665 --> 16:41.041
and it's going to be awkward.

16:41.125 --> 16:45.045
-God, they know us so well.
-I guess I'll answer the door.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.756
Huh.

16:49.383 --> 16:54.430
Look at that.
Not a drop of blood on my pepper mill.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.684
Hey, Rick, Alondra.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.979
A sheriff friend told Rick you destroyed
the school principal's house,

17:02.062 --> 17:05.399
and they carted you off to the hospital,
so I brought cookies.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.818
-Oh!
-We wanted to see that you're all right.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.279
I'm fine. It was a misunderstanding.

17:11.989 --> 17:16.910
I was helping him move some furniture,
and it got away from us.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.329
I don't understand.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.665
It's nice out, isn't it?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.045
I may get another hummingbird feeder
for out here.

17:26.628 --> 17:30.716
-Why are you not opening your door?
-Oh. Sheila's napping.

17:30.799 --> 17:31.759
Oh.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.512
-We'll be quiet.
-Sorry. She fell asleep in the hall.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.142
-Sheila fell asleep in the hall?
-Like, on the floor?

17:40.225 --> 17:43.520
She's just tired.
She was up late last night...

17:44.146 --> 17:48.025
baking a pie,
and it took longer than expected.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.778
Plus, our kitchen's a huge mess.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.238
Unbelievable. [chuckles]

17:54.031 --> 17:57.868
If you saw it,
you would not know how to process it.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.497
Well, I should get back.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.583
-Do you want the cookies?
-Of course.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.168
Just leave them on the porch.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.257
I had such a good day at the asylum.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.009
I'm so sorry.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.762
I helped someone.
Made me feel better about myself.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.139
And then you come home to this.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.600
It's my fault! All of it.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.644
I should never have let her out
of the basement.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.687
I'm-I'm responsible for everything.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.361
Really? No one's gonna argue that?

18:35.906 --> 18:39.368
Great stuff. Well, I'm gonna run
to the store for more cleaning supplies.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.537
And I will pay,
so don't even think about it.

18:47.084 --> 18:47.918
Okay.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.214
-So, what now?
-[door opens]

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
-We get Alondra's porch cookies.
-[door closes]

18:55.217 --> 18:58.512
I think what your dad meant was
what to do now about me

18:58.595 --> 19:01.140
since I've become extra "kill-y."

19:01.223 --> 19:02.349
I didn't say that.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.227
But you wouldn't mind
if I went back down to the basement.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.814
Well, if going to the basement until
we figure this out feels right to you,

19:08.897 --> 19:10.315
then you should go to the basement.

19:10.899 --> 19:14.403
Unless someone else has another idea
besides going to the basement.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.990
But I am hearing
the word "basement" a lot.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.409
So, that's relevant.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.624
[sighs]

19:30.002 --> 19:33.005
You've been staring at the cleaning
products for, like, a really long time.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.840
Oh. Sorry.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.051
It's okay.
There's a lot going on in this aisle.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.012
I wanted to make sure
you weren't overwhelmed.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.390
Sometimes I do feel overwhelmed.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.894
Me too. Wait.
Not just in this aisle, right?

19:46.977 --> 19:49.688
No. Everywhere.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.481
Then me too.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.819
There's just so much happening right now.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.030
And I don't always know
the right thing to do.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.365
We all just do the best we can.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.161
Except for Leslie, the cashier.
She's become a problem.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.998
But do you ever feel like your best
sometimes isn't enough?

20:08.081 --> 20:11.210
Everyone does, except Leslie.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.424
This girl I know, um, her mom's been sick,
and it's gotten worse.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.468
And I wanna help
because they're like family to me,

20:19.551 --> 20:22.179
-but I never feel like I'm doing enough.
-You are.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.806
But how can I know that, Ramona?

20:26.808 --> 20:30.312
You'd do anything for this family, right?
Guy without a name tag?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.773
Oh. Eric. And yes.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.816
Then you're doing enough.

-You have some on your shoes.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.127
So, is this how it's gonna be now?

20:54.211 --> 20:58.215
We just keep Mom in the basement
and only let her out to shower and hunt?

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
I guess for the time being.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.388
Mom wanted to take me shopping
for a dress this week.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.390
I don't think I need a dress.
I already have one.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.267
I just wanna know
if that's still happening.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.854
-When I was at the asylum--
-Don't say "asylum."

21:12.938 --> 21:15.190
It sounds like they sent you
to the 19th century.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.945
Okay. When I was at the "time-out resort,"
I had a roommate, Ron.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.657
Ron lost his wife a week ago,
and it sent him spiraling.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.409
He is never gonna see her again.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.411
At least we still have your mom.

Hey, there.
I got a half-mushroom, half-olive pizza,

21:50.517 --> 21:52.561
one shrimp cocktail, a side of spinach,

21:52.644 --> 21:55.897
and for Abby's lunch tomorrow--
I was told to say that--

21:55.981 --> 21:58.984
a meatball sandwich,
all for the amazing price of $35.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.278
Here. You can keep that.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.157

this will appear unprofessional,

-It's fine, but no.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.244
Eh...

22:09.995 --> 22:13.332
-Mom brought us food.
-She even got me a shrimp cocktail.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.917
-She's the best.
-She really is.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.421
-I hope we never have to kill her.
-Boy, me too.

-It was great.

-Thank you for my shrimp cocktail.
-Of course.

about Japopo's, I went with Machichi's.

so I brought you Goran's kidney.

-Ramona?

25:47.712 --> 25:49.381
I hope you don't mind my calling.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.883
No. No, not at all.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.844
I got your number from your rewards card.

25:54.928 --> 25:58.265
Oh, I love that thing.
The savings really add up.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.522
I was thinking about your friend
with the sick mom.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.733
Is your friend your age
with strawberry-blonde hair?

-Yeah. Abby. Why?

No. I'm as single as a hummingbird moth
at the end of June.

26:20.245 --> 26:24.582
They mate at the beginning of June.
I like science. And moths.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.544
I like science and moths, too.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.714
Really? What's your favorite moth?

26:31.589 --> 26:33.633
The emperor. Duh.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.468
I know. That was easy.

My boyfriend has zero interest in moths.
