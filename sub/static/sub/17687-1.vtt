01:56.333 --> 01:57.334
W-w-what is that?

01:58.596 --> 02:00.772
[Zoey]: That is
your ex-husband's girlfriend

02:00.816 --> 02:02.165
on a snowmobile.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.950
Yes, I can, uh,
I can see that...

02:04.994 --> 02:07.910
and why is it in my lobby?

02:09.041 --> 02:11.696
It's called a promotion, Elise,

02:11.740 --> 02:12.958
and it's just the start

02:13.002 --> 02:17.441
of some very, very exciting
new game plan.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.401
And will I be privy
to this game plan, Dan,

02:20.444 --> 02:23.273
considering the fact
that I started this company?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.927
Co-own company.

02:24.970 --> 02:28.931
I created, founded,
and built this company, Dan...

02:28.974 --> 02:30.324
before we were married.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.153
Which we co-own now...
even after the divorce.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.503
Don't you think
Drew looks fantastic

02:35.546 --> 02:36.373
on a snowmobile?

02:36.417 --> 02:37.592
Ooh, Elise,

02:37.635 --> 02:38.767
you have a call
in five minutes.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.768
Thank you.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.727
Dan...

02:42.771 --> 02:44.381
you do realize

02:44.425 --> 02:46.818
that snowmobiles are
environmentally controversial?

02:46.862 --> 02:49.517
Do you not care
about this plan at all?

02:49.560 --> 02:50.909
Well, I mean,

02:50.953 --> 02:52.607
we don't just sell
travel packages

02:52.650 --> 02:54.261
to hippies, Elise.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.914
You know,

02:55.958 --> 02:58.874
you should get yourself
a snowmobile.

03:13.671 --> 03:16.065

03:32.777 --> 03:34.518
Decision on the Goldsheim case?

03:34.562 --> 03:35.824
Better, I suspect.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.347
He's waiting for you
in the conference room.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.348
Why?

03:38.392 --> 03:39.828
I don't know.
Give me that.

03:39.871 --> 03:40.829
What does he want?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.265
I don't know.
Go. You're late.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.266

04:06.028 --> 04:07.159

04:07.203 --> 04:08.857
Nick, you work hard
around here,

04:08.900 --> 04:10.250
and we all know it.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.295
Right.
Family law.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.818
You all have families
and traditions to go home to.

04:13.862 --> 04:14.863
I've told you,

04:14.906 --> 04:17.648
you're not
the odd man out here.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.041
So, what's
with the champagne?

04:20.084 --> 04:21.652
Champagne
and candy canes!

04:21.696 --> 04:23.001
You know we're all about
the holidays around here.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.003
Yeah, I know,
hence my concern.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.048

later, huh?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.101
Sure!

04:38.321 --> 04:39.279
Yes!

04:47.156 --> 04:48.940
You're up for partner!

04:48.984 --> 04:50.638
That obvious?

04:50.681 --> 04:52.030
I've been here

04:52.074 --> 04:53.423
I know
what those candy canes mean.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.468
[chuckles]

04:55.512 --> 04:56.731
Just remember,

04:56.774 --> 04:57.906
they pick one partner
per region per year.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.212
Right, and always,
"married with a family."

05:00.256 --> 05:01.344
Always.

Hey, Ashley!
Great news, huh?

05:19.884 --> 05:21.669
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.846
And you just lied
to a senior partner.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.327

05:27.370 --> 05:28.850

Darts are great

05:55.442 --> 05:57.269
I don't have arm flab.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.228
Well, I do.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.404
Did you put that
there, Holly?

06:01.448 --> 06:02.492
Honey, no.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.580
This is what Dan does

06:03.624 --> 06:05.669

since your breakup.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.410
Please brace for it.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.498
Yes, the most miserable
time of year.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.414

Chocolates came for you.

Also, Dan wants to see you.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.551
Wait, Zoe...

06:17.594 --> 06:18.552
I thought you told him
that I was on a call?

06:18.595 --> 06:20.510
Except he's just checked
my phone lines

06:20.554 --> 06:22.382
to make sure
that was actually happening.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.600
Oh, my God,
this man!

06:23.644 --> 06:25.210
[laughs tearfully]

06:25.254 --> 06:27.430
I might not even make it
to Christmas,

06:27.474 --> 06:29.432
and it's not even December yet.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.477

06:31.782 --> 06:35.438

and think of January.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.053
Hey...
you want to see this.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.533
What?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.275
See Bradford Connelly there?

06:46.318 --> 06:48.799
I say, "What do you call him
the other 364 days of the year?

06:48.843 --> 06:50.888
He says,
"I call him, 'C'mere, boy!'"

06:50.932 --> 06:52.673
[laughing]

06:52.716 --> 06:55.023
He just learned that
he's up for partner.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
[Nick]:
He's got a candy cane, too.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.765
[Ashley]: Yup...

06:57.808 --> 06:59.680
and wait for it...

07:00.768 --> 07:04.467
Oh, please tell me
she's just weirdly overweight.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.557
Oh, honey!
Oh, yes.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.125
Nope, that is
a pregnant woman.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.169

Oh, gingerbread men!

07:11.213 --> 07:13.215
Oh, this cannot
be happening.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.259
Especially
since you said

07:14.303 --> 07:15.217
you have a girlfriend

07:15.260 --> 07:16.740
that you don't
actually have.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.395
Manage your expectations.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.136
That's all I'm saying.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.797
Ahem.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.191
Oh, Elise.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.063
How was your extra-long lunch?

07:35.106 --> 07:37.108
Delicious.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.893
How is the fix
on the email server coming?

07:38.936 --> 07:41.373
Oh, it's definitely
coming along.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.419
So, in other words,

07:43.463 --> 07:44.681
it's... not fixed.

07:45.682 --> 07:46.683
You realize

07:46.727 --> 07:48.163
that the majority
of our business

07:48.206 --> 07:49.556
is done over email,

07:49.599 --> 07:51.514
and we really need
to get this fixed, like, now.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.603
Okay, Elise, I am handling it,
thank you...

07:53.647 --> 07:54.996
and you know,

07:55.039 --> 07:57.651
while we're on the topic
of business concerns, um...

07:58.782 --> 08:00.610
I'm thinking
that it's probably a good idea

08:00.654 --> 08:03.352
that we cut back
on our charity travel packages.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.833
What?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.531
Yeah, I'm just trying
to make dollars and cents here.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.185
I'm pretty sure

08:10.228 --> 08:15.016
that Scrooge said the same thing
before the ghosts showed up.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.844
Yeah, well, it's good

08:16.887 --> 08:19.586
that Scrooge's business partner
was a ghost.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.891
You are talking

08:20.935 --> 08:23.590
about dispatching
charity outreach programs

08:23.633 --> 08:24.634

08:30.814 --> 08:32.554
I know that you have
a big heart,

08:32.599 --> 08:36.254
but we have to start thinking
about the future...

08:36.298 --> 08:37.691
otherwise,

08:37.734 --> 08:41.303
all of our opportunities
are just going to pass on by.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.309

Well, I guess
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.406
Do you work around here?

10:24.449 --> 10:25.668
I see you around quite a bit.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.714
No, I just have a thing
for the wonton soup.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.150
Sounds delicious.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.020
[cell phone rings]

10:30.064 --> 10:31.065
Oh.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.808
Ah. Work.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.157
Never ends.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.375
And I was looking forward
to our first meeting

10:37.419 --> 10:38.463
of the Christmasphobia Club.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.292
Maybe...

10:41.336 --> 10:44.382
tomorrow, you can introduce me
to that hot and sour soup?

10:44.426 --> 10:45.514
Wonton soup.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.384
Right!

10:46.428 --> 10:47.995
Even better.

10:48.038 --> 10:48.996
See you tomorrow?

10:49.039 --> 10:49.997
Sure!

10:50.040 --> 10:51.128
Great.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.443
All right, everyone,
could you gather around, please?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.185
Now, as most of you know,

11:04.228 --> 11:08.102
WKJN's Reindeer Report
a week before Christmas

11:08.145 --> 11:11.714
is the city's most-televised
moment of the year,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.673
beloved by parents
and children alike,

11:13.716 --> 11:16.937
where Santa's sleigh ride
is mapped out in glorious detail

11:16.980 --> 11:18.678
for all of us
all over the state.

11:18.721 --> 11:22.159
Well, I'd like to introduce you

11:22.203 --> 11:26.076
to the Special Reindeer Report
Weather Girl

11:26.120 --> 11:28.209
for this year.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.298
All part of our very special

11:30.341 --> 11:32.909
"Give a Gift of Travel"
Promotional, so...

11:32.953 --> 11:36.434
let's give a big congratulations
to us

11:36.478 --> 11:38.828
and to our beloved Drew!

11:39.829 --> 11:41.396
[unenthusiastic clapping]

11:41.439 --> 11:42.484
[giggles]

11:49.752 --> 11:51.319
[sighs happily]

11:53.669 --> 11:54.757
Well?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.760
You do realize
that the Reindeer Report

11:57.804 --> 12:01.111
requires an extensive knowledge
on national geography, correct?

12:01.155 --> 12:03.287
And Drew can't even find
the ladies room

12:03.331 --> 12:04.288
without using Google Maps.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.900
Well, it's all
in the teleprompter,

12:06.943 --> 12:07.944
ladies.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.686
She was
a professional car model,

12:10.730 --> 12:12.775
not a professional spokesperson.

12:12.819 --> 12:16.213
The teleprompter
can be taught, Elise.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.129
Does WKJN have any idea

12:19.173 --> 12:22.654
that she has absolutely no
professional on-air experience?

12:22.698 --> 12:25.222
I've been taking
a public speaking class.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.876
Have some faith.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.881
You must be eight reindeers
shy of a sleigh ride,

12:31.925 --> 12:33.448
my friend.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.103
The most watched local
news program of the year?

12:37.452 --> 12:40.324
And we will be ready.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.282
[giggles]

12:41.325 --> 12:43.806
I am just...

12:43.850 --> 12:45.155
I'm so happy
for you!

12:52.728 --> 12:54.861
"Happy Wednesday,
Zoey."

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
I'm not Zoey.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.865
Ooh, I am!

13:05.349 --> 13:06.786
You okay?

13:06.829 --> 13:08.918
No, I'm not.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.746
He won't sell to me.
I won't sell to him.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.139
We agree on nothing
except for the fact

13:12.182 --> 13:13.793
that we both want this business.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.404
He's not even consulting me
anymore, Holly.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.666
How do I even fight that?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.886
It's not war, El.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.931
This is dirty pool.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.106
You need more than work now.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.368
[sighs]

13:24.412 --> 13:27.807
Please don't push me
into dating right now.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.112
Hon...

13:29.156 --> 13:30.766
you need something
to look forward to again.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.204
That scares me even more.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.995
[♪♪♪]

13:49.393 --> 13:50.655
[Nick]: I'm so sorry.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.874
I didn't have your number,

13:51.918 --> 13:53.571
nor the ability to abandon
a conference call

13:53.615 --> 13:55.878
going very
South Pole on me.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.271
Well, I wish

13:57.314 --> 13:58.533
that I could move
to the South Pole

13:58.576 --> 14:00.143
for Christmas.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.841
That bad?

14:01.884 --> 14:03.407
Yeah, me, too.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.889
Why you?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.151
Ladies first.

14:08.195 --> 14:11.894
Well, my ex-husband
is my business partner.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.549
Wow.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.942
That is a mouthful.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.334
And, uh...

14:17.378 --> 14:19.641
at every fiscal year,

14:19.684 --> 14:22.078
which for us
happens at Christmas time,

14:22.122 --> 14:23.427
he torments me,

14:23.471 --> 14:26.300
trying to get me to sell him
my travel agency,

14:26.343 --> 14:27.954
which I started.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.129
I'm really sorry.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.741
Your turn.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.917
Well, I think I might be
a Christmas jinx,

14:34.961 --> 14:37.485
which means I do
stupid things at Christmas,

14:37.528 --> 14:39.443
not all of which are my fault.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.968
Can you give me an example?

14:42.011 --> 14:45.188
I can give you 20,
including promising my boss

14:45.232 --> 14:48.104
that I would take my girlfriend,
which I don't have,

14:48.148 --> 14:50.106
to the office Christmas party
in a week.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.499
Why would you do that?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.196
I don't know.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.155
Christmas just stresses me out.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.071
Maybe there's, like,
a hotline we could call?

15:02.771 --> 15:06.166
What if we made an arrangement

15:06.209 --> 15:08.603
to socially navigate
Christmas together?

15:08.646 --> 15:11.562
Is this something stupid
that you're doing?

15:11.606 --> 15:13.564
Yeah, maybe,
but you seem nice and...

15:13.608 --> 15:14.609
normal.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.480
Thank you.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.308
You don't seem normal at all.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.657
But I'm very nice,
and you have to admit,

15:19.701 --> 15:22.269
a business deal
could be mutually beneficial.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.575
It's better than a club.
No politics.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.449
No secret handshakes?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.712
No... hideouts?

15:30.755 --> 15:33.280
A company arrangement,
a public offering even.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.542
We could attend events together.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.936
I could distract you
from your ex-husband.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.982
Allies against
the Christmas madness?

15:40.026 --> 15:42.202
Like Christmas associates?

15:42.245 --> 15:43.681
Yeah.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.596
A Yuletide-oriented duty.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.121
Like mistletoe.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.124
Yes, but no PDA, promise.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.997
Okay, um...

15:55.041 --> 15:58.218
this is the craziest thing
that I have ever heard.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.091
[Elise]: If you could ask Santa
for anything that you want,

16:02.135 --> 16:03.745
what would that be?

16:03.788 --> 16:06.356
Roll the calendar
forward to New Year's.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.967
[laughs]

16:08.010 --> 16:09.794
Look, I deserve
to be made partner,

16:09.838 --> 16:11.666
and I don't see
why my personal life

16:11.709 --> 16:14.843
should have any merit
on that decision.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.063
I'd ask Santa
to consider me as I am.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.936
What about you?

16:20.980 --> 16:24.635
I would ask
for my life back.

16:24.679 --> 16:27.464
My dignity.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.379
My business.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.468
Not my ex-husband.

16:32.948 --> 16:36.647
What if this arrangement
could get us all those things?

16:36.691 --> 16:37.953
Well, that would be

16:37.997 --> 16:39.737
a definitive
Christmas miracle.

16:41.696 --> 16:42.697
Feeling ambitious?

16:44.046 --> 16:45.526
And incredibly professional.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.310
Great.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.529
I'll draw up a contract,

16:48.572 --> 16:49.573
and we can talk about it
at lunch tomorrow.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.054
Yes, but first,

16:52.098 --> 16:55.101
we're going to have
to get a picture with Santa.

16:55.144 --> 16:57.190
-Oh, come on, seriously?
-Yes!

16:58.582 --> 17:00.280
Call it
a gentleman's handshake.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.028
-Hi.
-How are you?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.811
Wow! Wow.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.951
Secret Santa Bonanza.
Put your hand in the hat.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.693
I hope you're getting
some work done, Zoey.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.391
Always.
Don't peek.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.435
Oh.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.655
I drew Drew.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.309
Yikes!
Put it back in.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.571
I won't tell anyone.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.487
No, Zoey.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.444
Sometimes, you have
to play your hand,

17:34.488 --> 17:35.619
even when the deck is stacked.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.534
Maybe this will be
your last low point

17:37.578 --> 17:39.536
of the year.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.104
We have a three-alarm problem
at the Smithsonian right now.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.410
Four tour buses
just showed up

17:43.453 --> 17:44.454
with no scheduled tours
booked for them,

17:44.498 --> 17:45.455
and I booked them.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.066
It's bad.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.677
No more predictions
from you, Zoey.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.467
[Ashley]:
That's your plan?

17:57.511 --> 17:59.078
Yep.
What could go wrong?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.731
You don't know each other.
At all.

18:00.775 --> 18:01.732
You're going
to try and pass her off

18:01.776 --> 18:02.733
as your long-term girlfriend

18:02.777 --> 18:04.692
to bosses
in charge of your fate?

18:04.735 --> 18:06.085
Really, Nick?

18:06.128 --> 18:07.695
I need some guy friends.
They would totally get it.

18:07.738 --> 18:08.696
You definitely need
to be more socialized,

18:08.739 --> 18:09.914
that's for sure!

18:09.958 --> 18:11.612
Please don't call me
a workaholic.

18:11.655 --> 18:12.917
Not today.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.136
You need to get
to know this woman, Nicholas.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.137
Is that a bad thing?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.269
Depends.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.575
She most likely
has a heart, feelings...

18:20.142 --> 18:21.361
It's a contract.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.884
We agreed.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.495
Yeah...
'cause that's how girls work.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.115
So, you actually
drew up a contract?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.116
You really are a lawyer.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.117
Just business.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.118
It is.

18:41.032 --> 18:44.253
"Contract" is stiff, though.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.994
You're busting me
on the doc title?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.300
We're going to be here
through dinner.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.171
Well, I know my way
around a contract.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.172
Is that so?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.565
Yes!
How do you think

18:51.608 --> 18:53.654
that my ex-husband
is still my business partner?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.090
I learned the hard way.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.310
Okay.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.746
Mistletoe Brief?

18:58.789 --> 18:59.747
What about...

18:59.790 --> 19:01.618
"Promise?"

19:01.662 --> 19:02.706
Mistletoe Promise.

19:03.707 --> 19:04.665
I like it.

19:04.708 --> 19:05.709
Me, too.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.801
All right.
Lunch every day?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.238
Right,
when it makes sense.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.891
We're going to need
to be familiar with each other

19:13.935 --> 19:14.936
if we're going
to pull this thing off.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.720
Okay...

19:16.764 --> 19:18.418
and what kind
of evening activities

19:18.461 --> 19:20.115
are we talking about
once a week?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.205
I don't know.
I like action films.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.554
You know what?

19:24.598 --> 19:25.773
There's a screening
of "It's a Wonderful Life"

19:25.816 --> 19:26.687
this Wednesday...
have you ever seen it?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.297
Definitely not.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.907
Well, you need to trust me,
because it's actually fantastic.

19:29.951 --> 19:30.952
So we're going to that.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.781
All right, so...

19:33.824 --> 19:36.523
"Best effort to demonstrate
a caring relationship"

19:36.566 --> 19:37.567
means...?

19:37.611 --> 19:40.135
Well,
compassion, consideration,

19:40.179 --> 19:41.658
handholding
when it makes sense.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.573
Emotional hand-holding,
or physical?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.009
Depends on the situation.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.447
If you're going to be
my girlfriend in public,

19:47.490 --> 19:49.753
actual hand-holding
would be appropriate.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.451
Agreed,
but we need to make it clear

19:51.494 --> 19:53.844
that we're not
the PDA type of couple.

19:53.888 --> 19:54.889
Right, okay, yeah,

19:54.932 --> 19:57.152
I will, uh...
make a note of that.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.980
Add it in.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.721
Okay.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.549
Okay, wait, whoa...

20:02.592 --> 20:03.898
what, travel?

20:03.941 --> 20:05.769
Partners' meeting
is in New York.

20:05.813 --> 20:06.770
You will have your own room,

20:06.814 --> 20:09.164
First-class air travel.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.165
It's the last weekend

20:10.209 --> 20:11.601
heading into Christmas Eve.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.169
And the contract
expires on Christmas Eve?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.258
Yep. Figured we can handle
the big day on our own.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.433
Totally.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.915
Whoa, will you explain
these addendums to me?

20:22.090 --> 20:24.614
The relationship
should be shallow.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.137
Deeply superficial.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.226
Exactly.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.139
And the second?

20:28.183 --> 20:29.445
No drama.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.490
Life's too short.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.056
Done and done.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.710
Great.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.321
Well, I will make
these changes,

20:35.364 --> 20:36.887
and email them
over to you.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.942
Elise! Elise!

20:47.985 --> 20:50.205
You have to help me.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.686
Drew is a disaster
on the teleprompter.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
Dan, you didn't run

20:54.340 --> 20:56.037
any of this
promotional past me,

20:56.080 --> 20:57.038
so you handle it.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.562
[spluttering]
Listen to me! Elise!

20:59.606 --> 21:01.999
This could put us on the map.

21:02.043 --> 21:05.046
How is this
about us...

21:05.089 --> 21:06.874
when you and Drew just
keep playing for each other?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.184
Oh.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.577
Hah...
Good for Zoey.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.578
Zoe!

21:15.622 --> 21:17.101
Yes! Ooh!

21:18.929 --> 21:19.887
Huh?

21:19.930 --> 21:22.324
Not for me.
They're for Elise?

21:24.805 --> 21:26.763
Who's Nick?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.557
You little minx!

21:37.600 --> 21:38.601
Or is it fox?

21:38.645 --> 21:40.429
Uh...

21:40.473 --> 21:41.822
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.520
You have a secret beau
and failed to tell me,

21:44.564 --> 21:46.479
or you've invented a man
to drive Dan bonkers.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.917
Oh, well, I assure you
that I'm not that imaginative.

21:49.960 --> 21:50.918
[text chimes]

21:50.961 --> 21:52.485
I didn't
think so either.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.271
So who is he?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.447
He is a guy

21:58.491 --> 21:59.753
that I met at...

21:59.796 --> 22:01.102
um...

22:01.145 --> 22:02.321
the mall.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.715
Elise, no!
We don't date retail after 30!

22:05.759 --> 22:07.587
Holly!
Don't be a snob.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.328
Don't be a sucker.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.199
Retail people are predatorial
at Christmas.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.376
He's a lawyer.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
Oh, Holy Night!
Say "yes"!

22:18.424 --> 22:19.555
Say "yes" to what?

22:19.599 --> 22:20.600
To everything at this point.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.688
You have a boyfriend!

22:21.731 --> 22:22.993
I do not have a boyfriend!

22:23.037 --> 22:24.473
I have a...

22:24.517 --> 22:26.954
a romantic interest.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.304
For now.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.837
That movie was so good
on a big screen.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.144
Yeah, so smart
and dark.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.016
Makes you feel amazing.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.148
I feel amazing!

22:47.191 --> 22:48.715
[laughs]

22:48.758 --> 22:50.369
I never thought I could like
a Christmas movie.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.413
It was just...

22:53.981 --> 22:55.286
You can tell me.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.245
Just keep it shallow.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.770
Well, I've been accused,
not lately,

23:00.814 --> 23:02.598
of being a workaholic,

23:02.642 --> 23:05.384
but I like
helping people.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.472
I like being good
at my job,

23:06.515 --> 23:07.429
and I am,

23:07.473 --> 23:09.692
and I do help people.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.738
Well, I, too,
am accused

23:11.781 --> 23:13.000
of working too much,

23:13.043 --> 23:16.046
but I love my job,
and I'm good at my job.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.787
I don't know,
I think that...

23:17.831 --> 23:19.702
you know, when
a family or a couple

23:19.746 --> 23:21.008
comes back
from a vacation,

23:21.051 --> 23:23.140
they're so grateful,
and they're so content.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.186
I can't imagine that they
don't bring that back

23:25.229 --> 23:26.448
to other people
in their lives.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.842
Yeah, that's exactly it.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.713
I make it easier
for people

23:30.757 --> 23:32.019
to have a fresh start,

23:32.062 --> 23:33.542
people who need it.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.631
I help them see
that the light in the tunnel

23:35.675 --> 23:37.067
is not a train.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.373
I'm like George Bailey
in that film.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.374
[laughs]

23:39.418 --> 23:40.636
[clock tower bell rings]

23:40.680 --> 23:42.290
Ah!

23:42.333 --> 23:44.161
Another angel
just got his wings!

23:44.205 --> 23:45.511
[laughing]

23:47.991 --> 23:49.776
Mm...

23:49.819 --> 23:50.733
You know,
you never told me

23:50.777 --> 23:51.952
what kind of law
you practice.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.302
Nah, let's just
keep it shallow.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.956
Uh, well, I'm going
to find out

23:55.999 --> 23:58.262
at the tree-trimming party.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.047
Well, I'm a divorce attorney.

24:01.788 --> 24:02.919
You're kidding.

24:02.963 --> 24:03.964
No, I...

24:04.007 --> 24:05.008
I think it's important

24:05.052 --> 24:07.141
how people move
through tough times.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.186
That's where
a good family lawyer comes in.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.147
Yeah.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.105
I never really got
a chance to move on,

24:15.149 --> 24:16.367
but...

24:17.717 --> 24:19.719
now we're swimming
into the deep end, so...

24:19.762 --> 24:22.025
It's okay.
You can tell me about it.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.549
No.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.072
This is
a business agreement.

24:25.115 --> 24:28.031
Maybe the contract
was ill-conceived?

24:29.555 --> 24:31.905
Well, it is
dried in ink now.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.474
Right.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.824
And you wrote it.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.391
True.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.919
Okay, what's happening?

24:46.920 --> 24:47.877
This was my life,

24:47.921 --> 24:50.880
and now, it's... yours.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.665
Yeah, the, uh...

24:52.708 --> 24:54.667
the balloons are a little...
they're weird.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.277
Um, I'll tell him.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.844
Oh, no, I'll tell him...

24:57.887 --> 24:59.454
if he ever calls.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.891
So I can decide
if he's... real.

25:01.935 --> 25:02.936
If he's...

25:03.893 --> 25:05.068
Really?

25:05.112 --> 25:07.506
Well, you hear stories
of lonely ladies.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.246
Not saying they're you.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.555
Oh...

25:15.165 --> 25:16.123
This just came for you.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.255
Oh, thank you.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.692
Oh, come on!

25:19.735 --> 25:21.432
Presents now?

25:21.476 --> 25:22.695
Presents?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.655
Love you, too, Zoey.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.222
[Holly]: You're
the talk of the office.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.615
Yeah, when am I not?

25:29.658 --> 25:31.834
But now you're the envied
talk of the office...

25:31.878 --> 25:33.183
unless he's ugly.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.315
Not that ugly is a setback.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.403
Okay, let's just not be
those people.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.318
Yeah, let's definitely not.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.798
Right?

25:40.103 --> 25:41.583
He's not ugly.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.677
[chimes ring]

25:50.549 --> 25:52.507
An angel gets its wings.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.555
It's an inside joke.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.731
Inside jokes, too?

26:00.428 --> 26:01.560
Good for you.

26:01.603 --> 26:02.691
[chimes ring]

26:05.041 --> 26:06.303
Okay...

26:10.264 --> 26:12.440
Well, that went well.

26:12.483 --> 26:13.615
More than answers things.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.051
Okay.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.183
[phone vibrates]

26:18.402 --> 26:19.578
Hi!

26:19.621 --> 26:20.883
You get the balloons?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.059
Yes, and the chimes.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.800
Uh, thank you.

26:24.844 --> 26:28.151
The office
is gossiping overtime.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.631
The balloons are a bit...

26:29.675 --> 26:30.632
Kiddie party?

26:30.676 --> 26:31.938
Yeah.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.983
Well, it was either that
or a cake pop tree.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.637
I could feed the whole office
with a cake pop tree.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.638
They'd love it.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.118
Duly noted.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.728
I'm all thumbs
with these things.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.121
You're doing fine.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.297
Did you know
that red roses are pricier

26:43.340 --> 26:44.690
for no particular reason?

26:44.733 --> 26:45.691
They're just price-gouging
romantics.

26:45.734 --> 26:46.779
I mean, come on...

26:46.822 --> 26:47.823
Okay, yeah, um...

26:47.867 --> 26:49.216
now you're all thumbs.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.392
Right.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.003
So what's up?
Just saying hi?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.396
I was just wondering,

26:55.439 --> 26:58.312
do you think
that maybe you could, uh...

26:58.355 --> 27:01.184
pick me up for lunch
at the office today?

27:01.228 --> 27:03.012
Sure! Love to.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.318
In fact, I need help picking up
an ornament

27:04.361 --> 27:06.581
for the tree-trimming party.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.670
Do you think that maybe
you could come a bit early,

27:08.714 --> 27:09.671
also?

27:09.715 --> 27:11.325
Will do.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.298
Hi...

27:28.342 --> 27:30.910
Welcome
to World Bright Travel!!

27:30.953 --> 27:32.433
You must be Zoey.

27:32.476 --> 27:33.521
Yes!

27:33.564 --> 27:34.696
Who wants to know?

27:34.740 --> 27:35.871
I'm Nick.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.046
I'm here for Elise.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.918
No! Seriously?

27:38.961 --> 27:41.703
Yes, I'm pretty
sure about that.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.444
Right this way. Elise!

27:46.752 --> 27:48.884
Hi!
How are you, hon?

27:48.928 --> 27:50.364
Ready to go?

27:50.407 --> 27:51.800
Starving.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.062
Thank you.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.902
Okay, don't
turn around.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.904
Are they all
mobbing the windows?

28:12.299 --> 28:14.040
Well, I love it when
business works out.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.835
I have never been
in a Christmas store.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.664
Ever?

28:33.189 --> 28:35.714
Are we nearing
a panic attack?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.411
No. That would fall
under "drama."

28:39.021 --> 28:40.153
Okay.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.938
Well, let's just
break it up into sections.

28:42.982 --> 28:43.852
Right?

28:43.896 --> 28:44.897
Right.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.028
Oh!

28:46.072 --> 28:49.423
Uh, what about
a sparkly nutcracker?

28:49.466 --> 28:50.511
It would say

28:50.554 --> 28:52.165
that I'm disciplined,
hardworking,

28:52.208 --> 28:53.296
sparkly,

28:53.340 --> 28:54.820
so I know
how to have fun, right?

28:54.863 --> 28:56.517
I just think you're
over-thinking it,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.301
so just tell me
a little bit more

28:58.345 --> 28:59.781
about your boss.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.478
Okay, well...

29:01.522 --> 29:04.394
Christmas is very important
at the firm.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.179
Strictly family law,

29:06.222 --> 29:07.920
and what I like about the firm

29:07.963 --> 29:10.009
is they're not interested
in making money

29:10.052 --> 29:11.097
off of other people's suffering.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.447
They're interested in...

29:13.490 --> 29:16.885
in helping people
solve their problems legally.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.454
Okay.

29:20.497 --> 29:24.414
So we need something
that says...

29:24.458 --> 29:25.807
Peace on Earth,

29:25.851 --> 29:27.243
or even better

29:27.287 --> 29:29.071
is something
that symbolizes that, right?

29:29.115 --> 29:30.420
Exactly! Yes.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.037
I mean...

29:40.474 --> 29:42.084
right in front of our eyes.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.177
Perfect.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.571
It's beautiful.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.528
Gentle. Gentle.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.840
So Christmas really
doesn't bother you?

30:00.059 --> 30:02.844
Uh, it used to be
my favorite time of year.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.150
Why?

30:04.193 --> 30:05.151
Uh...

30:05.194 --> 30:06.543
I don't know.

30:06.587 --> 30:10.243
Maybe because
it's cold and gloomy out,

30:10.286 --> 30:13.855
and everybody needs a sense
of good warmth and cheer.

30:13.899 --> 30:17.554
It just sounds
like good problem-solving to me.

30:17.598 --> 30:20.035
Well, that's very
business-sensible.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.168
Guilty as charged.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.997
Well, I'm in family law,
so no guilt involved.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.260
Hah! Well...

30:29.828 --> 30:33.222
I started a charity component
to my company

30:33.266 --> 30:36.269
a year before my ex-husband
joined the company,

30:36.312 --> 30:39.750
and... it's incredible.

30:39.794 --> 30:44.277
We provide field trips
for underprivileged kids

30:44.320 --> 30:47.106
to historical
and national landmarks,

30:47.149 --> 30:49.282
and you should see...

30:49.325 --> 30:50.849
oh, my gosh, the letters
that come pouring in,

30:50.892 --> 30:51.893
it's amazing...

30:51.937 --> 30:55.679
and Dan...
[laughs awkwardly]

30:55.723 --> 30:57.290
wants to kill the program

30:57.333 --> 30:59.466
because he said
it's financially draining.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.381
Why does he care?

31:03.426 --> 31:05.037
Uh, did I mention

31:05.080 --> 31:07.256
that Dan has a thing
for sports cars

31:07.300 --> 31:10.781
and a chronic flirtation
with debt?

31:10.825 --> 31:13.175
So what does he contribute
to the business?

31:16.004 --> 31:19.486
He does his part...
recklessly.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.357
He's in charge
of marketing...

31:21.401 --> 31:23.925
a company that
I started myself.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.666
You know,

31:25.709 --> 31:28.930
but the truth is, is that
we can afford to give,

31:28.974 --> 31:30.497
and I just don't think

31:30.540 --> 31:34.066
that the spirit of giving
shouldn't be year-round.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.896
You don't have a Scrooge bone
in your body, do you?

31:39.985 --> 31:41.769
No, I am 100% Tiny Tim.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.208
I can't give up
on these kids.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.731
I, I...

31:47.775 --> 31:48.863
I have to give back.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.865
I get it.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.040
What he doesn't get

31:52.084 --> 31:53.172
is that he needs me
professionally.

31:53.215 --> 31:54.434
I don't need him.

31:54.477 --> 31:55.783
I don't need
his girlfriend.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.263
And I believe

31:57.306 --> 32:01.702
that they're leading us
down a less-elegant path...

32:01.745 --> 32:06.228
and he refuses to sell me
his half of the company,

32:06.272 --> 32:07.751
and I just...

32:11.973 --> 32:14.236
I just...
practically gave it to him

32:14.280 --> 32:15.542
because I was in love once.

32:15.585 --> 32:16.847
I just...

32:17.936 --> 32:18.937
Elise...

32:22.157 --> 32:23.898
You know what?

32:23.942 --> 32:28.076
That is deep enough
for today...

32:28.120 --> 32:30.339
because we debut
as a power couple

32:30.383 --> 32:31.340
this weekend,

32:31.384 --> 32:32.646
so...

32:32.689 --> 32:34.735
we need to focus up.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.606
Right.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.173
Focus up.

32:43.787 --> 32:48.792
[♪♪♪]

32:52.492 --> 32:53.667
-Hey!
-Hey.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.538
What's that?

32:55.582 --> 32:57.279
Nothing.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.280
Nervous?

32:58.324 --> 32:59.890
I am now.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.371
So I did some snooping,
very stealth-like.

33:02.415 --> 33:05.070
You're good
in a sports coat, no tie.

33:05.113 --> 33:06.375
All the ladies
are wearing dresses.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.898
Pants for women?
Frowned upon.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.335
Seriously?

33:09.378 --> 33:10.858
Hey, I'm trying to help.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.338
[sighs]

33:12.381 --> 33:13.382
Later.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.080
Yeah, later.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.304
I don't understand how
this is happening, guys!

33:22.348 --> 33:23.871
I've checked the orders
against the schedules

33:23.914 --> 33:25.351
against the tours
at the Metropolitan.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.222
I don't know
how any of this is happening!

33:27.266 --> 33:28.702
[phone vibrates]

33:28.745 --> 33:30.051
[gasps]
Ooh, "Saint Nick" is calling.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.533
Saint Nick?
That is so cute!

33:33.576 --> 33:35.317
Hey, Zoey,
give, please.

33:35.361 --> 33:36.318
Hello?

33:36.362 --> 33:37.537
Hi!

33:37.580 --> 33:39.278
Hi, listen, this...

33:39.321 --> 33:41.541
I have a very big roaring fire

33:41.584 --> 33:42.585
that I'm trying to put out
right now.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.283
We good for lunch?

33:44.326 --> 33:45.762
I'm sorry.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.590
Three school tour buses
just, like, imploded on us,

33:47.634 --> 33:48.765
and I have to figure
this thing out.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.158
Oh...

33:50.202 --> 33:52.421
but we're still on
for tonight, right?

33:52.465 --> 33:56.295
Because it's been suggested
that you wear... a dress.

33:56.338 --> 33:57.513
I hope that's all right.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.255
Yes, I am a woman.
I definitely have some.

34:00.299 --> 34:01.300
I've got to go.

34:04.868 --> 34:05.826
Okay.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.437
You just hung up
on him.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.786
You never just
hang up on them.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.440
Guys, he's fine.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.094
We have a major problem
we have to solve here.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.270
We date.

34:15.313 --> 34:16.271
We know.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.577
You never want to remind them

34:17.620 --> 34:18.969
that you could be
the first to hang up.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.449
Okay, you know what?
That is the silliest thing.

34:20.493 --> 34:21.755
-Never.
-Ever.

34:22.755 --> 34:23.931
Back to work.
Come on!

34:23.974 --> 34:27.413
She just...
hung up on me.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.415
What if she bails
on me tonight?

34:29.458 --> 34:30.416
I think
she's putting out fires,

34:30.458 --> 34:31.634
like she said.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.723
Yeah, well, what if
it burns all night?

34:33.766 --> 34:36.770
I'm sure
she's pretty competent.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.598
I don't know,
it's just...

34:38.641 --> 34:40.774
I have a lot
invested in this.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.080
Careful.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.647
You are starting to sound
like a love interest.

34:44.690 --> 34:46.214
It's a business contract,

34:46.257 --> 34:48.911
and I need a...
specific result.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.436
I didn't realize
until this moment,

34:50.478 --> 34:53.525
but maybe that's
how women look at love.

34:53.569 --> 34:54.614
Like business?

34:54.657 --> 34:55.658
Yeah, maybe.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.271
You know,
I really like

34:59.314 --> 35:03.753
this crestfallen cupid
vulnerability on you.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.104
Maybe you should
wear the skirt?

35:06.147 --> 35:07.105
Ha, ha, ha.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.198
[Bradford]: So the apartment

35:13.241 --> 35:14.547
doesn't have
a stick of furniture.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.114
We're there with the pieces
all over the floor

35:16.157 --> 35:17.680
and the instructions
are in Swedish!

35:17.724 --> 35:18.942
[laughing]

35:18.986 --> 35:20.335
Took us all night,
didn't it, honey?

35:20.379 --> 35:21.162
Yeah.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.685
[chuckling] Yeah.

35:22.729 --> 35:25.123
We built that
bedside table.

35:28.735 --> 35:29.692
[Nick]: Hi.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.693
Nick!

35:30.737 --> 35:32.913
Hi.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.047
Well, I knew
you would show up one day

35:37.091 --> 35:38.875
with a date as striking as you.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.964
Oh, ha ha!
Thank you.

35:41.008 --> 35:41.878
Sharon Hitesman.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.271
Elise Donner.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.925
We rehearse our entrances,
but don't tell anybody.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.318
[laughing]

35:46.361 --> 35:47.710
Sol Hitesman, Elise.
Welcome to our home.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.625
Oh, thank you
for having us.

35:49.669 --> 35:50.844
I'm thinking drinks,
introductions,

35:50.887 --> 35:51.845
and then a quick tour.

35:51.888 --> 35:52.889
[Nick]: In that
order, please!

35:52.933 --> 35:54.152
Fantastic!

35:54.195 --> 35:55.544
-Come on in.
-Everyone, look who's arrived!

35:55.588 --> 35:57.198
Hi!

35:59.287 --> 36:00.854
Nice to see you, Nicholas.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.644
Do you need any help?

36:08.688 --> 36:10.211
Hello there!

36:10.255 --> 36:12.126
Um... how about
the candies?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.301
Sure.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.913
You have
a gorgeous home.

36:16.957 --> 36:19.002
Oh, we have
a giant mancave,

36:19.046 --> 36:20.917
and I've done
what I can.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.224
Well, clearly,
you've done a lot.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
Oh, well...

36:24.791 --> 36:26.836
you know, Nick has
done very well, too.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.229
Where exactly has he
been hiding you?

36:29.839 --> 36:31.754
Well, that's on me.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.495
I'm very private,

36:33.539 --> 36:35.932
and I work a lot,

36:35.976 --> 36:39.893
and Nick is incredibly patient.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.286
He's a perfect guy.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.113
Hi!

36:43.157 --> 36:45.115
I'm just trying to find
the powder room.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.378
Well, actually, she is,

36:46.421 --> 36:47.422
though I'm beginning
to doubt the ultrasound.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.858
I swear, she's kicking
my bladder

36:48.902 --> 36:51.252
harder than my son ever did.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.254
Well, girls can be
tomboys in the tummy.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.124
Follow me.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.387
Thank you.

37:03.133 --> 37:07.225
[♪♪♪]

37:14.667 --> 37:17.191
I love it when Sol keeps
track of me at parties.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.279
It's very sweet.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.762
So, any thoughts
on marriage and kids?

37:24.111 --> 37:26.156
I know
I'm being nosy.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.419
Well...

37:27.462 --> 37:30.944
yes, definitely,
when the time is right.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.772
I love children.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.122
I actually have
a charity component

37:35.165 --> 37:36.428
to my travel
business, and...

37:36.471 --> 37:37.864
Whoa, you know what?

37:37.907 --> 37:39.779
Save that story
for dinner.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.955
It will go over
very well.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.089
A girl can have
her favorites, can't she?

37:52.574 --> 37:53.358
It's beautiful.

37:53.401 --> 37:54.924
Thank you.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.409
What a wonderful job,
everyone.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.020
Are you just talking
about the tree?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.718
[laughing]

38:05.761 --> 38:07.415
[Sol]: All right,
now...

38:07.459 --> 38:08.373
I won't lie.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.201
We have had
a stellar year here,

38:11.245 --> 38:13.073
and everyone
in this room

38:13.116 --> 38:14.770
has played
a huge part...

38:14.814 --> 38:16.859
including
our loved ones.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.732
Now, I believe
that it's important

38:19.775 --> 38:21.124
to have someone
to come home to

38:21.168 --> 38:23.213
at the end of the day,

38:23.257 --> 38:27.174
to remind us
what really matters...

38:27.217 --> 38:28.523
spouses...

38:28.567 --> 38:29.742
children...

38:31.309 --> 38:33.441
family...

38:33.485 --> 38:35.095
and I believe

38:35.138 --> 38:37.097
that it gives us
some basis and some context

38:37.140 --> 38:38.707
for the work that we do.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.318
We understand

38:40.361 --> 38:42.798
that family
is the cornerstone of community,

38:42.842 --> 38:44.365
and by encouraging that ideal,

38:44.409 --> 38:49.196
it shows up in our work
and in our lives...

38:49.239 --> 38:50.632
because remember,

38:50.676 --> 38:55.158
there is nothing ever wrong
with being good people.

38:55.202 --> 38:58.118
Frankly, there's everything
right with being that.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.206
Exactly, Nick.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.036
So then...

39:03.079 --> 39:04.124
to good people.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.952
To good people.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.477
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.966
We're lying
to good people.

39:20.009 --> 39:22.011
Well, not lying,
just...

39:22.055 --> 39:23.926
stretching
their truth.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.451
Why?

39:28.017 --> 39:30.759
Because I had
three truly terrible Christmases

39:30.803 --> 39:32.152
that defined my life, Elise,

39:32.195 --> 39:33.893
and...

39:33.936 --> 39:35.373
I'm not a bad guy.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.466
Three ghosts.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.381
Like Scrooge.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.558
Well, Scrooge
is a business story.

39:46.601 --> 39:49.082
Yes, it is.

39:49.125 --> 39:50.475
My last
truly terrible Christmas

39:50.518 --> 39:53.913
was at the last law firm
I was working for.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.784
I was also
about to make partner,

39:55.828 --> 39:58.961
when I discovered
that one of the senior partners

39:59.005 --> 40:03.139
was overlooking
major conflicts of interest,

40:03.183 --> 40:05.446
which is criminal, by the way.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.275
And?

40:08.318 --> 40:11.321
And when
I raised concerns...

40:11.365 --> 40:13.846
I was fired

40:13.889 --> 40:16.762
and blackballed
from every firm in town.

40:16.805 --> 40:18.024
Not "good people."

40:19.417 --> 40:21.244
I'm so sorry.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.858
Sol Hitesman is the only person
that took a chance on me.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.383
And now
we're lying to him.

51:48.627 --> 51:50.194
I love my mom.

51:51.325 --> 51:53.153
I'm so sorry, Nick.

51:53.197 --> 51:55.242
She remarried...

51:55.286 --> 51:56.983
a nice doctor who believed

51:57.026 --> 52:00.639
that young men should be
educated at boarding schools.

52:00.682 --> 52:03.381
So I saw my mom
mostly at Christmas,

52:03.424 --> 52:04.730
and the better
my grades were,

52:04.773 --> 52:06.035
the happier they
were to see me...

52:07.167 --> 52:09.822
so I like working hard.

52:12.999 --> 52:15.175
I'm not good with
probing questions...

52:17.090 --> 52:18.918
and this is
a business contract, right?

52:20.180 --> 52:21.181
Right, yes, um...

52:21.225 --> 52:22.574
definitely.

52:22.617 --> 52:25.620
Hey, did you get the scarf
and mitts I sent over

52:25.664 --> 52:26.926
for the skating party
later tonight?

52:26.969 --> 52:28.188
Yes.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.189
Nick,
you're incredibly generous.

52:29.233 --> 52:30.669
-Great.
-[knocking]

52:30.712 --> 52:32.671
So sorry
to interrupt.

52:32.714 --> 52:33.889
Oh, no, not at all.

52:33.933 --> 52:35.239
The Peterson judgment
just came in.

52:35.282 --> 52:36.849
Oh! Oh.
Great. Great!

52:37.850 --> 52:39.504
Ah, that's going
to crash our lunch.

52:39.547 --> 52:40.548
I'm so sorry.

52:41.506 --> 52:44.335
No, no, it's okay.

52:44.378 --> 52:46.206
I will see you tonight.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.686
I'll show you out.

52:47.729 --> 52:48.861
It's okay.
I know the way.

52:50.123 --> 52:51.211
Bye.

52:53.909 --> 52:56.477
I just screwed that all up.
I am not good about my past.

52:56.521 --> 52:57.696
Don't I know it!

52:57.739 --> 52:59.437
What do I do?

52:59.480 --> 53:01.743
I think she's just enjoying
not feeling alone

53:01.787 --> 53:03.571
at Christmastime.

53:03.615 --> 53:04.572
I think you might be, too.

53:04.616 --> 53:06.270
I'm not alone.

53:06.313 --> 53:07.271
I have you...

53:07.314 --> 53:08.663
and a ton of work.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.927
Well, you were
whistling this morning.

53:11.971 --> 53:13.320
I whistle.

53:13.364 --> 53:14.539
Christmas songs?

53:15.540 --> 53:17.150
Christmas stresses me out.

53:18.325 --> 53:19.457
The Peterson judgement.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.501
Right.

53:24.723 --> 53:28.030
[♪♪♪]

53:28.074 --> 53:29.249
You're quiet tonight.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.294
Am I?

53:36.387 --> 53:38.127
Wow, you can skate.

53:38.171 --> 53:39.651
I can hang.

53:39.694 --> 53:40.782
Hey, come on,
lovebirds.

53:40.826 --> 53:41.914
Pick it up.

53:41.957 --> 53:43.611
On our way!

53:43.655 --> 53:44.873
All right.

53:46.788 --> 53:48.268
Clock is punched,
mister.

53:48.312 --> 53:49.965
-Let's go.
-Okay.

53:50.009 --> 53:51.750
-Right. Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

53:53.491 --> 53:55.536
-Bradford lettered in hockey.
-And you?

53:55.580 --> 53:57.799
Ice dancing,
semi-pro.

53:57.843 --> 53:58.887
Ah.

54:00.585 --> 54:03.588
How can you not take
all this as Christmas jinx-y?

54:03.631 --> 54:05.590
Because I am getting
very chummy with her,

54:05.633 --> 54:07.418
and she likes to talk...

54:07.461 --> 54:09.637
and I used to coach
figure skating.

54:09.681 --> 54:12.205
You really are amazing.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.206
Okay.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.599
-Okay. Ready?
-Uh-huh.

54:14.642 --> 54:15.991
Now pick up your feet more.

54:16.035 --> 54:17.036
Mm-hmm...

54:17.079 --> 54:19.517
Now push out,
push out with me.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.133
You two
look absolutely beautiful.

54:27.176 --> 54:28.265
Thank you!

54:28.308 --> 54:29.614
We've been waiting
all week for this.

54:31.355 --> 54:32.312
Whoa...

54:32.356 --> 54:33.313
Whoa... hey.

54:33.357 --> 54:35.141
We need to focus.

54:35.184 --> 54:37.448
We need to stay focused
on the goal, okay?

54:37.491 --> 54:38.536
You will succeed.

54:38.579 --> 54:40.625
At skating?

54:40.668 --> 54:42.844
At all of this, Nick.

54:42.888 --> 54:44.716
Thank you, Elise.

54:55.117 --> 54:57.337
Whee!

54:57.381 --> 54:58.643
Whoa...

54:58.686 --> 54:59.687
Whoo!

55:03.778 --> 55:04.736
Hey!

55:04.779 --> 55:05.780
[Elise giggles]

55:08.392 --> 55:10.437
You two have
such charm together.

55:10.481 --> 55:11.699
Ah, it's all her doing.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.266
I blame him.

55:16.922 --> 55:19.054
[Nick]: Well,
got to hand it to Bradford...

55:19.098 --> 55:20.839
It pays to have
multiple skill sets.

55:20.882 --> 55:22.231
And yet...

55:22.275 --> 55:23.581
Yes?

55:23.624 --> 55:25.887
Oh, well...

55:25.931 --> 55:28.194
My business
partner, Dan,

55:28.237 --> 55:30.588
hired a sales rep
one year,

55:30.631 --> 55:32.372
and he went fishing
through interviews

55:32.416 --> 55:34.331
to find incomparable
softball skills.

55:34.374 --> 55:35.767
How did that work out?

55:35.810 --> 55:37.899
Well, Dan received

55:37.943 --> 55:40.946
all of the coveted softball
trophies that he wanted,

55:40.989 --> 55:43.514
and our sales quotas
virtually plummeted

55:43.557 --> 55:44.602
for the entire year.

55:44.645 --> 55:45.777
Oh, ho!

55:45.820 --> 55:46.952
[Nick]:
That guy.

55:46.995 --> 55:49.476
Personally,
I know it's all fun,

55:49.520 --> 55:52.087
but I prefer,
in business,

55:52.131 --> 55:53.959
business minds
at the helm.

55:54.002 --> 55:56.091
I like a guy
that works overtime.

56:04.491 --> 56:05.884
You two are
amazing out there.

56:05.927 --> 56:07.842
Like, born
for each other.

56:07.886 --> 56:09.540
Not bad, right?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.933
Considering
I'm his third wife.

56:11.977 --> 56:14.283
Don't quote me on that.

56:14.327 --> 56:15.807
You are so much fun,
by the way.

56:15.850 --> 56:17.374
Thank you!

56:26.731 --> 56:29.603
You went
above and beyond today.

56:29.647 --> 56:30.909
Thank you.

56:30.952 --> 56:32.563
I want to be
as valuable to you

56:32.606 --> 56:34.782
as you've been to me.

56:38.003 --> 56:40.527
We don't have
the same goals, Nick.

56:42.573 --> 56:47.360
I'm stuck with Dan
and his childish work tortures,

56:47.404 --> 56:49.144
and...

56:50.319 --> 56:53.018
I own my mistakes
that led me to that...

56:55.803 --> 56:57.718
and I kind of feel like I'm...

56:59.372 --> 57:01.809
starting to wake up
to life again.

57:03.942 --> 57:06.988
It's a good thing...

57:07.032 --> 57:09.034
but I don't expect Santa,

57:09.077 --> 57:12.211
or miracles,

57:12.254 --> 57:14.735
or angels getting their wings.

57:14.779 --> 57:18.478
What would winning
look like for you?

57:19.958 --> 57:23.178
I don't know anymore, Nick...

57:25.572 --> 57:27.487
but I'm glad I have
a Christmas tree.

57:29.141 --> 57:31.099
So thank you for that.

57:36.496 --> 57:38.672
Good night.

57:38.716 --> 57:40.544
Good night.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.512
-Hi.
-Oh, hi!

57:52.556 --> 57:53.513
You're looking
very sharp.

57:53.557 --> 57:54.732
Oh, thank you.

57:54.775 --> 57:56.516
Dan!
Just the man I wanted to see.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.171
Uh, you know, Drew and I,
we're just heading out.

57:59.214 --> 58:00.215
This'll just
take a second.

58:00.259 --> 58:01.390
Turns out we both
have friends

58:01.434 --> 58:02.870
on the police force,

58:02.914 --> 58:03.958
and my buddy tells me

58:04.002 --> 58:07.440
that you had your
buddy run my plates.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.181
Anything specifically
you were looking for?

58:11.400 --> 58:13.228
No...
I just...

58:13.272 --> 58:14.621
Come on, honey,
let's, um...

58:14.665 --> 58:18.625
See, the thing is,
my buddy is your buddy's boss,

58:18.669 --> 58:21.367
so... that didn't
work out so well,

58:21.410 --> 58:22.803
but I'm just
happy to know

58:22.847 --> 58:25.545
that your natural affection
and protection for Elise

58:25.589 --> 58:26.677
still exists.

58:27.895 --> 58:28.853
That's right.

58:28.896 --> 58:30.550
We care a lot for Elise,

58:30.594 --> 58:32.726
and we're all under a lot of
stress this season at work.

58:32.770 --> 58:34.423
Right, the Reindeer Report.

58:34.467 --> 58:35.816
Exciting!

58:35.860 --> 58:37.644
Elise tells me you have
a lot of memorizing to do?

58:37.688 --> 58:39.211
Yeah, I'm just
more comfortable

58:39.254 --> 58:40.473
when I know a subject

58:40.517 --> 58:42.040
than when
I'm reading it out loud.

58:44.129 --> 58:45.434
[Nick]: You know...

58:45.478 --> 58:49.134
I have a lot of tricks
from memorizing case facts.

58:49.177 --> 58:50.701
I'd be happy
to teach you.

58:50.744 --> 58:51.745
Nick?

58:51.789 --> 58:53.573
Hey, hon.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.531
Yes! Definitely.

58:54.574 --> 58:56.402
[Dan]: Uh, Drew, you know,

58:56.445 --> 58:57.621
we really should
be going.

58:57.664 --> 58:58.839
How about
after lunch?

58:58.883 --> 59:00.449
I have the whole afternoon off,
actually.

59:00.493 --> 59:02.190
Uh, Nick? Nick!

59:02.234 --> 59:03.931
Just a second, honey.

59:03.975 --> 59:05.237
So, after lunch,
we'll get to work?

59:05.280 --> 59:06.325
You know,
I don't think...

59:06.368 --> 59:07.544
It's perfect.
Yes, please.

59:07.587 --> 59:08.545
Great!

59:09.850 --> 59:11.069
Great.

59:13.550 --> 59:14.551
Hi!

59:16.814 --> 59:17.989
Look.

59:18.032 --> 59:19.773
Wonton soup.

59:19.817 --> 59:20.948
Who are you,

59:20.992 --> 59:21.775
and what have you
done with Nicholas?

59:21.819 --> 59:23.472
I am starting to learn

59:23.516 --> 59:26.519
that you have a plan for me
to get my partnership...

59:26.563 --> 59:27.433
yes?

59:27.476 --> 59:29.217
Maybe.

59:29.261 --> 59:30.218
Yes.

59:30.262 --> 59:33.352
Well, I'm hatching
a plan, too,

59:33.395 --> 59:34.919
and we need
to be at the TV station

59:34.962 --> 59:36.703
for Drew's Reindeer Report.

59:36.747 --> 59:38.792
Uh, absolutely not.

59:38.836 --> 59:39.793
Ah, yes.

59:39.837 --> 59:41.229
Also, I need to leave here

59:41.273 --> 59:42.622
with a copy
of your business contract.

59:42.666 --> 59:43.623
You already have a copy.

59:43.667 --> 59:44.668
No, um...

59:46.017 --> 59:47.671
not the...

59:47.714 --> 59:49.150
"Mistletoe Promise."

59:49.194 --> 59:50.630
Your and Dan's actual contract.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.545
Nick...

59:54.112 --> 59:56.549
please don't get my hopes up.

59:57.550 --> 59:58.507
That's my line.

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:01.946
Wonton soup.

01:00:04.209 --> 01:00:05.297
Mm...

01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:10.476
-[Drew]: Report...
-[Nick]: Report.

01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:11.651
-[Drew]: Report...
-[Nick]: Not re-port...

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:14.480
[Nick]: There is it. Great!

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:16.569
[Drew rehearsing,
Nick coaching]

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.092
They've been in there
a long time.

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:20.442
Yeah, well, I am guessing
it's a pretty long job.

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:22.183
Really loose.

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.055
Really loose.

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:26.361
[Holly]:
I'm proud of you, El.

01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:27.841
You hung in there like a pro,

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:29.974
and you caught
a really great guy.

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:32.672
Well, we've only been dating
for a little bit, so...

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:34.195
Don't do that.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:36.241
Live in possibility now.

01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:38.069
[Drew]:
Thank you so much.

01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:39.679
Yep.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:40.898
All right.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:41.942
It's going
to be so good!

01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:43.727
Yes, it is.
So good.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:48.688
Hey.

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:55.477
So, what do you think?

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.565
I think...

01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:57.654
dress sharp
for the Reindeer Report.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.309
Yeah,
we will not be going to that.

01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:04.051
It's your company,
and I promised Drew, so...

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:05.096
yes, we are.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.277
You look great,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.670
as always.

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:14.540
Thank you.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:15.628
I can't believe

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:16.760
that we're actually
going to this.

01:01:16.803 --> 01:01:18.065
Trust me.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:33.820
All right, well...

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:34.995
there's your stage.

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:36.301
Okay...

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:38.259
All right,
there's your mark.

01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:40.087
Put your little toes
right there.

01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:43.351
Uh, why don't we watch
from the green room?

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:44.526
I don't want
to make her nervous.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.311
You stay put,
young lady.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:53.318
Good evening, Santa watchers.

01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:54.406
As promised tonight,

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:56.538
our state's very own
Drew Richards

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:58.540
will walk us through
Santa's planned sleigh routes

01:01:58.584 --> 01:01:59.759
this Christmas.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:01.456
Our famed Reindeer Report
brought to you

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.416
by the folks
at World Bright Travel Agency.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:07.027
"Every day is a present
when on a vacation."

01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:08.159
Take it away, Drew.

01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:15.253
I'm Drew!

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:18.865
Hi...

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:19.997
everybody.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.786
[whispering]
Reindeer Report.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.136
This is
the Reindeer Report.

01:02:30.355 --> 01:02:32.400
This is the Reindeer Report.

01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:34.968
Okay.

01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:38.842
-What?
-You got this.

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:40.321
What?

01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:41.583
You got this.
Let's go.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.584
Say something!

01:02:45.413 --> 01:02:47.459
Hi, everyone!
My apologies.

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:49.896
I'm Elise Donner
from World Bright Travel Agency.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.245
I'm so sorry, Drew,

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.247
but we have a breaking
news report from Santa!

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.597
Santa has decided
to enter America

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.817
through New York City
this year,

01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.297
so he can go
catch a glimpse

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.125
of the beautiful Christmas tree
at Rockefeller Center.

01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:02.953
Soon, he will be
zigzagging his way

01:03:02.996 --> 01:03:05.042
through
the upper Midwest,

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.521
then, soon under his sleigh

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:07.653
will be the beautiful
Grand Canyon

01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:09.829
as he slides on in
to Los Angeles.

01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.832
These are all landmarks

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.834
of World Bright Travel's own

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:17.097
History Children's
Outreach Program,

01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.316
and they are
apparently favorites

01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:20.100
of Mr. and Mrs. Claus', too.

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:22.320
All right,
thanks very much, ladies.

01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:25.366
We'll take a break.
More coming up right after this.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.020
[applause]

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:28.761
[laughs]

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.154
Good thing Elise has

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.983
a public speaking
background, right?

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.867
Honestly, it's bizarre
he didn't show.

01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:50.087
No, he's just at a meeting.

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.045
What? Who is, Dan?

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:53.873
What? Dan?

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:54.918
Oh, God, no.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:57.398
Yes, Dan and Drew.

01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:59.270
Just ridiculous
to skip the Christmas lunch

01:03:59.313 --> 01:04:00.880
because you had to rescue
his girlfriend together.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.490
[mumbling] I know.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:04.144
It really did work out
for all of you.

01:04:04.188 --> 01:04:05.537
Um, Holly,

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.191
there is no such thing
as "working out" with Dan,

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:09.106
so just be prepared.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:12.631
[laughing]

01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:17.636
Hey, sorry I'm late, crew.

01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:19.725
Almost got run over
by a reindeer...

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:21.074
[laughing]

01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:23.294
[titters falsely]

01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:24.295
I'll tell you what.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:25.513
Why don't we just leap

01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:27.776
right into Elise's
Surprise Santa present

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.866
for us all?

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:31.171
Absolutely!

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:33.695
Thank you, Elise,

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:36.437
for building such a fun company
to work at.

01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:40.702
Ah, okay, that's...
that's not exactly what I meant.

01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:41.703
You know what?

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:45.316
Why don't we all
check our emails?

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.884
Huh? Everyone!
Check your emails!

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.059
[phones chime, vibrate]

01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:58.155
What's the
Mistletoe Promise?

01:05:08.165 --> 01:05:11.255
He ransacked my emails.

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:15.781
Well, I mean,
I found it on the server.

01:05:15.824 --> 01:05:17.609
Randomly.

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:18.653
[Elise]:
The server...

01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:21.700
that hasn't been working
until now?

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:33.059
Elise...

01:05:33.103 --> 01:05:34.060
Oh, my God...

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:35.105
Elise!

01:05:38.195 --> 01:05:39.979
I am really, really sorry.

01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:45.071
What happened?

01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:47.465
Me.

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:48.727
I haven't happened,

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.207
and I haven't been happening
for years.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.994
My life is frozen in a personal
and professional stupor.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.604
My life is strictly business.

01:05:56.648 --> 01:05:58.606
It's strictly business
and that's all it is,

01:05:58.650 --> 01:05:59.738
and even in that,

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:02.349
I've let down my family
and my friends

01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:04.482
and my company and myself.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:05.962
You haven't let me down, Elise.

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:09.835
No, I haven't.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:13.447
I always honor my contracts.
I just...

01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.147
forgot to do one with myself.

01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:21.368
You don't have to go
to New York, Elise.

01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:22.456
I would totally understand.

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:27.287
No.

01:06:27.331 --> 01:06:28.636
We're going to go to New York,

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.118
and we're going to get you
your partnership...

01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:36.731
because it will feel good
to do something right,

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:40.213
just one thing right
for someone...

01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:42.085
but I'm sorry,
I have to be alone.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.435
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:49.396
Elise...

01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:14.769
Hi. This is Holly.
You know what to do.

01:07:30.872 --> 01:07:32.831
[Nick]: All right,
okay, here we are.

01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:37.531
I can't believe I'm apologizing
twice inside of 24 hours.

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:38.793
First, my car died,

01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:40.578
and then I couldn't
find my charger, so...

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.101
[Ashley]: Make excuses
in the car.

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.102
We may actually
miss your flight.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.103
Hi, Elise.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:46.149
Hi.

01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:47.933
Okay, there's
a freeway entrance right here.

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:49.456
So just turn,
turn, turn, turn!

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:52.111
Going that way this
time in the morning?

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:54.244
Just strap in, buster.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:55.636
You all right
back there, Elise?

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.116
I'm fine, yes.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.552
It's not bad
heading that direction.

01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:00.032
Do I have to get
a pair of earbuds

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:01.599
to drown you out,
Nicholas?

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:06.082
We're here!

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:12.784
At this point,
winning might be everything.

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:14.612
I know.
Fingers crossed.

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.135
You're good.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.310
You've got your lucky charm

01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:18.136
and secret Christmas weapon
with you.

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:21.053
Okay.

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:29.496
[Nick]: All right.
Here we are.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.149
[Elise]: Okay.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.151
Okay.

01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:35.111
Wow.

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:36.154
Whoa.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:37.591
Yeah.

Ah, music!
All right.

Yes, yes.

This has been the best deal
I've ever struck.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.666
I have actually
enjoyed Christmas.

01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:40.323

not so family-iconic, is it?

Uh, no.

for this job,

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:05.685
was being tortured
by Christmas carolers.

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:07.687
[laughing]

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:08.819
So, I could tell

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.647
that she was the kind
of person

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:12.736
that was not particularly
fond of Christmas...

01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:13.867
[laughing]

01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:14.781
No, no, no,

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.087
but I can't take credit

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.959
for how this incredibly
brave woman

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:22.310
showed up for herself
and her life.

01:13:22.354 --> 01:13:23.747
We made a contract
to buddy-breathe

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.488
through Christmas.

01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:26.880
Two Christmaphobes!

01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:31.102
Yes, it was that simple,
that silly, and...

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:32.146
well, that profound.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.322
And what happened
to her?

01:13:34.366 --> 01:13:35.846
Well, I hear
she's doing great

01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:37.325
in all aspects
of her life.

01:13:37.369 --> 01:13:38.762
Even in love?

01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:39.980
Yes... so I hear.

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:44.855
So... to love...

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.204
to our families...

01:13:46.247 --> 01:13:47.205
and to Christmas.

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:48.641
To Christmas!

01:13:48.685 --> 01:13:50.034
Cheers!

01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:51.514
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:07.355
I... actually have
a surprise for you.

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:08.618
Come on!

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:11.447
No, come on.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:15.494
[Elise]: Really?

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:16.495
Yes!

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:26.157
You make Christmas
fun for me.

01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:30.553
I think
we both did that.

01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:33.077
Making a pact,
scaring off carolers...

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.166
Picking out ornaments,
picking out a tree,

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:36.210
stringing lights...

01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:38.169
So many presents.
Too many presents.

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:40.519
Oh, never enough!

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.390
I could build
snowmen all year.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.393
Fun like this.

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:48.919
Fun like us.

01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:01.540
It's not just fun.

01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:03.542
It's more than that.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:04.543
It's my heart,

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:07.111
and it's yours, too.

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:08.242
I know.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.417
No, you don't.

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.941
I don't think
that you really know.

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:13.073
We made it clear.

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:14.684
We had a contract.

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.990
Nothing too deep.

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:20.733
We made a promise, Elise,
not a contract.

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:22.648
We made a promise.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.694
Yes, and I intend
to keep it as written,

01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.434
because that is
what you wanted,

01:15:26.478 --> 01:15:28.436
and I am so ready

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.047
to be that woman
in the story

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.352
that you told tonight,

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:35.052
but we've had
the best fake relationship ever.

01:15:35.095 --> 01:15:39.317
All the ups and downs,
without any of the risks.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.666
Business is a risk.

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.321
No, love...

01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:46.324
love is a risk.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.807
Business is
something we do...

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:53.636
I'm really good at it.

01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:06.344
Nick...

01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:07.432
you're so close,

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:09.303
and you deserve
to be partner,

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:11.697
not because
of some lie,

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.612
or some rules that
we have to bend or break,

01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:15.658
but because
you deserve it.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.574
So just trust me
on this.

01:16:25.972 --> 01:16:28.627
Do... you have a key?

01:16:31.108 --> 01:16:32.457
I'm going to take a walk.

01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:35.678
Good night.

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.114
Good night.

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:47.690
See, we didn't realize
they speed the gondolas up

01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:49.909
when they're closing
the ski park.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.390
We thought
we had plenty of time to finish.

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.521
[laughing]

01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:57.874
You've never been married, Nick?

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:04.315
Well, um...

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:06.447
I was set to,
but...

01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:09.450
my third Christmas ghost.

01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:13.629
It was autumn...

01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:14.673
the worst time
to get married,

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:15.631
someone told me
after the fact.

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.285
I was in my tuxedo,

01:17:18.329 --> 01:17:22.202
and I was the happiest
I had ever been...

01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:24.640
Far happier than my bride-to-be,
as it turned out,

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.207
who had her father drive her
away from the church.

01:17:30.384 --> 01:17:32.865
It was the loneliest
Christmas of my life.

01:17:34.954 --> 01:17:36.347
So I switched
to divorce law,

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.742
because I wanted to be the guy
who could make it...

01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:42.135
easier, gentler

01:17:42.179 --> 01:17:44.137
for those people
going through breakups.

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:47.140
Nick...

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:50.535
You're a good man.

01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:54.147
Win this as yourself.

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:02.460
I met Elise three weeks ago.

01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:04.027
I approached her
with a contract

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.420
to rescue me from
losing out on partnership

01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:08.248
because...

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:09.641
I don't have a wife.

01:18:10.947 --> 01:18:12.209
Nick...

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:14.733
See, I didn't come
from easy beginnings,

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:16.387
and I made a choice
to better my life

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:19.695
and my situation,

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:20.783
and I think that makes me

01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.698
a valuable asset
to this firm, sir...

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:26.527
but all due respect...

01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:29.617
I don't agree with the premise
or the policy

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.968
that families and marriage

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:34.492
are the only way to promote
goodness in the world.

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:38.757
Virtue and dignity...

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:42.065
comes from all
aspects of life.

01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:46.765
Elise here is divorced,

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:49.594
and she has...

01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:52.728
more grace,
more empathy

01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:54.991
than I ever thought
possible.

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:56.253
Nick, this really isn't...

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:57.558
No.

01:18:57.602 --> 01:18:59.604
You're the woman
from Nick's story last night.

01:18:59.647 --> 01:19:02.694
In part, yes.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.261
Um...

01:19:04.304 --> 01:19:07.438
A lot of parts of my life
are still unsettled...

01:19:08.831 --> 01:19:10.354
but I can tell you this...

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:15.402
you will never find a man
with a truer heart than Nick's.

01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:16.882
He makes the world his concern,

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:20.016
and I have seen it
time and time again...

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.412
but this is a business luncheon.

01:19:27.023 --> 01:19:29.590
I really have no place here now.

01:19:31.244 --> 01:19:32.637
Please excuse me.

01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:40.732
[Nick]: So...

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.082
I'm sorry for wasting
all your time.

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:49.045
Hey! Elise!

01:19:49.088 --> 01:19:50.394
Wait!

01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:51.569
Nick,
what are you doing?

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:52.918
Just go back in
and close the deal, okay?

01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:54.920
No, no...
the deal is here.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.487
I broke the contract.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.750
I got too deep
and fell in love.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.056
Both of you, please,

01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:01.709
would you come back
to the table?

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:03.276
Mr. Willison insists.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.277
Sharon, Sol,

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:06.802
thank you for your kindness,

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.978
but I really must catch a plane.

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.165
[chuckles]

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:25.211
Honestly, Drew...

01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:27.213
you did me a favor, girl.

01:20:28.475 --> 01:20:29.433
[Holly]:
Yes.

01:20:29.476 --> 01:20:31.478
She did.

01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:41.575
I've waited four years
for you to realize that.

01:20:46.754 --> 01:20:49.366
I am so sorry, Holly.

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.672
No, hon, I am.

01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:54.458
Sometimes, the best friend
is the one who hangs back

01:20:54.501 --> 01:20:56.373
and lets you figure things out
for yourself.

01:20:57.548 --> 01:20:59.202
I think I just needed to...

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:01.726
to do something crazy.

01:21:01.769 --> 01:21:03.859
Yes, you did...

01:21:05.469 --> 01:21:09.995
and we all thought
it was brave and cool and...

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:13.303
as Zoey puts it,
"He's dreamy beyond words."

01:21:13.346 --> 01:21:14.652
[laughing]

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:18.047
[sighs]

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.831
So...

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.877
you ready to let Dan
have this place?

01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:25.793
I go where you go.

01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:28.013
Just don't sign
a non-compete clause, please.

01:21:28.057 --> 01:21:29.014
Never.

01:21:29.058 --> 01:21:30.973
Top of my buy-out demands...

01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:34.585
well, our buy-out demands.

01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:37.762
There's something

01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:40.199
that I wanted
to tell you in person.

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:42.332
Your Reindeer Report
has been getting

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:43.899
a lot of philanthropy calls.

01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:45.117
What?

01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:47.163
Do-gooders want to fund

01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:48.904
our History Kids Charity
Outreach Program.

01:21:50.122 --> 01:21:51.080
Are you serious?

01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:51.950
Yes!

01:21:51.994 --> 01:21:55.040
Oh, my God!

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:56.650
That is the best present ever!

01:21:59.001 --> 01:22:00.959
Zoey's compiling a file
right now.

01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:04.658
We might have
a lot to celebrate next year.

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:06.008
I can't believe it.

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:07.270
Come to my folks'
tonight.

01:22:08.575 --> 01:22:09.837
We're making duck.

01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:11.752
Oh, sweetheart,
you know I'd love to,

01:22:11.796 --> 01:22:13.189
but I have...

01:22:13.232 --> 01:22:15.017
I have a lot of
work to finish.

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:17.976
Plus, it's snowing out,

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.587
and I think
I might want to walk home in it.

01:22:22.807 --> 01:22:24.852
After all,
it's almost Christmas.

01:22:33.383 --> 01:22:34.775
You're the best.

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:37.996
Merry Christmas.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.258
Merry Christmas.

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:27.524
Three snow persons?

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.009
I'm so sorry, Nick.

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:35.793
No.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:37.229
You showed up.

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:38.839
You went the distance
of the contract like a pro.

01:23:40.058 --> 01:23:41.059
Mr. Willison said

01:23:41.103 --> 01:23:43.061
it was the best
run for partner

01:23:43.105 --> 01:23:44.671
he has seen
in his long career.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.067
You made partner?

01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:50.068
We did.

01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:52.201
Teamwork.

01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:53.593
Just like you said.

01:23:59.947 --> 01:24:01.645
This feels nice.

01:24:01.688 --> 01:24:02.689
It does.

01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:10.784
It's what I was scared of.

01:24:10.828 --> 01:24:12.743
I think we both were.

01:24:18.227 --> 01:24:20.403
[Elise]: Nick, I don't think
that I'm ready for a parson,

01:24:20.446 --> 01:24:23.797
but I could...

01:24:23.841 --> 01:24:26.278
sure use
some figgy pudding.

01:24:26.322 --> 01:24:28.454
Well, he'll be back again
next year, I hear...

01:24:30.282 --> 01:24:32.110
and this will do for now,
I think.

01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:36.854
So...

01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:41.772
should we extend our agreement
in perpetuity, perhaps?

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.254
I can agree to that.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:52.739
[laughs]

01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:54.611
Mistletoe.

01:24:54.654 --> 01:24:56.395
Promise.
