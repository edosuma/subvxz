to get to that point.

sitting right here
and saying that

45:47.971 --> 45:49.895

- Why would I lie about

45:56.662 --> 45:57.828
that one piece?
- Hold on, Michael, Michael.

45:57.981 --> 45:59.163

about everything else.

your communication.

- And so is forgiveness.

Jasmina, are you willing
to forgive and move on

I know it's only been just
less than two weeks, but...

55:28.993 --> 55:32.402
- We talked about how many
children we'd like to have.

55:32.555 --> 55:34.054
- Okay.
- So we definitely are on

55:34.073 --> 55:35.980
the same page
about having children,

55:36.075 --> 55:37.315
but the number of children

55:37.335 --> 55:38.892
is a little bit different.
- All right.

55:38.911 --> 55:40.151
Let's talk--let's
talk a little bit about

55:40.171 --> 55:42.153
this whole kid thing
'cause I--I know

55:42.173 --> 55:44.414
that you want three kids.
- I want three kids, yeah.

55:44.508 --> 55:45.749
- Okay, and you?

55:45.901 --> 55:47.084
- So I went into this--

55:47.236 --> 55:48.344
Or I've been in my head

55:48.571 --> 55:51.162
thinking two kids is
pretty ideal for me.

55:51.182 --> 55:53.423
I kind of approached
her and was like,

55:53.576 --> 55:55.333
the number of children,
you know,

55:55.353 --> 55:58.261
shouldn't we,
to a degree, play it by ear?

55:58.414 --> 56:00.022
We can target three, but what if

56:00.173 --> 56:01.748
we get to two and realize,

56:01.767 --> 56:04.026
you know, whether it's
the amount of resources,

56:04.177 --> 56:06.010
love, time, energy.

56:06.030 --> 56:07.588
Oh, it makes sense
to stick with two.

56:07.606 --> 56:11.015
And she just kind of was
looking at me like...

56:11.035 --> 56:12.442
Dead set on three.

56:12.595 --> 56:13.760
For me, it's also like,

56:13.779 --> 56:15.037
I've worked in
special needs before.

56:15.188 --> 56:16.780
If a child requires more--

56:16.874 --> 56:19.616
Even more energy than we had
planned, we can't just--

56:19.768 --> 56:21.602
Oh, we gotta do three
because we said so, right?

56:21.620 --> 56:24.046

you just--we just don't know,

56:24.197 --> 56:25.789
there's so many unknowns.
- What do you think about that?

56:25.941 --> 56:27.532
Or--or are you still
set in stone

56:27.551 --> 56:30.794
that it must be three?

56:30.946 --> 56:32.537
- There's a lot of things
that I will budge on

56:32.631 --> 56:36.374
and that I will compromise on,
but this is something that I...

56:36.394 --> 56:38.285
- You won't compromise?
- No.

56:51.984 --> 56:53.575

56:53.727 --> 56:56.561
- Yeah, I grew up with, like,
three children in my family.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.229
And, like, most of my cousins
and everyone

56:58.249 --> 56:59.973

56:59.992 --> 57:01.808
And it's
just worked really well.

there's a special needs kid

- Yeah.

people have ideas,

57:36.028 --> 57:38.512

57:38.530 --> 57:41.682
but you have to always
allow for possibilities.

57:41.700 --> 57:43.107
- Mm-hmm.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.943
- Have you guys
talked about finances?

57:44.962 --> 57:46.795
- Yeah,
when we initially brought up

57:46.947 --> 57:48.538
this conversation,
we were talking about children

57:48.691 --> 57:50.299
and I said,
"Well, children are expensive.

57:50.450 --> 57:52.526
"And I know you want kids
and that's wonderful,

57:52.544 --> 57:54.528
but kids cost money,
they're expensive."

57:54.546 --> 57:57.214
So, you know, that got
us into the conversation

57:57.366 --> 57:59.958

where he was at right now.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.536
Like, what do you,
like, do for work?

58:02.554 --> 58:04.387
- I worked as a sales engineer.

58:04.540 --> 58:05.481
- Oh, cool.
- So that's what I was doing

58:05.632 --> 58:07.040
prior to December.

58:07.059 --> 58:10.043
Around that time,
there was a round of layoffs.

58:10.062 --> 58:11.302
- Mm.
- So since then,

58:11.322 --> 58:14.156
I actually went on
this huge road trip.

58:14.307 --> 58:16.399
And then I was gonna figure
out what I was doing next.

58:16.552 --> 58:18.735
- It's a little scary for me.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.829
If I'm being honest.
- Why--and it's scary because?

58:21.056 --> 58:22.981
- It's scary for me because
I don't want

58:23.000 --> 58:24.574
to have to worry about money.

58:24.727 --> 58:26.409

1:08:41.952 --> 1:08:43.267
- You do have to let him

1:08:43.286 --> 1:08:44.768
fix some things on his own.
- Absolutely.

1:08:44.788 --> 1:08:47.029
I told him, for sure.
- And not take over his life.

1:08:47.182 --> 1:08:48.957
But did you hear what he said
a moment ago?

1:08:49.184 --> 1:08:51.626
He said, "I don't feel like
I'm in my own skin."

1:08:51.777 --> 1:08:53.536
- I know, and I see that.
- Lindsey,

1:08:53.688 --> 1:08:56.539
but you don't want that!
- No, and I see that.

1:08:56.633 --> 1:08:58.782
I just want you to see that.
- You don't want your husband

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:02.028
to feel like he's being
smothered or being inhabited.

1:09:02.121 --> 1:09:04.213
That he's being taken over by

1:09:04.366 --> 1:09:05.789
by an alien!
- Also he's not in his own skin

1:09:05.809 --> 1:09:07.867
because he's been plucked
out of his comfort

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:09.793
and put into this--
- No. Because--no,

1:09:09.813 --> 1:09:11.813
he feels like he's not
in his own skin

1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:14.816
because he feels as though
you are taking him over.

1:09:15.043 --> 1:09:16.634
- Is that what you feel?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:17.894
- 'Cause I feel like
you're not in own skin

1:09:18.046 --> 1:09:19.154
'cause you're in chaos.
- No! No!

1:09:19.305 --> 1:09:20.638
- Listen to what
he's saying here.

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:23.883
Because you know you're a lot,
all right?

1:09:23.976 --> 1:09:27.069
You have to give yourself
to him in doses.

1:09:27.164 --> 1:09:30.331
He needs time to at least
process what you've done

1:09:30.558 --> 1:09:33.059
or process,
and then you pull back,

1:09:33.077 --> 1:09:37.172
let him process that,
then you can move forward.

1:09:37.323 --> 1:09:38.631
What is it that you need
from him?

1:09:41.069 --> 1:09:42.752
- You need to put gas
in your tank.

1:09:42.904 --> 1:09:44.995
There's a difference between
pulling back

1:09:45.015 --> 1:09:46.406
and pulling out,
and I'm telling you,

1:09:46.499 --> 1:09:48.183
I feel like you've pulled out.

1:09:48.334 --> 1:09:51.502
- Yeah, she needs to be
affirmed.

1:09:51.596 --> 1:09:52.929
- Thank you. That's it.

1:09:53.023 --> 1:09:54.096
- And she needs to know
that you're still in it.

1:09:54.249 --> 1:09:56.933
- It's a marathon, not a sprint.

1:09:57.085 --> 1:09:58.676
- It is, but understand,
marathon and sprint,

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:00.344
you both are at least running.
- Right.

1:10:00.438 --> 1:10:01.921
Just at different speeds.

1:10:02.014 --> 1:10:03.773
Okay? But you're both running.

1:10:03.867 --> 1:10:05.533
- Right.
- Understand

1:10:05.685 --> 1:10:07.184
that she's coming to you

1:10:07.204 --> 1:10:09.204
from a very pure,

1:10:09.355 --> 1:10:10.872
loving place.

1:10:11.023 --> 1:10:13.433
- You can't hold yourself back
'cause you're afraid

1:10:13.451 --> 1:10:16.211
of what I'm gonna react to.

1:10:16.438 --> 1:10:18.604
You're not giving me
a fair chance at that point.

1:10:18.623 --> 1:10:21.198
And you're not giving yourself
a fair chance, truly.

1:10:21.218 --> 1:10:23.534
Give me the benefit
of the doubt.

1:10:23.628 --> 1:10:25.220
- That's a benefit.

1:10:25.447 --> 1:10:28.781
Our spouses are supposed to
benefit us.

1:10:28.874 --> 1:10:31.559
You're saying
that she's a lot, okay?

1:10:31.786 --> 1:10:33.636
And I'm not gonna lie.
She is a lot.

1:10:33.788 --> 1:10:35.805
Accept the fact
that she's a lot.

- I went into this process
knowing that

1:10:45.316 --> 1:10:47.650
I don't know the person,
but there's all the layers

1:10:47.802 --> 1:10:50.561

I know there's been some...
some trouble in paradise.

1:12:28.586 --> 1:12:30.828
Major, major, major issues.

1:12:30.847 --> 1:12:33.239

of everything that's going on

1:12:33.257 --> 1:12:35.165

1:12:35.259 --> 1:12:36.592

1:12:36.686 --> 1:12:39.002
is that...

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:42.690
Alyssa, I think,
from the wedding night,

1:12:42.917 --> 1:12:45.585
she thinks, I think,
from the few days after,

1:12:45.603 --> 1:12:48.529
has no interest
in being married to me.

1:12:48.756 --> 1:12:50.256
She said that we're not
compatible,

1:12:50.349 --> 1:12:52.182
she's used the phrase
"robbed, gypped,"

1:12:52.202 --> 1:12:55.519
and it started the night
of the wedding.

1:12:55.613 --> 1:12:57.020
- What about you, Alyssa?

1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:00.266
When did you first feel
disappointed?

1:13:00.284 --> 1:13:02.101
- Mm-hmm.

1:13:02.194 --> 1:13:03.953
You know, when I first saw him,

1:13:04.047 --> 1:13:05.955
I was like, okay, I don't
think that that's like

1:13:06.107 --> 1:13:08.049
my physical type.
[sniffling]

1:13:08.276 --> 1:13:10.551
I could have walked away
then, but I didn't.

1:13:10.703 --> 1:13:13.279
Because, you know,
I was like, okay,

1:13:13.372 --> 1:13:15.539
let's see why we were matched

1:13:15.558 --> 1:13:18.451
and let's see what's,
you know, going on.

1:13:18.544 --> 1:13:22.455
And then I think I started to

1:13:22.548 --> 1:13:24.306
get a little bit like nervous

1:13:24.459 --> 1:13:26.901
when I started, like,
hearing his friends

1:13:27.128 --> 1:13:29.553
tell me things and like
things from his family.

1:13:29.647 --> 1:13:32.723
And I think that was like
when I first started to be like

1:13:32.817 --> 1:13:34.742
"Oh my God," like...

1:13:34.969 --> 1:13:38.638
what did I get myself
into, kind of.

1:13:38.656 --> 1:13:41.732
- Did you guys talk in depth
about these things?

1:13:41.751 --> 1:13:44.401
- No, 'cause, like,
too many things kept happening.

1:13:44.421 --> 1:13:46.754
I just felt
like I kept getting, like,

1:13:46.906 --> 1:13:48.589
pushed down in the ocean

1:13:48.741 --> 1:13:50.650
by, like, a cinder block
or something

1:13:50.743 --> 1:13:52.001
and I like, could not get out.

1:13:52.153 --> 1:13:53.002
- You couldn't swim.
You couldn't get out.

1:13:53.154 --> 1:13:55.488
- I mean, I know that, like,

1:13:55.506 --> 1:13:58.174
I came into today

1:13:58.326 --> 1:14:00.843
wanting to try and work
on things

1:14:00.995 --> 1:14:04.087
and see what we can do.
- Okay.

1:14:04.182 --> 1:14:08.017
- Um, I felt like--and I hoped
that we could have gotten

1:14:08.169 --> 1:14:10.169
to a place, and, like,
I saw glimmers of it,

1:14:10.188 --> 1:14:12.354
like when we were
paddleboarding, like I said,

1:14:12.507 --> 1:14:14.674
I felt like we had a good time,

1:14:14.767 --> 1:14:15.783
and when we were playing tennis,

1:14:16.010 --> 1:14:17.677
I felt like we had
this good thing going

1:14:17.770 --> 1:14:19.361
and we could chat, and then--

1:14:19.514 --> 1:14:21.956
- Alyssa, but I gotta--
Hold on, honey.

1:14:22.107 --> 1:14:23.124
I gotta help you here,

1:14:23.275 --> 1:14:24.292
because even
on the wedding night,

1:14:24.519 --> 1:14:25.275
you didn't want to go
to the suite.

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:27.687
- No.

1:14:27.705 --> 1:14:29.855
The "sharing the bed" thing
has just, like,

1:14:29.874 --> 1:14:31.691
never been something
I've been comfortable with,

1:14:31.709 --> 1:14:32.967
no matter who the person is.

1:14:33.194 --> 1:14:34.802
- But you do know
that you were getting married.

1:14:34.954 --> 1:14:35.970
- No, I know.

1:14:36.121 --> 1:14:37.379
- You get married,

1:14:37.532 --> 1:14:38.789
you go on your honeymoon,

1:14:38.883 --> 1:14:40.791
and you move in together.

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:42.810
You don't go on a honeymoon
and then say, "Okay, fine,

1:14:42.962 --> 1:14:44.537
"I'm gonna stay here four weeks,

1:14:44.555 --> 1:14:46.481
"you stay there four weeks,

1:14:46.708 --> 1:14:47.631
because we have
to get acclimated."

1:14:47.725 --> 1:14:50.209
That's not marriage.

1:14:50.228 --> 1:14:52.878
I mean, I'll quote
from his perspective.

1:14:52.972 --> 1:14:54.655
You were already showing
a pattern

1:14:54.807 --> 1:14:57.825
of not wanting to be around him.

1:14:57.977 --> 1:14:59.735
- There are many reasons

1:14:59.829 --> 1:15:03.164
why sharing this apartment
isn't ideal for me.

1:15:03.391 --> 1:15:05.833
Number one, we both have
two big dogs.

1:15:07.912 --> 1:15:09.245
- Yeah?
- Name is Lily.

1:15:09.397 --> 1:15:10.505

1:15:12.342 --> 1:15:13.799
- Do you know where, like,
she originally...

1:15:20.165 --> 1:15:22.183
- Number two, I am allergic
to dogs,

1:15:22.410 --> 1:15:25.261
which I'm not sure
if you know that or not.

1:15:25.413 --> 1:15:28.097
I am not super allergic
to Penelope anymore

1:15:28.249 --> 1:15:29.673
'cause I've been around her
for ten years.

1:15:29.692 --> 1:15:31.751
New dogs.
A husky has a lot of hair,

1:15:31.844 --> 1:15:34.436
