00:14.800 --> 00:16.631
[siren blaring]

00:22.060 --> 00:24.051
[siren continues blaring] [Tuck] Over here! Help!

00:35.780 --> 00:37.486
Quick, hurry!

00:37.570 --> 00:39.777
Hurry up! This way!

00:40.620 --> 00:41.746
Hurry!

00:48.330 --> 00:50.958
-Ma'am. Ma'am?
-What's wrong with her?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.290
We don't know yet, son.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.217
Pinpoint pupils.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.540
Do you know what kind of drugs
she was taking?

00:56.630 --> 00:59.349
-Resp in the toilet. You wanna intubate?
-No, let's bag her first.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.017
[woman] Go ahead. Give it to her.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.646
[Tuck sobbing] Is she dead?

01:22.950 --> 01:24.497
[snorting]

01:26.660 --> 01:28.161
[sniffles]

02:09.210 --> 02:10.871
[chattering]

02:21.680 --> 02:24.251
Hey, Eddie, you got any Oxy?

02:25.010 --> 02:26.637
No Ow. Got some H, though.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.632
-I don't want that shit.
-Well, suit yourself.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.895
Wait.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.246
Fly safe.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.677
[knock on door]

03:00.760 --> 03:04.799
I’m stronger than a locomotive
Yea/7...

03:06.350 --> 03:07.840
[chuckles] Eddie, what's up?

03:07.930 --> 03:09.670
-[Eddie] Hey, man.
-Wanna hit it?

03:09.770 --> 03:10.589
Nah, I'm good, man.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.555
-[man] How much?
-Half-load.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.397
Why I’m so weak for you

03:21.030 --> 03:25.729
I can leap ta// bUIYo’mgs

03:26.280 --> 03:28.942
Huh. In a 5/hg/e hound

03:32.960 --> 03:35.281
-What you do with your profits?
-Shit, I don't know, man.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.497
-Spending it.
-You smart, you get in the market.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.796
-No, I think I'm good, man.
-You sure?

03:42.880 --> 03:45.178
-Yeah, dude. I gotta run. Marco.
-Hey.

03:45.260 --> 03:49.048
They call me the Superman of /0 ve
Yeah

03:51.100 --> 03:53.091
[chattering]

03:58.270 --> 04:00.181
-Fuck, yeah.
-What?

04:00.280 --> 04:01.816
My broker told me
to short Weight Watchers,

04:01.900 --> 04:04.277
and it just went down 12%. [chuckles]

04:04.360 --> 04:05.566
You got a broker?

04:05.660 --> 04:07.821
You gotta clean your money somehow, man.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.697
-Hey, look, I'll send you his email.
-Okay.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.396
-[man] Yeah, baby!
-[cheering]

04:35.480 --> 04:36.799
-It's party time!
-[man] Hit it!

05:00.420 --> 05:01.580
Morning, ladies.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.000
-We ready?
-Mm-hmm.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.176
Looking good.

05:08.510 --> 05:09.841
Call the Mexicans.

05:44.380 --> 05:46.416
Enlighten my eyes...

05:47.800 --> 05:50.598
or I shall sleep the sleep of death.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.371
[Zeke cooing]

06:48.530 --> 06:49.815
[cooing continues]

06:50.490 --> 06:51.400
[Jonah] Hey, Zeke.

06:52.910 --> 06:53.945
Want some eggs?

06:54.990 --> 06:57.197
[gasps] Hey.

06:57.790 --> 06:58.609
Marty.

07:00.580 --> 07:01.786
No, thank you.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.247
Some coffee would be great,
though, please.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.962
How long is he staying with us?

07:10.050 --> 07:12.507
Just until they can find
a suitable home for him.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.717
[Charlotte] So, people just give us
babies indefinitely?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.630
-What, like we're such the model family?
-Okay.

07:21.730 --> 07:24.267
Easy on the sarcasm. We told you.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.600
Mason asked us to help him out.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.606
[Charlotte sighs] Where you goin'?

07:36.370 --> 07:37.325
Wyatt's.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.498
I thought Ruth told you
to stay away from him.

07:40.580 --> 07:41.706
[scoffs] I don't care.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.248
In case you've forgotten, it was Wyatt
that got expelled for protecting Jonah.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.491
-[Wendy] That's not our fault.
-[Charlotte] Bullshit.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.581
-Hey.
-[Charlotte] Jonah didn't get expelled.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.756
They threw out Wyatt
because he's a Langmore.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.170
I suppose you think that that's fair.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.460
Well, none of it's fair.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.642
Jonah, would you take the baby
in the other room?

08:04.730 --> 08:05.719
I wanna talk to your father.

08:07.190 --> 08:08.259
[Jonah] Come on, buddy.

08:08.770 --> 08:10.226
Did you get any sleep?

08:11.650 --> 08:13.356
She's right about Wyatt, you know?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.151
Well, we have other problems.
Beecher's report to the commission.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.150
It's as bad as we expected.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.739
[sighs]

08:27.840 --> 08:29.740
Marty, we've gotta get ahead of this,

08:29.840 --> 08:32.161
or else the casino's
gonna go down In flames.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.256
What do you wanna do?

08:37.090 --> 08:39.092
Wilkes isn't returning my calls.

08:45.310 --> 08:46.516
[sighs]

08:48.860 --> 08:52.819
You know, I used to think
that we were, uh, different than them.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.771
You know, these people that we work for.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.360
And, um...

09:01.540 --> 09:02.359
Hey.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.905
We are different from them.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.911
You saved my life.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.797
Mason would've killed me otherwise.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.836
And you are the one who has always said,

09:15.130 --> 09:16.586
"People make choices."

09:18.430 --> 09:20.466
Mason's wife didn't have a choice.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.801
Our kids, they didn't have a choice.

09:22.890 --> 09:26.724
Okay, well, we have to concentrate
on the casino.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.768
-So, I am going to go see Wilkes.
-[cell phone ringing]

09:31.520 --> 09:32.726
-Hel|o.
-Can you look after the baby

09:32.820 --> 09:33.775
while I'm gone?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.861
Jesus, is she dead?

09:41.330 --> 09:42.615
I'll be right there.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.898
What?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.240
Rachel OD'd.

09:49.540 --> 09:50.666
I gotta go.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.347
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.347
I know you didn't sign up for this.
It's all been a nightmare.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.603
Pretty weird kidnapping
when the victim gets to keep the ransom.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.520
He gave it to us.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.568
He was going on the run, and he knew
he couldn't take care of the baby.

10:20.490 --> 10:22.867
I have no idea whether
to believe you or not.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.826
-I'm sorry you feel that way.
-Yeah.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.166
Have you heard about the Beecher letter?

10:31.250 --> 10:32.786
Oh, yeah, I heard about it.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.206
The casino's doomed.

10:36.090 --> 10:37.626
The commission will never approve it.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.756
-Unless you interceded.
-Yeah.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.506
Nope, can't do it.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.228
-[chuckles] Can't or won't?
-It's too late.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.562
What about your offer?
Is it still on the table?

10:55.650 --> 10:57.277
-Come on, Wendy.
-No, I'm serious.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.776
You would leave Marty?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.066
If it kept him safe. Him and the kids.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.789
You said you'd do anything
to get that final vote on the casino.

11:06.450 --> 11:08.281
I always wondered if you were lying.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.206
Try me.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.046
It's gone too far.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.429
[inhales sharply]

11:48.790 --> 11:51.406
[mouthing] Are you wearing a wire?

11:52.160 --> 11:54.412
[softly] Fuck you.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.450
The EMTs took it off me.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.199
Okay.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.090
I didn't know you were using.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.345
[inhales sharply]

12:10.430 --> 12:12.432
Yeah, well, it's not your problem.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.398
I'm not a fucking junkie,
so don't worry about it.

12:16.190 --> 12:19.227
Nix said that he thought
that the dope was spiked.

12:23.150 --> 12:24.310
So?

12:25.320 --> 12:27.697
So, it's not your fault, okay?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.281
None of it is.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.363
I'm really sorry
that I got you involved in all of this.

12:37.710 --> 12:41.419
Yeah, well, no offense, Marty,
but that don't really mean shit.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.045
You're right.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.764
You know, when I first came-to,
I was relieved.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.010
I was like...

12:58.360 --> 13:00.646
"Well, that's good. I didn't die."

13:02.150 --> 13:03.731
Then I was like...

13:08.450 --> 13:09.860
"What the fuck now?"

13:11.950 --> 13:12.860
Hey.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.457
What if I can get you out?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.456
The cartel doesn't know about you.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.882
I don't know. I'm just really tired.

13:28.550 --> 13:30.131
I know. I know.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.016
Then let me help.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.227
I can't fuck it up any worse.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.641
[Rachel chuckles]

13:52.160 --> 13:54.367
That's the hearse Wendy was driving in.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.708
They could've moved that dough anywhere.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.049
You think you can handle
that Keebler Elf-looking motherfucker?

14:07.090 --> 14:08.921
Only one way to find out.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.052
-Hi, Harry.
-Ruth, hi.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.049
You here for the invoices?

14:21.190 --> 14:23.397
No, I actually need to talk to you
about something.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.599
Come on in.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.691
[Ruth] Um, it's kind of weird.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.696
[beeping]

14:36.950 --> 14:37.951
Weird?

14:39.290 --> 14:41.246
Well, confidential-like.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.537
Oh. Do tell.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.081
Do you like what you do, Harry?

14:48.550 --> 14:50.962
I never wanted to be anything else. Why?

14:51.510 --> 14:52.670
Well...

14:53.180 --> 14:55.967
you know, I work in the strip club, and...

14:56.600 --> 14:59.228
I've just been thinking
about job security.

14:59.890 --> 15:04.429
I mean, that's not something
I really wanna do for the rest of my life.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.021
Not like what you do.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.811
Well, that's the thing about our business.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.652
You never run out of customers.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.400
[both chuckle]

15:14.910 --> 15:17.481
To tell the truth,
not everyone has the stomach for it.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.536
I got a pretty strong fucking stomach.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.336
Pardon my French.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.989
Why don't you come back with me?

15:26.090 --> 15:28.081
I'll show you what we do. Come on.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.580
What's the line?

15:33.090 --> 15:34.421
Eagles and three?

15:35.350 --> 15:37.170
No, fuck the spread.

15:37.260 --> 15:38.807
I told you before,
I'll tell you again, man.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.096
They just a fluke.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.432
Yeah, let me get three large
on the Browns.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.397
-[crashing]
-[man] FBI! Everybody down!

15:44.480 --> 15:45.356
[shouting]

15:45.440 --> 15:47.226
[man] Don't move!
Don't move! Don't move!

15:47.320 --> 15:49.026
[shouting continuing]

15:57.240 --> 15:59.868
-Hands! Freeze! Drop it!
-Put your hands up.

16:00.620 --> 16:05.535
The latest update is 22 fatalities,
seven more in critical condition.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.706
Fentanyl mixed with heroin.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.916
Upstairs is getting their asses kicked.

16:12.420 --> 16:15.253
No one cared as long as the minority
communities were the ones dying,

16:15.340 --> 16:17.592
but once it hit Northwestern...

16:17.680 --> 16:18.715
[man] Do we have a source yet?

16:18.810 --> 16:21.426
[woman] We're rolling up as many
mid-level and street dealers as we can.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.058
The CBS seem to be limited
to the Navarro Cartel's territory.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.550
With all due respect,
it doesn't sound like Navarro.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.777
For all you who haven't had the pleasure,
this is Agent Petty.

16:32.530 --> 16:35.272
He's been undercover down in Lake Ozark
for the past few months,

16:35.360 --> 16:38.329
that is, until one of his informants
blew his cover.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.361
Our theory is they're amping the dope
with fentanyl.

16:42.870 --> 16:44.155
Maybe they overdid it.

16:46.210 --> 16:47.666
Got a better idea?

16:48.250 --> 16:50.127
Look at it epidemiologically.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.450
If the tainted drugs were
from the Navarro Cartel,

16:52.550 --> 16:56.793
we'd see a spike in ODs in Chicago,
Milwaukee, Detroit,

16:56.890 --> 16:59.962
Cleveland and Indianapolis,
because Chicago's the hub.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.551
But right now, we have a spike in ODs
in only two places:

17:02.640 --> 17:05.222
Chicago and the Ozarks,
which indicates two things.

17:05.810 --> 17:08.688
The contaminated drugs are a small batch,

17:08.770 --> 17:11.728
and the drugs came
from the Ozarks to Chicago.

17:12.530 --> 17:13.736
[woman] Okay.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.855
Find the connection.

17:18.450 --> 17:20.577
[Harry] You can tell a lot
about a guest...

17:20.660 --> 17:23.902
I call them guests.
When you're working on them.

17:24.870 --> 17:27.327
Did they drink? Were they fit?

17:27.920 --> 17:29.785
I can even tell you their station in life.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.871
Like this guy.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.205
Had his teeth straightened.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.711
Family probably had money.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.091
[sniffs]

17:44.350 --> 17:45.590
Oh, my God.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.687
The smell of formaldehyde. [chuckles]

17:51.070 --> 17:53.971
The funny thing is people are scared
of the dead, and they shouldn't be.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.775
It's the living who can hurt you.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.190
-We don't do that.
-Sorry.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.537
Is there a bathroom I can use?

18:07.290 --> 18:10.532
Stomach not as strong as
you thought? [chuckles]

18:10.630 --> 18:12.120
Come on. I'll show you.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.665
What's in here?

18:16.760 --> 18:19.718
That's a storage room.
Just some surplus caskets.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.045
Bathroom's just down the hall.

18:28.390 --> 18:30.392
[Amos] I appreciate you bailing me out,
Ms. Pierce.

18:30.900 --> 18:31.798
I'll pay you back every penny

18:31.900 --> 18:33.811
just as soon as
we get back up and rolling.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.527
I know you will, Amos.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.698
I don't know what happened, man.
It seemed like the feds was everywhere.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.612
Come on. We'll give you a ride home.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.363
I really appreciate it,
but, uh, I can just catch me an Uber.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.991
It's no problem. It's on our way.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.166
[Wendy] You can't save the world, Marty.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.409
[Marty] I'm not trying to.

18:59.010 --> 19:03.003
I told Rachel that I'm gonna help her
get out from under Petty.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.049
Jesus.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.302
-How are you gonna do that?
-I don't know yet.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.721
You're a good man, Marty. You are.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.815
But right now,

19:21.910 --> 19:24.947
we need to get the casino over the hump,
and then we can make things right.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.861
She almost died because of what we did.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.702
Rachel almost died
because she's a drug addict.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.166
She stole from us. She informed on us.

19:36.250 --> 19:39.378
S_he_wore a wire.
At what pomt IS any of that our fault?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.967
Is there something I need to know
about you and Rachel?

19:48.970 --> 19:51.268
-[door slides]
-[Charlotte] Mom, Dad.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.345
[Wendy] Sheriff Nix, this is a surprise.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.476
Mrs. Byrde. Marty.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.679
I'm sorry to stop by so late,

19:58.780 --> 20:01.897
but I needed to ask you some questions
about Mason Young.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.349
Thank you, Charlotte.

20:04.450 --> 20:06.862
Can I get you some coffee?
Or maybe some tea, or...

20:06.950 --> 20:08.326
No, I won't be long.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.202
Social services is looking for Mason.
It seems like he's disappeared.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.746
-Oh, dear.
-Disappeared, huh?

20:17.840 --> 20:20.707
He hasn't answered his phone,
and no one's seen him.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.872
So, I thought I would check with you,
see if you knew anything.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.169
[both stutter]

20:26.260 --> 20:30.708
Well, we were contacted
by social services about the baby,

20:30.810 --> 20:34.132
but we actually hadn't spoken
to Mason in months.

20:34.230 --> 20:38.018
See, it just seems a hair strange
that you end up with his child,

20:38.110 --> 20:39.509
and then he goes missing.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.777
Yeah, well, uh...

20:44.860 --> 20:47.909
Actually, I think
it was probably the reverse.

20:48.410 --> 20:49.729
He must've gone missing

20:49.830 --> 20:52.651
after social services took the baby
into custody.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.911
So, you think he might've
done himself some harm?

20:57.420 --> 20:59.706
We know how much he loved that baby.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.506
-[Marty] Yeah.
-Which is why we wanted to get the boy

21:01.590 --> 21:04.502
out of the system as quickly as possible.
We've been waiting to hear from Mason.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.251
You didn't try to reach him?

21:06.340 --> 21:09.093
We went up to Jeff City looking for him,
but he wasn't on his regular corner.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.215
[Wendy] Mm-hmm.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.766
[Nix] Why not just call him?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.016
We didn't have his new number.

21:16.770 --> 21:17.839
[Nix] Hmm.

21:19.150 --> 21:20.356
You know...

21:22.360 --> 21:24.316
you might wanna talk to the Snells.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.481
You know they have a relationship.

21:32.330 --> 21:34.958
Yeah, I may have to do that.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.379
You know, the Snells and I,
we go back a long way.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.956
But everything has its limit.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.040
Thank you for your time.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.381
You'll let me know if you hear from Mason?

21:52.470 --> 21:55.428
-[Wendy] Of course.
-[Nix] All right. Good night now.

22:02.070 --> 22:02.968
[door closes]

22:08.360 --> 22:10.487
Why are you asking me this? [sniffling]

22:10.570 --> 22:12.151
[Helen] I don't know, Amos.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.652
Maybe because most of the ODswere
on your turf.

22:15.870 --> 22:18.828
I don't know nothing about it. Any of it.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.535
[Helen] You cut our heroin with fentanyl.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.997
You tampered with our product,
and now people are dying.

22:24.090 --> 22:26.502
I didn't. I wouldn't!

22:26.590 --> 22:28.080
[Amos sobbing]

22:28.760 --> 22:30.421
[grunting]

22:39.640 --> 22:41.187
We don't wanna do this.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.772
But we are going to find out,
one way or another.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.066
Make it easy on yourself.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.562
-What did you do to the drugs?
-Nothing.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.402
There's still some hidden
in the body shop.

22:53.990 --> 22:56.538
It's wrapped in that plastic.
That's the way it came.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.825
[choking]

23:08.470 --> 23:10.040
[gasping] Okay.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.053
I lost money on the market,
so I hit the dope.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.551
But only with inert stuff.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.345
Fentanyl?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.550
No fucking way, I swear to God.

23:22.650 --> 23:25.357
I only used 312,
and who's that gonna hurt, huh?

23:27.820 --> 23:29.230
[sniffling]

23:31.780 --> 23:33.987
I appreciate your honesty, Amos.

23:34.490 --> 23:36.981
And don't worry. It's all over now.

23:42.870 --> 23:44.576
[gasps, choking]

23:51.680 --> 23:53.545
I saw Susan Blake today.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.751
Her husband kept a file on Wilkes.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.716
He's over-leveraged.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.882
He's using his charity
as his own personal account.

24:02.980 --> 24:05.551
Now, I have a plan, butI need your help.

24:09.860 --> 24:10.986
Did you hear me?

24:13.740 --> 24:15.731
[sighs heavily]

24:17.120 --> 24:20.248
I wanted to tell Nix the truth
about Mason,

24:21.200 --> 24:22.656
just to get it over with.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.455
[sighs]

24:26.540 --> 24:28.667
That would have been a very bad idea.

24:34.180 --> 24:37.138
Well, I didn't say I was going to.
I just wanted to.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.761
So, why are we here, Marty?

25:27.560 --> 25:31.223
EMTs found a wire on Rachel.

25:32.110 --> 25:33.771
I know she was working with you.

25:34.900 --> 25:35.855
And?

25:36.610 --> 25:38.237
She's worthless to you now.

25:39.910 --> 25:42.572
It's kind of touching,
the way you care about her.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.287
I mean, she was trying to put you away.

25:45.790 --> 25:46.950
She almost died last night.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.373
I'm asking you as a human being
to let her go.

25:52.380 --> 25:55.292
You work for one of the most
vicious cartels in the world,

25:55.380 --> 25:57.587
and you're talking to me
about being human?

25:58.390 --> 25:59.709
Rachel isn't a criminal.

26:00.550 --> 26:03.053
Does your wife know
about your feelings for Rachel?

26:03.560 --> 26:07.929
Do your superiors know
that you were supplying drugs to Rachel?

26:09.520 --> 26:13.604
Just so we're clear, the drugs she OD'd on
came from your business partners.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.812
But I might be willing
to let her off the hook, if...

26:18.910 --> 26:19.774
If?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.691
I want the Snells' operation.

26:23.700 --> 26:27.363
The Snells are our partners in the casino.
I'm not aware of an operation.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.708
We think the Snells poisoned
the cartel's dope.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.829
Maybe this marriage of convenience
became inconvenient.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.080
But once the cartel figures it out,

26:37.170 --> 26:39.331
it doesn't bode well
for their partnership.

26:39.430 --> 26:43.548
So... if you really care about Rachel,

26:44.640 --> 26:47.052
you're gonna have to choose sides, Marty.

26:59.610 --> 27:01.020
What are you doing down here?

27:02.820 --> 27:03.980
I like it here.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.401
-Is the baby asleep?
-Fina|ly.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.586
Is that homework?

27:16.880 --> 27:20.122
-Do you know what gamer currency is?
-Mnh-mnh.

27:21.130 --> 27:23.212
Cyber criminals use it to launder money.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.176
I could do this.

27:28.220 --> 27:31.644
We're not looking to get into more crime,
sweetheart. We're trying to get out of it.

27:38.230 --> 27:40.482
But let me ask you a question.

27:42.740 --> 27:45.322
The account you were using,
Mike Fleming's...

27:47.330 --> 27:49.787
How did you open that
without an adult's permission?

27:52.080 --> 27:54.913
Well, I looked into some local banks,

27:55.000 --> 27:59.289
and there was one small one
that failed the stress test a few times.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.165
Not enough capital,

28:01.260 --> 28:03.717
so I figured they wouldn't look
too closely into a kid's account.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.804
So, hypothetically speaking, um...

28:09.850 --> 28:12.808
I mean, would it be possible to open
an offshore account with that?

28:13.440 --> 28:16.307
-You wanna launder money through it?
-No. No, no, no. No, of course not.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.220
I'm just wondering if it's possible.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.816
I've already done it, Mom.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.902
So, if I wanted to disguise the source
of some funds...

28:27.830 --> 28:28.899
I can do it.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.126
Just this once.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.830
[Petty] You going somewhere?

28:46.180 --> 28:47.465
Yeah, I'm going home.

28:48.050 --> 28:49.426
I'll give you a ride.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.260
I'll take a cab.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.858
You outed yourself to Marty, didn't you?

28:59.690 --> 29:02.067
You really think he's gonna rescue you?

29:04.610 --> 29:05.816
Maybe he will.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.406
You're not going home.

29:12.250 --> 29:16.823
You're being detained until I can
extradite you back to Louisiana, so...

29:22.050 --> 29:23.540
You still belong to me.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.551
[Marty] Hi. I didn't know you had a key.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.549
[Helen] We don't.

29:39.810 --> 29:41.971
[Marty] You should've called.
I would've met you here.

29:42.070 --> 29:45.813
No need.
I just wanted to talk about the accounts.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.310
I send you statements.

29:48.820 --> 29:52.733
Hmm. We're kinda like the US government.
Trust, but verify.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.992
Like this $1.8 million withdrawal
from the construction account made today

29:58.080 --> 29:59.320
caught my attention.

30:00.710 --> 30:01.745
Um...

30:03.460 --> 30:04.870
Right. Yeah, $1.8.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.748
That seems a little odd.
We haven't started building yet.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.176
We have infrastructure costs.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.638
Gas and water and power.
We gotta get it all up there.

30:15.730 --> 30:19.348
And, uh, we, uh... We took out a loan
to get things rolling.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.759
Today was the due date.

30:24.110 --> 30:25.020
Okay.

30:29.450 --> 30:33.272
I just don't want you
to confuse our money with yours.

30:34.540 --> 30:39.239
So from now on, all expenditures
over $50,000 get run by me.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.125
Okay.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.967
Uh... understood.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.618
Anything else?

30:50.590 --> 30:53.297
-The Snells.
-What about them?

30:53.890 --> 30:55.596
They spiked our dope with fentanyl.

30:56.100 --> 30:59.228
The feds are up our asses.
My client is furious with them.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.264
And?

31:01.770 --> 31:03.852
The cartel's gonna do
what the cartel does.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.067
The casino is on their land.

31:06.150 --> 31:08.892
The casino is gonna get built,
with or without them.

31:08.990 --> 31:12.153
-Helen, that's gonna be a huge problem.
-Your problem, Marty.

31:12.950 --> 31:15.532
I'm an accountant. I move numbers around.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.781
I'm a lawyer. I move words around.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.248
There are no victim_s here.
Just volunteers, right?

31:35.890 --> 31:39.132
[woman]
Follow/77g a teacher walkout
that began ten days ago,

31:39.230 --> 31:42.688
state lawmakers ﬁnal/y passed
a new education budget h/l/

31:42.770 --> 31:46.729
pro Viding, on average,
a $3, 000 raise for teachers statewide.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.063
The str/ke ends amid a wave
of teacher protests throughout the state,

31:51.150 --> 31:53.152
as reduced education. . .

31:54.740 --> 31:57.982
I tried reaching you. I made dinner.

31:59.330 --> 32:02.322
Helen Pierce, um, was curious today

32:02.420 --> 32:06.789
as to why $1.8 million was missing
from the construction account.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.950
I was gonna tell you when you got home.

32:09.050 --> 32:10.256
Okay, I'm home.

32:11.420 --> 32:14.548
I had to put something in motion
on Wilkes. I had to move fast.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.552
Did it not occur to you
to ask me first, Wendy?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.424
I did.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.432
I asked for your help.
You were more interested in Rachel.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.761
Okay, that ground
feels a little shaky to me.

32:26.860 --> 32:28.396
Look, we're gonna get most
of the money back,

32:29.400 --> 32:31.391
Do you not know
what happens to people who skim?

32:33.360 --> 32:34.657
This is not skimming.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.479
This is me trying to make sure

32:36.570 --> 32:38.947
that we build a fucking casino
for the fucking cartel,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.439
so that we all don't get killed.

32:40.870 --> 32:43.202
Now, you wanna second-guess me,
go right ahead.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.781
-What I want is to not be blindsided...
-[Zeke crying]

32:45.880 --> 32:48.121
-[Wendy shushing]
-...by having $1.8 million

32:48.210 --> 32:50.292
just mysteriously disappear.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.199
You know what?

32:51.300 --> 32:54.713
Since Mason, your priorities have been
completely upside down.

32:55.220 --> 32:58.098
Well, you seem completely unaffected
by what happened. How about that?

32:58.600 --> 33:00.636
I'm the one he kidnapped!

33:01.890 --> 33:06.338
I'm the one who he threatened to kill,
so don't you fucking tell me what I feel.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.646
[Zeke continues crying]

33:08.310 --> 33:09.470
Do you know what? Just...

33:09.570 --> 33:11.561
You take care of the baby.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.327
[Darlene] Is something bothering you?

33:23.710 --> 33:25.917
As a matter of fact, there is.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.372
Should I make you some cocoa?

33:30.460 --> 33:32.041
It was you, wasn't it?

33:33.880 --> 33:35.836
You spiked the product.

33:37.340 --> 33:38.500
[Darlene scoffs]

33:38.590 --> 33:39.921
What if I did?

33:42.310 --> 33:44.380
You know how many people you've hurt?

33:44.480 --> 33:45.595
[Darlene] Ugh!

33:46.190 --> 33:50.229
Some junkies who were killing themselves
with dope succeeded.

33:50.310 --> 33:53.393
So what? This is about respect.

33:54.150 --> 33:57.529
The cartel thought
they could roll right over us.

33:57.610 --> 33:59.612
Well, they don't anymore.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.827
I think you misconstrue the situation.

34:03.950 --> 34:07.454
I told you not to get involved with them.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.622
I don't answer to you, Darlene.

34:13.590 --> 34:17.128
I think you misconstrue the situation.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.835
They'll come after us.

34:20.470 --> 34:21.960
There'll be a war.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.051
We've had to fight before.

34:24.140 --> 34:26.517
I am not afraid. Are you?

34:27.230 --> 34:30.188
Yes, I am. I am afraid.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.355
Of you...

34:34.980 --> 34:36.891
and your implacable rage.

34:38.070 --> 34:39.401
Your rashness.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.403
You killed Ash...

34:44.290 --> 34:46.246
for no reason.

34:47.290 --> 34:50.077
For money, for a casino.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.951
I killed him to save you.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.162
I guess we just see things differently.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.129
[door shuts]

35:15.900 --> 35:17.527
[Zeke cooing]

35:22.910 --> 35:24.116
[Marty grunts]

35:28.790 --> 35:30.496
[sighs]

35:33.710 --> 35:34.529
Hey.

35:35.130 --> 35:37.200
[Zeke coughs]

35:39.050 --> 35:40.039
You okay?

35:43.050 --> 35:44.096
Morning.

35:56.730 --> 35:58.357
[bell ringing]

36:06.910 --> 36:08.286
Hello, Ruth.

36:08.370 --> 36:11.248
What the fuck is it now?
You already kicked out Wyatt.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.241
-Please sit down.
-You kicking out Three, too?

36:13.330 --> 36:15.878
-What, you get a family rate?
-I guess they didn't tell you.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.837
This school has had it in
for the Langmores

36:17.920 --> 36:20.161
-since my daddy's been here.
-This has nothing to do with Three.

36:20.260 --> 36:22.421
Wyatt is a good kid.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.463
Did you even read his application essay
for Mizzou?

36:26.850 --> 36:28.090
He's smart.

36:28.180 --> 36:31.229
He ain't like the rest of us.
I mean, he can go somewhere.

36:31.310 --> 36:32.880
We're letting him back in, Ruth.

36:34.730 --> 36:35.549
What?

36:35.650 --> 36:39.279
Assuming there are no further incidents,
we're rescinding the expulsion.

36:40.150 --> 36:43.779
A benefactor made a very eloquent case
on his behalf.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.327
-Who?
-Well, I can't tell you.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.229
He prefers it that way.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.321
Make sure Wyatt's back on Monday.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.160
[mouths] Okay.

37:10.390 --> 37:11.209
Hey, boss.

37:11.810 --> 37:12.720
What's up?

37:12.810 --> 37:15.688
[Rettelsdorf] Well, some interesting news.

37:18.230 --> 37:20.642
Looks like the right-to-work initiative's
gonna make it on the ballot.

37:20.730 --> 37:22.140
Mmm! About time.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.982
And a lot of pushback from the unions,
big surprise.

37:26.280 --> 37:30.569
And a $1.8 million donation was made
to the foundation.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.781
-That's generous.
-Yeah, with some strings.

37:33.870 --> 37:36.452
Half goes to the Wilkes Foundation,

37:36.540 --> 37:39.782
a third passes through
to the Blake Foundation,

37:39.880 --> 37:42.917
and the rest goes
to some hurricane victims charity.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.659
600K to Blake?

37:46.300 --> 37:49.007
-That's close to the amount we owe them.
-I know.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.307
-It smells a little.
-Who's the donor?

37:51.970 --> 37:55.224
-It's an anonymous gift.
-That's even worse.

37:55.730 --> 37:58.551
[sighs] Before you accept it,

37:58.650 --> 38:00.686
you better find out
who the hell anonymous is.

38:00.770 --> 38:01.725
[Rettelsdorf] Yeah.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.357
[Wyatt] Whoa!
They've got a ton of first editions.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.276
Look Homeward; Angel

38:07.360 --> 38:10.443
That's, like, probably
my favorite American novel ever.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.285
[exhales sharply]

38:15.370 --> 38:19.409
Excuse me.
Could you unlock that case for me? Thanks.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.833
Just be careful. These are worth a lot.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.216
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.210
You're welcome.

38:34.350 --> 38:35.385
Wow!

38:38.350 --> 38:41.478
Thomas Wolfe, huge guy. Like, 6'6".

38:41.560 --> 38:43.437
But he liked to write standing up.

38:44.070 --> 38:47.483
So, he would stand at his refrigerator
and use it as a desk.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.605
[chuckles]

38:49.280 --> 38:50.156
Crazy.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.230
[cell phone ringing]

38:56.620 --> 38:57.609
Ruth, what's up?

38:59.580 --> 39:00.490
Yeah.

39:02.790 --> 39:03.950
Okay, what's that mean?

39:09.050 --> 39:10.210
Okay.

39:12.010 --> 39:13.546
-Did she tell you who?
-[Charlotte sighs]

39:16.270 --> 39:17.726
[Wyatt] All right. Love you. Bye.

39:20.980 --> 39:23.050
I got back into school. [scoffs]

39:23.150 --> 39:24.686
-What?
-Yeah.

39:25.190 --> 39:26.316
Well, that's cool.

39:26.900 --> 39:27.810
What happened?

39:28.990 --> 39:30.139
I don't know.

39:31.490 --> 39:33.310
Ruth just said she talked to Abbott.

39:33.820 --> 39:35.617
She said someone came in
and made my case for me,

39:35.700 --> 39:37.327
and I go back on Monday.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.826
Hey, do you think it was Marty?

39:41.920 --> 39:43.160
I don't know.

39:43.250 --> 39:47.664
You think he felt guilty about my dad?
About what happened?

39:48.920 --> 39:51.332
I'm not sure I know
who my parents are anymore.

40:14.910 --> 40:16.480
[door opens]

40:20.410 --> 40:22.150
Bet you were a teacher's pet.

40:24.380 --> 40:30.626
Straight-A student. Sat in the front row.
Hair combed. Hand up first.

40:30.710 --> 40:35.636
Yeah, you'd lose that bet.
I, um... I spent fifth grade in the hall.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.962
I kept correcting the teacher's spelling.
She never appreciated it.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.597
You always thought you were
the smartest one in the room, huh?

40:42.600 --> 40:44.340
Some rooms are smarter than others.

40:48.150 --> 40:50.778
You got Wyatt back into school,
didn't you?

40:56.990 --> 41:00.369
Like being tossed out of the classroom
for knowing more than the teacher?

41:01.830 --> 41:02.956
Listen, um...

41:05.420 --> 41:09.038
I... I should've protected you
from the cartel.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.621
I know it doesn't mean much,
but I blame myself.

41:13.420 --> 41:14.421
You should.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.426
I want my office back.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.937
Anything else?

41:28.020 --> 41:29.476
It's a start. [scoffs]

41:31.610 --> 41:32.520
Turn off the lights when you leave.

41:47.290 --> 41:48.245
[door closes]

42:21.120 --> 42:22.235
You bought that?

42:23.240 --> 42:24.491
Not exactly.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.280
What did you do?

42:28.420 --> 42:30.240
What does it matter? It's yours.

42:32.590 --> 42:33.659
I don't want it.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.790
Why? What's wrong?

42:37.550 --> 42:40.758
You just don't get it.
It's like what happened at school.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.886
If you get caught,

42:41.970 --> 42:44.598
you get a slap on the wrist.
Marty pays for the book.

42:44.680 --> 42:46.261
I get caught, I go to fucking jail.

42:46.350 --> 42:49.092
[scoffs] You liked it so much,
and I wanted to get it for you, so--

42:49.190 --> 42:51.602
I just got back into school,
for Christ's sake.

42:51.690 --> 42:53.726
-I thought you hated school.
-I... [sighs]

42:54.480 --> 42:56.436
That's not what I said, Charlotte.

42:58.530 --> 43:01.613
-I'm sorry, okay? It was stupid.
-No...

43:03.490 --> 43:07.153
You just don't understand
who my family is, okay?

43:07.250 --> 43:09.536
The shit that they've done,
it's like I can't escape it.

43:09.620 --> 43:14.796
Oh, Jesus, you think you're the only one?
I saw a guy get killed in my house.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.509
I loaded money into a wall.
The fucking FBI raided us.

43:18.590 --> 43:21.423
My parents are paranoid
about anyone I hang outwith.

43:21.510 --> 43:23.751
And now we have a baby,

43:23.850 --> 43:26.057
and I know they're lying
about how they got it.

43:26.140 --> 43:29.473
A fucking baby!
It's all just so fucked up.

43:34.900 --> 43:37.061
[sighs] Why would you do that?

43:37.820 --> 43:39.811
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth?

43:46.620 --> 43:49.407
Charlotte, will you let your brother know
that dinner's ready, please?

43:50.210 --> 43:51.666
Jonah!

43:51.750 --> 43:53.627
That's great. I could have done that.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.296
[door closes]

44:01.840 --> 44:03.080
Take a seat, sweetheart.

44:03.180 --> 44:04.966
[Jonah] Sorry, I was just finishing up.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.556
What were you finishing up?

44:10.730 --> 44:12.095
Jonahis".

44:13.310 --> 44:15.722
um, creating an online profile...

44:16.570 --> 44:17.855
for Mike Fleming.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.060
What does that mean?

44:23.200 --> 44:25.316
[Wendy] We're using his account,
only temporarily.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.196
The Blake Foundation
is having a benefit tomorrow night,

44:28.290 --> 44:30.281
and we'll see if Wilkes bites.

44:30.370 --> 44:32.076
You didn't need to ask Jonah.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.872
[Wendy]
It was an emergency, and you were busy.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.671
What'd you do today, Charlotte?

44:45.260 --> 44:46.340
I stole a book.

44:47.510 --> 44:48.841
-[Wendy] You what?
-You stole a book?

44:49.350 --> 44:52.934
A first edition of
Look Homeward; Angel,
from an antiquarian bookstore.

44:53.020 --> 44:54.339
Why would you do that?

44:54.940 --> 44:58.012
[chuckles] I don't know.
Because I'm a Byrde and that's what we do.

44:58.610 --> 44:59.520
Then you return it.

44:59.610 --> 45:02.602
-It's too late. I gave it to someone.
-[Wendy] Then you need to pay them for it.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.817
You don't steal things from a store.
You know that.

45:07.910 --> 45:11.402
This is insane. You see that, right?

45:12.120 --> 45:13.326
[Zeke crying]

45:15.710 --> 45:18.998
Charlotte. Charlotte!

45:19.090 --> 45:20.489
[cell phone ringing]

45:23.720 --> 45:24.869
Hi, Helen.

45:24.970 --> 45:27.427
[He/en]
I got the link you sent
and did some digging.

45:27.510 --> 45:29.387
Check your inhox. I think you ’l/ be happy.

45:31.180 --> 45:32.670
[cell phone ringing]

45:35.100 --> 45:38.012
-[Wilkes clears throat] Yeah?
-[Rettelsdonf7
It’s me. I wake you?

45:38.110 --> 45:41.352
-[chuckles] What do you think?
-Yeah, say hello to Sherry.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.022
-5he ﬁnish your taxes yet?
-Fuck off.

45:44.990 --> 45:46.355
What do you want?

45:46.450 --> 45:49.772
Well, I paid 017’ a tel/er at the bank
that made the wire transfer.

45:49.870 --> 45:52.612
The name of the anonymous benefactor
Is Michael Fleming.

45:53.830 --> 45:56.867
[sighs] Michael--Never heard of him.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.667
Thatis because he’s a 14-year-old boy.

46:00.290 --> 46:01.245
What?

46:01.340 --> 46:04.753
E Vident/y, his father died
and left him a foundation.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.297
They need to make some bequests
for tax reasons.

46:10.430 --> 46:11.590
[Wilkes chuckles]

46:11.680 --> 46:12.590
Hello.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.669
I'm here. [grunts]

46:14.770 --> 46:15.976
What do you want me to do?

46:16.060 --> 46:17.300
-If I had more time--
-It's fine.

46:18.100 --> 46:23.220
The world needs a little bit more trust.
Just accept It. Accept the money.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.998
[Petty] There's not much to like
about the Ozarks, but, man...

46:38.080 --> 46:39.536
This French toast is...

46:42.710 --> 46:44.450
I think it's the fresh buttermilk.

46:49.010 --> 46:51.001
You gonna give me the details
of the Snell operation,

46:51.090 --> 46:52.296
or are you on your way out?

47:07.860 --> 47:10.943
[Barb]
You ’re a fucking angel.
I needed a fix, and there you were.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.985
How did you know who I was?

47:13.080 --> 47:14.866
[man]
I ’rn a friend of your son ’5.
You want me to tie you off?

47:14.950 --> 47:17.032
-[Barb]
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:18.210 --> 47:20.030
[Barb breathing heavily]

47:29.090 --> 47:30.079
[grunts]

47:35.430 --> 47:36.840
[Barb exhales]

47:38.730 --> 47:40.220
[sighs heavily]

47:40.310 --> 47:42.801
You're a fucking angel.

47:44.190 --> 47:45.350
Angel.

47:45.860 --> 47:48.021
I will fucking kill you.

47:49.190 --> 47:50.396
No, you won't.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.480
Not if you care about your mother.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.663
You're gonna let Rachel go,
and you're gonna drop all pending charges.

48:02.420 --> 48:05.207
If she gets so much as a parking ticket...

48:08.090 --> 48:09.500
You proud of yourself?

48:11.590 --> 48:13.046
Threatening a sick woman?

48:17.560 --> 48:18.549
No.

48:20.480 --> 48:21.686
Not for a second.

48:23.730 --> 48:25.857
[chattering]

48:58.600 --> 49:00.170
[Wendy] Hello, Charlie.

49:01.430 --> 49:03.307
I didn't know you had an eye for art.

49:03.940 --> 49:08.183
I don't. It's a commodity,
like everything else. Should I buy it?

49:08.770 --> 49:11.398
It's better than hog futures,
and it's for a good cause.

49:13.900 --> 49:15.447
Mind if I borrow your date?

49:16.200 --> 49:18.737
As long as you return him
in the same condition.

49:28.460 --> 49:29.745
[Wilkes sighs] What are you doing here?

49:34.170 --> 49:35.967
I heard you finally made good
on your donation.

49:36.050 --> 49:38.507
-Yeah? Where'd you hear that?
-Susan Blake.

49:39.010 --> 49:39.840
Oh, you're friends now?

49:40.470 --> 49:42.597
-We have mutual interests.
-Like what?

49:43.730 --> 49:46.016
Like making sure promises are lived up to.

49:47.350 --> 49:49.181
Are you trying to tell me something?

49:50.110 --> 49:54.399
Marty and I facilitated the donation
from Mike Fleming to you.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.659
My position has not changed on the casino.
I am still out.

49:58.740 --> 50:00.071
I assumed.

50:00.160 --> 50:03.038
Unfortunately, you just accepted
Mexican drug cartel money

50:03.120 --> 50:05.657
and helped launder it
through a Guyanese charity.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.419
That is just not a good look
for a moralist like you.

50:10.790 --> 50:12.838
We had no idea where that money came from.

50:13.420 --> 50:16.002
I'm not so sure
the FBI will see it that way.

50:16.090 --> 50:17.170
And once they start looking into

50:17.260 --> 50:20.639
how you use your own charity
as your own personal piggy bank,

50:20.720 --> 50:23.553
well, I guess you're looking at
tax evasion,

50:23.640 --> 50:24.925
wire fraud, money laundering--

50:25.020 --> 50:27.261
-You fucking set me up?
-Hey.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.897
Take a drink, Charlie.

50:30.940 --> 50:32.851
Smile. People are watching.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.566
[chuckles]

50:35.280 --> 50:36.770
You try and take me down,

50:37.530 --> 50:40.112
believe me,
I take you and Marty down with me.

50:40.700 --> 50:41.985
I don't doubt that for a second,

50:42.080 --> 50:44.196
but there's a less painful way out
of this,

50:44.290 --> 50:45.939
one where you get to keep the donation,

50:46.040 --> 50:48.031
recoupable against your piece
of the profits,

50:48.120 --> 50:51.419
and we get the casino.
Just help us get through the commission.

50:52.630 --> 50:55.952
You are one cold-hearted bitch.

51:07.730 --> 51:08.879
[Cade exhales]

51:10.230 --> 51:11.470
Let's go.

51:17.940 --> 51:19.100
[Ruth] Camera to the left.

51:23.490 --> 51:25.117
[beeping]

51:33.790 --> 51:35.667
-[doorknob jiggling]
-[Ruth] Oh, shit.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.259
[Cade grunts]

51:56.360 --> 51:57.395
[Ruth] Fuck.

52:03.820 --> 52:05.947
God damn it. Fuck.

52:06.030 --> 52:08.692
[groaning]

52:10.410 --> 52:11.240
Fuck!

52:12.460 --> 52:13.779
[grunts] Where is it?

52:16.840 --> 52:17.875
[Ruth] Maybe I just got it wrong.

52:17.960 --> 52:21.373
You're always wrong
when it comes to Marty fucking Byrde.

52:21.880 --> 52:25.668
You are like a fucking dog,
going to whoever feeds you.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.217
I saw the hearse. It has to be here.

52:28.310 --> 52:29.846
Yeah? And when was that?

52:30.560 --> 52:32.266
-How long you been holding out?
-I'm not holding out.

52:32.350 --> 52:35.183
You been leading me on this
fucking goose chase for months now.

52:35.270 --> 52:38.228
-Where the fuck's the money?
-I don't know!

52:39.440 --> 52:42.648
You know what? You're worthless to me.

52:43.660 --> 52:48.529
You're like a piece of shit
on the bottom of my shoe. Yeah.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.497
Don't say that, Daddy.

52:51.580 --> 52:52.740
[Ruth grunts]

52:54.210 --> 52:57.668
You made me do it.
When are you gonna learn?

53:00.670 --> 53:02.376
What, are you gonna cut me now?

53:03.130 --> 53:05.507
You ungrateful fucking cunt.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.140
[door shuts]

53:16.690 --> 53:18.180
[breathing shakily]

53:24.320 --> 53:26.197
[Marty] What were you running from, Buddy?

53:28.870 --> 53:29.905
Ghosts?

53:33.460 --> 53:35.166
Were they in your dreams?

53:38.080 --> 53:39.581
Did they forgive you?

54:00.440 --> 54:01.475
Bye, Buddy.

54:03.860 --> 54:05.236
I'll be seeing you.

54:07.490 --> 54:09.117
[knock on door]

54:22.460 --> 54:23.336
Hey.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.047
-Hi.
-Can I come in?

54:40.060 --> 54:41.357
How do you feel?

54:43.690 --> 54:44.770
Um, okay.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.229
Good.

54:50.990 --> 54:53.572
Petty is not going to be
bothering you anymore.

54:58.710 --> 55:00.450
How'd you get me out?

55:02.170 --> 55:03.876
He had a change of heart.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.136
What's this? That's a plane ticket.

55:20.770 --> 55:21.805
To Miami?

55:22.310 --> 55:24.767
There's a clinic there
where you can clean up.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.448
I said I wanted to help,
and this is what it looks like.

55:28.530 --> 55:29.849
Well, I can't even afford that, so...

55:29.950 --> 55:31.690
It's paid for. It's done.

55:34.830 --> 55:39.039
And this is an advance on the Blue Cat.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.783
You send me your account information,
and I'll deposit the rest.

55:47.920 --> 55:49.717
I guess I should say thank you.

55:51.470 --> 55:52.585
No.

55:55.930 --> 55:57.886
I fucked your life up pretty good.

56:03.940 --> 56:04.929
Hey, Marty.

56:09.780 --> 56:10.849
I, uh...

56:39.600 --> 56:40.726
Thank you.

56:45.270 --> 56:47.101
[children giggling]

56:47.900 --> 56:49.436
-[Reverend] Y'all take care.
-[man] Appreciate it.

56:49.530 --> 56:50.929
Wonderful sermon, Reverend.

56:51.610 --> 56:54.272
The nature of salvation.
Gave me a lot to think about.

56:54.360 --> 56:55.190
Thank you.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.238
And that fried chicken.
It must be genetic.

56:58.330 --> 57:01.288
Women around these parts
all just seem to know how to cook.

57:01.370 --> 57:03.418
-Isn't that right, Darlene?
-Mmm.

57:03.500 --> 57:04.865
Oh, it was good to see you, Darlene.

57:04.960 --> 57:05.915
Well...

57:07.290 --> 57:08.996
-good night now.
-Good night.

57:09.500 --> 57:12.799
Jesus, it's just fucking fried chicken.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.757
A cat could make it.

57:17.720 --> 57:18.709
Thank you.

57:20.270 --> 57:21.669
[engine turns over] [Jacob] Y'all got a problem?

57:56.090 --> 57:57.387
[tires screeching]

58:17.360 --> 58:19.988
[Wendy] Where have you been?
It's late. We've been worried.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.786
I have something
I wanna talk to you about.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.490
What is it?

58:36.670 --> 58:38.672
I wanna get emancipated.

58:39.590 --> 58:41.638
-What are you talking about?
-What?

58:42.140 --> 58:44.426
Do you remember Jordan Parks
from back home?

58:45.140 --> 58:48.189
He did it. He had his own apartment
when he was a senior.

58:48.850 --> 58:51.603
That kid's parents are drug addicts.

58:51.690 --> 58:54.067
-There's a difference there.
-This is silly.

58:55.150 --> 58:57.357
You'd have to pay for rent, food, clothes.

58:57.450 --> 58:58.269
I'll get a job.

58:58.360 --> 59:00.157
Where? McDonald's?

59:01.120 --> 59:02.985
You think minimum wage
would pay for all that?

59:03.080 --> 59:07.904
Charlotte, I know things have been crazy,

59:08.580 --> 59:11.037
-but we gotta stay together.
-[Charlotte] Why?

59:11.130 --> 59:12.870
We're a family.

59:12.960 --> 59:14.621
What does that even mean?

59:16.210 --> 59:18.212
I don't wanna hurt you.

59:19.010 --> 59:22.594
I love you,
but I can't be a part of this anymore.

59:23.180 --> 59:26.138
Everyone lies about everything.

59:26.810 --> 59:28.346
It's gone too far.

59:29.060 --> 59:32.223
You can fight me on this,
or you can help me.

59:35.110 --> 59:36.725
I've made up my mind.

59:39.570 --> 59:41.060
I want out.
