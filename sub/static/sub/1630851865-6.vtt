00:32.240 --> 00:34.600
What a sky, huh, Moon?

00:34.720 --> 00:37.160
You said it, Ollie!
This is the kind of sky

00:37.320 --> 00:39.680
that makes you want to sleep outside
all night

00:39.839 --> 00:41.280
under the stars!

00:42.040 --> 00:43.480
-It does?
-Uh-huh!

00:43.640 --> 00:45.960
You mean, like in the back yard

00:46.120 --> 00:47.519
and not in our beds?

00:47.680 --> 00:50.239
Yes! We should do it tonight!

00:51.040 --> 00:53.760
It'll be great, Ollie!
We can roast marshmallows

00:53.919 --> 00:55.320
and stay up way too late!

00:56.559 --> 00:57.800
Ah!

00:57.960 --> 01:00.800
It's OK, Moon. Just a little thunder.

01:00.919 --> 01:03.640
But now it's totally raining.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.840
Aw!
Silly weather ruining our camp-out fun!

01:07.960 --> 01:10.600
Oh, shucks!
I guess we'll have to do it another time,

01:10.759 --> 01:13.000
like after we've planned it
for a week to ten days.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.160
[gasps]
Ollie, I'm having a brainstorm!

01:16.280 --> 01:19.119
Uh-oh. Every time you have a brainstorm,

01:19.320 --> 01:21.160
I get dragged off somewhere.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.880
We'll go far away,
where there are wide, open skies,

01:24.039 --> 01:25.920
at the tippy-top of a mountain!

01:26.320 --> 01:29.080
Actually, the back yard
is sounding better and better.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.000
And I know just the place,

01:31.160 --> 01:34.240
the gorgeous Pyrenees Mountains of Spain!

01:34.399 --> 01:37.039
It's supposed to have some of the best
camping in the world!

01:37.199 --> 01:39.039
-Um...
-Picture it, Ollie!

01:39.199 --> 01:42.759
Amazing views,
a cloudless sky full of stars...

01:42.920 --> 01:44.360
What are we waiting for?

01:47.960 --> 01:51.199
Oh, right. We're waiting for you to pack.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.080
OK. I'll need my stuffed animals,

01:55.240 --> 01:58.240
my night lights,
my "A to Zs" music collection,

01:58.640 --> 02:01.119
and the most important thing of all...

02:04.960 --> 02:09.440
my extra-special,
one-of-a-kind red pajamas!

02:11.160 --> 02:12.680
Nothing, and I mean nothing,

02:12.840 --> 02:15.079
can ever happen to my red pajamas.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.400
When I wear these, I feel totally safe.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.920
Nothing scares me!

02:19.480 --> 02:23.040
Not the dark, nor shadows,
nor bumps in the night!

02:25.040 --> 02:27.880
Yep, this is my bedtime suit of armour.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.239
I can't sleep without them.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.959
Uh-huh. So, now are you ready?

02:32.120 --> 02:33.640
Actually... Ah!

02:41.840 --> 02:43.280
Whee!

02:50.079 --> 02:51.440
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:51.600 --> 02:55.519
<i>we are now arriving in beautiful,</i>
<i>mountainous Spain!</i>

02:55.640 --> 02:56.760
Hmm.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.079
To the mountains of Spain!

03:12.359 --> 03:14.959
Wow!
Spain is more amazing than I thought!

03:15.120 --> 03:17.560
Now to figure out how to get
to the Pyrenees Mountains

03:17.720 --> 03:18.959
for our sleep-out and...

03:19.120 --> 03:21.720
Wait!
I just have to check one thing first.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.880
I need to make sure
my red pajamas are safe!

03:24.040 --> 03:25.160
Of course you do.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.200
[he laughs]

03:26.320 --> 03:29.880
Can you imagine if they weren't?
I might never sleep again!

03:32.359 --> 03:33.160
Hey!

03:33.280 --> 03:35.640
I must have taken the wrong suitcase.

03:43.079 --> 03:43.920
[he gasps]

03:44.040 --> 03:45.000
Which means...

03:45.160 --> 03:48.399
My red pajamas are... are...

03:48.519 --> 03:49.920
gone!

03:52.040 --> 03:53.679
What do we do?

03:54.079 --> 03:55.359
Don't you worry, Ollie.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.359
We're gonna find your pajamas
and sleep under the stars

03:58.519 --> 03:59.679
just like we planned.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.119
Thanks, Moon.

04:01.239 --> 04:03.160
You always make me feel better.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.160
We've got to think this through.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.920
If you have somebody else's suitcase,

04:09.079 --> 04:11.239
then they must have yours.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.519
So they must be in town.

04:13.679 --> 04:16.240
True, but this is a big city.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.000
What are the odds that...

04:18.719 --> 04:19.800
There! My PJs!

04:22.039 --> 04:23.640
PJs!

04:26.880 --> 04:29.599
-Ahem... Ollie?
-Moon, please.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.680
I'm having a moment with the pajamas.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.360
Ahem...

04:38.479 --> 04:39.960
Not my PJs.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.320
Not your PJs.

04:41.479 --> 04:43.120
Oh! Where are they?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.440
What's going on over there?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.640
Nebbish!

04:51.520 --> 04:52.599
Whoa!

04:52.880 --> 04:53.800
My PJs!

04:54.280 --> 04:58.000
He must be the one I mixed up
suitcases with at the airport.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.599
It feels wonderful being voted
most handsome movie star bull

05:02.760 --> 05:04.120
in all of Spain.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.159
Now, please feel free to take photos

05:07.320 --> 05:09.080
of my stylish new pajamas,

05:09.240 --> 05:11.360
while I dance the flamenco.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.360
Come everyone!

05:12.520 --> 05:13.919
Excuse me.

05:14.479 --> 05:16.120
These PJs are mine.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.080
And you're stretching them out.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.760
And I need them!

05:20.080 --> 05:21.520
Hey! Come back here.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.479
Faster, Ollie! We're losing him.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.039
What are we gonna do, Moon?

05:32.159 --> 05:33.840
If I don't get those PJs back,

05:33.960 --> 05:35.800
it won't just mess up our sleep out.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.680
It'll mess up my whole life!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.680
Look at the bright side.
We know where they are.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.320
We have to get around these guys...

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I mean... We were just leaving.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.880
Bedtime is getting closer.

05:52.039 --> 05:55.800
Get ready for some traditional
Spanish flamenco dancing.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.719
We're going to spin that bull
until your pajamas fly off.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.760
Yeah!

06:02.200 --> 06:03.880
[flamenco music]

06:05.039 --> 06:06.159
[he laughs]

06:06.280 --> 06:09.880
This is it, Ollie.
He's gonna spin out of the pajamas.

06:15.359 --> 06:16.400
Whee!

06:24.120 --> 06:24.960
[mooing]

06:28.640 --> 06:29.719
[he laughs]

06:29.880 --> 06:31.440
Well, that didn't work.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.479
Look on the bright side.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.520
Wasn't that Spanish guitar music
just lovely?

06:42.039 --> 06:44.240
Moon, it's going to be dark soon

06:44.440 --> 06:45.479
and I still don't have...

06:45.640 --> 06:47.400
Oh! There he is, Ollie.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.760
Oh! I'm very interesting.

06:51.039 --> 06:52.080
Hey!

06:53.200 --> 06:55.919
He's not wearing my pajamas any more.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.760
They're gone!

06:58.200 --> 06:59.560
-Gone?
-Gone!

06:59.960 --> 07:01.840
What do we do? Moon!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.159
What's the bright side?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.400
Wait a minute. Look!

07:09.120 --> 07:12.159
Hola!
I'm Nebbish Q. Bull's personal assistant.

07:12.479 --> 07:14.239
I'll take those! <i>Gracias</i>!

07:14.840 --> 07:17.680
Yeah! Moon, that was amazing!

07:17.880 --> 07:20.039
PJs, it's so good to have you back!

07:21.719 --> 07:23.719
Stop!

07:24.359 --> 07:25.960
Was that Nebbish?

07:26.120 --> 07:28.400
Those are mine! Give them back.

07:28.799 --> 07:31.359
Sorry, but these pajamas are mine.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.159
See?
They've got my paw print on the chest.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.960
Sorry, but Ollie can't sleep without them.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.840
I've been a struggling actor
my whole life.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.760
And then,
I put those wondrous pajamas on,

07:42.919 --> 07:44.400
and they changed me!

07:44.760 --> 07:47.479
I was suddenly fabulous.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.080
Just like that.
Please, don't take them back.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.479
I'm afraid to go on without them.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.359
[sobbing]

07:55.640 --> 07:56.880
I feel bad, Nebbish.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.679
I know how scary it can be
without the PJs.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.960
But they're mine and I need them.

08:03.159 --> 08:04.320
I understand.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.640
Oh! We can't just leave him like this.

08:11.159 --> 08:13.760
-But what can we do?
-Look at the bright side.

08:13.919 --> 08:16.039
I'm having another brainstorm.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.679
[whispers]

08:18.080 --> 08:19.080
Brilliant!

08:24.919 --> 08:25.840
Tada!

08:26.359 --> 08:28.120
Really? For me?

08:28.599 --> 08:30.400
I don't know how to thank you.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.400
Would an autograph be gratitude enough?

08:33.559 --> 08:36.000
Or perhaps tickets
to my latest action movie?

08:36.159 --> 08:37.480
As soon as I make it.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.640
Moon! Your plan is working.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.640
Those fake red pajamas
sure look like yours.

08:42.959 --> 08:44.520
But they're not.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.160
I don't understand.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.880
I'm not wearing the amazing red pajamas?

08:49.199 --> 08:50.760
You only thought you were.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.160
And you were fabulous without them.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.880
I was, wasn't I?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.439
So that means

08:57.600 --> 08:59.079
that I don't need them?

08:59.240 --> 09:02.439
I think you've always had
a brave strong bull inside you.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.560
You just needed help finding him.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.880
I'll never be timid and meek again!

09:07.760 --> 09:09.439
How can I ever thank you?

09:09.720 --> 09:12.480
Actually, I can think of something.

[shrieking]

09:51.680 --> 09:54.720
Moon, it's okay. It's just some thunder.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.560
Let's go inside here.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.720
I'm scared, Ollie.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.360
I'm sorry, Moon.
But look at the bright side.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.199
You can wear my red PJs.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.360
-Huh?
-They make me feel safe.

10:06.520 --> 10:10.040
They worked for Nebbish,
I bet they'll work for you.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.520
But Ollie,
you can't sleep without your red PJs.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.240
I think I can.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.560
I think there's a brave Ollie inside me

10:17.720 --> 10:19.560
and I just needed help finding him.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.079
Here. I want you to have them.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.079
Thanks, Ollie.
You always make me feel better.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.959
Moon, look!

10:29.280 --> 10:30.839
It's magical!

10:31.400 --> 10:33.640
[Moon] Just like I thought it would be.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.040
[Stanley] Hi, guys!
I'm collecting stuff for charity.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.079
Do you have any clothes
you want to give away?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.839
Let me look, Stanley.

10:42.319 --> 10:43.880
[laughs]

10:45.199 --> 10:47.839
Oh, Ollie! These are your red PJs.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.480
I don't think you meant to give those.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.040
-What do you think, Moon?
-We'd like to donate these.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.000
They helped us feel brave and now,
we don't need them anymore.
