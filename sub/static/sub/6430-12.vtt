WEBVTT

00:00.256 --> 00:02.056
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:04.866 --> 00:06.386
Why am I having these headaches?

00:06.896 --> 00:08.916
When MacPherson was
part of your consciousness...

00:09.030 --> 00:12.030
he may have left something behind.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.410
Paris, 1899.

00:15.478 --> 00:20.048
My daughter Christina
had been murdered.

00:20.116 --> 00:22.317
H.G. Wells
is to be fully reinstated

00:22.385 --> 00:23.485
as a Warehouse Agent.

00:23.553 --> 00:24.853
Thank you, sir.

00:24.921 --> 00:26.221
And no matter
how much good

00:26.289 --> 00:27.790
she's done
for all of us,

00:27.857 --> 00:29.758
I'll never trust
that woman.

00:29.826 --> 00:31.426
Someone has found
the lost Warehouse.

00:31.494 --> 00:34.263
It was always believed to be
somewhere near Alexandria.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.430
Warehouse 2 is back online.

00:35.498 --> 00:36.865
So we need to find
Warehouse 2

00:36.933 --> 00:39.134
and shut it down.

00:42.539 --> 00:44.306
H.G., guess who just
saved the day.

00:50.747 --> 00:51.947
Myka.

00:52.015 --> 00:53.682
Myka.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.716
Myka.

00:54.784 --> 00:55.984
Myka, come on.
Pete?

00:56.052 --> 00:56.985
Come on, get up.
We gotta go.

00:57.053 --> 00:57.986
Pete, where am I?

00:58.054 --> 00:59.054
Egypt, Warehouse 2,

00:59.122 --> 01:00.155
and we are in big trouble.

01:00.223 --> 01:01.323
Big bump.

01:01.391 --> 01:02.691
I know.
I got one to match.

01:02.759 --> 01:04.358
What's that sound?
That's sand.

01:04.427 --> 01:05.561
No, I'm sorry,
scratch that.

01:05.628 --> 01:07.095
It's the whole freakin'
Sahara desert.

01:07.163 --> 01:09.898
This place is filling up
with sand, Myka.

01:09.966 --> 01:12.067
The way we came in
is history.

01:12.135 --> 01:14.069
I don't know,
when H.G. bolted

01:14.137 --> 01:16.872
she must have triggered some
kind of self-preservation thing,

01:16.940 --> 01:18.473
something that protects
the artifacts.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.275
H.G., she played us!
She played me!

01:20.343 --> 01:21.276
Oh, big time.

01:21.344 --> 01:22.578
Oh, I'll kill her.

01:22.645 --> 01:24.079
I'm gonna kill her!

01:24.147 --> 01:25.080
Myka.
What?

01:25.148 --> 01:26.348
I get the whole anger thing,

01:26.416 --> 01:27.683
but could you please
just channel it

01:27.750 --> 01:28.951
into finding us
a way outta here?

01:29.018 --> 01:30.285
Okay, okay.

01:30.353 --> 01:32.087
Our Warehouse, right,
there's a back door

01:32.155 --> 01:34.389
in our Warehouse, so there
must be one here too.

01:34.457 --> 01:35.891
Bingo!
Right.

01:39.362 --> 01:40.596
Pete, look, a hatch!
What?

01:40.663 --> 01:42.631
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:42.699 --> 01:44.333
Myka, you found a hatch.
Yeah!

01:44.400 --> 01:45.267
A hatch!
Whoo!

01:45.335 --> 01:47.002
100 feet up there,

01:47.070 --> 01:48.403
so not as good, but--

01:48.471 --> 01:49.605
well, it wouldn't
be up there

01:49.672 --> 01:50.806
if there wasn't a way
to get to it.

01:50.874 --> 01:52.040
Right.
Right?

01:52.108 --> 01:55.377
So let's look for something,
you know.

01:55.445 --> 01:57.079
Egyptian endless wonder.

01:57.146 --> 01:57.980
Right.
Get it.

01:58.047 --> 01:59.581
Yeah!

01:59.649 --> 02:01.850
Okay, just keep searching
the shelves, okay?

02:01.918 --> 02:04.253
There's gotta be--
there.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.723
I don't know, like,
a magic ladder,

02:07.790 --> 02:09.491
or--or a catapult

02:09.559 --> 02:11.260
or something.

02:11.327 --> 02:12.494
And go.

02:12.562 --> 02:14.997
It's probably just
a rug, Pete!

02:15.064 --> 02:16.832
And move, and fly.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.967
Oh, my God.

02:19.035 --> 02:22.037
Pete, I'm looking at the ten
original books of Plato.

02:22.105 --> 02:23.605
Is there a chapter
on flying?

02:23.673 --> 02:25.040
Not that I remember.

02:25.108 --> 02:27.309
Oh, oh, oh.
What about--

02:27.377 --> 02:29.077
what about a snake
around a staff?

02:29.145 --> 02:30.979
Isn't that a medical symbol?

02:31.047 --> 02:34.082
Uh, that's probably
the rod of Asclepius.

02:34.150 --> 02:36.885
It's probably some sort
of healing device.

02:36.953 --> 02:39.021
Yes, we can definitely
use this.

02:39.088 --> 02:40.355
Ah.

02:40.423 --> 02:42.057
Or not.
Pardon me, sir.

02:43.993 --> 02:45.994
Pete!
Pete, over here!

02:48.231 --> 02:49.598
Whoa.
Right?

02:49.666 --> 02:51.400
Okay, these wings were probably
designed by Daedalus.

02:51.467 --> 02:52.701
He was the father of--
Icarus.

02:52.769 --> 02:53.802
Ha, even I know that one.

02:53.870 --> 02:55.437
Turn around.
What, why me?

02:55.505 --> 02:56.972
You're the one
that eats like a bird.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.142
Well, just don't get us
too close to the sun, okay?

03:00.209 --> 03:02.110
They smell.

03:08.785 --> 03:09.718
Oh.

03:09.786 --> 03:11.987
Whoa.

03:12.055 --> 03:14.790
These things actually
attract wind.

03:14.857 --> 03:17.225
Yeah, they generate
their own lift.

03:17.293 --> 03:19.127
Holy crap!

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.438 --> 03:29.771
Whoa.

03:29.839 --> 03:32.074
Can you imagine watching
a Browns game like this?

03:32.141 --> 03:34.576
Yeah, I bet that's exactly
what Daedalus had in mind.

03:34.644 --> 03:36.745
Up. Pete, up.

03:36.813 --> 03:38.447
Ah, the hatch!
Yeah.

03:38.514 --> 03:41.216
All right, get it,
get it, get it, get it.

03:41.284 --> 03:42.451
Okay, stop, stop.
You ready?

03:42.518 --> 03:44.686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44.754 --> 03:48.857
Go!

03:48.925 --> 03:50.158
It's stuck.

03:50.226 --> 03:52.594
Well, yank it.
Yank it hard.

03:53.796 --> 03:55.397
Really?
At a time like this?

03:55.465 --> 03:58.033
I'm sorry.

03:58.101 --> 03:59.234
Oh, what?
Come on!

04:00.770 --> 04:02.604
Pete, do you hear that?
That's the Farnsworth.

04:02.672 --> 04:04.006
It must be working again.

04:04.073 --> 04:05.707
We must be high enough.
Back pocket.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.409
What? Okay.
Yeah.

04:07.477 --> 04:09.478
Ooh.

04:09.545 --> 04:11.179
Stop laughing!

04:11.247 --> 04:12.914
Okay, okay.
Okay.

04:12.982 --> 04:15.017
Okay.

04:15.084 --> 04:16.418
Artie.
Hi.

04:16.486 --> 04:18.487
Myka, listen,
H.G. Is a bad guy.

04:18.553 --> 04:19.721
We know!

04:19.789 --> 04:21.255
Pete, good,
you're together.

04:21.324 --> 04:23.692
Yeah, we always kind of
thought we'd go out this way.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.094
Look, Artie,
Valda's dead.

04:26.162 --> 04:27.863
Warehouse 2
is filling with sand.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.431
Artie, listen,
I'm really sorry.

04:29.499 --> 04:31.867
Tell Kelly that I love her.
Tell her to--

04:31.934 --> 04:33.201
shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:33.269 --> 04:34.803
Close your eyes.

04:34.871 --> 04:36.571
Close your eyes?

04:36.639 --> 04:38.707
That's the last thing
he's gonna say to us?

04:38.775 --> 04:41.176
I always thought it would be
a little more, you know,

04:41.244 --> 04:42.477
meaningful.

04:42.545 --> 04:44.212
He didn't even say good-bye.
I know.

04:46.349 --> 04:47.282
Oh.

04:47.350 --> 04:50.318
Oh, Myka, hold on, hold on.

04:50.386 --> 04:52.421
Pete, close your eyes!

04:55.258 --> 04:57.025
I can't see.

04:57.093 --> 04:59.895
Okay.

04:59.962 --> 05:01.997
The wings of Daedalus.
Good call.

05:02.065 --> 05:03.632
Don't just flap there.

05:03.699 --> 05:04.699
Come on out.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.535
Here we come.
Hold on.

05:20.783 --> 05:23.985
Whoo.

05:24.053 --> 05:26.088
Whoo, man, you have got
to let me keep these.

05:26.155 --> 05:28.590
Oh, right, because they worked
out so well for Icarus.

05:28.658 --> 05:30.826
Artie, who are you,
Jerusalem Jones?

05:31.961 --> 05:34.162
What?
I just bought this.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.164
So how'd you find us?

05:36.232 --> 05:38.667
I pinpointed the coordinates
on your Farnsworth.

05:38.734 --> 05:40.602
Good thing it started
working again.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.003
Yeah, they're designed
to work deep underground,

05:42.071 --> 05:43.238
but when I lost the signal

05:43.306 --> 05:44.873
I realized that H.G.
Had jammed it.

05:44.941 --> 05:46.108
I knew you were in trouble.

05:46.175 --> 05:47.275
When I got here,
I reset the frequency.

05:47.343 --> 05:48.443
It was a piece of cake.

05:52.648 --> 05:54.950
Finally, listen,
H.G.'S a bad guy.

05:55.017 --> 05:56.551
We know!

06:02.725 --> 06:04.259
Judging from the depth
of her preparation,

06:04.327 --> 06:06.828
it seems obvious to me
that H.G. Wells

06:06.896 --> 06:09.331
has been planning this
for a long--

06:09.398 --> 06:11.299
and I mean a long--time.

06:11.367 --> 06:12.834
She hacked into
the Warehouse account

06:12.902 --> 06:14.269
to fund those students.

06:14.337 --> 06:16.037
Yes, and she discovered,
somehow, the location

06:16.105 --> 06:19.074
of Warehouse 2
even before she was bronzed.

06:19.142 --> 06:20.475
Did MacPherson
know that somehow?

06:20.543 --> 06:21.977
Yeah, but she needed
experienced agents

06:22.044 --> 06:23.278
to get in there.

06:23.346 --> 06:24.346
Well, she obviously
wanted an artifact,

06:24.413 --> 06:25.614
but which one?

06:25.681 --> 06:26.848
The place is filled
with sand, Artie.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.250
It's gonna take months
to dig out.

06:28.317 --> 06:31.186
Artie, is there--
is there some kind of inventory

06:31.254 --> 06:32.320
of Warehouse 2?

06:32.388 --> 06:33.855
Yes.

06:33.923 --> 06:35.657
For a time, I had
a cognitive connection

06:35.725 --> 06:37.125
to Warehouse 2.

06:37.193 --> 06:39.427
Much of its inventory was
downloaded into my mind.

06:39.495 --> 06:42.297
Hell of a backup drive.
Can you access it?

06:42.365 --> 06:44.666
I can try.
It's fading.

06:44.734 --> 06:46.134
Tell me quickly
what you remember

06:46.202 --> 06:47.669
of H.G.'S last position.

06:47.737 --> 06:49.538
Well, Myka and I
were in the office

06:49.605 --> 06:51.206
trying to figure out
where the key went, right?

06:51.274 --> 06:54.276
And then H.G. ran to see if
she could turn off the orb.

06:54.343 --> 06:55.544
She went to the main floor.

06:55.611 --> 06:56.945
Can you describe the area

06:57.013 --> 06:58.280
in which she was
ultimately found?

06:58.347 --> 06:59.848
There was--
there was vases.

06:59.916 --> 07:03.084
There was lots
of clay pots and vases.

07:03.152 --> 07:04.186
How can she spot
what's missing?

07:04.253 --> 07:05.787
She's just that good?

07:05.855 --> 07:07.189
Yes.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.657
Now I assume
that Warehouse 2

07:08.724 --> 07:11.593
has an inventory system
like ours.

07:11.661 --> 07:14.429
Each item is labeled
with a hieroglyph of Anubis.

07:14.497 --> 07:17.199
If Anubis is sitting, then
the item is in its proper place.

07:17.266 --> 07:20.135
If Anubis is running...

07:20.203 --> 07:22.003
Ah.

07:22.071 --> 07:23.371
Rack of Spears.
One is missing.

07:23.439 --> 07:24.873
Rack of Spears.

07:24.941 --> 07:26.575
Missing spear,
labeled in any way?

07:26.642 --> 07:28.577
Yes.

07:28.644 --> 07:30.745
Fading.

07:30.813 --> 07:34.316
I can't tell you.
The image is gone.

07:34.383 --> 07:35.684
Okay, no.

07:35.751 --> 07:38.320
Artie, this is progress,
right?

07:38.387 --> 07:39.721
We don't know
where she is, but--

07:39.789 --> 07:41.022
Paris.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.557
I'm still tracking
H.G.'S access to funds.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.792
She just bought a ticket
from Cairo to de Gaulle.

07:43.859 --> 07:45.493
Why Paris?

07:45.561 --> 07:46.828
When Pete and Myka
were in 1961,

07:46.896 --> 07:48.597
H.G. told me her daughter
was murdered in Paris.

07:48.664 --> 07:50.665
Okay, so she's returning
to the scene of the crime.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.033
Or that's where
Christina is buried.

07:52.101 --> 07:54.603
Maybe the spear
has resurrection properties.

07:54.670 --> 07:55.971
She wants to bring her
daughter back from the dead?

07:56.038 --> 07:57.572
I don't know about Spears,
but I can tell you

07:57.640 --> 07:59.174
resurrection is
a dangerous practice

07:59.242 --> 08:00.175
and always comes
at a price.

08:00.243 --> 08:01.643
Yeah, look at
Mickey Rourke.

08:01.711 --> 08:03.745
So--

08:03.813 --> 08:06.748
all right, Pete, Myka,
you go to Paris.

08:06.816 --> 08:08.416
Claudia,
you try to find out

08:08.484 --> 08:09.985
exactly where
Christina's buried.

08:10.052 --> 08:11.853
I will do research
on Spears.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.623
Mrs. Frederic, you--

08:14.690 --> 08:16.992
will just be Mrs. Frederic.

08:18.327 --> 08:20.428
Hey, it's Kelly.
You mind?

08:20.496 --> 08:22.697
Sure, Pete,
we've got nothing but time.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.868
Kelly, hey.
I was just gonna call you.

08:26.936 --> 08:28.603
What happened to you?

08:28.671 --> 08:30.772
Two days ago we had
a vague conversation

08:30.840 --> 08:32.841
about moving in together,
and then--

08:32.908 --> 08:34.009
then you disappear.

08:34.076 --> 08:35.176
Ugh, Kelly, I'm--

08:35.244 --> 08:37.279
look, I'm so sorry.

08:37.346 --> 08:39.780
You know, you must think I'm
the biggest jerk in the world.

08:39.849 --> 08:42.049
Well, I went between that

08:42.118 --> 08:44.219
and wondering if I should
be calling hospitals.

08:44.287 --> 08:45.387
No, no, no, no.

08:45.454 --> 08:47.255
I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:47.323 --> 08:49.758
It's a long story.
I had a sudden business trip.

08:49.825 --> 08:50.792
Pete!

08:50.860 --> 08:51.993
Look, um, Kelly,

08:52.061 --> 08:53.628
we got a lot
to talk about.

08:53.696 --> 08:56.531
Pete, you know, if you don't
want to see me anymore, it's--

08:56.599 --> 08:58.099
no, no, Kelly, look, I--

08:58.167 --> 09:00.135
I love seeing you.

09:00.202 --> 09:02.070
Okay, you're my happiest
place on earth.

09:05.141 --> 09:06.608
You mean that?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.243
I know it in my soul.

09:08.311 --> 09:10.245
Okay, I just--I've got
this one more trip,

09:10.313 --> 09:12.881
and then I'm
yours completely.

09:12.948 --> 09:14.716
The minute you get back.

09:14.784 --> 09:16.918
The second I get back.

09:16.986 --> 09:20.088
And, Kelly...

09:20.156 --> 09:21.222
I love you.

09:37.139 --> 09:38.573
Okay, I said it.

09:38.641 --> 09:40.208
Yes, I even said it first.

09:40.276 --> 09:43.845
So go ahead, make fun.

09:46.182 --> 09:49.784
I'm really glad
you found someone, Pete.

09:49.852 --> 09:51.786
You deserve it.

09:51.854 --> 09:54.923
Okay, now I really
feel like a girl.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.358
Well, hike up your skirt,

09:56.425 --> 09:57.759
'cause we got
a bad guy to catch.

09:57.827 --> 09:59.160
Boo-yah!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:40.318 --> 10:41.519
Hang back there,
Pointer Sister.

10:41.586 --> 10:42.920
Sorry, sorry.

10:42.988 --> 10:45.122
I thought, you know,
handling some ancient Spears

10:45.190 --> 10:48.325
would trigger a notion, but--

10:48.393 --> 10:49.627
okay, well, I'm sorry
to interrupt you

10:49.694 --> 10:51.962
while you're handling
your ancient spear,

10:52.030 --> 10:53.531
but I found
Christina's gravesite.

10:53.598 --> 10:55.466
Good.
You let Pete and Myka know?

10:55.534 --> 10:56.600
Texted them.

10:56.668 --> 10:57.735
They land at de Gaulle
any minute.

10:57.802 --> 10:58.736
All right.

11:00.138 --> 11:04.175
Um, Artie, can I talk to you
about something?

11:04.242 --> 11:06.877
Will it make me feel old
and uncomfortable?

11:06.945 --> 11:08.646
Not this time.

11:08.713 --> 11:10.481
All right, go on.

11:10.549 --> 11:12.483
Okay, when Dr. Vanessa

11:12.551 --> 11:14.318
was here trying to save
Mrs. Frederic,

11:14.386 --> 11:17.254
she, um...

11:17.322 --> 11:20.758
She said something
that kinda scared me.

11:20.825 --> 11:23.627
When it looked like
Mrs. F. might not make it,

11:23.695 --> 11:27.164
she said that I should
be ready.

11:27.232 --> 11:30.834
And you want to know,
ready for what, Hmm?

11:30.902 --> 11:32.636
Actually no.

11:32.704 --> 11:35.873
Uh, I'm--I'm pretty sure
I'm not ready.

11:35.941 --> 11:38.542
I know that I might
talk big sometimes, Artie,

11:38.610 --> 11:40.311
but I can't even buy
a wine cooler in this state,

11:40.378 --> 11:41.979
so whatever you might
have planned for me--

11:42.047 --> 11:44.281
breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.283
You can do whatever you want.

11:46.351 --> 11:48.686
You control
your own destiny.

11:48.753 --> 11:49.787
But she said--

11:49.854 --> 11:50.754
no, nothing
has been decided

11:50.822 --> 11:52.656
or will be decided

11:52.724 --> 11:55.226
without your complete consent.

11:55.293 --> 11:56.660
You promise?

11:56.728 --> 11:57.861
With all my heart.

11:57.929 --> 12:00.598
You will live the life
that you want,

12:00.665 --> 12:01.865
and I'll make sure of that.

12:01.933 --> 12:03.801
Oh, thank you.

12:18.216 --> 12:20.150
<i>Voila, monsieur.</i>

12:20.218 --> 12:21.719
According to Claudia,
the <i>Cimetiere du Rennes</i>

12:21.786 --> 12:23.754
should be right around
this corner.

12:23.822 --> 12:25.256
H.G.'s probably
already here.

12:25.323 --> 12:27.157
Good, first time,
shame on her.

12:27.225 --> 12:29.326
Second time,
I'm bringing that bitch down.

12:29.394 --> 12:30.761
I love it
when you talk dirty.

12:30.829 --> 12:33.597
What?

12:33.665 --> 12:34.898
Where's the cemetery?

12:34.966 --> 12:38.869
It has to be here.
This is the address.

12:38.937 --> 12:41.071
Excuse me.
Hi, uh, excuse me.

12:41.139 --> 12:44.008
Uh, do you speak English?

12:44.075 --> 12:47.511
We're looking for
"the cemetery du Ron."

12:47.579 --> 12:49.546
<i>Cimetiere du Rennes</i> moved

12:49.614 --> 12:51.282
many years ago.

12:51.349 --> 12:52.850
To where?

12:52.917 --> 12:55.419
Bah.

12:55.487 --> 12:57.121
Ew.

12:57.188 --> 12:59.490
What now?

12:59.557 --> 13:01.825
Okay, look, if H.G.'s plan

13:01.893 --> 13:03.827
was to resurrect her daughter,

13:03.895 --> 13:06.130
then she needed to arrange
for the upkeep

13:06.197 --> 13:08.365
of her remains, right?

13:08.433 --> 13:10.367
Which means there's an estate.

13:10.435 --> 13:12.436
And estates have lawyers.

13:12.504 --> 13:14.271
French lawyer.
Bah!

13:14.339 --> 13:17.341
Bah.

13:17.409 --> 13:20.511
Mr. Sempe, thank you for
taking this walk with me.

13:20.578 --> 13:22.646
If you want to visit
Christina Wells' resting place,

13:22.714 --> 13:23.781
I can give you the address.

13:23.848 --> 13:24.882
You don't need me.

13:24.949 --> 13:26.383
Oh, but I do.

13:26.451 --> 13:28.986
I don't want to go all around
Paris shooting people.

13:29.054 --> 13:31.955
As my lawyer,
you can give me full access.

13:32.023 --> 13:33.924
Full access?
I don't understand.

13:33.992 --> 13:36.327
You don't have
to understand.

13:36.394 --> 13:38.729
You just need to sign
whatever needs to be signed.

13:38.797 --> 13:40.497
Then what?

13:40.565 --> 13:43.133
And then maybe
I'll let you live.

13:49.641 --> 13:52.576
You check the girl.
I'll look for the lawyer.

14:00.919 --> 14:02.019
It's empty.
He's gone.

14:02.087 --> 14:03.287
She's in shock.

14:03.355 --> 14:04.755
Look, if H.G. shot her
with the same gun

14:04.823 --> 14:06.056
that she used on us...

14:06.124 --> 14:10.794
Then she's come
and gone already.

14:10.862 --> 14:12.730
Pete.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.167
Look.

14:34.953 --> 14:36.487
I'm grateful
she's been taken care of

14:36.554 --> 14:37.955
to my specifications.

14:38.022 --> 14:39.623
I signed the papers.

14:39.691 --> 14:41.892
You can do
whatever you want in here.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.461
May I leave now?

14:44.529 --> 14:47.564
In a moment.

14:47.632 --> 14:49.133
Don't be rude.

14:55.373 --> 14:58.075
Remove your shoes
and step into this, please.

15:05.850 --> 15:07.785
Madame, please,
I'm just a simple lawyer.

15:07.852 --> 15:09.553
Not even a very good one.

15:09.621 --> 15:11.755
Now would be nice.

15:18.329 --> 15:20.931
What is it?

15:20.999 --> 15:24.568
Primordial tar from
Pitch Lake in Trinidad.

15:24.636 --> 15:26.603
Don't really have time
to explain what it does.

15:29.574 --> 15:31.909
You wouldn't
believe me anyway.

15:37.182 --> 15:39.183
I'm stuck.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.884
You have no idea.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.389
Help me!
Help me!

15:47.125 --> 15:48.559
Help me.

15:48.626 --> 15:49.526
No!

15:52.096 --> 15:55.265
If you put water in it,
it turns it into a tar pit.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.401
Don't fight it, dude.

15:57.469 --> 15:59.436
That's what
the Woolly Mammoths did.

16:04.576 --> 16:06.777
Pete, H.G.,
she ran down there.

16:06.845 --> 16:07.811
Oh, <i>mon dieu.</i>

16:11.449 --> 16:12.850
What in the hell was that?

16:12.917 --> 16:14.117
Monsieur Sempe,
you mind waiting outside?

16:14.185 --> 16:15.986
Happily.

16:16.054 --> 16:18.055
This place is a labyrinth.

16:18.122 --> 16:19.423
She's gone.

16:19.491 --> 16:20.557
Pete, would you mind--

16:20.625 --> 16:21.992
what?

16:22.060 --> 16:26.663
You know, looking to see
if Christina...

16:26.731 --> 16:27.731
Ew.

16:27.799 --> 16:29.233
Yep, she's dead.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.934
Still really dead.

16:31.002 --> 16:34.071
Okay.

16:34.138 --> 16:36.940
Pete.
Yeah?

16:37.008 --> 16:39.843
H.G. didn't even
have the spear with her.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.411
Yeah, but we don't even
know how it works.

16:41.479 --> 16:43.514
No, no, something--

16:43.581 --> 16:46.083
something is wrong.

16:46.150 --> 16:48.185
She took something,
something that's missing.

16:48.253 --> 16:50.387
The handle.

16:50.455 --> 16:52.089
Are you sure
there was a handle?

16:52.156 --> 16:55.459
Yes, and then the other
one's right there.

16:55.527 --> 16:56.994
Show me.

16:57.061 --> 16:59.329
Okay, if you can't see it,
the ends have points,

16:59.397 --> 17:01.198
like--like arrows.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.433
I've seen
that shape before.

17:03.501 --> 17:04.800
Where?

17:04.868 --> 17:06.203
I don't know what it is,

17:06.271 --> 17:07.637
but I can't get it
out of my head.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.106
Look.

17:09.173 --> 17:11.208
MacPherson must have
left an image of it

17:11.276 --> 17:13.076
inadvertently via the pearl.

17:13.144 --> 17:14.211
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

17:14.279 --> 17:16.146
Let's look at that shape

17:16.214 --> 17:19.650
from different angles.

17:19.717 --> 17:23.720
Now what did Myka say,
that the tips have points or--

17:23.788 --> 17:24.855
like arrows.

17:24.923 --> 17:26.522
Like arrows, all right.

17:26.590 --> 17:28.559
Like arrows.

17:32.363 --> 17:34.364
Now...

17:34.432 --> 17:37.701
Does this suggest an--

17:41.172 --> 17:43.473
Mrs. Frederic,
do you see--

17:43.541 --> 17:46.276
see what?

17:46.344 --> 17:50.147
It's not a spear.

17:50.214 --> 17:51.381
It's...

17:51.449 --> 17:52.916
The Minoan Trident.

17:52.984 --> 17:56.453
So a bad thing?

17:56.521 --> 17:58.121
What's the Minoan Trident?

17:58.189 --> 18:00.691
A weapon
of mass destruction.

18:00.758 --> 18:04.161
The first weapon
of mass destruction.

18:08.179 --> 18:09.379
Okay, okay, wait.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.715
The Minoan Trident
was the first

18:11.782 --> 18:14.784
weapon of mass destruction?

18:14.852 --> 18:17.053
The trident was the first
artifact locked away

18:17.121 --> 18:19.456
by Alexander the Great
in what became Warehouse 1.

18:19.524 --> 18:22.192
In the 15th Century B.C.E.,

18:22.260 --> 18:24.327
the Minoan civilization
was destroyed

18:24.395 --> 18:27.297
by a catastrophic
volcanic eruption.

18:27.365 --> 18:28.365
Oh, I know this one.

18:28.432 --> 18:29.933
It's the Thera Volcano,

18:30.001 --> 18:32.435
which created the island
of Santorini.

18:32.503 --> 18:34.070
The Thera eruption was
thought to have been caused

18:34.138 --> 18:36.840
by a trident, which when
jammed into the ground

18:36.908 --> 18:40.043
three times causes a fissure
in the earth's surface.

18:40.111 --> 18:41.711
If done in the right place,

18:41.779 --> 18:43.580
it could unleash
a volcanic eruption.

18:43.648 --> 18:46.383
Is that what Plato based
the story of Atlantis on?

18:46.450 --> 18:48.818
Right, right.
Poseidon had a trident.

18:48.886 --> 18:50.120
I played him
in the fifth grade

18:50.187 --> 18:51.288
with a pitchfork
and a toga.

18:51.355 --> 18:52.856
At out Ralph Brunskie
for that part.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.225
Kid had a voice
like Jennifer Tilly.

18:55.293 --> 18:57.093
I am Poseidon.

18:57.161 --> 18:58.528
I'm--I'm terribly sorry.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.497
Que sera.

19:00.565 --> 19:02.599
Peter...

19:02.667 --> 19:04.434
The trident is real.

19:04.502 --> 19:06.469
That's one of the reasons
the Romans came to Egypt.

19:06.537 --> 19:08.038
Caesar wanted that power.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.174
That explains why
the trident is in two pieces.

19:11.242 --> 19:14.311
H.G. found part of it
in the 1800s

19:14.378 --> 19:16.212
and hid it
on her daughter's casket.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.715
And MacPherson
debronzed her

19:18.783 --> 19:20.684
so he could find Warehouse 2

19:20.751 --> 19:22.085
and the other half
of the trident.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.620
That's why she killed him.

19:23.688 --> 19:24.888
He was about to tell us.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.657
Yeah, the question is:

19:27.725 --> 19:29.526
Now that she's got
both parts,

19:29.594 --> 19:31.728
what is she planning
to do with them?

19:33.764 --> 19:35.832
Someone evil
just bought a plane ticket.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.567
To?

19:37.635 --> 19:40.036
Casper/Natrona
International, Wyoming.

19:40.104 --> 19:41.905
That's only two hours
away from here.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.873
All right,
get back here right now.

19:45.676 --> 19:47.677
MacPherson was
collecting artifacts

19:47.745 --> 19:49.779
to sell them
to the highest bidder.

19:49.847 --> 19:51.181
Do we think that H.G.
is doing the same thing?

19:51.248 --> 19:52.882
Let's hope so.

19:52.950 --> 19:56.519
The alternative
could be unpleasant.

19:58.122 --> 20:00.290
Good, boy.
You did great, Harvey.

20:00.358 --> 20:01.725
There's a lot less
to lick now,

20:01.792 --> 20:03.460
but I promise you
it'll make your life

20:03.527 --> 20:05.562
a whole lot easier.

20:22.279 --> 20:25.281
When I saw this,
I thought of you.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.652
Oh, Pete.

20:33.991 --> 20:35.925
Gorgeous.

20:35.993 --> 20:37.727
Oh.

20:37.795 --> 20:40.230
Look, Harvey.

20:40.297 --> 20:42.332
He even engraved it
with our favorite breed.

20:44.935 --> 20:47.637
Let's send him a picture
of us using it.

20:50.608 --> 20:53.343
It looks like things
are okay between me and Kelly.

20:53.411 --> 20:55.412
Why would you say that?

20:55.479 --> 20:58.448
She sent me some pictures...

20:58.516 --> 21:00.116
With her and a little puppy.

21:00.184 --> 21:02.085
Look, she's powdering
his nose.

21:02.153 --> 21:04.554
Look at the little puppy.

21:04.622 --> 21:07.557
Okay, it's official.
I'm a girl.

21:07.625 --> 21:10.360
You had a lot of vibes
about H.G., didn't you?

21:13.164 --> 21:16.866
No, not really.

21:16.934 --> 21:18.768
God, you're a terrible liar.

21:18.836 --> 21:21.137
What?

21:21.205 --> 21:23.540
Look, I trust
your instincts, Mykes.

21:23.607 --> 21:25.508
We're partners, a team.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.177
Yeah, well, I put
the team in danger

21:27.244 --> 21:30.814
because I thought I knew
better than everybody else.

21:30.881 --> 21:32.382
Look, you need
to forget about that.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.451
Okay, there's no way that any
of us could be sure that--

21:34.518 --> 21:37.587
no, there was plenty of doubt
from everyone but me.

21:37.655 --> 21:41.024
H.G. has
a huge advantage, Myka.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.493
She's willing to lie,
steal, and kill

21:43.561 --> 21:45.495
to get what she wants,
and we're not.

21:45.563 --> 21:47.564
So I'm gonna side
with us on this one.

21:47.631 --> 21:49.899
With you.

21:51.035 --> 21:51.968
Lattimer.

21:52.036 --> 21:53.236
Oh, good, you've landed.

21:53.304 --> 21:54.437
I do hate voicemail.

21:54.505 --> 21:56.339
Oh, hey, Lady Koo-Koo.

21:56.407 --> 22:00.009
We were just
talking about you.

22:00.077 --> 22:02.178
Well, what, are you calling

22:02.246 --> 22:03.980
to play a little game
of let's make a deal?

22:04.048 --> 22:05.682
Oh, I'm afraid not,
dear boy.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.383
Oh, come on.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.286
Nutjob like you must have
quite a wish list.

22:10.354 --> 22:13.089
How 'bout a little
electroshock therapy,

22:13.157 --> 22:14.290
zap the crazy
right out of you?

22:14.358 --> 22:15.892
Run a trace
on Pete's phone.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.494
Already happening.
We put a trace on both

22:17.561 --> 22:19.028
your phones as soon as
you got to Paris just in case.

22:19.096 --> 22:20.230
Once I lock in
on her signal,

22:20.297 --> 22:21.631
I can track her with this.

22:21.699 --> 22:22.699
With what?
What is that?

22:22.767 --> 22:23.867
Show me--
are you messing around

22:23.934 --> 22:25.001
with stuff
in the Farnsworth aisle?

22:25.069 --> 22:26.536
I've been quite impressed,

22:26.604 --> 22:28.071
keeping up with me
as you have.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.140
Not quite catching me
of course,

22:30.207 --> 22:32.041
but then I am me.

22:32.109 --> 22:33.610
Well, go ahead,
get nice and comfy.

22:33.677 --> 22:35.278
Oh, don't worry.

22:35.346 --> 22:37.580
I've closed all my accounts
and buried my trail.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.616
So now are you just
calling to brag

22:39.683 --> 22:42.185
or did you get a sudden
craving to be bronzed again?

22:42.253 --> 22:43.820
'Cause we can make that
happen for you.

22:43.888 --> 22:45.355
For such
a mediocre kisser,

22:45.422 --> 22:47.357
I'd have thought you'd
at least have brains.

22:47.424 --> 22:49.759
Yeah, well, you taste
about as old as you are,

22:49.827 --> 22:51.528
so right back at you there,
grandma.

22:51.595 --> 22:52.896
Now what do you want?

22:52.963 --> 22:54.764
Just to suggest
that you check in on Kelly

22:54.832 --> 22:57.367
about now.

22:57.434 --> 22:58.501
Pete, don't--

22:58.569 --> 23:00.336
listen, you leave her
the hell alone.

23:00.404 --> 23:02.138
She has nothing
to do with this.

23:02.206 --> 23:04.340
Oh, I haven't
done a thing.

23:04.408 --> 23:07.443
But you, you sent her
a lovely gift.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.512
I'm sure
she'll be crazy for it.

23:12.316 --> 23:14.350
We have to get to Kelly.

23:14.418 --> 23:16.219
No, no, no, no, she's just
trying to distract us.

23:16.287 --> 23:18.488
Artie, I can't stay here,
I gotta go.

23:18.556 --> 23:20.190
All right,
just watch your back.

23:20.257 --> 23:21.357
Got her.
Where is she?

23:21.425 --> 23:23.226
Wyoming, and not far, but--
what?

23:23.294 --> 23:24.594
She's not stationary.
She's moving.

23:24.662 --> 23:26.362
Looks like I-26,
heading for Bryson Reservoir.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.031
Bryson, Bryson Reservoir.

23:29.934 --> 23:32.535
Bryson, Bryson, it's in
the middle of nowhere.

23:32.603 --> 23:34.604
I mean, it's not even
a tourist stop on the way to--

23:36.440 --> 23:38.875
Yellowstone.

23:38.943 --> 23:41.144
She's on a road trip
to see America?

23:41.212 --> 23:42.512
She can't be.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.913
You don't think that--

23:43.981 --> 23:45.348
you don't think what?
She can't be what?

23:45.416 --> 23:46.449
The Yellowstone caldera.

23:46.517 --> 23:47.550
Artie.

23:47.618 --> 23:49.285
I've got a map here.

23:49.353 --> 23:50.720
Not this, this.

23:50.788 --> 23:52.655
A seismic hazard map

23:52.723 --> 23:55.425
of the six known
supervolcanoes in the world,

23:55.492 --> 23:56.793
and the most powerful of which
is thought to be

23:56.861 --> 23:58.494
Yellowstone caldera,
which is under--

23:58.562 --> 24:01.064
well, it's under Wyoming,
Idaho, and Montana.

24:01.131 --> 24:02.599
Are you kidding me?
People go there for vacation.

24:02.666 --> 24:05.702
If H.G. were to jam the
trident into the ground there--

24:05.769 --> 24:06.936
it would cause
a chain reaction

24:07.004 --> 24:08.438
of monstrous proportions.

24:08.505 --> 24:09.739
Millions would die
immediately,

24:09.807 --> 24:11.040
but there's
a far greater problem.

24:11.108 --> 24:12.342
Bigger than
millions would die?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.110
The last supervolcano
that erupted

24:14.178 --> 24:16.145
was 75,000 years ago.

24:16.213 --> 24:18.314
Triggered an ice age.

24:18.382 --> 24:22.185
Only 6,000 humans survived.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.320
Claudia, go back up Pete.

24:24.388 --> 24:26.422
You and I are going
to Yellowstone.

24:26.490 --> 24:27.757
She's taking a car.
We'll take a chopper.

24:27.825 --> 24:28.791
We'll get there ahead of her.
Go, go, go.

24:28.859 --> 24:30.059
Right, hey.

24:30.127 --> 24:31.361
You know,
this is kinda cool.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.162
Good luck.
Yeah.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.164
Can we get there in time?

24:35.232 --> 24:36.799
We have to.

24:39.387 --> 24:40.954
Kelly, are you here?

24:42.207 --> 24:44.074
Kelly?

24:46.578 --> 24:48.111
Kelly?

24:58.823 --> 25:00.557
I've been waiting for you.

25:03.228 --> 25:05.095
Oh, my God.

25:05.163 --> 25:07.164
You scared me to death.
I thought--

25:11.035 --> 25:12.402
hey, no, ha, hey!

25:12.470 --> 25:14.838
Kelly, wait a minute!
Just hold on!

25:14.906 --> 25:16.874
Just--just cut it out!

25:16.941 --> 25:18.909
That is exactly
what I intend to do,

25:18.977 --> 25:23.046
cut it out.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.818
Gotta be an artifact.

25:27.886 --> 25:31.255
Even I can't make women
this angry.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.723
Just stand still.

25:32.790 --> 25:34.625
Listen, Kelly,
somebody did something to you,

25:34.692 --> 25:35.926
and I don't know what,

25:35.994 --> 25:38.128
but just, please,
you gotta trust me.

25:38.196 --> 25:39.997
I love you, Pete.

25:40.064 --> 25:41.665
Oh, babe.

25:41.733 --> 25:43.467
Babe, I love you too.

25:43.535 --> 25:46.169
And that's why
I have to kill you.

25:48.439 --> 25:49.573
Really?

25:49.641 --> 25:51.441
Really? No!

25:54.846 --> 25:58.148
Give me that.

25:58.216 --> 25:59.850
Pete.

25:59.918 --> 26:01.718
What are you doing?

26:01.786 --> 26:03.854
Kelly, are you back?

26:03.922 --> 26:05.522
What's going on?

26:05.590 --> 26:06.924
Let go of me!

26:06.991 --> 26:08.592
It must be the knife.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.527
What, she gave you
Lorena Bobbitt's knife?

26:10.595 --> 26:12.362
I'm so thirsty.

26:12.430 --> 26:14.097
Okay, come on, baby.

26:14.165 --> 26:15.265
Come on, come on.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.467
God, I need some water.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.570
Are you okay?
No, get me some water.

26:19.637 --> 26:21.371
All right, hold on,
I'll be right back.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.215
Ow.

26:32.283 --> 26:34.117
Oh, God.

26:34.185 --> 26:37.821
Are you putting me down?

26:37.889 --> 26:40.090
Now we'll do this
the easy way.

26:43.027 --> 26:45.262
Artie, something's fishy.
Pete, won't answer his phone.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.397
Don't worry,
Claudia has his back.

26:51.302 --> 26:53.503
She's gotta be
right around here.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.872
The magma chamber
is highest here.

26:55.940 --> 26:57.908
Right here?
Yeah.

26:57.976 --> 27:00.010
Okay.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.912
What's that for?

27:01.980 --> 27:03.680
This is a subterranean
heat sensor.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.515
Reaches thousands of feet
into the ground and--

27:05.583 --> 27:08.285
okay, wow, the temperature
is astronomical here.

27:08.353 --> 27:11.021
If she's coming,
she's coming here.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.824
And here she is.

27:13.891 --> 27:15.425
I'm not surprised
you found me.

27:15.493 --> 27:17.027
But I'm quite baffled
that you expect

27:17.095 --> 27:18.295
to do anything about it.

27:18.363 --> 27:20.030
And what could
you possibly want

27:20.098 --> 27:21.798
that you would go
to these lengths?

27:21.866 --> 27:23.266
What, money?
Power?

27:23.334 --> 27:24.267
What?

27:24.335 --> 27:25.402
Nothing!

27:25.470 --> 27:26.403
Nothing?

27:26.471 --> 27:28.472
What do you mean nothing?

27:28.539 --> 27:30.140
You obviously know
what you're holding.

27:30.208 --> 27:31.675
This isn't
a bargaining tool.

27:31.743 --> 27:33.644
I intend to use it

27:33.711 --> 27:35.545
right here, right now.

27:43.721 --> 27:44.788
Hiya, Kelly.

27:44.856 --> 27:47.524
What's up?

27:47.592 --> 27:49.826
Claudia, you can't
be here right now.

27:49.894 --> 27:51.294
I have work to do.

27:54.999 --> 27:57.501
Uh, Kelly, hey, hey.
Hold on a second.

27:57.568 --> 27:58.769
What are you doing there?

27:58.836 --> 28:00.237
Chopping Pete up
into little bits.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.339
Uh-huh, right.
And why?

28:02.407 --> 28:03.774
Because I love him.

28:03.841 --> 28:05.842
And that's a beautiful
way to show it, but, um--

28:05.910 --> 28:07.044
Claudia, if you don't
get out of my way,

28:07.111 --> 28:08.378
I'm going to have
to kill you.

28:08.446 --> 28:09.980
I'd really rather
you just give me the ax.

28:10.048 --> 28:11.214
All right then.

28:15.420 --> 28:16.553
There's got to be
something here.

28:16.621 --> 28:17.587
Did somebody
send you that ax?

28:17.655 --> 28:18.989
Let go of me!

28:19.057 --> 28:20.490
What's newere, Kel?

28:20.558 --> 28:23.060
Compact!

28:23.127 --> 28:25.629
Hello, antique-y.
Where'd you come from?

28:25.697 --> 28:26.797
Pete sent it to me.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.233
Hang on a sec, Pete.

28:30.301 --> 28:31.902
Kinda got
my hands full here.

28:31.969 --> 28:33.170
L--L.A.B.

28:33.237 --> 28:34.438
Laboratory? No.

28:34.505 --> 28:35.772
Ah!
Initials.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.607
Okay, Lonny? Lindsay?

28:37.675 --> 28:39.042
Larry? Lizzie?

28:39.110 --> 28:41.111
Lizzie.
Lizzie Borden! Woot!

28:41.179 --> 28:44.514
Lizzie Borden took an ax
and gave her father 40 whacks.

28:44.582 --> 28:46.450
And when the job
was neatly done,

28:46.517 --> 28:48.351
she gave her mother 41.

28:55.293 --> 28:56.660
My God.

28:56.728 --> 28:59.663
What's going on?

28:59.731 --> 29:01.331
And why is Pete
tied to my table?

29:03.801 --> 29:06.336
Claudia, what's happening?

29:06.404 --> 29:07.738
It's okay.

29:07.805 --> 29:09.239
Somebody,
I can't tell you who,

29:09.307 --> 29:12.275
gave you Lizzie Borden's
compact.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.944
Lizzie Andrew Borden.

29:14.011 --> 29:15.746
I did a term paper on her.

29:15.813 --> 29:18.381
Apparently you name
your daughter Andrew,

29:18.449 --> 29:20.984
and she chops you
into little bits.

29:21.052 --> 29:22.686
Big surprise.

29:22.754 --> 29:25.288
I tried to kill Pete.

29:25.356 --> 29:27.858
No, it's--it's okay.

29:27.925 --> 29:29.793
Why would I do that?

29:29.861 --> 29:32.596
Well, looking into
the compact

29:32.663 --> 29:34.564
probably makes you kill
the thing you love.

29:34.632 --> 29:36.867
So maybe Lizzie
did it after all.

29:36.934 --> 29:39.436
What are you talking about?

29:39.504 --> 29:41.104
No, no, baby, baby.

29:41.172 --> 29:43.840
Baby, this is good, okay?

29:43.908 --> 29:45.442
This means that you love me.

29:45.510 --> 29:46.576
Stop.

29:46.644 --> 29:48.812
See, 'cause the truth is--

29:48.880 --> 29:51.481
stop!

29:51.549 --> 29:53.750
I tried to kill you.

29:57.255 --> 29:58.321
Wait, Kelly.

29:58.389 --> 30:00.524
Hey, Kelly, Kelly,
it's all right.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.926
Just give it a rest
for a bit.

30:02.994 --> 30:04.628
Give her head
time to catch up.

30:08.099 --> 30:10.600
Wait, I don't understand.

30:10.668 --> 30:13.637
Why would you kill millions
of innocent people?

30:13.704 --> 30:14.971
Innocent?

30:15.039 --> 30:16.540
Open your eyes, Myka.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.176
Have you looked at the world
in which you live?

30:19.243 --> 30:22.012
So because you lost your
daughter, because you're angry--

30:22.079 --> 30:23.346
no, don't you dare.

30:23.414 --> 30:24.781
This may have begun
with Christina's murder,

30:24.849 --> 30:25.849
but it's not about that.

30:25.917 --> 30:27.584
Yeah, I foolishly believed

30:27.652 --> 30:29.419
that if I could find a way
to travel through time

30:29.487 --> 30:30.854
then things would have
improved,

30:30.922 --> 30:32.489
a utopia would have emerged,

30:32.557 --> 30:34.658
but here we are
over a century later

30:34.725 --> 30:37.427
and things have actually
gotten worse.

30:37.495 --> 30:39.529
The divide between
rich and poor,

30:39.597 --> 30:42.566
hunger and famine,
war and violence and hatred,

30:42.633 --> 30:44.534
all flourishing
beyond control.

30:44.602 --> 30:47.537
Indeed men have found
new ways to kill each other

30:47.605 --> 30:49.272
that were inconceivable
in my day

30:49.340 --> 30:50.473
even by fiction writers.

30:50.541 --> 30:51.775
But millions of us
are struggling

30:51.843 --> 30:53.844
against that every day.

30:53.911 --> 30:57.480
This planet needs a rest
from what you've done to it.

30:57.548 --> 31:00.383
It needs a chance
to repair itself.

31:00.451 --> 31:03.353
Oh, my God,
you seriously intend

31:03.421 --> 31:05.288
to start another Ice Age.

31:08.059 --> 31:09.492
The only way
to save this world

31:09.560 --> 31:11.995
is by destroying the parasites
who are eating it alive.

31:12.063 --> 31:13.330
I don't normally do this.

31:17.902 --> 31:19.236
And you're gonna
wish you hadn't.

31:19.303 --> 31:20.904
Artie?
Oh?

31:20.972 --> 31:22.839
Artie, what is it?

31:27.311 --> 31:28.245
Artie, what is it?

31:28.312 --> 31:29.846
The Corsican Vest?

31:29.914 --> 31:32.382
I'm afraid so.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.818
Artie, what's--
what's happening?

31:34.886 --> 31:37.420
Well, the vest,

31:37.488 --> 31:39.623
it belonged
to the Corsican Brothers.

31:39.690 --> 31:40.857
Twins.

31:40.925 --> 31:42.392
When one of them got hurt,

31:42.460 --> 31:44.461
the other felt it.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.129
You did that to yourself.

31:46.197 --> 31:48.431
Where did you find it,
Venice?

31:48.499 --> 31:49.699
Fort lauderdale.

31:49.767 --> 31:52.102
Oh, of course.

31:52.169 --> 31:53.603
Ahh!

32:04.184 --> 32:05.351
Myka!

32:05.911 --> 32:07.045
Three times.

32:07.107 --> 32:10.009
Don't let her do it
three times.

32:10.076 --> 32:12.178
I won't.

32:12.245 --> 32:14.680
Hey!

32:14.748 --> 32:16.348
I wouldn't.

32:16.416 --> 32:18.617
Myka, talk to her.
Talk to her.

32:20.587 --> 32:23.322
So what,

32:23.390 --> 32:25.791
the entire planet is subject
to your judgment now?

32:25.859 --> 32:27.393
What about
the millions of mothers

32:27.460 --> 32:28.527
who are gonna lose
their daughters

32:28.595 --> 32:30.696
just like you u lost Christina?

32:30.764 --> 32:32.231
Is that right?

32:32.299 --> 32:35.534
This is no world
for a child.

32:35.602 --> 32:36.769
I don't think
you believe that.

32:36.836 --> 32:38.237
I do.

32:38.305 --> 32:39.638
Watch me.

32:39.706 --> 32:41.273
No!

32:46.947 --> 32:48.280
Myka, that's two.

32:56.356 --> 33:00.159
You are lying to yourself.

33:00.227 --> 33:01.660
You never wanted this.

33:01.728 --> 33:03.596
If you wanted to kill
Pete and me,

33:03.663 --> 33:05.364
you would have done it
at Warehouse 2

33:05.432 --> 33:06.899
or in Paris.

33:06.967 --> 33:08.667
And Artie, you would
have let him die in Russia,

33:08.735 --> 33:10.502
but you didn't.

33:10.570 --> 33:12.137
I needed you to trust me.

33:12.205 --> 33:15.107
No, you needed us
to stop you.

33:15.175 --> 33:17.576
You wanted us to follow you
and stop you.

33:17.644 --> 33:19.645
That's why you called
Pete this morning.

33:19.713 --> 33:23.048
Think, Helena.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.150
You are so filled
with grief and anger,

33:25.218 --> 33:27.920
but there is a part of you,
I know it,

33:27.988 --> 33:31.290
there is some small part
of your soul

33:31.358 --> 33:33.459
that knows that this is wrong,

33:33.526 --> 33:35.594
and--and that part
is still alive,

33:35.662 --> 33:40.199
and it's just pushing
to get through.

33:40.267 --> 33:42.868
Yes.

33:42.936 --> 33:44.937
That's the part
that refuses to kill

33:45.005 --> 33:46.538
the very people
who can stop you.

33:46.606 --> 33:47.706
No!

33:47.774 --> 33:49.675
Stay away from me.

33:51.511 --> 33:53.412
All right.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.482
If I am wrong,
then kill me.

33:56.549 --> 33:57.950
Do it!

33:58.018 --> 33:59.285
Kill me now.

33:59.352 --> 34:00.919
I mean, we're all
gonna die anyway, right?

34:00.987 --> 34:03.022
So what's the difference?

34:03.089 --> 34:04.556
So shoot me.

34:04.624 --> 34:05.891
Shoot me now.

34:08.094 --> 34:09.661
Kill me.

34:09.728 --> 34:13.132
But not like that.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.467
Not like a coward.

34:16.536 --> 34:18.370
I want you to look me
in the eyes

34:18.438 --> 34:21.507
and take my life.

34:21.574 --> 34:24.510
Come on.

34:24.577 --> 34:26.210
Do it.

34:26.279 --> 34:27.880
Do it!

34:53.039 --> 34:55.206
So if you're not gonna

34:55.275 --> 34:57.843
put H.G. Wells
back in the bronze sector,

34:57.911 --> 34:59.311
where's she gonna go,

34:59.379 --> 35:02.181
some other weird place
that we don't know about?

35:02.248 --> 35:03.949
The less you know,

35:04.017 --> 35:07.086
the better you'll be able
to do your job.

35:07.153 --> 35:10.289
That doesn't sound good.

35:10.357 --> 35:12.958
You both did excellent work
retrieving that artifact

35:13.026 --> 35:16.295
and preventing
a worldwide disaster.

35:16.363 --> 35:18.497
That, of course,
is the prime directive

35:18.565 --> 35:20.566
of Warehouse agents.

35:20.633 --> 35:24.303
H.G. Wells
was a formidable opponent.

35:24.371 --> 35:26.472
She fooled us all.

35:26.539 --> 35:28.140
She didn't fool Artie.

35:45.492 --> 35:49.561
Fortunately, I'm still
a lousy shot with a real gun.

35:51.431 --> 35:53.065
Are you gonna die on us
every year?

35:53.133 --> 35:54.333
'Cause it's getting
kinda boring.

35:54.401 --> 35:56.235
I'm gonna keep dying
until it takes,

35:56.302 --> 35:57.269
or not.

35:57.337 --> 35:58.604
Ah, it hurts when I shrug.

35:58.671 --> 36:00.272
Yeah, well, I bet
wagging your finger

36:00.340 --> 36:02.374
at me, old man, will be--

36:06.780 --> 36:09.348
hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, kiddo.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.283
Hey.

36:11.351 --> 36:15.354
I plan on making your life
hell for a very long time.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.957
Can I hug you?
Maybe later in the week.

36:19.025 --> 36:21.593
Okay.

36:31.704 --> 36:33.305
Hey.

36:33.373 --> 36:35.040
What are you, uh,
putting together

36:35.108 --> 36:38.143
some stuff for a shelter?

36:38.211 --> 36:41.146
I'm leaving.

36:41.214 --> 36:43.715
Okay, okay, look.

36:43.783 --> 36:45.117
I'm sorry.

36:45.185 --> 36:46.685
I've been really
busy at work,

36:46.753 --> 36:49.321
but I found some bones
in the garbage today

36:49.389 --> 36:52.357
and they're very--

36:56.095 --> 36:58.964
I know, I know, I know.

36:59.032 --> 37:01.834
I--I've been wanting
to tell you, but...

37:01.901 --> 37:05.804
Okay, I don't really work
at an I.R.S. Warehouse.

37:05.872 --> 37:07.973
No kidding.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.142
All right, just--
just listen, okay?

37:10.210 --> 37:12.611
The rule is
I can tell one person,

37:12.679 --> 37:14.213
one really
important person, so--

37:14.280 --> 37:16.248
no, don't.

37:18.151 --> 37:20.853
I am not the one, Pete.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.089
So please don't tell me.

37:24.157 --> 37:26.458
I don't want
a complicated life.

37:26.526 --> 37:27.926
Complic--

37:27.994 --> 37:29.528
it's not that complicated.

37:29.596 --> 37:32.464
Kelly, it's way more simple
than it looks.

37:32.532 --> 37:33.966
Okay, Lizzie borden's compact

37:34.033 --> 37:35.234
makes you kill
the one you love,

37:35.301 --> 37:37.102
like she killed her dad.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.470
You love me,
and I love you.

37:38.538 --> 37:39.705
It's simple.

37:39.772 --> 37:41.507
It's just that your life

37:41.574 --> 37:43.408
is filled with excitement,

37:43.476 --> 37:46.678
and danger,

37:46.746 --> 37:48.280
and just insanity,

37:48.348 --> 37:52.518
and it's--it's all the things
that I don't want.

37:54.487 --> 37:58.056
There are quiet days too.

38:10.136 --> 38:11.436
Good-bye, Pete.

38:13.206 --> 38:14.873
Stay safe.

38:39.872 --> 38:41.073
Hey.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.407
What's up?

38:47.213 --> 38:51.049
I've been, um...
Trying to figure out ways

38:51.117 --> 38:53.452
to simplify my life,

38:53.519 --> 38:58.623
and it all boils down
to three words.

38:58.691 --> 38:59.891
"Quit your job, Pete."

39:02.395 --> 39:03.628
Four words.
Mm-hmm.

39:03.696 --> 39:05.030
I wasn't counting "pete."

39:15.007 --> 39:18.510
So then what?

39:18.578 --> 39:20.946
I don't know,
get Kelly back.

39:21.013 --> 39:24.649
I don't know, try and live
a normal life.

39:26.018 --> 39:27.285
What?

39:30.623 --> 39:32.057
If you had wanted
to do that,

39:32.125 --> 39:34.493
you would have already left.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.195
Look, just because
that worked on H.G. Doesn't--

39:37.263 --> 39:41.299
this--this is
the right life for you.

39:41.367 --> 39:45.036
It is.

39:45.104 --> 39:47.305
You were born for it.

39:47.373 --> 39:52.177
And you're really, really,
really good at it.

39:52.245 --> 39:54.179
You are.

39:54.247 --> 39:56.615
You need this Warehouse,

39:56.682 --> 39:59.384
and this--

39:59.452 --> 40:03.221
Warehouse 13 needs you.

40:03.289 --> 40:06.091
You can't quit.

40:06.159 --> 40:08.059
Yeah.

40:08.127 --> 40:10.495
Yeah.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.400
All right,
I'm gonna go see Artie.

40:15.468 --> 40:17.435
You coming?

40:17.503 --> 40:20.772
Um, Pete, I--

40:20.840 --> 40:22.707
in a bit.

40:22.775 --> 40:24.643
Okay.
Okay.

40:30.616 --> 40:32.584
I understand
you wanted to see me.

40:32.652 --> 40:36.121
Yeah. Yes.

40:36.189 --> 40:37.923
Would you--

40:37.990 --> 40:40.826
would you give this
to Artie, please?

40:44.063 --> 40:46.498
Myka.

40:46.566 --> 40:48.433
You can't blame yourself.

40:48.501 --> 40:50.335
It could have happened
to any one of us.

40:50.403 --> 40:51.970
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

40:52.038 --> 40:55.106
You talked her down.

40:55.174 --> 40:56.541
You saved us all.

40:56.609 --> 40:58.376
It should never
have come to that.

40:58.444 --> 41:02.380
I put the entire world
in Jeopardy.

41:02.448 --> 41:06.885
I can't even conceive
of that.

41:06.953 --> 41:10.789
I just know that I can't--

41:10.857 --> 41:12.958
I can't take
that chance again.

41:13.025 --> 41:16.461
And neither can you.

41:19.632 --> 41:27.405
âª âª

41:29.675 --> 41:33.378
"Artie, it breaks my heart
to write this.

41:33.446 --> 41:37.415
"We both know the Warehouse
is my happiest place.

41:37.483 --> 41:39.184
"I've thought a lot
about this,

41:39.252 --> 41:41.119
"and I can't stay here.

41:41.187 --> 41:42.988
"If I do,
I'll second-guess myself

41:43.055 --> 41:44.289
"into oblivion.

41:44.357 --> 41:46.992
"Please forgive me,
but I have to go.

41:47.059 --> 41:51.529
âª âª

41:51.597 --> 41:54.032
"Pete, you're the Big Brother
I never had.

41:54.100 --> 41:58.837
"I wish I had your strength.

41:58.905 --> 42:00.872
"I know I frown at you
and punch you a lot,

42:00.940 --> 42:02.641
"but I'll always love you.

42:02.708 --> 42:03.708
"Please be careful.

42:06.812 --> 42:10.315
"Leena, you're
the only mom they have.

42:10.383 --> 42:13.184
"Watch over them,

42:13.252 --> 42:16.721
"and make sure that Artie
eats right.

42:16.789 --> 42:21.259
"Claudia, take care
of Pete and Artie.
