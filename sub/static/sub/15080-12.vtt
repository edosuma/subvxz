39:36.044 --> 39:38.126
AND I WILL RECOMMEND
YOU GET A SUSPENDED SENTENCE.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.471
CAN'T SLEEP?

39:52.471 --> 39:56.394
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THE WEDDING'S SO SOON.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.977
HOW WAS THE TASTING,
BY THE WAY?

39:58.977 --> 40:04.362
EH, NOT NEARLY AS EXCITING
AS YOURS, APPARENTLY.

40:04.362 --> 40:08.617
I GOT TO ADMIT, UM...
TOFU WAS KIND OF INTERESTING.

40:08.617 --> 40:10.909
REALLY?
MM.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.410
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.834
IT WAS...SOFT.

40:15.834 --> 40:18.837
IT WAS SMOOTH.

40:18.837 --> 40:22.541
YOU THINKING ABOUT MIXING UP
YOUR DIET, ARE YOU?

40:22.541 --> 40:24.042
[ CHUCKLES ]

40:24.042 --> 40:28.216
I'M PRETTY HAPPY
WITH WHAT'S ON THE REGULAR MENU.

40:28.216 --> 40:29.888
Daniel:
EACH OF US THINKS THAT

40:29.888 --> 40:32.511
WE'RE AT THE CENTER
OF OUR OWN LITTLE UNIVERSE.

40:32.511 --> 40:36.685
BUT THE CONSCIOUS MIND
IS -- IS LIKE

40:36.685 --> 40:39.317
A PLANET ON THE EDGE
OF A DISTANT GALAXY,

40:39.317 --> 40:42.651
FAR AWAY FROM WHERE
ALL THE COOL STUFF IS HAPPENING.

40:42.651 --> 40:45.904
JUST AS STARS ARE PULLED
BY THE GRAVITY OF OBJECTS

40:45.904 --> 40:47.325
YET TO BE DISCOVERED,

40:47.325 --> 40:48.867
SO ARE WE INFLUENCED BY

40:48.867 --> 40:51.119
UNCONSCIOUS FEELINGS
AND DESIRES

40:51.119 --> 40:54.452
THAT DRIFT JUST BEYOND
OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE THEM.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.576
NOW, OCCASIONALLY,
IN OUR DREAMS,

40:57.576 --> 40:59.918
WE ACT ON THESE IMPULSES...

40:59.918 --> 41:03.291
WHICH IS PROBABLY SAFER THAN
DOING IT IN THE REAL WORLD...

41:03.291 --> 41:08.466
BUT WHEN POWERFUL DESIRES
DO ENTER OUR ORBIT,

41:08.466 --> 41:10.679
COULD BE TOUGH TO IGNORE THEM.

41:13.261 --> 41:16.184
THE QUESTION IS, SHOULD WE
ALWAYS FORCE THESE PRIMAL URGES

41:16.184 --> 41:18.557
BACK INTO THE DARKNESS
FROM WHENCE THEY CAME?

41:20.519 --> 41:23.151
OR IS IT SOMETIMES...

41:24.903 --> 41:27.485
...OKAY TO BE BAD?
