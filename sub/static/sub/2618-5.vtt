00:19.546 --> 00:20.630
Help !

00:33.481 --> 00:34.829
Hotel landscaper found him.

00:34.978 --> 00:36.227
Almost hit him
with his weed wacker.

00:36.284 --> 00:38.100
He hasn't been here long, Frank.

00:38.548 --> 00:40.648
I've got uniforms
canvassing for other witnesses.

00:40.705 --> 00:42.727
Hello. Hi.
Are you in charge here ?

00:43.572 --> 00:45.027
As a matter of fact, I am.

00:45.124 --> 00:46.593
Could the patrol
cars park in the back ?

00:46.593 --> 00:48.353
I don't want to upset the guests.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.970
Oh, yeah, we'll jump right on that.

00:50.226 --> 00:50.765
Who are you ?

00:50.995 --> 00:52.720
Craig Seabourn,
manager of the hotel.

00:52.777 --> 00:54.581
So, Seabourn, do you know this man ?

00:55.094 --> 00:56.584
Armando Diaz.

00:56.613 --> 00:57.991
He's an employee here,

00:58.018 --> 00:58.970
takes care of the pool.

00:58.997 --> 01:00.531
And someone took care of him.

01:00.916 --> 01:01.702
Not here.

01:01.767 --> 01:02.399
I agree.

01:02.512 --> 01:05.025
I think he was killed
somewhere else and dumped here.

01:05.861 --> 01:06.487
Told you.

01:06.528 --> 01:08.935
No way is my place involved in this.

01:09.428 --> 01:10.709
We're a five-star hotel.

01:10.769 --> 01:11.953
How do you explain this ?

01:12.870 --> 01:15.213
- Where did you find that ?
- I found it on his body.

01:15.847 --> 01:17.395
It's the key
to the penthouse suite.

01:17.437 --> 01:19.638
Or as we call it,
the primary crime scene.

01:19.721 --> 01:24.307
Mr. Seabourn, you are about
to lose your five-star status.

01:31.557 --> 01:34.730
CSI: Miami - Season 4
Episode 5 - Three-Way

02:12.793 --> 02:14.434
Welcome to Hotel Graciana.

02:14.618 --> 02:15.214
Thank you.

02:15.368 --> 02:16.389
Hope you enjoy your visit.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.883
Can we have a quote ?

02:19.933 --> 02:21.479
I just want one comment.

02:21.573 --> 02:22.504
Could you move to your left ?

02:22.572 --> 02:23.907
No, no, camera left.

02:23.957 --> 02:24.900
Just one comment.

02:24.968 --> 02:26.757
I'm going to ask you
one more time,

02:26.870 --> 02:29.245
take that camera off my body.

02:29.739 --> 02:31.146
The dead deserve better.

02:33.663 --> 02:34.729
We're good to go.

02:35.437 --> 02:36.537
Then go.

02:43.059 --> 02:44.117
You still seeing her ?

02:44.152 --> 02:45.252
No. It's...

02:45.880 --> 02:47.390
She's very pretty, so I...

02:47.711 --> 02:49.336
Could we just focus
on the victim ?

02:50.137 --> 02:51.391
Confirmation,

02:51.580 --> 02:52.737
he wasn't killed here.

02:52.830 --> 02:54.700
Head wounds are the second
biggest bleeders

02:54.769 --> 02:57.228
next to arterial cuts,
and I don't see any blood.

02:57.507 --> 02:59.398
Body's been moved.
We're thinking Penthouse.

02:59.402 --> 03:01.151
Yeah. I heard that on the news.

03:01.637 --> 03:03.273
She didn't get it from me, okay ?

03:03.445 --> 03:04.421
Yeah, right.

03:05.198 --> 03:07.428
The victim really looks like
he's been through the ringer.

03:07.449 --> 03:08.100
Yeah.

03:08.859 --> 03:12.160
Worst of it, looks like
blunt force trauma to the head.

03:12.189 --> 03:13.534
I'll know more at the post.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.812
Lot of white fibers in his hair.

03:15.954 --> 03:16.791
Maybe cotton ?

03:18.421 --> 03:19.308
I don't know.

03:19.506 --> 03:20.920
I bagged some of it for you.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.480
H said he's a pool boy.

03:22.515 --> 03:23.835
Probably from towels.

03:23.888 --> 03:26.331
Question is, what's the pool boy
doing in the penthouse suite ?

03:26.474 --> 03:27.637
Yeah, let's head up there.

03:27.978 --> 03:29.749
I got paged at court,
I'm out a kit.

03:30.048 --> 03:31.274
All right the backup's
in the Hummer.

03:31.331 --> 03:31.785
Oh, great.

03:31.916 --> 03:32.982
We'll meet you in the lobby.

03:36.487 --> 03:37.651
- Horatio ?
- Yeah.

03:38.527 --> 03:40.530
Dispatch says
the Chief's looking for you.

03:41.808 --> 03:42.988
Did you say the Chief ?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.407
- He mention why ?
- I have no idea,

03:45.451 --> 03:46.473
but he wants to talk to you,

03:46.536 --> 03:47.988
says he'll send a car for you.

03:48.891 --> 03:50.482
I'll drive myself, Frank.

03:59.130 --> 04:00.812
A case you were working on
a few years ago--

04:00.854 --> 04:03.971
the guy's up for parole. I need you
to make a statement at his hearing.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.549
And you took me off
a crime scene for this, Chief ?

04:12.207 --> 04:14.091
There have been rumblings
about your team.

04:14.903 --> 04:16.685
Rumblings ?
How do you mean ?

04:18.408 --> 04:21.452
I need an honest assessment
of what these kids are up to.

04:22.069 --> 04:24.568
Our solve rate
is second to none.

04:24.983 --> 04:26.438
But one of your CSIs

04:26.810 --> 04:28.975
is an open leak to the media.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.676
One's got money trouble,

04:30.716 --> 04:32.724
one quit her job
that she was trained to do,

04:32.726 --> 04:33.769
and we're suffering for it.

04:33.792 --> 04:35.514
So, it sounds like
the brass is planning

04:35.577 --> 04:36.949
to make a surprise visit.

04:38.206 --> 04:39.889
Yeah, I heard it at breakfast.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.852
It could happen any time
in the next eight weeks.

04:41.852 --> 04:43.924
They're gonna be looking
at character and case-handling.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.330
Chief, I am...

04:46.126 --> 04:48.764
I am not concerned
about the character of my team.

04:49.185 --> 04:50.389
Given the, uh,

04:50.805 --> 04:52.213
character issues,

04:53.039 --> 04:55.985
you might want
to do a dry test on a case.

04:56.038 --> 04:58.325
Like maybe the dead
pool boy at the hotel.

04:58.457 --> 05:00.652
Let your team run
this one on their own.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.157
Shore up their protocols.

05:04.093 --> 05:06.400
Somebody's really gunning
for us, aren't they ?

05:07.222 --> 05:08.394
I don't know who.

05:08.631 --> 05:12.280
All I know is that they got to get the
kinks out before the brass sweeps in,

05:12.282 --> 05:13.569
does their own eval.

05:16.196 --> 05:17.249
We'll be ready.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.386
Who borrowed the backup kit last ?

05:34.498 --> 05:35.094
I did.

05:35.655 --> 05:37.890
There are no swabs,
evidence bags,

05:37.893 --> 05:39.060
and the maglight's dead.

05:39.259 --> 05:40.999
Forgot to restock it. Sorry.

05:41.811 --> 05:43.152
Gonna borrow some of yours.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.921
Actually, I need those.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.961
I know the feeling.

05:51.493 --> 05:54.026
Could you at least leave me
an extra pair of gloves ?

05:54.957 --> 05:57.187
Yes. Yours don't fit me anyway.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.249
We paid good money
for the penthouse.

06:01.504 --> 06:02.232
I'm sorry.

06:02.781 --> 06:04.661
Well, you can't keep
us out of our own room.

06:04.693 --> 06:06.182
Actually, I can.
It's a crime scene.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.232
What ?

06:08.718 --> 06:10.080
Any of you know, uh...

06:10.960 --> 06:11.884
know this guy,

06:12.102 --> 06:13.105
worked at the pool ?

06:13.713 --> 06:14.749
That's Armando.

06:15.127 --> 06:16.006
So, you know him ?

06:16.538 --> 06:17.928
He oiled me.

06:18.408 --> 06:19.499
I beg your pardon ?

06:19.597 --> 06:20.278
Tanning oil.

06:20.372 --> 06:22.520
The hotel has somebody
who applies it at the pool.

06:22.579 --> 06:23.794
He oiled all of us.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.038
Just relax.

06:30.483 --> 06:31.565
Just relax.

06:32.550 --> 06:33.339
Relax.

06:33.738 --> 06:34.394
Is that true ?

06:34.705 --> 06:35.423
Yeah.

06:35.856 --> 06:37.803
This must be some kind of mistake.

06:38.011 --> 06:38.685
There isn't.

06:38.801 --> 06:40.400
Armando's been murdered.

06:40.619 --> 06:41.960
I was wondering if any of you ladies

06:41.991 --> 06:43.732
could tell me how he got a key
to your room ?

06:43.902 --> 06:44.345
What ?

06:44.780 --> 06:45.569
No.

06:46.469 --> 06:47.720
Maybe he robbed us.

06:49.378 --> 06:49.964
Maybe.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.318
Will you excuse us
for a second, please ?

07:00.245 --> 07:02.365
I counted three wedding bands,

07:02.365 --> 07:05.007
but there don't seem
to be any husbands.

07:05.052 --> 07:07.002
They're calling it "Wives' Weekend."

07:07.039 --> 07:08.724
Sun, spa, but no sex.

07:10.265 --> 07:11.223
We'll see about that.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.680
Yeah, I knew that, Eric,

07:13.680 --> 07:15.134
'cause, actually, I worked
that case, too, so...

07:15.205 --> 07:15.835
Good.

07:16.384 --> 07:17.342
Got some blood.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.029
Looks like this is
where our vic bought it.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.466
Or had a drink.
That could be a Bloody Mary.

07:21.937 --> 07:23.702
Well, Phenolphthalein
will confirm that.

07:24.117 --> 07:25.663
Even if it's blood,
once it's dry,

07:25.676 --> 07:27.075
there's no way to tell
how recent it is.

07:27.075 --> 07:28.196
The blood could be six weeks old.

07:28.196 --> 07:29.523
Yeah, or six hours.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.207
It's blood.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.447
Something happened here.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.149
Well, confrontations usually start

07:38.196 --> 07:39.700
in the bedroom or the bathroom.

07:40.325 --> 07:41.504
I'll take the bathroom.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.399
I'll take one of the bedrooms.

07:46.376 --> 07:47.871
I guess I'll start in here then.

08:05.872 --> 08:06.746
Need some help ?

08:07.477 --> 08:09.419
I think I've got it.
Thanks.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.956
There's cast-off
on the ceiling with no

08:12.956 --> 08:14.907
accompanying blood pool on the floor.

08:15.617 --> 08:17.585
So, somebody cleaned the floor,
and forgot the ceiling.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.865
People only clean what's in their
line of sight, eyes to knees.

08:20.983 --> 08:23.039
Let's see what the crime
light's gonna show.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.990
- Will you get the lights ?
- Yup.

08:33.744 --> 08:35.251
Looks like a pint's worth of blood.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.349
I wonder who cleaned it.

08:44.744 --> 08:45.902
I know how they did it.

08:46.429 --> 08:47.755
All the towels are gone.

08:48.882 --> 08:50.652
"How" is the first step to "who."

08:54.698 --> 08:55.541
Excuse me.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.448
I'm with Miami-Dade P.D.

08:57.519 --> 08:59.816
No Q-tips,
no laundry bags.

08:59.865 --> 09:02.005
That's all right. I just need
to look in your cart.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.067
Oh, si, si.

09:17.741 --> 09:18.506
Dios mio.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.103
Te juro, que no se
dedonde vino esa sangre.

09:30.459 --> 09:32.045
Esta bien, te creo.

09:33.766 --> 09:34.502
Blood and hair--

09:34.928 --> 09:36.440
looks like I got a twofer.

09:44.134 --> 09:45.454
Redecorating your bathroom ?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.079
I'm trying to confirm one is
a murder scene, and I'm betting

09:48.081 --> 09:49.405
that's my vic's blood on the end.

09:52.131 --> 09:54.197
My ThermoCycler will let you know.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.054
Great.

09:58.289 --> 09:59.980
And you know I'm good for the rest.

10:01.092 --> 10:02.555
Pleasure doing business with you.

10:11.495 --> 10:12.027
Hey,

10:12.347 --> 10:13.722
have you got anything on the hair ?

10:13.920 --> 10:14.627
Take a look.

10:16.469 --> 10:18.077
Looks like the shaft is split.

10:18.093 --> 10:20.022
Yeah, and it's flat in diameter.

10:20.431 --> 10:21.793
And it's curly at the root.

10:22.378 --> 10:23.150
African hair.

10:23.854 --> 10:24.397
Yup.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.749
I think we have a suspect.

10:32.993 --> 10:34.453
Is this about that pool guy ?

10:34.707 --> 10:37.676
We found your hair on
the towel bar that killed him.

10:40.092 --> 10:42.337
Well, it probably got there
when I hung up a towel.

10:42.948 --> 10:43.759
I don't think so.

10:44.139 --> 10:45.752
The way it was wound,
it's unlikely that

10:45.791 --> 10:47.824
it got trapped there
from casual transfer.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.634
How do you know it's mine ?

10:50.297 --> 10:52.032
Well, I could take your DNA.

10:52.964 --> 10:54.635
Unless there's something
you want to tell me.

10:57.788 --> 10:58.624
Okay.

10:59.728 --> 11:02.256
I went back to the room
to take a shower.

11:02.349 --> 11:04.373
I guess Armando followed me.

11:11.081 --> 11:12.840
You left this in your cabana.

11:16.251 --> 11:17.765
And then what happened ?

11:18.732 --> 11:20.454
I'd rather not get into it.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.311
I understand this is
incredibly difficult,

11:23.346 --> 11:24.636
but a man is dead.

11:27.492 --> 11:29.167
He was so gorgeous.

11:29.902 --> 11:32.021
Showing up at my door.

11:32.056 --> 11:34.889
Things like that don't happen
to me back in Pensacola.

11:42.127 --> 11:45.312
So you broke the wives' weekend rule.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.367
Not exactly.

11:48.102 --> 11:50.667
Well, ma'am, either
you did or you didn't.

12:08.785 --> 12:11.033
Okay, so...

12:11.720 --> 12:15.074
the pool boy's cabana wouldn't go up.

12:15.409 --> 12:18.169
It's one thing when it
happens with my husband,

12:18.929 --> 12:20.125
but come on,

12:20.160 --> 12:23.052
this guy was 24 years old,
and he couldn't perform ?

12:24.742 --> 12:26.422
I was embarrassed.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.882
He had to go take his little blue pills.

12:36.324 --> 12:38.109
Don't make that face.

12:38.144 --> 12:41.370
It's not me. It's you.

12:42.149 --> 12:44.215
Go to hell.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.061
I had to protect myself.

12:53.795 --> 12:55.822
So you're saying that
it was self-defense.

12:55.857 --> 12:57.066
It was.

12:58.121 --> 13:00.320
One hit is self-defense.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.928
Two more is murder.

13:05.111 --> 13:07.147
This is called cast-off.

13:07.182 --> 13:10.660
It proves that you took two
additional, very bloody swings.

13:29.153 --> 13:31.138
I guess I just lost it.

13:32.975 --> 13:33.848
Well...

13:35.799 --> 13:37.846
Then that's what you write.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.801
Excuse me.

13:45.559 --> 13:46.960
Hey.

13:47.307 --> 13:48.253
Hey.

13:48.388 --> 13:50.789
You got a pretty
satisfied look on your face.

13:50.824 --> 13:53.402
Beth Jacobson is writing
her confession as we speak.

13:53.437 --> 13:54.536
Her confession ?

13:54.871 --> 13:57.436
Yeah. She killed Armando
Diaz with a towel rod.

13:57.471 --> 13:59.038
Not according to my evidence.

14:06.944 --> 14:08.146
I know the feeling.

14:10.923 --> 14:13.072
Could you at least
leave me a pair of gloves ?

14:13.107 --> 14:14.143
Sure.

14:14.178 --> 14:16.133
Yours are too big for me anyway.

14:16.886 --> 14:18.911
Dude, are those
rolling papers in there ?

14:20.088 --> 14:21.385
They're not mine.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.303
Someone must've borrowed my kit.

14:25.885 --> 14:27.280
At least they restocked it.

14:27.515 --> 14:30.924
Yeah, we really got to crack down on
the pot smoking kit thieves around here.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.467
I said, they're not mine.

14:35.215 --> 14:36.567
Relax, Delko.

14:37.275 --> 14:38.637
I believe you.

14:39.460 --> 14:42.076
I hate it when people jump
to conclusions, don't you ?

14:44.748 --> 14:47.846
No, Officer, I don't seem
to recall anything like that.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.730
Maybe I can get your statements.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.789
Sure, we'll give you anything you need.

14:53.824 --> 14:55.940
Do you know when
we'll be able to go inside ?

14:57.047 --> 14:58.155
No I don't.

15:03.188 --> 15:05.268
This must be some kind of mistake.

15:11.107 --> 15:12.643
Okay. I'll start in this room.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.408
Hang on. Need to clear a path.

15:14.443 --> 15:15.887
Path for what ? There's no body.

15:15.922 --> 15:16.979
Path to the other rooms.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.652
Evidence gets stuck to shoes.

15:18.687 --> 15:20.431
Just happened in a
case a couple weeks ago.

15:20.466 --> 15:22.475
Actually, I remember
that, Eric, because, um,

15:22.510 --> 15:23.596
I worked that case, too.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.616
Good.

15:27.203 --> 15:28.491
Got some blood here.

15:28.869 --> 15:30.742
Looks like this is where
our vic bought it.

15:30.777 --> 15:31.707
Or had a drink.

15:31.742 --> 15:32.896
Could be a...

15:32.897 --> 15:34.449
Phenolphthalein

15:36.447 --> 15:37.689
Bathroom...

15:37.724 --> 15:39.861
All right, I'll take
one of the bedrooms.

15:42.955 --> 15:44.693
I guess I'll start in here then.

16:07.221 --> 16:09.710
So somebody cleaned
the floor, forgot the ceiling.

16:09.745 --> 16:12.869
People only clean what's in
their line of sight, eyes to knees.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.832
Excuse me. You mind if I take
a few things from your cart ?

16:20.867 --> 16:21.588
Que ?

16:25.659 --> 16:27.672
- Oh, sí, sí.
- Okay, gracias.

16:28.365 --> 16:30.006
I ran out of supplies.

16:30.816 --> 16:31.817
Great. Thank you.

16:38.793 --> 16:40.094
It could be a trail.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.721
Maybe this will lead us
to the crime scene.

16:41.756 --> 16:42.721
Gracias.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.384
Frank, you got a flashlight ?

16:52.619 --> 16:53.881
Ah, yeah.

16:54.416 --> 16:55.651
Where's yours ?

16:55.686 --> 16:57.034
It's a long story.

16:58.187 --> 16:59.508
Looks like a, uh,

16:59.543 --> 17:01.368
Felicia Hardy was in this room.

17:01.403 --> 17:02.840
You know, the redhead.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.977
Yeah, nothing hinky
about Mrs. Hardy yet.

17:05.212 --> 17:06.790
Consistent with her statement.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.010
Married, sleeping alone.

17:11.012 --> 17:12.244
Or not.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.265
So much for their no sex rule.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.824
Is that a hotel laundry bag ?

17:18.858 --> 17:20.263
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.756
You're supposed to collect
evidence with that ?

17:23.367 --> 17:26.498
Procedures manual only requires
a single-use container.

17:26.532 --> 17:28.224
I forgot to restock my kit.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.608
All right.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.660
Looks like Felicia went for a triple.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.709
Found two more condoms.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.564
Found the cause of
the blunt force trauma.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.224
Doesn't make sense.

17:53.677 --> 17:55.824
Guy hits his head
hard enough to be fatal...

17:56.615 --> 17:57.952
where's the blood ?

17:57.987 --> 17:59.590
Calleigh found blood in the bathroom.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.586
Somebody cleaned it up.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.715
Okay, we need to talk to
Felicia Hardy. Where is she ?

18:02.750 --> 18:03.949
She's down in the lobby.

18:03.984 --> 18:06.115
We finished questioning her,
she said she had to go.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.450
Yeah, I bet she did.

18:12.056 --> 18:13.306
Hey, hang on a second.

18:13.341 --> 18:14.732
Put that down.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.048
Can I help you with something ?

18:17.083 --> 18:17.982
Yeah.

18:18.017 --> 18:19.270
Were these bags in your room ?

18:19.834 --> 18:20.924
Yeah. Why ?

18:20.959 --> 18:22.299
Gonna have to collect them.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.889
And you are ?

18:23.924 --> 18:25.552
I'm-I'm her husband.

18:25.587 --> 18:27.455
Thought they were
supposed to stay home.

18:27.490 --> 18:29.784
She called me to come pick her up.

18:29.819 --> 18:31.918
Why do they need to
see your bags, Felicia ?

18:31.953 --> 18:34.322
The pool boy broke into our suite, so...

18:35.773 --> 18:38.735
We're going to need to collect
elimination samples as well.

18:38.770 --> 18:40.094
For robbery ?

18:40.129 --> 18:41.605
No. For murder.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.046
Pool boy turned up dead.

18:43.181 --> 18:44.033
What ?

18:44.068 --> 18:46.944
It's okay. I'm sure
they just need fingerprints.

18:46.979 --> 18:49.112
Yeah, and DNA from you.

18:49.431 --> 18:51.079
DNA ? For what ?

18:51.414 --> 18:52.895
It's standard procedure.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.268
And like I said I'm going to need
to hang on to your luggage.

19:05.948 --> 19:07.156
...and I'll let you know.

19:07.191 --> 19:08.037
Great.

19:13.873 --> 19:15.889
you know I'm good for the rest.

19:15.924 --> 19:17.212
Okay.

19:17.247 --> 19:19.468
Pleasure doing business with you.

19:30.876 --> 19:32.029
Unbelievable.

19:32.064 --> 19:32.805
What ?

19:32.940 --> 19:33.812
Wolfe.

19:34.247 --> 19:35.512
Again ?

19:35.947 --> 19:38.667
You need to just go on
a room and beat each other up.

19:38.702 --> 19:42.299
Yeah, I just saw him hand a wad of cash
to that reporter girlfriend of his.

19:42.434 --> 19:43.490
For what ?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.649
For what ?
For more air time probably.

19:46.684 --> 19:48.561
The guy gets off being on TV.

19:48.696 --> 19:50.441
I haven't been here that long, but

19:50.476 --> 19:51.966
he seems like a good criminalist.

19:52.001 --> 19:53.272
Who cares if he likes the media ?

19:53.307 --> 19:54.864
The media can ruin a case.

19:54.899 --> 19:55.919
Really ?

19:55.954 --> 19:58.110
I heard she helped you guys out
on the Mala Noche thing.

20:02.628 --> 20:05.275
Elimination samples, call me
when the results are in, okay ?

20:05.310 --> 20:06.999
And don't forget to run it against...

20:07.034 --> 20:09.040
The condoms. Yes, I know.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.400
You know, you got some trust issues.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.500
You're right.

20:31.483 --> 20:33.582
All right, that's it.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.435
Looks like it's going to be just
you and me, Armando, baby.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.385
Apparently, CSIs have more
important things to do.

20:50.842 --> 20:51.779
Great.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.280
What ?

20:53.515 --> 20:58.412
Well, I think I found sodium sulfonate and
fluorescent dye on Felicia Hardy's suitcase.

21:00.046 --> 21:02.732
Blood's my thing, Eric.
You gonna have to translate.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.947
It's, uh, it's laundry detergent.

21:06.468 --> 21:08.086
It's not a huge lead
when you find it

21:08.089 --> 21:09.683
on a soccer mom's luggage.

21:10.404 --> 21:11.939
Where one door closes...

21:12.492 --> 21:14.856
Your victim's DNA
was inside the condoms,

21:14.884 --> 21:16.353
but the really great part ?

21:17.095 --> 21:19.928
The vaginal contribution on
the outside matches Felicia Hardy.

21:26.030 --> 21:28.863
The brochures say
the air's different in Miami.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.434
I didn't know what they meant
till I got here.

21:33.122 --> 21:33.971
Yeah, right.

21:34.422 --> 21:35.288
The air.

21:36.431 --> 21:37.817
Makes you cheat on your husband.

21:39.150 --> 21:40.190
I know.

21:41.835 --> 21:43.446
I can't believe I did it. I...

21:44.676 --> 21:46.356
I mean, I just feel sick.

21:47.576 --> 21:48.865
I love Steven.

21:50.082 --> 21:51.607
That's why I called him
to come get me.

21:52.565 --> 21:55.885
I just wanted to pretend
none of this ever happened.

21:56.509 --> 21:57.871
Well, what did happen ?

21:58.550 --> 21:59.671
Pool boy seduce you ?

22:01.136 --> 22:02.009
Not exactly.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.474
Kinda the other way around.

22:05.895 --> 22:07.757
Look, I didn't go looking for him.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.474
He just appeared in your bed.

22:09.549 --> 22:10.489
Basically.

22:11.235 --> 22:12.805
Look, I came back
from my massage,

22:12.813 --> 22:14.237
and he was in my hotel suite,

22:14.237 --> 22:15.927
holding some ice to his head.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.343
He told me he had
slipped by the pool.

22:27.243 --> 22:28.930
What was he doing
in your room ?

22:29.093 --> 22:30.734
Returning a book to Beth.

22:30.799 --> 22:31.997
Said the maid let him in.

22:32.327 --> 22:33.771
You notice if his head
was bleeding ?

22:34.812 --> 22:36.580
That's not what I noticed.

22:39.371 --> 22:41.874
I know when a man
is attracted to me and

22:42.236 --> 22:44.003
he was very attracted.

22:47.764 --> 22:48.538
My...

22:54.124 --> 22:56.876
I found some blood and hair on
the headboard. How'd it get there ?

22:58.230 --> 23:00.757
I think he must've hit his head. I...

23:01.022 --> 23:01.730
You don't know ?

23:01.975 --> 23:03.706
I couldn't really see him.
He was...

23:06.415 --> 23:07.857
he was behind me.

23:17.950 --> 23:19.671
You didn't notice
that he hit his head ?

23:20.238 --> 23:22.920
We were together
for almost two hours.

23:22.925 --> 23:24.197
So I just thought he was,

23:24.924 --> 23:26.300
you know, exhausted.

23:30.716 --> 23:31.440
Armando ?

23:32.213 --> 23:33.214
You okay ?

23:33.928 --> 23:35.553
I definitely didn't think
he was hurt.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.028
God, I feel so guilty.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.582
Guilty about what,

23:43.561 --> 23:45.123
cheating on your husband, or

23:45.682 --> 23:47.068
leaving a man to die ?

23:48.628 --> 23:49.787
I'm sorry.

24:00.808 --> 24:02.134
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:02.729 --> 24:04.582
You got a pretty satisfied
look on your face.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.472
Beth Jacobson is writing
her confession as we speak.

24:07.544 --> 24:09.049
- Her confession ?
- Yeah.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.277
She killed her Armando Diaz
with a towel rod.

24:11.345 --> 24:12.848
Not according to my evidence.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.579
What do you mean ?

24:13.586 --> 24:16.671
I collected three condoms
from Felicia Hardy's bedroom.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.528
DNA on the inside said
it's from our vic, Armando,

24:19.530 --> 24:21.972
and the DNA on the outside
said it's from Felicia.

24:23.434 --> 24:26.289
And you think that's what killed him--
excessive lovemaking ?

24:27.383 --> 24:28.429
Excessive.

24:29.210 --> 24:31.222
What about the blunt force trauma ?

24:31.283 --> 24:33.218
He cracked his head
on the headboard.

24:33.630 --> 24:35.842
See I disagree.
According to the spatter,

24:35.842 --> 24:39.678
Beth hit him three times,
one free, two cast-off.

24:39.705 --> 24:41.353
She killed him with a towel rod.

24:43.903 --> 24:44.966
No, it was Felicia.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.437
The guy conked out
right next to her,

24:46.448 --> 24:49.797
she failed to call 911 and
then decided to skip town.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.041
It's negligent homicide.

24:51.097 --> 24:52.232
Actually...

24:53.412 --> 24:54.463
you're both wrong.

24:55.023 --> 24:56.471
I know who the killer is.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.735
Welcome to Hotel Graciana.

25:17.825 --> 25:18.898
Relax, Delko.

25:20.079 --> 25:21.226
I believe you.

25:22.319 --> 25:24.893
I hate it when people jump
to conclusions, don't you ?

25:26.745 --> 25:28.090
Beg your pardon ?

25:28.236 --> 25:31.211
Tanning oil-- hotel has
someone who applies it.

25:31.258 --> 25:32.920
He oiled all of us.

25:35.676 --> 25:37.306
Well, maybe he robbed us.

25:37.941 --> 25:38.861
Maybe.

25:39.895 --> 25:40.667
Will you excuse us...

25:40.667 --> 25:41.854
Okay, I'll start with this room.

25:43.057 --> 25:43.602
Hang on.

25:44.062 --> 25:45.736
Got to clear a path first.

25:46.146 --> 25:47.802
A path to what ?
There's no body.

25:48.258 --> 25:49.415
Found some blood.

25:49.486 --> 25:51.276
Looks like this is
where our vic bought it.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.616
I'll take one of the bedrooms.

25:55.690 --> 25:57.302
I guess I'll start in here then.

26:04.975 --> 26:05.521
Sir ?

26:05.954 --> 26:06.636
You need something ?

26:06.707 --> 26:09.129
No, I'm just expanding
the crime scene.

26:09.430 --> 26:10.573
All right, well, let me help you.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.907
- I'll put up some more tape.
- Great, thank you.

26:14.277 --> 26:15.257
Oh, he's right.

26:16.629 --> 26:17.866
There's some blood.

26:18.801 --> 26:20.398
Could be a trail.

26:20.490 --> 26:22.158
Maybe this will lead us
to the crime scene.

26:23.273 --> 26:23.862
Really ?

26:24.721 --> 26:25.488
Yeah.

26:26.508 --> 26:28.573
It's definitely gravitational,
you see that ?

26:29.508 --> 26:31.291
Blood points
in the direction of travel.

26:32.389 --> 26:33.924
It's toward the stairwell.

26:45.476 --> 26:47.299
Looks like I found
where the guy was killed.

26:52.372 --> 26:53.784
Went over the railing here,

26:54.089 --> 26:55.587
hit the stairs down there.

26:56.300 --> 26:57.981
Looks like our blunt force trauma.

26:58.925 --> 27:00.423
I'll secure the area, sir.

27:00.481 --> 27:02.457
Uh, it's just Ryan, okay ?

27:03.763 --> 27:05.312
You are, Ryan Wolfe. I...

27:05.893 --> 27:09.245
I thought I recognized you.
From the Erica Sikes, TV.

27:09.883 --> 27:10.659
Yeah, great.

27:10.659 --> 27:12.976
Could you just make sure
nobody comes back here ?

27:14.743 --> 27:15.756
Is that evidence ?

27:16.324 --> 27:16.728
What ?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.855
Yeah, that's a contact lens.

27:41.086 --> 27:41.996
So what do you think ?

27:42.991 --> 27:44.339
Accident ? Homicide ?

27:44.474 --> 27:45.204
Suicide ?

27:45.675 --> 27:47.270
Based on the height of the rail...

27:49.856 --> 27:51.569
I would see hand marks if he fell.

27:52.147 --> 27:53.214
From bracing himself ?

27:53.253 --> 27:55.284
Exactly. And he
probably didn't jump,

27:55.351 --> 27:57.056
'cause he was bleeding
from the head, so chances are,

27:57.058 --> 27:58.188
he was probably too weak.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.665
Leaves one option.

28:00.735 --> 28:01.409
Yeah, murder.

28:05.773 --> 28:08.046
It looks like our killer
left a calling card.

28:18.203 --> 28:18.760
Ryan ?

28:19.274 --> 28:20.578
Just the man I
was looking for.

28:20.578 --> 28:21.859
Erica, not now, I'm busy.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.312
I need to ask you something.

28:23.557 --> 28:25.808
If it's a question about the case,
I can't give an answer.

28:26.365 --> 28:27.118
Okay,

28:27.752 --> 28:29.422
it isn't, but point made.

28:31.850 --> 28:32.609
Well, come on, what is it ?

28:32.672 --> 28:35.178
I need to get reimbursed
for that DAT you busted.

28:35.597 --> 28:37.182
You know, from the whole
Mala Noche thing.

28:37.199 --> 28:38.481
My producers have been
hounding me, and...

28:38.481 --> 28:39.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
how much is it ?

28:40.233 --> 28:41.183
500 bucks.

28:41.412 --> 28:42.575
500 bucks ?

28:42.871 --> 28:44.049
For a recorder ?

28:44.306 --> 28:46.522
Are you kidding ?
What is it, dipped in gold ?

28:46.589 --> 28:48.635
Erica, I work for the county.
I can't afford that.

28:48.732 --> 28:50.170
I didn't break it, Ryan

28:54.371 --> 28:56.763
I'll give you more
when I get my paycheck.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.317
You know I'm good for the rest.

28:59.873 --> 29:01.542
Pleasure doing business with you.

29:07.366 --> 29:09.378
Get in line, Ryan,
I'm completely buried.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.236
Where's Markham ?

29:10.405 --> 29:11.934
Took a personal day... again.

29:12.737 --> 29:14.851
I got a bloody shoeprint
from the hotel murder.

29:15.448 --> 29:16.915
Shoeprint ? This is Firearms.

29:17.927 --> 29:19.737
Firearms does patterns
and impressions.

29:20.369 --> 29:21.873
Markham never told me that.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.197
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

29:23.899 --> 29:25.046
Got a partial here.

29:27.231 --> 29:29.440
Mm. Least I know what I'm
doing with a computer.

29:37.004 --> 29:38.606
I'll run it through
image recovery.

29:38.683 --> 29:39.737
We should get something.

29:47.552 --> 29:48.352
Looks like a...

29:48.659 --> 29:49.695
looks like a logo.

29:50.516 --> 29:51.091
No, no,

29:51.195 --> 29:52.431
it's lettering, maybe ?

29:52.523 --> 29:55.738
All right, I'll run it
against the font database.

30:05.142 --> 30:07.370
P-R-A-D-A.

30:07.777 --> 30:09.161
That spells expensive.

30:10.067 --> 30:11.554
I think I know somebody
who can afford them.

30:17.762 --> 30:19.952
I swear, I didn't kill anyone.

30:21.224 --> 30:21.730
I got a

30:22.196 --> 30:25.229
call from the penthouse suite,
asking me to move a body.

30:25.617 --> 30:27.292
Is that just one of
your many services ?

30:27.362 --> 30:29.904
The woman said it was an
accident, and I believed her.

30:30.443 --> 30:31.670
What woman called you ?

30:32.191 --> 30:33.450
Didn't ask her name.

30:34.627 --> 30:37.272
The hotel caters to VIPs.
I've learned to be discreet.

30:40.084 --> 30:42.097
So just walk me through this.

30:43.603 --> 30:44.727
Well, I went to the penthouse,

30:44.957 --> 30:46.123
the body wasn't there.

30:46.419 --> 30:48.349
I thought it was a prank,
but then I saw the blood.

31:09.521 --> 31:10.750
If you were in the penthouse,

31:10.863 --> 31:13.109
why was your footprint
in the stairwell ?

31:13.406 --> 31:16.175
When I left the suite,
I heard something.

31:27.474 --> 31:28.490
Different place,

31:28.823 --> 31:30.932
same corpse the woman told me about.

31:33.344 --> 31:35.451
I had to move the body.

31:37.566 --> 31:38.407
Okay, so

31:38.907 --> 31:41.914
you dumped the body
in the front lawn of your hotel.

31:42.381 --> 31:44.466
Come on, Craig,
that's not very "discreet."

31:44.506 --> 31:45.281
No, I-I...

31:46.955 --> 31:48.936
put him in the trunk
of my car, but

31:49.005 --> 31:50.036
as I was pulling out,

31:50.066 --> 31:51.167
he came to.

31:56.321 --> 31:57.450
Help ! Someone !

32:03.560 --> 32:04.577
Oh, and that's
when you killed him.

32:04.695 --> 32:06.336
No ! I let him go. I actually

32:06.601 --> 32:07.764
watched him walk away.

32:07.961 --> 32:09.468
And if that's true, Craig,

32:09.476 --> 32:11.624
how did the dead body end up
on the front lawn of the hotel ?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.414
I have no idea !
I know it sounds insane,

32:13.418 --> 32:14.385
but it's true.

32:15.168 --> 32:16.787
I mean, how could I make
something like that up ?

32:16.823 --> 32:19.219
Craig, people lie to
the cops all the time.

32:21.371 --> 32:22.769
Hang on, I got proof.

32:24.265 --> 32:26.852
He tried to bribe me
to let him go.

32:27.071 --> 32:28.246
He gave me this.

32:30.230 --> 32:32.256
It's worth about 50 grand at least.

32:33.056 --> 32:33.877
Please.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.490
All right,
get out of here.

32:37.260 --> 32:39.202
I didn't accept it as a bribe.

32:39.494 --> 32:41.619
I just took it because I knew
it didn't belong to him.

32:47.748 --> 32:48.556
Yvette ?

32:50.123 --> 32:51.991
I guess you know who called me.

32:54.010 --> 32:55.788
I think she did more than that.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.735
Dennis and Yvette, 1998.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.283
Where did you get it ?

33:07.070 --> 33:08.977
Apparently, Armando Diaz had it.

33:09.011 --> 33:11.328
- The guy who died ?
- Yeah, the guy you pushed.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.911
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.213
He must have stolen it

33:15.213 --> 33:16.489
when he was oiling me up.

33:16.585 --> 33:18.102
See, I might believe you...

33:19.755 --> 33:21.780
except I found this
at the crime scene.

33:23.188 --> 33:23.997
What's that ?

33:24.192 --> 33:27.510
It really must be hard to walk
around with one contact in.

33:35.845 --> 33:37.370
Look, it was an accident.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.795
Armando and I...

33:40.396 --> 33:41.261
hung out

33:41.383 --> 33:43.423
at his cabana earlier that day.

33:44.496 --> 33:45.844
You mean you had sex with him.

33:46.713 --> 33:47.245
Correct.

33:48.538 --> 33:51.118
The ring was in my purse,
I figured he must have taken it,

33:51.118 --> 33:52.438
so I went to find him.

33:52.573 --> 33:54.496
You're crazy !
I don't have your ring.

33:54.517 --> 33:56.604
I can see it there in your pocket !

34:01.641 --> 34:02.638
Oh, my God.

34:03.028 --> 34:04.536
If the ring's so important,

34:04.598 --> 34:06.326
why didn't you grab it
when he was out cold ?

34:06.488 --> 34:08.408
Well, I wanted to,
but I couldn't.

34:08.501 --> 34:09.649
Someone was coming.

34:23.105 --> 34:24.742
That was the manager
that you called.

34:26.914 --> 34:28.458
I didn't call anybody.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.333
Well, you better call your lawyer.

34:36.873 --> 34:38.092
No, it was Felicia.

34:38.145 --> 34:39.733
The guy conked out right next her,

34:39.733 --> 34:41.322
she failed to call 911,

34:41.330 --> 34:42.719
then decided to skip town.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.208
It's negligent homicide.

34:44.603 --> 34:45.525
Actually,

34:46.293 --> 34:47.302
you're both wrong.

34:47.371 --> 34:48.661
I know who the killer is.

34:49.510 --> 34:50.815
Diaz was killed on the stairs.

34:50.815 --> 34:52.398
Yvette pushed him over the railing.

34:53.222 --> 34:54.202
Which stairs ?

34:54.237 --> 34:56.645
Utility stairs outside
the penthouse suite.

34:56.813 --> 34:58.395
I found a pool of the victim's blood.

34:58.452 --> 35:01.025
The guy bled all over the hotel.
How does that prove anything ?

35:01.102 --> 35:03.320
Okay, let's not do this
in front of the suspects.

35:06.115 --> 35:07.995
I don't understand.
Beth confessed.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.259
Felicia told me straight out
that Armando hit his head

35:10.312 --> 35:11.613
while they were having sex.

35:11.659 --> 35:14.380
Okay, I have a weapon
covered in Armando's blood

35:14.405 --> 35:15.999
with Beth's hair on it.

35:18.384 --> 35:19.850
Cause of death, please.

35:20.598 --> 35:21.926
Blunt force trauma.

35:22.303 --> 35:24.012
Which was Alexx's first impression

35:24.043 --> 35:26.554
while she waited for
somebody to show up at post.

35:28.314 --> 35:31.003
- I thought you guys went.
- We thought you did.

35:31.067 --> 35:33.006
We never assume anything, do we ?

35:35.554 --> 35:37.368
Oh, that's Alexx's report.

35:41.402 --> 35:42.741
What's the cause of death ?

35:42.929 --> 35:44.683
Fracture of the cervical spine.

35:45.030 --> 35:46.446
Died of a broken neck.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.206
Caused by his header down the stairs.

35:48.206 --> 35:49.801
But his jaw was intact,

35:49.900 --> 35:52.767
which it wouldn't have been
if the fall broke his neck.

35:52.871 --> 35:54.272
So someone broke it for him.

35:54.309 --> 35:54.960
Right.

35:58.773 --> 35:59.591
But who ?

36:15.058 --> 36:15.728
Okay,

36:15.915 --> 36:19.474
so we know that Armando was
in three separate altercations.

36:19.622 --> 36:20.944
None of which killed him.

36:21.205 --> 36:22.726
Well, the guy had stamina.

36:22.773 --> 36:23.983
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.905
He was with Felicia Hardy
for over two hours.

36:25.988 --> 36:27.537
With pharmaceutical assistance.

36:27.821 --> 36:29.269
Oh, yeah ?
He took Viagra ?

36:29.379 --> 36:30.848
Beth Johnson saw him take it.

36:36.545 --> 36:39.428
Which means that he was with
Beth Johnson before Felicia.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.181
And I found his blood
on the head (???)

36:46.825 --> 36:47.800
And then Yvette.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.474
I don't have your ring.

36:49.524 --> 36:51.428
I can see it right there
in your pocket.

36:55.924 --> 36:57.556
And then he ended up
in the stairwell

36:57.599 --> 36:59.425
for the manager to finish him off ?

37:02.985 --> 37:04.988
Yeah, but the manager
said he didn't do it.

37:05.093 --> 37:07.604
Do we have any evidence
to prove that he was lying ?

37:07.677 --> 37:09.942
Like trace from the victim's body ?

37:10.835 --> 37:11.679
Well, I...

37:12.673 --> 37:14.009
I didn't tape lift him.

37:14.343 --> 37:15.746
I thought you usually did that.

37:15.778 --> 37:17.481
No, you were supposed to...

37:18.481 --> 37:19.553
All right, look.

37:19.739 --> 37:20.752
Never assume.

37:21.444 --> 37:22.732
The clothes are right here.

37:33.178 --> 37:34.756
Armando was covered in lint.

37:35.199 --> 37:37.250
Didn't you see cotton fibers
in his hair at the scene ?

37:37.329 --> 37:40.713
And my suspect had traces of
laundry detergent on her luggage.

37:40.979 --> 37:41.611
Okay,

37:42.629 --> 37:43.559
we got lint,

37:43.837 --> 37:44.956
cotton fibers,

37:45.738 --> 37:46.671
detergent.

37:49.424 --> 37:51.072
We've missed a crime scene.

37:54.662 --> 37:57.096
Can't imagine what their
electricity bill's like here.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.441
How many pounds of laundry you think
they go through in this hotel ?

37:59.511 --> 38:00.685
Try tons.

38:01.845 --> 38:03.913
And they still can't
get the blood out.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.329
This is where our vic was killed.

38:10.876 --> 38:13.642
The strength it would take
to subdue Armando, let alone

38:14.088 --> 38:15.303
snap his neck...

38:15.585 --> 38:16.900
And a woman doesn't have it,

38:16.962 --> 38:18.710
no matter how much she works out.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.466
Brings us back to the manager.

38:28.961 --> 38:30.517
Or whoever left the print.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.845
There is one more
man in the picture.

38:39.888 --> 38:42.709
We are going to sue your
entire department for this.

38:42.773 --> 38:44.126
Fine, maybe your lawyer

38:44.154 --> 38:46.780
can explain your husband's
handprint in the victim's blood.

38:47.588 --> 38:49.684
This was left by Armando's killer.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.946
And this is a thumbprint

38:53.189 --> 38:54.821
left when your husband
picked up your luggage.

38:54.870 --> 38:57.672
It only takes one print
to match to a person.

38:57.706 --> 38:59.305
And we compared the handprint

38:59.399 --> 39:01.034
to the print on your luggage.

39:04.747 --> 39:07.489
My guess is it was just a happy
coincidence you ran into

39:07.541 --> 39:09.819
Armando Diaz in the parking lot.

39:13.856 --> 39:15.902
Armando had been
through a lot already.

39:15.961 --> 39:17.774
Probably didn't have
much fight in him.

39:26.001 --> 39:27.908
This is ridiculous.
I wasn't even here.

39:28.213 --> 39:30.307
Steven was in Miramar
when I called him.

39:30.377 --> 39:32.212
It's a 45-minute drive.

39:32.408 --> 39:34.030
Did you call him on his cell phone ?

39:34.607 --> 39:36.673
How do you know
exactly where he was ?

39:37.180 --> 39:38.613
All right, you know,
that's enough.

39:38.686 --> 39:40.993
Felicia, don't say anything else
until we talk to Jerry.

39:43.116 --> 39:43.673
Hold on.

39:43.911 --> 39:45.563
Take a last look at
this other picture

39:45.563 --> 39:47.608
from when you were loading
luggage in your car.

39:47.681 --> 39:49.371
And notice the windshield.

39:49.409 --> 39:51.480
Looks like you got caught
in a little rainstorm.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.661
Even though it was 70 and sunny
in Miramar all day.

39:55.041 --> 39:55.850
We checked.

39:56.652 --> 40:00.005
Miami had a sun shower
between 11:03 and 11:14.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.001
That's right.

40:01.077 --> 40:03.889
Your windshield was in Miami at 11:00.

40:04.332 --> 40:06.200
Which means that you were, too.

40:09.108 --> 40:10.145
You were here.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.128
You were spying on me ?

40:16.292 --> 40:17.000
Felicia...

40:18.469 --> 40:20.871
You've shown no interest in me
in the last two years

40:20.871 --> 40:22.448
and you're spying on me ?

40:22.724 --> 40:24.184
That doesn't make sense.

40:26.142 --> 40:27.357
I know, I know.

40:28.543 --> 40:29.893
Then what were you doing here ?

41:00.990 --> 41:02.156
Which one ?

41:08.191 --> 41:10.052
I'm sorry, Felicia.

41:10.418 --> 41:11.483
I really am.

41:12.417 --> 41:15.496
Yeah, and Mr. Hardy doesn't like
his mistress cheating on him.

41:16.305 --> 41:17.509
You slept with this guy ?

41:17.591 --> 41:18.177
What ?

41:18.452 --> 41:20.021
I don't see you leaving
your wife anytime soon.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.394
Doesn't mean you can
screw around on me.

41:25.365 --> 41:26.956
You were my Maid of Honor.

41:28.524 --> 41:31.436
So you sleep with steven
and my Armando.

41:32.619 --> 41:34.731
"My Armando" ?

41:35.025 --> 41:37.205
You know, I thought
this was a wives' weekend.

41:37.288 --> 41:38.117
No sex.

41:38.940 --> 41:40.304
Look who's talking.

41:40.609 --> 41:41.573
Home wrecker.

41:42.255 --> 41:43.835
I thought we were friends.

41:45.509 --> 41:47.030
We don't even know each other.

41:47.446 --> 41:49.172
We know each other, Felicia.

41:49.866 --> 41:51.593
We just don't like each other.

42:11.115 --> 42:13.648
Here's to our first wives' weekend.

42:13.710 --> 42:14.597
The first of many.

42:14.648 --> 42:16.089
Ever year for the rest of our lives.

42:16.148 --> 42:18.441
Here's to doing this
till we are old and gray.

42:18.717 --> 42:22.244
I read the hotel has
this guy that oils you up.

42:22.759 --> 42:23.535
Sweet.

42:23.915 --> 42:26.246
So long as that's all he does.
