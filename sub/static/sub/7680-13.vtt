Westport Nuclear Processing.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.589
Amy Austin.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.591
KRAMER: Yes, this is
Sergeant Kramer, State Police.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.593
Uh, what is it, Sergeant?

00:26.593 --> 00:29.596
Do you know a Mr. Gerald Hillman?

00:29.596 --> 00:31.097
Of course.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.099
He's my boss, but I'm afraid
he's not here right now.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.602
He left several hours ago for New York.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.604
Why? Is something the matter?

00:37.604 --> 00:39.105
Yes, ma'am.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.108
We're still investigating, but
for some unexplained reason,

00:42.108 --> 00:44.110
his car ran off the road, hit a bridge.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.112
And Mr. Hillman? He's...

00:46.112 --> 00:48.114
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am,

00:48.114 --> 00:50.116
but he's dead.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.622
Ready?

00:56.122 --> 00:57.123
Three-to-one.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.125
I love it, MacGyver.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.127
You got lucky, eh?

01:01.127 --> 01:03.630
I used to date Wayne Gretzky.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.131
Come on, stop stalling.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.133
Once more for all the marbles.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.135
Okay.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.638
All right, hoser.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.642
Here we go, eh?

01:16.142 --> 01:17.644
Don't want you to be
nervous or nothin', you know.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.645
(laughs)

01:19.145 --> 01:20.647
I mean, I'm part Canadian,
you know what I mean?

01:20.647 --> 01:21.648
You look it. (beep)

01:21.648 --> 01:22.649
And there's the face-off

01:22.649 --> 01:23.650
at the start of the defensive end.

01:23.650 --> 01:24.651
Oh, I have a great block!

01:25.151 --> 01:26.152
Oh, it's a beautiful pass on the wing.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.654
Makes a shot over another wing!

01:27.654 --> 01:29.155
Oh, you're a dead man !
And there's a shot! Oh!

01:29.155 --> 01:31.157
I appreciate the call.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.159
Thank you, Sergeant.

od. Oh, here... go

02:45.231 --> 02:46.232
Come on!

02:46.733 --> 02:47.734
at. (laughs): Give me th

02:47.734 --> 02:48.735
They look a little slow today.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.236
Must be the humidity, eh?

02:51.738 --> 02:52.739
(mutters)

02:52.739 --> 02:54.240
... Grim and determined. Almost

02:54.741 --> 02:55.742
Shot into the corner!

02:55.742 --> 02:57.744
(laughs): Oh! Hey!

02:59.245 --> 03:01.247
Oh! Almost!

03:01.247 --> 03:04.250
Which counts for absolutely nothing.

(raspy breathing)

03:54.300 --> 03:56.302
(buzzing continues)

04:11.317 --> 04:12.318
He's about to break away.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.820
Takes a shot. He shoots! He scores!

04:13.820 --> 04:14.821
Unbelievable!

04:14.821 --> 04:16.322
Off the face! Shoot!

04:16.322 --> 04:18.825
Trickled into the net,
and that's the game!

04:19.325 --> 04:20.827
(sighs)

04:20.827 --> 04:21.827
The fans go crazy.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.329
(imitates crowd cheering)

04:23.830 --> 04:25.832
Now, that was for all the marbles.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.834
MacGyver...

04:28.334 --> 04:30.336
Susan...

04:30.336 --> 04:32.839
Are you gonna play fair,
or do I spread the word

04:32.839 --> 04:34.340
about how totally dishonest you are?

04:34.340 --> 04:36.843
Totally, eh?

04:38.344 --> 04:40.346
Okay, one more time.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.347
One more time, eh?

04:41.347 --> 04:42.348
Yeah, I like that accent.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.851
What accent, eh?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.354
Waiting for the face-off.

04:48.354 --> 04:52.358
This one literally for all...

04:52.358 --> 04:53.359
(beep) the marbles...

05:06.372 --> 05:09.375
(phone rings)

05:09.375 --> 05:11.377
I'm not home, okay?

05:11.377 --> 05:13.880
Come on!

05:13.880 --> 05:15.381
MacGYVER: Hello. This isnotMacGyver.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.383
So, obviously, you've
reached a wrong number.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.385
But if you need to leave a message...

05:19.385 --> 05:20.887
Shoots-- unbelievable!
Off his face again!

05:21.387 --> 05:22.889
...if he happens by.

05:23.389 --> 05:23.890
(beep)

05:24.390 --> 05:24.891
AMY: Mac, if you're home,

05:25.391 --> 05:25.892
pick up the phone.

05:26.392 --> 05:26.893
I need to talk to you!

05:27.393 --> 05:27.894
This is Amy Austin.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.396
Hold it.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.398
Yeah, Amy?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.400
Mac, Mac, I'm in trouble.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.403
Amy, what is it?

05:37.403 --> 05:38.905
Oh, Mac, I need you.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.407
Look, if it's real serious,
I can be there by tomorrow.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.910
I'll catch a plane out tonight.

05:43.910 --> 05:44.911
What's wrong?

05:44.911 --> 05:46.412
Well, I don't really know.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.914
I mean, a friend of mine died, and,

05:47.914 --> 05:49.916
oh, I don't know who to trust.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.919
Mac, please, please, I need your help.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.421
I think someone's trying to kill me.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.923
Look, look, I know I
don't have any right

05:56.923 --> 05:57.924
to involve you in this, but...

05:57.924 --> 06:00.426
Hey, wait a minute.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.428
You've got every right.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.431
Where do we meet?

06:05.431 --> 06:07.433
The beach,ourbeach.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.435
(raspy breathing)

06:12.939 --> 06:14.440
d! AMY: Oh my Go

06:18.945 --> 06:20.947
Amy, can't you tell me
a little bit about...?

06:21.447 --> 06:22.448
Amy?

06:22.448 --> 06:25.952
Amy?Amy?!

06:26.452 --> 06:27.954
Amy, are you there?

06:27.954 --> 06:29.455
(raspy breathing)

06:29.455 --> 06:30.957
Am--

06:37.463 --> 06:40.466
Mac, you okay?

06:46.973 --> 06:50.476
(suspenseful theme music playing)

06:51.477 --> 06:53.980
?? ??

07:06.993 --> 07:08.995
(adventurous theme plays)

07:35.021 --> 07:38.024
?? ??

08:21.067 --> 08:23.569
MacGYVER: The past is a strange country.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.571
You go back,

08:25.571 --> 08:28.574
but it doesn't recognize you.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.078
I'd changed in ways I didn't know,

08:32.078 --> 08:36.082
and if I was a stranger, so was Amy.

08:36.082 --> 08:40.086
Used to be Amy and me, one word.

08:40.086 --> 08:43.589
Back in that time, in this place.

08:43.589 --> 08:46.092
(seagulls screeching)

08:46.092 --> 08:48.094
Amy stayed.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.096
I've moved on.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.598
And what had been between us changed,

08:52.598 --> 08:55.101
stretched out over distance and time.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.605
I remember this beach.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.610
There were palm trees then.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.617
?? I remember when rock was young ??

09:11.617 --> 09:15.121
?? Me and Suzie had so much fun ??

09:15.121 --> 09:18.124
?? Holding hands and skimming stones ??

09:18.624 --> 09:21.627
?? Had an old gold Chevy
and a place of my own ??

09:21.627 --> 09:23.629
?? But the biggest kick I ever got ??

09:24.130 --> 09:25.131
(laughs)

09:25.631 --> 09:27.133
?? Was doing a thing
called the Crocodile Rock ??

09:27.633 --> 09:29.635
?? While the other kids were
rocking round the clock... ? ?

09:29.635 --> 09:31.137
. Well, right on time, as usual

09:31.637 --> 09:34.640
Well, I had a good excuse, as usual.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.643
k, Hey, I thought you
wanted to have a major tal

09:38.144 --> 09:40.646
or did you mean some serious making out?

09:40.646 --> 09:43.149
. (laughs): Oh, ho, ho, ho

09:43.149 --> 09:45.151
You look like you're about to burst.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.153
So, what is it?

09:47.153 --> 09:48.654
You remember that
freighter I told you about?

09:48.654 --> 09:50.656
Uh, yeah, something
about bucketing around

09:50.656 --> 09:52.158
the Mediterranean Ocean or something.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.659
Yeah, it's a sea, and it's the Adriatic.

09:54.160 --> 09:54.660
Oh.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.164
Amy, it's the Greek Islands.

09:58.164 --> 10:01.167
It's Sicily, North
Africa, and it's all set.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.168
You and me.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.170
I talked to the
captain. He needs a cook.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.671
He'll sign us both up.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.173
Mac, you signed me up? You bet.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.674
Oh, honey, that's crazy!

10:08.674 --> 10:09.675
Yeah, it is!

10:10.176 --> 10:12.178
Come on, we talked
about this. Traveling.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.180
Yeah, talk.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.681
And what about your degree?

10:15.681 --> 10:17.683
I mean, Mac,

10:18.184 --> 10:19.185
, ten miles down that coastline

10:19.185 --> 10:21.687
they're-they're building
a nuclear processing plant.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.191
They're gonna need people
with science degrees.

10:25.191 --> 10:28.194
Mac, we could have
a real future there...

10:28.194 --> 10:31.197
together.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.698
Amy,

10:32.698 --> 10:34.700
I took physics because
it was interesting,

10:34.700 --> 10:38.204
and it excited me, not
to buy myself a job.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.206
Amy, come on, ther
e's a world out there!

10:40.706 --> 10:41.707
Let's go look at it!

10:41.707 --> 10:43.209
Being somethin g different!

10:43.209 --> 10:45.711
I don't want to be different.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.713
I want a life I can count on.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.715
Yeah, that's what I'm
talkin' about-- countin' on--

10:49.715 --> 10:51.717
us, together.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.719
Not some executive recruiter

10:54.220 --> 10:56.722
or a pension plan.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.723
Mac, I can't.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.225
I mean, I never really thought

10:59.225 --> 11:00.726
that you meant something this crazy.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.228
y? Craz

11:02.228 --> 11:05.731
Finding out who I am?

11:05.731 --> 11:07.233
Well, maybe.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.235
Maybe you ought to go.

11:09.235 --> 11:13.739
?? If words could make
wishe s come true... ??

11:13.739 --> 11:15.241
Just like that?

11:15.241 --> 11:16.242
? ?? I'd save every day... ?

11:16.742 --> 11:17.743
I don't know.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.745
?? ?? Like a treasure and then

11:20.246 --> 11:23.749
?? Again, I would spend
them with you... ??

11:23.749 --> 11:25.751
(engine starting)

11:47.773 --> 11:52.278
(horn honking)

11:58.284 --> 12:00.786
(no audio)

12:35.321 --> 12:36.822
MacGyver?

12:38.824 --> 12:41.827
It's Tim--
Tim Wexler.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.832
Tim. It's been a while, huh?

12:46.832 --> 12:48.334
Yeah.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.335
(sighing)

12:49.835 --> 12:50.836
The police called the plant.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.340
They told us... about Amy.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.843
Were you here when this happened?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.345
All of it.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.847
Her car just blew up?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.351
I don't think it just blew up, Tim.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.353
Well, what then?

13:07.353 --> 13:09.855
Well, Mr. MacGyver said
Amy called him last night

13:09.855 --> 13:12.358
and said she thought somebody
was trying to kill her.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.359
Well, then this wasn't an accident?

13:13.859 --> 13:14.860
DETECTIVE: Well, my lab people

13:15.361 --> 13:17.863
tell me the evidence shows
it might have been a gas leak.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.865
Tailpipe got too hot,

13:20.366 --> 13:22.368
she stopped here and...

13:22.368 --> 13:23.869
Damn shame.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.372
Lord knows she had enough trouble.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.374
What troubles?

13:28.374 --> 13:29.875
Well, her daddy and mama got killed

13:30.376 --> 13:31.877
in a plane crash about a year ago,

13:31.877 --> 13:33.879
and then just last
night her boss got killed

13:33.879 --> 13:35.381
when his car went out of control.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.383
Jerry Hillman.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.884
nt. The, uh, general manager of the pla

13:39.385 --> 13:40.386
State police

13:40.386 --> 13:42.388
r. found his ca

13:42.888 --> 13:45.391
He ran right into the
old bridge at South Fork.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.892
TRAIN: Knew them both.

13:46.892 --> 13:50.896
I tell you, sometimes this
job is just plain god-awful.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.899
Yeah, I can imagine.

13:53.899 --> 13:57.403
Listen, Chief...

13:57.403 --> 13:59.905
would you mind having
your boys at the lab

13:59.905 --> 14:03.409
take a close look at this
piece of gas tank I found?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.411
Sure. What, what do you have in mind?

14:05.411 --> 14:07.913
Well, if the tank caught on fire,

14:07.913 --> 14:10.416
it would have blown out, right?

14:10.416 --> 14:11.417
Yeah.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.419
Well, look at that little hole there.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.921
It's blowing in.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.424
And I'll bet the boys at the
lab will be able to tell you

14:18.924 --> 14:21.427
that white residue
there is magnesium oxide.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.430
Magnesium oxide-- you
mean that stuff they...?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.932
That's, uh, the explosive
bullet, like a mag point?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.934
Yeah, I don't have any better answer.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.437
If you're right, we're sure
going to start looking for one.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.939
I'd appreciate it.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.444
(sighing)

14:44.950 --> 14:48.954
Her folks are gone, right?

14:48.954 --> 14:50.956
What about Aunt Min?

14:50.956 --> 14:52.958
Or, um, Toby Jenson?

14:53.459 --> 14:54.960
Someone she may have been close to

14:55.461 --> 14:56.462
that she talked to?

14:56.462 --> 14:58.464
Well, Min moved over five years ago,

14:58.464 --> 15:00.966
and I haven't seen Toby
in, uh, a good year.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.969
? But what about, uh,
Amy's roommate, Bonnie

15:03.969 --> 15:05.971
Oh, yeah. We tried to contact her.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.473
She took Friday off.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.475
Probably went away for
a long weekend somewhere.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.477
I don't think she knows about this.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.978
She probably won't make it back

15:12.978 --> 15:14.480
for the funeral.

15:14.980 --> 15:15.981
When is that?

15:15.981 --> 15:17.983
It's tomorrow morning at 10:00.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.485
It's a coroner's case.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.986
Uh, you don't have to go.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.490
Yes, sir, I do.

15:41.006 --> 15:45.511
...so, today, we are to consecrate
the memory of Amy Diane Austin,

15:45.511 --> 15:47.012
whose untimely, tragic death

15:47.513 --> 15:50.015
ended a joyous and loving young life.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.020
We all knew Amy, and cherished her.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.524
We all mourn the passing

15:58.524 --> 16:01.026
of a young and
beautiful woman--

16:01.026 --> 16:03.529
a life ended too soon.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.533
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.035
"The body returneth to the earth,

16:10.035 --> 16:13.038
and the eternal spirit
unto God, who gave it."

16:13.539 --> 16:14.540
Amen.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.541
MOURNE RS: Amen.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.561
Mac.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.063
Don't turn. Amy!

16:38.063 --> 16:41.567
Just drive to my dad's
old place, okay? Please?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.569
(sobbing): Oh, thank God!

16:43.569 --> 16:45.571
Thank God you're here!

16:45.571 --> 16:48.073
(engine starting)

17:00.586 --> 17:01.587
MacGYVER: My God, Amy!

17:01.587 --> 17:04.089
I arrive here yesterday,
in time to see you die,

17:04.589 --> 17:06.592
and just ten minutes ago saw you buried.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.594
AMY: I know it's a shock to you, but...

17:09.094 --> 17:10.596
t. That's one w ay of putting i

17:10.596 --> 17:13.098
g. I mean, here you are--
you're talking, breathin

17:13.598 --> 17:17.102
Mac, I had no choice!

17:17.603 --> 17:21.106
I believe you, Amy, but
somebody died in your car.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.608
Who was that girl?

17:23.108 --> 17:24.609
(sobbing): Bonnie, Mac.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.612
That was my roommate Bonnie!

17:26.612 --> 17:29.114
She was supposed to come pick you up

17:29.114 --> 17:30.616
because I was too scared.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.618
. And she was killed

17:32.618 --> 17:33.619
ed She was kill

17:34.119 --> 17:36.622
because somebody thought she was me.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.123
And you let them bury her

17:38.624 --> 17:40.626
with everyone believing it was you?

17:40.626 --> 17:43.128
Do you have any idea what it did to me

17:43.128 --> 17:45.631
watching them lower
your coffin into a grave?

17:45.631 --> 17:48.133
What it did to everyone at that funeral

17:48.133 --> 17:49.635
who loved and cared about you?

17:50.135 --> 17:53.639
You don't think I thought
about that, or about Bonnie?

17:53.639 --> 17:55.641
I haven't slept in 36 hours.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.143
Mac, I don't

17:58.143 --> 18:00.145
know what to do.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.648
(crying)

18:02.648 --> 18:04.149
All right, come here. I'm sorry.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.151
(crying): Oh, Mac...

18:06.151 --> 18:08.153
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:22.167 --> 18:27.172
All right, tell me
what's going on... slowly.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.174
Okay.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.176
I'm Director of Research

18:31.176 --> 18:33.178
at the nuclear processing plant now.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.680
Three days ago, I found

18:35.180 --> 18:37.683
that somebody had
messed with the records

18:37.683 --> 18:40.185
to cover up the theft of enough uranium

18:40.185 --> 18:42.187
to build a nuclear bomb, Mac.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.690
! A nuclear bomb

18:44.690 --> 18:47.192
Who else have you told this to?

18:47.192 --> 18:49.194
My boss.

18:49.194 --> 18:53.198
The two of us searched the plant
from top to bottom, and nothing.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.202
I think we better go inside.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.203
Come on.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.206
Your boss, Jerry Hillman?

19:01.707 --> 19:04.209
. I see you heard about
his so-called accident

19:04.209 --> 19:06.211
Jerry took a c opy of my records,

19:06.211 --> 19:09.214
and he took off to catch
a plane for Washington.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.217
ac. He made it two mil
es outside of town, M

19:12.217 --> 19:13.719
That's when you called me?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.220
me. Someone was after

19:15.220 --> 19:18.223
I mean, that's why I
sent Bonnie to meet you.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.726
r Mac, I never dreamt
somebody would kill he

19:21.226 --> 19:22.728
because they thought she was me.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.230
(crying) All right,
all right, all right.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.235
Come on, I think we could both use

19:30.235 --> 19:31.737
a cup of coffee, don't you?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.739
Sounds good.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.750
KYLE: Tim, you want some coffee?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.251
TIM: No, thanks.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.758
d"? "Most Likely to Succee

19:53.258 --> 19:54.259
had Boy, you sure

19:54.259 --> 19:56.762
m? them fooled, huh, Ti

19:56.762 --> 19:59.264
(chuckling softly)

19:59.264 --> 20:02.267
Yeah. Ever wonder why we
hang onto these yearbooks?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.770
Oh, my wife and I pulled
ours out last week.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.271
It's just kicks, that's all.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.773
Yeah. A chance to remember

20:08.273 --> 20:10.776
those bright hopes for the future, huh?

20:10.776 --> 20:13.278
How we were going to get to be somebody,

20:13.278 --> 20:14.780
do something really worthwhile.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.783
(phone ringing)

20:18.283 --> 20:21.286
Westport Nuclear; Tim Wexler.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.288
No, nothing.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.289
What?

20:26.792 --> 20:28.293
W-When did that come out?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.297
My God.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.803
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.305
Thanks.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.807
What is it?

20:41.807 --> 20:43.809
Tim?

20:44.309 --> 20:50.315
Uh... Coroner's Office just
made their findings public.

20:50.315 --> 20:53.318
Amy Austin isn't the girl
that burned up in that car.

21:13.338 --> 21:14.840
Here. Drink.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.842
Mac, I can't.

21:16.842 --> 21:17.843
Drink.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.851
Better?

21:25.851 --> 21:28.353
(quavering breath)

21:28.353 --> 21:29.855
I'm sorry.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.857
Look, have you got a
handkerchief, or something?

21:32.357 --> 21:34.359
Uh, yeah.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.361
Yeah, I think so.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.368
You always carried a pocketful of junk.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.870
Yeah.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.372
And you always fixed everything.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.375
(sobbing)

21:50.375 --> 21:52.878
I'm sorry.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.882
(sobbing)

21:56.882 --> 21:59.384
I'm okay now.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.887
Honest?

22:01.887 --> 22:03.889
Honest.

22:06.391 --> 22:09.895
How long has it been
since we were together?

22:10.395 --> 22:12.898
e. A lot of tim

22:12.898 --> 22:15.400
e. Not much els

22:17.903 --> 22:21.406
And one red rose from
you every birthday.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.909
Well, you used to li
ke that kind of stuff.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.911
I still do.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.914
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

22:47.933 --> 22:48.934
Mmm.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.436
I still remember how you taste.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.941
Thank you, Mac.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.443
Thank you for coming.

22:58.443 --> 23:01.947
Everyone I could possibly turn to is...

23:01.947 --> 23:04.449
they're already dead.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.458
I'm here, Amy.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.461
it. And we'll get to the bottom of

23:16.962 --> 23:18.463
All the way.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.474
This audit report you hid.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.476
e? Does it show theft
over a period of tim

23:31.977 --> 23:32.978
Yeah, little by little.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.980
They must have hidden it away.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.482
Well, must be somebo
dy from the plant then.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.984
Or an inspector, or a supplier.

23:39.484 --> 23:40.986
I mean, lots of people had access.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.488
Well, it's probabl y a group then.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.491
re. We are talking about big bucks he

23:46.491 --> 23:48.493
up. Sure adds

23:48.493 --> 23:50.495
The question is, what do I do?

23:50.495 --> 23:52.998
. We get your report...
then we tell the world

23:52.998 --> 23:53.999
en. We'll get them to list

23:54.499 --> 23:55.500
Mac, it's Sunday.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.502
There's hardly anyone even there.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.004
re. Security's the

23:59.004 --> 24:00.505
re. Phones are the

24:05.510 --> 24:07.512
Yeah.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.540
?? ??

25:01.566 --> 25:03.068
(sighs)

25:04.569 --> 25:06.071
Do you really think it's possible

25:06.071 --> 25:08.073
the uranium's still at the plant?

25:08.073 --> 25:09.074
Well, it's t he only reason

25:09.574 --> 25:11.076
. I can come up wi th for two killings

25:11.076 --> 25:12.577
How 'bout you?

25:13.078 --> 25:15.580
I'm right out of explanations, Mac.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.583
Right now, I'm jus t barely hanging on.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.586
You always were pretty good at that.

25:21.586 --> 25:23.088
Uh-uh.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.090
ce. I let go too easily on

25:28.593 --> 25:31.096
Shall we?

25:31.096 --> 25:32.597
MacGYVER: So, where'd you hide it?

25:32.597 --> 25:36.101
The last place anybody'd
look: the disposal chamber.

25:36.101 --> 25:39.104
They only backwash the
reactors once a week.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.106
I figured it'd be safe till then.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.108
MacGYVER: Last place I'd want to be in.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.113
e. Hey, nic

25:48.113 --> 25:49.614
Love what you've done with the place.

25:49.614 --> 25:51.116
y. It's a beaut

25:51.116 --> 25:52.617
It does the job.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.619
Look, trust me, MacGyver,

25:54.619 --> 25:56.621
if we were in here when
this valve cranks open,

25:57.122 --> 25:58.623
we'd be fried to a crisp.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.626
ush 5,000 gallons of radioactive sl

26:01.626 --> 26:04.129
ed. comes pouring in h
ere to be decontaminat

26:04.129 --> 26:07.132
Slush? Ooh, not the time to be in here.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.633
What do you say we get the report?

26:08.633 --> 26:10.135
Right.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.141
Well, all there.

26:16.141 --> 26:19.644
? Then it's all downhill from here

26:22.147 --> 26:24.649
Oh, God, Mac!

26:25.650 --> 26:27.152
Damn!

26:27.652 --> 26:29.654
(alarm buzzing)

26:33.158 --> 26:34.659
What's the setup on this door?

26:34.659 --> 26:36.661
Uh, an electro nic time-lock,

26:36.661 --> 26:38.163
t, but, Mac, on ce it's been se

26:38.163 --> 26:41.166
it can't be opened f
or 60 minutes minimum.

26:54.179 --> 26:56.181
ed! Mac, it's been activat

26:57.182 --> 26:58.683
Excuse me, Amy, um,

26:58.683 --> 27:01.686
how soon before that sludge
comes racing out of there?

27:01.686 --> 27:03.688
t. It's already start
ed. I can feel the hea

27:04.189 --> 27:05.690
And how hot is it going to get in here?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.192
Mac, before it reaches this room,

27:07.192 --> 27:08.693
it'll get too hot for us to breathe.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.195
Oh, wonderful.

27:10.695 --> 27:12.197
And how long before that happens?

27:12.197 --> 27:13.698
About ten minutes.

27:17.202 --> 27:18.703
Great.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.055
Well, I'll tell you, I sure don't feel

27:37.055 --> 27:38.556
like sitting around and being chewed up

27:38.556 --> 27:41.559
by your radioactive garbage
disposal, that's for sure.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.061
Our only hope is Control.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.562
I mean, if they look at the board

27:44.562 --> 27:46.064
and see the chamber door indicators,

27:46.064 --> 27:48.066
Mac, they're going to
know something's wrong.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.068
It's Sunday.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.070
Don't you think that's asking a lot?

27:52.070 --> 27:53.571
ANNOUNCER: Parsons hits a long fly ball

27:53.571 --> 27:54.572
t. into right center... KYLE: All righ

27:54.572 --> 27:56.074
Parsons a double to center field,

27:56.574 --> 27:58.076

27:58.076 --> 28:00.078
Safe. I got your five bucks, Tim.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.079
it. I got

28:01.579 --> 28:03.581
We'll see.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.086
(beeping)

28:08.586 --> 28:10.588
What about climbing up
through the valve opening?

28:11.089 --> 28:12.090
Where's that go?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.591
Straight t o the core.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.592
Forget it.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.095
k. Oh, come on, think, Amy, thin

28:17.095 --> 28:18.096
All right, wait a minute.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.098
Bottom line, the only way out of here

28:20.098 --> 28:21.099
is through that door.

28:21.599 --> 28:24.102
t. Mac, we've alrea dy been through tha

28:24.102 --> 28:26.104
Time-locked, right?

28:26.104 --> 28:28.106
Time-locked,
pick-proof.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.609
Electric time clock?

28:32.110 --> 28:33.111
o. With 59 minutes to g

28:33.611 --> 28:35.613
Mac, we've got nine.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.116
Unless we do some time travel.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.618
Meaning?

28:40.618 --> 28:42.620
Electric time clock measures time

28:43.121 --> 28:44.622
with an oscillating quartz crystal,

28:44.622 --> 28:47.625
so if we can hit it with
a hot electrical surge...

28:47.625 --> 28:49.127
But wouldn't that just burn it out?

28:49.127 --> 28:51.629
Well, that'd be th e end result, yeah.

28:51.629 --> 28:53.631
The immediate result would be to set up

28:53.631 --> 28:55.633
a violent secondary vibration.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.635
Which would speed up the clock.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.636
d. It shoul

28:58.636 --> 29:00.138
Oh, I don't know, Mac.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.639
I think they ought to just run you

29:01.639 --> 29:02.640
for president or something.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.642
s. Oh, no thank

29:04.642 --> 29:07.145
I'd rather have this problem than his.

29:09.647 --> 29:12.150
(beeping)

29:48.686 --> 29:51.189
f. All right, watch yoursel

29:59.197 --> 30:01.699
(rapid beeping)

30:01.699 --> 30:04.702
ANNOUNCER: Bottom of the eleventh,
the score is still tied two-two.

30:04.702 --> 30:08.206
? Hey, Tim, what's happening
with t he disposal chamber

30:09.207 --> 30:11.209
Well, this is strange.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.211
The manual override's activated.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.213
I can't shut it down from here.

30:17.715 --> 30:20.218
(rapid beeping)

30:20.218 --> 30:21.219
(electrical sizzling)

30:29.227 --> 30:31.729
(hissing)

30:32.730 --> 30:34.732
! Shut it, quick

30:41.739 --> 30:42.240
Mac!

30:42.240 --> 30:44.742
Amy!

30:46.244 --> 30:49.747
I-I-I just heard o
n the phone that...

30:49.747 --> 30:51.249
What are you...?

30:51.249 --> 30:54.252
Uh, I mean, who's in the...?

30:54.252 --> 30:56.754
Wha-Wha-What 's
going on her e? Tim...

30:56.754 --> 30:58.756
it's a long story.

30:58.756 --> 31:02.260
It's just nice to know
we have time to tell it.

31:02.260 --> 31:05.263
Let's go. Come on.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.767
TIM: Well, I still think
you're suiting up for nothing.

31:09.767 --> 31:13.271
MacGYVER: Well, maybe, but I'm
convinced the uranium is still here.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.773
This kind of stuff just doesn't
happen in Westport Beach.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.276
Read the report, Tim. It's happening.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.778
That door didn't close
on us by accident.

31:21.779 --> 31:25.283
So... what do we do?

31:25.283 --> 31:27.785
You call the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, get them down here

31:27.785 --> 31:29.287
nd along with the
police . We'll try and fi

31:29.787 --> 31:30.788
that missing uranium.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.790
It should make a heck
of a press release, eh?

31:33.291 --> 31:35.293
Just like our college days, huh?

31:35.293 --> 31:37.295
Never a dull moment with MacGyver.

31:43.301 --> 31:47.805
He does a lot of that--
thinking about the past.

31:47.805 --> 31:49.307
Like me.

31:49.307 --> 31:53.811
Mac, this film badge
reacts to radiation.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.814
ck. If you're near anything
hot, it starts to turn bla

31:57.315 --> 32:00.818
And when it's all black...
they give you a new one?

32:00.818 --> 32:04.822
When it's all black,
they give you a coffin.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.827
Oh.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.830
Good.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.332
Come on.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.337
c. I don't know wha t you
expect to find in here, Ma

32:19.337 --> 32:21.339
Jerry and I checke d every container

32:21.339 --> 32:22.340
against the records.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.342
There aren't any extras.

32:24.342 --> 32:27.845
Well, this is the only place
high-grade could be kept, right?

32:27.845 --> 32:30.848
de Of course-- the al
arm system would explo

32:30.848 --> 32:32.850
if any high-level radioactive material

32:32.850 --> 32:36.354
got anywhere but here
or the reactor itself.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.856
Well...

32:38.856 --> 32:41.859
if I was going to hi
de high-grade uranium,

32:41.859 --> 32:44.362
I'd put it in with a
bunch of other high-grade,

32:44.362 --> 32:47.865
so you couldn't sort out the readings.

32:47.865 --> 32:51.369
Maybe you guys just overlooked one.

32:59.377 --> 33:01.379
Mac, that's filled with concrete.

33:01.879 --> 33:04.382
We use it as a sign post.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.384
bet I'd be willing to

33:06.384 --> 33:09.387
. this is filled with a
lot more than just concrete

33:09.887 --> 33:11.389
(detector crackles rapidly)

33:11.889 --> 33:12.890
Take a listen.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.893
(detector crackles rapidly)

33:17.895 --> 33:18.896
You were right, Mac.

33:18.896 --> 33:20.398
, So far

33:20.398 --> 33:21.399
so good.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.400
All right.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.402
Now we have some evidence.

33:24.902 --> 33:27.405
Step two is finding
out who put it there.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.915
Hi, Tim.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.418
You don't look very surprised, Mac.

33:40.418 --> 33:41.419
No...

33:41.919 --> 33:45.423
more disappointed than anything.

33:45.423 --> 33:47.925
But it all adds up, I guess.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.927
Had to be somebody
with run of the plant,

33:49.927 --> 33:51.929
somebody who knew how to handle

33:51.929 --> 33:52.930
radioactive material.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.932
Tim, I can't believe this.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.436
We grew up together,
and you tried to kill me?

33:58.436 --> 33:59.437
And you killed Bonnie?

33:59.937 --> 34:01.439
I never killed anybody.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.941
I never expected anybody to die.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.943
I didn't want this to happen.

34:06.444 --> 34:07.945
Put the gun down, Tim.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.947
No.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.449
No, it... it's t oo late for that

34:12.449 --> 34:13.951
now.

34:13.951 --> 34:16.954
I... I have to lock you up...

34:17.455 --> 34:18.456
both of you.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.956
I don't think either one of us wants

34:19.956 --> 34:21.458
ow. to be lock ed up right n

34:21.458 --> 34:22.960
There's too much at stake.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.464
I can't help that. I'm in
too deep now to get out.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.472
my. Come on, A

34:35.973 --> 34:37.475
. TIM: I'll shoot

34:37.975 --> 34:39.476
I mean it, Mac.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.482
so. No, I don't think

34:44.482 --> 34:46.984
Tim, I don't know how you
got involved in all this,

34:46.984 --> 34:48.985
ide but somewhere along
the line , you had to dec

34:48.985 --> 34:51.489
t. whether you're going
to be a killer or no

34:51.489 --> 34:54.992
You're going to have to
live with that decision.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.507
MacGyver!

35:09.507 --> 35:12.009
I'm warning you!

35:12.009 --> 35:14.011
WEXLER: MacGyver, stop!

35:14.512 --> 35:18.516
Mac, just how well do you read people?

35:18.516 --> 35:21.519
I'm taking the final exam right now.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.525
WEXLER: MacGyver, I'll shoot!

35:29.026 --> 35:32.530
MacGyver!

35:40.037 --> 35:41.539
(sobbing)

35:45.543 --> 35:46.544
on Kyle, key the re d line to Washingt

35:47.044 --> 35:48.045
and call the police.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.046
We've got...

35:49.046 --> 35:50.548
Kyle?

35:50.548 --> 35:53.050
Afraid he can't do that, Amy.

35:55.553 --> 35:59.056
Well, the other conspirator.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.057
e? Or are there mor

36:00.558 --> 36:02.059
Just the customers we're
going to meet in Canada.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.563
30 kilos bring in a
pretty hefty price, Chief?

36:06.063 --> 36:07.064
$50 million.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.566
AMY: That'sifyou deliver.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.067
Not if... when.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.569
. For God's sakes, Train

36:11.569 --> 36:13.070
ium You're selling eno
ugh weapons-grade uran

36:13.070 --> 36:14.572
. to make a nuclear bomb

36:14.572 --> 36:16.073
TRAIN: What happens to
it after I deliver it

36:16.073 --> 36:17.074
is no concern of mine.

36:17.575 --> 36:19.076
And you're not going to care, either.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.579
Train, no! Listen.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.080
There's been enough killing already.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.082
We-we can tie them up.

36:25.082 --> 36:26.584
Leave them behind.

36:26.584 --> 36:27.585
If we let them live,

36:28.085 --> 36:29.587
our face will be on the front desk

36:29.587 --> 36:32.089
of every law enforcement
organization in the world.

36:32.089 --> 36:34.592
(grunting): No!

36:34.592 --> 36:36.594
(gunshot)

36:41.599 --> 36:44.101
COMPUTER VOICE: Pressure overload.

36:44.101 --> 36:47.104
Pressure overload. Relieve manually.

36:47.104 --> 36:49.106
Mac, he shorted out
the monitor circuits.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.608
The reactor's going out of control!

36:51.108 --> 36:51.609
What does that mean?

36:52.109 --> 36:53.611
Meltdown!

36:53.611 --> 36:55.112
Oh, my God.

37:05.623 --> 37:09.126
(alarm blaring)

37:12.129 --> 37:14.131
Tim, can we stop it?

37:14.131 --> 37:16.634
I don't know.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.135
The board's half wrecked.

37:18.636 --> 37:22.139
When that reactor temperature
hits critical, we're...

37:22.139 --> 37:23.641
You know a meltdown won't fry

37:23.641 --> 37:25.142
just everybody here in the plant.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.644
We're talking about the contamination

37:26.644 --> 37:28.145
e. of half the stat

37:28.145 --> 37:29.146
COMPUTER VOICE: Cooling system failure.

37:29.146 --> 37:31.649
Commence evacuation procedure.

37:31.649 --> 37:35.152
(alarm blaring)

37:42.660 --> 37:44.662
AMY: It's heating up fast.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.163
COMPUTER VOICE: Procedure
Red. Procedure Red.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.164
Commence evacuation.

37:47.665 --> 37:48.666
You got to get out of here.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.668
There's nothing more I can do.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.670
Tim, make the call to the NRC first.

37:52.670 --> 37:55.172
We might still be able to
get a couple miles of away

37:55.172 --> 37:56.674
before the reactor goes.

37:56.674 --> 37:57.675
Just make the call and go.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.177
? And what about you

38:00.177 --> 38:01.178
Check me on this.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.681
We've got a reactor
that's heating up fast.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.182
No coolant getting in, right?

38:05.683 --> 38:06.684
That's it.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.686
In about 12 minutes, it's going to blow.

38:08.686 --> 38:11.188
What about the high
pressure injection system?

38:11.188 --> 38:13.190
It's operative.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.192
But there's nothing
getting into the reactor.

38:15.693 --> 38:16.694
There's a blockage.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.195
That's what I figure.

38:18.696 --> 38:22.199
So, if I can open it manually,
we're home free, right?

38:22.199 --> 38:23.701
Mac, no--
it'll kill you!

38:24.201 --> 38:25.703
No way!

38:25.703 --> 38:27.204
I haven't paid my taxes yet.

38:29.206 --> 38:32.710
Nuclear Processing Corporation,
Westport Beach plant.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.713
We have an incident.

38:36.213 --> 38:40.217
I repeat, we have an incident.

38:49.226 --> 38:52.730
MacGYVER: A Marine sergeant
once started a charge

38:52.730 --> 38:54.231
by yelling at his men,

38:54.732 --> 38:57.735
"Come on, you want to live forever?"

38:57.735 --> 38:59.737
Now, I used to think

38:59.737 --> 39:02.239
that was about the
guttiest thing ever said.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.241
But of course, the older you get,

39:04.742 --> 39:06.243
the more nervous you get.

39:06.243 --> 39:08.746
And I was getting.

39:09.246 --> 39:12.249
. We need to do a
high-pressur e bleed and feed

39:12.249 --> 39:14.251
We get the coola nt pressure up,

39:14.251 --> 39:17.755
d, and if MacGyver could
unblock that reactor fee

39:17.755 --> 39:19.256
then she shoul d cool down.

39:19.256 --> 39:20.257
I had the theory,

39:20.257 --> 39:22.760
but I'm a long way out of practice.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.762
Pressure's coming up.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.263
Time's running out.

39:35.773 --> 39:37.775
(gunshot)

39:50.287 --> 39:51.789
AMY: It's on automatic.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.791
It just needs flow regulation.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.293
I can handle this.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.795
But I need you.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.297
You know, um...

40:00.798 --> 40:04.802
chances are we, we might not make it.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.304
Look, it's worth trying.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.306
. See you around

40:23.320 --> 40:25.322
You can't run forever, MacGyver.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.324
MacGYVER: Train, are you crazy?

40:27.324 --> 40:29.827
We got a runaway reactor
to worry about here.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.328
TRAIN: That's wha t I'm trying

40:31.328 --> 40:32.329
to help you with.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.331
Stop all that worrying.

40:34.331 --> 40:36.333
MacGYVER: Isn't 30 kilos
of nuclear explosive

40:36.333 --> 40:38.335
enough for you?

40:38.335 --> 40:40.337
My God, it's enough
to level a whole city,

40:40.337 --> 40:42.840
enough to kill a quarter
of a million people!

40:42.840 --> 40:45.843
Nobody says that's what
they're going to do with it!

40:45.843 --> 40:46.844
MacGYVER: Yeah, right!

40:47.344 --> 40:48.846
Who are you trying to kid?

40:48.846 --> 40:50.347
Besides yourself?

40:50.347 --> 40:52.850
It's more money than
you could ever dream of--

40:52.850 --> 40:53.851
that's what counts.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.352
And the meltdown.. . (laughs)

40:56.854 --> 40:58.355
...that'll cover all the traces.

41:00.357 --> 41:01.859
(grunting, then gunshot)

41:08.365 --> 41:09.867
(groaning)

41:12.369 --> 41:13.871
Oh, God!

41:15.873 --> 41:18.876
What are you... what are you looking at?

41:18.876 --> 41:21.378
AMY: Your badge--
it's black.

41:21.378 --> 41:22.379
Ed, you've been hit

41:22.880 --> 41:25.382
with a major dose of
radioactive material.

41:25.883 --> 41:26.884
You're contaminated.

41:27.384 --> 41:30.387
MacGYVER: Put him in washdown.

41:30.888 --> 41:31.889
do. That's all we can

41:37.895 --> 41:38.896
TRAIN: Hurry up!

41:38.896 --> 41:40.898
Get me to the shower!

41:40.898 --> 41:43.901
(rapid beeping)

41:45.402 --> 41:46.904
e. Kyle, get out of her

41:47.404 --> 41:48.906
. There's nothin g you can do now

41:48.906 --> 41:50.908
What about you?

41:50.908 --> 41:52.910
me. It's too late for

41:52.910 --> 41:54.912
te. Way too la

41:54.912 --> 41:56.413
Okay, but...

42:07.925 --> 42:08.926
AMY: I'm going with you.

42:08.926 --> 42:10.928
Look, Mac, there's
washdown water up there,

42:10.928 --> 42:12.930
and you are going to need it to survive.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.937
MacGYVER: What about the high
pressure injection system?

42:19.937 --> 42:21.438
ne. It's on li

42:21.438 --> 42:23.440
Tim's standing by in the control room.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.442
ac. Looks like you pas
sed that final exam, M

42:25.442 --> 42:28.445
Yeah, so did Tim.

42:28.445 --> 42:29.446
I know.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.464
AMY: Something wrong?

42:47.464 --> 42:50.467
MacGYVER: Yeah. I hate heights.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.970
AMY: Oh, I forgot that.

42:52.970 --> 42:55.472
MacGYVER: And I thought
you remembered everything.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.502
Amy, give me some water!

43:39.016 --> 43:41.018
AMY: Is it moving?

43:41.018 --> 43:44.021
It's stuck!

43:49.026 --> 43:51.528
MacGYV ER: Damn!

43:51.528 --> 43:53.530
Oh, no!

43:55.032 --> 43:58.035
You'll never get it
off without that wrench!

44:04.041 --> 44:06.043
Amy, give me Train's gun!

44:17.054 --> 44:20.057
Please! Come on!

44:23.060 --> 44:24.061
More water, Amy!

44:24.061 --> 44:26.063
MacGYVER: I hate heights,

44:26.063 --> 44:29.566
and I despise guns.

44:29.566 --> 44:33.570
So, how the hell did
I get myself up here?

44:37.574 --> 44:39.076
Come on, please...

44:43.580 --> 44:45.082
Do it, Mac!

44:51.588 --> 44:53.090
MacGYVER: Hot damn!

44:53.090 --> 44:54.591
There she blows!

44:54.591 --> 44:57.594
First time in my life
I've ever been happy

44:57.594 --> 44:59.096
to have my hands on a gun!

45:04.601 --> 45:06.103
Yeah!

45:06.103 --> 45:07.604
We did it! Okay!

45:07.604 --> 45:09.606
Oh, we did do it!

45:10.107 --> 45:11.608
Oh, yeah!

45:18.615 --> 45:23.120
(rapid beeping steadily slowing down)

45:45.142 --> 45:47.144
A lot of strong memories
you've stirred up

45:47.144 --> 45:49.146
here in Westport Beach, Mr. MacGyver.

45:49.146 --> 45:51.648
Well, you've kind of conjured a couple

45:52.149 --> 45:55.152
that I'll be taking home
myself... Miss Austin.

45:57.154 --> 46:01.158
me. And I'll be hanging on
to them for quite some ti

46:01.158 --> 46:02.659
You know, sometimes I wish

46:02.659 --> 46:04.661
we could find a way back
to that crossroad, Mac.

46:05.162 --> 46:08.665
d? Yeah? What do you think we'd fin

46:08.665 --> 46:10.667
Just what
we have--

46:10.667 --> 46:12.169
our friendship.

46:14.171 --> 46:15.172
Did you ever wonder

46:15.172 --> 46:17.674
how we kept hold of
that through everything?

46:17.674 --> 46:20.677
y. Well, that's eas

46:21.178 --> 46:22.679
It's how we started.

46:38.695 --> 46:41.198
(engine starting)

47:05.956 --> 47:11.728
(theme music playing)
