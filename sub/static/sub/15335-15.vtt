OF YOUR FAMILY WHEN YOU
SLEPT WITH ME, MACK.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.992
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

43:47.025 --> 43:47.726
JUST THIS TIME,

43:47.759 --> 43:50.495
ONE TIME.
I PROMISE NEVER AGAIN.

43:50.528 --> 43:53.098
I'M BEGGING YOU.
ONE NIGHT.

43:53.131 --> 43:54.632
I'LL TELL TIFFY AND
THE REST OF THE WIVES.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.869
YEAH, YOU DO THAT, YOU'LL
LOSE THE ONLY SUPPORT
SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE.

43:57.903 --> 43:59.004
VENGEANCE AIN'T
A MARKETABLE COMMODITY.

43:59.037 --> 44:02.273
IT'S NOT? WELL,
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
SELL FOR A LIVING?

44:02.307 --> 44:04.075
GET OUT.

44:06.011 --> 44:09.047
NOT GOING
UNTIL YOU KISS ME.

44:12.818 --> 44:14.853
YES, YOU ARE.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.556
MACK, PLEASE.
