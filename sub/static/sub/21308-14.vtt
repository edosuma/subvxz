MARCO: Hey Star!

01:05.880 --> 01:07.040
- Ow!

01:07.040 --> 01:09.750
Marco! What did I
tell you about...

01:09.750 --> 01:11.540
Wait... Marco!

01:11.540 --> 01:12.540
Hi.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.830
Oh, my goodness!

01:13.830 --> 01:16.000
It's so good to see you.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.330
Um, what are you doing here?

01:18.330 --> 01:22.330
I missed it here,
so, I decided to come back
permanently.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.620
- TOM: ♪ Burrito, burrito ♪

01:25.620 --> 01:27.330

- Tom!

01:29.420 --> 01:30.830
- GUARD: Intruder!

01:30.830 --> 01:32.330
KNIGHTS: Hup, hup, hup.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.290
Uh, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

01:34.290 --> 01:36.830
Guys, guys, hey guys,
it's all right. It's just Marco.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.080
I'm not an intruder.
King River said
I could be a knight.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.000
See?
I got the cape and everything.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.960
- Look, he's got a cape.

01:57.830 --> 02:01.830
Ugh, River.
I'm so confused here.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.960
You told Marco
he could be a knight?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.460
Well, uh, yeah.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.290
I never actually thought
we'd see him again. Ha ha!

02:10.290 --> 02:13.710
I'm sorry, Marco, but I'm afraid
that's not how it works.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.830
But King River
gave me a knight's cape.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.420
M for Mewni.

02:17.420 --> 02:20.420
No, my boy,
that's my meat blanket.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.420
- Yes.

02:22.420 --> 02:25.830
- I also have a cheese doily.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.000
But I wore this thing
every day.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.750
For weeks. Weeks...

02:30.750 --> 02:32.330
I'm sorry, Marco,

02:32.330 --> 02:34.460
but becoming a knight
is no easy task.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.750
Yes. It takes years
of intense training, dear.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.420
Yeah.
Years of intense training.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.830
- He hasn't even been a squire.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.710
Hey, I can do that.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.420
River, are any of our knights
in need of a squire?

02:48.420 --> 02:51.040
Wait, I've got it.
How about we set him up

02:51.040 --> 02:52.710
with Sir Pop Lock and Dropeth?
Hmm?

02:52.710 --> 02:54.460
That old scamp!

02:54.460 --> 02:58.040
Um, actually,
he "pop, locked, and dropped".

02:58.040 --> 02:59.580
You mean...?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.420
Oh, my.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.250
Star, why don't you
have Marco stay with you?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.670
It will give you two
a chance to catch up

03:05.670 --> 03:07.790
while we figure this out.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.040
Wait, wait, wait.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.040
I know a knight
he can squire for.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.580
Man, Star. I'm sorry.

03:13.580 --> 03:16.080
I feel like I just
crash landed into your life.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.500
Well, we figured it out.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
Yeah... um, cool.

03:21.500 --> 03:26.380
Wow, heh. Check out
all these stairs.
Sure are a lot.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.500
So, what does Jackie
think about all this?

03:29.500 --> 03:35.960
Oh, well, she wasn't
really into it, but you know me.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.500
Ain't nobody telling me
what to do.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.500
That-that was a joke.

03:43.500 --> 03:48.460
Actually, yeah,
she-she broke up with me.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.960
Well,
I'm very sorry about that.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.000
So, are you and Tom--

03:55.000 --> 03:56.920
Yep!

03:56.920 --> 03:59.580
Oh, look, here's that door
we were walking to.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.580
Found you!

04:05.580 --> 04:09.580
Ah, here's our guy,
Sir Lavabo. Hi!

04:09.580 --> 04:12.040
Ah, princess.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.460
I will be with you shortly.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.960
I have a job to finish.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.620
There. Every sock in the kingdom
now has its mate.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.750
How may I be of service?

04:21.750 --> 04:25.000
Well, I...
I got you a squire.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.500
My own squire?

04:28.500 --> 04:29.960
What do you call him?

04:29.960 --> 04:32.670
- Marco Diaz.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.960
I'm squiring
for the laundry guy?

04:34.960 --> 04:38.580
Yeah. This is Sir Lavabo.
He's super cool.

04:38.580 --> 04:41.120
But I'd be way down here
in the basement.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.580
Actually, sub-basement.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.080
So moody.
You're gonna love it.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.790
Yeah, but, just the same,

04:48.790 --> 04:51.670
how about you princess me up
something a little closer,

04:51.670 --> 04:54.620
like, say,
something in the castle?

04:54.620 --> 04:57.000
Marco, just 'cause
I'm a princess

04:57.000 --> 04:58.540
doesn't mean
I can do anything I want.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, but if I'm
all the way down here,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.080
we're never even
gonna see each other.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.670
You don't appreciate
anything I do!

05:06.670 --> 05:10.620
Star, wait. I didn't mean...

05:10.620 --> 05:14.330
Marco Diaz, are you ready
for your first quest?

05:14.330 --> 05:16.830
Yeah... sure.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.120
What are we doing?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.880
You must empty
the lint catcher.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.830
"Oh, hey Star!"

05:23.830 --> 05:25.080
"I just showed up
out of nowhere."

05:25.080 --> 05:26.460
"Why don't you give me
a job to do?"

05:26.460 --> 05:28.080
Okay, Marco, here's a job.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.920
"No, not that job!
Another job

05:34.420 --> 05:35.420
Hello.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.620
Eclypsa.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.830
They're giving you
some outdoor time.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.120
That's great.

05:40.120 --> 05:44.000
I know.
And real dragon chains,too.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.040
They make a lady
feel so free.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.170
Oh, yeah, that's, uh,
that's really awesome.

05:50.170 --> 05:53.040
Can I sit?
Sit, like, right there?

05:55.540 --> 05:57.210
Thanks.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.210
Here, take a load off.
Feed the birds.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.040
Always makes me feel better.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.120
I don't get how some people
think it's okay

06:05.120 --> 06:07.000
to just drop into your life

06:07.000 --> 06:09.500
without so much
as a head's up.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.290
You know what I'm saying?

06:11.290 --> 06:13.080
And then you try
to help him out,

06:13.080 --> 06:16.290
no appreciation.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.500
So, what's his name?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.120
Huh

06:20.120 --> 06:21.670
No, no, no, no, no,
it's not like that.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.120
Well, well, not anymore.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.120
- It's just Marco.
- Well, Marco.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.170
So, that's it.

06:27.170 --> 06:28.500
Marco thinks that

06:28.500 --> 06:30.330
just because
I'm a princess,

06:30.330 --> 06:33.210
I can get him
whatever job he wants.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.500
Well, can't you?

06:36.500 --> 06:40.880
No... yes.
But that's not the point.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.750
Well, now that he's here,
do you want him to stay?

06:44.750 --> 06:48.120
Uh, yeah... no.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.790
Ugh, I don't know.
Doesn't matter anyway.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.880
I already made him
a laundry squire.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.170
He's squiring
for the knight of the wash?

06:58.170 --> 07:01.250
Well, then your problem
will take care of itself, dear.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.880
What's that supposed to mean?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.830
No squire has ever survived

07:04.830 --> 07:06.710
more than a day
in the laundry room.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.330
It's the most dangerous place
in the castle.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.540
Marco! I got to go.

07:11.540 --> 07:12.830
Thanks for the popcorn.

07:12.830 --> 07:15.330
That wasn't popcorn.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.790
Lavabo, where's Marco?

07:16.790 --> 07:18.210
On his first quest,

07:18.210 --> 07:20.210
cleaning out the lint catcher,
mi' lady.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.210
Oh, no.
Sparkle slushie juice blast!

07:25.210 --> 07:26.330
Wait, princess!

07:28.210 --> 07:30.290
Marco?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.210
Whoa!

07:38.290 --> 07:40.210
That was weird.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.960
Marco! There you are.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.830
No, don't.
You're gonna wake it up.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.250
- No, I said.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.380
Don't. You're gonna wake it up.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.920
What?

07:54.920 --> 07:58.000
I said,
you're going to wake it up.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.290
- Whoa!
- Ugh!

08:10.290 --> 08:14.460
Whoa! Aah!

08:14.460 --> 08:15.710
Aah!

08:16.790 --> 08:18.420
Rolling thunder lightning blast!

08:18.420 --> 08:20.000
Aah!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
No!

08:26.880 --> 08:27.790
Marco!

08:29.210 --> 08:31.620
Huh?

08:33.830 --> 08:35.380
Marco, are you okay?

08:35.380 --> 08:37.000
We gotta get
that fan moving.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.880
Hiya!

08:46.080 --> 08:47.420
It won't budge!

08:47.420 --> 08:48.790
Wiggle harder!

08:50.210 --> 08:51.710
I'm coming, Marco.

08:51.710 --> 08:54.040
- Ha, gotcha!
- Whoa!

09:02.790 --> 09:04.540
Fantastic exit beam!

09:04.540 --> 09:06.290
- Aah!
- Aah!

09:07.670 --> 09:09.880
LAVABO:
Bravo!

09:09.880 --> 09:11.290
Fantastique!

09:11.290 --> 09:14.670
Only one other squire
has survived the lint catcher.

09:14.670 --> 09:15.920
Me!

09:15.920 --> 09:19.290
Marco Diaz, you will make
a fine squire

09:19.290 --> 09:21.080
for the knights of the wash.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.330
Great.

09:22.330 --> 09:24.290
Thanks, I guess.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.000
Uh, Lavabo, can you
give us a sec?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.500
I need to talk
to Marco alone.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
As you wish, Princess.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.500
Long live the wash.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.000
Okay, listen, Marco.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.380
Here's the thing.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.420
A lot has changed
in my life since you left.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.580
It's complicated,
but I finally figured out

09:41.580 --> 09:44.920
that I just need to be
the best princess I can now.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.120
And with you here
it's really hard to--

09:48.120 --> 09:50.170
Yeah, yeah.
I totally get it.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.960
It was a crazy bad idea
for me to do this

09:51.960 --> 09:53.500
without giving you
a heads up.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.710
I'll go back to Earth.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.830
That's not what I meant.

09:57.830 --> 10:02.290
Okay, can I, uh,
take my hands
off my face, please?

10:02.290 --> 10:05.380
I feel like I'm gonna
run into something.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.790
Okay, stop.

10:06.790 --> 10:08.380
This is the place.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.670
Sparkle glitter bomb expand.

10:13.420 --> 10:14.670
Okay, you can look now.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.420
Wow.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.540
Is that...

10:20.540 --> 10:22.290
What?

10:22.290 --> 10:23.920
No way!

10:23.920 --> 10:25.920
I can't believe it!

10:26.880 --> 10:30.120
My room!

10:30.120 --> 10:32.170
All my stuff!

10:32.170 --> 10:33.330
My galactic kung fu doll.

10:33.330 --> 10:36.040
This is so great!

10:36.040 --> 10:37.330
Marco, kneel.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.380
Uh, what?

10:39.380 --> 10:40.420
Marco, sit.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.500
What are

10:44.500 --> 10:46.290
Head down, please.

10:47.710 --> 10:50.120
I hereby declare that you,

10:50.120 --> 10:53.000
Marco Ubaldo Diaz,
shall henceforth

10:53.000 --> 10:56.420
be my royal squire,
to stay by my side

10:56.420 --> 10:58.250
in times of peace
or danger,

10:58.250 --> 11:01.330
as my most trusted
confidant and advisor.

11:01.330 --> 11:04.460
To go clubbing with me
even when he's too tired,

11:04.460 --> 11:06.960
to share his
late night nachos,

11:06.960 --> 11:11.420
but most importantly
to be my very best friend

11:11.420 --> 11:13.580
so long as we both
shall live.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.540
Amen.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.380
Do you accept?

11:16.380 --> 11:18.380
I do.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.000
Wait, do princesses
even have squires?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.290
I'm a princess.
I can do what I want.
