<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.450
Do you know Commander Mackenzie?

00:04.450 --> 00:06.580
He has a daughter.
Her name is Agnes.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.280
Protect her, please.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.350
Just love her for me.
I promise.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.630
Hannah would attend

00:11.630 --> 00:13.330
a school for domestic arts.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.100
The one in her district
is in Brookline,

00:15.100 --> 00:16.680
by the reservoir.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.490
We need to look
at starting a series

00:18.490 --> 00:19.940
of district-wide Salvagings.

00:19.940 --> 00:21.470
One last measured push

00:21.470 --> 00:23.740
should roll up the last
of the insurgent strongholds.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.430
I've seen a lot
of these reunions

00:25.430 --> 00:27.230
and it's not always
a storybook ending.

00:27.230 --> 00:28.620
I don't want to make
things awkward for you.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.210
It is awkward.

00:30.210 --> 00:32.250
But who cares?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.740
Waterford asked to borrow you.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.470
He's trying to force
the Canadians to talk

00:35.470 --> 00:37.690
about repatriating his daughter.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.160
You have to understand that

00:39.160 --> 00:42.130
seeing her changed
everything for me.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.400
Seeing her changed <i>you</i>...

00:44.400 --> 00:46.960
it didn't change this place.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.080
Here's to your bright future.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.640
Perhaps here
in D. C.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.670
You know this is all
gonna be over soon.

00:51.670 --> 00:52.750
You're gonna get
to go back home,

00:52.750 --> 00:53.840
and we're gonna stay here.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.670
And you and I will
finally be free

00:55.670 --> 00:56.720
of one another.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.240
You will never be free of me

00:58.240 --> 01:00.610
until both my children are safe.

01:00.610 --> 01:02.260
I should have put
a ring in your mouth

01:02.260 --> 01:03.600
the day that we met.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.230
I should have let you burn

01:05.230 --> 01:06.730
when I had the chance.

Places!

01:53.730 --> 01:55.430
By His hand.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.070
By His hand.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.150
Heave!

02:03.240 --> 02:04.650
Heave!

02:07.940 --> 02:09.600
Heave!

02:23.060 --> 02:26.130
The Lord is calling on you, girls.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.170
He is depending on you

02:29.170 --> 02:31.760
to be His holy instrument.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.890
His charge is surely difficult,

02:34.890 --> 02:37.110
but he has special blessings

02:37.110 --> 02:38.700
for the strong

02:38.700 --> 02:41.350
and faithful among us.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.960
Drop the ropes.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.860
Let's go.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.000
Disperse.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.920
Come on. I'm freezing.

03:08.910 --> 03:10.050
I hear the woman

03:10.050 --> 03:12.100
mistreated her child.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.260
Let him just cry
for hours and hours,

03:14.260 --> 03:15.550
poor thing.

03:15.550 --> 03:18.250
Yeah, it's a great reason
to hang someone.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.820
It certainly is.

03:20.820 --> 03:21.850
His winnowing fork

03:21.850 --> 03:24.120
is merciful and necessary.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.660
Clearing away the rotted...

03:25.660 --> 03:27.390
chaff so the good can take root.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.040
What's wrong?

03:31.040 --> 03:32.250
Nothing, praise be.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.080
I'm fine.

03:36.970 --> 03:38.870
All right.
Just breathe through it.

03:38.870 --> 03:39.870
Come on.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.700
In through the nose.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.930
Out through the mouth.

03:46.580 --> 03:47.800
There you go.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.660
Thank you.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.680
Yeah.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.740
I've always
loved being with child.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.030
This time is...

04:02.030 --> 04:03.850
difficult.

04:03.850 --> 04:07.060
Did you tell the doctor?

04:07.060 --> 04:09.500
He said everything's normal.

04:12.030 --> 04:14.060
I don't know what's
wrong with me, I...

04:15.770 --> 04:17.089
I wish it was over.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.680
When I was first
pregnant with Nichole,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.020
I was...

04:26.020 --> 04:27.670
pretty scared.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.660
I had some thoughts that

04:31.660 --> 04:34.030
I would be...

04:34.030 --> 04:36.250
ashamed to admit now.

04:37.930 --> 04:40.390
Well, I don't have
any "thoughts."

04:41.400 --> 04:42.780
My child is a blessing.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.090
Uh-huh.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.250
<i>Notice of change.</i>

04:49.250 --> 04:50.870
<i>Bee tokens are now usable</i>

04:50.870 --> 04:53.210
<i>for both honey and bee pollen.</i>

04:53.210 --> 04:55.050
<i>Bee pollen no longer requires</i>

04:55.050 --> 04:56.450
<i>a separate token.</i>

04:59.880 --> 05:01.890
Ofjoseph, you walked
right by the flour.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.420
Blessed be the fruit.

05:07.420 --> 05:08.930
May the Lord open.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.630
I saw two other veils yesterday.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.660
I hear they're
popping up all over.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.860
We should salute their devotion.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.270
Right.
You do that.

05:16.270 --> 05:18.300
Ofjoseph, they finally
got a shipment

05:18.300 --> 05:19.810
of that fruit cocktail
you've been looking for.

05:19.810 --> 05:21.440
I'll show you.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.810
I love fruit cocktail.

05:22.810 --> 05:24.690
Actually, Ofmatthew,

05:24.690 --> 05:26.710
could you help me
pick some avocados?

05:26.710 --> 05:28.150
I can never pick a ripe one.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.900
I'm happy to help.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.980
Fruit cocktail, really?

05:33.980 --> 05:36.010
I'm crappy at improv.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.580
I'd hurry.

05:39.580 --> 05:40.670
It won't last long.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.700
<i>Last week of
wheat bread this season.</i>

05:43.700 --> 05:45.730
<i>Last week of wheat bread.</i>

05:47.050 --> 05:49.660
Thank you for coming.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.430
I didn't know if you'd
got my message.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.840
Mrs. Mackenzie
asked you to stop!

05:53.840 --> 05:55.970
I can't.
Could you?

05:55.970 --> 05:58.110
How's she doing?

05:58.110 --> 05:59.110
<i>Agnes</i>

05:59.110 --> 06:01.210
couldn't be happier.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.350
She's doing so well in school.

06:03.350 --> 06:05.790
A school that would cut off
her finger for reading.

06:10.750 --> 06:11.820
My Commander can get us out.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.660
All of us.

06:13.660 --> 06:15.320
You could be free.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.230
She's just a child!

06:21.230 --> 06:23.600
To put her in that kind
of danger is selfish!

06:23.600 --> 06:26.240
She should be
with her real parents.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.670
I'm not so sure.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.660
Then ask her.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.010
I won't put her
in that position!

06:31.010 --> 06:32.680
Then I'll ask her.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.710
You can't come
back to the house!

06:37.680 --> 06:39.030
Her school.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.680
In Brookline.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.500
I just came from
my fourth hanging this week.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.730
Do you think
it's gonna get better?

06:58.830 --> 07:00.400
Go to the gate.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.710
Guardian Parker, he's a friend.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.640
He's there today.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.410
He'll help you.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.860
Thank you for your patience.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.660
Just a few more
details to go over.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.680
What does all this have to do

07:26.680 --> 07:28.320
with protecting the baby?

07:28.320 --> 07:30.030
Gilead has provided us
with an account

07:30.030 --> 07:32.490
of Dr. Malek's
criminal activity.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.170
Criminal?

07:34.170 --> 07:35.870
In their opinion,

07:35.870 --> 07:37.330
yes.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.140
Last autumn,

07:40.140 --> 07:42.560
I understand you stole
a government vehicle?

07:46.020 --> 07:47.040
Yes.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.460
They say you drove recklessly,

07:48.460 --> 07:51.110
and intentionally
struck a guard.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.420
Yes.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.680
You ran him over?

08:05.860 --> 08:07.190
Yes.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.680
On the night of your escape,

08:16.680 --> 08:18.910
did you stab your supervisor?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
Aunt Lydia?

08:27.190 --> 08:28.410
Yes.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.200
And you stabbed her in the back?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.230
Yes.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.260
And then you threw
her down a staircase?

08:43.260 --> 08:44.870
Don't you know what
that monster did to her?

08:44.870 --> 08:47.680
- I do.
- Syl, please...

08:47.680 --> 08:49.210
I do.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.680
And I don't enjoy
asking these questions.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.550
Believe me.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.060
Dr. Malek,

08:58.060 --> 08:59.490
did you take any other actions

08:59.490 --> 09:02.530
that Gilead would see as criminal?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.070
Probably.

09:29.460 --> 09:32.850
You know I don't care
what you did there, right?

09:34.060 --> 09:36.290
You don't have to deal
with this on your own.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.690
I'm fine.

09:54.740 --> 09:57.260
I know you're not
<i>officially</i> looking,

09:57.260 --> 09:58.950
but...

09:58.950 --> 10:00.580
I think you both
could make a home

10:00.580 --> 10:02.520
here in D. C.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.670
I'm not even sure

10:03.670 --> 10:05.680
where my home is anymore.

10:08.030 --> 10:10.660
Let me show you something.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.450
This is one of the few,

10:26.450 --> 10:28.900
unrestored houses left.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.240
Just waiting
for the right owners.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.700
Ah.

10:41.090 --> 10:44.250
We can take all this stuff down.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.790
The light is beautiful.

10:51.070 --> 10:52.740
Who lived here before?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.070
I think they were Baptists?

11:23.460 --> 11:25.030
The master's next door.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.940
So you can hear everything.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.730
And the other rooms
already have bunk beds so,

11:30.730 --> 11:32.750
when the kids are older...

11:49.360 --> 11:51.580
I'll think about it.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.680
Let's go look at the master.

12:16.020 --> 12:17.690
Fred!

12:17.690 --> 12:19.870
George!

12:19.870 --> 12:21.690
Just got word.

12:21.690 --> 12:23.040
Canada's willing to talk about

12:23.040 --> 12:24.460
a general extradition treaty.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.930
Oh, that's great.

12:25.930 --> 12:27.440
Early days, but...

12:27.440 --> 12:29.670
you should be very encouraged.

12:29.670 --> 12:31.530
Well, my initiative
wouldn't have gotten very far

12:31.530 --> 12:33.870
without your support
and expertise.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.800
We make a good team.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.020
Extradition is
delicate business.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.680
It's gonna take time.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.880
Well, once Nichole's returned,

12:41.880 --> 12:44.440
we'd do our best to move
the others along quickly.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.370
So much leverage
comes from the child.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.680
With her back home...

12:57.460 --> 12:58.870
You want me to keep her there.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.870
Just for a bit.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.230
Fred.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.890
It's your vision that's
brought us to this point.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.480
In the end,
Gilead will know whom to credit.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.880
Think about it.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.870
- Where's the Commander?
- I don't know.

13:28.870 --> 13:31.230
In some Commander place
doing Commander things.

13:31.230 --> 13:33.030
I have to get to Brookline
by three o'clock

13:33.030 --> 13:35.160
to see my daughter.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.810
Good luck with that.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.470
I can't go alone as a Martha.

13:40.470 --> 13:41.750
Well, I'm not hauling my ass

13:41.750 --> 13:43.300
all the way to Brookline.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.310
Not with all the
Guardians out there.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.450
What if I take this up
to Mrs. Lawrence for you?

13:50.450 --> 13:51.900
Cool.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.540
Oh, thank you, dear.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.760
That's okay. I've got it.

14:17.070 --> 14:19.310
You can set the tea on the table.

14:19.310 --> 14:20.950
Mm-hm.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.150
It's a beautiful day.

14:24.150 --> 14:25.550
Would you mind if I opened
the curtains for you?

14:33.020 --> 14:35.160
Would you like to go for a walk?

14:35.160 --> 14:38.090
Joseph...
wouldn't like that.

14:38.090 --> 14:39.900
Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't mind,

14:39.900 --> 14:42.550
if he knew how
much you'd enjoy it.

14:44.130 --> 14:46.740
I really shouldn't.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.540
There's so many people...

14:49.540 --> 14:51.770
But I'll be right there
with you the whole time.

14:53.540 --> 14:56.250
I'll make sure nothing
happens to you, okay?

14:59.050 --> 15:00.350
Promise.

15:09.850 --> 15:11.870
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.070
Go get your coat.

15:52.470 --> 15:54.440
Praise be,
Mrs. Lawrence.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.500
I haven't seen you out in ages.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.710
Blessed day, Mrs. Putnam.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.300
I'm always asking Warren,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.710
why haven't the Lawrences
come over for supper?

16:02.710 --> 16:06.150
Ah, well, you know how
the Commander can be.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.280
Oh!

16:08.280 --> 16:11.190
Oh, she's gotten so big!

16:11.190 --> 16:12.940
Hi, Button.

16:12.940 --> 16:14.470
Oh.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.120
We thought you were gonna die.

16:17.190 --> 16:18.530
But you didn't.

16:18.530 --> 16:19.860
You didn't die.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.630
She's beautiful,
Mrs. Putnam.

16:21.630 --> 16:22.720
Thank you, Ofjoseph.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.650
It's nice to see you
getting along so well

16:25.650 --> 16:27.650
with your new mistress.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.030
That's a ripe Handmaid
you have there.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.680
I'm sure she'll give you
a healthy child in no time.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.610
She's such a pretty baby.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.520
Such a miracle.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.820
I'm so glad she didn't die.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.140
Mrs. Lawrence,

16:43.140 --> 16:45.740
don't you think
we should be going?

16:46.620 --> 16:49.320
Oh, yes.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.960
Have a lovely day,
Mrs. Putnam.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.600
You too.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.200
Mrs. Lawrence?

17:34.940 --> 17:36.660
It's hard...

17:36.660 --> 17:39.510
not to imagine
what my own daughter

17:39.510 --> 17:41.780
might have looked like.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.650
Or...

17:43.650 --> 17:45.660
little boy.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.880
You and the Commander
tried to have children?

17:52.880 --> 17:55.060
Before?

17:55.060 --> 17:57.360
I wanted to.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.240
He...

17:59.240 --> 18:02.000
he disagreed.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.870
I was teaching full-time but...

18:06.870 --> 18:09.910
it was a struggle.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.470
They were always

18:11.470 --> 18:14.620
adjusting my dosage.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.870
I wish we could've.

18:25.450 --> 18:27.230
Being a mother in Gilead

18:27.230 --> 18:29.260
must pose its own challenges.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.600
Maybe...

18:36.600 --> 18:38.630
maybe we did the right thing.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.880
Mrs. Lawrence,
I lied to you.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.870
My daughter's school
is in Brookline.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.450
Today may be my
only chance to see her.

18:57.450 --> 18:59.520
So...

19:04.860 --> 19:06.680
I'm sorry.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.640
I really am.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.830
I'll take you home if you want.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.660
No.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.340
Let's go.

19:22.340 --> 19:25.080
The T stop's only a block away.

19:27.050 --> 19:30.440
I think I'm keen
on an adventure.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.460
Okay.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.670
Canada needs to grow a pair

19:50.670 --> 19:52.870
and tell Gilead to fucking go to hell.

19:52.870 --> 19:54.460
You know, I think it's tricky.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.760
Diplomatically.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.240
Yeah, but Nichole is a refugee

19:57.240 --> 19:59.260
under their protection,
just like us.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.520
They need to protect her.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.310
They do.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.550
Do you miss your old job?

20:12.470 --> 20:14.770
Sometimes.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.170
I guess I miss
the people mostly.

20:20.170 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.910
So, okay.

20:28.910 --> 20:30.380
Before Syl,

20:30.380 --> 20:32.980
I'm guessing you were
you a Sommerville girl?

20:32.980 --> 20:34.450
Did you hit, like, Club Cafe?

20:34.450 --> 20:35.680
Machine?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.050
Me?
No.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.660
I, um, basically studied.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.460
I hit up club bio lab
most of the time.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.310
Uh, okay. Where'd...
Where'd you go?

20:45.310 --> 20:46.320
Harvard.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.700
Oh... I know a
few Harvard girls!

20:48.700 --> 20:50.370
Um... God, what's...

20:50.370 --> 20:52.030
Ah, oh!
Diane McKenna!

20:52.030 --> 20:54.220
She's brunette, uh...
law school?

20:54.220 --> 20:57.210
The law school
was kind of separate.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.870
Right.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.650
Um...

21:00.650 --> 21:01.860
Ooh!

21:01.860 --> 21:04.310
Erica Biers?

21:04.310 --> 21:05.700
Tina Sosa?

21:05.700 --> 21:06.730
Sorry.

21:06.730 --> 21:08.260
I went out with a firefighter

21:08.260 --> 21:10.000
from Charlestown for a while.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.040
Um...

21:11.040 --> 21:13.620
But she wasn't out
and she had a boyfriend.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.220
Uh, Pina Delvaglio?

21:15.220 --> 21:17.760
No, God.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.870
How can we not have
any gay in common?

21:19.870 --> 21:22.280
Jeez, I'm pretty sure
that this is the first time

21:22.280 --> 21:24.470
this has ever happened
in all of lesbian history.

21:24.470 --> 21:26.680
Oh, I met Syl and...

21:26.680 --> 21:29.070
that was it.

21:31.270 --> 21:33.280
I know the feeling.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.750
Oh, crap.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.240
Shit.
I gotta, um...

21:41.240 --> 21:42.580
I gotta go.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.660
Gonna go bird dog

21:43.660 --> 21:45.420
the Canadian Minister
of Border Security.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.760
"Bird dog?"

21:46.760 --> 21:48.240
Yeah,
it's like protesting but like,

21:48.240 --> 21:50.460
right up in their faces.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.090
Can I come?

22:00.540 --> 22:02.870
If you want to.
Sure.

22:05.110 --> 22:07.540
Minister!
Minister!

22:08.640 --> 22:10.230
Why has your department refused

22:10.230 --> 22:11.880
to declare Gilead refugees

22:11.880 --> 22:13.010
safe from deportation?

22:13.010 --> 22:15.020
The safety, safety of refugees
is our greatest concern.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.150
Canada's doors are
always open to those in need.

22:17.150 --> 22:18.950
Are you gonna talk to us?

22:18.950 --> 22:20.890
Stay on him!
Minister!

22:20.890 --> 22:22.990
Why are the
Swiss here? Huh?

22:22.990 --> 22:24.800
How can you even <i>consider</i>

22:24.800 --> 22:26.470
negotiating with Gilead?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.500
Answer the question!

22:27.500 --> 22:29.440
It's in the interests

22:29.440 --> 22:31.450
of all Canadians
and Canadian refugees

22:31.450 --> 22:33.340
that we keep peace
with all our neighbors.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.920
There is no peace with Gilead!

22:34.920 --> 22:37.170
Yeah.
Hey!

22:37.170 --> 22:38.870
Move back.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.520
Why won't you just <i>refuse</i> Gilead

22:40.520 --> 22:42.140
custody of Baby Nichole?

22:42.140 --> 22:44.790
Birth mother's already
surrendered her rights.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.800
She didn't surrender anything!

22:46.800 --> 22:48.680
June gave Nichole to me!

22:48.680 --> 22:50.580
She wanted her baby out of
that sick, twisted place,

22:50.580 --> 22:51.940
you fuck!

22:51.940 --> 22:53.170
Don't touch me!

22:53.170 --> 22:54.200
Yeah!

22:54.200 --> 22:55.850
I risked my life to get her out!

22:55.850 --> 22:58.130
- I did my part!
- Hey, get off of me!

22:58.130 --> 22:59.510
Now you do yours!

22:59.510 --> 23:00.680
You...
Fuck!

23:00.680 --> 23:02.830
Get the fuck off me!
Get off of me!

23:02.830 --> 23:04.890
Get your hands off me!

23:37.250 --> 23:39.650
Front gate clear.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.310
Any movement there?

23:53.030 --> 23:54.480
Guardian Parker?

23:56.040 --> 23:57.550
Sorry, ma'am,
Parker's not here today.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.820
Can I help you with something?

24:01.820 --> 24:03.050
Yes.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.800
I was promised
a tour of the grounds.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.230
I'm Commander Lawrence's wife.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.250
I'd be happy
to arrange that for you.

24:20.340 --> 24:22.470
All clear.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.260
Hannah.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.400
Hannah.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.290
Hannah.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.390
Baby?

25:39.390 --> 25:41.030
Hannah!

25:50.500 --> 25:52.140
Hannah.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.930
Hannah.

26:12.550 --> 26:14.770
Hi, baby.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.680
My baby girl.

26:21.430 --> 26:23.080
Hi.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.240
Miss!

26:44.240 --> 26:45.890
Miss!

26:48.090 --> 26:49.450
I was promised a tour

26:49.450 --> 26:50.530
- of the grounds!
- Ma'am!

26:50.530 --> 26:52.260
I need to see the children!

26:52.260 --> 26:53.260
I've already
explained this to you.

26:53.260 --> 26:54.430
Please show me the children!

26:54.430 --> 26:55.440
I can't have you like this

26:55.440 --> 26:56.460
in front of the children.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.480
You told me I could
see the grounds!

26:57.480 --> 26:58.500
Step back, Ma'am.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.510
- Eleanor?
- You left me.

26:59.510 --> 27:00.540
I'm so sorry.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.270
She won't stop
asking about the children!

27:02.270 --> 27:04.460
Why is she talking...
She's confused!

27:04.460 --> 27:06.510
She has health issues.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.780
I'm sorry.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.880
Do you want me to take you home?

27:12.880 --> 27:15.170
Yes.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.470
June.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.130
Please.

27:27.660 --> 27:28.680
Okay.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.540
Come on.

27:41.710 --> 27:43.350
Here we are.

27:46.850 --> 27:48.500
Just...

27:54.590 --> 27:56.590
Forgive me, Ofjoseph.

27:56.590 --> 27:58.030
I tried.

27:58.030 --> 28:00.560
I really tried.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.210
I want you to rest.

28:20.650 --> 28:21.890
Lie down.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.570
Lie down.

28:26.850 --> 28:28.890
Just rest, my love.

28:50.780 --> 28:52.280
I had no intention

28:52.280 --> 28:54.280
of putting her
in any danger, sir.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.570
No.

29:06.290 --> 29:08.330
You should've seen her out there.

29:09.460 --> 29:12.170
She came alive.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.170
You should have seen her.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.670
Thank you.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.780
I'm not late, am I?

29:38.780 --> 29:39.830
Never.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.830
How was the gallery?

29:45.030 --> 29:46.260
It was extraordinary

29:46.260 --> 29:47.660
to see all those pieces

29:47.660 --> 29:49.700
in such an intimate setting.

29:50.670 --> 29:51.680
And such a blessing

29:51.680 --> 29:53.050
that so many were recovered

29:53.050 --> 29:55.060
from the Art Institute.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.680
Do you remember
when we were there last?

30:00.680 --> 30:02.230
You skipped out

30:02.230 --> 30:04.450
on your cousin's baby shower.

30:04.450 --> 30:05.990
You skipped out too, remember?

30:05.990 --> 30:07.890
Fishing trip to Lake Michigan?

30:09.790 --> 30:11.660
Killing helpless creatures

30:11.660 --> 30:13.670
or looking at art with my wife.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.070
Not a hard decision.

30:18.430 --> 30:19.460
Speaking of creatures,

30:19.460 --> 30:21.470
this all looks delicious.

30:23.470 --> 30:24.660
Liv would never say anything

30:24.660 --> 30:26.170
but I know that she appreciates

30:26.170 --> 30:28.190
having a night off from us.

30:30.410 --> 30:32.620
The Winslows have
been very kind to us.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.350
Yes.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.730
And you've been so very patient.

30:50.470 --> 30:51.680
I know that we'll have a home

30:51.680 --> 30:53.710
of our own again someday.

30:57.110 --> 30:58.730
We will.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.110
All of us.

31:08.150 --> 31:10.580
I'm gonna bring
Nichole back, Serena.

31:11.650 --> 31:13.440
Just as soon as I can manage.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.000
What happened?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.230
I'm good at my job
is what happened.

31:20.230 --> 31:21.400
I was becoming afraid

31:21.400 --> 31:23.230
that it was more
politically expedient

31:23.230 --> 31:24.660
to have her stay in Canada.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.900
Well, that's what some believe.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.310
Not me.

31:34.210 --> 31:36.450
I... I don't have a timeline yet,

31:36.450 --> 31:38.390
so please don't push me for one.

31:38.390 --> 31:39.420
Of course.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.870
Thank you, Fred.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.900
Thank you.

32:02.860 --> 32:04.880
So, Luke will probably be cool.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.310
Uh, he might freak out.

32:08.310 --> 32:09.760
It's unclear.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.090
How 'bout Syl?

32:12.090 --> 32:14.100
I honestly have no idea.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.310
Well, um...

32:16.310 --> 32:17.960
you're a prison bitch now.
She might like that.

32:19.190 --> 32:20.870
Maybe.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.890
No, if Syl is mad,
she won't tell me.

32:22.890 --> 32:24.970
She's trying to give me space.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.020
Space.

32:32.670 --> 32:34.690
There's a lot she doesn't know.

32:38.310 --> 32:41.020
I killed a Wife.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.030
In the Colonies.

32:44.550 --> 32:46.570
I poisoned her.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.880
Okay.

32:57.260 --> 32:59.550
I'm not sorry.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.910
I killed a Commander.

33:09.470 --> 33:11.040
I didn't have to.
He was asleep.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.040
But I did it anyway.

33:15.450 --> 33:17.120
Look at what
they've turned us into.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.050
You killed anybody
since you've been out?

33:27.050 --> 33:29.290
No.
You?

33:29.290 --> 33:31.130
Nope.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.720
So I think we're good.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.870
Thank you.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.100
Thank you.
Happy news.

34:06.330 --> 34:07.900
- Fred!
- George!

34:07.900 --> 34:09.250
I have a group of skeptics

34:09.250 --> 34:10.469
waiting for you to charm them.

34:10.469 --> 34:13.050
Serena, so lovely.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.870
If you'd be so kind, that way.

34:14.870 --> 34:16.889
If you'd be so kind.

34:47.230 --> 34:49.440
Serena!
There you are.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.540
You look beautiful.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.510
Oh, hardly.

34:52.510 --> 34:54.030
But thank you.

34:54.030 --> 34:55.900
Come this way.

34:57.910 --> 34:59.260
Evelyn.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.880
Serena Joy, this is Evelyn.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.010
- Hello.
- Blessed evening.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.230
- Gabrielle.
- Blessed evening.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.030
- And Ticona.
- Blessed evening.

35:06.030 --> 35:08.220
Blessed evening.

35:08.220 --> 35:10.120
Well, the space looks amazing.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.230
Evelyn transformed it.

35:12.230 --> 35:13.490
Thank you.

35:13.490 --> 35:14.860
Although my Dennis will

35:14.860 --> 35:16.800
take all the credit.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.810
Isn't that what they all do?

35:23.270 --> 35:25.650
Every man
needs a safe space to strut

35:25.650 --> 35:27.210
for the other peacocks.

35:27.210 --> 35:28.660
That's why we have
our own peacocks

35:28.660 --> 35:30.810
to strut for us.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.220
Yes.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.090
Enjoy yourself, Serena.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.540
You're among friends.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.830
You look stunning.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.960
May I?

38:10.170 --> 38:12.280
What happened?

38:12.280 --> 38:14.110
The Mackenzies are gone.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.230
Gone where?

38:18.230 --> 38:19.240
I don't know.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.300
Not even my Commander knows.

38:22.950 --> 38:26.690
Why the long faces, girls?

38:26.690 --> 38:29.390
It's a glorious morning.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.030
Take a moment to abide

38:32.030 --> 38:35.020
in the sunlight of His grace.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.480
Today we purify

38:38.480 --> 38:42.840
that most grievous of sins...

38:42.840 --> 38:45.860
the endangerment of a sacred child.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.260
By a Martha,

39:03.260 --> 39:06.590
of all people.

39:06.590 --> 39:09.050
Conspiring against the child

39:09.050 --> 39:11.050
she was trusted

39:11.050 --> 39:13.820
to protect.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.720
No sin is more vile.

39:21.380 --> 39:22.720
Places.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.550
By His hand.

39:30.550 --> 39:32.570
By His hand.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.860
Ofjoseph.

39:40.730 --> 39:44.000
No one escapes her sacred duty.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.850
Heave!

40:00.520 --> 40:02.180
Heave!

40:05.850 --> 40:07.510
Heave!

40:33.380 --> 40:35.500
By His hand.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.660
Let that be a lesson to you.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.830
Disperse.

42:06.030 --> 42:07.320
You should be thankful.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.270
Your temptation's been lifted.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.500
What did you do?

42:20.390 --> 42:22.670
I <i>saw</i> you at Loaves and Fishes

42:22.670 --> 42:24.280
talking to that Martha.

42:25.260 --> 42:28.220
Aunt Lydia told me to watch you.

42:28.220 --> 42:29.850
To try and protect you.

42:39.210 --> 42:41.420
What did you say to her?

42:43.210 --> 42:45.090
I <i>saved</i> you.

42:46.210 --> 42:48.250
We <i>saved</i> you.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.440
You "saved" me?

43:10.370 --> 43:12.240
What did you do?

43:12.240 --> 43:14.560
What did you do?

43:14.560 --> 43:16.440
Do you have any idea
what you did?

43:16.440 --> 43:17.450
Do you?

43:17.450 --> 43:19.450
You fucking bitch!

43:19.450 --> 43:20.890
- Do you?
- June, stop it!

43:20.890 --> 43:23.710
Do you know what you did?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.180
Do you?

43:28.420 --> 43:30.670
You fucking bitch!
