00:30.856 --> 00:34.730
LUCY: Food is more
than just fuel.

00:34.860 --> 00:42.216
It's sharing, it's conversation,
it's hello and goodbye.

00:42.346 --> 00:45.610
It's giving and receiving.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.090
It's a prayer.

00:47.221 --> 00:51.399
It's what we dream of
and everything we fear.

00:51.529 --> 00:54.010
Food is where we come
from and it's what

00:54.141 --> 00:56.621
we'll all eventually become.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.928
But too much food creates waste.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.062
Waste is destroying our world.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.369
Environmentalists agree
thatdisposable plastic cutlery

01:05.500 --> 01:07.850
is the single greatest
threat to our planet.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.162
I'm Lucy Vanderton,
and I created.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.599
Incredible Edible
Cutlery to bring

01:17.729 --> 01:19.340
an end to that destruction.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.995
We all know you can'teat
food without cutlery.

01:23.126 --> 01:26.608
But now, you can eat
cutlery without food.

01:26.738 --> 01:30.699
Incredible Edible Cutlery isa
vision for mankind's future.

01:30.829 --> 01:34.355
As an ethnically diversefemale-led
company innovating

01:34.485 --> 01:39.360
in a white male-dominatedworld,
we reflect that future,

01:39.490 --> 01:44.191
our mission to rid the planetof
disposable plastic cutlery

01:44.321 --> 01:48.282
and save the world
one bite at a time.

01:48.412 --> 01:49.718
(CRUNCH)

01:53.330 --> 01:57.900
OK, this is bullshit.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.467
Well, I think it's inspiring.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.966
You're positive and
you're uplifting.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.905
And naive and stupid.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.995
And... and please, that
family was fake as fuck.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.170
OK, yeah.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.431
I'll redo it.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.000
Listen, do you
remember the first thing

02:11.131 --> 02:13.568
I said to you at Tufts?

02:13.698 --> 02:17.833
That I saw a beautiful,
intelligent black woman

02:17.963 --> 02:23.143
who has the potential tobe
the Beyonce of business.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.928
That's why I agreed
to mentor you.

02:26.058 --> 02:29.714
I want that person back, Jess.

02:29.845 --> 02:33.936
Listen to the Beyonce
inside you, girlfriend.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.727

02:48.168 --> 02:50.692

you're paying the bills.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.696
Welcome to Brandon's
Outdoor Experience.

02:54.826 --> 02:59.744
Are you ready for the
ultimateteam-building challenge?

02:59.875 --> 03:02.834
It's called Ball Quest.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
(GROANING)

03:05.315 --> 03:06.969
You guys can do this.

03:07.099 --> 03:08.536
You're all working as a unit.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.146
(GROANING)

03:10.277 --> 03:12.366
The ball's your enemy.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.802
(GROANING)

03:13.932 --> 03:16.152
Don't let that
piece of shit win.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.502
Motherfucker.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.896
It's too heavy.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.593
We can't move this.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.987
If we all push it together,
do you think maybe we can?

03:25.117 --> 03:26.554
How do we get it on the podium?

03:26.684 --> 03:28.077
Excuse me, sir.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.471
Are we allowed to put
the podium on its side.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.950
I can't tell you how to do it.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.343
That'd be cheating, right?

03:33.474 --> 03:34.953
Hey, we're not trying to cheat.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.434
We just want to clarifywhat
we can and cannot do.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.306
Come on, people.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.611
Figure it out.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.614
Think team.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.312
Aidan, go lay
down in front of it.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.704
We'll use you as a ramp.

03:46.835 --> 03:47.705
That's fine with me, I guess.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.358
Wait.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.054
Hey, stop.

03:49.185 --> 03:49.925
Don't lay down.

03:50.055 --> 03:50.839
He's fucking with you.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.406
Oh.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.536
You almost got me there.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.235
OK.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.430
What we need to do is usethese
two poles as a railroad

03:57.454 --> 03:59.717
so we can roll the
ballthingy up unto the thing.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.241
OK, yeah.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.287
And then use the ropes
as a pulley system

04:04.418 --> 04:06.202
to get the ball on
top of the rails.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.943
This is not fun at all.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.466
It's not supposed to be fun.

04:09.597 --> 04:10.641
OK, well it's working.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.034
It's not moving.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.164
Pull it harder.

04:13.253 --> 04:13.992
Wait.

04:14.123 --> 04:14.950
Use a pole as a lever.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.517
Yeah, that's a good idea.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.779
But we only have two poles.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.607
Right.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.279
And we need both the poles
tomake the actual train tracks.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.890
Jess, let's just forgetabout
the railroad tracks, OK?

04:22.914 --> 04:25.526
Let's just focus on movingthe
ball toward the podium.

04:25.656 --> 04:28.616
We'll worry about getting
it up when we get there.

04:28.746 --> 04:32.097
(GROANING)

04:40.236 --> 04:42.064
(CRUNCH)

04:42.194 --> 04:44.893
Oh, shit.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.938
What?

04:47.069 --> 04:48.853
(SCREAMING)

04:51.769 --> 04:53.945
(GROANING)

04:55.512 --> 04:56.818

04:56.948 --> 05:01.562
Oh, gosh darn it,
that... that really hurt.

05:01.692 --> 05:02.998
My leg.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.304
Nice work, FT.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.349
We have to try
and move it somehow.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.962
Have you got another
pole, like a metal one?

05:11.093 --> 05:14.531
I want to say
that I'm mad, but I

05:14.662 --> 05:19.014
am severely disappointed
in every one of you,

05:19.144 --> 05:22.539
especially you, Jess.

05:22.670 --> 05:23.714
I'm embarrassed.

05:23.845 --> 05:24.454
I'm sorry.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.326
Lucy, I was... I was trying.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.849
AIDAN: Oh, gosh darn it.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.059
We were having so much fun.

05:29.154 --> 05:32.506
(MUSIC PLAYING)

(ENGINE REVVING)

06:17.464 --> 06:19.422
Oh damn, it's hot.

06:22.338 --> 06:25.297
Hey, psst.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.430
Lucy giving you
a hard time, huh?

06:27.561 --> 06:28.344
It comes with the territory.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.563
You are the hate sponge.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.825
The what?

06:30.955 --> 06:33.741
The hate sponge,
the punching bag.

06:33.871 --> 06:37.440
I was the hate sponge for
theyears until you came along.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.964
My advice is, soak it in.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.836
And if you ever
get any feelings,

06:41.966 --> 06:45.796
just push them down with
booze and video games.

06:45.927 --> 06:52.368
You'll find that life getseasier
soon, very soon.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.152
Did you just try to wink at me?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.024
I did wink at you.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.634
Yikes, why?

06:57.765 --> 06:58.983
OK.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.203
Keep this to yourself,
but very soon, I'm

07:01.333 --> 07:04.598
going to be taking on the
brandnew role of vice president,

07:04.728 --> 07:06.648
and you'll take my place
as number one assistant,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.621
and Lucy's going to hire
a brand new hate sponge,

07:08.645 --> 07:12.257
so it's all good.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.694
OK.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.236
Well, I hate to break
it to you, but Lucy's

07:15.260 --> 07:17.437
appointing me vice president.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.394
What?

07:18.525 --> 07:19.787
Yeah, man.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.223
(MUSIC PLAYING)

07:21.353 --> 07:23.268
No, that's not... Yeah, it is.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.662
No, I don't... I don't think so.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.185
All right, gang.

07:27.316 --> 07:30.101
Let's circle up right here.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.277
Pretty spectacular, huh?

07:32.408 --> 07:36.238
Every once in a while,
mothernature likes to strip for us,

07:36.368 --> 07:39.110
just show us how sexy she is.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.982
I know it looks daunting, but don't worry.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.679
It's an easy hike down.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.744
We're going to track alongthis
ridge and down the canyon.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.639
Where does this go?

07:45.769 --> 07:48.946
Oh, don't worry about that.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.905
That's the advanced route.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.603
No offense, but I don't
think this group is 100%

07:53.734 --> 07:54.894
ready for the advanced route.

07:54.996 --> 07:55.605
(CHUCKLING)

07:55.736 --> 07:56.476
Yeah.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.606
Nope.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.262
No, we're doing the advanced.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.611
(CHUCKLING)

08:01.742 --> 08:02.482
BRANDON: Seriously?

08:02.612 --> 08:03.918
LUCY: Yeah.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.504
I can't recommend more
strongly that this group

08:05.528 --> 08:07.487
takes the beginner route.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.227
That's an advanced
cave system that's

08:09.358 --> 08:11.012
for experienced spelunkers.

08:11.142 --> 08:15.930
Look, if we can navigate
theadvanced route of the deepest

08:16.060 --> 08:18.454
cave systems of
New Mexico, then we

08:18.585 --> 08:22.589
can navigate the challenges
oftoday's business environment.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.200
The only way for
a muscle to grow

08:25.330 --> 08:27.768
is to have something
to push against,

08:27.898 --> 08:30.510
and we all know that
thebiggest muscle in the body

08:30.640 --> 08:31.380
is the brain.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.554
Nope.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.339
This is the perfect opportunity

08:34.470 --> 08:36.864
for the brain to grow.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.082
Let's get to it.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.212
Come on!

08:42.043 --> 08:43.087
Well, checks cleared.

08:43.217 --> 08:45.873
You guys signed your releases.

08:46.003 --> 08:49.616
Let's go bone some stone.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.834
Rappelling.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.285
SUZY: We're
rappelling down there?

08:52.401 --> 08:54.534
Well, look, you
are all more than

08:54.664 --> 08:57.798
welcome to opt out and havea
lovely time by yourself

08:57.928 --> 08:59.974
on the bus thinking
about the new direction

09:00.104 --> 09:01.168
your career might be going.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.280
All right, everybody.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.021
Listen up.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.458
Now, the number one rule
thatyou must follow at all times

09:06.589 --> 09:09.461
is do whatever the fuck
Isay the second I say it.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.202
That's probably the
most important thing.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.596
Now, on top of that,
I'm goingto go over a couple of dos

09:13.727 --> 09:16.207
and do not dos.

09:16.338 --> 09:21.604
Do keep your helmet on
your head at all times.

09:21.735 --> 09:25.260
Do not consume alcohol
or illegal drugs

09:25.390 --> 09:27.088
before entering the cave.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.742
Do be vigilant.

09:28.872 --> 09:32.441
Keep your eyes peeled
for spiders, scorpions,

09:32.572 --> 09:35.139
or poisonous snakes,
because they are abundant,

09:35.270 --> 09:37.359
and they are trying to
kill you at all times.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.057
Now, if we're lucky,
we mayencounter some cave paintings.

09:40.188 --> 09:43.234
These are from the AcamaTribe
of first Americans.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.497
Do not touch the cave paintings.

09:45.628 --> 09:50.328
And always remember,
they were here first.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.113
Lucy, what have you got?

09:52.243 --> 09:56.247
I am actually 1/64
Acama, so if any of you

09:56.378 --> 09:58.641
want to touch or
examine the paintings,

09:58.772 --> 10:00.556
then just clear
it with me first.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.602
I'll be assuming the
role of tribal elder

10:02.732 --> 10:06.083
for the duration of the trip.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.476
Cool.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.651
Let's do this.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.218
SUZY: There's really no stairs?

10:10.348 --> 10:11.915
BRANDON: Where do you
want the stair on?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.613
AIDAN: Hey, guys.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.092
I think I'm stuck.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.679
Just for the record,
I'm definitely getting

10:16.703 --> 10:17.810
the vice president position.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.140
OK.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.944
Well, for the record,
Lucy and I have already

10:20.968 --> 10:22.510
discussed my new role as
vicepresident in great detail

10:22.534 --> 10:25.189
for the last two
months, so... OK.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.254
Well, I've been at the
companyway longer than you, OK?

10:27.278 --> 10:28.758
Why would Lucy
promote you over me?

10:28.889 --> 10:29.367
Three words.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.586
OK.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.109
Master of Business
Administration.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.546
That's four words, including of.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.288
Isn't counting... correct
me if I'm wrong...

10:37.419 --> 10:38.681
A valuable business skill?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.398
Yeah, it is, but of
doesn't count as a word.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.728
It's like the.

10:41.858 --> 10:42.966
Nobody gives a shit
about those two words.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.208
I can't do this.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.167
I really can't do this, Lucy.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.559
You can do this.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.170
I know what you're capable of.

10:49.300 --> 10:54.523
Look, are you a woman
who runs with wolves?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.177
Are you?

10:56.307 --> 11:00.442
I think I'm more the womanwho
runs away from wolves,

11:00.572 --> 11:01.985
because they can smell
my fear.- Not anymore.

11:02.009 --> 11:02.705
Not anymore.

11:02.836 --> 11:03.445
They get off on it.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.315
I'm going to die.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.274
Look, I believe in you.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.404
Why?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.103
So you have to believe in you.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.081
Otherwise, you're saying
I'mwrong about who I believe in,

11:11.105 --> 11:12.778
and... and I don't thinkyou're
saying that, are you?

11:12.802 --> 11:14.021
Not intentionally.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.370
, No no.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.502
You're still on
the edible cutlery,

11:17.633 --> 11:21.506
whereas I'm all over thebrand-new
exciting project, OK?

11:21.637 --> 11:22.986
What does that tell you?

11:23.117 --> 11:24.703
I wouldn't exactlycall Vanderton University

11:24.727 --> 11:26.337
a brand-new exciting project.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.315
We've actually rebranded as
the Vanderton Wealth institute,

11:28.339 --> 11:29.577
but you wouldn't know
that, because you

11:29.601 --> 11:30.777
weren't in the meetings.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.102
Yeah, because those
meetings are dumb,

11:32.126 --> 11:33.954
and it's just busy work for you.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.084
We get free coffee.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.697
You see that there?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.747
Hey, quick question.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.358
I got a call from my
transport team on Friday

11:47.489 --> 11:50.013
and they said that our
quarterly check bounced.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.623
That's weird.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.581
Did you call Medfirst?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.757
Yeah, I did.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.064
Tanner said that
we're overdrawn.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.762
That shouldn't be happening.

11:59.893 --> 12:00.632
I'll look into it.

12:00.763 --> 12:01.763
OK.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.074
You know, if running
the accounts department

12:07.204 --> 12:10.730
is getting to be too much for
you, you can just let me know.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.253
I'm fine.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.863
OK.

12:13.994 --> 12:17.954
Well, if not, you can
always talk to me.

12:18.085 --> 12:21.175
I'm available during
business hours.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.305
Thanks.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.655
That's very generous of you.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.309
DEREK: I think I felt some rain.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.591
Oh, that's pretty scary, huh?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.225
You don't want to
piss your pants.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.855
I don't think the girls downhere
would like that very much.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.879
Hey, come on, man.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.447
Don't go ragging on the intern.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.015
Aidan pissed his
pants one single time.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.585
Surely you should
be able to move on.

12:36.712 --> 12:37.800
Great banter, guys.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.106
You're making me laugh.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.890
I don't think I can.

12:41.021 --> 12:41.586
Please.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.023
Yes, you can.

12:43.153 --> 12:43.980
Brandon!

12:44.111 --> 12:45.547
And now is the time, OK?

12:45.677 --> 12:48.332
You just need to nut upand
put that pussy into it.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.463
Now, follow my lead.

12:52.946 --> 12:53.946
You.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.213
Woo!

12:59.343 --> 13:01.737
GLORIA: Our insurance
does not cover this.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.564
BRANDON: Lamps on.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.391
FREDDIE: Lights on?

13:03.521 --> 13:04.392
Oh my god.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.785
LUCY: Get your light on.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.660
(GRUNTING)

13:13.749 --> 13:16.447
What's happening?

13:19.624 --> 13:21.583
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

13:21.713 --> 13:22.758
LUCY: No, you're not.

13:22.889 --> 13:23.585
Yes, I am.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.021
No, you're not.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.458
Your panic attack
is not authorized.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.984
I can't be doing this.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.507
I hate it.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.987
Lucy, I hate it.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.336
BRANDON: That a girl.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.555
Keep pumping those elbows.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.296
I think my fricking
knee's dinged up.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.125
BRANDON: No pressure,
butmaybe hurry up a little.

13:42.256 --> 13:42.909
LUCY: It's all right.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.127
Keep going.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.658
BRANDON: Looking
good, looking good.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.652
LUCY: Less than six feet.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.567
BRANDON: Yeah, you got this.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.091
SUZY: I'm so scared.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.381
BRANDON: Yeah, but look cute.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.440
Don't worry about it.

13:56.009 --> 13:56.836
LUCY: There you go.

13:56.966 --> 13:57.532
BRANDON: All right.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.402
That a girl.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.533
Good job, good job.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.621
All right.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.947
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.625
I guess I'm alive.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.846
Exactly, and you probably
feelmore alive than you ever have,

14:06.976 --> 14:07.411
right?

14:07.542 --> 14:08.848
Uh-huh.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.024
Yeah, you do.

14:11.154 --> 14:11.676
You did it.

14:11.807 --> 14:12.852
Guys, come on.

14:12.982 --> 14:13.722
We made it.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.507
We made it as a team.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.640
Teamwork makes the
dream work, right?

14:18.770 --> 14:19.850
Makes the dream work, yeah.

14:19.946 --> 14:20.772
Come on.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.991
(CHEERING)

14:23.036 --> 14:24.820
All right, listen up.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.145
I'm going to ask
you to do something.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.867
This might sound
a little far out,

14:27.997 --> 14:29.564
but just go with me, all right?

14:29.694 --> 14:32.088
Turn your head lamps off.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.569
(SNAPPING)

14:38.660 --> 14:40.009
(GASPS)

14:40.140 --> 14:41.489
Oh my god.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.100
Oh, oh my god.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.189
That never gets old.

14:46.320 --> 14:46.973
LUCY: Glorious.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.365
Wow.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.889
BRANDON: Pretty
spectacular, right?

14:50.019 --> 14:50.498
GLORIA: Incredible.

14:50.628 --> 14:51.716
Yeah, good.

14:51.847 --> 14:52.717
OK.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.676
Welcome to Cathedral Cavern.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.166
This is pretty much
the crown jewel

14:56.243 --> 14:58.245
of this entire cave system.

14:58.375 --> 15:01.335
The great state of New Mexicowas
kind enough to rig it up

15:01.465 --> 15:03.032
with some auxiliary
battery lighting

15:03.163 --> 15:06.209
so you can really
feel the full effect.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.340
Spectacular.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.777
(SNIFFING)

15:08.908 --> 15:09.908
Namaste.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.393
Feel free to explore,
lookaround, enjoy yourselves.

15:16.524 --> 15:20.615
I'll be sitting over
there eating a Clementine.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.357
Hey, guys, it's
an Acoma painting.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.098
It's Acama.

15:25.228 --> 15:25.881
Acama?

15:26.012 --> 15:28.057
(HUMMING)

15:28.188 --> 15:29.189
So you can read all this?

15:29.319 --> 15:30.407
LUCY: Yeah, somewhat.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.104
Hey.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.540
OK.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.759
So I guess she offered
us both the position.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.806
She's playing us by danglingthe
same carrot, a carrot

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939
the both of us can't eat.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.029
It's manipulative, it's
petty, it's deceitful,

15:43.159 --> 15:45.335
it's disrespectful.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.728
It's a classic Lucy.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.401
I guess she has to
keep us hungry to keep

15:48.425 --> 15:50.123
the company afloat.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.951
Wait, what do you mean afloat?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.909
Shit.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.651
OK, keep this on the DL, OK?

15:56.781 --> 15:57.781
Down low.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.219
Yeah, I know what that is.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.176
Don't let it come up to the
surface, down low.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.134
I understand what that is.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.744
OK.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.504
Vanderton University
hasbeen a complete disaster.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.088
It's been hemorrhaging
money for months.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.247
I keep telling her to shutit
down to save the company,

16:08.271 --> 16:09.316
but she won't listen.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.273
Look at this.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.709
Put your hand right there.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.580
Are you sure it's not
a curse or something?

16:12.710 --> 16:13.320
Yes, yes.

16:13.450 --> 16:13.929
No.

16:14.060 --> 16:14.669
Look.

16:14.799 --> 16:15.583
Feel that.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.063
Oh.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.803
Dammit.

16:18.934 --> 16:19.955
I guess it's hard to sell
abusiness based on a personality

16:19.979 --> 16:23.983
when it's your personality.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.594
Oh, yeah, because she sucks.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.769
Yeah, big time.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.206
(QUAKING)

16:31.381 --> 16:34.297
(SHOUTING)

16:39.433 --> 16:43.654
What the fuck just happened?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.178
That was a geologic incident.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.308
What?

16:46.396 --> 16:49.182
Yeah, a little tectonic tremor.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.141
In English.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.055
Earthquake?

16:53.186 --> 16:54.317
Oh my god.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.536
So what... what do we do?

16:55.666 --> 16:58.408
(MUSIC PLAYING)

17:00.019 --> 17:01.368
(THUD)

17:01.498 --> 17:02.804
(SCREAMING)

17:02.934 --> 17:04.196
LUCY: Oh, shit.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.205
(SCREAMING)

17:13.336 --> 17:14.771
Shouldn't you go
last, not first?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.532
Yeah, but no,
because I should really go first check

17:16.557 --> 17:17.819
the tunnel integrity, right?

17:17.949 --> 17:18.689
Wait, wait, wait.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.647
You can't leave us here!

17:20.778 --> 17:22.084
See, it's so narrow.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.564
I can't turn around
at this point.

17:23.694 --> 17:24.845
You don't need to turn around.

17:24.868 --> 17:26.348
Just crawl back.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.525
It's probably best
foreverybody if I just get out,

17:28.656 --> 17:29.656
you know?

17:29.744 --> 17:30.353
See you guys on the other side.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.876
No.

17:32.007 --> 17:32.834
(QUAKING)

17:32.964 --> 17:34.792
(SHOUTING)

17:34.923 --> 17:35.923
Shit.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.537
You know what?

17:40.668 --> 17:41.277
I'm going to back out.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.974
Get out.

17:43.105 --> 17:43.758
BILLY: Yeah, come on, man.
BRANDON: It's the best thing.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.629
I'm just going to... (CLATTERING)

17:45.760 --> 17:48.458
(SCREAMING)

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
(BOOM)

17:57.554 --> 17:59.382
Brandon?

17:59.513 --> 18:00.513
Are you OK?

18:04.996 --> 18:06.172
You all right, Brandon?

18:10.437 --> 18:11.437
Brandon?

18:14.180 --> 18:17.748
OK, he's not breathing.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.054
Oh, god.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.055
Oh, Jesus.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.753
Hey, hey, I'm CPR trained.

18:27.628 --> 18:28.759
Yep, he's dead.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.763
Oh my god.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.200
No, no, no.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.681
No.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.422
Does anyone's phone work?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.688
There's no service.

18:44.819 --> 18:49.084
All right, we got
to get out of here.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.607
Look at the cracks.

18:50.738 --> 18:51.976
There's something in the cracks.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.456
Maybe you could
still make it through.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.221
(GRUNTING)

18:55.351 --> 18:56.222
It's rocks.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.701
You can't dig through that.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.834
There's probably anetwork of Acama tunnels.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.681
I mean, that... that'ssomething
that we would do.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.447
Maybe there's a
door, like a cave door.

19:04.578 --> 19:08.669
There's a tunnel.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.801
Yeah, but it's
going the wrong way.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.804
A tunnel going down isbetter
than no tunnel at all.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.066
Right, guys?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.765
No.

19:17.895 --> 19:18.766
We're fucked.

19:18.896 --> 19:22.204
There's nothing.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.207
We are so totally,
totally fucked.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.948
Help!

19:27.078 --> 19:29.124
Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.256
(SCREAMING)

19:30.386 --> 19:31.387
(THUDS)

19:31.518 --> 19:32.301
Hey, hey.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.259
Help!

19:33.389 --> 19:34.521
Stop it.

19:34.651 --> 19:35.802
You're going to cause
another cave-in.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.567
Everything always happens to me.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.398
We're trapped.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.487
We're all going
to die down here.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.664
We are going to die, huh?

19:47.795 --> 19:49.492
Billy.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.582
We are all trapped and we
aregoing to fucking die down here.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.192
Billy.

19:53.322 --> 19:53.801
(SLAPS)

19:53.931 --> 19:56.151
Oh.

19:56.282 --> 19:56.934
Ow.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.589
Advanced.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.896
Why do you just say we had
to do the fucking advanced?

20:02.026 --> 20:05.160
(THUD)

20:07.118 --> 20:08.685
There's nothing.

20:08.816 --> 20:09.816
There's no way out.

20:13.821 --> 20:17.041
At least our families won'thave
to pay for our funerals,

20:17.172 --> 20:20.262
seeing how we've already
been buried alive.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.090
OK, people.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.615
I think that the situationis under control.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.400
How'd do you work that out?

20:27.530 --> 20:30.490
It's only a matter ofhours
before we get rescued.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.883
I mean, I personally
put in the caving permit

20:33.014 --> 20:35.538
with a completeitinerary in that dropbox

20:35.669 --> 20:38.237
at the ranger station.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.283
So let's just relax,
enjoy the adventure.

20:41.414 --> 20:45.244
It's a perfectteam-building opportunity.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.464
It's like our own
private escape room.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.467
We do need to make
the most of our space,

20:51.598 --> 20:55.863
so this area should be
thedesignated toilet zone.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.605
And I'm thinking that
this area over here

20:58.735 --> 21:01.869
should be our private zone
forpersonal reflection, you know?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.959
Much like the interfaith
area at the airport.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.745
Most importantly,
we need tomanage our resources carefully.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.748
I've done a complete
inventoryof our food supplies,

21:11.879 --> 21:15.752
and it consists of a
samplebox of Edible Cutlery

21:15.883 --> 21:19.321
that Aidan brought with him.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.845
You brought a box
of product samples?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.107
Yeah.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.433
I always keep a
set in my backpack.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.564
You never know
when you might need

21:25.588 --> 21:26.850
some cutlery that you can eat.

21:26.981 --> 21:30.114
Aidan's dedication
to the flagship product

21:30.245 --> 21:32.900
should be seen as
aninspiration and a life-saving

21:33.030 --> 21:36.164
example to us all.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.948
Aidan.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.254
Yeah.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.038
If you don't have
gum for all of us,

21:41.169 --> 21:42.475
then you should just spit that.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.345
What?

21:43.476 --> 21:44.476
Give it to me.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.916
Good boy.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.483
OK.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.094
Hydration-wise,
we havethese few bottles of water

21:53.224 --> 21:54.617
and Billy's CamelBak.

21:54.748 --> 21:55.618
No.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.359
This is private property.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.317
Why should I be penalized
justbecause I'm the only one who

21:58.447 --> 22:00.101
properly prepared?

22:00.231 --> 22:02.973
This excursion is fully fundedby
Incredible Edible Cutlery,

22:03.104 --> 22:05.498
so all of the equipment,
including your CamelBak,

22:05.628 --> 22:06.628
is company property.

22:06.716 --> 22:07.891
Oh, no, it's not.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.851
Just hand over the
goddamn CamelBak.

22:10.981 --> 22:14.289
This is bullshit.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.900
OK, please pass
these potato forks.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.599
Take one prong each.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.427
Just one prong?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.080
At least break out the spoons?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.734
No spoons.

22:24.865 --> 22:29.348
Forks, one prong,
and I'llexpect those handles back.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.611
I know it's not
all about me, but I

22:31.741 --> 22:33.893
really feel like my leg
mayneed some kind of treatment.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.790
Just keep the wound cleanand
watch out for numbness

22:36.920 --> 22:39.314
or a foul-smelling discharge.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.621
Those are the first
signs of gangrene.

22:41.751 --> 22:42.752
Gangrene?

22:42.883 --> 22:43.710
LUCY: OK.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.015
Oh my god.

22:45.146 --> 22:48.367
I am going to try
and get some sleep.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.369
Wake me up when the
rescuers get here.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.594
Hey, you want to
generate a little heat?

22:58.725 --> 22:59.900
No.

23:00.030 --> 23:03.294
LUCY: Billy, you're
on light duty.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.862
Yeah.

23:05.993 --> 23:06.733
How about you?

23:06.863 --> 23:07.863
You want to...

23:10.911 --> 23:12.260

LUCY (VOICEOVER):
In this chapter,

23:22.139 --> 23:25.055
you'll learn to be
aVanderton visionary using

23:25.186 --> 23:29.495
the three C's, confidence, collaboration,

23:29.625 --> 23:31.932

Fuck!

23:58.959 --> 24:01.265
WOMAN 1: Aidan.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.790
Aidan.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.226
Who is it?

24:08.882 --> 24:12.102
Britney?

24:12.233 --> 24:13.539
Is it Britney, bitch?

24:13.669 --> 24:16.585
BRITNEY SPEARS: Yes,
it's me, Britney Spears.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.195
Stay strong, Aidan.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
I'm coming to save you.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.861
Oh.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.689
Hi, Suzy.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.170
Hi.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.608
Do you mind if I... oh
yeah, Suzy.

24:39.739 --> 24:40.174
Yeah.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.304
(MOANING)

24:41.392 --> 24:42.698
SUZY: Can you call me Suzanne?

24:42.829 --> 24:43.569
MAY: Suzanne.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.005
(MOANING)

24:48.574 --> 24:50.445
Gently, oh.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.186
They've been going
at it all night.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.541
I didn't realize Suzy
and May were a couple.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.456
They're not.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.806
At least, they weren't.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.721
But I guess the
possibilityof imminent death

25:05.852 --> 25:07.854
makes you super horny.

25:07.984 --> 25:08.984
Yeah.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.469
Who's this?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.907
Is this your white dad?

25:18.038 --> 25:20.214
Seriously?

25:20.344 --> 25:22.346
You don't recognize him?

25:22.477 --> 25:25.262
It's Gary Sinise
from CSI New York.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.612
Right.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.353
He's, like, kind of
a big deal for you?

25:29.484 --> 25:31.051
Yeah.

25:31.181 --> 25:35.882
On CSI, Gary treats
his team like a family,

25:36.012 --> 25:37.652
and, like, they always
care for each other

25:37.710 --> 25:39.233
and have each other's back.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.844
And, you know,
I thought I found it when I quit school

25:41.975 --> 25:48.677
and joined the
company, so... Wow.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.592
That's either the most
pathetic thing I've

25:50.723 --> 25:51.985
ever heard of the most tragic.

25:52.115 --> 25:52.899
FREDDIE: Ouch.

25:53.029 --> 25:53.769
JESS: Yeah.

25:53.900 --> 25:54.944
Wow, sorry.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.269
That... that came
out really harsh.

fine, we're hungry.

I guessgood luck to them, right?

26:04.258 --> 26:05.694

26:05.825 --> 26:07.914

Hi.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.931
What's up?

26:25.061 --> 26:28.369
I just wanted to see if youneeded
some help with sleeping.

26:31.981 --> 26:39.423
I mean, silk sheets would
benice, or any kind of sheets.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.991
I have a great way
to help you to sleep.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.906
(ZIPPING)

26:44.037 --> 26:46.343
Oh, no.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.780
What do you mean no?

26:47.910 --> 26:52.741
I just mean no.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.850
We've taken this whole thingfar
enough, don't you think?

26:54.874 --> 26:57.572
Well, no, not really.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.400
I mean, you've
never eaten me out

26:59.530 --> 27:02.882
while I've given you a rim job.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.841
I don't even thinkthat's
physically possible.

27:05.972 --> 27:09.236
Well, certainly not
with that attitude.

27:09.366 --> 27:14.023
OK, well, I've made
aunilateral decision to stop.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.329
Well, you can't.

27:15.459 --> 27:16.635
Well, I have.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.332
Well, I haven't
granted you unilateral

27:18.462 --> 27:19.681
decision-making powers.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.137
I don't need you
to grant them to me.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.510
I already have them.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.992
It's called being an
independent adult.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.820
(CHUCKLING)

27:27.950 --> 27:30.083
What's so funny?

27:30.213 --> 27:33.434
When have you ever had
an independent adult?

27:33.564 --> 27:34.827
Since forever.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.220
Freddie, Freddie.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.351
Come on.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.876
You would be lost without me.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.443
Everything you know is from me.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.445
I taught you how to fuck.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.363
I didn't learn how
to fuck from you.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.843
I learned how to fuck from porn.

I can feel my lupus flaring up.

Where the hell are they?

28:08.164 --> 28:11.602
Look, they're diggingthrough
meters of solid rock.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.213
It's going to take
a little while.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.085

why can't we hear them?

What did you wish for?

28:53.035 --> 28:55.385
I hope it was to get us rescued.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.561
Well, if I tell you
what I wished for,

28:57.692 --> 29:00.173
that means it won't come true.

29:00.303 --> 29:03.045
You wished for somethingelse, didn't you?

29:03.176 --> 29:04.960

or I don't know,

29:05.091 --> 29:07.658

here on my dollar,

29:11.967 --> 29:14.709

on all wishes.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.147
I'll tell you when I wished for.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.933
I wished for a boss whowasn't
a total fucking bitch.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.985
I asked her for a dollarbill
to go to the bathroom

29:30.116 --> 29:31.900
and she said no.

29:32.031 --> 29:35.556
You wouldn't give her a dollarbill
so she could wipe herself?

29:35.686 --> 29:38.341

was your birthday,

29:38.472 --> 29:40.735

on a $100 bill but me.

29:44.957 --> 29:48.047
I can tell you why shewant
to keep her hundreds.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.137
It's because it's all the
money that she has left.

29:50.179 --> 29:53.617

they're empty of, yes.

God dammit, guys.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.479
I just bought a dirt bike.

30:29.610 --> 30:32.787
Look, we're all
in this together.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.658
No, we're not.

30:34.789 --> 30:37.009
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

30:37.139 --> 30:40.360
I was going to quit on Monday.

30:40.490 --> 30:41.752
I can't believe this shit.

30:41.883 --> 30:45.017
I was doing this for all of us.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.367
If the company is
in trouble, it's

30:47.497 --> 30:50.849
because of yourincompetence and laziness.

30:50.979 --> 30:54.069
It was your lack
ofcommunication and work ethic

30:54.200 --> 30:55.462
that got us in this mess.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.725
You don't listen to
a single thing we say.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.206
You don't let us make
a single decision.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.861
Lucy, why should we workhard
for you when you steal

31:02.991 --> 31:04.688
any good ideas we come up with?

31:04.819 --> 31:08.649
What are you talking about?

31:08.779 --> 31:13.088
The Edible Cutlery,
Lucy, it was my idea.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.311
The hell it was.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.052
I can't believe this.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.291
I came up with the idea when
Ifirst started working for Lucy.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.945
All she had back then
was beauty products.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.057
OK.

31:25.187 --> 31:28.190
So maybe the spoons
were your idea,

31:28.321 --> 31:31.193
but the knives and
forks were mine.

31:31.324 --> 31:34.414
Spoons imply knives and forks.

31:34.544 --> 31:38.331
No, there is no such
legal implication.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.811
I mean, anyone can
come up with an idea.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.509
It's another thing
to turn it into

31:42.639 --> 31:44.728
a multi-million-dollar company.

31:44.859 --> 31:46.905
Formermulti-million-dollar company.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.907
I can't believe
you spent all this

31:49.037 --> 31:52.606
money we don't have on
anidiotic team-building trip.

31:52.736 --> 31:56.001
Well, I needed to
raise your idiotic game.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.786
By burying us alive?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.658
So the only good idea
this company's ever had

32:01.789 --> 32:04.487
belongs to Freddie the fuck toy.

32:04.618 --> 32:05.836
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:05.967 --> 32:07.664
Freddie the what?

32:07.795 --> 32:10.363
Why do you think we call you FT?

32:10.493 --> 32:12.669
Because those are my
initials, Freddy Tiwari.

32:16.717 --> 32:17.457
Oh.

32:17.587 --> 32:18.719
Oh my god.

32:18.849 --> 32:19.415
You knew?

32:19.546 --> 32:20.764
You all knew?

32:20.895 --> 32:23.289
That Lucy uses you
as a human dildo?

32:23.419 --> 32:24.203
Yeah.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.248
Don't put it like that.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.772
What is wrong with
two adult colleagues

32:28.903 --> 32:30.818
having a relationship,
especially if they're

32:30.949 --> 32:32.211
chill and not weird about it?

32:32.341 --> 32:33.341
Exactly.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.648
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

32:34.778 --> 32:36.017
Because Freddie was
an intern at the time,

32:36.041 --> 32:37.694
and fucking an
intern is essentially

32:37.825 --> 32:41.742
half a step above fucking
ababysitter, in which case, no.

32:41.872 --> 32:42.893
No shade to you or Aidan, but...

32:42.917 --> 32:43.439
Oh, none taken.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.093
JESS: Yikes.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.941
Being Lucy's fuck toy isthe
only reason why you've

32:46.965 --> 32:48.792
gotten preferential treatment.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.055
What?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.231
No, I don't get
preferential treatment.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.276
I saw her give
you an extra prong.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.105
I got the same crappy
prong as everyone else.

32:57.236 --> 33:00.848
And besides, it's not
entirely consensual.

33:03.546 --> 33:04.678
OK?

33:04.808 --> 33:07.028
Yeah, she's been
Weinsteining me.

33:07.159 --> 33:08.725
Oh my god.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.771
I have not Weinsteined you.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.078
I have not Weinsteined anyone.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.601
OK, OK.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.211
Maybe not the full
Weinstein, but you

33:16.342 --> 33:19.171
used your power in theworkplace
to get sexual favors.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.434
Oh, like I need to do that.

33:21.564 --> 33:24.437
We're a pair of
consenting adults.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.961
You could have walked
out at any time.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.354
You're my boss.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.804
I might not have
a job if I didn't

33:29.920 --> 33:32.140
agree to have sex with you.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.621
Grow up.

33:34.751 --> 33:37.058
All relationships are unequal.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.975
I mean, men have been fuckingtheir
secretaries for decades.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.585
Why can't women?

33:42.716 --> 33:46.198
I guess because
it's kind of horrible.

33:46.328 --> 33:50.724
Well, if women can't be
as horrible as men, then

33:50.854 --> 33:53.074
what's fucking feminism for?

33:53.205 --> 33:54.728
What?

33:54.858 --> 33:55.990
Right?

33:56.121 --> 33:58.123
That's a fresh
take on an old idea.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.038
(THUD)

34:04.912 --> 34:12.353
Chicken satay with
peanutsauce, roast belly pork

34:12.485 --> 34:13.485
with Parmesan potatoes.

34:21.536 --> 34:23.757
Black Forest gateau it's
salty caramel ice cream.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.411
Oh my god.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.257
I don't know what gateauis,
but that sounds good.

34:27.282 --> 34:30.545
I can go for that.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.547
Thank you.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.464
It's the best one.

34:35.594 --> 34:37.422
(GROANING)

34:37.553 --> 34:40.382
(WHIRRING)

34:41.992 --> 34:43.342
Where are you going?

34:43.472 --> 34:44.911
Over to the store
to get some Sprite.

34:49.826 --> 34:55.266
We're so fucked.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.529
We are so fucked.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.575
For God's sakes,
shut the fuck up.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.403
Oh, fuck you.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.450
Fuck you.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.191
Were all fucked because of you.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.299
You were the one who thoughtthat
a stupid team-building

35:08.323 --> 35:10.630
exercise and taking us downto
a fucking advance route

35:10.760 --> 35:13.937
into an underground hell
holewould somehow magically unfuck

35:14.068 --> 35:15.461
the company that you fucked.

35:15.591 --> 35:19.552
Hey, it's not Lucy'sfault
there was a cave-in.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.641
Thank you Suzy.

35:21.771 --> 35:24.383
Oh, fuck both of you.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.393
Hey, we all need to hold
it together down here.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.472
Why?

35:27.516 --> 35:28.952
Look, it's been days, people.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.723
We have not heard any
digging or drilling.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.826
So whether we keep
it together or not,

35:32.956 --> 35:35.002
we're still fucked, right?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.786
(GIGGLING)

35:36.917 --> 35:38.527
Anybody not fucked?

35:38.658 --> 35:40.703
The longest a human beinghas
ever gone without food

35:40.834 --> 35:43.154
and water is, like, a week,
and we ran out of both of them,

35:43.184 --> 35:45.273
so it's just a matter of time.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.580
Shut up.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.669
OK, I know.

35:56.241 --> 36:03.030
Listen, we don't know
forcertain when or if we're

36:03.161 --> 36:05.075
going to be rescued, right?

36:05.206 --> 36:10.211
But we do know for certain thatif
we don't eat something soon,

36:10.342 --> 36:11.081
we're all going to die.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.561
We know that.

36:12.692 --> 36:13.692
We're aware of that.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.347
I just want to mention the fact

36:15.477 --> 36:17.758
that there's one food sourcethat
we haven't yet explored.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.748
Oh my god.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.315
You're fucking kidding.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.751
Seriously?

36:28.882 --> 36:32.015
I'm not saying we
should eat Brandon.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.756
No.

36:33.887 --> 36:37.586
I'm just saying we
could eat Brandon.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.066
That's disgusting.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.415
I couldn't eat a person.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.375
I agree, it is disgusting.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.465
But at the same time,
I'mterribly fucking hungry.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.863
He did lead us down here.

36:53.994 --> 36:57.954
Helping us survive is
the least he can do.

36:58.085 --> 37:01.697
If we're going to
eat someone, it's

37:01.828 --> 37:05.092
more ethical to eat ourselves.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.748
You mean cut off our armsand
eat them like James Franco?

37:08.878 --> 37:11.577
I don't think James
Franco ate his own arm.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.666
I'm not even my own fucking arm.

37:13.796 --> 37:14.956
That's where I keep my watch.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.669
I heard you should
eat the brain,

37:16.799 --> 37:18.105
because it has sugar in it.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.760
I got a good idea, Gloria.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.128
Why don't you eat
your own brain?

37:22.152 --> 37:24.111
Let me reiterate, OK?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.418
I am not saying we
should eat Brandon.

37:26.548 --> 37:31.553
But if we did eat Brandon,
how would we go about it?

37:38.647 --> 37:42.999
I once took a sashimicourse
on vacation in Japan.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.915
Did it involve
cutting up human flesh?

37:46.046 --> 37:47.177
No, it was mostly salmon.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.397
Is it OK that I hate everything

37:49.528 --> 37:50.311
about this conversation?

37:50.442 --> 37:53.096
It's... it's... it's
not a conversation.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.751
It's a theoretical discussion.

37:55.882 --> 37:56.665
You know what?

37:56.796 --> 37:58.014
A thought experiment.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.016
Oh, these are
for customers only?

38:00.147 --> 38:03.411
Well, I'd be a customer if
you had any goddamn items.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.760
Jeez.

38:04.891 --> 38:07.285
Real quick, he's
deteriorating at such

38:07.415 --> 38:08.416
a different rate than us.

38:08.547 --> 38:09.809
I'm sorry.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.047
I really don't mean
to be difficult. It's

38:11.071 --> 38:12.681
my last question, I promise.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.728
But do you happen to have
aThanksgiving dinner for nine?

38:15.858 --> 38:19.514
Have you guys ever seenthat
Ethan Hawke movie, where

38:19.645 --> 38:21.085
those people get
trapped in the Andes

38:21.124 --> 38:23.344
and then they have
to eat their friends?

38:23.475 --> 38:26.478
It's pretty messed up andgross,
but they had some time

38:26.608 --> 38:28.958
to mull it over, because
the Andes is basically

38:29.089 --> 38:31.657
like a big-ass refrigerator.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.267
This cave isn't.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.704
So sooner or later,
we're going to have

38:35.835 --> 38:39.839
to make a hard choice
aboutwhat to do with that body.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.710
She's right.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.190
Brandon's getting ripe.

38:43.321 --> 38:43.843
Ew.

38:43.973 --> 38:47.194
Jesus Christ.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.067
He's not a piece
of fruit, people.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.156
I think you need
to all take a very

38:53.287 --> 38:56.203
long, hard look at yourselves.

39:03.689 --> 39:07.519
At least he's not
part of the group.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.758
I mean, it wouldn't be likewe
were eating a colleague.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.785
So it's OK even astranger,
just not your mom?

39:12.915 --> 39:15.831
I'm not saying it's
OK to eat anyone.

39:15.962 --> 39:18.660
But yes, I'd rather eat aguy
I just met who I thought

39:18.791 --> 39:20.401
was an asshole than my mom.

39:20.532 --> 39:21.576
Same.

39:21.707 --> 39:26.494
I actually do know him a little.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.192
Kind of got together with him.

39:29.323 --> 39:32.021
When he came to the officeat
that meet and greet,

39:32.152 --> 39:33.588
we went out for pizza.

39:33.719 --> 39:34.719
One thing led to another.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.725
Sex.

39:39.855 --> 39:43.076
So I sort of feel like
maybe it would be nice

39:43.206 --> 39:46.558
for us to not eat him, please.

39:50.649 --> 39:53.042
Look, I don't
think that's a valid

39:53.173 --> 39:55.305
proprietorial relationship.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.089
Why?

39:56.219 --> 39:57.003
What do you mean?

39:57.133 --> 39:57.830
You fucked my lunch.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
So what?

39:59.048 --> 40:00.528
I don't care who fucked him.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.835
I'm eating even before
heturns into a pile of goo.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.097
I'm with you.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.142
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.492
Hold up.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.146
We need to make this
decision as a team,

40:10.277 --> 40:13.541
and there's no I.
There's no I in team.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.282
Yeah, but if you swap
the letters around,

40:15.413 --> 40:16.979
it spells "meat."

40:17.110 --> 40:21.419
We are going to be rescued.

40:21.549 --> 40:25.379
And is that how you want tobe
discovered, with Brandon's

40:25.510 --> 40:27.294
ear hanging out of your mouth?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.818
I thought of everything, guys.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.518
I'm sorry, but that
place is bullshit.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.302
So what did I miss?

40:35.433 --> 40:39.219
Guys, Brandon's a human being.

40:39.349 --> 40:43.571
He has a family, and
friends, and feelings.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.705
I mean, I know that thisis
a desperate situation,

40:46.835 --> 40:53.842
but if we lose our humanity,
we've lost everything.

40:53.973 --> 40:54.973
Let's take a vote.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.196
Who's in for eating Brandon?

41:06.246 --> 41:07.366
Wait, what are we voting on?

41:07.421 --> 41:08.466
Seriously?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.297
Somebody give me a hand.

41:14.428 --> 41:15.647
I'm out.

41:15.777 --> 41:19.346
Hey, Brandon,
buddy, I'm so sorry.

41:19.477 --> 41:24.307
If you can see this from heaven,
just know that we all love you.

41:24.438 --> 41:25.700
What the fuck?

41:25.831 --> 41:27.006
(GRUNTING)

41:27.136 --> 41:29.965
He's only got one arm.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.750
Someone's stolen an arm.

41:37.407 --> 41:41.020
Who's got themselves a
nice little snacky arm?

41:43.718 --> 41:46.416
Who looks the fullest?

41:46.547 --> 41:47.766
You do.

41:47.896 --> 41:48.896
Huh?

41:54.381 --> 41:56.470
Who's been munching
on some finger food.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.996
How about you, queen bee?

42:01.127 --> 42:01.823
Huh?

42:01.954 --> 42:03.085
What about me?

42:09.352 --> 42:10.832
Be my guest.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.163
I don't have anything to hide.

42:22.017 --> 42:23.410
What?

42:23.541 --> 42:26.979
You just back the fuck off.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.807
This is an invasion of privacy.

42:33.855 --> 42:36.162
(RATTLING)

42:38.294 --> 42:40.122
(GRUNTS)

42:43.735 --> 42:46.999
(MUSIC PLAYING)

43:00.490 --> 43:04.973
Here it is, the smoking arm.

43:05.104 --> 43:06.714
Lucy.

43:06.845 --> 43:08.498
She stole it.

43:08.629 --> 43:11.240
She's been feasting on freshmeat
while we've been starving?

43:11.371 --> 43:13.416
So that's why you didn'twant
us to eat Brandon.

43:13.547 --> 43:15.157
You wanted to keep
him all to yourself?

43:15.288 --> 43:16.637
You sick fuck.

43:16.768 --> 43:19.031
I fed and watered Brandon.

43:19.161 --> 43:21.207
I bought him a burrito, OK?

43:21.337 --> 43:22.488
His nutrients should be mine.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.036
Well, you've had your share.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.559
The rest of him is ours.

43:25.690 --> 43:29.302
Jesus fucking Christ.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.086
The caving permit.

43:31.217 --> 43:33.828
Oh, no, no, the caving permitthat
you said that you filed

43:33.959 --> 43:35.613
with the ranger
station, the caving

43:35.743 --> 43:38.063
permit that you couldn't
havefiled with the ranger station

43:38.137 --> 43:40.052
because I'm holding
in my fucking hand.

43:40.182 --> 43:41.967
How could you?

43:42.097 --> 43:43.925
Oh, shit.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.318
Oh shit, shit.

43:45.448 --> 43:46.928
No one knows we're here.

43:47.059 --> 43:48.364
No one's coming to see us.

43:48.495 --> 43:50.323
I hate you, Lucy.

43:50.453 --> 43:51.977
I really fucking hate you.

43:52.107 --> 43:54.370
Why did you say
you handed it in?

43:54.501 --> 43:57.896
I thought that I had.

43:58.026 --> 44:00.115
I... I must have
gotten side tracked

44:00.246 --> 44:03.075
when I was helping you with... with
the boulders, and then I...

44:03.205 --> 44:06.034
I was looking for some
ass-wiping material,

44:06.165 --> 44:07.340
and I found it.

44:07.470 --> 44:10.952
I was trying to
protect you, and it's

44:11.083 --> 44:13.302
just been so much pressure.

44:13.433 --> 44:16.523
And look, I then made
an executive decision,

44:16.654 --> 44:19.657
because if you knew that
I hadn't, you guys...

44:19.787 --> 44:21.702
It would have just
gotten... gotten weird.

44:21.833 --> 44:22.572
You fucked us.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.662
You fucked us all.

44:24.792 --> 44:30.145
That is exactly what
I was talking about.

44:30.276 --> 44:34.149
Somebody is going
to find the tour bus

44:34.280 --> 44:35.498
and... and a yellow Porsche.

44:35.629 --> 44:36.954
How could they... how
could they miss it?

44:36.978 --> 44:38.347
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert.

44:38.371 --> 44:38.850
No one's going to see
that yellow Porsche.

44:38.980 --> 44:40.547
OK, wait.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.810
Everybody calm down, OK?

44:42.941 --> 44:45.160
Even though Lucy
super fucked us,

44:45.291 --> 44:46.988
we still need to focus
on staying alive.

44:47.119 --> 44:51.210
And all we can doright now is eat Brandon,

44:51.340 --> 44:52.646
so I suggest we eat Brandon.

44:57.042 --> 45:00.306
Who wants first bite?

45:00.436 --> 45:02.612
Fuck it, I'll do it.

45:02.743 --> 45:05.790
I'll do it.

45:05.920 --> 45:06.920
Here, give it to me.

45:13.798 --> 45:15.625
(CHEWING)

45:18.628 --> 45:20.195
Does it tastes like chicken?

45:20.326 --> 45:21.326
No.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.114
OK.

45:26.245 --> 45:29.596
It's chewy it's
definitely a chewy...

45:29.727 --> 45:31.598
A chewy dish.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.557
(THUD)

45:34.688 --> 45:37.996
(MUSIC PLAYING)

45:41.608 --> 45:43.436
(GRUNTING)

46:00.975 --> 46:04.674
Why go to all the troubleof
putting me in a prison when

46:04.805 --> 46:06.807
we're already all in a prison?

46:06.938 --> 46:09.375
We're putting you in prisonbecause
you're a damn criminal

46:09.505 --> 46:12.378
and you deserve to be punished.

46:12.508 --> 46:15.555
Well, it's totalbullshit, because I could

46:15.685 --> 46:17.557
get out whenever I wanted.

46:17.687 --> 46:20.690
No, you can't, because
we won't let you.

46:20.821 --> 46:24.042
Yeah, this is ametaphorical
cage in addition

46:24.172 --> 46:25.478
to being an actual cage.

46:29.395 --> 46:31.614
It was just a part of an arm.

46:31.745 --> 46:34.400
God.

46:34.530 --> 46:36.489
Somebody had to be
the meat pioneer.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.578
Right, and it had to be you.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.928
It always has to be you.

46:41.059 --> 46:44.323
At least I showed
some restraint.

46:44.453 --> 46:48.370
You little piggies ain't enoughof
Brandon to last us a month,

46:48.501 --> 46:49.894
you greedy fucks.

46:53.723 --> 46:58.337
So how are you feeling
post eating Brandon?

46:58.467 --> 47:03.951
Full, partially of Brandon,
mostly of self-loathing.

47:04.082 --> 47:06.388
Yeah, that was pretty gnarly.

47:06.519 --> 47:07.519
Yeah.

47:10.175 --> 47:11.350
FREDDIE: What the fuck.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.220
JESS: Holy shit.

47:12.351 --> 47:12.960
SUZY: What was that?

47:13.091 --> 47:13.961
DEREK: Goddamn.

47:14.092 --> 47:14.832
What the hell is happening.

47:14.962 --> 47:16.790
Maybe the battery died.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.705
Does anybody have
aflashlight on their phone

47:18.836 --> 47:19.924
or a headlamp that works?

47:20.054 --> 47:21.054
Shit.

47:21.099 --> 47:22.404
Please, please, please.

47:22.535 --> 47:23.188
(ZAPPING)

47:23.318 --> 47:23.928
Fuck.

47:24.058 --> 47:26.495
JESS: Oh my god.

47:26.626 --> 47:29.847
MAY: Oh, thank god.

47:29.977 --> 47:31.936
Oh, I guess you dickheads didn't

47:32.066 --> 47:35.113
take care of your headlamps.

47:35.243 --> 47:36.462
Hey.

47:36.592 --> 47:37.592
No prisoner property.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.465
I'm confiscating that.

47:39.595 --> 47:40.596
Watch the hair.

47:40.727 --> 47:41.467
Hey.

47:41.597 --> 47:42.597
Ah!

47:42.685 --> 47:43.904
Hey, how much battery is left?

47:44.035 --> 47:44.774
How long does it have?

47:44.905 --> 47:46.037
No idea.

47:46.167 --> 47:49.867
Guys, I have something
that might help.

47:54.001 --> 47:56.917
It's a wearable kinetic charger.

47:57.048 --> 47:58.484
A what?

47:58.614 --> 48:00.462
It's like one of
thoseshake-to-shine flashlights.

48:00.486 --> 48:03.619
It transfers my armmovements
into electricity.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.491
Wow.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.667
Great stuff, Aidan.

48:07.797 --> 48:11.279
Where did you get that?

48:11.410 --> 48:13.760
It comes in handy
when you're traveling.

48:13.891 --> 48:17.198
You mean like when you'rein a hotel
room, beating off?

48:17.329 --> 48:20.506
Well, yeah.

48:20.636 --> 48:22.987
It's called the Wankband.

48:23.117 --> 48:24.771
OK.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.054
Guys, personally,
I don't lovethe idea of watching Aidan rub

48:27.078 --> 48:28.644
himself stupid just
to give us enough

48:28.775 --> 48:32.692
light to watch ourselves
die of starvation.

48:32.822 --> 48:35.738
Do you have a better idea?

48:35.869 --> 48:37.175
Yeah.

48:37.305 --> 48:40.134
I think we should try
the tunnel Aidan found.

48:40.265 --> 48:42.441
(CLATTERING)

48:42.571 --> 48:45.052
You ever heard the expression,
when you're in a hole,

48:45.183 --> 48:46.706
stop digging?

48:46.836 --> 48:49.665
It's better to go furtherdown
than just stay up here.

48:49.796 --> 48:52.320
No, it's clearly worse.

48:52.451 --> 48:54.496
What could be worse than this?

48:54.627 --> 48:57.717
Imagine this, but also you're...

48:57.847 --> 48:58.674
You're dead.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.111
OK.

49:00.241 --> 49:02.417
Guys, if we don't try to
find a way out of here,

49:02.548 --> 49:04.332
we're all going to die.

49:04.463 --> 49:06.247
Now, I'm going down there.

49:06.378 --> 49:08.597
Who's going with me?

49:08.728 --> 49:09.728
I can't.

49:09.772 --> 49:12.862
I'm all lupused out.

49:12.993 --> 49:14.386
I'll go.

49:14.516 --> 49:15.778
Great.

49:15.909 --> 49:17.191
Yeah, this is the
right thing to do.

49:17.215 --> 49:20.870
Yeah, take some action,
maximize our odds.

49:21.001 --> 49:22.022
We're going to
need the headlamp.

49:22.046 --> 49:22.611
Fuck that.

49:22.742 --> 49:24.439
Finders keepers.

49:24.570 --> 49:26.461
All right, then you keep
theheadlamp and then come with us.

49:26.485 --> 49:27.485
Fuck that.

49:30.315 --> 49:34.275
Listen, you probablydon't
know this about me,

49:34.406 --> 49:37.670
but I was married once.

49:37.800 --> 49:40.020
My wife's name was Claire.

49:40.151 --> 49:42.501
She died.

49:42.631 --> 49:45.504
I remember cleaning outthis
closet after she died

49:45.634 --> 49:49.029
and finding this beach ball.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.206
I remembered it was
Claire who blew it up.

49:52.337 --> 49:55.862
I got rid of everything
that reminded me of her.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.908
It was just too painful.

49:59.039 --> 50:04.392
But one thing I couldn'tget
rid of was that ball.

50:04.523 --> 50:08.657
I still have it,
because Claire's breath

50:08.788 --> 50:10.746
is still in there.

50:10.877 --> 50:14.054
And as long as there's
breath in my body,

50:14.185 --> 50:16.491
and Claire's breath
is in that beach ball,

50:16.622 --> 50:21.714
I'm going to find us
a way out of here, OK?

50:21.844 --> 50:24.108
And I need your help.

50:24.238 --> 50:25.848
You should do it, Billy.

50:25.979 --> 50:27.459
Yeah, Billy.

50:27.589 --> 50:29.749
It'd actually be nice to
take a little break from you.

50:29.809 --> 50:32.203
You've been nothing but
amoaning drain on all of us

50:32.333 --> 50:33.333
since we got down here.

50:36.207 --> 50:37.207
Wow.

50:41.038 --> 50:41.690
OK.

50:41.821 --> 50:45.303
Here, take it.

50:45.433 --> 50:46.826
But you're not going with me.

50:46.956 --> 50:48.436
Oh, wow.

50:48.567 --> 50:49.872
Great, yeah.

50:50.003 --> 50:51.700
Just maybe put some clothes on.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.093
Uh-huh.

50:53.224 --> 50:56.009
For Claire.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.619
Wow, that was amazing.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.360
Thanks.

50:59.491 --> 51:01.710
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

51:01.841 --> 51:03.081
I didn't know you were married.

51:03.147 --> 51:05.062
Also, you must have
been super young.

51:05.192 --> 51:07.673
Yeah.

51:07.803 --> 51:11.198
Actually, that was quote.

51:11.329 --> 51:12.112
What?

51:12.243 --> 51:12.982
A quote.

51:13.113 --> 51:14.158
What?

51:14.288 --> 51:16.334
Oh, the speech,
it's from CSI New

51:16.464 --> 51:18.727
York season one episode one.

51:18.858 --> 51:19.858
OK.

51:19.946 --> 51:21.295
But it worked though, right?

51:21.426 --> 51:22.731
Yeah, yeah.

51:22.862 --> 51:24.472
Totally.

51:24.603 --> 51:26.474
Good old Gary Sinise.

51:26.605 --> 51:28.563
Hey, listen.

51:28.694 --> 51:32.959
Thank you, you know, for
having my back just now

51:33.090 --> 51:35.440
and just, I don't
know, being awesome

51:35.570 --> 51:38.007
through this whole experience.

51:38.138 --> 51:40.706
I think we make a
pretty good team.

51:40.836 --> 51:42.273
Wow.

51:42.403 --> 51:44.753
Is this... is this
friendshipright now happening?

51:44.884 --> 51:45.624
Oh, yeah, it is.

51:45.754 --> 51:46.842
OK, cool.

51:46.973 --> 51:48.931
Yeah, it's weird, a good weird.

51:49.062 --> 51:49.758
Yeah.

51:49.889 --> 51:50.672
It's a good weird.

51:50.803 --> 51:51.325
Friend request sent.

51:51.456 --> 51:52.283
Oh, got it.

51:52.413 --> 51:53.893
Accept.

51:54.023 --> 51:57.549
Hey, you two lovebirds,
don't hold back on my account.

51:57.679 --> 52:00.204
What the... that's not
what's happening here.

52:00.334 --> 52:01.901
It's so not what's
happening right now.

52:02.031 --> 52:03.381
Besides, he's got
Brandon breath.

52:03.511 --> 52:04.619
- Really?
- It's totally fine.

52:04.643 --> 52:05.643
I have it, too.

52:05.687 --> 52:06.253
We just ate, like, a whole dude.

52:06.384 --> 52:07.384
OK.

52:09.952 --> 52:13.260
(MUSIC PLAYING)

52:38.067 --> 52:39.067
Oh, OK, guys.

52:39.112 --> 52:40.192
Definitely don't look down.

I doing up here?

52:54.171 --> 52:54.910
I'm not a hero.

52:55.041 --> 52:56.434
I'm a cowardly asshole.

Uh, there's a ledge andl'm
going to have to jump,

53:04.355 --> 53:06.531
so should I jump?

53:06.661 --> 53:08.010
Yeah.

53:08.141 --> 53:09.597

it's safe to drink.

It's cave water.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.448
So?

53:54.579 --> 53:56.407
So what do you think
Evian's made from?

53:56.537 --> 53:58.670
Pure delicious cave water.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.759
This its purest in the

canregenerate in our bellies,

54:32.747 --> 54:33.618
because they can regenerate.

54:33.748 --> 54:35.794

It was before you and I

I'm sorry.

55:21.709 --> 55:23.842
If Brandon wasn't crushedto
death by those rocks,

55:23.972 --> 55:26.235
would you still be
sleeping with him?

55:26.366 --> 55:31.371
Are you asking me to choosebetween
you and the man I spent

55:31.502 --> 55:35.244
one night with and then ate?

thekind of person I can have

You're being really needy.

I'm not being needy.

I just don't think you've
beencompletely honest and open

because there are reminders

55:48.780 --> 55:50.216
of Brandon everywhere.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.567
You don't think
it's hard for me?

I'm telling you rightnow,
sleeping with someone

55:56.309 --> 55:58.920
and then eating them,
it's not nothing.

happening right now?

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:03.301
But if I die, Lucy is
not allowed to eat me.

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:05.520
What do you care?

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:06.651
You'd be dead.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:16.401
OK, I am hereby making
an official legal will.

01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:22.102
Everybody apart from Lucy
isallowed to eat me if I die.

01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:24.496
Not even a finger?

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:27.455
Jess, you get first
pick of my parts.

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:31.111
You always watch out for me,
and I've always liked you.

01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:33.505
OK, thanks.

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:35.333
Just tell me what
part you want and I'll

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:37.770
put your name next to it.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:41.382
Why don't you pick, you know?

01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:42.949
Surprise me.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.213
If Jess doesn't wantit,
can I get an asscheek?

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:50.043
I really don't mind whichone,
but if I had to choose,

01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:51.305
I'd say lefty.

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:52.263
Hey, good choice.

01:03:52.393 --> 01:03:53.481
Freddie gets second pick.

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:55.788
I don't give a shit.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:04:00.837
Well, not the response
I was hoping for.

01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:06.451
Listen, I've been
on a vision quest.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:09.454
I've seen through theother
end of the telescope.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:12.500
I've looked at the other
side of the potato.

01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:14.372
And you know what I learned?

01:04:14.502 --> 01:04:18.289
That this company is bullshit,
and you can all shove my Edible.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:20.291
Cutlery up your assholes.

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:23.337
We're all just eyelashes
on the face of God.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:26.123
OK, whatever.

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:29.082
Maybe we should try
drinking our own piss.

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:31.780
Huh?

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.305
What would happen if
we drank our own piss?

01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:36.524
We'd still die,
but the last thing we'd taste

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:37.656
would be our own piss.

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:44.271
Hey.

01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:45.640
Hey, prisoner leaving theprison
area, what are you doing?

01:04:45.664 --> 01:04:46.664
Get back in there.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.892
OK.

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:57.806
I don't want to be
the voice of doom.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:05:02.594
But I think that Gloria'snot
looking too good.

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.901
Lady Gaga has lupus.

01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:07.729
If she has it, it
can't be that bad.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.122
I don't think so.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.645
What is your point?

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:11.908
OK.

01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:16.303
My point is are we
going to just sit

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:18.436
here and wait for
her to die, or are

01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:21.221
we going to speed things up?

01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:23.745
You mean like with the...

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:26.139
Like hitting her with a rock?

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:30.230
That's horrible, no.

01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:32.841
I was thinking more like
a coat over the face.

01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:35.279
My god.

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:35.932
Jesus.

01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:38.282
What?

01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:40.632
It's good, right?

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:43.461
This is all I could muster.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:44.810
Anybody want some?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.551
No, thank you.

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.596
I'm good.

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:49.858
I'm not there yet.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.252
But an asscheek
and a swig of this,

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:54.863
and won't be no
talking on both jaws.

01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:55.994
What?

01:05:58.432 --> 01:06:00.217
Even got some fizz to it.

01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:01.696
Hard pass.

01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:02.567
More for me.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:03.698
You're still peeing?

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:07.093
I haven't peed in three days.

01:06:07.224 --> 01:06:08.399
Poems, oh.

01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:09.139
Hey.

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:10.401
Look at this.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:11.769
Gloria's been writing
fucking poetry.

01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:12.664
Give me that.

01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:13.317
That's private.

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:15.580
Hold on.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:20.193
My plight has given me wealthmore
important than my health.

01:06:20.324 --> 01:06:24.763
Trapped in this cavern of doom,
I have found some psychic room.

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:29.986
When I feel the darkness call,
I see God's face on the wall.

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:31.596
Which wall is that, Gloria?

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.661
Is that the one that Derektook
a giant shit against?

01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:36.862
OK, well, it's a
first draft, so...

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.153
Poetry is not a crime, Billy.

01:06:38.255 --> 01:06:39.362
Give her back her
fucking notebook.

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:40.170
Uh-huh.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.433
Shit, hold on now.

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:45.740
I hereby give permissionfor
posthumous publication

01:06:45.871 --> 01:06:47.351
of these poems.

01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:51.790
You're going to publish,
make money off our deaths?

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.574
That's for my girls.

01:06:53.705 --> 01:06:54.987
I just want to leave
them something.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.751
Fuck those little assholes.

01:06:56.882 --> 01:06:58.492
They're seven and nine.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:02.931
Well, I refuse to
bememorialized by shitty poetry.

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:04.368
It's embarrassing.

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:06.979
Like, who uses rhyming
couplets anymore?

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.589
If you hate it so
much, why don't you

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.330
write your own fucking poetry?

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:11.723
You know what?

01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:15.292
How about the punishment
for writing bad poetry

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:18.556
should be that we kill
Gloria and eat her?

01:07:18.686 --> 01:07:20.732
Jesus Christ.

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.560
You've lost your fucking mind.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.779
No, this is survival
of the fittest.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.520
Survival of the fittest doesn't

01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:27.782
mean killing the unfittest.

01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:30.046
Nobody is killing anyone.

01:07:30.176 --> 01:07:31.786
If we die, we die together.

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:35.573
What's wrong with one of
usdying to save the rest of us?

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.445
As long as the one
who dies isn't you.

01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:40.969
I mean, I'll freely
admit that if one of us

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.189
dies I am going to eat
them in a heartbeat.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.799
But what you suggesting is...

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.386
There's crossing the lineand
then there's smashing

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.673
through it with a truck.

01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:49.891
I get it.

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:52.024
Not everyone has
balls big enough

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:54.461
to make the hard decisions.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:55.941
That's what leaders do.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.508
It's the white man's burden.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:08:00.163
Oh, so you're a white
man now, Acama queen?

01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:03.818
I wear many hats.

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:06.952
I know why you
want to eat Gloria.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.346
It's because you're a vampire.

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:12.871
You've been sucking my bloodfor
years, but all of that

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:13.741
stops now.

01:08:13.872 --> 01:08:15.613
That is bullshit.

01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:21.096
You wanted a sexy as
helltough as nails lady boss,

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:23.229
and you just couldn't handle it.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.274
OK, fine.

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:26.841
It's true.

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.558
I didn't have the confidenceto
make my idea work.

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:29.627
You did.

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:31.063
And you know what?

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:33.631
I liked it when you fucked me.

01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:38.201
Yeah, I even liked it
whenyou put things up my ass

01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:39.984
occasionally.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:44.337
But when I stopped liking it and
I asked you to stop doing it,

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:48.863
you carried on, and
that's not OK, Lucy.

01:08:48.993 --> 01:08:53.651
And I'm not going to
let you do it anymore.

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:58.308
Fuck you and fuck this company.

01:08:58.438 --> 01:08:59.787
I resign.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:03.791
I'm going to stop
workingand start knitting.

01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:05.444
Knitting?

01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.707
Just because I'm a guydoesn't
mean I can't knit, OK?

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:08.926
OK.

01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:10.122
I'm going to knit
the most amazing

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.669
sweater you've ever seen.

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:13.323
Freddie's right.

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:15.455
You have some major
boundary issues.

01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.706
You guys know that shethreatened
to fire me because I

01:09:17.761 --> 01:09:19.154
turned off my
phone for two hours

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:20.765
while I attended my
grandma's funeral?

01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:23.898
I was hosting my bestfriend's
bachelorette party,

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:26.118
and we needed a patio
heater delivered.

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:27.877
I mean, do you know howcold
it was when the patio?

01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:31.993
It is not my job to keepyou
cold-ass friends warm.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:36.781
You... you break my heart.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:39.783
I mentored you because
I wanted a little

01:09:39.913 --> 01:09:43.701
of the light that's alwaysshined
on me to reflect on you.

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:46.399
When I found out your momdied
when you were so young,

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:49.359
I decided to be the
mom that you never had.

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:50.229
What the fuck?

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:51.970
It was never enough.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.974
You just wanted more, more, more.
You and your fucking MBA,

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:57.671
he didn't want to be my mentee.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.543
You didn't want to work for me.

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:01.849
No, you wanted to replace me.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.914
I don't want to be in yourshadow
for the rest of my life.

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.027
Is that a crime?

01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:08.682
You need to get real.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:09.814
Would you be without me?

01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:13.600
Not in this fucking cave, Lucy.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:19.824
Do you know when I
hiredyou, and you, and you,

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:25.395
and you, and you, I stepped up?

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:29.268
I gave you an opportunityof a lifetime.

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:33.620
And yes, there was some
sweet, sweet grant money

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.796
from the minorities
and business agency,

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:38.712
but that was just a bonus.

01:10:38.843 --> 01:10:43.587
I did this for all of you asa
gift, a gift from my heart.

01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:46.372
You never gave us anything, OK?

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:49.897
We all worked really
hardto get to where we are.

01:10:50.028 --> 01:10:54.946
Two words, affirmative action.

01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:56.556
Do you want to be a quota queen?

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.992
Is that what you want?

01:10:58.123 --> 01:11:00.256
Because you better
start asking yourself,

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:04.912
who am I when I'm notblack
and I'm not a woman?

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:09.308
Who am I and what
do I have to give?

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:11.832
You know what?

01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:13.530
It's people like
you think you're

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.402
part of the solution when
you'rethe whole fucking problem.

01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:17.813
And on top of
that, your opinions

01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:20.014
are bad you're a huge asshole.

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.886
In fact, the only
good idea you ever had

01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:23.907
was Freddie's,
and the onlything you'll ever be famous

01:11:23.931 --> 01:11:26.040
for is for the fact that you
ateour dead spelunking instructor.

01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:28.632
Don't you talk to
your mother that way.

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:29.589
You're not my mother.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.156
Yes I am.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.071
FREDDIE: Get the fuck off her!

01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:37.293
Fuck.

01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:38.423
Oh my god.

01:11:46.606 --> 01:11:47.651
Oh my god.

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:48.956
Oh, god.

01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:49.783
I'm sorry, Lucy.

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:53.221
I didn't mean to... no, Lucy.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:55.136
I'm so sorry.

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:56.747
I'm sorry.

01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:11.979
What the hell is that?

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.894
Britney?

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:16.070
Is that you, Britney?

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.420
Is that a drill?

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:18.682
Oh my god, it is.

01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:20.031
It's a drill!

01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:22.860

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.560
BILLY: Hey, Hey, we're in here.

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:28.866
Freddie.

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:29.996
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:39.572
I'm going to rat you
out, you manslaughterer.

01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:45.752
You're going to
die alone in jail.

01:12:45.883 --> 01:12:46.883
You pussy.

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:51.279
What's up?

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:52.410
Is she dead?

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.415
What?

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.069
She says she's
going to tell the cops

01:12:58.199 --> 01:12:59.679
that I tried to kill her.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:00.637
I'm going to go to jail.

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:01.638
No.

01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:02.552
I'm going to die in jail.

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:03.770
No.

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:04.728
OK, you were trying
to protect me.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:05.879
She's a fucking sociopath.

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:07.470
Let's just say that she tripped.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.664
What if they send a cracksquad
of forensic investigators

01:13:08.688 --> 01:13:10.081
with black lights?

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:11.667
This is exactly the kindof
case that a crack squad

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:13.060
of forensic investigators
with black lights

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:14.148
would solve within seconds.

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.279
They're not going to do that.

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:16.522
This isn't CSI.

01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:19.656
All you have to do
is relax, OK, and not

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:22.006
tell them the whole
truthabout what happened.

01:13:22.136 --> 01:13:23.921
I can't lie to the police.

01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:25.662
They'll never believe me.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:26.576
OK.

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:29.883
Everybody, listen up.

01:13:30.014 --> 01:13:31.450
All right?

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.167
When the rescuers get
downhere, she's going to try

01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:35.149
and get Freddie arrested.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.360
We need to make sure
thatFreddie knows that he's not

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.023
alone, OK, that we're
not going to let

01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:40.193
him take the rap for this.

01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:45.725
We need to finish
what he started.

01:13:45.856 --> 01:13:47.118
I wasn't trying to kill her.

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:50.730
It's OK, I got this.

01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:53.254

01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:10.315
I didn't mean for
you to hit your head.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.099
I just didn't want
you to hurt Jess.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.320
And I... I know I know I saidsome
horrible things about you,

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.496
but you're a good person.

01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:21.718
I mean, you're
not, but you were.

01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:24.503
We had some good times,
right, in the early days,

01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:26.897
like that... like the
trip to Sausalito?

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:28.333
Remember?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.944
We ate the clam chowder
in the bread bowls.

01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:35.819
They served soup in bowls madeout of
bread, and we ate it.

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:39.605
The soup, the bowl,
the whole damn thing.

01:14:39.736 --> 01:14:42.739

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:50.007
It's too heavy.

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:52.357
You guys, what about
Brandon's walking pole?

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.314
Yes.

01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:54.272
Actually, that's perfect.

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.708
We can use it as a lever.

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:58.711
And it's metal, so it
won't snap this time.

01:14:58.842 --> 01:15:02.019
That's what gave me theidea
for the Edible Cutlery.

01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:03.760
Yeah.

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:06.676
I mean, if you can eat a bowl,
why not a spoon, you know?

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:09.635
Lucy, if you hadn't taken meto
Sausalito on company money

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:12.420
to fuck my brains
out, I never would

01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:14.597
have eaten the bread
bowl, and I never would

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.903
have thought of the spoons.

I want to say
something about Lucy.

Lucy, Lucy was the most
amazingwoman and inspiring leader

I've ever known.

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:33.681

all, she taught us

01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.335
how to work together as a team.

Don't say it.

01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:47.434
It was really tragic.

01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:51.395

fell on her sucked.

down celebrating

01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:03.450
and the rock was worked
loose by the drilling,

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:05.235
and then it just fell.

playing the blame game.
