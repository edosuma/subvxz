WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.045
We can't wait for Tomika.

00:04.129 --> 00:07.924
I want to go over where we are
with Operation Mick Bronson.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.968
Mr. Finn, please start the slideshow.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.889
This is a photo from our last meeting,
two weeks ago,

00:14.973 --> 00:18.601
when I said "we only have 16 days
to get our music to Mick Bronson,"

00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
and it's as though nothing has changed!

00:22.689 --> 00:25.817
If we don't get on his online playlist,
we're going to have to wait another year

00:25.900 --> 00:27.068
for rock super stardom!

00:27.152 --> 00:32.532
365 days? I was already supposed
to be broken up with Selena Gomez by then!

00:32.949 --> 00:36.244
To get to the next level,
we need to be on Mick's Picks now.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.789
People who are on it get famous.
This is their future.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.166
Next slide.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.544
[all] Whoa!

00:45.211 --> 00:48.673
People who aren't good enough
for the list are never heard from again.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.341
This is their future.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.387
Whoa...

00:56.014 --> 00:58.433
What, I love hotdogs! Is that a crime?

00:59.601 --> 01:02.187
The point is, if we don't get
on Mick's Picks,

01:02.270 --> 01:04.689
there will be no other path
for us to break out.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.650
You know, we might as well give up. Slide.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.781
That's not the right slide!

01:14.532 --> 01:17.368
[Finn] Oh, my slides must have gotten
mixed up with yours.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.872
That's me and my buddy, Scabs,
bungee jumping off of Barton Creek Bridge.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.042
That's us standing next to a sign

01:24.125 --> 01:26.461
that says "No Bungee Jumping Off
Barton Creek Bridge."

01:27.086 --> 01:30.215
Are there any photos of you not puking?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.549
Well, let me look.

01:31.925 --> 01:36.846
Puke... puke... puke... puke...
puke... puke... puke...

01:36.930 --> 01:38.473
Man, that was a great trip!

01:39.724 --> 01:41.851
Can we get back to Mick Bronson?

01:42.143 --> 01:43.603
-Uh, yeah.
-Ahem!

01:45.605 --> 01:47.106
I'm looking for my rock.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.319
Well, you've come
to the right place because we rock!

01:51.986 --> 01:57.200
-Are you done?
-Not yet. Rock! Okay, now I'm done.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.287
I need my lucky rock. And so do you guys,
if you ever want

02:01.371 --> 02:02.705
to get our music to Mick Bronson.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.334
Aren't you being a little superstitious
about your rock?

02:06.417 --> 02:11.089
No, you don't get it! Ever since
I found Lucy, my life's been amazing!

02:11.172 --> 02:13.800
I got a new skateboard,
my mom increased my TV time,

02:13.883 --> 02:16.469
and my brother got a green bean
stuck up his nose!

02:16.719 --> 02:18.638
You can't argue with science.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.890
Ahem!

02:21.057 --> 02:24.435
If anyone finds a rock
that looks like-- a rock,

02:24.519 --> 02:30.275
and answers to the name "Lucy," please,
I just want her back. No questions asked.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.944
I'm pretty sure I'll have questions.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.990
Guys! What part of "ahem" don't you get?

02:38.324 --> 02:42.245
I have a delightfully Lawrence solution
to our Mick Bronson problem.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.630
I built a catapult that can launch things
over Mick Bronson's gate using suction.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.842
I call it the "Suck And Chuck 9000."

02:55.925 --> 02:59.262
It's not patented yet, so I'd appreciate
no one stealing the name.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.555
I think you're good.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.308
How does it work?

03:03.641 --> 03:07.478
I just feed these flash drives
of our music into the Suck And Chuck 9000,

03:07.562 --> 03:09.772
and they get thrown right
at Mick Bronson's front door.

03:10.106 --> 03:14.110
[Lawrence] He finds it, plays it,
and makes us stars. Voila!

03:16.696 --> 03:20.366
[loud vacuum noise]

03:29.959 --> 03:31.711
Lawrence, do something!

03:31.836 --> 03:34.714
It's okay,
I can shut it off using this remote!

03:36.674 --> 03:38.134
It's not okay!

03:42.388 --> 03:45.141
Mr. Finn, what is-- Augh!

03:48.269 --> 03:54.108
Uh, and that is why tornadoes are bad.

Okay, one of us is walking weird,
and I think it's you.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.864
I'm trying to avoid bad luck
until I get my lucky rock back.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.117
If I walk too fast, I might trip.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.952
Tomeeks, you'll be fine--

04:46.035 --> 04:47.036
-[gasping]
-What?!

04:47.412 --> 04:49.747
I stepped on a crack,
my mother's back-- what have I done?!

04:51.291 --> 04:54.085
Get away from me, I'm a walking target!

04:54.711 --> 04:59.215
Will you calm down?
This is all in your mind,

04:59.507 --> 05:01.801
you just have to think positive thoughts.

05:01.884 --> 05:05.138
[sighing] Ah-- aughh!

05:05.221 --> 05:07.056
This is what I was worried about!

05:07.223 --> 05:08.975
[screaming]

05:13.229 --> 05:15.940
See, that could have gone worse!

05:19.736 --> 05:25.366
Mick Bronson is in this city somewhere,
and I won't leave one donut shop,

05:25.450 --> 05:29.912
pie shop, or funnel cake stand unturned
until we find him.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.041
What makes you think Mick is going
to be at those places?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.918
I just like to check those first.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.964
If I had my lucky rock,
we would have found him by now.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.426
And this morning, I wouldn't have brushed
my teeth with my dad's butt cream.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.094
[cellphone beeping]

05:45.678 --> 05:46.679
I just got an alert!

05:46.763 --> 05:49.974
Mick Bronson is out scouting bands playing
in the Austin Music Festival!

05:50.058 --> 05:51.225
He's so close!

05:51.309 --> 05:53.102
If only there was a way we could get
to him!

05:53.394 --> 05:55.772
-Ahem!
-Okay, tell us, buddy, what have you got?

05:56.898 --> 06:00.359
What would you say if I told you that
I just hacked into Mick Bronson's phone?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.529
Which has access to his calendar
and his exact location.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.073
I'd say you're a genius!

06:05.156 --> 06:08.493
And I'd say thank you in seven languages,
but we don't have the time.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.915
Currently, Mick is at Pierre's Tacos
on Congress, he's having the carnitas.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.166
How do you know about the carnitas?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.751
He just posted a picture.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.711
Gotta be careful with social media,
people.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.380
You don't want strangers looking
at your carnitas.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.553
Oh, look! Tonight, Mick is going
to be checking out bands at Gooch's!

06:28.262 --> 06:31.724
If you can hack into Mick's phone,
what's to stop you from hacking into ours?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.644
-Nothing, I do it all the time.
-[all] Huh?

06:34.852 --> 06:37.647
Here's Mr. Finn's phone,
and here's his schedule.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.567
"Rock and roll all night,
and party every day?"

06:44.529 --> 06:45.780
Every day.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.373
This is the place!

06:55.706 --> 06:58.334
Okay,
let's go over the plan one more time.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.254
We go in, find Mick Bronson,
and ask him to listen to our music.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.338
Right.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.967
You really had to go over
that plan one more time?

07:06.717 --> 07:10.388
People don't let me make plans much,
so don't take this away from me.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.642
Now, put your rock star faces on.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.436
[growling]

07:17.186 --> 07:23.151
[music playing]

07:23.234 --> 07:24.235
No!

07:24.569 --> 07:27.238
Come on, we've got our rock star faces on!

07:27.488 --> 07:28.614
They're kids!

07:28.698 --> 07:31.159
I didn't just graduate bouncer school
yesterday.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.078
Outta the way, big stuff.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.373
My name is Randall,
and I have a glandular issue.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.793
I'm sure we can work out
some kind of deal.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.797
Okay, how about you leave,
and I won't damage you?

07:46.424 --> 07:49.594
That doesn't seem like a fair--
we've got a deal. Ow, ow, ow!

07:51.596 --> 07:52.930
Well, we tried.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.057
Are you going to let him talk
to you like that, Mr. Finn?

07:55.183 --> 07:57.643
Yes, do you see how big he is?!

07:57.852 --> 07:59.228
Which is totally glandular.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.319
There's gotta be some way we can get
in here without Mr. Finn chickening out!

08:06.402 --> 08:07.403
Guys.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.280
But I can't think
of a plan he won't chicken out on!

08:09.363 --> 08:10.364
Guys!

08:10.448 --> 08:12.158
Oh, maybe we could use his chickening
out as a distraction!

08:12.241 --> 08:14.869
-We'll call it Operation Coward!
-Guys!

08:15.953 --> 08:17.955
Wait, that chauffeur is holding
a sign that says "Mick."

08:18.498 --> 08:20.875
I think I have a plan,
and Mr. Finn doesn't even have

08:20.958 --> 08:23.044
-to chicken out!
-Oh, but he probably will.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.337
Guys!

08:27.423 --> 08:29.258
What would it take to get us
into that limo?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.384
How much you got?

08:30.635 --> 08:34.305
I got some chocolate covered raisins
in my pocket. They're a little linty.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.098
Get in.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.946
There he is!
Who's ready to rock this limo?!

08:50.071 --> 08:51.989
-[all] Yeah!
-[thudding]

08:52.073 --> 08:53.282
Oww!

08:59.247 --> 09:00.248
What's happening?

09:00.748 --> 09:04.752
Mick, buddy, before you freak out--
I know this isn't what you were expecting

09:04.835 --> 09:05.836
to see in your limo--

09:05.920 --> 09:09.632
Well, let's see, did I order a car full
of kids or a hot tub?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.384
Pretty sure I went with the hot tub.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.471
Well, we're something
that you'll like even more.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.056
We're a band that wants a record deal.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.183
-Oh, well, I , uhh--
-Please give us a chance,

09:19.267 --> 09:21.143
-we won't let you down.
-No, it's just that, you know, I--

Less talk, more rock. One, two, three!

09:24.272 --> 09:27.149

like we're on vacation ♪

09:27.233 --> 09:29.819

09:44.208 --> 09:46.335
-Really, you liked it?!
-Yes, I loved it!

09:46.627 --> 09:48.462
Do you think it will be good enough
to be on Mick's Picks?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.506
-Sure!
-[giggling]

09:50.631 --> 09:51.841
You guys know Mick Bronson?

09:52.883 --> 09:57.221
Uh-- uh-- Aren't you Mick Bronson?

09:57.555 --> 10:01.017
Ah, Mick-- me?! Nah, Mick Friedman,
I'm a veterinarian.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.521
But your clothes look so rock and roll.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.066
Of course! I'm a veterinarian.

10:11.485 --> 10:15.114
[Zack]
So, we just played our hearts out for--

10:15.197 --> 10:18.492
Mick Friedman,
the rock and roll doggie doctor.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.621
This is all because I lost my lucky rock.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.041
[Mick] You know, you guys should write a
song about the importance of spaying

10:25.124 --> 10:27.376
and neutering your pets, that's a hit!

10:29.170 --> 10:32.923
So that this isn't a total loss,
do you mind if I take my shirt off

10:33.007 --> 10:34.634
and scream out of your sun roof?

10:41.182 --> 10:44.143
Tomeeks, I know you lost your rock
and things haven't been going your way,

10:44.226 --> 10:45.811
but aren't you being a little paranoid?

10:46.604 --> 10:51.233
No! I'm dealing rationally with the fact
that the universe is out to get me.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.362
-You're overreacting!
-Really?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.865
I fell in a bucket of mop water,
Mick's Picks comes out tonight,

10:57.948 --> 11:01.077
and we're not in it,
and my teeth smell like my dad's butt!

11:02.536 --> 11:05.247
Well, I guess if anybody can pull
off that look, you can!

11:06.248 --> 11:08.292
You look like an adorable package.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.421
-[popping]
-Hey!

11:12.755 --> 11:15.508
Sorry, Tomika,
I don't know what came over me.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.177
[popping] Oh, that.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.097
What, hey-- Ow!

11:21.222 --> 11:23.891
-[popping]
-Back off!

11:26.560 --> 11:28.270
Can you believe these people?

11:28.771 --> 11:31.023
It is kind of irresistible.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.275
Fine, go ahead.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.445
Nope, I don't care about bubbles,
I care about you.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.907
No, I care about you.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.701
Hey, Summer, Tomika, how's it going?

11:42.910 --> 11:46.205
I'm in a bubble suit.
You can probably figure out the rest.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.708
Oh, sorry.
But things have been going great for me.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.419
Ever since I found this rock.

11:51.585 --> 11:56.215
You found a rock? What's her name?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.300
Weirdly, it hasn't come up.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.886
What's your name, my mineral friend?

12:00.970 --> 12:03.139
Lucy! I'll trade you Summer for the rock!

12:03.222 --> 12:04.557
-What?
-I'm sorry, Sum, I love you,

12:04.640 --> 12:07.435
-but I'm desperate.
-Just to be clear, I'm not on the table.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.478
Can you throw in anything else
to sweeten the deal?
