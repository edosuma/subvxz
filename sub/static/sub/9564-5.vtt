Hi. Just checking
Abi's diaphragm contractions.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.957
What the heII is going on?

16:59.720 --> 17:03.349
BuIIshit, Tony. You fucking sick...

17:03.440 --> 17:06.000

17:07.400 --> 17:09.117
Fuck you.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.349
FIuffy teddy-bear?

That's my Iucky teddy!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.319
And you can fuck off, too!

17:18.400 --> 17:21.836
WeII... MicheIIe. I'm just wondering
why you're overreacting Iike this.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.876
Overreacting?!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.757
Right in my face, you whore!

17:25.839 --> 17:28.194
You know, typicaIIy,
episodes of paranoia

17:28.280 --> 17:30.999
might be symptomatic of a wide range
of emotionaI and mentaI issues.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.310
Maybe, you know, you need
some heIp with the outbursts.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.356
My mother's a psychoIogist, she couId...

17:35.440 --> 17:37.954
Oh!

17:38.040 --> 17:41.715
Ow! I'II kiII you,
you fucking fIat-chested cocksucking

17:41.800 --> 17:44.268

17:45.920 --> 17:47.956
Woah, good swearing.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.110
Bye, Tony.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.077
Later, Nips.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.039
Abi, wonder if you couId
give me and Sid a minute.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.509
Yes... I need my medication.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.836
See, toId you it'd be worth coming for.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.717
Looks Iike me and 'CheIIe are on a break.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.109
You did that on purpose?

18:09.200 --> 18:10.713
- Go after her.
- What?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.791
Life throws up so few opportunities...

18:12.880 --> 18:14.677
But she's your girIfriend.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.832
- Who you Iove.
- What?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.399
Change. It's a wonderfuI thing.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.513
Look, you know how subatomic particIes
don't obey physicaI Iaws?

18:23.600 --> 18:27.309
They act according to chance,
chaos, coincidence...

18:27.400 --> 18:31.188
They run into each other in the middIe of
the universe, and, bang! Energy.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.431
We're the same as that.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.149
That's the great thing
about the universe. UnpredictabIe.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.719
That's why it's so much fun.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.472
I'm...just gonna go see
if she's OK, aII right?

18:44.560 --> 18:46.312
Sid. Bang!

18:55.720 --> 18:59.269
MicheIIe wouId never...

19:47.720 --> 19:48.789
Are you givin' me cheek?

19:48.880 --> 19:51.075

27:46.840 --> 27:49.513

27:49.600 --> 27:52.433
You've either got it or you don't...

27:52.520 --> 27:55.114
You haven't got it. OK?

27:55.200 --> 27:57.111

Woah! Was that MicheIIe?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.430
No, er, there were these girIs...

28:17.520 --> 28:19.351
What kind of girIs, Sid?

28:19.440 --> 28:20.998
Big ones.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.513
I thought you was hanging out with Cassie.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.160
Er... Bit of a mix up.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.673
Yeah? Like what?

28:26.760 --> 28:29.797
She was reaIIy Iooking forward to that.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.359
OK, everyone!

28:31.440 --> 28:34.671
Because you've aII given it everything,

29:10.360 --> 29:13.079
my best mate wants me to make a move
on his girIfriend, who I Iove,

29:13.160 --> 29:16.072
even though she stiII Ioves him
and now actuaIIy hates me?

29:16.160 --> 29:19.948
My Dad thinks I'm a compIete fuck-up,
and can't stop acting Iike a fuck-up

29:20.040 --> 29:23.953
and no matter what I try,
I can't stop pissing everyone off?

29:24.040 --> 29:26.270
We can sort that out, can we?

29:27.880 --> 29:31.156
OK. OK, yeah.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.993
Give me a moment to, um...

29:34.080 --> 29:36.150
Life, Sid.

29:36.240 --> 29:40.313
There are Iots of ups and downs, OK?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.719
It is Iike a...

29:41.800 --> 29:46.351
It's Iike a...bird, fIying.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.749
Find your wings, Sid.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.035
Right.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.680
And do your fucking coursework.
Otherwise you're fucked.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.557
Yeah. Thanks, Tom. That sorts it.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.279

30:22.280 --> 30:24.953

was making your move too quickIy.

30:25.040 --> 30:25.995
What?

30:26.080 --> 30:29.277

30:29.360 --> 30:30.475

30:30.560 --> 30:32.630
This is fucked up, Tone!

30:32.720 --> 30:34.870

30:34.960 --> 30:37.679

30:40.080 --> 30:41.433
But it's never duII. Is it?

30:43.040 --> 30:43.995
No.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.709
Ring her. Take her for a drink,
and see what happens.

30:47.800 --> 30:52.032
What's the worst that can happen?
It's your choice, dude. Your choice.
