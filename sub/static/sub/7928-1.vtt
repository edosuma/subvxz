WEBVTT

03:08.756 --> 03:10.691
No!

03:33.113 --> 03:36.450
How was it?
I played this
game, "Stay Alive."

03:36.484 --> 03:39.853
Seriously, man,
the sickest shit
since Fatal Frame.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.089
It was creepy.
Really creepy.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.725
Are you gonna
make it over here?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.194
Can you come over?
You wanna come over?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.963
Dude, look,
I'll come up this weekend,
we'll burn it solid.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.501
I'll see you this weekend.
Late.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.684
Shit, man.
Don't you knock?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.986
All right. Whoops.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.287
Shut the door, perv.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.157
I found you in the game.
You got it good.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.693
We haven't played
for hours.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.728
OK.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.240
This is not real.
Don't freak.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.869
Hello?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.871
Hello?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.641
Rex?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.878
Sar...

06:50.911 --> 06:52.980
Sarah?

06:54.748 --> 06:57.250
Rex! No!

06:57.284 --> 06:59.386
Please!

06:59.419 --> 07:03.190
Oh!

07:50.370 --> 07:53.006
That was fast.
Hi. How are you?

07:53.040 --> 07:56.143
Did you take care
of the marina report?
I was just about to.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.179
Oh, don't bother.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.516
He wants to see you right away,
and he's in one of his moods.

08:02.550 --> 08:06.319
Happy birthday,
by the way.
Oh, merc darling.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.055
Hi.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.863
I was just gonna...
Over a month.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.365
That's how long
I've been working on this.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.367
Right? That's, uh...

08:20.400 --> 08:22.736
That's 100...
that's 100 hours.

08:22.770 --> 08:26.039
I'm sorry. I'll finish
the marina report
as soon as possible.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.041
The ma... The what?

08:28.075 --> 08:31.144
Marina report?
Yeah.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.047
Oh, man.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.250
Hm.
Hutch.
What?

08:37.284 --> 08:40.754
You know what?
Have a seat.
Enjoy yourself. OK?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.690
All right,
listen to me now, OK?

08:42.723 --> 08:46.560
I hired you for one reason,
and one reason only.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.730
Now, the walk-through
says I dump the ammo
and the boss dies.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.200
I'm sorry. We're not
still talking about
Silent Hill 4, are we?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.936
Yes.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.106
OK. Damn.
All right.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.442
Uh... I don't know
what else to tell you.
You got the hyperblaster?

09:02.475 --> 09:05.913
Do I look like an asshole?
Yes, I have the hyperblaster.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.115
Right, OK.
Yeah, dump it.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.283
I mean, it's got unlimited
ammo, nullifies the secret...

09:10.317 --> 09:12.352
Hey, can I get tomorrow off?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.688
Let me think about that.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.190
No, no, no. I need it
to get to the final boss.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.392
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.

09:19.426 --> 09:23.363
You know, Hutch, if you put
as much effort into clerking
as you did into gaming,

09:23.396 --> 09:27.134
you could end up
like me someday.
You know that, right?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.536
OK.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.372
All right,
you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.708
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.543
So lose it right before
going down the stairs.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.046
She'll die on her own.
Game over.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.814
All right.
OK. Hey, man,

09:40.848 --> 09:42.783
are you hip to this
PDA sex thing?

09:42.816 --> 09:43.917
I haven't got into that.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.385
You've got a
phone call, Hutch.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.722
Thank you.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.791
I think that's
a vegetable.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.093
Hello?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.666
What?

10:18.686 --> 10:23.356
Oh, Hutch.
I'm so glad that you came.
It means so much to me.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.966
Today we lay
to rest Loomis Crowley...

10:50.583 --> 10:52.853
Did you just take
a picture of me?
I did.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.989
There are so many crying
faces at this funeral

10:56.023 --> 10:59.359
and you seem the saddest,
but you weren't crying,

10:59.392 --> 11:02.562
so I took a picture.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.367
You and Loomis
must have been close.
Yeah, we were close.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.738
I mean, we were so close, but...
Did you know Loomis?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.672
Kinda.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.909
I grew up with Sarah
back in Georgia.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.178
I was supposed to hang out
with her that night.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.414
Really?
Yeah, so was I.

11:21.448 --> 11:26.586
I always thought I'd be
taking pictures on her
wedding day, not her funeral.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.858
Looks like you're up.
Emma. Hi.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.360
Hi.
How are you?
God, look at you.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.428
You're so grown up.
How are you doing?

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
I'm OK. Um, here.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.769
This is your brother's bag.
You don't want this?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.571
Mom and Dad won't let me
play those video games.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.374
They were gonna toss 'em.
You know, they're too violent.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.509
Besides, he would
want you to have 'em.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.179
Come here.
Take care,
all right?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
OK.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.719
Here. If you need to talk,
that's my number.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.884
Hey, sunshine.
Hey.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.854
Didn't think you'd
be back so soon.
Give us a kiss.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.792
Sorry, Hutch.
Are you OK?

12:38.826 --> 12:41.829
Yeah, I don't know.
It's hard to believe.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.933
Tragedy, Hutch. I tell you, bro,
first your parents, now this.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.335
God dealt the straws
and gave you a short one, man.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.637
You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth

12:50.670 --> 12:53.773
is that stupid insensitive
shit comes out of it.
You're an idiot.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.943
Be strong -
that's all I'm saying.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.811
You know what I mean, bro?
You're a rock. I love you.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.947
I love you too.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.748
Who talks to their
brother like that?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.150
Somebody with an
idiot for a brother.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.986
Oh, my God,
you're a terrible person.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.088
So, do they know
what happened yet?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.523
He was murdered -
him and two of his friends.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.860
That's awful.
What's in the bag?

13:12.893 --> 13:15.495
Video games, pictures,
crap like that.
From Loomis?

13:15.528 --> 13:16.563
Yeah.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.636
No shit!
Is this you two?
Yeah.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.238
Look at that.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.042
Lighter works.

13:31.411 --> 13:35.315
Gorgeous.
Dude, you can keep
that if you like it.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.285
I'm sorry, Hutch.
You must have been adopted.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.121
Thank you, Loomis.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.856
So he was a real gamer, huh?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.124
Yeah.
Any good titles in the bag?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.759
I'm not sure.
Check it out.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.563
Goddamn, y'all.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.900
Stay Alive?
Never heard of it.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.369
Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out
the night he died.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.172
He asked me to come over and
play. I totally blew him off.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.342
Hutch, come on.
You didn't know.
I know. It's just...

14:02.375 --> 14:05.078
How'd he get his hands on it?
He did some beta-testing.

14:05.112 --> 14:09.349
I beta-tested for a while.
It's awesome at first,
then it's goddamn monotonous.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.018
Let's burn a
round for Loomis.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.187
Are you an idiot?
I told you,
that'd be weird.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.989
That was the last thing
he was doing before he died.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.358
Hey, sack up, bro.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.160
If Loomis was indeed
testing this game,

14:20.193 --> 14:24.031
that means
it is barely legal.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.199
Yeah, this could be nice.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
Hey.
Jesus Christ!

14:59.066 --> 15:02.302
Can Hutch come
out and play?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.737
Swink, you scared
the crap out of me, man.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.807
Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.712
I wanna make sure
we're all set up.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.314
So, uh...

15:14.347 --> 15:17.250
I'm sorry, you know,
about your friend and all.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.719
It...

15:19.752 --> 15:21.554
stinks.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.224
Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good.
No worries.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.327
It'll be good to
hang out with you guys,
get my mind off things.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.629
Hey. Ooh.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.300
Dollface, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

15:33.333 --> 15:36.769
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas,
this is Abigail.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.672
She's kind of a friend
of Loomis's. She's gonna
hang out for a while.

15:39.706 --> 15:43.510
What's up, mama?
What's up?
I gotta pee.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.179
Oh, yeah.
It's right down the hallway.
Oh, sorry.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.847
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.716
Girl has got
body karate going on.

15:53.453 --> 15:57.290
Anyone who says size
doesn't matter never played
a third-person shooter.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.891
You're a whore.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.862
Here.
No.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.298
What did you say?
Hey.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.870
God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.175
Don't worry,
I'll get your back.
Thank you.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.609
Sweet Sebastian Bach,
I wanna play.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.046
Bossman hooking up?

16:19.079 --> 16:22.482
Miller, you signed in?
You there?
Yeah, I'm here.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.353
Yeah, Loretta called my wife,
told her I got caught up
in a partner meeting.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.488
All right, guys.
Enough chatter.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.390
The name of this
game is Stay Alive.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.426
We don't know much else,
other than we're not
supposed to have it.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.032
Sit back down.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.200
Bro!

16:40.233 --> 16:42.502
Let's do it.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.404
Dude.
Put your hands on it.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.572
Disgusting.
Touch it.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.097
She's stubborn.
Isn't letting me
get to the game.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.266
Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.170
Just a thought.
Voice No way.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.306
That's next-generation
technology.
OK.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.411
"Come to me, clouds."

17:24.444 --> 17:26.579
Whoa.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.082
What?

17:29.116 --> 17:30.850
It's... it's like
a séance or...

17:30.883 --> 17:32.885
Can we skip this bullshit
cinematic foreplay?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.587
I wanna butter this muffin.

17:34.621 --> 17:38.958
OK. Let's go.
Everybody say this, right?
OK.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.530
"Come to me, clouds.

17:43.563 --> 17:48.034
"May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.572
"Let the cover of night
bear witness and destroy
those who resist

17:52.605 --> 17:55.275
"so they shall harm me not.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.710
"Let the blood
of many cleanse me,

17:57.744 --> 18:00.847
preserving beauty eternal,
I pray you."

18:09.256 --> 18:12.625
Welcome.
If you're listening to this,

18:12.659 --> 18:14.561
it means you've
made a grave mistake.

18:14.594 --> 18:19.466
You spoke the words,
and soon you will die for it.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.569
At this very moment,
the evil of this place

18:22.602 --> 18:25.238
courses through your veins.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.107
You have been marked for death.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.510
Your choice
has brought you here,

18:30.543 --> 18:32.845
to Gerouge Plantation.

18:32.879 --> 18:37.517
200 years ago,
Countess Elizabeth Bathory

18:37.550 --> 18:39.452
opened Gerouge as a finishing
school for young...

18:39.486 --> 18:41.354
Gerouge.
You've heard of it?

18:41.388 --> 18:44.491
Yeah. Grandma used to tell us if
we didn't get home before dark,

18:44.524 --> 18:47.660
we'd get taken off
by something...

18:47.694 --> 18:49.829
Yeah, but do you remember
Grandma used to wear panties
on the outside?

18:49.862 --> 18:53.132
Seriously, though,
I know this, guys.
I've heard this story.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.636
What happened to those
girls was so depraved

18:56.669 --> 18:59.172
that all accounts were
stricken from public record.

18:59.206 --> 19:04.344
The evil of Gerouge
has been reborn.

19:04.377 --> 19:08.215
Your salvation lies
beyond the gates
of this plantation.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.283
Your only chance is this:

19:10.317 --> 19:13.886
uncover the horrible truth
about Gerouge Plantation

19:13.920 --> 19:15.788
and stop the evil.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.890
But, in order to do that,

19:17.924 --> 19:20.893
you must stay alive.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.899
My God.
I'm starting to get
a little creeped out.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.768
Sh!
Shut the hell up.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.705
Where the hell
are you going, bro?

19:32.739 --> 19:34.707
Just trying to figure it out.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.544
What is that?

19:37.577 --> 19:38.545
Whoa.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.982
You guys feel that?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.518
Hell, yeah.
Feel it in my pants, baby.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.019
Must mean we're
close to something.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.121
Or something's
close to us.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.364
Uh, you better
pull your weapon, bro.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.266
Somebody do something.
Swink?

19:59.299 --> 20:01.100
No, I'm good.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.438
How do you kill her?
She's already dead. Look out!

20:12.279 --> 20:14.180
When fear cripples you,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.416
when death's shadow
surrounds you,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.351
drop a rose.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.952
It will help you stay alive.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.022
Right. It'll give us a chance
to escape ghosts we can't face.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.792
Undead can't cross
the twig of a wild rose.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.027
That is what you learn when you
read too much goth chick-lit.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.696
You should lay
off the incense, sister.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.631
And the game's fun,

20:31.664 --> 20:33.800
but it kind of moves
along at a snail's pace.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.936
Left, go left.
Left! On your left!

20:36.969 --> 20:39.539
Left! Left!
Goddamn it, you noob!

20:39.572 --> 20:42.809
OK, and you eat my nails,
and you eat my nails.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.779
Go round the mausoleum, man.
Nice. And eat this.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.715
Come on!

20:48.748 --> 20:50.650
Sweet Jesus, these dead bitches
are coming out in droves.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.985
Miller, the Bathory tomb,
in front of you.

20:53.019 --> 20:57.123
Do not close the door, man.
Do not close the door.
No! Oh, my God!

21:01.160 --> 21:03.162
Hello, Mumsy.

21:03.195 --> 21:06.299
Whoa, whoa.
What's that?
What's... where?

21:06.333 --> 21:09.402
There. Is something
in that wardrobe?
Oh, nice eye.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.070
Thank you.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.972
Congrats, Abs.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.007
It's a secret
room or something.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.856
Is that a diary?
Yeah.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.492
The one from the beginning
with the prayer in it.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.293
Miller, are you OK?

21:34.327 --> 21:36.796
Yeah. No, I'm good.

21:36.829 --> 21:41.000
Are you in those tunnels again?
There is no action there.
The doors are locked.

21:41.033 --> 21:45.938
Well, they're open now.
You know, I'm exploring,
tearing shit up.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.641
Ownin' fools.
"Ownin' fools"?

21:48.675 --> 21:50.677
I'm telling you,
my controller is vibrating.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.979
You'd better drop a rose.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.950
Now I'm out of...
I'm out of...

21:57.984 --> 22:00.653
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.021
Tell us what you see
before you book it.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.990
Some sort of sick
torture room or...

22:04.023 --> 22:06.192
God, man.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.929
I just saw a flash
of dead girls, or...

22:12.499 --> 22:14.066
Goddammit, man.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.973
She got me.
One of the girls?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.142
Some woman, man.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.078
I think it was the dame
from the painting.
You know, that countess.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.148
I didn't even get a chance
to fight her, man.

22:29.181 --> 22:33.052
Where's the torture chamber?
I went through
a secret entrance.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.521
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.255
Well...

22:36.288 --> 22:39.258
Hey, is somebody out there?

22:42.729 --> 22:45.865
Miller,
who are you talking to?
I don't know.

22:45.898 --> 22:49.268
Probably some goddamn
rent-a-cop trying to scare
the shit out of the living.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.339
You know what they say.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.575
You play the game too long,
you start seeing shit.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.510
You know,
or have seizures.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.011
Games could
cause seizures.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.680
Perceptive reality,
on the other hand,

23:00.713 --> 23:03.349
has yielded some
interesting studies.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.517
And you've
read them all.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.019
I have. It seems
the longer you play,

23:07.053 --> 23:10.089
the more your mind
perceives the game world
to be a reality.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.358
It's interesting,
but it's only a theory.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.561
But then there's
retinal memory, which...

23:14.594 --> 23:16.362
That is so fascinating,
sweetie,

23:16.395 --> 23:18.765
but I'm feeling like
we should call it a night.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.400
Yeah, some of us
have gotta be at work.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.136
All right. Miller,
you can rejoin us, then.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.873
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.575
Thanks again for hanging,
you guys.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.777
I really needed it.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.245
To Loomis.
To Loomis.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.282
To Loomis.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.460
All right. OK. OK.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.618
Perceptive reality.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.036
Hutch!
Loretta.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.605
What's going on?
What's going on?

26:12.639 --> 26:14.607
What's going on?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.776
It's Miller.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.479
Miller?

26:20.512 --> 26:22.314
Miller. Miller!

26:22.348 --> 26:24.817
Hey, it's a crime scene.
You have to clear out.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.486
Can I get a damn
curtain over here?

26:27.519 --> 26:30.122
I just spoke to him
a few hours ago.
Whoa. A few hours ago?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.323
Get off me.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.326
All right, buddy.
Come on. Come on.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.529
Thanks.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.802
I know this kind
of thing ain't easy, son.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.905
I'm gonna try
to be quick about it.

26:45.938 --> 26:49.776
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?

26:49.809 --> 26:52.812
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.847
Oh.

26:54.881 --> 26:58.284
His wife said that
he was working late.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.319
Yeah, sorry.
What I meant was,

27:00.352 --> 27:04.290
he was playing from here
and I was at my place.
Uh-huh.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.958
Just the two of you?

27:05.992 --> 27:08.494
I was with four friends.
We were online.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.663
Uh-huh.

27:10.697 --> 27:13.165
Make sure we get those names.
Roger that.

27:13.199 --> 27:17.036
Do you live close
Yeah, uptown.
Off Magazine.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.639
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.676
Those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime

27:23.710 --> 27:25.177
Charlie, chill.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.179
I just wanna know
what happened to him.
All right?

27:27.213 --> 27:28.881
All right, now.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.854
OK, if you ever need
to give me a call,

27:34.887 --> 27:37.857
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.

27:37.890 --> 27:41.027
I may need to speak
with you again.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.197
And I'm sorry
about your friend.

27:45.231 --> 27:48.467
Thanks.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.936
All right.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.320
Sweet shit!
Get a load of this!

28:08.354 --> 28:10.890
I think I've
found bossman's body.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.361
Oh, God!
That's off-putting.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.064
Didn't you just say
Miller was stabbed?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.398
Man, I can't look at this.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.700
I'll have to quit
hanging around with you.

28:21.734 --> 28:25.237
I'm sorry. Phin,
if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.506
Now shut the goddamn game up.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.778
Because we found
Miller's body in it?
It is a horror survival game.

28:31.811 --> 28:35.281
I hate to be a dick,
but I think you guys are
overreacting a little bit.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.683
Would you show
some respect, man?
Respect?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.351
You pay respect
to gamers by gaming,

28:39.385 --> 28:41.620
so let's boot it up.
To Miller.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.390
You're not playing
for Miller or Loomis.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.859
You didn't even
know those guys, right?

28:46.893 --> 28:49.028
If you wanna curl up
in the fetal position
for the day, fine,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.462
but don't expect me to.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.199
As for you, I just met you
yesterday, so kiss my ass.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.400
Phin!
What?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.102
Look, why don't you
guys get out of here

28:56.135 --> 28:57.636
and let me play in peace?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.241
Peace.

29:09.681 --> 29:13.285
Hey, take it easy.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.287
I'm sorry.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.496
Are you OK?

29:24.530 --> 29:27.399
I'm just having
a hard time, you know?
Yeah.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.336
Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,

29:30.369 --> 29:32.638
other than you
can't game for shit.

29:32.671 --> 29:36.342
Well, I grew up in Georgia.

29:36.375 --> 29:40.847
My dad's an architect
and my mom's a kindergarten
schoolteacher.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.314
I'm going to Princeton
in the fall.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.484
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.486
I don't know about perfect.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.623
Uh...
Sorry. I'm sorry.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.760
Are you all right?
Yeah.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.795
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.201
What's up?

30:05.371 --> 30:08.174
Finding Miller's
body in the game...

30:08.207 --> 30:10.676
Look, I'm no gamer,

30:10.709 --> 30:14.346
but there are only
so many ways you could
die in a video game.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.984
It's all just
really bad timing.

30:18.017 --> 30:22.188
Not really. In a sense,
the timing is bad because
he overresponds to deaths.

30:22.221 --> 30:27.626
But the coincidence
of finding Miller's game body
and his real body was perfect.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.328
That's why we're freaked out.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.597
It's better
in single player anyway.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.935
Dickheads.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.674
All right, Countess, let's go.

30:42.708 --> 30:46.979
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.

30:47.013 --> 30:47.914
You can't break this one.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.386
Maybe timing had
nothing to do with it.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.988
Maybe it was inevitable.

30:56.022 --> 30:59.025
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.193
Where are you going?

31:01.227 --> 31:06.532
Loomis and his friends were
playing that video game the
night they died. Now Miller.

31:06.565 --> 31:10.836
What are the chances of all
of them being murdered right
after playing that game?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.538
Jesus, if Phineus is playing...

31:12.571 --> 31:15.774
Come on, honey.
You've gotta relax.
It's just bad timing.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.377
Swink said maybe timing
has nothing to do with it.

31:18.410 --> 31:22.048
Did I say that? I have
a penchant for big theories.
Don't listen to me.

31:28.154 --> 31:32.724
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!

31:32.758 --> 31:36.728
What are you doing, man?
I'm pulling this bitch.
What's it look like?

31:39.231 --> 31:42.401
What if Loomis and Miller...
Was more than a coincidence?

31:42.434 --> 31:46.538
They both played the game
and then they died, so...

31:46.572 --> 31:48.807
obviously the video game
killed them, right?

31:48.840 --> 31:51.577
Are you serious, man?
Listen to yourself.
Phin.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.580
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Check this mirror I found.

31:54.613 --> 31:58.550
I flipped it. The back works
like a mirror, but it won't
break like the others.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.086
I think it's made
out of polished silver.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.654
I don't know.
You guys don't have one.

32:05.291 --> 32:09.895
You've been through a lot
and you know I love you,

32:09.928 --> 32:11.497
but you're freaking
everybody out now.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.700
I know. Yeah.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.812
Nice.

34:02.408 --> 34:06.011
"No distinguishing marks."

34:06.044 --> 34:09.281
Had a broken banister.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.168
"Adjoined twin blades."

35:05.704 --> 35:07.806
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap

35:07.839 --> 35:10.342
Hot sugar.
We had this conversation.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.010
Call me crazy,
call me paranoid,

35:12.043 --> 35:14.413
I don't give a shit.
Just look at this.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.682
Why isn't Phineus showing?

35:16.715 --> 35:18.450
He said he'd be here,
so he'll be here.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.487
OK. So we all saw that Miller
was stabbed to death.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.954
The cops think he was
stabbed with shears.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.156
Loomis's friends too.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.659
Sarah - her body
was drained of blood.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.595
The police report said
Loomis's neck was broken,

35:29.628 --> 35:31.630
and he was hung in the game.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.500
They all died the same way
they died in the game.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.668
This can't just
be some coincidence.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.540
I don't like this at all.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.145
I think you're right.

35:47.179 --> 35:52.117
You know I told you
I heard the story
of Gerouge from my grandma?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.686
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted

35:54.720 --> 35:56.188
and very real.

35:56.222 --> 36:00.559
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.

36:00.592 --> 36:05.130
The tower, the cemetery,
the torture chamber.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.666
She'd hunt for victims
in a black carriage.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.068
She'd gut them
with silver shears.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.471
The shattered mirrors,
why were they broken?

36:12.504 --> 36:15.173
She couldn't stand to see
herself get old. All facts.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.976
All I care about is
finding out what happened
to Miller and Loomis,

36:18.009 --> 36:19.911
and you are not helping.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.914
As punishment, they walled
the bitch up in her tower alive

36:22.948 --> 36:24.350
and here's the kicker.

36:24.383 --> 36:29.355
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.

36:29.388 --> 36:33.725
So what if she's back
and killing us one by one
after we die in the game?

36:33.759 --> 36:36.428
This is insane.
Listen to yourself.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.364
You don't want
to listen to me, fine.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.732
All I care about is:
Where the hell is Phineus?

36:40.766 --> 36:42.368
* Close your eyes

36:42.401 --> 36:44.270
* I want to ride the skies

36:44.303 --> 36:48.039
* In my sweet dreams

36:48.073 --> 36:50.041
* Close your eyes

36:50.075 --> 36:51.843
* I want to see you tonight

36:51.877 --> 36:56.348
* In my sweet dreams

36:56.382 --> 36:58.717
Funky.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.623
Is anybody out there?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.925
Phin, are you OK?

37:39.958 --> 37:42.394
Yeah, I'm awesome.
Phin, it's Hutch.
Where are you?

37:42.428 --> 37:45.964
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck
out on River Road.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.234
I'm just south of
Binky's Adult Store.
I'll drive.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.770
Who's that
Yeah.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.739
What's up, mama?
What's up?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.808
Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality,

37:56.842 --> 37:59.811
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things,
or both?

37:59.845 --> 38:01.947
Both. It's bizarre.
Retinally speaking...

38:01.980 --> 38:07.619
Shut up. I've not tripped
out like this since I ate
that matzo ball at Bible camp.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.356
Hey, Phin, hang on.
We're coming to get you.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.190
Let's go.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.827
You didn't die in the game.
I'll be right there.

38:15.861 --> 38:19.030
That's right!
I didn't die in the game, baby.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.151
Hey.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.866
Wait a minute.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.168
In the game,
she only comes at night.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.851
Is anybody out there?

39:26.532 --> 39:29.034
OK, we're close.
Look for his car.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.540
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop! Wait.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.642
Phin!

39:45.283 --> 39:47.919
Phin.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.605
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way
he died in the game.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.441
Need to tell me something?

40:13.311 --> 40:15.547
This is...

40:15.581 --> 40:18.984
This is gonna
sound crazy,

40:19.017 --> 40:22.488
but this game,
Stay Alive,

40:22.521 --> 40:24.956
is about
the Gerouge Plantation

40:24.990 --> 40:27.158
and a woman,
Elizabeth Bathory.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.560
I think I know that
ghost story, yeah.

40:28.594 --> 40:32.798
OK. Phineus was run over
by a carriage in the game.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.634
Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.

40:35.667 --> 40:36.802
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, kid.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.238
I got this game
last week from a friend.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.109
Him and two of his friends
were murdered the same way
they died in the game.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.178
Now, explain that.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.081
Right.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.752
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.186
You lived with
that family, right?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.956
After what happened
with your folks?
Yeah.

40:57.989 --> 41:01.026
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.461
You know I did,
Detective.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.132
Technically,
anybody can hack into...

41:07.165 --> 41:10.536
Shut up.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.203
Let's take a walk.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.709
Let's see why
you're so scared.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.612
I don't think...
Shut up.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.148
How do you do this thing?
You have to read that.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.685
All right.
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."

41:26.718 --> 41:29.888
There must
be a connection.

41:29.921 --> 41:33.291
Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
Look, I already told you...

41:33.324 --> 41:36.728
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend,
game or no game,

41:36.762 --> 41:39.731
next time I see you
on a crime scene,
I'm gonna take you in.

41:39.765 --> 41:42.467
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.869
Someone you cared
about, Detective.

41:43.902 --> 41:47.205
I would let the cops
do their job.
Hey!

41:49.340 --> 41:50.809
Hey, don't play that game.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.144
Hey! Come on! Come on.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.547
I just think it would
be better if no one plays.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.315
I can see,
at your tender age,

41:57.348 --> 41:58.850
something like this
might scare you.

41:58.884 --> 42:02.187
Come on.
Come on.
I got it.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.522
All right.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.157
I'm gonna look
into this,

42:06.191 --> 42:08.694
but you're gonna
have to go home, Hutch.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.497
Why don't you
lock that kid up?

42:12.530 --> 42:15.667
He rode up on a carriage and
mowed down the girl's brother?

42:15.701 --> 42:17.936
This game business
sounds like bullshit.

42:17.969 --> 42:21.773
That's great.
That's just really stupendous.

42:21.807 --> 42:23.541
I know it!
We all know it!

42:23.575 --> 42:25.076
Something's happening,
something bad!

42:25.110 --> 42:28.747
Swink,
shut the hell up!

42:28.780 --> 42:31.617
You're not helping, man.

42:36.254 --> 42:39.925
Why did you have to bring
that game into our lives,
Hutch?

42:46.564 --> 42:48.366
Why?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.901
October.

42:49.935 --> 42:54.572
My brother was
all that I had.

42:56.107 --> 42:59.577
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.026
October...

43:19.330 --> 43:22.768
I didn't know.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.836
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.112
I don't want anybody
else to get hurt.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.287
Neither do I.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.389
So we have
to do something.

43:47.826 --> 43:51.129
Hutch, I want you
to find out everything
you can about this game.

43:51.162 --> 43:54.632
OK. I can start
with Loomis's house.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.468
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of some things
for Phin.

43:57.502 --> 43:59.771
Are you OK? Are you sure
you're up to this?

43:59.805 --> 44:04.209
Hutch,
somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.

44:04.242 --> 44:08.646
I'm gonna find whoever
did it and hurt them.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.215
OK.

44:10.248 --> 44:13.484
Abigail, stay with Hutch.
But if anything
happens to him...

44:13.518 --> 44:16.254
And we don't play that game,
not for a second.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.795
Hey, a little help here.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.364
Let me guess. Your wife
and kids are driving you nuts.

44:26.397 --> 44:30.535
Need something to take
the edge off? Something
with a high frag-count.

44:30.568 --> 44:34.305
Do I look 12, man?
I take it you
don't play, then.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.709
I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana
Q bert tournament.

44:37.743 --> 44:40.245
Oh, Q ber huh?
Great.
Yeah, listen.

44:40.278 --> 44:43.414
I need information
on a horror game
called Stay Alive.

44:43.448 --> 44:46.317
Stay Alive?
Never heard of it.

44:46.351 --> 44:49.654
Maybe it's underground.
Do you know who made it?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.757
Probably some basehead
in his mom's attic.

44:51.790 --> 44:55.727
You know,
a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.

44:55.761 --> 44:58.730
You wouldn't play a game
by Charlie Manson.

44:58.764 --> 45:00.198
No. Probably not.

45:00.231 --> 45:03.001
Maybe you already have.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.272
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.

45:07.305 --> 45:12.410
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.

45:12.443 --> 45:15.413
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,

45:15.446 --> 45:17.582
I'll talk to you
in a little bit,
all right?

45:29.928 --> 45:32.964
She must have left
at least one of these
windows open.

45:32.998 --> 45:37.235
How do you know that?
I lived with the Crowleys
for a while.

45:37.268 --> 45:40.305
Oh, yeah.

45:40.338 --> 45:45.343
Yeah, it was like,
you know, Loomis's house
just felt like home.

45:46.945 --> 45:52.283
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...

45:52.317 --> 45:55.320
You don't have
to talk about it.
No.

45:55.353 --> 45:59.290
My dad went a little nuts,

45:59.324 --> 46:02.293
thought my mom was sleeping
around, which she wasn't.

46:02.327 --> 46:07.765
He figured if she wasn't
gonna be with him,

46:07.799 --> 46:09.134
she wouldn't be with anybody,

46:09.167 --> 46:12.838
so he set the place on fire.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.273
Just torched it.

46:15.306 --> 46:19.277
The firemen barely got me
out alive, but my mom...

46:21.046 --> 46:24.582
She was still in bed
when they found her.

46:24.615 --> 46:29.620
I tell myself
if I'd been a little older

46:29.654 --> 46:32.858
or a little braver,
I would've...

46:32.891 --> 46:35.693
I would've stopped him.

46:35.726 --> 46:39.297
I didn't move.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.799
When he gets out,
he'll be 76.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.601
Ain't nothing
like family.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.804
This window's open.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.675
So that's why
you're scared of fire?

46:50.708 --> 46:53.778
That's why I hate fire.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.181
I'll go around
to the front door, OK?
OK.

47:26.211 --> 47:27.845
Come on. Come on, come on.

47:27.879 --> 47:30.681
Let's just check out
Loomis's room.

47:34.519 --> 47:38.323
What could we
find in here that the cops
haven't already found?

47:38.356 --> 47:40.858
They didn't know
where to look.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.599
Huh.

47:48.633 --> 47:52.770
What?
What is it?

47:52.803 --> 47:55.941
It's the game company
Loomis tested for,
where he got the game.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.409
Scary.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.946
I found the address
for the game company.

48:00.979 --> 48:04.515
Tell me where
1420 Cypress Road is.

48:04.549 --> 48:08.186
Not a problem.
Let's see.

48:08.219 --> 48:12.057
Take the Belle Chasse
Highway to Breaux Bridge,
near Spanish Lake.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.692
Look, we're heading
to the game developer.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.628
I've been reading this book
called The Malleus Demonium.

48:17.662 --> 48:20.865
What?
It means
"The Witch's Hammer."

48:20.898 --> 48:24.035
It was a handbook for witch
hunters in the Inquisition.
It says if we find her,

48:24.069 --> 48:28.606
we need to put three nails
through her heart,
neck, and then forehead.

48:28.639 --> 48:31.609
The nails are gonna
put her human spirit
back into her body,

48:31.642 --> 48:34.712
and then this is really,
really important, you guys -

48:34.745 --> 48:38.249
an undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood.

48:38.283 --> 48:41.652
So you think her ghost
could've been brought back?

48:41.686 --> 48:45.856
It's like a séance. A strong
enough spirit can be brought
back with the proper text.

48:47.993 --> 48:49.794
I just can't believe this.

48:49.827 --> 48:53.098
Detective Charles King
was murdered today
at Clearwater Mall.

48:53.131 --> 48:54.465
O

48:54.499 --> 48:56.801
Sources say
this murder may be linked...

48:56.834 --> 49:00.571
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.907
What?

49:02.940 --> 49:04.809
We've got another problem.

49:06.978 --> 49:09.614
Oh, God.
The police are here.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.284
OK, OK.
Meet us at Loomis's.

49:13.318 --> 49:16.287
Loomis's?
He's right.

49:16.321 --> 49:18.289
If you don't wanna
go to jail, go now.
Jail?

49:18.323 --> 49:20.325
Now! Come on!

49:25.330 --> 49:26.864
Give it to me.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.243
Toss the apartment.

49:42.513 --> 49:45.250
What have we got?

49:51.089 --> 49:53.291
You remember her diary?
Her diary?

49:53.324 --> 49:57.028
Yeah, in the game.

49:57.062 --> 49:58.996
What if that's it?
What?

49:59.030 --> 50:00.798
The proper text.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.668
That would mean that...

50:03.701 --> 50:05.703
This is not about some ghost.

50:05.736 --> 50:09.507
You expect me to believe we
conjured up her evil spirit
with a game séance?

50:09.540 --> 50:11.376
To start, we all
had to recite that prayer.

50:11.409 --> 50:14.011
That just...
It's highly unlikely.

50:16.281 --> 50:19.817
What is it,
Swink?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.686
October and I were
talking about this.

50:21.719 --> 50:23.488
I don't know.
Maybe she's onto something.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.156
Why is the game on?
What?

50:25.190 --> 50:28.726
The game.

50:28.759 --> 50:30.328
I didn't turn it on.

50:30.361 --> 50:33.064
I told you not to play.

50:35.100 --> 50:38.203
Where's October?
She's out smoking.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.796
But you said if we didn't
play the game we'd be fine.

51:05.830 --> 51:08.032
I thought those
were the rules.

51:08.065 --> 51:12.203
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe there aren't any. October!

51:12.237 --> 51:15.140
It's not possible.
I didn't play.
None of us did.

51:15.173 --> 51:17.708
If nobody played the game,
that means...

51:17.742 --> 51:19.644
The game's
playing by itself.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.368
OK.

52:42.327 --> 52:43.828
October!

52:43.861 --> 52:46.231
October!

52:58.209 --> 52:59.344
Shit!

53:06.384 --> 53:08.819
No!

53:11.088 --> 53:13.190
Let me go!

53:17.428 --> 53:20.665
October!
October!

53:20.698 --> 53:22.833
October!

53:25.636 --> 53:28.773
Help me!

53:28.806 --> 53:31.141
October!

53:33.778 --> 53:36.213
Let me go!

53:36.247 --> 53:37.882
Open the window!
Come on!

53:41.719 --> 53:43.488
Come on!

53:47.958 --> 53:51.696
Go fuck yourself.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.365
Come on.

53:54.399 --> 53:58.135
It's open. It's open.
October!

53:58.168 --> 54:02.307
Oh, no! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

54:02.340 --> 54:04.542
You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.

54:04.575 --> 54:07.812
I can fix this.
I can fix this.
No, no, no,

54:07.845 --> 54:11.682
Goddammit! Please,
don't do this to me!

54:25.162 --> 54:26.764
I shouldn't have
left her alone.

54:26.797 --> 54:29.166
This isn't
your fault, Swink.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.670
This is all my fault.

54:36.006 --> 54:39.477
You should've left
when you had the chance.

54:39.510 --> 54:42.647
Your life was
perfect before this.

54:45.182 --> 54:47.117
My dad's not an architect.

54:47.151 --> 54:49.787
What?
My dad's not an architect.

54:49.820 --> 54:54.291
My mom doesn't
teach first grade.
You mean kindergarten?

54:54.325 --> 54:58.596
Whatever. I'm not
heading to Princeton.

54:58.629 --> 55:02.600
Pretty much everything
I said was bullshit.

55:02.633 --> 55:03.834
So this van is...

55:03.868 --> 55:06.971
Home sweet home.

55:07.004 --> 55:12.242
I hate telling people the truth
and watching them get
embarrassed for asking.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.652
We gotta end this.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.622
We gotta stop it.

55:24.655 --> 55:26.123
I don't think
we have much time.

55:26.156 --> 55:29.527
You're right.
We don't have a lot of time.

55:30.895 --> 55:32.797
We need to find her body.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.500
Which means we need
to find her tower.

55:35.533 --> 55:39.003
Whoever made this game
knows everything about
Elizabeth Bathory.

55:39.036 --> 55:43.841
They're the ones who are
gonna know exactly where
her plantation really is.

55:49.514 --> 55:51.982
Hey! Swink,
what are you doing?

55:52.016 --> 55:54.819
It's obvious we have to
stay alive in the game
until we end this.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.186
One of us has to play.

55:56.220 --> 55:57.988
If you die in the game...

55:58.022 --> 56:00.991
Something won't let us
stop playing. Am I right?

56:01.025 --> 56:04.662
If it's gonna play with
or without us, at least
I can use myself as a decoy.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.863
I can protect us.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.698
Let's go.

56:24.148 --> 56:28.786
All right, buddy,
you know what to do.
Stay alive.

56:43.434 --> 56:46.003
Game time.

56:48.005 --> 56:50.775
This thing is gay.

57:01.151 --> 57:05.322
This is where
they made Stay Alive?

57:05.355 --> 57:07.658
It seems like
a strange place
to make a game.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.999
Come on.
Let's go.

57:38.489 --> 57:40.525
Hello?

57:56.406 --> 57:58.809
Hold on. I'm gonna
check it out, OK?

57:58.843 --> 58:00.511
Wait here.

58:23.233 --> 58:25.035
Oh, my God.

58:36.781 --> 58:39.016
Holy shit.

58:48.225 --> 58:50.861
Thank God, man.
Tell me you haven't
died in the game.

58:50.895 --> 58:53.497
No, we're fine.
The place is deserted.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.932
OK, I need you
to get to the back door.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.667
I'm not really
sure where that is.

58:56.701 --> 58:59.436
What room are you in?
Some kind of parlor.

58:59.469 --> 59:01.338
All right. Hold on.

59:15.986 --> 59:18.956
You're looking
at two entries?
Yeah.

59:18.989 --> 59:21.792
Move through the archway,
not the doorway,
back into the hall.

59:40.444 --> 59:43.147
There should be
a staircase to the right
and the kitchen to the left.

59:43.180 --> 59:47.551
What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?

59:47.584 --> 59:51.121
Just pay attention.
All right, go through the
kitchen and out the back door.

59:51.155 --> 59:55.592
Just keep walking until you see
the steps with the statues.

1:00:01.999 --> 1:00:04.101
Do you see
the iron gates?

1:00:04.134 --> 1:00:06.136
Uh, yeah,
I see them.

1:00:11.776 --> 1:00:14.444
Just like the game.

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:27.191
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:00:42.873 --> 1:00:44.909
This is Gerouge Plantation.

1:00:47.177 --> 1:00:50.080
We're in the bitch's backyard.

1:02:03.653 --> 1:02:04.822
Elizabeth.

1:02:14.098 --> 1:02:15.966
What does this mean, Hutch?

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.135
It means her body's
up in that tower.

1:02:18.168 --> 1:02:19.669
No shit.

1:02:25.109 --> 1:02:26.977
Elizabeth's diary.

1:02:27.011 --> 1:02:29.646
All these girls.
She killed them all.

1:02:45.695 --> 1:02:48.298
Abigail's in trouble upstairs.
Which way do I go?

1:02:48.332 --> 1:02:49.900
Uh...

1:02:49.934 --> 1:02:52.502
It's faster to take
the staircase around the side.

1:02:52.536 --> 1:02:54.371
OK.

1:03:09.053 --> 1:03:12.456
It's locked! It's locked.
I need a crowbar or something.

1:03:14.959 --> 1:03:19.096
Do you
see one on the step?

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:21.365
You gotta be kidding me.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.210
Which way?
Right, to the bedroom.

1:03:33.243 --> 1:03:35.712
Aw, come on, Swink.

1:03:49.193 --> 1:03:50.394
I can't get in.
It's locked.

1:03:50.427 --> 1:03:53.864
Wait. Wait.
I have a key.

1:03:54.364 --> 1:03:55.532
This is...

1:03:55.565 --> 1:03:57.234
Insane. Now go!

1:04:01.371 --> 1:04:04.408
Hutch!

1:04:04.441 --> 1:04:08.312
I don't think I'm
gonna make it. Help me.
I know. I see her.

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:10.014
Let me try something.

1:04:19.789 --> 1:04:24.261
It's all right.
It's all right.

1:04:24.294 --> 1:04:26.730
It's OK.
It's all right. It's OK.

1:04:37.141 --> 1:04:39.676
What happened?
Are you guys all right?

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.878
Yeah. You saved
her life, man.

1:04:41.912 --> 1:04:44.514
Goddamn sweet!
So, what now?

1:04:44.548 --> 1:04:48.052
We need three nails.
And one last thing.
Remember what October said.

1:04:48.085 --> 1:04:51.455
The way to cleanse a witch's
soul is to burn her blood.

1:04:51.488 --> 1:04:53.623
Wait. The roses.

1:04:53.657 --> 1:04:55.459
If you're gonna go up there,
you can't forget the wild roses.

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:56.961
You never know,
and I bet...

1:05:00.330 --> 1:05:02.466
No! No!

1:05:21.018 --> 1:05:22.452
Hell, yeah!

1:05:22.486 --> 1:05:23.853
Swink!

1:05:31.861 --> 1:05:34.464
Come on, you bitch.

1:05:41.005 --> 1:05:43.907
Oh, shit.

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:47.477
Bitch, that's cheating!
I'm not dead yet.

1:05:47.511 --> 1:05:48.612
Go!

1:05:51.548 --> 1:05:53.117
Swink!
Swink!

1:05:53.150 --> 1:05:55.319
Swink!
Help me!

1:06:15.539 --> 1:06:18.008
Get away!
Get away from me!

1:06:41.898 --> 1:06:43.233
Swink!

1:06:50.374 --> 1:06:52.742
Hutch, I'm sorry.

1:07:07.524 --> 1:07:10.994
OK, we're gonna need a hammer.

1:07:26.210 --> 1:07:28.312
Come on.
Quick!

1:07:32.482 --> 1:07:34.418
Open the door!

1:07:40.924 --> 1:07:44.928
Hutch, come on.
Come on! Hutch!

1:07:57.607 --> 1:07:59.743
Thanks, Swink.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:05.449
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:08:05.482 --> 1:08:08.652
It's OK.
It's all right.

1:08:08.685 --> 1:08:09.986
OK?

1:08:18.662 --> 1:08:20.997
I'm gonna go first.
Stay right behind me.
OK.

1:08:41.485 --> 1:08:42.986
It's OK.

1:08:58.034 --> 1:08:59.569
Wait. Did you hear that?

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:05.074
OK. All right.
All right, all right.

1:09:11.681 --> 1:09:14.884
Come on.

1:09:14.918 --> 1:09:16.220
This way.
This way.

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:54.858
There should be
a second door in here.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:02.566
This should be the tower.
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

1:10:16.145 --> 1:10:17.781
Hutch!

1:10:17.814 --> 1:10:21.285
It won't open.
Oh, no! Open it!

1:10:21.318 --> 1:10:22.952
OK. OK, wait,
wait, wait.

1:10:22.986 --> 1:10:25.021
Let me think.
Let me think.
I can get this open.

1:10:25.054 --> 1:10:26.690
How?
I don't know.
Just give me a second.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:29.459
Hutch. Hutch!
It's just a... What?

1:10:29.493 --> 1:10:31.528
We don't have the time!

1:10:31.561 --> 1:10:34.331
Just think about it.
You gotta finish this.

1:10:35.899 --> 1:10:38.101
No.

1:10:38.134 --> 1:10:39.803
Listen.
I'm not leaving you.

1:10:39.836 --> 1:10:41.438
Hutch.

1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:46.276
I want you to go.

1:10:48.345 --> 1:10:51.114
You're our only chance.

1:10:51.147 --> 1:10:52.749
OK?

1:10:54.651 --> 1:10:55.785
This can't be happening.

1:10:55.819 --> 1:10:57.654
Well, it is.

1:11:12.302 --> 1:11:14.003
I won't let her take you.

1:11:16.005 --> 1:11:17.807
I know.

1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:25.815
You be careful of that.

1:11:31.988 --> 1:11:33.490
OK.

1:12:21.270 --> 1:12:24.808
He loves me,

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:28.077
he loves me not.

1:12:32.849 --> 1:12:34.584
He loves me,

1:12:37.353 --> 1:12:40.256
he loves me not.

1:12:40.289 --> 1:12:43.092
He loves me,

1:12:43.126 --> 1:12:45.194
he loves me not.

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:51.267
He loves me...

1:12:53.803 --> 1:12:56.506
Go away!

1:12:56.540 --> 1:12:59.709
Go away!

1:13:18.628 --> 1:13:21.030
No! Go away!

1:13:21.064 --> 1:13:23.600
Hutch!

1:14:25.161 --> 1:14:27.330
The broken mirrors -
why were they shattered?

1:14:27.363 --> 1:14:28.998
She couldn't stand
to see herself grow old.

1:14:29.032 --> 1:14:31.134
It won't break
like the others.

1:14:31.167 --> 1:14:32.802
I think it's made
out of silver or something.

1:15:35.231 --> 1:15:37.300
Mom!

1:15:50.947 --> 1:15:53.683
Hutch!
Come on! Move!

1:15:53.717 --> 1:15:55.852
Come on, hurry.
Move! Come on, man!

1:15:55.885 --> 1:15:57.787
Move!
Hutch!

1:15:57.821 --> 1:15:59.789
Come on.
Come on, man! Come on!

1:16:04.628 --> 1:16:06.763
Come on!
Come on, Hutch!

1:16:57.180 --> 1:17:00.216
Killer.

1:17:37.987 --> 1:17:40.790
Come to me, clouds.

1:17:40.824 --> 1:17:45.061
May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

1:17:45.094 --> 1:17:47.797
Let the cover of night
bear witness

1:17:47.831 --> 1:17:49.465
and destroy those who resist

1:17:49.498 --> 1:17:51.901
so they shall harm me not.

1:17:51.935 --> 1:17:54.470
Let the blood
of many cleanse me,

1:17:54.503 --> 1:17:57.540
preserving beauty eternal,

1:17:57.573 --> 1:18:01.010
I pray you.
