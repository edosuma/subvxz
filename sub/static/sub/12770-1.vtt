00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.875 --> 00:09.041
ADDISON:
My mother always used to say,

00:09.083 --> 00:12.625
"People plan, and God laughs."

00:12.667 --> 00:16.041
Which is funny, because Bizzy
didn't even believe in God.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.041
MAN:
Do you?

00:18.083 --> 00:19.542
I...

00:20.625 --> 00:22.542
I don't know.

00:22.583 --> 00:26.125
I mean, the idea of something
bigger than me, uh, God

00:26.166 --> 00:29.458
being in charge of my life
is somehow comforting, I guess.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.625
But it's also unsettling.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.875
I think, if there is a god,

00:34.917 --> 00:37.750
he doesn't want
to hurt us or judge us.

00:37.792 --> 00:41.208
Hurting and judging
are distinctly human traits.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.250
It's a letter
from the medical board.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.000
They're suspending my license.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.750
They're coming after
the practice.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.625
ADDISON: I met a guy.
JAKE: We'll have to tell

00:49.667 --> 00:50.792
who we are sooner or later.

00:50.834 --> 00:52.417
I can't come to Fiji.
Why not?

00:52.458 --> 00:54.000
What do you have
holding you here?

00:54.041 --> 00:55.166
AMELIA:
Look, I just slipped.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.041
Starting now,
your surgical privileges

00:57.083 --> 00:59.000
at this hospital are revoked.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.625
If you run away again--
Again?

01:00.667 --> 01:02.500
You dropped Lucas in my lap
and you ran!

01:02.542 --> 01:03.834
VIOLET:
I'm going.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.583
( grunting )

01:07.834 --> 01:09.375
ADDISON:
I missed you.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.667
I missed you too.

01:10.709 --> 01:12.417
I'm still gonna want a baby,
Sam.

01:14.959 --> 01:18.041
I wanna believe in a god who's--

01:18.083 --> 01:21.667
Who's like the kind of parent
I hope to be one day.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.667
Accepting,

01:23.709 --> 01:26.208
loving, forgiving, present.

01:27.542 --> 01:31.667
I mean, life's too hard
to believe in the other kind.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.083
Don't you think?

01:33.125 --> 01:35.667
( Pete gasping )

01:48.333 --> 01:51.375
( tense theme playing )

02:10.709 --> 02:13.041
( upbeat hip-hop music playing )

02:13.083 --> 02:15.333
( both breathing heavily )

02:15.375 --> 02:17.792
Wow. That was, uh...

02:17.834 --> 02:19.041
Different.
Better.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.542
Amazing.
That was amazing.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.542
Why did we break up?

02:23.583 --> 02:26.083
You really want me
to remind you?
No.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.750
No, I don't. Ha, ha.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.750
Okay.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.208
( phone ringing )

02:34.792 --> 02:36.000
Sam.
Mm. No, just ignore it.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.125
Stop, stop.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.041
No, Sam, it's the hospital.
I'm not on call.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.166
Are you sure?
Yes.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.458
Yeah? Oh.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.333
This is Dr. Bennett.

02:50.959 --> 02:53.208
Okay. I'll be right there.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.417
( sighs )

03:02.166 --> 03:04.417
Take it off.

03:04.458 --> 03:06.375
I'm gonna need another drink
for that.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.583
I can make that happen.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.166
Bitch, get off the bar.
We're not in Vegas.

03:10.208 --> 03:13.542
Hey. Whoa. Hey.
No need for name calling.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.667
We can all be friends.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.625
Come dance with me, sister.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.000
Guys like
a little girl on girl.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.166
See...

03:25.208 --> 03:27.583
Now I see a need
for name calling...

03:27.625 --> 03:29.208
Bitch.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.709
( crowd gasps )

03:33.375 --> 03:35.750
( breathing heavily )

03:35.792 --> 03:37.166
Son of a...

03:40.500 --> 03:42.458
Y'all suck as a mosh pit.

03:45.667 --> 03:49.041
WOMAN ( on PA ):
Attention, passengers
on Flight 531 to New York,

03:49.083 --> 03:51.625
we apologize
for the ongoing delay.

03:51.667 --> 03:52.917
We're working to correct
an issue

03:52.959 --> 03:54.667
with the hydraulics system

03:54.709 --> 03:56.500
and will announce
a new departure time

03:56.542 --> 03:58.208
as soon as we have one.
Thank you.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.375
JOANNA:
Maybe the delay is a sign.

04:00.417 --> 04:02.458
No, it's not.
We made the right decision.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.792
It's time to go home.

04:03.834 --> 04:05.208
Oh, really?

04:05.250 --> 04:07.000
JOANNA:
I don't know. I feel like

04:07.041 --> 04:08.667
I should go back
to my mother's house.

04:08.709 --> 04:10.291
DAVID:
Come on, Jo.
You don't throw away

04:10.333 --> 04:13.083
12 years
of marriage over one fight.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.625
Trust me.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.500
You'll see.

04:17.542 --> 04:20.083
Okay? We'll...
We'll work it out

04:20.125 --> 04:22.125
like we always do.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.750
This time is different.
You know that.

04:24.792 --> 04:27.000
This time, I don't know
if we can fix it.

04:31.709 --> 04:33.458
( EKG flatlining )

04:33.500 --> 04:34.750
Damn it. Again.

04:34.792 --> 04:37.083
( defibrillator powering up )

04:37.125 --> 04:38.875
Sam.
SAM: Not now.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.834
Sam, how long has he been down?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.208
Forty-five minutes.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.834
CHARLOTTE: You have to call it.
No.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.750
Sam, call it.

04:46.792 --> 04:49.875
( tense theme playing )

04:56.542 --> 04:58.000
Time of death...

05:01.208 --> 05:02.959
Ten seventeen.

05:05.083 --> 05:08.083
( dramatic theme playing )

05:08.125 --> 05:10.417
( grunting )

05:11.959 --> 05:14.583
( suspenseful theme playing )

05:24.583 --> 05:27.041
Thanks for coming in.
Duncan was on call

05:27.083 --> 05:29.500
but he got stuck in the OR
doing an aortic valve.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.125
No problem.
Uh, if you're good here

05:31.166 --> 05:33.208
I was thinking about
heading back home. Hey.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.583
I didn't know you were--

05:34.625 --> 05:36.583
Yeah. Uh, I have a mother--

05:36.625 --> 05:38.542
With triplets,
went into early labor.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.834
And they already
have twins,

05:39.875 --> 05:41.375
so I'm going to retire

05:41.417 --> 05:42.542
on that family.
Hmm.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.709
Did you deliver them yet?

05:43.750 --> 05:45.041
No, no,
she hasn't dilated yet.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.709
Okay,
so you're still waiting.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.709
Because I was thinking,
I think I'm done for the night.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.542
Yeah.
Well, good news.

05:51.583 --> 05:55.333
Pete never showed up for his
shift, so, Sam, you can fill in.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.041
You can keep Addison company
all night.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.125
SAM:
Okay.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.792
As long as you
stop pretending

05:59.834 --> 06:01.583
that you two
aren't back together,

06:01.625 --> 06:03.041
because you can't sell it,

06:03.083 --> 06:04.583
and it's making me
uncomfortable.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.000
( Cooper chuckles )

06:08.083 --> 06:09.583
Wait. What happened
to Pete now?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.166
Oh, he's probably upset
because Violet went to New York.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.667
COOPER:
What?

06:13.709 --> 06:15.125
Yeah, I saw her
at the airport.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.625
What were you doing
at the airport?

06:16.667 --> 06:20.041
I was, uh,
saying goodbye to Nai.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.041
Violet just left?
She didn't say anything?

06:22.083 --> 06:24.750
To you. I'm sure she had
some things to say to Pete.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.041
Which is probably why
he's upset.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.458
He could've been upset here.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.041
Lord knows there are enough
people around to cheer him up.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.041
Pete's hard to cheer up.
He can get really dark.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.375
Maybe I should
go over there

06:33.417 --> 06:35.667
and see if I can get him
out for a drink.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.041
Give him some time, take Lucas
out for ice cream or something.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.792
Either way, have a ball.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.500
I'll be here,
with Sam and Addison.

06:46.917 --> 06:48.667
I need coffee.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.875
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.000
( Joanna crying )

07:08.083 --> 07:09.500
God.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.542
Thank you.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.542
I'm sorry. I don't usually
melt down in public like this.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.625
Oh, please.

07:25.667 --> 07:29.709
Airports are like hospitals
or high school dances.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.125
Somebody's crying somewhere.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.709
I'm-- I'm Violet Turner.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.375
Joanna Gibbs.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.792
I heard you
talking to your husband.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.250
I'm so sorry.
I never eavesdrop.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.000
What are you gonna do
in a place like this?

07:45.041 --> 07:48.000
No, it's-- It's fine.
We're fine.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.041
I'm sure.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.125
And I keep telling myself
the same thing.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.083
I wrote a book, and I'm going to
New York for this book tour,

07:58.125 --> 08:00.083
but I left my son
and my husband at home.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.041
And that's created
a little bit of...

08:02.083 --> 08:03.542
Drama.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.959
But I guess
that's what marriage is, right?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.417
You fight, you work it out.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.625
Rinse. Repeat.
Ha, ha.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.041
Yeah,
sometimes it feels like that.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.709
You just
have to remind yourself

08:16.750 --> 08:18.542
it moves the relationship
forward.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.291
Unless you're always fighting
about the same thing.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.041
( tender folk music playing )

08:23.083 --> 08:25.709
I'm a lawyer.
I work horrendous hours.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.542
And David, my husband...

08:27.583 --> 08:30.000
He doesn't get it.
JOANNA: Ahem.

08:30.041 --> 08:33.542
No. He used to.

08:33.583 --> 08:37.041
He's always been incredibly
supportive.

08:37.083 --> 08:41.834
You know, most men put
their own careers first.

08:41.875 --> 08:45.625
David held down two jobs
to pay for my law school.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.750
And then he listened to me bitch
for eight years

08:48.792 --> 08:50.041
while I worked round-the-clock

08:50.083 --> 08:52.542
trying to make partner
at the firm, heh.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.000
And then when I finally did,

08:54.041 --> 08:57.583
I think it meant as much to him
as it did to me.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.458
You don't see that often
in husbands.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.000
I know.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.333
The problem is,

09:05.375 --> 09:08.583
things haven't gotten
any easier at the firm,

09:08.625 --> 09:11.500
and all of a sudden,
he's not like that.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.291
I don't know.
Something in him changed.

09:18.417 --> 09:20.250
I came out here to...

09:20.291 --> 09:22.792
Get away, I guess.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.166
Well, sometimes distance
can give you

09:25.208 --> 09:27.250
a little perspective
on a relationship.

09:27.291 --> 09:28.667
Yeah.

09:28.709 --> 09:32.125
When David flew out,
he was so apologetic.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.041
I know he's right.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.583
In the heat of the moment,

09:37.625 --> 09:41.041
you say or do things
you wouldn't...

09:41.083 --> 09:42.834
When you say "do things"...

09:44.834 --> 09:46.333
Wh--? What happened?

09:48.917 --> 09:50.542
Last time we fought

09:53.333 --> 09:54.792
David hit me.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.959
( Joanna sighs )

09:59.583 --> 10:01.333
Come on, Pete.
I know you're in there.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.375
I saw your car out front.
Come on, man.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.417
I also know that Violet

10:07.458 --> 10:10.208
left for New York today
and that that sucks.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.458
I brought some beer.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.917
I thought I could come in,
and we could commiserate.

10:13.959 --> 10:15.041
Or I could leave the beer,

10:15.083 --> 10:17.250
and I'll take Lucas
out for a little bit.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.542
( Lucas shouting )

10:18.583 --> 10:20.542
Lucas?

10:20.583 --> 10:21.542
( knocking on door )

10:21.583 --> 10:22.875
Pete!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.709
Look, man, I really do not
want to see your ass again,

10:27.750 --> 10:31.208
but I am a little freaked out,
so I'm coming in, okay?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.000
Pete, I'm coming in, okay?

10:36.917 --> 10:38.834
Pete. Pete.

10:46.583 --> 10:49.125
All right.
326 Las Brisas. Come now.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.959
Okay, stay with me, Pete.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.959
No, it's his house.
His name is Pete Wilder.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.959
I think it's a heart attack.
I got no pulse. I'm starting--

10:57.000 --> 10:58.500
Four, five, six.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.709
Okay, stay with me, Pete.
Ambulance is on the way.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.000
Lucas?

11:02.041 --> 11:04.041
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.041
Lucas, come out here, buddy.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.375
Twenty.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.208
Lucas, I know it's scary,

11:09.250 --> 11:11.792
but we're just taking care
of your dad, okay?

11:13.083 --> 11:14.625
( Lucas whimpers )

11:14.667 --> 11:15.625
Hey.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.333
You okay? I know it's scary,

11:18.375 --> 11:19.500
but we're helping your dad,
okay?

11:19.542 --> 11:21.083
He's gonna be okay. I promise.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.583
Come on, Pete. Come on, man.

11:23.625 --> 11:25.000
( Cooper breathing heavily )

11:28.667 --> 11:29.792
( sighs )

11:31.834 --> 11:34.542
There he is,
my knight in shining armor.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.458
You okay?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.041
AMELIA:
Fell down, need stitches,

11:38.083 --> 11:39.959
didn't think I should drive.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.542
Thank you for coming.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
Yeah.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.542
You didn't think
you should drive,

11:44.583 --> 11:45.959
or the bartender
took your keys?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.583
Tomato, tomato.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.041
Amelia, y--
You're drunk.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.000
Not quite.
I was on my way to being drunk

11:52.041 --> 11:54.250
when all of the bleeding
interrupted my evening.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.041
What happened to AA, huh?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.041
My problem was with pills,
Sheldon, not booze.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.875
Tomato, tomato.

11:59.917 --> 12:02.041
You tomatoed me back.
That's clever.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.667
I like that. I like you.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.834
Well, I like you too,
but I'm worried about you.

12:05.875 --> 12:06.834
Oh, please don't be.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.083
You're a drug addict
using a drug.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.792
Just because
it comes in liquid form

12:09.834 --> 12:11.375
doesn't mean
it's not a drug.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.291
And addicts using drugs
have consequences.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.291
For example, you need
stitches in your hand--

12:15.333 --> 12:18.000
Your Hopkins-trained
neurosurgeon hand.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.291
And that-- That is a potentially
severe consequence, and I--

12:22.417 --> 12:23.583
Amelia.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.875
Relax, Sheldon. I'm not
trying to sleep with you.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.291
I needed you
to shut up so that

12:27.333 --> 12:28.834
you could give me
a ride to the hospital

12:28.875 --> 12:30.625
and I won't bleed to death
in the street.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.041
Could you do that for me?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.041
Yeah.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.542
I'll lecture you more later.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.750
I figured.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.750
VIOLET:
Has he ever hit you before?

12:47.792 --> 12:49.000
No. Never. No.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.959
His hours are getting
cut back at work.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.667
Mine are getting worse,
so he's always home, stewing.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.458
I know it's a cliché,

12:59.500 --> 13:03.750
but it really was at least
partially my fault.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.875
Do you really believe that?

13:07.667 --> 13:11.375
We were supposed to go
for a run in the park...

13:11.417 --> 13:13.917
And at the last minute, a client
wanted a conference call.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.375
Not the first time
this happened.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.291
But we just

13:18.333 --> 13:19.750
fell into our same pattern.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.458
He got mad.
I got defensive.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.583
We ended up fighting
for so long

13:23.625 --> 13:26.709
that I was going to miss
the call anyway,

13:26.750 --> 13:28.917
( sighs )

13:28.959 --> 13:32.709
so I texted my assistant
while he was talking.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.750
I know it drives him crazy,
but I did it anyway.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.667
And he reacted...

13:37.709 --> 13:39.125
Badly.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.041
So you came out here.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.125
See my mother.

13:44.166 --> 13:47.709
And what does she have to say
about what happened?

13:47.750 --> 13:50.417
She adores David.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.333
I couldn't bring myself
to tell her.

13:53.375 --> 13:56.083
Do you have any good friends
in New York?

13:56.125 --> 13:57.500
Great ones, actually.

13:57.542 --> 14:01.041
I have a group from college
and law school,

14:01.083 --> 14:03.709
plus some great women
at work.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.333
Have you told any of them
what happened?

14:08.750 --> 14:10.000
You haven't told anyone.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.834
Things like this

14:15.875 --> 14:18.583
are not supposed to happen
to women like me.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.458
( Joanna sighs )

14:23.500 --> 14:24.667
( ambulance sirens wailing )

14:24.709 --> 14:26.625
SAM: How's he doing?
COOPER: Pulse is thready.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.625
Hasn't regained consciousness.
I'll take Lucas.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.583
CHARLOTTE:
Know how long he's been down?
You get ahold of Violet?

14:31.625 --> 14:33.000
I think she's in the air.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.583
You give him antiarrhythmics?
We bolused him times 2.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.041
All right, I need an EKG,
Chem-20, enzymes, and a CBC.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.542
He's on the monitors.
All right, give it to me.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.041
He's having trouble breathing.
Need to control his airway.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.041
I'll intubate.
MAN: I got the chart here.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.458
All right, ST elevation
in the anterior leads.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.583
He's having an acute MI.
How's it coming, Coop?

14:50.625 --> 14:53.250
I can't visualize the cords.
CHARLOTTE: He's in v-fib.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.792
All right. Almost there.
Almost there.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.458
Charge them to 360.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.792
( defibrillator powering up )

14:57.834 --> 14:59.458
SAM:
Clear.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
CHARLOTTE:
Cooper.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.041
SAM: You okay?
I'm all right.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.375
SAM:
He's back in sinus.
Get him to the cath lab

15:04.417 --> 15:05.834
and open those blocked arteries.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.250
Go. Go, go, go.
MAN: Come on. Come on. Let's go.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.500
I'm okay.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.667
This is very MacGyver of you.
Shut up.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.709
You gonna fashion a bomb out of
nothing but your bra strap

15:16.750 --> 15:18.041
and that suture kit?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.291
Stop thinking about
my bra strap, Sheldon.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.709
Yeah, actually, I was thinking
that the ER would be

15:22.750 --> 15:24.458
a more suitable place
for sutures.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.542
Why don't we page Dr. Freud,

15:25.583 --> 15:27.333
ask him why you talked about
my underwear?

15:27.375 --> 15:28.959
Do you always use
sexual innuendo

15:29.000 --> 15:30.625
to deflect potential conflict,
or is...

15:30.667 --> 15:33.250
No, not always.
Only with men.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.291
Could you hold this?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.041
( sighs )

15:37.083 --> 15:38.291
( breathing heavily )

15:41.083 --> 15:43.291
( both shouting )

15:43.333 --> 15:45.041
Why aren't we in the ER?

15:45.083 --> 15:48.291
Because interns do sutures
in ERs and interns suck.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.041
But why else?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.125
Amelia.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.041
I don't want to run into
Charlotte, okay?

15:55.083 --> 15:57.667
She'll start quoting
the AA big book at me

15:57.709 --> 15:59.041
and I am in no mood.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.291
I see. So sexual innuendo
for men,

16:02.333 --> 16:03.667
and with women, it's...

16:03.709 --> 16:05.125
Avoidance.
Got it.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.667
And you're planning to suture
your hand yourself?

16:07.709 --> 16:09.375
Well, I was hoping
you could help.

16:09.417 --> 16:10.917
( Sheldon laughs )

16:10.959 --> 16:13.542
I'm a shrink. I suck worse
than the interns. No.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.041
( sighs )

16:16.083 --> 16:18.041
In that case, yes,

16:18.083 --> 16:21.583
I'm planning to suture
my own hand.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.375
But you have to give me
the shot to numb it.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.041
Can you handle that or is
my bra strap too distracting?

16:27.083 --> 16:28.208
Oh.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.583
Hey.
Hey.

16:35.625 --> 16:36.750
Where's Pete?

16:36.792 --> 16:40.041
They, uh, took him to, um...

16:40.083 --> 16:41.709
The cath lab.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.625
How's he doing?

16:43.667 --> 16:46.834
Sam had to, uh, paddle him
to get his...

16:46.875 --> 16:49.417
His rhythm back,
but, you know, fine.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.625
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

16:51.667 --> 16:55.375
Uh, either Pete has
a really narrow trachea,

16:55.417 --> 16:59.709
or somebody handed me
the wrong size ET tube

16:59.750 --> 17:01.959
because I wasn't quite done
intubating him

17:02.041 --> 17:03.667
when Sam yelled "clear."

17:03.709 --> 17:05.041
Oh.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.208
And I got a little...
Oh, Coop.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.625
I-- I'm just a little...
Spacey?

17:09.667 --> 17:11.041
Uh... Yeah.
Tingly?

17:11.083 --> 17:12.583
( chuckles )

17:14.458 --> 17:16.875
I remember my first year
residency,

17:16.917 --> 17:19.750
I scrubbed in on
an abdominal hysterectomy,

17:19.792 --> 17:22.041
and, uh, I was standing
down by the patient's knee

17:22.083 --> 17:24.041
so I had to lean in
to get a better look.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.583
Midway through,
her heart stopped.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.375
I remember the attending

17:27.417 --> 17:29.458
grabbing the paddles,
calling "clear."

17:29.500 --> 17:31.041
I lifted my hands up,

17:31.083 --> 17:34.583
but my entire stomach
was still touching her legs.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.542
( both chuckling )

17:36.583 --> 17:38.041
LUCAS:
Mommy.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.583
( tender theme playing )

17:39.625 --> 17:41.375
COOPER:
When I got to the house

17:41.417 --> 17:43.917
he was under the dining room
table, hiding.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.000
He saw?

17:50.041 --> 17:53.792
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.041
We gotta figure out a way
to get in touch with Violet.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.041
It's not like I didn't
want to tell somebody.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.625
I-- I don't know how
to talk about it.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.542
You're doing great.
Because you're a stranger.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.792
But my mother, my friends--
I'd be too embarrassed.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.625
Everyone knows

18:17.667 --> 18:19.542
Joanna Gibbs, Phi Beta Kappa,

18:19.583 --> 18:22.041
order of the coif,
youngest partner at the firm.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.834
If I tell them
what happened,

18:23.875 --> 18:26.917
I'll just be Joanna Gibbs,
battered wife.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.959
Here he comes.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.542
Go to the ladies' room.
What?

18:30.583 --> 18:33.041
Go to the ladies' room.
I'll meet you there.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.041
The coffee in here
smelled kind of grim

18:35.083 --> 18:36.417
so I went to the terminal.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.875
I got you a vanilla latte
in case--

18:37.917 --> 18:39.834
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.000
Jo, are you all right?

18:44.041 --> 18:46.041
Is she okay?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.291
I don't know.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.625
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:02.083 --> 19:03.333
The vessel's tight.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.583
CHARLOTTE:
Having runs of V-tach.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.041
Lucas.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.875
SAM:
Having difficulty inserting
the stent.

19:07.917 --> 19:11.000
Lucas.
He's fine. He's with Addison.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.166
Sam. Is his face...?

19:14.208 --> 19:16.709
It's not good.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.542
Muscle paralysis,
right side.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.291
Either his heart was stopped
long enough

19:20.333 --> 19:22.208
that he has brain damage
or there's a bleed.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.834
We should page Amelia.
Let's pray this is reversible.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.542
Get the neuro on call here now.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.834
It should be Amelia.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.583
We'll take whoever's closest.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.583
The catheter dissected
his coronary artery.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.625
He's bleeding into his chest.
Start compressions.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.208
We lost his pulse.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.041
We gotta get him to the OR,
get him on bypass.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.709
CHARLOTTE:
We're not gonna have time.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.041
SAM:
Just do it. Just do it. Go.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.750
CHARLOTTE:
Sam, his eyes.

19:42.792 --> 19:45.125
There's just enough circulation
to perfuse his brain.

19:45.166 --> 19:48.000
Don't stop.
I'm trying!

19:50.417 --> 19:52.041
Mm. Is that it?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.542
Yep.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.041
( sighs )

19:55.083 --> 19:56.583
How are you? Y--? You okay?

19:56.625 --> 19:58.375
Nothing will sober you up

19:58.417 --> 20:01.041
like repeatedly puncturing
your own flesh with sharp metal.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.166
Oh, yeah.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.041
I need a drink.
You wanna come?

20:05.083 --> 20:06.291
( laughing )

20:12.834 --> 20:14.750
How about I take you
to a meeting instead?

20:14.792 --> 20:17.625
How about you stop sounding
exactly like Charlotte?

20:17.667 --> 20:19.041
( phone buzzing )

20:19.083 --> 20:20.458
Are you on call?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.417
Were you drinking
while you were on call?

20:22.458 --> 20:24.417
God, Sheldon.
No, I'm not on call, but--

20:24.458 --> 20:26.291
But they are
paging me anyway.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.625
Amelia.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.250
What's going on?

20:29.291 --> 20:31.083
Did Charlotte call you?

20:31.125 --> 20:33.667
No, but I just got a page
from Sam.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.041
SHELDON:
Why do you have Lucas?

20:35.083 --> 20:37.083
You guys, what's going on?

20:38.542 --> 20:40.000
( door opens )

20:42.083 --> 20:43.333
Hi.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.500
Are you okay?

20:46.542 --> 20:49.041
David is not a violent man.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.792
This was just a fluke.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.083
But you left him
to go somewhere safe.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.291
Do you have any reason
to doubt that instinct?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.667
You don't understand
the relationship

21:01.709 --> 21:03.750
that David and I have.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.583
Maybe not.

21:07.792 --> 21:11.917
But I do know what it feels like
to be the victim of violence.

21:11.959 --> 21:14.875
I know how it feels when
the confidence and security

21:14.917 --> 21:17.542
that you thought you had
goes out the window.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.834
And if you ever want
that back

21:20.875 --> 21:24.291
that sense of control
over your own life,

21:24.333 --> 21:28.041
you can't just not tell anyone
and pretend it didn't happen.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.667
Nobody ever really gets
to control their life.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.041
You meet a guy,

21:33.083 --> 21:34.542
you fall in love,

21:34.583 --> 21:37.792
you make all these plans,
and then

21:37.834 --> 21:39.583
your husband's career
doesn't

21:39.625 --> 21:42.125
work out
the way he thought it would.

21:42.166 --> 21:46.000
He gets frustrated and angry
because who wouldn't?

21:49.083 --> 21:51.041
I know how that sounds.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.750
But marriage is complicated.

21:53.792 --> 21:56.166
And you're not inside
this one.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.667
You make sacrifices
to get through

21:58.709 --> 21:59.917
He hit you.
the hard times.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.667
That's not a sacrifice,
that's abuse.

22:01.709 --> 22:03.375
We have to stop.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.333
Because really,

22:05.375 --> 22:07.834
what qualifies you to define
my relationship

22:07.875 --> 22:09.000
and tell me what to do?

22:12.583 --> 22:13.834
You seem like
a very nice person,

22:13.875 --> 22:15.500
Heh.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.500
and I appreciate
your concern.

22:17.542 --> 22:19.583
I do.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.667
But this is just
none of your business.

22:25.959 --> 22:28.417
I have to-- I have to
get back to my husband.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.000
Does Violet know?

22:34.041 --> 22:35.333
She's on a plane
to New York.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.208
I called, I e-mailed,
I texted.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.542
I don't have good news.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.417
Pete's pressure keeps
bottoming out.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.041
Sam took him to the OR
to put him on bypass.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.250
What are you doing here?

22:45.667 --> 22:47.000
I got a page
that Sam needed me.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.583
Is Pete having neuro
complications?

22:48.625 --> 22:50.542
Slurred speech
and a facial droop.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.208
Probably a CVA.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.625
Oh, God.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.041
CHARLOTTE:
Buddle's on his way.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.750
Well, I'm here now.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.333
What happened to your hand?

22:58.375 --> 23:00.959
My hand's fine.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.667
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.

23:02.709 --> 23:04.000
Amelia.

23:06.417 --> 23:07.583
What happened to her hand?

23:07.625 --> 23:09.875
She cut it.
It needed some stitches.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.166
It's... It's fine.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.041
AMELIA: What's happening?
SAM: He's on bypass.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.792
He's gonna need
a 4-vessel graft.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.417
He may have a bleed.
AMELIA: Why wait?

23:20.458 --> 23:23.458
SAM:
Dye. He had
two long sessions of CPR.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.458
The high-peak pressure might

23:24.500 --> 23:26.041
have ruptured
one of his vessels.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.041
There. If I get in now,
I can clamp it.

23:28.083 --> 23:30.709
He's already on bypass. I have
four arteries to graft first.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.083
AMELIA:
By the time you're done,

23:32.125 --> 23:33.625
Pete'll be lucky
if he can drool.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.917
Look, you take care
of your part, I'll do mine.

23:35.959 --> 23:38.625
11-blade...
Prep for a left-side craniotomy.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.041
Clear the fluoroscope.
I'm gonna need a craniotome,

23:41.083 --> 23:43.250
a joker, and some bone wax.
CHARLOTTE: Stop.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.041
Amelia, I said stop.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.250
( dramatic theme playing )

23:59.667 --> 24:01.875
You know,
we should switch seats.

24:01.917 --> 24:05.000
That's where I was sitting
for the Violet-Katie thing.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.875
And?

24:07.917 --> 24:10.041
Well, that turned out okay,

24:10.083 --> 24:11.875
so I should sit there again.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.875
And this is where I was sitting
when Dell died.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.417
Oh, well, even more so.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.333
I wasn't here
either of those times.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.625
I was operating, so...

24:21.834 --> 24:24.583
No, okay, you can stay there,
but you and me.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.250
How do you think
Sam and Amelia are doing?

24:32.291 --> 24:34.041
I think Sam and Amelia

24:34.083 --> 24:36.041
are exactly who
I'd want in there, but...

24:36.083 --> 24:37.583
But what?

24:37.625 --> 24:39.917
Having everyone count on you
to save the life

24:39.959 --> 24:41.542
of someone they love,

24:41.583 --> 24:43.041
trying to set aside
your own feelings,

24:43.083 --> 24:45.375
it's hard, that's all.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.792
Hey, Lucas. You hungry?
Mm-hm.

24:48.834 --> 24:51.000
Yeah? Let's try to go find
something good to eat.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.375
There we go.

24:55.417 --> 24:56.959
Call me if you hear anything,
okay?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.959
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.500
Any word from Violet?
COOPER: No.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.959
But this says
her plane hasn't left.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.792
I mean, she's still gotta be
at the airport, right?

25:09.542 --> 25:11.834
Can I do anything?

25:13.166 --> 25:14.375
What're you doing?

25:14.417 --> 25:16.041
AMELIA:
Pete's got an arterial bleed.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.041
If I don't clamp--
Buddle's ten minutes out.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.583
He doesn't have ten minutes.
What's going on?

25:20.625 --> 25:22.000
CHARLOTTE:
She cut her hand.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.583
But I'm fine.
Are you?

25:25.625 --> 25:27.542
Charlotte, I'm fine.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.542
You can say that--

25:29.583 --> 25:32.166
SAM:
Whatever's going on between
you two, now is not the time.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.583
Amelia, can you cut?

25:35.166 --> 25:37.041
It's my left hand.
I'm a righty.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.291
Okay, then.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.208
( tender rock music playing )

25:41.250 --> 25:43.083
( drill whirring )

25:47.709 --> 25:51.041
ADDISON:
I know this has been
a scary night.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.375
And there's so many things
that have happened

25:53.417 --> 25:54.834
that you shouldn't have...

25:54.875 --> 25:57.250
Had to see. It's not fair.

25:59.417 --> 26:02.291
But you have your juice now.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.917
so hopefully,
that's all that matters, huh?

26:05.959 --> 26:07.667
So your daddy's gonna be okay.

26:07.709 --> 26:11.041
He's got great doctors
working with him.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.709
I think he's gonna be okay.

26:13.750 --> 26:17.250
And your mommy is gonna be here
very soon, so that's good.

26:17.291 --> 26:18.500
Right?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.500
But you know what?

26:21.542 --> 26:23.583
Right now

26:23.625 --> 26:25.959
I'm glad
that I'm here with you.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.709
WOMAN ( on PA ):
Attention passengers
on Flight 531 to New York.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.959
The mechanical problem
has been resolved.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.083
You should proceed
back to your gate.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.250
Boarding will begin
in 15 minutes.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.625
Thank you.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.875
Okay, you're right.
You did not ask my opinion,

26:50.917 --> 26:53.041
this is not my business,
but just-- Don't do this.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.500
Don't get on the plane.
What?

26:54.542 --> 26:56.709
I do know what it's like
to be in a complicated marriage,

26:56.750 --> 26:58.250
but what's going on
is another thing.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.667
Jo, why is she--?

26:59.709 --> 27:02.333
and you're not ready to go home.
This is ridiculous.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.500
If you can't talk to your mom
or friends, talk to me,

27:04.542 --> 27:06.041
but don't go.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.041
Okay, we're done here.
We're done. Come on.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.709
Excuse me,
are you Dr. Violet Turner?

27:09.750 --> 27:12.000
I have an emergency call for you
from Dr. Freedman.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.500
Coop?

27:18.083 --> 27:20.000
Oh, God.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.792
Violet?

27:28.625 --> 27:30.000
Full belly.

27:30.041 --> 27:31.959
That's good.

27:38.083 --> 27:40.625
I know he's scared,

27:40.667 --> 27:43.417
but he can't really understand
what's going on, can he?

27:43.458 --> 27:46.750
Well,
it's hard to tell.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.333
Kids absorb a lot.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.625
And even if he doesn't realize
what's happening around him,

27:50.667 --> 27:52.667
Lucas feels the crisis.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.000
What'll it do to him?

27:57.250 --> 27:58.917
Well, usually,
there's some regression

27:58.959 --> 28:01.500
in eating and toileting,

28:01.542 --> 28:03.375
and periods
where he can't be consoled.

28:03.417 --> 28:05.375
Is there anything else
that we should be doing?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.375
We're doing it.
You're doing it.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.375
He needs to be around
familiar people,

28:09.417 --> 28:11.667
places and smells.

28:13.083 --> 28:17.000
More than anything,
right now he... He needs Violet.

28:20.625 --> 28:23.625
What if Pete doesn't make it?
I mean...

28:25.250 --> 28:28.625
It's a cataclysmic event
for a child.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.458
One that we shouldn't even think
about unless we need to.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.041
CHARLOTTE:
I didn't have a choice, did I?

28:36.083 --> 28:38.458
I mean, Amelia was there.
It couldn't wait.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.250
You did not have a choice.

28:41.291 --> 28:42.458
And, you know, hopefully,

28:42.500 --> 28:44.250
if she had any doubt
that she could do it,

28:44.291 --> 28:45.917
she wouldn't have
pushed so hard.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.792
Amelia never has any doubts.
That's what I'm worried about.

28:48.834 --> 28:51.709
But it's Pete.
You did not have a choice.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.041
What if one of us died?

28:57.083 --> 28:59.041
Are you seriously asking me
this right now?

28:59.083 --> 29:02.041
When I was 14 and my dad
had that heart attack,

29:02.083 --> 29:04.667
it scared the hell out of me.
But the worst part

29:06.083 --> 29:08.500
was I remember being
in the hospital with my mom,

29:08.542 --> 29:09.583
and she kept saying--

29:09.625 --> 29:12.917
Not even to me,
she just kept repeating,

29:12.959 --> 29:14.917
"I don't want
to be without him.

29:14.959 --> 29:16.458
I can't be without him."

29:16.500 --> 29:18.542
And I just...

29:20.083 --> 29:22.417
Haven't you ever
thought about it?

29:22.458 --> 29:24.041
Ever? Yes.

29:24.083 --> 29:28.417
But at this moment it's not you
and me I'm worried about.

29:28.458 --> 29:31.500
Would you
get married again?

29:31.542 --> 29:33.750
Would you
not want me to?

29:33.792 --> 29:36.500
I don't know. I guess...

29:36.542 --> 29:40.041
I mean, I'd want you to be
happy, so...

29:40.083 --> 29:41.208
You could get married again.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.667
What about me?

29:43.709 --> 29:44.709
I'd want you
to be miserable

29:44.750 --> 29:46.917
every day
for the rest of your life.

29:46.959 --> 29:50.500
You asked.
( phone beeping )

29:50.542 --> 29:52.291
Hello.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.792
Hey, Violet.
Whose phone is this?

29:55.834 --> 29:59.542
No, okay,
he's still in surgery.

29:59.583 --> 30:04.458
I will check myself right now,
okay? I'm checking.

30:04.500 --> 30:07.083
SAM:
Okay, he's ready to come off
pump. You done yet?

30:07.125 --> 30:08.750
AMELIA:
Almost there.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.667
SAM:
I gotta get him off
this pump now, Amelia.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.542
AMELIA:
The vessel's done,
but I still gotta close.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.500
Just take him off.
SAM: Okay.

30:15.542 --> 30:18.041
Arterial off.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.041
Venous off.

30:21.083 --> 30:22.709
( EKG flatlining )

30:24.542 --> 30:26.583
( tense theme playing )

30:30.083 --> 30:31.500
( EKG beeping then Sam sighs )

30:31.542 --> 30:32.792
Okay.

30:32.834 --> 30:35.250
We got him back.
All right. Got him back.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.000
Hey, guys. How's...?

30:38.041 --> 30:39.375
( machine beeping )

30:39.417 --> 30:40.750
AMELIA:
Lost his pressure again.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.709
SAM:
All right, he's in v-fib.
Damn it.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.917
Cooper, I need you to scrub in.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.041
Pete's still in the OR.
Cooper's checking on him.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.750
I'm not gonna wait on Cooper.

30:51.792 --> 30:52.917
Hey, is he--?

30:52.959 --> 30:56.500
He's fine, Violet. Go.
VIOLET: Okay.

30:56.542 --> 30:58.333
( defibrillator powering up )

31:00.250 --> 31:02.458
SAM:
I'm not getting anything.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.750
COOPER: What can I do?
SAM: All right, charge again.

31:04.792 --> 31:06.125
( defibrillator powering up )

31:06.166 --> 31:07.792
It's not working.
COOPER: Sam.

31:07.834 --> 31:09.750
SAM:
Come here. Squeeze.

31:09.792 --> 31:12.792
Give me five cc's of EPI,
one to 1,000.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.792
Come on. Don't be gentle.
Squeeze.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.959
Violet.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.500
( dramatic theme playing )

31:31.875 --> 31:34.667
( mellow theme playing )

31:34.709 --> 31:36.250
He's been in and out of
consciousness,

31:36.291 --> 31:37.792
but the grafts are holding.

31:37.834 --> 31:40.000
His cardiac output
is on target--

31:40.041 --> 31:42.041
And he's gonna be okay?

31:42.083 --> 31:44.041
Yeah.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.834
He's gonna be okay.

31:45.875 --> 31:47.208
( laughing )

31:49.750 --> 31:50.750
( crying )

31:54.083 --> 31:57.625
COOPER:
Recovery's gonna be tough,
but you know that.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.458
And in a couple of weeks,

31:59.500 --> 32:03.083
when you get around to making
those thank-you baskets,

32:03.125 --> 32:05.041
Sam only saved his life once.

32:05.083 --> 32:06.208
I saved it twice.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.667
This is true.
Yep.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.875
Thank you. Both of you.
Mm-hm.

32:12.333 --> 32:16.500
Ugh. What am I supposed to say
to him now, "I'm sorry"?

32:16.542 --> 32:19.709
It sounds so pathetic,
but I do want to apologize--

32:19.750 --> 32:21.333
For what?

32:21.375 --> 32:22.750
If I hadn't argued with him,
then left--

32:22.792 --> 32:24.083
Oh, come on.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.667
You did not cause this.

32:25.709 --> 32:28.458
Violet, you couldn't have
done anything to stop it.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.875
It was bad luck.

32:29.917 --> 32:31.625
Yeah, go see him.
You'll feel better.

32:31.667 --> 32:33.041
Yeah.

32:36.083 --> 32:39.500
Oh, don't be worried if he seems
a little, uh, euphoric.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.750
His hormones are still
a little bit scrambled

32:41.792 --> 32:43.667
from anesthesia and bypass.
Wait a minute.

32:43.709 --> 32:45.667
So you're saying Pete's
in there acting like Mr. Rogers,

32:45.709 --> 32:47.333
but with a zipper scar?
Ooh.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.000
It'll wear off.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.583
You better get in there.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.500
( EKG beeping
and machine hissing )

33:18.458 --> 33:19.583
( in raspy voice ):
Hey.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.750
( chuckles )

33:21.792 --> 33:25.041
Oh, my God.

33:25.083 --> 33:27.000
Oh, you are beautiful.

33:28.583 --> 33:29.959
( laughing )

33:30.000 --> 33:34.041
Oh, and my chest hurts.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.959
Mm.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.709
You had a heart attack.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.917
Sam did a quadruple bypass.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.333
Then you had a brain bleed,
so Amelia had to get in there.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.959
Oh, that explains
the headache.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.959
( laughing )

33:47.000 --> 33:48.583
( groaning )

33:50.583 --> 33:52.041
Ah.

33:52.083 --> 33:57.458
You know what? I know it sounds
odd, but honestly...

33:57.500 --> 33:59.041
I think I'm okay.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.333
Yeah, I--
I think that I can get up now.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.625
Okay, okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe tomorrow--

34:03.667 --> 34:06.041
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Ha, ha.

34:06.083 --> 34:09.041
Oh. Oh.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.583
Huh.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.041
I love you.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.000
( tender theme playing )

34:16.709 --> 34:18.625
What's wrong?

34:18.667 --> 34:21.041
Nothing.

34:21.083 --> 34:24.041
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.750
You're okay, and I'm here,
and...

34:29.083 --> 34:30.625
We fought.

34:31.959 --> 34:33.625
And then I left...

34:33.667 --> 34:35.166
Again.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.667
And it felt like I was going

34:37.709 --> 34:40.500
to something this time,
not just away,

34:40.542 --> 34:42.458
but I know it probably didn't
feel that way to you.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.750
And then Lucas...

34:46.959 --> 34:49.625
If I hadn't gone, maybe none
of this would've happened.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.709
Violet, stop.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.041
I'm okay.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.125
You're okay,
and Lucas is okay,

34:57.166 --> 34:58.792
and that's all that matters,
right?

35:00.792 --> 35:03.667
Hmm. You are so beautiful.

35:03.709 --> 35:05.333
( laughing )

35:05.375 --> 35:07.083
( chuckles )

35:09.959 --> 35:12.625
Hey.

35:12.667 --> 35:13.583
Hey yourself.

35:14.709 --> 35:16.834
So good about Pete, right?

35:16.875 --> 35:19.041
You know, heart's better,
head's fine.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.041
I mean, that leak turned
out to be pretty large,

35:21.083 --> 35:22.625
but I clipped it.

35:22.667 --> 35:26.667
Rocked it is actually
what I did.

35:26.709 --> 35:28.583
Hey, uh...

35:28.625 --> 35:30.792
Thanks for, you know,

35:30.834 --> 35:32.500
saying that you were worried
about my hand.

35:32.542 --> 35:34.500
I appreciate that.

35:34.542 --> 35:36.291
You're not welcome, Amelia.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.583
Okay.

35:40.625 --> 35:41.959
What I mean by that is,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.959
I will not enable you, and I
will not protect you anymore,

35:45.000 --> 35:46.750
not ever again.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.166
It's a onetime deal.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.250
Until you get your
sobriety in hand--

35:50.291 --> 35:51.667
Look, I am not a drunk.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.041
Charlotte,
I have never been a drunk.

35:53.083 --> 35:55.041
The fact that you're trying
to draw a distinction

35:55.083 --> 35:57.166
between booze and drugs
tells me you're in trouble.

35:57.208 --> 35:58.667
Because you know better.

35:58.709 --> 36:01.208
And you been around long enough
to see how this goes.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.625
Alcoholics go out on pills,
they go crazy.

36:03.667 --> 36:05.125
Addicts go out on booze,

36:05.166 --> 36:07.375
and they think they can
handle it, but they can't.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.041
I am fine.
No, you're not.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.333
The fact is, Amelia,

36:10.375 --> 36:12.792
I care about you too much
to trust you right now.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.750
Your privileges
are still suspended.

36:14.792 --> 36:17.583
Next time someone pages you,
don't answer.

36:22.792 --> 36:23.834
( sighs )

36:25.333 --> 36:27.333
Okay, I swear to God,
if you start right now--

36:27.375 --> 36:29.542
I was just gonna offer you
a ride home.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.542
I'd appreciate that.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.166
VIOLET: What's wrong?
I'm mad at you.

36:54.208 --> 36:57.125
I couldn't be mad last night,
but now Pete's stable,

36:57.166 --> 37:00.250
now you've seen him,
so now I can be mad, and I am...

37:00.291 --> 37:01.542
Really mad.

37:01.583 --> 37:03.250
About what?
About you just picking up

37:03.291 --> 37:06.041
and leaving your husband
and your problems.

37:06.083 --> 37:08.709
It almost killed me
the last time you did it,

37:08.750 --> 37:10.291
and you just did it again.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.041
You're right.

37:15.083 --> 37:17.500
COOPER:
Okay, you do not get
to deal with losing your license

37:17.542 --> 37:18.792
by just getting on an airplane.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.625
And you can't
end an argument with Pete

37:20.667 --> 37:22.083
by just leaving town.
You're right.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.375
This is your life.
Stick around and fight for it.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.000
Wait, Cooper.
I said you're right.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.000
And you need to get a new cell
phone with a better battery.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.500
ADDISON: Hey.
Hey.

37:34.750 --> 37:37.709
LUCAS: There's Mama.
Oh. Hi, buddy.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.291
Oh, I missed you so much.

37:40.333 --> 37:42.625
It has been a crazy night.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.709
He's been mostly sleeping,
but he did eat.

37:45.750 --> 37:48.667
I mean, just cookies,
which I know isn't great, but--

37:48.709 --> 37:51.041
Oh, it's fine.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.583
Thank you, Addison.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.125
All right.
You ready to go home?

37:57.166 --> 37:59.333
Mm-hm.
VIOLET: Just you and me?

37:59.375 --> 38:01.291
Turns out I'm not going away
after all.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.041
( phone ringing )

38:03.083 --> 38:04.333
Uh-oh.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.250
Hello.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.959
Hey.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.417
Joanna, you're still here.

38:11.458 --> 38:15.000
No. No, no, no.
I really want to talk to you.

38:26.625 --> 38:28.166
Life is hard.

38:28.208 --> 38:29.625
( sobbing )

38:31.083 --> 38:34.917
It's hard and scary
and out of my control,

38:34.959 --> 38:36.583
and that part makes me
craziest--

38:36.625 --> 38:39.041
The fact that I cannot control
the world

38:39.083 --> 38:42.458
or what happens to the people
I love.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.542
You know,
and the idea of me

38:44.583 --> 38:48.375
having a kid, not being able
to control what happens...

38:50.750 --> 38:54.750
Yeah, but every day
I deliver a baby.

38:54.792 --> 38:58.709
And every day I see
that moment of change.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.417
You know,
that moment when every cell

39:00.458 --> 39:02.583
in a woman's body
is transformed.

39:02.625 --> 39:05.208
And whatever happens, whether
the baby is sick or healthy,

39:05.250 --> 39:08.792
happy or unhappy, lives or dies,
whatever happens

39:08.834 --> 39:10.333
( tender rock music playing )

39:10.375 --> 39:14.542
that woman will never be
just a woman again.

39:14.583 --> 39:18.041
She will always be a mother.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.208
She's transformed.

39:22.458 --> 39:27.625
And it's exhilarating
and terrifying and...

39:27.667 --> 39:29.250
I want that.

39:29.291 --> 39:31.000
( scoffs )

39:31.041 --> 39:32.834
I want it.

39:38.625 --> 39:40.792
Sam hasn't changed his mind,
though.

39:40.834 --> 39:43.417
As much as I want it,
he doesn't want it.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.250
But for today...

39:48.792 --> 39:51.375
For some reason, that's okay.

39:53.709 --> 39:57.667
Because I made an appointment
with a fertility specialist

39:57.709 --> 40:00.875
who is supposed to be amazing,
and...

40:02.458 --> 40:04.250
I went.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.750
( chuckles )

40:07.083 --> 40:08.834
There's just one thing
that's weird

40:08.875 --> 40:12.959
and potentially complicated.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.667
( sighs )

40:15.709 --> 40:18.667
People plan, and God laughs.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.083
JAKE: Hello.
Ahem.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.834
Hello.

40:29.959 --> 40:31.375
You?

40:33.500 --> 40:34.542
Well.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.542
Uh, this is a--
A nice surprise.

40:36.583 --> 40:37.834
( scoffs )

40:37.875 --> 40:40.750
I-- I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I-- I had no idea.

40:40.792 --> 40:42.417
Well,
it was your choice to skip

40:42.458 --> 40:44.041
the preliminary consultation
in my office.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.125
Everyone kept saying,
"fertility, Jake Reilly"

40:46.166 --> 40:48.875
like there was no other choice.
Well, that's flattering.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.834
But Jake Reilly is you?

40:50.875 --> 40:52.750
And you are...

40:53.583 --> 40:55.500
Addison Montgomery.

40:55.542 --> 40:58.709
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Addison, officially.

40:59.709 --> 41:02.750
Yeah. Um...

41:02.792 --> 41:07.166
I, uh... Shouldn't you be
in Fiji or something?

41:07.208 --> 41:10.709
Well, I-- I was on the plane.
I got paged.

41:10.750 --> 41:12.375
Turns out another
fertility genius

41:12.417 --> 41:16.083
had loaded up a patient with HCG
and nearly ruptured her ovaries.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.500
So I spent the night
in the hospital.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.500
I'm here to watch her
for the next few days.

41:19.542 --> 41:23.166
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

41:23.208 --> 41:25.458
Yeah, it would've been
a great trip,

41:25.500 --> 41:27.083
but, uh, you know,
sometimes you have

41:27.125 --> 41:29.000
more important things to do.

41:29.041 --> 41:31.041
I figured that was
the decision you made,

41:31.083 --> 41:33.458
and, uh, looks like I'm right.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.291
Oh, no, no. Me being here?

41:35.333 --> 41:37.834
No, this has nothing to do with
why I didn't get on the plane.

41:37.875 --> 41:38.917
Anyway, listen, the, uh,

41:38.959 --> 41:40.625
flirtation that we had,
that was fun.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.583
I enjoyed that
probably as much as you did,

41:42.625 --> 41:44.625
but, uh, I have no problem
leaving that in the past

41:44.667 --> 41:46.583
and simply taking care
of you as a patient--

41:46.625 --> 41:48.709
I don't think you understand.
Doesn't have to be awkward.

41:48.750 --> 41:51.792
I have a boyfriend.
Will we be using his sperm?

41:53.083 --> 41:56.041
No, we will not
be using his sperm.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.500
We won't be using
anyone's sperm.

41:57.542 --> 41:59.041
That's gonna make this hard.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.917
We are not gonna
be doing anything.

42:01.959 --> 42:03.542
All right. Just--
Just take a breath.

42:05.583 --> 42:09.125
It's okay.
Trust me, all right?

42:09.166 --> 42:10.834
I'm gonna give you a baby.

42:14.667 --> 42:16.625
So how do I deal with that?

42:25.083 --> 42:27.000
( mellow theme playing )
