00:04.372 --> 00:05.905

00:05.906 --> 00:07.439
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:10.309
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:13.045
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:16.584 --> 00:19.351
Please, Missus,
call the doctor.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.254
Cora, her temperature's down.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.288
She's not getting better.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.424
Waking her won't help.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.627
A doctor, an ambulance, 911--
you have to do something.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.229
You're being crazy.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.463
I want you to get your things.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.466
My husband
will send you a check.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.403

00:43.310 --> 00:46.512
Help, please! Help!

00:46.514 --> 00:50.482
Help! Help!

00:50.484 --> 00:53.118
Please, stop!

00:53.120 --> 00:55.354
What do you want,
honey?

00:55.356 --> 00:56.422
Mrs. Driscoll.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.823
Yes?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.591
I'm Officer Barton,
this is Officer Giordano.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.126
How are you doing?

01:01.128 --> 01:03.595
Your housekeeper says
you may have an emergency?

01:03.597 --> 01:06.298
Mrs. Amado
tends to overreact.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.299
Do you mind?

01:07.301 --> 01:08.434
Could we just come in

01:08.436 --> 01:09.535
and take a peek
at your daughter?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.370
That really isn't necessary.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.405
We'll just
be in and out.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.407
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.177
She's been
a little feverish.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.381
(<i> wheezing</i> )

01:22.383 --> 01:24.249
Lady, this kid can't breathe.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.684
2-7 Charlie
to Central K.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.653
Go ahead, Charlie.
DISPATCHER:

01:27.655 --> 01:29.488
Did you call it in?

01:29.490 --> 01:32.257
Policy is firm:
only the chief resident-- me--

01:32.259 --> 01:33.358
can call the cops on parents.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.427
Listen, is this kid
going to make it?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.629
Strep, fever 105 plus--

01:37.631 --> 01:40.265
what kind of parent doesn't know
that's life-threatening?

01:40.267 --> 01:41.633
So, on the record, the
hospital's going to make

01:41.635 --> 01:43.168
a formal child
abuse complaint?

01:43.170 --> 01:45.204
Yes, neglect.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.405
You can't do this.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.373
I want to take
my daughter home.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.342
Ms. Driscoll, this is
Dr. Fisher, the chief resident.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.810
She won't authorize
a trach.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.277
And if I don't sign
an authorization,

01:53.280 --> 01:54.863
you can't treat her.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.447
This is Sergeant Cerreta
and Detective Logan.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.900
More policemen?

01:57.901 --> 01:59.351
You're not leaving us
any choice.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.320
You seem
like a reasonable woman.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.188
You want to tell us
what the problem is?

02:03.190 --> 02:04.389
Your husband here
tonight, ma'am?

02:04.391 --> 02:06.558
No, he's in Boston
on business.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.694
Well, you know, you understand
if the hospital

02:08.696 --> 02:12.297
files a formal complaint,
you could find yourself in jail.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.633
You can't force me
to let you operate.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.335
Are you serious?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.369
These people are trying

02:17.371 --> 02:19.171
to save your daughter's life.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.473
Right now, I am more concerned
about her soul.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.475
Mrs. Driscoll,
let us help Dinah.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.543
You can't help her.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.712
We don't believe
in modern medicine.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.614
You don't believe in it?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.450
Our religion forbids it.

Excuse me, Miss.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.362
Step back.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.396
Get her intubated.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.631
1.8 milliliter epi.

1/1,000 solution
I.V. push now.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.568
Let's get a central
line in here.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.270
Who's the pharmacist?

02:51.272 --> 02:53.238
WOMAN:
Now, now!

02:53.240 --> 02:56.775
Let's go

02:56.777 --> 02:57.943
WOMAN:
Level off.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.379
MAN:
Take the mask off.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.749
Clear.
(<i> sharp thud</i> )

03:03.751 --> 03:06.385
Still no pulse.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.420
Clear.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.557
Clear.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.204
She wasn't that sick!

03:41.222 --> 03:44.323
She wasn't that sick.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.513
It's your call.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.847
CERRETA:
get her for can

05:15.849 --> 05:17.549
is endangering
the welfare of a child.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.818
No, no, what we get her for
is manslaughter.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.620
Whoa, Mike, slow down.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.222
We don't get her for anything

05:23.223 --> 05:24.823
you don't prove she knew
the kid was seriously ill.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.558
All right, the housekeeper--
what's her name--

05:26.560 --> 05:28.694
Amado, she knew damn well
the kid was sick enough

05:28.696 --> 05:30.162
to get two cops.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.629
Oh, that will put the parents
away for sure.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.532
She was fired;
she'll say anything.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.733
Getting fired--
you think that's a reason

05:34.735 --> 05:35.767
to lie about the kid?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.052
You believe this?

05:37.053 --> 05:38.336
Hey, what I think,
what you think,

05:38.339 --> 05:40.339
What he thinks don't
mean diddly-squat,

05:40.341 --> 05:41.540
because in court,

05:41.542 --> 05:42.574
she's not
a credible witness.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.742
Credible?!
The kid died!

05:43.744 --> 05:45.677
Well, well, what's this?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.613
Honeymoon over?

05:47.614 --> 05:49.548
When you're finished
debating her state of mind,

05:49.550 --> 05:52.151
why don't you go ask<i> her,</i>

05:52.152 --> 05:54.753
and see what you can find out
about this religion

05:54.755 --> 05:56.121
Church of All Saints.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.793
Beautiful child.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.128
You worked
for the Driscolls

06:03.130 --> 06:04.696
what, three months?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.665
Mm-hmm.
They loved that child.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.968
It was an aura,
it radiated from them.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.871
You never saw people
who loved a child so much.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.773
When did she get sick?

06:14.775 --> 06:15.941
AMADO:
Monday morning, when I come in,

06:15.943 --> 06:16.975
She already had a fever.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.910
Mrs. Driscoll,
she wasn't worried.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.413
She said
she was praying for her.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.415
But you were worried.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.085
My kids, they get sick,
I pray for their souls.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.087
Their bodies, I get a doctor.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.822
Oberon Guzman, I called him

06:30.824 --> 06:32.691
and told him
the fever keeps going up.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.826
Did you tell
Mrs. Driscoll that?

06:36.764 --> 06:41.133
And she told me that sometimes
kids just had to get sicker

06:41.135 --> 06:44.903
before the Lord
heard their prayers.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.640
You want me
to visit a sick child

06:48.642 --> 06:49.841
when the parent won't call?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.043
When the child's dying,
yes, I do.

06:52.045 --> 06:56.081
My malpractice insurance
is already 20 times my rent.

06:56.083 --> 07:00.852
I do not go to any child
against their parents' wishes.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.421
Did Mrs. Amado

07:02.423 --> 07:04.055
describe the girl's symptoms?

07:04.057 --> 07:07.726
Sore throat, high fever,
trouble breathing.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.127
A second-year
medical student

07:09.129 --> 07:11.930
could have made an educated
guess it was strep throat.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.698
Do you consider that major?

07:13.700 --> 07:14.866
Untreated?

07:14.868 --> 07:17.135
It could lead
to rheumatic fever,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.871
heart disease, death.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.006
So a parent
refusing treatment...

07:21.008 --> 07:22.107
Would have to be stupid,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.643
blind, or negligent.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.445
Or very religious.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.950
MINISTER:
<i> from the Swiss brethren</i>

07:31.952 --> 07:34.686
like the Amish
or the Hutterites.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.755
Except that
you don't use doctors.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.990
We've been around
for 300 years,

07:38.992 --> 07:40.692
long before modern medicine.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.194
Hold on.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.029
You use electricity,
central heating.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.698
You were around
long before them, too.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.468
Detective, do I really
have to defend

07:49.470 --> 07:51.736
my religious beliefs
to the police?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.941
Are you arresting Ted and Nancy?

07:55.943 --> 07:59.244
Have they been
in your church long?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.380
Many years.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.515
They were members when
we were out in Hanover,
New Jersey.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.883
They're devout people.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.719
The loss of their
daughter was terrible,

08:07.721 --> 08:10.222
but it is God's will.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.724
Most of us don't mind
a little help from antibiotics.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.926
But some of us do.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.545
Did the Driscolls

08:16.546 --> 08:18.163
talk to you
while Dinah was sick?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.798
Ted and Nancy never believed

08:19.800 --> 08:22.067
that their daughter
was sick enough to die.

08:22.069 --> 08:26.004
All you have to do
is talk to them to know that.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.940
Fanatics.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.242
It's not that simple.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.843
These people aren't Moonies.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.144
You go to confession,
take communion.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.213
They believe
just as strongly as you do.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.248
Come on, that's crap.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
How can you
compare these wackos...

08:37.951 --> 08:39.618
Wackos?
A lot of non-Catholics

08:39.619 --> 08:41.286
believe it's wacko
for priests not to marry.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.088
A lot of non-Fundamentalists

08:43.090 --> 08:45.957
believe it's wacko
to take the Bible literally.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.759
To the Driscolls,
losing this kid's soul

08:47.761 --> 08:49.728
is worse
than losing her life.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.463
Except we're
investigating

08:51.464 --> 08:53.197
the death of a little
girl, not a soul.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.268
The church
doesn't make exceptions.

08:56.270 --> 08:59.871
The rules are God's,
not ours.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.973
We don't
pollute our bodies.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.275
We don't smoke, we
don't use medicine

09:03.277 --> 09:04.809
and we don't use doctors.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.944
LOGAN:
So if you're having
a heart attack,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.846
you don't call an ambulance?

09:07.848 --> 09:10.248
Is that so difficult
for you to accept?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.983
CERRETA:
Excuse me, Mrs. Driscoll

09:11.985 --> 09:13.051
we have to ask.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.754
Did you consider
calling a doctor?

09:15.756 --> 09:18.223
We should have prayed harder.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.859
Maybe it's our fault.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.260
It's faith.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.862
That's what religion is.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.230
LOGAN:
You call that religion?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.065
Neglecting a dying child?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.868
Now, you see,
I call that irresponsible.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.236
Mike.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.571
Sorry.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.872
We're used to it.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.574
Is that all?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.108
There's just one thing.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.078
You were gone
Wednesday and Thursday?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.980
I had no choice.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.850
Look, we talked three
or four times a day.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.285
Dinah's fever was down.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.588
Nancy thought
she was better.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.823
Our prayers were working.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.225
At any time,
over the five or six days,

09:54.227 --> 09:55.860
did you get any help for Dinah?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.829
Of course we did.

09:57.831 --> 10:02.267
Sharon Barlow-- she's
a church medical practitioner.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.636
Do you have
any medical training?

10:04.638 --> 10:07.272
Any chemistry, biology,
first aid, anything?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.873
Church training.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.976
Spiritual healing.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.412
Mm-hmm.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.847
So, then, you're what--
a kind of nurse?

10:17.851 --> 10:21.920
You think I don't know
what's going on here, Detective?

10:21.922 --> 10:25.190
Your job
is to prosecute our church.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.860
If you believed what we believe,
you'd understand.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.096
We are trying to find out
what you believe.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.831
Help us out.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.001
We treat the sick with prayer.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.370
We tried everything

10:38.372 --> 10:39.938
to lower her fever.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.874
We prayed, cold baths.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.943
We fed her, we used
rubbing alcohol.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.646
When we ran out,
we called the drugstore

10:47.648 --> 10:48.913
for more.
Drugstore?

10:48.915 --> 10:49.848
Which one?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.083
(<i> scoffs</i> )

10:52.085 --> 10:54.919
I think I have the receipt.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.098
Tax deduction, huh?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.100
What did those people do?

11:09.102 --> 11:11.102
It was rubbing alcohol, man,
not speed.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.971
Hey, look, you remember
them or what?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.707
Oh, yeah, guy opens the door,
he's holding a kid

11:15.709 --> 11:17.142
two ladies,
they're picking at each other.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.977
All right, so what
did they look like?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.179
This old lady,
she's telling the mom

11:21.181 --> 11:22.313
"Pray harder,
the kid will get better"

11:22.315 --> 11:24.949
"believe in God"--
that kind of stuff.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.051
Start again.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.952
Praying
or fighting?

11:27.954 --> 11:29.988
Fighting, man, fighting

11:29.990 --> 11:31.956
The father tells them
to keep it down,

11:31.958 --> 11:34.893
gives the kid to the old lady,
and he pays me.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.094
But you kept
listening, right?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.296
I couldn't help it;
the elevator was busted,

11:38.298 --> 11:39.998
so I had to take the stairs.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.033
Now, the apartment door's
still open.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.137
Then, the woman,
the young one, she jets by me.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.009
MAN:
87 Apartments.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.011
You think I see everybody
who comes and goes?

11:53.013 --> 11:56.081
CERRETA:
How long you been
on this door, Mike?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.166
31 Years.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.250
You know what time every man,
woman, and child in here pees.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.022
Thursday, 10:00,
Mrs. Driscoll.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.925
She ran by crying,
face all puffy.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.493
Look, their kid's dead.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.028
They don't need
more trouble.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.996
Did you see
which way she went?

12:11.998 --> 12:14.299
(<i> sighs</i> )
Coffee shop
on the corner.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.735
5'6", brunette.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.204
Which one of the four
million you have in mind?

12:19.206 --> 12:20.739
She might
have been crying.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.373
The food here,
no wonder.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.374
Elaine!

12:23.376 --> 12:24.509
Tuesday night,
10:00.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.245
You see a brunette
in here crying?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.780
What did she do?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.432
Did you wait on her?

12:30.433 --> 12:32.083
I tried to get her
to eat something,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.384
stop crying.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.254
No sale.
Only coffee-- three cups,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.123
spiked with bourbon.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.729
Mm-hmm. Freedom of religion,

12:44.730 --> 12:46.263
that gives you the right
to commit homicide?

12:46.266 --> 12:49.200
The penal law allows
a single affirmative defense

12:49.202 --> 12:50.802
to endangering
the welfare of a child--

12:50.804 --> 12:52.937
spiritual healing
by an organized religion.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.806
<i> That's</i>
in the law?

12:54.808 --> 12:57.108
In '73, Congress passed
a child abuse bill,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.444
$85 million to the states.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.213
ATW regulations said any state

13:02.215 --> 13:04.516
without a spiritual healing
exemption didn't get money.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.918
This is unbelievable.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.253
In New York?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.221
And 43 other states.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.823
But the law says endangering.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.358
These people let the kid die.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.226
To convict on manslaughter?

13:15.228 --> 13:16.494
A couple of steps.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.797
First, convince the jury
not to apply

13:18.799 --> 13:20.465
the spiritual healing defense
to homicide.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.168
Convince them? Hell, the judge
will just tell them not to.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.536
You know juries.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.838
They'll do
whatever they think is right.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.508
Next, prove the parents didn't
believe prayer would work.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.976
Forget that.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.444
No matter what we think
of their religion,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.213
it's obvious
they believed in it,

13:35.215 --> 13:36.915
and they believed their kid
wasn't sick enough to die.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.917
If we could prove it

13:38.919 --> 13:40.251
then we could prove
the manslaughter--

13:40.253 --> 13:42.520
show they recklessly caused
a death.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.989
Great, so we got to show
they didn't believe in prayer

13:44.991 --> 13:46.825
<i> and</i> they knew
the kid could die?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.393
Looks like mom believed
in bourbon

13:48.395 --> 13:50.228
more than she did prayer.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.529
I thought they didn't drink.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.365
People like this,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.200
they start wondering wonder if
prayer is going to do the trick.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.885
What happens?

13:56.886 --> 13:58.569
I'll be you they're not
the only ones ever called God

13:58.572 --> 14:00.872
and got his answering machine.

14:00.874 --> 14:04.943
If she was upset enough
to break church law on drinking,

14:04.945 --> 14:08.513
maybe she had doubts
about spiritual healing.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.582
Well, how are we going
to prove that--

14:10.584 --> 14:12.283
subpoena her mind?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.519
Maybe she talked to some
of the other church members.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.554
LOGAN:
So maybe we do get
a subpoena...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.923
for the church membership list.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.392
"Your Honor,
forget the first amendment.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.228
We want a subpoena."

14:23.230 --> 14:26.397
I wouldn't bet the ranch
on that one.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.233
You don't get some information
on these people--

14:28.235 --> 14:30.001
how religious they are,
what goes on in that church--

14:30.003 --> 14:32.303
you don't have a case.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.572
What did that minister say?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.040
They had all been
out in New Jersey?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.242
Hanover.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.244
Let's go check out that town.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.315
If they had any doubts
about prayer working,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.584
they're guilty.
Yeah, I know,
I know.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.519
It's easy for you and
Robinette and Cragen.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.054
What the hell
does that mean?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.522
You don't have kids.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.959
Look, the adult world is
divided into two groups:

14:54.961 --> 14:57.061
the ones who have kids
and the ones who don't.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.930
You can't understand
what a parent feels,

14:58.932 --> 15:01.266
and I will guarantee
you one thing:

15:01.268 --> 15:03.368
they loved that kid.
And if...

15:03.370 --> 15:05.336
And if they had any
doubts prayer working,

15:05.338 --> 15:09.040
and we can prove it,
I'll be the first guy
out with my cuffs.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.509
Personally?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.245
I don't trust a man
who never drinks.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.647
These All Saints
people--

15:15.649 --> 15:17.382
must have been
40, 50 of them--

15:17.384 --> 15:18.917
they were
good neighbors.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.618
They all moved out,
right?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.620
Everyone knew they
weren't going to stay.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.555
When they came,
they didn't buy houses,

15:24.557 --> 15:26.257
they only rented.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.958
They used an old farmhouse
as a church.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.361
Work? Commuting--
the city, Newark, Princeton.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.664
Tells you
they're not putting down roots.

15:32.666 --> 15:33.965
Listen.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.099
Driscoll-- husband and wife.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.367
Ring any bells?

15:36.369 --> 15:40.071
Nah, but I'm brain dead.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.039
Boredom.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.341
CERRETA:
Chief?

15:43.343 --> 15:44.676
You got a newspaper
in this town?

15:44.678 --> 15:46.644
Yeah,<i> Hanover Union,</i>
the county weekly.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.012
It's right down the street.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.047
City cops.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.115
It will make their month.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.121
Mabel Gardner, 96,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.057
found dead
in her living room.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.527
Body wasn't discovered
for three days.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.529
Milkman did it.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.098
Makes you want to move,
doesn't it?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.533
Anymore of this,

16:08.535 --> 16:11.469
and<i> I'm</i> going
to be brain dead.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.673
"Baby Died at Home."

16:15.675 --> 16:18.409
Daniel Driscoll, six years ago.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.411
Two years old.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.697
The Driscolls
wanted a headstone.

16:22.698 --> 16:24.982
We have a park-type cemetery--
plaques level with the grass.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.752
It's a neater look,
easier maintenance.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.753
It says here

16:28.755 --> 16:30.688
the boy died
of influenza.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.123
Anybody do an autopsy?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.758
Nobody thought anything
was wrong.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
Mm-hmm. Died at home.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.162
Says the boy is survived
by an aunt.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.165
Eleanor Harding-- she owns
a stationery store in town.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.701
I thought everybody from
the church moved into the city?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.104
Everybody except Eleanor.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.739
Never showing doubt.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.441
(<i> scoffs</i> )
Never showing fear.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.043
God's will is supreme,

16:52.045 --> 16:55.613
and if you don't believe
that, you're a sinner.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.714
Another life.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.782
It's behind me.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.717
But there must be reasons

16:59.719 --> 17:01.486
why you didn't move
with your brother.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.790
Okay, I'll give you one.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.760
Um... seven, eight years ago

17:08.762 --> 17:11.529
I flew with Ted and Nancy
up to Albany

17:11.531 --> 17:12.764
for a church meeting.

17:12.766 --> 17:16.667
We hit a thunderstorm,
got struck by lightning.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.736
The plane dropped 10,000 feet.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.771
I was terrified.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.806
I thought we were all dead,

17:21.808 --> 17:25.076
And Ted says,
"We're all in God's hands."

17:25.078 --> 17:27.111
And that made you stay here?

17:27.113 --> 17:30.615
Well, between you and me,
I trusted the pilot over God.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.385
When Daniel died,
I joined a group.

17:34.387 --> 17:39.390
We lobbied to have the spiritual
healing laws repealed.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.060
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Doesn't make for family picnics.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.595
Did you know Dinah was sick?

17:44.597 --> 17:45.797
I called Nancy.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.166
I pleaded with her
to go to a doctor.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.468
You didn't call your brother?

17:52.672 --> 17:58.509
When that plane was vibrating,
Nancy was scared witless, too.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.450
Are you suggesting
we neglected Daniel?!

18:05.452 --> 18:07.785
Having two children die
is a terrible tragedy.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.087
It's also
terribly long odds.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.189
Odds? God
doesn't gamble.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.125
What about this fight
you and your wife had?

18:14.127 --> 18:16.194
Our religion asks for
spiritual progress,

18:16.196 --> 18:17.529
not perfection.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.863
Would you mind telling us
what it was about?

18:18.865 --> 18:21.165
Did your wife
want medical help?

18:21.167 --> 18:24.168
Whatever my wife wanted,
I don't have to tell you.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.603
That's the law.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.238
The law also says
parents are responsible

18:27.240 --> 18:29.107
for their children's welfare.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.209
CERRETA:
I've got five.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.846
I couldn't sit by
and watch one of my them die.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.683
If you have anything more
you want to ask me,

18:38.685 --> 18:41.486
get a subpoena.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.157
Ted and I had
a<i> mild</i> disagreement.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.291
LOGAN:
About Dinah?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.260
Do you have children?

18:51.598 --> 18:54.765
A sick child
can make you anxious.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.736
Anxious enough
to take three drinks?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.671
CERRETA:
I thought your church

19:00.673 --> 19:02.673
didn't allow drinking,
Mrs. Driscoll?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.477
I'm fallible.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.845
God isn't.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.147
Did you want

19:09.149 --> 19:10.581
to call a doctor?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.849
Did your husband
stop you from that?

19:11.851 --> 19:16.888
(<i> phone rings</i> )

19:20.860 --> 19:23.761
Hello?

19:23.763 --> 19:26.564
Yes, they're here.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.769
I will.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.838
I'll see you later.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.275
My husband says

19:37.277 --> 19:39.844
that if you have
any more questions,

19:39.846 --> 19:43.214
he wants you to call
the Reverend Henry Morley.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.715
Spiritual advice?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.617
No, legal.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.287
He'll give you the name
of our lawyer.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.224
Go to the DA?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.225
With what?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.927
We've still got nothing.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.762
She had a couple of drinks.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.297
Her sister-in-law thought
she had enough doubts

19:59.299 --> 20:01.599
to pressure her.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.900
Drinks, the sister-in law
thinking that she maybe
might have had doubts--

20:03.903 --> 20:06.337
that's going to convince a jury?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.306
Suppose she called
a doctor?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.874
Suppose she did?

20:09.876 --> 20:12.810
There can't be more than
4,000 or 5,000 in the city.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.945
What do you think?

20:13.947 --> 20:14.946
We start with "A"
and go forwards

20:14.948 --> 20:16.814
or "Z" and
work backwards?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.883
These people
don't have doctors.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.651
Who would they
even know to call?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.820
Well, how about 911?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.889
Computer printouts
of every call?

20:24.891 --> 20:28.559
They promised two years ago
and last year and this year,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.661
and now they promise
next year.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.263
We'll listen
to the tapes.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.898
What's the matter--
you fellows can't read?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.932
Check your logs
at the precinct.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.268
There's nothing
in the logs.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.304
2,000 calls a night.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.872
At least
they're short.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.977
CERRETA:
Grandma fell down
a flight of stairs.

20:48.948 --> 20:53.284
Daddy's beating up mommy.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.419
Auto accident.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.425
Boiler explosion.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.263
Want to move to a small town
in Jersey?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.898
They got a nice
police chief there.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.800
Nancy Driscoll?

21:11.838 --> 21:12.970
Ted.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.678
ROBINETTE:
What about a jury's
common sense?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.280
We can't indict him
and not her.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.881
The mother
may be morally guilty,

21:23.883 --> 21:25.383
but legally
she's got a good case.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.817
She seemed to trust
in God.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.402
Paul, I'm not
Saint Augustine.

21:28.403 --> 21:29.986
I can't make arguments to
a jury about the number

21:29.989 --> 21:31.622
of angels on the
head of a pin.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.890
But the moral issue's
in the law.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.692
She keeps her faith,
doesn't call a doctor.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.926
Under the law,
she looks innocent.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.295
Maybe she didn't
keep her faith.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.863
She ran from the
apartment, she drank.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.997
Maybe her crisis
of faith

21:39.999 --> 21:41.766
drove the husband
into one of his own.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.933
If he'd finished
the 911 call,

21:42.935 --> 21:44.702
the girl might be alive.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.671
Would be. Strep is
extremely treatable.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.306
It won't be easy
getting a conviction

21:48.308 --> 21:49.740
on either one of them.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.944
Rabbis, priests,
ministers--

21:53.946 --> 21:55.379
I'm debating theology

21:55.381 --> 21:56.947
with half the clergy
in the city.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.716
Tell them
the case isn't about theology.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.851
Tell them
it isn't about politics, either.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.920
Driscolls seem
like decent people.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.855
I sympathize with them.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.924
Because they're decent,

22:06.925 --> 22:08.992
it looks like
we're putting religion on trial.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.828
The spiritual healing law
shouldn't even be on the books.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.397
Oh, that's beautiful.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.733
Suddenly, we find ourselves
in Utopia.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.868
Politics is part
of the law, my friend.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.037
You need reminding,
spend a day in Albany.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.006
Does this mean we don't want
to indict?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.441
Think we have a choice?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.875
Do you?

22:24.877 --> 22:27.845
The mother drinking--
a case of impaired judgment.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.081
The father,
he started to make the call.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.016
If we walk away
from it now,

22:32.017 --> 22:33.950
looks like we never should have
investigated in the first place.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.389
Let's go with manslaughter two

22:38.391 --> 22:40.791
and endangering
the welfare of a child.

22:40.793 --> 22:41.959
With a lesser charge,

22:41.961 --> 22:43.828
we'll never convict
on manslaughter.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.862
What's better--

22:44.864 --> 22:46.030
half a win or none?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.799
Yeah, but the logic doesn't
play.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.035
If they endangered the child
enough for her to die,

22:51.037 --> 22:52.770
they're guilty of manslaughter.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.505
Illinois, Massachusetts,
Florida-- there isn't a DA

22:54.507 --> 22:56.774
that hasn't reached
the same conclusion.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.143
Leave both charges,
and do us all a favor.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.945
Take a plea.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.380
Man two.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.448
Lifetime probation.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.917
No jail time.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.953
BAILIFF:
Indictment number 6432:

23:08.955 --> 23:11.922
the<i> People v. Theodore Driscoll</i>
<i> and Nancy Driscoll.</i>

23:11.924 --> 23:14.925
The charges are manslaughter
in the second degree

23:14.927 --> 23:16.927
and endangering
the welfare of a child.

23:16.929 --> 23:21.699
JUDGE:
Are the defendants
ready to plead?

23:21.701 --> 23:22.933
BOTH:
Not guilty.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.836
I'll let you know up front,
Mr. Robinette,

23:25.838 --> 23:28.072
I don't see
a big bail number here.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.108
One of the charges, Your Honor,
is manslaughter.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.010
Yes, I know the seriousness
of the crime,

23:33.012 --> 23:34.812
but I'm looking
at the other factors.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.046
Mr. Carpenter.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.082
Your Honor, we ask
the defendants release

23:38.084 --> 23:39.950
on their own recognizance.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.953
Counselor, you know
I can't do that, either.

23:42.955 --> 23:47.158
Bail is set for each defendant
at $25,000.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.062
The tenants of their church
<i> vis-à-vis</i> doctors

23:52.064 --> 23:53.831
are well known.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.066
The Driscolls
have been members for years.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.103
Then why did your client
phone 911?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.438
One moment of weakness.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.439
You're a Catholic.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.740
Do you ever sin?

24:02.742 --> 24:03.874
That's sophistry, Lucius.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.976
I'm not here as a Catholic.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.412
I'm here as a lawyer.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.847
You're prosecuting Ted Driscoll
for making a phone call.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.917
I'm prosecuting Mr.
and Mrs. Driscoll

24:12.918 --> 24:14.985
for recklessly causing the death
of their child after he violated

24:14.987 --> 24:16.971
his church's teaching.

24:16.972 --> 24:18.956
A child who was born
into their faith.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.025
They want to martyr themselves
to religion, fine,

24:21.027 --> 24:23.461
but they don't have a right
to martyr their child!

24:23.463 --> 24:26.530
Convicting them of manslaughter
won't bring Dinah back.

24:26.532 --> 24:31.135
I want sick children to have
a chance at medical care.

24:31.137 --> 24:35.072
I'd expect
this kind of prosecution

24:35.074 --> 24:37.074
in Arizona, California,

24:37.076 --> 24:40.144
not in the most tolerant state
in the country.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.880
Well, I wouldn't try that
tolerance argument in court

24:42.882 --> 24:44.081
if I were you.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.053
Just once, for a lark,

24:49.055 --> 24:51.555
could you bring me in
on an easy case?

24:51.557 --> 24:54.124
I don't need a psychiatrist
with the easy ones, Susan.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.860
You know what kind
of jury we want?

24:55.862 --> 24:57.194
We want 12 people
with children,

24:57.196 --> 24:59.129
preferably all of whom
have strep throat.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.599
Carpenter's shrink?
Seymour Golden.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.933
Who's Seymour Golden?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.602
He gets $2,000 a day.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.971
Compared to him,
I'm a bargain.

25:09.809 --> 25:13.077
STONE:
<i> in the papers, Mr. Madison?</i>

25:13.079 --> 25:15.045
Didn't see it.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.514
Heard about it
on television?

25:16.516 --> 25:18.549
Like I say,
I didn't follow it.

25:18.551 --> 25:21.085
Do you have any strong
religious beliefs?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.253
I'm a Baptist.

25:22.255 --> 25:23.621
I believe in God.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.922
Thank you.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.044
Baptist.

25:30.045 --> 25:32.095
You think he'll sympathize
with fundamentalists?

25:32.098 --> 25:33.531
He worries me.

25:33.533 --> 25:34.665
Makes me nervous.

25:36.936 --> 25:40.070
I think he knows the difference
between church and state.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.972
Keep him.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.543
Guys, trust me.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.610
No challenge.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.112
No challenge.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.182
I have two girls, six and ten.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.118
Do you believe
parents have the right

25:54.119 --> 25:56.053
to care for children according
to their own customs?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.922
I do.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.223
Knowing what you do
about this case,

25:59.225 --> 26:02.059
do you think you can
be impartial?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.194
I love my children
so much,

26:04.196 --> 26:06.196
I can't imagine
parents who don't.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.233
In fact, I'm pregnant
with our third child right now.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.634
Thank you.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.104
She practically
announced

26:14.106 --> 26:16.073
she identifies
with Mrs. Driscoll.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.943
I know, but I don't think
she's going to like them

26:18.945 --> 26:21.178
watching that girl's fever
go up.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.880
ROBINETTE:
A pregnant mother,

26:22.882 --> 26:25.616
she'll carry
a lot of weight
in the jury room.

26:25.618 --> 26:28.252
My research shows that
she's going to go with the child

26:28.254 --> 26:30.087
and not the mother.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.289
No challenge.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.358
No challenge.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.127
I think the government ought
to keep its nose out of my life.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.662
STONE:
Mr. Nicholas,

26:38.663 --> 26:40.196
if it were contrary
to your own beliefs,

26:40.199 --> 26:41.932
would you be able
to accept

26:41.934 --> 26:43.934
the judges instruction
on the law?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.536
I understand
the difference

26:45.537 --> 26:47.137
between my point of
view and the law.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.707
I'll do what's right.

26:49.709 --> 26:52.076
Thank you.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.012
He's got four kids.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.380
He hates authority.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.349
It's bad for us.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.391
Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.726
Four kids?

27:08.728 --> 27:11.028
What's your problem
with him?

27:11.030 --> 27:12.096
It's peremptory,
Lucius.

27:12.098 --> 27:15.099
I don't need a reason.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.706
The tragedy of this case

27:22.708 --> 27:26.110
is the death of Dinah Driscoll,
five years old.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.112
The greater tragedy

27:28.114 --> 27:30.414
is that her death
could have been prevented.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.116
The State will prove

27:32.118 --> 27:37.187
that Dinah Driscoll was ill
and in need of medical care.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.189
We will also prove
that the defendants

27:39.191 --> 27:42.426
denied her that care

27:42.428 --> 27:45.195
and knew its absence
would lead to her death.

27:45.197 --> 27:49.266
During this trial, you will hear
a great deal about religion.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.136
Nobody's religious beliefs
are on trial.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.773
What is on trial
is Dinah Driscoll's death.

27:55.775 --> 28:00.344
Did the defendants
violate their parental duty?

28:00.346 --> 28:06.417
Did they recklessly lead
Dinah Driscoll to her death?

28:06.419 --> 28:09.353
Dr. Stanbeck, please tell
the court your profession

28:09.355 --> 28:10.721
and current position.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.723
By training
I'm an oncologist--

28:12.725 --> 28:14.725
that's a cancer specialist--

28:14.727 --> 28:16.727
and I'm the chairman

28:16.729 --> 28:19.997
of the New York Council
on Medical Ethics.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.099
Have you written works
on the history of medicine?

28:22.101 --> 28:25.202
Yes, I'm the author
of two books on the subject--

28:25.204 --> 28:28.238
<i> The Healer's Craft</i>
and<i> Life Before Death.</i>

28:28.240 --> 28:31.141
Please tell the court about
the place of spiritual healing

28:31.143 --> 28:33.077
in the history of medicine.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.045
Well, prior to the 20th century,

28:35.047 --> 28:38.115
people were often desperate
for any relief from pain,

28:38.117 --> 28:41.185
and for thousands of years,
naturally, people prayed.

28:41.187 --> 28:44.354
In your expert opinion,
does prayer cure disease?

28:44.356 --> 28:45.389
Objection.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.858
He's not an expert on prayer.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.728
But he is an expert on disease.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.029
Overruled.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.197
The witness may answer.

28:53.199 --> 28:57.768
A virus can't hear a prayer

28:57.770 --> 29:00.337
any more than viruses
respond to leeches.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.206
For thousands of years,

29:02.208 --> 29:05.109
bacteria and viruses
killed people.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.212
Then we developed
sulfa drugs and antibiotics,

29:08.214 --> 29:10.781
and people lived.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.884
STONE:
Thank you.

29:13.886 --> 29:17.187
I'd say she had to be infected
for at least a week.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.257
What did you tell the defendant,
Nancy Driscoll?

29:20.259 --> 29:23.260
I said if we didn't clear
Dinah's lungs

29:23.262 --> 29:26.263
and get her temperature down,
she would die.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.299
And how did
Mrs. Driscoll respond?

29:29.301 --> 29:33.537
She refused permission
for us to treat her child.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.372
Thank you.

29:38.177 --> 29:42.179
Dr. Baumann, how long have
you been practicing medicine?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.280
Three years.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.483
Have you seen many
strep infections?

29:46.485 --> 29:50.187
Emergency room--
you don't see them very often...

29:50.189 --> 29:52.923
So you're not an expert
in strep?

29:52.925 --> 29:55.192
Please, I'm a doctor.
Really?

29:55.194 --> 29:57.327
Are you a doctor who can swear

29:57.329 --> 29:59.930
Dinah had been infected
for a week?

29:59.932 --> 30:03.300
In medicine nothing is certain,
but I know...

30:03.302 --> 30:04.568
Thank you.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.903
No further questions.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.307
What did Mrs. Driscoll say

30:10.309 --> 30:12.209
when you suggested
she get a doctor?

30:12.211 --> 30:14.278
She told me Dinah
was in God's hands.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.815
Tell the court why you left
the Church of All Saints?

30:17.817 --> 30:19.216
Objection.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.218
Relevance.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.303
Your Honor, her experience

30:22.304 --> 30:23.387
with the church's doctrine
is relevant.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.356
Overruled.
I'll allow it.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.192
Witness may answer.

30:28.194 --> 30:31.895
I left the church,
because I'd seen children die.

30:31.897 --> 30:32.930
Thank you.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.298
No more questions.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.971
You were raised
in the Church of All Saints,

30:40.973 --> 30:42.172
correct?

30:42.174 --> 30:43.307
Yes.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.509
And before you left
the church,

30:45.511 --> 30:48.345
did you believe
in its doctrines?

30:49.315 --> 30:51.248
Isn't it true

30:51.250 --> 30:53.984
that four years
before you left the church,

30:53.986 --> 30:56.854
you became ill
and took antibiotics,

30:56.856 --> 30:59.857
because you believed
they would save your life?

30:59.859 --> 31:01.258
Yes, that's true.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.461
Prayer clearly wasn't working.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.631
So the real reason you left

31:07.633 --> 31:11.635
is because you didn't accept
the church's doctrines

31:11.637 --> 31:13.437
for yourself.

31:13.439 --> 31:18.275
Isn't that right?

31:18.277 --> 31:20.477
No further questions.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.279
It's a winnable case.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.281
Yeah, listen Carpenter
is ready to deal.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.283
Take a plea
while you can.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.318
Only if they agree
never to participate

31:28.320 --> 31:30.020
in the spiritual healing
of a kid again.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.255
Does it matter?

31:31.257 --> 31:32.189
They don't have
any children.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.423
I don't care, Adam.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.192
I don't want them
convincing other parents

31:35.194 --> 31:36.260
to let their children die.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.427
All right, but
don't push it.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.428
Forget man two.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.430
Settle
for endangering.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.534
You're asking them
to turn against
their church.

31:44.536 --> 31:45.903
We're offering a plea

31:45.905 --> 31:47.671
where they walk away
from manslaughter.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.274
At the expense
of their religious beliefs.

31:52.645 --> 31:55.429
Endangering
the welfare of a child.

31:55.430 --> 31:58.214
However, in this plea bargain,
you agree never to participate

31:58.217 --> 32:01.251
in the spiritual healing
of another child.

32:03.656 --> 32:08.525
You can imprison my body
but not my soul.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.629
You know, when I was growing up,
my parents told me

32:12.631 --> 32:15.432
about the separation
of church and state.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.602
How proud they were
of their country.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.071
Do you live in the same country
I do, Mr. Stone?

32:21.073 --> 32:24.041
Please, reconsider.

32:39.525 --> 32:43.060
They've made their decision.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.963
And I've made up my mind.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.298
I'll see you in court.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.073
I heal with prayer.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.341
It didn't heal Dinah.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.675
Her fever went down.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.077
And she died.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.144
Did you ever go to a doctor?

33:01.146 --> 33:02.412
No.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.081
Do you wear glasses.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.149
I saw an optometrist.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.418
Eyeglasses aren't cures
for disease.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.487
They're aids to living.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.539
So you believe
that poor eyesight

33:12.540 --> 33:14.590
isn't a part of God's will,
but letting a five-year-old die

33:14.593 --> 33:16.560
from something
that can be cured like that is.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.061
Your Honor,

33:18.063 --> 33:20.180
I move for a mistrial.

33:20.181 --> 33:22.298
This questioning on religion
is impermissible.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.433
Approach.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.070
Your Honor,
we're within the limits.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.171
Maybe.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.240
I want this thing
settled quickly.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.275
You'll have motions
in my chambers

33:32.277 --> 33:34.277
tomorrow morning at 10:00,

33:34.279 --> 33:36.279
and we'll discuss
them at 1:00.

33:36.281 --> 33:37.714
And hold down
the verbiage, okay?

33:37.716 --> 33:42.552
You give me a hundred pages,
I'll be very upset.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.589
Court's adjourned.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.557
Did I misread this?

33:47.559 --> 33:50.660
Well, if you did,
I misread it the same way.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.162
<i> U.S. V. Ballard.</i>

33:52.164 --> 33:53.497
The Supreme Court says

33:53.499 --> 33:55.465
"The truth of their
religious beliefs

33:55.467 --> 33:58.301
should not be submitted
to the jury."

33:58.303 --> 34:02.105
I didn't ask Sharon Barlow
whether her beliefs were true,

34:02.107 --> 34:04.391
did I?

34:04.392 --> 34:06.676
No, but you did disparage them
with your attitude.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.480
My attitude's not
in the transcript.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.116
SCHIFF:
Gentlemen.

34:13.118 --> 34:16.486
We're in the clear?

34:16.488 --> 34:19.356
Carpenter's scared.
He knows where your case ends.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.625
If we ever get there.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.361
If we do,
we're going to lose on Nancy.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.595
Could go the other way.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.731
The father may
feel sorry for her

34:27.733 --> 34:31.701
and the mother,
religion or not

34:31.703 --> 34:34.604
she told the doctors
not to operate

34:34.606 --> 34:37.607
and she had those drinks.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.509
Oh, by the way,
Judge Kurland--

34:39.511 --> 34:41.511
thinks he's William O. Douglas.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.313
Make your motion simple.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.783
He'll never understand it.

34:46.785 --> 34:50.153
This is a fine line,
Mr. Carpenter.

34:50.155 --> 34:52.155
And Mr. Stone crossed it.

34:52.157 --> 34:57.561
The spiritual healing defense
does not give you the right

34:57.563 --> 34:59.729
to dissect her beliefs.

34:59.731 --> 35:02.265
That's an interesting
approach, Counselor.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.535
You want your clients acquitted
on the basis of their belief

35:05.537 --> 35:07.621
in spiritual healing,

35:07.622 --> 35:09.706
but you don't want that healing
discussed in court.

35:09.708 --> 35:13.210
He can ask whether
she believes in God's power.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.712
He cannot imply
her beliefs are stupid.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.747
Your clients aren't on
trial for their beliefs.

35:17.749 --> 35:18.782
They're on trial
for their actions.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.284
Their beliefs are action.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.753
KURLAND:
Oh, Counselor,

35:23.755 --> 35:26.490
I'm afraid that's nonsense,
and you know it.

35:26.492 --> 35:30.227
No, the law allows testimony
on the relevance of faith.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.229
The jury hasn't been asked

35:32.231 --> 35:34.564
to judge the truth
of that faith.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.566
Motion for mistrial denied.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.568
We'll resume at 2:00.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.571
On that night, the night
before their daughter died,

35:41.573 --> 35:44.441
did the Driscolls argue
about treating her?

35:46.812 --> 35:49.746
Nancy said that God
had taken one child from her.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.215
She didn't think
she could bear it

35:52.217 --> 35:53.483
if he took another.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.619
And how did Mr. Driscoll
respond?

35:55.621 --> 35:57.420
I'm not sure.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.223
They asked me
to leave Dinah's room.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.225
She... Mrs. Driscoll
was upset.

36:02.227 --> 36:06.229
After a few minutes, she came
out, and he followed her.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.631
And then what happened?

36:07.633 --> 36:08.798
They were shouting.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.767
Then, the drugstore delivery
arrived.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.736
Nancy left the apartment.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.805
Did Mr. Driscoll return
to the child's room?

36:15.807 --> 36:17.607
Not right away;
he went into the kitchen.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.342
How long was he gone?

36:19.344 --> 36:20.744
I don't remember.

36:20.746 --> 36:25.482
We offer into evidence
People's exhibit number 14--

36:25.484 --> 36:27.751
an emergency medical services
tape recording

36:27.753 --> 36:30.754
on the Tuesday night
in question

36:30.756 --> 36:33.757
and also an affidavit swearing

36:33.759 --> 36:36.793
that that is a copy
of the EMS master.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.629
And we request permission
to play the tape.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.764
Granted.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.566
Thank you.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.805
Yes, hello?
MAN:

36:48.807 --> 36:49.773
911 Emergency.
OPERATOR:

36:49.775 --> 36:50.774
It's my daughter.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.643
What's wrong with her?
Please!

36:53.645 --> 36:55.478
What's the problem,
sir?
She's terribly sick.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.846
Sir? Hello?

36:56.848 --> 36:58.715
with fever.
She's burning up

36:58.717 --> 37:01.785
Is it going down?
No, it's not
going down!

37:01.787 --> 37:04.154
what I need you to do.
All right, this is

37:04.155 --> 37:06.522
Sir, you've got to stay
on the line.
(<i> background commotion</i> )

37:06.525 --> 37:07.757
Sir, are you there?

37:07.759 --> 37:09.893
(<i> dial tone</i> )

37:09.895 --> 37:12.796
Do you recognize the voice
on that tape?

37:12.798 --> 37:15.932
Sounds like Ted Driscoll.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.469
Thank you.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.608
Ms. Barlow,
there are background voices

37:24.610 --> 37:27.611
and a great deal of static
on that tape.

37:27.613 --> 37:30.513
Are you certain
that's Ted Driscoll's voice?

37:30.515 --> 37:31.781
No.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.751
As I said,
it sounds<i> like</i> Ted's voice.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.423
If Mrs. Driscoll was there
when he called 911...

37:40.425 --> 37:42.392
Makes your case stronger
for both of them.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.527
Two parents--
joint decision.

37:44.529 --> 37:45.895
The housekeeper, Paul--

37:45.897 --> 37:48.531
she hasn't been in court,
has she?

37:48.533 --> 37:50.567
And not talking
to reporters.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.602
Go see her tonight.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.173
My friends,

37:56.174 --> 37:58.742
they want me to make trouble
for the Driscolls.

38:03.382 --> 38:06.883
Was Mrs. Driscoll there
when Mr. Driscoll made the call?

38:08.553 --> 38:10.754
I don't hate them.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.857
There's something you haven't
told us, isn't there?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.895
They have so much pain already.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.897
It was Dinah.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.832
She wanted a doctor.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.768
The child asked for a doctor?

38:24.770 --> 38:28.805
That night,
when the other lady was there,

38:28.807 --> 38:30.840
I was in Dinah's room.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.610
Dinah says she feels
so very sick.

38:33.612 --> 38:37.547
Her friend Susie's mom gets her
a doctor when she's sick.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.816
"Why can't I get a doctor?"

38:39.818 --> 38:43.653
Mrs. Driscoll told her,
"We don't believe in doctors."

38:49.828 --> 38:51.895
She's a tainted witness.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.899
It is grossly prejudicial,
not to mention it's hearsay.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.834
Two exceptions,
Your Honor.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.836
If he says
dying declaration

38:59.838 --> 39:01.838
by the victim
of a homicide...

39:01.840 --> 39:02.972
Calm down,
Counselor.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.775
He hasn't said
anything yet. Ben?

39:05.777 --> 39:07.777
Opinion testimony
by a lay witness

39:07.779 --> 39:09.779
on the emotional state
of Dinah Driscoll.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.014
Emotional state?

39:11.016 --> 39:13.450
You want her to testify
to what the child said.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.752
Anyway, that's no exception
to hearsay.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.921
Effect of a verbal act
on the parents.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.940
Statement not offered
for its truth.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.958
You do want the jury to believe
it's the truth?!

39:21.960 --> 39:24.861
No shouting in my chambers.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.464
I don't like it, Ben.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.965
The child obviously
can't testify,

39:28.967 --> 39:31.968
and let's face it,
it is prejudicial.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.471
The witness is not trustworthy.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.439
Not in my courtroom.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.007
Sorry.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.743
ROBINETTE:
It would have helped
to have gotten it in.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.010
It could have gone
both ways.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.713
He said they didn't
believe in doctors.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.582
But they both
made the call.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.450
I don't know-- I think
the possibility of conviction

39:47.452 --> 39:48.852
is on life-support.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.955
In the history of your church,

39:51.957 --> 39:56.960
have the attitudes towards
spiritual healing ever changed?

39:56.962 --> 39:59.829
We take biblical injunctions
literally.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.966
Have you witnessed
successful examples

40:02.968 --> 40:04.667
of spiritual
healing?

40:04.669 --> 40:06.069
They're all successful.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.638
CARPENTER:
Even if someone dies?

40:08.640 --> 40:13.843
Someone lives, someone dies--
it is all God's will.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.713
The soul is eternal.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.715
CARPENTER:
Thank you, sir.

40:18.717 --> 40:19.916
No further questions.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.489
Uh, Reverend Morley,
does your church's doctrine

40:26.491 --> 40:29.025
ever allow a doctor
to be called?

40:29.027 --> 40:31.561
Only in certain
extreme situations.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.867
And Dinah Driscoll's situation
was not extreme?

40:37.869 --> 40:41.538
If a mother's life is threatened
in childbirth,

40:41.540 --> 40:44.607
midwives or doctors
may be called.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.009
No other situation?

40:46.912 --> 40:48.645
No.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.880
So if I understand you
correctly,

40:50.882 --> 40:53.683
when a mother's life is in
danger, a doctor can be called,

40:53.685 --> 40:55.885
but if a child's life's
in danger,

40:55.887 --> 40:57.520
it's allowed to die?

40:57.522 --> 40:58.655
Objection.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.689
Withdrawn.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.125
Reverend, do you believe

41:02.127 --> 41:06.095
that all religious rituals
should be protected by law?

41:06.097 --> 41:08.031
Objection. Relevance.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.999
Overruled.
I'll allow it.

41:10.001 --> 41:14.103
I believe that the government
should follow the Constitution

41:14.105 --> 41:16.840
and allow us
freedom of religion.

41:16.842 --> 41:20.577
So that if a church doctrine
called for beating children

41:20.579 --> 41:22.645
or allowing them
to handle poisonous snakes...

41:22.647 --> 41:24.047
What if a religious ritual

41:24.049 --> 41:25.949
called for leaving children
naked in the snow?

41:25.951 --> 41:27.584
Objection.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.552
KURLAND:
Mr. Stone...

41:29.554 --> 41:32.021
Your Honor,
I'm through with this witness.

41:34.926 --> 41:38.027
CARPENTER:
Mrs. Driscoll,
do you blame yourself

41:38.029 --> 41:40.997
for your daughter's
death?

41:48.607 --> 41:51.741
I did what was right.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.109
Maybe if...

41:53.111 --> 41:57.013
if I had a fuller
understanding of God,

41:57.015 --> 41:59.015
Dinah would be alive.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.852
Are you planning
to have another child?

42:02.854 --> 42:05.088
Yes.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.156
If your third child
became sick,

42:07.158 --> 42:10.193
would you go to a doctor?

42:11.963 --> 42:16.032
Only if spiritual healing
didn't help.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.636
Only as a last resort.

42:19.638 --> 42:22.639
Thank you.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.908
No further questions.

42:24.910 --> 42:27.010
Mrs. Driscoll,
we've heard testimony

42:27.012 --> 42:29.846
that the night
before your daughter died

42:29.848 --> 42:32.015
you and your husband argued
about treating her.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.116
Is that true?

42:33.118 --> 42:35.218
We had a disagreement.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.186
Weren't you shouting?

42:37.188 --> 42:40.089
We may have raised our voices.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.025
And what did you
disagree about?

42:42.027 --> 42:44.127
Calling a doctor.

42:44.129 --> 42:46.829
Did Dinah want a doctor?

42:46.831 --> 42:48.932
She wanted to know
why her friends

42:48.934 --> 42:50.700
had doctors and she didn't.

42:50.702 --> 42:53.002
And did you want
to summon medical help?

42:58.143 --> 43:01.744
No one's faith is perfect.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.013
Ted helped me

43:04.015 --> 43:07.116
to recover my sense
of faith in God's will.

43:07.118 --> 43:10.019
Answer the question,
Mrs. Driscoll.

43:10.021 --> 43:13.089
I'm trying to, Your Honor.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.161
I was afraid.

43:18.163 --> 43:20.763
Ted and I talked.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.899
What did you talk about?

43:22.901 --> 43:23.900
Mr. Carpenter?

43:23.902 --> 43:26.069
No objection, Your Honor.

43:26.071 --> 43:30.907
The law does not require that
the witness answer questions

43:30.909 --> 43:33.042
about her husband,
Mrs. Driscoll.

43:33.044 --> 43:35.144
You may answer or not.

43:37.148 --> 43:40.984
Ted said he couldn't stand
to see me so upset.

43:47.125 --> 43:50.059
He said he wanted
to call a doctor.

43:50.061 --> 43:53.997
He started
to call for help,

43:53.999 --> 43:56.899
and I told him no.

43:56.901 --> 44:00.303
He was putting<i> his</i> soul
in danger

44:00.305 --> 44:03.039
to save Dinah's life

44:03.041 --> 44:05.208
because of my pain.

44:05.210 --> 44:08.011
Just because of me.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.883
JUDGE:
To reach a guilty verdict

44:13.885 --> 44:17.954
in the charge of manslaughter
in the second degree

44:17.956 --> 44:20.323
the jury must find

44:20.325 --> 44:23.926
that the defendants
recklessly caused the death

44:23.928 --> 44:26.963
of Dinah Driscoll.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.999
As to the charge of endangering
the welfare of a child,

44:30.001 --> 44:33.870
I further instruct you
that the Church of All Saints

44:33.872 --> 44:36.172
is a well-established church,

44:36.174 --> 44:38.174
and you may not consider

44:38.176 --> 44:41.110
the prudence
of spiritual healing.

44:41.112 --> 44:44.013
Now you may consider

44:44.015 --> 44:45.815
whether the defendants

44:45.817 --> 44:48.985
at a time their daughter
was extremely ill,

44:48.987 --> 44:52.955
sincerely believed
in the legitimacy

44:52.957 --> 44:55.792
of their religion

44:55.794 --> 44:59.862
to cure illness
without benefit of medical help.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.164
He buried the distinction.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.066
They will think
spiritual healing

45:03.068 --> 45:04.934
is a defense for manslaughter.

45:04.936 --> 45:06.302
Why did he do it?

45:06.304 --> 45:07.804
Eight, nine other
state judges

45:07.806 --> 45:09.939
frame their instructions
the same way.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.407
He practically guarantees
acquittal

45:11.409 --> 45:12.809
on endangering
and manslaughter.

45:12.811 --> 45:14.177
They should acquit
on endangering.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.079
That's what
the law says.

45:16.081 --> 45:17.497
And manslaughter?

45:17.498 --> 45:18.914
You think they will understand
the difference?

45:18.917 --> 45:20.183
That's not
what worries me.

45:20.185 --> 45:21.284
We know that,
technically,

45:21.286 --> 45:23.019
they're guilty
of manslaughter

45:23.021 --> 45:27.356
but does a jury
even want to make
the distinction?

45:29.160 --> 45:31.294
<i> The defendant,</i>
<i> Theodore Driscoll,</i>

45:31.296 --> 45:34.163
on the charge of endangering
the welfare of a child--

45:34.165 --> 45:36.032
how does the jury find?

45:36.034 --> 45:39.135
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.204
The defendant,
Nancy Driscoll,

45:41.206 --> 45:44.006
on the charge of endangering
the welfare of a child?

45:44.008 --> 45:45.174
How does the jury find?

45:45.176 --> 45:48.878
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.180
The defendant,
Theodore Driscoll,

45:51.182 --> 45:54.183
on the charge of manslaughter
in the second degree--

45:54.185 --> 45:56.085
how does the jury find?

45:56.087 --> 45:58.988
We find the defendant

45:58.990 --> 46:01.057
guilty.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.192
KURLAND:
The defendant,
Nancy Driscoll, on the charge

46:03.194 --> 46:06.028
of manslaughter
in the second degree--

46:06.030 --> 46:08.064
how does the jury find?

46:08.066 --> 46:11.134
We find the defendant guilty.

46:16.141 --> 46:18.141
It never ceases
to amaze me.

46:18.143 --> 46:19.475
Juries?

46:19.477 --> 46:22.078
To weed through
a complicated legal minefield,

46:22.080 --> 46:23.212
get bad instructions
from the judge,

46:23.214 --> 46:25.481
and still reach
the right verdict.

46:25.483 --> 46:28.084
What do you think
Judge Kurland
will give them?

46:28.086 --> 46:31.420
My guess? They won't spend
a night in jail.

46:31.422 --> 46:33.356
Then what the hell's the point?

46:33.358 --> 46:37.293
Well, it's on the books,
it got press.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.962
Maybe next week, next month,
three years from now,

46:39.964 --> 46:41.097
a parent<i> will</i> call a doctor

46:41.099 --> 46:43.499
because they remember
this conviction

46:43.501 --> 46:45.468
and a child<i> won't</i> die.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.471
That's the point.
