WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:05.518
is practised only by
qualified professionals.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.051
I think this abomination is the work
of someone trying to put astop to it.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.826
What do you know about the Anatomy Act?

00:11.828 --> 00:13.462
It's costing me my livelihood.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.720
- What would you do to stop it? Murder?
- Murder? I'm a businessman.

00:17.860 --> 00:21.731
Have a look for yourself. Incomings
and outgoings. It's all in here.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.178
I thought we were going to
see your nurse.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.643
Her lodgings are upstairs.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.618
Pritty gave you something
to remember him by.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.698
Now I'll do the same.
Bentley Warburton.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.178
Honourable member for Walthamstow.
I want to know his habits.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.138
Where he goes, who he knows.
Who pays him house calls.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.036
Sir Bentley Warburton? A
fellow Parliamentarian?

00:42.039 --> 00:43.102
And your opponent.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.020
- What else did you talk about?
- Her brother.

00:46.220 --> 00:50.270
Lord Hervey. He runs a hospital
of some kind. In the East End.

00:50.422 --> 00:53.138
Mr Blake said to be sure
you received this.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.178
His latest work.

00:55.180 --> 00:59.380
Should you find no use for it
I would be glad to take it from you.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.298
- Tell me about Alice.
- I saw her.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.980
I liked her dress.
She didn't want to give it up.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.060
Billy forced her.
Next day he took her away.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.618
Where?

01:12.865 --> 01:16.258
They just... go.

01:17.068 --> 01:19.338
Someone's been murdering
to undercut our trade.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.340
What if I could find them for you?

01:21.500 --> 01:24.458
An Investigation into the
Galvanic Reponse of Dead Tissue.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.738
By William Chester,
D.Phil. Christchurch. Name, please?

01:27.740 --> 01:29.740
Sir William Chester.

03:08.140 --> 03:10.100
Perhaps you need a maid, sir.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.460
I already have one.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.180
I can cook. And sew.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.860
I'll look after you
for the time being.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.773
Besides, I need you.

03:23.106 --> 03:24.297
What for?

03:24.300 --> 03:27.220
Help lead me to Billy.
And Alice.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.836
That dress proves he took her.

03:31.552 --> 03:32.995
I've got my uses, then.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.462
As we all do.

03:50.893 --> 03:53.173
I don't have anything for you,
Mr Marlott.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.700
- Do you know that?
- Frankenstein. Who doesn't?

04:01.020 --> 04:03.140
Me. Until yesterday.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.391
- Tell me about it.
- You didn't see the play?

04:07.587 --> 04:11.298
Edmund Peake's Performers.
Three or four summers back.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.749
That season's hot ticket until
Parliament shut it down.

04:14.752 --> 04:15.899
Why's that?

04:15.902 --> 04:20.338
Blasphemy. It's about this madman
who finds a way to resurrect...

04:20.339 --> 04:22.340
I know.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.540
The whole world went twice.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.980
Except you, apparently.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.218
- It set off quite a trend, for a while.
- Trend for what?

04:32.220 --> 04:36.258
Mothers giving birth to serpent children,
people turning into wolves at midnight.

04:36.260 --> 04:38.298
Which came first? Book or play?

04:38.300 --> 04:40.300
Book, of course.

04:40.940 --> 04:44.778
- What do you know about the author?
- Mary Shelley. One of Byron's crowd.

04:44.780 --> 04:49.244
A rum lot. You've heard of him, surely?

04:49.247 --> 04:50.217
No.

04:50.220 --> 04:52.180
The Vampire Lord?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.497
Poet, seducer, traitor...

04:56.500 --> 04:58.498
Traitor?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.740
Speaking up for Boney, as I recall.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.738
Don't know much, do you?

05:03.740 --> 05:06.263
I fought against Bonaparte
at Waterloo.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.514
I know that much.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.260
Your turn now, Mr Marlott.

05:15.511 --> 05:17.618
You said there'd be a story for me
if I was to help you.

05:17.620 --> 05:21.541
Well, I have.
So let's have it.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.300
I'll let you know. In time.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.740
You promised me a story, Mr Marlott!

06:18.380 --> 06:20.540
The gentleman that came in.
Where is he?

06:20.700 --> 06:23.500
- What gentleman?
- I saw him enter not one minute ago.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.458
- Bentley Warburton.
- I'm sorry, young man.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.780
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.420
- Is there another way out of here?
- Do you see one?

06:45.620 --> 06:48.138
- How could it be possible?
- I don't know, sir.

06:48.140 --> 06:52.058
I didn't take my eyes from him. One
second he was there, the next, gone.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.417
People just don't disappear
into smoke, Nightingale.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.618
No, sir.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.695
Look, I'll keep on him
like a barnacle next time.

06:57.696 --> 06:58.942
Next time?

06:59.980 --> 07:02.498
The girl from Cloth Fair's turned
up. Flora.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.538
- Billy's girl?
- The same.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.578
It was Billy that took Alice,
the butcher's daughter.

07:07.580 --> 07:11.538
It was her dress.
You're to buy Flora a new one.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.698
And bring the old one back
as evidence.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.700
Think you can manage it?

07:15.940 --> 07:20.128
Oh, and Nightingale? She's an
important witness. Don't lose her.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.380
Yes, sir.

07:26.020 --> 07:28.260
- Kentish Town!
- Right you are, sir.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.860
Who shall conceive the horrors
of my secret toil,

07:41.580 --> 07:45.180
as I dabbled among the unhallowed
damps of the grave?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.938
I collected bones
from charnel-houses,

07:48.940 --> 07:52.378
and disturbed,
with profane fingers,

07:52.380 --> 07:55.860
the tremendous secrets
of the human frame.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.778
Mrs Shelley?

08:11.780 --> 08:13.818
Mr Marlott.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.498
I take it you've come to bring me
Mr Blake's work.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.978
Not on this occasion.
May I come in, please?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.460
I will be brief.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.260
You find me at work.
I'm a writer.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.558
I know.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.220
You've met my creature.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.820
Indeed. And was...

08:38.500 --> 08:40.498
unsettled by it.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.620
Some might say
that was its intention.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.458
May I ask how it originated?

08:45.460 --> 08:48.781
It came to me in a nightmare.

08:50.580 --> 08:54.458
Hardly seems possible.
A gentlewoman of letters.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.700
Proving how little you can tell
from outward appearances.

08:57.820 --> 09:02.300
But we can't control our nightmares,
can we, Mr Marlott?

09:04.140 --> 09:07.180
The science in this story.
How did you come upon it?

09:07.300 --> 09:10.098
I invented it. I should have
thought that obvious.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.458
- Galvanism?
- Galvani was real, of course.

09:12.460 --> 09:16.060
But his theories have no such
application as they find in my book.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.340
Or certainly not to my knowledge.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.938
- And where did you encounter them?
- Through my husband, Percy.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.420
- A surgeon?
- A poet.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.620
May I speak with him?

09:27.580 --> 09:30.140
I'm a widow these last four years.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.460
Oh, my condolences.

09:33.860 --> 09:36.060
The stitching together of corpses?

09:36.580 --> 09:41.138
- Quite an unusual notion, isn't it?
- You might call it a...

09:41.140 --> 09:44.780
parody of the Resurrection.
What brings you here, Mr Marlott?

09:45.300 --> 09:48.460
You don't strike me as a man
for idle speculation.

09:48.620 --> 09:52.498
- A crime I'm investigating.
- The missing girl? Alice?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
Yes. And others, too.

09:54.980 --> 09:57.818
I still don't see how it relates to
my poor creature.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.580
Or, indeed, to the late
Mr Blake's work.

10:01.020 --> 10:03.380
You don't think we're responsible,
do you?

10:03.580 --> 10:06.180
I don't know what to think yet,
Mrs Shelley.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.540
How did you and Mr Blake
come to know each other?

10:10.660 --> 10:13.578
He was a friend of my mother's.
Mary Wollstonecraft.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.580
A novelist, like me.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.402
Until I killed her.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.980
She died at my birth.

10:22.340 --> 10:25.839
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Any further questions?

10:26.780 --> 10:28.778
The title. Why Prometheus?

10:28.780 --> 10:32.180
He stole fire from the gods
and moulded human flesh from clay.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.778
Like my Victor.
A symbol of rebellion.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.700
- For you and Blake both?
- For all of us...

10:39.020 --> 10:42.041
who oppose tyranny and oppression.

10:42.180 --> 10:46.380
Tyranny and oppression?
Or the laws of God?

10:47.540 --> 10:50.573
What would he not do
to defeat death, Mr Marlott?

10:51.580 --> 10:54.140
Might we not defy God's laws...

10:55.940 --> 10:59.245
in order to be reunited
with those we love?

11:03.066 --> 11:05.026
Percy!

11:05.940 --> 11:08.780
Percy, there's someone
I want you to meet.

11:08.980 --> 11:10.940
Percy, say hello to Mr Marlott.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.940
How do you do, sir?

11:14.940 --> 11:16.900
My family, Mr Marlott.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.980
Mother, sister...

11:23.100 --> 11:26.620
daughters, husband.

11:28.094 --> 11:29.231
All dead.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.780
If you're seeking to understand
my nightmares,

11:34.220 --> 11:36.900
you probably need look no further
than that.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.740
I wonder at your purpose here,
Mr Marlott.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.338
People like myself and Mr Blake

11:45.340 --> 11:47.818
create things that are strange
and uncanny,

11:47.820 --> 11:50.780
where men may find themselves
reflected.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.858
Sometimes, people like yourself

11:53.860 --> 11:58.300
mistakenly come to us when strange
and uncanny things happen to them.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.618
Rather than looking in the mirror...

12:02.620 --> 12:06.180
and facing what is strange
and uncanny in themselves.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.180
Could I be right?

12:12.900 --> 12:16.062
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Good day.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.634
Pack some clothes and your school
books. We're leaving immediately.

12:28.637 --> 12:30.860
- Why, Mama?
- Do as I say.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.740
What would he not do
to defeat death, Mr Marlott?

12:40.026 --> 12:42.211
Might we not defy God's laws...

12:43.700 --> 12:46.660
in order to be reunited
with those we love?

14:17.311 --> 14:19.309
It's all right.

14:19.311 --> 14:21.311
I work for Mr Marlott.

14:21.711 --> 14:24.951
- I weren't thieving. Honest.
- I didn't say you were.

14:25.951 --> 14:29.551
- What are you doing?
- Trying to put them in order.

14:29.554 --> 14:30.753
Why?

14:31.631 --> 14:35.231
My Nan used to have cards
like them. Tarot.

14:36.471 --> 14:39.951
If you put them the right way
they can tell you the future.

14:41.926 --> 14:43.886
I'm to buy you a new dress.

14:51.446 --> 14:53.406
Careful! Careful.

14:57.406 --> 14:59.366
Thank you, sir.

15:01.346 --> 15:03.306
Joseph.

15:18.646 --> 15:20.644
Shall I throw it away, sir?

15:20.646 --> 15:22.646
No. No, I'll take it.

15:34.766 --> 15:38.764
Bring it back when it starts getting tight.
I'll put a panel in the sides.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.766
That way she can still wear it
when her time gets close.

15:45.246 --> 15:47.206
Why didn't you tell me?

15:48.246 --> 15:51.086
- I wasn't sure.
- Well, you are now.

15:55.035 --> 15:56.995
Does Billy know?

15:57.395 --> 15:59.355
He thought I was a virgin.

16:00.355 --> 16:03.235
- He was saving me.
- For himself?

16:04.515 --> 16:06.475
For a gentleman.

16:07.155 --> 16:09.115
But he spoiled the deal.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.315
- How?
- Kept upping the price on him.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.553
Billy didn't know, but...

16:15.555 --> 16:18.995
the gent he was trying to cheat
found me in the market one day.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.315
He forced himself on you?

16:24.475 --> 16:26.435
He bought me things.

16:27.155 --> 16:29.835
That print of the lost girl
I had up on my wall.

16:31.995 --> 16:36.541
One day he gave me a drink.
When I woke, he was gone.

16:38.395 --> 16:41.315
- He didn't visit you again?
- Why would he?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.835
Or tell you his name?

16:44.715 --> 16:48.355
- You didn't tell Billy?
- He'd have said it was my fault.

16:52.199 --> 16:53.713
I'm going to get rid of it.

16:53.715 --> 16:57.193
No. You'll do no such thing.

16:57.195 --> 16:59.515
- What do you care?
- It's a life!

16:59.635 --> 17:01.595
What about my life?

17:02.115 --> 17:04.075
Who will take me like this?

17:06.115 --> 17:07.153
I will.

17:09.281 --> 17:11.118
You can't.

17:11.122 --> 17:13.352
I've got lodgings in Borough.
She can come as my maid.

17:13.355 --> 17:16.115
- And when she's due?
- I'll say it's mine.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.768
I mean it.

17:23.635 --> 17:25.595
I have a better idea.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.755
- Lord Hervey.
- What about him?

17:28.875 --> 17:32.075
He runs a hospital of some kind.
In the East End.

17:32.195 --> 17:36.075
I've already looked into him.
And I intend to do so further.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.315
- Lady Hervey?
- Mr Marlott.

17:39.435 --> 17:43.155
How kind of you to call. Unfortunately
you find me on my way out.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.835
May I walk with you?

17:48.195 --> 17:50.645
Mr Marlott will accompany me today, Lloris.

17:50.647 --> 17:51.956
As you wish, my Lady.

17:57.635 --> 18:00.035
A young girl has come to me
for protection.

18:00.235 --> 18:02.195
A stray.

18:02.395 --> 18:06.073
- I need somewhere to place her.
- As a domestic?

18:06.075 --> 18:08.075
She's with child.

18:08.395 --> 18:10.635
Left to herself, I fear she may harm it.

18:10.638 --> 18:11.766
How dreadful.

18:13.355 --> 18:16.793
When we spoke before you mentioned
your brother's hospital.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.353
Might there... be a place
for her there?

18:19.355 --> 18:21.355
Until her term is out?

18:22.595 --> 18:26.833
You wouldn't play me for a fool,
would you, Mr Marlott?

18:26.835 --> 18:28.833
I don't follow, my Lady.

18:28.835 --> 18:31.715
Daniel's no favourite of
Sir Robert's, as you know.

18:31.915 --> 18:34.273
And you're his agent.
If you were looking

18:34.275 --> 18:36.520
for some means to place him
under surveillance...

18:36.523 --> 18:37.807
I've come to you in good faith,

18:38.270 --> 18:41.914
on behalf of this
unfortunate creature.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.715
And her child.

18:45.675 --> 18:47.635
As a Christian.

18:49.835 --> 18:53.395
I...apologise for doubting you.

18:53.795 --> 18:55.755
It was unworthy.

19:00.155 --> 19:02.915
Will you join me?
Inside?

19:04.835 --> 19:06.795
Of course.

19:14.944 --> 19:18.993
♪ He'll with a giant fight ♪

19:18.995 --> 19:25.395
♪ But he will have a right
to be a pilgrim ♪

19:26.035 --> 19:30.233
♪ Hobgoblin, nor foul fiend ♪

19:30.235 --> 19:33.835
♪ Can daunt his spirit ♪

19:34.115 --> 19:37.913
♪ He knows he at the end ♪

19:37.915 --> 19:41.675
♪ Shall life inherit ♪

19:41.875 --> 19:46.273
♪ Then fancies fly away ♪

19:46.275 --> 19:50.155
♪ He'll fear not what men say ♪

19:50.315 --> 19:57.155
♪ He'll labour night and day
to be a pilgrim ♪

19:59.035 --> 20:00.995
Let us pray.

20:06.515 --> 20:10.075
Dost thou, John,
renounce the devil and all his works?

20:11.755 --> 20:15.115
Dost thou renounce the carnal
desires of the flesh...

20:16.275 --> 20:19.195
so that thou will not follow,
nor be led by them?

20:21.435 --> 20:23.395
I renounce them all.

20:30.275 --> 20:31.452
Poor mite.

20:37.155 --> 20:39.475
I baptise thee, Katherine,

20:39.835 --> 20:41.833
in the name of the Father,

20:41.835 --> 20:45.515
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

20:46.595 --> 20:49.635
To you, gentle Father
we humbly commit this child,

20:50.235 --> 20:52.195
so precious in your sight.

20:53.155 --> 20:55.155
Welcome her into your presence

20:55.755 --> 20:58.075
where there is no sorrow nor pain,

20:58.715 --> 21:02.755
but the fullness of peace
and joy with you

21:03.515 --> 21:05.475
for ever and ever.

21:06.275 --> 21:08.395
Amen.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.035
Mr Marlott?

21:22.115 --> 21:24.075
Excuse me.

21:43.675 --> 21:46.355
I know how prayer can prompt
unwanted thoughts.

21:48.155 --> 21:50.315
Perhaps it might help you
to share them.

21:52.195 --> 21:54.355
My wife and daughter died...

21:55.395 --> 21:57.555
on account of my carelessness.

21:59.955 --> 22:01.292
How terrible for you.

22:02.235 --> 22:03.627
Worse for them.

22:05.475 --> 22:06.735
Maybe not.

22:13.955 --> 22:15.289
Come.

22:15.955 --> 22:17.586
We can discuss this girl.

22:25.681 --> 22:27.641
You can't make me go.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.435
- You'll do as you're told.
- May I have a word, sir?

22:36.995 --> 22:38.955
I fear that this ain't right, sir.

22:39.195 --> 22:42.233
She's with child. This may be
putting her in harm's way.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.273
I need a place to keep her safe.

22:44.275 --> 22:47.482
And a reason to take a closer look
at this man and his hospital.

22:47.485 --> 22:50.475
- This gives me both.
- What of her safety, sir?

22:50.595 --> 22:53.193
I'll judge the place and the man
when I see them.

22:53.195 --> 22:56.315
If I fear for her safety
I won't leave her there. Swear it?

22:57.475 --> 22:59.875
- What do you mean by do I swear it?
- Sorry, sir.

23:00.995 --> 23:02.737
- Good day.
- Ma'am.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.597
What now, sir?

23:04.755 --> 23:08.153
Go back to Bow Street. Tell
Forrester you're at his disposal.

23:08.155 --> 23:10.155
I've no further use for you.

23:24.995 --> 23:27.195
Mr Marlott has told me
of your condition.

23:27.715 --> 23:30.864
This place isn't like other hospitals.
You'll be looked after.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.423
No-one will hurt you
or do anything against your wishes.

23:33.476 --> 23:37.675
If you don't like it,
you'll be free to leave. We promise.

23:38.715 --> 23:40.359
Isn't that so, Mr Marlott?

23:41.767 --> 23:42.976
Yes.

23:52.995 --> 23:56.313
- I want to withdraw my funds.
- May I have your account details?

23:56.315 --> 23:58.673
I don't have them with me.
The manager knows me.

23:58.675 --> 24:01.793
Tom Pritty of Hatton Gardens.
I've banked here ten years.

24:01.795 --> 24:04.835
If you'd care to take a seat
while we do the formalities?

24:05.955 --> 24:08.155
I'm in a hurry.
We'll be as quick as we can.

24:18.235 --> 24:20.233
Here he is now.

24:20.235 --> 24:23.155
Message from Mr Marlott.
I don't work for him no more.

24:23.555 --> 24:27.115
He's wanted at the bank.
Urgent.

24:27.395 --> 24:29.875
Collier's Bank?
The body snatcher turned up.

24:41.875 --> 24:44.960
- Why's it taking so long?
- Sorry, sir. It's a large amount of coin.

24:44.963 --> 24:46.558
We may not have it all.

24:46.561 --> 24:48.843
Give me what you have.
I'll send for the balance.

24:48.846 --> 24:50.846
I'll just tell my colleague.

24:53.315 --> 24:56.193
- Why are you sweating?
- Am I, sir?

24:58.235 --> 25:01.075
I hope, for your sake,
there's a back way out of here.

25:19.629 --> 25:21.629
Move!

25:22.115 --> 25:24.075
Out of the way!

25:28.467 --> 25:30.427
Move!

25:32.955 --> 25:34.915
Out of the way!

25:35.515 --> 25:37.475
Oi! You want to watch out!

25:46.781 --> 25:48.741
How did you find me?

25:49.235 --> 25:52.915
Your account book gave us
the name of your bank.

25:53.435 --> 25:56.833
You greedy bastard. You had to
come back for it, didn't you?

25:56.835 --> 25:59.635
You can't blame me.
I've got a family to look after.

26:14.755 --> 26:17.075
Get up.
Get up!

26:19.915 --> 26:22.515
Fat lot of good you'll do them
at the end of a rope.

26:23.155 --> 26:26.073
- Good punch. Yeah?
- I ain't going to run again.

26:26.075 --> 26:29.233
- I'll find the killers for you, I swear.
- So why didn't you?

26:29.235 --> 26:31.275
I'm scared of them.

26:31.955 --> 26:36.275
- More than the drop?
- Aye. Maybe.

26:37.974 --> 26:39.934
Come on.

26:46.159 --> 26:48.917
Mittram Abbey. My family bought it
from the Crown

26:48.919 --> 26:51.359
when King Henry dissolved
the monasteries.

26:51.599 --> 26:53.559
In the days when we had money.

26:54.199 --> 26:56.559
Appearances can deceive, Mr Marlott.

26:57.079 --> 26:59.906
Daniel's work is funded by what
remains of our inheritance.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.381
The rest comes from charity.

27:12.279 --> 27:14.277
What are you doing here?

27:14.279 --> 27:17.399
Don't fret, brother.
I've brought you a patient. Flora?

27:18.439 --> 27:21.837
What's wrong with her? Her guardian
wants her safely housed.

27:21.839 --> 27:23.839
Till her confinement.

27:25.679 --> 27:27.639
Peel's man? Here?

27:28.279 --> 27:30.879
Mr Marlott wanted to see
where she'd be staying.

27:31.039 --> 27:32.219
This is not a hostel.

27:32.222 --> 27:34.581
He's come to us for help, Daniel. Please.

27:37.439 --> 27:39.437
There is a spare room in the tower.

27:39.439 --> 27:44.119
Thank you, dear brother.
I'll settle her in. Flora?

27:52.039 --> 27:55.839
- Child's yours, I take it?
- Would it matter?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.759
I noticed your condition
when we met.

27:59.039 --> 28:01.037
It's hereditary.

28:01.039 --> 28:04.279
- The child's not mine.
- Then what's your interest in her?

28:04.799 --> 28:07.679
She's an important witness.
I'm from Bow Street.

28:08.159 --> 28:10.399
- I thought you worked for Sir Robert.
- I do.

28:10.919 --> 28:15.399
And your decision to bring her here
purely fortuitous, I suppose?

28:15.519 --> 28:19.559
No. I heard about your work
from Lady Hervey.

28:22.399 --> 28:24.559
I'm on my rounds.
Come, if you wish.

28:24.799 --> 28:26.759
You can see what I do here.

28:32.559 --> 28:35.279
Why did they forbid you to speak
in Parliament?

28:36.319 --> 28:38.279
Because I would have exposed them.

28:39.799 --> 28:41.797
As what?

28:41.799 --> 28:46.599
Liars. Hypocrites. Monsters.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.327
- Sir Robert?
- And Sir William.

28:49.330 --> 28:51.961
He was my teacher when I was 17.

28:53.359 --> 28:55.319
You studied surgery?

28:55.679 --> 28:57.677
For a term.

28:57.679 --> 28:59.799
- Then abandoned it.
- Why?

29:00.119 --> 29:02.957
I don't believe one can discover
the secrets of life

29:02.959 --> 29:04.959
by cutting up the dead.

29:06.039 --> 29:08.999
Or by artificially animating them
with electricity.

29:09.159 --> 29:11.159
- You mean galvanism?
- Charlatanism.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.319
How long have you had
your condition?

29:19.559 --> 29:21.519
Several years now. On and off.

29:22.119 --> 29:23.555
Are you treating it?

29:25.039 --> 29:26.307
Mercury?

29:28.692 --> 29:31.332
That will send you mad
before the syphilis does.

29:32.039 --> 29:34.197
I have a natural remedy.

29:34.199 --> 29:36.677
Experimental, but promising.
Derived from...

29:36.679 --> 29:38.679
I'm not here to discuss my ailment.

29:42.399 --> 29:44.359
As you wish.

29:53.999 --> 29:57.639
Cave baestiam.
Beware the Beast.

29:59.199 --> 30:01.959
The monks who ran this place
kept a menagerie here.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.559
I use it as a hospice.

30:25.599 --> 30:27.559
She has a tumour.

30:27.759 --> 30:30.336
The surgeons would take a knife to it.

30:30.339 --> 30:31.557
And your method?

30:31.559 --> 30:34.079
Using natural remedies
to ease her agony.

30:34.279 --> 30:36.277
You can't cure her?

30:36.279 --> 30:38.279
No more can they.

30:38.799 --> 30:42.079
There is very little we can do
that nature can't, Mr Marlott.

30:48.406 --> 30:50.366
This one might interest you.

31:01.039 --> 31:03.839
Syphilis. Tertiary phase.

31:22.119 --> 31:25.599
Shh. There, there. Shh.
It's all right.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.679
It's all right, it's all right.

31:29.239 --> 31:35.319
Good.
It's all right. Shh.

31:52.439 --> 31:55.119
You often get these fits
in the final stages.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.959
Your treatment didn't work, then.

32:08.439 --> 32:10.399
Too late, in this case.

32:10.559 --> 32:12.519
And in mine?

32:15.839 --> 32:19.639
Maybe not. Though you might
want to act quickly, Mr Marlott.

32:20.319 --> 32:22.317
If Sir Robert's Anatomy Act passes

32:22.319 --> 32:26.319
I shall be forbidden from charging for
my practice and have to shut down.

32:26.439 --> 32:29.437
How much do you require
for the girl's accommodation?

32:29.439 --> 32:31.439
As much as you think it worth.

32:32.679 --> 32:35.239
I'll make provision
with Lady Hervey, if I may.

32:35.919 --> 32:39.119
I take it then that you are
satisfied with our level of care.

32:39.559 --> 32:43.359
My thanks to you and Lady Hervey.
I must get back to London.

33:32.759 --> 33:34.757
People like myself and Mr Blake

33:34.759 --> 33:37.237
create things
that are strange and uncanny,

33:37.239 --> 33:39.639
where men may
find themselves reflected.

33:43.279 --> 33:45.999
Sometimes, people like yourself

33:46.319 --> 33:50.319
mistakenly come to us when strange
and uncanny things happen to them.

33:52.519 --> 33:54.519
Rather than looking in the mirror...

33:54.959 --> 33:58.119
and facing what is strange
and uncanny in themselves.

34:51.079 --> 34:53.917
To you, gentle Father
we humbly entrust this child,

34:53.918 --> 34:55.918
so precious in your sight.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.359
Welcome her into your presence

34:59.919 --> 35:01.879
where there is no sorrow nor pain,

35:03.132 --> 35:05.092
but the fullness of peace and joy

35:05.919 --> 35:08.439
with you
for ever and ever.

35:46.828 --> 35:48.788
You missed a bit.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.348
Long way from home, ain't you?

35:53.068 --> 35:55.188
Saints preserve us!

35:56.388 --> 35:59.428
At least my goods is warm. Ha!

36:00.508 --> 36:03.706
That's what I wanted to talk to you
about. Warm goods.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.708
Do you remember what you told me?

36:06.908 --> 36:08.868
No.

36:09.388 --> 36:15.628
- Will three kings help you remember?
- Five? Maybe.

36:19.148 --> 36:21.666
The murderer you're looking for,
Mr Marlott?

36:21.668 --> 36:24.026
I think I've found a way
to get to him. How?

36:24.028 --> 36:26.266
A puer gatherer, Edward Barkis.

36:26.268 --> 36:29.346
He says he can set up a meet
with him tonight, ten o'clock

36:29.348 --> 36:32.268
at the Fortune of War.
Billy the child catcher?

36:32.948 --> 36:35.986
That's my guess.
What reason did you give?

36:35.988 --> 36:38.346
Trade, of course.
I said you was a surgeon.

36:38.348 --> 36:41.708
It'll cost you.
How much? Ten guineas.

36:41.868 --> 36:45.428
- How do I know he'll deliver?
- You don't. But it's the best I've got.

36:46.268 --> 36:48.266
Lock him up.

36:48.268 --> 36:50.306
My pleasure.

36:50.308 --> 36:54.146
Oi! Look here, Mr Marlott. I've done
what you asked. I've got family.

36:54.148 --> 36:57.106
I'm sure they'll survive
another night without you.

36:57.108 --> 36:59.039
Nightingale, when you're done,
come back.

36:59.388 --> 37:01.388
I may have a use for you, after all.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.268
Yes, sir.

37:16.588 --> 37:18.548
She's gone.

37:19.468 --> 37:22.835
- Mrs Shelley? When?
- Yesterday.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.346
- Her and the boy.
- Did she say where?

37:25.348 --> 37:28.868
- Not so much as a fare thee well.
- Any idea how long?

37:30.188 --> 37:32.588
Some time, though, by the looks of it.

37:32.591 --> 37:33.390
Why's that?

37:33.508 --> 37:35.468
Two trunks. Big ones.

37:37.668 --> 37:38.859
Obliged.

37:42.468 --> 37:46.506
My Lady says you may bring the boy's
things round the servants' entrance.

37:46.508 --> 37:48.828
Quickly, before Lord Shelley
returns.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.586
I don't want to stay here, Mama.

37:51.588 --> 37:54.508
I told you... I have important
business to attend to.

37:54.948 --> 37:57.346
You must stay here
with your grandparents.

37:57.348 --> 37:59.386
What business?

37:59.388 --> 38:03.308
It concerns my book.
And the gentleman who came to call.

38:03.508 --> 38:05.468
You must leave. Now!

38:06.345 --> 38:08.305
Is your book more important than me?

38:08.308 --> 38:12.268
Nothing is more important than you.

38:13.788 --> 38:17.668
But it has caused great misery
in this world.

38:18.188 --> 38:23.705
And... I must make sure
it doesn't cause any more.

38:24.508 --> 38:26.468
Great misery, indeed.

38:27.981 --> 38:29.008
Thomas.

38:29.011 --> 38:31.681
Our family name brought into disgrace.

38:31.868 --> 38:34.340
Brilliant young lives snuffed out.

38:34.588 --> 38:37.600
What next for your accursed
masterpiece, I wonder?

38:37.748 --> 38:39.946
- Thank you for taking Percy in.
- I shall...

38:45.148 --> 38:47.346
Before this
I was not unacquainted

38:47.348 --> 38:49.708
with the more obvious laws
of electricity.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.386
On this occasion
a man of great research

38:52.388 --> 38:54.428
in natural philosophy was with us.

38:54.828 --> 38:56.828
And, excited by this catastrophe,

38:57.388 --> 38:59.706
he entered on the explanation
of a theory

38:59.708 --> 39:04.228
which he had formed on the subject
of electricity and galvanism,

39:05.228 --> 39:07.908
which was at once new
and astonishing to me.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.986
Sir William.
I took the liberty

39:19.988 --> 39:22.388
of acquiring your address
from Bow Street.

39:23.708 --> 39:26.908
- You called on me while I was away.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

39:27.108 --> 39:29.868
What was it exactly you wanted
to speak to me about?

39:30.868 --> 39:35.306
The people who supply you with subjects
for dissection, the resurrectionists.

39:35.308 --> 39:39.386
I believe they may be the link I need
to track down whoever made that thing.

39:39.388 --> 39:42.013
Surely those children were murdered,
not resurrected?

39:42.224 --> 39:45.052
Seems there are resurrectionists
who murder, sir.

39:45.271 --> 39:47.221
We've all heard these rumours.

39:48.108 --> 39:51.308
You should speak to my porter,
Pirkis, about such things.

39:51.708 --> 39:54.788
- He deals with that sort of thing.
- Yes, I already did, sir.

39:55.928 --> 39:57.068
Frankenstein?

39:57.077 --> 39:59.519
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Do you know it?

39:59.715 --> 40:00.691
Heard of it.

40:00.748 --> 40:02.708
Arrant nonsense, by all accounts.

40:02.828 --> 40:04.266
Why?

40:04.445 --> 40:07.066
It concerns references to galvanism, sir.

40:07.068 --> 40:08.318
- Galvanism?
- Yes, sir.

40:08.321 --> 40:10.070
Do you know much about it?

40:10.388 --> 40:12.386
Not my subject, I'm afraid.

40:12.388 --> 40:14.708
But I doubt you'll find
anything of value

40:14.828 --> 40:16.788
in a book like this.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.908
What's your interest?

40:19.028 --> 40:22.188
Curiosity, sir.
I attended a lecture on the subject.

40:22.348 --> 40:23.482
Given by your cousin.

40:23.493 --> 40:26.269
Garnet? Yes, he has his idiosyncrasies.

40:27.148 --> 40:29.866
But, surely you've no time now
for such idleness,

40:29.868 --> 40:32.306
given the urgency
of your investigations?

40:32.308 --> 40:35.386
As it happens, I intend to
make an arrest very soon, sir.

40:35.388 --> 40:37.388
Tonight, in fact.
Billy Oates.

40:37.708 --> 40:39.668
A man who abducts children.

40:40.308 --> 40:42.948
Someone who could have made
that monstrosity?

40:43.348 --> 40:45.308
Or supplied whoever did.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.341
- Well, I won't keep you, then.
- Thank you for calling, sir.

40:52.028 --> 40:53.988
We're all fighting to the same end.

40:55.428 --> 40:56.638
The book, sir?

40:56.641 --> 41:00.270
Oh! I'll show myself out.
Thank you. Goodbye.

41:57.108 --> 41:59.068
Do you like them?

41:59.428 --> 42:01.560
- I was only looking.
- Go ahead.

42:04.908 --> 42:06.868
They're pretty.

42:07.268 --> 42:09.228
They do wonders.

42:09.348 --> 42:10.729
Like what?

42:12.908 --> 42:14.714
Stop you going blind,

42:15.788 --> 42:17.748
put you to sleep,

42:18.428 --> 42:19.679
help you breathe.

42:20.708 --> 42:22.668
Almost anything, if you know how.

42:25.188 --> 42:27.348
Is there one
for getting rid of babies?

42:28.108 --> 42:30.068
Is that what you want?

42:31.708 --> 42:33.084
Yes.

42:34.388 --> 42:37.306
I have promised Mr Marlott
that I will look after you.

42:37.308 --> 42:39.308
It's not his, though, is it?

42:43.428 --> 42:45.948
Give it to the parish
it's as good as dead.

42:46.628 --> 42:48.588
I've seen it happen.

42:49.388 --> 42:51.668
It might as well be finished now.

42:53.908 --> 42:55.868
It would be kinder that way.

42:59.188 --> 43:01.148
Please help me.

43:14.054 --> 43:16.014
Have you found her?

43:17.628 --> 43:19.588
No.

43:27.687 --> 43:29.647
But I know who took her.

43:31.868 --> 43:34.108
I'll bring him in.
When?

43:34.948 --> 43:36.908
Tonight.

43:49.508 --> 43:52.264
Smile. You're meeting a friend.

44:07.948 --> 44:09.908
Mr Marlott, Mr Barkis.

44:10.188 --> 44:12.186
Delighted.

44:12.188 --> 44:14.266
But I'm not here
to speak to Mr Barkis.

44:14.268 --> 44:16.268
Where's my man?

44:16.548 --> 44:19.348
- In the tunnels.
- What?

44:20.588 --> 44:22.548
That's what I'm to tell you.

44:23.068 --> 44:25.028
Said he'd know.

44:25.388 --> 44:27.348
Do you?

44:27.548 --> 44:29.508
Show me.

44:35.788 --> 44:37.748
This is where we keep the goods.

44:42.668 --> 44:44.628
Oh!

44:46.788 --> 44:49.348
Will Murray's. He's doing well
for himself.

44:49.908 --> 44:52.346
Here you are. Barkis?

44:52.348 --> 44:55.708
Doesn't bother me none.
I smell worse every working day.

45:01.668 --> 45:04.066
This goes down the tunnel
under the market.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.686
It's how they used to transport the
bodies from here to the hospital.

45:10.028 --> 45:11.988
Is that where he is?

45:12.108 --> 45:14.068
That's what I was told.

45:18.287 --> 45:21.007
You know the way?

45:22.148 --> 45:25.266
Well, I've been down there, but...

45:30.468 --> 45:35.148
When we get back.
I'd like it now, if you don't mind.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.668
Here.

45:43.628 --> 45:46.548
The balance on our return.
If we return.

45:49.108 --> 45:51.588
Well, we don't know
who's down there. Or what.

45:51.748 --> 45:54.428
- We'll be all on our own.
- We'll have each other.

45:59.468 --> 46:01.278
After you.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.445
Go on.
