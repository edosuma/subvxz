WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:06.072
(theme music playing)

00:19.720 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.765
(indistinct chatter, shouts)

01:08.869 --> 01:11.372
(grunting)

01:11.372 --> 01:13.340
(indistinct shouts)

01:16.777 --> 01:18.779
(grunts)

01:18.779 --> 01:21.179
(shouting)

01:22.182 --> 01:23.884
(yells)

01:23.884 --> 01:26.876
Lockjaw is looking
real mean tonight.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.363
(grunting)

01:36.363 --> 01:38.098
In his own corner,
Basher's in trouble.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.501
It's the reverse headlock!

01:40.501 --> 01:42.536
Chocolate chip
or peanut butter, sweetie?

01:42.536 --> 01:44.527
Chocolate chip, Mom.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.940
(Basher grunts)

01:46.940 --> 01:49.135
(crowd jeering)

01:52.813 --> 01:54.448
(fierce grunt)

01:54.448 --> 01:55.881
(cheering, shouting)

01:57.918 --> 02:00.352
(indistinct shouts, chatter)

02:02.823 --> 02:05.959
Rip his arm off
and feed it to him, you puke!

02:05.959 --> 02:07.517
Gouge his eyes out!

02:08.929 --> 02:10.431
-Hit him!
-Bite him!

02:10.431 --> 02:13.067
(grunting)

02:13.067 --> 02:14.935
Come on, Basher,
give him a hiplock!

02:14.935 --> 02:17.301
(grunting)

02:22.242 --> 02:23.844
(cheering, whistling)

02:23.844 --> 02:27.548
Don't try to wrestle him,
you ninny!

02:27.548 --> 02:30.451
Basher's got Lockjaw tied up
in his own corner.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.753
It looks like a great opening
for Basher.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.914
Only women fight fair!

02:38.225 --> 02:39.560
But look at that!

02:39.560 --> 02:42.229
Ryan has handed his fighter
the brass knuckles!

02:42.229 --> 02:45.733
Another typical dirty move
by Ryan!

02:45.733 --> 02:48.335
Come on, Basher, clobber him!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.895
(indistinct shouts, chatter)

02:53.207 --> 02:54.875
Go!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.110
(crowd booing)

02:56.110 --> 02:58.635
(bell clangs)

03:00.881 --> 03:02.382
(grunting)

03:02.382 --> 03:04.451
Cookies?!

03:04.451 --> 03:08.489
Didn't you forget
the strained carrots?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.650
-Ooh!
-(crowd booing)

03:14.995 --> 03:18.265
(indistinct shouts, booing)

03:18.265 --> 03:19.900
You dirty little slime.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.001
You little...

03:21.001 --> 03:23.270
(yells)

03:23.270 --> 03:24.471
0h... Whoa!

03:24.471 --> 03:25.870
(rhythmic grunting)

03:28.375 --> 03:29.977
Basher's the top dog now.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.312
That's who they're
cheering for-- hah!

03:32.312 --> 03:34.678
It ain't over yet.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.416
Whoa-whoa-whoa...!

03:40.454 --> 03:41.512
Ooh!

03:44.424 --> 03:46.827
Time for your
cookies and milk, sweetie.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.885
Okay, Mom.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.798
Basher Malone is
about to administer

03:50.798 --> 03:53.467
the coup de grace
with his patented Basher-gram.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.202
And you know what that is--

03:55.202 --> 03:58.305
that's a one-way ticket
to la-la land!

03:58.305 --> 04:00.841
(grunting, panting)

04:00.841 --> 04:02.308
(cheering)

04:16.657 --> 04:18.458
(Lockjaw grunts)

04:18.458 --> 04:20.449
Cupcake!

04:22.062 --> 04:24.231
You've had a real vendetta

04:24.231 --> 04:27.000
against the fighters
on Tippy Ryan's team

04:27.000 --> 04:29.603
ever since you came into
professional wrestling, Basher.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.438
Until I came on the scene,

04:31.438 --> 04:34.107
Tippy Ryan's thugs
were the only role models

04:34.107 --> 04:35.742
that impressionable
young children had

04:35.742 --> 04:37.444
in pro wrestling.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.682
Kids need a righteous hero,
like myself, to look up to.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.318
A square-dealing,
straight-shooting,

04:44.318 --> 04:46.253
clean-fighting man.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.521
TIPPY:
Heh!

04:47.521 --> 04:50.090
Oh-ho, this must be
a humiliating experience

04:50.090 --> 04:51.892
for you, Tippy Ryan.

04:51.892 --> 04:56.663
Basher Malone has degraded,
debased, de-maimed

04:56.663 --> 04:59.266
and dismantled every fighter
in your stable.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.567
(Tippy muttering)

05:00.567 --> 05:03.537
MAN: Tippy, what do you
want to do with this guy?

05:03.537 --> 05:06.106
(indistinct crowd shouts)

05:06.106 --> 05:08.709
Get him out of the ring,

05:08.709 --> 05:09.743
-you jerk!
-Ooh!

05:09.743 --> 05:10.744
You help him!

05:10.744 --> 05:13.614
Don't just stand there!

05:13.614 --> 05:16.550
(booing, shouting)

05:16.550 --> 05:21.655
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not a very pretty sight.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.591
(phone ringing)

05:24.591 --> 05:26.960
Yeah?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.096
Yeah, listen, boss...

05:29.096 --> 05:31.965
there's no way
I can beat Basher Malone

05:31.965 --> 05:34.468
with the wimps
you keep sending me.

05:34.468 --> 05:38.272
I need your top gun--
a skull crusher!

05:38.272 --> 05:40.974
No, no, no, no, listen, boss,

05:40.974 --> 05:44.077
if I get Basher Malone
in the ring

05:44.077 --> 05:51.885
with one of your boys from
the Fire and Brimstone League,

05:51.885 --> 05:54.554
Yeah.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.323
(chortling)

05:56.323 --> 05:58.759
And, kids, don't forget
what the Basher tells you.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.860
Brush your teeth

05:59.860 --> 06:02.162
after every meal,
do your homework,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.197
and listen to your mom
when she...

06:04.197 --> 06:06.028
(cigar hisses)

06:07.200 --> 06:10.304
I got the meanest,
the slimiest,

06:10.304 --> 06:12.706
the dirtiest fighter
of all time,

06:12.706 --> 06:16.076
if you've got the guts,
Basher Malone.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.846
What's the matter,
you need a note from your mommy?

06:19.846 --> 06:24.017
Any time and any place,
you pencil-neck.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.154
Midnight, my gym.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.190
No audience, no refs...

06:30.190 --> 06:33.023
no holds barred.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.804
Don't worry, Mom,
I know what I'm doing.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.274
I'm gonna nip this thing
right in the bud.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.277
MOM: Though I walk through
the valley of darkness,

06:50.277 --> 06:52.145
I fear no evil,

06:52.145 --> 06:54.948
because my son is
the toughest son of a gun

06:54.948 --> 06:56.984
in the whole darn valley.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.043
TIPPY:
How touching.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.880
Where's your fighter?

07:06.626 --> 07:09.429
(distorted keypad beeps)

07:09.429 --> 07:11.264
(line ringing)

07:11.264 --> 07:14.101
Yeah, this is Tippy Ryan.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.899
Can you send up
my special order, please?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.070
Of course I've got
an account with ya!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.777
Jerk.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.446
(switches clank,
electricity hums)

07:26.446 --> 07:28.648
Who are you?

07:28.648 --> 07:33.053
Myjob is to get
impressionable young kids

07:33.053 --> 07:36.656
to root for dirty fighters
like Lockjaw Lukasec!

07:36.656 --> 07:39.393
And my client
takes over from there.

07:39.393 --> 07:42.963
Well, I happen to be
very good at my work.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.333
30 years my gym has produced
a steady stream

07:46.333 --> 07:47.901
of the dirtiest fighters

07:47.901 --> 07:50.704
for the,
for the wrestling profession!

07:50.704 --> 07:53.306
My wrestlers have-have
gouged and kicked

07:53.306 --> 07:56.410
and maimed their way to the top!

07:56.410 --> 07:58.745
Most important of all...

07:58.745 --> 08:01.081
a whole generation of kids

08:01.081 --> 08:05.285
grew up with these lowlifers
as their heroes!

08:05.285 --> 08:07.421
Then you come along...

08:07.421 --> 08:10.991
and now everybody wants
to cheer for the good guy.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.194
Everybody wants to cheer
for you, Basher Malone.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.330
Everybody wants to wear
Basher Malone T-shirts

08:17.330 --> 08:20.367
and walk little old ladies
across the street.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.402
They want to look like you,
Basher Malone,

08:22.402 --> 08:26.106
they want to talk like you,
they want to dress like you!

08:26.106 --> 08:30.877
Worst of all, they want to be
drippy Goody Little Two-shoes

08:30.877 --> 08:34.748
just like you, Basher Malone!

08:34.748 --> 08:37.017
Well, you want to fight evil?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.819
I'll give you evil.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.489
I'll give you something
that a true crusader

08:42.489 --> 08:45.625
only dreams about.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.150
(eerie crackling, whirring)

08:51.098 --> 08:53.692
(whirring grows louder)

08:56.937 --> 08:59.963
(woman speaks indistinctly)

09:02.409 --> 09:04.104
Oh...

09:07.414 --> 09:10.406
(deep, distorted moaning)

09:21.461 --> 09:24.123
(growling)

09:25.665 --> 09:27.394
(growling)

09:29.936 --> 09:31.304
(whooshing stops)

09:31.304 --> 09:35.609
Basher Goody Two-shoes Malone,

09:35.609 --> 09:39.713
meet your next
and final opponent...

09:39.713 --> 09:41.715
Trog!

09:41.715 --> 09:42.841
(growling)

09:46.720 --> 09:49.712
(growling)

09:56.730 --> 09:58.960
(whirring)

10:00.534 --> 10:05.405
He's accustomed to a much
warmer climate down there.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.940
Folks...

10:06.940 --> 10:09.142
show time.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.507
(growling)

10:14.481 --> 10:17.651
All right, come on,
come on, both of you.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.819
Now, on my left...

10:19.819 --> 10:23.590
he weighs 267 pounds,

10:23.590 --> 10:25.025
he's the challenger,

10:25.025 --> 10:27.027
from Good Ship Lollipop Land...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.895
(Trog growling)

10:28.895 --> 10:30.886
...Basher Malone.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.201
TIPPY:
You might say that

10:34.201 --> 10:39.105
Trog is a true product
of his environment.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.408
His weight rises

10:41.408 --> 10:46.513
with the inverse ratio of the
purity of his opponent's soul.

10:46.513 --> 10:51.251
By that, I mean...
the more sinful his opponent,

10:51.251 --> 10:53.853
the heavier he becomes.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.088
(beeping)

10:55.088 --> 10:57.324
And some of those sinners
down there,

10:57.324 --> 11:01.094
he has hit as high
as 80,000 pounds.

11:01.094 --> 11:05.258
My boy is as pure
as the driven snow.

11:07.701 --> 11:12.105
his fight will be two falls
out of three, winner take all,

11:12.105 --> 11:15.208
and if you win, Basher...
(chortles)

11:15.208 --> 11:17.744
I will close up shop

11:17.744 --> 11:20.914
and send all my fighters

11:20.914 --> 11:23.350
back to where they came from.

11:23.350 --> 11:28.021
But if my fighter wins,
you, Basher,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.889
retire from the ring forever

11:29.889 --> 11:31.925
and Trog takes possession
of the title

11:31.925 --> 11:35.895
and Trog becomes the idol
of millions and millions

11:35.895 --> 11:38.565
of impressionable children.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.726
Oh, Basher, no.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.226
Oh.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.596
(Trog grunts)

11:49.776 --> 11:52.412
| just wanted
to wish you good luck.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.448
(Trog growling)

11:55.448 --> 11:57.517
-MOM: Basher!
-(Trog growls, Basher groans)

11:57.517 --> 11:59.452
(Trog laughs)

11:59.452 --> 12:01.154
(both grunting)

12:01.154 --> 12:02.314
(groaning)

12:04.024 --> 12:05.924
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-(Trog growling)

12:08.862 --> 12:10.864
(grunting)

12:10.864 --> 12:11.931
(coughs)

12:11.931 --> 12:13.166
All right, Trog, yeah, get him!

12:13.166 --> 12:14.401
All right, get him down there!

12:14.401 --> 12:16.603
Come on, baby,
do it for me, come on.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.366
(Trog laughing, Basher groaning)

12:25.545 --> 12:29.549
Trog T-shirts,
Trog coloring books, Trog dolls!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.551
Ursula dolls!

12:31.551 --> 12:34.654
Yeah, children playing with Trog
and Ursula dolls together!

12:34.654 --> 12:35.722
Yeah, yeah!

12:35.722 --> 12:37.090
I love it!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.124
(groans)

12:38.124 --> 12:39.125
You can't let him win, Basher.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.627
Think of the children.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.993
(Trog laughing, Basher groaning)

12:51.771 --> 12:54.374
The Basher-gram,
the Basher-gram.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.476
(both grunting)

12:56.476 --> 12:58.745
Send him back
where he came from.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.613
(both grunting)

13:00.613 --> 13:04.017
The harder you strain,
the heavier he gets.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.453
My Basher's a good boy.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.622
The Greeks call it hubris--

13:09.622 --> 13:12.158
the sin of excessive pride.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.360
Basher Malone

13:13.360 --> 13:15.462
has a very high opinion
of himself.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.730
Don't you, Basher?

13:16.730 --> 13:19.324
(both grunting)

13:20.367 --> 13:22.769
Yeah, with Basher's ego,

13:22.769 --> 13:27.706
I figure Trog ought to top
900 pounds before he's through.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.579
(both grunting)

13:38.485 --> 13:40.976
-(Trog laughing)
-Whoa!

13:43.423 --> 13:46.593
(both grunting)

13:46.593 --> 13:47.660
(laughing)

13:47.660 --> 13:49.329
Good night, Irene.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.397
(laughing)

13:50.397 --> 13:51.598
(Trog growling)

13:51.598 --> 13:53.828
(Basher groaning)

13:55.835 --> 13:58.099
(Trog chuckling)

14:00.140 --> 14:02.199
(Trog laughing, growling)

14:08.281 --> 14:12.085
"Blessed are the meek, for they
shall inherit the earth."

14:12.085 --> 14:14.144
(chuckles)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.428
What am I gonna do?

14:21.428 --> 14:23.163
I can't win
without my Basher-gram.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.165
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.834
I've been working
on some strategy.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.169
I don't need no strategy.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.570
I'm the best there is.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.835
Nobody can beat me
two out of three falls.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.336
(growling)

14:46.586 --> 14:48.577
(Basher groans)

14:51.391 --> 14:53.791
(Trog growling, Basher groaning)

15:01.701 --> 15:04.295
All right, put him away,
put him away.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.407
(Basher yells)

15:07.407 --> 15:10.274
(both grunting)

15:14.514 --> 15:17.381
(Trog laughing, Basher groaning)

15:18.918 --> 15:20.286
(laughter)

15:20.286 --> 15:26.359
(Basher groaning)

15:26.359 --> 15:28.350
Go, go!

15:41.941 --> 15:44.569
(Trog grunting)

15:47.180 --> 15:48.477
URSULA:
Oh... oh!

15:49.549 --> 15:50.984
(Ursula grunting)

15:50.984 --> 15:53.253
You look a little peaked.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.121
How about
some ice-cold lemonade?

15:55.121 --> 15:57.282
(Trog screams, Ursula gasps)

15:59.792 --> 16:01.928
Just trying to be helpful.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.294
(grunting)

16:07.500 --> 16:09.491
(Trog screeching)

16:11.170 --> 16:13.570
(both grunting)

16:14.607 --> 16:16.609
(sobbing)

16:16.609 --> 16:17.911
(Basher grunts)

16:17.911 --> 16:20.680
One, two, three!

16:20.680 --> 16:23.649
(Mom cackling)

16:34.060 --> 16:36.051
(Tippy wheezes)

16:41.301 --> 16:43.803
(groaning)

16:43.803 --> 16:46.272
But, sweetie, you haven't had
your cookies and milk.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.274
I don't need
no cookies and milk,

16:48.274 --> 16:50.710
and I don't need my Basher-gram.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.781
I'm Basher Malone and I can lick
anybody in the place.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.283
Pride comes before the fall,
young man.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.419
That could be just
what they're counting on.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.521
-(dismissive groan)
-So you're such a big shot now,

17:01.521 --> 17:04.757
you don't have to listen
to your mom anymore.

17:04.757 --> 17:08.761
(groaning)

17:08.761 --> 17:10.263
Oh, baby, oh.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.254
(Ursula moaning, Trog growling)

17:24.077 --> 17:26.068
(both grunting)

17:28.748 --> 17:30.550
(Basher yells)

17:30.550 --> 17:32.919
(both grunting)

17:32.919 --> 17:36.189
Basher, no, you can't lift him.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.523
(both grunting)

17:37.523 --> 17:39.292
(Trog laughs)

17:39.292 --> 17:41.127
(Basher grunts)

17:41.127 --> 17:44.585
(Trog laughing, Basher groaning)

17:51.537 --> 17:53.368
What? What?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.609
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

17:56.609 --> 17:57.906
(Basher straining)

18:03.416 --> 18:05.748
(grunting)

18:09.589 --> 18:11.580
No, not milk! Aah!

18:13.926 --> 18:17.096
(sizzling, hissing)

18:17.096 --> 18:19.997
(screaming continues)

18:26.005 --> 18:28.530
Oh, baby.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.213
(growling):
Oh, no... Oh, no...

18:41.254 --> 18:43.256
Oh, no.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.792
You're the only friend
he ever had.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.781
(growling)

18:48.761 --> 18:50.063
(Trog chortles)

18:50.063 --> 18:52.065
(both grunting)

18:52.065 --> 18:54.056
(Trog laughing, Basher groaning)

18:56.769 --> 18:58.498
One, two...

19:00.573 --> 19:03.576
Finish him off, you wart head!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.878
(both grunting)

19:05.878 --> 19:07.313
No, no, you don't,
no more tricks.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.372
Time to get rid of this
once and for all.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.853
Mom...!

19:13.853 --> 19:15.844
(Trog chuckles)

19:17.924 --> 19:19.619
Mom!

19:22.295 --> 19:26.532
Get out of the way!

19:26.532 --> 19:28.830
(Trog grunting)

19:34.974 --> 19:36.839
(Trog grunting)

19:40.079 --> 19:42.240
(Trog whimpers, Basher grunts)

19:44.283 --> 19:46.385
(Basher laughs)

19:46.385 --> 19:48.376
(Trog whimpering)

19:50.990 --> 19:52.958
Get out of the way!
Come on, move it!

19:56.729 --> 19:58.731
(Tippy muttering angrily)

19:58.731 --> 20:01.167
Move it!

20:01.167 --> 20:02.969
(chuckles nervously)

20:02.969 --> 20:05.905
I... I think you dropped this,
young lady.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.407
Bon voyage, Tippy Ryan.

20:08.407 --> 20:12.578
I'm gonna send you to Hell,
one piece at a time.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.181
Basher, it's not
for us to judge.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.217
Sorry, Mom.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.913
Basher, don't litter.

20:25.491 --> 20:29.587
(Trog grunting,
Tippy screaming)

20:47.880 --> 20:49.347
(coin clinks)

20:51.584 --> 20:54.353
When's the last time
I took you out to dinner?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.621
Neven

20:55.621 --> 20:57.723
Well, Ijust happen
to know a place

20:57.723 --> 21:01.494
where the steaks are so big,
the waiters all wear trusses.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.263
Oh.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.965
I'll take mine rare.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.956
You got it, Mom.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.013
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.416
Waiting for us to enter.

21:23.416 --> 21:27.019
Waiting to enter us.

21:27.019 --> 21:33.254
Until next time,
try to enjoy the daylight.
