00:31.220 --> 00:33.220
(BIRDSONG)

00:42.020 --> 00:43.570
You didn't quarrel, then?

00:43.620 --> 00:45.610
No. My cousin was good to me.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.370
But in the end it was another country

00:47.420 --> 00:49.170
and I'd moved away one time too many.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.610
And besides, I'd taken
Sybbie away from you.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.250
What right had I to do that?

00:53.300 --> 00:55.490
You had every right.
But it did seem a shame.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.410
I wish we had a photograph of all
our faces when you walked in.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.450
- I hope I didn't steal
their thunder. - Oh, no.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.730
I think it gave it an added lift.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.170
- How was Sybbie this morning?
- Tired.

01:05.220 --> 01:07.050
But glad to be here.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.290
What will you do, Mary,
now that Tom's home?

01:09.340 --> 01:11.450
Exactly what I was doing. Why?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.370
Well, surely he'll go
back to being the agent.

01:14.420 --> 01:17.970
Can't we allow Tom a few days to
settle in before we start fighting?

01:18.020 --> 01:21.010
You'll get no fight from me. I want
to do what's right for everyone.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.690
Come down to the office later
and I'll bring you up to date.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.010
Any word from Carson?

01:25.060 --> 01:28.170
He rang to say they'd arrived
safely, m'lord, but that's all.

01:28.220 --> 01:31.330
He could have managed something
a little better than Scarborough.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.290
I offered, but that's what they wanted.

01:33.340 --> 01:36.330
- When do we expect Rosamund?
- Tomorrow, for dinner.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.490
- Why's she coming?
- She says just to see us

01:38.540 --> 01:41.690
but I'm sure she wants to get stuck
in with the row about the hospital.

01:41.740 --> 01:44.410
At least she'll be reinforcements
for Cora and Isobel.

01:44.460 --> 01:47.900
- Do you think she'll take their side?
- Against Granny? Every time.

01:48.940 --> 01:52.650
Miss Baxter, Sergeant Willis rang
earlier. He wants to look in.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.690
- What's this?
- The sergeant is coming in later.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.210
- What for?
- To see Miss Baxter.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.570
- (BELL RINGS)
- Oh, that's her Ladyship.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.620
I must go.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.570
What do the police want with Miss Baxter?

02:10.620 --> 02:14.810
- Makes a nice change.
- Good to know we can joke about it.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.850
Well, it's no joke to Miss Baxter.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.210
- Who spoke to him?
- Sergeant Willis?

02:19.260 --> 02:22.610
- Me, I did. - Next time
run it past me, Mrs Patmore,

02:22.660 --> 02:25.570
before you issue an invitation.
I am the butler now.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.850
For the next five minutes. (SCOFFS)

02:27.900 --> 02:29.530
Until Mr Carson gets back.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.650
And don't let's forget it.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.290
When did this arrive?

02:35.340 --> 02:38.130
Mr Spratt walked up with it
first thing this morning, m'lady.

02:38.180 --> 02:40.610
Lady Grantham wants to
bring Lady Shackleton

02:40.660 --> 02:43.050
- when she comes for dinner tomorrow.
- That's nice.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.970
Is it? It's only so dear Mama has
an ally when we start fighting.

02:47.020 --> 02:50.140
She thinks Lady Rosamund and
Mrs Crawley are on my side.

02:53.060 --> 02:56.210
Hey-ho. I'll telephone when I go down.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.450
Now we're out of Edith's
earshot, what do you really want?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.650
To be joint agents? I wouldn't mind.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.970
Maybe. But if I am to
live out my life here,

03:04.020 --> 03:06.970
I need to find something to do
that isn't just about the estate.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.490
- How enterprising.
- I've changed since I've been away.

03:09.540 --> 03:12.740
I'm still not a traditionalist. The
King should not rely on my support.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.250
Which wouldn't surprise Papa.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.370
But I don't feel the
same about capitalism.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.050
Not American capitalism, anyway.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.170
Where a hardworking man
can go right to the top

03:20.220 --> 03:21.850
all the way in a single lifetime.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.850
- Which still isn't true here.
- Not yet.

03:23.900 --> 03:27.250
But I have a sense it's going to change
and in the not-too-distant future.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.490
- I hope that doesn't worry you.
- Tom, you're my brother.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.930
I want what you want. In
your work, in your life.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.250
No more Miss Buntings
if you have any pity.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.050
But even in that, don't
please us. Please yourself.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.130
What about you? Have you regretted
dismissing your suitors?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.180
No.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.410
Come in here. Mr Carson won't mind.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.460
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.250
- Good morning, Miss Baxter.
- Is this about the Bates?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.250
No, no, no. It's not about the Bates.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.970
They're off the hook.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.650
Then what's Miss Baxter done
if it's not to do with them?

04:02.700 --> 04:05.170
Would you rather I questioned
you alone, Miss Baxter?

04:05.220 --> 04:07.210
Mrs Hughes wouldn't like it.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.250
I've asked Mr Molesley to be with
me if I'm allowed. He's outside.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.810
Oh. Well, of course. If I'm not wanted...

04:13.860 --> 04:15.850
- It's not --
- I understand.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.899
I understand.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.019
Go on.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.410
I won't beat about the bush, Miss Baxter.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.730
You'll know who I mean by Mr Peter Coyle.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.970
Yes, I do.

04:32.020 --> 04:38.050
He's currently on bail for theft.
That doesn't seem to surprise you.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.330
- Correct. - He's accused
alongside a young woman

04:41.380 --> 04:42.690
who worked in the same house,

04:42.740 --> 04:45.650
and I'm afraid that most of the
evidence will count against her.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.930
Again, you do not surprise me.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.970
Well, this is it.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.290
He's pleading innocence
but our records show

04:52.340 --> 04:54.130
that while he's never been convicted,

04:54.180 --> 04:56.370
he's been close to several
crimes in the past.

04:56.420 --> 05:01.010
Always carried out by women and
he's escaped prosecution every time.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.330
We know he worked in the same house as you

05:03.380 --> 05:07.130
and that he left on the day that you
stole the jewels from your mistress.

05:07.180 --> 05:10.050
- That's true.
- And those jewels were never found

05:10.100 --> 05:12.010
and you've kept silent.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.050
But we believe he profited from the theft.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.340
We want you to testify to that
effect as a character witness.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.850
We're only trying to protect
vulnerable young women

05:24.900 --> 05:26.900
from him in the future.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.970
He's ruined several lives.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.810
I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.
Please consider my request.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.210
Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.

05:39.260 --> 05:42.210
Then I'll er, take the
liberty of calling again.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.260
Goodbye.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.700
I dare say this... Mr
Coyle was a handsome devil.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.340
He was a devil all right.

06:00.020 --> 06:03.620
I know it's not my decision,
but I think you should do it.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.740
You don't know what you're asking.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.090
"All that's needed for evil to triumph

06:10.140 --> 06:12.340
is that good men do nothing."

06:19.900 --> 06:21.890
You won't believe this, except you will.

06:21.940 --> 06:25.370
Lady Shackleton would love to
come, but can she bring her nephew?

06:25.420 --> 06:26.850
What?

06:26.900 --> 06:30.610
He's in Yorkshire for some reason
and he's only staying one night.

06:30.660 --> 06:34.530
- What did you say?
- I didn't want to put Mama's back up.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.650
Things are bad enough without that.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.690
Mama is an old intriguer.

06:38.740 --> 06:41.770
She will use tears or
terror with equal facility.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.810
- (CHUCKLES)
- Who is this man?

06:43.860 --> 06:46.130
I don't know. Her sister's son.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.810
Mrs Cobb is going to live
with her daughter in Oswaldkirk

06:49.860 --> 06:53.010
- so Mary's going to give the cottage
to the Carsons. - Excellent news.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.690
Can we discuss Yew Tree Farm?

06:55.740 --> 06:58.410
- What about it? - I don't see
why we can't get a new tenant

06:58.460 --> 07:00.610
- when the Drewes are gone.
- No, Mary's right.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.610
It makes more sense for
us to take it over.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.530
- We could let the house, of course.
- But we will have some tenants.

07:05.580 --> 07:08.250
Which reminds me, I want to
see Fairclough's new planting.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.300
- Tom, do you fancy a walk?
- Let me make a call and then I'll be with you.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.250
You're happy he's back, aren't you?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.850
I really am. Funny, isn't it?

07:18.900 --> 07:22.810
- What are the new maids like?
- Nice. Hard-working.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.370
But they don't live in.

07:24.420 --> 07:27.530
And they go home before we have our
tea so we don't really know them.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.330
Not in the old way.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.730
Miss Baxter and I turn the
beds down in the evenings.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.330
I hope you're not working too hard.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.410
I feel quite well, m'lady.
Though I'm thickening up.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.930
I saw Mr Bates eyeing me the other day.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.970
He'll think I ate all the pies.

07:41.020 --> 07:43.570
- So you still haven't told him?
- When I know it'll be fine,

07:43.620 --> 07:47.020
- he can celebrate without worrying.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)

07:47.820 --> 07:49.810
Ah, we were just talking about you.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.090
Good things I hope, m'lady.

07:51.140 --> 07:53.770
I wanted Molesley and Andrews
to take the cases down.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.810
- They've both gone
into the village. - Both?

07:55.860 --> 07:58.730
- Carson wouldn't allow that.
- When the cat's away, m'lady.

07:58.780 --> 08:00.770
Can you manage?

08:00.820 --> 08:02.090
Anna and I can take one each.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.490
No, they're too heavy for Anna to lift.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.890
Then I'll make a double journey.

08:06.940 --> 08:10.300
Rather a bore for you. The car's
waiting in the stableyard.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.970
It was sweet of them
to let me bring Henry.

08:15.020 --> 08:18.450
Though why couldn't he stay
behind with a tray on his lap?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.970
Don't be unkind. I never see him.

08:21.020 --> 08:24.610
He's only up here now to look
at some horrid racing car.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.450
- Does he get on with Philip?
- They were friends as boys.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.730
I'm afraid she doesn't
like my daughter-in-law.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.930
- Oh, dear.
- Who does?

08:31.980 --> 08:35.370
Now, you understand the job on hand?

08:35.419 --> 08:39.650
We're to persuade Lady Grantham to
oppose all change at the hospital.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.929
No, no, not quite.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.690
To oppose change that
takes control away from us.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.530
It would be so bad for the village.

08:46.580 --> 08:50.410
Forgive me, but why, if it means
more modern and varied treatment?

08:50.460 --> 08:53.490
How could the interests of
the village be protected

08:53.540 --> 08:55.690
if every decision is made in York?

08:55.740 --> 08:57.730
I see that, my dear --

08:57.780 --> 09:00.450
Are you... are you here
to help or irritate?

09:00.500 --> 09:03.780
- To help, of course.
- Then there's no more to be said.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.270
I'd like some volunteers to clean
Mrs Cobb's cottage for the Carsons.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.790
His Lordship wants it
done before they get back.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.350
I don't mind. I could go up
with the maids in the morning.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.510
It's a shame they can't
live in their own home.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.830
The builders are still in it.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.030
And they can't get there
and back without a car

09:33.080 --> 09:35.150
which is a bit revolutionary
for Mr Carson.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.360
"The Carsons." (LAUGHS)

09:38.360 --> 09:40.630
Are we gonna have to
call her "Mrs Carson"?

09:40.680 --> 09:44.430
I wish I knew how long Mr Mason's
got to wait for his farmhouse.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.990
Is this Yew Tree Farm
you're talking about?

09:47.040 --> 09:48.830
Mr Mason's taking over the lease.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.750
I don't believe so. They're going
to farm the land themselves.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.070
They may let the house, but that's it.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.470
- What are you talking about?
- I heard them discussing it yesterday

09:57.520 --> 09:59.510
- at breakfast.
- Don't say it.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.870
They couldn't turn around
like that, could they?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.230
- But they've not said they'll do it.
- They implied it.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.830
She implied it.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.790
I might go to Mrs Cobb's
cottage when they're changing.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.180
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.350
I expect he's got
something to think through.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.900
Keep your pity, Mr Molesley.
You need it more than I do.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.070
You don't have to tell me
your mother's in the right.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.470
We can't have a public quarrel

10:30.520 --> 10:32.790
or they'll both be asked
to resign from the board

10:32.840 --> 10:35.630
- and even I don't want that.
- Which means I'm not to make Granny

10:35.680 --> 10:37.510
any angrier than she is already.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.710
So how are you? What's the news?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.470
I do have some as a matter of fact.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.670
Have you heard of a place called
Hillcroft? It's in Turperton.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.470
- What sort of place?
- A college.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.630
For women from modest backgrounds.
But clever women with potential.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.630
- I'm a trustee.
- How interesting.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.910
I knew you'd think so.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.230
So I'm going to suggest
you as a trustee, too.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.150
Oddly enough, our treasurer lives up here.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.910
It's one of the reasons I've come,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.910
so I can meet him while I'm at
Downton. We'll ask him over.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.670
What's his name?

11:10.720 --> 11:13.790
John Harding. I like the sound of him.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.070
Self-made, clever, successful.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.440
And nearer your age than mine.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.110
Might I have a word, m'lady?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.830
You'll have to be quick, I'm late.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.950
It's about Miss Baxter.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.990
I hope this isn't gossip.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.310
I don't believe it is, m'lady.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.950
You couldn't be harder on those potatoes

11:46.000 --> 11:47.950
if you wanted them to confess to spying.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.790
I feel so let down.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.310
They've got Mr Mason's hopes up,
let him think he had a future

11:53.360 --> 11:55.030
- and now what?
- To be honest, Daisy,

11:55.080 --> 11:56.750
wasn't it you that put his hopes up?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.030
Only because I was sure
that's what she intended.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.630
- She's led me on.
- Maybe it just wasn't possible.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.190
Not possible? Don't
give me 'not possible'.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.840
All right, Madame Defarge,
calm down and finish that mash.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.950
The Dowager Lady Shackleton
and Mr Henry Talbot.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.030
- Ah.
- Golly.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.910
Nobody told me the nephew was you.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.910
Oh, is that what I am? "The nephew".

12:20.960 --> 12:23.070
You never said your
aunt was Lady Shackleton.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.870
Did you know she was bringing you here?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.910
One must be allowed some secrets.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.710
Of course we'll invite Mr Harding.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.630
He has a wife. We must ask her, too.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.110
It's marvellous for ordinary women
to aim at rich and fulfilling careers.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.630
They talk about making a difference
but this could actually change lives.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.510
- Why are you in Yorkshire?
- Mainly looking at a car

12:40.560 --> 12:43.310
- I might be racing at Brooklands.
- So you really are a car man?

12:43.360 --> 12:45.350
I wasn't sure how much you meant it.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.310
Oh, I really am a car man.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.070
That's not a claim you often
hear in this neck of the woods.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.310
- Did you say you race at Brooklands?
- Yes, I've driven there quite a lot.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.350
I don't envy much, but I envy that.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.630
What sort of Talbot is he?

12:57.680 --> 13:00.310
Shrewsbury. But he's
nowhere near the earldom.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.590
About 40 strong men
would have to drop dead.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.230
Well, nothing is impossible.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.670
Without it, what are his prospects?

13:09.720 --> 13:11.710
Adequate, but not overwhelming.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.910
Honestly, listen to yourselves.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.950
Lady Shackleton is quite right.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.230
Mary needs more than a handsome
smile and a hand on the gear stick.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.390
I'm surprised you know
what a gear stick is.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.680
I know more than you think.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.510
It's very kind of you to let me and
Henry push into a family party.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.270
In return, please don't let
Mama pull you into the fight.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.990
Really, Robert? You paint
me as such a schemer.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.070
No-one has sharper eyes than a loving son.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.870
You read that somewhere.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.860
Why do you never think
I can make anything up?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.630
Didn't you trust your own
powers of persuasion?

13:51.680 --> 13:55.150
- What? - Don't pretend. Who else
would her Ladyship have heard it from?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.800
I think you'll regret being silent.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.550
- (FOOTSTEPS)
- Come along, Mr Molesley.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.640
Just because Mr Carson's away...

14:05.640 --> 14:07.710
You look very preoccupied.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.510
(GASPS)

14:11.560 --> 14:13.560
Anna?

14:14.640 --> 14:16.710
- Can I help?
- I'm fine.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.560
Just carry on, as they say in the navy.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.350
The treatments available to the village

14:25.400 --> 14:28.790
would be vastly superior to
anything we can lay claim to now.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.070
You are making a grave mistake

14:31.120 --> 14:33.870
and impoverishing the village by doing so.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.920
Prudence, tell them.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.030
I expect there's a good deal
to be said on both sides.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.510
Don't be so feeble!

14:43.560 --> 14:46.750
How can I present myself as an
expert when I don't know the facts?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.790
It's never stopped me!

14:48.840 --> 14:52.350
- She's still on cracking form.
- If she were 20 years younger,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.390
you'd just call her a tyrant.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.470
Have you thought more about what
you're going to do now you're back?

14:57.520 --> 15:00.870
Before dinner, Mr Talbot was
saying he works with cars.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.990
I wonder if that mightn't be right for me.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.270
- Not as a racing car driver?
- Maybe not.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.790
- But in that world.
- Which is a long way from Downton.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.150
ROBERT: Your attitude is hardly
conducive to a peaceful settlement.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.910
I won't explain, since every
village argument is the same.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.550
Really? I'm not a village boy.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.950
My father was in Parliament
so we lived in London.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.030
Except for the summer
and then we'd shelter

15:22.080 --> 15:25.190
- with various hunting, shooting
and fishing relations. - That's us.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.640
- Yes, but it's not all you are.
- So do you make a living out of cars?

15:31.160 --> 15:34.070
Yes, I suppose I do,
yes. I race on a team.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.790
- Does that seem very odd?
- Quite odd.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.110
- Although people do such
odd things nowadays. - Mm.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.870
I once met a man who spent his time
importing guinea pigs from Peru.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.630
- (CHUCKLES) - Don't hide
behind Lady Shackleton, Mama.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.990
You're quite capable of
landing your own punches.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.310
The question is which system is more
likely to deliver modern treatment

15:53.360 --> 15:56.910
- to the local population?
- That is not the point.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.190
I should have thought
that was exactly the point.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.030
You've muddled your priorities!

16:01.080 --> 16:03.830
I suppose cousin Isobel is
entitled to put up an argument.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.080
Of course she is, she's
just not entitled to win it.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.680
(MUTTERING)

16:13.920 --> 16:16.870
I'm afraid I've been rather a
disappointment to your mother.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.110
Not to me. You could have
made things even worse.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.750
So, do you ever make it up to London?

16:22.800 --> 16:25.670
- Sometimes.
- Would you think it terribly common

16:25.720 --> 16:28.270
- if I gave you my card?
- Fairly common.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.310
But I'll take it anyway.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.950
Telephone me. We'll have lunch or a drink.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Or something.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.710
Do you know, I couldn't
be less interested in cars

16:41.760 --> 16:43.750
if I took a pill to achieve it.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.300
Well, that's because you
haven't been taught about them.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.030
Properly.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.430
The main thing I want to avoid is
Granny being kicked off the board

16:53.480 --> 16:56.150
- of the new arrangement.
- We'll all be kicked off

16:56.200 --> 16:59.470
- with the fuss we're making.
- Supporting her wrong thinking won't help.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.670
Can I put in a word for
trying to remain friends?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.270
Tom the peacemaker is back.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.710
- (LAUGHS)
- That's really the purpose of it --

17:06.760 --> 17:09.869
Aunt Prudence. We're
outstaying our welcome.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.470
- Indeed. Goodnight, Robert.
- Goodnight.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.630
- Goodnight, Mary.
- Goodnight. Mr Talbot.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.680
Lady Mary.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.109
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

17:23.160 --> 17:25.150
Not that pain again?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.339
I can't drink port any more.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.160
Oh, darling...

17:32.760 --> 17:37.760
I don't think I've ever felt
such a lack... of reason.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What do you mean, reason?

17:42.080 --> 17:44.150
Why am I here? What am I doing?

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
What are we all doing?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.510
Trying to get through life as best we can.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.110
Yes, but you, you make friends.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.310
People like you. Her Ladyship likes you.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.310
Mr Molesley more than likes you.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.350
Don't be silly.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.600
It's true. I'm quite envious.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.750
Not of Mr Molesley, but the rest of it.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.790
And I envy you. You don't
care what people say.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.760
While I tremble at the mere
idea of public ridicule.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.870
I should be used to it by now, but...

18:18.920 --> 18:21.960
You are stronger than you think.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.990
And you're wrong about me.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
I mind what people say.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.030
It's no use talking as if you can
force me. We both know you can't.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.750
We can make you attend the trial.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.190
Come on. Sergeant Willis is not the enemy.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.910
Mr Coyle is the enemy
and here's your chance.

18:53.960 --> 18:58.150
Chance for what? Revenge?
Much good that will do.

18:58.200 --> 19:02.110
Not for revenge. To stop other girls
being tricked into a life of crime.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.950
Two of the women he
used are prostitutes now.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.480
At least one is dead. Do
you want him to go on?

19:10.240 --> 19:13.080
If I say yes, what happens next?

19:14.760 --> 19:17.790
We send a list of witnesses
to the prosecution.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.270
It's not a Penny Dreadful
with confessions from the box.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.390
They see who will testify on our side.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.520
If he won't change his plea,
he'll go to the trial.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.040
- Very well.
- Thank you, Miss Baxter.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.020
I'll keep you informed at every step.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.070
What changed your mind?

19:42.120 --> 19:44.350
The thought of the girls he ruined.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.390
Like he ruined me.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.710
Oh, but he hasn't ruined you, has he?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.470
And the proof is you're standing here.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
Maybe.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.160
But he changed me.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.750
I've just seen the Hardings' car.
We'll be in the drawing room.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.800
Certainly, m'lady.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.390
- Hello.
- I believe we're expected.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.710
Of course, Mr and Mrs Harding.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.350
Would you like to leave your coats?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.230
- Gwen?
- Anna?

20:45.280 --> 20:47.270
It is you, isn't it?

20:47.320 --> 20:49.590
Why didn't you telephone
and say you were coming?

20:49.640 --> 20:52.550
I didn't know we were until
this morning or I would have.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.750
He said we were visiting
somebody called Painswick.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.910
Lady Rosamund Painswick.
His Lordship's sister.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.960
I'd forgotten that.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.980
I'll see you later if I can.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.750
She hasn't got time to greet
her old friends, then.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.520
When were you a friend of Gwen's?

21:17.040 --> 21:20.270
We're so pleased to see you. I
want to hear all about Hillcroft.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.030
Why did you first get involved?

21:22.080 --> 21:24.950
Naturally I'd be happy to take
as much of the credit as possible,

21:25.000 --> 21:26.910
but it was really Mrs Harding's idea.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.350
What was it that drew you
to the work they were doing?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.390
Forgive me, but have we met?

21:31.440 --> 21:34.310
Er, I don't think we've met exactly.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.350
Tell us more about Hillcroft.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.070
You see, I never had any
higher education and so --

21:40.120 --> 21:43.350
Who did? All we were taught was
French prejudice and dance steps.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.750
(POLITE LAUGHTER)

21:44.800 --> 21:48.230
- Who's Gwen? - She was
housemaid here before the war.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.990
She got away to be a secretary.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.190
Now she's having lunch upstairs
while we're still stuck down here.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.950
- What does his Lordship think?
- They won't recognise her.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.630
- They don't look us in the face enough.
- I wonder if Karl Marx

21:58.680 --> 22:02.030
- might finish the liver pate (?)
- I don't think his Lordship will mind.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.430
He's not uncomfortable
about that sort of thing.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.670
It won't bother him that
she used to work here.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.390
Well, his daughter ran off with
a chauffeur in the interim.

22:09.440 --> 22:13.870
And Mrs Harding was a supporter
when Hillcroft first opened in 1920.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.350
Then later they needed a
treasurer, so she suggested me.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.510
And how do you manage from Yorkshire?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.790
It's not hard. I go there twice a month.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.190
But the telephone's
really changed everything.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.710
I want to hear Mrs Harding's story.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.430
It was the telephone that
changed everything for me, too.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.830
You see, I was a secretary
before I was married

22:34.880 --> 22:38.750
for a telephone company back when
everyone was getting connected

22:38.800 --> 22:41.590
- at the start of the war.
- Then she moved into local government

22:41.640 --> 22:43.230
and that's where we met.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.790
But if I'd had more education,
I might have gone further.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.110
If that doesn't sound too vain.

22:49.160 --> 22:53.110
No. Many women from all backgrounds
feel that. I know I did.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.430
I was a nurse, but why
couldn't I be a doctor?

22:55.480 --> 22:58.350
- Barrow, is that luncheon?
- It is, m'lady.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.710
- Shall we go in? - I hope we'll have
a chance to continue this conversation.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.760
(MURMURED CONVERSATIONS)

23:05.240 --> 23:07.830
- Look at you.
- I don't mean to pretend.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.830
I didn't know we were coming to Downton

23:09.880 --> 23:12.910
- until we turned into the drive.
- Does he not know you worked here?

23:12.960 --> 23:15.670
He knows I was a housemaid,
so there's no pretence.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.470
But by the time we met
that was all in the past.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.520
I'm one to talk. I married
the boss's daughter.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.870
So is she going to come down?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.350
I don't know, she didn't say.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.030
No, she's too important to
speak to the likes of us.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.080
Take those up now.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.430
We have to find ladders to help
them achieve their potential.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.270
I do so agree.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.430
We can't afford to waste working women

23:43.480 --> 23:46.070
- by not educating them.
- It's lucky Carson isn't here.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.710
- (LAUGHTER)
- Carson?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.750
Our butler. He's a traditionalist.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.320
You recall Mr Carson, madam, surely?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.550
What do you mean, Barrow?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.070
- Mrs Harding used to work here.
- What?

24:00.120 --> 24:02.990
- She used to be a --
- Thank you, Mr Barrow.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
I can tell it.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.270
I used to be a housemaid here for
a couple of years before the war.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.390
Here? In this house?

24:16.440 --> 24:18.190
I knew I'd seen your face.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.230
Why didn't you say?

24:20.280 --> 24:23.150
I don't know. Well, I was going to.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.270
You had every opportunity.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.350
You can take the pudding and
Andy can carry the cream.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.110
How's it going?

24:33.160 --> 24:35.470
- Mr Barrow just landed her in it.
- Deliberately?

24:35.520 --> 24:37.950
He only told the table she
used to work here as a maid.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.630
I knew he'd do something like that.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.950
Of course. How could he resist?

24:43.920 --> 24:47.670
We've been hearing that you spoiled
Gwen's luncheon. Good work (!)

24:47.720 --> 24:49.630
I couldn't have known she was planning

24:49.680 --> 24:52.190
- to lie her way through it.
- That's not it though, is it?

24:52.240 --> 24:55.150
You resent her luck. You're jealous.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.910
Jealous? Why?

24:57.960 --> 25:01.670
Because I dedicated my life to service

25:01.720 --> 25:03.910
and I'm about to be thrown out on my ear

25:03.960 --> 25:07.070
when she scarpered first chance she got

25:07.120 --> 25:09.110
and now she's lunching in the dining room?

25:09.160 --> 25:11.750
Why would that make me jealous, Mr Bates?

25:11.800 --> 25:14.910
His Lordship won't like it,
your trying to wrongfoot her.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.590
Well, we'll see.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.030
I know Lady Mary didn't
like being made a fool of.

25:19.080 --> 25:23.390
Now in case I have to remind
you all again, I am the butler.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.440
So please get on.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.790
Seems marvellous to me you leave
service, go into government.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.030
Now you're married to a prominent man.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.350
- 20th century story.
- I agree. Welcome back.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.990
I just feel stupid for
not recognising you.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.430
Why should you? We never spoke.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.510
You worked here for two years
and we never spoke to you.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.950
- We're the ones in the wrong.
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.550
- It was a good job.
- But not good enough to stay.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.030
I didn't want to be in
service my whole life.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.350
- That's all. - So you found
an opportunity and took it.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.070
- Bravo.
- I didn't find it.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.710
Lady Sybil found it.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.750
Sybil helped you?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.790
Yes.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.830
She did everything.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.510
She looked out for the
jobs, lent me clothes,

26:11.560 --> 26:13.190
drove me to the interviews.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.830
One time I remember the horse went lame

26:15.880 --> 26:17.870
and we both got stuck in the mud.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.590
Oh, the talking we had
to do when we got back!

26:20.640 --> 26:24.710
I remember we were so worried. But
she never said a thing about you.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.750
It was our secret pact.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.950
And then one day she cornered the man

26:29.000 --> 26:30.790
who was installing the telephone here

26:30.840 --> 26:34.150
and er, that's how I got
my first job in business.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.630
She wouldn't let me enter the
library while you met him.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.670
So that was you?

26:39.720 --> 26:41.710
Did you keep in contact?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.240
Christmas cards and such.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.670
And then I heard the news.

26:49.600 --> 26:54.670
I'll never forget her. Her
kindness changed my life.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.120
What a lovely way to remember her.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
She was a lovely person.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
Darling Sybil.

27:04.320 --> 27:08.590
Thank you, Barrow, for reminding
us of Mrs Harding's time here.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.640
My pleasure, m'lady.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.960
They're coming now!

27:20.360 --> 27:22.230
I just wanted to come and say hello.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.870
Oh, Mrs Hughes will be sad to miss you.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.510
Now, tell us about your children.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.550
We want to know every detail.
Where are you living now?

27:30.600 --> 27:33.150
All right. Well, let's
begin at the beginning.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.350
But afterwards, I'd like
to hear all about you.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.590
Mr Branson, I wouldn't
bother you but now you're back

27:38.640 --> 27:41.230
- and now you're the agent again --
- Lady Mary's the agent.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.310
But still, you'll know what they're
planning for Yew Tree Farm.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.590
I suppose so.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.030
Only, Mr Mason was in the running for it

27:48.080 --> 27:50.230
but now it seems they've
had second thoughts.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.030
It's not quite as simple as that.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.070
Well, it's as simple as this.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.950
His son, my husband, left this
house to die for his country.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.470
Shouldn't we help him now if we can?

28:02.160 --> 28:04.160
I'll have a word.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.990
I've an idea that when you mentioned
Mrs Harding's connection with us

28:10.040 --> 28:11.670
you were trying to catch her out.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.510
- Well, I -- - I don't like
to see such things, Barrow.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.310
I don't care for a lack of
generosity. Do you understand me?

28:17.360 --> 28:19.360
Yes, m'lord.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.070
You are your own worst enemy.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.390
If I am, I've got competition.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.990
Mrs Harding rather put me in
my place when she was here.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.510
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.990
No. But when she was
talking about Lady Sybil

28:40.040 --> 28:42.510
I had one of those moments
where you look at your life

28:42.560 --> 28:45.030
and I realised how much
better Sybil was than I am.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.990
- It was quite chastening.
- You're hard on yourself, m'lady.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.150
Why did I have to be so pettish?
She'd made something of her life,

28:51.200 --> 28:53.190
- why shouldn't she?
- (GROANS)

28:53.240 --> 28:55.230
(GASPING)

28:55.280 --> 28:57.680
Now, don't panic. Are you in pain?

28:59.320 --> 29:02.470
I was then. A sharp pain.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.520
I had it earlier.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.870
I'm losing it. It's happening again.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.590
We don't know that. Right,
we're going up to London.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.790
I'll ring Dr Ryder, there'll
be a night telephone line.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.830
But we've missed the last train.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.790
We'll drive into York.
There may be a late train.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.470
What do I tell Mr Bates? I
don't want to frighten him,

29:21.520 --> 29:23.270
but I mustn't get his hopes up.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.990
Tell him it's me, I need to
see a doctor double-quick.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.350
What if I lose it on the way?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.510
Then we'll be no worse
off than we are now.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.150
But we'll make him see
you when we get there.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.950
I don't care what time it is,
he'll come to Belgrave Square.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.440
Now go, and meet me at the front.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.830
- Why the suitcase?
- I'm racing up to London.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.870
Whatever for? What's happened?

29:48.920 --> 29:52.390
Don't tell anyone, but it's Anna.
She may be having a miscarriage.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.030
How will you get there?

29:54.080 --> 29:55.870
We've missed the last train from here

29:55.920 --> 29:58.150
but if we drive into York
there may be a late one.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.030
- If not, we'll get the milk train at dawn.
- I'll take you to York.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.630
Remember, not a word to
anyone. Not even Bates.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.950
She should tell him. But
anyway, I'll get the car.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.990
Can I stay in Belgrave Square?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.670
Of course. I'll telephone Mead.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.590
- Haven't you missed the last train?
- Tom's driving us into York.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.750
- Us?
- Anna.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.830
- May we ask why?
- Something medical.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.830
- Oh my lord. - I'm not in any
danger, but I need to go now.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.270
I'll be back in a day or two.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.350
- But what time will you get there?
- I'll get there when I get there.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.390
Goodbye. I'll telephone tomorrow.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.150
Carson and Mrs Hu -- Mrs
Carson will be back on Friday.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.550
- It'd be nice if you were
to welcome them. - I'll try.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.600
That's it, I must fly.

30:36.440 --> 30:40.520
I don't understand the urgency.
Lady Mary didn't seem ill earlier.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.990
- Do you want her medical history?
- No, but it seems so sudden.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.440
Sometimes these things are sudden.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.750
- So you're not hiding anything?
- (SIGHS)

30:50.800 --> 30:53.710
You've lived with suspicion too
long. It's got under your skin.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.350
I should get in. I mustn't
keep Mr Branson waiting.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.140
- Before her Ladyship?
- Here she is now.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.670
Good evening, Bates.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.660
Don't worry, we'll be
back before you know it.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.150
What's Lady Mary's emergency?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.790
- It's none of our business.
- Very true, Miss Baxter.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.910
For once I agree with you.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.670
Daisy, what is it?

31:32.720 --> 31:36.550
I've had enough. I don't
care what Mrs Patmore says.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.430
Her Ladyship has cheated
Mr Mason of his farm

31:40.480 --> 31:42.790
- and I'm going to have it out with her.
- Daisy, don't.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.750
You'll lose your job and then what?

31:44.800 --> 31:49.430
Look at Gwen. She's thrown off the
yoke of service to make a good life.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.470
What am I doing with my mine?

31:51.520 --> 31:54.030
- Why aren't you two up there now?
- They wanted to be alone.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.950
We gave them coffee and they sent us off.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.880
- You can't go barging in when they're
discussing something private. - I'll wait for
her.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.880
I wish you wouldn't.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.870
Poor Tom, racing across the county.
It's just Mary being dramatic.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.150
She didn't look at all ill.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.950
Well, why else would she have gone?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.990
We'll ask her tomorrow morning.

32:14.040 --> 32:18.270
I'd like to take advantage of her
absence to settle Yew Tree Farm.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.430
I want to offer it to Mr Mason.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.470
I know you do. But he's quite old.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.350
- He'll have Daisy to help him.
- Can we afford it?

32:26.400 --> 32:29.830
We'd make more money if we farmed
it ourselves and let the house.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.310
Shouldn't we wait for Tom to
get back before we decide?

32:32.360 --> 32:35.560
- I'll ask him what Sybil would do?
- Is that fair?

32:36.240 --> 32:38.150
Daisy, I beg of you.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.630
You're a trained cook, you
could get work anywhere.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.350
But you'll have to manage without
a reference if you do this!

32:43.400 --> 32:45.990
She's right, Daisy. Have
you forgotten what happened

32:46.040 --> 32:49.070
- when you let off steam at the auction?
- No. I've had it up to here.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.110
I've come to the end. I must do it.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.790
Well, I'm coming with you.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.150
- Please yourself. I'm going.
- Why? It won't help Mr Mason.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.390
Listen to him, Daisy. Listen to
him, if you won't listen to me!

33:00.440 --> 33:02.910
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.110
You're back. You made good time.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.510
We made the last train so
they're on their way south.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.150
I wish I knew what it was about.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.310
- Nothing to concern you, I promise.
- You missed a jolly good dinner.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.150
I bought some sandwiches at the
station and ate them in the car.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.350
You're a braver man than I am, Gunga Din.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.870
We've been settling some
business while you were away.

33:19.920 --> 33:23.470
- Oh? Yes? - Mama wants Mr
Mason to have Yew Tree Farm.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.870
I see.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.070
Of course, it's not a
business-like decision

33:27.120 --> 33:29.830
and Cora has been using some
emotional blackmail on us.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.310
I asked them what they felt
Sybil would want us to do.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.110
Well, we all know the answer to that.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.590
But is it enough to convince you?

33:35.640 --> 33:37.710
I was reminded recently
of William's death.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.350
And I suppose I do feel
old Mason's in our charge.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.150
That's what I say.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.270
- Shouldn't we wait for Mary?
- No. I'll handle Mary.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.350
It'd be better if it's a fait accompli.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.870
We don't have to do everything Mary
says. Not when we're all agreed.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.720
Maybe it's underhand
to go behind her back.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.760
But it's much too important to
me to let scruples get in the way.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.910
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.720
- Your Ladyship.
- Daisy?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.389
Yes, it's me. And I have to speak to you.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.429
- Daisy...
- What are you doing here, Baxter?

34:13.480 --> 34:16.429
I was a little worried about Daisy,
m'lady. She's been very upset.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.590
- I have been upset.
- I'm sorry to hear it,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.909
but I don't understand
what you're doing here.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.230
Daisy, there you are. That was quick.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.750
Will you tell Mr Mason
the news or should we?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.790
Tell him what?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.989
He's got the farm if he still wants it.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.750
Isn't that why you're here?

34:31.800 --> 34:34.560
What wonderful news. Daisy...

34:36.560 --> 34:37.870
Wonderful.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.000
She's going downstairs now, m'lady,
and I'll see you in your room.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.110
That was rather peculiar.

34:48.159 --> 34:51.360
I have a feeling I've just dodged
something and I don't know what.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.870
(SIGHS)

34:55.920 --> 34:57.910
(GROANS)

34:57.960 --> 34:59.960
Don't start.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
(BIRDSONG)

35:19.760 --> 35:22.310
- How is she?
- Resting.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.350
Sleeping, I hope by now.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.390
- Has she lost the baby?
- No.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.430
We got there in time.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.030
I've put in the stitch I spoke of
and as they say in medical novels,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.440
I'm cautiously optimistic.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.870
- And what shall I do now?
- Can you stay a day or two?

35:38.920 --> 35:40.750
We could go back on Friday.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.030
Good. Make her rest when she gets there

35:43.080 --> 35:45.070
but don't fret too much.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.710
I'm so grateful to you for
coming out here at dawn.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.710
Don't worry. It'll be
reflected in my bill.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.430
- Of course.
- And now I'll say goodbye.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.630
I feel so... I don't know, dazed.

36:02.680 --> 36:07.270
Yesterday I thought I hated her
and today she saved our lives.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.070
It never does good to hate anyone.

36:10.120 --> 36:14.310
So is this true? Your Mr Mason got
the farm after everything you said?

36:14.360 --> 36:16.670
- Seems like it.
- I envy him.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.190
Ooh, high praise from a city boy.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.750
Not me. Country life is what I'm after.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.600
I don't care where I started,
this is where I want to end up.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.750
When will Carson get here tomorrow?

36:35.800 --> 36:37.750
6:00, m'lord, if the train's on time.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.430
Is anything planned as a welcome?

36:39.480 --> 36:42.350
We're having a bit of a do in
the servants' hall to say hello.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.470
Well, we'll come down.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.990
And please tell Mrs Patmore
we can have a cold dinner

36:46.040 --> 36:48.070
- if that would be easier.
- Very good, m'lord.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.880
- Back to normal at last!
- I've enjoyed my time as butler.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.270
I hope you've learned something from it.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.470
You see, Barrow, Carson is a kind man.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.920
Don't overlook that. It's
why people are loyal to him.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.790
I'll bear it in mind, m'lord.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.760
Do. It should be helpful when you
-- That is, when the hour strikes.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.640
To move on. Yes, m'lord.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.470
Welcome to the Royal Automobile Club.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.110
Do you know it?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.440
No, but I like to be surprised.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.190
I'm sorry if I look rather shabby.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.990
I didn't bring any clothes, so
I've stolen this from my aunt.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.040
Hm.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.430
You are the opposite of shabby.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.160
(BAND PLAYS RAGTIME JAZZ)

38:03.480 --> 38:05.830
I can't think why, but I've
never been here before.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.870
When was it built?

38:07.920 --> 38:09.910
1911.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.550
The temple of car lovers.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.510
Your love is not fickle, I'll admit.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.150
But I'm afraid for me, a car
is simply to get from A to B.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.190
Nothing more.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.030
What is your enthusiasm? Horses?

38:25.080 --> 38:30.230
No. I ride, I even hunt, but I
don't see horses in my dreams.

38:30.280 --> 38:34.790
- What then?
- I like my work.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.830
Do you work?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.150
It's rather shocking, isn't it?

38:40.720 --> 38:43.030
My father and I co-own the estate.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.150
But I really function as the agent.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.470
So many estates are going under these days

38:47.520 --> 38:50.150
and I'm just determined that
Downton won't be one of them.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.680
Far from shocked, I am
extremely impressed.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.390
- And you have a son?
- Yes. George.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.310
He'll take over eventually, I assume,

39:01.360 --> 39:03.550
and when he does, I want to make sure

39:03.600 --> 39:05.710
he's the master of a modern going concern.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.550
He's also heir to his grandfather's title

39:08.600 --> 39:10.670
for reasons too complicated
to bore you with.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.320
So it's very neat and tidy.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.350
Neat and tidy-ish.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.940
But aren't you rather at a loose end?

39:20.040 --> 39:23.110
I hope this means you're boiling
up to make a pass before we're done.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.150
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:25.200 --> 39:27.190
Probably.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.230
But will you accept?

39:29.280 --> 39:33.520
No. But I shall enjoy
the process enormously.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.230
I can't believe it. I feel like I'm
standing at the gates of paradise.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.150
I don't think it's any
nicer than your old farm.

39:48.200 --> 39:52.430
But it's safe, Daisy. They'll not
sell this estate in my lifetime.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.470
Lady Mary wouldn't allow it.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.070
So I know now where I can lay my bones.

39:57.120 --> 40:01.190
And it's down to you. You've
used your credit to rescue me.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.390
I don't think I have got much credit.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.870
Well, that's where you're wrong.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.060
And here's the proof of it.

40:15.240 --> 40:19.110
- They'll be here in a minute.
- Is that straight?

40:19.160 --> 40:20.670
Down a bit on the left.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.270
We're not striving for
a setting by Diaghilev.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.720
The point is we've made an effort.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.670
- Are you finished? - I've unpacked
and then they're changing tonight

40:32.720 --> 40:34.710
so they can come down and say hello.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.470
- And the trip went well?
- I think so, yes.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.520
Why?

40:40.920 --> 40:43.790
Because I believe I
know what you're hiding.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.040
And I feel sure I know what it is
that took you to London in a rush.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.240
And I hope I'm wrong.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.350
You're not wrong in all of it.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.910
But you're wrong if you think
I'm hiding something sad.

40:56.960 --> 41:00.560
What I've been hiding is very, very happy.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
Oh, God...

41:05.680 --> 41:07.680
Are you sure?

41:08.680 --> 41:10.550
- Really?
- Really.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.670
MRS PATMORE: They're here!

41:14.280 --> 41:16.280
ALL: Aw!

41:18.240 --> 41:22.030
Home again at last. I feel
I've been away for months.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.590
Very flattering, I don't think!

41:24.640 --> 41:27.440
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh, thank you.

41:28.760 --> 41:32.990
Oh, there you all are. Plotting!

41:33.040 --> 41:34.470
You're the one who's plotting.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.470
Is it really so important to keep
the Crawleys in command, Mama?

41:38.520 --> 41:41.310
That is my sole motive, is it?

41:41.360 --> 41:45.110
- Isn't it?
- No. No, it is not.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.550
For years, I've watched governments
take control of our lives.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.110
And their argument is always the same --

41:53.160 --> 41:55.670
fewer costs, greater efficiency.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.870
But the result is the same, too --

41:57.920 --> 42:01.110
less control by the people,
more control by the state.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.110
Until the individual's own
wishes count for nothing.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.110
That is what I consider my duty to resist.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.310
By wielding your unelected power?

42:10.360 --> 42:13.950
You see, the point of a
so-called 'great family'

42:14.000 --> 42:16.470
is to protect our freedoms.

42:16.520 --> 42:20.430
That is why the barons made
King John sign the Magna Carta.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.790
I do see that your argument was
more honourable than I'd appreciated.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.510
But, Mama, we're not living in 1215.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.350
And the strengths of great
families like ours is going,

42:29.400 --> 42:32.230
- that's just fact.
- Your great-grandchildren won't thank you

42:32.280 --> 42:35.190
when the state is all-powerful
because we didn't fight.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.510
Well, I won't have any,
so I can live with that.

42:37.560 --> 42:41.600
They've arrived, so we should go
down as soon as Mary gets here.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.270
Have you told her about Mr Mason?

42:44.320 --> 42:46.190
- I have.
- How'd she take it?

42:46.240 --> 42:48.350
She's annoyed. But it
seems London went well

42:48.400 --> 42:51.310
- so she's less cross than she might be.
- Good of you to come, Isobel.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.510
We couldn't miss Carson's return.
And Mrs... Carson, of course.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.910
- (LAUGHTER)
- I can't get my tongue round it.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.950
We've simply got to learn.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
We ought to go down. I could hear
them shouting from my bedroom.

43:05.880 --> 43:10.120
I haven't been into the
kitchens for at least 20 years.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.660
Have you got your passport?

43:15.280 --> 43:17.950
Make sure his Lordship has a drink, Andy.

43:19.480 --> 43:22.030
- Hello, Molesley.
- Has it changed much since your day?

43:22.080 --> 43:26.520
I only know I shall need Ariande's
thread to find my way out.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.190
When are you going to
appoint your new editor?

43:30.240 --> 43:31.350
Why can't it be you?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.950
Well, I'd like to be a sort of co-editor,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.590
but no man will put up with that so
I'm going to try and find a woman.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.350
A woman editor? I applaud you.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.390
Of course you do.

43:43.440 --> 43:48.030
Presumably we may now look
forward to women field marshals

43:48.080 --> 43:49.990
and a woman pope!

43:50.040 --> 43:52.230
Nonsense, Granny. I
think it's a good idea.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.270
It is a magazine for women.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.080
Well, we should congratulate them.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.790
That was nice of you,
to praise Edith's plan.

44:04.840 --> 44:08.640
A monkey will type out the Bible
if you leave it long enough.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.430
Carson, Mrs Carson.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.590
I'm so sorry I missed the wedding but
I'm delighted to be here tonight.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.070
Thank you.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.710
(QUIETLY) "Mrs Carson..."

44:17.760 --> 44:20.310
It's like Jane Eyre asking
to be called Mrs Rochester.

44:20.360 --> 44:23.360
- I'll never get used to it.
- None of us will.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.110
When will the trial be?

44:26.160 --> 44:29.030
I don't know yet. No doubt I'll
find out when the time comes.

44:29.080 --> 44:31.070
At least he can't hurt you now.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.110
Can't he?

44:33.160 --> 44:36.710
Mama's slipped away. She was
tired, so I told her to go.

44:36.760 --> 44:40.110
- Quite right. - I'm afraid she
won't give up. About the hospital.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.390
I shan't think that at her funeral.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.430
Who says she won't be at yours?

44:44.480 --> 44:47.040
Oh, thank you.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.190
- Thank you.
- Anything to report, Mr Barrow?

44:51.240 --> 44:54.950
Only that being a butler is more
complicated than I'd realised.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.790
If you've learnt that,
you've used your time well.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.550
Your cottage is ready and your
things have been taken there.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.750
That's very considerate,
m'lady. Thank you.

45:02.800 --> 45:06.470
You must let us know if anything
needs to be done, Mrs... Mrs Carson.

45:06.520 --> 45:09.190
Well, now, m'lord, this is the thing.

45:09.240 --> 45:13.990
Won't it be confusing if we're to
be called Carson and Mrs Carson?

45:14.040 --> 45:17.710
Rather as we resisted
Anna being Mrs Bates,

45:17.760 --> 45:19.390
would it be very irregular

45:19.440 --> 45:23.430
if we continued to be
Carson and Mrs Hughes?

45:23.480 --> 45:26.550
Oh, hallelujah! You've
made me a happy man.

45:26.600 --> 45:30.830
Let us raise a glass and drink
the health of the newly-weds.

45:30.880 --> 45:34.710
Still to be known in this house at
any rate as Carson and Mrs Hughes.

45:34.760 --> 45:37.270
ALL: Carson and Mrs Hughes.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.310
Good heavens, there really is a God.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.310
- What a relief.
- To no-one more than his Lordship.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.350
(LAUGHS)

45:44.400 --> 45:49.230
I just want to go and check my room.
Make sure they've taken everything.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.280
Right you are.

46:33.600 --> 46:36.590
The Minister of Health
is paying us a visit.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.710
- Mr Chamberlain?
- So now that you've settled in

46:38.760 --> 46:40.790
have you decided what
your next task will be?

46:40.840 --> 46:43.510
- Good day to you. - A wonder
you've got the nerve to speak to me.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.510
- Edith has a date.
- No, I don't.

46:45.560 --> 46:49.110
