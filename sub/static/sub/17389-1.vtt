01:03.560 --> 01:07.360
My husband used to tell me
I have an overactive imagination.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.566
I can't help it.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.200
I mean, haven't you ever been on a train

01:12.280 --> 01:15.011
and wondered about the lives of
the people who live near the tracks?

01:15.600 --> 01:18.126
The lives you've never lived.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.891
These are things I want to know.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.680
Twice a day,
I sit in the third car from the front

01:26.760 --> 01:30.003
where I have the perfect view
into my favorite house.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.850
Number 15 Beckett Road.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.760
I don't know when exactly.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.526
I suppose
I started noticing her about a year ago,

01:46.960 --> 01:49.042
and gradually, as the months went past,

01:49.920 --> 01:52.321
she became important to me.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.441
I'm not the girl I used to be.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.449
I think people can see it on my face.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.370
She's what I lost.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.521
She's everything I want to be.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.688
I imagine she's a painter.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.285
She's creative.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.327
He is a doctor or an architect.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.804
He has a good laugh.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.085
She can't cook.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.490
I wonder what they say to
each other before they go to sleep.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.400
Today, her name is Jess.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.802
Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.164
It all depends on the day.
It depends on my mood.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.931
The truth is, I don't know her name.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.568
I don't know if she paints
or whether he has a good laugh.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.009
I just know they know love.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.680
Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember

04:18.760 --> 04:22.125
the last time I had meaningful contact
with another person.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.687
I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett Road.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.640
No!

04:36.720 --> 04:38.688
It was my first home.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.440
We bought it together. It was ours.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.326
Every day I tell myself not to look.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.723
But then I look.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.841
Are you alone?

05:05.120 --> 05:07.885
Yeah. No. Come. It's all yours.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.280
Okay.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.320
- Your baby's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.447
Hi, baby!

05:14.560 --> 05:15.760
Is it a boy?

05:15.840 --> 05:16.841
Yeah!

05:17.680 --> 05:19.880
So sweet! How old is he?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.920
- Six months.
- Six months.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.090
So sweet.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.121
Shh.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.840
A teacher once told me
I was a mistress of self-reinvention.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.529
I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.051
But since moving here,
I've come to understand it.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.411
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.961
It's a fucking baby factory.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.201
I wanna start my life over again.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.411
So far, I've been a rebellious teenager,

06:47.320 --> 06:48.481
lover,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.010
waitress,

06:51.360 --> 06:53.328
gallery director,

06:54.920 --> 06:56.081
nanny,

06:58.400 --> 07:01.210
and a whore.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.167
And not necessarily in that order.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.931
I can't just be a wife anymore.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.526
That's why I stay awake at night,
staring at the ceiling.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.886
In fact, the only time I feel
like myself is when I'm running.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.046
You always felt that way?

07:33.200 --> 07:36.602
Maybe since I was about 17.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.804
- Hmm.
- With Mac.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.721
Mac?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.605
Who's Mac?

07:43.280 --> 07:45.282
My brother's best friend.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.209
My brother who died.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.166
I tend to smile when I'm nervous.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.242
Sometimes I laugh.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.286
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.444
We started fucking.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.841
We were the saddest people we knew.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.851
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.729
No one could find us.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.360
Everyone thought we were dead.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.159
And if you were to run away today,

08:42.240 --> 08:44.447
right now, where would you go?

08:56.400 --> 09:00.051
I read once that when a train hits,
it can rip the clothes right off of you.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.000
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job

09:12.080 --> 09:14.003
is gonna make me less restless.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.162
Make me wanna get pregnant.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.603
And that's not the case?

09:21.440 --> 09:24.680
When I finish work every night,
I run home and I get in the shower,

09:24.760 --> 09:28.162
and I wash the smell of that baby
off of me as fast as I can.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.841
Ah.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.920
When you woke up this morning,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.049
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.920
And when I was feeding you,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.288
we heard Daddy singing
from the kitchen, didn't we?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.167
Happy birthday to you

09:55.520 --> 09:57.249
Happy birthday to you

09:58.680 --> 10:01.920
Happy birthday, dear Anna

10:02.000 --> 10:04.480
Happy birthday to you

10:05.200 --> 10:08.440
Oh. Daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

10:08.520 --> 10:10.761
that he made for Mommy, didn't he?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.291
Yes, he did.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.367
Thank you, Megan.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.410
There you go.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.328
Shh, shh, shh.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.761
Ooh, hello.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.960
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.880
I mean, look at her. Look at her!

10:43.240 --> 10:45.240
You're not sleeping!

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
Hello?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.686
You're not sleeping.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.401
Hello?

10:51.520 --> 10:52.681
Hello?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.931
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.046
And grab the corners.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.361
And straight.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.410
I got another job.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.761
You what?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.691
I'm really sorry, Anna.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.040
I thought you were happy here.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.880
I mean, you seemed happy here.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.610
I am.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.762
It's just this isn't what I do.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.011
Take care of children?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.121
Or laundry.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.048
Another gallery headhunted me.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.360
That's great.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.602
The thing is, it starts tomorrow.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.360
I'm out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.522
I hate to leave you
like this without childcare,

11:45.640 --> 11:47.290
but you don't have a job.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.482
Okay, that sounded wrong.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.600
I know that you're busy volunteering.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.880
It's not the volunteering.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.880
It's all the shopping, it's spending
hours in the farmers' market,

12:01.960 --> 12:04.880
it's finding the right foods for her,
it's pureeing sweet potatoes,

12:04.960 --> 12:09.051
and I do all of this
at the same time as I'm nursing.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.729
Maybe you should go back to work, too.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.720
Mothers need to work.
It's actually better for the kid.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.404
And how would you know?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.160
Your key.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.610
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.010
Megan, please.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.600
Rachel!

12:59.680 --> 13:02.047
What are you doing? Give me my baby.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.285
Rachel, what are you doing?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.489
Hello?

13:20.120 --> 13:21.485
Thank you.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.565
Hmm. Beautiful.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.400
How many times has she texted you today?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.240
I don't know.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.448
She called the landline three times.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.281
Oh.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.600
You have to talk to her.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.640
I know.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.801
It's getting crazy.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.570
I will. I know, I know, I know.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.600
Okay.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.806
It's gonna be fine.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.680
Isn't it always fine?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.280
Don't I always make everything fine?

13:49.360 --> 13:50.725
Stop!

13:52.440 --> 13:54.320
Who gives a shit? It's your birthday.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.160
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you out tonight?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.200
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.964
Ask her to come back.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.480
She just quit.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.000
She what?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.844
She just told me she got another job.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.561
Huh.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
Shame.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.363
I thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.241
Mmm.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.966
So did I.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.800
Hey, it's Tom. Sorry I missed you.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.291
I'll get right back to you.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.320
Hey, Tom. It's me.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.120
Uh, I just wanted to wish
Momma a happy birthday.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.725
- Happy birthday, Mom...
- Rachel!

16:01.040 --> 16:02.326
Jesus.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
No, no, no.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.760
- No, don't, Cathy. Please stop it.
- Relax.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.840
- Cathy, come on!
- Relax!

16:08.920 --> 16:11.080
I just need some to go
to sleep, that's all.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.084
I just need a little bit to go to sleep.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.611
What brought this on?

16:18.920 --> 16:22.120
He posted another picture of the baby.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.440
It was a cute picture.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.931
- Yeah?
- Yup.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.407
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.600
I got it. I got it.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.848
All right. Let's get you to your room.

16:39.200 --> 16:43.091
Rachel, you have to
stop calling them, okay?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.321
I really appreciate this room.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.484
I do.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.040
I thought that I would just be here

16:54.120 --> 16:57.960
for a couple of weeks or months.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.565
Yeah, that was two years ago.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.605
Get some sleep.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.961
IVF rarely works the first time.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.645
Would you like a moment?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.323
It's okay, sweetie.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.080
We're gonna try again.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.481
We can't afford to do it again.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.604
When we can, we will.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.880
I wonder what she's looking at.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.611
Or if she even sees this train at all.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.401
Who is that man?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.124
What is she doing?

19:58.880 --> 20:00.609
She's throwing it all away.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.000
Anna, I fell asleep
last night thinking of you.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.400
I dreamed about kissing
the inside of your thighs

20:38.480 --> 20:40.560
and holding your breasts.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.768
God, I wish I was fucking you right now.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.568
Anna, I love you.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.603
I love you so much.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.410
When it happened to me,
I found dozens of e-mails.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.920
Tom told her that he'd never
felt like this before.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.447
He said it wouldn't be that
much longer until they were together.

21:02.960 --> 21:06.521
I know what they say.
You shouldn't check his e-mail.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.210
I was stupid.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.200
But when I, um...

21:12.280 --> 21:17.200
When I saw it was from the realtor,
I thought that it was just spam.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.800
And then I realized
that they were kisses, not X's.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.200
And my husband was fucking
a Century 21 agent.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.680
- That sucks.
- It does.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.650
Her name was Anna Boyd
and he was in love with her.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.284
Come here for one second.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.640
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.564
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

21:42.240 --> 21:44.811
That bitch is living in my house.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.840
I picked everything in that house.
I picked everything.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.560
I picked the dining table,
the kitchen table.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.760
I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom

21:53.840 --> 21:56.800
on the same table that her baby eats at.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.769
I just wanna tell her.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.160
I wish I could tell her.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.280
I picked everything in that house.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.408
I fucking picked everything in that house.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.160
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

22:17.240 --> 22:20.040
when I read that e-mail.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.520
But this morning, I did.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.965
I did.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.926
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else, just...

22:32.280 --> 22:35.680
Betraying her husband, I felt...

22:35.760 --> 22:37.080
I felt it.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.164
I felt pure rage.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.807
It was like something had been
taken from me again.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.040
If I could...

22:49.120 --> 22:52.044
If I could, I'd just go to her house,

22:52.960 --> 22:57.240
and I'd go and find her
sitting at the kitchen table,

22:57.320 --> 22:58.680
and I'd just...

22:58.760 --> 23:01.286
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair

23:01.400 --> 23:02.760
and I'd jerk her head back.

23:02.840 --> 23:07.560
I'd just jerk it back, and then
I'd pull her down to the ground,

23:07.640 --> 23:13.488
and I would just smash
her head all over the floor!

24:09.040 --> 24:10.960
Move! Get out of my way!

24:11.040 --> 24:12.041
Move!

25:06.080 --> 25:07.161
Hey!

25:08.680 --> 25:09.681
Hey!

25:21.880 --> 25:23.120
You whore!

25:56.920 --> 25:58.570
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.643
What the hell is wrong with you?

26:02.200 --> 26:04.806
I spent the past hour
driving around looking for you.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.080
You scared the shit out of Anna.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.207
Do you know that?

26:11.160 --> 26:13.162
She thought you were gonna...

26:13.840 --> 26:16.002
She wanted to call the police. So just...

26:19.720 --> 26:21.484
Leave us alone.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.120
You can ruin your own life if you want to,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.760
but you're not gonna destroy ours.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.286
I'm not gonna protect you anymore.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.926
Oh, my God.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.808
Rachel? Open the door.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.800
Cathy, I just need a sec.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.440
Are you okay?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.409
Rachel, open the door.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.320
I have a stomach flu.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.320
- Okay? I just...
- You don't have a flu.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.800
What the fuck, Rachel?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.041
I'm not stupid!

27:12.400 --> 27:14.323
- Rachel!
- Cathy, just go away!

27:25.080 --> 27:27.401
Come here for one second. Just one second.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.000
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."

27:30.080 --> 27:32.287
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

27:39.120 --> 27:40.360
You whore!

28:25.520 --> 28:26.600
No!

28:43.400 --> 28:47.928
Anyone counting days 1 to 90,
who would like to share a day count?

28:48.080 --> 28:49.760
- Hey, I'm Jason. I'm an alcoholic.
- Welcome, Jason.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.524
I've got 22 days back.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.206
Anyone else?

29:03.520 --> 29:05.682
Hi. I'm Rachel and...

29:06.400 --> 29:08.004
- Welcome, Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.165
Thank you. This is day one, I suppose.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.201
Um...

29:28.520 --> 29:30.682
I'm here because I...

29:32.120 --> 29:33.531
Because I...

29:35.360 --> 29:38.603
Because I woke up, um, covered in blood.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.450
And I had bruises all over my arm, um...

29:46.200 --> 29:49.522
It's usually from when I've fallen
and someone's helped me up.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.325
My husband...

29:55.200 --> 29:58.602
He used to tell me
what I'd done the night before.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.881
And I learned when you wake up
like that, you just say you're sorry.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.967
You just say you're sorry
for what you did,

30:12.080 --> 30:14.320
and you're sorry for who you are,

30:14.400 --> 30:16.640
and you're never gonna do it again.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.961
But you do. You do it again.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.847
And there's time missing.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.529
I need to remember.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.489
I need to remember.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.080
Okay. Thank you, Rachel.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.161
Thank you, Rachel.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.080
Right? It was that, um...

30:53.160 --> 30:54.480
The homeless thing.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.971
I don't remember what it was called.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.240
Oh, Safe Shelter.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.040
That was a tube top, right?

30:59.120 --> 31:00.451
Yep, it was.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.880
Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.200
"And I can't wait
because it's fun to dress up."

31:06.280 --> 31:07.360
Then dress up.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.560
Do you like devil's eggs, Martha?

31:08.640 --> 31:10.563
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.680
Deviled eggs.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.921
Thank you for making them.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.160
The classics. Do you wanna
try one, anybody?

31:17.240 --> 31:19.120
Those go outside.
I don't want the eggs with the dessert.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.560
So do you wanna put them here?
Do you want them with your hot dogs?

31:23.640 --> 31:25.920
Or you can put a couple
with your quinoa if you want to.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.923
Do you wanna put them
with your other salad and your corn?

31:28.040 --> 31:29.565
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall...

31:29.760 --> 31:30.807
Rachel!

31:31.280 --> 31:33.600
I'm fine, Tom! Stop it.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.520
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.320
You never have my back.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.480
That's my boss's wife.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.891
Probably got me fired back there.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.960
I don't give a fuck. I'm your wife.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.769
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.240
You never fucking support me.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.600
Rachel, please stop it!

31:47.680 --> 31:49.967
Hey, come on! I need you to focus here.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.242
- Don't fucking talk to me like that!
- Relax!

32:07.600 --> 32:09.120
- Rachel. There you are.
- Cathy, I'm sorry.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.725
I need to get my shit together.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.251
You must be Ms. Watson.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.930
I'm Detective Riley.
This is Detective Gaskill.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.800
We need to ask you a few questions.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.644
What's this about?

32:22.160 --> 32:23.571
Wanna sit down?

32:28.080 --> 32:31.482
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

32:35.400 --> 32:39.371
I was at work in the city, and then...

32:41.360 --> 32:43.640
And then I went to visit my husband.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.245
You mean your ex-husband?

32:47.200 --> 32:50.488
Yeah. So I got off the train
at Ardsley-on-Hudson,

32:52.840 --> 32:55.280
and then I decided that it was a bad idea.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.522
Around what time
did you reach that conclusion?

32:58.360 --> 33:00.249
I was back here by 11:00.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.124
Yeah. Yeah.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.322
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

33:08.400 --> 33:09.360
No.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.000
And what time did you
take the train there?

33:12.080 --> 33:13.320
Um, 6:00.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.160
So, what'd you do during
those hours in Ardsley,

33:17.240 --> 33:19.083
if you weren't seeing your ex-husband?

33:28.160 --> 33:30.720
Do you remember seeing this woman?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.560
She worked for your ex-husband.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.360
She's gone missing.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.760
What do you mean she's missing?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.760
Her husband said she never came back home

33:38.840 --> 33:41.764
the same night you got off the train
in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.120
I was just...

33:45.200 --> 33:47.200
- Do you know Megan Hipwell?
- No!

33:47.280 --> 33:49.920
- Did you see her?
- No, I don't think so.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.923
Is that because you were inebriated?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.880
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

33:55.960 --> 33:59.160
Are you referring to your job
in public relations?

33:59.240 --> 34:00.400
Right.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.040
It's my understanding you were fired
from that job over a year ago

34:03.120 --> 34:05.771
because of your drinking problem.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.041
Okay. That's enough for now.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.246
If you're able to remember
anything else, give us a call.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.050
Did you really get fired?

34:32.920 --> 34:35.040
Look, I didn't want you to worry
that I couldn't pay the rent.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.203
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.920
I ride the train.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.080
You what?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.925
I ride the train to New York and back.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.681
That's what your alimony's paying for?
Tickets to nowhere?

34:52.920 --> 34:55.080
That's really fucking weird, Rachel.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.525
Okay, okay.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.280
I got on the train,
and then I got off the train.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.720
I don't know. It's very unclear.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.689
You don't remember anything, do you?

35:11.680 --> 35:15.651
I read about this man in
Long Island who blacked out.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.120
He left a bar...

35:18.200 --> 35:22.168
...drove to the house that he'd
grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.760
He woke up the next morning oblivious to
what he did, until the police came to get him.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.800
Rachel!

35:27.880 --> 35:29.200
What? What?

35:29.280 --> 35:31.160
You have to leave.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.960
I can't do this anymore.
I'll give you a few weeks...

35:33.040 --> 35:34.166
Hold on.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.886
Hold on.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.480
Detective Riley?

35:38.560 --> 35:39.640
Yeah, I agree with you.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.440
Detective Riley?

35:41.520 --> 35:45.844
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell,
but not on Friday night.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.040
She was having an affair. She had a lover.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.160
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.640
I thought you didn't know her.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.520
No. But I saw her.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.726
You saw her where?

35:55.840 --> 35:57.000
I saw her from the train.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.242
She was standing
on the deck with this man.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.240
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.480
It wasn't him.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.291
This man was different
and they were kissing.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.885
Wow. That's pretty coincidental, isn't it?

36:09.920 --> 36:12.040
You just happen to be on a train
at the same exact moment

36:12.120 --> 36:14.200
that a woman you don't know,
but somehow recognize

36:14.280 --> 36:15.640
is cheating on her husband?

36:15.720 --> 36:16.840
I know it sounds crazy.

36:16.920 --> 36:22.000
Neighbors saw a drunk woman
in the vicinity of her house Friday night.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.924
Megan Hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.360
Mrs. Watson reported
that you go to their house

36:29.440 --> 36:30.680
sometimes uninvited

36:30.760 --> 36:34.446
and that on one occasion,
you actually broke in and took their child.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.360
Let me give you some advice.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.040
Don't go back to Beckett Road.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.360
Don't contact your ex-husband.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.200
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.360
Are you listening to me?

36:46.440 --> 36:47.601
Yes.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.206
You don't live there anymore.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.485
Stay away.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.962
You know, I lie all the time.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.040
I lie to Scott.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.690
I lie to you.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.331
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy,

37:18.160 --> 37:20.322
but I have to keep things vague.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.325
Jumble up all the men,
the exes, the lovers.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.760
It doesn't matter who they are.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.207
It matters how they make me feel.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.961
Lying is like taking a trip.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.528
It's like having a secret.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.043
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.405
Except you.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.521
But you're just pretending.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.885
You're just pretending to touch yourself.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.125
Scott's possessive.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.040
Jealous.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.249
He likes to own me.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.481
He figures out all my passwords.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.444
Which is kind of sexy.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.680
So, when I came home last night,

38:53.760 --> 38:56.920
Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...

38:57.000 --> 38:58.604
Scott's behavior is not normal.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.808
It's a form of emotional abuse.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.244
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

39:09.480 --> 39:11.005
It's not abuse.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.641
Not if you don't care, and I don't.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.561
Maybe it's become a normal state for you.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.161
Is it normal I think
about you all the time?

39:33.640 --> 39:35.000
"Almost exactly a week ago,

39:35.080 --> 39:39.120
"Megan Hipwell walked out of number
15 Beckett Road and disappeared.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.486
"No one has seen her since.

39:40.960 --> 39:45.045
"Neither her phone nor her bank cards
have been used since Friday."

39:54.200 --> 39:55.600
"A wonderful woman,

39:55.680 --> 39:58.524
"an intensely private person
with a warm heart.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.849
"She lost a brother when she was 16,

40:01.960 --> 40:04.645
"and both her parents died a few years ago.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.651
"Scott Hipwell urges
anyone with information

40:10.760 --> 40:12.250
"to please come forward."

40:27.120 --> 40:28.440
You Megan's friend?

40:28.520 --> 40:30.320
Yes. Rachel.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.447
Come in.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.360
Do you want a coffee?

40:37.440 --> 40:38.726
Uh, sure. Thank you.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.411
Sorry, it's a mess.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.967
I've been hunting for her social,
her birth certificate.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.527
The cops need a lot.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.006
Have we met somewhere before?

40:56.880 --> 40:58.200
I don't think so.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.566
And you know Megan from...

41:00.040 --> 41:01.371
Uh, from the gallery.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.721
Oh, you're an artist?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.042
Uh, well, I like to think so.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.729
So you said on the phone you wanted
to tell me something about Megan.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.805
What did you wanna tell me?

41:20.720 --> 41:26.560
I saw your wife with someone
on Friday morning.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.801
With who?

41:28.360 --> 41:31.000
She was up there on your porch.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.280
Um...

41:32.360 --> 41:36.720
I saw her from the train,
because I commute to Manhattan every day

41:36.800 --> 41:38.928
and I go straight past here.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.521
She kissed him.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.965
They were kissing.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.484
I'm sorry. I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.281
Yeah.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.289
I know how it feels.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.921
Huh.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.603
What did he look like?

42:16.440 --> 42:19.364
He was average height. He had dark hair.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.880
And they were out there on the porch?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.086
Yes.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.606
Fuck!

42:39.720 --> 42:40.926
Fuck.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.482
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.491
Okay, sure.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.840
It could... I don't know.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.126
Maybe it's a good thing.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.848
Could mean she's all right.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.160
She just ran off with someone.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.446
Right.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.086
Has she talked to you?

43:19.680 --> 43:22.440
Oh, no. Um, I haven't heard anything.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.800
You know her well enough
to know where we live.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.689
Megan doesn't have many friends.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.843
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I...

43:31.960 --> 43:33.480
We took... We took...

43:33.560 --> 43:36.000
We took Pilates together.

43:36.080 --> 43:40.040
I think I should go. I feel like
I've taken up too much of your time.

43:40.120 --> 43:44.240
So sorry to have had to
tell you that in that way...

43:44.320 --> 43:45.321
Hey.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.842
Do you think you'd
recognize him again if you saw him?

43:51.080 --> 43:52.241
I don't know.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.489
There's a guy. A therapist.

43:57.160 --> 44:00.403
His name's, um, Abdic...

44:03.560 --> 44:05.847
Um, Kamal Abdic.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.410
Is that who you saw?

44:13.920 --> 44:16.002
I don't know. I really can't tell.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.611
She spends a lot of fucking time
with her shrink.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.640
That's him.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.609
I remember. That's him.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.841
I remember. That's him.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.360
I'm sorry.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.805
Where are you?

44:53.520 --> 44:55.807
Where are you?

44:55.920 --> 44:57.206
Where are you?

44:59.840 --> 45:01.285
Where are you?

45:34.680 --> 45:36.011
Stay away from me.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.926
This is so stupid.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.843
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.800
And every time we go there...

45:44.880 --> 45:46.120
Where?

45:46.600 --> 45:48.204
To that subject.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.170
What subject?

45:54.120 --> 45:55.281
Megan?

45:56.360 --> 45:57.407
What subject?

46:15.520 --> 46:16.760
It's okay.

46:19.920 --> 46:20.921
Megan.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.601
Megan.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.169
All right, Megan.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.282
We shouldn't.

46:39.400 --> 46:40.401
No.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.361
Megan.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.211
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.049
Megan, I could lose my practice.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.800
I don't give a fuck!

47:00.920 --> 47:03.491
I don't give a fuck
about your fucking practice!

47:05.760 --> 47:06.841
I don't give a...

47:21.240 --> 47:24.210
Dr. Kamal Abdic has
been brought in for questioning

47:24.320 --> 47:27.449
on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson
resident, Megan Hipwell.

47:28.040 --> 47:31.886
He was, according to sources,
Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.686
For the first time in ages,
I have purpose.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.768
Or at least I have a distraction.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.208
I want Megan to show up
safe and sound. I do.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.726
Yeah!

47:54.920 --> 47:56.410
Just not quite yet.

48:04.640 --> 48:05.721
Hi.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.920
What's wrong?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.720
Abdic's been released.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.560
What?

48:11.640 --> 48:13.200
There wasn't enough evidence.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.520
And because I'm the one
that got him arrested, he talked.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.440
A lot.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.520
They'll build a case against him.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.200
It'll just take some time.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.520
Are you totally sure he's the guy
you saw Megan with?

48:23.600 --> 48:24.726
Yes.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.240
You sure as fuck better be.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.560
I don't understand.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.040
The police think I did it.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.080
Yeah, but he's the one...

48:32.160 --> 48:33.920
He told them Megan's miserable.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.844
That I'm a jealous, controlling husband.

48:37.680 --> 48:41.000
I'm sure that they're just
trying to rule you out.

48:41.080 --> 48:43.321
Abdic told them I'm abusive.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.847
When she walked out,
I didn't go after her.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.241
I never called to check on her.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.000
I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.320
Got drunk.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.600
No. We just need to find
more evidence on Abdic.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.840
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.760
There's no e-mails, there's nothing.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.680
No letters, no e-mails.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.046
Nothing.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.607
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.724
Fucking phone won't stop!

49:17.240 --> 49:20.722
This is Scott.
Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.480
Do you mind?

49:36.040 --> 49:37.041
Oh!

49:51.320 --> 49:52.840
Rachel, no.

49:52.920 --> 49:53.921
Ann, get in the house.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.487
Your wife hit me on Friday night.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.080
- No. What are you talking about?
- Yes.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.040
Yes, you did. Yes, you did!

50:09.120 --> 50:12.249
And then she... She got in your car.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.280
No. She said you yelled at her that night.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.720
No. That is not what happened.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.560
She was in the tunnel and she hit me.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.200
I don't wanna argue on the street.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.680
It's the middle of
the day and you're drunk.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.489
Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.400
My wife is scared of you.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.720
Of what?

50:32.520 --> 50:34.921
I don't even know if that's a joke or not.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.080
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.

50:37.160 --> 50:38.920
You know that's not how it happened.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.367
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.964
Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house?

50:52.720 --> 50:53.720
Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house?

50:53.800 --> 50:54.800
Because I'm helping...

50:54.880 --> 50:56.440
I'm helping him.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.640
How? To try and find Megan.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.927
You don't even know Megan!

51:02.120 --> 51:04.360
Rach,

51:04.440 --> 51:07.046
I don't think you're helping anybody.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.721
So you're here because
you want to uncover lost memories?

51:13.840 --> 51:16.360
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.480
Pardon?

51:17.560 --> 51:21.167
No. Sorry. I, um, wasn't expecting
you to have an accent.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.367
Well, you have an accent.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.120
Where are you from?

51:28.200 --> 51:30.200
I'm American citizen.

51:30.280 --> 51:32.567
But I guess you're not
here to talk about me.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.960
- Unless you are.
- No.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.080
Sorry, I was just, uh,
trying to make conversation.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.525
The blackouts.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.440
You're experiencing blackouts?

51:42.520 --> 51:43.521
Mmm-hmm.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.330
Do you wanna tell me about them?

51:49.440 --> 51:50.441
Mmm...

51:51.240 --> 51:57.566
Well, when I wake up,
and when someone tells me what I've done,

52:00.720 --> 52:04.640
it just doesn't feel like me,
or like something that I would do.

52:04.720 --> 52:07.200
I feel bad about it, but, um...

52:08.600 --> 52:12.047
But it's like it's so far
removed that I have a...

52:14.240 --> 52:16.320
I just don't feel bad enough.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.165
You wanna take personal
responsibility for what you've done,

52:19.280 --> 52:21.400
but you find it difficult
to feel accountable

52:21.480 --> 52:23.448
because you can't even remember it.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.886
Yeah?

52:30.040 --> 52:31.160
Yeah.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.561
So, Rachel, besides drinking...

52:35.920 --> 52:37.800
Because you clearly drink.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.042
You've been drinking today, haven't you?

52:46.920 --> 52:50.083
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

52:51.480 --> 52:52.840
I like to draw.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.843
Art, I guess.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.920
Good. We can try to regain some
of your memories by drawing them.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.920
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.840
And have you ever tracked all the way back

53:02.920 --> 53:04.445
to when you started drinking heavily?

53:06.800 --> 53:08.325
When was that?

53:10.320 --> 53:12.360
It was with Tom.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.920
When I couldn't get pregnant.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.080
Who's Tom?

53:17.160 --> 53:18.924
He's my ex-husband.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.888
You wanna talk about that?

53:22.960 --> 53:25.122
I really wanted a baby.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.969
We tried everything and nothing worked.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.801
And it just absolutely...

53:55.480 --> 53:58.643
It just broke my heart and...

54:00.240 --> 54:02.400
So I got really sad.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.084
And then, um...

54:06.480 --> 54:10.246
And then the booze just broke us.

54:12.160 --> 54:15.130
Good. Tell me more.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.000
I used to watch this perfect couple.

54:25.960 --> 54:32.525
And they were just
the embodiment of true love.

54:33.040 --> 54:36.328
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.887
And then she betrayed him.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.447
And it sparked something in me.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.566
Why are you really here, Rachel?

54:58.680 --> 55:01.729
Because I'm afraid of myself.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.640
July 5th.

55:11.720 --> 55:16.160
1:33 and 1:34, 1:37.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.720
She calls again, 1:38.

55:17.800 --> 55:22.440
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.568
And July 6th. You get the point.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.608
She sometimes texts him
dozens of times a day.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.840
But these are all from an unknown number.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.760
Unknown is Rachel.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.490
You have a log of the calls.

55:34.600 --> 55:38.280
You don't have a log of what
they're saying to each other.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.328
Look, um...

55:40.440 --> 55:42.960
Has she been back to the house
since the incident with your child?

55:43.040 --> 55:44.560
Not that I know of.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.760
Then, you may have a case
for harassment in the second degree.

55:46.840 --> 55:49.047
But these are texts, they're not threats.

55:50.520 --> 55:53.360
She has been hanging around
Scott Hipwell's house.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.441
A lot.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.685
Yeah. I'm aware.

55:58.080 --> 56:00.360
There are a lot of loose ends here
that suggest something,

56:00.440 --> 56:02.240
but they don't add up to much.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.280
If you could bring me
something more solid...

56:04.360 --> 56:06.280
What more do you need?

56:06.360 --> 56:07.600
Evidence.

56:07.840 --> 56:09.330
Real evidence.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.405
You sure your husband doesn't wanna
stay in touch with his ex-wife?

56:18.520 --> 56:21.330
What? No. She's harassing us.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.851
Is that what he calls it?

57:07.000 --> 57:08.081
Hi.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.043
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.491
Hi.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.130
Reporters are in my yard.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.529
They're everywhere.
I didn't know where else to go.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.886
Come in.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.483
The detective just...

58:13.680 --> 58:15.160
The detective just told me something

58:15.240 --> 58:17.527
I've wanted to hear for a long time.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.044
She's pregnant.

58:25.640 --> 58:27.881
She told her shrink but not me.

58:31.240 --> 58:32.924
I wanted a family.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.364
But she fought me every step of the way.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.203
We always fought about it.

58:43.880 --> 58:46.121
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

58:55.360 --> 58:56.885
She loved you.

59:00.160 --> 59:05.326
She loved you in ways that people
only dream of being loved.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.451
You shouldn't be here.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.131
I just...

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.402
I need to tell someone.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.764
Just once.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.002
Just say it out loud.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.006
I wanna tell you.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.449
And then I'll be gone. I swear.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.603
I got pregnant.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.130
I was 17.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.122
I had her by myself.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.844
She had dark eyes and blonde hair.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.405
I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.042
It was easy.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.642
Because I loved her.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.849
I loved her.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.887
We called her Elizabeth.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.291
Libby.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.721
Libby.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.729
It was December,

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.050
and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.200
He'd gone off and left.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.520
The roof was leaking.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.042
It was freezing cold,

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.209
so I got in the tub.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.041
I brought Libby in with me,
put her on my chest.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.607
Her head just under my chin.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.808
I fell asleep.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.884
I let her go.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.688
I let her go.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.163
I let her go.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.609
I let her go.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.971
I couldn't look.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.001
I didn't wanna see it.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.762
I didn't wanna see her like that.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.971
I wrapped her in a blanket
and I buried her.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.001
Mac went out that night.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.768
And he never came back.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.722
He never came back.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.444
I missed our home.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.687
So one day, when I was drunk,

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.402
I decided to go there.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.884
The front door was open.
It's not like I broke in.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.091
And then I heard Evie.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.406
Who's Evie?

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.690
Tom's baby.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.327
I know this sounds insane.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.451
But I just wanted to hold her.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.809
Just for a moment.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.681
Rachel!

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.528
What are you doing?

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.481
Rachel.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.806
Give her to me.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.921
Shh.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.721
Mommy's here. Shh.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.041
Shh.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.489
I wasn't going to hurt her.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.563
I would never hurt her.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.049
I just wanted to hold her.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.320
"Partially decomposed body found.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.920
"Female body found.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.200
"Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body found.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.680
"Megan Hipwell. Blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.286
"Investigation now
being called a homicide.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.480
"Sources say the partially
decomposed body found

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.006
"is missing Ardsley woman, Megan Hipwell.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.680
"Death a result of blunt force trauma.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.843
"Megan Hipwell's investigation
now being called a homicide."

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.441
What's wrong?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.005
I'm sorry.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.279
This reminds me of
when I used to watch you

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.399
getting dressed before going back to her.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.881
Back to this house.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.371
I actually miss being the other woman.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.920
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.331
Seriously?

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.881
Can we not fixate on her?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.363
I saw her again today.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.160
Where?

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.840
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.921
She was across the street.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.920
And when she saw me, she got aggressive.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.920
Aggressive how?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.207
What if Rachel killed Megan?

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.488
Rachel did not kill Megan.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.688
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.450
- She's dangerous and you know it.
- Anna. Anna.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.080
Sweetheart.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.800
Rachel is a sad person.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.167
She's completely harmless.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.000
What are you doing here?

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.923
How did you get in?

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.362
Come here. Have a beer with me.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.961
I'm not drinking right now.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.244
Detective Riley came to see me last night.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.451
And turns out, I'm not the father.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.961
Neither is the shrink.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.644
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.526
Sit down.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.170
Sit down!

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.120
Look, I don't know what this is about.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.400
Oh, come on.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.006
You and Megan were such good friends.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.449
You must have known.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.164
Admit it.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.845
Admit what?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.004
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.124
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.081
She used other words, too.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.560
Alcoholic. Maybe even mentally unstable.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.849
I am sorry. I was honestly
just trying to help you.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.529
You're Tom's crazy ex.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.120
When the fuck were
you gonna tell me that, huh?

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.522
And now the detective is asking
if you and I are in a relationship?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.280
You?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.880
I would never even get near
someone like you!

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.045
My wife is dead and you're lying to me!

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.960
What's wrong with you?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.000
Who does this?

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.040
I needed to tell you about Megan's affair,

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.640
and you wouldn't have believed me
if I was just Tom's ex!

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.880
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic
to point the finger at me.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.203
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.569
How are they going, huh?

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.280
You know, the sessions.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.847
With the doctor.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:05.520
I wanted to know about Abdic
and I went to him to help you.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.840
You're just a sad liar with no life.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.280
You're all liars.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.407
Please!

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.091
God.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.640
I need to file a statement.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720
Name?

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800
Rachel Watson.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.882
Pete, I got this.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.442
You wanted to file a statement?

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.931
I'm listening.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.686
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.411
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott Hipwell?

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.726
No. We were just friends.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.560
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.760
You got him to stay overnight
at your apartment, right?

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.920
No, you need the context.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.320
I know the context.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.000
But what I'm trying to determine is when
your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.520
Was it before or after
his pregnant wife was murdered?

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.720
You were neighbors at one point.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.160
I met him after.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.760
After being questioned by me,

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.880
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.400
And then you manage to
get him to incriminate himself,

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.520
all the while hoping he'll fuck you.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.602
I came here trying to help you.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.405
He just assaulted me in my own house!

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.120
You were seen in the area that night.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.040
There are several hours that you say
you can't account for.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.691
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.050
No, he didn't.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.560
Surveillance footage from a sports bar

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.849
accounts for Mr. Hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.165
You're lying.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.449
You're lying.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.404
Tell me what happened.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.411
It's okay.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.370
Tell me.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.209
I don't know.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.964
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.841
Hi.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.009
I need to see you.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.402
Can you please come over?

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.166
I can still see her dark eyes.
I can smell her skin.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.441
I can feel how cold she was.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.324
Forgive yourself.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.168
You don't have to be
afraid of being alone.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.488
You're not alone.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.881
You'll be fine.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.928
You and your baby will be fine.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.607
Why are you following me?
Why are you here?

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.360
I could ask you the same question.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.480
I saw you...

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.928
I saw you that night in the tunnel.
I saw you there and...

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.280
- All right.
- I know I saw you there.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.966
Lady, I live here.
I'm always in that tunnel.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.321
But what did you see?

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.200
What happened that night?
What did you see?

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.040
All right. You, uh...

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.560
You busted your ass. You fell.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.360
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.520
You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.840
Was I with anyone?
Was I alone? What happened?

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.840
I don't know.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.764
You were wasted. You're always wasted.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.128
That's all I can tell you.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.480
Whoa. Take it easy.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.565
I need you to tell me the fucking truth.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.481
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.045
I don't know.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.482
I'm assuming it's the worst.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.605
God.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.082
Come here for one second. Just one second.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.600
Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd."

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.040
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.600
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked Tom on the...

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.440
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else,

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.080
betraying her husband, I felt

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.760
pure rage.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.571
If I could, I'd go to her house,

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.960
I'd find her sitting there and...

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.929
Smash her head all over the floor!

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.880
Cathy, thank you
for all you have done for me.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.520
I'm sorry to leave this way.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.480
I'll send for my things later.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.686
Love, Rachel.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.569
That is so true!

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.480
It's the worst restaurant ever.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.164
Why do we keep going back?

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.280
Martha?

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.486
Martha.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.205
Rachel?

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.289
I haven't seen you in a million years.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.806
Yeah, I wanted to call you.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.366
Um, but Tom said I should
just leave it alone.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.886
- Oh.
- Um...

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.045
I'm so sorry.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.366
For what?

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.442
For the barbecue,

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.880
and I just need you to know
that I don't remember anything,

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.640
and, um, I just completely blacked out.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.800
Everyone had a little too much
to drink, so it's okay.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.720
I know, but with the eggs,
and then I screamed at you.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.320
That I was that abusive, I just feel...

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.085
I just feel so ashamed about it.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.640
Um...

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.881
I don't...

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:20.680
Tom said that I smashed
your plate. I don't...

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.082
Tom was fired because of how I behaved.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.360
You felt sick and you took
a nap in our guest bedroom.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.566
Do you wanna lie down?

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.490
- Come with me.
- Okay.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.360
Excuse us.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.124
Rachel, are you feeling better?

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.320
You guys can stay the night if you want.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.600
No. That's fine.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.680
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.206
I think I'd remember
if you caused a scene.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.491
I'm so sorry.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.641
Get up.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.400
And then Tom took you home.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.080
I'm sorry, Tom.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.360
Stop fucking saying that!
I know you're sorry!

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440
Sorry.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.200
What's your fucking problem?
You can't even focus on me.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.360
Can't even fucking stand up!

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.442
What is wrong with you? Can you stand?

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.364
Fucking disgusting.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.080
No. No.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.040
Yeah. Tom got fired because
he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.090
You did nothing wrong. Nothing.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.962
Wake the fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.687
Wake up!

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.724
You can sleep out here.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.201
We all felt so bad for you.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.322
He's such a bad guy.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.400
Ugh, God.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.845
Are you okay?

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.801
Hmm.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.961
I need to see you. Meet me at 3:00.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.840
I'm here. Where are you?

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.640
I can't. I'm stuck watching Evie.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.243
What are you doing up?

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.643
Picking up after Evie.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.240
You whore!

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.161
Leave us alone.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.960
No new messages.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.040
No saved messages.

You okay?

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.440
I thought I heard something.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.682
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.006
I just...

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.690
Come back to bed.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.730
Whore!

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.124
Rachel's down there.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.201
What the hell are you doing?

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.531
Come here.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.371
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.126
You're okay. You just need some help.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.480
- Don't touch me.
- You just need to get a little help up.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.891
Just fuck off. Fuck off!

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.161
Oh.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.246
Anna?

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.600
- No. Go away!
- Anna, please. Please.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.720
- There's... Okay.
- Go!

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.040
I'm gonna stand right here.
I'm not gonna come closer.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.320
I just need to talk to you.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.160
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.571
Where's Tom?

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.447
He's lying to you.

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.280
He always does. He's a good liar.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.640
I know he's a good liar.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.041
We went behind your back for months.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.760
He's just done it to you.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.285
I know he's cheating.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.200
I know.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.040
- Anna, he killed Megan.
- No, we don't...

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.400
We don't know that.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.320
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.000
- Anna, you need to leave. You need to leave.
- No. No.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.040
- You need to take Evie and you need to leave.
- No.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.327
- Get out of here. It's not safe.
- I'm not leaving him.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.165
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.880
It's not about the affair
and you know that deep down.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.600
- Anna, please, just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.680
Please come with me.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.560
- Anna, don't.
- Come in the house, honey.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.801
Please.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.520
I saw you, Tom. You motherfucker!

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.047
I saw you, you murderer!
You fucking murderer!

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.369
You killed her!
You fucking killed her! I know it!

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.600
Un-fucking-believable!

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.800
Listen to me. Megan got
into his car that night.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.480
You think I don't remember.
You thought I blacked out. I saw you.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.080
Why did Megan get in your car?

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.840
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.365
Yes, she did!

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.960
Tell her the truth.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.240
Just tell her the truth right now.

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.040
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you!

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.406
I found Megan's phone.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.569
I found it.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.325
So all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.842
So were you fucking her
while she was here working?

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.810
While she was looking after our daughter?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.080
Yeah.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.130
You were so tired all the time and...

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.283
It's all about Evie.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.444
That's right.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.046
It was all about you, wasn't it?

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.800
Tom, give her to me.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.291
It's all right.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.560
It was all about you, wasn't it?

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.000
Tom, give her to me. Please.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.680
- Please give her to me.
- She's fine.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.480
- I think she needs changing, please?
- She's gonna be fine.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.050
Please just give her to me.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.401
Shh.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.320
- Let her go. You're gonna hurt her.
- Change her here.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.289
Okay. I'll change her.
Let her go. You're gonna hurt her.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.767
Shh.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.406
911, what's your...

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.646
What's your emergency?

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.087
No. Stay.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.481
Stay.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.246
Do you need a drink?

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.361
No.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.130
Yeah, you do.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.449
All those things that you said I did...

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.929
Those terrible things,
I didn't do any of them.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.200
You just watched me suffer.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.487
You made me feel so worthless.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:52.483
You made me think
that everything was my fault.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.206
Drink it.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.322
You told me I got you fired.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.850
But I didn't.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.880
You know, I saw Martha on the train.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.007
Drink it!

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.520
I saw Martha on the train,

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.120
and she told me that you were fired

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.363
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.440
Shh.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.760
Rachel's down there.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.205
Wait here.

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.329
Gonna get in the car?

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.045
What's going on?

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.930
Don't worry about it.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.925
Come on.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.450
Okay, I'm here.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.330
So what is it?

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.967
I just wanna go to the woods.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.007
What is it with you crazy women?

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.529
Is that what you want?

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.681
No.

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.281
Oh.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.245
Like this?

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.080
What?

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.605
I'm pregnant.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.331
Congratulations.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.968
I thought you should know.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.208
You thought I should know?

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.520
There's a chance it could be yours.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.409
Then get an abortion.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.766
Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want,

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.210
but if it's not, then get rid of it.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.169
You can be as involved as you want.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.320
You're a shitty nanny.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.051
What makes you think
you're gonna be a good mother?

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.760
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.446
Because I thought it would be fun
to have you both around.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.000
I played your game so you could
fuck me in between Evie's playdates.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.360
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.727
I took care of your kid to be near you!

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.360
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.480
and you fucked me
'cause you couldn't fuck Anna.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.770
Take us all away and you're
just a pathetic, impotent man.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.164
You're not gonna get rid of me.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.045
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.964
You're like a dog.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.890
Like one of those unwanted,

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.849
mistreated dogs.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.964
And if you kick them,

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.280
they keep coming back to you.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.760
Thinking that somehow if they're good...

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.968
You're not doing this again.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.760
...you'll love them.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.003
This is what you do.
You're not doing this to me.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.247
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.409
If you'd just stayed away
that one night...

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:53.244
Just left us all alone...

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.128
You brought this on Megan.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.446
In a way, you killed her.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.404
But I didn't.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.130
You did.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.367
No!

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.326
And you did this to me in our marriage.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.844
You made me fucking crazy.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.891
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be married to a fucking blur?

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.608
I had no choice. He was...

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.728
He would have killed me.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.211
I never wanted to hurt him.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.449
It was self-defense.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:56.004
She had no choice.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.168
Tom would have killed her.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.003
I saw the whole thing.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.607
Rachel was right about Megan.

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.087
She was right about everything.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.486
We're tied forever now, the three of us.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.411
Bound forever by the story we share.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.448
Today, I sit in a different car
and I look ahead.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.809
Anything is possible,
because I am not the girl I used to be.
