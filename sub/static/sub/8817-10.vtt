WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:10.553
Previously on "Billions"...

00:10.553 --> 00:12.055
Get everything you might
possibly need,

00:12.055 --> 00:14.223
'cause they will destroy
anything left behind.

00:14.223 --> 00:17.518
You blew up your family
for Bobby Axelrod.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.479
I'm Keyser Soze,
motherfucker.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.190
Judge on the Dollar Bill case

00:22.190 --> 00:23.858
is going to be
Whit fucking Wilcox.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.109
-Ugh.
-[Chuck] I wonder

00:25.109 --> 00:28.320
if re-presented a warrant
for bugging the Axelrod home.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.739
-No. Asked and answered.
[glasses thud]

00:30.739 --> 00:33.325
Look into Wilcox.
Go wherever it leads.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.245
You're making a move
on a federal judge.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.705
Is he in your way?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.166
If you were in my situation,
what would you do?

00:40.166 --> 00:42.668
You know, if you hadn't
done anything wrong,

00:42.668 --> 00:44.503
but you were targeted anyway.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.047
You want me to pressure
my husband to back off.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.090
You know I can't do that.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.009
-Why not?
-[Adam] So I'm thrilled

00:50.009 --> 00:51.844
you got someone
on the inside at Axe Cap.

00:51.844 --> 00:53.138
I have no idea,

00:53.138 --> 00:55.973
because as you damn well know,
I've recused myself.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.225
[door thuds, lock clatters]
-[man] FBI!

00:57.225 --> 00:58.726
[gasps, exhales sharply]

00:58.726 --> 01:00.270
-There's someone in the house.
-[Donnie] It'll be fine.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.062
[Dale] Sorry about
your front door.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.147
It's all right.
He can afford another one.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.231
[handcuffs click]
-[Dale] Go.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.441
Donnie Caan walked out.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.193
He say anything about
where he was going?

01:07.193 --> 01:09.154
I think it'd be good
if you found him, soon.

01:09.154 --> 01:11.906
Where...the fuck...is Donnie?

01:11.906 --> 01:13.574
[Bobby] He could decide to walk
into their office

01:13.574 --> 01:14.700
and tell 'em everything.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.577
I'll testify against Axe,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.746
but right now I need -- [coughs]

01:18.746 --> 01:21.290
-[Terri] Ugh!
-Holy shit. Donnie? No.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.292
Donnie.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.920
-[Terri] Oh, fuck.
-[Bryan] Donnie.

01:32.551 --> 01:36.096
â™ª theme music â™ª

01:44.647 --> 01:47.525
[inhales deeply]

01:47.525 --> 01:48.776
[exhales deeply]

01:48.776 --> 01:52.112
[indistinct conversations]

01:52.112 --> 01:53.281
[door opens]

01:53.281 --> 01:56.825
â™ª pensive music â™ª

01:56.825 --> 01:59.078
You know, I was, for a time,

01:59.078 --> 02:02.581
supposed to become
a Grandmaster.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.875
Chess.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.544
14 years old,

02:06.544 --> 02:10.340
and leapfrogging up
the standings. [exhales]

02:10.340 --> 02:11.715
Put me in a practice game,

02:11.715 --> 02:15.344
and I'd be a young Boris Spassky
in his prime.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.054
By all rights,

02:17.054 --> 02:20.225
I should've dominated
live competition,

02:20.225 --> 02:22.226
but I had a flaw.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.228
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:24.228 --> 02:30.150
If I decided that my opponent
didn't...respect the game,

02:30.150 --> 02:33.529
or me, or if I didn't like
the way he carried himself...

02:33.529 --> 02:38.951
If I decided for whatever reason
that he wasn't worthy,

02:38.951 --> 02:42.746
a dark rage would come over me.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.457
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:45.457 --> 02:49.962
And this rage became the driver.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.799
All the strategy, patience,
and practice would vanish,

02:53.799 --> 02:58.053
and I would begin obsessing
about total destruction.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.889
Some kid could fail
to look me in the eye

03:00.889 --> 03:03.393
while shaking my hand
at a tournament in the fall,

03:03.393 --> 03:07.354
and I would carry it until
facing him again in the spring.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.524
But then, while I was trying
to destroy him...

03:10.524 --> 03:12.901
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

03:12.901 --> 03:15.112
[laughs] I'd forget to win.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.447
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

03:16.447 --> 03:20.075
I would play bold moves
designed to intimidate,

03:20.075 --> 03:23.537
show him that he wasn't
as smart as me...or as brave.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.165
Leave voids in my defense.

03:26.165 --> 03:28.667
That's not how you win at chess.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.545
I knew  better,

03:31.545 --> 03:34.089
but, uh...

03:34.089 --> 03:36.216
[whispers]
but I couldn't do  better.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.886
[normal voice] And then,
at the end of the game,

03:38.886 --> 03:41.805
my opponent's arm
would be raised in victory

03:41.805 --> 03:44.767
while I sat,

03:44.767 --> 03:48.562
humiliated and alone,

03:48.562 --> 03:52.191
bathed in anger and defeat.

03:54.652 --> 03:59.365
[sighs heavily]
Here I am again, beaten.

03:59.365 --> 04:03.285
Although it has yet
to be confirmed,

04:03.285 --> 04:07.581
there is no doubt
that Donnie Caan is gonna die.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.042
Soon. [chuckles]

04:10.042 --> 04:13.504
I sat up all night
until I saw it.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.383
Bobby Axelrod used Donnie
to feed us information

04:17.383 --> 04:21.471
that he would never live
to testify to

04:21.471 --> 04:24.390
or confirm in court.
[sighs]

04:24.390 --> 04:26.975
We'll claw back
some of his trades, sure,

04:26.975 --> 04:30.145
but we have to assume
that the names he gave us,

04:30.145 --> 04:33.732
the specifics, all of it --
false.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.901
[Chuck sighs]

04:35.901 --> 04:37.861
â™ª pulsating music â™ª

04:37.861 --> 04:42.157
No, I wish this loss
were mine alone,

04:42.157 --> 04:46.745
but I cost all of you as well.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.873
Soon, probably within the hour,

04:49.873 --> 04:52.418
uh, Adam DeGiulio from
the Attorney General's office

04:52.418 --> 04:54.336
will walk in here

04:54.336 --> 04:58.006
and take us off
the Axelrod case.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.635
It won't matter that Axelrod
is everything  I said he is --

05:01.635 --> 05:04.012
a bloodless man.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.890
A man who would use
his dying friend

05:06.890 --> 05:09.309
in the manner that he did.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.812
We needed to be bloodless
to catch him,

05:11.812 --> 05:15.107
and we weren't.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.317
I  wasn't.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
â™ª pulsating music quickens â™ª

05:19.319 --> 05:21.489
We were all
suckers here, Chuck.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.615
No, don't try to fall on it,
Bryan.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.326
I set the tone.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.953
That's what the papers will say.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.915
They'll call me sloppy.
[sniffles] Driven, unhinged.

05:31.915 --> 05:35.627
And, uh, for once,
they'll be correct.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.505
What can we do?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.923
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

05:39.923 --> 05:42.468
We can,
from this moment forward,

05:42.468 --> 05:46.847
remember how the game
is supposed to be played.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.891
We'll play perfect strategy.

05:48.891 --> 05:53.562
We will retreat so we can attack
when it is to our advantage.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.024
And then someday soon,
we will be standing here,

05:57.024 --> 06:00.027
and it will be our  turn.
[inhales sharply]

06:04.823 --> 06:06.450
I don't wanna
stop you, Chuck.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.327
No, we were just
finishing up.

You got a handle on this?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.709
I do not.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.587
Well, I don't think
it's good.

It was tough on both of you.

10:25.876 --> 10:29.337
Yeah, so I kind of just
gave her everything.

Didn't shelter it

11:02.496 --> 11:05.415
-...not what they have  to.
-Yeah.

11:05.415 --> 11:08.877
Thought I was going to take care
of that in the next 10 years.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.630
Forty million.

11:11.630 --> 11:15.759
What if we could
get you there, pre-tax?

11:15.759 --> 11:18.804
-For all the family?
-Big ladder.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.889
But there's a way
to make it happen.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.016
To guarantee it.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.727
Rewards of paradise
here on earth?

11:24.727 --> 11:26.019
[inhales sharply]

11:26.019 --> 11:27.354
Really sharp evangelists

11:27.354 --> 11:29.439
could con me
out of my house right now.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.734
Unlike him, I'm gonna
give you the downside.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.694
It won't be simple.
It'll require deception.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.866
And your final weeks and months,
they won't be your own.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.700
Are we talking about
breaking the law?

11:40.700 --> 11:44.496
Because I-I can't spend
one minute in jail.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.665
Well, let's leave that
to the lawyers.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.668
â™ª tense music â™ª

11:51.837 --> 11:54.840
[leaves crunching]

11:54.840 --> 11:58.176
[breathing heavily]

11:58.176 --> 12:01.096
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

12:03.890 --> 12:06.893
[birds chirping]

12:08.353 --> 12:10.522
[sighs]

12:10.522 --> 12:12.983
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

12:12.983 --> 12:14.568
[door opens]

12:14.568 --> 12:16.611
[footsteps approach]

12:16.611 --> 12:19.782
-Let me save you some breath.
[door closes]

12:19.782 --> 12:22.534
Now the Attorney General thinks
it best that my office

12:22.534 --> 12:25.704
drop its pursuit
of Axe Capital.

12:25.704 --> 12:29.207
And you tried to argue with her,
but she was insistent.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.418
Kids would hashtag that
"one hundred."

12:32.794 --> 12:34.754
Any matter related to
Axe Capital

12:34.754 --> 12:36.131
is to be handled by
the Eastern District

12:36.131 --> 12:37.799
from here forward.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.718
You know, the only thing
I can't figure

12:39.718 --> 12:42.304
is if the AG's fear
of negative publicity

12:42.304 --> 12:44.514
is because she's planning
a Senate run

12:44.514 --> 12:46.641
or a return
to the private sector.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.768
Put on a blindfold,
spin yourself around,

12:48.768 --> 12:51.479
and pin the tail
on the donkey.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.816
-You know?
-[chuckles] I do.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.151
Defy her in any way,

12:56.151 --> 12:57.903
she will recommend
that the President fire you.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.739
And he will not hesitate
to take a recommendation.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.157
I know.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.118
And I would do the same thing
were I sitting in her office.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.163
I accept it.

13:08.163 --> 13:11.166
I am off Axelrod.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.709
[sighs]

13:12.709 --> 13:13.877
Good man.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.422
But, you know, that is not

13:17.422 --> 13:19.841
what you and I really need
to talk about today.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.886
It's not? [sighs]

13:21.886 --> 13:23.678
Let's go out
and take some air,

13:23.678 --> 13:26.139
and I'll tell you why
musical chairs

13:26.139 --> 13:29.309
is a much better
party game.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.977
-Oh. Walter.
-Hey, Wendy.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.771
[minister] Friends.

13:32.771 --> 13:36.066
Friends, may I ask that you all
please take your seats now?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.404
[under breath] Fuck.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.040
[people murmuring,
bird calling in distance]

13:52.040 --> 13:54.001
Come on. I'll sit with you.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.211
What are you doing here?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.004
Came to pay my respects.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.297
Not appropriate.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.174
I knew the man.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.843
Better than you let on,
I'm sure.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.430
Turn and leave.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.392
Why would I?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.898
[whispers]
Get the fuck out of here.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.109
[scoffs]

14:19.109 --> 14:21.319
[people murmuring]

14:21.319 --> 14:22.862
All right.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.993
[footsteps depart]

14:40.630 --> 14:43.842
[bird calling in distance]

14:49.806 --> 14:51.058
[paper rustles]

14:56.896 --> 14:59.316
It's a real loss.

15:01.110 --> 15:05.488
Yeah. For both of us.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.830
[paper rustles]

15:15.290 --> 15:17.250
[bird chirping]

15:24.966 --> 15:26.801
[Bobby]
Those ungrateful fuckers

15:26.801 --> 15:28.803
have to make me
focus on this now?

15:28.803 --> 15:31.222
[Wags] They hope you are
too distracted and sad

15:31.222 --> 15:32.515
to focus on it at all.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.810
Oh. I can still focus. Talk.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.688
So Ionosphere Fund --
they set up shop downtown.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.814
Carly's in charge?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.067
Or Channing.
Definitely not Hlasa.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.443
How much?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.987
Two-hundred million under
management, 40 of it's theirs.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.863
Where's it coming from?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.115
[tablet thuds]

15:51.118 --> 15:53.996
They stole this list.
Some of these people are ours.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.038
Can we block that?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.623
We absolutely could.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.666
All three of them signed
non-competes.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.252
But they can fight it,
claim that

16:01.252 --> 16:04.756
Axe Capital was no longer
the place they signed on to,

16:04.756 --> 16:06.549
that their deals should be void.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.010
They can't win, right?

16:08.010 --> 16:11.221
Not likely. But with the current
sentiment, who knows?

16:11.221 --> 16:13.973
And I don't think you want that
kind of attention right now.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.559
No, but we can't have
the perception

16:16.559 --> 16:18.853
that the real talent
at Axe Capital

16:18.853 --> 16:20.397
is flying under a new flag.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.357
[Wags] Where you going?

16:22.357 --> 16:24.109
-Breakfast.
[door handle clicks]

16:24.109 --> 16:25.652

16:34.119 --> 16:38.289
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

16:38.289 --> 16:40.125
I'm not putting
our friendship on the line.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.001
I'm just asking.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.002
[clink]
-[Bobby] I'm just trying to warn

16:43.002 --> 16:45.046
you that this Ionosphere venture
is doomed.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.464
You trained these guys,
right?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.925
I taught 'em all they know,
not all I  know.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.009
[whirring]

16:50.009 --> 16:51.719
[Bobby] But you extend them
credit, it's on you.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.012
It is.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.514
I already have.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.267
I'm first money in,
I got very favorable terms,

16:57.267 --> 16:59.727
and I don't see a reason
to give that up.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.855
Do this for me, and I'll cut
your fees to one and ten

17:01.855 --> 17:03.148
over the next three quarters.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.691
I can't.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.110
Check, sir.

17:06.110 --> 17:08.027
[chair scrapes floor]

17:08.027 --> 17:10.238
[minister] It is the love
God has instilled in us

17:10.238 --> 17:12.157
that has been our refuge,

17:12.157 --> 17:15.201
that has sustained us
for generations.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.121
Before the mountains were
brought forth,

17:18.121 --> 17:20.165
or the earth was born,

17:20.165 --> 17:23.042
-...there was love.
[liquid sloshes in flask]

17:23.042 --> 17:26.880
And it is love that turns us
back to dust,

17:26.880 --> 17:30.800
saying, "Go back,
oh, child of earth."

17:30.800 --> 17:35.263
It is love that sweeps us away
like a dream.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.891
[Orrin] Your honor,
our argument is

17:37.891 --> 17:39.809
simple and straightforward.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.562
My client provided
emergency medical care

17:42.562 --> 17:44.148
to Christina Grunwald.

17:44.148 --> 17:47.192
Mr. Stearn met
the young lady's father,

17:47.192 --> 17:50.028
learned of her desperate
medical condition,

17:50.028 --> 17:54.032
had the resources at
his disposal to save her life,

17:54.032 --> 17:55.283
and was moved to action.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.744
I ask, uh, you to

17:57.744 --> 18:00.079
look at this photograph

18:00.079 --> 18:01.539
and tell me that,

18:01.539 --> 18:05.335
if you were in a position
to save this child's life...

18:05.335 --> 18:06.711
â™ª serious music â™ª

18:06.711 --> 18:08.963
wouldn't you do it
just because you could?

18:08.963 --> 18:11.132
Mr. Stearn had no idea

18:11.132 --> 18:13.218
that medical treatment
had any link

18:13.218 --> 18:16.679
to alleged inside information.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.265
[Orrin scoffs]

18:18.265 --> 18:23.270
I ask you to consider the wisdom
of putting altruism itself

18:23.270 --> 18:26.148
on trial.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.024
May I?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.817
-Mr. Connerty.
[chair scrapes floor]

18:29.817 --> 18:31.778
The people are
fully prepared to prove

18:31.778 --> 18:34.155
benefit was provided
in the form of medical expenses

18:34.155 --> 18:36.449
to the tune
of some 211,000 dollars.

18:36.449 --> 18:40.161
And that, as a direct response
to insider information

18:40.161 --> 18:41.412
provided to Mr. Stearn.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.373
Further, we can demonstrate

18:43.373 --> 18:45.208
that Axe Capital
used this information

18:45.208 --> 18:49.171
to gain
an 89 million dollar profit.

18:49.171 --> 18:54.050
An 89 million dollar return.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.053
[footsteps approach]

18:57.053 --> 18:59.597
On a 211,000 dollar...

18:59.597 --> 19:02.225
[finger thuds]
-[Bryan] ...investment.

19:06.604 --> 19:11.025
Altruism is not on trial here,

19:11.025 --> 19:14.946
but the fairness of
the financial markets is.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.031
[footsteps thudding]

19:17.031 --> 19:20.034
The US Attorney's office has
made a considered decision

19:20.034 --> 19:21.703
to pursue and prosecute

19:21.703 --> 19:24.789
precisely this new brand
of criminal.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.541
They are bastardizing
the fair market

19:26.541 --> 19:29.586
upon which this country
is built.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.170
Passionately executed,
Mr. Connerty,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.798
but the humane gesture of
providing medical treatment

19:33.798 --> 19:37.261
for an afflicted child
as material benefit,

19:37.261 --> 19:39.470
begs that a jury learn
the unknowable --

19:39.470 --> 19:43.683
that is, what lay
in Mr. Stearn's heart.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.353
I deem it best
that the court grants

19:46.353 --> 19:49.105
defense counsel's motion
for dismissal.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.816
Your honor,
I vigorously protest.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.110
Nonetheless,
my decision stands.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.989
And I further advise that
you and the Southern District

19:57.989 --> 20:01.200
reconsider the deployment
of government assets

20:01.200 --> 20:04.579
in the settling
of personal scores.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.291
This session is adjourned.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.302
[Chuck]
He said "personal scores"?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.888
He used those words?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.849
-Direct quote.
-[Chuck scoffs]

20:24.849 --> 20:26.476
[Chuck] Motherfucker.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.728
How goddamn comfortable
in your seat do you have to be

20:28.728 --> 20:31.189
to do that? [inhales sharply]

20:31.189 --> 20:33.358
[exhales deeply]

20:33.358 --> 20:36.361
Should we start clearing
the Axelrod files or...

20:36.361 --> 20:38.821
Tomorrow.

20:38.821 --> 20:42.116
What you need to do now
is take the day, at least.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.243
-Come back ready to go.
-I can hang in here...

20:44.243 --> 20:45.995
[Chuck] Go!

20:45.995 --> 20:49.416
Breathe in some fall air.
[smacks lips]

20:49.416 --> 20:51.084
I'd like to imagine someone
is doing that today.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.293
Might as well be you.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.464
[scoffs] I bet Dollar Bill
is doing exactly that

20:55.464 --> 20:57.757
with a giant fucking smile
on his face.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.345
[Kate] What are you gonna do?

21:02.345 --> 21:04.263
Well, we've lost
the Axe case.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.850
Wilcox cut
the Dollar Bill thread.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.103
We need to get circular
with our thinking.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.360
[Chuck] Turn the impediments
into our own blockers.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.486
[sighs]

21:18.486 --> 21:21.406
Don't worry.
I know what I'm talking about.

[telephone ringing in distance]

21:25.702 --> 21:27.203
He wanted to see me?

21:27.203 --> 21:29.038
He did, but not right now.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.624
This about those
Ionosphere traitors?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.835

21:33.835 --> 21:36.463
Don't answer that.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.047
[exhales deeply]
So, Deb...

21:38.047 --> 21:39.298
Don't.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.508
[exhales sharply]
I make stupid money,

21:40.508 --> 21:42.093
and I'm ready
for a relationship.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.845
I make plenty,
and I'm out of your league.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.722
You're right.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.475
Guys around here avoid you like
you're a dangerous fighter,

21:48.475 --> 21:49.684
because you're
a triple threat --

21:49.684 --> 21:52.478
power, speed, and  footwork.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.355
So give me some credit
for stepping up.

-Oh, see?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.532
See? You smiled.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.409
And you know and I know
that a smile

22:06.409 --> 22:09.912
is a gateway to
multiple convulsive orgasms.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.956
I smiled because I'm too long
for a Mini,

22:11.956 --> 22:14.208
and you almost look cute

I heard they went out on their

23:46.425 --> 23:49.053
-I did not  bless that at all.
-That's a shame!

23:49.053 --> 23:51.180

I'm gonna poke you.

"Have them all bury my picture

And beneath the layers?

26:23.332 --> 26:25.501
Wilcox.
Greasy muck on his shoes.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.585
Talk to me.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.296
Well, I looked at
his sentencing history,

26:29.296 --> 26:30.589
and about seven years ago,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.675
there's a significant
pattern shift.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.010
Suddenly, he becomes

26:34.010 --> 26:35.720
the toughest hanging judge
on the federal bench,

26:35.720 --> 26:37.513
but not
on white collar crime.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.516
-Oh, no?
-No, not on white of any kind.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.268
He lets the white guys skate

26:42.268 --> 26:45.354
if he thinks you have access
to lawyers or press

26:45.354 --> 26:46.773

Uh-huh. Now is that racism,
or is there money somewhere?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.614
Well, I did a deep dive
on his financial history,

26:55.614 --> 26:58.826
and seven years ago,
he joined an investment group.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.787
One of their holdings --
Baldinger Prison Systems,

27:01.787 --> 27:04.915
a privatized
for-profit prison company.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.543
They charge inmates a dollar
a minute to use the phone...

27:07.543 --> 27:08.711
[laughs]

27:08.711 --> 27:12.214
And then soak the government
with a 300% markup.

27:12.214 --> 27:16.218
They net 17,000 dollars a year
per prisoner.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.345
Wilcox is building his business
from the bench.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.555
Exactly.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.807
And he's doing it

but it winds up in Dominican,

33:00.979 --> 33:04.150
[whirring]

33:16.495 --> 33:21.042
Four million dollar rip on DKA,
up 2% in our first week.

33:21.042 --> 33:24.294
There are tips,
and there are tips.

33:24.294 --> 33:26.004
[inhales deeply ] You plan on
telling us where you got it?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.632
You'll hear the next one
yourself.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.384
[Channing] He's here.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.928
[Carly] Dollar Bill,
Mr. Hundred Cent.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.639
Billy Buck Buck, motherfucker!

33:35.639 --> 33:36.932
I should've known.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.058
Everyone's been talking about
your brawl with Axe.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.103
[groans] Fucking prick.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.231
I keep my mouth shut,
risk doing time for him,

33:44.231 --> 33:46.192
and then he treats me
like that.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.026
[slaps leg]
-[Carly sighs]

33:48.026 --> 33:50.904
-[groans]
-[grunts]

33:50.904 --> 33:53.116
Look at this.

33:53.116 --> 33:54.700
Little shop that could.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.453
And from the acorn
grew the mighty oak.

33:57.453 --> 34:00.205
No doubt,
all-star team like this.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.207
[Channing]
Could always use one more.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.420
Champagne?

34:09.631 --> 34:11.259
I'll take
one of those Heinekens.

34:11.259 --> 34:14.303
[bottles clank]

34:14.303 --> 34:15.637
[cap fizzes and pops]

34:18.891 --> 34:20.767
[bottle cap clatters]
-What do you say?

34:20.767 --> 34:23.228
We can talk after
the first of the year.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.689
I am contractually owed
a bonus.

34:25.689 --> 34:27.024
[chuckles]

34:27.024 --> 34:28.358
Meantime,
want some more candy?

34:28.358 --> 34:29.902
Yeah.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.947
You know how Penn Consol's been
rising on takeover rumors?

34:33.947 --> 34:35.365
I've been watching that.

34:35.365 --> 34:38.160
Behind the scenes?
There's a bidding war.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.704
It is fucking on.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.080
Sure?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.875
I am not uncertain.

34:44.875 --> 34:48.170
[laughter, glasses clink]

34:48.170 --> 34:49.838
[knock on door]

34:49.838 --> 34:52.175
-Come on in, Chuck. Sit down.
[door opens]

34:52.175 --> 34:54.176
I can deliver this
on my feet.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.385
[door closes]

34:55.385 --> 34:57.346
Know that
if this "urgent meeting"

34:57.346 --> 35:00.308
is to slam me for my ruling
on the William Stearn case,

35:00.308 --> 35:02.976
you should proceed to
the other side of that door

35:02.976 --> 35:04.853
and tell it to the doorknob.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.105
Whit, that's a closed case.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.233
Forget "Dollar" Bill Stearn.

35:09.233 --> 35:12.569
No, this is about
Daquan Forrester.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.780
You remember Daquan, the first
offender kid dealing pot

35:14.780 --> 35:17.074
he bought in New Jersey
his senior year of high school

35:17.074 --> 35:20.328
that you slapped
with 15 years?

35:20.328 --> 35:21.828
What about him?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.872
It's about Julio Lopez.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.499
Remember him, too?

35:25.499 --> 35:27.793
11 years
for credit card fraud

35:27.793 --> 35:30.128
because he bought
a PlayStation?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.630
â™ª tense music â™ª

35:31.630 --> 35:33.715
This won't
do anyone any good.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.385
Some of those are your cases,
your office.

35:36.385 --> 35:39.429
How did I miss it
for so long?

35:39.429 --> 35:41.640
You know,
all those middle class types

35:41.640 --> 35:43.141
walking out
of your courtroom free.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.270
All those Black and Latino kids
going upstate for 20 years.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.189
I am no racist.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.148
Oh, no. [chuckles]
That's selling you short.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.236
You're worse --
a racist and a profiteer.

35:54.403 --> 35:58.574
You want proof? Wait for it.
[clicks tongue]

35:58.574 --> 36:01.702
Baldinger Prison Systems.

36:01.702 --> 36:04.372
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

36:04.372 --> 36:06.248
There's no way
to reopen those cases.

36:06.248 --> 36:09.335
I can draw a straight line
to you and your partners,

36:09.335 --> 36:11.336
your offshore bank account,

36:11.336 --> 36:14.257
and even your little
girlfriend, Maribel Solarte,

36:14.257 --> 36:16.550
at your condo in Punta Cana.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.677
Theories and accusations.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.513
After I've spent a lifetime
on the bench,

36:21.513 --> 36:25.017
until I got splinters
in my ass and all for...

36:25.017 --> 36:27.311
a civil servant's wages.

36:27.311 --> 36:31.232
We both know they're not
just accusations, Your Honor.

36:31.232 --> 36:34.235
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

36:38.071 --> 36:39.364
What do you want?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.742
You will resign immediately

36:41.742 --> 36:43.702
for undisclosed
personal reasons.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.162
[pats arms]

36:45.162 --> 36:47.706
And there will be a little party
and tearful goodbyes,

36:47.706 --> 36:51.209
and you will stride off
into private practice.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.919
Or the FBI
could come in here

36:52.919 --> 36:56.048
and give you
a far different reception.

36:56.048 --> 36:58.301
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

36:58.301 --> 37:01.261
You...won't prosecute?

37:01.261 --> 37:03.805
No. You do it that way,

37:03.805 --> 37:06.600
and the Southern District
declines to prosecute.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.436
[scoffs] Because if we did,
you would dig

37:08.436 --> 37:13.274
those badger teeth and claws
of yours in and fight.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.734
It would take two years,
and you would go to jail,

37:15.734 --> 37:17.527
but the Southern District
believes

37:17.527 --> 37:23.116
that your swift departure would
be best for the justice system.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.368
Oh...

37:24.368 --> 37:26.870
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

37:26.870 --> 37:29.164
And shame on you.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.042
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

37:32.042 --> 37:35.379
[footsteps depart]

37:35.379 --> 37:38.924
[door creaks open,
telephone ringing in distance]

37:38.924 --> 37:40.842
[door closes]

37:40.842 --> 37:44.638
[footsteps approach]

37:44.638 --> 37:47.683
[sighs]

37:47.683 --> 37:49.685
Hi.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.562
Hi.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.315
-[sighs]
-How you holding up?

37:54.315 --> 37:56.608
[kisses, sniffles]

37:56.608 --> 37:59.361
Funeral arrangements
were a welcome distraction.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.196
[birds chirping]

38:01.196 --> 38:02.989
[clicks teeth]

38:02.989 --> 38:05.575
I brought a casserole,
just like it was the '50s.

38:10.373 --> 38:13.125
This Secret Santa project
looks overwhelming.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.085
[dish clatters]
-Do you need a hand?

38:15.085 --> 38:17.212
Help is literally
on the way.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.382
Lara's taking over
the whole operation.

38:19.382 --> 38:20.924
Oh. So good of her.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.968
She's been great.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.637
Both of them, really great.

38:28.724 --> 38:32.519
You're in
a...complicated position.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.897
[inhales deeply] Yeah.

38:35.897 --> 38:39.402
It was...hard on Donnie,

38:39.402 --> 38:41.362
not being able to tell you.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.822
-What do you mean?
[footsteps approach]

38:43.822 --> 38:47.451
I just mean his privacy,
you know.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.538
It meant a lot to him.

38:50.538 --> 38:52.497
Did other people know?

38:52.497 --> 38:54.249
Hey.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.168
Hey.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.711
I've got a big truck outside.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.798
-Oh, do you need me to move?
-If you wouldn't mind.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.926
It's so good of you to take over
the Secret Santa thing.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.764
Yeah. We were pretty close.

39:08.764 --> 39:10.558
And closer in troubled times.

39:10.558 --> 39:13.059
That's the true test
of friendship.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.811
Yes, it is.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.022
What are you doing here?

39:19.525 --> 39:22.486
[clicks teeth]
I'm saying hi to Walter,

39:22.486 --> 39:23.904
seeing if he needed
anything.

39:23.904 --> 39:26.448
He's taken care of.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.494
I see. Well, I figure,
at a time like this,

39:30.494 --> 39:32.746
the more the merrier.

39:32.746 --> 39:35.665
At a time like this,
a family pulls together.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.543
That's what Axe Capital is --
a family.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.504
One I'm part of, too.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.380
Of course you are.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.635
We're fine.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.804
[kisses]

39:48.804 --> 39:50.555
Thanks for the casserole.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.853
[footsteps depart]

39:56.853 --> 40:00.190
[heels clacking]

40:00.190 --> 40:03.568
[birds chirping]

40:03.568 --> 40:05.737
["Heaven Sent" playing]

40:05.737 --> 40:09.533
â™ª I tried my hardest
not to be â™ª

40:09.533 --> 40:14.120
â™ª I locked the door,
and I broke the key â™ª

40:14.120 --> 40:15.623
[bottle clinks]

40:15.623 --> 40:17.458
â™ª Why can't I sleep
through the night? â™ª

40:17.458 --> 40:19.209
Want company?

40:19.209 --> 40:22.254
No. I'd be no good.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.965
All right.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.800
You okay?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.051
Sure.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.970
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

40:29.970 --> 40:32.430
You and Donnie were close,

40:32.430 --> 40:36.184
especially
these last few months.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.436
â™ª I just wanna make... â™ª

40:38.436 --> 40:42.232
How long you figure it's been
since we've had a session?

40:42.232 --> 40:45.235
-We talk all the time.
-No, a real  session.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.446
â™ª It's a sign,
it's how I've always been â™ª

40:48.446 --> 40:49.823
â™ª Did you love me... â™ª

40:49.823 --> 40:52.659
Three and a half years.

40:52.659 --> 40:56.204
â™ª He was just my friend â™ª

40:56.204 --> 40:59.082
[chuckles]

40:59.082 --> 41:00.709
Will you come see me?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.794
â™ª Ah â™ª

41:02.794 --> 41:06.882
â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

41:06.882 --> 41:11.386
â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

41:11.386 --> 41:15.640
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:15.640 --> 41:19.394
â™ª Papa, you're the one
that taught me â™ª

41:19.394 --> 41:21.521
â™ª By his strap, he sought me â™ª

41:21.521 --> 41:25.275
â™ª And with his blood,
he bought me â™ª

41:25.275 --> 41:26.693
[rustling]
-â™ª Daddy â™ª

41:26.693 --> 41:28.696
â™ª You're the one
that claimed that â™ª

41:28.696 --> 41:30.447
â™ª He'd love me
through the flame â™ª

41:30.447 --> 41:33.534
â™ª Now why can't you
do the same? â™ª

41:33.534 --> 41:36.453
[rustling continues]
-â™ª I've been born again â™ª

41:36.453 --> 41:38.288
â™ª First was born in sin â™ª

41:38.288 --> 41:41.499
[tape clatters]
-â™ª Did you love me then? â™ª

41:41.499 --> 41:42.751
[front door closes]

41:42.751 --> 41:44.545
â™ª Did you love me then? â™ª

41:44.545 --> 41:45.754
[Bobby] Hey.

41:45.754 --> 41:47.797
Christmas coming
a little early this year?

41:47.797 --> 41:50.592
This is Donnie's
Secret Santa project.

41:50.592 --> 41:51.843
I took it on.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.387
-We're elves.
-Slave elves.

41:54.387 --> 41:55.847
Gordie.

41:55.847 --> 41:59.560
Pretty big job here, boys.
You want some help?

41:59.560 --> 42:00.644
What are you doing?

42:00.644 --> 42:02.354
I'll get a half a dozen interns
from the office.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.231
They'll knock this off in
no time. They're Ivy Leaguers.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.734
-[whispers] Yes.
-[Lara] Conference.

42:06.734 --> 42:08.610
You two keep wrapping.
Remember, there are

42:08.610 --> 42:12.322
more presents
in the other room.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.699
This is one of those
teachable moments

42:13.699 --> 42:14.741
that we talked about.

42:14.741 --> 42:16.618
The idea is that we do something
with our own hands

42:16.618 --> 42:19.537
to benefit the less fortunate,
as a family.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.666
Is this a teachable moment
for me or for the kids?

42:22.666 --> 42:24.501
[sighs]

42:24.501 --> 42:27.504
All right, I'll wrap.

42:27.504 --> 42:30.256
And, Bobby...

42:30.256 --> 42:32.175
I ran into Wendy
at Walter's today.

42:32.175 --> 42:33.385
And?

42:33.385 --> 42:35.470
She was probing Walter
for information.

42:35.470 --> 42:38.098
Is that right?

42:38.098 --> 42:40.600
It made be wonder about
her continuing value.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.229
We're vulnerable,
and so are they.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.732
I trust her.

42:46.732 --> 42:49.776
[indistinct conversations,
laughter]

42:49.776 --> 42:51.236
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]

42:51.236 --> 42:52.862
Thank you.

42:52.862 --> 42:55.031
-Your Honor.
-Counselor.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.784
-Mmm.
-You didn't have to come.

42:56.784 --> 42:58.702
[mouth full]
Oh, of course I did.

42:58.702 --> 43:00.662
Wouldn't be seemly
otherwise.

43:00.662 --> 43:03.624
Boy, you know what I love
about this cake?

43:03.624 --> 43:05.375
-What?
-Sour cream.

43:05.375 --> 43:07.628
It's just like my grandmother
used to make.

43:07.628 --> 43:10.422
Gives it a little...tang.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.800
-Yes, it does.
-Yeah.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.885
You like a little tang
every so often, don't you, Whit?

43:15.885 --> 43:18.221
-Sure, Chuck.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

43:18.221 --> 43:20.598
[Chuck]
It's a really nice crowd.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.767
I think I'll say
a few words.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.018
No, that won't be
necessary.

43:23.018 --> 43:25.020
I love to speak.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.688
-[Chuck] Uh...
[clinking bottle ]

43:26.688 --> 43:29.692
-Ladies and gentlemen?
[clinking continues]

43:29.692 --> 43:33.778
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment?

43:33.778 --> 43:36.281
Thank you.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.324
Hmm.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.703
Justice.

43:40.703 --> 43:44.330
Rooted in truth,
watered by tenacity,

43:44.330 --> 43:48.084
and flowering in wisdom.

43:48.084 --> 43:52.881
May be the single most beautiful
expression of humanity.

43:54.842 --> 43:59.304
For a man to dedicate his life
in its pursuit

43:59.304 --> 44:04.100
rings of a certain nobility.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.645
And this day we gather
to acknowledge that nobility

44:07.645 --> 44:13.861
in the Honorable Whit Wilcox.
[inhales deeply]

44:13.861 --> 44:17.197
Devoted servant of justice

44:17.197 --> 44:19.074
and one of its most

44:19.074 --> 44:22.577
industrious sentinels.

44:25.121 --> 44:29.250
-Congratulations, Judge Wilcox.
[pats arm]

44:29.250 --> 44:32.378
And thank you
for your noble service.

44:32.378 --> 44:36.717
-Mm.
-â™ª For... â™ª

44:36.717 --> 44:38.885
[all]
â™ª He's a jolly good fellow â™ª

44:38.885 --> 44:41.221
â™ª For he's a jolly good fellow â™ª

44:41.221 --> 44:44.933
â™ª For he's
a jolly good fellow â™ª

44:44.933 --> 44:47.310
â™ª Which nobody can... â™ª

44:47.310 --> 44:49.855
[singing fades]

44:49.855 --> 44:51.523
Hello, Judge.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.817
You're going to jail.

44:53.817 --> 44:55.068
You may even own it.

44:57.737 --> 45:00.990
[under breath]
You're a fucking  liar.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.076
I said the Southern  District
wouldn't prosecute.

45:03.076 --> 45:04.828
I can't speak for Eastern.

45:04.828 --> 45:07.622
-You'll be coming with us.
-[all murmuring]

45:07.622 --> 45:08.998
[male agent] You have the right
to remain silent.

45:08.998 --> 45:11.501
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

45:11.501 --> 45:12.710
in a court of law.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.839
Twenty-eight percent
of our goddamn fund

45:15.839 --> 45:16.840
by the time we dug ourselves

45:16.840 --> 45:18.216
-...out of the position.
[papers rustle]

45:18.216 --> 45:21.052
Was there ever even a real
takeover being considered?

45:21.052 --> 45:24.180
[scoffs]
Who cares? It's over.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.766
[elevator whirring, stops]

45:25.766 --> 45:27.392
How are we gonna explain
this to our investors?

45:27.392 --> 45:29.060
[papers rustle,
hand thuds on table]

45:29.060 --> 45:31.772
[Bobby] Nice space.

45:31.772 --> 45:34.649
Edgy.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.526
Mind if I take a seat?

45:36.526 --> 45:38.444
[inhales sharply]

45:38.444 --> 45:39.737
[exhales sharply]

45:41.865 --> 45:43.950
Going forward,
you might want to consider

45:43.950 --> 45:46.077
vetting your information
a little better.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.871
[Channing] Lesson learned.

45:47.871 --> 45:50.039
[sighs]

45:50.039 --> 45:51.374
I could take pleasure

45:51.374 --> 45:53.836
in watching you three
circle the drain,

45:53.836 --> 45:55.796
but I am a practical man.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.672
And there was a reason that
I hired and trained all of you

45:57.672 --> 45:59.174
in the first place.

45:59.174 --> 46:03.595
[Bobby] So...here's what
I'm prepared to do.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.680
I will seed Ionosphere --

46:05.680 --> 46:07.850
stupid fucking name,
by the way --

46:07.850 --> 46:11.311
with 250 million dollars.

46:11.311 --> 46:13.813
That should keep the lights on.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.440
You'll be required to sign

46:15.440 --> 46:17.901
non-compete
and non-solicitation agreements.

46:17.901 --> 46:21.738
We will enter into
a revenue share agreement.

46:21.738 --> 46:25.074
The current rate for seed money
is 20 to 25%,

46:25.074 --> 46:28.494
-...so why don't we call it 40?
-40?

46:28.494 --> 46:31.789
Swallow that and wash it down
with this.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.042
You will provide
total transparency.

46:34.042 --> 46:37.420
I want your trade files
sent to my office every night.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.047
There will be a limit

46:39.047 --> 46:42.467
on how much outside capital
you can raise.

46:42.467 --> 46:47.805
At no time can you manage
more than 999 million dollars.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.182
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

46:49.182 --> 46:51.018
There will be no buy-out
to eliminate

46:51.018 --> 46:52.644
the revenue share agreement

46:52.644 --> 46:54.395
and no lock-up on my money.

46:54.395 --> 46:57.482
I can pull the plug at any time.

46:57.482 --> 47:00.443
That's the deal.
No negotiation.

47:00.443 --> 47:04.948
I'm counting to five,
and then it's off the table.

47:04.948 --> 47:07.325
-One --
-We'll do it.

47:11.246 --> 47:12.873
[inhales sharply]

47:12.873 --> 47:16.834
â™ª pensive music â™ª

47:16.834 --> 47:18.879
Wise.

47:18.879 --> 47:22.006
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

47:22.006 --> 47:24.384
And I'd better see you
at the funeral.

47:24.384 --> 47:27.387
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

47:30.723 --> 47:33.893
[bottle clinking]

47:33.893 --> 47:35.520
[indistinct conversations]

47:35.520 --> 47:37.772
[smacks lips]

47:37.772 --> 47:39.900
[sighs]

47:39.900 --> 47:40.942
[chomping]

47:40.942 --> 47:44.320
[bottle thuds]
-[sighs heavily]

47:44.320 --> 47:47.115
[footsteps scuffle]

47:47.115 --> 47:50.994
I, uh, I don't go to funerals.

47:50.994 --> 47:53.871
I can't bring myself to.
I-I skip 'em.

47:53.871 --> 47:57.500
I send mountains of flowers
and food to the wake,

47:57.500 --> 48:00.712
convince myself
that's the right thing to do.

48:00.712 --> 48:04.049
If I were asked why, I'd say,

48:04.049 --> 48:06.050
"Well, we wanna remember him
how he was,"

48:06.050 --> 48:10.513
or some other bullshit.

48:10.513 --> 48:12.307
Truth?

48:12.307 --> 48:15.059
I like to keep moving so I don't
have to think about it.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.937
More truth?

48:16.937 --> 48:19.522
I'm not the type to grapple
with it all.

48:19.522 --> 48:22.442
But...

48:22.442 --> 48:25.611
There was no way that
I was gonna skip this one.

48:28.323 --> 48:31.451
Because Donnie...

48:31.451 --> 48:33.953
grappled with all of it.

48:33.953 --> 48:37.623
He was courage.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.877
And...hope.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.048
And his intelligence
and his kindness

48:45.048 --> 48:47.968
made me wanna be
all those things, too.

48:47.968 --> 48:49.886
As it did all of you.

48:54.849 --> 48:57.935
I am so angry that he's gone.

49:01.939 --> 49:05.068
So glad that while he was here,

49:05.068 --> 49:08.321
I was one of the lucky few
who knew him.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.369
I admired Donnie Caan.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.625
And I am proud to have
called him a friend.

49:20.625 --> 49:24.087
[wind blowing, leaves rustling]

49:24.087 --> 49:26.923
[cup rustles]

49:26.923 --> 49:28.508
[footsteps scuffle]

49:28.508 --> 49:31.803
[exhales]
Let's do this. Donnie.

49:31.803 --> 49:34.639
[all] To Donnie.

49:36.391 --> 49:37.725
[sips]

49:37.725 --> 49:40.603
[Bryan] Why you working
from home today?

49:40.603 --> 49:44.482
I went to a funeral
and got kicked out...

49:44.482 --> 49:46.151
by my wife.

49:48.111 --> 49:51.989
I needed the quiet.
[sighs]

49:53.491 --> 49:54.951
The Judge Wilcox arrest...

49:54.951 --> 49:56.786
Mm-hmm?

49:56.786 --> 49:58.955
-Slick move.
-Mm.

49:58.955 --> 50:00.123
[both chuckle softly]

50:00.123 --> 50:03.418
That wasn't it. It was
just the opener, right?

50:05.170 --> 50:08.381
You got rid of an impediment,
but that's not enough.

50:08.381 --> 50:11.008
You're putting in
your own blocker.

50:11.008 --> 50:14.179
You wanna put someone
in that seat --

50:14.179 --> 50:16.180
someone who'll owe you,
not someone who's compromised.

50:16.180 --> 50:20.227
Just a more...willing ear.

50:21.769 --> 50:23.563
[chuckles]

50:23.563 --> 50:24.730
The person
needs to be qualified.

50:24.730 --> 50:27.024
He or she
needs to check out

50:27.024 --> 50:29.527
gold stars
across the board.

50:29.527 --> 50:31.196
[sighs]

50:31.196 --> 50:32.613
It's a Senate appointment,
the Judiciary committee,

50:32.613 --> 50:37.285
so it won't be immediate,
but it won't be long either.

50:37.285 --> 50:40.246
Yeah, you're almost there.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.914
Hmm.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.377
Adam DeGiulio?

50:48.421 --> 50:50.423
And then he's out of your way
at the AG's office, too.

50:50.423 --> 50:55.095
And maybe he leaves a friendly
behind in his place.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.637
Wow.

50:56.637 --> 50:59.765
Don't get too excited
by how good it sounds.

50:59.765 --> 51:03.103
Everything's gotta fall
just  right. [chuckles]

51:03.103 --> 51:04.228
And the odds
of that happening --

51:04.228 --> 51:07.064
Still, you're playing
the game again. Clear-eyed.

51:07.064 --> 51:09.817
Oh, that I am.

51:09.817 --> 51:11.360
Drink?

51:11.360 --> 51:15.281
No. I'll -- I'll keep mine
clear, too.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.991
[pats arm]

51:16.991 --> 51:20.411
[wind blowing]

51:20.411 --> 51:23.414
[birds calling in distance]

51:34.342 --> 51:36.469
You all right?

51:36.469 --> 51:38.095
Sad.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.389
Yeah. Good guy.

51:40.389 --> 51:44.186
One of the few people at work
who were remotely interesting.

51:44.186 --> 51:45.728
Tell me about it.

51:46.854 --> 51:50.316
And...he was our gay guy.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.945
That make a difference?

51:53.945 --> 51:55.738
Yeah.

51:55.738 --> 51:58.574
These days,
it's great to have a gay.

52:00.701 --> 52:03.621
You are a complete
goddamn animal.

52:07.083 --> 52:09.919
[champagne sloshes]

52:09.919 --> 52:12.004
[bottle clinks]

52:12.004 --> 52:14.048
I ruined his life.

52:15.841 --> 52:16.884
Say again?

52:16.884 --> 52:20.263
[inhales deeply]
Donnie.

52:20.263 --> 52:23.015
I was able to patch him up,

52:23.015 --> 52:26.727
keep him in a game
that made him miserable.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.229
If I just...

52:28.229 --> 52:30.731
let him fail, get fired,
he would've been better off.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.358
He could've made the life
he wanted.

52:32.358 --> 52:33.818
That's kind of
a stretch, Wendy.

52:33.818 --> 52:35.319
Oh, he would've been
so much happier

52:35.319 --> 52:37.280
if he'd returned
to academia.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.781
Give me a break.

52:38.781 --> 52:42.410
College professors are broke
as fuck and bitter, too.

52:42.410 --> 52:44.371
They certainly don't leave
40 mil to their families

52:44.371 --> 52:46.581
when they knock off.

52:46.581 --> 52:49.375
Now, what...
[sighs]

52:49.375 --> 52:54.381
is really  going on,
Dr. Rhoades?

52:54.381 --> 52:56.424
Is it a little case
of projection?

52:56.424 --> 52:58.343
[bottle clinks]

52:58.343 --> 53:01.721
Donnie walked with 40?

53:01.721 --> 53:04.307
Hyperbole.

53:04.307 --> 53:06.393
Just making my point.

53:08.311 --> 53:11.273
Right.

53:11.273 --> 53:13.941
Worst part of my job,
I'll tell you that.

53:13.941 --> 53:16.819
-Ari.
-Hey, Bobby.

53:16.819 --> 53:20.407
Thank you, Dr. Gilbert,
for the excellent care,

53:20.407 --> 53:22.242
for trying so hard.

53:27.371 --> 53:30.082
Walter, we're gonna take off.

53:30.082 --> 53:31.375
[sighs]

53:31.375 --> 53:34.211
[lowered voice] A messenger's
gonna stop by tomorrow.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.921
You'll have all the info.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.840
Any problems,
you have the number, right?

53:37.840 --> 53:39.925
Yes.

53:39.925 --> 53:41.427
Thank you.

53:41.427 --> 53:45.390
I  should be thanking  you.

53:45.390 --> 53:48.851
I took him away from you.

53:48.851 --> 53:52.897
He should've been
with his family, with you.

53:52.897 --> 53:56.401
No. You pulled him
out of a dark well,

53:56.401 --> 53:58.819
made him himself again.

53:58.819 --> 54:00.696
Got him reaching for
that final piece of life

54:00.696 --> 54:04.533
instead of watching it go.
[chuckles]

54:04.533 --> 54:05.868
[whispers] Oh, honey.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.083
It was a good send-off.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.460
[sniffles]
It was very Donnie.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.711
[all chuckle]

54:15.711 --> 54:17.963
[sniffles]

54:17.963 --> 54:20.424
So nothing to worry about
on the Secret Santa front.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.677
I really couldn't have that
around the house.

54:22.677 --> 54:25.096
Donnie loved doing it
so much. [chuckles]

54:25.096 --> 54:28.475
He kept saying, "I just
wanna make it to Christmas

54:28.475 --> 54:31.936
so I can be Santa
one more time."

54:31.936 --> 54:33.438
He'd see them get the gifts

54:33.438 --> 54:37.274
and beam straight through
New Year's.

54:38.818 --> 54:41.445
He just didn't make it.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.287
Okay. I'll meet you
in the waiting room.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.330
Okay.

54:54.291 --> 54:55.584
[door creaks closed]

54:59.130 --> 55:01.298
Ari? How is he?

55:01.298 --> 55:03.426
It's not contained,
and it's spreading quickly.

55:03.426 --> 55:06.762
I'm not into the calendar game,
but...two, three months.

55:08.431 --> 55:10.517
That's a shame.

55:10.517 --> 55:12.101
He is a candidate for
a drug trial in Pittsburgh

55:12.101 --> 55:15.229
that's been yielding some
pretty interesting results.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.605
Such as?

55:16.605 --> 55:18.691
Slowing growth down,
buying time, really.

55:18.691 --> 55:20.651
How much?

55:20.651 --> 55:25.197
Three or four months more,
six.

55:25.197 --> 55:27.367
I can get him in,

55:27.367 --> 55:30.119
but it is
a pretty rigorous course.

55:30.119 --> 55:32.329
So...kind of rough

55:32.329 --> 55:34.373
for a guy who's been through
a lot already.

55:34.373 --> 55:37.126
It can be.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.464
Maybe we shouldn't
bring it up.

55:41.464 --> 55:43.591
You think? I...

55:43.591 --> 55:44.842
Well, I mean,

55:44.842 --> 55:47.386
what kind of quality of life
will he have?

55:51.682 --> 55:53.726
Best not to
bring it up then.

55:56.103 --> 55:57.354
[footsteps depart]

55:57.354 --> 55:59.732
[door opens]
-Yeah.

55:59.732 --> 56:01.901
â™ª tense music â™ª

56:01.901 --> 56:03.194
[door closes]

56:03.194 --> 56:06.113
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

56:17.459 --> 56:20.462
[Chumbawamba]
â™ª Oh, Danny Boy â™ª

56:20.462 --> 56:25.674
â™ª Danny Boy, Danny Boy â™ª

56:25.674 --> 56:28.595
â™ª I get knocked down,
but I get up again â™ª

56:28.595 --> 56:30.054
â™ª You're never gonna
keep me down â™ª

56:30.054 --> 56:33.057

57:16.267 --> 57:19.061
â™ª I get knocked down,

57:19.061 --> 57:21.021
â™ª You're never gonna

57:21.021 --> 57:23.774
â™ª I get knocked down,
but I get up again â™ª

57:23.774 --> 57:25.568
â™ª You're never gonna

57:25.568 --> 57:28.530

57:28.530 --> 57:29.989

57:29.989 --> 57:32.950

57:32.950 --> 57:34.577
