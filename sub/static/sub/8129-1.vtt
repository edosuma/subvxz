00:55.854 --> 00:57.988
I'm tellin' you for the last
time, get away from me.

00:58.056 --> 00:59.424
Get away from me!

00:59.491 --> 01:00.758
That's just the administration.

01:00.826 --> 01:02.126
It's causin' all your problems.

01:02.194 --> 01:03.894
Where do you think your
inflation comes from?

01:03.962 --> 01:06.331
I know where my inflation comes from.

01:06.398 --> 01:08.366
From the gas that you give me.

01:09.768 --> 01:11.469
What are you two fightin' about now?

01:11.537 --> 01:12.737
I ain't fightin'.

01:12.805 --> 01:14.239
He's the one that's doin' the fightin',

01:14.307 --> 01:15.840
all I'm doin' is talkin'.

01:15.908 --> 01:18.009
And all I'm sayin' is that
I shouldn't be puttin' on

01:18.077 --> 01:20.579
this anniversary party
which I cannot afford.

01:20.646 --> 01:22.414
And all I am saying is

01:22.481 --> 01:24.282
the reason you are uptight is because,

01:24.350 --> 01:26.117
a: Your union is about to go on strike--

01:26.185 --> 01:28.786
hold it. Hold it. I ain't
uptight about that strike.

01:28.854 --> 01:31.189
And b: Between the recession and inflation,

01:31.257 --> 01:33.558
this administration is
taking you to the cleaners.

01:33.626 --> 01:34.659
Oh, get away from me.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.094
You can't walk away from an argument!

01:36.161 --> 01:37.796
You've been pinchin' pennies for months,

01:37.863 --> 01:39.230
you're down to one cigar a day,

01:39.298 --> 01:40.932
and you are scared stiff about that strike.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.401
I ain't scared about that strike,
I ain't scared about nothin'.

01:43.469 --> 01:45.036
You are too scared.

01:47.172 --> 01:49.240
You're scared your union's
about to go on strike

01:49.308 --> 01:51.610
because of the high cost of
living that this administration

01:51.677 --> 01:54.012
promised to bring down 6 years ago.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.213
[Exclaiming]

01:56.782 --> 01:58.149
The only thing that scares me

01:58.217 --> 01:59.918
is the high cost of your appetite.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.953
If you listen to your president, you'd know

02:02.021 --> 02:03.955
that he had the answer to inflation.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.957
The country's got to produce more goods,

02:06.025 --> 02:07.826
then we gotta have little
more unemployment.

02:07.893 --> 02:09.526
So when there's more goods to buy

02:09.595 --> 02:11.395
and less people who can
afford to buy the goods,

02:11.463 --> 02:13.297
then the prices will come down.

02:23.242 --> 02:25.810
That is the stupidest damn
thing you've ever said.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.246
You watch your language,

02:28.314 --> 02:29.347
don't be swearin' in the house.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.182
Oh, come on, arch.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.350
What's the difference?

02:32.418 --> 02:33.951
Daddy!

02:34.020 --> 02:35.987
What is the difference between
this house and the white house?

02:36.055 --> 02:37.688
What are you bringin'
up the white house for?

02:37.756 --> 02:40.125
It's a fact, arch, Nixon swore.

02:40.192 --> 02:43.061
Listen. Now, I say this for the man.

02:43.128 --> 02:46.330
He never swore in the house
in front of his family.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.032
Only with the people workin' for him,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.902
because they're Germans, you
gotta swear at Germans.

02:56.274 --> 03:00.344
Daddy, swearing's just a
sign of a small mind.

03:00.412 --> 03:01.913
Ah, shut the hell up.

03:03.582 --> 03:05.750
I don't see how you can
keep defending the guy.

03:05.818 --> 03:09.087
I mean, he had to resign because
he lied about the cover-up.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.655
He did not lie.

03:10.722 --> 03:12.356
He forgot to tell the truth.

03:15.994 --> 03:17.795
That's a big difference, huh?

03:17.863 --> 03:19.697
You get away from me.

03:19.765 --> 03:21.166
But as long as you're still with me,

03:21.233 --> 03:22.633
let me tell you somethin' else.

03:22.701 --> 03:23.868
There's a lot of presidents

03:23.936 --> 03:25.603
done a lot worse than president Nixon.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.205
Like who?

03:27.273 --> 03:29.107
Oh, like a lot of them, like,
uh, well, for instance,

03:29.174 --> 03:31.610
the guy-- that guy-- that
guy-- the guy, that, uh,

03:31.677 --> 03:33.544
went into the capitol,
and under the dome and

03:33.612 --> 03:35.613
was sellin' the teapots on the side.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.752
You mean Harding?

03:40.820 --> 03:43.955
That's right, Alexander e. Harding.

03:45.857 --> 03:48.326
And nobody said a word to
him because in them days,

03:48.394 --> 03:50.261
people have respect for
what do you call, uh,

03:50.329 --> 03:52.330
executive's privileges.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.999
Daddy, you better try to get
in a good mood for this party.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.601
Oh, never mind my mood, little girl,

03:56.668 --> 03:59.104
just keep hangin' your steamers over there.

03:59.171 --> 04:02.207
You're the one that got me into
this whole expensive party here.

04:02.274 --> 04:04.409
Made me go out and buy your
mother an engagement ring

04:04.477 --> 04:06.377
after she went 26 years without one.

04:07.546 --> 04:08.679
Did you get it?

04:08.747 --> 04:10.715
Yeah, yeah, here it is, right here.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.150
Oh, it's beautiful.

04:13.218 --> 04:16.620
It ought to be beautiful. Cost me $85.

04:16.689 --> 04:19.290
Wow, looks like it cost more than that.

04:19.291 --> 04:23.594
What? Listen, it's a $229 ring.

04:23.662 --> 04:26.130
Spike waterman's old lady
didn't need it anymore.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.967
She went on one of them screwball diets,

04:30.035 --> 04:33.137
all the fat come off of her
behind and went into her fingers.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.444
Michael, will you please help me over here?

04:40.512 --> 04:41.846
Yeah, yeah, sure.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.215
Daddy, you really think
you're goin' on strike, huh?

04:44.283 --> 04:45.917
Well, I don't know, if some of them

04:45.985 --> 04:48.386
young hot-heads down the
plant get their way.

04:48.453 --> 04:50.087
I don't know what these guys want.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.956
They've been askin' for
staggered work shifts,

04:52.057 --> 04:54.725
lounges with pictures
on the wall, and books.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.795
They wanna turn a factory
into a house of pleasure.

04:57.863 --> 05:00.398
They don't wanna work,
they're a bunch of fairies.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.602
Daddy, people should be
treated with respect.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.005
Listen, little girl,
respect is for the dead.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.706
The living need dough.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.547
Sometimes, you got to strike.

05:15.614 --> 05:18.315
Ah, don't be tellin' me what I gotta do.

05:18.383 --> 05:21.052
I'm an old trade union man
long before you was born.

05:21.119 --> 05:22.987
Let me tell you, there's
a right way to strike,

05:23.055 --> 05:24.288
and a wrong way to strike.

05:24.356 --> 05:26.824
And the right way to
strike is don't strike.

05:27.726 --> 05:29.126
What?

05:29.194 --> 05:30.762
That's the way it is, you
gotta threaten to strike.

05:30.829 --> 05:33.230
You see, you gotta play the
rules of the bargaining game.

05:33.298 --> 05:35.199
Now, you ask the bosses
for more than you know

05:35.267 --> 05:36.534
they're willin' to give you.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.069
Then the bosses come
back and they offer you

05:38.136 --> 05:39.938
less than they know you're willin' to take.

05:40.005 --> 05:41.873
And you meet someplace in the middle,

05:41.941 --> 05:43.641
and you compromise each other.

05:44.710 --> 05:45.944
And as for you...

05:46.011 --> 05:47.011
[Blowing]

05:48.413 --> 05:50.281
Stick 'em up everybody.

05:50.348 --> 05:51.883
Aw, gee!

05:51.951 --> 05:53.150
What is that?

05:53.218 --> 05:55.019
It's a party favor.

05:55.087 --> 05:59.090
Now watch, I pull the
trigger and it goes "pop".

05:59.925 --> 06:01.392
I mean, "bang".

06:02.828 --> 06:04.128
Dingbat.

06:06.865 --> 06:08.066
I'll give you a hand, ma.

06:08.133 --> 06:10.101
Oh, thanks, Mike.

06:10.669 --> 06:12.269
Oh, my!

06:12.337 --> 06:15.673
The decorations look beautiful, Gloria.

06:15.741 --> 06:17.008
Thanks, ma.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.242
[Phone ringing]

06:18.310 --> 06:19.443
I'll get it.

06:21.279 --> 06:22.480
Hello.

06:23.315 --> 06:24.381
Oh, yes, he's here.

06:24.449 --> 06:25.883
May I tell him who's calling, please?

06:25.951 --> 06:27.518
Who's that on the phone, little girl?

06:27.586 --> 06:30.554
Just a minute. It's a Mr. Ted bartlett.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.624
Ted bartlett, that's the
president of my union.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.592
Give me the phone. Give
me-- give me the phone.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.460
Give--give-- give me the...

06:36.528 --> 06:39.163
W-will you give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

06:39.231 --> 06:40.397
Get outta here.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.102
Yeah.

06:45.904 --> 06:48.172
A. Bunker speaking, yeah.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.640
Yes, Mr. bartlett.

06:49.708 --> 06:50.908
How are you?

06:52.110 --> 06:54.179
Aw, get outta there, stretch Cunningham.

06:54.246 --> 06:56.480
I know your voice.

06:56.548 --> 06:59.584
My, I hope that ain't bad news.

06:59.651 --> 07:02.453
You're really worried about
a strike, aren't you, ma?

07:02.521 --> 07:05.256
Oh, yeah, and I hope it don't happen.

07:05.324 --> 07:07.391
Still, I don't know how we'll manage

07:07.459 --> 07:09.660
if Archie don't get more money.

07:09.728 --> 07:12.730
I can't figure it out, Gloria.

07:12.797 --> 07:14.298
20 years ago,

07:14.366 --> 07:18.636
Archie was earnin' a lot less,
and we was eatin' a lot more.

07:18.704 --> 07:21.205
And then, I always had somethin' left over

07:21.273 --> 07:23.274
to put in the savings bank.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.410
Now there ain't hardly
nothin' left in there.

07:26.478 --> 07:28.946
And I got nothin' to put in.

07:29.013 --> 07:33.117
I don't know how long the bank
can afford to go on like this.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.154
(Archie) Aw, whoopy-doo!

07:37.222 --> 07:39.423
Hey, everybody! Good news, Edith!

07:39.491 --> 07:41.325
Bring my beer. Whoop-Dee-doo.

07:41.393 --> 07:43.861
[All exclaiming]

07:43.928 --> 07:45.829
Edith, you know who that was on the phone?

07:45.897 --> 07:47.298
Should I guess?

07:47.366 --> 07:49.400
No, sit down.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.436
It was stretch Cunningham. He was
calling me about the strike.

07:52.504 --> 07:55.640
He was usin' the executive's
toilet at work.

07:55.707 --> 07:58.643
He called to tell you
he went to the toilet?

07:58.711 --> 08:01.446
The executive toilet, meathead.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.548
See, he was up in the
office part of the plant,

08:03.615 --> 08:05.650
so he figured, well, as
long as he was up there,

08:05.717 --> 08:06.818
why not?

08:08.286 --> 08:09.887
Why not what?

08:12.224 --> 08:15.225
Why not see how the other half, uh, lives?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.263
So he was sittin' in there
and all of a sudden,

08:19.330 --> 08:21.832
in comes Jim Sanders,
the personnel manager,

08:21.900 --> 08:24.435
and the big boss, old
man pendergast himself.

08:24.503 --> 08:27.905
Oh, my, I hope stretch
didn't get caught in there.

08:27.973 --> 08:30.041
No, no, no, no, they didn't even see him.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.542
See, he picked his feet up.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.549
He heard Sanders say to pendergast,

08:38.616 --> 08:41.085
"Mr. pendergast, you think
there's gonna be a strike?"

08:41.153 --> 08:42.785
And pendergast said to Sanders,

08:42.854 --> 08:44.655
"no, there ain't gonna be no strike

08:44.723 --> 08:46.891
because we can't afford no strike."

08:46.959 --> 08:48.326
[All cheering]

08:48.393 --> 08:50.894
That's great, arch. Terrific news.

08:50.962 --> 08:53.297
Gee, I just hope it's true.

08:53.365 --> 08:56.634
Certainly, it's true. Men
never lie in toilets.

08:58.403 --> 09:00.638
In toilets, everything is out in the open.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.341
Well, now aren't you glad

09:04.409 --> 09:06.944
I talked you into having your
wedding anniversary party?

09:07.012 --> 09:09.146
Sure I'm glad now that there's
somethin' to celebrate.

09:09.214 --> 09:10.982
In fact, Edith, you know,

09:11.049 --> 09:13.284
I think I'm gonna run down the corner
and buy myself some more cigars.

09:13.351 --> 09:15.086
You wanna come, meathead?
We can finish the fight.

09:15.153 --> 09:16.920
Yeah, all right.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.357
Michael, will you please stay here and
help me finish with the decorations?

09:19.424 --> 09:21.025
Everybody will be here in about half hour.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.526
That's why I'm leaving you, Gloria.

09:22.594 --> 09:24.295
You're gonna do it much better without me.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.163
(Archie) ? there ain't gonna be no strike ?

09:26.231 --> 09:27.931
? there ain't gonna be
no strike, no strike ?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.201
? 'cause there ain't gonna be no strike ?

09:39.144 --> 09:41.345
Oh, my! What a relief.

09:41.413 --> 09:44.849
Now maybe, your father will
get a good night's sleep.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.750
Oh, hasn't daddy been sleepin', ma?

09:46.819 --> 09:47.852
Oh, no.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.254
I can always tell when he's sleepin'

09:50.322 --> 09:52.690
'cause he snores like this.

09:52.757 --> 09:55.193
[Snoring]

09:55.260 --> 09:57.028
[Gibbering]

09:58.496 --> 10:00.631
What's he do when he's not sleeping?

10:00.766 --> 10:02.633
He don't snore.

10:02.701 --> 10:04.602
[Doorbell ringing] Oh, I'll get it.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.070
That's probably Louise.

10:06.137 --> 10:09.240
She's makin' a cake for the party.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.474
Is this the bunker's residence?

10:10.542 --> 10:12.042
Yeah. Telegram.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.011
Oh, thank you.

10:14.746 --> 10:17.848
Oh my, look, a telegram.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.450
Go ahead, ma. Open it.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.953
Oh, no. It says bunker. It
might be for your father.

10:23.888 --> 10:25.589
Ma, your name's bunker, too.

10:25.657 --> 10:27.624
It's probably a happy anniversary wire.

10:27.693 --> 10:28.759
Go on, open it.

10:28.827 --> 10:32.096
Oh, all right. If you say so.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.864
I'll just read my half.

10:37.435 --> 10:38.635
[Gasping]

10:42.074 --> 10:44.041
I shouldn't have opened it.

10:44.142 --> 10:45.876
Why not?

10:45.944 --> 10:48.346
It's from your father's union.

10:48.413 --> 10:51.382
He's gotta go on strike on Monday.

10:52.517 --> 10:54.452
But that's not what daddy just said.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.222
I know. But he was wrong, Gloria.

10:58.289 --> 11:01.359
Men do tell lies in toilets.

11:12.304 --> 11:15.506
? Pack up all my cares and woe ?

11:15.574 --> 11:18.609
? here I go, singing low

11:18.677 --> 11:23.548
? bye bye blackbird

11:23.615 --> 11:26.450
? where somebody waits for me ?

11:26.518 --> 11:29.753
? sugar's sweet, so is he

11:29.821 --> 11:31.355
? bye bye blackbird

11:31.423 --> 11:32.623
ma.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.458
You can't stay in the kitchen all night.

11:34.526 --> 11:37.361
Gloria, I wonder what's
keepin' Mike and Archie.

11:37.429 --> 11:39.463
Oh, they probably just stopped off

11:39.531 --> 11:42.233
at kelsey's for a beer and
the rest of their argument.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.368
Gloria, maybe I was wrong.

11:44.436 --> 11:46.837
Maybe, I better show Archie the telegram

11:46.905 --> 11:48.072
when he gets back.

11:48.139 --> 11:50.874
No, ma, your first instinct was right.

11:50.942 --> 11:52.176
You mean,

11:52.244 --> 11:54.212
if I tell him about the strike,

11:54.279 --> 11:56.146
it'll spoil the party?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.115
I mean, if you tell him about the strike,

11:58.183 --> 11:59.916
there won't be any party.

11:59.984 --> 12:01.252
Now, ma, come on.

12:01.319 --> 12:02.520
Let's have a good time, ok?

12:02.587 --> 12:03.621
All right.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.389
Come on, Louise. We both can sing.

12:05.457 --> 12:07.158
(Both) ? I make my bed

12:07.225 --> 12:09.360
? and light the light

12:09.427 --> 12:11.395
? I'll arrive

12:11.463 --> 12:13.497
? late tonight

12:13.565 --> 12:16.433
? blackbird

12:16.501 --> 12:19.803
? bye bye

12:19.871 --> 12:21.205
[exclaims]

12:29.281 --> 12:30.747
Oh, ma.

12:30.815 --> 12:32.816
Don't look like that. You gotta cheer up.

12:32.884 --> 12:34.885
If daddy comes home and
sees you lookin' like this,

12:34.952 --> 12:36.420
he'll suspect something.

12:36.488 --> 12:37.721
Smile!

12:37.789 --> 12:39.490
I'll try.

12:42.527 --> 12:45.196
Wait a second, arch, you can't tell her.

12:45.263 --> 12:48.031
Don't tell me what I can't do.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.971
I never got stuck in a door in my life

12:54.039 --> 12:57.240
until my daughter married you.

12:57.308 --> 12:59.643
Don't ever come through a
doorway with me again.

12:59.711 --> 13:01.612
Arch, arch, wait a second, wait a second.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.681
What if we hadn't run
into Dutch kreeger, huh?

13:03.748 --> 13:06.216
And what if Dutch kreeger hadn't
told us that the strike was on?

13:06.284 --> 13:07.785
And what if your grandmother had wheels?

13:07.853 --> 13:08.886
Then she'd be a bike,

13:08.954 --> 13:11.722
and you could pedal away from here.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.491
Think about those other people in there.

13:13.558 --> 13:16.193
You invited them over just so
you could give ma the ring.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.563
I can't give her no $229 ring
with a strike comin' on.

13:19.631 --> 13:21.999
All right, all right, go ahead,
go in there and tell her,

13:22.067 --> 13:24.434
ruin the few happy hours
that she might be havin',

13:24.502 --> 13:25.569
spoil the whole party.

13:25.637 --> 13:26.871
That should make you feel real good.

13:26.938 --> 13:28.072
Leave me alone, will you?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.539
Just you leave me alone.

13:30.742 --> 13:32.376
[All chattering]

13:33.044 --> 13:34.578
Oh, geez.

13:35.713 --> 13:37.782
She's in there all smiles.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.287
You're right, meathead.

13:43.354 --> 13:45.756
How am I gonna go out there
and throw cold water

13:45.823 --> 13:48.025
in that happy face that don't know nothing?

13:50.562 --> 13:52.429
All right, come on with me.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.531
And try to look cheerful
yourself, will you?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.301
You look like one of that
pallberries at a funeral.

13:57.368 --> 13:58.569
Wait.

13:58.637 --> 14:02.473
Wait. Let me go through
the door first, please.

14:07.412 --> 14:08.912
[Inaudible]

14:09.780 --> 14:10.848
Uh, in the refrigerator.

14:10.915 --> 14:11.949
Here?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.117
See you, arch.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.556
You hidin', Mr. bunker?

14:20.592 --> 14:22.426
You stay away from me, too.

14:22.994 --> 14:25.195
[All chattering]

14:25.263 --> 14:26.364
(Archie) Hey, Edith.

14:26.431 --> 14:27.465
Oh, Archie, you're back.

14:27.532 --> 14:29.367
Yeah. You havin' a good time, huh, Edith?

14:29.434 --> 14:30.468
Oh, yeah.

14:30.535 --> 14:31.869
Yeah, yeah, you see that?

14:32.704 --> 14:34.038
What the hell is that?

14:34.105 --> 14:35.072
I mean...

14:35.139 --> 14:36.440
Don't tell me what to do.

14:36.507 --> 14:39.176
Archie, you missed a beautiful song.

14:39.243 --> 14:41.579
Irene, do <i>blackbird</i> again.

14:41.646 --> 14:42.746
Oh, wait a minute, Irene.

14:42.814 --> 14:44.147
Oh, never mind, uh, blackbirds,

14:44.216 --> 14:45.782
uh, play somethin' white.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.255
Play <i>we're in the money,</i> <i>you know?</i>

14:51.322 --> 14:53.690
? We're in the money we're in the money ?

14:53.758 --> 14:55.559
No, no, wait a minute, no, don't play that.

14:55.626 --> 14:57.494
That's no good.

14:57.562 --> 14:59.763
Uh, well, play somethin'
that goes with Edith here.

14:59.831 --> 15:02.566
Play, uh, you know, w-what is that, umm...

15:02.633 --> 15:05.035
Uh, <i>ain't she sweet,</i> <i>you remember that one?</i>

15:05.103 --> 15:08.138
(All singing) ? ain't she sweet

15:08.206 --> 15:11.041
? see her walking down that street ?

15:11.109 --> 15:14.544
? now I asked you very confidentially ?

15:14.612 --> 15:16.480
? ain't she sweet you
havin' a good time, Edith?

15:16.547 --> 15:18.249
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

15:18.316 --> 15:20.284
? Ain't she nice

15:20.351 --> 15:22.186
? look her over once or twice ?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.421
Hey, Edith. Don't sing, just have fun.

15:26.324 --> 15:29.260
? Ain't she nice I wanna wish
you a happy anniversary, Edith.

15:29.327 --> 15:31.896
Oh, thank you, Mr. munson.

15:31.963 --> 15:33.764
26 years with Archie,

15:33.832 --> 15:36.033
you sure did some woman a big favor.

15:39.137 --> 15:42.205
Oh, thank you.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.709
Gloria, what woman did he mean?

15:47.044 --> 15:50.180
Uh, ma, I--I think we need
some more sandwiches.

15:50.248 --> 15:51.382
Oh, yeah.

15:53.785 --> 15:56.654
George, don't just stand here like a stick.

15:56.721 --> 15:59.256
Mingle around, talk with people.

15:59.324 --> 16:00.524
Why should I talk to them?

16:00.592 --> 16:02.626
I don't even feel like talkin' to you.

16:04.329 --> 16:05.762
Hey, uh...

16:05.830 --> 16:07.398
Hey, Edith, I got somethin' to tell you.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.966
Oh, yeah.

16:09.033 --> 16:10.534
All right, Edith.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.069
Uh, Edith.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.837
I--I got somethin' to tell you.

16:13.905 --> 16:15.539
Oh, is that so?

16:15.607 --> 16:19.009
Will you stand still? It's
like talkin' to a moth.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.780
I'm--I'm sorry, Archie.

16:23.848 --> 16:25.816
What do you wanna tell me?

16:25.883 --> 16:28.852
Well, it's just... Edith, it...

16:28.920 --> 16:30.854
Are you havin' a good time?

16:30.922 --> 16:34.058
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Are you?

16:34.125 --> 16:35.526
Yeah, look at me.

16:38.629 --> 16:40.364
That's nice.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.866
Oh, I better put these sandwiches in there.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.901
Yeah, put the sandwiches in there, Edith.

16:44.969 --> 16:46.170
And have fun, you hear?

16:46.237 --> 16:48.838
Oh, Mike, would you pass
these sandwiches around?

16:48.906 --> 16:52.176
No, no, that's like askin' the
elephant to pass the peanuts.

16:55.547 --> 16:56.846
Ah, look at this.

16:56.914 --> 16:58.615
Don't be rootin' under the pile.

16:58.683 --> 17:00.016
Can't you take what's on top?

17:00.085 --> 17:02.486
Can't you be indelicate for a change?

17:02.554 --> 17:04.555
Irene, play another song, huh?

17:04.622 --> 17:07.191
Ok. But when are you gonna
cut the anniversary cake?

17:07.258 --> 17:09.059
Oh, all in due time. In due time.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.962
You know, like the good book
says, "patience is a virgin".

17:14.932 --> 17:17.000
Help yourself to a sandwich here, Louise.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.602
Oh, thank you, Archie.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.604
Hey, bunker.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.006
How come you're giving this party?
You about to go on strike.

17:23.075 --> 17:26.009
Oh, dummy up on that strike
stuff, huh, Jefferson.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.179
Who said anything about
goin' on strike here?

17:28.246 --> 17:29.413
Oh, not me.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.250
Yeah. There ain't gonna be no strike.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.652
Listen, the bosses can't
get along without us.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.588
So they know, they gotta divvy up with us.

17:37.655 --> 17:38.989
See, that's the trouble with you people.

17:39.056 --> 17:40.123
You always think that--

17:40.191 --> 17:41.258
hold it, hold it, hold it.

17:41.325 --> 17:43.494
Who are you callin' "you people"?

17:43.561 --> 17:45.295
You people are "you people".

17:50.402 --> 17:52.602
I'm talkin' about your unions

17:52.671 --> 17:55.439
askin' for higher wages
. That's bad for the country.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.774
Hey, now, if it's bad for the country,

17:56.841 --> 17:59.142
how come you raised the
prices on the cleaning store?

17:59.210 --> 18:00.244
He done that?

18:00.312 --> 18:01.878
He did on the white clothes.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.120
That figures, Jefferson.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.625
You know something, Lionel.

18:14.692 --> 18:17.227
You're the reason we never
had a second child.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.034
Hey, Archie, I'm glad you don't
have to go out on strike.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.836
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:25.903 --> 18:27.538
'Cause I won't be able to let
you drive the cab for a while.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.939
Huh?

18:29.006 --> 18:31.908
You mean Archie can't moonlight no more?

18:31.976 --> 18:34.077
That's right, Edith
. Nothin' personal, arch.

18:34.145 --> 18:36.213
But I'm gonna have to drive
the swing shift myself.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.414
Things being what they are,

18:37.482 --> 18:39.383
I gotta get every cent
I can lay my hands on.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.719
Gee, that's an awful kick
in the head, munson.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.320
Sorry, arch. But it could be a lot worse.

18:43.387 --> 18:45.589
You could be out on strike, and
you wouldn't get your raise.

18:45.656 --> 18:47.457
Isn't that right, Edith? Oh, right.

18:47.525 --> 18:48.658
No hard feelings, arch.

18:48.727 --> 18:49.793
Oh, no, no, munson.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.062
Why don't you go over there and sing?

18:52.130 --> 18:53.263
Oh, Archie.

18:53.331 --> 18:54.932
Oh, forget about that.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.168
I don't care if I don't drive his cab.

18:57.235 --> 18:59.102
I'll have more time to myself, Edith.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.038
I'll be able to perfect my bowling.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.541
Archie, there's somethin' I gotta tell you.

19:03.608 --> 19:06.109
No, no, no, save it,
save it, save it, Edith.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.646
There's somethin' much more
important I gotta do right now.

19:08.713 --> 19:11.048
All of yous, over here. All of yous now.

19:11.115 --> 19:12.849
Hey, hold it down, hold it down.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.252
Just for 2 or 3 instances over here, huh?

19:15.320 --> 19:18.455
I got a little announcement
I gotta announce now.

19:18.523 --> 19:20.457
As yous all know, Edith and me

19:20.525 --> 19:22.893
are married 26 years today.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.828
[All cheering]

19:26.431 --> 19:28.365
Do you have to be eatin' during this?

19:30.234 --> 19:32.636
But 27 years ago,

19:32.704 --> 19:35.339
Edith and me got engaged to
be married, right, Edith?

19:35.407 --> 19:36.973
Right. Yeah.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.075
You know when a guy asks
a girl to get married,

19:39.143 --> 19:41.011
that's the highest compliment he can pay.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.446
And it's usually the last one, too.

19:46.484 --> 19:49.286
Hey don't help me there, Mrs. "j", huh?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.954
Well, when I asked Edith to marry me,

19:51.022 --> 19:53.190
I didn't have the money to
afford an engagement ring.

19:53.257 --> 19:55.893
But I said to her, "one day. One day."

19:55.961 --> 19:57.360
And as you know, Edith,

19:57.428 --> 19:59.630
I always keep my promises, see.

19:59.698 --> 20:03.033
So now, this here is the day,

20:03.101 --> 20:04.267
and here we are.

20:04.335 --> 20:07.004
[All exclaiming] Oh, Archie!

20:07.505 --> 20:08.639
Hey, now.

20:08.706 --> 20:10.373
Hold out that finger, Edith.

20:10.441 --> 20:12.442
Put it right on there. There.

20:12.577 --> 20:13.977
Now, ain't that nice?

20:14.579 --> 20:17.848
Oh, Archie.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.887
Oh.

20:23.954 --> 20:25.689
Oh, oh!

20:27.692 --> 20:29.827
Relax. I'll take care of that. Don't worry.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.463
Hey, tears of happiness, folks.
Tears of happiness.

20:32.530 --> 20:33.931
The woman's delirious.

20:37.902 --> 20:39.436
Made you happy, huh, Edith?

20:39.504 --> 20:40.838
Archie,

20:40.905 --> 20:43.973
that's the nicest thing
you ever done for me.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.542
I know that, Edith.

20:48.779 --> 20:50.613
It's a beautiful ring.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.948
Oh, that ought to be.

20:52.016 --> 20:54.517
That's a whole quarter of a carat there.

20:54.619 --> 20:56.053
Oh, you don't have to cry no more.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.587
You can start feelin' better now.

20:57.655 --> 20:59.056
Hey, you wanna kiss me again?

20:59.123 --> 21:00.490
No!

21:02.460 --> 21:06.029
I ain't cryin' about the ring.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.165
Then, what are you cryin' 'cause of?

21:08.732 --> 21:09.899
This.

21:12.803 --> 21:15.038
Now where did you get that?

21:15.106 --> 21:18.808
It came while you was out.
You better read it.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.678
I don't have to read it, Edith.

21:20.745 --> 21:22.212
I know what's in there.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.148
You know?

21:24.215 --> 21:27.651
Well, then, how come you was
having such a good time?

21:27.718 --> 21:30.320
I done all that because of you, Edith.

21:30.388 --> 21:32.322
And you knew all the time.

21:32.390 --> 21:34.457
I was out there all night long

21:34.525 --> 21:37.161
killin' myself bein' happy.

21:37.228 --> 21:39.062
Why did you put me through that?

21:41.031 --> 21:44.334
I'm sorry, Archie.

21:44.401 --> 21:47.771
I don't mind if you wanna take this back.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.472
Oh, no! Edith!

21:49.540 --> 21:51.241
Come on, would you? Here.

21:51.308 --> 21:53.576
That's your ring there.
Edith, you keep that.

21:53.644 --> 21:56.913
That's yours, that's yours.

21:56.981 --> 21:58.915
Anyway, what would I get for it?

22:00.752 --> 22:02.418
Ma, you all right?

22:02.486 --> 22:04.855
Yeah, I'm fine, Gloria.

22:04.922 --> 22:06.489
Daddy? Yeah, yeah, fine, fine.

22:06.557 --> 22:08.491
I suppose she knows all about this.

22:08.559 --> 22:10.493
I suppose everybody out
there knows all about it.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.929
Oh, no, no. Just Mike and Gloria.

22:12.997 --> 22:14.297
When are you comin' out?

22:14.365 --> 22:16.166
Everybody is waitin' for
you to cut the cake.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.168
(Both) We'll be right there, Gloria.

22:18.236 --> 22:19.903
Ok.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.739
Come on, let's go back
to the party, Archie.

22:22.807 --> 22:23.807
W-w-wait--

22:23.875 --> 22:25.375
it'll make us both feel better.

22:25.442 --> 22:28.444
Wait a minute, Edith. I
gotta tell you something.

22:28.512 --> 22:31.181
What with this strike comin'
on, and all the inflation,

22:31.249 --> 22:33.250
cost of livin', I mean,

22:33.318 --> 22:36.019
things could get very tough.

22:36.087 --> 22:38.855
I know, Archie.

22:38.923 --> 22:42.859
But we'll make out all right.
We always have.

22:42.927 --> 22:45.429
There ain't nothin' to be afraid of.

22:45.497 --> 22:49.266
Remember what president Roosevelt said.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.534
What did he say?

22:51.603 --> 22:56.339
He said, "there ain't nothin'
to fear, but fear itself."

22:56.407 --> 22:58.475
Oh, yeah.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.911
But he was workin' when he said it.

23:10.721 --> 23:13.923
(Guests) ? let a smile be your umbrella ?

23:13.991 --> 23:17.127
? on a rainy

23:17.195 --> 23:20.597
? rainy day

23:20.664 --> 23:24.367
? and if your sweety cries

23:24.435 --> 23:26.570
? just tell her

23:26.637 --> 23:29.872
? that a smile will always pay ?

23:38.849 --> 23:40.717
How was the picketing today?

23:40.784 --> 23:43.386
Oh, geez. It was lousy...

23:43.454 --> 23:45.422
<i>(Male announcer)</i> <i>Be sure

23:45.490 --> 23:47.157

23:47.225 --> 23:49.993

23:50.060 --> 23:53.162
Oh, geez, they gave me the
biggest sign of all to carry.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.766
A big 4 by 8 with a barn door at the top

23:55.833 --> 23:57.200
that said, "unfair".

23:59.270 --> 24:00.370
And look at this.

24:00.437 --> 24:02.806
Oh, how'd you get that spot?

24:02.874 --> 24:04.641
A kid threw a tangerine at me.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.790
