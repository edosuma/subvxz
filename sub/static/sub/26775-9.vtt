00:03.080 --> 00:04.069
Brianna?

00:04.210 --> 00:05.245
What are you doing here?

00:05.340 --> 00:06.455
Looking for you.

00:06.630 --> 00:07.699
That wasn ’t the plan.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.620
I didn't know how to tell you
that I love you.

00:09.710 --> 00:10.790
Come with me.

00:12.010 --> 00:12.999
You'll marry me?

00:13.130 --> 00:14.131
Yes.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.750
I found the same obituary.

00:17.890 --> 00:19.096
And you o’io’n ’t tell me?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.169
Screw you!

00:20.520 --> 00:22.806
- Maybe I should just go back.
- Maybe you should.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.478
Darling, perhaps ye'll change my luck.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.105
It looks //7(e
one my mother had.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.309
Where did you get this?

00:35.450 --> 00:37.156
How much money do you want for it?

00:37.910 --> 00:39.070
But perhaps you could earn it.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.149
Please...

00:43.330 --> 00:44.570
I pay for my pleasures.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.832
Sing me a song

00:49.920 --> 00:52.969
Of a /ass that is gone

00:53.050 --> 00:55.883
Say, could that /ass

00:55.970 --> 00:58.461
Be 1'?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.767
Merry of soul

01:00.850 --> 01:03.683
She sa/7ed on a day

01:03.770 --> 01:05.806
Over the sea

01:05.900 --> 01:08.972
7'o S/(ye

Eli/ow and breeze

J's/ands and seas

01:14.110 --> 01:18.399
Mountains of ram and sun

01:19.370 --> 01:21.941
All that was good

01:22.040 --> 01:24.452
All that was fair

01:24.540 --> 01:27.168
All that was me

01:27.250 --> 01:29.662
Is gone

01:29.960 --> 01:32.008
Sing me a song

01:32.090 --> 01:34.832
Of a /ass that is gone

01:34.920 --> 01:37.388
Say, could that /ass

01:37.470 --> 01:40.098

01:40.180 --> 01:42.307

01:42.390 --> 01:45.382
She sa/7ed on a day

01:45.480 --> 01:49.439
Over the sea

01:49.520 --> 01:54.560
7'o S/(ye

02:31.440 --> 02:32.680
Mistress?

02:36.190 --> 02:37.521
It's fine, Lizzie.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.566
Mistress, ye're bleeding.

02:46.660 --> 02:47.740
Ye've been gone awhile.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.496
Were ye with that man?

02:51.670 --> 02:52.659
Yes.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.889
Mistress...

03:12.980 --> 03:14.060
I can help.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.139
Don't.

03:19.150 --> 03:20.606
Go to bed, Lizzie.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.890
Did he hurt ye?

04:45.320 --> 04:46.730
Lizzie, please.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.081
Ye have my hand here...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.911
and my ear if ye need it.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.007
Lizzie, please go to sleep.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.770
There we are, and for you.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.021
Do you know where I might find
the young woman I was with yesterday?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.576
Haven't seen her this morning.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.446
Must be up in her chamber still.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.575
MacKenzie!

05:36.960 --> 05:38.325
- Captain.
- Sit down.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.041
Please.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.079
Hungry?

05:46.340 --> 05:47.329
Not really.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.461
Shame. Sit.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.969
Well...

05:57.770 --> 06:00.432
Well, I'm pleased that you joined us.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.317
'Cause I don't have time to send a man out

06:03.400 --> 06:06.233
looking for the missing member
of my crew before departing.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.311
I appreciate that, Captain,
but I intend to stay here.

06:10.450 --> 06:11.656
Oh.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.786
So, all was well with your lass, then?

06:15.580 --> 06:17.787
I told you to be sure
she was worth it. Huh?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.707
Mmm. Captain knows best.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.121
Indeed he does.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.239
Especially when it comes to women.

06:26.130 --> 06:28.963
But yer lass
will have to wait for now, sailor.

06:30.550 --> 06:33.963
Because ye'll be coming
with us to Philadelphia.

06:35.850 --> 06:38.842
No, I told you I needed
to find my way to Wilmington.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.929
Aye, you did.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.604
And I told you it was but one
of our ports on the way.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.446
Oh.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.401
You weren't thinking you'd forsake us,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.281
abandon your duties
before our journey's end?

07:03.460 --> 07:05.951
Some more sage advice
for you there, Mr MacKenzie.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.876
My men do as they please
when they're ashore.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.756
But if they are not aboard
when the time comes to set sail,

07:15.770 --> 07:18.807
they often find themselves
missing more than their wages.

07:22.060 --> 07:23.766
I have friends in this town.

07:26.650 --> 07:28.857
I'd sooner see you
lose a lass than a limb.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.037
Ye'll be paid once the cargo's unloaded
in Philadelphia.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.708
After that, where you go
and what you do is your own business.

07:51.510 --> 07:53.922
Limb or lass, Mr MacKenzie?

08:04.560 --> 08:06.107
Tell the young woman I was here.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.365
Is it morning?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.956
'Tis well past the noon bells, Mistress.

08:34.300 --> 08:35.756
You didn't have to wash them.

08:37.890 --> 08:40.302
I don't want you
to exert yourself. You've been ill.

08:46.650 --> 08:47.719
Besides...

08:49.480 --> 08:50.981
I won't be wearing them again.

08:55.570 --> 08:59.279
Mebbe if ye took some more rest,
ye might feel better.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.868
I'll feel better when we find a boat
to take us to Cross Creek.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.996
- Not today.
- Yes.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.286
I can't stay here any longer.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.456
I have to see my Aunt Jocasta.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.462
I was promised she would be able
to tell us how to get to Fraser's Ridge.

09:14.590 --> 09:17.969
- But ye need time to rest.
- Time is not on my side, Lizzie.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.550
I need to find my mother.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.169
We leave today.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.532
The man who was here with me yesterday,
the Scottish man, did he return?

09:45.620 --> 09:47.076
Aye, he was here this morning.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.989
He asked after you.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.331
And then he left
with the crew of the
G/oriana.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.040
Do you know where they went?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.001
To the ship.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.775
The
G/oriana?

10:18.860 --> 10:20.407
The
G/oriana’s
gone, m'dear.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.400
She left on the morning tide.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.050
I love you a little.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.516
A lot. Passionately.

10:53.730 --> 10:54.890
Not at all.

11:02.950 --> 11:05.362
Mistress. Mistress!

11:05.450 --> 11:06.530
Lizzie, you shouldn't be running.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.905
It's unladylike, remember?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.571
Ye'll be glad that I'm no lady
when ye hear what I'm to tell ye next.

11:11.630 --> 11:15.293
Whist securing our provisions,
I spoke to a gentleman in the street.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.507
Had the look of a Scotsman about him.

11:17.590 --> 11:18.966
So marched right up to him, I did.

11:19.090 --> 11:23.299
We got to talking of this and that
and of all the Scots in North Carolina,

11:23.430 --> 11:26.968
and how some of them are doing
very well for themselves.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.636
I suppose you're gonna tell me
about each and every one.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.595
Well, not all of them.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.897
Those who make a show
of themselves, certainly.

11:33.980 --> 11:35.720
Lizzie, what are you talking about?

11:35.820 --> 11:38.937
At the theatre, the play
was brought to a halt

11:39.030 --> 11:44.150
when the wife of a Scotsman
acted as a surgeon and cut a man open...

11:45.030 --> 11:46.156
to heal him.

11:47.830 --> 11:48.819
Sounds like Mama.

11:48.910 --> 11:52.243
He assured me that the husband
was of good Scottish stock.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.536
A Mr Fraser.

11:56.130 --> 11:58.416
- When was this?
- That's the best of it.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.210
Last night.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.290
Here in Wilmington.

12:02.930 --> 12:03.919
They're here?

12:04.010 --> 12:06.922
He said Mr Fraser's over by McCabe's now.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.348
Excuse me, have you seen
a tall, red-headed Scotsman?

12:13.440 --> 12:16.227
Aye, he was here. He went round the back.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.639
Thank you.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.427
What d'ye want here, lassie?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.089
You.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.802
I'm sorry, lass. I'm a marrit man.

12:55.940 --> 12:56.929
I meant it.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.646
I have a wife.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.027
Are you...

13:02.240 --> 13:03.229
You're Jamie Fraser.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.059
Aren't you?

13:13.000 --> 13:13.989
Who asks?

13:18.340 --> 13:20.046
Have ye a message for me, lass?

13:22.420 --> 13:24.001
My name is Brianna.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.789
I'm your daughter.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.089
Bnanna?

13:37.020 --> 13:38.146
Is it true?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.229
It's you.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.729
It's me.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.457
Can't you tell?

13:56.710 --> 13:57.699
Aye.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.790
Aye, I can.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.171
Hadna thought of you as grown.

14:14.060 --> 14:20.056
Had ye in my mind somehow
as a wee bairn...

14:21.480 --> 14:22.469
always.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.309
As my babe.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.196
Never expected...

14:35.830 --> 14:37.491
Dinna weep, lass.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.838
Dinna weep,
a /eannan.

14:46.470 --> 14:47.789
Dinna be troubled.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.465
It's all right.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.630
M’ annsachd.

14:58.310 --> 14:59.436
It's all right.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.936
You'll have not seen your mother, then?

15:06.190 --> 15:07.179
No.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.269
Christ.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.692
She'll be mad wi' joy.

15:21.830 --> 15:22.876
Sassenach.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.546
Mama.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.335
Bree!

15:34.760 --> 15:37.172
What...

15:54.780 --> 15:56.361
We die in a fire?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.956
I knew you'd found each other,

16:00.040 --> 16:02.998
and I was just curious to know
more about your life together.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.780
I came across that old newspaper
with your names in it.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.297
But I didn't expect to see--

16:08.380 --> 16:09.870
News of our death.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.591
Smudged date.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.091
Unforgivable mistake by the printer.

16:18.430 --> 16:21.593
I didn't know if it was ten years
from now or ten months.

16:21.770 --> 16:23.931
I just knew I had to warn you
as quickly as possible.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.262
Well, we've some time either way.

16:28.360 --> 16:32.478
- Ye'll come wi' us to Fraser's Ridge?
- Of course she will.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.276
We have a fair bit of land,
have we no, Claire?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.448
There's still much to do,
but we have settlers and some crops.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.162
I travelled from Scotland
With a young woman, LlZZle.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.239
It's a long story,

16:45.330 --> 16:48.549
but, well, she's indebted to me,
and I'm indebted to her.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.040
She's welcome to join us.

16:50.630 --> 16:51.665
Uncle Jamie.

16:52.420 --> 16:55.389
I've seen to it that the belongings
and the casks are on the
Sa//y.4nn.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.630
Captain Freeman says...

16:58.310 --> 16:59.299
Pardon.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.386
Didna ken ye were with company.

17:02.350 --> 17:03.840
She's not company, lad.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.260
She's...

17:05.350 --> 17:06.556
Our daughter.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.509
Bnanna.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.185
Yer cousin.

17:11.940 --> 17:13.487
I know it's a surprise,

17:13.570 --> 17:15.401
but we'll explain it all later.

17:15.490 --> 17:16.900
When it comes to ye,
Auntie Claire,

17:16.990 --> 17:19.572
I've learned it's better_
not to ask too many questions.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.400
Well, then...

17:22.500 --> 17:23.706
Welcome, cousin.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.966
So handsome.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.306
Hmm?

17:40.810 --> 17:41.845
Oh.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.919
His name's Rollo.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.430
You are handsome, aren't you?

17:49.270 --> 17:51.477
Roger's here in North Carolina?

17:51.570 --> 17:52.605
Not any more.

17:53.190 --> 17:54.896
I didn't want him to follow me.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.862
This was something
I wanted to do on my own.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.577
But somehow he managed
to find me in Wilmington.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.242
God, I was so mad at him,
that he risked his life...

18:07.080 --> 18:09.162
but also really happy to see him.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.620
You're in love with him.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.209
Yes.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.669
We were handfast.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.170
Then we got into this huge fight.

18:25.430 --> 18:27.227
And now he's headed to Scotland,

18:28.310 --> 18:29.720
and back through the stones.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.930
Over one argument?

18:32.730 --> 18:34.311
Well, we were both upset.

18:34.650 --> 18:37.198
He threatened to,
and I told him to go ahead.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.355
That I didn't need him here.

18:41.410 --> 18:42.900
I should have gone after him.

18:45.910 --> 18:47.366
He sailed away this morning.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.279
It's my fault.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.909
Bree.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.831
I missed you so much, Mama.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.791
I've missed you too, my darling.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.988
I get a chill down my back
when we pass through here.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.230
Why?

19:19.320 --> 19:22.949
The first time we made this journey,
something terrible happened.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.400
We were robbed.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.071
The bastard and his men
took everything we had.

19:29.620 --> 19:30.951
The worst of it is...

19:31.960 --> 19:34.952
Is that Uncle Jamie had helped
this criminal to regain his liberty.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.791
I'm sure he was only trying
to do the right thing.

19:42.470 --> 19:43.459
Aye.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.130
Couldn't have foreseen it.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.762
This man, Stephen Bonnet...

19:51.140 --> 19:53.802
he had a way about him.

19:53.900 --> 19:54.889
Ye ken?

19:55.860 --> 19:57.566
Irish charm. He...

19:58.610 --> 19:59.986
He fooled us all.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.026
He slit our friend Lesley's throat...

20:06.870 --> 20:08.747
right in front of Auntie Claire.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.451
Stole her wedding ring, too.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.246
Uncle Jamie's never forgiven himself.

20:25.510 --> 20:26.886
Are ye all right, cousin?

20:28.220 --> 20:29.460
I'm sorry.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.055
Sorry, it's just...

20:33.690 --> 20:35.510
You paint such a vivid picture.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.220
I can see it so clearly in my mind.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.185
No, I'm sorry.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.526
I didna wish to scare ye.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.487
Hey, ye needn't worry.

20:46.030 --> 20:49.113
I'm sure 'tis only in our nightmares
he can trouble us now.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.180
Did ye hear more last night?

21:22.740 --> 21:26.312
Still can't believe
this Roger left her alone.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.408
Well, hopefully once we reach home,
she'll tell me the full story.

21:31.410 --> 21:34.038
We dinna need it
to see she's broken-hearted,

21:35.210 --> 21:37.326
but we'll do what we can to see it mended.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.205
So...

21:42.460 --> 21:44.371
The news she brought.

21:46.090 --> 21:47.967
Well, it certainly is disconcerting.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.130
Aye.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.092
We could make sure_
we're never In the cabin

21:53.310 --> 21:55.437
the Sunday before January let.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.181
Every year for a decade?

21:58.650 --> 22:00.390
Make a holiday out of it.

22:01.230 --> 22:03.357
I dinna believe
it'll be as simple as that.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.778
We havena had much luck
changing history in the past, Claire.

22:14.620 --> 22:15.746
Whoa...

22:22.550 --> 22:23.539
Come on, lass.

22:30.970 --> 22:31.959
Wow.

22:33.470 --> 22:35.097
This is incredible.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.971
Reminds me of Daniel Boone.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.816
A man ye ken from yer time?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.936
I don't know him, only of him.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.395
And, no, he's...

22:48.450 --> 22:49.690
Actually, he's alive now.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.031
Daniel Boone's a frontiersman.

22:53.620 --> 22:56.032
He'll explore lands further west
over those mountains.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.900
They'll name towns after him.

22:59.460 --> 23:01.530
Sorry, I don't...

23:02.340 --> 23:03.546
It's fine.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.045
He's used to it.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.459
Aye.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.519
Glad to see ye're still breathing.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.611
Yep.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.691
Ye ken by now,
I'm not an easy man to kill.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.786
When did you arrive?

23:37.250 --> 23:39.206
Last night. Thanks to you.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.202
Tryon wants to
have ye arrested for conspiracy.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.081
Ye have a spy among yer men.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.579
Had.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.166
Huh.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.887
I thought it wise
to make myself scarce for a while.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.750
I have a fine piece
of land set aside for ye.

23:55.850 --> 23:58.227
Say the word and I'll make
a start on yer cabin.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.186
Now, I have a surprise for ye.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.265
Ah.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.432
The lad's done well for himself,
bringing back two lassies.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.935
This is Brianna,

24:09.860 --> 24:10.849
our daughter.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.784
Brianna, this is my godfather, Murtagh.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.529
Hi.

24:22.290 --> 24:24.838
What took ye so long, lass?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.002
Auntie Claire says ye visited Lallybroch.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.007
So, ye met my ma and da, then.

24:31.090 --> 24:32.079
Just your father.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.000
Your mother was away helping with a birth.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.178
I'm sorry, I don't remember
which of your siblings it was.

24:37.260 --> 24:38.761
Dinna fash.

24:38.850 --> 24:40.056
We'll teach you all their names.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.847
Aye, could be ages learning, mind ye.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.687
Yeah, I'm still having enough trouble
with Fergus and...

24:46.770 --> 24:48.567
- Marsali.
- Marsall.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.026
Ye'll meet them soon.

24:50.110 --> 24:52.101
We hope they'll move here in the spring.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.811
Oh, and your father asked me
to convey a message.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.116
Your mother would like you
to write more often.

24:59.660 --> 25:02.652
Aww, yer ma chiding ye
from across the seas.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.787
Aye, and if ye've any sense,
ye'll pay heed,

25:04.880 --> 25:07.280
or no doubt she'll cross
the sea and tell ye herself.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.008
Been that way since she was a lass.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.330
What was Jamie like as a boy?

25:12.470 --> 25:13.926
- Oh...
- Ugh.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.672
Best clear away the cobwebs

25:16.760 --> 25:18.637
if ye're to remember
anything from that time.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.229
Well, then, there was a time

25:24.310 --> 25:27.359
when wee_Jam_ie was sent off
to foster With hIS Uncle Dougal.

25:27.650 --> 25:28.639
Christ.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.647
He was around 14 or so.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.065
Dougal had four daughters.

25:32.150 --> 25:35.404
And Tabitha was the first girl
that Jamie ever kissed.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.731
She was the first girl to ever kiss me.

25:38.910 --> 25:42.744
I was carrying two pails of milk for her,

25:42.830 --> 25:46.322
and Tib took me by the ears, kissed me.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.369
Mind you, I spilled the milk.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.660
A memorable first experience.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.752
And my mother caught us
and told Dougal about it.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.001
Aye, so the next morning,

25:58.550 --> 26:01.462
Jamie wakes up to find Dougal
standing over him.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.591
They had a very pleasant conversation.

26:05.270 --> 26:08.808
Dougal says that he would hate
to think that his nephew

26:08.900 --> 26:11.437
could take advantage
of his daughter's feelings.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.856
That doesn't sound so bad.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.488
Aye, but the whole time
that Dougal was talking,

26:16.570 --> 26:18.276
he had one hand on his dirk,

26:18.700 --> 26:20.691
and the other one resting
on Jamie's bollocks.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.038
I didna look at a lass again
until I was 16.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.629
Great. I want to hear
more of these stories.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.621
Plenty more
where that came from, lad.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.041
I think that's enough stories
for one night.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.547
It's good to have family
around the table again.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.669
Aye.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.808
I'll go fetch us
some more wood for the fire.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.055
You'll never guess who I met.

26:51.730 --> 26:52.936
Um...

26:53.020 --> 26:54.021
King George?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.481
Warm.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.270
George Washington.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.156
That's amazing.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.732
I'd love to hear more about it,
but I'm exhausted.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.940
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go to bed.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.826
- Good night.
- Good night, lass.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.826
Of course, darling. I'll...

27:09.920 --> 27:11.569
I'll walk you to the shelter.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.745
I can check in on Lizzie.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.542
It's a shame she wasn't feeling
well enough to join us.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.837
The lass reminds me of yer mother.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.749
Same eyes.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.386
Aye, she does.

27:27.430 --> 27:28.840
And she's here.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.221
Ye've suffered enough pain in yer life.

27:35.110 --> 27:36.566
I'm glad for ye, lad.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.140
I just hope she can...

27:39.150 --> 27:41.061
feel this place is her home.

27:41.950 --> 27:43.190
She's still a stranger.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.536
Give her time.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.689
She'll come to know ye.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.757
Checked in on Lizzie
again this morning,

27:56.840 --> 27:59.126
and in better light, it could be malaria.

28:00.010 --> 28:03.138
I think an infusion of Jesuit bark
will help with that.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.966
I hope so.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.130
She's been a good friend to me.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.629
Hmm.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.366
Daddy knew.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.405
That you came back.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.002
I saw the obituary on his desk years ago.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.797
I didn't realise what it was at the time,

28:42.880 --> 28:46.964
but I remembered it recently
when I found it again myself.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.596
He knew you came back to Jamie.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.850
Frank was an astute man.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.537
He always knew my heart was here.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.690
I can see it, too.

29:14.370 --> 29:16.418
I see why you had to come back to Jamie.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.427
It's quite a lot to take in...

29:26.970 --> 29:27.959
being here.

29:29.180 --> 29:30.340
It was for me.

29:32.430 --> 29:33.886
It's quite overwhelming.

29:37.940 --> 29:38.929
Damn it!

29:39.110 --> 29:40.099
God.

29:41.610 --> 29:44.067
It's all right. It's all right.
Let me help.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.269
Hey.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.828
You know, you can talk to me about Roger.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.075
He's gone.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.326
There's nothing I can do about that now.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.416
It's not as if I can phone him.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.898
Spend it wisely. Next.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.516
Mr MacKenzie.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.896
Back to Carolina for you, is it?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.390
As soon as I can make _
my way aboard another ship.

30:27.110 --> 30:28.941
You have Danu. I have Eros.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.696
Forgive me, Captain,
but I wondered ifI may have

30:33.790 --> 30:37.419
one or two of those small gems
instead of coin as wages.

30:38.630 --> 30:39.745
Huh.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.080
Mmm...

30:45.220 --> 30:46.255
The smaller ones, perhaps.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.886
Eros must be a difficult lord to serve.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.010
Always a lassie.

31:03.980 --> 31:04.969
Next.

31:33.810 --> 31:34.799
Thanks.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.455
Safe travels.

32:33.910 --> 32:34.899
Christ.

32:36.490 --> 32:38.538
_ Where in God's name
did ye learn to shoot like that?

32:38.870 --> 32:39.859
My father.

32:42.000 --> 32:42.989
Frank.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.029
I ken his name.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.415
Yer mother told me about him.

32:50.170 --> 32:51.159
Yeah.

32:52.130 --> 32:55.133
He and I would camp out,
and he taught me to shoot.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.589
So...

33:08.440 --> 33:13.059
It's a far cry from
the still cellar at Leoch.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.236
It does make whisky, though.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.446
Of a sort.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.492
The farmers from
the Ridge supply the barley

33:21.580 --> 33:23.616
and help distribute the liquor.

33:27.250 --> 33:30.162
So, does everyone always
call you "Young" Ian?

33:30.960 --> 33:33.929
When I was a bairn, it was "Wee" Ian.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.790
Everyone always just calls me "Bree."

33:40.520 --> 33:43.387
Is that what you call her
when you shorten her name?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.509
Aye.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.647
Something wrong with Bree?

33:49.150 --> 33:52.358
No, it's a Scots word.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.270
It doesna translate.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.410
A bree means a disturbance?

34:14.510 --> 34:15.499
Aye.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.039
Among other things.

34:17.140 --> 34:18.960
Well, you could have told her that.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.718
She's not some fragile piece of glass
that can break, you know.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.590
I dinna want to hurt the lass.

34:26.140 --> 34:30.349
She's clearly heartsick over this Roger.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.567
I ken how she feels.

34:36.950 --> 34:40.488
When I thought I'd lost you forever,
breathing was a chore.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.571
That's just a part of it.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.246
She doesn't want to hurt you.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.997
I've watched the two of you
the last few weeks

34:51.090 --> 34:53.331
tiptoeing around talking about Frank.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.506
Perhaps you should
take her hunting with you.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.841
It would take her mind off Roger,

35:03.220 --> 35:05.848
and you'd have some time
to spend together alone.

35:47.810 --> 35:48.799
Bnanna.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.116
I'll be hunting up the mountain.

36:04.030 --> 36:05.440
Will ye come wi' me, lass?

36:23.340 --> 36:25.501
So, what are we hunting?

36:27.350 --> 36:28.339
Bees.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.299
Bees?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.396
How do you hunt bees?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.679
Look for flowers.

36:39.940 --> 36:45.947
It's good to spend time with you,
a /eannan, m’annsachd.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.906
You called me that before.

36:48.450 --> 36:50.577
What does that mean,
”a /eannan ”.7

36:51.000 --> 36:52.490
And the other word you said?

36:53.710 --> 36:54.916
It means...

36:56.540 --> 36:57.746
Means my darling.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.501
M’ annsacho;
my blessing.

37:29.910 --> 37:30.899
Look.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.086
Ah.

37:48.050 --> 37:52.168
See, the hummingbirds like to drink
from the long-throated flowers,

37:52.270 --> 37:54.761
but the bees canna get inside.

37:55.390 --> 38:00.430
They like the broad,
flat flowers like these.

38:04.780 --> 38:08.568
They light on them and wallow
till they're all covered over wi' yellow.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.530
Watch.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.287
See which direction they go.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.966
A tree.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.266
That's good.

38:34.890 --> 38:38.849
Sometimes they hive among the rocks,
and then there's little ye can do.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.641
Now, it's best to wait until dark,

38:44.240 --> 38:46.731
for then all the swarm
will be inside the hive.

38:47.530 --> 38:48.940
How will you move the hive?

38:49.990 --> 38:52.117
Once all the bees
have gone to their rest...

38:53.160 --> 38:54.149
I'll...

38:56.160 --> 38:57.616
I'll blow a bit 0' smoke...

38:59.330 --> 39:01.286
into the hive, keep them stunned.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.212
And then wrap it in my bag.

39:09.470 --> 39:12.428
Then once we've returned home, ye'll see.

39:13.220 --> 39:16.269
I'll place it in a bee gum,
and come the morning,

39:16.350 --> 39:20.059
the bees will venture out,
looking around for the nearest flowers.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.852
Won't they realise
they aren't in their proper place?

39:26.940 --> 39:28.316
And what'll they do about it?

39:29.070 --> 39:33.188
They've no means to find their way back
and no home left here to come back to.

39:34.830 --> 39:35.819
Nah.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.037
Nay, they'll be content.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.082
Content in their new home.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.125
I have a home.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.171
I dinna wish to replace your father.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.010
He was a good man.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.511
I feel disloyal to him
even being here with you.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.180
I'm grateful to him.

40:06.190 --> 40:10.308
He raised you for yer mother's sake,
a child of another man...

40:11.450 --> 40:13.236
a man he had no cause to love.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.155
He stood by you both.

40:18.660 --> 40:19.706
And he loved you...

40:20.960 --> 40:22.916
even though he didna see himself in you.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.370
I had to give you to him.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.501
Though I canna say I'm sorry
ye came back to me.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.976
Sure I'm not a bree?

40:40.940 --> 40:41.929
Disturbance, huh?

40:43.690 --> 40:45.055
Murtagh told me.

40:47.190 --> 40:48.646
Aye, ye are.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.396
As was yer mother before ye, but...

40:53.820 --> 40:55.060
Ye're one I welcome.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.996
Ye're my flesh and blood.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.167
Since ye returned to me,
I'm finding ye're my...

41:06.750 --> 41:08.411
My heart and soul as well.

41:10.340 --> 41:11.329
So...

41:12.510 --> 41:16.344
I will keep calling ye Bree,
if ye dinna mind it.

41:19.970 --> 41:21.631
I don't know what to call you.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.643
You can call me Da, if ye like.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.019
Da?

41:31.570 --> 41:32.696
Is that Gaelic?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.229
No.

41:36.030 --> 41:37.110
It's only...

41:39.160 --> 41:40.320
It's only simple.

41:57.930 --> 41:59.090
Welcome back.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.891
I'll put the kettle on, shall I?

42:14.650 --> 42:15.696
Good job.

42:16.490 --> 42:17.525
You too.

42:23.330 --> 42:24.740
Aye, look at that.

42:49.650 --> 42:50.856
Can't sleep?

42:53.230 --> 42:54.231
No.

43:02.620 --> 43:04.360
Something bothering you?

43:06.120 --> 43:07.530
Och.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.877
Just a foolish regret.

43:14.050 --> 43:16.257
These past few weeks with our daughter...

43:17.720 --> 43:19.460
means so much to me.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.255
Must we lose her?

43:25.600 --> 43:28.342
I dinna want her to return
to her own time, Sassenach.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.511
I wish she could stay here too.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.061
For a while at least...

43:40.950 --> 43:42.269
but not forever.

43:43.990 --> 43:46.322
She belongs back in her time.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.819
It's safer there.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.451
There's more opportunities for her.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.836
I know I mustn't grieve for it.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.261
She...

44:10.140 --> 44:11.801
She smiles in her sleep...

44:12.860 --> 44:14.054
as ye say I do.

44:17.150 --> 44:19.698
I remember Jenny

44:20.570 --> 44:23.733
bending over each of her newborn bairns,

44:24.620 --> 44:27.487
watching them for hours.

44:30.410 --> 44:33.163
I could watch Brianna like that
and never tire of it.

44:37.210 --> 44:38.666
She's a gift...

44:42.630 --> 44:43.836
from me to you...

44:46.970 --> 44:48.631
and you to me.

44:54.230 --> 44:55.766
And she called me Da.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.341
Mistress.

45:28.060 --> 45:29.550
Ye're awake so early.

45:30.640 --> 45:31.800
I couldn't sleep.

45:33.190 --> 45:35.841
I thought I heard ye crying in the night.

45:36.810 --> 45:37.890
Are you all right?

45:39.150 --> 45:40.435
Just a bad dream.

45:41.110 --> 45:42.270
Another one?

45:43.200 --> 45:44.690
Ye've been having so many.

45:44.780 --> 45:46.691
Lizzie, I'm fine. Honest.

45:49.700 --> 45:50.985
Very well, then.

45:52.620 --> 45:56.454
If ye dinna mind, I'll be going with Ian
to the mill today.

45:56.540 --> 45:57.529
Of course.

45:57.710 --> 45:59.416
I'm gonna pick herbs with my mother.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.740
I'll see you in a while?

46:28.200 --> 46:31.738
Now, I know you're missing Roger.

46:32.740 --> 46:34.458
There's something else, isn't there?

46:39.500 --> 46:41.548
I wondered if you could still do that.

46:42.840 --> 46:43.829
Do what?

46:43.920 --> 46:45.080
Read my mind.

46:46.630 --> 46:47.927
Sort of hoped you could.

46:50.220 --> 46:53.053
Well, I expect
I'm a little out of practice.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.346
Give me a moment.

47:11.990 --> 47:13.400
How far along are you?

47:17.790 --> 47:18.996
About two months.

47:22.090 --> 47:24.331
Didn't you or Roger
think to use any precautions?

47:25.380 --> 47:28.213
I didn't think I needed
to pack condoms, Mama.

47:30.430 --> 47:31.419
Of course.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.762
I don't suppose
Roger knows about any of this...

47:37.020 --> 47:38.976
given that he left so soon after?

47:41.100 --> 47:42.101
Well, um...

47:47.360 --> 47:49.021
It might not be Roger's.

47:51.910 --> 47:52.979
What?

47:56.330 --> 47:58.207
It might not be Roger's baby.

48:04.250 --> 48:05.376
All right.

48:08.050 --> 48:11.213
Then whose?

48:18.480 --> 48:19.765
Um...

48:22.650 --> 48:23.719
There was...

48:25.770 --> 48:26.976
this man...

48:28.400 --> 48:30.311
at the Willow Tree Tavern.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.731
We started talking, and...

48:37.410 --> 48:38.536
And...

48:43.250 --> 48:44.990
And then I didn't fight him.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.256
I didn't fight him hard enough.

48:49.340 --> 48:50.910
Why the hell didn't I fight him?

48:51.220 --> 48:54.132
Brianna. Oh, Brianna.

48:56.470 --> 48:57.926
No, it's not your fault.

49:02.270 --> 49:03.760
Oh, my baby.

49:06.060 --> 49:07.391
My baby.

49:28.500 --> 49:29.626
How...

49:31.090 --> 49:32.660
How certain are you that...

49:34.340 --> 49:36.251
Well, that the baby isn't Roger's?

49:39.010 --> 49:40.386
Well, he didn't...

49:41.730 --> 49:44.893
I mean, Roger didn't, um...

49:46.940 --> 49:47.975
Withdrawal method.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.026
And when did the...

49:57.740 --> 49:59.116
It was the same night.

50:02.620 --> 50:03.700
Oh, Brianna.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.336
I need to talk to you.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.380
About Brianna.

50:29.230 --> 50:30.219
She wants to leave.

50:36.990 --> 50:37.979
No.

50:47.290 --> 50:48.370
What?

50:57.220 --> 50:58.209
She was raped.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.506
In Wilmington.

51:03.430 --> 51:04.920
Right after Roger left.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.516
She only just told me today.

51:15.650 --> 51:17.026
But there's something else.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.486
She's pregnant.

51:59.030 --> 52:01.908
Lizzie. What's the matter?

52:02.570 --> 52:03.776
It's him.

52:04.790 --> 52:07.190
Lord, it's... It's him.

52:07.290 --> 52:08.325
VVho?

52:46.120 --> 52:47.189
Uncle Jamie.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.695
Ian? Lizzie?

52:49.500 --> 52:50.489
What's wrong?

52:50.660 --> 52:52.662
She saw a man
that put a fright into her, Uncle.

52:52.750 --> 52:54.320
Near the road, sir.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.331
She kent him.

52:56.420 --> 52:57.409
Seen him before...

52:57.960 --> 52:59.257
with Brianna.

53:00.010 --> 53:00.999
And?

53:01.090 --> 53:02.079
At Wilmington.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.580
A brute of a man, he was.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.386
Brianna was afraid of him.

53:07.310 --> 53:10.347
He came close to her...

53:11.270 --> 53:13.306
and held her by the arms.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.436
Took her away with him.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.890
And you let her go wi' him?

53:18.980 --> 53:22.859
I should have gone after her,
but I was afraid, sir.

53:23.610 --> 53:25.157
May God forgive me.

53:28.790 --> 53:29.779
She...

53:31.040 --> 53:33.747
She didna return nigh till dawn.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.549
She had bruises,
and her nose was bleeding.

53:39.500 --> 53:40.501
And...

53:41.210 --> 53:43.508
There was blood on her petticoats.

53:44.590 --> 53:45.636
And...

53:46.850 --> 53:49.000
I could smell him on her.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.056
His seed.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.147
She was a virgin when he took her.

53:58.150 --> 53:59.811
I am her maid, sir.

54:00.530 --> 54:01.645
I saw the blood.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.269
And now he's come after her--

54:04.360 --> 54:06.271
Are ye sure this is the same man
who attacked her?

54:06.360 --> 54:07.657
I'm sure of it.

54:08.370 --> 54:09.860
D'ye think he's come to claim her?

54:09.950 --> 54:11.190
Go to the cabin.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.155
Dinna breathe a word of this
to my wife or daughter.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.239
You understand?

54:14.460 --> 54:15.916
O clear Mother.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.206
O blessed Mother, what have I done?

54:17.290 --> 54:19.497
Go! Ian, see her home.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.766
Need some help?

54:43.280 --> 54:44.349
Where did you get this?

54:47.570 --> 54:50.027
Brianna, tell me.

54:54.330 --> 54:55.570
Stephen Bonnet?

55:00.540 --> 55:01.529
He's the man who...

55:05.800 --> 55:09.964
I saw him with your ring,
and I offered to buy it from him.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.806
That's when it happened?

55:17.600 --> 55:18.976
Why did you not tell me this?

55:19.060 --> 55:20.266
I couldn't.

55:21.900 --> 55:23.720
Ian told me about
what happened on the river.

55:24.730 --> 55:26.482
And I knew that you would feel awful

55:26.570 --> 55:28.310
for what happened to me
because of the ring,

55:28.410 --> 55:31.777
and Jamie would blame himself
because he helped Bonnet escape.

55:32.700 --> 55:34.611
If he knows, he'll try to find Bonnet.

55:35.450 --> 55:37.156
And I can't let him do that.

55:37.750 --> 55:39.820
You've met the man, Mama.
You know what he's like.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.912
You have to promise me
to keep this to yourself.

55:44.050 --> 55:45.415
- No_.
- Promise.

55:55.390 --> 55:56.630
Good day, sir.

55:56.770 --> 55:58.260
Could you tell me
if Fraser's Ridge is near...

56:16.580 --> 56:18.536
Someone's coming. Someone's coming!

56:21.120 --> 56:22.280
It's Tom Burley.

56:36.850 --> 56:37.839
Get rid of him.

56:37.970 --> 56:38.971
Should I kill him?

56:39.060 --> 56:41.767
No. No, I won't make a murderer of you.

56:43.230 --> 56:44.891
Not that he doesn't deserve it.

56:50.570 --> 56:52.401
One, two, three.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.029
Go.

56:59.700 --> 57:01.076
What d'ye want me to do wi' him?

57:01.160 --> 57:02.161
I dinna care.

57:02.250 --> 57:03.740
Just get him out of my sight.
