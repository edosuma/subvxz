WEBVTT

00:14.865 --> 00:16.757
Hey, stay back guys.

00:17.164 --> 00:18.429
Whoa, hey!

00:23.318 --> 00:25.336
Hey, sweetie, time for me to get in?

00:26.664 --> 00:27.466
Oh!

00:29.106 --> 00:31.003
Oh, my goodness, that tickles.

00:32.238 --> 00:33.142
Right this way.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.621
Thank you.

00:34.991 --> 00:35.476
Thank you.

01:42.422 --> 01:45.650
Hey,Thanks for coming down.
Night shift's got a double in Florida City.

01:45.685 --> 01:48.945
- Not a problem. We've got a stabbing?
- Female. No name yet.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.384
Doorman said she came here alone.

01:50.676 --> 01:53.367
So, we're talking to witnesses,
but so far, none saw

01:54.027 --> 01:55.560
- or heard a thing.
- Shocking.

02:03.052 --> 02:03.602
Excuse me.

02:05.333 --> 02:05.747
Alexx.

02:06.369 --> 02:07.025
Horatio.

02:10.384 --> 02:11.232
Now that's interesting.

02:11.779 --> 02:14.478
Do you believe this bathroom? Nicer than my house.

02:15.213 --> 02:18.596
- Do we have a sex crime, Alexx?
- Place this nice, can it be anything else?

02:18.631 --> 02:21.355
Under all that makeup, she's just a kid.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.042
No ID.

02:24.252 --> 02:26.306
Be surprised if she was over 18.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.050
- You find a weapon?
- No.

02:28.461 --> 02:30.013
But it isn't a knife.

02:30.363 --> 02:31.661
The wound is ragged,

02:31.899 --> 02:32.471
messy.

02:33.972 --> 02:36.009
What about this discoloration around the neck?

02:36.275 --> 02:39.396
She might have a crushed larynx.
Killer punched her in the throat.

02:42.459 --> 02:44.245
Explains why no one heard her scream.

02:45.418 --> 02:47.684
Yeah, but we did.

03:48.548 --> 03:49.098
Thank you.

03:51.235 --> 03:53.358
Not a lot of blood for a stabbing, huh, Alexx?

03:53.583 --> 03:57.033
The bleeding was primarily internal.
Probably nicked an artery.

04:00.148 --> 04:02.901
Look what is this right here on the shoulder?

04:19.613 --> 04:22.609
- Implant of some sort.
- Looks like a microchip.

04:22.646 --> 04:25.072
Now, I know they put them in cars even dogs,

04:25.180 --> 04:26.394
but this is a first for me.

04:26.786 --> 04:29.158
I don't think that's a tracking device, though, is it?

04:29.193 --> 04:32.160
Why else would you have a microchip
implanted under your skin?

04:32.396 --> 04:34.649
They have their credit card numbers
built into the chip.

04:36.138 --> 04:39.189
- Chase Shaw. I own this club.
- You're kidding us, right?

04:39.224 --> 04:42.931
These girls wear next to nothing they have nowhere
to put their credit cards, so they get 'em implanted.

04:42.719 --> 04:44.801
We zap 'em on the way in, collect the cover charge.

04:46.609 --> 04:48.101
Oh, my goodness. That tickles.

04:54.957 --> 04:55.757
Thank you.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.343
It's like a Sun pass.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.287
Half the clubs in Miami are using 'em.

05:01.756 --> 05:04.988
- You recognize this girl?
- Like I told your detective, they're all the same:

05:05.389 --> 05:07.593
skinny, rich, entitled.

05:08.211 --> 05:09.998
Alexx, I'll be at A.V. lab.

05:10.506 --> 05:13.272
Have Calleigh process the young lady.

05:13.816 --> 05:14.644
You got it.

05:16.356 --> 05:18.405
I'm sorry. You have to stay here.

05:19.009 --> 05:21.270
I asked Homicide to hold all of 'em for printing.

05:21.325 --> 05:22.505
So I heard right.

05:22.832 --> 05:25.068
Women and men use
the same bathroom in this place.

05:25.086 --> 05:26.977
For everything but
going to the bathroom.

05:27.115 --> 05:31.131
Homicide said there was no less
than eight parties having sex in the stalls.

05:31.369 --> 05:33.259
Whatever happened to "get a room"?

05:33.484 --> 05:34.648
Hey, Alexx,

05:34.727 --> 05:36.040
do you mind if I take a quick look?

05:36.219 --> 05:37.137
Sure, Calleigh.

05:37.432 --> 05:39.055
She's not going anywhere,

05:39.268 --> 05:40.432
unfortunately.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.878
What is that all over her? Is it blood?

05:43.773 --> 05:44.904
Or worse.

05:45.396 --> 05:47.199
Guess it wasn't enough he killed her.

05:47.527 --> 05:48.934
Had to humiliate her, too.

05:50.822 --> 05:51.871
Thanks, Alexx.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.061
We just got lucky.

06:06.749 --> 06:07.733
What? Why?

06:07.897 --> 06:09.422
There's trace around the mouth.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.058
Thanks.

06:16.517 --> 06:20.595
One of the most fragile pieces of evidence
is evidence around the mouth.

06:20.779 --> 06:21.976
When we talk,

06:22.103 --> 06:25.128
- salivate, cough...
- Make the evidence disappear.

06:25.267 --> 06:28.365
So this stuff on her mouth
had to be there right before she died.

06:29.182 --> 06:30.706
Or else it would've been gone.

06:31.264 --> 06:32.411
Let's take it to Trace.

06:38.588 --> 06:40.326
See that blood pattern on the wall?

06:41.653 --> 06:42.817
It's cast off.

06:46.801 --> 06:47.932
Fast and furious.

06:50.579 --> 06:51.973
This was no random.

06:53.005 --> 06:53.989
It's too personal.

06:56.891 --> 06:58.891
There's an abundance of broken glass.

07:11.718 --> 07:13.259
Hey, check this out.

07:22.965 --> 07:24.342
It's coated in blood.

07:24.883 --> 07:27.496
Isn't spatter, isn't transfer.

07:27.752 --> 07:28.817
It's the murder weapon.

07:30.929 --> 07:34.126
I see a lot of smudges, but I don't know
if we're going to get any prints.

07:38.256 --> 07:41.407
Okay, can somebody tell me
how nobody saw this happen?

07:43.624 --> 07:45.165
It's "intelligent glass".

07:46.805 --> 07:49.921
Liquid crystals sandwiched
between two panes of glass.

07:50.539 --> 07:53.347
Electricity keeps the crystals parallel
and the glass clear.

07:54.785 --> 07:55.998
Shut the door...

07:57.211 --> 07:59.290
cut the circuit glass is fogged.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.568
Open it up,back to clear.

08:05.978 --> 08:06.896
That's cool.

08:06.928 --> 08:08.469
Did you learn that in night school?

08:08.847 --> 08:09.878
I've been here before.

08:09.879 --> 08:10.650
Hmm.

08:11.056 --> 08:13.622
Okay, why don't you print the patrons,
and I'll collect the unknowns.

08:16.904 --> 08:18.298
You know, it's a sex crime.

08:18.888 --> 08:20.445
I'll get buccal swabs, too.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.938
- What is that?
- It's a Q-tip. Open your mouth.

08:29.391 --> 08:31.505
Place your right hand on the screen, please.

08:33.051 --> 08:34.101
This is bogus.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.811
How do I know this isn't some sort of
major identity theft?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.857
Don't worry. I don't want to be you.

08:40.740 --> 08:41.559
You should.

08:42.116 --> 08:43.182
I'm a Bradford.

08:43.892 --> 08:46.617
- Like Bradford Sugar?
- Yeah, exactly like that.

08:48.892 --> 08:49.906
Next.

08:53.482 --> 08:54.613
Right hand on the pad.

08:55.473 --> 08:57.014
So serious.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.096
That's hot.

09:01.111 --> 09:03.677
- Open your mouth.
- Guys usually say please.

09:04.847 --> 09:06.519
Can you tell me the name of the Buckeye State?

09:07.109 --> 09:08.207
What's a Buckeye?

09:09.404 --> 09:10.437
Say Ohio.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.584
O-hi-o.

09:14.466 --> 09:15.335
That's hot.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.234
We found this implanted
in our victim's shoulder.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.200
It's a Verichip.

09:29.249 --> 09:30.479
You scan it here.

09:32.396 --> 09:33.790
Information pops up there.

09:34.003 --> 09:35.756
Your whole life on a grain of rice.

09:35.757 --> 09:38.555
Okay, hit "More Info",
see if we get a driver's license.

09:41.150 --> 09:42.888
Yeah. Jenny Price. 18.

09:43.121 --> 09:46.450
Chase Shaw said this
thing holds credit card information.

09:48.711 --> 09:49.629
That's weird.

09:49.973 --> 09:52.088
Her I.D. doesn't match her billing address.

09:53.535 --> 09:55.781
648 Halston. How I know that?

09:59.699 --> 10:01.289
648 Halston.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.658
Here it is-- it's a government building.
Alcoholic Beverage Control.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.860
Wait. An 18-year-old girl with an
A.B.C. credit card? Doesn't make sense.

10:09.895 --> 10:10.892
Not yet, it doesn't.

10:12.135 --> 10:13.790
Jenny Price was undercover?

10:13.856 --> 10:15.840
All she'd do is try to buy drinks,

10:16.463 --> 10:18.199
keep lists of everyone who was buying.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.006
We'd do a club sweep every few weeks
it's not usually dangerous.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.723
She was 18 years old, Ms. Eckhart.

10:22.758 --> 10:25.074
That's the point she was there
to monitor underage drinking.

10:25.348 --> 10:27.653
A.B.C. can't send in a 35-year-old to do that.

10:27.688 --> 10:29.820
She was a teenager over her head.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.184
She was an investigative aide.

10:31.249 --> 10:32.397
I'm aware of the program.

10:32.462 --> 10:35.063
Then you know it's all volunteer.
Jenny asked to do this.

10:35.841 --> 10:38.463
Her brother died of alcohol poisoning.
It's-it's why she joined.

10:38.497 --> 10:41.653
Aren't there special agents
that are designed to supervise these people?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.303
We're a little understaffed
at the moment budget cuts.

10:44.338 --> 10:46.068
And that's what you want me to tell her parents?

10:46.644 --> 10:47.497
Budget cuts?

10:49.038 --> 10:49.992
Point made.

10:50.398 --> 10:51.135
How can I help?

10:51.136 --> 10:53.992
I need a list of everybody at the club
she was targeting.

10:55.838 --> 10:56.838
I brought her file.

11:05.068 --> 11:08.425
Chase Shaw, the owner of the club
where she was killed. She was targeting to him.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.016
She was targeting him all month.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.609
She found scores of underage sales.

11:13.167 --> 11:14.642
We were going to bust them this Friday.

11:15.751 --> 11:18.464
And before you could do that,
somebody went there and killed her.

11:23.207 --> 11:25.442
Lieutenant, look I told you,

11:26.208 --> 11:29.089
I had no idea she was A.B.C.
I thought she was just a club girl.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.414
She was also
about to shut down your business, Chase.

11:32.814 --> 11:35.306
People say they saw you in the bathroom around the time of the murder.

11:35.926 --> 11:38.532
I wasn't using the facilities.
I was with Nina.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.385
Who's Nina?

11:41.827 --> 11:44.756
- When was the first time you saw Jenny?
- A week ago, maybe two.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.354
She was always in the VIP room
talking to a different guy every night.

11:47.618 --> 11:49.635
You ever see her talking to anyone in particular?

11:50.005 --> 11:52.178
Nah, I figured she was just trying to snag a rich guy.

11:52.193 --> 11:53.911
You're a rich guy, Chase.

11:53.997 --> 11:55.024
I didn't touch her.

11:56.874 --> 11:57.829
Chase,

11:58.431 --> 12:00.501
if I find out that you did this,

12:01.027 --> 12:02.819
you're going to lose more than this club.

12:03.171 --> 12:04.184
You understand?

12:09.053 --> 12:10.069
You going to answer that?

12:10.938 --> 12:13.498
Probably just some homeless guy.
They come by all the time.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.627
"Homeless guy."

12:19.099 --> 12:20.542
Got your cell phone number, too.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.689
Seriously, I wouldn't do that.They're obnoxious.

12:24.853 --> 12:25.919
Stay with him, Eric.

12:33.683 --> 12:35.341
Chase, what took you so long?

12:35.831 --> 12:36.946
We got a problem.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.860
What kind of a problem?

12:48.136 --> 12:49.840
Don't move! H!

12:51.742 --> 12:53.201
Miami Dade Police!

12:56.296 --> 12:58.103
H, what do you got?!

13:04.112 --> 13:05.653
Did you get a look at the driver?

13:06.424 --> 13:08.547
No, he took off.

13:18.941 --> 13:20.498
Well, now I know why he's running.

13:28.202 --> 13:30.274
Keep looking. He couldn't have gone far.

13:30.284 --> 13:32.155
Okay, get back to me. Yes, ma'am?

13:32.190 --> 13:35.578
I got two different VIN number
one on the engine, one on the dash.

13:35.613 --> 13:36.928
The plates come back to a Toyota.

13:36.928 --> 13:39.433
So, the vehicle's been chopped.
That's not going to be helpful.

13:39.518 --> 13:43.199
We've flooded the area with uniforms. The problem is,
we don't know who we're looking for.

13:43.234 --> 13:44.613
Somebody that knows Chase.

13:44.613 --> 13:45.826
What, the club owner?

13:45.826 --> 13:46.875
Why don't we talk to him?

13:46.875 --> 13:51.098
Because he hasn't told us the truth yet.
So, let's go with who we found. Thank you.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.629
Alexx, do we have an I.D.?

13:52.610 --> 13:53.349
No,

13:53.364 --> 13:55.930
but I'll tell you one thing, Horatio.
He's not from around here.

13:55.987 --> 13:57.036
Why do you say that?

13:57.265 --> 13:59.690
Clothes are foreign-made,
and I'm not talking designer.

13:59.888 --> 14:01.681
His belt measurement's metric.

14:01.716 --> 14:02.820
So, he's European.

14:02.984 --> 14:04.195
And look at his teeth.

14:05.180 --> 14:06.443
Pronounced decay.

14:06.721 --> 14:11.057
Lack of dental work suggests non-fluoridated water.
I'm thinking Eastern European.

14:11.092 --> 14:14.713
Okay, and the ligature marks
suggest possibly an electrical cord

14:14.748 --> 14:16.652
would be a weapon of opportunity, right?

14:16.734 --> 14:17.734
Right.

14:17.915 --> 14:21.373
Ligature marks intersect in the front,
but don't double back.

14:21.879 --> 14:23.123
Killer was facing him.

14:29.105 --> 14:31.368
And Alexx, take a look at this watchband.

14:34.351 --> 14:35.614
Nice.

14:36.184 --> 14:39.502
Looks like something's caught between the links.
Could be epidermal tissue.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.321
- Let's get that to DNA, please.
- You want that "to go"?

14:42.922 --> 14:44.412
Always. Thank you.

14:51.903 --> 14:53.722
Have you got anything off the stall door?

14:54.948 --> 14:57.276
Lots of smudges. Two good prints.

14:57.850 --> 15:00.372
Only two out of all of the club
kids you printed.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.903
Bartender said somebody puked in the stall
a half hour before the murder.

15:03.938 --> 15:05.391
He cleaned up, narrowed the field for us.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.834
Venus Robinson and Jack Bradford.

15:09.123 --> 15:10.221
Let's start with Jack.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.041
Score one for the good guys.

15:14.418 --> 15:17.059
Your prints were on the stall
where Jenny Price was killed.

15:18.205 --> 15:20.463
- Well, that's a big leap to murder.
- Not really.

15:20.762 --> 15:23.276
Not if you found out she was working for A.B.C.

15:23.647 --> 15:26.754
- What the hell is that?
- She was about to pop you for underage drinking.

15:27.132 --> 15:28.214
So, I killed her?

15:29.985 --> 15:33.268
I think I can handle a $500 fine.

15:33.329 --> 15:35.329
But can you handle losing your inheritance?

15:36.821 --> 15:38.329
Did a little recon on you...

15:38.880 --> 15:40.476
your parents' trust fund.

15:40.831 --> 15:42.028
It's a matter of public record.

15:42.339 --> 15:46.434
There's a morals clause in there that says if you stay
clean and sober until you're 21, you get this.

15:46.831 --> 15:47.880
Breakwater Key.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.664
That's a whole island, isn't it?

15:50.614 --> 15:51.729
Wow.

15:52.696 --> 15:54.680
My parents are leaving me their lawn mower.

15:55.549 --> 15:58.073
What's the island worth, $20, $25 million?

16:01.925 --> 16:04.154
I wasn't in that stall when they say Jenny was killed,

16:04.285 --> 16:05.957
and I have someone who will vouch for me.

16:06.135 --> 16:07.528
Oh, you got an alibi?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
- He's got an alibi.
- We love alibis.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.883
- Let's hear it.
- I was with Kevin Lewiston on the dance floor.

16:14.837 --> 16:16.830
Hitting on some skanks, actually.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.410
He'll confirm that.

16:18.476 --> 16:20.850
And I got a little dizzy from the heat,

16:21.050 --> 16:25.134
- so, I scored a little bit of his Zintol.
- Zintol. The asthma medication?

16:25.369 --> 16:25.976
Yeah.

16:25.976 --> 16:27.336
Gives me a really good head rush.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.869
We were standing there when
someone came running out of the bathroom

16:31.173 --> 16:32.566
yelling to call the police.

16:34.468 --> 16:36.707
Go ahead, ask him. He'll tell you.

16:38.058 --> 16:39.288
He was overheated.

16:39.337 --> 16:40.681
You know, from the dance floor.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.107
You have asthma?

16:46.467 --> 16:47.746
People give me grief.

16:48.172 --> 16:49.418
Make fun of it.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.303
Jack's the first person to be cool about it.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.798
You do realize that handing out your prescription
medication is against the law?

16:55.833 --> 16:56.451
Yeah

16:56.923 --> 16:59.538
but Jack, he steamrolls over you, you know?

17:00.595 --> 17:02.973
If he wants my inhaler, it's no big thing.

17:03.103 --> 17:05.185
He wants an alibi, is it still no big thing?

17:06.281 --> 17:08.778
Kevin, you realize if he killed that girl and you're lying

17:08.779 --> 17:10.199
for him, it makes you an accessory to murder?

17:19.115 --> 17:20.295
It's okay.

17:20.557 --> 17:22.415
It's going to be okay. Just tell me the truth.

17:28.212 --> 17:30.278
I never saw Jack till after the police got there.

17:33.868 --> 17:35.196
Ryan, get the lights.

17:35.376 --> 17:36.606
Stand up.

17:48.053 --> 17:49.266
Turn around.

18:00.401 --> 18:01.548
Blood.

18:02.483 --> 18:03.991
You going to blame that on your friend, too?

18:05.221 --> 18:06.548
We'll take your shirt.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.171
This is ridiculous.

18:42.648 --> 18:43.763
Valera.

18:43.764 --> 18:46.370
Your skin donor is in the system.
He's Wayne King.

18:46.763 --> 18:47.960
What was his bid for?

18:47.961 --> 18:50.686
Grand theft auto.Two years.
Been out for 6 months.

18:50.694 --> 18:54.343
Ok so, we have a stolen car
and a guy with a history of stealing cars.

18:54.378 --> 18:55.612
That's helpful. Thank you.

18:55.734 --> 18:56.734
Sure.

19:00.259 --> 19:02.686
I didn't steal that truck. I never even seen that truck.

19:02.702 --> 19:06.135
Then how do you explain your DNA
on the guy that we found in the SUV?

19:06.292 --> 19:07.489
What guy?

19:07.915 --> 19:09.112
This guy.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.234
Hey, he came at me.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.504
See, the problem is
that you are still alive...

19:16.152 --> 19:17.644
and he's dead.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.415
Oh, no, it's not what you're thinking.

19:19.628 --> 19:22.550
I get weekly massages. Shiatsu for my back.

19:22.674 --> 19:24.575
A place called Twelve Palms.

19:24.739 --> 19:27.440
A girl called Sandy she was giving me a massage

19:27.592 --> 19:30.018
when this yahoo storms in and starts yelling.

19:33.353 --> 19:35.025
Sounded like Russian or something.

19:35.025 --> 19:36.435
Figured it had to do with the girl.

19:41.268 --> 19:42.596
She starts yelling at him.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.586
Then what happened?

19:44.580 --> 19:46.350
I never backed away from a fight in my life.

19:46.366 --> 19:47.514
So, you punched him.

19:47.530 --> 19:48.629
Once,

19:48.825 --> 19:49.711
maybe.

19:49.727 --> 19:52.337
Then the manager came in dragged his out.

19:52.362 --> 19:54.739
It was the last time I saw him. I was defending myself, man.

19:54.919 --> 19:56.116
Ask anyone there.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.313
You know, I'm confused. Why did he attack you?

19:58.510 --> 19:59.936
You find out, let me know.

19:59.969 --> 20:03.542
That's going to be easy,
'cause you are going to be in a holding cell.

20:10.881 --> 20:12.898
Your massage therapist is waiting for you.

20:12.881 --> 20:14.450
- Right this way.
- I'm ready.

20:14.816 --> 20:16.536
Wayne King yeah.

20:17.107 --> 20:18.222
I broke up the fight.

20:18.222 --> 20:19.763
Is that how you got the black eye?

20:20.665 --> 20:22.616
Teaches me to get in the middle of things.

20:22.993 --> 20:24.501
I threw the other jerk out.

20:24.497 --> 20:27.868
Were you aware that the other "jerk" ended up
dead in the back of an SUV?

20:28.661 --> 20:29.743
No.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.399
Man, that's rough.

20:31.858 --> 20:34.169
What was the fight between Wayne King and this man about?

20:34.532 --> 20:35.844
A girl. What else?

20:35.845 --> 20:37.440
- Which girl?
- Sandy.

20:37.532 --> 20:39.352
She's my best massage therapist.

20:39.466 --> 20:42.890
Gets a lot of appointments.
I figured the guy got jealous, or something.

20:44.151 --> 20:46.053
Where would Sandy's treatment room be from here?

20:46.594 --> 20:47.823
Follow me.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.444
Well, it looks perfect.

20:54.525 --> 20:55.607
Thank you.

20:55.624 --> 20:56.837
Clients demand it.

20:56.476 --> 20:59.693
No, he means too perfect.
There's an absence of activity in here.

20:59.704 --> 21:01.786
Well, I run a class operation here.

21:02.196 --> 21:04.196
Our clientele is very selective.

21:04.589 --> 21:07.448
Really I can't keep appointments in a trashed room.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.946
Depends on what kind of appointments you're talking about.

21:10.848 --> 21:12.110
It's a condom wrapper.

21:21.687 --> 21:23.786
What kind of massage do you offer here, Mr. Novac?

21:25.061 --> 21:29.618
That must have dropped from a client's
pocket when they changed.

21:29.653 --> 21:31.307
I run a clean salon here.

21:31.304 --> 21:34.042
Eric, do you have acid phosphatase in your kit, please?

21:34.517 --> 21:35.944
You know I do.

21:40.662 --> 21:42.137
Hey, w-what are you doing?

21:42.629 --> 21:44.924
Well, this is in plain sight. I don't need a warrant.

21:54.058 --> 21:56.109
A lot more than oil on these sheets.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.674
Are you running a prostitution ring
out of here, Tommy?

22:01.103 --> 22:03.382
Wouldn't I need prostitutes for that, Lieutenant?

22:03.382 --> 22:06.569
Yes, you would. I need to speak to one of your
therapists. See what they have to say.

22:06.570 --> 22:09.395
Fine. Oh, you know, you're
going to need a translator.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.395
They, um, they only speak Hungarian.

22:11.395 --> 22:13.986
Shouldn't be a problem. I'd like to speak to Sandy first.

22:14.264 --> 22:15.559
Sandy?

22:16.056 --> 22:18.273
Didn't I, uh, mention she quit?

22:18.273 --> 22:21.608
No. How surprising. I need her address.

22:21.652 --> 22:22.574
I'm sorry.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.517
I don't have it.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.626
Mmm. No need.

22:27.626 --> 22:29.716
Her prints are probably right on here.

22:52.546 --> 22:55.479
Eric, you got a match print on Sandy?

22:55.479 --> 22:56.937
Yeah, but not in AFIS.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.291
What are you talking about?

23:01.003 --> 23:03.233
Well, we've already met Sandy.

23:03.233 --> 23:08.490
When I crapped out in AFIS, I went manual.
And I compared the print to the ones that Ryan collected from the club.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.377
Sandy is Nina.

23:10.377 --> 23:11.899
The club owner's alibi.

23:11.899 --> 23:16.287
Well, what do you know? Chase Shaw again. Thank you.

23:19.104 --> 23:20.313
Prostitution?

23:20.313 --> 23:21.994
I run a nightclub.

23:21.994 --> 23:29.522
Yes, but your friend Novac runs a spa. And the thing that you have in common,
the thing that you share are Hungarian girls like Nina.

23:29.522 --> 23:31.347
If there are hookers here, I don't know about it.

23:31.347 --> 23:34.039
And where is Nina? Otherwise known as Sandy.

23:34.039 --> 23:38.273
She's not gonna want to talk to you.
She's on an expired tourist visa. She probably took off.

23:38.273 --> 23:41.474
I think that you might want to take a look at that. Take a look at it.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.501
Who's this?

23:44.501 --> 23:50.323
It's a friend of Nina's. He was killed last night,
and discovered outside your club. That's who that is.

23:50.344 --> 23:54.463
- I was here all night. As I've said.
- Yes. With Nina.

23:54.537 --> 23:58.594
Which makes her your alibi for not one, but two murders.

23:58.594 --> 24:01.931
It's a shame that's she disappeared, huh?

24:06.065 --> 24:08.859
- You know, I think I could probably find her number.
- Really?

24:08.859 --> 24:09.980
Go get it.

24:27.084 --> 24:30.400
Ryan, I thought you were gonna process Jack Bradford's shirt.

24:30.410 --> 24:33.763
I am. The DNA confirms the blood belongs to our dead girl.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.421
Why are you in the Questioned Documents Lab?

24:36.421 --> 24:38.085
Using an infrared light.

24:38.085 --> 24:42.717
Yeah, I can see that. We usually use a Crimelite to do this over in the Layout Room.

24:43.136 --> 24:47.383
I took this criminalist seminar, Evaluating Evidence.

24:47.383 --> 24:51.936
The visiting lecturer said a CSI's job is to think outside the box.

24:51.936 --> 24:56.617
"Sometimes your best tool is the stud attached to your earring," she said.

24:57.444 --> 24:58.752
Those are nice earrings, by the way.

24:58.752 --> 25:00.422
You took my class.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.062
When was that, last spring?

25:03.062 --> 25:05.070
Yeah, it was just before finals.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.390
Am I reading this pattern right?

25:08.390 --> 25:11.862
The blood on Jack Bradford's shirt isn't spatter. It's transfer.

25:11.862 --> 25:14.192
Means someone transferred this blood to him, right?

25:14.192 --> 25:15.394
It could be incidental.

25:15.922 --> 25:17.894
Could also mean he was there during the murder.

25:19.802 --> 25:21.382
We need to find another way in.

25:21.382 --> 25:24.278
What about the victim? Did you find out what was on her shirt, the spots?

25:24.278 --> 25:26.407
No, but Trace should have processed it by now.

25:26.558 --> 25:30.560
Substance on her mouth, I'm still working, but the drops you saw on her dress

25:30.560 --> 25:35.421
cranberry juice, and vodka and some traces of citrus.

25:36.156 --> 25:38.853
If I'm not mistaken, that's a Cosmopolitan.

25:38.853 --> 25:40.221
Total chick drink.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.357
There was only one chick on our stall door list.

25:44.872 --> 25:46.348
"That's hot."

25:46.420 --> 25:49.104
Can we do this later? I have a facial.

25:49.420 --> 25:50.814
We have a murder.

25:51.235 --> 25:55.076
Your bar tab says that you were drinking Cosmos all night. Is that true?

25:55.076 --> 25:57.351
Hello. I started Cosmos?

25:57.595 --> 26:00.781
Everyone else was drinking apple martinis till I did Cosmos.

26:01.369 --> 26:03.226
Not that that's a big surprise.

26:03.226 --> 26:05.314
Is this a surprise?

26:05.314 --> 26:08.237
We found your prints on the stall door.

26:09.245 --> 26:12.655
And we found Cosmopolitan ingredients all over our victim.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.480
Did you have a fight with Jenny? Throw a drink at her?

26:15.480 --> 26:17.186
She was hitting on my boyfriend.

26:18.195 --> 26:20.475
Well, my sometimes boyfriend.

26:20.754 --> 26:21.987
Not cool.

26:21.987 --> 26:23.019
Your boyfriend?

26:23.019 --> 26:24.275
Jack Bradford.

26:24.543 --> 26:26.053
So, do you like the drink?

26:26.053 --> 26:27.742
Hey, turn around, beach....

26:29.173 --> 26:30.173
Stay off my man.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.046
Are you psycho? We were just talking.

26:32.531 --> 26:34.124
Yeah, like hell you were.

26:35.829 --> 26:44.537
Well, you know, that is very interesting, because we found
blood transfer on Jack's shirt, so we were thinking, whoever
killed Jenny brushed blood on to him after they did it.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.296
I threw my drink at her. I didn't kill her.

26:53.296 --> 26:55.759
I went back out on the dance floor.

26:55.759 --> 26:57.192
Ask anyone.

26:57.192 --> 26:59.447
You left Jack alone in the stall with Jenny?

27:00.685 --> 27:03.517
You want to get a Bradford, you're gonna have to do it without me.

27:03.517 --> 27:05.509
Well, money sticks to money, that it?

27:05.509 --> 27:10.019
You'd better call and cancel your facial. If he's on the hook, so are you.

27:17.526 --> 27:18.586
Nina?

27:18.586 --> 27:24.849
- Chase said you wanted to talk to me about trouble at spa?
- Yeah, that's true. Have a seat.

27:25.691 --> 27:28.970
I understand that sometimes you go by the name Sandy.

27:29.737 --> 27:32.909
We know that two men fought about you at the spa.

27:32.909 --> 27:33.990
There was no fight.

27:33.990 --> 27:34.887
No fight?

27:34.887 --> 27:36.701
If there was no fight...

27:37.751 --> 27:40.919
how did one of them end up like that?

27:50.731 --> 27:52.419
It's...

27:53.101 --> 27:54.869
Ivan, my fiancé.

27:58.606 --> 28:00.624
Ivan is your fiancé?

28:01.014 --> 28:02.816
Did you meet him here in America?

28:02.816 --> 28:07.432
Sumeg, my town in Hungary.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.860
Ivan followed me here.

28:10.604 --> 28:12.693
Ivan never hurt no one.

28:12.693 --> 28:14.150
Who would do this to him?

28:16.245 --> 28:18.726
- I don't know.
- Nina, I can help you.

28:18.726 --> 28:20.943
Who would do this to him?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.248
I don't know.

28:24.185 --> 28:27.360
Uh, give me a minute, will you? I'll be right back.

28:31.972 --> 28:33.245
She's a tough one.

28:33.245 --> 28:37.124
- She's tough, but terrified of something.
- Or someone.

28:37.391 --> 28:40.903
- Should I press her?
- Stay with her, and see what else she gives us, all right?

28:40.903 --> 28:41.736
Where are you off to?

28:41.736 --> 28:46.145
I'm gonna go back to the last place that her fiancé was seen alive.

28:53.210 --> 28:56.606
Oh, Lieutenant, good to see you again so soon.

28:56.606 --> 28:59.510
This time with a translator. Where are the girls?

28:59.510 --> 29:02.063
Well, you know, you just missed them. Just left for lunch.

29:02.063 --> 29:03.208
We also brought a warrant.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.735
There's nothing back there. You're wasting your time.

29:05.735 --> 29:07.966
I'm gonna take a look around until they get back.

29:11.753 --> 29:13.372
Get anything in the office?

29:13.372 --> 29:15.602
No. I searched all the treatment rooms.

29:15.602 --> 29:17.010
What about the attic?

29:17.010 --> 29:19.442
They have a crawl space. It's empty.

29:20.637 --> 29:21.937
What's behind here?

29:23.075 --> 29:25.749
It's a storage. Linen closet.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.661
Okay.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.637
The reason I ask is, look at the condensation here.

29:31.248 --> 29:36.112
Condensation causes peeling, so that means there could be a water leak behind here.

29:36.562 --> 29:37.929
Let's take a look.

29:44.092 --> 29:46.568
It's just a linen closet, but no plumbing.

29:46.568 --> 29:48.687
It doesn't make sense, but that...

29:49.511 --> 29:52.968
That condensation means there's water behind this wall.

30:05.441 --> 30:09.546
Take a look at this. Somebody has moved this shelf quite a few times.

30:10.883 --> 30:12.483
Hmm. What's behind there?

30:29.275 --> 30:30.860
What is this place?

30:31.997 --> 30:35.253
Air conditioning room. Looks like a prison.

30:36.073 --> 30:38.066
This is what Nina was afraid of.

30:38.066 --> 30:40.326
Since when do pimps start locking up their girls?

30:40.326 --> 30:43.239
This is not just prostitution, Eric. This is human trafficking.

30:43.239 --> 30:44.448
Slavery.

30:44.448 --> 30:50.790
Yes, they prey on the most vulnerable  of women, and Novac obviously has them on the move.

30:54.192 --> 30:55.650
A broken lamp.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.594
No electrical cord.

30:58.594 --> 30:59.993
It's got to be here somewhere.

31:02.144 --> 31:04.641
What's that right there? I'll give you two guesses.

31:16.791 --> 31:20.903
So, you've got a weapon of opportunity.

31:24.764 --> 31:25.957
Ready to go, Tommy?

31:25.957 --> 31:26.942
Go where?

31:27.270 --> 31:28.320
To jail.

31:29.850 --> 31:35.244
- What? Why?
- Pandering, trafficking and murder, and that's just for starters.

31:44.212 --> 31:48.552
You've been flying women in from Hungary, Tommy,

31:49.570 --> 31:51.556
and then promising them the American dream.

31:51.556 --> 31:53.277
I promise them jobs.

31:53.277 --> 31:55.149
Jobs with no pay.

31:55.149 --> 31:58.247
So, they're forced to work off their plane tickets at your spa.

31:58.247 --> 32:03.855
The problem with choosing Nina was that she had
a fiancé who tracked her down.

32:04.105 --> 32:07.360
And you were forced to kill him.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.150
You read way too much science fiction.

32:09.150 --> 32:10.183
Do I?

32:11.679 --> 32:15.297
How's this for some reality?

32:17.288 --> 32:18.625
No.

32:20.192 --> 32:23.448
Look, he was disrupting my business.

32:23.448 --> 32:29.730
He was attempting to save the life of the woman
he was planning to marry, and you strangled him.

32:29.730 --> 32:30.308
( speaking foreign language )

32:30.308 --> 32:31.775
Oh, my God!

32:31.775 --> 32:38.091
Stop it! Stop it!

32:42.395 --> 32:44.517
Don't be an idiot, man! She's damaged goods.

32:44.517 --> 32:45.820
Let Nina go!

32:53.896 --> 32:54.819
No.

32:56.296 --> 32:57.988
Check this out.

32:57.988 --> 33:02.028
The cause of death is strangulation and this cord matches the injury.

33:04.044 --> 33:06.926
- That cord could have come from anywhere.
- But it didn't.

33:07.299 --> 33:10.589
Ivan's DNA is in the middle of the cord, and yours is on both ends.

33:10.589 --> 33:15.598
You drove Ivan's body to the club, hoping Chase would help you dispose of it, and you ran into me.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.714
Here's what I'm really interested in. Where are the other girls?

33:19.714 --> 33:22.036
I don't know where they are, all right?

33:22.036 --> 33:24.010
I don't even know who they are.

33:24.010 --> 33:27.767
You hang on to their passports, as an insurance policy so they won't run, right?

33:27.767 --> 33:28.607
Wrong.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.769
I will tear apart your whole life to get those passports.

33:40.568 --> 33:42.015
I don't...

33:42.015 --> 33:43.608
keep the passports.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.593
Well, at least we know who you're in business with.

34:08.312 --> 34:12.478
Ryan, did you find the trace report?
Alexx says you got it mixed up with tox.

34:15.210 --> 34:16.554
Are you okay?

34:17.304 --> 34:18.842
Yeah.

34:21.274 --> 34:22.818
I used to be in patrol.

34:24.552 --> 34:26.543
Everything was moving along.

34:28.657 --> 34:32.387
It takes some getting used to. I understand.

34:39.014 --> 34:40.821
Results of what we found on her lips.

34:41.221 --> 34:42.630
I haven't opened it yet.

34:46.511 --> 34:50.417
Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol.

34:50.417 --> 34:51.947
That's a corticosteroid.

34:51.947 --> 34:54.217
Like from an inhaler for asthmatics.

34:54.362 --> 34:58.436
The victim was killed immediately after Zintol was deposited in her mouth.

34:58.793 --> 35:00.539
Well, it was the kiss of death then.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.112
Jack and Kevin were both using Zintol last night.

35:05.112 --> 35:07.198
But only one of them had blood on their shirt.

35:08.848 --> 35:10.025
I can't believe you people.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.669
Ah, you lost your island, huh?

35:11.669 --> 35:12.653
That's too bad.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.490
Killed that girl for nothing.

35:14.490 --> 35:15.762
Let's have the inhaler.

35:15.762 --> 35:17.661
I don't have the inhaler.

35:17.661 --> 35:18.978
Where is it?

35:18.978 --> 35:20.251
I gave it back to Kevin.

35:22.364 --> 35:25.763
If he asks, will you tell him I didn't have a choice?

35:25.763 --> 35:26.572
Sure.

35:36.197 --> 35:39.360
There was definitely Zintol in Jack Bradford's inhaler.

35:40.524 --> 35:43.181
What's that other peak? Is that cocaine?

35:43.626 --> 35:45.149
Looks like it, yeah.

35:46.007 --> 35:50.329
So, Jack added cocaine to the inhaler to double his high.

35:50.329 --> 35:52.543
Man, this guy needs a morals clause.

35:58.432 --> 36:00.318
Parents don't know the half of it.

36:00.318 --> 36:01.663
Wait a minute, there's something wrong.

36:01.663 --> 36:03.479
Do you have the report from the A.B.C. girl?

36:06.087 --> 36:08.703
There's no cocaine peak in her sample.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.363
That means Jack didn't kiss her.

36:11.146 --> 36:12.365
Then he didn't kill her.

36:12.365 --> 36:15.930
And there's only one other person who used straight Zintol in that club.

36:16.977 --> 36:19.235
I use it for my asthma, I told you.

36:19.235 --> 36:22.651
You forgot to tell us that you kissed Jenny before you killed her.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.093
That's not true.

36:24.093 --> 36:27.001
Kevin, come on. We have the evidence.

36:27.001 --> 36:32.176
What, prints? If you'd have found my prints,
you would have said something before.

36:32.573 --> 36:34.392
You shouldered your way in.

36:38.141 --> 36:39.710
We know that you kissed her.

36:40.855 --> 36:44.120
We found the exact components on her lips as in your inhaler.

36:45.031 --> 36:46.214
I-I don't know.

36:46.600 --> 36:52.418
Kevin, we know. You had two inhalers. You gave us the wrong one.

36:52.947 --> 36:54.601
Tried to set up your friend.

36:59.204 --> 37:00.350
I didn't mean to.

37:03.234 --> 37:06.874
I was just already nervous because I liked her.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.785
I could use a drink.

37:08.785 --> 37:10.997
All right. I'll be right back.

37:26.098 --> 37:29.069
Let me buy you a drink. Martini? Cosmo?

37:29.069 --> 37:30.269
No, thanks, Kev.

37:30.269 --> 37:31.956
You're too young.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.090
How's that for too young?

37:40.007 --> 37:40.738
I'll get you a drink.

37:40.738 --> 37:43.345
Kev, no, not from you.

37:44.341 --> 37:46.256
She kept coming on to everyone.

37:48.179 --> 37:49.325
At all the clubs.

37:51.228 --> 37:52.710
She just blew me off.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.921
She wouldn't let me buy her one drink.

38:08.384 --> 38:10.591
She didn't want to have to report you.

38:10.591 --> 38:12.328
What?

38:12.328 --> 38:19.823
She was working undercover for the Alcoholic Beverage Control.
She wouldn't let you buy her a drink because she didn't want
to have to report you to A.B.C.

38:20.925 --> 38:23.120
I thought that she was... She wasn't rejecting you.

38:23.745 --> 38:25.121
She was protecting you.

38:26.793 --> 38:28.160
And you killed her.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.723
And then you went out and transferred the blood on the jacket.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.696
Oh, God.

39:00.145 --> 39:01.654
How many are in there?

39:01.844 --> 39:03.086
Could be 20.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.596
Could be two dozen.

39:10.836 --> 39:12.399
Where are these girls?

39:12.399 --> 39:15.202
How should I know?
They show up a couple at a time.

39:15.202 --> 39:19.502
So, one of you gives them a place to sleep, the other one
a place to work. This way you can all play dumb, right?

39:19.502 --> 39:22.657
They work here, they party, they make money just like me.

39:22.657 --> 39:24.800
- Except they're prisoners.
- Just like you.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.988
Right? How does it feel?

39:34.873 --> 39:38.763
There's 24 girls missing. These traffickers move fast.
They could be all over the country by now.

39:38.763 --> 39:40.500
Not all of them are missing.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.133
One of them is right here.

39:46.914 --> 39:48.844
Did you caught who killed Ivan?

39:48.844 --> 39:52.216
Yeah, we did. We caught him. And Novac--

39:53.029 --> 39:56.512
Novac will pay for his crime, And so will Chase.

39:57.824 --> 39:59.104
Am I in trouble?

39:59.104 --> 40:00.848
No, you're not. In fact...

40:02.849 --> 40:04.466
you're free to go.

40:20.536 --> 40:22.082
But they are not?

40:22.082 --> 40:28.262
Nope, they're still out there. I closed the club
and the spa, but there's no sign of them.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.665
Nina, I need your help.

40:30.665 --> 40:32.897
Where else did they hold you?

40:33.706 --> 40:40.654
There is no one else that can hurt you now. But I can't free
these women without your help, so please help me.

40:45.181 --> 40:46.334
Nina.

40:49.718 --> 40:53.210
Sometimes they would drive us to a storehouse.

40:53.210 --> 40:54.769
Did you get a street name?

40:54.769 --> 40:56.350
They covered our eyes.

40:57.528 --> 41:01.248
What... What did you hear?

41:02.575 --> 41:05.168
( speaking Hungarian )

41:05.168 --> 41:06.881
What does that... What does that mean?

41:06.881 --> 41:08.690
Sounds like, like, bees.

41:08.690 --> 41:11.155
You mean, like a buzzing sound?

41:11.209 --> 41:12.860
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.598
A buzzing sound; what else?

41:16.189 --> 41:18.168
There was this bad smell.

41:18.168 --> 41:19.719
What do you mean, "bad smell"?

41:19.719 --> 41:21.655
( speaking Hungarian )

41:22.732 --> 41:27.544
Burning, like... like on cars. Like on cars.

41:27.544 --> 41:31.671
Burning, like, uh... you mean like
burning tires? Nina, burning tires?

41:31.671 --> 41:33.120
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:33.345 --> 41:39.378
That would be an oil refinery, and the one I'm thinking about
has a storage space right across the street. Thank you, Nina.

41:55.893 --> 41:58.456
The manager doesn't keep a set of keys to the lock.

41:58.456 --> 42:00.631
Are these units climate controlled?

42:00.631 --> 42:04.881
No, they're on the other side. These ones can get up to 120 degrees, easy.

42:05.709 --> 42:07.104
Okay, Eric, go ahead.

42:19.407 --> 42:21.305
I'll call the hospital.

42:21.305 --> 42:29.727
Tell them we've got at least two dozen abuse victims here.
Notify S.A.R.T., translators and psychological counseling.

42:29.765 --> 42:32.181
Yes, it's okay.

42:33.886 --> 42:35.489
It's okay, ladies.

42:38.145 --> 42:39.884
Shh, it's okay.

42:40.595 --> 42:43.890
( sobbing and speaking Hungarian )

42:44.961 --> 42:46.650
You understand "okay"?

42:47.547 --> 42:49.555
( speaking Hungarian )

42:50.966 --> 42:52.291
You're okay.

42:57.547 --> 43:00.423
Good America or bad America?

43:01.746 --> 43:03.325
Good America.

43:09.180 --> 43:10.863
Here we go, ladies.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.128
Here we go.

43:13.830 --> 43:15.014
Go ahead.

43:26.288 --> 43:27.711
Here we go.
