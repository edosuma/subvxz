WEBVTT

00:07.460 --> 00:09.789
WELL, KITCHEN IS CLEAN.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.749
(yawns) I'M TIRED.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.379
- OOH, I'M NOT.
- YEAH, ME NEITHER.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.119
MY YAWNING WAS CODE FOR
LET'S GET UPSTAIRS.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.499
OH, I'M SORRY, BUT I'M HOSTING BOOK
CLUB TOMORROW. I'VE GOT TO FINISH THIS.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.789
- DIDN'T YOU ALREADY READ THAT BOOK?
- YEAH, TWICE.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.169
YOU REALLY NEED TO READ LOVERS
IN BONDAGE MORE THAN ONCE?

00:23.170 --> 00:25.379
WHAT PART OF THAT BOOK WAS UNCLEAR?
I MEAN...

00:25.380 --> 00:28.329
HE DELIVERS THE PIZZA, SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT,

00:28.330 --> 00:29.960
THEY WORK SOMETHING OUT.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.419
HA HA HA, GET ALL YOUR
SNARKY COMMENTS OUT NOW.

00:33.420 --> 00:36.039
ONE OF THE GIRLS IN OUR
BOOK CLUB KNOWS THE AUTHOR.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.289
NOELLE DEVEREUX IS
GONNA BE IN OUR HOUSE

00:38.290 --> 00:39.619
- TOMORROW NIGHT.
- (gasps)

00:39.620 --> 00:41.169
SHE'S GONNA BE
HERE IN OUR HOUSE?

00:41.170 --> 00:43.999
IS SHE GONNA BE DOING A Q&A

00:44.000 --> 00:46.579
OR IS SHE JUST GONNA BE EXPLAINING
IN VIVID DETAIL HOW TO PUT A CUE...

00:46.580 --> 00:48.000
IN AN A?

00:49.460 --> 00:52.459
LOVERS IN BONDAGE IS ONLY THE
BEST-SELLING BOOK IN THIS GENRE

00:52.460 --> 00:55.329
SINCE 50 SHADES OF GREY. SO BEFORE YOU
JUDGE IT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ IT.

00:55.330 --> 00:58.119
MAY I? MIND IF I JUST
TAKE A QUICK LOOK?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.880
LET'S SEE HERE.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.619
"AS DEREK EXPERTLY
NIBBLED MY BELLY BUTTON,

01:03.620 --> 01:05.670
MY EYES ROLLED BACK IN MY HEAD."

01:06.750 --> 01:08.249
SOUNDS LIKE THE EXORCIST.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.750
SURE, IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN IF YOU
TAKE ONE SENTENCE OUT OF CONTEXT.

01:11.710 --> 01:14.119
YOU'RE RIGHT, HONEY. THAT WAS
PROBABLY JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.079
LET'S SEE HERE.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.040
(hums)

01:19.000 --> 01:20.619
AH...

01:20.620 --> 01:24.119
ALL RIGHT. "DEREK NEVER EARNED
HIS WINGS AT FLIGHT SCHOOL,

01:24.120 --> 01:28.290
BUT CLEARLY HE WAS AN
EXPERIENCED BUSH PILOT."

01:30.210 --> 01:33.710
OH, HONEY, COME BACK! WAIT, I HAVE
TO KNOW HOW THE BOOK ENDS NOW!

01:36.750 --> 01:37.919

- CALL ME "CASSANDRA."

02:04.000 --> 02:07.079
OH, RIGHT. YOU'RE STAYING IN
CHARACTER 24 HOURS A DAY,

02:07.080 --> 02:09.999
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST A
MEETING BETWEEN THE FILMMAKERS.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.209
WE DON'T NEED ANY ACTORS
UNTIL WE SHOOT TOMORROW.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.919
Zander: HEY, BABE, LENNOX
IS ON HER WAY OVER.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.709
AND JUST TO REMIND YOU SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER,

02:16.710 --> 02:19.330
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE
RIGHT MOMENT TO TELL HER.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.080
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T
THINK SHE'LL BE...

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
HI, LENNOX.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.619
GUESS WHAT?

02:27.620 --> 02:30.249
OH, I DON'T KNOW. YOU TWO
ARE SEEING EACH OTHER?

02:30.250 --> 02:33.079
YES. I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

02:33.080 --> 02:34.960
FOR YOU TO OVERHEAR THAT.
(nervous laugh)

02:36.120 --> 02:37.960
AND YOU THOUGHT THIS
MIGHT GET AWKWARD.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.079
ZANDER IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!

02:41.080 --> 02:43.619
HE'S DATING THE GIRL
WHO PLAYS CASSANDRA.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.749
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE...

02:45.750 --> 02:47.499
THE CHARACTER'S BASED ON ME.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.919
I MEAN, IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.330
ABSOLUTELY.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.040
NO, I'M LOST.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.209
HE HAD NO INTEREST IN HER WHEN SHE
WAS JUST A DITZY CHEERLEADER.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.879
ONCE I TAUGHT HER
TO BE LIKE ME...

02:59.880 --> 03:01.499
SHE'S EVEN WEARING MY CLOTHES...

03:01.500 --> 03:03.039
ZANDER TOTALLY FELL FOR HER.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.749
OH, I GET IT. YOU WANT TO GET
BACK TOGETHER WITH ZANDER.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.879
NO. I DO NOT HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HIM AT ALL.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.169
THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT
HIM GOING OUT WITH ME.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.829
THROUGH HER.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.750
WHILE SHE'S BEING ME.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
I BET HE EVEN THINKS ABOUT
HER WHEN THEY'RE... (gags)

03:19.830 --> 03:21.919
YOU KNOW, THE SAME
EXACT THING HAPPENED

03:21.920 --> 03:23.539
IN THIS NOELLE DEVEREUX NOVEL.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.919
THE MAIN CHARACTER DOMINIQUE
TIES UP HER HOUSEBOY ENRICO

03:25.920 --> 03:29.000
AND SHE WILL ONLY FEED HIM IF
HE GIVES HER SEXUAL FAVORS.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.830
- HOW IS THAT LIKE WHAT I SAID?
- YEAH, IT'S NOT.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.210
I JUST REALLY LOVE
TALKING ABOUT THIS BOOK.

03:41.380 --> 03:44.289
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVERYONE IN THE
BOOK CLUB HAS READ THE WHOLE BOOK.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.459
WHEN I READ YOUR BOOK, I
THOUGHT MY WATER BROKE,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.040
BUT IT TURNS OUT I WAS
JUST REALLY TURNED ON.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.789
THANK YOU FOR THAT IMAGE, NANCY.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.459
I'M GONNA PUT THAT QUOTE ON
THE BACK OF MY NEXT BOOK.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.209
SO WAS DOMINIQUE BASED ON YOU?

03:58.210 --> 04:00.379
WELL, THEY SAY WRITE
WHAT YOU KNOW,

04:00.380 --> 04:03.080
HOWEVER, I KNOW A FEW MORE
KNOTS THAN DOMINIQUE.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.959
- HEY, JOE.
- HEY.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.249
UH, IT'S BOOK CLUB
NIGHT, REMEMBER?

04:09.250 --> 04:10.829
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.
YOU KNOW WHY, HONEY?

04:10.830 --> 04:13.750
BECAUSE THE NEON "ADULT BOOKSTORE"
SIGN OUTSIDE WASN'T LIT UP.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.880
BECAUSE MY BOOK'S
JUST SMUT, RIGHT?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.210
YOU KNOW, IF THE
LEATHER MASK FITS.

04:22.210 --> 04:24.419
NOELLE, THIS IS MY HUSBAND, JOE,

04:24.420 --> 04:25.959
- WHO WAS JUST LEAVING.
- YEAH.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.619
WAIT. DON'T RUN OFF.

04:27.620 --> 04:28.959
HAVE YOU READ MY WORK?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.379
TRUST ME, I'VE...
I'VE READ ENOUGH.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.959
WELL, WHAT DIDN'T YOU LIKE?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.830
YOU CAN TELL ME. I'M
NOT EASILY OFFENDED.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.789
NOPE. I'M MARRIED ENOUGH TO KNOW

04:40.790 --> 04:42.420
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.120
(chuckles) MEN.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.329
SEE? I WAS RESPECTFUL
TO YOUR GUEST.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.920
- THANK YOU. -NO MATTER WHAT
KIND OF CRAP SHE WRITES.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.249
YOU KNOW, I'VE FIGURED IT OUT.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.749
IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE NOELLE'S BOOKS.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.749
- IT'S THAT YOU DON'T GET IT.
- OH NO, HONEY, I GET IT.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.709
I GET THAT IT'S THINLY-VEILED,
POORLY-WRITTEN LADYPORN.

05:01.710 --> 05:04.209
THE ONLY REASON THAT HACK IS
WRITING THIS ONE-HANDED LITERATURE

05:04.210 --> 05:06.120
IS BECAUSE SHE'S NOT TALENTED
ENOUGH TO CUT IT... HI!

05:07.710 --> 05:10.829
YOU KNOW, JOE HAS SOME
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT...

05:10.830 --> 05:12.540
J.K. ROWLING.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.919
YES, THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS

05:15.920 --> 05:17.960
ARE JUST THINLY-VEILED
POORLY WRITTEN LADYPORN.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.169
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THOSE MAGIC
WANDS REALLY SYMBOLIZE.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.289
(forced laughter)

05:23.290 --> 05:24.749
MAGIC... (forced chuckle)

05:24.750 --> 05:26.079
CAN I HELP YOU FIND SOMETHING?

05:26.080 --> 05:28.669
I JUST NEED A QUIET PLACE
TO MAKE A QUICK CALL.

05:28.670 --> 05:29.880
RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.709
GREAT. NOW SHE'S GONNA
TELL THE WHOLE BOOK CLUB

05:36.710 --> 05:38.169
WHAT YOU SAID AND THEN
THEY'RE GONNA SHUN ME.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.829
THEY'RE GONNA SHUN ME HARD.

05:39.830 --> 05:42.790
- YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO HER.
- OKAY, FINE.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.249
IT WENT TO VOICEMAIL.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.789
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW
SOBER EVERYBODY IS?

05:47.790 --> 05:50.040
I AM GONNA FIX THAT RIGHT NOW.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.709
SO, UM, NOELLE...

05:57.710 --> 06:00.539
SO, LOOK, WHAT I WAS SAYING...

06:00.540 --> 06:02.709
- ABOUT J.K. ROWLING?
- YES, YES.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.380
THAT WAS REALLY NOT MEANT
FOR YOU TO HEAR AND...

06:07.580 --> 06:09.079
I'M VERY SORRY.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.499
NO YOU'RE NOT.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.290
IN FACT, TELL ME MORE.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.619
WHAT?

06:14.620 --> 06:16.919
I GET FAWNED OVER
EVERYWHERE I GO.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.289
I NEVER KNOW IF ANYONE'S
EVER BEING HONEST.

06:19.290 --> 06:22.579
FRANKLY, HEARING NEGATIVE
THINGS ABOUT MY BOOK

06:22.580 --> 06:24.000
REALLY TURNS ME ON.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.380
COME AGAIN?

06:28.830 --> 06:31.750
TELL ME IT'S CRAP. TELL
ME THAT I CAN'T WRITE.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.459
- YEAH. -TELL ME THAT
WITH EVERY KEYSTROKE,

06:35.460 --> 06:36.920
I DEGRADE MYSELF.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.880
MAYBE I COULD JUST WRITE YOU A ONE-STAR
REVIEW ONLINE SOMEWHERE OR SOMETHING.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.959
NO, JOE.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.710
- TELL ME TO MY FACE.
- YEAH. (laughs)

06:48.710 --> 06:49.829
LOOK INTO MY EYES

06:49.830 --> 06:52.580
AND TELL ME THAT I'M
A BAD, BAD WRITER.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.920
MY WIFE'S HAVING HER BOOK
CLUB LIKE 10 FEET FROM HERE.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.669
- RIGHT, OF COURSE.
- YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU...

07:00.670 --> 07:02.789
IN CASE YOU WANT TO
CRITICIZE ME LATER.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.710
I WOULD ENJOY YOUR
PENETRATING INSIGHT.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.460
CHEESE AND CRACKERS?
(forced laugh)

07:11.580 --> 07:13.619
- WHAT?
- CHEESE AND CRACKERS.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.710
FOR THE LADIES. TO
GO WITH THE WINE.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.039
ALL RIGHT, SO SINCE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

07:23.040 --> 07:24.459
THAT WE SEE CASSANDRA
IN THE MOVIE,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.789
INSTEAD OF JUST FINDING HER
THERE BLOGGING, BORING,

07:26.790 --> 07:30.249
WHAT IF SAM USES THIS SCOOTER
TO DO, LIKE, A COOL DOLLY SHOT,

07:30.250 --> 07:32.209
SO WE SEE HER WHOLE APARTMENT
AND WE DISCOVER HER THERE?

07:32.210 --> 07:34.749
YEAH, THAT'S A MUCH MORE
EXCITING WAY TO MEET HER.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.329
- GOOD IDEA, ZANDER.
- IT WAS MY IDEA.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.829
REALLY?

07:38.830 --> 07:40.709
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

07:40.710 --> 07:42.579
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
CREDIT, RIGHT?

07:42.580 --> 07:44.459
- IT'S ABOUT THE GOOD IDEA.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.540
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.669
OKAY, ZANDER, I THINK I KNOW WHY
YOU WANT TO USE McKENNA'S IDEA.

07:51.670 --> 07:52.959
'CAUSE IT'S THE BEST
THING FOR THE FILM.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.789
NO, BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO GET IN HER PANTS.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.290
WHICH ARE MY PANTS, BY THE WAY.

07:57.670 --> 07:58.789
HEY, CAN WE START SHOOTING?

07:58.790 --> 08:01.039
I GOT TO GET MY GRANDMA'S
SCOOTER BACK REAL SOON.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.170
I JUST NOTICED HER
OXYGEN TANK'S ATTACHED.

08:05.170 --> 08:06.790
- OKAY, YEAH.
- WE SHOULD GO.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.710
HEY, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
APOLOGIZING TO NOELLE FOR ME.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.709
YEAH, WELL, YOU ASKED ME TO APOLOGIZE,
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I DID.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.709
SO HOW DID SHE REACT? WAS SHE
OPEN TO WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY?

08:19.710 --> 08:21.880
YEAH, SHE WAS... SHE WAS OPEN.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.620
UM, WIDE OPEN, ACTUALLY.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.499
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- HONEY, SHE...

08:29.500 --> 08:31.709
SHE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
MY APOLOGY, OKAY?

08:31.710 --> 08:34.669
MY... MY INSULTS TURNED HER ON.

08:34.670 --> 08:36.500
TRUTH IS...

08:37.670 --> 08:39.290
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE BOOK
FRIEND HIT ON ME.

08:40.290 --> 08:42.539
OH, PLEASE. YOU THINK EVERY
WOMAN'S HITTING ON YOU.

08:42.540 --> 08:44.959
IT'S MY BURDEN. I MEAN...

08:44.960 --> 08:46.920
YOU THINK I'M
IRRESISTIBLE BY CHOICE?

08:48.540 --> 08:50.959
UH, I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO
DISTRACT FROM THE REAL ISSUE.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.669
READING ABOUT WOMEN AS POWERFUL AS NOELLE'S
CHARACTERS MAKES YOU A LITTLE SQUIRMY.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.249
I THINK YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
THIS IS ONE AREA OF THE BEDROOM

08:57.250 --> 08:59.079
WHERE YOU'RE NOT AS LIBERATED
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.459
PLEASE, I AM INSANELY COMFORTABLE
IN EVERY AREA OF THE BEDROOM.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.419
EXCEPT IF A WOMAN
IS IN CHARGE THERE.

09:04.420 --> 09:07.209
I'M TELLING YOU, NOELLE HIT ON ME. I'LL
PROVE IT TO YOU. HOLD ON A SECOND.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.419
WAIT, WAIT. HOLD ON.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.170
LOOK AT THAT. SHE GAVE ME HER
BUSINESS CARD. SEE THAT? LOOK.

09:13.170 --> 09:17.290
OH. WELL, I GUESS THAT PROVES
THAT SHE WANTS ME TOO.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.209
SHE LEFT A WHOLE PILE
OF THEM ON THE TABLE

09:20.210 --> 09:22.620
WHICH CLEARLY MEANS NOELLE ALSO
WANTS TO GET BUSY WITH THE TABLE.

09:24.170 --> 09:26.250
FROM WHAT I READ IN HER BOOK,
ANYTHING WITH LEGS IS FAIR GAME.

09:30.500 --> 09:34.039
SO IF SAM STARTS THE SHOT ON
THE POSTER BEHIND THE BED,

09:34.040 --> 09:36.880
- IT'LL FORESHADOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
- YEAH, THAT'LL BE COOL.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.879
WAIT. WHERE DID THIS
IDEA COME FROM?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.829
WHY? DO YOU LIKE
THE IDEA OR NOT?

09:42.830 --> 09:44.500
I WANT TO KNOW WHOSE IT WAS.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.209
WAS IT YOURS, McKENNA?

09:47.210 --> 09:48.879
McKENNA.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.460
WHO IS THIS McKENNA?

09:51.790 --> 09:53.419
WAS IT YOURS, CASSANDRA?

09:53.420 --> 09:54.999
OH, YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.329
NO.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.329
OH, THEN WHOSE IDEA WAS IT?

09:58.330 --> 10:00.170

I WILL DO IT.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.579
I KNOW WHO WE COULD GET. ZANDER.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.789

10:24.790 --> 10:27.170

10:29.420 --> 10:31.079

10:41.920 --> 10:44.579

11:00.380 --> 11:02.579
YEAH. SO, LOOK, UM...

11:02.580 --> 11:04.919
MAYBE INSTEAD OF READING
ALL THAT EROTICA

11:04.920 --> 11:06.459
YOU SHOULD TRY PICKING
UP A BOY SCOUT MANUAL.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.209

11:09.210 --> 11:12.289

11:24.420 --> 11:27.329
YOU KNOW, HONEY, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE IF YOU'RE CLEAR

11:27.330 --> 11:28.999
ON THE ROLE OF THE DOMINATRIX.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.079
THE WAY IT WORKS IS
THAT THE DOMINATRIX...

11:31.080 --> 11:32.999
(muffled grunt)

11:33.000 --> 11:35.250

14:22.210 --> 14:23.290
I'M WARNING YOU LADY...

14:24.380 --> 14:25.880
MY FEET ARE DEADLY WEAPONS.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.419

DON'T WANT THIS.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.039
I DON'T. I DON'T WANT THIS.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.669
I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.669
THERE ARE NO LINES, ALL RIGHT?
GET AWAY FROM ME.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.329
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.
YOU WRITE TERRIBLE BOOKS.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.209
TERRIBLE?

14:39.210 --> 14:41.329
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.119
COME ON, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU WRITE SMUT.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.119
YOU THREATENED A MAN
IN HIS OWN HOME.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.999
I WRITE FEMININE EROTICA.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.039
YOU CAN'T EVEN ADMIT WHAT YOU DO.
LADY...

14:49.040 --> 14:50.790
YOU WRITE PORN!

14:52.170 --> 14:54.079
I KNOW, I KNOW!

14:54.080 --> 14:55.749
I WANTED TO WRITE
CHILDREN'S BOOKS,

14:55.750 --> 14:57.539
BUT THE MARKET IS OVERSATURATED.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.379
OH, I'M LIVING A LIE.

14:59.380 --> 15:01.499
I FEEL SO EMBARRASSED.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.829
(crying) OH GOD, OH GOD.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.579
EXCUSE ME. BEFORE YOU FALL COMPLETELY
APART, CAN YOU MAYBE UNTIE ME?

15:06.580 --> 15:09.829
OH GOD. "NOELLE DEVEREUX"

15:09.830 --> 15:11.919
I'M REALLY SUZY DORFMAN.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.579
MY PUBLISHER DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS SEXY ENOUGH.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.919
I GOT LUCKY WITH ONE BOOK

15:15.920 --> 15:18.119
AND NOW I HAVE THIS
IMAGE TO MAINTAIN.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.539
I'M NOT INTO BONDAGE.

15:19.540 --> 15:22.119
I DON'T EVEN LIKE PUTTING
A LEASH ON MY DOG.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.619
(crying)

15:24.620 --> 15:27.169
NOELLE, SUZY... WHOEVER YOU ARE.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.379
I'M REALLY STARTING TO
LOSE FEELING IN MY HANDS.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.209
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
I'M SO SORRY.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.709
- OKAY.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.919
YEAH, IT IS. YEAH.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.960
- LET ME GET ON TOP.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.249
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GETTING IT OFF.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.749
IF YOU'D STOP RESISTING
AND START RELAXING...

15:43.750 --> 15:45.330
- Joe: I...

15:47.120 --> 15:49.169

15:49.170 --> 15:51.670
HONEY... HEY, THIS IS NOT
REALLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:52.670 --> 15:54.749
NOELLE STOPPED BY BECAUSE
SHE LOST HER PHONE.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.169
IT'S TRUE. I LEFT
IT HERE, BUT I...

15:57.170 --> 15:58.170
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER WHERE.

15:58.171 --> 16:00.209
AND YOU THOUGHT
BOUNCING ON MY HUSBAND

16:00.210 --> 16:01.460
MIGHT JOG YOUR MEMORY?

16:05.210 --> 16:08.079
SO, CASSANDRA, YOU JUST MET
MY CHARACTER AT A PARTY,

16:08.080 --> 16:10.169
AND YOU THINK HE'S PRETTY CUTE.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.080
ACTUALLY, SHE'S JUST DRUNK.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.960
THANK YOU.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.119
SO WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE OUT AND IT'LL
DISSOLVE TO THE SHOES BY THE BED

16:19.120 --> 16:20.749
JUST LIKE THE
FORESHADOWING POSTER.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.669
THAT WAS MY IDEA.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.170
I KNOW, SAM. SHUT UP.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.290
AND WE'RE ROLLING.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.459
- THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU SAY ACTION,
LENNOX. -YEAH, I'M GETTING THERE.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.500
ACTION OR WHATEVER.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.079
YOU KNOW, I... I DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.249
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO. NOW SHUT
UP AND MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.789
- CUT! -WHAT... WHAT...
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:46.790 --> 16:49.459
NOTHING. THAT WAS A GREAT TAKE.
I THINK WE GOT IT.

16:49.460 --> 16:52.119
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.119
NO, NO, 'CAUSE IT SAYS IN
THE SCRIPT THAT CASSANDRA

16:55.120 --> 16:57.619
AND ONE-NIGHT-STAND GUY
KISS PASSIONATELY.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.039
ACTUALLY...

16:59.040 --> 17:02.419
IT SAYS THAT CASSANDRA KISSES THE STRANGER
LIKE HIS TONGUE IS A LIFE-SAVING ELIXIR

17:02.420 --> 17:04.210
AND SHE'LL DIE IF SHE
DOESN'T SWALLOW IT WHOLE.

17:08.670 --> 17:11.119
OKAY, YOU KISSED.
WE GET THE IDEA.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.709
CAN I TALK TO MY CO-DIRECTOR...

17:13.710 --> 17:15.330
IN THERE?

17:18.170 --> 17:21.119
OOOH-HOO-HOO-HOO.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.119
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME AND McKENNA DATING.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.039
I DON'T. WHAT MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.999
COME ON. YOU'RE RUINING
A KEY PART OF THE FILM

17:27.000 --> 17:28.879
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ME AND McKENNA KISS.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.209
YOU REALLY WANT ANOTHER TAKE?

17:30.210 --> 17:31.749
YES, I THINK THE
INTEGRITY OF YOUR SCRIPT

17:31.750 --> 17:32.999
AND THE MOMENT DEMANDS IT.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.210
(mocking) OH, "INTEGRITY
OF MY SCRIPT."

17:36.540 --> 17:38.080
FINE. LET BABY HAVE HIS BOTTLE.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.829
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

17:41.830 --> 17:44.919
I'VE JUST BEEN PLAYING THIS
CHARACTER THAT'S NOT ME,

17:44.920 --> 17:46.919
AND THINGS JUST GOT OUT OF HAND.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.789
- PLEASE BELIEVE ME.
- IT'S OKAY, NOELLE.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.120
OH, AND HERE'S YOUR PHONE.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.380
CALL ME SUZY. I'M REALLY SUZY.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.419
I PROMISE I'M GONNA STOP
WRITING THIS TRASH.

17:58.420 --> 18:02.380
OH, WAIT. NOT BEFORE YOU FINISH
WRITING LOVE AND BONDAGE 2, RIGHT?

18:06.080 --> 18:07.749
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING FOR?

18:07.750 --> 18:09.499
OH, BECAUSE SHE'S A BIG PHONY.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.079
WHY CAN'T YOU LET THIS GO?
WHAT IS REALLY BOTHERING YOU?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.379
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S BOTHERING ME?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

18:14.380 --> 18:16.750
WHY YOU NEED TO KEEP
READING THIS PORN.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.079
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU NEED
TO LOOK AT ALL THOSE LINKS

18:20.080 --> 18:21.380
THAT CHARLIE'S
ALWAYS SENDING YOU.

18:22.380 --> 18:23.920
I NEVER OPEN UP THOSE PICTURES.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.580
ONE IN TEN.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.039
ALL RIGHT, FIVE IN TEN.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.539
SO, WE AGREE.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.579
MEN AND WOMEN EACH
HAVE THEIR OWN PORN.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.079
YEAH, FINE, WE DO. BUT WE DON'T
HAVE CLUBS DEVOTED TO IT.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.959
ALL RIGHT? GUYS, YOU KNOW, WE
ENJOY OUR PORN ALONE AND ASHAMED

18:40.960 --> 18:42.209
JUST LIKE GOD INTENDED.

18:42.210 --> 18:46.419
MY POINT IS, CLEARLY, DIFFERENT
THINGS TURN ON MEN AND WOMEN.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.079
FINE, I GET IT. ALL RIGHT,
MEN, WE LIKE OUR PICTURES.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.789
WOMEN, YOU ALL
LIKE YOUR STORIES.

18:50.790 --> 18:53.620
YES, BECAUSE MEN ARE VISUAL
AND WOMEN ARE BETTER.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.329
ALL RIGHT.

18:58.330 --> 19:01.379
YOU LIKE STORIES, HUH?

19:01.380 --> 19:03.919
I GOT A STORY FOR YOU.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.709
IT'S ABOUT THIS
INCREDIBLY HANDSOME

19:06.710 --> 19:10.919
FORMER WALL STREET TITAN WHO WAS
IN DESPERATE NEED OF A JOB.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.249
NOT NOW, NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.539
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA
HEAR THIS STORY

19:13.540 --> 19:14.829
BECAUSE IT'S GOT
AN AMAZING ENDING.

19:14.830 --> 19:17.039
SO, ONE DAY, THIS, UM...

19:17.040 --> 19:19.119
THIS...

19:19.120 --> 19:21.169
AMAZINGLY MASCULINE MAN,

19:21.170 --> 19:23.580
BUILDING WITH MALENESS.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.539
SHOWED UP AT THE DOOR OF THIS

19:26.540 --> 19:28.709
VERY, VERY ACCOMPLISHED BLONDE.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.579
- WAS SHE HOT?
- SMOKING. SMOKING.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.669
- OKAY, THEN GO ON.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

19:32.670 --> 19:35.329
SO, OBVIOUSLY SHE HIRED
HIM IMMEDIATELY.

19:35.330 --> 19:38.499
AND EVERY MORNING, HE
WOULD MAKE HER COFFEE.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.879
AND HE WOULD WATCH
HER AS SHE BROUGHT

19:39.880 --> 19:41.749
THAT CUP OF COFFEE TO HER LIPS.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.669
AND AS SHE TOOK
THAT CUP OF COFFEE

19:44.670 --> 19:48.459
AND SLOWLY DRANK THAT THICK,
DARK, BROWN LIQUID...

19:48.460 --> 19:50.669
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO. NOT SEXY.

19:50.670 --> 19:53.619
I'M SORRY, THIS IS MY...
IT'S MY FIRST NOVEL.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.619
WILL YOU JUST GIVE ME A BREAK, HERE?
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.959
SO... SO EVERY MORNING,

19:57.960 --> 20:00.419
AS SHE WOULD DRINK HER COFFEE,

20:00.420 --> 20:02.959
SHE WOULD LOOK ACROSS HER CUP

20:02.960 --> 20:06.879
AT THAT INSANELY RIPPED
MAN AND SHE WOULD WONDER

20:06.880 --> 20:09.040
WHAT IT WOULD FEEL
LIKE IF HE WAS...

20:10.210 --> 20:13.829
UP AGAINST HER, PRESSING
HER WITH ALL OF HIS...

20:13.830 --> 20:15.040
MALE...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.500
MALE...

20:20.500 --> 20:21.580
MALENESS.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.079
OKAY, NOT BAD.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.999
BUT, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING
ON MY NIGHTSTAND JUST YET.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.879
WELL, ONE NIGHT IN NEW JERSEY,

20:30.880 --> 20:33.289
THIS HOT STUD COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

20:33.290 --> 20:36.919
AND HE GAVE IN TO HIS DESIRE
TO HAVE THIS HOT BLONDE.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.709
AT THAT MOMENT,

20:38.710 --> 20:42.209
HIS LIPS TOUCHED HERS
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

20:42.210 --> 20:44.379
- BINGO! UPSTAIRS, NOW.
- WAIT A MINUTE!

20:44.380 --> 20:45.919
I'M NOT FINISHED.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
YOU BETTER NOT BE.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.379
(Zander moans)

21:02.380 --> 21:04.499
YOU WROTE ONE STEAMY
SCENE, LENNOX.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.750
AND THEY ARE NAILING IT.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.829
MUST BE AWESOME TO HAVE
YOUR VISION REALIZED.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.289
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT
ELSE I'M VISUALIZING?

21:14.290 --> 21:15.500
YOU SHUTTING UP.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.580
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE ACTING.
