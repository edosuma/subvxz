18:01.551 --> 18:03.513
TO KEEP YOU IN THE DARK
FOR A WHILE.

18:03.513 --> 18:06.156
NO, SAM. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
WHY YOU'D KEEP THIS A SECRET.

18:06.156 --> 18:09.159
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU'RE THE SON
OF THE DEVIL, OK?
I--

18:09.159 --> 18:11.090
ME BEING IN THE DARK
IS BETTER FOR YOU.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.392
BECAUSE I WAS
AFRAID OF THIS.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.823
OF WHAT?
THIS! UPSETTING YOU.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.495
WELL, TOO LATE.
I'M UPSET.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.796
I KNOW, AND I DIDN'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

18:16.796 --> 18:20.099
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT ALL MEANT,
AND I STILL DON'T.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.631
OH, I KNOW.
YOU'RE FIRED.

18:21.631 --> 18:22.872
ANDI, WHAT?

18:22.872 --> 18:23.873
YEP. YOU'RE FIRED.

18:23.873 --> 18:26.476
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
LEGALLY CAN'T DO THAT.

18:26.476 --> 18:27.607
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.179
I MEAN, I HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING.

18:29.179 --> 18:30.480
SO THEN FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:30.480 --> 18:32.142
YOU'RE ON
DUMPSTER DUTY FOREVER.

18:32.142 --> 18:33.483
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

18:33.483 --> 18:34.344
NOT!
OHH!

18:34.344 --> 18:35.785
OK, I DESERVED THAT.

18:35.785 --> 18:37.747
CLEAN THAT UP!

18:37.747 --> 18:39.189
AN--[SIGHS]

18:58.438 --> 19:00.440
ANDI, COME ON. I JUST--

19:00.440 --> 19:01.571
HEAR ME OUT, ALL RIGHT?

19:01.571 --> 19:05.175
HEY. YOU JUST CAN'T
COME BURSTING INTO
PEOPLE'S OFFICES.

19:05.175 --> 19:08.448
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
NAKED IN HERE.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.182
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:12.182 --> 19:13.523
JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:13.523 --> 19:17.857
IT SEEMS WE'RE HAVING
A SMALL ACCOUNTING ERROR
IN PURGATORY.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.729
SO I OWE MONEY NOW?

19:19.729 --> 19:21.391
NO. A SOUL.
WE'RE MISSING ONE.

19:21.391 --> 19:22.832
NOT YOUR FAULT.
JUST KIND OF SLIPPED
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

19:22.832 --> 19:25.935
ALL RIGHT. WELL, TELL ME
WHO IT IS SO YOU CAN
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

19:25.935 --> 19:29.699
OH, YOU ALREADY
KNOW WHO IT IS,
THE BABY.

19:29.699 --> 19:30.340
THE BABY?

19:30.340 --> 19:35.775
THAT SOUL ESCAPED
SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE
HER BABY OUT OF HELL,

19:35.775 --> 19:36.606
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:36.606 --> 19:41.180
NO ONE GETS OUT OF HELL,
NOT EVEN OFFSPRING.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.852
I'M NOT SENDING
A LITTLE BABY TO HELL.

19:42.852 --> 19:45.184
OH, I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOUR HESITATION, BUT...

19:45.184 --> 19:49.819
YOU MUSTN'T ALLOW
YOURSELF TO BE FOOLED
BY ITS PUDGY CUTENESS.

19:49.819 --> 19:53.663
KID IS A BAD SEED.
IT'S DESTINED FOR EVIL,

19:53.663 --> 19:54.193
LIKE ITS MOTHER.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.866
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU. I--

19:56.866 --> 19:57.867
WE GAVE IT AWAY.

19:57.867 --> 20:01.501
AH. THAT JUST
WON'T WORK, SAMMY.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.734
I KNOW THAT THIS'LL
BE HARD FOR YOU,

20:04.734 --> 20:05.635
SO DON'T RUSH.

20:05.635 --> 20:08.908
JUST HAVE IT
BACK BY SAY, OH,
THIS TIME TOMORROW.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.482
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
RETRIEVE THIS KID,

20:12.482 --> 20:13.343
I WILL...

20:13.343 --> 20:18.818
AND IT WON'T BE
PRETTY FOR ANYBODY
WHO GETS IN MY WAY.

20:29.759 --> 20:33.263
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT
DRUGS FROM A DOCTOR SO EASILY.

20:33.263 --> 20:34.534
EXCESS TESTOSTERONE,
BENJI.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.435
PEOPLE GET
INTIMIDATED.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.507
IT IS MY GIFT
AND MY CURSE.

20:37.507 --> 20:40.470
OH, ALSO, I WEASELED
SOME PILLS OUT OF HIM

20:40.470 --> 20:42.512
TO HELP WITH
YOUR SCALP ITCH.

20:42.512 --> 20:43.413
OH, THANKS, MAN.
YEP.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.645
UH, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA TAKE YOURS?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.577
I'M WORKING MY WAY
UP TO IT, OK, BEN!

20:47.577 --> 20:48.978
I JUST WANNA HANG ON
TO MY MANHOOD

20:48.978 --> 20:50.780
FOR A COUPLE
MORE HOURS.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

20:50.780 --> 20:53.353
ALL RIGHT. I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH TONY.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.885
HE'S COOKIN' US LUNCH
AT HIS NEW APARTMENT.

20:55.885 --> 20:56.356
AH.
UM,

20:56.356 --> 20:58.988
HE'S NOT GONNA LET GO
OF THAT BABY EASILY.

20:58.988 --> 21:01.361
NO, NO, BUT LUNCH
IS PERFECT, THOUGH.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.262
TONY IS BOTH A
SUPERSENSITIVE DEMON

21:03.262 --> 21:03.863
AND A CULINARY
PERFECTIONIST.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.495
ALL WE GOTTA DO,
BAG ON HIS COOKIN'.

21:05.495 --> 21:07.437
HE STARTS BAWLIN',
RUNS DOWN TO
THE MARKET,

21:07.437 --> 21:08.998
GRABS SOME
LOCALLY GROWN
ORGANIC GARBAGE.

21:08.998 --> 21:09.799
ONCE HE LEAVES,
BOOM,

21:09.799 --> 21:12.041
VESSEL THE BABY.
BOB'S YOUR UNCLE.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.643
BOO!
AAH!
AAH!

21:13.643 --> 21:15.775
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.848
I CAME FOR YOUR BRAINS.

21:18.848 --> 21:21.010
AH, I'M JUST KIDDIN'.
ACTUALLY, I JUST THOUGHT

21:21.010 --> 21:23.383
WE COULD MAYBE HANG OUT,
WATCH THE BALLGAME.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.385
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.557
OH. UH...

21:27.557 --> 21:31.391
SAM, CAN I SPEAK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

21:34.464 --> 21:36.896
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.428
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, SAM?

21:38.428 --> 21:39.599
WE HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.070
OK, Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA SAY

21:41.070 --> 21:43.403
THAT I'M A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

21:43.403 --> 21:43.833
WHY?

21:43.833 --> 21:45.475
BECAUSE I'M GETTIN'
THE SENSE, SAM,

21:45.475 --> 21:46.606
THAT YOU'RE
BLOWIN' ME OFF.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.977
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

21:47.977 --> 21:48.878
YOU'RE BLOWIN'
ME OFF, SAM,

21:48.878 --> 21:51.581
AND FRANKLY, YOU'RE SHIRKIN'
YOUR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES.

21:51.581 --> 21:54.844
DAD, THIS IS NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO BABY-SIT YOU.

21:54.844 --> 21:55.815
OK? WH-WHAT ABOUT MOM?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.987
GET HER TO LET YOU
MOVE BACK IN.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.520
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME TO, SAM. SHE'S--

22:00.520 --> 22:01.921
YOU KNOW...

22:01.921 --> 22:06.095
I'M STARTIN' TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE ACTUALLY
BLAMES ME FOR THIS,

22:06.095 --> 22:09.929
AS IF IT'S MY FAULT
THAT I TURNED INTO A ZOMBIE.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.531
IT KIND OF IS
YOUR FAULT.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.833
OH, SO YOU'RE
PICKIN' SIDES NOW.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.805
YES. YES, I AM.

22:15.805 --> 22:18.067
ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS ALL YOUR DOING.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.339
ALL RIGHT, ALL THIS
HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOU.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.572
YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL, AND THEN
YOU LIED ABOUT IT.

22:22.572 --> 22:26.045
SAM, I'M YOUR FATHER,
SO I DEMAND A LITTLE RESPECT.

22:26.045 --> 22:26.816
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

22:26.816 --> 22:28.948
YOU'RE NOT
MY REAL FATHER!

22:28.948 --> 22:30.650
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

22:30.650 --> 22:36.055
I SAID THAT YOU'RE
NOT MY REAL FATHER.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.660
I SUPPOSE THE DEVIL
TOLD YOU THAT.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.531
YES, HE DID.

22:41.531 --> 22:43.463
I'M GUESSING
IT'S TRUE.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.535
SAM...

22:45.535 --> 22:48.468
YOU KNOW I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

22:48.468 --> 22:53.372
THAT THE DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL FORBIDS ME
FROM TELLING YOU ANYTHING.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.074
WELL,
THERE'S MY ANSWER.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.407
[SIGHS] SAM, I--

22:57.407 --> 22:59.579
I JUST WANT YOU TO...

22:59.579 --> 23:00.880
REMEMBER WHO RAISED YOU,

23:00.880 --> 23:04.914
WHO WAS THERE FOR YOU
GROWIN' UP, SAM,
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

23:04.914 --> 23:07.517
WHO LOVED YOU. I DID.

23:07.517 --> 23:10.420
NO MATTER WHAT
ANYONE TELLS YOU,

23:10.420 --> 23:11.721
I LOVE YOU.

23:11.721 --> 23:15.695
AND THAT'S REALLY
ALL THAT MATTERS, RIGHT?

23:15.695 --> 23:18.928
SURE. THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

23:19.168 --> 23:23.433
NOW I GOTTA
GO SEND A BABY TO HELL,
SO THANKS...

23:23.433 --> 23:24.874

23:29.439 --> 23:30.540
OOH!

23:30.540 --> 23:32.782
WELL, I AM SO GLAD
YOU GUYS WERE ABLE
TO COME OUT.

23:32.782 --> 23:37.517
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR STEVIE
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE

23:53.803 --> 23:55.434

THAT'S WONDERFUL.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.135

24:20.129 --> 24:21.891
ALL RIGHT, TO TELL

24:21.891 --> 24:23.462
I HAD A SALAD
THE OTHER DAY

24:23.462 --> 24:24.233
THAT WAS LOADED WITH
SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS,

24:24.233 --> 24:26.936
AND IT JUST
KINDA BLEW MY MIND,
THAT'S ALL.

24:26.936 --> 24:28.798
NO PROBLEM. I HAVE
SHIITAKE IN THE KITCHEN.

24:28.798 --> 24:29.639
I'LL THROW THEM

UH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN--
I DON'T EVEN THINK

24:31.871 --> 24:34.544
IT'S THE MUSHROOMS
THAT ARE THE PROBLEM. UM...

24:40.510 --> 24:43.753

IT'S A LITTLE BABY.
LOOK AT IT,

WITH ITS BIG EYES
AND ITS LITTLE FINGERS.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.552

WHAT IF THE DEVIL
IS TRICKING ME,

25:54.624 --> 25:55.755
TRYING TO GET ME

25:55.755 --> 25:58.287
I THOUGHT HE SAID
IT WAS GONNA GROW UP
TO BE EVIL,

25:58.287 --> 26:00.159
DO A BUNCH OF
MONSTROUS THINGS
LIKE ITS MOM.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.161
IT DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE A MONSTER.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.292
SO THEN
WHAT DO WE DO?

26:03.292 --> 26:06.936
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LOOKIN' AT ME
ALL CUTE AND STUFF.

26:06.936 --> 26:09.268

26:26.856 --> 26:28.187
THAT WAY, IT WON'T
BE LOOKING AT ME,

26:28.187 --> 26:30.660

ON THE BOTH OF US.

THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT?

37:07.996 --> 37:09.928
THIS IS--YEAH.

37:09.928 --> 37:13.732
YOU--YOU ARE
AN AMAZING SISTER.

37:13.732 --> 37:17.436
NOW, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T CHANGE.

37:17.436 --> 37:17.866

37:17.866 --> 37:19.738
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU?

37:19.738 --> 37:21.239

37:21.239 --> 37:22.411
YEAH. ANYTHING.

37:22.411 --> 37:23.712
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

37:23.712 --> 37:29.718
JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS
YOU NEED FROM ME,
AND I WILL GIVE IT.

37:30.679 --> 37:31.820

37:31.820 --> 37:32.881
[HARD ROCK PLAYING]

37:32.881 --> 37:35.454

SERVE IT UP.

37:40.289 --> 37:43.692
THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

37:44.833 --> 37:46.665
[SIGHS] GO AWAY.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.567
OOH. TESTY.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.037
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

37:49.037 --> 37:50.669
NO, I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, 'K?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.901
YOU HAVE SOME SICK NEED
TO MESS WITH ME AND SAM.

37:52.901 --> 37:55.374
WELL, NOT GONNA WORK,
SO THANKS FOR STOPPIN' BY.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.545
I'M NOT GONNA
MESS WITH YOU.

37:56.545 --> 37:58.507
I'M JUST SURPRISED
YOU'RE STILL DATIN' HIM.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.679
BEIN' THE SON
OF THE DEVIL AND ALL.

38:00.679 --> 38:01.810
YOU KNOW, SAM IS A GOOD GUY.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.281
HE'S NOT YOU.
REALLY?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.854
YEAH, AND WITH EVERYTHING
THAT HANGS OVER SAM'S HEAD,

38:05.854 --> 38:08.687
HE STILL MANAGES TO BE
A GOOD AND DECENT PERSON.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.560
I THINK HE'LL
ALWAYS BE THAT WAY.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.763
WOW. THAT'S AMAZING.

38:14.763 --> 38:19.498
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M--I'M IMPRESSED
BY YOUR INTUITIVENESS.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.599
YOU CAN SEE EVIL.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.801
I-I'M STILL TRYIN'
TO HONE THAT KNACK.

38:22.801 --> 38:26.074
EVIL'S A TOUGH ONE TO SPOT.
YOU KNOW, IT LURKS...

38:26.074 --> 38:28.877
MM-HMM.
DOWN IN THOSE
DEEP, DARK CORNERS.

38:28.877 --> 38:29.878
IT'S HARD TO SEE.

38:29.878 --> 38:33.882
OH, AND THEY SAY
THE WORST EVIL COMES
IN A FRIENDLY FORM--

38:33.882 --> 38:34.913
NICE SMILE,
FAMILIAR EYES--

38:34.913 --> 38:37.586
AND IT'S NEVER RECOGNIZED.

38:37.586 --> 38:39.488
WELL, UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

38:39.488 --> 38:40.519
ESPECIALLY
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.692
THEY SAY EVIL
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
IF IT'S GOT YOUR HEART.

38:43.692 --> 38:46.755
BUT GOOD FOR YOU THAT YOU'RE
SO CONFIDENT ABOUT SAM.

38:46.755 --> 38:48.797
I MEAN, THAT'S--
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

38:48.797 --> 38:52.601
I MUST HAVE MISSED IT,
BUT GOOD EYE, ANDI.

38:52.601 --> 38:55.033
GOOD JOB.

39:02.941 --> 39:06.445
WELL, THIS IS
THE PLACE.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.818
YOU'RE--YOU'RE GONNA
MOVE INTO THIS?

39:09.818 --> 39:11.119
YEAH. UNIT 18.

39:11.119 --> 39:13.552
IT'S A GREAT
STORAGE FACILITY.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.723
T-TO LIVE IN?

39:14.723 --> 39:18.086
YEAH. IT'S
CLIMATE-CONTROLLED,
QUIET.

39:18.086 --> 39:20.559
THE FIRST MONTH
IS FREE.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.360
ARE YOU SURE MOM
WON'T LET YOU MOVE BACK?

39:22.360 --> 39:26.835
UH, NO, SAM.
SHE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
WE'RE OVER.

39:26.835 --> 39:28.937
SHE BLAMES ME
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

39:28.937 --> 39:32.871
AND SHE'S GOT EVERY
RIGHT NOT TO FORGIVE ME.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.773
BUT, HEY, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WE, UH,

39:34.773 --> 39:38.747
PUT A FLATTY ON THE
WALL, SOME CHILI PEPPER
STRING LIGHTS,

39:38.747 --> 39:40.909
GET MY OLD SEAHAWKS
POSTERS FRAMED.

39:40.909 --> 39:44.483
COULD BE
A REAL MAN-CAVE, RIGHT?

39:44.483 --> 39:45.814
DAD...

39:45.814 --> 39:48.557
I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU.

39:48.557 --> 39:50.919
YOU'RE MY FATHER.

39:50.919 --> 39:51.890
WHAT?

39:51.890 --> 39:55.464
YOU KNOW, IF--
IF I AM A GOOD PERSON,

39:55.464 --> 39:58.767
IT'S BECAUSE OF
HOW I WAS RAISED, AND...

39:58.767 --> 40:01.069
YOU RAISED ME WELL, DAD.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.103
SAM...

40:06.505 --> 40:08.577
YOU'RE A GOOD SON.

40:10.879 --> 40:12.981
ANYWAY, LET'S, UH,

40:12.981 --> 40:16.945
GET THIS SUCKER
UNLOADED AND MOVE IN.

40:16.945 --> 40:18.887
WAIT. DAD.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.119
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

40:21.119 --> 40:25.724
Sock: A LITTLE TURN
TO THE LEFT. OK. YEAH.

40:26.755 --> 40:28.527
ALL RIGHT.

40:29.758 --> 40:31.500
HEY, GUYS.
HEY.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.461
HOW WAS
THE RIDE OVER?

40:32.461 --> 40:34.162
OH, GOOD. GOOD.
THIS IS GREAT.

40:34.162 --> 40:37.005
HEY, I GOT A BUNCH
OF REFRIGERATOR MAGNETS
FROM THE BENCH,

40:37.005 --> 40:40.669
SO YOU CAN STYLE
AND DECORATE IT
ANY WAY YOU WANT, OK?

40:40.669 --> 40:41.510
AW, THAT'S FANTASTIC,
BEN.

40:41.510 --> 40:44.442
'K, I WANNA BE
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT
SOMETHING, MR. O.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.874
YOU ARE A GARAGE
ROOMIE ONLY, OK?

40:45.874 --> 40:47.916
I DON'T
WANT YOU WANDERING
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

40:47.916 --> 40:49.518
IT'S OFF LIMITS
TO THE MOSTLY DEAD.

40:49.518 --> 40:51.780
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.222
OK, THEN.
WELCOME ABOARD.

40:54.222 --> 40:55.824
STAY COOL, MR. OLIVER.

40:55.824 --> 40:57.025
I WILL. I WILL.

40:57.025 --> 40:58.787
AND, YOU KNOW,
THIS PLACE IS SO ROOMY.

40:58.787 --> 41:02.791
I'LL HAVE TO HAVE
A PARTY AND INVITE
YOU GUYS OVER.

41:02.791 --> 41:04.893
TOTALLY.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.935
YOU ARE A GOOD SON.

41:06.935 --> 41:09.798
Mr. Oliver:
I SECOND THAT!
