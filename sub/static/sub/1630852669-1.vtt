<i>Friendly, peaceful-like.</i>

01:36.414 --> 01:40.044
<i>Good folks, just going about their lives
doing the best they can.</i>

01:41.385 --> 01:43.353
Yep, wide open spaces

01:43.421 --> 01:45.651
where you can dig
a nice deep burrow

01:45.723 --> 01:47.191
for your family to live in.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.883
Plenty of tumbleweeds

01:48.993 --> 01:51.394
and insects to feed your babies.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.390
But there is a danger

01:56.534 --> 01:58.525
that threatens our very way of life.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.797
<i>Is a Wild West seldom seen</i>

03:03.901 --> 03:06.461

Oh, great. Something else to fix.

You know the whole gol' durned

Why, if I hadn't promised your grandad

07:16.086 --> 07:17.417
that I'd always be here for ya,

07:17.554 --> 07:19.420

on that rattlesnake, Bumpy!"

"Don't drink water
from the creek, Bumpy"?

07:31.568 --> 07:32.501
Not that.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.041
Fifty-eight.

08:19.316 --> 08:20.442
Thank you, Diablo.

08:21.952 --> 08:23.886
Maybe I should pay Diablo to work for me

08:23.954 --> 08:24.944
instead of you, Clem.

08:25.122 --> 08:26.146
What do you think?

08:26.757 --> 08:28.122
Sorry, Mr. Critchley.

08:28.258 --> 08:32.160
I just don't get why we're planting
scarecrows way out here.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.621
To scare the prairie dogs.

08:34.998 --> 08:37.296
I hate prairie dogs.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.294
But why do you want to scare 'em off
a bunch of land

08:40.471 --> 08:41.905
you don't never use?

08:42.739 --> 08:45.231
[sighs] Diablo, help me out.

08:50.981 --> 08:51.971
I own land

here, here, here and here.

08:57.321 --> 08:58.982
I own everything.

Except for this.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.287
Betty Benson's place.

09:04.495 --> 09:07.362
Yes, Betty Benson's place.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.832
I'm not going to scare
prairie dogs off my land.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.130
I'm going to scare them onto her land!

09:13.804 --> 09:14.862
She'll be ruined,

09:15.138 --> 09:16.867
she'll have to sell to me.

09:16.974 --> 09:20.000
And I'll be the most
powerful man in the state.

09:20.377 --> 09:24.644
[chuckles] Beats the old days
of robbing banks, huh, boss?

09:24.715 --> 09:26.649
[gasps] Please!

09:26.850 --> 09:28.818
I'm a businessman now.

09:29.052 --> 09:29.951
I know.

09:30.020 --> 09:33.183
And that's why I tore this down
as soon as I saw it.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.730
[wind blowing]

10:01.885 --> 10:04.013
It's the brother. Bentley.

10:04.488 --> 10:05.683
[Clem] The one who moved away?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.422
They say he went to the city

10:07.524 --> 10:09.515
and made a fortune with the railroad!

10:13.830 --> 10:15.992
[gasps] Bentley, you've come home!

10:16.266 --> 10:17.097
Hello, sis.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.865
- "Sis"?
- You mean...

10:19.002 --> 10:20.265
We have a brother!

10:21.338 --> 10:24.899
Well, look at Mr. Railroad Tycoon!

10:36.386 --> 10:39.754
We knew you'd come back
and save the old Double UB!

10:39.856 --> 10:40.687
Oh, well, no...

10:40.757 --> 10:42.088
How rich are you exactly?

10:42.192 --> 10:44.422
- If I could just...
- Gonna buy us a new barn, I bet.

10:44.528 --> 10:46.587
- What I'm trying to...
- Is this all you have brought?

10:46.697 --> 10:47.630
- I'm not...
- Gee,

10:47.965 --> 10:49.729
I thought you'd have a fancier rig!

10:49.800 --> 10:51.598
Let me... You see, I...

10:51.802 --> 10:53.201
I'm not a tycoon!

10:54.471 --> 10:56.064
But, Bentley, your letters...

10:56.239 --> 10:58.367
All those business deals
you told us about.

10:58.542 --> 10:59.805
And your promotions.

11:00.043 --> 11:03.138
I may have... exaggerated a few details.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.145
Just a little. [chuckles]

11:05.148 --> 11:06.877
I guess I wanted to impress you.

11:11.488 --> 11:13.752
So, you're ea yin'
you're not the Chairman

11:13.824 --> 11:15.485
of the Consolidated Intercontinental

11:15.592 --> 11:17.754
Trans-American Locomotive
and Rail Consortium?

11:18.128 --> 11:21.621
Not yet. But I am the Junior
Regional Assistant Associate trainee.

11:22.299 --> 11:24.324
And I've got a bright future
ahead of me!

11:24.568 --> 11:25.399
As what?

11:25.769 --> 11:28.795
As the Senior Regional
Assistant Associate trainee.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.914
I know it doesn't sound like much,

11:38.081 --> 11:39.412
but I'm on my way up.

11:40.984 --> 11:42.611
I figure if I helped you
fix up the ranch,

11:42.686 --> 11:43.517
we could sell it.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.419
Then, you and Betty can come
and live in the city with me!

11:58.535 --> 11:59.468
Tell you what, Bent.

11:59.603 --> 12:01.128
You help us fix the place up.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.337
If I can't make it work, we'll sell.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.439
But if I can,

12:04.608 --> 12:07.475
we keep the ranch
and split the profits. Deal?

12:07.544 --> 12:08.602
Oh, deal.

12:09.346 --> 12:11.314
If we all pull together,
in a month or two,

12:11.381 --> 12:13.509
we'll be ready to drive
the herd to Abilene!

12:14.051 --> 12:17.146
Uh, you want me to go
on a cattle drive? Me?

12:17.454 --> 12:20.856
Ah, just a short one...
614 miles is all.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.356
Unless you get caught in a stampede,

12:22.459 --> 12:23.654
or washed away in a flood.

12:24.194 --> 12:25.457
Come on inside, Bentley.

12:25.529 --> 12:26.553
Let's get you something to eat.

12:26.897 --> 12:27.989
Then we'll talk business.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.172
What are we waiting for, Uncle Jerry?

12:39.476 --> 12:41.308
Let's go introduce ourselves.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.049
Wait a minute.

12:48.151 --> 12:49.141
Where are the...

12:50.387 --> 12:52.014
I was saying, where...

12:53.356 --> 12:54.221
are...

12:55.759 --> 12:57.318
the little fellas!
Where are the little fellas?

13:03.900 --> 13:04.992
[slurps]

13:11.908 --> 13:12.739
[chuckles] Dig in!

13:12.843 --> 13:14.038
Why thank you!

13:14.211 --> 13:15.736
Boys, where are your manners?

13:15.846 --> 13:16.779
We have guests!

What's wrong?

13:37.033 --> 13:38.933
Did you sit on a rattlesnake?

Moo-so-what-eya?

13:50.413 --> 13:51.744
Musophobia.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.709
A fear of mice.

13:53.784 --> 13:55.445
Or shews. Or ferrets,

13:55.552 --> 13:59.045
hamsters, hedgehogs, squirrels,
chipmunks, gerbils, muskrats...

13:59.122 --> 14:00.112
Betty!

14:00.223 --> 14:01.315
- Sorry.
- Which is why

14:01.424 --> 14:03.893
I go nowhere without my trusty Tom.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.255
He's tough as they come.

14:05.796 --> 14:07.127

[laughs]

14:10.667 --> 14:11.498

14:13.003 --> 14:16.303
Oh, sure, I could see that plain as day.

14:16.473 --> 14:18.464
Hmm, and I can see that my first task

14:18.575 --> 14:21.636
is to rid the ranch
of this horrible mouse infestation.

14:21.812 --> 14:23.143
"Mouse infestation"?

14:23.580 --> 14:25.139
You mean that? In there?

14:25.348 --> 14:27.316
[chuckles] You can stop worrying, Betty.

14:27.584 --> 14:29.848
City cats fight giant rats just for fun!

14:30.086 --> 14:31.485
Once Tom's on the job,

14:31.588 --> 14:33.989
your little mice don't stand a chance.

[Tuffy] That smell? It's...

15:32.048 --> 15:34.176
[Scruffy] Very familiar, isn't it?

15:34.517 --> 15:37.043
[Duffy] Let me think. Oh, I know.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.388
[all at once] Breakfast!

15:42.492 --> 15:44.358
- Yah!
- [horse whinnies]

16:26.303 --> 16:27.532
[chickens cluck]

16:32.642 --> 16:34.406
[all laughing]

17:01.438 --> 17:02.599
[panting]

17:15.085 --> 17:16.609
[chickens clucking]

17:38.141 --> 17:40.803
Don't worry, he's perfectly tame!

17:46.049 --> 17:47.312
[bellows]

17:47.484 --> 17:49.384
Maybe not that tame.

17:49.619 --> 17:50.984
Show him who's boss!

17:52.555 --> 17:54.353
Uh, reward him with a treat!

17:56.393 --> 17:58.191
Hit him with a rolled up newspaper!

17:58.895 --> 18:01.125
[Duffy] Dress him up
in a darling little outfit!

18:02.799 --> 18:03.789
[Tom screams]

18:06.236 --> 18:08.227
[Tuffy] It's nice to see them
playing together.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.703
[all] Aw!

18:21.484 --> 18:22.815
This might be a good time to address

18:22.886 --> 18:25.548
the commonly held belief
that bulls hate the color red.

18:25.655 --> 18:28.056
Actually, they're indifferent to colors.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.520
That's certainly news to me.

18:31.661 --> 18:34.858
No, bulls don't hate red capes.
They hate moving capes.

18:48.278 --> 18:49.507
Why is he thanking us?

18:49.612 --> 18:51.410
He's just a little over-excited.

18:52.248 --> 18:54.216
How many fingers do I have up?

18:54.517 --> 18:55.916
What day is it today?

18:56.219 --> 18:58.449
I don't think he understands about us.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.014
Let me explain.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.256
You came here with Bentley.

19:02.859 --> 19:04.725
We live here with Betty!

19:05.728 --> 19:08.720
Betty is Bentley's sister.
So that means that...

19:08.798 --> 19:10.425
You are our brother!

19:12.035 --> 19:13.628
Who's president of the United States?

19:13.803 --> 19:14.861
What's your mother's maiden name?

19:15.972 --> 19:17.599
Uh... get some ice on that!

19:17.941 --> 19:19.534
I'm your brother, Tuffy.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.473
This is your brother, Scruffy.
Your brother, Duffy.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.270
And this is Uncle Jerry.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.974
And from now on, we're the guys
who are gonna make you look

19:27.083 --> 19:29.211
like a hero in front of Bentley!

19:29.285 --> 19:31.777
You're going to be the best mouse hunter
in the West!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.582
- Cunning!
- Ruthless!

19:33.890 --> 19:34.914
Well-behaved!

19:35.325 --> 19:37.487
We're all gonna pretend, see?

19:41.231 --> 19:42.130
[meows]

19:42.565 --> 19:44.158
[all laughing]

19:46.302 --> 19:48.771
We're gonna make it look like
you solved

19:49.139 --> 19:51.164
[imitating Bentley] the
"horrible mouse infestation."

19:51.474 --> 19:54.171
And you are going to make sure
your brothers stay safe.

19:54.344 --> 19:55.175
Got it?

19:56.946 --> 19:57.777
[Jerry skidding halt]

19:58.481 --> 20:00.313
["Cowboy Up" playing]

20:00.416 --> 20:04.182
<i>Lots of fetters out there,
they want to be cowboys</i>

20:04.654 --> 20:08.522
<i>From the Pecos on up to Illinois</i>

20:08.992 --> 20:11.461
<i>Have to dust off all that city</i>

20:44.561 --> 20:48.555
<i>Some beans and bacon
And a rope are all required</i>

20:48.898 --> 20:51.492
<i>A tin you need to pan for gold</i>

21:01.811 --> 21:04.246
Whoa! Hold on there, little doggies.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.876
Now, where was I?

21:06.516 --> 21:08.814

21:58.201 --> 21:59.930
<i>And to the cowboys of the future</i>

Back down in that hole, boys.

22:39.609 --> 22:44.103
<i>You gotta cowboy up</i>

22:53.456 --> 22:55.447
- Howdy, Loretta.
- Howdy, Duke.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.817
[babbling]

22:58.494 --> 23:00.485
Well, will you listen to that.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.530
[continues babbling]

23:02.632 --> 23:05.363
Oh, it's just baby talk. [chuckles]

23:05.601 --> 23:07.126
Oh, you mark my words.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.668
That little feller's gonna be
yippin' in no time.

23:12.608 --> 23:14.508
Well, how bad is it?

23:14.677 --> 23:15.872
Bad, Duke.

23:16.112 --> 23:18.877
And I've planned prairie dog towns
all over the West.

23:19.015 --> 23:23.384
We've got predators threatening
from the North, the East, and the South.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.954
[intense music playing]

23:26.489 --> 23:29.186
[panicking] Look at 'em, out there.
Horrible things.

23:29.459 --> 23:32.156
I spied one once before,
in a cornfield in Kansas.

23:32.228 --> 23:33.127
Oh, uh, me too.

23:33.196 --> 23:35.858
Seen one amongst some string beans
near the city of Ogallala.

23:36.132 --> 23:37.497
Oh, I've seen 'em too.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.169
- But this is different.
- How's that, Jane?

23:40.403 --> 23:43.031
- They're organized.
- Sheriff,

23:43.206 --> 23:46.870
I reckon you're the wisest,
bravest, most cool-headed of us all.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.735
What do you think we ought to do?

23:50.480 --> 23:52.471
Big Tim, George, Zeb!

23:52.548 --> 23:55.142
You three run out there
and see what they want. Go!

23:55.518 --> 23:56.349
[all] Us?

23:56.686 --> 23:57.744
What about you?

24:00.656 --> 24:03.318
[sighs] Okay, I'm going to be
honest with you.

24:03.926 --> 24:05.018
It don't look good.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.355
Sheriff's run off.

24:06.763 --> 24:08.925
And there's something going on
that I don't understand.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.732
But what I do know is this...

24:12.235 --> 24:15.603
We're prairie dogs. And prairie dogs
look out for each other.

24:15.872 --> 24:16.703
Ain't that so?

24:16.839 --> 24:19.274
[all] Yip. Yip. That's right, Duke.

24:19.509 --> 24:21.204
Every one of you here's got a family.

24:21.444 --> 24:23.503
And those families, they need mounds,

24:23.579 --> 24:26.207
holes and burrows
to live in and stay safe.

24:26.449 --> 24:28.884
Zeb, how many you got
in your family now?

24:29.051 --> 24:31.213
Well, golly, let me think.

24:31.554 --> 24:35.548
Well, there's Mom, Dad,
Granny, of course.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.624
Karen and Mike and their kids.

24:37.727 --> 24:40.128
So, uh, let's see...
[murmuring incoherently]

24:42.298 --> 24:44.630
Oh, 26,245.

24:44.934 --> 24:46.959
And 172 more due in April.

24:47.103 --> 24:49.868
And not all of us has got
a small family like Zeb.

24:50.039 --> 24:52.303
We need room
for our great town to grow.

24:52.442 --> 24:54.410
- What's your plan, Duke?
- My plan?

24:54.944 --> 24:56.537
If we can't go that way,

24:57.146 --> 24:58.875
then we go that way.

24:59.048 --> 25:00.038
[inspiring music playing]

25:00.950 --> 25:04.409
You heard Duke. Those tunnels
aren't gonna dig themselves, boys.

25:04.787 --> 25:06.221
[excitedly] Let's burrow.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.425
[sighs contentedly] You don't get
sunsets like this back in the city.

25:16.499 --> 25:19.730
Uh, nope. I kind of forgot
how beautiful they are.

25:20.136 --> 25:21.160
Just think, Bentley.

25:21.471 --> 25:23.735
A month ago, you were ready
to sell this place.

25:23.906 --> 25:25.635
Well, a month ago,
I never would've believed

25:25.741 --> 25:27.436
the Double UB could
look this good again.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.843
Almost like back when we were kids.
With Gramps.

25:31.247 --> 25:33.773
Ooh, your Grandpa loved this ranch.

25:33.850 --> 25:35.909
He got offers on it
over the years, you know.

25:35.985 --> 25:37.350
Always turned them down, though.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.012
Said it was meant for you two.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.613
A place for you two
raise your own families.

25:43.826 --> 25:45.021
[mellow music playing]

25:47.430 --> 25:48.261

[creaking]

27:09.045 --> 27:09.910
[comical music playing]

27:11.714 --> 27:13.045
Will you look at that.

27:14.717 --> 27:18.017
- That reminds me of the fireworks!
- The fireworks!

27:18.354 --> 27:20.413
- [Bentley] Every holiday.
- [Betty] Every birthday.

27:20.523 --> 27:22.389
And don't forget cattle drives,

27:22.592 --> 27:23.957
starting and finishing.

27:24.126 --> 27:25.855
Gramps always set off fireworks

27:25.928 --> 27:27.555
and fired the cannon to celebrate.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.389
"Gotta get things started
with a bang," he always said.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.431
Let's do it!

27:31.601 --> 27:32.932
[Bumpy] Hey, slow down.

27:33.035 --> 27:33.968
Slow down.

27:34.103 --> 27:35.298
Our work's not done yet.

27:35.638 --> 27:37.538
There's 200 head of cattle over there.

27:37.773 --> 27:40.606
They're going to bring in enough money
to keep the Double UB going.

27:40.776 --> 27:42.801
But we've got to get them
to market first.

27:42.979 --> 27:43.810
You're right.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.472
Work now, celebrate later.

27:45.948 --> 27:47.541
Now, hold on.

27:47.717 --> 27:49.879
Didn't I just say your Grandpa
set off fireworks

27:49.952 --> 27:52.250
before and after every cattle drive?

27:52.321 --> 27:56.224
Well, [chuckling] this is before,
but only one.

27:56.559 --> 27:58.926
Bentley and me are gonna be up
early tomorrow morning.

27:59.228 --> 28:01.253
- Uh, we are?
- Yes.

28:01.464 --> 28:04.058
Before I ride with a city feller
on a cattle drive,

28:04.133 --> 28:07.125
I wanna make good and sure
he knows his way around a horse.

28:08.638 --> 28:09.503
[hissing]

28:13.976 --> 28:15.239
- [thud]
- [screams]

28:15.678 --> 28:16.577
[hissing continues]

28:19.982 --> 28:20.847
[firecrackers bursting]

28:32.128 --> 28:32.959
[bursting continues]

28:40.269 --> 28:41.464
- [trembling]
- [snorting impatiently]

28:41.671 --> 28:42.536
[neighs loudly]

28:42.638 --> 28:43.469
[thud]

28:46.475 --> 28:48.136
This one's called Stomper.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.644
He's going to be your horse.

28:50.980 --> 28:51.811
[snorts unhappily]

28:53.315 --> 28:54.146
[thud]

28:58.521 --> 28:59.886
- Stomper?
- Yes, sir.

29:00.289 --> 29:02.621
We got ourselves a long ride to Abilene.

29:02.792 --> 29:05.124
And I wanna make sure
you've got a horse

29:05.294 --> 29:06.386
that won't give any trouble.

29:06.696 --> 29:09.722
- But... Stomper?
- Give him a carrot.

29:10.132 --> 29:11.327
He loves carrots.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.163
[fakes loud biting sound]

29:14.704 --> 29:15.899
Oh, what about that one?

29:18.040 --> 29:18.905
Clementine?

29:19.175 --> 29:20.006
Hah!

29:20.476 --> 29:23.537
Uh, no, you don't want to
ride Clementine.

29:23.879 --> 29:26.041
I do. I do want to ride Clementine.

29:26.649 --> 29:28.083
[hesitates] Look here, son. I...

29:28.250 --> 29:29.308
No more talking about it.

29:29.385 --> 29:30.511
I've made my decision.

29:31.654 --> 29:32.519
[mellow music playing]

29:35.725 --> 29:38.092
Sure you still remember
how to ride, city boy?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.852
If you want, I can still
get Stomper for you.

29:41.063 --> 29:43.225
Oh, go ahead, you two.
Joke all you want.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.096
But Clementine and me
are gonna get along just fine.

29:48.571 --> 29:52.940
Well, then, I've got
one piece of advice. Whatever you do...

29:53.042 --> 29:53.941
Come on, girl.

29:54.510 --> 29:55.341
[angry neighing]

29:55.878 --> 29:57.107
Don't call her "girl."

29:57.346 --> 29:58.336
[Bentley screaming]

29:58.681 --> 29:59.705
Don't let go, Bentley.

29:59.915 --> 30:01.178
Oh, you think?

30:01.250 --> 30:02.115
[neighing]

30:04.854 --> 30:05.685
[loud crunch]

30:05.755 --> 30:09.191
You try to be helpful, but some folks
just don't want to listen.

30:17.466 --> 30:19.093
[Bentley screaming]

30:19.301 --> 30:23.033
Once that cat gets hold of something,
he does not let go.

30:24.473 --> 30:26.066
[rumbling]

30:28.377 --> 30:29.811
Sound the alarm.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.880
[all] Yip. Yip. Yip.

30:36.285 --> 30:37.616
[skids halt]

30:37.820 --> 30:38.719
[neighs]

30:39.455 --> 30:40.286
[thud]

30:41.590 --> 30:43.217
Bentley, are you all right?

30:43.292 --> 30:45.556
- Is Tom all right?
- Yes.

30:45.628 --> 30:49.622
Yes. I was just, uh, testing
my finally-honed equestrian skills

30:49.832 --> 30:51.926
to, um, see what the horse had in her.

30:52.234 --> 30:53.326
We're... we're fine, right, Tom?

30:53.435 --> 30:54.402
Lovely ride. [chuckles nervously]

30:55.571 --> 30:56.402
[suspenseful music playing]

30:56.605 --> 30:57.436
[Bentley gasps]

31:00.609 --> 31:01.735
Rodents!

31:04.480 --> 31:05.948
Mice, Tom. Mice.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.812
And all this time, I thought
you had the problem under control.

31:09.285 --> 31:13.654
But, no. While you slept,
they invaded. Dangerous packs of mice,

31:13.789 --> 31:15.780
digging holes,
living right beneath our feet.

31:16.025 --> 31:18.619
I'm telling you, Bent,
those weren't mice.

31:18.694 --> 31:20.526
They were just
some prairie dogs, is all.

31:20.763 --> 31:22.288
Oh, Bentley's afraid of those too.

31:22.498 --> 31:25.524
Also rats, shrews, ferrets,
hamsters, hedgehogs, squirrels,

31:25.634 --> 31:27.830
- chipmunks, gerbils, muskrats...
- Betty!

31:28.204 --> 31:29.865
Sorry, I always do that.

31:31.607 --> 31:32.472
Come on, boys.

31:32.541 --> 31:34.031
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

31:35.644 --> 31:36.475
Hello?

31:38.647 --> 31:39.614
Hello?

31:41.150 --> 31:42.174
Hello?

31:45.020 --> 31:45.851
[voice] Yip?

31:45.955 --> 31:46.786
[all shrieking]

31:51.694 --> 31:53.662
- Yip.
- [voice] Yip. Yip Yip.

31:56.065 --> 31:56.896
[swishing]

31:59.635 --> 32:00.864
[intense music playing]

32:05.407 --> 32:06.238
[suspenseful music playing]

32:07.076 --> 32:09.204
Shout if you need help, Uncle Jerry.

32:10.012 --> 32:10.911
Whoa.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.081
Uh-oh.

32:15.317 --> 32:16.807
We've got to get him out of there.

32:18.053 --> 32:20.750
- Uncle Jerry?
- Follow the sound of my voice.

32:21.390 --> 32:24.360
Oh, when this is over,
we're gonna do better, Uncle Jerry.

32:24.526 --> 32:28.190
Yeah. No more sleeping in.
We'll be up before sunrise.

32:28.664 --> 32:30.189
We'll do all the chores.

32:30.266 --> 32:32.564
We're going to make
something of ourselves.

32:32.868 --> 32:33.699
[Jerry laughing]

32:33.869 --> 32:36.031
[all] Uncle Jerry, you're okay.

32:37.907 --> 32:40.035
Bentley, is this really necessary?

32:40.743 --> 32:42.939
Hah! You weren't
down in that pit, Betty.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.376
You didn't see those creatures.

32:44.446 --> 32:47.746
- I'm sure it was very unpleasant, but...
- They have glowing red eyes.

32:47.850 --> 32:49.409
Teeth like razors.

32:49.518 --> 32:51.509
Don't you think you're overreacting?

32:51.720 --> 32:52.846
Just a little?

32:53.122 --> 32:55.250
A teensy-weensy bit?

32:55.357 --> 32:57.416
Overreacting, huh?
[chuckles sarcastically]

32:57.526 --> 32:59.460
I've read firsthand accounts of settlers

32:59.561 --> 33:01.222
who were attacked
by crazed grizzly bears.

33:01.397 --> 33:04.924
Pursued by wolves across frozen lakes.
Hunted down by wildcats.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.034
- This was worse.
- Of course.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.929
Why would I ever think
you were overreacting?

33:10.072 --> 33:12.097
I was lucky to survive it.
That's all I'm saying.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.769
I'll ask Bumpy
to ride into town tomorrow

33:16.879 --> 33:18.870
and have the newspaper run this
in their next edition.

33:20.082 --> 33:20.981
[upbeat music playing]

33:22.918 --> 33:23.783
What the...

33:24.887 --> 33:26.480
I'm here to see the boss.

33:33.495 --> 33:34.326
[snorts in disagreement]

33:35.998 --> 33:39.127
Well, no, I don't have an appointment.

33:50.479 --> 33:52.641
Hah! Think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

33:53.082 --> 33:54.413
[thumping]

33:55.751 --> 33:57.742
Two plus two equals four.

33:57.820 --> 33:58.685
Big deal.

33:59.321 --> 34:00.288
[thumping]

34:01.757 --> 34:02.815
Three plus nine?

34:03.292 --> 34:04.657
Easy, 12.

34:05.027 --> 34:05.994
[impatient thumping]

34:08.297 --> 34:11.197
[Clem] Wait, 14 times 23? Uh... Okay.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.094
Hold on, now. Don't tell me.

34:13.768 --> 34:17.864
I was gonna say 322,
if you'd ever give me a chance.

34:17.973 --> 34:18.838
[door slams]

34:19.007 --> 34:20.100
Stupid horse.

34:21.275 --> 34:22.175
What is it, Clem?

34:22.344 --> 34:23.833
The Bensons' hired hand

34:23.946 --> 34:27.210
dropped this off at the newspaper office
this morning, boss.

34:29.685 --> 34:32.484
- [grunts]
- It's an advertisement.

34:32.554 --> 34:34.487
Yes, Clem, I can see that.

34:34.857 --> 34:36.848
Look, would you mind
standing a little...

34:37.559 --> 34:38.458
Sure, boss.

34:38.627 --> 34:42.324
Maybe just a little... One more.

34:42.398 --> 34:43.991
Just a little farther.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.292
Almost.

34:45.467 --> 34:46.956
Keep going. Keep going.

34:47.136 --> 34:48.194
Nearly there.

34:49.371 --> 34:50.735
[Clem] How's this, boss?

34:50.973 --> 34:53.737
Perfect. Now, about this advertisement.

34:55.511 --> 34:59.709
"Motivated, aggressive cats wanted
for immediate work at the Benson Ranch.

34:59.815 --> 35:01.044
Must hate mice.

35:01.183 --> 35:03.515
Direct inquiries to Bentley Benson."

35:04.386 --> 35:05.854
You know what this means?

35:07.322 --> 35:09.552
- Clem!
- [Clem] Oh, sorry, boss.

35:09.658 --> 35:11.217
No. What does it mean?

35:11.593 --> 35:14.858
It means my scheme
to drive those prairie dogs

35:14.930 --> 35:16.659
onto the Benson property worked.

35:16.732 --> 35:21.431
[Clem] Nobody grabs land unscrupulously
better than you, Mr. Critchley.

35:21.537 --> 35:24.563
"Unscrupulous" oughta be
your middle name.

35:25.274 --> 35:26.867
It's nice of you to say that, Clem.

35:27.276 --> 35:28.937
You may come back in now.

35:29.344 --> 35:34.214
- What's our plan?
- Plan? We deliver the final blow.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.684
I want you to go to the Benson place,

35:36.752 --> 35:38.914
find the deed to the ranch
and destroy it.

35:39.288 --> 35:42.553
I'll produce this phony deed,
claim that the land is mine,

35:42.624 --> 35:46.117
and have Betty Benson
and her brother kicked off it for good.

35:46.628 --> 35:50.724
With all due respect, Mr. Critchley,
there's no way those folks

35:50.799 --> 35:53.359
are gonna let me anywheres
near their place.

35:53.969 --> 35:59.430
Oh, they will. In fact,
they'll welcome you with open arms.

35:59.775 --> 36:04.212
Now, I want you to round up
the meanest, nastiest,

36:04.279 --> 36:07.909
most mouse-hating cats you can find.

36:11.153 --> 36:14.453
I heard, you have
a rodent infestation problem.

36:15.157 --> 36:15.988
[suspicious tune plays]

36:16.258 --> 36:20.752
No rodent escapes the terrible fate
these here cats deliver.

36:21.330 --> 36:22.422
[suspenseful music playing]

36:23.499 --> 36:24.330
[Tom gulps]

36:26.235 --> 36:27.634
This one here is Butch.

36:27.736 --> 36:29.465
Here's the brains of the outfit.

36:30.439 --> 36:31.304
[thud]

36:32.808 --> 36:36.574
Uh, no, wait.
This ones the brains. Meathead.

36:36.645 --> 36:37.476
[buzzing]

36:38.814 --> 36:39.645
[exclaims blankly]

36:40.249 --> 36:41.080
Wait.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.251
Maybe none of 'em is the brains.

36:43.318 --> 36:44.183
Hold on.

36:44.953 --> 36:45.818
Okay. Yeah.

36:46.255 --> 36:49.486
This one's Lightnin',
because he's faster than lightning.

36:52.694 --> 36:54.321
I think, 99% sure.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.362
Don't quote me on it, though.

36:55.464 --> 36:59.594
You get the idea. Butch,
Lightnin', Meathead and Shorty.

37:00.335 --> 37:02.667
They're gonna take care
of your mouse problem.

37:03.172 --> 37:04.196
They weren't mice.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.331
They were just some
little prairie dogs, is all.

37:06.642 --> 37:09.270
[both shuddering] I hate prairie dogs.

37:10.979 --> 37:11.844
[shuffling]

37:12.281 --> 37:14.181
[western tune plays]

37:17.519 --> 37:19.385
So, Butch and Meathead.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.047
[chuckling]
Yeah. They look tough, all right.

37:21.156 --> 37:24.854
They are. They used to hunt,
uh, b... buffaloes.

37:25.194 --> 37:28.323
Yeah, full-sized buffaloes,
out on the plains.

37:29.064 --> 37:30.031
Oh, you don't say.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.523
Here we go.

37:31.733 --> 37:33.497
And... and Lightnin'?
You said he's quick?

37:33.569 --> 37:35.628
Is he quick? Watch.

37:37.539 --> 37:39.132
Lightnin', get the mouse.

37:41.376 --> 37:42.741
Huh! Did you see that?

37:42.844 --> 37:44.471
He got one already.

37:45.414 --> 37:46.347
Where?

37:46.515 --> 37:50.474
Oh, he left it out on the field,
so it wouldn't upset the lady.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.683
Aww, and you must be Shorty.

37:55.724 --> 37:57.692
- [loud crunch]
- [Tom screams in pain]

37:59.494 --> 38:00.484
Bentley, please.

38:00.596 --> 38:01.825
This is too much.

38:02.931 --> 38:04.421
- My sister is right.
- [thud]

38:04.666 --> 38:07.533
You don't get as far as I have
in the cut-throat world of the railroads

38:07.603 --> 38:09.833
without developing
a keen eye for people.

38:11.907 --> 38:15.036
And I can tell you're
a trustworthy sort, Mr., uh...

38:15.110 --> 38:17.204
- What did you say your name was?
- Me?

38:17.546 --> 38:19.378
My name, uh, is, uh...

38:21.049 --> 38:21.914
Sunflower.

38:23.118 --> 38:25.212
Mule... y... toad.

38:25.921 --> 38:27.719
Sunflower Muleytoad.

38:27.923 --> 38:30.221
It's Dutch. And Scottish.

38:31.193 --> 38:33.594
Well, then, Sunflower,
you're a trustworthy man,

38:33.695 --> 38:34.594
I can see that.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.199
But I need to know
that your cats can do this job.

38:37.466 --> 38:39.560
So, I've set up a little test.

38:40.636 --> 38:41.603
Here's how it works.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.568
I will set loose these mice.

38:43.772 --> 38:44.898
[whirring]

38:45.040 --> 38:47.771
Mr. Muleytoad's cats will pursue them
around the obstacles.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.908
If any mouse is able
to reach the cheese,

38:50.545 --> 38:51.910
then I'm afraid,
there's no deal.

38:52.281 --> 38:53.146
Fair enough.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.147
On your marks.

38:54.316 --> 38:55.249
Get set!

38:55.617 --> 38:56.448
Go!

38:56.752 --> 38:57.583
[whirring]

38:58.053 --> 39:00.078
Butch, Meathead. Go get 'em.

39:00.455 --> 39:01.650
[intense music playing]

39:16.138 --> 39:17.731
- [foghorn]

39:35.624 --> 39:36.682
[whirring continues]

39:38.260 --> 39:39.989

- Shorty, you're up.

39:41.163 --> 39:41.994

39:56.211 --> 39:57.542
[punches landing]

40:00.549 --> 40:03.382
Wow. Did you see that?
These cats are the real thing.

40:03.518 --> 40:05.543
It's not over yet, Bentley. Look.

40:09.024 --> 40:10.549
Lightnin', let's finish this.

40:12.527 --> 40:13.653
[bones crack]

40:18.667 --> 40:19.657
[bouncing]

40:24.306 --> 40:25.137
[dramatic music playing]

40:46.995 --> 40:49.760
You're hired. You can bunk out
in the barn and start tomorrow.

43:30.692 --> 43:34.595
[laughs] They should have never
fooled with us. Right, uncle Jerry?

43:41.369 --> 43:42.495
[Clem] Got you.

43:44.272 --> 43:46.331
There's your culprits, Mr. Benson.

43:46.675 --> 43:48.336
Oh, they look vicious.

43:48.577 --> 43:51.774
Oh, they are. Probably rabid too.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.104
Really?

43:55.417 --> 43:57.943
Bentley, they're just mice.
Harmless mice.

43:59.788 --> 44:03.247
Begging your pardon, ma'am,
but I've seen so-called

44:03.358 --> 44:05.850
"harmless critters"
just like these here,

44:05.927 --> 44:08.123
lay whole towns to waste.

44:08.396 --> 44:12.458
Ever heard of the bustling metropolis
of Grand Mesa, Oklahoma?

44:12.567 --> 44:15.798
- No, I can't say that I have.
- My point exactly.

44:16.304 --> 44:19.069
Well, then, thank goodness
you showed up here to help us out.

44:19.374 --> 44:21.433
Tell me what we owe you
and you can be on your way.

44:21.977 --> 44:23.775
Oh, I can't take your money,

44:24.079 --> 44:27.811
because the job ain't done.

44:28.383 --> 44:32.980
- It's not?
- No, sir. For every mouse you see,

44:33.088 --> 44:37.150
there's two or three thousand
more hiding all around you.

44:37.392 --> 44:39.053
That's where they got the expression,

44:39.160 --> 44:41.424
"the tip of the miceberg."

44:41.563 --> 44:45.227
Me and the cats, we got
lots more work to do here.

44:45.834 --> 44:49.930
Hmm. We'll be on the trail for weeks,
getting the cattle dabbling, Betty.

44:50.005 --> 44:51.495
We could have Sunflower stay here

44:51.606 --> 44:53.472
and keep an eye on the ranch
while we're gone.

44:53.808 --> 44:54.741
Who?

44:54.909 --> 44:57.776
Oh, I mean, sure. I'm your man.

44:58.079 --> 45:00.309
I'll go take care of these ones.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.114
Uh, what do you mean,
"take care of them"?

45:05.253 --> 45:06.652
Absolutely not!

45:06.788 --> 45:08.654
What came over you in the city, Bentley?

45:08.957 --> 45:10.948
Don't you remember what
Gramps always told us?

45:11.426 --> 45:14.327
Out here, there's room enough
for everyone to find a home.

45:14.829 --> 45:16.695
I'll take them far away from the ranch.

45:17.032 --> 45:18.830
But we're letting them go.

45:22.937 --> 45:24.132
I packed up a few things.

45:24.606 --> 45:26.301
Your tools, some clothes,

45:26.941 --> 45:28.204
and biscuits, of course.

45:28.677 --> 45:30.338
I'm so sorry, boys.

45:30.679 --> 45:31.840
My brother...

45:32.047 --> 45:33.310
Well, he'll come around.

45:33.448 --> 45:34.313
I know it.

45:34.482 --> 45:37.543
In the meantime,
just stay close and stay safe.

45:38.286 --> 45:41.847
If you get into trouble, you make
for one of them prairie dog holes.

45:42.057 --> 45:43.218
Ain't no place safer.

45:43.458 --> 45:45.620
We'll get you back home. I promise.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.300
I'd sing you all some cowboy
songs if I had a guitar,

45:55.904 --> 45:57.838
and I knew how to play.

45:58.206 --> 46:00.834
- Or sing.
- What cowboy songs do you know?

46:01.176 --> 46:04.703
Okay, if I knew any cowboy songs,
then I would sing them.

46:04.979 --> 46:08.040
You know, it's almost as entertaining,
just hearing you explain.

46:09.651 --> 46:11.676
[howling]

46:12.987 --> 46:14.079
[barking]

46:16.024 --> 46:17.219
[gasps] What was that?

46:17.492 --> 46:18.857
[eerie music playing]

46:26.267 --> 46:27.564
[growling]

46:28.536 --> 46:29.367

46:32.741 --> 46:33.731
[mice screaming]

46:38.012 --> 46:39.275
[yelling] Run!

46:40.615 --> 46:41.946
[Tuffy] Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

46:42.083 --> 46:43.073
We're perfectly safe.

46:43.218 --> 46:45.880
There's no way that thing can hurt us,
with that cage on his head.

46:45.954 --> 46:46.921
You're right.

46:47.088 --> 46:48.055
Look at you.

46:48.189 --> 46:50.055
You're feeling pretty embarrassed
right now, aren't ya?

46:50.225 --> 46:51.693
[straining]

46:52.527 --> 46:53.426
[chuckles]

46:55.797 --> 46:56.628
[all screaming]

47:01.703 --> 47:03.034

[screaming]

47:11.412 --> 47:12.902
[rumbling]

47:13.047 --> 47:15.141
Settle down, everybody. Settle down.

47:16.050 --> 47:18.951
After many hours of studying
the mysterious object

47:19.053 --> 47:21.545
before you, we have discovered...

47:21.790 --> 47:23.155
it is food!

47:24.993 --> 47:25.983
[slurps]

47:26.127 --> 47:29.119
Mm. It's got a metallic flavor to it.

47:29.330 --> 47:31.765
Most likely it's an acquired taste.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.801
That... The food is on the inside.

47:35.136 --> 47:37.332
By golly, where's your common sense?

47:37.806 --> 47:40.776
The problem is, how do
we open the durned thing?

47:41.075 --> 47:42.338
Let Big Tim do it.

47:42.744 --> 47:46.237
[indistinct chatter]

47:46.681 --> 47:47.944

48:07.535 --> 48:08.832
Intruders!

48:08.937 --> 48:11.031
Who are you?
What are you doing down here?

48:18.613 --> 48:20.012
[triumphant music playing]

48:25.787 --> 48:27.516
It's... good!

48:30.992 --> 48:32.721
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

48:32.894 --> 48:34.225
This here's my wife,

48:34.329 --> 48:36.161
and this is my daughter.

48:37.031 --> 48:38.294
Well, hello!

48:38.700 --> 48:40.134
- [giggles]
- [Duke] Hey, y'all!

48:40.501 --> 48:42.469
Is everybody having a good time?

48:42.971 --> 48:44.496
[chattering] Yip, yip, yip...

48:44.806 --> 48:46.137
Well, we got these fellers

48:46.207 --> 48:48.039
to thank for that. [chuckles]

48:48.676 --> 48:52.909
Now, let's talk about our town,
the place we call home.

48:53.181 --> 48:55.240
It's always been a peaceful place,

48:55.350 --> 48:57.580
but lately,
we've been missing something...

48:58.052 --> 48:59.542
A proper sheriff.

48:59.821 --> 49:03.758
Well, tonight, I think we found one!

49:03.892 --> 49:06.918
- I call for a vote!
- I second the motion.

49:07.161 --> 49:08.060
All right, then.

49:08.263 --> 49:10.231
All those in favor of making this here

49:10.331 --> 49:11.924
friend of the prairie dog community

49:12.033 --> 49:13.865
our new sheriff, say yeah!

49:14.002 --> 49:16.198
[all cheering] Yip! Yip!

49:16.604 --> 49:17.571
Opposed?

49:18.006 --> 49:18.996
Yip.

49:20.008 --> 49:21.203
The "yips" have it.

49:21.276 --> 49:23.711
We got ourselves a new sheriff!

49:24.012 --> 49:25.844
Welcome to your new home.

49:25.914 --> 49:27.905
["You're Movin' In With Us" playing]

49:31.452 --> 49:32.942

You're moving in with us</i>

51:23.064 --> 51:25.726
[all cheering]

51:30.471 --> 51:32.565
I feel good knowing
that while we're on the cattle drive,

51:32.740 --> 51:36.506
we're leaving the Double UB
under the watchful eye of Mr. Muleytoad.

51:36.577 --> 51:37.510
Who?

51:37.678 --> 51:39.077
Oh, yes, sir.

51:39.213 --> 51:41.181
You folks go sell your cattle.

51:41.315 --> 51:44.512
I promise, when you get back,
you won't have a ranch

51:44.585 --> 51:46.212
to worry about no more.

51:46.354 --> 51:47.321
Pardon me?

51:47.422 --> 51:51.256
That is, you won't have to
worry about the ranch no more.

51:51.826 --> 51:54.761
Well, then, we've got a long,
rough trail ahead of us.

51:55.263 --> 51:58.824
But I reckon we're about
as ready as we'll ever be.

51:59.067 --> 52:01.331
Let's get these critters to Abilene!

Did anybody let the cows
out of the corral?

52:12.880 --> 52:14.678
Ah. Wait here.

52:16.184 --> 52:18.414
[triumphant music playing]

52:29.397 --> 52:30.592
Well, that was weird.

52:30.932 --> 52:32.593
Let's find that deed.

52:49.317 --> 52:50.716
Hold on, everybody.

52:50.785 --> 52:51.980
Tom found it.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.714
This is a letter from great aunt Millie.

52:55.556 --> 52:57.388
This is a shopping list.

53:27.455 --> 53:29.287

53:32.927 --> 53:35.453
[Clem groans] Oh! No deed.

53:35.696 --> 53:37.164
I can't understand it.

53:37.431 --> 53:40.799
Not like a jackalope came in here
and took it or something.

53:42.537 --> 53:45.700
Don't tell me.
You never heard of a jackalope?

53:47.341 --> 53:49.173
No one knows where it came from,

53:49.310 --> 53:51.972
and few who've seen it
have lived to tell the tale.

53:53.314 --> 53:55.112
It takes the form of a jackrabbit.

53:55.183 --> 53:56.207
This tall,

53:56.317 --> 53:59.309
with antelope horns
and rattlesnake teeth.

54:01.355 --> 54:03.949
And they say that
on nights like these,

54:04.158 --> 54:05.717
when the moon is full,

54:05.993 --> 54:07.688
the jackalope appears,

54:07.795 --> 54:11.288
moving across the prairie
with a single purpose,

54:11.532 --> 54:14.866
to hunt down its favorite prey...

54:15.236 --> 54:16.499
Cats!

54:48.836 --> 54:49.826
[thumps]

54:58.079 --> 55:00.741
It's a harmless prairie chicken,
I tell you. Look!

55:00.881 --> 55:04.909
- Here's his beak.
- Now, son, that ain't a beak.

55:05.086 --> 55:06.247
It's fangs.

55:06.954 --> 55:08.854
This fella's a sidewinder.

55:09.023 --> 55:11.287
Whoever heard of a snake with arms?

55:11.392 --> 55:13.520
Well, whoever heard
of a chicken with teeth?

55:13.694 --> 55:16.186
Pa, Curly, stop your bickering.

55:16.264 --> 55:17.959
The sheriff will know
what to do with him.

55:18.065 --> 55:19.590
Good thinking, hon.

55:24.405 --> 55:25.634
[rumbling]

55:34.782 --> 55:36.307
Sheriff, we got something here

55:36.450 --> 55:37.975
you and the deputies ought to see.

55:38.152 --> 55:39.586
It's a sidewinder.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.279
It's a prairie chicken.

55:41.389 --> 55:43.255
[all] It's our brother!

55:47.962 --> 55:49.760
Why aren't you back at the ranch?

55:49.830 --> 55:51.594
Are Betty and Bentley with you?

55:51.899 --> 55:53.094
What happened?

55:59.307 --> 56:02.072
Muleytoad's up to
something bad, Uncle Jerry.

56:02.176 --> 56:05.077
Oh, yeah. Just wait till
Betty and Bentley and Bumpy get back.

56:05.146 --> 56:06.136
Then he'll be sorry.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.304
That'll be too late.

56:07.581 --> 56:09.140
Our family needs us now!

56:18.626 --> 56:20.094
But what can we do?

56:20.161 --> 56:22.027
Those cats are stronger than us.

56:22.363 --> 56:23.626
Faster than us.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.193
Meaner than us.

56:28.469 --> 56:29.459
[thud]

56:31.772 --> 56:33.035
We need a plan.

56:33.140 --> 56:36.166
[laughing] There you are.

56:36.277 --> 56:38.006
She's a-looking for you, you know.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.271
Who is, old timer?

56:39.347 --> 56:41.042
Well, old Sally and me,

56:41.148 --> 56:43.276
we was diggin' over yonder that way.

56:43.384 --> 56:44.545
And I says to Sally,

56:44.652 --> 56:47.713
"Sally, maybe we should ought
to dig over that way

56:47.822 --> 56:51.053
and see what we find there." [laughing]

56:52.326 --> 56:56.354
Yeah, course, when I was a young man,
I didn't dig so much as I do now.

56:56.831 --> 56:59.323
Back then, yeah,
me and my wife, Ethel,

56:59.400 --> 57:01.630
we had us a little burrow outside of it.

57:01.702 --> 57:03.136
Wait. Who is?

57:03.237 --> 57:05.331
- Who's what?
- Looking for us.

57:05.806 --> 57:07.137
She is. [laughs]

57:12.413 --> 57:14.177
[kissing]

57:14.648 --> 57:15.547
[whispers]

57:17.351 --> 57:18.648
[whispers]

57:18.986 --> 57:21.683
Boys, I think we just got our plan.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.055
[thunder rumbling]

57:34.101 --> 57:36.092
Hmm. It's almost right.

57:36.270 --> 57:38.500
- The ears aren't long enough.
- Need sharper teeth.

57:38.572 --> 57:40.768
More antlers, I'm telling you.
More antlers.

57:41.242 --> 57:42.368
[thunderclap]

57:46.547 --> 57:48.106
Ah. Not bad.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.216
[Critchley] One piece of paper, Clem.

57:56.857 --> 57:58.382
That's all you had to do.

57:58.626 --> 58:00.754
Find one piece of paper!

58:01.595 --> 58:04.565
Yeah, but the deed
just ain't there, boss.

58:04.899 --> 58:09.029
Maybe you should just, you know... Uh...

58:09.603 --> 58:10.729
Pardon me?

58:10.805 --> 58:13.240
- Nothing.
- No, Clem. Tell me.

58:13.441 --> 58:15.375
Maybe I should just...

58:15.776 --> 58:16.709
Uh...

58:16.777 --> 58:18.768
Buy the ranch from them.

58:19.213 --> 58:22.478
- [thunderclap]
- Buy it? Buy it?

58:23.050 --> 58:25.246
I tried to buy it
from their grandfather.

58:25.453 --> 58:27.148
He turned down every offer.

58:27.321 --> 58:29.619
He said no amount
of money was enough.

58:29.757 --> 58:30.986
Do you know why?

58:31.125 --> 58:32.820
He said it was their...

58:33.327 --> 58:34.624
home.

58:35.229 --> 58:37.220
He turned down money.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.960
What kind of a man does that?

58:40.468 --> 58:42.095
Now get back out there

58:42.770 --> 58:47.503
- and find that deed!
- [thunder rumbling]

58:51.512 --> 58:52.673
[thunderclap]

58:59.353 --> 59:00.411
[screeching]

59:06.927 --> 59:08.190
[screams]

59:13.000 --> 59:16.368
There's something
strange going on here.

59:20.708 --> 59:22.642
Who would have guessed
that a cat dressed

59:22.710 --> 59:24.303
as a jackalope wouldn't work?

59:24.512 --> 59:25.946
It was just one battle.

59:26.013 --> 59:27.344
We'll figure out a way.

59:27.648 --> 59:28.706
Uncle Jerry's right.

59:28.883 --> 59:30.351
We need reinforcements.

59:30.618 --> 59:33.451
Well, if we didn't have those
predators to deal with...

59:36.223 --> 59:37.520
We'd be right there with you.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.320
[whispering]

59:39.860 --> 59:41.988
Boys, we've got work to do.

59:42.162 --> 59:45.291
Oh, Betty and Bentley are gonna be
pretty surprised when they get home.

59:50.004 --> 59:50.869
[Bumpy] <i>Ah!</i>

59:51.071 --> 59:53.699
<i>Did anybody remember
to get our money for the</i> carro?

59:54.842 --> 59:56.742
<i>Wait here.
I'll be right back.</i>

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:02.543
<i>Okay, then, let's go home.</i>

01:00:11.258 --> 01:00:15.092
I tried. I really did.
You know that, right?

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.990
But the boss don't care about that,
or about me, or you.

01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:25.062
All he cares about is more land.
More, more, more!

01:00:26.907 --> 01:00:29.205
You guys are the best. Really.

01:00:29.276 --> 01:00:32.268
I know I don't say it
near enough, but you are.

01:00:33.747 --> 01:00:36.375
You know what?
I'm going to make us a nice dinner.

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:38.018
[all slurp]

01:00:38.085 --> 01:00:40.110
Where did those recipes get to?

01:00:40.354 --> 01:00:44.450
Let me see. "Biscuits, biscuits,
another biscuits."

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.583
I've never seen so many biscuit recipes.

01:00:46.694 --> 01:00:48.856
"Rhubarb pie, meat loaf,

01:00:48.929 --> 01:00:51.591
deed to the ranch,
pineapple jardiniere..."

01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:54.765
[gasps] Deed to the ranch!

01:00:55.703 --> 01:00:58.104
- [prairie dog] Yip.
- Nice work. Next.

01:00:58.472 --> 01:00:59.769
- Yip.
- That's right.

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.773
Nothing to be afraid of. Next.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:04.776
- Yip.
- So, they're not predators?

01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:07.313
Nope. They use him to scare off crows.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:10.076
Of course, they do.
Those things are terrifying.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.743
That's what we're counting on.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.910
What is it now?

01:01:17.057 --> 01:01:19.287
Hah! It's scarecrows.

01:01:19.393 --> 01:01:22.294
The boss and I put 'em out there
to scare the prairie dog...

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.288
Wait a second. I could have sworn...

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.827
Number three and number 14, move!

01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:34.066
Numbers two, five, 11, and 22, move!

01:01:38.646 --> 01:01:40.512
We just need to stay calm.

01:01:40.681 --> 01:01:43.082
There's no way they can get us in here.

01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:45.648
We're under attack!

01:01:56.864 --> 01:01:57.831
Predators!

01:01:59.099 --> 01:02:00.260
They got Frank!

01:02:03.037 --> 01:02:04.766
[scoffs] I owe you.

01:02:04.838 --> 01:02:08.797
They don't know what hit 'em.
You did it. The ranch is saved.

01:02:10.878 --> 01:02:12.505
Retreat! Retreat!

01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:20.047
[bees buzzing]

01:02:33.133 --> 01:02:34.498
[boom]

01:02:37.237 --> 01:02:39.729
[popping, whistling]

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:44.501
Wait! The deed!

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.585
Take that, you varmint!

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:57.749
- Whoo-hoo! We showed 'em!
- [chuckles] We sure did.

01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:13.897
Sunflower Muleytoad.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.074
Did anyone else think
that was an odd name?

01:03:20.414 --> 01:03:23.850
Well, on the bright side,
you made a good profit on your carro.

01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:25.385
Things could be a lot worse.

01:03:29.123 --> 01:03:31.251
We can bunk out
in the barn for a while,

01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:33.793
hire a few hands
to help us rebuild the house,

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.726
we'll be on our feet in no time.

01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:38.060
You know, Betty, being out here
with you and Bumpy,

01:03:38.132 --> 01:03:40.965
fixing up the old place,
thinking about Gramps,

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:43.765
it reminded me of something
that I almost forgot.

01:03:43.871 --> 01:03:47.205
That "good times or bad times,
we always look out for each other"?

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:49.436
Because we're all family.

01:03:49.543 --> 01:03:52.535
No. It reminded me why I left
for the city in the first place.

01:03:56.483 --> 01:03:59.248
- What?
- Oh, nothing. You were saying?

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:03.045
[sighs] This morning,
I realized I'm no rancher,

01:04:03.123 --> 01:04:05.251
I'm a railroad man,
through and through.

01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:08.989
The steel rails,
the clackety-clack of the, uh...

01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:10.063
Wheels?

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.963
No, no, the other...
The... Oh, you know...

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:15.501
Ah, whatever. It's my destiny.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.661
Okay. Come on, Tom. We have to pack.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.136
We're leaving in the morning.

01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:29.449
Please, Bent, don't leave.

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.648
The Double UB
should sell for a good price

01:04:31.752 --> 01:04:33.117
once you clean things up, sis.

01:04:33.187 --> 01:04:34.746
You can even keep the money.

01:04:34.822 --> 01:04:37.189
I don't want the money.
I want you to stay.

01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:38.486
We need you here.

01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:40.287
Ah, you and Bumpy can manage.

01:04:40.494 --> 01:04:42.155
Soon as you're ready, come to the city.

01:04:42.262 --> 01:04:44.321
I'll have a room waiting for you.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.146
Now, what?

01:05:14.628 --> 01:05:17.859
There they are, Marshal.
I want them arrested immediately

01:05:17.965 --> 01:05:21.902
- Arrested? For what?
- Squatting on my land.

01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:26.199
It seems Mr. Critchley here has a deed
that says he owns this ranch.

01:05:27.241 --> 01:05:29.710
Here it is, all legal and proper.

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:33.337
Critchley, you know darn well
this is the Bensons' land.

01:05:33.413 --> 01:05:35.677
<i>You tried to buy it enough times
from their grandad.</i>

01:05:35.883 --> 01:05:37.681
Is that true, August?

01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:41.881
Poor man was convinced
he owned the entire state.

01:05:41.989 --> 01:05:46.187
I offered a small sum to help relocate.
Charity, really.

01:05:46.493 --> 01:05:49.758
- That's a lie!
- You skunk, you rattlesnake!

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.922
All right, everybody quiet!

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:58.494
[exhales] Now, apologies, ma'am.
Probably just a little misunderstanding.

01:05:58.605 --> 01:05:59.697
[Diablo snorts]

01:06:00.841 --> 01:06:02.502
Well put, Diablo.

01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:05.876
I said, quiet.
Now, Ms. Benson,

01:06:05.946 --> 01:06:07.436
if you could just show me your deed,

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.209
Mr. Critchley and I will be on our way.

01:06:10.517 --> 01:06:14.078
But there was a fire last night.
Everything is gone.

01:06:14.421 --> 01:06:16.412
So, you have no deed.

01:06:16.523 --> 01:06:19.049
They're trespassing, Marshal.
Take them away.

01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:21.453
- This is bad.
- [snaps fingers]

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.622
I have an idea.
We'll need a wheelbarrow, a cannon,

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.859
1,000 prairie dogs, one bull,

01:06:26.934 --> 01:06:30.029
barbed wire, scarecrows,
a thingamabobber...

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:32.399
Marshal, please,
you're making a mistake.

01:06:32.472 --> 01:06:35.464
I don't like it either,
but I've got no choice.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.100
The law is the law.

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:41.579
- Critchley, I oughta...
- Did you hear that? He's threatening me.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.747
Ma'am, I am sorry,

01:06:43.817 --> 01:06:46.377
but unless you have evidence
to the contrary,

01:06:46.453 --> 01:06:48.922
I have to accept Mr. Critchley's claim.

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:50.747
[man] What's going on here, Marshal?

01:06:54.962 --> 01:06:57.260
Bentley, I thought you were going home.

01:06:58.665 --> 01:07:00.463
This is my home.

01:07:06.974 --> 01:07:08.271
[kisses]

01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:23.282
Need some help, Sheriff?

01:07:25.092 --> 01:07:27.493
Yippee yi yip!

01:07:28.328 --> 01:07:31.423
The Prairie Dog Express
rides again!

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.369
I'm going to build a whole town here.

01:07:37.537 --> 01:07:41.770
Critchleyville. No, no. Critchopolis.

01:07:41.842 --> 01:07:43.503
What about your dreams, Bentley?

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.476
You wanted to be a railroad tycoon.

01:07:45.712 --> 01:07:47.373
I was a railroad tycoon.

01:07:47.514 --> 01:07:50.779
A Junior Regional Assistant
Associate trainee railroad tycoon.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:53.282
But it never made me as happy

01:07:53.353 --> 01:07:56.789
as I've been back here
on the Double UB with my family.

01:07:56.957 --> 01:07:58.686
Good to have you back, son.

01:07:59.059 --> 01:08:01.289
If you could just
give us a few days, Marshal,

01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:03.159
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

01:08:04.798 --> 01:08:07.199
The law is the law, Mr. Benson.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.531
And I've got to escort you
off the property right now.

01:08:18.745 --> 01:08:20.509
Yippee yi yip, my friend.

01:08:46.573 --> 01:08:48.564
- [whimpers]
- Say what?

01:08:48.675 --> 01:08:50.234
[continues whimpering]

01:08:50.343 --> 01:08:52.903
- Bentley, what's wrong?
- You should tie him up, Marshal.

01:08:53.113 --> 01:08:54.603
[exclaims]

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.546
Mr. Benson, is something
the matter with you?

01:09:01.621 --> 01:09:04.783
No, I just thought
you might be interested in this.

01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:11.723
"Wanted for bank robbery
and forgery." August Critchley.

01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:14.299
- Forgery?
- Let me see that.

01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:18.533
Aha! The signature
on this deed says

01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:20.095
"Lloyd Benson."

01:09:20.207 --> 01:09:22.368
But Granddad's name wasn't Lloyd Benson.

01:09:22.442 --> 01:09:24.308
It was Boyd Benson.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:26.310
What? They're lying, Marshal.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:28.710
I should know.
I signed that deed myself.

01:09:30.317 --> 01:09:32.752
- Oops.
- Got ya.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:36.050
You're under arrest, Critchley.
You got anything to say?

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:40.790
Just this. [clears throat]
Ride, Diablo, ride!

01:10:02.649 --> 01:10:04.447
Ha, I told you.

01:10:04.518 --> 01:10:08.250
Once that cat gets hold of something,
he does not let go.

01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:16.286
[kisses]

01:10:18.932 --> 01:10:20.866
Gramps would be so proud.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:24.426
It's going to be tough going
for a while, even with the reward money.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.863
I know. But this is home.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.139
Hey, let me get that for you, boys.

01:10:35.182 --> 01:10:36.343
[slurps]

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.845
