12:46.600 --> 12:49.186
You knew this had RHD stamped
on it from jump.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.480
The notorious Money Chandler.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.065
Besides, we hear
you've got your hands full.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.692
They're connected.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.111
Mm. Look forward
to working with you.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.613
Back at you.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.244
[Robertson] Pretty clear
where he came and went.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.915
Similar scene as yours?

13:09.956 --> 13:13.126
Except somehow he missed
killing Chandler outright.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.337
Wouldn't be surprised
she's DOA at the hospital.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.130
Time of death on your double?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.673
Late last night.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.051
Well, this is fresh.
Blood's not dry.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.511
- What's the connection?
- [Bosch] Good question.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.179
She had a meeting this morning.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.598
We'll need a special master
to access her files.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.892
Doing the paperwork as we speak.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.685
Jimmy.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.896
Bullet graze?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.734
[Edgar] Deflected
the first shot

13:37.776 --> 13:39.277
just enough to miss the heart?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.405
Talk about lucky.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.699
If she lives,
she should buy a lottery ticket.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.162
I need to talk to your daughter.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.748
Mind if I listen in?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.959
Usual ground rules apply.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.676
You avoiding me for some reason?

14:03.718 --> 14:05.554
No.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.181
It's the boys. The job...

14:10.350 --> 14:14.354
You've had sons and a job
as long as I've known you.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.606
Whatever's going on with you,

14:16.648 --> 14:18.358
that ain't it.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.697
You usually drive her to work?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.865
No, she usually drove herself.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.201
Why did she need a ride
this morning?

14:28.243 --> 14:31.746
She likes to be driven when she
has a hearing or a deposition.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.707
Helps her focus
on legal strategy

14:33.748 --> 14:35.250
instead of her road rage.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.294
And where was she going today?

14:37.335 --> 14:38.712
She had a deposition.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.046
Downtown, with the SEC.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.548
She was being deposed?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.091
No. One of her clients.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.342
Vincent Franzen.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.474
Vincent Franzen
was being deposed.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.475
Right.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.269
Any idea what about?

14:57.981 --> 15:00.734
I think I'm not supposed
to talk about clients.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.321
We're working on a way
to allow you to do that.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.156
Special master?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.699
That's right.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.458
Is she gonna make it?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.209
She might.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.586
Thanks to you.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.093
I'm really tired.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.638
I think that's enough for now.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.986
I'll have Jerry take you home.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.032
You did great.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.742
She'd be proud of you.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.709
[sighs]

15:59.751 --> 16:00.835
[sniffles]

16:00.877 --> 16:02.379
[door closes]

16:09.761 --> 16:11.388
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.682
Looks like they, uh,

16:13.723 --> 16:15.809
photoshopped your department ID.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.813
Inside job.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.690
Any idea who?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.191
None.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.317
It's all over the Internet?

16:24.359 --> 16:25.443
Well, I'm no Bill Gates

16:25.485 --> 16:28.029
and I found it.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.406
Three keystrokes.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.825
I want to find who did this

16:31.866 --> 16:35.662
and string them up
by their scrotums.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.080
With fishhooks.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.207
Ouch.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.209
Um... yes, ma'am.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.047
[door opens]

16:46.089 --> 16:48.091
[door closes]

17:01.855 --> 17:03.481
You gonna be okay?

17:05.150 --> 17:06.860
Want me to come in?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.655
You have work to do.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.990
Thanks.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.074
Yeah.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.411
And thanks for the ride.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.621
You got somebody you can call?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.625
Yeah. If I need to.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.757
Thanks, Jerry.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.098
[gate creaks]

17:38.266 --> 17:40.435
[gate latches]

17:40.477 --> 17:42.228
From day one,

17:42.270 --> 17:45.899
I have set the safety
of Angelenos as my priority.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.068
LAPD must be both effective
and accountable.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.987
To that end,

17:51.029 --> 17:53.198
I'm appointing former
Deputy Chief Nestor Delgado

17:53.239 --> 17:56.701
to fill Frank Alexander's seat
on the police commission board.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.662
- Chief Delgado?
- [Delgado] Thank you, Mayor.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.290
Protect and serve.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.501
LAPD's motto.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.502
It's time to live up to it.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.544
Make no mistake...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.770
[phone buzzes]

18:26.022 --> 18:27.524
- Chief?
- Understand you're working

18:27.565 --> 18:29.526
the Franzen double
and the Chandler case.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.152
[Bosch] We've got Franzen.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.530
RHD's taking Chandler;
Robertson's the lead.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.824
- How is Chandler?
- In surgery.

18:35.865 --> 18:36.950
Prognosis?

18:36.991 --> 18:38.243
Dicey.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.163
- And the arson case?
- Working it.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.624
Waiting for one of the bombers
to come to Jesus.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.669
After what happened last night
at the women's jail...

18:47.710 --> 18:49.295
Well, probably reassessing
his options.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.588
We'll get him there.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.549
Sure you don't have
more dinner on your plate

18:52.590 --> 18:54.259
than you can say grace over,
Detective?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.763
I can handle it, sir.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.265
Sure you don't want
to call an Uber?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.767
Ah, I got my city ride.
[exhales]

19:02.809 --> 19:04.352
I worry about you
when you drive.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.437
You and the city of Los Angeles.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.690
What's wrong
with the way I drive?

19:08.731 --> 19:09.858
Jimmy.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.317
I was riding with you all day

19:11.359 --> 19:12.652
- and saying my rosary.
- Hmm.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.112
I didn't know you were Catholic.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.697
I'm not.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.906
I drive defensively.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.283
You drive like a New Yorker.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.534
I am a New Yorker.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.952
Point taken.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.246
- Tomorrow I drive.
- Yeah, night.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.081
You go first.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.125
Try not to ding anybody
on the way out.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.752
Eat my dust.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.005
Yeah?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.426
[engine starts]

19:45.727 --> 19:47.228
Feel like a drink?

19:48.730 --> 19:49.898
Sorry.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.190
Not tonight.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.903
[engine starts]

20:03.536 --> 20:05.079
[insects trilling]

20:05.121 --> 20:07.457
She's the best at what she does.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.043
I agree.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.211
She told me once
she hates her nickname.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.130
Just hates it.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.798
I always thought it suited her.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.926
She always was about the money.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.848
Come on, she's...

20:23.890 --> 20:26.059
a lot more than just mercenary.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.770
I know. She defends
the occasional widow and orphan

20:28.811 --> 20:30.939
when there's a big fat
contingency fee

20:30.980 --> 20:32.732
- on the other end.
- No, I know, I know.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.735
She works the system.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.112
No, she plays the system.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.199
Like a billiard table.
Every angle.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.915
Give the devil her due.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.960
She's one tough cookie.

20:55.338 --> 20:58.508
Here's to her. To Money.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.093
To Honey.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.845
To Honey.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.143
[sighs]

21:10.770 --> 21:13.356
[footfalls approaching]

21:13.398 --> 21:15.942
[sighs]

21:19.112 --> 21:21.114
What are you brooding about?

21:23.199 --> 21:26.661
Just conducting
a realistic appraisal

21:26.703 --> 21:28.830
of my future prospects.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.498
And?

21:30.540 --> 21:33.334
Time I started thinking
about what comes next.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.878
[sighs]

21:35.920 --> 21:38.256
Maybe Delgado won't be
so bad as a commissioner.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.091
He's a disaster.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.968
A prime example of a man
who doesn't know

21:42.010 --> 21:43.219
what he doesn't know.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.221
And what he really wants
is my job.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.223
Well, he can have it
after your second term.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.892
What second term?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.437
I'll finish my stint,
she'll make him chief.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.564
[scoffs]

21:54.605 --> 21:57.066
Let's face it, I'm a lame duck.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.777
I love you anyway.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.421
[grunts]

22:38.232 --> 22:39.525
Lieutenant.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.111
You got a minute?

22:42.153 --> 22:44.238
Yeah. Uh, walk with me.

22:46.949 --> 22:50.203
- I saw the picture.
- Yeah, everyone has.

22:50.244 --> 22:53.748
I had my own episode
of this crap.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.750
Used condoms on my windshield.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.878
- Gross.
- Mm. I know, right?

22:58.920 --> 23:00.379
Any idea why they did it?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.381
I mean,
not that they needed a reason.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.258
I didn't want
to date one of them.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.843
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.597
- Happy I didn't.
- I hear that.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.766
[exhales] Any idea who did it?

23:11.808 --> 23:14.727
Me? I'm making a list.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.166
[grunts softly]

23:42.755 --> 23:45.258
- [monitor beeping steadily]
- [filtered breathing]

23:58.062 --> 24:00.648
[woman] [over P.A.] Pediatric
specialist to the NICU.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.025
Pediatric specialist,
please report to the NICU.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.278
So you never changed
a diaper, right?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.696
I've changed a tire.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.573
[Agrawal] Mr. and Mrs. Irving.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.492
- [Irving] Dr. Agrawal.
- I see you have your car seat.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.703
- Very good.
- Is he ready?

24:13.744 --> 24:15.788
I know you're anxious
to bring him home.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.748
- Is something wrong?
- Nothing serious.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.251
James has a mild case
of hyperbilirubinemia.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.087
- Well, it sounds serious.
- Sounds worse than it is.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.006
James has jaundice.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.300
Common in newborns.
Many full-term babies get it.

24:27.341 --> 24:29.260
About 80% of preemies do.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.929
- And what's the treatment?
- Phototherapy.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.890
Light.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.184
A few more days, I promise.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.730
Mm-hmm. Of course.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.356
Uh, looks like
you get a reprieve.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.900
Diaper duty?

24:43.941 --> 24:45.151
Exactly.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.253
I saw Vincent Franzen in court
when he was arraigned,

25:04.295 --> 25:06.797
um, at the office,
meeting with Ms. Chandler.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.133
And when we videotaped

25:09.175 --> 25:11.344
what he was gonna say
to the SEC.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.221
- Also at the office?
- Yes.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.431
And also when I dropped off
a copy of that video

25:15.473 --> 25:18.142
for him to review the night
before the SEC meeting.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.228
- At the Beachwood Canyon house?
- That's right.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.146
The night he was killed.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.066
I guess.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.109
[exhales]

25:27.151 --> 25:30.321
And the video.
What was that about?

25:32.323 --> 25:34.116
You're not violating privilege.

25:34.158 --> 25:38.913
The Special Master has given us
access to her files.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.374
[Maddie] [sighs] Honey-- uh,

25:41.415 --> 25:43.668
Ms. Chandler--
wanted him to rehearse

25:43.709 --> 25:46.629
what he was gonna say
to the SEC.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.464
[Robertson] Any idea
what he was gonna tell them?

25:48.506 --> 25:49.715
Yes. I was in the room.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.552
[Robertson] The entire time?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.346
[Maddie] Yes.

25:55.388 --> 25:58.557
Honey asked me
to run the camera.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.142
And you stayed and listened.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.895
Yes.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.524
So, what was his story?

26:06.565 --> 26:10.194
He wanted to make a deal
on the fraud charges.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.029
The gold bullion scam?

26:12.071 --> 26:15.574
He said he knew about some
gigantic insider trading scheme.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.160
- He name names?
- Just one.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.830
This hedge fund guy.
Carl Rogers.

26:22.665 --> 26:25.042
After he rehearsed
his story, then what?

26:26.335 --> 26:29.714
- I made copies.
- Of the video?

26:29.755 --> 26:32.091
One for Ms. Chandler
and-and one for Mr. Franzen.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.010
- DVDs?
- Thumb drives.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.178
Um, I gave one to her
and I took the other one

26:36.220 --> 26:38.306
to the Beachwood Canyon house
and I dropped it off.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.725
- Did you see Franzen?
- Yes, he answered the door.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.311
And then I gave it to him along
with a laptop to watch it on.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.230
- What time?
- 9:30, quarter of 10:00.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.734
Excuse me a moment.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.408
[door closes]

27:01.120 --> 27:04.248
Did you all recover a thumb
drive and a laptop at Beachwood?

27:04.290 --> 27:05.458
We did not.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.460
How about Chandler's home?

27:07.501 --> 27:09.712
- Find a thumb drive?
- No.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.590
Shooter's got 'em.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.719
No one can know that Maddie

27:16.761 --> 27:18.596
was anywhere near
that videotaping.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.806
You got it.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.478
[door closes]

27:29.398 --> 27:32.485
Instead of coming to me
like a, like a grown-up...

27:32.526 --> 27:34.445
You were going to say
"like a man," weren't you?

27:34.487 --> 27:37.156
Your words, not mine.

27:37.198 --> 27:39.700
...like a grown-up,
she lodges a complaint,

27:39.742 --> 27:41.327
triggers an I.A. investigation,

27:41.369 --> 27:42.745
which we're all
in the fucking middle of

27:42.787 --> 27:45.331
and which is taking up
way too much of my time.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.792
I say let's wait
for the results.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.212
It's gotten worse.
There's been another incident.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.297
And Sergeant Mankiewicz
has opened another 128.

27:53.339 --> 27:57.218
You got absolutely no evidence
my officers--

27:57.259 --> 28:00.262
a-any of my officers-- are
involved in any of this shit.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.515
Don't worry, I'm collecting it.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.810
Oh. Bring it on.

28:05.851 --> 28:10.147
Let's be honest, Billets, you
rub some people the wrong way.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.565
Right back at you, Don.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.943
- Ask anybody...
- [Cooper] Hey, hey.

28:13.984 --> 28:17.154
Let's all just take a step back.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.324
Lieutenant, you have any proof
who's responsible?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.951
I have my suspicions.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.202
But proof?

28:23.244 --> 28:25.538
Not yet, but I will.

28:25.579 --> 28:26.705
There you have it.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.588
Let's wait and see
what I.A. says.

28:34.630 --> 28:38.801
In the meantime,
you two need to play nice.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.806
Let's start with
this hedge fund macher.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.433
Carl Rogers.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.310
Hedge fund guys
don't buy hits on witnesses.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.980
- So what else we got?
- [Bosch] Franzen was about
to spill the beans

28:51.021 --> 28:53.858
on a multimillion-dollar
insider trading scheme.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.276
[Bennett] So he said.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.318
To save his own ass.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.362
Grain of salt, duly noted.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.405
What else connects them?

28:59.447 --> 29:02.366
The shooter. Same M.O.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.659
[Edgar] All in all,

29:03.701 --> 29:05.369
it would be
a big fucking coincidence.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.205
We don't believe
in coincidences. Not like this.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.043
- How is Chandler?
- Stable.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.754
Still critical.
Medically-induced coma.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.214
What are her chances?

29:34.190 --> 29:35.399
Hey.

29:36.484 --> 29:37.651
Hey.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.236
You did good.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.905
Thanks.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.993
You okay?

29:46.035 --> 29:48.704
Yeah.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.581
How is she?

29:50.623 --> 29:53.751
- Any news?
- Spoke to the hospital
this morning.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.169
She's hanging in there.

29:55.211 --> 29:58.756
- She's tough.
- Yeah, she is.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.593
What are her chances, Dad?

30:02.635 --> 30:05.054
And-and don't lie to me.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.017
Not great. Too soon to tell.

30:10.059 --> 30:12.019
But she's been lucky so far.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.313
Lucky? Shot twice?

30:14.355 --> 30:16.106
Bullets missed her heart.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.985
We think the first one grazed
the coffee pot she was holding,

30:20.027 --> 30:21.195
deflected it just enough.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.323
- And the second one?
- Also a little off.

30:24.365 --> 30:27.368
And the shooter was too arrogant
to go confirm his kill.

30:29.411 --> 30:33.249
So, yeah, she's been lucky.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.585
Need a ride?

30:36.627 --> 30:38.128
I'll get somebody
to run you home.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.422
Antonio's picking me up.
Early dinner.

30:40.464 --> 30:43.425
Listen, Mads.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.345
You need to be careful
who you talk to about this.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.806
Even Antonio.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.892
No one can know
you were in that room.

30:53.978 --> 30:54.937
Got it.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.814
Okay.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.112
- Be safe.
- Always.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.199
Get out of here.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.243
- Call me later.
- I will.

31:19.837 --> 31:20.963
So, how'd it go?

31:21.005 --> 31:23.340
It was fine.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.811
Wasn't hard... emotionally?

31:35.853 --> 31:38.105
I just told 'em what I know.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.613
[engine starts]

31:45.654 --> 31:47.156
What smells so good?

31:48.782 --> 31:51.035
You'll see.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.879
[Browne] I only heard her side.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.840
The FBI is "dropping it.

32:04.882 --> 32:08.594
No grand jury. Great news.
Can you believe it?"

32:08.636 --> 32:10.638
- She seemed surprised?
- Definitely.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.139
- Happy about it?
- Oh, yeah.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.932
Relieved.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.518
Anything else? Any names?

32:16.560 --> 32:19.146
No. That's all I got.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.274
Appreciate it.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.742
Uh, here is
your incident report.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.202
Hunter and Lloyd asked
for backup.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.120
And Leonard and Norris
never went code 6.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.789
Left 'em in the lurch.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.207
Thanks.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.751
Uh, who left who in the lurch?

32:40.793 --> 32:42.836
And why didn't I know about it?

32:42.878 --> 32:44.296
And what the hell is
a lurch, anyway?

32:44.338 --> 32:45.798
Cone of silence?

32:45.839 --> 32:48.634
Cono de silencio.

32:48.676 --> 32:50.386
Hunter and Lloyd told me
that they were on

32:50.427 --> 32:52.346
a possible 415 with a gun

32:52.388 --> 32:53.639
and put out a call for backup.

32:53.681 --> 32:56.725
Leonard and Norris
were in the area

32:56.767 --> 32:59.269
and responded to the call...
and never showed.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.063
Oh, that kind of lurch.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.731
Mm-hmm.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.569
[phone rings]

33:10.614 --> 33:12.116
Bosch.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.575
[Jenkins] Bernice Jenkins,
from the Sheriff's,

33:13.617 --> 33:15.202
with Operation Safe Jails.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.787
What can I do for you, Jenkins?

33:16.829 --> 33:18.747
[Jenkins] We're holding
Pedro Alvarez.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.457
He's a suspect
in the arson case, right?

33:20.499 --> 33:21.875
Yeah. He tossed the Molotov.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.335
You mind if I put you
on speaker?

33:23.377 --> 33:25.546
- My partner's sitting here.
- [Jenkins] Go ahead.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.217
What's up with Alvarez?

33:30.259 --> 33:32.219
[Jenkins] Just got off the phone
with his lawyer.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.680
- He wants keep-away status
for his client.
- I'll bet he does.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.057
This come from the lawyer
or Alvarez?

33:37.099 --> 33:39.101
[Jenkins] The lawyer says
his client is requesting it.

33:39.143 --> 33:40.644
- That's all I know.
- Has it been approved?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.438
[Jenkins] Still working it.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.939
- Just thought
you'd want a heads-up.
- I appreciate it.

33:43.981 --> 33:45.816
You do me a solid?
Slow-walk it.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.484
We want to talk to him first.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.570
- [Jenkins] Make him work
for it, huh?
- Exactly.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.114
[Jenkins] We all know the wheels
of justice grind oh so slow.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.115
Thanks.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.367
Have a better one.

33:55.409 --> 33:58.370
- Alvarez heard
about La Mayorista.
- He's seen the light.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.333
[timer beeping]

34:10.674 --> 34:12.134
And this is...

34:12.176 --> 34:15.512
Chicken and andouille gumbo
from Harold and Belle's.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.432
Good food to be had
south of the 10.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.601
You even broke out
the Goodwill china.

34:20.642 --> 34:23.562
Nothing but the best.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.362
Mmm... this is good.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.490
- Not too spicy?
- No.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.825
The sausage gives it some heat.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.452
And there's some Tabasco
if you want.

34:38.494 --> 34:41.371
I'm good.
This is plenty hot.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.833
I never go south of
Gus's Fried Chicken, but...

34:44.875 --> 34:46.168
I might have to reconsider.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.046
Figured you deserved
something special today.

34:49.087 --> 34:54.259
This is special,
but today wasn't so bad.

34:55.803 --> 34:58.347
Still processing
what happened to Chandler?

35:01.058 --> 35:02.226
Processing?

35:02.267 --> 35:05.103
Yeah, like dealing with it
and all.

35:05.145 --> 35:09.358
Yeah, I know
what the word means.

35:09.399 --> 35:13.070
Jesus, Antonio...
it's only been a day.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.822
Of course I'm still
processing it.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.199
Sorry. I just think it'd be good

35:17.241 --> 35:18.200
for you to talk about it.

35:18.242 --> 35:20.661
You know, like, get it out.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.666
Talking about it now.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.376
No, I mean, like,
really talk about it.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.753
Like what she means to you.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.342
Okay, good. Go on.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.094
Tell me how I'm supposed
to feel.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.932
Sorry.

35:41.974 --> 35:45.018
I just spent hours getting
questioned by detectives.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.687
Don't need to be grilled
by my boyfriend.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.858
- Who are you calling?
- Uber.

35:50.899 --> 35:53.986
It's amazing. You get in the
car, you don't say anything.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.612
The driver doesn't say anything.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.322
Next thing you know,
you're home.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.700
- There's no third degree.
- Okay.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.077
Okay.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.371
I'm sorry.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.257
Pass the Tabasco.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.065
I ain't got nothing to say.

36:32.107 --> 36:35.694
La Mayorista didn't talk,
and they killed her anyway.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.195
- How do you know?
- What?

36:37.237 --> 36:39.281
- That she didn't talk.
- What do you know about that?

36:39.323 --> 36:41.867
That's the word.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.536
That she was cutting a deal.
They took her down.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.955
Same shit could happen to you.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.290
I ain't snitching.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.667
Yeah, but word gets out
you're talking to us...

36:50.709 --> 36:52.002
- But I ain't.
- [Edgar] But you are.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.754
Right now.

36:53.795 --> 36:57.424
eMe hears about it? Fuck.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.009
I didn't say nothing.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.178
[Bosch] Don't fucking matter.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.805
eMe's tying up loose ends.
La Mayorista.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.558
You're a loose end, too, Pedro.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.227
eMe doesn't trust you.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.146
No matter how stand-up you are.

37:11.188 --> 37:13.023
Feel me?

37:13.065 --> 37:16.360
Yeah, feel this.
I'm getting transferred.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.196
Yeah, well, that depends on us.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.530
That's not what my lawyer said.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.282
- You need a better lawyer.
- Fuck you!

37:22.324 --> 37:23.742
You and Trejo killed
women and children.

37:23.784 --> 37:26.286
This jail's filled with guys
that'd do you for free.

37:26.328 --> 37:27.871
[Bosch] We know what you want.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.581
Keep-away status,
cell to yourself.

37:29.623 --> 37:33.835
I'm already getting that.
I don't need you, cabrón.

37:33.877 --> 37:37.339
- Keep telling yourself that.
- Here's the thing.

37:37.381 --> 37:41.218
We give the word,
you're going in gen pop.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.469
How long you think you'll last?

37:42.511 --> 37:44.805
Not long.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.473
Not long at all.

37:46.515 --> 37:49.101
You give us what we want,
we'll do the same for you.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.436
Tell us who gave you
the order to firebomb

37:51.478 --> 37:53.313
- that apartment building.
- It was Peña.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.940
We know it was Peña.

37:56.733 --> 38:01.571
We also know he's thinking
about you... right now,

38:01.613 --> 38:04.199
