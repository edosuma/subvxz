00:02.085 --> 00:05.111
Hey, Judith. There's the rock star.
Ready for a fun weekend?

00:05.188 --> 00:06.780
Leave me alone.

00:08.491 --> 00:09.856
Musicians.

00:10.293 --> 00:13.285
Alan, that child is driving me insane.

00:13.363 --> 00:15.297
Like father like son, huh?

00:16.700 --> 00:18.190
Really, that bad?

00:18.802 --> 00:22.863
He's been sullen and uncooperative for
days. I think he needs to see someone.

00:22.972 --> 00:24.633
What, you mean like a shrink?

00:24.708 --> 00:26.903
No, Alan, I mean like a blacksmith.

00:28.378 --> 00:30.573
This is clearly a reaction to our divorce.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.843
He's not processing his emotions
in a healthy way,

00:33.917 --> 00:36.181
and I think therapy
could help unblock him.

00:36.252 --> 00:38.846
- Where did you get that?
- From my therapist.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.685
Who's working wonders with you.

00:42.759 --> 00:44.158
Excuse me?

00:44.427 --> 00:46.725
Who's working wonders with you.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.536
All he does is sit in his room and play
that damn thing. He's isolating, Alan.

00:54.604 --> 00:56.538
That doesn't mean
he needs to see a therapist.

00:56.606 --> 00:59.666
He's a normal 11-year-old kid
who happens to be a little grumpy.

00:59.743 --> 01:03.008
And I'm a normal 35-year-old mother
who is running out of patience.

01:03.079 --> 01:05.069
And by patience I mean Prozac.

01:06.549 --> 01:09.746
Wait a minute.
You can't still be 35, because...

01:12.388 --> 01:14.754
He's getting pretty good at that.

01:15.358 --> 01:17.724
Yeah, well get used to it.

01:40.383 --> 01:43.147
Charlie, what are you doing?

01:45.255 --> 01:46.813
<i>Smoke on the Water.</i>

02:22.859 --> 02:24.121
Okay.

02:25.361 --> 02:27.295
It's not cute anymore.

02:29.465 --> 02:31.126
Make him stop.

02:31.201 --> 02:34.136
You're the one who bought him
the guitar, Charlie.

02:34.537 --> 02:38.530
The bed is vibrating so much up there
I'm no longer necessary.

02:39.576 --> 02:43.512
Well, I'm sorry my son's interrupted
your afternoon debauchery,

02:43.913 --> 02:46.006
but I think he's upset about something.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.674
- What's he upset about?
- I don't know.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.583
I was just giving him a little space
before I talked to him.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.518
You want me to talk to him?

02:53.723 --> 02:56.317
Sure, and I'll finish for you upstairs.

02:58.061 --> 02:59.756
This is a father's job.

03:02.232 --> 03:05.395
Tell him I just need, like, 20 minutes.

03:22.518 --> 03:24.110
Can I come in?

03:29.425 --> 03:32.519
It really sounds like
you've got your mojo working.

03:35.531 --> 03:39.968
But let's try to turn it down now, okay?

03:41.237 --> 03:42.864
What'd you do that for?

03:42.939 --> 03:46.238
Because I love you,
and I don't want that to change.

03:50.613 --> 03:53.275
So how was your week?

03:54.150 --> 03:55.583
Okay.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.643
Anything I need to know?

03:57.754 --> 04:00.052
- Anything bothering you?
- No.

04:00.123 --> 04:02.921
You sure? 'Cause it seems like
something's bothering you.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.892
Okay, you wanna know
what's bothering me?

04:04.961 --> 04:06.292
Yeah.

04:06.396 --> 04:09.058
People keep on asking me
what's bothering me.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.895
- Okay. I won't ask.
- Good.

04:16.439 --> 04:18.964
- You know, when I was your age...
- Oh, man!

04:20.576 --> 04:22.601
Okay, forget that.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.647
- Problems at school?
- No.

04:24.747 --> 04:26.476
- Problems with Mom?
- No.

04:26.582 --> 04:29.517
Because I understand there's some
things a guy doesn't want to

04:29.619 --> 04:32.144
- talk with his mom about.
- Like what?

04:32.255 --> 04:36.624
Well, you know, girl problems,
or somebody's picking on you.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.823
Or you're the only guy in gym class
without hair on his testicles.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.100
She sobered up on you, huh?

04:58.948 --> 05:02.111
No, I'm just being a good host.
And, yeah, a little bit.

05:04.153 --> 05:06.883
- Man.
- Did you figure out what his problem is?

05:06.990 --> 05:09.857
No, but we determined mine
was late-onset puberty.

05:11.494 --> 05:14.190
You were a Mexican hairless, weren't you?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.897
Did you check to see if he's constipated?

05:20.003 --> 05:22.301
His mother and I
are going through a divorce,

05:22.372 --> 05:24.670
and there's a lot of emotions
he hasn't processed.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.700
Maybe so, but there's also a lot of
string cheese he hasn't processed.

05:30.980 --> 05:34.507
You know, Judith thinks
he needs to see a therapist.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.075
Why, 'cause it's working so good for her?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.579
Charlie, that's uncalled for.

05:40.023 --> 05:43.015
Come on. The kid's problem is he's 11.

05:43.359 --> 05:47.420
He can't drive, he can't drink,
and his mother picks out all his clothes.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.491
Be thankful he's not in the garage
biting the heads off of chickens.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.330
But this isn't like him.

05:53.403 --> 05:55.337
Trust your first instinct.

05:55.905 --> 05:59.671
Just give him a little space,
and probably by this time tomorrow...

06:03.880 --> 06:05.780
I will have killed him.

06:24.033 --> 06:28.197
Not bad. But why don't you try fretting
the "E" and the "A" string together?

06:28.371 --> 06:29.861
I like my way.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.206
Cool.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.470
What did you do that for?

06:38.581 --> 06:41.379
Look, I'm really happy you've taken up
an instrument,

06:41.451 --> 06:44.614
and I'll be even happier
when you learn an actual song.

06:45.254 --> 06:48.690
But right now, let's just take a little pause
for the cause.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.416
What do you want?

06:51.494 --> 06:54.019
Nothing. I just thought we could hang out.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.268
A couple of musicians taking five.

07:03.706 --> 07:05.037
Just chilling.

07:06.309 --> 07:08.334
Nothing's bothering me.

07:08.444 --> 07:11.709
That's cool. I'm not trying to harsh
your mellow.

07:14.283 --> 07:18.310
I know there are certain things a guy
doesn't want to talk to his parents about.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.548
- Like what?
- I don't know.

07:20.823 --> 07:22.814
Peer pressure. Bullies.

07:23.493 --> 07:27.054
Skipping class to drive to Tijuana
with the school nurse.

07:32.735 --> 07:37.638
I'm telling you, my youngest once ate
a whole can of Play-Doh.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.801
Stopped her up for two weeks.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.037
Berta, please.

07:42.145 --> 07:44.579
Finally, pooped out an ashtray.

07:46.082 --> 07:48.175
That's the day I quit smoking.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.387
Any luck?

07:56.325 --> 07:59.021
The little snothead kicked me
out of his room.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.525
Welcome to the club.

08:00.596 --> 08:02.393
Yeah, but I'm the cool uncle.

08:02.498 --> 08:04.693
And I'm the uncool dad?

08:04.767 --> 08:07.600
Don't get defensive.
You did the best you could.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.561
That kid has nothing to complain about.

08:10.673 --> 08:13.403
He's never been spanked,
he's never even been yelled at.

08:13.509 --> 08:17.070
And even while my marriage was
collapsing, he always came first.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.341
Well, I'm glad you're not defensive.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.043
He has a great life.
He gets everything he wants,

08:22.118 --> 08:25.884
I deny him nothing. Oh, my God,
what have I done to my son?

08:27.190 --> 08:29.556
Alan, I was kidding. You're a terrific father.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.354
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.793
You're right. I'm always too quick
to blame myself.

08:33.895 --> 08:35.591
- Yes, you are.
- It's his mother's fault.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.960
Attaboy!

08:41.636 --> 08:43.730
Would you like me
to make you a snack, Jake?

08:43.806 --> 08:45.433
I'm not hungry.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.736
You sure?
We've got some pizza left from dinner.

08:47.810 --> 08:50.142
Alan, ease up. He said he's not hungry.

08:50.246 --> 08:51.804
You'll eat when you want to, right?

08:51.914 --> 08:54.644
Would you please not talk?
I'm trying to watch.

08:59.922 --> 09:01.549
This show is stupid.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.450
You're right. Here. You pick something.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.057
Thanks.

09:09.265 --> 09:10.664
Cool uncle.

09:12.835 --> 09:13.995
Stupid.

09:15.004 --> 09:16.062
Stupid.

09:16.939 --> 09:17.963
Boring.

09:18.574 --> 09:19.836
Stupid.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.501
Seen it.

09:23.679 --> 09:24.737
Stupid.

09:25.514 --> 09:26.572
Stupid.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.079
Stupid.

09:30.186 --> 09:31.448
Really stupid.

09:32.622 --> 09:33.816
Stupid.

09:33.923 --> 09:35.015
Dumb.

09:35.124 --> 09:36.250
Stupid.

09:37.093 --> 09:38.287
All right!

09:41.831 --> 09:44.265
Pick a stupid show and live with it.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.201
- Forget it, I'll just go to my room.
- Jake, wait.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.272
Nice going, cool uncle.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.034
Now it's my fault?

09:52.141 --> 09:55.167
Let me tell you something,
between you and your whacko wife,

09:55.278 --> 09:57.644
I'm an oasis of normality around here.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.651
Are you ever gonna come back upstairs?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.587
I'm still an oasis.

10:22.672 --> 10:23.764
Morning.

10:23.839 --> 10:26.330
Morning. Did your guest leave?

10:26.442 --> 10:30.173
No, she's sleeping in.
Please do not let me forget again.

10:30.846 --> 10:33.872
Perhaps you should put a Post-it Note
on your penis.

10:35.618 --> 10:39.213
Yeah, but then I'd have to take down
the sign for the yard sale.

10:41.957 --> 10:44.551
Buddy, I made silver dollar pancakes.

10:44.660 --> 10:46.218
I'm not hungry.

10:46.329 --> 10:48.889
- Come on, they're your favorite.
- I said no.

10:49.198 --> 10:50.529
You know what I was thinking?

10:50.633 --> 10:54.125
Maybe later, we could have a jam session.
You on guitar, me on piano.

10:54.203 --> 10:56.330
I'd rather watch cartoons.

10:57.206 --> 11:00.642
- What is your problem?
- Charlie, calm down.

11:00.710 --> 11:04.009
I'm sorry, but when I was his age,
I had to walk five blocks

11:04.080 --> 11:05.843
in the rain to have a jam session.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.883
Yeah, well, yelling at him isn't gonna help.

11:07.983 --> 11:11.976
I was thinking that maybe the three of us
could go out and do something fun today.

11:12.054 --> 11:13.214
You want fun?

11:13.322 --> 11:17.486
Let's take him to the Rose Bowl Swap
Meet and see what we can get for him.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.686
Or, we could be patient

11:19.762 --> 11:22.822
and maybe eventually he'll tell us
what's bothering him.

11:23.566 --> 11:25.864
Where's my grandson?

11:26.235 --> 11:28.601
Or, we could scare it out of him.

11:30.506 --> 11:34.203
Granted, I don't know what it's like
to be an 11-year-old boy,

11:34.276 --> 11:36.710
but I do know one thing, sweetheart.

11:37.179 --> 11:41.172
You have no idea
what real unhappiness is.

11:43.853 --> 11:47.345
Real unhappiness is
being totally ignored

11:47.423 --> 11:50.051
by the very people you gave birth to.

11:52.294 --> 11:56.924
Real unhappiness is when
you're recovering from liposuction

11:57.967 --> 12:02.404
and your only grandson doesn't even
send you a get-well card.

12:03.372 --> 12:07.706
And FYI, I only had that surgery so
you wouldn't have a grandmommy

12:07.777 --> 12:09.540
with matronly upper arms.

12:11.947 --> 12:15.781
Well, if he didn't need a shrink before,
he needs one now.

12:21.357 --> 12:24.121
I'm telling you, you're spoiling the kid.

12:24.794 --> 12:26.921
I didn't have a shrink
when I was Jake's age,

12:27.029 --> 12:29.862
and my childhood was
twice as screwed up as his.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.933
I mean, you're a little cuckoo, Judith.

12:34.703 --> 12:38.230
But compared to our mother,
you're like a fart in a hurricane.

12:44.780 --> 12:47.214
Mom never took you to see Dr. Demerest?

12:51.153 --> 12:53.883
- You got to see a shrink?
- Just a couple of times.

12:53.956 --> 12:58.086
For the night terrors, agoraphobia,
and bed-wetting.

12:59.161 --> 13:00.287
Did it work?

13:00.396 --> 13:03.456
I can pee outside in the dark.
You be the judge.

13:05.434 --> 13:08.403
You know, Charlie,
if you think I'm cuckoo,

13:08.471 --> 13:11.338
simply because I want to help my child
express his feelings,

13:11.440 --> 13:14.000
well, then I think you have a big problem.

13:24.820 --> 13:29.189
So, Jake. How you liking
that bean bag chair, huh?

13:29.291 --> 13:31.782
- You comfy?
- It's okay.

13:32.661 --> 13:34.856
'Cause we could sit in the little chairs.

13:34.964 --> 13:37.990
You know, sometimes I like to sit
in a little chair.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.295
Makes me feel like a giant.

13:43.706 --> 13:46.004
Hello, Jake.

13:47.009 --> 13:50.137
Well, I can barely see you from up here.

13:55.618 --> 13:59.110
Do you sometimes feel like a small,
insignificant person

13:59.188 --> 14:01.679
in a world full of giants?

14:01.790 --> 14:03.189
Not really.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.984
Well, maybe that's just me.

14:08.163 --> 14:10.757
So anyhow, I was hoping we could talk
for a little bit.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.996
Draw some pictures,
maybe play some games.

14:16.338 --> 14:18.135
Do you like puppets?

14:18.374 --> 14:19.932
Not really.

14:24.513 --> 14:27.175
Neither do I.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.647
But sometimes they help

14:32.721 --> 14:36.885
when I'm in a bad mood!

14:39.328 --> 14:41.694
I hope she gets him
to talk about the divorce.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.790
Yeah, it's a traumatic thing to see
his father kicked out of his house.

14:45.868 --> 14:50.168
It wasn't exactly healthy for him to see
the life being sucked out of his mother.

14:50.239 --> 14:54.733
Excuse me. But that was going on for
years, and he was still a happy little boy.

14:55.878 --> 14:58.870
"He stuck in his thumb
and pulled out a blank. "

15:02.751 --> 15:04.082
Plum, right?

15:05.220 --> 15:08.883
It would be nice if you took a little
responsibility for Jake's problems.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.481
She's right, Charlie.

15:10.559 --> 15:12.754
- Me? What did I do?
- You taught him how to gamble.

15:12.861 --> 15:14.692
You brought strange women
into the house.

15:14.763 --> 15:16.754
You taught him how to curse in Italian.

15:16.865 --> 15:18.492
Your drinking sets a bad example.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.728
Let's get one thing straight.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.665
I taught him how to curse in Spanish.

15:24.773 --> 15:28.834
Okay. Well, Jake and I
had a wonderful talk.

15:28.911 --> 15:31.709
And now I'd like to speak
with the grownups.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.413
Aren't you coming in, Charlie?

15:37.519 --> 15:41.011
No, I'm still trying to find
the toothbrush in the tree here.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.992
Is this Uncle Charlie?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.651
Well, I definitely want to talk
with Uncle Charlie.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.498
Thanks a lot!

15:55.871 --> 15:58.704
No, please, make yourselves comfortable.

16:13.455 --> 16:17.789
Okay, well, Jake and I
had a very nice little talk.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.294
I invited him to share his feelings
with me in a confidential,

16:21.397 --> 16:23.592
non-threatening context.

16:23.699 --> 16:26.190
And after hearing everything
he had to say,

16:26.268 --> 16:28.862
I must tell you very frankly...

16:30.639 --> 16:32.937
Who am I kidding, I got nothing.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.412
That's it? $150 an hour for "I got nothing"?

16:44.420 --> 16:48.083
It's $175. But that's not really
the point now, is it?

16:48.891 --> 16:51.917
- What did he tell you?
- He claims nothing's bothering him.

16:51.994 --> 16:56.055
He claims there's nothing wrong,
but when I probed just a little bit,

16:56.131 --> 16:58.463
<i>he told me to besa mi culo.</i>

17:06.474 --> 17:08.238
You see? Spanish.

17:09.344 --> 17:11.436
I hope you're proud of yourself, Charlie.

17:11.512 --> 17:15.813
He's not a sulky little jerk-wad
'cause he learned a second language.

17:15.917 --> 17:19.115
- See what my son's been living with?
- Only because she threw me out.

17:19.188 --> 17:20.916
What? I have a right to be happy.

17:20.989 --> 17:23.958
Speaking of which,
did I leave that girl at the house?

17:24.026 --> 17:25.492
Shut up, Charlie.

17:25.594 --> 17:27.060
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Calm down.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.565
- I don't even know what he's doing here.
- I'm trying to keep your kid

17:30.632 --> 17:33.123
from turning into a neurotic basket case
like my brother.

17:33.235 --> 17:35.066
Maybe then, he won't marry
a messed up woman.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.071
I'm screwed up
because you're a lousy brother.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.666
- My God, your whole family's insane.
- Hold on, people!

17:42.911 --> 17:45.004
Even cows know

17:45.114 --> 17:47.776
words can hurt.

17:56.191 --> 17:59.683
Jake, you know that even though
your mother and I bicker sometimes,

17:59.795 --> 18:02.127
we will always love you, no matter what.

18:02.197 --> 18:03.255
I know.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.926
And, honey, you also need to know
that our splitting up

18:06.001 --> 18:08.435
- had absolutely nothing to do with you.
- I know.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.438
It's just that Mommy has a right
to be happy.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.133
Yeah, he knows.

18:13.475 --> 18:16.535
And whatever's bothering you,

18:16.645 --> 18:19.546
you know I had nothing
to do with it, right?

18:19.948 --> 18:21.438
- Yeah.
- See?

18:23.385 --> 18:24.977
Can I go to bed now?

18:25.053 --> 18:27.044
Now? Jake, it's only 7:00.

18:27.156 --> 18:28.555
I'm tired.

18:28.657 --> 18:31.820
All right, honey.
I'll come tuck you in before I leave.

18:33.662 --> 18:36.825
- Okay, that's a bad sign.
- It's a symptom of clinical depression.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.491
You would know.

18:40.502 --> 18:43.062
Please, if my kids had gone to bed
at 7:00

18:43.172 --> 18:46.835
I'd have dipped myself in gravy
and danced naked on the rooftops.

18:49.912 --> 18:52.142
She does make a hell of a gravy.

19:01.423 --> 19:04.017
- Morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Morning.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.253
Morning, Dad. Morning, Berta.

19:09.364 --> 19:10.854
- Morning.
- Morning.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.333
So, Dad, what are we gonna do today?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.667
I don't know. What would you like to do?

19:16.905 --> 19:20.500
I don't know, something fun.
Maybe we could jam, Uncle Charlie.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.304
Great.

19:23.178 --> 19:25.646
Dad, can I eat my cereal down by the TV?

19:25.714 --> 19:27.079
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19:30.853 --> 19:32.377
What happened to him?

19:32.855 --> 19:36.188
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear he got laid last night.

19:39.928 --> 19:43.830
I hope you don't mind, but I talked to
him before he went to sleep last night.

19:43.899 --> 19:45.423
What did you say?

19:45.534 --> 19:48.401
I said, drink this bottle of prune juice.

19:52.741 --> 19:55.733
You feed him nothing
but pizza and pancakes.

19:55.844 --> 19:58.938
It's a wonder his eyeballs are still
in their sockets.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.414
Wait a minute.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.281
Oh, man. Not again.

20:41.423 --> 20:43.618
Jake Harper. Unplugged.

21:14.122 --> 21:15.316
