WEBVTT

00:48.600 --> 00:50.480
You have to get up.
Up, now.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.720
Yeah, yeah.
I have to go out.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.640
Why? W-What's --
What's wrong?

00:53.680 --> 00:54.920
I want you to go down
and sit with Jamie.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.600
I don't want him left
on his own.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.680
Yeah, okay.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.520
Father Scriven called
about the eulogy.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.160
Yeah?

01:14.440 --> 01:18.680
And if someone in the family
wants to talk about Jamie...

01:18.720 --> 01:21.920
Um...
I'm happy to do it.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.520
Unless you want to?

01:25.800 --> 01:29.200
What about Michael?

01:29.240 --> 01:32.280
What do you mean?

01:32.320 --> 01:35.360
Maybe he should say
something, too.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.320
I don't think that's something
he'd want to do.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.360
I think it's only fair.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.480
To who --
who, exactly?

01:58.120 --> 02:00.640
To Jamie.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.280
Do you want to humiliate me
in front of everyone?

02:03.320 --> 02:06.080
Is that it?

02:06.120 --> 02:07.280
Of course not.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.040
Then why are you
doing this?

02:10.080 --> 02:13.560
You know I never once tried
to punish you

02:13.600 --> 02:15.400
or make you feel bad
about what happened.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.760
Not once.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.000
If anything, I blamed myself
for ending up in prison

02:22.040 --> 02:23.640
and leaving you all alone,
and now, what?

02:23.680 --> 02:24.960
You --

02:25.000 --> 02:26.280
You make me feel
like the shitty one

02:26.320 --> 02:27.800
'cause you...

02:29.880 --> 02:31.360
fucked my brother?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.520
Jamie's dead.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.040
He's gone.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.800
He doesn't care who says
what at his funeral.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.040
I do.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.120
Michael didn't know
Jamie.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.080
I did.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.560
I'm doing the eulogy, not him,
and that is fucking it.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.200
Don't I have a say
in this?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.520
No!

03:03.560 --> 03:06.360
Why are you doing this?

03:06.400 --> 03:07.640
Why are you making me fight
for something

03:07.680 --> 03:08.720
that should be mine --
that is mine?

03:08.760 --> 03:10.240
Fuckin' why?

04:08.480 --> 04:09.480
How are you?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.920
How are you?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.320
You know where
it's parked?

04:21.080 --> 04:22.400
If you don't use it in
the next week or so,

04:22.440 --> 04:25.960
shift it somewhere else.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.960
You don't want it
attracting attention.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.160
I'll do that.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.600
I'm sorry about what happened
to your boy, Amanda.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.200
That was wrong.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.440
Thanks, Noel.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.440
And I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.000
I won't forget this
now.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.520
Promise.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.400
Take care.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.360
Jimmy, if there's anything
you need me to do today,

05:23.400 --> 05:25.560
just ask.
No.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.400
No.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.840
I've sent someone on Moore,
by the way.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.120
He'll call me when
he gets a sniff.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.640
Who is it?
You don't know him.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.560
He owes me.
This'll settle his debt.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.080
I can't use anyone
Frank knows,

05:58.120 --> 06:00.520
and I'm not exactly
fucking spoilt for choice, am I?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.960
Has he done this before?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.520
I mean...

06:05.560 --> 06:08.480
Seriously, Jimmy?

06:08.520 --> 06:10.000
What's the problem,
Michael?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.320
He's hardly gonna rat us out,
not after helping us.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.120
It's not the "after"
I'm worried about.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.200
By then, everyone will know
it was us anyway.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.120
But if I'm walking in somewhere
on some spotter's say-so,

06:21.160 --> 06:22.680
I need to know
he's reliable.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.480
You don't have to worry
about that, do you, Michael?

06:25.520 --> 06:28.320
I'm doing the shooting.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.400
That's not
what we agreed.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.880
That's exactly
what's gonna happen.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.200
I'm doing it.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.720
For Jamie.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.480
Killing someone's different
than hurting them, Jimmy.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.120
I should be doing this.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.040
Well, then you need
to find someone else,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.840
because I haven't driven
in nearly 10 years.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.120
Do you really want to be
doing this

06:54.160 --> 06:55.400
with someone
who can't drive properly?

06:55.440 --> 06:57.600
You think I can't
fucking do this?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.120
Is that it?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.920
If you want me to do this
with you,

07:01.960 --> 07:04.400
I do the shooting.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.000
Okay?

07:41.320 --> 07:42.600
Where have you been?

07:42.640 --> 07:43.960
We've been looking
for you.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.920
I got held up.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.160
Don't close that yet.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.000
I want to say goodbye to him
properly.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.680
We're already late.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.840
Don't worry, Mam.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.840
They won't start
without us.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.880
Where's your Da?

07:59.920 --> 08:01.120
Down in the den
with Uncle Michael.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.240
Just give me one minute.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.840
Ah, balls.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.960
I thought I told you not
to leave Jamie alone.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.600
Well, you said until
the undertakers came,

08:22.640 --> 08:24.200
which is exactly
what I did.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.040
You should be upstairs
instead of hiding down here.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.520
Yeah, well, your mother
was at me fucking head, so...

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
I got the car
from Noel.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.080
Amanda.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.000
You sure you want
to go through with this?

08:43.720 --> 08:44.960
If you don't want to do
this, Michael...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.600
No.
...just say so.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.200
All I'm saying is you
don't have to decide now.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.320
You can wait.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.800
See how you feel.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.320
I don't want to wait.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.560
- Are you okay, Pet?
- Yeah.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.960
You know she wouldn't let
Fudge or Kem come today?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.080
A lot of people would've liked
to pay their respects.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.600
Look around you.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.320
Jamie deserves better
than this.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.920
He should've had
a proper funeral.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.440
This is --

09:47.480 --> 09:49.160
It's what Amanda wanted.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.120
She's grieving.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
She shouldn't be allowed
to make decisions like this.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.360
She's only gonna end up
regretting them later.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.080
You look so handsome.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.000
Oh, Jesus...

10:30.720 --> 10:32.760
I love you.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.080
You can close it now.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.600
What's he doing here?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.560
He's just come to pay
his respects.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.880
That night was all kinds
of fuzzy.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.600
Anything at all that
you can remember?

12:59.640 --> 13:01.760
I told you --
it was dark.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.640
I didn't see anything.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.080
I didn't see the shooter
or the car or anything.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.600
So, end of.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.840
Oh, yeah.
I heard you and Caolan Moore

13:10.880 --> 13:14.200
had a dust-up
the other night.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.640
That was nothing.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.480
If he's the one
that killed Jamie,

13:18.520 --> 13:20.440
help us get him, Eric.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.440
I'm not
a fucking rat.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.880
From what I hear,
Moore's been laughing at you.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.600
He'd telling people
you can't touch him.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.520
Is that true, Eric?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.760
Come on.
Help us, Eric,

13:31.800 --> 13:34.640
and we'll
put him away for you.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.720
He won't be laughing
at you then.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.360
Don't know anything.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.080
Didn't see anything,
so...

13:45.000 --> 13:48.080
'Cause he -- he's making you
look like a sap.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.400
You know that,
don't you? I mean,

13:49.440 --> 13:51.040
all I'm hearing
is people are saying

13:51.080 --> 13:54.720
Caolan Moore put you back
in your fucking box.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.520
Hmm.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.080
Okay.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.120
All I'll say is...

14:13.320 --> 14:15.280
the two of you
can fuck off.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.960
Father Now I invite
Jamie's father, Jimmy,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.640
to say a few words.

14:40.840 --> 14:47.120
I heard this saying once,
can't remember where exactly,

14:47.160 --> 14:48.720
but it always stuck with me.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.720
I don't know why.
It just did.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.440
"You can only ever be as happy
as your unhappiest child."

15:02.440 --> 15:05.600
And I know -- I know Jamie
wasn't exactly an angel.

15:05.640 --> 15:10.440
I mean, you only -- you only
have to ask his teachers that.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.840
I also know he was happy.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.760
He just was.
It was in his nature.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.760
Like, even --
even when he was a baby...

15:29.400 --> 15:32.200
oh, man, he'd be smiling
all the time.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.160
It was ridiculous.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.640
People would come up to me
and Amanda

15:36.680 --> 15:38.040
when they saw it
and they'd say,

15:38.080 --> 15:40.680
"You only ever get
one of those, so..."

15:40.720 --> 15:42.640
And every time
I'd come home,

15:42.680 --> 15:43.840
I'd always know
Jamie was there

15:43.880 --> 15:46.400
'cause I could hear
laughing and messing

15:46.440 --> 15:48.880
as soon as
I came in the door.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.440
I'm gonna miss that sound.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.760
I'm gonna miss everything
about him,

15:52.800 --> 15:53.840
but at least I know that
when he was here,

15:53.880 --> 15:55.240
he was happy
and he made us happy.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.880
He made me...

16:00.200 --> 16:01.760
He, uh...

16:38.320 --> 16:41.200
Thank you so much
for coming.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.120
Thanks very much.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.880
My deepest sympathies.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.840
Your son is in my thoughts
and prayers.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.920
Thank you.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.760
Thanks for coming,
Eamon.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
I wanted to pay
my respects.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.280
It's the very least
I could do.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.600
Excuse me.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.240
Anna.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.440
Anna.

17:48.480 --> 17:53.360
Um, I'm -- I'm --

17:53.400 --> 17:54.680
I know who you are.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.800
I'm glad you came today.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.680
I know Jamie
would have been, too.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.120
He was telling me
all about you.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.360
He said --
He said how nice you were,

18:07.400 --> 18:08.640
that you were friendly
and -- and --

18:08.680 --> 18:10.040
Look, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.760
Can -- Can you stay a little
longer so we can talk?

18:15.680 --> 18:16.640
Maybe there's a cafe
around here.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.880
We could go somewhere
or...

18:19.920 --> 18:22.360
You're not supposed to be
anywhere near me,

18:22.400 --> 18:24.480
and if I told my grandmother
about this,

18:24.520 --> 18:25.920
you would be in
big trouble.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.280
I know.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.760
But I'm -- I'm hoping
that can change.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.360
I'm -- I'm applying to the
courts to let me see you again.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.800
That's not gonna happen.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.800
They're not gonna allow you
to see me,

18:36.840 --> 18:38.400
not after what you did.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.960
Well, look,
we're here now.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.920
Can we talk now
for a few minutes?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.760
Maybe get to know
each other again?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.720
And talk about what?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.200
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.520
Name it.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.200
Ask me
whatever you want.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.520
No. Sorry.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.080
There is absolutely nothing
I want to talk to you about.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.960
- Okay.
- See you.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.160
Bye.
Thank you.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.320
Deepest sympathies,
Bridget.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.360
I'm glad you came.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.840
I know it's not much
of a send-off,

19:47.880 --> 19:50.600
but it is what
the boy's mother wanted.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.560
Well, if there's anything
I can do,

19:52.600 --> 19:55.080
you only have to ask.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.280
Well, you could give us
Caolan Moore.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.800
You haven't changed,
Birdy.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.680
Good to see you out,
Michael.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.680
Shame about
the circumstances.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.200
Keeping a low profile
these days?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.560
That's the plan.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.000
Well, if you ever feel
like a bit of sun,

20:36.040 --> 20:39.000
I have a few places
sitting empty in Marbella.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.240
Just hop on a flight, you know,
and we'll put you up.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.120
Yeah, maybe.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.720
Whatever you're into,
we can lay it on for you --

20:46.760 --> 20:49.960
gear, girls.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.640
Unless, of course,
you're a faggot like Frank.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.520
But we can sort you out
with that, too.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.720
I'm only messing with you,
Michael.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.680
Live and let live.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.200
That's my motto.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.080
I heard you were there when
Jimmy's young lad was shot.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.760
Yeah.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.520
That was some
fucking cock-up.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.400
That is one way
of putting it.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.280
Oh.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.320
Main thing is it's all
put to bed now.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.360
Hope that's clear, Mike?

21:30.400 --> 21:32.960
Yeah.
Good.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.600
And I'm serious
about the apartment.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.400
Come visit.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.080
I'll give you the five-star
treatment.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.080
Where's Jamie's friends?

21:47.120 --> 21:49.160
I didn't see
any of them here.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.320
They're not here.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.200
Well, why not?

21:54.240 --> 21:56.320
School wouldn't let
them come,

21:56.360 --> 21:59.640
said anyone seen
would be in trouble.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.560
What? Because he'd been
suspended?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.880
No, Mam.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.440
Because he was
a Kinsella.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.240
Ah.

22:18.280 --> 22:19.840
You look well.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.840
Thank you.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.480
Thanks for taking the time
to see me.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.400
Oh, stop it, now.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.000
I only postponed you
once.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.320
This is for
Luke's birthday.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.840
What is it?

22:34.880 --> 22:36.080
If I'd wanted you to know
ahead of him,

22:36.120 --> 22:37.320
I wouldn't have wrapped it,
would I?

22:37.360 --> 22:39.960
It's very thoughtful.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.360
Thank you.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.120
How are the girls?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.840
Good.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.720
You should call them yourself
and ask them.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.360
I take it Marta's well?

22:57.120 --> 22:59.880
If you're going to be cruel,
let's not talk about her.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.640
I'm never cruel.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.120
I'm resentful.
There's a difference.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.760
I resent how quickly she was
able to

23:06.800 --> 23:09.280
work out all the things
I couldn't,

23:09.320 --> 23:14.400
like live in Spain,
away from all your shit here.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.880
What?
Was it really that bad?

23:17.920 --> 23:20.120
You tell me.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.720
You were the one who left,
Eamon.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.320
Could you just give us
a second, please?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.560
We're not quite ready yet.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.080
I'll give you a shout,
John.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.760
Look, Eamon...

23:51.800 --> 23:53.200
I had planned to save this

23:53.240 --> 23:54.720
'till after dessert,
so as to not ruin the meal,

23:54.760 --> 23:58.280
but I'm not sure
I can wait that long.

24:02.440 --> 24:08.080
A few months ago,
I found a lump,

24:08.120 --> 24:10.080
and I've had it checked
and biopsied.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.040
And it's not good.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.160
What do you mean by
"not good"?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.360
What do you think I mean?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.600
Who'd you see?

24:19.640 --> 24:20.880
We'll get
a second opinion.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.080
I don't mean here.
We'll go to the States.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.400
They've got wonderful
facilities --

24:24.440 --> 24:26.560
Eamon, stop.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.400
This is a problem
you can't fix.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.360
Moore's on a session
with his mates.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.520
He's just sitting there.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.000
You sure you want to do this
on the day we buried Jamie?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.040
It's fucking karma.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.240
Amanda?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.600
Moore knows it's
Jamie's funeral,

25:24.640 --> 25:26.120
and he thinks we'll be
distracted by that.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.120
That's why he's out.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.000
When will we get
another chance like this?

25:35.120 --> 25:36.600
Okay.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.320
Go straight home.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.000
We'll see you there.

26:21.320 --> 26:25.120
Hey.
Don't worry.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.600
We'll see you later.
I promise.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.120
Come here.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.440
Love you.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.000
Mind yourselves.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.960
Want a bump?

27:52.600 --> 27:54.200
When you go in that door,

27:54.240 --> 27:56.720
Keith said Moore's halfway down
on your right-hand side.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.280
He's wearing a red puffa jacket,
so it won't be hard to spot.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.880
See this prick?

28:00.920 --> 28:02.680
I got info that he's the one
who shot Jamie,

28:02.720 --> 28:04.760
just in case
he's in there, too.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.160
After you've done it,
keep going straight on.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.600
There's an exit door
at the back.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.680
I know, Jimmy.
You told me.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.080
I know I told you.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.040
Just going over it
so we're clear, is all.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.120
You get to that door,
I'll be waiting for you.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.880
Michael.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.520
Fuck.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.280
Get down!

30:14.400 --> 30:17.600
What the fuck happened?
Are you alright?

30:17.640 --> 30:19.240
The back door
was padlocked.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.000
Did you get him?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.480
Yeah.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.120
Let's go.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.600
Well?

31:38.640 --> 31:40.240
It's done.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.760
Where's Michael now?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.360
Gone home.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.200
But everything
went okay?

31:52.240 --> 31:53.800
Yeah.

31:56.360 --> 32:01.560
It's already up on Twitter
about the shooting.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.760
They haven't named Moore
yet,

32:02.800 --> 32:04.760
but they're saying
the victim is dead.

32:17.120 --> 32:21.720
Alright. Go get a shower
before the guards arrive.

32:21.760 --> 32:25.280
Leave your clothes out
for the wash.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.680
Okay.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.920
I'm gonna take this.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.880
- Alright, Eamon?
- <i>You have no idea</i>

33:08.920 --> 33:11.200
<i>what you have
just fucking started. </i>

33:11.240 --> 33:12.880
You and your idiot son

33:12.920 --> 33:16.800
and your whole
fucking inbred family --

33:16.840 --> 33:19.080
you're all done,
'cause you're fucking dead.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.560
Listen, Eamon, whatever
you might think one of us --

33:20.600 --> 33:22.080
No, you fucking listen!

33:25.120 --> 33:27.920
That funeral suit, Frank --
you better mind that,

33:27.960 --> 33:30.320
'cause it's gonna get
lots of fucking use,

33:30.360 --> 33:32.040
I promise you that.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.560
What the fuck?

34:00.600 --> 34:04.520
It's unlocked.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.320
I'm not armed.
You can come in.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.200
Are you arresting him
or not?

34:15.240 --> 34:17.080
'Cause I want to know
if I need to call a solicitor.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.240
Yeah, you need to
call one.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.520
Mam, what's going on?

34:19.560 --> 34:20.840
Go on over to Birdy's.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.560
You can sleep there
tonight.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.760
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay here with you?

34:24.800 --> 34:26.360
I'll call you
if I need you.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.600
'Night, Da.'Night, son.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.360
You alright?
Yeah, I'm grand.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.080
What's going on
over there?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.720
Dunno. They're searching
our gaff and Michael's.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.600
Did they say
what it was about?

34:43.640 --> 34:45.120
Not to me.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.600
Bed's made up in the spare room.
Now go on up.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.160
Thanks, Birdy.
G'night.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.880
G'night, pet.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.960
That circus outside --

35:54.000 --> 35:56.080
I presume that's about
Caolan Moore getting clipped?

35:56.120 --> 35:57.640
Yeah.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.360
So, somebody please
fucking tell me

35:59.400 --> 36:01.280
that the keystone cops
have it arseways

36:01.320 --> 36:03.560
and that it wasn't Jimmy
or Michael who killed him?

36:03.600 --> 36:07.520
You're gonna have to talk
to them about that.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.040
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

36:09.080 --> 36:10.960
It means you need
to speak to them.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.920
Oh. Fuck.

36:13.960 --> 36:18.440
Have you any fucking idea
what's gonna happen now,

36:18.480 --> 36:21.360
if they did that?

36:21.400 --> 36:24.640
Have you?
Jimmy is fucking dead.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.280
You know that, don't you?
It's only a matter of when.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.720
'Cause Eamon's gonna put
a bounty on his head,

36:28.760 --> 36:30.520
and he'll make it
so fucking big

36:30.560 --> 36:32.080
that any junkie
with a gun

36:32.120 --> 36:34.040
will be out there
trying to claim it.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.440
And Michael, too.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.680
They won't be able to cross
the street

36:36.720 --> 36:37.560
without looking
over their shoulder.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.360
Any time a fucking car
pulls up

36:39.400 --> 36:40.720
or a door opens
behind them,

36:40.760 --> 36:42.280
they'll be thinking,
"Are they here for me?"

36:42.320 --> 36:44.720
And one fucking day,
they fucking will be.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.240
Caolan Moore killed Jamie.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.240
- What did he expect?
- Just shut the fuck up!

36:48.280 --> 36:49.480
You don't have a notion
what you're talking about,

36:49.520 --> 36:50.720
so keep it
fucking buttoned.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.240
Frank.
Anthony's asleep upstairs.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.960
You go and tell your husband
that he and his brother

36:59.000 --> 37:00.600
have fucked this family.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.880
They have fucked us.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.800
And we're all gonna have to pay
for what they did,

37:05.840 --> 37:07.400
every one of us.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.840
Go home, Amanda.
Go home.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.440
We'll talk to you
later.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.280
Well, they won't say
what they have on you,

37:42.320 --> 37:44.600
which means either they're
saving it for the interview --

37:44.640 --> 37:50.520
big fucking reveal -- or maybe
they have nothing at all.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.600
You okay?
You look like shit.

37:52.640 --> 37:56.000
Where's Jimmy?
He's not here.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.040
I think they took him
to Kevin Street Station.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.760
Is there anything I need to know
before the interview?

38:04.840 --> 38:06.800
'Cause if there's a chance
of witnesses or evidence

38:06.840 --> 38:10.120
linking you to the shooting,
I want to know.

38:10.160 --> 38:13.160
There isn't.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.760
What about CCTV?

38:17.720 --> 38:19.520
Um...

38:19.560 --> 38:21.600
the only reason I'm here
is because the lad who was shot

38:21.640 --> 38:24.760
was the one
behind Jamie's death.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.720
That's why they picked up me
and Jimmy.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.200
That's all?

38:30.240 --> 38:31.720
Nothing else?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.560
No. Nothing.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.560
Alright.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.920
Michael?

38:42.120 --> 38:45.160
Michael?

38:45.200 --> 38:48.480
Fuck.
You sure you're okay?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.840
Yeah.
I-I need a drink of water.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.400
Yeah, um...

38:56.440 --> 38:59.320
Guard.
Guard.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.600
We need some medical help
over here now!

39:09.080 --> 39:12.520
Come on!

39:31.880 --> 39:33.440
Alright.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.560
The fuck?

39:36.600 --> 39:38.000
It's not even00.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.200
Frank told us to
meet him here.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.120
Why?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.280
Caolan Moore's
brown bread.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.280
He was clipped, man.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.360
Fuck off.
Who got him?

39:49.400 --> 39:50.920
Michael.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.560
He walked into some pub
on his own,

39:52.600 --> 39:54.760
done him
in front of everybody.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.360
Bang, bang in the head.
No backup or nothing.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.800
How'd you know
it was Michael?

39:58.840 --> 40:00.520
Him and Jimmy were lifted
straight away.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.000
Everyone knows
it was him.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.280
It's all here, V.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.120
"The Gardai are quizzing
two men in relation

40:06.160 --> 40:08.880
to the killing
of drug dealer Caolan Moore.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.600
One of the men in custody
is a well-known

40:10.640 --> 40:12.560
gangland criminal
from the capital.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.640
Dubbed 'The Magician'...

40:14.680 --> 40:16.360
the 36-year-old
convicted killer

40:16.400 --> 40:18.720
was only recently
released from jail."

40:18.760 --> 40:21.160
"The Magician".
He's even got his own nickname.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.520
And you know why they call him
"The Magician", don't you?

40:23.560 --> 40:24.840
'Cause he makes
people disappear.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.440
Sick, man.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.720
Did yous know
about this before?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.760
No one did.
Frank kept it close.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.560
Caught everyone
on the hop.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.800
Oh.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.560
That's the way to get them,
yeah?

40:37.600 --> 40:39.000
Fuck you, Caolan Moore.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.160
Yup.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.840
He's some man.

40:47.120 --> 40:50.960
Hey, uh, I need to speak to
someone about my son, in 312.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.920
I need one of you to, uh,
ring the guards

40:52.960 --> 40:55.240
and tell them you want
an armed officer here

40:55.280 --> 40:58.960
to protect him
and to protect you, too.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.280
'Cause if you don't, there's
every chance someone's gonna

41:00.320 --> 41:02.560
show up here with a gun,
try and kill him.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.560
Yous two go down and wait
by the main entrance.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.400
Keep an eye out
for anyone sketch.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.600
Yeah.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.280
So, is it true?
It was Michael?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.680
Him and Jimmy have gone
and fucked everything up.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.280
They were right
to do it.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.800
Don't be a fucking clown,
Eric.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.040
Jamie was Jimmy's son.

41:37.080 --> 41:40.440
He was only doing what any
proper father would do.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.320
See, that's why
you don't make decisions.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.360
The nurses say the coppers
are sending a car over.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.840
Thank fuck.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.760
Dr.
Would you say these episodes

41:56.800 --> 41:58.560
have been getting
progressively worse?

41:58.600 --> 42:00.080
In general, yeah.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.600
And more frequent?

42:05.640 --> 42:07.120
Yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.640
What I'm gonna do is write
a report of what happened here

42:13.680 --> 42:15.120
and send it to your GP,

42:15.160 --> 42:17.040
who will refer you
to a consulting neurologist.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.560
Why can't you just tell me
what's wrong with me?

42:19.600 --> 42:22.320
It's not that simple.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.800
There are doctors
who specialize in this area.

42:24.840 --> 42:29.280
They'll need to do tests
before a diagnosis can be made.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.960
Please.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.720
Look, this is just
my initial opinion,

42:40.760 --> 42:44.600
and like I said,
you'll have to do tests

42:44.640 --> 42:48.080
but considering the head trauma
and your symptoms,

42:48.120 --> 42:50.680
I'd say it's possible
you may have developed epilepsy.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.600
Can it be cured?

42:58.640 --> 43:00.160
It can be managed.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.440
Try to avoid anything

43:01.480 --> 43:03.520
that makes you
susceptible to seizures.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.160
Like what? I --

43:05.200 --> 43:06.920
It's different for everyone,
but the kinds of things

43:06.960 --> 43:09.520
that are considered to be
triggers are lack of sleep,

43:09.560 --> 43:12.240
excessive alcohol
or drug-taking.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.800
Stress is a big one.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.920
Try to avoid
stressful situations.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.920
Thank you.

43:33.920 --> 43:38.280
Hey, Doc. So, uh,
can he still be interviewed

43:38.320 --> 43:41.000
after having a seizure?

43:41.040 --> 43:43.040
Dr. I'd recommend
it's rescheduled.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.760
Thanks.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.600
Lock the door.

44:04.760 --> 44:07.120
Don't open it to anyone,
you understand?

44:07.160 --> 44:10.160
No one.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.480
Soon as the banks
are open,

44:11.520 --> 44:13.920
you lodge everything
you've got in here.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.040
You need to find somewhere else
to put it in the future.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.200
Okay.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.240
Stay here.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.400
<i>In the latest gangland
shooting, a young father of two </i>

44:22.440 --> 44:25.720
<i>was gunned down
at this Dublin pub last night. </i>

44:25.760 --> 44:27.960
<i>Caolan Moore was celebrating
the recent birth </i>

44:28.000 --> 44:30.600
<i>of his daughter Leah, when the
gunman entered the pub </i>

44:30.640 --> 44:32.840
<i>and shot him five times.</i>

44:32.880 --> 44:34.800
<i>Moore's fiancée,
Shannon Gogarty, </i>

44:34.840 --> 44:36.840
<i>said he was a loving father,</i>

44:36.880 --> 44:39.880
<i>who enjoyed nothing more than
spending time with his kids. </i>

44:42.320 --> 44:43.800
I'm glad he did it,
Mam.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.560
I'm glad he did it
for Jamie.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.600
Frank?

44:56.640 --> 44:57.800
Dotser?

45:16.920 --> 45:18.760
Fudge,
get them boxes there.

45:29.080 --> 45:32.200
Alright.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.480
Here. When you're doing
your collections,

45:40.520 --> 45:41.880
make sure you've got
Kem with you at all times.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.000
Don't go anywhere
on your own.

45:43.040 --> 45:46.000
Okay.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.600
The lads will be asking
what we're doing for stuff

45:47.640 --> 45:48.840
when this lot runs out.

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
Just tell them
Eamon Cunningham's

45:49.920 --> 45:51.520
not our only
supplier, okay?

45:58.120 --> 45:59.280
Okay?

45:59.320 --> 46:00.800
Yeah.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.320
When you're done at the bank,
go over to my place.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.760
I'll call you when I'm there and
tell you what things to pack,

46:07.800 --> 46:10.120
and bring it all over
to Birdy's house.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.800
You moving in
with Birdy?

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
Just do what I ask,
okay?

46:13.880 --> 46:15.920
Okay.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.000
He had two young kids.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.720
Did you know that?

46:20.760 --> 46:22.320
We all leave
someone behind.

46:24.800 --> 46:28.120
And his fiancée --

46:28.160 --> 46:29.720
she looked about 16.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.040
They were his responsibility,
Amanda, not yours.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.160
Moore made
his own choices.

46:34.200 --> 46:38.160
He let them down,
no one else.

46:38.200 --> 46:41.280
Forget about him.

46:41.320 --> 46:44.800
What if I can't?

46:44.840 --> 46:47.240
You just have to,
Amanda.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.920
You're gonna drive yourself
crazy.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.720
What's done is done.

46:56.920 --> 47:00.120
Push it as far away as you can
and leave it there.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.720
Forget it ever happened.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.600
Is that what you did
with Allison?

47:23.400 --> 47:24.880
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

47:24.920 --> 47:27.440
No.

47:27.480 --> 47:28.840
With Allison,
I do the opposite.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.600
Hello?

47:50.640 --> 47:54.760
<i>I hope you're happy,
you fucking bitch. </i>

47:54.800 --> 47:56.680
<i>It's your fault he's dead.</i>

48:01.440 --> 48:04.400
Noel's blood is on your hands.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.240
He's dead because he helped you.

48:08.560 --> 48:13.000
You're the reason
that our girls have no Da.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.600
<i>You're the reason
for all of this. </i>

48:15.640 --> 48:18.960
<i>You're to blame,
you fucking bitch. </i>

48:19.000 --> 48:21.040
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>
