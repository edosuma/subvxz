WEBVTT

00:01.024 --> 00:03.306
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:03.307 --> 00:06.108
We are in the center
of a shitstorm, Charlie.

00:06.109 --> 00:07.710
The cops are watching us.

00:07.711 --> 00:10.192
White Tony... he's our master,
we're his property.

00:10.193 --> 00:13.916
Fucking Fonso wants to kill us,
and we are gonna lose Nick.

00:13.917 --> 00:15.718
We need to go after all of them.

00:15.719 --> 00:17.039
Didn't I show you loyalty?

00:17.040 --> 00:19.762
I woke up today a million dollars poorer.

00:19.763 --> 00:22.164
Now, you're gonna make things
right financially.

00:22.165 --> 00:23.966
These families will be joined.

00:23.967 --> 00:27.410
A marriage between Fonso's eldest, Drina,

00:27.411 --> 00:29.372
and White Tony's son, Little Tony.

00:29.373 --> 00:31.173
This better be about my money, Charlie.

00:31.174 --> 00:33.175
Have you ever been to a gypsy wedding?

00:35.499 --> 00:37.660
The money belongs to White Tony.

00:37.661 --> 00:39.782
With the Roma unity
as my guiding principle,

00:39.783 --> 00:41.544
that is my decree.

00:41.545 --> 00:44.787
We have to abide by the law.
We have no choice.

00:44.788 --> 00:45.949
Okay, Mom.

00:51.114 --> 00:52.835
Do I know you?

00:52.836 --> 00:56.319
If we'd met, you'd remember.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.082
Now, give me your motherfucking watch.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.725
Thank you.

01:05.248 --> 01:06.369
<i>Gadje.</i>

01:13.977 --> 01:15.057
New life!

01:15.058 --> 01:16.739
New life!

01:20.264 --> 01:22.385
The hammer belonged to her grandfather.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.547
It was supposed to be a gift
for the bride.

01:24.548 --> 01:26.749
I... I knew there was bad blood.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.831
I didn't think it would come to this.

01:28.832 --> 01:31.994
Your grandmother did a bad, bad thing.

01:31.995 --> 01:34.036
Ma'am? Hands where I can see them.

01:34.758 --> 01:35.998
Charlie?

01:35.999 --> 01:39.001
Stealing from gypsies, however,

01:39.002 --> 01:41.244
will fuck you inside and out.

01:41.245 --> 01:42.886
Fonso.

01:55.939 --> 01:58.100
Like all great short cons,

01:58.101 --> 02:00.703
three-card monte is deceptively simple...

02:00.704 --> 02:02.545
two black cards, one red card.

02:02.546 --> 02:05.428
I like using the Queen of Hearts
because, well...

02:05.429 --> 02:07.069
Lady Luck.

02:07.070 --> 02:10.354
Your job... follow the Queen.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.197
Where is she?

02:16.800 --> 02:18.721
Very good. See? It's simple.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.883
Two black cards, one red card.

02:20.884 --> 02:22.886
Follow the Queen. Where is she now?

02:26.490 --> 02:27.490
Winner, winner.

02:28.892 --> 02:31.374
Shall we make a little wager this time?

02:31.375 --> 02:32.815
Easy money.

02:32.816 --> 02:34.577
I'm sure you got a few dollar bills

02:34.578 --> 02:35.858
still stuck in your panties.

02:35.859 --> 02:38.341
You ass.

02:38.342 --> 02:40.823
This is not my true calling,
and you know it.

02:40.824 --> 02:42.225
I know. I know.

02:42.226 --> 02:43.746
You're like me...

02:43.747 --> 02:46.650
proud practitioner
of the ancient art of grift.

02:47.311 --> 02:48.902
You ever use a shill?

02:49.753 --> 02:52.915
Only when I want to draw
a crowd or bend a corner.

02:52.916 --> 02:55.951
Well, the longer I sit here,
Charles, the less I make.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.000
Follow the Queen.

02:58.001 --> 03:00.444
'Round and 'round she goes.
Where she stops...

03:01.765 --> 03:03.247
Where is she?

03:10.854 --> 03:12.455
What is your secret, Charlie?

03:12.456 --> 03:14.897
Lifts, cold decking,
dealing from the basement.

03:14.898 --> 03:16.219
It's just standard stuff.

03:16.220 --> 03:18.180
No, I said, "What is your secret?"

03:18.181 --> 03:21.544
You've been coming in here
once, twice a week, all summer.

03:21.545 --> 03:24.627
This is the first time
you don't have a mark in tow,

03:24.628 --> 03:27.830
some sucker you're trying
to sell swampland to.

03:27.831 --> 03:29.632
I'm better than that.

03:29.633 --> 03:32.515
No, you <i>were</i> better than that,
'til you got busted.

03:32.516 --> 03:36.439
Did a short stint, got out,
got married, had a kid.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.721
You tried to play it straight,
but it didn't take.

03:38.722 --> 03:40.763
You're back to running short cons,

03:40.764 --> 03:43.957
not for cash... for joy.

03:44.568 --> 03:47.610
Your marriage is rocky,
but your little girl's fab,

03:47.611 --> 03:49.692
and she misses her daddy
somethin' fierce.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.494
How the fuck did you know...

03:51.495 --> 03:54.817
I will tell you my secret
if you buy me another.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.226
Plenty of cash.

04:03.227 --> 04:04.907
In other words, you don't need to con.

04:04.908 --> 04:06.509
Parole officer's business card,

04:06.510 --> 04:08.591
your wife's Clark County
health insurance card,

04:08.592 --> 04:11.754
and a note...

04:11.755 --> 04:14.613
from a young lady named Vicki.

04:15.919 --> 04:17.721
Yeah, it's my 5-year-old daughter.

04:20.603 --> 04:22.846
How'd you know
my marriage was on the rocks?

04:24.288 --> 04:25.329
Is it?

04:27.731 --> 04:29.412
That's quite a pull.

04:29.413 --> 04:31.294
But it's no magic.

04:31.295 --> 04:32.815
Well, I don't know
if you've heard, Charles,

04:32.816 --> 04:34.977
but folks really can't make magic.

04:34.978 --> 04:36.739
I beg to differ.

04:45.749 --> 04:49.673
You once said you always wanted
to see the Pacific Ocean.

04:51.355 --> 04:53.777
Ever since I was back in Georgia.

04:54.638 --> 04:57.197
Bus fare only got me as far as this dump.

04:58.201 --> 05:01.003
Close your eyes.

05:01.004 --> 05:02.327
Really?

05:03.487 --> 05:04.663
Really.

05:05.689 --> 05:07.165
Okay...

05:07.931 --> 05:10.377
Charles K. Haverford...

05:11.211 --> 05:12.856
if that's even your name.

05:14.436 --> 05:15.998
Here we go.

06:39.423 --> 06:40.824
You did it.

06:43.307 --> 06:45.348
You made magic for me.

06:45.349 --> 06:47.431
I hope it won't be the last time.

06:50.514 --> 06:52.075
Promise me something.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.918
Let's never con each other.

06:57.801 --> 06:59.319
Never.

09:01.445 --> 09:02.565
Hey. Nick.

09:02.566 --> 09:04.447
What the fuck?!

09:04.448 --> 09:05.808
Don't say "fuck"!

09:05.809 --> 09:07.330
Get in the fucking car now.

09:32.396 --> 09:35.478
I don't understand. Where are we going?

09:35.479 --> 09:37.079
- Seattle.
- Portland.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.361
Which one?

09:38.362 --> 09:39.854
- Portland.
- Seattle.

09:40.484 --> 09:42.232
Oh, my God.

09:43.086 --> 09:44.567
When are we coming back?

09:44.568 --> 09:46.861
Never, honey. I told you... we're moving.

09:47.371 --> 09:48.697
What?

09:49.733 --> 09:51.783
Mom, what about my stuff?

09:52.416 --> 09:53.936
What about school?

09:53.937 --> 09:55.698
We'll find you a good school.

09:55.699 --> 09:57.420
I <i>like</i> my school.

09:57.421 --> 09:58.741
Mom, I do.

09:58.742 --> 10:00.263
No, you don't. You hate it there.

10:00.264 --> 10:03.065
What are you talking about?
You don't know me!

10:03.066 --> 10:05.988
This... This is crazy.
This is... This is stupid.

10:05.989 --> 10:07.510
This is so like you two.

10:07.511 --> 10:08.991
You never tell me anything!

10:08.992 --> 10:10.993
Dad, I don't...
I don't really know what you do.

10:10.994 --> 10:12.835
Mom, I don't know who you <i>are.</i>

10:12.836 --> 10:15.037
You... You're always in trouble.

10:15.038 --> 10:16.519
You two, you just...

10:16.520 --> 10:18.282
you fuck everything up!

10:28.091 --> 10:30.093
Fuck's sake!

10:31.695 --> 10:32.936
Charlie!

10:38.222 --> 10:40.543
He's right... we need to turn around,

10:40.544 --> 10:42.585
and we need to go back home.

10:42.586 --> 10:44.186
What...

10:44.544 --> 10:46.949
You said Fonso knows we have his money.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.752
You said that your...
your vision thing told you so.

10:49.753 --> 10:51.754
We need to get back in the car
and get the fuck out of here!

10:52.996 --> 10:54.437
I'm sorry. It's not funny.

10:54.438 --> 10:55.558
He will kill us.

10:55.559 --> 10:57.199
I know. I know.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.441
What is so fucking funny?

10:58.442 --> 10:59.922
The irony of it all.

10:59.923 --> 11:01.163
The irony?

11:01.164 --> 11:03.085
Somewhere, somebody up there...

11:03.086 --> 11:05.328
God, Buddha, Wicked Witch of the West,

11:05.329 --> 11:07.570
or all three... are staring down at me

11:07.571 --> 11:09.612
and laughing their fucking asses off.

11:09.613 --> 11:11.013
Don't you see, honey?

11:11.014 --> 11:14.217
I'm a fraud, a charlatan, a fake.

11:14.218 --> 11:16.138
So what do they give me?

11:16.139 --> 11:17.975
A <i>real</i> vision thing.

11:19.102 --> 11:21.584
I saw bleeding roses.

11:21.585 --> 11:24.587
I saw doughnuts boiling in oil.

11:24.588 --> 11:29.832
I saw gypsy nails
raining down from the sky.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.675
I saw the future, Linda.

11:32.676 --> 11:34.156
And I was afraid.

11:34.157 --> 11:36.439
Well, I'm not afraid anymore.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.931
Honey.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.202
<i>I</i> am.

11:40.203 --> 11:42.885
I am fucking terrified, Charlie.

11:42.886 --> 11:44.487
No, no, no, no, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

11:44.488 --> 11:47.250
All we have to do is stick to the plan.

11:47.251 --> 11:49.652
The... The plan?
I thought <i>this</i> was the plan.

11:49.653 --> 11:51.494
I thought that we were
gonna get the fuck out.

11:51.495 --> 11:54.617
No, the plan <i>we</i> made in Vegas...

11:54.618 --> 11:57.740
to have our own shop in sunny L. A.

11:57.741 --> 12:01.162
Next to swimming pools
and fucking movie stars.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.787
We need to go home
and give Fonso his money

12:04.788 --> 12:06.790
and get him out of our lives.

12:08.392 --> 12:10.633
What about White T, Incorporated?

12:10.634 --> 12:12.315
What about that?
Don't we still work for them?

12:12.316 --> 12:13.996
I have a plan for that, too.

12:13.997 --> 12:15.927
It's gonna take a little while,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.642
but we're gonna get them all out.

12:20.484 --> 12:21.725
Then what?

12:25.209 --> 12:27.651
And then we'll live happily ever after.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.816
Hey!

12:33.697 --> 12:35.258
Are we moving or what?!

12:35.259 --> 12:38.541
Change of plans, buddy. Change of plans.

12:52.796 --> 12:55.758
Come on, man. I got children.

12:55.759 --> 12:58.001
Can't we just fucking go already?

12:59.963 --> 13:01.514
You asshole.

13:02.206 --> 13:04.127
What is taking so long?

13:08.171 --> 13:09.453
Ma?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.617
Ma!

13:37.721 --> 13:39.443
I got your message.

13:43.046 --> 13:44.641
Leaving town?

13:45.088 --> 13:46.643
Thought about it.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.728
But I didn't think you'd like it.

13:49.854 --> 13:51.455
Well, that's good thinking.

13:53.937 --> 13:55.902
I was thinking, too...

13:56.694 --> 13:58.502
about your magic trick.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.985
White Tony fucked me.

14:02.986 --> 14:05.428
The bride and groom
were supposed to disappear

14:05.429 --> 14:07.790
and a wedding cake appear.

14:07.791 --> 14:10.633
Someone swapped a corpse for the cake.

14:18.922 --> 14:21.245
Speak of the devil.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.289
White Tony insulted Ma,

14:26.290 --> 14:31.020
so she bashed a hole in his head
with her favorite hammer.

14:32.256 --> 14:33.536
Sir?

14:33.537 --> 14:35.775
Can you please remain with your family?

14:36.660 --> 14:38.382
Of course, Officer.

14:48.352 --> 14:52.236
Take very good care of my money.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.879
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

15:08.011 --> 15:09.726
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:01.064 --> 18:03.906
May I have this seat?

18:03.907 --> 18:05.388
Fuck off.

18:08.312 --> 18:11.193
Is it necessary... the foul language?

18:11.194 --> 18:14.757
Is that kind of talk
absolutely necessary?

18:14.758 --> 18:16.078
Hmm?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.682
Fuck... off.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.724
Take mine. I'll stand.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.246
Oh, no, no, no.

18:23.247 --> 18:26.449
I'm sure the young lady
will do the right thing.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.891
This young lady's
gonna fuck you up, bitch.

18:28.892 --> 18:30.373
Oh!

18:30.374 --> 18:34.056
Foul language
and threat of physical violence.

18:34.057 --> 18:35.378
Hmm.

18:35.379 --> 18:38.581
The hallmarks of the weak and foolish.

18:38.582 --> 18:42.024
Yo, I mean it. I will hurt you.

18:42.025 --> 18:44.026
- Do you? Do you really mean it?
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.027 --> 18:47.069
Are you so foolish as to add assault

18:47.070 --> 18:48.871
to the myriad of your charges

18:48.872 --> 18:51.474
and ensure that you're going
to be held here without bail?

18:54.077 --> 18:56.118
Oh, so, you... you want <i>this</i> seat.

18:56.119 --> 18:57.400
Yes.

18:57.401 --> 18:58.642
All right.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.497
Mm-hmm.

19:30.274 --> 19:31.994
Damn, bitch.

19:31.995 --> 19:33.557
Thank you.

19:38.242 --> 19:40.563
Mm. Coffee.

19:40.564 --> 19:42.245
Coffee is brewing.

19:42.246 --> 19:43.766
I've made eggs.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.008
I don't need eggs. I need matches.

19:46.009 --> 19:47.169
Uh, junk drawer.

19:47.170 --> 19:48.731
Ah.

19:50.093 --> 19:51.374
Smoking again?

19:51.375 --> 19:53.856
I need it again.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.017
Thanks.

19:55.018 --> 19:56.619
Nick! Time for school!

19:56.620 --> 19:59.849
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so loud!

20:00.544 --> 20:02.585
Sylvia, what are you doing here?

20:02.586 --> 20:04.827
Looking for a Bloody Mary.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.830
No, I mean, what are you
still doing here?

20:07.831 --> 20:10.873
Shouldn't you be on some sort of
cruise ship by now or something?

20:10.874 --> 20:12.555
Oh, shit. You actually believed me?

20:13.677 --> 20:15.918
I needed a place to crash,

20:15.919 --> 20:18.241
and I know your door's always open.

20:18.242 --> 20:19.682
I wuv you, big brother.

20:19.683 --> 20:21.964
Nick! Get up for school, please!

20:21.965 --> 20:24.607
And what the fuck was
all that noise about last night?

20:24.608 --> 20:26.249
Long story.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.251
Nick! Did you hear me?

20:28.252 --> 20:29.452
Yeah. What?

20:29.453 --> 20:31.414
Get ready for school, please.

20:31.415 --> 20:33.776
Yeah, I'm ready, Dad.

20:33.777 --> 20:34.938
Oh.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.751
Hon, Nick's ready to go to school.

20:48.752 --> 20:51.394
Uh, I'd take him, but...

20:51.395 --> 20:53.397
I got a regular this morning.

20:54.718 --> 20:56.359
You never told me where.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.990
Where what?

20:58.682 --> 21:00.724
Where you hid our bundles of joy.

21:09.973 --> 21:11.879
It was a bitch to jack up.

21:13.047 --> 21:16.300
And for the record,
they're <i>Fonso's</i> bundles of joy.

21:21.225 --> 21:23.026
I know, I know.

21:25.349 --> 21:26.669
Hey, Linda.

21:26.670 --> 21:29.191
Hi, Marty. How are you?

21:29.192 --> 21:30.753
Ugh... I can't.

21:30.754 --> 21:31.954
Oh, it's open.

21:31.955 --> 21:33.237
Thanks.

21:43.006 --> 21:44.887
Good morning.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.250
Good morning.

21:51.375 --> 21:52.378
What?

21:53.421 --> 21:55.258
That's what <i>I'm</i> wondering.

21:55.259 --> 21:56.882
What's going on in there?

21:57.821 --> 21:59.176
Can we just go?

22:00.103 --> 22:01.265
No.

22:02.866 --> 22:06.829
Honey, I want to talk to you
about last night.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.431
I'm gonna be late.

22:08.432 --> 22:10.393
Well, I'll write you a note.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.595
You must be pretty pissed off.

22:12.596 --> 22:14.036
You think?

22:14.037 --> 22:16.527
Well, I don't blame you. I would be, too.

22:17.281 --> 22:19.363
I know how upsetting it is to move,

22:19.923 --> 22:21.991
especially in the middle
of the school year.

22:22.326 --> 22:25.568
I mean, Christ, my mom moved me
seven times in eight years.

22:25.569 --> 22:27.410
But your dad and I talked about it,

22:27.411 --> 22:29.206
and we're not going anywhere.

22:29.853 --> 22:31.054
Great.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.086
We done?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.300
I guess we are.

23:05.529 --> 23:07.690
The Hanged Man?! What?!

23:07.691 --> 23:09.692
I die of autoerotic asphyxiation?

23:09.693 --> 23:11.574
No, Marty, I told you.

23:11.575 --> 23:13.696
The images of the tarot are not literal.

23:13.697 --> 23:16.699
The Hanged Man tells me
that you're at a crossroads.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.672
Ugh. What a week I've had.

23:19.507 --> 23:20.863
Tell me about it.

23:20.864 --> 23:23.185
Well, first,
the scuttlebutt at the studio

23:23.186 --> 23:25.588
is that my baby,
the project I'm developing,

23:25.589 --> 23:27.310
is in the proverbial shitter.

23:27.311 --> 23:29.432
Then the other night,
my on-again/off-again boyfriend

23:29.433 --> 23:32.194
text-dumps me from our favorite bar-cade.

23:32.195 --> 23:34.557
Oh, and then Cap'n Fluffs had a seizure!

23:34.558 --> 23:35.942
Your dog?

23:35.943 --> 23:37.159
- My cat.
- Your cat.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.362
And now he's on meds that cost $30 a pop.

23:39.363 --> 23:42.725
And the final insult, Charlie,
is that all this stress

23:42.726 --> 23:44.647
has made me go
temporarily blind in one eye.

23:44.648 --> 23:46.889
Where are you? Can't see you.
Oh, I don't know.

23:46.890 --> 23:47.970
There you are!

23:47.971 --> 23:49.852
That is a lot of crossroads.

23:49.853 --> 23:51.654
You know that the Hanged Man

23:51.655 --> 23:55.258
can also indicate
that you are neglecting...

23:55.259 --> 23:56.979
your spiritual self.

23:56.980 --> 23:58.661
Whoa. What's up with that?

23:58.662 --> 24:01.544
It means different things
to different people.

24:01.545 --> 24:03.666
It's... It's part of all of our lives.

24:03.667 --> 24:06.550
There's something
that you need to, um, focus on.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.832
I'm not gonna even ask what that one is.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.274
The Five of Swords.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.477
It can be both a beacon of hope...

24:14.895 --> 24:16.239
and a dire warning.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.880
Oh, God.

24:17.881 --> 24:20.724
When reversed,
it speaks to recent losses.

24:22.646 --> 24:25.167
Losses that have hit you very hard.

24:25.168 --> 24:26.369
No shit, Sherlock.

24:26.370 --> 24:27.651
There's more.

24:29.533 --> 24:34.456
Though... you are in a state
of unhappiness due to others,

24:35.249 --> 24:38.060
only <i>you</i> can pull yourself out.

24:58.642 --> 25:00.604
What if I fail?

25:02.846 --> 25:04.848
I mean, what if I can't pull myself out?

25:09.533 --> 25:11.094
Uh, you have to.

25:12.936 --> 25:14.204
You have to.

25:15.819 --> 25:17.180
Let's keep going.

25:28.031 --> 25:30.033
Marks, Rita W.

25:33.557 --> 25:34.837
Hold on.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.162
Has this cell been serviced
in the last 24 hours?

25:40.163 --> 25:43.246
This is absolutely unacceptable.

25:43.247 --> 25:46.369
Mrs. Marks, I'm so sorry.

25:46.370 --> 25:49.212
Get her cleaned up,
return her personal effects,

25:49.213 --> 25:51.335
and bring her to me
as quickly as possible.

25:57.821 --> 25:59.742
Take care, Sharon.

25:59.743 --> 26:02.385
I do hope your mother's chemo goes well.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.827
Thanks, Rita.

26:06.910 --> 26:08.712
Right this way, ma'am.

26:51.074 --> 26:53.436
Ah.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.679
Sit, please.

27:03.767 --> 27:05.649
Have a muffin.

27:07.411 --> 27:09.893
These here are gluten-free.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.575
I made them myself,
so I know they're good.

27:15.379 --> 27:19.061
It seems you're not
a court-appointed attorney.

27:19.062 --> 27:21.744
You don't appear to be a policeman,

27:21.745 --> 27:23.500
so you are a baker.

27:26.029 --> 27:27.750
Not if you ask my son.

27:27.751 --> 27:33.035
I- I-I think his exact words
were, "This sucks, Dad."

27:33.343 --> 27:35.438
Teenagers, right?

27:35.439 --> 27:38.474
Please... try one. You must be starved.

27:38.922 --> 27:40.643
I know all about starving.

27:40.644 --> 27:42.245
Mm. That's right.

27:42.246 --> 27:45.048
You grew up in the slums of Belgrade.

27:48.412 --> 27:49.692
Birth name... unknown.

27:49.693 --> 27:52.154
Birth date... unknown.

27:52.616 --> 27:55.741
Is it polite to ask a woman her age?

27:56.900 --> 28:00.943
Married in what is now Serbia in 1967...

28:00.944 --> 28:03.145
an arranged marriage to your cousin,

28:03.146 --> 28:04.907
one Tibor Marks.

28:04.908 --> 28:07.189
You make it sound so romantic.

28:08.912 --> 28:14.477
Uh, you and your husband
immigrated to the U. S. in 1972

28:14.478 --> 28:17.960
on what were most likely forged papers.

28:17.961 --> 28:20.363
Uh, ended up in Phoenix,

28:20.364 --> 28:23.806
joining a Romani crime family
there, led by one...

28:23.807 --> 28:26.769
Joe-sip "Big Jim" Turner.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.291
"Yo-sip."

28:28.292 --> 28:30.733
"Yo-sip." That is how you pronounce it.

28:30.734 --> 28:32.174
Sorry.

28:32.175 --> 28:33.736
"Yo-sip."

28:33.737 --> 28:37.940
Uh, your son, Alfonso, was born in 1976,

28:37.941 --> 28:40.943
the same year that you and Tibor

28:40.944 --> 28:43.266
relocated to the greater Los Angeles area

28:43.267 --> 28:47.109
to start your <i>own</i> crime family.

28:47.110 --> 28:49.111
The Marks family and its associates

28:49.112 --> 28:52.074
currently run a series of
fortune-telling establishments,

28:52.075 --> 28:54.317
as well as being implicated

28:54.318 --> 28:58.160
in various home-repair
and distraction thefts,

28:58.161 --> 29:00.483
insurance fraud, burglaries...

29:00.484 --> 29:03.286
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

29:03.287 --> 29:07.170
Little of that is my concern,
nor my jurisdiction.

29:08.732 --> 29:10.493
But...

29:10.494 --> 29:12.935
an LAPD Psychic Fraud Task Force

29:12.936 --> 29:18.341
recently uncovered evidence
of interstate wire fraud.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.704
<i>That</i> is my concern.

29:22.578 --> 29:24.079
Oh.

29:24.548 --> 29:26.990
You don't work over there at all.

29:28.472 --> 29:30.314
You work over <i>there.</i>

29:32.676 --> 29:34.317
Foster Hilburn,

29:34.318 --> 29:36.880
Assistant U. S. Attorney,
Central District of California.

29:39.563 --> 29:42.605
As you probably surmised,

29:42.606 --> 29:45.007
we've been building quite a RICO case.

29:45.008 --> 29:47.769
Three states, six crime families...

29:48.252 --> 29:50.613
the Turners, Rankos, Millers... others.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.615
Pending charges include
racketeering, money laundering,

29:52.616 --> 29:54.096
wire fraud, identity theft...

29:54.097 --> 29:59.463
You want me to betray my own people?

30:02.506 --> 30:04.453
Seems pretty obvious.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.271
They betrayed you <i>first.</i>

30:12.556 --> 30:14.918
I think I'll try one of your muffins.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.964
Top of the line
is our Monarch Collection.

30:21.965 --> 30:25.047
Steel construction, Pearl Crepe interior.

30:25.048 --> 30:26.929
Available in a variety of colors,

30:26.930 --> 30:31.013
including Going Home Blue,
Sacred Heart Red,

30:31.014 --> 30:33.337
and Lakers Purple and Gold.

30:34.378 --> 30:35.567
That one.

30:36.220 --> 30:39.141
Um... that's our Lady Guadalupe model.

30:39.142 --> 30:40.463
Mm-hmm.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.505
White finish with gold highlights,

30:42.506 --> 30:44.548
meant for... ladies.

30:47.190 --> 30:52.154
Um... we have some more, uh,
masculine color schemes.

30:52.155 --> 30:55.598
Was the deceased
an avid hunter or golfer?

30:55.599 --> 30:58.081
Did White Tony have a favorite color?

30:59.508 --> 31:00.634
White.

31:01.245 --> 31:04.006
Ah. Indeed.

31:04.007 --> 31:07.890
Then... let me recommend
the Lady Guadalupe.

31:07.891 --> 31:09.932
Why be gender-specific in...

31:09.933 --> 31:11.854
- Oh. Hey, hey! Hey!
- ...these... modern... times.

31:11.855 --> 31:14.457
Don't you dare eat on the sofa!

31:14.458 --> 31:15.818
Give me that.

31:15.819 --> 31:16.899
Let it go.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.781
Stop! Wash your hands.

31:18.782 --> 31:21.944
Do <i>not</i> touch this.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.145
My God.

31:32.916 --> 31:34.437
Simza, dear.

31:34.438 --> 31:37.800
I don't suppose you have
the password for the Wi-Fi.

31:37.801 --> 31:40.963
You kidding me? Tony never told me shit.

31:40.964 --> 31:43.005
It's "WhiteTonysWifi."

31:43.006 --> 31:44.247
Really?

31:44.248 --> 31:45.679
Thank you.

31:46.450 --> 31:47.931
Mrs. Ranko.

31:48.372 --> 31:49.852
Yes, what is it, Sophie?

31:49.853 --> 31:51.814
A gadje at the back door.

31:51.815 --> 31:54.057
Wants to pay his respects.

32:08.832 --> 32:10.829
You got balls coming here.

32:11.715 --> 32:14.076
I'm here to give my condolences.

32:14.077 --> 32:17.481
<i>You're</i> gonna need condolences
after your stupid magic trick.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.923
The families were to be united.

32:20.924 --> 32:23.286
You opened an old wound
and tore us all apart.

32:23.287 --> 32:25.087
Simza, it wasn't me.

32:25.088 --> 32:27.049
Your husband... rest his soul...
orchestrated that.

32:27.050 --> 32:28.491
<i>He</i> wanted to hurt Fonso.

32:28.492 --> 32:30.653
And who gave him that idea, huh?

32:30.654 --> 32:31.934
You.

32:31.935 --> 32:34.186
You give me way too much credit.

32:34.618 --> 32:35.979
Do I?

32:38.542 --> 32:41.693
So, who do you think
really killed my Tony?

32:42.706 --> 32:44.026
Rita?

32:44.027 --> 32:46.029
I don't know. I'm not sure.

32:48.472 --> 32:49.673
Fonso?

32:51.275 --> 32:52.995
If he did,

32:52.996 --> 32:55.279
there's not enough evidence
to arrest him.

33:01.725 --> 33:03.126
Thank you for these.

33:05.369 --> 33:07.330
You're a nice gadje.

33:07.331 --> 33:08.931
Respectful.

33:08.932 --> 33:10.373
You're the boss.

33:10.374 --> 33:12.335
I was the boss's wife.

33:12.336 --> 33:14.417
Now I'm the boss's mother.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.730
Tradition, right?

33:19.503 --> 33:20.703
- Jun-Bi!
- Jun-Bi!

33:20.704 --> 33:22.665
Good. Now bounce.

33:22.666 --> 33:24.627
And punch.

33:24.628 --> 33:25.788
And punch.

33:25.789 --> 33:26.989
"Jun-Bi" with a punch. Ready?

33:26.990 --> 33:28.150
- Jun-Bi!
- Jun-Bi! - Jun-Bi!

33:28.151 --> 33:29.592
Good!

33:29.593 --> 33:31.634
LaLa.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.277
LaLa.

33:34.278 --> 33:35.759
Kick some ass.

33:37.761 --> 33:38.761
Yeah.

33:38.762 --> 33:40.122
Side kick!

33:40.123 --> 33:41.604
Good.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.366
Back kick! Good.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.288
Spin! Good! Good.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.169
Yes. Make some noise.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.170
Huzzah!

33:48.171 --> 33:49.692
- Huzzah!
- Good. One more.

33:49.693 --> 33:50.693
Yeah?

33:50.694 --> 33:51.814
Fonso, it's me.

33:51.815 --> 33:53.376
I got a message for you.

33:53.377 --> 33:54.577
Really?

33:54.578 --> 33:55.858
From Simza.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.227
What?

33:58.061 --> 33:59.342
You saw her?

33:59.343 --> 34:01.063
Well, I work for her, remember?

34:01.064 --> 34:02.785
I'm at her house.

34:02.786 --> 34:03.942
Oh.

34:05.148 --> 34:07.670
And she asked about me?

34:07.671 --> 34:09.406
Yeah. She's worried about you.

34:10.393 --> 34:12.034
And there's more.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.677
The Council... it's calling
for a kris about you.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.038
They're holding <i>you</i> responsible

34:16.039 --> 34:18.322
for the bad blood between the families.

34:20.083 --> 34:22.645
You... you're coming, too.

34:22.646 --> 34:24.766
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

34:24.768 --> 34:27.290
Just tell them what you told me.

34:27.291 --> 34:28.757
White...

34:29.493 --> 34:32.495
White Tony. It was all his doing.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.897
Fonso, I cannot take your side on this.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.266
You know that.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.262
You be there.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.513
Dad, we're so late!

34:50.514 --> 34:53.116
It's okay, Mateo.
Just join in. Just join in.

35:21.385 --> 35:23.506
You.

35:23.507 --> 35:25.027
Yeah.

35:34.278 --> 35:36.879
Thought you looked familiar.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.841
I thought that, too.

35:45.889 --> 35:47.730
Which one's yours?

35:54.938 --> 35:58.141
Front row... on the end.

35:59.423 --> 36:00.703
Yeah.

36:00.704 --> 36:01.944
Side kick!

36:01.945 --> 36:03.706
- Yellow belt?
- Upper cut?

36:03.707 --> 36:05.428
She's good.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.910
Hook! And jab!

36:07.911 --> 36:10.073
Been coming here about a year.

36:13.076 --> 36:14.238
Yours?

36:18.682 --> 36:20.003
White belt.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.368
He's getting there.

36:28.932 --> 36:30.974
And the bride last night?

36:32.616 --> 36:34.817
She yours, too?

36:34.818 --> 36:36.260
My oldest.

36:37.901 --> 36:39.543
Congratulations.

36:41.545 --> 36:43.267
Thanks.

36:47.391 --> 36:49.832
We should talk.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.315
After this.

36:52.956 --> 36:54.797
Bring my Rolex.

36:59.963 --> 37:00.964
Dinner!

37:07.451 --> 37:09.212
You're not eating with us?

37:09.213 --> 37:10.613
I told you... I'm going out.

37:10.614 --> 37:12.655
That's tonight?

37:12.656 --> 37:14.378
Then I'm going with you.

37:15.899 --> 37:18.541
Tonight, we have
pork Parmesan with linguine,

37:18.542 --> 37:20.863
grilled asparagus, and arugula salad.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.545
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

37:22.546 --> 37:24.186
Where's the vegan option?

37:24.597 --> 37:26.028
Vegan option?

37:27.030 --> 37:29.552
I'm kidding! God!

37:29.553 --> 37:31.775
Don't mess with the chef.

37:32.734 --> 37:34.076
I need to do this alone.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.158
Don't worry. Stay here.

37:36.159 --> 37:37.721
I got to go change.

38:23.207 --> 38:25.488
You really didn't think I'd
just do as I'm told, did you?

38:25.489 --> 38:26.849
Actually, no.

38:40.384 --> 38:43.426
You know what?
I don't need you fuckers anyway!

38:43.427 --> 38:46.309
You always needed me
more than I needed <i>you!</i>

38:46.310 --> 38:48.226
That doesn't sound good.

38:48.832 --> 38:51.073
I'm... I'm embarrassing myself?

38:51.074 --> 38:53.115
<i>You're</i> a fucking embarrassment!

38:54.958 --> 38:57.000
You saw something, didn't you?

38:59.122 --> 39:00.822
Your vision thing.

39:01.565 --> 39:03.032
Maybe.

39:04.087 --> 39:06.048
Fuck you.

39:06.049 --> 39:07.290
Fuck all of you!

39:30.810 --> 39:32.436
They banished me.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.761
Said I'm unclean.

39:43.687 --> 39:45.849
Like a stinkin' gadje.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.460
They won't let me see my kids...

39:58.422 --> 40:00.131
...ever again.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.144
That's crazy.

40:02.145 --> 40:03.968
This is tradition.

40:04.677 --> 40:07.830
One must accept the ruling of the kris.

40:07.831 --> 40:09.891
There is no other option.

40:11.114 --> 40:12.154
Ma.

40:12.155 --> 40:14.997
Yes, Fonso. I'm out.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.160
With little help from you, I must add.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.843
I'm <i>marime.</i>

40:20.844 --> 40:22.487
I expected this.

40:23.086 --> 40:25.808
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

40:26.115 --> 40:28.931
But don't worry, Fonso...
at least about Drina.

40:28.932 --> 40:31.174
I'll protect the grandchildren.

40:32.175 --> 40:33.617
Stay here.

40:42.826 --> 40:44.627
What the fuck?

40:44.628 --> 40:48.096
I am sorry to interrupt. I won't be long.

40:48.832 --> 40:50.833
I want to tell a story.

40:50.834 --> 40:53.476
Rita. Maybe this isn't the time.

40:53.477 --> 40:55.478
Oh, no, it is the <i>perfect</i> time.

40:55.479 --> 40:58.681
We are all here, representatives
of the West Coast families,

40:58.682 --> 41:03.194
and it is a family story
that I want to tell.

41:03.887 --> 41:06.289
It is about the old country... Serbia.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.610
Tito was in power,

41:07.611 --> 41:10.453
the government was totally corrupt,

41:10.454 --> 41:12.775
Roma oppressed,

41:12.776 --> 41:16.539
and a local official accused my husband

41:16.540 --> 41:19.021
of a crime he didn't commit...

41:19.022 --> 41:21.224
stealing food.

41:21.225 --> 41:24.427
Stealing food was a capital crime

41:24.428 --> 41:26.801
during those hungry years.

41:27.391 --> 41:30.192
False accusations like that
happened all the time,

41:30.193 --> 41:32.795
and, of course, I understood
that it was the official

41:32.796 --> 41:35.518
who stole the food...
not my husband, Tibor.

41:35.519 --> 41:38.120
Anyway, he was arrested...

41:38.121 --> 41:39.482
beaten...

41:39.483 --> 41:40.815
tortured...

41:42.191 --> 41:44.086
thrown into a cell...

41:44.087 --> 41:45.862
left there for dead.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.971
I was... frantic.

41:48.972 --> 41:51.013
I cried all night.
I didn't know what to do.

41:51.014 --> 41:52.815
I knew that I had to save him.

41:52.816 --> 41:55.699
I knew that I had to save my family.

41:57.661 --> 41:59.709
So I went to the official.

42:01.465 --> 42:03.666
I went down on my knees and begged.

42:03.667 --> 42:07.671
I said, "Please,
please spare my husband."

42:10.234 --> 42:15.438
I even gave my body... to him...

42:15.439 --> 42:17.921
for the sake of my family.

42:20.521 --> 42:24.247
But once the official signed the order

42:24.248 --> 42:27.570
rescinding Tibor's conviction,

42:27.571 --> 42:30.740
I took my father's hammer

42:31.335 --> 42:35.938
and opened an ugly hole
into the official's skull,

42:35.939 --> 42:38.501
and then I took
my husband's carving knife

42:38.502 --> 42:40.543
and cut his organ

42:40.544 --> 42:43.586
and fed it to the stray dogs of Belgrade.

42:49.473 --> 42:51.635
I did not kill your husband.

42:54.157 --> 42:56.320
But I'm capable of it.

43:00.764 --> 43:06.067
The Marks family accepts
the ruling of the kris.

43:06.890 --> 43:10.132
My son, Fonso, is banished.

43:10.133 --> 43:13.256
And Simza's son, Little Tony,

43:13.257 --> 43:16.340
and my granddaughter are married.

43:18.141 --> 43:21.183
But I want to help this poor Simza

43:21.887 --> 43:24.168
during these trying times.

43:24.708 --> 43:27.109
I will move in into this new home

43:27.110 --> 43:28.791
with my granddaughter...
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

43:28.792 --> 43:30.393
- ...to steward her...
- Thank you very much.

43:30.394 --> 43:32.074
- ...to teach her how to be...
- No, no, no, no, no.

43:32.075 --> 43:33.676
- ...a good Roma wife.
- No.

43:33.677 --> 43:35.096
Thank you, Rita.

43:36.514 --> 43:38.891
This is a noble sacrifice.

43:39.683 --> 43:40.884
Josip.

43:42.366 --> 43:44.367
Let this proceeding come to an end.

44:04.788 --> 44:06.108
You okay?

44:06.502 --> 44:07.874
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.312
I just... I thought I heard something.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.754
Go back to sleep.

44:15.999 --> 44:17.961
Linda, you know we can't.

44:20.924 --> 44:23.102
Not even just 100 grand?

44:23.687 --> 44:25.689
Not even 100 grand.

44:29.413 --> 44:32.278
Was what happened tonight
at the kris, was that...

44:33.217 --> 44:34.857
was that what you saw?

44:34.858 --> 44:36.699
I thought it might be.

44:36.700 --> 44:37.992
But it wasn't.

44:38.782 --> 44:40.743
So it might still come true?

44:42.426 --> 44:44.123
I really don't know.

44:59.723 --> 45:01.265
Who is it?

45:08.372 --> 45:09.852
Ugh.

45:09.853 --> 45:11.400
Fonso.

45:11.775 --> 45:13.486
Don't.

45:14.017 --> 45:16.019
He already knows we're here.

45:17.877 --> 45:18.862
Yeah?

45:21.265 --> 45:23.371
Get out your cards.

45:24.789 --> 45:26.350
I want a reading.

45:29.152 --> 45:31.796
I thought you didn't believe
in this sort of thing.

45:32.516 --> 45:33.923
I don't.

45:34.478 --> 45:36.359
But you're the real deal.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.081
And I need to know.

45:39.082 --> 45:41.083
The tarot can't predict the future,

45:41.084 --> 45:43.005
but it can help you choose a path...

45:43.006 --> 45:46.088
point you to signposts along the way.

45:59.343 --> 46:01.424
Turn over the fucking cards.

46:06.470 --> 46:08.272
The Tower, reversed.

46:10.834 --> 46:12.835
Tell me what you see.

46:13.170 --> 46:14.917
More danger ahead...

46:14.918 --> 46:16.679
loss, destruction...

46:16.680 --> 46:18.682
life collapsing around you.

46:20.083 --> 46:21.725
Next card.

46:24.528 --> 46:26.350
The Magician...

46:27.491 --> 46:29.270
reversed.

46:30.133 --> 46:32.174
Someone is trying
to take advantage of you,

46:32.175 --> 46:34.497
- manipulate the situation.
- Manipulate the situation.

46:34.498 --> 46:36.098
Let's go.

46:43.868 --> 46:45.620
This is the Judgment card.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.711
Like most tarot, the image is symbolic,

46:49.165 --> 46:50.393
its meaning dependent

46:50.394 --> 46:52.960
- on the next and final card.
- The next and final card.

46:54.117 --> 46:55.798
Get to it.

47:07.811 --> 47:09.972
Tell me what you see.

47:18.262 --> 47:21.464
Tell me... what you see.

47:32.556 --> 47:34.877
You can't piece things together.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.563
You can't control the things around you.

47:41.605 --> 47:45.928
You are... capable of spiteful action.

47:45.929 --> 47:47.770
You're quick to rage.

47:47.771 --> 47:50.052
And you're not to be trusted.

47:50.053 --> 47:53.777
You fight against tradition,
and yet you refuse to change.

48:14.037 --> 48:16.920
You're telling me...

48:21.757 --> 48:23.847
It's what the <i>cards</i> say.

48:33.096 --> 48:35.538
This is bullshit.

48:36.940 --> 48:39.462
Where's my fucking money?

49:00.163 --> 49:02.965
$1.7 million in sequential bills,

49:02.966 --> 49:06.168
so you'll have to launder them
before you can use them.

49:20.704 --> 49:22.465
Until then...

49:26.149 --> 49:27.750
...you got company.
