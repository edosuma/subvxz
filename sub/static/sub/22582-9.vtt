00:12.426 --> 00:16.260
Science Officer's log, August 14, 2152.

00:17.266 --> 00:20.178
Enterprise remains on course
for the trinary system.

00:20.306 --> 00:21.944
I've transmitted a distress call...

00:22.066 --> 00:25.263
but the nearest Vulcan ship
is more than nine days away.

00:25.546 --> 00:29.175
By the time they arrive,
they may only find debris, if that.

00:30.026 --> 00:33.860
Even if Enterprise makes it past the
black hole without being destroyed...

00:33.986 --> 00:36.500
it seems likely the crew won't survive.

00:41.306 --> 00:43.866
It's been a long road

00:46.506 --> 00:48.462
Gettin' from there to here

00:48.586 --> 00:51.384
It's been a long time

00:52.066 --> 00:55.536
But my time is finally near

00:56.146 --> 00:59.536
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:00.306 --> 01:03.139
I will touch the sky

01:03.506 --> 01:07.135
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:07.266 --> 01:10.383
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:10.506 --> 01:14.784
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:14.946 --> 01:17.904
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:18.026 --> 01:22.224
I've got faith to believe

01:22.346 --> 01:25.258
I can do anything

01:25.386 --> 01:29.095
I've got strength of the soul

01:29.826 --> 01:32.738
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:32.866 --> 01:37.018
I can reach any star

01:38.266 --> 01:40.257
I've got faith

01:42.066 --> 01:45.183
I've got faith

01:45.866 --> 01:49.142
Faith of the heart

02:02.226 --> 02:06.299
I'm continuing my analysis
of the condition that's stricken the crew.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.256
Without Dr Phlox's assistance...

02:09.746 --> 02:12.101
I'm not hopeful
about reversing its effects.

02:14.346 --> 02:15.984
I'm documenting my findings...

02:16.106 --> 02:19.860
so that Starfleet will at least
have a record of what happened.

02:21.226 --> 02:25.219
The symptoms began not long after
we set a course for the trinary system.

02:27.066 --> 02:28.977
That was nearly two days ago.

02:31.106 --> 02:33.939
- You're sure it's a black hole?
- A Class Four.

02:35.146 --> 02:36.738
According to the Vulcan starcharts...

02:36.866 --> 02:39.983
your people have surveyed
more than 2,000 of these things.

02:40.106 --> 02:44.622
That's correct, but none of them
were part of a trinary star system.

02:46.346 --> 02:47.904
How close can we get?

02:48.026 --> 02:50.586
The gravitational shear
between the stars is extreme.

02:50.706 --> 02:52.025
We'd have to drop to impulse.

02:52.146 --> 02:55.422
But we should be able to approach
to within 5 million km.

02:56.506 --> 02:58.940
Close enough
to get some nice pictures.

02:59.986 --> 03:02.625
How long would it take
to reach the system at impulse?

03:02.746 --> 03:04.145
Two days.

03:04.826 --> 03:06.225
Set a course.

03:07.786 --> 03:08.901
Trip...

03:11.786 --> 03:15.186
if you've got some free time,
I'd love it if you'd look at my chair.

03:15.186 --> 03:15.584
If you've got some free time,
I'd love it if you'd look at my chair.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.380
- Sir?
- The Captain's chair.

03:20.506 --> 03:21.985
What about it?

03:22.626 --> 03:26.016
You may have noticed that
I don't sit in it very much.

03:26.906 --> 03:30.421
- Is there a problem?
- It's uncomfortable.

03:31.466 --> 03:34.742
When I lean back,
I feel like I'm about to slide out of it.

03:35.746 --> 03:39.102
I have to sort of perch on the edge.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.503
I always assumed
it was the best seat in the house.

03:43.626 --> 03:44.900
Take a look at it for me?

03:45.026 --> 03:47.221
I was going to purge
the impulse manifolds.

03:47.346 --> 03:49.780
The chair first, if you don't mind.

03:51.066 --> 03:52.658
Aye, aye, sir.

03:56.746 --> 03:57.974
Come in.

03:59.026 --> 04:00.823
- Good morning.
- Morning.

04:01.306 --> 04:05.299
- Am I interrupting?
- No, just thinking about something.

04:05.706 --> 04:08.584
- Today's duty roster.
- Thanks.

04:08.706 --> 04:12.221
Lieutenant Reed has a new security
protocol he'd like to discuss with you.

04:12.346 --> 04:15.338
I'll drop by the Armoury. Anything else?

04:16.065 --> 04:19.297
Chef didn't report for duty
this morning. He's ill.

04:19.586 --> 04:22.384
- Is it serious?
- Dr Phlox said it's a simple virus.

04:22.506 --> 04:24.497
He should be fine after a few days' rest.

04:24.626 --> 04:27.186
Ensign Sato has offered
to take charge of the Mess Hall.

04:27.306 --> 04:29.615
She spends some of her free time
in the Galley...

04:29.746 --> 04:32.783
and is eager for an opportunity
to cook for the crew.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.017
If it's all right with Chef.

04:36.466 --> 04:38.377
Let me ask you a question.

04:40.386 --> 04:42.980
I received a manuscript from Earth.

04:43.466 --> 04:45.343
A biography of my father.

04:46.026 --> 04:48.620
I've been asked to write the preface.

04:51.786 --> 04:54.061
Would you mind reading it
when I'm done?

04:54.186 --> 04:55.778
I'd be happy to.

04:57.106 --> 05:01.065
If I can ever get it finished.
I've been putting it off for weeks.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.304
The next two days should provide you
with ample opportunity.

05:04.426 --> 05:06.701
It's not that I haven't had the time.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.497
They only asked for a page.

05:10.346 --> 05:14.021
How am I supposed to sum up
my father's life in a page?

05:15.226 --> 05:18.218
It would have been easier
if they'd asked me to write the book.

05:18.346 --> 05:21.099
Perhaps by focusing on one incident...

05:21.226 --> 05:24.821
a single event that exemplifies
your relationship with your father...

05:24.946 --> 05:27.699
you'll be able to
condense your thoughts.

05:28.506 --> 05:30.178
Logical approach.

05:32.186 --> 05:35.144
Maybe you'd like to write it for me?

05:36.226 --> 05:37.784
I'm hardly qualified.

05:48.426 --> 05:51.145
Chef was planning to make
fried chicken with potatoes...

05:51.266 --> 05:53.985
and some of the Minaran spinach
we picked up on Risa.

05:54.106 --> 05:56.939
- The orange spinach?
- He's convinced it can be made edible.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.979
He can tackle that when he gets back.
I have something else in mind.

06:01.226 --> 06:03.296
It's one of
my grandmother's specialties.

06:03.426 --> 06:06.338
The recipe's been passed down
for generations.

06:06.546 --> 06:09.856
I'll need a translation before
I can program the protein resequencer.

06:09.986 --> 06:14.343
No. You can resequence
all the chicken and potatoes you want...

06:14.466 --> 06:16.934
but I am making this from scratch.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.540
Ensign.

06:30.946 --> 06:33.096
Is there something I can do for you?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.218
I've got a little headache.
Nothing serious.

06:37.706 --> 06:40.061
Why don't you let me have a look?

06:40.346 --> 06:42.223
I was hoping
you'd just give me something.

06:42.346 --> 06:44.257
I'm upgrading the navigation sensors.

06:44.386 --> 06:48.425
It would be irresponsible to dispense
medication without examining you first.

06:48.546 --> 06:49.820
Please.

06:50.546 --> 06:54.334
Any other symptoms?
Dizziness, blurred vision?

06:54.466 --> 06:56.741
- No.
- How long have you had it?

06:57.386 --> 06:59.456
A couple of days, on and off.

06:59.946 --> 07:03.256
I've been meaning to have
you drop by Sickbay, in any case...

07:03.386 --> 07:06.901
to see if you've had any problems
since I removed the neural implants...

07:07.026 --> 07:09.256
you received at the repair station.

07:09.386 --> 07:12.025
You think it could have something
to do with that?

07:12.146 --> 07:13.898
I never rule out anything.

07:14.546 --> 07:18.016
Then again, it could be as innocuous
as muscular tension.

07:19.266 --> 07:20.984
On the other hand...

07:21.466 --> 07:24.583
Terellian plague starts out
with a simple headache.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.778
Then all manner of nasty things
begin to happen.

07:42.586 --> 07:43.860
Commander.

07:51.586 --> 07:53.144
Push it forward.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.702
- That's good, hold it there.
- Commander.

07:58.786 --> 08:00.902
Perhaps you could finish that later.

08:01.826 --> 08:04.101
This may not be as glamorous
as a black hole...

08:04.226 --> 08:05.739
but the Captain gave me an order.

08:05.906 --> 08:09.535
He also requested detailed
sensor readings of this trinary system.

08:09.666 --> 08:12.897
I thought Vulcans had
all this mental focus and discipline.

08:14.266 --> 08:16.416
We also have sensitive hearing.

08:27.706 --> 08:29.742
I'll be in my quarters.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.861
We'll let you know when we're done.

08:36.346 --> 08:38.780
Keep those target
discriminators aligned.

08:38.905 --> 08:42.899
We don't want a torpedo mistaking
our nacelles for enemy vessels.

08:45.186 --> 08:47.222
You asked to see me, Malcolm?

08:47.506 --> 08:51.545
- I would have come to you, Captain.
- It's no problem. What's on your mind?

08:53.026 --> 08:57.224
I've been reviewing our encounters
with hostile species.

08:58.306 --> 09:00.183
The crew's response
has been admirable.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.536
But I feel we can do better, sir.

09:03.506 --> 09:05.224
And you have a proposal?

09:05.666 --> 09:08.863
I've been thinking about
a shipwide emergency alert.

09:08.986 --> 09:12.456
Something a bit more comprehensive
than battle stations.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.778
We're taking far too long to react
to potential threats.

09:15.906 --> 09:18.739
With a single order from you,
or an impact to the hull...

09:18.866 --> 09:21.585
the plating could be polarised,
weapons brought online...

09:21.706 --> 09:22.934
critical systems secured...

09:23.066 --> 09:26.456
I appreciate your concern, Malcolm,
but this isn't a warship.

09:27.906 --> 09:29.464
That's obvious, sir.

09:30.306 --> 09:33.104
During our last run-in with the Suliban...

09:33.346 --> 09:37.385
we were unprepared
for their boarding parties.

09:37.506 --> 09:38.780
When the Mazarites attacked...

09:38.906 --> 09:41.500
they disabled our aft sensors
with their first shot.

09:41.626 --> 09:43.696
- The list goes on.
- I can see that.

09:48.906 --> 09:51.374
Run this by the senior officers...

09:51.626 --> 09:54.618
get some feedback, and we'll talk again.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.545
- Yes, sir.
- And, Malcolm...

10:00.226 --> 10:02.262
don't call it "battle stations."

10:03.426 --> 10:05.701
Think of something less aggressive.

10:22.466 --> 10:23.865
How is it?

10:25.226 --> 10:26.818
"Condition Red"?

10:27.706 --> 10:31.335
What about "Condition Red"
for the new security protocol?

10:31.586 --> 10:34.180
Why don't you just call it
"Security Protocol"?

10:34.306 --> 10:36.456
Well, that's not very dynamic.

10:37.546 --> 10:40.014
Do you think a cupholder's too much?

10:40.746 --> 10:43.465
- Beg your pardon?
- For the Captain's chair.

10:43.586 --> 10:47.864
He just wanted the seat adjusted, but
I figured as long as I'm working on it...

10:48.106 --> 10:50.574
Just what the Captain needs in a crisis:

10:50.706 --> 10:52.458
A place to rest his beverage.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.054
I'm also upgrading the status displays.

10:55.426 --> 10:58.304
He'll be able to access tactical data
from the armrest.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.860
If you really want to improve
tactical readiness...

11:00.986 --> 11:03.546
why don't you help me
with this protocol?

11:04.906 --> 11:07.374
I'm a little busy right now, Malcolm.

11:07.586 --> 11:09.099
It's a chair.

11:09.266 --> 11:11.461
It's the Captain's chair.

11:12.746 --> 11:16.375
It's just as important as your Reed Alert.

11:16.946 --> 11:19.221
"Reed Alert." That's not bad.

11:19.986 --> 11:21.738
Enjoying your lunch?

11:23.066 --> 11:25.978
Yeah. Thanks, it was terrific.

11:26.306 --> 11:27.659
It's called oden.

11:27.786 --> 11:31.096
Every Japanese family
has their own way of preparing it.

11:32.146 --> 11:35.661
Well, it seems to be a big hit.
Congratulations.

11:35.786 --> 11:39.256
Thank you.
Lieutenant, you barely touched yours.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.658
- It was lovely.
- I'll get you a fresh bowl.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.697
- That's not necessary.
- It's no problem.

11:44.826 --> 11:46.384
Please. Not hungry.

11:48.026 --> 11:50.745
Are you sure
there's nothing wrong with it?

11:51.786 --> 11:54.505
Well, it was a bit salty.

11:55.586 --> 11:56.701
Salty?

12:03.546 --> 12:05.025
It tastes fine.

12:06.426 --> 12:10.021
It just must be me, then.
Everybody else seems to be enjoying it.

12:14.466 --> 12:16.821
- How much longer is this going to take?
- It depends.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.823
- On what?
- Hold still, Ensign.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.097
I have to get back to the Bridge.

12:21.226 --> 12:23.740
I'm afraid you won't be returning
to duty today.

12:23.866 --> 12:25.857
The Captain needs those upgrades.

12:25.986 --> 12:28.659
In medical matters,
my authority overrides the Captain's.

12:28.786 --> 12:30.538
I'm keeping you overnight
for observation.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.464
- Your scans didn't show anything.
- That's what concerns me.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.338
Whatever's afflicting you
may be dormant.

12:35.466 --> 12:37.422
I'm going to run
a full bio-molecular scan...

12:37.546 --> 12:40.060
to see if we can find where it's hiding.

12:40.666 --> 12:44.056
Now lie back and don't move.

12:56.386 --> 12:59.776
When I was about 8 years old,
my father took me on a tour...

12:59.906 --> 13:03.216
of the warp 5 facility
outside of Bozeman, Montana.

13:05.266 --> 13:07.700
He introduced me
to the people he worked with...

13:07.826 --> 13:11.978
scientists with names like
Tasaki and Cochrane.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.626
At the time, I didn't realise
the significance of those names...

13:15.626 --> 13:17.139
At the time, I didn't realise
the significance of those names...

13:18.226 --> 13:22.139
or the significance of my father's work.

13:23.186 --> 13:25.905
Computer, pause.
I'll feed you in a minute.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.417
Computer, resume recording.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.339
In a way...

13:35.506 --> 13:39.738
creating a stable warp field mirrored...

13:41.986 --> 13:45.137
the flux of emotions...

13:45.426 --> 13:48.941
my father felt when he...

13:51.026 --> 13:54.018
embarked on... Computer, pause.

13:54.506 --> 13:56.258
Delete the last paragraph.

13:56.386 --> 13:58.104
Hell, delete the whole thing.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.381
Quiet.

14:15.666 --> 14:16.860
Come in.

14:21.146 --> 14:23.376
Here's your sensor interface.

14:24.066 --> 14:25.545
What's the emergency?

14:25.826 --> 14:28.898
This trinary system
is emitting some unusual radiation.

14:29.026 --> 14:30.744
I'm trying to identify it.

14:31.026 --> 14:34.814
You dragged me up here
so you could identify radiation?

14:35.026 --> 14:38.302
- Correct.
- You said it was urgent.

14:38.706 --> 14:40.537
I said it was important.

14:41.346 --> 14:44.543
I get it. You're paying me back...

14:45.666 --> 14:49.375
making me jump through hoops
because I was making too much noise.

14:50.186 --> 14:53.815
You'll be happy to know I moved the
Captain's chair down to Engineering.

14:53.946 --> 14:56.619
So it's nice and quiet on the Bridge now.

14:56.746 --> 14:58.577
I prefer to work here.

15:02.946 --> 15:05.255
I'll need your assistance with this.

15:05.586 --> 15:09.659
Weren't you listening to me?
I don't have time to cater to your whims.

15:09.786 --> 15:12.459
You want your name immortalised
in the Vulcan database...

15:12.586 --> 15:14.895
get someone else to help you do it.

15:15.026 --> 15:17.415
Are you feeling all right, Commander?

15:18.586 --> 15:22.022
I know you don't think this chair's
important, but you're wrong.

15:22.146 --> 15:24.262
What's the most critical component
on this ship?

15:24.386 --> 15:26.900
The main computer, the warp reactor?

15:27.586 --> 15:31.465
It's the crew, and the most important
member of the crew is the Captain.

15:31.586 --> 15:33.895
He makes life-and-death decisions
every day.

15:34.026 --> 15:36.665
The last thing he needs to think
in a critical situation is:

15:36.786 --> 15:40.256
"Gee, I wish this chair
wasn't such a pain in the ass."

15:47.746 --> 15:50.624
- Doctor, when are you going to...
- Wait.

15:54.026 --> 15:56.904
I have just enough time
to shower and get changed.

15:57.026 --> 15:58.664
I haven't discharged you, Ensign.

15:58.786 --> 16:02.620
I haven't slept all night. I'm supposed
to go on duty in 15 minutes.

16:02.746 --> 16:05.260
I need to perform
a cerebral micro-section.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.616
- A what?
- Lie down.

16:10.466 --> 16:13.264
No more tests.
I have to get to the Bridge.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.536
I'm giving you an order.

16:16.546 --> 16:19.299
If I don't finish those upgrades,
I could get a reprimand.

16:19.426 --> 16:20.859
It'll be on my permanent record.

16:20.986 --> 16:23.625
You have more to worry about
than a blemish on your record.

16:23.746 --> 16:25.065
Do you see there?

16:25.466 --> 16:28.458
Your cortical scan
shows elevated levels of serotonin...

16:28.586 --> 16:30.577
and several other neurotransmitters.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.537
- What does that mean?
- I'll let you know...

16:32.666 --> 16:35.021
once I've completed the micro-section.

16:35.986 --> 16:38.978
- Can't it wait until after my shift?
- Absolutely not.

16:39.106 --> 16:41.495
If the Captain doesn't think
I can handle my duties...

16:41.626 --> 16:45.505
I'll be scrubbing plasma conduits
on D-Deck for the next five years.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.137
I could be court-martialed.

16:48.266 --> 16:50.860
What if you're carrying
a protocystian spore...

16:52.066 --> 16:55.297
and you infect the rest of the crew?
How will that reflect on you?

16:55.426 --> 16:57.781
What if you suffer a seizure
at the helm...

16:57.906 --> 17:00.215
because you've contracted
Andronesian encephalitis?

17:00.346 --> 17:02.940
There is something wrong
with you, Ensign...

17:03.066 --> 17:05.261
and I intend to find out what it is.

17:07.506 --> 17:09.815
Not today. Not during my shift.

17:09.986 --> 17:13.979
Unless you're ready to tie me
to a bio-bed, I'm going back to my helm.

17:15.786 --> 17:19.222
At least let me give you an analgesic
for the headache.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.300
That's all I wanted in the first place.

17:31.226 --> 17:34.536
If it gets any worse,
or you suffer any other symptoms...

17:34.986 --> 17:36.817
return here immediately.

17:42.226 --> 17:43.864
What did you...

17:55.866 --> 17:58.460
I've been working on
the new security protocol.

17:58.586 --> 18:02.659
Obviously, the reactor must be secured
immediately during a Tactical Alert.

18:02.786 --> 18:03.980
"Tactical Alert"?

18:04.106 --> 18:08.418
I considered your suggestion,
"Reed Alert," but it seemed narcissistic.

18:08.586 --> 18:10.975
Hand me that hyperspanner, would you?

18:11.106 --> 18:13.939
I've also been working on
a new alert signal.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.864
Tell me what you think.

18:20.386 --> 18:21.944
Or this one?

18:26.826 --> 18:28.942
- Which do you prefer?
- For what?

18:29.746 --> 18:31.384
A Tactical Alert.

18:31.506 --> 18:33.497
They both sound like a bagful of cats.

18:33.626 --> 18:36.015
They were designed
to get your attention.

18:36.506 --> 18:39.259
I'll look this over and get back to you.

18:40.186 --> 18:44.065
I also need your help
on an emergency shutdown procedure...

18:44.186 --> 18:45.699
for the EPS grid.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.624
I said, I'll get back to you.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.335
Fine.

18:51.466 --> 18:55.459
Let's hope we don't have a catastrophic
reactor breach in the meantime.

18:57.626 --> 19:00.220
One of your boys borrowed
my laser micrometer.

19:00.346 --> 19:03.816
If you're heading to the Armoury,
could you get it back for me?

19:11.746 --> 19:13.862
Ensign, if we don't serve
something soon...

19:13.986 --> 19:16.216
we're going to have a riot on our hands.

19:16.346 --> 19:17.938
Is this too salty?

19:22.386 --> 19:24.138
Something's not right.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.180
Hand me the Kreetassan spice.
I'll add it to the stock.

19:27.306 --> 19:28.421
I'm out of carrots.

19:28.546 --> 19:30.582
- There are 25 people...
- Carrots!

19:36.186 --> 19:39.462
With all due respect, you've been
cooking the same meal over and over.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.065
I'm in charge of the Galley.

19:41.186 --> 19:43.302
- I understand.
- You're relieved.

19:43.826 --> 19:45.942
- Ma'am...
- Get out!

19:58.066 --> 20:01.183
- Lieutenant, I need your...
- Clearance code?

20:03.266 --> 20:06.383
- I beg your pardon?
- What is your clearance code?

20:08.146 --> 20:10.137
The Armoury is a restricted area.

20:12.187 --> 20:14.257
Even to the First Officer?

20:15.467 --> 20:18.265
How do I know you are the First Officer?

20:18.387 --> 20:21.459
We've encountered species
that can alter their appearance.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.418
They could masquerade
as any one of us.

20:23.547 --> 20:25.458
I've issued codes to all senior officers...

20:25.587 --> 20:28.260
to reveal if the ship's been infiltrated
by impostors.

20:28.387 --> 20:30.298
Part of your new security protocol?

20:30.427 --> 20:33.544
It was sent to your console
as a voice-encrypted command packet.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.579
I haven't been to the Bridge
for several hours.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.300
As I was saying...

20:39.427 --> 20:42.499
I need assistance establishing
a sensor interface in my quarters.

20:42.627 --> 20:46.506
I've asked Commander Tucker,
but he became agitated.

20:47.907 --> 20:50.501
It was uncharacteristic, even for him.

20:52.707 --> 20:55.779
Have you noticed anything abnormal
about his behaviour?

20:56.307 --> 20:59.299
Why do you want to access
the sensor array...

21:00.427 --> 21:02.019
from your quarters?

21:02.147 --> 21:05.105
I was asked to run detailed scans
of the trinary star system.

21:05.227 --> 21:06.865
I wasn't informed.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.939
It isn't a tactical issue.

21:10.107 --> 21:13.304
Lieutenant, why are you armed?

21:14.547 --> 21:18.017
From now on, security personnel
are to wear sidearms...

21:18.147 --> 21:20.103
in all restricted areas.

21:20.227 --> 21:23.219
- You've cleared this with the Captain?
- It's in my proposal.

21:23.347 --> 21:24.905
Has he approved your proposal?

21:25.027 --> 21:27.746
I've been trying to get him
more interested in security...

21:27.867 --> 21:29.858
since we left space dock.

21:30.147 --> 21:32.945
But he's more interested
in fraternising with the crew...

21:33.067 --> 21:36.139
inviting them to breakfast,
and to watch water polo.

21:37.027 --> 21:40.064
I intend to implement
some long overdue changes.

21:40.187 --> 21:44.544
If the Captain won't approve them,
I'll go directly to Starfleet Command.

21:45.747 --> 21:47.703
Was there anything else?

21:48.667 --> 21:49.656
No.

21:51.907 --> 21:55.900
I soon realised the odd behaviour
wasn't limited to Commander Tucker.

21:56.027 --> 21:59.815
In fact, everyone I encountered
was acting strangely...

22:00.427 --> 22:04.102
growing consumed
with matters that seemed trivial at best.

22:05.107 --> 22:08.702
I also discovered that
although I appeared to be immune...

22:09.307 --> 22:10.706
the Captain was not.

22:19.747 --> 22:21.305
What happened to my chair?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.816
Did you know this chair
is the exact same model...

22:23.947 --> 22:26.666
used on Neptune-Class survey ships?

22:27.427 --> 22:29.383
Is that why you called me down here?

22:29.507 --> 22:34.262
Enterprise is the first warp 5 vessel
in human history, the pride of the fleet.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.378
You're sitting in a chair
they've been using...

22:36.507 --> 22:38.782
on warp 2 ships for over a decade.

22:38.907 --> 22:40.340
You deserve better.

22:41.547 --> 22:43.663
So I'm starting from scratch.

22:43.787 --> 22:47.018
I'm going to build you a throne.
Stand right there.

22:49.507 --> 22:52.658
I need to get a few parametric scans
to get your exact dimensions.

22:52.827 --> 22:55.216
This baby's going to fit like a glove.

22:56.267 --> 22:58.622
Isn't that used for aligning phase coils?

22:58.747 --> 23:00.499
You won't feel a thing.

23:03.867 --> 23:06.939
As long as I'm down here,
maybe I can get your opinion.

23:07.067 --> 23:08.500
Don't move.

23:11.467 --> 23:13.617
"How does one measure
a man's legacy?

23:14.187 --> 23:14.787
"Is it defined by the works he's created?

23:14.787 --> 23:16.266
"Is it defined by the works he's created?

23:16.427 --> 23:19.703
"The technological advances
that will forever alter human history?"

23:19.827 --> 23:21.101
Turn around.

23:23.947 --> 23:27.303
"If so, then no man
since Zefram Cochrane himself...

23:27.427 --> 23:30.863
"has made a more lasting contribution
to the future of humankind...

23:30.987 --> 23:33.820
"than my father, Dr Henry Archer."

23:34.147 --> 23:35.375
All done.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.777
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

23:40.867 --> 23:42.698
Let me read you the rest.

23:42.827 --> 23:44.545
I really need to get to work on this.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.419
- Just a few more pages.
- How many more?

23:46.547 --> 23:47.741
Nineteen.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.258
Nineteen? Are you writing the preface
or the book?

23:51.867 --> 23:54.700
- I've got a lot to say.
- No kidding.

23:56.507 --> 23:58.816
What's that supposed to mean?

23:58.947 --> 24:02.622
If I may, sir, it's a little long-winded.

24:04.947 --> 24:07.177
You're lucky you're a decent engineer...

24:07.307 --> 24:10.663
because you obviously
don't know anything about writing.

24:10.787 --> 24:12.345
I'm not the only one.

24:21.987 --> 24:24.376
I have 83 people to feed,
not just senior officers.

24:24.507 --> 24:26.543
All I requested
was a bowl of plomeek broth.

24:26.667 --> 24:29.659
I don't have time for special orders.
You'll like this better.

24:29.787 --> 24:32.381
- Where's lunch?
- It'll be ready in one minute, sir.

24:32.507 --> 24:33.462
I don't have a minute.

24:33.587 --> 24:36.181
If you're so hungry,
fix yourself a sandwich.

24:41.227 --> 24:43.183
Captain, may I speak with you?

24:43.707 --> 24:47.541
That is a very complex recipe.
I will not serve it until it's just right!

24:47.667 --> 24:49.976
My family's reputation is at stake.

24:52.827 --> 24:56.661
This is a Tactical Alert.
All hands report to your stations.

24:58.627 --> 25:01.266
I repeat, this is a Tactical Alert.

25:07.907 --> 25:08.862
Report.

25:08.987 --> 25:11.455
The crew's response was unacceptable.

25:11.587 --> 25:13.737
38% of them failed to report
to their stations.

25:13.867 --> 25:17.223
Critical systems haven't been secured.
I haven't heard from Engineering.

25:17.347 --> 25:19.781
Shut off that damn noise! Shut it off!

25:19.987 --> 25:22.501
I don't recall authorising a tactical drill.

25:22.627 --> 25:26.017
It wouldn't be much of a drill
if everybody knew about it, sir.

25:26.627 --> 25:29.266
- One minute and 15 seconds.
- What?

25:29.387 --> 25:33.062
It took you one minute and 15 seconds
to reach your post.

25:33.347 --> 25:35.383
I'd expect more
of our commanding officer...

25:35.507 --> 25:37.896
given that the crew
just might follow his example.

25:38.027 --> 25:39.221
Captain!

25:39.787 --> 25:42.062
One minute and 49 seconds.

25:43.187 --> 25:45.223
You might want to see this, sir.

25:45.347 --> 25:48.020
Interactive status displays,
secondary helm control.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.819
It's even got inertial micro-dampers.

25:49.947 --> 25:52.825
The ship could be shakin' apart
and you'd hardly feel a thing.

25:52.987 --> 25:55.501
You ignored a Tactical Alert for this?

25:55.627 --> 25:57.822
I want to run some colours by you
for the headrest.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.539
This is all a big joke to you!

25:59.667 --> 26:02.625
- Give it a rest!
- This isn't a bloody pleasure cruise!

26:02.747 --> 26:05.864
Without proper discipline on this ship,
this mission is doomed!

26:05.987 --> 26:08.899
Why don't you go play soldier
somewhere else?

26:09.307 --> 26:12.856
If this were a military situation,
you'd be taken out and shot.

26:16.627 --> 26:20.142
I don't care what colour the headrest is,
or whether it serves iced tea.

26:20.267 --> 26:22.178
I just want a place to sit
when I'm on duty.

26:22.307 --> 26:26.266
And if I hear that alarm one more time,
I may have you taken out and shot.

26:30.387 --> 26:33.299
Unless there's a real emergency,
like a reactor breach...

26:33.427 --> 26:35.577
I don't want to be disturbed.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.295
Go away.

26:52.827 --> 26:55.057
Do I have to start locking my door?

26:55.387 --> 26:58.106
You said to interrupt you
if there was an emergency.

26:58.227 --> 27:00.741
- I believe there is.
- Is that right?

27:02.067 --> 27:04.661
The crew's behaviour
has become erratic.

27:05.467 --> 27:08.857
Even by human standards,
they've grown distracted.

27:10.307 --> 27:14.698
Everyone I've encountered appears
to be preoccupied with trivial matters.

27:17.027 --> 27:19.461
Ensign Sato's recipe, for example.

27:20.547 --> 27:23.744
Your preface. We should declare
a medical emergency...

27:23.867 --> 27:27.826
and have Dr Phlox examine the crew.
I suggest he begin with you.

27:38.187 --> 27:39.415
I'm busy.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.340
- Captain...
- Dismissed.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.742
- Your crew is in danger.
- I gave you an order.

27:46.867 --> 27:49.427
- Captain...
- I suggest you follow it...

27:49.707 --> 27:52.346
or I'll have you confined
to your quarters...

27:52.467 --> 27:56.062
until a Vulcan ship can come
and get you.

28:12.147 --> 28:14.741
You're just in time, Subcommander.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.745
There's a surgical gown
in the compartment by the microscope.

28:17.867 --> 28:21.018
This is a rare opportunity
to explore the human brain.

28:21.147 --> 28:22.421
Was he injured?

28:22.547 --> 28:26.506
A headache. At first, I thought
it was a simple vascular dilation.

28:26.627 --> 28:28.458
But then I discovered...

28:29.907 --> 28:32.865
a chemical imbalance
in his prefrontal cortex.

28:33.427 --> 28:37.625
I'm going to begin by extracting
the first 12 mm of his parietal lobe.

28:38.147 --> 28:42.220
A sub-cellular analysis of the tissue
should shed some light on the mystery.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.907
Doctor, you may want to delay
the procedure.

28:45.027 --> 28:48.417
We have a larger problem.
The entire crew is ill.

28:50.507 --> 28:52.259
They'll have to wait.

28:57.427 --> 28:59.418
You've been affected as well.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.018
Please remove your hand.

29:04.787 --> 29:06.539
I won't ask you again.

29:12.267 --> 29:15.145
I'll let you know
when I've completed the surgery.

30:11.987 --> 30:14.262
The crew's bio-signs
were growing erratic.

30:14.387 --> 30:17.538
I began to doubt any of them
would survive more than a few hours.

30:17.667 --> 30:21.023
Ironically, Dr Phlox's obsession
with Ensign Mayweather's headache...

30:21.147 --> 30:22.660
has provided some useful data.

30:22.787 --> 30:25.096
His cerebral scans
have helped me determine that...

30:25.227 --> 30:28.583
the radiation coming
from the trinary system is causing...

30:29.827 --> 30:31.385
Computer, pause.

30:33.787 --> 30:35.345
Computer, resume log.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.862
My radiometric analysis is complete.

30:38.987 --> 30:43.663
As I suspected, reversing course won't
take us out of danger quickly enough.

30:43.867 --> 30:47.098
The radiation appears to extend
outward at least half a light-year...

30:47.227 --> 30:48.785
in every direction except one.

30:48.907 --> 30:51.216
If I can chart a course
between the stars...

30:51.347 --> 30:54.623
we could escape the radiation
before the crew succumbs.

30:55.067 --> 30:57.581
But I won't be able
to pilot the ship alone.

31:00.347 --> 31:01.575
Captain!

31:02.547 --> 31:04.060
Captain Archer.

31:05.027 --> 31:08.542
- You're needed on the Bridge.
- I told you not to disturb me.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.545
We have very little time.

31:10.667 --> 31:13.659
- What are you doing?
- Your crew may be dying.

31:14.147 --> 31:15.262
What?

31:15.387 --> 31:17.617
Do you remember
that trinary star system?

31:17.747 --> 31:19.544
The one with the black hole?

31:19.667 --> 31:22.306
It's emitting a dangerous form
of radiation.

31:23.747 --> 31:26.181
It's affecting your prefrontal cortex.

31:26.307 --> 31:30.186
That's why you and the crew have
been exhibiting obsessive behaviour.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.777
Some of the crew's bio-signs
are already unstable.

31:37.827 --> 31:41.786
If you're exposed to the radiation
much longer, you won't survive.

31:56.267 --> 31:58.986
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

31:59.107 --> 32:01.621
- Turn it off.
- Do you understand?

32:01.947 --> 32:04.620
Yes. Radiation.

32:06.427 --> 32:08.941
Tell Phlox if...

32:10.347 --> 32:11.905
the crew's sick...

32:13.187 --> 32:16.099
- Tell Phlox...
- He's been affected as well.

32:17.547 --> 32:18.821
But not you?

32:18.947 --> 32:21.222
Vulcan physiology seems to be immune.

32:22.587 --> 32:24.066
Bring us about.

32:25.867 --> 32:27.619
Turn the ship around.

32:36.347 --> 32:39.703
It's not that simple.
If we go back the way we came...

32:39.827 --> 32:42.944
we'll spend two more days
in the radiation field.

32:45.387 --> 32:47.184
I've charted a course.

32:47.987 --> 32:52.105
It'll have us clear of the radiation
in less than 17 minutes.

32:53.707 --> 32:55.106
Lousy coffee.

32:55.827 --> 33:00.105
But we'll have to pass
within 2 million km of the black hole.

33:00.307 --> 33:03.538
There's considerable debris
and gravitational shear.

33:07.187 --> 33:08.745
Someone needs to pilot Enterprise...

33:08.867 --> 33:11.586
while I determine
the course corrections.

33:14.107 --> 33:16.257
- Travis.
- He's been sedated.

33:19.947 --> 33:24.463
I'm in no condition to fly a starship.

33:25.507 --> 33:27.418
We have no other choice.

33:46.187 --> 33:50.260
More gravitational shear.
We're too far to port.

33:51.027 --> 33:53.587
But you said Bearing 2.4.

33:54.187 --> 33:57.145
- 12.4.
- My mistake.

34:00.387 --> 34:02.503
12.4.

34:06.467 --> 34:09.027
How much longer is this going to take?

34:10.387 --> 34:11.536
Six minutes.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.304
I'm good for that.

34:13.987 --> 34:15.545
Another shear front.

34:15.667 --> 34:19.262
We need to rotate
our longitudinal axis by 12 degrees...

34:19.547 --> 34:23.460
and bring our flight vector
to 014 mark 27.

34:23.587 --> 34:26.147
Hold on! Zero what?

34:26.306 --> 34:29.504
- 014 mark...
- Mark 27.

34:38.027 --> 34:41.018
Just minor debris.
The hull plating is holding.

34:42.107 --> 34:44.337
Our lateral vector is drifting.

34:45.347 --> 34:46.541
Captain.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.185
Hang on a second.

34:50.507 --> 34:53.704
I feel like I'm in flight school again.

34:54.627 --> 34:56.219
You're doing well.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.020
New heading:

34:59.027 --> 35:01.780
006 mark 4.

35:09.627 --> 35:11.697
- Captain.
- I see it.

35:20.067 --> 35:23.662
- We need phase cannons.
- They'd take too long to charge.

35:32.267 --> 35:34.178
All weapons are online.

35:34.747 --> 35:36.942
It must be part of
the new security protocol.

35:37.067 --> 35:38.136
Fire!

35:55.387 --> 35:57.298
Could you shut that off?

36:02.267 --> 36:03.825
How much longer?

36:04.787 --> 36:06.539
Less than 10 seconds.

36:11.387 --> 36:13.025
Five more seconds.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.819
Any more surprises?

36:24.267 --> 36:25.939
Nothing on sensors.

36:38.747 --> 36:41.819
Did we get some nice pictures
of the black hole?

36:55.387 --> 36:57.105
How are you feeling?

36:57.227 --> 36:59.900
A little tired, but the headache's gone.

37:00.267 --> 37:03.145
- What did you do?
- Very little, fortunately.

37:03.867 --> 37:05.505
You're free to go.

37:07.227 --> 37:08.421
Captain.

37:11.627 --> 37:12.776
How's the crew?

37:12.907 --> 37:16.536
I'm continuing to monitor vital signs,
but I've detected...

37:16.947 --> 37:18.778
no lingering effects from the radiation.

37:18.907 --> 37:21.705
Mostly just rattled nerves,
a few bruises and sprains...

37:21.827 --> 37:24.580
from when some of them
lost consciousness.

37:26.107 --> 37:29.417
I appreciate your intervening
before I got any further...

37:29.547 --> 37:31.822
with Mr Mayweather's procedure.

37:31.987 --> 37:34.455
I wasn't certain it would work
on a Denobulan.

37:34.587 --> 37:36.782
It worked quite effectively,
I can assure you.

37:36.907 --> 37:39.262
What procedure on Mr Mayweather?

37:40.147 --> 37:43.503
The radiation affected
my nervous system rather severely.

37:43.627 --> 37:45.583
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Okay, Doctor.

37:45.707 --> 37:50.098
I'll provide you with a full report
when I've finished treating the crew.

37:54.547 --> 37:57.107
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- I did.

38:01.187 --> 38:04.463
When T'Pol and I
were navigating the debris field...

38:04.947 --> 38:08.735
- your Tactical Alert went off.
- I heard, sir.

38:08.867 --> 38:11.665
I've already deactivated
the new protocols.

38:12.947 --> 38:14.619
You shouldn't have.

38:15.667 --> 38:19.342
They brought the weapons online
right when we needed them.

38:19.467 --> 38:24.063
If you have no objection,
I'd like to make it standard procedure.

38:25.747 --> 38:27.385
No objection, sir.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.827
You still need to work on that alarm.

38:34.387 --> 38:36.139
I'll get right on it.

38:46.147 --> 38:48.502
It doesn't look any different to me.

38:48.907 --> 38:50.340
Give it a try.

39:07.067 --> 39:09.137
Feels better. What did you do?

39:10.107 --> 39:11.665
Cross your legs.

39:17.227 --> 39:20.458
What did you do?
It seems totally different.

39:22.067 --> 39:23.500
I lowered it...

39:24.107 --> 39:25.586
by one centimetre.

39:28.187 --> 39:29.461
That's all?

39:29.987 --> 39:32.581
Didn't have time to install
the new status displays...

39:32.707 --> 39:36.586
or the inertial micro-dampers,
but if you give me a couple of days...

39:37.227 --> 39:40.025
I think this will be fine,
Commander. Thanks.

39:40.147 --> 39:43.378
- How about I just attach the cupholder?
- This will be fine.

39:43.507 --> 39:44.781
All right.

40:08.187 --> 40:09.859
How does this sound?
