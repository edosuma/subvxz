36:30.113 --> 36:34.250

36:48.506 --> 36:53.289
(breaking news audio)

36:57.010 --> 36:57.843
- Good evening.

36:57.843 --> 37:00.280
We're on Austin road for what
police are calling another

37:00.280 --> 37:02.640
senseless murder in the city right now.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.230
Very limited information
that we have at this point.

37:05.230 --> 37:08.010
But they say that a confidential
informant was shot and

37:08.010 --> 37:10.860
killed here at this pool
home for what they're saying,

37:10.860 --> 37:13.670
a deal gone bad. According to detectives,

37:13.670 --> 37:16.330
they say that they have reason
to believe the shooting may

37:16.330 --> 37:18.680
be connected to an auto repair shop.

37:18.680 --> 37:21.700
That's expecting to get
a large shipment of guns.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.090
But at this point they're
still trying to confirm all of

37:24.090 --> 37:25.030
that information.

37:25.030 --> 37:27.480
They're talking to witnesses
and they're also talking to

37:27.480 --> 37:31.170
neighbors to see exactly
what they have heard or seen.

37:31.170 --> 37:34.090
And ma'am you seem to be in shock here.

37:34.090 --> 37:36.074
Were you around this area

37:36.074 --> 37:40.168
- I told y'all he was a snitch,
I told y'all he was snitchin

37:40.168 --> 37:41.063

37:41.063 --> 37:46.037

38:13.120 --> 38:15.635
Like we need to count this money ASAP.

38:15.635 --> 38:16.690
(indistinct chatter)

38:16.690 --> 38:17.570
I understand that,

38:17.570 --> 38:21.520
but you don't understand how
Marcus is on my neck and he

38:23.750 --> 38:26.320

38:26.320 --> 38:29.730
I'm tired of counting this

38:29.730 --> 38:33.600

38:49.341 --> 38:50.449

38:54.110 --> 38:55.080
I don't know. What you talking about?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.060
What'd you talking about the shop?

38:57.060 --> 38:59.210
I don't know somebody was wearing a wire.

38:59.210 --> 39:02.070
- Ah wire.. Who the
fuck was wearing a wire?

39:02.070 --> 39:03.270
I'm not going to jail.

39:03.270 --> 39:04.390
- I'm definitely not going to jail.

39:04.390 --> 39:05.633
Look at me.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.320

39:15.570 --> 39:18.340
Marcus is taking care of
everything that you don't need to

39:18.340 --> 39:21.350
worry about. Only thing
you worry about is this.

39:21.350 --> 39:24.070
He take care of me. I

39:27.228 --> 39:28.228
- All right.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.460
- And ma'am you seem to be in shock here.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.450
Were you around this area
when you heard gunshots?

39:39.450 --> 39:42.487
Yea, I lived two doors down
and I heard two shots and ...

39:43.800 --> 39:44.640
bunch of commotion.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.430
So I wanted to come home

39:46.430 --> 39:48.730
Cause it don't happen

39:48.730 --> 39:50.010

1:03:53.299 --> 1:03:56.132

1:09:41.740 --> 1:09:44.530
So just think in a minute we
going to be somewhere sipping.

1:09:44.530 --> 1:09:47.290
My mother says get in a teen girl.

1:09:47.290 --> 1:09:49.403
You already know I got my bags packed.

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:51.753
- Yeah.

1:10:08.249 --> 1:10:09.082
Yes.

1:10:10.490 --> 1:10:11.323
I just got,

1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:20.640
and we're going to flood the
call city with these bags that

1:10:25.430 --> 1:10:26.870
yo smoke.

1:10:26.870 --> 1:10:31.200
What you got going on? No,
I'm looking at what he does.

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:33.903
They ready to ship? They
look and they read it.

1:10:35.730 --> 1:10:37.553
What's the tracking numbers on the bus.

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:39.997
38, 24.

1:10:42.979 --> 1:10:44.579
I wonder where to drop them off.

1:10:47.650 --> 1:10:50.300
Can he let me speak to him?

1:10:50.300 --> 1:10:51.133
- Yeah.

1:10:56.770 --> 1:10:59.380
- Marcus holler at me, man, whatever.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:02.820
Like, Hey man, every tag
is all good in the hood.

1:11:02.820 --> 1:11:05.250
Maybe it's Christmas in June.

1:11:05.250 --> 1:11:08.270
For sure we could. I
mean, everything's secure,

1:11:08.270 --> 1:11:10.563
boxed up the road.

1:11:12.949 --> 1:11:14.060
It needs your, I talked.

1:11:14.060 --> 1:11:18.350
- To him in the last ship.

1:11:25.870 --> 1:11:26.703
Fish.

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:30.800
- Doubt. Now snow breath loss.

1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:32.940
Cause he face down in the river.

1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:36.300
Deep unfounded such for
blood, like a great house.

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:39.610
Full clip will make bell
smile, voice song, no pill.

1:11:39.610 --> 1:11:41.533
It's home long lines with the.

1:11:44.190 --> 1:11:46.550
There is no justice thing. You
know that there is no peace.

1:11:46.550 --> 1:11:47.920
We lived in die in the streets.

1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:50.800
We bang your name in front
of all enemies. You know,

1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:53.210
we never be true. We case will defeat.

1:11:53.210 --> 1:11:55.560
These will this bring it
to the, keep the price.

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:56.393
It doesn't come cheap.

1:11:56.393 --> 1:11:59.600
I'm ready for war my buddy
on my unit. I pray to God.

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:02.437
I don't treat a brother's
dying. Mama's crying,

1:12:02.437 --> 1:12:03.633
crying on top.

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.150
search on the coast whose
work in the remedied.

1:12:10.150 --> 1:12:13.920
Unfound rev loss. Now
was no sound face down.

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:15.957
Cause he gunned down. Hands up.

1:12:47.309 --> 1:12:49.059
- Everyone guns down.

1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:05.163
You have to.

1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:08.550
- Mark is this is tip. Give me a call.

1:13:08.550 --> 1:13:10.490
Okay. I know you're
ready to make the drop,

1:13:10.490 --> 1:13:13.290
but we just finished doing
an account. So hit me up.

1:13:13.290 --> 1:13:14.123
- Bye.

1:14:13.033 --> 1:14:14.913
- That's all.

1:14:14.913 --> 1:14:16.143
I think we need to talk.

1:14:19.980 --> 1:14:23.099
- You've been lying to me since
we've met and I need to know

1:14:23.099 --> 1:14:24.223
if you know these people.

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.560
- The only reason I lie to
you because I don't want you

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.010
judging me for what I'm into.

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:31.800
- So is your real name DeMarcus Tyler.

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:36.433
- Yeah.

1:14:39.290 --> 1:14:40.333
- All right.

1:14:41.290 --> 1:14:42.903
Did you kill the informant?

1:14:44.410 --> 1:14:45.243
- I sure.

1:14:46.390 --> 1:14:47.827
- All right, Marcus, in
order for me to help you,

1:14:47.827 --> 1:14:50.270
you have to be honest with me.

1:14:50.270 --> 1:14:51.463
So did you shoot him?

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.120
- I shoot.

1:14:54.120 --> 1:14:55.403
Katie know who shot him?

1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:00.470
Yeah.

1:15:00.470 --> 1:15:01.970
- Do we know where the gun is?

1:15:04.479 --> 1:15:05.510
- I don't know what is on that.

1:15:05.510 --> 1:15:08.980
- Okay. I have to know the
truth so that I can help you.

1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:10.563
Do you know where the gun is?

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:13.793
- Okay.

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:18.640
Let me think.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:20.470
- I think I have an idea,

1:15:20.470 --> 1:15:22.770
but I'm going to have
to have you wear a wire.

1:15:24.450 --> 1:15:26.693
- I know I'm to window wild.

1:15:26.693 --> 1:15:29.390
What you talking about in
order for me to get you out of

1:15:29.390 --> 1:15:33.498
this, you need to make your why,

1:15:33.498 --> 1:15:34.580
you know what you're
talking about? You know,

1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:37.503
the people I work with,
I'm not wearing a wire.

1:15:39.150 --> 1:15:41.660
- But you have to understand
if we don't have a gun,

1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:43.950
we have to have something
else to cover your tracks.

1:15:43.950 --> 1:15:45.810
So if you wear the wire,

1:15:45.810 --> 1:15:50.090
we can get you guys talking
about business from the shop and

1:15:50.090 --> 1:15:53.560
I can switch that out, but
you have to wear a wire.

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:55.093
That's my only other option.

1:15:56.680 --> 1:15:59.853
- So if I wait while all
is, well, all of you are,

1:16:01.410 --> 1:16:03.900
if you wear the wire, all of you are

1:16:08.130 --> 1:16:09.443
you all lock girls?

1:16:18.010 --> 1:16:19.110
What am I going to do?

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:24.253
- Paula markers.

1:16:25.180 --> 1:16:30.180
So if Brian to say what? Under
the in the rest of the money.

1:16:31.590 --> 1:16:32.963
Almost us less, bro.

1:16:46.190 --> 1:16:48.023
what about the gloves?

1:16:51.268 --> 1:16:54.185
knows the histories better on this.

1:17:11.158 --> 1:17:12.241
- Okay. Okay.

1:17:20.869 --> 1:17:22.702
- So how are you doing

1:17:28.950 --> 1:17:30.360
at this point?

1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:33.293
I'm just trying to help
his legacy to live on it.

1:17:34.421 --> 1:17:39.421
And then that got to do something.

1:17:39.510 --> 1:17:41.370
We can't go on like this forever,

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:45.730
but I definitely have some
people that's going to help us

1:17:45.730 --> 1:17:48.120
out or whatever. I got
like 150 people say,

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:49.620
they'll come out to the rally.

1:17:51.270 --> 1:17:52.980
That's a good start.

1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:57.760
We need to figure out a really
good plan and execute the

1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:58.593
case. I mean,

1:17:58.593 --> 1:18:03.020
if nobody else is gonna
take action and stop this,

1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:05.780
we do just the beginning of this year.

1:18:05.780 --> 1:18:09.910
We've had 40 deaths by us. Wow.

1:18:09.910 --> 1:18:12.120
Did you catch the news last week?

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:15.873
The little two year old
gun down on her porch.

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:19.830
Good John. So heartbreaking.

1:18:19.830 --> 1:18:21.910
It really hit home. When you have a son,

1:18:21.910 --> 1:18:24.929
like you just you'd be so scared for them.

1:18:24.929 --> 1:18:26.560
Like you don't know how
stuff's going to go.

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:29.810
When they get older, these boys
hopping off the porch at 10,

1:18:29.810 --> 1:18:33.600
11 years old, they going to the park plan,

1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:35.070
but they feel like they gotta be strapped.

1:18:35.070 --> 1:18:39.130
The play grading sheet terrifies
me having a son. And like,

1:18:39.130 --> 1:18:42.570
I don't know what his life going to be.

1:18:42.570 --> 1:18:45.640
He can't do this. No more girl.

1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:47.872
We gotta do something.

1:18:47.872 --> 1:18:49.310
Yeah. It's just getting worse and worse.

1:18:49.310 --> 1:18:50.900
Nobody is going to stop
this. We need to somebody,

1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:55.900
I guess it's going to have to
be us. So let's get started.

1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:03.830
- Right here being patient.

1:19:06.430 --> 1:19:08.330
You can't literally commit right here.

1:19:33.610 --> 1:19:36.043
location. Get the money to go.

1:19:38.690 --> 1:19:40.640
Make sure he'll be ready for the truck.

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:44.567
His last man, all over the city right now.

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:24.913
want to cry.

1:21:26.450 --> 1:21:27.440
- We're here downtown.

1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:30.590
Where a group of protesters
have gathered speaking out about

1:21:30.590 --> 1:21:32.350
the gun violence in the city.

1:21:32.350 --> 1:21:33.950
The mayor says that he will take a second.

1:21:33.950 --> 1:21:35.720
Look at the current gun laws.

1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:39.480
If petitioners can gather
100,000 signatures,

1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:42.580
both the city officials and law
enforcers are greed that the

1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:45.020
gun violence in the city is rising.

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:47.110
So something has got to be done.

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:49.990
We're talking with some
organizers actually about why they

1:21:49.990 --> 1:21:52.850
are here. Why aren't you protesting today?

1:21:52.850 --> 1:21:56.420
Well, I wanted to do something
great for the community.

1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:59.550
We've been having a lot of
killings and a lot of gun

1:21:59.550 --> 1:22:01.000
violence going on.

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.920
My father was also a victim of
gun violence and I just want

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:06.897
to do something to pay tribute to him.

1:22:06.897 --> 1:22:09.500
And man, how is this personal for you?

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:12.720
I just lost my boyfriend
a couple of weeks ago,

1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:15.410
due to a straight bully. I
wouldn't wish this pain on it.

1:22:15.410 --> 1:22:18.840
It's got to be something to stop this.

1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:20.330
And ma'am I see you.

1:22:20.330 --> 1:22:24.210
You're wearing a t-shirt in
honor of one of your loved ones.

1:22:24.210 --> 1:22:25.810
Why are you here today? Well,

1:22:25.810 --> 1:22:28.490
he was just the most
recent of many and I mean,

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:33.070
he was gunned down as well as
a lot of protests for their

1:22:33.070 --> 1:22:34.070
loved ones,

1:22:34.070 --> 1:22:36.870
but we're just trying to make
sure this doesn't keep going.

1:22:36.870 --> 1:22:37.703
I mean,

1:22:37.703 --> 1:22:39.720
it's a devastating thing and
the family has to live with it

1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:40.553
forever.

1:22:40.553 --> 1:22:43.790
So we're just trying to make
a positive change and just do

1:22:43.790 --> 1:22:45.190
something positive.

1:22:45.190 --> 1:22:47.290
So we won't have to keep going through it.

1:22:48.180 --> 1:22:51.170
So a simple message with
a lot of power behind it.

1:22:51.170 --> 1:22:52.010
Of course again,

1:22:52.010 --> 1:22:55.920
city leaders and law enforcement
is looking to make a change

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:59.060
with your help reporting live
in downtown Asha, staples,

1:22:59.060 --> 1:22:59.893
Fox 20 news.

1:23:13.789 --> 1:23:15.289
- The rest of the.

1:23:31.550 --> 1:23:36.000
How many crates is seven right now?

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.300
And we've got a truck
load coming in tomorrow.

1:24:33.668 --> 1:24:34.501
- That's what I like to see, right?

1:24:34.501 --> 1:24:35.334
- Yeah.

1:24:37.469 --> 1:24:38.453
Yeah.

1:24:40.210 --> 1:24:41.689
Hard yet.

1:24:41.689 --> 1:24:43.887
- Yeah. And take that for yourself.

1:24:45.350 --> 1:24:47.450
We gotta be extra careful right now.

1:24:47.450 --> 1:24:49.000
We've got a lot of eyes on us right now.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.990
That is still pulling
screens, talking crazy, man.

1:24:52.990 --> 1:24:54.610
But my people on that though, man.

1:24:54.610 --> 1:24:56.880
Appreciate that big man.

1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:59.530
Thank you for that flow.
You made up in Detroit, man.

1:25:01.670 --> 1:25:04.457
I play the bottom of the aunt.
That's what I like to hear.

1:25:04.457 --> 1:25:06.900
Hey, tell me about the connection

1:25:06.900 --> 1:25:10.720

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:12.100
Let me, they going to love this.

1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:13.103
Check this out.

1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:27.640
Take the key. When you wake up,

1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:29.350
grab a few plates and have
your girl's spot to play.

1:25:29.350 --> 1:25:31.690
Someone calls you out to do that.

1:25:31.690 --> 1:25:33.240
Let's say red. What about the blank print?

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.733
By the way I asked you about my bed.

1:25:41.290 --> 1:25:42.123
Oh yeah.

1:25:43.110 --> 1:25:44.470

Oh good. We got where needs

1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:51.170
Hey listen man, we gotta
be extra careful, man.

1:25:51.170 --> 1:25:53.190
This the last drop Mark is a big guy.

1:25:53.190 --> 1:25:54.690
I'm making them off right now.

1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:59.893
Came last one, baby one.

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:20.910
- Got an idea.

1:26:20.910 --> 1:26:22.193
No, he tried to slam man.

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:25.513
- Yes.

1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:10.240
- Okay. Everybody listen up.

1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.240
Get our gun please.

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:16.143
You guys sign this at 40 queue.

1:27:16.143 --> 1:27:19.233
Once we hit a queue, we make our move.

1:27:20.410 --> 1:27:21.823
Nobody moved before that.

1:27:22.990 --> 1:27:24.053
He only got one shot.

1:27:26.330 --> 1:27:31.330
Like I said before, we need
justice for the victims.

1:27:33.820 --> 1:27:37.053
These guys are armed
and extremely dangerous.

1:27:38.790 --> 1:27:39.990
So proceed with caution.

1:27:41.210 --> 1:27:43.500
These guys have no remorse.

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:46.583
They don't care about
anything but money and power.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.583
So let's do our jobs.

1:27:51.740 --> 1:27:53.040

1:28:48.259 --> 1:28:50.509
so we can get through this.

1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:14.713
Take a trip, take a trip.

1:29:19.110 --> 1:29:20.677
Just get away for a minute.

1:29:27.898 --> 1:29:30.520
We need to make this all last.

1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:33.361
Never thought about giving all this up,

1:29:33.361 --> 1:29:36.694
doing some diff giving up what you mean?

1:29:40.309 --> 1:29:41.709

1:30:45.853 --> 1:30:48.186
