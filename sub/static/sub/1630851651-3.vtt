WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:07.257
-Charles, Lizzie!
-Charles! Lizzie, over here!

00:07.341 --> 00:10.427
Are you excited about tonight?
Congratulations. Lizzie, over here.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.929
Charles, give us a smile.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.015
You two look fantastic.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.311
How does it feel
to be named Fosterers of the Year?

00:19.895 --> 00:22.189
It's an honor just to be nominated.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.273
Charles!

00:23.357 --> 00:24.399
Charles?

00:25.526 --> 00:28.487
Charles, do you mind? I have to pack that.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.114
What?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.993
Did you already forget?
It's Maria's birthday.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.579
No, I didn't forget.

00:37.663 --> 00:42.167
You're going to Maria's godmother's ranch
to ride horses and sleep in bunks.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.295
It's a classic "BFF experience."

00:47.464 --> 00:49.675
Okay, I take it back. Good memory.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.136
You know, I love having a best friend.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.265
I mean, I never understood the hype,
but now I get it.

00:56.348 --> 01:00.018
-I guess this makes me head honcho.
-Head honcho? Of what?

01:00.102 --> 01:01.103
Did you forget?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.605
-We're getting a puppy this weekend.
-Not at all.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.233
I was actually gonna make you
a detailed checklist,

01:06.316 --> 01:07.568
but I'm running late.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.070
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay on your own?

01:11.864 --> 01:16.493
-Charles, you are amazing.
-How do you do it all by yourself?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.331
Yeah, I'm sure.
Enjoy your trip. I've got this.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.293
Do I need to give you that speech
about staying out of my room

01:24.376 --> 01:26.295
-while I'm gone?
-No speech necessary.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.797
'Cause you know
that coming in here would be

01:28.881 --> 01:30.757
a major violation.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.718
Promise?

01:33.468 --> 01:34.678
I promise.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.062
-Toothpaste?
-Check.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.522
-Pajamas?
-Sweats, and check.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.815
Maria's birthday present?

01:46.899 --> 01:48.400
-Definite check.
-What'd you get her?

01:48.483 --> 01:51.236
-A friendship bracelet kit.
-So much for having a fun time.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.197
Is someone a little jealous?

01:53.280 --> 01:57.201
Of horseback riding? Definitely.
Bracelet making? Not so much.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.744
Okay, you know what?

01:59.828 --> 02:03.373
Dad, what are you wearing?
Maria's gonna be here any minute.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.251
Don't worry. I promise to take it off
right after she sees me.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.419
Dad!

02:07.503 --> 02:10.631
I borrowed it from Lieutenant Fleckman.
You want it for the weekend?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.716
I'm okay, thanks.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.469
Cool!

02:15.552 --> 02:18.514
Going out of town
with your new best friend.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.141
And you, fostering
a puppy all by yourself.

02:21.225 --> 02:25.020
It's like you don't even need us anymore.
But if you do, for any reason,

02:25.103 --> 02:28.190
use the emergency phone
and I will immediately come to the rescue.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.901
-It's kinda my thing.
-Okay, everyone chill out.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.569
This is so not a big deal.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.488
Maria's here!

02:35.489 --> 02:37.741
Yeah. Not a big deal at all.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.702
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.788
This is for you.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.415
But it's your birthday.
Why are you giving me a present?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.252
They're carrots for Sally,
your horse for the weekend.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.504
She's a red mare
with the most luxurious mane,

02:50.587 --> 02:53.799
-and she sleeps standing up.
-Don't all horses do that?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.635
-You did your homework.
-Always.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.846
-You ready?
-Yeah.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.264
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.768
Okay. Call me if you need any help
with the dog.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.645
-Won't need to!
-Stay out of my room.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.146
Got it!

03:10.858 --> 03:13.151
It's gonna be pretty quiet around here.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.194
Rascal!

03:15.153 --> 03:16.655
Rascal. Rascal's here.

03:19.825 --> 03:23.412
Rascal! Rascal, hey. Calm down.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.496
I am so sorry.

03:24.580 --> 03:28.250
I barely cracked the car door and he was
already sprinting into your backyard.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.043
Hey. Rascal.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.504
Rascal!

03:32.588 --> 03:35.465
It is okay.
I'm sure he's just excited to be here.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.593
He is excited to be anywhere.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.597
We thought that having a small dog
in a small apartment would be perfect,

03:41.680 --> 03:44.433
-but… not Rascal.
-Rascal!

03:44.516 --> 03:49.271
He just needs a home with a lot of space
because all he wants to do is… run.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.692
-You don't say.
-I hope this is not an imposition.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.695
Dr. Abby said that when it came
to foster families,

03:56.778 --> 04:01.533
the Petersons were the-- Oh, my--
first, second and third choice.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.244
-Rascal!
-We'll be sure to thank her for that.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.329
Rascal!

04:06.830 --> 04:09.791
Well, you definitely came
to the right place.

04:09.875 --> 04:14.254
Rascal's in good hands. Rascal! Rascal!

04:16.130 --> 04:18.216
So, how'd you pick the name?

04:28.519 --> 04:31.021
You're the first friend
Maria's brought to the ranch.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.856
You must be a real horse lover.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.360
Well, I definitely love this one.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.905
-That's Munchie. He's a mini horse.
-I see that.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.866
I'm so excited for you.
You're gonna love riding.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.409
You've never been on a horse?

04:44.493 --> 04:47.621
Well, I did do a pony ride
at the mall once, so I'm good.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.132
You are not a mini horse.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.845
He certainly isn't.
This is my new baby, Sir Galahad.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.557
I suggested the name because Sir Galahad
was King Arthur's most noble knight.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.937
He is noble,
but he can also be a big old grump.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.566
Come on. Your horse is over here.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.616
This is Sally.
She loves to have her neck rubbed.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.868
Hi, Sally!

05:27.160 --> 05:29.371
I think you might need a ladder.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.503
Rascal. Rascal?

05:40.966 --> 05:41.967
Hi.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.012
Good. Good boy.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.973
Finally got you.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.809
Rascal!

05:51.560 --> 05:53.395
We've got a little problem here.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.231
Don't worry. I can handle him.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.233
I have a whole training plan.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.819
Do you wanna share
any details of this plan?

06:03.739 --> 06:05.699
Not right now. I gotta catch him first.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.498
You're gonna spoil Sally
with all that brushing.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.876
We're going for a ride,
not a walk down the runway.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.212
She's just so beautiful.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.506
Come on, Lizzie.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.550
Let's ride. You'll have plenty of time
to groom her later.

06:23.634 --> 06:28.055
Are you sure? I think Sally may want
another carrot. She looks hungry to me.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.141
-Does she look hungry to you?
-She's had plenty. Let's mount up.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.979
-What's that?
-Human-grade doggy treat balls.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.649
I made them myself
using my grandma's meatball recipe.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.275
Rascal won't be able to resist.

06:40.359 --> 06:44.071
Maybe we can use them to lure Rascal
out of hiding and back into the mudroom.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.740
How do you know he's hiding?
Maybe he's taking a nap.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.787
I don't think so.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.372
Rascal.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.420
What a view.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.131
So high up here.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.470
Isn't it great?
I get butterflies before every ride.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.391
I'm definitely feeling something.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.643
Lizzie, we're gonna take it nice and slow.

07:14.726 --> 07:18.313
I'll walk you out, and we can stop anytime
if you're not feeling comfortable.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.358
No, I'm-- I'm great. Totally.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.028
All right.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.411
-Rascal?
-Rascal?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.621
Oh, gee.

07:34.705 --> 07:35.789
Oh, no.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.836
We're not allowed in Lizzie's room.

07:46.008 --> 07:50.095
Charles, I know you're trying,
and training can take a while.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.890
You're the best.
Thanks for understanding, Mom.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.311
But you have one day,
or we'll have to find an alternative.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.395
Okay?

08:02.774 --> 08:04.318
Treat ball?

08:09.573 --> 08:10.407
What?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.160
-They're human-grade. Remember?
-Oh, yeah.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.915
-I told you this was fun.
-Totally.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.876
You might wanna loosen your shoulders
and anchor your heels.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.712
There you go. You're a natural.

08:27.216 --> 08:31.637
That's Gali demanding his afternoon apple.
You okay? He can wait.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.097
You go ahead. I've got this.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.558
Okay. I'll be watching from the porch.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.481
You're doing great.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.525
Thanks.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.071
Major wants to get out of the ring.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.490
Is that okay? We'll be back in no time.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.868
Totally.
Sally and I will do a couple laps.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.954
-Get to know each other.
-Okay. Great.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.206
Come on.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.423
Whatever you do, Sally, please don't move.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.137
Rascal's really smart,

09:14.221 --> 09:17.057
but there's no way
I can train him by tomorrow.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.270
-Maybe you should get some help.
-I'm not calling Lizzie.

09:21.353 --> 09:25.357
I'm not talking about Lizzie. Here.
I brought this just in case.

09:25.858 --> 09:29.528
It's a doggy kindergarten.
The first class is free with this coupon.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.572
No!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.750
You been here the whole time?

09:44.334 --> 09:48.213
What? No. Am I in the same spot?

09:49.173 --> 09:50.883
What a crazy coincidence.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.095
Sally wants to go again. Are you ready?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.949
Hi, sweetie. Is everything all right?

10:16.033 --> 10:17.951
-Need me to come get you?
-No.

10:18.035 --> 10:21.413
-Everything is okay, kind of.
-You and Maria not getting along?

10:21.496 --> 10:25.501
No, I love Maria,
but horseback riding, not so much.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.712
Honey, she is your best friend.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.798
If you tell her how you feel,
I am sure she'll understand.

10:31.882 --> 10:32.883
Maybe.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.720
What if she doesn't?
I don't wanna ruin her birthday.

10:37.638 --> 10:38.597
Gotta go.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.308
Bracelet time!

10:43.268 --> 10:45.687
-Maria--
-This is the best birthday gift ever.

10:45.771 --> 10:49.608
Well, not the best.
The best is having you here.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.487
You know, I've been riding my whole life,

10:53.570 --> 10:56.949
but this is the first time
I've ever had someone to share it with.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.494
It's a classic BFF experience.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.498
-Bracelet time!
-Okay.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.804
Did you ever think you'd be back
in kindergarten again?

11:18.887 --> 11:21.932
They call it that because it sounds
better than "obedience school."

11:22.015 --> 11:25.227
We don't say "obedience."
We say "cooperation training."

11:26.103 --> 11:29.815
Now, class, let's get started.
Single file, dogs on your left.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.735
All right, nice brisk pace. Very good.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.655
-Come on, Rascal.
-There you go.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.115
Keep going.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.493
-Yes. See? This is-- Oh, no!
-Excellent.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.874
Rascal.

11:57.509 --> 12:01.555
-Stay! Stop! Rascal!
-I said stop! No! No! Rascal!

12:14.318 --> 12:17.112
Hey, Kathy,
check out the bracelet Lizzie made me.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.490
A horseshoe charm and half a heart.
The other half is on Lizzie's.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.578
That's very sweet. Major and Sally
are all tacked up and ready to go.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.496
-You two ready to ride?
-Yeah.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.208
I'll get us some carrots for the road.
Meet you out there.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.710
Actually, my leg is cramping up.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.003
I should go stretch it.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.466
-But you go ahead. I'll be fine.
-Are you sure?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.636
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
That's what we're here for, isn't it?

12:40.719 --> 12:42.346
Okay, thanks.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.937
I think you all know today is
a special day for a very special boy.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.982
It's my honor and pleasure
to present this diploma to Harley.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.069
All right. Okay.

12:57.152 --> 13:01.073
All right. There you go.

13:01.907 --> 13:02.908
No, no!

13:06.828 --> 13:07.829
Rascal!

13:09.164 --> 13:13.669
I'm so sorry. He's hard to control.
That's why we're here.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.756
I understand, but I'm afraid we can't have
Rascal back in a group class.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.300
Now, I do offer private sessions.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.594
Can I reuse the coupon?

13:22.678 --> 13:26.265
Sorry. Good luck with him. Bye, Rascal.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.850
You certainly are cute.

13:33.856 --> 13:37.317
-Maria's lucky to have such a good friend.
-We're both lucky.

13:40.571 --> 13:44.700
Gali's not so lucky. He hasn't bonded with
any of the other horses just yet.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.706
Poor guy.
Do you think that's why he's acting out?

13:50.789 --> 13:53.834
My guess is
he really doesn't wanna be here,

13:53.917 --> 13:56.795
and he's frustrated
because he doesn't know how to tell me.

14:05.846 --> 14:10.142
-I'm close! Come on. Close, close.
-No, to the left. No, no. Not--

14:11.727 --> 14:14.938
This is ridiculous.
There's gotta be a better way.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.524
If Lizzie were here,
she'd go straight to that shelf,

14:17.608 --> 14:20.611
pull out her book on terriers
and read everything about Jack Russells.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.447
No. I mean a better way to get the book.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.241
It may be a major violation
for you to go in there,

14:26.325 --> 14:29.203
but did she ever say
anything specifically about me?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.330
No.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.335
This one. Yes, got it!

14:38.545 --> 14:42.090
"Barton's Big Book of Breeds.
Volume 9. Terriers."

14:49.556 --> 14:52.226
Yep, we're trying
to figure you out, buddy.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.729
"Jack Russells were named
after the Reverend John Russell.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.856
They were bred in England
for fox hunting."

15:00.943 --> 15:04.363
"Mikey the Jack Russell
and his best friend, Sebastian the horse."

15:17.000 --> 15:20.587
We went to the pond and there was ducks,
and Major stopped to say hi to them.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.131
It was so sweet. Sorry you had to miss it.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.845
That's okay. I helped Kathy
get the hair out of the horses' brushes.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.346
So, also fun.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.230
-Is your leg feeling better?
-Yeah.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.316
Great. We've time for one more ride
before your parents get here.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.861
Then we can show them
how much you've learned.

15:44.361 --> 15:48.407
Maybe you can just show them?
You're better at it anyways.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.200
I can show them my grooming.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.953
Come on, Lizzie.
It's not about how good you are.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.789
-It's that you love doing it.
-Sounds good.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.875
Excellent. Let's go get Sally.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.711
Come on.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.428
-Wait! We're coming with you.
-Thought you were going to Sammy's.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.764
-We changed our minds.
-Sweetheart, we can't fit both of you.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.976
There won't be enough room
for Lizzie and Maria on the ride home.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.728
Here. You got this.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.565
All right. Bye, Rascal.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.109
-Bye.
-See you later, Sammy.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.236
You are never this eager
to see your sister.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.239
I'm guessing this is
part of your secret plan for Rascal?

16:29.323 --> 16:30.407
Sure is.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.577
-Okay. Let's go.
-Come on.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.162
Come on, Rascal.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.832
So remember: left foot in the stirrup,
and with your right hand--

16:38.916 --> 16:40.834
Maria, I have something to tell you.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.962
I don't wanna do this.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.548
What?

16:47.132 --> 16:48.133
I…

16:49.718 --> 16:53.555
I really don't like horseback riding.
Like, not at all.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.975
So this whole time you were--

16:57.059 --> 17:00.729
Pretending, which I guess is
just another way of saying

17:00.812 --> 17:03.440
that I wasn't being
completely honest with you.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.068
Here.

17:07.486 --> 17:11.073
You deserve a better best friend
who will always tell you the truth.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.824
Sorry.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.251
This is my fault.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.294
How is it your fault?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.549
Because I kinda had a feeling
you weren't that into it,

17:28.632 --> 17:31.343
but I wasn't positive,
so I pretended you were.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.683
If I hadn't been so obsessed with getting
you to like riding just because I do,

17:37.766 --> 17:40.435
you would've felt comfortable
telling me you hate it.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.523
I just wanted this weekend to be perfect.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.275
So did I.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.278
Can you maybe forgive me?

17:49.361 --> 17:52.322
Are you serious?
Of course I can forgive you.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.158
As long as you forgive me first.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.454
We're new to this best friend thing,
and we're still learning.

18:00.038 --> 18:04.209
And we're both really good students,
so we're gonna be fine.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.171
Did we just become
even better best friends?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.756
BBFFs with an extra B.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.758
Here.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.532
I hope your plan works.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.951
Survival of our living room furniture
depends on it.

18:38.035 --> 18:41.330
First, we get Lizzie and Maria to bring
the horses to one side of the fence.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.248
Then I'll bring Rascal to the other side.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.460
That way they'll see each other
but won't be able--

18:46.543 --> 18:48.170
Oh, no!

18:49.963 --> 18:51.006
Oh, no!

19:02.518 --> 19:04.019
-Rascal?
-Yep.

19:04.102 --> 19:08.315
I can't believe it. Sir Galahad is
the least friendly animal I've ever met.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.193
-He seems pretty friendly now.
-He sure does.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.125
She likes you.

19:27.209 --> 19:31.004
Yeah. I think I like her too.
A little bit.

19:32.923 --> 19:35.300
You have to come see this. Hurry!

19:35.384 --> 19:36.468
Okay.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.433
Oh, my goodness.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.727
That is one happy horse.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.563
And one exhausted puppy.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.734
You know,
Rascal is looking for a forever home.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.658
Looks to me like he's found one.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.161
Really? You're gonna take him?

20:03.245 --> 20:05.664
I don't think Gali would have it
any other way.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.171
You really came through for Rascal.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.381
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.757
-But you did.
-Sort of.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.177
If it wasn't for your book,
I never would've known

20:18.260 --> 20:20.929
how well Jack Russells
get along with horses.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.473
Wait, what book?

20:23.557 --> 20:25.976
The one on your shelf in the bedroom.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.980
-You went in my room?
-Technically, I didn't.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.108
Major violation. Major violation!
Charles, are you ser--

20:33.192 --> 20:36.028
I leave you alone for once.
Just one day and--
