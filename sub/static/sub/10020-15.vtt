00:06.881 --> 00:08.095
Previously on ER...

00:08.096 --> 00:09.782
You come here every day.

00:09.783 --> 00:12.306
Sometimes you're really cooking,
and sometimes you're not.

00:12.307 --> 00:14.314
- Alright, let's autotransfuse him.
- You're kidding.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.507
- He needs blood, Carter.
- And he's gonna get it.

00:16.708 --> 00:19.631
- Dad, I told you I'd rent a car.
- Your mother appreciates you coming.

00:19.632 --> 00:23.221
Oh, here you are! Oh, I'm so glad!

00:23.422 --> 00:24.510
- Jerry!
- What!

00:24.511 --> 00:25.991
Answer de damn phone!

00:25.992 --> 00:27.916
Did you withhold treatment
from that kid?

00:27.917 --> 00:28.917
It's my decision.

00:28.918 --> 00:30.934
It was good that
you stayed focused on the patient.

00:31.273 --> 00:33.231
- Thanks
- How much time do you need?

00:35.875 --> 00:37.569
I'll wait.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.875
"Exodus"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:33.655 --> 01:36.441
We pull into the ambulance bay
with a gunshot victim.

01:36.614 --> 01:37.729
What are you thinking?

01:37.906 --> 01:39.981
- Excuse me?
- A fresh trauma patient.

01:40.158 --> 01:41.485
What goes through your mind?

01:41.700 --> 01:44.023
The basics: Airway, breathing,
circulation.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.034
Yeah. But you docs don't think
about the scene.

01:47.243 --> 01:50.527
You see two IVs, c-collars,
backboards, monitors...

01:50.744 --> 01:54.324
...all packaged and ready to go. But
you don't know what we go through.

01:54.537 --> 01:56.030
Which is why I'm here.

01:56.204 --> 01:59.653
A one-day ride-along is not
gonna tell you the whole story.

01:59.873 --> 02:01.531
Sometimes we get shot at.

02:01.748 --> 02:05.613
Sometimes we're saving a banger,
and there's airmail coming at us.

02:05.791 --> 02:06.905
Airmail?

02:07.084 --> 02:11.160
Garbage, bottles, bricks. Thrown
from the windows, from the roof.

02:11.376 --> 02:13.996
And we're in the streets
trying to save a life.

02:14.211 --> 02:16.995
You gotta keep your mind right.
It can make you cynical.

02:17.212 --> 02:20.246
Well, let's hope we have an easy day.

02:20.462 --> 02:24.375
It usually is when you docs ride along.
That's why you don't get the big picture.

02:24.589 --> 02:29.414
You're here as an observer. We have
protocols, so don't go off on your own.

02:29.632 --> 02:31.209
Don't worry.

02:38.011 --> 02:40.417
Sure picked the right day
for your ride-along.

02:40.637 --> 02:43.172
- Where do we begin?
- Right here.

02:44.054 --> 02:45.962
- Come through here.
- What do you got?

02:46.180 --> 02:49.013
20 to 30 victims, mostly minor.
Lacerations, burns.

02:49.223 --> 02:51.379
One fatality.
We set up triage out there.

02:51.557 --> 02:54.888
We're all shored up.
I need to take a paramedic down.

02:55.099 --> 02:56.474
A guy's trapped under rubble.

02:57.225 --> 02:58.719
I'll go. I'm a trauma surgeon.

02:58.892 --> 03:00.386
County General, Dr. Corday.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.131
Have any experience
with confined-space rescue?

03:03.353 --> 03:05.723
No, but take me to him,
I'll see what I can do.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.845
Okay. Gear her up and take her down.

03:09.063 --> 03:13.271
First section's vertical, eight
to 10 feet. Better to go head first.

03:13.439 --> 03:16.107
- Head first?
- There's no room to turn around.

03:16.315 --> 03:20.606
The walls are pretty uneven so it's
easy to brace yourself with your hands.

03:20.817 --> 03:21.979
Do any rock climbing?

03:22.192 --> 03:24.479
No, I haven't.
Will I actually fit in there?

03:24.693 --> 03:27.147
It's tight at first
but opens up near the victim.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.688
You claustrophobic?

03:28.903 --> 03:30.064
No, not really.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.309
All right.

03:31.487 --> 03:34.688
Best you go first. If something
goes wrong I'll drag you out.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.566
Yeah. Okay, let's get on with it.

03:47.201 --> 03:49.358
- Okay.
- All right, it's not far now.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.776
Be careful, don't bump against
those four-by-fours.

03:54.953 --> 03:57.028
That's all that's holding
this place up.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.861
It's a little more open here.

04:01.622 --> 04:04.704
We jacked up as far as we can.
All this is pretty unstable.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.204
I can see him!

04:13.377 --> 04:14.538
We're on the way!

04:19.920 --> 04:22.670
Sir, are you okay?

04:22.879 --> 04:24.077
Get me out.

04:24.671 --> 04:25.869
It hurts.

04:26.089 --> 04:28.495
Yes, I'll give you something
for the pain.

04:28.715 --> 04:31.798
Then we're going to get you out, okay?

04:34.842 --> 04:35.956
Don't leave me.

04:36.426 --> 04:39.544
We won't.
We won't leave you, I promise.

04:42.011 --> 04:44.845
Give me the drug bag.
I need to start a line.

04:46.346 --> 04:48.302
It's okay, sir.

04:48.513 --> 04:50.708
If you just hang on.

06:03.787 --> 06:06.108
- Lilac.
- It's called "Spring Rain. "

06:06.285 --> 06:09.234
- It's nice.
- You think it's too young for me?

06:09.450 --> 06:12.232
No way. My mom wears
something just like that.

06:12.990 --> 06:16.731
I don't have time to sit down.
I'm on from 3 to 11.

06:16.903 --> 06:19.308
- How's it been going?
- Got busy after lunch.

06:19.526 --> 06:21.849
Doyle's out with the flu.
Heard from Mark?

06:22.067 --> 06:25.145
He's gonna try to catch a flight back
today or tomorrow.

06:25.355 --> 06:27.890
- One coffee, please.
- Sixty cents.

06:28.062 --> 06:29.720
Hey, Carter!

06:29.895 --> 06:31.516
How's the Optho rotation going?

06:31.727 --> 06:34.011
Only a week to go. Long week.

06:34.225 --> 06:37.386
Maybe you can help me out.
I've been getting headaches...

06:37.556 --> 06:39.711
...reviewing these financial reports.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.884
I need a new pair of reading glasses.

06:42.095 --> 06:44.250
Sure, come on up. I'll check you out.

06:44.469 --> 06:46.836
- Get you a new prescription.
- Thank you.

06:47.217 --> 06:48.376
You can keep that.

06:48.549 --> 06:51.912
Jack Arteburn, 52.
Fainted at a breakfast meeting.

06:52.130 --> 06:55.540
A and O on arrival, vitals normal.
Started a line for kicks.

06:55.711 --> 06:57.285
Did you have any chest pain?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.537
No, I was just a little dizzy.

06:59.707 --> 07:01.947
My secretary overreacted.

07:02.165 --> 07:04.569
- Are you a doctor?
- I'm a physician assistant.

07:04.788 --> 07:07.157
But I'll be seeing a real doctor?

07:07.370 --> 07:11.609
County dispatch says there's been
an explosion at a chemical warehouse.

07:11.825 --> 07:14.063
They want to send us six minors
with burns.

07:14.281 --> 07:16.187
- Yeah, no problem.
- No problem.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.401
Just a little bee sting, Leo.

07:19.652 --> 07:23.146
Sorry. It's the only place
to put an IV.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.436
Get me out of here!

07:24.650 --> 07:26.438
Yep. We're working on that.

07:26.648 --> 07:30.591
Hang on. I'll give you some morphine.
Make you feel much better.

07:30.812 --> 07:33.808
Dewey, can you lift up the saline?

07:44.719 --> 07:45.998
He's got a good pulse.

07:46.219 --> 07:48.788
Some broken ribs,
and he can wriggle his toes.

07:49.009 --> 07:52.207
I can't assess the right arm.
It's pinned at his shoulder.

07:52.423 --> 07:55.169
If we could raise the concrete
just another inch or two.

07:55.338 --> 07:57.658
No. Any movement could bring
all this down.

07:57.836 --> 08:01.613
Just an inch, then we might free it.
And I won't have to amputate.

08:01.833 --> 08:04.698
No! No, please don't cut off my arm.

08:04.913 --> 08:09.652
No. We're trying to save it, Leo.
We're gonna lift up that slab.

08:09.828 --> 08:11.947
What else can we do if
we're to get him out?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.271
Okay.

08:14.367 --> 08:17.279
I'm gonna need more shoring
before we try anything.

08:17.489 --> 08:18.767
I need a bone saw.

08:18.987 --> 08:20.729
No. Don't do it, please.

08:20.946 --> 08:23.230
Only as a last resort, Leo.

08:23.943 --> 08:26.098
What about something to
reduce the friction?

08:26.275 --> 08:27.303
Grease?

08:27.482 --> 08:32.433
No, it's too thick. We need something
we can pour, like vegetable oil.

08:32.688 --> 08:35.054
- We got motor oil.
- Yeah. Motor oil.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.340
Lots of it.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.217
We'll get you slick as an eel
and slide you out.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.965
E- L-M.

08:43.179 --> 08:46.046
N- E.

08:46.262 --> 08:49.873
Very good. Very good, Mrs. Melenger.

08:50.883 --> 08:52.127
Okay.

08:52.466 --> 08:56.919
Now I want you to tell me
which one is clearer, okay?

08:57.129 --> 08:58.869
Number one...

09:00.960 --> 09:02.202
...or number two?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.790
Number two is very dark.

09:04.499 --> 09:07.032
Okay, let's try that again.
Number one...

09:08.330 --> 09:09.526
...or number two?

09:10.120 --> 09:13.116
It's black. I can't see through that.

09:14.326 --> 09:17.606
Yes. I think that is probably
a little too much tint for you.

09:18.281 --> 09:19.311
Is everything okay?

09:19.531 --> 09:22.396
Not really. I think your student
needs some help.

09:22.612 --> 09:24.601
Why don't I finish up here, Dr. Carter?

09:25.276 --> 09:26.556
There's...

09:27.358 --> 09:30.603
...a glaucoma patient in the ER.
Needs a consult.

09:30.815 --> 09:33.266
Glenn Krakowski, 32, from
the chemical warehouse.

09:33.479 --> 09:36.511
Right tib-fib fracture.
Complaining of abdominal pain.

09:36.728 --> 09:40.305
BP 132/75. Pulse 92.
IV's in the field.

09:40.517 --> 09:41.713
What about these guys?

09:41.932 --> 09:43.804
Minor burns and lacerations
from glass.

09:44.014 --> 09:46.548
- Anything for me?
- Blood trauma, abdominal pain.

09:46.721 --> 09:49.422
- Is T-1 open?
- Yeah. Start on him. I'll take the others.

09:49.635 --> 09:53.757
- Sir, are you on any medication?
- No, nothing. I never get sick.

09:54.257 --> 09:57.040
Message from Dr. Anspaugh.
He's giving a lecture.

09:57.214 --> 10:00.163
- That's the hotel phone number.
- Is that Mr. Arteburn's chart?

10:00.378 --> 10:02.700
Yeah, yeah. Actually, check this out.

10:02.918 --> 10:04.079
Blue Cross.

10:04.292 --> 10:08.781
Not the HMO, not the PPO.
Traditional indemnity plan, gold.

10:08.956 --> 10:12.614
- Jerry, we treat everyone the same.
- I'm thinking about the budget deficit.

10:12.828 --> 10:16.274
Mr. Arteburn, I have some preliminary
results and I'd like to-

10:16.450 --> 10:20.443
If there's any cause for concern,
I'd rather go see my own doctor.

10:20.657 --> 10:24.943
Changes in your EKG suggest that you
may have had a small heart attack.

10:25.153 --> 10:27.226
- Heart attack?
- We'll check a blood test...

10:27.444 --> 10:30.474
...to make sure there was no
heart muscle damage.

10:30.691 --> 10:33.356
If that's normal, we'll do
a treadmill heart scan.

10:33.565 --> 10:36.892
Would you call my doctor,
Greg Fonarow? He's up on Chestnut.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.093
I want his opinion on
what you're doing.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.472
I'll call him when I get
the test results.

10:41.684 --> 10:45.426
Don't worry. You'll find we give
the highest standard of care.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.592
It's your last quart, Leo.

10:50.761 --> 10:52.632
I raised it an inch. That's it.

10:53.426 --> 10:54.587
Right.

10:56.591 --> 10:57.751
You ready?

10:57.964 --> 10:59.871
One, two, three!

11:03.585 --> 11:05.208
Let me check his arm.

11:05.418 --> 11:06.957
- You got room?
- Yep.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.659
You said you wouldn't amputate.

11:08.875 --> 11:13.410
It won't come to that. Another good
tug and we'll get you out of the hole.

11:14.121 --> 11:15.825
- You ready?
- Yeah.

11:16.536 --> 11:18.359
Then pull!

11:20.574 --> 11:22.564
We don't have enough leverage
to lift him out.

11:22.781 --> 11:24.736
- I need a come-along.
- What's that?

11:24.947 --> 11:26.521
It's a kind of winch-

11:38.395 --> 11:40.550
- What was that?
- I don't know.

11:43.059 --> 11:45.214
Dewey here.
What the hell's going on?

11:46.057 --> 11:49.835
Explosion in the chemical area.
Abort and get out.

11:50.055 --> 11:52.091
Acknowledged. Cap says out.

11:52.303 --> 11:54.706
No. Tell them to bring what
we need so we can get him out!

11:54.926 --> 11:56.383
He won't let anyone come down.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.416
- Then you go get it.
- And leave you?

11:58.632 --> 12:01.249
Yes. They've gotta let you back
down if I'm here.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.453
Now go! I'm not leaving him!

12:04.920 --> 12:07.702
- But hurry!
- Okay. I'll be back.

12:16.495 --> 12:18.615
We're gonna die down here.

12:18.827 --> 12:20.235
It's okay, Leo.

12:20.451 --> 12:24.193
Just one more piece of equipment
and we'll get you out.

12:26.697 --> 12:30.688
I've got an 8-year-old with
altered mental status, short of breath.

12:30.861 --> 12:33.015
Babysitter called 911.

12:34.691 --> 12:37.889
- I stopped by this morning.
- I had an early morning meeting.

12:38.106 --> 12:39.763
Before 7:00?

12:39.979 --> 12:41.436
Are you monitoring me?

12:41.645 --> 12:43.516
Just offering you a ride.

12:44.393 --> 12:46.596
Sophie? This is Dr. Ross.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.596
- Hi, Sophie.
- Hi.

12:50.098 --> 12:51.258
How long's she been sick?

12:51.472 --> 12:54.337
Her mom said she's had diarrhea
for a couple days now.

12:54.677 --> 12:58.337
She said to give her a spoonful
of bee pollen and raspberry tea.

12:58.509 --> 12:59.835
How are you feeling, Sophie?

13:00.007 --> 13:04.165
- I have to practice the piano.
- She's altered. When did that start?

13:04.671 --> 13:08.165
I found her on the floor. She had
a bowel movement with blood in it.

13:08.377 --> 13:09.952
I couldn't wake her up.

13:10.168 --> 13:12.868
Give her an ABG, a CBC,
a chem 20 and a chest x-ray.

13:13.082 --> 13:14.455
Want an IV of saline?

13:14.664 --> 13:16.121
No, just a HEP block.

13:16.331 --> 13:18.154
She's gonna be all right?

13:18.579 --> 13:20.982
- Did you talk to her parents?
- I beeped her mom.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.321
Could you try again?

13:22.867 --> 13:24.028
Yeah.

13:28.280 --> 13:33.183
If you'd gone to public school, you
could've seen my science program.

13:33.527 --> 13:35.398
I started them right after the war.

13:35.609 --> 13:37.314
Try and keep your eyes still.

13:37.524 --> 13:38.850
Look at my earlobe.

13:39.065 --> 13:43.518
You know, about 1950,
I was on a TV program.

13:43.729 --> 13:47.968
I liked it so much I wanted
to make it my life's work.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.296
What happened?

13:49.474 --> 13:51.464
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

13:51.681 --> 13:56.631
That son of a bitch, Mr. Wizard, came
along and left me dead in the water.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.211
Yeah. Go ahead, laugh.

14:01.134 --> 14:02.294
Well, it looks good.

14:02.507 --> 14:06.369
I'm gonna need to check your eye
pressure with a tono-pen, Mr. Bikel.

14:06.588 --> 14:08.742
- Dr. George.
- Dr. George?

14:08.961 --> 14:10.702
Tono-pen?

14:10.918 --> 14:14.780
The state-of-the-art we used to get
was the big one with the air puff.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.746
I'll put numbing drops in
and then measure the pressure.

14:17.956 --> 14:20.074
Solid-state microcircuitry.

14:20.287 --> 14:23.153
But all in all, just a simple
pressure transducer.

14:23.369 --> 14:24.564
That's what-

14:28.073 --> 14:31.069
That's numbing already.
The numbing's coming fast.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.442
Press this button and it works.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.068
Don't you wanna know how?

14:35.902 --> 14:40.437
I could build you one. Out of an ink jar,
finger cot and a swizzle stick.

14:42.355 --> 14:43.552
All right.

14:45.645 --> 14:47.800
Thirty-five. Your pressure's up a bit.

14:49.267 --> 14:52.880
It doesn't look good.
Creatinine's 6.8. Potassium's 7.3.

14:53.098 --> 14:56.461
She's got acute renal failure. Get me
glucose, insulin, and Kayexalate.

14:56.679 --> 14:58.835
What's shutting down her kidneys?

14:59.052 --> 15:03.174
It could be bloody diarrhea. E. coli,
probably. Push two of Versed.

15:03.383 --> 15:05.040
Get an ET tube 6.5.

15:05.257 --> 15:07.957
That's good. She needs
a central line for dialysis.

15:08.172 --> 15:10.208
Call for a pediatric nephrology consult.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.078
When can I go home?

15:12.294 --> 15:13.572
Not for a little while.

15:13.793 --> 15:17.120
Dr. Ross will give you some medicine
that will make you very sleepy.

15:17.290 --> 15:20.654
When you wake up, you'll have a tube
in your mouth to help you breathe.

15:20.872 --> 15:23.654
You won't be able to speak,
so we'll do hand signals.

15:23.869 --> 15:25.444
Do you know what this means?

15:25.618 --> 15:26.648
Okay?

15:26.868 --> 15:28.691
Good. Are you good at charades?

15:28.908 --> 15:30.647
Here we go. Hold on.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.274
Crike, crike, crike.

15:33.488 --> 15:35.359
Honey? What's going on?

15:35.612 --> 15:37.187
All right. Hang on.

15:37.361 --> 15:40.854
I'm in, bag her. Are you the mother?
Get me an 11 French catheter.

15:41.025 --> 15:43.097
Sophie? Sophie?

15:43.315 --> 15:44.687
Why is she unconscious?

15:44.897 --> 15:48.556
We had to sedate her to get
the breathing tube down her throat.

15:48.769 --> 15:51.221
She wasn't sick when I left.
She had some diarrhea.

15:51.393 --> 15:54.507
We believe it's an E. coli infection
causing the kidney failure.

15:54.724 --> 15:58.963
E. coli? That comes from meat.
It's impossible, she doesn't eat meat.

15:59.137 --> 16:01.210
It can also come from
raw juices or sprouts.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.915
Well, however she got it,
she needs dialysis.

16:04.135 --> 16:07.544
Oh, no. I want another opinion before
you put her on some machine.

16:07.715 --> 16:08.744
There's no time.

16:08.922 --> 16:12.002
This is my daughter. I have a right
to decide how she's treated.

16:12.212 --> 16:15.704
Her high potassium could cause
a cardiac arrest. She needs dialysis.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.541
If she doesn't get it, she'll die.
Sign the consent.

16:18.707 --> 16:20.200
Please?

16:23.871 --> 16:25.492
No. My leg! I'm caught!

16:25.703 --> 16:28.368
His foot's caught.
I'm gonna try and free it.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.399
Can you reach it? Can you loosen it?

16:36.154 --> 16:38.985
- What are you doing?
- Just a tiny bit.

16:39.194 --> 16:41.894
The shoring's down! Get out!

16:46.564 --> 16:48.056
He's free!

16:48.271 --> 16:49.846
Pull! Pull!

16:52.934 --> 16:57.836
Pull! Pull! Pull!

17:06.935 --> 17:07.965
How are you doing?

17:08.144 --> 17:10.896
Last one. See you tomorrow
for a wound check.

17:11.189 --> 17:15.980
Make sure you call the employee-health
coordinator at the chemical plant.

17:16.194 --> 17:18.067
- Fax them all-
- I need some help!

17:18.279 --> 17:20.486
- What happened?
- We're from Prusack Chemco.

17:20.698 --> 17:25.159
We were behind Building 5 when the
tank blew. Manny went into the stuff.

17:25.368 --> 17:28.737
- What kind of stuff?
- Everyone got soaked. It was a mess.

17:28.955 --> 17:31.411
I threw these guys in
back of my pickup.

17:31.625 --> 17:32.787
What is that smell?

17:33.001 --> 17:35.207
Solvent. Everyone got sick.

17:35.419 --> 17:36.962
Jeanie, take the other guys.

17:37.171 --> 17:39.627
Bag and seal the clothes.
Glove up, everybody.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.957
I'm gonna open some doors.

17:42.217 --> 17:45.004
I want you to use one drop,
three times a day.

17:45.220 --> 17:48.423
Three times a day, one drop.
Thank you.

17:50.642 --> 17:52.184
What's the matter?

17:52.394 --> 17:54.221
- Benzene.
- What?

17:54.436 --> 17:56.346
It's benzene. Don't you smell it?

17:57.273 --> 17:59.016
Probably just stripping the floors.

17:59.233 --> 18:02.684
Stripping floors with benzene?
I don't think so.

18:02.903 --> 18:05.275
It's much too toxic.

18:06.865 --> 18:08.442
Doctor, before I go...

18:08.659 --> 18:12.524
...find out where that smell is
coming from as quick as possible.

18:14.915 --> 18:17.286
Set up oxygen.
Pulse is weak and thready.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.208
Bilateral wheezes.

18:19.418 --> 18:21.541
- What's going on?
- Chemical spill.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.042
Yosh, bag these clothes up
and get them outside.

18:24.256 --> 18:27.505
Take slow, deep breaths.
You want me to call your wife?

18:27.676 --> 18:30.712
- You might be here a while.
- We need fans. I'll call Maintenance.

18:30.929 --> 18:33.383
Get Housekeeping to clean up-

18:34.473 --> 18:36.132
- Give me a hand!
- Oh, my God! Wait!

18:36.308 --> 18:37.968
No one touch her without gloves on.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.886
Her clothes are soaked through.
Ready? One, two, three!

18:42.105 --> 18:44.477
- Get a mask on her!
- Pulse ox.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.354
Roll her on her side.

18:48.570 --> 18:50.727
- Don't let her aspirate!
- Suction.

18:51.406 --> 18:53.943
Ativan, two milligrams IV, now!

18:57.370 --> 18:59.029
- She needs a line.
- It's Dr. Weaver!

18:59.205 --> 19:00.746
Don't walk there. It's benzene.

19:00.914 --> 19:01.946
What is that?

19:02.123 --> 19:03.701
It's a solvent. It's toxic.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.494
We don't want to spread this stuff
around. Keep it contained.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.920
- Let's go with the Ativan.
- Need to intubate.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.045
When we give an order,
it's for a reason!

19:17.263 --> 19:19.800
- I'm sorry. But we were so close.
- You could've died!

19:19.974 --> 19:22.809
- I'd have three deaths to explain!
- I was worried about you!

19:22.976 --> 19:25.384
Leo Leipziger. Crush injury
to the right arm.

19:25.604 --> 19:28.059
BP 90 palp. Pulse 110.

19:28.273 --> 19:30.894
- We had a prolonged extrication.
- No kidding!

19:31.108 --> 19:34.691
Stay to the right. We've got an
unknown solvent leaking from a tank.

19:34.903 --> 19:37.027
HazMat's setting up
for decontamination.

19:38.865 --> 19:41.321
Chuny, we need more of these to
cover the floor.

19:41.535 --> 19:42.698
I'll call Central. Here.

19:42.911 --> 19:46.493
Anna, check Ellenhorn's Toxicology
and find out about benzene exposure.

19:46.706 --> 19:47.951
Where to?

19:48.167 --> 19:51.251
Trauma 1. Move the sickest
patients away from here.

19:51.461 --> 19:53.619
Double-bag all of
the contaminated clothes.

19:53.796 --> 19:57.379
Get the clean patients to the back.
Randi, grab their charts now!

19:57.550 --> 19:59.875
You need to air this place.
Did you call HazMat?

20:00.052 --> 20:03.172
- They're on the way.
- There's another one in the closet.

20:03.387 --> 20:05.796
We'll blow it out of here in no time.

20:06.223 --> 20:09.307
No, no, no! Don't plug that in!
Sparks might ignite the fumes.

20:09.477 --> 20:11.137
- Great.
- Jerry, give me a phone!

20:11.354 --> 20:13.145
What's the ETA on HazMat?

20:13.314 --> 20:15.187
You gotta find that disaster manual.

20:15.358 --> 20:18.891
I need surgical drapes, waterproof
ones. Better send a dozen.

20:19.111 --> 20:22.729
- Dispatch, this is County General ER.
- They'll be here in five!

20:22.948 --> 20:25.273
This is an emergency!
Send the drapes up now!

20:25.450 --> 20:26.695
I need oxygen.

20:26.868 --> 20:30.201
We're closing down to all paramedic-
No, immediately!

20:31.540 --> 20:32.570
Hang in there, Leo.

20:32.790 --> 20:34.451
Trauma patient. What's going on?

20:34.624 --> 20:37.033
Benzene fumes are
contaminating patients.

20:37.253 --> 20:39.080
Dr. Corday, we're moving
everybody out.

20:39.296 --> 20:44.005
He needs x-rays, peritoneal lavage
and immediate surgery on his arm.

20:44.217 --> 20:46.256
Take him to the back hall.
I'll call X-ray.

20:46.468 --> 20:47.501
In the hall?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.929
- Prep that guy and notify the OR.
- You got it.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.058
Where are you taking me?
What are we doing in the hall?

20:54.893 --> 20:57.514
Get out of here! Fumes are
coming off the gurney!

20:57.687 --> 20:58.969
I want to get out of here!

20:59.147 --> 21:01.140
- What happened to Randi?
- She's fainted.

21:01.316 --> 21:03.807
- The lobby?
- Let's go! Clean patients only!

21:04.027 --> 21:05.687
How do we know who's clean?

21:05.902 --> 21:08.987
- Is Randi contaminated?
- If it's on her clothes.

21:09.156 --> 21:12.026
- You okay?
- Fine, but my patient's critical.

21:12.910 --> 21:17.122
If the CEO's in a meeting, get me her
assistant. I'm in disaster mode.

21:18.165 --> 21:20.323
Three victims from the blast.
Decontaminated.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.074
- What's this?
- You can't come in. ER's contaminated.

21:23.252 --> 21:25.411
- What happened?
- They came covered in benzene.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.086
- Clear the lobby!
- You shouldn't have let them in!

21:28.257 --> 21:30.334
You didn't control it!
They came in a truck!

21:30.593 --> 21:32.420
Move this gurney out of the way!

21:32.636 --> 21:34.712
Move! Just move!

21:35.598 --> 21:37.838
Somebody clear out the lobby!

21:44.564 --> 21:46.770
Send them to Mercy or something!

21:47.274 --> 21:49.017
All right, everybody shut up!

21:49.234 --> 21:51.109
- Everybody shut up!
- Send them to Mercy!

21:51.320 --> 21:54.819
We' re going to evacuate the entire ER!
Check every room.

21:55.032 --> 21:58.899
All contaminated patients and staff go
to the ambulance bay right now!

21:59.119 --> 22:00.529
How do we know who's contaminated?

22:00.746 --> 22:04.197
If you got a spot on your skin,
your gurney, or your clothes...

22:04.415 --> 22:05.577
...go outside right now!

22:05.791 --> 22:07.334
Move, move!
Let's get him out.

22:08.003 --> 22:09.033
Let's get her out.

22:09.253 --> 22:13.167
- Dr. Weaver, how you doing?
- Her seizing stopped. She's postictal.

22:13.382 --> 22:15.209
I won't go outside without my jacket!

22:15.425 --> 22:17.418
Can you get some blankets for them?

22:17.594 --> 22:19.918
Send home any non-urgent cases now.

22:20.096 --> 22:23.180
If you need stitches or x-rays,
go to the lobby!

22:23.809 --> 22:25.516
Let me have this for a second.

22:25.726 --> 22:27.102
How many critical are there?

22:27.270 --> 22:29.392
I got three here in the ambulance bay!

22:29.605 --> 22:33.223
Seven, eight.
There's three outside. That's 11.

22:33.776 --> 22:36.612
All critical patients should move to...

22:38.905 --> 22:41.028
Go to the cafeteria.
It's big enough.

22:41.241 --> 22:44.942
Let's stock it with portable monitors
and oxygen cylinders.

22:45.119 --> 22:47.277
That's where we're moving. Let's go!

22:47.497 --> 22:49.739
It's not good to move during dialysis.

22:49.957 --> 22:51.699
Can this thing run off a battery?

22:51.917 --> 22:55.452
- No battery. There's a hand crank.
- Then start cranking.

22:55.629 --> 22:57.039
Pedes Unit has a bed.

22:57.255 --> 22:59.130
All right. Get her ready.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.592
Joint Admission Protocols,
Quality Assessment and Improvements.

23:03.803 --> 23:06.091
What are you doing?
I need Ellenhorn.

23:06.305 --> 23:10.600
Check under the stack. The disaster
manual has gotta be here somewhere.

23:11.309 --> 23:13.303
- What does it say?
- I just found it.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.516
What about Policy and Procedures?
Maybe something in here-

23:16.731 --> 23:21.025
Forget it. Grab all the charts and
take them to Benton in the cafeteria.

23:21.235 --> 23:23.643
- I'm sure there's probably-
- Run to the cafeteria!

23:23.862 --> 23:27.563
It's under Hydrocarbons. "Excreted
in urine as sulfate conjugates-"

23:27.784 --> 23:30.072
No, not that.
Go to Clinical Presentation.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.317
Pulmonary System.

23:31.495 --> 23:34.531
"Coughing, choking, pulmonary edema
where aspiration occurs. "

23:34.748 --> 23:36.740
I think Manny aspirated,
but not Weaver.

23:36.958 --> 23:40.078
Central Nervous System.
"Inhalation causes depression...

23:40.294 --> 23:42.536
...and rarely, seizures from hypoxia. "

23:42.756 --> 23:44.747
Supportive Care.
"Treat with oxygen. "

23:44.966 --> 23:47.338
- That's what we're doing.
- She should be okay.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.800
Let's move this table
up against the wall. Let's go!

23:53.015 --> 23:55.340
- You're scratching my floor!
- You, help him.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.352
- Don't order my people around!
- Where are the outlets?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.056
Along that wall and that wall.

24:00.271 --> 24:02.347
All right, everybody, listen up!

24:02.522 --> 24:06.141
When I call the patient's name,
give me the diagnosis. Arteburn?

24:06.360 --> 24:07.819
Right here. Rule out Ml.

24:08.028 --> 24:10.353
Let's get him over here.
Center aisle.

24:10.531 --> 24:12.487
- Nguyen?
- Shock, respiratory failure.

24:12.658 --> 24:14.365
Against the wall. He'll need a vent.

24:14.576 --> 24:15.774
Where are you going?

24:15.994 --> 24:19.362
I can't wait. I need to get him
cleaned and up to the OR.

24:19.539 --> 24:20.618
Williams!

24:22.040 --> 24:24.164
We gotta get some heat.
We're gonna freeze.

24:24.335 --> 24:25.366
HazMat. What's up?

24:25.585 --> 24:27.992
There's a benzene spill.
Patients are contaminated.

24:28.171 --> 24:31.006
- We need some shelter.
- We'll set them up out here.

24:33.177 --> 24:36.379
Take these to the cafeteria
and set up a portable suction.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.972
- Where's the spill?
- On the other side. We're evacuating.

24:41.184 --> 24:43.306
- That means you too, Dr...?
- Carter.

24:43.519 --> 24:45.725
Captain Dannaker.
We're setting up a decon.

24:45.938 --> 24:49.223
We're stocking the ambulance bay
and cafeteria with supplies.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.808
We'll get you what you need.
Get everyone out now.

24:51.984 --> 24:55.354
You won't know what to look for.
Give me five minutes.

24:55.571 --> 24:57.445
- You got two!
- Okay!

24:58.033 --> 25:01.236
Grab a crash cart, defibrillator
and a bunch of mayo stands.

25:01.453 --> 25:02.697
- Right!
- You guys okay?

25:02.912 --> 25:04.904
- We're on our way.
- Okay.

25:07.416 --> 25:11.364
Chuny, get a lot of saline. Lots of it.
Anybody in Exam 4?

25:11.586 --> 25:13.045
I need you down here.

25:13.253 --> 25:18.082
Inga Paulson, coronary artery disease,
dopamine drip. Help me move her out.

25:18.259 --> 25:20.880
I'll do it. You take ACLS
drugs to the cafeteria.

25:21.095 --> 25:22.968
Grab a big cart and load it full.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.465
- You're gonna move her and bag her?
- Yeah. Go, go, go!

25:27.267 --> 25:29.592
Don't worry, Inga.
We'll get you out of here.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.897
This is ridiculous! It won't work.
There's no room.

25:33.107 --> 25:34.564
We should go to the cafeteria.

25:34.733 --> 25:38.895
No, I need her in the ICU.
Stop cranking, I'll disconnect.

25:39.111 --> 25:41.862
- Her blood's in that machine.
- I'm aware of that.

25:42.072 --> 25:45.072
- We should go to the cafeteria now.
- Hang on.

25:45.242 --> 25:47.732
All right. Now we got a loop.

25:47.911 --> 25:49.655
Start cranking and come with me.

25:49.872 --> 25:52.541
Take the other elevator
and meet us at PICU.

25:52.749 --> 25:54.077
Don't let that blood clot!

25:56.252 --> 25:59.585
Good, Inga. Big squeeze
every three seconds.

25:59.963 --> 26:01.422
Doing fine.

26:01.632 --> 26:02.877
This is the last one.

26:03.091 --> 26:04.290
Get moving.

26:04.634 --> 26:07.008
- What the hell?
- A fire alarm. I'll get it.

26:07.221 --> 26:09.842
Dannaker here.
Get me the fire control room.

26:10.265 --> 26:11.890
What's that?

26:12.767 --> 26:14.760
Fire alarm. Hang on.

26:18.273 --> 26:21.060
I lost the bag!
Can you stabilize the tube?

26:22.275 --> 26:24.945
- What did you push?
- Nothing. I-

26:25.946 --> 26:27.356
What the hell's going on?

26:27.573 --> 26:30.941
Elevator recall, down to the lobby.
Happens during emergencies.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.535
Sophie, you okay?

26:36.914 --> 26:39.950
- Why have we stopped?
- I don't know. How's her oxygen?

26:40.627 --> 26:44.539
She's got two-thirds of a tank.
20 minutes left.

26:44.754 --> 26:45.870
Look at that!

26:50.051 --> 26:54.677
- Think they'll hear that?
- Yeah, they'll hear it.

27:14.697 --> 27:17.104
- Excuse me. You're a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

27:17.283 --> 27:20.365
My daughter's a patient in the ER.
They won't let me in.

27:20.576 --> 27:23.067
- Okay.
- You can't be here, ma'am.

27:23.286 --> 27:24.531
No! Somebody help me!

27:24.746 --> 27:27.118
- Check in the cafeteria.
- Let go of me!

27:27.289 --> 27:30.455
- Captain Dannaker?
- Copy. No fire verified on floor two.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.333
Fire patrol, do a reset.

27:32.543 --> 27:35.959
False alarm. Somebody smelled
fumes and panicked.

27:36.838 --> 27:40.171
- Jeanie, why are we outside?
- We're taking you to the cafeteria.

27:40.382 --> 27:42.209
- Is she okay?
- She's still altered.

27:42.426 --> 27:45.629
It's not the benzene, it's
the seizures. She should be fine.

27:47.388 --> 27:49.628
Some may need attention
before they go inside.

27:49.806 --> 27:51.514
- You're in the cold zone.
- Cold zone?

27:51.724 --> 27:55.590
Out here. In there's the warm zone.
Nobody goes in there without a suit.

27:55.810 --> 27:57.802
Same goes for the ER, it's a hot zone.

27:57.979 --> 27:59.057
- Are you Carter?
- Yeah.

27:59.230 --> 28:02.432
Harriet Spooner, VP of Operations.
I'm the incident commander.

28:02.649 --> 28:05.649
- Did you evacuate to the cafeteria?
- Yeah.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.652
The disaster plan calls for evacuation
to Physical Therapy.

28:08.818 --> 28:10.896
It got chaotic. We had to improvise.

28:11.114 --> 28:12.738
We have an elevator stuck.

28:12.907 --> 28:14.731
- I'll get the engineer.
- Anybody on it?

28:14.949 --> 28:17.735
Don't know. The phone's dead
and the alarm's going off.

28:20.203 --> 28:22.659
Just keep your eye on it.
Now listen, Sophie?

28:22.830 --> 28:27.158
We're going on a little adventure.
You'll have cool stories to tell.

28:27.334 --> 28:29.124
Multifocal PVCs.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.659
Let me see this. Potassium's too high.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.662
Push an amp of bicarb.
Buy us a little time.

28:37.007 --> 28:41.133
Run of seven. Here, take it.
Bicarb. She'll go into V-tach.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.802
We don't have any.

28:43.011 --> 28:45.051
Did you check the box?
You can't...

28:45.263 --> 28:48.098
...treat hyperkaliemia without bicarb.

28:48.307 --> 28:51.178
It wasn't my idea
to move her like this.

28:53.268 --> 28:55.841
- It's okay. It's okay, Sophie.
- What do you have?

28:56.063 --> 28:59.182
All right. We got epi, atropine.
How about lidocaine?

28:59.399 --> 29:00.560
I'll take lidocaine.

29:01.399 --> 29:04.565
50 mg bolus,
and 5 every five minutes.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.104
How's the oxygen?

29:06.570 --> 29:08.028
Ten minutes.

29:10.032 --> 29:11.194
You'll be fine.

29:11.406 --> 29:13.530
Lavage is negative.
Let's get him to the OR.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.776
Hey, Transport! Give us a hand.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.576
Dr. Weaver?

29:23.999 --> 29:25.329
I'm sorry. Have we met?

29:26.543 --> 29:27.741
You're my doctor.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.828
We should let her rest.

29:30.421 --> 29:33.539
We got two more vents coming down.
Who gets the first one?

29:34.172 --> 29:35.881
Let's start with Inga.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.917
Are you sure, Inga?
It could be awhile.

29:39.094 --> 29:40.801
Carter, where's your Attending?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.127
Dr. Weaver's over here.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.338
- Do you need more nurses?
- Yes, we do.

29:44.557 --> 29:46.964
All right. I can float you
three from the ICU.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.879
Kerry?

29:49.101 --> 29:51.592
Harriet. What is going on?

29:51.811 --> 29:55.679
I am so sorry. I had no idea you
were debilitated by the incident.

29:55.856 --> 29:56.887
What incident?

29:57.107 --> 29:59.264
Remember I told you there
was a toxic spill?

29:59.442 --> 30:00.473
Will she be all right?

30:00.692 --> 30:04.559
Lack of oxygen caused a seizure.
We don't expect any long-term effects.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.530
This is the action packet
for the chief medical officer...

30:07.699 --> 30:09.856
...which I guess,
for the moment, is you.

30:10.075 --> 30:13.028
Here's a walkie. I'll check in
with you in half an hour.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.952
I've got to deal with the elevator.

30:15.120 --> 30:19.034
- Did you get them out?
- Repairman's on the way. It'll be an hour.

30:20.039 --> 30:21.700
- There are two sets of doors?
- Yeah.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.621
- Help me when I open it.
- I can't. I gotta bag her.

30:24.836 --> 30:26.709
Reach in! Get your body in here.

30:26.921 --> 30:29.494
- Right there.
- All right.

30:29.714 --> 30:31.256
- Watch your knee. Go.
- I got it.

30:31.423 --> 30:35.207
Hang on. We're two and a half
feet short of the floor.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.632
There's gotta be a latch.

30:38.805 --> 30:40.297
Come down. What if it moves?

30:40.472 --> 30:42.263
No worries about commitment.

30:42.473 --> 30:45.093
- I'm serious.
- I got it. Right there.

30:45.309 --> 30:47.799
Pull it. Give me another pull.

30:48.812 --> 30:49.891
What's that?

30:50.104 --> 30:52.309
It's not the EKG. It's her pulse ox.

30:52.522 --> 30:54.479
The 02 sat's down to 89.

30:54.649 --> 30:56.806
Oh, God! Sophie?! Sophie?

30:57.025 --> 30:59.860
- All right, I got it.
- She's unresponsive!

31:00.152 --> 31:03.153
- Anybody in there?
- We got a little girl in here!

31:03.322 --> 31:04.485
Got that?

31:04.657 --> 31:06.695
Hold that there.
We need oxygen!

31:06.908 --> 31:09.613
- Get us out of here!
- We don't have time! Let's go!

31:15.122 --> 31:17.197
It won't go any
further than that!

31:17.416 --> 31:19.823
Come on! It's gonna work.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.039
Watch your fingers. Hang on.

31:22.253 --> 31:23.497
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:23.670 --> 31:24.832
Okay, hang on.

31:25.046 --> 31:27.003
Hold it right there. Try this.

31:29.424 --> 31:30.455
All right.

31:30.674 --> 31:32.881
- It's not gonna open.
- It's gonna open!

31:33.552 --> 31:36.337
- Come here. Get your hands in here.
- Grab hold!

31:36.763 --> 31:40.131
All right, guys. One, two, three!

31:43.560 --> 31:45.681
- She needs oxygen!
- Got it. Got it.

31:46.853 --> 31:47.933
Hook her up.

31:49.272 --> 31:50.351
Go.

31:54.318 --> 31:56.689
- Here's our little action hero.
- How does it look?

31:56.902 --> 31:59.310
Like ground beef. No, more
like chopped liver.

31:59.529 --> 32:01.356
Can we salvage the limb?

32:01.530 --> 32:04.153
Want my honest opinion?
No, I don't think you do.

32:04.365 --> 32:08.826
- I'd like to give it our best shot.
- You got it, Lizzie. 110 percent.

32:11.622 --> 32:15.037
- Can you feel this?
- It's kind of numb. Is that bad?

32:15.250 --> 32:18.535
It means the leg's tensing.
I'll measure the internal pressure.

32:18.753 --> 32:21.421
Transducer's up in the ER.
HazMat won't find it.

32:21.630 --> 32:26.420
All right. Then I need an 18-gauge
needle, IV tubing and a BP manometer.

32:26.632 --> 32:27.960
You got it.

32:28.843 --> 32:32.459
Then I watched them put you
on a gurney and give you oxygen.

32:32.679 --> 32:33.709
Then what happened?

32:33.887 --> 32:36.379
They moved me from a yellow room
to a green room.

32:36.556 --> 32:40.719
That would be Trauma 2.
But where was I at that time?

32:40.936 --> 32:42.761
Then they put you in the yellow room.

32:42.977 --> 32:47.140
That's where they removed all of your
clothes and put them into a plastic bag.

32:49.817 --> 32:50.847
Two more to go.

32:51.067 --> 32:53.272
- What about the ER?
- It'll take awhile.

32:53.861 --> 32:56.315
- Is there a doctor around?
- Right here.

32:56.487 --> 32:57.518
Hard to breathe.

32:57.738 --> 32:59.196
- I'm coming.
- No. Suits only.

32:59.364 --> 33:00.989
Suit me up. He's in trouble.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.153
It'll take 15 minutes to suit up.
He'll be out by then.

33:04.368 --> 33:06.028
Doc, do something!

33:06.287 --> 33:08.077
You won't let me in? He could die.

33:08.288 --> 33:09.912
- Mike, give him oxygen!
- Morrie!

33:10.664 --> 33:14.079
- He's not talking! Do something!
- Get me an airway kit now!

33:14.251 --> 33:17.251
Give him one more minute.
Tube him when he comes out.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.410
Morrie! Morrie!

33:21.839 --> 33:23.417
Help him!

33:24.799 --> 33:26.377
Do something! Help him!

33:26.552 --> 33:27.582
That's pretty stupid.

33:27.761 --> 33:30.879
Do something for Morrie!

33:33.139 --> 33:36.055
He's dirty now. Let him do it.

33:37.101 --> 33:39.175
- Anybody here an EMT?
- I'm a medic.

33:40.269 --> 33:41.431
Bag him when I'm done.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.760
You got it.

33:53.612 --> 33:54.693
I'm in.

33:55.281 --> 33:57.107
- Scrub him.
- Let's go, doc.

33:57.282 --> 33:59.440
- Let's go.
- Wait.

34:04.579 --> 34:06.323
Dr. Carter. Come in, Dr. Carter.

34:06.498 --> 34:07.528
I need to talk to her.

34:07.748 --> 34:09.076
I got you covered, doc.

34:21.465 --> 34:22.545
How's he doing?

34:23.802 --> 34:25.260
He's picking up. Looks good.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.664
Great.

34:35.944 --> 34:37.188
Sixty, 70.

34:37.362 --> 34:38.442
What does that mean?

34:38.614 --> 34:42.067
The pressure's too high from
the bleeding. We need to operate.

34:42.286 --> 34:44.196
I need you over here!

34:44.415 --> 34:45.956
Jerry, book a room!

34:46.125 --> 34:48.746
Charging to 200. Clear!

34:48.962 --> 34:52.130
- Still in fib.
- All right. Charge to 300.

34:52.635 --> 34:53.831
Clear!

34:56.723 --> 35:00.093
- Can we take him inside?
- In a minute.

35:00.312 --> 35:01.594
What about my shoes?

35:01.815 --> 35:03.973
Ernie, take care of Dr. Carter.

35:06.029 --> 35:08.947
His heart's up to 98.
He's waking up.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.079
He sounds pretty good. I think
you'll be okay, Morris.

35:13.289 --> 35:15.996
- Dr. Carter?
- No, man. Real shoes.

35:17.253 --> 35:19.579
Malik! Help us move him inside?

35:19.799 --> 35:22.551
Hold up. They're coding
some old lady in the cafeteria.

35:32.568 --> 35:34.193
I said charge it to 360.

35:34.404 --> 35:37.490
Wait, it takes time.
The battery's low. Okay.

35:38.493 --> 35:39.691
Clear!

35:40.204 --> 35:42.492
Asystole.
How long have we been at this?

35:42.665 --> 35:43.698
Eighteen minutes.

35:43.917 --> 35:46.671
She never had a rhythm or a pulse.
That's it.

35:48.382 --> 35:50.460
Time of death: 22:09.

35:50.677 --> 35:51.876
OR's ready for Krakowski.

35:52.054 --> 35:55.389
I've got a fasciotomy.
See if you can find her family.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.930
Did that lady just die?
I mean, is she dead?

36:00.650 --> 36:02.691
They're not gonna leave her there?

36:02.904 --> 36:04.648
- Where are the pre-op labs?
- Here.

36:04.865 --> 36:07.820
- How long will I be in a cast?
- Four to six weeks.

36:08.912 --> 36:11.155
- Anna's running the code?
- Yeah, but we just-

36:12.334 --> 36:16.379
Five rounds of epi. Two of atropine.
Lidocaine-

36:20.638 --> 36:22.465
Bretylium, amiodarone.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.886
- Should've been in the ICU.
- Wouldn't have made a difference.

36:26.062 --> 36:27.094
Might've.

36:27.273 --> 36:29.978
No. You turned this place into an ICU.

36:31.361 --> 36:35.231
This isn't an ICU. This is just
something we threw together.

36:38.289 --> 36:39.748
This shouldn't have happened.

36:39.958 --> 36:42.283
Look. Inoperable triple-vessel disease.

36:43.004 --> 36:45.210
It was only a matter of time.

36:46.926 --> 36:49.085
Mr. Arteburn, you okay?

36:49.304 --> 36:51.796
Dizzy. Very dizzy.

36:51.975 --> 36:55.595
Superventricular tachycardia.
Adenosine 6 mgs, IV.

36:55.773 --> 36:56.803
We don't have any.

36:57.024 --> 37:00.643
- Jerry, run to the pharmacy.
- Do you need some help?

37:01.614 --> 37:03.941
Jeanie, help out Dr. Weaver.

37:04.118 --> 37:05.149
Take it easy.

37:05.369 --> 37:08.241
Pulse is weak and thready.
Any chest pain?

37:08.416 --> 37:10.705
We can't wait for adenosine.
It's a cardiovert.

37:10.918 --> 37:12.379
Lily, grab a crash cart!

37:12.588 --> 37:14.666
Let's get him into Trendelenberg.

37:15.468 --> 37:17.128
I'll try carotid sinus massage.

37:17.345 --> 37:19.005
Yosh. Can you get a BP?

37:19.181 --> 37:20.213
Lily, charge to 100.

37:20.434 --> 37:22.260
Mr. Arteburn? Mr. Arteburn?

37:22.436 --> 37:24.559
- He's unresponsive.
- Give me the paddles.

37:24.773 --> 37:27.098
- Battery's dead.
- I'll find an extension cord.

37:27.276 --> 37:29.270
No, there's an outlet.
Help me move him.

37:29.488 --> 37:32.276
- Move that gurney out of the way!
- BP's 60 palp.

37:32.493 --> 37:34.569
He's not moving much air.
I gotta tube him.

37:34.788 --> 37:36.282
Carter? Carter?

37:38.292 --> 37:39.704
Get ready to start CPR.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.079
I need an intubation tray.

37:42.298 --> 37:43.924
Carter?

37:45.511 --> 37:47.967
Lily, when we get power,
we need to move him.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.141
Get over here!
I need you to bag him.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.971
Almost ready!

37:52.939 --> 37:54.019
Hold that.

38:10.631 --> 38:11.663
Normal sinus rhythm.

38:11.884 --> 38:14.090
What are you people
doing to me?!

38:14.303 --> 38:17.305
You had an abnormal heart rhythm.
We had to treat you.

38:17.516 --> 38:19.844
- By drowning me?!
- It's a diving reflex.

38:20.062 --> 38:22.601
It slows the heart,
breaks the tachycardia.

38:22.816 --> 38:27.361
You call this the highest standard
of care? Get my doctor on the phone!

38:27.530 --> 38:30.105
I got the adenosine. We're okay.

38:30.326 --> 38:33.994
I'll meet you in Recovery. I want
to be there when he wakes up.

38:34.166 --> 38:35.198
Yes.

38:36.002 --> 38:38.329
- Elizabeth.
- Hello, Peter.

38:38.546 --> 38:39.828
I'll be right there.

38:40.676 --> 38:42.882
Oh, your eye looks worse.

38:43.095 --> 38:45.385
I'm sure it looks nastier than it is.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.681
Let me have a look anyway.
You could have a hyphema.

38:51.608 --> 38:54.777
So I heard about the big rescue.

38:55.946 --> 38:57.692
You were under a collapsed building?

38:57.867 --> 39:02.162
Went all out to avoid amputation.
But we had to take his arm anyway.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.833
Okay. You okay?

39:05.920 --> 39:08.792
Have to tell Leo about his arm
when he wakes up.

39:09.593 --> 39:11.751
What about you?
You on call tonight?

39:11.929 --> 39:15.430
I've got a fasciotomy.
After that, I'm free.

39:15.643 --> 39:17.803
I could do with some debriefing.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.027
Take a deep breath in.

39:22.236 --> 39:25.487
Now blow out.

39:25.699 --> 39:27.490
Can we get a blood gas in 20 minutes?

39:27.660 --> 39:29.204
My throat's sore.

39:30.665 --> 39:33.204
- Give her some water.
- Yep. There you go.

39:35.339 --> 39:37.212
That was pretty scary, wasn't it?

39:37.425 --> 39:39.751
No. We do that kind of thing
here every day.

39:39.970 --> 39:43.257
No. You were scared.
Tell the truth.

39:45.103 --> 39:47.594
- I was pretty scared.
- I was really scared.

39:48.316 --> 39:51.602
Honey, I've been looking
all over for you.

39:51.820 --> 39:52.853
Is she okay?

39:53.030 --> 39:54.609
She's fine.

39:54.867 --> 39:56.361
I heard about the fumes.

39:56.577 --> 39:59.698
- Was she exposed?
- Her lungs weren't exposed.

39:59.874 --> 40:02.199
- She was never in any danger?
- No, Mom.

40:04.672 --> 40:06.500
They took really good care of me.

40:09.262 --> 40:10.923
Excuse me. The ER.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.679
Okay. Dr. Lemley, if you'll...?

40:13.894 --> 40:16.730
I'll come back and check on you.
You're in good hands.

40:16.899 --> 40:19.569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Carol?

40:20.696 --> 40:24.778
- Have Pharmacy restock the drug boxes.
- Sure.

40:24.994 --> 40:27.402
- Are you still mad at me?
- I was mad?

40:27.581 --> 40:30.500
- You accused me of spying on you.
- I never said that.

40:30.711 --> 40:31.909
That's what you meant.

40:32.129 --> 40:34.503
I was annoyed. You don't
need to check on me.

40:34.717 --> 40:38.586
I wasn't. I just wanted
to see you last night.

40:40.349 --> 40:41.725
Me too.

40:42.143 --> 40:44.932
We shouldn't let that happen
too often, should we?

40:45.148 --> 40:48.769
I actually think we shouldn't
let that happen at all, but-

40:52.909 --> 40:54.285
Here goes nothing.

41:35.096 --> 41:36.639
Okay, Mr. Arteburn.

41:36.849 --> 41:40.516
Let's put you down into Curtain 1.

41:42.356 --> 41:44.599
Take Manny and put him in Curtain 2.

41:44.819 --> 41:48.521
- Morris, 2B.
- Carter, I can take it from here.

41:49.783 --> 41:54.033
Put the sickest patients
in the trauma rooms and curtains.

41:54.207 --> 41:55.240
- Jeanie.
- Yeah?

41:55.418 --> 41:58.834
You and Jerry update the board
and get the phones back.

41:59.047 --> 42:00.922
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

42:01.134 --> 42:04.552
I spoke with Harriet Spooner,
the incident commander.

42:04.723 --> 42:07.393
I would like to thank you
for helping me out.

42:07.560 --> 42:10.895
The administration would like you
to speak with the press.

42:11.483 --> 42:16.192
We'll meet them together in the
first-floor conference room at 11: 15.

42:16.406 --> 42:20.869
In terms of dealing with these people,
I've got more experience.

42:21.078 --> 42:24.532
It's important that the emphasis-

42:24.752 --> 42:27.327
- No. Morris gets that vent!
- All right.

42:27.505 --> 42:29.167
It's important that the emphasis...

42:29.382 --> 42:33.170
...be placed on the institutional
response to the crisis...

42:33.389 --> 42:35.548
...as opposed to any
individual efforts.

42:35.767 --> 42:37.428
They would tend to sensationalize.

42:37.603 --> 42:40.310
I think it's best to say simply that...

42:40.524 --> 42:43.610
...we followed a well-rehearsed
disaster plan...

42:43.821 --> 42:47.274
...and worked with HazMat
to ensure the safety of our patients...

42:47.493 --> 42:48.738
...and also the staff.

42:49.413 --> 42:51.820
The fire captain wants
to speak with you.

42:52.041 --> 42:53.370
Oh, right. 11: 15?

42:53.586 --> 42:55.080
- That's right.
- I'll be there.

42:55.296 --> 42:58.334
I've looked at some of
the causative factors...

42:58.551 --> 43:00.675
...and I can now identify
those at blame.

43:00.888 --> 43:02.169
What are you talking about?

43:02.390 --> 43:05.226
I've been on nights,
and during that time...

43:05.437 --> 43:10.147
...the day unit service coordinators
have let the central area deteriorate.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.518
Jerry, this was a chemical spill.

43:12.738 --> 43:14.648
Yes, and we were impaired...

43:14.825 --> 43:17.743
...because we were unable to find
this important manual.

43:17.955 --> 43:20.873
Now that I'm back on days,
you can count on...

43:21.042 --> 43:23.748
...a higher level of efficiency
at the central work area.

43:23.962 --> 43:27.214
If you pass out again,
I'll have everything under control.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.017
Dr. Carter!

43:34.187 --> 43:35.218
Want these back?

43:35.439 --> 43:37.811
No. Souvenir.

43:38.485 --> 43:40.561
How do you think your people
handled things?

43:40.779 --> 43:42.489
Oh, pretty good.

43:43.366 --> 43:45.325
No. It was a total disaster.

43:46.037 --> 43:48.364
You guys were caught
with your pants down.

43:49.709 --> 43:52.961
But you personally did okay
under the circumstances.

43:53.590 --> 43:57.256
I think you're the guy to work with
on a schedule of disaster drills.

43:58.179 --> 44:02.428
I don't have that kind of authority.
I'm just an intern.

44:03.688 --> 44:04.934
You had me fooled.

44:05.150 --> 44:07.059
You should talk to our chief of staff.

44:13.912 --> 44:15.951
It was good working with you.

44:24.009 --> 44:25.208
Hey, Carter!

44:25.387 --> 44:27.380
Hey! When did you get back?

44:27.598 --> 44:30.600
Came straight from the airport.
I'm on in five minutes.

44:30.811 --> 44:33.481
It's good to see you.
How's your mom?

44:33.690 --> 44:35.731
She's doing better.

44:36.402 --> 44:37.896
What's with the boots?

44:38.405 --> 44:41.054
It's kind of a long story.
