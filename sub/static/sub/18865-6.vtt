WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.335
Jocelyn: Okay, Jazzigals,

00:03.370 --> 00:05.537
let's gather in for a warm-up!

00:06.940 --> 00:08.273
Okay!

00:08.308 --> 00:10.108
- Oh, before we start,

00:10.143 --> 00:12.044
I just wanted warn everybody,

00:12.079 --> 00:15.113
there is a murderer
on the loose.

00:15.148 --> 00:16.615
In this town.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.950
- Uh-oh.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.453
- So heads up,
eyes peeled, guys.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.688
Moira: Twyla, are you all
right?

00:23.723 --> 00:25.123
- I will be...

00:25.158 --> 00:27.325
if I can get a few friends
together this weekend

00:27.360 --> 00:29.528
to catch this murderer.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.097
Until then, it shall remain
a mystery!

00:32.132 --> 00:35.500
- Oh, I think I know where
this is going!

00:35.535 --> 00:37.869
- It's my murder mystery party
this weekend.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.271
- Oh, I see!

00:39.306 --> 00:40.972
- Sorry if I scared anyone.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.475
Jocelyn: I was scared you
weren't gonna have it this year!

00:43.510 --> 00:46.044
- John and I used to attend
"Eyes Wide Shut" parties

00:46.079 --> 00:48.180
at the Castros'.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.949
Though I'm guessing your
evening's activities

00:50.984 --> 00:52.384
might be somewhat different.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.319
- I don't know,

00:54.354 --> 00:56.421
it can get pretty wild.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.024
- Oh yeah, you never know how
the evening's gonna end!

00:59.059 --> 01:01.393
- Or when!

01:01.428 --> 01:04.629
- Well, John and I would love
to help you ensnare this maniac,

01:04.664 --> 01:07.466
but we have plans
this Saturday night.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.801
- Oh well, the party's
actually Friday.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.670
- I had a 50/50 chance there.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.638
- So you can come?

01:13.673 --> 01:17.142
- Oh, I would be pleased
to rsvp as...

01:17.177 --> 01:18.577
pending.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.645
Just, uh, as soon
as I double check,

01:20.680 --> 01:22.080
and circle back.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.582
- Mhmm.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.553
- Oh, this is gonna be
so great!

01:28.588 --> 01:33.425
♪ ♪

01:35.128 --> 01:37.229
- 1 P.M., terrific.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.097
Yeah, looking forward.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.599
Bye.

01:42.469 --> 01:43.802
- Did somebody book a room?

01:43.837 --> 01:47.105
- Even better, someone might
book a room.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.540
- How is that better?

01:48.575 --> 01:50.609
- A lot of people might book
a room if this goes through.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.544
- Okay, but you're still using
the word "might."

01:52.579 --> 01:54.379
- That was the Elm Glen
Golf Club.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.314
They wanna put together
a package with us.

01:56.349 --> 01:57.682
a weekend of golf,

01:57.717 --> 02:01.119
and a stay at a luxurious motel.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.521
- What motel is that?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.256
- I'm gonna let them
work out the verbiage,

02:04.291 --> 02:05.590
but the upshot is this:

02:05.625 --> 02:07.259
on a $250 dollar package,

02:07.294 --> 02:09.661
a cool $40 goes into
our pockets.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.530
- That sounds like a better
deal for them.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.065
- Well, it's all about
building bridges, Stevie.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.433
But here's the thing,

02:15.468 --> 02:17.369
even if this deal falls through,

02:17.404 --> 02:20.605
we still get an afternoon
on a golf course!

02:20.640 --> 02:21.840
- "We?"

02:21.875 --> 02:23.708
- This is a big day for us,
Stevie!

02:23.743 --> 02:25.243
- You know it's been
three years

02:25.278 --> 02:27.179
since I've played a round
of golf?

02:27.214 --> 02:30.682
- Yeah, um... golf's
not really my thing.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.484
Except there was this one point
in high school

02:32.519 --> 02:35.220
where I got this haircut
that everyone said

02:35.255 --> 02:37.322
made me look like I was
in the LPGA.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.590
- Well, listen, I'm sure
you could use

02:38.625 --> 02:40.425
an afternoon outdoors, okay?

02:40.460 --> 02:42.861
Think of it as
a team-building exercise.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.563
- Okay.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.698
I might even let you drive
the cart.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.800
- Can you drink on the cart?
- Yeah.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.570
- Well, I will get the
"back in 15 minutes" sign.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.539
- Well, it's gonna take longer
than 15 minutes.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.910
- You have to give people hope.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.683
(Music plays, patrons chatter)

03:07.954 --> 03:09.554
- So, Mrs. Rose,

03:09.589 --> 03:11.323
I don't mean to pressure you,

03:11.358 --> 03:12.724
but I am anxious to know--

03:12.759 --> 03:16.428
- Understandably, yes,
BLT please, no bread.

03:16.463 --> 03:17.729
- Oh, I meant if you
were coming

03:17.764 --> 03:19.197
to the murder mystery party.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.366
- Oh that, yes.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.801
- Yes, you are?

03:22.836 --> 03:25.270
- It's just that it's the end
of the week Twyla,

03:25.305 --> 03:27.272
so that's always chockablock.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.540
And then there are the kids...

03:28.575 --> 03:30.041
Well, both of them,

03:30.076 --> 03:31.643
David, Alexis.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.479
- Well, I know you're busy,
I was just-I don't know,

03:34.514 --> 03:36.448
I was just hoping you'd bring
a little something

03:36.483 --> 03:37.849
to the party.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.584
- A touch of celebrity, perhaps.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.553
- I was actually thinking bagel bites.
- Ah!

03:41.588 --> 03:42.887
- Did I mention it was
a potluck?

03:42.922 --> 03:45.690
- Oh, you most certainly
did not.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.495
- Well, I would ask
someone else,

03:50.530 --> 03:53.832
it's just that uh,
so far no one is coming.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.801
- No one's coming
to your party?

03:56.836 --> 04:00.639
- Well, in fairness, the party
is still a few hours away,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.507
and some people did say
that if another thing

04:02.542 --> 04:03.842
that's supposed to happen
doesn't happen,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.477
then they might be able
to come.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.945
So, that's good.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.414
- So as of now you have no one
on your guest list?

04:09.449 --> 04:11.283
- Well, I shouldn't have
said no one.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.717
My mom will come,

04:12.752 --> 04:15.720
and she'll probably bring
whoever she's dating.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.922
And he'll most likely bring
some younger friend.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.892
- Twyla, this is unacceptable!

04:20.927 --> 04:24.663
There are myriad tactics
to boost numbers at your party!

04:24.698 --> 04:27.732
Well, you start by comping
a few influential guests.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.768
You'd be shocked at how many
celebrities show up to a thing

04:29.803 --> 04:32.037
with the promise of a free
wagyu slider.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.407
- I-I'm not charging anyone,
this is just for fun.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.876
- Oh, this is worse
than I assumed!

04:37.911 --> 04:40.712
How about a signature cocktail?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.480
- I hadn't thought of that.

04:42.515 --> 04:45.050
- Okay, shouldn't you be--
- Oh, yeah.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.851
- Okay, we're going to start
with follow-up.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.920
You secure your VIP list,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.389
and you work your way down
from there.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.326
(Birds chirp)

04:57.630 --> 04:59.130
(Door slams)

04:59.165 --> 05:01.399
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.867
- Where's Stevie?

05:02.902 --> 05:05.704
- Um, I don't know, but she
will be back in 15 minutes.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.238
- What are you doing?

05:07.273 --> 05:09.040
- I'm just checking the mail.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.743
Did you know that you can
still get mail?

05:11.778 --> 05:13.545
- Yes, I know about mail.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.680
- No, but I'm talking
about like mail mail.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.449
Like a little man in a uniform,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.150
with his satchel full
of letters,

05:19.185 --> 05:20.752
travelling door to door.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.954
- Um, that's a mailman,

05:22.989 --> 05:25.957
and he comes to your house,
you pay him,

05:25.992 --> 05:28.927
and he gives you your stuff.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.529
- I think it's free delivery,
David.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.832
- I don't think so...
- Mmm!

05:35.168 --> 05:38.670
- How far into the 15 minutes
do you think we are?

05:38.705 --> 05:41.473
- Okay, don't take this
the wrong way,

05:41.508 --> 05:44.709
but you've just been kind of
hanging around a lot lately,

05:44.744 --> 05:47.011
which isn't a bad thing,
- Mm-hmm...

05:47.046 --> 05:49.714
- but it's also not
a good thing.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.916
- Yeah, um...

05:51.951 --> 05:54.753
it's just that the town only
has so many ex-boyfriends

05:54.788 --> 05:57.389
to hand out secretary work.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.957
- Um, first of all, David,

05:58.992 --> 06:01.326
I am an assistant, not a secretary,
- Oh.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.762
- and second of all,
Ted is not my ex-boyfriend,

06:03.797 --> 06:06.297
he is ex-fiance.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.732
And I'll have you know

06:07.767 --> 06:10.902
that I might not be an assistant
for much longer.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.005
- What is this?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.074
- It's Elmdale College.
- Ooh.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.809
Ted and I have been talking
about me doing like,

06:17.844 --> 06:19.644
an accounting course,

06:19.679 --> 06:21.112
or an office management course,

06:21.147 --> 06:24.816
but I think I can maybe broaden
my horizons a bit.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.852
- You've circled
"Stars and Cosmology?"

06:27.887 --> 06:31.189
- Oh yeah, I thought it said
"Cosmetology."

06:31.224 --> 06:32.624
Ugh!

06:32.659 --> 06:35.059
- Can I just... for a sec?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.329
- Here is Jocelyn's visor,

06:38.364 --> 06:39.931
and her glove.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.800
- Oh, uh, I don't think
I'm gonna be playing,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.301
but thanks.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.171
- Okay, you know what, just
in case you change your mind,

06:46.206 --> 06:48.206
why don't I show you
a few pointers?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.741
I can do it right here
on Johnny.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.109
- Oh, I don't think so.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.545
- I mean, a few pointers
couldn't hurt.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.746
- Oh, I- I don't think that necessary.
- Here, come on, Jonathan.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.282
- Okay, whoa.
- Come on down.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.817
Right there, let me see
your stance,

06:58.852 --> 07:00.318
what do you got goin' here?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.987
- Well, the setup is very
important, Stevie.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.023
Uh, legs so far apart,

07:05.058 --> 07:07.058
knees slightly bent.
- Ooh!

07:07.093 --> 07:09.828
- Make sure you're nice
and balanced over the ball.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.296
- Wow. Woo!

07:11.331 --> 07:14.332
Johnny, I gotta tell you,
you have a sensational stance.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.468
- Well, I've been golfing
for 30 years, Roland.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.736
- Wow, I like that.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.104
There's one thing I don't
like about it,

07:20.139 --> 07:21.639
and let me show it to you.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.041
- I don't think I was asking.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.309
- Well, I think it's better
that we show Stevie,

07:24.344 --> 07:26.144
than just talk about it,
don't you?

07:26.179 --> 07:29.180
Right? Okay.
So just first off,

07:29.215 --> 07:30.815
spread your legs just a little
wider, if you would, for me.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.283
- All right.
- There, see, Stevie?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.853
they've gotta be like, sort of
like even with the shoulders,

07:34.888 --> 07:37.422
and if you would just pop
the old tush--

07:37.457 --> 07:38.990
just go, bam!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.959
That's it, and now loosen up
a little bit.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.327
- Okay.
- Yeah!

07:42.362 --> 07:43.828
- All right,
you know what, Roland,

07:43.863 --> 07:45.163
I think I should be
showing you,

07:45.198 --> 07:46.998
because I don't really
think you know

07:47.033 --> 07:48.433
what you're... doing.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.969
- Yes, right.
- Okay now grip, very important.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.137
- Yeah?
- Are you using the Vardon grip?

07:53.172 --> 07:54.939
- I am using La Var Don.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.008
- Are you watching this, Stevie?

07:57.043 --> 07:58.276
- Yeah, it was just a little
hard to understand,

07:58.311 --> 07:59.811
so I want a record of it.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.347
- Okay, delete that, please!
- Can I get a copy of that?

08:02.382 --> 08:03.648
- Yeah.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.421
- Oh hi, Moira.
- Hi.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.390
- I thought that Roland
might still be here.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.760
- No, it seems our mayor
is keeping summer hours.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.962
- Gotcha.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.398
Jocelyn...

08:20.433 --> 08:23.368
it's really good to see
you out and about.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.270
Yes, I was starting to worry.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.505
- Why?
- Well, I happened to be chatting

08:27.540 --> 08:30.174
with our dear little Twyla
about her party tonight,

08:30.209 --> 08:34.145
and she mentioned that you
have yet to RSVP?

08:34.180 --> 08:36.981
And I thought, that's not
the Jocelyn I know.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.218
What must've felled her?

08:40.253 --> 08:43.021
- I'm fine. Here's the thing.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.056
These parties are not great.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.859
Last year it went until 3 am,

08:47.894 --> 08:51.095
and Twyla just wandered around
kind of winking at everybody

08:51.130 --> 08:53.331
until she realized
she hadn't picked a murderer.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.100
And then the year before
there were three murderers,

08:56.135 --> 08:58.870
and one of them actually
robbed the cafe!

08:58.905 --> 09:02.340
- Well, I hear this year is
going to be very different.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.876
Twyla apparently sought
counsel.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.544
Expect thoughtful party favors,

09:06.579 --> 09:08.246
themed cocktails,

09:08.281 --> 09:10.081
first class catering.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.449
- I thought it was a potluck?

09:11.484 --> 09:14.185
- You, Jocelyn,
are the mayor's wife,

09:14.220 --> 09:16.354
you are the self-appointed
leader of the Jazzigals,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.122
and most importantly,

09:18.157 --> 09:20.258
Twyla worships you.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.427
- She does?
- Yes.

09:22.462 --> 09:25.363
This party has real
momentum now.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.065
And with you attached,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.601
it's no less than a snowball
gathering speed,

09:29.636 --> 09:31.903
picking up bodies
as it rolls downhill.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.107
- And that's good?
- Very good.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.575
- (Laughs)

09:37.610 --> 09:40.345
Well, I guess I could talk
to the other Jazzigals.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.014
I just wish I hadn't thrown out
that flapper dress

09:43.049 --> 09:44.349
from Halloween last year.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.985
Oh!
- Spread the word!

09:47.020 --> 09:48.987
Be the snowball.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.023
- Be the snowball!

09:54.360 --> 09:55.693
- Okay, it's just that
I misplaced

09:55.728 --> 09:59.564
my high school diploma
when we lost our house.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.065
No, I wish it was a flood.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.068
Okay, well, chasing down
the paperwork

10:04.103 --> 10:06.671
seems like a lot of work.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.239
No, I know that--

10:08.274 --> 10:10.274
I know that your courses
require a lot of work,

10:10.309 --> 10:13.011
I'm just-- What if it was
a flood?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.315
Okay, fine. I will call you back
with the paperwork. Thanks.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.850
(Phone beeps off)

10:18.885 --> 10:20.184
- Um, what's going on?

10:20.219 --> 10:22.320
Are you looking at courses now?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.455
- Um, I'm just putting
some feelers out.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.224
A lot of people have
encouraged me

10:26.259 --> 10:27.759
to build on the skills
I acquired

10:27.794 --> 10:30.395
as creative director
of the Blouse Barn, so.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.796
- Like who?

10:31.831 --> 10:33.698
- I thought it could be
good for me.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.001
- Okay, well, this is sort
of my thing, though.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.203
- I really don't think
you can claim education

10:39.238 --> 10:40.672
as your thing,

10:40.707 --> 10:42.774
and I don't even think I'll be
able to take those courses

10:42.809 --> 10:44.609
'cause the stupid people
at the college

10:44.644 --> 10:46.110
wouldn't just take my word
for it

10:46.145 --> 10:49.247
when I told them that I had
a high school diploma.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.581
- But why do you need it,
though?

10:50.616 --> 10:52.583
- To prove that I graduated
high school.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.085
- Well, it's not like
they're gonna be like,

10:54.120 --> 10:56.254
"Oh, you don't have
your high school diploma,

10:56.289 --> 10:58.322
you can't come to our college."

10:58.357 --> 11:00.291
- That's almost word for word

11:00.326 --> 11:02.527
what they just said to me
on the phone.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.666
- Well... - I just don't think
I have that kind of time.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.804
- Okay, what are you doing?
- Reorganizing my knits!

11:15.441 --> 11:17.575
(Car rumbles)

11:20.780 --> 11:22.680
(Birds chirp)

11:25.418 --> 11:27.251
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh.

11:27.286 --> 11:28.853
- Mr. Rose, Ms. Budd.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.589
- Yes, please call me Johnny.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.726
Always nice to put a face
to the name.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.994
- Oh, I see you two came
dressed for the occasion.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.696
- Always ready.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.965
- I like your visor.
- Thanks, it's new.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.901
- So I hear there's quite a few
new developments at your motel.

11:43.936 --> 11:45.403
Uh, we'd love to hear
about them,

11:45.438 --> 11:47.605
why don't we have a seat?

11:48.908 --> 11:51.342
- Oh, you wanna have
the meeting inside,

11:51.377 --> 11:53.444
on a day like this?

11:53.479 --> 11:55.413
- Sorry, did you think
we'd be playing a round?

11:55.448 --> 11:57.782
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.918
We-we had a meeting earlier
at another club,

12:00.953 --> 12:03.488
and they wanted us
to test drive the course,

12:03.523 --> 12:05.790
so we're in the attire.

12:05.825 --> 12:08.659
- Oh, where were you playing?

12:09.929 --> 12:12.296
- Uh, we were playing at um...

12:13.766 --> 12:15.533
it was what course, Stevie?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.034
It was down the road.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.536
Uh, Maple...

12:18.571 --> 12:21.305
- Grove?
- Grove. Maple Grove.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.741
- Maple Grove?

12:23.776 --> 12:25.543
No, I don't know that one.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.912
- Oh, really?
It's a beautiful course.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.415
Very exclusive,
Uh, but it is set...

12:31.450 --> 12:32.984
way back off the road, it's--

12:33.019 --> 12:34.719
- Which might explain why
you've never seen

12:34.754 --> 12:37.288
or heard of it.
- Yeah.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.060
(Birds chirp)

12:43.095 --> 12:44.996
Johnny: So every room
will have wi-fi,

12:45.031 --> 12:48.032
and upgraded beds,
uh, working toilets,

12:48.067 --> 12:50.434
which probably sounds
like something

12:50.469 --> 12:51.836
I don't need to mention

12:51.871 --> 12:53.304
but, you know, just covering
all the bases.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.739
- Well, that sounds great.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.507
Um, it's just that um...

12:58.010 --> 13:00.011
we've been talking to
the Elmington Moto-Lodge,

13:00.046 --> 13:03.848
and they've got coin laundry,
and a Jacuzzi.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.318
- Well, we can certainly
put in a Jacuzzi.

13:07.353 --> 13:11.689
- Yeah, Jacuzzis are very
popular with our golfers.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.624
- Well, as an avid
golfer myself,

13:13.659 --> 13:16.060
I can tell you that
when you buy a golf package,

13:16.095 --> 13:18.763
you don't necessarily want
to spend the entire weekend

13:18.798 --> 13:20.264
sitting in your room.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.632
(Managers laugh)

13:21.667 --> 13:23.067
- Well, thanks for coming by.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.737
- And definitely let us know
when you've got that Jacuzzi.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.140
- Yes, we uh, we will.

13:31.777 --> 13:35.046
- I guess that's all,
that's it now, thanks.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.149
- Yeah, well, listen,
it's, uh, still early.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.819
Do you guys have any other
Plans this afternoon?

13:41.854 --> 13:44.088
- We have another meeting.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.891
- Oh well, you know
what they say,

13:46.926 --> 13:48.392
too much work...

13:48.427 --> 13:49.794
(All laugh)

13:49.829 --> 13:52.463
- Well, thanks for coming in.
- Okay.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.066
- You go on ahead. I'm just
gonna go use the restroom.

13:55.101 --> 13:59.170
- Oh sure, might as well use
some of the amenities.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.741
(Car whooshes by)

14:03.776 --> 14:05.209
(Dogs bark)

14:08.014 --> 14:10.147
- Hey.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.350
Um, you know those courses
we were talking about?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.151
- Oh yeah, I thought that
data management one

14:14.186 --> 14:15.686
looked like it might be
good for you.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.255
- Mm-hmm, yeah, I had
the same thought,

14:17.290 --> 14:19.824
but when I looked into it,
all the courses were full.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.092
And then the courses
that weren't full

14:21.127 --> 14:22.660
conflicted with each other,

14:22.695 --> 14:24.795
and then everything
just cancelled out.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.063
- Alexis, if you don't
wanna take the course,

14:26.098 --> 14:27.899
you don't have to take
the course.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.702
- No, there were courses
that did look very interesting.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.638
Um, it's just kind of
complicated.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.873
- Yeah, but it's so worth it.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.175
Sometimes I wish I could go
back to college.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.977
Pub nights, frisbee
in the quad...

14:40.012 --> 14:41.879
- Hmm!
- Late night hacky sack.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.782
- Mmm.
- We got some serious sack circles going.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.717
- Oh, so many sex circles.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.086
- Sack. Hacky sack.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.788
We always hoped
they'd lead to sex,

14:50.823 --> 14:52.924
but... still.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.625
College, so crazy.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.628
- So crazy.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.130
Um...

15:02.068 --> 15:04.402
Okay, the thing is...

15:04.437 --> 15:06.537
I can't go to college,

15:06.572 --> 15:08.873
yet.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.075
Because I didn't finish
high school.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.144
- Oh.
- I know. It's so embarrassing,

15:13.179 --> 15:15.947
and I never should've taken
that semester off.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.748
But I did meet Beyonce
in Mykonos,

15:17.783 --> 15:19.717
so it was almost worth it.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.052
- Didn't you say on your resume

15:21.087 --> 15:23.654
that you did four years
at UCLA?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.189
- Yes... technically,

15:25.224 --> 15:27.758
if you consider Bel Air
an extension of the campus,

15:27.793 --> 15:29.593
which everybody does.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.268
This might sound crazy,

15:37.303 --> 15:40.037
but I almost think I should
finish high school.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.707
- That doesn't sound crazy
at all.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.408
And truth be told,

15:44.443 --> 15:47.712
it took me a minute to finish
high school myself.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.347
- You're only saying that
to make me feel better.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.749
- No, no, me and some friends,
we just got in a car,

15:51.784 --> 15:53.651
and took off.
- Really?

15:53.686 --> 15:56.020
- Yeah, we were following
the American Idol tour.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.455
We missed a couple shows,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.190
but it's always the exact
same set,

15:59.225 --> 16:00.758
so... no regrets.

16:02.328 --> 16:05.496
- Um, I really wish you hadn't
told me that last little bit,

16:05.531 --> 16:06.764
but... thank you.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.633
- That makes two of us.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.070
- Good round?
- Not bad.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.239
Greens are a little fast,
but I like that.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.908
- Me too.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.511
- I've given a heads-up
to the starter.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.846
The tee is yours.

16:24.050 --> 16:27.151
Have a great round, you two.
- Thanks so much.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.387
- How did you make that happen?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.155
- I asked.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.325
- Well, that's very nice,
Stevie!

16:34.360 --> 16:35.526
Thank you.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.863
- Okay, let's get
our golf sticks.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.640
- David,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.043
and why am I not surprised
to see you in here?

16:52.078 --> 16:53.711
- Well, this is my room.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.180
- Well, it's disheartening
to see you like this.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.382
- Did you know that
according to IMDB,

16:58.417 --> 17:01.052
Rosa Parks was in an episode
of "Touched By an Angel?"

17:01.087 --> 17:02.553
- Exactly, David.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.155
You are bored, lethargic,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.991
and practically dripping
with ennui!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.626
- Okay, that's a bit much.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.361
- I blame myself.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.164
I've set a standard of activity
and engagement

17:13.199 --> 17:16.167
so high you don't even try.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.869
- Okay, I am on a much
needed respite

17:18.904 --> 17:20.471
whilst in between jobs.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.540
- You are squandering
your social capital.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.608
A tastemaker like you
should be out there,

17:24.643 --> 17:26.077
tasting things!

17:26.112 --> 17:27.711
- Uh, I'm at the buffet,

17:27.746 --> 17:30.247
and there is nothing to taste!

17:30.282 --> 17:33.117
- Well, there's a party
tonight, as a matter of fact.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.219
- The murder mystery thing?
- Why not?

17:35.254 --> 17:37.555
Does this town not deserve
to have a marquee guest

17:37.590 --> 17:40.157
like yourself grace
their humble soiree?

17:40.192 --> 17:42.026
- Speaking of marquee guests,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.394
I'm surprised you're going.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.762
- I can understand why
you'd say that,

17:44.797 --> 17:47.665
but don't you just know
Twyla would be thrilled

17:47.700 --> 17:50.501
to have as many Roses there
tonight as possible!

17:50.536 --> 17:52.403
- (Sighs)

17:52.438 --> 17:55.239
Fine, I will make
a surprise appearance.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.174
- Good.
- But it's twice around the room,

17:57.209 --> 17:59.343
and then I'm out.
- Is there any other way?

17:59.378 --> 18:01.378
Oh, and it's Roaring Twenties
themed,

18:01.413 --> 18:03.380
and I know you have a soft spot
for seersucker.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.949
- I won't be dressing up.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.284
- Aw, say, don't be
a dewdropper!

18:07.319 --> 18:09.120
Throw some concealer
under those peepers,

18:09.155 --> 18:12.356
make like a swell,
and go put on the Ritz!

18:19.198 --> 18:20.965
(Birds chirp, grass rustles)

18:23.035 --> 18:25.636
(Grass crunches underfoot)

18:35.181 --> 18:36.647
(Thwack)

18:39.351 --> 18:41.752
- Woo. Good golf shot!

18:41.787 --> 18:43.521
- Thank you, Stevie.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.528
Ah...

18:50.563 --> 18:53.130
(Golf cart starts up
and rumbles off)

18:58.437 --> 18:59.870
(Crickets chirp)

19:02.441 --> 19:04.275
(Clinks)
- Oh!

19:04.310 --> 19:06.310
- John, are you going
to be done soon?

19:06.345 --> 19:09.446
- Just working on my short
game, Moira.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.649
Stevie and I are pitching
Oak Valley next week,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.751
I just wanna make sure
I'm ready.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.353
- Well, the endless tinking
of putter to ball

19:16.388 --> 19:17.955
tells me you will be.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.224
- Well, it's for the motel.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.194
It's not like...
I'm enjoying this.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.896
(Phone rings)
- Ohhhh!

19:25.931 --> 19:27.264
Beautiful! See that?

19:27.299 --> 19:30.467
(Phone rings)
- Ahem!

19:30.502 --> 19:32.136
Rose residence.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.138
- Uh, where are you?!

19:34.173 --> 19:35.539
- May I ask who's calling?

19:35.574 --> 19:38.175
- You know who this is,
and you know where I am.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.677
- Did everyone show up?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.612
- Yes, everybody showed up.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.280
- Good, then my work is done.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.648
- Uh no, your job is not done.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.284
You guilted me into coming
here tonight!

19:47.319 --> 19:48.552
- And you're better off
for it, David.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.088
You should thank me.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.524
Twyla was set to throw a fiasco
until I exerted my influence.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.326
- Uh yeah, and the way
Twyla keeps asking

19:55.361 --> 19:56.727
about where you are,

19:56.762 --> 19:58.729
I'm pretty sure
you're the murderer.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.864
- Then they'll never catch me.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.401
- Ugh!

20:04.436 --> 20:05.936
- Who was that?

20:05.971 --> 20:07.338
- I don't know.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.508
Moira: Alexis, we sent you
to high school in Switzerland

20:11.543 --> 20:13.444
because we trusted you!

20:13.479 --> 20:16.313
- That school cost
$250,000 dollars!

20:16.348 --> 20:18.782
- I know, and I felt
so bad about it.

20:18.817 --> 20:22.686
And that is why I missed
my final semester.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.688
- Wait a minute,
we were at the graduation!

20:24.723 --> 20:27.391
- Yeah!
- I know, but I wasn't.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.627
- We saw you there!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.895
- Did we, though?
- Yeah, we were there.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.664
We might not have stayed
through the "R's."

20:33.699 --> 20:35.833
I think we left halfway
through the "L's."

20:35.868 --> 20:38.235
- Oh, yeah, it got
very repetitive.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.804
- No, I distinctly remember
a celebratory lunch

20:40.839 --> 20:42.773
at the Hotel de Ville,
in Crissier,

20:42.808 --> 20:44.475
and you'd had that
unfortunate run-in

20:44.510 --> 20:45.843
with the spray tan machine.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.645
- Mm-mm.
- No, that was-that was me.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.647
- Ah! Yeah!

20:49.682 --> 20:52.416
Then how do you explain
this graduation photo?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.718
Huh?

20:56.155 --> 20:57.955
- That's Jess Chang!

20:57.990 --> 21:01.025
- What? Jess Chang?
- Ugh!

21:01.060 --> 21:02.626
- Well, who can tell
with all this hair

21:02.661 --> 21:04.061
in front of your face?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.296
- That's not my face!

21:05.331 --> 21:07.631
- Okay, why didn't anyone
come to my graduation?

21:07.666 --> 21:09.533
- Well, you didn't graduate
in Switzerland.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.268
- And whose fault is that?!

21:11.303 --> 21:12.670
- How long have you been
carrying that around

21:12.705 --> 21:14.371
in your wallet?!
