00:04.088 --> 00:06.465
Mr. Cray's a big admirer
of the president, isn't he?

00:06.549 --> 00:09.677
He seems to think the war on drugs
can be won,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.178
and he's the man to win it.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.013
It's good to have you back in London,
Mr. Cray.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.558
In seven days' time,
I wanna be right here,

00:15.641 --> 00:18.352
when Feathered Serpent 2 launches
and we change the world.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.730
[man] The East London
Drug Rehabilitation Center.

00:20.813 --> 00:24.316
Last year, they approached
the Damian Cray Foundation for funding.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.277
I want you to work on this together.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.195
[Tom] This K7 guy,
totally slaughtered me.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.905
- [man] Who's K7?
- Top of the leaderboard.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.574
Yassen Gregorovitch isn't in Myanmar.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.367
I saw him in Cornwall.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.744
You are not an agent.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.162
I need to know owns this bike?

00:36.245 --> 00:37.747
It's registered to a man called
Simon Marriat.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.748
Run!

00:38.831 --> 00:40.416
[Yassen] I've been looking for you.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.756
You seem to be making a habit
out of this, arriving too late.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.132
It won't happen again.

00:55.598 --> 00:57.767
[theme music playing]

01:39.558 --> 01:42.186
[Alan] You can present it as a win.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.939
How exactly do you suggest I do that?

01:45.022 --> 01:49.068
[Alan] Smoking Mirror is no longer
a threat to Pentagon security.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.281
The great British sense of humor.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.999
A single hacker
could be a lone wolf vigilante.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.754
A single hacker taken out
by a professional hit

02:08.838 --> 02:11.048
becomes a cog in a conspiracy.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.134
This didn't get solved, Alan.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.469
It got bigger.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.395
Alex, what are you doing out here?
And what's happened to you?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.523
Uh, it's all right, sir.
I fell off my bike.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.816
You need to see the nurse.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.317
No, I'm okay.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.444
I'm not asking you, Alex. I'm telling you.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.821
Let's go. Now.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.203
[Dan] You ready for this?

02:41.287 --> 02:44.957
- I was up all night reading.
- Me, too.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.166
How do I look?

02:47.209 --> 02:49.378
You clean up okay.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.463
[cell phone ringing]

02:51.547 --> 02:53.215
[man on PA]
Welcome to CrayStar International.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.425
Hello?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.635
[man on PA]
Home of the world's biggest computer game.

02:56.719 --> 02:57.970
When did this happen?

02:59.930 --> 03:01.181
How bad is it?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.143
What, now?

03:05.227 --> 03:06.770
I'll get right back to you.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.566
- What?
- Alex. He's been hurt.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.695
Go. I can handle CrayStar.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.114
I really have to stop
getting you to cover for me.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.490
That's okay.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.783
Go.

03:26.582 --> 03:27.791
[computers beeping]

03:27.875 --> 03:29.668
[Jones] Which terminal
was Smoking Mirror's?

03:29.752 --> 03:32.171
This one,
the one with the bullets through it.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.924
They traced him here,
from here to the hangar site,

03:35.007 --> 03:36.884
executed him there.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.846
Four other bodies.
That's a lot of collateral damage.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.145
What do you see?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.941
Urban camo.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.484
It's good.

03:53.567 --> 03:58.489
The door looks shoddy,
but the, uh, frame and core are steel.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.157
What about that?

04:01.784 --> 04:02.952
I doubt it's even connected.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.664
So the door looks shoddy, but it's not.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.832
You think the surveillance is the same?

04:10.250 --> 04:14.546
To secure this place,
you'd need two cameras outside,

04:14.630 --> 04:16.298
different angles.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.925
And one in here.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.970
Yes, with a clear view
of anyone coming in.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.304
[Crawley] Exactly.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.559
We're looking for a fish-eye lens
behind this desk.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.647
It would have to be small and concealed.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.651
[suspenseful music playing]

04:44.535 --> 04:45.619
Here.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.372
[Crawley] Clever.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.668
[man] Look, this is your third absence,

04:52.751 --> 04:54.503
your coursework's late,

04:54.586 --> 04:57.548
and you are slipping behind
with your grades.

04:57.631 --> 05:02.136
Especially maths and drama.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.598
Where have you been?

05:08.726 --> 05:10.185
Well?

05:15.274 --> 05:18.027
- This is my fault.
- Sorry?

05:18.110 --> 05:21.947
Alex has been seeing a therapist
at my suggestion.

05:22.031 --> 05:24.575
He was having issues
dealing with his uncle's death,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.785
and I thought it was best
if he talked it through

05:26.869 --> 05:28.370
with a professional.

05:28.454 --> 05:31.373
If you had made the school
aware of this situation,

05:31.457 --> 05:33.542
Miss Starbright, we would of course--

05:33.625 --> 05:36.462
I know. It's my fault entirely.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.631
And I'll make sure the sessions
are outside of school hours

05:39.715 --> 05:40.883
from now on

05:40.966 --> 05:44.511
so that Alex doesn't get further behind
with his schoolwork.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.393
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- Can we talk about it later?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.731
Alex, do you know
what I had to miss to be here?

05:58.692 --> 05:59.902
I'm sorry.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.073
Okay.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.240
Later.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.795
[indistinct chatter]

06:20.380 --> 06:21.548
You all right, mate?

06:30.766 --> 06:32.309
Smoking Mirror's dead.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.022
[somber music playing]

06:39.900 --> 06:41.902
Jeez. Um...

06:43.487 --> 06:46.281
Okay. Did he say anything?

06:47.491 --> 06:48.992
Damian Cray.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.162
What do you mean?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.456
Smoking Mirror,

06:54.540 --> 06:56.250
Simon Marriat,

06:56.333 --> 06:58.794
told me Damian Cray is dangerous.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.506
That he's capable of anything.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.640
You don't believe me.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.018
I do believe you.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.146
But do we believe him?

07:23.861 --> 07:25.654
Interview requests.
The Times, The Guardian,

07:25.737 --> 07:26.655
The Today Programme.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.408
- BBC?
- Yeah. You should do it.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.578
I don't know. I'm getting bored
of the sound of my own voice.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.122
- Hey, it's Lindy, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Cray.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.249
I'm hearing great things about your work.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.500
Great things.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.335
Thank you.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.629
- Tomorrow?
- Yup. Everyone's coming.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.340
- What about K7?
- Him we're still working on.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.301
- I thought you said everyone.
- He's hard to track down.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.304
Well, try harder.
He's top of the leaderboard, number one.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.098
- We have to have him.
- [cell phones ringing]

07:53.182 --> 07:54.808
I'll have to take this.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.979
Damian Cray.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.523
Yeah, sure. Put her on.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.025
Madam President.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.410
Alex? What are you doing here?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.078
I came to see you.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.247
What happened?

08:17.331 --> 08:18.415
We need to talk.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.669
What I said about your dad
and the book he was writing...

08:22.753 --> 08:25.422
I told you it was dangerous.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.966
Yeah, Alex, look,
I've been thinking about that, and--

08:28.050 --> 08:29.176
And I was right.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.055
This is all about Damian Cray.

08:34.598 --> 08:37.768
He wanted your dad dead
for something in that book.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.855
Alex, listen, my dad wanted
to finish the story in Cornwall.

08:41.939 --> 08:45.484
That's why we rented the house.
So maybe I got it wrong.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.985
Maybe he took all his papers with him

08:47.069 --> 08:49.404
and that's why his house
was all messed up.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.031
You know, he was looking for things.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.991
What about the cloud files?

08:53.075 --> 08:55.369
I don't know, but mistakes happen.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.247
Right? On computers? Glitches happen.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.916
No, Sabina.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.001
This wasn't a mistake.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.170
This wasn't a glitch.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.965
- Cray did this.
- You can't know that for sure.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.383
- I do.
- No, not really.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.842
I saw someone get shot.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.766
What?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.269
Smoking Mirror.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.690
The sketchy guy that was here,
remember?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.233
He was a hacker.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.277
Your dad was using him as a source.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.114
Damian Cray had him killed
right in front of me.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.324
Right in front of you?

09:35.534 --> 09:37.160
Yeah.

09:39.204 --> 09:44.126
The guy who killed him
was the same guy I saw in Cornwall.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.003
I've met him before.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.715
He works for an organization
that hires out to the highest bidder,

09:49.798 --> 09:51.675
and Damian Cray's a billionaire.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.469
He can afford the best.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.305
Yeah, I know.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.433
- It sounds a lot.
- What?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.185
Why would it sound a lot?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.937
Damian Cray hired a hitman
to kill my dad.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.232
Now he's out there killing other people,
and you're there watching.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.775
That's fine. That makes sense.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.194
Because you've met him before.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.529
And how do you do that?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.073
How do you get away from a hitman
with a gun

10:15.157 --> 10:17.284
who works for an organization?

10:18.243 --> 10:21.538
- Sabina--
- No, how do you get away?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.207
You're a schoolboy. How does that work?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.294
I'm not a schoolboy.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.548
You're not?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.467
I am.

10:33.550 --> 10:38.638
But I also do stuff for these people.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.893
Security Service people.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.227
Helping them.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.439
Like a spy.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.735
Kind of.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.071
"Like a spy. Kind of."

10:57.282 --> 10:59.659
My dad could die.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.037
- Or he could never wake up.
- I know--

11:02.120 --> 11:04.998
And you chose that
for your catfish moment?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.917
When you reveal
you're some secret agent,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.418
and you can uncover this,

11:08.502 --> 11:10.128
and you can save my dad for me.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.672
That's it, right? I got it right.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.468
And you hurt yourself.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.971
You hurt yourself to look good.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.433
You can't be here anymore.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.977
You need to see a psychiatrist.
You need help.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.979
But not here.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.483
- Sabina--
- Please stay away from me!

11:31.566 --> 11:34.903
And stay away from my dad
and my family, okay?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.907
Please, stay away from us.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.451
Do you understand me?

11:42.661 --> 11:46.081
Say you understand me.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.919
Yeah, I understand.

12:06.518 --> 12:09.479
[lock clicks, then door opens]

12:19.531 --> 12:22.159
- You okay?
- Not really.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.583
I screwed things up.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.419
With Sabina.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.421
Oh, Alex.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.466
I can't talk to people.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.259
You talk to people just fine.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.677
I mean, about this.

12:41.595 --> 12:45.807
I can't talk about this
because no one will believe me.

12:47.184 --> 12:50.437
Even Tom's asking questions,
and he's my best friend, you know?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.568
Do you believe me?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.533
If I got this right,

13:03.617 --> 13:06.620
you're saying Damian Cray
isn't what he seems.

13:06.703 --> 13:11.374
And you're asking me if I can ignore
a whole world of evidence

13:11.458 --> 13:13.376
that says he is,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.587
and trust you instead.

13:17.214 --> 13:21.343
People can be not what they seem.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.595
For good or bad.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.388
That's what I believe.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
But that's not what the problem is here.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.977
So, what is?

13:31.061 --> 13:35.607
The problem here
is that you're failing school.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.942
You're in harm's way.

13:37.025 --> 13:41.363
And the people that are supposed
to have your back aren't here anymore.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.533
This is your life coming apart.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.826
Trying to help someone else.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.372
Does she even still want your help?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.165
Do you think if Ian was here,

13:52.249 --> 13:54.751
he would just walk away
from someone in trouble?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.711
It was his job.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.505
Well, maybe it's mine right now.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.302
Sweetheart...

14:05.387 --> 14:06.596
it got him killed.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.854
[Jones] From the hidden camera
in the hackerspace.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.029
Well, that changes things.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.950
Yes. If Gregorovitch is here in London,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.244
isn't it possible
he might have been in Cornwall?

14:29.327 --> 14:30.704
Maybe.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.791
Smoking Mirror, the Pentagon,
these are targets

14:34.874 --> 14:36.084
that make sense for SCORPIA.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.045
Some journalist in the West Country,
less so.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.339
The Pentagon attack
was six months ago.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.427
I find it hard to believe
it took SCORPIA six months

14:45.510 --> 14:46.595
to acquire Smoking Mirror,

14:46.678 --> 14:48.513
- no matter how clever he was.
- Yeah.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.474
And the hackerspace.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.852
That was a rush job,
by Gregorovitch's standards.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.563
Perhaps Mirror wasn't a threat until now.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.648
Something shifted.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.816
Anything else?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.152
[Crawley]
There was a third party at the hangar.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.613
Forensics indicate
a chase up the stairwell.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.656
Shots fired but no kill.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.743
Looks like whoever was there
managed to escape

15:09.826 --> 15:11.328
by jumping from the mezzanine.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.749
[Evelyn] K7.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.375
- [Cray] You found him?
- [Evelyn] No.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.836
In fact, I'm wondering
if we should even keep trying.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.004
Why? We have to have K7.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.798
- We know nothing about him.
- We know he's head of the leaderboard.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.508
And that's the problem.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.844
You want the eyes of the world
on tomorrow's event.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.723
You want it livestreamed to all the fans.
What if he's too good?

15:31.806 --> 15:34.559
- What if he makes it look easy?
- He won't.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.269
You don't know that.

15:36.353 --> 15:40.607
He's an unknown variable, just when we
need complete control over our situation.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.108
Remember my computations.

15:42.192 --> 15:45.111
If just 11.35% of all potential players

15:45.195 --> 15:47.697
choose not to go online
at the time of launch, it won't work.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.325
All of this will have been for nothing.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.787
If this kid walks in and wins,

15:53.870 --> 15:56.456
he could undermine the whole project.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.625
Well, we'll just have to make sure
he doesn't win.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.337
I want him there, Evelyn.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.090
The best player in the world
playing the best game.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.802
Imagine how many views that will get.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.890
Help Charlie find him.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.434
I know you can do it.

I'm not buying you another coffee, Alex.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.836
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.838
Okay, well, I'll keep it short.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.840
Damian Cray.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.886
Billionaire, charity work,
Feathered Serpent, Damian Cray--

16:51.970 --> 16:52.971
I'm aware.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.557
- What do you know about him?
- Everything.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.270
No, seriously, everything.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.730
He's pals with the US president,

17:01.813 --> 17:03.231
he's been in the room
with the prime minister.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.984
The background checks
have been beyond extensive.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.944
And you think he's okay?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.654
We do.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.531
What about in his organization?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.951
The people close to him?
What about them?

17:16.202 --> 17:18.955
All right. I'll play.

Now there's CrayStar International,
which is the software and tech business,

17:36.389 --> 17:39.309
and The Damian Cray Foundation,
which is the charity work,

17:39.392 --> 17:43.146
and the two operate independently,
with different staff.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.315
For the business, Cray tends to attract

17:45.398 --> 17:48.234
a number of top people
from different fields.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.862
Wait. Stop.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.155
Go back.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.326
Stop.

Who's that?

17:59.287 --> 18:00.997
[Smithers] Charlie Roper.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.208
Head of public relations and media.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.169
Why?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.298
No reason.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.675
My mistake.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.012
Okay. Thanks.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.517
- Alex.
- Yeah?

18:23.686 --> 18:27.273
- Why the interest?
- Just a fan of his games, that's all.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.046
- Any luck?
- "Luck"?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.758
As a mathematical concept,
it doesn't exist.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.720
It's a simple matter of working out
the binomial distribution of X, N, and P,

18:57.804 --> 19:01.474
where X equals the probability
of success, N is the number of attempts,

19:01.558 --> 19:03.810
and P is the number of times you win.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.688
I was just asking if you'd managed
to track down our top-spot gamer.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.439
I'm not using luck.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.276
- Cray wants him.
- I know that.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.991
By the way,
any news about that friend of yours?

19:18.992 --> 19:22.245
- Sorry?
- The journalist who was injured.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.164
He wasn't my friend.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.667
And there's no news.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.258
- So Charlie Roper.
- Yeah.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.927
Head of public relations and media.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.846
And his photo was in Ed's office.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.350
- Why don't you just call him?
- You think he'd answer?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.519
- I wouldn't.
- Exactly.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.273
- You'd recognize him if he came out?
- Yeah.

19:52.358 --> 19:57.405
So you're just gonna wait here all day,

19:57.488 --> 19:59.782
and hope that he doesn't use
a back door,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.035
or leave through the basement car park,

20:02.118 --> 20:04.537

- I'm a friend of Ed Pleasance.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.575
We're wondering about targets, right?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.288
- I think we need to look at Damian Cray.
- Cray?

21:31.541 --> 21:32.542
Why?

21:34.711 --> 21:37.547
- I think he's on SCORPIA's radar.
- Where are you getting that?

21:38.548 --> 21:40.717
- Marriat's computer?
- Yeah.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.220
I recovered some data
from the edge sectors of the drive.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.014
Cray's name is in there.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.181
[Crawley] Damian Cray.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.393
That's a hell of a high-profile target.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.855
- But why him? The anti-drugs work?
- Yeah.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.565
[Smithers] Perhaps it's even simpler.

He has the president
of the United States

22:02.405 --> 22:03.656
you get to the president.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.910
[Charlie] How do you know Ed?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.664
I was with him in Cornwall
when they tried to kill him.

22:14.709 --> 22:15.918
"They"?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.670
- Damian Cray.
- [scoffs]

22:19.088 --> 22:21.299
Come on. That's not true.

22:21.382 --> 22:25.928
I mean, Cray, he can be
tough sometimes, kind of driven,

22:26.012 --> 22:28.014
maybe even a fanatic,
but he's not a killer.

22:28.097 --> 22:32.685
And I was there yesterday
when a hacker called Smoking Mirror

22:32.769 --> 22:35.271
got shot dead right in front of me.

22:38.649 --> 22:41.194
You're a school kid.
Why am I even talking to you?

22:41.277 --> 22:42.862
Because you know I'm right.

22:45.364 --> 22:49.619
Something's going on at Cray's company,
and that's why you went to Ed.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.829
You were the one
who told him about Smoking Mirror.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.708
Both of them were targeted.
One of them is dead.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.211
You could be next.

[Charlie] Look.

I was at university with Ed.
He was my friend.

23:20.399 --> 23:25.404
We lost touch, and then, out of the blue,
he came to me with his story.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.074
And, yeah, I told him.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.078
There are things happening
I don't understand.

They hired a criminal, for God's sake.
A dark web hacker.

- Do you know what for?
- No. I don't want to.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.254
Anyway...

23:42.421 --> 23:45.466
that's not what Ed was writing about.
He wanted to know about the game.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.551
Feathered Serpent?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.177
Damian's obsessed with it.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.764
He's been hounding the programmers
for months and months.

23:51.848 --> 23:52.974
It has to be on time.

23:53.057 --> 23:58.521
The servers have to handle, like,
a billion downloads simultaneously.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.273
There isn't anything else.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.446
That's all he cares about.
It's all about the game.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.282
So it's all about the game.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.702
What does it do?

24:13.786 --> 24:17.540
It's like a battleground
set in an Aztec universe...

24:17.623 --> 24:21.294
No, I mean,
does it harvest your personal data?

24:22.420 --> 24:25.506
Does it send subliminal messages
into your brain?

24:25.590 --> 24:27.550
Does it alter the way you think?

24:28.634 --> 24:31.721
What does it do that's worth killing for?

24:35.558 --> 24:38.895
I need to see a copy of the new version
before anyone else dies.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.398
You can't. It's locked on the servers.
Nobody sees it.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.984
There's only one copy
outside of Amsterdam.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.235
What one copy?

24:47.236 --> 24:48.237
It's a prize.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.825
Damian's giving away
one advance copy tonight.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.077
He's planning some sort of competition.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.831
We invited gamers.
We're livestreaming the whole thing.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.168
So invite me. I'll win it.

- You're head of PR.
- No, I mean, I can't.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.178

- Yes.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.054
Well, you can stop. I've got him.

25:57.974 --> 25:58.975
How?

26:00.393 --> 26:01.477
Asked around.

You should try that sometime.

to be on the edge sector of the drive?

26:24.667 --> 26:27.003
- Yeah. Lucky break.
- Very lucky.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.172
The drive was solid state.
There were no edge sectors.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.924
So where did you get Cray's name?

26:32.008 --> 26:34.176
The same place
you got Marriat's license plate?

26:35.344 --> 26:36.595

26:42.351 --> 26:43.644
Alex found him.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.897
Please tell me you're joking.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.861
So you've met with him?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.197
Twice.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.703
How is he?

27:01.704 --> 27:04.540
Bruised. Scraped.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.044
Like he fell off his bike.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.630
Or off a mezzanine.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.387
[Tom] Can't believe you get to be K7,
head of the leaderboard.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.766
That's my dream.
You stole my dream, man.

27:23.392 --> 27:26.729
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you need to act the part.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.982
And you actually have to win
this copy of the game, right?

27:30.066 --> 27:31.400
So how are you gonna do that?

27:31.484 --> 27:35.404
I mean, it's not like snowboarding
or kicking people.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.489
[chuckles]

27:39.075 --> 27:40.993
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.497
You've got until00 tonight.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.332
I mean, you've basically got

27:46.415 --> 27:50.211
three and a half hours
to be the best in the world.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.422
Okay, so teach me.

27:53.506 --> 27:57.176
Can't be done, dude. It's taken me ages
to get this good, and I'm still crap.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.637
So teach me the basics,
just so I can bluff it.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.764
That way when I get inside,
I can figure something out.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.266
What would you say
if someone asked you about the game?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.395
I'd say the Quetzal's OP and the Temple
of the Dead Gods needs a nerf.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.609
So the beginning,
it's basically a team effort, right?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.695
You got your tanks,
a couple of DPS's, your healers.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.615
But by endgame, you'll gonna be
one-on-one with one of these guys.

28:19.698 --> 28:24.161
So the main tactic is learning
when to start killing off your friends.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.871
Why don't you start at the beginning?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.166
Yeah. All right, fine. Give me that.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.091
- What are you doing?
- Starting from the beginning.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.467
Validating your pass.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.053
You're now K7.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.807
Let's get back to basics.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.871
[house music playing over speakers]

29:15.171 --> 29:16.881
[Alex] Can you believe that guy?

29:17.923 --> 29:21.177
I'm subscribed to that guy.
His name's Jonas.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.721
You sure you're ready for this?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.099
How hard can it be?

29:32.271 --> 29:34.607
[Cray on recording]
Welcome to our private pre-launch

29:34.690 --> 29:36.901
of Feathered Serpent 2.

29:36.984 --> 29:40.571
You are our nine elite selected gamers.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.656
Hey.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.867
You're Jonas, right?

29:44.950 --> 29:47.703
Hey. Fan of the channel?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.872
Yeah. Subscribed and everything.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.374
- [Jonas] And you are?
- [Cray] K7.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.377
Mr. Cray.

29:55.461 --> 29:59.215
Damian, please.
So you're the best in the world.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.552
I guess I don't need to ask
whether you like the game or not, right?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.387
Yeah. I think it's great.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.766
Well, we all think it's great. Come on, K.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.809
I'm talking gameplay mechanics.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.812
You've put the hours in.
As a player, what do you wanna see?

30:13.896 --> 30:15.773
Where can we push this
to the next level?

30:15.856 --> 30:18.400
What are you looking for from Version 2?

30:18.484 --> 30:23.572
Well, personally, I think...

30:23.656 --> 30:25.407
Quetzal's OP,

30:25.491 --> 30:28.661
and the Temple of the Dead Gods
badly needs a nerf.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.121
Exactly what I've been saying
for months now.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.207
Temple needs nerfing for sure.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.627
That's all gonna change, right?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.504
We're not gonna worry about any of this.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.298
You couldn't be more correct.

30:41.382 --> 30:43.926
- What's with the countdowns?
- I'm sorry?

30:44.009 --> 30:47.179
You've got countdowns
ticking all over London.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.931
You're making us wait
for the big moment?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.849
There's always a release date, K.

30:51.934 --> 30:54.019
The Marketing Department
decides that on me.

30:54.103 --> 30:54.937
Really?

30:56.021 --> 30:59.233
I didn't think you'd let
someone else decide when it drops.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.904
You seem to know me very well
for somebody I've never met before.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.656
I'm a big fan.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.742
So do we get to see the game?

31:08.826 --> 31:10.828
Now, that's a real question.

31:11.912 --> 31:12.913
Come on.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.336
[cell phone buzzing]

31:22.965 --> 31:26.218
[Damian] Allow me to introduce you
to Evelyn Anders.

31:26.302 --> 31:29.346
Our chief programmer, resident genius,

31:29.430 --> 31:33.267
and architect of Feathered Serpent 2.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.232
But I think this is what
you've all been waiting for.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.028
A playable demo of the game itself.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.115
So who wants to give it a go?

31:48.949 --> 31:51.076
K. You're the one who can't wait.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.996
Why don't you grab a seat,
show us how it's done?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.205
Is this for the prize?

31:55.289 --> 31:58.208
No. It's just for fun. And the honor.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.419
You're the best player in the world.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.964
Don't you wanna prove it
to the millions of people watching?

32:04.965 --> 32:07.343
No, I'm good.
You can let someone else have a go.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.513
I insist. It's my party, after all.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.808
You're a player.
That's the only reason you're here.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.477
[scoffs]

32:16.560 --> 32:18.687
I think we'd all like
to see your best game.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.397
I'm not here to play.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.400
I'm here to win.

32:23.484 --> 32:26.695
Show me the prize,
I'll show you my best game.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.030
Okay.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.783
Let's skip the warm up.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.534
Go straight to the main event.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.376
You want the prize?

32:41.627 --> 32:43.045
It's right there.

32:45.089 --> 32:49.259
The only advanced copy
of Version 2 in the world.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.637
Yours for the taking.

32:53.055 --> 32:57.601
But if you want it,
you're gonna have to play.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.770
And not like you've ever played before.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.606
This time, it's real.

33:02.690 --> 33:05.275
We're in the heart
of our development suite.

33:05.359 --> 33:09.571
Enough teraflops of processing power
to run a military-grade AI system.

33:11.782 --> 33:16.245
A positional tracking array accurate
to within a hundredth of a millimeter.

33:16.328 --> 33:21.750
And a haptic feedback rig
that will literally knock your socks off.

33:22.918 --> 33:28.340
This is the best augmented reality
interface on the planet.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.636
If you get hit, you're gonna feel it.

33:32.720 --> 33:37.391
So, K, you ready to show us
your best game?

33:37.474 --> 33:39.560
Or would you rather go home
while you still can?

33:39.643 --> 33:40.644
The choice is yours.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.271
I don't need my best game.

33:43.063 --> 33:45.023
I could walk this in my sleep.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.235
But let's just be clear.

33:49.403 --> 33:53.449
I win, I get the game.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.284
That's all there is to it?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.994

- Yeah.

- We need to get out of here.
- This way.

You didn't tell Blunt about Alex.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.851
No. You heard what he said.

Alex is not an agent. He's out.

We're supposed to look after our own.

Yes, and if we start
turning against each other,
