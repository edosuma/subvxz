WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.075
(Nikka Costa's
"Ching Ching Ching" playing)

00:04.075 --> 00:06.207
(Meredith) QUESTION--
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

00:06.207 --> 00:09.210
A COMPLETE STRANGER TOOK OFF
HER CLOTHES IN FRONT OF YOU,

00:09.210 --> 00:13.084
POINTED TO A BIG PURPLE SPLOTCH
ON HER BACK, AND ASKED,

00:13.084 --> 00:15.086
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING?"

00:15.086 --> 00:17.088
OKAY. HOW ABOUT IT, MARK?

00:17.088 --> 00:19.550
YOU KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS
WANTED ONE OF... THESE.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.523
IF YOU'RE A NORMAL PERSON,
THE ANSWER IS HOPEFULLY...

00:22.523 --> 00:24.525
(rattles)
NEVER.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.557
IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR...
(rattle)

00:26.557 --> 00:29.160
THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY...
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.062
NAH. I'M GOOD.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.204
I WILL TAKE
THAT WAFFLE IRON.

00:33.204 --> 00:36.207
WHAT? I HAVE NEVER EVEN
SEEN YOU EAT A WAFFLE.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.509
WELL, I WOULD IF I HAD
A WAFFLE IRON.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.211
(laughs) OKAY, CALLIE,

00:40.211 --> 00:42.413
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE
A WAFFLE IRON TO MALAWI,

00:42.413 --> 00:45.476
AND IT'S NOT GONNA DO ANYBODY
ANY GOOD SITTING IN STORAGE

00:45.476 --> 00:48.179
FOR THREE YEARS.
PEOPLE EXPECT DOCTORS
TO HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.581
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU WON
YOURSELF A WAFFLE IRON. OH!

00:50.581 --> 00:52.223
AND A FRENCH PRESS.

00:52.223 --> 00:56.127
HEY. STOP GIVING...
MY THINGS AWAY.

00:56.127 --> 00:57.588
♪ REVOLUTIONARY MEDIOCRITY ♪

00:57.588 --> 00:59.430
♪ IT'S LIKE AY, AY, AY ♪

00:59.430 --> 01:01.192
(slams door)

01:01.192 --> 01:03.764
MAYBE I SHOULD PASS
ON THE FRENCH PRESS.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.667
HMM.
THE TRUTH IS,
WE LOVE TO THINK

01:06.667 --> 01:09.670
THAT WE HAVE
ALL OF THE ANSWERS, TOO.
SO THE ART & LESLEY PHILLIPS
FOUNDATION

01:09.670 --> 01:12.673
DOES HAVE A FEW MORE HOOPS TO
JUMP THROUGH THAN THE OTHERS...
MM-HMM.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.675
BUT THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS
IS ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.507
AND IF YOU GET THIS GRANT,

01:16.507 --> 01:20.211
IT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO GET US STARTED.
WOW. YOU REALLY DID
YOUR HOMEWORK.

01:20.211 --> 01:22.313
I'M A GREAT STUDENT.
JUST THE KIND YOU WANT AROUND

01:22.313 --> 01:24.485
WHEN DOING A CLINICAL TRIAL.
(Derek chuckles)

01:24.485 --> 01:26.387
HOW'S THAT GOING?

01:26.387 --> 01:28.319
IT'S FINE.

01:28.319 --> 01:31.192
IS THIS BECAUSE RICHARD GAVE
HUNT THE $1 MILLION AND NOT ME?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.624
IS THAT WHY THINGS ARE FROSTY
BETWEEN YOU TWO?
WE'RE NOT FROSTY. WE'RE FINE.

01:33.624 --> 01:35.626
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOLIDARITY,

01:35.626 --> 01:37.828
I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO SKIP

01:37.828 --> 01:39.630
OWEN HUNT'S
TRAUMA CERTIFICATION LAB.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.602
GO. GET CERTIFIED.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.204
OKAY.
BASICALLY...

01:43.204 --> 01:45.336
DOCTORS ARE KNOW-IT-ALLS...

01:45.336 --> 01:48.539
UNTIL SOMETHING COMES ALONG
THAT REMINDS US WE'RE NOT.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.541
HEY, I NEED SOMEONE
TO HELP ME

01:50.541 --> 01:53.184
SET UP THE TRAUMA LAB AND KEEP
THINGS RUNNING SMOOTHLY.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.386
YOU'D GET YOUR CERTIFICATION
THAT WAY,

01:55.386 --> 01:58.389
AND IT'S A PRETTY EASY DAY.
IT'S A SKILLS LAB.
IT'S ALREADY AN EASY DAY.

01:58.389 --> 02:01.222
W--
DR. HUNT, I'M GOING TO NEED
TO BORROW DR. YANG.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.893
(elevator bell dings)

02:02.893 --> 02:05.556
OH. UH, WHAT'S UP?
LUNGS HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE
FOR ROY HENLEY,

02:05.556 --> 02:08.128
AND SINCE HE FOUND HIMSELF
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST

02:08.128 --> 02:09.630
BASED ON
DR. YANG'S RECOMMENDATION,

02:09.630 --> 02:11.702
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WOULD
MAKE HIM HER PATIENT.

02:11.702 --> 02:14.205
OKAY. UH, WHAT DO YOU
NEED ME TO DO?

02:14.205 --> 02:16.207
WELL, I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO MONITOR HIM

02:16.207 --> 02:18.709
WHILE I GO
PICK UP THE LUNGS.
SO I'LL BE ON MY OWN?

02:18.709 --> 02:20.311
NOPE. DR. McQUEEN,
THE CARDIO FELLOW,

02:20.311 --> 02:23.314
HE WILL BE AROUND ON THE OFF
CHANCE THAT YOU NEED ANYTHING.

02:23.314 --> 02:25.746
OH, AND I FINALLY WAS ABLE
TO GET ROY'S DAUGHTER

02:25.746 --> 02:27.248
TO AGREE TO COME IN,

02:27.248 --> 02:30.181
SO JUST, UH, KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR HER, OKAY?
OKAY.

02:30.181 --> 02:33.153
YOU'LL BE FINE.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.286
STILL AN EASY DAY.

02:35.286 --> 02:37.228
I KNOW.

02:38.929 --> 02:42.833
AM I EARLY? I TRIED
REALLYHARD NOT TO BE.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.335
THAT DOESN'T BODE WELL.

02:44.335 --> 02:47.668
WE DID THE SAME THING WITH
BAILEY WHEN WE WERE INTERNS.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.670
TAKE TURNS TREATING A DUMMY,
GET AN EARLY LUNCH,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.602
THEN GET BACK TO WORK.
IT'S LAME.

02:51.602 --> 02:54.475
CHARTER PLANE WAS FORCED INTO
AN EMERGENCY LANDING

02:54.475 --> 02:56.176
AND COLLIDED
WITH A GREYHOUND BUS.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.279
MASS-CASUALTY SITUATION.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.212
DO I NEED TO SAY IT AGAIN?
LET'S MOVE.
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

03:01.212 --> 03:03.514
CLOSE TO 30 VICTIMS
IN THE FIELD, SOME CRITICAL.

03:03.514 --> 03:06.257
MULTIPLE
BLUNT TRAUMA INJURIES.

03:06.257 --> 03:09.260
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

03:10.821 --> 03:13.894
(Jackson) AND I WAS SO LOOKING
FORWARD TO AN EARLY LUNCH.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.827
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

03:16.827 --> 03:25.276
THIS IS GONNA SUCK.

03:25.276 --> 03:28.279
WELCOME TO TRAUMA CERTIFICATION.
YOU WILL WORK IN TEAMS OF FOUR.

03:28.279 --> 03:30.581
EACH TEAM WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR NINE CASUALTIES.

03:30.581 --> 03:33.544
YOU MAY TREAT YOUR PATIENTS
USING ONLY WHAT YOU CAN CARRY

03:33.544 --> 03:35.946
WITH YOUR TWO HANDS
FROM THIS AMBULANCE.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.788
THE EVAC HELICOPTER
IS ON ITS WAY.

03:37.788 --> 03:40.321
YOU GET YOUR PATIENTS
ON THE HELICOPTER,

03:40.321 --> 03:43.254
YOU GET CERTIFIED.
ARE YOU READY?

03:43.254 --> 03:45.956
(doctors speak indistinctly)
GET TO WORK.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.529
(clears throat)

03:48.529 --> 03:50.230
DR. GREY.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.603
UH, CHRISTY CORNELL,
AGE 28.

03:52.603 --> 03:56.367
SHE'S HERE
FOR A GLUTEOPLASTY.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.709
SHE'S SO TINY. THERE'S HARDLY
ANYTHING THERE TO LIFT.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.841
THAT'S SORT OF THE POINT,
DR. GREY.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.513
I'M...

04:02.513 --> 04:04.315
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS--

04:04.315 --> 04:06.317
OH.
I'M--I'M--I'M SORRY.

04:06.317 --> 04:08.319
CHRISTY'S NOT HERE
FOR A LIFT.

04:08.319 --> 04:10.281
SHE'S HERE
FOR A GLUTEAL IMPLANT.

04:10.281 --> 04:13.954
YES. FINALLY GONNA GET
SOME JUNK UP IN THIS TRUNK.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.327
THIS PROGRAM SHOWS A RENDERING
OF WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT

04:16.327 --> 04:18.459
THE GLUTEUS TO LOOK LIKE
AFTER THE IMPLANT.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.691
OH.

04:20.691 --> 04:23.964
UM... COULD I SEE
WHAT IT'D LOOK LIKE

04:23.964 --> 04:26.497
KICKED UP A--
JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS?
SURE.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.499
(computer beeps)
MM.

04:28.499 --> 04:30.501
COUPLE MORE?

04:30.501 --> 04:32.903
(keyboard keys click,
computer beeps)

04:32.903 --> 04:35.376
COUPLE MORE?
(keyboard keys click,
computer beeps)

04:35.376 --> 04:38.309
OKAY, STOP. THAT'S IT.

04:38.309 --> 04:39.950
THAT'S MY ASS.

04:43.013 --> 04:46.016
OH, COME ON. (laughs)
THAT WAS FUNNY.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.460
ANY JOKE THAT STARTS WITH
AN ANIMAL WALKING INTO A BAR

04:49.460 --> 04:51.462
IS SCIENTIFICALLY UNFUNNY.

04:51.462 --> 04:53.824
WELL... (laughs)
HUMOR ME, DR. YANG.

04:53.824 --> 04:56.367
I NEED SOMETHING
TO FOCUS ON.

04:56.367 --> 04:59.370
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M MORE NERVOUS
ABOUT GETTING NEW LUNGS

04:59.370 --> 05:01.802
OR ABOUT
ACTUALLY SEEING MY DAUGHTER.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.934
DON'T THINK OF IT
AS GETTING NEW LUNGS.

05:03.934 --> 05:07.438
THINK OF IT AS GETTING RID
OF OLD, CRAPPY LUNGS.
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:07.438 --> 05:09.340
(monitor beeping erratically)

05:09.340 --> 05:11.912
OR DON'T THINK AT ALL.
OKAY, ROY.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.614
TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS.
OKAY?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.747
CORINNE?
(beeping normalizes)

05:16.747 --> 05:18.519
ROY.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.991
HOW YOU BEEN?

05:20.991 --> 05:23.654
THIS WEEK
OR FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS?

05:23.654 --> 05:25.095
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:25.095 --> 05:27.528
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS SNARKY.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.461
NO. NO, SNARKY'S GOOD.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.003
I LIKE SNARKY.
YOU GET THAT FROM ME.

05:33.003 --> 05:36.607
(beeping continues)

05:36.607 --> 05:39.640
(gasping)

05:39.640 --> 05:42.012
ROY? ROY?
(monitor beeping erratically)

05:42.012 --> 05:44.775
GET THE CRASH CART!
HE'S--HE'S NOT BREATHING.

05:44.775 --> 05:48.379
(woman)
V-FIB! PAGE CARDIO.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.451
(nurses speak indistinctly)

05:50.451 --> 05:53.353
AREN'T YOU THE DOCTOR?
DO SOMETHING.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.386
(beeping continues)

06:03.634 --> 06:05.696
UM... WHAT-WHAT'S--
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

06:05.696 --> 06:08.399
(ultrasound whooshing)
YOUR FATHER'S DEVELOPED
COR PULMONALE,

06:08.399 --> 06:10.401
AND HIS HEART
IS OVERLOADING.

06:10.401 --> 06:12.403
WHAT? I-I-I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.405
I THOUGHT HIS LUNGS
WERE THE PROBLEM.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.648
H-HIS LUNGS ARE PUTTING
EXTRA PRESSURE ON HIS HEART.

06:17.648 --> 06:19.980
DR. ALTMAN IS PICKING UP
THE NEW LUNGS RIGHT NOW.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.413
I'LL CALL HER AND APPRISE HER
OF THE SITUATION.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.084
WHAT SITUATION?
WHAT IS GOING ON?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.817
HIS HEART IS FAILING.

06:26.817 --> 06:28.819
AND THE DAMAGE
SEEMS PRETTY SEVERE,

06:28.819 --> 06:30.521
SO...

06:30.521 --> 06:32.563
UH, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

06:32.563 --> 06:34.094
HE'LL NEED A NEW ONE.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.827
A NEW WHAT? A NEW HEART?

06:36.827 --> 06:38.529
(whooshing stops)

06:40.771 --> 06:43.904
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE OVER HERE.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.106
I AM GOING TO CALL
DR. ALTMAN,

06:46.106 --> 06:49.940
AND, UH, UH,
I'M GONNA GET McQUEEN.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.112
DR. BAILEY,
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.615
ONLY IF WHAT YOU HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT IS MORE IMPORTANT

06:54.615 --> 06:56.947
THAN MY BEING ON TIME
FOR AN AUTOPSY.
UH, THAT'S ARGUABLE.

06:56.947 --> 06:58.449
WE'RE THROWING
TORRES AND ROBBINS

06:58.449 --> 06:59.950
A BON VOYAGE PARTY

06:59.950 --> 07:02.022
IN THE DOCTORS' LOUNGE
THIS EVENING.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.024
OH, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.
UH, I HAVE A FULL DAY.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.527
BUT I'LL TRY AND STOP BY.
WELL, THE THING IS
ALTMAN VOLUNTEERED, UH,

07:06.527 --> 07:09.700
TO PICK UP THE CUPCAKES, BUT SHE
HAD TO PICK UP LUNGS INSTEAD.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.033
AND I JUST FIGURED, SINCE YOU
ARE CLOSE TO BOTH THESE LADIES--

07:13.033 --> 07:15.035
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO TAKE TIME

07:15.035 --> 07:17.708
OUT OF MY VERY BUSY DAY
TO GO TO THE BAKERY?

07:17.708 --> 07:19.209
OR WOULD YOU PREFER

07:19.209 --> 07:21.612
THAT I RAN ON HOME
AND BAKED SOME MYSELF?

07:21.612 --> 07:23.113
NO.

07:23.113 --> 07:24.675
OF COURSE NOT.

07:24.675 --> 07:26.547
JUST AN INVITATION.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.919
UH-HUH.

07:28.919 --> 07:30.450
MARK.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.452
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT CHRISTY CORNELL'S...

07:32.452 --> 07:34.024
(sighs)
BUTT.

07:34.024 --> 07:35.455
OKAY.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.958
BUT FIRST I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT CUPCAKES.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.590
(elevator bell dings)

07:39.590 --> 07:41.932
(gasps) CALLIE.

07:41.932 --> 07:44.935
CHECK OUT ALL THE GREAT STUFF
THE KIDS IN PEDS MADE ME.

07:44.935 --> 07:47.498
THEY WANT ME TO TAKE PICTURES
OF THEIR CRAFTS IN AFRICA.

07:47.498 --> 07:48.899
OH, WOW. THAT'S AWESOME.

07:48.899 --> 07:51.101
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW OFTEN
YOU FIND YOURSELF IN NEED

07:51.101 --> 07:53.604
OF A MACARONI FACE
GLUED TO A PAPER PLATE.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.606
NO. I MEAN,
IT'S WAY BETTER THAN GAUZE,

07:55.606 --> 07:57.578
MALARIA PILLS, ANTIBIOTICS.
WELL, YOU ARE A DELIGHT
THIS MORNING.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.050
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT?

08:00.050 --> 08:01.682
UM... NO.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.854
NO, I'M JUST...

08:03.854 --> 08:06.016
(exhales and laughs)
NO.

08:06.016 --> 08:08.589
AH.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.890
TORRES, ROBBINS.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.593
HI.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HALFWAY
TO MALAWI BY NOW.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.595
YEAH, WE HAD
SOME LAST-MINUTE PAPERWORK.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.797
PLUS, I-I PROMISED THE KIDS
I'D COME AND SAY GOOD-BYE.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.800
THAT'S GOOD. THE WORK
YOU TWO WILL BE DOING THERE

08:19.800 --> 08:22.502
WILL REFLECT VERY, VERY HIGHLY
ON THIS HOSPITAL.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.675
SURE, UH...

08:24.675 --> 08:29.810
IT WAS A SURPRISE TO LEARN
THAT I'D HAVE TO REPLACE TWO,

08:29.810 --> 08:33.513
UH, EXCELLENT ATTENDINGS
AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE ONE.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
BUT THEN THAT'S
A CHIEF'S PROBLEM.

08:35.515 --> 08:40.220
NO ONE WANTS TO REALLY HEAR
A CHIEF'S PROBLEMS.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.623
IT'S A SHAME, THOUGH, TORRES.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.625
I HAD, UH...

08:44.625 --> 08:47.227
I HAD SUCH BIG PLANS FOR YOU.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.200
(elevator bell dings)
BIG PLANS.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.234
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:54.234 --> 08:55.736
IRRIGATE AND SUCTION.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.237
(suction gurgles)

08:57.237 --> 09:00.070
THERE. CLAMP, PLEASE.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.812
DR. McQUEEN,

09:01.812 --> 09:04.815
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK AT ROY HENLEY.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.917
THEY TELL ME HE'S DEVELOPED
COR PULMONALE

09:06.917 --> 09:08.919
AND CIRCULATORY COLLAPSE.
YES, SIR. THAT'S CORRECT.

09:08.919 --> 09:12.022
DID YOU PUT HIM ON DOPAMINE,
MILRINONE, AND NITRIC OXIDE?
YES, I DID.

09:12.022 --> 09:14.625
HE'S STABLE.
CRITICAL,BUT STABLE. I--

09:14.625 --> 09:17.628
WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A PATIENT
WITH REDUCED CARDIAC OUTPUT,

09:17.628 --> 09:20.661
HYPOTENSION, SINUS TACH,
AND METABOLIC ACIDOSIS?

09:20.661 --> 09:23.934
I'D INSERT
AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP.

09:23.934 --> 09:26.196
EXACTLY.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.999
I'LL BE THERE WHEN I CAN,
DR. YANG.

09:28.999 --> 09:32.673
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU NEED ME AT ALL.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.605
THANK YOU.
IRRIGATE AND SUCTION, PLEASE.

09:34.605 --> 09:37.277
(suction gurgles)

10:03.674 --> 10:05.335
YOU MUST BE DR. BAILEY.

10:05.335 --> 10:07.337
I'M DR. STANLEY,
HEAD OF PATHOLOGY.

10:07.337 --> 10:09.239
THIS MUST BE...

10:09.239 --> 10:11.241
MARY PORTMAN, 30,
MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE,

10:11.241 --> 10:13.714
CAUSE UNKNOWN.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.716
SHE CAME IN FOR A STANDARD
COLOSTOMY REVERSAL

10:15.716 --> 10:17.748
AND NEVER WOKE UP.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

10:17.748 --> 10:21.351
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
WE CAN SINK OUR TEETH INTO.

10:21.351 --> 10:22.723
(chewing)

10:22.723 --> 10:25.656
UM, I HAVE A LIST
OF POSSIBLE CAUSES

10:25.656 --> 10:28.628
I'D LIKE TO CHECK
AS WE PROCEED.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
(mouth full)
WE HAVE A SPECIFIC ORDER

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
TO THE WAY WE WORK DOWN HERE,

10:32.632 --> 10:35.706
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT WE SEE
WHEN WE SEE IT, OKAY? OKAY.
(instruments rattle)

10:35.706 --> 10:37.708
(April)
ACCORDING TO THIS CARD,

10:37.708 --> 10:39.710
THIS GUY'S GOT
A BLOWN RIGHT PUPIL,

10:39.710 --> 10:41.712
AN ATLANTOOCCIPITAL DISLOCATION,
OPEN-BOOK PELVIS,

10:41.712 --> 10:43.774
A LARGE OPEN ABDOMINAL WOUND--

10:43.774 --> 10:47.748
JEEZ!--A SUCKING CHEST WOUND
WITH SEVEN BROKEN RIBS.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.750
THIS GUY IS ALL MESSED UP.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.051
OR HE'S DEAD.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.153
AH. RIGHT. YES.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.786
MOVING ON.

10:55.786 --> 10:59.059
(indistinct conversations)

11:06.867 --> 11:10.801
(indistinct conversations
continue)

11:10.801 --> 11:12.672
CRISTINA?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.674
HEY. HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.007
OH, NOT LONG. I JUST
NEEDED SOME FRESH AIR.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.349
AND HOW'S THE PATIENT?

11:19.349 --> 11:21.852
UH, HE'S FINE. HE'S GREAT.
A COUPLE OF COMPLICATIONS,

11:21.852 --> 11:23.784
BUT YEAH, I'M HANDLING IT.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.787
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.759
IT'S, UH... CHILLY OUT HERE.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.690
(pager beeps)

11:30.690 --> 11:32.863
(beeping stops)

11:32.863 --> 11:34.965
IT'S HIM.
UM... I NEED TO--

11:34.965 --> 11:38.128
I... HAVE TO GO LOOK.

11:38.128 --> 11:40.400
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.401
CRISTINA.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.233
UH-HUH.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.375
YOUCANDO THIS.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.077
OKAY.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.739
THANKS.

11:48.739 --> 11:51.742
(indistinct conversations)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.345
GREY.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.087
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:57.087 --> 11:59.019
YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE CERTIFIED.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.292
NOW CAN YOU GO INSIDE
AND, UH, GIVE CRISTINA A HAND?

12:02.292 --> 12:05.125
WELL, WHAT DOES SHE NEED?
DID SHE ASK FOR ME?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.397
MEREDITH... PLEASE.

12:07.397 --> 12:08.728
OKAY?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.761
YEAH.
THANKS.

12:10.761 --> 12:12.732
(door opens)

12:14.334 --> 12:16.166
(door closes)

12:24.244 --> 12:27.747
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:27.747 --> 12:28.949
HEY.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.450
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.183
OWEN SENT ME.
I DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER.

12:33.183 --> 12:35.856
I'M JUST AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS.
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.487
HE WENT
INTO CARDIOGENIC SHOCK,

12:37.487 --> 12:40.090
SO I'M INSERTING
AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP

12:40.090 --> 12:42.092
AND HOPING THERE ARE
NO OTHER COMPLICATIONS

12:42.092 --> 12:44.334
BEFORE TEDDY GETS BACK.

12:44.334 --> 12:47.367
SO WE ARE WATCHING
FOR HEMOLYSIS, A GAS EMBOLISM,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.369
A BLUE LEG
FROM PERIPHERAL ISCHEMIA--

12:49.369 --> 12:51.902
OKAY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING, UH, HIS,

12:51.902 --> 12:55.906
UH, DAUGHTER IS UP IN C.C.U.,
AND SHE NEEDS AN UPDATE.

12:55.906 --> 12:57.808
OKAY.

13:02.452 --> 13:04.554
BLUE TEAM, STATUS REPORT.

13:04.554 --> 13:07.417
WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE
TO FIND NINE CASUALTIES.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.419
WE IDENTIFIED THREE
AS PRIORITY ONE,

13:09.419 --> 13:11.822
REQUIRING IMMEDIATE EVACUATION.
FOUR WERE PRIORITY TWO,

13:11.822 --> 13:13.563
ALLOWING FOR DELAYED EVAC.

13:13.563 --> 13:15.565
ONE WAS PRIORITY THREE,

13:15.565 --> 13:17.928
AND THE LAST WAS SADLY...
DEAD ON THE SCENE.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.970
NICE WORK, KEPNER.

13:19.970 --> 13:22.903
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU
NOW HAVE TWO DEAD PATIENTS.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.105
EXCUSE ME?
WELL, WHILE YOU WERE
STANDING AROUND

13:25.105 --> 13:27.577
WAITING FOR THE HELICOPTER
TO ARRIVE

13:27.577 --> 13:29.809
AND NOT KEEPING A CONSTANT EYE
ON YOUR PATIENT'S INJURY,

13:29.809 --> 13:32.312
THIS ONE DEVELOPED
A FEMORAL BLEED, BLED OUT

13:32.312 --> 13:34.945
AND IS NOW SADLY DEAD.

13:34.945 --> 13:37.147
NO, A-A FEMORAL BLEED--
THAT WASN'T ON THE CARD.

13:37.147 --> 13:39.389
REALLY?
WELL, IT'S ON THIS ONE.
(snaps fingers)

13:39.389 --> 13:41.992
O-OH, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT. THAT'S NOT FAIR.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.854
PATIENTS
DON'T SUDDENLY DIE.

13:43.854 --> 13:46.296
IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY
WHEN YOU STOP PAYING ATTENTION.

13:46.296 --> 13:49.930
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
RED TEAM, GO.
(man) THERE WERE NINE OF THEM,
BUT THAT GUY OVER THERE

13:49.930 --> 13:52.502
WAS DEAD WHEN WE GOT HERE,
SO I GUESS THAT'S EIGHT...
I'M SO SORRY, YOU GUYS.

13:52.502 --> 13:55.005
(thunder rumbling)
THOSE GUYS RIGHT THERE ARE
PRIORITY THREE.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.107
WE TAGGED THESE OVER HERE
AS PRIORITY TWO.

13:57.107 --> 13:58.438
AWESOME.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.510
(groans)
TELL ME ABOUT THE BANDAGING
ON THESE TWO.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.412
(man) PRIORITY ONES...

14:02.412 --> 14:05.515
(whirring)

14:05.515 --> 14:07.017
(turns off saw)

14:07.017 --> 14:10.320
RIGHT. THE RESERVATION'S UNDER
STANLEY. JENNIFER STANLEY.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.883
4 PEOPLE FOR 8:00.

14:12.883 --> 14:14.885
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

14:14.885 --> 14:17.928
WHY WOULD 8 PEOPLE
WANT TO HAVE DINNER AT 4:00?

14:17.928 --> 14:20.090
(Sia) ♪ SEVEN GOOD DEEDS,
YOU'RE A MAN OF STRENGTH ♪

14:20.090 --> 14:22.392
DR. STANLEY, THE--THE CLOTS

14:22.392 --> 14:24.965
COULD INDICATE
A PULMONARY EMBOLUS.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.197
LET ME TALK TO YOUR MANAGER.
DR. STANLEY.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.399
WHAT'S UP?
I WAS ASKING ABOUT
THOSE BLOOD CLOTS.

14:29.399 --> 14:33.203
NOW COULDN'T A PULMONARY EMBOLUS
HAVE LED TO HER DEATH?

14:33.203 --> 14:34.975
THOSE ARE POSTMORTEM CLOTS,
DR. BAILEY.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.047
PERFECTLY NORMAL.
HELLO. HI.

14:37.047 --> 14:39.549
YES, THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE
WITH MY DINNER RESERVATION.

14:39.549 --> 14:43.914
(laughs) "BIG PLANS."
(deep voice) "BIG PLANS."

14:43.914 --> 14:45.885
(normal voice) YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.559
I'VE GOT BIG PLANS MYSELF--
GREAT BIG AFRICAN PLANS.

14:49.559 --> 14:52.562
YEAH, YOU DO.
YEAH. I DON'T NEED
TO GROW CARTILAGE IN A LAB.

14:52.562 --> 14:55.195
I'LL BE BUILDING BONES
FROM DIRT.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.928
I'LL BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO
CREATE UNBREAKABLE JOINTS

14:57.928 --> 14:59.599
OUT OF BLOOD DIAMONDS.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.972
I'LL BE--I'LL BE MAKING
ARTIFICIAL LIMBS

15:01.972 --> 15:04.174
OUT OF ELEPHANT IVORY.
(elevator bell dings)

15:04.174 --> 15:07.037
I'M PRETTY SURE A COUPLE
OF THOSE WOULD BE FROWNED UPON

15:07.037 --> 15:09.439
BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY.
OH, WHATEVER. SCIENCE ISN'T
ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.541
(thunder rumbling)

15:11.541 --> 15:13.543
THE HELICOPTER HAS TO BE
GETTING HERE SOON.

15:13.543 --> 15:16.146
IT'S BEEN THREE HOURS.
JUST--JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.148
HERE. TAKE THESE.
RIGHT? RIGHT, DR. HUNT?

15:18.148 --> 15:20.450
THE HELICOPTER
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE?

15:20.450 --> 15:21.952
NICE RAIN GEAR, KAREV.

15:21.952 --> 15:25.225
SHOULDN'T YOU BE MORE CONCERNED
WITH YOUR PATIENT STAYING DRY?

15:25.225 --> 15:28.558
YEAH, WELL, HE'S A DUMMY,
AND I'M A PERSON, SO...

15:28.558 --> 15:30.560
YOU KNOW, A DRY PATIENT
IS LESS LIKELY TO DIE

15:30.560 --> 15:32.932
OF HYPOTHERMIA OR SHOCK.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.405
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

15:35.405 --> 15:37.407
ALEX, YOU CAN'T
BREAK THE RULES LIKE THAT.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.409
THAT'S UNSANCTIONED USE
OF A TRASH BAG.

15:39.409 --> 15:41.341
YOU'RE GONNA MESS UP
OUR CERTIFICATION.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.343
OH, YOU NEED TO RELAX.
THIS WHOLE UPTIGHT THING?

15:43.343 --> 15:46.346
THIS IS WHY
YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.
HEY.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.519
OKAY, THIS IS WHY
YOU HAVE ONE FRIEND.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.221
GIVE ME THAT BACK!

15:51.221 --> 15:52.722
ARE YOU CRAZY?

15:52.722 --> 15:54.524
THERE YOU GO, LITTLE GUY.

15:54.524 --> 15:57.027
NO HYPOTHERMIA FOR YOU.

15:57.027 --> 15:58.458
(grunts)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.190
EVERYONE.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.332
GREEN TEAM'S PATIENTS
ARE ALL DEAD.

16:02.332 --> 16:05.735
ONLY RED TEAM
AND BLUE TEAM REMAIN.

16:05.735 --> 16:08.298
WHOA. YOU SEE A HELICOPTER?

16:08.298 --> 16:10.170
TAKE A KNEE,
LEARN SOMETHING.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.972
TAKE A KNEE?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.145
HE'S GONNA SCALP THEM.

16:15.145 --> 16:17.177
WE'RE IN "APOCALYPSE NOW,"
AND WE'RE GONNA GET SCALPED.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.110
THAT, RIGHT THERE.
SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.511
(mutters)

16:21.511 --> 16:22.982
(sighs)

16:22.982 --> 16:26.016
OKAY, I-I SWEAR.
I'M--I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

16:26.016 --> 16:28.658
I JUST--IF--IF DR. ALTMAN
DOESN'T GET THIS NEW HEART,

16:28.658 --> 16:31.461
IS THAT, LIKE, GAME OVER
ON THE LUNG TRANSPLANT?

16:31.461 --> 16:33.463
UH, THERE ARE
A VARIETY OF FACTORS.

16:33.463 --> 16:37.167
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I CAN GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU.

16:37.167 --> 16:40.230
FINE. UH, WHERE ARE WE
ON THE HEART?

16:40.230 --> 16:42.072
AGAIN, NOT SURE.

16:42.072 --> 16:45.075
DR. ALTMAN SHOULD BE CALLING
WITH AN UPDATE VERY SOON.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.776
OKAY.
UH, WHEN CAN I SEE HIM?

16:46.776 --> 16:49.179
I HAVE TO CHECK
WITH DR. YANG.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.680
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A--

16:50.680 --> 16:53.043
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A WEALTH
OF INFORMATION, AREN'T YOU?

16:53.043 --> 16:55.085
I'M SORRY. I'M NEW
TO YOUR FATHER'S CASE,

16:55.085 --> 16:57.547
AND DR. YANG IS--
I CALLED HIM ROY.

16:57.547 --> 16:59.549
I DECIDED TO DO THAT
ON THE DRIVE OVER

16:59.549 --> 17:02.322
'CAUSE I HADN'T SEEN HIM
IN 20 YEARS,

17:02.322 --> 17:06.426
AND I WANT TO BLAME HIM
FOR THAT.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.199
I DO BLAME HIM FOR THAT.

17:09.199 --> 17:11.661
EXCEPT...

17:11.661 --> 17:14.334
HE TRIED.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.766
HE TRIED TO BE...
(sniffles)

17:16.766 --> 17:18.768
MY DAD IN THE BEGINNING.

17:18.768 --> 17:22.672
AND... I COULDN'T FORGIVE HIM
FOR LEAVING MY MOM.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.646
AND THEN HE STOPPED TRYING.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.119
(voice breaking) AND...

17:29.119 --> 17:31.121
I HAVE TWINS. THEY'RE 3.

17:31.121 --> 17:33.253
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE KNOWS THAT.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.155
I NEVER TOLD HIM.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.157
AND THEN...

17:37.157 --> 17:39.629
AND THEN I WALKED IN THERE...

17:39.629 --> 17:42.332
AND I CALLED HIM ROY.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.536
I CALLED MY DAD ROY.

17:46.536 --> 17:48.338
AND I JUST...

17:48.338 --> 17:50.200
I NEED FOR THAT

17:50.200 --> 17:52.842
TO NOT BE THE LAST THING
HE HEARS FROM ME.

17:52.842 --> 17:55.245
PLEASE.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.679
THE DAUGHTER REALLY NEEDS
TO TALK TO YOU.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.112
SHE HAS TOO MANY QUESTIONS
THAT I CAN'T ANSWER.

18:02.112 --> 18:04.083
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
READING HIS CHART?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.186
CRISTINA, IF YOU WANT TO BE
PISSED AT ME, THAT'S FINE.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.658
BUT DON'T--
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS RIGHT NOW,

18:08.658 --> 18:10.320
'CAUSE I'M KINDA BUSY HERE.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.691
CRAP.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.193
(sighs)

18:22.172 --> 18:24.434
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, GET HIM ON ECMO.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.136
THAT SHOULD KEEP HIM ALIVE

18:26.136 --> 18:28.138
UNTIL I CAN GET BACK
WITH THESE LUNGS.

18:28.138 --> 18:30.280
THERE IS A SHOT THAT
ONCE WE GET THEM IN,

18:30.280 --> 18:32.712
the heart damage will reverse
without the excess pressure.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.415
TEDDY SAYS
WE NEED TO GET HIM ON ECMO.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.417
OKAY, APPARENTLY, UH,
CRISTINA'S ON IT.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.150
GREY...

18:40.150 --> 18:41.451
how's she doing?

18:41.451 --> 18:43.793
UH, SHE IS DOING GREAT.
SHE'S DOING GREAT.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.625
Good, good.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.299
(speaking indistinctly)

18:49.299 --> 18:52.202
INTESTINES SHOW
A WELL-HEALED ANASTOMOSIS

18:52.202 --> 18:54.404
WITH NO EVIDENCE
OF INFECTION,

18:54.404 --> 18:58.438
INFLAMMATION, OR NECROSIS.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.441
I THINK THIS IS AS GOOD
A PLACE AS ANY TO CALL LUNCH.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.514
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LUNCH?
WELL, WE HAVE TO CHECK

19:04.514 --> 19:06.676
THE ADRENAL GLANDS
AND THE KIDNEYS.

19:06.676 --> 19:09.549
WHAT IF THE THYROID
SHOWS PATHOLOGY?
DON'T WORRY.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.182
THOSE KIDNEYS AREN'T GOING
ANYWHERE ON THEIR OWN.

19:12.182 --> 19:14.654
YES, I'M AWARE,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.656
BUT MICROSCOPIC
PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES

19:16.656 --> 19:18.628
ARE HARDER TO INTERPRET

19:18.628 --> 19:20.390
ONCE THE ORGANS
START DECOMPOSING.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.532
WE'LL ONLY BE GONE
45 MINUTES. THEY'LL KEEP.

19:22.532 --> 19:24.534
STILL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S RIGHT--

19:24.534 --> 19:27.297
OKAY, DR. BAILEY,
I'LL SEE YOU IN 45 MINUTES.

19:27.297 --> 19:29.339
(clipboard rattles,
door opens)

19:29.339 --> 19:31.271
(Lexie) I DON'T KNOW.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.273
THEY'RE CHOCOLATY LOOKING
WITH SPRINKLES.
WHERE'D YOU GET 'EM?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.275
AT THAT GROCERY STORE
DOWN THE STREET.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.277
THIS ISN'T A BABY SHOWER
FOR SOME NURSE

19:37.277 --> 19:39.279
WHO COULDN'T
KEEP HER KNEES TOGETHER, GREY.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.281
TORRES AND ROBBINS DESERVE
BETTER THAN OFF-BRAND CRAP.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.913
I'M NOT AN ERRAND GIRL. OKAY?
I'M A DOCTOR WITH A PATIENT

19:43.913 --> 19:47.217
WHO'S ABOUT TO MAKE
A GIANT BUTT-SHAPED MISTAKE.
THAT'S NOT FOR YOU TO SAY.

19:47.217 --> 19:49.519
OKAY, WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO.
THE ONLY REASON A WOMAN

19:49.519 --> 19:52.262
DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO
HER BODY IS TO IMPRESS A GUY.

19:52.262 --> 19:54.264
OKAY, SURE, IT STARTS
WITH A GIANT BUTT, AND THEN

19:54.264 --> 19:56.266
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GIVING UP HER FRIENDS,

19:56.266 --> 19:58.268
SHE'S MOVING IN WITH HIM
BEFORE SHE'S EVEN READY,

19:58.268 --> 20:00.270
AND IF SHE'S NOT CAREFUL,
SHE'LL FIND HERSELF

20:00.270 --> 20:02.302
A 26-YEAR-OLD STEPMOTHER

20:02.302 --> 20:04.304
TO THE PREGNANT DAUGHTER
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.306
AND THEN SHE'S SINGLE,
DYEING HER HAIR A NEW COLOR.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.308
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S REALLY
HARD TO MANAGE YOUR ROOTS

20:08.308 --> 20:10.440
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED
TO THE PSYCH WARD.
PSYCH WARD?

20:10.440 --> 20:13.212
(exhales deeply)

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
IT HAPPENS.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.294
(sighs) GREAT.
YOU'RE IN HERE.

20:24.294 --> 20:26.296
NOW WHERE CAN I SULK?

20:26.296 --> 20:29.299
OH, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.
THAT'S ALL I'M DOING.

20:29.299 --> 20:30.600
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.761
(sighs)

20:31.761 --> 20:33.263
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

20:33.263 --> 20:36.336
I HAVE BEEN DOWN
IN THE MORGUE ALL MORNING

20:36.336 --> 20:39.339
TRYING TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE
OF DEATH FOR MARY PORTMAN,

20:39.339 --> 20:42.312
WHO SURVIVED THE HORRORS
OF GARY CLARK

20:42.312 --> 20:45.715
ONLY TO DIE FROM A SURGERY
THAT I PERFORM EVERY DAY.

20:45.715 --> 20:47.717
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

20:47.717 --> 20:49.719
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO MARY'S HUSBAND,

20:49.719 --> 20:51.421
TO FIND SOME ANSWERS TODAY.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.883
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS
IMPORTANT TO THE PATHOLOGIST

20:53.883 --> 20:55.925
WHO IS LEADING THE AUTOPSY?

20:55.925 --> 20:59.289
OH, HER DINNER RESERVATIONS
AND HER LUNCH BREAK--

20:59.289 --> 21:00.790
BASICALLY FOOD--

21:00.790 --> 21:02.862
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
TO THIS PATHOLOGIST.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.364
(sighs deeply)

21:04.364 --> 21:06.265
(crunching)

21:06.265 --> 21:07.567
FEELING BETTER?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.399
NO. NOT REALLY, NO.

21:09.399 --> 21:11.741
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

21:11.741 --> 21:14.444
OH, I'M JUST TRYING TO WRITE
THIS GRANT PROPOSAL.

21:14.444 --> 21:15.745
WHY ONLY TRYING?

21:15.745 --> 21:17.747
BECAUSE THE MORE
YOU RESEARCH ALZHEIMER'S,

21:17.747 --> 21:19.449
THE MORE DEPRESSING IT GETS.

21:19.449 --> 21:21.451
AND THEN WHEN YOU INCLUDE
THE EARLY ONSET,

21:21.451 --> 21:23.383
THE TYPE THAT ELLIS GREY
SUFFERED FROM,

21:23.383 --> 21:25.455
IT JUST GETS WORSE.

21:25.455 --> 21:27.717
THERE'S A WOMAN IN ENGLAND.
SHE'S 32.

21:27.717 --> 21:30.390
SHE CAN'T RECOGNIZE
HER 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

21:30.390 --> 21:33.663
IT'S JUST... TERRIFYING.

21:35.425 --> 21:38.398
THIS PATHOLOGIST ALSO
CHEWS GUM WHILE SHE WORKS.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.400
OH, MY GOD.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.503
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.504
(crunches)

21:44.504 --> 21:46.005
THANK YOU.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.308
(Mark) CHRISTY.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.412
YES.
DR. GREY IS CONCERNED
THAT, UH, YOU MIGHT BE

21:52.412 --> 21:54.844
GOING THROUGH WITH THIS SURGERY
FOR THE WRONG REASONS,

21:54.844 --> 21:56.846
THAT YOU MIGHT BE TRYING
TO PLEASE SOMEONE

21:56.846 --> 21:59.949
WHO PREFERS A MORE...

21:59.949 --> 22:02.492
ROBUST BODY TYPE.

22:02.492 --> 22:04.524
MM. DR. GREY.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.657
I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY.

22:07.657 --> 22:09.659
BUT EVEN THROUGH
YOUR LAB COAT,

22:09.659 --> 22:11.661
I CAN TELL,
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING ASS.

22:11.661 --> 22:14.033
AND WITH AN ASS LIKE THAT,
I BET YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

22:14.033 --> 22:16.035
TO FIND THE PERFECT PAIR
OF JEANS,

22:16.035 --> 22:18.368
JEANS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE

22:18.368 --> 22:21.110
YOU'RE THE SEXIEST PERSON TO
EVER PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS.

22:21.110 --> 22:23.473
AND I ENVY THAT,
'CAUSE I NEVER HAVE.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.515
EVERY PAIR HANGS OFF ME...

22:25.515 --> 22:27.346
UNLESS I SHOP
IN THE BOYS' DEPARTMENT.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.348
AND I HAVE TRIED
GAINING WEIGHT, DR. GREY.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.521
IT TURNS OUT, I'M A PERSON

22:31.521 --> 22:34.023
WHOSE FAT GOES STRAIGHT TO
MY UPPER ARMS AND MY BOOBS,

22:34.023 --> 22:37.557
WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARD
FOR ME TO WEAR A SUNDRESS,

22:37.557 --> 22:41.391
WHICH IS ALL I CAN WEAR,
BECAUSE JEANS DON'T FIT.

22:41.391 --> 22:45.495
SO, DR. GREY, I AM GETTING
A BIG, JUICY,

22:45.495 --> 22:47.366
EASY-TO-GRAB-ON-TO ASS,

22:47.366 --> 22:50.369
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE,
I AM DOING IT JUST FOR ME.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.073
AND I'M TELLING YOU...
I CAN'T WAIT.

22:58.107 --> 23:00.980
YOU ARE SO NICE.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.883
OKAY, RED TEAM'S PATIENTS
HAVE ALL DIED.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.086
ONLY BLUE TEAM REMAINS.
(doctors groan)

23:07.086 --> 23:10.720
KEEP AN EYE ON KAREV. THAT'S
WHAT RESOURCEFUL LOOKS LIKE.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.623
(doctors speaking indistinctly)
GOOD EFFORT, AVERY.

23:13.623 --> 23:16.966
BUT THIS INCISION
YOU MADE IS TOO WIDE.

23:16.966 --> 23:20.770
YOU LACERATED
THE SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERIES.
WELL, I JUST--

23:20.770 --> 23:23.633
MOVE ON.
DAMN IT!

23:23.633 --> 23:25.975
I HEAR IT.
I HEAR THE HELICOPTER.
YOU WHAT?

23:25.975 --> 23:28.778
I-I-I-I HEAR IT!
I HEAR IT!
(Alex) OH, WAKE UP!

23:28.778 --> 23:31.781
YOU DON'T HEAR THE HELICOPTER
BECAUSE "A," IT'S IMAGINARY,

23:31.781 --> 23:35.114
AND "B," THE IMAGINARY
HELICOPTER IS NEVER COMING!

23:35.114 --> 23:38.187
HUNT'STRYING TO BREAK US,
TRYING TO TEACH US

23:38.187 --> 23:41.851
SOME B.S. LESSON ABOUT HOW
TRAUMA ISN'T FAIR OR WHATEVER.

23:41.851 --> 23:44.794
WE'RE NOT DONE UNTIL HE SAYS
THESE DUMMIES ARE DEAD.

23:44.794 --> 23:47.597
THE END!
THAT'S NOT TRUE! NO!

23:47.597 --> 23:49.599
YOU ARE WRONG!

23:49.599 --> 23:52.802
(rainfall grows louder)

23:52.802 --> 23:55.505
SCREW THIS. I'M DONE.

23:55.505 --> 23:57.707
WHAT?

23:57.707 --> 23:59.939
(April) JACKSON!

23:59.939 --> 24:02.041
AVERY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YOU--UGH!

24:02.041 --> 24:04.574
AVERY.
AVERY, GET BACK HERE.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.776
NO!
NO?

24:06.776 --> 24:09.078
(pants)

24:09.078 --> 24:11.020
NO, SIR.

24:11.020 --> 24:14.153
(thunder rumbles,
door closes)

24:25.464 --> 24:27.466
(Jennifer)
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.468
CLOSE HER UP
AND CALL IT A DAY.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.572
AREN'T WE GONNA GET
A SAMPLE FROM THE BRAIN?
SURE,

24:32.572 --> 24:35.605
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, WHEN IT'S
HAD A CHANCE TO FIRM UP

24:35.605 --> 24:38.247
IN THE FORMALIN.
OH, IT'S POSSIBLE
TO CUT THE BRAIN FRESH.

24:38.247 --> 24:40.249
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT THE MOMENT

24:40.249 --> 24:43.513
YOU CUT INTO A FRESH BRAIN,
IT SLIDES APART LIKE JELL-O.

24:43.513 --> 24:45.555
IF YOU DON'T WANT RISK THAT,

24:45.555 --> 24:49.088
YOU PUT IT IN FORMALIN
AND WAIT TWO WEEKS.
I-I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB, BUT YOU--

24:49.088 --> 24:51.591
NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

24:51.591 --> 24:53.593
AND I'M TRYING VERY HARD
NOT TO HOLD IT AGAINST YOU.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.725
THIS IS WHAT I DO,
ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.

24:55.725 --> 24:57.927
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
I FAILED MEDICAL SCHOOL?

24:57.927 --> 25:01.230
IS THAT YOUR ACTUAL BELIEF,
THAT PEOPLE BECOME PATHOLOGISTS

25:01.230 --> 25:03.502
BECAUSE THEY FAIL
TO BECOME SURGEONS?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.535
THE AUTOPSY WAS INCONCLUSIVE,
DR. BAILEY.

25:05.535 --> 25:09.779
AND BELIEVE ME, I HATE THAT
AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.189
HE'S STABLE?

25:20.189 --> 25:21.691
HE'S CRITICAL.

25:21.691 --> 25:24.694
I HAVE TO KEEP, UH, CHECKING
HIS ACID-BASE BALANCE,

25:24.694 --> 25:26.556
BUT, YES, HE'S STABLE-ISH
FOR NOW.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.558
GREAT.
SO LET ME TAKE OVER HERE,

25:28.558 --> 25:31.530
AND YOU CAN GO
GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AN UPDATE.
NO, YOU GO.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.532
UM, TELL HER THAT HIS, UH,
BLOOD PRESSURE IS COMING UP--

25:33.532 --> 25:35.835
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU.
WELL,
HE NEEDS TO BE MONITORED.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.567
WELL, I CAN DO THAT.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.069
OKAY. SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO HEAR AN UPDATE FROM ME.

25:40.069 --> 25:42.872
ALL SHE WANTS IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT I KNOW THAT SHE'S AFRAID,

25:42.872 --> 25:44.874
AND I CAN'T
HEAR THAT RIGHT NOW...

25:44.874 --> 25:47.577
(voice breaking) BECAUSE I AM
SCARED ENOUGH AS IT IS.

25:47.577 --> 25:49.579
I WAS SCARED WHEN HE CODED.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.581
I'M SCARED
NOW THAT HE'S STABLE.

25:51.581 --> 25:53.583
I'M SCARED
WALKING ACROSS THE LOBBY.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.655
I AM SCARED ALL THE TIME.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.556
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.790
YOUCANNOT HELP! OKAY?
YOUCAN'T HELP ME.
DR. ALTMAN'S 30 MINUTES OUT.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.633
WE NEED TO GET HIM
TO THE O.R.

26:03.633 --> 26:05.635
(snaps gloves)
DR. GREY CAN HELP WITH THAT.

26:05.635 --> 26:09.098
CRISTINA...

26:11.701 --> 26:13.673
(laughing and speaking
indistinctly)

26:13.673 --> 26:15.574
(Mark, Lexie and Richard)
BON VOYAGE!

26:15.574 --> 26:18.007
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.
IT'S A GOING AWAY PARTY.

26:18.007 --> 26:19.779
YOU GUYS.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.681
UM... THIS IS A PARTY?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.352
(thunder rumbles,
siren whoops)

26:23.352 --> 26:26.285
IT'S... A BUSY DAY.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.287
NO. YEAH, I MEAN, I'M...

26:28.287 --> 26:30.760
I'VE JUST BEEN AT THIS HOSPITAL
SINCE RESIDENCY.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.762
BUT, UH...

26:32.762 --> 26:34.764
IF PEOPLE ARE TOO BUSY
TO SEE ME OFF,

26:34.764 --> 26:36.766
THEN THEY'RE TOO--
THEY'RE TOO BUSY.

26:36.766 --> 26:38.167
CALLIE...

26:38.167 --> 26:40.169
WELL, IT'S HARD
TO BLAME 'EM, TORRES.

26:40.169 --> 26:42.601
I MEAN, WE'RE DOWN
A COUPLE OF ATTENDINGS.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.705
THINGS ARE GOING TO BE BUSIER
ALL AROUND FOR A WHILE.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.738
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU COULD
FIND THE TIME, CHIEF...

26:48.738 --> 26:52.181
WITH ALL YOUR CHIEF PROBLEMS
AND BIG PLANS...

26:52.181 --> 26:54.744
WHICH WERE WHAT EXACTLY?

26:54.744 --> 26:59.689
NOW WHY WOULD I JUST
GIVE AWAY MY GOOD IDEAS?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.756
OH, HE'S JUST CRABBY.
HE'S MESSING WITH YOUR HEAD.

27:06.756 --> 27:10.199
YEAH, WELL,
I'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL I?

27:13.963 --> 27:17.636
(clears throat)

27:17.636 --> 27:19.138
THANK YOU, BOTH, SO MUCH.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.171
UM, I-I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
FINISH UP SOME PACKING.

27:22.171 --> 27:25.274
SO I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA GO.

27:25.274 --> 27:26.776
GOOD LUCK.

27:26.776 --> 27:28.778
GIVE 'EM HELL.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.923
(exhales deeply)

27:33.923 --> 27:35.925
I-I DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME YET.

27:35.925 --> 27:40.659
YOU WANT TO SEE US
GIVE A LADY A REALLY BIG ASS?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.832
OH, MY GOD, YES.

27:42.832 --> 27:45.034
(indistinct conversations)

27:50.339 --> 27:52.041
SIR!

27:52.041 --> 27:55.204
YOU SAID THE HELICOPTER
WAS GONNA BE HERE HOURS AGO,

27:55.204 --> 27:57.676
AND IT'S NOT HERE,
AND I'M NOT COMPLAINING,

27:57.676 --> 27:59.709
BUT WHERE IS IT?

27:59.709 --> 28:02.181
WELL, THE RAIN'S
STILL PRETTY BAD.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.714
PROBABLY GOT CAUGHT
IN A HAIL STORM.

28:04.714 --> 28:06.786
(panting) NO!

28:06.786 --> 28:08.788
NO! I KNOW WHAT THAT CARD
IS GONNA SAY.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.721
IT'S GONNA SAY
HE HAS CARDIAC TAMPONADE

28:11.721 --> 28:14.293
WITH ASSOCIATED HYPOTENSION
AND BRADYCARDIA, BUT HE CAN'T,

28:14.293 --> 28:16.195
'CAUSE I ALREADY DID
A PERICARDIOCENTESIS

28:16.195 --> 28:18.027
AND BOLUSED HIM
WITH I.V. FLUIDS.

28:18.027 --> 28:19.698
SHE'S RIGHT.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.130
WHAT DO I DO? DO I--

28:21.130 --> 28:22.932
KAREV!

28:22.932 --> 28:24.974
GRAB HIS FEET.

28:24.974 --> 28:26.435
(grunts)

28:26.435 --> 28:28.307
THE PATIENT!

28:28.307 --> 28:30.740
COME ON!
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.783
(Alex) SON OF A BITCH.
THAT'S AWESOME!

YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

28:33.783 --> 28:36.816
THIS AMBULANCE
IS NOT IN PLAY.
OH, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING STUFF UP,

28:36.816 --> 28:38.918
WHICH I CAN DO, TOO!
AND I SAY IT IS IN PLAY.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.950
CAN'T FIT NINE PATIENTS
ON AN AMBULANCE.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.793
BUT TWO WILL FIT JUST FINE.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.925
SEVEN OF MY PATIENTS
MAY HAVE DIED TODAY,

28:45.925 --> 28:48.828
BUT THESE TWO WON'T!
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GET THEM

28:48.828 --> 28:50.930
ON THIS AMBULANCE,

28:50.930 --> 28:53.933

AND NO LONGER RUNS.
THERE ARE KEYS IN THE IGNITION,
SO LET'S SEE.

29:07.817 --> 29:09.849

29:09.849 --> 29:12.852
LOOKS LIKE I GOT TRIPLE-A. HA!

29:12.852 --> 29:15.754
APPARENTLY THEY COULD GET HERE
WHEN THE HELICOPTER COULDN'T.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.056

29:17.056 --> 29:19.758

29:40.479 --> 29:42.551
STILL HYPOTENSIVE
DESPITE TWO LARGE-BORE I.V.s

29:42.551 --> 29:44.413
STARTED IN THE FIELD.

29:44.413 --> 29:46.816
ALL RIGHT, KEPNER.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.858
WE NEED A FULL WORKUP
AND LIKELY A THORACOTOMY.

29:48.858 --> 29:51.220
I SUSPECT ACTIVE BLEEDING
IN THE CHEST.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.423
WILL YOU TELL US WE WON,

IT'S NOT A CONTEST.
KAREV!

29:56.425 --> 29:59.228

THAT THERE'S A ROOM AVAILABLE.
WILL DO.

DR. STANLEY REFUSES TO CUT
INTO MARY'S BRAIN

30:36.305 --> 30:39.909
WITHOUT LETTING IT SET
IN FIXATIVE FOR TWO WEEKS.

30:39.909 --> 30:42.411
LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO GO OVER HER HEAD.

30:42.411 --> 30:45.274
I CAN'T DO THAT.
SHE'S RIGHT.

30:45.274 --> 30:48.277
I CAN'T SPEED UP THE PROCESS
ANY MORE THAN SHE CAN.

30:48.277 --> 30:50.980
THAT ISNOTWHAT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO SAY.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.282
LOOK, MIRANDA,
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN...
(sighs)

30:53.282 --> 30:55.885
A VERY PERSONAL LOSS FOR YOU,

30:55.885 --> 30:57.927
BUT YOU NEED TO LET IT GO.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.093
(voice breaking) I HAVE TO GO
AND TELL MARY'S HUSBAND

31:04.093 --> 31:06.966
THAT I DON'T KNOW
WHY HIS WIFE DIED,

31:06.966 --> 31:08.637
THAT I CAN'T ANSWER

31:08.637 --> 31:11.300
THE ONE QUESTION
HE HAS TO ASK.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.302
AND I CAN'T ANSWER
THAT QUESTION

31:13.302 --> 31:16.045
BECAUSE MEDICINE--
BECAUSE SCIENCE IS FAILING ME.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.047
(normal voice)
THAT I TAKE PERSONALLY.

31:18.047 --> 31:19.448
THAT I CAN'T ACCEPT.

31:19.448 --> 31:21.450
AND DON'T YOU DARE STAND THERE

31:21.450 --> 31:23.452
AND TALK TO ME
ABOUT LETTING THINGS GO.

31:23.452 --> 31:25.454
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT

31:25.454 --> 31:28.117
THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS WIFE
GETTING ALZHEIMER'S

31:28.117 --> 31:32.061
LONG ENOUGH
TO WRITE A DAMN ESSAY.

31:32.061 --> 31:34.994
(door opens)

31:34.994 --> 31:36.966
(door closes)

31:43.102 --> 31:45.104
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WITH THE PATIENT?

31:45.104 --> 31:47.036
HE'S PREPPED
AND IN THE O.R.

31:47.036 --> 31:50.039
AND NOW
YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME.
PLEASE JUST GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

31:52.541 --> 31:53.983
CRISTINA.

31:53.983 --> 31:56.545
(chuckles)

31:58.617 --> 32:00.950
HOW ARE YOU FINE?

32:00.950 --> 32:03.622
HOW ARE YOU
JUST COMPLETELY FINE?

32:03.622 --> 32:05.624
(voice breaking)
I'M RUINED, OKAY?

32:05.624 --> 32:07.626
I AM DEAD. I AM WRECKED.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.060
AND YOU'RE JUST WALKING AROUND,
WHAT, BABYSITTING ME?

32:11.060 --> 32:13.632
AS IF YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH
THE SAME THING, TOO?

32:13.632 --> 32:16.005
WHY AREYOUOKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

32:16.005 --> 32:18.537
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU--YOU WERE
THERE, TOO, YOU KNOW?

32:18.537 --> 32:20.539
YOU WERE THERE, TOO,
WITH YOUR SAD EYES,

32:20.539 --> 32:23.072
SCREAMING AT ME
TO SAVE HIS LIFE...
I WASN'T--

32:23.072 --> 32:25.144
YOU KNOW, THEN TELLING
THE GUY TO SHOOT YOU

32:25.144 --> 32:27.646
AND NOT GIVING A CRAP ABOUT
YOURSELF OR YOUR PREGNANCY.
CRISTINA--

32:27.646 --> 32:29.648
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE!
ANDYOUDID THAT!

32:29.648 --> 32:32.081
IF IT WAS ANYONE ELSE
ON THE TABLE,

32:32.081 --> 32:34.383
IF IT WAS ANYONE ELSE STANDING
THERE, I WOULD'VE WALKED AWAY!
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE--

32:34.383 --> 32:37.386
I COULD'VE WALKED AWAY,
AND THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE!
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED--

32:37.386 --> 32:41.430
(helicopter blades whirring)

32:47.736 --> 32:51.340
(whirring continues)

32:54.603 --> 32:57.546
WALK WITH ME, DR. YANG.
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

32:57.546 --> 33:00.379
(whirring continues)

33:09.158 --> 33:11.460
NOW WHO AM I GONNA
TALK TO ABOUT WOMEN?

33:11.460 --> 33:13.162
YOU HAVE DEREK.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.164
HE'S MARRIED
AND SELF-SATISFIED.

33:15.164 --> 33:16.465
IT'S IRRITATING.

33:16.465 --> 33:18.067
(laughs)

33:18.067 --> 33:20.299
WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS E-MAIL.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.000
(sighs)

33:22.000 --> 33:23.332
(thunder rumbling)

33:23.332 --> 33:25.334
WHAT?

33:25.334 --> 33:27.776
IT'S NOT MY PLACE.
I DON'T...

33:27.776 --> 33:29.278
(inhales sharply)

33:29.278 --> 33:31.140
SAY IT.

33:31.140 --> 33:34.313
(sighs)

33:34.313 --> 33:37.046
I GIVE A LOT OF BOOB JOBS.

33:37.046 --> 33:40.189
OKAY. (laughs) NOT WHERE
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING.

33:40.189 --> 33:43.792
BUT I ALSO REVERSE
A LOT OF BOOB JOBS.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.794
WOMEN COME TO ME A YEAR,

33:45.794 --> 33:49.458
TWO YEARS AFTER
THEY'VE HAD WORK DONE...

33:49.458 --> 33:53.162
AND THEY'RE TOTALLY UNHAPPY
WITH THE DECISION THEY'VE MADE.

33:53.162 --> 33:56.335
TODAY, THOUGH,
YOU WATCHED ME GIVE A LADY

33:56.335 --> 33:58.036
A REALLY BIG ASS,

33:58.036 --> 34:00.709
AND--AND I'M NOT THE SLIGHTEST
BIT WORRIED ABOUT IT,

34:00.709 --> 34:02.771
BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT,

34:02.771 --> 34:05.074
THERE'S NO BOYFRIEND
PRESSURING HER.

34:05.074 --> 34:08.077
IT WASN'T ABOUT ANYONE ELSE.
IT WAS FOR HER.

34:08.077 --> 34:10.549
AS YOUR FRIEND,
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

34:10.549 --> 34:12.551
YOU SOUND AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE SOMEONE

34:12.551 --> 34:14.223
WHO'S GETTING DOUBLE D's

34:14.223 --> 34:16.555
JUST 'CAUSE HER GIRLFRIEND
LIKES A BIG RACK.

34:19.328 --> 34:21.430
BY "BIG RACK," I MEAN AFRICA.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.237
I LOVE HER, MARK.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.139
I KNOW YOU DO.

34:30.139 --> 34:32.541
BUT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT...

34:32.541 --> 34:35.073
HOW TO LOVE AFRICA, TOO.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.347
(sighs deeply)

34:50.419 --> 34:53.662
(thunder rumbles)

34:53.662 --> 34:55.164
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

34:55.164 --> 34:56.625
AVERY.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.297
HEY.
(exhales)

34:58.297 --> 35:00.829
HEY. YOU DON'T GET TO JUST
WALK AWAY WHEN I'M TEACHING.

35:00.829 --> 35:03.101
TWO OF MY FRIENDS
DIED DURING THE SHOOTING,

35:03.101 --> 35:04.573
SO... THANKS.

35:04.573 --> 35:07.636
I DON'T NEED LESSONS
ON HOW UNFAIR TRAUMA IS.

35:13.542 --> 35:16.845
I LOST DOZENS OF FRIENDS
IN THE FIELD... DOZENS.

35:16.845 --> 35:19.218
AND I HAVE NEVER--NEVER--

35:19.218 --> 35:22.191
USED THEM
AS AN EXCUSE TO QUIT.

35:22.191 --> 35:23.692
YOU'RE A DOCTOR, AVERY.

35:23.692 --> 35:25.894
THAT DOESN'T STOP JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE UP AGAINST A WALL.

35:25.894 --> 35:28.397
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BE A DOCTOR

35:28.397 --> 35:30.559
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH

35:30.559 --> 35:32.561
AND NO MATTER WHAT TOOLS
YOU DON'T HAVE.

35:32.561 --> 35:34.903
THAT IS THE LESSON
YOU NEED TO LEARN.

35:34.903 --> 35:36.405
YOU DON'T GET TO QUIT.

35:36.405 --> 35:39.268
SO IF I NEED TO DRAG YOU
OUTSIDE BY THE THROAT,

35:39.268 --> 35:43.172
YOU ARE COMING WITH ME
AND YOU ARE GOING TO FINISH!

35:46.545 --> 35:48.547
IF HIS HEART
DOESN'T START BEATING SOON,

35:48.547 --> 35:51.650
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE HIM OFF BYPASS.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.283
(Teddy) HE'S BACK UP
TO HIS CORE TEMPERATURE.

35:54.283 --> 35:57.486
I DON'T SEE ANY LEAKS.
ALL THE CONNECTIONS ARE RIGHT.

35:57.486 --> 36:00.189
WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE

36:00.189 --> 36:02.291
IF DR. YANG'S HARD WORK
HAS PAID OFF.

36:02.291 --> 36:05.864
(suction gurgling)

36:05.864 --> 36:07.336
(squishes)

36:12.471 --> 36:15.844
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
THERE IT IS.

36:15.844 --> 36:17.646
NICE WORK, DR. YANG.

36:17.646 --> 36:19.548
WELL DONE.

36:19.548 --> 36:22.581
(beeping continues)

36:22.581 --> 36:24.583
CLAMP.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.316
(beeping continues)

36:27.316 --> 36:31.220
(engine roars)

36:31.220 --> 36:34.192
AND, YOU KNOW, SURE, THERE'S
NOT A LOT TO DO OVER THERE,

36:34.192 --> 36:35.694
BUT, UH, THAT JUST MEANS

36:35.694 --> 36:37.696
LESS TO DISTRACT US
FROM THE MEDICINE.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.599
IT'LL JUST BE US FOCUSING
ON THE MEDICINE, WHICH IS GREAT.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.932
WHAT? OH, MY GOD.
DID YOU FORGET YOUR PASSPORT?

36:43.932 --> 36:46.835
I WON
THE CARTER MADISON GRANT.

36:46.835 --> 36:48.977
I WON THE CARTER MADISON GRANT.

36:48.977 --> 36:50.979
DO YOU KNOW
HOW RARE THAT IS?

36:50.979 --> 36:52.981
DO YOU KNOW
HOW SPECIAL THAT IS?

36:52.981 --> 36:55.484
THIS IS THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY
OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER.

36:55.484 --> 36:58.447

A PEDIATRIC SURGEON.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.823
I GET TO CHANGE LIVES.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.326
THAT'S THE DREAM.
I AM LIVING THE DREAM.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.328
AND I AM
OVER THE MOON ABOUT IT.

37:09.328 --> 37:13.332

37:17.536 --> 37:19.708
YOU ARE RUINING AFRICA
FOR ME.
I-I'M NOT.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.012

37:24.012 --> 37:26.014
OKAY.

37:26.014 --> 37:28.417
FINE. I DON'T WANT TO GO

OH, MY GOD. OKAY.
YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

37:38.627 --> 37:41.630
THE FLIGHT'S 18 HOURS.
WE CAN FIGHT ON THE PLANE.

37:41.630 --> 37:44.663
(voice breaking)
YOU'RE RUINING THIS FOR ME,
