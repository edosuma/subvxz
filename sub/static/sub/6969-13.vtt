00:09.623 --> 00:13.252
I remember me and him
all the way back to kindergarten.

00:13.327 --> 00:15.261
He was, uh--

00:18.699 --> 00:21.691
I don't know.

00:21.768 --> 00:24.999
He was like a brother
or something.

00:26.073 --> 00:28.974
And we had some good times.

00:30.577 --> 00:35.480
Good times that I'll never
forget and junk like that.

00:37.551 --> 00:41.351
And like now, we all got to
stick to get her and protect each other,

00:41.421 --> 00:46.188
'cause that's what Bruno
would have wanted.

00:46.259 --> 00:50.662
'Cause they say the cult is gonna
come try and get more of us, and...

00:50.731 --> 00:52.926
we can’t let that happen.

00:56.803 --> 00:59.738
So we gotta kick some butt.

01:01.775 --> 01:04.266
We gotta kick some butt,

01:05.579 --> 01:09.345
Like I'm sure Bruno's
doing in heaven right now.

01:09.416 --> 01:12.874
[Sobbing]

01:18.091 --> 01:21.026
[Boy]
I really don’t know what to say.

01:21.094 --> 01:23.995
[Girl]
Here he is. Boom ?

01:28.969 --> 01:30.903
- [Sobs]
- Boom ?

01:32.272 --> 01:35.833
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

01:35.942 --> 01:38.172
That was beautiful.

01:39.513 --> 01:41.447
Yep.

01:43.583 --> 01:48.282
So did you hear who the cult
is supposed to be coming after next ?

01:48.355 --> 01:50.289
A blond virgin.

01:57.764 --> 02:00.927
Come on.
I'll give you guys a ride home.

02:05.839 --> 02:09.900
Your mom is always saying, "Wait until
you're married. Don't give it away."

02:10.009 --> 02:13.343
Yeah, and then some cult member
wants to kidnap you...

02:13.413 --> 02:16.177
and sacrifice you
because you are a virgin.

02:16.249 --> 02:21.585
God. I mean, how do they even know
if you really are a virgin ?

02:21.655 --> 02:24.749
I don't know.
I don't even want to think about it.

02:24.825 --> 02:27.658
You're not a virgin,
are you, Boom ?

02:27.727 --> 02:30.423
Uh, no.

02:32.699 --> 02:36.999
You know, maybe if we weren't virgins,
we wouldn't be so scared.

03:09.736 --> 03:12.261
- Over here !
- [Man]Hey! He found something.

03:17.477 --> 03:19.672
Oh, God.

03:19.779 --> 03:22.612
- Is he dead ?
- Yeah, looks like he hung himself.

03:29.256 --> 03:34.125
- [Girl] He loves me.
- [Girl] He loves me not.

03:34.194 --> 03:38.392
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

03:38.465 --> 03:43.528
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

03:43.603 --> 03:49.098
- He loves me.
- He loves me not.

03:49.175 --> 03:51.200
He loves me.

03:51.311 --> 03:55.215
- Not !

04:44.397 --> 04:47.730
[ Scully] The map says
to turn right at the intersection.

04:47.801 --> 04:50.235
The detective who contacted me
told me to turn left.

04:50.303 --> 04:52.464
- At the intersection ?
- At the stoplight.

04:52.572 --> 04:54.563
This isn't a stoplight.
It's a stop sign.

04:54.674 --> 04:56.642
I'm sure
she meant stop sign.

04:56.743 --> 04:58.677
Turn right.

05:16.896 --> 05:21.356
What more can I say about the loss
of a young man like Jay De Boom...

05:21.434 --> 05:26.770
that the sadness in each
of our own hearts does not
express more poignantly ?

05:26.873 --> 05:29.205
A few people have asked
if they might come up...

05:29.275 --> 05:32.244
and share some of their own
personal remembrances of Jay.

05:32.312 --> 05:38.217
I’d like to invite them
to come forward at this time and
share some of those thoughts.

05:40.186 --> 05:42.848
His friends called him Boom.
Quarterback of the football team.

05:42.922 --> 05:45.482
He was well liked, a leader.
He was looking forward to college...

05:45.558 --> 05:47.526
until he was found hanged
in the woods two days ago.

05:47.594 --> 05:50.461
It's the third death of a high
school boy in as many months.

05:50.530 --> 05:53.863
In your fax you said there were strong
suspicions of a satanic cult at work.

05:53.933 --> 05:57.733
That's the popular opinion around here.
Wildly popular actually.

05:57.804 --> 05:59.203
Based on what evidence ?

05:59.305 --> 06:02.536
Various eyewitness accounts
of satanic rituals being conducted.

06:02.642 --> 06:06.305
I remember me and Boom
back to kindergarten.

06:06.379 --> 06:10.577
He was-- I don't know--
Like a brother or something.

06:10.650 --> 06:14.245
You have physical evidence
of these rituals being conducted ?

06:14.320 --> 06:16.948
No. No, just
the murder victims.

06:17.023 --> 06:21.357
So you have nothing concrete
to connect these things to satanists ?

06:21.428 --> 06:26.661
If you detect a hint of skepticism
or incredulity in Agent Scully's voice,

06:26.733 --> 06:29.463
it's because of the overwhelming
evidence gathered by the F.B.I....

06:29.536 --> 06:32.869
debunking virtually all claims
of ritual abuse by satanic cults.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.372
- Is that true ?
- [ Inhales ]

06:35.442 --> 06:38.070
Don't ask me.

06:38.178 --> 06:42.808
Our research has proven that most of
these accounts are false or imagined.

06:42.882 --> 06:47.751
The trauma or mental illness that is
often linked to satanic cults...

06:47.821 --> 06:51.587
is the result of denial,
hysteria and misplaced blame.

06:51.658 --> 06:54.718
You're going to have a hard time
convincing the locals of that,

06:54.794 --> 06:57.957
especially after hearing the
stories of the two girls that
were there the night Boom died.

06:58.031 --> 06:59.965
- Who interviewed them ?
- I did.

07:00.033 --> 07:03.935
- Together or separate ?
- Together. Why ?

07:04.003 --> 07:07.131
Then you have no way of
determining whether or not
their stories are fabricated.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.698
No, no, these are good kids
we're talking about.

07:10.810 --> 07:14.610
Outstanding students--and
the details they gave-- I doubt
they could have made them up.

07:14.681 --> 07:19.015
Let me guess. They told you about a
wild beast entering in on a Black Mass,

07:19.085 --> 07:22.851
the drinking of blood, the
sacrifice of an infant...

07:22.922 --> 07:25.413
or a blond virgin.

07:25.492 --> 07:30.828
Yeah. That's right.
Excuse me.

07:30.897 --> 07:33.593
[Man]
Let me in there !

07:33.666 --> 07:39.002
- Where is she going ?
- You don't suppose
she's a virgin, do you ?

07:39.105 --> 07:41.733
I doubt she's
even a blond.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.672
[Man]
Would you let me by ?

07:43.743 --> 07:45.210
You can't go in !

07:45.278 --> 07:49.806
How long are we going to stand by
and watch our children die...

07:49.883 --> 07:53.216
while Satan's soldiers
run free in this city ?

07:53.286 --> 07:55.686
- Bob, this is no time--
- No time ? No time ?

07:55.755 --> 07:59.191
Hey ! Hey, hey, Bob !
This is not the place for this.

07:59.259 --> 08:01.193
My wife can't sleep at night !

08:01.261 --> 08:03.695
My kids say they can
feel Satan's presence !

08:03.763 --> 08:07.961
We got to wake up
and take action, people !

08:08.034 --> 08:11.333
We got to cast the devil
out of our community!

08:19.279 --> 08:21.873
[Screaming]

08:25.151 --> 08:27.711
All right, everybody !
Stay calm !

08:34.260 --> 08:37.558
Maybe we’re just
imagining that.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.136
My name is Terri Roberts.

08:50.243 --> 08:53.007
I go to Grover Cleveland
Alexander High School.

08:53.079 --> 08:55.877
I'm a senior with
a 3.98 grade point average.

08:55.949 --> 08:58.417
My name is Margi Kleinjan.

08:58.484 --> 09:01.351
I go to Grover Cleveland
Alexander High School.

09:01.421 --> 09:05.357
I'm a senior with
a 3.75 grade point average.

09:05.425 --> 09:08.622
I'm on the cheerleading yell squad
with my best friend Terri.

09:08.695 --> 09:11.926
I'm on the cheerleading yell squad
with my best friend Margi.

09:11.998 --> 09:14.489
We plan to go to college
together in the fall.

09:14.567 --> 09:19.300
Yeah. Could you tell me again
exactly what happened the night
of Jay De Boom's death ?

09:19.405 --> 09:21.600
Uh, Boom--

09:21.708 --> 09:25.804
jay was giving us a ride home
in his truck...

09:25.912 --> 09:29.040
when all of a sudden
he swerved off the road.

09:29.115 --> 09:31.913
Like he had been possessed
or something.

09:31.985 --> 09:35.853
He made us get out of the car
and walk to a clearing where...

09:35.922 --> 09:40.757
people were wearing black robes
and holding black candles.

09:40.827 --> 09:44.024
I couldn't see their faces
underneath their hoods,

09:44.097 --> 09:46.224
but I knew they were
up to no good.

09:46.299 --> 09:48.290
How did you know
they were up to no good ?

09:48.368 --> 09:51.360
They were all standing
around this altar,

09:51.437 --> 09:54.429
and one of them
had a long knife...

09:54.540 --> 09:59.568
with a snake's head on
the handle with ruby eyes.

09:59.679 --> 10:04.013
I thought we were dead because
we'd heard they were going
to sacrifice a blond virgin.

10:04.083 --> 10:08.543
But instead they just brought
out this little crying baby...

10:08.621 --> 10:10.816
and put it on the altar.

10:10.890 --> 10:14.189
The man with the knife started
saying some kind of prayer.

10:14.260 --> 10:17.491
He was chanting,

10:17.563 --> 10:21.260
and he was saying stuff about how
they were going to sacrifice the baby,

10:21.334 --> 10:25.031
because it hadn't
been christened yet...

10:25.138 --> 10:29.905
and how they were going to bury it in
a mass grave on the outskirts of town...

10:29.976 --> 10:31.878
with all the other babies
that they'd killed.

10:31.878 --> 10:32.776
with all the other babies
that they'd killed.

10:32.879 --> 10:36.645
And-- And--

10:36.716 --> 10:41.210
[ Margi ] The whole group
was chanting and saying things.

10:41.287 --> 10:46.953
The man with the knife
raised the knife up over the baby,

10:47.026 --> 10:51.486
and that's when Terri and I
just ran for our lives.

10:51.564 --> 10:55.591
The two stories are virtually identical.
The one corroborates the other.

10:55.668 --> 10:58.899
I don't suppose there have been
any actual reports of stolen infants...

10:58.972 --> 11:02.169
or of mass graves being uncovered
anywhere in town...

11:02.241 --> 11:06.769
or that you found an altar
or any other evidence of a Black Mass ?

11:06.879 --> 11:09.404
No. No, in fact, we haven't.

11:09.515 --> 11:11.710
The problem is that the details
of these accounts...

11:11.784 --> 11:14.651
could have been taken from
any news paper or magazine.

11:14.721 --> 11:19.852
As horrific as they sound
the stories that these girls
told are common, even cliché.

11:19.926 --> 11:23.054
If you detect a hint of impatience
in Agent Scully's voice,

11:23.129 --> 11:26.030
that's because the F.B.I.'s study
also found that in most cases,

11:26.099 --> 11:28.033
Like the McMartin
preschool trial,

11:28.101 --> 11:32.299
witnesses were prompted in their
statements by rumors or stories
that were being circulated,

11:32.372 --> 11:34.306
and there was nothing
to support them.

11:34.374 --> 11:38.811
-How do you explain the burning coffin ?
-Don't ask me.

11:38.878 --> 11:40.971
[Woman Sighs]

11:50.323 --> 11:54.453
There have been incidents
where the embalming fluid
used to preserve the body...

11:54.527 --> 11:57.621
have caused chemical reactions
and produced heat and burning.

11:57.697 --> 12:00.894
I see nothing here that
would suggest otherwise.

12:00.967 --> 12:02.901
What is that ?

12:02.969 --> 12:06.564
- [Scully] What's what ?
- That pattern on his chest.

12:06.639 --> 12:11.702
Yeah, I see it. It looks like a... goat.
Some kind of horned beast.

12:11.811 --> 12:13.836
- A horned beast ?
- Yeah. Right here...

12:13.946 --> 12:16.073
in a circle.

12:16.182 --> 12:18.742
I think you guys are seeing something
that isn’t there.

12:18.851 --> 12:22.582
No, no, right here. Look.
You see that the horns are right there.

12:22.655 --> 12:25.590
No, I don't see
the horns right there.

12:27.427 --> 12:31.761
I assume you'll call me
if you need me for anything further.

12:31.831 --> 12:34.664
If it’s no bother--
If it’s not too big a deal,

12:34.734 --> 12:37.134
maybe you can get me a few
photographs of that thing...

12:37.203 --> 12:40.001
which bears absolutely
no resemblance to a horned beast.

12:40.073 --> 12:42.007
Sure. Fine. Whatever.

12:51.784 --> 12:53.308
Oh, hi.

12:53.419 --> 12:57.822
Uh, hi. What are you
doing with my cat ?

12:57.890 --> 12:59.824
He was scratching to get in.

12:59.892 --> 13:03.055
I thought with the threat
of satanic animal sacrifices looming,

13:03.129 --> 13:06.189
maybe you should
keep him inside.

13:06.265 --> 13:11.532
I thought the F.B.I.'s research
would have debunked that theory.

13:11.604 --> 13:14.664
First off, I'd like to apologize
for my partner's rude behavior.

13:14.740 --> 13:18.699
She tends to be rather rigid,
but rigid in a wonderful way,

13:18.811 --> 13:20.904
not like she was today.

13:21.013 --> 13:25.541
Personally, I like to try
to keep a more open mind.

13:25.651 --> 13:28.711
So, what are you doing
at my house ?

13:28.788 --> 13:32.815
I was hoping you could help me
solve the mystery of the horny beast.

13:45.304 --> 13:48.137
[Woman]
Let me make sure I heard you right.

13:48.207 --> 13:50.141
You say you see horns.

13:50.209 --> 13:54.737
You don't see a goat here ?
Some kind of beast ?

13:54.847 --> 13:57.611
This is a trick, right ?
To try and entrap me ?

13:57.683 --> 14:00.174
- Nobody's trying to entrap you.
- Yeah, right.

14:00.286 --> 14:03.949
There are a lot of loonies
running around this town that'd
like to think I'm a satanist.

14:04.023 --> 14:06.924
But the truth is,
I'm just a number cruncher,

14:06.993 --> 14:09.018
trying to make
an honest living.

14:09.095 --> 14:11.029
What do you think
is going on ?

14:11.097 --> 14:13.725
I think the whole town's
lost its marbles.

14:13.799 --> 14:17.257
I should have been the first
to see it coming, but it's hard
being a small business owner.

14:17.336 --> 14:20.100
- You should see the paperwork.
- What do you mean, "seen it coming" ?

14:20.173 --> 14:22.539
We're heading into
a rare planetary alignment...

14:22.608 --> 14:25.475
where Mercury, Mars and Uranus
are extreme influences.

14:25.578 --> 14:27.375
On what ?

14:27.480 --> 14:30.381
Office hours
are 9:00 to 5:00.

14:30.449 --> 14:33.441
All major credit cards
accepted.

14:33.553 --> 14:36.522
[Boy Shouts]

14:36.589 --> 14:39.353
All right. Move back.

14:39.425 --> 14:41.393
To your zones.

14:42.929 --> 14:45.124
Clear !

14:45.198 --> 14:47.860
- Shoot that ball !
- [Whistle Blows]

14:47.934 --> 14:50.903
Shoot that ball !
Let's shoot !

14:53.406 --> 14:56.136
- Craig Wilmore.
- Hate him, Roger.

14:56.209 --> 14:58.200
Points though for
improved dermatology, Gene.

14:58.311 --> 15:00.973
- Hey !
- Man !

15:01.080 --> 15:03.878
- [Whistle Blows]
- Come on !

15:03.950 --> 15:08.011
Can it be true that these people
will soon be adults bringing
new life into this world ?

15:08.087 --> 15:10.021
I'm so depressed.

15:13.092 --> 15:15.083
Hi, Scott.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.527
- [Whistle Blows]
- [Man Shouts]

15:19.165 --> 15:22.601
Scott Simmons.

15:22.668 --> 15:25.262
Babe-alicious
in overtime, Gene.

15:25.338 --> 15:28.398

33:12.203 --> 33:16.230
- I didn't kill him.

[ Girl ] I know who the killer is.
I know who did it all.

34:21.505 --> 34:25.943
- Who is this ?
- Margi Kleinjan.

34:26.010 --> 34:28.501
- Where are you, Margi ?
- [ Sobbing ]

34:28.580 --> 34:30.844
just tell me where you are.

[ Murmuring ]

34:37.255 --> 34:41.918
I don't know what you think
you're doing, but I suggest you
put that gun down, sir,

34:41.993 --> 34:43.984
or I'm going to
have to arrest you.

34:44.062 --> 34:46.553
We're not standing around anymore,
waiting for answers.

34:46.630 --> 34:48.565
We're taking this situation
into our own hands.

34:48.632 --> 34:52.034
You can't go walking down the middle
of the street carrying a loaded weapon.

34:52.103 --> 34:56.164
- It's against the law.
- Not if I'm hunting it's not.
Hunting satanists.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.004
There are no satanists here.

34:58.076 --> 35:01.068
Then who killed those kids ?
And who killed all these birds ?

35:01.146 --> 35:04.343
Somebody help me!

35:05.216 --> 35:08.276
I know who the killer is.

35:10.188 --> 35:12.418

All the murders.

35:25.937 --> 35:28.132
[Girl Crying]

35:48.760 --> 35:51.627
Come on, Margi.
Let's get you out of here.

35:51.696 --> 35:54.256
- She killed him.
- Who ?

35:54.332 --> 35:57.768
Terri. She killed
all of them.

35:57.836 --> 36:00.202
She killed all of
the high school boys ?

36:00.271 --> 36:02.831
And Brenda Summerfield.

36:02.907 --> 36:04.875
How did she do it ?

36:04.943 --> 36:07.002
I think she's possessed
or something.

36:07.078 --> 36:11.378
She killed Scott Simmons tonight
with a garage door spring.

36:11.483 --> 36:15.647
I don't know how she does it.
I think-- I think she's--

36:15.720 --> 36:18.052
I think she's evil.

36:18.122 --> 36:20.317
She tricked Boom into
going up on that cliff,

36:20.391 --> 36:23.827
and then she pushed him off
and laughed about it.

36:23.895 --> 36:27.228
just like she did Eric Bauer
the other night in the gym.

36:27.298 --> 36:29.391
When all the lights went out...

36:29.467 --> 36:32.834
and she knew that he was trapped
underneath the bleachers,

36:32.904 --> 36:36.101
she could hear him screaming,
but she wouldn't make it stop.

36:36.174 --> 36:39.541
Why didn’t you stop her, Terri ?
Why didn’t you tell anybody ?

36:39.611 --> 36:44.412
Because-- Because
I was afraid of her.

36:44.516 --> 36:47.576
Because she was my best friend.

36:47.685 --> 36:50.085
Best friends are supposed
to stick together, right ?

36:50.154 --> 36:53.646

36:53.725 --> 36:55.659
- [Phone Beeps]
- Scully !

36:55.727 --> 36:57.194
Scully, it's me.

37:01.399 --> 37:03.492
Where are you ?

37:03.568 --> 37:07.095
I'm at a crime scene, a new one. I think
I have a solid lead on these deaths.

37:07.171 --> 37:10.663
I'm way ahead of you, Mulder.
I've got a suspect I want to bring in.

37:10.742 --> 37:13.108
- Who's that ?
- Margi Kleinjan.

37:18.016 --> 37:20.382
Hold on a second.

37:21.953 --> 37:24.046
- [ Whispering ] Margi Kleinjan ?
- That's right.

37:24.122 --> 37:25.783
Her friend gave us
a statement.

37:25.857 --> 37:29.486
Actually, I'm way ahead of you.
I'm with Margi.

37:29.561 --> 37:31.995
She gave me a statement
implicating her friend.

37:32.063 --> 37:35.430
- Who ?
- Terri.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.469
Actually, I'm way ahead of you,
because I'm with Terri now.

37:38.536 --> 37:41.994
- You're what ?
- I've got your suspect,
and you've got mine.

37:42.073 --> 37:44.541
Why does that make sense
to me at this point ?

37:44.609 --> 37:47.134
I don't think this has anything
to do with any cult.

37:47.211 --> 37:52.274
I want to get them both in
and get a formal statement and
clear this thing up, okay ?

37:52.383 --> 37:56.581
- Scully ?
- Sure. Fine. Whatever.

38:07.231 --> 38:09.290
[Man]
All right, Steve. This is what we have.

38:09.367 --> 38:11.835

We are but visitors on this rock,

41:44.682 --> 41:48.743
hurtling through time and space
at 66,000milesanhour,

41:48.820 --> 41:53.951
tethered to a burning sphere
by an invisible force
in an unfathomable universe.

41:54.025 --> 41:56.220
This most of us
take for granted,

41:56.327 --> 41:58.454

have anymore effect on us...

41:58.563 --> 42:03.159
than a butterfly beating its
wings half way around the world.

Or that two girls born on the same date
at the same time and the same place...

might not find themselves
the unfortunate focus
of similar unseen forces,

42:11.709 --> 42:16.612
converging like the planets themselves
into burning pinpoints of cosmic energy,

42:16.681 --> 42:22.142
whose absolute gravity
would threaten to swallow and
consume everything in its path.

42:22.220 --> 42:27.522
Or maybe the answer lies
even further from our grasp.
