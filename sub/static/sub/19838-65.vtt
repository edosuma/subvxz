<b>Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.</b>

00:09.290 --> 00:12.960
<b>Meruem... That is your name.</b>

00:16.580 --> 00:19.250
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

00:21.320 --> 00:23.370
<b>Meruem, King of Ants,</b>

00:24.240 --> 00:27.210
<b>you understand nothing...</b>

00:31.100 --> 00:35.150
<b>of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!</b>

00:39.320 --> 00:40.360
<b><i>I see now...</i></b>

00:41.720 --> 00:43.520
<b><i>Yes... I see...</i></b>

00:47.350 --> 00:48.830
<b><i>You had me in checkmate</i></b>

00:50.180 --> 00:51.330
<b><i>from the start...</i></b>

02:11.980 --> 02:17.030
<b>Hostility x And x Determination</b>

02:31.870 --> 02:35.860
<b>The bomb was both low-budget and compact,</b>

02:35.860 --> 02:38.300
<b>while also proving surprisingly lethal.</b>

02:39.250 --> 02:42.300
<b>With the right technology,</b>

02:42.300 --> 02:45.490
<b>it was possible to quickly mass 
produce these bombs.</b>

02:46.020 --> 02:48.660
<b>Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,</b>

02:49.670 --> 02:53.580
<b>it was called the Miniature Rose, 
or the poor man's rose,</b>

02:53.580 --> 02:56.160
<b>and was popular with small dictatorships.</b>

02:59.720 --> 03:04.410
<b>In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,</b>

03:04.410 --> 03:06.830
<b>ten times as many roses had bloomed,</b>

03:07.330 --> 03:10.540
<b>consuming 5.12 million human lives.</b>

04:15.930 --> 04:20.580
<b>After terrorists used the bomb in the 
center of an adversarial nation's capital,</b>

04:21.250 --> 04:25.020
<b>taking more than 110,000 lives,</b>

04:25.520 --> 04:30.410
<b>an international treaty was signed that 
banned the bomb's production.</b>

04:31.170 --> 04:35.420
<b>However, over eighty percent of the 
world's countries rejected the proposal</b>

04:35.990 --> 04:39.420
<b>to discard and ban the use of 
roses they had already produced,</b>

04:40.510 --> 04:43.920
<b>meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds</b>

04:44.630 --> 04:49.790
<b>still wait silently in many countries 
for their chance to bloom.</b>

04:53.690 --> 04:56.240
<b>"How are humans and Ants different?"</b>

04:56.750 --> 04:59.690
<b>When Netero decided to use his last resort,</b>

05:00.320 --> 05:04.290
<b>could this thought have crossed his mind?</b>

05:04.890 --> 05:07.880
<b>Now, there is no way to find out.</b>

05:19.010 --> 05:22.010
<b>The two immediately understood</b>

05:24.750 --> 05:31.720
<b>what the distant cloud of smoke and 
resulting vibration in the air signified.</b>

05:37.530 --> 05:38.730
<b>At the same time,</b>

05:40.280 --> 05:44.220
<b>Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.</b>

05:51.160 --> 05:53.320
<b>After his experience with Youpi,</b>

05:53.320 --> 05:56.600
<b>Knuckle hoped to reach a 
similar understanding with Pouf.</b>

05:57.210 --> 06:02.390
<b>But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.</b>

06:22.840 --> 06:24.660
<b><i>If the King waves his baton,</i></b>

06:24.660 --> 06:26.870
<b><i>the soldiers will become demons if necessary.</i></b>

06:29.720 --> 06:34.280
<b><i>Pouf's main body must have learned 
that something happened to the King.</i></b>

06:35.540 --> 06:39.790
<b><i>That led to the transformation of the clone's 
face, revealing the Ants' true nature.</i></b>

06:41.110 --> 06:43.910
<b><i>Did the chairman defeat the King?</i></b>

06:44.420 --> 06:47.300
<b><i>No, it doesn't matter either way...</i></b>

06:51.760 --> 06:57.920
<b>In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier 
that could not be overcome.</b>

07:05.320 --> 07:06.610
<b><i>It's destroyed!</i></b>

07:08.720 --> 07:10.530
<b><i>Is everyone okay?</i></b>

07:28.290 --> 07:29.950
<b><i>This is brutal...</i></b>

07:31.080 --> 07:34.320
<b><i>It only took them thirty minutes 
to wreck the whole place.</i></b>

07:51.610 --> 07:53.140
<b>That was close...</b>

07:54.090 --> 07:55.200
<b>Ikalgo.</b>

07:59.270 --> 08:00.190
<b>Killua!</b>

08:13.320 --> 08:14.460
<b>Palm...</b>

08:16.930 --> 08:18.010
<b>I see.</b>

08:18.480 --> 08:19.910
<b>But I'm glad to see you.</b>

08:20.410 --> 08:22.480
<b>You returned to us.</b>

08:23.190 --> 08:28.040
<b>Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car.</b>

08:28.040 --> 08:30.450
<b>No, she wants to stay.</b>

08:31.840 --> 08:35.170
<b>Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight.</b>

08:35.500 --> 08:38.730
<b>In terms of raw offensive power, 
she has me beat...</b>

08:39.220 --> 08:40.080
<b>Probably.</b>

08:42.550 --> 08:46.250
<b>To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once.</b>

08:46.920 --> 08:47.930
<b>However...</b>

08:48.600 --> 08:49.800
<b>I'll wait.</b>

08:50.990 --> 08:53.380
<b>I'll respect his wishes...</b>

08:54.240 --> 08:55.170
<b>His wishes?</b>

08:56.690 --> 09:00.350
<b>He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.</b>

09:02.020 --> 09:04.870
<b><i>I'll wait right here for one hour.</i></b>

09:06.380 --> 09:09.550
<b>And once he's made up his mind, 
that's it. He won't budge.</b>

09:10.820 --> 09:14.610
<b>In return, he performs his best</b>

09:14.610 --> 09:17.160
<b>when circumstances are as expected.</b>

09:17.630 --> 09:22.390
<b>Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.</b>

09:22.390 --> 09:25.230
<b>B-But what if...</b>

09:25.230 --> 09:27.170
<b>Yeah, I know.</b>

09:27.910 --> 09:33.890
<b>If he gets into serious trouble, 
we'll immediately rush in to help him.</b>

09:38.020 --> 09:39.360
<b><i>I see...</i></b>

09:39.670 --> 09:42.250
<b><i>So that's why they're staying behind.</i></b>

09:44.150 --> 09:48.290
<b><i>Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,</i></b>

09:48.800 --> 09:51.180
<b><i>he still won't be able to beat Pitou.</i></b>

09:51.860 --> 09:55.630
<b><i>In fact, even if the three of us join him,</i></b>

09:55.630 --> 09:58.350
<b><i>they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou.</i></b>

10:01.350 --> 10:03.300
<b><i>They're staying behind</i></b>

10:03.930 --> 10:05.740
<b><i>to die with him!</i></b>

10:12.650 --> 10:14.600
<b>We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.</b>

10:15.090 --> 10:16.220
<b>Want to come?</b>

10:17.030 --> 10:18.220
<b>Absolutely.</b>

10:20.590 --> 10:22.430
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

10:32.510 --> 10:34.930
<b>We separated the King and the Royal Guard</b>

10:34.930 --> 10:37.360
<b>to let the chairman defeat the King.</b>

10:38.300 --> 10:43.370
<b>As Knov-san said, we've completed 
the mission we were assigned.</b>

10:44.280 --> 10:47.370
<b>Each of us will have to decide 
where we go from here.</b>

10:48.090 --> 10:51.130
<b>Do we stop or keep going?</b>

11:00.360 --> 11:01.510
<b>I am</b>

11:02.320 --> 11:04.390
<b>going to keep fighting them.</b>

11:05.480 --> 11:08.390
<b>I've already laid down my life here more than once.</b>

11:09.490 --> 11:11.300
<b>Even if we can't reach an understanding,</b>

11:11.750 --> 11:14.020
<b>I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.</b>

12:07.730 --> 12:08.990
<b>You're finished.</b>

12:17.780 --> 12:19.810
<b><i>Why did he say that?</i></b>

12:20.480 --> 12:23.010
<b><i>There's still time left...</i></b>

12:23.710 --> 12:26.320
<b><i>Did he notice that my surgery was done?</i></b>

12:27.890 --> 12:30.770
<b><i>I made sure to hide my progress from him.</i></b>

12:31.860 --> 12:35.650
<b><i>But if I showed any sign of 
relaxing after finishing it,</i></b>

12:36.370 --> 12:38.380
<b><i>and he noticed that...</i></b>

12:40.060 --> 12:41.990
<b><i>I must kill him.</i></b>

12:43.260 --> 12:44.910
<b><i>No matter the cost!</i></b>

12:45.420 --> 12:46.690
<b><i>I must kill him...</i></b>

12:47.920 --> 12:49.560
<b><i>For the King's sake!</i></b>

12:51.940 --> 12:53.910
<b><i>Did he notice my bloodlust then?</i></b>

12:54.890 --> 12:55.920
<b>Stand up.</b>

13:15.810 --> 13:17.770
<b>We move to Peijing now.</b>

13:18.160 --> 13:20.480
<b>Running is faster for us.</b>

13:32.950 --> 13:35.610
<b>What happened to me?</b>

13:37.550 --> 13:40.210
<b>I would like toâ€”</b>

13:41.040 --> 13:44.590
<b>The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her.</b>

13:47.070 --> 13:49.350
<b>S-Sorry!</b>

13:49.750 --> 13:53.100
<b>Am I interrupting something?</b>

13:54.670 --> 13:59.100
<b>U-Um, I don't understand what's going on...</b>

14:03.910 --> 14:05.000
<b>I understand.</b>

14:05.600 --> 14:06.610
<b>Let's go.</b>

14:10.870 --> 14:15.120
<b>Pitou was close enough to take 
off his head with one arm.</b>

14:15.960 --> 14:17.410
<b>But Pitou couldn't move.</b>

14:18.740 --> 14:21.790
<b>After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,</b>

14:21.790 --> 14:24.060
<b>Pitou's instincts said to obey.</b>

14:26.300 --> 14:27.880
<b><i>I can't make a move now...</i></b>

14:28.310 --> 14:29.450
<b><i>My chance will come.</i></b>

14:29.990 --> 14:32.210
<b><i>There'll be many, on our way to Peijing.</i></b>

14:33.610 --> 14:37.650
<b><i>But I must get Komugi to the King!</i></b>

14:49.460 --> 14:53.330
<b>Gon, want me to use Chapter 7 
Bankruptcy on Pitou?</b>

14:54.560 --> 14:58.390
<b>If there's an escape attempt, 
I can track Pitou down.</b>

14:58.390 --> 15:02.310
<b>And if Pitou tries to fight back, 
APR will protect you.</b>

15:12.820 --> 15:14.600
<b>Thank you, Knuckle.</b>

15:15.260 --> 15:16.740
<b>But it's okay.</b>

15:18.080 --> 15:20.350
<b>I trust Pitou...</b>

15:22.280 --> 15:26.110
<b>So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,</b>

15:26.960 --> 15:28.360
<b>keep an eye on her.</b>

15:31.350 --> 15:34.620
<b>A-Are you talking about me?</b>

15:50.490 --> 15:52.680
<b><i>Is he going to use Komugi...</i></b>

15:53.730 --> 15:56.010
<b><i>As a hostage?!</i></b>

15:59.640 --> 16:05.520
<b>Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go.</b>

16:06.680 --> 16:09.530
<b>I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?</b>

16:11.460 --> 16:12.450
<b>Pitou?</b>

16:34.100 --> 16:35.550
<b>You sure about this, Killua?</b>

16:37.330 --> 16:39.310
<b>You aren't going with Gon?</b>

16:40.300 --> 16:41.280
<b><i>We were...</i></b>

16:41.730 --> 16:45.120
<b><i>No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon.</i></b>

16:46.060 --> 16:49.070
<b><i>But Gon didn't want him to come!</i></b>

16:52.580 --> 16:55.780
<b><i>Pitou and I will go by ourselves.</i></b>

16:58.000 --> 16:59.070
<b>It's okay.</b>

16:59.380 --> 17:01.260
<b>That was always the plan.</b>

17:01.720 --> 17:04.870
<b>And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.</b>

17:05.490 --> 17:07.660
<b>You mean the hostage?</b>

17:07.660 --> 17:11.440
<b>Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,</b>

17:11.440 --> 17:13.650
<b>and Pitou managed to capture me.</b>

17:14.090 --> 17:17.240
<b>Then Pitou would have the option 
to exchange hostages.</b>

17:19.350 --> 17:21.000
<b><i>Seriously...</i></b>

17:21.410 --> 17:25.480
<b><i>What have they been through for 
their minds to work this way?</i></b>

17:26.600 --> 17:27.980
<b>It's all right.</b>

17:28.470 --> 17:30.690
<b>Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,</b>

17:30.690 --> 17:34.360
<b>I'll know immediately if something happens.</b>

17:35.240 --> 17:38.490
<b>Besides, Pitou won't abandon her.</b>

17:38.980 --> 17:41.990
<b>Which means that Gon is safe.</b>

17:46.740 --> 17:51.000
<b><i>I can't understand what's going on.</i></b>

17:52.170 --> 17:55.990
<b><i>Where is the Supreme Leader?</i></b>

17:55.990 --> 17:58.200
<b><i>Who are these people?</i></b>

18:21.430 --> 18:25.310
<b>The heat of the explosion had 
melted the rock into magma,</b>

18:25.310 --> 18:29.240
<b>leaving a scene resembling the 
mouth of an active volcano,</b>

18:29.690 --> 18:32.330
<b>producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke</b>

18:32.330 --> 18:35.300
<b>that prevented the living from entering.</b>

18:45.750 --> 18:46.810
<b>Pouf!</b>

18:50.670 --> 18:54.410
<b>I'll search inside, so I need you to 
search the surrounding area.</b>

18:54.800 --> 18:57.430
<b>It's possible that the explosion 
sent the King flying.</b>

18:59.620 --> 19:02.490
<b>I was wrong...</b>

19:04.420 --> 19:08.830
<b>We will kill them all, with the King at our side.</b>

19:10.350 --> 19:12.200
<b>None will be spared!</b>

20:09.950 --> 20:11.640
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

20:56.810 --> 21:00.940
<b>Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.</b>

21:01.440 --> 21:04.480
<b>Before he could even see the truth for himself,</b>

21:05.340 --> 21:08.950
<b>tears were already streaming down Pouf's face.</b>

21:13.390 --> 21:17.800
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

21:16.020 --> 21:20.210
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

23:24.850 --> 23:25.500
<b>Next time:</b>

23:25.500 --> 23:28.340
<b>Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.</b>

23:28.340 --> 23:31.050
<b>I never ask for anything in return.</b>

23:31.050 --> 23:32.800
<b>Isn't that unconditional love?</b>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.680
<b>Unparalleled joy.</b>
