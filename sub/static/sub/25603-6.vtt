00:00.010 --> 00:02.580
- Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- John Henry Holliday, ma'am.

00:02.620 --> 00:03.880
- Boyfriend?
- Oh...

00:03.950 --> 00:05.650
- I'm a vampire.
- She's my wife.

00:05.710 --> 00:06.710
You're married!!

00:06.720 --> 00:08.279
I don't like you at all.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.096
- Waverly's shtupping a cop.
- Her name's Nicole.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.930
- The one available guy in town.
- Are you? Available.

00:13.941 --> 00:16.419
I have been covering
this shit up for too long.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.290
I'm tired of it.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.250
- What is that?
- Bulshar's ring.

00:21.260 --> 00:22.260
That was fealty.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.800
- She's gone now.
- Your sister is blessed.

00:24.870 --> 00:28.140
Her real father is an angel.
An honest-to-God...

00:28.200 --> 00:30.040
angel.

00:34.540 --> 00:37.040
If only it were socially acceptable

00:37.110 --> 00:39.110
to wear this all year-round.

00:39.420 --> 00:40.980
So...

00:41.400 --> 00:44.990
who's up for some rum n'
eggnog, hold the nog?

00:56.560 --> 00:58.440
Come on, it can't be that bad.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.280
Oh.

01:09.810 --> 01:13.350
Okay, okay. Wait. I've got
something that'll help.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.680
Oh, man.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.620
There! Now you're now fully elfed.

01:18.690 --> 01:21.920
I feel like I should knight
you with a candy cane.

01:24.690 --> 01:26.060
Hey, whoa, whoa.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.160
We're good for trees, hon.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.290
Well, with all due respect,
ma'am, the season demands it.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.970
Genuine article.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.960
Are you questioning my
festive decorating ability?

01:40.740 --> 01:43.040
We just banished a
demon from this house.

01:43.110 --> 01:45.250
Last thing we need is mites.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.450
It's a whole thing.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.060
I'm ready to get my Kringle on.

01:55.120 --> 01:59.370
But Nedley really does make
the perfect Santa. Right?

01:59.380 --> 02:03.140
He's got a certain je ne sais
jolly that you lack, honey.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.679
So where's that leave me, then?

02:06.680 --> 02:08.269
Legolas for life?

02:08.270 --> 02:11.510
No. I know. It's not fair
that you're always elf-cast.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.310
Mm-mm. It's not fair.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.910
But it sure is cute.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.280
Well, that's not canon.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.690
It's that time of the year!

02:25.250 --> 02:28.580
Oh, what are you... ? That's no angel.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.760
- Well, I've always used this.
- Not always.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.930
I mean... after you left.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.079
Can I please, please

02:38.080 --> 02:40.220
just give you two the Christmas
that I always wanted?

02:40.300 --> 02:42.940
Prison Christmas was tough.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.040
Our eggnog was scrambled.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.050
I guess the menstru-angel
can go back in my box.

02:53.110 --> 02:54.750
Thank you, Wynonna.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.139
Oh. My yams need to be mashed,

02:59.140 --> 03:00.620
and by the looks of it, so do you.

03:01.620 --> 03:03.580
- Okay.
- Go on.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.160
Go chase down that tree-touting
hunk of Holliday cheer.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.730
It's Christmas.

03:10.730 --> 03:12.740
Well, I'm not calling Doc.

03:14.070 --> 03:17.370
And I don't need to get laid,
that's for... damn sure.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.380
Purgatory Fire needs your help!

03:28.450 --> 03:30.950
Give back this holiday season.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.220
Santa's knees are a little fragile,

03:35.300 --> 03:36.620
so there isn't gonna be any lap-sitting,

03:36.630 --> 03:38.900
but you can still tell me what you want.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.280
- Uh...
- How about you, son?

03:42.360 --> 03:44.360
What would you like to
have under your tree?

03:44.430 --> 03:46.170
Selena Gomez.

03:46.230 --> 03:48.500
Aren't you a little old for this?

03:48.510 --> 03:49.900
Santa?

03:51.070 --> 03:52.260
Santa, wait!

03:52.640 --> 03:54.480
Okay, son, joke's over.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.199
- Wait. Tim?
- Santa, wait.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.650
Santa!

03:57.680 --> 03:59.110
Santa!

03:59.260 --> 04:01.580
- Santa?
- Tim!

04:04.850 --> 04:06.520
Tim!

04:11.040 --> 04:12.280
Tim!

04:13.660 --> 04:14.700
Santa!

04:21.360 --> 04:22.460
Tim?

04:34.020 --> 04:35.120
Santa?

04:35.180 --> 04:37.950
Help me!! Help!!!

04:38.020 --> 04:40.420
No!!! Help me!!

04:40.490 --> 04:43.220
No!!! Oh, my God!

05:09.650 --> 05:11.520
Bye.

05:13.020 --> 05:14.170
Oh...

05:14.200 --> 05:16.750
- Bye, cutie.
- Argh.

05:16.790 --> 05:18.660
Those your ears, or you
just happy to see me?

05:18.670 --> 05:20.330
Yeah, don't. Okay.

05:21.730 --> 05:22.959
There's rum in it.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.520
And you're gonna need it.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.770
It's crazy having her back here.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.800
Yes, as crazy as we thought
she was last week.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.180
Do you think she's okay now?

05:33.240 --> 05:35.540
Mm... don't leave her alone today.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.950
Mm. I won't.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.350
I want to be here.

05:40.420 --> 05:41.880
With her.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.230
Oh, and I have to dig around
for the menstru-angel.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.420
Oh, no-go.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.980
Mama's not a fan of our
blessedly absorbent friend.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.100
- What?
- I know.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.700
I didn't know they were
tampons when I made it.

05:53.610 --> 05:56.010
- I can convince Mama.
- Wait!

05:56.610 --> 05:58.820
There's something else. Um...

05:59.980 --> 06:01.420
It's about your father.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.739
My dad was an angel?

06:02.740 --> 06:04.940
Like, an angel. Oh, God.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.579
No, they... Angels don't exist.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.320
- Ah, shit.
- Oh, my God, I'm hyperventilating.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.190
What... ? How could he be an angel?!

06:10.260 --> 06:11.819
Be an angel and tell
me where you two keep

06:11.820 --> 06:13.280
- the cranberry sauce?
- Pfft.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.329
Nobody actually eats it.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.860
Hey! It's not Christmas
without cranberry sauce!

06:16.930 --> 06:19.270
So one of you better go get some pronto.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.100
And you're gonna need
to dig through this

06:21.110 --> 06:22.750
to see if you can find
anything worth saving.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.140
Ugh. Um.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.240
Guys!! We... we need to
talk about this, okay?

06:27.850 --> 06:29.480
Wait. Did...

06:29.550 --> 06:32.120
did you just go out and
slaughter a wild turkey?

06:32.180 --> 06:34.850
Like I'm gonna feed my
girls store-bought. Mm-mm.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.120
No, you can't avoid
this with "guiblets."

06:38.190 --> 06:40.460
- Even really gross giblets.
- Look, you...

06:40.530 --> 06:42.960
you're my miracle baby.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.059
And what better time of year

06:45.060 --> 06:48.180
to tell her about it than JC's birthday?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.600
Please, Mama. I...

06:51.670 --> 06:53.900
I've been waiting long enough.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.870
Who is my father?

06:57.880 --> 06:59.940
Fine. Okay, pull up a chair.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.110
Oh, my God... this is happening.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.280
Oh!

07:09.820 --> 07:12.020
We were in love.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.060
His name was Julian.

07:14.890 --> 07:16.930
And he was everything that Ward wasn't.

07:16.940 --> 07:19.980
He was kind, honest.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.900
Sobre.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.700
Until he left without saying goodbye.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.340
Still, I don't regret the affair.

07:28.410 --> 07:31.510
Especially because nine months later,

07:31.580 --> 07:33.710
I got my Waverly.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.580
You were born out of love, sweetie.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.440
The kind of love that
ditches a pregnant woman?

07:41.540 --> 07:43.180
You never tried to find him?

07:44.780 --> 07:46.259
Kind of had my hands full with the demon

07:46.260 --> 07:48.460
that arrived after you were born.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.330
A demon that we beat together.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.470
I don't feel like an angel.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.670
I guess Bobo could've been lying.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.239
Bobo Del Rey?

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
Is that sonofabitch still around?

08:05.740 --> 08:07.700
He was there the night you were born.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.680
What? He was?

08:10.550 --> 08:13.500
Oh, man, I gotta go. A kid went missing.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.490
On Christmas? Well, go bring them home.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.160
I plan to.

08:29.630 --> 08:30.630
Please.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.320
Please, Mama.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.110
No. I just want to spend
the night with my girls.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.370
I don't want to get lost in
the Ghosts of Christmas past.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.679
I just want to eat some turkey.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.179
I'm vegan.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.179
You're already a lesbian.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.850
Speaking of which, is Nicole
gonna join us for dinner?

08:46.420 --> 08:47.550
Yes.

08:48.190 --> 08:52.190
And, uh, maybe I could invite Dad too?

08:52.590 --> 08:55.060
- You got his number?
- No, I don't.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.499
But if either of you two
know where Bobo is,

08:57.500 --> 08:58.929
maybe you could ask him.

08:58.930 --> 09:01.170
I'm assuming that he's
still the same sonofabitch

09:01.180 --> 09:02.780
that he was back when
I used to know him?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.900
Oh, yeah, he's a total shit.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.600
- Whoo-ee!
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no!

09:07.670 --> 09:10.280
Out, out. And get rid of the
needles in the hallway.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.940
I can already feel the vice
tightening up around my sinuses.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.099
Well, it was intended
as a festive gesture,

09:15.100 --> 09:17.009
hoping to brighten up the place.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.950
Well, you know, I'm not feeling
very festive right now.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.560
Is that why you got rid
of your moustache?

09:27.630 --> 09:29.579
Maybe you need to find yourself

09:29.580 --> 09:31.880
a handsome gentleman to
get into the spirit with?

09:31.900 --> 09:34.160
No. A: My mood has nothing
to do with guys, okay?

09:34.170 --> 09:36.439
I-I passed the Bechdel
test with flying colours.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.760
A whole rainbow of them.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.370
- What?
- Exactly.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.940
Look, it's been my experience that, uh,

09:45.010 --> 09:47.580
romantic entanglements...

09:47.650 --> 09:49.580
they can alleviate all
kinds of stressors.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.460
Okay, well... we don't all have

09:51.470 --> 09:53.439
a Black-Friday-stand-
ing-outside-of-Best-Buy

09:53.440 --> 09:55.089
amount of people fawning over us.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.590
Okay, I am trying here, Jeremy,
but these references...

09:57.600 --> 10:00.960
Rosita, Kate the vampire,
Wynonna freaking Earp.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.860
Yeah, I... I couldn't even get
one dude to call me back.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.430
Robin didn't call.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.840
He didn't call.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.800
May I give you some well-worn advice?

10:14.870 --> 10:16.610
You be direct.

10:16.670 --> 10:18.680
You ask for what you want.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.880
It is Christmas, after all.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.880
Thanks, Doc.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.880
Okay.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.300
Be direct. Be direct.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.500
Okay.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.690
Don't... No! Ah!!

11:08.730 --> 11:10.790
- Your name?
- Timothy.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.560
- Your family name?
- McBlake.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.100
Oh, dear.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.500
I'm afraid you made the naughty list.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.940
No! No, don't put me in there! No!

11:38.970 --> 11:41.679
Guys, I completely
understand your concern.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.340
Really, I promise, we are
doing the best that we can.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.650
I'll... be right with you.
Just one second.

11:47.950 --> 11:50.800
What, no marshmallows? Not like
there's a kid missing, huh?

11:52.350 --> 11:54.220
Alright. Hang in there.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.220
Okay.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.990
It's bad, okay?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
He's taking it really hard,

12:02.001 --> 12:03.200
because he was there when it happened.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.010
- When what happened?
- That's what we'd like to know!

12:05.030 --> 12:06.416
Just keep walking, back towards the lot.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.600
Charlie'll fill you in on the rest.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.300
Charlie?

12:10.770 --> 12:13.210
Sir, I really need you...
Just calm down.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.380
We need to get this kid back.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.550
It's Christmas.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.990
Totally.

12:29.190 --> 12:31.630
Uh, hi. Wynonna Earp.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.630
Charlie. Fire Services.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.300
That's your last name?

12:39.140 --> 12:40.300
Okay.

12:42.540 --> 12:46.570
I mean... it's way too much for a kid.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.010
It's staged to make it look
like he's dead. So, really,

12:50.080 --> 12:53.960
totally acceptable environment
in which to make jokes.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.250
Could be animal for all we know.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.720
Yeah, li-like that Sherlock story.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.060
Bunch of blood turned
out to be from a dog?

13:04.230 --> 13:06.330
I'll take it to my guy for testing.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.860
You have a guy?

13:07.930 --> 13:10.500
Uh... just part of my team.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.570
You... you have a... a team?

13:13.040 --> 13:15.170
A whole posse, actually.

13:17.010 --> 13:18.670
Whoa! Look out!

13:19.780 --> 13:22.180
Oh, thanks.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.510
That's not usually my thing,
being saved. I do the saving.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.350
I saw the branch... took action.

13:33.860 --> 13:36.360
This strain shouldn't
grow this far north.

13:37.190 --> 13:38.860
You into trees, too?

13:38.930 --> 13:42.060
Fire-hall library had
some books on arborism.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.400
- Now...
- Thanks.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.970
About this, uh, this team?

13:50.870 --> 13:52.270
Yo, nerdzilla.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.980
Oh. Aw, you brought me coffee.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.210
Inside. We need it tested.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.880
If it's fresh? If it's human?
Full science-guy mark-up.

14:00.950 --> 14:01.950
Ah, yes, sure. Okay,

14:01.951 --> 14:03.619
I'll call up my blood-splatter analyst,

14:03.620 --> 14:05.780
behavioural profiler and Helen
Mirren to see what's up.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.459
You're gonna have to forgive

14:08.460 --> 14:10.399
his Ebenezer-esque demeanour.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.740
He is still smarting from a
romantic disappointment.

14:12.970 --> 14:14.880
Okay, a kid is missing.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.220
And we don't talk about
Helen Mirren in that tone.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.280
- Okay.
- Waves.

14:19.350 --> 14:23.760
Uh, I need... you to check
a last name, McBlake,

14:23.770 --> 14:25.239
and cross-reference it with the VIP

14:25.240 --> 14:26.689
townspeople the vamps were after.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.730
McBlake. Tim McBlake?

14:28.790 --> 14:31.230
Yeah, no, their family's
been in Purgatory forever.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.120
I think they were
originally prospectors.

14:33.180 --> 14:35.870
Great. Thanks. Uh, how's Mom?

14:38.970 --> 14:41.740
Elbows deep in turkey guts. Yeah.

14:41.810 --> 14:43.219
I should get back to her.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.740
Okay.

14:44.770 --> 14:45.770
Uh, no, please don't.

14:45.810 --> 14:48.910
Old family, so this is
most likely Bulshar.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.580
Pardon? Who-shar?

14:51.480 --> 14:53.250
Just a gu... guy.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.190
Uh, huge dick.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.319
He is a huge dick.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.340
I-I don't know about
his size... down there.

15:00.390 --> 15:02.260
- He's probably an innie.
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.979
- Uh, he's not super great.
- Uh-huh.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.330
He's a fella who holds a
grudge against this town

15:07.340 --> 15:10.000
and those who've lived here
longer than a few weeks.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.339
So the kid that was taken is from a

15:12.340 --> 15:14.280
family that's been in
Purgatory for decades.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.520
Wait, wait. Robin's family too!

15:16.800 --> 15:18.756
He mentioned it, that his
dad would never leave town,

15:18.780 --> 15:20.160
because they've been here forever.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.699
It means I wasn't ghosted!

15:21.700 --> 15:24.000
My date was just kidnapped
by Bulshar, maybe!

15:24.880 --> 15:26.300
Huzzah.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.520
Go test the blood.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.710
- Yes.
- Great.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.799
Doc, we need to find
someone who knows more

15:30.800 --> 15:33.080
about why Bulshar was going
after first families.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.090
- That's a good idea.
- Thank you.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.430
You know anyone like that?

15:38.230 --> 15:40.259
Large incisors? Someone...

15:40.260 --> 15:42.819
you married... one time?

15:42.820 --> 15:45.870
Yes, we may speak with my wife.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.510
You guys are wild. Hm.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.250
You finally came.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.670
Doc Holliday. And Wyatt's
great-granddaughter.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.179
You're missing a "great", Kate.

16:08.180 --> 16:10.220
N-not an intentional rhyme.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.839
We're on the clock, plus...

16:11.840 --> 16:14.200
I don't need an invitation
to enter places.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.860
Doc, too, can enter wherever he wants.

16:15.940 --> 16:19.750
We are here for information
on the vampire pack.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.219
I'll provide whatever I can.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.939
Okay. So what's the deal

16:22.940 --> 16:25.480
with Otto and Company's whole VIP thing?

16:25.540 --> 16:27.480
All we knew was to
separate the descendants

16:27.490 --> 16:30.260
of the first families of Purgatory
from all the residents.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.360
And we couldn't kill any.
Bulshar needed them.

16:33.430 --> 16:35.930
- For what?
- That, I don't know.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.760
Bullshit.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.599
Wynonna, please go easy.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.220
She's obviously gone through a lot.

16:43.260 --> 16:45.700
She's been taken by
vampires, turned into one.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.140
She's a victim.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.910
I'm the same as the day I met you.

16:55.950 --> 16:57.480
Pfft.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.220
You mean to tell me...

16:59.280 --> 17:01.180
Queen of the Damned,
meet King of the Dense.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.520
The vamp was calling
from inside the house.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.730
Why didn't you tell me?

17:06.790 --> 17:09.560
I did. Many times.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.300
"Doc, I'm a vampire.

17:11.369 --> 17:14.799
Doc, I drink blood.
Doc, let me bite you."

17:14.800 --> 17:16.156
Yeah, I thought that was role playing.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.009
Oh, gag reflex getting swole over here.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.910
You don't remember.

17:20.970 --> 17:24.160
Do you not remember how
much opium we would smoke?

17:24.980 --> 17:26.858
Wouldn't be good opium if I could.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.619
And it's why I never had,

17:29.620 --> 17:32.060
or never could have, photos taken.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.399
And why I got my girl Sally

17:34.400 --> 17:36.880
to pose as the outlaw Big Nose Kate.

17:38.990 --> 17:42.200
You said that was so the law
could not identify you.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.060
Or because vampires can't
be captured on film.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.540
Pretty smart, Big Nose.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.999
Nicknamed after my
specialty in the boudoir.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I was famous for it.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.300
So why did you leave when I got sick?

17:58.750 --> 18:00.720
I couldn't bear to see you like that.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.550
And then I got word you'd died. So...

18:03.620 --> 18:05.960
I reunited with my
undead family in Europe.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.800
Not a day went by I didn't
think of you, though.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.460
The nights that turned into mornings,

18:11.530 --> 18:13.390
our bodies, the passion...

18:13.400 --> 18:16.060
Ah, okay, I'm officially
gonna need a bucket.

18:16.130 --> 18:17.600
Great chat, you two.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.630
I also was a friend of Wyatt's, Wynonna.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.700
I could be of some service.

18:21.770 --> 18:23.570
Uh, no new team members, but thanks.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.270
Enjoy squatting in my
friend's house. That's cool.

18:26.340 --> 18:28.470
You forgot this the other night.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.520
Was that really necessary?

18:39.600 --> 18:41.780
It's her friend's house?

18:43.560 --> 18:45.360
She'll warm up to you.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.720
And what about you?
When will you warm up?

18:49.300 --> 18:51.600
She may not need you, Doc, but I do.

18:53.070 --> 18:55.570
You seem to think I'm an angel.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.000
Tell me about the night I was born.

18:59.010 --> 19:00.470
Oh...

19:03.380 --> 19:05.080
That was a happy day.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.220
I was on a dig when I heard screaming

19:10.260 --> 19:12.300
coming from the Gibson greenhouse.

19:13.020 --> 19:15.860
- It was Michelle.
- He should be here.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.320
He should be here. He should be here.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.360
Where's Julian?! He
needs to protect her!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.630
If you hurt her, I'll... I swear...

19:26.170 --> 19:28.019
Please. Please...

19:28.020 --> 19:30.320
save the baby. Save Waverly.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.210
Waverly?

19:38.580 --> 19:40.910
I knew...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.980
when I saw you...

19:44.220 --> 19:46.720
... when I heard your name...

19:46.790 --> 19:50.260
you... were different.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.630
Michelle had lost a lot of blood.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.800
She passed out.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.660
And so I took you...

19:58.500 --> 19:59.639
... to him.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.700
Ward?!

20:04.270 --> 20:05.810
Ward Earp.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.410
What the hell do you want?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.350
This is for you.

20:15.050 --> 20:16.819
Get that thing away from me.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.820
It's not mine.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.160
You will take this baby.
You will care for it.

20:29.230 --> 20:32.160
And if I find out you've
hurt this angel...

20:32.230 --> 20:35.570
I will come for you. And I...

20:37.640 --> 20:39.100
... will kill you.

20:43.110 --> 20:44.879
You're my hero, Bobo.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.140
Or at least you
sure make yourself seem like one.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.250
But you're leaving out
one important detail.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.919
Yeah? What's that?

20:51.920 --> 20:54.690
You just coincidentally
end up at the greenhouse

20:54.750 --> 20:56.620
the night my dad goes missing.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.030
Missing... for some.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.560
What?

21:07.470 --> 21:09.559
You know where Julian is?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.239
Is he still in the Triangle?

21:11.240 --> 21:12.579
Oh...

21:12.580 --> 21:14.140
Alive?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.240
Story time's over, little girl.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.159
And that's information you get

21:20.160 --> 21:21.940
when I find myself topside.

21:24.020 --> 21:25.999
If there's one thing I've
learned in this life...

21:26.000 --> 21:27.050
Yeah.

21:27.060 --> 21:29.860
- ... it's that I'm done playing your games.
- Oh.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.890
You're right, Bobo. Story time's over.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.230
No.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.200
Hold up.

21:39.270 --> 21:41.570
What?! You gonna tell me about
the time you had a three-way

21:41.580 --> 21:43.159
with Amelia Earhart and Laura Ingalls?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.160
Wynonna!

21:47.310 --> 21:50.510
It's bad luck to refuse a kiss
underneath the mistletoe.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.700
You waiting for one or you offering?

21:53.740 --> 21:55.680
The offer is always there.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.330
Huh. Well, maybe you should
stick to kissing your wife.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.760
I have not been with her in a century.

22:03.620 --> 22:07.330
Oh... so your knife was at her place

22:07.340 --> 22:09.130
because your dishwasher was broken?

22:10.700 --> 22:12.560
It is not my jam to be the other woman.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.140
Dammit, Wynonna, you're not
the other woman! You're...

22:18.340 --> 22:20.110
... another woman.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.240
What does that mean?

22:22.310 --> 22:26.110
It means she was my
wife and now you're...

22:27.550 --> 22:30.350
... someone I shared something
even greater with.

22:30.420 --> 22:33.090
More than just romance.
I mean, we had a baby.

22:46.370 --> 22:48.719
Isn't it time that we
stopped being scared

22:48.720 --> 22:50.720
and started being honest
with one another?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.059
Honestly, I don't know
what to do with you.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.060
You could admit you love me.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.980
Let's just get back to work.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.560
I was right there and
I couldn't save him.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.900
I froze. I never freeze.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.730
You have been cooped up in here all day.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.339
The kid's not the only
one who's missing.

23:22.340 --> 23:23.639
We really need you out there.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.879
Why? There's nothing we can do.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.509
We got no money, we got no clue.

23:26.510 --> 23:28.310
We got help.

23:28.380 --> 23:31.100
People don't just disappear, even here.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.820
We should have a whole
team combing those woods.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.020
What's the point? To bring them home?

23:37.020 --> 23:38.480
To Purgatory?

23:40.150 --> 23:42.220
Where bad things just happen?

23:46.930 --> 23:49.239
Nicole, a couple weeks ago,

23:49.240 --> 23:51.240
I saw vampires bite Lonnie's head off,

23:51.260 --> 23:53.300
and the next night I
binged-watched an entire season

23:53.370 --> 23:56.400
of Pretty Little Liars like
nothing ever happened.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.800
But this...

23:59.840 --> 24:01.370
Look.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.280
Something changed in that tree lot.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.150
I c-can't snap out of it.

24:07.050 --> 24:10.280
You have to. You're the sheriff.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.580
Tim!

24:18.680 --> 24:21.020
- Tim!
- Tim!

24:22.120 --> 24:24.860
- Tim!
- Tim!

24:27.360 --> 24:28.940
Tim!

24:31.020 --> 24:33.939
Okay, Tim, come out! Come back!

24:33.940 --> 24:35.940
Tim!

24:52.790 --> 24:56.260
Oh, no! No! No.

24:56.330 --> 24:59.030
Ah! Oh!

25:05.840 --> 25:06.940
Watch.

25:07.470 --> 25:11.240
Just as your ancestors
watched my final moments.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.310
Ah! Ah! Oh!

25:45.340 --> 25:47.080
Wait. So you're saying he's alive.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.520
Well, the vampires cannot kill

25:48.540 --> 25:50.339
the first families. This much we know.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.890
So the boy and, yes, Robin, could be...

25:52.900 --> 25:54.170
- Ah...
- Yes, but...

25:54.220 --> 25:55.220
we still need to figure out

25:55.221 --> 25:56.709
where Bulshar is keeping them.

25:56.710 --> 25:58.199
Do the petals help?

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
Ah, well, they don't grow in the forest,

26:00.300 --> 26:03.050
or anywhere naturally around here.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.520
But they are one of the
many fragrant flowers

26:05.590 --> 26:07.179
that are often planted near factories

26:07.180 --> 26:08.500
that produce noxious odours.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.739
Like at a butcher shop?

26:09.740 --> 26:11.980
Remember that blood you
found in the forest?

26:12.080 --> 26:14.319
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Well, it wasn't from a kid.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.199
It was from pigs.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.160
I saw Carrie, I know what's up.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.879
Isn't there an abattoir
off of Rural Road 3?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.840
Yeah. And a smelting
plant on Highway 12.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.819
Or the hog farm on Wellburne.

26:24.820 --> 26:27.050
Alright then, let's saddle
up. Abattoir first.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.740
Why go together? Time
is... crucial, right?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.540
Well, because it's dangerous.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.480
Uh, I don't need protecting.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.539
What's important is we check each place

26:35.540 --> 26:36.619
and then radio for help

26:36.620 --> 26:38.750
once we confirm our
people are there. Right?

26:38.820 --> 26:40.390
If that's what you want.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.540
Tiny Tim.

26:49.630 --> 26:55.860
Your great-great-great-
grandfather betrayed me.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.580
Did you know that?

26:58.470 --> 27:00.570
The other families betrayed me, too.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.340
They disgust me.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.610
You disgust me.

27:06.450 --> 27:10.250
Is that why he sold
me out to Wyatt Earp?

27:11.750 --> 27:14.199
Why he gave him the keys
to the sheriff's office

27:14.200 --> 27:16.440
so they could ambush me?

27:16.490 --> 27:20.130
So I could end up in the
ground for a century?!

27:24.970 --> 27:26.900
I'm next.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.840
- It's my turn.
- Jett...

27:29.900 --> 27:31.540
the milliner.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.810
You and I gonna do this,
or what, cue ball?

27:35.610 --> 27:36.910
Now.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.680
Later.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.220
No! No!

27:51.730 --> 27:53.490
Death...

27:53.560 --> 27:55.900
has come for all of you.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.330
It's okay, dude. It'll be alright.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.570
It's gonna be alright.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.080
Lemme guess: super-duper locked?

28:15.150 --> 28:17.740
- What are you doing here?
- Jeremy texted me the address.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.950
Huh.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.699
Oh. come on.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.850
Don't you think you'd know if
I was supernatural by now?

28:24.860 --> 28:26.336
Who said anything about supernatural?

28:26.360 --> 28:27.439
The killer branch?

28:27.440 --> 28:30.059
The guy we're chasing
whose name is "Bulshar"?

28:30.060 --> 28:31.820
Don't exactly get that
from a Baby Name Book.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.770
Still. Humour me.

28:49.850 --> 28:52.350
Okey-dokey. You are just a man.

28:52.420 --> 28:53.920
Just a man...

28:53.990 --> 28:55.820
standing in front of a marshal,

28:56.190 --> 28:58.930
asking her to let him help
rescue a bunch of people.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.439
Chains around both doors.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.580
Any chance you brought
a big ol' fire axe?

29:05.630 --> 29:08.100
I did. And I've got a big hose.

29:35.330 --> 29:37.760
Merry Christmas, you filthy animals.

29:39.170 --> 29:42.769
Ho, ho, hold my calls while
I kick some honeycomb ass.

29:42.770 --> 29:44.970
- Who you talking to?
- I'm not sure.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.540
Oh, hurry up.

29:49.550 --> 29:52.280
- Right here, right here.
- Free us. Help us.

29:52.350 --> 29:55.110
Get me out of here.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.050
Good.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.299
Thanks for your help.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.560
My pleasure. It's what I do.

30:03.590 --> 30:06.190
Yeah, yeah, I get it. You save people.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.579
Where were you with a pun

30:08.580 --> 30:10.659
or a one-liner when I could've used one?

30:10.660 --> 30:13.430
How about, like, uh...

30:13.500 --> 30:16.240
you think I could be a keeper?

30:17.680 --> 30:19.469
Maybe leave the wit to Wynonna, huh?

30:19.470 --> 30:21.070
Yeah, fair enough.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.750
My dude.

30:27.210 --> 30:28.810
Alright.

30:28.880 --> 30:32.060
Now... where's the big guy?

30:32.220 --> 30:34.150
Bulshar got out.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.590
Huh.

30:39.660 --> 30:42.230
- Oh, my God.
- Let's get you guys cleaned up.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.830
Yeah.

30:44.900 --> 30:47.130
Oh. Mom.

30:52.910 --> 30:55.340
Looks like Santa came early this year.

30:55.410 --> 30:58.840
For once, Mrs. Claus wasn't,
like: "What about me?"

30:58.910 --> 31:01.180
Maybe not the right vibe?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.179
Alright. You're right.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.180
Premature e-joke-lation on my part.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.760
Hey.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.330
Ah, you shaved the 'stache.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.960
Uh, yeah, I... I thought
you didn't like it.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.370
No, I got... kidnapped
by zombie beekeepers.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.060
Okay, that was my second guess.

31:23.670 --> 31:25.200
I mean, uh, you wouldn't have ghosted

31:25.270 --> 31:27.179
if you weren't kidnapped, right?

31:27.180 --> 31:28.839
Totally cool if you would have.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.279
I just want to read the signals.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.340
I just want... I want to try something.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.290
- So?
- Yeah.

31:41.350 --> 31:43.890
- Christmas dinner, my place?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.730
Uh... but... my family.

31:46.790 --> 31:49.460
- Oh, no, of course, of course.
- But how about Boxing Day?

31:49.530 --> 31:51.530
Leftover tofurkey burritos it is.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.530
Alright.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.740
Well... good teamwork there, buddy.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.880
- Like I'm on the team.
- Well, you're team-adjacent.

31:59.940 --> 32:01.740
And that depends if you rat me out.

32:01.810 --> 32:03.880
- For what?
- This.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.390
Hey.

32:19.640 --> 32:23.400
So you were a good elf
today. Better than good.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.600
I'm just glad everybody's safe.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.740
And I was a bad Santa.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.340
And not the funny kind,

32:33.410 --> 32:35.640
where Santa blasphemes a whole lot.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.480
I was bad at my job.

32:39.010 --> 32:42.410
- Hey, no. It happens to all of us.
- Not to me.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.820
And it's not gonna happen again.

32:50.140 --> 32:53.160
Ah. Do I get to be Santa next year?

32:53.230 --> 32:55.860
No. No, Nicole.

33:01.770 --> 33:03.240
I'm retiring.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.800
Nobody leaves this table
till you pop a button!

33:11.900 --> 33:14.190
Mm. Yum.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.460
So you okay, or... ?

33:17.530 --> 33:19.480
You said you were gonna call if...

33:19.520 --> 33:22.360
Oh, Charlie was there. It was fine.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.440
So that is that, then?

33:29.910 --> 33:32.080
I can't believe we're all
together for Christmas.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.380
- Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Well, most of us.

33:36.150 --> 33:37.880
Hey, to...

33:39.080 --> 33:40.750
... to fallen comrades.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.790
To the brave.

33:46.390 --> 33:49.030
Ooh! To Sheriff Nicole Haught.

33:49.090 --> 33:52.100
Ah, Nicky Nicky Nine Door! Come on.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.060
Okay, Nicole, it... it's fine.

33:54.130 --> 33:57.330
Mm. Uh... to not getting ghosted.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.970
- Hey.
- Hey-oh.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.400
To the reappearance of
Jeremy's upper lip.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.040
You look... you look handsome.

34:05.410 --> 34:06.880
Excuse me.

34:08.550 --> 34:10.810
- I have to go.
- On Christmas?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.100
This is the part where you
go after him, numbnuts.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.489
I found the gravy boat!

34:19.560 --> 34:22.060
You're not going anywhere
before we have more turkey.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.259
- No, ma'am.
- Mm.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.820
Michelle, this is delicious. Thank you.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.530
Well, thank you, Nicole.

34:29.330 --> 34:32.270
And for thank you making
my Waverly so happy.

34:32.340 --> 34:35.040
Well, I've always known
she was an angel.

34:35.969 --> 34:39.139
Maybe I should've made
Bobo tell me where Dad is.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.076
You know, I could've shot
him in the kneecap...

34:41.100 --> 34:42.280
No.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.080
You shouldn't have.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.320
Because you focused on what was here,

34:47.489 --> 34:49.219
around this table.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.860
You made this your family.

34:54.330 --> 34:57.880
I look around and I am so...

34:57.900 --> 35:01.400
I'm so damn proud of what...

35:01.470 --> 35:03.870
you two girls created.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.359
I wasn't there...

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
but you made this your family.

35:20.820 --> 35:23.290
This family ain't perfect.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.690
And that's what's so great about it.

35:37.030 --> 35:39.070
You know, you should just, uh...

35:39.140 --> 35:41.440
fill up the sink just to save water.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.720
That way...

35:42.740 --> 35:44.459
You want to give the
dishes a dirty bath?

35:44.460 --> 35:46.460
Uh-uh.

35:46.910 --> 35:49.559
Right. Guess they didn't screen An

35:49.560 --> 35:51.519
Inconvenient Truth at
the mental institution.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.039
Which is fair.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.649
Nicole!

35:54.650 --> 35:56.159
What is important to me today

35:56.160 --> 35:58.560
is saving you some time. You
are officially dismissed.

35:59.060 --> 36:00.660
Go after your man.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.000
My baby daddy is...

36:05.060 --> 36:06.830
married to a vampire.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.330
That's a Harlequin I'd read.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.900
And I still don't think I deserve him.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.670
Of course you do.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.940
Wynonna, don't settle, like I did.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.410
We can find Julian if you want.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.399
Yeah, we could put
Peacemaker on Bobo and

36:27.400 --> 36:29.560
make him tell us everything he knows.

36:29.590 --> 36:31.419
But wherever he is, the fact is

36:31.420 --> 36:33.000
he ditched you the day you gave birth,

36:33.040 --> 36:37.430
so, you know, if we find
him... got words.

36:41.370 --> 36:43.100
You've got us now, Mama.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.910
I'm just gonna go out for a bit.

36:51.980 --> 36:55.510
Not gonna say where I'm going or
to see who or to do... do what.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.079
You're a grown woman.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.660
You make up your own
mind now. We all do.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.590
Love you, Mama.

37:21.410 --> 37:22.910
That was fun.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.610
Was it?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.480
No, it was awful.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.350
Thought you'd be more freaked out.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.020
Well, this town's got a
bit of a reputation.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.000
Besides... we saved them.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.390
There will be more.

37:41.630 --> 37:44.030
But what am I gonna do, give up?

37:44.830 --> 37:47.160
Lie down and scream while I wait?

37:48.830 --> 37:50.730
Unless someone makes me.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.259
Your ability to shift from

37:55.260 --> 37:57.260
one inappropriate thought to the next...

37:57.640 --> 37:59.939
- It's a gift.
- It's really something.

38:04.780 --> 38:07.180
- This you flirting?
- I mean...

38:08.300 --> 38:09.650
Sure.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.360
Bad breakup?

38:14.860 --> 38:16.630
Massive trust issues, too.

38:17.530 --> 38:19.260
Ah, well, I like a challenge.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.710
No strings. I can't do that right now.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.910
Does that work?

38:33.980 --> 38:35.680
Let's find out.

38:49.830 --> 38:52.900
You shouldn't have told
Waverly those things.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.630
Oh, hi, Michelle.

38:58.340 --> 38:59.700
I brought you some dinner.

39:00.910 --> 39:03.270
Nothing comes free from Earp women.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.810
You know where he is? Julian?

39:07.510 --> 39:09.250
What's in it for me?

39:23.640 --> 39:26.900
Mm... it's too much tryptophan!

39:27.700 --> 39:29.600
Trypto-what-now?

39:31.410 --> 39:34.440
- Ta-dah!
- Fan... tastic.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.440
Baby, what's going on?

39:36.510 --> 39:38.210
Well...

39:38.280 --> 39:40.750
I, uh, I wanted to say
sorry for earlier.

39:40.810 --> 39:43.020
I was preoccupied with
my own stuff, you know,

39:43.040 --> 39:45.699
that I couldn't properly
celebrate your big news.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.390
- Oh.
- So...

39:48.220 --> 39:51.160
... Sheriff Nicole Haught...

39:51.630 --> 39:53.390
... let me make it up to you.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.360
♪ Oh I love you love you love you ♪

39:58.430 --> 40:00.070
♪ More each year ♪

40:00.130 --> 40:03.000
♪ They could strip away the cheer ♪

40:03.070 --> 40:05.600
♪ I'd still be standing here ♪

40:05.670 --> 40:08.070
Do you hate it?

40:08.140 --> 40:11.380
No! I don't hate it. Of course I don't.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.839
Okay, here, put that on.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.260
Here.

40:14.450 --> 40:16.480
- How's this?
- Good.

40:16.550 --> 40:19.780
♪ Oh you gave me gave me gave me ♪

40:19.820 --> 40:21.590
♪ The greatest gift ♪

40:21.660 --> 40:23.960
♪ I can strike it off my list ♪

40:24.340 --> 40:27.760
♪ I no longer need to wait ♪

40:47.180 --> 40:48.880
What do you mean, he attacked you?

40:48.950 --> 40:50.380
Not him.

40:51.020 --> 40:52.620
I fought them off.

40:52.690 --> 40:54.350
His beekeepers?

40:55.120 --> 40:57.360
Came to collect fealty, I gather.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
You are gonna be fine.

41:12.510 --> 41:14.710
If he finds out who I am...

41:17.140 --> 41:18.580
I'm here now.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.310
You are, aren't you?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.320
I need you, Doc.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.660
Say that again.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.190
I need you so bad it hurts.

41:33.260 --> 41:36.060
I will do anything in
my power to help you.

41:40.070 --> 41:41.330
Anything?

41:42.240 --> 41:45.540
There's only one thing that
can cure this affliction.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.310
The only thing.

41:48.780 --> 41:50.780
But there's a cost to being a saviour.

41:52.180 --> 41:54.480
It would make me immortal again.

41:54.550 --> 41:56.680
Oh, but we can't do that.

41:56.750 --> 42:00.090
You're happy here with...
with these people.

42:01.190 --> 42:03.120
You belong with them, not with my kind.

42:03.190 --> 42:04.690
Cut the shit, Countessa.

42:05.760 --> 42:08.260
- Are you sure?
- Stop pretending...

42:10.560 --> 42:13.100
... that this isn't what
you came here for.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.940
You might feel a prick.

42:27.380 --> 42:30.420
Merry Christmas to me.
