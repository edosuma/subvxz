WEBVTT

00:00.056 --> 00:02.119
I know these alleyways too.

00:02.174 --> 00:04.142
Ran from my share of police
back in the day.

00:04.179 --> 00:05.873
The hair sample from the Hanley murder.

00:05.976 --> 00:07.365
I think you brought it to Mercer,

00:07.402 --> 00:08.965
and he told you to bury it.

00:09.048 --> 00:12.517
I need you to hack into this.
It was my father's.

00:12.618 --> 00:15.112
The security system has a login
menu that takes a picture

00:15.149 --> 00:16.760
of whoever's trying
to access the profile.

00:16.797 --> 00:19.332
The hacker must have been
interrupted before they saw that.

00:19.411 --> 00:22.227
- We should split up.
- Noah! Wait!

00:22.328 --> 00:24.329
A few in-patient units
I've found in Winnipeg.

00:24.430 --> 00:25.397
<i>It's not that simple,</i>

00:25.498 --> 00:27.590
<i>you need more than
a diagnosis to get in.</i>

00:27.669 --> 00:29.137
Unless he's a danger to himself

00:29.174 --> 00:30.939
<i>or a danger to other people.</i>

00:32.685 --> 00:35.875
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO
TO ME, BILLY?! BILLY!

00:35.915 --> 00:37.511
You would have done anything for him.

00:37.548 --> 00:39.347
For the movement.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.468
<i>Hello?</i>

00:48.505 --> 00:49.905
You haven't returned my calls.

00:49.941 --> 00:51.559
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm in the city.</i>

00:51.596 --> 00:54.254
- When can you get back here?
- <i>Why? What happened?</i>

00:54.291 --> 00:55.992
I think I know who killed my father.

00:56.561 --> 00:57.768
Who?

00:57.869 --> 01:00.103
Not over the phone.
I don't know who's listening.

01:00.204 --> 01:02.898
- Can you prove it?
- <i>We have to figure out a way</i>

01:02.985 --> 01:06.683
- before a jury convicts Luna.
- The trial starts tomorrow.

01:06.770 --> 01:08.779
Then you better hurry back.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.650 --> 01:47.286
Oh, hey, excuse me.

01:47.323 --> 01:50.158
I'm still waiting to get in
to see Shane Crawford.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.382
It's not a good time
for him to have visitors.

01:52.523 --> 01:55.143
You know, I only have a few minutes,
I gotta get back to work.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.564
- We're taking care of him.
- It's just... this might be

01:57.601 --> 01:59.788
the last time I can
get here for a while.

01:59.935 --> 02:02.937
- Another time.
- I just need to explain...

02:04.597 --> 02:07.894
- I just need two minutes.
- Mr. Crawford, the truth is,

02:07.931 --> 02:10.073
your brother doesn't want to see you.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.359
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

02:29.592 --> 02:32.596
I told you to be better
than everyone else,

02:32.697 --> 02:34.464
that wasn't fair.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.033
It doesn't matter how hard we try

02:39.224 --> 02:41.216
or how good we are.

02:41.279 --> 02:45.208
Stats say half of us
are gonna end up in jail.

02:48.228 --> 02:50.226
There's this...

02:50.636 --> 02:53.404
this young woman on trial.

02:53.861 --> 02:56.820
She's facing a lot of years and...

02:59.101 --> 03:00.657
...and she needs help.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.806
I need you to tell me

03:03.141 --> 03:05.662
about the night
your father disappeared.

03:09.573 --> 03:12.469
Nothing is gonna change
unless we change it.

03:12.653 --> 03:14.292
There's no "we", Officer.

03:14.348 --> 03:17.860
Kip, I grew up in that building.

03:18.609 --> 03:20.476
You're one of them.

03:21.992 --> 03:23.993
Tell me what happened.

03:26.299 --> 03:28.385
Don't walk away from me!

03:29.775 --> 03:33.377
You know what happened?
He got a new heart medication.

03:33.524 --> 03:34.911
Made him all confused.

03:35.028 --> 03:37.379
The police treat him like he was drunk!

03:39.232 --> 03:41.800
My dad never drank.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.624
He was good.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.048
What did the police do?

03:50.105 --> 03:52.106
I tell you, then you're gonna
do the same thing to me.

03:52.143 --> 03:54.244
No, I won't.

03:55.734 --> 03:58.369
She's mine. The one on trial,

03:58.716 --> 04:00.617
she's my girl.

04:01.845 --> 04:03.179
Luna.

04:03.398 --> 04:05.145
Remember your manners, it'll count.

04:05.216 --> 04:07.796
They're gonna decide on the
evidence, not my manners.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.579
<i>When your uncle Terry was on trial,</i>

04:09.616 --> 04:11.664
<i>he was really rude to the jury.</i>

04:12.238 --> 04:14.539
Mom, Uncle Terry is rude to everybody.

04:14.725 --> 04:17.127
I'm just saying, be polite.

04:17.379 --> 04:20.307
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- By the water.

04:20.646 --> 04:23.329
Where we used to go
after getting ice cream.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.449
How does the sky look?

04:25.627 --> 04:27.227
Luna...

04:27.471 --> 04:29.795
Mom, what if I don't get out of here?

04:29.832 --> 04:32.800
- You can't think like that.
- <i>An all-white jury.</i>

04:32.861 --> 04:34.784
Physical evidence all points to me.

04:34.971 --> 04:37.115
It's kind of hard not to.

04:37.488 --> 04:38.538
A guilty verdict,

04:38.574 --> 04:42.086
and I'm not out of here until I'm 45.

04:42.902 --> 04:45.292
<i>You won't forget about me, will you?</i>

04:46.599 --> 04:48.869
I'll "make me
a willow cabinet at your gate",

04:48.982 --> 04:51.684
and I'll call upon my soul
in the house."

04:51.936 --> 04:53.737
<i>It's from Shakespeare.</i>

04:53.838 --> 04:55.504
<i>They never let us read our own people,</i>

04:55.541 --> 04:57.242
<i>just a bunch of dead British guys,</i>

04:57.291 --> 04:59.526
but that one always stuck with me.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.680
It means I'm not going anywhere, baby.

05:07.604 --> 05:10.287
<i>Those old British guys,
they like to use a lot of words.</i>

05:12.044 --> 05:15.680
Time, Ms. Spence.

05:19.363 --> 05:21.064
I gotta go.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.734
<i>Kis√¢kihitin.</i>

05:34.779 --> 05:36.713
This is what we have on Mara Tran.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.714
A hair was removed
from the crime scene.

05:38.751 --> 05:40.865
It was not Luna's,
but it was a match for Mara.

05:40.902 --> 05:43.653
Match for colour, but without
consent, we can't know for sure.

05:43.754 --> 05:46.245
Well, Shane saw a woman
leaving the motel.

05:46.282 --> 05:47.849
He could ID Mara from a photo.

05:47.886 --> 05:49.491
That's not possible right now.

05:49.689 --> 05:52.095
The woman had a towel;

05:52.132 --> 05:53.851
maybe she cut herself
on the broken bottle,

05:53.888 --> 05:55.448
which would explain the
blood in the bathroom.

05:55.484 --> 05:56.602
An account based solely

05:56.639 --> 05:59.369
on the least reliable witness we have.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.658
OK.

06:03.086 --> 06:05.587
Bartender at the Lord Admiral
saw a woman

06:05.624 --> 06:07.547
with an American ID watching his room.

06:07.675 --> 06:09.642
Mara has a California driver's license.

06:09.679 --> 06:11.166
There's no way to prove that person

06:11.203 --> 06:12.758
was watching your father's room.

06:12.877 --> 06:15.352
And how many people have a
California license? 25 million?

06:15.427 --> 06:18.118
- In Millwood?
- Lots of tourists come here to fish.

06:18.235 --> 06:21.437
- Female millennial fishermen?
- It's not proof.

06:22.778 --> 06:25.513
I'm not saying this to make you mad.

06:26.091 --> 06:28.159
Evidence needs a contrarian.

06:29.899 --> 06:31.484
OK.

06:32.048 --> 06:34.743
She discovered that my father's firm

06:34.780 --> 06:36.648
had a client with a
contract with Lovand,

06:36.685 --> 06:38.876
the company threatening her
boyfriend and their movement.

06:38.913 --> 06:40.281
We don't have proof,

06:40.340 --> 06:42.265
irrefutable proof. Joanna...

06:42.302 --> 06:44.038
She probably came to Millwood

06:44.075 --> 06:46.919
to hack into his computer,
and he discovered her.

06:49.387 --> 06:51.034
That means he died because of me.

06:51.071 --> 06:53.890
Even if that is what happened,
it's not your fault.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.241
We need to call the judge,

06:57.278 --> 06:59.106
tell him what we know and
demand a postponement.

06:59.143 --> 07:01.992
We risk making things worse for Luna.

07:02.275 --> 07:04.534
The trial is starting tomorrow.

07:08.085 --> 07:11.267
Never had someone's
freedom in my hands.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.458
She wouldn't want it in anyone else's.

07:15.191 --> 07:17.125
We don't have to prove she's innocent.

07:17.551 --> 07:18.900
It's just about reasonable doubt.

07:18.937 --> 07:21.682
Keep poking holes.
Chip away at their witnesses.

07:22.321 --> 07:23.955
Hey...

07:24.422 --> 07:26.122
we got this.

07:33.958 --> 07:35.008
<i>The eyewitness</i>

07:35.044 --> 07:36.732
gave a physical description of a person

07:36.769 --> 07:39.068
leaving the motel around
the time of the murder.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.262
That description matched the accused.

07:41.351 --> 07:43.722
- It was nighttime? Dark?
- Yes.

07:43.759 --> 07:46.494
The person was seen leaving,
maybe in a hurry?

07:46.603 --> 07:48.244
- Maybe.
- I can't think

07:48.345 --> 07:50.713
of worse conditions
for an accurate description.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.054
- Objection.
- Careful, Ms. Chang.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.962
<i>We found the deceased on the bed.</i>

07:56.027 --> 07:58.378
We bagged his hands
according to our procedure.

07:58.441 --> 08:00.187
How many murders in Millwood

08:00.224 --> 08:01.777
since you joined the police service?

08:01.814 --> 08:05.349
- One.
- So this was your first homicide?

08:05.386 --> 08:06.966
Handling evidence, maintaining

08:07.003 --> 08:08.512
the integrity of the scene

08:08.549 --> 08:10.641
was your first time doing all of it.

08:10.734 --> 08:12.953
It'd be safe to say
that most of the officers,

08:12.990 --> 08:14.488
including you,

08:14.654 --> 08:16.417
were not competent to do the job.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.713
Your Honour, really?

08:17.750 --> 08:19.484
Ms. Chang...

08:23.057 --> 08:24.628
<i>The substance removed from under</i>

08:24.665 --> 08:26.763
the fingernails of the victim
was human skin,

08:26.800 --> 08:30.015
likely due to an altercation
with his attacker.

08:30.073 --> 08:32.738
We tested the DNA,
it was a match to the accused.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.933
Objection.
Chief is not an expert in DNA.

08:34.971 --> 08:37.717
- He can read a report.
- Overruled. Go ahead.

08:37.755 --> 08:39.515
When we brought
the accused into custody,

08:39.551 --> 08:40.866
she had scratch marks on her arms.

08:40.931 --> 08:42.599
But at first, you brought

08:42.700 --> 08:44.968
- her mother into custody.
- That is correct.

08:47.071 --> 08:49.405
The accused's mother, Gerrilynn Spence,

08:49.507 --> 08:52.373
had been involved in an
altercation with the deceased.

08:52.413 --> 08:54.511
- But then she was released?
- We were able to confirm

08:54.548 --> 08:56.682
- her alibi.
- So what made your focus

08:56.719 --> 08:58.520
- change to her daughter?
- Simple,

08:58.557 --> 09:00.456
she returned to Millwood that day

09:00.519 --> 09:03.812
and also confronted... the deceased.

09:04.404 --> 09:05.920
In his motel room,

09:05.957 --> 09:08.859
- same place as the murder.
- And upon questioning,

09:08.906 --> 09:11.827
did the accused deny
being in the motel room?

09:11.953 --> 09:13.496
She admitted she went into the room

09:13.533 --> 09:16.992
- at or around the time of death.
- So, opportunity

09:17.089 --> 09:19.871
and motive. What did you discover

09:19.942 --> 09:23.101
about the relationship between
the accused and the deceased?

09:23.138 --> 09:25.540
She claimed to be his biological child.

09:25.577 --> 09:27.953
Chief, when you took
the accused into custody,

09:27.990 --> 09:30.558
- were there other suspects?
- Sure.

09:30.679 --> 09:32.647
- Some.
- Mhm.

09:35.072 --> 09:37.520
Police are always
accused of tunnel vision,

09:37.621 --> 09:40.900
but when you have the right
person, when the evidence

09:40.937 --> 09:43.072
leads to a suspect so obvious,

09:43.494 --> 09:45.043
who has motive,

09:45.186 --> 09:47.340
opportunity, who hated him,

09:47.377 --> 09:48.454
who was in his room,

09:48.491 --> 09:51.295
her DNA under his fingernails...

09:52.002 --> 09:54.531
there's no reason to look any further.

09:55.306 --> 09:57.177
Thank you, Chief.

10:04.444 --> 10:06.511
It wasn't a total disaster.

10:06.691 --> 10:09.346
He laid out the entire case.

10:10.061 --> 10:12.575
DNA in the room, scorned daughter.

10:12.659 --> 10:15.224
That doesn't mean
the jury will believe Mercer.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.553
They're all Mercers.

10:21.015 --> 10:23.884
Billy, Joanna.

10:24.168 --> 10:25.831
Look, I know it's late.

10:25.966 --> 10:29.290
- I'm sorry for today.
- You didn't have a choice.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.774
There's someone you need to talk to.

10:41.335 --> 10:43.390
Let her go! She's innocent!

10:43.427 --> 10:44.631
<i>Chief Mercer,</i>

10:44.668 --> 10:47.536
you questioned a lot of people,
a lot of people with the motive

10:47.637 --> 10:49.961
to commit the crime,
but you only brought

10:49.998 --> 10:53.809
two people into custody.
Two Indigenous women.

10:53.910 --> 10:55.688
Just following evidence.

10:55.801 --> 10:58.156
- We had an eyewitness.
- Yes.

10:58.255 --> 10:59.834
The eyewitness said they saw

10:59.871 --> 11:02.092
an Indigenous woman leaving the motel.

11:02.275 --> 11:03.971
Chief Mercer,

11:04.106 --> 11:06.487
would you consider yourself
to be a racist?

11:06.611 --> 11:08.154
Objection. Chief Mercer

11:08.191 --> 11:10.325
is a decorated member
of the Millwood Police service.

11:10.519 --> 11:11.900
It's an important question.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.670
Lots of people in Millwood had a motive

11:13.707 --> 11:14.789
to kill David Hanley.

11:14.826 --> 11:16.932
It was Chief Mercer's job
to decide who to pursue.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.231
The witness will answer the question.

11:20.670 --> 11:22.471
Chief Mercer,

11:23.019 --> 11:24.406
are you a racist?

11:24.820 --> 11:26.120
No, Ma'am.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.479
- Are you sure? Just a little bit?
- Haha!

11:28.977 --> 11:30.326
I got a great relationship

11:30.363 --> 11:32.421
with all the people in
town, it's part of my job.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.832
So you wouldn't treat anybody
differently based on their race?

11:34.869 --> 11:37.308
- No. Everyone's equal.
- Whether somebody was white

11:37.345 --> 11:39.417
or if they're Indigenous?

11:39.517 --> 11:41.439
I think I made myself clear.

11:45.128 --> 11:48.237
Just last week, you picked up
a Millwood resident,

11:48.274 --> 11:49.431
Paul Ritchie,

11:49.468 --> 11:51.369
outside The Boot Saturday night.
You drove him home.

11:51.430 --> 11:53.365
- You remember?
- Sure. Yeah, I do that

11:53.402 --> 11:56.733
- if someone's had too many.
- And he is white, Paul Ritchie?

11:56.894 --> 11:59.708
- Yes, Paul Ritchie is white.
- White Paul Ritchie

11:59.745 --> 12:01.680
got home safely.

12:01.845 --> 12:03.746
What about Neil Bellegarde?

12:08.603 --> 12:12.006
A father, Millwood citizen, Indigenous.

12:12.203 --> 12:14.004
He went missing from his neighbourhood

12:14.151 --> 12:16.152
two and a half years ago.

12:21.837 --> 12:24.542
His body was found 10km away,

12:25.102 --> 12:28.070
past the edge of town. It was January,

12:29.233 --> 12:30.439
minus 30.

12:30.855 --> 12:33.008
He was wearing a t-shirt, no shoes.

12:34.355 --> 12:37.422
Paul Ritchie gets chauffeured home...

12:37.881 --> 12:40.315
Neil Bellegarde gets a Starlight Tour.

12:41.388 --> 12:42.628
That's what they call it, right?

12:42.665 --> 12:44.346
The Starlight Tour?

12:45.054 --> 12:47.654
Dumped on the edge of town.

12:48.099 --> 12:51.784
10km in Millwood in January
is a death sentence.

12:51.821 --> 12:53.529
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.182
He was in your patrol car that night.

12:55.219 --> 12:57.199
Objection. How about some evidence?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.101
Ms. Chang...

13:00.299 --> 13:02.371
An information request
for outstanding warrants

13:02.408 --> 13:04.630
for Neil Bellegarde came in
just after midnight

13:04.701 --> 13:06.060
from your patrol car.

13:06.097 --> 13:08.889
So why would you care
about Neil Bellegarde

13:08.926 --> 13:11.861
if he wasn't sitting
in the back of your car?

13:14.346 --> 13:16.038
I refuse to answer your questions

13:16.075 --> 13:18.153
until I consult with counsel.

13:19.278 --> 13:20.781
OK.

13:20.818 --> 13:22.760
I will go back to the
original question.

13:24.322 --> 13:27.745
Chief Mercer, are you a racist?

13:28.418 --> 13:30.485
No, Ma'am.

13:33.299 --> 13:35.191
The eyewitness said they saw

13:35.228 --> 13:37.844
an Indigenous woman leaving the motel.

13:38.090 --> 13:39.741
Not coming out of the victim's room,

13:39.778 --> 13:42.679
not standing over his body.
You made that assumption.

13:44.213 --> 13:46.715
That racist assumption.

13:52.604 --> 13:54.939
Court is in recess.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.128
<i>I didn't have an easy time
when I was your age.</i>

13:58.604 --> 14:01.363
When they called me
names at school, I, uh...

14:01.577 --> 14:03.665
I always punched first.

14:04.115 --> 14:06.717
Teenage Owen was headed
straight in their system.

14:08.631 --> 14:10.632
Then an elder gave me this.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.712
To guide me,

14:16.749 --> 14:19.150
to remind me that I was
part of something.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.818
We need to look out for one another.

14:28.358 --> 14:30.525
Thanks, Officer.

14:32.919 --> 14:35.046
OK, I can't do this. I can't do this.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.077
It's too late to back out now.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.956
Luna didn't do anything.

14:38.993 --> 14:41.264
You made a deal
with the police, Taylor.

14:41.319 --> 14:44.039
Just tell them the truth.

14:46.618 --> 14:49.439
You're a good person, Taylor,
everybody knows that.

14:49.535 --> 14:51.413
Then why am I doing this to her?

14:51.514 --> 14:53.247
If Luna said those things,

14:53.284 --> 14:55.227
you have an obligation
to tell the court.

14:55.292 --> 14:57.899
Yeah, but it doesn't
mean that she meant it.

14:58.121 --> 15:00.689
And it certainly doesn't mean
that she killed him!

15:00.750 --> 15:03.055
No, but that's up to a jury to decide.

15:03.095 --> 15:05.360
I just don't want
my words to get twisted.

15:05.409 --> 15:08.111
If you don't testify
and tell what you know,

15:08.148 --> 15:10.049
you will be sitting beside her

15:10.086 --> 15:11.653
in jail.

15:12.938 --> 15:15.832
On the 5th of June,
you traveled to Millwood

15:15.869 --> 15:17.935
- with the accused?
- Yes.

15:17.972 --> 15:22.344
And when you were driving,
did you talk about David Hanley?

15:26.519 --> 15:28.453
Uh, maybe.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.397
Ms. Matheson?

15:33.125 --> 15:35.146
I can't remember.

15:36.006 --> 15:39.481
You told investigators
that you discussed David Hanley,

15:39.545 --> 15:43.866
that the accused made statements
about killing him.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.311
I don't know.

15:47.267 --> 15:49.143
Last year, I was diagnosed

15:49.180 --> 15:52.393
with a brain injury from exposure

15:52.430 --> 15:54.828
to the chemical benzene.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.314
It has affected my memory. Sorry.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.004
You made a timely recording of your

16:01.041 --> 16:02.726
statements to insure their accuracy.

16:02.763 --> 16:05.309
You told police that your journal

16:05.388 --> 16:07.248
- reflects the truth.
- I'm not certain

16:07.285 --> 16:10.274
that I was in a position
to know what is true

16:10.321 --> 16:12.157
or what's accurate.

16:12.962 --> 16:16.799
Ms. Matheson, you are
directly contradicting

16:16.903 --> 16:19.201
your sworn statement.

16:19.873 --> 16:22.567
- That's perjury.
- As I mentioned,

16:22.614 --> 16:24.339
due to my condition,

16:24.440 --> 16:26.636
I don't recall my sworn statement.

16:26.779 --> 16:30.023
You received immunity
from prosecution in exchange

16:30.060 --> 16:31.713
for your testimony.

16:32.277 --> 16:33.922
That offer can be rescinded.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.164
The witness made a good faith

16:36.201 --> 16:38.212
agreement with police
in exchange for her testimony.

16:38.249 --> 16:42.207
Now the crown claims perjury,
but perjury requires intent.

16:42.739 --> 16:44.797
Due to the severity
of her brain impairment

16:44.834 --> 16:47.975
the witness is incapable
of forming the requisite intent

16:48.012 --> 16:49.946
for the commission
of the crime of perjury.

16:50.302 --> 16:53.243
Her testimony is
necessary to establish premeditation.

16:53.314 --> 16:55.209
I'm not impressed by your tactics,

16:55.311 --> 16:57.596
Mr. Bennett, or
by your choice of witness.

16:57.665 --> 17:01.227
How can she be expected
to provide reliable testimony?

17:02.401 --> 17:05.809
The jury will disregard
this witness' testimony.

17:06.281 --> 17:08.478
Ms. Matheson, you're dismissed.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.925
With Taylor's testimony thrown out,

17:16.962 --> 17:19.630
it's very unlikely
they can prove premeditation.

17:19.698 --> 17:23.166
- S0 no first-degree murder then?
- Which would be huge for us.

17:23.963 --> 17:26.260
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

17:26.577 --> 17:29.310
Your Honour, we'd like to add
a name to our witness list.

17:29.364 --> 17:32.528
- We call Joanna Chang to the stand.
- Objection, Your Honour.

17:32.565 --> 17:35.100
- She's the lawyer of record.
- Our investigation has

17:35.137 --> 17:38.248
uncovered material evidence that
Ms. Chang failed to disclose.

17:44.359 --> 17:46.845
<i>Joanna, you need to call me back.</i>

17:47.469 --> 17:51.536
<i>I don't get it. My mom's birth
certificate says she was underage,</i>

17:51.573 --> 17:55.442
<i>and guys like David
get off with nothing.</i>

17:55.631 --> 17:58.066
<i>But not this time. I don't know how,</i>

17:58.103 --> 18:00.011
<i>but he's gonna pay for what he did.</i>

18:00.292 --> 18:02.627
<i>He's gonna get what's coming to him.</i>

18:08.192 --> 18:10.737
That voice-mail was left on your phone

18:10.774 --> 18:12.349
one week before your
father was murdered.

18:12.386 --> 18:14.799
Your Honour, we strongly object
to the use of this evidence

18:14.836 --> 18:16.904
in violation of the witness'
right to privacy.

18:16.979 --> 18:19.541
Voice-mail was obtained
legally under a search warrant

18:19.578 --> 18:21.970
and comes from the
accused's outgoing calls.

18:22.007 --> 18:23.634
The privacy right belongs

18:23.671 --> 18:25.322
to the witness, it was her phone.

18:25.359 --> 18:26.994
Voice-mails are stored
in a central server,

18:27.031 --> 18:29.466
there's no inherent right to privacy.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.415
- Alright, go ahead, Mr. Bennett.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

18:32.865 --> 18:36.100
Ms. Chang, what did it mean
that "guys like"

18:36.137 --> 18:39.562
David Hanley get off with nothing"?

18:40.475 --> 18:41.799
My father was accused

18:41.836 --> 18:44.104
of engaging in sexual
activity with a minor.

18:44.141 --> 18:48.015
With the accused's mother,
Gerrilynn Spence.

18:48.308 --> 18:49.834
Luna believed that she was the product

18:49.871 --> 18:51.472
of that alleged crime.

18:51.754 --> 18:54.523
The charges were dropped.
Did that make Luna mad?

18:54.824 --> 18:56.420
She sounds really mad.

18:56.457 --> 18:58.636
- Objection! Speculation.
- Sustained.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.717
You listened to that message
over a dozen times.

19:00.828 --> 19:02.584
And then after your father was killed,

19:02.638 --> 19:05.097
an hour after Luna Spence
was taken into custody,

19:05.134 --> 19:07.035
you listened to the message once again.

19:07.352 --> 19:08.828
And then you deleted it.

19:08.907 --> 19:11.927
You must have known
that was relevant evidence.

19:12.221 --> 19:13.905
And destroying evidence
in a criminal case

19:13.942 --> 19:15.627
constitutes obstruction of justice,

19:15.664 --> 19:17.372
an indictable offense

19:17.469 --> 19:19.325
carrying a jail time of up to 10 years.

19:19.362 --> 19:21.028
I'm sorry, does he have a question?

19:21.065 --> 19:23.985
Why did you listen to the
message after she was arrested?

19:27.285 --> 19:29.090
I wanted to make sure.

19:29.486 --> 19:32.331
- Of?
- When I heard the message,

19:32.474 --> 19:33.926
I...

19:34.054 --> 19:36.212
I didn't think
that he was in any danger.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.037
Luna was mad at him,

19:40.176 --> 19:42.010
a lot of people were,

19:42.134 --> 19:45.766
but she's not capable
of harming anyone.

19:45.909 --> 19:47.975
If I thought that he was in danger,

19:48.012 --> 19:49.913
I would have...
I would have warned him.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.126
I would have stopped it!

19:53.075 --> 19:54.549
I didn't want him to die.

19:55.577 --> 19:57.498
If it wasn't evidence of guilt,

19:57.535 --> 19:59.757
why would you delete the message?

20:03.610 --> 20:05.468
I don't know what happened
to the message.

20:05.523 --> 20:09.829
Well, according to our expert,
that message was deleted

20:09.924 --> 20:13.042
immediately after it was
listened to on that morning,

20:13.079 --> 20:15.513
at 9:26 A.M.

20:15.550 --> 20:18.740
On another case, I have been
consistently the target of phone

20:18.777 --> 20:20.533
and computer hacking.

20:20.645 --> 20:22.406
My car was hacked.

20:22.473 --> 20:25.110
My office was bugged.
Nothing that's happened

20:25.147 --> 20:28.082
on my phone or any of my other
devices can be trusted.

20:28.246 --> 20:30.574
It's a wild conspiracy.

20:31.581 --> 20:34.611
Well... are you saying,

20:34.674 --> 20:36.291
under threat of perjury,

20:36.392 --> 20:38.627
that you did not
delete that voice-mail?

20:38.989 --> 20:40.601
It wasn't a threat.

20:40.695 --> 20:43.872
- Luna was never a threat.
- Answer the question.

20:44.874 --> 20:47.232
I didn't delete it.

20:49.396 --> 20:51.531
Thank you, Your Honour.

20:57.777 --> 21:00.315
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

21:00.416 --> 21:03.133
We call in an expert. We bring in Mara.

21:03.419 --> 21:05.979
- To corroborate your story?
- We serve a notice to appear.

21:06.142 --> 21:09.211
- We get Mara on the stand.
- With what evidence?

21:09.392 --> 21:12.594
My car was hacked into.
So was my phone.

21:12.810 --> 21:14.696
They recorded my conversations.

21:14.987 --> 21:16.898
I was there.

21:17.196 --> 21:18.933
We deleted it.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.169
"We" didn't delete it, Billy.

21:21.746 --> 21:23.680
I didn't stop you.

21:24.664 --> 21:26.571
We need to bring in Mara.

21:26.864 --> 21:29.998
We have to or we will lose.

21:31.670 --> 21:34.046
<i>Why did you suspect
Mara in the first place?</i>

21:34.122 --> 21:36.751
According to Noah, the last
thing that was looked at

21:36.788 --> 21:38.620
on my father's computer was a contract

21:38.657 --> 21:40.412
between his client

21:40.449 --> 21:42.216
and Lovand.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.288
It doesn't make sense.

21:44.342 --> 21:46.844
He's a senior partner...
it was a license agreement.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.815
So not something
he's gonna waste his time on.

21:48.852 --> 21:51.034
He's got a dozen lawyers
working on those kinds

21:51.071 --> 21:53.223
of details, and all of a sudden,
he's poring over it

21:53.260 --> 21:54.963
in a Millwood motel room?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.069
It was not him.

21:56.129 --> 21:57.447
You think it was Mara?

21:57.484 --> 21:59.526
Lovand was ruining their lives.

21:59.563 --> 22:01.816
And mine. And it was the exact document

22:01.853 --> 22:03.238
that she asked me to get from him.

22:03.282 --> 22:05.180
She had the time to drive to Millwood.

22:05.217 --> 22:07.785
She had the skill to hack
into his computer.

22:08.169 --> 22:09.751
And he caught her.

22:10.933 --> 22:12.637
Any chance you could get to Noah?

22:12.674 --> 22:14.022
If he has email it's probably

22:14.059 --> 22:17.595
on his own server and all of his
social-media feeds are shut down.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.530
And he just bolted for the airport.

22:19.567 --> 22:21.501
Something spooked him.

22:24.727 --> 22:26.695
The security system.

22:27.470 --> 22:28.928
My father's laptop,

22:29.008 --> 22:30.676
Noah was breaking into it for me.

22:30.897 --> 22:33.761
He said there was an
advanced security system,

22:33.798 --> 22:37.518
that took a photo of anybody
attempting an unauthorized entry.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.514
He was retrieving that when he ran.

22:39.615 --> 22:41.516
Mara.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.886
There's a picture of her
at the crime scene.

22:45.272 --> 22:47.353
- We have to get that picture.
- But she has the laptop,

22:47.390 --> 22:48.794
she would have destroyed it.

22:48.831 --> 22:50.389
No, if it's an advanced
security system,

22:50.426 --> 22:52.062
it won't just be on the laptop.

22:52.195 --> 22:53.396
Any picture that camera took

22:53.433 --> 22:54.713
will be stored on the cloud somewhere.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.015
We need a hacker

22:56.098 --> 22:57.986
who's willing to break a few laws.

23:05.701 --> 23:07.635
Is it that bad?

23:07.736 --> 23:10.004
And I don't even get a say.
I don't get to stand up

23:10.105 --> 23:12.773
in front of the jury
and tell them I'm innocent.

23:14.079 --> 23:15.995
I sit there,

23:16.178 --> 23:17.890
and people tell lies about me.

23:26.123 --> 23:28.756
I loved looking at the sky
when I was a kid.

23:29.331 --> 23:31.151
Prairie sky goes on forever.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.848
It's freedom.

23:33.990 --> 23:37.159
And they only give us
a tiny piece of it.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.773
Just enough to see what we don't have.

23:42.001 --> 23:44.035
I'm sick of having no power.

23:46.243 --> 23:48.340
What would you do if you could get out?

23:48.456 --> 23:51.182
I have to think about
what I'd do if I don't.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.400
Sunil.

24:04.793 --> 24:08.766
- Joanna, I'm really sorry.
- I don't have time.

24:08.957 --> 24:11.282
You spied on me. You bugged our office.

24:11.581 --> 24:13.065
I need a hacker.

24:13.102 --> 24:14.417
I know that you know people,

24:14.454 --> 24:17.068
and you're clearly willing to
cross the line to get a result.

24:17.105 --> 24:19.849
Lovand had something on me.

24:20.332 --> 24:22.567
They offered me a deal.

24:23.183 --> 24:25.117
I didn't have a choice.

24:25.544 --> 24:27.078
I need someone to crack into

24:27.115 --> 24:29.461
an advanced security system today, like

24:29.550 --> 24:30.945
right now.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.286
Everything you need to know is in here.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.626
Look, I'm already in a lot of trouble.

24:36.237 --> 24:38.446
I'm facing a disbarment hearing.

24:40.629 --> 24:43.729
Steadman Lavery is
sending me to Singapore.

24:46.201 --> 24:48.102
I may not be available

24:48.203 --> 24:50.938
to testify at your disbarment hearing.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.524
Maybe you get to keep your license.

25:00.827 --> 25:02.762
The clock's running.

25:06.856 --> 25:09.112
<i>- State your name.</i>
- Mara Tran.

25:10.134 --> 25:13.527
I have a Master's in Computer
Science from Stanford.

25:13.629 --> 25:16.594
I have worked at several notable
Silicon Valley companies,

25:16.631 --> 25:19.785
and I am the chief technology
officer of GenBreach.

25:19.859 --> 25:21.772
How easy is it to
hack in someone's phone?

25:21.809 --> 25:22.903
It's simple.

25:22.954 --> 25:24.950
Most people think their phones
are private and secure

25:24.987 --> 25:26.910
because they're
in their physical possession,

25:26.947 --> 25:30.484
most of the apps you download open
up a backdoor for people like me.

25:30.521 --> 25:32.422
So, would it be safe to say
that just because something

25:32.466 --> 25:35.080
happens on someone's phone...
like a message gets deleted...

25:35.117 --> 25:37.752
that you can't assume
that the phone's owner did it?

25:38.034 --> 25:40.139
It would be easy to hack
into someone's phone and make it

25:40.176 --> 25:42.490
look like the owner
did or said anything.

25:42.569 --> 25:44.588
It's indistinguishable.

25:44.929 --> 25:48.140
- Thank you. That's all.
- Thank you, Ms. Tran.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.917
Uh, wait!

25:50.084 --> 25:52.533
Are there advanced security systems

25:52.612 --> 25:56.022
that capture evidence of hacking?

25:56.059 --> 25:57.676
Yes. Some hackers end up

25:57.713 --> 26:00.320
leaving digital footprints
if they're not careful.

26:00.391 --> 26:03.723
The deceased in this
trial was also hacked.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.836
His laptop had an
advanced security system.

26:05.873 --> 26:07.584
It took a photo of the hacker.

26:07.821 --> 26:09.712
Did you know the deceased,
David Hanley?

26:09.807 --> 26:11.318
No.

26:11.420 --> 26:13.717
The Privacy Project that you worked on,

26:13.795 --> 26:16.697
it was being harassed
by a major defense contractor.

26:16.845 --> 26:18.184
Where is this going?

26:18.221 --> 26:19.415
This will only take a few minutes.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.758
It'll be worth it hopefully.

26:20.795 --> 26:22.994
Quickly. The witness is here

26:23.031 --> 26:25.833
as a technology expert only.

26:27.065 --> 26:30.116
The Project was being sued
by Lovand Industries

26:30.153 --> 26:31.812
who claimed that your boyfriend,

26:31.849 --> 26:33.756
Noah Achari, was sabotaging

26:33.793 --> 26:36.046
their product
and destroying their business.

26:37.112 --> 26:39.600
They were trying
to get revenge on Noah.

26:40.013 --> 26:42.614
- You were very protective of him?
- Of him.

26:42.651 --> 26:44.552
Of the movement. Sure.

26:44.653 --> 26:47.555
Was my father in possession
of documents that you needed

26:47.745 --> 26:50.360
to help Noah, to help the movement?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.551
Yes.

26:51.588 --> 26:54.275
You were desperate to
get your hands on them.

26:54.607 --> 26:56.875
You asked me to get them,
and I refused?

26:59.985 --> 27:01.847
You need to answer.

27:02.541 --> 27:06.006
Did you ask me to get
the papers from my father?

27:07.074 --> 27:08.709
- Yes.
- And did I refuse?

27:08.746 --> 27:11.114
- Yes.
- And you were mad.

27:12.102 --> 27:14.048
You were trying to keep Noah alive.

27:14.811 --> 27:16.684
Yes. Maybe.

27:16.721 --> 27:18.598
And after I refused,

27:18.635 --> 27:21.455
my father's computer was hacked.

27:21.492 --> 27:23.032
The same night that he died.

27:23.407 --> 27:24.792
I don't know anything about that.

27:25.092 --> 27:26.961
Have you been to Millwood before today?

27:26.998 --> 27:28.089
No.

27:28.126 --> 27:30.529
A long, dark hair was found
next to my father's body.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.394
Objection. There's no hair
sample in the evidence log.

27:33.458 --> 27:37.327
That hair mysteriously
disappeared from police files.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.306
- Your Honour, please.
- Ms. Chang!

27:39.407 --> 27:40.708
Withdrawn.

27:41.767 --> 27:43.991
May I be excused? I don't feel so well.

27:44.084 --> 27:46.480
The bottle broke. You cut your hand.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.938
You tried to clean it up, but you left

27:47.975 --> 27:50.678
one little drop of blood
in the bathroom.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.939
This didn't disappear.

27:57.608 --> 27:59.725
Someone was watching my father's room

27:59.762 --> 28:01.256
from the bar across the street,

28:01.310 --> 28:02.415
waiting for him to leave.

28:02.452 --> 28:04.576
Someone with an American
driver's license.

28:04.633 --> 28:07.202
Will you show the court
your driver's license?

28:08.316 --> 28:09.371
No?

28:09.408 --> 28:11.969
You went to Millwood that night.

28:12.305 --> 28:15.564
To protect Noah.
To protect the movement.

28:15.994 --> 28:18.151
You snuck into his room after he left

28:18.188 --> 28:20.033
and he caught you.

28:20.874 --> 28:22.842
You were scared. You defended yourself.

28:23.133 --> 28:24.834
No.

28:25.093 --> 28:26.646
And you killed him.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.355
I didn't.

28:28.664 --> 28:31.351
But not before you got
caught on camera.

28:39.143 --> 28:40.660
It was an accident.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.629
Oh, my God!

28:44.046 --> 28:47.300
Order! Order!

28:52.045 --> 28:54.775
- Our client is innocent...
- I said, "No surprises," Ms. Chang.

28:54.812 --> 28:56.501
Would you like to explain yourself?

28:56.629 --> 28:59.145
We have a witness
at the Lord Admiral Tavern

28:59.182 --> 29:01.644
who will place Mara Tran in
Millwood the night of the murder,

29:01.681 --> 29:04.283
and DNA will place her
in my father's motel room.

29:04.385 --> 29:05.928
Ms. Chang, in my court,

29:05.965 --> 29:08.757
we follow the rules of
procedure and evidence.

29:08.890 --> 29:11.432
- I don't know what that was in there...
- Your Honour,

29:11.705 --> 29:13.255
that was reasonable doubt.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.262
Luna Spence...

29:28.680 --> 29:30.480
...you have been charged
with the murder

29:30.517 --> 29:32.785
of David Richard Hanley.

29:36.350 --> 29:39.293
Your Honour, the Crown is...

29:42.934 --> 29:45.191
...withdrawing the charge.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.827
Ms. Spence,

29:48.188 --> 29:49.662
you are free to go.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.454
Don't hold on to this.

30:38.542 --> 30:40.581
How do I just move on with my life?

30:40.685 --> 30:43.478
I know something about
not being able to move on.

30:43.823 --> 30:45.758
You just keep trying.

30:50.734 --> 30:53.662
I saw a side of Millwood I didn't like,

30:54.121 --> 30:56.956
and I moved here
when he bought us the house, and...

30:57.494 --> 30:59.146
I thought I had to live in exile

30:59.183 --> 31:01.130
because of something he did to me.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.281
You're going back to Long Grass?

31:07.400 --> 31:10.052
- Mom, you're going home?
- Yeah.

31:11.633 --> 31:14.800
We don't have to answer
to David Hanley anymore.

31:18.695 --> 31:20.696
There's no way I can go back to work.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.998
Mercer can't stay chief,
not after that.

31:23.043 --> 31:26.498
Oh, this is Millwood,
nothing would surprise me.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.122
I know what you risked for me.

31:39.308 --> 31:40.792
I can't ever thank you enough.

31:40.856 --> 31:43.052
No, you just do what you do.

31:43.153 --> 31:45.054
You're gonna make the world great.

31:45.155 --> 31:47.607
You're better than you think
you are too, you know?

31:51.399 --> 31:54.016
- Where's Billy?
- He got a call, he had to go.

31:54.215 --> 31:57.266
Mm-hmm. Isn't that your move?

32:00.404 --> 32:02.345
- OK.
- Come on.

32:03.070 --> 32:04.993
I'm sorry I had
to pull you away from court.

32:05.292 --> 32:08.561
- I'm glad you called.
- He was asking for you.

32:10.781 --> 32:13.241
Shane, I'm sorry
about how I got you in here.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.519
I didn't have a choice.

32:17.225 --> 32:18.950
You were worried.

32:19.556 --> 32:20.933
You don't have to be.

32:21.051 --> 32:23.286
Everything's gonna be OK.

32:24.077 --> 32:27.079
We're Crawfords,
nothing we can't handle.

32:27.351 --> 32:29.015
You were hearing voices.

32:29.129 --> 32:31.560
I don't hear voices, Billy.

32:32.238 --> 32:35.187
I can read minds, OK?

32:38.886 --> 32:40.273
And I am just starting

32:40.310 --> 32:42.278
to harness my powers.

32:44.086 --> 32:46.158
Dad always said I was different.

32:46.319 --> 32:47.978
If I concentrate,

32:48.107 --> 32:50.175
I can control people.

32:51.049 --> 32:52.688
I can implant thoughts in their heads.

32:52.725 --> 32:54.273
Shane...

32:54.723 --> 32:56.590
promise me you'll take the meds.

32:57.428 --> 32:59.404
Billy, my protector,

32:59.975 --> 33:03.966
the gallant knight
in sunshine and shadow,

33:04.721 --> 33:07.169
Over the mountains of the Moon,

33:07.863 --> 33:10.573
down the Valley of the Shadow,

33:10.936 --> 33:12.626
ride,

33:12.944 --> 33:15.604
boldly ride, Billy boy.

33:29.192 --> 33:31.160
Sorry. I had to run into the city.

33:31.665 --> 33:33.900
I didn't want to leave
without saying goodbye.

33:37.944 --> 33:39.449
So,

33:39.762 --> 33:42.490
you're off to conquer
the international legal world.

33:43.078 --> 33:44.740
Asia.

33:45.101 --> 33:46.709
I leave in two weeks.

33:48.241 --> 33:50.279
Wow, that's...

33:50.642 --> 33:52.643
It's amazing.

33:56.853 --> 33:59.363
Yeah, I'm thinking of leaving Millwood.

34:00.404 --> 34:03.907
Yeah. Yeah, it's time
to challenge myself,

34:04.461 --> 34:05.982
get better.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.148
I liked criminal law.

34:08.697 --> 34:10.599
More people, less paper.

34:10.781 --> 34:12.701
Paper is way better than people.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.737
We will agree to disagree.

34:14.810 --> 34:17.473
Not the first time.

34:20.088 --> 34:22.857
- Are you selling this place?
- Oh no.

34:23.092 --> 34:24.893
No, I'm keeping the place.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.801
I'll need to get out of the city
once in a while.

34:30.175 --> 34:32.576
Billy Crawford in the city...

34:37.822 --> 34:39.495
You'll be near Shane.

34:40.683 --> 34:43.159
I know how close
you two were growing up.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.208
I got him into a hospital.

34:46.447 --> 34:49.088
I had to trick him,
get him to attack me,

34:49.125 --> 34:51.715
but it was the only way
to get him the help he needed.

34:57.826 --> 34:59.460
I'm sorry.

35:00.441 --> 35:02.699
It's a broken system.

35:02.870 --> 35:04.904
Might need fixing.

35:08.592 --> 35:10.960
What are you gonna do about...?

35:11.434 --> 35:13.335
My dad?

35:15.231 --> 35:17.132
I don't know what to do with him.

35:18.637 --> 35:22.753
I think he'd be happiest
sprinkled under his desk at CTS.

35:23.974 --> 35:26.585
The cleaning staff would just
vacuum him up.

35:28.536 --> 35:30.379
Every place I think of

35:30.416 --> 35:32.384
would just annoy him.

35:32.644 --> 35:34.678
What would annoy him the most?

35:38.888 --> 35:40.963
He didn't really like
any of these people.

35:41.050 --> 35:43.418
He just didn't really know 'em.

35:44.091 --> 35:47.225
Now he'll get to spend
some quality time with them.

35:50.934 --> 35:53.245
You know this is technically illegal.

35:53.507 --> 35:55.104
Ah, it's not the most illegal thing

35:55.141 --> 35:57.108
we've ever done together.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.060
<i>No need to meet in dark
alleyways, Owen,</i>

37:01.106 --> 37:03.187
<i>- thanks to you.</i>
- And you.

37:03.633 --> 37:04.762
Thank you, Mayor.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.478
For what?

37:07.158 --> 37:09.185
- Caring.
- Ha!

37:09.539 --> 37:12.130
It's in the job description.

37:12.935 --> 37:15.175
Millwood needs a new chief of police,

37:15.443 --> 37:17.210
and I need someone I can trust.

37:20.478 --> 37:22.379
Are you offering me the job?

37:22.563 --> 37:24.718
We need a strong and measured hand

37:24.755 --> 37:27.920
on the rudder, Owen.
Especially after all this.

37:31.843 --> 37:33.179
I'm honoured.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.994
Does it mean you'll take it?

37:35.620 --> 37:37.263
Well, I'll have to think about it.

37:37.949 --> 37:39.531
Of course.

37:39.770 --> 37:41.501
Take all the time
you need before Monday.

37:45.506 --> 37:47.474
Uh, Mayor,

37:47.575 --> 37:49.609
what happens to Sam Mercer?

37:49.955 --> 37:51.956
It's up to the new Chief to decide.

38:01.182 --> 38:03.543
<i>Millbrew wasn't just a beer.</i>

38:03.580 --> 38:06.199
<i>It was an elixir</i> of life.

38:06.439 --> 38:08.561
The recipe was hidden
by the ancient Aztecs

38:08.598 --> 38:11.173
in the sun temple at Teotihuacan.

38:11.338 --> 38:14.812
They called it the Nectar of the Gods.

38:15.417 --> 38:18.438
We set out from Leon
Trotsky's house in Mexico City.

38:18.539 --> 38:20.558
Me, my father,

38:20.595 --> 38:23.464
two mules and a pair
of Rhodesian Ridgebacks.

38:23.711 --> 38:26.179
We stole their recipe.

38:26.515 --> 38:28.181
And when they come to claim it back,

38:28.282 --> 38:30.383
I need all of you to be ready.

38:32.025 --> 38:33.722
Welcome to the North End!

38:34.321 --> 38:36.774
- Have you come to say goodbye?
- I leave tonight.

38:36.901 --> 38:39.325
Just a short 31-hour flight
with 3 stops.

38:39.426 --> 38:41.258
- Haha!
- Um...

38:41.352 --> 38:43.754
I also came to, uh...

38:46.283 --> 38:47.873
I love you.

38:54.274 --> 38:56.142
I love you too.

38:57.824 --> 38:59.725
So, when do you head back to school?

39:00.279 --> 39:03.750
Um, I am actually not
going back to Montreal.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.685
I'm transferring back here,
and I'm gonna go to U of M.

39:06.836 --> 39:09.070
But this feels like home.

39:10.671 --> 39:12.639
You heard from Molly?

39:14.224 --> 39:16.196
I saw that she posted

39:16.297 --> 39:19.632
some pics on a white,
sandy beach somewhere.

39:23.969 --> 39:25.970
You miss her.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.377
We both had to grow,

39:29.581 --> 39:31.597
and we had to be apart to do that.

39:31.845 --> 39:33.847
Luna, you're so young,

39:34.249 --> 39:36.349
how do you know so much already?

39:37.455 --> 39:39.152
I don't know.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.920
My ancestors.

39:41.021 --> 39:42.783
A great mother.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.303
And my older sister's no dummy either.

39:48.084 --> 39:51.990
Seriously, the North End could
always use a great lawyer.

39:52.112 --> 39:55.443
Well, you better hurry
and get through law school.

42:17.577 --> 42:18.736
Hi.

42:18.813 --> 42:20.747
<i>There's something I never told you.</i>

42:21.396 --> 42:24.065
Something I never told anyone.

42:26.093 --> 42:27.960
I keep running

42:28.038 --> 42:29.678
<i>because...</i>

42:32.521 --> 42:36.242
...I don't think
I've ever been loved, so...

42:39.668 --> 42:41.955
...so I don't know how to love.

42:42.128 --> 42:44.137
That's not true.

42:45.541 --> 42:47.073
There are people who love you.

42:47.423 --> 42:49.208
They try,

42:49.437 --> 42:52.314
but I won't let them.

42:55.026 --> 42:57.417
Well, you're going to a whole new city.

42:58.272 --> 42:59.891
It's a fresh start.

43:00.210 --> 43:02.411
<i>You can be whoever you want to be.</i>

43:03.763 --> 43:05.998
Did you think about asking me...

43:07.923 --> 43:10.024
...to stay with you?

43:13.194 --> 43:15.295
You know, I, uh...

43:15.626 --> 43:17.727
I can't compete with Singapore.

43:19.267 --> 43:20.940
You're gonna conquer the world.

43:21.041 --> 43:23.064
<i>You didn't answer the question.</i>
