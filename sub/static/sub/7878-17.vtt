00:33.136 --> 00:36.772
(Francine humming)

00:37.232 --> 00:39.034
Franny, please
stop that humming

00:39.103 --> 00:41.754
or I'm gonna strangle you with
your own hair, baby, okay?

00:41.822 --> 00:42.839
I like the humming.

00:42.907 --> 00:44.641
It shows
her pleasant disposition.

00:44.708 --> 00:47.393
Francine's morning hums are
what help get me out of bed.

00:47.461 --> 00:48.761
Thank you,
sweetheart.

00:48.829 --> 00:50.763
Wanda Sykes is
coming to town.

00:50.831 --> 00:52.999
Good luck selling out
the Civic Auditorium.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.134
The Langley Falls Dynamite
can't even do that,

00:55.202 --> 00:57.070
and they're the best
all-male nude revue

00:57.137 --> 00:58.555
in the greater
Lanceton area.

00:58.622 --> 01:00.623
Yeah, but they lost
Chocolate Don.

01:00.691 --> 01:02.609
Oh, no, no, no, no,
Chocolate Don is back.

01:02.676 --> 01:04.244
Oh, really?
His mom is better?

01:04.311 --> 01:07.647
No, she passed.
So he's back but he's sad.

01:07.715 --> 01:10.867
And what do you have to say
for yourself, Metro section?

01:10.935 --> 01:13.202
Dad, can't you read the
newspaper without talking to it?

01:13.270 --> 01:14.954
It puts me off my meal.

01:15.022 --> 01:17.390
I like when your father
talks to the paper.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.859
Makes me feel like I work
at <i>Murphy Brown.</i>

You're bleeding!

01:30.004 --> 01:31.871
And it's not even
that time of the month.

01:31.939 --> 01:33.206
Period joke!

01:33.274 --> 01:35.959
(both guffawing)

01:36.010 --> 01:40.179
Hey, babe, we need to pick
a design for our new checks.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.664
I'm thinking hot rods.

01:41.732 --> 01:43.316
We're not putting hot
rods on our checks.

01:43.384 --> 01:45.001
This is the first thing
that both of our names

01:45.052 --> 01:46.552
are going to be on as
a married couple, okay?

01:46.637 --> 01:48.121
We should take
this seriously.

01:48.188 --> 01:52.558
Okay, if you don't want
hot rods, how about hot dogs?

01:52.626 --> 01:54.327
How about no.

01:54.395 --> 01:55.662
Not the food.

01:55.729 --> 01:58.498
I'm talking canines
in sexy poses.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.285
We'll go with
Nelson Mandela.

02:03.988 --> 02:05.738
I don't want a football player.

02:05.806 --> 02:06.973
He's not a...

02:07.041 --> 02:09.324
How could you not know
who Nelson Mandela is?

02:09.376 --> 02:10.842
Idiot.
Dummy.

02:10.911 --> 02:11.861
Jerk.
Whore.

02:11.912 --> 02:13.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.665
You newlyweds have been
fighting an awful lot lately.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.183
You two need
to model your marriage

02:17.251 --> 02:19.319
after a perfect one,
like...

02:19.386 --> 02:20.236
Ours.
Ours.

02:20.304 --> 02:21.270
You guys?!

02:21.338 --> 02:23.439
Your father and
I have 20 years

02:23.507 --> 02:25.241

perfect sync.

02:25.309 --> 02:27.744
We just... we

03:22.933 --> 03:25.818
It turned into all gibberish,
and I won't be a part of it.

03:25.886 --> 03:28.187
Anyway, point is:
we're strong.

03:28.255 --> 03:29.956
Where'd you get the food,
greaser dude?

03:30.024 --> 03:31.491
Greg and Terry's.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.526
They're having a big open house
to show off their new kitchen.

03:33.594 --> 03:34.527
New kitchen?

03:34.595 --> 03:36.396
Did they put in a new fridge?

03:36.463 --> 03:38.698
Mm-hmm.
And did they get a new stove?

03:38.766 --> 03:39.832
Yeah.

03:39.917 --> 03:41.084
Yeah, they did.

03:41.151 --> 03:43.419
And did they put in
all-new cabinets?

03:43.487 --> 03:45.154
I, uh, I think so.

03:45.222 --> 03:46.723
Cabi-nots-ah!

03:46.790 --> 03:49.842
All-new cabinets!

03:49.927 --> 03:50.860
Preach it, honey.

03:50.928 --> 03:51.828
Excus-a me?

03:51.895 --> 03:54.247
Oh, a little birdie just told me

03:54.314 --> 03:57.200
about all-new floors!

03:57.267 --> 03:58.384
Hallelujah!

03:58.452 --> 03:59.986
Praise the floors!

04:00.070 --> 04:03.406
(gibbering)

04:03.473 --> 04:04.824
Whoo, whoo!

04:04.908 --> 04:07.160
Okay, okay.

04:07.244 --> 04:08.644
Let's go see it!

04:08.695 --> 04:09.812
Yeah!

04:09.863 --> 04:13.015
(cheering)
Yeah! Let's go! Whoo!

04:13.083 --> 04:15.051
(playing Dixieland jazz)

04:17.788 --> 04:20.656
Okay, Megan Fox and Seth Rogen
come out of a room

04:20.707 --> 04:22.324
containing
only one chair.

04:22.376 --> 04:24.127
Do you sniff
the chair?

04:24.178 --> 04:28.548
Jamie Foxx is not
a Wayans brother.

04:28.632 --> 04:30.416
Think fast.
(laughs)

04:30.484 --> 04:33.419
64 blue, 19 red,
21 brown, 38 green.

04:33.487 --> 04:35.221
142 total candies.

04:35.289 --> 04:36.338
(cries)

04:37.491 --> 04:38.791
Hold up.

04:38.859 --> 04:43.029
It looks like we got
ourselves a magic moron.

04:43.097 --> 04:46.949
You boys ever played a little
game called blackjack?

04:47.017 --> 04:50.586
Principal Lewis, I think
our homeroom hamster is sick.

04:50.654 --> 04:51.520
Think fast.
(hamster squeals)

04:51.572 --> 04:52.505
(laughs)

04:52.573 --> 04:54.240
It never gets old.

04:55.592 --> 04:57.193
Okay, Rain Man,

04:57.261 --> 04:58.861
what cards are
left in the deck?

04:58.929 --> 05:01.164
Three jacks, a king,
two eights, and a four,

05:01.231 --> 05:02.615
definitely a four.

05:02.683 --> 05:04.600
Treat.

05:04.668 --> 05:06.335
Next stop,
the casino.

05:06.386 --> 05:08.604
When Barry signals
the deck is hot,

05:08.672 --> 05:10.540
you boys sit down
and bet strong.

05:10.607 --> 05:13.543
Snot, you're Jewish; you'll
be in charge of the money.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.795
Steve, you'll be in
charge of watching Snot

05:15.863 --> 05:17.430
because I don't
trust Jews.

05:17.498 --> 05:19.132
Come on, let's go
play some blackjack.

05:19.199 --> 05:21.400
Now?
But we have geometry class.

05:21.468 --> 05:22.668
I'll write
you a note.

05:23.854 --> 05:25.838
Dear Math Bitch,

05:25.906 --> 05:27.690
These kids ain't showing up.

05:27.758 --> 05:29.942
Love, your main man.

05:30.010 --> 05:34.330
P.S. One plus one
equals the two of us.

05:34.398 --> 05:37.233
Plus one more
would be nice, though.

05:37.301 --> 05:40.102
Maybe Jill from the cafeteria

05:40.170 --> 05:44.223
or your sister Lisa--
you know, when she's legal.

05:48.996 --> 05:51.764
Our cappuccino maker is now
built right into the fridge.

05:51.832 --> 05:53.266
Ooh, what's this for?

05:53.333 --> 05:54.634
Dedicated drawer
to bring olives

05:54.701 --> 05:56.569
up to Mediterranean
room temperature.

05:56.637 --> 05:58.754
And look, this cabinet
is also a dishwasher.

05:58.822 --> 06:00.456
We put our dishes
away dirty.

06:00.524 --> 06:02.325
Son of a bitch!

06:02.392 --> 06:04.827
We did all of this in
just under three months.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.128
Three months
of living hell.

06:06.196 --> 06:08.397
It put such a strain
on our civil union.

06:08.465 --> 06:10.867
We're fortunate to have
such a strong relationship.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.536
Hey, Mom, maybe you and Dad
should redo our kitchen.

06:13.603 --> 06:15.922
(both laugh)

06:15.989 --> 06:18.491
You two shouldn't even
think about a renovation.

06:18.559 --> 06:21.961
Are, are you implying our
marriage isn't strong enough

06:22.029 --> 06:24.463
to withstand a little
construction project?

06:24.531 --> 06:27.400
50% of all marriages don't
survive a home remodel.

06:27.467 --> 06:29.001
First of all, don't
pretend you're married.

06:29.069 --> 06:30.436
It implies equality.

06:30.504 --> 06:33.206
Second of all, our marriage
can survive anything.

06:33.273 --> 06:34.423
Oh, yeah,
how about this?

06:34.491 --> 06:36.292
If your marriage survives
the remodel,

06:36.360 --> 06:38.294
we'll pay
for the whole thing.

06:39.997 --> 06:44.000
But if it doesn't, we get
your marriage license.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.968
You know that's not going
to make your marriage legal.

06:46.036 --> 06:48.204
No, I know, but it'll be
a moral victory.

06:48.272 --> 06:50.907
We'll cross your names out
and write our names in,

06:50.974 --> 06:52.808
like we did
on the Vietnam Memorial.

06:52.876 --> 06:55.144
(both laughing)

06:55.195 --> 06:57.079
(laughing wildly)

06:57.147 --> 06:58.147
You're on.

06:58.215 --> 06:59.782
This'll be easy
for us

06:59.850 --> 07:01.617
because we're a team.

I will sing the cancan song

07:40.900 --> 07:42.200
So you're really
going to renovate?

07:42.268 --> 07:43.601
That's right.

07:43.669 --> 07:45.136
How else are we going
to prove to Greg and Terry

07:45.204 --> 07:46.488
how strong our marriage is?

07:46.555 --> 07:47.906
Seems a little
juvenile,

07:47.973 --> 07:49.858
but as long as we're
getting new cabinets...

(grunts)

07:52.661 --> 07:54.145
(laughs)

07:54.213 --> 07:55.747
So have you hired
a contractor yet?

07:55.815 --> 07:57.182
I could do this
job for you.

07:57.249 --> 07:58.550
Let me show you
some of my work.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.318
I built the addition
onto this home.

08:00.386 --> 08:02.187
Did it on time
and on budget,

08:02.254 --> 08:04.556
including low-flow
gumdrop toilets.

08:04.623 --> 08:05.757
We're not
using you, Roger.

08:05.825 --> 08:06.891
We already
hired someone.

08:06.959 --> 08:07.876
(knocking)

08:07.943 --> 08:10.912
Everyone, meet Uzi Knesset.

08:10.980 --> 08:11.946
Hello, hello.

08:12.014 --> 08:13.815
An Israeli?

08:13.883 --> 08:16.651
All right.

08:16.719 --> 08:17.886
Okay, let's
get started.

08:17.953 --> 08:19.053
What color would you
like the kitchen?

08:19.121 --> 08:20.588
BOTH:
White.

08:20.656 --> 08:22.891
Great, now I have several
different shades of white

08:22.958 --> 08:24.125
for you to choose from.

08:24.193 --> 08:26.561
Snowflake.
Mother's Milk.

Modern.

(gunshot)

19:05.642 --> 19:07.376
Aah! My hip-hop hooray arm!

19:09.546 --> 19:11.397
(laughs)

19:11.465 --> 19:12.949
They only fired 87.

19:13.016 --> 19:15.251
I knew there was one left.

19:15.319 --> 19:16.919
Why, Rain Kid?

19:16.987 --> 19:18.237
(grunts)

19:18.305 --> 19:21.858
Never touch
a fat boy's candy.

19:21.925 --> 19:24.861
Aah! No! Oh, no!

19:24.928 --> 19:26.312
(yelling)

19:29.016 --> 19:30.683
(humming)

19:30.751 --> 19:32.251
♪ Like ♪ (humming)

19:32.319 --> 19:34.287
♪ Bap, diddly
diddly doo wap... ♪

19:34.354 --> 19:36.823
(Francine humming)

19:36.907 --> 19:38.674
♪ Like ♪ (humming)

19:38.742 --> 19:41.110

19:41.178 --> 19:42.578
(sighs)

19:47.084 --> 19:48.167
Stan?

19:48.252 --> 19:50.503
Francine!

19:50.587 --> 19:52.388
Stan.

19:52.455 --> 19:53.773
Francine!

19:53.841 --> 19:55.641
Stan!

19:55.726 --> 19:57.143
Francine!

19:57.211 --> 19:59.461
Stan!
Francine!

20:01.982 --> 20:03.599
Stan!

20:04.718 --> 20:06.018
Francine!

20:06.103 --> 20:07.770
I miss holding you!

20:07.838 --> 20:10.072
Start making dinner immediately!

20:10.140 --> 20:12.575
Stan! Stan!
Francine!

20:12.642 --> 20:14.360
Stan!
Francine!

20:14.428 --> 20:16.412
Stan!

20:21.752 --> 20:24.203
(rumbling)

20:28.058 --> 20:29.709
(car alarm wailing)

20:30.878 --> 20:33.212
Oh!

20:33.280 --> 20:34.614
Take a picture.

20:34.681 --> 20:35.815
It'll last longer.

20:35.883 --> 20:38.434
I love you, Stan.

20:38.502 --> 20:40.002
Me, too, baby.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.205
But Greg and
Terry were right.

20:42.272 --> 20:44.340
Our marriage isn't strong
enough to survive a remodel.

20:44.408 --> 20:45.641
So let's not remodel.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.043
Exactly.

20:47.110 --> 20:48.477
We're great together,

20:48.545 --> 20:51.047
as long as we don't put
any stress on our marriage.

20:51.114 --> 20:52.748
It's like a rickety
bridge that's fine,

20:52.816 --> 20:55.117
as long as you don't drive
anything heavy over it.

20:55.185 --> 20:57.920
You know, I liked
the house the way it was.

20:57.988 --> 20:59.322
So did I.

20:59.389 --> 21:00.990
Imperfect, like us.

21:01.058 --> 21:02.358
(siren chirping)

21:02.409 --> 21:04.076
U.S. Immigration!
Where is she?

21:04.144 --> 21:05.962
Run, Annabelle!
