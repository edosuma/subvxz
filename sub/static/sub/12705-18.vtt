00:01.135 --> 00:02.870
Previously:
How'd you like
to get your hands

00:02.903 --> 00:04.838
on the Books of Ascension?

00:04.871 --> 00:06.839
You got the books?

00:06.873 --> 00:09.477
We want to take
Angel's soul away.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.878
No!

00:10.910 --> 00:12.080
(growls)

00:13.881 --> 00:16.082
The mayor's built this town
for demons to feed on,

00:16.117 --> 00:18.152
and come graduation day,
he's getting paid.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.486
You think we missed anything?

00:19.519 --> 00:21.155
I think we know
everything she knows.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.091
You played me!

00:23.123 --> 00:25.092
I know you only did
what I asked.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.894
I never wanted it
to go that far.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.204
(grunts)

00:43.911 --> 00:46.246
You demons can't resist a
run-and-stumble, can you?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.496
(grunts)

01:05.233 --> 01:08.236
One down... one gone.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.481
(wolf howling)

01:21.515 --> 01:23.751
*

02:12.300 --> 02:15.368
(indistinct conversations)

02:15.402 --> 02:17.971
So, scabby demon got away?

02:18.004 --> 02:19.306
Scabby demon
number two got away.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.108
Scabby demon number one,

02:21.140 --> 02:22.975
big check
in the slay column.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.377
I don't like this whole
"no mouth" thing.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.180
It's disquieting.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.181
Well, no mouth
means no teeth...

02:28.216 --> 02:30.783
Unless they have them
somewhere else.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.286
GILES:
Good morning, girls.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.787
We've been researching

02:33.820 --> 02:36.824
the, uh, mayor's
forthcoming ascension.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.025
It's pretty riveting stuff.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.126
What do we know?

02:39.158 --> 02:41.694
What don't we know?

02:41.728 --> 02:44.131
Tell her, Giles.
Well, based on
the supposed date--

02:44.163 --> 02:46.133
graduation day-- and the mayor

02:46.165 --> 02:47.300
being impervious to harm,

02:47.335 --> 02:49.036
I've cross-referenced...

02:49.069 --> 02:51.739
He's a cross-referencing fool.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.040
And I've eliminated
several possibilities.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.977
It's not the ritual flaying
of the demon Azorath,

02:57.009 --> 02:58.246
nor the, um...

03:03.116 --> 03:04.617
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.320
That was kind of an anticlimax.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.756
BUFFY:
We don't know anything?

03:08.788 --> 03:10.657
The whole Faith-Angel thing
was for nothing?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.991
No, no, no. Um,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.561
if nothing else, Angel's charade

03:13.593 --> 03:14.927
has brought Faith's treachery

03:14.961 --> 03:17.365
into the open,
and this information

03:17.397 --> 03:18.998
about the ascension
will prove

03:19.032 --> 03:22.902
useful, eventually.
I just need to put it together.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.372
Terribly sorry.
I was detained.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.441
Official council business.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.242
Mr. Giles, you
were speaking?

03:29.276 --> 03:30.544
I was just

03:30.578 --> 03:32.045
filling Buffy in on my progress

03:32.079 --> 03:33.112
regarding the research

03:33.146 --> 03:34.114
of the ascension.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.549
Oh. And
what took up

03:35.582 --> 03:37.418
the rest of the minute?

03:39.218 --> 03:41.054
TouchÃ©.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.923
Of course, my work
is unofficial.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.891
I'm sure, however,

03:44.925 --> 03:48.228
with the resources
of the council at your disposal,

03:48.262 --> 03:50.264
you will have something to add.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.269
Well...

03:55.302 --> 03:56.603
I am pleased to state,

03:56.637 --> 03:58.237
with certainty,

03:58.271 --> 03:59.606
that the demon Azorath

03:59.639 --> 04:01.074
will not
in any way be

04:01.108 --> 04:02.342
involved in...

04:04.412 --> 04:05.979
I'm sure we'll
find out more soon.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.222
The demon Azorath?

04:15.254 --> 04:18.158
So, have you talked
to Angel lately?

04:18.190 --> 04:20.226
Not really.

04:20.259 --> 04:22.829
Seeing him bad,
even pretend-bad...

04:22.862 --> 04:24.264
and with Faith...

04:24.298 --> 04:26.834
He only kissed her
for the greater good.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.670
I don't know.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.805
To the naked eye,
it looked like fun.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.139
Or maybe it wasn't.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.942
Maybe ...he wasn't even tempted.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.478
I just wish I could be sure.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.480
As always, I advise you to ask.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.649
Like he'd tell me?

04:41.682 --> 04:44.651
STUDENT:
Hogan.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.586
Great game, man.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.423
HOGAN:
Thanks.
Hogan Martin thinks he's so hot.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.158
Like we should
all be awed by him

04:51.191 --> 04:53.461
'cause he can put
a ball in a net.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.661
Hey, Xander.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.829
He said my name.
He knows my name.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.500
Hey, Will. Hey.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.168
Hi.
Um... look,
I can't make it

05:02.201 --> 05:03.536
to the study session
after school today.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.271
Um, can we do it
fifth period?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.774
Okay. Did you
finish the reading?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.143
Most of it.
Percy.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.444
I'll finish it at lunch.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.781
That's my little trooper.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.048
I don't know
what you're doing to him.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.516
I actually heard him
complete a sentence.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.418
Had a clause and everything.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.120
Gonna watch
the game, right?

05:21.153 --> 05:22.122
Wouldn't miss it.

05:22.154 --> 05:25.125
See you, Hogan. Ladies.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.560
You're going to the game?

05:26.593 --> 05:27.995
I didn't know you
liked basketball.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.396
I didn't, either,

05:29.430 --> 05:31.064
but I've really
started getting into it.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.566
Especially now that
we're in the championships,

05:32.600 --> 05:33.867
it's so exciting.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.536
Too bad
you're patrolling,

05:35.569 --> 05:38.706
'cause we're all going.
Oz, Xander, everybody.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.340
Great.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.409
Everybody who isn't
currently Buffy.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.215
You touched one of the demons.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.519
A good touch.
Not a bad touch.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.021
Anyway, it's been
itching like crazy.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.355
No big. Just
another problem

05:56.389 --> 05:58.257
for the good people
at Lubriderm, right?

05:58.290 --> 06:00.326
This the demon in question?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.495
In the disgusting flesh.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.264
Hmm.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.098
What?

06:06.132 --> 06:09.336
It says they
can infect a host.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.406
Infect? Infect?

06:12.439 --> 06:13.906
Giles.

06:13.940 --> 06:14.675
Hmm?

06:14.708 --> 06:15.908
Infect?!

06:15.942 --> 06:17.343
Oh. Um, "In-Infect the host

06:17.377 --> 06:19.747
with an aspect of the demon."

06:19.779 --> 06:21.247
That's all it says.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.516
An aspect of the demon?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.250
It is rather terse, isn't it?

06:24.283 --> 06:25.918
You mean, like, a part of it?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.355
There could be
any number of explanations

06:28.387 --> 06:30.591
for your hand.
I mean, a new fabric softener

06:30.624 --> 06:32.526
can cause irritation.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.261
In any case,
I-I would advise

06:34.293 --> 06:37.230
not to attempt to track
the one that got away.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.867
Let's minimize your exposure.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.369
"A part of the demon."

06:42.401 --> 06:45.072
I hope it's not
the outside part.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.808
ALL:
H-O-G-A-N!

06:48.841 --> 06:50.610
It's Hogan.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.646
Go Hogan!

06:52.680 --> 06:54.413
(cheering, applause)

06:59.819 --> 07:02.889
Is it me,
or is this really lame?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.391
I don't know.
I usually enjoy lameness,

07:04.423 --> 07:05.992
and this is leaving me
kind of cold.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.762
Well, according to Freddy's
latest editorial,

07:08.795 --> 07:10.262
"The pep rally
is a place for

07:10.297 --> 07:12.331
"pseudo-prostitutes
to provoke men

07:12.365 --> 07:13.800
"into a sexual frenzy

07:13.834 --> 07:15.334
"which, when
thwarted, results in

07:15.367 --> 07:17.670
pointless
athletic competition."

07:17.704 --> 07:20.240
And the downside being?

07:20.273 --> 07:23.276
The school paper is edging
on depressing lately.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.112
Have you guys noticed that?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.213
I don't know. I always
go straight to the obits.

07:29.315 --> 07:30.983
What are you doing, Buffy?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.451
Nothing.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.855
Checking for horns.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.990
Uh, you know, Buffy,

07:38.024 --> 07:39.692
I don't even think
Giles is right

07:39.726 --> 07:41.360
about you becoming
like a demon.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.297
I mean,
he's totally burnt, you know?

07:44.331 --> 07:46.834
Dealing with Faith
and this ascension thing.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.103
Between you and me,
he's not doing his best work.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.605
But what if he is right?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.507
I'm suddenly gonna
grow this demon part,

07:53.540 --> 07:55.141
and we don't even know
what it is.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.745
It could be claws or scales...

07:58.745 --> 07:59.713
What?

07:59.747 --> 08:01.413
Was it a boy demon?

08:02.550 --> 08:05.718
ALL:
T-O-M! It's Tom!

08:05.752 --> 08:08.288
Go Tom!

08:08.321 --> 08:11.290
They really are very good.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.826
Their spelling's improved.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.295
You know, Oz, I look
at all this beauty,

08:15.327 --> 08:17.297
all these healthy
young women,

08:17.329 --> 08:20.399
and I wonder why I ever
wasted my time on Cordelia.

08:20.432 --> 08:22.235
I mean, look at her.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.170
She's no better-looking
than the rest of 'em.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.572
None of 'em are really my...
Oh my God,

08:25.605 --> 08:27.007
he's looking at her.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.910
He's got his filthy,

08:29.942 --> 08:32.745
adult Pierce Brosny
eyes all over my Cordy.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.683
You're a very complex man,
aren't you?

08:38.051 --> 08:40.052
It's just... I'm scared, Will.

08:40.086 --> 08:43.423
There's this thing in me,
and I can't find it.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.491
I-I can't stop it.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.427
(cheering continues)
What if it
changes me?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.697
I mean, not just the way I look.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.197
All of a sudden,
I-I could be something

08:51.230 --> 08:52.765
that's not me anymore.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.902
Yeah! (whoops)

08:54.934 --> 08:57.070
Oh, sorry.
They spelled Percy,

08:57.104 --> 09:00.506
and-and I have
to show support. He's needy.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.610
But-but I heard what you
were saying, really.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.611
And-and I would be
frightened, too,

09:04.644 --> 09:06.947
but I'm sure
you're gonna be okay.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.764
Still got a mouth.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.037
Sorry.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.739
It's okay. I didn't see you,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.307
so I should've known
you were there.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.778
What are you doing here?

09:37.811 --> 09:41.114
It's a dangerous time,
you know, with Faith.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.552
Yeah, Faith.
(chuckles)

09:45.585 --> 09:48.254
She, well...

09:48.288 --> 09:50.090
Faith, what can
you say about her?

09:50.123 --> 09:52.225
I just want to make sure
that you're, you know,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.761
okay, and that-that
you're safe.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.630
And the fact that
you're right here--

09:57.664 --> 10:00.634
does that mean Faith's around?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.736
Are you keeping me safe
by tracking me,

10:03.770 --> 10:04.904
or are you tracking her?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.639
I'm tracking you.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.341
Something's bothering you.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.344
A lot of things.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.984
The most recent being
this demon.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.350
Actually, two.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.620
I touched one of them,

10:20.653 --> 10:22.655
and now I'm gonna get
a big case of the bumpies

10:22.690 --> 10:24.124
or a tail or something.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.457
Aspect of the demon.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.826
You know the drill.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.495
By rumor. But that
doesn't mean anything.

10:29.528 --> 10:32.665
I mean, sometimes demons-- they
just exaggerate their power.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.501
Demon hype. Maybe not.

10:35.534 --> 10:39.706
I spend all my time
in the dark here anyway.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.809
It's not like I'd be at a game,
you know, with my friends

10:42.842 --> 10:46.046
where someone could see me
in my new monster part.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.048
Hey.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.717
I won't let anything happen
to you if I can help it.

10:52.384 --> 10:56.056
And no matter what,
I'll always be with you.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.494
Hey, I'll love you...

11:01.528 --> 11:03.163
even if you're
covered with slime.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.701
I liked everything
until that part.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
Could you believe it?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.844
Right at the buzzer,
three points for the win.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.311
It was intense.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.013
Yeah, for a minute there,
I thought you were gonna

11:20.047 --> 11:21.849
make an expression.
Well I felt one

11:21.881 --> 11:23.515
coming on. I won't lie.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.518
Man, I've never seen anyone
jump like Hogan Martin.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.754
They should call him The Jumper.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.856
Or a name that isn't an
article of women's clothing.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.091
Hey, remember when the...

11:31.124 --> 11:32.793
Shh.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.164
Hmm. Quietness.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.899
We either lost

11:39.932 --> 11:42.735
or we won and you don't
want me to feel bad.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.171
Ooh, yeah,
it wasn't

11:44.203 --> 11:45.739
really a good game.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.073
Yeah, tall hoops,
but then tall guys.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.441
What's the point, huh?

11:48.475 --> 11:49.542
Pretty dull.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.610
Are you guys crazy?

11:50.643 --> 11:52.111
It was
an incredible game.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.114
I've never cheered so hard
in my life.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.682
I still have
knee marks

11:55.715 --> 11:56.917
on my back.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.320
From the pyramid.
(scoffs)

12:02.822 --> 12:04.256
Yeah, well,
I still bet

12:04.291 --> 12:05.926
patrolling was way better,

12:05.958 --> 12:08.128
'cause, wow-- important.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.831
Well, I thought I saw
a four-legged demon.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.801
But it was just a dog.

12:13.833 --> 12:14.802
A weredog?

12:14.835 --> 12:15.969
Regular.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.636
Tough luck.
Yeah.

12:17.669 --> 12:21.073
(indistinct conversation)

12:21.107 --> 12:23.475
XANDER:
 I wonder if she and Wesley
 have kissed.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.711
It really bugs you, huh?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.479
What?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.816
Cordelia and Wesley, smooching.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.350
Man, you read my mind.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.936
Ooh.
Ooh, whoa, there.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.903
You watch
where you're going, now.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.139
I'm sorry, Mr. Beach. I will.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.676
MR. BEACH:
 Students... If we could just
 get rid of all the students.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.846
BOY:
 When I'm a software jillionaire

12:58.879 --> 13:00.013
and you're all
 flippin' burgers,

13:00.047 --> 13:01.948
who's the loser then?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.817
GIRL:
 ...French, I said.
 How hard can it be?

13:03.850 --> 13:06.785
French babies learn it, idiot.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.522
BOY 2:
 I swear, someday my pants
 are gonna fall right off.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.827
BOY 3:
 Buffy is so beautiful.

13:14.861 --> 13:18.365
I mean, well,
 look at that body.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.969
God, I'd love to shove her
 against that locker

13:22.001 --> 13:24.636
right now and just... Ooh.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.207
BUFFY:
 Is this the thing--

13:28.240 --> 13:29.808
the aspect thing?
Because I got to say,

13:29.842 --> 13:31.543
if it is, it is way
better than a tail.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.480
I mean, I have a hard
enough time as it is

13:33.513 --> 13:34.614
finding jeans
that fit right.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.716
Buffy, slow down.

13:36.749 --> 13:40.220
Um... I'-I'm not even
convinced that

13:40.253 --> 13:43.355
this is genuine mind reading.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.825
I mean, y-you're
most likely projecting your...

13:45.859 --> 13:47.394
When I walked in
a few minutes ago,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.229
you thought, "Look at her shoes.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.197
"If a fashion magazine
told her to,

13:51.230 --> 13:53.500
she'd wear cats
strapped to her feet."

13:53.533 --> 13:55.467
I, um...

13:55.501 --> 13:57.669
The demons are telepathic.
 I should have known.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.338
That's why
 they don't need mouths.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.573
Of course. The demons
are telepathic.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.475
I know. You just told me.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.211
That's why they don't
need mouths.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.379
And you should have known.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.816
I... This is astounding.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.717
It was happening
out in the hallway.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.419
I mean, Principal Snyder
has "Walk Like an Egyptian"

14:13.452 --> 14:15.822
stuck in his head.
And the boys of this school

14:15.855 --> 14:17.657
are seriously disturbed.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.927
It's weird, but, Giles,
think about it.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.562
I mean, think about
what I could do.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.096
Well, it could be very useful.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.565
You could anticipate

14:25.597 --> 14:26.765
your opponent's every move,

14:26.798 --> 14:28.768
turn his plans against him.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.238
Oh, way better than that.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.404
Jealousy.

14:32.438 --> 14:36.375
Buffy. Right. Very good.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.278
Jealousy clearly is the tool...
GIRL: I knew that.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.081
that Iago uses
to undo Othello.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.850
But what's his motivation?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.552
What reason
does Iago give

14:45.585 --> 14:48.087
for destroying
his superior officer?

14:48.120 --> 14:50.222
"Cassio has my place.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.392
'Twixt my sheets,
 he's done my office."

14:52.424 --> 14:55.227
Well, he was passed over
for promotion.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.796
Cassio was
picked instead,

14:56.828 --> 14:59.231
and people were saying that

14:59.265 --> 15:01.201
Othello slept with his wife.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.701
WILLOW:
 Buffy did the reading?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.636
Buffy understood the reading?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.472
XANDER:
 When did she study?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.408
Was I supposed to study?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.143
Ms. Murray's kind of hot.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.544
GIRL:
 I was gonna say Cassio.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.115
Ugh. I hate her.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.816
Any other reason?

15:16.849 --> 15:18.150
Race.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.488
Um, good, Nancy.
Can't overlook that.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.923
BOY:
 Look at them, scrambling
 for the teacher's praise

15:23.956 --> 15:26.426
like pigeons
 for old bread crusts.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.995
Will, who's that guy?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.298
That's Freddy Iverson.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.400
He writes those editorials for
the school paper.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.403
He... he's sardonic.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.172
FREDDY:
 Bread crusts. That's deep.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.975
I should write that down.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.844
Is there something else
at work here?

15:44.876 --> 15:46.846
Well, he, um,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.447
he sort of admits himself

15:48.480 --> 15:51.350
that his motives are...

15:51.384 --> 15:53.852
spurious.
Uh, he, um...

15:53.885 --> 15:55.822
he does things
because

15:55.855 --> 15:58.191
he enjoys them.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.995
It's like he's not...
he's not really a person.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.364
He's a... the...

16:04.397 --> 16:06.798
dark half of Othello himself.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.934
STUDENTS:
 Whoa. Wow.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.270
Buffy.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.307
Really... very astute.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.476
I said something quite like that
in my dissertation.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.178
I know. I-I mean,

16:19.211 --> 16:22.215
I agree... with that.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.682
Yes, and doesn't that
also explain

16:23.716 --> 16:27.153
Othello's readiness
to believe Iago?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.889
Within seconds,
he turns on Desdemona.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.857
He believes that
she's been unfaithful,

16:31.890 --> 16:33.826
and we're all
like that.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.563
We all have
our little internal Iagos

16:37.596 --> 16:39.798
that tell us
our husbands

16:39.831 --> 16:41.500
or our girlfriends
or whatever

16:41.533 --> 16:43.635
don't really
love us.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.506
We can never really see
what's in someone's heart.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.712
Oh.
Oh! Sorry.

16:53.745 --> 16:55.981
Sorry about the... daytime.

16:56.014 --> 17:00.220
I just ducked out of school,
and that's when they have it.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.557
Um...you look good.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.326
I mean, I--I know
I saw you last night,

17:07.358 --> 17:09.362
but sometimes things

17:09.395 --> 17:11.530
can change real quick.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.098
I mean, really quickly.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.768
Listen to me.
I'm talking like Faith.

17:18.105 --> 17:21.673
You know, not that she was so
bad to have around.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.144
You know, before the evil.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.746
You know, I think

17:26.778 --> 17:28.580
she was hurting a lot.

17:28.615 --> 17:32.251
And some people--
protective-type people--

17:32.285 --> 17:34.886
might be drawn
to that, I guess.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.757
Well, the thing
about Faith--

17:37.789 --> 17:39.625
You can't get into my mind.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.760
How did you...

17:41.794 --> 17:43.430
Why not?

17:43.462 --> 17:45.865
It's like the mirror.
The thoughts are there,

17:45.897 --> 17:48.335
but they create
no reflection in you.

17:50.269 --> 17:53.573
You got your aspect
of the demon.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.375
Yeah.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.278
Giles doesn't know how
long it's gonna last,

17:58.310 --> 18:00.779
but it's okay. A little
headachy, but...

18:00.813 --> 18:03.082
You don't have to play games
with me, Buffy.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.152
Ever.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.621
Well, you're not exactly
Joe Here's What I'm Thinking.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.056
So, ask me.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.090
Oh, but that
would've made sense.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.559
What do you
want to know about?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.894
Faith?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.830
How I felt kissing her,
pretending to have no soul,

18:18.865 --> 18:20.467
watching you suffer?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.169
Well, since you bring it up.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.304
I hated hurting you.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.140
More than I could stand.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.510
Look, the thing about Faith...

18:31.544 --> 18:33.313
I'd understand.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.847
You know, she has
that whole

18:35.882 --> 18:37.849
"bad girl" thing
working for her.

18:37.884 --> 18:38.951
Kissing her meant nothing.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.752
I don't want a bad girl.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.555
I've done that before.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.294
I've lived a long time, Buffy,

18:47.326 --> 18:49.429
and I'm past that.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.030
I've been with dozens
of girls like her.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.633
More.

18:53.665 --> 18:56.336
Oh, this honesty
stuff is fun.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.338
And there's no comparison.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.340
In 243 years,

19:01.374 --> 19:04.544
I've loved exactly one person.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.114
Oh.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.250
It is me, right?

19:11.317 --> 19:14.421
Next time, just ask.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.490
Okay.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.528
And Buffy,
careful with this gift.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.497
A lot of things that seem strong
and good and powerful--

19:24.530 --> 19:26.699
they can be painful.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.068
Like, say, immortality?

19:30.102 --> 19:32.137
Exactly.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
I'm dying to get rid of that.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.741
Funny.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.676
I'm a funny guy.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.145
She can read our minds?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.414
Our every impulse and fantasy?

19:42.449 --> 19:45.050
Every one.
XANDER: Oh, God.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.752
CORDELIA:
 I don't see what this
 has to do with me.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.921
I don't see what this
has to do with me.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.722
Well, I think
it's great, right?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.659
I mean, you enjoy your
other slayer powers.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.394
Yeah, it'll be fun.
And did you see

19:54.426 --> 19:55.994
Nancy Doyle's face
in English class today?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.396
Yeah.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.030
She's hardly even
 human anymore.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.567
How can I be
 her friend now?

20:00.599 --> 20:01.933
She doesn't need me.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.569
No, I do need you.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.605
CORDELIA:
Okay, what are you
talking about?

20:05.637 --> 20:08.508
Because you are
so creepy right now.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.609
GILES:
I think there must be, uh,

20:10.643 --> 20:13.346
some precedence for
occurrences such as this.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.681
I'll-I'll research it.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.348
Wesley, can you
give me a hand?

20:16.383 --> 20:18.951
Of course. Where do you
think we should start?

20:18.984 --> 20:21.520
OZ:
 I am my thoughts.
 If they exist in her,

20:21.554 --> 20:24.290
Buffy contains everything
 that is me, and she becomes me.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.791
I cease to exist.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.125
Hmm.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.694
XANDER:
 What am I gonna do?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
I think about sex all the time.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.265
Sex. Help.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.567
Four times five is 30.
 Five times six is 32.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.604
Naked girls. Naked women.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.239
Naked Buffy. Oh, stop me.

20:40.272 --> 20:43.809
God, Xander,
is that all you think about?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.112
Actually? Bye.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.782
Xander has just
illustrated something.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.719
Chances are you're all
going to be thinking

20:52.751 --> 20:55.221
whatever you least
want Buffy to hear.

20:55.253 --> 20:58.156
It's a question, of course,
of mental discipline.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.625
He's right. Uh...

20:59.659 --> 21:00.893
WESLEY:
 Look at Cordelia.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.461
No, don't look at Cordelia.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.262
She's a student.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.998
Oh, I am bad.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.134
I'm a bad, bad man.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.136
Excuse me.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.105
What's it like, Buffy?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.241
I don't know, I mean,
it's a little weird.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.278
But... look, please
don't for a second think

21:19.311 --> 21:21.113
that I don't need you,
because I do.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.949
And I want to share this
with you.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.484
It's like all
these doors are opening

21:25.518 --> 21:26.986
to all these little worlds,

21:27.019 --> 21:28.488
and I can just walk
right inside.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.855
OZ:
 No one else exists, either.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.857
Buffy is all of us.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.026
We think, therefore she is.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.363
WILLOW:
 She knows so much.
 She knows what Oz is thinking.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.297
I never know that.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.199
Before long, she'll know him
 better than I do.

21:40.231 --> 21:41.299
No, don't think that.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.502
I can't help it, Buffy.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.905
I'm sorry. I-I just can't.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.542
Uh, if you don't need me,
I'm gonna

21:50.576 --> 21:52.378
follow the redhead.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.383
I guess I won't be
writing that book--

21:56.415 --> 21:58.284
Winning Friends
 Through Telepathy.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.452
CORDELIA:
 Whatever. I wonder
 when I can go.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.288
Whatever. Can I go?

22:03.321 --> 22:05.057
Excuse me. Can you hear me
thinking in here?

22:05.090 --> 22:06.692
I could go out into the hall.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.728
You know what, you stay.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.497
I'm getting a headache.
I'll go.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.503
BOY:
 She is so hot.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.238
GIRL:
 I hate my body.

22:19.270 --> 22:20.807
BOY 2:
 I swear, I will scream
 from boredom.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.240
No one's ever gonna love me.

22:22.273 --> 22:24.042
GIRL:
 What if I never get breasts?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.512
BOY 3:
 I can't believe
 the test is today.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.681
MR. BEACH:
 Get rid of the students.
 It's that easy.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.017
GIRL 2:
 What if I'm the last virgin
 in the world?

22:31.049 --> 22:32.551
NANCY:
 He has the cutest butt.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.721
Ugh, I hate her.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.559
Here. It's happened before.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.194
A man in Ecuador,
quite recently.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.896
Can we contact him?

22:44.931 --> 22:47.599
I'd say not. He can't
communicate with anyone.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.501
Dead?

22:49.536 --> 22:52.337
No, he's in complete isolation.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.640
The power--

22:54.874 --> 22:56.643
he can't shut it off.

22:59.244 --> 23:00.579
GIRL:
 It's got to get better.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.582
Please tell me it gets better.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.351
BOY: I hate school.
BOY 2: Am I normal?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.854
BOY 3:
 I never should've taken
 honors math, I'm too stupid.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.689
Are you through
with the mashed potatoes?

23:09.721 --> 23:11.356
GIRL:
 ...gonna get
 my driver's license.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.960
JONATHAN:
 She doesn't even know I'm here.

23:13.992 --> 23:17.063
BOY: I want a car so bad.
FREDDY: Look at everybody.
 They think this matters.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.599
GIRL: Come on. Come on.
 (several voices overlapping)

23:20.633 --> 23:23.569
GIRL 2: Didn't she wear
 that skirt yesterday?
BOY: She's okay.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.237
BOY 4:
 She has the sweetest face
 I ever saw.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.073
If I stand in just
 the right place,

23:27.105 --> 23:30.576
I can sort of see into
 the arm hole of her top.

23:30.609 --> 23:33.712
GIRL:
 The test is today.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.148
(many overlapping voices)

23:47.794 --> 23:49.095
(sinister voice):
 This time tomorrow,

23:49.127 --> 23:51.430
I'll kill you all.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.576
BOY: Way to...
BOY 2: ...that's not me.

24:04.611 --> 24:08.446
(many overlapping voices)

24:10.549 --> 24:11.784
BOY:
 She's gone nuts.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.184
GIRL:
 I hate being here.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.989
(many overlapping voices)

24:17.022 --> 24:20.492
BOY:
 Buffy's such a show-off.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.961
JONATHAN:
 She touched me.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.963
(overlapping voices continue)

24:44.717 --> 24:46.786
WILLOW: I think she's waking up.
XANDER: She's okay.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.788
GILES: Oh, thank goodness.
XANDER: Her eyes are opening.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.189
CORDELIA:
 I'm cold.

24:50.221 --> 24:51.222
Are you all right?

24:51.257 --> 24:52.858
I told them not
to move you.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.561
They probably
severed your spinal cord.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.564
I'm okay.
Buffy...

24:57.596 --> 24:59.365
No, really, I'm okay.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.733
Listen, there's a killer
in the cafeteria.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.702
See? I've been saying for years
that the lunch lady's

25:03.736 --> 25:05.403
gonna do us all in
with that mulligan stew.

25:05.436 --> 25:06.806
Xander.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.207
I mean, what the hell's
a mulligan?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.142
Someone was thinking it.
They thought,

25:10.175 --> 25:12.077
"This time tomorrow,
I'll kill you all."

25:12.111 --> 25:13.546
I have to find them.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.147
Well, did you
recognize a-a voice?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.584
No.

25:17.616 --> 25:18.917
Boy or girl?

25:18.951 --> 25:20.086
I don't know.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.354
I mean, it was hardly human.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.522
It was so full
of anger and pain.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.424
(many overlapping voices)

25:26.458 --> 25:29.361
Buffy, you can't.

25:29.394 --> 25:31.597
No, I have to find them.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.065
Are you sure
they meant it?

25:33.098 --> 25:34.601
XANDER: Yeah, I mean,
who hasn't just idly thought

25:34.634 --> 25:36.868
about taking out the whole place
with a semiautomatic?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.506
I said idly.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.240
I know the difference.

25:42.273 --> 25:45.510
He... she... whoever--
they meant it,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.346
They're gonna do it.

25:47.378 --> 25:48.881
GILES: She looks so tired.
WILLOW: How horrible.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.281
CORDELIA: I'm not
 getting any warmer.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.250
XANDER: I'll bet it was Hogan.
 Who could it be?

25:52.284 --> 25:54.185
Shut up!

25:54.220 --> 25:55.922
(sighs) I'm sorry.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.825
Just, could you guys
not think so loud?

26:00.392 --> 26:01.794
Or so much?

26:01.827 --> 26:03.461
Buffy, you should go home.
I'll take you home.

26:03.494 --> 26:05.030
Yeah. Okay. No.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.098
Look, I need you guys
to go back to the cafeteria.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.768
Make a list of everyone
who's there.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.269
We have to find the killer
before lunch tomorrow.

26:10.301 --> 26:11.470
WILLOW:
We'll do it, Buffy.

26:11.502 --> 26:13.105
A list of all the students.

26:13.138 --> 26:16.107
Yeah, Nancy was there.
She's scary.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.910
And, uh, oh,
teachers too.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.712
Uh, Mr. Beach,
he thought something
Come on.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.213
about getting rid
of all the students.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.784
(sighs)
I can't shut it out, Giles.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.219
It's like this invasion
of my head.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.820
It's like there
are these strangers

26:28.855 --> 26:30.556
walking around in there.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.958
Look at this. (sighs)

26:31.990 --> 26:34.393
I can't even be
around people anymore,

26:34.425 --> 26:35.728
not that
they're really clamoring

26:35.761 --> 26:38.631
to be near me anyway,
even you.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.098
Well, I'm sorry, Buffy.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.733
It's hard for all of us.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.903
But Wesley and I are looking
for a way to help.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.806
But I'll be okay, right?

26:46.838 --> 26:48.941
I mean, even if you
can't get rid of it?

26:48.974 --> 26:51.576
You'll be fine,
I promise.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.612
GILES: If it doesn't go away,
 she'll go insane.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.481
WILLOW:
 I think we have everyone

26:56.515 --> 26:58.416
that was in the cafeteria.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.951
I'll do some computer work;

26:59.986 --> 27:02.153
match it against
the FBI mass murderer profiles,

27:02.188 --> 27:04.589
see if maybe we can rule
some people out.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.424
XANDER: I'm still having
trouble with the fact

27:06.458 --> 27:08.928
that one of us is just gonna gun
everybody down for no reason.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.964
Yeah, because that never happens
in American high schools.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.333
It's bordering on trendy
at this point.

27:14.365 --> 27:16.434
Besides which,
Sunnydale High,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.604
center of evil
and all that.

27:18.636 --> 27:20.105
Let's get to work.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.673
We have till
lunchtime tomorrow...

27:21.708 --> 27:23.509
we hope.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.345
JOYCE: There.

27:26.377 --> 27:27.445
You look better already.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.214
Thanks, Mom.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.651
I'm, uh, I'm just gonna
get you another pillow.

27:32.684 --> 27:33.720
I really don't need one.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.823
But you need another blanket.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.925
Uh, Mom, I'm fine.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.330
How, uh, about some soup?

27:45.364 --> 27:47.365
Chicken and stars?
Mom, please,

27:47.398 --> 27:49.300
just come sit with me.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.738
Um, I've, uh...

27:51.770 --> 27:53.705
I've got laundry.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.942
Why are you...

27:57.375 --> 27:59.177
You had sex with Giles?

28:00.378 --> 28:02.548
You had sex with Giles?!

28:02.580 --> 28:04.316
It was the candy.
We were teenagers.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.152
On the hood
of a police car?

28:06.184 --> 28:08.755
I'll be downstairs.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.388
You feel better.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.991
Twice?!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.559
Okay, I've taken our list
and narrowed it down

28:14.593 --> 28:16.162
to a dozen strong suspects.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.430
Here are
your personalized assignments.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.432
Ooh. I was hoping
there'd be assignments.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.067
I think I should work
with Wesley.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.002
You have no shame.

28:24.036 --> 28:27.605
Oh, please. Like shame
is something to be proud of?

28:27.638 --> 28:29.508
Be quiet.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.044
Sorry, but this is important.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.779
Okay, talk to everyone
on your list

28:33.813 --> 28:36.782
and-and use
the sample questions.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.886
Today, people.

28:42.989 --> 28:47.159
Oh. Write neatly and label
your work sheets.

28:52.663 --> 28:55.401
Fantasies are fun,
aren't they, Jonathan?

28:56.602 --> 28:59.538
Uh, I guess.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.440
We all have fantasies

29:01.472 --> 29:03.375
where we're powerful

29:03.409 --> 29:05.544
and respected,

29:05.576 --> 29:08.047
where people
pay attention to us.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.215
Maybe.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.750
But sometimes the fantasy
isn't enough,

29:12.785 --> 29:14.586
is it, Jonathan?

29:14.619 --> 29:18.723
Sometimes we have to make it
so people don't ignore us,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.460
make them pay attention.

29:21.492 --> 29:25.096
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

29:25.131 --> 29:28.934
You w-want me
to pay attention?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.440
This is for the yearbook?

29:34.472 --> 29:35.740
Yeah. Personality profiles.

29:35.773 --> 29:37.175
Can you ask it again?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.010
Sure. Do you ever feel
that you've created

29:39.045 --> 29:40.346
a false persona for yourself

29:40.378 --> 29:42.181
of the guy
who does everything right,

29:42.213 --> 29:44.916
and how much of a strain does
it put on you to maintain it?

29:44.951 --> 29:47.286
Huh. Wow. Uh, I guess...

29:47.318 --> 29:49.087
Moderate strain?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.655
Is that a good answer?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.057
I want to get this right.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.027
Yeah, that's good.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.461
CORDELIA:
Hi, Mr. Beach.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.197
I was just wondering...

29:58.230 --> 30:00.598
were you planning on killing
a bunch of people tomorrow?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.301
Oh, it's for the yearbook.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.136
Okay, so turnoffs
include smoking,

30:05.171 --> 30:07.874
insensitive men
and Birkenstocks.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.608
Now, your idea of the perfect
romantic evening.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.045
Katie, let's start with you.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.680
Freddy?

30:38.703 --> 30:40.172
MAN:
 I should've just quit.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.540
WOMAN: Look at him smiling,
 like he thinks

30:42.574 --> 30:44.210
I don't know about her.
WOMAN 2:
 ...we're gonna have a baby.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.345
MAN 2: She doesn't know a thing.
 I'm so happy.

30:46.377 --> 30:48.079
I can't believe
 I'm getting away with this.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.915
WOMAN 3: One more drink.
 That'll do it.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.185
MAN:
 20 years with that company.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.854
WOMAN: You think I can't
 smell her perfume?

30:55.887 --> 30:57.323
WOMAN 3:
 It's just a little drink.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.891
MAN: He shouldn't even
 be the boss.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.726
WOMAN 3: The bottle's
 almost empty anyway.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.028
WOMAN 2: Wait till next time he
 comes home smelling like that.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.463
(overlapping voices)

31:11.737 --> 31:13.672
Well, seems to be
coming along all right.

31:13.704 --> 31:15.942
Yes. Buffy's
being driven mad,

31:15.974 --> 31:17.675
we have no proof
that this is gonna work,

31:17.709 --> 31:19.545
and it still requires the heart
of the second demon,

31:19.577 --> 31:22.181
which we have no idea
how to get without the slayer.

31:22.213 --> 31:26.585
Negative thinking
doesn't solve problems.

31:26.617 --> 31:28.554
Who is going to get
the demon heart?

31:28.586 --> 31:31.156
Berk.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.398
(growling)

31:56.448 --> 31:57.583
(growling)

32:15.933 --> 32:17.236
GIRL: Do I often imagine

32:17.269 --> 32:20.105
classmates are spying on me

32:20.138 --> 32:22.141
or otherwise
acting suspiciously?

32:22.173 --> 32:23.474
Right.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.045
Not till just now.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.648
What?

32:30.682 --> 32:32.117
Talk louder, dude.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.319
I'm just saying
it's got to be frustrating...

32:34.353 --> 32:36.587
having this secret.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.457
You got to be kind of
filling up with resentment,

32:38.490 --> 32:42.094
unexpressed rage
just waiting to burst out...

32:42.127 --> 32:44.596
today at lunch?

32:44.630 --> 32:46.632
(loudly):
What secret? Being gay?

32:46.664 --> 32:49.934
Man, I'm out.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.270
I'm so out I've got my grandma
fixing me up with guys.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.973
That's, uh... nice.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.344
But it sounds like, uh...

32:58.376 --> 32:59.644
you're having
a rough time with it?

32:59.677 --> 33:01.113
No. (chuckles)

33:01.146 --> 33:02.847
Look...

33:02.881 --> 33:04.482
Just do it.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.653
That weird
Freddy Iverson guy

33:07.685 --> 33:09.954
that does the school paper?
He's gay?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.223
No, dude, but I bet
he'd put in like a...

33:12.258 --> 33:14.192
coming-out announcement
for you.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.662
Something tasteful.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.969
(knocking)

33:24.001 --> 33:25.570
Freddy?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.807
He's the only one
we couldn't find?

33:28.839 --> 33:30.175
Yeah. Freddy Iverson.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.977
The newspaper guy?

33:32.009 --> 33:34.512
But we can't figure out it's him
without the work sheet, right?

33:34.546 --> 33:35.913
Uh, we do have this, people.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.516
Today's editorial titled

33:37.548 --> 33:39.585
"Big Game Draws Mindless
Brain-Dead Mob."

33:39.617 --> 33:41.353
Does he mention
the cheerleaders?

33:41.386 --> 33:43.489
Because we were on.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.192
(groaning)

33:46.224 --> 33:47.992
JOYCE:
I can't stand this.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.896
I keep wondering if I'm
hurting her with my thoughts.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.164
You're not.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.665
Not anymore.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.435
She can't pick one thought
out of the...

33:57.469 --> 34:00.271
out of the din.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.973
(banging on door)

34:08.880 --> 34:10.215
I got it.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.420
No. (groans)

34:14.452 --> 34:15.920
I'm gonna help you.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.123
Who?

34:21.293 --> 34:23.393
All right.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.630
(coughs, groans)

34:24.663 --> 34:26.164
Shh.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.371
(groaning)

34:33.405 --> 34:35.806
Giles!

34:46.083 --> 34:48.454
*

35:15.681 --> 35:17.849
Angel.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.786
Thank God.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.753
Are you all right?

35:22.788 --> 35:25.456
Do you hear thoughts?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.592
No.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.360
Did you find the killer?

35:29.394 --> 35:30.528
(door opens)

35:33.298 --> 35:36.101
Okay, Oz, you got me.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.536
What are your friends
gonna do, hold me down?

35:38.570 --> 35:39.704
You better believe it, buster.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.840
You can't threaten a big murder

35:41.873 --> 35:43.775
without getting us
pretty darn ticked.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.545
Murder? What murder?

35:46.577 --> 35:48.112
You're not here
about the review?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.347
The review?

35:49.380 --> 35:52.217
Yeah. Last Thursday?

35:56.222 --> 35:58.123
"Dingoes Ate My Baby
played their instruments

35:58.155 --> 36:00.326
"as if they had plump
Polish sausages

36:00.358 --> 36:01.927
taped to their fingers."

36:02.893 --> 36:04.396
Sorry, man.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.865
No. It's fair.

36:07.898 --> 36:10.068
I just get a lot of hate mail,
and I thought you were gonna

36:10.101 --> 36:11.802
come and deliver
some personally.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.405
Hey, if you find
any tasteful announcement

36:13.438 --> 36:14.672
about me from Larry...

36:14.706 --> 36:16.407
Xander, we have
to figure this out.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.909
We have no shot.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.644
The killer could be anyone.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.846
We lose.

36:20.878 --> 36:23.081
BUFFY: We still have
a few minutes.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.083
Buffy.
You're okay.

36:25.115 --> 36:27.318
Can you hear thoughts?

36:27.353 --> 36:30.155
Just when I wasn't
thinking about sex.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.690
Okay. Here's the new plan:

36:31.722 --> 36:33.224
We're gonna get Snyder
to evacuate the school

36:33.259 --> 36:34.492
and just hope the killer's
not waiting outside.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.561
CORDELIA:
"By this time tomorrow

36:35.594 --> 36:36.827
"you'll all know
what I've done.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.063
"I'm sure you understand
that I had to do it,

36:39.097 --> 36:42.000
"and that although
death is never easy,

36:42.032 --> 36:43.835
it's the only way."

36:43.869 --> 36:46.838
God. Doesn't anyone write in
to praise the cheerleaders?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.440
We are so unsung.

36:49.474 --> 36:50.576
WILLOW:
Jonathan.

36:50.608 --> 36:52.543
(groans) I had him in my grasp.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.612
Slippery weasel.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.114
BUFFY:
Split up. Find him.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.900
Jonathan.

37:14.932 --> 37:17.568
Are you in here?

37:20.472 --> 37:22.239
Jonathan.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.474
Jonathan!

37:24.675 --> 37:26.344
Ooh. Jell-O.

37:50.168 --> 37:52.269
*

38:16.561 --> 38:18.630
(scoffs)
I could've done that.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.376
Get away from me.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.681
Okay, Jonathan, you want
to point that somewhere else?

38:35.713 --> 38:38.983
Don't you try and stop me.

38:39.016 --> 38:40.552
No.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.219
No, no stopping.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.856
Just here for the view.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.057
Hey, look. City Hall.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.226
Go away.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.063
Never gonna happen.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.831
You think I won't use this?

38:53.864 --> 38:56.802
I don't know, Jonathan.
I just--

38:56.835 --> 38:59.269
Stop doing that.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.206
Doing what?

39:02.239 --> 39:05.577
Stop saying my name
like we're friends.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.646
We're not friends.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.048
You all think I'm an idiot.

39:11.081 --> 39:12.684
A short idiot.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.387
I don't.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.693
I don't think about you
much at all.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.929
Nobody here really does.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.965
Bugs you, doesn't it?

39:28.867 --> 39:32.237
You have all this pain,
all these feelings,

39:32.269 --> 39:35.273
and nobody's really
paying attention.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.708
You think I just want attention?

39:37.742 --> 39:39.445
No. I think you're up
in the clock tower

39:39.478 --> 39:41.579
with a high-powered rifle
because you want to blend in.

39:41.612 --> 39:44.081
Believe it or not, Jonathan,

39:44.114 --> 39:47.184
I understand about the pain.

39:47.217 --> 39:49.119
Oh, right...

39:49.153 --> 39:51.188
'Cause the burden
of being beautiful and athletic,

39:51.222 --> 39:52.423
that's a crippler.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.427
You know what? I was wrong.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.327
You are an idiot.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.599
My life happens to,
on occasion,

40:01.632 --> 40:04.034
suck beyond the telling of it,

40:04.068 --> 40:07.438
sometimes more
than I can handle.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.974
And it's not just mine.

40:10.007 --> 40:13.378
Every single person down there
is ignoring your pain

40:13.411 --> 40:16.081
because they're too busy
with their own.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.918
The beautiful ones...

40:19.951 --> 40:21.786
the popular ones...

40:21.820 --> 40:24.755
the guys that pick on you.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.793
Everyone.

40:32.463 --> 40:35.266
If you could hear
what they were feeling--

40:35.300 --> 40:37.001
the loneliness,

40:37.034 --> 40:39.170
the confusion...

40:40.371 --> 40:42.673
It looks quiet
down there.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.077
It's not.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.378
It's deafening.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.286
You know, I could've
taken that by now.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.324
I know.

41:04.730 --> 41:07.032
I'd rather do it this way.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.280
I just wanted it to stop.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.949
Yeah, well, mass murder?

41:23.981 --> 41:26.050
Not really doctor recommended
for that kind of pain.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.786
Besides, prison, you know,

41:27.818 --> 41:29.054
it's a lot like high school,
only instead of noogies--

41:29.086 --> 41:30.889
What are you talking about?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.657
Actions having consequences.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.159
You know, stuff like that.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.693
Well, I...

41:35.726 --> 41:38.228
I wouldn't ever hurt anybody.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.268
I came up here to kill myself.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.759
Hey!
Rat poison!

42:07.793 --> 42:08.994
Rat poison!

42:09.027 --> 42:10.762
Drop your spoons.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.262
Step away from the spoons.

42:15.532 --> 42:16.702
(girl screams)

42:19.137 --> 42:20.905
Okay, let's calm down.

42:20.938 --> 42:22.608
Vermin.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.208
You're all vermin.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.777
You come in here
and you eat,

42:26.811 --> 42:29.614
and you eat filth.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.282
I don't see this
being settled with logic.

42:51.802 --> 42:53.771
So you're feeling better
about Angel?

42:53.804 --> 42:55.740
Well, we talked.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.541
And then he ripped out
the heart of a demon,

42:57.574 --> 42:59.744
fed it to me,
and then we talked some more.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.545
See? That's how
it should work.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.748
GILES:
Morning.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.248
Hi, Giles.
Hey.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.384
Oh, I should get
to the yearbook office.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.385
I'm gonna give 'em
the murderer profiles.

43:08.418 --> 43:10.121
They're really
a good read. (chuckles)

43:10.155 --> 43:11.789
Bye.
See ya.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.423
How are you?

43:13.458 --> 43:15.492
Loving the quiet.
Nobody in here but me.

43:15.525 --> 43:17.461
Jonathan. How's he?

43:17.494 --> 43:19.130
Pretty crappy.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.498
His parents are freaking.
He got suspended.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.268
And toting
a piece to school,

43:23.300 --> 43:25.469
not exactly winning him
a place with the in-crowd.

43:25.503 --> 43:27.905
But I think he's dealing.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.840
Well, it's good of you
to check on him.

43:29.875 --> 43:32.077
Well, it's nice to be able
to help someone

43:32.110 --> 43:33.443
in a non-slaying capacity.

43:33.478 --> 43:36.347
Except, he's starting
to get that look.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.416
You know, like he's
gonna ask me to prom.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.585
Well, it'd probably be good
for his self-esteem if you...

43:41.619 --> 43:43.688
Oh, come on.
What am I, Saint Buffy?

43:43.722 --> 43:45.657
He's like 3 feet tall.

43:45.690 --> 43:48.793
I'm glad to see you've recovered
from your psychic encounter

43:48.827 --> 43:50.260
more or less intact.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.596
Feel up to some training?

43:51.628 --> 43:53.463
Sure. We can work out
after school.

43:53.498 --> 43:57.101
You know, if you're not too busy
having sex with my mother.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.536
(grunts)

44:35.039 --> 44:37.507
Grr. Argh.
