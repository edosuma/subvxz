<i>I'm that bitch.</i>

00:23.981 --> 00:25.113
<i>You know.</i>

00:25.115 --> 00:28.083
<i>The one every woman
wishes she could be.</i>

00:28.085 --> 00:32.020
<i>The one every man wishes
he could be with.</i>

00:32.022 --> 00:38.859
<i>My name is Jessica Bell.
My friends call me Jessa.</i>

00:38.861 --> 00:43.999
<i>See...
How do I begin?</i>

00:44.001 --> 00:48.969
<i>He's my lover...
and her husband.</i>

00:48.971 --> 00:54.575
<i>Yeah, I mean, she has the ring,
she has the marriage license,</i>

00:54.577 --> 00:57.078
<i>but I have him.</i>

00:57.080 --> 01:01.749
<i>And in this game,
as far as I'm concerned,</i>

01:01.751 --> 01:04.953
<i>there can only be one winner.</i>

01:04.955 --> 01:06.757
Me.

01:18.235 --> 01:19.968
Ma, what's burning?

01:19.970 --> 01:22.704
Huh? Oh, shoot!

01:22.706 --> 01:25.239
Oh, Kieren, hand me
that towel, baby.

01:25.241 --> 01:27.041
I was trying to
make breakfast for Daddy

01:27.043 --> 01:28.710
before his fishing trip.

01:28.712 --> 01:32.581
You? Cook?
Is it Flashback Friday?

01:32.583 --> 01:33.915
Oh, really?

01:34.818 --> 01:36.718
- Oh, wait, can I have this orange?
- No!

01:36.720 --> 01:38.085
- Why not?
- Because!

01:38.087 --> 01:41.125
- I-I need it for...
- It's just for breakfast.

01:42.858 --> 01:46.061
Hey babe!
Good morning.

01:46.063 --> 01:49.700
I was, uh, trying to make
breakfast for my husband.

01:51.101 --> 01:52.769
Good work.

01:56.607 --> 01:58.909
I'm trying, Jackson.

02:01.979 --> 02:03.714
And I love you.

02:05.682 --> 02:07.952
Hey, look,
we need to talk.

02:09.987 --> 02:11.686
About what?

02:11.688 --> 02:13.624
We can talk
about it later.

02:15.659 --> 02:16.925
Check your eggs.

02:16.927 --> 02:18.759
Come on, sweetie,
let's go. School time.

02:18.761 --> 02:20.328
- And I'm eating this orange.
- No!

02:20.330 --> 02:22.129
- Come on.
- No.

02:22.131 --> 02:24.699
Let me hold the orange.
I'm gonna give it back.

02:24.701 --> 02:26.401
- No.
- I'll give you back half of it.

02:26.403 --> 02:28.806
- No.
- Why not?

02:43.820 --> 02:45.152
Damn.

02:45.154 --> 02:47.421
Oh, baby.

02:47.423 --> 02:49.893
Oh, I love you.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.997
Damn.

03:02.439 --> 03:05.105
Mm, I love you.

03:05.107 --> 03:06.373
I love you, too.

03:09.679 --> 03:11.445
Baby, I asked you
to get me up at 7 AM,

03:11.447 --> 03:13.048
not for you to get up too.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.217
I had to. I wanted to get some
before you left.

03:16.219 --> 03:19.420
Plus, I needed to get up early
so I can get some writing done

03:19.422 --> 03:22.456
before I go hang out
with the girls.

03:22.458 --> 03:26.760
Me and my boys, we're about to
catch a gang of fish today.

03:26.762 --> 03:28.263
Yeah.

03:28.265 --> 03:30.865
Y'all better get back, 'cause
I'm telling you right now,

03:30.867 --> 03:32.967
- I ain't saving no plates.
- You better save me a plate.

03:32.969 --> 03:34.102
You better save me a plate.

03:34.104 --> 03:35.770
I ain't saving...
You get back here.

03:35.772 --> 03:37.072
- Don't play.
- You get back here.

03:37.074 --> 03:40.074
I will. I promise.
I ain't missin' any fish.

03:40.076 --> 03:43.912
So look.
I've started my practice.

03:43.914 --> 03:45.847
- Mm-hmm.
- And my baby,

03:45.849 --> 03:49.783
she's about to be
a best-selling author, novelist.

03:49.785 --> 03:52.319
Right, yeah right.

03:52.321 --> 03:54.723
I wanna have a family.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.927
I wanna start a family.

03:58.761 --> 04:01.162
You know,
when I finish my book,

04:01.164 --> 04:06.467
and I get an editor,
and get published...

04:06.469 --> 04:09.804
it's a lot on a sister's plate.

04:09.806 --> 04:12.173
Just... be patient with me,
Dr. Livewell.

04:12.175 --> 04:16.076
I just need a little more time
before we start having

04:16.077 --> 04:19.047
a bunch of crumb-snatchers
running around here.

04:19.048 --> 04:20.848
Baby, you've been working
on that book

04:20.850 --> 04:21.915
for two years, all right?

04:21.916 --> 04:23.518
It's my first novel!

04:23.520 --> 04:25.920
Masterpieces take time.

04:25.922 --> 04:27.788
- What?
- Okay.

04:27.790 --> 04:30.091
Hey. What?
No, mm-mm.

04:30.093 --> 04:32.060
I'm not done with you yet.
Where are you going?

04:32.062 --> 04:33.827
What you mean,
you ain't done with me?

04:33.829 --> 04:35.797
Where you going?

04:35.799 --> 04:38.466
- It's the encore.
- Is this fair?

04:38.468 --> 04:40.769
No.
Is this fair?

04:40.771 --> 04:43.838
Is this fair?

04:43.840 --> 04:45.773
I'm serious.
I want a family.

04:45.775 --> 04:47.542
No peeks.

04:47.544 --> 04:49.444
Baby.

04:53.415 --> 04:54.884
Okay.

05:23.847 --> 05:27.084
Good morning, Bishop.

05:47.571 --> 05:49.907
Have a good day.

05:59.549 --> 06:01.315
Oh! Hello?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.384
Aria, girl,
you are not going to believe

06:03.386 --> 06:05.420
what your crazy ass
Uncle Junebug did.

06:05.422 --> 06:07.988
That fool done went out
and got another tramp pregnant.

06:07.990 --> 06:11.391
<i>Baby mama number five,
Lord Jesus, oh.</i>

06:11.393 --> 06:13.595
I'm working, Mom.

06:13.597 --> 06:15.863
Well, that's your problem,
not mine.

06:15.865 --> 06:17.564
Girl, you married a doctor.

06:17.566 --> 06:19.399
Why are you working anyway?

06:19.401 --> 06:21.870
I'm a writer.
I'm writing.

06:21.872 --> 06:23.071
That's what writers do.

06:23.073 --> 06:26.040
Yeah, but you ain't sold
nary book.

06:26.042 --> 06:27.141
<i>But you know what?</i>

06:27.143 --> 06:28.343
<i>When you finish that thing,</i>

06:28.345 --> 06:31.011
I'm gonna buy
the first 10 copies,

06:31.013 --> 06:33.648
and I want them all autographed
by my baby girl.

06:33.650 --> 06:36.516
Bye, Mama.

06:36.518 --> 06:38.418
This woman.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.857
Oh, crap.

06:42.391 --> 06:45.660
Okay.

06:45.662 --> 06:47.160
I think you should
lead the toast.

06:47.162 --> 06:49.096
- Uh-uh, why me?
- Because if Jamie does it,

06:49.098 --> 06:50.632
we'll be here all day
with her prayer.

06:50.634 --> 06:52.233
There's always
a good time for prayer.

06:52.235 --> 06:54.134
Amen to that.
So, we're gonna take this time

06:54.136 --> 06:57.071
to do a toast to my ladies,
whom I love,

06:57.073 --> 06:59.173
and I'm so happy that we do this
every single Friday,

06:59.175 --> 07:01.009
'cause it is Ladies' Friday.

07:01.011 --> 07:02.276
- Yes.
- Hear, hear.

07:02.278 --> 07:04.245
It's bad luck to toast
with water, Jamie.

07:04.247 --> 07:05.312
Yes, it is.

07:05.314 --> 07:06.146
Mm, mm, mm-hmm.

07:06.148 --> 07:08.415
So refreshing,
so good for the body.

07:08.417 --> 07:11.319
Mm, mm, mm-mm.

07:11.321 --> 07:13.922
- Tap out. You win.
- Where's Jessa?

07:13.924 --> 07:15.122
She's two hours late.

07:15.124 --> 07:16.624
No, no, she's not coming.

07:16.626 --> 07:19.127
- She mentioned she had something else to do.
- What?

07:19.129 --> 07:21.528
What does she have to do
where she can't be here?

07:21.530 --> 07:23.497
It's not like she has
other friends, or a man.

07:23.499 --> 07:27.634
Mm, actually, she mentioned
she was seeing somebody new!

07:27.636 --> 07:29.036
- What?
- Yeah!

07:29.038 --> 07:31.406
Okay, no, no, no,
please share details!

07:31.408 --> 07:32.439
Well, um...

07:34.576 --> 07:36.043
What in God's name is that?

07:36.045 --> 07:37.711
Oh, come on, you can't start
and not finish.

07:37.713 --> 07:39.480
- Do you know about this guy?
- Mm-mm.

07:39.482 --> 07:42.216
I know sometimes I work late
at the office, but seriously?

07:42.218 --> 07:44.418
- You've never seen this guy?
- Mm-mm. I don't know.

07:45.388 --> 07:47.655
Seeing somebody,
'cause I've been telling her

07:47.657 --> 07:50.223
for the longest...

07:50.225 --> 07:51.059
Uh, Renee?

07:51.061 --> 07:53.360
Sweet Jesus, Lord.

07:53.362 --> 07:54.295
- Uh, Renee?
- Hmm?

07:54.297 --> 07:56.430
This sexy piece of caramel
was at the door

07:56.432 --> 07:58.167
asking for you.

08:00.270 --> 08:02.103
Come on, baby,
take it off.

08:02.105 --> 08:04.172
Listen, y'all are
some thirsty hoes.

08:04.174 --> 08:05.740
This is my assistant, Darren.

08:05.742 --> 08:07.675
Did you just use
that language?

08:07.677 --> 08:10.177
- Sorry, Darren.
- It's okay, Mrs. Clinton.

08:10.179 --> 08:11.713
Here are those files
you requested.

08:11.715 --> 08:13.180
Oh, yes. Thank you.

08:13.182 --> 08:15.048
Of course.
Now, if you need anything else,

08:15.050 --> 08:16.451
feel free
to just give me a call.

08:16.453 --> 08:19.052
- I'll be back at the office.
- Okay, thank you Darren.

08:19.054 --> 08:20.153
- No problem.
- Okay.

08:20.155 --> 08:21.456
- All right.
- I'll walk you out.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.458
No problem,
I can show myself out.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.225
- Oh, okay.
- Ladies.

08:25.227 --> 08:26.326
Thank you.

08:26.328 --> 08:28.428
Bye, Darren!

08:28.430 --> 08:29.463
Dang, Renee.

08:29.465 --> 08:33.368
Now I see why you spend
so many hours at work!

08:33.370 --> 08:36.203
Okay, y'all have some issues.
Stop it! Come on...

08:36.205 --> 08:38.373
I am a happily married woman,
thank you.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.374
Mm-hmm.

08:39.376 --> 08:41.009
And that boy
is way too young.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.210
He's still wet
behind the ears.

08:42.212 --> 08:44.278
He probably
still wears Underoos.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.746
So true.

08:45.748 --> 08:47.081
You're married,
not dead.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.383
As long as
you don't do anything,

08:48.385 --> 08:50.751
there's nothing wrong
with admiring God's creations.

08:50.753 --> 08:53.388
Hear, hear.
I would admire that erry day.

08:53.390 --> 08:54.489
Wow, so vulgar.

08:54.491 --> 08:56.657
I can't deal with
y'all chicks today.

08:58.093 --> 08:59.659
Oh no-no-no,
no, no, sit. You sit.

08:59.661 --> 09:02.230
Darren probably came back
'cause he forgot something.

09:02.232 --> 09:04.499
I don't want y'all two broads
salivating over him again.

09:04.501 --> 09:06.134
- I'm just getting a napkin.
- No.

09:06.136 --> 09:08.101
You really need to get
a proper doorbell, Aria.

09:08.103 --> 09:10.370
And you really need to stop
eating cupcakes, Jamie.

09:10.372 --> 09:11.639
I'm serious.

09:11.641 --> 09:14.775
You can go from the chick with
the fat ass to the fatass chick.

09:14.777 --> 09:16.110
Watch.

09:16.112 --> 09:18.712
Whoo-hoo! Ooh.

09:18.714 --> 09:20.313
Special delivery!

09:20.315 --> 09:22.616
Mm!

09:22.618 --> 09:23.650
Really?

09:23.652 --> 09:25.119
Wow. Really, Renee?

09:25.121 --> 09:26.421
Those are gorgeous.

09:26.423 --> 09:28.755
- Hmm!
- Well, would you come open it?

09:28.757 --> 09:30.191
Oh!
I thought they were for you.

09:30.193 --> 09:32.192
I thought that was
your assistant, huh?

09:32.194 --> 09:33.794
Okay, no, Darren
did not bring me these.

09:33.796 --> 09:35.263
They were already
out on your porch

09:35.265 --> 09:37.065
when I went out there,
so I assume

09:37.067 --> 09:38.499
they are
for the lady of the house.

09:38.501 --> 09:39.667
- Moi?
- Yes,

09:39.669 --> 09:41.369
would you hurry up
and open it?

09:41.371 --> 09:44.272
Look at Kingston over here,
flexing his romantic muscles.

09:44.274 --> 09:47.274
- It's "to her."
- A DVD? Really?

09:47.276 --> 09:49.143
Let me find out
that you and Kingston

09:49.145 --> 09:51.144
did a "Mimi and Nico"
fake sex tape?

09:51.146 --> 09:52.813
Really? That's what
we're about to watch?

09:52.815 --> 09:56.350
Girl, bye.

09:56.352 --> 09:59.419
Oh, okay.
Actually, it says "to her,"

09:59.421 --> 10:01.221
and Bishop Eric
does know I'm here,

10:01.223 --> 10:02.823
so the flowers
are probably for me.

10:02.825 --> 10:05.293
You know, no, no, no,
Jamie has a point.

10:05.295 --> 10:07.161
'Cause Jackson knows
I'm over here, too.

10:07.163 --> 10:08.528
So how do we know
this is not for me?

10:08.530 --> 10:10.664
Well, there's only one way
to find out, ladies.

10:10.666 --> 10:15.602
Cough it up. Give it!
I'll play it, 'Nee.

10:15.604 --> 10:17.206
My sweet husband.

10:18.174 --> 10:22.809
<i>Surprise! It's me.</i>

10:22.811 --> 10:25.613
<i>This message is for her.</i>

10:25.615 --> 10:28.182
<i>I knew where to find you,
because it's girls' night,</i>

10:28.184 --> 10:30.418
<i>where we hang with the clique.</i>

10:30.420 --> 10:33.187
<i>As you know, I won't be
attending the festivities</i>

10:33.189 --> 10:35.355
<i>this go 'round.</i>

10:35.357 --> 10:38.359
Or, ever again,
for that matter.

10:38.361 --> 10:42.196
There are many forks
in the road in life,

10:42.198 --> 10:45.466
and I decided to travel
down the path

10:45.468 --> 10:50.804
leading straight into
your husband's open arms.

10:50.806 --> 10:54.442
<i>Yes, your husband.</i>

10:54.444 --> 10:57.912
I can't lie,
and say I regret it.

10:57.914 --> 11:00.214
I need him more than you do,

11:00.216 --> 11:03.350
and I love him
more than you ever will.

11:03.352 --> 11:06.854
<i>This morning?
You saw him.</i>

11:06.856 --> 11:08.923
<i>For the last time.</i>

11:08.925 --> 11:14.394
Tonight, he comes home to me.

11:14.396 --> 11:19.366
He's my man now.
Thank you.

11:19.368 --> 11:23.370
<i>Thank you for not being
woman enough for him.</i>

11:23.372 --> 11:25.873
<i>I am twice the woman you are.</i>

11:25.875 --> 11:29.744
<i>As a matter of fact,
he whispered that in my ear</i>

11:29.746 --> 11:33.380
<i>just a few weeks ago
in your bed.</i>

11:33.382 --> 11:37.485
I mean, if you
have yet to figure it out,

11:37.487 --> 11:40.388
you most definitely will.

11:40.390 --> 11:41.688
Tonight.

11:41.690 --> 11:43.256
When you're sleeping alone,

11:43.258 --> 11:46.529
and your husband's arms
are wrapped around me.

11:48.264 --> 11:50.234
Bye bye, now.

11:51.467 --> 11:55.436
- What the f...?
- Oh my God.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.804
Does she think this is funny?

11:57.806 --> 11:59.609
This is not funny.

12:05.781 --> 12:08.416
Sorry, ladies.

12:08.418 --> 12:10.250
It's just that Jessa's
little silly game

12:10.252 --> 12:12.887
- made me just lose my brunch.
- Right.

12:12.889 --> 12:14.554
Oh, gosh.

12:14.556 --> 12:16.389
Did you get Jessa
on the phone?

12:16.391 --> 12:18.525
Do you hear me talking
on the phone to anybody, Jamie?

12:18.527 --> 12:19.994
Obviously the bitch
didn't pick up.

12:19.996 --> 12:22.263
All right,
this is all bad.

12:22.265 --> 12:23.530
Jessa,
this is Aria.

12:23.532 --> 12:27.000
We got your little DVD message.
Be woman enough to call us back.

12:27.002 --> 12:28.568
Matter of fact,
be woman enough

12:28.570 --> 12:30.403
to bring your raggedy behind
down here.

12:30.405 --> 12:31.972
You know where we are.

12:31.974 --> 12:36.277
Slut... tramp.. whore.

12:36.279 --> 12:37.677
Kingston's not answering
the phone.

12:37.679 --> 12:39.547
All right, fine,
let me call,

12:39.549 --> 12:41.481
see if Jackson
will answer his cell.

12:41.483 --> 12:42.716
Hold on.

12:45.788 --> 12:48.589
Jackson's cell's gone straight
to voicemail, too.

12:48.591 --> 12:50.624
The point is, she can only leave

12:50.626 --> 12:52.759
- with one of our husbands, right?
- Right.

12:52.761 --> 12:54.894
So you said that you met up
with Jessa the other week,

12:54.896 --> 12:57.298
and she mentioned she started
seeing somebody, so...

12:57.300 --> 13:00.868
Yeah, we had
lunch about four Fridays ago.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.940
Damn. They don't make
'em like that anymore.

13:05.942 --> 13:08.609
- Hey!
- Oh! Hey, boo!

13:09.811 --> 13:14.414
Oh, you know what, I am so glad
you chose Uncle Andre's.

13:14.416 --> 13:16.049
You know it's
my favorite spot, right?

13:16.051 --> 13:19.019
Uh-uh.
Girl, you are glowing.

13:19.021 --> 13:20.620
Did you get some
last night?

13:20.622 --> 13:24.892
Um, I'm really trying to
figure out what I'm gonna eat.

13:24.894 --> 13:29.029
So you are seeing someone!

13:29.031 --> 13:30.764
Yeah!

13:30.766 --> 13:33.634
I'm... no, not per se.

13:33.636 --> 13:38.706
Not necessarily seeing anyone
like that.

13:38.708 --> 13:43.510
Okay, Aria, yes,
I am seeing someone.

13:43.512 --> 13:46.681
Jessa, you don't have to
feel guilty about moving on.

13:46.683 --> 13:48.916
It's been some time,
so many years,

13:48.918 --> 13:50.384
since Mark passed away, okay?

13:50.386 --> 13:51.786
You deserve to move on
with your life.

13:51.788 --> 13:53.620
At some point, you have to.
All right?

13:53.622 --> 13:58.958
You deserve loved up, loved on,
again, and again, and again.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.796
So...?
When do we get to meet him?

14:01.798 --> 14:02.897
Um...

14:02.899 --> 14:05.899
Wow. We're taking things
super... super-duper slow.

14:05.901 --> 14:08.969
So, meeting friends
and family and all that

14:08.971 --> 14:10.538
that's probably
not gonna happen.

14:10.540 --> 14:11.639
Not any time soon.

14:11.641 --> 14:12.972
You gotta give
me something.

14:12.974 --> 14:14.475
I mean, like,
where's he from?

14:14.477 --> 14:16.009
- The peach cobbler...
- Does he have any kids?

14:16.011 --> 14:18.578
- What tax bracket is he in?
- The peach cobbler is awesome.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.681
Social security?
What does he look like?

14:20.683 --> 14:22.549
- I mean...
- Okay, Curious Georgette.

14:22.551 --> 14:24.652
He looks...

14:24.654 --> 14:26.419
handsome.

14:26.421 --> 14:27.554
And, we, uh...

14:27.556 --> 14:29.423
we met through a, um...

14:29.425 --> 14:31.124
mutual friend.

14:31.126 --> 14:32.426
Okay!

14:32.428 --> 14:35.629
Uh-huh.
Let's go, ladies.

14:35.631 --> 14:37.465
We need to get to the bottom
of this hot mess

14:37.467 --> 14:39.602
and pay Miss Jessa Bell
a visit.

14:45.474 --> 14:47.877
Come on. Come on.

14:51.981 --> 14:54.581
The one who sleeps alone
tonight.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.751
So alone. She'll know.

14:57.753 --> 14:59.855
She'll know
that I'm the better woman.

15:01.991 --> 15:03.758
Mm.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.461
Oh, hell, I wish he would have
skipped that damn fishing trip.

15:08.463 --> 15:11.865
I mean, really.

15:11.867 --> 15:16.339
I've got all the red snapper
he needs right here.

15:33.823 --> 15:36.360
Welcome to the
whorehouse, ladies.

15:37.593 --> 15:38.325
Wow.

15:38.327 --> 15:41.431
Yo, this just
got way real.

15:42.698 --> 15:45.501
- Where are you going?
- Looking for clues.

15:48.438 --> 15:50.870
There isn't anything here.

15:50.872 --> 15:54.508
I should have known better
than to trust that slut.

15:54.510 --> 15:56.943
I did her English paper
freshman year!

15:56.945 --> 15:58.778
I should have known better

15:58.780 --> 16:02.482
than to trust anything that pees
sitting down around my husband.

16:02.484 --> 16:03.951
I'm married
to a fine ass doctor.

16:03.953 --> 16:08.188
Broads always trying to come up.
I gotta protect what's mine!

16:08.190 --> 16:10.691
Who would have known

16:10.693 --> 16:13.929
I had to be on high alert
around my friend.

16:15.564 --> 16:17.465
Yeah.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.731
We were always
so competitive,

16:18.733 --> 16:22.638
but to think she'd go
after my husband!

16:24.674 --> 16:28.475
I remember when I first
introduced him to her punk ass.

16:28.477 --> 16:34.048
Jessa, meet the love of my life
and the changer of my last name.

16:34.050 --> 16:37.485
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Dr. Livewell.

16:37.487 --> 16:39.753
I hope you live up
to your surname,

16:39.755 --> 16:41.589
for Aria's sake,
of course.

16:41.591 --> 16:43.626
It was nice
to meet you, Jessa.

16:46.127 --> 16:48.095
I'm gonna let
your girlfriend handle

16:48.097 --> 16:49.496
that whole thing
you just said.

16:49.498 --> 16:50.865
Well, you know,
I'll have you know

16:50.867 --> 16:53.667
that you just made yourself
a new friend, Kingston.

16:53.669 --> 16:55.134
Okay, well,
any friend of Aria's

16:55.136 --> 16:57.804
is a friend of mine, so...

16:57.806 --> 16:59.572
Um, you know what,
I need you two

16:59.574 --> 17:01.875
to put on some grown-up clothes,
get cleaned up.

17:01.877 --> 17:03.644
We taking you out.

17:03.646 --> 17:05.112
Who's we?
You got a boo?

17:05.114 --> 17:06.614
Girl, no.

17:06.616 --> 17:08.615
Me and two other couples
from the neighborhood.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.017
We're just...
treating you to dinner,

17:10.019 --> 17:13.086
like a welcome
to the neighborhood thing. Yeah!

17:13.088 --> 17:15.655
Jamie and Renee, actually.
You're gonna love them.

17:15.656 --> 17:18.192
- All right.
- Free food! I'm in.

17:18.194 --> 17:20.594
- I'll get a shower.
- All he needed to hear.

17:20.596 --> 17:21.729
It's like he won the lottery.

17:21.731 --> 17:23.800
I felt... Babe, seriously?

17:28.037 --> 17:30.703
I like him.

17:30.705 --> 17:32.605
- You do?
- You did, girl.

17:32.607 --> 17:35.675
Thinking back on it,

17:35.677 --> 17:38.581
this is most likely
when Jessa planned her attack.

17:40.148 --> 17:41.917
So what are
you saying, Aria?

17:44.787 --> 17:45.889
It's me.

17:47.290 --> 17:50.057
I know it's me.

18:22.758 --> 18:25.058
Trying to play me.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.829
Is he serious?

18:28.864 --> 18:30.064
Hey, baby!

18:30.066 --> 18:31.798
What's up!

18:31.800 --> 18:33.933
Where have you been?
Our song is playing!

18:33.935 --> 18:36.303
Oh, are you missing
your big daddy?

18:36.305 --> 18:39.707
- Where have you been?
- Store run.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.075
Did you leave the stuff
in the car?

18:41.077 --> 18:42.809
'Cause you came in here
empty handed.

18:42.811 --> 18:46.880
No, your mom sent me to
the store for a deck of cards.

18:46.882 --> 18:48.949
Mm-hmm?

18:48.951 --> 18:50.884
Baby, I think
you should talk to Jessa.

18:50.886 --> 18:52.019
Why?

18:52.021 --> 18:54.688
'Cause, I came out front,
and she had her head down,

18:54.690 --> 18:57.991
so I told her to take a ride
with me to the store.

19:01.364 --> 19:02.933
Kiss your wife.

19:05.033 --> 19:06.767
Give me the cards.

19:06.769 --> 19:08.836
- You'll need your hands.
- Really?

19:08.838 --> 19:10.703
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, baby?

19:10.705 --> 19:12.772
Okay, look, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:12.774 --> 19:16.676
- Grab my hair.
- People are gonna see us.

19:16.678 --> 19:18.647
Oh my...

19:20.316 --> 19:21.682
Okay...

19:21.684 --> 19:22.982
All right...

19:22.984 --> 19:25.118
Wait, I don't
understand why

19:25.120 --> 19:29.390
you had to give
Kingston oral sex.

19:29.392 --> 19:32.058
Wanted to see
if he smelled like soap.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.161
Like he cleaned up.

19:34.163 --> 19:37.030
Or if he smelled like Jessa.

19:37.032 --> 19:38.231
And?

19:38.233 --> 19:42.803
He smelled like neither.
So it was a reward.

19:42.805 --> 19:44.070
To remind him

19:44.072 --> 19:48.241
that he was being
taken care of at home.

19:48.243 --> 19:49.410
So...

19:49.412 --> 19:52.246
if he wouldn't
mess with her then,

19:52.248 --> 19:54.682
what makes you think
he's messing with her now?

19:54.684 --> 19:56.349
I don't know.
Maybe they bonded

19:56.351 --> 19:59.019
while they were on their way
to the store alone.

19:59.021 --> 20:01.821
Or maybe your mind is just
playing tricks on you.

20:01.823 --> 20:04.357
Or maybe her woman's intuition
is telling her

20:04.359 --> 20:07.894
that something is going on
between Kingston and Jessa.

20:07.896 --> 20:12.066
I could hurt
Jessa so bad right now.

20:12.068 --> 20:13.366
I'm so serious.

20:13.368 --> 20:15.836
Now, now, now.
He is your husband.

20:15.838 --> 20:17.371
It takes two to tango.

20:17.373 --> 20:21.709
Yo, if you don't shut
your bougie, delusional ass.

20:21.711 --> 20:23.042
God.

20:23.044 --> 20:25.078
Hand me the bottle, 'Nee.
Might as well get faded

20:25.080 --> 20:26.946
while we're trying
to figure out which one

20:26.948 --> 20:29.782
- of our marriages is over.
- That is not funny, Aria.

20:29.784 --> 20:31.852
Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

20:31.854 --> 20:35.189
So, so, if we just pretend Jessa
didn't drop a bombshell

20:35.191 --> 20:37.990
in all of our laps,
it'll go away?

20:37.992 --> 20:39.460
You know, I'm sorry, ladies.

20:39.462 --> 20:42.061
I gave it a lot of thought,
and I took it into prayer,

20:42.063 --> 20:44.932
and it's absolutely not
Bishop Eric.

20:44.934 --> 20:48.234
We don't believe you.
You need more people.

20:48.236 --> 20:50.503
Okay.

20:50.505 --> 20:52.205
Stop. Okay?

20:52.207 --> 20:54.441
We cannot start turning
against each other,

20:54.443 --> 20:56.844
because it's none
of our faults.

20:56.846 --> 20:59.049
And did you just
quote Jay Z?

21:03.985 --> 21:08.087
Jamie, you're right.
It's not Eric.

21:08.089 --> 21:10.490
It's not Kingston,
either, Aria.

21:10.492 --> 21:12.326
How do you know?

21:12.328 --> 21:14.731
'Cause it's Jackson.

21:16.799 --> 21:18.097
He told me this morning.

21:18.099 --> 21:21.201
Oh, Renee.
I am so sorry.

21:21.203 --> 21:23.369
No, wait,
he just walked up on you

21:23.371 --> 21:25.905
and told you he's having...
he's sleeping with Jessa?

21:25.907 --> 21:29.244
This morning I told Jackson
that I love him.

21:31.113 --> 21:34.515
He replied,
"We need to talk."

21:34.517 --> 21:36.016
But that doesn't mean anything.

21:36.018 --> 21:37.851
It could be like you told me,
you know,

21:37.853 --> 21:39.853
your mind could just be
playing tricks on you.

21:39.855 --> 21:41.121
He could want to
talk to you about

21:41.123 --> 21:42.955
millions of different things.

21:42.957 --> 21:44.893
Jackson is fed up
with me working.

21:47.128 --> 21:50.099
I mean, come on, guys,
we don't need the money.

21:52.835 --> 21:54.938
It was my choice.

21:57.306 --> 21:58.571
I started going back to work

21:58.573 --> 22:00.843
because I needed to be
fulfilled.

22:03.011 --> 22:06.046
I mean, you don't understand
wh-when the...

22:06.048 --> 22:07.580
when the kids started
going to school,

22:07.582 --> 22:09.549
staying at home all day?

22:09.551 --> 22:11.551
Washing and cleaning?

22:11.553 --> 22:14.086
Come on, that got old!

22:14.088 --> 22:17.391
I'm a college-educated woman!

22:17.393 --> 22:19.926
I never thought
that my career w-would...

22:19.928 --> 22:22.264
would jeopardize my marriage!

22:24.200 --> 22:29.036
One night Jackson invited
all of his colleagues

22:29.038 --> 22:32.471
to our house for dinner, and...

22:32.473 --> 22:35.576
You know, I was
up against a deadline

22:35.578 --> 22:38.047
for a marketing proposal.

22:40.081 --> 22:43.118
I asked Jessa to help out.

22:46.021 --> 22:48.087
- That's crazy.
- Do you remember that?

22:48.089 --> 22:50.958
I do. I do.
I totally forgot about that.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.124
- Wow.
- Goodness, yeah.

22:52.126 --> 22:54.193
- That was hilarious.
- How did that...

22:54.195 --> 22:56.195
- Good times.
- Yeah, yeah, no.

22:56.197 --> 22:59.031
But listen, hey, I appreciate
you coming over to help.

22:59.033 --> 23:00.299
- I really do.
- Oh, Jackson.

23:00.301 --> 23:02.102
I mean, look at this place.
I couldn't...

23:02.104 --> 23:03.636
there's no way
I could have done this.

23:03.638 --> 23:05.404
Oh, please! It's fine!

23:05.406 --> 23:09.078
I love to help.

23:10.980 --> 23:14.146
Hey. I'm home.

23:14.148 --> 23:15.318
Hi!

23:20.556 --> 23:22.256
- Hey, Jessa.
- Hey.

23:22.258 --> 23:25.328
Yeah. Hi, baby!

23:28.998 --> 23:32.065
Well, since you are back,
I'm gonna...

23:32.067 --> 23:34.134
I guess I'm gonna
head home.

23:34.136 --> 23:36.536
Thank you for everything,
Jessa.

23:36.538 --> 23:37.971
I didn't do anything.

23:37.973 --> 23:40.106
You had everything
planned perfectly.

23:40.108 --> 23:42.375
The caterers are in
the kitchen throwing down.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.979
I had some of the samples.
Delicious.

23:45.981 --> 23:47.547
Dropped the kids off
at your mom's,

23:47.549 --> 23:49.615
and the table's set.

23:49.617 --> 23:51.518
Everything's good to go.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.857
Thank you.

24:02.530 --> 24:06.165
Jackson, I am sorry that
I couldn't be here tonight.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.271
Couldn't, or wouldn't?

24:10.271 --> 24:13.039
Why do you keep
fighting me about my work?

24:13.041 --> 24:15.374
You know that I am
the vice president of marketing

24:15.376 --> 24:17.044
for a Fortune 500 company,

24:17.046 --> 24:19.078
which entails
a lot of responsibility,

24:19.080 --> 24:21.384
- a lot of hours...
- And so does being a wife!

24:22.684 --> 24:24.284
So, you...

24:24.286 --> 24:26.686
You're completely comfortable
asking another woman

24:26.688 --> 24:27.954
to do your wifely duties?

24:27.956 --> 24:29.221
Wifely duties?

24:29.223 --> 24:31.057
Look, Jackson,
let me tell you something.

24:31.059 --> 24:33.026
I know that I work,
but I am still...

24:33.028 --> 24:35.198
I'm sorry, I'm looking
for Mrs. Clinton?

24:36.464 --> 24:37.663
Yes, how can I help you?

24:37.665 --> 24:41.468
Um...
the other Mrs. Clinton?

24:44.405 --> 24:46.073
I am Mrs. Clinton.

24:46.075 --> 24:48.444
I am the one and only
Mrs. Clinton.

24:49.712 --> 24:52.147
What can I
help you with, honey?

25:04.326 --> 25:06.393
Do either of you have
the boating information?

25:06.395 --> 25:09.528
I'm sure we can reach them
in case of emergency.

25:09.530 --> 25:11.999
And say what, huh?

25:12.001 --> 25:13.467
Oh, we should call
them and say,

25:13.469 --> 25:15.201
"Excuse me,
can I talk to the captain?

25:15.203 --> 25:17.037
"Can you please ask
the three gentlemen,

25:17.039 --> 25:19.205
"'which one of you
is a no-good cheating husband

25:19.207 --> 25:22.209
who's not coming home
to his wife tonight?'"

25:27.750 --> 25:29.615
Now, what are you doing?

25:29.617 --> 25:31.287
I'm texting Jessa.

25:32.421 --> 25:34.488
She won't respond
to any of our calls.

25:34.490 --> 25:36.789
Maybe she'll just...

25:36.791 --> 25:39.462
I mean, maybe she'll
answer my text.

25:47.336 --> 25:50.473
Hello, Bishop.
What are you doing?

25:51.740 --> 25:53.376
Jessa's?

25:55.411 --> 25:57.076
Oh.

25:57.078 --> 25:59.147
Fixing her blinds, I see.

26:00.382 --> 26:03.186
Last week it was
her garbage disposal.

26:05.287 --> 26:07.520
I... I know that Mark
is no longer here,

26:07.522 --> 26:10.289
and you guys
have been friends for...

26:10.291 --> 26:13.125
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course not.

26:13.127 --> 26:16.229
I don't want you to stop
everything and come home.

26:16.231 --> 26:18.097
I... I'm just here,

26:18.099 --> 26:22.803
just studying
Mark 12 through 14.

26:22.805 --> 26:26.309
All right.
All right, baby.

26:36.684 --> 26:38.384
Oh, hey.

26:38.386 --> 26:39.653
Hi Jessa.

26:39.655 --> 26:41.555
Girl, I...

26:41.557 --> 26:43.589
I had to borrow
your husband, again.

26:43.591 --> 26:45.826
You know I'm revamping
the entire house, right?

26:45.828 --> 26:47.294
Including the drapes.

26:47.296 --> 26:50.730
So, we're just in here
interior decorating.

26:50.732 --> 26:52.432
Oh, hey babe!

26:52.434 --> 26:54.101
Oh.

26:54.103 --> 26:56.303
Not only does my husband
know the Word,

26:56.305 --> 26:59.306
apparently
he's an interior decorator.

27:02.344 --> 27:04.478
Actually, I thought
I'd come by and lend a hand

27:04.480 --> 27:07.279
since I was at home
doing nothing.

27:07.281 --> 27:10.749
Oh. Well, by all means,
the more the merrier.

27:10.751 --> 27:12.853
- Come on in.
- Oh, glory be.

27:12.855 --> 27:16.123
- Glory be.
- You look fantastic.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.726
Oh, Renee. Don't cry.

27:19.728 --> 27:21.127
I know it's difficult,

27:21.129 --> 27:23.296
but I don't think
you need to worry.

27:23.298 --> 27:25.265
After listening
to both of you,

27:25.267 --> 27:27.500
I'm pretty certain
that it's Kingston.

27:27.502 --> 27:30.569
Bitch, please.
You got the same message we did.

27:30.571 --> 27:32.271
I am a first lady.

27:32.273 --> 27:34.740
Do not refer to me
with such vulgarity.

27:34.742 --> 27:36.476
Uh-huh.
I call it like I see it.

27:36.478 --> 27:37.743
So do I.

27:37.745 --> 27:38.878
Stop it!

27:38.880 --> 27:41.615
The three of us
are still best friends!

27:41.617 --> 27:43.616
We cannot let Jessa...

27:43.618 --> 27:46.088
She can't turn us
against each other!

27:47.789 --> 27:49.756
I'm sorry. You're right.

27:49.758 --> 27:51.525
I'm sorry for
calling you out your name,

27:51.527 --> 27:54.097
and wanting to slap
the taste out your mouth.

27:55.731 --> 27:57.631
Apology accepted.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.332
Well, I need a shower,

27:59.334 --> 28:02.301
and I'm over
this abandoned house.

28:02.303 --> 28:03.803
Can we please
go home?

28:03.805 --> 28:05.508
- Yes.
- Yes.

28:10.345 --> 28:12.612
Come on,
sassy first lady.

28:12.614 --> 28:13.880
Stop it.

29:46.607 --> 29:49.342
Hey, lover.

29:49.344 --> 29:51.611
I'm home.

29:51.613 --> 29:54.881
The movers are all gone,
and I'm just...

29:54.883 --> 29:58.718
I'm just here, all alone,

29:58.720 --> 30:01.820
just thinking about you,

30:01.822 --> 30:04.024
waiting on you,

30:04.026 --> 30:06.660
waiting to feel you
inside of me.

30:08.930 --> 30:11.330
Tonight, lover.

30:11.332 --> 30:16.504
Oh, tonight is all about you.

30:25.513 --> 30:30.552
Regrets? I have none.

30:31.919 --> 30:36.021
You know, when Mark died,
I thought I'd never love again,

30:36.023 --> 30:40.794
but I found life in his arms.

30:40.796 --> 30:45.365
I learned how to be again.
I learned how to breathe again.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.302
He did that for me.

30:48.936 --> 30:52.571
He did, and no one
could ever understand that.

30:52.573 --> 30:53.940
No one.

30:53.942 --> 30:57.576
I couldn't pass up the chance
to feel loved again,

30:57.578 --> 31:00.282
to feel cherished
and adored and...

31:01.950 --> 31:03.717
This is no fling.

31:03.719 --> 31:06.952
This is just
the beginning for us.

31:06.954 --> 31:09.556
Little Miss Broken-Hearted,

31:09.558 --> 31:12.424
she'll be getting
her divorce papers this week.

31:12.426 --> 31:14.693
And when she does,

31:14.695 --> 31:18.698
and everything
is legally squared away,

31:18.700 --> 31:21.437
I'll marry the man
that I love.

31:22.904 --> 31:25.904
Yeah.

31:25.906 --> 31:27.776
To my happiness.

31:28.976 --> 31:30.578
Cheers.

32:10.551 --> 32:13.685
<i>You've been coming
here once a month</i>

32:13.687 --> 32:16.425
<i>for the last five years.</i>

32:18.126 --> 32:20.727
<i>You only watch me perform,</i>

32:20.729 --> 32:25.698
and then you leave
without saying anything to me.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.504
You're one of
my biggest fans.

32:30.004 --> 32:31.773
You know what you need?

32:32.874 --> 32:35.141
- A private dance.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

32:35.143 --> 32:37.876
- You game?
- I'm married, thank you.

32:37.878 --> 32:40.880
I'm married.

32:40.882 --> 32:42.651
Let's go.

32:51.926 --> 32:55.862
Don't worry, you're in
good hands with Pleasure.

32:55.864 --> 32:57.063
Oh.

32:57.065 --> 33:04.774
So... what exactly did you mean
by private consultation?

33:10.212 --> 33:12.178
Oh, my.

33:35.569 --> 33:37.839
<i>Front door open.</i>

33:52.052 --> 33:53.722
Welcome home, wife.

33:56.558 --> 34:00.596
Eric, you're home early.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.735
Is there something wrong?

34:17.678 --> 34:19.779
<i>Nasty girl.</i>

34:19.781 --> 34:21.550
<i>I'm a nasty girl.</i>

34:23.851 --> 34:26.685
Eric, it's not
what you think, honey.

34:26.687 --> 34:29.288
- It's not what you...
- Shh.

34:29.290 --> 34:31.223
Are you my nasty girl?

34:31.225 --> 34:33.695
Yes, I'm your nasty girl.

34:35.728 --> 34:39.766
"Take me, my Pleasure.

34:41.202 --> 34:43.303
I'm your nasty girl."

34:47.876 --> 34:50.641
That's some message
you left me, wifey.

34:50.643 --> 34:52.245
What's my name?

34:52.246 --> 34:53.344
Pleasure...

34:59.821 --> 35:03.790
No, no, it's not what it seems.
I can explain this.

35:03.792 --> 35:05.691
- Eric, please no, please no.
- Shut up!

35:05.693 --> 35:06.825
Yes!

35:06.827 --> 35:09.328
- Okay, okay...
- Shut your mouth.

35:09.330 --> 35:10.863
Yes!

35:10.865 --> 35:14.866
I had no idea
that I married a slut.

35:14.868 --> 35:17.604
- I can't breathe.
- A no-good whore,

35:17.606 --> 35:19.805
someone that will beg
another man to...

35:19.807 --> 35:22.941
- I can't breathe...
- ...to do her like a trick?

35:22.943 --> 35:24.209
You still breathing?

35:28.850 --> 35:31.084
I hate you, Jamie.
You hear me?

35:31.086 --> 35:33.218
I don't give a damn
what happens to you

35:33.220 --> 35:34.386
from here on out.

35:34.388 --> 35:35.721
I could kill you.

35:47.968 --> 35:53.973
You've got the audacity
to walk in my house,

35:53.975 --> 35:58.377
still wet from sex
with another man.

36:00.314 --> 36:03.683
That's what you do to me,
Jamie?

36:03.685 --> 36:07.590
Baby, I love you. I'm so sorry.

36:08.423 --> 36:10.256
You love me?

36:10.258 --> 36:14.292
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- You really love me?

36:14.294 --> 36:17.930
Jamie, if you loved me...

36:17.932 --> 36:21.136
I would hate to be married
to a woman who hated me.

36:53.834 --> 36:55.801
How was your day?

36:55.803 --> 36:57.905
Everything go well
at church today?

37:08.048 --> 37:10.149
Mother came by
this afternoon.

37:10.151 --> 37:12.451
She helped me
make your favorite,

37:12.453 --> 37:14.386
red velvet cupcakes.

37:16.725 --> 37:18.957
Hmm!

37:18.959 --> 37:20.959
I almost forgot to tell you,

37:20.961 --> 37:23.930
the Martins had it out
on the lawn today.

37:23.932 --> 37:26.999
She egged his BMW
and slashed his tires.

37:27.001 --> 37:29.167
Can you believe it?
I was watching it,

37:29.169 --> 37:32.337
and I felt like I was watching
a soap opera live.

37:32.339 --> 37:36.812
It was better than one of those
Tyler Perry plays.

37:44.952 --> 37:47.255
This is ridiculous, Eric.

37:48.990 --> 37:53.258
If you're going to ignore me,
why do you come to dinner?

37:53.260 --> 37:56.162
If you're going to ignore me,
why do you come home?

37:56.164 --> 37:59.068
If you're going to ignore me,
why are we together?

38:06.975 --> 38:09.978
It's been a year
since my indiscretion.

38:13.113 --> 38:16.251
I've apologized from
the bottom of my heart.

38:18.986 --> 38:21.856
Are you ever
going to forgive me?

39:32.593 --> 39:40.968
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

39:42.970 --> 39:46.941
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

39:48.209 --> 39:50.345
on Earth as it is in heaven.

39:51.479 --> 39:56.018
Give us this day
our daily bread,

39:57.084 --> 40:00.054
and forgive us
our trespasses.

40:25.113 --> 40:27.015
Please answer.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.196
Hello?

40:43.664 --> 40:45.131
Hey, Mom.

40:45.133 --> 40:48.500
Well, don't sound so excited
to hear from me.

40:48.502 --> 40:50.136
No, I-I'm sorry.

40:50.138 --> 40:52.404
It's just I was hoping
you were Kingston.

40:52.406 --> 40:53.973
Baby, what's wrong?

40:53.975 --> 40:56.308
Oh my God, Mama.

40:56.310 --> 40:57.642
Baby, what is it?

40:57.644 --> 40:59.544
Jessa sent over
this DVD message

40:59.546 --> 41:02.214
to me, Renee and Jamie,

41:02.216 --> 41:05.984
saying she's having an affair
with one of our husbands,

41:05.986 --> 41:07.986
and he's not coming home
tonight,

41:07.988 --> 41:10.022
<i>but leaving
to be with her instead.</i>

41:10.024 --> 41:12.991
- What?
- And she was serious.

41:12.993 --> 41:14.459
Did you talk to Kingston?

41:14.461 --> 41:16.028
<i>No, I tried calling him.</i>

41:16.030 --> 41:19.031
He went on a fishing trip
with Eric and Jackson.

41:19.033 --> 41:21.033
There's no reception there

41:21.035 --> 41:22.667
and he's not coming home
until tonight.

41:22.669 --> 41:26.571
First off, that skank Jess
needs her ass whupped.

41:26.573 --> 41:28.140
She is so irrelevant right now.

41:28.142 --> 41:30.042
This is about the commitment
that was made

41:30.044 --> 41:31.444
between y'all and y'all's
husband, not her.

41:31.446 --> 41:34.580
<i>Believe it or not, it is not
about that triflin' Jess Bell.</i>

41:34.582 --> 41:38.084
This is about your marriages,
because if it wasn't her,

41:38.086 --> 41:39.451
it could have been
somebody else.

41:39.453 --> 41:42.687
You know, a faithful man
remains faithful

41:42.689 --> 41:44.622
<i>regardless of the woman
or the temptations.</i>

41:44.624 --> 41:47.593
- <i>Do you understand that, Aria?</i>
- Yes, Mom.

41:47.595 --> 41:50.428
Okay now here's the
million-dollar question for you.

41:50.430 --> 41:53.234
Do you think your husband's
cheating on you?

41:56.303 --> 41:59.337
Don't think about it,
just answer from your gut.

41:59.339 --> 42:02.540
Before the DVD message,
I would say no.

42:02.542 --> 42:07.113
But I'd also say I wouldn't put
nothing past my man.

42:07.115 --> 42:10.185
So you think Kingston
has left you?

42:14.722 --> 42:16.187
Yes.

42:16.189 --> 42:18.491
Oh, hell no.
Ariana Monique Gold,

42:18.493 --> 42:20.292
you are not crying.

42:20.294 --> 42:22.328
I just...

42:22.330 --> 42:25.131
I just don't know
what to do, Mama.

42:25.133 --> 42:26.598
<i>Baby, look,
it is really simple.</i>

42:26.600 --> 42:29.535
Either that dirty dog
does not deserve one tear

42:29.537 --> 42:32.437
shed over his corpse,
or it's not him,

42:32.439 --> 42:34.305
and you're worrying
about nothing.

42:34.307 --> 42:37.243
<i>Sweetie, in my opinion,
in a few hours,</i>

42:37.245 --> 42:39.211
<i>you're going to see
that you're just worrying</i>

42:39.213 --> 42:41.513
about a whole bunch
of nothing, okay?

42:41.515 --> 42:43.149
Kingston loves you.

42:43.151 --> 42:45.450
He adores the ground
you walk on.

42:45.452 --> 42:48.821
<i>He wouldn't cheat on you
with that heifer.</i>

42:48.823 --> 42:52.158
I pray you're right.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.129
Do you need me
to come down there?

42:55.763 --> 42:58.330
No.

42:58.332 --> 43:04.270
No, I just need some time
alone to regroup.

43:04.272 --> 43:06.372
All right, you call me back

43:06.374 --> 43:11.146
after you hear from
your husband, all right baby?

43:12.312 --> 43:14.281
<i>Call me back, okay?</i>

43:15.682 --> 43:17.518
Bye, Mama.

44:12.272 --> 44:13.671
- Okay, I'm ready.
- One, two...

44:13.673 --> 44:14.874
- Okay, wait.
- What?

44:14.876 --> 44:17.910
- Okay.
- One, two... stop laughing.

44:17.912 --> 44:20.912
- Okay, okay.
- One, two, three, cheese.

44:20.914 --> 44:23.716
- That's so sad.
- Yes, give them face.

44:23.718 --> 44:26.584
Only you would have
a doggone selfie stick.

44:26.586 --> 44:28.220
Yes, I'm leaving
this one with you.

44:28.222 --> 44:29.888
It's convenient.
You're going to love it.

44:29.890 --> 44:31.390
- I'm telling you.
- Goodie goodie.

44:31.392 --> 44:33.491
I'll take these
with my man.

44:33.493 --> 44:35.493
See, now that's entirely
too much information.

44:35.495 --> 44:38.897
- TMI?
- Too much information.

44:38.899 --> 44:41.633
It's the alcohol speaking.
Cheers.

44:41.635 --> 44:46.705
Oh, that was my freshmen year
at Columbia.

44:46.707 --> 44:48.307
Oh, I look good.

44:48.309 --> 44:50.642
- Okay, you're so humble.
- No.

44:50.644 --> 44:52.377
If I can get
into that school, girl,

44:52.379 --> 44:53.779
and turn my life around...

44:53.781 --> 44:54.913
Oh goodness,
wait a minute.

44:54.915 --> 44:57.316
We're not about
to have a Mama...

44:57.318 --> 44:59.384
we were going to have
that "Mama, I made it" moment.

44:59.386 --> 45:00.785
"I made it out
the hood, Mama."

45:00.787 --> 45:02.287
Stop.

45:02.289 --> 45:05.290
No, I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

45:05.292 --> 45:07.459
Haven't we all?

45:07.461 --> 45:14.799
Drinking, hoeing,
running credit card scams,

45:14.801 --> 45:18.305
robbing folks,
shoplifting,

45:20.207 --> 45:24.209
popping pills,
smoking weed, drinking.

45:24.211 --> 45:25.944
- Oh, we do that.
- We still do that.

45:25.946 --> 45:27.645
Yeah, I still do that.

45:28.548 --> 45:32.153
- We're good at it.
- Threesomes, foursomes.

45:33.421 --> 45:38.290
I was on the track,
when I was 15,

45:38.292 --> 45:42.294
one night,
I was walking home,

45:42.296 --> 45:46.298
and dude
pulled up beside me,

45:46.300 --> 45:50.435
offered me $200
for some head.

45:50.437 --> 45:56.274
I said, "I am not a hoe,
I am not on the track,

45:56.276 --> 45:58.612
I am walking home, okay?"

46:00.580 --> 46:02.316
Then he said,

46:04.385 --> 46:06.488
"How about $3,000?"

46:08.856 --> 46:11.390
That's a lot of money at 16.

46:11.392 --> 46:16.431
I'd never seen that much money
in my life, you know.

46:17.932 --> 46:21.433
So I said, "Sure."

46:21.435 --> 46:23.468
Do you know what he said?

46:23.470 --> 46:29.610
"Now that we have established
that you are a hoe,

46:31.044 --> 46:33.347
now we just have to negotiate."

46:35.682 --> 46:37.515
I ended up getting $500.

46:37.517 --> 46:39.420
Wow.

46:41.289 --> 46:44.790
If I knew...

46:44.792 --> 46:48.026
being so stupid...

46:48.028 --> 46:52.531
would still affect
my life today... I...

46:52.533 --> 46:53.899
Aria, don't.

46:53.901 --> 46:55.834
Okay, I mean, it's the past.

46:55.836 --> 46:59.470
I mean, it's a shady ass past,
I can't even lie,

46:59.472 --> 47:03.642
but it's
the past nonetheless.

47:03.644 --> 47:09.584
I wish life were
so simple and cute,

47:11.051 --> 47:17.459
but when you're 15
and having sex

47:18.626 --> 47:24.798
and abortion after abortion
after abortion,

47:26.667 --> 47:30.868
life has a way
of punishing you

47:30.870 --> 47:35.841
because now...

47:35.843 --> 47:40.515
now... I can't have babies.

47:42.850 --> 47:50.592
I can't give my husband
the one thing he wants from me.

47:52.359 --> 47:53.595
So I lie,

47:57.497 --> 48:00.765
because I don't have
the heart

48:00.767 --> 48:02.569
to tell him...

48:03.771 --> 48:07.908
"Hey, hubby,
I used to be a hoe."

48:09.977 --> 48:13.845
I've had a bunch of trains
ran on me

48:13.847 --> 48:20.785
and a gang of abortions and now,
I can't get pregnant.

48:24.557 --> 48:27.725
So I come up...

48:27.727 --> 48:28.896
with...

48:29.964 --> 48:34.436
excuse after excuse...

48:36.537 --> 48:39.808
as to why now...

48:42.008 --> 48:44.942
is not the best time...

48:44.944 --> 48:47.111
for me to give...

48:47.113 --> 48:49.881
m-my husband...

48:49.883 --> 48:52.353
who I love...

48:53.586 --> 48:57.358
the one thing he asks of me...

49:01.629 --> 49:06.634
a... a bab...
a baby.

49:22.615 --> 49:25.950
I started my practice,
and my baby,

49:25.952 --> 49:30.788
she about to be
a best-selling author novelist.

49:30.790 --> 49:32.558
Yeah, right.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.660
I want to have a family.

49:34.662 --> 49:36.798
I want to start a family.

49:59.185 --> 50:01.021
And I love you.

50:03.591 --> 50:05.560
Yeah, but we need
to talk.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.865
- About what?
- We can talk about it later.

50:24.245 --> 50:27.613
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

50:27.615 --> 50:29.050
<i>When you are finished
recording...</i>

50:36.624 --> 50:39.694
She's your queen.

50:41.194 --> 50:44.263
Wow, you look gorgeous.

50:44.265 --> 50:45.730
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:45.732 --> 50:48.566
I mean, it's a lot
for a school recital.

50:48.568 --> 50:50.067
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

50:50.069 --> 50:53.705
See, actually I was going to say
you look a little underdressed

50:53.707 --> 50:56.642
for my awards
banquet tonight.

50:56.644 --> 50:59.278
You're not... you're not going
to your daughter's

50:59.280 --> 51:01.613
dance recital tonight?

51:01.615 --> 51:04.082
Jackson, we already
discussed this.

51:04.084 --> 51:06.718
Getting this award is a big
accomplishment for me tonight

51:06.720 --> 51:08.921
and I want you there
by my side with me.

51:08.923 --> 51:10.689
Look as a parent,
my primary concern

51:10.691 --> 51:12.758
is for my child,
so I'll be at the recital.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.093
Look, I'd advise you
to do the same.

51:15.095 --> 51:17.930
Jackson, you and I both know
that Kieren has a recital

51:17.932 --> 51:20.999
once a month,
and I've already talked to her.

51:21.001 --> 51:22.868
She understands
that Mommy and Daddy

51:22.870 --> 51:25.837
are missing
only this one recital.

51:25.839 --> 51:28.272
Kieren barely understands
her homework.

51:28.274 --> 51:30.908
Look, how...
how many times is your job

51:30.910 --> 51:32.977
going to be more important
than this family?

51:32.979 --> 51:34.046
What?

51:34.048 --> 51:36.747
How many times is this job
going to be more important

51:36.749 --> 51:38.250
- than this family?
- I heard you.

51:38.252 --> 51:42.854
Jackson, I am a great mother,
and a phenomenal wife,

51:42.856 --> 51:44.957
and I have been that for years.

51:44.959 --> 51:48.060
And I'm just also trying to be
a brilliant career woman,

51:48.062 --> 51:49.895
and me receiving
this award tonight

51:49.897 --> 51:52.330
justifies that obviously
I'm pretty good at it.

51:52.332 --> 51:56.901
But I am still a phenomenal wife
and I am still a great woman.

51:56.903 --> 52:01.740
I am just now also
a phenomenal career woman.

52:01.742 --> 52:06.812
But I'm all three,
Jackson, all three,

52:06.814 --> 52:09.348
and I really would like
if my husband would support me

52:09.350 --> 52:13.250
and be there by my side
to help me climb up the ladder,

52:13.252 --> 52:15.687
not keep trying
to drag me down.

52:15.689 --> 52:17.656
- Drag you down?
- Yes.

52:17.658 --> 52:19.794
I'm sorry to drag you.

52:21.028 --> 52:23.962
Let us not pretend,
I don't support your career

52:23.964 --> 52:27.698
or what it's doing
to this family. Look at us.

52:27.700 --> 52:29.834
Jackson, wait.
Jackson!

52:29.836 --> 52:32.606
Jackson, would you just
please wait?

52:33.874 --> 52:38.343
Fine, you go to the recital
then and afterwards,

52:38.345 --> 52:41.015
can you and the kids
come meet me at the banquet?

52:42.982 --> 52:45.116
Okay.

52:45.118 --> 52:46.384
Okay.

52:46.386 --> 52:49.421
Congratulations.

52:49.423 --> 52:51.091
Thank you.

53:10.209 --> 53:11.144
Cheers.

53:15.214 --> 53:16.747
Hey, boss.

53:16.749 --> 53:22.386
Um. Hey! Hey.
What are you doing here?

53:22.388 --> 53:24.756
It is almost midnight.

53:24.758 --> 53:26.857
Well, I mean, if you want to
keep winning awards,

53:26.859 --> 53:28.225
someone's got to do the work.

53:28.227 --> 53:29.828
Say what?

53:29.830 --> 53:33.432
It was just a joke now,
but what are you doing here?

53:33.434 --> 53:35.200
Why aren't you out celebrating?

53:35.202 --> 53:37.035
I am.

53:37.037 --> 53:40.037
I am enjoying my drinks
and I am celebrating

53:40.039 --> 53:44.042
and toasting me because
nobody else gives a damn.

53:44.044 --> 53:47.779
Well, you look absolutely
beautiful tonight,

53:47.781 --> 53:51.183
and I admire the work
that you do.

53:51.185 --> 53:52.718
You truly inspire me.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.218
Thank you.

53:54.220 --> 53:58.890
I am so happy
that somebody that I know

53:58.892 --> 54:02.828
actually appreciates
the work that I do.

54:02.830 --> 54:04.863
You know what,
I know of a good way

54:04.865 --> 54:06.765
we could top off the night.

54:06.767 --> 54:08.200
Careful now, boy.

54:08.202 --> 54:11.102
That sounds like
an indecent proposal.

54:11.104 --> 54:13.073
It is.

54:17.810 --> 54:22.379
Oh, God, okay. Please, stop.
Please, let's stop.

54:22.381 --> 54:24.182
Please, stop.

54:24.184 --> 54:25.383
Just no.

54:25.385 --> 54:27.218
Can you help me up, please?

54:27.220 --> 54:30.023
Thank you.
Oh, God.

54:34.961 --> 54:39.230
No words necessary.

54:39.232 --> 54:40.832
It was awful.

54:40.834 --> 54:46.872
Oh God, you ain't never lied.
Oh God, it was awful.

54:46.874 --> 54:48.973
But you know what,
okay, I'm sorry, Darren.

54:48.975 --> 54:51.042
It was probably because
I had too much alcohol

54:51.044 --> 54:52.944
and there's a big
age difference between us

54:52.946 --> 54:55.346
and I can only get wet
for my husband

54:55.348 --> 54:58.250
and it's probably because...

54:58.252 --> 54:59.984
I'm gay.

54:59.986 --> 55:01.254
Oh.

55:02.990 --> 55:05.158
Thanks for letting me
stop here so late, girl.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.060
I just needed a night
away from Jackson.

55:10.062 --> 55:11.196
Renee? Please.

55:11.198 --> 55:14.265
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>
You know that.

55:14.267 --> 55:17.535
That's what friends are for.

55:17.537 --> 55:19.136
You and Jackson had a fight?

55:19.138 --> 55:21.939
Tell me, what happened
at the banquet?

55:21.941 --> 55:25.843
Jackson's hard-headed,
stubborn mule ass

55:25.845 --> 55:28.546
never even showed up.

55:28.548 --> 55:30.080
What?

55:30.082 --> 55:31.952
He never came to the banquet,

55:33.153 --> 55:35.587
and he made a heavy
guilt trip on me

55:35.589 --> 55:38.557
because I missed
our daughter's recital.

55:38.559 --> 55:43.194
So to make a long story short,

55:43.196 --> 55:45.999
me emotional,

55:47.568 --> 55:49.035
a lot of drinks,

55:50.604 --> 55:52.571
a cute enough assistant
that just thinks

55:52.573 --> 55:56.010
that I am God's gift to men,

55:58.211 --> 56:04.915
at work, after hours,
oh God, really bad foreplay.

56:04.917 --> 56:10.421
I mean, really,
really bad.

56:10.423 --> 56:12.890
Package wouldn't function.

56:12.892 --> 56:15.593
My self-esteem
plummets even further.

56:15.595 --> 56:17.428
Assistant tells me
he's gay.

56:17.430 --> 56:18.462
Mm-hmm!

56:18.464 --> 56:21.466
And, uh, me, now,

56:21.468 --> 56:24.468
2 AM, at your house,

56:24.470 --> 56:28.640
and I am drunk as a skunk.

56:28.642 --> 56:30.341
Oh, my God.

56:30.343 --> 56:35.479
I mean, I can't believe
you almost cheated on Jackson.

56:35.481 --> 56:37.918
And it was awful.

56:39.218 --> 56:43.220
My nipples are raw,
my vajayjay is bruised,

56:43.222 --> 56:46.323
and I don't mean that
in a good way.

56:46.325 --> 56:48.026
Hmm...

56:48.028 --> 56:54.267
So I take it you and Jackson
are having problems?

56:55.602 --> 56:57.636
Hmm.

56:57.638 --> 57:01.506
In fact, I have a feeling

57:01.508 --> 57:05.377
that if...
I am going to lose

57:05.379 --> 57:09.247
my husband and my family

57:09.249 --> 57:13.453
if I don't,
if I don't stop working.

57:14.921 --> 57:16.321
No.

57:16.323 --> 57:19.256
There's always going to be
shades of gray.

57:19.258 --> 57:23.060
You've got to find
the middle ground.

57:23.062 --> 57:26.131
Don't quit your job, okay.
Don't do that.

57:26.133 --> 57:28.002
You deserve to be happy.

57:31.004 --> 57:34.506
- Right.
- Okay.

57:34.508 --> 57:36.243
Thanks.

57:43.716 --> 57:46.618
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

57:48.421 --> 57:50.323
Hey Jackson, um...

57:52.225 --> 57:56.063
this morning you said to me
that we need to talk.

57:59.298 --> 58:02.435
Those can be some of the
scariest words that any wife...

58:04.403 --> 58:07.407
that any wife
hears from her husband,

58:09.176 --> 58:11.308
because for the first time
in our marriage,

58:11.310 --> 58:15.180
you have introduced
a fear to me

58:15.182 --> 58:17.517
that our marriage
could come to an end.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.687
And of course, I know I could
probably be assuming the worst,

58:22.689 --> 58:24.258
but Jackson, I'm...

58:26.593 --> 58:29.297
you're my heart,

58:32.298 --> 58:35.468
and our family
means everything to me.

58:45.745 --> 58:50.749
If uh...
if working means losing you,

58:50.751 --> 58:53.486
then I promise you
I will quit.

58:56.622 --> 58:58.689
I just want things
to go back

58:58.691 --> 59:01.161
the way they used to be
between us.

59:02.595 --> 59:04.364
I need you.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.537
Jackson, I need you.

59:10.736 --> 59:12.339
Jack...

59:13.439 --> 59:14.541
Damn.

59:37.597 --> 59:40.531
These women.

59:40.533 --> 59:43.834
Wow, they have been sending me
all kinds of texts,

59:43.836 --> 59:46.537
threatening voicemails.

59:46.539 --> 59:49.640
I pay them no mind, okay.
I have things to do.

59:49.642 --> 59:51.776
I have a life to prepare.

59:51.778 --> 59:54.448
Got to get ready
for my man's arrival.

01:00:00.821 --> 01:00:04.589
Well, would you
look at the time.

01:00:04.591 --> 01:00:07.524
It's almost 7 PM.

01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:10.097
He'll be here shortly.

01:00:27.214 --> 01:00:31.252
So you're drinking now.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.852
You disgust me.

01:00:34.854 --> 01:00:39.189
Oh Eric,
after the day I've had,

01:00:39.191 --> 01:00:42.192
no, the year I've had,

01:00:42.194 --> 01:00:44.529
frankly darling,
I don't give a damn

01:00:44.531 --> 01:00:45.696
what you think.

01:00:45.698 --> 01:00:50.200
All right. Like having
one night stands with strippers

01:00:50.202 --> 01:00:52.636
and cursing?

01:00:52.638 --> 01:00:54.772
That's so disrespectful.

01:00:54.774 --> 01:00:56.341
Disrespectful?

01:00:56.343 --> 01:00:58.676
No, disrespectful
is getting a message

01:00:58.678 --> 01:01:00.812
from your husband's mistress.

01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:03.180
- My what?
- Your whore.

01:01:03.182 --> 01:01:06.350
Yeah, Jessa, she sent us
a message via DVD,

01:01:06.352 --> 01:01:08.453
actually it was quite cute.

01:01:08.455 --> 01:01:11.388
And you're calling
someone else a whore?

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.258
Please.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.560
You're defending
your mistress to me.

01:01:15.562 --> 01:01:16.560
Is that it?

01:01:16.562 --> 01:01:20.198
You know you lost your rights
to question me

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.669
when you opened your legs
up to another man.

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:27.738
Frankly, Eric,
I'm surprised you're here

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.906
because your mistress said

01:01:28.908 --> 01:01:30.642
you wouldn't be
coming home tonight.

01:01:30.644 --> 01:01:32.776
Oh wait, did you forget
something?

01:01:32.778 --> 01:01:34.312
Was it your Bible?

01:01:34.314 --> 01:01:37.714
Not that I care,
but those are lies.

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:39.816
Are they?

01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:42.252
You know, having to listen
to my wife have sex

01:01:42.254 --> 01:01:43.691
with another man
on the phone...

01:01:45.524 --> 01:01:47.524
I wouldn't care
if I brought a woman home

01:01:47.526 --> 01:01:50.895
and screwed her
in your bed.

01:01:50.897 --> 01:01:54.732
Why are you here, huh?

01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:56.700
I punished myself,

01:01:56.702 --> 01:01:59.571
and I've allowed you to
punish me over and over again.

01:01:59.573 --> 01:02:04.542
But no, no, no more,
Bishop Eric Maurice Hall.

01:02:04.544 --> 01:02:06.678
No more.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.348
What do you mean by that?

01:02:15.254 --> 01:02:17.254
Like I said,
what do you mean by that?

01:02:17.256 --> 01:02:20.424
What do I mean?
I'll tell you what I mean.

01:02:20.426 --> 01:02:22.694
All my life, I've tried to be
the perfect little girl.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:25.529
I got the perfect grades,
I never got my clothes dirty,

01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:27.999
I never did anything wrong
because I wanted my parents

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:29.600
to be so happy
and so proud of me.

01:02:29.602 --> 01:02:31.502
- And?
- And you know what I mean, Eric.

01:02:31.504 --> 01:02:32.837
You know exactly what I mean.

01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:34.404
My entire life,
through college,

01:02:34.406 --> 01:02:36.406
I wanted everyone to like me,
and this marriage,

01:02:36.408 --> 01:02:37.642
I wanted it
to be perfect.

01:02:37.644 --> 01:02:39.544
The perfect everything,
the perfect wife,

01:02:39.546 --> 01:02:41.745
the perfect first lady,
but I'm tired of being perfect,

01:02:41.747 --> 01:02:43.814
and you know what?
You can take your perfect whore

01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:45.752
and have a perfect
little life together.

01:02:46.986 --> 01:02:49.287
Jamie.

01:02:49.289 --> 01:02:51.589
What? What?

01:02:51.591 --> 01:02:54.725
Don't speak
because I'm done.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.794
I'm done talking.

01:02:56.796 --> 01:02:59.930
I'm done begging,
I'm done praying.

01:02:59.932 --> 01:03:04.002
I'm done being treated
like a second class whore

01:03:04.004 --> 01:03:05.673
in my own house.

01:03:07.374 --> 01:03:11.743
I wish you
and Jessa the best.

01:03:11.745 --> 01:03:13.611
I pray for you.

01:03:13.613 --> 01:03:16.680
My church has been
in this family for 50 years

01:03:16.682 --> 01:03:19.417
and I will not allow you
to embarrass me

01:03:19.419 --> 01:03:21.352
or my family
from that congregation

01:03:21.354 --> 01:03:23.754
with this nonsense
that you're talking.

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:26.758
Now I don't believe in divorce
and you know that, Jamie.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.627
I do, and I didn't believe
in it either,

01:03:30.629 --> 01:03:34.501
until I realized how disgusting
it was being married to you.

01:03:40.339 --> 01:03:42.807
I will kill you

01:03:42.809 --> 01:03:45.646
before I allow you
to leave this marriage.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:50.480
What are you going to do,
Bishop?

01:03:50.482 --> 01:03:57.754
Put me in a chokehold,
pin me down, strangle me,

01:03:57.756 --> 01:04:00.924
read some scripture?

01:04:02.095 --> 01:04:04.430
That's what I thought.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.817
What up, stranger?
Where you been?

01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:30.587
Haven't seen you in a while.
You used to come by every month.

01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:33.825
Oh, well,
I've just been busy.

01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:35.729
You came to see me?

01:04:40.466 --> 01:04:44.704
You don't want to go back
into that club, do you?

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:55.848
And you want me to do you again,
don't you?

01:05:01.553 --> 01:05:04.925
Get a room.
I should be done by 12.

01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:10.863
Oh, Pleasure,

01:05:14.968 --> 01:05:16.537
how much?

01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:19.136
All night?

01:05:19.138 --> 01:05:22.343
All night.

01:05:23.142 --> 01:05:24.877
Two thousand.

01:05:27.147 --> 01:05:29.383
See you later.

01:05:46.499 --> 01:05:48.165
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:49.669
Have a good day?

01:05:50.736 --> 01:05:54.071
- It was cool.
- Did you catch any fish?

01:05:54.073 --> 01:05:55.676
I'm going to take a shower.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.620
I'll call you back.

01:06:09.622 --> 01:06:11.656
Hey, so is everybody
still coming over

01:06:11.658 --> 01:06:13.491
for the fish fry later
and play cards?

01:06:13.493 --> 01:06:16.160
Yeah, as far as I know.

01:06:16.162 --> 01:06:17.794
Eric and Kingston too?

01:06:17.796 --> 01:06:19.964
Yeah, you just asked me that.

01:06:19.966 --> 01:06:22.536
Okay, just asking.

01:07:04.711 --> 01:07:05.812
Renee...

01:07:06.946 --> 01:07:07.981
Really?

01:07:09.115 --> 01:07:10.850
You got my phone?

01:07:16.222 --> 01:07:17.723
Why do you have
my phone?

01:07:22.761 --> 01:07:27.098
Jackson,
do you want a divorce?

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.636
- Do you?
- Hell no. I do not.

01:07:31.638 --> 01:07:34.238
I do not want
a divorce, Jackson.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.276
I don't.
Didn't you get my message?

01:07:38.278 --> 01:07:39.977
Yeah, I got your message.

01:07:39.979 --> 01:07:42.245
Then what else do I have to do
to prove to you

01:07:42.247 --> 01:07:44.682
that I want this marriage
to work?

01:07:44.684 --> 01:07:47.984
What do you want from me?

01:07:47.986 --> 01:07:49.687
You want me to beg you?

01:07:49.689 --> 01:07:54.691
Fine, look at me.
I am down on my knees.

01:07:54.693 --> 01:07:57.962
Please, please don't leave me.

01:07:57.964 --> 01:07:59.863
Please, don't give up on us.
Please.

01:07:59.865 --> 01:08:01.933
Renee, get up.
Renee, get up.

01:08:01.935 --> 01:08:04.834
No, Jackson, please.
I don't care about that job.

01:08:04.836 --> 01:08:06.102
To hell with that career.

01:08:06.104 --> 01:08:08.238
- Please!
- Renee...

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.207
Please, Jackson,
I love you.

01:08:11.209 --> 01:08:13.678
Jackson, please,
I love you.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.649
Renee,
listen to me.

01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:22.920
Jackson, I don't care about
what happened in the past.

01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:24.755
I just need to make sure
that you and I

01:08:24.756 --> 01:08:28.192
can move forward
together now.

01:08:28.194 --> 01:08:31.631
If I could leave the past
in the past, I would.

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:35.966
I'm sorry.

01:08:35.968 --> 01:08:39.135
For what? What?

01:08:39.136 --> 01:08:42.238
- I love you.
- But?

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.943
I, um...
I had an affair.

01:08:45.944 --> 01:08:50.814
I had a one-night stand,
and she's pregnant.

01:08:50.816 --> 01:08:54.719
I'm sorry, I never meant
for this to happen.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.853
Jessa's having your baby?

01:08:56.854 --> 01:08:58.889
Je... What are you
talking about?

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:00.890
What the hell
does Jessa have to...

01:09:00.892 --> 01:09:03.861
what are you talking about?

01:09:03.863 --> 01:09:05.830
Just listen.

01:09:05.832 --> 01:09:09.035
Shut up.
You shut up!

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:12.805
Look, Renee...

01:09:24.751 --> 01:09:27.785
Let's try
and figure out...

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:30.388
whoa, whoa, Renee.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.921
Renee.

01:09:31.923 --> 01:09:35.662
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:41.732
Are you having an affair
with Jessa?

01:09:41.734 --> 01:09:43.733
What? No.

01:09:43.734 --> 01:09:46.737
The one-night stand
has nothing to do with Jessa.

01:09:46.738 --> 01:09:49.807
Why are you saying that?

01:09:49.809 --> 01:09:52.779
I need you to get out
of this house.

01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:57.014
Babe, I'm-I'm sorry,
I don't...

01:09:57.016 --> 01:09:58.652
Get out, Jackson.

01:10:01.154 --> 01:10:02.923
Get out!

01:10:13.332 --> 01:10:14.801
Jackson.

01:10:22.275 --> 01:10:23.844
Jackson!

01:10:47.132 --> 01:10:49.135
Damn it, Kingston.

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:52.071
Damn you, Kingston.

01:10:53.306 --> 01:10:56.340
Why'd you do this to me?
Why'd you do this to me?

01:10:56.342 --> 01:11:00.443
You son of a bitch,
how could you do this to me?

01:11:00.445 --> 01:11:04.081
Damn you, Kingston.

01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:10.153
Damn you, you stupid,
piece of, stupid...

01:11:10.155 --> 01:11:12.456
Damn you, Kingston.

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:17.393
Baby, the heck did I do?
What's going on?

01:11:17.395 --> 01:11:20.096
It's not you.
It's not me.

01:11:20.098 --> 01:11:25.870
What? Okay. Well,
I need to go fishing more.

01:11:25.872 --> 01:11:28.839
Baby, all right, listen.
I stink.

01:11:28.841 --> 01:11:30.241
I've been on a boat
all day, okay?

01:11:30.243 --> 01:11:32.209
- Let me just get in the shower.
- No, no, homie.

01:11:32.211 --> 01:11:35.845
We about to take this off
right now.

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:37.348
Okay, so we do it real quick,
all right?

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:40.187
Remember, we've got to get over
to Jackson's, all right?

01:11:44.289 --> 01:11:45.523
Where is Eric?

01:11:45.525 --> 01:11:47.928
I don't know.
He's at home.

01:11:49.227 --> 01:11:51.996
And Jackson,
is he at home too?

01:11:51.998 --> 01:11:53.898
Yeah. Why?

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.834
What? Oh God, what?

01:11:56.836 --> 01:11:58.135
Are you screwing Jessa?

01:11:58.137 --> 01:12:00.504
Ow. No,
I'm not screwing Jessa.

01:12:00.506 --> 01:12:02.872
Are you screwing Jessa?

01:12:02.874 --> 01:12:04.474
Baby, I'm not screwing Jessa,

01:12:04.476 --> 01:12:06.143
or any other woman,
for that matter.

01:12:06.145 --> 01:12:10.014
What's going on?
Wh-what's going on? What?

01:12:10.016 --> 01:12:11.881
Jessa sent
this stupid DVD message

01:12:11.883 --> 01:12:14.585
to me, Renee, and Jamie,

01:12:14.587 --> 01:12:16.420
saying that
she's having an affair

01:12:16.422 --> 01:12:18.154
with one of our husbands,

01:12:18.156 --> 01:12:22.593
and he's planning to leave
one of us for her today.

01:12:22.595 --> 01:12:26.162
- What?
- She packed up and everything.

01:12:26.164 --> 01:12:30.000
Okay, well, listen Aria,
I don't know what's going on,

01:12:30.002 --> 01:12:31.501
- with Jessa...
- Don't touch me.

01:12:31.503 --> 01:12:33.170
...or anybody else.

01:12:33.172 --> 01:12:34.537
But, look...

01:12:34.539 --> 01:12:37.942
I'm not about to leave you
for her or any other woman.

01:12:37.944 --> 01:12:39.443
What's wrong with you?

01:12:39.445 --> 01:12:42.947
I wish I could believe that,
but with all three of you home

01:12:42.949 --> 01:12:46.282
and Jessa having
no reason to lie,

01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:48.585
either one of you
changed your mind

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:50.888
or plans to dip out later.

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:52.923
But one of you betrayed us,

01:12:52.925 --> 01:12:55.593
and I need to know
if that's you.

01:12:55.595 --> 01:12:58.932
No, I told you,
no, it's not.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.166
What?

01:13:02.168 --> 01:13:06.937
Every, every conversation
you've had with Jessa,

01:13:06.939 --> 01:13:10.941
every time
we spent time together,

01:13:10.943 --> 01:13:12.910
every look, every touch,

01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:16.013
that all seemed
so innocent then.

01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:19.316
It's all suspect now,
all of it.

01:13:19.318 --> 01:13:21.352
So wait a minute,

01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:23.653
not only do you think
that I cheat on you,

01:13:23.655 --> 01:13:27.992
you think that I would cheat
on you with your best friend?

01:13:27.994 --> 01:13:30.560
That's the husband
that you married?

01:13:30.562 --> 01:13:31.929
Huh?

01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:33.363
You know what,
if you think that,

01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:35.331
then you and I
have some big problems.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:37.635
If you were planning to
leave me for some other woman,

01:13:37.637 --> 01:13:40.237
then we have
an even bigger problem.

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:42.238
You can go to hell,
that's the problem we got.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.375
Of course you would say that.

01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:47.978
Of course, Kingston.
What else would you say?

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.913
Yes, I was screwing Jessa

01:13:49.915 --> 01:13:52.416
and I was planning
to leave you for her?

01:13:52.418 --> 01:13:54.151
Bitch, please.

01:13:54.153 --> 01:13:57.153
I'm your husband, all right?

01:13:57.155 --> 01:13:59.290
Watch your mouth,
have some respect.

01:13:59.292 --> 01:14:02.459
Or what else, bitch?

01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:04.527
You know what, get yourself
together, all right?

01:14:04.529 --> 01:14:08.165
Now when you're ready
to have a grown conversation

01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.033
a-and control yourself
like an adult,

01:14:10.035 --> 01:14:11.568
then we can have a conversation,
all right?

01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:14.270
- We're talking about this now.
- I'm not talking about it now.

01:14:14.272 --> 01:14:16.407
Kingston, we're talking
about this right now.

01:14:16.409 --> 01:14:19.279
Kingston! Get back here!

01:16:23.569 --> 01:16:26.373
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:32.544
I guess the last laugh
is on me.

01:16:34.747 --> 01:16:43.155
My lover, oh, my lover, the man
that I gave up so much for...

01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:47.060
...he never showed up.

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.430
He never even called.

01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:55.331
When I tried to call him,

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:58.337
his phone just went
straight to voicemail.

01:17:02.574 --> 01:17:04.376
I'm not heartless.

01:17:05.543 --> 01:17:07.243
I'm not.

01:17:07.245 --> 01:17:09.582
Those women were my friends.

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:13.850
We shared many moments together.

01:17:13.852 --> 01:17:17.089
We have many memories.

01:17:18.723 --> 01:17:22.593
I know... I know the affair
with me and lover was wrong,

01:17:22.595 --> 01:17:24.228
but...

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:27.400
my husband's death was...

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:34.140
It was so painful.

01:17:35.874 --> 01:17:40.145
The loneliness and the grief,

01:17:41.312 --> 01:17:43.714
it was unbearable.

01:17:43.716 --> 01:17:46.186
It was unbearable.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.821
And after our first night
together,

01:17:50.823 --> 01:17:52.688
I just became consumed
with him.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.758
He was like the light

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.794
in my life of... of darkness...

01:17:57.796 --> 01:18:01.831
and... and gloom.

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:06.505
He said all the right things,
he did all the right things,

01:18:07.772 --> 01:18:11.675
he convinced me that he was
willing to walk away

01:18:11.677 --> 01:18:13.743
from it all.

01:18:13.745 --> 01:18:15.414
I bet on love...

01:18:16.915 --> 01:18:19.686
and lost.

01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:26.657
Do I regret sending
those taunting messages

01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:31.929
to my friends who are
definitely now foes?

01:18:31.931 --> 01:18:36.369
I, uh... I don't know.

01:18:38.204 --> 01:18:40.140
It was spiteful...

01:18:42.574 --> 01:18:44.144
and childish.

01:18:46.645 --> 01:18:51.684
At the end of the day,
my relationship with...

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.721
I guess I should start
referring to him

01:18:58.723 --> 01:19:00.627
by his government name.

01:19:02.394 --> 01:19:06.563
The relationship I had with...

01:19:27.253 --> 01:19:29.419
Did you have a good night?

01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:32.624
Did you...
I didn't.

01:19:36.729 --> 01:19:40.330
Yeah, I know, okay.
I know, it was.

01:19:40.332 --> 01:19:41.665
It was childish, I agree.

01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:46.405
So just... just come over here
and spank me.

01:19:50.575 --> 01:19:53.443
Not a good time to go public?

01:19:53.445 --> 01:19:54.777
What are you saying,
lover?

01:19:59.418 --> 01:20:00.783
Okay wait, so you're
trying to tell me

01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:03.353
that everything you told me
has just been a lie?

01:20:03.355 --> 01:20:05.758
You want to use me up
and just throw me away?

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.626
No, no, you're a liar.
You're a liar,

01:20:10.628 --> 01:20:12.763
because you weren't even
supposed to go back there.

01:20:12.765 --> 01:20:16.465
You were supposed to come
straight here, to me.

01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:19.638
Oh please, you had
no intentions of leaving her.

01:20:25.644 --> 01:20:26.713
A break?

01:20:30.615 --> 01:20:32.551
You want to take a break?

01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:38.390
I uh...

01:20:39.824 --> 01:20:44.496
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, lover.
