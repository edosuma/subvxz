WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:11.968
Now, I know you're sad

00:12.012 --> 00:14.840
about not finishing
the marathon, but don't worry.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.017
You know who else never
finished a marathon?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
Abraham Lincoln.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.456
Socrates. Uh, Meryl Streep.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.068
Hold up. You don't know that
about Meryl.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.288
She can do anything.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.072
Okay, Dennis.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.987
Just keep that on there.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.206
I got to race to
my next patient.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.122
Okay.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.993
Oh, excuse me.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.343
Wow, I have never seen
Marathon Day

00:39.387 --> 00:41.345
from inside of a hospital.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.347
I just love the
hustle and bustle.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.740
So much excitement.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.958
So much stupidity.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.090
Marathons are stupid.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.831
I mean, the first guy
that ran one

00:48.874 --> 00:50.528
literally dropped dead,
but people looked at that

00:50.572 --> 00:53.401
and thought, "Oh, yeah,
that's for me."Yeah.

00:53.444 --> 00:56.056
So, your doctor told you
to get a little exercise,

00:56.099 --> 00:58.406
and you took that as,
"Run until you pass out"?

00:58.449 --> 01:01.061
Eh.Come on, man.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.064
I just want to pull
these people aside

01:04.107 --> 01:05.848
and say,
"What are you running from?"

01:05.891 --> 01:07.371
But I know the answer.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.025
Their sexuality.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.072
Or credit card debt.Yeah.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.204
Why haven't we started rounds?

01:14.248 --> 01:16.119
Is Dr. Jacobs... late?

01:16.163 --> 01:17.468
CALEB:
Oh, that's impossible.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
She's never late. Are we early?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.645
That doesn't sound like us.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.125
[elevator bell chimes]

01:22.169 --> 01:23.126
Ah!

01:23.170 --> 01:24.910
Apologies for my tardiness.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.522
I got caught up
in marathon traffic.[Lexie groans]

01:27.565 --> 01:30.481
The worst, right?Oh, a small price to pay

01:30.525 --> 01:33.963
for these lionhearts to
undertake their heroic journey.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.357
Today is one of our
busiest of the year.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.794
But, unlike Pheidippides,

01:38.837 --> 01:41.013
the esteemed runner of Marathon,

01:41.057 --> 01:43.494
your journey
will encompass injuries

01:43.538 --> 01:47.542
ranging from dehydration
to metatarsal stress fractures.

01:47.585 --> 01:50.240
Feet? I hadn't really thought
about treating feet.

01:50.284 --> 01:53.069
What'd you think we were gonna
be treating on Marathon Day?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.505
Gingivitis?

01:54.549 --> 01:56.072
FROST:
Dr. Jacobs.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.813
Did you get stuck
in traffic, as well?

01:57.856 --> 02:00.120
There was a bit of a logjam
around mile 17,

02:00.163 --> 02:02.165
but I was able to separate
from the pack

02:02.209 --> 02:04.689
and clock a personal best
for the final nine miles.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.215
Wait, are you late because
you just ran the marathon?

02:08.258 --> 02:09.259
DANIEL [laughs]:
Wow.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.565
You just ran 26 miles,

02:10.608 --> 02:12.088
and you're less
out of breath

02:12.132 --> 02:14.395
than Dr. Sommers after
a rant about bees.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.659
Just saying, if
they go, we go.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.269
How do you feel?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.618
Never felt sharper.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.098
Yeah, I get it.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.839
Exercise does wonders
for the brain.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.449
There's Carol doing a crossword

02:25.493 --> 02:27.930
and Carol doing a crossword
after Zumba.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.975
The difference is amazing.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.153
Let's move.Yeah.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.374
Dr. Jacobs, are we...

02:37.418 --> 02:39.463
moving? Dr. Jacobs?

02:39.507 --> 02:42.118
One minute. I just have to...

02:42.162 --> 02:43.772
Are you okay?Yes.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.382
But you're falling down.I don't think so.

02:45.426 --> 02:48.037
You're on the floor.Agree to disagree.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.302
â™ª

02:53.782 --> 02:54.783
[beep]

02:58.221 --> 02:59.831
Now, our first
patient is a hero

02:59.875 --> 03:02.399
who sacrificed her
body for glory.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.880
Now, who would like
to take a crack

03:04.923 --> 03:06.534
at the differential
diagnosis?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.144
Dr. Sommers.Allow me.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.929
Patient exhibits symptoms
of mild dehydration

03:10.973 --> 03:13.193
and is experiencing
mild muscle spasms

03:13.236 --> 03:14.803
in her left quadricep.

03:14.846 --> 03:15.847
Case closed.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.852
Honestly, I'm fine.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.027
I just need some fluids,

03:22.071 --> 03:23.290
and I'll be ready
to get back to work.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.074
Although the collapse
could be the result

03:25.117 --> 03:26.249
of a number
of complications.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.685
One that springs
immediately to mind:

03:27.729 --> 03:29.209
running a marathon.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.908
I couldn't even tell
you were collapsing.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.737
I just thought, "What an
incredible way to sit."

03:39.306 --> 03:41.264
Does everyone
have to be here?

03:42.918 --> 03:44.833
You know, we should really run
some additional tests

03:44.876 --> 03:46.269
to rule out
irregular heartbeat

03:46.313 --> 03:48.228
and lung disease and
monitor those muscle spasms

03:48.271 --> 03:50.360
to make sure there's
nothing more serious.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.883
I don't need
additional testing.

03:51.927 --> 03:54.712
My fall was obviously a result
of dehydration.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.366
There's no reason to waste

03:56.410 --> 03:58.325
valuable patient bed space
on me.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.196
Nonsense.
Now, who among you

04:00.240 --> 04:02.764
is up to the task of
helping our gladiator?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.337
Dr. Kenney.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.862
We've made eye contact.

04:13.905 --> 04:14.993
Oh.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.343
She's all yours.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.388
Oh![monitor beeping quickly]

04:18.432 --> 04:20.303
Think the monitor's shot.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.306
No, it's working just fine.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.657
Uh, hold up, interns.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.833
I've got to stop by radiology.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.966
Dr. Kenney, you'll
be with Dr. Jacobs.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.534
The rest of you, get your hats
and prepare to hold on to them.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.318
You're riding with me.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.407
[whispers]:
Yeah!

04:37.451 --> 04:39.627
A day off from Dr. Jacobs?

04:39.670 --> 04:42.456
Oh, my gosh.
My back just stopped hurting.

04:43.457 --> 04:46.373
Oh, Carol,
you drew the short stick,

04:46.416 --> 04:48.592
which, to you, probably just
looks like a regular stick.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.336
This is great. I get
to spend the entire day

04:53.380 --> 04:55.556
impressing Dr. Frost
with my medical savvy.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.340
Uh, slow down, cowboy.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.343
Yesterday, you lost your watch
in the MRI machine.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.606
Okay, guys, guys,
the point is

05:02.650 --> 05:04.565
this sucks for Carol.[chuckles]

05:04.608 --> 05:07.350
No, this does not
"sucks for Carol."

05:07.394 --> 05:09.134
I'm glad she's my patient.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.658
I see this as an opportunity.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.443
To be kicked out of the program?No.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.706
To have a hospital food tray
thrown at your head?

05:15.750 --> 05:18.318
No.To rapidly go full gray?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.930
No, but thank you
for thinking it's natural.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.410
No, I will finally

05:23.453 --> 05:25.368
gain her respect as a doctor.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.891
How? In case
you haven't noticed,

05:26.935 --> 05:28.589
we've been trying to do that
for the past month.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.807
Trying?
[scoffs]

05:29.851 --> 05:31.983
Succeeding.

05:32.027 --> 05:35.030
For your information,
I plan to give Dr. Jacobs

05:35.073 --> 05:37.380
the full Carol Kenney treatment.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.688
So, what, like, lots
of pointless stories?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.603
No.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.344
I am going to win
Dr. Jacobs over

05:44.387 --> 05:47.434
through excellent medical care
delivered with compassion.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.696
I like your stories, Carol.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.350
They remind me of jazz.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.351
Oh!

05:51.394 --> 05:52.569
They go everywhere,

05:52.613 --> 05:54.049
you never know how long
they're gonna take,

05:54.092 --> 05:55.442
and you can zone out
in the middle

05:55.485 --> 05:57.879
and still get
the general idea.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.492
Well, I like to think
of my stories more like hip-hop.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.451
They are cool, edgy

06:04.494 --> 06:06.540
and often feature
unexpected cameos,

06:06.583 --> 06:09.194
like the time I saw Yo-Yo Ma
at the grocery store.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.464
Well, this next marathoner
earned himself a medal

06:17.507 --> 06:19.944
and a particularly gruesome case
of foot ulcers.

06:19.988 --> 06:22.599
Oh, no.
[exhales]

06:22.643 --> 06:24.427
Why doesn't everyone sidle up
right next to me

06:24.471 --> 06:26.473
and take a gander.

06:26.516 --> 06:30.607
You'll notice a
splendid greenish tint

06:30.651 --> 06:33.480
reminiscent of
Monet's NymphÃ©as,

06:33.523 --> 06:36.396
which means we are most likely
dealing with an infection.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.832
Ah, the foot.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.356
It's a curious beast.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.880
I'm gonna dig
into this one.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.448
[grunts]

06:45.492 --> 06:48.277
Caleb, you look whiter
than usual,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.409
which is saying something,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.846
'cause you own two pairs
of Birkenstocks.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.501
You know how every doctor

06:54.544 --> 06:56.720
has their one medical thing
that grosses them out?

06:56.764 --> 06:59.331
Yeah, mine's bile.
It's vomit's vomit.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.204
I hate phlegm.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.902
I mean, if the Germans named it,
you know it's bad.

07:04.946 --> 07:08.253
Well, none of the traditionally
disgusting things bother me.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.081
But one night in medical school,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.823
I got trapped in a room
with a rotting foot.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.479
And I haven't been
the same since.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.786
So?

07:18.829 --> 07:20.614
My ex-girlfriend had warts
on every toe.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.354
Move on.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.487
[chuckles]:
Oh, boy!

07:25.532 --> 07:27.098
This abscess

07:27.142 --> 07:29.449
is fully encased
in a sac of fluid.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.668
Okay.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.410
This patient goes to, uh...

07:34.454 --> 07:35.411
Dr. Kutcher.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.979
Yes!Yes!

07:38.022 --> 07:40.068
Hello. I'm Dr. Kenney.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.939
[laughs]
Isn't this fun?

07:44.507 --> 07:46.422
Here we go.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.599
[sighs] Looks like the teacher
has become the student

07:49.643 --> 07:52.646
and the student, who was a
teacher, has become the doctor.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.433
Well, I see patient's
sense of humor

07:57.477 --> 07:59.261
is in critical condition.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.484
Dr. Kenney,
this is a waste of time.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.703
Just release me
so I can get back to work.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.575
After my exam.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.664
Now, are you currently
taking any medications?

08:10.707 --> 08:12.579
Nothing relevant to this.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.103
[sighs]
Right, but I still have to...

08:15.146 --> 08:18.193
Tell you what,
I'll say if you say.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.324
On three, huh?

08:19.368 --> 08:21.196
One, two, three.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.632
Estrogen. Come on!

08:24.591 --> 08:25.983
Okay, all right.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.811
I know that
you're convinced

08:27.855 --> 08:30.031
that that pain in your
leg is a charley horse,

08:30.074 --> 08:32.512
but I still think that
we need to run a CT scan

08:32.555 --> 08:34.339
so we can rule
out a blood clot.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.558
It's not a blood clot.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.125
How can you be so sure?

08:37.168 --> 08:39.214
Because you've been a doctor
for all of a month.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.911
It's a cramp.Okay.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.478
I really want to run a CT,

08:42.522 --> 08:43.914
but let's get your
I.V. started first.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.263
And don't worry.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.831
I have treated
my superiors before.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.356
Our principal refused
to believe he had lice.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.185
I had to examine him myself.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.535
Yeah.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.929
He had 'em.
I had to shave his head.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.496
Mm-hmm.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.759
You know how some people
don't look great bald?

09:02.803 --> 09:04.935
Please stop.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.154
I can just do it myself.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.286
I actually have
already placed it.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.682
Well, that wasn't
a complete train wreck.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.292
[chuckles]

09:14.336 --> 09:16.730
Well, sometimes I find
distracting the patients

09:16.773 --> 09:19.689
creates a relaxing environment.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.517
Oh, hey.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.650
I see you had the BCG vaccine.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.087
Hmm. You must have traveled
abroad as a child.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.655
Perhaps I did.Huh.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.700
"Perhaps." "Not a
complete train wreck."

09:30.744 --> 09:32.659
What's next, "I
love you, Carol"?Oh.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.622
I-I still think that you should
get the CT scan on your leg.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.711
All right, Dr. Kenney.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.671
If you think it's worthwhile,
then schedule the scan.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.281
Really? Oh, fantastic.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.718
Should I say "scan-tastic"?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.200
I should not.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.463
Sometimes you have to cross
the line to see the line.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.425
You weren't kidding, Dr. Frost.
Marathon Day gets busy.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.862
Of course I wasn't kidding.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.341
I only kid about baby goats.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.692
[laughs][chuckles]

10:05.735 --> 10:07.432
[groans]
There's more of them?

10:07.476 --> 10:09.609
Why doesn't the marathon
just end at the hospital?

10:09.652 --> 10:12.437
A lot of people run
to raise money for good causes.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.787
Oh, you're right. Yeah.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.658
A marathon's gonna be
the difference maker.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.617
That's what the scientists say.
"Just one more marathon,

10:17.660 --> 10:19.619
and we'll have
the cure for cancer."

10:20.924 --> 10:22.404
I have a patient
who needs

10:22.447 --> 10:23.666
immediate medical
attention.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.363
Jeans and a 4/20 shirt?

10:25.407 --> 10:27.714
[chuckles] This guy
didn't run a marathon.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.325
I'll take him.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.762
Fantastic initiative,
Dr. Sommers.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.155
DENNIS:
Great.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.765
Uh, he's septic,

10:35.809 --> 10:38.681
which has led to
a foot infection.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.857
Gnarly stuff.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.730
You have to take him.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.167
Uh, and every foot
patient we have.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.603
No way. We're slammed.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.692
And everyone today
is a foot patient.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.651
Please. I-I'll
do anything.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.392
I'll write your discharge
summaries for a month.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.046
Two months!

10:56.090 --> 10:57.961
Three months, and
you wash our scrubs.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.484
And you buy our lunches.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.485
Fine.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.661
But no chips.

11:01.704 --> 11:02.662
You have a deal.

11:05.403 --> 11:08.276
Why am I smiling,
you ask?

11:08.319 --> 11:10.452
No.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.715
I'll tell you
why I'm smiling.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.587
Dr. Jacobs is now taking
my medical advice.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.372
Oh, it's so satisfying.

11:17.415 --> 11:20.941
[singsongy]: This isn't a
journey I'm going on with you.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.553
I was given an opportunity,
and I seized it.

11:24.596 --> 11:25.728
Carpe diem?

11:25.772 --> 11:26.729
Well, diem carpe'd.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.688
I have earned her respect.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.298
Uh...You know,

11:30.341 --> 11:32.822
I think this is the beginning of
a new relationship between us.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.477
All right, 102 needs
more fluids and an X-ray.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.393
And 105 is still waiting
on the results...Okay, what are you doing?

11:38.436 --> 11:39.960
We both agreed
you were gonna get a CT scan.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.613
Dr. Jacobs,
you have to get back in bed.

11:41.657 --> 11:42.876
No, I have to get back to work.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.051
No, you have to get back in bed.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.400
What are you gonna do,
ground me?

11:45.443 --> 11:46.706
Yes, I am.

11:46.749 --> 11:47.881
I am taking away
your privileges.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.709
You can no longer...

11:49.752 --> 11:51.275
I don't know what
you like to do,

11:51.319 --> 11:52.886
but, whatever it is,
you can't do it.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.416
So, you never had any
intention of getting a CT?

12:01.459 --> 12:04.114
Of course not.
I told you, I'm fine.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.899
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:05.942 --> 12:07.901
I need to tend
to my patients.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.598
Oh!

12:09.641 --> 12:11.121
Okay, that does
not seem fine.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.949
Can we get some
help over here?

12:12.993 --> 12:15.996
No need! Everything's fine.
I'm basically up.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.214
Dennis, quick, grab
that wheelchair.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.825
Here, help me get her in.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.044
Dennis, do not help me up.Dennis, don't listen to her.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.567
Dennis.Dennis.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.353
Boss. Not my boss.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.443
I got this.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.058
[grunts]

12:43.371 --> 12:46.113
And you wanted to help me.
[chuckles]

12:46.156 --> 12:48.202
Okay, we need to get
her a CT right now.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.812
She might have a blood clot.
Let's go.

12:49.856 --> 12:50.813
I'll wheel myself.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.075
No, don't be ridiculous.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.120
I will take you.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.383
Dennis, take care of this.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.608
How would you feel
if I did that to you?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.001
[scoffs]

13:05.045 --> 13:06.916
I'd be deeply
impressed.

13:12.704 --> 13:15.577
Oh, hey. Got another
foot patient for you.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.144
[scoffs]
We can't. We're slammed.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.320
But what about our deal?
All right,

13:19.363 --> 13:22.149
I'll pay for lunch
and get chips.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.933
Interesting.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.108
No.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.589
No. Deal's off.
It's not worth it.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.374
This was supposed to be our
fun day without Dr. Jacobs.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.595
It was supposed to be my
special day with Dr. Frost.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.119
Instead, it's been
a never-ending foot parade

13:36.163 --> 13:37.468
because of you.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.297
You guys, I'd love to help,
but I can't.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.690
But you can.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.823
Caleb, we figured out
how to fix you.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.520
It's called exposure therapy.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.609
We gradually expose you
to your fear,

13:47.652 --> 13:50.394
and the more you're exposed,
the less it affects you.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.527
What do you mean, expose me?

13:53.571 --> 13:55.225
Check your phone.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.882
No, not your janky flip phone,
you hippy.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.144
Your hospital phone.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.667
[phone buzzes]

14:04.278 --> 14:06.149
Why'd you send me
a picture of a ballerina?

14:06.193 --> 14:08.499
Scroll down.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.459
Oh, no way
that's a foot.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.896
Caleb, this works.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.637
I just texted you an
article explaining it.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.334
[phone buzzes]

14:17.378 --> 14:19.380
This isn't an article.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.035
Oh, this one's worse.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.995
So, what
brings you here?[sighs]

14:26.039 --> 14:27.997
Dr. Jacobs has
made it very clear

14:28.041 --> 14:29.651
that she doesn't want me
as her doctor.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.131
She doesn't listen to me,

14:31.174 --> 14:33.089
and she doesn't respect
my professional opinion.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.918
So, can you just transfer her
to another doctor?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.137
Ah, I can.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.529
Okay.And I won't.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.530
What?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.271
But she's impossible

14:41.315 --> 14:42.882
and-- forgive me
for speaking frankly--

14:42.925 --> 14:44.361
a real handful.

14:44.405 --> 14:47.321
I'm sorry.
We've all been thinking it.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.323
Dr. Kenney,
I am glad you ended up being

14:49.366 --> 14:51.107
the doctor assigned to her.

14:51.151 --> 14:54.154
Whereas Dr. Kutcher
would defer to Dr. Jacobs,

14:54.197 --> 14:56.896
and Dr. Sommers
and Dr. Gilani are--

14:56.939 --> 14:58.462
what's the word?--

14:58.506 --> 15:00.464
cowards.Yeah.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.945
I can clearly see
that you trust your instincts

15:02.989 --> 15:05.252
and are driven
to do what is right.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.297
Oh. Well, thank you.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.952
Too bad Dr. Jacobs
doesn't trust my instincts.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.214
Well, she should.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.346
[sighs]

15:12.389 --> 15:14.391
Back to your patient.

15:16.219 --> 15:19.048
[laughs]
Exposure therapy
is working.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.268
I'm okay
to look at photos.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.401
In other news, don't look up
"nasty feet" on the Internet.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.795
I'm getting some
weird pop-up ads.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.276
Great. We're even more slammed
now, and we need your help.

15:29.319 --> 15:32.453
Time to up the intensity so
you can actually treat a foot.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.976
And how do we do that?

15:34.020 --> 15:36.196
You need to come face-to-face
with your fear.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.545
Literally.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.763
Oh, no.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.243
Oh, yes, my friend.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.418
Oh, I don't think
I can do this.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.291
Yes, you can.
Just sit on the couch.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.293
I'll talk you
through each step.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.816
Now...

15:47.859 --> 15:49.078
[inhales]
Take a deep breath.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.080
[both inhale, exhale]

15:51.124 --> 15:52.908
You are totally safe.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.692
Be calm

15:54.736 --> 15:56.999
as my calcaneus and cuboid
head toward you

15:57.043 --> 15:58.914
but remain in the periphery.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.569
I'm coming closer,

16:01.612 --> 16:03.223
but everything is fine.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.616
I'm slowly engaging
my extensor muscles

16:05.660 --> 16:07.967
so you can sense the movement.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.057
Are you ready for me
to move closer?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.233
I think so.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.589
I can feel the heat.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.246
Now...

16:26.289 --> 16:28.248
take a deep breath.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.337
[inhales deeply]Whenever you're ready,

16:30.380 --> 16:31.991
turn and look.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.514
You've got this.

16:33.557 --> 16:37.213
Three, two,

16:37.257 --> 16:38.214
one.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.563
I'm doing it.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.263
Now I'm going to wiggle.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.834
You started
without me?

16:51.532 --> 16:53.403
[knocking]

16:55.101 --> 16:56.624
Hi, Dr. Jacobs.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.756
We got the results
of your CT scan.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.715
The charley horse
was actually a blood clot.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.934
It is not large enough
to warrant surgery,

17:02.978 --> 17:04.980
so we'll just treat it
with a course of anticoagulants.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.112
All right.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.939
I know you want
to say it.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.332
Go ahead.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.812
"I told you so"?

17:10.855 --> 17:13.510
That's not what
I want to say.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.382
I do want to know...

17:15.425 --> 17:18.385
why you don't respect
me as a doctor.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.127
It-it's fine
if you don't like me personally.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.346
It's bewildering.
Everybody likes me.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.478
I'm universally...

17:24.521 --> 17:25.566
Dr. Kenney.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.525
Why do you think
I don't respect you?

17:28.569 --> 17:29.961
Oh, let's see.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.486
Today, you fought
me at every step,

17:32.529 --> 17:35.402
lied to me and refused to
take my medical advice.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.319
Dr. Kenney, today
was not about you.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.972
Today was about...

17:41.016 --> 17:43.497
how I am perceived
in this hospital.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.500
Okay.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.067
Is that all I get?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.547
I am a black, female physician.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.071
And in case you haven't noticed,

17:52.114 --> 17:53.855
there aren't
that many of us here.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.465
I have noticed.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.640
N-Not that I've been counting.

17:56.684 --> 18:00.470
I've been a-appropriately aware.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.732
Go on.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.083
I have to outperform
everyone around me

18:04.126 --> 18:06.259
just to get the same
basic level of respect

18:06.302 --> 18:08.565
that most doctors get
by walking in the door.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.393
If Dr. Frost makes a mistake,

18:10.437 --> 18:12.526
he's just one man
making one mistake.

18:12.569 --> 18:16.095
No one's gonna doubt
white men can be good doctors.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.009
They really have
to try to fail.Mm-hmm.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.794
Dr. Whitman is still
a surgeon here,

18:19.837 --> 18:23.580
and he left a
washcloth in somebody.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.582
But if Dennis or I
make a mistake,

18:25.626 --> 18:28.498
suddenly, black people aren't
qualified to be in medicine.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.544
[exhales]
Wow. You are so on it

18:30.587 --> 18:33.547
that I'd never imagine
that you'd feel that pressure.

18:33.590 --> 18:37.159
So it's not that I didn't want
to be taken care of by you.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.075
I didn't want to be
taken care of by anyone.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.556
I don't have the luxury
of appearing weak.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.558
You ran a marathon
and then came to work.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.604
I don't think anyone in this
hospital thinks of you as weak.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.606
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.434
[sighs]
Okay. I hear you.

18:51.478 --> 18:54.089
I will order
that heparin.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.613
Dr. Kenney,

18:56.657 --> 19:00.139
I would not have let you treat
me if I didn't respect you.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.620
I actually think
you are a very good doctor.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.405
Really?

19:05.448 --> 19:06.884
[exhales, sniffs]

19:06.928 --> 19:08.190
Thank you.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.497
And can you
say that again

19:10.540 --> 19:12.760
and just let me
get my phone out?

19:12.803 --> 19:14.675
Are you trying to record me?

19:14.718 --> 19:16.416
Yes. Yes.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.678
And...

19:17.721 --> 19:18.766
Oh, what is my password?[groans]

19:18.809 --> 19:20.115
Okay. Okay.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.030
I'm only going to say this
one more time.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.031
Okay. I'm ready.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.686
I think you're starting
to do well

19:25.729 --> 19:26.991
as a doctor.[camera clicks]

19:27.035 --> 19:28.515
Damn it. I took a picture.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.827
Guys, a lot of these feet
aren't bad.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.221
I don't even want to know what
you guys were doing today.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.657
We were trying
to make him better.

19:40.701 --> 19:41.963
We just ended up
making him weirder.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.138
[chuckles]

19:43.182 --> 19:46.359
Man, I am glad
this day is over.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.447
Uh, guys,

19:47.490 --> 19:48.883
we're not done yet.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.841
We got one more
coming from the ER.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.234
[groaning]Are you kidding?

19:52.278 --> 19:54.845
Nine hours? Who's still running
the marathon?

19:54.889 --> 19:56.847
[elevator bell dings]

19:57.892 --> 19:58.893
DANIEL:
Oh.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.982
It's one
of Carol's friends.

20:01.025 --> 20:04.072
[laughter]

20:05.116 --> 20:08.250
Ha-ha. Very funny.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
Carol?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.474
Mitch!

20:14.517 --> 20:16.040
It's my guy from H&R Block.
