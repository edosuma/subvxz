[birds chirping]

00:29.267 --> 00:31.200
[David panting]

00:51.867 --> 00:52.833
[Phil] David.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.500
[panting]

00:54.533 --> 00:55.767
[Phil] David!

00:57.800 --> 01:01.233
Where have you been?
I've been calling and calling.

01:01.267 --> 01:05.333
-What's happened?
-I didn't know you were
getting a copy delivered.

01:07.733 --> 01:10.033
-Jack beat me to it.
-Oh.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.700
-[door closes]
-Jack.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.167
Jack, listen.
Listen to me. Look...

01:24.200 --> 01:27.600
-Stay away from us, alright?
-No, no, listen.
I shouldn't have done this.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.633
I shouldn't have done this,
but everything
that this man wrote,

01:29.667 --> 01:31.800
it's all lies, it's all twisted
and exaggerated.

01:31.833 --> 01:34.100
What, so Mum wasn't
having affairs, then?

01:34.133 --> 01:36.267
-She wasn't suffocated
by family life?
-No, no, not-- Listen.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.267
Not in the way [stammers]
that he suggests.

01:38.300 --> 01:43.067
-Why would you even talk to him?
-Because I was desperate.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.400
Damn! I don't have
a bloody penny to my name.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.167
I owe people money, Jack,
alright?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.233
I owe your Uncle Phil,
I owe... [exhales]

01:55.467 --> 01:58.767
-I wanted to do things
with you two.
-Don't blame us.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.700
We didn't ask
to be humiliated like this.

02:00.733 --> 02:02.167
Ro, come on, we're going!

02:02.200 --> 02:03.533
-Listen, listen, listen!
-Jack!

02:03.567 --> 02:06.500
Okay, your mum,
she struggled.

02:06.533 --> 02:10.433
She struggled with this place,
[stammers]
and she struggled with me.

02:10.467 --> 02:13.533
And sometimes I think she felt
like she-- she thought her life

02:13.567 --> 02:16.567
could have turned out
differently.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.600
But the one thing
that she never regretted
was having you two.

02:20.633 --> 02:26.167
Okay, you were
the brightest stars
in her entire life.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
I'm so sorry for everything
that you've been through,

02:28.633 --> 02:30.567
and you didn't deserve
any of it.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.733
You two are the only innocents
in this, this whole mess.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.700
[David exhales]

02:40.600 --> 02:42.333
So, please...

02:44.200 --> 02:47.733
Don't listen...
Don't listen to these lies.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.733
[theme music playing]

03:08.500 --> 03:11.233
[phone ringing]

03:11.267 --> 03:13.733
So, Tom Wilson, where are we
with his first wife?

03:13.767 --> 03:17.100
She's clammed up on us.
She doesn't want to cooperate.

03:17.133 --> 03:20.100
Make her. Threaten her
with obstruction if you have to.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.700
We need to know
what sort of a man he was,
what he liked to do.

03:22.733 --> 03:26.233
Would he have owned equipment
used in the disposal
of Tara's body?

03:26.267 --> 03:29.533
-Did you speak to the DVLA?
-Hmm, they confirmed
the Moffatts only had one car

03:29.567 --> 03:31.500
registered in their name
at the time of Tara's death.

03:31.533 --> 03:35.067
And we know Alice
walked into town every day,

03:35.100 --> 03:37.567
so we can assume that Rob
used the car for work.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.133
He would have had
ropes, tarpaulin,
tools in the back.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.133
Tom Wilson,
on the other hand,

03:43.167 --> 03:45.533
he left the Collins house
on foot that night,

03:45.567 --> 03:47.733
so he might have encountered
Tara at the station.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.633
If he attacked her, he would
have had to conceal the body,

03:50.667 --> 03:55.100
source a car
and the necessary gear before
returning to dispose of her.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.333
-The timing's tight.
-Yeah.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.033
We need to get the Moffatts
back in, separately this time.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.800
-[Beckton] Right, boss.
-[Mari Luz] Right, boss.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.667
[Tom] I'm surprised you have
the nerve to come back.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.833
After what you did.

04:08.867 --> 04:12.833
That was our baby, Melissa!
Our future!

04:12.867 --> 04:16.333
-You didn't have the decency--
-Don't you dare talk to me
about decency!

04:16.367 --> 04:18.633
I've done nothing wrong!
How many times...?

04:18.667 --> 04:21.333
You sent
an innocent man to jail.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.400
You slept with his wife.

04:23.433 --> 04:26.033
You paid Louise
to cover for you.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.800
And you lied.

04:27.833 --> 04:31.267
You lied to my face
again and again.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.767
I was just trying
to protect you.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.533
You are a coward, Tom.
And a fantasist.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.500
You keep telling yourself
that it's my fault.

04:40.533 --> 04:44.267
But you destroyed our family,
no one else.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.600
[David] Right, then.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.133
-Okay.
-Do you want to come in?

05:12.167 --> 05:14.400
No one's here, so...

06:12.567 --> 06:15.100
Do you like living here?

06:15.133 --> 06:16.500
Yeah, it's fine.

06:21.567 --> 06:24.133
Have they been good to you?

06:24.167 --> 06:27.733
You always felt loved
and looked after?

06:27.767 --> 06:31.200
-Yeah.
-And safe?

06:31.233 --> 06:33.100
Have you always
felt safe here?

06:35.767 --> 06:39.800
You don't... You don't think
they could have had something
to do with Mum's death?

06:42.500 --> 06:47.300
I don't know.
I really don't know.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.400
[computer beeping]

06:52.433 --> 06:55.567
The night Tara died,
you two argued about money.

06:55.600 --> 07:00.767
We wanted to pay her back,.
Of course we did, we just...

07:00.800 --> 07:03.067
we just couldn't.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.233
-Had she asked for it back?
-Yeah.

07:06.267 --> 07:08.767
-When?
-That night.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.667
She was thinking
about her life post-divorce.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.233
But she knew
you didn't have the money.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.400
What were you gonna do?
Sell your car? Sell your flat?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.767
She wanted your flat?

07:22.800 --> 07:27.600
She said if we didn't have
the cash, we'd have to sell it.

07:27.633 --> 07:31.733
Your own sister was gonna...
throw you out on the streets...

07:33.800 --> 07:35.800
even though
she had plenty of money.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.300
I think she thought I was...

07:38.333 --> 07:41.200
I'd taken advantage of her.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.533
Is that why
you assaulted her?

07:46.067 --> 07:48.333
She was just being so cruel.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.200
Did you kill her, Alice?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.533
No.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.333
Did you want to kill her?

08:02.733 --> 08:05.833
For a second, maybe, yeah.

08:05.867 --> 08:09.267
Did you tell Rob
how you felt?

08:09.300 --> 08:11.133
That night,
before he went out,

08:11.167 --> 08:13.500
did you tell him
how you felt about your sister?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.133
Yeah, I did.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.600
I did.

08:27.767 --> 08:31.600
[birds chirping]

08:31.633 --> 08:34.567
-[indistinct chattering]
-[scanner beeping]

08:38.367 --> 08:40.400
[Will] Not sure I see
the point in that.

08:42.133 --> 08:45.133
You get all that money
selling your story,

08:45.167 --> 08:47.533
and you blow it
buying the papers back.

08:49.867 --> 08:53.333
Strange you never mentioned
any of this at the time,

08:53.367 --> 08:55.667
your wife shagging
your best friend.

09:01.767 --> 09:04.800
I bet that drove you mad,
didn't it?

09:04.833 --> 09:08.200
Knowing he was giving her
what you couldn't.

09:08.233 --> 09:11.567
Is that why you did it?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.067
-Is that why you took
a hammer to her?
-[snickers]

09:14.100 --> 09:16.133
Smashed her skull in.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.567
I know
you killed her, David.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.500
Why don't you just
get it off your chest?

09:35.600 --> 09:39.500
-She told me they argued, yes.
-[Cathy] What about?

09:39.533 --> 09:42.300
Tara refused to pay
for another round of IVF.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.533
Thought it was
a waste of money.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.233
-Anything else?
-Such as?

09:47.267 --> 09:49.433
Did Alice say anything else
about the argument?

09:49.467 --> 09:52.567
Well, she was pretty wasted,
so, um...

09:52.600 --> 09:55.267
-Did she say
she hated her sister?
-No.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.333
-Did she say she wanted
to harm her sister?
-No.

09:57.367 --> 09:59.500
Did she say
she wished Tara was dead
or words to that effect?

09:59.533 --> 10:02.433
Of course not.

10:02.467 --> 10:05.533
[sighs] Look, she cried,
she vented a bit,

10:05.567 --> 10:08.633
and then
she took herself off to bed.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.100
And then you went out.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.800
And then I went out.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.067
My instinct
is he's lying about the row

10:18.100 --> 10:21.400
and about
his wife's state of mind.

10:21.433 --> 10:24.233
There was a point
where I wondered whether
they might be in it together.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.067
And now?

10:27.100 --> 10:29.600
I think Tara was
slowly driving Alice mad.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.467
I think she was
in a tough spot herself,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.467
and she was prepared
to take it out on her sister.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.100
Alice was on antidepressants,
she was heavily in debt,

10:36.133 --> 10:38.333
she was about to be thrown out
on the street.

10:38.367 --> 10:41.133
I think she would happily have
murdered her sister that night

10:41.167 --> 10:43.100
if the opportunity
had presented itself.

10:43.133 --> 10:46.267
-But Rob took the initiative?
-Yeah.

10:46.300 --> 10:50.300
I think he... saved her
from herself.

10:50.333 --> 10:56.300
He could see what was happening,
and he acted to protect her.

10:56.333 --> 11:00.533
He loved her deeply,
he still does.

11:00.567 --> 11:03.500
Keep him in custody.
Extend the hours if you have to.

11:03.533 --> 11:07.133
We need something concrete.
A witness, forensics,
a confession.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.233
-Yes, sir.
-We can't afford
to get this wrong.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.100
[Jack] You told us
that Dad beat Mum up.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.667
-And you said she was terrified.
-That is what your mum told me.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.033
But did you ever see him
hit her?

11:19.067 --> 11:20.833
Please, Jack, come on.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.500
It's okay.
You can answer the question.

11:23.533 --> 11:27.233
No, I didn't. But she had marks
on her, you know.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.300
-A fractured cheekbone.
-Which has nothing to do
with our dad.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.667
Which we now know has nothing
to do with your dad, yes.

11:31.700 --> 11:35.133
You stood up in court,
and you swore
that he attacked her.

11:35.167 --> 11:39.133
-I'm not stupid.
I've read the reports.
-I know. [sobs]

11:39.167 --> 11:41.833
And I was wrong
that I helped to convict David.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.200
But, at the time, I absolutely
believed what I was saying.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.367
-Did you?
-Yes, I did.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.667
Your mum told me
that your dad hit her,

11:49.700 --> 11:52.133
she wanted to leave him,
it all just added up.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.833
I thought that he was
responsible for her death,

11:54.867 --> 11:58.200
-and I wanted to see
that he paid for that.
-Well, then, what about now?

11:58.233 --> 12:00.067
-I really don't know.
-Who do you think
is responsible now?

12:00.100 --> 12:03.133
-[knocking on door]
-[sobs]

12:03.167 --> 12:06.167
[knocking on door]

12:11.100 --> 12:14.433
South Downs Police.
Warrant to search the premises.

12:21.167 --> 12:25.200
I'd like to up
your dosage of FSH.

12:25.233 --> 12:28.433
-But if that doesn't work...
-[woman] Mrs. Wilson!
You can't go in there!

12:28.467 --> 12:30.367
For God's sake, Louise.
I am with a patient.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.700
We need to talk.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.133
I'm sorry. Would you give us
a moment, please?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.533
I had the police round today.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.600
They wanna charge me
with obstruction of justice.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.267
-Why?
-Because I lied for you.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.833
Do you know what you get
for obstruction? Two years.

12:50.867 --> 12:54.500
-Well, I'm sure
it won't come to that.
-Won't it? They charged you.

12:54.533 --> 12:58.633
Perverting
the course of justice,
according to D.C. Beckton.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.300
What are the kids gonna think
when their mum and their dad

13:01.333 --> 13:04.033
are charged
with a criminal offence?

13:04.067 --> 13:07.167
-I'll do all that I can to help.
-I need money for a lawyer.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.700
A good one.

13:10.533 --> 13:12.033
So, that's what this is about.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.800
Oh, you owe me, Tom.
Big time.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.600
I owe you nothing.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.233
You've had more
than your pound of flesh
from me.

13:17.267 --> 13:20.033
I'm not gonna let you
ruin my life.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.367
Ruin your life? Oh, yeah,
you've really suffered,
haven't you?

13:23.400 --> 13:27.367
What with the house
and the holidays
and with my kids!

13:27.400 --> 13:29.367
Yeah,
you've really had it bad.

13:29.400 --> 13:34.267
You have been leeching off me
for years, but it stops now!

13:34.300 --> 13:36.733
-You're hurting me!
-I have done everything
you asked.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.767
And what did you do
in return?

13:38.800 --> 13:42.467
You told my wife
to abort our baby.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.100
You don't get another penny
out of me for as long as I live.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.067
Now fuck off!

14:01.833 --> 14:05.067
[indistinct chattering]

14:17.767 --> 14:18.800
[man] Sarge?

14:25.400 --> 14:28.167
[Cathy] I don't think
you're a bad man, Rob.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.467
I'm sure you regret
what you did to Tara.

14:31.500 --> 14:36.333
I think you found Tara
that night.

14:36.367 --> 14:41.467
And in that moment,
at that time, your actions
made perfect sense.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.733
Because Alice
had already told you
she wanted her sister dead.

14:45.767 --> 14:48.533
She'd given you
the go ahead.

14:48.567 --> 14:52.600
So you killed her.

14:52.633 --> 14:53.767
No.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.633
How long have you been using
Robertson and Carter tarpaulins?

14:59.667 --> 15:02.300
-What?
-We found one today
in your boatyard.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.500
The same make as the one
Tara's body was wrapped in.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.533
Everyone uses R&C tarps.

15:10.567 --> 15:14.167
It won't be hard for us
to check the dates, Rob.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.500
Okay? And the longer
you hold out...

15:18.533 --> 15:20.067
the worse it looks,

15:20.100 --> 15:23.567
so why don't you just do
the right thing?

15:25.833 --> 15:28.567
One word from you...

15:28.600 --> 15:31.133
and all that pain,

15:31.167 --> 15:35.333
all that uncertainty
just goes away.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.667
Tara will have justice,

15:37.700 --> 15:39.633
you will have
a clear conscience,

15:39.667 --> 15:44.500
and Alice and your family
will be able to move on.

16:13.767 --> 16:17.033
[Cathy]
He's refusing to cooperate,
so we arrested him.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.800
Hopefully, some time in custody
will encourage him
to reconsider.

16:19.833 --> 16:23.300
Could you be wrong about this?
Are you looking at anyone else?

16:23.333 --> 16:27.033
-No, we're not looking
at anyone else.
-Oh, okay.

16:27.067 --> 16:31.167
I know
it's difficult to take in,
but this is good news, David.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.100
-Yeah.
-[dog barks]

16:34.133 --> 16:35.800
Yeah, I think, um...

16:38.233 --> 16:41.533
Thank you, Cathy,
that's what I'm trying to say.
Thank you.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.533
Right, now
I'm gonna see my lawyer
about getting my kids back.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.100
Great.

16:55.633 --> 16:58.033
You can't kick me out.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.100
I built this bloody practice
from scratch.

17:00.133 --> 17:04.067
You wouldn't have
a single patient
if it wasn't for me.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.400
This place is built
on my reputation.

17:06.433 --> 17:09.800
-It's my name above the door.
-And there's the problem.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.367
The adverse publicity
surrounding the Collins case

17:12.400 --> 17:15.167
-has been hugely damaging
to this practice.
-It'll blow over.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.267
Will it? When you've already
been charged with perverting
the course of justice?

17:19.300 --> 17:22.133
You shouldn't believe
everything my ex-wife tells you.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.833
We don't, which is why
we rang the police earlier.

17:24.867 --> 17:28.533
In these circumstances,
it's our view that your
continued employment here

17:28.567 --> 17:30.700
is detrimental
to the business.

17:30.733 --> 17:35.167
So we're suspending you,
pending an official
internal investigation.

17:35.200 --> 17:39.167
Your patient list will revert
to me and your appointments
rescheduled.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.200
You will be required to leave
the building immediately.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.400
-Alice isn't here!
-I'm not here to see her.

18:27.433 --> 18:30.533
And she expressly said
no one was to see the kids
until she was back.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.167
[door closes]

18:33.200 --> 18:35.733
Jack?

18:35.767 --> 18:37.600
Rosie?

18:37.633 --> 18:41.567
-David? You can't be here.
-Jack?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.233
Rosie?

18:43.267 --> 18:45.533
-[woman]
What's David doing here?
-Jack?

18:45.567 --> 18:47.467
-Dad?
-Jack, listen.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.200
I need to speak to you
and your sister. Where is she?

18:50.233 --> 18:51.700
Talk to your lawyer.
He can get a message to him.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.833
Five minutes,
that's all I need.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.467
Listen,
if the situation changes,
if your husband is charged,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.133
-then you can arrange a visit.
-Please. Please.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.700
I just want to speak to him.

19:00.733 --> 19:04.467
There's nothing you can
do here, Alice. Go home.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.267
[woman]
Call the police, then.

19:09.300 --> 19:13.600
You'll know by now
that Rob has been arrested on...

19:13.633 --> 19:16.367
suspicion of murder.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.533
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what's gonna happen next

19:19.567 --> 19:23.100
or-or when he'll be charged,
or what that means,

19:23.133 --> 19:28.267
but what I do know
is that I do not want
either of you living here.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.200
And nothing is gonna happen
without your say so, but...

19:31.233 --> 19:34.500
I've instructed my lawyers
to apply for a, um,

19:34.533 --> 19:36.833
what's called
an "emergency custody order".

19:36.867 --> 19:42.400
Which means
you come and live with me
just until things have settled.

19:42.433 --> 19:45.800
Now if you say no,
I will accept that.

19:45.833 --> 19:49.633
But I do think
it is the best thing to do,
given the circumstances.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.433
So, what do you say?

19:54.467 --> 19:55.667
Hmm?

19:57.433 --> 19:59.733
Do you wanna come
and live with your old dad?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.567
There you go.
In you get. Seatbelt.

20:11.633 --> 20:12.733
No. No, no, no.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.233
No, no.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.400
David? David, please!

20:20.433 --> 20:23.233
Please, you can't just
take them! David, please!

20:23.267 --> 20:26.800
-It's already done.
Talk to your lawyers.
-No!

20:26.833 --> 20:29.767
Please, please!
No, no, no!

20:29.800 --> 20:34.833
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!
Rosie. Rosie. Rosie.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.200
[Alice sobbing]

20:36.233 --> 20:38.067
Rosie.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.067
[birds chirping]

20:41.100 --> 20:42.133
[dishes clinking]

20:44.567 --> 20:47.133
-There you go.
-Thanks.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.733
-Right, you got everything?
-Yeah.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.033
Good.

20:53.133 --> 20:56.233
[indistinct chattering]

20:56.267 --> 20:58.567
They hardly slept a wink.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.067
Rosie was crying
half the night.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.600
It's bound to take them
a while to adjust.

21:03.633 --> 21:06.500
I just wish we'd left
ten minutes earlier.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.067
You did the right thing.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.133
And... you got
what you wanted.

21:15.133 --> 21:17.067
So try to enjoy it.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.733
[printer whirring]

21:35.833 --> 21:39.700
-What time's the boss in?
-She's usually here by now.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.400
There's nothing to tell, sir.
These were entirely innocent.

21:56.433 --> 22:00.200
-He was upset,
I was reassuring him.
-That your job now, is it?

22:00.233 --> 22:01.800
Sometimes, yeah.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.667
How many times
have you met him on your own,

22:03.700 --> 22:05.733
away from the station?

22:05.767 --> 22:08.533
-A handful of occasions.
-Where?

22:08.567 --> 22:11.533
At a cafe, at his home,
on the pier.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.500
But only because I was trying
to build up trust with him,

22:13.533 --> 22:16.200
and there was no way I could
do that here at the station.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.200
You knew this had
to be done by the book,

22:18.233 --> 22:20.367
that we couldn't afford
any mistakes,

22:20.400 --> 22:23.367
and yet you choose to go
on a series of dates
with a key suspect.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.033
-They weren't dates.
-Well, that's what
they bloody look like!

22:27.067 --> 22:32.167
What do you think the press
would make of them? [sighs]

22:32.200 --> 22:35.367
-Do you have feelings
for Collins?
-No. Absolutely not.

22:37.067 --> 22:38.633
I feel sorry for him
because he was robbed

22:38.667 --> 22:40.467
of being a dad for seven years
because of us,

22:40.500 --> 22:43.167
and I am ashamed of what
this force has put him through.

22:45.133 --> 22:47.200
Which is why I'm going to have
to take you off the case.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.033
-That's not necessary, sir.
-Effective immediately.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.667
D.S. Garcia will assume
your role,

22:51.700 --> 22:54.567
and I expect the handover
to be smooth and swift.

23:29.767 --> 23:32.100
Rob Moffatt's records
were all over the place,

23:32.133 --> 23:34.767
so I went direct
to Robertson and Carter.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.333
The first time Rob Moffatt
bought tarpaulins from them

23:37.367 --> 23:39.400
was January 2010.

23:39.433 --> 23:42.067
Eight months
after Tara Collins was killed.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.133
Prior to that, he was
buying them from Humphreys.

23:45.167 --> 23:48.467
Yeah.
So, what do you wanna do now?

23:52.267 --> 23:54.333
[Will]
I never took any photos.

23:54.367 --> 23:57.167
-I know you're lying.
-Why would I do that?

23:57.200 --> 24:01.067
-To mess up my career.
-Oh, yeah. Hillman loves you.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.633
-Well, he's taken me
off the case, so...
-You're kidding.

24:04.667 --> 24:07.400
-Were you jealous or something?
-I would never go to him
like that.

24:07.433 --> 24:09.267
-I don't believe you.
-No matter how angry.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.633
You don't even have the balls
to own up to it, do you?

24:11.667 --> 24:14.167
-Oh, God.
-Wage your campaign
against David,

24:14.200 --> 24:17.767
and let your jealousy
mess up your career and mine.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.567
And I hope you can live
with the consequences, Will,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.000
because you won't be
seeing me or Jacob again.

24:23.500 --> 24:27.733
[door opens, closes]

24:27.767 --> 24:30.233
-[waves crashing]
-[birds chirping]

24:33.567 --> 24:35.700
-This won't be forever.
-Really, Dad, it's fine.

24:35.733 --> 24:39.667
Once things have
settled down a bit,
I'll look for somewhere bigger.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.167
You know?

24:42.733 --> 24:45.700
Maybe somewhere away
from Halesham.

24:45.733 --> 24:49.033
Somewhere a bit more exciting.

24:49.067 --> 24:51.833
We could even head up north,

24:51.867 --> 24:54.533
my old stomping ground.

24:54.567 --> 24:56.233
You get a lot more bang
for your buck up there.

24:56.267 --> 24:58.333
We can get somewhere
with a nice, big garden

24:58.367 --> 25:00.733
and a trampoline or...

25:00.767 --> 25:02.033
we could get some pets.

25:06.233 --> 25:08.600
We don't have to decide now.
I'm just thinking.

25:11.267 --> 25:14.233
I think a fresh start
is gonna be best for everyone.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.567
[cell phone buzzes]

25:52.600 --> 25:54.500
[sniffs]

25:54.533 --> 25:56.833
-Rob?
-They're not charging me.

25:56.867 --> 26:01.600
-What, it's over?
-Yeah, they've let me go, Alice.

26:01.633 --> 26:03.800
I'll come and get you, love.

26:03.833 --> 26:07.267
-Yeah. That'd be great.
Thank you.
-I'll be as quick as I can.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.733
-Okay. See you in a bit.
-Bye.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.167
Bye.

26:52.067 --> 26:54.333
I took a pill today, Rob.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.633
More than one, actually.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.067
Losing the kids, you know,
losing you.

27:06.100 --> 27:09.633
But if I was going to do it,
I wanted to be with them
at the end.

27:09.667 --> 27:13.100
[sighs]

27:13.133 --> 27:18.200
So, I was looking
at some photographs
of the kids...

27:18.233 --> 27:20.167
and us, all together.

27:23.433 --> 27:27.767
And what I saw there
was seven years
of happy memories.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.167
You know,
we're not bad people.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.533
We've done stupid things,
but we are not bad people.

27:39.433 --> 27:42.133
[siren wailing]

27:49.333 --> 27:51.100
Did he say
why he took the photos?

27:51.133 --> 27:54.700
No, he's denying it.
But that's Will all over.

27:54.733 --> 27:56.800
He'd swear black is white
to avoid admitting
he made a mistake.

27:56.833 --> 27:59.433
Oh, tell me about it.

27:59.467 --> 28:02.367
-Sorry, that was
kind of thoughtless of me.
-No, it's fine.

28:08.867 --> 28:11.000
So many lives affected
by that man.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.633
[dog barking]

28:18.667 --> 28:19.667
Cathy?

28:19.700 --> 28:21.133
[door closes]

28:24.767 --> 28:27.800
-Thanks for bringing us
up to speed.
-No worries.

28:27.833 --> 28:34.233
But, um, I think it's best
if we call time
on these visits now.

28:34.267 --> 28:37.200
I mean, you've been
very helpful, but, uh...

28:37.233 --> 28:40.733
-well, you're off
the case, so...
-Alright.

28:40.767 --> 28:44.733
And David needs to spend
some time with his kids now.

28:44.767 --> 28:46.367
I'm sure you understand.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.033
Is that is what David wants?

28:55.333 --> 28:58.067
-I'm sorry?
-Is it what he wants
or what you want?

29:01.533 --> 29:04.233
[stammers]
It's what's best for him.

29:04.267 --> 29:09.400
Well... maybe,
but David's an adult,
and if that's how he feels,

29:09.433 --> 29:13.667
-I'm sure he can tell me
face to face.
-Just stay away.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.467
Okay?

29:16.767 --> 29:18.600
We don't want you here.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.500
Just digging out
one of the tents for the kids.

29:39.533 --> 29:43.333
I'm going to show them
how to put it up.

29:43.367 --> 29:47.600
What were you talking
to Cathy about, by the car?

29:47.633 --> 29:49.467
Not a lot. Just, um...

29:49.500 --> 29:52.300
chatting about what happens now
with the case and that.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.700
Seemed a bit heated,
that's all.

29:55.733 --> 29:58.033
-Not really, no.
-Not really?

30:00.833 --> 30:03.533
-What's going on?
-[scoffs] Nothing.

30:03.567 --> 30:08.033
If you're not gonna tell me,
Phil, [stammers] I'll ask Cathy.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.133
I told her not to come round
here anymore.

30:10.167 --> 30:13.833
-Why?
-Do you even have to ask?

30:13.867 --> 30:15.533
[stammers]
She's a police officer.

30:15.567 --> 30:18.067
She's part of the force
that sent you down.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.067
Why would you want
to cosy up to her?

30:20.100 --> 30:23.300
Because she's nice, and she's
been very fair to me, and...

30:23.333 --> 30:25.633
-because I like her.
-I can see that.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.500
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You always did have
bad taste in women.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.400
Oi. Easy, Phil, alright?

30:31.433 --> 30:35.367
Which is why your big brother
has to look out for you.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.733
[David sighs]

30:37.767 --> 30:40.667
Cathy Hudson's trouble, mate.
Trust me.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.800
His brother?
I don't know, Cath.

30:48.833 --> 30:52.333
I know it's nuts,
but humour me.

30:52.367 --> 30:54.667
Philip Collins.

30:54.700 --> 30:58.733
He worked for your company
for a number of years
starting in May 2005.

31:00.633 --> 31:03.167
Okay, I get that,
but is there anyone else there

31:03.200 --> 31:05.700
who was working
for the company back then?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.100
Thank you.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.700
[clears throat]

31:13.733 --> 31:16.067
Mr. Robinson.
I'm D.S. Mari Luz Garcia.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.800
I'd like to talk with you
about Philip Collins, if I may?

31:19.833 --> 31:24.300
That's right.
Um, he started with you in '05,
I believe, and...

31:26.500 --> 31:29.300
Okay, I didn't realise that.
Um...

31:29.333 --> 31:30.833
Can you remember
why he was let go?

31:30.867 --> 31:33.000
[indistinct chatter]

31:35.067 --> 31:36.733
And can you remember when?

31:40.467 --> 31:42.267
[phone ringing]

31:48.733 --> 31:50.233
Right.

32:50.233 --> 32:52.600
How can this guy be so sure?

32:52.633 --> 32:54.567
This was years ago.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.233
Because it was
a disciplinary matter.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.633
Phil had taken off in
the company vehicle when he was
supposed to be in the office,

33:00.667 --> 33:03.833
and racked up
an extra 500 miles on the clock,

33:03.867 --> 33:06.267
and he refused
to explain himself
when his boss challenged him.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.733
-No.
-And then he was sacked

33:08.767 --> 33:11.267
less than a week
after Tara was murdered.

33:11.300 --> 33:15.167
Was there anything
about his behaviour
that struck you as suspicious?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.333
Anything you can remember?

33:20.700 --> 33:23.133
Well, he was around a lot,
but I...

33:23.167 --> 33:26.733
I thought
he was being supportive
and he had taken time off work.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.767
Maybe he didn't tell you
because he didn't wanna
burden you,

33:28.800 --> 33:32.433
-but we have to consider
other possibilities.
-It's... [sighs]

33:32.467 --> 33:37.133
Did you see him at all
in the days leading up
to Tara's murder?

33:37.167 --> 33:40.067
[sighs]
No, he was in Bolton.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.100
He was in Bolton on the day
that Tara went missing.

33:43.133 --> 33:47.433
Because Tara told me
that she was leaving me,
and... I was in bits.

33:47.467 --> 33:50.833
And then I called him
the next morning to tell him
that Tara was missing.

33:50.867 --> 33:54.233
And he was still there.
He was still there, so...

33:54.267 --> 33:57.200
No, [stammers]
it can't have been him.
It can't.

33:57.233 --> 34:00.267
His supervisor said
he left work suddenly
on the day Tara died.

34:00.300 --> 34:04.233
He took a phone call around 4:00
and then took off.

34:04.267 --> 34:06.133
-He was at work
the next morning...
-No, he couldn't have...

34:06.167 --> 34:08.433
...but looked a mess
and wouldn't say
where he'd been.

34:08.467 --> 34:11.667
And we think he called you,
and then he headed
back down this way.

34:11.700 --> 34:14.733
-Either to see you
or to confront Tara.
-Why? Why would he do that?

34:14.767 --> 34:16.700
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know, David.

34:16.733 --> 34:18.667
I don't know,
but we are gonna have
to question him.

34:18.700 --> 34:20.367
Ah, this is...

34:33.600 --> 34:38.067
The photographs
that were sent to your boss,

34:38.100 --> 34:39.800
Phil sent them.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.133
[indistinct chatter]

34:47.167 --> 34:50.733
-I'm so sorry, Phil.
-It doesn't matter.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.033
Alright?

35:32.067 --> 35:33.467
Dave?

35:44.867 --> 35:46.733
You taught me how to do that.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.733
-What's that, mate?
-The butterfly knot.

35:48.767 --> 35:50.700
You taught me how to do that.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.167
Strong as steel if done right,
you said. Do you remember?

35:53.200 --> 35:56.633
Yeah. Glad to see you're getting
ready the gear for our trip--

35:56.667 --> 36:00.300
They know, mate, they know.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.567
-Sorry?
-The police.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.600
They know that you...

36:04.633 --> 36:08.833
you weren't in Bolton
on the day
that Tara was murdered.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.700
Sorry-- Sorry, mate.
What are we talking about?

36:10.733 --> 36:12.767
They spoke
to your supervisor at DTT.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.267
Sam Robinson, is that it?

36:16.400 --> 36:19.367
He told them
why he had to let you go.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.200
You don't wanna go believing
that old bastard.

36:21.233 --> 36:22.767
They sent them the report.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.700
Apparently,
you drove 500 miles that day.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.300
Why? Where did you go?

36:31.333 --> 36:33.467
Where did you go?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
Did you go anywhere nice?

36:35.533 --> 36:39.000
-Did you go anywhere nice?
-I came down to see you.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.267
I told myself...

36:44.300 --> 36:46.100
I was coming down
to give you some moral support.

36:46.133 --> 36:51.167
But, actually, mate,
I came down to enjoy myself.

36:51.200 --> 36:56.100
[stammers] Do you know
what it's like being me?

36:56.133 --> 36:58.500
Eh? The older brother.

36:58.533 --> 37:00.667
The older brother...

37:00.700 --> 37:03.367
-who can't hold down a job?
-No, this is not
what this is about.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.367
That can't get a wife?

37:05.400 --> 37:08.533
Do you remember that look
my girlfriends gave me

37:08.567 --> 37:11.100
when I introduced them to you?

37:11.133 --> 37:13.633
It was the same look.

37:13.667 --> 37:16.633
-The same look Mum and Dad
always gave me.
-I swear to God, Phil.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.233
-Disappointment.
-Here we go. Hey.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.233
Like they'd made a mistake.

37:21.267 --> 37:23.767
I had that for years, mate.

37:23.800 --> 37:30.667
Years and years,
so I came down
to watch you suffer.

37:30.700 --> 37:36.200
Little bro with his big house
and lovely family was
in a spot of bother.

37:36.233 --> 37:40.267
His wife was walking out on him,
taking the kids with her,
his business was in trouble.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.433
To be honest, mate,
it was too good to miss.

37:46.267 --> 37:48.233
I'm not proud of meself.

37:49.533 --> 37:52.467
And don't get me wrong,
I am...

37:52.500 --> 37:55.667
[stammers]
I am a different man now,

37:55.700 --> 37:57.300
but back then... [sobs]

37:59.400 --> 38:01.500
You tell me
what happened, Phil.

38:04.233 --> 38:06.267
You tell me what happened.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.367
I swear to God.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.833
Traffic was a bitch.

38:15.867 --> 38:19.567
Took me ages to get down.
But then...

38:19.600 --> 38:23.533
then I'm driving,
I'm driving past the station,
and I see her.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.600
And she's pissed,
that's obvious enough.

38:28.633 --> 38:31.200
So I offered her a lift.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.267
I thought she'd say no.

38:33.300 --> 38:37.500
Tara always... always thought
I was a prick, but this time...

38:39.300 --> 38:42.500
this time, she hops in.

38:42.533 --> 38:44.300
And she goes for it.

38:44.333 --> 38:47.500
Slagging you off.
Slagging off her family.

38:47.533 --> 38:51.067
[stammers]
She actually called you...

38:51.100 --> 38:53.533
a worm.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.467
Always sticks in me memory
because I'd never heard...

38:56.500 --> 38:59.167
anyone call you that before.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.067
Then the next thing I know,
we're parked by your house.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.733
She says she's gonna sneak in
the back, but...

39:06.467 --> 39:09.733
she's not going anywhere.

39:09.767 --> 39:14.133
She's really
in the swing of it now...

39:14.167 --> 39:16.033
telling me what Tom Wilson
liked to do to her.

39:16.067 --> 39:18.300
No.

39:22.567 --> 39:25.767
And I can't resist.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.267
I see meself...

39:28.300 --> 39:31.833
having her
outside your posh house

39:31.867 --> 39:34.733
in my crappy van.

39:34.767 --> 39:37.100
So I touched her.

39:37.133 --> 39:39.500
I don't know
what I was expecting.

39:39.533 --> 39:41.400
A slap?

39:41.433 --> 39:43.500
A kiss?

39:43.533 --> 39:47.400
But [stammers]
she just sits there with this...

39:47.433 --> 39:49.133
weird expression on her face.

39:49.167 --> 39:54.400
Then she said...
she says, "I'm low, mate,

39:54.433 --> 39:58.067
but I'm not that low".

39:58.100 --> 40:02.833
I can still hear her,
slurring her words, that...

40:02.867 --> 40:07.233
[stammers] that fucking sneer
spread across her face.

40:07.267 --> 40:10.767
And then she's out the van
and then trotting up the path.

40:10.800 --> 40:14.100
Like-- Like it's all
a big joke.

40:15.833 --> 40:17.767
I don't remember thinking
about what I was doing.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.500
[stammers] I had some work tools
in the front well, and...

40:21.533 --> 40:23.333
I grabbed
a lump hammer, and...

40:26.800 --> 40:29.767
-Fucking--
-[grunts]

40:29.800 --> 40:32.367
She was my wife.
She was my wife!

40:32.400 --> 40:35.667
[sobs]

40:35.700 --> 40:37.833
I didn't mean to kill her!

40:37.867 --> 40:42.233
But that's me all over, innit?
I can't help
fucking things up!

40:42.267 --> 40:44.600
[sobbing]

40:44.633 --> 40:46.500
Seven years...

40:46.533 --> 40:48.433
and you just stood there!

40:52.600 --> 40:58.567
Dave. I've been trying
to make up for it.
You've got to believe me.

41:03.167 --> 41:05.167
What are big brothers for, eh?

41:07.200 --> 41:09.633
I'm sorry.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.233
[sniffles]
I'm sorry, Dave.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.633
I'm so sorry.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.767
I am. I'm sorry.

41:23.867 --> 41:25.700
[sobs]

41:49.100 --> 41:52.133
[Hillman] A 47-year-old man
has now been charged

41:52.167 --> 41:54.500
with the murder
of Tara Collins.

41:54.533 --> 41:56.833
I can confirm
that we're no longer
looking for anyone else

41:56.867 --> 42:00.167
in connection
with this crime.

42:00.200 --> 42:04.600
We are satisfied with the way
this investigation
has been conducted,

42:04.633 --> 42:08.300
and I would like to pay tribute
to D.I. Cathy Hudson
and her team

42:08.333 --> 42:11.067
for their unstinting efforts.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.467
I would also like
to take this opportunity

42:13.500 --> 42:15.800
to apologise
to the Collins family.

42:27.733 --> 42:30.633
You ready?

42:30.667 --> 42:32.633
-Yeah?
-Okay.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.767
-[man] Here you go, fella.
-Thanks. There you go.

43:53.367 --> 43:56.333
[Jack yawning]

43:56.367 --> 43:58.667
-Morning.
-[Jack] Are we there?

44:00.633 --> 44:01.800
Yeah. We're here.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.633
Ro, wake up.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.133
Jack? You alright?

44:31.167 --> 44:32.733
[sobs]

44:32.767 --> 44:34.533
Rosie!

44:36.333 --> 44:37.733
We decided to stay.

44:37.767 --> 44:41.200
[Alice and Rosie sobbing]

44:41.233 --> 44:43.700
Jack!

44:43.733 --> 44:45.700
[Alice laughing]

44:49.133 --> 44:51.667
I think we've all been
punished enough, don't you?

44:51.700 --> 44:53.667
I don't know what to say.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.467
I don't know what to say.
Thank you!

44:58.500 --> 45:00.400
Thank you!

45:04.567 --> 45:04.633
[Rob laughs]
