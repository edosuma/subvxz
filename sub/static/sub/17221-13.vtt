WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:02.070
.

00:02.103 --> 00:02.703
Flexors are so tight, Tedward.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.573
Do I need to set another
appointment with Thai Vicky?

00:05.606 --> 00:07.308
Yeah, or Thai Barbara.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.077
Thai--okay.
All right.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.344
Hey, good news, guys.

00:10.378 --> 00:13.247
Tippy is out of town,
so the leash is off.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.583
[laughs]
Not that there is a leash,

00:15.616 --> 00:17.318
per say, but if there was one,

00:17.351 --> 00:18.819
Daddy is not wearing it.

00:18.852 --> 00:19.853
Tippy finally leave you

00:19.887 --> 00:22.156
because you always
refer to yourself as Daddy?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.124
- [laughs]
- No.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.792
You and Tippy are usually
attached at the hip.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.826
You're gonna be okay
without her?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.329
Please.
My schedule is full.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.599
I have restaurants to try,
museum exhibits to check out.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.134
Mm.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.103
Daddy's gonna have
all kinds of fun with himself.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.137
Well, you know what they say.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.539
When the cat's away,
the mice will masturbate.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.241
[laughs]

00:40.274 --> 00:41.442
Judge Wright.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.311
I hear you wrapped up the
Smithfield case this morning?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.213
I did, yes.
I did.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.248
If you hear three more cases
by Thursday,

00:47.281 --> 00:50.418
you will be the youngest judge
ever to hit 1,000.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.352
Really?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.287
Right now,
Judge Spoleto holds the record.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.422
You'll knock him off his perch.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.090
Well, Spoleto's the devil.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.292
Anti-choice and pro-Prop 8.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.228
And he has a secret camp
where he hunts people.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.796
From what I hear.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.764
Tedward, come on.
You heard the man.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.199
I have to rule on three cases
by Thursday.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.234
Can we do it?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.235
- Yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.436
What's on the docket today?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.304
Good Samaritan Retirement Home

01:10.338 --> 01:13.341
versus Aphrodite's Nest
Gentlemen's Club.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.408
I am on that case.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.709
Don't expect me
to go easy on you

01:15.743 --> 01:18.279
because you're trying
to break this stupid record.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.149
Hey, can we go back
to Spoleto's "camp"?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.451
He invited me to dinner
next weekend.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.119
Y'all think I should go?

01:25.153 --> 01:26.120
[mouths word]

01:26.154 --> 01:27.121
'Cause I did buy a new shirt.

01:27.155 --> 01:30.124
[upbeat music]

01:30.158 --> 01:38.166
*

01:40.168 --> 01:41.169
[elevator bell dings]

01:41.202 --> 01:42.436
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.238
Big day coming up.
What'd you get Rebecca?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.574
- For what?
- She's trying her 1,000th case.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.409
Did you not read my newsletter,
Ted's Words?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.843
[sighs]
I mean, I do the Jumble,

01:49.877 --> 01:51.345
but I don't read
all the articles.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.780
Look, this is big, man.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.648
You need to nail it
with the perfect gift.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.483
Okay.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.650
Okay, well, you two
are weirdly close.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.387
You want to come with me,
help me find something for her?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.355
Yeah, but trust me,
she is tough to buy for.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.723
You need to put
your shopping pants on.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.824
We're going hard in the paint.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.858
All right.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.496
You will never guess
who Nick is dating.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.198
Is he dating
a personal pan pizza?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.332
'Cause that's
what I want for lunch.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.333
Carla Myers.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.335
Ew,
Carla from high school, Carla?

02:14.368 --> 02:15.636
- Yes.
- Ew.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.671
Yes, she's evil. She hates me.
She's always had it out for me.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.740
I think she's sleeping with Nick
just to spite me.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.375
That's ridiculous, Michelle.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.376
No, she's mean.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.711
God, don't you remember?

02:23.744 --> 02:24.878
Senior year, talent show.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.315
She had everyone
boo us off the stage.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.949
- And we were pretty good.
- We were good.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.950
Five, six...

02:29.983 --> 02:31.151
(both)
Seven, eight.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.687
(Rose Royce)
* At the car wash
whoa whoa whoa whoa *

02:33.721 --> 02:35.389
And then I rub wax,
and then I wax.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.457
And then I wax,
and then we go--

02:36.490 --> 02:37.591
And--and sit.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.661
Oh.

02:40.694 --> 02:41.462
(Rebecca)
Oh, my God.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.763
(Michelle)
Was it your back again?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.465
No, I just...

02:44.498 --> 02:46.534
I just saw my van.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.736
My van just pulled out
and drove down the street.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.538
No, your van died in the desert.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.605
No, it was murdered
in the desert.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.707
If something's murdered
in the desert,

02:53.741 --> 02:55.576
can it come back to life?

02:55.609 --> 02:58.246
No more NyQuil.
No more.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.882
Your Honor,
I just want you to know,

03:01.915 --> 03:02.983
I'm on your team.

03:03.016 --> 03:03.951
Between us chickens,

03:03.984 --> 03:05.686
I sometimes don't get down
every word in here,

03:05.719 --> 03:07.321
but when I heard
you might break that record,

03:07.355 --> 03:08.922
I popped, like, six Sudafeds,

03:08.956 --> 03:10.458
so I am ready to go.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.560
Okay, well,
that's good to know.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.561
Ready to go!

03:13.594 --> 03:14.695
Okay.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.231
Your Honor, the plaintiffs live
in a retirement home,

03:17.265 --> 03:19.333
and they are suing
to shut down the strip club

03:19.367 --> 03:20.734
that opened two doors down.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.002
On what grounds?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.339
Well, it's a Lutheran home, and
they hold daily prayer services,

03:25.373 --> 03:27.408
and so they get the same
protections as a church.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.876
And as a church,
the law says

03:28.909 --> 03:31.245
that strip club can't operate
within 1,000 feet of them.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.813
We're good down here.
Go, go, go.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.382
Pretty straightforward, Tom.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.483
Why don't you go ahead
and call your first witness?

03:35.516 --> 03:36.317
Uh, yes.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.319
We call
the Reverend Walter Jensen.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.321
Oh, boy.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.357
[groaning]

03:50.063 --> 03:52.266
[joints popping]

03:52.300 --> 03:54.335
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.336
Whenever you're ready.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.771
Yeah, no--
no, take your time.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.806
Come on!

03:58.839 --> 04:00.408
Uh--

04:00.441 --> 04:01.909
[groans]

04:01.942 --> 04:03.277
All right, touchdown.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.412
All right, well,
raise your right hand.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.413
- Do you swear--
- Hold it.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.348
If it's all the same to you,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.650
I'd prefer to use my own Bible.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.718
That's fine.
Go ahead.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.986
Criminy.
It's back at the table.

04:13.020 --> 04:13.987
(Tedward)
Okay, yeah.
Where is it?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.022
Let me grab it.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.857
No, no, it'll be quicker
if I get it.

04:16.890 --> 04:20.361
- Tedward, just get--
- I know right where it is.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.062
There we go, there we go.
There we go. Yeah.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.564
There we go.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.699
Here we go.
That is...quick.

04:28.936 --> 04:29.069
.

04:29.102 --> 04:29.870
(woman)
And my daughter was visiting.

04:30.638 --> 04:34.375
Her new husband is
a heart surgeon.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.644
Oh, what is his name?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.479
It'll--it'll come to me.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.981
Anyway,
we took them to the cafeteria,

04:41.014 --> 04:44.718
and they were serving peas
again.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.454
Two days of peas.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.322
Now, that's just crazy.

04:48.356 --> 04:52.059
Ma'am, I'm so sorry, but I just
asked you to state your name.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.428
Oh, it's Mildred.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.029
- Mm-hmm.
- Mildred Belin--

04:56.063 --> 04:57.365
Thank you, Ms. Belin.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.968
No, no.
It's Belinikowski-Friedman.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.504
I was one of the first
to hyphenate.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.938
It's spelled

05:04.972 --> 05:10.611
B-E-L-I-N-I-K-O-W--

05:10.644 --> 05:12.746
Oh, that's not necessary.
Thank you.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.748
And I now see that
we are out of time.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.386
So we're gonna have to pick this
up first thing tomorrow morning.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.755
Hopefully we can get the address
by lunch.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.756
You guys...

05:22.790 --> 05:23.757
Hey.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.758
This is hopeless.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.360
I'm never gonna clear that case
fast enough

05:26.394 --> 05:27.828
to get in two more by Thursday.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.929
Hey.
Yes, you can.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.398
I believe in you.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.600
Oh, my God.
I almost forgot to tell you.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.902
I think I saw my old van
the other day.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.637
Yeah, Michelle and I
were having lunch,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.672
and it turned left
on Riverside.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.942
Rebecca,
that van was one of a kind.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.778
Okay, and destroyed
beyond repair, by the way.

05:44.812 --> 05:45.979
I saw that van.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.147
- Mm-hmm.
- I did.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.816
Yeah,
sounds like phantom van pain.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.151
Look, a thousand cases is
a big milestone, right?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.487
So it's natural that you would
look back over your career

05:53.521 --> 05:54.888
and the person you used to be.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.923
The van represents that.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.024
Hmm.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.026
Yeah, well, I'm never gonna make
that milestone now.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.797
I had a very old, geriatric,
slow-moving speed bump.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.698
Mm, hey.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.801
Why don't you take
a shift in night court?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.470
Tedward,
that is a brilliant idea.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.439
I can breeze through
three cases, no problem.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.440
[phone chimes]
- Yeah.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.907
Oh, man.
It's Michelle.

06:13.941 --> 06:14.908
She sounds drunk.

06:14.942 --> 06:15.909
In a text?

06:15.943 --> 06:16.777
Yeah.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.612
Five wine bottles
and seven sad faces.

06:18.646 --> 06:19.680
That's like her Bat-Signal.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.948
- Ooh.
- All right, I gotta bounce.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.516
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll see you. Bye.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.517
And I will see you...

06:23.551 --> 06:24.518
In night court.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.787
- Yes.
- [laughs] Later.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.056
Hey, you guys wanna catch
a flick with me tonight?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.924
I make my own caramel corn,
and I sneak it in

06:30.958 --> 06:33.827
in Tippy's Daughters of the
American Revolution tote bag.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.762
Oh, sorry, buddy.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.530
Tedward and I are
going shopping later.

06:36.564 --> 06:37.731
I mean, you're more than welcome
to join us

06:37.765 --> 06:39.132
if you have no one else
to hang out with.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.000
What? No.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.502
I got plenty of people
to hang with.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.503
I'll just call
one of my other friends.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.771
You know,
like my friend Ross.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.139
And, um, Monica's cool.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
Chandler.
God, could he be any funnier?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.877
Right, yeah, well, you know,
it's a--

06:49.910 --> 06:50.878
If you do want
to catch up later,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.646
maybe grab a beer with us,

06:52.680 --> 06:53.914
we'll be with Norm.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.883
- Oh, Cliff's gonna be there.
- Cliff. Cliff will be there.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.950
- Yeah.
- And Woody.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.819
Yeah, sure.
What place is this?

06:58.852 --> 06:59.820
Cheers.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.921
Cheers.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.494
Michelle.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.529
Get in the car.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.501
[sighs]

07:15.969 --> 07:17.871
What are you doing
in front of Nick's house?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.573
Do you remember when
Britney Spears shaved her head

07:19.607 --> 07:20.908
and just sat around on curbs?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
That's what you look like.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.712
Carla's in there with him
probably doing it.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.946
Michelle, I love you,

07:25.979 --> 07:27.014
but I have
to get to night court,

07:27.047 --> 07:28.115
so you have one minute
to spill.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.082
Okay, okay.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.084
Remember in high school
I liked Kyle Peterson?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.786
- Yeah.
- And then Carla told me,

07:32.820 --> 07:34.688
"He's never gonna date you
because you're not pretty."

07:34.722 --> 07:35.823
You're gorgeous,
and Carla just said that

07:35.856 --> 07:36.857
because she wanted
to sleep with him.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.025
Which worked,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.793
and now she's in there
doing it with Nick.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.695
You know?
She always gets what she wants.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.131
And I hate her,
and I have a plan this time

07:44.164 --> 07:45.666
'cause I'm gonna
punch her in the face.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.568
We're grown-ups,
punching is now called battery,

07:47.601 --> 07:48.802
and they will
take you to jail for it.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.504
- Crap.
- Yeah.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.572
I know.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.173
I know, I gotta let this go.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.942
Mm-hmm.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.743
I just--I want--

07:55.776 --> 07:57.911
I just wanna sit here
for a second.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.781
Just, will you just hold me?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.683
This is nice.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.717
(Tedward)
Gary, we've been to five stores.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.918
We have to find something here.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.053
I know, I know.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.156
I-I need to find something
meaningful but unconventional.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.992
Oh, you mean like a fancy
slow cooker that plays music.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.193
Is that real, or are you just
making that up?

08:13.226 --> 08:16.697
I think I just made that up,
but the technology does exist.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.865
Oh, you know what?
What about a locket?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.568
You know, and we can put our--
put our pictures in it.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.569
A locket?

08:21.602 --> 08:22.570
Yeah.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.771
What is it, 1892?

08:23.804 --> 08:24.905
What, are you going out to sea
for six months?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.306
I don't know.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.075
What about, like,
an expensive scotch, you know?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.577
Play it safe.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.678
The woman
has enough alcohol.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.913
If anything, get her a bottle
of water and some Advil.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.847
[sighs]

08:33.881 --> 08:35.248
I don't know.
I'm in my head, you know?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.717
There's a lot of pressure
on this.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.985
- Yeah.
- She's hard to shop for.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.052
I mean,
if I was shopping for you,

08:39.086 --> 08:41.021
I would know exactly
what to get.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.824
This leather jacket.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.693
This jacket is so me.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.694
Yeah.
You know what?

08:46.727 --> 08:47.795
Why don't you just try it on?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.262
No, I shouldn't.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.864
Pop this baby on.
Come here.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.199
[stammers]

08:52.232 --> 08:54.301
Yeah, come on.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.269
Oh.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.070
Butter.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872
Yeah, it is like
it was made for you.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.340
You know,
it's my 1,000th case too.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.341
Really?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.744
No, but look how happy
it makes me.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.012
We should find a mirror.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.049
Wow.
Rough crowd, huh?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.118
Looks like the emergency tent
at Coachella.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.586
Yeah, don't worry, okay?
I had them

09:12.620 --> 09:14.221
crank up the sensitivity
on the metal detectors.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.288
- Mm.
- Same setting they use

09:15.322 --> 09:16.289
for The Source Awards.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.290
Mm-hmm.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.291
Mm-hmm.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.226
Mr. Wheeler,

09:19.259 --> 09:21.995
you are accused
of flashing a city bus.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.597
So let's just
cut to the chase.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.633
Are you wearing any clothes
under that trench coat?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.736
- Oh.
- All right, all right.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.003
A simple "no"
would have sufficed.

09:30.037 --> 09:34.107
Guilty.
Maximum probation and fine.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.710
Yeah, okay, I got it.
Hit the gym.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.781
Well, I'm inclined to be lenient

09:40.814 --> 09:42.916
because, let's face it,
who hasn't been there?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.018
Passed out on a fire escape
in your underwear?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.020
No?
Just me?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.288
Well, either way,

09:48.321 --> 09:50.057
one week community service
for you, sir.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.058
Next.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.359
Here it is, Judge.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.996
Case 1,000.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.831
Okay.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.999
Oh, simple DUI.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.333
Hmm.
Some say boring.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.334
I say it's a classic.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.402
Mm-hmm.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.171
Mr. Kreitz,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.373
it says here
that you blew a .18?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.208
I've had nothing
to drink tonight, Your Honor.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.044
Yeah? Then how do you explain
your Breathalyzer results?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.346
I'm a magician
and a fire breather.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.916
No way.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.284
I use alcohol to breathe fire,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.852
which is why it registers
on the test.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.954
I was driving home from my show,
and I got pulled over.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.189
Oh, okay, well,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.891
I guess the only way
we're gonna find out

10:23.924 --> 10:24.758
if you're telling the truth
or not

10:24.792 --> 10:27.094
is if you demonstrate
your act for us.

10:27.127 --> 10:27.895
- Huh?
- Yeah.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.096
- My pleasure, Your Honor.
- Yeah?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.665
[crowd chatter]

10:33.801 --> 10:37.437
[crowd gasps and cheers]

10:37.470 --> 10:39.940
- Aah!
[fire alarm blaring]

10:39.973 --> 10:41.675
No, no, no, no, wait.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.843
Oh, no.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.044
Guys!

10:44.077 --> 10:46.346
Guys, it's just a little mist.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.882
Please don't go.
I have to close this case!

10:48.916 --> 10:50.984
Tedward!

10:51.018 --> 10:53.020
He was good, though.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.059
.

10:59.092 --> 10:59.559
All right.
This is it.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.162
- [sighs]
- You gotta wrap this up today.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.363
Otherwise,
Spoleto keeps his record.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.331
I know.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.733
- Okay.
- Good luck.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.467
(Rebecca)
All right, Tom, here's the deal.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.303
I'm imagining
the rest of your witnesses are

11:10.337 --> 11:12.706
gonna have similar complaints
about noise,

11:12.740 --> 11:15.709
moral outrage,
and overabundance of peas.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.077
Ah,
now they're also worried that

11:17.110 --> 11:19.847
the strippers might cause
a shortage of $1 bills,

11:19.880 --> 11:20.680
so they'll have nothing
to put

11:20.714 --> 11:23.116
into their grandkids'
birthday cards.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.953
Right, so,
if we let the court show

11:25.986 --> 11:28.088
that all of your plaintiffs'
complaints are logged in,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.222
will you move on?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.223
I think that--

11:30.257 --> 11:32.325
Great.
Defense, you're up.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.963
Your Honor, Aphrodite's Nest is
an upscale supper club.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.430
To prove that,
I'd like to call a waitress

11:37.464 --> 11:40.333
who's worked there
over a year.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.135
- Ooh.
- [chuckles]

11:42.169 --> 11:43.136
[man whistles]

11:43.170 --> 11:44.304
- [clears throat]
- Whoo-hoo!

11:44.337 --> 11:45.305
I got it.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.374
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.212
Raise your hand
and state your name, please.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.847
Apollonia Lavender.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.382
Apollonia Lavender?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.517
That's--that's really your name?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.019
- Yes, it's my only name.
- Really?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.253
- Yeah, really.
- Okay.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.255
We're gonna need some sort of
birth certificate or an ID or--

12:02.289 --> 12:03.190
Fine, fine.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.391
Do you have some sort
of legal document

12:04.424 --> 12:05.425
saying that that's her name?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.427
Your Honor, she's from Siberia.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.529
It will take a few hours to get
the documents telefaxed.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.331
All right, well--telefaxed?

12:11.364 --> 12:13.967
Jeez, you guys really did quit
after the Space Race.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.136
All right, two-hour recess.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.005
I need those documents
within that two-hour window,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.372
not a second later.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.942
Hey, do you want to maybe catch
some lunch?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.243
Uh, no,
I'm having lunch with Mich.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.778
Oh, cool, cool, cool, yeah.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.546
I like to eat alone.
It gives me a chance to eat...

12:26.579 --> 12:28.415
by myself.
Hey, did you want to--

12:28.448 --> 12:29.416
Nyet.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.453
Thank you.
This is a lovely restaur...

12:33.486 --> 12:36.456
[clears throat]
Great.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.025
Hi, yeah, can I get the, um...

12:38.058 --> 12:38.992
Oh, you're just...

12:39.026 --> 12:40.193
You know what,
you can leave one of those.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.328
That's...

12:41.361 --> 12:42.429
Wow, that is empty.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.130
[laughs]

12:43.163 --> 12:44.832
No, I'm just--I'm dining alone,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.466
but my choice.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.434
[laughs]

12:47.467 --> 12:49.837
Oh, seriously.
The chairs?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.305
Oh, so you found something?

12:52.339 --> 12:55.442
Well, not for her,
but I got something for you.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.443
No way.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.444
Yeah.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.246
Dude, this is perfect.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.148
I saw you looking at it
when we were shopping.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.482
I mean,
you always talk about writing.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.650
I figure this will be

13:03.683 --> 13:05.886
just the nudge you need
to push you in that direction.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.955
Look, Gary, you were supposed to
be buying a present for Rebecca.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.956
What happened, man?

13:08.989 --> 13:09.990
I don't know.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.158
I'm kind of freaking out,
Tedward.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.126
I mean,
is there something wrong with me

13:13.160 --> 13:15.562
that I can't find a present for
this woman I supposedly love?

13:15.595 --> 13:16.563
No, man.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.697
You could look forever

13:17.730 --> 13:20.300
and probably never find
the exact, right, perfect thing

13:20.333 --> 13:22.836
to commemorate
this huge milestone in her life.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.208
Go, go, go.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.877
Oh, my God,
everything looks good,

13:29.910 --> 13:30.878
and I'm starving.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.744
Mm, I know.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.180
Well,
I wanted to treat you to lunch

13:33.213 --> 13:34.381
to say thanks for, you know,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.016
talking some sense into me
the other day.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.417
You were totally right,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.386
and I have completely moved on.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.587
That is great.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.289
Michelle, honestly,
I'm really proud of you.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.124
You don't need
to sink down to Nick's level

13:44.157 --> 13:46.960
and get involved
in some petty old feud with--

13:46.994 --> 13:48.361
Is that Carla Myers?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.197
What?
She works here?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.498
[gasps]
She got fat.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.533
I cannot believe you dragged me
halfway across town

13:53.566 --> 13:55.335
to come spy on her with you.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.405
I told you, I don't want to do
this petty, high school crap.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.506
Hey...

13:59.539 --> 14:00.507
Carla.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.375
I haven't seen you
in a long time.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.544
Huh.
I just saw Michelle.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.214
She was lurking in the bushes
outside of Nick's house.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.982
Boy, you just couldn't wait
until Nick and I broke up

14:09.016 --> 14:09.749
to sleep with him.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.451
Oh, is the tomato soup
cream-based?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.385
What?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
What? We never get to eat
at these lunches.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.655
Well, I wouldn't eat
at this restaurant.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.157
Because if
she's touched anything,

14:17.190 --> 14:18.491
it definitely has herpes.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.559
Okay, listen,

14:19.592 --> 14:21.128
why don't we bury this?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.562
Yes.
That's a great idea.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.332
Here, why don't you have
a margarita on the house?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.566
Oh, thank--aah!

14:26.599 --> 14:27.567
Aah!
Oh, my God!

14:27.600 --> 14:28.568
- Oh, no, okay.
- Bitch!

14:28.601 --> 14:29.569
It's okay.
[shushing]

14:29.602 --> 14:30.637
Oh, listen, hey,
I didn't wait

14:30.670 --> 14:32.973
for you and Nick to break up
before I slept with him.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.341
We had sex
when you were married too.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.342
What?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.509
What?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.946
- Ooh!
- Oh!

14:38.979 --> 14:39.947
What a bitch!

14:39.980 --> 14:41.014
Yeah.
Oh, my God!

14:41.048 --> 14:42.015
- Aah!
- Oh!

14:42.049 --> 14:43.016
Oh, not today.
Please.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.184
You can't arrest me today.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.053
Oh, no, sir, I'm serious.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.054
Just listen to me.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.288
Be reasonable.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.090
Sir.

14:54.361 --> 14:54.561
.

14:54.594 --> 14:54.928
Rebecca, hey.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.965
- Oh.
- Oh, God, are you okay?

14:57.998 --> 15:00.167
No, I'm not okay.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.469
Gary is posting bail
for me right now.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.470
Ugh.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.005
How did you
find out about this?

15:05.038 --> 15:08.241
Your case is coming through
my office.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.143
Are you okay?
What's going on?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.678
Between punching
this person

15:11.711 --> 15:14.181
and this whole
thousandth case record--

15:14.214 --> 15:16.216
No, that's definitely
not happening now, so--

15:16.249 --> 15:18.551
So some jerk keeps his record.
Who cares?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.053
Why is it
such a big deal to you

15:20.087 --> 15:22.322
to be the youngest person
to a thousand?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.125
Maybe I like
the sound of it, okay?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.459
I'm 45 years old.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.196
I know, I don't look
a day over 38.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.630
All right,
but when's the next time

15:30.663 --> 15:34.167
I get to be
youngest anything anymore?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.969
All right,
I'm affected by that too.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.205
You know, my hair
is naturally gray.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.173
- Really?
- All of it.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.009
- Everywhere.
- Okay, I got it.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.510
- I dye it from my head down--
- I get it.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.378
- Okay.
- You know.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.180
It's hard, right?

15:47.214 --> 15:49.382
Well, they make a special dye
for your sensitive areas.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.651
No, I mean
one day you're young,

15:51.684 --> 15:54.187
driving around a cool van,
questioning authority.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.689
The next day, you are
the authority, the van's gone,

15:56.723 --> 15:58.725
and you find yourself
wandering around a CVS

15:58.758 --> 16:01.361
admiring shower stools,
thinking,

16:01.394 --> 16:04.164
"Hey, that's actually
a really good idea."

16:04.197 --> 16:05.298
Hey, you know what?

16:05.332 --> 16:08.435
The way I see this case--
total self-defense, right?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.637
Michelle's life
was in danger,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.106
and Carla was reaching
across the table

16:13.140 --> 16:16.376
trying to grab the corkscrew,
and you stepped in.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.211
Right?
They have no case.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.313
Tom, are you gonna make
this case go away for me?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.749
Let's just--okay, maybe
a little quieter with that

16:22.782 --> 16:24.651
in the police station.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.021
Wow.
That's really nice.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.156
Hey, wait.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.124
Am I the first person
that you've revealed this to?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.325
Yeah, why?

16:32.359 --> 16:35.595
Seems like the kind of thing
that you would tell a friend.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.630
Like, you're my friend,
and I'm your friend,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.132
and we are friends.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.567
- Well, yeah, but--
- Let's leave it at that.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.603
We've come to--let's agree
to agree that we're friends.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.806
Judge, you still got 20 minutes
to beat this record.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.776
No, it's over.
It just wasn't meant to be.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.178
[knocks]
Rebecca?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.645
Sounds like you had
quite a lunch.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.880
- Ay-yi-yi.
- Oh.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.616
Unfortunately, your stripper
case will have to be continued.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.219
The one fax machine
in Siberia is down until Monday.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.621
Oh, man.
What a crap day.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.723
Well, I'm just
gonna go home.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.125
- Yeah, looks good.
- Thank you.

17:05.158 --> 17:08.095
Actually, I need you
to cover a case for me.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.262
My wife has come down
with something,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.364
and I--I gotta go.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.101
All right, but don't
blame me if I go tough on him.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.235
I was in solitary.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.205
It was a private holding area,
'cause you're a judge.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.239
You don't know
what I've seen.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.274
I've changed.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.809
Mr. Brock is here
for committing fraud

17:22.842 --> 17:24.344
against Mastro's Steakhouse.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.345
Tom?

17:25.378 --> 17:28.415
Yes, uh, he allegedly
ordered the seafood tower,

17:28.448 --> 17:30.817
two bottles of wine,
two steaks with all the sides,

17:30.850 --> 17:31.718
and the pecan pie,

17:31.751 --> 17:35.122
and then he tried to leave
without paying.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.189
A dine and dash?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.857
Dine and dash.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.093
We actually might be able
to get through this

17:40.127 --> 17:41.194
pretty quickly.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.395
Uh, is it a strong case?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.131
40 witnesses in the restaurant.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.499
Instagram photos of him
with the seafood tower,

17:46.533 --> 17:48.468
and he was arrested
at the valet.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.203
- Allegedly.
- Tedward, can we do this?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.771
We got four minutes.
We can do this.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.772
- Tom?
- I'm in.

17:52.805 --> 17:53.573
Opening statement.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.375
He ate. He didn't pay.
He left. Done.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.210
- Oh, and the defense?
- Your Honor, I--

17:57.244 --> 17:58.645
- Objection.
- On what grounds?

17:58.678 --> 17:59.746
- We get it.
- Sustained.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.614
All right, the prosecution
would like to call Mr. Brock

18:01.648 --> 18:02.615
to the stand.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.650
All up here
to the stands.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.751
[claps]
You got two minutes!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.886
[overlapping chatter]
- Come on, come on, come on.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.221
Hey, hey, hey, whole truth,
nothing but the truth.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.156
He's good.
You got it?

18:09.189 --> 18:09.956
All right, that was a lot
of food to eat.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.057
Were you there
with someone else?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.860
Yes, I was on a date.
Why are you talking so fast?

18:13.893 --> 18:14.927
Did you order the food,
did you eat the food,

18:14.961 --> 18:16.129
did you pay for the food,
did you intend to pay

18:16.163 --> 18:18.198
for the food, did you leave
without paying for the food?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.600
Yes--no.
I don't know. What is happening?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.834
Think I got a confession
in there.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.403
- Prosecution rests.
- Tedward?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.172
- 30 seconds, Your Honor.
- All right, Mr. Brock.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.839
How about you pay back
the restaurant and I give you

18:26.873 --> 18:28.241
6 months' probation?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.143
- That sounds good.
- No. he doesn't agree.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.211
Too late.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.812
And, Mr. Brock, don't ever lie
to impress a girl.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.381
If she needs all that,
she's just not that into you.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.815
- Court adjourned.
- Time.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.816
[gasps]
I made it?

18:36.849 --> 18:37.917
Congratulations, Your Honor!

18:37.950 --> 18:40.920
[all cheering]

18:40.953 --> 18:42.922
1,000.
1,000.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.692
- Uh!
- Yes!

18:45.725 --> 18:48.628
[whistles]

18:48.661 --> 18:49.629
Whoo!

18:49.662 --> 18:50.430
[whistles]

18:50.463 --> 18:52.699
What?
Sir, what are you doing here?

18:52.732 --> 18:53.933
I thought your wife was sick.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.669
Well, I did what I had to do
to see that justice was served.

18:56.703 --> 19:00.173
If you didn't break that record,
it would have been a crime.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.508
I've got something for you.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.542
Oh, no, no, no.
Sir, I couldn't.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.743
You need that to trade with.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.478
[laughs]

19:05.512 --> 19:06.913
I didn't always wear bolos.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.649
I got this from Judge Carlton
when I hit a thousand cases,

19:09.682 --> 19:11.884
and I've been wearing them
ever since.

19:11.918 --> 19:16.256
Judge Rebecca Wright,
I want you to have this.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.459
Thank you, sir,
very much.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.927
I know part of the reason
you gave me this is

19:20.960 --> 19:21.828
so I won't make fun of them
anymore,

19:21.861 --> 19:24.331
but I'm gonna continue
to make fun of them.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.433
Congratulations.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.934
Thank you, sir.
Feels good.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.569
- Okay, hey.
- Yes?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.238
Tedward and I have
a gift for you.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.071
- You do?
- Yeah, you ready?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.607
Sounds a little dirty
but, yeah, okay.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.508
- Where are you guys going?
- Cover your eyes.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.277
- Wait, where are we going?
- Come on.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.811
- Okay, right out here.
- Yeah.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
- Careful, take a step down.
- Okay.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.315
There you go, over here.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.583
- Don't peek.
- All right.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.584
Okay?

19:44.617 --> 19:45.585
What are you going
to do to me?

19:45.618 --> 19:48.921
Ready--one, two, three.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.924
No.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.294
How?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.795
[gasps]

19:55.828 --> 19:56.863
Am I dead?

19:56.896 --> 19:59.832
We saw the same van you saw,
and we chased it down

19:59.866 --> 20:01.568
because we are awesome.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.404
But turns out, the guy
who airbrushed yours made two.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.239
Yeah, one for himself
and one for his desert queen,

20:06.273 --> 20:08.941
who had a gambling problem.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.944
- I love you, Gary.
- I love you too.

20:11.978 --> 20:16.416
- [chuckles]
- Congratulations, Judge Wright.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.986
- Tedward, thank you.
- You're welcome, Judge.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.588
- Oh.
- I love you.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.890
Oh, Judy.
Oh.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.366
- [sighs]
- Here you go.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.302
[laughs]

20:36.603 --> 20:39.272

(Audra Mae
and the Almighty Sound)
* I'm bored of these pills

20:46.979 --> 20:49.582
Oh, okay.
Yes.

20:49.616 --> 20:53.386
* Across town
just to sit still *

20:53.420 --> 20:56.289
* I'm going my way

20:56.323 --> 20:58.458
* I'm gonna let loose

20:58.491 --> 21:00.560
* No, I don't care

21:00.593 --> 21:01.994
* Letting down my hair

21:02.028 --> 21:04.997
* Letting go of my balloon

21:05.031 --> 21:07.066
* Well, I'll follow this road

21:07.099 --> 21:09.436
All rise.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.839
The Honorable Rebecca Wright.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.475
Judge presiding.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.477
[clears throat]

21:17.510 --> 21:18.945
[sighs]

21:21.948 --> 21:22.949
Be seated.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.953
[crowd cheers]
