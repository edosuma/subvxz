WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.049
It's nice your dad's trusting usto handle shipment day alone.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.269
My dad's trying to finda new business venture,

00:08.312 --> 00:11.054
so gonna be moreresponsibility coming our way.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.099
A promotion,
a parking spot,

00:12.142 --> 00:14.101
control over
the bathroom code --

00:14.144 --> 00:15.450
69-69.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.234
Both: Yeahhh.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.107
Your uncle's birthday --June 9, 1969.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.414
Ooh, shipment day!

00:23.458 --> 00:25.721
What bounty has Lady Cattleman'sbeen blessed with?

00:27.288 --> 00:28.898
What are all these?
Walnuts?

00:28.941 --> 00:29.768
Brazil nuts?

00:29.812 --> 00:30.682
Deez nuts?

00:30.726 --> 00:31.988
Delivery man: They're chestnuts.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.730
And how would you know
what a chestnut looks like?

00:34.773 --> 00:37.254
Because I am one.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.435
Matthew Chestnut.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.442
Eddie, who the "H"
is this guy?

00:51.486 --> 00:53.749
He used to be Dad'sright-hand man until he bailed

00:53.792 --> 00:56.317
to go manage somerestaurant vendors at Dollywood.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.145
Dollywood?
There should be a Rebawood.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.973
Louis, I made a mistake
when I left.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.888
You're gol-dang rightyou did.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.238
I know how bad
it must've hurt.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.761
It hurt me, too.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.503
But I want to come back...
if you'll let me.

01:08.546 --> 01:12.115
Matthew,after that selfish, foul,

01:12.159 --> 01:14.465
disrespectful move
you pulled,

01:14.509 --> 01:17.033
there's no way I can even thinkof taking you back.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.218
...until we catch upover some cold ones, partner.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.786
Oh, man!

01:30.829 --> 01:32.004
Ah!

01:32.048 --> 01:33.354
Ah.Best shipment day ever!

01:33.397 --> 01:35.182
Oh, uh, speaking of,
I had to move

01:35.225 --> 01:36.183
some crates of onions
to the parking lot

01:36.226 --> 01:37.358
to do my clever nut bit.

01:37.401 --> 01:38.576
Oh. You heard
your new manager, boys.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.317
Go get those onions
outta the sun.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.494
Yeah. Wouldn't want them
to turn into sun-ions.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.148
Oh, God,it's good to have you back.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.149
Great to be back.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.151
Goodbye, promotion.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.545
"Dear diary,
today sucked again."

Please sit down.

02:14.264 --> 02:17.180
I would love to hear
about your problems.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.442
Wait.
What's happening?

02:18.486 --> 02:19.748
I'm LIEing.
Nice.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.011
Hey, everyone,
I have a funny mom.

02:22.054 --> 02:25.536
No. It's a technique from my
Teacher Administration book.

02:25.580 --> 02:29.323
Listen, Identify,
Encourage -- LIE.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.411
I'm not surehow any of that's gonna help

02:30.454 --> 02:31.542
with Chestnut coming back
to Cattleman's.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.327
Listening --
you have a problem.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.416
He's back one dayand already bossing us around.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.547
Identifying --
you're upset.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.549
And he's makingall these new rules,

02:38.593 --> 02:41.117
like "Delivery personnel cannoteat ketchup or mayo packets."

02:41.161 --> 02:44.033
How am I supposed to makeThousand Island in my mouth?

02:44.076 --> 02:45.426
Encouraging --

02:45.469 --> 02:48.080
Chestnut's not a problem.
Suck it up.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.562
Well, Chestnut's back,and it's awesome.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.913
I always liked his wife --
skinny, angry, thrifty.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.351
He divorced her.Of course he did.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.004
One woman's trash,another man's treasure.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.615
With him running the show,
I can finally focus

03:00.658 --> 03:02.356
on finding the next chapterof my life.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.358
Now, I know I've trieda lot of stuff,

03:04.401 --> 03:06.273
and this is going toseem silly,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.449
but I think I've foundmy next thing --

03:08.492 --> 03:09.450
gardening.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.147
Oh, I think
that's a great idea.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.366
Really?

03:12.409 --> 03:14.019
I thought you were going to say
"Oh, hell no,"

03:14.063 --> 03:16.370
or "A gardeneris a hobo wearing gloves,"

03:16.413 --> 03:18.285
or "Cucumbersattract pedophiles."

03:18.328 --> 03:20.461
I am fun, but no,
I'm actually glad

03:20.504 --> 03:22.376
you found something
to be passionate about,

03:22.419 --> 03:24.291
and I want to support you.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.162
Wait. Is this another oneof your schoolbook techniques?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.511
Are you LIEing again?
No.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.165
I just know
how much you've struggled

03:29.209 --> 03:30.949
to commit
to your next big thing.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.951
If you want to garden,
then garden.

03:32.995 --> 03:36.390
I 100% support whatever
you choose to do,

03:36.433 --> 03:39.306
as long as you 100%
support yourself.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.439
Wow. I really appreciateyou having my back on this.

03:42.483 --> 03:45.181
But if you're gonna do it,
do it the Louis way.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.313
I have a way?

03:46.356 --> 03:47.966
I didn't know I had a way.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.533
Well, you like
helping people.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.406
So instead of vegetables
in the backyard,

03:52.449 --> 03:54.277
maybe you start
a community garden.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.845
That's actually...
a great idea.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.629
One small request.

03:58.673 --> 03:59.717
No cucumbers?

03:59.761 --> 04:02.154
Pedophile candy.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.116
Can you believe
that women's pants

04:07.159 --> 04:08.378
don't havelength measurements?

04:08.422 --> 04:09.945
What are they,all the same height?

04:09.988 --> 04:10.946
Sexism!

04:10.989 --> 04:12.382
Uh-huh.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.776
And why are you readingthis book about V-word speeches?

04:14.819 --> 04:16.212
So I can identify
with women

04:16.256 --> 04:17.474
to be more believablein the school play

04:17.518 --> 04:18.562
as Lady Macbeth.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.303
You got a problem
with that, Mr. Man?

04:22.131 --> 04:23.959
Boys,
I'm glad you're home.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.875
I have a small babysitting favorto ask you.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.093
We'd love to watch
your girls,

04:28.137 --> 04:29.573
get all thatprecious baby time in

04:29.617 --> 04:30.879
before their breath turns.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.316
No, not them.
Marvin.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.928
Sure, but if you want us to takehim on walks, that's extra.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.583
I love him,
but now that he's retired,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.019
he is home all the time,

04:41.063 --> 04:42.543
and it can be
a little much.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.892
Well, I think it's great

04:43.935 --> 04:45.328
you're not conformingto the traditional maternal role

04:45.372 --> 04:46.677
that society thrustsupon women

04:46.721 --> 04:48.462
and are actively choosingto vacation

04:48.505 --> 04:49.593
from the domestic sphere.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.900
Uh, okay.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.163
W-- So, you'll watch him
for the day?

04:54.206 --> 04:56.252
He wants to take you out
for a ride on his new boat.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.949
A boat ride
with Uncle Marvin?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.124
Heck to the yes.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.388
I'm gonna slip-test
my new docksiders.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.478
Louis:
So, while we all laughed

05:04.521 --> 05:06.523
when rubber snakes came out
of the fire extinguisher,

05:06.567 --> 05:08.264
don't do it again.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.222
I know I'm scolding myself.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.789
Owning his own mistakes --
sign of a good leader.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.487
We're gonnahave to send a rescue team

05:13.530 --> 05:15.489
to get this guyoutta your dad's ass.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.577
Don't worry.
We got this.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.361
Hey, boss, quick pitch.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710
What about
a suggestion box?

05:19.754 --> 05:21.364
That way, employees can safely
share their ideas

05:21.408 --> 05:22.583
on how to run
the restaurant,

05:22.626 --> 05:24.498
like a bulletin board
for swapping shifts

05:24.541 --> 05:26.717
or take-home mints
at the host stand.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.502
Or well-defined
department boundaries,

05:28.545 --> 05:31.156
with particular focus
on newly rehired managers

05:31.200 --> 05:32.419
who may not realize
things have been working

05:32.462 --> 05:34.072
just fine for the past
year and a half!

05:34.116 --> 05:35.509
Reel it in, dude.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.598
Hmm. Suggestion box.
That's a good idea.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.251
You know,
back at D-wood,

05:39.295 --> 05:41.428
Dolly used to say she didn't
need a suggestion box

05:41.471 --> 05:42.994
'cause she walked around
with two big ones.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.476
Her left ear
and her right ear.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.390
Oh.
Ears.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.827
Yes, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

05:49.871 --> 05:50.959
Matty's right.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.439
We don't need
a suggestion box.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.440
Alright, team,
great meeting.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.529
If anything comes up,
take it to The Nut.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.835
I gotta get home and crank
on my garden.

05:57.879 --> 05:58.967
Whoa! Garden?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.664
Yeah. Gonna need
to hear all about that.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.275
I do have a great manure
mixture, if you need one.Hmm.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.973
Well, looks like we're stuck
with this doofus.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.105
He's gotthat divorced-man energy.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.803
We can't compete.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.067
Marvin: So,then the Italian says,

06:12.110 --> 06:13.460
"I didn't reportmy credit card stolen

06:13.503 --> 06:15.592
because the thief spends less
than my wife."

06:19.379 --> 06:21.381
You got your sea legsthere yet, Emery?

06:22.904 --> 06:24.471
It's not the boat.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.473
It's these jokes
that are promoting

06:26.516 --> 06:29.563
grotesque
and insensitive --

06:31.521 --> 06:33.349
I'm also a little seasick.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.132
What'd he say?

06:35.960 --> 06:38.789
I just want to catch
a big, tasty one,

06:38.833 --> 06:41.096
have Honey whip up
some fish tacos.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.445
I tell you,
that woman is a savant

06:42.489 --> 06:44.447
when it comes to
cabrilla and cabbage.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.059
My girlfriend, Sicily,microwaves a mean fish stick.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.104
They should meet.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.888
Wait a minute.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.150
Are you both implying

06:52.194 --> 06:55.110
it's the man's job
to bring home the bacon

06:55.153 --> 06:57.068
and the woman's role to cook it?

06:57.112 --> 06:58.330
Huh? Bacon?

06:58.374 --> 07:00.115
What?

07:00.158 --> 07:03.510
No. Honey handles allthe groceries in our household.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.294
I just want to catch
a fish big enough

07:05.337 --> 07:06.469
that can eat
a license plate.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.166
Mm.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.648
Oh, come on, Emery.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.910
You gotta man up.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.260
Yeah, Emery,
grow a pair!

07:19.221 --> 07:21.745
Honey wrote
a biography?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.704
What could be in there?
She does nothing.

07:23.747 --> 07:24.966
No.
It's Dolly Parton.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.534
I've accepted the factthat Chestnut's here to stay,

07:27.577 --> 07:28.709
so I'm getting aheadof all the sweet sayings

07:28.752 --> 07:30.188
I'll be hearing
from now on.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.625
Yee-haw.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.322
There was a stretch of time
where I was saying

07:33.365 --> 07:34.715
"rootin' tootin'"
a lot.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.326
But I wasn't using it
the right way.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.936
Morning.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.636
Oh. Gardening in a suit,
like a rich man.

07:42.679 --> 07:43.767
I like it.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.552
No.
I'm off the garden.What?

07:45.595 --> 07:47.336
After all that searching,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.599
I thought you finally found
what you wanted to do.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.732
Yeah, and I appreciate
you supporting me,

07:51.775 --> 07:54.299
but I talked to Chestnut,
and he made me realize

07:54.343 --> 07:56.127
I should just concentrate
on the restaurant.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.781
But I thought
you were excited

07:57.825 --> 07:59.783
by the idea
of the community garden.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.350
Oh, I was,
but then Chestnut convinced me

08:01.393 --> 08:02.569
I'm better off
at Cattleman's.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.658
He left to chase his
next big thing at Dollywood,

08:04.701 --> 08:07.443
only to learn that the grass
wasn't greener.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.575
It was blue.

08:08.618 --> 08:09.576
Bluegrass.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.186
Music.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.666
Well, you know
where the grass is greener?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.581
A well-tended garden.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.758
Anyway, he's back to supporting
me 100%, just like you.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.281
I rootin' tootin' do.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.197
Looks like Chestnut'san el problemo.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.894
What do you know?

08:23.938 --> 08:24.982
Spanish I is taking.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.993
We all have a common goal,
so I suggest we join forces.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.432
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.999
Wait.
I'm your enemy?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.044
My new friend.

08:44.088 --> 08:44.828
What is this room?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.264
It used to be Grandma's room,

08:46.308 --> 08:48.266
but now it's our War Room,

08:48.310 --> 08:52.706
where we'll strategize
on how to get rid of Chestnut.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.620
Mom hates Chestnut

08:53.663 --> 08:55.752
because Dad didn't listen to herabout gardening.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.188
It's bigger than that.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.626
It took him so long
to find his new path.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.714
I don't want him to give up

09:00.757 --> 09:03.281
on something
he was so excited about.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.848
Can't you just tell himChestnut's dumb?

09:04.892 --> 09:05.849
That's something
you'd say.

09:05.893 --> 09:06.850
No.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.505
I said I would
support him 100%.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.725
But he'll never refocus
with that idiot in his ear.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.640
Good luck,
because Dad and Chestnut

09:13.683 --> 09:16.077
are like a couple
of cottontails
drunk on sweet tea.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.297
Dern it, why's everything
Dolly says so cute?

09:19.341 --> 09:21.386
That's it.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.607
Chestnut once left Cattleman's
for Dollywood.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.478
Maybe he'll leave again

09:26.522 --> 09:29.046
if the right offer
comes his way.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.703
Who is this old couplesleeping?

09:33.747 --> 09:34.835
His parents.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.488
If things get hairy,
he needs to know

09:36.532 --> 09:39.535
the elder Nuts
are within our reach.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.409
Jane Austensure can spin a yarn.Emery: Right?

09:44.453 --> 09:45.715
And as a female author,

09:45.759 --> 09:47.064
she had to fight
the double standard.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.631
And look at thosebeautiful blue peepers.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.763
What a dish.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.547
Rowr.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.288
What's gotten into you?

09:53.331 --> 09:56.334
You've been speaking likea 1945 radio show all afternoon.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.901
What are you talking about,
baby doll?

09:57.945 --> 09:59.555
"Baby doll"?
"Man up"?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.123
Earlier today, you commented on
the weather lady's "gams."

10:02.166 --> 10:03.690
Oh, please.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.692
You read one bookwith the V-word in the title,

10:05.735 --> 10:07.911
and you're gonna lecture me
on feminism?

10:07.955 --> 10:09.086
I support women.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.698
I literally decorated my roomwith one --

10:11.741 --> 10:13.830
Brandi Chastain.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.876
You only have that
because you got the tingles

10:15.919 --> 10:17.138
when she ripped
her shirt off.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.356
Objectifier!

10:18.400 --> 10:20.837
Everything'sa daytime drama with you.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.317
Oh, yeah?

10:22.360 --> 10:23.797
If you really don't think
it's a problem,

10:23.840 --> 10:25.886
why don't we call Sicily,
comment on her "gams"?

10:25.929 --> 10:28.062
No, no, no, no, no, no!God, no!

10:28.105 --> 10:29.846
Maybe you're right.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.021
I guess when
I'm around Marvin,

10:31.065 --> 10:32.849
all that stuffjust comes out of me.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.373
But I don't wanna stophanging out with him.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.028
Then we just
have to change him.Tall order.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.074
We're talking about a guy whostill calls Germany "Prussia."

10:40.117 --> 10:41.641
Hmm.

10:44.861 --> 10:48.473
Hey, Lou, where do you think
this little guy's paddling to?

10:48.517 --> 10:50.954
I like to thinkhe's headed upriver to Canada

10:50.998 --> 10:51.912
to avoid the war.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.740
Ah, the Great Squirrel War.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.263
I love
the way you think.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.265
Louis.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.266
Nut Man.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.354
M'Cattlelady.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.835
Uh, no. Okay.

11:01.878 --> 11:02.749
Jessica, what are you
doing here?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.489
I'm here to support you

11:04.533 --> 11:05.708
since you're fully committed

11:05.752 --> 11:07.492
to staying
exactly where you are.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.493
That's so sweet.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.756
If Matthew doesn't mind,

11:09.799 --> 11:10.931
I would love to see
this new griddle

11:10.974 --> 11:12.193
you've been talking about.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.542
Oh, yeah,
I could show you --

11:13.585 --> 11:15.283
No.
You stay here.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.806
If you're looking
for something to do,

11:16.850 --> 11:17.720
you should keep an eye

11:17.764 --> 11:19.896
on those suspicious-looking boysin the corner.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.942
Curtains up. We're on.

11:25.902 --> 11:29.210
Oh, no. He's coming.
Hide the papers.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.298
What do you got there, boys?

11:30.341 --> 11:31.995
God, you're so good.You got us.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.215
If we tell you, you promiseto keep it a secret?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.869
I am a chestnut

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
that doesn't crack.

11:37.609 --> 11:38.915
It's an application
for a manager position

11:38.959 --> 11:40.351
at a new Tony Roma's.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.788
We want to apply,

11:41.831 --> 11:44.138
but we're not sure if weshould leave Cattleman's.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.444
It's located
at Seaside and 4th.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.230
That is aquarium-adjacent.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.014
Lotta happy,
hungry families.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.234
Twice the pay, too.
Full dental.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.931
Certainly interesting.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.368
Um, who is
the regional manager?

11:57.412 --> 12:00.154
Uh...Donny Worthington.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.025
Big believer
in upward mobility.

12:02.069 --> 12:02.896
Great golfer.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.811
They arefranchising quickly.

12:04.854 --> 12:08.336
Fun suspenders, great ribs --St. Louis
andMemphis style.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.990
It's an ambitious menu.

12:10.033 --> 12:10.904
Uh, Donny Worthington,you say?

12:11.948 --> 12:12.819
Thank you, boys.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
He totally bought it.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.779
Tell me everything,

12:16.823 --> 12:19.173
because I was so in character,
I remember nothing.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.044
You were
playing yourself.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.785
I thought
I was playing you.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
I appreciate your concern,

12:27.834 --> 12:30.445
but I treat galswith class and respect.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.794
I'm just froma different generation.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.057
That's all.
We know you are.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.624
We just want to make sure
you don't offend anybody.

12:35.667 --> 12:39.584
Hey, guys, I was an outdoorboot model for five years,

12:39.628 --> 12:42.370
so I think I've earned the rightto say "Grow some balls"

12:42.413 --> 12:43.240
if I want.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.720
Balls!

12:46.113 --> 12:47.723
Bikini?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.682
Training her early to be focusedon having a hot summer bod?

12:50.726 --> 12:53.947
Wow, a real digital clock
for the stove.
Mnh.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.601
Someone won't be burning the
roast when husband comes home.

12:56.645 --> 12:57.646
Dirty dog.

12:57.689 --> 12:58.821
You guys are right.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.475
I have to learn
some of this new stuff

13:00.518 --> 13:02.477
so I can be
a more sensitive father.

13:03.913 --> 13:04.827
Teach me.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.657
A father and son
are in a car accident

13:08.700 --> 13:09.963
and are sent to
separate hospitals.
Mm.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.878
When the boy is taken in
for operation,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.401
the doctor says...

13:13.444 --> 13:15.055
"I can't operatebecause he's my son."

13:15.098 --> 13:15.882
How's that possible?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.276
It's the boy's mother.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.451
The doctor's a woman.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.540
But then who's the nurse?

13:24.281 --> 13:27.110
What's an appropriate comment
for the man to make?

13:27.154 --> 13:30.853
Trick question.
He shouldn't say anything.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.550
And he should keep his eyes
above the deck guns.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.291
-Come on, man.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.429
Oh.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.909
Oh, thank you.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.302
Uh, I know.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.696
Give me a construction hat
and teach me to whistle.

13:47.739 --> 13:48.915
I failed.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.004
No. Open the door
for any woman you want,

13:51.047 --> 13:52.962
as long as you don't treat her
like she's helpless.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.138
The fact that you're thinkingabout this is a win.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.010
Hey, back to
that doctor joke --

13:57.053 --> 14:00.143
are you sure it's not
two gay dads?

14:03.494 --> 14:06.019
I'd like to raise
a glass of powdered lemonade

14:06.062 --> 14:08.238
to new friends and bonds
that can never be broken.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.326
That's enough.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.111
Chestnut was droolingover that fake job.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.895
I bet he's telling Dadhe's quitting right now.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.289
Then Louis will see him
as the opportunistic weed

14:15.332 --> 14:17.117
in his garden of dreams.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.075
Whoa.
Next time, you're toasting.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.600
Louis: I had an
interesting conversation

14:22.644 --> 14:23.819
with Chestnut today.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.255
Just when you think
you can trust people...

14:25.299 --> 14:26.691
Oh, don't be upset.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.519
How could you knowhe'd abandon you again?

14:28.563 --> 14:31.174
He didn't do
anything wrong.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.610
The boys tried to trick him
into quitting.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.178
A new steakhouse?

14:35.222 --> 14:36.179
Managed by...

14:36.223 --> 14:38.181
Donny Worthington?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.358
I'm sorry, Ma.
I panicked.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.577
I almost said
"Dolly Parton"

14:42.620 --> 14:44.013
because that's the bookI'm reading.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.972
In rehearsals, you never askedfor a manager's name.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.625
Wait.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.062
You're involved
in this?

14:49.105 --> 14:50.324
I should've known
once you showed up

14:50.367 --> 14:52.065
suddenly interested
in Cattleman's.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.937
Hey, don't confuse yourmild frustration with the boys

14:54.981 --> 14:57.635
with my enthusiasmover your new griddle.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.812
All those knobs --
very cool.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.032
Oh, thanks. Your support
is greatly appreciated.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.425
That's how ILIE.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.949
Hey, Trent,
you wanna go play in my room?

15:06.993 --> 15:07.950
Go with it. I'm you.

15:07.994 --> 15:08.951
Let's get out of here.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.735
Go.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.829
Well, I know you havea lot going on,

15:17.873 --> 15:20.006
so I'll go punish the boys.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.008
You said
you'd support me 100%,

15:22.051 --> 15:23.444
and now you're going
behind my back?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.620
Well, I thought
with Chestnut gone,

15:25.663 --> 15:27.187
you would focuson your passion again.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.972
You were so upsetwhen you didn't have one.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.235
I didn't want you
to go back to that.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.368
And you thought giving him a
fake application to Tony Roma's

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
would solve that?He bailed on you once.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.762
I thought he would
do it again.

15:37.806 --> 15:38.981
He's a name chaser,
Louis --

15:39.025 --> 15:42.332
Kenny Rogers,
Dolly Parton...

15:42.376 --> 15:44.421
Donny Worthington.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.684
The only name Chestnut
cares about is Louis Huang.

15:46.728 --> 15:47.816
He didn't come to me
to quit.

15:47.859 --> 15:48.991
He came
with a bunch of ideas

15:49.035 --> 15:51.254
to respond
to the new competition.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.603
So those arereal glasses.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.127
They're not "dumb personplaying smart person" glasses.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.389
Yeah.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.478
He even took my garden idea
and improved it --

15:57.521 --> 15:58.696
a beer garden.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.437
Now we're gonna spend
every waking minute

16:00.481 --> 16:02.004
making it
the best Asian-owned

16:02.048 --> 16:04.093
Western steakhouse
German beer hall

16:04.137 --> 16:07.140
run by an Irishman
in Orlando.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.838
You know, it's nice
having a partner

16:09.881 --> 16:12.928
who actually
supports you 100%.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.024
Hey, boys.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.244
Thanks for returning
my jar opener in one piece.

16:27.899 --> 16:31.686
Honey, you are a strong,independent woman,

16:31.729 --> 16:34.906
and you don't need meto help you open up that jar.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.604
Aww, sweet pea.
I'm glad you feel that way.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.474
Yes!

16:38.519 --> 16:39.824
But the jar is stuck,

16:39.868 --> 16:42.218
so I'm gonna need you
to reach into your purse,

16:42.262 --> 16:43.959
find your testicles,
and open it.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.265
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.832
All this sexist languagedidn't come from Marvin.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.530
It was coming
from Honey all along?

16:49.573 --> 16:50.748
Come on!

16:50.792 --> 16:52.315
Hike up your prom dress!

16:53.099 --> 16:54.187
What, are you
on your period?!

16:54.230 --> 16:55.840
Come on!

17:01.368 --> 17:03.283
This beer garden's
a nightmare.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.501
Chestnut made us
bring steins home

17:04.545 --> 17:05.546
to get used to
the weight.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.983
This thing
is bottomless.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.333
Like Porky Pig.All he wears is a blazer.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.639
Did Donny
put anything in there

17:11.682 --> 17:13.206
about when the teacher
makes a mistake?

17:13.249 --> 17:14.990
No.That would've been helpful.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.949
Instead, the wimp diedbefore he got to that chapter.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.560
If it helps,
I'm blaming Trent.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.301
It does help.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.567
Mmm.

17:26.610 --> 17:30.136
They taste better
when you grow them yourself.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.529
Whoa, Grandma.
Those still have stems.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.575
You're growing vegetables now,Jenny? Where?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.881
In Louis' garden.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.796
Louis gave up his garden,
thanks to Chestnut.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.971
He left me in charge.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.799
I am a boss now.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.367
So he didn'tgive up
his garden.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.109
Mmm!

17:47.153 --> 17:49.155
I know nothing
about women.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.550
Don't beat
yourself up.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.335
A lot of great men
never understood women --

17:55.378 --> 17:58.990
Harvey Milk, Elton John,
Freddie Mercury.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.688
Turns out I'mthe one
who's biased.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.733
I need to take a long lookin the mirror.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.126
That's what
you always do --

18:04.170 --> 18:06.259
20 minutes fixing your hair,
one air kiss,

18:06.302 --> 18:07.912
and two finger guns.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.000
I made an assumption

18:09.044 --> 18:11.002
that all that sexist stuffcame from Marvin

18:11.046 --> 18:12.830
just because
he's an older guy.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.789
Oppressor.
And a narcissist.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.357
What if I can't
turn this off?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.401
What if I'm just someone

18:18.445 --> 18:20.011
that always judges a bookby its cover?

18:20.055 --> 18:22.144
Sometimes you gotta judge
a book by its cover.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.581
Or else you never would've
bought "The Vagina Monologues"

18:24.625 --> 18:26.279
in the first place.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.541
You're right.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.021
And I never would have learnedsuch valuable lessons.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.546
As long as you're thinking
about it, it's a win.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.287
Sound familiar?

18:34.330 --> 18:35.375
Wow.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.420
All this time we thoughtwe were babysitting Marvin,

18:37.464 --> 18:38.987
he was babysitting us.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.163
And your feminism's
spreading through the house.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.992
I saw a V-word book
in Eddie's room, too.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.995
But it was a magazine
and sealed in plastic.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.257
Hmm.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.222
Oh, hey, Jessica.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.354
Knife to stab you back,

18:58.398 --> 19:00.356
as in my back...

19:00.400 --> 19:02.445
here at the restaurant,
with a knife.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.230
Are you here to stab me
in the back again?

19:04.273 --> 19:06.449
No. There's somethingI have to say to you,

19:06.493 --> 19:08.016
and it's not
going to be easy.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.583
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you --

19:09.626 --> 19:11.193
Chestnut wasn't the problem.It was you.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.760
That just turned
so fast.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.370
Chestnut didn't make you quityour garden.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.198
You did that on your own,

19:16.242 --> 19:19.201
just like you abandoned beinga barber and a tour guide

19:19.245 --> 19:20.420
and a horse photographer.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.291
Well, the last one
was an allergy thing,

19:22.335 --> 19:23.988
but thanks for bringing up
all my failures.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.120
You're welcome.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.339
Failures are what
you're good at.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.470
Oh, I love you, too.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.777
And Cattleman's
is not a failure.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.387
I wasn't talking
about Cattleman's.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.084
Cattleman's is great.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.695
Louis, think about it.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.087
You come upwith something great,

19:36.131 --> 19:37.611
and then,
when you get bored,

19:37.654 --> 19:38.829
you hand it off

19:38.873 --> 19:40.788
and then you come upwith your next new thing,

19:40.831 --> 19:43.269
like when you gave the gardento Grandma.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.663
Well, her wheelchair is perfect
for aerating the soil.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.057
Mm-hmm.I was right to support you.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.493
You are a gardener.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.582
You like to plant seeds --

19:52.626 --> 19:55.063
idea seeds,
business seeds.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.327
So I'm a business farmer.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.894
A business consultant.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.461
You get new ideas
off the ground,

20:01.504 --> 20:03.941
and then you move on tothe next thing that excites you.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.465
It's perfect for you.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.031
Well,
if I'm going for it,

20:07.075 --> 20:08.250
this is the kind of support
I'll need.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.295
Well, then that's
what you'll get.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.166
And I promise

20:11.210 --> 20:14.256
that Trent will nevergo behind your back again.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.953
Uh, apology accepted.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.955
Maybe you're right.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.740
If I can turn
a condemned strip club

20:19.783 --> 20:22.264
into a salmonella-free
family restaurant,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.613
then maybe I canconsult.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.876
You already did it
once this week.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.487
I sure did.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.270
What was it?

20:28.314 --> 20:30.490
With your mom.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.361
I thought it was smartto put her in the garden,

20:32.405 --> 20:35.364
start her getting usedto all that dirt.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.725
You know,
I hate to admit it.

20:48.769 --> 20:49.944
Chestnut's
kinda growing on me.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.163
Eddie: Besides
a couple of blips,

20:52.207 --> 20:53.861
Germany hada pretty fun culture.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.428
Guten Tag, mein fraus.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.518
Whoa. How are you carrying
that many?

20:58.561 --> 20:59.780
Oh, I built up my hand strength

20:59.823 --> 21:02.217
crawling out
of your father's ass.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.741
You're on, boys.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.397
Well, we did wantmore responsibility.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.717
I hate this.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.588
I've never felt prettier.
