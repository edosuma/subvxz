00:08.270 --> 00:10.100
My name  is Melinda Gordon

00:12.340 --> 00:17.000
I just got married,just move to a small town,just open *** shoop

00:17.200 --> 00:20.030
And might be just like you

00:20.050 --> 00:24.460
Except from the time that I was a little girl,I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.170
It's all right,honey.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.590
"Earthbound spirits" my grandmother call them.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.540
They stay here because they have unfinished business with the living,and they come to me for help.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.940
To tell you my story,I have to tell you theirs.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.680
Tomorrow? I thought your mom was coming friday.

00:49.790 --> 00:55.550
Yeah. I just got off the phone with her. She's all excited 'cause she gets to come a day earlier.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.390
First parental visit. Wow. I'm so excited.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.680
Yeah. I just wish we were farther along on the house.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.099
Hey. Sometimes it's fun to see a work in progress.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.660
See it? Yeah. Live it...no.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.480
You got the sawdust out of the living room. At least that's something.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.260
We should take before and after shots so--

01:19.080 --> 01:20.300
--whoa! 
--What?

01:20.480 --> 01:23.240
Uh,a little situation here on the railroad tracks. I'll call you later.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.220
Honey?

01:26.040 --> 01:31.280
All right,you two! Off the tracks! Now! Move it!

01:32.270 --> 01:36.390
Dylan,what's the matter with you? Do you know what your mother would do if she saw you on these tracks?

01:36.650 --> 01:38.100
Kenny said it was safe.

01:38.130 --> 01:42.640
And if kenny said it was safe to jump in front of a moving truck,would you do that,too?

01:43.080 --> 01:44.800
How did you get all the way out here?

01:45.190 --> 01:46.930
We walked.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.930
--Kenny! 
--No!

01:50.510 --> 01:56.110
Kenny! Kenny!

02:02.230 --> 02:05.670
Whoa! How'd you do that?!

02:05.760 --> 02:09.479
That was not funny. Dylan,go get in the car,and I'll take you back to your mom.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.860
--But the coins.
--Go.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.460
What are you doing here,kenny?

02:16.840 --> 02:18.900
Waitin' for my mommy.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.540
She said when I get lost,I should stay where I am and she'll find me.

02:35.940 --> 02:39.640
ok,kenny. Let's get you figured out.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.700
Ok.

03:27.230 --> 03:28.500
Dylan,where've you been?

03:28.700 --> 03:30.040
I found him down by the tracks.

03:30.170 --> 03:34.440
By the tracks? Dylan,I've told you not to leave the square.

03:34.660 --> 03:36.020
Kenny told me to come with him.

03:36.130 --> 03:41.170
--For the last time,there's no kenny. 
--Yes,there is! She talked to him,too!

03:41.380 --> 03:45.610
--Don't you talk back to me. 
--Tell her,melinda. She never believes me.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.160
Sure. We all had a nice conversation.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.650
Why would you encourage him?

03:50.010 --> 03:53.100
You think it's healthy for a boy his age to have a make-believe friend?

03:53.260 --> 03:58.000
Why not? Besides,I think I read somewhere that michael jordan has one.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.560
Come on,dylan.

04:03.050 --> 04:04.880
And you're welcome.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.710
I knew it. Listen to this. It's an article from last october.

04:13.790 --> 04:18.279
"Tragedy struck saturday when a freight train "collided with an S.U.V. At the grandview rail crossing.

04:18.579 --> 04:24.110
"Candace dale and her 10-month-old daughter narrowly escaped,but her 6-year-old son kenny perished in the accident."

04:24.170 --> 04:25.850
That's the kid I met yesterday.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.450
So sad. Why is he still here?

04:28.560 --> 04:32.990
He's waiting for his mother to come and find him.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.380
--Can you help him? 
--He disappeared on me.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.690
Wait. Didn't you say that kid dylan was playing with him?

04:39.420 --> 04:40.300
Well,how could he see him?

04:40.340 --> 04:42.160
Kids can almost always see spirits.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.930
Where do you think imaginary friends come from?

04:45.590 --> 04:48.550
Well... that could explain a lot about my childhood.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.730
It says here that his mother works at a bookstore in brookside. That's not too far.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.510
I should go talk to her.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.960
Wait. With kenny?

04:57.530 --> 05:00.360
Well,I'll have him close by,but I should get her alone first. Don't you think?

05:00.700 --> 05:04.130
Explain to her? I mean,this kid could wait for all eternity if I don't help.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.940
Eternity's a long time. I'm just askin' for an extra couple days till my mom leaves.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.700
This is gonna be an easy one.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.840
I know where the child is. I know where the mother is. In and out. Nobody gets hurt.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.110
Famous last words. Look. Please. While my mom's here...

05:16.340 --> 05:19.110
I know. I know. You don't want her to think I'm weird.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.780
No,mel,I never said that.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.800
I just want her to know you as you first.

05:24.170 --> 05:31.720
I want her to see what I see-- you know,the adorable,wonderful girl with a big heart. And a great sense of humor.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.690
Then she can find out you're weird.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.450
Do you remember me?

06:05.070 --> 06:06.650
I want my mommy.

06:06.810 --> 06:10.470
I think I know where your mommy is. Want me to take you to her?

06:10.650 --> 06:14.190
She told me to wait if I ever got lost.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.370
But maybe she doesn't know where to look.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.410
Maybe it's time to find her.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.190
Ok.

06:31.810 --> 06:34.440
--We have a spider like that. 
--Really?

06:34.780 --> 06:36.050
I got it at the fair.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.370
Cool. So did I.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.460
Mommy was mad at me when I wanted it.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.780
Why was she mad at you?

06:42.950 --> 06:45.900
Because I didn't do what she wanted.

06:52.850 --> 06:54.250
Hi,andrea.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.090
Hey,dylan. Does your mom know you're here?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.590
Yeah. I got something for you.

07:02.290 --> 07:03.620
You shouldn't have.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.890
It's igneous. If you get it wet,it looks really cool.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.310
--Want to get it wet now? 
--Nope.

07:10.040 --> 07:16.250
Ok. Do you know there are 3 different types of rocks? Igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.440
Some people think minerals are rocks,but they're not.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.060
--Minerals...  
--dylan.

07:21.350 --> 07:23.070
Uh,don't you think your mom's probably wondering where you are?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.040
Maybe you should... go back to the salon.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.500
I hate it there. It smells weird.

07:27.630 --> 07:30.740
Well,um,why don't you,like,run over to the park or somethin'?

07:30.980 --> 07:32.020
She won't let me.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.350
Don't you have,like,a friend or someone you could play with?

07:34.750 --> 07:37.270
Yeah,I did.He went away.

07:38.740 --> 07:42.880
Oh. Look. I'm sorry,honey. I'm just,um... really busy right now. Ok?

07:43.130 --> 07:46.320
I'll tell you what. On my lunch break,I'll check out the rock. Ok.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.240
Ok. Thank you.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.980
Kenny,you stay in the car for a few minutes. Ok?

07:59.060 --> 08:03.040
I'm gonna go talk to your mom and make sure she's not mad anymore. Then you can come in.

08:06.140 --> 08:09.550
I know this place! Mommy works here!

08:15.010 --> 08:16.670
Kenny,I told you to stay.

08:16.770 --> 08:21.260
I like the bookstore. Mommy said that next year I could read chapter books.

08:21.820 --> 08:24.970
Do you know what happened when you and your mommy were separated?

08:25.320 --> 08:28.710
Do you remember that night? Do you... remember the train?

08:29.130 --> 08:32.350
Kind of yes. Kind of no.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.760
You don't really understand,do you?

08:34.960 --> 08:36.400
Understand what?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.980
Hi. I'm looking for candace dale.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.030
Sorry. Candace isn't here today.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.570
Oh,but it's really important that I speak to her. Do you know if she's home,or--

09:01.590 --> 09:03.260
are you a friend of hers?

09:03.730 --> 09:07.050
More like a friend of her son...kenny.

09:07.230 --> 09:11.370
I'm sorry. Um,she's at the courthouse. Today's the day.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.210
Yes. Right. Thanks.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.450
Hey,mom.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.880
Let's have a look.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.100
Oh,marriage seems to agree with you fairly well.

09:44.460 --> 09:48.400
Although I thought new husbands are supposed to put on a few pounds eating their wives' wonderful food.

09:48.560 --> 09:54.200
Uh,melinda doesn't cook that much. Which is fine with me. You know that always was my,uh,skill.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.500
--Let me get this.
--No,no,no.

09:55.640 --> 10:00.000
 I'm still young enough to carry my own bags,thank god. Let's go.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.750
A lovely little place.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.330
If I'd had a little notice,we could've really put together a showcase wedding here.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.620
You know,mom,we're not really into the showcase thing.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.050
Well,it was a beautiful wedding.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.740
It's just that with your brother gone,yours was the only wedding I had to look forward to.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.720
And I get a chance to really get to know my daughter-in-law.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.350
Well,you know,melinda's got this antique store--

10:19.580 --> 10:22.220
oh,I don't understand. Why is she still melinda gordon?

10:22.430 --> 10:24.390
Why won't she take clancy?

10:24.620 --> 10:25.840
Has she got something against the irish?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.950
No. I'm sure she loves the irish. It's just that--

10:28.300 --> 10:30.350
you know. She wanted to keep her own identity,and...

10:30.550 --> 10:33.440
oh,what's a simple name? It's the thing that defines her.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.560
Well,as I was saying,melinda has this antique store--

10:35.650 --> 10:37.010
I know. It sounds so cute.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.990
Yeah. It--it's cute.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.970
But it's a new business,and she spends a lot of time there,and--

10:41.990 --> 10:46.700
relax,jim. I'm not gonna haunt the girl. Just want to get to know her.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.780
Kenny.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.680
There's mommy and daddy!

11:13.720 --> 11:17.390
What's the matter? Is she mad at me?

11:17.700 --> 11:21.890
No,I don't think so,honey. I really don't.

11:30.310 --> 11:34.740
I'll go talk to your mommy a little bit later... find out why she's sad. Ok?

11:35.290 --> 11:37.990
Then maybe we can both talk to her.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.610
Hey. We are knee-deep in hatpins. Did you know we had 189?

11:47.830 --> 11:49.030
I need to talk to you in private.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.530
In private? We're the only people in the store.

11:50.590 --> 11:51.370
No. We're not.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.780
Damn. That always gives me goose bumps.

11:54.110 --> 11:56.010
Ok. Uh... who--who's here?

11:56.320 --> 11:59.320
A 6-year-old boy. He was in a train crash last october.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.040
Oh,poor baby.

12:01.190 --> 12:03.350
And the thing is,he doesn't know he's dead.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.410
Ok. 5 minutes ago,my day was all about hatpins.

12:06.470 --> 12:07.710
I have to go see his mother.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.820
I need her to tell him,make him realize what happened. Then maybe he'll cross over.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.820
So you need me to mind the store.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.220
I need you to mind the kid.

12:13.290 --> 12:14.580
How do you mind a ghost?

12:14.760 --> 12:20.640
Well...just... pretend like you can see him. He's right there next to the table.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.770
--Am I freaking you out? 
--Yeah!

12:31.830 --> 12:35.940
Um...hey there,little guy.

12:36.610 --> 12:39.950
Uh,I'm andrea,and welcome to our store.

12:40.220 --> 12:45.510
Um...we got some really cool antique toys in the back of the store. You want to go see 'em?

12:46.060 --> 12:48.950
Uh,take a look,but don't touch.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.530
Is somethin' wrong with her?

12:51.950 --> 12:55.490
Uh,she'S...blind.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.970
Um...can I go look at those toys?

12:58.310 --> 12:58.630
Sure.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.570
...Also,um,look at some books.

13:00.700 --> 13:05.340
And...oh! We got some really awesome stereopticon slides you can look at later.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.520
Andrea. Time out.

13:08.050 --> 13:08.780
He's over it.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.130
How'd I do?

13:10.160 --> 13:11.440
Great.

13:12.630 --> 13:13.130
After you.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.910
Oh,my goodness!

13:17.100 --> 13:19.060
Mrs. Clancy. I'm so glad that you're here.

13:19.180 --> 13:24.190
Melinda. Oh,you look wonderful. You're absolutely glowing.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.000
Thanks. Well...yeah. You can...

13:26.930 --> 13:30.420
you can work up quite a glow when you're hauling boxes up from the basement.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.990
Uh,andrea,this is jim's mom-- mrs. Clancy.

13:33.260 --> 13:37.600
--Hi. 
--Hi. Now,we have to find a better name for me than that.

13:37.760 --> 13:45.340
Faith. Mother. Mother faith. Maybe...nana? What do you think?

13:45.340 --> 13:47.650
Do you have any creepy freaks?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.310
--No. 
--No? No to which one?

13:50.310 --> 13:54.220
You should get some. They're never gonna sell this old stuff.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.920
Uh,I'll have to think about that.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.970
O...K. Um,take your time.

13:59.260 --> 14:05.460
Will you excuse me... for a minute? I need to go... get a box and... you know,count stuff.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.970
--Kenny...You can't do that.
--Do what?

14:20.210 --> 14:22.870
Well... interrupt grownups while they're talking.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.290
My mommy says that,too.

14:24.370 --> 14:27.290
Your mommy is right,and I'm betting your mom is home now,so

14:27.550 --> 14:30.320
I'm gonna go talk to her,and I want you to stay here with andrea till I get back. Ok?

14:30.550 --> 14:33.090
The blind lady? She's weird.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.520
Just promise me. Ok?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.970
Ok...I guess.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.430
Oh. So,where are you taking me to lunch?

14:42.750 --> 14:45.120
Lunch. Right!

14:45.550 --> 14:49.750
The thing is,um,I have to run off and do an errand. But the two of you just go ahead without me.

14:49.900 --> 14:50.730
Well,what do you have to do?

14:50.820 --> 14:52.640
--It's hard to explain.
--Oh,no.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.090
I'm so sorry.

14:54.140 --> 15:00.420
The thing is,I really...really want to spend time with you,mrs.,Uh... faith...mother faith.

15:00.570 --> 15:06.010
It's just,uh... I have to go. Bye.

15:07.280 --> 15:12.080
Well,you know,she's,um... she'S...on the go.

15:18.770 --> 15:21.360
--Yes? 
--Hi. Mrs. Dale,I'm sorry to bother you.

15:22.500 --> 15:26.650
Um,my name is melinda gordon. I was a friend of kenny'S.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.620
So I guess you heard about the verdict.

15:28.990 --> 15:32.890
--Who is it? 
--This...woman says she knew kenny.

15:33.110 --> 15:34.010
Are you from school?

15:34.370 --> 15:37.610
No. No,I work in town. I have a store.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.880
Anyway...uh,the--the reason I'm here...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.900
could I come in for a minute?

15:43.190 --> 15:44.630
What's on your mind?

15:45.410 --> 15:49.600
Well,I know that this is gonna sound...strange,but I have...

15:50.070 --> 15:59.320
I--I can... I'm asking you to consider the possibility that when people die... they don't always leave.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.580
Well,we-- we can't see them,but their spirits--

16:02.670 --> 16:04.550
what the hell kind of garbage is this? Who are you?

16:04.550 --> 16:07.820
Hank,please. What are you trying to say?

16:08.090 --> 16:11.140
I'm not listenin' to this crap,and neither should you.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.230
I'm sorry about hank.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.400
It's been A... tough day.

16:30.780 --> 16:31.710
Tough year.

16:32.310 --> 16:35.590
It's like I've...just been marking time.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.970
I love my daughter. I...I love hank.

16:39.800 --> 16:46.130
But... when I look ahead,I just see all these years without kenny.

16:47.620 --> 16:51.600
For the first time in my life,I hate being young.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.960
Candace,I saw kenny.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.290
What do you mean?

16:57.890 --> 17:01.560
Sometimes... when a person dies,their spirit's left behind.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.720
They have... things to finish,messages to get across,or they don't know that they've died.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.869
They don't know how to take the next step.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.460
I've spoken to kenny.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.700
And he doesn't understand what's happened to him,and...

17:14.970 --> 17:16.660
he's waiting for you to find him.

17:17.099 --> 17:20.540
You want me to believe you saw my son?

17:20.690 --> 17:22.690
I know how hard this is.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.480
I do. Kenny said that you told him to wait...

17:26.520 --> 17:30.390
wherever he was if--if he got lost and--and you would... come to him.

17:30.660 --> 17:31.810
Oh,my god.

17:31.850 --> 17:36.690
He was also... a-attracted to this little spider ornament that I have on my rearview mirror.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.230
He said that you got him the same thing at the fair.

17:39.310 --> 17:40.540
Kenny. My boy.

17:41.450 --> 17:42.770
I can help you.

17:43.350 --> 17:46.820
I can help you talk to him if you like. It might be really good for you.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.470
No. No. It--it-- please go.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.790
Candace,he needs you.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.890
No. I--I can'T. Not after...  please leave.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.710
You ok?

18:21.800 --> 18:25.440
Hey,uh...where's the little ooh?

18:25.630 --> 18:29.910
Front room. Can I just say I am-- I am so sorry about lunch.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.240
I thought you said this was gonna be an easy one.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.780
Well,it should've been. I was kenny's mother today.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.630
Whoa. How'd that go?

18:35.690 --> 18:39.010
Oh,she's tough... very tough.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.890
She doesn't want to talk to him. There's something else going on. I just don't know what.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.010
Hey. Sleep on it. Ok?

18:45.140 --> 18:48.860
Come on. My mother likes her food hot. She's weird that way.

18:50.110 --> 18:52.010
The wedding album could've been so lovely.

18:52.210 --> 18:53.740
It's a shame about your photographer.

18:53.970 --> 18:55.140
What do you mean,mom?

18:55.380 --> 18:59.330
Well,he ruined some of the best family shots. I mean,look at that white glare.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.270
--Dan. 
--Really?

19:07.410 --> 19:09.250
What about dan?

19:10.300 --> 19:13.530
we were just thinking how much dan would've enjoyed being at the wedding.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.240
Yes. Dan would've loved seeing his little brother tie the knot.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.170
So,melinda,I hear you're a wonderful businesswoman.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.780
Tell me about this shop of yours.

19:23.950 --> 19:26.150
Well,it'S... something I've always wanted to do.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.180
I've always been fascinated with antiques and the old stories behind them,

19:30.750 --> 19:32.260
so when my grandmother died--

19:32.360 --> 19:34.790
Oh. Wow. That's surprising.

19:34.890 --> 19:37.440
--Uh,it's the tv. It's,um... 
--on the fritz.

19:37.790 --> 19:40.050
--Let's fix it. 
--Ok. Yeah.

19:41.670 --> 19:44.660
--Kenny. Honey,did you touch the remote? 
--Nope.

19:44.810 --> 19:45.970
Who's that?

19:46.140 --> 19:47.330
Oh,this is my husband.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.470
Jim,say hello to kenny... on the couch.

19:51.980 --> 19:56.330
--Uh... hi...kenny.
--Hi.

19:59.340 --> 19:59.900
What's goin' on?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.310
I think it's the electromagnetic field messin' with the tv.

20:02.860 --> 20:05.730
--You just...had me talk to a ghost.
--How'd it feel? 

20:05.860 --> 20:06.640
Strange.

20:07.060 --> 20:07.930
Is everything all right?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.770
--Yeah. Great. 
--Fine.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.970
It was an... electrical surge.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.420
You know these old houses.

20:17.510 --> 20:19.660
I think the tv may still be on.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.830
Ruggles likes it.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.960
The cat? How odd.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.140
Keeps him company.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.180
Odd little tabby.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.480
Miraculously walked out of the hospital--

20:30.900 --> 20:32.480
Way inside--

20:33.080 --> 20:34.440
that's one talented cat.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.200
Not comfortable with his motion.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.740
It's a disaster. I was up and down like a yo-yo.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.600
I'm sure she thinks I'm a lunatic.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.680
Oh,don't sweat it. She'll fall in love with you eventually. I mean,what's not to like?

20:45.950 --> 20:47.380
A great deal,apparently.

20:47.740 --> 20:48.860
Where's kenny?

20:49.100 --> 20:54.420
Having a sponge bob marathon at home,which isn't to say that he won't get bored and pop up any minute.

20:55.330 --> 20:58.740
Look... I don't know who you are...

20:58.910 --> 21:02.650
and I don't know what you want,but you stay away from my wife. Understand? And stay away from my home.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.590
Mr. Dale,please,I know that you're upset,but--

21:04.700 --> 21:07.470
she's been crying since you left.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.170
Now,I'm sure you make a pretty good living from your little scam.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.750
--Hey,I don't make any money.
--It's true,sir. She doesn't.

21:13.920 --> 21:14.800
 Let me be clear.

21:15.050 --> 21:19.530
I'm not buying what you're selling. And neither is my wife.

21:19.750 --> 21:20.560
Mr. Dale.

21:20.700 --> 21:25.280
I am sick... of people getting away with their lies!

21:25.440 --> 21:26.400
But you know what?

21:26.460 --> 21:29.840
Every once in a while,somebody pays for it.

21:29.870 --> 21:34.820
So you better think twice before you pull your crap on me,little girl. Understand?!

21:37.500 --> 21:39.720
It's a word of advice.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.650
Maybe this explains it. Court calendar says,

21:52.760 --> 21:59.210
"candace and hank dale vs. Steven pinkus. "Civil law suit charging mr. Pinkus with negligence and reckless endangerment."

21:59.470 --> 22:00.560
Uh,and they lost the case?

22:00.720 --> 22:04.550
So,who's,uh,pinkus? The train conductor?

22:05.390 --> 22:06.900
Hi,andrea.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.610
--What am I,wood?
--Hi,melinda.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.570
Andrea,did you get the rock I gave you wet?

22:12.930 --> 22:14.100
Did I what?

22:14.220 --> 22:16.250
Oh. No...dylan. Not yet.

22:16.550 --> 22:18.210
You should. It looks really cool.

22:18.250 --> 22:22.290
Wow! Limoges demitasse cups and sterling silver holders.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.650
Kenny says there's a whole bunch more down by the railroad tracks.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.140
Demitasse cups?

22:26.270 --> 22:29.090
You're a scream,andrea.I meant rocks.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.000
Kenny said what?

22:30.070 --> 22:32.770
But I'm not going down to the tracks again. No way.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.470
So,uh... kenny's here?

22:34.780 --> 22:38.360
Yeah,but I'm not listening to him 'cause my mom says he's not real.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.650
--I am too real! 
--You are not!

22:40.890 --> 22:44.450
--Mom says you're just in my head. 
--You never listen to your mom.

22:44.510 --> 22:48.140
--Yes,I do! 
--No,you don't! You're mean,and you yell at her!

22:48.330 --> 22:50.970
So what? She still says you're not real,and I believe her!

22:50.970 --> 22:52.900
--You're a fibber.
--Andrea can't even see you.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.400
--So what? She's blind.
--She is not.

22:55.630 --> 22:56.930
 Are you blind,andrea?

22:57.350 --> 22:59.410
Blind? No.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.120
So,see? You're not really here. You're,like,a ghost or something.

23:03.150 --> 23:07.490
I am not! Melinda,tell dylan I'm not a ghost.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.080
--Kenny... 
--I am not a ghost!

23:13.750 --> 23:15.810
Kenny?

24:01.210 --> 24:03.640
Kenny,I was hopin' your mom could talk to you about this.

24:04.030 --> 24:05.790
About what?

24:08.810 --> 24:11.080
Do you know what it means to die?

24:11.160 --> 24:13.240
I had a turtle that died.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.470
I woke up,and he wasn't there anymore.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.460
I was looking for him,and my dad had told me he died.

24:20.920 --> 24:25.270
He threw him away. I never got to say good-bye.

24:25.510 --> 24:28.560
Is that what's going to happen with me?

24:28.620 --> 24:30.290
No.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.300
Honey,it isn'T.

24:34.910 --> 24:37.860
I hardly remember that turtle.

24:38.220 --> 24:43.000
Everyone will remember you,kenny. I promise.

24:43.020 --> 24:46.250
No one who knows you,who loves you,will ever forget you.

24:46.900 --> 24:51.700
You can't be with them anymore,not the way you used to be,but...

24:52.220 --> 24:56.330
there's a part of you in your mom and dad and sister,just like there's A...

24:57.090 --> 24:59.040
there's a part of them in you.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.830
Nothing will ever change that.

25:01.020 --> 25:03.720
So I won't get to see them again...

25:04.340 --> 25:06.950
mommy and daddy and my sister?

25:07.040 --> 25:09.290
You'll get a chance to say good-bye.

25:10.060 --> 25:11.510
They'll know that you love them.

25:12.030 --> 25:14.150
But I don't want to say good-bye.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.960
Then I'll be alone.

25:17.190 --> 25:21.100
No. No,you won't be. I promise you that.

25:21.340 --> 25:23.420
I can help you go where you need to go.

25:23.530 --> 25:25.660
And there'll be people there,people who...

25:26.470 --> 25:29.080
will know you,people who'll take care of you.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.470
You think they'll remember... mommy and daddy?

25:32.550 --> 25:35.160
For the rest of their lives.

25:36.950 --> 25:40.020
There you are!What are you doing here?

25:43.120 --> 25:46.640
Um... I was,uh... meditating.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.860
--I picked up some fun little gifts for my friends. 
--That's great.

25:49.870 --> 25:53.440
Just silly little things. You know.We always do that when one of us goes away.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.540
I mean,look at these. I got them at the flea market.

25:57.870 --> 25:59.770
Aren't they cute?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.140
Melinda?

26:15.210 --> 26:17.150
Melinda! Are you all right?

26:17.240 --> 26:22.940
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I--I... I just thought this is adorable!

26:27.030 --> 26:29.140
I think I understand what's going on here.

26:29.430 --> 26:30.060
You do?

26:30.110 --> 26:33.860
Sweetheart,your behavior is fairly transparent.

26:35.030 --> 26:38.020
Is there something you'd like to tell me?

26:38.240 --> 26:40.020
Oh...faith,there is a lot...

26:40.040 --> 26:43.160
I would like to tell you. It's just now's not the right time. I hope you understand.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.000
Of course!

27:07.050 --> 27:08.900
Kenny?

27:14.460 --> 27:16.930
Are you mad,mommy?

27:33.370 --> 27:34.940
Daddy.

27:39.190 --> 27:44.510
Are you waiting for me? I'm here. I'm home.

27:46.570 --> 27:49.330
Daddy,I'm sorry.

27:51.180 --> 27:53.730
I didn't mean to leave you.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.740
Don't cry,daddy.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.680
We-- we didn't find him.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.380
I did. He ran off again,though.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.470
dylan,where've you been? I told you not to cross the square.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.570
I was on a hunt with andrea!

28:32.770 --> 28:34.330
Go back to the store.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.130
You took him without asking my permission?

28:38.170 --> 28:40.170
You know,we were on the square the entire time.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.580
You don't get it. I'm trying to teach him rules.

28:42.820 --> 28:45.170
And I don't want him in your shop anymore,either.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.250
Hey. Wait. Wait. Look. Ok,I didn't mean any harm.

28:51.240 --> 28:54.630
I hope you won't punish dylan for my bad judgment.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.560
Hello?

29:00.290 --> 29:02.400
He's here. I felt him.

29:04.540 --> 29:07.080
I felt his cheek up against mine. He was...

29:07.420 --> 29:09.470
I've got to talk to him.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.150
He was around... here.

29:11.250 --> 29:15.050
Well,he's not anymore,so give me a minute.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.650
Kenny?

29:38.710 --> 29:41.570
Kenny. You surprised me.

29:43.580 --> 29:46.030
Honey,are you all right?

29:48.630 --> 29:50.620
Kenny?

29:50.710 --> 29:54.050
Daddy's gonna do something bad.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.400
Where's hank?

30:04.520 --> 30:06.200
He left about 10 minutes ago.

30:06.410 --> 30:07.230
Where did he go?

30:07.700 --> 30:12.230
I don't know. Why? What's happening?

30:12.370 --> 30:14.490
Candace,I need you to tell me about the accident.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.950
I know that it's very painful,but I need to know what happened.

30:21.340 --> 30:24.420
Um...I was in the car with the children.

30:24.830 --> 30:28.230
We were...driving home from the fair a few towns away.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.560
Kenny,um... he kept asking for this little toy...

30:32.790 --> 30:34.250
I want my spider!

30:34.260 --> 30:36.920
That he'd gotten at the fair,and...

30:37.330 --> 30:38.610
I was on the phone with hank.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.930
No! I'm gonna take the car back to his house!

30:41.080 --> 30:41.610
Hank was furious.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.870
He'v been promised the car was in perfect condition.

30:45.150 --> 30:49.490
The car had already stalled twice,and I was afraid that it was gonna happen again.

31:00.910 --> 31:02.830
Come on,kenny,go!

31:05.500 --> 31:09.960
I turned to find Kenny and he has gong,he'd back the car and got the spider

31:10.320 --> 31:12.490
Kenny!

31:13.140 --> 31:16.010
Kenny! Kenny!

31:20.130 --> 31:25.240
I'm so,so sorry. I was preoccupied.

31:27.040 --> 31:31.530
Candace,when hank said that he was told the car was in perfect condition...

31:33.280 --> 31:34.330
who told him that?

31:34.350 --> 31:38.600
The man that sold it to us. He was a horrible,arrogant man.

31:38.860 --> 31:39.790
This was the dealer?

31:39.840 --> 31:43.800
No. We got it from the newspaper. A private owner.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.790
We sued him for negligence,but...

31:47.370 --> 31:49.500
we lost the case yesterday.

31:49.710 --> 31:53.000
--So he lied to you. 
--Of course he lied.

31:53.060 --> 31:56.640
"And every once in a while,someone pays for it."

32:07.780 --> 32:13.910
Daddy. Don't be mad,daddy. Let's go home. Ok?

32:29.400 --> 32:30.230
What're you doin' here?

32:30.310 --> 32:32.860
I want to know how it feels to get away with murder.

32:33.140 --> 32:34.210
Get off my property.

32:34.360 --> 32:38.160
Is your family proud of you,pinkus,proud that you killed a 6-year-old child?

32:39.490 --> 32:42.280
You leave my family out of this,dale. And I'm gonna tell you one more time--

32:42.330 --> 32:43.790
Get off my property!

32:46.400 --> 32:49.220
There he is,stop the car!

32:55.800 --> 32:57.490
Make him stop,melinda.

32:58.230 --> 32:58.860
Ok. It's ok.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.580
He killed him! He killed my boy!

33:02.440 --> 33:06.480
This isn't the way. Right? Not now. Come on,not now.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.700
Right. I'm sorry.

33:13.010 --> 33:14.640
Daddy,no!

33:14.770 --> 33:15.900
Aaaiee!

33:16.120 --> 33:18.150
Mr. Dale,don't!

33:21.280 --> 33:22.530
Mr. Dale,kenny's here.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.070
He's watching you,and he doesn't want you to do this.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.900
Shut up with your crap! I'm warnin' you!

33:27.930 --> 33:30.770
Kenny wants you to remember what you used to tell him when he was mad.

33:30.830 --> 33:32.170
Take my mad feelings...

33:32.400 --> 33:35.820
that he should take all of his mad feelings and roll them into a big ball

33:36.090 --> 33:37.600
and then take that big ball and...

33:37.960 --> 33:40.590
kick it hard. Kick it to the moon.

33:40.700 --> 33:44.260
And--and kick it as hard as he can until he... he hits the moon.

33:44.810 --> 33:46.430
That's what he wants you to do right now.

33:46.980 --> 33:50.840
And then it'll get rid of all your mad feelings,and you'll... you'll feel better.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.380
It's gonna be ok,daddy.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.920
It's gonna be ok.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.340
Everything's gonna be ok.

34:31.449 --> 34:33.560
Hank'S... resting.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.850
Thank you... for what you did.

34:37.139 --> 34:39.900
Don't thank me. Thank kenny.

34:40.659 --> 34:42.199
Is he here?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.550
He's right beside me.

34:46.230 --> 34:48.020
I think he's almost ready to go.

34:49.429 --> 34:49.989
Go?

34:50.330 --> 34:54.730
To cross over. A person's spirit needs to be...calm.

34:55.659 --> 34:56.710
He's not upset anymore.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.880
He was angry with me,wasn't he?

34:59.290 --> 35:04.060
No. No,he thought that you were mad at him for getting back in the car.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.500
Oh,kenny,it wasn't your fault.

35:07.360 --> 35:11.800
Mommy should've... mommy should've made sure you weren't in the car.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.380
I should...

35:17.480 --> 35:19.330
I should've...

35:22.850 --> 35:25.610
tell mommy I love her.

35:26.630 --> 35:29.700
Kenny wants you to know that he loves you...

35:29.900 --> 35:32.680
and he doesn't blame you for anything.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.990
He's at peace now.

35:36.150 --> 35:37.230
Do you want to say good-bye to him?

35:37.780 --> 35:39.260
I can'T.

35:39.390 --> 35:41.610
It'll help him so much.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.430
Tell him that he doesn't have to be afraid.

35:46.990 --> 35:49.960
I love you so much,kenny.

35:50.260 --> 35:53.540
And I don't want you to be scared...

35:53.700 --> 35:56.420
because it is so beautiful.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.110
And grandma will be waiting.

35:59.780 --> 36:01.290
And...

36:01.710 --> 36:02.530
stubby?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.290
He wants to know about someone named stubby?

36:07.850 --> 36:08.450
Yes.

36:08.890 --> 36:11.440
Stubby the turtle...

36:12.490 --> 36:14.570
...Will be there,too.

36:16.420 --> 36:18.930
I see something really cool.

36:19.390 --> 36:21.170
Is it a light?

36:23.250 --> 36:25.490
He's ready now.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.120
It's ok to go into that light,kenny.

36:35.290 --> 36:37.400
I love you,mommy.

36:42.420 --> 36:45.100
He's gone... isn't he?

36:46.250 --> 36:49.830
Yeah. He's gone.

37:13.160 --> 37:18.160
Dylan... be nice to your mommy.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.490
Mami,I love you

37:35.830 --> 37:37.880
I will naver get out about you

37:41.340 --> 37:43.480
Hello! I'm back.

37:43.790 --> 37:46.650
I just had to go back into town for a little shopping spree.

37:46.740 --> 37:48.010
Oh,another one.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.630
This one is special.

37:49.870 --> 37:53.210
--For us? 
--Yes,indeed. Open them.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.870
Gee! It's a-- it's A...baby dress.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.950
And you two thought you could keep a secret.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.640
I could see through you from the start--

38:04.080 --> 38:10.130
the whirlwind wedding,the hurry to get settled,and mystery trips out of the room during dinner.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.880
Darling,I know what it's like when you're pregnant and nature calls. I remember.

38:14.120 --> 38:14.950
Um...mom...

38:15.390 --> 38:20.610
um,mrs. Clancy... faith...um... I hate to tell you this,but I'm not... pregnant.

38:23.220 --> 38:23.900
You're not?

38:24.400 --> 38:29.870
No. It--it's something we'd like to do down the line... a bit...but,um,

38:29.880 --> 38:33.690
there's no plans for children at the moment. I'm really... sorry.

38:35.120 --> 38:39.920
Well,then,what has been going on this whole time? Why have you two been acting so bizarrely?

38:40.830 --> 38:43.820
I'm sorry,but it's starting to look like extremely bad manners.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.900
Mom,I--I know this weekend's been... kind of strange.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.270
Although actually  all our weekends tend to be strange,but...

38:50.400 --> 38:53.840
faith,I've been a little jumpy... because...

38:55.510 --> 38:59.910
well,because an acquaintance of mine lost her child.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.740
And,um...

39:02.140 --> 39:07.930
some people think that I have this ability to help people during the grieving process,and so that's what I've been doing.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.860
I've been helping this woman and other people involved in this death,and I'm sorry...

39:12.300 --> 39:14.090
that I couldn't tell you because,well...

39:16.100 --> 39:17.340
it's complicated.

39:17.810 --> 39:19.580
I see.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.990
Well,that couldn't have gone worse.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.440
--Tea? 
--Oh. Thanks.

39:39.730 --> 39:41.150
You warm enough?

39:41.300 --> 39:43.420
Just fine. Thank you.

39:45.530 --> 39:46.810
I'm really sorry...

39:48.100 --> 39:53.030
for all the craziness the last few days. It must...must seem so strange to you.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.460
My son loves you very much.

39:58.410 --> 40:01.120
I can see it every time he looks at you.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.310
I know.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.560
And you love him... very much.

40:08.890 --> 40:10.790
I can see that clearly.

40:12.650 --> 40:14.520
I really do.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.170
I just wish you had told me about,um...

40:18.410 --> 40:22.420
about your friend. When you lose like that...

40:23.360 --> 40:26.380
when I lost dan and my husband...

40:26.770 --> 40:29.560
you just have to go on.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.060
There are other people depending on you.

40:32.150 --> 40:36.220
You just have to keep doing the things that have to be done.

40:37.660 --> 40:45.110
You can come off as brusque or judgmental or... just as a big pain in the ass.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.530
But at night...

40:49.520 --> 40:52.990
Just when I think I'm gonna cry...

40:53.080 --> 40:55.430
I feel dan with me.

40:55.510 --> 41:00.330
I feel...jim's father... is with me.

41:00.510 --> 41:05.940
I...really believe that they're out there... watching over me.

41:06.190 --> 41:09.640
I don't think I could go on if I didn't believe that.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.770
Do you understand?

41:13.780 --> 41:14.750
I do.

41:15.030 --> 41:17.460
You may want to share that with your friend.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.820
That may give her some comfort.
