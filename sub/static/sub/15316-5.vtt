WEBVTT

00:09.209 --> 00:10.733
I take it
you're feeling much better.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.175
There's nothing
like the attentions

00:12.278 --> 00:14.473
of a capable physician
to cure the chronically ill.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.843
You were never ill.
It was simply-

00:15.949 --> 00:17.541
An element of my physiology

00:17.650 --> 00:19.413
as yet undiscovered by medicine.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.386
Where to this evening?

00:21.488 --> 00:24.286
A turn through Piccadilly
to start, please.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.454
- You have done so much for me.
- John, I hardly-

00:30.563 --> 00:32.622
Let me speak, Doctor.

00:33.266 --> 00:36.793
I've spent my entire life
lost in a void,

00:36.903 --> 00:38.768
afraid of who I am...

00:39.906 --> 00:41.601
Of what I am.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.404
If not for you,
I fear I would have remained lost.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.572
Instead, I can now see that I am
neither a freak of nature nor a devil,

00:52.719 --> 00:54.482
but a man...

00:59.626 --> 01:00.820
Very much in love.

01:02.962 --> 01:05.556
And someone who wishes to spend
the rest of his life

01:05.665 --> 01:08.259
repaying his savior
for all she's done.

01:15.241 --> 01:22.079
I promise to make you happy,
Helen, for all eternity...

01:36.496 --> 01:38.896
Ah... Ah...

01:39.833 --> 01:41.767
Ah...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.270
Will!

01:56.749 --> 01:58.011
Will!

02:03.056 --> 02:05.616
- You alright?
- Oh... Yeah.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.716
That was... That was bad.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.818
Oh, damn!

02:11.865 --> 02:12.695
Sylvio!

02:13.133 --> 02:13.895
You okay?

02:14.934 --> 02:15.923
What do you think?

02:17.270 --> 02:19.067
Where the hell are we?

02:24.644 --> 02:26.805
To be honest...

02:26.913 --> 02:28.744
...I've no idea.

03:19.032 --> 03:19.896
Allison!

03:25.572 --> 03:27.904
- Are we? Are we?
- It's okay, it's okay.

03:28.007 --> 03:28.905
- It's okay. You're safe.
- That thing!

03:29.075 --> 03:31.202
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Look, it's gone.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.176
It's gone, alright? Look at me.

03:33.279 --> 03:36.146
You're fine. You're fine, okay?

03:36.316 --> 03:40.878
Yeah, that's
very helpful. Tell her she's fine.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.451
Even though we're totally screwed.

03:47.927 --> 03:48.450
Ah!

03:48.561 --> 03:50.654
- Your arm!
- Don't touch me.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.830
I'll do it.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.643
S- see? All better.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.772
- No, no, go away!
- It's alright. It's alright.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.266
You're alive.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.008
- Did we make it?
- We're down, yes.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.139
Looks like your co-pilot
did most of the work, though.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.717
I was in the washroom
when it happened.

04:45.818 --> 04:46.978
I heard screams.

04:47.253 --> 04:51.053
Don't move. Your leg is broken.
I'll tend to it in a moment.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.485
What are you doing?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.089
Getting us out of here.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.289
I can't get a signal.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.005
- Mom? Thank god.
- Ashley. I'm fine.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.645
We lost the pilot,
but the rest of us are okay.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.371
We know. We've been
tracking you the entire time.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.709
- What happened?
- I'll give you the details later!

05:17.817 --> 05:20.718
We have some wounded who need
immediate medical attention!

05:20.887 --> 05:21.819
Okay, we got you.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.185
Sat tracking has the crash site
located in the central Hindu Kush.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.621
We already have a rescue team
mobilizing out of Islamabad.

05:27.794 --> 05:30.024
- ETA should be about five hours.
- Good work!

05:30.196 --> 05:31.356
I'll see you when I get home!

05:31.531 --> 05:32.759
Mom...

05:33.599 --> 05:35.533
It's really good to hear your voice.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.262
It's good to hear yours, too, Ashley.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.601
I have good news.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.738
A rescue team will be here
in about five hours.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.513
In the meantime,
we'll assess your injuries

05:51.617 --> 05:53.380
and try keep you all
as warm as possible,

05:53.553 --> 05:54.986
and if the gods are smiling,

05:55.088 --> 05:57.420
I'll find some tea
and make us all a pot.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.122
See? You'll be back in new Delhi
by breakfast.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.855
I should've guessed
this would be no match

06:03.963 --> 06:05.089
for the great Helen Magnus.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.528
Exactly.
Never doubt the boss.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.398
Magnus! Will...

06:16.542 --> 06:19.636
This is definitely
after the punch line.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.651
- You think it survived the crash?
- We did.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.151
I'm still getting paid, right?

06:31.257 --> 06:33.020
I mean, I did fulfil the contract

06:33.192 --> 06:35.558
to find and capture
one bad-ass snow creature.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.060
- I mean, what happens after that-
- Sylvio, give it a rest, alright?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.493
Start securing the plane.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.226
Do what you can
to block out the cold.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.859
Five hours is a long time to be
exposed to these temperatures.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.129
I'll see what I can dig up.

06:50.610 --> 06:51.907
I know you wanted this one badly.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.137
Not like this.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.337
But at least we know why
no one's captured one before-

06:56.249 --> 06:58.114
They're a hardy breed.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.151
Yeah, and here we are,
stuck on its turf.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.584
I'm not sure I like not knowing
whether that thing is alive or dead.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.042
- Can you understand him?
- It's a dialect of Tibetan.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.940
Wasn't he one of the Sherpas
on the expedition?

07:26.045 --> 07:28.172
Yes, he must have
stowed away on the flight.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.449
- Bad move.
- Your name is Tashi, right?

07:33.352 --> 07:34.284
Can you stand?

07:39.492 --> 07:40.925
It's alright. You're safe.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.186
The thing is gone.
Let me see your hand.

07:45.498 --> 07:46.658
Look after him.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.099
I think you are! I mean, we have
a right to an explanation!

07:50.269 --> 07:53.204
What the hell was that thing?
How did it get in this plane, man?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.933
It was our cargo-

07:55.107 --> 07:57.667
A rare species of snow leopard
we captured in Tajikistan,

07:57.777 --> 07:58.744
north of Dushanbe.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.438
Never heard of a snow leopard
attacking a group of people before.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.573
It was a rare offshoot
of the species.

08:04.684 --> 08:08.176
Its designation
is Cryptid Bipedis Himalaya.

08:08.287 --> 08:11.017
You expect us to believe
that that was a leopard?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.021
That was four times
the size of any cat.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.686
Whatever it was,
it brought the plane down.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.790
Who are you people?

08:18.898 --> 08:21.059
We're with a private
research foundation.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.758
The creature we brought back
was unique,

08:22.869 --> 08:24.803
and I deeply regret
what happened.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.371
Our intention was to transport it
to our facility in New Delhi

08:27.473 --> 08:28.633
run by Dr. Grant here.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.039
I have many such sanctuaries
around the world.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.678
New Delhi was the closest,
and with such dangerous cargo-

08:33.846 --> 08:36.679
Yeah, well, hooray for you
and your safety protocols,

08:36.849 --> 08:38.179
because they worked
like a charm, right?

08:38.351 --> 08:42.219
We didn't mean for this to happen.
We took every precaution possible.

08:42.321 --> 08:44.083
Really? Cause he's dead!

08:44.190 --> 08:46.488
We're stranded here,
and your cargo?

08:46.592 --> 08:47.752
Gone.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.827
Or is it?

08:50.162 --> 08:52.630
- We don't know.
- What does that mean?

08:52.798 --> 08:54.891
That means we could be attacked
at any time-

08:55.067 --> 08:57.058
That is extremely unlikely.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.694
These creatures are incredibly shy
and used to their natural habitat.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.603
If it did survive, it would have sought
refuge higher up the mountain.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.269
Shy? That creature
or whatever the hell it was,

09:06.379 --> 09:07.710
almost killed every one of us!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.679
- And who the hell is he?
- A stowaway,

09:11.784 --> 09:13.479
a Sherpa who helped us
capture the creature.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.247
Oh, really? Well, good for you!

09:15.354 --> 09:16.821
How about you go out there
and do it again!

09:16.923 --> 09:18.356
This time make sure it's dead!

09:18.457 --> 09:21.358
Hey! You obviously have a problem
knowing when to shut up, man.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.665
He wanted to come back with us.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.239
He has family in Peshawar
he hasn't seen in years.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.898
Why not just ask for a lift?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.175
He was afraid
that you would refuse him.

09:43.282 --> 09:47.241
He's very sorry that he deceived you,
and he asks for your forgiveness.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.480
Well, you certainly picked
the wrong flight.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.887
Alright, even though the rescue
will be here soon,

09:51.991 --> 09:53.822
we still need to keep warm.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.656
It will help us with the shock
of what we've just endured.

09:56.762 --> 10:01.028
Everyone, find some tools
and help seal up the plane.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.569
Yes, ma'am.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.839
A storm.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.380
An arctic outflow system
moving into the region really fast.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.882
It's huge.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.350
Rescue teams won't be able
to get into the region

10:54.453 --> 10:56.045
until the weather clears.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.952
The size of this one,
it could take days.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.755
Grab our winter gear.
I'll have Hans get a plane ready.

11:01.861 --> 11:02.850
Wheels up in four hours.

11:03.029 --> 11:06.089
I want us leading the rescue team
the second the weather breaks.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.129
Alright, that ought to do it.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.864
We're not much better off in here.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.705
This is only for a few days,
until the storm passes.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.309
Kid, I've been fixing planes
up here for 15 years.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.935
Winter storms
in this part of the world

11:20.046 --> 11:22.674
are not like the winter storms
in your part of the world.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.080
They can last a few weeks
before they roll out.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.549
A few weeks?

11:26.719 --> 11:28.448
Do you know
what "Hindu Kush" means?

11:29.155 --> 11:31.350
"Slayer of Hindus".

11:31.457 --> 11:32.389
So named by the locals here

11:32.491 --> 11:34.550
because they believe
that the weather and the mountains

11:34.660 --> 11:38.926
were created by God for the sole
purpose of killing people.

11:39.665 --> 11:42.361
Fun place
for a plane crash, huh?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.036
Alright.

11:51.944 --> 11:54.936
That'll do it.
Try to find a place to sleep.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.710
I wasn't hiding, you know...

12:00.152 --> 12:01.881
When it happened.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.621
No one's saying that you were.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.182
You're thinking it.
Everybody's thinking it.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.728
Everyone was terrified.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.296
You weren't.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.925
It's different for me.
I've been doing this for a long time.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.970
You think we crashed
because I wasn't in the cockpit,

12:19.071 --> 12:22.768
that I should have been there,
tried to keep us in the air.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.842
I only had to use
the restroom, alright?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.468
Please...

12:27.246 --> 12:29.544
Try to get some sleep, alright?

12:35.187 --> 12:37.382
Oh, please tell me that that is tea.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.924
Gods are on vacation.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.458
It's coffee.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.528
- Here.
- Pass.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.824
Come on,
it'll help you keep warm.

12:45.931 --> 12:50.163
I have standards, Will.
Drinking coffee? Well below them.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.737
Man, you are a Brit
to the core, aren't you?

12:52.838 --> 12:54.897
And proud of it.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.674
So, uh, taking stock of things.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.273
We don't have a lot of food left,
maybe a day or so,

13:05.384 --> 13:07.784
and the heater fuel is not
going to last much longer either.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.147
Alright.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.416
We'll ration everything
very carefully.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.185
This could be home
for a long while.

13:14.093 --> 13:19.121
Yeah, well, you never know.
This place, a little redecorating...

13:19.231 --> 13:21.256
Probably still feel
like a doomed hellhole.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.958
Is that your way of saying
any port in the storm?

13:25.871 --> 13:27.668
No, it's my way
of coping with the fact

13:27.773 --> 13:29.866
that this is the world's
worst cup of coffee.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.335
Rule Britannia.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.906
What do you want?

14:21.927 --> 14:23.485
My love.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.560
No!

14:44.717 --> 14:46.514
Magnus,
what's happening?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.019
The co-pilot appears
to have committed suicide.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.383
This is crazy.
Why would we he do that?

14:51.490 --> 14:53.048
Just give us some space.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.792
Come on.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.094
Yeah.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.101
Looks like he used
a broken piece of glass.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.962
Why would he just
give up like this?

15:06.138 --> 15:08.732
I mean, I know the rescue
is delayed, but still.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.742
Hardly in keeping
with aviation regulations,

15:11.844 --> 15:14.608
plus he abandoned his post
when the creature attacked.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.908
Who knows what other skeletons
he had in his closet?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.553
What if it wasn't a suicide?

15:23.889 --> 15:25.288
No sign of a struggle.

15:25.457 --> 15:26.685
No screams, cries for help,

15:26.792 --> 15:28.282
any of which
would have woken us up.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.484
Unless he knew his attacker.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.192
You said Strickland felt
people were angry at him

15:35.301 --> 15:38.737
for not helping fly the plane
when the creature attacked.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.494
What if he was right?

15:42.308 --> 15:43.297
Mad enough to kill?

15:43.842 --> 15:47.278
With all of us here,
and absolutely no place to hide?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.005
A bit of a stretch.

15:51.016 --> 15:55.282
Sorry, but you pay me
for my outlandish theories.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.207
Tashi, right?

16:56.315 --> 16:57.509
Toshi?

16:57.616 --> 16:59.584
That's your name?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.277
Sylvio.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.150
Did I ever tell you
about my fiancee, Giselle?

17:06.290 --> 17:09.589
She and I got something
real nice going on.

17:10.662 --> 17:11.856
I hunt monsters.

17:12.031 --> 17:20.063
I catch them and bring them back,
alive or dead, for cash...

17:20.239 --> 17:23.367
Cash I'm using to set
me and my girl up real nice,

17:23.474 --> 17:28.412
so if you stowed away on this plane
to take a shot at me,

17:28.580 --> 17:31.640
or come between me
and the money I'm owed?

17:31.917 --> 17:35.375
Nothing personal,
Sherpa man, but...

17:35.521 --> 17:38.649
I will end you.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.585
Will, stay where you are.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.123
No...

18:13.225 --> 18:14.920
- Just stay put.
- Mom?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.324
Will...

18:16.695 --> 18:18.458
I'll be right back.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.157
Come on. It's getting ugly.

18:23.635 --> 18:24.932
What the hell was that thing?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.299
...to take us all
out in our sleep?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.236
- You tell me.
- What's going on here?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.774
Seems Tashi caught
Mr. Sneaky mechanic here

18:30.876 --> 18:32.844
trying to steal
some of our hardware.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.807
One of my best sellers.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.610
Going to shoot a weapons dealer
with his own gun?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.446
You can see
how the irony is lost on me!

18:41.553 --> 18:43.578
It was for protection,
alright?

18:43.689 --> 18:47.090
Y- you don't think I see
that you're all packing weapons?

18:47.192 --> 18:49.558
I'm just trying to level
the playing field here, people.

18:49.661 --> 18:52.061
It's not even loaded.
Sylvio, let him go.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.995
Mr. Braun, these cases
are our property,

18:54.099 --> 18:55.498
and I'll thank you
to remember that,

18:55.667 --> 18:57.430
even under these
trying circumstances,

18:57.536 --> 19:00.164
and the weapons we carry
are for everyone's protection.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.069
- Then give me a gun.
- That is definitely not happening.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.334
So I'm supposed to sit here

19:04.443 --> 19:05.967
and let one of you
kill me in my sleep?

19:07.146 --> 19:10.479
No, I don't think so.
I'm not going down without a fight.

19:16.588 --> 19:19.216
- Someone shut him up?
- Or I could start with you.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.984
Everyone, get some sleep.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.382
John?

19:49.488 --> 19:56.621
I promise to make you happy,
Helen, for all eternity.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.388
No...

20:28.760 --> 20:30.557
Giselle: Sylvio...

20:32.864 --> 20:34.354
Sylvio...

20:38.270 --> 20:39.862
Giselle?

20:40.038 --> 20:41.562
Hey, baby.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.035
Are you for real, girl?

20:45.944 --> 20:48.242
Kiss me and find out.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.793
I love you, baby.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.659
We've lost
a valuable member of our team.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.798
Severe abdominal laceration,
and he had to have been killed here.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.733
There'd be a mess
if he were moved afterward.

21:45.837 --> 21:48.305
There are no other injuries
of any kind, no defensive wounds.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.204
No, it's like he just
let somebody stab him.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.469
What is wrong
with you people?

21:51.576 --> 21:54.101
We know who killed him.
I mean, come on, look!

21:54.279 --> 21:55.337
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!
- No, look.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.381
- Mr. Braun.
- Calm down.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.475
- He did it, and I can prove it.
Really? How?

22:02.721 --> 22:04.154
Around his neck. Look.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.055
I've seen other Sherpas with that,

22:09.227 --> 22:11.422
ones that believe that the Yeti
is some kind of god.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.623
The order of Pangboche.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.791
A group of Tibetan mystics
who worship the creature

22:15.901 --> 22:17.061
as a protector of the mountains.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.798
So now we know who let the damn
thing loose in the first place.

22:20.906 --> 22:24.740
What more reason
would he need to kill us all?

22:24.976 --> 22:27.968
We tried to steal his people's
damn sacred cow.

22:34.319 --> 22:35.980
Hold on. What is he saying?

22:37.289 --> 22:39.587
He says the medallion
was a gift from his cousin,

22:39.691 --> 22:41.716
that he doesn't
worship the creature,

22:42.427 --> 22:45.123
and why would he help to capture
something only to free it again?

22:45.230 --> 22:49.098
Revenge. To teach us a lesson
so we don't try and hunt it again-

22:49.267 --> 22:50.666
Hold on, hold on.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.931
Now, Tashi claims that he's not part
of this Pangboche order, correct?

22:55.040 --> 22:58.703
And, I'm sorry, but having a medallion
is hardly proof of intent to kill.

22:58.810 --> 22:59.902
Will's right.

23:00.078 --> 23:02.273
We can't condemn a man
because of his beliefs.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.575
Leave him alone.

23:05.717 --> 23:09.209
- I get it. I get it.
- Braun-

23:09.554 --> 23:11.988
You had Sherpa boy kill Strickland,

23:12.090 --> 23:15.082
and then you had him murder
the weapons guy. Why?

23:15.260 --> 23:16.352
Because you owed him money?

23:16.461 --> 23:18.759
So you take me out,
and there you go,

23:18.864 --> 23:20.832
no more witnesses
to your little massacre. Wow.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.866
You're being
completely irrational.

23:23.034 --> 23:24.626
There are still far too many
unanswered questions.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.738
No, no, no, see,
I will not go quietly.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.706
No, no. Go ahead and try,
but I'll fight you.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.244
Jesus, you're nuts...

23:36.448 --> 23:39.611
- I'll go keep an eye on him.
- Take Tashi with you.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.853
Alright, what the hell...

23:47.959 --> 23:48.948
What the hell is going on here?

23:49.060 --> 23:51.688
Why would somebody go on a killing
spree in a stranded plane?

23:51.797 --> 23:53.196
They wouldn't.

23:53.298 --> 23:54.822
Come here.

24:01.006 --> 24:04.066
I need to ask you something,
and it may sound strange.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.268
Oh, believe me, I'm getting
very used to strange.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.746
Have you had any dreams,
hallucinations?

24:11.850 --> 24:14.478
Incredibly vivid,
too real to ignore?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.315
People who couldn't
possibly be there.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.854
And yet you can feel
their presence, yes.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.982
It's tricks of the mind.

24:21.159 --> 24:23.719
Post-traumatic stress,
plus the elevation and exhaustion.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.593
I thought so too at first, but now
I'm beginning to have my doubts.

24:26.765 --> 24:28.357
Why do you say that?

24:32.504 --> 24:34.563
Describe his wounds.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.867
Deep cross-length laceration.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.175
Interesting.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.613
I see a diagonal laceration
from palm to forearm.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.087
What?

24:50.188 --> 24:51.314
Well, how is that possible?

24:51.690 --> 24:53.885
- I mean, one of us has to be right.
- Or we're both wrong.

24:54.059 --> 24:57.392
Something is affecting our minds,
clouding our judgment.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.353
What do you mean,
like mind control?

24:59.865 --> 25:01.799
But there's nobody on this plane
who could-

25:05.504 --> 25:07.199
The creature...

25:08.607 --> 25:09.631
You think it's among us?

25:09.741 --> 25:15.145
And hiding in plain sight, using this
telepathic power to conceal itself.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.181
What, by making itself invisible?

25:17.282 --> 25:18.909
Or by posing as one of us.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.717
It can make us see things
that aren't even real.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.014
But why would it hang around?
I mean, this is its terrain.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.681
Maybe it marked this as its hunting
ground. It sees us as a threat.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.453
Abnormals aren't like humans.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.859
They don't play by the same rules
that we understand.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.827
Clearly it's having an effect on us.

25:33.999 --> 25:37.230
We can't trust anything
that we see or hear or even feel.

25:38.803 --> 25:41.271
But there's got to be some way
of knowing who we can trust.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.343
Wait.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.680
"A hardy breed... "

25:51.883 --> 25:53.874
if its natural habitat
is sub-arctic temperatures,

25:53.985 --> 25:57.386
then it would have to have
a pretty special physiology, right?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.252
Even for an abnormal.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.007
How will this show us anything?
I mean, we don't have any equipment.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.544
We can't do a proper analysis.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.876
On the contrary,
we have exactly what we need.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.744
This creature thrives
in high altitudes

26:25.850 --> 26:27.442
and extremely low temperatures.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.985
It would have to have
some sort of protective protein

26:30.088 --> 26:31.680
or antibody in its blood,

26:31.790 --> 26:34.588
otherwise it would never be able
to survive the harsh conditions.

26:34.693 --> 26:38.595
Now, normal blood will freeze
in temperatures this low in minutes.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.494
My thought is
that the creature's won't.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.963
- How can one of us be-
- It's just a theory, Allison.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.592
Hopefully one we can rule out.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.905
Alright, 10 minutes
should be enough time.

26:58.917 --> 27:02.512
I'm sorry.
This situation is just- I'm...

27:03.288 --> 27:05.984
- I'm trying to stay calm.
- We all are.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.356
And believe me, I've been
in far worse situations than this.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.656
- You have?
- Absolutely.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.924
There was a town of Zombies
in Uganda,

27:14.032 --> 27:17.126
and of course I ran out
of ammunition just as night fell.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.566
Um, a deep sea capsule I was in

27:19.671 --> 27:23.107
was trapped underneath
a gigantic mutated squid,

27:23.274 --> 27:24.764
and there was an escaped lunatic

27:24.876 --> 27:27.640
who was able to turn himself
into a giant ape.

27:28.113 --> 27:29.705
Thanks.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.348
You just made all that up,
didn't you?

27:31.950 --> 27:33.144
Only two of them.

27:33.251 --> 27:37.483
My point is, you just have
to keep trying, no matter what.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.056
That's how we'll stay alive.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.690
So what if your little test
doesn't work? What then?

27:44.796 --> 27:47.697
- We'll try something else.
- Well, hurray, Mr. Positive.

27:47.799 --> 27:48.823
Braun, do me a favor, alright?

27:48.933 --> 27:51.629
Just drop this whole
"I'm angry at the world" routine,

27:51.736 --> 27:53.033
because it's getting very old.

27:53.204 --> 27:54.671
What are you,
some kind of a shrink now?

27:56.775 --> 27:58.367
Yes.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.100
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- So what?

28:00.211 --> 28:03.078
Have you been psychoanalyzing me
the whole time?

28:03.181 --> 28:05.376
What's your prognosis, Doc?

28:05.483 --> 28:07.542
Angry at my mommy?
Didn't get enough toys-

28:07.652 --> 28:10.746
You're afraid, and there's
a lot of that going around,

28:10.855 --> 28:12.413
so it doesn't make you
so special.

28:12.657 --> 28:16.821
No, but it does make me human.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.308
Braun.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.049
I see the same thing.

28:53.631 --> 28:55.861
No, no. No...

28:56.034 --> 28:57.661
Stay calm.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.936
- It isn't me. It isn't me...
- Just calm down.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.201
I'm not the creature.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.071
Just until the rescue arrives.

29:08.179 --> 29:12.912
No. No. You don't have to do this.
I'm not a monster, alright?

29:13.585 --> 29:16.110
I've been seeing things,
yes, okay?

29:16.221 --> 29:18.849
I've been seeing things
that I can't explain.

29:20.191 --> 29:22.284
But that does not
make me a monster.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.224
This is for your own safety
as well as ours.

29:24.395 --> 29:25.384
No, no, no.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.260
Mr. Braun, please,
we really have no choice.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.493
I can't do small spaces.

29:33.304 --> 29:36.432
Please. Please. Please.

29:40.712 --> 29:44.614
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, don't-

29:44.716 --> 29:46.650
Please, please... Please, don't.

29:46.751 --> 29:49.345
Please... I'm not the monster.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.979
Please, I'm not the monster.
Please, please, please!

29:52.924 --> 29:58.453
Please don't! Please, please!
I'm not the monster, please!

30:08.706 --> 30:11.334
I'm not good in...
I'm not good in small spaces.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.104
Oh, please...

30:16.815 --> 30:24.381
I'm human. I'm human like you.
Please. Oh, please, help.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.084
I'm not a monster.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.273
Oh, my god!

31:02.126 --> 31:03.115
Did he see anything?

31:03.228 --> 31:05.958
No, he says he felt like
something overcame him

31:06.064 --> 31:08.294
and made him feel like
he was in a dream,

31:08.399 --> 31:10.526
even though he swears
he was awake the whole time.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.862
But he was right in front
of the compartment.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.904
Did he hear anything?
Did Braun call for help?

31:26.217 --> 31:30.415
He was back in his village.
He was at a celebration.

31:30.521 --> 31:33.251
He was dancing at his wedding
with his wife.

31:37.028 --> 31:41.397
And then he felt like he was
possessed by something evil.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.865
Alright. Tashi, come with us.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.333
It's alright.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.589
Just to clarify, you're not seeing
a monster, right?

32:12.030 --> 32:13.463
Are you?

32:13.631 --> 32:15.258
I wish I was.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.397
How does the guy we I.D.
as the creature

32:17.502 --> 32:19.060
turn out to be its next victim?

32:19.170 --> 32:23.004
Because he's human.
I've just run the test again.

32:30.715 --> 32:34.173
But we both saw it before.
It wasn't frozen.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.480
We saw what the creature
wanted us to see,

32:36.587 --> 32:39.112
in order to throw us off the scent.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.625
I should have anticipated
something like this.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.957
The legends about the creature-
Some call it a skinwalker.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.224
Others say it eats your soul.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.856
Add the fact that no one's
ever caught one before,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.595
and I should have realized the initial
capture went down too easily.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.833
Tashi said that he was
at his wedding, dancing with his wife.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.641
With each kill, it's like we enter
this vivid dream-like state

32:59.744 --> 33:01.803
that distracts us from the events.

33:01.913 --> 33:02.902
It knows exactly what to show us

33:03.014 --> 33:04.777
in order to completely
divert our focus.

33:04.949 --> 33:06.246
But why?

33:06.351 --> 33:09.115
I mean, why is it just hanging around,
picking us off one by one?

33:09.587 --> 33:11.578
Perhaps it has no choice.

33:13.424 --> 33:16.655
It has to be here to survive, too.

33:36.214 --> 33:37.772
What do you see?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.416
Uh...

33:40.551 --> 33:43.520
I see a door off its hinges.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.350
Touch it.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.834
Now, try to see
what's really there.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.170
- I see a lock.
- I don't.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.147
There's no lock.

34:14.085 --> 34:15.813
There's no damage.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.652
The door was open
the entire time?

34:21.759 --> 34:25.627
- The less we use our eyes...
- The more we see.

34:26.397 --> 34:30.128
Okay, okay, so, uh, what are we
not looking for, then?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.632
There.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.735
These couldn't have been made
by the creature we believe we saw.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.534
It barely had enough room
to move in here,

34:37.708 --> 34:39.072
and its claws were
four times this size.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.270
And don't cold weather mammals
moult under stress?

34:41.478 --> 34:43.413
There's no sign
of any fur in here.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.415
So there never was
a 400-pound Yeti.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.916
These scratches were made
by something much smaller,

34:49.087 --> 34:50.714
almost human sized.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.187
It just made us think
we were dealing

34:52.290 --> 34:53.917
with something
far more intimidating,

34:54.025 --> 34:57.483
likely whatever our subconscious
dictated it would be.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.689
Okay, so if what we saw before
was just a Jedi mind trick,

35:00.798 --> 35:02.390
what the hell does
this damn thing look like?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.968
I have no idea,
but it's a good bet

35:05.069 --> 35:06.969
that it's as vulnerable
to the cold as we are,

35:07.071 --> 35:09.562
hence its need to blend in
among us in order to survive.

35:11.442 --> 35:14.900
- Magnus, how do I know that-
- I'm me?

35:15.012 --> 35:16.707
- Yeah.
- You don't.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.577
Nor am I certain
that you're you.

35:18.749 --> 35:21.115
The creature could be
any one of us.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.444
I keep thinking there must be
some way of telling, you know?

35:23.554 --> 35:26.387
A way knowing
if the person's really them.

35:26.557 --> 35:28.457
For the moment, we'll just have
to rely on the little things.

35:28.626 --> 35:29.593
Like the fact that the real you

35:29.694 --> 35:31.889
wouldn't insult me
by giving me false hope.

35:32.063 --> 35:35.396
Or the fact you keep offering me
that horrible brown sludge to drink.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.999
You know, that thing's
never attacked two of us at once,

35:43.441 --> 35:46.239
which means it's only powerful
enough to handle one of us at a time.

35:46.344 --> 35:48.005
So alone, we're vulnerable.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.409
We stay close, we live.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.115
I'll take first watch.

35:54.952 --> 35:57.785
Alright, this is the last
gas canister.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.616
It's going to get cold tonight.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.087
Will, stay where you are.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.719
Just stay put.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.421
Mom...

36:40.531 --> 36:42.055
I'll be right back.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.377
They're...

37:00.551 --> 37:01.950
They're here.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.079
Hey! Hey, they're here!
They're here!

37:08.159 --> 37:09.091
Hey!

37:09.193 --> 37:10.751
Heard you guys
were looking for a lift?

37:10.861 --> 37:13.159
- Ashley!
- It's good to see you, big guy!

37:13.264 --> 37:15.596
Okay, we only get
a short break in the storm,

37:15.700 --> 37:17.634
so let's get you guys
out of here, pronto!

37:17.735 --> 37:20.329
- Okay!
- I'll help the others.

37:24.041 --> 37:27.272
- Will, come on!
- Okay!

37:38.389 --> 37:39.856
Will, come on, move it!

37:45.529 --> 37:46.894
This isn't real.

37:47.064 --> 37:48.725
Put on your harness!

37:50.935 --> 37:52.232
You're not real!

38:21.399 --> 38:23.299
Allison!

38:33.210 --> 38:34.438
No!

39:02.640 --> 39:03.800
Did you ever love me?

39:06.210 --> 39:08.735
I mean, truly love me?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.181
You know I'm just an element
of your subconscious mind,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.183
so feel free
to be completely frank.

39:19.023 --> 39:23.858
When I first knew you at Oxford,
I loved you with my entire being.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.660
Those were passionate times,

39:29.767 --> 39:31.564
gone too quickly...

39:34.105 --> 39:36.630
Followed by very dark days.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.505
You destroyed my heart, John.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.674
Even though I understood
why you had changed, your ailment,

39:44.882 --> 39:47.544
the hatred you felt towards me,

39:48.719 --> 39:50.448
and then the way
you would harm our daughter.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.452
Let me make it up to you.

39:54.692 --> 39:57.525
I need you to wake up.

39:58.596 --> 39:59.563
Now!

40:02.032 --> 40:02.794
Hey.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.268
You alright?

40:05.369 --> 40:08.202
You look like you were
having a hell of a dream.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.275
I must have dozed off.
Is everything-

40:14.478 --> 40:17.970
Everything's fine, though you were
supposed to be keeping watch.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.310
I'll take over if you want.

40:29.427 --> 40:33.761
- Magnus!
- Will. stay where you are.

40:37.868 --> 40:38.596
Mom?

40:39.670 --> 40:41.900
We never got a chance to talk.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.970
Talk with me, Will.

40:46.577 --> 40:47.635
You're not real.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.636
Does that really matter?

40:49.814 --> 40:52.044
You died when I was eight!

40:53.250 --> 40:54.945
You don't even know me anymore!

40:55.519 --> 40:57.919
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.957
Stay with me.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.101
I can't.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.797
Will?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.208
I can't!

41:20.845 --> 41:24.008
Seriously, you should
get some sleep. I got your back.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.689
I'm chilled to the bone.

41:38.796 --> 41:40.991
Could you make me
something hot to drink?

41:41.098 --> 41:43.760
Yeah, sure. I'll make some tea.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.899
- I'd prefer coffee.
- Of course.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.885
You finally got one.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.358
The first capture ever.

42:18.736 --> 42:20.101
Hell of a cost.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.934
That's beyond ugly.

42:41.525 --> 42:43.857
How did you know it wasn't me?

42:44.595 --> 42:48.258
Like I said,
it's the little things.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.464
The less we use our eyes...

42:55.072 --> 42:57.404
Welcome to reality.

43:00.177 --> 43:02.168
I'm happy to be here.
