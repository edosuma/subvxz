01:11.780 --> 01:13.698
Door number one or door number two?

01:13.782 --> 01:17.076
- What do you got?
- Let's take a moment to reminisce.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.995
- Ari, come on.
- What's in the envelope?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.247
Behind door number one

01:21.331 --> 01:23.249
is an Aquaman check

01:23.333 --> 01:25.293
with two million little fishies on it.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.628
Hopefully, this will take care
of your delinquent

01:27.713 --> 01:29.756
heating and electric bills.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.925
- We'll take door number one.
- Wait, wait, wait. Let's take a moment

01:33.010 --> 01:35.470
to celebrate how far we've come, all right?

01:35.554 --> 01:38.890
First check I ever got for you, $668, for what?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.850
- A guest star on JAG.
- Guest star on JAG,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.644
- and I did not take commission.
- No, you did not.

01:43.729 --> 01:47.315
- This time I will.
- What's behind door number two, Ari?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.192
- Door number two is a list.
What list?

01:49.276 --> 01:51.652
James Cameron's list for Aquagirl,

01:51.737 --> 01:53.780
five of the hottest actresses on the planet,

01:53.864 --> 01:56.032
one of which you will be stuck

01:56.116 --> 01:58.993
in a water tank with for nine months.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.288
Even if you look like
our skim milk-colored friend E here,

02:02.372 --> 02:05.374
you still have a good shot
of swimming in-between her legs.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.168
Wait, E. We'll save it for the beach,

02:07.252 --> 02:08.669
have something to talk to the guys about.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.798
You don't talk about politics
at the beach? Pretty cool, huh?

02:11.882 --> 02:14.801
Lt'd be a lot cooler
if you gave us the check, Ari.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.636
- I'm gone.
- Where you running to?

02:16.720 --> 02:20.139
It's a day of beauty for me.
I'm going in front of the cameras.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.850
What are you doing,
agency yearbook photos?

02:22.935 --> 02:24.185
Actually, I made a little list of my own.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.604
Fade In magazine's Top 40 Under 40.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.232
Sandwiched in between
The O. C. 's creator Josh Schwartz

02:29.316 --> 02:33.152
and Miramax's Meryl Poster,
at number nine, is yours truly.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.322
Don't worry about it, E.
When they do a top 40 under four feet,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.407
boom, top of the list.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.543
Holy shit. Are we gonna go cash this?

02:48.627 --> 02:51.838
- Not now. We're on our way to Malibu.
- Malibu? I booked a massage.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.632
So cancel it.
I'll have Turtle give you a rubdown.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
What the hell's in Malibu?

02:58.220 --> 03:02.181
Marcel, cancel my 11:00 deep-tissue, please.
Thank you.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.100
Fuckin' Malibu.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.043
Who has a party at 10:00 A.M.
On Wednesday anyway?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.962
I hope they have an omelet chef.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.631
- This place looks empty.
- Maybe people came by boat.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.842
Boy, you guys sure do complain a lot.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.138
- Where'd you get a key?
- Jessica Alba gave it to me.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.977
- She gave you a key to her house?
- No, she gave me the house.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.521
Well, us, at least for the next couple months.

03:50.606 --> 03:53.065
- What do you mean?
- I told her our house

03:53.150 --> 03:55.985
was under construction.
She's off shooting the new Fantastic Four.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.737
She said we can stay here

03:57.821 --> 03:59.739
as long as we take care of the cats.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.326
How many cats are there?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.912
You're telling me
we're gonna live by the beach.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.873
This is sick. This is like Far Rockaway
minus the crack whores.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.334
I think it blows.
How am I gonna get to my auditions?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.044
The P.C.H. Is like a parking lot.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.046
You can stay at our house if it's easier.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.839
By myself?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.341
Fuck that.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.846
Fucking cats.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.892
You missed, motherfucker.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.644
Come on.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.396
- Fuck.
- Too slow, hombre. Let's go.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.815
Take it easy.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.652
You flinched. It's a freebie. Come on.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.783
God!

04:43.867 --> 04:45.952
What do you guys think of
Cameron Diaz for Aquagirl?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.662
- Love her.
- Fuck that.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.081
She got a boyfriend. Upside is you bang her,

04:50.165 --> 04:52.500
he gets pissed off. Downside is she's loyal.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.627
Who wants to make a movie
with someone you have no shot at?

04:54.711 --> 04:57.046
- He's got a point.
- Jennifer Garner.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.507
- Love her.
- Boyfriend!

05:00.968 --> 05:03.886
Kirsten Dunst?
- She already fucked a superhero.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.805
- She's single though.
- Who else you got?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.807
Mandy Moore?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.977
- You flinched, Drama.
- Bullshit. I was reacting to Mandy.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.229
You did a few weeks on A Walk to Remember.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.148
- Did you like her?
- Yeah, she was great.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.317
Come on. We're not gonna get
into this whole thing again.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.487
- What whole thing?
- There is no "whole thing. "

05:21.571 --> 05:23.489
Did you go out with Mandy Moore?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.825
Yeah, I mean, a couple times.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.120
- It was no big deal.
- I never heard about that.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.831
You were still spinnin' pizzas back East.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.333
- So what's the deal?
- Nothing. We went out

05:34.418 --> 05:37.003
for a little while and,
like everything does, it ended.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.047
- So she hates you.
- Nah, I don't think she hates me.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.009
Come on.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.845
She probably hates ya.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.347
How do they not have Froot Loops?

05:48.432 --> 05:49.890
You can't get anything in Malibu

05:49.975 --> 05:51.559
because it's impossible to get deliveries.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.352
You make it like we're in the Far East, Drama.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.939
I know Malibu. One second
it's no Froot Loops, the next

05:57.024 --> 06:00.359
a mudslide is slinging a 400-Ib. Boulder
through your dining room.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.112
Okay, let's see, what else
do we need? Essentials.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.823
More protein, man. We gotta bulk Vince up.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.700
Seriously, Aquaman is fuckin' yoked.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.035
Where is Vince, anyway?

06:09.119 --> 06:11.203
I left him on aisle nine with that MILF.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.372
He's probably banging her
in the produce section.

06:13.457 --> 06:17.084
Look, guys, Cameron wants
a more fluid swimmer than bulky,

06:17.169 --> 06:19.587
so don't go gettin' Vince's head all fucked up.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.338
If you don't want Vince's head fucked up,

06:21.423 --> 06:23.382
make sure Mandy Moore
doesn't get this movie.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.927
- Seriously, that will drown Aquaman.
- Why? What he do to her?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.180
To her? It's what she did to him.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.515
She crushed him, bro. Crushed him.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.185
Come on, I've never seen
Vince hurt over a girl.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.229
It got ugly, E.
He was doing drive-bys to her house,

06:37.314 --> 06:39.231
- late night hang-ups.
- He made a mix tape.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.901
- Bullshit.
- No, I swear! You remember that?

06:41.985 --> 06:44.403
- He led it off with Tiny Dancer.
- Elton John?

06:44.488 --> 06:46.906
Him and Mandy saw
Almost Famous like 20 times.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.116
Now I know you're fuckin' with me.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.744
Mandy Moore is Aquaman's kryptonite, bro.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.037
Trust me.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.289
Yo, that woman has Froot Loops!

06:55.624 --> 06:58.667
She probably got the one box
that was able to make it out.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.795
- It's Dr. Joyce Brothers.
- Oh, yeah?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.090
Drama, go distract her.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.966
Don't make a scene out here, Drama.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.010
There's only two markets in Malibu.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.764
Are you kiddin'? With this performance,
she won't notice a thing.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.266
- Dr. Brothers?
- Yes.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.769
- Hi, I'm a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.354
This is kind of embarrassing,

07:18.438 --> 07:21.774
but sometimes I wake up
in the morning fully-tented.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.402
- Any advice?
- At your age, consider yourself lucky.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.987
My age?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.448
How fuckin' old do you think I am?

07:29.533 --> 07:32.451
What are you guys leaving me
with that crazy mother for?

07:32.536 --> 07:34.787
- Looked like you were having fun.
- The lady was nuts,

07:34.871 --> 07:37.206
- told me she wanted to take me home.
- You serious?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.459
It's total lawlessness out here.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.044
Yeah, hello?

07:42.129 --> 07:45.631
- Johnny. Johnny?
- Hello? I can't hear you!

07:45.715 --> 07:48.217
Fuckin' Malibu. I get no reception out here.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.969
Lighten up, Johnny, I can hear you fine.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.804
- Hey, Adam.
- I know it's last minute,

07:51.888 --> 07:55.641
but I got a Hallmark M.O.W.
Joe Mantegna, Tess Harper.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.519
You know what Hallmark means, right?
It means Emmy.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.313
I always did want one of those winged angels.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.648
You're in at 2:15.

08:02.732 --> 08:07.319
15? It's 11:00 A.M. I'm in Malibu.
I can't do that.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.738
- Can you make it like around 5:00?
- Come on, Johnny.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.283
You can get this. Now drive like the wind.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.954
- What do you got?
- Movie of the week with Joe Mantegna.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.707
- Joe Montana's acting?
- Joe Mantegna, dickhead.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.333
Who wants to take a ride into town with me?

08:21.418 --> 08:23.836
Sorry, Johnny.
Got a scuba lesson. Take Turtle.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.005
Come on, Vince! I want to learn to scuba.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.632
- You know how buoyant I am.
- Come on, Turtle.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.135
All right.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.596
But you owe me a flinch from before.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.056
All right, fine. Hurry up, get it over with.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.933
I only need one.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.942
I love that shit!

08:49.779 --> 08:50.905
You got Gold.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.074
Do you really answer the phone
that way or did you see it was me?

08:54.159 --> 08:57.536
Don't tilt your head. You can't hold
the phone when I'm cutting your hair.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.580
- Lloyd, come hold the phone.
- You're impossible today.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.373
You're impossible, my man.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.459
Dana Gordon, the second love of my life,

09:03.543 --> 09:06.295
- what can I do for you?
- Look, I have a little heads up,

09:06.379 --> 09:09.048
but it's for your ears only.
Swear you won't tell anyone.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.300
Did I tell anyone that your first girl-girl sex

09:11.384 --> 09:13.385
was with someone from must-see TV in '95?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.929
- Okay, Ari, please.
- Spill it.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.181
I'll swallow a cyanide tablet
if they capture me.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.935
Okay. Mandy Moore has moved
to the top of the list, all right?

09:21.019 --> 09:24.021
James sat down with her and he loves
her skin tone next to the water.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.899
- Is that official?
- We're ready to make an offer.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.277
But here's the thing.
I know that Vince and Mandy dated.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.614
- Did you know that?
- I know everything about my clients.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.824
Well, then will you tell me what you know

09:35.909 --> 09:38.160
about the Walk to Remember incident?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.621
Why am I doing this anyway?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.456
You're part of the team, that's why.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.959
Yeah, well, it's not natural
to breathe underwater.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.585
You didn't have a problem in the pool.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.087
A pool's a pool.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.297
Ocean's an ocean. No sharks in the pool.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.299
Don't worry.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.094
If we come across any sharks,
you got Aquaman to protect you.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.971
Wow. That's comforting.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.395
- Hey.
- Where are you?

10:04.479 --> 10:06.105
Just heading to Vince's scuba lesson.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.565
Ah, scuba.
Sport normally reserved for the rich,

10:08.650 --> 10:10.401
but you get free lessons from a Navy Seal

10:10.485 --> 10:11.819
because you happen to have been born

10:11.903 --> 10:13.529
- next door to Vince.
- What's up, Ari?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.407
Do you know anything
about Vince and Mandy Moore?

10:16.491 --> 10:19.118
- No.
- A Walk to Remember?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.120
- What about it?
- Well, apparently

10:21.204 --> 10:23.205
they had to shut the production
down for two days

10:23.290 --> 10:25.624
because Vince was harassing her?

10:25.709 --> 10:27.376
The studio's very concerned.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.420
You know what? I'll call you back, Ari.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.214
Listen, they want her,
but if this causes a problem for Vince,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.800
I will squash it.
James Cameron does not want

10:34.884 --> 10:38.053
- a mopey Aquaman.
- Look, I said I'll call you back.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.555
You better do it quickly, 'cause normally

10:39.639 --> 10:41.307
I would not care if you drown,

10:41.391 --> 10:43.225
but I need an answer right away.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.519
What happened?

10:46.688 --> 10:48.605
They want to offer the movie to Mandy Moore.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.399
Interesting.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.083
Fucking Malibu!

11:27.812 --> 11:30.189
Look, all I'm asking is

11:30.273 --> 11:31.523
what happened with you and Mandy.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.650
I told you, we went out for a little while.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.111
- The guys say she crushed you.
- I wouldn't say "crushed. "

11:36.196 --> 11:38.280
Oh, no? Well, Turtle says
you made her a mix tape.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.908
So full of shit.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.328
Yeah, all right. I made her a mix tape.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.872
- I didn't send it though.
- The studio knows you went out.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.832
- They're concerned.
- What are they concerned about?

11:48.917 --> 11:51.168
Some kind of an incident
on A Walk to Remember.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.753
Like what?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.130
Ari said they shut down
production for two days

11:55.215 --> 11:57.132
'cause you were harassing her.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.551
- And you believe that?
- No, of course not.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.513
I mean, did they shut down production?

12:02.597 --> 12:04.848
Did they shut down production?

12:04.933 --> 12:07.267
Oh, yeah. They did shut down production.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.228
The crew ate bad clams.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.231
Look, the bottom line is, if you want,
we can get her off the movie.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.024
E, this has been like five years already.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.442
This is a stupid conversation.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.860
I haven't even thought about her

12:16.945 --> 12:18.362
till her name was mentioned this morning.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.364
Will you pop the trunk?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.032
Hey, gents, who's ready

12:22.117 --> 12:23.617
for the first open ocean dive?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.577
- Hey, what's up, Dale?
- I'll tell you what's up.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.163
Mr. Cameron wants you
ocean ready in two weeks,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.541
and that means the kiddy pool is history.

12:30.625 --> 12:34.044
Now, E, if you can't handle this, tell me now.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.171
I don't think I can handle it.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.882
When did you become such a pussy?

12:38.967 --> 12:41.343
4- H camp, '85. You don't remember that?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.345
I almost drowned in the undertow.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.139
Oh, yeah? The lake had an undertow?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.349
Now, E, you ought not
to sweat this small stuff.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.643
I have revived people on seven continents,

12:49.727 --> 12:52.271
and never lost... Actually, I did lose one,

12:52.355 --> 12:54.940
but that was in Antarctica,
and I blame it on the cold.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.567
Now get your gear and let's go.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.947
I'm gonna be late. I'm gonna miss this.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.366
Would you calm down?
I'm driving like a champ.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.326
Let me out.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.911
How are you gonna audition like that?

13:08.079 --> 13:09.538
You're sweating like an animal!

13:13.877 --> 13:15.169
Damn, I knew it!

13:16.629 --> 13:18.881
Johnny, we were just about to close up shop.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.091
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.
- Sorry, Sheila.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.676
I came in all the way from Malibu.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.430
All the way from Malibu?
You must be exhausted.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.515
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.394
Johnny Chase.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.457
Let's try and not have
another incident like last year,

13:53.541 --> 13:55.083
huh, John?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.793
Thanks.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.631
All I'm saying is, this is the most
important movie of your career.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.383
I'm not sure you wanna take a chance
of fucking it up over some girl.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.345
Hey, Eric, this could be the most
important movie of her career,

14:06.429 --> 14:09.139
and you wanna fuck that up
because you think I can't handle it?

14:09.224 --> 14:11.850
Look, I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about you.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.852
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.064
The fact that we're even
talking about this is nuts!

14:17.148 --> 14:20.359
Hey! You two sweethearts
wanna shut the fuck up

14:20.443 --> 14:21.985
and focus on the ocean?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.862
I just got off the horn with the coast guard.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.782
They said there's a high shark alert
between now and noon.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.659
Mr. Cameron wants to do this anyway,

14:28.743 --> 14:32.287
so that means you're gonna have to
keep you head up and swiveling.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.789
Are you fucking with us?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.291
Yeah, I'm fucking with you.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.834
But I wasn't fucking with you

14:37.919 --> 14:39.836
about that guy who croaked in Antarctica,

14:39.921 --> 14:41.380
so stay alert.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.423
Now, get over here and get your shit on.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.093
And besides, if James Cameron

14:46.177 --> 14:48.095
wants her in the movie, she's in the movie.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.391
Fucking incident!

14:52.475 --> 14:53.892
That's what this prick says to me!

14:53.977 --> 14:56.061
Davies set me up.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.563
What's this guy doing up my ass?

14:57.647 --> 14:59.898
Don't you know the expression
"Never drive angry"?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.775
And this beady-eyed little jerk-off

15:01.859 --> 15:05.070
just sitting on his Sidekick again,
just goading me!

15:05.154 --> 15:07.698
He probably wasn't even talking to anyone.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.324
Get off my ass! Go around me!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.368
Would you pull over and let me drive?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.579
Do you really find it necessary

15:13.663 --> 15:16.039
to drive up my ass?

15:16.124 --> 15:18.083
Fuck you, dude.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.168
"Dude"? Do you believe this guy?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.753
Fucking locals!

15:21.838 --> 15:23.547
Fuck you, townie!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.134
Asshole!

15:27.218 --> 15:29.845
Take it easy, Drama. Do we really need
a midday fight right now?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.471
Why don't you get out of the car

15:31.556 --> 15:33.765
- and say it to my face, fucker!
- Drama, come on!

15:33.850 --> 15:37.019
Why are we picking a fight with
Point Break? Let's just get out of here.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.354
Why don't you do yourself a favor,
tough guy?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.190
Get back in your car
before someone gets hurt.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.027
Weren't you on TV or something before?

15:45.820 --> 15:46.862
Yeah, I was.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.323
Yeah, like 20 fucking years ago!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.784
- That's it.
- Go do it, man.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.753
What the fuck you doing?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.380
What are you doing to my car?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.216
What the fuck are you doing to my car?

16:09.552 --> 16:11.261
Drama, your phone's ringing.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.555
- Pick it up!
- That's my car, dude!

16:14.223 --> 16:15.766
Hey, Adam.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.644
No, he can't come to the phone.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.521
It's your agent, you booked the gig!

16:21.606 --> 16:23.023
I booked it?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.150
You booked it, motherfucker!
We'll call you back.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.860
Yes!

16:26.944 --> 16:28.153
- I booked it!
- Drop the club!

16:28.237 --> 16:30.364
- Thank God!
- Step away from the car, now!

16:33.868 --> 16:35.327
Hey,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.204
you guys like Joe Mantegna?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.838
- What happened?
- What happened is,

16:46.923 --> 16:49.174
I just got an M.O.W. For NBC!

16:49.258 --> 16:51.343
We're both working men now, kid.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.804
I think what he means
is why did you get arrested, Drama?

16:53.888 --> 16:55.389
The lunatic went Jack Nicholson

16:55.473 --> 16:57.766
on some poor guy's car.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.476
I hope you didn't use my nine-iron.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.353
No, I used E's Calloway.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.021
He's got a court date next week.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.190
If you're lucky, Vince,
they'll put him away for life.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.068
This is gonna be all over the papers.
There's no way to stop it.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.444
Good. People will think my brother's tough,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.823
know not to fuck with me.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.367
- Hey.
- Hey, did Drama get his salad tossed?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.828
Stop fantasizing, Ari.
What's going on? Is Mandy Moore in?

17:17.912 --> 17:20.122
The offer went out, but get this...

17:20.205 --> 17:22.207
She wants to have dinner with me?

17:22.290 --> 17:23.709
Yeah, she wants to make sure

17:23.792 --> 17:26.086
it's not gonna be awkward
before she says yes.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.422
Of course it's gonna be awkward, Vince.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.424
This girl ruined your youth!

17:30.508 --> 17:32.676
You're the star. Tell them you don't want her.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.303
I'm gonna tell Davies I want a say
who's playing my love interest.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.930
Why don't you get Lorenzo Lamas, Drama?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.807
So you're telling me she'll pass

17:38.891 --> 17:40.600
on a James Cameron movie if it's awkward?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.728
Jesus Christ, Vince,
what did you do to this girl?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.604
Nothing! Shauna, you remember.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.565
I remember you living on the break-up diet

17:46.649 --> 17:48.817
of canned tuna and saltines.
You dropped 15 Ibs.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.652
You looked like fucking
Adrian Brody in The Pianist.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.612
I'm starting to get annoyed by all of you.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.323
I have no feelings about this at all.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.993
And besides,
she's got a very serious boyfriend,

17:58.077 --> 18:00.662
so there's nothing wrong
if she wants to sit down.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.290
So we're gonna sit down.
Set up the meeting, E.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.460
Vince?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.795
- She don't have a boyfriend.
- What are you talking about?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.422
She's dating that big real estate guy.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.008
They broke up.
They had a big fight over a cockroach.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.634
She threw a mojito in his face.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.928
- You were there?
- No, I read about it in US Weekly.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.681
- Is this true?
- I heard something about it,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.600
but you know what?
She's got a shitty publicist,

18:21.684 --> 18:23.351
or that would have never made the papers.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.936
You know what? Whatever.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.689
Either way, set up the dinner. I'll show up.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.611
Is the script in the frame?
It's cool, right here?

18:32.695 --> 18:35.238
I want to make sure
it looks like I'm really reading it.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.115
Jess! Am I photo-friendly? How is it going?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.950
- Ari, we need to talk.
- Right.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.787
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
bump Patrick Whitesell off the list?

18:41.871 --> 18:43.121
'Cause I'm officially okay with that.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.625
Ari, what year did you graduate?

18:46.709 --> 18:48.794
1990.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.379
Not law school. Undergrad.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.217
What are you inferring?

18:55.301 --> 18:58.220
You're ineligible. Your birthday's Thursday.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.472
Right, Thursday I'm gonna be 36.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.516
Can you believe it? Time flies, huh?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.976
No, you're turning 40, Ari.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.187
I just got off the phone
with your old assistant

19:07.271 --> 19:10.273
Josh Weinstein. 40.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.275
Weinstein.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.904
Come on, guys, let's go.
Let's wrap it up. We're not staying.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.741
Someone's gonna pay
for the mystic tan, Jess?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.494
You're staying.
I'm gonna take some family photos.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.995
You guys work for me now.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.998
Yeah, Rufus, thanks for doing this so quick.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.834
It was nothing. I just repo'd all this shit

19:28.918 --> 19:30.544
out of Don Johnson's house anyway.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.170
The motherfucker tried to pay me

19:32.255 --> 19:34.172
with signed Nash Bridges DVDs.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.424
Season three, episode seven,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.927
me and Cheech, enjoy.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.888
All right, here we go.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.307
He's really outclassed here tonight.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.810
Now this place is a home.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.812
Six months tops, the salt water

19:48.896 --> 19:50.814
will chew a hole right through that screen.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.817
This kid's a fucking misery, huh?

19:53.901 --> 19:56.236
Hey, guys, how do I look?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.196
How do you look? You look like you.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.323
He's saying you look good, Vince.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.117
I don't love the shirt, personally.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.702
Rufus, you don't like the shirt?

20:03.786 --> 20:06.538
Vince, that shirt dulls
the sparkle in your eyes.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.541
If I was you, I'd go with blue Faรงonnable.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.878
It says, "Hello, I'm here,
and I'm doing fine without you. "

20:12.962 --> 20:14.588
Vince, you're kidding me, right?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.048
I know you 25 years,
you never asked me how you looked.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.550
You know you look fucking good.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.511
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just kidding.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.513
Could go for a smoke, though.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.181
I got a pound of the bubble kush stashed

20:25.266 --> 20:27.642
- in the wheel well of my DeVille.
- Roll one up.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.978
- Cool.
- I'm gonna change the shirt.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.482
Mandy Moore, kryptonite.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.288
Any big news stories today, E?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.873
What do you mean?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.125
Mandy's really smart.
She was always testing me

20:52.209 --> 20:53.877
on what was going on in the world.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.921
I heard Pamela Anderson
dropped another tit size.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.547
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Just tell her

20:57.632 --> 20:59.966
you're devastated by
what's going on in Africa.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.718
It says you're up on current events

21:01.802 --> 21:04.596
- and you're sensitive.
- Yeah.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.057
All right, I'm going in.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.976
All right. Go get her, Vince. Head up, baby.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.770
Yo, remember,

21:11.854 --> 21:14.147
the movie's called Aquaman, not Aquagirl.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.858
Go get her.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.955
- Vince, how are you?
- Hey, Charlie, how are you doing?

21:30.039 --> 21:31.748
Miss Moore's waiting at your table.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.920
All right. See you.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.715
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.217
- How are you?
- Hello.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.718
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.762
Good to see you too.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.151
Well, I guess we've proven
that this won't be awkward.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.537
Damn, I should have
told him about that busload of nuns

22:10.621 --> 22:12.372
that fell off that cliff last month.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.124
What he should have been talking about

22:14.208 --> 22:16.960
was all the girls he's banged
in the last five years.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.837
That would have drove her crazy.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.964
I can't believe I'm waiting outside a restaurant

22:21.048 --> 22:23.008
while he's on a date.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.468
How do you like being a manager now, E?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.513
I was.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.182
- That's not how I remember it.
- You have your memories,

22:31.267 --> 22:32.809
and I have mine.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.477
Let's try and cherish them both.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.146
Okay.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.565
Can you believe it's been five years?

22:38.649 --> 22:40.692
I know, time is flying, huh?

22:40.776 --> 22:43.403
And you don't think
it's strange we've never spoken?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.574
We had an on-set romance.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.284
These things don't last.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.578
Wow!

22:51.662 --> 22:53.413
Someone's gotten glib.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.458
Well, I've glibbened with age.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.834
What can I say?

23:00.421 --> 23:03.006
- I know that's not a word.
- I wasn't gonna correct you.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.299
- Really?
- Okay, I was,

23:04.383 --> 23:06.885
but I realized that you were kidding.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.015
Look, I don't know what to say.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.477
Why don't you tell me
why you never called me back?

23:16.479 --> 23:20.023
I mean, I was humiliated. What do you...

23:20.107 --> 23:22.108
You asked me to marry you after five weeks.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.402
- I was 20!
- I thought I was in love with you.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.071
I thought I was in love with you too.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.073
I just thought you were half-kidding.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.491
No, I wasn't.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.493
But look, this is fate, right?

23:31.577 --> 23:34.412
Every time I've ever done a movie,
I've always imagined them

23:34.497 --> 23:36.539
telling me that you were gonna be the girl.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.583
And you are the girl.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.752
You're single, I'm single.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.420
We'll take it slow, see what happens.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.172
No, no, no, I'm not single.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.634
I'm getting married in a month.

23:59.897 --> 24:03.191
- How'd it go?
- She was right. It's awkward.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.819
Let's get her off the movie.

24:06.305 --> 24:12.674
