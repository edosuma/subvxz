00:12.914 --> 00:15.750
- [Claire] Luke, stay with me.
- [groaning]

00:15.834 --> 00:18.837
Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe.

00:21.965 --> 00:24.593
Don't move. Okay? I've got you.

00:26.970 --> 00:29.097
[groaning loudly]

00:40.942 --> 00:42.569
[engine starting]

00:52.078 --> 00:53.830
[breathing heavily]

01:09.596 --> 01:11.139
Hey there, you.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.060
- [straining]
- Okay.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.646
Come on.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.397
Relax.

01:19.481 --> 01:21.024
[breathing heavily]

01:21.107 --> 01:22.191
Relax. You're okay.

01:23.234 --> 01:25.820
- Where am I?
- Uh, you're in an ambulance.

01:25.904 --> 01:27.822
You went into shock.

01:28.782 --> 01:29.824
I called my friend Manny.

01:29.908 --> 01:31.743
He used to run with my uncle
back in the day.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.161
He's driving. He's discreet.

01:33.244 --> 01:35.038
[groans] What the hell
did you do that for?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.498
- What do you mean?
- No hospitals.

01:37.582 --> 01:40.544
- I can't be in the system.
- He borrowed it.

01:41.294 --> 01:42.671
Like I said, he's discreet.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.173
But you bleeding out
in the back of a gypsy cab?

01:45.256 --> 01:47.133
That would get even more attention.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.637
We need to keep you safe. Drink this.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.889
You can't dehydrate.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.979
I saw you looking for the shooter
before you passed out.

02:00.897 --> 02:02.106
Did you see who it was?

02:02.816 --> 02:03.817
No.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.484
- [groans]
- On a scale from one to ten,

02:05.569 --> 02:06.986
how much pain are you in right now?

02:08.655 --> 02:09.989
[breathing heavily] Three.

02:10.865 --> 02:12.033
Liar.

02:12.701 --> 02:13.827
I'm okay.

02:14.953 --> 02:16.204
You're not okay.

02:17.288 --> 02:20.083
The bullet penetrated through your skin.
I didn't even think that could happen.

02:22.669 --> 02:24.045
That makes two of us.

02:26.422 --> 02:27.966
[breath trembling]

02:28.049 --> 02:30.426
- I looked for an exit wound, but...
- I know.

02:31.427 --> 02:32.721
It's still in there.

02:34.556 --> 02:38.059
The sound that it made,
like it was drilling into you...

02:39.686 --> 02:41.020
I wanna get a closer look.

02:41.938 --> 02:44.691
See what's going on inside of you.
I know a place.

02:47.318 --> 02:49.696
[Luke] Whatever we gotta do.

02:52.198 --> 02:53.825
[gunshot]

03:14.262 --> 03:16.765
[theme music playing]

04:26.625 --> 04:28.461
- [Luke] You okay?
- [Claire] Yeah.

04:28.544 --> 04:31.464
- [both groan]
- Manny?

04:31.547 --> 04:32.799
[Manny] Who was that son of a bitch?

04:32.882 --> 04:35.719
- [groans] Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

04:35.802 --> 04:37.345
But somebody took a shot at us.

04:37.428 --> 04:39.931
You guys got to get out of here. Go!

04:41.349 --> 04:42.600
[groans]

04:54.821 --> 04:55.905
[Claire] Watch out.

04:56.614 --> 04:58.032
[both grunting]

05:03.579 --> 05:06.249
Can you dig it?

05:07.666 --> 05:09.502
[Claire] What the hell?

05:11.379 --> 05:13.506
Every Friday night at the drive-in.

05:14.632 --> 05:16.342
<i>The Warriors.</i>

05:17.260 --> 05:22.056
[sing-song] Carl, come out and play.

05:24.017 --> 05:26.895
- You know him, don't you?
- [sirens wailing in distance]

05:31.565 --> 05:33.276
[man] I'm enjoying this shit, Carl.

05:33.359 --> 05:34.903
Keep running.

05:37.530 --> 05:39.157
[grunts]

05:39.240 --> 05:41.617
[Claire whispering] Luke, hey.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.494
You can't fight him yet, Luke.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.454
[panting]

05:45.538 --> 05:47.040
You're too weak right now.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.000
Come on.

06:02.555 --> 06:03.973
I didn't want it!

06:06.392 --> 06:08.519
[yells and breathes heavily]

06:10.271 --> 06:12.065
[Shades] You having second thoughts?

06:19.864 --> 06:21.657
[Shades sighs]

06:23.534 --> 06:25.203
What's on your mind?

06:27.663 --> 06:29.582
I'm not having any thoughts.

06:30.583 --> 06:31.750
Is that normal?

06:32.501 --> 06:34.921
As long as you stay on the clock,
it doesn't matter.

06:36.089 --> 06:41.635
<i>The secret to every great lie</i>
<i>is it has to run parallel to the truth.</i>

06:41.719 --> 06:45.598
Every moment wasted
brings you one step closer to jail.

06:46.765 --> 06:47.808
So what do we do?

06:48.893 --> 06:52.396
[Shades] <i>DNA is our friend...</i>
<i>and our enemy.</i>

06:52.480 --> 06:54.190
<i>We must treat her carefully.</i>

06:54.273 --> 06:57.068
Head straight to the bathroom
and clean up.

06:57.944 --> 06:59.070
I don't have any clothes.

06:59.153 --> 07:02.115
I had Alex take care of it.
They're in there.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.535
<i>- To make this stick, we'll need a patsy.</i>
- [camera shutter clicking]

07:11.875 --> 07:14.836
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

07:14.919 --> 07:16.420
Karma is a cruel mistress.

07:16.504 --> 07:20.008
She does not like being a side chick.
She eventually gets hers.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.135
- Brace yourself.
- It's that bad?

07:22.218 --> 07:23.261
Yeah.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.349
Did you forget anything?

07:29.183 --> 07:30.184
The bottle.

07:30.268 --> 07:31.560
[Mariah screams] No!

07:33.646 --> 07:35.481
I hit him on the head with a bottle.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.775
Did it break?

07:38.985 --> 07:41.404
- No.
- That's good.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.490
[Misty] Make sure we photograph the stage.

07:44.573 --> 07:47.285
Compare the photos
with the last performance filmed here.

07:47.368 --> 07:49.537
See if there's anything missing.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.498
Microphone stand, a monitor, anything.

07:52.581 --> 07:56.085
What do you think? You're the visualist.

08:02.175 --> 08:04.052
[Misty] <i>You see all that trauma</i>
<i>to the head and the face?</i>

08:04.135 --> 08:06.679
<i>The fall couldn't have done that.</i>
<i>It's not enough height.</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:09.848
[groans]

08:12.936 --> 08:14.853
[groaning]

08:16.689 --> 08:18.691
[Stokes breathing heavily]

08:18.774 --> 08:20.859
[Misty] <i>But he's not dead yet.</i>

08:24.530 --> 08:26.908
So let's say our perp did hit him
over and over again

08:26.991 --> 08:29.368
with a blunt instrument until he's dead.

08:29.452 --> 08:32.163
The trash bag is for the clothes
you're wearing.

08:32.246 --> 08:35.291
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

08:35.374 --> 08:37.501
Spurlock will incinerate them.

08:37.585 --> 08:42.340
The towels you use, the rugs...
They all go in that trash bag.

08:42.423 --> 08:46.635
Get dressed from the clothes
in the garment bag.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.097
I look like I'm in shock.

08:50.473 --> 08:53.517
Is that why you're speaking to me
as if I'm a child?

08:55.186 --> 08:56.812
I need you to hear me.

08:56.895 --> 08:59.023
I want you to win.

09:00.316 --> 09:01.817
Do what I say...

09:02.818 --> 09:04.320
and when you get away with this...

09:05.321 --> 09:08.282
you can go back to being the sexy...

09:09.242 --> 09:12.703
domineering bitch...
that we all hate to love.

09:13.871 --> 09:15.248
Now go.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.128
[sighs and sniffles]

09:28.511 --> 09:31.680
That's the last time
you will ever call me a bitch.

09:39.063 --> 09:40.939
Look at what you did.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.861
Destroying the face...

09:45.944 --> 09:48.031
[grunting]

09:48.114 --> 09:50.366
...that's rage.

09:51.993 --> 09:53.995
But walking away
without leaving a trail of blood?

09:54.078 --> 09:55.454
Who's ever done that?

09:55.538 --> 09:57.665
Temper, temper, Carl.

10:05.714 --> 10:08.092
[Misty] Councilwoman Dillard,
my condolences.

10:09.093 --> 10:10.803
Oh, please.

10:10.886 --> 10:14.807
My cousin's still laid out on the floor
and you're talking about condolences.

10:14.890 --> 10:16.517
What's the condolence? The sheet?

10:18.019 --> 10:19.812
I think you're taking this personally.

10:19.895 --> 10:21.105
Why aren't you?

10:25.193 --> 10:27.236
We are working as fast as we can.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.197
They said you called this in.

10:32.908 --> 10:36.620
Around noon, I called Cornell
and told him that we needed to talk.

10:37.746 --> 10:40.166
He said he was busy
and that he would get back to me.

10:40.249 --> 10:43.419
So I went in to work.
I mean, what could I do?

10:44.628 --> 10:47.756
Thanks to him,
I had a million fires to put out.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.261
Around 10:00,
I realized that I hadn't heard back so...

10:52.345 --> 10:54.055
[inhales]

10:54.138 --> 10:55.764
I decided to come here.

10:55.848 --> 10:59.227
"Thanks to him." So you were mad.

11:00.061 --> 11:04.273
Frustrated, yes. Mad? Never.

11:05.608 --> 11:10.613
He was my first cousin,
but I practically raised that boy.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.451
I loved him.

11:16.827 --> 11:19.372
So when you got here
was the door locked?

11:21.999 --> 11:26.044
There is a code on the VIP entrance.
It keeps the paparazzi away.

11:26.129 --> 11:27.463
It changes every week.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.007
Yes, I had access.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.468
So you let yourself in. Then what?

11:34.553 --> 11:38.599
Then I found him,
sprawled out like a goddamn rag doll.

11:38.682 --> 11:41.560
So he was already dead
when you got here.

11:44.147 --> 11:45.273
Yeah.

11:47.525 --> 11:49.943
But then I heard someone else crying.

11:50.819 --> 11:51.904
Who?

11:54.240 --> 11:55.991
Candace. [sobbing]

11:56.074 --> 11:58.661
[sniffles] Candace Miller.

11:58.744 --> 12:01.372
Candace is Cornell's VIP hostess.

12:02.456 --> 12:06.126
Candy's worked here at Harlem's Paradise
since we re-opened.

12:13.384 --> 12:16.804
Ms. Miller...
I'm Detective Misty Knight.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.139
What did you see?

12:20.057 --> 12:22.685
Take your time to collect your thoughts.

12:22.768 --> 12:25.938
I don't need time. I saw who did it.

12:26.021 --> 12:27.606
It was Luke Cage.

12:37.950 --> 12:40.077
[reporters clamoring]

12:42.455 --> 12:45.040
[reporter 1] Councilwoman!
[reporter 2] Right here! Over here!

12:46.124 --> 12:48.836
[reporter 3] Can you confirm that
it was Luke Cage who killed your cousin?

12:48.919 --> 12:50.463
Is Harlem's hero a cold-blooded murderer?

12:50.546 --> 12:51.839
Or did he just take out the trash?

12:51.922 --> 12:53.507
- [Mariah] Who said that?
- I did. Frank...

12:53.591 --> 12:58.053
My cousin Cornell Stokes
was a complex man.

12:58.136 --> 13:02.558
Conflicted, but underneath all the bluster
was the soul of a musician.

13:03.058 --> 13:06.061
<i>He was a true Harlem original.</i>

13:06.144 --> 13:09.106
[stammers] But what about this stranger?
That's the garbage.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.693
But in your media rush
to anoint a savior after the explosion

13:12.776 --> 13:17.114
at Genghis Connie's,
no one asked the crucial question.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.158
Who the hell is Luke Cage?

13:20.243 --> 13:23.621
You label Cornell Stokes
a gangster, a thug.

13:23.704 --> 13:27.583
<i>But as many people</i>
<i>recently witnessed at Mount Olivet,</i>

13:27.666 --> 13:31.420
<i>Cornell was a repentant man</i>
<i>dealing with his violent past.</i>

13:31.504 --> 13:33.339
<i>Making amends for his wrongs.</i>

13:33.422 --> 13:37.050
<i>He had every intention of...</i>
<i>of cooperating with the police.</i>

13:37.134 --> 13:39.928
Goddamn vigilantes
who call themselves heroes,

13:40.012 --> 13:43.599
like Luke Cage, they are dangerous.

13:43.682 --> 13:46.226
<i>They are a menace</i>
<i>to the safety, the security,</i>

13:46.310 --> 13:49.897
<i>and the sanctity of our community.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

13:49.980 --> 13:52.107
People have used a lot of words
to describe my cousin,

13:52.190 --> 13:55.068
but one word they have
never used is "coward."

13:55.152 --> 13:57.530
<i>And only a coward</i>
<i>would hide in the shadows</i>

13:57.613 --> 13:59.657
and kill an innocent man.
[stutters] That's it.

13:59.740 --> 14:00.741
[reporters clamoring]

14:00.824 --> 14:03.952
[reporter] One more question.
Councilwoman, was he innocent?

14:04.036 --> 14:05.538
[clamoring continues]

14:07.581 --> 14:08.707
[Luke breathing heavily]

14:08.791 --> 14:12.002
[Claire] That guy's putting
innocent people in danger to get at you.

14:14.713 --> 14:17.550
I'm gonna put a stop to it,
but I need your help.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.596
[groaning]

14:23.847 --> 14:25.433
[breathing heavily]

14:28.477 --> 14:31.397
Hold on to this. I can't lose it.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.731
[Claire] Okay.

14:36.026 --> 14:37.611
[groans]

14:42.408 --> 14:43.909
[Claire] I'm going to sterilize the area.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.666
[wincing]

14:50.749 --> 14:53.377
- You feel that?
- [groans] A bit.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.088
Keep going.

14:56.171 --> 14:58.424
No. I'm gonna see what kind
of anesthetic they have here first.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.468
- No drugs.
- Luke...

15:00.551 --> 15:02.511
I can't be compromised.

15:02.595 --> 15:05.473
Innocent people could die.
I can't risk it.

15:07.057 --> 15:08.892
All right, macho man.

15:10.018 --> 15:11.520
Actually, it's Power Man.

15:11.604 --> 15:14.231
That's what Pop used to call me.
[chuckles]

15:14.315 --> 15:17.025
- That's even cornier.
- [chuckling]

15:17.109 --> 15:18.151
[groans]

15:19.362 --> 15:20.446
Okay.

15:21.238 --> 15:23.699
- I'm going in.
- [groaning]

15:27.119 --> 15:29.788
All right,
I'm gonna press even harder, okay?

15:32.124 --> 15:34.001
[Luke groaning]

15:35.252 --> 15:37.338
[scalpel scraping]

15:38.171 --> 15:39.297
[Luke groans]

15:41.008 --> 15:42.676
Wild.

15:43.636 --> 15:44.762
This is supposed to be soft tissue,

15:44.845 --> 15:47.765
but it's almost
as impenetrable as your skin.

15:47.848 --> 15:49.307
Give it to me.

15:52.060 --> 15:54.355
[breathes deeply]

15:59.777 --> 16:01.069
[scraping]

16:01.153 --> 16:02.279
[Luke groaning]

16:04.239 --> 16:05.491
[exhales]

16:05.574 --> 16:07.200
[scraping]

16:07.284 --> 16:08.869
- [breathing heavily]
- [scalpel clanging]

16:09.870 --> 16:11.497
[grunts]

16:11.580 --> 16:12.873
I gotta get it out.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.626
It's getting hard to breathe.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.837
Okay, let's look inside.

16:28.681 --> 16:29.890
[door closes]

16:30.849 --> 16:32.726
[Misty] Anybody waiting for you at home?

16:32.810 --> 16:34.102
My parents.

16:34.186 --> 16:36.647
I'm moving out
as soon as I finish night school.

16:36.730 --> 16:37.731
Nice.

16:38.774 --> 16:42.194
The quicker you answer my questions,
the quicker you can go. Okay?

16:42.277 --> 16:43.404
Okay.

16:44.572 --> 16:46.699
State your name and address
for the record.

16:46.782 --> 16:49.242
Candace Miller. 555 Edgecombe Avenue.

16:49.326 --> 16:51.620
- How do you know Mr. Stokes?
- He was my boss.

16:51.704 --> 16:54.832
- I noticed your hair was wet.
- I took a shower.

16:54.915 --> 16:58.711
Crime scene officers combed
every inch of Harlem's Paradise.

16:58.794 --> 17:00.128
We also noticed that the shower

17:00.212 --> 17:02.548
in Mr. Stokes' private bathroom
had been used.

17:02.631 --> 17:04.508
- I used it.
- When?

17:05.509 --> 17:07.176
After I was saw Mr. Stokes.

17:08.011 --> 17:11.263
So, you're one of his... friends?

17:12.724 --> 17:13.892
Yes.

17:14.893 --> 17:16.520
He has several?

17:17.646 --> 17:20.733
So I assume you have his code
for his private entrance.

17:21.775 --> 17:22.943
What private entrance?

17:23.026 --> 17:24.569
[door opens]

17:24.653 --> 17:27.990
Don't say another word, Ms. Miller.
I'm representing you now.

17:28.073 --> 17:29.825
Is this snake your lawyer?

17:31.409 --> 17:34.412
Candace, if you're not guilty,
you'll answer my questions.

17:34.497 --> 17:36.874
Nice try. My client isn't under arrest.

17:36.957 --> 17:38.416
- Ms. Miller...
- I'm not guilty.

17:38.501 --> 17:39.752
What else do you want to know?

17:39.835 --> 17:41.336
Ms. Miller, don't say another word.

17:41.419 --> 17:44.965
We used luminol and found traces of blood
in Mr. Stokes' shower,

17:45.048 --> 17:47.510
even though it had been heavily bleached.

17:47.593 --> 17:48.594
Stand up and walk out.

17:48.677 --> 17:50.804
It's a good thing
you got this high-powered flunky.

17:50.888 --> 17:53.181
I'm about to nail your ass to the wall.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.850
It was Luke Cage!

17:57.352 --> 17:58.353
[sighs]

18:02.315 --> 18:05.277
After I showered,
I came out to see Cornell.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.571
I still needed my paycheck.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.492
I heard loud voices and a struggle.

18:11.575 --> 18:13.035
That's when I walked out

18:13.118 --> 18:15.913
and I saw Mr. Stokes
down below on the floor.

18:15.996 --> 18:17.372
[sighs]

18:18.791 --> 18:22.044
Luke Cage saw me and ran away.

18:23.128 --> 18:25.589
He was wearing bright yellow gloves,

18:25.673 --> 18:28.884
like the kind he used to use
when he washed dishes.

18:28.967 --> 18:32.304
And you're positive it was Luke Cage?

18:32.387 --> 18:34.306
You would know.

18:34.389 --> 18:36.975
I saw you two at the bar together
the other night.

18:37.059 --> 18:39.019
I saw you talking outside, too.

18:39.728 --> 18:40.938
May I go now?

18:42.064 --> 18:43.982
Candace, look me in the eye.

18:45.192 --> 18:49.947
You were too scared to go upstairs
and serve Cottonmouth without Luke.

18:50.030 --> 18:53.158
Table number seven, right?

18:53.241 --> 18:55.452
And then you started sleeping with him?

18:55.536 --> 18:58.706
But you still call him Mr. Stokes.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.874
And you can't even tell me
about his private entrance.

19:00.958 --> 19:05.295
What do they have on you, huh?
Is it money?

19:05.378 --> 19:06.672
How much are they paying you?

19:06.755 --> 19:09.341
This is over. We're done.

19:11.093 --> 19:13.345
Your delivery arrived right on time.

19:14.346 --> 19:16.056
Yes, thank you.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.392
Okay, gotta go.

19:20.561 --> 19:22.520
- [sighs]
- You killed it out there.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.858
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

19:25.941 --> 19:28.777
Just get that clip up
on the website within the hour.

19:28.861 --> 19:31.905
Send the link to all my supporters,
the donors.

19:31.989 --> 19:35.283
- If we play this right...
- [slow clapping]

19:36.368 --> 19:38.621
And the Oscar goes to...

19:38.704 --> 19:40.914
Alex, would you wait in the car with Tony?

19:46.294 --> 19:47.880
Detective, do you have a problem?

19:47.963 --> 19:49.798
Just call 'em like I see 'em.

19:49.882 --> 19:52.384
So you have your suspect, Luke Cage.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.262
Who says I only have one suspect?

19:55.345 --> 19:57.931
You ready for our interview?

19:58.015 --> 20:01.559
Your cousin was attacked
by somebody he was close to.

20:01.644 --> 20:03.729
That's what those wounds tell me.

20:03.812 --> 20:06.607
It was passion. And hatred.

20:06.690 --> 20:10.861
And Luke Cage didn't hate my cousin...
and me,

20:10.944 --> 20:14.531
when he showed up at my brownstone
trying to intimidate me?

20:14.615 --> 20:16.574
What do you have on Candace?

20:17.575 --> 20:19.369
What do you have on me?

20:21.622 --> 20:24.708
Other than the fact
that your edges are a little damp?

20:27.961 --> 20:30.798
That's what I thought.
You ain't got shit.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.633
You know what?

20:32.716 --> 20:36.386
I'm not under arrest,
and I changed my mind.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.264
You want to talk to me,
you call my lawyer.

20:40.641 --> 20:41.850
[sighs]

20:43.393 --> 20:45.062
Where's your partner?

20:45.145 --> 20:46.855
Oh, I forgot.

20:46.939 --> 20:48.523
- Sorry.
- Who the hell

20:48.606 --> 20:50.818
- do you think you're talking to?
- [Ridley] Detective.

20:51.777 --> 20:54.822
Priscilla, you need to teach
your people some manners.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.658
Mariah, I'm so sorry for your loss.

20:57.741 --> 20:59.910
- Thank you for being there for me.
- Of course.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.788
Oh. It has been a very hard day.

21:02.871 --> 21:05.332
- I'm sure.
- Hey.

21:05.415 --> 21:07.542
Are you gonna make it
to the Founders' Day Lunch at Cecil's?

21:07.625 --> 21:09.795
- You know I'll be there.
- Oh, great.

21:09.878 --> 21:11.629
[Mariah chuckles]

21:13.966 --> 21:15.342
[whispers] Bye-bye.

21:19.637 --> 21:20.723
You hugged her.

21:21.348 --> 21:24.101
She's my soror. I had to.

21:24.184 --> 21:25.853
You like Mariah for this?

21:25.936 --> 21:28.605
- I do.
- You have an eyewitness, Detective.

21:28.689 --> 21:32.109
- Who I can't trust.
- Who puts Luke Cage in the box.

21:32.192 --> 21:33.902
The evidence points to two suspects.

21:33.986 --> 21:36.154
One of them was someone
Cottonmouth was close to.

21:36.238 --> 21:37.781
Because the door was locked?

21:37.865 --> 21:40.408
Because they got to gangster number one
without catching a bullet.

21:40.492 --> 21:41.659
Come on!

21:42.577 --> 21:45.998
- Mariah called us.
- Then she called the press.

21:46.081 --> 21:48.625
And she put Luke Cage on blast.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.253
Look, I was just about to compel her
to make a statement

21:51.336 --> 21:54.339
before you let your little soror
skee-wee on out of here.

21:54.422 --> 21:55.841
Where is Cage?

21:56.424 --> 21:59.344
Because Mariah's not going anywhere,
guilty or not.

21:59.427 --> 22:02.222
But your real number-one suspect is ghost.

22:03.431 --> 22:05.350
What are you gonna do about it?

22:16.153 --> 22:17.863
- [Luke gasping]
- [Claire] Okay.

22:19.907 --> 22:21.699
[breathing heavily]

22:23.744 --> 22:25.954
[heart beating]

22:27.790 --> 22:29.166
[Luke] Is it a boy or a girl?

22:29.249 --> 22:30.667
[Claire chuckles]

22:30.750 --> 22:32.878
It's either twins or you need
to start doing some sit-ups.

22:32.961 --> 22:34.171
[chuckles]

22:34.254 --> 22:35.923
[groaning]

22:42.054 --> 22:43.555
What is it?

22:43.638 --> 22:46.892
There's no bullet. It's just shrapnel.

22:46.975 --> 22:49.019
Yeah, the bullet drilled into your skin
and exploded.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.729
All the pieces that are left
are just trapped.

22:52.815 --> 22:54.066
How much?

22:55.025 --> 22:56.902
A lot. And they're moving.

22:56.985 --> 22:58.778
We couldn't get the scalpel in.

22:58.862 --> 23:00.697
How you gonna take the bullet out?

23:01.698 --> 23:03.658
Remember when Jessica shot you?

23:04.784 --> 23:06.703
I've been trying to forget that. [sighs]

23:07.495 --> 23:09.747
[sighs] Well, I drained the fluid
in your skull

23:09.832 --> 23:11.416
by going behind your eye socket.

23:13.668 --> 23:15.087
I'll figure this out.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.214
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [sighs]

23:19.049 --> 23:20.425
Blocked ID.

23:21.509 --> 23:23.846
Whoever it is has called three times.

23:23.929 --> 23:25.305
- See who it is.
- [cell phone beeps]

23:25.388 --> 23:28.141
- Hello?
- Hello?

23:28.225 --> 23:30.602
This is Detective Misty Knight.
Who is this?

23:31.644 --> 23:34.397
Uh, Claire Temple. Um...

23:34.481 --> 23:37.484
We met the other night.
I'm the nurse with the van...

23:37.567 --> 23:39.862
and, uh... Scarfe.

23:41.029 --> 23:42.280
[Luke] <i>Misty.</i>

23:42.364 --> 23:43.740
I need you to come down to the station.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.284
We've already been through this.

23:46.368 --> 23:47.369
No.

23:48.578 --> 23:49.746
<i>Cottonmouth's dead.</i>

23:52.624 --> 23:54.251
He was killed earlier tonight.

23:54.334 --> 23:57.170
<i>I need you to come down</i>
<i>to answer some questions.</i>

23:57.254 --> 23:58.630
You think I did it?

23:58.713 --> 24:00.465
A witness puts you at the scene.

24:00.548 --> 24:03.301
- Oh, this has got to be a joke.
<i>- Claire, stay out of this.</i>

24:03.385 --> 24:05.345
He's been with me all night.

24:05.428 --> 24:06.721
<i>He hasn't killed anyone.</i>

24:06.804 --> 24:10.225
[Misty] Luke, listen,
I've got crime scene guys

24:10.308 --> 24:12.810
combing through the barber shop
and the apartment upstairs.

24:12.895 --> 24:15.105
<i>Just make it easier on yourself, okay?</i>

24:15.188 --> 24:18.275
Claire, hang up.
They're trying to trace the call.

24:18.358 --> 24:19.651
[phone beeps]

24:19.734 --> 24:22.112
Luke. Luke!

24:22.195 --> 24:25.365
They're close. I've got a target area.

24:25.448 --> 24:27.075
He's near the park.
Do you want to send a unit?

24:27.159 --> 24:28.701
No. What's in the area?

24:28.785 --> 24:30.954
Uh, a few shops, a women's clinic.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.418
- I know that look. You're about to...
- I'm bringing him in myself.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.753
I didn't finish my sentence, Misty.

24:38.836 --> 24:41.173
You're about to do something stupid.
Don't.

24:41.256 --> 24:43.758
Listen, don't tell the inspector.

24:43.841 --> 24:45.052
Don't tell anybody.

25:19.794 --> 25:21.754
[Shades] I thought you went back
down south, Sugar.

25:21.838 --> 25:24.757
Ain't nothing down there for me.
I'm back.

25:24.841 --> 25:26.801
What do you guys want?

25:26.884 --> 25:29.721
[Zip] Well, Cottonmouth's gone, so...

25:29.804 --> 25:31.264
Yeah.

25:31.348 --> 25:33.516
You guys did a real bang up job
protecting him.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.353
What are you talking about?
He sent us away.

25:36.436 --> 25:38.896
Anyhow, shit done changed.

25:38.981 --> 25:41.733
So we gonna need to
work out some type of...

25:41.816 --> 25:42.817
What?

25:44.111 --> 25:45.237
Severance?

25:51.409 --> 25:53.203
Y'all work for me now.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.955
- [Amos] What about the club?
- It belongs to Mariah.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.750
But I'm in charge.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.461
Do you understand?

26:05.382 --> 26:06.508
Good.

26:07.425 --> 26:08.843
And do me a favor.

26:10.887 --> 26:12.472
Buy some new clothes.

26:13.515 --> 26:14.766
Please.

26:14.849 --> 26:16.851
We're first class all the way.

26:19.562 --> 26:22.024
You ain't worried about Luke Cage?

26:22.107 --> 26:23.316
[sighs]

26:26.569 --> 26:27.737
Leave.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.249
[takes deep breath]

27:05.608 --> 27:06.818
[camera shutter clicks]

27:08.361 --> 27:10.113
[Luke breathing heavily]

27:17.454 --> 27:19.038
We gotta hurry.

27:19.122 --> 27:21.249
I just want to examine
your soft tissue cells,

27:21.333 --> 27:23.710
see if there's another way in
I haven't thought of yet.

27:23.793 --> 27:25.002
[Luke] Just make it quick.

27:25.087 --> 27:27.547
Holy shit.

27:29.006 --> 27:32.885
Your epithelial cells are simultaneously
super elastic and energy absorbent.

27:35.763 --> 27:38.433
The cells that line your organs

27:38.516 --> 27:40.143
are stuck together like Legos,
which is normal.

27:40.227 --> 27:43.480
But when I try to pull them apart,
they snap back together.

27:43.563 --> 27:45.315
What does it mean, for real?

27:45.398 --> 27:48.901
[sighs] Don't quote me on this
because I'm not 100% sure,

27:48.985 --> 27:51.654
but it looks like the thing that makes
you super strong is the same thing

27:51.738 --> 27:54.199
that's trapping the shrapnel
and forcing it in deeper.

27:54.282 --> 27:55.867
[Misty] Did I miss the party?

27:58.120 --> 27:59.746
Is that a gunshot wound?

27:59.829 --> 28:02.290
I thought bullets couldn't hurt you.

28:02.374 --> 28:03.791
Join the club.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.878
Luke, who shot you?

28:06.961 --> 28:08.963
I never saw him.

28:09.046 --> 28:12.259
We were walking in Mount Morris Park.
The shot came out of nowhere.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.428
Sniper. Medium range.

28:15.512 --> 28:17.680
I went with him in the ambulance,
but then the shooter attacked.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.850
- We barely got out.
- The ambulance that got flipped over?

28:22.185 --> 28:23.728
Well, then that's your alibi.

28:24.854 --> 28:27.274
- Alibi?
- [cell phone vibrates]

28:28.107 --> 28:29.108
Hello?

28:31.611 --> 28:32.779
Yeah.

28:35.448 --> 28:36.866
Okay.

28:39.035 --> 28:40.036
Okay.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.372
Thanks, Bailey.

28:47.252 --> 28:48.628
Luke Cage...

28:50.255 --> 28:53.425
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

28:54.301 --> 28:55.843
You're kidding me.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.100
Get down!

29:06.354 --> 29:08.022
[whirring]

29:09.357 --> 29:13.278
10-13. Harlem Women's Clinic.
10-13. Shots fired.

29:13.361 --> 29:16.739
- [dispatcher] <i>10-13 Harlem Women's Clinic.</i>
- [whirring continues]

29:16.823 --> 29:17.990
[explosion]

29:19.576 --> 29:20.577
[breathing heavily]

29:23.913 --> 29:26.249
[Claire] What the hell kind of bullet
does that?

29:29.544 --> 29:31.003
I got him!

29:40.012 --> 29:42.056
I'm gonna go check it out.

29:42.139 --> 29:43.516
Your backup isn't here yet.

29:43.600 --> 29:47.103
When we get through this,
I'm still arresting your ass.

29:51.608 --> 29:53.401
[groaning]

29:54.194 --> 29:55.487
You okay?

29:57.029 --> 29:58.656
Maybe she got him.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.287
[screaming]

30:04.371 --> 30:05.830
[man grunting]

30:10.293 --> 30:11.794
[both grunting]

30:16.549 --> 30:17.967
[grunts]

30:22.930 --> 30:24.266
- [grunting]
- [glass shattering]

30:28.478 --> 30:30.480
[gun clicking]

30:31.981 --> 30:34.317
[both grunting]

30:40.031 --> 30:41.824
[both groaning]

30:43.075 --> 30:44.327
[wheezing]

30:46.996 --> 30:48.122
[Misty yells]

30:48.205 --> 30:49.791
- [Luke] Misty!
- [Misty groans]

30:56.088 --> 30:57.173
[groans]

30:57.257 --> 30:59.759
- [gasps]
- Let's spend some time together.

31:01.135 --> 31:02.178
[groans]

31:03.763 --> 31:06.140
I see Carl's taste in women
hasn't changed.

31:06.223 --> 31:08.893
He likes frizzy hair and a tight frame.

31:08.976 --> 31:12.146
Carl? Who's Carl? You mean Luke?

31:12.229 --> 31:15.733
No, I mean Carl, Misty.

31:15.817 --> 31:18.570
"Your adversary, the devil...

31:19.529 --> 31:22.490
walks around like a roaring lion...

31:23.408 --> 31:26.202
seeking whom he may devour."

31:26.286 --> 31:27.579
First Peter...

31:28.538 --> 31:31.666
chapter five... verse eight.

31:32.750 --> 31:36.338
See... my daddy was a preacher.

31:38.089 --> 31:39.966
Oh, come on. Aren't you gonna beg?

31:41.426 --> 31:43.470
Not even a little bit?

31:45.137 --> 31:48.391
If you're going to shoot me, then do it.

31:49.767 --> 31:51.102
Hmm.

31:51.185 --> 31:54.230
[groaning] I have to go after him.

31:54.314 --> 31:56.232
Help me up. [grunting]

32:01.529 --> 32:03.072
This is my cross to bear.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.325
[breathing heavily]
No one else can do this.

32:05.408 --> 32:06.409
[coughs]

32:29.015 --> 32:30.224
[Luke in distance] Misty!

32:30.307 --> 32:32.852
[man] You're slowing me down, baby girl.

32:32.935 --> 32:35.772
Besides, Luke likes you.

32:35.855 --> 32:38.358
I'll hurt you later.

32:38.441 --> 32:40.985
- He'll suffer more that way.
- [grunts]

32:41.944 --> 32:43.738
[siren wailing in distance]

32:46.366 --> 32:47.992
[Luke] Stryker!

33:13.768 --> 33:15.352
[Claire] Oh, my God.

33:20.567 --> 33:21.609
Go.

33:21.693 --> 33:22.944
End this.

34:20.543 --> 34:21.878
[Luke] Stryker?

34:25.547 --> 34:27.174
Stryker!

34:32.304 --> 34:34.641
[Stryker] You left me to rot, Carl.

34:39.228 --> 34:41.063
We can work this out.

34:41.147 --> 34:43.940
[Stryker] Work what out? My life?

34:44.025 --> 34:46.902
My mother destroying herself?

34:48.612 --> 34:50.532
Being away for so long?

34:51.824 --> 34:52.992
Nah.

34:53.993 --> 34:56.788
There's nothing left to work out.

34:56.871 --> 35:00.124
"I did not come to bring peace...

35:01.333 --> 35:02.459
but a sword."

35:04.045 --> 35:08.758
Ain't that what the great
Reverend James Lucas used to scream at us?

35:08.841 --> 35:12.053
Preached peace and prosperity...

35:12.136 --> 35:15.347
every Sunday on the pulpit,

35:15.431 --> 35:18.267
but come Friday night on the sideline?

35:18.350 --> 35:21.688
Nothing but fire and brimstone.

35:21.771 --> 35:26.275
Guess he saved the sin
for Saturday night like everybody else.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.737
And everybody else caught hell but you.

35:29.821 --> 35:33.866
All the world's a stage
for the preacher's son...

35:33.950 --> 35:35.993
and I was a quarterback.

35:37.244 --> 35:39.664
And no matter how many passes I threw...

35:40.540 --> 35:43.626
he was all about running the ball.

35:44.293 --> 35:47.463
Because he wanted the game in your hands.

36:02.604 --> 36:04.146
Hello, Carl.

36:07.149 --> 36:08.484
Willis.

36:08.568 --> 36:10.695
I prefer Diamondback.

36:10.778 --> 36:12.196
Because you're a snake...

36:13.239 --> 36:15.074
just like Cottonmouth.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.328
I am a snake.

36:20.329 --> 36:23.625
I've shed my skin for something better.
Stronger.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.128
You left me to rot, Carl...

36:28.045 --> 36:29.672
in a gutter.

36:29.756 --> 36:34.093
But I changed that sewer into a garden.

36:34.176 --> 36:35.762
I wasn't a good friend.

36:36.888 --> 36:38.723
I should've stood tall...

36:41.768 --> 36:43.227
but I didn't.

36:44.311 --> 36:45.605
And you paid the price.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.242
I've been watching you.

36:59.410 --> 37:02.997
Harlem doesn't realize
they're worshiping a false idol.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.166
- False idol?
- You, Carl. You.

37:05.249 --> 37:07.168
You're the golden calf.

37:07.251 --> 37:09.879
But I got commandments for your ass.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.256
I'm gonna bring the pain.

37:12.339 --> 37:13.800
Reva's death?

37:13.883 --> 37:15.301
Keep her name out of your mouth!

37:15.384 --> 37:17.053
The crimes you went to jail for?

37:17.136 --> 37:19.513
The torture you endured
once you were inside?

37:19.596 --> 37:21.724
All me, I'm afraid.

37:21.808 --> 37:23.643
Well, not Reva's death.

37:23.726 --> 37:26.854
I just like saying her name
just to watch you squirm.

37:27.730 --> 37:30.900
- You ruined my life.
- I gave you wings.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.194
[voice breaking] I sent you to hell...

37:34.153 --> 37:36.989
and you come back with superpowers.

37:38.658 --> 37:41.577
[inhales deeply] Ain't that a bitch?

37:41.661 --> 37:43.370
- [yelling]
- [gunshots]

37:46.958 --> 37:49.043
[Stryker yelling]

38:03.182 --> 38:04.225
[groans]

38:04.308 --> 38:05.768
[grunts]

38:14.026 --> 38:15.444
[both grunting]

38:28.958 --> 38:30.084
[exhales]

38:32.294 --> 38:33.420
[Stryker yelling]

38:40.552 --> 38:42.263
[both panting]

38:49.812 --> 38:51.188
[both grunting]

39:11.751 --> 39:13.961
- [coughing]
- [straining]

39:16.297 --> 39:17.298
[spits]

39:17.381 --> 39:19.341
You're bleeding, Carl.

39:20.968 --> 39:22.136
[grunts]

39:26.766 --> 39:27.934
[clattering]

39:31.728 --> 39:33.272
[Stryker yelling]

39:36.067 --> 39:37.193
[grunting]

39:38.485 --> 39:40.071
[gags]

39:56.337 --> 39:59.173
- Cooper went at her for about an hour.
- What did she say?

39:59.256 --> 40:01.217
[Ridley] Not much of anything.
Nothing we need

40:01.300 --> 40:03.177
in terms of finding Cage
or your attacker.

40:03.260 --> 40:04.636
I got it from here.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.807
- You're in no shape to talk to her.
- I'm fine!

40:07.890 --> 40:09.016
Are you?

40:10.142 --> 40:12.728
She'll talk to me, I promise.

40:12.812 --> 40:14.355
We have rapport.

40:23.614 --> 40:24.907
[sighs]

40:27.243 --> 40:29.703
The attacker. Who was he?

40:29.786 --> 40:32.206
[sighs] I already told the other guy
I don't know.

40:33.749 --> 40:36.878
You know, I helped you.
I helped your partner. Luke helped you.

40:36.961 --> 40:39.463
- Why are you...
- Mmm-mmm. No, no, no.

40:39.546 --> 40:42.299
The shooter, when he attacked,
what did he say?

40:42.383 --> 40:44.551
What's his connection to Luke?
Did Luke say?

40:44.635 --> 40:47.804
[sighs] You know, it's a blur.

40:47.889 --> 40:49.473
Who's Carl?

40:50.807 --> 40:53.269
Look, it is critical that I find Luke.

40:53.352 --> 40:55.312
So why aren't you outside
looking for him?

40:55.396 --> 40:57.106
Why won't you help me find him?

40:57.189 --> 40:59.066
- I want a lawyer.
- Why?

40:59.150 --> 41:00.776
You're not under arrest.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.736
But I can do that. I can arrest you.

41:02.819 --> 41:04.488
For what?

41:04.571 --> 41:06.282
Cottonmouth's dead
and you gave Luke an alibi.

41:06.365 --> 41:08.492
That's accessory to murder.
That's hard time.

41:08.575 --> 41:12.288
I'm not scared of you.
I did nothing wrong.

41:12.371 --> 41:16.125
That son of a bitch
is out there hurting people.

41:16.208 --> 41:20.379
But you won't do anything
to bring Luke Cage in and end this.

41:20.462 --> 41:22.089
I'm out of here.

41:22.173 --> 41:23.715
Sit your ass down!

41:25.009 --> 41:28.220
Now, people have been
walking out on me all day.

41:28.304 --> 41:31.432
No more lies and no more deception.

41:31.515 --> 41:34.810
You are going to tell me what happened
and where I can find Luke.

41:35.394 --> 41:36.979
Back off.

41:37.063 --> 41:38.480
What, you think just because
you got jumped

41:38.564 --> 41:39.815
by a psycho and lost your gun,

41:39.899 --> 41:41.192
you get to talk to me like that?

41:41.275 --> 41:43.444
- Do your job.
- What do you know about the job?

41:43.527 --> 41:45.404
You're either too weak
to stand up to pressure,

41:45.487 --> 41:47.364
or too stupid to see
that Luke is innocent.

41:47.448 --> 41:50.076
You probably couldn't find
your own ass with both hands.

41:53.329 --> 41:55.831
Who's weak now, huh? Huh?

41:55.915 --> 41:57.374
[door opens]

41:57.458 --> 41:58.459
[Claire grunts]

42:00.169 --> 42:01.878
Detective Knight.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.758
I apologize for how
you've been treated, Ms. Temple.

42:06.842 --> 42:09.011
Would you like to press charges
against Detective Knight?

42:09.095 --> 42:11.763
[Claire scoffs] Please.

42:13.265 --> 42:15.142
Luke Cage is innocent, Misty.

42:16.185 --> 42:18.020
You're after the wrong man.

42:18.104 --> 42:21.357
That's my statement. Write it down.

42:22.441 --> 42:24.401
Look, Inspector, I, um...

42:31.200 --> 42:33.077
[breathing heavily]

42:33.160 --> 42:34.411
Willis!

43:00.354 --> 43:02.856
You done good, baby girl.

43:02.939 --> 43:04.984
I know you were uncomfortable.

43:06.443 --> 43:08.362
I didn't like your cousin,

43:08.445 --> 43:10.156
and I would never sleep with him.

43:13.117 --> 43:15.244
But now I'm on record with that.

43:16.495 --> 43:18.247
I'm not a whore.

43:18.330 --> 43:19.748
No, you're not a whore.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.834
You're a businesswoman.

43:23.585 --> 43:27.923
And that, in your lap,
represents a chance to change your life...

43:29.800 --> 43:32.011
and that of your whole family.

43:33.179 --> 43:34.638
That's power.

43:39.018 --> 43:41.062
Did Luke really do all of that?

43:43.772 --> 43:46.900
You never really know
what anyone is capable of.

43:49.070 --> 43:52.531
[sighs] Go on, get some rest.

43:52.614 --> 43:56.035
You'll come back to the club
in a few days when it opens.

44:10.341 --> 44:11.383
[Shades] You think it worked?

44:12.593 --> 44:15.721
She's a good girl. She won't fold.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.182
What if she does?

44:20.434 --> 44:21.810
We'll have to kill her.

44:22.853 --> 44:25.021
And everybody else in that apartment.

44:25.106 --> 44:26.940
Make it look like a home invasion...

44:27.858 --> 44:29.693
which would be a damn shame.

44:30.777 --> 44:33.114
You know, Duke Ellington
used to live in that building.

44:33.197 --> 44:34.990
And Count Basie, too.

44:36.032 --> 44:39.161
I'd hate to bring down the market value.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.664
[Shades] That's my girl.

44:54.260 --> 44:55.677
[sighs]

45:04.728 --> 45:06.605
I'm not like you.

45:23.372 --> 45:24.706
[Stryker] Carl!

45:36.593 --> 45:39.471
They call this bullet the Judas.

45:41.598 --> 45:44.310
You barely survived the first blast.

45:45.311 --> 45:48.021
You won't survive the second.

45:52.193 --> 45:54.110
Any last words?

45:54.861 --> 45:56.154
Willis...

45:57.323 --> 45:59.157
I'm sorry.

46:01.285 --> 46:03.119
You don't have to do this.

46:04.455 --> 46:06.207
I loved you like a brother.

46:07.666 --> 46:09.125
Nigga...

46:09.210 --> 46:11.920
I am your brother.

46:17.384 --> 46:19.010
