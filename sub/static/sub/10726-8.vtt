00:00.426 --> 00:02.308
Coming out at
a Catholic High school

00:02.309 --> 00:03.512
was pretty scary,

00:03.513 --> 00:06.179
but my school wanted
me to feel more at home,

00:06.180 --> 00:08.179
so they put together a
gay straight alliance,

00:08.180 --> 00:10.109
which is, honestly, kind of great

00:10.110 --> 00:12.059
because I've been
wanting to find a place

00:12.060 --> 00:14.999
where I can hang out with
other kids like me.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.049
- He's here!
- He's queer!

00:16.050 --> 00:17.129
Get used to it!

00:17.130 --> 00:19.219
I was supposed to say that.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.567
Is this... is this
all... this is all of us?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.149
Am I the only "G" in the GSA?

00:23.150 --> 00:25.169
So far. Tell us everything.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.219
When you're hooking
up, what's second base?

00:27.220 --> 00:29.069
'Cause for us, it's boobs.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.049
What's the gay version of boobs?

00:31.050 --> 00:33.009
Um, excuse me... For a second.

00:33.010 --> 00:34.169
I think I forgot my gay wallet.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.099
I told you they had those!

00:36.100 --> 00:37.189
How did you know that?

00:37.190 --> 00:39.039
My mom says I have gay intuition.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.110
Oh, my god!

00:43.140 --> 00:47.029
While I've been trying
to find people like me...

00:47.030 --> 00:48.999
Ever since her divorce news broke,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.069
my mom's been trying to
avoid people like her.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.109
Eileen!

00:52.110 --> 00:53.999
I heard about you and pat...

00:54.000 --> 00:56.149
Sorry, Nancy. Ice
cream, can't talk. Bye!

00:56.150 --> 00:58.099
Eileen!

00:58.100 --> 01:00.029
- How are you?
- Sorry, Suzie.

01:00.030 --> 01:02.030
Paper towels, can't talk. Bye!

01:06.230 --> 01:08.229
- Eileen?
- Hey, Marcia.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.229
Can't talk. Bye!

01:14.170 --> 01:17.049
Can we please stop
shopping at the German market?

01:17.050 --> 01:18.179
I mean, what is this stuff?

01:18.180 --> 01:20.209
It's bundnerfleisch.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.674
It's air-dried meat cured with

01:21.699 --> 01:23.089
white wine and seasonings.

01:23.090 --> 01:24.209
Nope.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.080
I'm getting all meat and no

01:26.105 --> 01:27.343
- wine off this thing.
- Ugh.

01:27.494 --> 01:29.159
When are you going back to
the regular grocery store?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.029
When those gossiping hens

01:31.030 --> 01:33.069
stop staking me out in the parking lot.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.169
Oh, I would so love a
rotisserie hen right now.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.209
- Mmm.
- Hey!

01:36.210 --> 01:37.199
Hi.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.109
Hi.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.119
Hello.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.149
I'm here.

01:41.150 --> 01:43.079
- Yes, we see that.
- Oh, no.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.209
Aunt Jodi's having another
one of her Ambien blackouts.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.029
- Hmm.
- Jodi, you're awake!

01:47.030 --> 01:48.039
- You're awake!
- Aunt Jodi!

01:48.040 --> 01:49.159
- Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
- You're awake!

01:49.160 --> 01:51.999
- You're awake!
- No. I'm here for book club.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.069
Oh, my gosh. That's today?

01:55.070 --> 01:57.189
Um, no. No, we have to cancel.

01:57.190 --> 01:59.029
I can't face those women.

01:59.030 --> 02:00.189
It's too late. They'll
be here in 30 minutes.

02:00.190 --> 02:02.119
I can't be ready by then!

02:02.120 --> 02:04.109
I won't even be done chewing by then.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.179
I-it takes 8 to 10 days

02:05.180 --> 02:07.199
to get ready for a book-club meeting.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.098
I have to clean the
house, find all the right snacks...

02:10.100 --> 02:12.159
cold apps, hot apps, palate cleansers...

02:12.160 --> 02:15.169
all wrapped up in a
clever literary theme.

02:15.170 --> 02:17.159
Oh, well, maybe today's
theme could be "Panic and Shame."

02:17.160 --> 02:19.139
I have been avoiding these women,

02:19.140 --> 02:21.169
trying not to talk about my problems,

02:21.170 --> 02:23.159
but now these women are
coming into my home.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.059
How am I gonna not
talk about my problems

02:25.060 --> 02:26.119
when my problem's sitting right here?

02:26.120 --> 02:27.149
Well, if you'd like, we could...

02:27.150 --> 02:28.219
Yes, please. Don't be here.

02:28.220 --> 02:31.099
I was gonna say, "Help
Clean Up," but message received.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.119
You know, it's her
subtlety that I appreciate.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.059
- Can we leave, too?
- No!

02:35.060 --> 02:35.940
You and Shannon have to stay

02:35.965 --> 02:37.039
here and help me with book club.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.030
Of all times not to be
gay or divorcing you.

02:40.220 --> 02:42.069
Hey, Dad, so, I was thinking,

02:42.070 --> 02:44.169
since we have the day... I am so sorry.

02:44.170 --> 02:47.119
Are you alphabetizing three DVDs?

02:47.120 --> 02:50.049
Yeah, okay. So, I've got
"Evita," "Black Hawk Down,"

02:50.050 --> 02:51.229
and "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"

02:51.230 --> 02:53.059
but I can't decide if I want them

02:53.060 --> 02:54.189
in ascending or descending order.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.109
Actually, "Evita's" mine, but keep it.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.109
I've got the Blu-Ray.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.229
So, you know how,

02:58.230 --> 03:00.209
whenever Mom wants us out of the house,

03:00.210 --> 03:03.009
we always go to
Clifford's and we watch NASCAR?

03:03.010 --> 03:04.079
Yeah. You want to go early?

03:05.160 --> 03:07.039
Actually, uh, I was thinking

03:07.040 --> 03:08.999
maybe we don't watch NASCAR, like, ever,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.999
and by "we," I mean the human race.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.069
Oh, I get it. I see what's happening.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.079
Now that you're out,

03:13.080 --> 03:14.129
you don't want to do any of the things

03:14.130 --> 03:15.229
that you pretended to like before.

03:15.230 --> 03:18.009
Uh-huh, like I stopped
flossing post-divorce.

03:18.010 --> 03:20.199
Sure, except mine is a
reasonable... Decision.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.999
Anyway, uh, it's just that lately,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.999
I've been feeling like everywhere I go,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.209
I am the only gay person.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.059
Hmm. We can go to
Albert's and watch monster trucks.

03:30.060 --> 03:32.179
Yeah, no, you are driving the
wrong way down the street.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.329
Oh, I got it.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.747
There's a coffee shop that I pass

03:34.772 --> 03:36.039
sometimes when I'm on patrol,

03:36.040 --> 03:37.199
and it's not advertised as such,

03:37.200 --> 03:40.129
but I think they may be
known in some underground circles

03:40.130 --> 03:41.199
as a gay coffee shop.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.109
Do you mean the rainbow grind?

03:43.110 --> 03:46.009
- That's the one.
- That is, like, the gay coffee shop!

03:46.010 --> 03:47.229
I've been wanting to
go there for a while.

03:47.230 --> 03:50.049
You'd... Really take me?

03:50.050 --> 03:52.059
Of course I would.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.209
Now, should I
change, or should we match?

03:53.210 --> 03:55.079
Nah, maybe we shouldn't
match, but it'd be fun to match.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.189
I kind of love what I'm wearing, though.

03:56.190 --> 03:58.079
Dad, have you never hung
out with me before?

03:58.080 --> 03:58.999
I'm sorry, son.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.159
I'm just super excited

04:00.160 --> 04:03.139
that a straight dad and
a gay son can still bond...

04:03.140 --> 04:05.069
not that I was worried
before because I was excited,

04:05.070 --> 04:06.129
but now I'm excited even more.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.100
We should go.

04:11.060 --> 04:14.069
Now, look  this
isn't gonna be easy,

04:14.070 --> 04:15.189
but the goal is to get through today

04:15.190 --> 04:16.228
without having to dredge up

04:16.230 --> 04:18.129
a lot of our personal family business.

04:18.130 --> 04:19.108
I don't know, Mom.

04:19.110 --> 04:20.178
T-these women are your friends.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.168
These women are not my friends.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.219
They're my book club,

04:22.220 --> 04:25.129
and I purposely chose tough,
opinionated women

04:25.130 --> 04:27.209
who could see
through a flimsy narrative.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.189
Maybe you'd feel better if
you talk about some of this stuff,

04:29.190 --> 04:31.039
have a good cry.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.209
There's no crying in book club,

04:32.210 --> 04:34.209
not even when we read "The
Fault in Our Stars."

04:34.210 --> 04:36.999
Don't
even get me started on Augustus.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.119
He...

04:38.120 --> 04:39.229
Do you see this?

04:39.230 --> 04:42.109
Do you see how he's
being weak and vulnerable?

04:42.110 --> 04:43.055
There is no way I'm gonna act

04:43.080 --> 04:44.229
this way in front of those women,

04:44.230 --> 04:47.089
especially not Marcia Worthman.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.039
You know she's ready to pounce.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.179
So, you'll just stick to the book.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.129
Which I haven't even read.

04:52.130 --> 04:54.179
Luckily, I've read Hillary
Clinton's "Hard Choices"

04:54.180 --> 04:56.109
several times,

04:56.110 --> 04:57.801
and I made a cheat sheet of provocative

04:57.826 --> 04:59.069
questions and talking points

04:59.070 --> 05:01.029
to help stimulate the discussion.

05:01.030 --> 05:04.099
And I made the furniture into a circle,

05:04.100 --> 05:07.079
which is a square without
it's arms and legs.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.149
Okay, honey.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.796
Good work... both of you.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.059
- Ta-da!
- Oh, good.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.059
How did we do with the snacks?

05:14.060 --> 05:15.179
Did you come up with a theme?

05:15.180 --> 05:17.099
All I could find were
Swedish fish, goldfish,

05:17.100 --> 05:18.139
and fish sticks.

05:18.140 --> 05:20.089
What does that have to do with the book?

05:20.090 --> 05:23.129
She's a big female
fish in a small male pond.

05:23.130 --> 05:25.199
Right. Of course.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.069
So, now, if any one of the ladies

05:27.070 --> 05:28.209
tries to steer the conversation

05:28.210 --> 05:30.149
back toward our recent family problems,

05:30.150 --> 05:32.179
Shannon's gonna shout something
out about the book,

05:32.180 --> 05:34.149
Jimmy will stuff their face with food,

05:34.150 --> 05:36.189
and, if it comes to
that, Jodi can... Over-share

05:36.190 --> 05:39.039
about her... Very colorful life.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.029
I don't know if I can do that.

05:40.030 --> 05:41.169
It's been a really difficult week.

05:41.170 --> 05:44.009
My ex-boyfriend just told
me that he's still alive.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.129
Well, that... that could work.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.999
All right. Here we are.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.169
Ready for your first gay coffee shop?

05:54.170 --> 05:56.030
I was born ready.

05:57.230 --> 06:00.099
In this case, literally.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.059
I'm not ready.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.229
I mean, this is my first
time in the gay part of town.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.099
What if they judge me? Am
I wearing the right outfit?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.019
Should I have hit the gym before?

06:09.020 --> 06:10.179
Is there a gym inside the coffee shop?

06:12.000 --> 06:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:25.100 --> 06:27.229
Um... Hello?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.109
Come on!

06:35.110 --> 06:38.069
I know I'm hotter than a 3.14159!

06:38.070 --> 06:40.099
Huh.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.189
One medium soy latte for Robert.

06:41.190 --> 06:43.050
There you go.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.159
This is it?

06:46.160 --> 06:49.059
There's not even any
wordplay on the menu.

06:49.060 --> 06:52.019
Oh, I picked the wrong place, didn't I?

06:52.020 --> 06:55.009
This is what I have always wanted...

06:55.010 --> 06:58.019
a place where I'm not the odd man out.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.109
No. This is perfect.

07:00.110 --> 07:01.169
It is?

07:01.170 --> 07:02.229
So I did good?

07:02.230 --> 07:05.040
Yeah. You did great.

07:09.110 --> 07:11.229
I mean, seriously, no "chai me a river"?

07:11.230 --> 07:14.049
- It's right there!
- Shh-shh, shh-shh, shh-shh.

07:14.050 --> 07:16.079
Mrs. Worthman, more fish?

07:16.080 --> 07:17.119
You know, isn't it funny

07:17.120 --> 07:18.999
how the two that aren't fish

07:19.000 --> 07:20.089
look more like fish

07:20.090 --> 07:22.220
than the one that actually is fish?

07:25.010 --> 07:28.119
Eileen, I think I speak
for the group when I say,

07:28.120 --> 07:30.209
it is incredibly brave of
you to have us here today.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.069
Oh, Marcia.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.209
Mom, remember how you were telling me

07:33.210 --> 07:35.189
your favorite chapter in "Hard Choices"

07:35.190 --> 07:38.149
was about Hillary's
disagreement with the Saudi foreign minister

07:38.150 --> 07:41.119
over arming moderate
elements of the Syrian opposition?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.179
Well, Shannon,

07:42.180 --> 07:44.109
I think that's a very simplistic
way of putting it.

07:44.110 --> 07:46.179
But we should discuss it.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.999
I thought your favorite
chapter would be "A Fresh Start,"

07:49.000 --> 07:50.059
you know, considering a fresh start

07:50.060 --> 07:51.179
might be something you want.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.189
Right.

07:52.190 --> 07:54.099
Speaking of fresh starts,

07:54.100 --> 07:57.089
I'm considering filing for bankruptcy.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.049
What was your feeling
about the book overall, Eileen?

08:00.050 --> 08:02.059
You know, I just...

08:02.060 --> 08:03.159
Just all those hard choices.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.129
I kept thinking there
might be some easy ones,

08:05.130 --> 08:07.089
but, no, they were all hard.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.999
A choice comes along,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.009
and you think, "well, this
one's gonna be a snap."

08:11.010 --> 08:13.039
But, no, you know?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.009
So... It's another toughie.

08:15.010 --> 08:17.059
We've been through 14 books together.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.089
You don't have to pretend for us.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.119
Oh.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.029
I started a wildfire in a national park!

08:24.030 --> 08:25.159
Jodi, I've got this. Fine.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.199
I can see we're not gonna
be able to move on

08:27.200 --> 08:28.199
until you've heard it from me,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.229
so, yes, my son is gay

08:30.230 --> 08:33.179
and I'm getting a divorce

08:33.179 --> 08:35.198
and my husband lives in the basement.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.058
And, yes, I have been
avoiding you all at the grocery store,

08:39.059 --> 08:40.999
which is why there's paper
towels in the bathroom

08:41.000 --> 08:42.208
instead of toilet paper.

08:42.210 --> 08:45.079
Perfect Eileen is flawed.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.089
And my life is in chaos.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.110
Which is why I have not read this book.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.130
Hmm.

08:57.150 --> 08:59.030
I didn't read the book.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.089
I didn't read the book, either.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.169
If I'm being honest, I-I've
never read a book.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.019
Wow.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.019
I guess I'm not the only one.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.109
We're all in the same boat, Eileen.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.149
Thank you for making it okay to share.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.089
Can we all please get back to the book?

09:13.090 --> 09:14.103
You know, Marcia, I think we've

09:14.128 --> 09:15.149
talked enough about the book.

09:15.150 --> 09:18.209
I'd like to hear more
about Fran's adult illiteracy.

09:18.210 --> 09:21.129
I've never been around this
many gay people in one place...

09:21.130 --> 09:25.029
27, not counting the baby
because we don't know yet.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.199
Feels good to just blend in.

09:28.230 --> 09:32.119
Ahh. This place is fun, huh?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.159
And, look, there's fathers
and sons all over the place.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.209
- Oh, no, Dad, those aren't...
- Oop, now I see it.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.129
Um...

09:38.130 --> 09:41.019
But those guys are
playing "Settlers of Catan."

09:41.020 --> 09:42.209
They're about my age.

09:42.210 --> 09:43.160
I was gonna go over there

09:43.185 --> 09:44.149
- and talk to them.
- Yeah!

09:44.150 --> 09:46.169
Do you think you... you could...

09:46.170 --> 09:48.079
Oh, I get it.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.009
I get it. Cramping your style.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.109
I understand.

09:52.110 --> 09:53.999
I'm just gonna pay for this
"Tegan and Sara" CD,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.200
and I'll be out of here, okay?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.999
Pat O'Neal, what are you doing here?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.049
Hey, Zack! What's up?

09:59.050 --> 10:01.139
- Man, what's going on?
- Not much.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.484
Oh, I haven't seen you since

10:02.509 --> 10:04.019
- you transferred, right?
- Yeah.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.139
Gosh. How's Christie?

10:05.140 --> 10:07.179
Oh, um, maybe you haven't heard.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.209
Uh, I came out,

10:08.210 --> 10:12.169
so Christie is, uh,
mad and, uh, divorcing me.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.179
Well, that's a... that's
a bit of a curveball, Zack,

10:14.180 --> 10:16.019
and I'm gonna throw
one right back at ya.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.099
I'm getting a divorce, too.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.229
Uh, and my, uh... my boy, Kenny,

10:19.230 --> 10:21.109
recently came out, as well.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.029
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.079
So, I knew about this coffee shop.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.019
We thought we'd swing
by and check it out.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.219
Well, this place is pretty
much the heart of the gayborhood.

10:27.220 --> 10:31.019
Hey! Now there's the
wordplay this place is missing.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.049
What else should we be doing?

10:32.050 --> 10:33.059
Oh, lots.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.139
We got, uh... we got gay karaoke.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.169
We got gay yoga.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.219
We got gay Vegas,

10:37.220 --> 10:39.159
but you have to go to Vegas for that.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.119
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.999
Uh, do you have anything
else going on today?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.039
Well, actually, a group of us

10:44.040 --> 10:45.229
are going over to play gay dodgeball.

10:45.230 --> 10:48.009
Yeah, it's probably the
most fun all week.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.119
I mean, you should join. It's all ages.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.139
Yeah, that actually sounds amazing.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.209
Uh...

10:52.210 --> 10:54.009
Is it cool with you, Dad?

10:54.010 --> 10:55.159
I don't see why not?

10:55.160 --> 10:57.049
I can't believe it.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.179
This is what I've always dreamed of...

10:58.180 --> 11:00.029
hanging out in boystown

11:00.030 --> 11:01.229
with my own group of gay friends.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.169
Let's dodge some balls.

11:03.170 --> 11:06.030
And my dad?

11:07.525 --> 11:11.342
I mean, I guess, deep down, I
knew that pat and my problems

11:11.343 --> 11:13.628
couldn't be resolved after
our first therapy session.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.648
I would pay anyone
anything to listen to my problems.

11:16.649 --> 11:18.668
Only therapy I've tried is aromatherapy.

11:18.669 --> 11:20.668
Even that felt like defeat.

11:20.669 --> 11:23.438
Eileen, who's your therapist?

11:23.439 --> 11:24.628
Larry and I are on the outs, too.

11:24.629 --> 11:26.668
I'll get his card.

11:26.669 --> 11:31.448
I'm actually a licensed
therapist in Japan.

11:31.449 --> 11:33.538
I did not see this going this way.

11:33.539 --> 11:35.578
I thought all those
women would be against me,

11:35.579 --> 11:38.508
but now that I've opened
up, they're all on my side.

11:38.509 --> 11:40.618
It's like after Hillary lost
the Iowa caucus in '08.

11:40.619 --> 11:42.508
Then she cried,

11:42.509 --> 11:44.458
and everyone rallied
around her in New Hampshire.

11:44.459 --> 11:46.458
You have made yourself relatable.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.498
Whatever's happened,
the women are sharing.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.618
And Nancy spent her
son's entire college fund

11:50.619 --> 11:53.498
on draftkings... all $40 of it.

11:53.499 --> 11:55.528
Maybe I am this kind of person

11:55.529 --> 11:58.488
who opens up and talks
about their feelings.

11:58.489 --> 12:00.608
Maybe I can be their...

12:00.609 --> 12:02.550
What's the word?

12:02.551 --> 12:04.458
- "Friend"?
- That's it!

12:04.459 --> 12:05.638
Huh.

12:05.639 --> 12:08.508
Hmm... Tall guy, let's go.

12:08.509 --> 12:09.519
Yeah!

12:10.579 --> 12:12.628
Okay, next, I take Dr. Filbert

12:12.629 --> 12:15.548
because I owe him $3,000
in medical bills.

12:15.549 --> 12:16.658
Hey.

12:16.659 --> 12:19.568
Thanks again for the
shorts, Dr. Filbert!

12:19.569 --> 12:21.458
Hmm...

12:21.459 --> 12:22.498
Oh, this is a tough one.

12:22.499 --> 12:23.528
Is it?

12:23.529 --> 12:24.628
Is it, Dad?

12:24.629 --> 12:26.478
Well, on one hand, Kenny is my son.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.658
On the other hand, I choose Doug.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.668
- Yes!
- Seriously?

12:29.669 --> 12:31.578
Oh, don't look at me like that.

12:31.579 --> 12:32.668
It's just a game...

12:32.669 --> 12:34.568
a game that I have to
win, which I can't with you.

12:34.569 --> 12:36.558
Love you. Mean it.

12:36.559 --> 12:37.628
Picked last again.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.548
The only difference

12:39.549 --> 12:40.658
between gay dodgeball
and straight dodgeball

12:40.659 --> 12:42.639
is that I'm wearing someone
else's shorts.

12:45.459 --> 12:47.568
So, we're texting, and
then he just disappears.

12:47.569 --> 12:49.558
Apparently, that's called "ghosting."

12:49.559 --> 12:51.488
And then he shows
up, and he says to me...

12:51.489 --> 12:54.498
he says, "I'm alive. Can
I have a free haircut?"

12:54.499 --> 12:55.538
Jodi, look at me.

12:57.489 --> 13:00.588
Ghosts... Don't... Get... Haircuts.

13:00.589 --> 13:02.538
Block his number, you know why?

13:02.539 --> 13:04.588
Because ain't nobody got time for that.

13:04.589 --> 13:06.361
Eileen, you're

13:06.386 --> 13:08.488
so emotionally intelligent!

13:08.489 --> 13:10.598
I wish I would've come to
you sooner with my problems.

13:10.599 --> 13:12.668
Why? So you could throw a
pity party two months ago?

13:12.669 --> 13:15.488
Marcia, you know, everyone
else has been sharing.

13:15.489 --> 13:17.518
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

13:17.519 --> 13:19.478
Things are going quite
well in my world. Thank you.

13:19.479 --> 13:21.578
- Everything's fine, no problems?
- Zero.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.508
It's funny because I heard

13:23.509 --> 13:25.538
that your sister's fast-food
franchise has been struggling.

13:25.539 --> 13:28.448
Turns out there's nothing fast
about a drive-through salad bar.

13:28.449 --> 13:29.618
But she's working through it.

13:29.619 --> 13:31.518
You know, I think it's safe to say

13:31.519 --> 13:33.598
this is not the book
club that we signed up for.

13:33.599 --> 13:36.638
Everyone else seems to
be having a great time.

13:36.639 --> 13:39.448
Well, I vote for it going
back to being a regular book club

13:39.449 --> 13:40.548
where the focus is on the book.

13:40.549 --> 13:41.578
I think you're the only one

13:41.579 --> 13:43.438
not getting something out of this,

13:43.439 --> 13:44.518
but if you want to put it to a vote,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.448
everyone who agrees with Marcia,

13:46.449 --> 13:47.509
raise your hands.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.648
Fran, come on!

13:50.649 --> 13:54.478
I... Think I vote with Eileen.

13:54.479 --> 13:56.498
Oh, my god.

13:56.499 --> 13:57.649
Everyone who agrees with me?

13:59.469 --> 14:00.489
Yes.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.538
Well... I've had about enough of this.

14:06.539 --> 14:08.468
And by the way...

14:08.469 --> 14:09.498
You are no longer

14:09.499 --> 14:11.498
allowed to use my
Barnes & Noble discount.

14:11.499 --> 14:12.658
Hmph!

14:12.659 --> 14:15.448
You know, I think that's
the first time I've ever voted.

14:15.449 --> 14:17.548
What is Barnes & Noble?

14:17.549 --> 14:20.558
Well, ladies, I think this
was a very successful meeting,

14:20.559 --> 14:22.568
and we should end it on a high note.

14:22.569 --> 14:24.618
So, we'll see each other next month.

14:24.619 --> 14:26.578
But there's still so much to talk about.

14:26.579 --> 14:27.648
We just scratched the surface

14:27.649 --> 14:29.658
of Fran's relationship with her mom.

14:29.659 --> 14:31.558
Wait, what? We're still talking?

14:31.559 --> 14:33.518
Guess who
has a case of Charles Shaw

14:33.519 --> 14:34.568
in her trunk!

14:34.569 --> 14:37.558
- Yes!
- No. No!

14:37.559 --> 14:39.489
- No!
- No.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.568
I dodge bullets for a living!

14:50.569 --> 14:52.209
You're gonna have to
try harder than that!

14:55.549 --> 14:56.658
Ooh, sorry, Kenny!

14:56.659 --> 14:59.508
No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:59.509 --> 15:01.558
I'm sure I can relearn how
to read and write, eh?

15:01.559 --> 15:02.598
Ow! Okay, okay!

15:02.599 --> 15:03.608
I'm out!

15:03.609 --> 15:05.648
- And proud!
- Shut up, Zack!

15:06.579 --> 15:08.528
This sucks.

15:08.529 --> 15:10.548
My fun introduction to the gayborhood

15:10.549 --> 15:12.568
has turned into my worst nightmare.

15:12.569 --> 15:15.628
Meanwhile, my stupid dad's become
the mayor of boystown.

15:15.629 --> 15:16.558
Watch out!

15:16.559 --> 15:18.508
No!

15:21.569 --> 15:22.608
If only you were Asian, pat.

15:22.609 --> 15:23.639
What?

15:24.579 --> 15:25.599
You're back in, Kenny!

15:26.669 --> 15:28.468
No, you're not!

15:28.469 --> 15:29.608
Ow!

15:29.609 --> 15:31.628
I am your son by blood!

15:31.629 --> 15:33.598
Don't hate the player! Hate the game!

15:33.599 --> 15:36.458
I hate both... the
game and the player...

15:36.459 --> 15:37.568
who's not even supposed to be here!

15:37.569 --> 15:39.323
I mean, you're not even gay!

15:43.569 --> 15:45.468
You're not gay?

15:45.469 --> 15:47.644
This is gay dodgeball.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.528
You can't play if you're not gay.

15:49.529 --> 15:52.332
But I made him, and he's gay.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.392
Should've picked me.

15:58.727 --> 16:00.513
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:01.012 --> 16:04.850
I did it. I called Larry,
and I told him, it's over.

16:04.851 --> 16:06.690
Do you have an extra bed?

16:06.691 --> 16:07.920
I'm totally happy to bunk with you...

16:07.921 --> 16:10.770
if you have a pillow top.

16:10.771 --> 16:11.880
Are those my slippers?

16:11.881 --> 16:14.690
We have the same-size feet.

16:14.691 --> 16:16.750
We can share shoes all the time.

16:17.891 --> 16:19.790
- Let's have a sleepover!
- Yes!

16:19.791 --> 16:21.750
I just want to get
away from the diapers.

16:21.751 --> 16:22.720
It's so much.

16:22.721 --> 16:24.710
There's probably poop on my dress.

16:24.711 --> 16:25.750
Would you excuse me for a moment?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.700
You know, there's coasters
there you could be using.

16:27.701 --> 16:28.730
Thanks.

16:28.731 --> 16:29.820
Let's open another bottle!

16:29.821 --> 16:31.780
I cannot believe these women.

16:31.781 --> 16:34.700
They're lying around on
my couch, drinking my wine,

16:34.701 --> 16:35.800
acting like they live here.

16:35.801 --> 16:36.890
I know. That's my thing.

16:36.891 --> 16:38.750
I'm surprised you're sober.

16:38.751 --> 16:39.900
I prefer to be the only one drinking.

16:39.901 --> 16:41.800
I don't like to see
myself in other people.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.760
Mom, this party's getting out of hand.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.750
Someone just kissed the pope plate,

16:45.751 --> 16:47.780
and now it's covered in
lipstick and dorito dust.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.760
By the way, your
April is all booked up now.

16:49.761 --> 16:51.740
There is a Saturday free in May,

16:51.741 --> 16:53.810
but if Suzie finds an
Airbnb in Yosemite that fits 12,

16:53.811 --> 16:54.850
you're screwed.

16:54.851 --> 16:56.750
Well, I can't do this.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.730
This is why I didn't
want to be vulnerable.

16:58.731 --> 16:59.890
Vulnerability is disgusting.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.910
Plus, it's wearing my slippers.

17:01.911 --> 17:04.780
Oh, Marcia was
right. I ruined book club!

17:04.781 --> 17:06.760
It's okay to admit your mistakes.

17:06.761 --> 17:08.790
Hillary admitted she was
wrong about invading Iraq.

17:10.761 --> 17:11.800
It's all right here.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.849
Will someone please read the book?

17:12.851 --> 17:14.750
- Mm.
- Eileen?

17:14.751 --> 17:15.800
Grab some matches.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.920
We're writing down our greatest fears

17:16.921 --> 17:19.819
and then burning them.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.890
Now, that does sound fun.

17:21.891 --> 17:24.800
Easy, guys.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.880
Zack, I'm sorry
about the misunderstanding, man,

17:26.881 --> 17:28.850
but, come on, labels shouldn't matter.

17:28.851 --> 17:30.740
I kind of feel like

17:30.741 --> 17:32.770
a-a straight guy on a
gay team means love wins?

17:32.771 --> 17:33.880
Don't do that.

17:33.881 --> 17:35.830
No, look, rules are rules.

17:35.831 --> 17:37.750
We don't even let lesbians play.

17:37.751 --> 17:39.720
You know, maybe you
should just go try your luck

17:39.721 --> 17:40.810
over at desperate
divorced dads dodgeball.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.740
Wait, is that really a thing?

17:42.741 --> 17:44.700
'Cause I'm seriously interested.

17:44.701 --> 17:47.840
Can you believe
that? He's kicking me out.

17:47.841 --> 17:50.820
Yeah. Yeah, I can
believe it, and he should.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.740
Wait a minute. What...

17:52.741 --> 17:53.900
Is this about
something more than dodgeball?

17:53.901 --> 17:57.750
You completely
steamrolled all over my day.

17:57.751 --> 17:58.900
You just invited yourself along,

17:58.901 --> 18:00.740
and then you picked Doug over me.

18:00.741 --> 18:01.880
Oh, but, Kenny, look at him.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.740
- He's a god.
- Mmm, I know.

18:03.741 --> 18:05.780
He's like a more
approachable Jason Derulo,

18:05.781 --> 18:07.790
but stop trying to distract me.

18:07.791 --> 18:09.690
Just go home, and I will meet you there.

18:09.691 --> 18:10.291
Come on, Kenny.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.760
Fine. If that's what you want.

18:13.761 --> 18:15.810
It is.

18:15.811 --> 18:17.730
This is my community!

18:17.731 --> 18:19.750
These are my
friends! They understand me!

18:19.751 --> 18:20.761
Game on, twink!

18:21.851 --> 18:24.740
Filbert, we are on the same team!

18:31.851 --> 18:33.700
Thanks for meeting me.

18:33.701 --> 18:35.760
Wow, it's really empty here.

18:35.761 --> 18:37.710
Yeah, well...

18:37.711 --> 18:38.820
As you know, my sister's
salad-bar franchise

18:38.821 --> 18:39.910
is doing very poorly.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.860
What did you want to talk about?

18:41.861 --> 18:43.740
Well, I wanted to meet in person

18:43.741 --> 18:44.900
so there's no evidence we
had this conversation,

18:44.901 --> 18:46.820
but...

18:46.821 --> 18:48.810
I'm conceding my win.

18:48.811 --> 18:51.850
I don't want those women.
The book club is all yours.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.750
Are you kidding me? I don't want them.

18:53.751 --> 18:54.890
They're a real whiny group.

18:54.891 --> 18:57.780
I know! Ain't nobody got time for that.

18:58.901 --> 19:02.700
Well, we finally agree on something.

19:02.701 --> 19:03.646
That feels weird.

19:04.981 --> 19:07.720
Maybe we could start a new book club

19:07.721 --> 19:09.800
where we're pleasant, but distant.

19:09.801 --> 19:12.760
And people's private
problems stay private...

19:12.761 --> 19:14.800
including mine.

19:14.801 --> 19:15.841
Agreed.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.790
But to be clear, we still
hate each other, right?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.071
Oh, of course. That's our thing.

19:21.831 --> 19:23.219
Will you buy something from my

19:23.244 --> 19:24.700
sister's salad-bar franchise?

19:24.701 --> 19:25.750
Sure.

19:25.751 --> 19:26.740
Will you add avocado?

19:26.741 --> 19:27.890
If I must.

19:27.891 --> 19:29.710
Maybe toss a protein on there.

19:29.711 --> 19:30.910
Pump the brakes, Marcia.

19:35.881 --> 19:38.820
- Dad, do you have a second?
- Sure.

19:38.821 --> 19:40.760
- How was the game?
- Uh, actually,

19:40.761 --> 19:42.690
Dr. Filbert got a nose
bleed that wouldn't stop,

19:42.691 --> 19:43.800
so we had to call the game early.

19:43.801 --> 19:46.850
Oh, buddy, I'm so sorry I
stole your thunder today.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.890
That's okay.

19:48.891 --> 19:50.770
I don't think that's the group of gays

19:50.771 --> 19:51.850
I was looking for.

19:51.851 --> 19:53.890
Actually, it turns
out, Saturday is gay NASCAR.

19:53.891 --> 19:55.574
Oh, I love NAS...

19:55.901 --> 19:57.810
Nope.

19:58.911 --> 20:01.770
Look, Dad, I'm sorry I outed you.

20:01.771 --> 20:02.920
I know that you were having fun.

20:02.921 --> 20:04.760
No, you don't need to apologize.

20:04.761 --> 20:05.780
I'm the one that's sorry.

20:05.781 --> 20:07.890
I mean, I... Just got so caught up

20:07.891 --> 20:09.880
in trying to help
you find your community

20:09.881 --> 20:11.860
that I didn't even
realize I needed one, too.

20:11.861 --> 20:13.860
Well, you did help me.

20:13.861 --> 20:15.790
And I wouldn't have
gone in the coffee house

20:15.791 --> 20:17.760
if it wasn't for you, so thanks.

20:21.701 --> 20:22.860
I will say, I kind of
ruled the gayborhood.

20:22.861 --> 20:24.730
- Yeah.
- Right?

20:24.731 --> 20:26.820
By the way, as it turns out,
"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"...

20:26.821 --> 20:27.800
not about fishing.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.860
About Madonna taking over Argentina.

20:32.751 --> 20:35.730
You know, you have the
DVDs in the wrong cases, Dad.

20:35.731 --> 20:36.556
- Ah.
- Yeah,

20:36.581 --> 20:37.720
"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"

20:37.721 --> 20:40.214
- is not a musical.
- I got it, I got it.

20:43.419 --> 20:45.890
All right, Dad, here we are.

20:45.891 --> 20:47.850
Uh, just great.

20:47.851 --> 20:49.438
They all got cool shoes on.

20:49.565 --> 20:50.880
Hey, buddy, we'll get you new shoes

20:50.881 --> 20:51.880
when you wear these ones out.

20:51.881 --> 20:53.890
I don't know about this.

20:53.891 --> 20:55.685
Oh, these guys look like

20:55.686 --> 20:56.900
they all know each other already.

20:56.901 --> 20:59.860
Well, you want us to go in with you?

20:59.861 --> 21:02.023
No, it's fine.

21:02.176 --> 21:03.764
It's single-dad dodgeball,

21:03.874 --> 21:05.860
not kids-of-divorce dodgeball.

21:05.861 --> 21:06.871
Wait, does that exist?

21:11.881 --> 21:13.258
- Go get 'em, champ!
- Remember

21:13.283 --> 21:14.840
to stand up straight, tiger!

21:14.841 --> 21:17.721
Shh! I told you not to talk
to me in front of the other dads!
