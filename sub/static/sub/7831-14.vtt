12:36.956 --> 12:38.890
Wait a minute.

12:38.991 --> 12:41.789
We had a cooler
full of snacks on the bus.

12:41.894 --> 12:45.455
Hey, yeah. And I think I know
how I can get it.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.330
Hey! I need that to live.

[All Cheering]

13:24.537 --> 13:26.732
Stop!

13:26.839 --> 13:30.798
We may have to live on this food for a long time.
So no more till tomorrow.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.811
- But I'm hungry now.
- Yeah.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.813
- Me too.
- Yeah.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.076
Who put the duchess of dork
in charge?

13:38.184 --> 13:41.517
No one, but if we're gonna survive,
we need rules and order.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.918
Let's not forget what we learned
in the U.N. club.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.821

14:00.840 --> 14:02.808
Where'd all the food go?

14:06.745 --> 14:09.475
Mornir.
Is it time to eat?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.948
<i>Looks like you already did.</i>

14:12.051 --> 14:15.214
- What are you talkir about?
- You ate our food!

14:15.321 --> 14:17.346
Thanks a lot, Milhouse.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.924
Now we're all gonna die
because of you.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.391
But I swear I didn't do it!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.638
You wouldn't dare hurt me.

14:33.739 --> 14:37.732
You forget that I have the glasses.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.004
Yoink!

14:40.112 --> 14:43.912
Well, now that you've got
everything you need, I'll just, you know...

14:44.016 --> 14:45.916
get out of your hair.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.952
Not so fast, two eyes!

14:48.053 --> 14:51.045
Come on. Let's slice him open
and get our food back.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.956
Wait! We're not savages.
We live in a society of law.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.358
Milhouse has the right
to a fair trial.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.328

Welcome to the Internet, my friend.
How can I help you?

15:29.628 --> 15:33.359

15:38.470 --> 15:41.906
that's compatible with my token ring
Ethernet LAN configuration?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.508

15:47.947 --> 15:50.472

- Ha, ha. Made you rise.
- <i>Your Honor...</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:02.856
the defense calls its first and only witness:
Milhouse Van Houten.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.759
- Oh, wow! I can't believe it.
- [Chattering]

16:08.334 --> 16:10.894
Milhouse, did you steal the food?

16:11.003 --> 16:12.971
Nuh-uh. No way.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.131
Could anyone else have taken it?

16:15.240 --> 16:18.209
Well, I guess you could have.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.278
Milhouse, I am defending you.

16:20.379 --> 16:24.247
Oh. Sorry. I'm just saying,
it was either you or the monster.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.319
Monster? [Scoffs]
Oh, please.

16:27.419 --> 16:31.480
I remind you. We are not here
to debate the existence of monsters.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.148
[All Grumbling]

16:33.258 --> 16:35.783
The defense has
just one more question.

16:35.894 --> 16:40.228
Did any one of you
actually see Milhouse eat the food?

16:43.335 --> 16:46.862
- I rest my case.
- Prosecutor, your witness.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.251
You liar! You did it, you lying jerk!
Take that! You did it!

17:01.353 --> 17:04.446
Objection!
He's not asking any questions.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.491
Hmm. I'm gonna allow this.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.027
- [Grunting]
- Ow. Ow. Ooh.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.529
Prosecution rests.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.934
After careful deliberation...

17:17.036 --> 17:20.767
it's my opinion that Milhouse
probably did eat the food...

17:20.873 --> 17:26.140
<i>but since there's no proof,</i>
<i>I must find him not guilty.</i>

17:26.244 --> 17:29.271
- All right!
- [All Grumbling]

17:29.381 --> 17:31.872
But he ate our food!

17:31.984 --> 17:35.681
- The law has spoken.
- Ah, sucks to the law. [Grunts]

17:35.788 --> 17:38.256

17:38.357 --> 17:42.191
Stop! Leave Milhouse alone.
Help me out here, Bart.

17:42.294 --> 17:45.388
I don't know, Lise. To be honest,
that verdict made me pretty angry.

17:45.497 --> 17:47.692
Bart's with us, law girl.
Step aside.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.963

- Hey, man. Leave my sister alone!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.265
Oh, so you're one of them.

17:53.372 --> 17:57.035
So be it.
Kill the dorks!

Kill the dorks! Bash their butts!

Oh, they have the Internet

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Get out of sight, Marge.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.667
- I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation.
- [Groans]

18:30.776 --> 18:33.438
- Mr. Simpson?
- You don't look so rich.

18:33.545 --> 18:36.241
Don't let the haircut fool you.
I'm exceedingly wealthy.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.146
Get a load of the bowl job, Marge.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.378
Your Internet ad
was brought to my attention...

18:41.487 --> 18:45.583
but I can't figure out what, if anything,
CompuGlobalHyperMeganet does.

18:45.691 --> 18:49.787
So, rather than risk competing with you,
I've decided simply to buy you out.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.160
This is it, Marge.
I poured my heart and soul into this business...

18:53.265 --> 18:55.165
and now it's finally paying off.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.758
We're rich!
Richer than astronauts!

18:57.870 --> 19:00.395
Homer, quiet!
You'll queer the deal.

19:00.506 --> 19:04.875
Oh. Right.
I reluctantly accept your proposal.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.502
Well, everyone always does.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.774
- Buy him out, boys.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.850
Yeah.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.682
Here, Milhouse.
You go first.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.857
Okay. Now throw the vine back.

<i>They're trapped in the cave. Move in for the kill.</i>

Uh, that's right.

- [Growls]

20:40.739 --> 20:43.299
[All Screaming]

20:48.447 --> 20:52.315
Your monster appears to be
nothing but a run-of-the-mill wild boar.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.385
Hey. Look at his tusk.

20:54.486 --> 20:57.319
<i>So the boar ate our food.</i>

20:57.422 --> 21:01.085
Oh. Sorry about that whole

21:01.193 --> 21:03.127
Yeah.
Well, you should be!

21:03.228 --> 21:06.629
I only stole two sandwiches
and a bag of Doritos.

21:06.732 --> 21:11.431
Hey. If a boar can survive here,
there must be a source of food.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.937
Look. He's licking
the slime off that rock.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.838
That's what he's been eating.
Slime!

21:17.943 --> 21:21.401
And there's enough slime for all of us.
We're saved!

21:29.488 --> 21:33.447
All that slime
made this boar extra tender.

Mmm! Mmm!
