01:20.747 --> 01:24.876
<i>As a get-out-of-prison gift,</i>
<i>Neri had my astrological chart done.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:26.920
<i>Or she downloaded it from the Internet.</i>

01:27.003 --> 01:31.174
<i>Either way, she thought it might give me</i>
<i>some insight into myself.</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:35.220
<i>I'm a Gemini.</i>
<i>In Latin, Gemini means "twins."</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:39.390
<i>So there's this inherent duality</i>
<i>to me, right?</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.518
<i>If you believe this shit.</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:44.062
Sorry.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.772
<i>Gemini is an air sign.</i>

01:47.565 --> 01:49.317
<i>Our metal is quicksilver.</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:51.778
-Sorry.
-This side is going down, dummy.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.696
I know. I'm a big dummy.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.828
<i>A Gemini's lucky color is yellow.</i>

02:02.330 --> 02:05.208
<i>One of the negative traits of people</i>
<i>with my birthday</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:06.876
<i>is that we're often stressed</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:10.713
<i>and torn between personal freedom</i>
<i>and ties of love that hold us back.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.926
<i>But on the positive side,</i>
<i>I have the same birthday as Liam Neeson.</i>

02:16.052 --> 02:17.595
-Hi, guys.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.848
-I brought home pak boong.

02:19.931 --> 02:23.476
That's morning glory.
I'm gonna be really fluent in Thai soon.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.354
-At least Thai menu Thai.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.606
-I'm not completely sure it's vegan...

02:28.690 --> 02:30.567
...because they do put fish sauce
in everything,

02:30.650 --> 02:33.444
but it's definitely vegetable-forward.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.780
Do you want some now
or should I put it in the fridge?

02:35.864 --> 02:39.909
Come on, Goodall. Make a poo-poo.
You can do it.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.244
I'll put it in the fridge.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.705
Piper, we've asked you to please

02:43.788 --> 02:46.541
not bring home non-biodegradable
takeout containers.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.502
We are a zero-waste house. Almost.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.212
And I heard you. Ta-da.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.256
-Oh!
-Oh! It's okay.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.301
<i>My birthday tarot card</i>
<i>is the Chariot.</i>

02:56.384 --> 02:58.553
<i>If the Chariot card</i>
<i>is presented upright...</i>

02:59.554 --> 03:01.639
<i>...it's a signal</i>
<i>to enjoy the fruits of your efforts.</i>

03:01.723 --> 03:04.350
<i>"You've done it, kid. Time to celebrate."</i>

03:04.434 --> 03:06.853
Maybe we should try
that running

03:06.936 --> 03:08.354
No, no, that's for pee-pee.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.149
We're trying to get her to poop.
She gave us poop face.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.609
-I mean...
I'm gonna head to bed.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.818
...wouldn't we be happy with either one?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.820
Good luck with the infant potty...

03:15.904 --> 03:16.821
Oh!

03:16.905 --> 03:18.615
Good night, P.
-...situation.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.908
It might be confusing.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.244
I think we're supposed to
get her to pick one, aren't we?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.121
Maybe we should watch the YouTube again?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.080
What were the key words?

03:26.164 --> 03:28.791
Yeah, elimination communication.

03:31.502 --> 03:36.132
Or the, um, the lady with the accent.
<i>The Nappyless Technique.</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:42.180
<i>Hi, I'm Sandy.</i>
<i>This is episode 3 of </i>Nappy-Free Life.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.390
<i>Today, we're going to talk about...</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:48.102
Hey, you guys, could you remember
to pick up vegetable oil

03:48.186 --> 03:49.896
for the car before Wednesday?

03:49.979 --> 03:54.400
I'm very grateful
and you are all very, very attractive.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.277
-Yes.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.574
My probation officer
finally gave me permission, remember?

04:02.158 --> 04:03.451
I'm gonna visit my wife?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.453
God, I love saying that.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.746
Oh, no. Wednesday's no good.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.790
Goodall has the doctor on Wednesday.
We need the car.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.210
Oh, that's right! Wellness visit.

04:12.293 --> 04:17.215
Who's following the protocols
of Western medicine

04:17.298 --> 04:18.675
Oh, now make a pee-pee.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.721
Wait, I thought we agreed on poop.
Did we not just agree on poop?

04:24.222 --> 04:28.601
Oh, my gosh. You're right. Poop.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.103
But you said that I could use it.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.647
How about taking an Uber?
Is Uber still bad?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.023
-I can't remember.
-Still bad.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.401
I can't take an Uber.
I can't afford to pay you rent.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.861
You think I can afford to take an Uber
to Litchfield?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.781
You know, uh, actually, I wanted
to talk to you about the rent thing,

04:41.864 --> 04:43.866
because, you know,
we could be Airbnb-ing that room.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.202
Who's vacationing in Jackson Heights?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.745
Oh, you'd be surprised.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.582
I mean, they can go
for up to $62 a night around here.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.793
I don't know why you won't just ask Dad
to help you out.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.254
<i>Uh, because my calls</i>
<i>go straight to voicemail?</i>

05:02.552 --> 05:03.928
I was really counting on the car.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.931
Oh! Shit! We have shit!

05:08.641 --> 05:10.226
Good job!

05:10.810 --> 05:14.355
Yay!

05:14.439 --> 05:15.732
Good job!

05:17.608 --> 05:18.776
Oh, shit.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.696
Love you, too, Stretch.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.824
Rec time. Line up for rec time.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.287
I got nothing for you, Murphy.
Get out of my way.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.749
Oh, but you do.
And you don't even know it.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.544
See, there's this hot dog-eating contest
in Coney Island this weekend.

05:36.627 --> 05:41.132
My brother is comin' through on Wednesday.
Kyle, not Shawnie.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.551
I'm not giving you my visitation time.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
It's my brother.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.138
It's my wife.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.683
Your wife.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.393
Not missin' that one.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.520
I mean, my new bunkie
might be an angry thug,

05:54.604 --> 05:56.689
but she's quiet
and she ain't half as gassy.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.941
Maybe that marriage of yours
is working out so well

05:59.025 --> 06:00.693
'cause you don't got to share a room.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.237
Why don't you steal a time slot
from one of your lackeys?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.406
Isn't that what I'm doin' here?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.492
<i>If I punched her in the face</i>
<i>right now,</i>

06:07.575 --> 06:09.577
<i>just sucker-punched her nose</i>
<i>into her brain,</i>

06:09.660 --> 06:10.828
<i>how much would that cost me?</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:13.915
<i>Shit. I promised Piper I'd be good.</i>
<i>I'm being good.</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
If you're not in line,
you're not going to the yard.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.837
Maybe you should take a poke at me, Vause.

06:19.921 --> 06:24.175
Then you'd get a shot and, lo and behold,
a spot would open up in visitation.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.804
Or maybe you'll get a shot
doin' somethin' else.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.889
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.395
Might as well give in now.
God friggin' loves me.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.670
I want drugs.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.882
How about I tell you a story instead?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.135
You see, I got these great stories.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.639
You'll be back.
Humans are narrative junkies.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.308
Hey. You all got drugs?

07:16.978 --> 07:17.895
I want drugs.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.441
Do you have any drugs?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.822
Thank you, <i>mamacita.</i>

07:27.905 --> 07:30.283
Hey, put your eyes back in your head.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.411
Baby, I'm only scopin' out customers.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.498
Relax. That's just a ding
for the cash register.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.376
You know you're Daddy's girl.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.216
Hello, my friend.
Today is your lucky day.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.969
I have here the finest hooch
in all of Max.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.473
Made with all-natural ingredients.
Transport your spirit with my spirit.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.310
I can guarantee you,
there's no hand sanitizer in my hooch.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.479
I cannot say the same for my competitors.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.022
I want drugs.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.358
Alcohol is a depressant,
it is a euphoriant,

08:04.442 --> 08:06.068
it is a sedative, it is a drug.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
I want drugs.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.614
I got drugs for you. Follow me.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.116
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.951
Well, ain't that some shit.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.954
We all got scooped by the ghost.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.540
Maybe we need to bust that ghost.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.752
Comes a time you gotta
make an example out of somebody.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.171
Yeah. Kill that bitch.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.841
Easy, tiger.
Fear is what we're goin' for.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.136
Fear's what gets everybody back in line.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.389
They won't be able to cut a deal anyway.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.985
I ain't seen her
since she got caught.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.947
Yeah, man. That's just real.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.740
It's that 187 bitch.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.867
Damn. What's she gonna do?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.371
She make me sweat
in all my folding places.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.248
I know.

09:01.958 --> 09:06.295
Hey, roomie. Good to see you
make an appearance in the fresh air.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.141
Please let there be a fight.
Please let there be a fight.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.438
I want drugs.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.775
Good luck with that.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.529
Damn it.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.116
-Yeah.
-That's not enough.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.410
-Oh, my Gorgonzola.
-Oy.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.537
She actually came outside.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.419
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't-- Don't do that. Don't.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.129
What I know her.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.549
No, you don't, all right?
You don't know her.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.593
Whoever you knew ain't there no more.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.179
Uh, no, she is right there.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.432
Okay. You're not really understanding me
right now, okay?

09:59.515 --> 10:03.144
I realize that that was once your friend,
but now she's a convicted murderer.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.021
She's-- She's a lifer.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.481
I'm sorry.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.444
You know, she used to be really fun.

10:12.111 --> 10:17.116
Like, she almost always
wore a smiling face.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.746
And her dancing shoes.
Her singing pants.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.665
-No.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.045
Just used to sing a lot
and mostly wear pants.

10:30.129 --> 10:33.633
-Yeah.
-Doesn't do that anymore, sing.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.595
-Still wears pants, though.
-Hmm.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.098
Just now is a murderer no-smiler.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.977
Yeah, and so was the guard
that she shot in the face.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.146
So, maybe that's fair, right?

10:47.605 --> 10:48.564
I guess.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.734
I mean, prison's hard, my friend,
you know?

10:51.817 --> 10:54.612
It's like, while I'm the exception,

10:55.321 --> 10:57.490
I feel that I've gotten better
since being here.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
Most people get worse.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.619
Man.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.788
Drugs? I want them.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.331
Fuck off, junkie.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.968
Okay, animals. Back to your cages.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.313
I don't hear no huffin' and puffin'.
Let's go, Red.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.692
You know how much a personal trainer
would cost you on the outside?

11:33.150 --> 11:36.195
You're gettin'
the spoils of the rich up in here.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.534
Come on. Show me what you got.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.036
I'm taking a nap.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.832
Uh-uh. You've already napped.
Too many excuses, old lady.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.333
Haul your ass out of bed.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.963
A body in motion stays in motion.
A body in bed gets depressed.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.682
Red?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.184
What?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.438
Do Russians do pork?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.774
What do you mean?

12:15.025 --> 12:20.614
Every Puerto Rican family
has its own recipe for pernil, roast pork.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.116
Mmm.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.035
We love our pork.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.246
Buzhenina.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.249
That's our roast pork.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.126
Tons of garlic?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.420
Mustard...

12:35.713 --> 12:36.964
bay leaves...

12:38.507 --> 12:41.427
sweet onion, peppercorns,

12:42.511 --> 12:43.512
clove,

12:45.389 --> 12:46.265
paprika.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.935
Well, pernil is all about the garlic.

12:50.519 --> 12:55.733
We use maybe a clove or two.
Garlic can be so overpowering.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.445
Well, that's the whole point.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.114
<i>El poder de ajo.</i>

13:02.448 --> 13:03.824
Never.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.743
What?

13:06.243 --> 13:10.122
Only fresh.
I would never use garlic powder.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.708
Not powder.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.752
<i>Poder.</i>

13:15.461 --> 13:17.087
That means "power."

13:18.380 --> 13:22.218
Quarter teaspoon baking powder,

13:23.344 --> 13:26.263
three cups of flour,

13:27.890 --> 13:29.183
two eggs.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.353
Are we playing "Guess the Recipe" again?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.317
Every cake in the world
could start like that.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.487
You're gonna have to give me
more ingredients.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.281
Ingredients in what?

13:47.827 --> 13:48.786
Red?

13:49.954 --> 13:50.955
You doin' okay?

13:51.247 --> 13:54.458
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.751
I know.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.920
But we made a deal.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.590
We're gonna get each other through this.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.635
We both gotta hold up our ends.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.599
Red?

14:21.026 --> 14:23.404
I know that guy thinks
we're melting down a body.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.660
"That's a lot of lye, ladies."
I mean, come on, shut the fuck up.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.621
Well, now we have to kill him
'cause he's a witness.

14:33.122 --> 14:37.710
If lye can be used to break down a corpse,
how is it safe for soap?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.879
-When the fat and lye are combined...
-Uh-huh.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
...there's a chemical reaction...

14:42.006 --> 14:43.674
-Yeah.
-...that turns the lye into salt.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.301
-It's called saponification.
-Uh-huh.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.345
-Huh. That's a good word.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.223
Uh, uh...
-Oh.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.643
I'm starving.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.355
Do you wanna eat here?
I could do noodles.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.941
Mmm, I don't know.
It looks a little sketch.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.193
I thought you were starving.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.029
Yeah, but I don't wanna put crap
into my body.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.950
You did ecstasy Friday night,
but you won't put pad thai in your body?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.953
There are dead flies on the windowsill.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.581
There were no dead flies in my ecstasy.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.094
Excuse me, miss?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.228
Lek, you have me workin' tomorrow.
I told you I need it off.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.897
-No.
-But I have--

15:40.814 --> 15:42.566
Tom kha gai does not have any nuts.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.778
No, coconut is not a real nut.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.363
Can we please get the check, please?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.823
Oh, right. Coming.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.455
You know what else isn't a real nut?
My left ball.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.207
So I can safely dip that
in her soup, right?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.878
Ha. People can be difficult. So, listen.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.672
I need tomorrow off.
Remember how we talked about it?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.465
I thought you needed this afternoon off.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.843
Yeah, both.
I need this afternoon and tomorrow.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.012
-Get the guy's card.
-Oh, right. Coming.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.894
Um, anyhow, I have to go visit my...

16:20.229 --> 16:22.314
friend upstate,

16:22.398 --> 16:25.109
and it's really important.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.152
And it takes,
like, three buses to get there. So you're leaving this afternoon
to get upstate?

16:29.279 --> 16:32.825
No. I have an appointment this afternoon.
Also really important.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.035
Well, if it's really important...

16:38.664 --> 16:41.875
The dishwasher wants Saturday off
for his pickleball league finals.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.128
You willing to wash dishes
after your Saturday shift?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.087
Pickleball?

16:45.170 --> 16:48.048
It's like badminton meets ping-pong
meets tennis.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.133
You in for dishes or not?

16:49.216 --> 16:51.719
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.934
Can I also get my check early
since I'm not gonna be here tomorrow?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.145
Nope. Bring the guy back his card.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.232
Have a great day.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.949
I'm so close.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.417
Yo, what the fuck?

17:24.501 --> 17:25.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.130
Easy there. Easy there.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.507
This is all part of the plan, baby.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.509
I knew you were fucking cheating on me.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.178
You're not listening.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.180
This was business.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.558
Okay, we want her sellin' for us,
not herself.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.979
I put myself at risk, my family,
and this is how you do me?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.523
You were supposed to scare her,
not fuck her.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.068
I pivoted.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.409
He's a fighter.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.747
And they told Vinnie the eyes
would get less bulgy once he gains weight.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.458
And all this hair all over his body,
that'll fall out.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.628
But you know what? I don't know.
We are a hairy people.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.922
Hey, I like his, uh, toes.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.424
-They look like little peas.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.383
Hey, ladies.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.678
Oh, hey. Vinnie sent over
some new pictures of Sterling.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.597
You wanna see it? He has a new hat.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.726
I still can't believe
you named your baby Sterling.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.688
Oh, Vause, this is America.
I can't give him some immigrant name.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.400
Ethnic is out.
Besides, Vinnie loves <i>Mad Men.</i>

18:31.527 --> 18:33.737
Sterling Carmine Muccio.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.657
It's a good thing
that you kept the "Carmine" in there

18:36.740 --> 18:39.159
in case white nationalist trends reverse.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.495
He gained half an ounce since Monday.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.081
Don't be freaked out by the tubes.
He's gonna be fine.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.208
All the boys in my family come early.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.460
Must be very disappointing
for their wives.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.380
They don't have wives. They're babies.
This is not India.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.965
It's a joke, sweetheart.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.092
He's very cute.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.635
Isn't he?

18:57.386 --> 19:00.639
Listen, I was wondering if either of you
had an old phone I could buy off you?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.642
Huh. So much for
keepin' your nose clean, huh?

19:03.725 --> 19:07.020
Yeah, I know
what you want a phone for.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.190
When the... when the wifey's away...

19:10.274 --> 19:11.275
McCullough?

19:11.358 --> 19:13.527
-Whoa!

19:14.862 --> 19:17.489
That's not my intention, but...

19:17.948 --> 19:19.533
-Wow!
-Mmm-hmm.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.536
Guess she's from Texas.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.790
All right. So what do you really
need this phone for?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.835
<i>I thought</i>
<i>it was a pretty good plan.</i>

19:32.462 --> 19:36.258
Yellow. Reverse. Green. Reverse.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.137
Blue. Skip. Uno!

19:42.431 --> 19:46.268
Oh! You fuckin' cunt.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.438
Yeah.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.316
Blue. Reverse. Uno.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.735
And then, why don't you just take...

19:58.906 --> 20:01.325
Deal. Let's go. Another one.

21:15.023 --> 21:15.857
What?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.110
I thought I--

21:20.320 --> 21:23.615
Nothing. You can go back to your book.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.661
<i>You can't always calculate</i>
<i>for outside interference in these things.</i>

21:27.744 --> 21:28.787
<i>I was back at square one.</i>

21:34.376 --> 21:36.044
<i>At least, I thought I was.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:41.383
I need to talk to you. Now.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.013
Somebody's in a mood.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.018
Nobody look at my cards.
I'll know if you looked.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.732
Kind of in the middle of a game there.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.319
I just saved your ass, bitch.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.738
Your fuckin' phone went off.

22:03.947 --> 22:04.990
What?

22:08.869 --> 22:09.911
It's not my phone.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.622
No, it was just under your pillow.

22:12.706 --> 22:19.588
So you mean to tell me that somebody else
got a screensaver of your ugly face?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.382
It's a fuckin' setup.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.468
Not even lookin' at the camera.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.762
You really think I would use this
as my wallpaper?

22:26.845 --> 22:30.182
I am much better lookin' than that photo.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.813
Just get rid of it
and keep your trouble away from me.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.067
I told you...

22:43.487 --> 22:44.696
it's not my phone.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.201
Why are you still talkin'?

22:49.785 --> 22:52.371
I don't give a fuck. Just get rid of it.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.290
And while you at it,
dump that janky-ass shiv

22:55.374 --> 22:58.085
you also got under your pillow,
shitty-ass hider.

22:58.168 --> 23:02.756
You goin' through my stuff now?
You got some nerve, Jefferson.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.800
I don't mess with your shit.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.886
Hey. Hey, you got one second
to give that back.

23:07.969 --> 23:12.057
Oh, oh, is this private?
Then you a shitty-ass hider.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.143
Of course your appeal got denied.
Ain't nothing appealing about your--

23:18.730 --> 23:20.065
Hey. Hey! Jefferson!

23:21.525 --> 23:23.485
<i>Okay, so maybe my plan was a bust,</i>

23:23.568 --> 23:25.529
<i>and I still owe Lorna</i>
<i>a three-pack of underwear,</i>

23:25.612 --> 23:29.491
<i>a book light, cotton swabs,</i>
<i>vanilla wafers and a clear thermal mug,</i>

23:29.574 --> 23:33.620
<i>the 32-ounce, not the 20,</i>
<i>but it all worked out anyway, didn't it?</i>

23:35.247 --> 23:36.957
<i>Guess God friggin' loves me.</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:45.715
We've been down here for too long.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.260
Red is starting to shut down.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.429
And I'm telling you,
I'm not far behind her.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.847
This is a human rights violation.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.641
She's the one who fucking did this.
I'm the injured party.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.476
I don't know why I should end up
in the dungeon, too.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.811
Is she right?
Should we bring her back up?

23:57.894 --> 24:01.064
You're joking, right?
We found a cell phone with her face on it.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.608
Plus, it's Badison, man.
You know that she must've started it.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.362
I didn't start shit.
This crazy killer went nuts on me!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.947
Get her in there
so we don't have to hear her shit.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.783
Hellman, you all of all people
shouldn't wanna see me down here.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.703
Hellman!

24:15.745 --> 24:16.830
Yes.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.170
You know, I thought you might be different

24:23.253 --> 24:25.255
'cause I didn't see your name
on that game.

24:26.756 --> 24:27.799
What game?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.011
The game the guards played with us.
You know, six points for a fight.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.888
Three points for a suicide attempt.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.890
Whatever.
Like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.101
I mean, I'm really down here

24:38.185 --> 24:41.563
because you guys don't want me
to tell everyone you're the animals.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.316
Less talking. More walking.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.785
-Wrap it up, ladies.
Nice show, Z.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.371
I know, right?
I got a face for radio.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.583
-What the...
-Oh, my God.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.045
You gettin' to be a real Mariah.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.048
-No.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.510
I mean Mariah.
Like, nobody can work with you.

25:13.220 --> 25:17.140
Sorry, Cindy,
but, like, the show's gotta come first.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.610
Prison really does make people mean.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.778
Yeah.

25:30.195 --> 25:34.449
But sometimes,
people deserve to be treated like shit.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.663
Wait, you didn't deserve that.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.548
You did the right thing.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.052
Taystee shot that guard.
What were you supposed to do?

25:54.135 --> 25:56.680
Whoa, whoa. What are you talkin' about?

25:57.931 --> 26:00.892
T? T didn't shoot a guard.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.311
-No, no.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.272
You were there.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.525
You saw the stormtroopers do it.

26:09.651 --> 26:16.491
But the judge and the jury
both said that she was guilty.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.246
So she's a no-smiling, lifer murderer now.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.207
Of course she ain't smilin'.
She got screwed by me, by...

26:24.291 --> 26:26.501
By everybody.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.505
Suzanne, everything is broken
and life is unfair.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.673
When are you gonna learn that?

26:34.718 --> 26:37.220
Okay, ladies, here we go.

26:37.887 --> 26:42.767
Warmin' up. And step and clap.
And step and clap.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.771
And step and clap. And step and clap.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.773
Whoo! Stomp that hoe.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.942
Take a step back.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.819
Whoo! Stomp that hoe.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.331
Fuck off, you little pervert!

27:04.414 --> 27:06.541
Can't you chill with that shit?
We got drugs in the car.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.336
Damn. Now he's gonna go home
and jerk off to the two us.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.048
-He kind of broke the mood for me.
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

27:13.131 --> 27:15.925
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.637
-All right. I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.680
Come on. Come on, come on.  Fuck.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.977
That was fucking good!

27:26.061 --> 27:27.979
-Whoo!

27:28.063 --> 27:28.980
It's good to be home!

27:29.064 --> 27:32.567
-Yeah, well, you ain't home.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.445
You in the back of an old Ford Fusion.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.408
I need you to get your act together, okay?

27:40.492 --> 27:44.329
'Cause I need to be able to leave
that Walmart shopper and get my life back.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.706
What are you talkin' about, "leave"

27:47.332 --> 27:50.585
You don't break up with the pipeline.
We need him right now.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.505
I told you about his grandmother, right?
How she chews?

27:53.588 --> 27:55.465
Yeah, well, I got you beat
with Margarita's mother.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.469
Not only does the fuckin' woman
never sleep,

27:59.552 --> 28:02.305
she's writing a romance novel
on a typewriter.

28:02.972 --> 28:07.769
A real typewriter.
The fucking clacking is driving me nuts.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.648
And then she wants to read sections
aloud to us

28:12.232 --> 28:17.946
about Rodrigo's glistening abs
in the fight for the love of María Elena.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.073
It's fuckin' horrible.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.121
You gonna be good?

28:26.204 --> 28:28.665
I'll be good. Say hi to Margarita for me.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.208
-I'll do more than that.
-Hey.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.844
<i>This was my life.</i>

28:41.344 --> 28:44.889
<i>Larry's parents have a beach house.</i>
<i>We used it a lot.</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:48.351
-Oh-ho-ho!
-Oh!

28:48.435 --> 28:50.478
Yes! Stacked up at the goal line.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.188
I hate football season.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.941
Sorry. It had to be done.
I couldn't let you score.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.444
You know, I was named
after Lawrence Taylor.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.654
The greatest defensive player
in the history of the NFL.

29:00.029 --> 29:03.533
You were named after your Uncle Lemmy
on your father's side.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.536
-The podiatrist.
-Yeah, and Lawrence Taylor.

29:06.619 --> 29:07.746
-Right.
-It was a twofer.

29:07.829 --> 29:08.747
Yeah.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.416
Wanna go back to the house
and fool around?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.209
I'm all sandy now.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.252
Let's take a shower.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.962
Where are your parents?

29:16.045 --> 29:18.298
They're getting cedar planks
for the bluefish.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.758
-Yeah.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.176
-Hey.
-Race you.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.844
Hey! Not fair.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.933
-Goal!
-Stop.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.060
-Wrong football, dork.

29:32.479 --> 29:36.858
Sand! Out, out. Sand in the house.
Sand. Sand. Shit.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.569
-Ow, ow, ow!

29:39.652 --> 29:41.654
<i>I never appreciated the bathrooms,</i>

29:46.117 --> 29:48.787
<i>the thick towels,</i>
<i>the water pressure, a view.</i>

29:49.245 --> 29:52.749
Larry? Larry, we forgot corn.
I need you to run to town.

29:57.378 --> 30:00.423
<i>You could pee and watch the ocean.</i>
<i>That was special.</i>

30:01.341 --> 30:04.010
<i>Now, this is my life. Don't get me wrong,</i>

30:04.093 --> 30:07.388
<i>I'm still grateful to be out and free</i>
<i>and walking in the sunshine,</i>

30:07.472 --> 30:09.641
<i>but I am still paying my debt.</i>

30:09.724 --> 30:12.727
You got strong thighs.
You do a lot of wall balls?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.395
Wall balls?

30:14.729 --> 30:17.899
Yeah, it's when you take the heavy ball
and you throw it up against the wall,

30:17.982 --> 30:20.819
and then you squat as you catch it
and then you throw it up again.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.946
You just keep doin' that
until your legs are on fire.

30:23.029 --> 30:23.905
It's a CrossFit thing.

30:24.656 --> 30:28.243
Wow. CrossFit? I'm impressed.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.038
Oh, no. Uh-uh. I don't do that no more.
I broke both my shins.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.458
You never get used to that warmth.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.837
So how's the job goin'?

30:39.420 --> 30:42.173
-Oh, fine. Good.
-Okay.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.217
Tips could be better.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.720
Think if I could pick up a dinner shift,
they would improve.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.848
So you can't pick up any dinner shifts?

30:50.515 --> 30:53.893
Curfew is 11:00.
Dinner shifts go till 1:00 a.m.

30:53.977 --> 30:57.230
Yeah, I guess you can't pick up
any dinner shifts.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.108
I got offered a job
at a better restaurant,

31:01.776 --> 31:02.944
but they serve alcohol.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.405
-Oh, yeah, that's not allowed.
-I'm aware.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.700
So I'm just gonna write down
that it's going okay.

31:10.952 --> 31:11.911
You got a check for me?

31:12.662 --> 31:14.539
I didn't realize that early release

31:14.622 --> 31:18.293
meant I was responsible for all
of my monitoring and testing fees.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.754
You know, it makes it really hard
for people to get back on their feet.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.965
You got a check for me?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.760
Is it okay if I pay double next week?

31:28.845 --> 31:32.056
I haven't got my latest paycheck,
and the money I do have,

31:32.140 --> 31:34.767
I really need for a bus
so that I can go visit--

31:34.851 --> 31:39.397
Yeah. Please do not make me regret
approving that inmate visit, okay?

31:39.480 --> 31:42.984
You pay now or you gonna be in violation
of your probation.

31:47.697 --> 31:51.075
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Money order or cashier's check only.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.368
Oh.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.330
Listen, I'll let you do it online, okay?

31:58.917 --> 31:59.751
There you go.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.176
-Yeah.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.722
I know. I know. You don't make the rules.
And I'm not gonna make my rent.

32:13.306 --> 32:16.017
You live in a spare bedroom
in Jackson Heights.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.894
How much could that possibly put you out?

32:18.603 --> 32:22.273
Upwards of $62 a night, apparently.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.283
Can I help you?

32:32.909 --> 32:35.536
As a matter fact, you can. And you will.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.498
You're gonna handle my burrito.

32:38.581 --> 32:42.085
Oh, come on, Hellman.
You know I'm tacos only.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.503
Well, Murphy's locked in a box.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.588
Unless you wanna end up with her
down in the SHU,

32:45.672 --> 32:47.507
you'll sell the load
she was supposed to sell for me.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.844
Why not Zirconia or Eckelcamp?
Those are her people.

32:51.928 --> 32:52.804
I'm not even in the business.

32:52.887 --> 32:54.347
You think I'm gonna trust those dopes?

32:55.890 --> 32:58.226
Carol trusted you. And say what you will
about the dead bitch,

32:58.309 --> 32:59.894
she had a good nose for people.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.189
So until Badison comes back,
you will sell my load.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.150
Please stop saying "load."

33:18.746 --> 33:21.040
I'm expecting $1,500 for the wad.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.906
Does that guy who juggles axes
still live across from here?

33:54.824 --> 33:56.617
He moved about a year ago.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.370
Someone with a lot of plants
lives there now.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.538
Do you remember when--

34:00.621 --> 34:05.418
Piper, I gotta jump on a conference call
in a few minutes. So, uh, sorry.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.131
Dad, do you think
you could look at me for a sec?

34:16.220 --> 34:18.056
Look, I know I've disappointed you.

34:19.432 --> 34:22.769
And I know that you don't approve
of most of my life choices.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.313
And frankly...

34:28.524 --> 34:30.693
Frankly, I'm not a fan
of most of them either.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.028
I mean, not all.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.949
Not all, but most.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.537
And I'm trying to get back on my feet.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.249
And I'm struggling. And I need some help.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.128
Well, at this point in your life, Piper,

34:50.129 --> 34:52.715
you know, the best way I can help you
is by letting you be an adult.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.259
Figure out things for yourself.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.847
Maybe if we did that in the first place,
you wouldn't be in this situation.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.602
Your mother always said I spoiled you.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.199
Could you at least lend me $50?

35:20.701 --> 35:21.702
For what

35:29.127 --> 35:31.087
Get it from Isabel on the way out.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.715
I expect to get paid back.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.636
Thank you.

36:10.334 --> 36:14.088
You're a new face around here.
What can I do you for?

36:15.464 --> 36:17.758
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.468
Are you now?

36:20.219 --> 36:21.888
I've recently come into an inheritance

36:21.971 --> 36:25.391
and I'd really like to unload it
and not step on any toes.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.186
-About 20 grams.

36:28.269 --> 36:32.523
Whoa, big time. Must've been
quite a relative you inherited from.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.401
Yeah, it was a rich uncle.

36:36.861 --> 36:37.820
I'll give you $1,300.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.364
I know you're gonna move it
for at least two.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.535
Give me 15 and we got a deal.
I gotta get at least 15.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.703
You gotta?

36:46.287 --> 36:50.041
If I don't, the dead might rise
from the grave and kill me in my sleep.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.006
What's this?

36:57.089 --> 36:59.634
You gotta to put half
in my Green Dot account first.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.344
Look at you, professional over here.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.431
How do I know
you won't run away with my money?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.559
Not too many places
to run around here.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.353
Hmm.

37:11.103 --> 37:13.606
I'll do it tonight.
Bring your stuff tomorrow.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.775
Now we can actually shake hands.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.529
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.742
Strictly business?

37:25.326 --> 37:28.412
It's all business, babe.
You're my heart.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.707
Don't you know that?
You gotta stop worryin'.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.504
I know. I-- I overreacted.

37:37.129 --> 37:40.174
I've had some time to cool down
and I even brought you a present.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.220
This an Adeola special?

37:44.303 --> 37:46.013
Yeah, I know how much you like it.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.058
It's my favorite. After you. I know, I know. I'm late.
But I brought pizza.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.000
What's going on here?

38:14.917 --> 38:15.751
It's a family dinner.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.296
Then why the fuck didn't you tell me
not to pick up the pizza?

38:18.379 --> 38:20.881
-Honey, I texted you six times.
-Oh.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.804
I was busy doing stuff.
Stuff for the family.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.347
This is so good.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.891
Oh, yeah? That's great.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.520
-Christina got a job today.
-Oh. I'm gonna work at the Old Navy part-time.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.107
It's Old Navy.

38:38.899 --> 38:39.775
That's what I said.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.154
You said "the Old Navy."
It's just "Old Navy."

38:43.237 --> 38:44.947
The Gap, Old Navy.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.908
-Shut the fuck up.
-You shut the fuck up, you dumb <i>puta.</i>

38:48.659 --> 38:49.618
Look who's talking.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.746
Oh, and what is that supposed to mean?

38:51.829 --> 38:54.498
That she's fucking Angel Ocasio.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.709
She is 13 years old.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.253
What's it your business? You ain't my dad.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.464
You're such a fucking bitch.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.602
Oh, shit! Help!

39:17.021 --> 39:19.315
She had some hooch
and she was, like, bugging out.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.650
Seriously, go in there.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.576
Everybody, back to your bunks. Now.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.037
We got a 10-54, D-Block.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.206
Please send medical and backup right away.

39:35.289 --> 39:38.709
I said in your bunks! Now! Lock down!

39:41.379 --> 39:42.380
Okay, okay.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.017
Mmm.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.071
I still got my period.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.657
It's been a long one.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.701
Yeah, well, I'm getting older.
Don't remind me.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.832
We could put a towel down.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.876
And fuck up all our new towels?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.754
Oh, come on, my love.
We should be celebratin'.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.256
I mean, we did it.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.758
We got your kids back. New place.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.970
We could even stop now if we wanted to.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.764
-Kinda.

40:34.723 --> 40:38.352
We've been so lucky so far.
Why not quit while we're ahead?

40:38.436 --> 40:41.689
And what the fuck am I supposed to do
with all that shit I got in my trunk, huh?

40:41.772 --> 40:42.648
Answer me that.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.240
Come on, baby. One more round

40:51.740 --> 40:54.201
Can't have all that inventory around,

40:54.702 --> 40:57.496
especially with the kids nearby
and everything. Hmm?

41:04.628 --> 41:05.754
Guess one more round.

41:14.263 --> 41:15.097
Shit. Just...

41:16.140 --> 41:18.517
It's work. Just give me one second.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.103
Hello?

41:22.855 --> 41:23.939
What?

41:25.274 --> 41:30.613
Oh, shit. Okay. Yeah, I'm coming now.
I'm leaving now.

41:31.280 --> 41:34.074
Shit. It's an emergency, hon. I'm sorry.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.202
We're gonna have to pick up

41:36.285 --> 41:38.078
-where we left off.
-Uh-huh.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.080
-I'll be back.
-Mmm-hmm.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.999
I don't know when I'll be back.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.294
I love you.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.421
Okay.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.115
-Get out.
-I'm on lockdown.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.076
Get the fuck out. They're tossing cells.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.911
Where's the stash, huh?

42:20.120 --> 42:22.706
-It's a drug search. They've got the dogs. If there's dogs, they're gonna sniff me
and make me squat and cough.

42:26.043 --> 42:29.797
Hmm. No one said this was going up
your fuck crack. Okay? Open wide.

42:29.880 --> 42:30.714
-Fuck no.
-Yeah.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.216
I am not your <i>Maria Full of Grace.</i>

42:32.299 --> 42:34.718
I know what happens if that opens up
in my stomach. I die!

42:34.802 --> 42:37.513
A lot of shit in prison
can kill you, right?

42:37.596 --> 42:39.431
-Come on.

42:39.807 --> 42:40.766
Come on. Come on.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.644
There we go.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.290
Doin' okay, inmate? You look kind of pale.

43:05.499 --> 43:08.002
I'm always pale. I'm a winter.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.962
Bingo in 206!

43:15.634 --> 43:16.927
I think I'm a autumn.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.599
112 is hot.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.142
So is 113.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.435
Shit.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.562
It's like heroin Christmas in here.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.109
You feeling okay, sir?

43:32.192 --> 43:35.112
I just saw an inmate as pale as you are.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.197
Might be a stomach bug goin' around.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.241
Yeah.

43:39.325 --> 43:41.827
Yeah, I... I might have a bug.

44:04.141 --> 44:05.517
What the fuck happened?

44:05.601 --> 44:07.144
Since when did Daddy start usin'?

44:07.519 --> 44:08.687
What are you talking about?

44:09.271 --> 44:11.732
They found a shit ton of drugs
in the sweep, okay?

44:11.815 --> 44:13.275
This could all lead back to us.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.611
God. Listen. Just relax.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.405
I'll talk to Daddy. I'll make sure
she keeps her shit together.

44:20.074 --> 44:20.991
What?

44:23.452 --> 44:24.620
Daddy's dead.

44:25.412 --> 44:27.373
No. No, she's just fucked up.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.333
She's dead, all right?

44:29.416 --> 44:33.504
And so are you if any of this comes back
to bite us in the ass.

God damn it!

45:24.722 --> 45:26.807
I'm so sorry.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.768
Why are you whispering now?

46:19.485 --> 46:21.028
I am so sorry about this morning.

46:21.111 --> 46:22.613
Your work just called me.

46:22.696 --> 46:25.115
Woke up the baby again.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.743
I don't understand why you gave them
my cell phone number.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.245
I didn't have a phone
when I got the job. I'm sorry.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.789
I'll fix it as soon as I'm home.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.625
It doesn't matter.
They called to say they're letting you go.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.585
<i>-Yeah.</i>

46:36.668 --> 46:38.212
<i>They want you to know</i>
<i>that they like you a lot,</i>

46:38.295 --> 46:40.506
but they need someone
with a more dependable schedule.

46:41.089 --> 46:43.217
What about the dishwasher's pickleball?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.552
<i>-Never mind.</i>

46:45.886 --> 46:47.054
This is really bad.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.306
<i>I'm gonna go back to sleep now.</i>

46:49.389 --> 46:51.058
Sorry about your job, Pipes.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.352
We'll give you a grace week on the rent.

46:53.435 --> 46:54.436
-No!
-But seriously,

46:54.520 --> 46:57.189
<i>you should really talk to Dad</i>
<i>about maybe helping you out.</i>

47:03.821 --> 47:05.739
It's okay, baby.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.157
Don't cry.

47:10.369 --> 47:11.370
What do you want?

47:11.954 --> 47:14.540
I'm here to see Daddy.
We talked about it yesterday.

47:15.123 --> 47:16.291
What?

47:16.708 --> 47:17.751
Daddy's dead.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.629
-Hi. Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.965
I mean, we only have
nine minutes now, but it's fine.

48:05.048 --> 48:06.633
Somebody's grumpy.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.803
Sorry. I had, like, the day from hell.

48:09.887 --> 48:10.971
Jinx. So did I.

48:12.931 --> 48:13.932
What happened?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.562
Let's just be together.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.232
I like that.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.485
Mmm.

48:54.556 --> 48:56.934
I can't believe
I'm finally seeing your face.

48:58.393 --> 49:00.646
It is good to see you.

49:08.236 --> 49:09.404
How was your drive up?

49:10.405 --> 49:11.490
It was fine.

49:12.908 --> 49:13.909
Worth it. But how are you doing?

49:18.747 --> 49:20.457
I feel fine. Everything's fine.

49:22.584 --> 49:24.086
It's a cute dress, by the way.

49:24.503 --> 49:25.837
You going to a party later?

49:25.921 --> 49:28.507
No. No, I wore it for you.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.802
I wanted to look nice.
Besides, what party would I--

49:31.885 --> 49:32.928
I was joking.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.764
Right. Of course. I knew that.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.769
How's the job going?

49:41.436 --> 49:42.938
Thick Thais treating you right?

49:43.021 --> 49:45.357
-Oh, Thunder Thais.
-Oh, right.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.567
It's good. It's fine.

49:48.819 --> 49:50.362
-Free noodles.
-Hmm.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.947
But I wanna hear about you.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.490
How are you doing? There's nothing to tell.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.035
You know this place.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.959
Actually, there is one thing.

50:04.543 --> 50:07.879
You're never gonna believe
what Nicky showed me on her phone.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.382
What are you doing
with a phone?

50:10.966 --> 50:11.925
It's Nicky's.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.302
You promised me that
you were gonna be playing it safe.

50:17.305 --> 50:20.017
I won't ever look at another
woman's phone again.

50:21.852 --> 50:22.894
Scout's honor.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.106
I'm sorry. I...

50:30.944 --> 50:32.029
What was on the phone?

50:33.989 --> 50:36.158
It's stupid. It doesn't matter.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.870
<i>Why can't we talk?</i>

50:41.246 --> 50:42.789
<i>This doesn't feel good.</i>

50:43.498 --> 50:45.917
<i>She reminds me of my sister.</i>
<i>Fucking bitch.</i>

50:46.001 --> 50:47.544
<i>Maybe I should stab her, too?</i>

50:47.627 --> 50:49.504
<i>Oh, I'm about to beat these fools.</i>

50:50.088 --> 50:51.006
<i>What day is it?</i>

50:52.299 --> 50:55.093
<i>Why are you so crazy? Stop being crazy.</i>

50:55.719 --> 50:56.970
<i>Tomorrow I'll do it.</i>

50:57.054 --> 50:58.889
<i>That bitch is nasty.</i>

50:59.222 --> 51:00.849
<i>I wonder if she killed someone.</i>

51:01.975 --> 51:02.976
<i>She hates me.</i>

51:03.810 --> 51:05.437
<i>Did I shower this week?</i>

51:05.812 --> 51:07.939
<i>I'm so tired of the same conversation.</i>

51:08.356 --> 51:09.941
<i>I'll exercise tomorrow.</i>

51:10.525 --> 51:12.069
<i>I'm gonna go crazy in here.</i>

51:12.444 --> 51:13.820
<i>I shouldn't have said that.</i>

51:14.905 --> 51:17.491
<i>Shit. Forgot my mom's birthday again.</i>

51:17.574 --> 51:18.992
<i>This is my life now.</i>

51:19.659 --> 51:20.994
<i>Is it sweater weather yet?</i>

51:21.078 --> 51:22.496
<i>I should've been a dancer.</i>

51:22.579 --> 51:23.872
<i>Her breath reeks.</i>

51:23.955 --> 51:25.415
<i>Fuck a Jennifer Lawrence.</i>

51:25.499 --> 51:26.750
<i>She likes me.</i>

51:26.833 --> 51:28.710
<i>These bitches need to shut the fuck up.</i>

51:28.794 --> 51:29.878
<i>Dank ass.</i>

51:29.961 --> 51:32.631
<i>Life goal 12. Write an...</i>

51:32.714 --> 51:33.757
<i>I miss my man.</i>

51:33.840 --> 51:35.467
<i>I can do this.</i>

51:35.550 --> 51:36.384
<i>You know exactly...</i>

51:36.468 --> 51:37.344
<i>These lights!</i>

51:37.427 --> 51:38.887
<i>Is that her real voice?</i>

51:38.970 --> 51:41.264
Party of Five. <i>That's the show</i>
<i>I was trying to come up with.</i>

51:41.348 --> 51:42.474
<i>She's such a liar.</i>

51:42.557 --> 51:44.518
<i>Her nose is so weird...</i>

51:49.981 --> 51:51.274
<i>I wonder if she killed someone.</i> <i>Where's she think she going?</i>

52:40.782 --> 52:42.242
What did she say?

52:42.325 --> 52:44.411
She says it's all different now.
