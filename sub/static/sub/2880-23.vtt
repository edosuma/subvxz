WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.104
Almost there.
You're doing great.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.872
(strained):
Thanks for lifting my spirits.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.774
Next time, try lifting the box.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.577
Please hurry.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.179
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I don't need
a treadmill!

00:13.181 --> 00:15.881
The doctor says
you need to get exercise!

00:15.883 --> 00:18.083
I get plenty
of exercise!

00:18.085 --> 00:21.887
Crushing my will to live
isn't exercise!

00:21.889 --> 00:25.324
If she isn't gonna use it,
then why are we doing this?

00:25.326 --> 00:27.493
She'll use it.
All I need is to rig it

00:27.495 --> 00:30.663
with a fishing pole
and a HoneyBaked Ham.

00:30.665 --> 00:31.897
All right.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.032
Now what?

00:33.034 --> 00:35.167
We set it up
in Howie's old room.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.202
Do you know how to set it up?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.237
Please,
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.738
I think I can handle...

00:39.740 --> 00:41.140
Ma, look out!

00:41.142 --> 00:43.709
(Mrs. Wolowitz screams)

00:43.711 --> 00:47.880
I told you this
thing would kill me!

01:17.109 --> 01:21.278
So she's gonna be laid up
for at least six weeks.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.680
Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.281
Should we do something
for her?

01:24.283 --> 01:27.852
I know. Let's go see
the new Spider-Man movie.

01:28.954 --> 01:31.522
Sheldon, we're talking
about your friend's mother.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.590
She got hurt.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.692
I thought that subject
had run its course,

01:34.694 --> 01:36.327
so I changed it.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.830
It's called reading
the room, Amy.

01:39.832 --> 01:41.399
Hi.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.633
Hey, how were things on the set?

01:42.635 --> 01:44.035
Uh, pretty good, actually.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.836
So the movie's not
as bad as you thought?

01:45.838 --> 01:47.304
Oh, no, it is,

01:47.306 --> 01:48.873
but I decided,
instead of complaining about it,

01:48.875 --> 01:51.175
I'm just gonna go in every day
and give it my all.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.410
Good for you.
Thanks.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.078
There's no reason why
I shouldn't be

01:54.080 --> 01:56.681
the best bisexual go-go dancer
slowly transforming

01:56.683 --> 02:00.084
into a killer gorilla
anyone's ever seen.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.719
I don't know.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.255
The bisexual gorilla
go-go dancer in <i>Schindler's List</i>

02:04.257 --> 02:05.589
is tough to beat.

02:05.591 --> 02:07.558
Ah, very good.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.761
Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

02:10.763 --> 02:13.497
would be out of place in a film
about the Holocaust.

02:13.499 --> 02:17.134
It only gets funnier
when you explain it, Sheldon.

02:17.136 --> 02:20.171
(chuckling):
I know.

02:23.008 --> 02:26.510
(sighs) Okay, she's all settled
in the guest room.

02:26.512 --> 02:28.245
Maybe we should get
one of those machines

02:28.247 --> 02:30.114
to help her up the stairs.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.016
You mean a forklift?

02:32.784 --> 02:34.785
Howie...
I'm sorry.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.954
I just can't deal
with this right now.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.023
Taking care of your own mother?
How can you say that?

02:39.025 --> 02:41.892
Bernie, she's gonna be off
her feet for six to eight weeks.

02:41.894 --> 02:44.061
Are you prepared
to feed her, wash her

02:44.063 --> 02:45.863
and take her to the toilet?

02:45.865 --> 02:48.566
I would do it for my mother.
Yeah, of course

02:48.568 --> 02:51.068
you would--
you're a loving person.

02:51.070 --> 02:55.706
I'm what my people
would call a <i>putz.</i>

02:55.708 --> 02:58.209
Look, I'm not crazy
about the idea,

02:58.211 --> 03:00.111
but what other
choice do we have?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.145
We get a nurse.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.013
Preferably someone
from a Third World country

03:03.015 --> 03:06.650
who's used to suffering
and unpleasant smells.

03:08.053 --> 03:09.487
You'd hire a
total stranger

03:09.489 --> 03:11.856
to take care of the
woman who raised you?

03:11.858 --> 03:12.957
That's so cruel.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.359
Not if we pay them well

03:15.361 --> 03:18.395
and let them listen
to the music of their homeland.

03:20.098 --> 03:22.500
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I need to tinkle!

03:22.502 --> 03:25.102
Sounds like a job
for a loving person.

03:26.872 --> 03:28.472
Would you like me
to play some Polish music

03:28.474 --> 03:29.974
while you carry her
to the toilet?

03:31.476 --> 03:33.244
You are a <i>putz.</i>

03:34.546 --> 03:36.914
As advertised.

03:40.886 --> 03:42.119
Thanks for coming
with me.

03:42.121 --> 03:45.156
Thanks for inviting me
after everyone else said no.

03:47.092 --> 03:48.859
Aren't you gonna get
3-D glasses?

03:48.861 --> 03:50.528
I brought my own.

03:50.530 --> 03:54.865
No sense in risking
bridge-of-nose herpes.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.001
Is that a real thing?

03:57.003 --> 03:59.837
Well, until they invent
nose condoms,

03:59.839 --> 04:02.006
I'm not finding out.

04:04.009 --> 04:06.110
Emily! Hey!

04:06.112 --> 04:07.578
Oh, hey, Raj.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.046
Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.481
Sheldon, this is Emily.

04:11.283 --> 04:13.384
Oh, yes, you're
the dermatologist.

04:13.386 --> 04:17.188
I went for a walk yesterday
without sunscreen.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.991
Do you see anything
on my forehead

04:20.993 --> 04:23.994
that I should be
concerned about?

04:23.996 --> 04:27.064
Um, you know what?
I better go.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.332
My movie's about
to start.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.600
Are you here alone?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.601
No, not really.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.136
What do you mean,
"not really"?

04:32.138 --> 04:33.437
Hey, should we get
our seats?

04:33.439 --> 04:34.872
Yeah.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.174
It was nice seeing you.
Um, I'll call you later.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.342
Yeah, okay.

04:41.079 --> 04:43.848
That was awkward, right?

04:45.584 --> 04:46.984
Uh-huh.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.385
Is it because
she's dating you

04:48.387 --> 04:49.841
but was out with
that other fellow?

04:49.866 --> 04:50.755
Yes.

04:50.756 --> 04:53.324
Good. I thought she saw
something on my forehead.

04:56.428 --> 04:58.562
And... action.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.698
Please don't shut me out.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.665
Go away.

05:01.667 --> 05:04.668
Just go away.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.872
I swear, I will find a way
to turn you back.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.240
What gave you
the right

05:09.242 --> 05:12.943
to mix my DNA with that
of a killer gorilla?

05:14.079 --> 05:16.513
I was trying
to save your life.

05:16.515 --> 05:19.049
Life? What life?
Look at me! I'm a monster!

05:19.051 --> 05:22.519
And now I have blood on my
hands, or paws. I don't know.

05:26.124 --> 05:29.627
You can't give up.
I love you.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.597
I love you, too.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.400
But I'm afraid
I love killing more.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.270
Like, one day, I might
actually try and kill you!

05:39.272 --> 05:41.939
(shrieking)

05:41.941 --> 05:45.075
And... cut.
All right.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.580
All right, let's set up
for the next scene.

05:49.582 --> 05:53.117
Actually, you know what?
Can we do one more?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.184
I think I could do it better.

05:54.186 --> 05:56.353
Let's just move on.
No one cares.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.888
Well, (scoffs) I care.
I mean, look,

05:57.890 --> 06:00.157
if we're gonna do this,
why not try and make it

06:00.159 --> 06:01.492
something
we're actually proud of?

06:01.494 --> 06:03.627
(clears throat)

06:04.763 --> 06:05.729
Look, sweetie,

06:05.731 --> 06:06.964
this movie is garbage,

06:06.966 --> 06:08.499
but you should be happy
about that,

06:08.501 --> 06:11.468
'cause if it was a good movie,
you wouldn't be in it.

06:12.971 --> 06:13.971
Whoa, whoa, hang on.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.272
There's no need
to insult her.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.040
And who are you?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.174
I'm her boyfriend.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.375
Isn't she too hot for you?

06:18.377 --> 06:20.644
A little, yeah.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.579
Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

06:22.581 --> 06:24.181
You can't do that.
He's with me.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.650
You know what? You can get off
my set, too. You're fired.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.585
What? You can't fire me.
I'm the star.

06:28.587 --> 06:32.156
I'm the girl that goes bananas.
It says so on the poster.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.925
Yeah, but we just shot the last
scene where we see your face.

06:34.927 --> 06:40.264
So from now own, the star of
the movie is whoever wears this.

06:41.366 --> 06:43.267
Hey, if you're
gonna fire her,

06:43.269 --> 06:45.169
then you have to
fire me, too.

06:45.171 --> 06:49.273
Wow, that fell apart
really fast.

06:57.774 --> 06:59.608
Thanks for skipping
the movie.

06:59.610 --> 07:01.943
I couldn't sit in that theater
for two hours

07:01.945 --> 07:03.845
wondering about Emily
and that guy.

07:03.847 --> 07:05.647
Oh, quite all right.

07:05.649 --> 07:07.482
After my forehead
melanoma scare,

07:07.484 --> 07:09.651
I've learned not to sweat
the small stuff.

07:12.255 --> 07:13.655
Well, sorry,

07:13.657 --> 07:16.291
I don't have all the ingredients
to make chai tea.

07:16.293 --> 07:17.726
You don't have
to make me anything.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.162
No, I do.
You're upset about Emily

07:20.164 --> 07:21.096
and you're Indian.

07:21.098 --> 07:22.964
I need to make you
chai tea.

07:22.966 --> 07:28.703
Now, I have all the ingredients
except cardamom seeds.

07:28.705 --> 07:31.306
Do you happen
to have any on you?

07:31.308 --> 07:34.576
Sorry, I left them in my turban.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.681
Oh, I'll make
English breakfast tea.

07:39.683 --> 07:41.083
They destroyed
your culture.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.617
That's close enough.

07:45.755 --> 07:47.956
You know, I'm curious,

07:47.958 --> 07:51.626
why are you so upset about
seeing Emily with another man?

07:51.628 --> 07:54.796
Wouldn't you be upset if you saw
Amy out with someone else?

07:54.798 --> 07:55.964
Can't happen.

07:55.966 --> 07:58.166
We have an ironclad
relationship agreement

07:58.168 --> 08:00.469
which precludes her
from physical contact

08:00.471 --> 08:02.904
with anyone other than me.

08:02.906 --> 08:05.507
But you don't have sex
with her, either.

08:05.509 --> 08:08.043
(chuckles) Slick, huh?

08:08.045 --> 08:11.313
To be truthful, Emily and I
haven't dated that long,

08:11.315 --> 08:13.815
and we never agreed to be
exclusive to each other.

08:13.817 --> 08:15.250
Have you had intercourse?

08:15.252 --> 08:16.384
No.

08:16.386 --> 08:17.686
Well, stick to your guns.

08:17.688 --> 08:19.321
There will be a lot of pressure.

08:25.161 --> 08:27.562
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I'm hungry again!

08:29.665 --> 08:32.833
It's like the world's
fattest cuckoo clock.

08:36.772 --> 08:38.472
You know, you're
always talking about

08:38.475 --> 08:39.573
having a baby someday.

08:39.576 --> 08:41.610
This is exactly what
it's gonna be like.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.111
No, it's not.

08:43.113 --> 08:46.314
Come on. The constant
fussing, eating, pooping,

08:46.316 --> 08:47.315
burping, drooling.

08:47.317 --> 08:48.984
We're even waiting
for the day

08:48.986 --> 08:51.286
when she can finally
walk on her own.

08:52.421 --> 08:53.655
Maybe you're right.

08:53.657 --> 08:56.892
Anything she finds on the floor
goes right in her mouth.

09:01.931 --> 09:04.432
I'm just telling you now,
if we do have kids,

09:04.434 --> 09:06.635
don't expect me
to do all the work.

09:06.637 --> 09:09.504
Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

09:09.506 --> 09:12.574
I'd be excellent
at taking care of a baby.

09:12.576 --> 09:15.010
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I'm still hungry!

09:15.012 --> 09:16.945
I'm coming, you big baby!

09:20.917 --> 09:23.685
You know, the only thing worse
than doing a movie

09:23.687 --> 09:26.721
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass

09:26.723 --> 09:28.089
is getting fired from a movie

09:28.091 --> 09:30.692
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass.

09:31.694 --> 09:34.362
Forget it, man,
it's crap.

09:34.364 --> 09:36.031
You just move on
to the next thing.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.766
Yeah, well, it's easy
for you to say.

09:37.768 --> 09:39.801
You used to be famous.

09:39.803 --> 09:42.871
Hey. I just lost
a job for you.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.707
You're right, I'm sorry,
you're famous.

09:45.709 --> 09:47.909
Penny, it's not
about being famous.

09:47.911 --> 09:49.945
It's about the art.

09:49.947 --> 09:51.980
It's about the passion
we have for our craft.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.915
(phone dings)

09:53.917 --> 09:56.218
I have an audition
for <i>Sharknado 2!</i>

09:56.220 --> 09:58.053
If I book this,
I am totally gonna

09:58.055 --> 09:59.588
pay you back
for this beer.

10:02.725 --> 10:06.328
God, what am I
doing with my life?

10:06.330 --> 10:08.063
You having second thoughts
about acting?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.998
You were on set, you
saw what it was like.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.367
Yeah, but it's not
always that bad.

10:12.369 --> 10:13.501
Oh, really?

10:13.503 --> 10:15.136
What about when you did, uh,

10:15.138 --> 10:16.871
Anne Frank at that
cute little theater?

10:16.873 --> 10:19.307
It was over a bowling alley.

10:20.409 --> 10:22.210
Yeah, but...

10:22.212 --> 10:25.780
there was ample parking.

10:25.782 --> 10:27.048
Are you done?

10:27.050 --> 10:29.150
And you were so good
in the TV commercial.

10:29.152 --> 10:32.153
It was for hemorrhoid cream.

10:32.155 --> 10:34.189
And I got itchy and swollen

10:34.191 --> 10:36.324
just watching you.

10:39.528 --> 10:41.663
Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.

10:41.665 --> 10:42.797
Come on.

10:42.799 --> 10:44.733
How can you be sad
when you're going home

10:44.735 --> 10:47.502
with all five-foot-six of this?

10:47.504 --> 10:50.572
Hmm. You think you're
five-foot-six, that's funny.

10:53.909 --> 10:55.877
I don't understand it.

10:55.879 --> 10:56.911
I'm a nice guy,

10:56.913 --> 10:58.446
I have a great job,

10:58.448 --> 10:59.648
I'm well-educated,

10:59.650 --> 11:01.516
come from a good family...

11:01.518 --> 11:03.585
Why don't women
want to be with me?

11:03.587 --> 11:04.519
(sighs)

11:04.521 --> 11:06.788
An interesting
question.

11:08.190 --> 11:09.624
Well...

11:09.626 --> 11:11.760
good night.

11:11.762 --> 11:13.228
What?

11:13.230 --> 11:14.529
Don't send me home.

11:14.531 --> 11:15.930
I can't be alone
right now.

11:15.932 --> 11:17.799
That's your problem.

11:17.801 --> 11:19.000
You can't be alone.

11:19.002 --> 11:20.602
What do you mean?

11:22.605 --> 11:25.040
How many women have
you had dates with?

11:26.475 --> 11:27.442
Eleven.

11:27.444 --> 11:29.344
How many of
those women

11:29.346 --> 11:31.880
did you think would become
your perfect companion?

11:33.015 --> 11:34.182
Eleven.

11:35.251 --> 11:36.284
Wait.

11:36.286 --> 11:38.219
Do I count the 200-pound
Sailor Moon girl

11:38.221 --> 11:41.022
that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic Con?

11:43.959 --> 11:45.694
Sure.

11:46.529 --> 11:47.662
I'll stick with 11.

11:47.664 --> 11:50.031
She liked Howard better.

11:51.901 --> 11:54.235
Well, now do you
see the problem?

11:55.504 --> 11:56.771
Maybe.

11:56.773 --> 11:58.406
I... I don't know.

11:58.408 --> 11:59.641
You... It's late,
I-I should...

11:59.643 --> 12:01.843
I should go.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.413
(sighs)

12:05.415 --> 12:06.381
Look,

12:06.383 --> 12:08.183
I-I do get what you're saying.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.317
Instead of desperately clinging

12:09.319 --> 12:11.186
to any woman
who will go out with me,

12:11.188 --> 12:13.788
I need to work on
my fear of being alone.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.592
I was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...

12:19.829 --> 12:21.096
...it's my bedtime,

12:21.098 --> 12:22.464
so whatever gets you
out the door.

12:22.466 --> 12:24.666
Good night.

12:27.636 --> 12:29.738
Howie, I'm back!

12:29.740 --> 12:32.073
Shh-shh-shh,
I just got her to sleep.

12:32.075 --> 12:33.341
Sorry.

12:33.343 --> 12:34.409
What took you so long?

12:34.411 --> 12:36.010
The grocery store
is a few blocks away.

12:36.012 --> 12:37.345
They only had
regular yogurt.

12:37.347 --> 12:39.114
I had to go to
a different store

12:39.116 --> 12:41.316
to get the extra-fat
kind your mom likes.

12:42.218 --> 12:44.352
Then why do I smell coffee
on your breath?

12:44.354 --> 12:45.553
So what?

12:45.555 --> 12:47.155
After two days of
taking care of her,

12:47.157 --> 12:49.057
excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.325
A mocha?

12:50.327 --> 12:53.194
Well, it must be nice
to be queen.

12:53.196 --> 12:54.696
Queen?

12:54.698 --> 12:56.664
I've been killing
myself here!

12:56.666 --> 12:57.732
Well, whose fault is that?

12:57.734 --> 12:59.401
I wanted to get a nurse,
but you were all,

12:59.403 --> 13:01.923
(high-pitched voice): "I'm nice.
I want to take care of people."

13:03.706 --> 13:05.440
I'm glad I got that mocha.

13:05.442 --> 13:07.242
And you know what
else I'm glad about?

13:07.244 --> 13:11.446
I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!

13:13.949 --> 13:15.850
MRS. WOLOWITZ (moaning):
Howard!

13:15.852 --> 13:17.385
Thanks a lot.

13:17.387 --> 13:19.487
Now I have to go
rub her belly again.

13:23.225 --> 13:25.427
(knocking at door)

13:27.530 --> 13:28.563
Hey.

13:28.565 --> 13:30.198
Thanks for letting me come over.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.433
Of course.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.601
Please, come in.

13:34.937 --> 13:36.171
I just wanted to say

13:36.173 --> 13:38.773
how sorry I am about tonight,
and...

13:38.775 --> 13:40.742
I want to make sure
that we're okay.

13:40.744 --> 13:42.911
Uh, look, you and I haven't made

13:42.913 --> 13:44.813
any commitments to each other.
I know.

13:44.815 --> 13:46.915
I just felt like
I needed to explain.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.817
The guy I was with
did my last tattoo,

13:48.819 --> 13:50.251
and he's been asking
me out for months.

13:50.253 --> 13:52.720
I finally said yes
just to get it over with.

13:52.722 --> 13:54.389
It's okay.

13:54.391 --> 13:55.690
Really?

13:55.692 --> 13:58.426
Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,

13:58.428 --> 14:01.029
but that's my issue, not yours.

14:01.031 --> 14:02.964
Wow.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.799
If I saw you out
with another woman,

14:04.801 --> 14:06.501
I'd be pretty upset.

14:06.503 --> 14:09.437
Thank you.

14:10.439 --> 14:11.773
Not just for being upset,

14:11.775 --> 14:14.042
but for believing
that could happen.

14:17.279 --> 14:19.948
Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

14:19.950 --> 14:22.116
Well, me, neither.

14:22.118 --> 14:23.218
Okay.

14:23.220 --> 14:25.220
Okay.
(laughs)

14:25.222 --> 14:26.721
Please.

14:26.723 --> 14:29.290
So, uh... you...
you have tattoos?

14:29.292 --> 14:30.258
Yeah.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.594
I don't.

14:32.596 --> 14:34.229
I have a hole
in my belly button

14:34.231 --> 14:37.265
that may or may not
have been a piercing.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.500
That's cool.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.568
It's a piercing.

14:41.804 --> 14:42.770
So, uh...

14:42.772 --> 14:44.138
how many tattoos?

14:44.140 --> 14:46.407
One on my shoulder,

14:46.409 --> 14:48.376
one not on my shoulder

14:48.378 --> 14:51.880
and one <i>really</i> not
on my shoulder.

14:53.349 --> 14:54.782
It's, uh...

14:54.784 --> 14:57.051
been a long time since
I've seen a girl's...

14:57.053 --> 14:58.953
really not her shoulder.

14:58.955 --> 15:00.288
(chuckles)

15:00.290 --> 15:03.124
Well...

15:03.126 --> 15:05.159
how about you show
me your piercing

15:05.161 --> 15:07.395
and I show you
my tattoos?

15:13.936 --> 15:15.603
But, uh, before
I take my shirt off,

15:15.605 --> 15:18.139
I just need like ten minutes
to do some crunches.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.381
Oh, my God.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.183
What a day.

15:29.185 --> 15:30.451
Can I get you anything?

15:30.453 --> 15:33.254
(sighs) No.

15:33.256 --> 15:35.924
I need to start making
some smart decisions.

15:35.926 --> 15:37.425
(exhales)
With your career?

15:37.427 --> 15:38.993
With my life.

15:38.995 --> 15:40.995
Like what?

15:40.997 --> 15:43.197
I don't know.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.000
We could get married.

15:46.002 --> 15:47.769
Come on, be serious.

15:47.771 --> 15:48.937
I am.

15:48.939 --> 15:50.538
Why?

15:50.540 --> 15:53.441
Because I'm
a-a "smart decision"?

15:53.443 --> 15:54.676
Well, yeah.

15:55.511 --> 15:58.046
So I'm like a bran muffin.

15:59.582 --> 16:00.682
What...

16:00.684 --> 16:01.816
No, that's not what I'm saying.

16:01.818 --> 16:03.084
No, it's exactly
what you're saying.

16:03.086 --> 16:04.619
I'm the boring thing
you're choosing

16:04.621 --> 16:06.054
because I'm good for you.

16:06.056 --> 16:07.155
What does it matter?

16:07.157 --> 16:08.489
The point is, I'm choosing you.

16:08.491 --> 16:09.524
Well, it matters a lot!

16:09.526 --> 16:11.092
I don't want to be
a bran muffin.

16:11.094 --> 16:12.660
I-I want to be

16:12.662 --> 16:15.196
a... Cinnabon, you know?

16:16.031 --> 16:18.566
A strawberry Pop-Tart.

16:19.468 --> 16:20.702
Something you're excited about

16:20.704 --> 16:23.304
even though it could
give you diabetes.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.708
Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.443
No, no. No, it's too late.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.478
I-I'm your
bran muffin.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.015
Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.

16:34.017 --> 16:35.116
You know what? Forget it.

16:35.118 --> 16:36.150
I never should've brought it up.

16:36.152 --> 16:38.853
You know I want to marry you,

16:38.855 --> 16:40.088
but you're
only doing this

16:40.090 --> 16:41.189
because you got fired

16:41.191 --> 16:42.390
and you're feeling
sorry for yourself.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.359
Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired

16:44.361 --> 16:46.260
from that movie was the best
thing that could have happened

16:46.262 --> 16:47.662
to me, okay?
I finally realize

16:47.664 --> 16:49.063
I don't need to be famous

16:49.065 --> 16:50.698
or have some big career
to be happy.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.833
Then what <i>do</i> you need?

16:51.835 --> 16:54.736
You, you stupid Pop-Tart!

16:59.708 --> 17:01.576
Oh.

17:02.745 --> 17:05.680
Then I guess I'm in.

17:06.548 --> 17:07.448
Really?

17:07.450 --> 17:08.782
You "guess you're in"?

17:10.185 --> 17:11.752
Not like, "I guess I'm in."

17:11.755 --> 17:14.422
Like "I guess... I'm in!"

17:15.723 --> 17:16.924
Okay.

17:16.925 --> 17:18.960
Cool.

17:22.330 --> 17:23.897
So is that it?

17:23.900 --> 17:25.133
Are... are we engaged?

17:26.101 --> 17:27.801
Yeah, I think so.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.105
All right.

17:33.242 --> 17:34.809
What's wrong?

17:34.811 --> 17:36.477
I'm not sure.

17:36.479 --> 17:40.148
Just... feels
a little anticlimactic.

17:41.483 --> 17:43.685
Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

17:44.953 --> 17:46.921
Oh, I know.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.892
This might help.

17:54.697 --> 17:56.998
Where did you get a ring?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.633
I've...

17:58.635 --> 18:00.835
had it for a couple years,
not important.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.742
Penny...

18:07.744 --> 18:09.277
will you marry me?

18:10.846 --> 18:12.480
Oh, my God, yes.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.182
(laughing)

18:14.950 --> 18:16.751
(sighs happily)

18:16.753 --> 18:18.419
This would have been
so much more romantic

18:18.421 --> 18:20.588
if you didn't have
monkey hair on your finger.

How you feeling?

18:35.403 --> 18:37.237
Last night was
a little rough,

18:37.239 --> 18:39.806
but I think we're
gonna get through this.

18:39.808 --> 18:41.107
I'm proud of us.

18:41.109 --> 18:42.976
Me, too.

18:42.978 --> 18:45.211
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Where's my pancakes?!

18:45.213 --> 18:47.780
(accent):
Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!

18:53.454 --> 18:54.554
You were right.
