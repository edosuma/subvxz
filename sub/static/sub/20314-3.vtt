00:03.917 --> 00:06.375
-Yeah, I'm not really sure
why we're doing this...

00:06.417 --> 00:10.083
But, ah, to me it feels like
a little bit of an invasion
of my privacy.

00:11.709 --> 00:13.625
-Hey, Jimmy, whatcha
doing after school today?

00:13.667 --> 00:16.792
-David, please, read quietly.
I have work to do.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.709
Okay? Turn around.

00:19.750 --> 00:24.125
-[Lori]: Sir, I have a question.
What is act utilitarianism?

00:24.166 --> 00:27.792
-[Gerry types on computer]
-Sir? Sir?

00:27.834 --> 00:30.166
-Oh, question? Sorry.

00:30.208 --> 00:32.375
-What is act utilitarianism?

00:32.417 --> 00:37.542
-Oh, ah...act utilitarianism?
Let me think. Ummm...

00:37.583 --> 00:42.625
Oh, that's the theory which
states that a person's act is
morally right.

00:42.667 --> 00:47.417
Ah, if it creates as much
happiness as possible under
the circumcisions.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.041
Circumstances!
Did I say circumcisions?

00:53.083 --> 00:55.333
Under the circumstances, okay?

00:55.375 --> 00:57.834
Any other questions?
Let me know.

00:57.875 --> 01:01.458
I might not know all the answers
but there's a good chance
I know a lot of them, okay?

the puzzle. Is it...

01:20.166 --> 01:22.667
Student elections this week?

01:29.083 --> 01:32.166
-As you know, the
digital media club

01:32.208 --> 01:35.834
documenting the school elections
as part of their class project.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.625
I've given them full
access to the school.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.166
And I want to thank you
all for agreeing to be filmed.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.375
-Yes, sir, I don't remember
agreeing to do this.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.542
-Special thank you to Ms. Mason.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.834
Her grade eight class is
studying the electoral process.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.000
And she's agreed to
have the class filmed.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.208
-I'm really excited
about it sir.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.417
-Okay, that's it.
Teach hard.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.583
Duncan, can I have a word?
-With me? For what?

02:00.458 --> 02:03.041
-I would like you to be the
teacher liaison for the

02:03.083 --> 02:05.959
student council this year.
-No, that's Lisa's job.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.250
-Her plate is full, there's
no one else available.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.500
-I got my plate full,
I'm coaching basketball.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.333
-It's not a big time commitment.
The student council does
most of the work.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.834
All you have to do is, be there,
guide them and answer a few
questions.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.792
I think it would be a good fit.
The students connect with you.

02:19.834 --> 02:22.834
-[Quietly]: Can you say
that to the camera?

02:22.875 --> 02:25.125
-Can you do it?
-Yes, I will do it
for the students.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.834
-Good.
-The greatest gift of all.

02:27.875 --> 02:31.208
Children are our future,
teach them well.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.875
Let...

02:33.917 --> 02:36.041
-[Students chattering]

02:36.083 --> 02:38.834
-[Robert]: Have. You.
Seen. This?

02:38.875 --> 02:41.792
-Haha, Alomar for Prez.
Classic.

02:41.834 --> 02:44.375
Oh will you just relax Robert?
It's a harmless joke.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.834
-Is it? Well the
joke ends today.

02:46.875 --> 02:52.125
Every year some anarchist
has tried to get Roberto Alomar
elected to student council.

02:52.166 --> 02:57.125
I don't care if he's some
golden glove wearing
baseball slugger.

02:57.166 --> 03:00.625
They're making a mockery
of the democratic process.
A de-mockery.

03:00.667 --> 03:04.208
-The Alomar movement is
bigger than you, it's bigger
than all of us.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.583
-Not anymore it's not.
-What are you...? No you don't.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.792
-Yes I do, yes I do.
-No, no you don't.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.333
-Just...yes I do! Yes I do!
-No you don't! Ow!

03:11.375 --> 03:13.500
-That's your fault.
-Ohhhh.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.709
-Your attention please.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.375
Roberto Alomar is not running
in the student council election.

03:19.417 --> 03:24.667
Furthermore, any Alomar pins,
posters or other paraphernalia
will be confiscated.

03:24.709 --> 03:28.542
And you will automatically
be given a weeks detention.
Thank you.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.041
-[Trudy]: I am team Alomar,
all the way.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.625
Now there are three of us.

03:34.667 --> 03:39.000
-I'm looking for a book on the
history of the electoral
process.

03:39.041 --> 03:42.375
[Lisa]: That's not it.

03:42.417 --> 03:47.208
-Sorry, would you mind putting
the books on the to be shelved
cart when you're done with them?

03:47.250 --> 03:52.417
-Oh. Of course. Yes. I just
took it off for a second though.

03:52.458 --> 03:56.375
-I know, it's just that library
policy clearly states that:

03:56.417 --> 04:00.000
Books are to be reshelved
exclusively, by a librarian.

04:00.041 --> 04:05.542
I mean, I wouldn't go into your
classroom and just shuffle all
your students around. So...

04:05.583 --> 04:07.667
-Okay, I put it back in
the exact same...

04:07.709 --> 04:10.625
Lisa! Ah, oof.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.125
Why don't you just
follow the process?

04:16.500 --> 04:18.667
Super.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.166
-Vote Natalie.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.125
I'm Natalie, student council
president, three years
and running.

04:24.166 --> 04:27.834
Well...It's going to be
three years. I don't lose.

04:29.625 --> 04:33.000
-[Sighs]: Enough.

04:33.041 --> 04:36.166
-Sir?

04:36.208 --> 04:39.125
-Natalie, you can't hang
outside the staff washroom
like that, okay?

04:39.166 --> 04:41.625
-Okay, sorry Mr. Duncan.

04:41.667 --> 04:45.083
-How would you like it if I hung
outside the girls washroom
all day? And waited for you?

04:47.709 --> 04:50.000
I'll never do that.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.458
-I thought we should go over our
schedule for the new school
year.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.792
-I don't need a schedule to
be a role model. Okay?

04:54.834 --> 04:57.709
-I think you might Sir.
There's a lot of meetings
to keep track of.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.458
-Why would we have meetings?
And secondly, you haven't
even won anything yet.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.792
So, jumping the gun
a little bit?

05:03.834 --> 05:06.083
-Just getting a head start,
since I'm going to win.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.875
I always do. No one
ever runs against me.

05:08.917 --> 05:12.667
Mr. Callaghan said, you'd do
whatever you could to help me.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.959
-Bye Sir.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.291
-I'm not doing this.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.250
Monday morning planning
sessions, Friday's after school,
weekly wrap up?

05:23.291 --> 05:26.458
No! Skype and scones?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.667
-[Natalie]: It's pronounced
scones.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.375
-You ever wonder what kinds
of students we don't like?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.333
Perfect example.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.375
-Sir, in case you lose it,
I have another.

05:41.417 --> 05:46.709
-[Robert]: So, do you see
what I see? Or rather don't
see? Take a look.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.875
No Alomar. Oh no,
there's Alomar over there.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.333
Just kidding, there isn't any.
You know why?

05:53.375 --> 05:56.917
Because people respond
to a strong leader.
Which is what I am.

05:56.959 --> 06:02.625
When I lay down the law,
people listen. That's respect.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.875
-I don't particularly have
anything against Natalie really.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.583
Do I like her? No.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.291
Do I want to teach
kids like that? N...

06:11.333 --> 06:13.834
Which camera?
There's two of you now?

06:13.875 --> 06:17.583
Do I want to listen to her
throughout this whole election?
I do not.

06:17.625 --> 06:22.709
And if nobody runs against
her she's going to win by
acclimatization.

06:22.750 --> 06:27.625
-So, to win by acclimation
means to win without opposition.

06:27.667 --> 06:32.250
-[Class laughs]

06:33.542 --> 06:35.750
-Very funny.
Who drew this?

06:37.875 --> 06:42.750
And, I'm serious, I want to
know who drew that picture.

06:42.792 --> 06:46.125
Very clever, who also took
all of my erasers? That's great.

06:48.875 --> 06:53.750
When I find out who drew this
picture and wasted class time
they are in big trouble.

06:56.125 --> 07:00.041
-[Lisa sighs]
I just really want to
get this down.

07:00.083 --> 07:04.375
-Jimmy DeGrazia.
-Hi.

07:04.417 --> 07:07.583
-What do you think about
running for student council
president this year?

07:07.625 --> 07:10.709
-Why would I do that? This
is my last year at high school.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.875
-Ha, if you say so.

07:13.917 --> 07:17.458
-I just want to concentrate
on graduating and getting
out of here.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.542
-But do you really think you're
going to get into university
with the grades you have?

07:20.583 --> 07:22.750
-Iiiii didn't think about that.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.083
-So, if you want to get
into a real university...

07:25.125 --> 07:27.458
You gotta put something on
that application that jumps out.

07:27.500 --> 07:32.000
'Cause your grades don't jump
out and that thing is, student
council president.

07:32.041 --> 07:36.000
-I guess so, but...
it's in two days, right?

07:36.041 --> 07:38.709
-It's a popularity contest.
You've been here six
years Jimmy.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.125
You're the most popular kid
in the school, this is easy.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.583
-Yeah, well...
-Right?

07:43.625 --> 07:45.542
-Yeah...I don't know,
it seems like a lot of work.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.166
-That's the good thing.
You don't have to do any work.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.959
Once you're president,
you just give everybody
else the work to do for you.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.709
-Like how you get us to
grade our own papers
during class time?

07:55.750 --> 07:58.291
-Look, that's what great
leaders do. We delegate.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.208
You think Obama cuts
the lawn at the White House?

08:01.250 --> 08:03.917
No, he has somebody do
that for him. He does nothing.

08:03.959 --> 08:07.667
Easiest job in the world.
You can be president, Jimmy.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.959
-Hahaha...
President Jimmy.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.250
What's up?
Here to stay.

08:17.291 --> 08:22.291
-Also, don't forget that the
student council elections
are two days away.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.583
So, make sure you vote.
And in case you haven't heard...

08:25.625 --> 08:30.875
Our good friend Jimmy here is
now running for the position of
student council president.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.333
So, who's voting for Jimmy?

08:34.542 --> 08:36.750
One person?

08:36.792 --> 08:39.000
-I mean, I guess I
thought I was popular.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.792
You know, I babysat
a lot of them. I thought
that would do it.

08:41.834 --> 08:44.458
I don't know, can I go?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.709
I have tons of friends.
-Yeah? Where are they?

08:46.750 --> 08:49.667
-College.
-College.

08:49.709 --> 08:52.166
Oh my god.
Get out.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.875
-Okay.

08:54.917 --> 08:59.667
-Alright, you guys get out too.
I've had enough of this
stupid school project.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.333
-[Mouths]: Vote for Natalie.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.667
-Can I speak to you
for a second please?

09:06.709 --> 09:09.166
-Yes.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.542
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.959
-Exactly, while I'm putting
posters all over the school.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.208
-Oh yeah, the posters your grade
eights did during class time.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.458
-Doesn't matter, I had
them done. Alright?

09:19.500 --> 09:22.792
This election is tomorrow and
you've done absolutely nothing.

09:22.834 --> 09:26.041
-Because you said, I don't
have to do anything. So...

09:26.083 --> 09:28.291
-You said you were
popular, so we both lied.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.291
If you want to get into
university, remember
what we said?

09:31.333 --> 09:33.291
You want to get in? Jimmy?
-Yes, yeah.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.875
-You gotta do something alright?
-Okay.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.291
-Have you done a speech?
-Mmm mmm. No.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.500
-No speech? I told you,
you need to do a speech
in front of the whole school.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.709
Alright? You have to
promise a bunch of stuff.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.000
Doesn't matter what it is. You
just promise a bunch of crap.

09:46.041 --> 09:49.041
And they will buy it.
-I've never written
a speech before.

09:49.083 --> 09:53.083
I don't know where to start.
-Fine, I'll write a speech.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.542
Come here for a second.
Excuse us.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.750
Excuse me. Excuse me. Not now.

09:57.792 --> 10:00.250
I need you to get some
dirt on this Natalie girl.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.500
Otherwise, she's going to
make my life hell if she
wins this thing.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.792
-I don't know her.
I don't know anything about her.

10:04.834 --> 10:07.333
She's too geeky.
-That's what finding dirt means.

10:07.375 --> 10:10.000
You dig, you look around,
you ask questions.

10:10.041 --> 10:13.083
I heard she's allergic
to peanut butter.

10:13.125 --> 10:16.208
And I could slip
some into her locker.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.417
-Why don't you just blow
her head off Jimmy?

10:18.458 --> 10:21.750
I said, get dirt.
You don't kill her.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.125
Hey guys. Hello.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.500
-So, how was your day yesterday?
-Oh...

10:32.542 --> 10:35.458
It was good. Um, the kids were
really excited about the
election.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.667
-Erase much?
-What?

10:37.709 --> 10:41.125
-Oh, I was just wondering
if you erased much yesterday.

10:41.166 --> 10:45.959
-I'm just wondering if maybe
you borrowed my erasers?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.250
And forgot to put them back?
-Wow!

10:50.583 --> 10:53.709
No need to make a scene.

10:53.750 --> 11:00.959
-Okay, um, Emma, if you have a
problem with me I would love to
sit down and talk it out.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.125
-I don't have a problem.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.333
But I can see that
you're really upset.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.834
And you should be.

11:08.875 --> 11:14.500
I mean, I would be really upset
if if someone came into MY
classroom and messed it up.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.041
So...

11:18.083 --> 11:23.917
What some teachers don't
understand is that the library
is my classroom.

11:23.959 --> 11:29.875
These books are my students and
at the end of the day it's all
about the children.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.917
Libraries are pretty useless
anyways. Most of us just
look it up on the internet.

11:36.959 --> 11:41.125
-Vote for Jimmy, alright?
Tell everybody. Girls? Jimmy.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.959
I heard Jimmy's gaining ground
in the student election.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.792
And you know what?
Good for Jimmy because,
he's been here a long time.

11:47.834 --> 11:51.583
And he's never really had
anything to sort of...do.

11:51.625 --> 11:56.083
So it's nice. It's nice
for him, and...Oh!

11:56.125 --> 11:59.125
Did you hear that?
Jimmy's gaining ground.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.750
So now it is a two person race.

12:01.792 --> 12:05.166
-Sir, you're the student council
liaison, you shouldn't be
taking sides.

12:05.208 --> 12:09.875
-Who's taking sides? I'm just
happy to see a fellow student
do well.

12:09.917 --> 12:13.917
[Quietly]: And I don't want
you to win. So, let that sink
into your head.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.125
So, what are you going to do.
-Hmm.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.709
-Oh Natalie. Don't vote
for the sore loser. I wouldn't.

12:19.750 --> 12:24.250
-Well, suffice to say the Alomar
insurgency has been quashed.

12:24.291 --> 12:27.834
Ha, they said I couldn't do it.

12:27.875 --> 12:31.583
They said I didn't have it
in me. Some of them even
said, I was an idiot.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.834
-[Trudy]: You are an
idiot Robert.
-Not now.

12:35.917 --> 12:39.875
Let the record show, where
there's a will there's a way.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.000
-[Noise on window]
-What the...?

12:44.917 --> 12:46.917
[Gasps]

12:49.542 --> 12:51.917
Who are you?

12:51.959 --> 12:55.583
-[Trudy laughs]

12:55.625 --> 12:58.166
-Sorry guys.
David?

12:58.208 --> 13:00.834
Have you seen Jimmy?
-Ah, yup.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.542
-Okay, do you want to tell
me where you've seen him?

13:03.583 --> 13:07.083
-Check the back.
-Okay, was that so hard?

13:07.125 --> 13:09.834
Sorry to bother you, grumpy.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.917
Jimmy? Could I speak to you in
private please?
-Sure.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.417
-It's okay, I've got
to get going anyways.
-[Gerry]: Yeah.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.792
-Yeah, alright, see ya.
-A lot more campaigning to do.

13:17.834 --> 13:20.000
-[Gerry]: Good luck with that.
-Vote Natalie.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.166
-Wow.
-What are you doing?

13:22.208 --> 13:24.959
Please tell me why you're
talking to her.
-I was digging up information.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.417
That's what you told me to do.
-That's not digging
up information.

13:27.458 --> 13:31.417
Holding her hand.
-Well, the more I found
out, the more I liked her.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.125
-Oh my god, you like her?
How is that even possible?

13:34.166 --> 13:37.458
-It turns out, she's
actually pretty cool.
We just click.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.792
And I would have never asked
her out, if it wasn't for you.

13:40.834 --> 13:43.667
Soooo...Thank you.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.083
-I should have gone with
the peanut butter idea.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.333
-Hey, do you guys find
Emma a little strange?

13:49.375 --> 13:53.667
-What do you mean?
-Well, I'm pretty sure
she stole my eraser.

13:53.709 --> 13:57.417
-[Gasps]: That bitch.
-Don't you find that weird?

13:57.458 --> 13:59.375
-Check it out! Emma
brought cupcakes again.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.709
-[Bobbi]: Oooh.
-She's great isn't she?

14:01.750 --> 14:04.083
-[Bobbi]: Are those red velvet?
-Yeah, her secret is love.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.333
And a whole lot of lard.
-[Bobbi]: Mmmmm.

14:06.375 --> 14:10.041
-Guys! Do you not
find this strange?

14:10.083 --> 14:13.333
She snuck into my room
and stole all my erasers.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.542
Why is this not
bothering anyone?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.583
-She made cupcakes.
-Just get another eraser.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.834
Problem solved.
-Ugh, those look terrible.

14:26.500 --> 14:31.166
-Jimmy. Natalie.
What can I do for you two.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.875
-It's okay Jimmy,
I'm here for you. Tell him.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.500
-Alright.
I'm out.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.834
I just can't run against
my girlfriend.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.333
Hoes before bros, right?

14:41.375 --> 14:44.750
-The expression is
bros, before hoe...

14:44.792 --> 14:47.458
-[Jimmy]: Ohhh.
-St...Students.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.417
-Oh, well it sucks that
we're not bros.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.834
-[Natalie]: Come on Jimmy,
told you he wouldn't understand.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.583
-[Jimmy]: Okay.
-You know, you can stop smiling.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.625
Because I can easily talk
him into running again.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.709
-Can you? Because I can
talk him out of anything.

15:01.750 --> 15:05.583
I've been class president
for two years in a row,
for a reason, Sir.

15:05.625 --> 15:10.834
My mother says I'm very
focused and if I want something
I don't stop until I get it.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.667
And I don't let anything
stand in my way.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.834
Hmm.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.583
-You caught all that didn't you?
You caught that?

15:21.625 --> 15:25.208
You need to show that to Jimmy.
I want you to take the camera
and show it to Jimmy.

15:25.250 --> 15:29.250
-Hey guys, I think Emma went
into my classroom yesterday.

15:29.291 --> 15:32.083
And I was just wondering if you
might have any footage of that?

15:34.041 --> 15:36.166
-Did you not see me standing
here doing something?

15:37.709 --> 15:39.959
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Okay? Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.166
Well that's a little late.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.125
Give me the footage.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.166
-[Lisa]: Stupid permanent
marker.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.333
[Lisa sighs]

15:51.375 --> 15:55.291
Yes, of course I could
get another eraser.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.333
But it's not about the
eraser, is it?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.792
[Lisa takes a deep breath]

16:00.834 --> 16:03.792
That woman is nuts.
[Lisa is upset]

16:03.834 --> 16:06.291
Arghhhh.

16:06.333 --> 16:10.834
-Someone, is running a fake
Roberto Alomar campaign
around the school.

16:10.875 --> 16:15.417
So forgive me for thinking I
should maybe start by
eliminating the usual suspects.

16:15.458 --> 16:19.041
No offense.
-Tons taken.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.959
Is this seriously why you
called me into your office?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.750
It's exactly why, Trudy. You've
always been a bit of a wildcard.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.000
I'm not going to take my
chances with you.

16:28.041 --> 16:31.667
-Okay, I'm going to go, because
I have actual work to do.

16:31.709 --> 16:36.083
-So long as you know that I
am going to be keeping
an eye on you.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.458
-You and every other man I meet.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.291
Wow, is that a bat in your hand?
Or are you jus...oh it is a bat.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.792
Wow.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.625
-Dismissed.
Get out.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.000
-[Gerry]: Jimmy, stop. Stop.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.750
Natalie for prez. Great.
You don't get it do you?

16:53.792 --> 16:55.959
She wants you to drop
out of the election.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.125
And vote for her,
and let her win.

16:58.166 --> 17:01.083
So that she wins! And I'm
stuck with her for the year.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.375
-That is exactly what she
said you'd say. Wow.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.458
-Oh my god, you're buying this.
She's too smart.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.000
She's too smart and
you're too stupid. Oh my god.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.542
Thanks for nothing.

17:10.583 --> 17:13.750
-You want to play games Emma?
We can play games.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.875
Let's play some games.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.875
Oh look, this book needs
to go in the cart.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.125
Let's make some
room for the book.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.291
-Lisa's really lost it, huh?

17:26.333 --> 17:28.750
-Oh, that is way off the cart.

17:28.792 --> 17:31.000
-What do you say we go get
a couple of cold ones? Okay?

17:31.041 --> 17:33.792
Then maybe we can pick up
a couple of hot ones, haha.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.083
Am I right?
-[Emma laughs]

17:36.125 --> 17:38.417
-[Trudy]: Hey, how's it
going Robert?

17:38.458 --> 17:41.208
-How's it going? You tell me.
-[Bobbi]: Did you get them all?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.792
-[Robert laughs]

17:43.834 --> 17:45.750
[Robert]: What the...?

17:47.792 --> 17:51.166
[Robert grunts]

17:52.709 --> 17:55.250
[Robert grunts]

17:57.875 --> 18:02.000
-[Students cheer]

18:03.709 --> 18:06.792
-Why should you re-elect me
as student council president?

18:06.834 --> 18:09.500
The answer is three fold.
One...

18:09.542 --> 18:11.667
-I still don't know
why I'm doing this.

18:11.709 --> 18:15.041
-I told you, it's a great thing
to have on a resume.
And you get to be a leader.

18:15.083 --> 18:19.000
And you get to have people work
underneath you.
-And?

18:19.041 --> 18:21.834
-And, I'll give you an extra
week on your independent study
project.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.291
-Two weeks.
-A week and a half.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.500
-Three.
-You can't go up the other way.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.917
-I guess there's no deal.
-Fine. Three weeks.

18:29.959 --> 18:32.542
Just read the speech I gave you.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.333
Wait 'til you hear this,
automatic winner.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.500
-...That a vote for Natalie,
is a vote for Xavier.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.083
Thank you.
-[Clapping]

18:41.125 --> 18:43.667
-Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

18:43.709 --> 18:47.417
-[Callaghan]: Thank you Natalie.
Now we'll hear from our next
candidate, David Alexander.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.208
-[Gerry]: Okay, oh hi David.
-[Clapping]

18:50.250 --> 18:54.333
-[Gerry]: Hmm, didn't even
know he was in the running.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.709
-What up Xavier?
-What up?

18:56.750 --> 19:00.166
-I could give you a long boring
speech, like the other
candidate.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.458
But I'm not going to
waste your time.

19:02.500 --> 19:08.875
All you need to know is, a vote
for me is a vote for Friday's
off, free burger Tuesday's...

19:08.917 --> 19:11.083
And casual Wednesday's.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.166
No shirts, no shoes? No problem.

19:17.792 --> 19:21.500
-[Gerry claps, alone]

19:21.542 --> 19:23.750
-I have a two part question.
-[Mouths]: Shut up Lucy.

19:23.792 --> 19:26.417
One, how will we complete
the standardize curriculum
in a four day week?

19:26.458 --> 19:30.083
And two, has Mr. Callaghan
agreed to Friday's off?

19:33.125 --> 19:35.375
-[Gerry]: Pshh.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.834
-Not exactly...
-Friday's off would be good.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.709
-[Gerry]: That all you got?
[Whispers]: Didn't work,
didn't work.

19:46.417 --> 19:55.000
-Mr. Malik! I think I got the
last Alomar poster this time.

19:55.041 --> 19:58.083
-What happened to your fingers?
-Never mind.

19:58.125 --> 20:01.709
-Have a good evening
Mr. Cheeley.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.542
All clear.
-You ready?

20:04.583 --> 20:06.875
-[Malik]: Yes Mr. Alomar,
thank you so much.

20:06.917 --> 20:09.083
This is going to
drive him crazy.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.250
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

20:11.291 --> 20:14.166
-I just retired.
Sometime I get bored.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.458
So I drop in, by the
schools and I mess around.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.417
-[Malik]: Don't press
the button.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.750
-The elevator came on.
-[Malik]: Everytime.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.417
I'd like to call
the meeting to order.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.417
Can I get a second?

20:29.458 --> 20:31.917
-[Gerry sighs]
-Wonderful.

20:31.959 --> 20:35.250
So, Mr. Duncan, Rhonda
needs you to attend the
school fundraising meeting.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.041
It's next Tuesday at 7AM.
-That's not happening.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.583
-Noted.
-[Gerry sighs]

20:40.625 --> 20:43.291
-We also really need to
revamp the school constitution.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.583
Which weekend works
for everyone?

20:45.625 --> 20:49.959
-Okay, just so we're clear,
I'm not doing any weekend
meetings, morning meetings.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.625
After school, nothing.

20:52.667 --> 20:56.542
I'll do 15 minutes during
my lunch once a week.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.709
Only if it's necessary and
I deem it necessary.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.500
-But, what about our
weekly fun run? It's 10K.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.125
-You guys do a weekly
10K fun run, do you?

21:08.834 --> 21:11.375
-[Student council laughs]
-We don't run.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.875
-10 kilometres?
Are you kidding me?

21:13.917 --> 21:16.375
-[Laughter continues]

21:16.417 --> 21:18.875
-[Natalie]: Sorry, inside joke
with the student council.
-[More giggling]
