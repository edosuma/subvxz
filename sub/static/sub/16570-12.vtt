WEBVTT

00:08.324 --> 00:09.586
No.

00:12.195 --> 00:13.457
Yeah.

00:13.630 --> 00:17.566
No, just with everything that's going on,
I just think it'd be the perfect getaway.

00:18.468 --> 00:21.437
Well, I know,
but it's not even that expensive.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.596
Three thousand,
and that includes everything.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.602
Mm-hm.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.711
Oh, and did I mention
it's even got a theater onboard...

00:29.879 --> 00:31.938
...where they do shows
every single night?

00:33.083 --> 00:34.744
And there's dancing.

00:35.318 --> 00:37.218
It's like a floating city.

00:38.588 --> 00:39.987
Rob?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:10.253 --> 01:11.447
Lieutenant.

01:11.621 --> 01:16.285
It appears the first cut severed
the carotid artery, punctured the larynx.

01:16.459 --> 01:19.394
Wounds to the shoulder
and thorax on this side suggest...

01:19.562 --> 01:22.326
...whoever did this was left-handed.
- Left-handed.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.592
- No sexual assault.
- Doesn't appear so.

01:29.939 --> 01:31.270
Already tagged it, chief.

01:31.441 --> 01:33.932
Detective Sanchez confirmed
the ashtray was gone...

01:34.110 --> 01:36.237
...when the first responders arrived.

01:36.813 --> 01:38.781
Sergeant, who called this in?

01:38.948 --> 01:42.349
The neighbors, after hearing the screams.
The husband's screams.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.352
Rob Price,
he's out front with Flynn now.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.750
These here...

01:47.957 --> 01:51.120
All these?
These are all his bloody footprints...

01:53.296 --> 01:57.596
...from here all the way out to the street.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.928
The folks next door said
they heard shouting...

02:00.103 --> 02:04.096
...saw him outside, behaving, uh,
as they put it, "like a madman."

02:04.274 --> 02:06.640
- They see who he might have been chasing?
- No.

02:08.144 --> 02:09.168
So here it is.

02:09.345 --> 02:12.576
Husband Robert Price claims
he woke suddenly from a deep sleep...

02:12.749 --> 02:15.809
...came outside and found his wife
lying dead by the pool...

02:15.985 --> 02:20.046
...and a man dressed in black,
wearing a black mask, fleeing the scene.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.453
The killer, and I quote,
"looked like a ninja."

02:23.459 --> 02:26.394
- A ninja?
- Husband's breath was about 40 proof.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.895
Back when I drank like that,
I saw ninjas too.

02:29.599 --> 02:32.898
Chief. Apparently, the victim was talking
to her cousin on the phone...

02:33.069 --> 02:35.003
...about a cruise she was planning.

02:35.171 --> 02:37.571
Cousin heard the victim call out
her husband's name.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.504
Heard sounds of a struggle
and then nothing.

02:40.677 --> 02:42.907
- We got the warrant for the house.
- Thank you, detective.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.014
Um, do you have a consent form and a pen?

02:46.749 --> 02:50.241
- Chief, we already got the warrant.
- Yeah, I heard him, lieutenant. Thank you.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.411
Uh, Lieutenant Tao.

02:54.824 --> 02:57.554
Mr. Price, I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson
of Major Crimes.

02:57.727 --> 02:59.991
The guy, what are you doing to find him?

03:00.163 --> 03:02.461
All we possibly can, sir,
but we need your help.

03:02.632 --> 03:05.192
Your wife's killer
might have been in your house...

03:05.368 --> 03:06.926
...at some point this evening.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.037
Would you consent to a search?

03:09.873 --> 03:11.602
- Okay.
- Just sign right here.

03:19.649 --> 03:22.709
Thank you. Now, this is Lieutenant Tao
from Crisis Response.

03:22.886 --> 03:25.821
He'll see to it that you're comfortable
and well taken care of.

03:26.589 --> 03:28.147
This way, sir, please.

03:28.324 --> 03:31.122
Detective Sanchez,
compile a list of all police reports...

03:31.294 --> 03:34.058
...made within a 5-mile radius
over the past 6 hours.

03:34.230 --> 03:38.326
I imagine a medieval Japanese assassin
must have caught someone's attention.

03:38.501 --> 03:39.798
You don't really think...

03:39.969 --> 03:42.267
No, but I don't wanna hear
a defense attorney...

03:42.438 --> 03:45.601
...say that I let a ninja get away
because we didn't look for one.

03:45.775 --> 03:49.575
Thank you. Uh, gentlemen, collect all knives
and remove the computers.

03:49.746 --> 03:54.206
If the left-handed Mr. Price was having
an affair, I'd like the e-mails proving it.

04:03.459 --> 04:05.484
- Did you find him yet?
- Oh, the man in black?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.493
No, but we're looking very hard.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.928
Mr. Price, Lieutenant Tao
may have explained...

04:10.099 --> 04:12.567
...that one of the things we do
in Crisis Response...

04:12.735 --> 04:15.795
...is encourage the families
of the victims to speak freely.

04:15.972 --> 04:19.135
You never know what little detail
might unlock the whole puzzle.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.402
So you need me to tell you again
what I saw.

04:22.178 --> 04:26.012
Yes. But before you do,
there's a formality we need to go through.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.413
The sooner we get through it,
the faster we can focus on the manhunt.

04:29.585 --> 04:33.749
It's all that stuff you've heard all before,
about the right to remain silent.

04:33.923 --> 04:36.517
- The right to an attorney.
- You're Mirandizing me?

04:37.827 --> 04:40.853
It's just boilerplate.
It's stuff that we have...

04:41.030 --> 04:43.999
Why the hell are you wasting your time
telling me my rights?

04:44.167 --> 04:46.260
I told you,
I had nothing to do with this!

04:46.436 --> 04:50.497
Mr. Price, our best officers are searching
the streets for your wife's killer...

04:50.673 --> 04:51.935
...but they need your help.

04:52.108 --> 04:55.043
I'm not allowed to take
your whole statement unless we get...

04:55.211 --> 04:56.542
Chief.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.781
- There's something you gotta hear.
- One minute, detective.

05:01.417 --> 05:04.045
If you honestly wanna help us
find your wife's killer...

05:04.220 --> 05:05.710
Chief.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.080
Seriously.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.495
Excuse me, Mr. Price. I'll be right back.

05:16.866 --> 05:20.233
- This had better be good, detective.
- It is.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.165
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

05:22.338 --> 05:24.465
<i>You need to
send somebody right away!</i>

05:24.640 --> 05:27.473
<i>There's a man in our backyard
trying to break in. Hurry!</i>

05:27.643 --> 05:30.077
<i>Calm down,
ma'am. Can you describe the intruder?</i>

05:30.246 --> 05:32.908
<i>I don't know. He's 6 feet tall.</i>

05:33.082 --> 05:35.983
<i>He's wearing...
It's like a Halloween costume.</i>

05:36.152 --> 05:39.280
<i>He's all in black. Please.</i>

05:39.455 --> 05:41.047
<i>Send somebody.</i>

05:41.224 --> 05:45.058
That was 40 minutes before Lisa Price
was stabbed 4 miles east of the house.

05:45.228 --> 05:48.425
Okay, and the caller later told police
that she saw the guy's car:

05:48.598 --> 05:50.964
A classic red Mustang
with temporary dealer tags...

05:51.134 --> 05:53.602
...that had "Mejores Motors" on it.
We checked online.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.262
There's only one Mejores Motors
in the U.S. It's in El Paso, Texas.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.273
Would you please get someone
from El Paso P.D. on the line?

06:00.443 --> 06:04.277
Maybe they can send someone over
to that dealership. Thank you.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.382
<i>The second a lawyer comes in here...</i>

06:07.550 --> 06:09.450
Tao, what do you know about ninjas?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.611
What, I'm Asian-American,
I'm supposed to be an expert on ninjas?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.950
Uh, yeah.

06:15.124 --> 06:19.618
Okay, in Japanese lore the ninja is a warrior
trained in unconventional martial arts.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.129
Weapons include the throwing star,
the ninjaken, a short sword.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.358
Chief? Chief, I got Texas on the line.

06:25.535 --> 06:29.437
Oh, thank you, sergeant.
Uh, put them on speakerphone, please.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.801
<i>Detective Curt Landry, El Paso, P.D.
To whom am I speaking?</i>

06:35.978 --> 06:39.812
This is Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
L.A.P.D., Major Crimes.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.314
Sorry to bother y'all
so early in the morning.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.045
I imagine it's an earlier morning
where you are, ma'am.

06:45.221 --> 06:48.554
- What can I do for you?
- Uh, we are investigating a murder...

06:48.724 --> 06:53.127
...and it seems the car our suspect used
may have been purchased in El Paso.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.058
Is that so?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.531
What's this homicide about?

06:58.701 --> 07:01.568
<i>A young woman was stabbed
between 25 and 30 times...</i>

07:01.737 --> 07:03.398
...last evening around midnight.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.734
We haven't ruled out the husband
as a suspect...

07:05.908 --> 07:08.468
This killer, uh, was he left-handed?

07:10.079 --> 07:13.344
Uh, actually, sir, we believe he was.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.179
Any chance he was dressed all in black,
like one of them ninja fellas?

07:20.623 --> 07:23.490
- He may have been, yes.
- Is the sun up where you are, ma'am?

07:24.227 --> 07:25.785
It's just rising now, sir.

07:25.962 --> 07:29.090
Then the good citizens of Los Angeles
will be safe until nightfall.

07:29.265 --> 07:31.426
I'll be there in four hours for a full briefing.

07:31.601 --> 07:34.092
Oh, Detective Landry,
you don't need to come here, sir.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.795
I'm afraid I do, ma'am.
I'll see you in a bit.

07:39.008 --> 07:42.068
Uh, Detective Landry, wait. Hello?

07:42.245 --> 07:44.372
Hello? Hello? Hello?

07:56.425 --> 07:59.588
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:59.762 --> 08:03.960
I stood 40 minutes on the curb
at the airport waiting for you.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.794
Well, Daddy.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.528
I called you half a dozen times
on your cell phone.

08:08.704 --> 08:10.035
Why didn't you pick up?

08:10.206 --> 08:12.367
Well, how was I to know
you were gonna call me?

08:12.542 --> 08:15.909
They make you turn off your cell phone
when you get on the airplane.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.807
You know what? It's okay.

08:19.182 --> 08:22.015
We both know I'm not gonna be around
too much longer.

08:22.185 --> 08:25.450
So you might as well get a jump on it
by starting to forget me now.

08:25.621 --> 08:27.919
Grandpa, you have no idea
what Aunt Brenda does...

08:28.090 --> 08:30.718
...or how hard she works
or how serious it all is.

08:34.996 --> 08:38.524
Well, thank you, Charlie,
but people don't need to know that.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.965
First, I do know.

08:41.136 --> 08:43.537
And second, her name is not Charlie.

08:43.706 --> 08:46.641
It's Charlene, after my mother,
not Charlie.

08:46.809 --> 08:49.642
What is it about L.A.
that when somebody comes here...

08:49.812 --> 08:51.746
...they're encouraged
to be somebody else?

08:51.914 --> 08:54.144
Oh, thank you, honey,
but I'm not staying.

08:54.317 --> 08:56.842
Uh, I'm taking a quick shower
and heading back to work.

08:57.019 --> 08:58.919
What? I just got here.

08:59.088 --> 09:02.319
Now you're turning around and leaving?
Really?

09:02.491 --> 09:05.221
Daddy, I have a murder.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.259
Now where are you going?

09:08.698 --> 09:10.962
Charlie, it was sweet of you
to stick up for me...

09:11.133 --> 09:12.691
I'm not ready to go home yet.

09:12.868 --> 09:16.360
Well, I guess I'm just a chauffeur
come here to take Charlene home.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.439
Charlie, you can't stay. Your parents...

09:18.608 --> 09:20.200
My parents don't understand me.

09:20.376 --> 09:22.844
My dad thinks I'm still 8
and my mom... They just...

09:23.012 --> 09:26.880
They don't know me anymore,
at least not the way you and Uncle Fritz do.

09:28.517 --> 09:31.350
I feel like I'm a different person here
than I am at home.

09:31.520 --> 09:35.320
- I understand what you're going through...
- One second. Give me one second.

09:35.491 --> 09:39.359
I did some things when I first got here
and I'm really sorry for that.

09:39.528 --> 09:44.124
But I feel like, especially in this past week,
we've become so much closer.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.733
We have, haven't we?

09:45.901 --> 09:49.564
I might be closer to you and Uncle Fritz
than to anyone else in the world.

09:49.739 --> 09:51.969
Please don't make me go home yet.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.167
Before we talk about your staying here...

09:56.345 --> 09:58.939
...you're gonna have to convince Grandpa
to leave you.

09:59.115 --> 10:00.343
I can do that.

10:02.451 --> 10:07.548
Well, you manage that
and we'll see what we can do.

10:07.723 --> 10:10.556
- Hey.
- Fritzie, I didn't know you were back.

10:10.726 --> 10:11.886
Hey, Uncle Fritz.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.732
Thank you.

10:31.447 --> 10:34.041
When I said I wanted kids,
I didn't mean other people's.

10:34.216 --> 10:39.085
Oh, don't worry. Daddy's never gonna
let her stay here in a million years.

10:39.622 --> 10:42.284
Although, I do wish she lived nearer,
don't you?

10:42.458 --> 10:43.584
Not in the next bedroom.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.124
- Do you have my ViCAP results?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.756
Using strict parameters,
home invasion, after-dark...

10:52.935 --> 10:55.301
...stabbing, left-hander,
no sexual component...

10:55.471 --> 10:57.803
...I found 85 murders
resembling your killing.

10:57.973 --> 10:58.997
Eighty-five?

10:59.175 --> 11:03.111
My old buddy Tom Welch, remember him?
He just got assigned to El Paso.

11:03.279 --> 11:06.112
He's driving by Mejores Motors
to check on your Mustang.

11:06.282 --> 11:07.977
Oh, thank you, Fritzie.

11:08.150 --> 11:10.550
- Brenda?
- What?

11:11.253 --> 11:12.652
Charlie is going.

11:13.389 --> 11:15.880
Yes, yes, yes. I know. I know.

11:16.058 --> 11:19.653
If I wanted to be ignored by my
family I could have stayed home.

11:24.433 --> 11:28.494
Chief Johnson, I believe you've
already spoken with Detective Landry.

11:28.671 --> 11:30.002
So nice to meet you, chief.

11:30.172 --> 11:33.005
Very glad to get your call this morning.
That's the truth.

11:33.175 --> 11:37.737
And so kind of you to fly all this way
just to brief me, detective.

11:37.913 --> 11:42.247
Now, as I seem to be joining y'all a bit late,
um, maybe you could catch me up.

11:44.086 --> 11:45.849
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

11:46.021 --> 11:48.421
Well, since, uh, Detective Landry
has been kind enough...

11:48.591 --> 11:51.685
...to share his concerns with me,
I will now share mine with you.

11:52.728 --> 11:56.494
Before we alert the people of Los Angeles
that there is a ninja on the loose...

11:56.665 --> 11:59.463
...I'd like to be sure
we're talking about the same person.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.728
I have some questions about that myself.

12:01.904 --> 12:05.362
These are the young women
who were murdered in El Paso...

12:05.541 --> 12:07.975
...who you think were killed
by the same person...

12:08.144 --> 12:10.009
...who murdered my victim last night.

12:10.179 --> 12:14.206
While I do see similarities,
nowhere in these articles does it mention...

12:14.383 --> 12:16.374
...that the attacker was a ninja.

12:20.756 --> 12:24.886
Well, I was afraid that if we released
that particular detail to the press...

12:25.060 --> 12:28.393
...the next time the killer struck,
he'd be dressed as a rodeo clown...

12:28.564 --> 12:29.963
...or perhaps a nun.

12:30.132 --> 12:34.228
Was there anything else
that you withheld from the press?

12:34.403 --> 12:37.531
That does seem like a fair place
to begin.

12:37.706 --> 12:41.506
Fine. How about I tell you what I believe
and what I don't believe.

12:42.645 --> 12:47.082
I believe, four months ago, your killer
stabbed to death Joann Hosey...

12:47.249 --> 12:51.413
...living on the west side of El Paso,
taking care of a father with terminal cancer.

12:51.587 --> 12:55.990
And then, two months later,
the same man cut up Juanita Jimenez.

12:56.158 --> 12:57.750
A young mother of three...

12:57.927 --> 13:01.556
...slicing her face up so bad
I had to roll her prints to get an ID on her.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.391
That's what I believe.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.591
And now I'll tell you
what I don't believe.

13:05.768 --> 13:11.229
And I realize that y'all probably see
all manner of weird killers out this way...

13:11.407 --> 13:13.500
...but I don't put a lot of stock in ninjas.

13:13.676 --> 13:17.203
I feel certain when we find this boy,
he'll be a white male...

13:17.379 --> 13:21.577
...25 to 40, with self-esteem issues
he richly deserves.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.550
Now, I'd like to help you grab this guy
and take him back to Texas...

13:25.721 --> 13:27.712
...where we can try him and fry him.

13:27.890 --> 13:32.190
Or as we might say in this day and age,
"Collect him and inject him"...

13:32.528 --> 13:35.895
...which is about as close as
we're gonna get to a happy ending here.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.533
As I see it, the problem
with your happy ending...

13:38.701 --> 13:41.067
...is it leaves too many
unanswered questions...

13:41.237 --> 13:45.071
...for the relatives of other victims
he left scattered across several states.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.343
Well, that's fair enough.

13:48.511 --> 13:52.106
Suppose we try this.
Assuming we catch this little bastard...

13:52.281 --> 13:56.342
...whichever of us ends up with better
evidence gets to take this guy to trial.

13:59.522 --> 14:01.387
Detective, if you wanna make a deal...

14:01.557 --> 14:05.220
...why don't you start by telling us
something we can't get from ViCAP?

14:06.662 --> 14:09.062
Okay. How about this?

14:09.698 --> 14:12.166
You said your fellow
was driving a car from El Paso?

14:13.402 --> 14:16.565
Well, in El Paso, our man was driving
a car from California.

14:19.909 --> 14:23.936
Well, you guys did a great job on this.
Fast too, mm-hm

14:24.113 --> 14:26.206
May I give you a little hint?

14:26.749 --> 14:28.842
He never killed in Holbrook.

14:29.018 --> 14:31.452
Gallup, New Mexico,
that was a domestic thing.

14:32.087 --> 14:36.183
Terrible stabbing in Sonora,
but, uh, he's on death row.

14:36.358 --> 14:40.089
Bowie, Arizona. Remember that town.

14:40.262 --> 14:43.129
If you like Tex-Mex,
there is no place better.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.325
Used to be an Outback.
Guy that took it over did a bang-up job.

14:47.036 --> 14:49.368
Here, you, uh, wanna see
what connects them all?

14:50.506 --> 14:51.837
Of course.

14:52.207 --> 14:55.665
Los Angeles to Phoenix...

14:55.844 --> 14:59.871
...Tucson to El Paso, up to Houston.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.752
It's the I-10. He's getting off the highway
to find his victims.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.511
- Bingo.
- Do you have any DNA matches?

15:06.956 --> 15:09.652
Uh, no law-enforcement agency's
entered any DNA...

15:09.825 --> 15:11.793
...into the national database on this guy.

15:11.961 --> 15:13.451
Chief? Agent Howard.

15:13.629 --> 15:16.462
- Oh, thank you. Pardon me.
- Here she is.

15:17.066 --> 15:18.499
Thanks. Hey.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.363
You ready for more info
on your El Paso car?

15:21.537 --> 15:23.129
<i>Oh, Fritzie, how can I thank you?</i>

15:23.305 --> 15:25.170
<i>Wait until your dad and Charlie leave...</i>

15:25.341 --> 15:27.901
...and I'll come up with something
wholly inappropriate.

15:28.077 --> 15:31.774
Mejores Motors only sold one vintage
red Mustang in the last two years...

15:31.947 --> 15:37.613
...to a Jeffrey Webb of El Paso
recently relocated to Los Angeles.

15:37.786 --> 15:42.621
- Faxing everything over to you right now.
- Oh, thank you so much. I'll see you tonight.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.124
Besides the Mustang,
DMV records show...

15:46.295 --> 15:49.856
...that Jeffrey Webb has six cars
registered to him, all purchased in Texas.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.660
He's also been having
serious marital issues.

15:52.835 --> 15:54.166
Multiple restraining orders.

15:54.336 --> 15:56.827
Wife describes a volatile temper
and physical abuse.

15:57.006 --> 15:59.099
Chief, Webb's definitely not inside.

15:59.274 --> 16:02.402
We're rinsing the drains for blood,
checked the garbage and hamper.

16:02.578 --> 16:05.513
- So far, nothing.
- Well, the car itself is spotless...

16:05.681 --> 16:09.139
...but we did find this souvenir
lighter from Lake Havasu...

16:09.318 --> 16:11.411
...with a great big thumbprint on it.

16:11.587 --> 16:13.646
Hey, chief, that's him. That's Webb.

16:13.822 --> 16:16.882
- Hey. What the hell's going on here?
- Excuse me, sir. Mr. Webb...

16:17.059 --> 16:19.527
- That's my car.
- Exactly what we wanted to hear.

16:19.695 --> 16:22.220
- Are you Jeffrey Webb?
- What?

16:22.398 --> 16:26.266
Did that bitch tell you I raped her?
Look, it's all lies.

16:26.435 --> 16:29.666
- Why don't you take a breath, son?
- No.

16:29.838 --> 16:33.296
- No way I'm going back to Texas.
- Hey. Hey!

16:39.148 --> 16:41.139
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands.

16:41.316 --> 16:43.978
- Okay. Okay.
- Turn around. Hands behind your head.

16:44.153 --> 16:45.586
Behind your head.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.154
- Where you running to, boy?
- I never touched her.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.553
She's doing this because
I wanted the divorce.

16:50.726 --> 16:52.819
I don't know to what you are referring...

16:52.995 --> 16:56.658
...but we believe that your car
was used in the commission of a homicide.

16:56.832 --> 16:59.266
What are you, nuts?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.096
Where were you last night?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.465
I was here, inside my house.

17:05.741 --> 17:08.107
Excuse me. I'm asking the questions here.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.300
He's not your guy.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.946
- What about your car? Was that here too?
- I have no idea where my car was.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.449
I only picked it up this morning
near the airport.

17:17.618 --> 17:21.180
Before then, it could have been anywhere
between here and El Paso.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.280
Look, I have a receipt.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.858
Let me see.

17:29.665 --> 17:30.859
Here.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.765
Check with the shipping office
and find out if this is true, okay?

17:39.341 --> 17:42.504
Chief, I don't understand.
If Webb is telling the truth...

17:42.678 --> 17:45.579
...and someone from the depot
killed the Price woman...

17:45.748 --> 17:49.514
- Wouldn't explain the killings out of state.
- The killer wasn't from the depot.

17:49.685 --> 17:52.381
He was transporting the cars,
using them for the murders.

17:52.554 --> 17:55.022
What you got your man Tao
working on now...

17:55.190 --> 17:58.648
...trying to find the name of the driver.
Nice to have your own people.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.892
Auto shipper says the car was delivered
this morning off a rig out of Houston.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.726
Driver's name is Jesse Ray Moore.

18:04.900 --> 18:09.064
An hour ago, he loaded up
with another shipment bound for Texas.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.065
Sergeant Gabriel, Detective Sanchez,
would y'all get on the 10?

18:13.242 --> 18:15.574
Let's put a warrant out
for Jesse Ray Moore...

18:15.744 --> 18:18.907
...and get pictures to every agency
between here and Houston.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.948
It's possible the first place
they're gonna stop Moore...

18:22.117 --> 18:24.517
...is the scales across the border,
in which case...

18:24.686 --> 18:26.586
He'll be coming back to Texas with me.

18:26.755 --> 18:31.055
Unless one of the cars Mr. Moore's shipping
has those vehicle-locator thingamajigs.

18:31.226 --> 18:33.023
LoJack. Let me get on that, chief.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.858
- Landry, you don't need to...
- I won't let you lose me.

18:47.509 --> 18:50.808
Unit requesting
Air 19, we got your LoJack signal.

18:50.979 --> 18:53.140
Your car carrier's still at the truck stop.

18:53.315 --> 18:55.215
Roger that. Any sign of the driver?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.443
I have negative visual on your driver.

18:57.619 --> 19:00.281
Suspect is not seen at this time.
Use caution.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.283
Green Crown Vic,
your truck right in front of you now.

19:04.459 --> 19:05.949
That's your suspect vehicle.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.595
There's the truck.

19:23.645 --> 19:26.011
- It's locked.
- All right, all right.

19:26.181 --> 19:29.207
You check the restaurant.
I'll check the convenience store.

19:43.198 --> 19:45.223
- He's not in there.
- Not inside.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.501
Hey. Hold it.

19:52.641 --> 19:54.836
Stop.

19:57.713 --> 20:01.274
Pull over! Stop the vehicle!

20:01.450 --> 20:03.281
- Pull over!
- Sanchez.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.555
Control, I got an officer on the vehicle.
Code three. Officer needs help.

20:07.723 --> 20:11.284
Air 19, this is Chief Brenda Leigh
Johnson. I'll be there in two minutes.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.621
Yeah, roger. Advised.
En route, two minute ETA.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.787
Control, be advised,
we need CHP units here now.

20:23.238 --> 20:24.899
Pull over.

20:25.073 --> 20:26.370
Pull over
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

20:37.085 --> 20:38.143
Ah!

20:38.320 --> 20:41.915
We got an officer hanging out of the side,
coming up on a blue flatbed truck.

20:42.090 --> 20:44.581
<i>We are continuing westbound,
Red Valley Road.</i>

20:51.166 --> 20:53.999
Oh, blew him
out of the way. Right out of the way.

21:31.073 --> 21:32.631
Lieutenant Tao?

21:32.808 --> 21:35.038
You son of a bitch.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.472
Lieutenant Tao.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.372
Lieutenant Tao!

21:44.386 --> 21:46.980
<i>- Air 19, where's my backup?
- Yeah, roger that.</i>

21:47.155 --> 21:50.647
<i>Control, if you've got the sheriffs onboard,
get the sheriffs closer.</i>

21:50.826 --> 21:52.088
<i>We need somebody here now.</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:56.489
<i>Coming to a construction site now, guys.</i>

21:56.665 --> 21:58.963
<i>I don't know where he's gonna go
on this one.</i>

22:41.643 --> 22:44.703
- Detective Sanchez, that's enough.
- Julio!

22:45.313 --> 22:47.144
- I think he broke my arm.
- Take it easy.

22:47.315 --> 22:51.046
I know my rights.
I'm not saying nothing without a lawyer.

22:54.556 --> 22:58.322
Oh, that's a good catch.
I don't think we're tossing this one back.

23:00.896 --> 23:03.228
Get up. Get up.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.925
Stand up. Look what you did to my car.

23:11.706 --> 23:14.641
So we found no blood or weapons
in Jesse Ray Moore's truck.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.074
Why do they always have three names?

23:17.245 --> 23:20.442
Okay, gentlemen, let me be clear.
We can only prosecute Mr. Moore...

23:20.615 --> 23:23.243
...for assault on a police officer
and reckless driving.

23:23.418 --> 23:25.181
I'm looking for evidence of murder.

23:25.353 --> 23:28.254
We found this collection of
random items in his lockbox...

23:28.423 --> 23:30.755
...sixteen in all, including an ashtray.

23:30.926 --> 23:33.895
Now, the only fingerprints on them
belong to, uh, Jesse Ray Moore.

23:35.130 --> 23:36.256
- That's it?
- Mm-hm.

23:37.632 --> 23:40.760
Keep looking. He's gotta have those knives.
Call the print shed.

23:40.936 --> 23:44.599
- Tell them to take that 18-wheeler down...
- No, don't bother with that, ma'am.

23:44.773 --> 23:46.934
I wasn't gonna trouble y'all
with it before...

23:47.109 --> 23:51.375
...but Moore has scratches on his neck
that go a long way to closing my case.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.241
- Scratches?
- Hm.

23:53.415 --> 23:56.350
How did you know those scratches
were gonna be there?

23:56.518 --> 24:00.682
Juanita Jimenez,
the little Latina lady that we talked about?

24:00.856 --> 24:03.154
Before she died,
she put up a pretty good fight...

24:03.325 --> 24:06.021
...and got a little skin and blood
under her nails.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.684
Since our killer wore a mask...

24:07.863 --> 24:10.195
...the neck was the only place
it could come from.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.892
You have DNA.
When I asked you if you had a match...

24:14.069 --> 24:16.799
And I told you truthfully
that no law-enforcement agency...

24:16.972 --> 24:19.270
...had entered his DNA
into the national database.

24:19.441 --> 24:20.533
Because you withheld it.

24:20.709 --> 24:25.908
I didn't withhold anything.
I just don't have the staff you've got.

24:26.081 --> 24:27.878
It takes a while to get all this done.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.313
But I think you've done
exceptional work.

24:30.485 --> 24:33.579
And, uh, now if you could just turn
Mr. Moore over to me...

24:33.755 --> 24:36.553
We agreed that whoever had
the best evidence would retain custody.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.783
That we did.

24:37.959 --> 24:42.191
Frankly, there is no conceivable universe
wherein you have better evidence than I do.

24:42.364 --> 24:43.695
Not at the moment, maybe...

24:43.865 --> 24:47.323
...but my detectives are looking through
every car Mr. Moore delivered...

24:47.502 --> 24:48.833
...over the past two years.

24:49.004 --> 24:50.733
And good luck with that.

24:52.040 --> 24:56.067
In the meantime, I'm gonna get
a nice little extradition order for you.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.606
Have a pleasant evening, ma'am.

25:11.026 --> 25:14.257
<i>What a mess out there.
Well, that was the scene in Fontana today...</i>

25:14.429 --> 25:16.420
<i>...after Los Angeles police officers...</i>

25:16.598 --> 25:18.930
<i>...investigating reports
that a murder suspect...</i>

25:19.100 --> 25:22.263
<i>...might be fleeing in a car carrier
bound for the state line...</i>

25:22.437 --> 25:24.405
<i>...confronted the man right on I-10.</i>

25:24.573 --> 25:26.803
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:26.975 --> 25:30.240
Congratulations. It's all over the news.
You actually got this creep.

25:30.412 --> 25:33.540
Yeah, only I may have to give him away.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.350
So what if Landry
takes him off your hands?

25:37.519 --> 25:40.215
No state dispenses justice like Texas.

25:41.089 --> 25:44.058
If by "justice"
you mean executing a man...

25:44.226 --> 25:46.717
...before we know everything he's done,
I disagree.

25:46.895 --> 25:49.659
I'm not arguing it's a perfect solution,
only that, you know...

25:51.299 --> 25:54.462
- Daddy, I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?
- Oh, no matter.

25:54.636 --> 25:58.663
At my age, I sleep better in the daytime,
anyway.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.104
Besides, I've got something
to talk to you about.

26:01.276 --> 26:03.267
Oh, God.

26:06.047 --> 26:07.742
Before she went to bed...

26:07.916 --> 26:10.384
...Charlene gave me
a convincing argument...

26:10.552 --> 26:13.612
...as to why she should stay
out here in California with you.

26:13.788 --> 26:16.916
She's even found a "magnet school,"
whatever that is.

26:17.092 --> 26:18.821
She gave me a pamphlet on it.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.191
But the point is
she does not wanna go home.

26:22.864 --> 26:24.297
And what did you say?

26:25.333 --> 26:31.203
I told her that, uh, whether she stays here
or goes is entirely up to you.

26:32.073 --> 26:33.165
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.310
Look, I know you
want me to be the bad guy here...

26:36.478 --> 26:39.038
...but my main job
as Charlene's grandfather...

26:39.214 --> 26:43.048
...is not to be resented and to say "yes"
to every little thing she wants.

26:43.218 --> 26:48.781
Besides, I refuse to spend five hours
on an airplane with a teenager...

26:48.957 --> 26:52.723
...who thinks it's a terrible punishment
to fly back to Atlanta with me...

26:52.894 --> 26:56.830
...next to staying here
with you in California.

27:06.608 --> 27:08.132
- Brenda?
- Hm?

27:08.310 --> 27:10.210
Did you hear what your father just said?

27:10.378 --> 27:11.675
Yes.

27:11.846 --> 27:13.677
And it makes perfect sense.

27:19.354 --> 27:22.755
How's that extradition order
coming along, Mr. Landry?

27:23.258 --> 27:25.988
Well, the judge has my paperwork.

27:26.161 --> 27:30.325
Shouldn't be long before the good people
of Texas have Mr. Moore on death row.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.633
- The material you asked for.
- Thank you.

27:34.803 --> 27:39.069
Detective Sanchez, Sergeant Gabriel,
Lieutenant Flynn, would y'all join me?

27:39.874 --> 27:42.342
Well, now, you do realize, ma'am...

27:42.510 --> 27:44.637
...you can't question him
without his lawyer?

27:44.813 --> 27:46.280
I don't intend to question him.

27:46.448 --> 27:50.680
I intend to have him revoke his right
to attorney and then watch him confess.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.915
Lieutenant Tao,
would you please join us?

27:54.089 --> 27:56.922
Bring along everything
we found in Mr. Moore's lockbox.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.526
And also your camera
with the big flash.

27:59.694 --> 28:03.460
The big outdoor, really? Okay.

28:04.132 --> 28:07.260
You're going in there with this guy
when you know nothing about him?

28:07.435 --> 28:09.494
I know the one thing
we really need to know.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.730
- What's that?
- He ran.

28:12.807 --> 28:15.037
Which means he wants to live.

28:18.646 --> 28:22.309
Mr. Moore, I don't think
we were properly introduced yesterday.

28:22.484 --> 28:25.749
I'm Chief Johnson. I expect
you remember Detective Sanchez.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.512
He certainly remembers you.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.781
I understand you don't wanna speak
without your attorney...

28:30.959 --> 28:34.486
...and that's just fine with me,
but I will need you to undress.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.563
Now.

28:39.267 --> 28:40.757
<i>Why are we doing this?</i>

28:40.935 --> 28:43.927
<i>We're photographing you
for any wounds, blemishes...</i>

28:44.105 --> 28:45.402
<i>...and, um, physical defects...</i>

28:45.573 --> 28:49.509
<i>...that link you to the crimes
for which you're being investigated.</i>

28:55.250 --> 28:57.184
Lieutenant Tao.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.985
Why is that so bright? It's blinding me.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.750
We're just preparing you
for what you'll experience...

29:03.925 --> 29:08.328
...after you've been found guilty in Texas
and they send you to the electric chair...

29:08.496 --> 29:11.124
...put 50,000 volts
through the top of your head.

29:11.299 --> 29:12.698
Well, that's not fair.

29:12.867 --> 29:15.427
We don't electrocute people anymore.
We're not savages.

29:15.603 --> 29:18.197
- Gel on you to reduce the amount
of seared flesh.

29:18.373 --> 29:21.865
But that won't stop your brain
from boiling inside of your skull.

29:22.043 --> 29:23.601
But that's sort of the point, isn't it?

29:25.013 --> 29:26.378
Where is she headed?

29:26.548 --> 29:29.915
I think she's about to take your suspect
away from you.

29:30.084 --> 29:31.915
<i>Lieutenant Tao, that will do.</i>

29:32.987 --> 29:36.150
- Hey, give those back.
- Those aren't your clothes anymore, sir.

29:36.324 --> 29:37.484
That's evidence.

29:37.659 --> 29:40.856
Detective, you'll see to it
that that gets to the right people?

29:41.029 --> 29:42.223
Thank you.

29:46.634 --> 29:47.965
Now...

29:49.437 --> 29:53.464
...I want you to look at the people
put to death in Texas since February, 2006.

29:53.641 --> 29:54.903
Eighty-four in all.

29:55.076 --> 29:59.103
Tommy Lynn Hawkins, executed after
six months of being on death row.

29:59.280 --> 30:03.580
Michael Jack Raleigh,
executed one year after his conviction.

30:04.419 --> 30:06.250
Tyrone Derrick Johnson.

30:07.522 --> 30:09.513
You get the idea?

30:09.691 --> 30:15.994
And these are all the people put to death
in California during the same time period.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.592
Not one.

30:22.303 --> 30:25.568
But since you have a lawyer
and you won't talk to me...

30:25.740 --> 30:30.040
...I'm walking out of here right now
and turning you over to Texas.

30:33.348 --> 30:36.511
And trust me when I tell you
that they will kill you dead.

30:36.684 --> 30:37.844
No, please.

30:39.787 --> 30:42.620
Don't let them send me back to Texas.
I wanna stay here.

30:42.790 --> 30:47.022
<i>I could help, but there's not a thing
I can do. You insist on having an attorney.</i>

30:47.195 --> 30:49.129
I don't want an attorney.

30:49.297 --> 30:50.696
I wanna talk to you.

30:52.634 --> 30:55.467
But I...

30:55.737 --> 30:56.897
I don't know how, I...

30:58.973 --> 31:02.033
There are just so many things
I never said out loud.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.274
How do I?

31:07.582 --> 31:08.708
How do I tell you?

31:09.851 --> 31:11.318
Well...

31:11.486 --> 31:12.714
...I have an idea.

31:16.691 --> 31:19.159
Why don't we start with these?

31:24.799 --> 31:26.960
We found them in your lockbox.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.070
I'm guessing that they're souvenirs?

31:30.238 --> 31:31.671
Aren't they?

31:32.473 --> 31:35.237
You don't have to say.
You can just nod if you want.

31:38.613 --> 31:40.604
I thought so.

31:41.215 --> 31:42.512
Well...

31:47.388 --> 31:52.325
Why don't you show me
where all of these objects came from?

31:56.331 --> 32:01.496
<i>Why don't we, uh,
get Mr. Moore here something to put on?</i>

32:03.805 --> 32:05.170
You can call me Jesse.

32:05.940 --> 32:08.773
Okay, Jesse.

32:08.943 --> 32:10.103
You can call me Brenda.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.476
Now, all of these objects are unique...

32:16.651 --> 32:19.779
...but I'm guessing the first one...

32:19.954 --> 32:22.718
...that you ever collected,
that's extra special.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.553
Which one would that be?

32:38.806 --> 32:42.105
When you try so hard
to get something right...

32:42.910 --> 32:44.810
...you don't wanna forget it.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.915
And when I look in this mirror...

32:52.086 --> 32:54.179
...I can almost see her looking back.

33:03.331 --> 33:04.662
You wanna smell?

33:20.782 --> 33:22.010
Where did it come from?

33:25.153 --> 33:26.848
Ozona.

33:27.121 --> 33:29.954
She was coming back from her prom,
I think.

33:30.391 --> 33:31.619
She was real pretty.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.027
And did you catch her
when she was outside or inside?

33:35.930 --> 33:38.421
- Do you remember?
- Yes, outside.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.692
Her boyfriend walked her to the door...

33:40.868 --> 33:44.269
...and she stood on the front porch,
watching him drive away, and...

33:45.173 --> 33:49.166
She swayed a little
like she was still dancing.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.440
Killing's like having sex, you know?

34:28.716 --> 34:31.184
Only you don't have to talk to them
after you're done.

34:33.254 --> 34:36.382
Right. Right.

34:50.871 --> 34:54.569
- Still here, detective?
- Well, she's still here.

34:54.742 --> 34:56.801
Seven hours later.

34:57.745 --> 34:59.804
<i>Rob?</i>

35:06.087 --> 35:07.952
I stayed with her for a while.

35:09.791 --> 35:10.815
Did you?

35:12.727 --> 35:17.061
Something special about a woman's body
when the life drains out of it.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.601
There's a quiet there that's...

35:23.070 --> 35:24.765
...soothing.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.874
That's everyone?

35:31.779 --> 35:33.872
You're absolutely sure
there's no one else?

35:34.682 --> 35:38.618
No, 16 is all. People, that is.

35:38.786 --> 35:41.118
You don't wanna know about
the cats or dogs.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.917
I mean, they were just practice, really.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.487
No. That will do it.

35:58.206 --> 35:59.434
Thank you, Jesse.

36:00.608 --> 36:04.044
Excuse me. I'll be back in a bit.

36:20.294 --> 36:23.127
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. I just needed to...

36:25.233 --> 36:26.598
Fine.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.029
That was well done, ma'am.

36:28.202 --> 36:31.365
Thank you, detective.
Your, uh, help was indispensable.

36:32.073 --> 36:34.166
I don't know about that.

36:34.342 --> 36:37.072
As far as taking Mr. Moore
back to Texas with me...

36:37.245 --> 36:39.338
...I spend enough time in court to know...

36:39.513 --> 36:42.175
...that no amount of DNA
is gonna trump a confession...

36:42.350 --> 36:44.477
...much less 16 them.

36:45.319 --> 36:48.254
I've assured Detective Landry
that after we convict Mr. Moore...

36:48.422 --> 36:51.619
...and after he serves his life sentences
here in California...

36:51.792 --> 36:53.760
...then Texas can execute him.

36:53.928 --> 36:55.486
And I appreciate that.

36:57.064 --> 36:59.692
Well, I brought something with me.

36:59.867 --> 37:03.963
I thought you might wanna duplicate
before I get out your hair here.

37:04.205 --> 37:07.436
In that folder's the 16 victims.

37:07.608 --> 37:10.736
I thought you might want a copy
of the sweet faces...

37:10.912 --> 37:15.372
...to go along with all those souvenirs.

37:17.251 --> 37:19.151
Great job again, ma'am.

37:19.320 --> 37:23.017
I'm gonna step in here and call my team
back home now, if you don't mind.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.487
Thanks.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.349
Hey, Brenda.

38:23.985 --> 38:25.577
<i>You gonna come visit me in prison?</i>

38:25.753 --> 38:29.621
I appreciate the invitation, Jesse,
but I don't get to Texas very often...

38:29.790 --> 38:32.350
...especially in the limited time
you'll be there.

38:33.127 --> 38:34.389
What are you talking about?

38:34.562 --> 38:38.225
An extradition order has been filed
to have you removed from California...

38:38.399 --> 38:40.594
<i>...and I'm not sure I can fight it.</i>

38:40.768 --> 38:42.736
<i>You told me I was gonna stay here.</i>

38:42.903 --> 38:45.667
<i>Well, sometimes
these things are out of my hands.</i>

38:45.840 --> 38:48.832
- Red tape and all that.
- You can't do this to me!

38:49.010 --> 38:51.706
Jesse, I think I can.

38:58.486 --> 38:59.919
<i>Sit down.</i>

39:01.355 --> 39:02.947
I played that just right, huh?

39:16.604 --> 39:17.628
Oh!

39:20.741 --> 39:23.141
I know the day you've had,
but prepare yourself.

39:23.310 --> 39:25.437
Brenda Leigh, is that you?

39:25.613 --> 39:29.049
It has been 24 hours
since we discussed that situation.

39:29.216 --> 39:32.310
You're gonna handle with Charlie.
I'm... Charlene.

39:32.486 --> 39:34.920
- You got me doing it.
- You wanna know why I'm late?

39:35.089 --> 39:38.855
I've been listening to a man tell me
how he stabbed 16 women to death.

39:39.026 --> 39:40.357
Well, I love you too.

39:40.528 --> 39:44.362
Just so you're aware of it,
we have a 10 a.m. flight in the morning.

39:44.532 --> 39:47.968
If Charlene doesn't wanna get
on that plane, I'm leaving without her.

40:03.517 --> 40:06.213
You're gonna make me go back,
aren't you?

40:10.191 --> 40:11.988
Charlie...

40:13.127 --> 40:17.791
...I know it feels like people are making you
do things you don't wanna do.

40:18.466 --> 40:21.128
Your parents would be devastated
if you didn't come back.

40:21.302 --> 40:22.462
But what about me?

40:23.571 --> 40:25.129
What about what I want?

40:25.306 --> 40:27.069
I mean, does that just not matter?

40:28.375 --> 40:32.903
Don't you think I've changed? I have.
I'm not the same person that I was.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.047
Charlie, who you are, it...

40:41.322 --> 40:43.552
It doesn't depend on where you are.

40:43.724 --> 40:48.161
Who you are is something
you take with you wherever you go.

40:50.598 --> 40:54.056
Believe me, even if you don't want to.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.529
Do you not want me here?

41:07.248 --> 41:09.273
Oh, Charlie.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.713
You drove me crazy for three
weeks and now you're gonna make me cry.

41:20.227 --> 41:23.526
Of course I want you here. I do, but...

41:29.436 --> 41:30.767
We gave you a second chance.

41:30.938 --> 41:33.600
Don't you think your parents
deserve one too?

41:35.409 --> 41:37.775
Guess I don't have a choice.

41:39.046 --> 41:41.173
And I'm coming.

41:41.348 --> 41:43.441
I'm coming again real soon. I promise.

41:43.617 --> 41:46.552
You know, you always say that
and you never do.

41:54.128 --> 41:56.562
Well, maybe I deserve
a second chance too.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.635
You'll...

42:04.805 --> 42:07.501
You'll be fine. You will.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.245
We'll see.
