00:07.173 --> 00:10.642
- <i>( whip cracks ) </i>
 <i>( man groans )</i>

00:17.650 --> 00:21.253
I thought I would read a verse
from Proverbs, his favorite.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.522
He preferred the
one from Galatians.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.759
You knew him better.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.665
Before I met Thomas,

00:33.667 --> 00:38.303
I was uncertain about being
engaged to a stranger.

00:38.305 --> 00:41.540
But the first thing he told
me about was his family

00:41.542 --> 00:43.809
and how you would welcome me.

00:45.645 --> 00:48.280
He seemed a very good son.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.216
And a better brother.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.253
- ( babbles )
- Abe: <i>I remember</i>
<i> at Mother's funeral...</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:57.790
her casket.

00:57.792 --> 01:01.360
To me, it was like a wooden seed.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.263
<i>I remember asking Thomas,</i>

01:04.265 --> 01:06.498
<i>"Am I to grow</i>
<i>a new mother?"</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:09.368
"No," he said.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.639
But he told me...

01:13.641 --> 01:16.775
"Whatever sprouts
from the dirt is a sign
she'll always be with you."

01:19.245 --> 01:20.712
As will he.

01:25.852 --> 01:30.155
In truth, I too
prefer Galatians.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.461
<i>( whip cracking )</i>

01:36.629 --> 01:38.864
( grunts )

01:41.301 --> 01:43.268
All of this
because of one rebel.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.337
Hewlett
suspects a plot.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.107
- <i>( whip cracks ) </i>
<i>- Hewlett:</i> <i>Face forward, Baker.</i>

01:48.109 --> 01:51.110
Looking in the wrong direction
is what landed you here.

01:51.112 --> 01:54.613
I have a mind to have you
flogged, too, Appleton.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.582
These men let the spy escape.
You let him in.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.650
Your defenses are lacking.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.488
How are we to thwart an attack
if we can't stop one man?

02:09.562 --> 02:12.231
( men chatting )

02:19.239 --> 02:21.406
Ready to be happy?

02:21.408 --> 02:24.343
- Woody came through.
- ( laughs )

02:27.347 --> 02:29.882
Fresh from New York.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.518
The scout was a harbinger.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.655
A strike is imminent.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.725
And now they know
we lack the manpower
to resist.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.628
This barricade is pathetic.

02:46.199 --> 02:50.469
Perhaps if the cannons
were placed somewhere
less ceremonial,

02:50.471 --> 02:52.638
atop the earthworks,
they would be lethal, no?

02:52.640 --> 02:55.507
Yes, but, sir,
the gunners would be
completely exposed.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.810
Unless, of course,
we devise some way
of shielding them.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.553
Indeed.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.292
Richard:
<i>Our stones?</i>

03:13.294 --> 03:17.429
You mean to use
our graveyard
as a quarry?

03:17.431 --> 03:20.299
Yes, I fear
there's not enough time
for a better solution.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.868
This is--

03:22.870 --> 03:26.538
there are many who will
see this as a desecration.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.441
Mm, we're not
going to exhume
the bodies, Richard.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.978
<i>And I shall</i>
<i>replace the stones</i>
<i>as soon as I'm sure</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.980
<i>that this garrison</i>
<i>has been made safe.</i>

03:34.982 --> 03:38.517
You understand the
need for fortifications?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.452
I've not received
reinforcements

03:40.454 --> 03:42.754
to replace the men that
I lost at Connecticut.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.624
Major, with all
due respect,

03:45.626 --> 03:47.693
Setauket
is a small town.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.996
These gravestones
represent our forebearers,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.832
our history, our legacy.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.936
My wife and son
are buried here.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.472
I understand.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.344
You know this town
and these people

04:05.346 --> 04:08.447
far better
than I ever could.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.316
I now see why you,

04:11.318 --> 04:13.652
not I,
nor my engineer,

04:13.654 --> 04:17.356
should be the one
to select the stones
which are to be used.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.757
Naturally, your family
will be exempt.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.778
No, I--

04:39.780 --> 04:41.647
I'm sorry,
I can't.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.049
<i>( door closes )</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:47.319
Very well.
Appleton.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.388
I've completed
my survey, sir.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.957
147 stones in total.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.793
What is the minimum
amount of stones that
you could use?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.662
Mm, two-cannon complement,

04:56.664 --> 04:59.998
six men each,
five if the sergeant
fires the piece...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.467
10.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.536
You shall use
no more than 10.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.538
<i>Which</i>
<i>are the strongest?</i>

05:06.540 --> 05:08.473
<i>Granite is hardest,</i>
<i>though there's but</i>
<i>a few of those.</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.575
Hewlett:
<i>What about slate?</i>

05:10.577 --> 05:13.412
Appleton:
<i>Slate will stop one ball</i>
<i>but it won't stop two.</i>

05:13.414 --> 05:16.381
<i>I'll examine the limestone.</i>
<i>The ones least weathered,</i>
<i>we'll unearth right away.</i>

05:16.383 --> 05:19.584
Hewlett:
<i>Unfortunately, that means</i>
<i>those not long deceased.</i>

05:19.586 --> 05:22.421
I'll do it.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.756
I'll do it.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.428
I can help you
choose the names

05:29.430 --> 05:32.397
that will cause
the least...

05:32.399 --> 05:34.566
protest.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.935
If you insist.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.639
How long to secure
the cannons?

05:40.641 --> 05:44.810
Two days to raise them,
another to make them fast.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.579
You have three days.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.915
Godspeed, Richard.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.356
<i>â™ª Hush, hush </i>

05:57.358 --> 05:59.057
<i>â™ª There's snakes</i>
<i>in the garden... â™ª</i>

05:59.059 --> 06:02.861
<i>â™ª Soul for sale... </i>

06:02.863 --> 06:05.097
<i>â™ª Blood on the rise </i>

06:06.833 --> 06:09.101
<i>â™ª Hush, hush </i>

06:09.103 --> 06:12.871
- <i>â™ª I can't wait anymore  </i>
<i>-</i> <i>â™ª Soul for sale... </i>

06:14.774 --> 06:18.143
<i>â™ª I can't wait anymore </i>

06:21.447 --> 06:24.149
<i>â™ª Hush, hush. </i>

06:25.485 --> 06:27.853
Caleb:
Court-martial, huh?
Busy boy.

06:27.855 --> 06:31.156
General Scott's
relegated me to secretary
in the meantime.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.825
I just hope
he'll heed this.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.628
It's too long.
If the scout has
anything to say,

06:36.630 --> 06:39.164
he keeps it brief.
Otherwise he rambles

06:39.166 --> 06:42.067
or, at worst,
gives an opinion.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.035
Sir, I grant you
I care little
for sauerkraut

06:44.037 --> 06:45.570
or Hessians,
for that matter.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.440
But if German mercenaries
are in Trenton,

06:48.442 --> 06:50.509
then the British
are surely not.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.044
Now, don't you think
General Washington should
want to know that?

06:58.117 --> 07:00.585
This is unsigned.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.788
Who spoke
to these Hessians?

07:04.957 --> 07:06.758
You?

07:06.760 --> 07:10.128
We swore he would
remain nameless, sir.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.031
Captain Tallmadge?

07:16.736 --> 07:19.571
The source is true,
sir, and trustworthy,

07:19.573 --> 07:21.773
but we swore his name
would be kept secret.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.710
If you cannot trust me,
your superior officer,
then I cannot trust you.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.547
And I certainly
will not trust this.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.816
Burn it.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.834
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, shh.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.511
This'll end
in violence.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.813
Violence
is what began it.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.850
It was one scout.
Not even a scout.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.085
It was more likely
a boat thief--

08:07.087 --> 08:09.554
-  <i>hungry and desperate. </i>
<i>- You don't know that.</i>

08:11.057 --> 08:14.726
I don't see why the rebels
would attack Setauket.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.528
By all reports,
they're on retreat

08:16.530 --> 08:18.663
and we're well behind
British lines here.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.799
This town has always
been loyal to the Crown
and they hate us for that.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.168
- They don't hate us.
They hate--
- Why do you defend them?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.204
I'm not defending them.
I'm defending you.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.673
Look, I'm telling you,
if you write that list,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.509
the town will turn
against you.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.010
Not Hewlett, you.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.546
Hewlett will take the stones
whether I counsel him or not.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.948
Well, then, let him.

08:36.950 --> 08:41.553
To tear a gravestone,
any gravestone,

08:41.554 --> 08:43.554
from where it sits
is an act of evil.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.757
No amount of wisdom
can make that just.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.693
To shoulder
a burden is my way,
to run from it yours.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.997
Look, I'm not running
anywhere, all right?
I'm trying to help you.

08:54.667 --> 08:58.069
Then why don't you help me
in the way you seem
to find hardest--

08:58.071 --> 09:00.906
being a loyal son?

09:04.677 --> 09:06.845
When the town
hears about this,
my opinion won't matter.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.713
The town
won't hear of anything

09:08.715 --> 09:11.650
until I am prepared
to present the names.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.793
Andre:
<i>Do it again.</i>

09:21.795 --> 09:23.328
Tell me your name.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.797
<i>( music playing )</i>

09:31.103 --> 09:33.338
I am Miss Iris Endicott,

09:33.340 --> 09:35.874
native to Basking Ridge,
New Jersey.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.877
Tavern wench
of the Traveler's Rest.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.313
Ooh.

09:41.315 --> 09:44.349
Mm, well done.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.652
You've taken
your character to heart.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.221
Well, it's easy to play
the trollop with you, Major.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.024
As for my next partner,

09:53.026 --> 09:55.026
I fear I'll be
less convincing.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.296
I promise you,
if you play the wench,

09:58.298 --> 10:00.332
he will play the fool.

10:00.334 --> 10:04.369
Such intrigue
for a man who's already
one of your spies.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.176
One who I've never met before
and have reason to doubt,

10:11.178 --> 10:13.945
and yet the advantage
is ours.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.381
He's never seen me.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.317
And he will never
suspect you.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.658
<i>( Philomena laughing,</i>
<i>squealing )</i>

10:30.029 --> 10:33.264
Where's my Iris?

10:33.266 --> 10:36.801
Mm, I can smell
my flower.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.970
Reporting
for duty, General.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.408
( chuckles )

10:43.410 --> 10:45.710
I catch the scent.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.879
Give me a taste.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.881
If you can find me.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.751
( grunts )

10:52.753 --> 10:54.219
( squeals )

10:54.221 --> 10:56.755
<i>( chuckles )</i>

10:58.124 --> 10:59.424
Marco.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.092
Polo.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.897
Marco.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.432
Polo.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.839
Marco.

Polo.

11:19.979 --> 11:23.848
( laughing )

11:24.850 --> 11:26.918
Marco.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.286
Polo.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.792
Evening, General.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.478
We just got him
off to sleep.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.213
( whispering )
We'll be silent
as Quakers.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.789
Hearing you talk
about your brother,

12:04.791 --> 12:07.292
how much you loved him,
how much you miss him...

12:07.294 --> 12:09.327
I don't want
Thomas to be alone.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.162
I want to give him
a brother.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.935
Tell me what you want.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.970
I can be
what you want.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.858
If you have something
to tell, tell it.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.395
There should be
no secrets between us.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.533
If there's another
in your thoughts, then...

12:56.809 --> 12:59.444
( whispering )
Mary

12:59.446 --> 13:02.347
if I tell you
what troubles me...

13:02.349 --> 13:05.817
you'll have to promise me
you'll keep it quiet.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.419
Promise me.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.958
( clicking )

13:22.434 --> 13:26.304
You can only imagine
what a blacksmith's
house looks like

13:26.306 --> 13:28.039
without a woman around.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.342
So Mrs. Hallock
has loaned him her
slave Zipporah

13:31.344 --> 13:33.545
<i>to cook and clean</i>
<i>until he finds a wife.</i>

13:33.547 --> 13:37.549
Mr. Shelton's not
the only man who could
use a wife, I'd say.

13:37.551 --> 13:40.118
Your father-in-law,
for instance.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.422
Judge Woodhull always says
he's married to the town.

13:47.126 --> 13:50.261
( quietly )
I'm not sure the town
will stay married to him.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.998
What do you mean, dear?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.334
( clicking stops )

13:59.038 --> 14:01.172
Nothing.

14:04.009 --> 14:08.379
It's not nothing.
It's a real shame
what he's doing.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.882
Very serious,
indeed.

14:10.884 --> 14:14.552
I feel
the same way you do.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.955
You've-- you've
heard about it?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.057
We hear
all the rumors.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.193
It's a terrible position
that he's put himself in.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.128
Yes.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.564
Why don't you tell us
how you came upon it,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.433
in your own words?

14:33.038 --> 14:37.242
I am an officer
of the Continental Army.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.178
No, you are a deserter

14:40.180 --> 14:42.113
from His Majesty's
Royal Militia.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.249
( sobbing )

14:51.523 --> 14:55.493
I demand an audience
with General Howe.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.496
Oh, we can't take you
to New York.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.331
All the trees
have been cut down.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.600
I'll have to hang you
right here.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.039
And the girl?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.441
The King's Army will make
use of her, I assure you.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.443
- Take her away.
- No, no please.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.946
- Let her be. Let her be!
- No! No, no, please!

15:14.948 --> 15:19.217
No, no, let me go!
General, help me!

15:19.219 --> 15:22.553
No! Ow, you're
hurting me!

15:22.555 --> 15:24.656
No!

15:24.658 --> 15:27.425
<i>General, help!</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:31.562
A man in your position
is privy to a great deal
of intelligence.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.331
Were you to provide it,

15:33.333 --> 15:36.567
I might reconsider
what I intend to do.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.537
Philomena:
<i>No!</i>

15:39.539 --> 15:44.175
I've already provided
your side with information.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.111
( laughs )
Oh, you did, did you?

15:47.113 --> 15:50.415
As a gesture
of good faith.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.418
The destination

15:53.420 --> 15:55.620
of a Connecticut
dragoon patrol.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.189
<i>( Philomena screaming )</i>

15:59.558 --> 16:03.161
I also provided

16:03.163 --> 16:05.730
the location
of a safe house

16:05.732 --> 16:09.400
<i>for small arms</i>
<i>and powder.</i>

16:10.402 --> 16:13.004
A safe house?

16:14.406 --> 16:18.710
The men who raided
that safe house were
led into an ambush.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.079
You sold them out.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.114
<i>( Philomena screams )</i>

16:23.116 --> 16:25.650
I assure you,
I had no idea.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.019
And now you're
playing me falsely.

16:28.021 --> 16:31.723
I give you my word
as an officer and a gentleman.

16:33.525 --> 16:37.628
No, you are
a traitor and a spy.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.065
If not for my sake,
then hers.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.435
<i>( Philomena crying )</i>

16:44.437 --> 16:47.505
( screaming )

16:48.574 --> 16:51.075
No, stop!

16:51.077 --> 16:53.077
- <i>No! </i>
<i>-</i> <i>( platters clatter )</i>

16:53.079 --> 16:54.645
What was the name
of the officer you
corresponded with?

16:59.051 --> 17:02.353
- His name was
Major John--
- <i>Andre?</i>

17:04.022 --> 17:07.090
It's a pleasure to meet
you in person, General.

17:07.093 --> 17:10.560
I do apologize
for all this,

17:10.563 --> 17:12.296
but I had to be sure you
were telling the truth.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.765
<i>( Philomena screaming )</i>

17:13.767 --> 17:16.401
"Let us love good boys
and play with none

17:16.403 --> 17:18.469
that lie
or swear or steal

17:18.471 --> 17:22.440
for fear we will learn
their ways and be
as bad as them.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.275
Amen."

17:26.744 --> 17:28.613
Amen.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.483
<i>( distant chatter )</i>

17:34.653 --> 17:36.554
Man:
<i>It's not right!</i>

17:36.556 --> 17:38.489
<i>These are hallow</i>
<i>grounds.</i>

17:38.491 --> 17:40.358
Mary:
<i>What is it?</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:43.661
Abe:
<i>It's half the town,</i>
<i>by the looks of it.</i>

17:43.663 --> 17:46.697
What are they doing headed
up the road at this hour?

17:51.136 --> 17:53.438
I think I know.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.644
They're going
to your father's.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.180
What?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.549
- How did they find out?
- I let it slip.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.785
Abraham, I'm sorry.

18:20.799 --> 18:24.302
You there, halt!
Stand fast!

18:26.271 --> 18:28.206
Wait, wait, wait.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.743
<i>They've come to see me,</i>
<i>not the major.</i>

18:32.745 --> 18:36.180
This is too many people.
Disperse at once!

18:36.182 --> 18:39.617
- We demand an audience.
- They just want to talk.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.186
I invited them.

18:45.591 --> 18:48.192
Gentlemen,
glad you could come.

18:48.194 --> 18:51.829
Is it true you mean to rip
out all our gravestones?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.464
- Soldier: <i>Sir, should I-- </i>
<i>- Shh, shh.</i>

18:53.466 --> 18:55.233
Richard: <i>No, no.</i>
<i>Where did you hear that?</i>

18:55.235 --> 18:56.734
Everyone knows, Judge.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.236
Slip out the back.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.805
Take Bucephalus
from the barn, quietly.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.375
Ride to the church
and inform Lieutenant
Wakefield to muster the troop.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.610
Richard:
<i>10 stones.</i>

19:05.612 --> 19:09.280
Richard:
<i>They are necessary</i>
<i>for the defense of the town.</i>

19:09.282 --> 19:11.549
Maarten:
<i>You mean defense</i>
<i>of the garrison.</i>

19:11.551 --> 19:13.784
Richard:
<i>The garrison shields us</i>
<i>from attack.</i>

19:13.786 --> 19:18.189
Listen, this is being done
for you, for us.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.790
<i>Just as our town fathers</i>
<i>shielded us</i>

19:19.792 --> 19:22.393
<i>from the Nesaquake</i>
<i>and from the Dutch.</i>

19:22.395 --> 19:24.395
But they never used
our dead to do it.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.464
We--

19:26.466 --> 19:28.900
the stones
of the founders
will not be touched,

19:28.902 --> 19:30.635
I can promise
you that.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.938
Nor of men who
gave their lives
for the Crown.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.907
Nor the stones
of women.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.875
Well done, Woodhull.
You've kept the souls

19:37.877 --> 19:40.278
of your wife and child
off the chopping block.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.413
Abe:
<i>He's protecting</i>
<i>your families as well.</i>

19:43.649 --> 19:45.883
Do you think
he wants to do this?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.719
Do you think you could
choose any better?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.755
Who has he chosen so far?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.623
Richard:
<i>The list is not complete.</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:55.560
- What gives you the right?
- I am the magistrate!

19:55.562 --> 19:57.628
How is this law?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.765
- This is a sacrilege.
- You ain't taking
my stone, Judge!

20:00.767 --> 20:03.668
No stones will be taken
without consent.

20:07.673 --> 20:11.876
The heads of the families
must agree to give,

20:11.878 --> 20:15.346
<i>and since the giving</i>
<i>will mean they are protecting</i>

20:15.348 --> 20:18.216
their loved ones
and their homes,

20:18.218 --> 20:21.519
I expect they will
rise to it.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.859
Now, it is very late
and I am tired.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.329
Good night, gentlemen.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.606
You've done
the right thing.

21:15.608 --> 21:20.011
No, all I've done
is take a difficult task

21:20.013 --> 21:21.979
and made it impossible.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.525
You know, Ben, there still
may be a way to get Abe's
letter to Washington.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.294
- But you've
gotta be all for it.
- The letter?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.529
- Scott burned the letter.
- So you rewrite it.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.764
And then we
smuggle it in.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.632
- Smuggle it?
- Yeah.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.769
- Oh, right.
- I mean, come on,
you saw yourself.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.071
Scott only reads
the first page
of a scout's report

21:47.073 --> 21:49.540
- before passing
it on, right?
- Yeah.

21:49.542 --> 21:53.644
So we get Abe's letter
and we fold it into
a report, yeah?

21:53.646 --> 21:56.947
And then watch it sail
right into Georgie's hands.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.684
I've just finished
my interrogation of
the returning scouts.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.686
There's no single report
worthy of passing on.

22:01.688 --> 22:05.356
Right, so we
beef it up, huh?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.325
- Add a little excitement.
- You mean falsify it.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.560
Yeah, well, insubordination
is your best quality.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.562
( laughs )

22:12.864 --> 22:14.498
It's been
far too long, Richard.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.434
I agree,
and I apologize,

22:16.436 --> 22:19.704
but since the arrival
of our guests from
the Royal Army,

22:19.706 --> 22:21.972
I've had little time
to pay social calls.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.741
Is that what this is?

22:23.743 --> 22:27.445
Lucinda, your family's
strong allegiance to the Crown

22:27.447 --> 22:31.916
has always been
the very anchor
of Setauket.

22:31.918 --> 22:34.051
This town
looks to the Scudders

22:34.053 --> 22:36.087
for moral guidance,

22:36.089 --> 22:39.557
for leadership,
for inspiration, even.

22:39.559 --> 22:43.561
Were you to donate
a gravestone for
the common defense,

22:43.563 --> 22:47.665
I believe it would
inspire the other families
to see the light.

22:47.667 --> 22:51.369
Have you gone mad?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.971
The people here
aren't against this because
their hearts are hard.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.940
It's a bad idea
and they know it,

22:55.942 --> 22:57.908
<i>and I think</i>
<i>you know it, too.</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:00.578
I have tried to reason
with Major Hewlett,
believe me.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.980
I'm sure you have,
Richard.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.549
But you cannot reason
with someone who is
being irrational,

23:05.551 --> 23:07.785
whether it be
the rebels or the major.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.522
But once the decision
has been made, surely
it is our--

23:11.524 --> 23:14.592
I am not going
to bail you out,
Your Honor.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.993
But I will
give you some advice,

23:15.995 --> 23:18.729
which I hope
inspires some reason.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.965
If you forge ahead
with this,

23:20.967 --> 23:24.101
you may as well
dig your own grave.

23:42.888 --> 23:45.156
( sighs )

23:52.831 --> 23:54.999
Maarten: <i>Mr. Woodhull.</i>

23:56.601 --> 24:00.171
I have a little apple
to peel with your father.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.873
Well, he doesn't
live here, Mr. DeJong.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.510
Yeah, he likes to hide
behind the major.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.981
<i>But that won't save him</i>
<i>when judgment comes.</i>

24:10.983 --> 24:12.850
Come again?

24:12.852 --> 24:15.653
Our message is thus--

24:15.655 --> 24:18.722
if he tries
to take our stones,

24:18.724 --> 24:21.125
we will defend them.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.228
You made that
very clear last night.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.164
When my father
gives his word,
he means it.

24:27.166 --> 24:31.068
The devil may sound
reasonable at first,
but it's always a trick.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.638
Go home, Maarten.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.242
I have family
in New York.

24:38.244 --> 24:42.146
They could make it
difficult for the judge's
business there.

24:42.148 --> 24:46.083
My father's business
is with the King's Army,
so I doubt that.

24:46.085 --> 24:49.854
It's a long way between
Setauket and York City

24:49.856 --> 24:53.724
and there's a lot
of trouble on that road.

24:56.127 --> 24:58.896
A man could get robbed.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.798
Or even killed.

25:06.738 --> 25:10.774
You threaten
my father again,
I'll kill you myself...

25:10.776 --> 25:12.276
on this road.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.245
You hear me?

25:17.249 --> 25:20.117
My quarrel
was with your father.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.991
Now it is
with you as well.

25:27.826 --> 25:31.161
<i>You're both damned.</i>

25:39.938 --> 25:42.039
What do you
want me to write?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.175
So, we were burning boats
at night-- you were--

25:45.177 --> 25:48.312
uh, so we say that
the flames

25:48.314 --> 25:50.180
were spotted
by an enemy patrol.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.049
Your move.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.285
How could I see them
in the dark?

25:54.287 --> 25:57.755
( scoffs )
Don't make me give you
a dowse in the chops, boy.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.124
Write what I say.
I need it to get
to Washington.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.926
I need to stay
out of the brig.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.694
No, here's what
you're going to write.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.263
"I came across a Loyalist
militia on the bank
of the river.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.198
I exchanged fire with them,
but was outnumbered

26:08.200 --> 26:11.201
so I dove into the icy water
to avoid their shots,

26:11.203 --> 26:13.337
<i>swam downriver,</i>
<i>hid in the bushes all night,</i>

26:13.339 --> 26:15.272
<i>which is how</i>
<i>I caught frostbite.</i>

26:15.274 --> 26:18.175
Finally, they boarded
their boats and withdrew
across the Delaware.

26:18.177 --> 26:22.813
From my vantage point,
I could make out five men
and one officer."

26:22.815 --> 26:24.615
King me.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.919
Is that legal?

26:46.304 --> 26:49.139
So, we fold Abe's letter
inside Ezra's report

26:49.141 --> 26:51.909
and we watch it
sail away to Washington
like a stowaway.

26:51.911 --> 26:54.345
Ben:
<i>Stowaways get tossed</i>
<i>overboard, Caleb.</i>

27:03.121 --> 27:05.956
"Swam downstream
and hid in the bushes
all night.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.826
That's how
I caught frostbite.

27:08.828 --> 27:12.129
Finally, they boarded
their boat

27:12.131 --> 27:14.732
<i>and withdrew</i>
<i>across the Delaware.</i>

27:14.734 --> 27:16.200
<i>From my vantage point,</i>
<i>I could make out</i>

27:16.202 --> 27:19.370
five men
and one officer."

27:19.372 --> 27:22.006
Too small for
a foraging party.
Most likely scouts.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.342
Washington fears
that General Howe

27:25.344 --> 27:26.710
will ford the river
to strike at us.

27:26.712 --> 27:28.278
He'll want
to ponder this.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.818
This is the kind
of intelligence

27:34.820 --> 27:36.420
you should've
been bringing me.

27:43.361 --> 27:48.165
Richard, you've hardly
left your study
once this day.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.034
Come and join me
for dinner.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.369
Major, this task...

27:52.371 --> 27:55.406
has proved more difficult
than I had expected,

27:55.408 --> 27:58.242
<i>owing to the sentiments</i>
<i>of the people.</i>

27:58.244 --> 28:00.878
You've appeased
them, Richard.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.780
You have coddled them.

28:02.782 --> 28:06.116
<i>And yet somehow you're</i>
<i>surprised when they act</i>
<i>like children.</i>

28:06.118 --> 28:08.452
The stones are
for their defense.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.755
If the rebels take
the town, then they
will be victims, too,

28:11.757 --> 28:15.325
of murder, of rape,
and of pillage.

28:15.327 --> 28:19.463
They fear damnation
as much as they fear
the rebels.

28:19.465 --> 28:23.467
They see this
as a reproach
against God.

28:23.469 --> 28:27.204
Romans 13--
"The powers that be
are ordained by God."

28:27.206 --> 28:29.773
<i>Our king</i>
<i>was ordained by God</i>

28:29.775 --> 28:32.910
and I was appointed
to my duty by our king.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.212
You may well speak for God,
but I do not.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.914
At least, that's not
the way the people see it.

28:36.916 --> 28:40.417
I need more time.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.821
I'm not going
to indulge you, Richard.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.124
<i>If I don't have</i>
<i>a list of names</i>
<i>by tomorrow morning,</i>

28:47.126 --> 28:50.227
then Appleton will
choose the best ones.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.815
-  <i>( thunder rumbling ) </i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( horse whinnies )</i>

29:18.857 --> 29:21.191
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

29:30.502 --> 29:32.336
Where are you going?

29:35.240 --> 29:37.141
My father's.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.278
But it's starting to rain.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.015
There's something
I got to tell him.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.986
Something that'll
put a stop to all this.

29:50.054 --> 29:52.422
What could you possibly
say that would--

29:54.993 --> 29:57.961
Something I should have
said three days ago.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.099
<i>( door closes )</i>

30:03.334 --> 30:05.302
( chuckles )

30:08.373 --> 30:11.241
- Ready?
- Yes.

30:12.510 --> 30:16.280
( sobbing )

30:16.282 --> 30:17.514
Iris.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.416
Oh, General.
Thank God you're alive.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.951
( screams )

30:20.953 --> 30:23.053
- Iris! Iris!
- No!

30:23.055 --> 30:25.022
Bastard.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.829
<i>( Philomena wailing )</i>

30:31.831 --> 30:33.931
We may not be allies,

30:33.933 --> 30:36.533
but we share
a common enemy.

30:36.535 --> 30:39.036
"To Mr. John Hancock,

30:39.038 --> 30:41.071
President of
the Continental Congress.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.040
Sir, <i>entre nous,</i>

30:43.042 --> 30:45.409
a certain great man
is most damnably deficient.

30:45.411 --> 30:49.213
General Washington
is not fit to command
a sergeant's guard."

30:49.215 --> 30:50.981
How did you get that?

30:50.983 --> 30:52.916
You think
you're the sole rebel
I correspond with?

30:55.320 --> 30:57.921
You wrote this letter
for the same reason
you wrote to me.

30:57.923 --> 31:00.357
You believe you should
be commander instead
of Washington.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.459
And I agree.

31:02.461 --> 31:06.096
This capture
is my gift to you.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.332
Your gift?

31:08.334 --> 31:11.935
You won't be blamed
when half the army walks
out come the new year.

31:11.937 --> 31:15.906
Which is when General
Charles Lee heroically
escapes captivity

31:15.908 --> 31:18.275
and fights his way back
to the Continental lines.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.911
The Congress will
clamor for the hero

31:20.913 --> 31:23.380
who would pull off
such a daring feat.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.183
( scoffs )

31:26.185 --> 31:28.652
Come the spring...

31:28.654 --> 31:32.656
you will advise
Congress...

31:36.060 --> 31:38.128
to sue for peace.

31:38.130 --> 31:42.499
So I'll be in charge
of our surrender?

31:45.003 --> 31:47.638
Then Crown and Colonies
are reunited

31:47.640 --> 31:51.408
and this terrible
conflict is over.

31:59.951 --> 32:03.287
To the next commander-in-chief
of the Continental Army.

32:09.227 --> 32:12.162
- <i>( rain pattering ) </i>
<i>- ( shivers )</i>

32:12.164 --> 32:14.231
Thanks.

32:16.501 --> 32:19.169
There you are.
Thanks.

32:31.582 --> 32:35.452
Richard:
Do you think hell exists
in more than one place?

32:37.322 --> 32:39.456
What does the Bible say?

32:40.491 --> 32:42.693
It is silent...

32:42.695 --> 32:47.030
as are these books of law,
books of wisdom.

32:48.566 --> 32:52.336
There are no answers
to my question.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.438
No, there's always
an answer.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.073
Hmm.

32:59.444 --> 33:02.312
Father,

33:02.314 --> 33:04.214
if Major Hewlett
were convinced

33:04.216 --> 33:07.184
that there was
no immediate threat
to the town,

33:07.186 --> 33:10.420
then there would be
no need to bolster
the earthworks.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.289
But he is convinced.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.092
But...

33:15.094 --> 33:19.262
if the rebels
were preparing
to attack Setauket,

33:19.264 --> 33:23.233
surely their scout would
do everything he could
to avoid detection.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.303
I mean, what sort of spy
reveals himself?

33:26.305 --> 33:28.739
You think I haven't
considered that?

33:28.741 --> 33:30.707
You try telling that
to Hewlett!

33:30.709 --> 33:32.776
Shh, shh,
lower your voice.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.245
I don't know which
is worse, his lack
of military experience

33:35.247 --> 33:37.581
or his delusions
of grandeur.

33:37.583 --> 33:41.251
To fortify the church is rash,
to use the headstones folly.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.653
He's been obstinate,
capricious.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.522
You mean he's acted
like a king.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.095
You have been compelled
to do something

33:52.097 --> 33:54.531
that is unjust,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.767
and when a man
is compelled to do
something,

33:56.769 --> 33:59.236
- he either submits or--
- He rebels.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.606
Right, and so you saw
for yourself,

34:02.608 --> 34:05.142
the people
are against this.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.210
They will be there
tomorrow and they will
outnumber the soldiers.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.781
- So?
- So, then lead them.

34:10.783 --> 34:14.518
Tell Hewlett
that it can't be done
or they'll revolt.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.719
Call his bluff
and he will back down.

34:16.722 --> 34:20.157
- I'm not gonna lead a revolt.
- It's not a revolt.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.494
It's just you
standing your ground.

34:24.496 --> 34:28.130
You won't be made
to sacrifice your honor.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.132
And what about
the major's honor?

34:30.135 --> 34:32.135
Why would he yield?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.806
Let me ask you...

34:36.809 --> 34:39.409
why is he doing this?

34:39.411 --> 34:43.179
- Above all else?
- He doesn't want to
lose the town.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.687
Right.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.125
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

34:56.793 --> 34:59.596
Uh-huh.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.207
He used to sit there.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.775
Thomas.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.477
I know.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.745
( chuckles )

35:20.885 --> 35:24.488
I think that's enough
for one night, huh?
Don't you?

35:24.490 --> 35:25.889
Come on.
Come on, then.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.757
( groans )

35:31.129 --> 35:33.763
- He used to sit there,
you know?
- I know.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.199
I used to spy on you both
from that window.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.435
He had such
a perceptive mind,

35:38.437 --> 35:42.339
like a--
like a clear lake.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.576
His questions
were like answers, too.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.516
Come on.
Come on.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.691
There you go.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.793
Thomas.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.445
Ben:
<i>Well, we'll be heroes</i>
<i>or we'll be hanged.</i>

36:22.447 --> 36:24.915
It ain't treason
if there's good reason.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.484
( laughs )

36:29.287 --> 36:31.655
Ben:
<i>I just hope</i>
<i>Washington reads it.</i>

36:31.657 --> 36:33.924
To the general's
attention, sir.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.359
Caleb:
<i>What else has he</i>
<i>got to do?</i>

36:55.446 --> 36:58.815
Soldier:
<i>Just the stones, men.</i>
<i>Leave the bodies be.</i>

37:06.857 --> 37:09.593
Thank you.
Thank you, son.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.995
Bless you.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.997
Thank you.

37:32.783 --> 37:35.852
( loud muttering )

37:46.564 --> 37:48.832
Proceed no further.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.637
<i>This is</i>
<i>an illegal assembly.</i>

38:03.047 --> 38:06.483
Soldier:
You may not gather here.
Return to the village.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.671
Soldier:
Stand back.

38:43.354 --> 38:46.790
When Major Hewlett
first proposed this plan,

38:46.792 --> 38:48.825
I was against it.

38:51.362 --> 38:54.064
Now I must disappoint
the major yet again.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.436
I have no stones
to give him.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.971
( murmuring )

39:06.477 --> 39:08.545
My fault...

39:11.048 --> 39:14.417
was not in asking
too much of you,
but too little.

39:16.954 --> 39:20.423
We have failed to consider
what's most important here.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.993
Not what we want
or what the major wants.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.596
But what God wants.

39:29.433 --> 39:32.836
And what He demands
is sacrifice as
a test of faith.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.538
<i>For faith</i>
<i>without works is dead.</i>

39:35.540 --> 39:38.007
Abraham understood this

39:38.009 --> 39:40.977
<i>when he brought Isaac</i>
<i>to the mountain.</i>

39:43.013 --> 39:46.082
And we must
follow his example...

39:49.720 --> 39:52.555
and offer up that which
we hold most dear,

39:52.557 --> 39:55.959
that which we would
never sacrifice.

39:55.961 --> 39:59.562
Just as God sacrificed
His only son

39:59.564 --> 40:01.765
to save us all.

41:21.111 --> 41:24.681
Please ask your father
to forgive me.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.685
Ask him yourself.

41:53.811 --> 41:56.746
Pay attention,
Appleton.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.249
This is why I
picked gravestones.

41:59.251 --> 42:03.653
<i>If it was this hard</i>
<i>for the Loyalists</i>
<i>to give them up,</i>

42:03.655 --> 42:05.288
imagine how hard
it will be

42:05.290 --> 42:08.958
for rebels
from the same region
to fire upon them.

42:17.902 --> 42:20.904
This is how you
tame a colony.

42:20.906 --> 42:24.107
Not through battle...

42:24.109 --> 42:27.577
<i>but through winning</i>
<i>their hearts and minds.</i>

42:32.650 --> 42:35.652
<i>( theme music playing )</i>
