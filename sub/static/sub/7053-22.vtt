WEBVTT

00:00.435 --> 00:01.769
<i>Fringe...</i>

00:01.835 --> 00:02.969
When we were in jacksonville,

00:03.038 --> 00:04.838
There was a pie
chart with names.

00:04.906 --> 00:07.474
Yeah, all the kids from
walter and bell's trials.

00:07.541 --> 00:11.610
I made a list.
Nick lane and james heath.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.690
They were both part
of walter's tests.

00:14.758 --> 00:17.513
Of all the children that
walter and I have prepared,

00:17.581 --> 00:18.715
You are the strongest.

00:18.783 --> 00:21.483
The storm is coming,
and when it is over,

00:21.551 --> 00:23.544
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.202
I'm not from here, am I?

00:25.270 --> 00:27.937
You didn't just open up a
hole to the other side.

00:28.004 --> 00:29.815
<i>You brought me back.</i>

00:29.893 --> 00:31.702
That's why I can't
remember my childhood.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.121
You were dying.

00:33.189 --> 00:35.639
That's why my mother
committed suicide. She knew.

00:35.707 --> 00:37.756
Walter, peter checked
himself out of the hospital

00:37.823 --> 00:38.763
Three hours ago.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.575
<i>He's gone.</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:48.053
Hello, son.

00:51.037 --> 00:53.881
<i>anomalous energy signature
detected.</i>

00:53.952 --> 00:56.060
<i>Local--brooklyn.</i>

00:56.127 --> 00:58.401
Confirmed-- we've got a breach.

00:58.468 --> 01:00.275
<i>Oh, I was thinking, "hey,</i>

01:00.343 --> 01:02.784
Maybe a slow day,
it being Saturday and all."

01:02.852 --> 01:04.459
No rest for the wicked.

01:04.527 --> 01:05.764
Oh, you're not wicked, charlie.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.711
You just pretend really,
really well.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.253
Somebody playing my song?

01:10.321 --> 01:13.931
<i>class one event, sir.
I can see that. You?</i>

01:13.999 --> 01:16.542
Yes, I can. Clear as day.

01:16.609 --> 01:19.015
okay, people, nap time's over.

01:19.085 --> 01:20.454
Let's go to work.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.405
So exactly how big
would the worms get

01:25.472 --> 01:27.245
If you stopped dosing yourself?

01:27.313 --> 01:28.581
They're not worms.

01:28.649 --> 01:31.221
they're arachnids.

01:31.288 --> 01:33.227
sit rep as follows.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.366
Class-one molecular dissolution.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.005
Numbers show severe
molecular cohesion failure.

01:38.075 --> 01:39.577
This isn't just a little tear.

01:39.645 --> 01:41.047
We got a full-fledged
hole here, people.

01:41.116 --> 01:42.285
Has anything come through it?

01:42.352 --> 01:45.260
No data yet. On site in
less than 60 seconds.

01:45.327 --> 01:46.396
Long as it's not bugs.

01:46.464 --> 01:48.033
Oh, it's probably bugs.

01:49.271 --> 01:51.742
What? Bugs like you.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.147
on my six!

02:01.235 --> 02:04.475
I want science and risk
reports in three minutes.

Site's secure, boss.

02:32.265 --> 02:33.466
Chief, this is bad.

02:33.534 --> 02:35.671
<i>I'm showing stage-three
degradation.</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:37.708
I need data that tells me
this event is contained,

02:37.776 --> 02:39.812
<i>Captain. I'm trying here.</i>

02:41.917 --> 02:43.420
Damn it.

02:43.488 --> 02:45.991
We're in potential
quarantine range here, sir.

02:47.162 --> 02:48.830
Send up a looker, stat.

02:48.898 --> 02:50.934
<i>the looker's being
dispatched now, sir.</i>

02:51.002 --> 02:53.273
Hi. I'm agent dunham
with fringe division.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.844
Could I see your show-me,
please? Sure.

02:55.911 --> 02:57.580
You ain't gonna quarantine
the place, right?

02:57.648 --> 02:59.417
There's nothing to worry about.

02:59.485 --> 03:01.354
But if you could tell
me what you saw--

03:01.422 --> 03:03.792
I mean, even small things
could be important.

03:13.678 --> 03:15.948
I'm getting decreased gravity
measurements here, colonel.

03:19.522 --> 03:21.358
Activating quarantine
potentiator.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.030
Agent farnsworth?

03:25.098 --> 03:26.800
Broyles. Phillip. Colonel.

03:26.868 --> 03:28.237
<i>Risk assessment.</i>

03:28.304 --> 03:30.473
I need to know if this
thing is spreading.

03:33.445 --> 03:34.779
We can't have another
boston, captain.

03:34.847 --> 03:35.814
<i>I know tha</i>

03:35.882 --> 03:38.819
You think I don't know that?

03:38.887 --> 03:41.157
quarantine device unlocked.

03:41.225 --> 03:43.193
Recommendation, agent.

03:43.262 --> 03:45.631
quarantine will result in excess

03:45.699 --> 03:46.866
Of 10,000 casualties.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.001
warning.

03:48.069 --> 03:49.571
One minute to quarantine.

03:49.638 --> 03:51.674
Massive loss of
life will result.

03:51.742 --> 03:52.676
Warning...

03:52.744 --> 03:54.378
Recommendation, agent.

03:54.446 --> 03:56.849
Gravitational and molecular
degeneration are decreasing,

03:56.917 --> 03:58.952
<i>But outside acceptable
parameters.</i>

03:59.020 --> 04:02.157
Recommendation,
agent farnsworth? Calculating.

04:02.225 --> 04:04.160
massive loss of
life will result.

04:04.229 --> 04:06.163
Really? 40 seconds
to quarantine.

04:06.232 --> 04:07.566
Quarantine device unlocked.

04:07.634 --> 04:10.567
God, and I didn't
even update my will.

04:10.635 --> 04:12.869
Massive loss of life will result.
Frank would just spent it all anyway.

04:12.936 --> 04:14.836
30 seconds to quarantine.

04:14.904 --> 04:16.937
Recommendation,
agent farnsworth?

04:26.246 --> 04:30.015
Event is terminating-
no quarantine recommended.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.217
Captain, you are clear.
Do not quarantine.

04:32.285 --> 04:33.651
<i>Repeat-- do not quarantine.</i>

04:33.719 --> 04:35.486
20 seconds to quarantine.

04:35.554 --> 04:37.721
We got to stop doing this.
Warning...

04:39.458 --> 04:41.193
<i>hey, guys.</i>

04:41.259 --> 04:44.330
We got something up here.

04:45.932 --> 04:47.864
I wish it was bugs.

04:49.933 --> 04:51.233
<i>what is that?</i>

04:51.301 --> 04:52.768
these look like carcinomas.

04:52.836 --> 04:54.503
There's no way anyone
could live long enough

04:54.570 --> 04:55.937
To develop tumors this severe.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.405
<i>Witnesses have anything?</i>

04:57.473 --> 04:58.940
The usual--I mean,
they heard a tearing sound.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.275
They saw a blue flash
through the window.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.744
I gave them chips so they
could get radiation scans.

05:03.811 --> 05:05.245
See if he has any I.D.

05:06.747 --> 05:08.013
<i>Guy may have had a
wife and kids</i>

05:08.081 --> 05:10.148
<i>Before the universe sucked him
up and spat him out.</i>

05:10.216 --> 05:11.750
Poor guy.

05:14.486 --> 05:16.487
That's not a show-me.

05:19.257 --> 05:21.792
Okay. Check this out.

05:26.296 --> 05:27.896

Come on, everyone.

05:36.272 --> 05:39.907

06:31.553 --> 06:34.087
I can take you back

06:34.155 --> 06:35.856
<i>They have our coordinates.</i>

06:35.923 --> 06:37.991
<i>But if you come with me,</i>

06:38.058 --> 06:40.860
<i>You won't be able to
come back here.</i>

06:40.927 --> 06:44.096
You have to make a choice,
peter.

06:44.163 --> 06:46.598
<i>let's go.</i>

06:59.978 --> 07:01.913
Thanks.

08:15.107 --> 08:17.373
<i>Hello? Hello, agent dunham.</i>

08:17.440 --> 08:19.006
There--there is something
I am supposed to remember,

08:19.074 --> 08:21.175
And I can'remember what it is,
but it's about peter.

08:21.242 --> 08:23.243
<i>Walter... No, no, no!</i>

08:23.311 --> 08:26.113
<i>I think something is going
to happen to him,</i>

08:26.180 --> 08:27.881
<i>Something...</i>

08:27.949 --> 08:30.149
Something terrible.

08:40.371 --> 08:43.105
I think this is what
I'm supposed to remeer.

08:43.173 --> 08:44.306
Okay.

08:44.374 --> 08:46.073
Well, one of those men-- you know,
the observers--

08:46.141 --> 08:47.775
I think he left it for me.

08:47.842 --> 08:49.776
Well, after I brought
peter from the other side,

08:49.843 --> 08:51.943
Some years later,
one of them came to visit me.

08:52.011 --> 08:54.679
Well--well, he told
me that I had to agree

08:54.746 --> 08:57.614
Toever let peter
return to e other de.

08:57.681 --> 08:58.781
Why?

08:58.849 --> 09:01.350
Because if I did,
this wou happen.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.951
Okay, but what is this,
walter? What does it even mean?

09:04.019 --> 09:06.020
Look, look, it is exactly
what it appes to be. See?

09:06.087 --> 09:10.695
I think my s...

09:10.762 --> 09:14.434
Is going to be responsible
for the end of t world.

09:17.405 --> 09:19.305
Okaylter,
we have  get peter back.

09:19.373 --> 09:21.373
He went off by his
own free will.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.876
But he didn't know about this.

09:22.944 --> 09:24.779
Even if he wand-- walter,
how do we get him back?

09:24.847 --> 09:26.015
We have no way of contacting--

09:26.082 --> 09:28.384
walter!

09:28.451 --> 09:29.919
How?

09:34.288 --> 09:35.788
<i>m sorry, sir, I can't let
you go in the.</i>

09:35.855 --> 09:37.856
This is-- don't
even think about it!

09:42.426 --> 09:43.493
<i>What is this,
phillip? We have reason</i>

09:43.561 --> 09:44.694
To believe your company

09:44.762 --> 09:45.996
Is manufacturing weapons
for the other side.

09:46.064 --> 09:47.532
Oh, that absurd.
I want every piece of data

09:47.567 --> 09:49.034
Even remotely related
to the other universe.

09:49.101 --> 09:50.301
W dare you?
Are you out of your mind?

09:50.369 --> 09:51.902
Stop it, both of you!

09:51.969 --> 09:54.270
Per is in danger.

09:55.605 --> 09:57.505
Walter says that this technology

09:57.573 --> 09:58.974
Has a very specic

09:59.041 --> 10:01.310
<i>And recognizable design.</i>

10:01.378 --> 10:03.946
I dare say nina would agree.

10:04.014 --> 10:05.948
Dear g. What side is this?

10:06.016 --> 10:07.183
Does it matter?

10:08.952 --> 10:11.121
This is william's technology,
but we didn't build it.

10:11.189 --> 10:12.490
<i>Okay, nina, listen to me.</i>

10:12.557 --> 10:16.262
Peter's been taken.
You have to help us cross over.

10:22.335 --> 10:23.334
<i>the thing is,</i>

10:23.402 --> 10:24.802
Get over the,

10:24.870 --> 10:28.639
That'suh, really a misnomer.

10:28.707 --> 10:33.309
In truth, the two
universes are overpping.

10:35.979 --> 10:37.046
<i>And to get to the other side,</i>

10:37.114 --> 10:38.680
<i>Our universe</i>

10:38.748 --> 10:42.517
Needs to pass through you,
literally,

10:42.585 --> 10:45.219
Like--like water passing
through a cheesecloth.

10:45.287 --> 10:49.156
Our cells need to separate
on an atomic level.

10:49.223 --> 10:53.759
The problem is,
when they come back together,

10:53.827 --> 10:58.431
They don't come back together
with the same cohesion.

11:07.304 --> 11:11.072
<i>Somehow, bell managed to
cross back and forth,</i>

11:11.140 --> 11:13.541
<i>Although precisely how,</i>

11:13.608 --> 11:15.509
We can find no record of.

11:15.576 --> 11:19.712
But I suspect that
whatever methodology,

11:19.780 --> 11:22.417
He crossed so many times

11:22.485 --> 11:23.953
That he's become

11:24.020 --> 11:26.054
<i>Like this coffee cup--</i>

11:26.122 --> 11:27.522
Molecularly unstable.

11:27.590 --> 11:31.358
As many atoms in each of us

11:31.426 --> 11:33.795
As there are stars in the sky.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.599
It's why belly never
came back, isn't it?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.366
Because he was scared
that the same thing

11:41.434 --> 11:42.368
Would happen to him.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.803
I don't know.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.938
I've sent him communications,
but if he got them,

11:46.006 --> 11:47.740
He hasn't been able
to communicate to me.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.074
<i>there has to be a way.</i>

11:49.142 --> 11:52.445
What about how you crossed
over when you first got peter?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.280
The last time I opened a door,

11:54.348 --> 11:57.750
It set in motion the ripples
that weaken the very fabric

11:57.817 --> 11:59.884
Of our reality.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.553
To do so again could
instantly shatter

12:02.621 --> 12:04.154
Both worlds...

12:04.222 --> 12:05.322
And likely would.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.324
Brandon, give us a moment.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.394
You know, unlike william,

12:10.461 --> 12:12.462
<i>You have the ability to
cross over safely.</i>

12:12.530 --> 12:15.297
I can't. I-I-I mean,
I-I-I can't control it.

12:15.365 --> 12:17.566
I've--I've flashed
over for a few seconds,

12:17.633 --> 12:20.735
Or bell's pulled me over,
but I-I-I can't control it,

12:20.803 --> 12:21.803
Not on my own.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.671
Not on your own,

12:23.739 --> 12:27.173
But if there were
two or three of you,

12:27.240 --> 12:30.342
A-a-a larger power supy,
as iwere.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.343
I'm not following.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.911
With more cortexiphan children,

12:33.979 --> 12:36.816
Their collective psychic ergy

12:36.884 --> 12:38.484
Could...

12:38.552 --> 12:40.419
You know, belly and
I always agreed

12:40.486 --> 12:42.353
That that primal
part of the brain

12:42.421 --> 12:44.355
Which allows us
to cross universes

12:44.423 --> 12:45.523
Is also responsible

12:45.591 --> 12:48.025
For a host of-
of paranormal activities--

12:48.093 --> 12:52.262
Pyrokinesis, telepathy,
thought control.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.231
And that we all had
these abilities

12:55.299 --> 12:57.400
<i>Until--till there was a
moment in history</i>

12:57.467 --> 13:00.235
<i>When something was done to us,
and--and it was shut down.</i>

13:02.405 --> 13:03.538
I suspect aliens.

13:03.605 --> 13:05.272
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

13:05.340 --> 13:06.506
<i>The only other</i>

13:06.574 --> 13:09.408
Cortexiphan children
that we have located,

13:09.475 --> 13:11.776
They have failed worse.

13:11.844 --> 13:12.943
You...

13:13.011 --> 13:14.811
<i>Are the only one left.</i>

13:16.981 --> 13:20.216
Actually...

13:20.284 --> 13:21.517
She's not.

13:28.852 --> 13:29.785
<i>Performance without compromise.
Unaccounted for.</i>

13:29.852 --> 13:30.986
Prudence dictated we determine

13:31.053 --> 13:32.854
What we might be dealing
with in the future.

13:32.922 --> 13:35.189
So you woke all
three of them up?

13:35.257 --> 13:36.957
Actually, five.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.559
We've tracked down some others.

13:38.627 --> 13:40.227
Okay.

13:40.294 --> 13:41.495
About six weeks ago,

13:41.562 --> 13:42.495
<i>Massive dynamic proposed</i>

13:42.563 --> 13:44.065
<i>A series of experiments</i>

13:44.133 --> 13:46.135
<i>To help them gain control of and
repurpose their abilities.</i>

13:46.203 --> 13:48.706
These three have been
quite successful.

13:48.774 --> 13:50.008
James heath can
now cure disease,

13:50.076 --> 13:51.478
<i>Not cause it.</i>

13:51.545 --> 13:54.314
<i>Sally clark is becoming a fully
functional pyrokinetic.</i>

13:54.382 --> 13:56.249
<i>And your friend nick lane's
empathic transfers</i>

13:56.316 --> 13:57.450
<i>Can now be controlled.</i>

14:09.496 --> 14:10.930
Olive.

14:18.638 --> 14:21.943
Nick.

14:22.011 --> 14:25.681
Very good, baby.

14:25.748 --> 14:27.249
Welcome to the monkey house.

14:45.030 --> 14:47.696
This is new. Who authorized it?

14:47.764 --> 14:49.798
Senate intelligence...

14:49.865 --> 14:51.965
Thanks to peter.

14:52.032 --> 14:53.633
It was part of a list
of demands he gave me

14:53.700 --> 14:57.034
Right before I went
to secure our funding.

14:57.101 --> 14:58.933
<i>This is very mission:
Impossible.</i>

15:01.497 --> 15:03.464
I know you.

15:03.532 --> 15:04.732
You're the man

15:04.800 --> 15:06.567
That experimented on us.

15:06.634 --> 15:09.068
I could kill you
where you stand.

15:09.136 --> 15:11.337
Each of you could.

15:11.405 --> 15:14.006
What I did...

15:14.074 --> 15:17.542
Was inexcusable...

15:17.610 --> 15:18.643
Barbaric.

15:18.711 --> 15:21.545
The collateral damage

15:21.612 --> 15:24.713
Has been extensive.

15:24.781 --> 15:28.516
But know that we
had noble goals.

15:28.584 --> 15:29.751
We believed

15:29.818 --> 15:33.654
That our world needed guardians,

15:33.722 --> 15:34.821
Protectors,

15:34.889 --> 15:37.957
That you children would
be those protectors.

15:38.025 --> 15:41.227
We fostered your talents
because we foresaw

15:41.294 --> 15:43.395
That the day would come

15:43.463 --> 15:47.599
When both universes
would be in jeopardy.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.267
So...

15:49.335 --> 15:50.936
Horrible as it is to say,

15:51.003 --> 15:53.171
Today is the day

15:53.239 --> 15:56.241
For which you were created.

16:00.879 --> 16:03.847
What I could never have imagined

16:03.915 --> 16:07.950
Is that I would be asking you

16:08.018 --> 16:10.086
To help me save  son.

16:16.491 --> 16:19.659
I'm so sorry.

16:22.698 --> 16:26.705
Well, ifone of you
are gonna kill me...

16:29.775 --> 16:32.277
I think I'll go and
have a bit of a cry.

16:36.415 --> 16:40.582
Man, that's not the
same guy I remember.

16:40.650 --> 16:42.385
He's exactly the same.

16:44.521 --> 16:46.121
Dr. Bishop has
identified a likely spot

16:46.188 --> 16:48.723
To attempt a crossover-
brooklyn, new york.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.857
You go at 0800 tomorrow morning.

16:52.258 --> 16:53.657
You might want to get some rest.

16:53.725 --> 16:54.891
<i>hey, fbi guy.</i>

16:54.958 --> 16:58.392
We're about to go
save the world, right?

16:58.460 --> 16:59.859
Two worlds even.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.230
can't we have a night off?

17:11.136 --> 17:13.738
Whatever they want.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.390
Who are you?

17:38.457 --> 17:41.525
I was never lucky, you know?

17:43.594 --> 17:47.262
Sometimes people
need some good luck.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.596
Tonight I guess that's me.

17:51.866 --> 17:53.467
Who else do we have?

17:53.534 --> 18:02.240
* *

18:02.308 --> 18:04.608
Sweet. Hmm.

18:04.675 --> 18:07.509
Me or the strawberry?

18:07.577 --> 18:09.244
Both.

18:11.746 --> 18:14.013
So what would you
like this time--

18:14.081 --> 18:18.617
To feel what I'm feeling
or what you're feeling?

18:18.684 --> 18:20.851
Both.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.345
Please, god...

19:02.499 --> 19:05.097
Aunt liv, what time is it?

19:06.299 --> 19:07.566
It's early.

19:10.536 --> 19:14.572
I have to go on a trip,
and, uh...

19:14.639 --> 19:17.140
I wanted to give you
something before left.

19:20.711 --> 19:21.711
It's pretty.

19:26.550 --> 19:28.584
My mother...

19:28.651 --> 19:31.419
Your grandmother...

19:31.487 --> 19:34.222
Gave it to me before she died.

19:36.491 --> 19:39.859
She told me that it
would keep me safe.

19:43.263 --> 19:44.863
So now I'm giving it to you.

19:47.866 --> 19:49.467
Thanks, aunt liv.

19:51.369 --> 19:55.204
You are welcome, baby girl.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.944
<i>You're up early.</i>

20:04.011 --> 20:05.779
<i>I didn't even hear you
come in last night.</i>

20:05.846 --> 20:08.113
No, I've been working a case.

20:08.181 --> 20:10.114
Think you'll be home for dinner?

20:11.549 --> 20:13.250
I hope so.

20:13.318 --> 20:15.285
I'll call you and let you know.

20:15.353 --> 20:17.420
Okay.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.357
Hey, you okay?

20:23.425 --> 20:26.259
Yeah.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.929
We should do this more often.
It's nice.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.665
Sure.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.110
Look what aunt live gave me.

20:52.086 --> 20:53.353
(broyles even assuming this works-
(broyles even assuming this works--

20:53.421 --> 20:55.155
That you make it
to the other side,

20:55.223 --> 20:57.592
You still have no idea how
you're going to locate peter.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.061
no, but I spoke to nina sharp,

20:59.128 --> 21:00.896
And she sent a message
to william bell

21:00.963 --> 21:02.731
Asking him to meet us
at the grayshot bridge

21:02.798 --> 21:04.198
In central park at 4:00 p.M.

21:04.266 --> 21:05.633
I think he'll help
us find peter.

21:05.701 --> 21:06.934
Dunham...

21:07.002 --> 21:08.935
Massive dynamic didn't
make that weapon over here.

21:09.003 --> 21:11.438
That means bell may have made
it on the other side for them.

21:11.505 --> 21:13.273
No. I trust him.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
In any case,
nina has no confirmation

21:15.142 --> 21:16.976
That bell even gets
her messages. No.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.110
In which case,

21:18.178 --> 21:19.878
You're essentially
invading enemy territory

21:19.946 --> 21:21.046
Without a plan.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.714
You don't know anything
about the opposition,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.848
The landscape...

21:24.916 --> 21:27.584
oh, we're ready.

21:27.652 --> 21:29.986
We're ready to try this.

21:32.189 --> 21:34.356
you can't tell me you
think this is a good idea.

21:34.424 --> 21:36.725
No.

21:36.792 --> 21:40.561
I don't think that
this is a good idea.

21:40.629 --> 21:42.697
Do you got a better one?

21:45.433 --> 21:48.368
it was lovely, wasn't it?

21:48.436 --> 21:49.736
Now...

21:49.803 --> 21:53.272
Faded and broken just like me.

21:55.274 --> 21:58.242
So how does this work, walter?

21:58.310 --> 22:00.644
Remember your shakespeare, dear.

22:00.712 --> 22:05.516
"all the world is a stage"...

22:05.584 --> 22:08.185
Or in this case, both worlds.

22:10.354 --> 22:11.587
You will form a circle.

22:11.655 --> 22:12.855
I-I will stand in the middle,

22:12.923 --> 22:14.457
And I will lead you across.

22:14.524 --> 22:15.691
No.

22:15.759 --> 22:17.026
<i>You can't do this.</i>

22:17.094 --> 22:20.429
Oh, no. No.
He is my son, olivia.

22:20.497 --> 22:21.764
You can't do this.
I won't allow it.

22:21.832 --> 22:24.800
I believe I can.

22:24.868 --> 22:26.502
Or--or else they cannot.

22:28.505 --> 22:31.139
I can't ask them to do something

22:31.207 --> 22:34.409
That I-I'm not willing
to chance myself.

22:41.385 --> 22:43.787
Thank you.

22:43.854 --> 22:45.689
Well, if any of you
have chang your minds,

22:45.756 --> 22:47.623
<i>I will understd.</i>

22:47.690 --> 22:50.819
We were talking about
it on the way over here.

22:50.887 --> 22:53.584
Maybe you did damage us.

22:53.652 --> 22:57.215
But on the other hand,
maybe you made us special.

22:59.385 --> 23:01.520
Fate is a tricky thing.

23:05.828 --> 23:07.395
So, um...

23:07.462 --> 23:09.530
You--you would want to
take a few steps back,

23:09.598 --> 23:11.465
I think, agent broyles.

23:11.532 --> 23:12.932
Olivia.

23:15.702 --> 23:17.936
Now, I want you to
clear your minds

23:18.004 --> 23:19.204
And--and just relax.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.339
All right?

23:20.406 --> 23:21.640
Now, ignore everything

23:21.708 --> 23:24.042
<i>Except the sound of my voice.</i>

23:24.110 --> 23:26.077
Now...

23:26.145 --> 23:27.746
Sp--spread out your arms.

23:27.813 --> 23:29.213
You remember how.

23:29.281 --> 23:31.849
Spread them out to each other.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.116
Yes.

23:34.686 --> 23:35.685
Good.

23:37.321 --> 23:39.489
Now, I want you to think back

23:39.556 --> 23:43.125
To when you were
just young children,

23:43.193 --> 23:47.596
Back to when you were
just young boys and girls.

23:58.274 --> 24:01.042
Think back to when
your imagination

24:01.110 --> 24:05.113
Could--could take you
wherever you wanted to go.

24:09.318 --> 24:13.320
Imagine this universe
slipping away,

24:13.388 --> 24:16.322
Opening like a curtain.

24:16.390 --> 24:20.592
Allow the universe to
pass right through you.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.228
<i>Allow your imagination</i>

24:23.295 --> 24:26.730
<i>To take you to the other side.</i>

24:28.199 --> 24:29.799
james. James.

24:29.867 --> 24:31.200
help me.

24:31.268 --> 24:32.568
Walter, what do we do?

24:32.636 --> 24:33.636
Look...

24:37.470 --> 24:39.267
We made it.

24:49.728 --> 24:51.429
okay, come on, james.

24:51.496 --> 24:52.430
You've got to get up.

24:52.498 --> 24:54.599
<i>We've got to hide now.</i>

24:54.667 --> 24:56.968
Nick... Nick,
I don't feel so good.

24:57.036 --> 24:58.102
Over here.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.504
Come on.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.921
I want science and risk
reports in three minutes.

25:14.456 --> 25:17.524
nick. Nick, make them leave.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.494
I've been trying.
It's not working.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.628
What's wrong with us?

25:23.696 --> 25:26.764
I don't know. Nick, I'm scared.

25:32.737 --> 25:34.371
Check this out.

25:38.877 --> 25:40.377
Who the hell is jackson?

25:40.445 --> 25:42.479
Got a junior?

25:42.547 --> 25:43.714
Yeah.

25:47.019 --> 25:48.652
Going to a strip club later?

25:48.720 --> 25:50.521
Someone's got to
visit your sister.

25:55.226 --> 25:58.963
The paper's real.
The detail is amazing.

26:00.566 --> 26:02.267
Why would someone go to
this kind of trouble?

26:09.475 --> 26:11.075
<i>what in god's name</i>

26:11.143 --> 26:12.343
<i>Did you all find?</i>

26:12.410 --> 26:14.009
Nothing useful. Dead end so far.

26:14.077 --> 26:15.275
Well, whatever it is you scanned

26:15.343 --> 26:17.174
Just raised a red flag
over at the d.O.D.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.441
The secretary wants to see you.

26:22.411 --> 26:23.844
<i>hey, charlie, you ever met him?</i>

26:23.912 --> 26:27.311
I shook his hand once when
I graduated the academy.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.379
What about you?

26:28.447 --> 26:29.647
My dad knew him.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.582
Oh, that explains so much.

26:32.650 --> 26:35.018
Yeah, you don't want to
leak worms all over the guy.

26:35.085 --> 26:36.519
Makes a bad first impression.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.256
They're not worms.

26:39.324 --> 26:41.025
He's waiting for you.
Go ahead in.

26:51.135 --> 26:52.135
Mr. Secretary.

26:54.371 --> 26:56.905
Thank you.

26:56.973 --> 26:58.406
Agent lee...

26:58.474 --> 26:59.907
I'm sorry about your father.

26:59.974 --> 27:01.074
He was a good man. Fine jurist.

27:01.142 --> 27:02.075
Thank you, sir.

27:02.143 --> 27:04.544
And this is your team? Yes, sir.

27:04.611 --> 27:06.746
Agents francis and dunham. Sir.

27:06.813 --> 27:08.581
I understand you're
investigating

27:08.649 --> 27:10.749
A fringe event in brooklyn.

27:10.817 --> 27:12.617
That's correct, sir.
And in this event,

27:12.685 --> 27:14.552
There was a casualty--a man?

27:14.620 --> 27:15.653
That's correct, sir.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.320
So far, we haven't
been able to--

27:17.388 --> 27:18.755
Agent, I believe that
I may have insight

27:18.823 --> 27:22.562
Into who that man is
and where he was from.

27:24.432 --> 27:26.567
What I'm about to tell you

27:26.635 --> 27:28.803
Is classified.

27:28.871 --> 27:31.538
But I think it's time you knew
what you were dealing with.

27:33.074 --> 27:34.574
Agent dunham,
what can you tell me

27:34.642 --> 27:36.577
About the fringe division?

27:36.645 --> 27:40.315
Okay, I' play.

27:40.383 --> 27:41.883
Uh...

27:41.950 --> 27:43.884
The fringe division is a
special adjunct branch

27:43.951 --> 27:45.585
Of the department of defense.

27:45.652 --> 27:48.386
It's primary focus are natural
and environmental disasters

27:48.454 --> 27:50.721
That began in 1985

27:50.789 --> 27:52.756
With the zero event
at reiden lake.

27:52.824 --> 27:54.858
And what are these
natural disasters?

27:54.926 --> 27:57.192
They're holes in the fabric
of the universe, sir.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.627
A-plus.

27:58.695 --> 27:59.995
And how do you know all this?

28:00.063 --> 28:03.598
<i>I know it because I read it
in the zft in 1995</i>

28:03.666 --> 28:05.333
When you wrote and published it.

28:05.401 --> 28:08.604
<i>the zft.</i>

28:10.773 --> 28:12.040
The natural decay

28:12.108 --> 28:14.775
Of our world.

28:14.843 --> 28:15.942
What would you say if I told you

28:16.010 --> 28:17.710
<i>That the zft is a lie</i>

28:17.778 --> 28:20.480
Or a half-truth anyway?

28:20.548 --> 28:22.215
These tears are not natural.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.183
<i>They are the work of man.</i>

28:24.251 --> 28:25.350
<i>These holes</i>

28:25.418 --> 28:29.154
Don't simply lead to nothing.

28:29.222 --> 28:30.688
There is something

28:30.756 --> 28:32.255
On the other side.

28:32.323 --> 28:33.656
What?

28:33.724 --> 28:35.826
Another one. Bravo.

28:35.894 --> 28:39.030
Another what?
Another universe...

28:39.098 --> 28:40.966
A parallel earth just like this,

28:41.033 --> 28:42.901
But slightly different.

28:42.969 --> 28:43.969
And it was their attempt

28:44.036 --> 28:46.538
To penetrate our
world which created

28:46.606 --> 28:49.974
The pattern of destruction
that we struggle with daily.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.474
The $20 bill was--

28:51.542 --> 28:53.908
From the other side,
and so was he.

28:53.975 --> 28:56.041
And I suspect he
didn't come alone.

28:56.109 --> 29:00.709
As you know,
I am not a lover of war.

29:00.777 --> 29:04.344
But I have reason to
believe that these invaders

29:04.412 --> 29:06.846
Are anything but peaceful.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.213
They must be found,

29:09.281 --> 29:11.482
And they must be found quickly.

29:11.549 --> 29:12.749
We'll get them, sir.

29:31.611 --> 29:33.546
<i>Streaming on a single screen.
I'm burning up, nick.</i>

29:35.316 --> 29:38.153
It'll be fine, baby.

29:40.058 --> 29:41.327
Come on.

29:50.572 --> 29:52.539
Scan your I.D., lady.

29:55.142 --> 29:56.441
Sorry.

29:56.509 --> 29:58.544
Uh, we're gonna have to walk.

29:58.611 --> 30:01.146
Central park is 59th street-
that's three miles from here.

30:01.214 --> 30:03.915
Okay, then we
better get started.

31:02.032 --> 31:03.099
Hi.

31:03.166 --> 31:05.000
Hi.

31:05.068 --> 31:06.268
How are you feeling?

31:08.003 --> 31:09.069
I'm okay.

31:09.137 --> 31:12.572
You've been asleep
for three days.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.907
Your fa--

31:16.810 --> 31:19.411
Walter said you might
feel a bit dizzy.

31:19.479 --> 31:20.945
Maybe you'd like to sit down.

31:22.247 --> 31:23.514
I'm okay.

31:28.085 --> 31:29.620
You must be starving.

31:29.687 --> 31:33.023
I made some eggs and bacon.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.826
Do--do you still like bacon?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.728
When you were a boy, we--

31:43.933 --> 31:45.133
I love bacon.

31:52.807 --> 31:55.207
Oh, peter.

32:02.482 --> 32:05.550
Oh, I've missed you so much.

32:22.030 --> 32:23.264
Oh. Stop for a second.

32:23.331 --> 32:26.066
It's fine. I'm fine. Let's go.

32:26.133 --> 32:27.167
You've got to know something.

32:27.234 --> 32:28.735
What the hell is wrong with us?

32:28.802 --> 32:32.270
Oh, I suspect that somehow
the human circuit was flawed.

32:32.338 --> 32:34.573
Did any of you engage in
extreme use of your abilities

32:34.640 --> 32:36.508
<i>Last night-
far more than normal?</i>

32:36.575 --> 32:37.775
No.

32:37.843 --> 32:39.810
Perhaps poor mr. Heath--

32:39.878 --> 32:41.645
You've got to help her. I can't.

32:41.713 --> 32:43.813
But if we're lucky,

32:43.881 --> 32:45.481
Perhaps william bell can.

32:47.851 --> 32:49.318
It's the grand hotel.

32:49.386 --> 32:52.654
They never built it.

32:54.456 --> 32:59.192
Things that might have been
in our world, but weren't.

33:01.061 --> 33:02.095
Come on.

33:02.162 --> 33:04.697
It's not far. Okay.

33:09.802 --> 33:12.437
coffee's quite hard
to come by over here.

33:12.504 --> 33:15.172
It's been rationed
for some time now.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.675
But walter's very
well connected.

33:18.743 --> 33:21.110
It's funny, I..

33:21.178 --> 33:23.245
I never had bacon
when I was growing up.

33:23.313 --> 33:25.547
My mother was vegetarian,
so she never made it.

33:25.615 --> 33:29.483
Until today, I always thought
I imagined having it as a kid.

33:33.587 --> 33:36.254
I'm sorry...

33:36.322 --> 33:38.689
My mother from the other side.

33:43.026 --> 33:44.827
I'm sure you don't want
to hear about that.

33:44.894 --> 33:45.828
No, on the contrary.

33:45.895 --> 33:48.163
I want to hear all
about your childhood.

33:51.501 --> 33:53.436
What's--

33:53.503 --> 33:55.738
Are you close with her still?

33:55.806 --> 33:59.274
I mean...

33:59.342 --> 34:01.777
Did she take good care of you?

34:01.844 --> 34:05.713
She took very good care of me.

34:05.781 --> 34:09.350
But she committed suicide
about ten years ago.

34:12.186 --> 34:13.553
My mother from the other side--

34:13.621 --> 34:16.289
She was wonderful,
but she wasn't strong.

34:18.625 --> 34:21.192
In fact, she was very,
very sad...

34:25.830 --> 34:27.630
Which I suppose
is because of me.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.063
No, listen.

34:29.130 --> 34:32.233
Peter, in the end,

34:32.300 --> 34:33.567
We have to take responsibility

34:33.635 --> 34:37.103
For our own decisions-
the good and the bad.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.943
Your father's going to
be so pleased to see you.

34:45.011 --> 34:48.514
He had said he wanted me
to help him with something.

34:48.581 --> 34:50.451
Yes, he's staying
in the city tonight.

34:50.518 --> 34:52.853
But he asked me
to give you this.

35:01.796 --> 35:03.429
Oh, god.

35:06.366 --> 35:08.801
Look, nick.

35:08.868 --> 35:11.503
These were my favorite.

35:11.571 --> 35:13.104
Can I get one?

35:13.172 --> 35:16.006
<i>I don't think so, baby.
We got to go.</i>

35:16.074 --> 35:20.377
I-I like it here.

35:20.444 --> 35:23.446
Maybe-- maybe we can stay.

35:23.513 --> 35:25.681
nick...

35:27.583 --> 35:29.117
I'm gonna stay.

35:31.586 --> 35:34.688
I know, baby.

35:34.756 --> 35:37.690
I know.

35:37.758 --> 35:40.960
Come on, let's go.

36:07.182 --> 36:09.650
do you see him- william bell?

36:11.853 --> 36:14.454
No.

36:14.522 --> 36:17.923
There's a water fountain.
Come on, I think it'll help.

36:19.493 --> 36:20.826
Are we late?

36:22.662 --> 36:24.163
Maybe he didn't get the message.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.437
No.

36:34.505 --> 36:36.806
Bell has betrayed us.

36:36.873 --> 36:37.807
Run, run, run!

36:42.145 --> 36:43.378
Oh!

36:45.347 --> 36:46.381
<i>don't move!</i>

36:52.187 --> 36:53.320
Walter. Walter!

37:03.962 --> 37:05.563
Nick?

37:05.631 --> 37:09.299
I think I'm staying here.

37:09.367 --> 37:11.501
You stay.

37:11.569 --> 37:14.070
We'll stay together.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.310
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

37:22.378 --> 37:25.746
Step away.

37:25.814 --> 37:29.449
Screw you.

37:36.956 --> 37:38.256
Hey!

37:40.259 --> 37:41.659
<i>man down.</i>

37:41.727 --> 37:45.095
<i>Med team to grayshot bridge.
Man down.</i>

37:58.441 --> 38:01.542
Lincoln?

38:01.610 --> 38:02.610
Liv.

38:02.678 --> 38:05.146
Hey.

38:07.115 --> 38:09.248
Where's the ambulance?

38:37.996 --> 38:40.397
Dizzy...

38:40.465 --> 38:43.900
Must be the onset of
hemorrhagic shock.

38:52.775 --> 38:56.044
But I'm still walking,

38:56.111 --> 39:00.381
So the bullet couldn't
have hit my spinal column.

39:00.449 --> 39:03.584
I'll be perfectly fine.

39:03.652 --> 39:05.119
Excuse me.

39:18.028 --> 39:20.396
Do you really
understand all these?

39:20.464 --> 39:22.865
Maybe.

39:22.932 --> 39:24.766
I'm not sure yet.

39:29.638 --> 39:31.605
Good night, peter.

39:31.673 --> 39:33.507
Good night.

40:13.441 --> 40:15.108
Hey.

40:15.176 --> 40:16.376
Oh. Mm.

40:16.444 --> 40:17.410
I tried to wait up.

40:17.478 --> 40:19.979
Oh, hi, baby.

40:20.047 --> 40:22.047
How is he?

40:22.115 --> 40:24.683
Well, he's got third-degree
burns over 90% of his body.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.350
He's gonna need three months

40:26.418 --> 40:29.155
In a nanite
regeneration chamber,

40:29.223 --> 40:30.590
But he'll live.

40:30.658 --> 40:33.226
I'm sorry-
and on your last night.

40:33.294 --> 40:36.463
I'm going for a week,
not until the end of time. Yeah.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.064
Details.

40:38.132 --> 40:39.666
Might be a good day
to start drinking.

40:39.734 --> 40:42.702
Oh, god. I would if I could
only stand the taste.

40:45.805 --> 40:48.701
So what happened out there?

40:52.438 --> 40:53.438
Just a...

40:53.506 --> 40:57.708
A small anomaly that
set off a fuel cell.

40:57.776 --> 41:01.681
It was just bad luck
of the draw is all.

41:01.749 --> 41:03.552
Come on, no more work.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.620
I know what you need.

41:04.688 --> 41:07.023
yeah? What's that?

41:08.959 --> 41:10.159
Back rub.

41:10.227 --> 41:12.662
Oh, you are a god.

41:12.729 --> 41:14.697
I'll get the oil. Really?

41:17.433 --> 41:19.400
On your last night?

41:19.467 --> 41:21.701
Oh.

41:21.768 --> 41:23.602
I'll take it.

41:26.104 --> 41:28.906
Mm.

41:28.974 --> 41:31.809
Mm.

41:52.661 --> 41:54.262
Hello, olivia.

41:54.330 --> 41:55.664
It's good to see you again.

41:55.732 --> 41:58.200
How--how did you know that I-
I suspected

41:58.268 --> 41:59.702
You would come here.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.337
Okay, so where were
you at the park?

42:01.405 --> 42:02.805
I received nina's message,

42:02.873 --> 42:04.573
But when I got to the park,
it was too late.

42:04.641 --> 42:06.609
There was nothing I could do.

42:06.676 --> 42:10.380
My dear olivia,
I know you have good reason

42:10.448 --> 42:12.516
Not to trust me.

42:12.583 --> 42:14.851
But I'm afraid you're
going to have to.

42:14.918 --> 42:17.152
Walter is in trouble.

42:17.220 --> 42:19.821
And I'm quite confident

42:19.889 --> 42:21.722
We don't have much time.
