-There's a five-year-old child?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.033
You're raising that child?

00:06.100 --> 00:07.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.433
And that's your sister's
biological child?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.200
She was gonna be
put up for adoption.

00:12.266 --> 00:13.734
And you got angry with her?

00:13.800 --> 00:16.700
In my heart,
family needs to stay together,

00:16.767 --> 00:18.700
no matter what it takes.

00:18.767 --> 00:21.600
Um, I don't know
what else to say.

[Kevin] All rise.
Order in the court.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.633
Hello, Judge.
We have case number 1014,

01:00.700 --> 01:01.900
Barrientos versus Villicana.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.900
Thank you.
Have a seat, please.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.967
Ms. Barrientos, the defendant
is your sister?

01:07.033 --> 01:09.133
Yes, ma'am.
My older sister.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.734
[Judy] I want you to explain
something to me

01:10.800 --> 01:13.667
that I'm curious about,
but it also relates to the case.

01:13.734 --> 01:15.066
Otherwise,
I wouldn't go into it.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.767
There's a five-year-old child.

01:16.834 --> 01:17.900
Yes, ma'am.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.033
[Judy] You're
raising that child?

01:19.100 --> 01:20.033
Yes, ma'am.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.033
And that's your sister's
biological child?

01:22.100 --> 01:23.100
[Lillyanna] Yes, ma'am.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.500
[Judy] How long have you been
raising that child?

01:25.567 --> 01:26.433
Since birth.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.700
You have legal guardianship?

01:27.767 --> 01:30.400
Not full.
It's just a power of attorney

01:30.467 --> 01:32.800
in, in the state of Texas.

01:32.867 --> 01:37.433
It's specific, um, granted
powers to take care of her.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.200
But not legal adoption.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.233
Have you applied
for legal adoption?

01:41.300 --> 01:44.066
I've looked into it,
but it's very costly,

01:44.133 --> 01:45.934
and I can't afford that right now.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.533
Who pays for her support?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.633
I do.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.433
[Judy] Can you tell me
the reason why you took

01:50.500 --> 01:52.667
custody of your niece
when she was born?

01:52.734 --> 01:54.100
Because she's family.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.433
She was going to be
put up for adoption.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.266
In my-my heart,
family needs to stay together,

02:00.333 --> 02:01.834
no matter what it takes.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.467
Who is the child's father?

02:03.533 --> 02:05.734
Uh, her-her ex-boyfriend.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.934
Does he see the child regularly?

02:08.000 --> 02:08.967
[Lillyanna] Hmm-mm.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.233
[Judy] Does he pay any support
for the child?

02:10.300 --> 02:11.233
No.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.300
Does he work?

02:12.367 --> 02:13.967
No. He's disabled.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.767
So I guess he gets Social Security.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.400
But he's a good dad to her.

02:18.467 --> 02:22.166
Has he been legally declared
the father of your daughter?

02:22.233 --> 02:23.400
-No.
-[Judy] Why not?

02:23.834 --> 02:25.867
He wasn't at the hospital
when she was born.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.300
He didn't sign her papers
or anything.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.367
But he is her father.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.433
[Judy] Well, if he's disabled,

02:30.500 --> 02:32.066
what's the nature
of his disability?

02:32.133 --> 02:35.500
Um, a pacemaker.
So, limits his ability to work.

02:35.567 --> 02:36.533
How old is he?

02:36.600 --> 02:37.934
Thirty-seven.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.633
Well, I just-- something
for you to explore

02:40.700 --> 02:44.266
so that this child can have
a certain amount of finality

02:44.333 --> 02:46.700
as far as a parent is concerned.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.700
If one of her parents is
getting Social Security disability,

02:50.767 --> 02:52.600
it is possible that

02:52.667 --> 02:56.667
the little girl would be
entitled to Social Security

02:56.734 --> 02:58.934
until she reaches majority.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.500
It's something worthwhile
to look into if you haven't.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.533
Yes, uh, her father
explained that to me.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.000
-[Judy] He did?
-We've already worked through that.

03:05.066 --> 03:05.967
Did you apply?

03:06.033 --> 03:06.967
[Lillyanna] I believe he did.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.066
We didn't really speak up
on the matter.

03:08.133 --> 03:11.200
He just asked me for
some of her vital information,

03:11.266 --> 03:12.934
and I gave it to him.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.333
And he said he would work on it.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.367
Okay. And that would mean
that you would have to

03:17.433 --> 03:19.033
acknowledge that he was
the child's father.

03:19.100 --> 03:19.934
Yes.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.066
[Judy] Okay, good. All right.
Now let's get to this case.

03:22.133 --> 03:24.533
Why don't you tell me
what happened with the car?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.533
So, March 20th,
one of my sisters, other sisters

03:27.600 --> 03:31.233
texts me and she tells me
that Sandi's car was towed.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.967
-[Judy] That's your car?
-Yes.

03:33.033 --> 03:35.433
And I contacted Sandi
this week.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.166
This March 20th
of that week,

03:37.233 --> 03:41.200
I was in school taking midterms.
And I contacted Sandi and asked,

03:41.266 --> 03:43.000
and I told her,
"What happened to your car?"

03:43.066 --> 03:45.133
She said, "It got towed
from my apartment."

03:45.200 --> 03:47.767
And I told her,
"Well, why didn't you tell me?"

03:47.834 --> 03:49.333
The reason why I said
why didn't you tell me

03:49.400 --> 03:52.033
is because, um,
I, I want to help.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.867
You know, I don't want her
to be carless again.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.400
And she said, "Well,
I don't know why I didn't."

03:58.467 --> 04:00.700
I said, "Okay, well, how much
is it to get it out?"

04:00.767 --> 04:03.533
She said, "I don't know but
it's been there for five days."

04:04.133 --> 04:08.266
So, for a car to be in, uh,
impound for five days or so,

04:08.333 --> 04:09.800
the price goes up day by day.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.400
So, I made an offer to her.

04:11.467 --> 04:14.100
I said, "Can you sell me
the car for 1,200?

04:14.166 --> 04:16.000
I'm not going to
loan you the money

04:16.066 --> 04:17.767
so you can get the car
and use it yourself."

04:17.834 --> 04:19.166
Um, she said,
"Okay, that's fine."

04:19.233 --> 04:22.400
And I have proof that we made
a statement on selling.

04:22.467 --> 04:23.500
[Judy] May I see that?

04:23.567 --> 04:24.700
Yes.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.734
These are text messages
on Facebook.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.133
[Judy] Do you work?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.166
No.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.734
-How do you support yourself?
-Um...

04:44.800 --> 04:47.633
I support myself
the way I support myself.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.967
I don't know
what else to say.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.367
You always supported yourself
the way you support yourself?

04:51.433 --> 04:52.500
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'm asking you

04:52.567 --> 04:54.967
this question, because it says--

04:55.033 --> 04:56.100
My sister has helped me
in the past,

04:56.166 --> 04:57.333
but I support myself.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.100
Well, the reason
I'm asking you this question,

04:59.166 --> 05:01.500
because what you say
in this text is

05:01.567 --> 05:04.333
you were talking about
the rent moratorium,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.467
so I assume you weren't
paying rent where you were.

05:06.533 --> 05:10.000
Hmm-mm. I just recently, um,
got evicted from my apartment.

05:10.066 --> 05:11.934
-For non-payment of rent?
-Yes.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.567
Okay. What happened next?

05:13.633 --> 05:16.400
So, I left school,
picked her up,

05:16.467 --> 05:19.100
and we went to the, uh,
impound to go get it out.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.533
First we stopped at the ATM.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.533
I have the bank statements
of me withdrawing the cash.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.233
You withdrew $1,200?

05:25.300 --> 05:26.333
Fifteen.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.200
I was not with her
when she withdrew the money.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.867
Were you with her
at the impound?

05:29.934 --> 05:30.867
-Yes.
-[Judy] Yeah, you had to be

05:30.934 --> 05:31.867
with her at the impound.

05:31.934 --> 05:33.600
So, you were with her
at the impound.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.400
And did you see
the transfer of funds?

05:35.467 --> 05:38.266
Um, no, I waited outside
of the office while she paid.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.100
-I had to go back there to get my vehicle.
-Did you--

05:40.166 --> 05:41.800
Did you know how much she paid?

05:41.867 --> 05:42.867
Yes, I do.

05:42.934 --> 05:46.133
Okay. And what was
your arrangement with her?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.500
-Um, our arrangement was--
-[Judy] Look at me.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.100
What was
your arrangement with her?

05:50.166 --> 05:53.333
She was helping you
to get your car out,

05:53.400 --> 05:55.200
and what was your
arrangement with her

05:55.266 --> 05:57.467
with regard to this money,
because it was

05:57.533 --> 05:58.900
-1,200 dollars?
-[Sandi] I was gonna go with her

05:58.967 --> 05:59.934
and let her keep the car

06:00.066 --> 06:01.934
so she can take, so she can go
to her classes that week.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.800
The arrangement
that you want me to believe

06:04.867 --> 06:06.900
is that she paid 1,200 dollars

06:06.967 --> 06:09.100
for the use of your car for a week.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.300
You want me to believe that?

06:10.367 --> 06:11.300
I mean--

06:11.367 --> 06:13.000
You want this face
to believe that?

06:13.066 --> 06:14.900
-You can believe it if you--
-[Judy] Just a second.

06:14.967 --> 06:17.867
I-- you may get over
on some people.

06:17.934 --> 06:19.367
But that was not your arrangement.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.767
I'm going to give you a minute
to take your breath

06:21.834 --> 06:26.033
because she could have taken
drivers in a limousine

06:26.100 --> 06:28.100
to go to her classes
for less than 1,200 dollars.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.100
-Yes, she could have.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.567
So, the arrangement wasn't that

06:31.633 --> 06:34.300
she could use your car
for a week to go to class.

06:34.367 --> 06:37.800
And in return for that,
in return for that, she would,

06:37.867 --> 06:39.533
she would give you 1,200,

06:39.600 --> 06:40.567
it just doesn't make sense.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.133
The 1,200 dollars
wasn't all paid off.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
She gave me 200 cash
also that day.

06:45.266 --> 06:46.667
So, she paid the car.

06:46.734 --> 06:47.767
She paid the car, the place,

06:47.834 --> 06:49.166
and gave me 200 cash.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.166
[Judy] Two or three?

06:50.233 --> 06:51.166
Two.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.467
[Judy] And so, she kept
the 100 for herself?

06:52.533 --> 06:53.967
Yes. She told me

06:54.033 --> 06:55.500
-to hold it for her.
-[Judy] Oh, whatever.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.800
So, so far, that's
1,400 dollars.

06:57.867 --> 06:59.934
And what happened with the car?

07:00.066 --> 07:00.967
I held on to it.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.166
For how long?

07:02.233 --> 07:04.667
Uh, I think it was
about three or four days.

07:04.734 --> 07:05.800
And then what happened?

07:05.867 --> 07:07.700
Can I tell you
what our arrangement was?

07:07.767 --> 07:09.867
-Yes.
-Our arrangement was that

07:09.934 --> 07:10.967
she was going to
take care of Lillian

07:11.033 --> 07:12.700
while I was taking midterms.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.867
So, I've seen it as we were
benefiting each other,

07:15.934 --> 07:18.367
I'd get the car out for--
for her

07:18.433 --> 07:21.533
while she watched Lillian
for me, so I could, uh, study.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.667
So, the agreement was
that in exchange for

07:24.734 --> 07:26.133
getting her car out,

07:26.200 --> 07:29.600
she was going to take care
of her own daughter for a week

07:29.667 --> 07:31.233
while you studied for midterms?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.233
Yes, ma'am.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.233
[Judy] That was the agreement?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.233
Yes, ma'am.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.300
That's reasonable.
Well, it's not reasonable.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.567
It's sort of ridiculous,
but that I can understand.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.133
[theme music]

07:42.200 --> 07:43.934
If you're going to be a liar,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.633
you have to be
a consistent liar.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.266
I know how to lie,
believe me. I'm not.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.667
Oh, I absolutely
know that, Madam.

07:49.734 --> 07:50.900
But I'm not lying right now.

07:50.967 --> 07:52.533
I absolutely know that.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.934
[narrator] <i>And later today...</i>

07:54.000 --> 07:55.767
You knew, Ms. Foster,

07:55.834 --> 07:58.133
that you weren't driving
the car on Monday

07:58.200 --> 08:00.533
and you weren't driving
the car on Tuesday,

08:00.600 --> 08:02.367
and you weren't driving
the car on Wednesday.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.467

Like shooting fish in a barrel.

08:31.667 --> 08:32.600
-Two.
-[Judy] How many days?

08:32.667 --> 08:33.600
So, you kept her for two?

08:33.667 --> 08:34.600
Two days.

08:34.667 --> 08:35.600
[Judy] And then,
what did you do with her?

08:35.667 --> 08:36.934
[Sandi] The third day,
it was night time,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.567
time to go to bed
and she kept on crying.

08:39.633 --> 08:41.133
She kept on crying
her dad's name.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.333
And I tried for like
an hour and a half

08:43.400 --> 08:45.233
to get her go to sleep.
She didn't want to go to sleep.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.734
She just wanted her dad,
her dad, her dad.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.066
So, I called her dad,
and I told him, "Look,

08:49.133 --> 08:50.800
you know, I know how to
take care of my daughter,

08:50.867 --> 08:52.834
but she will
not stop crying for you.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.834
I don't know what to do."

08:53.900 --> 08:55.500
So, he told me to go ahead
and take her to him.

08:55.567 --> 08:56.533
So, I took her to her father.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.133
Well, if you're
going to be a liar,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.734
you have to be
a consistent liar.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.900
I know how to lie, believe me.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.500
Oh, I absolutely
know that, Madam.

09:05.567 --> 09:06.734
[Sandi] But I'm
not lying right now.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.133
[Judy] I absolutely,
I absolutely know that.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.166
"A week later, Lillyanna asked
if I could watch Lillian,

09:13.233 --> 09:14.433
my biological daughter.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.367
Lillyanna
has legal guardianship,

09:16.433 --> 09:18.834
but she needed a babysitter
during midterms week."

09:18.900 --> 09:21.133
So far, we are together.
I agree.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.467
"But when Lillian came
to my house,

09:22.533 --> 09:24.900
she refused to obey my rules.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.700
I called Lillyanna
to pick her up

09:27.767 --> 09:29.166
and she didn't respond.

09:29.233 --> 09:32.333
I had no choice but to take
Lillian to her dad's house.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.600
I dropped her off there

09:33.667 --> 09:36.367
with the clothes that Lillyanna
had brought with her."

09:36.433 --> 09:39.433
Well, that's a whole
different story than crying,

09:39.500 --> 09:42.333
couldn't go to sleep,
I want my dad, my dad, my dad,

09:42.400 --> 09:45.166
I called her dad
and he said bring her over.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.367
That's a whole different story.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.533
This says, "she wouldn't obey",
the five-year-old,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.567
your five-year-old
wouldn't obey your rules.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.934
By going to sleep
when I told her to go to sleep.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.066
[laughs]

09:55.133 --> 09:56.300
I don't see
what's so funny about that.

09:56.367 --> 09:59.934
Oh, my God. Okay,
so you took her to her father.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.500
And you said, "I want my money back.
You broke our agreement."

10:02.567 --> 10:04.867
And she came, took her car.
That's what happened.

10:04.934 --> 10:05.867
Correct.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.400
And you want your money back?

10:07.467 --> 10:08.467
Yes, ma'am.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.300
Yeah, well,
you breached the agreement.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.934
The agreement was she could use
the car for a week,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.767
you would take care of
your daughter for a week,

10:14.834 --> 10:16.166
and she would take care
of the car.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.734
That was your agreement. What?

10:17.800 --> 10:20.400
She never returned
the clothes to him.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.433
-[Sandi] And she never--
-[Judy] And not, not--

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
-I'm not-- I don't care about--
-She never intended

10:23.567 --> 10:24.734
to return my car either.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.867
Right now, I don't care
about the clothes.

10:25.934 --> 10:28.600
Right now, this is
a simple contract case,

10:28.667 --> 10:30.533
which is very easy for me.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.633
You know, this, in spite of
the blurry lines of truth,

10:34.700 --> 10:37.500
it's actually quite simple.
You had a contract,

10:37.567 --> 10:39.867
according to,
actually both of you,

10:39.934 --> 10:43.266
that you would get her car
out of tow,

10:43.333 --> 10:45.533
and give her a couple
of hundred bucks besides

10:45.600 --> 10:49.166
because she was being evicted
from her apartment, I gather.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.467
And in exchange for that,
she would let you use the car,

10:52.533 --> 10:56.266
and she was going to
take care of her own child for a week.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.600
And instead,
she brought the child

10:58.667 --> 11:00.467
to the biological father's house,

11:00.533 --> 11:04.000
who has not been declared
the child's biological father.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.367
And you got angry with her,

11:05.433 --> 11:07.567
and you said,
"Now I want the car back

11:07.633 --> 11:08.633
or I want the money."

11:08.700 --> 11:10.233
-That--
-[Judy] That's where we're at.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.834
Okay. And so far,
based upon what you told me,

11:12.900 --> 11:15.066
you gave her 1,400 dollars.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.734
Twelve hundred dollars
is what the tow was.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.800
Do you have proof of that?

11:17.867 --> 11:18.800
I have that.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.000
I'd like to see it.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.533
This is for my plates also.
She paid that that same day.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
Thank you.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.867
Judge.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.967
Okay. So, so far, the tow

11:42.033 --> 11:45.800
and the getting it
out of impound was $483.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.066
Is that what you paid them?

11:47.133 --> 11:48.734
Yes, at the towing facility.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.066
That doesn't include
what we paid at the dealership

11:51.133 --> 11:52.533
to pay for the plates.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.133
The receipt is up there.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.834
The $300 is for the plates.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.900
That's $783.

11:57.967 --> 11:58.967
Yes.

11:59.033 --> 11:59.967
-Well, why would you give her--
-[Sandi] Plus another--

12:00.100 --> 12:01.266
Shh.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.333
-[Sandi] I'm sorry.
-Why would you give her 1,200?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
I took out extra cash

12:04.467 --> 12:06.400
because it was going to go
to Lillian's father.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.266
I was going to give him money

12:08.333 --> 12:12.734
because the Biden tax, um,
checks child credit,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.200
I was getting those
into my account.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.567
And I was taking cash out

12:15.633 --> 12:18.066
-as well to give to him.
-Why?

12:18.133 --> 12:19.467
Because he deserves
half as well.

12:19.533 --> 12:20.467
Why?

12:20.533 --> 12:22.934
Because he takes care of her
just as much as I do.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.200
-[Judy] Oh, he does?
-Yes.

12:24.266 --> 12:26.800
Well, all it cost you
to get the car out

12:26.867 --> 12:29.300
was 783 dollars.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.033
And I gave her cash
on top of that.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.266
Whatever profit was left.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.266
You just told me you gave her
200 dollars in cash.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.467
It wasn't 200 dollars.

12:36.533 --> 12:39.066
-No.
-She said 200 dollars.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.400
It was 200.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.100
She would say that
because it was just cash.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.533
It was a cash transaction,

12:43.600 --> 12:46.633
including another 50-dollar
Cash App transaction

12:46.700 --> 12:49.700
that she wanted,
she needed that same day.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.066
How much cash did she give you?

12:51.133 --> 12:52.166
Two hundred cash in my hand.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.300
[Judy] And she paid
to get the car out?

12:53.367 --> 12:54.300
Yes.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.300
[Judy] And she
paid for the plates.

12:55.367 --> 12:56.300
-Yes.
-Yeah.

12:56.367 --> 12:58.000
All of that comes together, 983.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.200
Judgment for the plaintiff.
Thank you very much.

13:00.266 --> 13:01.333
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.567
[theme music]

13:03.633 --> 13:06.333
I'm glad this situation is over,
and it's behind me.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.033
I learned how to
start saying no.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.734
Lack of communication
with each other.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.100
It made the situation worse.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.133
Oh, we couldn't communicate.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.266
She just blocked me
on everything.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.400
I should have never did it.
I should have did it on my own.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.333
I have a big heart.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.700
And I always want
to help everybody.

13:17.767 --> 13:20.133
But I'm not going to
sit there and look stupid.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.533
We can just put this behind us
and act like it never happened.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.567
She burned a bridge forever.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.433
There were so many layers
to that case.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.734
But it was interesting

13:29.800 --> 13:33.567
that the biological father
of this child doesn't work

13:33.633 --> 13:36.233
and gets disability
because he has a pacemaker.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.100
And yet,
according to the plaintiff,

13:38.166 --> 13:40.233
he watches the child
half the time.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.934
Do you know
how much energy it takes

13:42.000 --> 13:43.867
to watch a five-year-old?

13:43.934 --> 13:45.266
-I do.
-[Judy] Yeah.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.600
Can you imagine going to college

13:46.667 --> 13:48.667
and taking care
of a five-year-old?

13:48.734 --> 13:51.200
No, no shot,
I give her credit for doing it.

13:51.266 --> 13:52.900
And she gave a good answer.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.166
You know, the way she said
keep your family together.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.500
That's pretty responsible.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.300
Let's keep your fingers
crossed for that baby

13:58.367 --> 14:00.800
and hope that baby
turns out okay.

14:00.867 --> 14:03.567
Case number 1013.
Foster versus Kelly.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.100
Please step forward.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.500
[narrator] <i>D'Eryka Foster</i>
<i>is suing her cousin,</i>

14:07.567 --> 14:09.033
<i>Ronaldo Kelly,</i>

14:09.100 --> 14:12.300
<i>for expenses she received</i>

14:12.367 --> 14:14.233
Miss Foster,
this is your cousin.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.467
Yes.

14:15.533 --> 14:17.433
There was a period of time,
Mr. Kelly,

14:17.500 --> 14:20.033
that you were living
with your cousin.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.200
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] In her home?

14:21.266 --> 14:22.633
-[Ronaldo] Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] When was that?

14:22.700 --> 14:28.767
Uh, it was around the
beginning of December in 2020.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.734
Right into,
coming to the New Year.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.300
How long did you live with her?

14:32.367 --> 14:33.233
For a week.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.367
One week?

14:34.433 --> 14:35.500
One week.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.367
-[Judy] Is that right?
-Correct.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.934
[Judy] And during that week,
did you use her car?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.934
Yes, ma'am.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.166
And did you have
an accident in her car?

14:43.233 --> 14:44.166
Yes, ma'am.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.367
[Judy] And when you were
using her car,

14:46.433 --> 14:48.533
and you had an accident
in the car,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.533
did you have her permission
to use the car?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.533
Yes, ma'am.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.834
When you were in the car,

14:53.900 --> 14:56.433
and using the car
with her permission,

14:56.500 --> 14:59.467
you were dressed with a wig?

14:59.533 --> 15:00.867
Yes, ma'am.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.834
[Judy] You were
pretending to be her?

15:02.900 --> 15:03.834
Yes, ma'am.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.834
[Judy] Because she had
a Lyft license.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.834
Yes, ma'am.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.800
Whatever they have,
what are they called?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.333
Do you know,
where you could drive--?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.433
You don't know?
What is it when you--?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.767
-Rideshare.
-An authorized Lyft driver.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.967
An authorized Lyft driver.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.467
You have to take a test
for that?

15:19.533 --> 15:21.600
-No.
-[Judy] You just have to apply?

15:21.667 --> 15:22.600
Correct.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.734
[Judy] Do you have to
pay any money?

15:23.800 --> 15:24.867
-No.
-Do you have to

15:24.934 --> 15:27.133
-give them any money?
-No.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.300
[Judy] I can't understand
how this whole thing--

15:28.367 --> 15:29.767
These things
are so complicated.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.200
[whispers] Wish they'd be easier.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.600
[audience laughs]

15:33.600 --> 15:35.700
"Ronaldo has been using
my Lyft account

15:35.767 --> 15:37.600
without my knowledge
or permission."

15:37.667 --> 15:39.567
Well, that's not true. Right?

15:39.633 --> 15:40.767
Wrong.

15:40.834 --> 15:43.767
What's wrong?
What you just told me?

15:43.834 --> 15:45.033
You see, you can't
have it both ways.

because you were using
her car, her license.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.734
You would give her
what percentage?

16:29.800 --> 16:30.734
Sixty percent.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.300
And you would keep
40 for yourself.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.367
Yes, ma'am.

16:33.433 --> 16:36.500
How many times had you
used the car as a Lyft driver

16:36.567 --> 16:38.100
during that week
you stayed with her?

16:38.166 --> 16:40.934
It was six days
from Monday through Saturday.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.200
And this accident
happened on Saturday?

16:43.266 --> 16:44.467
-Night.
-[Judy] Saturday night.

16:44.533 --> 16:47.066
So, on Monday,
how much money did you make?

16:47.133 --> 16:50.867
I would say a range
around maybe, maybe like a,

16:50.934 --> 16:53.233
maybe a hundred and, like, 30 dollars.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.333
Or maybe like 140.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.700
It was somewhere
around that range.

16:55.767 --> 16:58.200
How does that work?
Does the customer pay you?

16:58.266 --> 17:01.233
Yes, they pay you
for-for picking them up.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.300
[Judy] They pay you in cash,
or they put it on an app?

17:03.367 --> 17:04.467
They-they put on the app.

17:04.533 --> 17:05.967
-It's so confusing.
-[Ronaldo] They do, like,

17:06.033 --> 17:07.066
yeah, they do it over the app.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.800
So, they pay you, and it goes
right into your account?

17:09.867 --> 17:10.934
Yes, ma'am.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.867
And on Tuesday
when you worked,

17:12.934 --> 17:14.333
and they put it in your account.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.600
Right, or they put it--

17:15.667 --> 17:17.600
-Or they put it in her account.
-[Ronaldo] Her account, right.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.133
[Judy] Okay. So, now
it's in her account.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.300
-[Ronaldo] Yes.
-[Judy] Did she give you money?

17:21.367 --> 17:24.133
Yes, she did give me money
to furnish for gas.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.533
Okay. She gave you money,

17:25.600 --> 17:28.100
but she also gave you money
for working, I assume,

17:28.166 --> 17:29.800
-from her account?
-Yes, yes, the 40 percent.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.266
Did she give that to you every day?

17:31.333 --> 17:32.633
Every day. Yes, ma'am.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.967
So, the money actually went
into her account on Monday.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.633
-So, she saw it your Monday.
-[Ronaldo] You're right.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.600
Now let's go to Tuesday.
Tuesday, did you work?

17:40.667 --> 17:41.633
Yes, ma'am.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.000
You remember about how
much money you made on Tuesday?

17:44.066 --> 17:46.367
It was perfectly--
like, around the same thing,

17:46.433 --> 17:47.367
like maybe a hundred and like,

17:47.433 --> 17:49.667
twenty, 30 dollars
that day too, as well.

17:49.734 --> 17:51.567
[Judy] And when it goes
into your account,

17:51.633 --> 17:53.467
this December of 2020,

17:53.533 --> 17:57.333
so you have it added up
by month or by week or by day?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.500
-By day.
-[Ronaldo] By day.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.967
So, you saw that money
in your account on Monday?

18:01.033 --> 18:01.967
-Yes.
-[Judy] Yes.

18:02.033 --> 18:04.533
And you saw the money
in your account on Tuesday?

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
Yes.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.934
[Judy] And on Wednesday?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.233
-Yes.
-[Judy] Now, you knew,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.533
Miss Foster,
that you weren't driving

18:11.600 --> 18:13.367
the car on Monday, right?

18:13.433 --> 18:14.500
Yes.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.033
And you weren't driving
the car on Tuesday?

18:17.100 --> 18:18.467
Right?

18:18.533 --> 18:20.100
And you weren't driving
the car on Wednesday.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.633
You see how easy this is?
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.333
Let me tell you what you wrote
in your complaint.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.533
"Ronaldo is my cousin,
he moved to Atlanta.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.533
He came to work with me.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.567
I was working from home,
not using my vehicle.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.467
He asked if he could borrow
my car to earn some money

18:34.533 --> 18:36.600
by making food deliveries.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.433
Few days later, he informed me
he was in an accident.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.533
At first, he said
someone hit my car.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.066
After investigation,
it was revealed

18:44.133 --> 18:46.333
that Ronaldo had been using
my Lyft account

18:46.400 --> 18:48.533
without my knowledge
or permission."

18:48.600 --> 18:49.900
Well, that's not true.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.333
"I used to be a Lyft driver,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
so when he asked
to borrow my iPad,

18:53.467 --> 18:56.500
he discovered my Lyft account
which included a photo."

18:56.567 --> 18:58.600
That's also not true, right?

18:58.667 --> 19:00.300
-Wrong.
-What's wrong?

19:00.367 --> 19:01.900
What you just told me?

19:01.967 --> 19:03.734
You see, you can't
have it both ways.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.900
What you just told me
was on Monday,

19:05.967 --> 19:08.500
money got deposited
in your account by your cousin

19:08.567 --> 19:11.133
who was driving your car
as a Lyft driver.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.300
You weren't driving your car,

19:12.367 --> 19:13.967
you knew you weren't
driving the car,

19:14.033 --> 19:16.066
and it wasn't coming to you
for making food deliveries.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.633
On Tuesday, you had money
put in your Lyft account.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.900
You gave him money
on both Monday and Tuesday

19:21.967 --> 19:24.066
or Tuesday and Wednesday,
the day afterwards.

19:24.133 --> 19:27.066
So when you say he used
your Lyft account

19:27.133 --> 19:29.166
without your knowledge,
that's not true.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.700
That's what you wrote
in your complaint.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.867
That's what you swore to.
Do you want to read it?

19:32.934 --> 19:35.300
-I know what I wrote.
-[Judy] Is that truth?

19:35.367 --> 19:36.266
That's what I wrote.

19:36.333 --> 19:41.200
No. I-I want to know
if what you wrote is the truth,

19:41.266 --> 19:43.433
-or what's here is the truth.
-[D'Eryka] Supposedly, supposedly

19:43.500 --> 19:46.266
he had his own Rideshare account

19:46.333 --> 19:48.467
because he did
a background check.

19:48.533 --> 19:51.333
So, you can register,
my vehicle can be registered

19:51.400 --> 19:53.967
up on to somewhere,
someone else's account.

19:54.033 --> 19:58.033
So he lied to me about
what was actually going on.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.066
Oh, I don't believe that
at all, Miss Foster.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.767
-I don't believe that at all.
-[D'Eryka] Okay.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.367
He had an accident
with your car.

20:03.433 --> 20:04.667
You had insurance on the car?

20:04.734 --> 20:05.667
I did.

20:05.734 --> 20:06.667
And they disclaimed it

20:06.734 --> 20:08.734
because they said you two
were involved in a fraud,

20:08.800 --> 20:11.100
because he was driving
with your permission,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.467
which he clearly was,
based upon what he tells me.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.000
He was driving
with your permission.

20:15.066 --> 20:16.000
He had an accident.

20:16.066 --> 20:17.433
Your insurance company
disclaimed.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.734
Absolutely right.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.400
Just tell me about the accident.

20:21.467 --> 20:24.200
So, basically, I was,
had a customer in the car.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.700
I was taking him
to his location,

20:25.767 --> 20:29.166
and I was following the GPS
at the time.

20:29.233 --> 20:30.166
-And he told me--
-Look at me.

20:30.233 --> 20:32.934
And he told me that, uh,
I could find another direction

20:33.000 --> 20:34.133
quicker than the GPS.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.367
So, once he told me that,
I got out of track on the GPS

20:37.433 --> 20:39.633
and I tried to go the way
he was telling me to go,

20:39.700 --> 20:43.233
and I was in a two-turn lane,
sittin' in the left lane

20:43.300 --> 20:45.266
and I was
in the right-side lane.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.000
So when I made the left,

20:47.066 --> 20:51.467
I ended up trying to cross back
over into the inside left lane,

20:51.533 --> 20:53.800
and that's when the vehicle
from the inside came through

20:53.867 --> 20:55.667
and hit me because
well, I hit them,

20:55.734 --> 20:58.266
because I was trying
to get back on track

20:58.333 --> 20:59.600
to go where he was
telling me to go

20:59.667 --> 21:01.500
instead of following my GPS.

21:01.567 --> 21:02.700
You don't own the car?

21:02.767 --> 21:04.300
-No, ma'am.
-[Judy] Did they tow her car?

21:04.367 --> 21:06.066
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Was it totaled?

21:06.133 --> 21:09.433
I believe it was,
but the accident was pretty bad.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.000
Was the other car
damaged severely?

21:12.066 --> 21:13.433
Oh, no, ma'am,
only the trailer.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.600
Actually, the truck
didn't hit the car.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.667
It was the trailer
he was carrying.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.200
You drove down the side of the truck.

21:20.266 --> 21:22.533
-Is what-- It's what--
-You-you lied to me

21:22.600 --> 21:24.166
and told me that,

21:24.233 --> 21:28.834
oh, somebody just hit your car.
And I get there and whoo,

21:28.900 --> 21:31.934
you just clearly
drove down the trailer

21:32.000 --> 21:33.533
all the way to the end
of the truck.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.233
So, you started out lying.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.834
No, no, Miss Foster,
you started out lying.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.500
You started out lying
when you signed the complaint

21:40.567 --> 21:42.200
and you said you did not know

21:42.266 --> 21:44.500
that he was using
your Lyft license

21:44.567 --> 21:46.767
and pretending to be you,
which is clearly not true

21:46.834 --> 21:49.700
because he gave you money
every single day that he drove.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.033
So, he wasn't giving you money
as a gift.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.967
You were complicit
in this fraud.

21:54.033 --> 21:56.734
That's why the insurance company
disclaimed

21:56.800 --> 21:58.533
and that's why
I'm dismissing your case.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.867
We're finished. Thank you.

21:59.934 --> 22:01.233
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

22:04.266 --> 22:05.333
A spade is a spade

22:05.400 --> 22:07.567
and if you don't like
what I say, hit the highway.

22:07.633 --> 22:10.000
I hate that the situation happened with,

22:10.066 --> 22:11.967
uh, with the car and everything
but, you know, I've--

22:12.033 --> 22:14.800
I've told my truth
and I just feel like she made--

22:14.867 --> 22:16.000
she made the right decision.
You know.

22:16.066 --> 22:17.100
No, I was not fully aware.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.700
Well, basically I had a wig on,
and I had a mask on.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.500
So, people really couldn't
tell who it was.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.500
I don't want to talk about it.
I mean, it's a done deal now.

22:24.567 --> 22:26.700
Things went wrong.
Family member trying to help me out

22:26.767 --> 22:28.900
and the accident
just basically happened.

22:28.967 --> 22:30.600
He can stay away
from me, far away.

22:30.667 --> 22:31.633
Hit the highway.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.333
Oh, that's my cousin.
I love her to death, man.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
I hope our relationship
get better, right.

22:35.467 --> 22:36.467
[Judy] I don't know, Sarah.

22:36.533 --> 22:39.367
I-I don't remember
what class in law school

22:39.433 --> 22:42.667
when I learned about
the doctrine of clean hands.

22:42.734 --> 22:43.867
Contracts, most likely.

22:43.934 --> 22:47.233
Contracts, most likely.
In this case, it was clear

22:47.300 --> 22:49.600
that she couldn't
keep her story straight.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.867
So, she combines two things,

22:51.934 --> 22:55.433
the doctrine of clean hands,
she was part of the fraud

22:55.500 --> 22:58.400
by allowing her cousin
to use her license.

22:58.467 --> 23:01.700
And in addition to that,
she wasn't too swift,

23:01.767 --> 23:04.233
because if you tell the truth--

23:04.300 --> 23:06.266
-You don't have to have a good memory.
-A good memory.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.066
Right. Perfect.
