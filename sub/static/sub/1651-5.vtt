00:12.120 --> 00:14.477
Engines are running at full capacity, sir.

00:14.477 --> 00:16.678
Lieutenant Chung did a whale
of a job while I was down.

00:16.713 --> 00:20.349
Indeed he did. Should be in
Costa Rica by tomorrow morning.

00:20.416 --> 00:21.583
Attention on deck!

00:21.618 --> 00:23.218
How far inland are we going, sir?

00:23.253 --> 00:24.886
Carry on.

00:24.921 --> 00:26.888
Dr. Scott said the jungle
there is relatively close

00:26.923 --> 00:28.457
to the shoreline.

00:28.491 --> 00:29.992
Should give us easy access in and out.

00:30.026 --> 00:31.460
Sounds good, sir.

00:31.494 --> 00:33.829
- These gonna work for you, sir?
- Yeah. Good work.

00:33.863 --> 00:35.597
Well done, men.

00:35.632 --> 00:38.800
Don't exactly love the idea
of experimenting on monkeys.

00:38.835 --> 00:42.037
Better than humans, sir.

00:59.389 --> 01:02.357
- Hey, Max.
- What's up?

01:04.193 --> 01:07.496
Hey. Fancy meeting you here.

01:07.530 --> 01:10.932
It's been a month since I've
had any spare time to exercise.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.801
Other than sprinting away from
the Russians in the Arctic.

01:14.203 --> 01:15.804
Yeah, heard about that.

01:15.838 --> 01:17.939
Pretty ballsy...

01:18.007 --> 01:20.676
If I do say so myself.

01:20.743 --> 01:23.478
Survival instinct. Nothing more.

01:32.522 --> 01:33.789
Dumbbell?

01:33.823 --> 01:35.290
No.

01:35.358 --> 01:37.492
I think I'm done, thanks.

01:37.560 --> 01:42.264
How come I never see
you up in the wardroom?

01:42.332 --> 01:43.832
For meals?

01:43.866 --> 01:47.502
Well... you might not have heard,

01:47.537 --> 01:52.639
but I'm not particularly
well-liked on this ship.

01:52.639 --> 01:55.644
Ha! I find that hard to believe.

01:55.678 --> 01:59.748
I had to... lie to them all

01:59.782 --> 02:01.583
for four months.

02:01.617 --> 02:04.686
While we were up in the Arctic,

02:04.721 --> 02:06.521
the world was crumbling.

02:06.556 --> 02:10.157
Their families were dying.

02:10.193 --> 02:12.561
I knew it, and I wasn't
allowed to breathe a word of it.

02:14.931 --> 02:16.198
I think you underestimate

02:16.232 --> 02:18.533
people's capacity for forgiveness.

02:20.603 --> 02:23.271
Maybe you just find it too
hard to forgive yourself.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.009
It's not all on you, you know.

02:28.044 --> 02:31.580
- Isn't it?
- No.

02:35.218 --> 02:36.451
I'll see you later.

02:38.888 --> 02:40.288
Wardroom.

02:42.258 --> 02:44.292
I'll save a spot for you.

02:47.597 --> 02:51.099
Wednesday, November 5th.

02:51.134 --> 02:52.401
We're headed to Costa Rica

02:52.435 --> 02:54.936
to try to find Dr. Scott some monkeys.

02:54.971 --> 02:56.772
I don't know why I keep
making these recordings

02:56.806 --> 02:58.073
or who might ever find them

02:58.107 --> 03:00.208
and how they'd even get 'em to you.

03:00.243 --> 03:02.744
I keep trying to picture you all

03:02.779 --> 03:04.446
in my father's cabin.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.882
You could barely spend a
holiday weekend with the man,

03:06.949 --> 03:08.350
so you're probably just about ready

03:08.418 --> 03:10.552
to tear his head off by now.

03:19.462 --> 03:21.229
It's hard here...

03:24.167 --> 03:26.401
Not knowing what's going
on in the outside world,

03:26.436 --> 03:29.137
wondering if...

03:29.172 --> 03:32.774
When...

03:32.809 --> 03:35.877
When we come home...

03:35.912 --> 03:37.479
What we'll be coming back to.

03:45.221 --> 03:49.524
- Hey.
- Sorry to disturb you.

03:49.559 --> 03:51.293
We're picking up all
kinds of distress signals

03:51.360 --> 03:54.529
coming out of Costa Rica,
especially outside Limón.

03:54.564 --> 03:55.964
What kind of distress?

03:55.998 --> 03:57.599
Lot of sickness. Civil unrest.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.835
Doesn't look like we're gonna
get any kind of safe passage

03:59.869 --> 04:01.470
into that jungle.

04:01.504 --> 04:02.871
Civil unrest?

04:02.905 --> 04:04.339
Nothing we can do anything about,

04:04.373 --> 04:05.874
not unless you wanna
get sidetracked for weeks

04:05.908 --> 04:08.043
and get into the nation-building business.

04:08.077 --> 04:09.678
Better get Dr. Scott up here.

04:09.712 --> 04:11.012
I already spoke to her.

04:11.047 --> 04:14.049
She said our next best option's Nicaragua.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.851
There's a monkey reserve about 30 miles

04:15.885 --> 04:18.053
up that long, narrow river.

04:18.087 --> 04:19.553
We'll never get the ship in there,

04:19.589 --> 04:21.589
but we could send a few
teams on the R.H.I.Bs.

04:21.624 --> 04:24.359
- 30 miles.
- Yeah. Outside radar range.

04:24.393 --> 04:26.361
Comms is unsure whether
the frequency signals

04:26.395 --> 04:27.729
in that area will be strong enough

04:27.763 --> 04:29.631
for us to keep in radio contact, too.

04:29.665 --> 04:31.333
Just keeps getting better.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.002
Oh, you haven't heard the best part.

04:34.036 --> 04:36.638
Dr. Scott insists that she
comes along for the ride.

04:36.706 --> 04:38.340
Unless any of us can
tell the difference

04:38.374 --> 04:40.408
between a capuchin tufted and a...

04:40.443 --> 04:43.378
Geoffroy's spider monkey.

04:43.412 --> 04:45.146
Is that reserve inhabited?

04:45.181 --> 04:46.848
She said she was there a few years back,

04:46.883 --> 04:49.484
but there are only small
teams of anthropologists

04:49.519 --> 04:51.520
that visit sometimes to observe,

04:51.554 --> 04:54.356
so otherwise, not supposed to be.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.024
Gonna need plenty of room on that R.H.I.B.

04:56.092 --> 04:57.993
For those monkeys.

04:58.027 --> 04:59.494
We'll go with small teams.

04:59.562 --> 05:01.730
- You'll handle it.
- Not just me.

05:01.764 --> 05:05.333
Gonna need all my best men.
That includes you.

05:05.401 --> 05:08.904
Been a while since I've been hunting.

05:08.938 --> 05:11.873
Mm.

05:54.250 --> 05:57.018
Whoo! Man, I love a hunting trip!

06:00.856 --> 06:02.490
Ensign Mason is taking a field radio.

06:02.525 --> 06:04.125
As usual, we will operate at EMCON.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.928
They will report in,
but we will not respond.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.431
We do expect the teams
will fall out of range.

06:09.465 --> 06:11.766
When they do, we'll go to a flare system.

06:11.801 --> 06:14.202
Green means no radio contact available,

06:14.236 --> 06:16.504
but all is okay. Red means no radio,

06:16.539 --> 06:18.039
and things are not okay.

06:18.074 --> 06:19.474
We're gonna hope we
never see that red flare,

06:19.508 --> 06:21.543
but we're prepared in case we do.

06:21.611 --> 06:23.427
I'll need a dedicated
lookout on the bridge wing.

06:23.427 --> 06:25.452
Aye, commander.

07:11.449 --> 07:14.451
Look familiar?

07:18.690 --> 07:20.557
Well, this is the edge of the reserve.

07:20.591 --> 07:23.093
As I recall, there's a stream
in there near a waterfall.

07:23.127 --> 07:24.795
The monkeys would congregate there

07:24.862 --> 07:26.596
because of the clean water.

07:26.631 --> 07:29.199
Report our position back to the ship.

07:29.267 --> 07:31.835
- Yes, sir.
- Tex, Burk,

07:31.869 --> 07:33.270
stay here with Mason and Dr. Scott.

07:33.304 --> 07:34.638
The rest of us will scout the area.

07:34.672 --> 07:37.174
- Captain Chandler, we...
- You're staying here.

07:40.678 --> 07:42.312
Got it. They just disembarked

07:42.347 --> 07:45.038
at the Western edge of
the reserve, Southern bank,

07:45.038 --> 07:46.283
still in radio range.

08:24.322 --> 08:28.558
Hey, uh, Doc, you got a... fella?

08:28.593 --> 08:33.163
Last I heard, he was in Beijing,
but that was months ago now.

08:33.231 --> 08:37.467
He's a journalist. Travels a lot.

08:37.501 --> 08:38.735
And you?

08:38.770 --> 08:40.604
Oh, I'm a bit of a rolling stone,

08:40.638 --> 08:44.508
- as you might imagine.
- A man your age, never married?

08:44.575 --> 08:46.843
A man my age?

08:46.878 --> 08:49.146
Hit a soft spot, did I?

08:49.180 --> 08:53.617
Oh, I'm 2% body fat, honey.
Ain't no soft spot to hit.

08:53.651 --> 08:55.752
Except for that 2%.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.220
Oh!

08:57.255 --> 08:59.990
She is a smart one, isn't she?

09:15.139 --> 09:18.642
Hear that? Water.

09:18.676 --> 09:21.378
Waterfall.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.889
Masks! Now! Masks!

09:34.392 --> 09:36.359
¡El Toro! ¡El Toro, por favor!

09:36.394 --> 09:39.262
Fall back! Fall back!

09:39.297 --> 09:40.931
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'm sorry!

09:40.965 --> 09:42.599
To the boat now!

09:42.633 --> 09:44.101
I'm sorry. We cannot help you.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.037
Where are they all coming from?

09:47.105 --> 09:48.538
Get away! Get off me!

09:50.475 --> 09:53.376
- El Toro, señor.
- Get out of here.

09:53.411 --> 09:54.811
Get back to the boats now!

09:54.846 --> 09:56.847
- ¡El Toro!
- I'm sorry. We can't help you.

09:56.881 --> 09:59.382
Stay back! Move, move, move!

09:59.417 --> 10:00.817
¡El Toro!

10:02.286 --> 10:03.854
Hey, Burky.

10:03.921 --> 10:06.590
Cubano?

10:06.657 --> 10:08.658
Perks of Gitmo, my man.

10:08.693 --> 10:10.060
I'll wait.

10:10.128 --> 10:11.461
All right.

10:14.866 --> 10:18.935
- We've got trouble.
- Start your engines!

10:18.970 --> 10:21.505
You are out of here!

10:21.539 --> 10:24.474
Now! Back to the James!

10:24.509 --> 10:27.010
I cannot risk you going upriver!
It is not open for debate!

10:27.044 --> 10:28.945
We'll get you an assortment of monkeys!

10:28.980 --> 10:30.614
You're just gonna have to make do!

10:33.384 --> 10:37.387
Now, Burk!

10:50.067 --> 10:54.104
They're splitting up.
That was not the plan.

11:02.346 --> 11:04.648
According to this chart, the nearest town

11:04.682 --> 11:06.783
is 20 miles inland on
that side of the river.

11:06.817 --> 11:09.653
So they made it all the way
here through the jungle on foot?

11:09.720 --> 11:11.121
What about the other side of the river?

11:11.189 --> 11:13.190
Nothing, sir, at least not here.

11:13.224 --> 11:16.359
They must have been
congregating by the waterfall.

11:16.394 --> 11:19.329
There's gotta be other places
in this region to find monkeys.

11:19.397 --> 11:21.164
We already know Costa Rica's no good.

11:21.232 --> 11:22.432
According to Dr. Scott,

11:22.500 --> 11:24.134
most of central America's a hot zone

11:24.168 --> 11:26.369
with not many choices.

11:28.906 --> 11:30.207
Upriver.

12:05.287 --> 12:08.589
Ma'am, Tex and lieutenant Burk
just landed with Dr. Scott.

12:08.624 --> 12:09.891
She's in decon now.

12:09.925 --> 12:11.192
I'll debrief her in the wardroom, ASAP.

12:11.226 --> 12:13.861
Yes, ma'am.

12:20.903 --> 12:25.373
Nathan James, this is vulture team. Over.

12:25.407 --> 12:28.876
Nathan James, this is vulture team. Over.

12:28.911 --> 12:30.411
We're out of range, sir.

12:30.445 --> 12:34.382
- All right, send up the green flare.
- Yes, sir.

12:36.051 --> 12:37.518
Clear!

12:41.890 --> 12:44.058
What the...

12:46.795 --> 12:48.696
Weapons!

12:53.635 --> 12:55.069
"El Toro"?

12:55.103 --> 12:56.704
That's what all the
sick people were saying.

12:56.738 --> 12:57.939
Board it, sir?

12:57.973 --> 13:01.576
Absolutely not. We keep moving.

13:02.945 --> 13:05.279
So the most concentrated
area for the primates

13:05.314 --> 13:07.481
is on the northern bank, deep upriver,

13:07.516 --> 13:09.116
and the Captain knows as much.

13:09.151 --> 13:11.118
I suspect they're headed that way.

13:11.153 --> 13:12.420
And you have no reason to believe

13:12.454 --> 13:13.888
there's any human population there?

13:13.922 --> 13:15.222
No, but I didn't think

13:15.290 --> 13:16.557
there'd be any on the Southern side either.

13:16.592 --> 13:18.426
So once they are out of radio range,

13:18.460 --> 13:20.127
they can't come back in, correct?

13:20.162 --> 13:21.929
It'll be flares from here on out.

13:21.964 --> 13:23.931
We just have to hope the
weather's clear enough

13:23.966 --> 13:25.566
that we can even see them.

13:25.601 --> 13:28.536
Perhaps you should send
a backup team out there

13:28.570 --> 13:29.971
on the other R.H.I.B.

13:30.005 --> 13:32.707
Captain would've specified that.

13:32.741 --> 13:36.744
Protocol was 48 hours,
unless we get that red flare.

13:38.046 --> 13:40.247
Damn it.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.114
Aah!

14:13.148 --> 14:14.548
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God!

14:14.583 --> 14:16.250
Set a perimeter! I got you, I got you.

14:16.284 --> 14:17.985
Oh!

14:18.020 --> 14:21.455
Listen, I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is gonna hurt.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.091
Aah! Oh, God!

14:24.126 --> 14:26.293
It stings!

14:27.896 --> 14:33.100
Ambush! Ambush! Ambush!
U.S. Navy! Stand down!

14:33.168 --> 14:36.137
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

14:42.177 --> 14:45.146
Let's go.

14:50.552 --> 14:53.487
Dale. Dale.

14:57.025 --> 14:59.026
¡Camine! ¡Vamos!

15:03.198 --> 15:06.133
Straight! Walk straight!

15:06.168 --> 15:09.837
¡Vengan! El Toro.

15:09.905 --> 15:11.472
Alto.

15:27.255 --> 15:29.356
Ya apúrate.

16:25.814 --> 16:29.450
El Toro, Los americanos.

16:39.494 --> 16:41.962
Hello.

16:42.030 --> 16:44.098
Welcome to my jungle.

16:44.132 --> 16:47.001
I'm guessing you must be El Toro.

16:47.035 --> 16:48.502
I am, indeed.

16:48.537 --> 16:50.838
And who do I have the
pleasure of talking to?

16:50.872 --> 16:52.973
Tom Chandler, U.S. Navy.

16:53.008 --> 16:55.609
Your men took our weapons,
C.B.R., suits, and equipment.

16:55.644 --> 16:56.877
We're gonna need 'em back.

16:59.648 --> 17:01.148
You won't need your suits.

17:01.216 --> 17:03.284
There is no virus here.

17:03.318 --> 17:04.952
As for your weapons, I cannot have your men

17:04.986 --> 17:06.252
walking around with machine guns.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.189
That would frighten my people.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.156
Well, I'm afraid that's not acceptable.

17:10.192 --> 17:13.828
With respect, I don't
have time to debate it.

17:13.862 --> 17:19.666
The remainder of my crew,
some 200-odd U.S. Navy sailors,

17:19.701 --> 17:21.502
await our return aboard our destroyer,

17:21.536 --> 17:23.503
U.S.S. Nathan James, currently in the bay

17:23.538 --> 17:25.439
at the mouth of the river.

17:25.473 --> 17:29.844
We don't return by 2300
hours, they'll come looking.

17:29.911 --> 17:32.179
And rest assured, they will find us.

17:33.682 --> 17:37.084
So... why are you here, commander?

17:37.118 --> 17:38.519
We're just passing through.

17:38.553 --> 17:41.555
- Mm.
- Looking for food, supplies.

17:41.623 --> 17:44.425
Our man stepped on one of your traps.

17:44.459 --> 17:46.794
Yes, your man does not look so good.

17:46.828 --> 17:48.996
So the sooner we can get
him back to the ship...

17:49.030 --> 17:50.998
He is not gonna make it back to the ship,

17:51.032 --> 17:52.566
at least not alive.

17:52.601 --> 17:53.901
The poison in his veins
is gonna kill him soon,

17:53.935 --> 17:57.204
and I am the only one with the antidote.

17:57.239 --> 18:01.342
So... you can let us give
your man the help he needs,

18:01.376 --> 18:04.545
or you can continue with your, uh...

18:04.579 --> 18:06.046
Impotent threats.

18:06.114 --> 18:07.448
You decide.

18:07.482 --> 18:10.251
You give my man the antidote right now,

18:10.318 --> 18:14.521
and you better hope for
your sake it's not too late.

18:14.556 --> 18:16.590
John Wayne!

18:16.625 --> 18:18.826
Clint Eastwood.

18:18.894 --> 18:21.462
American macho.

18:21.496 --> 18:22.730
I don't suppose this guy's familiar

18:22.764 --> 18:24.698
with what a Tomahawk missile can do.

18:27.435 --> 18:29.603
You feel better?

18:29.671 --> 18:31.238
You think your power

18:31.273 --> 18:35.442
and not my generosity is
gonna help your man, huh?

18:39.586 --> 18:43.784
_

18:46.788 --> 18:48.889
I'm sure you are hungry.

18:48.924 --> 18:51.458
So we will dine...

18:51.493 --> 18:53.127
Commander.

19:10.956 --> 19:12.757
Hey! There you are.

19:12.791 --> 19:16.594
I was hoping you'd show up.
A little late for the party.

19:16.628 --> 19:19.730
What's mine is yours.

19:19.765 --> 19:21.599
Fish is pretty good.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.101
Freshly caught this morning, so I'm told.

19:24.136 --> 19:26.137
Team's not back yet.

19:26.171 --> 19:27.738
Heard as much.

19:29.274 --> 19:32.810
No flares either. It'll be dark soon.

19:32.844 --> 19:35.913
Yeah, they're probably all
sitting around a cozy campfire,

19:35.947 --> 19:38.349
telling ghost stories,
roasting marshmallows.

19:38.383 --> 19:43.120
What you saw in Guantanamo Bay...

19:44.790 --> 19:47.124
Some of the worst of human nature.

19:47.159 --> 19:48.459
Mm-hmm.

19:48.527 --> 19:50.127
And yet somehow

19:50.195 --> 19:53.764
you still managed to find the humor.

19:56.635 --> 20:00.438
Secret source of humor
is not joy but sorrow.

20:02.232 --> 20:04.241
Ain't no humor in heaven.

20:06.378 --> 20:09.113
Guy named Twain said that, more or less.

20:11.216 --> 20:12.917
You ever read "Huck Finn," "Tom Sawyer"?

20:12.951 --> 20:14.352
American classics.

20:14.386 --> 20:18.089
"Everyone is a moon who has a dark side,

20:18.156 --> 20:21.325
which he never shows to anybody."

20:21.360 --> 20:22.993
Yes, I know Twain.

20:23.863 --> 20:25.129
Well, then...

20:25.164 --> 20:27.732
We have something in common.

20:30.502 --> 20:33.004
Marshmallows, huh?

20:33.038 --> 20:34.672
No doubt.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.710
You must wonder how I managed
to achieve such opulence

20:38.744 --> 20:40.945
out here in the wilderness.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.414
We saw your yacht on our way up the river.

20:43.449 --> 20:47.385
Mm. My captain said the
waters would be much deeper.

20:47.453 --> 20:50.922
It turns out he was wrong,
yeah. It's impressive, no?

20:50.956 --> 20:52.390
It took my men one week

20:52.424 --> 20:54.859
to take everything off of the sinking ship.

20:54.927 --> 20:57.328
Please. Delgado, come join us. Sit, sit.

20:57.363 --> 20:59.797
This is Mayor Ervin Delgado,

20:59.865 --> 21:02.600
former Mayor of former town, Bocana Caoba.

21:02.635 --> 21:04.569
He and his people... they stumbled upon us,

21:04.637 --> 21:06.704
trying to escape the virus.

21:06.739 --> 21:08.706
Lucky for them, they found me.

21:08.741 --> 21:11.743
Lucky for you, they had tents.

21:11.777 --> 21:13.411
Can't imagine you thought of that,

21:13.445 --> 21:15.847
since you were expecting
to be living off your boat.

21:15.881 --> 21:18.216
Hmm.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.319
That's very perceptive. Bravo.

21:21.353 --> 21:22.954
And they sleep out there,

21:22.988 --> 21:24.589
on those filthy blankets

21:24.623 --> 21:26.224
with no shelter from the elements

21:26.258 --> 21:28.493
while you live like this?

21:28.560 --> 21:32.664
I don't expect you to
understand my methods, so, Bas.

21:32.698 --> 21:34.098
Explain to them.

21:34.133 --> 21:37.535
Society is based on the ancient Inca system

21:37.569 --> 21:40.305
of labor exchange known as mita.

21:40.339 --> 21:43.207
Our people provide the labor.

21:43.242 --> 21:45.109
El Toro provides the infrastructure

21:45.144 --> 21:47.078
and protection.

21:47.112 --> 21:49.948
- Protection?
- Yes, sir.

21:49.982 --> 21:52.583
Where we're from, we call that slavery.

21:52.618 --> 21:54.285
These people are alive

21:54.353 --> 21:57.889
while millions around the
world are not, because of me.

21:57.923 --> 21:59.524
These guards of mine,

21:59.558 --> 22:01.225
that trap that your man stepped on...

22:01.293 --> 22:03.061
These are the things that keep the people

22:03.128 --> 22:06.297
on the other side of the river
that are sick away from here.

22:06.332 --> 22:09.500
This is what keeps Delgado's people alive.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.069
Is that not right, Bas?

22:11.103 --> 22:12.870
- Yes, El Toro.
- Sí.

22:12.905 --> 22:14.672
Now please, eat, eat, eat, eat.

22:14.707 --> 22:16.874
The ladies have prepared the local delicacy

22:16.909 --> 22:18.710
for you to enjoy, so...

22:51.276 --> 22:52.744
I think his fever is going down.

22:52.778 --> 22:56.581
Whatever he gave him seems to be working.

22:56.615 --> 22:58.783
You think they're really
gonna let us leave here?

23:02.988 --> 23:05.623
So how is it that you made all your money?

23:05.657 --> 23:08.226
I'm guessing it wasn't ladies' handbags.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.694
No.

23:09.728 --> 23:12.463
I'm thinking cocaine. Heroin, maybe.

23:12.498 --> 23:14.132
Mm. Now you judge.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.767
I'm just trying to get a sense
for who we're dealing with.

23:15.801 --> 23:17.035
Mike.

23:17.069 --> 23:19.637
Hmm.

23:19.705 --> 23:23.007
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

23:23.042 --> 23:26.711
Ah, no, no, this... this is, uh...

23:26.745 --> 23:29.447
This is Karina. This is,
uh, the mayor's daughter.

23:29.481 --> 23:33.351
Mayor Delgado. Big man. Big family.

23:33.419 --> 23:37.321
All daughters, you know.
All very, very beautiful.

23:37.356 --> 23:40.925
And this one, Karina...
She is in her prime.

23:40.959 --> 23:42.660
Well, almost.

23:42.728 --> 23:45.530
Her younger sister... she's the real prize.

23:45.564 --> 23:48.599
No, no. ¿Qué eso?
¿Qué eso? Mi Amor, ven.

23:48.634 --> 23:51.035
- He is a pig.
- Karina!

23:51.070 --> 23:53.371
My father won't say it, but I will.

23:53.405 --> 23:55.840
No. Please, El Toro, she...
She means no disrespect.

23:55.908 --> 23:58.843
Bas. She called me "pig."

23:58.877 --> 24:00.211
She... she... she means no disrespect.

24:00.279 --> 24:03.448
You say you have a ship with guns and men.

24:03.482 --> 24:06.918
- Then do something!
- Karina, ¡Ya, ya!

24:06.952 --> 24:08.386
Disculpa, El Toro, disculpa.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.588
She's young. There is
nothing to be done here.

24:10.622 --> 24:12.523
She does not understand.

24:12.558 --> 24:15.359
We are safe from the plague,
and we are grateful to El Toro.

24:15.394 --> 24:17.728
Please tell him she has not provoked you.

24:17.763 --> 24:19.363
Please.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.769
Our only interest is getting
out of here with our man healthy.

24:30.342 --> 24:32.310
Sí, señor. Vámonos.

24:36.115 --> 24:39.584
I think maybe it's time
we checked on our man.

24:39.618 --> 24:41.119
No, I don't think so. You
have not finished your meal,

24:41.153 --> 24:43.721
and there are several things
that we need to discuss.

24:50.996 --> 24:54.132
Several of these were found on your boat.

24:54.199 --> 24:57.502
You want to explain to me what they're for?

24:57.536 --> 24:59.403
Like I told you, we need food.

24:59.438 --> 25:01.405
No fishing gear?

25:01.440 --> 25:03.774
You hunt with tranquilizer guns?

25:05.177 --> 25:07.478
I don't like being lied to, Captain,

25:07.546 --> 25:11.115
not after the hospitality
that I have extended to you.

25:13.452 --> 25:16.521
We're investigating the virus,

25:16.555 --> 25:17.989
trying to find the cause.

25:18.023 --> 25:20.258
We think it may come from the monkeys.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.994
That's why we were wearing the suits.

25:23.028 --> 25:25.863
You think the monkeys cause the virus?

25:25.898 --> 25:27.231
It's a theory.

25:27.299 --> 25:28.666
Huh.

25:28.700 --> 25:31.669
We have been living
amongst them for months.

25:31.703 --> 25:34.639
In fact, you just dined on them.

25:35.974 --> 25:40.578
If you needed monkeys,
all you had to do was ask.

25:40.646 --> 25:42.680
It's the secrets and dishonesty

25:42.714 --> 25:45.316
that lead to dangerous misunderstandings.

25:49.421 --> 25:51.522
So how many do you need?

26:01.934 --> 26:04.202
Well, got what we came for.

26:06.271 --> 26:08.673
¡Ya! ¡Ya, ya!

26:08.707 --> 26:10.474
No. Vámonos.

26:10.509 --> 26:12.677
Brandy?

26:12.711 --> 26:14.212
Thank you, no.

26:15.747 --> 26:19.884
You know, besides finding those cages,

26:19.952 --> 26:21.686
my men also found your radio.

26:21.753 --> 26:24.956
Apparently, it does not get a
signal out here in the jungle.

26:24.990 --> 26:27.358
Depends on which frequency you try.

26:27.426 --> 26:30.661
Our comms man is the one
who stepped on your spike.

26:30.729 --> 26:33.531
Yet you also brought flares.

26:33.565 --> 26:36.400
They provide our position.

26:36.435 --> 26:38.703
As a matter of fact,
we fired one just before

26:38.770 --> 26:41.072
we got off our boats outside your compound.

26:41.139 --> 26:43.407
So why the different colors?

26:43.442 --> 26:45.776
We use red during the
day and green at night.

26:45.811 --> 26:48.179
I believe something different.

26:49.781 --> 26:52.750
I believe green communicates "all is good,"

26:52.784 --> 26:54.418
and red means "danger."

26:54.486 --> 26:57.888
That's a universal language, no?

27:10.702 --> 27:12.203
Ma'am?

27:12.237 --> 27:14.272
The lookout just saw a new flare.

27:14.306 --> 27:15.740
Very low on the horizon,

27:15.774 --> 27:17.375
southwest of our current position.

27:17.409 --> 27:18.843
Green or red?

27:18.877 --> 27:20.177
Green, ma'am.

27:20.245 --> 27:21.579
Very well.

27:30.489 --> 27:31.722
Uhh!

27:34.993 --> 27:38.796
Four of them. Two of us. I like our odds.

27:38.830 --> 27:41.899
Working on a diplomatic solution here.

27:41.933 --> 27:43.901
And what about all these people?

27:43.935 --> 27:45.469
Not our mission.

27:45.504 --> 27:46.871
- No?
- No.

27:46.938 --> 27:51.208
Please! Help me, please!

27:51.243 --> 27:52.877
¡Por favor, no hagan esto!

27:54.980 --> 27:56.914
- Hey! What is this?
- They're taking her across the river!

27:56.948 --> 27:58.751
They're gonna leave her
with the infected people!

27:58.776 --> 27:59.550
No, no, no, no.

27:59.551 --> 28:01.085
Uhh!

28:07.459 --> 28:11.929
Help me, please!

28:11.997 --> 28:13.664
Papa! Please!

28:35.637 --> 28:38.543
Old leadbottom wants me back
to help him interrogate a spy

28:38.543 --> 28:40.907
- he caught on our island.
- It never gets old.

28:40.907 --> 28:43.276
On our island?!

28:43.344 --> 28:45.245
Must be some mistake.

28:45.279 --> 28:47.280
If there were any Japanese on
our island, we'd know about it.

28:47.770 --> 28:50.305
You're not getting much sleep, are you?

29:03.987 --> 29:05.253
Whoa. It's okay.

29:05.288 --> 29:07.723
It's okay. Just me. Everything's okay.

29:09.892 --> 29:11.994
Something's happened.

29:12.028 --> 29:13.528
No.

29:13.563 --> 29:15.697
No, I know it.

29:15.732 --> 29:17.766
We saw the flare a couple
of hours ago. It was green.

29:17.834 --> 29:20.302
Green's good.

29:20.336 --> 29:23.205
Trust me. It's just a dream.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.720
They killed her.

29:38.755 --> 29:40.989
Sons of bitches sent her
across the other side,

29:41.057 --> 29:42.290
let her die like that.

29:44.527 --> 29:48.063
I'm only gonna say this once.

29:49.532 --> 29:51.700
Release my men immediately.

29:51.734 --> 29:55.937
You Americans always in charge, right?

29:55.972 --> 29:58.240
Bas. The jefe.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.642
You could've left today with
your belly full of mangoes

30:00.676 --> 30:02.511
and a boat full of monkeys, but no, no, no.

30:02.545 --> 30:04.079
You just could not keep your nose

30:04.113 --> 30:05.981
out of other people's business!

30:06.015 --> 30:08.216
I don't know what happened here

30:08.284 --> 30:10.852
or what you're planning,
but let me remind you...

30:10.887 --> 30:14.022
Pfft. Your X.O. has already briefed me

30:14.057 --> 30:16.024
that you're gonna rain down holy hellfire

30:16.059 --> 30:18.160
on the whole jungle. I heard the threats.

30:18.194 --> 30:19.728
But you lost radio contact,

30:19.762 --> 30:22.030
and your ship does not
know where you are.

30:22.065 --> 30:23.398
So what are you gonna do?

30:23.466 --> 30:26.101
You gonna send us to the
other side of the river?

30:26.135 --> 30:29.204
You think I can maintain
a society without rules?

30:29.238 --> 30:30.605
Without consequences?

30:30.640 --> 30:34.076
It's the only reason why we are still here

30:34.110 --> 30:36.445
and the rest of the world dies around us.

30:36.479 --> 30:38.380
Come on. You call this a society?

30:48.624 --> 30:50.358
Commander.

30:53.029 --> 30:54.896
We're gonna keep your weapons, your suits,

30:54.931 --> 30:57.165
and the rest of your equipment.
You can have your men

30:57.200 --> 30:59.534
and your lives and your monkeys.

30:59.569 --> 31:02.504
That is the only offer that I give you.

31:02.538 --> 31:04.239
Is that clear?

31:04.273 --> 31:05.740
I understand.

31:12.682 --> 31:13.949
Oh.

31:13.983 --> 31:17.085
One more thing.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.255
If you're thinking of, uh,
sending drones or missiles,

31:20.323 --> 31:21.957
just wanna remind you that

31:21.991 --> 31:25.293
the children will be
sleeping in the tents with me.

31:27.630 --> 31:28.964
Starting here.

31:31.701 --> 31:33.201
No, no. Bas.

31:33.236 --> 31:34.469
No. Bas.

31:34.504 --> 31:36.404
- No.
- Bas.

31:36.439 --> 31:37.672
No!

31:40.276 --> 31:43.278
No!

32:05.168 --> 32:08.603
What happened? We got the monkeys?

32:08.638 --> 32:11.006
Yeah. We got the monkeys.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.642
Stop the boat.

32:13.709 --> 32:17.245
Stop the boat, Master Chief.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.980
This cannot stand.

32:19.015 --> 32:20.482
Sir, with all due respect...

32:20.516 --> 32:21.783
I know it's not our
mission, and I don't care.

32:21.817 --> 32:25.287
We cannot leave those people like that.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.596
I counted 13 guards...

32:31.596 --> 32:34.262
Seven in the tent compound,
four in the village.

32:34.297 --> 32:37.866
Two on the perimeter. At
night, they might up the ante,

32:37.900 --> 32:39.834
especially if they think
we might be turning around.

32:39.869 --> 32:41.870
Gentlemen, let's keep our heads cool.

32:41.904 --> 32:43.505
This is not the mission at hand.

32:43.539 --> 32:44.839
We're supposed to be saving the world.

32:44.874 --> 32:46.508
Shouldn't it be worth saving?

32:46.542 --> 32:50.011
If we had Burk and Tex and
weapons, maybe, but this?

32:50.079 --> 32:52.514
What if we don't make it back?
What happens to him, hmm?

32:52.548 --> 32:54.516
What's Dr. Scott gonna
do without the monkeys?

32:54.550 --> 32:56.318
What's our crew gonna
do without its leader?

32:56.352 --> 32:59.821
I have daughters. You have a daughter.

33:02.225 --> 33:03.992
Sir?

33:05.461 --> 33:07.929
We came to hunt.

33:29.187 --> 33:31.321
No.

34:00.818 --> 34:04.254
- Aah!
- Aah!

34:16.167 --> 34:17.400
No te preocupes.

34:26.409 --> 34:27.811
Tome poquito.

34:32.216 --> 34:33.850
Mm-hmm.

34:33.884 --> 34:37.721
Sí.

35:19.096 --> 35:22.198
Uhh!

35:32.576 --> 35:34.311
You can go help them.

35:35.813 --> 35:37.714
I can make it back myself if I have to.

36:51.722 --> 36:53.656
Aah! Aah!

37:08.372 --> 37:09.639
Uhh!

37:11.842 --> 37:14.377
- Aah!
- Aah!

37:20.818 --> 37:24.654
Go to sleep! Go to sleep.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.862
Aah!

37:38.569 --> 37:41.070
- ¿Dónde está El jefe?
- ¡Rio, Rio!

37:43.474 --> 37:44.727
_

37:44.752 --> 37:46.480
_

37:46.505 --> 37:48.244
_

37:48.245 --> 37:50.580
¡Vamos!

37:51.213 --> 37:54.672
_

37:59.757 --> 38:03.059
Aah!

38:13.637 --> 38:15.271
¡Por favor!

38:15.356 --> 38:17.801
_

38:17.801 --> 38:20.838
_

38:21.745 --> 38:24.047
You're finished, Bas.

38:24.081 --> 38:26.583
It's over.

38:26.617 --> 38:28.151
Drop the knife.

38:44.502 --> 38:45.935
Okay.

38:45.970 --> 38:48.071
I surrender.

38:48.105 --> 38:51.441
Come on. Show me that American justice.

38:51.475 --> 38:55.612
I'm sure I'll be fine on your ship.

38:55.646 --> 38:59.249
I've lived in considerably worse places.

38:59.283 --> 39:00.750
So arrest me! Come on! Huh?!

39:02.152 --> 39:03.987
Uhh!

39:05.289 --> 39:06.789
Aah!

39:23.474 --> 39:25.575
This place is yours now.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.114
Not mine.

39:34.184 --> 39:36.786
Ours.

39:38.222 --> 39:40.123
Mi hija.

40:02.346 --> 40:05.648
Just got word. They're on their way back.

40:05.683 --> 40:06.916
All of them?

40:06.951 --> 40:08.451
Mm-hmm. All of 'em.

40:08.519 --> 40:10.720
Uh, plus a boatload of monkeys.

40:14.992 --> 40:17.527
Told you there's nothing to worry about.

40:18.929 --> 40:21.364
Why not?

40:21.398 --> 40:22.699
Cheers.

40:22.766 --> 40:24.901
Cheers.

41:35.799 --> 41:40.799
