01:32.530 --> 01:36.330
War. Total war. A struggle for
survival.

01:37.425 --> 01:39.225
In this era of force and
destruction....

01:39.712 --> 01:42.912
...historians will argue. What was
the most influential factor.

01:44.261 --> 01:47.261
What was the most deadly
instrument? The most deadly weapon?

01:48.571 --> 01:52.571
Was it the overwhelming manpower?
Was it the blistering fire of the rockets?

01:58.453 --> 02:01.853
Was it the thundering mail from
heaven? The bombs, the blockbusters?

02:09.834 --> 02:12.834
Was it the lightening descention of
the parachute?

02:16.878 --> 02:18.878
Was it the whithering stutter of the
light machine-gun?

02:20.454 --> 02:24.254
Or the spectacle from the
commanding troops?

02:28.161 --> 02:30.961
Or the pattended tanks?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.200
Was it the flame-thrower?

02:34.801 --> 02:38.601
Or was it the screaming anger of faster
than sound, quicker than this: the B-2 rocket?

02:40.648 --> 02:44.448
No! It was none of these things.
The most effective, the most deadly....

02:43.905 --> 02:46.705
The most terrifying weapon of all
time was.

02:47.902 --> 02:50.102
Yes, you're right. The sergeant's
whistle.

02:52.136 --> 02:54.136
All right you guys, now I'm gonna
tell you something.

02:56.137 --> 03:00.137
The adjutant is coming, see? And
as usual the Colonel ain't very happy.

03:02.186 --> 03:08.586
And I ain't very happy either. Look
at this joint. It looks like Coney
Island on a Monday morning.

03:08.723 --> 03:10.523
- Hi Serg, what's the action?
- Have you seen Corwin?

03:11.247 --> 03:13.847
Yeah, I seen him, but I couldn't take
him so I sent him over to the mess
hall. He's on KP.

03:15.408 --> 03:16.608
- Okay, take them away.
- Right Serg.

03:18.492 --> 03:25.292
All right my friends. I want you to fall
out, spread out, and pick up everything
that ain't growing or nailed down.

03:56.253 --> 03:58.553
Let's go. Give us some food.
Come on, come on!

03:59.116 --> 04:00.616
Come on, let's have it.

04:00.748 --> 04:03.148
- What are they gripping about?
- Well, they've got to eat them.

04:03.483 --> 04:05.083
Well, I've got to cook them.

07:03.979 --> 07:05.379
Let's get out of here, it the
Sergeant.

07:15.776 --> 07:18.076
- What do you think you're cooking
around here? - Beans?

07:18.151 --> 07:21.551
Oh shut up! You've been getting
away with murder, and it's got to
stop. Understand? Shut up!

07:23.416 --> 07:26.216
Just because we were friends
before and used to work together,
I've been covering up for you.

07:26.869 --> 07:28.869
That's gotta stop too. Do you
understand? Shut up!

07:29.931 --> 07:33.931
Now get your pack and everything
that goes with it. I want to see you
down front in 5 minutes. Understand?

07:35.186 --> 07:36.186
Shut up!

07:36.675 --> 07:39.475
You're going to go on a long, long
journey and you may not be back
this way. Understand?

07:40.080 --> 07:40.880
Shut up!

07:46.381 --> 07:49.781
Get to packing, everything goes
with it, be down there in 5 minutes.
SHUT UP!

07:50.619 --> 07:52.219
Going on a long, long trip, might not
be there when you're finished.
SHUT UP!

07:53.300 --> 07:54.900
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

07:57.171 --> 07:59.771
It'll go under AR 605/300..

08:00.190 --> 08:03.190
before the CO can get it un 104 and
107.

08:04.490 --> 08:06.890
Now the record goes on WVA 20
and 24.

08:08.051 --> 08:10.451
He could be eligible for a 615/360.

08:11.305 --> 08:12.705
Section 7, paragraph 49.

08:12.794 --> 08:13.994
Oh sure, I get it.

08:21.930 --> 08:26.330
Sure and an MR19-2 and the profile
is 24.4.4.4D.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.158
Oh boy, I ain't in the army, I'm back
in the numbers racket.

08:31.096 --> 08:32.296
Here's the mail Corporal.

08:32.885 --> 08:35.684
Well, guess I'll take another crack at
that bandit. Do you think it will work?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.518
Should. There was a guy in here a
while ago who fixed it.

08:39.316 --> 08:40.316
Bout time.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.509
How do you like that? Now you
don't even get the nickel back.

08:52.285 --> 08:56.285
Crazy army. I asked for a transfer
again and they throw me right out of
Italian headquarters.

08:58.301 --> 09:00.901
Shawnessy, how many times do I
have to tell you that this ain't a day
room.

09:02.795 --> 09:04.795
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah, here.

09:05.101 --> 09:06.701
- Tell Sergeant McWell I want to see
him right away. - Right!

09:07.803 --> 09:09.403
- Is Miller in?
- Yeah.

09:13.358 --> 09:14.758
Hey Miller, what do you think we've
got here, midgets?

09:21.910 --> 09:23.310
Captain, what about this training
film here tomorrow morning?

09:24.265 --> 09:26.665
Oh yes.....that begins at 7 o'clock.

09:27.259 --> 09:30.859
The theater is 2 blocks away so I
think we'd better fall out at 6:35.

09:31.429 --> 09:32.629
They'll want us in front of ltalian
headquarters.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.167
Not later than 6:25.

09:35.266 --> 09:38.066
In that case Davenport, have the
men lined up and ready to go

09:38.430 --> 09:38.830
at...6:15.

09:42.005 --> 09:43.605
Serg, that guy is lost again.

09:44.115 --> 09:46.315
Well, you'd better find him.
- Right Serg.

09:48.533 --> 09:53.933
Hey, you see them lights? You see
that sign?

09:54.388 --> 09:55.988
Let's be turning them off.

09:56.776 --> 09:59.176
Sergeant McWeel, we've got to see
the work, don't we?

09:59.458 --> 10:03.258
Well, what if Colonel Davis comes?
He don't like lights on in the daytime.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.372
Another thing McWell, the company
has an early formation tomorrow and

10:08.116 --> 10:10.716
you'd better have those men fall out
at 5 minutes before 6.

10:12.053 --> 10:13.853
- 5 minutes before 6 huh?
- Yeah.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.248
I tell you, I've got some names here
that are cock-a-may-mes.

10:19.527 --> 10:23.727
...Rodowsky. ..Smellywesh...
Keselioshmiasch.

10:24.214 --> 10:27.214
Why don't we pull them out early,
say 5:45 huh?

10:27.414 --> 10:29.014
- Okay.
- Right Serg.

10:32.737 --> 10:34.737
Some day this guy is going to blow
his brains out.

10:35.361 --> 10:36.961
If you ask me, he's already done it.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.400
Yes sir. Yes Captain.

11:12.901 --> 11:13.901
Yes sir!

11:45.231 --> 11:46.831
See the first Sergeant in the other
room.

11:55.601 --> 11:58.601
Go around the outside. Through
that door.

12:04.378 --> 12:05.378
That door.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.850
I said that door.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.626
Got a cigarette? No, I quit.
- Can't afford it.

13:13.124 --> 13:14.324
There you are. Where've you
been?

13:15.304 --> 13:20.104
Fine looking specimen you are.
Get over there. Look at you! Look at this!

13:21.356 --> 13:25.956
Fix the helmet. Now get out on
the parade grounds. Ten times
round. Double time. Understand?

13:26.855 --> 13:28.855
Then come back here. I've got
plans for you.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.760
Go on, get the lead out of your
bucket.

13:34.354 --> 13:36.154
Wait a minute. Come here.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.450
Got a cigarette?

13:55.311 --> 13:57.111
- I've been arguing with him again.
- Oh yeah?

13:58.566 --> 14:01.166
I don't dig this army at all. I want
overseas....

14:02.004 --> 14:05.004
....I stay here. The guys that want
to stay here, get overseas.

14:05.604 --> 14:08.204
- You forget, there's a war on.
- Yeah, but what do we get to do about it?

14:09.084 --> 14:12.884
When I was a civilan, we had
something going every minute.
Singing, dancing, working in nightclubs.

14:13.543 --> 14:15.143
I join the army, I sit on my hands.

14:16.832 --> 14:19.632
I'm hungry. Think I'll inspect the
mess hall.

14:22.719 --> 14:26.119
- Hi ya Serg. Been waiting up for me?
- How come you're late Edwards?

14:26.896 --> 14:29.796
I was drunk. I don't blame you.
With a kisser like that, I'd be loaded
all the time.

14:31.195 --> 14:35.195
- Thank-you. - You're welcome, now
go to your barracks Edwards, get into
your  fatigues and report back here.

14:36.056 --> 14:39.256
And if you have any social
engagements, call your secretary
and have her cancel them.

14:45.038 --> 14:46.538
Sergeant's real brave today.

14:47.657 --> 14:49.057
I get any mail?

14:52.070 --> 14:53.670
Sure took you a long time to sober up.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.726
took me a long time to get drunk.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.300
My new girl had a date with another
Joe last night.

14:59.104 --> 15:00.704
What's the matter, losing your
appeal?

15:03.555 --> 15:05.355
Does that look like I'm losing my appeal?

15:06.228 --> 15:07.628
Wow! Very tasty.

15:19.194 --> 15:19.994
Hello.

15:20.718 --> 15:21.118
Hello.

15:21.413 --> 15:23.813
-Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?
- No, he's out.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.116
What did you want to see him
about?

15:27.214 --> 15:29.414
It's of a rather personal nature.

15:30.919 --> 15:34.719
- Would you like to leave a
message.
- Yes, just tell him Nelly was here.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.151
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

15:38.894 --> 15:42.494
On second thought, do you mind if I
sit here and wait for a while.

15:43.556 --> 15:45.756
- Oh no, go right ahead.
- Thanks.

15:49.768 --> 15:51.368
Clark, do you have that field....

15:52.405 --> 15:53.405
manual?

16:13.704 --> 16:15.904
I want four copies of this Clark, it is
to go to the ad agent.

16:17.655 --> 16:19.855
- But sir, I did this yesterday.
- Oh you did?

16:19.946 --> 16:20.746
Yes sir.

16:22.895 --> 16:25.695
So you did. Well, I want one more
copy.

16:26.374 --> 16:27.174
Yes, sir.

16:28.443 --> 16:33.243
You know, it takes a fantastic amound
of paperwork to administer even a little
tank company, such as we have here.

16:33.813 --> 16:35.213
Are you ready Ernie?

16:36.075 --> 16:38.275
Not yet dear. I'll be right with you.

16:39.181 --> 16:41.181
I've decided we can do without
another copy of this.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.738
- That's our commanding officer.
- Which one?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.994
Who in the company is that girl
married to?

16:54.041 --> 16:56.641
I don't know dear . Shall we call the
detectives?

16:57.493 --> 16:58.893
Now darling, don't get testy.

16:59.788 --> 17:04.088
just happen to know that she's the
tidiess little girl, she works on the
post, she had calcium deficiency, and...

17:04.965 --> 17:06.665
...she's expecting.

17:06.753 --> 17:09.654
- Expecting?
- Yes, and don't ask me what she's expecting.

17:09.925 --> 17:12.526
Where in the world did you uncover
all of this, Mrs. Shelock Holmes?

17:13.457 --> 17:14.656
At the clinic yesterday.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.933
I was there for my cold shot and
one of the nurses told me about her.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.404
Say, I just remembered, there's
been a mix-up in the OD roster.

17:23.174 --> 17:25.374
- I know.
- I may get it.

17:26.489 --> 17:29.689
No you won't. Lt. Tourrey is stuck
as officer of the day.

17:29.922 --> 17:31.722
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

17:31.869 --> 17:35.569
Sally Pearson told me, that the
adjutant's wife told her, that the
adjutant said so at noon.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.750
Oh well, if Sally said so, that settles it.

17:46.296 --> 17:47.896
How are you getting along with
Colonel Davis?

17:48.339 --> 17:50.939
Well, that depends. How are you
getting along with Mrs. Davis?

17:52.301 --> 17:54.501
That woman! She's so rank-
conscience.

17:56.377 --> 17:57.577
How soon will you be ready to leave?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.235
Why don't you go to the club and
wait. I have a lot of papers to sign.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.082
-Can't someone else sign those?
- I'm the only one.

18:05.937 --> 18:08.137
The United States Army has high
regard for my signature.

18:09.035 --> 18:11.435
I wish The First National Bank did.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.675
Where'd you get these clothes
Sergeant?

18:22.735 --> 18:27.535
- Quarter master sir.
- Why didn't you get a shipping
ticket when you got the clothes?

18:30.029 --> 18:34.029
I don't know sir. Maybe they
weren't paying attention when I
drew the issue?

18:37.111 --> 18:38.511
Then this is stolen goods.

18:40.362 --> 18:41.162
No sir.

18:41.355 --> 18:43.655
I think I'll have to have a look at
army regulations.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.240
But Lt. Davenport, don't you trust me?

18:46.121 --> 18:48.321
This is no way to run a business.
Carry on.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.149
He's going to tell me how to run a
business.

19:03.695 --> 19:06.095
He used to be a soda-jerk. He just
ran out of soda.

19:06.399 --> 19:09.799
- I got to see the First Sergeant.
- Hi ya kid. I see you're still wearing
your old hat.

19:10.822 --> 19:12.222
You leave me alone. I got troubles.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.852
In the army? You got troubles?

19:14.800 --> 19:16.800
Yeah, and I gotta see the First
Sergeant right away! It's important.

19:17.498 --> 19:18.298
Take it easy...

19:18.700 --> 19:20.300
Don't tell me how to take it. I got to
get a three-day pass.

19:20.634 --> 19:23.634
Last guy in the army that got a
three-day pass, was Sergeant York.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.734
Yeah, well I don't care. I got to see
my wife. It's an emergency.

19:27.631 --> 19:30.031
I've had emergencies, but could I
get a pass?

19:30.702 --> 19:31.702
Bet you were never having a baby.

19:32.508 --> 19:35.108
Kid, I've never even
had my appendics out.

19:36.165 --> 19:38.165
- Corwin!
-Yes sir.

19:39.629 --> 19:41.629
- Did you do those penalty tours?
-Yes Corporal.

19:41.650 --> 19:43.250
- Did you report to the drill
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

19:43.412 --> 19:44.612
- Did you report to the mess
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

19:45.150 --> 19:45.750
Okay.

19:46.475 --> 19:50.221
Boy, if I ever get overseas, the first
thing I'm gonna do is surrender.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.330
Concentration camps have got to
be better than this.

19:54.613 --> 19:57.813
What crumby coffee. Why I
wouldn't wash my......

19:57.557 --> 19:58.357
Hey! It's here, the shipping order.

19:59.397 --> 20:01.197
-Came while you were out.
-Now watch me get out of this hole.

20:01.906 --> 20:03.306
- Hey Serg, I wanna....
- What do you want?

20:03.904 --> 20:06.904
- Nothing. I just thought that maybe I....
- Get out of my way. Can't you see
I'm busy?

20:09.019 --> 20:12.019
Captain Caldwell, I've just seen the
shipping orders and I have just the
man for you sir.

20:12.598 --> 20:13.598
Good. Who is he?

20:13.619 --> 20:15.019
Me! First Sergeant Victor
Puccinelli.

20:16.054 --> 20:16.854
Don't be foolish Sergeant.

20:17.811 --> 20:21.611
This call is only for Privates and
PFC's. You'd better make up your
mind, you're staying here.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.280
- I've seen.....
-  I won't argue that point.

20:25.377 --> 20:29.177
Now, about this shipment. We can't
be expected to cripple ourselves, so.....

20:30.295 --> 20:31.495
....don't send anyone who is useful.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.097
How about that kid that never
doesn anything right?

20:34.498 --> 20:36.098
- You mean Corwin?
- That's the one.

20:36.771 --> 20:37.771
He's right out here now sir.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.620
Maybe Eisenhower can do
something with him.

20:42.189 --> 20:42.989
Yes sir.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.077
Corwin!

20:47.038 --> 20:49.438
- I want to see you.
- I've been wanting to see you too Vic.

20:49.663 --> 20:50.263
I wanted to know if....

20:50.460 --> 20:52.060
Get you hands off my desk and call
me Sergeant.

20:53.124 --> 20:55.224
- Can't you stand up?
- Yes Sergeant.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.397
I just wanted to know if I could get a
three-day pass.

20:59.836 --> 21:00.736
What'd you say?

21:02.149 --> 21:03.349
I want to know if I can get a three-
day pass?

21:03.543 --> 21:05.543
Did you get permission from your
platoon Sergeant to come in here?

21:05.990 --> 21:06.390
No, Sergeant, but I....

21:06.891 --> 21:09.691
How many times must I tell you that
in the army you must go through channels.

21:10.288 --> 21:14.588
Yeah, but this is an emergency and if I go
through the section leader and the platoon
sergeant and you and everbody else, ...

21:14.750 --> 21:18.050
...my kid will be old enough to be
drafted himself.

21:19.175 --> 21:20.175
Very funny.

21:20.816 --> 21:23.016
I can't be giving you a three-day
pass every week.

21:23.376 --> 21:24.176
You just came off one.

21:24.755 --> 21:26.655
That's not true. I haven't been on
one in a long time.

21:27.026 --> 21:29.426
And if my wife forgets what I look
like, you'll be responsible.

21:29.850 --> 21:32.650
You should get that lucky. We'll see
about it when the time comes.

21:34.021 --> 21:35.621
- You heard me.
- Yes Sergeant.

21:36.092 --> 21:38.292
- Aren't we going to rehearse our
act for the show? - Oh get going.

21:40.504 --> 21:41.904
Wait a minute. Come here.

21:43.395 --> 21:44.795
How come you didn't shave today?

21:45.428 --> 21:48.428
I didn't know I was suppose to. I didn't
shave yesterday and nobody said nothing.

21:48.704 --> 21:49.904
Get out of here.

21:53.057 --> 21:54.657
You didn't always used to treat me
like this.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.613
Oh stop mumbling.

21:56.218 --> 21:58.618
you didn't always used to treat me
like this, that's what I said, so there so.

21:59.489 --> 22:01.489
- Are you going to start that again?
-Yes, I am.

22:01.568 --> 22:04.768
You're suppose to be my friend.
We lived on the same block, in the
same city.

22:05.528 --> 22:06.528
And you know what you promised
my mother.

22:07.362 --> 22:09.362
Stop hitting my desk. And what did
I promise your mother?

22:09.908 --> 22:11.108
That no one would harm a hair on
my head.

22:11.718 --> 22:12.518
You mean both heads.

22:12.698 --> 22:13.298
Ho, ho! That's rich!

22:14.532 --> 22:16.532
Oh quiet pea-head. Just cause we
were friends before...

22:17.541 --> 22:18.541
Friends before is right.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.405
Anything to do with now .

22:20.610 --> 22:22.010
I have a responsibility and you're
part of it.

22:22.563 --> 22:23.963
I'm warning you, you're driving me
crazy.

22:24.351 --> 22:25.751
That's no drive, that's a short putt.

22:27.409 --> 22:29.009
Ah what do you want? Special
privileges?

22:28.993 --> 22:31.993
No, I just want to remember you as the best
man at my wedding. You're not kidding.

22:32.891 --> 22:35.691
We were buddies, and we wrote
songs, and we dansed and we sang together.

22:36.578 --> 22:38.778
And you still owe me 8 dollars and
75 cents, since before the war.

22:39.377 --> 22:41.377
And we was friends and family. We
was just like brother and sister.

22:42.156 --> 22:45.956
And what happens? Along comes a
crumby little war and clip-clap, you
turn into a Dr. Jerkyll and Mr. Clyde.

22:46.619 --> 22:47.819
What is it with you anyhow?

22:48.072 --> 22:51.072
- Okay. ..okay. ..
- Okay. ..okay. ..Big man!

22:52.507 --> 22:54.907
Couple of stinking stripes. Big deal!

22:55.182 --> 22:58.182
- Go home and wash your face.
- Go home and wash your face.

22:58.809 --> 23:02.009
Big deal. Look at him, General
Delivery.

23:02.919 --> 23:04.119
Get out of here.

23:06.824 --> 23:08.424
What's the matter with Einstein?

23:08.227 --> 23:09.027
He thinks I bombed Pearl Harbour.

23:10.234 --> 23:13.034
When Edwards comes back, tell
him he's being shipped out.

23:13.178 --> 23:14.978
- Say, there was a Nelly here
looking for you. - Millie?

23:16.599 --> 23:18.499
Wonder what she wants? Oh,
what's the date?

23:19.350 --> 23:22.150
- The 29th.
- That's it! Tomorrow is the
anniversary of our first alert.

23:22.570 --> 23:24.370
Alert? This office has never been
alerted.

23:24.918 --> 23:26.518
I know it. I just used it as a gag.

23:27.576 --> 23:29.576
You know the first time I saw Nelly,
she looked real good to me.

23:30.019 --> 23:31.619
-But all I got was ice-cubes.
- So?

23:32.302 --> 23:34.502
-So I told her we were being
alerted. - So?

23:35.627 --> 23:37.027
So she let me kiss her.

23:37.256 --> 23:37.856
So?

23:38.423 --> 23:40.623
- So, I took her out a few more
times. - So?

23:40.988 --> 23:43.188
- So, she let me kiss her a few more
times. - What's wrong with that?

23:44.463 --> 23:47.863
Nothing, expect one day she
started to talk and I found out how
dumb she was.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.888
You know that dame is really 60
cents short.

23:51.671 --> 23:53.671
Not only that. She got on a getting-
married kick.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.499
What is it with these dames? They
all want to get married?

23:57.079 --> 23:58.479
I know a lot of nice people that
aren't married.

23:59.070 --> 24:00.470
Then one night I took her out....

24:04.185 --> 24:08.185
Yes sir! Yes sir! Right sir!

24:09.292 --> 24:12.092
After you tell Edwards he's being
shipped out, send him into Miller..

24:12.613 --> 24:13.613
...to have his supply record checked
out. Right.

24:32.799 --> 24:36.599
Hello! You're that cute Corporal that
was here when I came before, aren't you?

24:37.220 --> 24:39.420
Yes, but the Sergeant still isn't in.

24:40.292 --> 24:44.292
I don't suppose you know if he's going
to stay in camp tonight or tomorrow night?

24:45.235 --> 24:49.035
- No you see, we never know when
we're going to be alerted. - I know.

24:49.658 --> 24:52.058
Ours is not the reason why. Ours is
to do or die.

24:53.344 --> 24:54.544
That's cute.

24:55.056 --> 24:57.056
Look, why don't you write him a
note.

24:58.338 --> 25:01.338
Write him? Well, you do it.

25:02.447 --> 25:06.247
Just say: I'll be back at 6:45 when I
get off from work.

25:07.728 --> 25:09.328
And put down it's important.

25:10.871 --> 25:13.671
And if I don't see him, there might
be trouble.

25:15.433 --> 25:19.433
Okay. If I see him. You know, he's
not the easiest guy in the world to locate.

25:20.803 --> 25:21.803
Don't I know it.

25:22.716 --> 25:27.116
Well, I have to get back to the PX.
We're terribly busy today, we're closed.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.547
Closed for inventory.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.818
Good-bye.

25:37.394 --> 25:38.794
Well, they did it again.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.990
The adjutant just stuck me with
Officer of the Day.

25:41.381 --> 25:42.781
- I know.
- You know?

25:43.822 --> 25:46.222
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- My wife just told me.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.490
Did she also mention when the war
would be over?

25:50.467 --> 25:52.067
She doesn't tell me everything she
knows.

25:58.669 --> 26:00.869
- Clark?
- It's okay. She's gone.

26:02.262 --> 26:03.262
What Millie have to say?

26:03.796 --> 26:05.796
She left you a note. She said she'd
be back 6:45.

26:07.456 --> 26:08.456
Come in.

26:08.941 --> 26:09.741
No.

26:10.155 --> 26:12.355
- But Sergeant!
- Have you got permission to come in here?

26:13.675 --> 26:15.275
- No.
- Well get out.

26:16.311 --> 26:19.111
They think all I have to do around
here is hand out passes. Now,
what was I talking about?

26:19.711 --> 26:22.311
Nelly. She said if she doesn't see
you tonight, there's going to be trouble.

26:23.097 --> 26:24.297
I'd better catch the first bus into town.

26:25.595 --> 26:29.395
- Hey Corporal. Would you know where I can...
- Hey! Douse them lights. The Colonel's coming.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.909
The offices too.

26:37.310 --> 26:41.510
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry sir, but the
Colonel is coming and you know
how he feels about lights burning in the daytime.

26:42.341 --> 26:44.341
- And you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do sir.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.712
- All clear.
- Okay, turn them on.

26:57.318 --> 26:58.118
Hey, where's Corwin?

26:58.126 --> 27:01.926
He's been running in and out of
here all day long, and if it keeps up,
we're going to have to put in a revolving door.

27:02.694 --> 27:03.894
Does he got permission to skip training?

27:04.664 --> 27:06.064
No and you'd better find him and
we'll send him to the CO.

27:06.846 --> 27:07.446
Right Serg!

27:07.750 --> 27:10.150
And another thing. Edwards and
these guys are shipping overseas.

27:11.508 --> 27:12.308
Come in.

27:12.379 --> 27:13.379
Come in.

27:14.126 --> 27:17.126
- Get out of here.
- Come back.

27:19.427 --> 27:22.527
You need to be explaining why you
haven't been in no classes this afternoon.

27:22.547 --> 27:24.747
- I've been looking all over for you Mc Vie.
- Oh, you've been looking for me huh?

27:25.364 --> 27:27.164
Yeah, can I have permission to see
the first Sergeant?

27:27.403 --> 27:28.003
No!

27:28.404 --> 27:30.604
- But I gotta see him.
- You don't gotta see nobody!

27:31.344 --> 27:33.744
I've got a message for the first
Sergeant from battalion headquarters.

27:34.243 --> 27:35.643
- Why didn't you say so?
- He didn't let me.

27:36.213 --> 27:37.413
Corwin, will you never learn?

27:37.778 --> 27:41.378
You know, before you take off on
detail, you gotta tell your platoon Sergeant.

27:45.587 --> 27:46.787
All right! What's the message?

27:49.478 --> 27:52.678
It says you gotta report to the dispensory
in the morning for a physical examination.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.539
Physical!?! Let me see that.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.775
My application went through.

27:57.256 --> 27:58.256
Serg, you need me for anything?

27:58.600 --> 28:00.200
No, take two weeks off.

28:02.966 --> 28:06.166
Wait a minute Serg. Form 38 is
filled out in case of discharge.

28:06.861 --> 28:08.661
- Discharge? What does that mean?
- Oh he's right Sergeant.

28:09.527 --> 28:15.927
According to paragraph 8, article
40-100, 24 hours prior to discharge
of an enlisted man,

28:16.173 --> 28:21.573
for reasons other than disability, he
must be examined and form 38 filled out.

28:22.375 --> 28:23.775
They can't do this to me.

28:24.524 --> 28:25.724
- Sergeant!
- What?

28:25.817 --> 28:27.317
When you get home, will you call
my mother?

28:27.608 --> 28:28.608
Get out of here.

28:29.286 --> 28:32.286
I'll refuse. I'll go in and tap his head
with a 4x4.

28:33.358 --> 28:37.358
Captain Corwin, can you tell me
about this? They want to discharge me.

28:38.923 --> 28:40.923
- Now Serg.
- Go ahead and read it for yourself.

28:43.366 --> 28:45.766
Sergeant Goosenelly. Nelly will be......

28:45.966 --> 28:46.966
No, no, no

28:54.417 --> 28:56.617
WDA...Form 30...

28:58.342 --> 29:02.142
Oh calm yourself Sergeant. Your applicatioin
for warrant-officer has come through.

29:03.355 --> 29:06.155
You're being discharged to accept
the appointment as warrant-officer.

29:06.299 --> 29:08.099
Me an officer? Well, that's worse.

29:09.154 --> 29:10.954
- Sergeant.
- Yes sir?

29:11.612 --> 29:13.812
Will you make out tomorrow's
morning report and send it to battalion.

29:14.613 --> 29:15.613
Morning report tonight?

29:16.681 --> 29:18.681
Yes, from now on, they want it in
the night before.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.845
- It's a discharge, so I can become a
warrant-officer. - Congratulations!

29:29.024 --> 29:30.024
Hey what's this deal about me
shipping out?

29:30.705 --> 29:33.105
It's no deal. You're just on a movement.
You'll be leaving in a couple of days.

29:33.711 --> 29:35.911
Look Serg. How about crossing my
name off that list?

29:37.245 --> 29:39.045
You know, I've got a new girl in town
and we're pretty serious.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.580
- That's very touching.
- Listen, I've got to see my girl.

29:42.043 --> 29:44.043
I've seen the girls you go with.
You'll do better where you are going.

29:44.814 --> 29:46.414
Yeah? Well, I've seen your type too.

29:47.164 --> 29:48.764
Well, why don't you drop down to
Realdo theater sometime?

29:49.722 --> 29:51.322
- Renaldo?
- Yeah, the new red-headed usher.

29:51.395 --> 29:52.995
- Helen?
- Yeah, that's right.

29:53.045 --> 29:54.245
Well I'm a dirty, low-down, no-
good....

29:55.025 --> 29:56.625
You win that argument. Go ahead,
start another one.

29:57.418 --> 29:58.818
You're cutting in on me. I go with
Helen.

29:59.348 --> 30:01.948
-You went with Helen.
- Now I see why I'm on shipment.

30:02.677 --> 30:03.877
You're pulling your rank on me.

30:04.298 --> 30:07.098
Don't do it Serg. 96 article of war .
Sock him and the Captain will bust you.

30:09.173 --> 30:10.973
Put this on the bulletin board.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.320
Sgt. Puccinilli, Millie will be here at
6:45. There may be a problem.

30:20.506 --> 30:23.506
You can take off wise guy and start
packing. I've got work to do.

30:24.981 --> 30:26.381
- This ain't no poolroom.
- No?

30:27.340 --> 30:29.940
- I could have sworn I just saw an eightball.
- Get out of here.

31:02.347 --> 31:04.547
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm singing.

31:04.726 --> 31:05.926
You call that singing?

31:06.512 --> 31:08.712
- Didn't you like it a little?
- I didn't even like it a lot.

31:09.716 --> 31:11.116
You have to admit, my voice is
different.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.192
Come on Serg, let's hear you sing it.

31:13.661 --> 31:15.861
I can't. I've got some work to do
and besides, I've got a date in town.

31:16.933 --> 31:19.133
Come on Sergeant!

31:19.186 --> 31:20.186
Okay. One chord.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.670
All right boys. Let's get going.
Come on.

33:35.293 --> 33:37.293
- How long before Miller gets here?
- About 20 minutes.

33:37.742 --> 33:40.742
I'd like to find the joker that spread
the rumor around that I'm already a
warrant-officer.

33:41.592 --> 33:42.192
Why?

33:42.193 --> 33:45.093
Every time I walk into the barracks
some nitwick shout Attention!

33:56.005 --> 33:59.005
Okay you lucky people. You can
get ready and go to town now . I'm
ready to take over.

33:59.565 --> 34:01.165
Take that junk into the Captain's
office.

34:02.000 --> 34:02.800
And take that with you!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.800
Hey Corwin, give me a hand will
you?

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
Well I guess that wraps things up
Clark. Go on, get home to the little woman.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.600
Thanks Serg! See you in the
morning.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.199
I'll be back in a minute. Hey Corwin.
Don't forget you have to polish up outside too.

34:20.400 --> 34:25.000
Hey Shawnessay. Some dame
might drop in here asking for me, so
tell her I'm out running the obstacle course.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.000
Okay.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.900
You know Shawnessay, I kind of
wish Mc Vie would cut this throat.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.800
How could he blow his whistle?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.900
You know, some people say when
you get in the army, you get used to it.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
But they don't say how long it takes,
and I ain't getting any younger.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.199
- You know something Corwin?
- Hey Corporal!

34:53.693 --> 34:55.293
I guess I'll get me a couple of
beers...

34:55.562 --> 34:57.362
- So, going to wet your whistle eh?
- You bet.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.400
Come on, let's be hurrying.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.723
Hey, there's something you missed.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.301
Let's be getting on the ball.

35:16.312 --> 35:17.512
Yeah, but nobody can see up there
Sergeant.

35:17.931 --> 35:19.131
That don't make no difference!

35:20.781 --> 35:22.581
It's awful sloppy around here.

35:25.451 --> 35:26.251
You gotta be neat.

35:27.580 --> 35:28.780
You gotta be tidy.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.480
Cause if we ain't, somebody's
gonna get it.

35:34.798 --> 35:37.398
This army ain't just a place to have
fun you know.

35:39.058 --> 35:42.058
Well, if anybody asks for me, I'm
painting the town.

35:43.739 --> 35:47.339
And when I'm painting the town..

35:49.895 --> 35:51.295
..I'm painting the town.

35:52.577 --> 35:53.777
Big man.

35:58.191 --> 35:59.591
Gotta be neat.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.184
Gotta be tidy.

36:08.452 --> 36:10.252
Here's something you missed.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.933
Let's be getting on the ball.

36:15.651 --> 36:16.951
Yeah, but Sergeant, nobody can
see tthat.

36:17.066 --> 36:18.666
That don't make no difference!

36:22.605 --> 36:26.405
If anybody asks for me, I'll be out
painting the town.

36:30.387 --> 36:31.987
And when I paint the town...

36:34.666 --> 36:35.866
...I'm painting the town.

36:36.173 --> 36:37.173
Take it easy son.

36:37.742 --> 36:40.542
Why does that Mc Vie have to be in
the army? Why couldn't he be in the navy?

36:41.525 --> 36:43.325
I can't sleep in the afternoon on
account of that guy.

36:43.408 --> 36:44.808
Why don't you take a poke at him?

36:45.601 --> 36:47.001
Me take a poke at Sergeant Mc Vie?

36:47.262 --> 36:47.662
You know what they'd do to me?

36:47.742 --> 36:50.942
What can they do to you? There's
nothing lower than what you are now.

36:51.067 --> 36:53.467
Look, in the regualtions, it says that
you can challenge anybody in the army.

36:54.363 --> 36:56.963
If you think they're taking advantage of
you, ask them to put the gloves on with you.

36:58.244 --> 37:00.244
You mean I could sock Sergeant
Mc Vie in the nose and nobody
would say nothing?

37:00.921 --> 37:02.121
Suuuure.

37:02.985 --> 37:04.585
- What if he hit me first?
- But you don't let him.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.601
You see it's a matter of science lad.
Come here, I'll show you.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.920
Strike a pose.

37:13.713 --> 37:15.313
See first you gotta take a style.

37:16.717 --> 37:17.917
John L. Sullivan.

37:19.732 --> 37:20.732
No, that's not for you.

37:21.994 --> 37:23.394
Wait a minute. The Jack Dempsey
crouch.

37:25.552 --> 37:27.352
That's better. You're a killer!

37:27.955 --> 37:30.555
Get low! Lower , lower.

37:36.158 --> 37:37.558
Hey I got it. Come here.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.723
Toni Cassaneri. That's it.

37:42.508 --> 37:43.908
He was a ballet dancer.

38:02.290 --> 38:04.790
Oh no. Look, you gotta have
rhythm. Watch.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.680
Corwin. Come here.

38:32.127 --> 38:33.527
- What are you doing?
- I'm training.

38:34.148 --> 38:34.748
For what?

38:34.788 --> 38:36.788
- I'm going to put the gloves on with
Sergeant Mc Vie. - Mc Vie?

38:38.054 --> 38:39.054
Yeah, I'm going to jab his head off.

38:39.059 --> 38:40.059
Where do you want the body sent?

38:41.122 --> 38:43.522
- Send it to Mc Vie's parents.
-Your body!

38:44.009 --> 38:45.609
Go on, get in and finish the rest of
your work.

38:51.935 --> 38:53.335
- Vic.
- No!

38:54.702 --> 38:55.902
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?

38:56.505 --> 38:57.305
All right. What do you want now?

38:57.884 --> 39:00.084
- Remember that song we wrote together?
- Yeah, what about it?

39:00.668 --> 39:02.368
Well, we got a telegram fromt he
music publisher and he...

39:03.031 --> 39:05.031
..wants us to put the song on a
record and send it to him right away.

39:05.501 --> 39:06.701
Go ahead and make a record of it.

39:07.227 --> 39:08.027
No, I want you should record it.

39:08.522 --> 39:09.722
Get Bing Crosby.

39:11.126 --> 39:11.926
I like you better.

39:12.521 --> 39:14.721
Oh you don't have to fight Mc Vie.
You're punchy already.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.927
Why? Just cause I like you better?

39:18.104 --> 39:20.104
At least you could do, is show a
little consideration for me.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.720
Sure, I know you're a sergeant and
I'm only a private.

39:24.208 --> 39:25.608
At least you could do, is be a little
friendly.

39:26.025 --> 39:28.025
All right. I love you, I'm your friend.
What do you want me to do?

39:28.459 --> 39:31.859
If you never ever give me a pass
again, I don't care. Just take this
song into town tonight.

39:32.463 --> 39:34.063
You know that place where you put
a quarter in the machine...

39:34.793 --> 39:36.993
...instead of writing home to your
mother, you send your voice on a record.

39:43.566 --> 39:45.566
- Here's a quarter.
- But I got a date.

39:45.670 --> 39:47.670
So what? Take your date to the
recording booth with you.

39:48.896 --> 39:51.296
Might be a little warm, might be a
little fun.

39:52.039 --> 39:53.039
All right. I'll record it.

39:54.188 --> 39:55.588
Millie!

39:57.511 --> 39:58.511
I'll be seeing you.

40:01.202 --> 40:02.002
Come in.

40:04.434 --> 40:05.234
Oh hello.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.304
Hello. Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?

40:08.895 --> 40:12.695
- Oh no, he out on a bizzwhack.
- Oh that's a shame. How'd it happen?

40:14.621 --> 40:16.221
Say, haven't I seen you someplace
before?

40:17.445 --> 40:22.445
You might have seen me at the PX.
Number 10. I used to sell beer.

40:23.036 --> 40:25.236
But I asked to be transfered to the
candy counter.

40:26.143 --> 40:27.343
What happened? Did you get
hungry?

40:27.586 --> 40:29.186
- Good-evening Corporal.
- Oh hi.

40:29.768 --> 40:30.768
Aren't you going to introduce us?

40:31.870 --> 40:34.670
Private Edwards meet a friend.
Friend, meet Private Edwards.

40:35.216 --> 40:36.016
Your name's Millie, isn't it?

40:36.547 --> 40:38.347
Millie doesn't look it, but she just
switched from beer to candy.

40:39.329 --> 40:41.129
Would you like to take your break
now Corporal?

40:42.057 --> 40:43.057
Definetly.

40:44.034 --> 40:44.834
Glad to have met you.

40:45.425 --> 40:47.625
Oh thank-you. If you want
anything, just ring for the bellboy.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.680
He's nice, isn't he?

40:51.734 --> 40:56.334
- Do you think Cutie will be here tonight?
- Cutie? Do you mean Puccinelli?`

40:57.782 --> 40:59.782
No, I don't think he can make it.

41:00.204 --> 41:03.004
But anything you want to tell him,
why you can tell me.

41:05.762 --> 41:09.762
What's your name? The charge of
quarters was so crazy when he
introduced us...

41:10.703 --> 41:13.703
..is all that I remember is that you're
a friend of his.

41:14.719 --> 41:18.519
U.S. That's cute. Monogrammed
blankets.

41:22.712 --> 41:25.312
My name is Caldwell. Private Ernie
Caldwell.

41:25.987 --> 41:28.587
I was just thinking that if you're not
doing anything tomorrow night..

41:29.020 --> 41:29.820
Oh tomorrow night.

41:31.613 --> 41:32.213
Hello.

41:33.731 --> 41:35.731
Don't you know enough to knock
before you come into a room?

41:36.710 --> 41:39.710
Gee whis. I was just down at the
PX and I thought that Corporal
Shawnessay would like some ice- cream.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.806
Set it on the desk. I'll see that he
gets it.

41:48.782 --> 41:49.982
The spoon's inside.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.386
We'll keep this between the two of us.

42:03.575 --> 42:05.175
You don't got to worry about me.
I'm no snitcher.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.560
Got a cigarette?

42:38.061 --> 42:39.861
Corporal I've got to get into town
right away. Can I get a pass?

42:40.459 --> 42:41.259
Are you nuts? You're restricted.

42:41.395 --> 42:43.595
But the fellas forgot the music. I've
got to have a pass.

42:43.779 --> 42:44.579
Nothing doing.

42:44.940 --> 42:45.940
Corporal it's a matter of life and
death.

42:46.218 --> 42:47.418
Nothing doing.

44:32.968 --> 44:35.768
Can you sing Melancholy Baby?

44:36.384 --> 44:38.784
- No!
- That's okay, I'm glad.

44:39.504 --> 44:41.704
I hate that Melancholy Baby.

45:04.272 --> 45:05.872
I beg your pardon, did you see..

45:07.084 --> 45:09.484
I beg your pardon. Oh never mind.

45:13.484 --> 45:17.484
Hey Charlie. What was that?

45:18.104 --> 45:19.304
I don't know Serg.

45:20.512 --> 45:21.512
Excuse me..

45:23.229 --> 45:24.829
I beg your pardon.

45:26.671 --> 45:28.071
Did you see what I saw?

45:47.286 --> 45:48.686
Here's a light.

45:49.672 --> 45:50.872
What'll you have?

45:51.047 --> 45:52.847
Creme d'cassise.

45:53.901 --> 45:56.101
Creme d'cassise?

46:25.548 --> 46:27.948
Excuse me little lady. How about a
little drink? Please!

46:31.233 --> 46:34.233
-Hey, can you sing Melancholy Baby?
- Bartender!

46:34.941 --> 46:36.141
All right Romeo.

46:36.737 --> 46:39.937
I'm just buying a little drink for
Melancholy Baby.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.099
You've had enough Serg.

46:43.838 --> 46:47.838
I ain't going to stop drinking, until
she starts looking good to me.

46:57.219 --> 47:01.019
You're the first dame I ever met..

47:01.195 --> 47:04.195
..who didn't remind of any other
dame I ever met.

47:06.325 --> 47:07.325
Bartender, How much
do I owe you?

47:08.208 --> 47:09.408
A half a buck.

47:15.889 --> 47:17.889
- Thank-you.
- Thank-you! You've been very nice.

47:17.902 --> 47:21.302
-What were you saying?
- How about singing a little song?

47:23.031 --> 47:25.231
A little song for soldier? Would you
like ah...

47:25.687 --> 47:27.687
good-night song? Or a...

47:28.998 --> 47:31.798
...children's song? Or a

47:33.301 --> 47:35.501
..foolish song?

47:38.092 --> 47:39.292
Oh I'm awfully sorry.

47:44.328 --> 47:45.528
- Will you play this please?
- Oh sure.

49:52.883 --> 49:55.683
-It's me Alvin.
- Alvin? What on earth are you
doing in that outfit? Are you nuts?

49:56.982 --> 49:59.582
- Me nuts?
- You guys ran off and forgot the music.

49:59.622 --> 50:00.222
What if you get caught?

50:00.614 --> 50:03.814
Never mind. Get Puc in that
recording booth. We got to have
those records the first thing in the morning.

50:04.166 --> 50:05.366
He's over there.

50:09.126 --> 50:11.126
- Now as I was saying.
- Yes Vic?

50:11.910 --> 50:15.910
Helen, you look so wonderful
tonight. Could I interest you in a
slightly used kiss?

50:18.476 --> 50:19.276
Now what do you guys want?

50:19.715 --> 50:21.115
We had to go back to camp. We
forgot the music.

50:21.617 --> 50:23.417
Well don't bother me. Give it to
Sam at the piano.

50:24.256 --> 50:25.256
Okay Serg.

50:30.147 --> 50:33.147
- What's the matter Vic?
- Oh nothing. Just one of those things.

50:33.325 --> 50:34.925
Come on. What is it?

50:35.715 --> 50:37.315
- I didn't want to tell you...
- But what?

50:38.631 --> 50:40.231
- We're being alerted.
-Alerted?

50:41.986 --> 50:43.186
But Vic.

50:43.987 --> 50:45.587
Well what am I going to do when
you're gone?

50:46.352 --> 50:47.952
Why Helen, are you going to miss
me that much?

50:48.669 --> 50:50.069
Sure Vic.

50:51.167 --> 50:53.767
This might sound a little hokey, but I
wrote a song....

50:54.503 --> 50:56.503
..and I would like to make a record
of it, just for you.

50:57.709 --> 50:59.709
Oh Vic. That's nice.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.520
Would you mind stepping into the
booth while I record it?

51:03.205 --> 51:04.405
I'd love to.

53:45.042 --> 53:48.442
All right Corwin. What are you doing?
Are you going to make this your life's work?

53:48.771 --> 53:51.571
What do you want from me? Why
don't you worry about what you are
doing and I'll worry about what I'm doing...

53:52.664 --> 53:56.464
I never made this stuff before in my
life. When those guys are ready, I'll
give it my all.

53:57.144 --> 54:00.344
Worry about what your doing, I'll
worry about what I'm doing, I've
never done anything like this before in my life.

54:01.373 --> 54:02.773
Who are you?

54:13.144 --> 54:17.144
Good boy Corwin, good boy. Now
let's got down to the dispensary.t.

54:17.953 --> 54:18.753
The what, the where?

54:19.012 --> 54:22.612
The little old dispensary. We're
going to take the little old arm, and
we're going to roll up the little old sleeve...

54:23.384 --> 54:25.984
then we'll get the little old needle
and give you a little old shot...

54:27.007 --> 54:28.807
and it aint' going to hurt a little old
bit. Come on.

54:28.991 --> 54:31.791
- You sure it ain't going to hurt?
- No it won't hurt you a bit. Come
on.

54:32.949 --> 54:34.149
Good boy, go ahead.

54:36.751 --> 54:40.151
Believe me, you won't even feel the little old
needle.

54:40.831 --> 54:42.031
I won't feel the little old needle?

54:42.556 --> 54:45.156
- Noooo, won't even hurt you a little bit?
- Won't even hurt me a little bit?

54:46.137 --> 54:46.737
Noooo.

54:47.179 --> 54:49.579
- Is it a square needle?
- Round needle.

54:49.582 --> 54:50.582
Next.

55:11.751 --> 55:12.751
Corwin!

55:15.625 --> 55:16.825
Now just relax.

55:20.218 --> 55:21.418
Roll up your sleeve.

55:21.441 --> 55:23.341
Think of something pleasant.

55:24.565 --> 55:26.265
You're eating ice-cream.

55:26.094 --> 55:28.494
You're dancing with a beautiful,
beautiful girl.

55:29.793 --> 55:32.193
You're sleeping in a white dreamy bed.

55:38.802 --> 55:39.802
I didn't bet to the last part.

55:41.268 --> 55:44.068
Now that didn't hurt a bit, did it?
How do you feel?

55:44.858 --> 55:47.658
Feel good? Okay. Come on, let's
go.

55:50.699 --> 55:52.099
Corwin!

55:54.590 --> 55:55.590
Come in.

56:06.601 --> 56:09.001
- Does this finish up your maleria shots?
- Yes Corporal.

56:09.619 --> 56:12.419
- And me too.
- Here take this note into the mess sergeant.

56:14.031 --> 56:14.631
How do you feel?

56:19.352 --> 56:21.352
- You said it wouldn't hurt me.
- You'll live.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.440
That's what I'm afraid of.

56:25.899 --> 56:27.099
- Good-morning Corporal.
- Good-morning Captain.

56:28.531 --> 56:29.731
As you were.

56:32.870 --> 56:36.470
Puccinelli, I talked to Colonel
Davies and he is going to put you
on that overseas movement.

56:37.075 --> 56:38.075
That's swell Captain.

56:38.361 --> 56:40.761
Coporal Clark tell you about the
army woman that was in army room yesterday?

56:42.302 --> 56:42.902
Yes sir.

56:43.012 --> 56:45.612
She's having trouble locating some
man in the company.

56:46.584 --> 56:47.984
And I want you to find the man.

56:48.311 --> 56:50.311
Yes sir. I'll try, but it won't be easy.

56:50.899 --> 56:52.499
She could make things nasty, if she
got to the Colonel.

56:53.629 --> 56:55.829
- Will you take care of it?
- I'll do my best sir.

56:56.165 --> 56:58.965
Good! As soon as you find the
man, I want to see him.

56:59.672 --> 57:00.472
Yes sir.

57:03.183 --> 57:06.183
How do you like that? Now I'm in
charge of domestic relations.

57:06.216 --> 57:09.016
Even that little old alert gag I pulled
on Millie just to kiss her a few times...

57:10.956 --> 57:12.956
Hey douse them lights. The
Colonel is coming by.

57:25.453 --> 57:29.053
Sarg Puccinelli, I'd like to see your
copy of the master training schedule

57:30.728 --> 57:33.528
It's supposed to be posted
on the bulletin board
Yes Sir

57:34.427 --> 57:37.227
Clark, show the Colonel
how we posted the schedule

57:43.385 --> 57:44.985
- It's here sir.
- I can't see it.

57:46.453 --> 57:48.053
It's, it's......I'm sure I put it here

57:48.366 --> 57:49.766
Well it doesn't seem to be here now.

57:50.995 --> 57:52.595
I think it's in the other room Colonel.

57:56.214 --> 57:57.814
- What was that?
- I think it's in the other room.

57:59.172 --> 57:59.972
Colonel.

58:21.746 --> 58:23.346
-Good-morning Colonel.
- Good-morning Caldwell

58:24.112 --> 58:26.112
We can't seem to find a copy of that
master training schedule.

58:26.456 --> 58:28.256
It should be posted in every orderly
room.

58:29.364 --> 58:30.764
It's probably there sir.

58:31.854 --> 58:34.554
- No it isn't on that board.
- I can't understand why it isn't up.

58:41.644 --> 58:42.644
Here it is.

58:47.914 --> 58:49.714
I hope it looks better than your
orderly room.

58:51.482 --> 58:53.082
Sergeant Puccinelli.

58:59.794 --> 59:00.994
Open that door!

59:29.220 --> 59:31.220
I hope someday to see a copy of
that master training schedule.

59:33.120 --> 59:35.120
We found it sir. It was posted under SOP.

59:36.692 --> 59:38.892
Ah yes. Well no wonder I didn't see
it. It's too dark in here.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.379
Turn on those lights.

59:53.225 --> 59:54.225
Here's the envelope from ltalian.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.092
- So you're really going to ship me out?
- That's right.

59:58.739 --> 01:00:02.139
Well "Cutie". I had a nice little talk
last night with Millie and...

01:00:02.848 --> 01:00:03.448
And?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.700
And I'll give you the rest of the day
to get my name off that list.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.846
Don't threaten me. Out!

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:11.865
Wait a minute.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.380
It's a pleasure.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.592
Here's a telegram for Corwin. Give
it to him in the messhall.

01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:18.626
Sergeant Puccinelli.

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.725
Colonel Davies is going to inspect
the supply room.

01:00:21.623 --> 01:00:23.423
-And following that, the messhall.
-Yes sir.

01:00:25.768 --> 01:00:27.168
- Miller!
- Yeah?

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.325
- The Colonel is going to inspect in
a minute. - Oh no Serg!

01:00:31.245 --> 01:00:32.245
Ditch this for me.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.864
Where am I going to hide this? A
long one for Louie.

01:00:37.347 --> 01:00:40.547
It's all right. We're part of the
charges.

01:00:41.998 --> 01:00:43.798
Captain, what's gotten into this
company?

01:00:44.494 --> 01:00:46.894
- Well a few things have gone wrong sir.
-A few things?

01:00:47.559 --> 01:00:48.959
Captain I have never....

01:00:52.695 --> 01:00:55.095
- What was that?
- Sounds like the messhall.

01:00:55.395 --> 01:00:56.195
Messhall?

01:00:58.347 --> 01:01:00.947
- Signal's over.
- What's the meaning of this?

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:05.833
Sergeant Puccinelli, what's going
on here?

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:10.432
What's that whistle? Is there a fire?
What is it?

01:01:11.385 --> 01:01:13.985
It's a baby. Vic look! It's a little
baby!

01:01:14.843 --> 01:01:17.543
Look when we first married, we
didn't think we'd have any, then...

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:21.050
we got a little....COLONEL!

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.720
Colonel said this is the most
outrageous company he's ever seen.

01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:28.991
He's cancelled you off that shipping
order.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.340
- You mean I can't go overseas?
- That's right.

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:33.817
Here it is in writing.

01:01:38.831 --> 01:01:40.631
I'm sorry sir. Yes sir.

01:01:43.711 --> 01:01:44.711
How do you like that?

01:01:45.554 --> 01:01:49.454
7 09. Five years in this man's army.
Five years and the day before I go
on shipping...

01:01:49.724 --> 01:01:51.124
I get caught in this filthy machinary.

01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:55.675
What's the first class this
afternoon? Calisthenics.

01:01:55.858 --> 01:01:58.958
Of fine, that's all I need. There's got
to be an easier way to make a living.

01:02:07.399 --> 01:02:10.199
I'm afraid this little number will keep
us busy for a week.

01:02:10.637 --> 01:02:12.637
- Oh good-afternoon Mrs. Caldwell.
- Good-afternoon.

01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:15.078
How soon will you be ready?

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:17.749
Well, well, well. All dressed up to
go places, I see.

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:21.670
I'm afraid for once in my life, I have
a surprise for you.

01:02:22.755 --> 01:02:23.755
Really?

01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:26.018
It seems without consulting you..

01:02:26.305 --> 01:02:30.305
the Colonel has given B-company
officers a special problem which will
undoubtly take all night to do.

01:02:31.709 --> 01:02:32.309
What kind of problem?

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:37.189
We have to identify a number of
South Pacific islands by their topography.

01:02:39.057 --> 01:02:41.057
- Sally said you wouldn't get that till
tomorrow.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.658
Then you must have done
something to anger Sally, because
she gave it to us today.

01:02:45.737 --> 01:02:46.937
Well I'll tell her a thing or two..

01:02:47.819 --> 01:02:49.219
I might have come out without the
answers.

01:02:51.342 --> 01:02:52.942
The answers?

01:02:53.505 --> 01:02:54.705
I've got them right here,
some place.

01:02:58.093 --> 01:02:59.493
Here you are.

01:03:02.444 --> 01:03:05.444
Munich, Straussberg, these aren't
the answers.

01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:07.158
Oh, that's C-company.

01:03:08.905 --> 01:03:10.105
Here's yours.

01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:15.284
Ero, colsoe, Dagora......

01:03:17.457 --> 01:03:19.057
If I thought there was another
woman like Dorthy on this earth...

01:03:19.945 --> 01:03:22.945
..I'd tell you to get married at once.

01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:24.821
I'm certainly glad you appreciate me.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:30.477
Well, I've got a few things to pick up
at the PX. And I'll be back to pick
you up in exactly 20 minutes.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:38.045
I'd better give this to Captain
Conner in C-company.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.083
At ease men.

01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:49.369
- That Mc Vie. He wants another
good-conduct ribbon.
- How does he lose so many?

01:03:48.633 --> 01:03:51.433
I don't know . He gets plastered and
deal them out like fraternity pins.

01:03:52.983 --> 01:03:55.383
Hey, the Colonel is checking
calisthenics.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:03.805
- I beg your pardon sir.
- Yes, what is it?

01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:05.987
Colonel is checking orderly rooms...

01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:22.872
- Sergeant Miller on duty sir.
- Where is Segeant Puccinelli?

01:04:23.331 --> 01:04:25.931
With the company, taking calisthenics
sir. Shall I get him for you sir?

01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:27.721
No.

01:04:28.387 --> 01:04:30.187
No, the exercise will be good for him.

01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:30.981
Yes sir.

01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:32.383
- Miller. ..
- Yes sir?

01:04:32.929 --> 01:04:36.729
At ease. What's the name of that
Sergeant, the one with the whistle?

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:38.639
Oh you mean Mc Vie sir.

01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:45.258
I want you to find Mc Vie immediately.
Tell him to get this entire outfit on the
obstacle course in 10 minutes. Understand?

01:04:46.526 --> 01:04:47.526
Yes sir!

01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:09.786
Hey Corwin.

01:05:22.345 --> 01:05:24.345
Come on let's go. Head's down.

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:28.721
Come on you guys, keep it moving.
I want to hear them helmets. Keep moving.

01:05:48.099 --> 01:05:51.899
All right, come on. Come out fresh,
keep moving.

01:05:56.277 --> 01:06:00.077
Hey Corwin, come out. You're beginning
to fall back. Let's get out of there.

01:06:05.519 --> 01:06:06.919
All right come on, keep crawling.

01:06:08.528 --> 01:06:11.128
All right let's go. Stay with it.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:15.068
Come on let's go. You're holding it
up there.

01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:22.936
Come on Corwin, let's go. You're holding
up the detail. All the guys are waiting.

01:06:24.392 --> 01:06:25.792
On this side Corwin, are you crazy?

01:06:26.824 --> 01:06:28.424
On this side! Stay here now!

01:06:30.207 --> 01:06:31.407
Come on, you can do it.

01:06:37.617 --> 01:06:39.017
Taken like a bird.

01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:51.284
Corwin!

01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:54.351
- Yes Serg?
- You've got to stop this clowning.

01:07:04.886 --> 01:07:06.486
All right you guys, keep it low.

01:07:18.497 --> 01:07:19.497
Corwin!

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:21.827
What happened to Corwin?

01:07:25.948 --> 01:07:27.148
Corwin!

01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:44.268
Okay, let's go. You're holding it up.
Look alive there.

01:07:48.042 --> 01:07:50.442
All right you guys. Come on now,
come on.

01:08:02.372 --> 01:08:06.372
Keep moving. What are you doing
up there? Mailing letters?

01:08:10.254 --> 01:08:12.054
Corwin...

01:08:13.944 --> 01:08:15.944
Hey Corwin you all right?

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:18.868
Water! Get some water! Hurry up!

01:08:19.607 --> 01:08:20.807
Here you are Serg. What do I do
with it?

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:22.370
Let him have it.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:33.430
Wait a second. Now take it easy.

01:08:34.886 --> 01:08:36.286
Come on. You all right Corwin?

01:10:31.983 --> 01:10:34.583
Well I'm glad to see that they finally
fixed that soft drink machine.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.331
Well, I think I'll go in there and take
care of that supply sergeant now.

01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:44.123
You know, he turns the same
articles in for salvage over and over again.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:48.010
You'd think he was going to open up
and army and navy store.

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:53.790
As you were.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.350
-Sergeant Miller?
- Yes Sergeant?

01:10:59.084 --> 01:11:01.084
- Hey where's Sergeant Puccinelli?
- I don't know.

01:11:02.308 --> 01:11:03.308
Boy he's sure in trouble again.

01:11:04.114 --> 01:11:06.714
The Colonel's after him, the
Captain's after him and Millie's after him.

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:09.625
I wouldn't trade places with him with
14 points.

01:11:21.256 --> 01:11:24.256
I see that you took care of that
supply situation to your satisfation.

01:11:26.445 --> 01:11:27.245
Yes sir!

01:11:28.077 --> 01:11:30.077
I don't think we'll have anymore
trouble with Sergeant Miller.

01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:52.303
Boy that was close! The Colonel
almost had me that time.

01:11:53.078 --> 01:11:55.678
- Got a cigarette.
- Yeah, sure Serg. Here, roll your own.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.479
That'll be all Sergeant Miller.

01:12:02.497 --> 01:12:04.097
What's Miller featuring today?

01:12:18.006 --> 01:12:19.206
- 40. medium?
- Yep.

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:31.045
Yes sir?

01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:33.637
Have you made any progress
finding out about that girl?

01:12:35.869 --> 01:12:38.669
- What girl? - The one who was
in the orderly room yesterday.

01:12:39.148 --> 01:12:40.948
Oh yes sir. I have a hunch sir.

01:12:42.219 --> 01:12:43.619
I want to see that man as soon as
possible.

01:12:44.467 --> 01:12:45.467
Yes sir.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:54.590
- Hey where's Corwin?
- He's in the rec hall rehearsing.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120
Rehearsing for what? How to
become a mental case?

01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:23.156
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- Where?

01:14:23.374 --> 01:14:25.774
- To see Captain Caldwell.
- What'd I do now?

01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:29.298
- You'll find out and I'm delivering
you C.O.D. - What about the number?

01:14:30.203 --> 01:14:32.003
- What number?
- You promised Pokey you'd do it.

01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:34.111
Well tell him to get with it, but hurry up.

01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:37.101
All right, go ahead, ask him.

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.239
But watch how you ask him. In a
nice way. Use a little diplomacy.

01:14:40.547 --> 01:14:43.147
You say: Pokey, will you play a
song for Vic and I, we're going to dance.

01:14:43.814 --> 01:14:48.214
Cause you and me Alvin. We're
going to be together a long, long
time. You and me, we're friends right?

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:52.290
So go ahead and ask Pokey. So go
ahead and ask him and I'll wait too.
Go ahead.

01:14:53.238 --> 01:14:56.638
You say: Pokey, play some music
for Vic and I. Go ahead. What are
you waiting for?

01:14:57.099 --> 01:14:58.099
Okay!!

01:14:59.483 --> 01:15:00.883
I forgot what I was going to ask him now.

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:06.310
Oh yeah! Pokey, will you play this dance
song so that Vic and I can do this together?

01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:08.276
- Sure.
- Thanks a heap.

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:12.990
-Old song and dance?
-Old song and dance?

01:16:13.475 --> 01:16:15.075
No, the whole band, they should
play it together.

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.143
What are you waiting for?

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:24.170
Look buster, I don't do it unless the
Sergeant tells me.

01:16:26.653 --> 01:16:27.453
Okay folks.

01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:52.611
All right folks, let's quiet down now .

01:16:53.504 --> 01:16:57.504
We'd like to present First Sergeant
Victor Puccinelli and Private First
Class, Alvin Corwin.

01:16:58.316 --> 01:17:00.516
Doing their impression of two great
personalities.

01:17:15.659 --> 01:17:17.859
Well, top of the morning to you
friend.

01:17:19.827 --> 01:17:21.427
How are you me boy?

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:25.944
I just thought I'd stop over now son,
and let you know that....

01:17:28.825 --> 01:17:32.025
I don't knock the idea of you leaving
in St. Dominique's charge.

01:17:31.728 --> 01:17:34.128
Well I kind of hate to see you leave
the place too padre.

01:17:35.799 --> 01:17:40.199
- I was just wondering if I might ask
a wee bit of a favor son.
-Well, go right ahead.

01:17:42.359 --> 01:17:46.159
I would love you to sing one of me
old Irish lullabyes. Just once now,
before you go.

01:17:47.478 --> 01:17:50.278
Now which little lrish lullabye you
thinking about?

01:17:51.306 --> 01:17:55.306
The one you did that night I was so
sick in bed son. You remember that
one, now don't you lad?

01:17:55.907 --> 01:17:59.907
Well, couldn't rightly do it for you
tonight Padre, for I got to have
music behind me, you know that.

01:18:01.085 --> 01:18:04.885
But I've got a musicbox with me.
Won't you try now son?

01:18:05.869 --> 01:18:09.669
- It should be a pleasure to do it for you.
- Just open it wide open.

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:27.626
Sir, would you still like to see the
man I spoke to you about? The one
that caused all the trouble.

01:19:27.759 --> 01:19:28.959
- Most definetly!
- Yes sir.

01:19:30.059 --> 01:19:30.659
Corwin...

01:19:31.509 --> 01:19:32.509
Come here.

01:19:42.436 --> 01:19:45.236
Private First Class Corwin reporting
sir, as ordered.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:45.981
At ease.

01:19:47.086 --> 01:19:48.086
Corwin...

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:49.490
What's your first name?

01:19:49.691 --> 01:19:50.891
- Alvin.
- Alvin?

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:52.054
Yes sir.

01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:56.670
Alvin, bringing children into the
world is a solemn matter.

01:19:58.138 --> 01:20:00.738
Solemn sir? I didn't think it was so
solemn.

01:20:01.328 --> 01:20:02.128
That's the trouble.

01:20:02.921 --> 01:20:04.721
Sometimes we don't realize it until
it's too late.

01:20:06.214 --> 01:20:08.414
Now, what do you intend to do
about this matter?

01:20:09.145 --> 01:20:10.345
Nothing sir. Everything been done
already.

01:20:10.851 --> 01:20:12.251
That's the wrong attitude entirely.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:16.670
-Aren't you ashamed?
- No sir. I'm very proud.

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060
Proud?

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.881
Yes sir. We wanted a baby, so we
got a baby.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.625
- You wanted a baby?
- Yes sir.

01:20:23.842 --> 01:20:27.242
But don't you understand? You
can't let this baby grow up without a name.

01:20:27.965 --> 01:20:29.365
I know. We'll think of a name for it.

01:20:29.756 --> 01:20:30.756
That's not what I mean.

01:20:31.987 --> 01:20:34.787
Now Corwin, listen to me closely.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.139
Do you have any love for this
woman?

01:20:38.215 --> 01:20:41.415
- Yes sir. I love her very much.
- Then my job should be simple.

01:20:42.711 --> 01:20:46.511
I'm going to give you a three-day
pass, so that you can go to this girl
and do right by her.

01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:47.651
Oh thank-you sir.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.890
But understand, this pass is only to
give this baby a name.

01:20:52.526 --> 01:20:53.726
Three-day pass to think of a
name...

01:20:54.966 --> 01:20:55.966
I know sir, we'll name it after you.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:57.403
That's not necessary.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.100
But I'll tell you this: when the baby
is born, I'll see to it that you get an
emergency furlow.

01:21:03.399 --> 01:21:05.999
But sir I..... No buts about it!

01:21:05.564 --> 01:21:10.164
Get into class A uniform.
- Yes sir.

01:21:16.363 --> 01:21:19.163
Puccinelli. I've decided to give
Corwin a three-day pass.

01:21:19.095 --> 01:21:20.895
Pass? But Captain, after what he
did?

01:21:21.681 --> 01:21:24.081
Well I have to give him a pass, so
he can get married.

01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:26.770
Get married? What for?

01:21:27.433 --> 01:21:31.033
Puccinelli. Is this or is this not the
man who is in trouble?

01:21:31.452 --> 01:21:35.652
Sir, yes sir! He's in trouble all right.
What he means is, the baby's
already been born.

01:21:37.319 --> 01:21:38.919
- Is that right Corwin?
- Ah, yes sir.

01:21:39.226 --> 01:21:40.226
Yes mam', yes sergeant.

01:21:41.368 --> 01:21:42.568
Oh, that's different. Give me that pass.

01:21:44.115 --> 01:21:47.315
- Oh but Captain!
- We'll give you an emergency furlow.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:49.470
Oh thank-you.

01:21:49.683 --> 01:21:51.883
Get this Corwin, you'd better bring
back a marriage certificate.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:53.908
Oh that's easy. I got one in the
barracks.

01:21:54.816 --> 01:21:58.016
He doesn't mean his own sir. One of
the boys has one tacked up on the wall.

01:21:59.601 --> 01:22:01.001
Corwin, you'd better get ready to go.

01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:03.331
Yes Sergeant.

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:14.142
- Well I'm off to battalion.
- Sir, do you want me to type up
these furlow papers?

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.833
No, I'll have it done at
headquarters. I want to push it right through.

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.580
Clark, don't leave me here alone.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.755
- Cutie!
- Millie, what a surprise to see you here.

01:22:26.824 --> 01:22:29.024
Well, I've been trying so hard to see you.

01:22:29.955 --> 01:22:30.755
Millie, come here.

01:22:32.766 --> 01:22:35.166
- Now tell me the truth.
- Are you going to have.... Yes Vic.

01:22:36.362 --> 01:22:37.162
Where did you hear?

01:22:37.528 --> 01:22:39.328
Where did I hear? Well it's
practilly a coast to coast hook-up.

01:22:41.693 --> 01:22:43.493
Look honey. Step into the Captain's
office, just for a minute.

01:22:44.008 --> 01:22:45.808
NO! There's too much traffic in there.

01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:47.039
Please Millie.

01:22:48.405 --> 01:22:49.205
Come in.

01:22:52.488 --> 01:22:56.088
Victor Puccinelli. I have a few
questions to ask you.

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:56.759
Helen, listen.

01:22:57.143 --> 01:22:59.343
And the first one has to do with
Jack Edwards.

01:22:59.745 --> 01:23:00.945
Oh if that's all that's bothering you.

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.237
- Listen Cutie.
- Please Millie.

01:23:05.203 --> 01:23:06.003
Who was that girl?

01:23:06.978 --> 01:23:08.178
Mrs. Caldwell, the Captain's wife.

01:23:09.391 --> 01:23:12.591
If you send Jack Edwards out of
this camp, you can consider our
relationship at an end.

01:23:13.772 --> 01:23:14.572
Oh you wouldn't do that, would you
honey?

01:23:15.736 --> 01:23:20.536
On the contrary. I'm not sure I'm in
love with either one of you. Well, I
want to be fair to you both.

01:23:21.499 --> 01:23:23.099
- Now look...
- Good-afternoon Sergeant.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:26.107
Captain Caldwell, Miss Palmer, I'd
like to have you meet her.

01:23:27.021 --> 01:23:28.021
-How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:32.010
Captain, I think you are wanted
down at battalion headquarters.

01:23:35.946 --> 01:23:36.946
Can I help you?

01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:39.050
Lt. Davenport!

01:23:40.279 --> 01:23:42.079
Now wait a minute. Don't mix me
up in this.

01:23:44.279 --> 01:23:46.279
- Maybe I'd better leave.
- No! One moment.

01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:48.541
You've made a startling recovery,
haven't you?

01:23:49.878 --> 01:23:51.278
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.930
-Sergeant Puccinelli.
- Yes sir.

01:23:55.222 --> 01:23:57.022
There he is. Corwin, come in here.

01:23:57.286 --> 01:23:57.886
Sit down young lady.

01:23:59.241 --> 01:24:01.641
- Can you explain....
-First Class Corwin reporting as
ordered sir.

01:24:02.361 --> 01:24:06.161
Can you kindly explain why this
young lady is sitting here
completely recovered...

01:24:07.235 --> 01:24:08.035
...and you're about

01:24:09.719 --> 01:24:11.519
and you're about to start an
emergency furlow?

01:24:11.979 --> 01:24:13.379
Recovered sir? What was wrong
with her?

01:24:13.825 --> 01:24:15.225
Don't try to be funny.

01:24:15.772 --> 01:24:17.972
I don't understand Captain. I never
saw that woman before last night.

01:24:18.897 --> 01:24:20.097
You never saw her before last night?

01:24:21.073 --> 01:24:22.473
- No!
- Then why do you think you're
getting this furlow?

01:24:22.946 --> 01:24:24.746
Cause my wife had a baby.

01:24:25.604 --> 01:24:27.404
Your wife had a baby.

01:24:27.948 --> 01:24:29.948
Yes sir. Here's a telegram I got.

01:24:34.119 --> 01:24:35.319
Well, I think I get this now.

01:24:36.766 --> 01:24:39.366
-Do you know him?
- No, but he's cute.

01:24:41.365 --> 01:24:43.965
- Here's your furlow.
- Take it and get out. Thank-you
Captain. Yes sir.

01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:48.530
- And give my love to the baby.
- Yes sir, I will sir. Thank-you
Captain. Good-bye.

01:24:55.879 --> 01:24:56.879
Now young lady....

01:24:58.249 --> 01:24:59.849
Where is everybody? Sergeant
Puccinelli.

01:25:00.564 --> 01:25:00.764
Yes sir.

01:25:01.592 --> 01:25:03.792
Do you realize that this whole mess
is still up in the air? Corwin wasn't the man.

01:25:04.325 --> 01:25:04.925
He wasn't sir?

01:25:05.692 --> 01:25:07.292
I can't understand your attitude lately.

01:25:08.141 --> 01:25:09.341
I guess I'll have to take care of this
myself.

01:25:09.949 --> 01:25:12.149
Give me the company roster with
the physical descriptions of the men.

01:25:12.446 --> 01:25:12.846
Yes sir.

01:25:36.406 --> 01:25:41.406
Well, I suppose we should introduce
ourselves. I'm Helen Palmer and
this is ah....

01:25:43.358 --> 01:25:44.958
Captain Caldwell's wife.

01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:48.164
And, who are you?

01:25:49.473 --> 01:25:51.073
I'm not quite sure.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.680
The Captain would like to see you.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.520
Me? Oh, but I was just in there.

01:26:00.606 --> 01:26:03.406
Ernie Caldwell! What's the
meaning of this?

01:26:03.654 --> 01:26:04.654
She was introduced to me as your wife.

01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:06.530
Now wait a minute.

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:08.944
What do you mean when you said
you had just been in here?

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:12.825
I was just in here. I was here last
night too.

01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:17.171
The desk was here, there was a
chair there and over there.....

01:26:17.609 --> 01:26:19.809
Now darling, this is an army matter.
This is not your affair.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:22.802
Now young lady, what's the
meaning of this.

01:26:22.982 --> 01:26:24.382
- Captain, I can.....
- Sergeant Puccinelli.

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.946
-Ernie Caldwell! Can't you stay
outside until this is settled?

01:26:28.164 --> 01:26:29.564
If there's anything going on, I want
to know about it.

01:26:30.167 --> 01:26:32.567
Then let's both get outside and I'll
try to explain.

01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:35.228
- I don't understand...
- But Captain.

01:26:35.956 --> 01:26:37.156
Oh come on Millie, let's get out of here.

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:39.559
But I still don't understand.

01:26:40.533 --> 01:26:42.333
Why is everybody picking on me?

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:45.990
Hi ya Cutie! Well honey, what are
you doing here?

01:26:46.831 --> 01:26:49.831
I was worried. I came over here to
ask Vic about you going on that shipment.

01:26:50.478 --> 01:26:52.478
Oh don't worry. Cutie will see that I
don't go.

01:26:53.613 --> 01:26:55.213
Come on, why don't you give up?`
You can't win.

01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:57.362
Puccinelli, we have something that
must be settled.

01:26:57.688 --> 01:27:00.888
Now just a minute. For 5 years this
army has been deciding things for
me to do...

01:27:01.775 --> 01:27:04.775
But I'm in the driver's seat this time.
I don't want to be a warrant-officer.
I want to go overseas.

01:27:05.786 --> 01:27:07.186
I want to get away from everything.
Away from all this.

01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:12.469
That sir is something else I'm
deciding. I'm busting myself.

01:27:13.218 --> 01:27:15.418
- You can't do that.
- I can't, but you can do it for me.
Watch.

01:27:17.702 --> 01:27:19.502
- Oh honey.
- Ernie!

01:27:20.036 --> 01:27:21.436
- What did you call him?
- Ernie.

01:27:21.567 --> 01:27:23.267
- Did he say he was Ernie
Caldwell?
- Yes.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:24.908
- Then there is something.....
- Ladies, please!

01:27:25.705 --> 01:27:27.305
Now if you'll just wait dear.

01:27:30.427 --> 01:27:31.827
Is he the man you have been going
steady with?

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.380
- No, I only met him last night.
- Last night?

01:27:35.204 --> 01:27:37.204
Oh I think this whole thing is silly.
Let's get out of here.

01:27:38.919 --> 01:27:41.319
Now then Miss. You must have
gone out with another in this company?

01:27:41.974 --> 01:27:42.574
Present sir!

01:27:43.111 --> 01:27:46.711
So it's you Puccinelli. Well, I'm going
to give you exactly what you asked for.

01:27:47.984 --> 01:27:49.184
You'll be reduced to private and
shipped overseas.

01:27:49.883 --> 01:27:50.483
Thank-you sir.

01:27:50.959 --> 01:27:54.359
And don't think this relieves you of
your responsibilities to this woman
you are married to.

01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:56.790
- Married to me?
- Now don't deny it.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.840
Oh but he isn't. I'm already
married, to someone else.

01:28:01.628 --> 01:28:05.828
John Slaker. Has been since a
week after I broke up with Vic.

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:07.862
Well what have you been looking
for me for?

01:28:08.429 --> 01:28:11.304
Because I want to tell you not
to come and

01:28:11.707 --> 01:28:14.507
see me tonight, like you
promised 4 months ago.

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:18.022
Before John and I were married.
You won't come, will you?

01:28:18.755 --> 01:28:19.755
Holy Toledo, no!

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:24.596
I'm so glad. My husband might not
understand.....

01:28:25.766 --> 01:28:29.566
....he's not very bright and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

01:28:30.323 --> 01:28:34.123
Oh well, good-bye and thanks so much.

01:28:35.678 --> 01:28:37.678
- Don't think that this will clear you.
-We're still busting you.

01:28:38.619 --> 01:28:40.819
Okay, so I'm busted. For once I've
beaten the army.

01:28:41.462 --> 01:28:43.262
While all these other guys are
rotting here in the states....

01:28:43.488 --> 01:28:45.488
.,...I'll be on the other side and the army
had nothing to do with it. I did it all myself.

01:28:48.272 --> 01:28:49.872
- What the devil is that?
- I don't know sir.

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:51.333
It sounds like a special call.

01:28:52.043 --> 01:28:55.643
Captain Caldwell. Have you heard
the news. All movements, transfers
and furlows have been cancelled.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:56.763
- Movements cancelled.
- Sure.

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.331
Sure, the whole outfit is going
overseas.

01:28:59.155 --> 01:29:01.555
- But darling, why didn't you?
- Sally never told me.

01:29:02.736 --> 01:29:05.536
Ernie Caldwell. Step into my office.

01:29:06.256 --> 01:29:08.056
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

01:29:10.606 --> 01:29:11.406
Let go of me.

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:14.210
Serg, I just caught this man trying to
sneak off the boat.

01:29:14.844 --> 01:29:16.044
Don't bother me, I'm out of business.

01:29:16.869 --> 01:29:19.069
Sneak off the boat nothing. I've got
a furlow. I've got to see my baby.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.613
-You ain't got no furlow.
- I have!

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.520
- No you don't.
- I have!

01:29:24.215 --> 01:29:25.015
QUIET!

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.010
- All furlows is cancelled.
-Cancelled!?

01:29:27.127 --> 01:29:30.927
Right, the whole division is going
overseas.
- OVERSEAS!?

01:29:33.151 --> 01:29:35.951
Wait a minute, you too.

01:29:37.273 --> 01:29:42.273
That's right. Come on Private
Puccinelli. Join your buddy. Let's
be getting on the ball.

01:29:46.726 --> 01:29:48.726
- Pick it up.
- Pick what up?

01:29:48.903 --> 01:29:49.903
The suitcase.

01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:52.366
Private Puccinelli.

01:30:00.092 --> 01:30:01.092
Vic.

01:30:04.207 --> 01:30:05.407
I'll take it.

01:30:05.828 --> 01:30:07.428
- What?
- The bag.

01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:10.927
Nah, come on. I'll take it.
