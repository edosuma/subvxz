WEBVTT

00:24.792 --> 00:28.627
Samuel: <i>Robert, please
don't</i> waste the ice.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.402
Keep it there.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.203
( groans )

00:41.575 --> 00:44.143
You didn't provoke them?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.411
Provoke them?

00:45.413 --> 00:47.379
( chuckles )

00:47.381 --> 00:49.048
I was readying for bed.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.685
<i>( distant horse whinnies )</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:02.728
<i>They rode in out of the night.</i>

01:04.364 --> 01:06.665
Identified themselves
as Queen's Rangers.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.536
And then immediately set to wreaking
as much havoc as they could.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.273
( whinnies )

01:14.275 --> 01:16.809
<i>They slaughtered the animals,</i>

01:16.811 --> 01:19.211
<i>- burned the barn.
- ( horse screaming )</i>

01:19.213 --> 01:21.547
- <i>As for me...</i>
- ( grunts )

01:24.785 --> 01:28.187
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

01:28.189 --> 01:31.256
I suppose things could have been
worse than a few bruised ribs.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.627
And broken pride.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.664
The Queen's Rangers
are not known

01:38.666 --> 01:40.499
for their delicate
touch, Father.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.335
You stood your ground.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.672
But if there is a next time...

01:54.148 --> 01:55.247
What is that?

01:55.249 --> 01:57.249
I would have
thought that obvious.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.718
I bought it on York Island.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.589
The spirit of Christ
will never move us to war

02:03.591 --> 02:06.725
against any man
with outward weapons.

02:06.727 --> 02:11.330
- They attacked you.
- And we cannot let them taint us.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.432
The Society of Friends
do not harbor arms.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.400
Now take that away.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.374
You are right, Father.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.312
I will not need outward weapons.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.782
What was it that Woodhull said?

02:30.784 --> 02:34.620
I need only my eyes,

02:34.622 --> 02:37.356
my ears, my wits.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.825
So you've chosen a side?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.693
No, no, they chose for me

02:41.695 --> 02:43.929
when they came into this
house and dealt violence.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.634
<i>They will pay, Father.</i>

02:49.770 --> 02:53.672
God as my witness,
they will pay.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.342
I said not to hurt the old man.

04:00.841 --> 04:04.509
The whole regiment is searching,
Captain, but we're spread thin.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.712
Are we sure Rogers
is moving west?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.948
After he robbed me,
he ran off west.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.550
He can't have gotten far.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.852
He was wounded
and blind in one eye.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.954
I know, I blinded him.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.259
Falkoff, push towards the coastline,
then cut up to your perimeter.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.428
Rogers dies today.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.932
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

04:29.703 --> 04:32.604
<i>( twigs snap )</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:35.007
<i>( footsteps )</i>

04:41.515 --> 04:44.449
Set their hounds to me,
did you, farmer?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.500
<i>( footsteps )</i>

05:16.917 --> 05:18.583
( grunts )

05:18.585 --> 05:20.786
- ( muffled shouting )
- Shh!

05:20.788 --> 05:23.689
Take a circle till you
come to your own tracks.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.858
You forgot my rules, Eldridge.

05:28.062 --> 05:31.797
- ( chatter )
- <i>( hammering )</i>

05:35.035 --> 05:37.536
There must be some way.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.805
I bet Martha could spot
the telltale.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.740
André's forger was very good.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.643
The paper is ours. The printing
is an exact duplicate.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.645
And there were 12 crews
to disperse it.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.481
Well, 11 after we stopped
Lieutenant Gamble at Moodna Creek.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.584
Yes, and André managed to slip a
considerable sum past our lines,

05:52.586 --> 05:56.588
which is why we must
now travel to Philadelphia.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.725
To... to Philadelphia?

05:59.727 --> 06:02.861
And you're going with me.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.064
Since there's no telling how many
counterfeit bills are already in use,

06:06.066 --> 06:09.968
<i>His Excellency's only remedy is to
convince Congress to recall all bills.</i>

06:09.970 --> 06:13.004
And he needs you
to testify the same.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.041
Sir, you want Congress
to declare bankruptcy?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.909
To save itself, yes.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.144
I suppose it can't be helped.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.766
But it could have been avoided.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.818
Culper Jr. obtained his intelligence
nearly a week before we could act upon it.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.921
- But, sir, the route is secure.
- It's circuitous.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.990
It's as fast as we can make it.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.860
Culper Jr. passes his gains along
to his father in Oyster Bay.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.662
And that same day,
Culper Sr. picks it up

06:37.664 --> 06:40.065
- and prepares it for the dead drop in
Setauket. -<i> And already it's too late.</i>

06:40.067 --> 06:43.969
Why not send Lieutenant
Brewster direct to Oyster Bay,

06:43.971 --> 06:47.672
<i>eliminate the Setauket run, and
reduce the transfer time by half?</i>

06:47.674 --> 06:49.541
But that would cut
Culper out of the chain.

06:49.543 --> 06:53.111
And reduce the transfer
time by half.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.848
Many mickles make a muckle.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.686
The little things add up.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.896
He's been dead for hours.

07:10.898 --> 07:14.666
<i>Who knows where
Rogers is by now?</i>

07:14.668 --> 07:16.134
Does appear that he is
heading west, though.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.903
So shall we.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.105
Rogers isn't the only
man who can hunt.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.107
He'll stay off the main road,

07:22.109 --> 07:25.043
likely use the coastline
as a guide.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.146
But he won't survive
without provisions and rest.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.817
We'll scour this island,
clear every mud hut standing

07:31.819 --> 07:34.753
till we find
our notorious Mr. Culper.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.725
Woodhull, you may return home.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.495
( clicks tongue )

07:43.497 --> 07:46.465
( horses neigh )

07:54.741 --> 07:55.807
Hyah!

07:58.612 --> 08:00.395
Ben:
<i>We have a problem.</i>

08:00.396 --> 08:02.179
The commander thinks that
the ring is moving too slowly

08:02.182 --> 08:04.182
and, frankly, he's right.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.785
Washington wants Culper out.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.723
I need you to make contact
with Samuel Townsend.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.559
Let him know that from now on, he'll
be dealing directly with you.

08:14.561 --> 08:18.530
Right, that's going
to be a problem.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.899
I know. It's not
personal against Culper.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.502
- It's a strategic decision.
- Yeah, I know. I can't do it.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.570
Caleb, I need to leave
for Philadelphia.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.540
- <i>Ben, I can't</i> go to Oyster Bay.
- I can't debate with you.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.977
Samuel Townsend
cannot see my face.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.044
What?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.549
Come on, the two of you.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.619
Oh, this can't be good.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.857
Right, so a couple
of months back

08:45.859 --> 08:48.793
when I went to New York
to get Abe out of prison...

08:52.232 --> 08:54.933
that stubborn little bastard
refused to go, right?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.635
- <i>Said he still</i> had his cover.
- No, wait!

08:56.637 --> 08:58.537
Said he recruited
a man in New York.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.540
- Look, there is still a chance.
- Townsend?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.608
Right.
Except he hadn't.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.011
You see, Culper Jr.
was still on the fence.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.981
So I met him
at his old boardinghouse.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.652
<i>I gave him the ink,
I showed him how to use it.</i>

09:13.654 --> 09:14.953
<i>But he didn't trust me</i>

09:14.955 --> 09:17.856
<i>and he sure as shite
didn't trust Abe.</i>

09:17.858 --> 09:20.625
Then why would he risk his life
to warn us of the Hickey plot?

09:20.627 --> 09:23.161
Because after I left,
we gave him a push.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.932
Abe knew the Quaker
needed convincing, right?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.701
So he had me scoop up
some Connecticut lads,

09:29.703 --> 09:33.204
row out to Oyster Bay, play
like we were Queen's Rangers,

09:33.206 --> 09:36.207
and ransack the old man's place.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.109
Only it got out of hand.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.179
( groaning )

09:41.181 --> 09:43.815
It was Woody's idea.
It wasn't mine.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.117
- But it worked, right?
- Oh, my God.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.986
<i>The shopkeep joined
the ring, didn't he?</i>

09:47.988 --> 09:51.156
And if he finds out
the truth, he'll quit.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.959
Yeah.
Well... yeah.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.860
And this was Abe's idea?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.796
To do that to Townsend?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.164
Yeah, he's definitely out.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.199
Come on.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.668
It ain't as bad
as what we did to him.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.770
Hmm? Throwing him
into a cell.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.672
- Putting the fear into him.
- Oh, God.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.240
Yeah, it's probably
where he got the idea.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.209
- Ben.
- I can't go to Washington with this.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.189
- I agree.
- Ben.

10:13.190 --> 10:15.168
- Oh, you agree, do you? That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

10:15.169 --> 10:17.147
- So what do you think we should do?
- Ben, send me.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.150
- What?
- He hasn't seen my face.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.653
- Send me.
- ( sighs )

10:21.655 --> 10:23.288
And if you have
reservations about that,

10:23.290 --> 10:25.991
comfort yourself with the fact that
this man has left you no choice.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.726
Hey, that's...

10:30.697 --> 10:32.897
( clears throat )

10:35.936 --> 10:38.837
<i>- ( distant chatter )
- ( birds chirping )</i>

10:42.743 --> 10:44.809
"Nor can we find
the necessity"...

10:44.811 --> 10:47.078
What was that
last part, my love?

10:47.080 --> 10:50.982
André writes, "We are thankful

10:50.984 --> 10:52.851
for the information transmitted

10:52.853 --> 10:56.021
and hope that you will
continue," but to allow him

10:56.023 --> 10:59.124
"to prescribe a little
more exertion."

10:59.126 --> 11:01.259
He wants details
about Washington's camp.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.062
He wants a map of the
batteries at West Point.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.966
Does Washington not ride
for Philadelphia as we speak?

11:07.968 --> 11:10.869
- Perhaps you can...
- These will not be the terms of my defection.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.704
I am a general.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.172
He wants what?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.741
Bountiful monetary compensation

11:16.743 --> 11:19.344
and property indemnified
from any loss

11:19.346 --> 11:21.046
should he be discovered.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.313
Ridiculous.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.215
We have to give
this man something

11:24.217 --> 11:25.850
if only to show good faith.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.119
You have to see things
from his side.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.989
His side? And what is his risk?
Nothing.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.757
If I am to stay this course,

11:32.759 --> 11:34.793
then I need to know
that my demands will be met.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.998
He wants a battlefield command.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.067
Concern yourself
with what I want, John...

11:42.069 --> 11:43.868
details on Washington's camps,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.337
status of all rebel ships
on the Hudson, confirmation...

11:46.339 --> 11:48.973
Regarding the identity
of the spy named Culper.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.943
I don't know any Culper. Intelligence
is Tallmadge's business.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.946
Well, you know him. It wouldn't
be too hard to inquire.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.116
And why should I exert myself for André
when he has done nothing for me?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.351
Because if you don't,
this won't move any further.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.754
Too thick a stone wall
and Arnold won't...

12:02.756 --> 12:05.790
Why should I guarantee him a command
before he's done anything to earn it?

12:05.792 --> 12:08.093
Because you opened this line
of communication.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.261
- Major André...
- I don't trust him.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.031
I don't care how many times he
ate at your father's table.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.101
Or how well acquainted
you are with her sheets.

12:16.103 --> 12:20.171
Arnold will give us what we want or
he will remain with these rebels.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.208
And when they are defeated, he will
be branded alongside Washington

12:23.210 --> 12:25.310
as one of history's
greatest traitors.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.391
"Sums must be held

12:40.393 --> 12:44.496
until a generous effort
has been made."

12:44.498 --> 12:46.765
A generous effort?

12:46.767 --> 12:47.966
<i>( papers rip )</i>

12:47.968 --> 12:51.469
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, Peggy.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.772
I don't know anymore.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.207
Yes, you do.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.813
Benedict, you appealed
to Washington

13:01.815 --> 13:03.815
and he betrayed you.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.884
No.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.187
He suggested that I apply for a
court-martial to clear my name.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.156
It was Joseph Reed
who manipulated

13:11.158 --> 13:13.391
the postponement
of the trial and I let...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.460
I let my anger
cloud my judgment.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.295
No, my love.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.998
Your anger is justified.
You are in the right.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.267
Yes.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.203
Yes, and when I prove that

13:25.205 --> 13:28.039
and when I clear my name
once and for all,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.941
I won't even need the British.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.344
As you said,
Washington is coming.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.015
That's the key. He has the power
to overrule this postponement.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.118
But he is riding here to meet with
Reed and the rest of Congress.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.334
Yes, and before he
does so, he will be

13:42.360 --> 13:44.889
obliged to attend a party
in his honor here.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.424
And that is when
I will convince him,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.092
man-to-man.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.462
<i>( door opens )</i>

13:51.464 --> 13:53.031
( chatter )

13:53.033 --> 13:54.199
Robert:
<i>Already taken stock,</i>

13:54.201 --> 13:56.901
so just mind things
while I'm away.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.303
If they want to buy something,

13:58.305 --> 14:00.305
check the price
and take their money.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.140
I won't be gone long.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.542
Just headed home
for the Thanksgiving Day.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.215
<i>- ( crickets chirping )
- ( bird warbling )</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:26.898
Abraham.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.000
Oh, how wonderful!

14:29.002 --> 14:32.503
How wonderful you've decided to
accept my invitation after all.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.473
- Did you bring the family?
- <i>No, it's just me,</i> I'm afraid.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.976
Oh, I made extra just in case.
All right, well...

14:37.978 --> 14:39.277
<i>- ( door closes )
- Come in. ( chuckles )</i>

14:39.279 --> 14:41.246
( sighs )

14:42.916 --> 14:44.949
- You're gonna have to leave.
- Leave?

14:44.951 --> 14:46.384
Yeah, the Queen's Rangers

14:46.386 --> 14:47.986
are moving down
Long Island again.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.187
<i>They're raiding homes
along the way.</i>

14:49.189 --> 14:51.422
We're gonna have
to go right now.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.925
Samuel: <i>Are we not being</i>
a little too hasty?

14:53.927 --> 14:57.128
Better safe than sorry. You're going to go
stay with Robert for a while, all right?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.097
Robert might already
be on his way here.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.531
Well, then I can
stay here until he shows.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.468
Why don't we wait
until he arrives

15:03.470 --> 15:06.137
and then we can all
go together, hmm?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.538
( sighs )

15:07.540 --> 15:10.608
<i>- ( insects chirping )
- ( bird screeching )</i>

15:19.386 --> 15:21.319
<i>You burned it down?</i>

15:26.693 --> 15:30.061
Look, we did what we
needed to do, all right?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.563
Well, now it's my turn.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.433
( breathes deeply )
Stay hidden.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.935
Yes, ma'am.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.607
Abraham. Abraham.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.143
- I appreciate your caution...
- <i>( knock on door )</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:48.079
( whispering )
Does Robert have a key?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.215
<i>( knocks )</i>

15:59.025 --> 16:00.625
( rattles )

16:01.594 --> 16:03.394
Evening.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.431
- Are you Samuel Townsend?
- Yes.

16:08.368 --> 16:13.438
I am a friend of your son's.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.008
Would you mind if I come in?
It's quite brisk.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.110
Yes, of course.
I'm so sorry.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.612
<i>( door closes )</i>

16:21.614 --> 16:23.514
Samuel:
<i>May I take your cloak?</i>

16:23.516 --> 16:26.551
Anna:
<i>No, thank you.</i>

16:26.553 --> 16:30.355
I know this is a bit unorthodox.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.323
It's all right.
It's all right.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.126
Abraham is also
a friend of my son's.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.695
Of course I wouldn't expect the
two of you to know each other.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.332
- We do.
- We do.

16:43.403 --> 16:47.338
Mr. Townsend,
my name is Anna Strong

16:47.340 --> 16:50.375
and I have come from General
Washington's camp in Middle Brook.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.210
And now you have to go.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.412
No, I'm afraid you'll have to.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.214
- Anna: <i>I've come with news.</i>
- Abe: <i> Well, it can wait.</i>

16:56.216 --> 16:58.149
- No, it can't.
- Will you give us a moment?

17:00.220 --> 17:03.554
- How did you even get here?
- How do you think? Brewster.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.156
Don't worry, he's been ordered
to stay out of sight.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.526
Your secret's safe.
But Ben knows.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.498
And it's another reason
you're being cut out.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.635
( whispering )
Cut out? Cut me out?

17:17.637 --> 17:20.570
I'm... I'm General Washington's
man on Long Island.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.441
Now, look, if this has anything to do
with what has happened between us...

17:23.443 --> 17:25.476
No, this isn't about that.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.244
This is an order
from Washington.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.579
Letters take too long
to reach him

17:28.581 --> 17:30.448
and we've already
suffered because of it.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.718
Accept it, Abe.
You're out.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.323
Mr. Townsend,
as I was saying,

17:39.325 --> 17:41.692
I have come directly
from Washington's camp

17:41.694 --> 17:45.263
and Mr. Woodhull
can verify that.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.598
<i>From now on, the general
wishes Robert's letters</i>

17:47.600 --> 17:51.269
to be transmitted
by a more direct route.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.504
I will be the new courier.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.405
You?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.374
- Mmm.
- ( scoffs )

17:56.375 --> 17:58.342
- This is all very confusing.
- It does seem so, doesn't it?

17:58.344 --> 18:01.145
First Abraham, then Austin
Roe, and now a woman?

18:01.147 --> 18:02.747
Who's Austin Roe?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.649
( scoffs )

18:08.288 --> 18:09.654
<i>- ( footsteps )
- ( panting )</i>

18:12.459 --> 18:14.692
( panting continues )

18:21.634 --> 18:23.801
( music playing )

18:35.181 --> 18:36.647
( laughing )

18:36.649 --> 18:39.317
Oh, poor Neddy dreads
the postnuptials.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.719
He's convinced he'll lose
his nerve on the big night.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.490
Why wait until then?
Just get it over with.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.260
My husband purchased four ounces of
Spanish fly for our first night.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.195
Right before the thing fell off.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.531
( laughing )

18:53.533 --> 18:55.733
You'll have to excuse Becky.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.368
She's drunk.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.205
Welcome to Penn Mansion.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.307
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- A pleasure to be here.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.276
So kind of you to have us.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.711
Pardon me.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.513
I see you received
our invitation.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.515
On the road, in fact.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.584
Thank you for welcoming
me into your home.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.354
Of course.
Your Excellency,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.556
<i>may I present my fiancíe
Margaret Shipped</i>

19:18.558 --> 19:20.258
<i>of the Philadelphia Shippens.</i>

19:20.260 --> 19:22.760
I believe I am acquainted
with Miss Shippen,

19:22.762 --> 19:25.663
but it cannot be that
this exquisite young woman

19:25.665 --> 19:28.699
is the same 14-year-old
girl who sat across from me

19:28.701 --> 19:30.535
pushing away her string beans.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.537
The general was once
a guest in our home.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.239
He couldn't stop drumming his
fork and knife at the table.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.775
Yes, it is a habit I'm afraid
I've still yet to break.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.711
General Arnold, I have
one request tonight.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.381
- A dance with your intended.
- <i>Of course.</i>

19:43.383 --> 19:46.584
Though I might ask for a moment
of your time in private.

19:46.586 --> 19:50.922
Yes, there is someone first
who begs my attention.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.893
<i>( music stops )</i>

19:58.565 --> 20:00.665
- He's coming right for you, Becky.
- No, you.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.601
My beloved.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.270
<i>Six months is far too long.</i>

20:06.272 --> 20:11.742
So good of our host to admit
you without an escort.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.445
- Are you having a good time, Martha?
- Yes. Yes.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.748
I've had the pleasurable company
of these upstanding young women.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.585
Excuse me, ladies, Miss Redman.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.354
Now, George,
if I could have a moment.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.756
( whispers )

20:27.327 --> 20:30.695
He actually showed.
The stones.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.400
Pardon me.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.339
Madam.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.480
This is going to be
a long night.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.415
We might as well enjoy it, then.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.618
<i>( music playing )</i>

20:53.620 --> 20:56.621
My God, look at the size
of this place, eh?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.735
Becky.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.911
Billy, is something wrong?

21:20.913 --> 21:23.614
These new clothes
the general insisted on,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.316
they's a little tight.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.586
Ah, right, well, why don't you
go and do what you must, eh?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.621
Don't worry, I'll keep an
eye on His Excellency.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.690
<i>( applause )</i>

21:36.863 --> 21:39.997
Peggy:
<i>You seem quite taken.</i>

21:39.999 --> 21:42.333
Yes, well, we don't often see

21:42.335 --> 21:45.503
such beautiful things in camp.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.338
Margaret Shippen.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.508
Ah, yes, soon to be
Arnold, I understand.

21:50.510 --> 21:54.612
I'd expect nothing less
from the intelligence major.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.947
- Tallmadge, yes?
- Yeah.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.783
My fiancí speaks
very highly of you.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.551
You seem to command his respect.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.520
Well, I merely hope
to deserve it.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.755
Mmm, another fan of Cato.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.425
It's Benedict's
favorite play as well.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.663
So are you alone,
Major Tallmadge?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.499
- I am.
- Pity.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.835
Care to dance?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.371
I am at your service.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.540
I should think so.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.575
<i>( music continues )</i>

22:45.631 --> 22:46.897
Will you excuse me, ladies?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.632
- Thank you.
- Women: Your Excellency.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.041
Had the peonies brought in for
Peggy's sister's wedding.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.710
There were a few extra.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.846
Mmm.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.981
George, this court-martial
business.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.084
Now, I know you wish to remain
impartial, and I respect that,

23:07.086 --> 23:09.153
but if you could only see
to bringing up the date...

23:09.155 --> 23:11.655
- Benedict...
- You asked me to step aside.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.592
Now I am willing to do that,
to marry that woman,

23:14.594 --> 23:16.060
to move on with my life,
but I cannot do so

23:16.062 --> 23:17.928
until I've addressed
these accusations. Please.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.798
My love, new guests
have arrived.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.934
Excuse me.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.970
- Of course.
- <i>( applause )</i>

23:29.175 --> 23:32.076
<i>- ( crickets chirping )
- ( distant dog barking )</i>

23:32.078 --> 23:33.944
( snoring )

23:33.946 --> 23:35.913
<i>( twig snaps )</i>

23:48.428 --> 23:50.928
Anna: <i>How many men have
you</i> sent in your stead?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.897
Abe:
<i>Only the one.</i>

23:52.899 --> 23:54.899
I don't even think we need to really
be discussing this right now.

23:54.901 --> 23:55.966
There's other things
on the table.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.969
Ah, the little shit
beat me here.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.138
<i>( argument continues )</i>

24:01.140 --> 24:03.140
- Anna: <i>Why are you yelling?</i>
- Abe: <i> I'm not...</i>

24:03.142 --> 24:05.609
Look, we don't have time
to discuss this, all right?

24:05.611 --> 24:08.712
<i>The Rangers are coming. We need to
leave and we need to leave now.</i>

24:08.714 --> 24:10.948
Oh, the Rangers, I see.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.117
Abe: <i>Anna, you don't
know</i> what you're saying.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.820
- Agh!
- Up against the wall.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.788
- ( gasps )
- Up, all of you.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.957
- Do as he says.
- Now!

24:21.894 --> 24:23.661
Let her go.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.162
- Drop your iron.
- You drop yours.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.665
Caleb, do it.
It's all right.

24:27.667 --> 24:31.235
- Abe? What the... what are you doing here?
- I know, shh. Stop it.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.170
- Get out of the way.
- I know him!

24:37.210 --> 24:39.877
All right?

24:39.879 --> 24:40.978
It's all right.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.913
What in God's name is going on?

24:42.915 --> 24:45.182
Of course you know him.
It's Austin Roe.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.985
No, it's Robert Rogers.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.920
Made an impression,
didn't I, Mrs. Strong?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.755
Rogers, we are on
the same side here.

24:51.757 --> 24:53.524
- What?!
- But if you hurt her, you die.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.026
You're in no position
to threaten me.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.662
I warned you
not to follow me, boy.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.866
- What's he talking about, Abe?
- And who are you?

25:01.868 --> 25:04.001
His name is Brewster,
his name is Rogers,

25:04.003 --> 25:06.704
but none of our names are
gonna mean shit past tonight

25:06.706 --> 25:08.105
once the Rangers show up.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.074
We all just need to leave.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.209
We're not going anywhere.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.178
I came here to see
Robert Townsend

25:14.180 --> 25:16.914
<i>and I'm not leaving
till I see Robert Townsend.</i>

25:16.916 --> 25:18.749
<i>And neither are any of you.</i>

25:18.751 --> 25:20.084
What do you want with my son?

25:20.086 --> 25:23.687
Same thing all these
children want... information.

25:23.689 --> 25:27.591
Look, Simcoe is coming here.

25:27.593 --> 25:31.795
Well, Long Island's
a very big place

25:31.797 --> 25:34.632
and we've got plenty of time.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.535
<i>- ( dishes shattering )</i>
- Man: <i> Get down.</i>

25:37.537 --> 25:39.036
<i>( woman screaming )
No, no!</i>

25:39.038 --> 25:41.272
- ( whimpering )
- Man #2: <i> Let my wife go!</i>

25:41.274 --> 25:43.274
Simcoe:
<i>Then answer the question.</i>

25:43.276 --> 25:46.243
Fugitive... burly, bearded,
wears a patch over one eye.

25:46.245 --> 25:51.649
- Have you seen him?
- How dare you come in my... ah!

25:51.651 --> 25:54.184
I haven't seen him.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.287
<i>- ( man grunts )
- ( woman crying )</i>

25:56.289 --> 25:58.856
Man:
<i>Nice.</i>

25:58.858 --> 26:02.126
18 homesteads.
Not bad for a day's work.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.895
We'll be at this for weeks
unless we narrow the search.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.831
He nearly put a round
through your skull, Falkoff.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.833
Falkoff: <i>Well, we did
enter</i> without knocking.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.802
Not every town is Setauket.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.837
Most haven't
collected all the guns.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.340
- ( crying )
- ( grunts )

26:22.882 --> 26:25.049
On our way to Monmouth
we passed a town

26:25.051 --> 26:27.117
popular among Quakers.
What was the name?

26:27.119 --> 26:30.354
- Oyster Bay.
- Quakers don't carry guns.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.223
That's the idea.
Let's go.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.132
<i>( music playing )</i>

27:02.388 --> 27:05.255
- How many more must I oblige?
- Oh.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.629
Master at yet another field.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.965
I expect such deftness when you come
to dance with Congress this week.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.868
- Joseph.
- It's wonderful to see you again, madam.

27:17.870 --> 27:22.106
Now, rumor has it, sir, that
you've come about the money.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.341
Retire and recall all bills.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.211
Your spies are better than mine.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.413
I had hoped to count
on your support.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.050
I noticed you speaking
with our host.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.219
As would be expected
in his home.

27:35.221 --> 27:38.322
General Arnold was merely inquiring
as to the date of the court-martial.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.992
And so once again the man tries
to evade the proper channels.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.362
I don't fault you, sir.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.232
Arnold is just trying to take
advantage of your good nature.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.368
The postponement has lasted
long enough, don't you think?

27:51.370 --> 27:53.437
I need that time
to gather evidence.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.240
Every rock we overturn
reveals new facts

27:56.242 --> 27:58.108
begging to be brought to light.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.210
That's his hurry.

28:00.212 --> 28:04.982
I'd advise you to let this
play out naturally, sir.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.354
You have become quite deft
yourself, Joseph.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.289
Well...

28:12.291 --> 28:15.192
it seems I've misplaced my wife.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.295
Excuse me.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.168
I never liked
that little weevil.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.336
- Yes, but now you see the problem.
- I do.

28:26.338 --> 28:29.473
- If I support Arnold...
- You lose Reed's support in Congress.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.909
Well, that is not the problem.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.144
The problem is
the very certain fact

28:34.146 --> 28:35.879
you will have to make at
least one of them unhappy.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.149
- I wish to remain impartial.
- You wish to be liked.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.919
No, not liked, I...

28:41.921 --> 28:43.387
respected by the men.

28:43.389 --> 28:47.224
No, George,
you want to be liked.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.101
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- Ben: Excuse me.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.069
<i>( door closes )</i>

28:59.071 --> 29:02.206
Ahem, General, sir.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.508
Tallmadge.
I hadn't seen you.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.010
Thank you for the invitation
here this evening.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.413
- My pleasure.
- It's a grand affair.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.015
I've not attended many
to which I can compare it,

29:12.017 --> 29:15.919
but I can't imagine most feature
a lacquer-finished dance floor.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.956
You've truly spared no expense.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.258
Is there something
that you wish to say, Major?

29:21.260 --> 29:25.996
Or do you presume to know the content
of my private ledgers as well?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.799
Uh, no, of course not, sir.
I would never...

29:28.801 --> 29:33.203
If you are uncomfortable in my home,
Major, then you can leave at any time.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.305
Sir, I...

29:36.242 --> 29:39.476
( ticking )

30:20.486 --> 30:22.853
Father?

30:25.991 --> 30:30.160
Mr. Townsend,
welcome.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.930
<i>Sit down.</i>

30:32.932 --> 30:35.866
Do it, son.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.507
Arms on the table.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.313
<i>Now then, Culper Jr.,</i>

30:49.315 --> 30:53.050
you recently penned a letter
to our plucky farmer here

30:53.052 --> 30:56.920
concerning a Major John
André and the young woman

30:56.922 --> 31:00.090
who recently turned his head.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.491
What's her name?

31:01.493 --> 31:03.744
Who is this woman?

31:03.745 --> 31:05.996
Oh, you haven't met
her before, have you?

31:05.998 --> 31:08.198
She's one of your merry band.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.533
Let her go.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.569
Maybe I haven't
introduced myself.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.906
My name is Robert Rogers

31:15.908 --> 31:18.909
and I don't aim
to be here all night.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.577
What will you do
with the information?

31:20.579 --> 31:23.513
I'm gonna use it
to get close to André.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.948
You won't get close enough.

31:24.950 --> 31:27.885
I'm not talking to you!

31:27.887 --> 31:29.219
Abe:
<i>He's too well guarded.</i>

31:29.221 --> 31:31.655
And once they catch you
and torture you,

31:31.657 --> 31:34.458
you'll give away this ring
and I cannot let that happen.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.661
I was leading the Queen's
Rangers against the Iroquois

31:37.663 --> 31:42.633
<i>before you even had hairs
on your chin, boy.</i>

31:42.635 --> 31:45.135
<i>- What can you do to me?</i>
- Abe: <i> I can make you</i> a promise.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.004
You let this lot
do what we do best

31:47.006 --> 31:48.505
and we'll get André for you.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.307
But if you do not
put that gun down,

31:50.309 --> 31:52.976
you will not be walking
out of this room alive.

31:59.318 --> 32:03.053
Now, we are all gonna stand up

32:03.055 --> 32:06.089
and walk out
of this room slowly.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.625
- You're him.
- We're...

32:08.627 --> 32:11.395
- What?
- What?

32:11.397 --> 32:12.963
It's you.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.266
You're the Queen's Ranger.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.669
- Shite.
- What?

32:18.671 --> 32:20.537
- No.
- Yes, you are.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.139
- <i>No.</i>
- Yes, you are!

32:22.141 --> 32:24.274
<i>You attacked me and you
burned down my farm.</i>

32:24.276 --> 32:27.077
- What is this?
- Here we go.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.981
Woodhull, is this true?

32:34.253 --> 32:38.255
This is true.
I told him to.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.290
Why?

32:41.327 --> 32:44.261
To manipulate me.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.564
To trick me into
undertaking this business.

32:48.701 --> 32:51.068
- Yeah.
- You lied.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.437
- Yes, I lied. I had no other choice.
- You always have a choice.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.639
How would you know? You never
chose, I chose for you.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.575
Because you couldn't
do it yourself.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.278
<i>( object thuds )</i>

33:01.280 --> 33:02.579
Mr. Rogers.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.685
The woman's name
is Philomena Cheer.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.339
She is an actress.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.390
You will often find her at
Rivington's on Wall Street.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.060
Ah, yes, the actress.

33:17.062 --> 33:20.097
I remember her.
I can use her.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.534
Well, it's been a great pleasure

33:24.536 --> 33:27.070
<i>watching the amateur
dramatics tonight,</i>

33:27.072 --> 33:30.374
but if you don't mind, it's getting
to be that hour of twilight.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.543
- So, you, unprime your firelock.
- No chance.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.579
I have already got what I want,

33:35.581 --> 33:37.647
so I can kill anyone I like.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.083
But it just seems such a shame

33:40.085 --> 33:43.320
to waste a bullet on this, eh?

33:45.090 --> 33:47.124
So blow your powder
out your pan.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.163
That's it.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.337
I used to like you, boy.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.372
I did.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.307
But I warned you
not to cross me.

34:04.309 --> 34:07.077
- Anna: <i> No!</i>
- Robert: Like you said,

34:07.079 --> 34:09.478
it'd be a shame
to waste a bullet.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.581
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

34:16.621 --> 34:18.422
An armed Quaker.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.291
Who'd have guessed it?
( laughs )

34:31.170 --> 34:34.170
You gonna kill me, "Friend"?

34:37.141 --> 34:40.143
Robert: <i>The spirit of Christ</i>
will never move us to war

34:40.145 --> 34:42.746
<i>against any man
with outward weapons.</i>

34:44.382 --> 34:46.416
You leave this house.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.566
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

35:02.568 --> 35:05.235
Hah!

35:05.237 --> 35:07.471
- ( clicks )
- Bollocks!

35:07.473 --> 35:09.673
( laughing )

35:12.311 --> 35:14.277
Bloody Quakers.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.319
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

35:28.160 --> 35:31.561
You have been
avoiding me all night.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.130
You're drunk.
You look horrid.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.831
What is the matter with you?

35:37.336 --> 35:39.402
I'm sorry, Peggy.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.339
About all of it.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.474
All of what?

35:44.476 --> 35:46.376
I didn't know how to tell you.

35:46.378 --> 35:49.179
Tell me what?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.347
About Freddy.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.449
Freddy?

35:54.386 --> 35:56.686
You heard from Freddy
in New York?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.423
And André.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.227
<i>About André.</i>

36:05.731 --> 36:09.232
Becky, what are you
talking about?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.808
Philomena?

36:20.445 --> 36:22.646
Becky, who's Philomena?

36:27.419 --> 36:29.519
Oh.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.688
Are you all right, dear?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.557
Mm-hmm.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.892
Robert:
<i>I want you gone.</i>

36:35.894 --> 36:37.928
We need you and you know it.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.197
- Yes, and it wasn't personal, all right?
- Robert, listen to me.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.831
You won't have to deal
with Abe anymore, only me.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.934
You think that I would
trust any of you?

36:43.936 --> 36:46.670
<i>You can't even trust each other.</i>

36:47.906 --> 36:50.273
<i>( distant horse neighs )</i>

36:51.543 --> 36:54.911
( horses neighing )

36:54.913 --> 36:56.980
- It's not over. It's not over.
- Come on, come on.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.482
Abe, come on. Woody, come on.
Get over here.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.920
( whispering ) Come on! Come on!
Down, down, down.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.862
<i>( door bursts open )</i>

37:12.864 --> 37:14.464
Simcoe:
<i>You can relax, men.</i>

37:14.466 --> 37:15.966
<i>They're Quakers.</i>

37:31.750 --> 37:33.717
Okay, all right, let's go.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.019
No, no, no. If Simcoe takes him
captive, we'll never get him back.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.956
- Then what?
- Look, we can't just leave them.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.826
We're looking for a man
goes by the name of Culper.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.962
- Have you seen anyone?
- Yes, there was a man.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.964
He broke in,
he demanded supplies.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.567
And left his weapon?

37:50.569 --> 37:54.738
He called that a gift

37:54.740 --> 37:57.274
to protect ourselves from any...

37:58.644 --> 38:00.977
unfriendly elements, he said.

38:00.979 --> 38:04.981
Yes, seems to think
himself quite the jester.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.951
He had another weapon
which he took with him,

38:07.953 --> 38:11.488
along with a bite of our turkey.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.323
His name wasn't Culper, though.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.660
It was Rogers.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.598
- Keep riding west, then?
- No.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.700
- But he said Rogers...
- Left his weapon.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.337
The last man to follow Rogers'
tracks took a blade to his throat.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.406
I prefer mine intact.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.007
Well, then where to?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.776
Setauket.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.683
Shh.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.052
<i>( hoofbeats departing )</i>

38:46.892 --> 38:48.625
All right, let's go back inside.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.627
- No.
- I need to talk to him.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.813
- You're not...
- Let me talk to him.

38:52.814 --> 38:55.054
No, you're gonna make this
worse if you go back in there.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.348
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

39:31.603 --> 39:34.771
I've given this much thought.

39:34.773 --> 39:38.375
You see, I must put this country
ahead of everything else.

39:38.377 --> 39:41.611
And aggravating valuable
members of Congress

39:41.613 --> 39:44.447
at a time like this
is no small matter.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.017
But neither is turning away

39:48.019 --> 39:52.589
this army's most
devoted, honorable men.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.591
I will speak to Knox
and the other generals.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.627
We will get this matter
settled quickly.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.829
You will have your day
before the Board of Inquiry.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.165
It is the least you are owed.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.835

40:24.656 --> 40:26.423
Come back here at week's end.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.128
I'll be here
with Mary and Thomas.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.697
We're coming to you.
Samuel Culper's finished.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.636
- Abe...
- No.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.440
I know what failure looks like, Caleb.
The ring is done.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.179
So am I.

40:51.716 --> 40:53.850
You didn't fail, Abe.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.519
You served.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.025
No one could have
done what you did

41:02.027 --> 41:04.160
for as long as you have.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.204
I have yet to dance
with the hostess.

41:14.206 --> 41:17.040
Miss Shippen...
would you indulge me?

Ah, Billy, there you are.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.939
Had to undo a few stiches.

41:49.941 --> 41:53.109
Right. Why, did he not
have you measured?

41:53.111 --> 41:54.978
He did.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.246
Spent the whole day
with him, too.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.214
He didn't even notice.

41:58.216 --> 42:02.252
Suppose we've all so many mickles
and muckles on our minds,

42:02.254 --> 42:05.522
it's the things right in front
of our eyes get missed.
