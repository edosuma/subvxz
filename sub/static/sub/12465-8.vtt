WEBVTT

00:05.272 --> 00:09.641
( snoring )

00:11.245 --> 00:13.278
UH-- UGH!

00:13.280 --> 00:16.181
HMM, THERE'S ENOUGH OF ME
TO GO AROUND, LADIES.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.952
( shrieks )

00:19.954 --> 00:22.187
A LITTLE PRIVACY, PLEASE!

00:22.189 --> 00:24.690
LET ME GUESS.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.924
YOU WERE SLEEPING
IN THE HALLWAY

00:25.926 --> 00:29.228
BECAUSE YOUR ROOM
IS DISGUSTING.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.729
( gags ) OH!

00:31.799 --> 00:34.199
THE HALL IS
MY ONLY OPTION, KAREN.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.936
PARKER AND I HAVEN'T
CLEANED OUR ROOM IN SO LONG

00:37.938 --> 00:39.772
THAT WE GOT USED
TO LIVING IN OUR OWN FILTH.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.474
AND NOW THERE'S
FUZZ ON THE FILTH

00:42.476 --> 00:44.243
AND IT'S JUST SCARY.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.945
IT'S LIKE
ZOMBIES-THAT-CAN-OPEN-DOORS
SCARY.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.715
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING
A GAME OF CHICKEN WITH THE BOYS,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.984
ASSUMING THEIR ROOM
WOULD GET SO GROSS,
THEY'D CLEAN IT.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.820
NEVER PLAY CHICKEN
WITH PIGS.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.422
THAT'S IT.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.257
YOU CLEAN YOUR ROOM
BY TOMORROW

00:58.259 --> 00:59.792
OR I AM THROWING
EVERYTHING OUT.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.060
<i>EVERYTHING!</i>

01:01.062 --> 01:02.394
DON'T CALL ME KAREN.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.533
( squeaks )

01:08.936 --> 01:11.470
WOW, SHE'S MAD.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.671
WAFFLES?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.708
OVER THE YEARS, I'VE DUG
AN INTRICATE SYSTEM OF TUNNELS

01:16.710 --> 01:19.495
IN AND AROUND OUR HOUSE.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.281
MY FAVORITE IS THE ONE THAT
GETS ME TO THE BATHROOM FAST

01:22.283 --> 01:23.515
OR MAYBE THE ONE
THAT GETS ME

01:23.517 --> 01:25.684
TO THE APE EXHIBIT
AT THE ZOO.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.822
THEY GO CRAZY
WHEN YOU HIDE THEIR TIRE.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.757
WELL, PARKER.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.959
GUESS IT'S FINALLY TIME
TO CLEAN OUR ROOM.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.994
YOU START AND I'LL
GO GET THE CHISEL

01:35.996 --> 01:37.663
FOR OUR BUBBLE GUM WALL.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.331
HOLD.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.967
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO TRICK SOMEONE

01:41.969 --> 01:43.802
INTO CLEANING IT
FOR US.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.504
PERHAPS--
OH, I DON'T KNOW--

01:45.506 --> 01:47.406
THE TWINKIE-DINKS.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.876
UH, I LOVE THE COLOR
OF YOUR GREY MATTER.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.645
I ALSO LOVE SYRUP
ON MY WAFFLES,

01:53.647 --> 01:55.814
WHICH YOU FORGOT.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.616

<i>WHY'RE YOU TAKING</i>

02:59.847 --> 03:01.813
ALL OF MY CLOTHES
OUT OF OUR CLOSET?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.782
OH, BECAUSE, MADDIE,
WE HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.051
I GET 80% OF THE HANGING SPACE
FOR MY FABOOSH OUTFITS

03:06.053 --> 03:08.987
AND YOU GET 20% FOR
YOUR SPORTS COSTUMES.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.023
RIGHT, BUT, LIV,
THAT WAS BEFORE

03:11.025 --> 03:12.491
I DECIDED
TO FRESHEN UP MY LOOK.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.926
YEAH?  I MEAN, JUST
BECAUSE I'M A JOCK

03:13.928 --> 03:15.661
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I HAVE
TO WEAR SWEATS ALL THE TIME.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.529
- UM--
- UH, OKAY, ZIP IT.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.965
I'M AWARE THAT
I'M WEARING SWEATS RIGHT NOW.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.633
RIGHT, OKAY.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.902
MADDIE, KUDOS TO YOU
ON YOUR NEW LOOK.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.904
REALLY, BUT, UM,
LET'S FACE IT.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.540
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A DRAWER GIRL.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.908
I'M A HANGER GIRL.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.778
YOU KNOW, WE'D HAVE
PLENTY OF CLOSET SPACE

03:32.780 --> 03:34.646
IF YOU GOT RID OF
SOME OF YOUR EXTRA SHOES.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.515
UM...

03:36.517 --> 03:37.883
SORRY, I'M JUST--

03:37.885 --> 03:39.384
I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.019
WHAT ARE EXTRA SHOES?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.955
( laughs, snorts )

03:42.957 --> 03:44.523
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT

03:44.525 --> 03:47.059
I AM A HANGER GIRL NOW
SO I NEED MY SPACE.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.528
OKAY, FINE.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.096
FAIR ENOUGH.
UH...

03:51.098 --> 03:52.464
YES!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.600
I AM PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU

03:54.602 --> 03:57.669
THREE EXTRA HANGERS
<i>AND </i> A SWEATER CUBBY.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.837
THIS IS REALLY GOOD DEAL,
MADDIE.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.172
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO TAKE THIS ONE.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.107
OKAY.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.942
UM, I AM PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU

04:03.944 --> 04:05.477
A FRONT-ROW SEAT

- TO THE CLOSET WARS!
- OWW! WHAT?!

04:08.015 --> 04:09.114
MADDIE, NO!
NO NO NO NO!

04:09.116 --> 04:11.083
OKAY, OKAY!
UM, UH...

04:11.085 --> 04:13.185
REVISED DEAL!
UH, FOUR EXTRA HANGERS

YEAH?!

04:15.422 --> 04:16.989
WHAT MORE CAN
I GIVE YOU?!

04:19.159 --> 04:22.194
Liv: <i> I SAID GET RID</i>
<i>OF THESE STUPID SHOES!</i>

04:22.196 --> 04:25.063
( screams )
DON'T SCREAM
IN THE HOUSE!

04:26.967 --> 04:29.134
SCREAMING "DON'T SCREAM"

04:29.136 --> 04:31.036
PROBABLY SENDS
A MIXED MESSAGE, HUH?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.006
LET THEM FIGHT.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.507
LOOK, IF THE GIRLS
ARE FIGHTING

04:35.509 --> 04:36.808
AND THE BOYS ARE
CLEANING THEIR ROOM,

04:36.810 --> 04:38.977
WE HAVE THE DAY
TO OURSELVES.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.979
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.782
I BELIEVE I AM.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.452
Both: "PRESIDENT BABY"!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.688
( deeper pitch )
IN A WORLD SO CORRUPT

04:49.690 --> 04:51.556
THERE WAS NO ONE
LEFT TO TRUST,

04:51.558 --> 04:53.492
THE VOTERS
OF AMERICA TURNED

04:53.494 --> 04:57.029
TO THE ONLY INNOCENT VOICE
LEFT IN POLITICS.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.732
ALL HAIL PRESIDENT BABY.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.834
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.970
A DIAPER CHANGE.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.806
WE HAVE BEEN DYING
TO SEE "PRESIDENT BABY"

05:07.808 --> 05:09.241
SINCE IT CAME OUT
IN THE THEATERS,

05:09.243 --> 05:11.076
BUT WE NEVER MADE IT
BECAUSE WE'RE PARENTS.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.112
SO LAST NIGHT
WE DOWNLOADED IT

05:14.114 --> 05:15.480
AND FELL ASLEEP

05:15.482 --> 05:17.149
BECAUSE WE'RE PARENTS.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.785
IF WE DON'T FINISH WATCHING
BEFORE THE RENTAL EXPIRES,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.987
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY
FIVE BUCKS AGAIN.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.756
IT'S THE FIFTH TIME
WE'VE TRIED WATCHING.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.858
I REALLY WANT TO SEE
"PRESIDENT BABY,"

05:26.860 --> 05:29.895
BUT I DRAW THE LINE
AT 25 BUCKS.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.065
- <i> ( television music plays )</i>
- <i> ( baby cries )</i>

05:35.169 --> 05:37.669
THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT A POWERFUL BABY

05:37.671 --> 05:41.973
THAT JUST MAKES YOU PROUD
TO BE AN AMERICAN.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.208
ALL RIGHT, LIV, IT IS TIME
FOR YOU TO PICK

05:43.210 --> 05:45.010
YOUR FIVE FAVORITE
PAIRS OF RED SHOES.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.511
AND THE REST ARE GOING
IN THE GARAGE.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.146
( gasps )
YOU'RE TRYING
TO BREAK UP

05:48.148 --> 05:49.214
OUR HAPPY CLOSET FAMILY?

05:49.216 --> 05:50.515
YOU MONSTER!

05:50.517 --> 05:53.352
<i>( door opens )</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:56.188
( in British accent )
DO I HEAR A LITTLE STRIFE
IN THE PRINCESS CASTLE?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.589
STAY OUT OF THIS, JOEY.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.224
WE'VE COME WITH A SOLUTION,

05:59.226 --> 06:01.226
BUT ONLY
IF MADDIE'S BRAVE ENOUGH

06:01.228 --> 06:03.929
TO TAKE ME ON IN A GAME
OF REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.531
I'M LISTENING.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.033
OKAY, SO IN
REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE,

06:08.035 --> 06:10.102
EACH PERSON HAS TO
EAT SOMETHING REALLY GROSS

06:10.104 --> 06:12.054
FROM THE DEEP RECESSES
OF THE FRIDGE.

06:12.055 --> 06:14.005
THE GAME IS OVER WHEN YOU GET
SOMETHING SO DISGUSTING

06:14.007 --> 06:15.574
THAT YOU REFUSE TO EAT IT.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.910
AND I'VE NEVER REFUSED
TO EAT ANYTHING.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.749
OH!

06:23.751 --> 06:26.685
SERIOUSLY, IT TASTES
LIKE APPLE PIE, YOU GUYS.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.954
MOM'S MAKING US
CLEAN THE BRO' CAVE.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.122
<i>IF MADDIE WINS,</i>
<i>YOU TWO</i>

06:30.124 --> 06:32.991
CAN YOU USE OUR
FRESHLY SANITIZED CLOSET

06:32.993 --> 06:35.227
FOR WHATEVER
WEIRD LADY THINGS
YOU WANT.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.596
BUT IF I WIN,

06:37.598 --> 06:40.298
YOU TWO BOBBLEHEADS HAVE
TO CLEAN OUR ROOM TODAY.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.133
( both gasp )

06:41.135 --> 06:42.234
NO, I'M SORRY.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.335
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT I'M GOING

06:43.337 --> 06:44.803
INTO THAT CHAMBER
OF BOY STENCH.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.572
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.141
THEN ENJOY YOUR CLOSET WAR.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.610
UM, WAIT!  LIV,

06:51.612 --> 06:54.012
I'VE NEVER LOST A GAME
OF REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.213
MADDIE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.249
OUR CLOSET HAS
A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.851
OKAY, WE'RE IN.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.262
WELCOME BACK
TO "FOUL FRIDGE"
FOR ROUND SIX

07:10.264 --> 07:13.131
OF REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.167
<i>PARKER AND MADDIE</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:17.736
ARE LOCKED IN A HEATED
BITE-FOR-BITE BATTLE OF BLECH

07:17.738 --> 07:20.872
AND CLEANING THE BRO' CAVE
IS ON THE LINE.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.141
OKAY, DUDE,
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.910
NO ONE ELSE
IS WATCHING.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.112
OKAY, SO I KNEW
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE

07:27.114 --> 07:28.614
TO SUPPORT MY SISTER,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.115
BUT EVEN WATCHING PARKER
EAT NORMAL FOOD

07:30.117 --> 07:32.050
MAKES ME KINDA NAUSEOUS.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.218
THIS ITEM

07:33.220 --> 07:35.787
COULD BE MOM'S
LEFTOVER ENCHILADAS

07:35.789 --> 07:37.622
FROM HER GUATEMALAN
COOKING PHASE

07:37.624 --> 07:39.024
OR WHAT USED TO BE TROUT

07:39.026 --> 07:41.293
FROM DAD'S
LAST FISHING TRIP.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.129
JUST REMEMBER
IF YOU HAVE TO SPEW,

07:44.131 --> 07:45.330
HIT THE SINK.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.332
THESE ARE MY ONLY
CLEAN PANTS.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.838
OKAY.
( clears throat )

07:54.775 --> 07:56.141
OKAY.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.784
NOPE, NO.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.158
I-- I-- OKAY, I--
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.092
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.861
BUT I'M OUT.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.063
OKAY, I'M REALLY TOUGH,

08:18.065 --> 08:21.066
BUT DAD
HAS NOT BEEN FISHING
IN THREE YEARS.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.068
OH, SO ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS EAT THIS

08:23.070 --> 08:25.003
- AND WE WIN.
- YEAH, EXCEPT THERE'S

08:25.005 --> 08:26.137
<i>NO WAY THAT YOU'RE--</i>

08:26.139 --> 08:27.739
NO, YOU ATE THAT!

08:28.909 --> 08:30.375
UGH!

08:30.377 --> 08:34.246
RELAX,
IT'S JUST GROUND BEEF,
CHOCOLATE TAFFY,

08:34.248 --> 08:37.215
AND DRIED SEAWEED
I DYED TO LOOK MOLDY
AND TROUT-LIKE.

08:37.217 --> 08:41.119
I KNOW THAT'S CHEATING,
BUT I'M NOT CLEANING OUR ROOM.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.088
MY BED IS CRUNCHY.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.156
( laughs )

08:45.158 --> 08:47.826
PARKER, YOU DISGUST
AND DELIGHT ME.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.362
WHY THANK YOU.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.964
MADISON!

08:52.966 --> 08:54.766
GET TO CLEANING.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.736
OKAY, SO NOW I HAVE
TO CLEAN THE BOYS' ROOM.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.004
HA.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.405
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.207
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?!

09:02.209 --> 09:03.275
HA HA.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.918
WORSE THAN I...

09:12.920 --> 09:15.253
IMAGINED.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.391
OH, I CAN
SEE THE SMELL.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.127
HAVE FUN, LADIES.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.095
I HOPE YOUR BOTH
FULLY VACCINATED.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.899
- HA.
- ( slithering )

09:27.901 --> 09:29.100
- SOMETHING'S MOVING!
- ( screams )

09:29.102 --> 09:30.201
- WHAT IS THAT?!
- SOMETHING'S MOVING!

09:30.203 --> 09:31.236
( both scream )

09:33.273 --> 09:35.974
( sighs )

09:35.976 --> 09:37.375
I GUESS I SHOULD START
WITH PULLING

09:37.377 --> 09:40.478
THE DIRTY UNDERWEAR OFF
THE DEAD CHRISTMAS TREE

09:40.480 --> 09:45.417
THAT HAS BEEN PLANTED
IN A TOILET BOWL.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.185
( sniffs )

09:47.187 --> 09:49.304
HA!

09:49.305 --> 09:51.422
NICE JOB, MISS "I NEVER LOSE
AT REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE."

09:51.425 --> 09:52.490
<i>NOW THANKS TO YOU,</i>

09:52.492 --> 09:54.292
WE'RE STUCK IN HERE

09:54.294 --> 09:58.063
WITH JOEY'S JEANS
THAT CAN, UH,

09:58.065 --> 10:00.131
STAND ON THEIR OWN.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.068
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LIV?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.236
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE HAD TO PLAY

10:05.238 --> 10:06.438
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN

10:06.440 --> 10:08.239
- SUCH A CLOSET HOG.
- <i> ( squishes )</i>

10:10.143 --> 10:11.843
( exasperated laugh )

10:11.845 --> 10:13.812
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA LOOK DOWN.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.547
I'M SIMPLY GOING
TO BURN THIS SNEAKER.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.484
UGH!  I SURE HOPE
I DON'T GET A RASH

10:19.486 --> 10:21.419
FROM THIS BEANBAG-- NO!

10:22.522 --> 10:24.322
MADDIE?!

10:27.361 --> 10:30.061
OH!

10:30.063 --> 10:31.830
THE CHAIR ATE MY SISTER.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.069
UGH, WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.404
MAYBE WE BROUGHT IT
WITH US?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.505
( sniffs )

10:40.507 --> 10:43.141
NO, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.175
( inhales deeply )

10:44.177 --> 10:46.044
STRANGE.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.380
UGH, THOSE FLOWERS,
GROSS.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.482
HEY, DO YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT CHEATING THE GIRLS

10:50.484 --> 10:52.050
AT REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.852
THE GIRLS WHO TOLD ME

10:53.854 --> 10:55.553
TO HAND OVER ALL
MY HALLOWEEN CANDY

10:55.555 --> 10:58.823
OR THE EVIL SCOTTISH LORD
GOOMERY-GOO WOULD GET ME?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.159
THEY TORTURED ME
WITH THAT FOR YEARS.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.928
THEY USED TO PLAY BAGPIPES
THROUGH THE VENT

11:03.930 --> 11:05.497
AND TELL ME
HE WAS COMING.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.199
THAT'S SCARY FOR
A LITTLE KID.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.901
( laughs, snorts )

11:09.903 --> 11:12.604
OKAY, SO WHEN
PARKER WAS FIVE,

11:12.606 --> 11:13.972
WE TOLD HIM
THAT IF HE DIDN'T GIVE US

11:13.974 --> 11:15.273
ALL OF HIS PIGGY BANK MONEY,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.842
THE GOOMERY-GOO WOULD COME UP
THROUGH THE TOILET

11:17.844 --> 11:19.244
AND DRAG HIM DOWN
INTO THE SEWERS.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.912
HA.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.213
( sighs )
ALL OF HIS LITTLE PENNIES

11:22.215 --> 11:24.416
BOUGHT ME
A SUPER SWEET KICKBALL.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.618
( in Scottish accent )
SLEEP TIGHT, PARKA'.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.320
DON'T LET
THE GOOMERY-GOO GET YA'.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.889
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.390
THE GIRLS DESERVE THIS.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.360
NOW I'M GONNA TAKE
A DIVA MOMENT JOEY-STYLE.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.861
HIT IT!

11:38.331 --> 11:39.431
( grunts )

11:43.036 --> 11:45.170
FLEXIN'.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.104
( screams )

11:46.106 --> 11:47.272
CRAMPIN'.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.506
( high pitched )
<i>OWW!</i>

11:48.508 --> 11:49.541
CRAMPIN'!

11:49.543 --> 11:51.209
<i>( electrical buzzing )</i>

11:51.211 --> 11:55.413
I'M TOLD COORDINATION
IS A SENIOR-YEAR KIND OF THING.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.248
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I STARTED TO FALL

11:57.250 --> 11:59.918
AND I REACHED BACK
FOR SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.360
YOU OKAY?

12:09.362 --> 12:12.263
BEST DIVA MOMENT EVER,
BY THE WAY.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.533
I BROKE THE DIVA BOARD.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.102
( squeaky )
LIV'S GONNA KILL ME!

12:17.104 --> 12:18.369
Liv:
<i>PARKER, I NEED YOU!</i>

12:18.371 --> 12:20.972
( high-pitch shrieks )

12:20.974 --> 12:23.975
GO!  LIV CAN'T SEE THIS!

12:23.977 --> 12:26.678
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
DEALING WITH LIV

12:26.680 --> 12:28.213
WHEN SHE'S AGITATED,

12:28.215 --> 12:31.282
BUT I HAD TO GET AWAY
FROM JOEY'S LADY SHRIEKS.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.384
( nervous chuckle )

12:33.386 --> 12:36.688
HEY, UM, SO THIS MIGHT
SOUND REALLY CRAZY,

12:36.690 --> 12:39.224
BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF
YOUR CHAIRS ATE MADDIE.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.526
SO, LIKE, IS THAT
AT ALL POSSIBLE?

12:41.528 --> 12:44.429
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE
IN THE BRO' CAVE.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.264
WHICH CHAIR?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.299
- THAT BEANBAG ONE.
- WHAT?!

12:50.137 --> 12:52.070
OH, WE'VE GOT
A MAJOR SITUATION HERE.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.605
THAT'S THE ENTRANCE

12:53.606 --> 12:55.139
TO ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
PARKER TUNNELS.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.574
( mimics explosion )

12:56.576 --> 12:58.977
TOTALLY FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.045
HOW COULD YOU FORGET TO TELL ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

13:01.047 --> 13:03.248
HEY, YOU'VE GOT SHOES.
I'VE GOT TUNNELS.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.717
KINDA HARD TO KEEP
TRACK OF THEM ALL.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.585
BUT MANTIS MAN
CAN HELP US.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.655
( beeping )

13:10.657 --> 13:12.590
<i>THIS IS A MAP</i>
<i>OF ALL MY TUNNELS.</i>

13:12.592 --> 13:15.226
EACH ONE HAS
A HEAT SENSOR TO
DETECT MOTION,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.428
WHICH APPEARS AS
A BLIP ON THE GRID.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.063
OH, A BLIP!
I SEE A BLIP!

13:19.065 --> 13:20.965
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT
A HEAT MASS ON THE MOVE

13:20.967 --> 13:23.101
IN SECTOR SEVEN.
IT MUST BE MADDIE.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.638
( whispers )
YOU NEVER SAW THIS.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.008
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN
SECTOR SEVEN IN YEARS.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.543
WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S DOWN THERE.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.712
WELL, I AM COMING
WITH YOU.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.348
AND I'M NOT TAKING
NO FOR AN ANSWER.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.317
DUH, OF COURSE
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.720
I DON'T WANT
TO GO DOWN THERE.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.190
DOESN'T HE RECOGNIZE
A NOBLE, EMPTY GESTURE

13:45.192 --> 13:46.324
WHEN HE HEARS IT?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.561
OH, GOOD THINKING.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.129
WE WILL LEAVE A TRAIL
OF BREAD CRUMBS

13:51.131 --> 13:52.848
TO FIND OUR WAY BACK.

13:52.849 --> 13:54.566
YOU'RE SWEET, KID,
BUT THIS IS FOR THE RATS.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.301
THEY GET TESTY
WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.674
BOMBS AWAY!

14:02.676 --> 14:04.609
( gasps )

14:06.346 --> 14:08.613
UM, DO YOU THINK
I HAVE TIME

14:08.615 --> 14:10.315
TO CHANGE INTO
MY TUNNELING SHOES?

14:10.317 --> 14:12.217
Parker:
<i>JUST GET IN HERE, PRINCESS.</i>

14:12.219 --> 14:14.018
( groans )

14:14.020 --> 14:15.153
( inhales deeply )

14:15.155 --> 14:16.387
EWW.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.355
( gasp )

14:20.293 --> 14:22.660
<i>( baby crying )</i>

14:22.662 --> 14:25.096
MOM, DAD!

14:25.098 --> 14:26.197
( startled gasps )

14:26.199 --> 14:29.500
<i>( movie credits plays )</i>

14:29.502 --> 14:32.637
YOU WATCHED
"PRESIDENT BABY"
WITHOUT ME?!

14:32.639 --> 14:35.740
WHAT KIND OF PARENTS
ARE YOU?

14:35.742 --> 14:39.244
THE MOVIE'S OVER.
WE FELL ASLEEP AGAIN.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.079
OH, EVERY TIME
QUEEN ELIZABETH

14:41.081 --> 14:42.614
SINGS PRESIDENT BABY
THAT LULLABY,

14:42.616 --> 14:45.183
WE'RE OUT COLD.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.784
HEY, UH, I NEED YOUR HELP.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.087
I MAY OR MAY NOT

14:49.089 --> 14:52.490
HAVE DESTROYED ONE OF LIV'S
MOST SACRED POSSESSIONS.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.392
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!
I NEED YOUR HELP UPSTAIRS!

14:56.129 --> 14:58.162
WHAT DID YOU DO?

14:58.164 --> 14:59.764
I DID THIS.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.299
Both: NO!

15:02.435 --> 15:04.535
WE HAVE TO FIX THAT
BEFORE LIV FINDS OUT.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.436
MOVE, MOVE!

15:05.438 --> 15:07.105
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

15:07.107 --> 15:08.439
MOVE!

15:14.114 --> 15:16.180
NO SIGN OF MADDIE.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.149
WAIT, PARKER, WHY ARE WE
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

15:18.151 --> 15:21.185
Parker:
<i>WE MUST HAVE TAKEN</i>
<i>A WRONG TURN SOMEWHERE.</i>

15:21.187 --> 15:23.721
ROGER THAT.
WHOOP!  OKAY.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.590
WOULD YOU MIND
BACKING UP SLIGHTLY?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.392
YOUR HEADLAMP
IS BURNING MY BUTT.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.096
"LIV, LOVE, LAUGH."

15:32.098 --> 15:34.832
HUH, I NEVER NOTICED
HOW DUMB THAT WAS.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.837
HA, OH, OH, OH!

15:39.839 --> 15:41.706
EPIC ENTRANCE!

15:41.708 --> 15:43.741
THANKS, BRO'.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.843
SWEET, HUH?
AND LIV'S RIGHT BEHIND ME,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.345
SO HIDE THE DIVA BOARD.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.582
( gasps )

15:51.584 --> 15:53.251
MADDIE'S LOST
IN THE PARKER TUNNELS.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.154
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO CHECK
THE HIGH SCHOOL NEXT.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.556
YOU HAVE TUNNELS
THAT LEAD ALL THE WAY
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.292
I HAVE SO MANY TUNNELS,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY ALL GO.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.528
OH, AND, UH...

16:03.530 --> 16:05.463
I DON'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.798
BUT WE MAY NEVER
SEE MADDIE AGAIN.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.333
WHAT?!

16:08.335 --> 16:10.435
OH, YOU GUYS,
WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.136
I FEEL SO AWFUL.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.605
WE GOT INTO THIS FIGHT.
AND I MEAN, WORDS WERE SAID,

16:14.607 --> 16:18.176
REALLY AWFUL WORDS
LIKE CLOSET, AND SPACE,

16:18.178 --> 16:20.345
AND, OH, HANGER!

16:20.347 --> 16:22.047
SHH.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.748
WE'RE ON A SEARCH
AND RESCUE MISSION.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.783
DON'T DISTRACT ME
WITH LADY TALK.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.722
GO, GO, FIND MY SISTER.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.490
BRING HER BACK SAFE.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.492
AND IF IT TAKES YOU,
LIKE, THREE TO FOUR HOURS,

16:34.494 --> 16:35.760
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.598
( Karen sighs )

16:40.600 --> 16:42.200
SO, JOEY,

16:42.202 --> 16:43.935
NOW WE CAN FIX
THE WIRING AND
THE LIGHTS,

16:43.937 --> 16:46.237
BUT THERE IS NO WAY
THAT WE CAN FIX
THE DIVA BOARD

16:46.239 --> 16:47.405
BEFORE LIV NOTICES.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.607
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT THIS.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.710
I'VE BEEN PAINTING MODEL
SPACESHIPS AND WIZARD PORTRAITS

16:52.712 --> 16:55.680
SINCE BEFORE IT WAS COOL
AND WELL AFTER IT WASN'T.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.482
WE BELIEVE IN YOU, JOEY.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.217
I REGRET THIS ALREADY.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.189
( gasps )

17:07.227 --> 17:08.659
NO SIGN OF MADDIE!

17:08.661 --> 17:10.495
I'M GETTING
REALLY SCARED, PARKER.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.230
Parker:
<i>CALM DOWN, WOMAN,</i>

17:12.232 --> 17:15.566
<i>AND TRY LOOKING FARTHER</i>
<i>THAN JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR.</i>

17:16.836 --> 17:18.903
ALL RIGHT, FINE,

17:18.905 --> 17:20.905
BUT SHE IS MY TWIN SISTER.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.540
I THINK I WOULD KNOW
IF SHE WERE HERE.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.508
- LIV.
- ( gasps )

17:23.510 --> 17:25.576
- YOU'RE HERE!
- HEY, YEAH.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.212
LISTEN, MADDIE,
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT
OUR STUPID FIGHT.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.248
UH, PUT A PIN
IN THAT APOLOGY, SIS.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.516
I HAVE UNCOVERED A RAT.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.351
OH, ME TOO.
IT ATE ALL OF OUR BREAD

17:33.353 --> 17:35.219
AND IT STILL CHASED US.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.523
NO, I AM TALKING
ABOUT A DIRTY RAT

17:38.525 --> 17:39.657
NAMED PARKER ROONEY.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.459
I DIDN'T LOSE AT
REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.494
HE CHEATED.
LOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND
IN THE TUNNELS.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.297
IT'S A RECIPE
FOR FAKE MOLDY FISH.

17:46.299 --> 17:50.234
"GROUND BEEF,
CHOCOLATE TAFFY,
DRIED SEAWEED."

17:50.236 --> 17:53.538
HE LITERALLY COULDN'T
REMEMBER THREE INGREDIENTS?

17:53.540 --> 17:56.641
I THINK IT'S TIME

17:56.643 --> 17:58.376
THAT PARKER
LEARN A LESSON,

17:58.378 --> 17:59.744
AND NOT JUST
ANY ORDINARY LESSON.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.612
I THINK WE NEED
TO REACH DOWN

18:01.614 --> 18:03.481
INTO HIS TORTURED PAST

18:03.483 --> 18:04.916
AND BRING OUT
THE BIG GUNS.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.284
YOU MEAN
THE DARK LORD HIMSELF?

18:06.286 --> 18:07.785
AYE, LASSIE.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.587
Both:
THE GOOMERY-GOO!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.422
- HA HA!
- ( giggles )

18:14.994 --> 18:16.828
ALL RIGHT.
LIGHTS ARE FIXED.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.396
SHOULD WE GO SEE
IF JOEY'S FINISHED

18:18.398 --> 18:19.497
PAINTING LIV'S HEADBOARD?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.999
OR YOU COULD TAKE
A DIVA MOMENT.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.635
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.840
OKAY, HIT IT.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.543
( vocalizing )

18:34.347 --> 18:38.316
♪ WE ARE AWESOME PARENTS. ♪

18:38.318 --> 18:40.818
- WHOO!
- NICE PIPES,
KARE-BEAR.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.287
Joey:
<i>HEY, GUYS, I'VE REALLY</i>
<i>OUTDONE MYSELF</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:44.989
<i>WITH THIS DIVA BOARD.</i>

18:49.329 --> 18:50.695
WHAT IS THAT?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.029
I CALL IT,

18:52.031 --> 18:53.998
"JOSEPH TRIUMPHANT."

18:56.002 --> 18:57.935
YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO RECREATE

18:57.937 --> 18:59.337
LIV'S DIVA BOARD EXACTLY,

18:59.339 --> 19:01.706
NOT DO
WHATEVER THIS IS.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.542
I KNOW.
I KNOW,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.010
BUT MY BRUSH JUST
STARTED MOVING.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.613
AND I LET IT GO
WHEREVER IT WANTED TO GO.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.916
IT'S ME TAKING
THE KITTY BY THE EARS.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.951
IT'S HOW I HANDLE
ALL MY BUSINESS.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.021
WELL, YOU HANDLE
YOUR BUSINESS WRONG.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.823
OKAY?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.092
SO NOW WE HAVE TO GET
PAINTS, CANVASS, AND BRUSHES

19:21.094 --> 19:23.528
- TO FIX THIS.
- DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.596
NO, NO,
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.035
I DON'T GET IT.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.337
WE'VE CHECKED ALL
THE SECTORS AND QUADRANTS.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.839
THINK, PARKER!  THINK.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.357
YOU MADE THESE TUNNELS,
YEAH?

19:36.358 --> 19:37.874
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
THAT YOU'VE JUST MISSED.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.714
LOOK, THERE'S MOVEMENT
IN TUNNEL NUMBER FIVE!

19:43.716 --> 19:45.016
OH, THAT MUST BE MADDIE!

19:46.719 --> 19:49.053
BUT WHAT'S THAT
OTHER DOT BEHIND HER?

19:50.657 --> 19:51.989
( giggles )

19:51.991 --> 19:53.491
IT'S LIKE REALLY NOT FAIR

19:53.493 --> 19:55.526
TO PIT A 10-YEAR-OLD
AGAINST A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS

19:55.528 --> 19:56.727
IN A PRANK WAR.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.029
BUT, I MEAN,
HE STARTED THIS GAME

19:58.031 --> 20:00.464
AND I'M GONNA FINISH IT,
SO LIKE ACTION!

20:01.901 --> 20:04.835
IS IT A RACCOON OR MAYBE
IT'S A-- LIKE A POSSUM?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.737
OR--
( exaggerated gasping )

20:06.739 --> 20:08.639
( in Scottish accent )
THE GOOMERY-GOO!

20:09.742 --> 20:11.876
OR ME RUNNING DOWN A TUNNEL

20:11.878 --> 20:13.044
DRAGGING A HOT
ROASTED TURKEY

20:13.046 --> 20:15.479
TO CREATE
A SECOND HEAT SOURCE.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.115
LIV, YOU MIGHT HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO FOOL ME

20:18.117 --> 20:21.018
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID,
BUT I'M A MAN OF SCIENCE NOW.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.987
I DON'T BELIEVE IN
THE GOOMERY-GOO.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.891
OKAY, THEN, UM,
TELL ME, MAN OF SCIENCE,

20:26.893 --> 20:28.993
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT
SECOND HEAT SOURCE

20:28.995 --> 20:30.528
CHASING THE FIRST
HEAT SOURCE?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.029
HAVE YOUR SENSORS
MALFUNCTIONED

20:32.031 --> 20:34.665
OR HAVE YOUR
NIGHTMARES COME TRUE?

20:35.835 --> 20:38.436
EITHER WAY, YOU OWE ME
FIVE YEARS OF HALLOWEEN CANDY

20:38.438 --> 20:39.604
AND A PIG FULL OF PENNIES.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.038
TO THE BEANBAG!

20:44.444 --> 20:46.711
- <i> ( baby cries )</i>
- ( laughs )

20:46.713 --> 20:47.979
CLASSIC.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.847
PRESIDENT BABY JUST MADE
A BOOM BOOM

20:49.849 --> 20:52.049
IN THE WAR ROOM.  UH.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.653
OH, PARKER, GET OUT
OF THOSE TUNNELS!

20:55.655 --> 20:57.154
I THINK I HEARD
SOMETHING CHASING US.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.823
AND I THINK IT WAS
THE GOOMERY-GOO.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.961
LIV, STOP,
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS THE GOOMERY-GOO.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.097
- <i> ( roars )</i>
- OH, PARKER!

21:06.099 --> 21:07.999
SOMETHING'S GOT MY FOOT!

21:08.001 --> 21:09.133
JOEY, HELP ME!

21:09.135 --> 21:11.068
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.703
IT'S THE GOOMERY-GOO!
HE'S REAL!

21:12.705 --> 21:14.038
AND HE'S GOT MY FOOT!

21:14.040 --> 21:15.006
<i>( roars )</i>

21:15.008 --> 21:17.108
( shrieks )

21:17.110 --> 21:18.393
<i>( roaring continues )</i>

21:18.394 --> 21:19.677
CLOSE IT UP.
SEAL THE TUNNEL.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.813
- ( roars )
- ( screams )

21:23.750 --> 21:25.116
BAM! WHAT?!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.886
WAIT, MADDIE?

21:28.888 --> 21:29.920
HA!

21:29.922 --> 21:31.272
THAT IS WHAT YOU GET

21:31.273 --> 21:32.623
FOR CHEATING US IN
REFRIGERATOR ROULETTE.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.960
WELL, ON THE UPSIDE,

21:35.962 --> 21:37.628
I GOT ANOTHER PAIR
OF DIRTY UNDERWEAR

21:37.630 --> 21:38.963
TO HANG ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.570
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
DID DO A GOOD JOB,

21:46.572 --> 21:48.639
BUT I STILL THINK THAT
"JOSEPH TRIUMPHANT"

21:48.641 --> 21:52.510
WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ROOM
A MUCH NEEDED DOSE OF AWESOME.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.046
YEAH, JOEY,
THERE WAS NOTHING TRIUMPHANT
ABOUT THAT PAINTING.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.548
GO AHEAD, LIV,
TAKE YOUR MOMENT.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.115
( giggles )

21:59.152 --> 22:00.584
( clears throat )

22:00.586 --> 22:01.752
( inhales deeply )

22:01.754 --> 22:03.621
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH ♪

22:03.623 --> 22:06.157
♪ OOH, YEAH ♪

22:06.159 --> 22:09.627
♪ KEEP YOUR PAWS
OFF MY STUFF, JOEY ♪

22:09.629 --> 22:10.695
♪ OOH. ♪

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
AND SINCE
PARKER AND I CHEATED,

22:16.002 --> 22:18.102
OUR CLOSET IS ALL YOURS.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.538
IT WAS HARD TO SCRAPE OFF
ALL THE DRIED MASHED POTATOES,

22:20.540 --> 22:21.872
BUT WE DID IT.

22:21.874 --> 22:25.009
...ISH.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.644
ACTUALLY,
THERE'S NO NEED, JOEY.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.145
UM, THANKS TO
THE PARKER TUNNELS

22:28.147 --> 22:29.246
AND OUR NEW SHOE ELEVATOR,

22:29.248 --> 22:30.648
WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.817
I JUST ENTER THE KIND
OF SHOE THAT I WANT

22:32.819 --> 22:35.052
- AND...
- <i> ( bell dings )</i>

22:37.724 --> 22:39.090
AH!

22:42.662 --> 22:44.995
HELLO,
SPARKLY RED WEDGE
NUMBER 26.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.164
( inhales deeply, sighs )

22:50.770 --> 22:52.636
( sighs )

22:58.010 --> 22:59.493
YOU KNOW, I'M KINDA GLAD

22:59.494 --> 23:00.977
WE WERE FINALLY FORCED
TO CLEAN THIS DUMP.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.147
LET'S NEVER
LET THE BRO' CAVE

23:03.149 --> 23:04.548
GET DIRTY AGAIN.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.751
NEVER AGAIN.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.258
( slithers )
