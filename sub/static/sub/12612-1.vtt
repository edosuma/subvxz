00:17.785 --> 00:20.352
[church bell rings]

00:28.996 --> 00:32.765
[howling]

00:42.743 --> 00:45.544
[wind blowing]

01:08.702 --> 01:14.073
[heavy breathing]

01:23.517 --> 01:28.854
[ominous whispers]

01:56.717 --> 02:01.854
[haunting music]

02:30.351 --> 02:35.120
[discord and snarling]

02:35.122 --> 02:39.658
[demonic laughter]

02:54.642 --> 02:59.845
[thundering heartbeat]

03:05.452 --> 03:06.885
[gasp]

03:45.159 --> 03:47.726
[alarm]

03:58.339 --> 04:03.475
[funereal choral music]

04:05.746 --> 04:09.948
[wheel creaks]

05:37.438 --> 05:41.873
[distant traffic]

06:27.187 --> 06:31.022
So you, uh, left
the door open again.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.991
Cash is on the counter.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.764
You know, as much as I
love being your personal maid

06:38.766 --> 06:41.867
and running all these
little errands for you,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.536
you really need to get out
of this apartment, buddy.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.238
This is...

06:46.240 --> 06:47.739
It's gettin' ridiculous.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.875
I just have a couple more
paintings to finish up.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.276
But thank you for your help.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.078
No problem.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.884
Hey, I'm goin'
over to McGowan's.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.285
Craig's got his
birthday happening.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.720
You should come with.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.355
I don't like karaoke.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.525
It's not karaoke.
It's drunk girls singing.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.027
So it's drunk girl-araoke,
which is awesome.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.729
Everybody loves
drunk girl-araoke.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.464
You should come, get
out of your apartment.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.933
- It smells like a shoe.
- Oh.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.470
No, I'm fine.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.674
[Nathan] Okay.

07:23.944 --> 07:28.914
[discord and snarling]

07:28.916 --> 07:30.282
[gasp]

07:38.792 --> 07:41.092
[woman] Sleep paralysis.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.628
It's happening
every morning now?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.964
Only when I have the dream.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.632
But it's happened
two nights in a row.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.235
It hasn't happened that
close together before.

07:50.237 --> 07:54.473
The Sleeping Beauty dream?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.774
It always ends the same way.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.843
I'm about to kiss her,

07:57.845 --> 08:00.145
then get distracted by
some creepy-looking house

08:00.147 --> 08:02.814
and that's it.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.084
Are they connected, the sleep
paralysis and the dream?

08:06.086 --> 08:09.287
What do you think?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.022
I did some reading
on sleep paralysis

08:11.024 --> 08:13.091
and it's supposedly your
body not moving smoothly

08:13.093 --> 08:14.993
through the stages of sleep.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.829
And I also read that
in the Dark Ages

08:17.831 --> 08:21.166
people thought the paralysis
was a demon or evil spirit

08:21.168 --> 08:23.502
sitting on your chest.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.608
You mentioned that I'm your
third therapist in three years.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.943
So you already know what I'm
gonna say about the dream.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.813
Your subconscious created
this perfect, passive woman

08:34.815 --> 08:37.716
with whom you are
unable to connect.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.950
Can you see the parallels here

08:38.952 --> 08:41.653
with your isolation with people?

08:41.655 --> 08:45.023
That is the distraction keeping
you from your real life.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.026
Your lack of human interaction
is what makes these sessions

08:48.028 --> 08:50.862
the wrong kind of necessity.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.831
You're looking for an
answer you already know.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.000
You just won't accept.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.503
What you need is to put
yourself out there again.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.239
Be vulnerable. Only then do
I think this dream will fade

09:01.241 --> 09:04.609
and you won't depend
on this so much.

09:24.598 --> 09:28.400
[rustling]

09:30.737 --> 09:34.339
[cell phone ringing]

09:40.547 --> 09:42.047
Hello?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.548
[woman]
<i>Is this Thomas Kaiser?</i>

09:43.550 --> 09:45.750
- Yes. Who is this?
<i>- Hi, this is Katherine</i>

09:45.752 --> 09:47.786
<i>from the law office of
Jeff Jennings and Associates.</i>

09:47.788 --> 09:50.956
<i>Can you come down to
claim your inheritance?</i>

09:50.958 --> 09:52.090
What?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.426
[indistinct conversations]

09:54.428 --> 09:55.760
[Katherine] Uh-huh.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.963
Yep.
[snaps fingers]

09:57.965 --> 10:00.632
Yeah.
Talk to you later, bye.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.034
Where is this?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.270
The address is at the top.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.372
- It's like three hours from here.
- You know what?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.940
I really know just
about as much as you do.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.742
This firm is just the
executor of the property.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.279
Wait. You said Clive Kaiser died
and left this property to me?

10:14.281 --> 10:17.248
Yes. It says here that
you are the beneficiary.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.818
I had to dig in the archives
downstairs for this.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.320
It looks like the property's been
in your family for generations.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.556
It doesn't make any sense.
I've never met my uncle...

10:24.558 --> 10:27.325
Okay, you're breaking my heart.
This came in a few days ago.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.994
It's from your uncle Clive

10:28.996 --> 10:31.563
and the envelope said
that it should go to you

10:31.565 --> 10:33.932
along with the deed.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.500
How much is the
property worth?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.969
It's never been sold,
so there's no reference.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.406
You'll have to get it appraised.
We can help you with that, for a fee.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.843
But you know what? You might want to go
out there and check it out on your own.

10:44.845 --> 10:50.148
[whispers and hissing]

10:51.985 --> 10:56.321
- You okay?
- How did he die?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.024
Oh, it says here
that his body was found

10:59.026 --> 11:02.160
in the river by the property.
It was ruled suicide.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.530
Thanks.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.365
I'll have a real estate
associate meet you out there.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.800
[door slams]

11:08.802 --> 11:10.769
'Cause I am not drivin'
out to that place.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.772
[sigh]
That was stimulating.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.661
[Clive] <i> Thomas, I</i>
<i>wish we had a chance</i>

11:36.663 --> 11:38.396
<i>to get to know each other.</i>

11:38.398 --> 11:41.199
<i>Your grandmother, my
mother, did her best</i>

11:41.201 --> 11:44.069
<i>to make sure that
we had never met.</i>

11:44.071 --> 11:46.571
<i>She was not
without her reasons.</i>

11:46.573 --> 11:51.242
<i>The men in our family carry
with us something terrible.</i>

11:51.244 --> 11:55.413
<i>Kaiser Gardens has been in our
family for a very long time.</i>

11:55.415 --> 11:59.417
<i>I have held watch for
over four decades.</i>

11:59.419 --> 12:03.354
<i>I cannot withstand the burden
of this property anymore.</i>

12:03.356 --> 12:06.958
<i>I entrust
Kaiser Gardens to you.</i>

12:08.762 --> 12:10.995
Oh, hey man. I brought the...
Where are you going?

12:10.997 --> 12:12.097
I'm just gonna
check something out.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.665
I'll be back soon though.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.400
But I got you the stuff
that you were asking...

12:15.402 --> 12:16.868
- Just leave it on the counter.
- What about your paintings?

12:16.870 --> 12:20.071
[Thomas] Uh, watch
over 'em for me?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.841
Watch over your paintings?

12:22.843 --> 12:23.908
[door closes]

12:23.910 --> 12:26.411
What, are we dating?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.464
[Clive] <i> When you</i>
<i>reach Kaiser Gardens,</i>

12:46.466 --> 12:48.633
<i>there are rules you must obey.</i>

12:48.635 --> 12:53.371
<i>Your bloodline is able to access
all parts of the property,</i>

12:53.373 --> 12:55.807
<i>but you must never
enter the hidden rooms</i>

12:55.809 --> 12:57.742
<i>below the basement.</i>

12:57.744 --> 13:02.046
<i>Trust me when I say they
are sealed for a reason,</i>

13:02.048 --> 13:04.749
<i>along with
any objects protected</i>

13:04.751 --> 13:07.385
<i>against the hands of outsiders.</i>

13:07.387 --> 13:09.621
<i>I wish you well.</i>

13:09.623 --> 13:11.990
<i>And I ask for your forgiveness.</i>

13:11.992 --> 13:14.759
<i>It is a curse...</i>

13:14.761 --> 13:18.129
<i>...and a blessing.</i>

13:18.131 --> 13:21.466
<i>May the spirits
be on your side.</i>

13:48.695 --> 13:53.264
[whispers]

14:13.553 --> 14:18.857
[heavy breathing]

15:12.946 --> 15:14.746
[crunch]

15:14.748 --> 15:19.918
[door creaks]

16:17.510 --> 16:19.210

16:23.083 --> 16:24.349

[rapid breathing]

18:28.975 --> 18:30.475
Hey.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.710
Ah, shit.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.412
I'm so sorry. Thomas.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.448
- Yeah.
- Yeah, hi, I'm...

18:37.450 --> 18:39.383
Hi, I'm sorry.
I'm Linda Coleman.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.952
We spoke over the phone.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.286
- I'm so sorry. I wasn't quite...
- [Thomas] It's okay.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.721
I kinda spooked myself out.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.290
Yeah, I don't blame you.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.294
[light buzzes]

18:53.633 --> 18:56.734
Ah, this place is a shit hole.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.972
Um, here. I'll give you
the keys to the house.

19:00.974 --> 19:05.109
And your keys to the front door.
You just, um...

19:05.111 --> 19:07.345
Well, you open the door the
old-fashioned way. You just turn it.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.180
So much for the thrill
of breaking and entering.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.782
And I have an appraiser
going to come by

19:11.784 --> 19:15.153
this week to get a ballpark
estimate of this property.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.691
- Sorry for your loss.
- Did you know my uncle?

19:20.693 --> 19:23.828
No, not personally. No.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.430
No, he was more of a shut-in.
Were you close?

19:26.432 --> 19:29.567
I didn't know anything about
him until a couple days ago.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.504
Well that's weird.
He just...

19:33.506 --> 19:35.806
He just gave you this
property just like that?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.375
That's very weird.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.943
Based on his letter to me
he was more than just weird.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.679
He was bat shit crazy.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.449
[laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.786
Um, these mannequins,

19:48.788 --> 19:52.957
and his artwork would
definitely qualify him.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.696
Um, I'm sorry. Do you have
a letter from your uncle?

19:58.698 --> 20:02.066
You talked about that.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.202
The lawyer handed it
to me with the deed.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.871
Would you mind if
I take a look at it?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.774
It's actually in my car.
Why?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.812
I'm so sorry. [laughs]

20:14.814 --> 20:16.714
You must be so tired.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.015
It was very nice to
meet you, Thomas.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.585
Have a nice day. Bye.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.996
[Thomas scoffs]

20:34.867 --> 20:39.103
[deep sigh]

21:55.081 --> 21:56.914
Thomas.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.688
I always woke up before.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.161
This can't be a dream.
It's too real.

22:11.197 --> 22:14.098
This realm is like a dream.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.701
One where we can both dwell.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.205
You're in my head.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.541
As you are in mine.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.781
I am also close to you
in the physical world.

22:30.783 --> 22:34.352
That is the reason I am awake.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.721
Sleeping Beauty.

22:37.623 --> 22:41.025
It's what I called you before.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.694
Briar Rose is my given name.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.796
I like that.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.165
When you said you're close to me

22:48.167 --> 22:50.634
in the physical world,
what do you mean?

22:52.004 --> 22:55.206
So I'm still asleep,

22:55.208 --> 22:57.475
awaiting your kiss.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.391
[snarling]

23:13.393 --> 23:18.729
[panicked breathing]

23:20.500 --> 23:23.167
Thomas, don't go.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.602
Rose!

23:24.604 --> 23:27.772
[pounding heartbeat]

23:30.276 --> 23:35.579
[door creaks]

23:36.349 --> 23:41.619
[hissing and rattling]

23:53.232 --> 23:57.134
[low roar]

23:57.136 --> 23:58.969
[Thomas gasps]

24:09.115 --> 24:11.649
Pipes are old and gonna
need to be replaced.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.784
Interior paint is decent.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.786
Outside could use a coat.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.254
Sounds expensive.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.557
Not very well maintained.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.295
Did you find anything
weird inside the house?

24:24.297 --> 24:26.163
You're kiddin' me, right?

24:26.165 --> 24:29.900
I mean in terms
of, like, vibes.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.471
Are you asking me if I
think this house is haunted?

24:34.307 --> 24:37.074
Yes.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.343
Quite a few folks have
gone missing over the years

24:39.345 --> 24:40.911
but the police have
searched this house

24:40.913 --> 24:43.681
a bunch of times and
never found any evidence.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.517
Fingers have always pointed
right back to this house.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.686
It didn't help your
uncle's popularity any.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.622
It's probably why he didn't
leave the house that much.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.190
Do you think it will
affect the asking price?

24:53.192 --> 24:57.761
[scoffs] Yep, especially
if the buyer's local.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.431
Now I suggest you get the
electrical fixed first

25:00.433 --> 25:02.199
before we do the final estimate.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.436
Here, I can give you this card for
the best electrician in town.

25:05.438 --> 25:08.005
He's the only
electrician in town.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.641
- Thanks.
- I can come back day after tomorrow.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.344
We can sit down, look at the wiring,
and see what needs to be done

25:13.346 --> 25:14.678
without breaking the bank.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.647
I'd appreciate that very much.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.782
Oh, the basement.
I think there's more to it.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.985
- What do you mean?
- Well it's not on the blueprints

25:20.987 --> 25:22.653
and whoever did the wall
did a pretty good job,

25:22.655 --> 25:24.655
but I've doing this
job long enough to know

25:24.657 --> 25:27.124
when there's extra
square feet hidden away.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.569
[engine starts]

25:52.184 --> 25:55.085
[lights buzz]

26:26.619 --> 26:28.018
[click]

27:03.990 --> 27:06.790
[faint whispering]

27:32.318 --> 27:37.254
[indistinct conversation]

27:43.462 --> 27:45.429
Excuse me. Hi.

27:45.431 --> 27:49.099
I need to look at
some property records.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.335
You're gonna have to be a
bit more specific than that.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.103
Uh, I just inherited a house

27:53.105 --> 27:55.372
so I need to check some
records for an appraisal.

27:55.374 --> 27:59.343
- Address?
- 1542 Chanley Street.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.380
It's Kaiser Gardens.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.449
Oh.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.193
[sigh]

30:00.232 --> 30:01.932
[eerie whispers]

30:01.934 --> 30:05.269
[stomach gurgling]

30:05.271 --> 30:08.005
[Thomas gasps]

30:08.007 --> 30:12.476
[hissing and rattling]

30:53.285 --> 30:55.953
[Linda] Hi.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.487
I'm sorry to show up
unannounced like this.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.790
I have something I need
to speak to you about.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.125
Yeah, that's okay.

31:02.127 --> 31:04.761
You don't look so good.
Are you okay?

31:06.332 --> 31:07.931
I'll be fine.

31:09.802 --> 31:12.836
I stopped by the county
clerk's office today.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.572
What did you find out?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.840
That the house has
been in my family

31:16.842 --> 31:19.710
since before they kept records.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.947
Earliest name on the
deed is from 1876. Jacob Kaiser.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.583
That's interesting.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.322
Do you have any information
you want to add on to that?

31:32.324 --> 31:33.690
I don't know what
you're getting at.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.158
I think you do.

31:38.764 --> 31:42.165
There was a note in the file

31:42.167 --> 31:44.167
and the handwriting
matches your handwriting

31:44.169 --> 31:46.270
from Billings's appraisal.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.272
Well I don't like
being ambushed.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.574
What is it about the property
that you're so interested in?

31:50.576 --> 31:52.276
[Linda] Okay.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.745
Please.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.581
Answer me.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.618
My brother died in that house.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.888
So whatever sick, twisted thing you people
have going on, I'm gonna figure it out.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.290
I told you I only
found that out...

32:06.292 --> 32:07.591
Well, you must know something.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.193
At this point you
know more than I do.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.564
My brother wasn't
the only one.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.034
Fifty-three people have gone
missing from that property

32:17.036 --> 32:18.468
in the last 125 years.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.903
The appraiser said the
cops searched the place

32:19.905 --> 32:21.705
top to bottom.
They found nothing.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.774
Yeah, well that's what this
town keeps on telling itself.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.709
You think my uncle did it?

32:26.779 --> 32:29.313
I think it's something worse.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.883
You think it's haunted.

32:32.885 --> 32:34.451
You don't?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.586
I don't care.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.622
I wanna sell it
and get the hell out

32:38.624 --> 32:40.590
of this godforsaken town.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.826
Well I'm gonna
find my answers.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.761
And if you end up being
one of those answers,

32:44.763 --> 32:45.963
so help me God.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.097
[gurgling]

32:47.099 --> 32:48.665
[Thomas gasps]

32:48.667 --> 32:51.101
Thomas? Thomas, Thomas?

32:51.103 --> 32:52.102
Thomas, wake up.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.236
[gurgling]

32:53.238 --> 32:54.304
Thomas can you hear me?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.605
Help!

32:55.607 --> 32:56.606
Thomas.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.841
Thomas, wake up.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.343
Thomas can you hear me?

32:59.345 --> 33:01.778
Help! Somebody! Thomas!

33:01.780 --> 33:04.815
[snarling]

33:04.817 --> 33:06.750
What's wrong with him?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.452
Panic attack.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.488
I gave him something
to calm him down.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.227
[woman] <i> Come to me.</i>

33:29.274 --> 33:31.441
You're back.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.844
Only in my dreams.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.314
This realm is yours
as much as it is mine.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.950
What about in waking life?

33:41.220 --> 33:43.987
You will be the
one to set me free.

33:43.989 --> 33:47.290
You are lord of the land
which I am cursed to.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.161
You may be mortal, Thomas,

33:51.163 --> 33:54.297
but in the physical realm
you have great power.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.868
The Veiled Demon knows this.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.303
The Veiled Demon?
Is that what I saw yesterday?

34:00.305 --> 34:03.774
She is merely an
intruder on your domain.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.677
She is what made me flee.

34:07.679 --> 34:11.982
Until her curse is lifted,
we can't truly be together.

34:11.984 --> 34:15.418
And to lift the curse,
I need to what? Defeat her?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.688
You are the heir apparent
of the Kaiser bloodline.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.223
Only you can wake me.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.092
[whispers]

34:23.094 --> 34:28.098
You are away from me,
away from your land.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.666
Yeah.

34:29.668 --> 34:34.004
When you are separated
from me, your body withers.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.474
It is the same curse
that imprisons me.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.679
The curse is real, Thomas.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.014
You are in Kaiser Gardens?

34:45.016 --> 34:47.384
Remember the bloodline
will awaken me,

34:47.386 --> 34:50.152
and open all doors.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.257
You must wake up now.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.109
Hi.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.810
I, uh...

35:13.812 --> 35:16.213
...brought you some food.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.781
What time is it?

35:17.783 --> 35:20.317
Last I checked, five p.m.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.524
[Thomas sighs]

35:43.075 --> 35:44.641
Here.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.016
What happened?

35:53.018 --> 35:56.486
Um, well,
you passed out at the bar

35:56.488 --> 35:58.321
and then I took you
to the hospital.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.290
The doctor said there was nothing
wrong with you, physically,

36:00.292 --> 36:01.658
and then you started screaming

36:01.660 --> 36:04.127
that you needed to
be taken back here.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.664
You were fine once you
got back to the house.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.101
- Shit.
- Yeah.

36:11.103 --> 36:14.538
Um, did you ever figure out
what happened to the lights?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.540
They work on and off.

36:16.542 --> 36:20.343
Especially at night, everything
seems to stop working.

36:24.216 --> 36:26.049
My files.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.223
Why you helping me now?

36:33.225 --> 36:35.992
Mutual interest.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.827
You seem to be stuck
with this place

36:37.829 --> 36:41.431
and I want to find my brother.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.935
You think he's here?

36:46.672 --> 36:51.107
I was living in Oregon
when I got the phone call.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.378
It was hell on my parents

36:55.380 --> 36:58.715
but we spent months searching,

36:58.717 --> 37:02.085
which is why I came here.

37:02.087 --> 37:08.458
I was a realtor in Portland so I figured
it was my way onto the property.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.931
His name is Luke.

37:14.933 --> 37:20.170
He was supposedly
with his girlfriend.

37:20.172 --> 37:23.940
A witness said he saw
him walking this way.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.043
<i>They were out
one drunken night.</i>

37:27.045 --> 37:30.347
<i>They must have come to
the house on a dare.</i>

37:33.118 --> 37:34.551
[muffled scream]

37:34.553 --> 37:37.420
That was the last
time he was seen.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.790
I am completely obsessed
with this place.

37:40.792 --> 37:44.427
Every few years another
person goes missing.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.230
Thomas, you said last night that

37:47.232 --> 37:49.232
Jacob Kaiser is the oldest
holder of this property.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.101
Well two generations
later, Michael Kaiser

37:51.103 --> 37:52.869
was the owner of this property.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.105
Earlier 1900s he tried to burn
this place into the ground.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.373
He died a few days later.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.774
Body just shut down.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.444
From what I could figure out

38:01.446 --> 38:03.880
with your family on this side,

38:03.882 --> 38:05.815
is that it's all pretty
much the same story.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.218
Accidental deaths, suicides.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.153
Males, shut-ins.

38:11.490 --> 38:17.327
I believe that it has
to do with this house.

38:19.831 --> 38:25.368
Some sort of
supernatural connection.

38:27.105 --> 38:31.875
Let's say I'm stuck in
this mansion until I die.

38:33.312 --> 38:36.079
There has to be a way
to break the spell,

38:36.081 --> 38:37.480
or curse, or whatever.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.649
You think it's a curse?

38:39.651 --> 38:42.352
I'm entertaining
the possibility.

38:42.354 --> 38:47.657
But cops, us, have searched
the house top to bottom.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.960
That's why I wanted to
see your uncle's letter.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.362
There has to be something there

38:52.364 --> 38:55.699
that connects your
family's bloodline.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.567
Bloodline.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.538
- Thomas?
- Come on.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.908
Follow me.
I have the letter.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.846
Be careful.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.919
This is it.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.326
[Linda] Whoa.

39:23.328 --> 39:25.161
Yeah.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.996
So Billings was certain
there was more space

39:26.998 --> 39:29.666
behind this wall.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.235
And your uncle also
says here that there are

39:32.237 --> 39:34.904
more rooms below the basement.

39:36.208 --> 39:40.076
Here.
[grunts]

39:40.078 --> 39:42.045
Yeah, I tried that.
It doesn't move.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.119
[Linda] Hey, is that blood?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.256
That's what I thought.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.232
Bloodline.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.467
[distant rumble]

40:15.414 --> 40:19.749
[whirring]

40:19.751 --> 40:21.117
[thud]

40:21.586 --> 40:25.054
Holy shit.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.923
Yeah.

40:58.490 --> 41:02.559
- Looks like there's a tunnel.
- Maybe.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.395
Look at this.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.705
It's a journal.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.244
What are you doing?

41:21.246 --> 41:22.645
In his letter Clive
said the seals are meant

41:22.647 --> 41:24.747
to keep people out.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.216
You.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.023
Where's my uncle's letter?

41:37.963 --> 41:40.630
The handwriting matches, but I
don't understand what it says.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.199
Neither do I. I have no idea
what language this is.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.568
[metal clanking]

41:46.304 --> 41:48.371
What was that?

41:57.315 --> 41:59.015
- [thud]
- [Thomas gasps]

41:59.017 --> 42:01.117
- [thud]
- Come on.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.952
Let's go.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.495
[low growl]

42:12.497 --> 42:15.598
- Did you see that?
- No.

42:17.335 --> 42:18.701
[hissing]

42:18.703 --> 42:19.869
Thomas.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.971
Thomas, Thomas.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.945
[Linda screams]

42:40.692 --> 42:42.625
Oh, shit!

42:44.229 --> 42:48.131
- Looks like we have to go through them.
- Slowly.

42:56.508 --> 43:00.843
[screaming]

43:06.785 --> 43:11.220
[joints cracking]

43:11.222 --> 43:12.922
Did you just see that?

43:12.924 --> 43:14.257
Yeah, it's like it
didn't want to hurt me.

43:14.259 --> 43:17.393
- [thud]
- There. Come on!

43:17.395 --> 43:19.963
[panting]

43:19.965 --> 43:22.165
Okay, go. Go.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.070
What the hell was that?

43:27.072 --> 43:29.172
I don't know. Hold this.

43:30.275 --> 43:33.309
I don't see any more.

43:33.311 --> 43:35.979
- Give me the book.
- Okay.

44:15.453 --> 44:17.020
Linda.

44:44.983 --> 44:48.017
[growling and snarling]

44:55.226 --> 44:56.826
- Do you still have the journal?
- Yes.

44:56.828 --> 44:59.629
- Where are the keys?
- Oh, shit!

44:59.631 --> 45:00.897
[car honks]

45:00.899 --> 45:01.964
Richard.

45:01.966 --> 45:03.800
[Richard] Get in.

45:12.010 --> 45:14.310
- [Linda] Go!
- [Richard] All right, where?

45:14.312 --> 45:17.180
[demonic cackling]

45:17.182 --> 45:19.549
This is an unexpected way
to meet you officially.

45:19.551 --> 45:22.518
I tried calling you on the
cell phone, but no luck,

45:22.520 --> 45:25.054
so I decided to take a
look at that property

45:25.056 --> 45:28.558
that you've been yammering on
about for the last few months.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.059
Excellent timing, Richard.

45:30.061 --> 45:33.830
Something else
you want to tell me?

45:33.832 --> 45:37.834
- [Linda sighs]
- Listen, uh, sorry.

45:37.836 --> 45:40.369
Richard Meyers.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

45:40.371 --> 45:42.238
[Linda] Richard is an expert in
supernatural phenomenons,

45:42.240 --> 45:45.274
- specifically demonic.
- Well, paranormal cleric.

45:45.276 --> 45:48.578
I perform rituals sanctified
by the Paranormal Community,

45:48.580 --> 45:51.280
Catholic Church, to name a few.

45:51.282 --> 45:52.582
Great.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.284
So what were you running from?

45:55.286 --> 45:57.587
Something Thomas did not
believe in five minutes ago.

45:57.589 --> 45:59.589
Come on, let's go to my place.
I'll explain it to you there.

45:59.591 --> 46:01.424
All right.

46:20.278 --> 46:23.913
Well, welcome to my place.

46:23.915 --> 46:27.016
There is something that
I want to show you guys.

46:32.757 --> 46:35.825
- You took all of these?
- Yep.

46:35.827 --> 46:38.060
I've been documenting
the paranormal activity

46:38.062 --> 46:40.263
surrounding the Kaiser Gardens.

46:40.265 --> 46:43.633
I figured out that if you
use a very powerful lens

46:43.635 --> 46:45.468
and you open the shutter
for a really long time

46:45.470 --> 46:49.238
that you can pick up on that.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.074
[Richard]
See these, these spirits,

46:52.076 --> 46:56.145
some people call them
demons or ghosts or djinns

46:56.147 --> 46:58.314
but they are everywhere.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.649
Djinns?

46:59.651 --> 47:02.118
Well, there are
three kinds of beings.

47:02.120 --> 47:05.421
There are the angels that
are created by light.

47:05.423 --> 47:07.490
Humans are created by clay.

47:07.492 --> 47:11.694
And djinns are created by fire.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.863
- Like right there.
- Yes.

47:13.865 --> 47:15.598
[Thomas] So that thing we
saw in the house,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.266
the dark figure
moving in and out?

47:17.268 --> 47:19.168
[Richard]
Most likely that was a djinn.

47:19.170 --> 47:24.373
They mostly appear as a
shadow or as a black dog.

47:24.375 --> 47:27.143
They can be evil, or good.

47:27.145 --> 47:30.479
And they can take
possession of many things,

47:30.481 --> 47:33.015
such as inanimate objects.

47:33.017 --> 47:37.854
But like angels, they exist
in a supernatural realm,

47:37.856 --> 47:41.757
and like humans
they have free will.

47:43.828 --> 47:45.828
Free will.

47:45.830 --> 47:48.831
So they're behind what's
happening at the house?

47:48.833 --> 47:51.200
And I'm stuck with them?

47:51.202 --> 47:53.002
I hate this goddamn house.

47:53.004 --> 47:55.071
I don't blame you.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.909
At least we know what
we're dealing with.

47:59.911 --> 48:01.644
It doesn't matter.

48:01.646 --> 48:02.845
Nothing does.

48:02.847 --> 48:04.313
My life is over.
Don't you get it?

48:04.315 --> 48:05.982
What are you talkin' about?

48:05.984 --> 48:08.251
Richard, he gets a sickness.

48:08.253 --> 48:10.152
We think if he spends
more than a few days

48:10.154 --> 48:13.489
away from the
property, he'll die.

48:13.491 --> 48:17.593
So you're cosmically
bound to the property?

48:17.595 --> 48:20.863
[laughs] That's interesting.

48:20.865 --> 48:23.232
You know, I've heard
about this before

48:23.234 --> 48:24.734
but I've never actually seen it.

48:24.736 --> 48:26.836
This is exciting.

48:28.273 --> 48:29.572
You...

48:31.042 --> 48:33.910
May I please borrow the
keys to your car, Richard?

48:33.912 --> 48:37.980
Oh, well, it needs gas.

48:51.629 --> 48:55.097
Thanks a lot, Uncle Clive.

48:55.867 --> 48:57.800
Shit!

49:28.066 --> 49:29.565
I'm not tied to the property.

49:29.567 --> 49:31.901
I'm tied to her, Briar Rose.

49:31.903 --> 49:34.070
- Who's Briar Rose?
- I don't really know.

49:34.072 --> 49:35.972
I've dreamt about her
my entire adult life,

49:35.974 --> 49:38.407
always in Kaiser
Gardens, always asleep.

49:38.409 --> 49:42.478
Only when I inherited the property did
she wake up, but only in the dream.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.480
She said her body is
somewhere on the property

49:44.482 --> 49:45.681
and the only place
we haven't looked

49:45.683 --> 49:47.683
is deeper in those
basement rooms.

49:47.685 --> 49:51.821
- You say these are dreams?
- She also mentioned a demon.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.324
I saw this in a nightmare.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.727
Rose called it the Veiled Demon.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.865
I've seen this face before.

50:02.867 --> 50:06.969
In ancient drawings
in my trips to Jordan.

50:06.971 --> 50:10.473
She's called Shaytan
Al-Hayalshabat,

50:10.475 --> 50:13.876
which translates into
the Veiled Demon.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.447
In Greek mythology she's
the female version of Erebus.

50:18.449 --> 50:22.418
This must be the
source of the haunting.

50:24.555 --> 50:29.625
I think if we can find
Briar Rose and wake her up,

50:29.627 --> 50:31.861
it will break the curse.

50:38.836 --> 50:43.205
So, uh, does it say anything
about Rose or how to save her?

50:43.207 --> 50:47.343
I don't know. It's in
a coded ancient language.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.744
We're gonna have
to get somebody

50:48.746 --> 50:50.346
to help us translate this book.

50:50.348 --> 50:52.148
Well, you have
your ex-boyfriend.

50:52.150 --> 50:53.983
No, Richard.
He's not my ex-boyfriend.

50:53.985 --> 50:56.052
I went on two dates with him.
It was two dates.

50:56.054 --> 50:59.188
It was like a deal. He was gonna
help me with some things.

50:59.190 --> 51:01.357
You said the
deal was one date.

51:01.359 --> 51:03.159
The details are not important.

51:03.161 --> 51:06.595
["Carmen" by Bizet plays]

51:06.597 --> 51:09.598
- As I live and breathe.
- Hi, Daniel.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.535
Thanks for taking us
on such short notice.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.303
Sure thing.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.014
Richard, it's nice to
finally meet you in person.

51:25.016 --> 51:28.384
It's nice to see
everybody in the flesh.

51:28.386 --> 51:29.885
It's like a family reunion.

51:29.887 --> 51:33.122
Ah, and who's this?
Your boyfriend?

51:33.124 --> 51:34.523
He looks a little sickly.

51:34.525 --> 51:37.693
- Daniel!
- I kid, because I love.

51:37.695 --> 51:39.495
Come on in.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.074
Welcome to my secret lair.

51:52.076 --> 51:53.442
I knocked a few walls down,

51:53.444 --> 51:56.245
rewired the whole place myself.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.813
Pretty unique.

51:57.815 --> 52:03.018
[electronics tick and beep]

52:07.658 --> 52:10.626
Oh, here.
Let me show you.

52:15.266 --> 52:17.433
You see, it starts...

52:17.435 --> 52:19.468
Right here it gets dicey.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.437
[Daniel] All this writing
looks like Aramaic script.

52:21.439 --> 52:23.906
- Right.
- Oldest surviving Arabic grammar.

52:23.908 --> 52:26.642
Same as the last thing you gave me.
This could take a while.

52:26.644 --> 52:30.679
- How long will it take?
- How long?

52:30.681 --> 52:32.815
[scoffs] How long?

52:32.817 --> 52:34.850
Where'd you get this guy from?

52:34.852 --> 52:36.785
For your info, smart guy,

52:36.787 --> 52:38.587
I occasionally work
for the government

52:38.589 --> 52:40.189
doing stuff I can't talk about.

52:40.191 --> 52:41.624
The program that we're
using to figure out

52:41.626 --> 52:44.593
this ancient
journal, I wrote it.

52:44.595 --> 52:49.131
Okay. Daniel.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.167
Yeah, uh, we have to get
him back to the property

52:51.169 --> 52:53.502
or else his body's
gonna shut down.

52:53.504 --> 52:56.505
Oh, bummer. Sorry.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.174
[Richard] Daniel, it's gonna
be a long night.

52:58.176 --> 53:00.042
Let's just have a drink here.

53:00.044 --> 53:03.712
Mmm. It's an Irish recipe.

53:03.714 --> 53:07.183
I made it myself.

53:11.522 --> 53:14.723
I call this program
the Cypher Wizard.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.358
It uses some of
the same logarithms

53:16.360 --> 53:18.160
I use in code breaking
for the government.

53:18.162 --> 53:20.396
These ancient writings are
essentially a kind of code,

53:20.398 --> 53:21.697
with symbols and
double meanings.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.866
So you need to
translate on two levels,

53:23.868 --> 53:25.501
the language or symbols,
and what those symbols

53:25.503 --> 53:27.469
are really trying to
say, in the context

53:27.471 --> 53:29.572
of the symbols around it.

53:29.574 --> 53:32.174
So how did this ancient
book get into the house?

53:32.176 --> 53:33.676
I don't know how it got there.

53:33.678 --> 53:35.578
I can only tell
you what it says.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.513
[Richard] Now whoever
wrote this journal,

53:37.515 --> 53:39.515
no doubt one of your ancestors,

53:39.517 --> 53:41.083
has got an
unparalleled knowledge

53:41.085 --> 53:44.720
of both the language
and the supernatural.

53:46.023 --> 53:49.725
[Daniel]
All right, let's do some work.

54:18.022 --> 54:23.259
[knocking]

54:26.530 --> 54:27.796
Thomas?

54:27.798 --> 54:30.766
Door's open. You home?

54:36.607 --> 54:39.708
Thomas, electricity
still isn't working.

55:01.766 --> 55:03.132
Thomas?

55:28.693 --> 55:32.461
Thomas? Ya home?

55:32.463 --> 55:34.163
[sigh]

55:54.885 --> 55:57.586
[low growl]

56:00.825 --> 56:02.725
Hello?

56:24.548 --> 56:26.648
[chuckles]

56:26.650 --> 56:28.584
What are you doing here?

56:31.021 --> 56:34.656
[panting]

56:48.506 --> 56:51.106
[screech]

56:53.577 --> 56:56.745
[panicked breathing]

56:56.747 --> 56:59.047
Thomas?

56:59.049 --> 57:00.416
Is that you?

57:00.418 --> 57:01.550
[hissing]

57:01.552 --> 57:03.018
This isn't funny.

57:05.723 --> 57:10.426
[Billings screams]

57:26.277 --> 57:28.610
Hey.
[chuckles]

57:28.612 --> 57:30.746
I brought you some coffee.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.448
Thank you.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.954
- Do you mind if I sit?
- No, please.

57:45.396 --> 57:48.230
How's your shoulder?

57:50.568 --> 57:52.835
It's seen better days.

57:52.837 --> 57:55.370
For what it's worth,

57:56.907 --> 58:00.676
I'm really glad
that you're here,

58:00.678 --> 58:05.647
sharing this horrifying
experience with me.

58:08.085 --> 58:11.220
At least you have a
choice in the matter.

58:14.525 --> 58:18.093
You guys don't even
need to be here.

58:18.095 --> 58:21.129
Yet you are.

58:21.131 --> 58:26.702
Back in the city, I was just
going through the motions.

58:28.472 --> 58:31.373
I didn't care about
anything or anyone.

58:31.375 --> 58:34.710
Yeah, broken heart?

58:34.712 --> 58:36.545
No?

58:36.547 --> 58:38.514
Shit job?

58:40.351 --> 58:42.584
I was engaged.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.760
She got sick...

58:53.497 --> 58:57.065
And by the time they found
the cancer it was too late.

58:59.637 --> 59:01.904
And that was three years ago.

59:01.906 --> 59:04.706
I am so sorry.

59:06.410 --> 59:10.412
[sighs] I used her
death as an excuse

59:10.414 --> 59:12.748
to check out.

59:12.750 --> 59:17.986
I lost my job,
my house, everything.

59:21.358 --> 59:25.494
A friend graciously
put me in a cubicle

59:25.496 --> 59:28.797
but reality never quite set in.

59:31.201 --> 59:35.237
You on the other hand,
you lose a brother,

59:36.674 --> 59:40.776
and you become a regular
Nancy Drew. [laughs]

59:41.779 --> 59:43.946
[gurgling]

59:43.948 --> 59:45.414
Are you okay?

59:45.416 --> 59:47.583
[Thomas sighs]

59:50.087 --> 59:52.821
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:54.725 --> 59:58.794
It looks like I've traded one
shitty existence for another.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.932
Yeah, but we're close

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:07.069
to finding the
answers and the truth.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:09.938
I've had enough
answers for one day.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:24.353
[Richard groans]

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.595
It's just a lot at once

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:37.032
and I still don't know how
Rose fits into the picture.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:41.069
Rose, the girl
from your dreams?

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.338
We have this connection.

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:47.976
I can't explain it.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:50.579
They're more than dreams.

01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:52.648
They're so real.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.982
And after what happened today...

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.817
Wait, uh...

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.287
Are you saying that
you think that you have

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:04.793
some sort of real connection
with this Briar Rose?

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:06.662
Maybe.

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.336
Okay, um...

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.240
Well, uh...

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:22.811
I should um... Go.

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.613
I'm gonna take the
couch upstairs.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:27.015
You should get some sleep.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:31.086
Say hi to Briar Rose for me.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:19.901
[loud discord]

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.314
Thomas.

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:35.150
Yo.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.587
We got some new intel, bro.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:47.562
What do we got?

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.030
Well the journal was written
by one of your earliest

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:51.299
ancestors, William Kaiser,
during the Crusades.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.868
Shit's old.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.536
This is the first
page of the journal.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.738
"I, William Kaiser, have
wrought upon my family

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.641
a debt which shall
never be repaid.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:03.979
This sacrifice of a
virgin bride to Iblis."

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:08.049
In Islam, the devil
is known as Iblis.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:11.119
He's the first to
refuse to bow to Adam.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:14.556
- Essentially it's Satan.
- Well, Azazel, yes.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.792
The Quran and the Bible
have many similarities,

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.660
just different names.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:22.130
So William had connections
with Rose and Satan?

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.599
There. Briar Rose,
that's her name right?

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:27.068
She was royalty
known for her beauty.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:31.106
A djinn cursed her with a needle that pierced
her skin and put her in eternal sleep.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.507
Sounds like a fairy tale.

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:34.342
It must be Iblis
who wants her.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:37.279
Now, if this is real she's
alive, but she's trapped

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:41.249
in limbo, a slave to
the supernatural realm.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.585
The Veiled Demon is the guard
of Rose between these realms.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:45.353
The only other thing
that was deciphered so far

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.522
is, "The blood of our
line shall open the gate."

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.991
This phrase is next
to this picture.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.695
[Richard speaks in
a foreign language]

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.430
What are you doing?

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:57.666
I'm looking for protective
spells in the original Arabic.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.301
They must be somewhere in here.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.369
[gurgling]
[gasps]

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.772
Are you okay? I think we're
gonna have to get him back.

01:04:03.774 --> 01:04:05.874
No, it's too dangerous
to go back to the house.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:08.243
If it's just me we'll be fine.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.612
Oh no.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:11.880
[Linda] What?

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:14.015
Billings the appraiser.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.217
All right, it's all right.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.952
We'll be right back.

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:22.591
[hissing and snarling]

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:27.863
[Thomas groans]

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:34.302
[demonic laughter]

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.237
Thomas.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.138
Rose, where am I?

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.708
You have to move quickly,
Thomas. There's no time left.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.644
When you are away,
her evil thrives here.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.212
<i>Do not trust.</i>

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.881
[Linda] Just drive straight in.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:47.182
I can make it myself.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:48.917
No, you can't.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:51.553
When you confront
her in her true form

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:54.489
she can do more than haunt
and bestow nightmares.

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:56.858
Your bloodline will
no longer protect you.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.660
- [demonic laughter]
- [Thomas screams]

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.161
Stop.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.034
Are you okay?

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.103
Billings's car.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.705
- You all right?
- Just stay here and don't follow me!

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.141
Just trust me.
Billings!

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.115
[Thomas gasps]

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:32.260
This is it.
This ends right here, right now.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.262
Where are you taking us?

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.769
Ah, yes.

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:44.940
Yes, this is the symbol
for Iblis all right.

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:47.742
Azazel.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.744
I think that we should
get the cops involved.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:51.546
There is evidence all over
the second floor bedroom

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:53.214
that proves that
Billings was killed here.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.283
We can't get
the cops involved.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.985
Protocol would be to board this
place up for who knows how long.

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:58.954
I'd be booked as a
suspect and spend at least

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.455
a few nights in jail, and
that would not bode well for me.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.325
We can figure this
out for ourselves.

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:06.928
If we just find...

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.830
No! What...

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:18.173
[rumbling]

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:21.509
[thud]

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.250
Richard, there it is.

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:32.854
[Richard] That's the gateway.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:36.191
[Richard speaks in
a foreign language]

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:38.193
- Linda.
- Hm?

01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:46.001
Now, I uh...
I have this.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:49.604
- A gun?
- Well, ya never know.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:50.638
It's best to be prepared.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.940
[gun cocks]

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:56.444
How well do you know this guy?

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:59.006
You want to tell him
to sit this one out?

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.388
Watch out.

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:13.061
[bones crack]

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.568
[door creaks]

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:30.211
Well, it knows we're here.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.847
You said you have
protection spells, right?

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:35.016
Well, hopefully. I have a few
we could use in there.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:36.551
Hopefully?

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.354
Rose, she said I'm
no longer protected

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.523
once I'm near this Veiled Demon.

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:42.991
I could die in here.

01:07:42.993 --> 01:07:45.427
Well, that makes three of us.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.295
Let's go.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:08:00.842
[slithering]

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:12.754
[rattling roar]

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:17.826
[speaks in foreign language]

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:24.466
- Now that was a djinn.
- What did you do?

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:28.435
I just banished him back
to the hell he came from.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.904
Where are you going?

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:33.942
Well, I'm gonna follow him

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:36.478
unless you got a better idea.

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:47.956
[gate creaks]

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.460
What is this place?

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.229
[Linda] Looks like
a hospital from hell.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.071
[Thomas] These
mannequins are different

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:04.939
from the ones we saw.

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:08.676
It's like someone's
been working on them.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.979
It is hiding in here.
I can feel it.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:14.782
[low roar]

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:18.185
[distant cries]

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:20.121
Where did it go?

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.923
I'll check over here.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:11.906
Luke. My brother,
what have they done to you?

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:23.918
[snarling]

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:27.388
[gasping]

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.057
[gunshot]

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.929
[Thomas shouts]

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.771
[Linda shouts]

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.249
That was my brother Luke.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:58.686
No. No, he left long ago.

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:01.623
This is just an empty vessel.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.962
[clang]

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.931
It's still here.

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:17.272
Let's go get it.

01:11:24.214 --> 01:11:27.815
[ticking and beeping]

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.165
Oh, no.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.004
Not yet.
This is the final chamber.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:52.807
And there she is.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.909
The Veiled Demon.

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.762
And Briar Rose must
be lying asleep

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:18.266
just beyond those doors there.

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:26.140
- How do we get past it?
- Well, I don't know.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:29.210
We can distract her, keep
her busy for a while,

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.212
but you will have to wake Rose.

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:33.281
She's the only one
that can stop this.

01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:36.017
- I'm not leaving you guys.
- It's our only choice.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.152
- We're doing this together.
- Just listen to me.

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.821
We'll keep her busy.

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.824
You have to wake the Rose,
whatever happens to us.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.892
You've got to wake her.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.677
[Veiled Demon] I see you.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:05.880
Turn around and face us.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.784
[Richard speaks
foreign language]

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:13.588
[gunshot]

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:19.060
[Veiled Demon] Your spells
and weapons are useless here.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.729
Are you the maker?

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.364
Did you create these vessels?

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:25.700
You have a lot to answer for.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:31.572
All who enter my realm
will be punished.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:36.043
And their souls will be mine.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:37.545
I stand here in the name...

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:41.015
I have the power here,
as do the other djinns

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:43.885
tasked to stand
guard when the curse

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:47.588
was first brought forth.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.623
Other djinns?

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.959
There are 13 of us.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:56.030
- Where are they?
- I answer to no mortal.

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:57.565
You will answer to me!

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:01.035
- [snarling and cackling]
- [gasping]

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:07.975
How dare you enter
into my domain?

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.645
Fools.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:17.051
Your mortal eyes are blind.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:20.788
It is I who is the protector.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.257
Where is the young Kaiser?

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:27.728
[door creaks]

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:33.427
[creaking]

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:50.338
Bloodline...

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.036
Thank you.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:19.393
Now, the prophecy
can be fulfilled.

01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:26.967
Your task has been completed.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.870
Mine has just begun.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.740
And I have plans for you.

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:56.230
How dare you think
you could come in here

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.233
and break the curse?

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:03.437
Unleashing the evil
will summon the demons

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:07.374
of the doomed Kaiser bloodline.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:10.845
And I...
[gasping]

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:22.456
A thousand years.

01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:29.864
I have not forgotten.

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:32.633
[heartbeats]

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:34.201
[Thomas] Rose is evil.

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:36.170
You have to stop her.

01:19:41.711 --> 01:19:43.310
[Linda roars]

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:44.812
Linda!

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.117
Ah.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.988
There's a special small
taste of what's to come.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:58.192
I would kill you...

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.164
...but I want you to stay

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:07.902
to see all of the darkness
I have to show you.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:11.238
[Linda coughs]

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.840
[Rose giggles]

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.201
[wailing cries]

01:20:57.353 --> 01:21:01.288
[ticking and beeping]

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:05.226
"We are cursed with the
souls of demons in our blood.

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:10.130
They live within us, using
our bodies as their vessels.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:20.007
<i>First comes the nightmares.</i>

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:21.909
<i>Then the sickness
begins to take over</i>

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.144
<i>and he begins to hear
the spirits of the damned.</i>

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:29.550
<i>The souls of the Kaiser generations
seeping into his blood.</i>

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:31.886
<i>But be warned that one
must never communicate</i>

<i>with any demons,</i>

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:39.760
<i>for you never know if it is
a true beast, a true evil.</i>

<i>The one who will use our curse in
order to bring about the Qiyamat.</i>
