WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:07.353
One thing that never changes here
is the stupid idea

00:07.440 --> 00:10.637
that surgeons are cool
and medical residents are geeks.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.549
Oh, Rudy.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.552
- Lose the grapefruit goggles.
- It squirts in my eyes.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.030
That's a risk you take
with that particular piece of fruit.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.998
You guys, come on,
what do you say we dial down

00:22.080 --> 00:24.469
the whole power-nerd thing
a little bit, OK?

00:25.680 --> 00:28.877
Are you starting
your surgical elective tomorrow?

00:28.960 --> 00:32.839
Is that tomorrow? Whatever.
I don't really give a crap.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.311
Take a picture! Take a picture!
And you better smile this time.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.514
You guys look so cute.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.273
Carla, do you think
you could cut these for me?

00:44.360 --> 00:48.069
I've been working out so much,
these things are choking off my pythons.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.116
- You know?
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.354
At the end of the week, you gotta return
these bad boys to Janine.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.516
Janine's built like a bear.
She curled me once.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.388
Entering the hospital as a surgeon
has a whole different feel to it.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.116
Dude.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.159
You OK? You're acting weirder than the
time we saw Pat Benatar at Starbucks.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.390
How amazing was that morning?

01:31.480 --> 01:33.471
Listen, do me a favour.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.154
Don't try to overdo it
with these guys, all right?

01:36.240 --> 01:37.958
Just be you. OK? Be yourself.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.395
You know how I do. What's up, fellas?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.232
I know, I'm usually medical.

01:42.320 --> 01:45.278
I just want you guys to know
I consider you all my peepies.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.597
They know you mean peeps.
Just change the subject.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.831
- Somebody's been working out.
- What?

01:52.920 --> 01:53.909
Help me.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.914
- Dr Cox.
- Work. I hate you. You suck.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.752
I've been trying harder lately.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.071
Barbie, talking to the computer,
but nice self-esteem.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.355
Hey, cowboy.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.319
How about you back off the little lady
and we'll all agree you're scary.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.358
Listen there, I know
that your pink scrubs are balled up

02:14.440 --> 02:18.035
at the base of Barbie's bed three nights
a week, and congrats on that,

02:18.120 --> 02:21.715
but if you're going to have a showdown
with everyone who hassles her,

02:21.800 --> 02:24.314
then, gosh,
you two aren't gonna have any time

02:24.400 --> 02:28.313
for that sweet Aryan sex
that you love so much.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.790
- Hit the bricks, toe-heads.
- Come on, let's go.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.031
Why have we never fixed
or replaced this monstrosity?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.473
You know the deal.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.994
If it barely works,
it won't get replaced.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.595
I guess that explains why your ass
is still on the payroll, huh?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.830
Somebody stop me!

02:48.760 --> 02:50.830
- Morning, sport.
- Morning, captain.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.751
Am I the first they've done this to?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.274
No, man.
They did this to Frank Fracherman.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.033
- Who's Frank Fracherman?
- You're the first one.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.633
- Help me.
- Yeah.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.434
All right, don't sweat it, OK?
Stay on your toes.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.799
Sorry, girls, dropped my computer.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.675
Remember, when surgical residents
sense insecurity, they attack.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.275
- I'll watch out for that.
- Dude, your face, your face.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.796
- Man!
- Yeah, let's lose the tail too.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.832
How'd they get that on there, dawg?

03:41.920 --> 03:44.957
Buddy, I've got your back.
But lay low for awhile.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.996
- No problem.
- All right, people.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.435
How long till we get this thing started?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.635
Probably not for a few minutes.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.197
Should I file my Bell Biv DeVoe CD

03:58.280 --> 04:00.430
under B for Bell Biv
or under D for DeVoe?

04:00.520 --> 04:03.671
I don't know why you let Dr Cox
push you around like that.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.638
Do you notice that you're
always telling me what to do?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.756
I mean, in a good way.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.877
Then how come I'm growing
my bangs out and wearing a thong?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.871
You look better without the bangs.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.351
And the thong, well, that's not
up to me, that's the law, Missy.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.069
Not now. You know I don't like kissing
while I'm alphabetizing.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.709
Just so you know, I'm not folding
my clothes before we do it tonight.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.518
Yes, you are.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.591
Hey, Elliot, I just want to tell you

04:29.680 --> 04:32.399
that the last few weeks
have been really amazing.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.879
Thanks.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.151
I love U2.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.037
What did you just say?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.792
I said, I love U2.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.556
Dr Kelso, I was able to locate
the discharge form you wanted.

04:53.640 --> 04:59.078
She's a beauty, isn't she, Ted?
My pride and joy.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.549
I just had her varnished,
so don't touch.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.955
Here, hand it over.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.474
- Ted, you're a simpleton.
- That's funny.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.915
Cos I thought
I was rubber and you were glue.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.433
Idiot.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.471
- Principal Bob, you called?
- Can you explain this?

05:18.560 --> 05:20.676
It appears to be a wiring problem.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.719
Either way, second floor
desperately needs a new computer.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.876
Jackass.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.430
I was talking about him, you buffoon.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.957
Removing the old heart.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.749
- All right, JD, get in there.
- Turk's always looking out for me.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.229
I told you I'd hook you up.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.429
Oh, my God.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.796
Here it's my first day in surgery
and I'm holding a human heart.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.435
We were done with that one,
right, guys?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.392
- What you got there?
- Circular saw. Just bought it.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.836
Four horsepower, 3,500 rpms,
titanium finger guard.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.638
Why would you need a saw?

06:07.720 --> 06:10.678
- Why would a hen need a banjo?
- Why does a hen need a banjo?

06:10.760 --> 06:12.716
Why buy a saw
if I had no stuff to cut?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.189
- You wouldn't. That'd be crazy.
- Exactly.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.951
You need some help with that?

06:18.040 --> 06:20.031
No, thank you, I'm fine.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.792
Dammit.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.631
No, that'd be crazy.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.552
I was talking about U2 the band.
You know what? It's fine.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.235
He probably thinks I was saying it
the way you would say "l love eggs."

06:37.320 --> 06:39.709
I'm sure there is not
going to be a problem.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.637
We have a telegram
from Nurse Paul Flowers.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.999
That name is funny.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.594
This is my band.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.638
Oh, my God, Ted,
everybody knows. TV themes.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.838
That's old news, doll face,
we do commercial jingles now.

07:03.640 --> 07:08.589
The best part of waking up
Is Elliot in your cup

07:08.680 --> 07:10.159
In your cup...

07:10.240 --> 07:11.832
That's it?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.508
By Mennen

07:19.800 --> 07:22.075
It felt weird
not going to my normal table.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.720
Especially on
Palm Pilot Synchronization Day.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.360
And... now.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.908
But I was in surgery now.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.275
Still, even though Turk
was trying to help,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.112
I felt like such an outsider.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.397
I can't believe my girlfriend's
dragging me to the ballet.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.153
Your girlfriend?
Or your boyfriend?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.231
What's up?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.551
Turk did ballet.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.279
I just used it to help with my agility
for sports, that's all.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.998
You know.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.594
I never wore the clothes
or anything like that.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.398
Actually...

08:01.320 --> 08:04.153
Dude, close the door, close the door!

08:05.160 --> 08:06.878
I'll get you.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.599
Who wants some more?
You got... OK. Here's some.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.673
I have no words.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.150
How about handsome? Or glorious?

08:20.240 --> 08:24.233
And this abomination is the reason
we can't afford a new computer?

08:24.320 --> 08:25.799
Well, that...

08:25.880 --> 08:29.111
and the medical boondoggle
I have to go to in Cleveland.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.919
And by medical boondoggle,
I mean golf weekend,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.797
and by Cleveland, I mean Hawaii.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.996
Do you have any idea what people
around here think of you?

08:37.080 --> 08:39.753
I go to bed some nights wondering.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.400
And you know
what happens to me, Perry?

08:42.480 --> 08:47.031
I fall asleep.
And I mean like a log, brother.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.432
Anyway, I have to go catch my bus
to the airport.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.432
And by bus, I mean helicopter.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.479
I'll be right back.
Mr Dunaway somehow managed

09:06.560 --> 09:09.074
to wet both his and Mr Spiller's bed.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.151
You're slouching.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.474
You never explained
that U2 thing, did you?

09:15.560 --> 09:18.313
I've been thinking.
Maybe it's not such a bad thing.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.834
Things are going well.
Maybe it was fate.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.708
I could have looked at my Bell Biv DeVoe
CD and said, "l love Bell Biv DeVoe."

09:24.800 --> 09:27.268
Which I do, by the way.
And I'm not ashamed of it.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.992
I think that if you guys
are meant to get to this point,

09:34.080 --> 09:35.718
it'll happen naturally.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.836
You're right.
"l love U2." Dammit.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.388
Why do I say every thing
that comes into my head?

09:40.480 --> 09:43.711
I wish you wouldn't stand close to me
after your hummus break.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.234
See? I didn't need to say that.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.276
I'm gonna tell him.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.635
- Love you.
- Love you more.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.999
You know what?
Brush your teeth, then judge me.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.193
I gotta say,
it was nice to feel accepted.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.999
Remind me to burn that CD for you.
All right, player.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.072
Weight room later?
I might be able to get you two tickets.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.469
- To what?
- To the gun show, dawg.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.277
Sometimes you can't help
but get caught up in the moment.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.517
When that happens, you never know
what you're going to do.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.034
What's that all about?

10:23.120 --> 10:26.157
I'm afraid Dr Kelso has passed away.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.590
Or what you're gonna say to someone.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.716
I can't wait for my parents to meet you.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.313
Me neither.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.069
But if things are going well,
you should just ride the wave.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.993
Hey, T -Dog,
who are we slicing and dicing today?

10:44.080 --> 10:47.516
Well, J-Dog, I don't know
who you're slicing and dicing.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.592
I assigned you to another surgeon.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.796
What? Why?

10:52.880 --> 10:57.829
You deserve Ted's band today

10:57.920 --> 11:02.072
So get up and get away...

11:02.160 --> 11:04.469
Ted, you guys suck.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.354
So what if Turk switched me
to another surgeon?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.908
I can't worry about that now.
I'm here to learn.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.638
Are you even paying attention?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.029
I'm sorry.
Is it time to excise the tumour?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.829
No, it is time to realise
that we're operating on a naked chick.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.797
We will high-five later.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.474
And then I realised
why Turk was so pissed.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.316
He was the geek now.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.118
You're gonna get
in so much trouble for this.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.633
It's a joke.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.678
No one's going to believe
Kelso actually died.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.718
I don't know
if I should be alone tonight.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.750
He's with Jesus now.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.990
Tough break, big guy.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.232
Turk, Turk. Wait, wait, wait.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.471
Look, I can totally get you back in
with all the surgery boys.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.039
Can you? Really? Totally?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.475
I'll just talk to them.
Schmitty, Schultzy,

12:17.560 --> 12:20.472
Trigger, Fig Sack, Small Pete,
Little Pete, Tiny Pete,

12:20.560 --> 12:22.391
The Jackal, Aardvark and Steve.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.710
Dude, who the hell
are you talking about?

12:24.800 --> 12:28.679
We all went out last night. I made up
some new nicknames for all the fellas.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.671
By the way, you're Slappy Bag.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.637
You've lost it.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.395
- Come on, Slappy Bag.
- Don't call me Slappy Bag.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.111
- I told you you had nothing to saw.
- Really?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.949
Man, give it back.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.430
All right. Just tell me
why you're hitting yourself.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.192
Why are you doing that?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.749
Ever feel like
we're thinking the same thing?

13:04.840 --> 13:06.068
No.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.549
Hey, slow down on that Brie.
You know what cheese does to you.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.029
Yet another good tip.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.870
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about us lately.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.633
- Me too.
- God, you drive me crazy.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.199
You drive me crazy.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.350
I just lay awake
at night thinking about

13:30.440 --> 13:33.238
how unbelievably lucky
I am to have you in my life.

13:33.320 --> 13:37.393
Sometimes you're so controlling,
it makes me want to strangle you.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.674
My nose!

13:38.760 --> 13:41.593
Elliot,
are you trying to break up with me?

13:43.160 --> 13:45.469
Sorry, cheese.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.311
Coming through.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.755
Holy cow. You just
clean out a guy's office

13:52.840 --> 13:54.512
the second he goes deady-bye?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.797
- We can come back later.
- No.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.189
The quicker these memories
are removed,

14:00.280 --> 14:02.635
the sooner all of us
can get on with our lives.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.757
There's no way this desk
is fitting through that door.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.990
- I got it.
- Who are you?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.753
Just a man with a saw.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.034
Ten. Careful with that.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.476
- I think I can manage.
- That's a great set, Arnold.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.074
You got string
hanging from your sleeve there.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.355
I'm sorry, that's your arm.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.908
Sorry I told the surgeons
about your ballet.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.309
I don't give a crap
what these clowns think.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.995
Todd camped out in a wizard outfit
to see the last Harry Potter movie.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.958
You swore you wouldn't tell.
We even high-fived on it.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.871
Todd, we high-five on everything.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.758
That's such a lame excuse.
I'm totally pissed at you.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.478
High five.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.075
You were so desperate for the approval
of all these stupid surgeons

14:50.160 --> 14:52.355
you sold me down the river, huh?

14:52.440 --> 14:55.352
Oh, yeah?
Not all surgeons are stupid. OK?

14:55.440 --> 14:58.716
Fig Sack here went to Dartmouth.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.439
Wait, you're Aardvark.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.511
Schmitty?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.715
Hey, Bobcat. Welcome back.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.633
Look it, this whole thing
was a joke that, admittedly,

15:09.720 --> 15:11.233
got a little out of hand.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.279
In the meantime, this blank cheque
ought to cover the damage.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.351
A joke?

15:17.440 --> 15:20.398
Think it's funny they already
gave away my parking spot?

15:20.480 --> 15:24.109
Or that one of the surgeons
paid his dwarf cousin, Lance,

15:24.200 --> 15:28.193
$200 to show up at rounds
and sing Ding-Dong, Kelso's Dead?

15:29.080 --> 15:32.117
- And there it is.
- There what is?

15:32.200 --> 15:36.478
This whole l-don't-care-what-
people-think-about-me act.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.232
It's pretty convincing.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.834
But methinks there's
a sad little cartoon boy

15:40.920 --> 15:42.797
Iiving inside the hairy beast.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.998
He's sad because, at the end of the day,
he realises the only thing people think

15:47.080 --> 15:50.072
is what an evil son-of-a-bitch
he really is.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.589
See you later, Bobigator.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.793
If this cheque bounces,
I'm coming for you.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.391
How you doing, Ted?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.792
OK, here's what you do.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.519
Say that even though
our relationship is ending,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.318
you don't have any regrets.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.756
My God, are you actually telling me
how to break up with you?

16:15.840 --> 16:18.354
You're right. Go ahead.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.911
If you could just start me off,
that'd be super.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.468
Just tell me
we had a lot of fun together.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.675
We did.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.558
- Mostly you were really happy.
- I was.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.835
Say that you wished
you were mature enough

16:33.920 --> 16:36.388
to talk to me
about what was bothering you,

16:36.480 --> 16:39.472
because even though
I can be controlling sometimes,

16:39.560 --> 16:42.836
I really would have worked on it
for someone as special as you.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.589
You know what's funny?
When I said I love you,

16:46.680 --> 16:49.877
it was an accident
and I never really loved you at all.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.951
That is an absolute riot.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.838
No, I just mean that I wonder
how things would've gone

16:54.920 --> 16:57.275
if that had never happened.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.430
Me, too.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.753
Hi, can I buy you a drink?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.637
No, I'm good. Thank you.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.036
You see that, that right there?
That has never happened to me.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.917
A hot girl has never asked
to buy me a drink.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.036
Appletini, please. Easy on the tini.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.430
- No problem, lady.
- Man...

17:25.520 --> 17:29.195
Ever since college you always
make everything seem so easy.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.636
No matter where you are,
you always fit in.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.439
I don't know, I thought
with this surgery elective,

17:35.520 --> 17:37.988
it might be nice not to feel
like a total dork.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.559
JD, Look at me.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.598
- You are a dork.
- Not all the time.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.274
Every second
since the moment I met you.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.233
Hey, I'm JD. I am so stoked
to be your roommate.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.311
Right on.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.312
What are you talking about?
You said hoops were cool.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.039
Hey, baby. Champag-nee?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.509
Med-school chicks love ventriloquists.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.239
He's right, they do.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.471
Tannest intern, baby.
And it comes in a bottle.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.120
Appletini, please. Easy on the tini.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.031
The thing I always liked about you
was that you were yourself,

18:15.120 --> 18:17.236
never cared about
what people thought.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.515
And that's why you hung out with me?

18:19.600 --> 18:22.558
No, you had a car. Still do.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.269
Come on, player,
you know I'm way more stud than dud.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.915
Wow, you can really taste the apples.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.275
I think everyone would like to believe

18:33.360 --> 18:35.749
it's possible to become
someone different.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.035
To change how people see us.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.112
I told you he'd buckle.
How's that new computer? Good?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.714
We wouldn't know.
This one's from like, 1 970.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.756
What did he do with the new one?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.839
But sometimes change
doesn't last for long.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.959
By golly, you're so pretty,
I may not even use you.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.830
And other times it just makes
you miss what you had.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.670
A little.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.518
As for me,
I'm happy just knowing who I am.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.629
Hey, JD, do you have any nasal spray?

19:17.720 --> 19:20.393
No problem, Dougster.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.515
For I am John Dorian.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.749
King of the Nerds.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.990
Hey, JD, you OK?

19:31.720 --> 19:34.234
I'm fine.
Don't bogart my nasal spray.
