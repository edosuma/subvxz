WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:04.037
(Man) ... has traffic backed up
on the West Side highway.

00:04.104 --> 00:06.974
The red-carpet event
was thought to be a fund-raiser

00:07.040 --> 00:08.942
for Patrick Darling's
senate campaign,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.943
but turns out
its just a birthday party

00:11.011 --> 00:12.946
for their family lawyer
Nick George.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.948
And that’s your weather
and traffic...

00:15.015 --> 00:16.049
(Reporters all shouting at once)

00:16.116 --> 00:18.986
(Man) Mister--Mr. George,
how did you do it?

00:19.052 --> 00:21.021
Will Tripp
be putting his power

00:21.088 --> 00:24.992
behind Patrick's
senate campaign?
Yes, but to what extent
remains a question.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.060
Nick, tell us,
as the Darling family lawyer,

00:27.127 --> 00:30.063
how were you able to broker
this historic reconciliation

00:30.130 --> 00:32.064
between father and son?

00:32.131 --> 00:35.002
Well, it was, uh,
it was quite an adventure.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.004
Thank you.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.039
(Reporters all shouting at once)

00:39.106 --> 00:42.009
(Man) What--what are your plans
for your birthday?

00:42.075 --> 00:44.044
(Letitia)
Here's the birthday boy.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.046
Letitia Darling,
you look beautiful.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.015
How are you?

00:48.081 --> 00:51.018
Mm. Sorry we didn't have time
to plan anything too fancy.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.954
Oh, well, I'm sure
this will be just fine.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.056
Happy Birthday, Nick.
Thank you.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.025
(Queen and David bowie's
"under pressure" playing)

00:58.091 --> 00:59.993
Have you seen my wife?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.995
Lisa's not with you?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.933
No. No.
If you'll excuse me.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.001
Patrick, where's that wife
of yours?

01:08.068 --> 01:12.039
Ellen's not alcoholically
indisposed again, is she?

01:12.105 --> 01:13.974
No, mother.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.043
I'm sure she's just running
a few moments late.

01:16.109 --> 01:19.046
(Laughs) No.
Brian used to be a minister.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.982
He was one for ten years.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.984
But he's working for me now.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.954
Got a little
too much sun, hmm?

01:27.020 --> 01:29.022
Yeah, paddy and I
went sailing yesterday

01:29.089 --> 01:31.024
off our place
in the Hamptons.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.927
Hey, Nick.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.996
I want you to meet
an old friend of mine.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.999
Hal Matheson, Nick George.
Nice to meet you.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.968
Your dad
was a hell of a guy.

01:41.034 --> 01:45.005
He'd be so proud of you
if he was still with us.
Thank you.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.040
Hey, Brian.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.977
(Lowered voice) You haven't
seen Lisa, have you?

01:50.043 --> 01:53.947
No. But if you see

Nick...

03:01.114 --> 03:03.050

03:03.116 --> 03:04.985
Never before--

03:05.052 --> 03:07.955
well, maybe once before,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.924
and I'm thinking
of Nick's dad Dutch--

03:10.991 --> 03:14.127
has one man done so much

that boat.

(Woman) What's going on?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.966
What's going on?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.068
(Man) N. Y. P. D.
Prepare to be boarded.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.971
What's happening, Nick?
Nobody move.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.041
What did you do, Nick?
Prepare to be boarded.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.011
What the hell did you do?

04:04.077 --> 04:07.981
(Siren wailing)

04:08.048 --> 04:10.984
Tripp and Letitia want to
throw me a birthday party.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.987
It'll be small and simple,
just us and the Darlings.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.989
The Darlings don't do
small and simple.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.992
Well, then it'll be
large and complicated,

04:19.059 --> 04:21.060
but we have to do it.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.032
Where are you going
all dressed up?
Gallery hunting.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.968
Nick, I was really hoping
it would be just us

04:28.035 --> 04:30.938
for your birthday this year.
All right. Here's what
we're gonna do--

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
we're gonna get a sitter
for tonight,

04:33.006 --> 04:35.008
and we're gonna have
our dinner, just us.
Thank you.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.978
But tomorrow, we're gonna go
yachting with the Darlings.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.047
Semi formal.
Perfect. I'm looking
semi-forward to it.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.983
(Laughs) All right.
I have got to go.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.018
Six months of mending fences
between Patrick and Tripp

04:45.085 --> 04:47.955
are about to finally pay off.
Must be some fence.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.957
Well, you said it
yourself, Lisa.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.993
The Darlings don't do
small and simple.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.996
If you don't want me involved

04:56.063 --> 04:58.966
in your senate campaign, son,
just say so.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.034
Of course
I want you involved, dad.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.938
But you don't know how to be
involved without creating an air

05:05.005 --> 05:07.040
of constant judgment
and pervasive meddling.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.042
Patrick,
we just made headway.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.980
Let me guess where you get
those ideas from. Simon elder.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.982
I get my ideas
from my own mind, dad.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.984
I severed ties with Simon
a long time ago.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.020
Ever since you left this
family's sphere of influence,

05:20.087 --> 05:24.024
your life has spun
completely out of control.
Out of your control, perhaps.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.993
Listen,
you're a passionate family.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.028
You're a family of
strong opinions, so naturally,

05:28.095 --> 05:30.964
sometimes you're gonna
get into conflict.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.001
But at the end of the day,
you're still a family.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.037
You love each other.
You're there for each other.
His campaign is in a shambles!

05:37.104 --> 05:40.040
We're still ahead
in the polls.
Not for long
if that wife of yours

05:40.107 --> 05:42.042
keeps showing up
at every campaign speech,

05:42.109 --> 05:44.945
at every fund-raiser
three sheets to the wind.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.981
The rigors of public life
have taken their toll, yes.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.984
Maybe it's just that she's
trying to deaden the pain

05:51.051 --> 05:53.053
of having lost you
to your vanished Carmelita.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.989
That's it, Nick.
We're--we're done, here.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.025
Wait a second.
Everybody just calm down.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.994
Now I have worked--
we've all worked--

06:01.061 --> 06:02.996
the last six months
to make this moment happen.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.032
Well, this moment is over.
(Tripp)
Oh, don't be a fool, paddy.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.034
Because when you
come back to me,

06:07.100 --> 06:10.971
asking for my assistance,
asking for my acceptance--
you don't get it, dad, do you?

06:11.038 --> 06:13.941
I'm never going to ask you
for anything...

06:14.007 --> 06:16.109
Ever again.

06:20.113 --> 06:24.017
Lisa. Bella bambina!

06:24.084 --> 06:26.019
Come stai?
(Honks horn)

06:26.086 --> 06:27.988
Jeremy Darling, stalker.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.024
Is that the headline you're
longing to read on T. M. Z.?

06:31.091 --> 06:34.061
What do you mean?
I'm just tooling around.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.064
This just-showing-up thing was
cute, oh, the first 17 times.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.067
Now it's just starting
to get weird.
Cut me some slacks. I can't
stop thinking about you...

06:40.133 --> 06:42.936
Ever since that night
we kissed.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.005
That was six months ago,
and we didn't kiss.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.008
You kissed me.
You kissed me back...
A little.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.010
I mean, it wasn't
"the notebook,"

06:50.077 --> 06:53.013
but I distinctly recall
a kiss back.
Look, marriages
go through phases,

06:53.080 --> 06:55.949
and when I let you kiss me,
mine was in a bad one.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.985
It's in a better one now.
Can we have dinner tonight?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.954
I am having dinner at Etienne
with Nick, my husband,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.056
and we--you and me--
are not happening,

07:03.123 --> 07:05.959
for dinner or anything.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.062
Please leave me alone
and get a helmet.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.967
(Karen) That was amazing.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.002
(Laughs)

07:15.068 --> 07:17.938
(Laughs)
I'm all discombobulated now.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.006
Yeah. Mm.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.007
Mwah.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.008
Huh.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.977
Would you make me
some orange juice, please,

07:24.044 --> 07:27.014
with a little gin in it?
Sure.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.982
(Grunts)

07:29.049 --> 07:31.018
Actually,
hold the orange juice.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.986
(Laughs) All right,
all right.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.988
Oh, hey, there's, um,
a fund-raiser tonight

07:35.055 --> 07:37.024
at the Brooklyn
botanical gardens.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.026
I'm giving them
a $10-million grant

07:39.092 --> 07:41.929
to do research
in the rain forest.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
You want to go?
Sure. Sounds planty.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.000
I just have to make
an appearance at home first.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.937
Ah, so Tripp still has
no idea his daughter

07:50.003 --> 07:51.939
is sleeping
with the enemy, huh?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.007
No, he's completely clueless
still.

07:54.074 --> 07:58.011
Well, don't be so sure.
People figure things out.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.948
What--what--
what are you doing?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.950
Going through your stuff.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.952
What's the story
with this one?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.921
Well...

08:07.988 --> 08:11.024
When I first came
to New York...

08:11.091 --> 08:13.994
I wasn't sure if I'd ever
amount to anything...

08:14.061 --> 08:15.963
Oh.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.965
So I saw that
in a shop window,

08:18.031 --> 08:20.033
and it reminded me
of the ugly duckling.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.003
You know,
it turned into a swan.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.005
It's not worth much,

08:25.072 --> 08:29.009
but it's a... reminder
of a simpler time.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.011
That's sweet.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.046
(Sets swan down)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.015
What?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.984
I love you.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.953
Wow.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.054
Thank you.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.060
I think
you're really neat, too.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.096
(Laughs)

08:53.000 --> 08:55.002
Good afternoon.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.937
Oh, I hope so, Daisy.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.972
'Cause the morning
monumentally sucked.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.942
Oh, Karen Darling's
here to see you.
Hi, Nick.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.011
(Sighs) Karen.
What can I do for you?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.947
Well, for starters,
close the door.

09:07.014 --> 09:07.948
Why?

09:08.015 --> 09:10.117
I have to give you
your present.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.023
Happy Birthday.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.959
♪♪♪

09:29.069 --> 09:31.038
Karen, put your dress
back on.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.973
I brought you some grappa.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.942
No, the nudity was enough.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.009
Get dressed.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.978
All right. Gee.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.047
Grumpy Gus.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.983
Would you
at least pour me a drink?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.017
Thank you.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.955
What the hell is going on?
Why are you doing this?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.023
Simon told me he loved me.
Mm.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.026
You're still seeing Simon?
Oh, yeah, I'm snooping on him
for daddy.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.996
Thanks for keeping me
in the loop.
You know what, Nick?

09:56.063 --> 10:00.033
When you have a problem,
I'm always there for you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.969
Sorry.

10:02.035 --> 10:02.970
Okay.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
What's the problem, Karen?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.975
Simon's falling for me,
and... (Sighs)

10:08.041 --> 10:11.011
I kinda feel like,
I don't know...

10:11.078 --> 10:12.946
Bad.

10:13.013 --> 10:13.981
Huh?
Yeah.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.048
So remove yourself.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.951
Well, that's what
I'm trying to do.
Yeah?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.953
Mm-hmm.
By showing up here naked
and coming on to me?

10:20.020 --> 10:23.924
Mm-hmm. You're my exit ramp,
you know.
No, I am not
an exit ramp, Karen.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.993
I'm just your old boyfriend
that you run to when you start

10:26.059 --> 10:27.995
to have feelings
for anyone else.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.931
Yeah, that's kinda what I mean
by "exit ramp," Nick.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.933
Listen, if you want out
of this predicament, which you

10:33.000 --> 10:34.935
got yourself into, you're gonna
have to do it yourself.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.937
I'm not gonna
kiss you out of it.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.972
(Singsong) Well, I was hoping
for a little more than a kiss.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
Well, you're not
gonna get anything.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.944
So pull back, step out,
absent yourself.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.946
You have choices.
(Normal voice) Wow.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.049
Okay.
Thanks for understanding, Nick.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.986
Oh, hey.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.056
Happy Birthday.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.322
I hate this.

11:02.389 --> 11:04.391
We're almost done.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.294
Well, we could wreck it
and start over.

11:07.361 --> 11:09.329
Ate logo to you, too.
(Cell phone beeps)

11:09.396 --> 11:11.298
What's your problem,
Cruella?

11:11.365 --> 11:13.300
That was
the Brazilian consulate.

11:13.367 --> 11:16.336
There's still this
strangely unspecified holdup

11:16.403 --> 11:18.338
with our visas.

11:18.405 --> 11:21.308
Shrimp doesn't mind.
Go rub a crystal.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.310
This was supposed to be
a one-week visit, Brian.

11:23.377 --> 11:25.379
It's stretched out
to nearly four.

11:25.445 --> 11:27.381
And you're telling me you had
nothing to do with this.

11:27.447 --> 11:30.384
Why is it so important
that you get back to Brazil?

11:30.450 --> 11:33.353
I mean, why are you even
living there at all?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.289
Andrea.

11:35.355 --> 11:37.291
Oh, hi, Tripp.

11:37.357 --> 11:39.359
Your stay continues
to be pleasant?

11:39.426 --> 11:42.329
More long than pleasant.

11:42.396 --> 11:44.331
Brian, could I--

11:44.398 --> 11:47.434
may I steal you away?

11:50.337 --> 11:52.339
I need you to talk to Ellen.

11:52.406 --> 11:54.308
Why, you need me to get
her recipe

11:54.374 --> 11:56.310
for long island iced tea?

11:56.376 --> 11:59.346
No, I want you
to counsel her.

11:59.413 --> 12:01.281
Counsel?

12:01.348 --> 12:02.349
Yes.

12:02.416 --> 12:04.351
Patrick may no longer
think of himself

12:04.418 --> 12:06.353
as an extension of this family,

12:06.420 --> 12:08.355
but the rest of the world does.

12:08.422 --> 12:10.290
And his wife...

12:10.357 --> 12:12.359
It's obvious that Ellen
is terribly unhappy.

12:12.426 --> 12:15.362
But that unhappiness is turning
her into a public embarrassment.

12:15.429 --> 12:17.364
I left the church
and took this job

12:17.431 --> 12:20.300
so I wouldn't have to smile
and nod and pretend I care

12:20.367 --> 12:22.302
about
other people's problems.

12:22.369 --> 12:25.305
When you sent me to Munich
to fire all those people

12:25.372 --> 12:27.374
and close down that factory,
that was fun.

12:27.441 --> 12:31.278
Are you telling--
are--are you saying no?

12:31.345 --> 12:34.281
Yeah. I'm saying no.

12:34.348 --> 12:35.315
(Chuckles)

12:35.382 --> 12:38.352
Well, yes.

12:38.418 --> 12:41.288
Thank you for your frankness.

12:41.355 --> 12:44.358
I count on it.

12:47.361 --> 12:51.265
It is the biggest dead end
in the world, Mr. Darling.

12:51.331 --> 12:53.300
This Carmelita,

12:53.367 --> 12:56.270
this so-called lady friend
of yours,

12:56.336 --> 12:58.272
she doesn't want to be found.

12:58.338 --> 13:02.276
But to have her just...
Out there somewhere...

13:02.342 --> 13:04.278
Not knowing...

13:04.344 --> 13:07.314
Just... it kills me.

13:07.381 --> 13:10.284
You want my advice,
Mr. Darling?

13:10.350 --> 13:12.352
Go home to your pretty wife.

13:12.419 --> 13:15.289
My pretty wife, Mr. Cameron,
is a belligerent drunk

13:15.355 --> 13:17.357
who calls me names
in front of my children

13:17.424 --> 13:19.359
and takes swings at me
in public,

13:19.426 --> 13:21.328
that is when she's not online

13:21.395 --> 13:24.331
ordering single barrel bourbon
by the case.

13:24.398 --> 13:27.267
Keep looking.

13:27.334 --> 13:29.336
Never give up.

13:35.442 --> 13:38.245
Where the hell have you been?

13:38.312 --> 13:40.247
Good evening, foster Brooks.

13:40.314 --> 13:42.282
Answer me.

13:42.349 --> 13:44.351
You were looking for her again,
weren't you?

13:44.418 --> 13:47.287
"Her." (Scoffs)
I should say "it."

13:47.354 --> 13:49.356
I've been out campaigning...

13:49.423 --> 13:50.324
(Laughs)

13:50.390 --> 13:52.326
And working at my office,
Ellen.

13:52.392 --> 13:55.262
Oh, God, you disgust me.
You know that?

13:55.329 --> 13:57.297
I disgust you, really?

13:57.364 --> 13:59.333
Yeah. You're a pervert.

13:59.399 --> 14:02.336
I'd forbid our children
to be alone with you

14:02.402 --> 14:04.338
if you weren't their father.

14:04.404 --> 14:06.406
I could still do it.

14:08.408 --> 14:10.377
What's the matter
with me, pat?

14:10.444 --> 14:14.314
What did I ever do to you?

14:14.381 --> 14:17.317
Well, you shot me
in the leg, Ellen.

14:25.459 --> 14:29.329
I'm going to take a shower...

14:29.396 --> 14:34.268

of this marriage off my body.

you were flying solo.

Don't sit down.

kinda blue.

I will totally flee the scene.

19:54.828 --> 19:56.697

a hand on her,

20:09.810 --> 20:12.746

the police now.
I completely agree.

to tell me on the phone

20:15.749 --> 20:17.684

20:21.788 --> 20:24.725

increases the appearance--

20:24.791 --> 20:27.694
I know.
That's what I'm thinking about,

20:27.761 --> 20:31.698
about how this will look
and the toll that it will take.

20:31.765 --> 20:34.735

No, on the family,
on the kids.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.771

is going to do with this.

20:37.838 --> 20:40.741

to do?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.709
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

20:42.776 --> 20:45.746
Although you do make a very
strong case about the election.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.749
I mean, if this gets out,
that'll be done.
Did you seriously expect me
to show up here,

20:48.815 --> 20:50.784
move her body,
put it somewhere else,

20:50.851 --> 20:54.755
set it on fire and make it all
look like an accident?
It's what Dutch would've done.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.691

pat--a permanent address

20:57.758 --> 20:59.660

20:59.726 --> 21:01.728

21:11.772 --> 21:14.708
It's many things, Nick, many.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.710
All right, look...

21:16.777 --> 21:19.746
If I were you,
I'd call the police.

21:19.813 --> 21:23.684
Once this situation
becomes a legal matter,

21:23.750 --> 21:26.687
I hope you'll call me as your
family lawyer to do my part.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.689
But right now
this isn't a legal situation.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.756
It's a moral one,

21:29.823 --> 21:32.726
and as of right now,
it's not mine, it's yours.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.661
Good night.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.697
(Sighs)

21:36.763 --> 21:38.732
(Door opens and closes)
What are we gonna do?

21:38.799 --> 21:42.736
Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.806
We must follow
Nick's sage advice.

21:49.743 --> 21:50.677
Hey.

21:50.744 --> 21:51.712
Hey.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.681
The car's waiting for us
downstairs.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.683
You're going dressed
like that to the benefit?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.685
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm not going.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.754
Okay.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.756
Wild guess--

22:02.823 --> 22:05.692
I'm tired. That's it.
That's all.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.761
Karen, uh, you know
that it's okay

22:07.828 --> 22:09.763
if you don't want
to say I love you.

22:09.830 --> 22:12.699
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

22:12.766 --> 22:13.767
No. Maybe a little, yeah.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.669
Okay.

22:15.736 --> 22:18.672
You know I could have
any woman in New York?

22:18.739 --> 22:21.742
But I've chosen you
because I enjoy being with you,

22:21.808 --> 22:23.677
so I said it.

22:23.744 --> 22:25.679
You don't
have to say it back.

22:25.746 --> 22:27.714
But while we're at it
and we're being honest,

22:27.781 --> 22:30.784
let's just get it all
out on the table.
(Scoffs)

22:30.851 --> 22:34.721
I know why you're seeing me,
and I know it's for one reason

22:34.788 --> 22:36.690
and one reason only,

22:36.757 --> 22:38.792
and that is to gather dirt
for daddy.

22:40.761 --> 22:42.763
Well, I...

22:42.829 --> 22:45.766
Y--'cause it started out
that way, but it's not--

22:45.832 --> 22:47.734
let's cut to the chase.

22:47.801 --> 22:48.802
Karen...

22:48.869 --> 22:52.673
I made my first fortune
on a prism,

22:52.739 --> 22:54.741
a computer processor

22:54.808 --> 22:57.778
that could read information
on waves of light.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.781
Now...

23:00.847 --> 23:02.716
In six months...

23:02.783 --> 23:05.652
(Cap pops)

23:05.719 --> 23:07.688
I'm gonna roll this out.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.755
What is that?

23:08.822 --> 23:11.825
A fuel--
cleaning burning...

23:15.796 --> 23:17.764
Nontoxic.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.766
This is going to do
for transportation

23:19.833 --> 23:21.768
what my prism did
for information.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.705
It's gonna change everything.

23:24.771 --> 23:28.675
It's yours. I want you
to take this to your father.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.677
Let him hand it over
to his chemists.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.679
They--they're gonna have fun
figuring this out.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.681
And your father
will make more money

23:34.748 --> 23:36.683
than even he
could ever imagine.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.752
I'll lose millions in r&amp;D,

23:38.819 --> 23:42.756
but hey, daddy's happy,
right?

23:42.823 --> 23:46.727
Because that's what this
is all about, right?

23:46.793 --> 23:50.764
Keeping daddy happy?

24:01.842 --> 24:05.712
(Laughs) Oh, my God.

24:05.779 --> 24:09.683
We really did not need to drink
that whole second bottle.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.752
I respectfully disagree.
A high-end buzz becomes you.

24:11.818 --> 24:15.689
Oh. Jeremy.

24:15.756 --> 24:17.791
Jeremy, you saved me from
a night full of self-pity.

24:17.858 --> 24:19.760
Thank you.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.663
(Laughs)

24:22.729 --> 24:24.665
But this is where it ends.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.699
Meaning?

24:25.766 --> 24:28.735
Meaning don't try
and kiss me.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.837
I wasn't going to.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.779
Damn it, Jeremy.
Why do you do that?
Ow!

24:38.845 --> 24:40.747
Because I think
you're beautiful.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.749
Come on, Lise, you got stood up
for a birthday dinner

24:42.816 --> 24:45.752
you were trying to throw
for someone else.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.722
You're the prettiest girl
in New York,

24:48.789 --> 24:50.724
and you know you want me
to kiss you.

24:50.791 --> 24:53.760
Or you want to kiss me,
whichever.

24:54.795 --> 24:56.730
I don't.

24:56.797 --> 24:59.700
I know you are unable
to believe me when I say it,

24:59.766 --> 25:01.835
but I really don't.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.825
(Door closes)

25:26.760 --> 25:28.729
Nick!

25:28.795 --> 25:30.697
Nick!
Nick, Nick, wait!

25:30.764 --> 25:32.666
(Nick) Let's go.

25:32.733 --> 25:34.701
Nick, wait! Wait!

25:34.768 --> 25:36.703
Nick!

25:47.781 --> 25:49.783
(Cell phone rings)

25:49.850 --> 25:52.753
(Ring)

25:52.819 --> 25:54.755
(Ring)

25:54.821 --> 25:56.823
(Rings and beeps)

25:58.825 --> 26:01.762
Maybe my family and your family
are just a bad combination,

26:01.828 --> 26:04.731
you know?

26:04.798 --> 26:06.733
You ever think of that?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.769
It's crossed my mind.

26:08.835 --> 26:12.773
Your mom and my dad,
my wife and your brother...

26:12.839 --> 26:15.709
I don't know,
you and me...

26:15.776 --> 26:17.778
I mean, there are people
all over the world

26:17.844 --> 26:19.780
whose interactions
are simple and clean

26:19.846 --> 26:22.749
and generally lead to
good things happening, right?
Yeah, well...

26:22.816 --> 26:24.818
(Clinks glasses)
Here's to them.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.692
I'm sorry.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.795
About what?
Just the way I talked to you
when you showed up here naked...

26:34.861 --> 26:36.697
Oh.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.766
When I said
you have choices.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.736
'Cause maybe we don't,
really.

26:42.803 --> 26:46.707
You know, maybe Lisa doesn't.
Maybe Jeremy doesn't.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.775
Maybe you don't,
and maybe I don't.

26:50.811 --> 26:52.746
I don't know.
Maybe Patrick doesn't.

26:52.813 --> 26:54.681
Patrick?

26:54.748 --> 26:57.684
I just mean that maybe...

26:57.751 --> 26:59.753
It's all just chemistry,
you know?

26:59.820 --> 27:01.755
You know, you just...

27:01.822 --> 27:03.757
You want what you want

27:03.824 --> 27:07.794
and you can't
stop wanting it.

27:07.861 --> 27:10.831
Maybe it's that simple.

27:14.835 --> 27:17.671
Yeah, you're drunk.

27:17.738 --> 27:19.773
And you're beautiful.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.749
And you're
thinking about Simon.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.684
I am.

27:30.751 --> 27:32.853
(Telephone rings)

27:34.821 --> 27:37.824
(Ring)

27:40.794 --> 27:43.664
I can't talk
right now, Lisa.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.765
No, I'm sorry.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.733
It's nothing.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.671
Everything's fine. No.
No, it's nothing.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.673
Yeah, I can be there.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.675
I'll see you then.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.776
Who was that?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.778
(Sighs)
That was your father.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.680
Oh.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.682
8:00 tomorrow morning--
I've been summoned.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.750
(Sighs)

28:04.851 --> 28:07.688
What?

28:07.754 --> 28:11.792
You and I are not
a bad combination, Nick.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.762
It's just it's--
it's--it's bad timing.

28:35.749 --> 28:39.720
Hey, mom.
Where the hell is my son?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.688
He and Andrea just left.

28:41.755 --> 28:43.757
I begged her to stay
and say good-bye,

28:43.824 --> 28:46.693
but she said that they could
still catch the flight.
Their visas came through?

28:46.760 --> 28:49.730
Yes. She said she got
a phone call from the consulate

28:49.796 --> 28:50.797
out of the blue.

28:50.864 --> 28:54.668
Next thing I knew, she w--
she was grabbing little Brian

28:54.735 --> 28:56.737
along with the luggage
and, well, to be honest,

28:56.803 --> 28:58.772
a few of our best towels.
Where's Tripp?

28:58.839 --> 29:01.775
Why? Do you want him
to intervene?

29:04.811 --> 29:07.848
He already did.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.801
(Remote control chirps)

29:37.844 --> 29:40.681
Excellent, Clark.

29:40.747 --> 29:42.749
Well done. Thank you.

29:43.817 --> 29:45.686
You wanted to see me?

29:45.752 --> 29:46.853
Yeah. Please.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.697
Do you know how many men died
building the Brooklyn bridge?

29:56.763 --> 29:57.764
No idea.

29:57.831 --> 29:59.666
27.

29:59.733 --> 30:02.669
27 for a bridge that,
every day,

30:02.736 --> 30:05.706
more than a million people
go back and forth on.

30:05.772 --> 30:09.710
So this is your way of saying
that Ellen was expendable?

30:09.776 --> 30:10.777
No, no, no, no.

30:10.844 --> 30:13.714
Just that for every venture...

30:13.780 --> 30:16.683
There are costs.

30:16.750 --> 30:19.720
People aren't costs, Tripp.
They're people.

30:19.786 --> 30:22.723
Ellen contrived a life
that can be best described

30:22.789 --> 30:26.693
as a venal venture

30:26.760 --> 30:28.729
in which, regrettably,

30:28.795 --> 30:32.666
she did not have the strength
to play her role.

30:32.733 --> 30:35.702
In the end, she resorted
to drink and...

30:35.769 --> 30:38.739
Finally, last night,
once again...

30:38.805 --> 30:40.774
To violence.

30:40.841 --> 30:43.777
She had none of the patience
and grace

30:43.844 --> 30:47.848
that make your marriage
to Lisa such a blessing.

30:50.717 --> 30:52.753
Yeah, I'm a lucky man.

30:52.819 --> 30:54.755
All I asked her to do

30:54.821 --> 30:57.758
was to help protect my son
and his innocent children

30:57.824 --> 31:00.761
from what would
surely have become

31:00.827 --> 31:03.797
an immensely destructive
misunderstanding.

31:05.832 --> 31:07.768
What do you want
from me, Tripp?

31:07.834 --> 31:10.771
I want you to allow yourself

31:10.837 --> 31:13.674
to become
a part of this family.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.710
Oh, I know we're not perfect.
We're messy.

31:16.777 --> 31:18.679
But you yourself said

31:18.745 --> 31:21.748
that at the end of the day,
we love each other.

31:21.815 --> 31:24.685
Let yourself
be a part of that.

31:24.751 --> 31:27.754
You are a son to me.

31:27.821 --> 31:30.691
Let us love you.

31:30.757 --> 31:31.792
(Jeremy) Dad.

31:31.858 --> 31:35.696
I'm gonna have to bail
on Nick's party.

31:35.762 --> 31:38.699
D--hey, Nick.
Hi, Jeremy.

31:38.765 --> 31:41.668
Did you...

31:41.735 --> 31:43.770
What--I-I should go.

31:43.837 --> 31:46.807
Jeremy, wait, wait, wait.
There's one thing.

31:48.775 --> 31:50.744
(Jeremy) Oh!

31:52.779 --> 31:55.716
I will be at my office...

31:55.782 --> 31:58.719
If you need anything else
taken care of.

32:14.835 --> 32:17.671
You ready to talk?

32:17.738 --> 32:21.675
I'm ready to listen.

32:21.742 --> 32:24.711
I was drunk, Nick, and...

32:24.778 --> 32:26.780
You left me waiting there
when I told you--

32:26.847 --> 32:28.782
are you seriously defending
the idea

32:28.849 --> 32:31.752
that you were kissing Jeremy?
Are you seriously
not willing to forgive me

32:31.818 --> 32:33.754
when you've done
the same thing with Karen?

32:33.820 --> 32:36.757
Oh, so we're even now?
Is that the moral to the story?

32:36.823 --> 32:39.693
At the end of the day,
that's what this marriage is?

32:39.760 --> 32:42.796
You tell me
what this marriage is.

32:48.835 --> 32:51.772
Doesn't it ever occur to you
that you are headed down

32:51.838 --> 32:54.708
the exact same path
your dad went down?

32:54.775 --> 32:57.678
Little by little,
they're pulling you in.

32:57.744 --> 32:59.713
I'm losing you.

32:59.780 --> 33:00.781
You're losing me?

33:00.847 --> 33:02.783
You're kissing Jeremy,
and you're losing me?

33:02.849 --> 33:04.818
We're losing us.

33:06.787 --> 33:08.689
You know it's true.

33:08.755 --> 33:10.691
I know when you took this job

33:10.757 --> 33:13.660
you thought you could walk
this razor's edge all the time

33:13.727 --> 33:16.663
between their values and ours,
between their family and ours,

33:16.730 --> 33:18.765
but someday, Nick, you're
gonna have to make a choice.

33:18.832 --> 33:22.803
And when that day comes, I...
I hope you choose us.

33:25.772 --> 33:27.674
You're coming, right?

33:27.741 --> 33:29.676
Lise, you're coming
to the party?

33:29.743 --> 33:31.712
I'm going for a walk.
Lisa!

33:31.778 --> 33:33.714
(Door closes)

33:33.780 --> 33:35.716
(Brian) It's because
I wouldn't do it.

33:35.782 --> 33:37.751
I wouldn't go to Ellen
and talk to her

33:37.818 --> 33:40.754
and tell her to sack up
and play Darling ball,

33:40.821 --> 33:43.757
so you disappeared my family.
I had nothing to do with it.

33:43.824 --> 33:46.760
You're full of crap.
No, I am not, actually.
If I had known events

33:46.827 --> 33:48.795
were unfolding that way
with their visa,

33:48.862 --> 33:50.797
I would have jumped
at the chance to help.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.667
If you had come to me...

33:53.734 --> 33:55.702
That's what family does.

33:55.769 --> 33:57.771
We help each other.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.775
Well, I'm sorry
I didn't talk to Ellen.

34:01.842 --> 34:03.777
If you had taken the time

34:03.844 --> 34:06.747
to let her air
