WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:04.042
(HEAVY BREATHING)

00:07.466 --> 00:10.629
MOLLY: Keep breathing.
Nice and slow.

00:12.013 --> 00:16.632
Now, the first couple shots
will show you if the sights
are off or the barrel's bent.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.473
Let me make this
realeasyforyou.

00:18.561 --> 00:21.098
The sights are off,
and the barrel's bent.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.261
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

00:24.901 --> 00:27.517
Mmm... You're off to
the left about an inch.

00:27.612 --> 00:31.321
That's it. Shoot around
the star, not at it.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.151
Yes!
Yes! You did it!

00:36.746 --> 00:38.407
I didn't.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.576
You just won your
girlfriend a teddy bear.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.830
Cool. Which one do you
think she'd like best?

00:48.049 --> 00:52.839
And then Thursday night,
this physicist is giving
a lecture in Brooklyn.

00:52.929 --> 00:56.092
It's about time travel
and the grandfather paradox.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.468
I don't know
if you're busy...
Okay, Henry. Henry.

00:58.643 --> 00:59.632
Um...

01:00.686 --> 01:03.302
Can we talk for a second?
Yeah.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.264
I'm really happy
that we've been
hanging out so much.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.273
Yeah, I like you, too.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.851
Can you put down the bear?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.319
Henry.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.694
What?

01:22.124 --> 01:23.113
(SIGHS)

01:23.876 --> 01:24.911
I can't.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.330
I know.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.249
You have a girlfriend.

01:29.423 --> 01:34.213
It's just she never
seems to want to do
anything with you.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.594
Are you crying?

01:38.391 --> 01:41.303
No, l have allergies.
lmustjust be,
like, tearing up.

01:41.394 --> 01:43.680
Henry, I think
that's blood.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.183
What? I...

02:23.728 --> 02:29.268
Thirty-five year old male
cries blood, and he's not
Vampire Bill. Go.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.149
Should we ask?
Nope.

02:33.612 --> 02:34.647
What, her?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.902
So I'm interviewing
her replacements.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.455
Thank you,
Butter Scotch.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.994
Is that a family name?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.462
How long are you gonna
be using the office
for sex games?

02:50.588 --> 02:52.374
Just so I can
plan my day.

02:52.465 --> 02:55.332
Sex? At work?
I'm not a savage.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.920
| asked for a cappuccino.
That's what this is.

03:01.349 --> 03:06.469
No, cappuccino's got
a nice, stiff foam on it.
This is wetter than... Oh...

03:07.438 --> 03:08.894
Almost slipped there.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.599
Well, thank you, Ms. Scotch,
but poor foaming's
a deal breaker.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.859
Could you ask
the next candidate
to come in?

03:14.945 --> 03:19.154
Initial exam showed
no sign of trauma or
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

03:19.283 --> 03:23.367
Lymphocytosis? ALC's in
the normal range, but it's
in the high end of normal.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.661
Please take a seat, Fawn.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.123
And tell me
what's your favorite
Woody Allen movie?

03:32.671 --> 03:33.706
Annie Hall.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.088
You're interviewing hookers
but not going to talk
to them about sex?

03:36.175 --> 03:38.461
Sex is a given.
They're hookers.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.383
Defend your choice.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.007
It's the
most popular.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.255
Oh, so close.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.140
Or, "It's a trenchant
commentary on today's mores."

03:50.231 --> 03:53.644
Or, "I needed the eggs."
Thanks for your interest.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.316
To get the gig,
a call girl...

03:56.570 --> 04:02.190
Sorry, "call woman" needs
a combination of skills that
I find useful/entertaining

04:02.326 --> 04:05.318
for the remaining 57 minutes
of the hour I pay for.

04:05.454 --> 04:09.322
Lymphocytosis works.
Maybe we should take
another look at the blood.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.870
Could also be cavernous
sinus thrombosis.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.750
Clot builds up pressure
at the base of the brain.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.955
Re-run the patient's
blood panel and get
a CT venogram of his head.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.461
See which one of you is right.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.464
How are you with
small appliance repair?

04:24.515 --> 04:27.848
MOLLY: This cavernous
sinus thing, is it dangerous?

04:28.018 --> 04:32.011
CHASE: If Henry's got it,
we can treat with a combo
of drugs and surgery.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.764
The success rate is over 70%.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.434
Do you want me to
call Amy again?
No, it's fine.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.278
Amy's his girlfriend.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.024
I'm the neighbor.
I did leave a message
at their number.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.945
Do you want to try her cell?
You'll be here for a few
more hours at least.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.291
She doesn't have one.
She worries about radiation.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.206
MOLLY: I could stop by
on my way home.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.871
She knows who I am, right?

04:55.004 --> 04:57.541
HENRY: You don't
need to, but thanks.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.842
Good luck.
Okay.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.384
Have you ever
paid for sex?

05:07.475 --> 05:11.059
Every guy who's ever seen
a Merchant Ivory movie
has paid for sex.

05:11.854 --> 05:17.019
No. ltjust seems too
demeaning to women.

05:17.151 --> 05:21.064
Given the things
you've done to women,
that seems arbitrary.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.022
You're Chi Park, right?
Who's asking?

05:25.159 --> 05:27.866
You called about
my guitar flyer.
You're Micah.

05:28.204 --> 05:33.244
This guy's selling a
1974 Gibson SG Standard
in tobacco for $1,250.

05:33.417 --> 05:37.330
Yeah, actually,
I came in to tell you
I already sold it. Sorry.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.878
Oh, uh... Thanks anyway.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.765
Blood panel results
seem pretty much the
same as before.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.510
And that guy likes you.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.178
And shut up.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.763
If I'm wrong, then why
is he coming back?

05:59.485 --> 06:03.478
My band is rehearsing
tomorrow night. You should
come by and jam with us.

06:03.572 --> 06:07.656
That sounds fun.
I'll think about it.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.324
Great. Call me.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.242
Park has a boyfriend.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.240
l'll break your face.

06:23.676 --> 06:27.134
This is the talent portion
of the interview.
Okay.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.963
You like cards,
but you can juggle.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.181
I fail to see
how this would be
a benefit to you.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.259
What if I'm busy?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.765
You got anything else?
Sure.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.443
CT showed no clots
or malformations.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.150
Park and Taub ruled out
lymphocytosis and diabetes.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.653
Well, since you have nothing
of relevance to report,

06:49.868 --> 06:53.577
I assume that you're here
to toss your panties
in the ring.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.580
Patient's got a mysterious
girlfriend he really
wants to see.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.329
She's unreachable by phone,
and the neighbor's never
even seen her.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.203
What do you think?
He's gay.

07:03.966 --> 07:09.211
I think he's a junkie.
The girlfriend is a fix.
If the guy's inhaling glue...

07:09.305 --> 07:10.465
Can you repair a blender?

07:10.556 --> 07:11.762
Can you bite me?

07:12.391 --> 07:14.803
Go search the patient's home.

07:17.730 --> 07:21.939
Well, thank you, ladies.
I've seen a lot of very
talented candidates.

07:22.026 --> 07:24.017
Got a tough decision
in the next few days.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.152
This is the part I hate.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.792
Well, it's not exactly
a crack den.

07:45.883 --> 07:49.341
Doesn't exactly look
like a woman lives
here either.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.879
"To Amy. I love you."

07:54.391 --> 07:57.975
Okay, she exists.
Doesn't mean he's
not a drug addict.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.222
It's good you're playing it
cool with House. Once he gets
a rise out of someone...

08:03.317 --> 08:06.229
I'm not crazy about
the whole hooker thing,
but I get it.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.979
Other than the fact
that it's exploitative
and dangerous for women,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.152
you get what you need
without any of the
emotional baggage.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.029
You're not seeing
anyone, I take it?

08:15.120 --> 08:19.033
I've been volunteering at
the Trenton Free Clinic.
Keeps me busy.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.416
You volunteer every night
and every weekend?

08:22.586 --> 08:23.792
No time to grab dinner?

08:23.879 --> 08:27.042
What's more important?
Making small talk over ravioli

08:27.132 --> 08:29.293
or helping people who
are less fortunate?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.678
By that rationale,
none of us should
ever eat again.

08:31.762 --> 08:35.050
Well, let'sjust say
I'm not hungry right now.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.299
Oh, God.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.182
I don't think she's breathing.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.103
You think she OD'd?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.141
That or he killed her. Pulse?

08:51.323 --> 08:52.984
No.
I'll call the coroner.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.612
I don't think that's going
to be necessary.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.030
This one works in
financial district.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.242
She can get tips.
Give you leg up in market.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.126
What is Fudgey Gonzalez?

09:06.839 --> 09:11.879
Ah. Imagine a Vanilla Gonzalez
from the other side.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.084
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

09:20.686 --> 09:24.429
I'm about to make a decision,
but there's still time for you
to sneak under the wire.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.931
My favorite Woody Allen
movie is Melinda and Melinda.

09:27.860 --> 09:32.103
Our patient is not a junkie,
but he does have a girlfriend.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.951
HENRY: I call her my
girlfriend, because
people understand that.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.415
If I explained it,
they'd just think
I was a weirdo.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.123
We're not here to
judge anyone's fetish.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.162
I'm not a pervert.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.257
It's not like I'm
more attracted to
dolls than humans.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.043
So you don't have
sex with her?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.962
It's not just about that.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.382
Does the doll talk to you?

10:02.728 --> 10:05.344
I know she's not
a real person.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.392
In a lot of ways, she's
better than a person.

10:07.483 --> 10:12.318
I can tell her things,
and she won't argue
with me or make fun of me.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.688
I come home every night,
and I know she'll be
there waiting.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.398
So is your toaster.

10:19.995 --> 10:23.738
No one in the
world has an emotional
attachment to a toaster.

10:23.832 --> 10:28.166
But a lot of people
are willing to spend
$7,000 on women like Amy.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.207
Have you ever
tried an actual...

10:31.340 --> 10:37.006
Yeah, I'm 35. I've been
in relationships. Just none
of them fulfilled me.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.258
And one day, I saw
this website, and...

10:41.016 --> 10:44.634
Maybe the perfect woman
is out there somewhere,

10:44.728 --> 10:48.721
but it's not worth going
through what it would
take to find her.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.020
Amy makes me happy.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.104
CHASE: You're sweating.
It's sort of hot in here.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.319
Not that hot.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.453
Bleeding plus
two new symptoms,
fever and neurological.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.328
CHASE: I'm not sure about
that last one. I think
he's just weird.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.293
He wasn't hallucinating.
He didn't have a
thought disorder.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.127
You don't think it's
disordered to talk to...

11:13.215 --> 11:16.582
It's not all that different
from talking to your cat
or a teddy bear.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.885
You don't have sex
with your cat or
teddy bear.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.305
If you did,
you'd probably
talk to them more.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.760
Guy loves an imaginary
being who's never going
to respond to him.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.938
He's no crazier than
millions of churchgoers.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.433
You think anything off
about any patient is
a symptom.

11:34.528 --> 11:38.988
This guy buys flowers,
real flowers, for a piece
of plastic in a dress.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.235
You know what's
really crazy?

11:41.326 --> 11:46.036
Living with a human being.
Someone with opinions
and feelings

11:46.206 --> 11:49.915
who gets mad just because
you wanna take salsa classes
with them one night a week.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.787
One night.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.335
He's just running away.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.084
He hangs out with a doll.
He never needs to fear
rejection.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.753
It's sad.
HOUSE: You do understand
the irony here.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.835
Every person in this
room has a sex doll.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.553
At least the patient
has the stones to be
honest about it.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.471
Ooh! A metaphor.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.471
What you didn't foresee
is that I actually do
have a sex doll.

12:08.562 --> 12:12.020
Your doll is your kids.
Yours is your parents.
Yours is your charity.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.723
They're all excuses
for not being in
a relationship.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.230
He's not wrong.
And you...

12:17.321 --> 12:19.482
l have meaningless sex
with random strangers.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.564
Thanks for the insight,
but I stopped that months ago.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.567
I actually had
a relationship.
With a patient.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.327
You just date
whoever happens
to cross your path.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.822
My dating is getting
in the way of my dating?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.494
HOUSE: You don't go looking
for the right person.

12:31.627 --> 12:32.992
You just shack up
with whoever's in the room.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.578
And then you get surprised
and/or divorced when it
doesn't work out.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.581
I'm surprised you haven't
asked Adams out yet.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.916
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:41.470 --> 12:42.459
Uh...

12:42.804 --> 12:44.931
For your information,
I've got a date tonight.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.846
I'll be jamming with
a cute guy and his band.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.014
You'll bail.
TAUB: He's right.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.850
The obvious solution is
for me to hand my kids
over to your parents.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.599
Can we stop trying
to argue the premise

12:52.689 --> 12:55.806
and move on to figuring out
why it is you're all
social morons?

12:55.943 --> 12:57.854
You do understand
the irony here.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.440
You're mocking us
for avoiding relationships,

13:00.530 --> 13:02.521
but you can't handle
losing your doll.

13:02.658 --> 13:07.027
You're spending all this
time and energy interviewing
for a new one.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.374
You're right. That is stupid.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.208
What about the patient?

13:17.047 --> 13:18.708
Dude's banging a sex doll,

13:18.799 --> 13:22.291
a festering cesspool
of bodily fluids and
associated bacteria.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.422
Swab her out and
find out which one.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.513
I need you.

13:28.976 --> 13:33.310
Please don't quit.
You're the only hooker
I know who can tune a piano.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.855
If it's about the money,
then I can up you to
three nights a week.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.562
I'm getting married, House.

13:41.905 --> 13:45.397
His name's Harris.
He's a certified accountant.

13:45.534 --> 13:49.322
He loves schlocky
horror movies, and
he just moved in.

13:49.538 --> 13:50.573
We're very happy.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.494
Well, you're happy.
Yeah, you're happy,

13:55.585 --> 13:58.076
because he doesn't know
about your employment history.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.419
He knows.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.248
We've talked about it,
and he accepts me
for who I am.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.999
No. He's...

14:05.429 --> 14:09.422
If he accepted who you were,
he would not be making you
give up your career.

14:09.558 --> 14:13.176
Women need
their own identities,
their own livelihoods.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.888
Otherwise, why was I smoking
all those Virginia Slims?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.940
I know this is weird for you.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.901
But you need to figure out
a way to be okay with it.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.487
I'll miss you, too.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.550
lfeel like the
stirrups are overkill.

14:54.644 --> 14:59.764
I've never done a pelvic on
a doll before. I'm unfamiliar
with the protocol.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.935
I'm pretty skeeved out
right now. I'm not gonna lie.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.315
What House said back there...
House says a lot of things.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.404
l don'tjust date
whoever shows up.

15:08.492 --> 15:13.282
I mean, I did meet women
in the hospital, but they
weren't just flings.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.828
Basically, you're explaining
why you're not gonna
ask me out.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.209
That's not what I was...

15:19.377 --> 15:22.039
Did you want me
to ask you out?

15:22.172 --> 15:27.007
Yeah. I told Park to tell
Taub to tell House to pass
you that note.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.468
It's completely
clean in there.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.137
He said he had
just bathed her.

15:35.685 --> 15:41.225
Adams, there's a swelling
beneath the skin,
a three-inch mass.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.694
Is it part of the
doll's skeleton?

15:48.240 --> 15:50.071
It feels like a tumor.

16:02.212 --> 16:05.079
CHASE: CT showed an air-filled
mass in the doll's abdomen.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.088
JESSICA: It's probablyjust
a chemical reaction.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.674
Henry left her too close
to a heating pipe
or something.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.376
This guy brushes
her hair every morning,

16:11.555 --> 16:13.716
brings home movies for
them to watch together.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.431
You think he tosses
her in a broom closet
at the end of each day?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.927
More likely than it
getting stomach cancer.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.644
How about clostridium?

16:21.731 --> 16:25.189
Bacteria got trapped
in an airtight cavity,
produced gas.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.188
Doesn't explain the
neurological issue.

16:27.279 --> 16:31.238
We can explain
that the same way we
explain the tooth fairy.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.648
Oh...

16:33.869 --> 16:35.575
I get to play Solomon.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.485
Cut the doll open.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.414
We can't just destroy
the patient's property.
That thing cost seven grand.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.703
Exactly. Ask him for consent.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.460
If he says yes,
then we get to go
hunting bacteria.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.045
If he says no,
there's no need,

16:47.132 --> 16:49.714
'cause he's crazy, and
we need a different theory.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.417
See you. Gotta go
build a temple.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.422
Okay.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.929
You're sure?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.601
It won't be able to heal
when we're done.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.812
But you think she could
tell you what's wrong with me.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.021
Yes.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.106
Okay.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.744
Should we take her
to the procedure room?

17:23.835 --> 17:27.293
It's not a "her,"
which means we can
do this anywhere.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.801
CHASE: Adams.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.385
You can know something's
not real and still love it.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.183
I think the procedure room
might be better for this.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.993
You are a horrible person.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.583
All I need is to break up
one marriage. You've
broken up three of your own.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.249
You're like
the Stephen Hawking
of killing relationships.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.668
Actually, no, Stephen Hawking
is the Stephen Hawking of...

18:12.759 --> 18:14.920
Okay, I have work to do.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.381
Your computer is off.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.633
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my stereo.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.761
Why do you assume that
marriage is better
than hooking?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.636
We don't know anything
about the guy. He could
be a serial killer.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.346
Even if that were true,
it would still be a tossup.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.228
What kind of guy
marries a hooker?

18:31.361 --> 18:33.067
Someone who hires hookers.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.981
And someone who hires
hookers is not exactly
the monogamous type.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.154
If we expose him
as a cheater...
You're a coward.

18:40.245 --> 18:44.033
Would a coward fight to
the end to save a damsel
in soon-to-be-proved distress?

18:44.124 --> 18:47.241
Absolutely.
If what he's afraid
of is other damsels.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.961
Your last relationship
failed so miserably,
you ended up in jail.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.958
Now you're clinging
to this hooker

18:53.049 --> 18:56.883
when there are about three
billion other women out there
who aren't call girls.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.918
Some of whom are
attractive and intelligent.

18:59.014 --> 19:03.257
One of whom is living
in your apartment and
is married to you.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.891
You're right.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.731
Why am I asking you for help?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.194
You shouldn't
sleep with Chase.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.235
Oh, thank God,
you got here just in time.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.407
What do you have against him?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.740
Nothing. But House has a way
of getting in people's heads.

19:28.835 --> 19:32.498
Just like last week when
he was prying into your
relationship with Chase?

19:32.589 --> 19:35.331
It was silly then,
and it's silly now.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.757
Why was it silly then?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.593
I'm not 5' 9" with
curves and flowing hair,

19:40.680 --> 19:44.093
so it's impossible
for me to get it on
with a good-looking guy?

19:44.267 --> 19:46.349
Wow. Do you resent me?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.469
You're the quirky,
hard-working sophomore,

19:49.564 --> 19:52.431
and I'm the evil cheerleader
who steals boys?

19:52.901 --> 19:54.732
If you're not getting any,
it's not my fault.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.786
Should we get the one with
the panda on it or the bird?

20:03.870 --> 20:04.859
(COOS)

20:04.954 --> 20:05.989
Good choice.

20:06.164 --> 20:10.157
Pandas eat only bamboo.
They know nothing
about cereal.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.750
Your little girl is adorable.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.583
Thanks. She keeps
me very busy.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.835
You and her mom
must be very proud.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.806
Her mother died
in childbirth.

21:06.850 --> 21:07.885
Amy!

21:09.102 --> 21:10.091
How'd it go?

21:11.146 --> 21:12.431
We're growing cultures now,

21:12.522 --> 21:15.980
but she looked clean,
and there was no
telltale smell.

21:16.067 --> 21:20.356
I'm guessing the lump was just
an air bubble that got trapped
in the mold.

21:20.530 --> 21:21.986
You bandaged her up.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.574
I threw in some stitches, too.
Just wanted to make her
look her best.

21:27.871 --> 21:28.860
(CHUCKLES)

21:29.289 --> 21:31.655

put her in her chair?

21:35.587 --> 21:37.077
Call a code!

21:45.138 --> 21:48.175
Are you looking at
the apartment with those
or the transit of Mercury?

21:48.266 --> 21:50.632
If night comes,
you will be thanking me.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.263
They are seeking heat.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.390
He's an accountant.
How late do you think
he's gonna party?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.813
I broughtjar to pee in.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.347
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:59.819 --> 22:01.605
Yeah.
JESSICA: We heard crackles
in Henry’s lungs.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.527
We diuresed him,
but he still needs oxygen.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.657
Echo shows normal
heart function. Could be high
output failure from anemia.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.904
Hematocrit was rock normal.

22:09.037 --> 22:12.325
HOUSE: What is this, mushroom?
DOMINIKA: Say mushroom,
charge two dollars.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.241
Say truffle,
charge five dollars.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.459
Is that the man who
wants to marry hooker?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.333
Probably. But he's
not the one we're after.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.707
Should we ask?
Nope.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.258
Oh! How rude of me
not to situate you.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.344
I'm doing Emily a favor.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.764
We’re gonna track her fiancé
until Dominika can seduce

22:31.851 --> 22:34.809
and expose him
as the lying cheater
I need him to be.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.057
I'm guessing she didn't
ask for this favor.

22:37.315 --> 22:40.682
You know, the noblest
gifts are the ones
we give anonymously.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.313
Crackles are non-specific.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.942
Hypoxia plus bleeding could
indicate 0/0 or some other...

22:46.032 --> 22:47.568
No neurological symptoms?

22:47.659 --> 22:49.991
/ knew your bleeding heart
would bring you around.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.034
Too bad it’s also taking
you off the market,

22:52.121 --> 22:53.657
and by market, I mean Chase.

22:54.874 --> 22:59.868
Come on, buck up, Chase.
There’s always Park. Unless...

23:00.880 --> 23:02.791
How did band practice go?
Great.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.588
Does it look like she’s lying?
Kind of.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.218
Popo needed a ride
to the doctor, and
my mother couldn't, so...

23:09.305 --> 23:11.887
You're terrified of dating,

23:11.975 --> 23:15.183
because a previous
relationship ended

23:15.395 --> 23:19.513
because your latent
rage made you vicious
in arguments, or...

23:19.607 --> 23:21.313
TAU B: Or reincarnation.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.850
In a past life she
was Anne Boleyn.
HOUSE: Interesting.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.691
Taub feels confident
enough to turn the
spotlight on himself.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.566
It’s almost as if he
wants me to ask...

23:30.827 --> 23:32.988
What's her name?
TAUB: Wendy Jacobson.

23:33.121 --> 23:36.409
Thirty three, Brown grad,
family therapist.
HOUSE: Nice choice.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.285
Since you've got
two families to therapize.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.992
First date, we didn't discuss
everything important.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.043
It was just a one-night stand.

23:43.298 --> 23:46.290
You're wrong.
I actually like her.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.207
I'm gonna see her again.
Mazel tov.

23:48.303 --> 23:53.093
Great relationships often
start with snap decisions
aimed at proving me wrong.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.470
Air bubble in the doll
could mean the silicone
is degrading.

23:56.603 --> 24:00.346
If he inhaled
some particles...
Silicone deposition.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.103
That could work.
Start him on plasmapheresis.

24:04.193 --> 24:08.106
Now, turning to Adams,

Whoa.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.762
That is awesome.

No.

that she's here.

What?

25:16.432 --> 25:18.013
I'm serious.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.846

a little strange,

25:22.271 --> 25:24.603
but she means a lot to me.

25:27.652 --> 25:32.021
I gotta get back to work.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.485
You just got here. Sit down.

Yeah, but I said that
I only had a second.

admit something.

I've asked out since then.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.713
I'm not used to explaining.
I panicked.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.754
Which I regret,
because now that I've
gotten to know you,

26:39.557 --> 26:41.172

28:25.955 --> 28:27.786
(SCREAMING)

28:29.458 --> 28:30.447
Ah!

28:34.338 --> 28:35.373
(SCREAMING)

28:35.464 --> 28:36.590
Pushing lorazepam.

28:36.966 --> 28:40.629
If it wasn't neurological
before, it sure is now.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.376
Right upper quadrant's
distended.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.258
He's hallucinating
because his liver is failing.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.266
TAUB: Elevated transaminases
confirm liver failure.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.393
We'll have to put him
on the transplant list
in a couple of days.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.861
It's clearly
not the silicone.
Could be vasculitis.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.477
Serologies were negative.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.568
Yeah. If you want
Adams to hear,

29:03.659 --> 29:06.822
you might wanna not stand
so conspicuously far away.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.034
CHASE: I'm making coffee.

29:08.289 --> 29:12.077
And sometimes
I date co-workers. Like
everyone else on the planet.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.752
Hepatic fibrosis.
If it damaged his platelets,
it'd explain the bleeding.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.545
Unexpected. I actually
thought you might
agree with my theory.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.373
Because that would mean
nothing's your fault.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.797
You fell into relationships
based on proximity.
Of course they'd fail.

29:23.971 --> 29:28.340
But I guess I was wrong.
You picked perfect women.
You just screwed it up.

29:29.310 --> 29:33.428
How about all five
of us sleep together
and the $7,000 sex doll?

29:33.564 --> 29:35.680
It'll solve all of
our hang-ups.
$7,000?

29:35.816 --> 29:40.401
Adams suggests that
we all sleep together,
and your issue is high prices.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.030
Pretty sure she was joking.
HOUSE: Yes.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.277
I'm 99% sure that
you're right, but I would
never forgive myself...

29:45.368 --> 29:48.326
Those dolls are only $5,000.
He must have had it
customized somehow.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.866
Oh, like you didn't
check the website.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.702
Guess we don't need to ask
how your dating life is going.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.040
I was curious.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.126
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't
cause difficulty breathing.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.709
It would if liver failure
opened pulmonary AV shunts.

30:04.887 --> 30:09.802
Fibrosis fits. Start the
patient on steroids. And find
out how he pimped his ride.

30:10.893 --> 30:14.056
Why?
Because I don't
know the answer.

30:25.866 --> 30:26.901
Hey.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.654
FoosbaH?
Can't.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.656
Marriage to destroy.
Okay.

30:33.416 --> 30:37.000
"Okay," as in
passive-aggressive
reverse psychology?

30:37.086 --> 30:39.247
Or as in depressed
resignation?

30:40.589 --> 30:43.376
"Okay," as in
I changed my mind.

30:43.801 --> 30:44.916
Expand.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.923
It's morally reprehensible
and bound to fail,

30:48.014 --> 30:51.097
but in a weird way,
it's a step forward,
this thing with Emily.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.925
Contract.
It's real without
being real.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.682
It's a long term relationship
that can't actually hurt you.

30:56.772 --> 31:00.856
It's a stepping stone.
It means you want more.

31:03.279 --> 31:06.112
So passive-aggressive
reverse psychology. Got it.

31:13.205 --> 31:17.790
HOUSE: Try not to come on too
strong, okay. Just get to know
him a little. Ease into it.

31:17.877 --> 31:20.243
Why would I ease?

31:20.421 --> 31:23.709
True, you could just
walk up and stick your
hand down his pants,

31:23.799 --> 31:25.380
but I've heard
there's a middle step.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.424
Men want to have sex.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.794
Not with crazy people.

31:29.889 --> 31:33.302
Well, yes, a lot with
crazy people, but not
that kind of crazy.

31:33.434 --> 31:34.890
Well, yeah, that
kind of crazy, but...

31:35.061 --> 31:37.973
They don't care how crazy
if she looks like me.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.762
Okay. Easing.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.812
(ON EARPIECE) Hi.
Hey.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.656
I’m Jennifer, new to
Marketing Department.

31:51.744 --> 31:55.328
Harris.
Accounts receivable.
Interesting.

31:55.456 --> 31:58.539
Do you want to get out
of here and have sex?

31:58.626 --> 31:59.911
Sure.

32:01.629 --> 32:04.962
You know, I’ve got 45 minutes
left on my lunch break.
Mmm-hmm.

32:05.049 --> 32:06.289
Where do you want to go?

32:06.425 --> 32:11.044
Off to a place where
men don't cheat on
the women they love.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.671
You're not invited,
obviously.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.511
Cheating? What are
you talking about?

32:17.728 --> 32:21.812
Well, I hope you're
speaking out of some deep
kind of moral relativism.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.981
Becauseif”
Who are you people?

32:25.319 --> 32:26.684
You're not Emily's fiancé.

32:27.488 --> 32:28.898
Emily's my sister.

32:35.913 --> 32:38.871
We called the company
that made Amy.

32:39.834 --> 32:43.873
They said they modeled her
after some photos
you sent them.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.041
Who is she?

32:52.930 --> 32:56.297
We met last Christmas.
She's a yoga instructor.

32:58.352 --> 33:03.563
Totally different from me.
She loved Chopin,
hated Indian food.

33:06.694 --> 33:11.188
She changed my entire
life for 17 weeks.

33:17.830 --> 33:18.910
My husband cheated on me.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.878
With a girl he met on
the plane coming back
from our honeymoon.

33:31.218 --> 33:34.506
It's not easy to get
past things like that.

33:38.934 --> 33:42.927
She wasn't unfaithful.
She didn't betray me.
Shejust”

33:45.065 --> 33:47.602
Just wasn't in love with me.

33:53.699 --> 33:57.612
I know Amy's not going
to break your heart,

33:57.953 --> 34:00.820
but she's also not going
to change your life.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.631
That light's bright.

34:12.843 --> 34:15.425
Sorry. What's happening to me?

34:15.804 --> 34:18.591
Is your neck stiff?
Yeah.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.136
I think you have meningitis.

34:22.811 --> 34:27.475
I'm not leaving
the business.
I'm just leaving you.

34:29.318 --> 34:30.649
I didn't want you
to feel bad.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.234
So, let me get
this straight.

34:32.321 --> 34:36.530
I'm being dumped by
a hooker who's worried
about my feelings.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.321
You're married.
Half your clients
are married.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.954
And you're a hooker.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.453
My other guys sneak around.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.668
But you'll take me into
the bedroom while your
wife's in the next room.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.913
That's just mean.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.790
Oh, thank God.

34:50.881 --> 34:53.042
The marriage, it's a sham.

34:54.301 --> 34:57.384
The only real thing about it
is the Green Card she's
gonna get at the end of it.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.012
So, if you wanna get
the meter running...

35:01.225 --> 35:02.886
It's still mean.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.851
It's not a marriage.
It's a felony.

35:08.983 --> 35:10.894
I've seen how she looks
at you when you're together.

35:11.527 --> 35:14.018
Trust me,
she likes you.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.236
And I've seen how
you look at her.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.911
JESSICA: Fever’s up to 105.
He’s not responding to meds.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.874
At this rate,
he'll be dead by the time
we get the cultures back.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.956
Spinal fluid was full of
white cells. Meningitis
could be carcinomatous.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.673
Cytology showed nothing.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.172
CHASE: An amoebic
infection would cause
fever and meningitis.

35:39.263 --> 35:42.175
But not liver failure.
It could if he had a clot.

35:42.266 --> 35:44.678
TAUB: How would amoebas
get past his cribriform plate?

35:44.768 --> 35:47.145
He went swimming
in a frozen lake
in New Jersey?

35:50.607 --> 35:53.019
Adams said his ex-girlfriend
was a yoga instructor.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.146
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.895
Yoga nuts are way
more likely to be into
alternative medicine.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.732
He had this weird little
teapot in his house.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.491
What was it like?

36:03.787 --> 36:07.575
I don't know.
Little, weird, teapot-ish.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.416
Was it like that?
Yeah.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.762
You think he drank
some sort of toxic herbal tea?

36:20.929 --> 36:25.263
Yes, if by tea you
mean salted tap water,

36:25.476 --> 36:27.762
and by drank you mean
poured up his nose.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.188
His girlfriend didn't
just leave him with
a broken heart.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.929
She left him with a neti pot.

36:32.107 --> 36:37.397
It's an Indian method
of clearing the sinuses
during allergy season,

36:37.488 --> 36:38.898
also known as now.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.777
HOUSE: With distilled
water, it can act as
a snot-flushing system.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.577
With tap water, it can act
as an amoeba-delivery system

36:46.663 --> 36:48.119
to the fluids
around the brain.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.947
Start him on metronidazole.

36:50.042 --> 36:54.456
If he's lucky, he'll get
to see his plastic children
walk down the aisle.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.293
My neck feels much better.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.551
Your fever's gone,
and your liver function's
almost back to normal.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.098
You should be able
to go home soon.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.892
I'm going to have some
hospital bills to pay.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.892
I don't suppose
used sex dolls go
for anything online?

37:14.983 --> 37:15.972
(CHUCKLES)

37:16.944 --> 37:18.150
Dr. Adams?

37:20.823 --> 37:22.609
Can I get your email?

37:23.409 --> 37:24.694
What for?

37:26.370 --> 37:29.658
I just thought
maybe we could see
each other again.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.085
I can't.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.372
No, I know it's
a professionalism thing,

37:36.463 --> 37:38.704
but you won't be my doctor
when I get out of here.

37:38.799 --> 37:42.041
It's not that. It's...
What is it?

37:42.136 --> 37:43.967
You said I should
change my life.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.841
You were talking
about yourself, too.
I know you were.

37:46.932 --> 37:50.550
Henry. I think you
should ask Molly out.

37:55.858 --> 37:58.065
I should have known
this would happen.

37:58.152 --> 38:03.363
You're a good guy, Henry.
You deserve more than a doll.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.656
Promise me you'll keep trying.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.030
Okay.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.376
Date tonight?
No.

38:28.140 --> 38:31.382
So she can't deal.
There's someone
out there who can.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.974
You just got to find her.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.095
I'd love to prove
House wrong, but...

38:37.483 --> 38:39.895
I ruined my marriage,
broke two people's hearts,

38:39.985 --> 38:45.150
had two kids who are always
gonna wonder why I didn't
love their mommy enough.

38:45.449 --> 38:49.067
It's better if I just
focus on what I do have.

38:52.956 --> 38:54.492
Give that band guy a call.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.829
I'm not that good at guitar.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.794
Or flirting or small talk?

39:03.091 --> 39:08.176
I'm not as pretty as Adams.
I have stuffy clothes,
and I hate my hair.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.596
Adams works 80 hours a week
fixing bunions on hobos,

39:11.683 --> 39:14.971
because she can't face
getting to know someone new.

39:15.521 --> 39:19.389
Trust me, you find
a boyfriend, she'll
be the jealous one.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.271
See you tomorrow.

39:30.244 --> 39:31.233
Do you

39:34.164 --> 39:36.371
want to get a drink?

39:36.792 --> 39:39.033
To annoy Park?
Or to prove House wrong?

39:40.295 --> 39:41.284
Oh, I...

39:41.922 --> 39:45.289
It's just I think
it's time for a change.

39:48.512 --> 39:51.879
I don't really think
that's a good idea
for me right now.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.386
House has a way
of getting in
people's heads.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.605
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:14.788 --> 40:17.450
No, Mom. I'm still at work.
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:18.333 --> 40:21.541
I'll be home in
a couple of hours.
Love you, too.

40:32.389 --> 40:36.553
Ready? One, two,
three, four.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.019
(SINGING)

40:51.867 --> 40:54.199
(SINGING)

40:59.541 --> 41:00.530
(SONG CONTINUES)

41:55.430 --> 41:56.715
I fixed blender.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.761
So I see.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.930
I had fun seducing
hooker's fake fiance.

42:04.106 --> 42:05.596
Sorry it didn't work.

42:06.233 --> 42:10.442
Yeah. I thought
I'd take a break from
the whole hooker thing.

42:12.864 --> 42:16.777
I think maybe you need
milkshake. ls pistachio.

42:17.953 --> 42:18.942
(GIGGLES)

42:30.132 --> 42:34.091
Well, I'm going to go to bed.
See you tomorrow.
