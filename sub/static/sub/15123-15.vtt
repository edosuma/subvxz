WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.938
(chuckles) Do you have
to draw so lightly?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.274
It tickles.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.542
I don't have to,
but I like watching you squirm.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.511
Your cute little butt wiggles.
(chuckles)

00:10.578 --> 00:12.946
VIRGINIA: Ooh, look who's
finally back from his date.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.348
Hey, you didn't tell us

00:14.415 --> 00:16.217
you and Sabrina were gonna have
your first sleepover.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.852
Spill the details, buddy.
Is she a screamer?

00:18.919 --> 00:20.288
She looks like a screamer.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.290
I wouldn't know;
she wants us to wait

00:22.356 --> 00:23.957
until we've dated
at least a month.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.059
Apparently, it's a rule of hers.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.327
That's crazy.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.861
You've already waited a year
and a half.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.964
You got to hop on that horse
and ride, buddy. Giddyap!

00:31.031 --> 00:31.965
Life is short.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.068
Not true. Life is long.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.436
Ridiculously long.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.004
VIRGINIA:
So, what happened instead?

00:37.071 --> 00:39.907
Give us
all the young love gossip.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.675
Ordered a pizza,
watched a movie.

00:41.742 --> 00:42.376
Was it a dirty movie?

00:42.443 --> 00:43.611
No. The Sixth Sense.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.579
I totally didn't realize
Bruce Willis was dead.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.614
Me, neither.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.149
I knew he was old.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.483
MAW MAW:
Watched a movie?

00:49.550 --> 00:50.918
Now that you guys are finally
together,

00:50.984 --> 00:54.021
I thought we would at least get
some good stories out of it.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.556
Yeah, I'm with Maw Maw.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.558
This was way more interesting
when you were chasing after her.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.793
Maybe getting you two together
was a mistake.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.600
Burt, you're
the best tailor in town!

01:07.935 --> 01:09.170
Jimmy, I got blue.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.938
You want me to hook you up?

01:11.004 --> 01:12.306
Yeah, I showered yesterday.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.443
I guess I could use a tune-up.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.510
(sighs)

01:17.811 --> 01:19.647
Whoo!

01:19.713 --> 01:20.948
* Here we go *

01:21.014 --> 01:24.252
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! *

01:28.122 --> 01:30.324
(gunfire, sirens on TV)

01:33.961 --> 01:35.863
They're just sitting out there.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.298
Not even touching her.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.933
This far into our second date,
I had you pregnant.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.235
What cassette is that?

01:41.302 --> 01:42.936
I don't know; there's no label.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.138
I found it under the bed.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.973
I'm hoping
it's that love jams mix

01:46.039 --> 01:47.541
I made in the summer of '88.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.311
I can't remember the last time
we did it to "Rock Me, Amadeus."

01:50.378 --> 01:52.446
See? This is what I love
about life.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.249
Just when you think it's gonna
be a normal Tuesday night

01:55.316 --> 01:57.985
with nothing good on TV--
bam, Mystery cassette!

01:58.051 --> 01:59.487
Keep an ear out and make sure

01:59.553 --> 02:01.389
Sabrina doesn't come down
the hall.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.990
She thinks
I'm getting a blanket.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.825
What are you doing?

02:04.892 --> 02:06.760
I'm having some issues
with the Chinese food.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.229
(extended farting)

02:09.863 --> 02:11.865
Oh... my... God.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.236
How many farts
have you been holding in?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.804
Sounded
like seven.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.172
(squeaky fart)
Eight.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.007
Jimmy, that is not healthy.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.309
BURT: No, that
is not healthy.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.676
You can only squeeze that
little muscle down there

02:22.743 --> 02:23.911
so many times
in your life.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.646
You don't want to wear
it out in your 20s.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.681
No, I mean it's not healthy
for the relationship.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.717
You need to be yourself.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.185
Mom, but she's perfect.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.287
I still can't believe
I actually got her.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.588
You're just delaying
the uneditable.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.857
If she doesn't like you
for who you are,

02:36.924 --> 02:39.026
there isn't any reason
for you to be together.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.694
You've got to be yourself.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.862
Ah...

02:41.929 --> 02:43.397
Done.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.666
I'm gonna go look for some
batteries for the boom box.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.101
(blowing air)

02:48.168 --> 02:50.371
Whoo! Good Lord!

02:50.438 --> 02:52.673
You're holding them in?
Shh!

02:52.740 --> 02:56.009
For crying out loud,
just fart in front of him.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.745
I can't.
He thinks I'm perfect.

02:57.811 --> 02:58.846
It's a lot of pressure.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.048
Sorry I took so long.
I couldn't find... Oh!

03:01.114 --> 03:02.416
Your mother farted.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.051
Hey, you know, I think
we could get some batteries

03:04.117 --> 03:05.953
out of Hope's...
Oh! Good gravy leg!

03:06.019 --> 03:06.820
What is that?

03:06.887 --> 03:07.755
It was Virginia.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.258
(sniffing)
That is not Virginia.

03:11.058 --> 03:11.959
All right, that's it.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.960
Burt, go crack a window.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.928
You two, sit down.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.929
We need to chat.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.097
(doll chirps)

03:17.164 --> 03:18.966
And that's why Burt and I have

03:19.032 --> 03:19.933
been together for 25 years.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.569
Because we're not afraid

03:21.635 --> 03:23.771
to be ourselves in front
of each other.

03:23.837 --> 03:24.805
That's six.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.440
See you in the bedroom.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.676
Ooh, you're a little bean dippy.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.378
Want me to stop
and brush on my way back?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.980
Nah. I'll just eat
some bean dip.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.014
Cool. See what I mean?

03:34.081 --> 03:36.584
We're not afraid
to be ourselves.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.151
You're making too big
a deal out of this.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.420
We just held
in some gas.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.954
You got to get everything out

03:41.021 --> 03:42.222
in the open. Trust me.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.258
What if you guys get naked
for the first time,

03:44.325 --> 03:46.627
and you discover she has--

03:46.694 --> 03:48.562
I don't know-- inverted nipples.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.097
Oh, my God.
What?

03:50.163 --> 03:51.365
It's a real thing;
I saw it on TV.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.634
Sweet girl, very religious,

03:53.701 --> 03:56.036
which kind of threw me because
if you're so churchy,

03:56.103 --> 03:57.371
why are you showing Dr. Oz

03:57.438 --> 03:59.440
how you can put a jellybean
in your nipple hole?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.809
Anyway, my point is,
the longer Sabrina hides

04:01.875 --> 04:02.810
her inverted nipples,

04:02.876 --> 04:05.646
the weirder it's gonna be
in one month

04:05.713 --> 04:06.780
when you finally see 'em.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.316
Mom, stop it.
Please, just stop it.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.718
Wait. I'm sorry.
Did you tell your mom
about my one-month rule?

04:10.784 --> 04:13.321
No. Yes. Maw Maw wanted to know
if you were a screamer, and I...

04:13.387 --> 04:15.155
What?
Why are you doing this to me?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.757
I'm just being myself, Jimmy.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.892
And you know what,
you still love me, don't you?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.093
No. No, I don't.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.396
("Rock Me Amadeus" on boom box)
BURT: Virginia?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
Oh, I got to
get back there.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.500
We have a one-song
foreplay agreement.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.604
Can I just make
one general apology

04:30.671 --> 04:32.005
for every inappropriate
thing they've said today,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.107
or do I need to
go down the list

04:34.174 --> 04:36.043
and relive each
humiliating moment?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.010
Don't worry about it.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.212
I mean, the truth is,
is that she's right.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.416
Oh, okay, and I'm
totally fine with that.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.985
Who's to say nipples should go
one way or the other way?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.053
No, my nipples poke out.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.621
I just mean she's right

04:47.688 --> 04:50.591
about us being ourselves,
about being open.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.993
I just... I want us to be able
to be who we really are

04:53.060 --> 04:55.763
and accept each other,
warts and all.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.697
I'm all for that.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.131
Depending on where
the warts are.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.867
That's just a saying;
there's-there's no actual...

04:59.933 --> 05:02.836
I knew that.
I don't want to
have the same kind

05:02.903 --> 05:04.605
of relationship
I had with Wyatt.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.840
He always wanted me to be
someone that I wasn't,

05:06.907 --> 05:08.976
and I just want
to be myself.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.678
And I want you to be yourself.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.945
Thank you.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.881
So, starting tomorrow,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.550
I'm going to stop
taking my meds.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.888
That's great.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.955
Hm.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.924
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.058
(clattering)

05:26.326 --> 05:27.995
(toy siren wailing)
Yes!

05:28.061 --> 05:30.063
Help is on the way!

05:38.238 --> 05:40.574
What does that even mean?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.075
"She's off her meds."

05:42.142 --> 05:43.444
I don't know exactly.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.878
At first, I was hoping
it was just a saying.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.246
Like when she
said she had warts.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.115
She has warts?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.083
Gross. I hate warts.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.785
Oh, I hate her. I hate her!

05:51.852 --> 05:54.722
She was on our couch;
we got to burn the couch.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.757
I can deal with warts;
it's nothing you can't solve

05:56.824 --> 05:59.059
with some dry ice and
a good pair of scissors.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.093
But I want to know

06:00.160 --> 06:01.595
about these meds.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.096
Is she crazy or what?

06:03.163 --> 06:04.097
I don't know.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.133
Apparently, she's
taking mood stabilizers

06:06.199 --> 06:07.535
that she got from Wyatt's dad,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.437
which is weird
'cause he's a dentist.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.838
This might be a deal breaker.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
You might need to break up
with her.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.874
What are you talking about?

06:13.941 --> 06:16.076
You're the one who said
we needed to be ourselves.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.545
I can't break
up with her

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
just 'cause she showed me
who she really is.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.649
Of course you can,
that's the whole reason

06:21.715 --> 06:23.016
for being yourselves
in front of each other.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.785
So you can find out
all the weird stuff

06:24.852 --> 06:27.921
and decide if you could
put up with it or not.

06:27.988 --> 06:28.956
Wilfred and I had

06:29.022 --> 06:30.891
the exact right mix
of weirdness.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.694
He liked to put raisins
on his pizza,

06:33.761 --> 06:38.031
and I couldn't have an orgasm
unless he choked me.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.735
And as a couple,

06:41.802 --> 06:46.073
they decided that
they were cool with that.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.641
Just like
me and your dad.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.411
We know every weird thing
there is about each other,

06:51.479 --> 06:52.946
and we've decided
we could tolerate it.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.415
That's what love is.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.651
Mm-hmm.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.553
What do you mean
you shave your feet?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.455
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.156
Easy.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.392
When I was 14, my feet
started to get very hairy.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.428
At first I was totally psyched;
I thought I was Teen Wolf.

07:08.496 --> 07:12.866
But the girls at the
pool did not treat me
like Michael J. Fox.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.568
I've been shaving
them ever since.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.069
Do you think that's weird?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.104
Yeah, I think it's weird.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.472
I think it's really weird.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.406
Damn.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.307
What?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.408
Virginia doesn't know.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.910
I never had the
guts to tell her,

07:22.976 --> 07:24.144
and now she's
talking about how

07:24.211 --> 07:26.013
we know all of each
other's secrets and stuff.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.715
It's killing me.
Should I tell her?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.217
I don't think you
should have told me.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.152
Does this mayo seem bad to you?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.158
Uh, it's right on the edge.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.494
Look, just because
I think it's weird

07:40.561 --> 07:43.196
doesn't mean she's
gonna think it's weird.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.099
But you don't want
to risk it by telling her.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.168
I got an idea.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.573
Oh, maybe that mayo is bad.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.575
No, I was just thinking
about your feet.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.447
(knocking)

08:00.514 --> 08:03.050
That sounds like
Andrew's knock.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.885
(chuckles)

08:04.952 --> 08:06.820
Ah, hey, Andrew.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.421
Hello, Burt.
I was wondering

08:08.488 --> 08:09.823
if you happened to
have some shaving cream

08:09.890 --> 08:11.358
and a razor I could borrow.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.360
I believe I do
have those items.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.663
Let me go get them for you.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.167
Heading to work?
Yeah.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.535
Without those pills,
Sabrina could have

08:21.602 --> 08:23.837
a whole different personality,
or two.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.573
They're just mood stabilizers.

08:25.639 --> 08:29.710
I'm sure she's not going to turn
into Dr. Heckle or Mr. Jeckle.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.882
Here we go.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.516
Those items you
needed for shaving.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.218
I even brought a
bowl of hot water

08:38.285 --> 08:40.688
in case you want to save some
time and shave right here.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.955
How considerate of you.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.224
I think I'll take you up
on this offer.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.162
(cooing)

08:52.800 --> 08:55.302
What are you, uh...

08:55.368 --> 08:56.770
What are you doing there?

08:56.837 --> 08:57.871
I'm shaving my feet.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.707
I have fairly hairy feet,

08:59.773 --> 09:01.875
and it's my preference
to keep them smooth.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.410
It's actually
quite common

09:03.476 --> 09:05.779
among men.
That's interesting.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.181
Unexpected maybe, but I
don't think it's strange.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.617
Do you think it's
strange, Virginia?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.151
No. Women shave their legs.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
If men want to shave their feet,
they should shave their feet.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.155
Makes no difference to me.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.492
Well, it looks like I'm done.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.194
Take care, buddy.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.966
Ha.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.901
You want to hear
something funny?

09:27.968 --> 09:30.437
Is it funnier than
what just happened?

09:30.503 --> 09:34.141
Because what the hell was that?!

09:34.207 --> 09:35.609
Are you kidding me?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.810
He shaves his feet?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.679
Burt, he shaves his feet.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.780
His feet!

09:39.847 --> 09:41.314
Just the top part.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.685
And how gross is it that
his feet are so hairy

09:44.752 --> 09:46.887
that he has to shave them?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.856
That's probably why
his wife left him.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.791
And why would he
tell us about it?

09:50.858 --> 09:52.559
Oh, I don't know.
It's all very puzzling.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.629
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to look him in the face again.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.330
Oh! Which is bad,
'cause I'm not gonna

09:57.397 --> 09:59.833
be able to look at
his crazy-ass feet again either.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.806
I'm sorry, what was that funny
thing you wanted to tell me?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.841
Oh, uh, uh...

10:07.908 --> 10:10.644
A priest walks
into a barbershop,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.612
with a parrot
on his shoulder...

10:12.680 --> 10:14.047
Never mind.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
It's never gonna be as funny
as Andrew shaving his feet!

10:16.083 --> 10:18.551
Shaves his feet!
(laughing)

10:18.618 --> 10:19.853
Unbelievable!

10:19.920 --> 10:22.823
(forced laughter) I know.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.229
Shaves his feet!

10:31.298 --> 10:33.400
(humming softly)

10:36.236 --> 10:37.771
(squeals, sputtering)

10:37.838 --> 10:39.339
Jimmy, I'm not just gonna,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.675
like, start acting crazy if
that's what you're waiting for.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.810
What?

10:42.876 --> 10:43.844
No, I wasn't...

10:43.911 --> 10:45.245
I don't even...

10:45.312 --> 10:48.281
(clears throat) What exactly
is going to happen?

10:48.348 --> 10:49.382
Look, Wyatt was just...

10:49.449 --> 10:52.119
He was uncomfortable with
the kind of person I was

10:52.185 --> 10:53.721
without the pills,
that's all.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.823
You know, but I'm different,
but I'm more me.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.224
You're gonna like it.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.459
Trust me, I'm not crazy.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.162
I know.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.200
(sputtering)

11:07.267 --> 11:09.402
JIMMY: Since the number-one
thing crazy people tend to say

11:09.469 --> 11:11.571
is "I'm not crazy,"
I wasn't convinced yet.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.674
So, over the next few days,
I kept an eye on her.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.444
At first, she didn't seem
any different at all.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.048
But then I started
to see some slight changes.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.183
* *

11:27.921 --> 11:30.490
She's a little more fun
at work.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.760
She was also a little
more impulsive.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.461
Hey, lady,
I like that hat.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.729
Hey, get in.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.563
We're giving you a ride.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.131
Oh, my God,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.600
let's give a ride to anyone
who we see who's wearing a hat.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.902
Wassup!

11:41.969 --> 11:44.604
Which was actually
a lot of fun.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.239
I want doughnuts.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.108
Who wants doughnuts?

11:48.175 --> 11:48.809
Doughnuts it is.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.077
(whooping)

11:50.143 --> 11:51.244
And if something
was on her mind,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.612
she wasn't afraid
to spit it out.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.881
All right,
Maw Maw,

11:53.947 --> 11:55.048
I've got to know.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.784
How'd you lose your virginity?

11:56.850 --> 11:57.684
Don't leave out any detail.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.419
I want to know everything.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.021
It all started one night

12:01.088 --> 12:05.225
in the rumble seat
of a 1939 Packard.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.227
All in all,
she wasn't that different.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.897
If anything,
she was just more thorough.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.832
And since we always liked her,

12:11.899 --> 12:14.167
more of her was even more fun.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.336
* *

12:17.470 --> 12:21.975
And then the four of us
put our clothes back on,

12:22.042 --> 12:24.211
put the horse
back in the stable

12:24.277 --> 12:27.815
and agreed never
to speak of it again.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.519
Well, it's probably
my favorite Christmas memory.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.358
JIMMY:
But the best part
of Sabrina being off her meds

12:38.425 --> 12:41.394
was her one-month rule
didn't exist.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.433
(sighs) That was fun.
That was very fun.

12:46.499 --> 12:50.503
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, I'm getting
another blanket.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.638
It gets kind of cold in here.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.740
There's a hole in the wall
behind the dresser.

12:53.807 --> 12:58.278
I usually shove a sock in, but I
needed the sock yesterday, so...

13:00.147 --> 13:02.615
We should probably
talk about this.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.917
Okay. Are you robbing me?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.386
(sighs) When I was six,

13:06.453 --> 13:08.856
a spider crawled into my ear
while I was sleeping,

13:08.922 --> 13:10.757
and, uh, it laid eggs.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.125
My mother was a Buddhist,

13:12.192 --> 13:13.827
and she wouldn't let me kill
them, and it was awful.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.562
So I do the...

13:15.628 --> 13:16.930
So you use the panty hose

13:16.997 --> 13:18.999
to keep the baby spiders
in your head?

13:19.066 --> 13:20.267
No, no, no, no.
They're gone, they're gone.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.669
I'm just terrified
it's gonna happen again.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.372
And the meds were keeping
the fear away, and now that

13:25.438 --> 13:26.673
I'm not taking them,

13:26.739 --> 13:30.443
I've just gotten a little bit
obsessed with spiders.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.880
And with this on my head,
I feel safer.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.215
And, look... (inhales)
I could totally breathe,

13:35.282 --> 13:36.850
so there's very little downside.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.085
Ha, ha.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.719
Oh, God, you think
this is so weird.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.054
Wyatt thought
it was weird, too.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.522
That's why he had his dad
give me all the pills.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.557
This is so weird!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.493
No, no.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.928
I mean, it makes
total sense.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.997
No, it's not weird at all.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.232
Really?
Oh, my God.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.266
Hey, listen, you know what?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.868
If you could not tell anybody.

13:54.935 --> 13:55.936
This is just...

13:56.003 --> 13:57.004
It's a embarrassing.

13:57.070 --> 13:57.971
Of course not.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.406
I would never say anything.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.875
But I think you think
it's worse than it is.

14:01.942 --> 14:02.876
It's not weird at all.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.378
Thank you.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.387
Good night.
Yeah.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.560
(mouths "Oh, my God!")

14:25.532 --> 14:26.733
(yawning)

14:26.799 --> 14:28.268
What are you
doing awake?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.904
(sighs) Every time your father
gets up to pee,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.605
I realize I'm thirsty.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.008
In two hours, I'll get up
to pee, and he'll be thirsty.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.210
It's a vicious cycle.

14:38.946 --> 14:39.812
(doorknob rattling)

14:39.879 --> 14:40.981
(grunting)

14:41.048 --> 14:42.649
One minute!

14:42.715 --> 14:46.819
Open up! This is my last pair
of clean pajamas.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.588
Oh, what are you
doing up?

14:48.655 --> 14:49.556
Uh, nothing.

14:49.622 --> 14:53.360
Sabrina... she just...
Never mind.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.861
What happened?
(gasps) She's off her meds.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.529
Did she do something crazy?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.897
I'm not allowed
to talk about it.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.632
Jimmy...

15:00.968 --> 15:02.435
Did she hurt you?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.037
No.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.038
Hey, what's up?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.373
Sabrina did something crazy,

15:06.439 --> 15:07.840
and Jimmy won't tell me
what it is.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.142
Oh, yeah?
It must be good.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.577
Come on, what is it?

15:10.643 --> 15:11.444
All right, fine.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.180
But you guys
can't say anything.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.618
She sleeps with a pair
of panty hose on her head.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.088
Excuse me?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.991
Are the pantyhose
still on her legs?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.692
No. She's terrified
of spiders,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.427
and she's worried they're
going to crawl into her ear

15:27.494 --> 15:29.696
and lay eggs in her head
while she's sleeping.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.164
(laughing)

15:31.231 --> 15:33.500
Pantyhose on her head.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.835
Hey, we should call her
"pantyhose head."

15:35.902 --> 15:37.770
You're not calling her anything;
you're not supposed to know.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.206
Does this happen a lot?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.674
This... spiders-crawling-
into-people's-heads thing?

15:41.741 --> 15:44.711
One Web site I found
says it's an urban legend.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.980
Then it must be true.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.450
Look, just don't say
anything about it.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.353
If she's afraid
of spiders,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.088
she's sleeping
in the wrong house.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.823
This place is so
full of spiders,

15:56.889 --> 15:58.225
I've named
a couple of them.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.227
I ran into Arlo last week
in the hallway

16:00.293 --> 16:05.265
with his three kids
and his wife, uh... oh...

16:05.332 --> 16:06.833
I can never remember her name.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.435
(sighs)

16:27.820 --> 16:29.056
(alarm buzzing)

16:29.122 --> 16:30.457
(buzzing stops)

16:32.125 --> 16:32.992
Morning.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.361
Morning.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.965
Hey.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.968
(sighs) Hey.
Is Jimmy here?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.070
Oh, yeah, he's around.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.104
But don't-don't ring the bell.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.305
Virginia's taking a nap.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.474
Said she couldn't
sleep last night.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.912
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.047
(screams)

16:54.114 --> 16:55.948
Okay, calm down.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.016
I'm not in any danger.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.218
(screaming)

16:58.285 --> 16:59.486
I did some research,
and this is a way

16:59.552 --> 17:01.454
for you to overcome your fear.
(screaming louder)

17:01.521 --> 17:03.556
Once you realize
that I'm okay...

17:03.623 --> 17:04.691
(screaming)

17:04.757 --> 17:06.626
...you'll see there's nothing
to be afraid of.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.994
(screaming)

17:08.061 --> 17:09.096
What in the world...?

17:09.162 --> 17:12.532
(screaming in horror)

17:12.599 --> 17:14.667
Okay, guys, if you could
please stop screaming,

17:14.734 --> 17:16.469
I think you're starting to freak
the spiders out a little bit.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.870
Why do you have pantyhose
on your head?

17:17.937 --> 17:20.140
Because Jimmy told me all
about your stupid phobia,

17:20.207 --> 17:21.741
and now I can't sleep
without worrying

17:21.808 --> 17:24.010
I'm going to wake up with
a head full of spiders.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.245
Oh, you told her?!

17:25.312 --> 17:27.114
You told her
when I asked you not to?!

17:27.180 --> 17:28.615
She made me.

17:28.681 --> 17:32.018
Seriously, you guys really need
to keep your voices down.

17:32.085 --> 17:32.952
Can you get this
one on the...

17:33.019 --> 17:34.621
(both screaming)

17:34.687 --> 17:35.822
Stop screaming.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.889
(screaming)

17:36.956 --> 17:38.625
What the hell is...?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.560
Don't look at me!

17:40.627 --> 17:42.195
God, I can't believe
you told her!

17:42.262 --> 17:44.864
And they're biting...
They're biting me!

17:44.931 --> 17:46.433
(Jimmy groaning)

17:52.205 --> 17:53.606
He's going to be fine.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.742
There is just some swelling
that will go down

17:55.808 --> 17:56.776
within a few days.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.111
If you want to see him,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.846
he's in bed number three.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.181
Thank you.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.918
Hey.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.087
Hey. Is it bad?

18:08.155 --> 18:10.089
Oh, wow!

18:10.157 --> 18:12.625
It's horrible.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.993
I knew it.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.795
Thanks a lot
for lying to me, Albert.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.664
ALBERT: Sorry. Didn't want
to freak you out.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.066
You weren't lying to me though,
were you?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.234
This doesn't look too bad?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.903
Um, no. You're
gonna be fine.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.972
Thanks.
Yeah.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.208
Jimmy, what
were you thinking?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.942
I wanted to help you.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.411
I was stupid, I know.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.413
I guess you have
an idiot for a boyfriend.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.115
No, no, I used to have
an idiot for a boyfriend.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.218
Look, Wyatt just wanted
to give me pills

18:38.285 --> 18:39.952
so the problem would go away.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.521
You wanted to help me fix it,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.690
so I didn't have to sleep
with pantyhose on my head.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.492
ALBERT: She sleeps with
pantyhose on her head?

18:45.925 --> 18:47.627
Shut up.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.898
(sighs) Listen, I'm going to try
to sleep without the pantyhose.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.433
Hopefully with your help,

18:53.500 --> 18:56.969
I will get to a place one day
where I can do that.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.104
Are you crazy?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.972
Look what these things can do.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.174
Uh, and they're everywhere.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.109
And they have thousands
of babies each.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.143
During the day,
we can help each other

19:04.211 --> 19:05.144
watch out for them,
but at night...

19:05.212 --> 19:06.246
Well, I guess it's good

19:06.313 --> 19:07.847
the pantyhose
come in packs of two, huh?

19:07.914 --> 19:08.881
And, I guess, it's also good

19:08.948 --> 19:09.849
that apparently,

19:09.916 --> 19:11.984
we have the same level
of weirdness.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.321
ALBERT: Oh, my God,
so now you're both sleeping

19:14.387 --> 19:15.755
with pantyhose on your heads?

19:15.822 --> 19:18.358
You guys are weird.
(clears throat)

19:21.894 --> 19:23.863
Oh, my God!

19:23.930 --> 19:26.533
Get it out! Get it out!

19:26.599 --> 19:29.936
VIRGINIA:
Okay, well, thanks for calling.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.273
Yeah, we'll see you
when you get home. Mm-hmm.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.874
That was Jimmy. He's fine.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.844
He just wanted to make sure we
caught the rest of the spiders.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.279
I think I got them all.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.281
I mean, one might have
run under the couch,

19:41.348 --> 19:44.016
but I'm sure there's
something under there

19:44.083 --> 19:45.685
that can kill a spider.

19:48.721 --> 19:52.459
Look, about me wearing
the pantyhose on my head,

19:52.525 --> 19:55.962
I didn't tell you because
I thought you would think it was

19:56.028 --> 19:57.230
I shave my feet.

19:57.297 --> 19:57.997
What?

19:58.064 --> 19:59.866
I'm a foot-shaver.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.968
My little piggies
look like monkeys.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.337
Why didn't you tell me?

20:04.404 --> 20:05.805
I was gonna,
but when you saw Andrew do it,

20:05.872 --> 20:09.442
you were so disgusted, I thought
it would be a deal breaker.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.044
The only reason
I was disgusted

20:12.111 --> 20:14.180
was because
I saw Andrew do it.

20:14.247 --> 20:18.084
No matter what weird
thing you ever did,

20:18.150 --> 20:20.052
I would still always
just act like

20:20.119 --> 20:22.589
it's normal because...

20:22.655 --> 20:24.557
I love you.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.527
And I wouldn't have made fun
of Sabrina wearing pantyhose

20:27.594 --> 20:29.762
on her head if I knew
you were going to do that.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.030
I won't make fun
of her again.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.565
Oh, no, you can
make fun of her,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.367
just not about that.
She's short,

20:34.434 --> 20:37.270
she drives
that stupid moped.
(laughs)

20:37.337 --> 20:38.638
And when she wears
that big ol' helmet,

20:38.705 --> 20:40.973
she looks like Gazoo
from The Flintstones.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.843
(laughs)
See? We'll be fine.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.181
Veronica!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.484
That's Arlo's wife's name.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.621
JIMMY: When you really care
about someone,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.823
part of the bargain is they
accept your weird stuff...

20:56.889 --> 20:57.790
(screams)

20:59.258 --> 21:01.794
...and you accept theirs,

21:01.861 --> 21:04.631
which allows you to get on
with the more fun parts

21:04.697 --> 21:05.932
of really caring
about someone.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.402
And on this occasion,
one person's weird thing

21:09.469 --> 21:11.371
became all of our weird things.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.674
Except for Maw Maw.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.877
She thought all this "afraid
of spiders" stuff was crazy.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.914
(Maw Maw snoring)

21:34.193 --> 21:36.996
Do something
nice tomorrow.
