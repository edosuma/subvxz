00:40.666 --> 00:41.904
Whoa!

00:42.024 --> 00:43.985
Bra ad on page two!

00:44.019 --> 00:45.435
Wasn't ready for that.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.488
Jeff, are you sure that's the way

00:47.523 --> 00:48.383
you want to eat your cereal?

00:48.457 --> 00:50.425
That's how the boy
on the box is eating it.

00:52.395 --> 00:54.462
That's not a boy, that's a mummy.

00:54.497 --> 00:55.931
Go get a bowl.

00:55.965 --> 00:57.666
Finally, here's an article...

00:57.700 --> 00:59.885
"A woman choked on
her own bra."

00:59.919 --> 01:01.386
What newspaper is this?

01:01.420 --> 01:03.989
Morning...

01:04.040 --> 01:05.140
Roger!

01:05.174 --> 01:06.708
Why are you walking around
without a disguise?

01:06.742 --> 01:08.376
You know Jeff can't
know you're an alien!

01:08.411 --> 01:10.295
This is the talkiest rape ever.

01:10.329 --> 01:11.796
Go put on some clothes right now!

01:11.831 --> 01:13.148
This is my house.

01:13.182 --> 01:15.100
I should be able to
sit around naked if I want.

01:15.134 --> 01:16.935
Glass of scotch in my hand,

01:16.969 --> 01:18.336
fan on my crotch.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.872
Scotch-crotch-bygotch.

01:20.907 --> 01:23.625
Get into the
overalls business immediately.

01:23.659 --> 01:26.461
Roger, if Jeff finds out you're
an alien he's gonna blab.

01:26.495 --> 01:27.963
The kid can't keep a secret.

01:27.997 --> 01:29.864
Do you have an example?
I do.

01:29.899 --> 01:32.467
Francine's throwing
a surprise party for you

01:32.501 --> 01:33.969
next Friday at 7:00 p.m.

01:34.003 --> 01:36.171
She got you the movie
<i>The Usual Suspects.</i>

01:36.205 --> 01:38.073
Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze.

01:38.107 --> 01:40.175
Takes all the names
from the things in the room.

01:42.261 --> 01:44.145
Listen, if the CIA finds out

01:44.163 --> 01:46.163
we've been harboring an alien,
they'll kill us all.

01:46.182 --> 01:47.849
He's not gonna tell anybody.

01:47.883 --> 01:49.167
He will.

01:49.201 --> 01:51.219
And in order to protect my
family, I'll have to kill him.

01:51.254 --> 01:52.854
Or you. Or both of you.

01:52.888 --> 01:54.005
You wouldn't kill me.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.390
You love me too much.

02:12.975 --> 02:14.442
See?
You're mean!

02:14.477 --> 02:15.777
And you're a pain in my ass.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.112
Now go put on an outfit!

02:17.146 --> 02:19.147
Mean!

02:29.292 --> 02:30.258
<i>Pichaña?</i>

02:30.293 --> 02:31.526
<i>Obrigado!</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:32.827
Hey, who's she?

02:32.862 --> 02:33.828
No one.

02:33.863 --> 02:34.996
A colorful immigrant.

02:35.031 --> 02:37.032
Can I see you for a minute?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.753
You know this is not what I
meant by putting on clothes!

02:41.787 --> 02:43.855
Now go upstairs and put on an outfit

02:43.889 --> 02:45.357
that does not call attention to you.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.826
But there's gotta be a way
for me to be naked!

02:47.860 --> 02:50.261
Stan, there's always
a way around things.

02:50.296 --> 02:51.363
Listen to me, Roger.

02:51.397 --> 02:52.664
It is never gonna happen.

02:52.698 --> 02:54.699
You're never gonna happen!

02:56.068 --> 02:57.335
Don't worry, I got it.

02:57.370 --> 02:58.870
Uh... uh...

02:58.904 --> 02:59.888
Nope. Nope.

02:59.922 --> 03:00.889
I'm goin' over.

03:04.577 --> 03:07.212
Yeah, Toshi!

03:07.246 --> 03:08.747
Amazing!

03:08.781 --> 03:10.448
What's everyone so excited about?

03:10.483 --> 03:11.716
He's not even halfway up.

03:11.751 --> 03:13.051
Forget about the rope.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.620
Toshi's ass came in!

03:17.556 --> 03:19.574
Kid finally got his adult butt.

03:22.928 --> 03:25.180
Welcome to the club!

03:25.214 --> 03:26.915
Look at my butt!

03:26.949 --> 03:29.017
Now look at my front butt!

03:39.895 --> 03:41.796
Yeah, congratulations.

03:41.831 --> 03:42.997
Don't worry, buddy.

03:43.032 --> 03:44.699
You're just a late bloomer.

03:44.734 --> 03:47.452
Trust me, no one's even noticed.

03:47.486 --> 03:49.821
Hey Steve, you want to
hear a joke so funny

03:49.855 --> 03:51.139
you'll laugh your ass off?

03:51.173 --> 03:52.140
Oh!

03:52.174 --> 03:53.408
I see you've already heard it.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.594
Steve, look...
No, Snot!

03:56.629 --> 03:57.612
They're right.

03:57.646 --> 03:59.381
I'm flat!

04:01.450 --> 04:02.584
Oh God...

04:16.699 --> 04:18.466
God, why am I wearing tweed?

04:18.500 --> 04:19.901
I just want to be naked,

04:19.935 --> 04:21.820
but Stan's making me wear
this uncomfortable outfit

04:21.853 --> 04:22.954
because of Jeff.

04:22.988 --> 04:25.807
It's so moist and sweaty in here.

04:25.841 --> 04:27.442
Ugh, the slugs are back again.

04:28.878 --> 04:31.045
Hayley, can you please tell your dad

04:31.080 --> 04:33.348
that Jeff can handle
the fact I'm an alien?

04:33.382 --> 04:34.382
Ugh.

04:34.417 --> 04:35.550
This must be the mother.

04:35.584 --> 04:36.818
Actually, I agree with my dad.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.052
Jeff can't handle it.

04:38.087 --> 04:39.487
He's like a child.

04:39.522 --> 04:40.922
I mean, up until last year

04:40.956 --> 04:42.557
he had an imaginary
friend named Phillip.

04:42.591 --> 04:44.426
Seriously?
Yeah...

04:44.460 --> 04:46.761
he was actually
the best man at our wedding.

04:50.699 --> 04:53.802
No one can tell a 20-minute joke
like Phil can!

04:53.836 --> 04:56.271
I love you like a brother, man!

04:56.305 --> 04:59.307
I'm sorry, Roger, there's just
no way you can be naked.

05:01.076 --> 05:03.077
Or is there?

05:05.080 --> 05:07.282
Oh, no, this is the mother.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.287
C'mon, you stupid butt.

05:12.321 --> 05:13.873
Stay up there.

05:20.738 --> 05:21.935
Oh, Steve.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.698
What's that in your pants?

05:23.732 --> 05:25.283
It's my butt.

05:25.317 --> 05:27.435
Mom!

05:27.470 --> 05:28.736
Aw, honey.

05:28.771 --> 05:31.573
Is everyone else's tushie
filling out except yours?

05:31.607 --> 05:33.174
Yes.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.109
What if my ass never comes in?

05:35.144 --> 05:36.511
Oh, it will.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.679
What if it doesn't?

05:37.713 --> 05:41.182
Then you fake it till you make it.

05:43.319 --> 05:45.920
Now, you're gonna want to
change these every two weeks.

05:48.023 --> 05:48.990
I'm out.

05:49.024 --> 05:50.525
So, what do you think?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.161
Look at this.

05:53.195 --> 05:55.797
I think I could marry Ice-T!

05:57.833 --> 06:00.235
There's a coin behind that bush.

06:00.269 --> 06:03.371
Oh my God, what are you?

06:03.405 --> 06:05.640
I'm your new imaginary friend, Jeffery.

06:05.642 --> 06:06.908
Whoa.

06:06.942 --> 06:07.909
Yup.

06:07.943 --> 06:09.511
Oh man, this is great!

06:09.545 --> 06:11.346
I haven't had an imaginary friend

06:11.380 --> 06:13.748
since Phillip and I had a falling out.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.785
Fur is murder!

06:18.804 --> 06:21.389
Drive, Phillip, drive!

06:21.423 --> 06:22.540
What's wrong with you?

06:22.575 --> 06:24.025
I said drive!

06:27.112 --> 06:29.814
Oh man, that is a nasty scar.

06:29.849 --> 06:30.949
Well, don't worry,

06:30.983 --> 06:32.550
I'll never let you down like that.

06:32.585 --> 06:34.702
Cool, a new imaginary friend!

06:34.737 --> 06:36.704
I've got so much to tell you!

06:36.739 --> 06:38.806
Did you know Keyser Soze
was Kevin Spacey?

06:38.841 --> 06:40.008
I did.

06:40.042 --> 06:42.677
I've known that for about 15 years now.

06:47.810 --> 06:49.443
Hey, let me show you around the house.

06:49.578 --> 06:50.497
Good idea!

06:50.558 --> 06:51.926
Race you downstairs!

06:54.429 --> 06:55.527
Quick family meeting.

06:55.647 --> 06:58.103
Roger! Jeff's home! Go put on an outfit!
About that.

06:58.223 --> 06:59.603
Jeff's about to come downstairs

06:59.638 --> 07:01.205
and he thinks I'm his imaginary friend,

07:01.239 --> 07:03.023
which means when he's around,
you all have to pretend

07:03.058 --> 07:04.091
you can't see or hear me.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.092
Naked in the house.

07:05.126 --> 07:06.487
Looks like I found a way around it.

07:06.528 --> 07:08.162
Roger, I'm gonna kill...
Here he comes now!

07:08.196 --> 07:08.935
And... go!

07:09.055 --> 07:11.232
Who are you gonna kill, Mr. Smith?
Uh...

07:11.266 --> 07:13.538
this entire gallon of 2% milk.

07:14.402 --> 07:16.270
No, Stan, that milk is old.

07:16.304 --> 07:18.172
It's been on the coffee table for weeks.

07:19.207 --> 07:21.508
Chunky!

07:24.079 --> 07:27.214
Hey boys, what's your
favorite car of the train?

07:27.249 --> 07:29.533
Mine's the caboose!

07:30.735 --> 07:32.336
It came in, Steve!

07:32.370 --> 07:33.370
Mazels!

07:35.307 --> 07:37.124
I smell ham!

07:38.143 --> 07:40.244
Is it my bellybutton?

07:41.279 --> 07:42.980
Nope. Chicken finger.

07:43.014 --> 07:44.215
Well, well.

07:44.249 --> 07:46.250
What do we have here?

07:46.284 --> 07:47.318
Yeah, Court.

07:47.352 --> 07:48.986
This baby popped last night.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.221
I was brushing my teeth,

07:50.255 --> 07:52.089
and all of a sudden
it was like <i>ba-bow!</i>

07:52.123 --> 07:54.341
Blew the damn pockets off my jeans.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.010
My cousin was like, wow!

07:56.044 --> 07:58.679
There's something delicious in here!

07:58.713 --> 08:00.714
No, Barry!

08:03.585 --> 08:06.820
Hey everyone, Steve Smith stuffs!

08:08.189 --> 08:09.189
Classic.

08:11.710 --> 08:13.811
I had a funny run-in
at the car wash today.

08:13.845 --> 08:15.729
You'll never guess who I ran into.

08:15.764 --> 08:17.865
The witch who cursed you
with a button penis?

08:17.899 --> 08:19.283
Hey Jeff, how funny is it

08:19.317 --> 08:21.197
that you're the only one
who can see or hear me?

08:22.687 --> 08:24.371
Yoshi.

08:24.406 --> 08:25.522
Our old gardener.

08:25.557 --> 08:27.174
Oh, really?
How's he...

08:29.945 --> 08:32.696
How's he...

08:39.421 --> 08:40.821
You okay, Mrs. S?

08:40.855 --> 08:42.823
Oh yeah... uh...

08:42.857 --> 08:44.391
I just had my...

08:44.426 --> 08:46.527
uh... period.

08:46.561 --> 08:48.312
It was pretty big.

08:58.723 --> 09:00.741
There's no faking it, Mother!

09:00.775 --> 09:02.810
My onion's never gonna blossom.

09:02.844 --> 09:04.645
Well, then it's God's plan,

09:04.679 --> 09:06.714
and you have to be happy
with who you are.

09:06.748 --> 09:07.881
God's plan?

09:07.916 --> 09:09.633
You mean the guy who
has me walking around

09:09.668 --> 09:11.535
with nothing more than
a brown hole in my back?

09:11.569 --> 09:13.203
Yeah, let's leave it up to that guy!

09:17.876 --> 09:19.243
Hey bud, watch this.

09:22.914 --> 09:24.581
Hey, Roger. Turn on
the game show network.

09:24.616 --> 09:26.617
I'm on it.

09:34.793 --> 09:36.327
Hey...

09:36.361 --> 09:39.063
Did you just talk
to my imaginary friend?

09:39.097 --> 09:41.198
And did you just pick up a remote?

09:41.232 --> 09:43.233
Klaus, you idiot!
What?

09:43.268 --> 09:45.452
Jeff didn't know Roger was an alien.

09:45.487 --> 09:47.071
He thought he was imaginary!

09:47.105 --> 09:48.939
Aw, no!

09:48.973 --> 09:50.941
Really? Sorry, guys.

09:50.975 --> 09:52.760
Tonight I do the dishes.

09:52.794 --> 09:54.578
Whoa, whoa, wait.

09:54.612 --> 09:55.579
You're real?

09:55.613 --> 09:57.331
A real alien?

09:57.365 --> 09:58.665
Had my nips enlarged,

09:58.700 --> 10:01.652
but other than that,
everything is au natural.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.620
Hayley, you knew he was an alien?

10:03.655 --> 10:05.005
Why didn't you tell me?

10:05.040 --> 10:06.523
Because you can't keep a secret.

10:06.558 --> 10:09.209
And now that you know,
to protect this family,

10:09.244 --> 10:10.994
I have to kill either you or Roger.

10:11.029 --> 10:12.029
Dad, no!

10:12.063 --> 10:14.164
I love him!
Thank you.

10:14.199 --> 10:15.799
The feeling's not mutual,

10:15.834 --> 10:17.234
I find you a little doughy, but...

10:17.268 --> 10:18.302
Not you! Jeff!

10:18.336 --> 10:20.170
You can't kill my husband.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.538
Fine, then I'll kill Roger.

10:21.573 --> 10:24.875
You can't kill Roger,
he's part of our family!

10:24.909 --> 10:27.061
Well, someone better decide
who's gonna die here!

10:27.095 --> 10:29.797
If the CIA finds out we have
an alien, we're all dead.

10:29.831 --> 10:31.632
Mr. Smith, no one has to die!

10:31.666 --> 10:33.434
I promise I won't tell anyone!

10:33.468 --> 10:34.435
I swear!

10:34.469 --> 10:35.969
I swear on my promise!

10:36.004 --> 10:37.604
That's not what people say, Jeff.

10:37.639 --> 10:39.106
Dad, Jeff won't tell.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.808
I know you think he's an idiot,

10:40.842 --> 10:42.509
but there's no way
he's gonna tell anyone

10:42.544 --> 10:44.878
knowing that his life is at stake.

10:44.913 --> 10:46.113
No, a real live alien!

10:46.147 --> 10:47.481
Roger, here.

10:47.515 --> 10:49.349
Tell the guy who runs
the toaster at Quiznos

10:49.384 --> 10:52.019
I'm not lying!

11:06.551 --> 11:07.901
Principal Lewis!

11:07.936 --> 11:10.387
Was your ass always
so plump and luscious?

11:10.422 --> 11:11.688
Nah, nah-nah.

11:11.723 --> 11:13.957
I used to be a skinny
little turd just like you

11:13.992 --> 11:15.459
until I found these babies.

11:16.828 --> 11:18.862
I said I love my d-nuts!

11:18.897 --> 11:20.314
Black bagels, y'all!

11:31.493 --> 11:34.128
There's only one fair way
to choose who dies.

11:34.162 --> 11:36.497
The old pillow case grab bag.

11:38.750 --> 11:39.883
One of these guns is empty

11:39.918 --> 11:41.368
and the other one has a ton of bullets.

11:41.386 --> 11:43.203
Wait, don't shoot me!

11:43.238 --> 11:45.072
Okay, okay, I've been waiting for

11:45.106 --> 11:46.507
a good time to tell you this:

11:46.541 --> 11:49.460
I know a way you can cut
your heating bill in half.

11:49.494 --> 11:50.461
Enough!

11:50.495 --> 11:52.029
It's up to fate now.

11:52.063 --> 11:53.130
Come on, Stan.

11:53.164 --> 11:54.665
There's gotta be a way around this.

11:54.699 --> 11:56.266
There's always a way around everything.

11:56.301 --> 11:58.268
I warned you, Roger,
but you didn't listen

11:58.303 --> 12:01.138
and now one of you is going
to leave this Earth.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.640
Wait!

12:03.675 --> 12:04.741
That's it!

12:04.776 --> 12:06.109
No one has to die.

12:06.144 --> 12:07.544
There is a way around this.

12:07.579 --> 12:09.613
I can go back to my home planet.

12:09.647 --> 12:12.749
You mean leave...
forever?

12:12.784 --> 12:14.751
If that's what it takes.

12:14.786 --> 12:16.820
I guess that could work.

12:16.855 --> 12:18.372
Oh, thank God.

12:18.406 --> 12:19.756
And... just for fun.

12:21.759 --> 12:23.777
Damn it, I could have stayed!

12:29.230 --> 12:31.198
My old spaceship's in here, Stan.

12:31.232 --> 12:34.017
I'll just fire it up
and place a call home.

12:34.575 --> 12:35.842
There she is.

12:35.876 --> 12:39.579
Broken down, filthy,
cockpit full of mouse turds.

12:39.614 --> 12:41.314
The <i>SS Bonnie Raitt.</i>

12:41.349 --> 12:43.199
Poor thing.

12:50.791 --> 12:53.293
Antennas activate.

12:53.327 --> 12:55.478
I... I'm just
puttin' on a voice.

12:55.513 --> 12:57.864
All I have to do now is tell
them where to pick me up.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.200
Well, what are you waiting for?

13:00.234 --> 13:01.701
Do I have to go?

13:01.736 --> 13:03.203
My planet's freezing cold,

13:03.237 --> 13:05.939
there's no booze,
and sex is so boring up there.

13:05.973 --> 13:07.173
It's all consensual.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.275
Sorry, Roger.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.576
You've gone too far this time.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.361
There's really no way around it.

13:11.395 --> 13:12.963
I guess not.

13:17.885 --> 13:19.252
They're picking me up

13:19.287 --> 13:21.655
at the base of the Chimdale
Mountains on Tuesday.

13:21.689 --> 13:22.739
Aw, damn it.

13:22.790 --> 13:25.809
I had two pap smears
scheduled for that day.

13:36.304 --> 13:39.673
This is the place.

13:39.707 --> 13:42.976
I'd like the Ba-donkin'
Dirty Dozen, please.

13:47.281 --> 13:48.515
All right, donuts,

13:48.549 --> 13:50.867
you've changed
all these people for the better.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.769
Now, work your magic on me.

13:57.391 --> 13:59.392
Gimmie donut holes!

14:02.046 --> 14:04.497
I gotta stop wearing corduroys!

14:05.883 --> 14:07.534
Donut fire!

14:14.208 --> 14:15.775
There's no way out!

14:15.810 --> 14:17.560
We're all gonna die!

14:19.597 --> 14:21.648
Oh, my God!

14:21.682 --> 14:24.601
There's a space between
those two wedged fatties.

14:24.635 --> 14:26.236
If only there was someone here

14:26.270 --> 14:28.688
with a flat enough ass to get through!

14:30.658 --> 14:33.760
Sir, I think I might have
been born for this job.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.193
I made it!

14:50.227 --> 14:51.194
I'm free!

14:51.228 --> 14:53.229
Call... for help!

14:57.968 --> 14:58.935
Nine-one-one.

14:58.969 --> 15:00.203
I'd like to report a fire!

15:00.237 --> 15:01.337
Where are you?

15:01.372 --> 15:02.539
Where?

15:02.573 --> 15:03.740
I'll tell ya where.

15:03.774 --> 15:07.277
In a better place now
than I was earlier.

15:07.311 --> 15:08.678
What does
that even mean...?

15:08.713 --> 15:10.847
It means I gotta learn to like myself,

15:10.881 --> 15:13.750
even if my big boy butt never comes in.

15:13.784 --> 15:15.218
You know what, kid?

15:15.252 --> 15:17.087
I think you're gonna be all right.

15:17.121 --> 15:19.639
Yeah... yeah, me, too.

15:30.384 --> 15:34.287
Well, where I'm going, I won't
be needing any more disguises.

15:34.321 --> 15:36.623
Klaus, I'm leaving you all my outfits.

15:36.657 --> 15:38.391
What good is clothing to me?

15:38.426 --> 15:39.926
None.
That's the point.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.311
One final  you.

15:41.362 --> 15:42.829
Oh, Roger.

15:42.863 --> 15:46.699
Who's gonna do sake bombs with
me and kick it old-school?

15:46.734 --> 15:48.234
I don't know, that sounds like something

15:48.269 --> 15:50.203
a Japanese person might be into.

15:50.237 --> 15:54.574
Roger, I just want to say what
you're doing for Jeff and me...

15:54.608 --> 15:56.910
it's something I'll never forget.

15:56.944 --> 16:00.146
And the one thing I'll never
forget about you Hayley is...

16:00.181 --> 16:02.048
your flute playing?

16:02.082 --> 16:03.883
Do you play the flute?

16:03.918 --> 16:05.251
No?

16:05.286 --> 16:06.653
Not you?

16:06.687 --> 16:08.188
Roger.

16:08.222 --> 16:09.489
It's time.

16:09.523 --> 16:10.990
So it is.

16:14.895 --> 16:16.262
Wow.

16:16.297 --> 16:17.530
Seems like just yesterday

16:17.565 --> 16:21.267
I did so many different
things that I remember...

16:46.260 --> 16:47.927
Huh? Huh?

17:34.191 --> 17:36.559
♪ No...

18:28.729 --> 18:30.096
Are you sure this is the spot where

18:30.130 --> 18:31.247
the ship is picking you up?

18:31.282 --> 18:33.032
These are the coordinates I gave them.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.284
There it is!

19:14.825 --> 19:15.925
Eh. False alarm.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.960
Just my principal.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.044
Maybe they're not coming.

19:25.753 --> 19:28.037
Ugh, they sent a round one.

19:28.088 --> 19:29.389
I like the pointy ones.

19:34.428 --> 19:36.195
I guess this is me.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.384
Well, so...

19:41.418 --> 19:43.653
this is goodbye.

19:43.687 --> 19:45.455
You dummy.

19:45.489 --> 19:47.090
Why couldn't you have
just listened to me?

19:47.124 --> 19:48.324
None of this would have happened.

19:49.793 --> 19:52.595
Why weren't me and you ever
single at the same time?

19:52.629 --> 19:54.430
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

19:54.465 --> 19:56.199
I'm gonna miss you, too.

20:01.605 --> 20:03.239
Take care of yourself.

20:03.273 --> 20:04.574
You too, Stan.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.542
You, too.

20:13.634 --> 20:15.752
Please. No tears.

20:15.803 --> 20:18.137
I'm on to a whole new adventure.

20:18.172 --> 20:20.223
And so are you guys.

20:20.257 --> 20:22.725
Jeff... don't you
dare feel bad about this.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.843
You hear me?

20:23.877 --> 20:25.928
This was my fault, not yours.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.598
Thank you so much
for saying that, Roger.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.349
Come here, honey.

20:31.485 --> 20:33.603
Aah! No! Hayley!

20:33.654 --> 20:34.604
Jeff!

20:34.655 --> 20:35.788
No!

20:38.642 --> 20:41.077
Roger, make them turn around!

20:41.111 --> 20:42.512
No. Wait.

20:42.546 --> 20:45.048
Stop. Come back.

20:45.082 --> 20:48.151
See, I told ya there's always
a way around things.

20:48.185 --> 20:49.419
Guess you were right.

20:49.453 --> 20:51.654
I gotta stop underestimating you.

20:53.457 --> 20:55.858
What the hell just happened?

20:55.893 --> 20:59.034
My Jeff...
My dear, sweet...

20:59.154 --> 21:01.422
Hurry up, Hayley!
You're sitting in the middle.
