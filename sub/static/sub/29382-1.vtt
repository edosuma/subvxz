00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(silence)

00:05.673 --> 00:07.939
(customers chattering)

00:07.942 --> 00:12.244
(band music playing
in background)

00:29.663 --> 00:31.530
(glass clinking)

00:33.200 --> 00:34.166
Hey!

00:34.168 --> 00:35.467
(Ben laughs)

00:35.469 --> 00:37.703
(glass clinking)

00:37.705 --> 00:38.637
[Rachel] Speech!

00:38.639 --> 00:40.439
(glass clinking)

00:40.441 --> 00:42.041
You gotta do it now,
she already clinked it.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.410
(laughing) Let's go,
Ben. Come on, buddy.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.511
(cheering)

00:45.513 --> 00:49.681
Okay, okay, well first of all,

00:49.683 --> 00:51.950
thank you all for
coming tonight.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.253
It means a lot and I
honestly never thought

00:54.255 --> 00:58.957
I'd be the one inviting all
of you here to my wedding.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.159
Wasn't gonna be for mine.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.161
Hmm, nope.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.797
But in any case,
I'm really so happy

01:04.799 --> 01:06.398
to be sharing this
with all of you.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.535
And Lisa, I...

01:11.405 --> 01:14.907
You know, I had a dream
last night about tomorrow.

01:14.909 --> 01:18.210
I was heading to the
church and all these things

01:18.212 --> 01:20.512
kept coming up and
getting in my way.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.048
I just got so scared.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.050
I was actually thinking
about giving up.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.452
And then I woke up

01:28.155 --> 01:30.522
and the first thing
I thought of was you.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.861
I just wanted to talk to you.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.330
And I'm so happy to be sharing

01:38.332 --> 01:39.698
the rest of our lives together.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.867
Save some of
this for tomorrow.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.136
Yeah. Sorry. (chuckles)

01:44.138 --> 01:45.971
Again, thank you all for coming

01:45.973 --> 01:49.141
and let's have a great
time tomorrow, yeah?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.375
Cheers.

01:50.377 --> 01:53.512
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.214
He's such a mush monkey.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.550
I think he's gonna cry
tomorrow, I know it.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.322
- Bye.
- Thank you for coming.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.991
Good to see you, man.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.459
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.495
See you tomorrow.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.662
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Thank you so much,

02:10.663 --> 02:12.764
- Bye Lauren.
- Drive safe, okay?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.333
Have a good night.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.136
What are you doing?

02:17.138 --> 02:20.772
Hey, I wanted to give
you my gift, your gift.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.040
Did you forget?

02:22.042 --> 02:25.377
No, no, I just don't
have it here with me.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.045
Best best man ever.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.614
Thank you, Rachel.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.450
Valet is bringing
the car around.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.886
Getting kind of late, so
you two better wrap it up.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.288
Don't open it now,
wait till you get home.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.290
I'll wait too.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.993
See you in the morning?

02:40.995 --> 02:43.095
Yes, absolutely, but can
I walk you to the hotel?

02:43.097 --> 02:44.363
I wanna be a proper gentleman.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.565
No, no, no I'll
go with Samantha.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.766
Get some rest.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.001
If you go to bed now,
you might actually

02:49.003 --> 02:50.836
be well-rested tomorrow.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.803
Yeah, I will, I'll
go straight to bed.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.239
[Lisa & Samantha] Goodnight.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.775
(piano music)

03:02.082 --> 03:03.315
[Rachel] Ready?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.017
I actually think
I'm gonna take a walk.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.185
You sure?

03:06.187 --> 03:08.086
Yeah, yeah, it's
nice out, get some air.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.321
You know, just drop Bobby off

03:09.323 --> 03:10.989
and I'll see you
back at the place?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.824
Okay. Oh you want
me to to take that?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.059
Please, yeah.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.028
So I will see you
tomorrow, okay?

03:16.030 --> 03:18.363
And I'll leave
the door unlocked.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.198
Thank you.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.098
You're welcome.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.833
[Bobby] Okay, bye.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.538
Hey, dad and I
got you something.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.475
It's at the house, don't
drink it all tonight.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.010
Okay, promise.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.679
[Rachel] (chuckles) Bye.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.746
Have a good night.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.777
Hi!

05:46.380 --> 05:49.715
It's so good to see you.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.916
What are you doing here?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.684
Oh, I'm here with Jules.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.486
Jules is here?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.722
She is, she's
here to tell you.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.658
Maria, what are
you doing here?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.993
Ooh, I really want to say

06:01.995 --> 06:04.830
but it's totally a Jules thing.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.565
What thing?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.133
This is a really nice place,

06:08.135 --> 06:09.634
how long have you lived here?

06:09.636 --> 06:11.136
Maria, are you sure that
you don't want to like...

06:11.138 --> 06:13.372
She should be here soon.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.409
(wistful guitar music)

06:17.411 --> 06:18.411
Hey Ben.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.680
Jules?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.649
Hi.

06:27.721 --> 06:32.157
So did Maria fill you in?

06:32.159 --> 06:32.991
What?

06:32.993 --> 06:33.792
This is your thing.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.794
Come on, tell him.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.796
I'm in love with you.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.030
What?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.532
She's in love with you.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.101
Yeah, hold on, do you know
I'm getting married tomorrow?

06:43.103 --> 06:47.038
Yeah, and I was trying to
reconcile that within myself

06:47.040 --> 06:49.207
and I realized it.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.346
So what do you think?

06:54.348 --> 06:56.748
I think it's
pretty weird, Jules.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.517
I mean it's pretty messed up.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.186
Okay, well I had to
tell you how I felt.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.422
I couldn't let you get
married without telling you

07:03.424 --> 07:04.723
how I feel.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.991
And what do you
expect me to do?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.826
I don't expect
you to do anything.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.829
Okay, well this seems
to be moving along well

07:10.831 --> 07:13.231
so I'm gonna go to the
bar and have a drink.

07:14.968 --> 07:15.801
Okay.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.635
Okay.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.469
Yeah, okay good.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.870
Yes, that's good.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.872
Oh, no, wait.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.474
(breaking glass)

07:23.577 --> 07:27.112
Do you wanna give
me the keys to the car

07:27.114 --> 07:30.715
in case things go well and you
maybe wanna stay the night?

07:30.717 --> 07:33.385
If I don't hear from you
in like 10, 15 minutes

07:33.387 --> 07:34.387
I'll call a Lyft?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.055
I think you both should leave.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.691
I don't really follow what's
going on but I think you,

07:39.693 --> 07:40.625
no, don't do that.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.994
Ben, I just wanna talk.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.330
I'm not really comfortable.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.332
What?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.668
I mean come on, it's me.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.238
Okay, you know what?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.707
I'm not asking you
for anything, okay?

07:55.709 --> 07:59.778
I just have been
thinking about you a lot,

07:59.780 --> 08:02.214
since I saw on Facebook that
you were getting married.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.249
And it's driving me crazy.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.052
So I just wanted to come
over here and talk, okay?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.054
That's it.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.222
You just left.

08:13.427 --> 08:14.860
I know.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.294
And that was it.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.796
You wanna know
what I think about?

08:17.798 --> 08:20.799
That's what I think about, do
you want to talk about that?

08:21.802 --> 08:22.802
No.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.606
Um, I was thinking more we
talk about the good times.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.441
You know when a good
time to think about

08:29.443 --> 08:30.375
the good times would have been?

08:30.377 --> 08:32.477
Probably before now, for sure.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.782
[Ben] What are you
trying to do here, Jules?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.919
I'm not trying to do anything.

08:40.921 --> 08:45.991
I feel compelled, okay?

08:46.793 --> 08:48.960
To be with you and talk to you

08:48.962 --> 08:50.428
and work through this with you.

08:50.430 --> 08:54.633
And then we can go our
separate ways, okay or not.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.336
This is crazy, Jules.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.638
You gotta stop, okay?

08:59.640 --> 09:00.872
You can't just come back in here

09:00.874 --> 09:03.074
and think that I would just...

09:03.076 --> 09:04.109
Yeah, okay.

09:06.013 --> 09:11.082
You were right, I don't think
that you would just anything.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.454
I'm sorry.

09:18.892 --> 09:23.161
I'm sorry for the way
that I ended things.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.800
I just wanted you
to know that and...

09:31.471 --> 09:33.505
You know, also that
I'm in love with you.

09:33.507 --> 09:34.839
Jules.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.641
I made a mistake, okay?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.110
I made a big mistake.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.580
But we are good together, okay?

09:41.582 --> 09:44.649
We're really good, we made
each other better people.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.085
Okay, well you made
me a better person

09:47.087 --> 09:49.487
but I mean I got
you out of your head

09:49.489 --> 09:52.324
and out into the world
and it was so good.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.726
I mean, don't you miss it?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.436
Maria?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.271
What's up?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.940
Hey, what are you doing?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.776
I'm just hanging.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.845
(chuckles) No, I mean
what are you doing here?

10:13.847 --> 10:17.082
Why are you sitting outside
of Ben and Lisa's house?

10:17.084 --> 10:19.684
Mmm, I'm waiting for
Jules while she goes

10:19.686 --> 10:20.686
to work on Ben.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.456
I'm sorry, is Jules here?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.458
Mmm.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.527
Is she inside?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.165
Okay, I'm gonna take
that as a yes, excuse me.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.002
[Jules] Into the world and...

10:38.238 --> 10:39.571
What are you doing here?

10:39.573 --> 10:40.839
Rachel.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.007
What the hell
is she doing here?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.475
She's staying with me tonight.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.609
Seriously, you're asking
what I'm doing here.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.443
She's my best man.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.544
The best best man.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.046
Ugh.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.781
And she's spending the night?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.321
- It's fine.
- I know.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.623
Jules, what are
you doing here?

10:58.625 --> 10:59.858
I'm here to talk to Ben.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.426
What do you want
to talk to Ben about?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.527
It's a private matter.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.895
You need to go, now.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.365
Calm down, Rachel.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.833
I am calm.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.902
Okay, Rachel, Jules.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
What?

11:15.475 --> 11:16.908
I don't know.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.778
This is sort of, I don't really
know the protocol for this

11:19.780 --> 11:21.379
but I don't want
you guys to fight.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.248
(chuckles) You don't
know the protocol for this?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.516
What are you talking about?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.951
Okay, okay, Rachel,
I know that you and I

11:26.953 --> 11:28.620
never had a great relationship,

11:28.622 --> 11:30.855
but do you think that you
can maybe give Ben and I

11:30.857 --> 11:33.158
just a few minutes
to talk privately?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.693
I don't know what's going
through your head right now.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.761
Jules, you need to go home,
you don't wanna do this.

11:36.763 --> 11:37.729
Yep, I'm pretty sure I do.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.563
You don't.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.798
Rachel...

11:39.800 --> 11:41.466
No Jules, don't push this.

11:41.468 --> 11:45.770
Please, five minutes
to talk privately.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.273
Yeah, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.541
Really?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.176
You are not gonna get
to talk to him alone.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.412
I don't appreciate,
this is unacceptable.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.714
Ben, do you understand that?

11:55.716 --> 11:58.483
I am 100% unhappy right now.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.485
Hold this and think
about what you're doing.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.991
(ring tone)

12:06.993 --> 12:08.226
Hey Bobby.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.427
Oh, you don't
need to call Bobby.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.662
Yeah, you might
wanna come over here.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.629
Your brother's about to
make a giant mistake.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.464
What the hell?

12:12.466 --> 12:13.665
Jules is here.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.567
Yeah, and she's trying
to ruin his life.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.470
No, no, I'm officially not
trying to ruin your life.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.072
No, he won't kick
her out, it's...

12:21.074 --> 12:23.007
Oh yeah, if we fought I
would definitely win...

12:23.009 --> 12:24.442
What?

12:24.444 --> 12:25.477
but Ben would probably
just try to break it up, so...

12:25.479 --> 12:26.411
Rachel, hang up the phone.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.779
We're going to deal with this.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.115
Oh, that is a good idea.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.082
You know, I don't
want to do that

12:31.084 --> 12:32.283
but you might be right.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.519
Hey, Ben, which knee
did you have surgery on?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.321
Oh, come on, what
the hell, Bobby?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.455
Just get over here.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.059
Okay look, Rachel,
I understand where you're coming from

12:41.061 --> 12:42.827
and why you feel like
you have to do this,

12:42.829 --> 12:46.264
but we're all adults here
and I don't appreciate

12:46.266 --> 12:47.799
you stomping around like this.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.701
Hey Lisa, it's Rachel.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.704
Oh wow, okay, this is so
not what I wanted to happen.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.305
Yeah, you might
want to come over.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.440
Stop it, Rachel.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.908
Jules, what are you doing?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.777
I do not like where the
numbers are going on this, okay?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.645
If she's gonna call people
then I'm gonna call people too.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.047
Okay, Lisa, it's only
for a little bit...

13:03.049 --> 13:06.818
Hey Lisa, no nothing I just...

13:06.820 --> 13:09.187
We're just having some fun here.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.222
No, it is, it's very weird.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.224
I love you too.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.364
(ring tone)

13:20.600 --> 13:23.835
(Maria's phone rings)

13:30.110 --> 13:32.377
Chica, why aren't
you answering?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.512
Oh, I could hear
everything from out here.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.381
Okay, well I need you.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.683
Okay, well, you're
doing a great job.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.118
Thank you.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.219
Come in, come in.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.054
Okay, if you want to do this

13:43.056 --> 13:45.590
in front of a bunch
of people, I'm down.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.592
Whatever you need, I'm here.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.160
I don't want to do this
in front of everyone,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.128
I don't want to do
it in front anyone.

13:50.130 --> 13:50.962
(door closes)

13:50.964 --> 13:52.397
Look, Ben, we just...

13:52.399 --> 13:53.631
[Rachel] Oh no.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.166
No, I'm gonna listen
to what she has to say.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.068
You know, I'll listen
and she'll talk

13:57.070 --> 13:59.237
and then we're all going to bed.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.772
Are you seriously
not getting this?

14:00.774 --> 14:02.207
I'm not gonna let that happen.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.675
You don't get to let
anything happen or not happen.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.211
What is going on here?

14:06.213 --> 14:10.682
Are you two from, are you
from somewhere that like...

14:10.684 --> 14:14.185
(laughs) I don't know. Somewhere
where things like this...

14:14.187 --> 14:15.286
Is she okay?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.789
I'm okay, I am the okay one.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.492
Okay, Rachel, I came
here to do something and...

14:23.096 --> 14:25.296
Okay, Ben, I love you.

14:25.298 --> 14:29.000
I'm in love with you and I
know that you love me too,

14:29.002 --> 14:31.402
and that's what's
important, okay?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.871
You don't love Lisa, do you?

14:34.241 --> 14:37.842
(scoffs) I mean we're
getting married tomorrow.

14:37.844 --> 14:41.279
Okay, well, I can see where
you're coming from with that.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.747
Yeah, I'll rip the
band-aid off for you, Jules.

14:42.749 --> 14:43.982
He doesn't love you,
you should go home

14:43.984 --> 14:45.350
and think about
what you've done.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.518
Ben, you need to
trust me right now,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.487
you have to get these
two out of here.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.223
You know, this isn't
really about you, Rach.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.126
You know, just stay out of it
and let me handle it, okay?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.495
Ben, don't talk
to me like that.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.497
Rachel.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.698
Was I not there?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.268
Do you not remember this
whole thing coming apart?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.636
You sleeping on my couch

15:04.638 --> 15:06.504
because you couldn't go
back to the apartment,

15:06.506 --> 15:09.540
almost losing your job
because she broke you.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.543
(scoffs)

15:12.545 --> 15:13.578
Broke me?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.013
Yes.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.648
No.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.549
You are so lucky, Ben.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.385
You're lucky you came
out of this last time,

15:20.387 --> 15:23.821
you're lucky that Lisa
came along, snap out of it.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.558
If Josh randomly
showed up at my door,

15:27.560 --> 15:28.726
wouldn't you do something?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.495
Oh, I'd definitely
do something.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.097
So can you see
where I'm coming from?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.365
Where does this go, Ben?

15:35.735 --> 15:38.803
I don't know, I'm not the
one that invited her over.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.105
But if she wants to talk,
then we should talk.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.206
No, that's bullshit.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.408
You are playing with fire.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.510
She's garbage and only
capable of hurting you.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.911
Jesus, Rach.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.714
Jules is right here,
she has feelings.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.748
Thank you.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.283
Rachel, that was really mean.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.888
Ben, babe, please, can we just...

15:56.890 --> 15:58.189
Ben come with me.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.330
Okay, relax.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.698
Breathe.

16:06.700 --> 16:11.069
(inhales, exhales)

16:11.071 --> 16:13.471
(Ben sighs)

16:13.473 --> 16:15.573
Look, I know that this
is a messed up situation

16:15.575 --> 16:17.675
but you are blowing this
way out of proportion.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.478
She just wants to talk,
we'll talk and she'll leave.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.014
Yeah, maybe or I don't know,

16:23.016 --> 16:25.483
maybe she screws with your head
and makes you doubt yourself

16:25.485 --> 16:27.352
and then who knows what.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.220
I do not even want to
think of the hypotheticals

16:29.222 --> 16:30.521
because they're all so bad.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.590
She's not going to
screw with my head.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.426
Jules? No, no, of course not.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.229
I'm crazy to think that
Jules showing up here

16:38.231 --> 16:41.232
the night before your
wedding might throw you off.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.501
I'm taking this seriously

16:43.503 --> 16:45.136
because I think
it's serious, Ben.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.073
Right.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.974
I'm not gonna do anything

16:49.976 --> 16:51.009
that's not in your
best interest.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.144
I know, I know.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.851
[Maria] Okay, breathe.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.986
(Lisa and Maria
inhale and exhale)

17:01.988 --> 17:03.321
Let it out, let
some sound out.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.390
(Lisa and Maria groan)

17:05.392 --> 17:07.125
Yes, yes, pump
it up, pump it up!

17:07.127 --> 17:08.127
Maria?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.094
Um...

17:10.096 --> 17:11.295
What are you doing?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.897
I'm, what would
you call this, Jules?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.165
This is absurd.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.768
Jules, you've made your point.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.169
You have anything else to add?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.171
You say what you
need to say, Jules.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.607
I am right here,
I've got your back.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.875
Okay.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.809
I mean he hasn't
changed his mind,

17:24.810 --> 17:26.077
so yeah say it, don't say it.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.112
Just wrap it up and get out.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.750
Well Rachel, I do
have more to say.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.685
But I didn't plan
it out or anything,

17:34.687 --> 17:36.387
I feel like really
on the spot right now

17:36.389 --> 17:38.656
and I feel like it would work
better in a more supportive

17:38.658 --> 17:40.491
and less tense environment.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.261
Oh, shit.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.365
Hey guys.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.766
Hey Ben.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.402
Everybody.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.443
Don't let me interrupt, I guess.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.580
You're not, Jules and
Maria were just leaving.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.848
Okay.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.316
We were not.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.617
Okay.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.553
Ben is understandably
in shock,

18:08.555 --> 18:10.388
can you help me
walk these two out?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.656
What's going on?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.858
It is a little bit
complicated, Bobby.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.029
Actually no, it's
not that complicated.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.832
I want to talk to Ben
and she won't let me.

18:20.834 --> 18:21.834
Right.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.535
Wait, why are you here?

18:24.537 --> 18:25.803
Ben, why is she here?

18:25.805 --> 18:27.839
This, this scenario
does not seem right,

18:27.841 --> 18:30.208
you two have a history
together and her being here,

18:30.210 --> 18:33.211
- that's off.
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.712
How do you even know
where Ben lives?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.614
It's not that
hard to find out.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.783
Yeah, that doesn't help.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.617
I asked Lauren.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.885
Lauren Lauren?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.320
Yeah.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.555
I'll deal with her tomorrow.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.958
This all sounds really off.

18:48.061 --> 18:51.195
Well, maybe but
Ben is an adult

18:51.197 --> 18:52.763
and if he wants to talk to me,

18:52.765 --> 18:54.665
then he is allowed to.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.134
Right.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.736
What... Bobby, what good
could come of them talking?

18:58.738 --> 19:02.440
I don't know, closure over
past stuff between them,

19:02.442 --> 19:03.541
why am I the...

19:04.410 --> 19:05.776
What were you hoping for?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.880
Bobby, you got it right.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.716
It's closure, closure
over past stuff.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.851
Nope, she's hoping
to stop the wedding.

19:14.921 --> 19:15.921
Is that true?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.023
Not necessarily.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.559
But it seems like that
might be what's going on here.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.793
It is.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.696
Jules, you shouldn't
break up a wedding.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.764
I know that this seems...

19:26.766 --> 19:28.299
Do you though?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.601
'Cause you're kinda trying to
break up a wedding right now.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.170
No, Bobby, wrong.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.173
I'm in love with Ben, okay?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.808
I love you, and I think
that he's in love with me

19:37.810 --> 19:39.310
and I don't think
that's something

19:39.312 --> 19:41.078
that should be thrown away
without a conversation.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.481
Yeah, but are
you not following

19:43.483 --> 19:45.483
how that might break
up the wedding.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.552
I don't know how to
explain that to you

19:47.554 --> 19:48.586
if you're not getting that.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.021
I get it!

19:51.291 --> 19:55.726
Sorry, I understand what
you're trying to say

19:55.728 --> 19:58.629
and I'm not saying that
anything has to happen.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.198
Just please don't kick us out.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.169
Okay.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.773
Well, would you be okay with
like a guest-starring role?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.974
Like is that what
you're hoping for?

20:09.976 --> 20:12.777
something that's
like unconventional?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.313
Excuse me?

20:15.315 --> 20:19.951
Okay, so there's Lisa and Ben
and then there's Jules as...

20:21.654 --> 20:23.287
I don't want to say a side dish
because that seems reductive

20:23.289 --> 20:25.089
but not main course food item...

20:25.091 --> 20:26.091
Bobby!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.292
What are you doing?

20:28.294 --> 20:30.628
Troubleshooting,
brainstorming.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.462
What are you doing?

20:31.464 --> 20:32.396
Oh, I have no idea.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.131
Yeah, I could see that.

20:34.133 --> 20:39.203
Ben, I just want to talk to
you alone for five minutes.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.472
Okay, okay, let's
just go to the bedroom.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.175
- No, no, no, no!
- Oh my God!

20:45.245 --> 20:46.377
If you're gonna talk privately,

20:46.379 --> 20:47.645
you're gonna do it on the porch.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.146
It's called a pergola.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.982
Well, whatever it is,
you're gonna talk out there

20:50.984 --> 20:53.918
so we can watch and make
sure that nothing happens.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.454
We're just gonna talk.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.790
No, Bobby, can you please
help me kick these two out?

20:59.792 --> 21:01.459
It's a good question.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.660
Physically I'm capable...

21:02.662 --> 21:04.262
Bobby!

21:04.264 --> 21:05.463
I have the capability, but
in practical terms there's...

21:05.465 --> 21:06.664
It's not the time
to be practical.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.000
Well, it would
be very unbecoming.

21:09.002 --> 21:09.900
Oh Bobby.

21:09.902 --> 21:10.902
Yeah.

21:12.171 --> 21:15.273
Okay, why is Ben
not in charge here?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.276
Ben?

21:18.278 --> 21:19.443
- Ben.
- Ben.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.980
(wistful piano music)

21:26.486 --> 21:29.086
Alright, come on, let's go.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.054
No, I...

21:30.056 --> 21:31.056
Fine.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.657
They're going to the porch.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.158
Okay.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
(sliding door opens and closes)

21:38.064 --> 21:39.064
Okay.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.401
Cool lamps.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.204
Okay, what do you wanna say?

21:48.174 --> 21:49.174
Um...

21:50.743 --> 21:53.844
I didn't map it out
point by point, so...

21:53.846 --> 21:56.147
Well, you never map
it out point by point.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.149
Okay.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.250
So...

22:00.853 --> 22:02.153
When I left you...

22:02.155 --> 22:04.422
After two years
of being together.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.424
Yeah.

22:08.928 --> 22:09.928
I'm sorry.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.998
I never said that to you.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.467
You deserved to hear it.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.039
And you really deserve to know
that it hurt me to hurt you.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.675
Well, it all worked
out so thank you.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.711
But you don't need to worry.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.646
I really am happy now.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.748
This all just got so
real when I found out

22:30.750 --> 22:32.383
that you were getting
married, you know.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.654
'Cause I always just felt
like you were out there,

22:37.724 --> 22:39.590
and something would
bring us back together.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.526
And I never approached you
because it just felt too raw.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.261
Jules, I can't, I can't.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.264
Why?

22:48.401 --> 22:51.068
Why, you left and I don't
understand why you did it.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.238
I freaked out.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.474
I never had anything
like what we had,

22:58.277 --> 23:00.144
and I didn't know
how to maintain it.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.281
And I got scared
and it was just...

23:04.283 --> 23:05.249
What are you doing?

23:05.251 --> 23:06.617
You have a bug in your hair.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.551
What?

23:07.553 --> 23:08.352
You have a bug in your hair.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.286
Oh my God, get it out.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.388
Relax, stop, don't be a baby.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.322
Get it out!

23:11.324 --> 23:12.790
(Bobby knocks on the window)

23:12.792 --> 23:13.824
Lisa!

23:13.826 --> 23:14.658
What?

23:14.660 --> 23:15.660
Lisa!

23:16.662 --> 23:17.995
(sliding door opens)

23:21.134 --> 23:22.400
Lisa.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.167
You need someone to
bring you up to speed?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.168
Give me a second.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.170
Okay.

23:26.806 --> 23:30.741
Okay, Ben, maybe I could
talk to you for a minute?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.977
Yeah, yeah, I think...

23:33.946 --> 23:35.546
Not right here, okay?

23:36.949 --> 23:37.949
Okay.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.318
Okay.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.754
Okay.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.122
Yeah.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.258
Okay, first of all, hi.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.260
Hi.

23:50.396 --> 23:51.595
You smell like smoke.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.264
I just bummed one
on the way home.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.365
That's it, I promise.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.169
So what the hell is going on?

23:58.171 --> 24:00.604
I walked home and I was
making myself a drink,

24:01.974 --> 24:05.443
one drink before bed and Jules
and Maria just showed up.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.710
They kind of barged in actually.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.012
I've been trying to
get 'em to leave.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.214
And Jules is
like here for you.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.016
She's like here to do that?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.050
I think so.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.453
Are you done?

24:15.455 --> 24:18.956
No, Rachel, I'm
not done, okay?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.858
We didn't even get to talk.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.628
She's here, it's
over, they're talking.

24:24.630 --> 24:28.098
Jules, this is real life,
you can't just run around

24:28.100 --> 24:29.467
doing things this way.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.202
Okay, I know that
this is real life,

24:31.204 --> 24:33.137
that's actually why I'm
doing this, Rachel, okay?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.839
I'm carpe dieming, I'm...

24:37.243 --> 24:38.843
What?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.611
I don't know, I came
here to talk to Ben

24:40.613 --> 24:43.047
and I've like cool stuff to say

24:43.049 --> 24:45.182
and I don't really want to
waste it on you, so sorry.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.323
Thank you.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.624
I feel bad you came over.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.860
I asked Rachel not to
call you and Bobby.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.827
No, no, it's fine.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.095
I mean I'm glad that I'm here.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.630
It's not really the kind
of thing I want to hear

24:59.632 --> 25:01.398
about after the fact.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
Right.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.504
So can we just like
hang out here together?

25:06.506 --> 25:08.305
Assume Rachel can take
care of the situation?

25:08.307 --> 25:12.009
Rachel has a way
of escalating things.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.144
So I think we should
take care of it.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.012
Oh no.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.313
Yeah, come on.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.781
But you're not mad?

25:17.783 --> 25:20.551
No, I mean I'm not
like happy or whatever

25:20.553 --> 25:23.087
but honestly, it's
just another thing.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.422
Okay, do you wanna strategize?

25:25.424 --> 25:28.492
No, I think you need to
just tell Jules to leave,

25:28.494 --> 25:30.127
that she's being inappropriate.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.629
I kinda tried that already.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.732
Maybe if you tried
to talk to her?

25:34.734 --> 25:36.901
Oh, you need me to
do your dirty work?

25:36.903 --> 25:39.003
You're just a lot better
at that stuff than I am.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.572
And honestly, what's the
point of marrying you if...

25:41.574 --> 25:45.109
Stop, you are like on
the edge of trouble, man.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.278
You're not in trouble
because I do feel like

25:47.280 --> 25:48.512
this legitimately
isn't your fault

25:48.514 --> 25:51.315
but you're right on the
edge, don't get cocky.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.449
Okay.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.553
Okay.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.388
But maybe you could talk
to her and see how it goes.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.256
(sighs) Fine.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.090
Please.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.225
Yeah, okay.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.862
Thank you, my very
sweet soon-to-be-wife.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.397
I appreciate everything you do.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.666
- Yeah, you better.
- I do.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.803
Should I put some
music on or something?

26:12.805 --> 26:13.904
Yeah, what do you have?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.739
No Bobby, we
shouldn't put music on.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.709
We should forcibly remove
these two, please help me.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.178
Hey Jules.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.546
Hi.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.282
Do you want to tell
me why you're here?

26:25.284 --> 26:26.284
Um...

26:27.386 --> 26:31.622
I am here to talk to
Ben about something.

26:31.624 --> 26:35.159
Right, you want to tell me?

26:39.732 --> 26:41.632
Actually I don't think
that would be a good idea.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.400
No, right, I agree.

26:43.402 --> 26:48.472
I just, what I'm trying to do
right now is I'm trying to see

26:49.508 --> 26:52.276
if there's any way
that this is not as bad

26:52.278 --> 26:53.944
as I think it is.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.581
I think it probably is
as bad as you think it is.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.084
Okay, well things have
been kind of crazy recently

27:00.086 --> 27:02.086
with the wedding tomorrow
with like friends and family

27:02.088 --> 27:03.954
coming from out of town,
maybe I'm distracted,

27:03.956 --> 27:05.189
maybe I'm just not getting it.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.192
You wanna walk me through it?

27:09.161 --> 27:13.097
Okay, um, okay, yes.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.835
I think that it is
great that you and Ben

27:17.837 --> 27:20.104
have been having such
a good time, you know

27:20.106 --> 27:22.606
and all these really good
times that you had probably

27:22.608 --> 27:27.678
is why this wedding seemed
to be like a good idea, okay.

27:28.814 --> 27:33.217
I think that you and Ben
are good for each other

27:34.487 --> 27:36.987
on some level and I actually
think it's beautiful

27:36.989 --> 27:39.056
when people can
cross-pollinize each other...

27:39.058 --> 27:40.058
What?

27:43.796 --> 27:45.596
I don't know what
you want me to say.

27:45.598 --> 27:50.200
I'm in love with him, and I
think that he loves me too.

27:50.202 --> 27:54.405
So yeah, I thought that I could
let this happen but I can't.

27:54.407 --> 27:57.741
And Ben, he's what?

27:57.743 --> 28:00.377
He's like reciprocated?

28:00.379 --> 28:01.578
No.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.615
Okay.

28:04.617 --> 28:07.184
So, you shouldn't
be mad at him.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.186
I'm not mad at him.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.188
[Jules] Okay.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.894
I might need to sleep
on your couch tonight.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.129
Why?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.965
I built this new
like fold up Murphy bed

28:21.967 --> 28:23.400
and I can't get it to open.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.404
I was like that's what I was
doing before Rachel called.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.474
I was trying to pull
it down, it's stuck.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.543
And I don't wanna
sleep on the floor.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.211
I was gonna call anyway but...

28:34.213 --> 28:35.446
I mean...

28:35.448 --> 28:36.380
I'll sleep on the
floor, it's fine.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.347
No, no, you can stay here.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.382
Of course you can stay here.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.285
Well, I mean if this whole...

28:41.287 --> 28:43.353
Okay, she's not
making any sense.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.822
I agree.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.058
How, how, how can a person
say something like that?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.660
Well, I am quite a catch.

28:49.662 --> 28:51.695
I want you to let
Jules do what she wants.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.230
And why would I do that?

28:53.232 --> 28:56.266
Because she's my friend and
that's what I want to happen.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.769
Well, I want something
different to happen.

28:58.771 --> 29:03.140
Interesting, a real dilemma.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.576
Listen, alright, I'm
just gonna go on the record

29:05.578 --> 29:07.778
as saying that
Lisa is the catch.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.214
Somebody should be breaking
in her hotel room right now

29:10.216 --> 29:11.682
to stop her from marrying you.

29:11.684 --> 29:12.516
Mm.

29:12.518 --> 29:13.518
Yeah.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.353
(sliding door opens and closes)

29:16.355 --> 29:17.821
You know, that's probably
happening right now.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.556
Yeah, it probably is.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.458
I mean it definitely is.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.093
They're breaking,
maybe multiple exes.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.430
Yeah, definitely
multiple exes.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.998
They're breaking in but
luckily you're not there.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.334
Yeah, but I wonder what
would happen if I were there?

29:30.336 --> 29:33.170
I mean they might convince me.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.139
Yeah, I guess I
have to thank Jules.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.841
No, don't do that.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.409
No, don't worry.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.212
(piano music)

29:43.449 --> 29:44.681
You're wearing it,
do you like it?

29:44.683 --> 29:47.484
Yes, I love it,
it's beautiful.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.721
I can't believe your Nana
was willing to part with it.

29:50.723 --> 29:53.557
Well, I am her favorite
and you're a part of that.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.527
Mm-hmm, I read your note too.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.429
I love the way you write,

30:00.699 --> 30:02.232
especially when it's for me.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.135
Did you open mine?

30:05.137 --> 30:07.538
No, not yet, I'm sorry.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.239
Just all this chaos.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.241
Yeah.

30:14.013 --> 30:17.981
So I think your original idea
about just like hiding out

30:17.983 --> 30:20.317
was not the worst strategy.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.518
Right?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.953
Yeah, she has crossed
some kind of rubicon

30:22.955 --> 30:24.521
and I don't like it.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.925
Rachel, where's
the eject button?

30:27.927 --> 30:28.759
I only have vinyl.

30:28.761 --> 30:30.427
(sliding door closes)

30:30.429 --> 30:31.795
That's not a CD player.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.697
[Jules] Ben. Ben?

30:35.100 --> 30:38.602
Jules, look, we talked and
I gotta be honest with you,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.938
- we're...
- Flummoxed.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.439
Yeah, we're flummoxed.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.942
- I did not see this coming.
- This is very weird.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.344
I know, I didn't think that
there would be so many people.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.913
I just envisioned it
would be you and me.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.416
Yeah, but it's not just
about us, Jules, okay?

30:52.418 --> 30:53.851
There are other people
that are impacted

30:53.853 --> 30:55.118
by this sort of thing.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.587
Okay, but who cares
about those people?

30:56.589 --> 30:58.755
It is about just us, okay?

30:58.757 --> 31:00.157
And we need to talk.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.359
Are you serious?

31:02.361 --> 31:04.628
I don't know any other
way to end it, okay?

31:04.630 --> 31:05.996
I mean it'll only take a minute.

31:05.998 --> 31:06.964
I'll let her talk and we'll talk

31:06.966 --> 31:08.165
and then we'll all go to bed.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.534
Yes, he's being fair.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.870
What could you have to say
that you haven't already said?

31:12.872 --> 31:16.106
Look, if you and
I talk in private,

31:16.108 --> 31:17.774
that'll be it, right?

31:17.776 --> 31:18.609
Yes.

31:18.611 --> 31:19.710
Great, let's go.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.178
Ben, what are you doing?

31:21.180 --> 31:22.946
It's the only way
she's gonna leave.

31:22.948 --> 31:26.149
I don't think that's right
and I am not comfortable

31:26.151 --> 31:27.517
with this, am I overstepping?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.186
I'm just gonna listen to her.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.988
No, I don't understand why
you have to listen to her.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.789
I am starting to get
a little frustrated.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.325
Okay, Ben outside,
Lisa kitchen.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.860
I'll be there in a second.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.564
Bobby, watch these two.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.735
(sliding door closes)

31:49.808 --> 31:51.308
Rachel, what are you doing?

31:51.310 --> 31:53.510
I'm going to
talk to Lisa, okay?

31:53.512 --> 31:54.778
Rachel.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.147
I get it, you don't
want to be the bad guy.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.181
That's not you.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.750
Exactly.

31:59.752 --> 32:04.288
Yeah, but you're saying
things that are bad, okay?

32:04.290 --> 32:07.190
So I think it's best
if you stay quiet

32:07.192 --> 32:08.859
for a little bit, alright?

32:08.861 --> 32:10.928
I'm gonna try to calm Lisa down

32:10.930 --> 32:13.964
and then I'll get Jules
and Maria outta here

32:13.966 --> 32:17.401
and I'll try to keep things
from getting any worse.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.503
But Rachel, I think sometimes
your approach can be like...

32:19.505 --> 32:23.840
I push a little hard but
I can handle this, okay?

32:23.842 --> 32:27.678
I understand what's going
on, and I know you can't,

32:27.680 --> 32:28.845
am I right?

32:28.847 --> 32:29.680
Well, I...

32:29.682 --> 32:30.682
I'm right.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.886
(sliding door opens)

32:38.057 --> 32:39.057
Okay.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.161
Okay, I just wanted to give
everyone a little time out

32:44.163 --> 32:46.930
because it felt like
things were going sideways.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.465
So I wanted to pump the brakes.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.268
Yeah, I did feel like things
were going a little sideways.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.737
Yeah, because...

32:54.873 --> 32:57.708
Because you're taking
Ben literally right now

32:57.710 --> 33:00.110
and that's why a lot of
this is sounding so bad.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.913
I'm taking him literally
because he's being literal.

33:02.915 --> 33:05.182
Ben's not an idiot, right?

33:05.184 --> 33:06.516
I mean he couldn't,

33:06.518 --> 33:08.919
He couldn't be so
stupid or insensitive

33:08.921 --> 33:11.221
as he might seem, let's
just rule that out.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.458
- Let's rule that out?
- Fine.

33:15.794 --> 33:16.794
He's just...

33:17.997 --> 33:21.198
He's just mollifying, that's it.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.567
You know, it's how people talk.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.002
Most of the time we
talk about nothing,

33:25.004 --> 33:26.269
and it's nicer that way,

33:26.271 --> 33:28.472
- more pleasant that way.
- Okay.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.074
Then you get in a
situation like this,

33:31.076 --> 33:34.945
and you just have
to zip through it,

33:34.947 --> 33:37.047
let it all spill out
and when it's done,

33:37.049 --> 33:38.915
you bury it, forget it.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.420
If we can just get through
the next 10 minutes,

33:43.422 --> 33:45.455
I promise you and
Ben will be happy

33:45.457 --> 33:47.190
and everything will be great.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.458
I just don't
understand why he's not...

33:48.460 --> 33:50.827
Jules has put him in a
really tricky spot here.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.797
He's being way too nice,

33:55.034 --> 33:59.136
which is something he says

33:59.138 --> 34:01.905
in job interviews is a weakness
but at a time like this,

34:01.907 --> 34:03.640
it actually is a weakness.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.410
He can't say the things
that he wants to say

34:06.412 --> 34:09.880
because he doesn't
want to hurt anyone.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.583
But I've known him forever and
you know him and he's good...

34:13.585 --> 34:15.085
I'm freaking out, Rach.

34:15.087 --> 34:16.719
No, you don't have to
freak out here, this is...

34:16.722 --> 34:18.789
You know what, I
can just ask him.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.893
(sliding door closes)

34:23.896 --> 34:25.429
What are you doing?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.496
I didn't know what
was taking so long.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.764
No, not that, this.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.400
Lisa, relax.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.303
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.806
Oh, really? How's that?

34:38.310 --> 34:41.978
Every year I go out to
Joshua Tree for a long weekend,

34:41.980 --> 34:45.282
and I just sort of hike and
trip and listen to music,

34:45.284 --> 34:47.083
I was just there
like two weekends ago

34:47.085 --> 34:49.719
and everything is beautiful.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.188
I am tripping four ways.

34:51.190 --> 34:54.357
You know, extra dimensions,
wild animals, aliens,

34:54.359 --> 34:55.559
the whole thing.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.328
I'm sorry, what are
you talking about?

34:58.330 --> 35:01.565
I wrecked my phone, I
dropped it in the water

35:01.567 --> 35:03.033
at Barker Dam.

35:03.035 --> 35:06.002
And at first I was really upset.

35:06.004 --> 35:10.407
But then I went to the Apple
store and in like five minutes

35:10.409 --> 35:11.441
I had a new one.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.511
Everything was backed up.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.513
Okay.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.581
Do you get it?

35:17.583 --> 35:19.149
It's an extended metaphor.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.518
Oh, I don't think the
comparison really tracks.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.619
The phone is Ben.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.254
Yeah, no, I
understand the metaphor,

35:24.256 --> 35:26.022
I just don't really think that

35:26.024 --> 35:29.559
if I lost my fiancee on the
night before our wedding,

35:29.561 --> 35:33.396
I would immediately be
able to replace him.

35:33.398 --> 35:34.798
I don't think
you're getting it.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.367
So what I'm saying is
it's okay, just relax

35:37.369 --> 35:41.071
because it's fine if
you and Ben uncouple.

35:41.073 --> 35:44.141
Yeah, look, can everyone
just be quiet for a second?

35:44.143 --> 35:46.176
Now, there's no reason why
we can't clear all this up.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.712
So Jules, do you
understand that Lisa and I

35:48.714 --> 35:50.313
are getting married tomorrow?

35:50.315 --> 35:51.148
Maybe.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.382
Maria!

35:52.384 --> 35:53.950
What? It's not a
maybe at this point?

35:53.952 --> 35:55.385
Jules, do you understand?

35:56.722 --> 35:57.654
Do you have something you'd
like to say in addition

35:57.656 --> 35:59.055
to what you've already said?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.293
Okay, and Lisa, that's
why you're getting

36:03.295 --> 36:05.061
a little more upset
because it's disrespectful

36:05.063 --> 36:06.296
and I've been going
along with that

36:06.298 --> 36:08.098
and it's just not a
great thing to do?

36:08.934 --> 36:09.833
Yes.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.035
Okay, great.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.906
So you know, the point
is now that we all know

36:15.908 --> 36:17.841
we're angry at someone.

36:17.843 --> 36:21.578
So Jules, can you just say
what you've come to say quickly

36:21.580 --> 36:23.780
and leave so the rest of
us can start apologizing

36:23.782 --> 36:25.048
to one another?

36:26.451 --> 36:29.819
Yes, yeah, that's all that
I want to do is talk to you.

36:29.821 --> 36:30.821
Okay.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.866
Right now?

36:42.868 --> 36:45.202
Yeah, just whenever
you're ready.

36:53.879 --> 36:54.879
Okay.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.182
Ben.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.220
(wistful guitar music)

37:04.289 --> 37:06.957
Ben, we had something
special, okay?

37:06.959 --> 37:09.159
We have something special.

37:09.161 --> 37:12.062
And yes, I screwed it up, okay?

37:12.064 --> 37:16.266
Yes, we had problems
but I'm here now, okay?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.467
Because it was real.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.736
It's real, it is
the most real thing

37:19.738 --> 37:21.705
that I've ever felt
and it's more real

37:21.707 --> 37:24.741
than anything you could ever
have with anyone else, okay?

37:24.743 --> 37:27.477
And that's why it's worth
fighting for, right?

37:27.479 --> 37:30.280
That's why it's
worth stopping this.

37:33.986 --> 37:37.254
Okay, okay. Okay.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.058
Okay.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.363
Jules, I didn't love
you more than I love Lisa.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.199
Well, that's not
exactly what I said.

37:49.201 --> 37:50.467
Well, you kind of did.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.735
I have a lot of shitty
feelings about the way

37:51.737 --> 37:53.570
that we broke up and
I think that like...

37:53.572 --> 37:54.804
Why are you engaging?

37:54.806 --> 37:56.673
We didn't finish
talking outside.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.241
Okay, so you left
because you didn't know

37:58.243 --> 38:00.076
how to maintain a relationship?

38:00.078 --> 38:01.144
You freaked out?

38:02.247 --> 38:03.847
I honestly don't know
what that means, Jules.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.415
It sounds like a cop-out to me.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.318
I mean I tried to find you,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.587
I tried to track you down,
I tried to just find you

38:10.589 --> 38:12.722
and talk to you and so,
just like bump into you.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.190
Ben.

38:14.192 --> 38:16.059
I don't think this is really
the time to go into this.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.661
Okay, well it's
not a cop-out, okay?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.763
It's how I felt and
that's why I'm here.

38:19.765 --> 38:20.897
I'm trying to explain.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.165
Explain what?

38:23.602 --> 38:25.935
That you love me and
that you still love me?

38:25.937 --> 38:29.005
But at one point there for
some reason you crushed me.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.910
I loved you so much.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.412
Nope.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.414
(Jules gasps)

38:37.416 --> 38:38.581
Rachel, I...

38:41.853 --> 38:43.320
Rachel, are you done?

38:43.322 --> 38:45.322
There's a possibility
that I am done.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.757
What does that mean?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.160
We shouldn't be fighting, Ben.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.462
We're not fighting,
you're just slapping me.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.130
Okay, it's part of
being the best man

38:54.132 --> 38:56.232
and maybe if you get
to be Bobby's best man,

38:56.234 --> 38:58.968
you'll understand that times
come up where the best man

38:58.970 --> 39:02.505
has to step up and knock
some sense into people.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.840
We are shutting down

39:03.842 --> 39:06.276
this little therapy
session here, alright?

39:06.278 --> 39:08.778
Jules, congratulations
you have successfully

39:08.780 --> 39:10.013
marred a wedding.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.615
Thank you for being
so awful and selfish.

39:12.617 --> 39:15.051
Everyone else thank
you for showing up

39:15.053 --> 39:17.387
in strange auxiliary roles.

39:17.389 --> 39:21.558
And Ben you don't get to hash
shit out with your ex tonight.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.261
Look, Jules, I think that I...

39:25.263 --> 39:26.062
Damn it!

39:26.064 --> 39:27.097
Fascism.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.232
I call fascism on Rachel.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.000
I'm not a fascist.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.502
- Jules.
- Yes.

39:32.504 --> 39:36.740
Honestly, you were the one
open-ended thing in my life.

39:38.110 --> 39:42.312
You're the question mark
and this was long overdue,

39:42.314 --> 39:43.680
- but I really...
- Done?

39:46.385 --> 39:47.951
Sure.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.986
I get what you're
trying to do.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.721
You're trying to protect people,

39:52.824 --> 39:54.724
but you have to
think about yourself.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.360
I think maybe we
should call it a night.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.362
How can you say that?

39:59.364 --> 40:01.064
Call it a night?

40:01.066 --> 40:03.700
You're gonna ruin
your life and why?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.735
To make a bunch of
people feel less awkward?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.404
How is he ruining his life?

40:07.406 --> 40:09.172
Marrying Lisa
would ruin his life.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.407
No offense, Lisa, you're great.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.175
Kind of hard not
to be offended.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.879
Babe, we were doing just
fine, before they all got here.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.647
This is all your fault,
you guys should be ashamed

40:17.649 --> 40:19.115
of yourselves for doing this.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.419
Okay Jules, you and me,
let's go talk in the kitchen.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.574
I know this is a
difficult situation.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.276
Shitty actually.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.815
I feel like I
jumped out of a plane,

40:51.817 --> 40:54.717
and really the only thing
left for us to do right now

40:56.955 --> 40:59.289
is ride that out.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.624
I really am sorry
but I'm doing this,

41:01.626 --> 41:05.428
and actually probably
it's best for us

41:05.430 --> 41:06.763
to really hash this out tonight.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.131
Jules, be quiet.

41:11.002 --> 41:15.038
I have a lot of rage
inside of me right now.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.510
I'm trying to process it
before I start talking to you.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.413
This is bad.

41:23.415 --> 41:24.914
Yeah, I hear that.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.783
What's making it worse is
you not kicking Jules out.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.819
Honestly Rach, I think
you're making it worse.

41:29.821 --> 41:30.987
Stay out of this.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.489
I think everybody's
making it worse.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.991
What is wrong with you that
you won't just kick her out?

41:34.993 --> 41:37.861
He tried, things just
keep happening too quickly.

41:37.863 --> 41:41.364
At this point, we are all
here and I don't see a problem

41:41.366 --> 41:42.532
with hearing her out.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.269
What good could come
of hearing her out?

41:46.271 --> 41:49.506
Well, broadly it would
be sort of an epic story

41:49.508 --> 41:51.841
of redemption if she
could win Ben over.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.676
Okay, I don't think
that's realistic

41:53.678 --> 41:56.145
and it probably doesn't
help my case with you so...

41:56.147 --> 41:57.413
No, it doesn't.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.649
So I would go back
to the closure thing.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.485
Wouldn't it be great
if Ben got some closure

42:02.487 --> 42:04.053
after all this time?

42:04.055 --> 42:07.757
Seems like there's a lot of
unresolved stuff going on.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.260
(uneasy percussion)

42:13.565 --> 42:14.497
What are you doing?

42:14.499 --> 42:15.899
Just looking for a glass.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.000
It's one more over.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.382
Okay, I thought about it.

42:38.957 --> 42:42.792
I have put myself in your shoes.

42:44.829 --> 42:48.431
I think I understand
where you're coming from

42:48.433 --> 42:51.367
and why you're doing
what you're doing.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.269
I would never do
something like this.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.571
Well, you don't really know...

42:54.573 --> 42:56.606
No, we're not
doing that, Jules.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.008
You are going to go home.

43:01.413 --> 43:02.812
You're not gonna
say goodbye to Ben,

43:02.814 --> 43:05.014
you're not gonna say
anything else to anyone else,

43:05.016 --> 43:07.550
you are going to walk away.

43:09.588 --> 43:10.987
Lisa, I jumped
out of the plane.

43:10.989 --> 43:12.822
I don't care.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.357
I'm very sick of this.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.392
I should be in bed
trying to fall asleep

43:16.394 --> 43:19.128
and instead I'm here
dealing with you.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.497
Do you think that's fair?

43:21.499 --> 43:23.032
Well, that's not the point.

43:24.469 --> 43:29.072
If you were me, wouldn't
you want you to go home?

43:30.208 --> 43:31.208
Yes.

43:32.611 --> 43:35.778
Wouldn't you think you
were doing a terrible thing?

43:35.780 --> 43:37.513
- Yes.
- So go.

43:37.515 --> 43:38.681
But what if I'm right?

43:39.751 --> 43:42.151
I know that I'm
in love with Ben.

43:42.153 --> 43:43.419
And what if he's
in love with me?

43:43.421 --> 43:45.054
Isn't it better to
find out tonight?

43:45.056 --> 43:47.690
That wouldn't make
what you're doing

43:47.692 --> 43:49.559
any less of a terrible...

43:49.561 --> 43:51.194
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

43:51.196 --> 43:54.097
If Ben is in love with me,
wouldn't it be better to find out

43:54.099 --> 43:56.566
right now, tonight,
before tomorrow?

43:56.568 --> 43:57.834
I don't think you
can argue with that.

43:57.836 --> 43:59.068
I can't?

43:59.070 --> 44:00.336
No.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.871
I think I can
argue against that

44:01.873 --> 44:05.141
and I think you do have a
problem with me at minimum,

44:05.143 --> 44:08.077
I have a very big
problem with you.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.512
Right, that's fair.

44:09.514 --> 44:10.446
[Lisa] Ugh.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.081
Okay, Ben got his closure.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.784
If Jules wanted closure,
she shouldn't have ended

44:14.786 --> 44:17.887
the relationship
by ghosting him.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.456
It was awful watching him
sulk around for three months

44:20.458 --> 44:22.358
trying to find her,
stalking her online.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.826
Wait, three months?

44:23.828 --> 44:26.963
Ben, you were stalking
somebody for three months?

44:26.965 --> 44:28.264
You didn't think to
bring that up with me?

44:28.266 --> 44:30.366
You were going through
your Becca situation.

44:30.368 --> 44:31.668
My Becca situation?

44:31.670 --> 44:32.502
Not now, Bobby.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.771
You were dating Becca?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.540
Yes.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.710
Bobby, you and Becca
would have never worked out.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.713
I mean you're fine
but Becca's like,

44:44.983 --> 44:46.449
she's not for you.

44:46.451 --> 44:47.717
It sounds like
you're saying that

44:47.719 --> 44:49.185
in the worst way possible.

44:49.187 --> 44:53.056
I'm saying it like your
physical attractiveness levels

44:53.058 --> 44:54.157
don't match well.

44:55.527 --> 44:58.661
And I don't think you'd be
able to handle her sexually.

44:58.663 --> 45:01.698
I don't know what
to do here, Jules.

45:01.700 --> 45:06.135
I tried being cool but I don't
feel like doing that anymore.

45:06.137 --> 45:10.039
I mean you just, you keep
asking to like talk to Ben

45:10.041 --> 45:11.641
for just a little while
and it sounds like

45:11.643 --> 45:13.843
this tiny reasonable request...

45:13.845 --> 45:15.344
Yes, thank you.

45:15.346 --> 45:16.946
You know that it's not,
you're just gonna stay here

45:16.948 --> 45:18.948
and keep stirring
things up until...

45:18.950 --> 45:21.517
I don't really know what's going
through your head actually.

45:21.519 --> 45:26.155
Until Ben decides he loves
you and you two run off

45:26.157 --> 45:27.590
and get married?

45:27.592 --> 45:29.358
Okay, well, I mean, I
don't, that's not gonna happen

45:29.360 --> 45:31.394
'cause I don't really believe
in traditional marriage.

45:31.396 --> 45:32.662
Ugh!

45:32.664 --> 45:34.224
You know what, I'm
gonna kick her out.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.134
Fascist! Fascist!

45:38.136 --> 45:39.869
Resist!

45:39.871 --> 45:41.804
You know what, I
am really hopped up

45:41.806 --> 45:45.041
on adrenaline right now because
I'm finally being honest

45:45.043 --> 45:46.709
with myself, okay?
(Bobby and Maria yelling)

45:46.711 --> 45:49.045
And I'm always running
away and I'm gonna stick...

45:49.047 --> 45:50.646
[Maria] Oh I got a foot cramp!

45:51.750 --> 45:54.684
This is an emergency!
This is an emergency!

45:54.686 --> 45:55.618
What is happening?

45:55.620 --> 45:56.853
Why are you allowing this?

45:56.855 --> 45:58.654
What is happening?

46:00.792 --> 46:02.008
[Maria] It's bad.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.225
Ben, you have to do
something about this.

46:03.228 --> 46:05.795
Get your crazy ex-girlfriend
out of my house.

46:05.797 --> 46:06.996
I'm trying.

46:06.998 --> 46:08.631
Trying, Ben,
what are we doing?

46:08.633 --> 46:10.633
I am trying to be honest.

46:10.635 --> 46:12.101
So am I.

46:12.103 --> 46:13.536
No, I'm not saying that
you're not trying to be honest

46:13.538 --> 46:15.705
but I am saying how
are you not frustrated?

46:15.707 --> 46:16.639
How are you...

46:16.641 --> 46:17.907
I'm super frustrated.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.842
Okay, well then
do something, Ben.

46:19.844 --> 46:22.078
I mean like give me something.

46:23.648 --> 46:24.480
I don't know what to give you.

46:24.482 --> 46:25.982
I'm not gonna lie.

46:25.984 --> 46:28.151
Okay, well that's gonna
be a real problem, Ben.

46:28.153 --> 46:29.352
Lisa...

46:29.354 --> 46:32.755
What? What do
you want me to say?

46:32.757 --> 46:35.358
This is hurtful and surreal?

46:36.928 --> 46:39.228
I don't know, I just
want to be somewhere else.

46:43.334 --> 46:44.334
So do I.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.570
(somber guitar music)

46:48.673 --> 46:50.273
[Jules] How did you
get the foot cramp?

46:50.275 --> 46:52.208
Stop asking
that, I don't know.

46:52.210 --> 46:54.610
Not enough potassium? I
didn't go to medical school.

46:54.612 --> 46:56.646
- A banana, get her a banana.
- Push it the other way.

46:56.648 --> 46:58.080
What?

46:58.082 --> 46:59.315
Whatever way you pushed
it to make it cramp

46:59.317 --> 47:00.249
Push it the other
way and it'll stop.

47:00.251 --> 47:01.684
Will that work?

47:01.686 --> 47:02.919
Where's Ben?

47:05.190 --> 47:07.323
I thought that
was the end there.

47:08.359 --> 47:10.760
Jules, I almost died.

47:10.762 --> 47:14.030
[Jules] I know, I'm
sorry, it's so stressful.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.572
(sighs)

47:37.689 --> 47:39.255
(door knock)

47:39.257 --> 47:40.423
Yeah.

47:40.425 --> 47:43.626
Hey, just checking
in, you okay?

47:43.628 --> 47:44.628
Yes.

47:45.997 --> 47:46.929
[Bobby] Can I
get you anything?

47:46.931 --> 47:49.966
Like a soda or something?

47:49.968 --> 47:51.367
Oh no, I'm good.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.404
Hey Ben, things are getting
a little out of hand out here.

47:55.406 --> 47:58.007
I just want to make sure
that that's on your radar.

48:00.879 --> 48:01.944
It's on my radar.

48:02.780 --> 48:03.913
[Bobby] Okay, good.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.515
Alright, well I know
it can be hard to go

48:06.517 --> 48:09.051
when someone's talking to
you so I'll leave you alone.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.420
But when you're done,

48:12.724 --> 48:15.725
we should really do
something about all this.

48:15.727 --> 48:16.926
Yeah, sounds good.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.830
[Bobby] Good, good talk.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.241
How's your foot?

48:32.243 --> 48:33.276
I mean it's okay.

48:34.746 --> 48:36.145
Lisa, are you okay?

48:36.147 --> 48:39.615
No, Rachel, I'm not okay,
not even a little bit.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.752
Jules, is there anything,
literally anything

48:42.754 --> 48:44.887
that would get you to leave?

48:44.889 --> 48:46.322
Do I need to call the cops?

48:47.358 --> 48:49.125
I haven't made
things right with Ben.

48:50.662 --> 48:55.264
And I don't think that you can
call the cops on us, right?

48:56.334 --> 48:57.934
Bobby, what else do you need?

48:59.437 --> 49:01.938
I'm sorry, I was sort of
thinking of, I didn't...

49:01.940 --> 49:02.872
What was the question?

49:02.874 --> 49:03.906
I mean what else do you need?

49:03.908 --> 49:05.007
Jules is here...

49:05.009 --> 49:07.176
Oh, Ben, what happened?

49:07.178 --> 49:08.511
Were you crying in there?

49:10.114 --> 49:11.914
No, I wasn't crying.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.115
Were you crying the whole
time you were in there,

49:13.117 --> 49:14.417
when you were talking to me?

49:14.419 --> 49:16.919
What does it matter,
can we just drop it?

49:16.921 --> 49:18.454
Look, I know hard
crying, alright?

49:18.456 --> 49:22.058
It is understandable, this is
a real bummer of a situation.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.926
Let's just get
this all sorted out.

49:23.928 --> 49:25.561
I'm okay.

49:25.563 --> 49:27.763
No, I'm pretty sure
that you're not okay.

49:27.765 --> 49:30.232
Isn't everybody
overwhelmed at this point?

49:31.402 --> 49:33.469
I'm not overwhelmed.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.570
Are you sick?

49:35.473 --> 49:38.374
Did you have a difficult BM?

49:38.376 --> 49:41.444
He's crying because
of the emotional strain.

49:41.446 --> 49:44.380
Sometimes when I'm
diarrheaing, I cry.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.616
But it's not cause of
any pain, it's emotional.

49:47.618 --> 49:48.985
Is that what it was?

49:48.987 --> 49:50.186
No.

49:50.188 --> 49:52.321
Okay, you know
what, Maria, Jules,

49:52.323 --> 49:53.556
you two need to go.

49:53.558 --> 49:54.757
Bobby.

49:54.759 --> 49:56.092
No, Jules, I
think it's enough.

49:56.094 --> 49:57.994
Ben is sick now.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.295
I think you gave him a
stomach problem or something.

49:59.297 --> 50:00.296
Isn't that enough for you?

50:00.298 --> 50:01.230
I don't have a
stomach problem.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.498
Maybe I should go.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.332
No.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.934
Call it.

50:04.936 --> 50:06.135
What?

50:06.137 --> 50:07.703
(intense percussion plays)

50:09.240 --> 50:11.273
Call it, that's a breakup.

50:11.275 --> 50:13.576
That's how a breakup starts.

50:13.578 --> 50:14.677
Absolutely not.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.445
Hi, do I get a say in this?

50:16.447 --> 50:18.748
You've all been talking
over me and through me

50:18.750 --> 50:20.016
and I can't...

50:20.018 --> 50:21.250
I know where this is going.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.752
- So I guess I just...
- Stop!

50:22.754 --> 50:26.622
I'm just saying now would be
the time to do it, you guys.

50:26.624 --> 50:28.491
I'm not breaking up with her,

50:28.493 --> 50:30.459
she's not breaking up with me.

50:30.461 --> 50:33.195
Yeah Maria, stop upsetting
them, you're being cruel.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.564
Alright, that's it,
you two need to go.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.335
Here, grab your jacket, take it.

50:40.405 --> 50:42.271
Get out of here, alright?

50:43.241 --> 50:45.107
Please get home safely.

50:45.109 --> 50:46.109
Go.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.646
That's how it's done.

50:58.022 --> 50:59.722
Is anybody else hungry?

50:59.724 --> 51:01.090
What?

51:01.092 --> 51:03.492
No? Am I the only one?

51:03.494 --> 51:06.195
- Why would we eat?
- We just had dinner.

51:06.197 --> 51:07.763
I could eat.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.566
There she is, let's do this.

51:10.568 --> 51:13.803
Okay, yeah. Come on Ben.

51:18.209 --> 51:19.775
Am I doing a terrible thing?

51:21.913 --> 51:23.479
He's getting married tomorrow.

51:24.282 --> 51:26.415
So I have to do it tonight.

51:26.417 --> 51:27.850
I have to do it before...

51:31.689 --> 51:34.457
He loves me, I know it.

51:34.459 --> 51:35.459
I agree.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.828
I feel like we
should go back in now.

51:38.830 --> 51:40.196
Oh, we're going back in.

51:41.566 --> 51:43.732
It's just that when you
get kicked out of a place,

51:43.734 --> 51:45.367
you have to wait a few
minutes before you try

51:45.369 --> 51:46.969
and go back in, otherwise
you're just gonna

51:46.971 --> 51:48.070
get kicked out again.

51:50.341 --> 51:51.707
That makes sense.

51:54.278 --> 51:57.012
You're a good friend
for doing this.

51:57.014 --> 51:58.247
I know.

52:00.918 --> 52:04.620
Alright, these are, good
stock in the fridge, you guys.

52:04.622 --> 52:08.057
This is really good raw
materials, I can work with this.

52:09.861 --> 52:14.930
(sighs) Ooh man, I am glad
to be out of that, you know?

52:16.300 --> 52:20.870
Mmm, you know it was very
surprising and unfortunate.

52:22.673 --> 52:26.275
And now we can just
hang out, have a snack

52:26.277 --> 52:28.911
and just decompress
a little bit.

52:31.082 --> 52:35.050
(sighs) So stressful
in there, right?

52:36.888 --> 52:39.922
Super super stressful, right?

52:43.227 --> 52:45.528
- Lisa, look...
- Just be careful.

52:50.134 --> 52:52.268
I can, um...

52:53.871 --> 52:55.571
I can feel that there's
some tension between you two

52:55.573 --> 52:57.439
and it's understandable.

53:00.011 --> 53:01.477
Do you both acknowledge that?

53:03.714 --> 53:04.980
What?

53:04.982 --> 53:06.515
I'd like you both
to just acknowledge

53:06.517 --> 53:10.019
that there is some tension
and that it's understandable.

53:11.522 --> 53:12.522
Fine.

53:14.759 --> 53:15.759
Lisa?

53:18.529 --> 53:21.430
Yes, I acknowledge it.

53:21.432 --> 53:22.432
[Bobby] Great.

53:23.134 --> 53:24.500
(sliding door closes)

53:28.406 --> 53:29.271
What can I do for you, Maria?

53:29.273 --> 53:30.273
Shit!

53:31.976 --> 53:34.076
(stammers)

53:34.078 --> 53:36.512
I think I left something
here, I don't know,

53:36.514 --> 53:38.581
you know, I mean, just... rings,

53:38.583 --> 53:41.083
my rings fall off 'cause
my skinny fingers...

53:41.085 --> 53:42.351
Maria.

53:42.353 --> 53:44.353
Okay, I just wanna
know what happened.

53:45.756 --> 53:48.591
So where is everyone?

53:48.593 --> 53:50.893
Maria, I'm not
really in the mood.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.963
You shouldn't be here,
you should be with Jules.

53:53.965 --> 53:57.333
Ah, she'll be back, she just
needs to work up the juice.

53:57.335 --> 53:59.034
Do you want to get
kicked out again?

53:59.036 --> 54:01.503
I feel like it was a
very gentle kicking out,

54:01.505 --> 54:03.472
almost to the
point of voluntary.

54:03.474 --> 54:06.709
So I wouldn't call it
like an official kick out.

54:09.647 --> 54:11.347
I think it's best when
we talk about these things,

54:11.349 --> 54:12.648
just talk them through.

54:12.650 --> 54:16.018
Now, I think a lot of
what has gone on tonight

54:16.020 --> 54:18.787
is that communication
has not been good.

54:18.789 --> 54:19.722
Would you agree?

54:19.724 --> 54:21.357
Bobby, could you like not now?

54:22.493 --> 54:25.828
I will take that as
a yes from Ben, Lisa?

54:26.897 --> 54:29.431
Bobby, I'm hungry
and I just want to eat.

54:30.601 --> 54:31.834
Okay, but do you
agree that communication

54:31.836 --> 54:33.168
hasn't been great?

54:34.438 --> 54:35.671
Yes.

54:35.673 --> 54:39.341
Alright, now Lisa
I think that you need

54:39.343 --> 54:42.578
to take some
responsibility and I know,

54:42.580 --> 54:45.714
Ben was just trying to say
something and you shut him down,

54:45.716 --> 54:47.316
and that's not helpful.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.351
Ben has got to take
responsibility for a lot.

54:49.353 --> 54:53.022
This whole mess is his fault
and he keeps making it worse.

54:53.024 --> 54:58.093
But Lisa, you also need to
take some responsibility.

54:58.896 --> 55:00.429
Bobby, you are stepping...

55:00.431 --> 55:02.731
And you know what
Lisa, I'm excited.

55:02.733 --> 55:06.869
I'm excited because I
can already feel you

55:06.871 --> 55:09.838
having this wonderful
attitude shift.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.409
I can feel the space opening up

55:13.411 --> 55:16.345
and you are creating
a great safe space

55:16.347 --> 55:19.748
where we are going to be
able to just work this out.

55:19.750 --> 55:22.251
(soothing guitar music)

55:23.988 --> 55:26.822
We are gonna get
your blood sugar up.

55:33.364 --> 55:35.264
We're gonna sort this out.

55:35.266 --> 55:36.832
And Ben, you are
going to be careful

55:36.834 --> 55:38.334
about what you say, right?

55:39.503 --> 55:40.602
Yes.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.872
Great, good.

55:46.544 --> 55:47.676
I think this is nice.

55:49.747 --> 55:51.814
We have a nice little
bubble of safety here.

55:53.718 --> 55:56.185
We got a nice little happy
place with sandwiches

55:56.187 --> 55:58.887
and weddings and
stuff like that,

55:58.889 --> 56:00.222
and we are gonna
support each other

56:00.224 --> 56:02.391
and we are gonna talk
about our feelings.

56:04.628 --> 56:06.128
I'm just gonna finish these up

56:06.130 --> 56:08.364
and then we're gonna bring
Rachel into the bubble.

56:13.537 --> 56:15.537
So is he still leaning Lisa?

56:15.539 --> 56:18.107
You know, I want Jules to
win but if I'm being honest,

56:18.109 --> 56:19.708
it looks like Lisa.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.676
What?

56:20.678 --> 56:22.678
You remember him and Jules.

56:22.680 --> 56:25.647
They were like
mismatched and crazy

56:25.649 --> 56:26.749
but there's something about it

56:26.751 --> 56:29.551
that just never lets go of you.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.553
It's...

56:32.857 --> 56:34.356
I can't fight you on this.

56:35.359 --> 56:36.925
I don't have it in me.

56:38.295 --> 56:40.362
You're hurting my
friends, you know that?

56:40.364 --> 56:42.364
You're hurting Ben and
you're hurting Lisa.

56:42.366 --> 56:45.134
Okay, it's not great

56:45.136 --> 56:47.569
but I get to help
my friend too, Rach.

56:48.606 --> 56:53.175
It's not your job to
fix impossible problems.

56:53.177 --> 56:55.511
Don't you want friends
who look out for you?

56:55.513 --> 56:57.279
Yeah, but what's
the point of anything

56:57.281 --> 56:59.081
if you can't look
out for yourself?

57:03.087 --> 57:05.154
(sighs)

57:07.658 --> 57:11.927
So other than that, other
than tonight, how are things?

57:11.929 --> 57:13.896
Work going good for you?

57:13.898 --> 57:16.298
Are you doing small talk?

57:16.300 --> 57:18.167
We're getting reacquainted.

57:18.169 --> 57:20.736
You know, sometimes
in an event like this,

57:20.738 --> 57:22.237
you leave as better friends.

57:24.074 --> 57:26.775
You and I are not gonna
be better friends after...

57:26.777 --> 57:27.943
(knock on door)

57:27.945 --> 57:28.977
(doorbell ringing)

57:28.979 --> 57:30.112
Are you kidding me?

57:30.114 --> 57:31.547
They're never gonna leave.

57:31.549 --> 57:33.348
[Rachel] No no no
no no no, please.

57:33.350 --> 57:34.550
Please no, no.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.852
Where's Ben?

57:36.854 --> 57:38.821
You have stated your case.

57:38.823 --> 57:41.323
Alright, I can't push
any harder than I did,

57:41.325 --> 57:43.625
it already felt
very ungentlemanly.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.127
No, you did fine, Bobby.

57:45.129 --> 57:48.063
Ben, Lisa, just just go
back in the kitchen, please.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.365
Jules, what are you doing?

57:51.735 --> 57:54.636
I'm doing what I was doing
before Rachel showed up, okay?

57:54.638 --> 57:56.538
Before all of these
people showed up.

57:57.908 --> 58:01.710
I was trying to get us back,
you and me and it's there.

58:03.147 --> 58:05.214
It's there, okay? I feel it.

58:05.216 --> 58:07.649
I feel it and I know
that you feel it.

58:07.651 --> 58:10.786
And yes, we fought all the time

58:10.788 --> 58:12.888
but that's because there
was passion, right?

58:12.890 --> 58:15.057
It was that intense
because it was real.

58:16.494 --> 58:18.060
Don't you feel like
that's missing?

58:18.062 --> 58:20.095
Ben, you are
hurting people, okay?

58:20.097 --> 58:21.029
She goes now.

58:21.031 --> 58:23.098
Part of me does miss it, Rachel.

58:23.100 --> 58:27.236
Not this, this in particular
is terrible but she's not...

58:27.238 --> 58:28.804
Stop it, Ben.

58:28.806 --> 58:31.840
Look, Jules and I used
to scream at each other.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.243
Look, I know that that's
not good or healthy

58:34.245 --> 58:35.611
and I do not want
to go back to that...

58:35.613 --> 58:36.613
Ben.

58:37.715 --> 58:40.449
Just thinking, I'm
not saying anything.

58:40.451 --> 58:45.120
Just put it on pause, you
need time to think, right?

58:45.122 --> 58:46.588
I don't know.

58:46.590 --> 58:49.958
Well Jules is not
saying don't marry Lisa,

58:49.960 --> 58:53.128
she's saying don't
marry Lisa tomorrow.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.963
Just take some time.

58:56.767 --> 59:00.636
Okay, okay, okay, uh, uh Ben,

59:00.638 --> 59:02.938
remember Lisa makes
more than you do

59:02.940 --> 59:05.841
and I'm pretty sure her
father will never like you,

59:05.843 --> 59:08.777
and you said you
could never be sure

59:08.779 --> 59:11.246
you could really be sure that
anyone wouldn't cheat on you.

59:11.248 --> 59:12.147
Even Lisa.

59:12.149 --> 59:13.682
What are you doing?

59:13.684 --> 59:16.685
I'm reminding Ben that Lisa
has some really bad things

59:16.687 --> 59:20.923
about her too 'cause that's
the appeal of Jules, isn't it?

59:20.925 --> 59:23.625
That's she's like, she's
flawed and she's exciting and...

59:23.627 --> 59:24.826
So what, Rachel?

59:24.828 --> 59:26.995
You think tomorrow
should just be like...

59:26.997 --> 59:28.230
No.

59:28.232 --> 59:30.632
Then why are you
saying those things?

59:30.634 --> 59:34.903
I'm doing the bad things
make you love people, right?

59:34.905 --> 59:36.738
- The the fights and stuff.
- What?

59:36.740 --> 59:39.641
It's what Ben said,
the, the screaming.

59:39.643 --> 59:40.643
Wha... What?

59:41.879 --> 59:43.845
I can't even breathe.

59:44.715 --> 59:46.315
Where are you going?

59:46.317 --> 59:47.583
I'm gonna sort of hide.

59:47.585 --> 59:50.319
Ben, I said all of
that in a good way.

59:50.321 --> 59:52.955
(somber music)

59:57.328 --> 59:58.328
Ben?

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.729
Ben, you're not saying anything

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:02.397
and it's really
making me nervous.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.667
I'm not calling off a wedding.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:09.071
I'm not saying you
should but it's good

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.973
that you're thinking about it.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:14.042
It's good that it's in
your head as a possibility.

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.510
Is it a possibility?

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:17.413
No.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:23.218
It's fine, if that's
what you want Ben then...

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:24.687
That's that.

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:27.389
Jules, you are so shitty.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.924
Ben, Ben, you gotta
be kidding me.

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:30.158
We're gonna...

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.429
We are gonna have to
apologize to 224 people.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:36.798
No, we're gonna get married.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.900
We'll have to
call Fr. Patrick.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.636
We should start putting
a list together.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:43.672
We'll have to call Fr.
Patrick and let him know

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.741
we won't need the church.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:47.576
Maybe we can stop the flowers,

01:00:47.578 --> 01:00:49.544
maybe the food and the
flowers and everything

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:50.812
could still go to good use,

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.614
maybe we can have
them sent somewhere?

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:55.651
Oh, I'll have to
call the car company.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.589
Caterers,
photographer, the band.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:01.857
Should I get a pad?

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:02.991
Yeah, that would
be great, Bobby.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:03.993
No, Bobby.

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:08.363
Let's just take a minute.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:09.765
We're not doing anything.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.366
I don't think
we have a minute.

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:14.202
We need to de-plan a
wedding pretty quickly.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.340
I can't make you marry me.

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:21.309
Sweetie, you're not
making me do anything.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.848
He's in love with you,
you're in love with her.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.051
An hour ago you were
ready to marry her,

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.852
you're still ready to marry her.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.188
No, you don't understand.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.690
No, I do understand.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:37.526
No, Rachel, I appreciate
what you're trying to do

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:40.696
but I think the best
thing to do right now

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:43.365
is to start making a list.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:45.000
We have a lot of
calls to make tonight

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:46.802
and it's already kind of late.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:48.904
Who cares if it's late?

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.472
Well, I don't want to be rude,

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.941
it's going to be an
awkward call and I hate

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.077
that we have to do
it so late at night.

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:58.013
It's not right to call
after a certain hour.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.414
That is just lovely.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.189
Lisa, do you feel like you're
having a nervous breakdown?

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.623
Um...

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.193
Okay Ben, this is
getting a little too real.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.427
I know.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:13.662
You need to start
taking this seriously.

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:14.830
Do you think I'm not
taking it seriously?

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.298
I can't tell.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.933
Can you tell if you're
having a nervous breakdown?

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:21.536
Does it taste like adrenaline
or chalk or something?

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:24.172
No, adrenaline
tastes like metal.

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:26.308
So do you taste
metal or batteries

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.542
in the back of your throat?

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:29.745
I don't know what
batteries taste like.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:30.912
Would you two please just go?

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.647
Rachel, I don't think
I can diagnose her

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:34.516
without more information.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.485
I think I am fine.

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:37.986
No, you're not fine.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:41.456
No. I'm not fine, I mean
technically I'm not fine

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:46.261
but I can't be upset
right now, okay?

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.196
I'll be upset later.

01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:53.802
Right now I need to do things.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:59.508
Things, I'm on a big moving
thing and I need to stop it.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:02.878
Lisa, I'm sorry.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.913
There it is, good
sign, what else?

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:07.282
I'm sorry and I
love you so much.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.151
Lisa, I understand
if you're pissed

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:11.286
and if you feel like
the love is gone...

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.821
I'm still in love.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:15.891
You can't stop loving
someone in two minutes.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:17.392
Hear that, Ben?

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.627
I just said I was still
in love with her, okay?

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:21.663
Ben, I am going to go.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.064
I have a bunch of calls to make

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:25.433
and I don't really want to
make them in front of everyone.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:26.368
Listen, you shouldn't do that.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.069
Just wait one second, alright?

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:30.939
And if you're gonna do it, you
should just send a mass text.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.107
Lisa...

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.941
Nobody makes
phone calls anymore.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.509
My Nana sends me texts.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:36.311
No, it's really
impersonal of a message.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.413
It would be a very weird text.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:40.415
I know, I'm just
worried that making

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.517
all those phone calls
is gonna be so painful.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.085
Yeah, it'll be painful.

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.021
I don't want to
see you so sad.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:48.657
Okay, Ben I'm gonna
go for real now.

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:53.562
I'll take care of everything.

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:54.796
I don't want to
call anything off,

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:56.264
let's just talk
all this through.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:57.899
[Maria] You don't want to
call off the wedding anymore?

01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:59.701
I never said
anything like that.

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.905
The only thing I've done
wrong here is think out loud.

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:05.574
You don't think out loud
in a room full of people.

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:06.808
Don't do it.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.343
Yeah, especially not
in a critical situation.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.177
This is a critical situation.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.612
I understand, Bobby.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.180
Good.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.282
You know, I didn't
invite everyone over.

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:17.452
What's done is done, I
can't unthink out loud,

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.921
what I've already
thought out loud.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.890
Sorry everyone, I just
sort of was planning

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:24.626
on having a glass of
scotch tonight and relaxing

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.695
and thinking about things.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.029
And now, I don't know.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.332
I don't know, I'm just
trying to figure out

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.800
what the hell is going on.

01:04:31.802 --> 01:04:33.768
It's not rocket science, Ben.

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.103
It kind of is, Rachel.

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.005
To me it kind of is.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.840
Hey Rach, let's get a
bunch of people in a room

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:40.575
and have them debate what
the best way to move forward

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.177
with the rest of your life is.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.411
You're not mad at me,
you're mad at, Jules.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:44.613
No, I'm not.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.047
You're maybe a
little mad at Jules.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.883
I'm not, it's not her fault.

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:49.117
It is.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.952
Right, actually all
of it is her fault.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:52.587
You're not wrong.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:53.755
But it's just like life, okay?

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:57.592
Sometimes it's
messy, and you know,

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.428
we should be on the same
side of this Rachel.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.665
And the idea of
choosing, it's insane.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:08.403
You either get married
tomorrow or you don't.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.871
No matter what tomorrow comes,

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:11.806
you can't think
your way out of it.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:15.377
I'm not thinking,
I don't need to think.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.249
Jules, I'm in love with Lisa.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.085
I am, and she's great.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:27.389
She really is and
I really am not.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.693
I don't know what's wrong with
both of you that you're here,

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.161
I don't know.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.197
I have no idea, but
I'm in love with her

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.899
and I'm gonna
marry her tomorrow.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:41.970
Tell me you don't
think about me.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.073
I don't.

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.209
Okay.

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.213
Okay.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:55.650
I'm happy for you.

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:57.752

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:28.249
that it happened.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.751
I'm sorry if it looks
like I equivocated.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.486
It looked like
you equivocated.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.955
Okay, and I'm sorry if it did.

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:36.024
Are you saying you didn't?

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:39.461
Yes? I don't really know
what equivocate means.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:41.997
It's what you've been doing
for the past hour or so.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:43.531
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.500
It's not about Jules
and it's not about you,

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.803
it's tensions and
selective memory.

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:51.006
No matter how great the
thing you have now is,

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:54.342
sometimes you just think about
like where life could go.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.311
[Lisa] I don't.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:02.283
Okay, okay, well then you're
a better person than me.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:03.952
There's no doubt about that,

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:07.889
but I'm not, I can't
be excused for this.

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:11.459
I understand that but I'm just
trying to explain the reason.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.729
Like imagine if one of your
exes showed up unannounced.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.831
It'd be weird and it'd
be hard to deal with,

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.400
and you might panic
a little bit, okay?

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:20.068
I'm not trying to
convince you I was right,

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.404
I'm just trying to apologize.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:24.472
You're apologizing?

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:26.674
Yes, I'm so sorry.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.045
For what?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:33.848
For all of this, I
mean for the stress.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.350
Isn't that Jules's fault?

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:37.453
Yes.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.890
So you don't have
anything to apologize for?

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:45.093
No, that doesn't sound right.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:46.095
No?

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.831
No, I thought
this was going well.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.700
How do I mess up an
apology this quickly?

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:53.802
- Bobby?
- I don't know.

01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:55.303
He can't help you.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:56.604
What's my fault, it's...

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.273
What am I apologizing for?

01:07:58.275 --> 01:07:59.908
- It's the equivocating, right?
- Right.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:03.278
I understand how that, and
I know that there's not like

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.048
an excuse or I can't make that
up to you but what I can do,

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.983
what I can do is
I can promise you

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:10.185
that it won't happen again.

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:13.655
You promise what,
that your ex-girlfriend

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.190
won't burst through
the door on the night

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.292
before our wedding ever again?

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.661
Yeah, I can
absolutely promise that.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:23.665
- Oh Jesus that's unlucky man.
- What the hell.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.368
- You're lying.
- What?

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:31.738
You were doing that thing
that you do when you lie.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.642
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.712
Stop, you're really just
gonna stand there and lie to me?

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:40.348
Just lie to my
face, to her face?

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.549
Why can't you just admit it?

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:43.751
Why can't you just admit
what you're feeling?

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.620
Because there's all
these people here.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.755
You haven't caused
enough trouble for me?

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.826
Talk to me.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:52.961
Don't do it.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:56.464
No, fine.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.237
Jules, I was happy
to see you, I was.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.939
I was nervous about
tomorrow and you came in

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:07.308
and it made me feel good.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.178
I remembered about
all these great things

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.013
we used to do together and,

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:16.417
then I realized that that's
not how it was, right?

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:18.720
That's not how it was.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.122
Well, I shouldn't
have left you.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.327
I shouldn't have
left you like that.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.596
Yeah, maybe.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.166
I honestly don't
remember the bad stuff

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.634
with that much clarity.

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:35.036
I sort of remember it but I
mostly remember the good stuff.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.437
Me too.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.604
But it's not right.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.308
Because it wasn't all good.

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:42.944
So I'm remembering it wrong.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.113
You can keep coming in and out

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:48.015
but that's not gonna
change anything.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:49.450
I've had time to
think about all of it

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.486
and I have my bearings.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:53.555
And I'm gonna marry
Lisa tomorrow.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:54.989
You're going to what?

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.324
[Ben] I'm gonna marry you.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:57.258
Are you?

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.159
[Ben] Yeah.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:09:59.161
You sure?

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:02.564
Lisa, I've never been more
sure about anything in my life.

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:03.731
I know this has been a whole lot

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.833
but I don't have any doubts.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.535
That's good, Ben.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.772
That's really good that
you don't have any doubts.

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:14.242
It's good that you've been
able to work through everything

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.911
and eventually come
around to the position

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:19.647
that you don't have any doubts.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:21.716
Sweetie, I'm sorry I
put you through this.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.351
I know it's selfish and I...

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.053
[Lisa] No, I'm happy for you.

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:28.623
You were able to go on this
little trip down memory lane

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:32.860
and realize that marrying me

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.829
wouldn't have been
a huge mistake.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.531
(somber music)

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.733
You, just, just wait.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.568
No, I'm not gonna wait.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:44.205
I have doubts, okay?

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:50.445
Now <i> I</i> have doubts and
I'm not gonna work

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.313
through them tonight because,

01:10:53.183 --> 01:10:55.250
I don't really want to.

01:10:57.621 --> 01:10:59.320
No no no, that's not...

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:00.154
Lisa, you gotta
give me a minute.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:01.289
What are we gonna do?

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.457
We're gonna get married now?

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:03.458
Yes.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.460
Ben.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:07.829
Are you joking? That's not...

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:10.431
Come on, Ben.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:13.201
Come... what?

01:11:13.203 --> 01:11:14.836
Lisa, you gotta
give me a second.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.704
Ben, I'm not gonna wait. I -

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.008
What would I be waiting for?

01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:24.812
It would have been great
to get married to you,

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:29.017
to be married to you and

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:33.888
I think we would have been
really good to each other but,

01:11:35.358 --> 01:11:37.091
I can't marry you now.

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:40.461
You're not sure.

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:45.366
I think you're just
reading this wrong.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:47.468
You gotta give me time
to manage it properly.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.171
No no, don't do that.

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:51.706
Can you just let me...

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.708
No.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:58.346
I'm going to leave and stop.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:02.851
You guys.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.155
No Rachel, that's it.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:09.190
Okay.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.896
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of my side?

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:16.999
Mm-mm.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:20.769
[Ben] Lisa.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.339
[Ben] Lisa?

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.808
It was nice to meet you, Lisa.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.143
We've met a few times, Maria.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.311
Well, good seeing you again.

01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:31.479
You look really great.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:00.842
I'm fine, everything's okay.

01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:02.710
Everybody, everything,
everything's okay.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.612
I feel like I did a
lot of work to get here

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.481
and now it doesn't
feel so great.

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:10.219
Ben.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:12.554
Just go.

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:18.527
How we doing?

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.162
You wanna open some
presents or something?

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:22.497
No, he doesn't want
to open any presents.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:23.831
Why don't you just
get out of here?

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.867
She's joking.

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.668
We can't do jokes
right now, Jules.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.304
I can't do them.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.374
I just...

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.376
(Ben exhales)

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:37.245
Yeah, I can't help you.

01:13:39.816 --> 01:13:40.816
I know.

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:48.256
Oh, I gotta call
everyone I'm closest to

01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:49.323
and disappoint them.

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:52.360
That's the rest of my night.

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.931
Rachel, Bobby, can you
guys get me some, um...

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.132
Get drunk equipment?

01:13:58.134 --> 01:13:58.966
Yeah.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:13:59.801
Okay.

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:01.736
Yeah, on it. Yeah.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.417
I'm...

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:18.519
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.889
Jules, I just lost my fiancee.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.429
(Jules exhales)

01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:36.971
(door closes)

01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:41.142
(sighs)

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:44.145
(fire crackling)

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:52.587
Okay, out of all the bad
things in your life, Ben,

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:54.422
none of them are
gonna be this big.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.596
You're probably gonna
want to grow beard.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.201
Ben, Ben?

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:10.671
Did he stop breathing?

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:11.673
He'll start.

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:14.141
He always does.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:15.343
I'm right here, guys.

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:18.046
I'm okay.

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:19.781
Come on, man.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:24.352
You'll push through this.

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.307
Just let it out.

01:15:29.308 --> 01:15:30.624
Everything that is or
ever will be is gonna die

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:32.426
and it's never coming back.

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:34.328
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:39.534
I appreciate it
but you don't have

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:40.601
to stick around, you know?

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:45.373
I think I prefer to just
die alone in a corner.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:49.443
If I'm being honest,
this was really unexpected.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:54.949
I know it didn't go well but
it was a difficult situation,

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.817
I mean what else
could I have done?

01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:58.419
Oh, now you ask?

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.720
There's no good way out of it.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.756
I mean not if I was
gonna be honest.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.324
There were better ways.

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:05.426
I hope there wasn't
only better ways,

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:07.061
I thought I sort of middled it.

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:18.706
Oh.

01:16:26.316 --> 01:16:28.082
You want to start
calling people?

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.552
Oh, Ben, I wouldn't.

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:42.063
(sighs)
(sniffs)

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:47.902
(hopeful guitar music)

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:04.619
Okay, this is not over, okay?

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.454
I can fix this.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:07.822
Right, what's happened happened

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:09.423
but we can figure it out, right?

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:11.025
Let's figure it out.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.160
This is who I want
in the clutch, okay?

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.762
You guys are my team, right?

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:15.764
Dream team.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.566
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:19.634
Do what?

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.535
You wanna go to Lisa's hotel?

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:24.438
Yes, we go there
and we do something.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.940
Yeah.

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:27.541
We'll go to Lisa's hotel
and I'll do the thing,

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:28.743
the game changing thing.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.077
Redemption.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:31.979
Yeah, let's do
this, Ben. Let's go.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.414
Do you think they're
gonna let us in?

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.050
(guitar and piano
music swells)

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.921
What happened?

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:44.325
It won't matter,
will it? (scoffs)

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.161
No, don't say that.

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:50.131
No, going to her hotel
won't change anything.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.566
Nothing will change anything.

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:54.201
Look, Ben, we...

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:55.503
No, you know I'm right.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.208
I lost her.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.343
No no, we can still try.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:06.113
No, it's done.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:08.817
I'm done.

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:13.422
Okay.

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:16.624
Okay.

01:18:16.626 --> 01:18:19.794
How long do you think I
can hold off making calls?

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.164
Um... not long.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.498
But maybe a little bit?

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:26.801
Yeah, a little bit.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:32.707
You need me to do anything?

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:36.043
I can make some.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.144
No, I'll handle it.

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:43.084
Can I stay with you until I
sort out a place or something?

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:44.086
Of course.

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:47.688
Thanks.

01:18:53.463 --> 01:18:56.163
We will be right inside
if you need anything.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.250
(sliding door closes)

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:31.732
(ring tone)

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:33.568
Hi dad.

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:37.538
(soft music plays)

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:40.188
(music fades)
