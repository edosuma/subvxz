He's not here right now.
I'm Dr. Craig, chief of surgery.

26:12.097 --> 26:14.032
I broke my leg?
Mm-Hmm.

26:14.099 --> 26:16.968
You were just a baby.
You wouldn't remember.

26:17.035 --> 26:22.040
You just kept going higher
and higher and higher,
and then splat.

26:22.107 --> 26:24.409
I broke my leg?
Which one?

26:24.476 --> 26:30.048
The good one.
Oh, he was in a cast
for weeks.

26:30.115 --> 26:32.417
Fiscus.
What are you guys
doing in here?

26:32.484 --> 26:34.419
Peter White, M.D.,
I'd like you to meet
my Aunt Sirca.

26:34.486 --> 26:37.922
How you doing?
Oh, you're adorable.

26:37.989 --> 26:41.693
Just like my woolly
english Sheepdog.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.329
Thank you very much.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.965
Now, uh, smile.

26:48.433 --> 26:50.735
Tell me.

26:50.802 --> 26:53.772
Is an incredible hunk
like you married?

26:53.838 --> 26:55.940
Wrong question,
Aunt sirca.
Oh.

26:56.007 --> 26:58.743
My wife and I are separated.
Not divorced?

26:58.810 --> 27:02.881
No.
Oh, well,
there's hope then.

27:02.947 --> 27:05.283
I left my husband Once.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.052
He was cheating on me
with Agnes nazinski.

27:08.119 --> 27:13.091
But I came back.
Well, what else
could I do?

27:13.158 --> 27:16.294
Now don't you worry, hunk.

27:16.361 --> 27:19.264
Everything will be
all right.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.333
And if it isn't,
well, in a hundred years,

27:22.400 --> 27:25.236
you'll just be worm meat.

27:25.303 --> 27:29.040
Uh, good-Bye, Peter.
Aunt sirca, let me
show you the ward.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.376
I'm gonna take a look
into your eyes now.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.012
You see everything
like accidents--

27:34.078 --> 27:36.314
Well, look.
What is this?

27:36.381 --> 27:39.884
Oh, uh, Phillip Chandler,
this is my Aunt Sirca.

27:39.951 --> 27:43.755
Hello.
Hello there.
What's going on here?

27:43.822 --> 27:47.025
Her uncle picked her up and
accidentally dropped her
on her head.

27:47.091 --> 27:51.930
Oh. Oh, well,
may I?

27:51.996 --> 27:54.332
Sure.
Do hold this.

27:54.399 --> 27:57.769
Hello, my beautiful one.

27:57.836 --> 27:59.838
I know it hurts, Darling.

27:59.904 --> 28:03.842
But I'm going to sing you
a little lullaby
that I used to sing...

28:03.908 --> 28:08.446
<i>to my nephew Wayne here
when he was hurting.</i>

28:08.513 --> 28:14.018
â™ª In olden days, a glimpse
of Stockin' was looked on
as something shockin' â™ª

28:14.085 --> 28:18.490
â™ª now, heaven knows
Anything goes â™ª

28:18.556 --> 28:22.360
â™ª Good WRITERS too
who Once used better words â™ª

28:22.427 --> 28:25.196
<i>â™ª now only use
  four-Letter words â™ª</i>

28:25.263 --> 28:30.201
â™ª writing prose
Oh, anything goes â™ªâ™ª

28:31.736 --> 28:34.038
there now.
You feel better?

28:34.105 --> 28:38.476
I got eight kids already.
We'll have one more.
What's the big deal?

28:38.543 --> 28:41.513
All my life, all I ever
been is pregnant.
Okay, then.

28:41.579 --> 28:43.882
Soon as this one's born,
we'll get you fixed.
No!

28:43.948 --> 28:46.951
You promised you were
gonna get yourself fixed.
It didn't take!

28:47.018 --> 28:49.220
I can't control nature.
It's not my fault!

28:49.287 --> 28:53.124
How do they let a doctor go
doin' an operation when he
doesn't know what he's doin'?

28:53.191 --> 28:56.461
nature works in funny ways,
Barbara.

28:56.528 --> 28:59.030
I can't live
with Nature bein' funny.

28:59.097 --> 29:01.699
And I'm not gonna let
finan go around
screwin' up other people!

29:01.766 --> 29:05.403
Listen to me. When you
were wearing your diaphragm,
you still got pregnant with Jay.

29:05.470 --> 29:08.139
You didn't go after the guy
who made the diaphragm.
That's different!

29:08.206 --> 29:11.342
How is it different?
You got an operation.
That's supposed to work.

29:11.409 --> 29:14.579
When you get an operation,
the doctor takes
your appendix out,

29:14.646 --> 29:16.881
it's supposed to be out
so it doesn't attack you again.

29:16.948 --> 29:20.318
We've been around
the corner on this thing
for six months.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.320
You're startin'
to tick me off.

29:22.387 --> 29:26.491
<i>I had to punch out
at work to come here
and straighten you out.</i>

29:26.558 --> 29:28.560
<i>I'm fed up!
So, take a walk.</i>

29:28.626 --> 29:30.562
I'm goin'.
I'm gettin' outta here.

29:30.628 --> 29:33.131
You're spoiled, Barbara.
You're spoiled rotten.

29:33.198 --> 29:38.336
And you are loony tunes
and you are also crazy
in your "Banero"!

29:41.172 --> 29:45.877
running 3-0 dexon
for the Fascia.

29:45.944 --> 29:48.713
Dr. Craig?
Huh?

29:48.780 --> 29:52.617
Running 3-0 dexon
for the fascia.

29:52.684 --> 29:56.187
Forget it!
I've had it with her!
All right, yusef.

29:56.254 --> 29:58.923
Just a second.
You can't leave her
in there.

29:58.990 --> 30:01.793
She's gone over
the deep end!
We're taking over.

30:01.860 --> 30:04.662
Just a second!
Now, come on.

30:04.729 --> 30:07.966
Let's talk. Come on.

30:08.032 --> 30:12.370
The Board's already grumbling
about the proposed budget.

30:12.437 --> 30:15.440
I don't see how
we're going to convince them
to give us additional funds.

30:15.507 --> 30:17.609
We need more nurses,
Daniel.

30:17.675 --> 30:20.945
We are averaging one nurse
for every 12 beds.

30:21.012 --> 30:22.947
And the night shift
is Worse.

30:23.014 --> 30:25.850
Is there a copy
of those statistics?
Right here.

30:25.917 --> 30:28.720
We've gotta
do something about it
before we're reaccredited.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.789
Thanks.
I'll look 'em over tonight.

30:30.855 --> 30:33.725
How does it feel
to be back at full throttle?
Wonderful.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.094
The last few weeks, I was
really chomping at the bit.

30:36.161 --> 30:40.565
No matter how anxious you are,
you must take time to adjust.
Ease back into it.

30:40.632 --> 30:43.601
Can't afford to.
Too much was left undone
while I was gone.

30:43.668 --> 30:46.938
I'm serious.
Don't push yourself.
I'm cured, Daniel.

30:47.005 --> 30:50.074
They got all the cancer.
That's why I did this.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.044
That's why I chose
to have a mastectomy
over a lumpectomy.

30:53.111 --> 30:56.714
I couldn't see myself running
down for radiation therapy
every day for five weeks...

30:56.781 --> 30:59.150
or taking out more time
for more surgery.

30:59.217 --> 31:01.820
It's over and done with.
I hope that's True.

31:01.886 --> 31:03.822
I know it's True.

31:03.888 --> 31:06.424
Have you been back
to the breast clinic
for any follow-ups?

31:06.491 --> 31:08.760
No. They wanted me
to go for some
counseling sessions.

31:08.827 --> 31:12.063
I went to one, but it didn't
seem to help. I seem to be
handling this well myself.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.199
I should say you are.

31:14.265 --> 31:16.668
When I first got sick,

31:16.734 --> 31:19.304
I didn't like the idea
of people around here
knowing about it.

31:19.370 --> 31:22.607
I felt they would try
to treat me differently--

31:22.674 --> 31:24.843
Kindly.

31:24.909 --> 31:29.547
Daniel, can I
ask you something?
Yeah.

31:29.614 --> 31:35.286
Would it help if I
went before the board
to ask for more nurses?

31:35.353 --> 31:37.288
I don't know.
It might.

31:37.355 --> 31:41.960
I'd be happy to,
if you think it would help.
I'll see you later.

31:46.564 --> 31:51.136
That's really good
scotch, Dr. Westphall.
Thanks.

31:51.202 --> 31:56.741
Bob, can you think of Anyone--
anyone at all who might be able
to talk some sense to your wife?

31:56.808 --> 31:59.511
I mean, family,
her mother?

31:59.577 --> 32:01.446
You kidding?

32:01.513 --> 32:05.083
Well, what about a priest,
a friend, anyone?

32:05.150 --> 32:08.520
Once she gets like this,
forget it. You--

32:08.586 --> 32:11.890
Sure.

32:11.956 --> 32:15.393
Well, it's not just
your wife I'm concerned about.
It's that baby.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.530
Oh, yeah. The baby.

32:18.596 --> 32:21.800
How long you been married?

32:21.866 --> 32:24.469
Twelve years.

32:24.536 --> 32:26.638
<i>And you have eight kids?</i>

32:26.704 --> 32:30.742
Eight kids, two miscarriages.
That's 10. This one makes 11.

32:30.809 --> 32:33.678
When did Dr. Finan
do the vasectomy?

32:33.745 --> 32:36.181
Huh?

32:38.650 --> 32:41.085
When did you have
the vasectomy?

32:41.152 --> 32:43.188
Oh, the vasectomy, it did--

32:43.254 --> 32:46.458
to tell you the truth,
I never had it.

32:46.524 --> 32:48.259
what?

32:49.828 --> 32:51.930
I couldn't go
through with it.

32:51.996 --> 32:55.266
And you told your wife
you did.

32:55.333 --> 32:59.204
Sure. She was so insistent,
but when push came to shove,
I just couldn't do it.

32:59.270 --> 33:02.574
Bob, she's in that operating
room Scaring the hell
out of people...

33:02.640 --> 33:05.410
because she thinks a doctor
fouled up your vasectomy.

33:05.477 --> 33:09.080
I know. I know that.
I feel terrible about it.

33:09.147 --> 33:13.051
- You're gonna have
to tell her the truth.
- I can't! She'll kill me.

33:13.118 --> 33:16.721
Bob, you're gonna
have to tell her.

33:16.788 --> 33:18.690
[ sighs ]

33:20.258 --> 33:23.728
<i>Smile.
[ chuckles ]</i>

33:23.795 --> 33:28.299
Oh. Everybody's
so nice here.

33:28.366 --> 33:31.770
When I break my hip,
I'm coming to st. Eligius.

33:31.836 --> 33:33.838
<i>[ Pager beeping ]
what's that noise?</i>

33:33.905 --> 33:36.007
My beeper.
It means he's got a call.

33:36.074 --> 33:40.845
<i>- Oh. Let me see it.
- I'll be right back.</i>

33:40.912 --> 33:43.648
Wayne told us you
and your husband escaped
from lithuania...

33:43.715 --> 33:45.717
when the communists
overran the country.

33:45.784 --> 33:49.220
About how you had to hide
in the trunk of a car.

33:49.287 --> 33:52.724
My dear ones, what
good's the past, huh?

33:52.791 --> 33:57.295
Why, I can't even remember
my Husband's face.
But who cares?

33:57.362 --> 34:00.765
I was happy then
and I'm happy now.

34:00.832 --> 34:04.135
Oh, here comes
my handsome boy.

34:04.202 --> 34:09.107
<i>You know, I never did
get a snapshot of the two
of you together.</i>

34:09.174 --> 34:12.310
In a minute. Shirley,
can I see you over
by the condiments?

34:12.377 --> 34:16.614
Sure.

34:16.681 --> 34:21.085
There's so much for you
to learn, Dr. Cavanero.

34:21.152 --> 34:25.690
I don't see how
you can hold it all in
that pretty head of yours.

34:25.757 --> 34:29.360
What's the matter?
I just got off the
phone with my mother.

34:29.427 --> 34:31.830
So?
She just got off the phone
with Aunt Sirca.

34:31.896 --> 34:34.099
When did Aunt Sirca
make a call?

34:34.165 --> 34:36.668
Aunt Sirca's wondering
why I never showed up.

34:36.734 --> 34:40.237
Wait. I'm not
following this.
That makes two of us.

34:40.304 --> 34:43.041
So?
So, that woman
is not my Aunt.

34:43.108 --> 34:45.577
What are you talking about?
She is not my Aunt.

34:45.643 --> 34:48.913
You're kidding. Then who is she?

34:48.980 --> 34:50.882
That's a good question.

34:57.489 --> 35:02.093
<i>No, Jimmy.
No, I cannot give you a break.
[ door opens, closes ]</i>

35:02.160 --> 35:06.064
because a break to you
isn't 10 or 15 minutes.

35:06.131 --> 35:08.166
No. Now listen to me,
Jimmy.

35:08.233 --> 35:12.203
Unless you are back in
this house by 8:00, There'll
be hell to pay, got it?

35:12.270 --> 35:15.673
Right. Have a good time.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.610
Bye-Bye. Well.

35:18.676 --> 35:21.212
Hi. He's dining out
with friends tonight.

35:21.279 --> 35:23.248
What are you doing
home so early?

35:23.314 --> 35:25.917
I was investigating
some claims in Medford,

35:25.984 --> 35:28.153
and I didn't wanna
fight the traffic
back into the city.

35:28.219 --> 35:31.556
So, I stopped off
on the way home
and bought you a present.

35:35.527 --> 35:37.495
Open it.

35:39.264 --> 35:42.834
[ gasps ]
Oh, it's beautiful.

35:42.901 --> 35:45.470
They had a gorgeous
one in beige--
no, this is lovely.

35:45.537 --> 35:47.972
Well, put it on.

35:48.039 --> 35:50.875
I will.

35:50.942 --> 35:53.344
No, put it on now.
Later.

35:57.515 --> 36:00.118
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

36:00.185 --> 36:03.555
You didn't.
It's just a reflex.

36:06.191 --> 36:08.860
Don't I get a thank-You kiss?

36:10.962 --> 36:14.933
That wasn't so bad now,
was it?
What do you mean?

36:14.999 --> 36:17.435
Ira, it's the middle
of the afternoon.

36:17.502 --> 36:20.839
What's that got
to do with it?
Ira, don't.

36:20.905 --> 36:24.609
What's the matter?
The kids might come home.

36:24.676 --> 36:27.712
It's not the kids,
it's not the hour.

36:27.779 --> 36:30.648
It's the mastectomy, and I don't
care about your operation.
Don't you?

36:30.715 --> 36:32.684
No!

36:34.085 --> 36:37.689
You want to see it?
Do you?

36:37.755 --> 36:39.724
Yes.

36:43.361 --> 36:45.330
No, you don't.

36:58.943 --> 37:01.012
<i>[ Fiscus ]
how could you?</i>

37:01.079 --> 37:04.482
I mean, impersonating an Aunt.
There's gotta be
some law against that.

37:04.549 --> 37:07.585
Don't work yourself
into a sweat.

37:07.652 --> 37:09.988
You'll catch a germ
and Keel Over.

37:10.054 --> 37:12.924
Look, you're
a nice old lady,
but you are driving me crazy.

37:12.991 --> 37:15.994
Wayne, there had
to be a good reason
why she did it.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.830
Are you all alone
in the world?
No family?

37:18.897 --> 37:23.635
I wish. I got tons of family
from here to vilna.

37:23.701 --> 37:26.638
Then why?

37:26.704 --> 37:30.074
Well, when you came
into the room together,

37:30.141 --> 37:32.544
you looked adorable.

37:32.610 --> 37:36.848
So, what's the wedding date?
That's it. Up and out.
We're taking you back to malden.

37:36.915 --> 37:38.883
Don't bother.
I'll take a bus.

37:38.950 --> 37:43.855
I'm angry, but not enough
to let a 73-year-Old impostor
schlep home to the home.

37:43.922 --> 37:46.157
We're gonna give you a ride.
Forget it.

37:46.224 --> 37:50.161
Besides, I didn't like the way
you drove coming over here.

37:50.228 --> 37:54.966
This is amazing.
I can tell
when I'm not wanted.

37:55.033 --> 37:58.436
But I don't regret
my little charade at all.

37:58.503 --> 38:01.739
I had fun. And I got
some great pictures.

38:01.806 --> 38:04.175
Now one more,

38:04.242 --> 38:07.545
This is absolutely amazing.
We'd love to.

38:08.746 --> 38:10.648
Smile.

38:12.217 --> 38:15.587
Say onomatopoeia.
Onomatopoeia.

38:18.356 --> 38:22.861
I'll say hello
to your aunt sirca for you.

38:22.927 --> 38:26.097
But to tell the truth,
she never liked you.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.202
I'm glad my Uncle futzo
isn't alive.
This would've killed him.

38:31.269 --> 38:34.005
Wayne, relax.
I know,
but it's just not fair.

38:34.072 --> 38:37.175
I finally get
a solid day off, we plan
to spend it together,

38:37.242 --> 38:41.379
and we end up here
at st. Eligius taking care
of Some first-Rate crackpot.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.381
And we're not
even being paid for it.

38:43.448 --> 38:47.118
We still have
five hours left.
Let's get out of here.

38:47.185 --> 38:50.989
I screwed up our day. It's up
to you to screw up our evening.
Oh.

38:51.055 --> 38:55.059
We could go to my new place,
but I don't think you'd enjoy
sitting on an orange crate.

38:55.126 --> 39:00.465
What do you say we head
over to my house, lie back
and catch the 4:30 movie?

39:00.532 --> 39:03.268
But you don't own a tv.
Mm-Hmm.

39:15.246 --> 39:18.883
What do you want?

39:18.950 --> 39:23.188
Dr. Finan is in Mexico,
sweetheart. They can't
reach him for a week.

39:23.254 --> 39:25.089
So?

39:25.156 --> 39:27.992
You gonna stay here
all week?
A year, if I have to.

39:28.059 --> 39:30.161
Bob.

39:30.228 --> 39:32.163
Listen, sweetheart.

39:32.230 --> 39:35.600
<i>It's not finan's fault.
Oh, that's a good one.</i>

39:35.667 --> 39:37.836
I never got
the damn vasectomy.

39:40.405 --> 39:43.174
[ Ehrlich ]
Oh, boy.
What?

39:43.241 --> 39:46.344
- I never got it!
- You're gonna get it.

39:46.411 --> 39:48.346
<i>Don't, Barbara.
You're gonna get it!</i>

39:48.413 --> 39:51.349
Please, Barbara, don't.
You sniveling coward.

39:51.416 --> 39:54.319
You pathetic lowlife!

39:54.385 --> 39:58.523
- Mark, come on.
- No, no, no! Do you know
what he's put her through?

39:58.590 --> 40:03.261
He claims afoul on Dr. Finan,
and then he puts this whole
operation in jeopardy!

40:03.328 --> 40:05.697
You've got a hell
of a nerve, Buddy boy!

40:05.764 --> 40:08.399
You're gonna get it!
You're gonna get it!

40:08.466 --> 40:10.969
If a vasectomy is what
you want, Mrs. Loniker,

40:11.035 --> 40:13.705
a vasectomy is what
he's gonna get!

40:13.772 --> 40:15.940
You got any problems
with that, loniker?

40:17.275 --> 40:19.210
You better do it right.

40:19.277 --> 40:22.347
Lady, that's
the only way I do it!

40:28.086 --> 40:31.289
Rhonda, prep O.R. 2, stat.

40:31.356 --> 40:35.427
Dr. Craig, what about
the dressing?
Finish it, Ehrlich!

40:35.493 --> 40:39.664
You're gonna get it!
You're gonna get it!

40:39.731 --> 40:42.534
I met Samantha eggar once,

40:42.600 --> 40:47.272
near sixth Avenue
and 16th street
on a number three bus.

40:56.581 --> 40:59.851
So, you said
you're a nurse?

41:00.885 --> 41:03.755
Uh-Huh.

41:03.822 --> 41:06.324
Want some?
No, thanks.

41:08.693 --> 41:12.764
You waiting for someone?

41:12.831 --> 41:15.500
Nights like this
drive me crazy.

41:15.567 --> 41:18.403
Believe it or not, I like it
better when the bar
is three deep...

41:18.470 --> 41:22.140
and the waitresses yell in
for drinks from the tables.

41:22.207 --> 41:25.944
I know what you mean.
It's the same at the hospital.

41:26.010 --> 41:28.446
Oh, yeah?
Which one?

41:28.513 --> 41:31.149
St. Eligius.
Oh.

41:31.216 --> 41:34.619
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.

41:34.686 --> 41:39.824
It's just that I
have heard things can get
pretty rough around there.

41:39.891 --> 41:41.860
Yeah, it can.

41:43.528 --> 41:47.332
It's funny.
What?

41:47.398 --> 41:51.369
You don't strike me
as the kind of person who would
wanna deal with all that.

41:51.436 --> 41:55.573
You seem, kind of--
I don't know-- kind of sad.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.309
Oh. Thank you very much.

42:00.178 --> 42:03.648
I'm sorry. There I go
sticking the old foot
in the mouth again.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.586
I mean, look at you.

42:08.653 --> 42:13.291
You're really doing
something with your life.
You're helping people get well.

42:13.358 --> 42:15.393
And then there's me.

42:15.460 --> 42:20.899
College graduate, Emerson, '82,
and what have I done
for the past 10 months?

42:20.965 --> 42:23.501
I spent the winter skiing
in Stratton, vermont.

42:23.568 --> 42:28.673
Then I came back to Boston
and got a job here
at bullfeathers.

42:28.740 --> 42:30.675
What is it you want to do?

42:30.742 --> 42:34.479
I don't know.
That's the problem.

42:34.546 --> 42:37.215
What's your name?

42:37.282 --> 42:39.684
I'm Scott.
Hi, Scott. I'm Helen.

42:39.751 --> 42:43.721
Hi, Helen.
How 'bout another?

42:43.788 --> 42:45.723
No, no.

42:45.790 --> 42:48.760
Come on.
It's on the House.

42:48.827 --> 42:52.597
No. I should be
getting home.

42:58.103 --> 43:00.638
Hey, why don't
you stick around.

43:00.705 --> 43:05.376
I get off in 15 minutes.
Maybe we could grab a bite
to eat or something.

43:05.443 --> 43:07.378
Okay.

Good evening,
sleeping beauty.

43:27.799 --> 43:30.668
Was I out long?
I just got here.

43:31.870 --> 43:33.838
[ sighs ]

43:35.640 --> 43:38.877
sleeping only made things
worse. I feel more tired
now than before.

43:38.943 --> 43:42.247
So, how'd
the first surgery go?
Pretty routine, huh?

43:42.313 --> 43:44.415
Didn't you hear?

43:44.482 --> 43:48.253
No. Don't tell me.
You froze.

43:48.319 --> 43:52.757
Froze? I had a PSYCHOTIC
pregnant woman with a gun
standing over me the whole time.

43:54.592 --> 43:56.795
Right, Ehrlich, sure.

43:56.861 --> 44:00.365
<i>I'm serious!
Go back to dreamland.</i>

44:00.432 --> 44:02.467
Yeah, maybe I did
dream it all.

44:02.534 --> 44:06.404
- Maybe you should go home.

Yeah.

44:12.510 --> 44:15.480

44:15.547 --> 44:19.617
How 'bout dinner tonight?
I wish I could.

44:19.684 --> 44:22.287
You wanna drive out
to Bedford for this weekend?

44:22.353 --> 44:25.290
Sorry.
I never liked Bedford.

44:25.356 --> 44:28.293
Never went for the town.

44:31.362 --> 44:33.865
Um--

44:33.932 --> 44:36.134
is there something
you want?

44:36.201 --> 44:39.070
Not particularly.
Right.

44:39.137 --> 44:41.172
Um, then--

44:41.239 --> 44:45.076
Right. Night, All.
Yeah.

44:48.379 --> 44:51.249
Hi, mark.
How was your afternoon?

44:51.316 --> 44:54.285
Mmm.

44:54.352 --> 44:57.856
I finally got Mr. Loniker's
brakes realigned.

44:57.922 --> 45:03.194
How'd he take it?
Like your average
pathetic sniveler.

45:03.261 --> 45:05.230
I'm glad to hear
We're pressing charges
on mrs. Loniker.

45:05.296 --> 45:10.034
That woman's a madman.
I just wish we could find
some charge to hang on him.

45:10.101 --> 45:13.204
Do you think she was
really aiming at the stereo?
I think so.

45:13.271 --> 45:17.976
With that stupid music
Ehrlich had on,
who could blame her?

45:18.042 --> 45:20.011
He did a good job today,
Ehrlich.

45:20.078 --> 45:23.114
Yeah. He seemed to
handle himself very Well.

45:23.181 --> 45:25.116
He really measured up
to the situation.

45:25.183 --> 45:28.453
I'm tough on him,
day in, day out.

45:28.520 --> 45:31.623
And God knows
everything about him
grates like sandpaper--

45:31.689 --> 45:35.026

45:35.093 --> 45:37.429
But he really
came through today.

we pulled the plug

Hi.

there was an emergency
down here last night.

I went to a movie and had
a couple of drinks in a bar.

in someone's apartment--

about it. It's all right. I just
don't wanna hear about it.
