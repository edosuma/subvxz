00:17.750 --> 00:19.399
What's with hide-and-go-peek?

00:19.499 --> 00:21.650
PIPER:
He's still staring at me.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.276
Who?

00:22.376 --> 00:23.734
That guy at
the end of the bar.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.399
PHOEBE:
Oh no, honey,
that's not staring,

00:26.499 --> 00:27.399
that's flirting.

00:27.499 --> 00:28.399
You say tomato.

00:28.499 --> 00:30.625
No, I say relax-o.

00:31.499 --> 00:32.442
He seems pretty harmless.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.650
I mean, he's
clean-cut, innocent,

00:33.750 --> 00:36.399
the kind of guy that a girl
could teach a few things to.

00:36.499 --> 00:40.026
Hello, kind of girl who's in
a serious relationship.

00:40.126 --> 00:41.109
Besides, it's always

00:41.209 --> 00:42.399
the innocent-looking ones

00:42.499 --> 00:44.399
you have to watch out for.

00:44.499 --> 00:46.109
Oh.

00:46.209 --> 00:46.734
Hi.

00:46.834 --> 00:50.151
Hey all right, I need some
professional help.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.442
No arguments here.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.400
Ha. Cute.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.775
Where is your deejay?

00:53.875 --> 00:55.399
Uh, he's on break. Why?

00:55.499 --> 00:55.829
What's going on?

00:55.839 --> 00:57.817
You know when you get a song
stuck in your head

00:57.917 --> 00:59.399
and you can't seem
to get it out?

00:59.499 --> 00:59.996
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:00.006 --> 01:01.525
I couldn't get the <i>Facts of Life
</i> theme song

01:01.625 --> 01:02.692
out of my head for like
three years.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.399
All right, well I have
absolutely no idea

01:04.498 --> 01:06.276
what this one is,
and it's driving me crazy.

01:06.376 --> 01:07.775
And I thought that
maybe your deejay

01:07.875 --> 01:09.399
would recognize it or something.

01:09.499 --> 01:10.026
How's it go?

01:10.126 --> 01:12.026
I'm not going
to sing it for you.

01:12.126 --> 01:14.499
Why not?
Maybe we'll recognize it.

01:15.499 --> 01:16.399
Okay

01:16.499 --> 01:18.167
(<i>humming tune</i>)

01:21.376 --> 01:22.525
Anything?

01:22.625 --> 01:23.192
<i>Nada.</i>

01:23.292 --> 01:24.692
I'm thinking if you
tried it again

01:24.792 --> 01:25.942
with a little bit more oomph,

01:26.042 --> 01:27.399
you know, maybe
some choreography

01:27.499 --> 01:28.692
and Piper could
back you up

01:28.792 --> 01:30.276
with some old-school beat box.

01:30.376 --> 01:31.442
Why did I know that I would get

01:31.542 --> 01:33.984
absolutely no help
out of you crazy people?

01:34.084 --> 01:37.399
Oh, come on,
wait a minute.

01:37.499 --> 01:38.483
Wait.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.109
We can't let you leave

01:40.209 --> 01:42.151
completely empty-handed.

01:42.251 --> 01:42.662
What is this?

01:42.672 --> 01:45.067
Well it seems like you
really re-connected

01:45.167 --> 01:45.787
with our old friend Justin.

01:45.797 --> 01:49.567
He's inviting us to his big
annual family barbecue.
Sounds like fun.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.817
For who?

01:50.917 --> 01:52.109
I mean, you know,
Justin and I

01:52.209 --> 01:54.067
are still in the
flirtatious banter stage

01:54.167 --> 01:54.537
of the relationship.

01:54.547 --> 01:58.151
I think hanging out with the
folks might put a damper on it.

01:58.251 --> 01:58.984
Is that all?

01:59.084 --> 02:01.026
Yeah. What do you mean?

02:01.126 --> 02:01.620
I mean are your sure

02:01.630 --> 02:04.318
it's not because
it's a big family gathering?

02:04.418 --> 02:05.037
Okay, if you're going to go with

02:05.047 --> 02:07.734
the 'Prues-got-parental-issues
card, let me save you some time.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.399
PIPER:
Oh Prue, it's not like
we blame you.

02:09.499 --> 02:12.109
I mean, seeing complete
connected families

02:12.209 --> 02:13.151
is hard on all of us.

02:13.251 --> 02:14.650
But we can't spend our lives

02:14.750 --> 02:15.859
avoiding what bothers us.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.067
The only thing
bothering me right now

02:17.167 --> 02:20.318
is that I cannot get this stupid
song out of my head, all right?

02:20.418 --> 02:21.567
So I really appreciate
your concern,

02:21.667 --> 02:23.734
but do you know what I would
appreciate even more?

02:23.834 --> 02:26.151

with chance of showers?

05:39.209 --> 05:41.775
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

05:41.875 --> 05:42.483
Nothing pressing.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.400
You pull
an all-nighter again?

message from?

05:52.667 --> 05:53.399
Oh, it's nothing.

05:53.499 --> 05:55.984
All right, well nothing
usually means something,

05:56.084 --> 05:57.817
and... something
usually means a boy, so...

05:57.917 --> 06:01.399
PIPER:
All right, I don't know
what you guys are talking about,

06:01.499 --> 06:04.399
but what I've got is better,
at least bizarrer.

06:04.499 --> 06:05.276
Bizarrer?
Mm-hmm.

06:05.376 --> 06:06.901
Is that even a word, Piper?

06:07.001 --> 06:07.399
Whatever.

06:07.499 --> 06:09.859
Anyway, Cara called last night
and she had a meeting

06:09.959 --> 06:11.399
in the Bay Tech
building yesterday.

06:11.499 --> 06:13.109
And she swore that
she saw Victor

06:13.209 --> 06:14.692
walking through the lobby.

06:14.792 --> 06:15.399
As in Dad Victor?

06:15.499 --> 06:17.192
As in we haven't spoken to him
in a year

06:17.292 --> 06:19.399
and yeah, he's probably in town
and he hasn't even bothered

06:19.499 --> 06:21.399
to call us,
yes, that would be the one.

06:21.499 --> 06:22.359
Now you see my need to share?

06:22.459 --> 06:24.399
Wait, but Cara hasn't
seen him since what?

06:24.499 --> 06:26.151
Like the first grade, I know.

06:26.251 --> 06:27.483
But she sounded very sure.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.318
Why do you think
he's here?

06:29.418 --> 06:30.984
Should we go
and try and find him?

06:31.084 --> 06:32.399
I mean, what if

06:32.499 --> 06:33.399
it has nothing to do with us?

06:33.499 --> 06:36.399
Well, I for one am not going
to go out of my way to find out.

06:36.499 --> 06:38.399
Wait, you're not even curious?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.276
Come on Prue, I mean,

06:40.376 --> 06:41.483
he is our father.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.318
No, like I've said before,
I've come to terms

06:43.418 --> 06:44.494
with our lack
of parental involvement.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.901
You know, some people just
weren't meant

06:46.001 --> 06:46.954
to have the
Rockwellian portrait--

06:46.964 --> 06:48.609
the house, the two-car garage,
the picket fence,

06:48.709 --> 06:50.984
the golden retriever
and the doting mom and dad.

06:51.084 --> 06:53.399
PIPER:
Okay, so we're not
the typical family.

06:53.499 --> 06:55.399
But he is all we have, Prue.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.984
No, Piper, we have each other.

06:58.084 --> 06:58.662
Okay, and we have

06:58.672 --> 07:00.399
other people that love us too,
and very full

07:00.499 --> 07:03.442
and busy lives-- speaking
of which, I got to dash.

07:03.542 --> 07:04.692
If you want to have lunch,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.734
I'll be up on Nob Hill
in the park.

07:06.834 --> 07:08.442
We're doing a shoot, okay?

07:08.542 --> 07:09.400
Okay.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.525
Okay.

07:10.625 --> 07:11.525
Hey, can I walk you out?

07:11.625 --> 07:14.650

Excuse me...

08:20.499 --> 08:21.775
Hi. I'm...

08:21.875 --> 08:24.399
You don't really care
who I am, do you?

08:24.499 --> 08:26.192
I mean, everybody else is
on lunch break

08:26.292 --> 08:27.734
and you're stuck here fielding
random questions

08:27.834 --> 08:30.359
from people who probably
shouldn't even be asking them

08:30.459 --> 08:31.525
in the first place, because...

08:31.625 --> 08:33.399
Can I actually help you?

08:33.499 --> 08:34.399
Yeah. Right.

08:34.499 --> 08:39.499
Uh, I'd like to know which
company Victor Bennett is with?

08:41.500 --> 08:42.984
He's not.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.399
Excuse me?

08:44.499 --> 08:45.984
Bennett comma Victor,

08:46.084 --> 08:46.775
he's not listed

08:46.875 --> 08:48.399
in any office
in the building.

08:48.499 --> 08:52.650
I uh, have a picture,
it's about from a decade ago,

08:52.750 --> 08:53.650
but have you

08:53.750 --> 08:55.834
seen him around?

08:56.625 --> 08:59.499
Are you sure?
Because I know that...

09:02.209 --> 09:03.499
Dad?!

09:05.334 --> 09:06.859
Dad!

09:06.959 --> 09:07.901
What?

09:08.001 --> 09:08.817
It's.. .

09:08.917 --> 09:11.026
it's not you.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.859
I'm sorry.
I thought you were...

09:12.959 --> 09:15.499
I'm sorry.

09:20.499 --> 09:22.442
PRUE:
So they say stick
to what you know,

09:22.542 --> 09:25.609
so I pitched a piece about
growing up in the city.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.775
Hopefully it'll
make the cover.

09:27.875 --> 09:28.734
You're dodging.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.400
Artfully, but it's
still a dodge.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.399
All right,

09:32.499 --> 09:33.399
did you ever consider that

09:33.499 --> 09:34.483
maybe I just don't want to go?

09:34.583 --> 09:36.901
No, it has nothing
to do with the barbecue

09:37.001 --> 09:39.483
or the guy that asked you
to go with him.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.459
It has to do with Dad.

09:41.959 --> 09:45.026
Why do you insist on pinning
everything that I do

09:45.126 --> 09:47.399
on my feelings or lack
thereof for our father?

09:47.499 --> 09:50.901
Prue, you say you're over it,
but you say it so much

09:51.001 --> 09:51.537
that I have this feeling

09:51.547 --> 09:54.817
that the person you're trying
to convince is yourself.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.399
And believe me,

09:56.499 --> 09:58.400
after what I went
through with Cole,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.399
if anyone
understands that,

10:00.499 --> 10:01.026
it's me.

10:01.126 --> 10:02.525
It's sort of not
the same thing.

10:02.625 --> 10:03.151
Well maybe it is.

10:03.251 --> 10:05.817
My feelings for our
father are in the past,

10:05.917 --> 10:09.775
which means they really have
no place in the present.

10:09.875 --> 10:10.692
So Justin
gets penalized.

10:10.792 --> 10:13.499
(<i>child humming Prue's tune</i>)

10:14.792 --> 10:15.609
There it is.

10:15.709 --> 10:16.775
What?
That song,

10:16.875 --> 10:18.775
don't you hear it?
Somebody's humming it.

(<i>humming tune</i>)

10:27.084 --> 10:28.499
Hi.

10:29.499 --> 10:31.901
Hey, I was wondering if
you could tell me

10:32.001 --> 10:35.251
what that song is that
you're humming?

10:37.001 --> 10:40.834
(<i>ice cream truck
 music playing Prue's tune</i>)

10:43.292 --> 10:44.276
Okay, riddle solved.

10:44.376 --> 10:45.567
Now you can stop humming

10:45.667 --> 10:47.192
that stupid song.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.234
So I think we were
in the middle

10:48.334 --> 10:49.775
of you trying to make
a strong argument

10:49.875 --> 10:51.276
of why you're not
going to go

10:51.376 --> 10:53.459
to Justin's barbecue.

10:54.042 --> 10:55.276
Prue, if you keep
ignoring me,

10:55.376 --> 10:58.167
my feelings just might
actually implode.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.067
It's cold out.

11:04.167 --> 11:06.318
Yeah, there's a little thing
we like to call winter here.

11:06.418 --> 11:10.399
Why would a child want ice cream
when it's this cold out?

11:10.499 --> 11:13.399
And... the truck pulled up
and no one budged.

11:13.499 --> 11:15.318
And did you notice,
there are no parents.

11:15.418 --> 11:17.399
Okay, connect the dots
for me please?

11:17.499 --> 11:18.442
Preferably standing still.

11:18.542 --> 11:21.026
What? Do you have a hankering
for a snow cone?

11:21.126 --> 11:23.109
Prue, we're in the middle
of a conversation,

11:23.209 --> 11:26.650
and considering your lunch hour
ended oh, five minutes ago,

11:26.750 --> 11:28.483
we should probably
make this fast.

11:28.583 --> 11:29.692
Yeah well, something's wrong.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.734
Yeah, I know that.
Why don't you talk
to me about it?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.984
Not with me, Phoebe,
with this all right.

11:35.084 --> 11:36.609
I have a total
dÃ©jÃ  vu coming on.

11:36.709 --> 11:39.234
Okay, so first you're
humming weird songs

11:39.334 --> 11:41.792
and now you're
having flashbacks?

11:44.792 --> 11:45.650
Hello?

11:45.750 --> 11:47.650
MAN:
Want some ice cream,
little one?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.942
My instincts are usually...

11:50.042 --> 11:54.109
(<i>girl screaming</i>)

11:54.209 --> 11:55.625
No! Hold on!

12:03.459 --> 12:06.292
(<i>screaming</i>)

12:15.418 --> 12:18.500
(<i>wind whistling</i>)

12:18.667 --> 12:21.399
Uh... all right,
where's the little girl?

12:21.499 --> 12:23.609
I don't know.
I was holding on
to her and then...

12:23.709 --> 12:24.442
We have to find her.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.692
Well, first we have
to figure out
where the hell we are!

12:26.792 --> 12:27.829
Well, I'm just gonna take
a wild guess

12:27.839 --> 12:29.442
and say that we're not
still in the ice cream truck.

12:29.542 --> 12:34.234
Or even worse,
we are still in
the ice cream truck.

12:34.334 --> 12:36.483
Prue...
(child's voice
 yelling in distance)

12:36.583 --> 12:39.234
I know;
I hear it, too.

12:39.334 --> 12:40.834
(<i>both gasp</i>)

12:41.875 --> 12:43.859
All right, if there's
a way in,

12:43.959 --> 12:45.609
there's definitely
a way out.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.359
Who are you?!
(<i>both scream</i>)

12:47.459 --> 12:48.692
No powers, no powers,
no powers!

12:48.792 --> 12:51.499
I'm not surprised, I'm not
surprised, I'm not surprised!

12:56.251 --> 12:57.499
Uh...

13:01.084 --> 13:04.499
Okay, something tells me
he was not running from us.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.399
Okay, let's go.

13:08.499 --> 13:10.399
CHILD:
Help!

13:10.499 --> 13:12.499
Please, help me!

13:13.625 --> 13:14.734
Help you from what?

13:14.834 --> 13:16.525
The Nothing.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.609
PHOEBE:
Is that the man that
we just saw here?

13:19.709 --> 13:21.151
It's up there.

13:21.251 --> 13:24.400
It comes for you,
for everybody.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.984
And when he gets you,

13:26.084 --> 13:29.067
the only thing left
where you stood is nothing.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.399
You never know
when it's coming.

13:31.499 --> 13:33.442
And you never know
who it wants.

13:33.542 --> 13:37.525
We try to hide
but he keeps finding us.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.442
Hurry!

13:38.542 --> 13:39.984
It's coming!

13:40.084 --> 13:41.026
In here!

13:41.126 --> 13:42.499
Come on!

13:43.499 --> 13:45.583
Here... in here!

13:46.292 --> 13:48.001
GIRL:
Wait for me!

13:49.499 --> 13:50.399
Run!

13:50.499 --> 13:51.399
Help!

13:51.499 --> 13:53.734
She's not gonna make it.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.984
(<i>screaming</i>)

13:55.084 --> 13:56.376
Prue!

13:58.542 --> 14:01.251
Prue, come on!

14:10.418 --> 14:12.399
She was right there.

14:12.499 --> 14:13.234
Prue, it's not your fault.

14:13.334 --> 14:14.901
Our powers don't work here.
We know that now.

14:15.001 --> 14:17.459
We'll be better prepared
next time.

14:18.334 --> 14:20.917
Does that mean
that you're gonna save us?

14:21.834 --> 14:22.399
Us?

14:22.499 --> 14:24.775
There are others just like me,
hiding.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.792
Captured by
the ice cream man.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.151
If he doesn't want you here,

14:31.251 --> 14:35.399
that must mean that you have
the power to save us.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.734
We should go.

14:37.834 --> 14:40.400
The Nothing will be coming back.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.625
He always does. Come on!

14:44.499 --> 14:46.318
<i>Prue, it's me</i>

14:46.418 --> 14:47.399
leaving you another message

14:47.499 --> 14:49.399
after leaving Phoebe
another message.

14:49.499 --> 14:50.109
I tried you at work,

14:50.209 --> 14:52.026
but they said
you never checked in

14:52.126 --> 14:52.942
after your shoot.

14:53.042 --> 14:55.334
So where are you guys?

14:55.917 --> 14:59.525
Uh, look, so call me.
Or better yet,

14:59.625 --> 15:00.399
just show up and save me

15:00.499 --> 15:01.246
from having to perform

15:01.256 --> 15:04.875
an impending awkward rejection
all by myself!

15:05.709 --> 15:08.442
Hi, I'm Caleb.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.359
Piper.

15:09.459 --> 15:13.499
I'm sort of new in town
and I'm looking to meet someone?

15:14.499 --> 15:16.376
Someone special?

15:17.292 --> 15:17.662
Uh, sorry.

15:17.672 --> 15:20.399
I didn't mean to interrupt
your phone call to your...

15:20.499 --> 15:24.901
FiancÃ©. Very large,
very jealous fiancÃ©.

15:25.001 --> 15:28.026
Really? Does-does he ever
come here?

15:28.126 --> 15:29.650
(<i>chuckles</i>):
Yeah, all the time.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.318
So he-he lives nearby?

15:32.418 --> 15:33.109
Uh, look, I'm flattered,

15:33.209 --> 15:36.399
and you know, if this was
another time or place, uh...

15:36.499 --> 15:39.734
Maybe you'd like to meet
one of my single sisters?

15:39.834 --> 15:42.399
You've got sisters? Really?

15:42.499 --> 15:43.734
Well, maybe
we could all

15:43.834 --> 15:44.609
get together some time.

15:44.709 --> 15:49.859
Uh, does, does your fiancÃ© like
to hang out

15:49.959 --> 15:51.583
with your sisters, too?

15:52.499 --> 15:54.359
Okay. Uh, you know what?

15:54.459 --> 15:56.276
I don't know what kind of kinky
stuff you're into,

15:56.376 --> 15:57.399
but there's a club
down the street

15:57.499 --> 15:58.734
you might be more
comfortable in.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.609
They've got cages
and rubber floors,

16:00.709 --> 16:02.984
and a three-for-two special
on Fridays.

16:03.084 --> 16:05.359
I'm not looking for a club,
Piper.

16:05.459 --> 16:06.329
And I'm not interested, Caleb.

16:06.339 --> 16:08.984
At least, not in what I think
you're interested in.

16:09.084 --> 16:10.192
So if you don't mind,

16:10.292 --> 16:12.901
I have lots of stacking
and stuff to do.

16:13.001 --> 16:15.234
I think you got
the wrong... Oh, okay.

16:15.334 --> 16:15.537
I...

16:15.547 --> 16:20.542
I'm gonna come back later when,
when you're not stacking.

16:26.499 --> 16:29.499
Prue, where are you guys?

16:30.042 --> 16:31.399
Are we going in circles?

16:31.499 --> 16:34.775
This looks like
the exact same playground.

16:34.875 --> 16:35.399
In this place,

16:35.499 --> 16:37.192
everywhere you go
looks the same.

16:37.292 --> 16:38.609
That's how the Nothing gets you.

16:38.709 --> 16:42.292
Only a few of us can find
our way.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.318
Why couldn't you get
a boy band song in your head

16:46.418 --> 16:46.912
like everybody else?

16:46.922 --> 16:50.525
All right, just tell us
everything that you know

16:50.625 --> 16:52.400
about the mean ice cream man.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.775
Just that he's the one
who put us here.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.609
All right, so is he

16:56.709 --> 16:59.399
in charge of the Nothing?

16:59.499 --> 17:01.775
I don't know, I-I guess.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.108
The others are gonna be so happy
to see you.

17:04.209 --> 17:06.525
We've been wishing and hoping
that someday,

17:06.625 --> 17:10.959
someone would come and save us.
And now you're here!

17:11.126 --> 17:12.567
Well, we're gonna do
whatever we can

17:12.666 --> 17:13.858
to get you out of here.

17:13.959 --> 17:16.398
So why don't you take us
to your friends?

17:16.499 --> 17:18.291
Through here.

17:19.666 --> 17:22.084
Daddy!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.084
It's okay.
It's all right.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.834
What is it?

17:32.583 --> 17:33.399
I saw you

17:33.499 --> 17:35.192
when you were little...

17:35.292 --> 17:38.418
in this playground with Dad.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.792
(<i>clock ticking</i>)

17:49.292 --> 17:51.276
Leo?

17:51.376 --> 17:53.667
Leo?

17:59.126 --> 18:00.399
It's about time.

18:00.499 --> 18:01.399
Piper, I was busy.

18:01.499 --> 18:04.192
Well, don't you have
orb waiting?

18:04.292 --> 18:05.901
Look, it's not fair
to my other clients

18:06.001 --> 18:08.567
if I keep getting calls from you
while I'm at work.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.734
Look, I just have
one teensy favor.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.399
Prue and Phoebe never came back
from lunch,

18:13.499 --> 18:15.817
and they haven't
been returning any
of my phone calls.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.859
And I know I'm probably just
being paranoid,

18:17.959 --> 18:21.609
but can't you do that check-
the-supernatural-radar thing

18:21.709 --> 18:22.109
that you do?

18:22.209 --> 18:25.499
I'm sure it's fine.
They're just...

18:31.167 --> 18:33.042
Leo?

18:35.209 --> 18:36.192
Not good?

18:36.292 --> 18:37.692
I can't sense them anywhere.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.151
It's like they just...

18:39.251 --> 18:40.792
Disappeared.

18:43.292 --> 18:44.483
All right, is that all of you?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.984
All that's left.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.359
Are you gonna save us?

18:48.459 --> 18:49.109
We're gonna try.

18:49.209 --> 18:51.109
PRUE:
All right, I think the
only way out of here

18:51.209 --> 18:53.834
is to go through
the person that...

18:54.750 --> 18:56.817
...put us here
in the first place.

18:56.917 --> 18:57.525
The ice cream man?

18:57.625 --> 18:58.650
But how are we supposed
to find him?

18:58.750 --> 19:01.650
PRUE:
Something tells me that's
not gonna be very hard.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.234
Why not?

19:02.334 --> 19:04.667
Oh, because he's right
over there!

19:05.792 --> 19:06.537
Okay, you kids stay here.

19:06.547 --> 19:09.399
We'll take care
of the Good Humor Man.

19:09.499 --> 19:10.026
Let's go.

19:10.126 --> 19:11.399
PHOEBE:
There he is
by the slide.

19:11.499 --> 19:12.834
PRUE:
All right.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.399
Oh, hey, wait,
look at that!

19:15.499 --> 19:17.151
What does that
look like to you?

19:17.251 --> 19:18.442
The street
from the back of the truck.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.901
That's right,
the way out.

19:20.001 --> 19:21.359
PHOEBE:
Okay.

19:21.459 --> 19:24.109
All that we need
now are the, uh...

19:24.209 --> 19:25.692
Hey, we were just coming
to get you.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.500
Come on.
We're going home.

19:29.499 --> 19:30.399
Come on, come on, come on!

19:30.499 --> 19:32.500
(<i>gasps</i>)
One down.

19:35.126 --> 19:36.499
Here comes another one!

19:37.499 --> 19:38.692
No!

19:38.792 --> 19:40.917
Oh, hurry, get.

19:42.709 --> 19:43.692
Okay, I'm going next.

19:43.792 --> 19:44.399
Okay Phoebe, go.

19:44.499 --> 19:45.234
(<i>yells</i>)

19:45.334 --> 19:46.775
Keep them away from the door!

19:46.875 --> 19:47.984
Whoo!

19:48.084 --> 19:50.042
Oh!

19:50.499 --> 19:52.151
Ari, come on.
Hurry up!

19:52.251 --> 19:53.792
(<i>gasps</i>)

20:02.499 --> 20:03.875
(<i>screams</i>)

20:07.209 --> 20:08.109
Oh, my God!

20:08.209 --> 20:08.734
Actually,

20:08.834 --> 20:09.912
(<i>deep demon voice</i>):
quite the opposite.

20:09.922 --> 20:13.359
Okay, we need to keep him away
from the other kids.

20:13.459 --> 20:14.399
I don't think they'll listen
to you.

20:14.499 --> 20:17.499
(<i>normal voice</i>):
You're not the boss of them.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.399
Did you do it?

20:21.499 --> 20:23.483
Say thank you
to the witches.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.292
BOTH:
Thank you.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.834
(<i>all laughing</i>)

20:32.709 --> 20:36.276
LEO:
 Why don't we try focusing
 on the positive?

20:36.376 --> 20:37.901
They're together.

20:38.001 --> 20:39.067
That's it?
That's your positive?

20:39.167 --> 20:42.234
Because I've got a list a mile
long in the negative column.

20:42.334 --> 20:43.775
They've been gone
all night, Leo.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.399
And not even you can find them.

20:45.499 --> 20:47.109
I'm sure they're fine.

20:47.209 --> 20:48.192
You don't know that.

20:48.292 --> 20:48.942
Piper, any minute,

20:49.042 --> 20:50.079
they are gonna walk
through that door

20:50.089 --> 20:51.400
with a perfectly good
explanation.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.625
PHOEBE:
Piper?!

20:54.917 --> 20:56.126
See?

20:56.625 --> 20:58.984
Prue, Phoebe, hi.

20:59.084 --> 21:01.525
Oh, hey. Oh!

21:01.625 --> 21:02.817
Okay.

21:02.917 --> 21:03.984
Where were we?

21:04.084 --> 21:05.399
Oh, I would like
to know the same thing.

21:05.499 --> 21:07.942
All that we know is
that we have to go back.

21:08.042 --> 21:08.567
Wait a minute.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.399
Is this demon
or sibling related?

21:10.499 --> 21:11.399
PHOEBE:
A little bit of both.

21:11.499 --> 21:13.525
We thought
that the good guys
were bad guys,

21:13.625 --> 21:15.109
and in trying
to vanquish them,

21:15.209 --> 21:16.234
we helped
the real bad guys,

21:16.334 --> 21:18.359
which were dead ringers
for good guys.

21:18.459 --> 21:19.399
Was that English?

21:19.499 --> 21:20.494
PRUE:
How about we fill in
the blanks

21:20.504 --> 21:23.067
as we climb the stairs
to that big book in the attic?

21:23.167 --> 21:25.167
Good idea.

21:27.959 --> 21:32.234
So he's a demonic dogcatcher
and he uses ice cream as bait?

21:32.334 --> 21:35.399
Great news for the lactose-
intolerant demons.

21:35.499 --> 21:38.734
Nothing in here on the
demon kids who escaped.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.525
That we helped escape.

21:40.625 --> 21:43.525
PRUE:
But there's a whole page
dedicated to the ice cream man.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.318
What?

21:44.418 --> 21:46.942
He is mortal.

21:47.042 --> 21:47.483
What?

21:47.583 --> 21:48.399
Do you remember when demons

21:48.499 --> 21:52.399
looked like demons
and innocents looked
like innocents?

21:52.499 --> 21:53.399
Who changed
the rules on us?

21:53.499 --> 21:55.984
Wait. If he's mortal,
how does he do it?

21:56.084 --> 21:57.901
It's not him.

21:58.001 --> 21:58.859
Bingo. It's a song.

21:58.959 --> 22:01.399
It says the ice cream man plays
the devil's chord,

22:01.499 --> 22:02.399
which is a series of notes

22:02.499 --> 22:03.399
that when sounded together,

22:03.499 --> 22:06.400
specifically attract demon kids
like moths to a flame.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.984
More like moths to nothing.

22:08.084 --> 22:10.399
That's what's inside
the truck-- nothing.

22:10.499 --> 22:12.067
That why he pulls
them in there.

22:12.167 --> 22:15.067
The Nothing
is the only thing
that can vanquish them.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.318
So they might be pint-sized,
but they're bad asses.

22:18.418 --> 22:20.483
Right, but if they couldn't get
out on their own,

22:20.583 --> 22:21.483
how did you guys?

22:21.583 --> 22:24.500
Because he let us out.

22:27.126 --> 22:28.942
He tried to save us.

22:29.042 --> 22:30.399
And that is all she wrote,
literally.

22:30.499 --> 22:34.859
Uh, the Nothing doesn't
discriminate, good or evil;

22:34.959 --> 22:35.483
tastes the same.

22:35.583 --> 22:38.650
PIPER:
Now, the only person
who knows anything
about the escaped

22:38.750 --> 22:40.318
meanies is stuck on
the playground

22:40.418 --> 22:43.067
and is in serious danger
of becoming lunch himself.

22:43.167 --> 22:45.859
Right, and our powers don't
play, not in this situation.

22:45.959 --> 22:47.775
I mean, Pheebs and I tried
everything to get back in,

22:47.875 --> 22:49.525
but the door
wouldn't budge.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.192
Well, not everything.

22:51.292 --> 22:52.650
PIPER:
Hmm?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.667
Mind sharing
with the room?

22:55.499 --> 22:58.399
Phoebe had a premonition

22:58.499 --> 22:59.359
of me...

22:59.459 --> 23:01.775
And Dad in the playground.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.399
You were there?

23:03.499 --> 23:04.399
How?

23:04.499 --> 23:05.399
When?

23:05.499 --> 23:06.650
Only one way to find out.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.859
Right, but we don't even know
where he is.

23:08.959 --> 23:09.984
Never have,
not even now

23:10.084 --> 23:12.499
when he might actually
come in handy.

23:14.499 --> 23:15.399
He's here.

23:15.499 --> 23:17.499
Dad's in San Francisco.

23:18.001 --> 23:20.359
He's been here
for the last three months.

23:20.459 --> 23:21.109
So it was him

23:21.209 --> 23:22.650
that your friend Cara saw.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.567
And it was an e-mail from him
that I got yesterday

23:25.667 --> 23:27.942
that I didn't tell you guys
about.

23:28.042 --> 23:32.399
He's here,
an instant message away.

23:32.499 --> 23:34.192
Phoebe, this is...

23:34.292 --> 23:34.494
Huge,

23:34.504 --> 23:36.984
I know. And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you guys

23:37.084 --> 23:39.609
that I've been keeping in touch
with him,

23:39.709 --> 23:41.359
but,

23:41.459 --> 23:41.829
I wanted to.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.750
It just never seemed
like the right time.

23:45.709 --> 23:49.084
So I guess now
it's the right time.

23:50.001 --> 23:52.459
What do you think?

23:54.499 --> 23:55.917
Do we have a choice?

24:17.209 --> 24:18.399
Whatcha doing?

24:18.499 --> 24:20.234
Killing.
No kidding.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.399
Did anybody see you?

24:22.499 --> 24:25.817
Thought <i>I</i> was supposed to kill.
Was it fun?

24:25.917 --> 24:28.817
He screamed a lot.
(<i>laughs</i>)

24:28.917 --> 24:29.942
Cool.

24:30.042 --> 24:30.859
So, what do we do now?

24:30.959 --> 24:32.775
Well, I guess we waste
even more time

24:32.875 --> 24:33.609
while we pick up after you.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.942
But you said all we had to
do was find the truck...

24:37.042 --> 24:38.192
Not any truck.

24:38.292 --> 24:39.399
<i>The</i> truck.

24:39.499 --> 24:40.399
I already got rid

24:40.499 --> 24:42.234
of the ice cream man,
remember?

24:42.334 --> 24:43.318
The only people

24:43.418 --> 24:44.399
we might have to kill

24:44.499 --> 24:47.026
to get to the right truck
are those witches.

24:47.126 --> 24:47.495
But...

24:47.505 --> 24:49.318
And if you would've
paid attention,

24:49.418 --> 24:50.399
you would've known that.

24:50.499 --> 24:53.817
And you also
would've known...

24:53.917 --> 24:58.334
that this isn't the right truck.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.192
Now,

25:00.292 --> 25:02.359
I like killing
just as much as the next demon,

25:02.459 --> 25:03.901
but right now,
we've got to be smart,

25:04.001 --> 25:06.359
and trashing every regular
ice cream truck

25:06.459 --> 25:07.609
that we see is not smart.

25:07.709 --> 25:09.234
But it's fun.
And we'll have

25:09.334 --> 25:11.318
lots more fun
when this is all over.

25:11.418 --> 25:12.359
Promise?

25:12.459 --> 25:13.067
Yeah. But first,

25:13.167 --> 25:15.525
do you think
you can clean up this mess?

25:15.625 --> 25:18.499
I was waiting for you
to say that.

25:19.499 --> 25:21.192
(<i>air rushing</i>)

25:21.292 --> 25:21.942
Done.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.026
Welcome to
Club Switzerland.

25:24.126 --> 25:26.734
All right, could we just
sort of curb the sarcasm there?

25:26.834 --> 25:29.026
I just didn't really feel like
inviting him

25:29.126 --> 25:30.399
to our home
for tea and cookies.

25:30.499 --> 25:31.483
PHOEBE:
He's our father, Prue.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.942
This is family.
This is business.

25:33.042 --> 25:36.399
All right? And
don't even think about
giving me that look.

25:36.499 --> 25:37.399
If he gives us
any useful

25:37.499 --> 25:38.859
information about
the playground,

25:38.959 --> 25:41.192
I will be the very
first one to thank him.

25:41.292 --> 25:43.399
And then send him
packing.
Hm.

25:43.499 --> 25:46.399
These must be the sisters
I've heard so much about.

25:46.499 --> 25:47.399
Caleb... uh...

25:47.499 --> 25:49.817
And to think I almost
didn't swing by today.

25:49.917 --> 25:50.494
Okay, you know what?

25:50.504 --> 25:53.859
I've tried, I really have--
and you're not a bad guy--

25:53.959 --> 25:55.859
but obviously,
the part of your brain

25:55.959 --> 25:57.234
meant to take a hint wasn't

25:57.334 --> 25:59.109
wired together properly,
because

25:59.209 --> 26:00.276
you're not taking any!

26:00.376 --> 26:02.525
This is a really bad time.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.234
Oh. O-Okay.

26:04.334 --> 26:06.442
When will be a good time,
just...?

26:06.542 --> 26:08.399
Help me!

26:08.499 --> 26:08.870
Uh...

26:08.880 --> 26:11.276
You got a phone call--
it's in the office.

26:11.376 --> 26:13.109
Why don't I show you
where that's at?

26:13.209 --> 26:14.817
Uh, okay. Do you mind

26:14.917 --> 26:18.399
if I ask you
something?

26:18.499 --> 26:19.609
Hey, you're just lucky

26:19.709 --> 26:20.984
nobody got killed, okay?

26:21.084 --> 26:23.399
You hear what
I'm saying?

26:23.499 --> 26:24.917
(<i>door closes</i>)

26:30.792 --> 26:32.399
Well...

26:32.499 --> 26:35.609
would it be too much
to ask for a hug?

26:35.709 --> 26:37.399
It's good to see you,
Daddy.

26:37.499 --> 26:39.734
Oh, baby, you have no idea.

26:39.834 --> 26:41.500
(<i>scoffs</i>)

26:42.001 --> 26:44.442
Wow! What a place!
Is this yours, Piper?

26:44.542 --> 26:45.734
It's terrific.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.067
The three of you
together,

26:47.167 --> 26:48.567
I hardly know where to begin.

26:48.667 --> 26:49.775
Well, I have a suggestion.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.609
How about we just
cut to the chase?

26:51.709 --> 26:53.109
PIPER:
Uh, Prue, he just got here.

26:53.209 --> 26:55.442
Can't that wait, like,
five minutes?

26:55.542 --> 26:56.399
He's a businessman, Piper.

26:56.499 --> 26:58.192
I would think that he
would appreciate that.

26:58.292 --> 27:00.109
We can do the whole
family bonding thing

27:00.209 --> 27:01.567
once the work is
done, all right?

27:01.667 --> 27:02.525
So how about you
just tell us

27:02.625 --> 27:04.859
everything that you know
about the playground?

27:04.959 --> 27:07.067
Wh-Wh... What playground?

27:07.167 --> 27:08.567
PHOEBE:
Dad, I had a premonition;

27:08.667 --> 27:10.400
I know you were there.
And somebody's hurt,

27:10.500 --> 27:12.567
so we need to get back inside.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.399
(<i>groans</i>)

27:14.499 --> 27:15.276
Let it go.

27:15.376 --> 27:16.399
PRUE:
That may be
your motto,

27:16.499 --> 27:18.817
but we made a mistake, and we
would really like to fix it.

27:18.917 --> 27:22.318
So just tell us how you got in,
and we can handle it from there.

27:22.418 --> 27:23.399
We are big witches now.

27:23.499 --> 27:25.234
Yeah, but you're still my girls.

27:25.334 --> 27:26.318
Victor...

27:26.418 --> 27:28.001
Prue?

27:31.499 --> 27:33.792
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:34.959 --> 27:36.234
All right.

27:36.334 --> 27:38.942
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:39.042 --> 27:40.399
Yes, I was there.

27:40.499 --> 27:41.984
I went in after you,
and, uh...

27:42.084 --> 27:47.459
it was the last thing
I ever did as your father.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.692
You were at home with a cold
and must've been about six.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.609
Your mom had some errands
to run, so she took

27:53.709 --> 27:58.276
your sisters with her
and left me home
in charge of you.

27:58.376 --> 28:01.859
<i>You had asked me
 to read you a story.</i>

28:01.959 --> 28:03.276
<i>You used to love that.</i>

28:03.376 --> 28:05.318
<i>But the cold was
 too much for you.</i>

28:05.418 --> 28:06.400
<i>You only lasted a page or two,</i>

28:06.500 --> 28:09.734
<i>and I left your room--
 you were still sleeping.</i>

28:09.834 --> 28:12.525
<i>Never heard you
 come downstairs.</i>

28:12.625 --> 28:18.399
<i>You must have been looking
for a glass of water or... me.</i>

28:18.499 --> 28:21.234
<i>And that must have been
 when you heard it.</i>

28:21.334 --> 28:24.499
(<i>ice cream truck music plays</i>)

28:25.542 --> 28:26.399
The song.

28:26.499 --> 28:27.483
I mean, I heard
a truck drive by

28:27.583 --> 28:30.901
and stop a few doors down, but
I didn't think anything of it.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.609
It was an ice cream truck--

28:32.709 --> 28:33.817
how was I to know?

28:33.917 --> 28:34.494
But somehow you did.

28:34.504 --> 28:38.192
And you must have gone
into the living room
following that song.

28:38.292 --> 28:40.442
And that's when
you saw it happen.

28:40.542 --> 28:44.318
A little boy,
not much older than yourself.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.026
Yeah.

28:45.126 --> 28:49.234
He was standing by the truck,
and something pulled him in.

28:49.334 --> 28:50.399
He was so scared.

28:50.499 --> 28:52.399
And you ran out to help him.

28:52.499 --> 28:53.817
Just like yesterday.

28:53.917 --> 28:56.859
When I saw your bed was empty,
I lost my mind.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.859
The door was wide open.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.026
There was a truck parked
outside.

29:00.126 --> 29:02.400
I mean, I had no idea
what I was getting into,

29:02.500 --> 29:03.692
but I just had to go.

29:03.792 --> 29:05.418
You saved Prue.

29:06.126 --> 29:08.499
But I lost the three of you.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.162
PHOEBE:
You said that you left

29:11.172 --> 29:14.442
because Grams wanted
us to use our powers
and you didn't.

29:14.542 --> 29:17.399
That's the truth-- and now
you know the whole story.

29:17.499 --> 29:19.567
I mean,
when your grandmother found out,

29:19.667 --> 29:21.399
I had just brought Prue back,

29:21.499 --> 29:23.442
but being your father
wasn't good enough.

29:23.542 --> 29:24.984
I mean,
how could I ever protect you

29:25.084 --> 29:26.734
from something like that
happening again

29:26.834 --> 29:28.067
when I didn't have the powers?

29:28.167 --> 29:31.399
PHOEBE:
Okay, so the Book said

29:31.499 --> 29:32.525
the ice cream man is mortal.

29:32.625 --> 29:36.067
That's why he can go through
the door and we can't, right?

29:36.167 --> 29:39.067
PIPER:
So what do you say, Dad?

29:39.167 --> 29:40.834
We need your help.

29:45.542 --> 29:46.901
You know,
if this doesn't work,

29:47.001 --> 29:47.859
I can look back
and pinpoint

29:47.959 --> 29:49.567
the exact moment
where it all went wrong.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.525
And that moment's name
would be Dad?

29:52.625 --> 29:54.318
Prue, you got to admit,
if he can open

29:54.418 --> 29:55.399
the door,
then we kind of need him.

29:55.499 --> 29:56.650
It's all about
word choice, Piper.

29:56.750 --> 29:58.109
We don't need him,
we need

29:58.209 --> 29:59.525
his utter lack of power, right?

29:59.625 --> 30:01.525
He opens the door,
we save the day,

30:01.625 --> 30:03.192
we get on with our lives.

30:03.292 --> 30:04.151
It's a one-time group effort.

30:04.251 --> 30:08.192
Glad to see you have a healthy
handle on the situation, Prue.

30:08.292 --> 30:09.525
<i>I</i> think I do.

30:09.625 --> 30:11.483
So yeah, I was surprised
to hear from you.

30:11.583 --> 30:14.399
But why did you think that
I wouldn't let you back?

30:14.499 --> 30:16.400
Because as far back
as you can remember,

30:16.500 --> 30:18.276
I've done very little right
by you.

30:18.376 --> 30:19.734
I mean, if a guy,
let alone your own dad,

30:19.834 --> 30:23.109
walks out on you once, maybe
you give him a second chance,

30:23.209 --> 30:25.525
but if he appears
to make a habit of it...

30:25.625 --> 30:28.625
I never thought
you left by choice, Dad.

30:29.418 --> 30:31.567
Thank you, Phoebe.

30:31.667 --> 30:34.442
PRUE:
Okay, well, this is it.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.399
Uh, but there's
nothing here.

30:36.499 --> 30:38.276
Wait, we lost the truck?

30:38.376 --> 30:41.399
(<i>child laughs
in distance</i>)
Yeah,

30:41.499 --> 30:44.209
but we gained company.

30:45.126 --> 30:47.399
(<i>gasping, grunting</i>)

30:47.499 --> 30:48.959
(<i>giggles</i>)

30:50.251 --> 30:52.775
Oh, those kids so need
to be grounded.

30:52.875 --> 30:56.192
(<i>laughing</i>)
!
PIPER:
Ow, ow.

30:56.292 --> 30:56.901
Ow.

30:57.001 --> 30:57.775
Ooh, I don't get it.
Ow.

30:57.875 --> 30:59.400
All right, why pick
a fight and then run?

30:59.500 --> 31:02.399
Speaking of running,
we should run, because
they're getting away.

31:02.499 --> 31:05.399
No, we can't do that,
because we have to get
back into the truck.

31:05.499 --> 31:07.418
Not all of us. Come on, Piper.

31:08.459 --> 31:10.583
(<i>sighs</i>)
Nice work.

31:11.499 --> 31:13.359
All right, lost modes
of transport

31:13.459 --> 31:14.400
are definitely not
my forte, so...

31:14.500 --> 31:19.859
Prue, sometimes in life,
things happen for a reason,
no magic involved.

31:19.959 --> 31:24.399
Your truck's been towed.

31:24.499 --> 31:26.834
Right.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.399
VICTOR:
Need a hand?

31:37.499 --> 31:41.834
No, I don't need a hand;
I don't need anything.

31:44.251 --> 31:46.399
This is where
he pulled us in,

31:46.499 --> 31:48.276
but since he's still
trapped inside,

31:48.376 --> 31:51.817
I'm guessing the only way in
is through the exit.

31:51.917 --> 31:55.399
(<i>door rattling</i>)
(grunting)

31:55.499 --> 31:59.209
All right,
let's just do this.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.334
You <i>can</i> do it, right?

32:03.499 --> 32:04.525
(<i>sighs</i>):
Well...

32:04.625 --> 32:06.901
let's just say
that chasing demons

32:07.001 --> 32:08.859
is not exactly my day job.

32:08.959 --> 32:11.109
(<i>sighs</i>)
All right.

32:11.209 --> 32:15.192
It helps if
you specifically
focus on the task.

32:15.292 --> 32:17.609
Don't think about
what's behind the door.

32:17.709 --> 32:19.400
That'll only distract you.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.192
Picture yourself
opening the door,

32:22.292 --> 32:26.499
see yourself
opening the door,
then just do it.

32:30.334 --> 32:32.542
(<i>Victor exhales</i>)

32:33.499 --> 32:36.901
(<i>air hissing</i>)

32:37.001 --> 32:39.234
Thanks for the advice.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.583
Just doing my job.

32:48.418 --> 32:52.400
This would be a lot easier
if things stopped moving.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.499
We left him right here.

32:55.376 --> 32:57.483
Unless...

32:57.583 --> 32:59.026
VICTOR:
The Nothing.

32:59.126 --> 33:00.399
Even mortals
have memories, Prue.

33:00.499 --> 33:02.026
I saw what it did
to those children.

33:02.126 --> 33:03.399
I know what it could've done
to him.

33:03.499 --> 33:04.609
And to us
if we don't act quickly.

33:04.709 --> 33:06.650
Yeah, well, at least
we agree upon one thing.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.650
ICE CREAM MAN:
Make that two.
And get out while you still can.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.859
(<i>ice cream man coughing</i>)
PRUE:
Oh, my God!

33:12.959 --> 33:15.399
I am so sorry, I didn't know.

33:15.499 --> 33:17.359
The mistake was mine.

33:17.459 --> 33:19.942
You're the Charmed Ones.

33:20.042 --> 33:21.817
You were saving innocents.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.276
How could you know
they weren't?

33:24.376 --> 33:25.318
How did you know?

33:25.418 --> 33:28.442
Let's just say we both
have friends in high places.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.026
The moment I
mistakenly

33:30.126 --> 33:31.483
pulled you
and your sister in,

33:31.583 --> 33:33.192
I was alerted.

33:33.292 --> 33:35.109
I was sent to save you.

33:35.209 --> 33:37.734
And you get this in return.

33:37.834 --> 33:39.192
(<i>wind whistling</i>)

33:39.292 --> 33:40.192
It's getting closer.

33:40.292 --> 33:42.817
All right, so you got us
out of here once.

33:42.917 --> 33:44.318
Now it's my turn.

33:44.418 --> 33:46.026
(<i>coughing</i>)

33:46.126 --> 33:49.234
The children, you must get them
back inside the playground.

33:49.334 --> 33:51.400
We will, and you're
gonna help us do it.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.525
I disabled the truck.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.775
You need to fix it.
Play the song.

33:54.875 --> 33:58.026
Don't you dare--
you stay with us!

33:58.126 --> 34:00.418
Inside my...

34:01.542 --> 34:03.234
It's for the truck.

34:03.334 --> 34:04.650
(<i>wheezing cough</i>)

34:04.750 --> 34:07.942
It's almost here.
You go first, okay?

34:08.042 --> 34:10.442
I can be replaced.
You can't.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.025
No!

34:12.126 --> 34:14.792
(<i>ice cream man yells</i>)

34:16.083 --> 34:19.942
Prue, it'll be back!
We got to get out now!

34:20.042 --> 34:20.817
You didn't fail.

34:20.917 --> 34:25.126
The only way you fail
is if you don't get back
and do what he asked.

34:27.126 --> 34:28.498
Come on.

34:34.958 --> 34:35.942
Why don't they ever run

34:36.042 --> 34:38.692
into a well-lit room
with nowhere to hide?

34:38.792 --> 34:40.318
Well, we know
they're somewhere,

34:40.418 --> 34:42.567
and I know what's
gonna give them away.

34:42.667 --> 34:44.109
How could you...?

34:44.208 --> 34:44.900
Shh!

34:45.001 --> 34:46.399
(<i>kids laughing</i>)

34:46.498 --> 34:47.734
ARI:
How bad did you want

34:47.833 --> 34:50.359
to get off that playground?

34:50.458 --> 34:52.399
And now we're free.

34:52.498 --> 34:54.708
Don't you want
to <i>stay</i> free?

34:55.498 --> 34:56.318
Why do I get
the feeling

34:56.418 --> 34:57.692
these kids weren't
looking to pick

34:57.792 --> 34:58.942
a fight with
the Charmed Ones?

34:59.042 --> 35:00.984
They were just looking
for the truck,

35:01.084 --> 35:02.026
and we crashed
their party.

35:02.126 --> 35:03.901
But we're like
a mile ahead.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.400
I mean, we know
where it is.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.151
It's in the junkyard.

35:07.251 --> 35:09.026
Oh...

35:09.126 --> 35:09.859
Did I say a mile?

35:09.959 --> 35:12.399
Okay, so they know,
but it's three of us

35:12.499 --> 35:13.442
versus three of them.

35:13.542 --> 35:15.499
We're even-- and bigger.

35:16.292 --> 35:17.109
PHOEBE:
Uh, Sis,

35:17.209 --> 35:18.901
I think you need
to count again.

35:19.001 --> 35:20.483
(<i>kids laughing</i>)

35:20.583 --> 35:21.399
When in doubt...

35:21.499 --> 35:22.399
Bring
reinforcements.

35:22.499 --> 35:26.942
All that's left for us
to do is destroy the truck.

35:27.042 --> 35:27.609
Yeah.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.984
(<i>kids laughing</i>)

35:29.084 --> 35:29.817
Prue!

35:29.917 --> 35:31.499
And Dad. Let's go.

35:39.499 --> 35:41.399
Do you think they're
here already?

35:41.499 --> 35:41.901
Probably.

35:42.001 --> 35:44.192
Do you think they know
<i>we're</i> here already?

35:44.292 --> 35:44.901
Probably.

35:45.001 --> 35:46.399
(<i>kids laughing</i>)

35:46.499 --> 35:50.026
Okay. Do they do that
because they think it's funny,

35:50.126 --> 35:51.192
or just to freak us out?

35:51.292 --> 35:52.984
All we have to do is
hold off the demons

35:53.084 --> 35:54.151
until Dad and
Prue get out.

35:54.251 --> 35:55.399
Uh, you haven't
by any chance had

35:55.499 --> 35:58.109
a premonition that this
is all gonna turn out okay

35:58.209 --> 36:01.499
and you've just neglected
to inform your kin?

36:03.334 --> 36:05.318
Okay. I think
they're surrounding us.

36:05.418 --> 36:07.775
No, don't say that.
We're not surrounded

36:07.875 --> 36:10.209
until they're all around us.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.318
Okay, how bad could the odds be?

36:13.418 --> 36:16.151
I mean, sure there's
a whole bunch of them, but

36:16.251 --> 36:19.499
we're witches, right?
And you have the power of...

up at the top.

When I decide
I want to have kids,

you remind me of this day.

What are
you doing here?

Why did you bring <i>him</i> here?

39:11.667 --> 39:13.901
He's supposed
to be here, Piper.

39:14.001 --> 39:15.650
You fixed my wheels, thanks.

ice cream man.

back at the club.

Everything's happened
the way it was meant to.

over. It's his time.

Ah, strictly
professional.

39:27.126 --> 39:29.817
I was lost, but until
I was sure who you were,

39:29.917 --> 39:32.109
I-I couldn't just
come out and say,

39:32.209 --> 39:33.276
"Hey, are you a Charmed One?

39:33.376 --> 39:37.276
Because I need you to take me
to my demon-catching truck."

You don't have to keep this

40:20.042 --> 40:21.234
a secret anymore, Phoebe.

40:21.334 --> 40:21.942

40:22.042 --> 40:23.499
I mean in anything.

Hey, what's the story

40:28.792 --> 40:30.692
with this Leo
character, anyway?

40:30.792 --> 40:32.318
How much does he
know about you?

40:32.418 --> 40:34.609
Uh, just about
everything.

40:34.709 --> 40:35.567
Oh, so he's, um...

40:35.667 --> 40:36.567
He's a wonderful man, yes.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.692
Well, still, I think
I'll have a little

40:38.792 --> 40:40.192
chat with him some time.

Dad.

40:41.167 --> 40:42.583

40:43.750 --> 40:45.109
I'm not saying
goodbye.

that's, uh, sort of
why I came to town.

For this job
interview, and, uh,

40:58.126 --> 41:01.859
although it would entail
some travel, I'd be based

41:01.959 --> 41:03.442
here in San Francisco,
and, um...

41:03.542 --> 41:06.359
if you guys think that
occasionally this town

41:06.459 --> 41:08.399
is big enough
for the four of us,

catching up to do.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.499
It's okay. It's different now.
