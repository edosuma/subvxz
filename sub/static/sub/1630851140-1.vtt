01:20.420 --> 01:24.057
- Hi!
- Hey, what's up?

01:24.090 --> 01:27.360
Well, I finished the nursery.

01:27.393 --> 01:30.330
You were right.
He's gonna love it.

01:30.363 --> 01:33.466
- Where are ya?
- Not far.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.001
Maybe 30 minutes away, I guess.

01:35.034 --> 01:38.638
Can you hang on a sec?
I really need to pee.

01:38.671 --> 01:40.741
I'm pulling over.

01:52.418 --> 01:56.890
- It's getting dark.
- I can see that.

01:58.991 --> 02:01.595
Just hang on a sec.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.102
Michelle?

02:41.135 --> 02:46.840
Michelle?! Michelle!

02:46.874 --> 02:51.379
Oh, my god!

03:48.935 --> 03:52.572
Oh, here we go. No, no, no, no.

03:52.606 --> 03:54.642
- Hi, Claire.
- Julian.

03:54.675 --> 03:56.810
Hey, Ben.

03:56.844 --> 04:00.481
- You haven't returned my calls!
- No.

04:00.513 --> 04:03.016
And why is that?

04:03.050 --> 04:05.084
I have nothing to say.

04:05.118 --> 04:07.154
- OK, I think you might have.
- Ben...

04:07.187 --> 04:09.991
No, no, it's fine.
I just wanna hear her story.

04:11.225 --> 04:13.027
- Out of my hands now.
- Really?

04:13.059 --> 04:16.095
I was helping that boy.

04:16.129 --> 04:18.898
Everybody knew that.

04:18.932 --> 04:22.470
He was turning a corner,
making progress in our sessions

04:22.502 --> 04:24.070
and now he's gone.

04:24.103 --> 04:27.774
Why? What happened between
you two out there?

04:31.278 --> 04:33.013
Come on.

04:33.045 --> 04:35.715
Fine!

05:04.044 --> 05:06.981
- What's going on?
- It's Luke Dawson.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.583
Have you spoken to him?

05:10.617 --> 05:12.552
I tried to,
but he didn't say anything.

05:12.586 --> 05:16.624
- How did he seem?
- He's a bit fucked up.

05:16.657 --> 05:20.495
I didn't
know he had a gun, though.

05:43.951 --> 05:46.720
Hey!

05:49.122 --> 05:52.059
- Ah! Thanks.
- Pleasure.

05:52.091 --> 05:56.095
- You alright?
- Sure.

05:56.129 --> 05:58.732
Everything's
gonna be OK, Claire.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.736
Is it?

06:04.071 --> 06:06.574
Small town. You know how it is.

06:06.607 --> 06:07.741
Yeah.

06:07.773 --> 06:09.610
Small town, small people.

06:09.643 --> 06:15.349
Hey! I don't know about that.
We've just gotta wait it out.

06:15.381 --> 06:17.617
You'll be back at
work in no time.

06:17.650 --> 06:19.852
I don't wanna talk about it.

06:19.886 --> 06:23.991
OK. What WOULD you
like to talk about?

06:29.362 --> 06:31.764
Maybe I'll leave
you to it tonight.

06:31.797 --> 06:33.132
See what the boys are up to.

06:33.165 --> 06:34.934
No, wait. Wait!

06:34.968 --> 06:37.972
- What?
- Stay.

06:39.071 --> 06:41.074
Sit down.

09:17.063 --> 09:19.366
Hello.

09:19.399 --> 09:22.102
Is that Claire Nash?

09:22.135 --> 09:23.337
Yes, it is.

09:23.370 --> 09:25.005
Claire, it's your Uncle Cliff.

09:25.038 --> 09:27.508
Hi. How are you?

09:27.540 --> 09:29.309
I'm well, it's been a while.

09:29.342 --> 09:32.446
Yes! A long time. Are you back?

09:32.478 --> 09:34.247
I am. It's a long story.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.150
But, Claire,
I have some bad news.

09:36.183 --> 09:39.319
I'm afraid Robert
has passed away.

09:40.554 --> 09:42.021
How?

09:42.054 --> 09:43.266
He was found dead in the forest.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.857
Can you come home?

09:44.891 --> 09:47.294
I tried to contact you.
Your number was hard to find.

09:47.327 --> 09:49.997
Yes. No, of course,
nobody would know.

09:50.030 --> 09:55.903
Yeah, I'll come.
Um, will you be there?

09:55.935 --> 09:57.069
Yes, I'm still in town.

09:57.102 --> 09:58.237
I just wanted to find you.

09:58.271 --> 10:01.809
OK. Thanks for letting me know.

10:01.842 --> 10:03.544
Bye.

10:24.598 --> 10:28.301
- This has to stop.
- It's not going to stop.

10:28.334 --> 10:31.070
And one day, she will
follow. She has to.

10:31.103 --> 10:33.073
She doesn't have to!

10:33.106 --> 10:35.242
I've seen it!

10:35.275 --> 10:36.977
She will see it as well.

10:37.010 --> 10:41.148
- Sarah, wait.
- Don't be afraid.

10:41.180 --> 10:46.286
Sarah! Sarah!

11:13.579 --> 11:15.348
Claire!

11:19.486 --> 11:21.188
What are you doing?

11:21.221 --> 11:23.557
Just getting some air.

11:23.589 --> 11:25.024
I've gotta go away.

11:26.293 --> 11:27.895
Someone's died.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.563
I'm going home.

11:29.596 --> 11:32.065
Oh... OK.

11:32.098 --> 11:34.234
Is there anything I can do?

11:37.170 --> 11:38.972
I'm so sorry.

11:39.005 --> 11:42.109
- Sorry?
- For everything.

11:42.141 --> 11:43.443
You keep saying that!

11:43.476 --> 11:45.545
- I've gotta go.
- Claire! Wait!

11:45.578 --> 11:49.249
You don't fucking get it,
do you? I'm not right.

11:49.281 --> 11:51.184
Nothing's right.

11:51.217 --> 11:54.889
And right now,
I just have to go home.

15:03.343 --> 15:05.312
Thanks for coming, Claire.

15:05.344 --> 15:06.612
Uncle Cliff.

15:10.516 --> 15:12.852
Look at you. All grown up.

15:12.886 --> 15:13.926
You look like your mother.

15:18.757 --> 15:20.694
What happened?

15:20.727 --> 15:23.196
He was found dead in the forest.

15:23.228 --> 15:27.133
It wasn't suspicious.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.535
I'm so sorry, Claire.

15:28.568 --> 15:30.603
He wasn't well.

15:30.636 --> 15:32.638
These last few
years have been tough.

15:32.671 --> 15:34.840
Things have changed.

15:34.873 --> 15:40.679
- How?
- Things are just... different.

15:40.713 --> 15:44.251
I'm glad you came.

15:44.284 --> 15:45.452
Thanks for letting me know.

15:45.484 --> 15:47.753
I'm sorry it wasn't in time
for the funeral.

15:47.786 --> 15:50.891
I didn't know where to find you.
It's been a long time.

15:50.924 --> 15:53.793
It has.

15:53.825 --> 15:56.195
- You're going to the farm?
- Mm.

15:56.228 --> 15:58.831
Good. I think there are some
things there to sort out.

15:58.865 --> 16:01.168
Your dad left things
in a bit of a start.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.337
The bank is going to be
taking it back soon.

16:06.305 --> 16:09.208
And St Margaret's?

16:09.242 --> 16:12.378
I haven't been back.

16:12.411 --> 16:17.416
You're all I have left.

18:03.588 --> 18:06.492
"Dear Robert,"

18:06.526 --> 18:08.628
"I write once again regarding
our beloved Sarah"

18:08.661 --> 18:12.065
"for whom I now
hold grave fears."

18:12.098 --> 18:15.969
"Everyone has fled St Margaret's
as she spirals into madness.

18:16.001 --> 18:17.771
"I can't bear it."

18:17.803 --> 18:21.073
"My blood is chilled and I call
on our Lord God to guide me"

18:21.107 --> 18:24.376
"but I fear that
he no longer hears."

18:24.409 --> 18:28.947
"She talks incessantly of being
drawn into the forest."

18:28.981 --> 18:31.651
"And of summoning a demon.

18:31.684 --> 18:33.420
"I believe this
is behind the sickness

18:33.453 --> 18:34.953
"that has fallen on Blackwood,

18:34.986 --> 18:36.522
"the men fleeing,

18:36.556 --> 18:38.758
"and the malaise the women
seem to be falling under.

18:38.790 --> 18:40.960
"She talks of the price
to be paid.

18:40.992 --> 18:43.963
"The blood and the
bones of the newborn.

18:43.995 --> 18:46.365
"She wants Claire
home to join her.

18:46.398 --> 18:48.702
"She says that Claire is
the next in line.

18:48.734 --> 18:51.471
"I suspect witchcraft."

18:51.503 --> 18:54.674
"I implore you to leave
and keep Claire away."

18:54.706 --> 18:56.742
"Pray for me, Robert, and flee."

18:56.776 --> 18:59.079
"Clifford."

19:51.864 --> 19:55.402
What do you think about
when it's dark?

19:55.434 --> 19:57.838
The sunrise.

19:59.972 --> 20:03.777
Are you afraid of the dark?

20:03.809 --> 20:06.512
- No.
- Good girl.

20:08.947 --> 20:12.684
If Mummy goes away
for a little while,

20:12.717 --> 20:15.487
will you be strong for Daddy?

20:15.521 --> 20:17.056
Where are you going?

20:17.088 --> 20:19.925
I'll never be far from you.

20:19.959 --> 20:25.999
Claire, I don't ever want you
to be afraid of the dark.

20:26.031 --> 20:28.534
Can you promise me that, Angel?

20:28.568 --> 20:32.439
I promise.

21:17.582 --> 21:22.888
- What are you doing, mate?
- Thinking.

21:22.922 --> 21:24.958
Thinking about going away.

21:24.991 --> 21:28.862
Oh, yeah, nice. On a holiday.

21:30.162 --> 21:32.866
No, just away.

22:11.803 --> 22:14.974
Claire...

23:13.866 --> 23:18.237
I want you to always be
proud of who you are, Claire.

23:18.270 --> 23:19.806
And where you come from.

23:19.838 --> 23:22.241
I will.

23:22.273 --> 23:24.242
Our secret goes a very
long way back.

23:24.276 --> 23:27.747
Through all the women in our
family before us.

23:27.780 --> 23:31.283
Why do you go into
the forest at night, Mama?

23:31.317 --> 23:32.785
There's something there.

23:32.818 --> 23:35.722
Something that Mummy needs
very much.

23:35.754 --> 23:37.022
What is it?

23:37.056 --> 23:40.727
You'll know
when the time is right.

25:12.017 --> 25:14.953
Uncle Cliff!

25:29.934 --> 25:32.838
Uncle Cliff!

25:45.317 --> 25:47.420
Hello?

25:52.524 --> 25:55.094
Hello-o!

25:59.231 --> 26:01.367
Hello?

26:09.441 --> 26:11.344
Hi.

26:11.376 --> 26:15.080
- You scared me.
- Sorry. I was asleep.

26:15.114 --> 26:17.150
How are things at the farm?

26:17.183 --> 26:22.989
I found these.
What do they mean?

26:23.021 --> 26:24.557
What happened to her?

26:24.589 --> 26:27.459
- It was a long time ago.
- What happened to her?

26:27.492 --> 26:29.962
- Weren't you running the joint?
- Claire...

26:29.994 --> 26:32.231
It's not straightforward.
It's complicated.

26:32.263 --> 26:33.431
Sarah was very sick.

26:33.464 --> 26:34.934
I'm sorry, Uncle Cliff,

26:34.966 --> 26:36.844
but things have not been going
very well for me.

26:36.868 --> 26:38.905
Things are happening to me
that I can't explain.

26:38.937 --> 26:40.572
I want to know what
happened to my mother

26:40.606 --> 26:43.009
because I think those
are the answers that I need.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.477
Dad told me nothing.

26:45.511 --> 26:46.945
Just that she went away

26:46.979 --> 26:48.422
and that you were going to look
after her.

26:48.446 --> 26:50.148
And then she died.

26:50.182 --> 26:51.217
And then I read this.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.586
So I'm sure you understand that

26:53.618 --> 26:56.422
I'm a little bit jittery and
a little bit fucking curious.

26:56.454 --> 26:59.324
So I would like some answers
and if you

26:59.357 --> 27:04.363
could help me find some answers,
I would be ever so grateful.

27:04.396 --> 27:09.301
I understand.
Of course I'll help.

27:09.335 --> 27:10.569
Thank you.

27:10.603 --> 27:15.041
But I'm afraid I have to go
and meet someone.

27:15.073 --> 27:20.078
Running late.
Come back tonight, OK?

27:20.111 --> 27:23.882
Can you see yourself out?

27:53.078 --> 27:56.316
Morning.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.003
Hi.

28:19.570 --> 28:21.607
Nice doll.

28:29.181 --> 28:30.316
Hi.

28:30.348 --> 28:32.117
Hi.

28:33.284 --> 28:34.619
On the house.

28:34.653 --> 28:37.390
- Thanks.
- Passing through?

28:37.423 --> 28:39.692
Nope.

28:39.724 --> 28:41.526
Staying a while?

28:41.559 --> 28:42.928
A little.

28:42.962 --> 28:45.431
What brings you
to our little town?

28:48.099 --> 28:50.502
A death. Robert Nash.

28:53.137 --> 28:56.574
- He's my father.
- I'm sorry.

28:56.607 --> 28:59.645
- You knew him?
- Not really.

28:59.677 --> 29:03.482
I knew of him.
You know. Small town.

29:04.450 --> 29:06.251
I'm Rachel.

29:09.288 --> 29:14.359
- Claire.
- Pleased to meet you, Claire.

29:18.262 --> 29:20.632
- It's quiet.
- Is it?

29:20.665 --> 29:24.602
- Yes.
- Hm.

29:24.636 --> 29:27.139
- Where is everybody?
- Dunno.

29:28.507 --> 29:32.211
The police station
appears to be closed.

29:32.243 --> 29:34.414
You know when it might open?

29:35.013 --> 29:36.281
Right.

29:36.315 --> 29:39.485
We enjoy the quiet. You'll see.

29:39.518 --> 29:41.220
I'm sure.

29:41.252 --> 29:43.956
Where are you staying?

29:45.223 --> 29:49.494
Thanks for the drink.
But I've got to go.

29:49.528 --> 29:53.132
Sure. Anytime.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.603
Jen!

30:35.273 --> 30:37.207
Jen.

30:37.209 --> 30:39.378
Hi.

30:39.411 --> 30:41.447
Hello, Claire.

30:43.549 --> 30:45.283
Hi.

30:45.317 --> 30:48.820
- How are you?
- I'm well.

30:48.854 --> 30:54.427
- Well. Look at you.
- I heard about your father.

30:54.460 --> 30:55.795
I'm sorry.

30:55.828 --> 31:00.066
It's OK. It's been a long time.

31:00.098 --> 31:04.403
I have a little boy. Ricky.

31:04.435 --> 31:06.704
- Nice.
- After his father.

31:06.738 --> 31:08.541
Who's that?

31:08.573 --> 31:09.441
Rick Jenkins.

31:09.474 --> 31:12.711
They're not here right now.

31:12.743 --> 31:16.482
He would've been four
this month.

31:29.627 --> 31:32.764
Where are they, Jen?

31:35.134 --> 31:37.636
Let's get out of here.

31:45.243 --> 31:47.178
You remember?

31:47.212 --> 31:51.317
- Nigel Dobson.
- Nigel Dobson.

31:52.651 --> 31:54.553
Did you do it?

31:54.586 --> 31:57.556
You know I did. You dared me.

31:57.588 --> 31:59.492
I did.

31:59.524 --> 32:02.293
I wonder where he is now.

32:02.327 --> 32:05.431
- He left.
- And Rick?

32:05.463 --> 32:08.533
- Where's Rick?
- He went too.

32:08.567 --> 32:12.271
- Where did they go?
- Away.

32:12.303 --> 32:15.507
The kids?

32:15.540 --> 32:19.511
There's no kids, is there?

32:19.544 --> 32:22.780
- What about St. Margaret's?
- What about it?

32:22.813 --> 32:24.916
Is it still running?

32:24.950 --> 32:31.423
Not sure. Maybe.

32:31.455 --> 32:38.130
Maybe? Come on, Jen. It's me
you're talking to.

32:44.235 --> 32:47.172
She came at night.

32:48.773 --> 32:51.876
She knocked on the door.

32:51.909 --> 32:54.312
I answered the door.

32:54.346 --> 32:57.383
But no one was there.

32:57.415 --> 32:59.918
And when I went back inside...

33:01.386 --> 33:02.620
he was gone.

33:02.654 --> 33:05.391
She... she took him.

33:05.424 --> 33:09.295
- Why?
- She took others as well.

33:09.328 --> 33:14.800
Other children. Babies.
Soon no one was having children.

33:14.832 --> 33:18.403
Now there are no children.

33:18.436 --> 33:21.940
But I know why she did it.

33:21.973 --> 33:24.376
I know what she wants.

33:24.408 --> 33:29.781
She wants what is
best for all of us.

33:29.815 --> 33:33.686
She is wonderful.

33:33.719 --> 33:37.323
And terrible.

33:37.356 --> 33:41.327
Sometimes, she comes back.

33:41.359 --> 33:43.896
- Back?
- Yes.

33:43.928 --> 33:50.535
She brings things.
Little... things.

33:50.569 --> 33:53.772
What things?

33:55.674 --> 33:59.011
I miss him.

33:59.043 --> 34:04.949
I miss my little boy.
I miss his smell.

34:04.982 --> 34:07.485
His little hands.

34:07.519 --> 34:09.254
His face when he sleeps.

34:09.287 --> 34:15.860
But I understand -
how else could it be?

35:47.118 --> 35:49.555
Where's the cop?

35:51.722 --> 35:54.425
Sergeant Walker.

35:54.459 --> 35:58.564
Claire Nash. Robert, my father.

35:58.597 --> 36:01.700
Did you know him?

36:05.035 --> 36:07.872
Sergeant Walker, I just want to
know what happened to him.

36:07.906 --> 36:09.642
What can you tell me?

36:15.814 --> 36:17.082
Do you remember my mother?

36:17.115 --> 36:18.149
I know why you're here.

36:18.182 --> 36:20.418
- Really?
- This is my town.

36:20.452 --> 36:21.763
My responsibility.
I won't let you.

36:21.787 --> 36:23.555
Let me what?

36:23.588 --> 36:25.466
I will not let you ruin it
any more then you already have.

36:25.490 --> 36:27.926
This is my town, OK?

36:27.959 --> 36:30.428
You get out. Get out!

36:30.461 --> 36:32.097
All of you get out.

36:32.129 --> 36:34.133
What the fuck?!

36:34.165 --> 36:37.403
You OK?

36:37.435 --> 36:38.537
Yeah.

36:38.569 --> 36:41.774
You don't know who you are,
do you?

36:42.807 --> 36:44.510
What do you mean?

36:44.542 --> 36:48.479
It's getting dark out,
have you got somewhere to stay?

36:48.513 --> 36:49.882
I do.

36:49.914 --> 36:51.949
You could stay here.

36:51.982 --> 36:54.519
I could. But I won't.

36:54.553 --> 37:00.993
Sweetheart, be sure to stay in.

37:31.823 --> 37:34.693
Wait! Wait!

37:51.910 --> 37:55.080
Hello?

38:23.173 --> 38:25.477
Hello.

38:33.017 --> 38:35.687
Hello?

39:14.658 --> 39:17.828
I'm sorry.

39:17.861 --> 39:19.164
It's OK.

39:19.196 --> 39:21.732
So cold.

39:21.765 --> 39:24.168
So cold.

39:34.713 --> 39:36.848
She's come back.

39:36.881 --> 39:38.684
Who's come back?

39:47.225 --> 39:49.761
Claire...

39:51.129 --> 39:55.134
Don't. Don't leave me!

42:35.359 --> 42:37.428
- Will?
- Claire.

42:37.461 --> 42:39.196
- Hi.
- Where are you?

42:39.229 --> 42:41.465
I need your help.

42:41.499 --> 42:43.868
Help? Sure, I can come now.

42:43.901 --> 42:45.803
No, no, no. Don't come,
just listen. OK?

42:45.836 --> 42:48.339
Um, I need you to find out

42:48.372 --> 42:53.244
about a possible suicide,
Robert Nash.

42:53.278 --> 42:56.214
- Is that your father?
- Yeah.

42:56.247 --> 42:59.518
I'm in the police station.

42:59.551 --> 43:03.121
Tell me what's going on, Claire.

43:03.153 --> 43:07.391
Um, it's difficult to explain.

43:07.425 --> 43:10.495
- Oh, Jesus, Claire...
- Write this down to.

43:10.528 --> 43:13.799
St Margaret's clinic
in Blackwood.

43:13.832 --> 43:16.268
It's close down, OK?
Find out what you can.

43:16.301 --> 43:17.836
Can you do that?

43:17.868 --> 43:20.504
Yes. But I really think
it's best that...

43:20.537 --> 43:25.443
Will, just... Just trust me, OK?

43:25.475 --> 43:31.883
I've got to go. I love you.

43:31.915 --> 43:34.153
I love you too.

43:40.191 --> 43:43.028
Missing a piece.

43:47.097 --> 43:49.500
You know what I mean?

43:50.100 --> 43:52.403
No.

43:52.437 --> 43:55.841
Oh, I think you do.

43:55.874 --> 44:01.413
Well, why don't
you tell me, then?

44:01.446 --> 44:05.984
This town's in your blood,
isn't it?

44:07.651 --> 44:11.055
I remember you.

44:11.089 --> 44:13.458
Little girl Nash.

44:13.490 --> 44:16.227
Strange little girl
from a strange family.

44:16.260 --> 44:21.365
Lunatic family. On the fringe of
town.

44:21.399 --> 44:25.069
Lunatic mum. Lunatic dad.

44:25.102 --> 44:29.206
I know who you really are.
You're not a cop.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.516
There's something in that forest

44:30.540 --> 44:32.309
and I'm gonna find
out what it wants,

44:32.343 --> 44:34.011
I'm gonna find out what you,

44:34.044 --> 44:36.089
and I'm gonna find out what
your freaky fucking family want.

44:36.113 --> 44:37.249
What do you know?

44:37.281 --> 44:39.917
It's not gonna happen,
you FUCKING witch!

44:46.691 --> 44:50.361
Back off!

44:56.968 --> 44:59.404
I don't want to fuck with you.

44:59.437 --> 45:02.908
I want to know
what's happening in this town

45:02.941 --> 45:05.944
and I'm not
leaving here until I find out.

45:44.448 --> 45:48.352
Forgive me.

46:21.084 --> 46:22.687
What the fuck?

46:29.727 --> 46:32.263
It was the cop.

46:32.296 --> 46:36.001
- I know. He called me.
- What was he thinking?

46:36.033 --> 46:38.336
I'm not sure. He may regret it,
though.

46:38.368 --> 46:40.071
People around here
won't like it.

46:40.104 --> 46:42.272
- The women.
- Why not?

46:42.305 --> 46:44.575
Having one of theirs harmed.

46:46.711 --> 46:49.647
Look at your mother.

46:51.515 --> 46:54.218
So beautiful.

46:56.620 --> 47:02.359
What happened at St Margaret's?
What happened to my mother?

47:02.392 --> 47:04.762
The hospital couldn't
take care of her.

47:04.796 --> 47:08.265
They tried for years.

47:08.298 --> 47:13.637
The trouble runs deep, Claire.
You should know that.

47:13.671 --> 47:18.076
And I knew she was troubled,
I felt it.

47:18.109 --> 47:23.114
What about you, Claire?
Are you troubled?

47:23.147 --> 47:27.252
No. No, I'm not.

47:27.285 --> 47:30.455
Keep going.

47:30.488 --> 47:34.392
Staff left, patients
disappeared.

47:34.425 --> 47:36.461
In the end,
your mother vanished.

47:36.493 --> 47:38.562
They never found her.
Presumed dead.

47:38.595 --> 47:40.330
What do you mean
'presumed dead'?

47:40.363 --> 47:45.202
I was told she was dead.
You told me she was dead.

47:45.236 --> 47:48.306
It was better that way, Claire.

47:50.274 --> 47:54.379
- What do these mean?
- What they say.

47:54.412 --> 47:57.082
- A demon?
- That's what she said.

47:57.115 --> 48:01.151
It's all she spoke
about in the end.

48:01.185 --> 48:04.322
Sometimes we see things.

48:04.354 --> 48:06.256
Things they see.

48:06.289 --> 48:08.859
Whether you want to or not.

48:08.892 --> 48:11.695
Sarah told me things
I hadn't heard before.

48:11.729 --> 48:14.332
What things?

48:14.365 --> 48:17.502
People telling me
all kinds of dark secrets,

48:17.535 --> 48:21.473
revealing buried corpses
in dim recesses.

48:21.506 --> 48:22.649
Corners of the mind you didn't

48:22.673 --> 48:25.243
even know existed
till you got there.

48:25.276 --> 48:30.315
Like dark hidden rooms down
below never ventured in.

48:32.316 --> 48:37.388
You go into those rooms
and it changes you.

48:37.421 --> 48:39.823
You realise that people
aren't sick.

48:39.856 --> 48:42.392
Not really.

48:42.426 --> 48:46.531
They just know things
you don't know.

48:48.765 --> 48:52.803
Did she ever talk to
you about the dark?

48:52.836 --> 48:56.240
Maybe.

49:00.510 --> 49:04.181
Your mother spoke
about the dark that day.

49:04.214 --> 49:06.850
She took me down
a room in her soul.

49:06.883 --> 49:08.586
And she showed me

49:08.618 --> 49:11.588
things about the dark that
I never, ever began to imagine.

49:11.622 --> 49:14.826
The dark she knew,

49:14.859 --> 49:19.697
she spoke about that to me.

49:19.729 --> 49:24.202
And she made it sound...

49:25.903 --> 49:29.374
She made it sound what?

49:30.441 --> 49:33.645
She made it sound wonderful.

49:35.946 --> 49:40.584
I've seen strange things, uncle.

49:40.618 --> 49:43.855
I've felt strange things.

49:43.888 --> 49:47.625
Things inside my skin
trying to get out.

49:47.658 --> 49:49.894
I know you have, Claire.

49:49.926 --> 49:53.365
Why are you still here?

49:54.966 --> 49:58.269
She keeps me here.

49:58.301 --> 50:01.205
I thought she was dead.

50:04.575 --> 50:08.413
Are you going to get that?

50:08.446 --> 50:11.249
Why don't you?

50:56.693 --> 50:59.663
Oh!

51:00.497 --> 51:02.833
Claire, you OK?

51:04.669 --> 51:09.406
Yeah, I'm fine.
What did you find out?

51:09.439 --> 51:11.809
Nothing about your father.

51:11.841 --> 51:15.579
There's no reports. Nothing
from the coroner. Nothing.

51:15.613 --> 51:17.448
It's weird.

51:17.481 --> 51:20.051
Are you sure he's dead?

51:20.084 --> 51:22.620
I'm sure.

51:22.653 --> 51:24.955
What about St Margaret's?

51:24.988 --> 51:27.724
You are right. Close.
About eight years ago.

51:27.758 --> 51:29.593
Do you know why?

51:29.627 --> 51:31.462
It's hard to tell.

51:31.495 --> 51:35.767
A few newspaper reports.
Nothing specific.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.935
There was a name mentioned
a couple of times, though.

51:37.968 --> 51:41.539
Do you know
Father Clifford Armstrong?

51:41.571 --> 51:44.642
Yes. Why?

51:44.675 --> 51:49.946
He was running the joint. Then
he disappeared. Without a trace.

51:49.979 --> 51:54.952
- The local cop...
- What about him?

51:54.984 --> 51:58.488
There is no local cop.

51:58.522 --> 52:00.825
The station shut a year ago.

52:00.857 --> 52:06.397
Hey, there's nothing
left for you, Claire.

52:06.430 --> 52:08.732
That's it.

52:08.765 --> 52:14.638
Come home. With me. Now.

52:19.377 --> 52:22.647
Will, you love me, don't you?

52:24.981 --> 52:29.586
Go home. And just wait for me.
I won't be long. I promise.

52:49.406 --> 52:52.843
- All good?
- Yep.

52:53.843 --> 52:57.615
I think we should get back.

52:57.647 --> 53:01.551
- Back where?
- St Margaret's.

53:01.584 --> 53:06.156
My father, I just want to know
what happened to him.

53:06.189 --> 53:10.627
I'm sorry, Claire.
He hung himself.

53:10.660 --> 53:13.630
When your mother was
put into my care,

53:13.664 --> 53:15.999
he felt that somehow her
troubles were his fault.

53:16.033 --> 53:18.935
And he started to fall apart.

53:18.968 --> 53:20.671
He turned his back on his god

53:20.703 --> 53:23.441
and slowly drank himself
into madness.

53:24.809 --> 53:26.977
In the end, I believe he felt

53:27.010 --> 53:29.813
she was waiting for him
somewhere in the forest.

53:31.448 --> 53:34.651
I think he wanted to join her.

53:43.727 --> 53:46.830
I'll wait here.

53:46.863 --> 53:50.033
I think this is your journey.

56:48.745 --> 56:51.915
We've been waiting for you. Shh!

56:51.948 --> 56:54.151
Listen!

56:57.687 --> 57:00.825
It's time you found out.

57:30.053 --> 57:31.955
Claire.

57:35.059 --> 57:36.727
Claire.

58:03.419 --> 58:06.758
Mum?

58:18.301 --> 58:20.405
Mum! Wait!

59:11.321 --> 59:13.790
Hello?

59:32.176 --> 59:35.113
Hello?

1:01:27.290 --> 1:01:30.227
Did you sleep well?

1:01:32.995 --> 1:01:38.001
It's true.
You've brought a gift.

1:01:44.473 --> 1:01:47.044
Everything is complete now.

1:01:47.077 --> 1:01:50.080
All of us together.

1:02:16.173 --> 1:02:17.441
What's going on?

1:02:17.473 --> 1:02:20.176
- It's Luke Dawson.
- Have you spoken to him?

1:02:20.209 --> 1:02:22.979
I tried to but he didn't
say anything.

1:02:23.013 --> 1:02:27.117
- How did he seem?
- He's a bit fucked up.

1:02:27.149 --> 1:02:29.486
I didn't know he had a gun,
though.

1:02:33.589 --> 1:02:37.060
Will, it's Luke Dawson.
And he has a gun.

1:02:39.095 --> 1:02:41.665
Hurry up, Will.

1:02:55.544 --> 1:02:57.481
Hi.

1:02:57.513 --> 1:02:59.282
How you doin', Luke?

1:02:59.316 --> 1:03:02.252
Hi, Claire. I'm fine, thanks.

1:03:02.285 --> 1:03:06.524
- Looks like rain.
- Yep.

1:03:08.325 --> 1:03:09.993
What are you doing?

1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:13.363
Nothing much. Thinking.

1:03:13.397 --> 1:03:16.066
About what?

1:03:16.098 --> 1:03:17.700
Things.

1:03:17.734 --> 1:03:20.037
OK.

1:03:20.069 --> 1:03:21.171
Thinking about going away.

1:03:21.203 --> 1:03:25.376
Oh, yeah, nice.
Ni... On a holiday?

1:03:26.376 --> 1:03:29.647
No, just away.

1:03:40.756 --> 1:03:43.059
Away where?

1:03:45.461 --> 1:03:47.764
I don't want to be here anymore.

1:03:47.798 --> 1:03:50.100
I know what you mean.

1:03:51.501 --> 1:03:53.169
Don't you want to stick around

1:03:53.202 --> 1:03:58.307
and see if you can't work it
out? Things might get better.

1:03:58.341 --> 1:04:01.377
You know you don't have
to work it out on your own.

1:04:01.410 --> 1:04:04.580
- People can help you.
- What people?

1:04:04.613 --> 1:04:08.051
Friends. Family.

1:04:08.084 --> 1:04:11.754
I don't have anyone.
They've all gone.

1:04:11.787 --> 1:04:18.261
It's OK, though. I understand
why. It's my fault, really.

1:04:19.463 --> 1:04:21.198
I take responsibility
for what happened.

1:04:21.231 --> 1:04:23.367
I don't want to be here anymore
so I'm going to leave.

1:04:23.399 --> 1:04:26.436
Is that OK?

1:04:29.638 --> 1:04:34.178
Sorry, I didn't mean to
cause any trouble.

1:04:34.211 --> 1:04:38.749
I just don't know what else
to do. Where else to go.

1:04:42.586 --> 1:04:44.455
I know what happened.

1:04:44.488 --> 1:04:45.789
Sorry?

1:04:45.821 --> 1:04:52.095
Yep. I do. Only I know.

1:04:52.129 --> 1:04:56.633
It's dreadful what
he did to you.

1:04:56.665 --> 1:05:00.236
But you know what I think?

1:05:00.269 --> 1:05:02.638
I think it WAS your fault.

1:05:02.671 --> 1:05:07.677
Come on. You know.

1:05:09.211 --> 1:05:13.449
Poor bastard didn't stand
a chance.

1:05:13.482 --> 1:05:17.787
You knew his weakness
and you prayed on it.

1:05:17.821 --> 1:05:20.857
Didn't you?

1:05:20.890 --> 1:05:22.693
I like it.

1:05:22.725 --> 1:05:25.761
- Nice work, boy.
- Please, stop.

1:05:25.794 --> 1:05:29.265
That's what he called you,
didn't he?

1:05:29.298 --> 1:05:31.834
Stop.

1:05:31.868 --> 1:05:35.839
He touched you. Good boy.

1:05:35.872 --> 1:05:38.709
Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell a soul.

1:05:38.742 --> 1:05:40.477
Please, stop.

1:05:40.510 --> 1:05:42.778
- Didn't tell anyone, did you?
- No, I didn't. I promise.

1:05:42.812 --> 1:05:45.348
And how do I know?

1:05:45.381 --> 1:05:47.818
- Do it.
- Please...

1:05:47.850 --> 1:05:52.222
For once in your life, just
get something right, boy. Do it!

1:05:52.254 --> 1:05:55.358
Do it, boy. Do it.

1:05:59.361 --> 1:06:05.202
Hi. I got your note.

1:06:07.937 --> 1:06:10.508
Excuse me.

1:06:23.819 --> 1:06:26.656
Luke, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1:06:28.425 --> 1:06:33.696
"I wanted you to know that it
wasn't me, not really me.

1:06:33.729 --> 1:06:36.199
"I know you might find this
hard to believe"

1:06:36.232 --> 1:06:37.334
"but it is the truth."

1:06:37.367 --> 1:06:41.305
"I just wanted you to know that."

1:06:43.673 --> 1:06:46.609
"I'd like you to forgive me."

1:06:47.611 --> 1:06:49.780
"For my sake."

1:06:51.281 --> 1:06:53.550
"And yours."

1:06:53.582 --> 1:06:55.885
"Claire."

1:07:02.959 --> 1:07:05.729
MY sake?

1:07:06.997 --> 1:07:10.466
Fuck! I'm dead! My sake?

1:07:14.403 --> 1:07:17.240
Got you.

1:07:17.274 --> 1:07:21.678
I'm kidding. I got you, though,
didn't I? What do you think?

1:07:21.711 --> 1:07:24.314
Convincing?

1:07:24.347 --> 1:07:26.950
I like what you did.

1:07:26.982 --> 1:07:31.455
Particularly the bit about the
'good boy' part, I liked that.

1:07:31.488 --> 1:07:32.990
That was fucking great.

1:07:33.022 --> 1:07:35.392
I think it's what really
tipped him over the edge,

1:07:35.425 --> 1:07:36.526
what do you think, yes?

1:07:36.559 --> 1:07:39.263
No? Maybe?

1:07:40.763 --> 1:07:42.332
It doesn't matter.

1:07:42.365 --> 1:07:45.535
You gave the most excellent
performance I'd ever seen.

1:07:45.568 --> 1:07:49.906
You were very, very,
very fucking good.

1:07:49.939 --> 1:07:54.645
Now, come on, seriously, "Oh,
I'm so lonely. I've got nobody."

1:07:54.678 --> 1:07:56.747
Give me a fucking break!

1:08:01.318 --> 1:08:04.488
You did very, very well.

1:08:04.521 --> 1:08:08.392
That's the part of you I want.

1:08:11.493 --> 1:08:16.033
You have your mother's eyes.
And her heart.

1:08:18.034 --> 1:08:20.638
It's true.

1:08:25.607 --> 1:08:26.976
Don't be long.

1:08:27.010 --> 1:08:30.381
I've been waiting.

1:09:46.955 --> 1:09:48.958
You came.

1:09:52.061 --> 1:09:53.864
I did.

1:09:56.165 --> 1:09:58.901
I called you.

1:10:03.573 --> 1:10:09.678
I'm so glad to see you.
I thought you were dead.

1:10:09.712 --> 1:10:11.615
I'm not dead.

1:10:11.647 --> 1:10:14.418
Let's go home.

1:10:14.450 --> 1:10:17.988
Home? I've done terrible things.

1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:21.524
None of that matters.

1:10:22.624 --> 1:10:25.128
It wasn't you, was it?

1:10:27.163 --> 1:10:31.935
I want it to end. It has to end!

1:10:31.967 --> 1:10:37.006
- It has ended.
- No, darling, it hasn't.

1:10:37.039 --> 1:10:39.909
But you can end it.

1:10:39.943 --> 1:10:43.146
You have a choice to make.

1:10:44.513 --> 1:10:47.150
Yes. It's true.

1:10:47.182 --> 1:10:51.555
She's going to be so
beautiful. I'm so proud of you.

1:10:51.587 --> 1:10:54.824
- Come on, Mum. Please.
- Stop.

1:10:54.857 --> 1:10:56.459
You don't understand.

1:10:56.493 --> 1:10:58.595
There is something
in those woods

1:10:58.628 --> 1:11:01.498
and it is waiting for you
and your child.

1:11:01.530 --> 1:11:05.534
But there is a way
and only you can do it.

1:11:05.568 --> 1:11:08.204
That's why I called you.

1:11:08.238 --> 1:11:11.807
By doing this,
you will break the line.

1:11:11.841 --> 1:11:14.711
But only the flame can do it.

1:11:14.744 --> 1:11:18.181
- Now...
- No.

1:11:18.213 --> 1:11:21.584
- I can't.
- There is no other way.

1:11:21.618 --> 1:11:22.752
Claire!

1:11:22.784 --> 1:11:26.122
- Uncle Cliff?
- Don't be fooled, Claire.

1:11:26.154 --> 1:11:28.224
Claire. Help.

1:11:33.663 --> 1:11:36.567
- Uncle Cliff?
- I'm here.

1:11:46.609 --> 1:11:48.912
Uncle Cliff?

1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:02.059
You know who I am.

1:12:03.325 --> 1:12:04.593
Yes.

1:12:04.627 --> 1:12:08.131
You know what I can do for you.

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:13.570
- What can you do?
- I can do whatever you want.

1:12:13.602 --> 1:12:17.007
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

1:12:17.039 --> 1:12:21.744
- Do you know what I want?
- What do you want?

1:12:21.778 --> 1:12:25.682
I want you. And your little one.

1:12:25.714 --> 1:12:28.651
To be happy with me forever.

1:12:28.685 --> 1:12:33.155
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

1:12:35.592 --> 1:12:37.694
The sunrise.

1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:41.964
Think of that sunrise, Claire.

1:12:41.998 --> 1:12:45.035
Think of its warmth.

1:12:46.936 --> 1:12:50.740
Are you feeling
that in your soul?

1:12:50.772 --> 1:12:53.810
Yes.

1:12:53.842 --> 1:12:56.211
Now take that feeling

1:12:56.244 --> 1:13:01.050
and that happiness
and multiply it.

1:13:01.083 --> 1:13:07.623
You can have that.
I can give it to you and more.

1:13:07.656 --> 1:13:10.627
Forever.

1:13:10.659 --> 1:13:16.098
- You won't that, that you?
- Yes.

1:13:17.333 --> 1:13:20.571
Take my hand, dear.

1:13:22.171 --> 1:13:27.811
Come. Take it. Take it.

1:13:27.843 --> 1:13:31.948
Claire, don't listen. Claire...

1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:37.219
Take it. Don't be afraid.

1:13:37.253 --> 1:13:42.659
You're right.
I know who you are.

1:13:42.691 --> 1:13:45.662
You can go to hell.

1:13:54.003 --> 1:13:56.973
We'll be waiting.

1:13:57.006 --> 1:13:58.941
Mum! Mum, let's go.

1:13:58.975 --> 1:14:00.744
- No, I'm not going anywhere.
- Mum...

1:14:00.776 --> 1:14:03.046
You stupid child,
I can't leave this place.

1:14:03.079 --> 1:14:05.749
It's too late for me.

1:14:11.721 --> 1:14:13.990
Do you know what it means?

1:14:14.022 --> 1:14:15.257
No.

1:14:15.290 --> 1:14:17.961
It means a difficult choice,
so let's make it.

1:14:17.994 --> 1:14:19.295
Mum, I can't!

1:14:19.328 --> 1:14:23.100
You can do it, darling.

1:14:46.455 --> 1:14:48.958
Goodbye, darling.

1:16:36.865 --> 1:16:38.935
Sarah...

1:16:47.976 --> 1:16:49.546
Sarah!

1:16:57.153 --> 1:16:59.556
Can we go home now?

1:16:59.588 --> 1:17:02.892
Of course we can go home, Angel.
