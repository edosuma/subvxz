CHILDREN [ chanting]
Hanson! Hanson! Hanson...!

18:52.870 --> 18:54.089
[ grunts]

18:54.176 --> 18:55.264
Hanson! Hanson!

18:55.351 --> 18:57.745
Hanson! Hanson!

18:57.832 --> 18:59.877
Hanson! Hanson!

18:59.964 --> 19:01.705
Hanson! Hanson!

19:01.792 --> 19:02.750
Hanson!

19:02.837 --> 19:04.708
Hanson! Hanson!

19:04.795 --> 19:06.188
Hanson! Hanson!

19:09.931 --> 19:11.367
Reese, what do you think
you're doing?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.803
Look,

19:12.890 --> 19:14.370
there's something
you should know.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.980
Dad's been sleepwalking
every night

19:16.067 --> 19:17.634
for the past week.

19:17.721 --> 19:18.896
He's in the kitchen
right now making me paella.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.028
What are you talking about?

19:20.115 --> 19:21.595
It's because he's stressed out

19:21.682 --> 19:23.423
about picking a present
for your anniversary.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.555
-Oh! You're kidding.
-Don't worry.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.340
Right now he'll do
anything you say,

19:27.427 --> 19:29.603
and he won't even remember
the conversation the next day.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.908
So, you can

19:30.995 --> 19:32.171
go out there
and end his suffering.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.913
He's a good man.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.046
Treat him right.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.398
Oh, and don't make him
drink out of the toilet.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.271
It's not as satisfying
as you'd think.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.711
Hal?

19:50.798 --> 19:52.147
No. Not now.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.280
Have to think.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.891
Nothing! I've got nothing!

19:56.978 --> 19:59.850
I know you've been very worried
about our anniversary.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.112
Shh!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.288
You can't find out
about this.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.246
Don't worry. I won't.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.249
Of course this is the 20th,
and that's very special.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.469
It has to be... the best!

20:09.556 --> 20:11.122
So listen very carefully.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.299
Here are the gifts
that Lois has been dreaming of.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.648
[ quiet whimper]

20:14.735 --> 20:16.911
A three-pack
of vacuum cleaner bags,

20:16.998 --> 20:19.348
a new heating pad, oh,
and some of those gel inserts

20:19.435 --> 20:21.524
for her work shoes.
Size nine.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.743
That's it!

20:22.830 --> 20:24.005
Yes! Oh!

20:24.092 --> 20:25.963
Finally. The relief.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.182
And one more thing.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.705
There's nothing you love more

20:28.792 --> 20:30.446
than changing
Jamie's poopie diapers.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.056
You got that right.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.101
[ quiet whimper]

20:35.538 --> 20:37.497
I returned the guitar.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.802
Mom was right.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.239
I don't have any
of Dewey's talent.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.501
But it's okay.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.416
I'm good at a lot
of other things.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.983
I've learned a little something
about myself, and I feel good.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.117
Ow!

20:49.204 --> 20:51.032
Vacuum cleaner bags?

20:51.119 --> 20:52.990
Hal, this is uncanny.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.036
This is exactly
what I was hoping for.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.167
How on Earth did you know?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.430
Come on, honey.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.083
When you've been married
as long we have,

20:59.170 --> 21:00.607
it's like being psychic.
I just know.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.262
Oh, man.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.655
I think Jamie has a present
for someone.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.135
I got it!

21:07.222 --> 21:08.789
Oh, I've been waiting
for this all day.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.530
Come on, buddy.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.401
[ sniffs]
Oh, yeah.

21:12.488 --> 21:13.881
[ laughs]
Yahoo!

21:13.968 --> 21:18.625
Happy anniversary, Mom.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.226
