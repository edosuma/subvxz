WEBVTT

00:05.815 --> 00:08.693
We need to contain the sickening.

00:08.776 --> 00:12.822
Dr. Graham, what's the latest
on the outbreak in Kentucky?

00:12.905 --> 00:15.241
Kentucky, Madam President?

00:15.325 --> 00:17.202
Kentucky is gone.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.580
The sickening, it got them all.

00:20.663 --> 00:23.833
Has there been any progress on the cure?

00:23.916 --> 00:26.085
I have my best technicians
analyzing the samples

00:26.169 --> 00:27.795
as we speak.

00:27.879 --> 00:29.297
All right.

00:29.381 --> 00:31.383
Let's add 50 milligrams
of the iGG solution.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.009
Right away, Dr. Vincent.

00:34.844 --> 00:36.262
Solution is stable.

00:36.346 --> 00:37.263
It's game time.

00:37.347 --> 00:38.473
Let's add the virus.

00:38.557 --> 00:40.016
Where did you obtain the sample?

00:40.099 --> 00:41.518
Found it off some monkey
at the Memphis Zoo.

00:41.601 --> 00:43.102
It's the latest strain.

00:46.189 --> 00:51.486
♪ ♪

00:51.570 --> 00:54.780
Virus, party of one, your table is ready.

00:54.864 --> 00:56.408
Careful.

00:57.242 --> 00:59.160
Easy.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.499
Solution is nonreactive.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.459
Antibodies are stable.

01:06.543 --> 01:08.503
Madam President, we have a cure.

01:08.587 --> 01:10.046
Oh, thank God.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.047
Outstanding.

01:12.798 --> 01:13.799
You did it, Doctor.

01:13.883 --> 01:16.052
It was a team effort, Terry.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.180
What the fuck is happening?

01:19.264 --> 01:20.723
Oh, God. The virus is mutating!

01:20.806 --> 01:22.308
- How did it adapt so quickly?
- I don't know.

01:22.392 --> 01:23.518
We got to get the fuck out of here!

01:23.602 --> 01:25.186
Put the sample back in storage!

01:26.271 --> 01:27.230
Oh, shit. Fuck.

01:27.313 --> 01:28.565
Activate containment protocol!

01:34.404 --> 01:36.197
I don't want to die!

01:36.281 --> 01:38.116
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

01:38.199 --> 01:39.784
Get the president out of here!

01:39.867 --> 01:41.869
Get her out of here now!
God damn it, now!

01:43.622 --> 01:44.830
The sickening!

01:44.914 --> 01:46.999
It's happening!

01:47.083 --> 01:48.751
It's gonna kill us all!

01:50.295 --> 01:51.337
Cut.

01:51.421 --> 01:53.756
- That's a cut.
- Cut!

01:53.839 --> 01:56.217
That was mayhem.

01:56.301 --> 01:58.928
All right,
let's break for a soft 15, okay?

01:59.011 --> 02:01.139
- Back in 15.
- Soft 15, folks.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.765
So this is your first movie, huh?

02:02.848 --> 02:04.559
Yeah. Pretty crazy story.

02:04.643 --> 02:07.312
I auditioned, and I got a callback.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.606
And then they said
they cast this other guy.

02:09.689 --> 02:11.274
And then the other guy dropped out.

02:11.357 --> 02:13.776
And then they called me back again,
and I got it.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.571
That's a pretty boring story.

02:16.655 --> 02:18.864
I wouldn't tell that to anyone else.

02:18.948 --> 02:22.452
Yeah, I could feel it
going south as I was saying it.

02:22.535 --> 02:24.996
Wow. It's a pretty crazy set.

02:25.121 --> 02:26.581
Yeah. This is a huge movie.

02:26.665 --> 02:28.082
It's a great gig.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.375
I didn't have this kind of spread

02:29.459 --> 02:30.960
on the set of The Cookout.

02:31.043 --> 02:32.253
What?

02:32.337 --> 02:33.921
I knew I recognized you!

02:34.005 --> 02:35.298
You were the white guy
that fell into the grill.

02:35.381 --> 02:36.757
You ruined Marquise's barbecue.

02:36.841 --> 02:38.009
I did. I ruined it.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.594
Hold on.

02:39.678 --> 02:42.888
Were you also in Soul Plane 3:
This Is How We Flew It?

02:42.972 --> 02:43.931
Maybe.

02:44.015 --> 02:45.266
Does this ring a bell?

02:45.350 --> 02:47.101
I told you, no twerking during takeoff!

02:47.185 --> 02:48.269
That's a classic line.

02:48.353 --> 02:49.854
You know what?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.189
I improvised that line.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.066
Ooh. Nice tidbit.

02:54.150 --> 02:55.610
You know another tidbit?

02:56.819 --> 02:59.698
Taye Diggs? He hates celery.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.951
But I love it.

03:06.037 --> 03:07.038
Hey, Brian,

03:07.121 --> 03:09.248
you want to go see
Father John Misty on Saturday?

03:09.332 --> 03:10.542
The secret show?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.335
Yes. How'd you swing that?

03:12.418 --> 03:13.919
Um, my friend Dave had tickets,

03:14.003 --> 03:15.254
and then he got kidney stones,

03:15.338 --> 03:16.255
and he can't go.

03:16.339 --> 03:17.632
Oh, damn. Is he okay?

03:17.716 --> 03:18.758
Um, I don't know.

03:18.841 --> 03:19.800
I forgot to ask.

03:19.884 --> 03:22.512
I just printed the tickets
and got psyched for the show.

03:22.595 --> 03:24.930
Bro, you cannot take Brian, man.

03:25.014 --> 03:26.558
It's gonna be an amazing show.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.351
You got a hot ticket,
you bring a hot lady.

03:28.434 --> 03:29.686
Mm, he's right. Sorry, Brian.

03:29.769 --> 03:30.811
You're not invited anymore.

03:30.895 --> 03:32.522
Cool. Thanks, Arnold.

03:32.605 --> 03:34.023
No problem, buddy.

03:34.106 --> 03:36.150
Let's see.

03:36.234 --> 03:37.485
There's this girl Anna

03:37.569 --> 03:39.445
I met at the Cabin Bar a few weeks ago.

03:39.529 --> 03:42.156
Um, in the description, I put "headband."

03:42.240 --> 03:43.408
She must've been wearing one.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.992
And there's this other girl

03:45.076 --> 03:46.786
I met at my friend Zach's birthday party

03:46.869 --> 03:48.496
who writes for The New York Times.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.373
So between girl with the headband

03:50.456 --> 03:51.624
and journalist?

03:51.708 --> 03:53.209
I'ma go with the journalist.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.670
Dude, it's a Father John Misty show.

03:55.754 --> 03:57.589
There's gonna be white people everywhere.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.716
Bring an Asian guy
in case you need backup

03:59.799 --> 04:01.050
when the race war goes down.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.968
If the race war goes down

04:03.052 --> 04:05.555
and I'm at a Father John Misty
show, I'm already fudged.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.306
You guys need anything?

04:07.390 --> 04:08.683
Um, no.

04:08.767 --> 04:09.684
I think we're all good, Alice.

04:09.768 --> 04:10.685
Thanks.

04:10.769 --> 04:11.936
Okay, I'm closing out.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.730
But James can help you
if you need anything.

04:13.813 --> 04:16.107
Oh, my God, I love those shoes.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.776
Oh, my God, just bought these guys.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.485
Thanks for the compliment,
reaffirmed the purchase.

04:19.569 --> 04:20.653
- Oh.
- Thanks so much.

04:20.737 --> 04:22.614
Okay.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.323
Dude, forget that journalist.

04:24.407 --> 04:26.200
Take Alice. She's smoking hot.

04:26.284 --> 04:28.244
Plus she's vibing on those slips, brah.

04:28.327 --> 04:29.788
Oh, come on.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.414
I can't ask Alice out. She's so hot.

04:31.497 --> 04:32.957
She's like at the level of hot,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.584
if I'm seen with her, people would assume

04:34.667 --> 04:35.876
I'm an Indian billionaire.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.169
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

04:37.253 --> 04:38.588
But for this one night only,

04:38.671 --> 04:40.465
because you have that sick ticket,

04:40.548 --> 04:42.049
you get a guest pass in her league.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.968
But if you bring
someone you don't know,

04:44.051 --> 04:47.555
then you're running the risk
that she's just using you for that tickie.

04:47.639 --> 04:49.974
Dude, getting used
by a hottie like that

04:50.057 --> 04:52.101
is way better than bringing Brian.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.061
At this point,
I just don't want you to bring Brian.

04:54.145 --> 04:56.689
Dude, why are you doing this?

04:56.773 --> 04:58.190
I'm sorry, man.

04:58.274 --> 05:01.277
Listen, next week, you and me, aquarium.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.028
Are you s--
I love the aquarium.

05:03.112 --> 05:04.322
- That--
- I know.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.157
And they have new manta rays there.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.617
You're the best, man.
You're the best.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.452
You're the best, dude.

05:09.535 --> 05:10.829
All right.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.871
I'll ask out Alice.

05:11.996 --> 05:13.372
Hopefully she says yes.

05:13.456 --> 05:14.499
We go to the concert.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.875
She sees my inner beauty.

05:15.958 --> 05:17.084
And we create a little

05:17.168 --> 05:19.170
"He's" All That scenario.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.339
So just to recap,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.424
you're gonna ask the most attractive girl?

05:23.508 --> 05:24.509
Yes.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.552
Interesting turn of events.

05:26.636 --> 05:28.095
Isn't it?

05:30.264 --> 05:31.557
Hey, Alice.

05:31.641 --> 05:32.558
Hi.

05:32.642 --> 05:33.685
Do you need something else?

05:33.768 --> 05:34.769
Uh, no.

05:34.853 --> 05:37.104
I was actually wondering--
I have two tickets

05:37.188 --> 05:40.399
to that secret Father John Misty
show on Saturday.

05:40.483 --> 05:42.109
Would you want to go?

05:42.193 --> 05:43.903
Yes.

05:43.986 --> 05:45.279
Oh, my God, yeah.

05:45.363 --> 05:47.031
To-- Yeah, to be clear, with me.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.574
Not, like, Emilio Estevez or something.

05:48.658 --> 05:49.950
I know. I know.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.577
- No, that sounds amazing.
- All right.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.454
Yeah, I just-- I have
to check my work schedule.

05:53.538 --> 05:55.289
All right, do you want to
write your number down

05:55.373 --> 05:57.416
- and I can text you and figure it out?
- Yeah.

05:58.209 --> 05:59.293
Cool.

06:01.838 --> 06:03.548
Okay.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.424
- There you go.
- Great.

06:05.508 --> 06:06.676
All right.

06:06.759 --> 06:08.761
Well, uh...

06:08.845 --> 06:11.430
guess that's the end of this interaction.

06:11.514 --> 06:13.725
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:21.065 --> 06:25.820
♪ ♪

07:02.899 --> 07:05.067
Wow, The Sickening makeup is crazy.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.611
I'm gonna look like this?

07:06.694 --> 07:10.364
Yep, but it'll take a few hours.
We're gonna start with your arms.

07:10.448 --> 07:12.283
Now, you're gonna have
to keep your arms still

07:12.366 --> 07:13.534
for the entire session.

07:13.618 --> 07:14.994
You need to do anything?

07:15.077 --> 07:16.871
- You all good?
- Yeah, I'm all good.

07:16.996 --> 07:19.540
You sure?
Once they start, you can't move.

07:19.624 --> 07:20.583
All right.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.042
One second.

07:22.752 --> 07:23.669
I'm good.

07:23.753 --> 07:24.670
Okay. Sweet.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.343
Hey, Benjamin,
you mind checking that text for me?

07:31.427 --> 07:32.762
What, you got a hot date?

07:32.845 --> 07:34.054
I hope so.

07:35.347 --> 07:36.307
All right.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.392
Thank you.

07:38.476 --> 07:39.894
Is your hot date named Brian?

07:39.978 --> 07:41.687
Ugh, no.

07:41.771 --> 07:45.775
He says, "About to try new
ramen place, you interested?"

07:45.858 --> 07:47.777
You can just write back, "No."

07:47.860 --> 07:51.322
Just, "No"?
That's incredibly rude.

07:51.405 --> 07:56.327
I'm gonna write back,
"Sorry, just ate.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.871
But I really admire you as a person."

07:58.955 --> 08:00.039
Come on, just-- Don't do that.

08:00.164 --> 08:02.333
Just write, "No."

08:02.416 --> 08:03.417
I just did that.

08:03.501 --> 08:04.418
What I said.

08:04.502 --> 08:05.419
Yeah.

08:05.503 --> 08:06.712
I sent it.

08:12.635 --> 08:13.552
Can you check that?

08:13.636 --> 08:15.220
Mm-hmm.

08:15.304 --> 08:17.015
Oh, he wrote back.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.433
"Thanks, buddy. That means a lot.

08:19.517 --> 08:21.936
I admire you, too."

08:22.020 --> 08:23.604
Fair enough, all right.

08:23.688 --> 08:25.314
Guess I'll try to be nicer in my texts.

08:25.397 --> 08:27.191
Mm-hmm, I think you should.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.860
Brian appreciated it.

08:33.739 --> 08:34.824
Hey, you mind checking that?

08:34.907 --> 08:36.784
- Really?
- Come on.

08:38.786 --> 08:39.996
- Brian again.
- Damn it.

08:40.079 --> 08:42.164
"Ramen place is pretty good, B-plus."

08:42.247 --> 08:44.959
I feel like this one doesn't
require a thoughtful response.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.044
No.

08:50.882 --> 08:52.216
Come on. Do it.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.551
Check it. Come on, man.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.552
It can't be Brian.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.055
Wow. Wow.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.097
Brian.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.016
What the fuck does he want?

09:00.099 --> 09:02.351
"Feeling a kitten gross.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.979
Downgrading to a B-minus."

09:07.106 --> 09:09.608
"Little gross, not kitten gross."

09:11.402 --> 09:12.319
"Autocorrect."

09:12.403 --> 09:13.362
Great.

09:15.948 --> 09:17.408
It's been two days, dude.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.617
I haven't heard anything from Alice.

09:18.701 --> 09:19.827
What's wrong with people?

09:19.911 --> 09:21.620
Look, Alice is a worldly woman

09:21.746 --> 09:22.621
living in the big city.

09:22.747 --> 09:23.748
Maybe she's just busy.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.290
Mm, she's not that busy.

09:25.374 --> 09:27.085
I did a little snooping on her Instagram.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.293
Nice.

09:28.377 --> 09:31.839
She recently posted a video
of her popping bubble wrap.

09:31.923 --> 09:33.966
Caption, "I love bubble wrap."

09:34.050 --> 09:35.634
Fifty-four likes.

09:35.718 --> 09:37.177
That sneaky bitch.

09:37.261 --> 09:39.055
What about this?

09:39.138 --> 09:40.973
Ladies like honesty, right?

09:41.057 --> 09:42.975
What if I'm just super honest?

09:43.059 --> 09:44.060
What if I'm just like,

09:44.143 --> 09:46.520
"Hey, Alice, what the fuck?

09:46.604 --> 09:48.439
It's been two days. I'm waiting.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.732
What, are you in a mine shaft?

09:49.815 --> 09:50.942
Let me know about that concert."

09:51.025 --> 09:52.443
It'd be different.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.612
It-- Very hard for me
to imagine a situation

09:54.695 --> 09:56.948
where she reads that
and she has a positive reaction.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.240
Why don't you just do what I do?

09:58.323 --> 10:00.534
Just send her a question mark.

10:00.618 --> 10:02.161
Like, just a question mark?

10:02.244 --> 10:03.412
Yep. That's it.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.872
It's like a light check-in.

10:04.956 --> 10:07.041
Nah, buddy, here's the move.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.834
You send her a picture of a turtle

10:08.918 --> 10:10.753
climbing out of a briefcase.

10:10.836 --> 10:13.756
Then quickly write,
"Whoops, sorry, wrong person."

10:13.839 --> 10:16.134
You'll get an instant response
back from her.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.678
It's mysterious,
and girls love mystery, brah.

10:19.762 --> 10:22.140
I don't know,
it might be a little risky for Alice.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.433
Don't be too quick to dismiss that turtle.

10:24.516 --> 10:26.894
Everyone wants to know what he's up to.

10:26.978 --> 10:27.979
Denise!

10:28.062 --> 10:29.688
What up, dummies?

10:29.772 --> 10:31.899
We're debating what I should do

10:31.983 --> 10:34.234
about this whole Alice situation,
you know?

10:34.318 --> 10:35.987
I texted her about her schedule.
It's been two days.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.321
I haven't heard anything back.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.948
So she doesn't like you.

10:39.031 --> 10:39.949
What's the debate?

10:40.032 --> 10:40.950
I'm confused.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.160
Hey!

10:42.242 --> 10:43.619
Why you got to be so pessimistic?

10:43.702 --> 10:44.912
Dude, she ain't text you in two days,

10:44.996 --> 10:46.455
it means she don't want to go.

10:46.538 --> 10:48.791
This is a very clear
and unambiguous situation.

10:48.874 --> 10:53.045
Or-- Or maybe she really
likes me and she's nervous.

10:53.129 --> 10:55.214
And she's sitting around
with three of her buds

10:55.297 --> 10:57.675
trying to figure out
what to text this guy.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.593
What about that scenario?

10:59.677 --> 11:00.803
No.

11:00.886 --> 11:03.055
She doesn't like you, man.

11:03.139 --> 11:05.057
Why you got to crush my dreams?

11:05.141 --> 11:07.518
I think I'm just gonna
send a little question mark.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.311
Question mark?

11:09.394 --> 11:10.604
Did Brian tell you to do that?

11:10.688 --> 11:12.106
Yeah.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.399
I told you,
stop taking advice from him, dude.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.485
Look, it don't matter
what he texts these girls.

11:16.568 --> 11:17.987
All girls like his ass.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.989
It's true.

11:20.072 --> 11:21.532
It's just a light check-in.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.242
Just like, "Oh?"

11:23.325 --> 11:24.326
No.

11:24.409 --> 11:25.744
When he does it, it's cute.

11:25.828 --> 11:28.706
If you do it, it's needy and sad.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.166
Well, now I already sent it.

11:30.249 --> 11:32.126
Thanks for your timely advice.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.253
Denise, a query.

11:34.336 --> 11:36.463
What if someone sent you
a picture of a turtle

11:36.547 --> 11:38.340
climbing out of a briefcase?

11:38.423 --> 11:41.760
Why is a turtle climbing
out of a briefcase, Arnold?

11:41.844 --> 11:43.054
"Why?" indeed.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.516
So you heard from your lady?

11:47.599 --> 11:48.976
No, nothing.

11:49.060 --> 11:50.728
The show's tomorrow.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.022
Fuck that person.
She seems so rude.

11:53.105 --> 11:55.649
Oh, I 100% agree.
It's totally rude.

11:55.733 --> 11:58.485
But that's just the way
people act nowadays.

11:58.569 --> 12:00.196
What do you mean?

12:00.279 --> 12:03.157
Um, here's a text message exchange

12:03.241 --> 12:05.450
I had with a girl
that I met a few months ago.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.829
All right.

12:08.954 --> 12:11.665
"Hey, it's Dev. Good meeting you."

12:11.749 --> 12:12.917
"You too!"

12:13.000 --> 12:14.043
"Grab a drink soon?"

12:14.126 --> 12:15.502
"Yeah, how about Wednesday?"

12:15.586 --> 12:17.629
"Can't Wednesday, maybe Friday?"

12:17.713 --> 12:18.630
"Sure!"

12:18.714 --> 12:19.673
"Hey, it's Friday.

12:19.757 --> 12:21.466
Should we grab those drinks?"

12:21.550 --> 12:22.927
I never heard from this person again.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.304
Wow. I hated all of that.

12:25.387 --> 12:28.390
You want to hear a sample
of texts between me and my wife?

12:28.473 --> 12:30.059
"You want to stay in tonight?"

12:30.142 --> 12:31.435
"Yes."

12:31.518 --> 12:33.312
Fucking paradise.

12:33.395 --> 12:35.647
I've never been so jealous of something
that sounds so boring.

12:35.731 --> 12:36.815
I love it.

12:36.899 --> 12:38.859
You know, after work,
I'm gonna go home,

12:38.943 --> 12:41.820
cuddle up with my loving wife
and watch three to five hours

12:41.904 --> 12:45.490
of a critically acclaimed drama,
and then go to sleep.

12:45.574 --> 12:46.491
It's amazing.

12:46.575 --> 12:47.868
What are you guys watching?

12:47.952 --> 12:49.036
Oh, this British show, Sherlock.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.163
- I highly recommend it.
- Hmm.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.626
Oh, shit, it's Alice!

12:59.004 --> 13:00.256
Seriously?

13:01.132 --> 13:03.383
"Sorry, things have been really crazy.

13:03.467 --> 13:04.718
Don't think I can make it tomorrow.

13:04.802 --> 13:07.305
Thanks anyway, XOXO."

13:07.387 --> 13:08.889
Fuck!

13:08.973 --> 13:10.599
XOXO, that's good.

13:10.682 --> 13:11.892
It means hugs and kisses.

13:11.976 --> 13:13.185
No.

13:13.269 --> 13:16.314
"XOXO" means, "Go fuck yourself."

13:16.396 --> 13:17.898
Hmm.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.399
Well, if that's true, then all the letters

13:19.483 --> 13:21.777
my grandmother wrote me ended with,

13:21.860 --> 13:25.114
"Go fuck yourself. Grandma."

13:25.197 --> 13:27.074
Can you believe this, man?

13:27.158 --> 13:28.200
I had three days.

13:28.284 --> 13:30.244
She killed all my days.

13:30.328 --> 13:31.787
Why are people so rude?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.205
I'm a person.

13:33.289 --> 13:34.206
I'm not just a bubble in a phone.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.707
Let's just be nice.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.084
I asked this girl out a few weeks ago.

13:37.168 --> 13:38.294
She said nothing.

13:38.377 --> 13:39.586
They give you silence. Why?

13:39.670 --> 13:41.546
Make some shit up! You know?

13:41.630 --> 13:43.632
Uh, "I'm going to buy
an air conditioner."

13:43.715 --> 13:46.426
Uh, "Just put a stew on,
might be a few hours."

13:46.510 --> 13:49.096
"Got struck by lightning
while holding hands with a 12-year-old.

13:49.180 --> 13:51.056
We switched bodies.
Now I got to go to class."

13:51.140 --> 13:52.557
That'd be great!

13:52.641 --> 13:54.476
Gets the message across. No one's hurt.

13:54.559 --> 13:56.937
Yeah, but here's why you got
to silence these fools, though.

13:57.021 --> 13:58.605
Some people don't understand

13:58.689 --> 14:00.358
the "'I'm busy' three times
means no" code.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.151
Look, I met this girl Michelle, right?

14:02.234 --> 14:03.861
Was not into her.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.863
So I gave her a few, you know,
polite, busy excuses.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.115
- Mm-hmm.
- Then this happened.

14:08.199 --> 14:09.574
Hey, Denise,

14:09.658 --> 14:12.328
it's Michelle, AKA Princess Love.

14:12.411 --> 14:14.746
Got your text. You're busy.
It's cool.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.874
But do you like
haunted houses?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.626
My brother's a bouncer at one,
and he can totally hook us up.

14:19.710 --> 14:22.338
Wait, her brother's a bouncer
at a haunted house?

14:22.421 --> 14:25.465
What happens, sometimes
the ghouls act up or something?

14:25.549 --> 14:27.968
Wow, Denise, you are a busy lady.

14:28.052 --> 14:29.887
But I'm gonna keep calling.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.014
It's Princess Love.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.475
Princess Love here!

14:35.559 --> 14:38.562
Sorry you couldn't make it
to my niece's slam poetry show.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.439
But look, come out this afternoon.

14:40.522 --> 14:42.441
I'm shopping for towels.

14:42.524 --> 14:46.528
Princess Love, AKA Lil' Funyuns.

14:47.779 --> 14:49.656
Now she has another nickname?
Lil' Funyuns?

14:49.740 --> 14:51.658
Yo, I think I know this girl.

14:51.742 --> 14:54.453
She DJs at my massage class
sometimes and she plays

14:54.536 --> 14:57.456
a cool mix of Eastern and chill wave.

14:57.539 --> 14:59.166
And she's definitely little.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.960
And she definitely loves those Funyuns.

15:02.044 --> 15:03.545
That's why you don't engage.

15:03.628 --> 15:04.755
I mean, I get that.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.715
But look, I ain't Lil' Funyuns.

15:06.798 --> 15:08.008
I ain't Princess Love.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.634
I'm nice guy, Dev.

15:09.718 --> 15:10.928
And this concert's tomorrow.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.012
Who am I gonna take?

15:12.096 --> 15:13.680
Dev, here's what you do.

15:13.764 --> 15:15.807
You just--
If there's any girls that you like,

15:15.891 --> 15:17.226
you just invite them to the concert,

15:17.309 --> 15:19.186
and whoever says yes, you take her.

15:19.270 --> 15:20.729
But what if two people say yes, Brian?

15:20.812 --> 15:22.106
What do I do then?

15:22.189 --> 15:23.148
Then I don't know.

15:23.232 --> 15:24.191
You tell the second one,

15:24.275 --> 15:25.525
"Sorry, ticket got taken."

15:25.609 --> 15:26.860
I do it all the time.

15:26.944 --> 15:28.070
Everybody likes me.

15:28.153 --> 15:30.155
No one gets hurt. No one gets mad.

15:30.239 --> 15:31.156
All right.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.368
So I'll ask Journalist,

15:34.452 --> 15:36.078
I'll ask Headband,

15:36.161 --> 15:37.329
and I'll ask this girl Sarah

15:37.413 --> 15:38.914
that I met at the Jane Hotel once.

15:38.997 --> 15:40.082
Wow, Dev.

15:40.165 --> 15:42.751
It's as if all these women
are just bubbles on your phone.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.002
That hits deep.

15:44.086 --> 15:45.754
- You got me, Denise.
- Mm-hmm.

15:45.837 --> 15:48.006
I've become the thing I hated the most.

15:48.090 --> 15:50.759
And the texts are off.

15:50.842 --> 15:52.219
All right.

15:52.303 --> 15:54.388
Sherlock, season one, episode one.

15:54.472 --> 15:55.889
Let's do this.

15:55.973 --> 15:59.518
Center seat,
make some room, coming in.

15:59.601 --> 16:01.603
Nicotine patch.

16:01.686 --> 16:03.647
Helps me think.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.565
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit

16:05.649 --> 16:07.109
in London these days.

16:07.192 --> 16:09.694
I feel like this is my new favorite show.

16:09.778 --> 16:11.571
You say that about every show.

16:11.655 --> 16:13.657
Last week, your favorite show
was Chopped.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.409
Because Chopped is amazing!

16:15.493 --> 16:17.453
I mean, right now,
actually, all shows are amazing.

16:17.536 --> 16:19.037
It's the golden age of television.

16:19.121 --> 16:21.915
Dudes, can we please
not talk during the show?

16:21.999 --> 16:23.667
Respect my Cumberbatch!

16:25.002 --> 16:26.044
Sorry.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.839
Um...

16:28.922 --> 16:32.009
Oh, Headband says,
"Cool if my brother comes?"

16:32.092 --> 16:34.136
No, Headband, why would that be cool?

16:34.219 --> 16:35.679
Sorry, ticket got taken.

16:43.395 --> 16:45.189
Was I right?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.358
Dude, I could watch Benedict Cumberbatch

16:47.441 --> 16:48.775
do anything.

16:48.859 --> 16:50.735
For real, he could play someone in a coma,

16:50.819 --> 16:52.279
just sat there, not moving.

16:52.363 --> 16:54.156
I'd still be down.

16:57.576 --> 16:59.744
One sec.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.497
Laura, AKA Journalist, says,

17:01.580 --> 17:03.207
"Hey, Dev, Would love to go.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.959
But just to be up front,
it'd have to be as friends."

17:06.043 --> 17:07.545
See? That's classy.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.880
Honesty, I respect that.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.256
So you're gonna take her as a friend?

17:11.340 --> 17:12.424
No.

17:12.508 --> 17:15.010
Sorry. Ticket got taken.

17:19.014 --> 17:22.142
Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

17:24.562 --> 17:26.730
- Aw.
- Aw, come on, man.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.357
Sarah, girl from Jane, says,

17:28.440 --> 17:29.858
"Yes, would love to go!

17:29.941 --> 17:31.693
So excited.
Let me know where to meet you."

17:31.776 --> 17:33.362
I did it!

17:33.445 --> 17:35.113
Congratulations.

17:35.197 --> 17:36.865
You found a girl in a city
of nine million people

17:36.948 --> 17:38.867
who's willing to go
to a free concert with your ass.

17:38.950 --> 17:40.411
Hit Play, man.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.746
Are you guys having
a hard time with these accents?

17:42.829 --> 17:45.665
I haven't understood
a single word of this entire show.

17:45.749 --> 17:47.125
I'm loving the visuals, but I'm like,

17:47.209 --> 17:48.419
"What's that, 'Batch?"

17:50.504 --> 17:51.422
Negroni.

17:51.505 --> 17:52.964
Ah, grazie, hombre.

17:53.048 --> 17:55.842
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Mmm.

17:55.926 --> 17:57.636
You know what I was
thinking about the other day?

17:57.719 --> 17:59.388
If I played pool all the time
for, like, three months,

17:59.471 --> 18:00.889
I think I could be a pool shark.

18:00.972 --> 18:02.600
Like, how good you got to be
to get to shark status?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.101
And then the whole
pretending to be bad?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.769
I mean, that I can do really well.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.145
Dude, same with bowling.

18:07.229 --> 18:08.564
If I bowled every night for a month,

18:08.647 --> 18:10.857
I would be on that nonstop strike status.

18:10.941 --> 18:12.610
Yeah, pro bowlers are just people

18:12.692 --> 18:14.319
that practice bowling all the time.

18:14.403 --> 18:16.821
I guess what we're saying is,
if you do something long enough,

18:16.905 --> 18:18.031
you're gonna be good at it.

18:18.115 --> 18:19.908
Mm, yeah.

18:19.991 --> 18:22.327
This conversation isn't that insightful.

18:23.454 --> 18:26.457
Ooh, who's this?

18:26.540 --> 18:27.749
It's Alice.

18:27.832 --> 18:29.460
She said her work schedule changed.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.794
She can go to the concert tonight.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.170
Fuck!

18:32.254 --> 18:33.713
Dude, you cancel on that other girl.

18:33.797 --> 18:34.714
No, I can't do that.

18:34.798 --> 18:36.049
That's rude.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.676
Bro, that ticket is some VIP shit.

18:37.759 --> 18:39.177
You take Alice.

18:39.261 --> 18:41.096
Take the other girl
to boba tea next week.

18:41.179 --> 18:43.890
Ah, it's pretty rude to flake, man.

18:43.974 --> 18:45.309
Bro, listen to me.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.102
How many times
have girls flaked on you?

18:47.185 --> 18:49.563
Think about all that
emotional stress they caused.

18:49.647 --> 18:51.022
Mm.

18:51.106 --> 18:52.608
- I'm hearing what you're saying.
- Huh?

18:52.691 --> 18:54.526
It's starting to make a lot of sense.

18:54.610 --> 18:57.195
Eh, maybe I've been looking
at this from the wrong angle.

18:57.279 --> 18:58.280
You know?

18:58.363 --> 18:59.531
Yeah. I mean, whatever.

18:59.615 --> 19:00.574
We can be shitty to people now,

19:00.658 --> 19:01.825
and it's accepted.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.619
It's one of the great things
about being alive today.

19:03.702 --> 19:04.620
I'm taking Alice.

19:04.703 --> 19:05.579
I'm so proud of you.

19:05.704 --> 19:06.622
- Come here!
- Yeah!

19:07.706 --> 19:08.999
Whoo!

19:13.044 --> 19:15.380
- Hey, what's up, Alice?
- Hi.

19:15.464 --> 19:16.881
- How are you?
- Good.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.676
So slight change of plans.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.177
Um, Father John Misty canceled.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.470
It's now Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.

19:21.553 --> 19:22.471
I hope that's okay.

19:22.554 --> 19:23.514
Oh, no, yeah.

19:23.597 --> 19:24.806
I hope they do Crossroads.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.391
Uh, should we go in?

19:26.475 --> 19:27.726
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.

19:30.187 --> 19:32.481
So, uh, how long you been at Delmano?

19:32.564 --> 19:34.065
About three years.

19:34.149 --> 19:35.066
Ah, cool.

19:35.150 --> 19:36.067
And what do you do again?

19:36.151 --> 19:37.861
Uh, actor, right?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.113
Uh, yeah. Mostly commercials.

19:40.197 --> 19:42.949
I swear I heard your voice once

19:43.033 --> 19:46.870
at the end of one of those,
uh, fast-food commercials.

19:46.995 --> 19:48.455
Am I wrong?

19:48.539 --> 19:49.831
I don't know. Were you?

19:49.914 --> 19:51.833
Wendy's. It just tastes right.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.002
Oh, my God!

19:54.085 --> 19:55.295
- That was you.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.214
Oh, that's great.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.798
Yeah, um, should we grab some drinks?

19:58.882 --> 20:00.008
No, no, you got the tickets.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.092
Let me grab these.

20:01.176 --> 20:02.386
No, no, come on, please--

20:02.469 --> 20:04.763
No, no, no,
you will respect my authority!

20:06.431 --> 20:08.308
Oh, is Cartman in the mix?

20:08.392 --> 20:10.394
But, Mom!

20:11.936 --> 20:13.146
Do you like South Park?

20:13.230 --> 20:15.148
Uh, yeah, it's a funny show.

20:15.232 --> 20:16.316
What can I get you?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.318
Cheesy poofs!

20:18.402 --> 20:20.028
No, I'm just kidding.
Can I get two beers?

20:20.111 --> 20:21.029
You got it.

20:24.575 --> 20:25.492
Do you like to travel?

20:25.576 --> 20:26.826
Uh, yeah.

20:26.910 --> 20:28.036
I went to Montreal not too long ago.

20:28.119 --> 20:28.995
Have you ever been there?

20:29.079 --> 20:30.038
Yeah, I love that place.

20:30.121 --> 20:31.790
Like, the best food.

20:31.873 --> 20:33.584
And it feels like you're in Europe.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.085
It's so fun.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.796
Oh, can you take a Vine of me real quick?

20:37.879 --> 20:39.590
Uh, sure.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.175
Uh, all right, yeah, got
the whole stage and everything.

20:42.259 --> 20:43.301
Ready?

20:43.385 --> 20:44.678
And go.

20:44.762 --> 20:45.804
What up, world?

20:45.887 --> 20:47.472
It's me, Alice.

20:47.556 --> 20:50.183
I'm here at the super secret
Father John Misty show.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.976
Whoo!

20:52.060 --> 20:53.604
- Mm.
- All right.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.397
Let me do one more.
Let me do a silly one.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.649
All right, a silly one.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.317
And action.

20:59.401 --> 21:00.736
Hello, governor.

21:00.819 --> 21:02.028
It's me, Alice.

21:02.112 --> 21:04.114
I'm at the Father John Misty show.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.700
Whoo! Miami!

21:06.784 --> 21:09.202
Well, um, got that one as well.

21:09.286 --> 21:10.161
Great.

21:10.287 --> 21:11.830
Why'd you yell, "Miami"?

21:11.913 --> 21:13.915
Um, it's an inside joke
with me and my girls

21:13.998 --> 21:14.999
from our Miami trip.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.042
Oh.

21:16.126 --> 21:17.168
You guys just went to Miami

21:17.252 --> 21:18.336
and yelled, "Miami," a bunch?

21:18.420 --> 21:19.463
Yeah. It was hysterical.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.464
All right, ready?

21:20.547 --> 21:22.006
Quick game, quick game.

21:22.090 --> 21:23.300
If you could live anywhere in the world,

21:23.383 --> 21:24.301
where would you live?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.302
Go!

21:25.385 --> 21:28.096
And five and six and seven
and eight and one and two--

21:28.179 --> 21:29.097
Uh, Italy?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.098
Yes! Easy.

21:30.181 --> 21:31.600
"Alice, where would you live?"

21:31.683 --> 21:33.059
Mars, no question.
You can breathe there now.

21:33.143 --> 21:34.060
What?

21:37.606 --> 21:41.025
♪ ♪

21:47.282 --> 21:49.367
How crazy would it be

21:49.451 --> 21:52.162
if I just started sucking
that guy's dick over there?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.249
Yeah.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.375
That'd be pretty nuts.

21:57.459 --> 22:00.170
Oh! What would you do?

22:00.253 --> 22:01.087
I don't know.

22:01.171 --> 22:02.798
I would probably be like,

22:02.881 --> 22:05.634
"Hey, Alice,
why are you sucking a stranger's dick

22:05.717 --> 22:07.260
in a public place?"

22:07.344 --> 22:10.430
Yeah, and then-- And then
I'd be all like, "Huh?"

22:13.933 --> 22:15.560
Oh, hey.

22:15.644 --> 22:16.812
Hey.

22:16.895 --> 22:18.897
Look at that jacket over there.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.858
You dare me to steal it?

22:20.940 --> 22:21.983
No.

22:22.066 --> 22:23.360
Don't do that?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.986
But it's a cool jacket.

22:25.069 --> 22:26.446
And I want it.

22:26.530 --> 22:29.533
And people lose jackets
at shows all the time.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.284
Mm, I'm just gonna take it.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.168
Are you really just gonna take that?

22:40.251 --> 22:41.920
Yeah, it's funny.

22:42.003 --> 22:43.338
It's kind of like you just stole it.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.048
I know!

22:46.717 --> 22:49.511
Mm! You know what sounds good?

22:49.594 --> 22:51.971
Let's go do some coke
and then play some laser tag.

22:52.055 --> 22:53.014
Oh, no, I'm not up for that.

22:53.097 --> 22:54.140
Come on.

22:54.224 --> 22:56.476
Hey, hey! What the fuck?
That's my jacket.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.812
- Uh...
- She's trying to steal my jacket.

22:58.896 --> 22:59.979
Hold my drink.

23:00.063 --> 23:01.272
No, I'm not.

23:01.356 --> 23:03.483
He bought it for me. It's from Paris.

23:03.567 --> 23:05.443
It's from fucking Topshop, and it's mine.

23:05.527 --> 23:06.444
- Give it back.
- No.

23:06.528 --> 23:07.529
- Give it back.
- No!

23:07.612 --> 23:08.613
- Hey, come on.
- Give it back!

23:08.697 --> 23:10.824
- No!
- Oh, shit.

23:10.908 --> 23:11.950
Break it up!

23:12.033 --> 23:12.951
Ladies!

23:13.034 --> 23:14.285
All right, take it out of here!

23:14.369 --> 23:16.496
Rape! No!

23:16.580 --> 23:18.540
- Dev, help. Help.
- Sorry. I don't know.

23:18.623 --> 23:20.333
Tell them she's being crazy!

23:20.417 --> 23:22.335
- No, I-- I don't know--
- Tell them she's being crazy.

23:22.419 --> 23:24.337
Listen--
Dev, what the fuck?

23:24.421 --> 23:26.715
Oh, okay, no, that's our song!

23:26.798 --> 23:28.258
I don't know you.

23:29.426 --> 23:31.052
You got to meet her outside, man.

23:31.135 --> 23:34.055
Um, yeah,
I actually might just kick it here.

23:34.138 --> 23:36.307
Probably a good call, player.

23:40.896 --> 23:42.480
Dev?

23:42.564 --> 23:43.565
Hey!

23:43.648 --> 23:44.816
- Hey.
- Rachel.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.984
How is everything?

23:46.067 --> 23:47.277
You remembered my name.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.695
Ah, yeah, I remembered your name.

23:48.779 --> 23:50.029
Well, I mean, I hadn't heard from you.

23:50.113 --> 23:51.030
I hadn't heard from you either.

23:51.114 --> 23:52.657
That's a two-way street.

23:52.741 --> 23:54.492
I'm actually really glad
that I ran into you.

23:54.576 --> 23:57.454
'Cause it turns out
that that Plan B pill was a dud.

23:57.579 --> 23:59.998
And I had your kid--
Kids, actually.

24:00.081 --> 24:00.958
It was twins.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.209
Yeah, one white, one Indian.

24:03.293 --> 24:05.420
You know, I thought it would
probably be two beige ones.

24:05.503 --> 24:06.797
That's interesting.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.715
So what did you think of the show?

24:08.799 --> 24:09.716
Thought it was great.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.134
How did you weasel in here?

24:11.217 --> 24:12.135
I'm here for work.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.720
I do PR for the label.

24:13.804 --> 24:16.848
But it was a secret show,
so it was pretty easy on the PR front.

24:16.932 --> 24:18.809
I guess I fucked up 'cause
a lot of people showed up.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.602
What about you? How was your night?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.897
Um, I was on a date that is now over

24:23.981 --> 24:25.649
because she got thrown out of the venue.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.026
What? Oh, my God, that sucks.

24:28.109 --> 24:29.319
Uh, oh, no, I'm thrilled.

24:29.402 --> 24:30.320
She was a nightmare.

24:30.403 --> 24:32.155
Really? What happened?

24:32.238 --> 24:35.700
She began the night with an
aggressive Cartman impression

24:35.784 --> 24:37.995
and then ended it by being kicked out

24:38.077 --> 24:39.663
for stealing someone's jacket.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.247
Ugh, brutal.

24:41.331 --> 24:42.833
But Cartman's really funny, though.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.584
That's what she kept insisting.

24:44.668 --> 24:46.503
I'm actually headed over
to the after party.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.005
It's at Achilles Heel.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.422
If you want to come,
I can talk to the person

24:49.506 --> 24:51.049
in charge of the list.

24:51.132 --> 24:52.300
Eh?

24:52.383 --> 24:53.760
Yeah, that'd be cool.

24:53.844 --> 24:55.053
Um, I got to meet my friend Denise,

24:55.136 --> 24:56.387
but I'll maybe stop by later.

24:56.471 --> 24:57.388
All right, cool.

24:57.472 --> 24:58.932
All right.

24:59.016 --> 25:00.475
Well, tell them twins I said, "What's up?"

25:00.558 --> 25:02.602
Yeah, they are expecting
child support, so...

25:02.686 --> 25:04.562
Oh, well, tell the white one
to keep waiting.

25:04.646 --> 25:06.857
I'm only supporting the one
that looks like me, so...

25:08.066 --> 25:09.901
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

25:10.485 --> 25:12.278
Was this Plan B apple juice girl?

25:12.362 --> 25:13.989
Mm-hmm.

25:14.072 --> 25:15.699
Yeah, she was pretty cool.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.534
She invited me to this thing
at Achilles Heel later.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.118
I might check it out. What's your story?

25:19.202 --> 25:20.286
I'm grabbing drinks with Michelle,

25:20.370 --> 25:21.997
AKA Princess Love.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.414
Lil' Funyuns? Seriously?

25:23.498 --> 25:25.124
Yeah, man. Look, she's cute.

25:25.208 --> 25:26.710
Plus, I fuck with Funyuns.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.546
I mean, I'm more
of a Cheetos girl, but whatever.

You can't encourage
that kind of behavior, though.

Yeah, but she left me, like,
one more voice mail,

Vibe, A-minus. Girls, A-minus.
Overall, A-minus."

into three categories.

Look, people aren't gonna always
be magical right away.
