WEBVTT

00:30.963 --> 00:32.198
<i>Earth-That-Was...</i>

00:32.298 --> 00:35.426
<i>could no longer sustain
our numbers, we were so many.</i>

00:38.938 --> 00:41.133
<i>We found a new solar system:</i>

00:41.607 --> 00:44.405
<i>Dozens of planets
and hundreds of moons.</i>

00:46.112 --> 00:49.449
<i>Each one terraformed,
a process taking decades...</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:52.712
<i>to support human life.
To be new Earths.</i>

00:53.286 --> 00:55.652
<i>The central planets
formed the Alliance.</i>

00:55.922 --> 00:58.057
<i>Ruled by an interplanetary
parliament...</i>

00:58.157 --> 01:00.625
<i>the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization.</i>

01:01.794 --> 01:04.397
<i>The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened...</i>

01:04.497 --> 01:06.522
<i>and refused Alliance control.</i>

01:07.199 --> 01:09.565
<i>The war was devastating.</i>

01:10.369 --> 01:12.538
<i>But the Alliance's victory
over the Independents...</i>

01:12.638 --> 01:14.607
<i>ensured a safer universe.</i>

01:14.707 --> 01:16.876
And now, everyone
can enjoy the comfort...

01:16.976 --> 01:19.274
and enlightenment
of true civilization.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.348
Why were the Independents
even fighting us?

01:22.448 --> 01:24.383
Why wouldn't they look
to be more civilized?

01:24.483 --> 01:27.053
- I hear they're cannibals.
- That's only Reavers.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.255
- Reavers aren't real.
- Full well they are.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.157
I heard they attack settlers
from space...

01:31.257 --> 01:32.658
and kill them,
and wear their skins...

01:32.758 --> 01:34.919
and rape them
for hours and hours...

01:37.330 --> 01:40.925
It's true that there are
dangers on the outer planets.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.503
So with so many social
and medical advancements...

01:43.603 --> 01:45.671
we can bring
to the Independents...

01:45.771 --> 01:47.573
why would they fight
so hard against us?

01:47.673 --> 01:49.242
We meddle.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.977
River?

01:51.077 --> 01:53.079
People don't like
to be meddled with.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.281
We tell them what to do,
what to think.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.381
Don't run, don't walk.

01:57.483 --> 02:00.920
We're in their homes and in their
heads and we haven't the right.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.020
We're meddlesome.

02:03.756 --> 02:06.953
River, we're not telling
people what to think...

02:07.627 --> 02:09.788
we're just trying
to show them how.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.160
She's dreaming. Got that?
Off the charts.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.735
Scary monsters.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.860
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.341
See, most of our best work
is done when they're asleep.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.977
We can monitor and direct
their subconscious...

02:25.077 --> 02:27.046
implant suggestions.

02:27.146 --> 02:30.673
It's a little startling to see at
first, but results are spectacular.

02:30.816 --> 02:34.186
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

02:34.286 --> 02:35.655
I've heard that.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.590
She'll be ideal
for defense deployment...

02:37.690 --> 02:39.690
even with the side effects.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.060
Tell me about them.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.651
Well, obviously,
she's unstable.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.499
The neural stripping
does tend to fragment...

02:46.599 --> 02:48.134
their own reality matrix.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.336
- It manifests as borderline...
- What use do we have...

02:50.436 --> 02:52.104
for a psychic if she's insane?

02:52.204 --> 02:54.073
She's not just a psychic.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.709
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

02:56.809 --> 03:00.404
She has her lucid periods. We're
hoping to improve upon the...

03:01.647 --> 03:04.050
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to ask.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.641
Is there a reason
for this inspection?

03:06.919 --> 03:08.919
Am I making you nervous?

03:09.155 --> 03:12.124
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.

03:12.224 --> 03:14.093
I was told that
the Alliance's support...

03:14.193 --> 03:15.628
for the project was unanimous.

03:15.728 --> 03:19.095
- The demonstration of her power...
- How is she physically?

03:19.231 --> 03:21.231
Like nothing we've seen.

03:21.834 --> 03:25.395
All our subjects are conditioned
for combat, but River...

03:26.505 --> 03:29.338
she's a creature
of extraordinary grace.

03:29.975 --> 03:31.975
Yes.

03:32.511 --> 03:34.604
She always
did love to dance.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.844
River, it's Simon.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.290
Please, it's Simon.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.625
It's your brother.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.901
Simon.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.405
They know you've come.

04:06.145 --> 04:08.670
We can't make it
to the surface from inside.

04:11.283 --> 04:13.283
Find out.

04:41.680 --> 04:46.379
A subject is loose,
security breach. Shaft 7.

05:03.702 --> 05:05.438
Stop.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.439
Backtrack. Stop.

05:20.786 --> 05:21.987
Excuse me...

05:22.087 --> 05:24.056
no one is allowed
in the records room...

05:24.156 --> 05:25.891
without my express permission.

05:25.991 --> 05:29.222
Forgive me, but I prefer to
see the event alone, without...

05:30.396 --> 05:31.363
bias.

05:31.463 --> 05:34.762
- I need to see your clearance.
- And you are right to insist.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.899
<i>Parliamentary override.
Full access.</i>

05:40.239 --> 05:41.307
Apologies.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.641
An operative of
the Parliament...

05:42.741 --> 05:45.107
will, of course,
have full cooperation.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.611
I'm not sure what...

05:48.447 --> 05:51.610
- I see no listing of rank or name.
- I have neither.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.782
Like this facility,
I don't exist.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.088
Let's talk about the Tams.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.126
I assume you've
scanned the status logs...

06:00.226 --> 06:03.320
River was your greatest
success. A prodigy.

06:03.762 --> 06:05.698
A phenomenon.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.995
Until her brother walked in
here and took her from you.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.871
- It's not quite so simple.
- I'm well aware of that.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.774
- There was no way that I could...
- No. No. Of course.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.842
The boy spent his entire
fortune developing...

06:16.942 --> 06:18.611
the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.213
Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

06:21.313 --> 06:23.577
- It's madness.
- Madness?

06:24.483 --> 06:27.179
Have you looked at this
scan carefully, Doctor?

06:27.987 --> 06:29.987
At his face?

06:31.790 --> 06:35.089
It's love, in point of fact.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.889
Something a good deal
more dangerous.

06:38.063 --> 06:39.098
Why are you here?

06:39.198 --> 06:43.828
Because the situation is even
less simple than you think.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.764
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?

06:49.074 --> 06:51.074
- I wonder if...
- It's pride.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.714
<i>Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject.</i>

06:59.919 --> 07:02.513
<i>I was told that
the Alliance's support...</i>

07:02.955 --> 07:07.085
"Key members of Parliament."

07:10.229 --> 07:12.229
Key.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.600
The minds behind
every military...

07:14.700 --> 07:17.236
diplomatic,
and covert operation...

07:17.336 --> 07:19.972
in the galaxy,
and you put them...

07:20.072 --> 07:22.506
in a room with a psychic.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.874
If there was some classified
information that she...

07:28.013 --> 07:29.915
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

07:30.015 --> 07:31.050
Nor do I.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.085
And judging by her
deteriorating mental state...

07:33.185 --> 07:34.420
I'd say we're both
better off.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.148
Secrets are not my concern.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.323
Keeping them is.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.997
Whatever secrets she might
have accidentally gleaned...

07:45.097 --> 07:47.533
it's probable she doesn't
even know she knows them.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.363
That they're buried
beneath layers of psychosis.

07:50.536 --> 07:55.337
You know, in certain
older civilized cultures...

07:55.574 --> 07:57.576
when men failed as entirely...

07:57.676 --> 08:00.167
as you have,
they would throw themselves...

08:00.379 --> 08:01.447
on their swords.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.141
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

08:07.286 --> 08:10.055
I would put that down
right now, if I were you.

08:10.155 --> 08:13.181
Would you be killed in your
sleep like an ailing pet?

08:25.204 --> 08:27.204
Young miss...

08:30.409 --> 08:34.046
Young miss, I'll need all the logs
on behavioral modification triggers.

08:34.146 --> 08:35.547
We'll have to reach out
to River Tam...

08:35.647 --> 08:37.049
and help her
to come back to us.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.310
No matter how
far out Simon has...

08:40.753 --> 08:42.753
This is a good death.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.024
There's no shame in this...

08:47.760 --> 08:52.094
in a man's death.
A man who has done fine works.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.532
We're making a better world.

08:57.903 --> 08:59.903
All of them...

09:00.973 --> 09:02.973
better worlds.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.014
Young miss,
I need you to go to work now.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.950
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

09:24.363 --> 09:28.925
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

10:26.825 --> 10:29.555
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

10:33.031 --> 10:34.199
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

10:34.299 --> 10:36.535
- It did seem to resemble...
- Did the primary buffer panel...

10:36.635 --> 10:39.604
just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

10:41.540 --> 10:42.541
Looks like.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.176
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.245
- I've a clear memory of it.
- If she doesn't get us...

10:46.345 --> 10:48.881
extra flow from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

10:48.981 --> 10:50.582
this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

10:50.682 --> 10:53.617
- Define "interesting."
- "Oh, God, we're all gonna die?"

10:55.821 --> 10:58.290
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

10:58.390 --> 11:00.459
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

11:00.559 --> 11:02.895
slight turbulence
and then explode.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.496
- Can you shave the vector?
- I'm doing it!

11:04.596 --> 11:07.232
- It's not enough.
- Just get us on the ground!

11:07.332 --> 11:09.732
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

11:10.602 --> 11:13.005
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.673
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

11:14.773 --> 11:16.642
- You only got two arms.
- I just get excitable.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.610
And as to choice, I like to
have my options open.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.013
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.683
What you plan and what takes place
ain't ever exactly been similar.

11:24.783 --> 11:27.183
No grenades.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.488
We crashing again?
Talk to your husband.

11:29.588 --> 11:30.789
- Mule prepped?
- Good to go, sir.

11:30.889 --> 11:31.857
Just loading her up.

11:31.957 --> 11:32.958
Those grenades?

11:33.058 --> 11:34.426
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

11:34.526 --> 11:37.051
Jayne, we're robbing the
place. We're not occupying it.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.667
Kaylee!

11:46.305 --> 11:49.408
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

11:49.508 --> 11:51.443
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right...

11:51.543 --> 11:53.807
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.316
You told me those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

11:57.416 --> 12:01.409
- That was six months ago, Captain.
- My ship don't crash.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.915
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.260
Doctor.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.523
Guess who needs to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.765
Bit of a rockety ride.

12:13.865 --> 12:16.333
- Nothing to be worried about.
- I'm not worried.

12:16.668 --> 12:18.637
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.331
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

12:22.374 --> 12:26.572
Well, kind of hard to tell one
from the other, face like yours.

12:27.112 --> 12:29.945
Well, I imagine if it were
fear, my eyes would be wider.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.750
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.118
You're not taking her.

12:33.218 --> 12:36.054
No, no, this is not a thing I'm
interested in talking over with...

12:36.154 --> 12:38.423
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

12:38.523 --> 12:41.460
I hear the words "that's final"
come out your mouth ever again...

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
they truly will be.

12:43.996 --> 12:47.159
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

12:47.599 --> 12:48.967
Guests?

12:49.067 --> 12:51.370
- Now, I earned my passage, Captain...
- And it's time...

12:51.470 --> 12:53.238
your little sister learned
from your example.

12:53.338 --> 12:55.568
I have earned my passage...

12:56.141 --> 12:59.444
treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

12:59.544 --> 13:01.280
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.315
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.551
Didn't say "want."
Said "will."

13:05.651 --> 13:07.286
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.946
She's a 17-year-old girl.

13:10.255 --> 13:12.917
- A mentally traumatized 17...
- She's a reader.

13:13.358 --> 13:15.294
Sees into the truth of things.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.096
Might see trouble before it's
coming. Which is of use to me.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.563
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

13:22.167 --> 13:25.625
Honestly, Doctor, I think we may
really crash this time anyway.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.006
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

13:28.106 --> 13:29.508
to keep River away
from the Alliance?

13:29.608 --> 13:32.144
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

13:32.244 --> 13:33.779
enough to keep
to our own selves.

13:33.879 --> 13:37.007
- Are you threatening to...
- I look out for me and mine.

13:37.683 --> 13:40.919
That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

13:41.019 --> 13:44.156
You stuck a thorn in the Alliance's
paw. That tickles me a bit.

13:44.256 --> 13:47.025
But it also means I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

13:47.125 --> 13:49.561
and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

13:49.661 --> 13:51.363
Even honest ones.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.699
Put this crew together with
the promise of work...

13:53.799 --> 13:55.968
Which the Alliance makes
harder every year.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.270
Come a day there won't be
room for naughty men like us...

13:58.370 --> 13:59.972
to slip about at all.

14:00.072 --> 14:03.166
This job goes south,
there well may not be another.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.640
So here is us,
on the raggedy edge.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.208
Don't push me,
and I won't push you.

14:25.997 --> 14:29.434
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten this
boat out before we get flattened?

14:29.534 --> 14:33.061
Like a downy feather, sir.
No one flies like my mister.

14:42.247 --> 14:43.615
River.

14:43.715 --> 14:47.515
I know.
We're going for a ride.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.930
Hey, little one.

15:10.308 --> 15:12.503
Understand your part
in all this?

15:14.846 --> 15:16.846
Do you?

15:17.649 --> 15:19.649
This is what I do, darling.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.121
This is what I do.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.092
Let's move, people.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.230
Quit fiddling. Want the boat
running smooth when we get back.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.958
- Have faith, Captain.
- Not today.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.934
Pair of clips
in the rear hatch.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.673
We should hit town
right during Sunday worship.

15:41.773 --> 15:43.075
Won't be any crowds.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.444
If Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll...

15:45.544 --> 15:47.579
this could look to be
a sunny day for us.

15:47.679 --> 15:49.548
River, stay behind the others.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.674
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

15:53.718 --> 15:55.718
It's okay
to leave them to die.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.513
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.060
If anything happens to her,
anything at all...

16:02.160 --> 16:05.030
I swear to you
I will get very choked up.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.130
Honestly.
There could be tears.

16:15.774 --> 16:19.972
Don't mind the Captain none, Simon.
I know he'll look out for her.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.807
They'll be back
before you can spit.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.952
Well, not that you spit.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.127
What are we hoping
to find here...

16:35.227 --> 16:36.628
that equals
the worth of a turd?

16:36.728 --> 16:39.531
Security payroll. Alliance
don't have the manpower...

16:39.631 --> 16:42.200
to "enforce the peace"
on every outer-rim planet.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.537
They hire out to the private
firms, who will not work for credit.

16:45.637 --> 16:49.040
They get paid in cashy money,
which once a month rests here.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.143
Don't that lead back to
the Alliance, anyhow?

16:51.243 --> 16:54.079
No private firm would ever report
the theft of their own payroll.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.315
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

16:57.415 --> 17:01.019
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.
Won't but rattle the floor.

17:01.119 --> 17:05.283
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.416
Hands and knees and heads
bowed down! Everybody, down!

17:18.136 --> 17:20.195
Looks like this is the place.

17:20.405 --> 17:23.966
You all wanna be looking very
intently at your own belly buttons.

17:24.075 --> 17:27.306
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.382
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here...

17:30.482 --> 17:32.643
but what we're after
is not yours.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.385
So let's have
no undue fussing.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.121
She's locked up.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.703
Do you know what
the definition of a hero is?

18:27.405 --> 18:29.600
Someone who gets
other people killed.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.908
You can look it up later.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.913
Big happy family.

18:46.224 --> 18:49.716
At last. We can retire and
give up this life of crime.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.301
Hey!

18:58.937 --> 19:01.740
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.875
Petty thieving
ain't exactly soldiers' work.

19:03.975 --> 19:08.275
War's long done. We're all
just folk now. Listen up!

19:09.014 --> 19:10.682
We are coming down
to empty that vault!

19:10.782 --> 19:13.649
You have to give me
your authorization password!

19:17.722 --> 19:19.722
Okay.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.037
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.375
Did sound somewhat like gun blast.
Maybe you ought run tell Lawman.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.842
What the hell is up?
You all right?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.650
What's going on?

19:48.853 --> 19:50.853
Reavers.

19:56.728 --> 20:00.332
The leg is good. It'll bleed plenty
and we avoid any necessary organs.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.766
I was thinking
more of a graze.

20:01.866 --> 20:03.668
No, you don't want it
to look like you gave up.

20:03.768 --> 20:04.936
No, I get that.

20:05.036 --> 20:06.404
Mal!

20:06.504 --> 20:08.740
Every heist, he's got
to start yelling my name.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.707
Mal! Reavers!

20:12.077 --> 20:14.646
The girl's pitching a fit. They're
here or they're coming soon.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.648
Get on the Mule.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.984
Does that lock from the inside? Yes.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.553
Get everyone upstairs. You get
them down here and you seal it.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.189
As long as you got air you
don't open up, you understand?

20:24.289 --> 20:27.383
Get them inside the vault!

20:27.625 --> 20:30.595
- You see them?
- Zoe, take the wheel!

20:30.695 --> 20:32.695
Anybody see them?

20:38.536 --> 20:39.738
Take me with you!

20:39.838 --> 20:41.473
Get back in the vault with
the others.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.476
- I can't stay here! Please!
- It's too many. Move ahead.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.576
Please!

21:20.578 --> 21:23.069
Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

21:32.023 --> 21:33.692
How come they ain't
blowing us out the air?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.659
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.491
They want us alive
when they eat us.

21:40.932 --> 21:44.925
Boy, sure would be nice if we had
some grenades, don't you think?

21:46.471 --> 21:49.574
- Wash, baby, can you hear me?
- We're moments from air.

21:49.674 --> 21:51.972
- You got somebody behind you?
- Reavers.

21:54.279 --> 21:55.280
Kaylee!

21:55.380 --> 21:57.380
<i>Heat her up. We got Reavers.</i>

22:01.252 --> 22:04.289
- We're not gonna get to you in time.
- Keep moving, honey.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.389
We're coming to you.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.693
- Where's my clips?
- Rear hatch.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.316
I won't get ate!

22:33.985 --> 22:38.422
You shoot me if they take me!
Well, don't shoot me first!

22:57.242 --> 22:59.210
Get some distance on them.

22:59.310 --> 23:02.108
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.382
We're gonna try
a Barn Swallow.

23:04.482 --> 23:06.482
<i>Simon! Open her up!</i>

23:11.556 --> 23:12.991
They're closing on us!

23:13.091 --> 23:15.286
Those rocks,
give them a taste.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.241
<i>Okay, baby,
we talked this through.</i>

23:36.547 --> 23:38.547
Talking ain't doing.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.859
- River?
- I swallowed a bug.

24:26.331 --> 24:29.823
- Are you okay?
- Is he okay?

24:43.147 --> 24:45.513
<i>We all here? What's going on?</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:47.817
Hello?

24:49.620 --> 24:51.089
No casualties.

24:51.189 --> 24:53.658
- Anybody following?
<i>- Nice flying, baby.</i>

24:53.758 --> 24:56.192
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

24:56.594 --> 25:00.899
Set course for Beaumonde.
First thing, I want this body...

25:00.999 --> 25:02.999
Simon!

25:05.003 --> 25:06.738
You son of a whore.
I'm a hair's breadth...

25:06.838 --> 25:08.139
from riddling
you with holes, Doctor.

25:08.239 --> 25:11.676
One simple job! She'll
be fine! She is fine!

25:11.776 --> 25:13.878
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

25:13.978 --> 25:17.675
Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
left there. She felt them coming.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.918
Never again.
You understand me?

25:20.018 --> 25:22.787
Seems I remember a talk about
you giving orders on my boat.

25:22.887 --> 25:24.422
Well, we're off your boat.

25:24.522 --> 25:26.958
Just as soon as River
gets her share of the bounty.

25:27.058 --> 25:29.822
- Let's not do anything hasty...
- No, shiny!

25:30.094 --> 25:31.663
We'll be on Beaumonde
in 10 hours' time...

25:31.763 --> 25:34.630
you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

25:34.899 --> 25:37.732
Meantime, you do your job.

25:38.636 --> 25:40.636
Patch up my crew.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.540
He didn't lie down.

25:45.943 --> 25:47.943
They never lie down.

25:56.387 --> 25:58.756
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us...

25:58.856 --> 26:00.792
without River
and Simon on board...

26:00.892 --> 26:02.260
but how long
do you think they'll last?

26:02.360 --> 26:03.895
Doc made his call.

26:03.995 --> 26:04.963
Yeah.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.864
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

26:06.964 --> 26:08.766
We sheltered them plenty.

26:08.866 --> 26:12.199
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.072
Like that man back in town?

26:18.876 --> 26:20.244
I had to shoot him.

26:20.344 --> 26:22.313
What Reavers would've done
before they killed him...

26:22.413 --> 26:24.904
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.719
But before that, him begging
us to bring him along.

26:29.887 --> 26:32.790
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

26:32.890 --> 26:36.155
- You know that for certain?
- Mule won't run with five.

26:36.828 --> 26:40.559
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

26:40.731 --> 26:42.731
Oh, Jayne...

26:43.000 --> 26:45.798
- You could've tossed the payload.
- Tossed the...

26:47.004 --> 26:50.742
Zoe, I got bits falling off my
ship, I got a crew ain't been paid...

26:50.842 --> 26:53.811
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need
to eat sometime this month.

26:54.245 --> 26:55.913
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job...

26:56.013 --> 26:58.013
what do think
they'll do to us?

26:59.884 --> 27:01.884
We're close to gone out here.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.388
We get a job,
we got to make good.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.585
Sir, I don't disagree
on any particular point.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.361
It's just...

27:14.699 --> 27:17.930
in the time of war, we would've
never left a man stranded.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.337
Maybe that's why we lost.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.448
That was close.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.452
I do not get it.

27:36.687 --> 27:38.489
How's a guy get so wrong?

27:38.589 --> 27:42.047
Cutting on his own face,
raping and murdering.

27:44.962 --> 27:46.962
I'll kill a man
in a fair fight...

27:47.765 --> 27:50.290
or if I think he's gonna
start a fair fight...

27:51.135 --> 27:54.662
or if he bothers me,
or if there's a woman...

27:55.106 --> 27:59.941
or if I'm getting paid. Mostly
only when I'm getting paid.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.781
These Reavers,
the last 10 years...

28:03.881 --> 28:06.714
they show up like
the boogeyman from stories.

28:07.718 --> 28:11.017
Eating people alive?
Where does that get fun?

28:12.623 --> 28:14.926
Shepherd Book said
they was men who just...

28:15.026 --> 28:18.362
reached the edge of space,
saw a vasty nothingness...

28:18.462 --> 28:20.462
and went
bibbledy over it.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.598
Oh, hell.

28:23.367 --> 28:25.367
I've been to the edge.

28:25.636 --> 28:29.504
Just looked like more space.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.876
I don't know.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.342
It can get awful Ionely
in the black.

28:35.613 --> 28:39.105
Like to get addlepated ourselves,
we stay on this boat much longer.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.375
Captain will drive
us all off, one by one.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.020
Just like Simon and River.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.791
Just like Inara.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.394
<i>Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?</i>

28:52.496 --> 28:54.999
<i>We got to have records
of everything, Inara.</i>

28:55.099 --> 28:58.967
<i>A bona fide companion entertained
clients on this very ship.</i>

28:59.503 --> 29:02.840
<i>- In this very bed.
- Well, I can't do my work here.</i>

29:02.940 --> 29:04.942
<i>And I don't think
the Captain approves.</i>

29:05.042 --> 29:06.611
<i>The Captain
wants you to stay...</i>

29:06.711 --> 29:10.078
<i>That man doesn't know what he
wants. I don't have time to...</i>

29:44.248 --> 29:46.751
Don't talk to the barkers,
talk to the captains.

29:46.851 --> 29:50.252
You look the captain in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

29:50.821 --> 29:52.821
I wish there was...

29:55.860 --> 29:58.021
You shouldn't
ought to be so clean.

29:58.462 --> 30:01.933
It's a dead giveaway you don't
belong, you always got to be tidy.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.033
Don't pay anybody in advance.

30:05.636 --> 30:08.105
And don't ride in anything
with a Capissen 38 engine...

30:08.205 --> 30:10.205
they fall right
out of the sky.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.875
Kaylee.

30:23.654 --> 30:25.849
River, do you want
to stay with them?

30:27.491 --> 30:29.491
It isn't safe.

30:30.795 --> 30:32.795
No.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.191
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.703
For them.

30:57.588 --> 30:59.824
<i>...only survivors
of the massacre apparently...</i>

30:59.924 --> 31:02.660
<i>locked themselves in
the train station vault.</i>

31:02.760 --> 31:05.730
Kaylee, this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when...

31:05.830 --> 31:07.265
When he's
four worlds away?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.667
Or the Alliance gets a hold
of him and River?

31:09.767 --> 31:10.801
That ain't my worry.

31:10.901 --> 31:13.170
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.270
Can't do that
carrying those two.

31:15.506 --> 31:17.375
How can you be so cold?

31:17.475 --> 31:19.636
Captain didn't
make them fugitives.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.905
But he could
have made them family.

31:22.079 --> 31:24.877
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

31:25.616 --> 31:28.517
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've...

31:29.086 --> 31:31.889
We're going on a year now, I ain't
had nothing twixt my nethers...

31:31.989 --> 31:33.524
weren't run on batteries.

31:33.624 --> 31:35.854
Oh, God! I can't know that!

31:36.093 --> 31:38.093
I could stand
to hear a little more.

31:38.763 --> 31:40.398
If you had a care
for anybody's heart...

31:40.498 --> 31:42.099
You knew
he was gonna leave.

31:42.199 --> 31:43.968
We never been but a way
station to those two.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.670
And how do you know
what he feels?

31:45.770 --> 31:48.706
He's got River to worry on but
he still could've shown you...

31:48.806 --> 31:51.042
If I truly wanted
someone bad enough...

31:51.142 --> 31:54.737
wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse
could stop me from going to her.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.246
Tell that to Inara.

32:01.485 --> 32:03.485
Domestic troubles?

32:03.587 --> 32:05.489
Domestic troubles?

32:05.589 --> 32:08.626
'Cause we don't
wanna interrupt.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.861
A man should keep
his house in order.

32:10.961 --> 32:12.430
Fanty. Mingo.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.828
- He's Mingo.
- He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

32:16.066 --> 32:19.126
- How is it you always know?
- Fanty's prettier.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.437
Feel to do some business?

32:28.179 --> 32:30.179
Endeavors.

32:37.521 --> 32:39.223
Quite a crew you've got.

32:39.323 --> 32:41.325
Yeah, they're
a fine bunch of reubens.

32:41.425 --> 32:43.794
How you keep them on that
crap boat, is the subject...

32:43.894 --> 32:45.663
of much musing
between me and Fanty.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.095
- We go on and on.
- So I'm noticing.

32:49.099 --> 32:51.294
Is there a problem
we don't know of?

32:52.036 --> 32:53.537
You got a sweet take
kissing your foot.

32:53.637 --> 32:56.707
<i>How's about you take your 25%,
we can talk about the next job?</i>

32:56.807 --> 32:58.807
Well, our end is 40, precious.

32:58.943 --> 33:01.844
- My muscular buttocks it's 40.
- It is...

33:02.213 --> 33:04.148
as of now.

33:04.248 --> 33:05.850
Find anyone around
going cheaper...

33:05.950 --> 33:08.119
Find anyone
around going near...

33:08.219 --> 33:10.688
a sorry lot like you
in the first instance.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.523
You're unpredictable, Mal.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.558
You run
when you ought to fight.

33:14.658 --> 33:16.658
Fight when you ought to deal.

33:16.861 --> 33:18.920
Makes a businessperson
a little twitchy.

33:25.536 --> 33:30.405
<i># Fruity bars,
make a man of a mouse #</i>

33:31.809 --> 33:33.868
<i># Fruity oaty bars, pow! #</i>

33:33.978 --> 33:36.714
<i># Make you bust
out of your blouse #</i>

33:36.814 --> 33:39.647
<i># Eat them now, bang! ##</i>

33:55.432 --> 33:57.432
Miranda.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.095
Hey! A tussle!

34:25.195 --> 34:27.195
Jayne.

34:45.049 --> 34:46.884
Do you know that girl?

34:46.984 --> 34:48.984
I really don't.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.073
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!

36:58.215 --> 36:59.283
May I see her?

36:59.383 --> 37:01.885
I believe you've got
some storytelling to do.

37:01.985 --> 37:03.954
What in the hell happened
back there?

37:04.054 --> 37:06.890
Start with the part where Jayne
gets knocked out by a 90-pound girl.

37:06.990 --> 37:09.584
'Cause I don't think
that's ever getting old.

37:10.060 --> 37:13.086
- Do we know if anyone was killed?
- It's likely.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.966
I know she meant to kill me
before the Doc put her out.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.557
Which, how exactly
does that work anyhow?

37:20.104 --> 37:22.104
It's a safe word.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.109
The people who helped me
break River out...

37:25.209 --> 37:27.478
had intel that River and the
other subjects were being...

37:27.578 --> 37:29.842
embedded with
behavioral conditioning.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.980
They taught me a safe word...

37:32.082 --> 37:34.983
- in case something happened.
- Not sure I get it.

37:35.285 --> 37:37.879
It's a phrase
that makes her fall asleep.

37:38.188 --> 37:41.351
- If I speak the words...
- Don't say it!

37:41.558 --> 37:43.558
It only works on her, Jayne.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.197
Well, now I know that.

37:47.297 --> 37:49.458
"In case something happened."

37:49.833 --> 37:52.102
You feel to elaborate on
what that something might be?

37:52.202 --> 37:54.898
- They never said what...
- And you never did ask.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.608
Get your hands off...

37:57.708 --> 38:00.310
Eight months. Eight months,
you had her on my boat...

38:00.410 --> 38:01.945
knowing full well
she could go monkeyshit...

38:02.045 --> 38:03.514
at the wrong word.
You never said a thing.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.481
I brought her out here
so they couldn't get to her.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.316
- I don't even know what they...
- My ship!

38:09.419 --> 38:11.188
My crew!

38:11.288 --> 38:13.779
You had a gorramn
time bomb living with us!

38:15.058 --> 38:17.583
Who we gonna find in there
when she wakes up?

38:18.762 --> 38:20.464
The girl?

38:20.564 --> 38:22.499
Or the weapon?

38:22.599 --> 38:24.468
I thought
she was getting better.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.593
And I thought
they was getting off!

38:28.539 --> 38:32.373
Didn't we have an intricate plan how
they was gonna be not here anymore?

38:32.509 --> 38:35.535
- We couldn't leave them now.
- No, now that...

38:35.813 --> 38:40.045
she's a killer woman we ought be
bringing her tea and dumplings.

38:41.051 --> 38:43.611
In earnest, Mal,
why'd you bring her back on?

38:49.693 --> 38:51.693
May I see her?

39:00.671 --> 39:04.129
She goes woolly again, we're
gonna have to put a bullet to her.

39:04.741 --> 39:06.610
It's crossed my mind.

39:06.710 --> 39:09.338
Can I make a suggestion that
doesn't involve violence...

39:09.446 --> 39:11.415
- or is this the wrong crowd?
- Honey.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.017
We're flying a lot blinder
than usual here.

39:14.117 --> 39:16.117
We need to get our bearings.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.786
I think we need to talk
to Mr. Universe.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.176
Oh, this is good.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.851
You guys always bring me
the very best violence.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.992
<i>You think
you're in a hot place?</i>

39:55.092 --> 39:58.595
<i>That's what we're looking to learn.
Is there any follow up, a newswave?</i>

39:58.695 --> 40:01.994
There is no news. There's
the truth of the signal.

40:02.366 --> 40:06.097
What I see. And, there's
the puppet theater...

40:06.303 --> 40:09.500
the Parliament jesters foist
on the somnambulant public.

40:10.007 --> 40:12.942
Well, what about this? Did
this make the puppet theater?

40:13.110 --> 40:15.279
<i>No, sir.
And no lawforce flags, either.</i>

40:15.379 --> 40:17.281
<i>I had to go into
the security feed direct.</i>

40:17.381 --> 40:20.282
- You can do that?
- Can't stop the signal, Mal.

40:20.984 --> 40:23.851
<i>Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere.</i>

40:23.987 --> 40:25.923
<i>Security feeds
are a traipse to access...</i>

40:26.023 --> 40:27.658
<i>and I wasn't the first one in.</i>

40:27.758 --> 40:31.057
<i>- This has prints on it.</i>
- So somebody else has been fed this.

40:31.495 --> 40:34.998
<i>Zoe, you sultry minx,
stop falling in love with me.</i>

40:35.098 --> 40:36.967
<i>You're just gonna
embarrass yourself.</i>

40:37.067 --> 40:39.501
<i>I have a commitment
to my Lovebot.</i>

40:42.072 --> 40:45.974
It was a very beautiful ceremony.
Lenore wrote her own vows...

40:46.376 --> 40:50.005
I cried like a baby,
a hungry, angry baby.

40:53.116 --> 40:56.916
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

40:57.287 --> 40:58.355
Can you go back?

40:58.455 --> 41:00.290
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

41:00.390 --> 41:02.517
Made any kind
of contact with her.

41:05.495 --> 41:07.793
<i>- Miranda.</i>
- "Miranda"?

41:10.701 --> 41:12.536
Go back further.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.636
No.

41:16.139 --> 41:18.139
<i>Please.</i>

41:21.578 --> 41:24.706
Mal, you're very smart.

41:25.082 --> 41:28.381
- Someone is talking to her.
- The oaty bar?

41:31.388 --> 41:33.388
Subliminal.

41:33.623 --> 41:36.260
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.727
I've been seeing this code pop
up all over, the last few weeks.

41:40.163 --> 41:42.688
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

41:43.667 --> 41:48.161
<i>They have gone to enormous
trouble to find your little friend.</i>

41:49.106 --> 41:51.106
<i>And found her, they have.</i>

41:52.609 --> 41:55.100
<i>Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?</i>

42:02.919 --> 42:04.919
They're afraid of me.

42:05.822 --> 42:08.882
- I'm sorry.
- They should be.

42:10.127 --> 42:13.619
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

42:15.132 --> 42:18.226
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

42:19.569 --> 42:21.764
Show me off like a dog.

42:22.973 --> 42:24.441
Old men covered in blood.

42:24.541 --> 42:27.339
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

42:28.912 --> 42:32.177
I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

42:35.318 --> 42:37.582
In the Maidenhead,
you said something.

42:38.622 --> 42:40.891
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

42:40.991 --> 42:43.619
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

42:45.362 --> 42:47.362
Miranda.

42:48.265 --> 42:50.265
Miranda.

42:51.168 --> 42:53.168
Ask her.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.905
Who is Miranda?

43:01.311 --> 43:04.178
Am I talking to Miranda now?

43:07.117 --> 43:09.117
No.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.020
Not right.

43:13.957 --> 43:17.916
But I think
when they triggered you...

43:18.762 --> 43:20.762
it somehow brought this up.

43:21.264 --> 43:23.357
- This memory.
- It isn't mine.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.335
The memory, it isn't mine.

43:25.435 --> 43:28.336
And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

43:28.638 --> 43:31.004
- Don't make me sleep again.
- I won't.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.543
I won't.

43:33.643 --> 43:35.643
Put a bullet to me.

43:36.213 --> 43:38.807
Bullet in the brainpan,
squish.

43:40.851 --> 43:43.547
Don't say that. Not ever.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.156
We'll get through this.

43:50.660 --> 43:53.356
Things are going to get
much, much worse.

44:47.384 --> 44:49.682
Thanks for taking us in again,
Shepherd.

44:50.387 --> 44:52.322
You got a plan?

44:52.422 --> 44:53.757
Hiding ain't a plan?

44:53.857 --> 44:55.492
It'll do you for a spell.

44:55.592 --> 44:57.694
And the folks here'll be
glad of the extra coin.

44:57.794 --> 44:59.819
But the Alliance
will be coming.

45:00.063 --> 45:02.623
They're after this girl
with a powerful will.

45:03.400 --> 45:06.267
I look to hear the tromp
of their boots any moment.

45:08.705 --> 45:10.705
You won't.

45:12.409 --> 45:15.105
This isn't
a palms-up military run, Mal.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.580
No reports broadwaved...

45:19.049 --> 45:20.584
no warrants.

45:20.684 --> 45:23.084
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

45:23.687 --> 45:25.687
That means closed file.

45:26.489 --> 45:28.489
Means an operative.

45:28.959 --> 45:31.052
Which is trouble
you've not known.

45:33.496 --> 45:35.496
I could have left her there.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.669
I had an out.

45:39.769 --> 45:41.872
<i>Hell, I had every reason
in the 'verse...</i>

45:41.972 --> 45:44.133
<i>to leave her lay
and haul anchor.</i>

45:45.175 --> 45:47.175
It's not your way, Mal.

45:48.311 --> 45:50.311
I have a way?

45:50.647 --> 45:52.647
That better than a plan?

45:52.882 --> 45:56.147
Only one thing is gonna
walk you through this, Mal.

45:58.121 --> 46:00.121
Belief.

46:01.057 --> 46:03.226
You know I always look
to you for counsel...

46:03.326 --> 46:05.521
but sermons make me
sleepy, Shepherd.

46:06.229 --> 46:08.561
I ain't looking for help
from on high.

46:09.799 --> 46:12.002
That's a long wait
for a train don't come.

46:12.102 --> 46:16.061
When I talk about belief, why do you
always assume I'm talking about God?

46:22.012 --> 46:24.207
They'll come at you sideways.

46:24.981 --> 46:27.449
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

46:28.652 --> 46:32.452
Sidle up and smile.
Hit you where you're weak.

46:34.090 --> 46:37.025
Sort of man they're like
to send believes hard.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.253
Kills and never asks why.

46:45.335 --> 46:48.171
It's of interest to me how much
you seem to know about that world.

46:48.271 --> 46:50.373
I wasn't born
a Shepherd, Mal.

46:50.473 --> 46:52.737
Have to tell me
about that sometime.

46:54.611 --> 46:56.611
No, I don't.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.983
River?

47:02.319 --> 47:04.187
River, you look tired.

47:04.287 --> 47:08.053
I think everybody's a little tired
by now. Why don't we all lie down.

47:09.092 --> 47:12.061
A little peace and quiet
will make everything better.

47:12.228 --> 47:14.764
- River. Do as you're told.
- No.

47:14.864 --> 47:17.458
- It's going to be fine. Lie down.
- No.

47:21.838 --> 47:23.838
<i>Cut them down.</i>

47:27.410 --> 47:29.742
- What?
<i>- Mal! You up?</i>

47:30.613 --> 47:33.241
<i>I got a wave. I'm gonna
bounce it down to you.</i>

47:38.688 --> 47:40.557
Inara.

47:40.657 --> 47:43.490
<i>I...Is this a bad time?</i>

47:44.394 --> 47:45.996
No, this...

47:46.096 --> 47:47.664
good as any.

47:47.764 --> 47:50.494
- How's your world?
<i>- Cold. It's autumn here.</i>

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Still at the Training House?

47:56.806 --> 48:00.936
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't...

48:02.846 --> 48:05.906
- Well, you look very fine.
<i>- Oh. Thank you.</i>

48:06.282 --> 48:08.282
<i>So, what was the...</i>

48:10.553 --> 48:13.790
<i>I guess we're having something
of a problem here with the locals.</i>

48:13.890 --> 48:16.459
<i>- And, I thought maybe...</i>
- You could use a gun hand?

48:16.559 --> 48:20.723
<i>I'm hoping not. But if you
happen to be close at all, you...</i>

48:20.864 --> 48:24.857
<i>The crew could take your ease here
for a while. And there'd be payment.</i>

48:27.504 --> 48:30.735
Well, it would be...
I mean, I'd like to.

48:35.044 --> 48:37.580
Kaylee's been missing you
something fierce.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.316
- Oh, man.
<i>- I miss her, too.</i>

48:39.416 --> 48:41.484
<i>I even miss
my shuttle, occasionally.</i>

48:41.584 --> 48:43.677
Yeah, you left, um...

48:44.053 --> 48:45.755
Got some of your
stuff in a trunk.

48:45.855 --> 48:47.357
I never did get a chance
to drop it off.

48:47.457 --> 48:51.723
<i>- I didn't mean to leave stuff.</i>
- I didn't look through the stuff.

48:52.095 --> 48:55.258
I just...
Just sundries I expect.

48:58.168 --> 49:00.966
So I'll send you a wave,
soon as I can.

49:01.704 --> 49:03.704
<i>Thank you.</i>

49:11.815 --> 49:14.682
Inara, nice to see
her again.

49:16.653 --> 49:19.019
- So, trap?
- Trap.

49:19.556 --> 49:22.218
- We going in?
- Only but a few hours out.

49:22.826 --> 49:25.818
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

49:26.029 --> 49:28.431
If that's the case, then
Inara's already caught in it.

49:28.531 --> 49:30.531
She wouldn't
set us up willing.

49:30.767 --> 49:33.603
Might be we got a shot at seeing
who's turning these wheels.

49:33.703 --> 49:34.704
We go in.

49:34.804 --> 49:38.137
But how can you be sure Inara
don't just wanna see you?

49:39.075 --> 49:41.475
Sometimes people
have feelings.

49:41.644 --> 49:43.669
I'm referring here to people.

49:45.448 --> 49:47.541
You all were watching,
I take it.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.354
- Yes.
- Did you see us fight?

49:51.454 --> 49:53.454
- No.
- Trap.

50:00.997 --> 50:04.801
We're about 70 miles from the
Training House, and nobody on radar.

50:04.901 --> 50:07.337
If the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.

50:07.437 --> 50:08.571
They're about.

50:08.671 --> 50:10.673
Find us a home. I'll take
the shuttle a little closer.

50:10.773 --> 50:12.409
Zoe, ship is yours.

50:12.509 --> 50:15.011
Remember. If anything
happens to me...

50:15.111 --> 50:16.813
or if you don't hear from me
within the hour...

50:16.913 --> 50:19.149
you take this ship and
you come and you rescue me.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.784
What?

50:20.884 --> 50:23.182
- Risk my ship?
- I mean it.

50:23.620 --> 50:26.350
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

50:43.206 --> 50:46.543
Dear Buddha, please bring me a
pony, and a plastic rocket, and...

50:46.643 --> 50:48.643
Mal! What are you
doing here?

50:49.145 --> 50:50.313
Well, you invited me.

50:50.413 --> 50:52.949
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough to come.

50:53.049 --> 50:54.884
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

50:54.984 --> 50:56.886
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

50:56.986 --> 50:59.923
Which led me to conclude that
you must be in some trouble.

51:00.023 --> 51:01.758
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

51:01.858 --> 51:04.260
For a woman schooled in telling
a man what he wants to hear...

51:04.360 --> 51:07.852
- you ain't much of a liar.
- Mal, you cannot handle this man.

51:13.937 --> 51:15.071
I have to say, Captain...

51:15.171 --> 51:18.038
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

51:18.374 --> 51:21.468
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

51:22.645 --> 51:24.914
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

51:25.014 --> 51:27.014
I've no doubt.

51:27.784 --> 51:30.480
- What are you doing?
- I'm praying for you, Mal.

51:31.220 --> 51:33.220
She's very thoughtful.

51:33.423 --> 51:36.392
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.160
Speak your piece.

51:39.262 --> 51:41.097
I think you're
beginning to understand...

51:41.197 --> 51:43.197
how dangerous River Tam is.

51:43.533 --> 51:45.502
She is a mite unpredictable.

51:45.602 --> 51:47.470
Mood swings, of a sort.

51:47.570 --> 51:50.073
- It's worse than you know.
- It usually is.

51:50.173 --> 51:53.802
That girl will rain destruction
down on you and your ship.

51:55.211 --> 51:57.975
She is an albatross, Captain.

51:58.147 --> 51:59.883
Way I remember it...

51:59.983 --> 52:03.316
albatross was a ship's good
luck, till some idiot killed it.

52:03.853 --> 52:06.549
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

52:07.090 --> 52:09.090
I've seen your war record.

52:09.892 --> 52:12.452
I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

52:12.729 --> 52:14.924
- You really don't.
- Fair to say.

52:15.665 --> 52:18.468
But I have to hope you
understand, you can't beat us.

52:18.568 --> 52:20.270
I got no need to beat you.

52:20.370 --> 52:23.237
- I just want to go my way.
- And you can do that...

52:24.073 --> 52:27.099
once you let me take
River Tam back home.

52:30.813 --> 52:33.338
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

52:33.449 --> 52:36.145
- You got to open with payment.
- That is a trap.

52:36.285 --> 52:39.846
I offer money, you'll play the
man of honor and take umbrage.

52:40.056 --> 52:42.659
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

52:42.759 --> 52:45.284
I have no stomach for games.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.764
I already know
you will not see reason.

52:47.864 --> 52:49.399
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

52:49.499 --> 52:51.694
they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

52:57.940 --> 53:01.034
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

53:01.711 --> 53:05.238
We locked on to Serenity's pulse
beacon the moment you hit atmo.

53:05.381 --> 53:07.383
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

53:07.483 --> 53:10.153
to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

53:10.253 --> 53:12.253
You do that...

53:12.522 --> 53:15.389
you'd best make peace with
your dear and fluffy lord.

53:19.162 --> 53:20.563
Pulse beacon.

53:20.663 --> 53:24.622
Advice from an old tracker. You
want to find someone, use your eyes.

53:25.168 --> 53:27.403
How long do you think
you can really run from us?

53:27.503 --> 53:30.106
I never credited the Alliance
with an overabundance of brains.

53:30.206 --> 53:32.342
- And if you're the best they got...
- Captain Reynolds...

53:32.442 --> 53:35.211
I should tell you, so that
you don't waste your time...

53:35.311 --> 53:39.270
- you can't make me angry.
- Please, spend an hour with him.

53:40.049 --> 53:42.813
I want to resolve this
like civilized men.

53:43.886 --> 53:45.886
I'm not threatening you.

53:46.155 --> 53:48.155
- I'm unarmed.
- Good.

53:52.729 --> 53:54.764
I am, of course,
wearing full body armor.

53:54.864 --> 53:57.196
- I am not a moron.
- Wait, just let...

54:25.394 --> 54:27.296
What, no backup?

54:27.396 --> 54:30.566
Making an awful ruckus. They'll
come when they're needed.

54:30.666 --> 54:32.135
I'd start whistling.

54:32.235 --> 54:35.398
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

55:22.251 --> 55:26.551
Nothing here is what it seems.
He isn't the plucky hero.

55:27.390 --> 55:31.349
The Alliance isn't some evil
empire. This is not the grand arena.

55:31.594 --> 55:33.594
And that's not incense.

55:40.236 --> 55:41.404
Sir, can you hear me?

55:41.504 --> 55:44.029
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

55:49.745 --> 55:52.976
- What have you done to my shuttle?
- It's not your shuttle.

55:53.349 --> 55:55.349
Head east. Keep her low.

56:11.067 --> 56:12.835
Okay, forget the pulse beacon.

56:12.935 --> 56:15.071
<i>There must be another way
to track the ship.</i>

56:15.171 --> 56:16.539
Get a read on the NAVSAT.

56:16.639 --> 56:19.175
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

56:19.275 --> 56:20.243
<i>Sir?</i>

56:20.343 --> 56:22.178
Yes, have you found
a NAVSAT Trajectory?

56:22.278 --> 56:24.712
<i>Sir, we found seven.</i>

56:32.455 --> 56:34.455
<i>We've every reason
to be afraid.</i>

56:34.590 --> 56:37.560
Why, 'cause this guy beat
up Mal? That ain't so hard.

56:37.660 --> 56:40.163
- He didn't beat me up.
- Nobody said that.

56:40.263 --> 56:42.165
Because he's a believer.

56:42.265 --> 56:46.669
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief...

56:46.769 --> 56:49.138
that killing River
is the right thing to do.

56:49.238 --> 56:51.798
So no hope of a reward, huh?

56:52.742 --> 56:56.178
Did he say anything
about a Miranda?

56:56.979 --> 56:58.014
What is that?

56:58.114 --> 57:00.483
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.552
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

57:02.652 --> 57:05.521
You think maybe it poses some
kind of threat to the Alliance?

57:05.621 --> 57:07.290
Do we care?

57:07.390 --> 57:09.058
Are we caring about that?

57:09.158 --> 57:11.794
You dumb-ass hogs, the only
people she's a threat to is...

57:11.894 --> 57:13.362
us on this boat.

57:13.462 --> 57:15.264
Look, we get back
to Haven...

57:15.364 --> 57:16.365
- in a few hours' time.
- Oh, yeah.

57:16.465 --> 57:17.733
Hiding under
the Shepherd's skirts...

57:17.833 --> 57:18.835
that's a manful scheme.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.960
- You wanna run this ship?
- Yes.

57:22.038 --> 57:24.038
Well, you can't.

57:24.573 --> 57:26.768
Do a damn sight
better job than you.

57:26.876 --> 57:29.310
Getting us lashed over
a couple of strays.

57:29.545 --> 57:31.514
No offense, Doc. I think
it's noble as a grape...

57:31.614 --> 57:32.815
the way you look to River.

57:32.915 --> 57:35.351
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

57:35.451 --> 57:37.817
Oh, and neither is she
exactly helpless.

57:38.187 --> 57:40.690
So, where's it writ that we got
to lay down our lives for her?

57:40.790 --> 57:42.325
Which is what you've
steered us toward.

57:42.425 --> 57:44.425
I didn't start this.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.760
No, that's right.

57:47.163 --> 57:50.826
Alliance starts the war,
and then you volunteer.

57:52.768 --> 57:54.437
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

57:54.537 --> 57:57.768
Besides Zoe here, how many...
Hey, I'm talking at you.

58:01.811 --> 58:04.837
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

58:08.084 --> 58:10.211
You wanna leave this room.

58:13.055 --> 58:15.055
Damn right, I do.

58:22.131 --> 58:24.156
This isn't the war, Mal.

58:25.034 --> 58:27.236
You telling me that
'cause you think I don't know?

58:27.336 --> 58:29.438
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

58:29.538 --> 58:31.538
I came looking for you.

58:32.742 --> 58:35.210
I just want to know
who I'm dealing with.

58:35.311 --> 58:37.939
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

58:38.180 --> 58:42.446
I start fighting a war, I
guarantee you'll see something new.

58:49.625 --> 58:50.826
We'll get off.

58:50.926 --> 58:52.528
River and I will
get off at Haven.

58:52.628 --> 58:54.363
- We'll find some...
- Nobody's saying that.

58:54.463 --> 58:56.265
Nobody besides Jayne
is saying that.

58:56.365 --> 58:58.365
Mal.

58:59.835 --> 59:02.905
I got no answers for you,
Inara. I got no rudder.

59:03.005 --> 59:05.942
Wind blows northerly, I
go north. That's who I am.

59:06.042 --> 59:08.577
Now, maybe that ain't a man to
lead, but they have to follow.

59:08.677 --> 59:09.745
So you wanna tear me down...

59:09.845 --> 59:11.981
do it inside your own mind.
I'm not trying to tear you down.

59:12.081 --> 59:14.081
But you fog things up.

59:14.483 --> 59:16.483
You always have.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.820
You spin me about.

59:22.458 --> 59:24.619
I wish like hell
you was elsewhere.

59:26.829 --> 59:28.829
I was.

1:01:01.056 --> 1:01:03.320
No trouble,
little crazy person.

1:01:05.327 --> 1:01:08.694
We're going
for a nice shuttle ride.

1:01:26.215 --> 1:01:28.117
She's out. Jayne's down.

1:01:28.217 --> 1:01:30.742
The other way.
Find her and do not engage.

1:01:53.086 --> 1:01:55.086
It's gonna be okay...

1:02:05.165 --> 1:02:07.300
She's sealed off the bridge.
I do not like her there.

1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:09.069
Check the shuttle.
She could have snuck in.

1:02:09.169 --> 1:02:11.169
Captain.

1:02:56.216 --> 1:02:59.117
The government's man,
he says you're a danger to us.

1:03:00.119 --> 1:03:02.119
Not worth helping.

1:03:04.357 --> 1:03:06.357
Is he right?

1:03:06.859 --> 1:03:09.259
Are you anything but a weapon?

1:03:12.432 --> 1:03:15.502
I've staked my crew's life on
the theory you're a person...

1:03:15.602 --> 1:03:18.799
actual and whole, and if I'm
wrong, you'd best shoot me now.

1:03:20.039 --> 1:03:22.039
Or we could talk more.

1:03:32.952 --> 1:03:34.952
Miranda.

1:03:38.157 --> 1:03:40.527
How can it be there's a
whole planet called Miranda...

1:03:40.627 --> 1:03:41.861
and none of us knowed that?

1:03:41.961 --> 1:03:45.328
Because there isn't one. It's
a blackrock. Uninhabitable.

1:03:45.832 --> 1:03:48.868
Terraforming didn't hold, or
some such. Few settlers died.

1:03:48.968 --> 1:03:50.470
Was it right before the war?

1:03:50.570 --> 1:03:54.438
I had to show them. I didn't know
if you were going to make me sleep.

1:03:56.142 --> 1:03:58.211
- You could have asked.
- Wait a tick, yeah.

1:03:58.311 --> 1:04:01.948
Some years back, there was call
for workers to settle on Miranda.

1:04:02.048 --> 1:04:03.783
- Daddy talked about it.
- Nothing about it...

1:04:03.883 --> 1:04:05.885
on the Cortex. History,
Astronomy, it's not in there.

1:04:05.985 --> 1:04:08.288
Half of writing history
is hiding the truth.

1:04:08.388 --> 1:04:11.291
There's something on that rock
the Alliance doesn't want known.

1:04:11.391 --> 1:04:13.560
That's right at the edge of
the Burnham Quadrant, right?

1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:15.962
Furthest planet out?
It's not that far from here.

1:04:16.062 --> 1:04:17.764
- That's a bad notion.
- Whoa. No. No. Honey...

1:04:17.864 --> 1:04:20.230
- ...you show them the bad.
- I got it, baby.

1:04:23.870 --> 1:04:26.532
This is us, at Haven,
and here's Miranda.

1:04:27.106 --> 1:04:31.277
All along here, that empty space
in between, that's Reaver territory.

1:04:31.377 --> 1:04:34.047
They just float out there,
sending out raiding parties.

1:04:34.147 --> 1:04:36.416
Nobody ventures there.
Not even the Alliance.

1:04:36.516 --> 1:04:38.751
You go through that, you're
signing up to be a banquet.

1:04:38.851 --> 1:04:41.454
I'm on board with our standard
run-and-hide scenario.

1:04:41.554 --> 1:04:43.554
And we are just about...

1:04:44.057 --> 1:04:46.057
Wait.

1:05:02.442 --> 1:05:04.569
- Doesn't look like Reavers.
- Wasn't.

1:05:10.416 --> 1:05:12.416
Shepherd?

1:05:13.219 --> 1:05:15.219
Shepherd?

1:05:15.688 --> 1:05:17.688
Shepherd Book?

1:05:38.010 --> 1:05:40.010
Get the Doc.

1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:42.880
Shepherd.

1:05:43.049 --> 1:05:45.916
- Don't move.
- Won't go far.

1:05:48.421 --> 1:05:50.421
Shouldn't have been you.

1:05:51.224 --> 1:05:53.852
Alliance should've hit us.
Should've hit me.

1:05:55.228 --> 1:05:57.228
That crossed my mind.

1:06:01.501 --> 1:06:04.629
- I shot him down.
- Yeah. I see.

1:06:04.871 --> 1:06:07.431
I killed the ship that killed us.

1:06:09.175 --> 1:06:11.175
Not very Christian of me.

1:06:11.611 --> 1:06:13.513
You did what's right.

1:06:13.613 --> 1:06:17.674
Coming from you,
that means almost nothing.

1:06:23.256 --> 1:06:25.792
- I'm long gone.
- No, Doc will bring you around.

1:06:25.892 --> 1:06:28.761
I look to be bored by many
more sermons before you slip.

1:06:28.861 --> 1:06:30.663
Just don't move.

1:06:30.763 --> 1:06:32.763
Can't order me around, boy.

1:06:33.833 --> 1:06:35.833
I'm not one of your crew.

1:06:37.703 --> 1:06:39.703
Yes, you are.

1:06:41.941 --> 1:06:43.941
- River...
- Come on.

1:06:44.243 --> 1:06:46.243
Hey.

1:06:47.013 --> 1:06:50.972
I don't care what you
believe. Just believe it.

1:06:52.652 --> 1:06:54.652
Whatever you...

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:29.945
How come they ain't waiting?

1:07:31.123 --> 1:07:34.092
They knowed we was coming,
how come they only sent one?

1:07:35.228 --> 1:07:37.560
They didn't know
we were coming here.

1:07:38.364 --> 1:07:40.066
Get on the Cortex.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:42.001
Wave Li Shen,
the Sanchez brothers...

1:07:42.101 --> 1:07:45.571
anyone who has ever sheltered us
after a heist. Tell them to get out.

1:07:45.671 --> 1:07:47.671
Get out now.

1:07:58.084 --> 1:08:00.084
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:08:01.387 --> 1:08:05.153
<i>"If your quarry goes to ground,
leave no ground to go to."</i>

1:08:06.292 --> 1:08:08.294
<i>You should have
taken my offer.</i>

1:08:08.394 --> 1:08:10.954
<i>Or did you think none of this
was your fault?</i>

1:08:11.230 --> 1:08:13.230
I don't murder children.

1:08:13.599 --> 1:08:15.435
<i>I do.</i>

1:08:15.535 --> 1:08:17.560
- If I have to.
<i>- Why?</i>

1:08:19.438 --> 1:08:21.599
Do you even know
why they sent you?

1:08:22.375 --> 1:08:24.375
<i>It's not my place to ask.</i>

1:08:25.378 --> 1:08:27.903
<i>I believe in something
greater than myself.</i>

1:08:29.015 --> 1:08:30.950
<i>A better world.</i>

1:08:31.050 --> 1:08:33.050
<i>A world without sin.</i>

1:08:33.419 --> 1:08:35.388
So me and mine
gotta lay down and die...

1:08:35.488 --> 1:08:37.683
so you can live
in your better world?

1:08:38.157 --> 1:08:40.284
<i>I'm not going to live there.</i>

1:08:40.693 --> 1:08:42.261
<i>There's no place
for me there...</i>

1:08:42.361 --> 1:08:44.829
<i>any more than
there is for you, Malcolm.</i>

1:08:44.997 --> 1:08:46.997
<i>I'm a monster.</i>

1:08:47.934 --> 1:08:49.202
<i>What I do is evil.</i>

1:08:49.302 --> 1:08:51.838
<i>I have no illusions about it,
but it must be done.</i>

1:08:51.938 --> 1:08:53.606
Keep talking.

1:08:53.706 --> 1:08:55.741
You're not getting a
location trace off this wave.

1:08:55.841 --> 1:08:59.712
<i>And every minute you keep River
Tam from me, more people will die.</i>

1:08:59.812 --> 1:09:02.303
- You think I care?
<i>- Of course you care.</i>

1:09:03.282 --> 1:09:05.282
<i>You're not a Reaver, Mal.</i>

1:09:05.518 --> 1:09:08.976
<i>You're a human man and you
will never understand how...</i>

1:09:15.261 --> 1:09:17.261
Get these bodies together.

1:09:17.597 --> 1:09:18.865
We got time
for grave digging?

1:09:18.965 --> 1:09:20.433
Zoe, you and Simon
rope them together.

1:09:20.533 --> 1:09:22.869
Five or six. I want them laid
out on the nose of our ship.

1:09:22.969 --> 1:09:24.070
Are you insane?

1:09:24.170 --> 1:09:25.438
I won't desecrate
these bodies.

1:09:25.538 --> 1:09:27.373
I don't understand. What
do you mean, the bodies...

1:09:27.473 --> 1:09:28.875
I want you to muck up
the reactor core.

1:09:28.975 --> 1:09:30.977
Just enough to leave a trail
and make it read like...

1:09:31.077 --> 1:09:33.212
we're flying without
containment, not enough to fry us.

1:09:33.312 --> 1:09:35.081
These people are our friends. Kaylee...

1:09:35.181 --> 1:09:38.014
you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.

1:09:39.051 --> 1:09:43.289
Jayne, you and Wash hoist up the
cannon mount. Goes right on top.

1:09:43.389 --> 1:09:45.024
Piece or two of the
other ship, stick it on.

1:09:45.124 --> 1:09:48.355
Any place you can tear hull
without inner breach, do that, too.

1:09:49.195 --> 1:09:52.460
We're gonna need paint.
We're gonna need red paint.

1:09:52.965 --> 1:09:54.333
Sir...

1:09:54.433 --> 1:09:57.870
do you really mean to turn
our home into an abomination...

1:09:57.970 --> 1:09:59.739
so that we can make
a suicidal attempt...

1:09:59.839 --> 1:10:01.864
at passing through
Reaver space?

1:10:01.974 --> 1:10:03.609
I mean to live.

1:10:03.709 --> 1:10:05.111
I mean for us to live.

1:10:05.211 --> 1:10:07.780
The Alliance won't have that,
so we go where they don't follow.

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:10.016
God's balls, there ain't no
way we're going out there.

1:10:10.116 --> 1:10:11.784
Mal, think about
what you're asking.

1:10:11.884 --> 1:10:14.079
...those Reavers'll
eat us alive...

1:10:15.821 --> 1:10:17.557
This is how it is.

1:10:17.657 --> 1:10:19.325
Anybody doesn't wanna
fly with me anymore...

1:10:19.425 --> 1:10:21.425
this is your port of harbor.

1:10:22.128 --> 1:10:24.130
There's a lot
of fine ways to die.

1:10:24.230 --> 1:10:26.960
I ain't waiting for the
Alliance to choose mine.

1:10:30.536 --> 1:10:31.971
I mean to confound
these bungers.

1:10:32.071 --> 1:10:33.706
Take my shot
at getting to Miranda.

1:10:33.806 --> 1:10:36.375
Maybe find something I can use
to get clear of this.

1:10:36.475 --> 1:10:39.345
So I hear a word out of any of
you that ain't helping me out...

1:10:39.445 --> 1:10:41.936
or taking your leave,
I will shoot you down.

1:10:46.886 --> 1:10:48.886
Get to work.

1:11:13.713 --> 1:11:14.747
Sir...

1:11:14.847 --> 1:11:16.847
Just tell me
when we're close.

1:12:23.883 --> 1:12:25.883
Wash.

1:13:29.515 --> 1:13:32.746
Define "disappeared."

1:13:37.489 --> 1:13:39.753
Every reading
I'm getting says normal.

1:13:40.492 --> 1:13:43.796
Oceans, land masses. No tectonic
instability or radiation.

1:13:43.896 --> 1:13:46.832
- Yeah, but no power, either.
- Nothing at all?

1:13:46.932 --> 1:13:48.501
Wait.

1:13:48.601 --> 1:13:50.601
Something.

1:13:50.769 --> 1:13:53.237
It might be a beacon,
but it's awful weak.

1:13:53.906 --> 1:13:55.906
Find it.

1:14:03.649 --> 1:14:05.649
Gravity's Earthnorm.

1:14:05.951 --> 1:14:08.181
O2 levels check,
pressure...

1:14:08.954 --> 1:14:11.752
If anything's wrong the
scanner's not reading it.

1:14:17.596 --> 1:14:19.996
Well, something sure
the hell ain't right.

1:14:22.935 --> 1:14:24.203
This ain't
no little settlement.

1:14:24.303 --> 1:14:27.101
We flew over at least a
dozen cities just as big.

1:14:27.206 --> 1:14:29.436
Why didn't we ever
hear about this?

1:14:31.443 --> 1:14:33.443
Beacon's up ahead.

1:14:55.901 --> 1:14:57.901
Ho.

1:15:16.956 --> 1:15:19.322
No entry wounds,
fractures.

1:15:19.792 --> 1:15:21.792
Poison?

1:15:33.672 --> 1:15:35.672
Got another one.

1:15:40.846 --> 1:15:42.846
They's just sitting here.

1:15:44.283 --> 1:15:46.283
They didn't crash.

1:16:00.099 --> 1:16:02.099
Kaylee. Don't...

1:16:07.406 --> 1:16:09.636
How come these ones
are preserved?

1:16:10.175 --> 1:16:12.311
Place must've gone hermetic
when the power blew.

1:16:12.411 --> 1:16:15.039
Sealed them.
What are they doing?

1:16:16.248 --> 1:16:18.248
What's everybody doing?

1:16:18.384 --> 1:16:20.852
There's no unusual
discoloration.

1:16:21.420 --> 1:16:24.150
Nobody's doubled over
or showing signs of pain.

1:16:24.590 --> 1:16:26.888
There's gasses
that kill painless, right?

1:16:27.192 --> 1:16:29.592
They didn't fall.
None of them.

1:16:29.995 --> 1:16:31.995
They just lay down.

1:16:35.467 --> 1:16:38.698
Make them stop.
They're everywhere.

1:16:39.638 --> 1:16:41.765
Every city, every...

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:44.944
Every house, every room,
they're all inside me.

1:16:45.044 --> 1:16:48.480
I can hear them all,
and they're saying nothing!

1:16:49.515 --> 1:16:51.515
Get up.

1:16:51.650 --> 1:16:53.650
Please get up.

1:16:57.890 --> 1:17:00.188
Please, God,
make me a stone.

1:17:01.393 --> 1:17:03.228
She is starting
to damage my calm.

1:17:03.328 --> 1:17:05.328
- Jayne.
- She's right!

1:17:05.864 --> 1:17:07.864
Everybody's dead.

1:17:08.967 --> 1:17:11.265
This whole world is dead
for no reason!

1:17:13.705 --> 1:17:15.705
Let's get to the beacon.

1:17:41.633 --> 1:17:43.633
This is the source?

1:17:46.905 --> 1:17:49.135
This ship's banged up
all to hell.

1:18:06.391 --> 1:18:09.189
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.</i>

1:18:10.295 --> 1:18:12.295
<i>And you can see...</i>

1:18:13.532 --> 1:18:15.532
<i>it isn't what we thought.</i>

1:18:16.668 --> 1:18:18.668
<i>There's been no war here...</i>

1:18:19.171 --> 1:18:22.265
<i>and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.</i>

1:18:27.379 --> 1:18:29.379
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1:18:30.315 --> 1:18:34.649
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that
we added to the air processors.</i>

1:18:35.621 --> 1:18:39.352
<i>It was supposed to calm the
population, weed out aggression.</i>

1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:43.460
<i>Well, it works.</i>

1:18:43.996 --> 1:18:46.396
<i>The people here
stopped fighting.</i>

1:18:47.366 --> 1:18:49.994
<i>And then they stopped
everything else.</i>

1:18:54.907 --> 1:18:57.102
<i>They stopped going to work...</i>

1:18:58.010 --> 1:19:02.242
<i>they stopped breeding,
talking, eating.</i>

1:19:04.082 --> 1:19:08.348
<i>There's 30 million people here, and
they all just let themselves die.</i>

1:19:11.423 --> 1:19:13.423
<i>I have to be quick.</i>

1:19:13.959 --> 1:19:15.594
<i>About a tenth
of a percent of...</i>

1:19:15.694 --> 1:19:18.026
<i>the population had the
opposite reaction to the Pax.</i>

1:19:18.664 --> 1:19:22.327
<i>Their aggressor response
increased beyond madness.</i>

1:19:22.801 --> 1:19:24.801
<i>They have become...</i>

1:19:26.338 --> 1:19:28.338
<i>Well, they've killed
most of us.</i>

1:19:29.107 --> 1:19:31.107
<i>And not just killed...</i>

1:19:32.678 --> 1:19:34.678
<i>they've done things.</i>

1:19:34.947 --> 1:19:38.075
Reavers. They made them.

1:19:39.718 --> 1:19:43.848
<i>I won't live to report this,
but people have to know.</i>

1:19:45.123 --> 1:19:47.123
<i>We meant it for the best...</i>

1:19:47.392 --> 1:19:49.392
<i>to make people safer.</i>

1:19:50.562 --> 1:19:53.622
<i>God!</i>

1:19:58.470 --> 1:20:00.470
Turn it off.

1:20:25.030 --> 1:20:27.965
- River.
- I'm all right.

1:20:35.974 --> 1:20:37.974
I'm all right.

1:20:45.684 --> 1:20:48.118
<i>This report is maybe
12 years old.</i>

1:20:49.121 --> 1:20:53.023
Parliament buried it, and it
stayed buried till River dug it up.

1:20:54.626 --> 1:20:57.060
This is what
they feared she knew.

1:20:57.663 --> 1:20:59.663
And they were
right to fear...

1:21:00.098 --> 1:21:03.035
because there's a whole universe
of folk who are gonna know it, too.

1:21:03.135 --> 1:21:05.135
They're gonna see it.

1:21:05.370 --> 1:21:08.066
Somebody has to speak
for these people.

1:21:11.476 --> 1:21:13.812
You all got on this boat
for different reasons...

1:21:13.912 --> 1:21:16.073
but you all come
to the same place.

1:21:16.481 --> 1:21:19.644
So now I'm asking more of you
than I have before.

1:21:20.786 --> 1:21:22.786
Maybe all.

1:21:24.089 --> 1:21:27.286
Sure as I know anything I
know this, they will try again.

1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:31.151
Maybe on another world, maybe
on this very ground swept clean.

1:21:31.263 --> 1:21:34.061
A year from now, 10, they'll
swing back to the belief...

1:21:34.199 --> 1:21:36.292
that they can make people...

1:21:39.037 --> 1:21:41.037
better.

1:21:43.208 --> 1:21:45.233
And I do not hold to that.

1:21:47.546 --> 1:21:49.546
So no more running.

1:21:51.516 --> 1:21:53.516
I aim to misbehave.

1:22:01.026 --> 1:22:03.290
Shepherd Book
used to tell me:

1:22:03.395 --> 1:22:05.454
"If you can't do
something smart...

1:22:06.965 --> 1:22:08.965
"do something right."

1:22:10.035 --> 1:22:12.731
- Do we have a plan?
- Mr. Universe.

1:22:13.338 --> 1:22:15.340
We haven't the equipment
to broadwave this code...

1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:17.908
but he can put it
on every screen for 30 worlds.

1:22:18.543 --> 1:22:20.543
He's pretty damn close, too.

1:22:20.846 --> 1:22:21.913
We still got the Reavers...

1:22:22.013 --> 1:22:24.277
and probably the Alliance,
between us and him.

1:22:24.549 --> 1:22:27.245
That's two armies against
our one bitty cannon.

1:22:27.452 --> 1:22:30.422
It's a fair bet the Alliance
knows about Mr. Universe.

1:22:30.522 --> 1:22:32.522
They're gonna
see this coming.

1:22:33.125 --> 1:22:35.125
No.

1:22:36.194 --> 1:22:38.492
They're not gonna see this coming.

1:22:46.738 --> 1:22:48.738
<i>No problem. Bring it on.
Bring it on. Bring it on.</i>

1:22:49.107 --> 1:22:51.710
<i>From here to the eyes and ears
of the 'verse. That's my motto...</i>

1:22:51.810 --> 1:22:54.179
<i>or it might be,
if I start having a motto.</i>

1:22:54.279 --> 1:22:55.280
We won't be long.

1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:57.349
<i>You're going to get caught
in the ion cloud.</i>

1:22:57.449 --> 1:22:59.051
<i>It'll play merry hob
with your radar...</i>

1:22:59.151 --> 1:23:01.987
<i>but pretty lights and a few miles
after you'll be right in my orbit.</i>

1:23:02.087 --> 1:23:04.289
You'll let us know
if anyone else comes at you?

1:23:04.389 --> 1:23:06.389
You'll be the first.

1:23:12.197 --> 1:23:13.498
There.

1:23:13.598 --> 1:23:15.930
Toss me my 30 coin,
but I got a newswave for you...

1:23:26.011 --> 1:23:29.139
Call in every ship in the quadrant.
We'll meet them in the air.

1:23:30.782 --> 1:23:32.782
Destroy it all.

1:23:59.044 --> 1:24:01.444
<i>Wash, we almost through?</i>

1:24:23.435 --> 1:24:25.435
<i>Now!</i>

1:24:29.975 --> 1:24:31.975
Go! Move!

1:24:51.329 --> 1:24:55.493
- I'm reading activity in the cloud.
- Lock and fire on my command.

1:24:57.636 --> 1:24:59.934
You should have
let me see her, Captain.

1:25:01.072 --> 1:25:04.872
We should have done this
as men. Not with fire.

1:25:05.277 --> 1:25:07.277
Sir.

1:25:11.683 --> 1:25:13.683
Vessel in range.
Lock on.

1:25:21.359 --> 1:25:23.359
Bastard's not even
changing course.

1:25:28.433 --> 1:25:30.433
Sir!

1:25:33.038 --> 1:25:36.107
Target the Reavers.
Target the Reavers!

1:25:36.207 --> 1:25:38.505
Target everyone!
Somebody fire!

1:25:56.061 --> 1:26:00.361
I am a leaf on the wind.
Watch how I soar.

1:26:14.813 --> 1:26:16.813
Chicken's come home
to roost.

1:26:17.949 --> 1:26:20.042
- The hell?
- It's okay.

1:26:20.285 --> 1:26:22.583
- I am a leaf on the wind!
- What does that mean?

1:26:26.825 --> 1:26:28.825
We're almost through.

1:26:44.976 --> 1:26:47.410
- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

1:27:40.398 --> 1:27:42.398
We're not alone.

1:27:49.474 --> 1:27:50.508
EMP!

1:27:50.608 --> 1:27:52.344
Everybody, strap yourselves
into something!

1:27:52.444 --> 1:27:54.444
- Jayne.
- Got it.

1:27:54.779 --> 1:27:56.779
Kaylee, come on.

1:28:09.294 --> 1:28:11.694
- We're fried. I got no control.
- Where's the backup?

1:28:12.263 --> 1:28:14.288
Where's the backup?

1:28:21.673 --> 1:28:23.673
Check! Check!

1:28:47.799 --> 1:28:48.800
Get up!

1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:50.900
Stop it!

1:28:55.306 --> 1:28:57.375
Backup reads at 20%.
Can you get us down?

1:28:57.475 --> 1:29:00.535
- I'm going to have to glide her in.
- Will that work?

1:29:55.333 --> 1:29:57.333
I am a leaf on the wind.

1:29:59.437 --> 1:30:01.437
Watch how...

1:30:03.341 --> 1:30:07.779
Wash, baby. Baby, no. Baby,
come on. You gotta go. Come on.

1:30:07.879 --> 1:30:11.542
We gotta move. Baby, please.
We gotta move, baby, come on.

1:30:14.886 --> 1:30:16.886
Zoe!

1:30:17.121 --> 1:30:19.121
Move out! Now!

1:30:22.927 --> 1:30:24.529
Go. Go.

1:30:24.629 --> 1:30:26.629
Head inside!

1:30:45.016 --> 1:30:47.016
Jayne, rear guard.

1:30:54.259 --> 1:30:56.420
- Zoe, what've we got?
- Sir...

1:30:58.429 --> 1:30:59.931
this is a good hold point.

1:31:00.031 --> 1:31:01.633
- We all stay together.
- No.

1:31:01.733 --> 1:31:02.901
They have to come
through here.

1:31:03.001 --> 1:31:04.936
They'll bottleneck,
we can thin them out.

1:31:05.036 --> 1:31:07.800
We get pushed back,
there's the blast doors.

1:31:07.939 --> 1:31:10.237
I can rig them so they
won't reopen once they close.

1:31:10.341 --> 1:31:11.342
Shut them
and hide until I get...

1:31:11.442 --> 1:31:13.442
We need to draw them
till it's done.

1:31:14.545 --> 1:31:16.911
This is the place.
We'll buy you the time.

1:31:21.786 --> 1:31:24.189
All right, let's move those
crates back there for cover.

1:31:24.289 --> 1:31:26.757
Make sure they ain't filled
with nothing goes boom.

1:31:27.091 --> 1:31:29.150
Wait, Wash!
Where's Wash?

1:31:30.261 --> 1:31:32.261
He ain't coming.

1:31:37.001 --> 1:31:39.060
Move the gorramn crates!

1:31:56.754 --> 1:31:59.245
Tell me you brought them
this time.

1:32:21.946 --> 1:32:23.946
Zoe?

1:32:25.416 --> 1:32:28.010
- Are you here?
- Do the job, sir.

1:32:30.588 --> 1:32:33.216
You hold.
Hold till I get back.

1:32:37.295 --> 1:32:38.329
Captain's right.

1:32:38.429 --> 1:32:41.432
Can't be thinking on revenge
if we're gonna get through this.

1:32:41.532 --> 1:32:44.160
Do you really think any of
us are gonna get through this?

1:32:47.739 --> 1:32:49.739
I might.

1:33:05.823 --> 1:33:07.823
No.

1:33:28.379 --> 1:33:30.148
<i>Mal.</i>

1:33:30.248 --> 1:33:32.248
<i>Guy killed me, Mal.</i>

1:33:32.350 --> 1:33:35.547
<i>He killed me with a sword.
How weird is that?</i>

1:33:36.454 --> 1:33:40.356
<i>I got a short span here.</i>

1:33:41.826 --> 1:33:43.826
<i>They destroyed my equipment...</i>

1:33:43.928 --> 1:33:45.463
<i>but I have a backup unit.</i>

1:33:45.563 --> 1:33:47.963
<i>Bottom of the complex,
right over the generator.</i>

1:33:48.433 --> 1:33:51.561
<i>Hard to get to.
I know they missed it.</i>

1:33:52.370 --> 1:33:54.600
<i>They can't stop
the signal, Mal.</i>

1:33:55.473 --> 1:33:57.873
<i>They can never
stop the signal.</i>

1:34:02.113 --> 1:34:04.449
The Reavers.
They are all made up of rage.

1:34:04.549 --> 1:34:07.347
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't shut them up.

1:34:11.155 --> 1:34:12.757
Stay low.

1:34:12.857 --> 1:34:16.315
She picked a sweet bung of
a time to go helpless on us.

1:34:17.528 --> 1:34:18.629
Jayne and I take
the first wave.

1:34:18.729 --> 1:34:21.254
Nobody shoots unless
they get past our fire.

1:34:25.103 --> 1:34:27.731
I didn't plan
on going out like this.

1:34:29.574 --> 1:34:31.769
I think we did right, but...

1:34:32.844 --> 1:34:37.110
No. I never planned...
anything.

1:34:39.117 --> 1:34:41.312
I just wanted
to keep River safe.

1:34:45.056 --> 1:34:48.719
Spent so much time on Serenity
ignoring anything...

1:34:49.694 --> 1:34:52.185
that I wanted for myself.

1:34:56.934 --> 1:34:59.334
My one regret
in all of this...

1:35:00.638 --> 1:35:02.638
is never being with you.

1:35:04.442 --> 1:35:06.442
With me?

1:35:07.578 --> 1:35:09.578
You mean to say, as...

1:35:11.516 --> 1:35:13.516
Sex?

1:35:14.886 --> 1:35:16.886
I mean to say.

1:35:21.659 --> 1:35:24.787
Hell with this.
I'm gonna live.

1:35:38.709 --> 1:35:42.076
<i>Mal. Guy killed me, Mal.</i>

1:35:43.181 --> 1:35:45.181
<i>He killed me with a sword.</i>

1:36:23.554 --> 1:36:25.554
"Hard to get to."

1:36:26.424 --> 1:36:28.424
That's a fact.

1:36:35.399 --> 1:36:37.399
Zoe, gorrammit!

1:36:52.783 --> 1:36:55.115
Zoe, get your ass
back on the line!

1:37:11.602 --> 1:37:13.602
You shot me in the back!

1:37:14.972 --> 1:37:17.375
I haven't made you
angry, have I?

1:37:17.475 --> 1:37:20.611
There are a lot of innocent people
in the air being killed right now.

1:37:20.711 --> 1:37:23.145
You have no idea
how true that is.

1:37:24.582 --> 1:37:26.582
I know the secret.

1:37:27.018 --> 1:37:29.486
The truth that burned up
River Tam's brain.

1:37:30.254 --> 1:37:34.315
Rest of the 'verse is going to
know it, too. 'Cause they need to.

1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:39.593
- Do you really believe that?
- I do.

1:37:39.997 --> 1:37:42.124
You willing to die
for that belief?

1:37:44.535 --> 1:37:46.535
I am.

1:37:52.510 --> 1:37:54.569
Of course,
that ain't exactly Plan A.

1:38:21.205 --> 1:38:23.332
Spine's intact.
Just give me a bandage.

1:39:16.994 --> 1:39:18.994
Up high, left!

1:39:26.170 --> 1:39:28.170
Kaylee!

1:39:40.251 --> 1:39:44.187
Fall back! Everybody,
fall back! Fall back now!

1:39:53.798 --> 1:39:55.798
Jayne, grenade.

1:39:56.434 --> 1:39:58.629
Very last one.

1:40:04.675 --> 1:40:06.010
They're gonna get in.

1:40:06.110 --> 1:40:08.806
I can close it
from the outside.

1:40:09.213 --> 1:40:11.213
No one's coming
back from that.

1:40:14.218 --> 1:40:16.153
How much ammo
do we have?

1:40:16.253 --> 1:40:20.124
Three, four max, and my
swinging cod. That's all.

1:40:20.224 --> 1:40:21.225
The lift isn't moving.

1:40:21.325 --> 1:40:23.761
When they come, try to
plug the hole with it.

1:40:23.861 --> 1:40:26.263
I'm starting to lose
some feeling here.

1:40:26.363 --> 1:40:29.059
Lie still. I'm going
to give you something...

1:40:31.101 --> 1:40:33.101
My bag.

1:40:42.413 --> 1:40:44.413
Keep pressure here.

1:40:45.716 --> 1:40:47.151
My bag.

1:40:47.251 --> 1:40:48.986
I need...

1:40:49.086 --> 1:40:52.544
adrenaline and a shot of...

1:40:53.057 --> 1:40:55.057
calaphar for Kaylee.

1:40:57.361 --> 1:40:59.361
I can't.

1:41:02.933 --> 1:41:04.933
River.

1:41:09.006 --> 1:41:11.702
- River, I'm sorry.
- No.

1:41:13.077 --> 1:41:15.077
No.

1:41:21.385 --> 1:41:23.615
- I hate to leave.
- You won't.

1:41:26.557 --> 1:41:29.151
You take care of me, Simon.

1:41:32.229 --> 1:41:34.857
You've always
taken care of me.

1:41:40.204 --> 1:41:42.204
My turn.

1:42:36.226 --> 1:42:38.854
Do you know
what your sin is, Mal?

1:42:39.430 --> 1:42:42.797
Hell. I'm a fan
of all seven.

1:42:49.340 --> 1:42:51.340
But right now...

1:42:52.176 --> 1:42:54.176
I'm going to have
to go with wrath.

1:42:58.616 --> 1:43:01.084
We ain't got long.

1:43:07.124 --> 1:43:09.124
You suppose he got through?

1:43:10.260 --> 1:43:12.260
Do you think Mal
got the word out?

1:43:12.896 --> 1:43:17.299
He got through.
I know he got through.

1:43:28.579 --> 1:43:30.579
I'm sorry.

1:43:32.883 --> 1:43:35.681
You should know
there's no shame in this.

1:43:37.855 --> 1:43:39.982
You've done remarkable things.

1:43:41.225 --> 1:43:43.420
But you're fighting a war...

1:43:44.628 --> 1:43:46.628
you've already lost.

1:43:50.668 --> 1:43:52.668
Well, I'm known for that.

1:44:01.478 --> 1:44:05.107
Piece of shrapnel tore up that
nerve cluster my first tour.

1:44:05.683 --> 1:44:07.683
Had it moved.

1:44:08.619 --> 1:44:10.554
Sorry about the throat.

1:44:10.654 --> 1:44:13.487
Expect you'd want to say your
famous last words right now.

1:44:14.558 --> 1:44:16.558
Just one trouble.

1:44:20.864 --> 1:44:22.864
I ain't gonna kill you.

1:44:25.836 --> 1:44:28.930
Hell, I'm gonna grant
your greatest wish.

1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.113
I'm gonna show you
a world without sin.

1:44:44.955 --> 1:44:46.991
<i>These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.</i>

1:44:47.091 --> 1:44:49.091
<i>And you can see...</i>

1:44:50.994 --> 1:44:53.155
<i>it isn't what we thought.</i>

1:44:54.865 --> 1:44:56.865
<i>There's been no war here...</i>

1:44:57.434 --> 1:45:01.700
<i>and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.</i>

1:45:03.373 --> 1:45:05.373
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1:45:06.810 --> 1:45:11.144
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that
we added to the air processors.</i>

1:45:11.849 --> 1:45:14.443
<i>It was supposed to calm
the population...</i>

1:45:43.046 --> 1:45:45.046
<i>We meant it for the best...</i>

1:45:45.616 --> 1:45:47.616
<i>to make people safer.</i>

1:45:48.952 --> 1:45:50.952
<i>God!</i>

1:46:13.110 --> 1:46:15.578
- Sir?
- It's done.

1:46:18.749 --> 1:46:20.749
Report.

1:46:22.252 --> 1:46:24.252
River?

1:46:48.979 --> 1:46:49.947
Drop your weapons!

1:46:50.047 --> 1:46:51.048
Do it now.

1:46:51.148 --> 1:46:52.583
Weapons down.
Let it down, now.

1:46:52.683 --> 1:46:54.251
I want to see
your hands in the air.

1:46:54.351 --> 1:46:56.351
Stand down.
Do it.

1:47:01.692 --> 1:47:03.127
Targets are acquired.

1:47:03.227 --> 1:47:05.227
<i>Do we have a kill order?</i>

1:47:07.598 --> 1:47:09.598
<i>Do we have an order?</i>

1:47:17.507 --> 1:47:19.507
<i>Stand down.</i>

1:47:19.910 --> 1:47:22.674
<i>Stand down. It's finished.</i>

1:47:26.450 --> 1:47:28.450
<i>We're finished.</i>

1:49:30.207 --> 1:49:32.207
It's not over,
you know.

1:49:33.777 --> 1:49:36.473
I can't guarantee that
they won't come after you.

1:49:37.314 --> 1:49:39.082
The Parliament.

1:49:39.182 --> 1:49:42.152
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1:49:42.252 --> 1:49:46.621
They are not gone
and they are not...forgiving.

1:49:47.190 --> 1:49:49.658
That don't bode
especially well for you...

1:49:50.394 --> 1:49:53.420
giving the order to let us go,
patching up our hurt.

1:49:54.798 --> 1:49:58.234
I told them the Tams were no
longer a threat, damage done.

1:49:58.769 --> 1:50:00.769
They might listen...

1:50:01.038 --> 1:50:04.439
but I think they know
I'm no longer their man.

1:50:06.209 --> 1:50:09.303
They take you down, I don't
expect to grieve over much.

1:50:11.548 --> 1:50:13.982
Like to kill you myself,
I see you again.

1:50:14.818 --> 1:50:16.818
You won't.

1:50:18.755 --> 1:50:20.950
There is nothing left to see.

1:50:26.663 --> 1:50:28.498
Sir, we have
a green light.

1:50:28.598 --> 1:50:30.828
Inspection's pos and
we're clear for up-thrust.

1:50:37.340 --> 1:50:39.433
Think she'll hold together?

1:50:40.444 --> 1:50:43.072
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1:50:47.384 --> 1:50:49.614
Make sure
everything's secure.

1:50:51.488 --> 1:50:54.389
- Could be bumpy.
- Always is.

1:51:01.798 --> 1:51:02.799
Taking her out...

1:51:02.899 --> 1:51:05.435
should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1:51:05.535 --> 1:51:07.535
Right.

1:51:08.105 --> 1:51:10.307
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1:51:10.407 --> 1:51:12.407
I, uh...

1:51:16.179 --> 1:51:18.179
I don't know.

1:51:19.549 --> 1:51:21.549
Good answer.

1:51:45.942 --> 1:51:48.467
So, you gonna ride shotgun
with me, help me fly?

1:51:48.712 --> 1:51:50.514
That's the plan.

1:51:50.614 --> 1:51:52.614
Think you can work out...

1:51:59.823 --> 1:52:01.823
Okay.

1:52:02.192 --> 1:52:05.320
Clearly some
aptitude for the...

1:52:06.830 --> 1:52:09.355
It ain't all buttons
and charts, little albatross.

1:52:09.799 --> 1:52:11.926
You know what the first rule
of flying is?

1:52:12.435 --> 1:52:15.427
Well, I suppose you do, since you
already know what I'm about to say.

1:52:16.473 --> 1:52:18.473
I do.

1:52:19.109 --> 1:52:21.109
But I like to hear you say it.

1:52:25.649 --> 1:52:26.883
Love.

1:52:26.983 --> 1:52:28.852
You can learn all the math
in the 'verse...

1:52:28.952 --> 1:52:30.954
but you take a boat in
the air that you don't love...

1:52:31.054 --> 1:52:33.921
she'll shake you off just as
sure as the turn of the worlds.

1:52:37.260 --> 1:52:39.956
Love keeps her in the air
when she ought to fall down...

1:52:41.431 --> 1:52:43.763
tells you she's hurting
before she keels.

1:52:46.570 --> 1:52:48.570
Makes her a home.

1:52:53.376 --> 1:52:55.376
Storm's getting worse.

1:52:57.547 --> 1:53:00.243
We'll pass through it
soon enough.

1:53:21.338 --> 1:53:23.338
<i>What was that?</i>
