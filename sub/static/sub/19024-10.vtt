WEBVTT

00:06.320 --> 00:08.117
Hey, how you doing?

00:08.200 --> 00:10.794
I know we put on
a hell of a show, but, dude,

00:10.880 --> 00:12.711
put some shades on or somethin'.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.597
Don't make a big deal out of this.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.636
When was the last time
you got laid?

00:16.720 --> 00:19.518
OK, just subtly take
the spotlight off yourself.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.512
Once on a red-eye flight,
Turk groped a transsexual.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.070
Baby, it was dark, and he/she
had a body that was rockin'.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.434
Mission accomplished.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.715
We're talking about you now, studly.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.234
OK, so I'm in a bit of a dry spell.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.311
I have no idea
what to do with myself.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.550
Why not give Rowdy a bath?
He smells ripe.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.552
Please. I'm a young, single
player with a heart of gold.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.631
I should be able
to stir something up.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.716
How do you get so dirty?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.279
Rowdy.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.032
I'm not the only one in a rut.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.429
- My life is a mess.
- At least you're pretty.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.239
- Pretty don't pay the rent.
- It does for my sister.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.117
Your sister's a prostitute?

00:57.200 --> 01:00.590
She's a model. Come on, we talked
about thinking before we speak.

01:00.680 --> 01:01.874
I was just frazzled.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.837
I stopped taking my dad's money,
I can't pay the bills,

01:04.920 --> 01:07.673
I'm getting kicked out,
and thanks to this hospital,

01:07.760 --> 01:09.910
I haven't had time
to look for a new place.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.798
Sometimes the hospital
seems like a hungry monster

01:12.880 --> 01:14.677
that feeds on our personal lives.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.037
It affects all of us.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.918
- Morning, Dr Cox.
- Denise. I know it's morning.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.072
If it was last night I'd still
be with my pregnant ex-wife

01:27.160 --> 01:30.914
trying to get her to calm down
because, believe it or not,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.639
I managed to forget
to bring home the curly fries.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.235
Do you see where I'm going here?
Yes, no, maybe so?

01:37.320 --> 01:39.231
Talk to her.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.840
The man's got troubles.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.593
You're one of the cutest doctors
I've ever met.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.750
Give me a kiss.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.309
Well, put it in your pocket
and save it for later.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.518
The monster kills everyhing
that's beautiful. Everyhing.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.476
Except Lisa, the gift-shop girl.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.790
Boys, remember now,
when we get upstairs

02:04.880 --> 02:07.189
it's the trauma ward,
not the drama ward,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.350
so smiles, everyone, smiles.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.035
Whatever. Dry spell,
prepare to be moistened.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.111
Hey, Lisa, how you doing?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.952
JD, I can't give you free gum.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.838
I was thinking,
you're probably one of those girls

02:19.920 --> 02:22.992
that's so pretty that no one
has the courage to ask you out.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.877
No, I get asked out
all the time.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.430
OK, momentary setback.
Regroup. Regroup!

02:28.520 --> 02:31.193
Hey, go out with me.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.872
It's the right thing to do.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.751
Sure. Why not?

02:40.280 --> 02:42.510
Very funny,
you dumb choir punks.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.431
Santa's a drunk.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.670
Where were we?

02:46.760 --> 02:48.637
So what did you have in mind?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.870
I could think
of a couple of things.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.876
- How does he get so dirty?
- Who the hell cares?

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.760 --> 03:14.557
- I'll see you tonight.
- OK. Bye.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.871
- Nice to meet you, Turk.
- A pleasure meeting you, Lisa.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.712
Yeah, Gift-Shop Girl.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.519
- Player
- Hold me down

03:24.600 --> 03:26.795
- Know what I'm saying?
- Hey, look at me.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.189
Turn Gift-Shop Girl
into Gift-Shop Woman.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.317
I swear on all the gifts in her shop,
I will make you proud.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.870
That's my dog. That's my dog!

03:40.840 --> 03:42.910
Come to Papa.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.275
The coil didn't complete
its revolution.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.716
My candy's just hanging there
instead of dropping.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.234
OK, whatever.
Look, if you're hungry, man,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.914
- I can loan you a buck.
- A buck?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.357
What a kind offer
from the charitable Dr Money Bags.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.396
You can either be a jerk as usual,

04:02.480 --> 04:04.471
or you can accept
this gracious offer

04:04.560 --> 04:07.233
and get some caramel
draped in nougat.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.470
Your choice, jumpsuit.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.509
Jordan, I have to tell you,
despite how crazy hormonal you are,

04:14.600 --> 04:18.673
there is something about a pregnant
woman that's almost spiritual.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.478
- Really?
- Honestly, you...

04:20.560 --> 04:22.471
You have never looked
so beautiful.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.233
- It's the giant boobs.
- Have you seen them lately?

04:25.320 --> 04:26.912
Yes. Relax.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.639
I've seen bigger.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.393
No, not you. Although, kudos.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.879
Mm-hmm.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.394
- You know what I hate?
- So many things.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.109
That's true. I stay at your house
every night and then in the morning

04:40.200 --> 04:42.998
I've gotta drive back
to my apartment to get ready

04:43.080 --> 04:45.548
and then back here
to go to board meetings.

04:45.640 --> 04:49.952
Then just leave your boobs
and some other stuff at my place.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.429
- Really?
- Yeah, if it saves you the hassle.

04:52.520 --> 04:56.832
- Bring it on.
- Well, great. See you tonight.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.797
It appears
Mrs Watson has developed

04:58.880 --> 05:01.519
a post-op infection
at her thyroidectomy site.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.595
Newbie, when a patient
has an infection,

05:04.680 --> 05:07.558
I make it a general policy
not to actually push on it.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.835
Start Ancef,
one gram Q eight hours and...

05:09.920 --> 05:12.912
Oh, my God, did I just ask
my ex-wife to move in with me?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.119
What? You don't own that.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.998
Turk, come help me wrap presents.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.469
Baby, do you realize
how long it's been

05:22.560 --> 05:25.358
since we've had an afternoon off,
just the two of us?

05:25.440 --> 05:26.919
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.070
I should give you
a sensual massage,

05:29.160 --> 05:34.188
rub your feet a little,
and maybe, if you're interested,

05:34.280 --> 05:36.555
sex you up and whatnot.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.796
- Come here.
- I'll get the TV.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.155
No, you know what? Leave it on.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.435
I know how much you like
The Jeffersons.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.988
Baby, you're a gift from God.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.150
Here come Daddy!

05:52.160 --> 05:53.752
I'm gonna rock your world!

06:05.760 --> 06:09.435
Turk, the show's starting.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.751
Ha! I put those flyers up
and nobody wants me to live with them.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.274
Come on, I'm sure
you'll find a roommate

06:15.360 --> 06:17.555
who's a "clean,
non-smoking vegetarian

06:17.640 --> 06:20.518
that rinses the shower
thoroughly after each usage."

06:20.600 --> 06:22.238
If you don't, it gets mildewy.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.914
You should move in
with my friend, Anal McLooney.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.389
I had to move out
of my apartment this morning.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.072
My stuff is outside in a truck.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.515
Why not crash with us
until you find a place?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.910
I'm so tired of everyone always
thinking I need to be rescued.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.592
- OK, JD?
- Fine.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.114
Can anyone tell me
the bacterial aetiology

06:39.200 --> 06:41.077
of toxic shock syndrome?

06:41.160 --> 06:42.559
I beg your pardon.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.677
So many doctors standing around,
I assumed it was rounds.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.355
You were looking at the wall,
so that means it's an art exhibit.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.194
When does the gay gentleman come round
with the tray of champagne?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.236
Sir, my father cut me off...

06:55.320 --> 06:58.312
Dr Reid, this is not
bring-your-problems-to-work day.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.675
This is just work day.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.193
But, sir, only one person
took a phone number so far.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.352
Someone's getting a late-night,
drunk call from the Todd.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.237
- Lucky girl.
- Yeah.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.556
All right, Mrs Carlson,
the surgeon

07:14.640 --> 07:17.108
that's coming to do
your lymph node dissection

07:17.200 --> 07:19.919
is a handsome young man,
so don't forget about me.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.514
- I'm serious, you naughty girl.
- Sure, Jordan.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.795
You could take over
the master bathroom.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.553
But do me a favour
and leave my sleeping pills out

07:27.640 --> 07:31.599
in case when I get home
I wanna take 300 of 'em? OK, bye.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.275
I can't stop obsessing about this date.
What do you think I should do?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.954
You should go ahead
and thank your lucky stars

07:38.040 --> 07:41.271
you finally found a gal
who's into same-sex relationships.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.078
- You know, Perry...
- Perry?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.515
I'm trying it out.
I find with the ladies,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.637
if you're clear with your
intentions right off the bat,

07:48.720 --> 07:50.517
they just fall into place.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.999
- AQ?
- What?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.799
It's a new expression.
It means "any questions?"

07:54.880 --> 07:57.917
Don't think I'm impressed
because you managed to score

07:58.000 --> 08:00.753
a sympathy date with whatever
homely looking chick

08:00.840 --> 08:02.831
is managing
the gift shop nowadays.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.512
JD, you ready to go?

08:04.600 --> 08:07.319
Oh, yeah, the word
you're looking for is "wow."

08:07.400 --> 08:10.676
and the words I'm looking for
are "in your face."

08:10.760 --> 08:12.591
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's get going.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.592
PO. Peace out.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.671
Jordan, if you're feeling like crap,

08:17.760 --> 08:22.356
then I'll come straight home...
Of course, with the food.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.637
No, I don't necessarily know
if there is anything bigger

08:25.720 --> 08:28.678
than a Super Size,
but I'll ask the guy...

08:28.760 --> 08:30.910
- Get two Super Sizes.
- Oh, my God.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.634
Oh, hell, yeah.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.553
- Did I fall asleep?
- Yes.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.313
Was that before or after
I rocked your world?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.994
He's a good man. He's a good man.
He's a good man.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.719
You know I get nervous
when you start chanting.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.995
Turk, what happened
to all my stuff?

08:48.080 --> 08:51.959
The massage, the bath, the feet?
I let you watch The Jeffersons.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.996
Baby, I was just
exhausted from work.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.152
When you were an intern,
you were exhausted from work,

08:57.240 --> 08:59.231
but you always made
time for romance.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.915
That's cos I was still trying
to get into your delicates.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.989
Oh, my God.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.032
Dr Reid?
What are you doing in here?

09:14.080 --> 09:18.039
Hi, Dr Kelso. I was just...
I was on call.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.111
Well, I have
the call sheet right here

09:20.200 --> 09:22.998
and your name
doesn't seem to be on it.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.672
But what do I know?

09:24.760 --> 09:27.797
I'm just a kindly old man
who doesn't know the difference

09:27.880 --> 09:29.472
between a doctor on call

09:29.560 --> 09:33.838
and one who maybe
just needs a warm bed for the night.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.751
I've just been
so swamped with work

09:35.840 --> 09:38.274
I couldn't even make time
to find a new place.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.114
I understand.
Life is hard and all that.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.715
But if you want
a bed in my hospital,

09:45.800 --> 09:49.952
you better have a damn rent check
or a massive coronary

09:50.040 --> 09:51.996
in the next five seconds.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.550
And believe me, missy,
either one's fine with me.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.996
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.196
I had a really
good time tonight.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.114
I was nervous when you spent
five minutes talking through a napkin.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.351
That wasn't me. That was Nappy,
the ice-breaking puppet.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.635
That little guy earned
his money tonight.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.678
- So you think you're in, huh?
- Come on, I am so in.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.638
- You can't be sure.
- I feel pretty good about it.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.234
- You want me.
- I don't.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.788
Yeah, I'm a doctor.
All the symptoms are there.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.472
You do.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.471
Just kiss me.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.998
Whoa. You know,
I thought I had to sneeze,

10:32.080 --> 10:34.036
but it was a false alarm.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.350
- Let's do this.
- OK.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.595
You know what it is?
It's like a tickling.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.353
I got this, like, weird...
It's a flutter.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.795
Nappy? Stop fooling around and...

10:45.880 --> 10:48.872
Give me a kiss.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.997
I guess you never know
how the monster's gonna attack.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.470
Sometimes it makes you so tired
of taking care of people at work,

10:55.560 --> 10:58.711
you can't bear the thought
of taking care of someone at home.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.032
All right, we need to talk about this.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.792
Sometimes it pulls you away
at the absolute worst time.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.757
Babe, I'm sorry.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.357
Sometimes it even takes
the roof over your head.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.749
And sometimes
the monster takes something

11:22.840 --> 11:25.991
you never thought
you could lose.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.396
Like your mojo.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.711
Is that a roll of quarters
or are you just having a good time?

11:34.800 --> 11:39.430
Actually, it's a roll of quarters.
It's laundry day.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.431
See ya.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.109
So, Little JD
isn't rising to the occasion.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.873
It's not a big deal.
Nobody knows about this but me.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.633
- Newbie, what's up?
- Everything's up.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.438
Rise and shine, sport.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.351
What, did someone
send out a flyer?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.032
Hey, JD. How's your penis?

12:11.120 --> 12:13.509
Calm down.
He says that to everyone.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.556
Hey, Goldman. How's your penis?

12:15.640 --> 12:19.030
You're freaking out.
Just keep your head down and move.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.474
I get it.
I haven't paid you back,

12:22.560 --> 12:24.790
- so you won't even look at me.
- No.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.316
It's been one day,
you greedy little bastard.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.391
See what you did?

12:30.480 --> 12:33.472
Dr Reid,
your truck is double-parked.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.876
Luckily, I had a friend
I could talk to about anything.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.509
T urk, do you ever have any trouble
getting your manhood going?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.592
- Hells, no.
- Yeah! Me, neither, dog.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.471
Apparently I'm the only one
here with women problems.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.519
Listen, Perry, shockingly, I'm not
looking to make the permanent move

12:56.600 --> 12:59.273
to your bachelor cave
over at Swingers T owers.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.715
You made a kind gesture
and I made the mistake

13:01.800 --> 13:05.236
of thinking you could follow
through with it. Do you get it?

13:05.320 --> 13:06.992
You don't get it, do you?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.389
We've been together
for a year and a half.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.916
The romance can't be gone yet.
Does this make any sense to you?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.639
Cos it doesn't to me.
One minute we're clicking,

13:15.720 --> 13:18.837
and the next you're running
for your life. What's going on?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.434
I know we seem insensitive,
but in the crunch,

13:21.520 --> 13:24.114
most guys are smart enough
to say the right thing.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.033
Baby, you have got to chill.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.829
I'm sorry.
Crazy person says what?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.717
- What?
- Thatta girl.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.634
Sometimes the worst thing
a guy can say is nothing at all.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.632
You know what? Forget it.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.592
Dr Reid.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.956
I have no reading material
for my daily, post-lunch...

13:48.040 --> 13:50.395
well, let's just call it
"reading session."

13:50.480 --> 13:52.710
I need your research proposal

13:52.800 --> 13:55.030
or a Vanity Fair,
if you have one.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.680
If I could just get
a little more time on that...

13:57.760 --> 14:01.389
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm fresh
out of special treatment today.

14:01.480 --> 14:06.315
I used it all trying not to stare
at that albino doctor down in radiology.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.639
Don't let him get to you. Just keep
saying positive things to yourself.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.029
It's too much.
I'm just one person.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.951
Thatta girl.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.031
Sometimes I get
so jealous of Turk.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.429
We're residents now
and we're so swamped,

14:20.520 --> 14:22.351
and he just
never seems to show it.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.716
I guess you pick up the slack
when he doesn't have the energy.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.234
Yeah, you would think so.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.879
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- Nah, it's just Todd.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.157
He's called four times to ask
if I want to move into his pants.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.599
You never expect a cliché
to be an actual conversation starter.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.399
- Women, huh?
- T ell me about it.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.596
It's like they're from another planet.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.274
OK, I'm going to engage
you two in a conversation.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.032
You will speak of it to no one.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.439
- Agreed?
- OK.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.671
It has gotten to the point
where I'm going back in my head

14:59.760 --> 15:01.591
over all my old relationships.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.477
I'm not going to sit here

15:03.560 --> 15:06.313
and count up all the women
I've ever slept with.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.389
- Twelve.
- Nine.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.278
Eighteen. But none of them
really understood me.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.397
I consider myself a romantic guy
who's stressed out.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.358
I thought the person
who'd understand would be Carla.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.113
The weird thing
is that I'm trying this time.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.509
I just wonder
if I'm what she really wants.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.593
I wonder if I'll ever be able
to make it work out with anyone.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.955
My peep's on the fritz.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.156
Dude!

15:30.240 --> 15:32.071
- Poor Newbie.
- No.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.391
I'm talking about you guys.
You guys are like my peeps,

15:35.480 --> 15:37.550
you're my dogs,
and you're on the fritz,

15:37.640 --> 15:40.393
so that's where I get "peeps",
"fritz" came from.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.074
God love you, Newbie.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.436
Thank you for giving me
some perspective.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.071
There's your stupid dollar.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.755
And by the way, your new nickname
is Pee Pee La Fritz.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.751
Enjoy.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.236
- Hey.
- Is this where you're sleeping tonight?

16:14.320 --> 16:19.155
Yeah. So? It's cosy.
Hospital adjacent.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.356
Elliot, come on, this is crazy.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.557
You're living out of a van,
like a hobo or...

16:24.640 --> 16:28.030
- Jewel.
- Her poetry changed my life.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.998
I know you wanna show you can
stand on your own two feet,

16:31.080 --> 16:33.913
but you don't have
to prove anything to me.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.036
Come on, come stay
with me and Turk.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.478
What'd you page me
to the roof for?

16:42.560 --> 16:46.473
Well, I was thinking
that you work so hard,

16:46.560 --> 16:49.677
and that if I want
surprise and romance

16:49.760 --> 16:53.912
that maybe it's my turn
to be the one who brings it.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.551
So I brought us
a couple of salads.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.837
- That's great.
- A box of 36 hot wings.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.956
Now, that's what I'm talking 'bout.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.758
And some blue-cheese dressing.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.435
I love this woman!

17:09.520 --> 17:11.317
I guess, in the end,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.356
the monster's always
gonna be there.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.435
The trick is to not let it beat you.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.396
Curly fries?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.392
And sometimes that means
letting a friend help you out.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.029
- Thanks again, JD.
- Don't sweat it.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.510
- Well, have a good night.
- You too.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.830
As for me, I just have
to hope that my problem

17:39.920 --> 17:42.070
will eventually work itself out.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.189
Merry Christmas.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.350
This is exactly what I wanted.
