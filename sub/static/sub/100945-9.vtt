WEBVTT

00:19.227 --> 00:22.480
<i>I could not be prouder</i>
<i>of these brave men and women.</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:26.526
<i>They are truly the best of America.</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:30.238
<i>And as we, as a nation,</i>

00:30.321 --> 00:33.616
<i>look to extend our reach</i>
<i>to the moon and beyond,</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:39.414
we find great comfort in the knowledge
that this courageous team

00:39.831 --> 00:40.957
will lead us there

00:41.332 --> 00:45.003
along with the many, many engineers
and scientists

00:45.086 --> 00:46.212
who stand behind them.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.923
Wonderful words, General.
Wonderful words.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.509
We have time for some questions.
Anybody have any questions?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.053
Glasses. The guy in the glasses.

00:53.511 --> 00:57.015
Is it true most of you are not astronauts?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.771
Becoming an astronaut
is a little like losing your virginity.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.148
You can't claim it until after it happens.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.320
Not all who go into space
will be astronauts.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.323
Some will be asked to weld.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.033
Others will be asked to wire.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.327
Unbelievable. What a great answer
to a terrible question.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.828
Thank you very much
for ruining the moment.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.206
You can sit down.
Anybody else have a question?

01:21.289 --> 01:23.249
Anybody? Meredith, are you here?

01:23.333 --> 01:26.419
Text me next time. Meredith, right here.
Third row. Meredith, everybody. Yeah.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.672
This mission is happening
four years ahead of schedule.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.299
- Mm-hmm.
- Impressive.

01:31.382 --> 01:35.261
How is it possible that you all are ready,
and don't you feel you're being reckless

01:35.345 --> 01:37.347
with the lives of your novice crew?

01:38.431 --> 01:40.433
-Well, that's an excellent question.

01:40.517 --> 01:45.146
And to your point, we are,
in fact, years ahead of schedule.

01:45.230 --> 01:50.110
You have to keep in mind
that the talented tradespeople on our team

01:50.193 --> 01:53.154
have been working at
the top of their profession for decades.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.950
So, in effect, they have been training
for this their entire lives.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.159
They just didn't know it.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.077
Wow.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.287
Really handled a terrible question
very well.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.747
Unbelievable. Thank you so much.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.000
Okay, I mean, I think we nailed it,
but does anybody else have any questions?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.252
-I don't see any.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.587
Uh, okay, good. Thank you guys so much.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.426
How you doing? Feeling confident?

02:15.510 --> 02:20.056
My entire career will depend on
what happens in the next 36 hours.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.392
I'll never get a second chance at this.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.603
And-- And frankly,
I'm feeling the weight of that.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.730
-I'm sure you are, as well.
-I'll be fine.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.190
No. It won't be fine, Mark.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.694
If it doesn't go well,
you'll certainly lose your position.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.695
I'll land on my feet.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.738
No. No, you won't, Mark.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.490
There are too many eyes on us.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.700
Stop it. Stop it!

02:38.783 --> 02:40.869
I get it. Keep it together, Adrian.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.245
All right? Just keep it together.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.652
- You know what you're gonna say?
-What?

03:14.944 --> 03:15.945
When you step out.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.781
The first woman on the moon.
I mean, that's crazy.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.366
-Congratulations.
-Oh.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.161
I... I don't know.
I'm just gonna do my job.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.954
All right.
It's just that, when you start talking,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.248
a billion people
are gonna be staring at your mouth.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.375
What are you gonna say?

03:30.335 --> 03:31.586
You know what? Just get dressed,

03:31.669 --> 03:33.171
or I'm gonna send you to space
in your underwear.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.130
Yes, ma'am.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.495
Verify actuators.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.789
Verified.
<i>Space Force One</i> ready for launch.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.832
-Good luck, spacemen.
<i>-Thank you, sir.</i>

04:09.916 --> 04:12.168
<i>-I don't think I wanna go anymore.</i>
<i>-</i>Too late for that.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.503
T-minus 45 seconds.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.588
-I'm getting out.
-Nope! No! Don't get out.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.131
<i>-I'm leaving too.</i>
- Don't do that.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.092
You guys are gonna have a great trip.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.094
A really wonderful time. Enjoy.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.428
You're gonna love the moon.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.180
<i>If not, do we get our money back?</i>

04:24.264 --> 04:26.683
Did you buy tickets from someone?

04:26.766 --> 04:27.976
T-minus 30 seconds.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.978
How do you get the seatbelt open?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.271
Do not take off your seatbelt.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.689
<i>I forgot about my bird!</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:34.440
Oh, my God. I'll feed your bird.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.109
What's your bird's name?
I'll take care of it.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.193
They're all gonna die.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.361
Oh, no. Here she is.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.365
She took
the goddamn bird with her.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.908
-What?
- <i>Stop the rocket.</i>

04:43.992 --> 04:45.785
<i>-Abortion!</i>
<i>-</i>Nope!<i> </i>Not possible.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.912
Mark, an astronaut has the right

04:47.996 --> 04:49.580
-to halt any launch.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.665
Go for launch.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.508
We have liftoff.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.353
Fuck, yeah!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.439
Coming up on bearing separation.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.606
Approaching max q.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.191
Side booster shut-down.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.985
<i>And... separation.</i>

05:21.446 --> 05:24.407
We have exited Earth's orbit
and reached trajectory.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.492
<i>Next stop, the moon.</i>

05:31.080 --> 05:31.998
Whoo!

05:37.879 --> 05:40.131
-Thirty-six hours.
-Thirty-six hours.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.898
Hey. Nice rocket.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.733
Ah. Went up good, right?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.151
Really high.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.741
Uh...

06:09.327 --> 06:10.745
Are you gonna say something? Or...

06:10.828 --> 06:12.455
-Mm. It's coming.
-Okay.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.373
Um...

06:15.249 --> 06:17.668
Would you care to go to dinner
with me tonight?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.130
We could continue the conversation.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.299
Perhaps add other topics.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.177
So it's a, uh, business dinner?

06:26.260 --> 06:27.553
This would be a date.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.888
Oh! Hey, ho!

06:28.971 --> 06:30.390
Okay. Yeah.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.891
-Sure.
-Okay.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.184
Okay, good.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.143
Great.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.229
I...

06:37.313 --> 06:40.650
would like to point out
that I am wearing a wedding ring.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.486
Okay. So now I know what we'll talk about.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.238
I just want to be
completely up-front with you.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.657
I don't know
if you're familiar with my situation.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.785
My wife is incarcerated.

06:50.868 --> 06:51.828
Yeah. People talk.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.996
So I am in an awkward position right now

06:54.080 --> 06:59.293
where I am both married and available.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.505
I understand if it's too much.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.590
No. That's... cool.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.719
I mean, I'm sorry for your wife,
but good for me!

07:08.803 --> 07:10.471
-No, I'm just kidding. That's weird.
-Okay.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.140
-But cool.
-Eight o'clock, then.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.516
Okay. All right.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.894
Listen, uh...

07:17.603 --> 07:20.815
really I'm interested
in mostly just companionship.

07:22.024 --> 07:22.942
Okay.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.944
Like a friend thing? Or is it--

07:25.027 --> 07:28.156
Well, initially, that's...
that was my impetus for...

07:29.615 --> 07:31.284
-Okay. All right.
-All right, all right.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.494
But, I mean,
if something else were to come of it,

07:33.578 --> 07:37.165
-whether it be emotional or physical...
-Okay.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.543
-That sounded really creepy. I apologize.
-No, I think I get it.

07:40.626 --> 07:41.794
We'll see what happens.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.712
-Okay.
-Wing it.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.464
-That sounds good. We'll wing it.
-Okay.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.923
I still love my wife.

07:46.007 --> 07:46.924
What?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
She's, uh, obviously a part of my life,

07:49.802 --> 07:52.805
but for the next 40 to 60 years,
not so much.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.892
Okay.
You know what we could do on the date

07:55.975 --> 07:57.435
is not talk so much about your wife.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.979
-That's a good idea.
-Just, uh, something to noodle.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.522
We won't talk about the wife...

08:01.772 --> 08:03.566
or sex, or anything.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.943
-What?
-Nope. Good night.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.571
That went pretty well.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.414
Erin!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.415
Hey, Dad.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.167
Hey, I didn't know you were running again.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.668
Uh, yeah. Wanna run with me?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.879
-Sure.
-I'll slow down for you.

08:24.962 --> 08:25.922
I'll slow down for you.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.256
Ha.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.554
-Go for Naird.
- <i>General, we have an emergenc--</i>

08:33.638 --> 08:34.764
<i>You sound funny. Where are you?</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:36.474
I'm running. What's the emergency?

08:36.557 --> 08:38.017
<i>I always forget</i>
<i>you have a watch phone.</i>

08:38.100 --> 08:40.019
<i>-That is so cool.</i>
<i>-</i>Brad, what's the emergency?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.104
<i>Oh, uh, it's bad, sir. It's the Chinese.</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:43.147
<i>You better come in.</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:44.649
I... I gotta go.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.067
Okay.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.615
The Chinese just claimed
the entire Sea of Tranquility crater

08:52.698 --> 08:55.159
as a "territory of scientific research."

08:55.243 --> 08:57.203
But no one can own part of the moon.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.664
It violates the Outer Space Treaty.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.750
Technically they're not claiming
to own it, just to study it.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.835
See, their research base is here.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.839
We're supposed to land here
and set up a habitat here.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.508
About 100 miles away.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.386
Hundred miles seems like
plenty of privacy for their study.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.846
We planned a very specific
lunar landing site.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.723
It would mess up our mission to alter it.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.560
A fellow scientist would be loath
to put our mission at risk.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.187
We need to open a direct line
to their research center.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.480
Do you know anybody there?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.065
Science is a brotherhood.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.985
Even if we don't know each other,
we know each other.

09:29.986 --> 09:34.115
Dr. Zhang, this is Dr. Adrian Mallory.

09:34.198 --> 09:39.036
First of all, allow me to say that
I am delighted to be speaking with you,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.788
colleague to colleague.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.333
And also that your study of the enzymes

09:44.417 --> 09:48.129
which enable the digestion of human hair,

09:48.212 --> 09:49.797
that was a game changer,

09:49.880 --> 09:53.467
and I have the greatest respect
for Tsinghua University.

09:54.969 --> 09:55.886
<i>What's your name?</i>

09:56.971 --> 09:59.682
Dr. Adrian Mallory.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.726
<i>Like the duck?</i>

10:01.809 --> 10:02.643
No.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.644
Uh...

10:03.853 --> 10:09.066
Let me begin by congratulating you
on your lunar success.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.235
<i>We are the first to live on the moon.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:14.280
Well, I'm not sure it matters so much
who was first,

10:14.363 --> 10:18.284
but it was a great achievement
for humanity nevertheless.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.201
<i>We are the first.</i>

10:19.285 --> 10:20.119
Uh-huh.

10:20.202 --> 10:24.290
Did news of something called
the Apollo missions

10:24.373 --> 10:26.042
reach you there in China?

10:26.542 --> 10:27.585
<i>Maybe that happened.</i>

10:28.002 --> 10:29.045
<i>Maybe not.</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:31.714
<i>We've also heard of the green screen.</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:34.967
<i>But your astronauts slept in the capsule.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.011
<i>The Chinese live in a moon house.</i>

10:37.094 --> 10:37.928
<i>So we are the first.</i>

10:39.221 --> 10:40.514
Yes. Um...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.558
Listen, Dr. Zhang.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.687
I'm calling you
in the hopes of clearing something up.

10:46.771 --> 10:51.692
The media is reporting here
that you made a statement,

10:51.776 --> 10:55.279
a declaration,
which I'm sure was misinterpreted,

10:55.363 --> 10:58.949
mistranslated,
but they seem to think that,

10:59.033 --> 11:00.951
on behalf of China,

11:01.035 --> 11:05.414
you laid a claim
to the entire Sea of Tranquility.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.957
<i>You stay out. Thank you.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:13.756
But, Dr. Zhang, you understand that
no country can own any part of the moon.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.675
You can't make a claim to--

11:15.758 --> 11:16.759
<i>Not a claim.</i>

11:17.051 --> 11:20.721
<i>We're simply occupying an area</i>
<i>of scientific study.</i>

11:20.805 --> 11:22.473
<i>We study the lunar temperature.</i>

11:22.556 --> 11:26.060
<i>And you landing to the crater,</i>
<i>that will change the temperature.</i>

11:26.143 --> 11:27.311
-<i>Go see other craters.</i>

11:27.395 --> 11:29.313
<i>Thank you. Stay away. Thank you.</i>

11:34.610 --> 11:36.779
Mark, don't overreact.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.656
I'll take this through
the proper channels.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.366
In the meantime,

11:40.449 --> 11:42.785
we should probably look for
an alternative landing site.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.121
But don't underreact, either.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.498
I don't wanna start
an international incident.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.251
And we don't wanna jeopardize our mission.

11:50.334 --> 11:55.339
And, by the way, "Thank you, stay out,
thank you" is not very fucking fraternal.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.466
-A... Adrian.
-General. General.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.885
<i>Mr. Broser's criminal history</i>

11:59.969 --> 12:02.805
<i>-reaches as far back as 1998...</i>
-What is it?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.641
<i>...when he was accused of starting</i>
<i>a San Bruno County</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:07.601
<i>and state park brush fire.</i>

12:07.685 --> 12:09.311
<i>We were okay with the plea deal</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:11.480
<i>'cause we thought</i>
<i>he'd get shot in Afghanistan.</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:13.232
<i>But I don't mind him going to the moon.</i>

12:13.315 --> 12:14.900
<i>I mind him coming back.</i>

12:16.777 --> 12:18.571
What the fuck, Brad?

12:18.654 --> 12:19.905
-Why didn't you vet that guy?
-What?

12:19.989 --> 12:20.990
That's inexcusable.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.908
-Me? I don't know how to vet someone.
-Ugh.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.454
It's easy, Brad. You just give the name
to our head media manager.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.247
Isn't that right, Tony?

12:30.666 --> 12:31.584
Tony?

12:33.377 --> 12:34.211
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.588
- Look up.
-The general...

12:35.671 --> 12:37.339
-wants to talk to you.
-Yeah. I'd love to talk to him.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.716
-Look at me.
-Right there.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.967
-Sure. Yeah.
- Tony?

12:40.050 --> 12:41.385
-Mm-hmm.
- Look up.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.054
-I'd like to see you outside.
-Yeah. Of course.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.891
-Somebody's gonna get vetted now.
-I'll kill you. I'll fucking kill you.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.768
Try it. I'll snap your neck like a twig.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.187
-How are you, sir?
- What the fuck?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.398
What the fuck are you doing?
I told you a million times.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.733
Why didn't you vet him?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.736
I told you a million times to vet him!
And you didn't vet him!

12:58.819 --> 13:00.279
Next time you're gonna do it!

13:02.072 --> 13:05.117
All right.
I need you guys to tell me all the dirt.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.495
Anything terrible
any of you might've done.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.829
Who wants to go first?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.417
Don't be scared.
We're gonna find out anyway.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.336
Anybody, all right?
Take it off like a Band-Aid.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.712
One, two, three. Somebody go.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.381
<i>My grandfather is a terrorist in Ireland.</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:21.842
Holy shit.
You came out big from the start.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.177
Has he killed anybody?

13:23.260 --> 13:26.263
<i>No. He's a terrorist</i>
<i>that doesn't kill people. </i>

13:26.347 --> 13:27.932
Okay. Okay.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.560
<i>I went to a Halloween party</i>
<i>a few years ago as a film negative.</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:33.854
So... blackface?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.022
<i>Wait. What? You did what?</i>

13:35.105 --> 13:37.441
<i>A film negative. It was clever.</i>

13:37.525 --> 13:38.359
All right.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.652
<i>I went as Gandhi once.</i>

13:39.735 --> 13:41.779
<i>That is not okay.</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:43.197
<i>Right?</i>

13:43.280 --> 13:44.323
<i>No, it's not.</i>

13:44.406 --> 13:45.324
Okay.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.493
I can't believe
I even have to ask this question.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.996
Has anybody masturbated
in front of an unwilling employee?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.416
<i>Define masturbation.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:55.501
I will not.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.088
<i>Well, however you define it,</i>
<i>I definitely did it.</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:00.214
Oh, my God.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.258
<i>It is very delicate.</i>

14:02.341 --> 14:05.469
<i>Either we seem weak</i>
<i>and let the Chinese have their way,</i>

14:05.928 --> 14:08.931
<i>or we risk pissing them off,</i>
<i>and tensions could escalate.</i>

14:09.014 --> 14:11.600
Exactly.
I need guidance from the administration.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.185
<i>Hmm. </i>

14:13.644 --> 14:16.313
<i>Or... I'm not telling anyone about this.</i>

14:16.397 --> 14:18.232
<i>You're not telling me about this.</i>

14:18.315 --> 14:19.233
<i>We never spoke.</i>

14:19.316 --> 14:21.443
<i>You just handle it,</i>
<i>and I'll write in my notes that</i>

14:22.069 --> 14:24.113
<i>we talked about you meeting a hooker</i>
<i>in an airport bathroom.</i>

14:24.196 --> 14:25.865
<i>-What was her name again?</i>
-Hooker, sir?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.324
There was no hooker.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.202
<i>Fine. I'll just call her "Charisma."</i>
<i>That's my hooker's name.</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:32.204
Oh, God.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.673
-Did you find an alternate landing spot?
<i>-</i>No.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.676
Our people enter the moon's orbit
in 23 hours.

14:45.759 --> 14:46.969
They do?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.263
Adrian, get some rest.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.891
Take a bath. I'm gonna need you sharper
than ever tomorrow.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.477
Well, I can't take a bath because,
as I mentioned Monday,

14:55.561 --> 14:57.521
I am out of bath salts.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.481
But nobody ever listens to me!

15:06.280 --> 15:07.406
How is yours?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.120
It's delicious. Yes.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.750
You know, people are always talking
about the environmental impact of beef,

15:17.833 --> 15:19.877
but, I mean, cows must be, like,
"Are you kidding me?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.629
What about the impact of people?

15:22.212 --> 15:25.007
Don't blame everything on our farts."

15:25.090 --> 15:26.717
I just said that so loud.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.096
Well, now everyone in the restaurant knows

15:31.180 --> 15:33.349
that you care deeply
about our environment.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.646
So are you actually allowed to date me?

15:39.688 --> 15:42.232
Uh, that is the arrangement
as it stands, yes.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.194
But, like, the military,
they're cool with it?

15:45.277 --> 15:49.448
Oh, yes, you're an independent contractor
and not a part of the military. So, yes.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.491
Mm-hmm.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.288
Then why did we drive so far
to go to dinner?

15:58.082 --> 16:00.250
'Cause, like, I'm actually open

16:00.334 --> 16:04.088
to seeing whatever happens next
in this wacky...

16:04.171 --> 16:06.131
whatever we're doing. Um...

16:06.215 --> 16:09.426
But it just doesn't feel good
to feel like I'm being hidden away,

16:09.510 --> 16:12.221
you know, like an old-timey mistress.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.393
I don't want someone
to tell my daughter about this

16:17.476 --> 16:19.436
before I get a chance to say something.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.730
I feel like it should come from me.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.732
Oh.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.111
Yeah, sure. No.
My God, I totally understand.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.112
I'm sorry.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.489
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you for getting it.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.993
No. God.
No, that's just you being a good father.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.119
Well...

16:35.202 --> 16:37.204
Just tell her before we have sex, okay?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.456
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.126
-Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.464
You don't tell me where to land.
I tell you where to land.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.426
You don't know me. And no, fuck you.
I don't know you.

16:51.010 --> 16:51.927
What?

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
And your paper was...

16:56.098 --> 17:01.395
it was absolutely redundant crap,
you nutsack.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.106
Your data set was unreliable.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.485
You confused me with the mallard?
I will fuck you up.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.072
Anyway, you only got your position

17:12.322 --> 17:17.369
after your uncle was appointed
to the National People's Congress.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.913
Oh! Is that a coincidence?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.540
I don't think so.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.585
I will fuck you up.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.880
I will fuck you up.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.102
<i>Hey. Chan. Are you there?</i>

17:45.981 --> 17:46.815
Go for Chan.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.817
<i>"Go for Chan."</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:50.360
I wasn't sure if this was serious.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.488
<i>Can you switch me to a private channel,</i>
<i>please?</i>

17:53.113 --> 17:53.989
Yeah.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.496
Hey. How's space, dude?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.789
<i>Uh, space is good.</i>

18:01.872 --> 18:05.626
<i>Listen, um,</i>
<i>I think I was supposed to prepare some,</i>

18:05.709 --> 18:09.088
<i>like, awesome sentence</i>
<i>for when I set foot on the moon.</i>

18:09.588 --> 18:12.341
A dozen people have set foot on the moon.
They only ever remember Armstrong.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.094
<i>Yeah. I will be the first black person</i>
<i>and the first woman.</i>

18:15.177 --> 18:16.887
<i>I think people</i>
<i>are gonna be paying attention.</i>

18:16.970 --> 18:18.097
Pressure.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.473
Okay.<i> </i>What do you got?

18:19.556 --> 18:20.390
<i>Okay.</i>

18:20.474 --> 18:21.767
<i>I'm thinking,</i>

18:21.850 --> 18:23.644
<i>"It's good to be back on the moon."</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:26.355
-"It's good to be back on the moon"?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

18:26.438 --> 18:28.649
That's terrible.
Who are you even talking to?

18:28.732 --> 18:29.983
Who's your audience here?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.902
Okay, how about,

18:32.444 --> 18:35.572
"Ladies, if you want to lose
a quick 60 pounds, go to the moon."

18:35.656 --> 18:37.282
<i>Oh, thank you. Yes.</i>
<i>You think that's better?</i>

18:37.366 --> 18:38.325
Well, it's physics.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.326
<i>It's sexist.</i>

18:40.244 --> 18:41.829
Okay.<i> </i>How about,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.705
"There goes the neighborhood."

18:43.789 --> 18:45.666
<i>Oh, you're so dead when I get back.</i>

18:46.333 --> 18:48.460
<i>No, listen, everyone's just trying</i>
<i>to tell me what to do.</i>

18:48.544 --> 18:50.295
<i>Like, my women's studies professor</i>
<i>was like,</i>

18:50.379 --> 18:53.924
<i>"You have to claim this for women."</i>
<i>My mom said to thank Jesus and Dr. King.</i>

18:54.007 --> 18:56.301
<i>Even my ex texted me to shout,</i>
<i>"Go Broncos."</i>

18:56.385 --> 18:57.845
-Hmm. That's a good one.
<i>-No.</i>

18:57.928 --> 18:59.638
<i>I'm the one who worked for this.</i>

19:00.180 --> 19:02.432
<i>I like "It's good to be back on the moon."</i>

19:03.016 --> 19:04.810
<i>Why can't I say what I wanna say?</i>

19:04.893 --> 19:06.061
I respect that.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.438
"It's good to be back on the moon."

19:09.898 --> 19:11.316
It's gonna be a classic.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.444
<i>Thanks.</i>

19:14.987 --> 19:17.030
I mean, do consider
"There goes the neighborhood."

19:17.114 --> 19:18.115
I think that's good.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.533
<i>Goodbye. I have moon business.</i>

19:24.454 --> 19:25.372
Morning.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.498
Morning, bug.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.167
I woke up so hungry today.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.335
That's all the running you've been doing.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.173
Listen, I, uh, have a question for you.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.091
Yeah?

19:36.341 --> 19:41.138
What would you think
if I were to start dating someone?

19:41.722 --> 19:42.681
What?

19:42.764 --> 19:43.724
I don't know.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.143
Your mom and I,

19:46.768 --> 19:48.896
well, we have this forced separation.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.522
-We're not--
<i>-</i>Dad, no.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.024
Ew.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.650
You're married.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.653
That's a terrible idea.
Mom would be crushed.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.864
-I don't know about that.
-I do.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.073
God. No.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.117
What are you even saying?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.244
You and Mom have your visits.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.705
-Gross. Okay, that's plenty.
-Mmm.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.207
At your age?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.542
When would you even date? There's no time!

20:10.626 --> 20:12.252
You don't even have time
to help me with homework.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.339
Please-- Please don't date someone.
Please?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.549
So sorry. Just gotta get to work.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.259
Oh, hi, Erin.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.470
Uh...

20:22.638 --> 20:23.680
Okay.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.849
Erin, this is Kelly.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.810
Kelly has a background
as a structural engineer.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.103
I can't believe you.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.605
Honey. Hon. Hon.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.026
- Oh, God.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.030
-What about the Fra Mauro formation?
-Asteroids.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.118
The Sea of Serenity
has the same protection as Tranquility.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.745
Not in our current orbit.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.413
-It would add days.
-Right.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.123
-Mark.
- Huh?

20:50.207 --> 20:53.543
I have been up all night
thinking about this.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.545
We are being bullied.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.130
Yeah. Possibly.

20:57.214 --> 21:01.093
No. Mark, this is about
standing up for ourselves.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.429
Here's a "what if." Okay?

21:04.513 --> 21:07.641
What if your friend, who runs the Navy,

21:07.724 --> 21:10.686
were to move a carrier strike group

21:10.769 --> 21:13.772
or, no, two carrier strike groups,

21:13.855 --> 21:16.024
into the South China Sea?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.361
That would certainly be
a very aggressive and provocative act.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.862
But would it work?

21:20.946 --> 21:23.949
We are trying to de-escalate,
not start a war.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.909
You know the old sport adage,

21:25.993 --> 21:30.789
"Sometimes the best de-escalation
is an escalation."

21:30.872 --> 21:32.749
You recounted to me yourself

21:32.833 --> 21:36.586
that when the Air Force
is at a loss of what to do,

21:36.670 --> 21:37.963
they drop a bomb.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.841
So why can't we do that?

21:40.924 --> 21:46.471
Please, just walk me through how--
how this could work to our advantage if--

21:46.555 --> 21:48.390
Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.892
Brad, see if you can get General Tsengjun
up on the screen.

21:50.976 --> 21:51.935
-Yes, sir.
-Great.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.105
I met him a few years ago
at an anti-proliferation conference.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.023
He's a good man.

21:56.106 --> 22:01.486
Mark, you know that this kind of
personal diplomacy yields no results.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.406
Sometimes it's important
that cooler heads prevail.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.367
Hi. What is the country code for China?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.869
Eighty-six!

22:09.328 --> 22:11.621
I was so happy to hear
you're running again.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.541
Dad told you?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.710
No, uh, one of the girls mentioned it.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.172
She kind of couldn't stop talking
about you.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.090
Even when I told her
you're just in high school.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.050
Oh.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.968
I think that's why she's here.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.595
Don't hang out with her.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.890
Mom, there's something you need to know,

22:29.973 --> 22:33.310
and it really shouldn't come from me,
but there's no one else.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.604
So, uh...

22:36.521 --> 22:37.439
Oh, God.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.192
Dad's cheating on you.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.277
He is?

22:42.736 --> 22:43.612
Yeah.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.824
Do you like her? Is she nice to you?

22:48.658 --> 22:51.203
-What the fuck?
-Erin, the f-word.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.662
What the shit?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.331
Okay, well, no one says that.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.875
I just told you Dad's having an affair.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.543
Yes. Okay.

22:58.752 --> 23:02.172
He said he wasn't gonna tell you,
so I'm glad he changed his mind.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.424
You knew?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.801
It was my idea.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.179
I'm seeing someone too.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.555
A guard.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.807
Her name's Louise.

23:11.890 --> 23:12.974
She makes me laugh.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.267
-Okay.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.189
Okay.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.024
Okay.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.443
-Okay.
-Honey?

23:25.112 --> 23:26.530
Well, now what did I do?

23:28.949 --> 23:30.909
<i>General, it has been a few years.</i>

23:30.992 --> 23:31.993
Yes, it has.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.286
How are your kids?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.539
<i>Just one kid. You know our policy.</i>

23:35.622 --> 23:37.666
-Of course.
<i>-General, how can I help?</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:40.210
General, I was hoping to smooth over
some of the friction

23:40.293 --> 23:41.628
between our moon bases.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.255
<i>This is how we should always do it.</i>

23:43.338 --> 23:44.464
I completely agree.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.924
<i>I admire your initiative.</i>

23:46.007 --> 23:48.009
I admire your responsiveness.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.469
What is this fucking shit?

23:49.553 --> 23:51.096
<i>General,</i>
<i>we would happily share Tranquility.</i>

23:51.179 --> 23:53.473
-Bullshit.
<i>-It's just that our team already unloaded</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:55.600
<i>a lot of heavy equipment there,</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:58.854
<i>and then took the forklift apart</i>
<i>and turned it into a rover.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:00.105
Very clever.

24:00.188 --> 24:03.275
<i>I am sorry, but we must ask</i>
<i>that you respect the boundaries</i>

24:03.358 --> 24:04.860
<i>of our temperature experiment.</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:06.486
<i>You understand.</i>

24:06.570 --> 24:07.612
Of course.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.823
Let us keep an open line of communication.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.283
-Thank you, General.
<i>-Mmm.</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:14.536
Well, you laid down
like a hooker on quaaludes.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.829
Heavy equipment.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.123
Who brings heavy equipment to the moon?

24:20.625 --> 24:26.339
Bring up the images of the satellite's
last pass over Tranquility.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.303
- Oof.
-What?

24:31.386 --> 24:33.013
That is an ugly habitat.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.347
-Oh, my God.
-It's huge.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.600
-Its footprint is ten times ours.
-So gaudy.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.727
Okay, okay. What do you see there?

24:39.144 --> 24:42.147
Well, lightweight construction materials.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.400
And... why would they need a forklift?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.693
Let's see a quarter-mile radius.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.362
Wait, back. No, back.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.448
What is that?

24:53.658 --> 24:54.784
Drilling equipment.

24:54.868 --> 24:55.994
H-3?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.498
Postulated to be in great supply there.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.665
What is H-3?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.751
Helium-3.
It's fusion without the nuclear reactor.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.252
It's an unlimited source of energy.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.838
Extremely valuable
and easy to transport back to Earth.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.548
One cargo hold full

25:08.632 --> 25:11.676
could power the United States
for an entire year.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.763
General Tsengjun
is not part of their space program,

25:14.846 --> 25:17.057
but he knew all about
the temperature study.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.393
How many of our generals know anything
about any of your studies,

25:20.477 --> 25:21.937
-including myself?
-Zero.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.189
-Zero.
-Fucking sons of bitches.

25:24.272 --> 25:28.276
You can't hide a drilling station,
you fucks!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.194
Okay.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.321
General, <i>Space Force One</i>
is 50 miles from Tranquility.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.782
If we are setting down,
we'll need to begin the approach.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.450
Oh, God.

25:35.742 --> 25:36.993
What's the next best option?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.453
Take out your balls.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.080
Okay. You know what?

25:40.163 --> 25:42.791
-This is a very delicate situation.
-We have all these weapons.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.209
-You need to relax.
-Why don't we use them?

25:44.292 --> 25:45.627
-Sir!
-You have to remain calm, Adrian.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.046
Enough with the carrots.
Let's use a stick.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.839
-Every time you use the carrot.
- Sir.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.341
-Never the stick.
-Excuse me.

25:51.424 --> 25:52.926
You're a fuckin' general.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.094
Use the stick.

25:55.053 --> 25:55.929
Bug.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.056
What's going on?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.976
If you and Mom are just gonna disappear,

26:01.935 --> 26:03.061
then there's no "us."

26:04.521 --> 26:06.314
I'm completely on my own.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.193
Why can't I count on
just one thing in life?

26:10.277 --> 26:11.820
Honey, you can count on me.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.655
Everyone counts on you.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.449
And I'm always in the back of the line.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.076
No. No. Erin, listen.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.122
I have all of these scientists
and astronauts,

26:22.205 --> 26:24.541
the whole Chinese government,
and they're all waiting for me,

26:24.624 --> 26:26.710
right now, to make my next move.

26:26.793 --> 26:30.130
But I don't care
because I'm here with you.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.339
Right now.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.842
You will always be
at the front of the line.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.385
Yeah?

26:36.052 --> 26:36.970
You bet.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.142
What is-- What are you doing?

26:45.729 --> 26:48.315
Listen, hon. We'll talk about it later.
Yeah?

26:50.108 --> 26:51.234
Forty seconds.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.569
What?

26:52.652 --> 26:56.281
I got 40 seconds with my father.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.782
Oh, honey. Come on.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.869
You really think that number's gonna go up
when you start fucking around?

27:01.286 --> 27:02.537
Language, Erin.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.080
Erin.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.210
I miss my dad.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.920
I should call him.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.548
Or I guess I'll see him at dinner tonight.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.233
<i>Space Force One,</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:35.236
initiate landing sequence
into the Sea of Tranquility.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.572
Our spacemen come first.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.575
<i>Manual altitude control is good.</i>

27:40.659 --> 27:43.745
Roger. Copy, <i>Space Force One.</i>
You are go for landing.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.039
<i>Roger. Understand.</i>
<i>Go for landing.</i>

27:46.706 --> 27:47.666
Three thousand feet.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.337
<i>Two thousand feet.</i>
<i>Into the AGS, 47 degrees.</i>

27:53.004 --> 27:54.005
<i>Three hundred fifty feet.</i>

27:54.547 --> 27:56.758
<i>I thought we were stopping</i>
<i>somewhere first.</i>

27:56.841 --> 27:58.385
<i>-You're too tilted.</i>
<i>-I'm not.</i>

27:58.468 --> 27:59.844
<i>Uh, you do seem tilted.</i>

27:59.928 --> 28:01.638
<i>-You are ordered to be quiet.</i>
<i>-Yes, ma'am.</i>

28:01.721 --> 28:03.223
<i>There's a nice,</i>
<i>flat spot right over there.</i>

28:03.306 --> 28:04.683
-Ordered to be quiet.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

28:04.766 --> 28:07.894
<i>Sixty feet.</i>
<i>Three and a half down, nine forward.</i>

28:07.977 --> 28:09.354
<i>-Five percent.</i>
<i>-I'm getting out.</i>

28:09.437 --> 28:10.355
Don't get out!

28:14.317 --> 28:15.485
<i>Contact.</i>

28:15.902 --> 28:17.195
<i>Engine stop.</i>

28:17.278 --> 28:19.739
<i>Descent engine command override off.</i>

28:20.824 --> 28:23.243
<i>Wild Horse, </i>Space Force One<i> has landed.</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:25.078
<i>We are now </i>Habitat One.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.468
Habitat One
<i>to begin stage one structure prep.</i>

28:40.552 --> 28:42.846
<i>-Eddie, please begin unloading.</i>
-Negative, Captain Ali.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.181
-Sir?
<i>-You just had a long flight.</i>

28:45.265 --> 28:47.308
Maybe you should stretch your legs.

28:48.101 --> 28:51.646
Captain Ali,
I think that you should go for a walk.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.689
Uh...

28:52.939 --> 28:54.774
Outside? A moon walk, sir?

28:54.858 --> 28:56.818
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>See what the weather's like out there.</i>

28:57.485 --> 28:58.695
Need me to say it twice?

28:58.778 --> 29:00.321
No.<i> </i>No, sir.

29:07.996 --> 29:08.955
Okay.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.326
<i>It's good to be black on the moon.</i>

30:29.702 --> 30:30.703
Oh, goddamnit.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.415
Uh...

30:42.215 --> 30:44.717
Well, I guess we get to keep our jobs.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.387
I fear I didn't keep it together.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.388
Ah.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.600
Did we really just do
what we really just did?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.270
We really did.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.736
