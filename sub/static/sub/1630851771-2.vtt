WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:04.459
Eddie 3.0 is back.

00:04.459 --> 00:07.542
But now I'm the first officer,
God help me.

00:07.542 --> 00:09.083
-Captain Sean?
-It's a pleasure.

00:09.083 --> 00:10.167
Guess I got you for a few days.

00:10.167 --> 00:13.501
I had a medical issue.

00:13.501 --> 00:14.501
-Hi!
-Chief stew?

00:14.501 --> 00:16.083
-Yes.
-Excellent.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.125
We're gonna have you
as our second stew.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.626
Okay.

00:18.626 --> 00:19.626
And we'll have you as
the third for now.

00:19.626 --> 00:21.209
Don't do anything stupid,

00:21.209 --> 00:22.959
because I really don't
care what position

00:22.959 --> 00:26.042
you play on board the boat,
I'm just gonna fire ya.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.167
Oh, God.

00:28.167 --> 00:30.042
This is Nikki Foster.

00:30.042 --> 00:33.959
Joining Nikki is
her crew of girlfriends.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.542
Request captain to join dinner.

00:35.542 --> 00:36.542
Bring it, Nikki!

00:36.542 --> 00:38.000
-Welcome aboard.
-Yeah!

00:38.000 --> 00:47.250
[shouting]

00:47.250 --> 00:49.042
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:49.042 --> 00:51.501
Completely unacceptable.

00:51.501 --> 00:54.209
So, anyone you're attracted
to on the boat?

00:54.209 --> 00:56.000
Well, I fancy you.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.959
Oh, well, hello!

00:58.959 --> 01:01.125
I like what I see.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.918
How's this look?
This looks good, right?

01:02.918 --> 01:04.250
This looks like sh--.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.667
Come back to me, Captain Lee!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.000
Come back to me,
my boat daddy.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.709
Eddie, Eddie, cushions.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.083
I just know the guests
are getting kind of

01:11.083 --> 01:12.667
itchy to get out there.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.709
If we can delay them just
for another half-hour.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.375
Oh, it's 1:45,
we're getting restless.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.918
Okay. Not to worry.

01:18.918 --> 01:43.375
Hey, Eddie, where's
the rest of our stuff?

01:43.375 --> 01:45.000
So, what's the deal?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.334
Are we not supposed to be on
the beach already?

01:46.334 --> 01:48.876
Oh, jeez, oh, jeez.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.125
Ugh!

01:50.125 --> 01:51.167
Eddie, Eddie.

01:51.167 --> 01:52.459
Let's get to the beach.

01:52.459 --> 01:56.125
Goddamn, I hate this.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.709
Eddie, Eddie.

01:57.709 --> 02:02.209
In my closet, there's, like,
a bag with shells in it.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.834
Grab that, and make
sure we get all

02:03.834 --> 02:05.334
the price tags off
the shells, too.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.709
He said take the price
tags off the shells.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.501
Take the price tags
off the shells.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.209
This day is kicking my ass.

02:10.209 --> 02:12.042
Captain Sean,
he's a man on a mission.

02:12.042 --> 02:15.876
This charter season is not
a sprint, it's a marathon.

02:15.876 --> 02:18.459
[bleep] my life.

02:18.459 --> 02:20.250
It's not even, like,
indigenous to this area.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.125
Product of the Philippines.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.459
Oh, my gosh, that hat!

02:23.459 --> 02:25.042
Yes, I'm the captain.

02:25.042 --> 02:26.083
I love it!

02:26.083 --> 02:27.751
Fraser, Fraser, Heather.

02:27.751 --> 02:28.667
Go for Fraser.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.125
Can you please meet me
in the sky lounge?

02:31.125 --> 02:32.501
Yeah, copy that, on my way.

02:32.501 --> 02:34.083
So, we're supposed to
be on the beach now.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.375
Something must be going wrong.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.209
I would love to send you
to the beach.

02:37.209 --> 02:38.667
You should have
everything to mix a drink.

02:38.667 --> 02:39.667
Yeah.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.417
So, I'm being asked
to run down to cabins

02:41.417 --> 02:42.959
and make sure
that they're perfect.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.792
Fraser, I wanna keep you
on housekeeping right now.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.417
Pull that head of housekeeping
out of your butt

02:46.417 --> 02:48.167
and let's make sure the
master's always perfect.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.250
But I'm also being asked
to do cocktail-making

02:50.250 --> 02:53.751
and to keep them entertained.

02:53.751 --> 02:55.167
Make some cocktails.
I love it.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.125
I'm happy as long
as you're happy.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.834
Get your sh-- together, Heather.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.209
That rhymes as well.

03:00.209 --> 03:02.167
All right, I'll get ready.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.417
Where is the fun?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.918
Goddamn it...
don't, like, mess their dock up.

03:05.918 --> 03:08.834
Put the table up there, in
the center... other way.

03:08.834 --> 03:09.834
Sh-- man.

03:09.834 --> 03:10.751
Get more... nice.

03:10.751 --> 03:12.501
I'm not a micro-manager,
I'm hands-on.

03:12.501 --> 03:13.751
Slide this towards me.

03:13.751 --> 03:15.542
It's perfectly square right now,

03:15.542 --> 03:17.542
so if we can just keep it
just like this, it's great.

03:17.542 --> 03:21.209
I've been the engineer,
the chef, ship psychiatrist.

03:21.209 --> 03:23.000
[laughing]

03:23.000 --> 03:26.083
There's nothing on board that
boat that I'm not willing to do.

03:26.083 --> 03:29.042
My Seanna, My Seanna,
we're ready for the guests now.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.375
All right, ladies, they're
ready for you on the tender,

03:32.375 --> 03:34.083
if you'd like to make your way.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.876
-There we go.
-Amazing.

03:35.876 --> 03:37.167
So we're gonna step here,
and then onto here,

03:37.167 --> 03:39.125
and then down, okay?

03:39.125 --> 03:44.918
Bye, you guys!

03:44.918 --> 03:46.209
This is beautiful!

03:46.209 --> 03:48.209
-Are you ready?
-Ready, Freddie.

03:48.209 --> 03:49.000
It's beautiful!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.375
Yes!

03:50.375 --> 03:51.459
I wasn't even expecting this.

03:51.459 --> 03:52.709
They did great.
They did great.

03:52.709 --> 03:53.959
I gotta hand it to the man...

03:53.959 --> 03:55.501
he sets up a hell
of a beach picnic.

03:55.501 --> 03:58.209
We started out with nothing,
and fabricated

03:58.209 --> 03:59.709
this amazing setup,

03:59.709 --> 04:03.167
which is great, in a sense,
but also it's, like...

04:03.167 --> 04:04.542
Did you get my secret bag?

04:04.542 --> 04:06.167
Yes, I did.
You're gonna kill us.

04:06.167 --> 04:11.042
Can I get you guys some
champagne to start off with?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.209
Yeah, two rosés.

04:12.209 --> 04:13.042
I'm gonna go grab their lunch.

04:13.042 --> 04:14.667
Oh, yeah, I'll take some.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.667
Oh.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.167
Okay, rosé...
sorry for the delay on that.

04:19.167 --> 04:20.209
Thank you, sir.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.626
-Port side, yeah?
-Just nose in.

04:21.626 --> 04:23.042
Do you wanna just
touch up the day head,

04:23.042 --> 04:24.459
just give them a quick wipe.

04:24.459 --> 04:25.709
I'm gonna get
the lunch stuff going.

04:25.709 --> 04:26.584
Okay.

04:26.584 --> 04:28.626
So, what do you reckon
about the guests?

04:28.626 --> 04:30.000
-They're frikkin' awesome.
-They're amazing.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.542
Which one do you reckon's
the best-looking, then?

04:31.542 --> 04:33.167
They're all so gorgeous.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.918
Like [bleep].

04:35.918 --> 04:44.000
That's hilarious.
Get your little flirting on.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.292
Crew romances can be
----ing terrible, actually.

04:47.292 --> 04:49.209
I was dating a chef
on my last boat,

04:49.209 --> 04:50.417
and then eventually we broke up,

04:50.417 --> 04:52.375
and then people just
feel like they needed

04:52.375 --> 04:53.626
to pick sides or whatever.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.501
So, I'm down to flirt with Jake,

04:55.501 --> 04:58.000
but that's as far
as that's gonna go,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.167
because, like, ain't nobody
got time for that.

05:03.167 --> 05:06.125
I know.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.792
How we doing?

05:08.792 --> 05:09.626
Fantastic.

05:09.626 --> 05:12.542
I have a seashell I found.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.334
-Well, there's my gift to you.
-Okay.

05:14.334 --> 05:16.209
But couldn't we have snacks
to nosh on?

05:16.209 --> 05:17.417
Snacks now, snacks are coming.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.709
-Okay.
-All right, great.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.083
You need anything?

05:21.083 --> 05:23.000
Okay.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.792
I have.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.709
I'm really shocked about Eddie's
behavior behind my back.

05:27.709 --> 05:29.417
It was actually very hurtful.

05:29.417 --> 05:32.834
Chef, as soon as the work
is done and alcohol flowing,

05:32.834 --> 05:35.459
she just becomes a negative
and toxic person.

05:35.459 --> 05:37.042
That's unfortunate.

05:37.042 --> 05:43.167
Where I come from,
we call that spineless.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.167
Champagne showers.

05:44.167 --> 05:48.459
Ooh!

05:48.459 --> 05:49.250
Ah!

05:49.250 --> 05:50.751
-Eddie...
-Yes, sir.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.042
I'll swap out with you,
because I'm tired.

05:52.042 --> 05:53.792
Yeah, you got it.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.584
My bag o' treats is behind
there in the plastic bag.

05:56.584 --> 05:57.667
Don't forget that.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.918
We'll bring everything back in.

05:58.918 --> 06:02.167
All right, great.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.501
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.000
My pleasure, let me know if
you need anything else.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.167
Okay.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.751
Delightful.

06:10.751 --> 06:12.167
-Nope.
-Swear to God.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.209
Probably.

06:13.209 --> 06:14.209
I've got a lot of...

06:14.209 --> 06:15.959
lot of friends that are,
like, girls.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.375
You've never, like,
broken that, like...

06:17.375 --> 06:20.542
Well, I... now...
now, I have done that.

06:20.542 --> 06:24.792
My last relationship lasted
a good eight months.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.083
She ended up moving
to Australia,

06:27.083 --> 06:30.709
and now she's still in
Australia, she didn't come back.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.000
I heard Australia's really cool,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.876
great surf,
so I understand that.

06:34.876 --> 06:48.209
I loved her a lot.

06:48.209 --> 06:49.167
Where are you from?

06:49.167 --> 06:50.542
-Florida.
-Florida?

06:50.542 --> 06:52.834
It's not that great.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.709
I drove Uber in southwest
Florida for a minute.

06:55.709 --> 06:56.501
Oh, God.

06:56.501 --> 06:57.959
Until the cops showed up
at my house.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.042
Really?

06:59.042 --> 07:01.709
Yeah, apparently I picked up a
guy who committed a hit-and-run.

07:01.709 --> 07:02.709
Oh, no.

07:02.709 --> 07:05.083
My grandparents were like,
"What did you do?"

07:05.083 --> 07:10.584
That's pretty crazy.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.584
I'm an old Jewish woman
at heart.

07:12.584 --> 07:15.918
Don't be such
a meshugene, Morty.

07:15.918 --> 07:19.542
I'm schvitzing.
I'm schvitzing over here.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.209
At the moment, it's 4:20.

07:21.209 --> 07:22.250
I was just kind of wondering
how you're all feeling,

07:22.250 --> 07:23.250
what you'd like to do.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.250
I'm hungry.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.250
You wanna get back on?

07:25.250 --> 07:26.751
We can definitely do that.

07:26.751 --> 07:28.459
My Seanna, My Seanna,
guests are preparing

07:28.459 --> 07:30.042
to come back to the yacht.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.042
Copy.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.042
All right.

07:32.042 --> 07:33.501
You can do it.

07:33.501 --> 07:34.501
Get home safely, ladies.

07:34.501 --> 07:35.834
-Thank you.
-Bye!

07:35.834 --> 07:38.000
Whew.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.501
Hi, guys!
Y'all lit?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.083
-Y'all lit?
-That was a great throw.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.459
-Thank you.
-Hi!

07:42.459 --> 07:44.042
-Would you like a fresh towel?
-Yes.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.667
Welcome back.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.083
How was it?

07:48.083 --> 07:49.083
It was amazing.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.083
Was it?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.250
[bleep] me.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.417
-Hit it!
-Yay!

07:52.417 --> 07:53.417
Rock and roll.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.501
-Woo!
-Cheers!

07:55.501 --> 07:57.417
There you go.
Yeah.

07:57.417 --> 07:58.501
-What do you want first?
-Everything.

07:58.501 --> 07:59.626
There's a lot.

07:59.626 --> 08:01.083
All these cushions.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.209
I don't know how we ended up
with so much stuff.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.959
I do.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.375
Rayna, Rayna, Eddie,
we're heading back,

08:07.375 --> 08:09.375
can you come to the laz, please?

08:09.375 --> 08:11.000
[phone rings]

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Hello?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.083
Can you hear me, Cap?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.375
-Is this Lee?
-How you doing?

08:14.375 --> 08:16.626
I'm doing great,
how are you doing?

08:16.626 --> 08:17.918
How's my crew doing?

08:17.918 --> 08:19.042
Good, no complaints.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.542
Is Eddie behaving himself?

08:20.542 --> 08:26.125
Yeah, very helpful,
great attitude.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.334
We'll be waiting for you.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.000
Never had to leave a
charter halfway through,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.751
and even though I've only
been here a short time,

08:31.751 --> 08:33.751
I feel that I have set the bar.

08:33.751 --> 08:36.375
And I hope the crew
will continue

08:36.375 --> 08:39.459
to raise it even higher.

08:39.459 --> 08:41.209
Hey, no worries.
Anytime, Lee.

08:41.209 --> 08:42.209
Whew.

08:42.209 --> 08:43.209
-Clear? On?
-Yep.

08:43.209 --> 08:44.417
We're on.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.417
I would love to take
a nap on one of these.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.125
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

08:48.125 --> 08:49.250
-You okay?
-You okay?

08:49.250 --> 08:51.042
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Stuck the landing.

08:51.042 --> 08:52.459
My mouth is so dry.

08:52.459 --> 08:57.918
-You're dehydrated.
-Ugh!

08:57.918 --> 09:02.876
All crew, all crew, please
come to the pilot house.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.667
All right, I'm going
to get in the Jacuzzi.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.125
-What's this about?
-Did not sound good.

09:06.125 --> 09:09.834
Oh, boy, here we go.

09:09.834 --> 09:10.959
Hola.

09:10.959 --> 09:13.083
All right, everybody, well,
thanks for coming up.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.792
I know you have to come
when I call,

09:14.792 --> 09:19.918
but anyway, just gonna
cut to the chase.

09:19.918 --> 09:23.209
Lee is gonna be joining
us this evening.

09:23.209 --> 09:24.834
I will be leaving.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.000
-Aw!
-I know.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.125
It's a bummer to see somebody
go, but don't let the passerelle

09:30.125 --> 09:31.542
hit you on the ass
on the way out,

09:31.542 --> 09:33.209
because my Captain Lee
is ----ing coming back.

09:33.209 --> 09:35.083
You guys have
all been wonderful,

09:35.083 --> 09:38.876
-and that's all I gotta say.
-Aw!

09:38.876 --> 09:40.167
Oh, thank you.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.042
...for coming here.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.709
Thank you.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.042
-My pleasure.
-Thank you for everything.

09:46.042 --> 09:49.167
-You're welcome.
-You're awesome.

09:49.167 --> 09:52.709
Coming up...

09:52.709 --> 10:06.083
I have never seen
a crew romance work out.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.125
[bleep]

10:09.125 --> 10:11.501
One of my friends he basically
said, "Jake, you'll love it,

10:11.501 --> 10:13.167
you get paid well,
you get to travel,

10:13.167 --> 10:14.876
and there's loads
of lovely girls."

10:14.876 --> 10:20.292
So, I was sold
at "lovely girls."

10:20.292 --> 10:21.709
All righty.

10:21.709 --> 10:23.209
He said he's coming round.

10:23.209 --> 10:25.501
Oh, my God!

10:25.501 --> 10:26.542
I know.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.667
Might be a little late,
but I'm definitely back.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.417
I'd rather sandpaper
a tiger's ass

10:31.417 --> 10:35.375
in a phone booth
than miss a charter.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.751
That's not gonna happen.

10:36.751 --> 10:39.000
First time on a boat?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.417
-How you doing, buddy?
-Great, man.

10:41.417 --> 10:42.667
-How you doing, pal?
-Good, Cap.

10:42.667 --> 10:43.375
Good to be here.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.834
So happy my boat daddy's back.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.042
Home sweet home.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.083
It's like you just left, right?

10:48.083 --> 10:53.792
Feels like it.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.042
-Yeah.
-The whole charter first.

10:55.042 --> 10:56.167
Yeah.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.250
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.292
Everything all right?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.751
Everything's going great.

11:00.751 --> 11:01.959
They haven't abused
you too much?

11:01.959 --> 11:02.542
Not at all.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.209
Overall, the crew's good.

11:04.209 --> 11:05.959
How willing to learn are they?

11:05.959 --> 11:07.292
Extremely, and they've all
got really good attitudes.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.709
-That's a good thing.
-Yeah.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.667
I'm grateful that Sean
helped us out,

11:10.667 --> 11:12.751
got us through the first day
and a half of charter.

11:12.751 --> 11:15.000
We've got a boat waiting
for you, take you back.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Fantastic.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.167
Hey...

11:17.167 --> 11:18.584
And if you wanna say goodbye
to the guests...

11:18.584 --> 11:19.876
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Sean.

11:19.876 --> 11:20.876
All right.

11:20.876 --> 11:25.709
Now get off my boat.

11:25.709 --> 11:28.000
Ladies, unfortunately,
I'm not gonna be able

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
to have dinner with you tonight.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.292
Oh!

11:30.292 --> 11:35.417
But Lee's back
and he just got on board.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.250
-I'm leaving.
-Oh!

11:37.250 --> 11:41.167
I know I'm fun!

11:41.167 --> 11:42.584
You're gonna have a
lot of fun with him,

11:42.584 --> 11:44.375
and I'm gonna leave you
in good hands.

11:44.375 --> 11:49.125
-Thank you.
-All right, thank you.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.626
All right, here we go.

11:50.626 --> 11:54.834
Captain Sean's taking off,
and it's too bad...

11:54.834 --> 11:55.959
Meh.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.083
All crew, all crew,

11:58.083 --> 12:00.000
Captain Sean is
departing the vessel.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.250
Once again, thank you all.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.000
FRASER: Thank you, Captain!

12:03.000 --> 12:04.292
Be well, Captain Sean!

12:04.292 --> 12:06.334
Who knows, maybe Captain
Sean and I will do

12:06.334 --> 12:09.125
the Northwest Passage
together sometime.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.167
But probably not.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.209
-Be safe, okay?
-I will, thank you.

12:13.209 --> 12:15.125
-All right, take it easy.
-All right.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.125
Talk to you soon.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.042
Okay, I have edamame.

12:18.042 --> 12:19.709
I think they'll just
do a finger, right?

12:19.709 --> 12:20.918
Yeah.

12:20.918 --> 12:23.751
Veggie gyoza, I'm gonna do that
one as fork and a knife.

12:23.751 --> 12:24.751
Okay.

12:24.751 --> 12:26.250
So tonight I kinda went
a little overboard...

12:26.250 --> 12:28.375
no pun intended.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.209
I'm doing a tasting menu,
Japanese-style.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.834
How do you feel?

12:32.834 --> 12:34.584
I'm good, I'm just,
like, super-focused.

12:34.584 --> 12:37.709
My drive is to push myself
as hard as I can go,

12:37.709 --> 12:39.667
to the breaking point, shatter,

12:39.667 --> 12:42.209
sweep myself back up,
Gorilla Glue it...

12:42.209 --> 12:43.209
but not in my hair...

12:43.209 --> 12:44.459
put myself back together,

12:44.459 --> 12:49.209
and then push myself
stronger and stronger.

12:49.209 --> 12:50.792
Heather, Heather, Lee.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.834
Do you have a second to pop up
to the wheelhouse?

12:52.834 --> 12:54.334
-I'm on my way.
-Thank you.

12:54.334 --> 12:56.375
I'm gonna go bring
Captain his dinner,

12:56.375 --> 12:58.209
-come up with you as well.
-Okay.

12:58.209 --> 13:01.375
It's very important to me
that Captain Lee

13:01.375 --> 13:04.667
sees me as a successful
head of department,

13:04.667 --> 13:06.667
and I really wanna
be sure to impress him.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.792
But I have to calm
the [bleep] down,

13:08.792 --> 13:12.459
take a deep breath,
and just remember I got this.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.083
-Hi.
-Mwah.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.083
-Good to see you.
-You, too. You smell nice.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.501
Knock-knock!

13:17.501 --> 13:19.918
-How's it going?
-Just fine, Heather. I'm Lee.

13:19.918 --> 13:21.918
Put this down.

13:21.918 --> 13:24.292
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure's mine.

13:24.292 --> 13:25.751
Happy to have you
back on board.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.042
Thank you, it's a pleasure
to be here.

13:27.042 --> 13:28.667
Pleasure to be here myself.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.709
It's extremely hard
to find a good chief stew.

13:30.709 --> 13:35.083
I have extremely high hopes
for Heather, but time'll tell.

13:35.083 --> 13:38.334
-How's it going?
-It's going good.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.375
Yes, well,
it's lovely to meet you.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.751
-Okay.
-Thank you.

13:41.751 --> 13:43.125
-Cheers.
-Lovely.

13:43.125 --> 13:50.667
Oh, man, this is hard.

13:50.667 --> 14:08.209
[bleep]

14:08.209 --> 14:09.792
I usually like to kiss
on the first date,

14:09.792 --> 14:12.042
leave it to the third date
before anything happens.

14:12.042 --> 14:14.918
By the fourth, you know,
get the ----ing dildo out

14:14.918 --> 14:16.000
and do whatever.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.751
Ha-ha, oh, my God.

14:19.751 --> 14:22.125
Peg me, baby!

14:22.125 --> 14:24.125
Ahoy there, matey,
how you doing?

14:24.125 --> 14:32.709
Good.

14:32.709 --> 14:38.918
That looks good.

14:38.918 --> 14:43.334
I'm loving this new look
the captain's got, seriously.

14:43.334 --> 14:46.042
He's so Captain
"Red October" right now.

14:46.042 --> 15:01.334
[sonar pings]

15:01.334 --> 15:02.751
Ugh!
[bleep]

15:02.751 --> 15:03.501
Perfect.

15:03.501 --> 15:04.959
Just gonna get all
the last things.

15:04.959 --> 15:06.000
Eddie, Eddie, Lee,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.042
can I get you up
to the wheelhouse, please?

15:08.042 --> 15:10.209
Copy that.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.626
Feels funny to be back at it.

15:11.626 --> 15:14.167
Dude, seriously,
it's like we never left.

15:14.167 --> 15:17.375
So, you are going to be
a working first officer.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.417
You are directly under me.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.000
With great power comes
great responsibility indeed.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.083
Has anyone been designated
anything other than deckhands?

15:25.083 --> 15:26.459
Jake is really good.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.751
-It's too early in the game.
-Okay.

15:28.751 --> 15:32.125
There are a lot of expectations
that Captain Lee has for me.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.542
Obviously, I'm worried that

15:33.542 --> 15:36.042
I'll never reach
those expectations, ever.

15:36.042 --> 15:38.083
Well, we have to have
one of those

15:38.083 --> 15:39.709
serious type conversations.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.417
Okay.

15:41.417 --> 15:42.876
Sit right there,
I'll be right back.

15:42.876 --> 15:50.709
All right.

15:50.709 --> 15:54.584
As first officer you have
a fiduciary responsibility

15:54.584 --> 15:57.083
to know the actual reason
I was not here.

15:57.083 --> 16:01.167
I was in the hospital.

16:01.167 --> 16:07.000
Second paragraph down is
a list of issues that I had.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.584
Did you...

16:08.584 --> 16:09.834
Was it a heart attack?

16:09.834 --> 16:10.667
AFib.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.626
Did you have any symptoms,
I mean...

16:12.626 --> 16:15.083
-I've had AFib for years.
-Yeah.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.459
But they fixed it,

16:16.459 --> 16:18.375
and it's amazing what they
can do these days.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.584
How you feeling since then?

16:19.584 --> 16:21.209
-I'm great.
-Okay.

16:21.209 --> 16:24.584
I had a condition that
I was born with called AFib,

16:24.584 --> 16:28.501
and it's when your heart
will just randomly

16:28.501 --> 16:30.209
go into an irregular heartbeat.

16:30.209 --> 16:33.083
They hospitalized me and
they actually burn off parts

16:33.083 --> 16:34.709
of your heart that
are trouble spots.

16:34.709 --> 16:37.709
Did it take a lot outta me?
Oh, yeah.

16:37.709 --> 16:41.250
You don't sit there and
look into the jaws

16:41.250 --> 16:43.417
and not have it
alter your perspective.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.083
So, I just wanted
you to know, so...

16:45.083 --> 16:46.209
Well, I appreciate
you telling me.

16:46.209 --> 16:47.834
You don't have any questions.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.375
But I do not want you
to treat me any differently.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.417
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna treat you harder.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.417
I will run your ass off
if you don't.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.709
You got it right.

16:56.709 --> 16:57.876
-See ya, Cap.
-Take care, buddy.

16:57.876 --> 17:00.209
-Let's get to work.
-Indeed.

17:00.209 --> 17:01.167
Coming up...

17:01.167 --> 17:02.542
Now, we never got
any new towels.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.042
Yes, let me get that
for you right now.

17:04.042 --> 17:07.167
I just feel like the wind
has been knocked out of me.

17:07.167 --> 17:10.125
They've had towels.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.209
I love you, Fraser.

17:11.209 --> 17:11.209
Unacceptable, my apologies.

17:11.209 --> 17:17.167
[bleep]

17:17.167 --> 17:21.042
Titties are out.

17:21.042 --> 17:22.000
Of course.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.459
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.000
This must be a lot like
putting on a bra.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.542
All right.

17:27.542 --> 17:28.751
I just need my red lip,
and we can roll.

17:28.751 --> 17:30.375
All right, let's go eat.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.167
These boots, did you say...

17:32.167 --> 17:39.250
I don't know whose those are.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.709
-Good evening.
-Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

17:40.709 --> 17:42.167
-Oh!
-Good evening!

17:42.167 --> 17:44.083
Well, well, well!

17:44.083 --> 17:46.125
My, don't we look lovely?

17:46.125 --> 17:47.125
Don't you look handsome.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.334
Thank you so much.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.959
I just wanted to introduce
myself...

17:49.959 --> 17:51.292
I'm Lee.

17:51.292 --> 17:53.000
I'm honored to join
you ladies for dinner.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.250
Join, stay awhile.

17:55.250 --> 17:56.876
Oh, why did I do that?

17:56.876 --> 17:58.167
The stakes can be
a little bit higher

17:58.167 --> 17:59.542
when you're cooking for
the captain.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.459
His say and his opinion
is very important,

18:01.459 --> 18:03.125
and I don't ever wanna
disappoint him,

18:03.125 --> 18:05.459
especially
after my previous actions.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.292
Suck my [bleep].

18:07.292 --> 18:09.083
Go [bleep] yourself.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.709
I'd rather not do that.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.918
I have no idea
why I'm stressed out.

18:12.918 --> 18:16.751
I should just take a Valium
and shut the [bleep] up.

18:16.751 --> 18:18.083
Hello.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.709
I'm just gonna go ahead and
start you off with your courses.

18:19.709 --> 18:22.209
This is my take
on street food in Japan.

18:22.209 --> 18:24.000
They have these little things
called takoyakis.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.125
Most of the time
they're done with octopus,

18:26.125 --> 18:28.000
but this time I just
did all vegetable.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.167
The flakes that are on top,
that is dried bonito,

18:31.167 --> 18:33.417
which is tuna that has
been very thinly shaved,

18:33.417 --> 18:35.167
so you have a
very smoky flavor to it.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.167
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

18:37.167 --> 18:39.000
Mm!

18:39.000 --> 18:40.792
Damn, that girl is good.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.042
-Yeah.
-This is spicy.

18:42.042 --> 18:43.042
-But not overpowering.
-Right.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.501
-Right.
-Right.

18:44.501 --> 18:46.459
We need people on deck
at... 7:00?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.959
-Probably 7:00, yeah.
-7:00 on deck.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.334
I'll see you
guys tomorrow, then.

18:49.334 --> 18:50.834
-Get some sleep.
-Yeah, all right.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.209
Good night, mate, see
you in the morning.

18:52.209 --> 18:53.167
Good night guys,
see you in the morning.

18:53.167 --> 18:59.083
See you in the mornin'.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.876
Girl, I know, it's a lot.

19:00.876 --> 19:02.876
It's like me and weight.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.334
Sick!

19:05.334 --> 19:08.083
For this course,
vegetable gyoza.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.751
That will be accompanied
with your broth

19:09.751 --> 19:11.459
that will be poured
onto the plate.

19:11.459 --> 19:13.250
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.959
This is so delicious.

19:15.959 --> 19:19.584
Mm!

19:19.584 --> 19:20.834
Have a beautiful evening.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.626
All right.

19:22.626 --> 19:25.125
-Thank you, Jess.
-You're welcome.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.042
How was it just, like,
not being on the water?

19:28.042 --> 19:31.334
I was so thrilled to just
get back out here.

19:31.334 --> 19:33.834
My wife was damn glad
to get rid of me.

19:33.834 --> 19:34.626
[laughing]

19:34.626 --> 19:36.250
Knowing that the boat
was leaving

19:36.250 --> 19:38.209
and I wasn't on it,
I was not happy.

19:38.209 --> 19:41.417
That being said, it feels very
good to be back where I belong.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.000
This is where I thrive.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.626
A boat without a captain's
like a boat without a rudder.

19:45.626 --> 19:48.834
She's like, "Don't you
have a trip you have

19:48.834 --> 19:50.584
to take somewhere
to do something?"

19:50.584 --> 19:51.834
"Somewhere" meaning
"out of the house."

19:51.834 --> 19:52.918
Yes.

19:52.918 --> 19:54.751
Heather is awesome.
She's a ----ing rock star.

19:54.751 --> 19:56.751
We're gonna do one
more katsu course.

19:56.751 --> 19:59.918
I don't know how that girl has
such positivity all the time.

19:59.918 --> 20:01.125
It's amazing.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.709
I mean, I'm 35 years old,

20:02.709 --> 20:05.417
and I'm sitting here in
a third stew position.

20:05.417 --> 20:08.167
But you got some stuff
to offer too.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.042
So, like, honestly.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.375
The way that I got into yachting
was me and an ex-boyfriend

20:13.375 --> 20:16.459
of mine spent
seven months living off

20:16.459 --> 20:18.542
of this houseboat
in the middle of Chelsea.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.375
A couple yachts in
the marina were looking

20:20.375 --> 20:21.918
for a yacht stewardess.

20:21.918 --> 20:25.626
I realized very early on
that it is so easy

20:25.626 --> 20:27.626
to romanticize
the yachting industry,

20:27.626 --> 20:32.209
but like any job, there's
positives and there's negatives.

20:32.209 --> 20:33.167
Do you see me every day?

20:33.167 --> 20:35.334
[grunts]

20:35.334 --> 20:39.042
I only see you in there.
I know you go other places.

20:39.042 --> 20:40.083
I'm okay to go with those?

20:40.083 --> 20:41.417
Yes, please.

20:41.417 --> 20:45.209
So, this is a tonkatsudon
chicken, a ginger jus.

20:45.209 --> 20:46.250
Thank you.

20:46.250 --> 20:50.250
-Oh!
-Does it get any better?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.167
This is a vegetable
tempura with squash.

20:53.167 --> 20:56.000
Mm-hmm.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
This is a tuna tataki.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.501
The outside is encrusted
with a [speaks foreign word].

21:01.501 --> 21:03.083
How is Rachel doing all this?

21:03.083 --> 21:09.334
-By herself.
-I know!

21:09.334 --> 21:11.334
Last season,
Rachel ----ed up.

21:11.334 --> 21:15.459
But everybody
deserves a second shot.

21:15.459 --> 21:17.125
Ladies, it has been
a very enjoyable evening.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.667
-Yeah.
-Yes.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.042
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you again, so much.

21:20.042 --> 21:21.959
-Yeah, thank you so much.
-I really appreciate it.

21:21.959 --> 21:24.709
And she is undoubtedly
the best chef I've worked with.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.959
It's been a long time
since somebody told me

21:26.959 --> 21:30.959
to have intercourse with myself
and got away with it.

21:30.959 --> 21:33.751
-I am calling it a night.
-Thank you.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.042
Thank you, honey.
Everything was excellent.

21:36.042 --> 21:37.167
Thank you.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.751
All right.
Yeah, go to bed.

21:38.751 --> 21:40.834
I just...
I want to get out of this dress.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.667
-I do, too.
-Sleep well, ladies.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.417
Good night.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.167
All right, I'm done, night.

21:46.167 --> 21:49.083
Write it on the board what
time you went to sleep, okay?

21:49.083 --> 21:50.626
Good times.

21:50.626 --> 21:51.501
Ugh!

21:51.501 --> 21:53.042
I'll see you in the morning.

21:53.042 --> 21:53.959
Sleep well.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.626
Thank you for an
incredibly successful day.

21:55.626 --> 21:57.709
It's been good,
and listen, it's over.

21:57.709 --> 22:01.709
♪ Champagne, margarita,
champagne ♪

22:01.709 --> 22:02.459
I love it.

22:02.459 --> 22:04.626
All right, good night,
thank you.

22:04.626 --> 22:08.709
-How's it feel to lay down?
-Really nice.

22:08.709 --> 22:12.334
Oh, my God.

22:12.334 --> 22:16.959
[yawning]

22:16.959 --> 22:18.751
[goat bleats]

22:18.751 --> 22:22.751
[alarm sounds]

22:22.751 --> 22:26.792
[bleep]

22:26.792 --> 22:28.667
-Good morning.
-Good morning, how y'all doing?

22:28.667 --> 22:30.375
-Just peachy.
-Good.

22:30.375 --> 22:35.918
Everything hurts.

22:35.918 --> 22:37.292
You son of a bitch!

22:37.292 --> 22:39.209
-Hello!
-Hello, hello.

22:39.209 --> 22:41.000
If you wouldn't mind helping
me just wash

22:41.000 --> 22:44.042
the shaker bar stuff that I just
pulled off the top of the bar.

22:44.042 --> 22:45.626
-Yeah, that's good.
-How are we looking on laundry?

22:45.626 --> 22:47.959
Can I shift your stuff
to the dryer?

22:47.959 --> 22:49.042
Yeah, thanks, Jess.

22:49.042 --> 22:51.209
-Hello, good morning.
-Good morning.

22:51.209 --> 22:53.334
We never got any new towels.

22:53.334 --> 22:54.584
Oh, my gosh.

22:54.584 --> 22:55.959
Face towels, hand towels,
and...

22:55.959 --> 22:57.250
Yes, let me get that
for you right now.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.334
Oh, my gosh,
I just feel like

22:59.334 --> 23:01.667
the wind has been knocked
out of me.

23:01.667 --> 23:04.709
The master has no face towels or
hand towels or regular towels.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.250
Fraser's head of housekeeping.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.209
I've put you in charge
of a department.

23:08.209 --> 23:10.000
Why is Nikki coming to me

23:10.000 --> 23:13.334
saying that housekeeping
is still not up to par?

23:13.334 --> 23:15.626
Where are the big bath towels?

23:15.626 --> 23:18.501
They've all went back
into the guest cabins.

23:18.501 --> 23:21.417
They've had towels.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.125
Yeah, so they did.

23:24.125 --> 23:25.125
I love you, Fraser.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.751
Unacceptable, my apologies.

23:26.751 --> 23:33.167
-Thank you.
-Of course.

23:33.167 --> 23:34.209
Coming up...

23:34.209 --> 23:35.083
Clear to swing, clear to swing.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.542
New dock he's never been to,

23:36.542 --> 23:38.334
he's got a new
crew handling his lines,

23:38.334 --> 23:40.334
and the weather is not ideal...

23:40.334 --> 23:42.125
very nerve-wracking.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.542
Keep the slack line.

23:43.542 --> 23:48.834
Come on, come on, come on.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.626
We're gonna warrant
two Fat Boys port side.

23:50.626 --> 23:52.000
Everything else is good to go.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.417
-Copy that.
-T
his is disgusting.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.918
[glass clatters]

23:59.918 --> 24:01.125
You okay?

24:01.125 --> 24:04.542
I'll get you a napkin,
just one second.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.250
-Here.
-Cheers.

24:06.250 --> 24:08.250
Cheers.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.584
Ugh...

24:09.584 --> 24:12.042
Can you get the vacuum
and the broom?

24:12.042 --> 24:15.042
Where is everybody?

24:15.042 --> 24:15.959
Shakshuka today.

24:15.959 --> 24:18.334
Yeah, and then I'm gonna
do Dutch babies.

24:18.334 --> 24:20.334
Okay, perfect.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.042
I got blood on the teak, so
I'm gonna go clean myself up.

24:23.042 --> 24:24.042
-Yeah.
-Fraser, Rayna.

24:24.042 --> 24:25.459
Go for Fraser, Rayna.

24:25.459 --> 24:27.209
Jake stepped on a glass.

24:27.209 --> 24:35.000
Do you guys have a dustpan?

24:35.000 --> 24:39.751
More pancakes for us.

24:39.751 --> 24:46.000
Grab six of those
stemless wine glasses.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.209
Sorry.

24:48.209 --> 24:50.083
Growing up, I was always
popping off when just someone

24:50.083 --> 24:52.751
had something to say
and I didn't like it.

24:52.751 --> 24:54.542
I was quick with it,
with the mouth.

24:54.542 --> 24:59.083
I was just quick
with it, always.

24:59.083 --> 25:02.542
And I just realized with age,
like, I can't do that.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.626
So that's why I just talk
sh-- in the closet,

25:04.626 --> 25:07.584
and you know, hopefully
no one ever finds out.

25:07.584 --> 25:08.959
You can't leave the glass.

25:08.959 --> 25:11.083
I was trying
to look for a dustpan.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.959
You just radio someone
to get one.

25:12.959 --> 25:15.209
I tried, but interior said
that they didn't have a dustpan,

25:15.209 --> 25:19.209
so I went to go look for one.

25:19.209 --> 25:20.584
Good morning, ladies.

25:20.584 --> 25:21.584
Good morning.

25:21.584 --> 25:23.083
I don't wanna leave.

25:23.083 --> 25:24.209
So you had fun, then?

25:24.209 --> 25:25.209
We had a blast.

25:25.209 --> 25:26.626
That's very sweet.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.667
I need to bring you
some more bits and bobs.

25:28.667 --> 25:32.042
So, when we get in, I want two
of those Shamus, the big ones,

25:32.042 --> 25:34.250
I want one port
and starboard, on the bow,

25:34.250 --> 25:35.959
just in case things
go squirrely.

25:35.959 --> 25:36.876
Absolutely.

25:36.876 --> 25:39.834
First time docking
this boat this season.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.083
I'm nervous,

25:41.083 --> 25:42.959
I'm sure Captain Lee's probably
a little nervous too.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.250
So, you're gonna come in
and bust a right?

25:45.250 --> 25:47.125
Then I'm gonna back
straight down.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.584
New dock he's never
been to,

25:48.584 --> 25:50.542
he's got a new crew
handling his lines,

25:50.542 --> 25:55.167
and the weather is not ideal...
very nerve-wracking.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.167
Okay.

25:57.167 --> 25:59.292
I'm about to take some breakfast
orders, if that's okay with you.

25:59.292 --> 26:03.042
That's perfect.
Awesome.

26:03.042 --> 26:06.042
So this morning,
Chef Rachel has two specials.

26:06.042 --> 26:13.709
She has a shakshuka dish, and
then we have a pancake popover.

26:13.709 --> 26:15.292
-Okay, perfect.
-Thank you.

26:15.292 --> 26:16.792
I'm about to blend
the shakshuka.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.125
Three shakshukas and
one pancake.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.667
Awesome, thank you.

26:19.667 --> 26:22.000
I have to say working with
Heather has been great.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.584
I have hardly any problems
with communication

26:24.584 --> 26:26.292
compared to what last year was.

26:26.292 --> 26:28.250
The missus wanted mahi-mahi.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.501
Okay.

26:29.501 --> 26:32.292
Missus had mahi-mahi, correct?

26:32.292 --> 26:34.501
Four mahis total.

26:34.501 --> 26:36.042
Yeah, no, it's five.

26:36.042 --> 26:42.000
----ing Francesca.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
-Can I set this?
-Thank you.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.334
Ooh, yummy.

26:45.334 --> 26:48.709
It looks so good.

26:48.709 --> 26:49.334
Yeah.

26:49.334 --> 26:51.209
How's the shakshuka tasting?

26:51.209 --> 26:53.751
I mean, I'm almost done,
so I think I have inhaled it.

26:53.751 --> 26:55.042
Let's pull the hook.

26:55.042 --> 26:56.459
All right, Cap, we're ready
when you are.

26:56.459 --> 26:57.918
Are you gonna call it all?

26:57.918 --> 26:58.542
You can call it.

26:58.542 --> 26:59.959
Let's get it off the bottom.

26:59.959 --> 27:00.792
Copy, copy.

27:00.792 --> 27:01.959
Now, be careful of the wind.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.375
-Yeah.
-That's good there.

27:03.375 --> 27:05.751
Short stay, 10:00,
up and down.

27:05.751 --> 27:09.626
The reason I work so hard, I
think it's kind of in my blood.

27:09.626 --> 27:11.375
-Jake, grab me a line.
-Copy.

27:11.375 --> 27:15.000
And my dad, he's worked since
he's been about 14 years old.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.918
I've always really
looked up to him.

27:16.918 --> 27:24.000
You've gotta be full-on, you've
gotta get to work and smash it.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.209
Anchor secured.

27:25.209 --> 27:27.000
Well done.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.042
New pose, new pose,
and give it to me.

27:30.042 --> 27:31.209
Prepare all lines and fenders.

27:31.209 --> 27:41.042
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

27:41.042 --> 27:43.083
Catch.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.083
Okay.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.709
All right,
I need radio silence.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.209
Our slip is the third one in.

27:50.209 --> 27:52.584
Clear to swing, clear to swing.

27:52.584 --> 27:55.542
Come on, come on, come on.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.542
I'm extremely nervous.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.959
I'm as nervous as a cat
with a long tail

27:59.959 --> 28:01.459
in a room full of
rocking chairs.

28:01.459 --> 28:04.167
Dock 50 feet behind you.

28:04.167 --> 28:05.167
Really lining up nicely.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.125
You're sitting about
five feet off the dock.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.542
All right, you ready?

28:08.542 --> 28:10.334
When he gets that on,

28:10.334 --> 28:12.167
you can take the slack in
as he comes by.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.209
Copy.

28:13.209 --> 28:14.209
Keep the slack--

28:14.209 --> 28:15.334
We have five feet.

28:15.334 --> 28:16.584
Copy that, let's lock it all in.

28:16.584 --> 28:20.542
Take tension.
Pull up, pull up.

28:20.542 --> 28:21.751
We are all locked
in back here.

28:21.751 --> 28:23.167
Okay, let's shut her down.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.709
Well done, everybody, thank you.

28:25.709 --> 28:27.167
It's every, like...

28:27.167 --> 28:41.209
Attention all crew, I need
everybody in their whites.

28:41.209 --> 28:42.042
Oh!

28:42.042 --> 28:46.876
That's what we like to hear.

28:46.876 --> 28:48.334
-Is there space?
-Yep, I got some space.

28:48.334 --> 28:53.542
All crew, I need everybody
down in the aft deck in five.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.209
Eddie, lose some weight.

28:55.209 --> 28:57.709
Cap, blame Rachel.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.834
-Oh, no, oh, no!
-Aw!

28:59.834 --> 29:01.501
Goodbye!

29:01.501 --> 29:04.542
[chattering]

29:04.542 --> 29:06.042
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

29:06.042 --> 29:08.250
I'm really sad to say goodbye
to these guests,

29:08.250 --> 29:10.542
because yachting
is predominately white,

29:10.542 --> 29:12.125
and a lot of people
in my community

29:12.125 --> 29:15.125
don't even realize that this
is something that you can do.

29:15.125 --> 29:18.959
So, when I become
a beautiful Black captain,

29:18.959 --> 29:22.834
I hope that I can open the
doors up for other minorities.

29:22.834 --> 29:29.417
God is good, God is good.

29:29.417 --> 29:30.501
But I have to be honest...

29:30.501 --> 29:34.292
We did have some hiccups.

29:34.292 --> 29:43.083
Heather, you know, we talked
about some of the interior...

29:43.083 --> 29:44.417
Coming up...

29:44.417 --> 29:47.209
One [bleep] up cancels
out 14 attaboys.

29:47.209 --> 29:49.792
It's not a great start unless
you hit it out of the park.

29:49.792 --> 29:59.834
Moving forward, there's
no room for [bleep] ups.

29:59.834 --> 30:02.042
We definitely had some hiccups.

30:02.042 --> 30:04.667
The trash changing,
towels, things like that.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.042
This ----ing sucks.

30:06.042 --> 30:08.042
I just need to train them
to do a little better.

30:08.042 --> 30:09.334
We have to step up our game.

30:09.334 --> 30:11.667
But I say all that to say

30:11.667 --> 30:14.083
I would definitely like
to tip my hat to Heather.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.667
I'm giving you my captain's hat.

30:15.667 --> 30:18.375
[gasps]
Thank you so much!

30:18.375 --> 30:21.918
Absolutely, and then
Captain Lee, thank you.

30:21.918 --> 30:22.834
Thank you.

30:22.834 --> 30:25.626
Love you all, I'll see you soon.

30:25.626 --> 30:26.626
-Stay safe.
-Be safe out there.

30:26.626 --> 30:29.167
Absolutely, you too.

30:29.167 --> 30:31.000
I'm coming back!

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
No, just joking.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.209
[laughing]

30:34.209 --> 30:35.209
-Bye!
-See you!

30:35.209 --> 30:37.000
-Be well!
-Let's go to work.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.250
All right, let's get this done,
let's get this done.

30:39.250 --> 30:48.000
Okay, I wasn't too happy about
that constructive criticism.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.125
We made it!

30:53.125 --> 30:56.709
Hi.

30:56.709 --> 30:58.083
I am in a relationship.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.501
He was a charter guest.

30:59.501 --> 31:01.292
It's kinda taboo,

31:01.292 --> 31:07.042
but it's also one of the hottest
relationships I've ever had.

31:07.042 --> 31:10.501
It's not easy for anyone when
you don't hear from someone

31:10.501 --> 31:12.000
you're dating for days on end,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.083
but for the time being,
he's very supportive.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.459
Heather, Heather, Lee.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.083
Go ahead, Captain Lee.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.083
Can I get you to the bridge
for a second, quickly?

31:21.083 --> 31:27.042
On my way.

31:27.042 --> 31:29.501
There's a bottle of vinegar
in the buckets.

31:29.501 --> 31:39.417
Okay, it's a bottle of
vinegar in the bucket.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.042
Sh--.
They can hear me.

31:41.042 --> 31:42.584
I have a question.

31:42.584 --> 31:45.167
She mentioned that we had
a couple of hiccups.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.792
Might I enquire as
to what they were?

31:47.792 --> 31:50.209
She had come to me
and said there was a trash bag

31:50.209 --> 31:52.751
left from her bathroom.

31:52.751 --> 31:55.375
And then this morning,
she had come to us and said,

31:55.375 --> 31:58.083
"I don't have any towels
out, all my towels are gone."

31:58.083 --> 31:59.584
That's not good.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.834
It's not good at all.

32:00.834 --> 32:02.375
Minor, but had major effect.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.375
Yeah.

32:03.375 --> 32:05.125
It's not a great start.

32:05.125 --> 32:06.667
Unless you hit it
out of the park,

32:06.667 --> 32:08.876
you know it's not gonna
be a home run.

32:08.876 --> 32:10.876
We just have to work
smarter and harder.

32:10.876 --> 32:12.667
That is not how I run
a boat at all,

32:12.667 --> 32:16.667
so I have confidence that
I'll sort it out well.

32:16.667 --> 32:17.959
Thanks so much for chatting.

32:17.959 --> 32:20.083
Thank you.

32:20.083 --> 32:23.876
Sweet potato fries.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.709
-Mm-mm.
-Docking went well.

32:25.709 --> 32:28.667
Nice job.
You guys are killing it.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.417
Wes, I love the hustle.
You're killing it.

32:30.417 --> 32:31.751
Thanks, man.

32:31.751 --> 32:33.334
Rayna, what can I
not say about you?

32:33.334 --> 32:35.626
You're doing great.

32:35.626 --> 32:37.751
Jake, you're a natural-born
leader, brother.

32:37.751 --> 32:39.042
And you're invaluable
to the team.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.834
-Cheers.
-Cheers to you.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.626
Attention all crew,
attention all crew,

32:42.626 --> 32:45.417
I need everybody in
the crew mess ASAP.

32:45.417 --> 32:46.626
Copy that.

32:46.626 --> 32:49.209
Food!

32:49.209 --> 32:50.334
Squeeze a cheek.

32:50.334 --> 32:52.000
-Pile in.
-How bad do your pits smell?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
He's gonna be right there.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.626
Pretty bad.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.334
Make some room here,
Jesus Christ.

32:56.334 --> 32:58.542
-Guys.
-Okay.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.751
First one in the books.

33:00.751 --> 33:03.918
And though I know you ran
your asses off,

33:03.918 --> 33:07.918
but one [bleep] up
cancels out 14 attaboys.

33:07.918 --> 33:13.292
That being said, the amount of
money they left us was 18,000,

33:13.292 --> 33:15.626
which is 1,500 apiece.

33:15.626 --> 33:17.501
Yeah, it's not setting
the world on fire.

33:17.501 --> 33:21.083
When they're counting out
how much money should I leave,

33:21.083 --> 33:25.501
the only thing they're gonna
remember is one [bleep] up.

33:25.501 --> 33:28.042
Go out, have a good time,
enjoy yourselves.

33:28.042 --> 33:33.459
But remember, in the morning,
your ass belongs to me.

33:33.459 --> 33:34.584
Enjoy, guys.

33:34.584 --> 33:35.667
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Cap.

33:35.667 --> 33:36.834
Thank you, Captain.

33:36.834 --> 33:37.751
Let's wash down.

33:37.751 --> 33:40.042
Okay, what would you
like me to jump on?

33:40.042 --> 33:42.292
I would like to jump on
clearing the rest of this.

33:42.292 --> 33:43.334
Ah!

33:43.334 --> 33:44.626
Are you serious?

33:44.626 --> 33:45.667
It's the wind!

33:45.667 --> 33:48.167
The air over here feels so good.

33:48.167 --> 33:49.542
We've gotta finish this,

33:49.542 --> 33:58.083
and then we can get out,
go do some boozin'.

33:58.083 --> 34:02.876
Done.

34:02.876 --> 34:06.876
Mom, I can't talk long, I just
have to tell you something.

34:06.876 --> 34:08.959
...because my mom knew I was
about to be a ----ing boss.

34:08.959 --> 34:12.000
So, she figured why not
name me after a boss?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.501
My mom is like my best friend.

34:13.501 --> 34:14.876
I always say, like,
we grew up together.

34:14.876 --> 34:16.292
She had me when she was 19.

34:16.292 --> 34:18.042
Me and her are very,
very close.

34:18.042 --> 34:20.292
I usually like to talk to her
multiple times in a day.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.125
She's the first ring.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.083
But I like everyone.

34:23.083 --> 34:25.125
I mean, I don't think
I'm gonna mess with anyone.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.250
There's only one cute guy,
honestly,

34:27.250 --> 34:34.542
and he's a deckhand with me.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.667
All right, I love you and
I'll call you tomorrow.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.876
I might sleep
at the table this evening.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.709
I know, I don't know
if I'm gonna be,

34:40.709 --> 34:42.542
-like, checked in or out.
-No!

34:42.542 --> 34:44.751
I feel pretty checked out
at the moment.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.959
Yeah.

34:45.959 --> 34:48.959
There was definitely details
missed this first charter.

34:48.959 --> 34:51.042
I think that's why I like
hiding in the laundry room.

34:51.042 --> 34:54.000
There's no pressure.
Nobody bothers me.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.209
It's like being in
solitary confinement,

34:56.209 --> 34:58.167
but I'm very good
at being alone.

34:58.167 --> 35:01.125
I'm an only child.

35:01.125 --> 35:06.334
You have a heart on your arm
that says "Mum."

35:06.334 --> 35:09.459
[bleep] off!

35:09.459 --> 35:11.876
You're so cute!

35:11.876 --> 35:15.542
I love it!

35:15.542 --> 35:19.292
Yes, baby, let's go, baby.

35:19.292 --> 35:27.083

35:27.083 --> 35:29.292

-Yeah.

Oh, lovely!

35:49.000 --> 35:50.209
Cheers, guys!

35:50.209 --> 35:52.083
To a happy season ahead.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.250
That ain't bad.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.209
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

35:55.209 --> 35:56.209
All right.

35:56.209 --> 35:57.792
[speaking French]

35:57.792 --> 35:59.626
Do you have a home
in Baltimore yourself?

35:59.626 --> 36:01.209
I have a little apartment.

36:01.209 --> 36:02.334
My girlfriend's there,
taking care of it.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.542
Oh, very good.

36:03.542 --> 36:04.584
Yeah, she lives
in New York City.

36:04.584 --> 36:06.209
So you met her two months ago?

36:06.209 --> 36:09.501
New thing in my life this season
is I'm in a relationship.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.167
I think I am kinda
getting to that point

36:11.167 --> 36:12.334
in my life where I'm
ready to settle down.

36:12.334 --> 36:13.542
You know, I'm almost 36.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.167
Better late than never, right?

36:17.167 --> 36:25.375
Oh, are you?

36:25.375 --> 36:28.626
Ooh!

36:28.626 --> 36:29.876
Now you're talkin'.

36:29.876 --> 36:32.042
Bar?

36:32.042 --> 36:38.125
Let's do it.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.000
I'm purely a spectator
in this sport.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.667
Cheers, cheers, again,
I know we cheersed

36:41.667 --> 36:43.542
500 times this evening,
but cheers.

36:43.542 --> 36:46.083
-And probably 10 more.
-So many more.

36:46.083 --> 36:52.000
I think you're phenomenal
at your job, I really do.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.042
-because of the comments we got.
-Yeah.

36:54.042 --> 36:55.751
And naturally,
I take that personally.

36:55.751 --> 36:57.667
Because we started off
the charter with Fraser,

36:57.667 --> 36:59.167
you're head of housekeeping,

36:59.167 --> 37:00.792
and the comments came
down to housekeeping.

37:00.792 --> 37:06.125
-Correct.
-But I spent...

37:06.125 --> 37:07.542
90 percent of my
time in service.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.584
It's always a
bigger picture aspect.

37:09.584 --> 37:11.000
I just don't wanna
disappoint you, either.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.959
Had I known where
everything was...

37:12.959 --> 37:14.542
Of course, it'd be a different
story, wouldn't it, yeah.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.626
How to do the turn-downs, it's a
completely different scenario.

37:16.626 --> 37:18.125
Don't talk over me.

37:18.125 --> 37:22.083
Moving forward, there's actually
no room for [bleep] ups.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.000
You can pull off
the greatest party,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.959
and at the end of the day,
a trash bag and a towel

37:26.959 --> 37:26.959
are gonna be the things
that take that away.

37:26.959 --> 37:34.209
We definitely had some hiccups.

37:34.209 --> 37:36.709
Moving forward,
now we know the boat

37:36.709 --> 37:38.584
and there's actually no
room for [bleep] ups.

37:38.584 --> 37:40.042
There isn't, yeah.

37:40.042 --> 37:41.542
So, it's a really
great learning curve,

37:41.542 --> 37:43.042
and I hate that it falls
on housekeeping.

37:43.042 --> 37:46.125
I only spent 10 percent of
my time in housekeeping.

37:46.125 --> 37:47.918
I don't see any kindness
or any warmth

37:47.918 --> 37:49.876
or vulnerability from Heather.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.876
So, you can't warm
to an ice cube.

37:52.876 --> 37:54.459
You're my boss, and
I don't wanna come here

37:54.459 --> 37:56.042
and disappoint you.

37:56.042 --> 37:57.542
And I don't ever want you
to feel that way,

37:57.542 --> 37:59.250
because you are
a reflection of me,

37:59.250 --> 38:00.834
and I am a reflection of you.

38:00.834 --> 38:02.542
Let's see what charter
number two brings.

38:02.542 --> 38:03.542
Absolutely.

38:03.542 --> 38:08.459
Would anyone like a drink?

38:08.459 --> 38:11.667
Can we do two lemon drops?

38:11.667 --> 38:18.751
We are those assholes now.

38:18.751 --> 38:22.167
All right, here we go.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.375
Oh, my goodness.

38:23.375 --> 38:27.792
What the [bleep]?

38:27.792 --> 38:33.375
That's our Johnny Depp boy.

38:33.375 --> 38:34.417
All right, y'all ready?

38:34.417 --> 38:35.584
All right, I got my beer to go.

38:35.584 --> 38:36.667
Let's get it.

38:36.667 --> 38:39.083
To the cars.
Cars are here.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.042
Hola.

38:40.042 --> 38:41.459
After you, darling.

38:41.459 --> 38:42.626
-Oh, should we get in...
-You should get in.

38:42.626 --> 38:44.083
-Yeah.
-Get the first one in.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.125
But did you guys see
Rayna kinda, like...

38:46.125 --> 38:48.042
I think they're gonna hook up,
straight up.

38:48.042 --> 38:52.209
Yeah, I think so.

38:52.209 --> 38:56.209
I got that weh lih.

38:56.209 --> 39:01.501
-Ew!
-No!

39:01.501 --> 39:03.083
-[Rayna belches]
-Rayna, disgusting.

39:03.083 --> 39:05.667
Sorry, that was not ladylike.

39:05.667 --> 39:06.959
Mother----er.

39:06.959 --> 39:09.125
I'm really quite tipsy actually.

39:09.125 --> 39:15.042
All right, I'm gonna change
into something comfortable.

39:15.042 --> 39:16.751
Oh, bastard!

39:16.751 --> 39:19.501
Night-night, ladies.

39:19.501 --> 39:23.042
No, I'm going to a
hot spot called my bed.

39:23.042 --> 39:33.501
Those shrimps?

39:33.501 --> 39:34.584
Woohoo!

39:34.584 --> 39:37.167
[laughing]

39:37.167 --> 39:40.959
Boob!

39:40.959 --> 39:42.209
-Who's going?
-I'm coming.

39:42.209 --> 39:43.125
Good night, boys.

39:43.125 --> 39:44.375
Good night, mate,
see you in the morning.

39:44.375 --> 39:45.876
I'll see you in the morning.

39:45.876 --> 39:49.626
See you in the morning,
I'm going to sleep.

39:49.626 --> 39:53.209
Let's go.

39:53.209 --> 39:58.209
Guys, it's us three.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.292
-No way, it's too cold.
-Rayna, behave yourself.

40:00.292 --> 40:02.709
It's too cold.

40:02.709 --> 40:04.501
-It's too cold.
-That's amazing.

40:04.501 --> 40:06.334
-I congratulate you
-[phone rings]

40:06.334 --> 40:23.000
All right, once again,
I gotta talk.

40:23.000 --> 40:29.125
I have never seen a
crew romance work out.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.209
You've got nearly eight
billion people on this planet,

40:31.209 --> 40:33.626
and you really think that
that person's the one for you?

40:33.626 --> 40:47.375
No.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.000
Are you guys off the Jacuzzi?

40:49.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, we good.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.918
Yeah, baby.

41:21.918 --> 41:23.125
You're stupid.
Good night.

41:23.125 --> 41:26.918
Thank God.

41:26.918 --> 41:32.042
It's me.

41:32.042 --> 41:36.000
Ow.

41:36.000 --> 41:43.459
Jake is very hot.
I like him.

41:43.459 --> 41:47.167
Oh, Rayna, why did you do this?

41:47.167 --> 41:50.584
Yeah, so, I'm talking to
someone that I met in Mexico.

41:50.584 --> 41:55.209
We just like each other a lot.

41:55.209 --> 42:01.375
This isn't good.
This isn't good at all.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.042
Next, on "Below Deck"...

42:03.042 --> 42:07.083
Last season, there were some
really alarming things

42:07.083 --> 42:09.417
that were said on
your behalf about me.

42:09.417 --> 42:12.959
It was, like,
viciously attacking.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.417
-Did you have a smooch?
-Ugh!

42:14.417 --> 42:16.709
Did you?
Did you!

42:16.709 --> 42:19.042
Ooh, morning, morning.

42:19.042 --> 42:20.167
How's it going?

42:20.167 --> 42:21.501
Good, how are you?

42:21.501 --> 42:23.542
I feel that we need
to pick up the pace

42:23.542 --> 42:26.709
in laundry and
making cocktails.

42:26.709 --> 42:28.876
Primary charter guest is
Michael Durham.

42:28.876 --> 42:30.375
They would like to
invite me to

42:30.375 --> 42:32.375
a whiskey-paired,
multi-course dinner.

42:32.375 --> 42:34.125
What does your wife do?

42:34.125 --> 42:35.167
Nothing.

42:35.167 --> 42:36.375
She's paid her dues.

42:36.375 --> 42:40.626
She has to put up with your ass.

42:40.626 --> 42:41.834
Morons.

42:41.834 --> 42:44.876
Get your ass up and get the
[bleep] down these stairs.

42:44.876 --> 42:47.334
Oh, my God.

42:47.334 --> 42:50.209
Hurry up, pitter-patter,
mother----er, let's go.

42:50.209 --> 42:52.501
Crouching tiger, hidden stew?

42:52.501 --> 42:54.918
I think it's best we
all just...

42:54.918 --> 42:57.209
No, go [bleep] yourself and
throw yourself off the boat.

42:57.209 --> 42:58.209
It's dangerous.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.334
Stay away from each
other right now.

42:59.334 --> 43:00.459
-Oh [bleep].
-Can... no.

43:00.459 --> 43:04.459
This is some ----ing sh--.
