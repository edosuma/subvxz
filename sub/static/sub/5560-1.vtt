- You know whose bag this is?
- No clue.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.650
Ma'am?

00:28.700 --> 00:30.500
Do you know whose bag this is?

00:31.400 --> 00:33.100
Excuse me, is this yours?

00:35.650 --> 00:37.000
_

00:39.300 --> 00:41.200
_

01:02.250 --> 01:05.844
_

01:13.750 --> 01:15.550
No signs of radiation.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.300
Commencing manual inspection.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.750
Nothing anomalous on the exterior.

01:24.150 --> 01:28.100
Okay, I'm gonna feel for wires.
See what we're dealing with here.

01:34.450 --> 01:35.650
Ah!

01:36.650 --> 01:38.200
There's something in there!

02:26.681 --> 02:28.181
Turn around!

02:28.450 --> 02:31.300
On your knees! Hands on your head!

02:32.250 --> 02:35.050
Turn around! On your knees!

02:35.100 --> 02:37.650
Hands on your head! Now!

02:44.150 --> 02:45.800
Are you guys seeing this?

02:58.750 --> 03:00.450
_

03:00.500 --> 03:02.750
Approaching suspect's residence.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.350
Be advised. Known suspect is armed.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.800
♪ Will make a way ♪

03:12.350 --> 03:16.950
♪ Yes, Lord will ♪

03:19.150 --> 03:21.550
Stop it! You hear? What's all that crying?

03:21.600 --> 03:25.350
And you, shut up! All right? I need quiet!

03:25.400 --> 03:28.550
I told you. I told you
I want you to behave.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.300
Single tango. He's pacing.

03:35.350 --> 03:37.050
Three hostages.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.400
What's that? A cat or a dog?

03:40.500 --> 03:41.950
It's a baby.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.250
- I can't think.
- Quiet, baby.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.700
Don't let that baby cry
in here. You understand?

03:46.750 --> 03:49.400
- No, no!
- Get up against the wall, I said.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.200
- Let's move now.
- Wait, wait, wait!

03:51.250 --> 03:54.600
I don't like our odds on those stairs.
This could go sideways real quick.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.600
How many door charges you got?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.250
Get 'em out.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.650
I just need quiet!

04:07.378 --> 04:08.578
Argh!

04:17.000 --> 04:18.800
Help me! Somebody help!

04:24.800 --> 04:27.100
Turn over. Turn over!

04:27.850 --> 04:30.350
- I think my leg broke!
- Shut up!

04:30.400 --> 04:32.250
I'll break more than your leg.

04:53.850 --> 04:56.586
Agent Weller, we've had a
critical incident in Times Square.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.850
You're needed in New
York right away. Let's go.

05:07.250 --> 05:10.650
She's still pretty out of
it. Almost certainly drugged.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.400
Bruising and restraint marks
on her wrists and ankles.

05:13.450 --> 05:14.950
- Director Mayfair.
- Dr. Borden.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.350
This is Supervisory
Special Agent Kurt Weller.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
- Oh, you? Wow.
- What have you got?

05:20.650 --> 05:24.150
Um, we got the tox screen back.
And you are not gonna believe this.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.752
Are you familiar with the PKM-zeta
inhibitor commonly known as ZIP?

05:27.753 --> 05:29.720
Doctor, you and I have very different ideas

05:29.721 --> 05:31.400
of what "commonly" means.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.300
Zeta Interacting Protein.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.400
It's an experimental drug being
tested with PTSD sufferers.

05:36.450 --> 05:39.050
Wreck victims, soldiers
who've seen combat...

05:39.100 --> 05:42.150
Used sparingly, it can
erase selected memories.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.000
And you found traces in our girl?

05:44.050 --> 05:46.150
No. Not traces.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.489
Her whole system is flooded with it.

05:49.490 --> 05:51.355
I-I've never seen anything like it before.

05:51.421 --> 05:55.086
It's created a chemically induced
state of permanent amnesia.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.600
She can't remember who she is,
where she came from, nothing...

05:58.650 --> 06:01.200
before she crawled out of
that bag in Times Square.

06:01.850 --> 06:03.750
So what does this got to do with me?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.250
Do you recognize her?

06:11.750 --> 06:13.050
No.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.850
I've never seen that
woman before in my life.

06:29.350 --> 06:32.100
Then why is your name tattooed on her back?

06:38.900 --> 06:41.900
Transcribed by Addic7ed Team
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:50.500 --> 06:51.850
Who is Jane Doe?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.450
And why was she dropped into
Times Square for us to find?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.150
And why the hell is my
name tattooed on her back?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.750
All right. Reed, Zapata,
you're on my case histories.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.000
Now, you find out if anyone that I
put away got out of prison recently.

07:03.050 --> 07:06.700
I don't recall any similar M.O.s,
but I could be missing something.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.300
As for this Jane Doe,

07:08.350 --> 07:10.600
let's try to squeeze some
blood out of that stone.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.900
Her narrative memory has been obliterated,

07:12.950 --> 07:15.131
but her procedural memory
still seems to be intact.

07:15.132 --> 07:17.150
So she can walk, talk,
understand the world?

07:17.151 --> 07:20.294
Yeah, conceptually, it all seems to
be there, but the specifics are cloudy.

07:20.295 --> 07:23.750
For instance, she knows what music
is, but doesn't remember The Beatles.

07:23.949 --> 07:26.012
And she'll never get her memory back?

07:26.037 --> 07:28.142
Honestly, we have never
had a case like this before.

07:28.143 --> 07:31.150
And when I say "we", I mean
the entirety of medical science.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.600
So, it's possible that something
familiar could trigger her memory, but...

07:35.743 --> 07:37.693
there is no way to know for sure.

07:41.850 --> 07:43.800
This woman did not just
come out of thin air.

07:43.850 --> 07:47.350
I don't think that someone carried
that duffel bag into Times Square.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.050
If it were me, I'd have done in a van.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.836
Side door, quick drop.

07:51.837 --> 07:54.550
Zapata, get all of Times
Square CCTV footage.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.050
Find out how she got there.

07:56.450 --> 07:57.650
Patterson.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.400
I want Jane Doe printed,
photographed, scanned

08:01.450 --> 08:04.500
into every Missing Persons and
social media database out there.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.150
Run her DNA through CODIS.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.450
I know it's not gonna give us anything
quickly 'til a full genealogist study.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.550
Cross every "t", dot
every "i". You do it all.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.148
Does that hurt?

08:17.450 --> 08:19.800
Yes, they're... they're all a little sore.

08:21.650 --> 08:23.250
Your tattoos?

08:25.050 --> 08:27.150
I'm gonna need to image them.

08:28.150 --> 08:29.600
All of them?

08:35.227 --> 08:36.428
_

08:44.600 --> 08:47.458
It won't surprise you that 78%
of the cameras in Times Square

08:47.459 --> 08:49.905
are either out of commission,
out of position, or out of focus.

08:49.906 --> 08:52.950
I managed to pull this,
though. Van. Side door.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.100
Do you ever get tired of being right?

08:55.150 --> 08:56.400
No.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.650
- Did you get the plates?
- No.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.450
But I followed it through the CCTV grid.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.100
It enters this camera's dead zone,
across town, and never comes out.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.450
State your name for the record.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.000
I don't remember.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.800
Who is the current president
of the United States?

09:21.800 --> 09:23.500
I-I don't know.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.300
What is your mother's name?

09:30.650 --> 09:33.400
All of her tattoos are brand-new.

09:33.450 --> 09:36.300
- All of them.
- What? How new?

09:36.550 --> 09:39.400
Judging by the healing,
no more than a few weeks.

09:39.450 --> 09:42.650
Her entire body was tattooed all at once?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.600
Now why would they do that?

09:45.900 --> 09:48.100
- It's a treasure map.
- Come again?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.700
Look at it.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.800
There's no "x" to mark the spot.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.668
There's hidden letters,
random numbers, map pieces.

09:55.669 --> 09:57.319
Without context or names.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.600
It's a puzzle.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
And the first piece couldn't be clearer.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.018
Have you ever, directly or indirectly,

10:05.019 --> 10:08.100
been involved with or assisted
a terrorist organization?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.480
How many more of these are there?

10:09.481 --> 10:11.283
Try to limit your answers to "yes" or "no".

10:11.284 --> 10:14.550
It's the same answer every
time.  "I don't know."

10:14.800 --> 10:17.892
I don't know what's going on, I
don't know what's happening to me,

10:17.911 --> 10:20.500
and I don't know how else to tell you that.

10:21.650 --> 10:24.850
- Hold on, wait a second. Miss?
- Miss what?

10:25.350 --> 10:27.000
Miss who?

10:27.050 --> 10:28.800
I don't have a name.

10:29.450 --> 10:33.300
I let you people poke
me, prod me, scan me...

10:34.050 --> 10:35.900
I'm done.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.758
Okay? I want to speak to someone in charge.

10:37.759 --> 10:42.300
- Let's just take a deep breath...
- I want to speak to someone in charge.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.950
I'm Special Agent Kurt Weller.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.550
I'm the lead agent on your case.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.000
Please tell me you know what's going on.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.400
Who am I?

10:59.300 --> 11:00.850
We don't know yet.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.400
All these tests and
you don't know anything?

11:05.250 --> 11:07.600
We know that you're telling us the truth.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.350
We're certain of that now.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.600
- Of course I am, why would I...
- Ma'am...

11:11.650 --> 11:15.850
There is no match to
your prints. Or your DNA.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.850
And facial recognition did not
find you in any of our databases.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.900
Do you recognize me?

11:29.750 --> 11:31.550
Why would I r... I...

11:32.350 --> 11:34.000
I don't even recognize me.

11:34.050 --> 11:38.300
Dr. Borden believes if you
encounter familiar stimuli,

11:38.350 --> 11:39.850
it may trigger your memory.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.750
Why would you be familiar?

11:43.650 --> 11:47.000
Because my name, Kurt Weller...

11:47.500 --> 11:49.350
is tattooed on your back.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.450
What is happening to me?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.300
I don't know who you are, ma'am.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.650
But maybe, somehow, you knew me.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.050
- I don't understand any of this.
- I know this is overwhelming.

12:06.150 --> 12:10.350
But please, try. Something
may come back to you.

12:43.550 --> 12:45.100
Anything?

12:49.300 --> 12:50.650
No.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.400
So, what happens now?

12:58.700 --> 13:02.000
We will release a clean
photograph of you to the media.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.800
- Someone must know who you are.
- No, what's...

13:05.850 --> 13:07.850
that's not what I meant. I mean...

13:08.650 --> 13:10.700
What happens right now?

13:11.900 --> 13:13.800
I don't have anywhere to go.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.400
So, this is a safe house...

13:23.450 --> 13:26.150
we use for people in protective custody.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.300
There is a couch, TV...

13:29.800 --> 13:31.450
Everything you need.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.955
Are the, um... guys outside...

13:33.956 --> 13:37.000
are... are they to keep
people out, or me in?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.850
No, no, they're...

13:38.900 --> 13:40.850
they're here just for now to keep you safe

13:40.900 --> 13:42.900
until we get to the bottom of this.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.150
Um...

13:44.650 --> 13:47.450
- I... I'll give you some privacy.
- Wait. You're leaving?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.700
Yeah. You should... you
should get some sleep

13:49.750 --> 13:51.400
or get something to eat.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.500
So, if there's any food you like,

13:53.501 --> 13:55.374
tell the security guys
and they'll get it for you.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.150
I don't... I don't know what I like.

13:57.675 --> 13:59.125
Er... right, um...

13:59.350 --> 14:01.300
I'll get them to get you a bunch of menus,

14:01.350 --> 14:02.950
so you can choose.

14:06.050 --> 14:07.750
Good night, ma'am.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.050
I didn't even dream last night.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.760
I was... really hoping I would, you know?

15:12.761 --> 15:15.000
I thought maybe it would...

15:18.200 --> 15:19.750
I just...

15:21.500 --> 15:23.900
Someone did this to me.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.650
Took away my whole life.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.700
And I can't do anything.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.100
I got you a coffee and a tea this morning.

15:37.550 --> 15:39.450
Which would you prefer?

15:39.500 --> 15:42.900
- I don't...
- C'mon, go ahead. Try them.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.900
Um, I like this one. This one
tastes like grass trimmings.

15:58.950 --> 16:00.250
There you go.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.756
Number 1, you remembered what
grass trimmings taste like.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.200
And 2, you figured out
you're a coffee person.

16:08.193 --> 16:09.743
You're not helpless.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.850
We're defined by our choices.
You just don't remember yours.

16:14.450 --> 16:18.250
So, keep trying new things.
See what your body remembers.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.800
Or make new choices.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.300
The more you make, the
less helpless you'll feel.

16:23.950 --> 16:28.150
Even if nothing ever comes back,
you can still find yourself.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.950
That one's odd.

16:33.850 --> 16:37.336
- That square on her shoulder.
- Yeah, I was eyeing that too

16:37.337 --> 16:38.942
because everything else is so ornate.

16:38.943 --> 16:40.717
- That is opaque.
- If Jane had a

16:40.718 --> 16:43.586
tattoo before our unsub
drugged her and did the rest,

16:43.587 --> 16:45.000
they'd have to cover it up.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.650
And that would give us a clue to her past.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.800
How do we see under that tattoo?

16:49.850 --> 16:52.442
I laser scanned Jane's
body across all spectrums,

16:52.443 --> 16:55.950
so maybe I can just cycle back
down, to all the infrared channels.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.250
- All done.
- Tasha,

16:57.251 --> 16:58.818
I thought we were meeting in my office.

16:58.819 --> 17:01.650
No, the doc thought it might be a
good idea for her to see all this.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.400
Really?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.599
Jane.

17:07.849 --> 17:09.500
Who am I?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.200
Hey, wait, what is this one right
here? I haven't seen that one yet.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.098
Oh, that's 'cause it's
behind your left ear.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.343
It's only about an inch big,

17:21.344 --> 17:23.207
and I sent it off to translate...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.000
So you speak Chinese?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.850
That's an address and a date. Today's date.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.800
- That was right under our nose.
- Behind her ear, actually.

17:44.850 --> 17:48.150
- Gives us a time?
- No, just an address and today's date.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.450
399 White St, apartment 7.
Right in the heart of Chinatown.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.780
All right. Do we know who lives there yet?

17:54.781 --> 17:56.674
Chao Zheng. Transportation engineer.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.911
He's a Chinese national,
here on an H-1B visa.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.227
- He's doing some work for GE.
- Any flags?

18:01.228 --> 18:03.200
No. He's been here three
years. Spotless record.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.500
Let's go pay him a visit.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.050
Patterson, nice work. Keep
working on the tattoos.

18:07.550 --> 18:10.749
- Hey, you have to stay here.
- No. No, I'm coming with you.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.850
- No, you're not.
- The clue is on my body.

18:12.851 --> 18:15.030
With today's date and a
language I speak and you don't.

18:15.031 --> 18:16.497
- I should be there.
- That's not your call.

18:16.498 --> 18:18.600
What if I'm not just the messenger?

18:18.650 --> 18:21.500
What if there's something
I'm supposed to hear, or see?

18:21.706 --> 18:24.899
I mean... maybe... maybe I'll remember
something. Maybe... maybe he knows me.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.451
I am not gonna take you out in the field.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.120
- Am I under arrest?
- No, you're not.

18:28.121 --> 18:32.149
Look, we'd all feel a lot more comfortable
if you stayed in protective custody.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.778
Well, I would feel a lot more
comfortable if I could ask this guy

18:34.779 --> 18:36.258
why his address is stamped on my head.

18:36.259 --> 18:38.650
So unless you are detaining me, I'm going.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.150
Take her with you.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.150
No, stay in the car.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.900
- That wasn't the deal.
- I don't care.

18:57.901 --> 19:00.117
I'm not gonna take you upstairs
until everything is secure.

19:00.118 --> 19:01.518
Stay in the car.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.966
Reed, keep your eyes on her.
Don't let her out of your sight.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.700
Zapata, you're with me.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.400
That's the one.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.700
Excuse me, sir. Do you mind if we come in?

19:25.150 --> 19:26.900
Anyone else in this apartment?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.300
Hey, hey! Sit down.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.254
Sir, Chao, he lives here?

19:37.700 --> 19:40.100
Chao? I don't understand!

19:41.150 --> 19:43.350
- I think you might need her here.
- Yeah, I know.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.250
I'll go get her.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.400
Forget something?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.900
Can you please come upstairs
with me for a minute, ma'am?

19:53.950 --> 19:55.750
Since you asked so nicely...

19:58.350 --> 20:01.150
Can I come too, or you want
to roll the window down for me?

20:04.950 --> 20:06.350
To your right, Jane.

20:11.725 --> 20:13.125
Do your best.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.900
All right. He said he
just moved in last week.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.050
He hasn't seen Chao since yesterday.

20:23.100 --> 20:27.100
Okay, okay. He wants to apologize
for letting his student visa lapse.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.400
He said he... he said he
didn't get the forms in time.

20:30.450 --> 20:32.750
- So, on the visa... look, thank you.
- Okay.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.400
Is that Chao's room?

20:40.350 --> 20:42.150
- Yes? Yes or no?
- Yes.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.450
Thank you.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.700
- Thank you. Jane...
- Okay.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.500
Yeah.

20:47.550 --> 20:52.050
Anything in here... familiar?
Do you recognize anything?

20:52.100 --> 20:53.500
Um...

21:06.349 --> 21:07.549
No.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.900
No.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.400
Just go outside.

21:12.448 --> 21:14.692
- Just wait outside for us.
- No, no! Wait, no.

21:14.693 --> 21:17.733
- I should be... I should be in here.
- Jane, just wait in the hall. Hallway.

21:20.050 --> 21:22.450
Reed, I want in there.

21:30.287 --> 21:32.450
Looks like somebody's got a hobby.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.018
- Meth?
- Not enough ventilation.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.500
Zapata, can you get us onto that computer?

21:39.550 --> 21:42.129
I'm not gonna lie. I'm a bit
hurt you had to ask me that.

21:47.650 --> 21:49.324
You guys smell that?

21:50.500 --> 21:53.152
- Rotten egg?
- Yeah, along with mole, rat

21:53.153 --> 21:56.363
and a couple mystery smells
I'm trying hard not to identify.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.601
Reed, look at that saw dust.

21:59.294 --> 22:00.661
That's not good.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
Uh! That rotten egg is sulfur.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.824
Plastic explosives.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.300
_

22:14.350 --> 22:17.950
_

22:21.400 --> 22:23.600
You got to see this,
Mayfair. Weller was right.

22:23.650 --> 22:25.599
There was another tattoo under the square.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.750
- How's your Latin?
- Not great. But I know what this is.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.400
- _
- For God and country.

22:31.401 --> 22:33.470
It's a Navy SEAL tattoo.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
What are you doing?!

22:53.550 --> 22:56.000
- Are you okay?
- You get out of here!

22:56.050 --> 22:58.813
- I think you need to come with me.
- She's not going anywhere!

22:58.912 --> 23:00.776
- Come on, let's just go.
- Who's this?

23:00.777 --> 23:02.543
This bitch just broke in.

23:02.637 --> 23:05.199
Hey, easy, all right? The...
the... the door was opened, I was...

23:05.200 --> 23:09.599
I know the law. This my
property. You an intruder.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.750
There's never been a female Navy SEAL.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.900
Do you think they'd
advertise it if there were?

23:13.950 --> 23:16.009
No, but her fingerprints came back clean.

23:16.010 --> 23:18.450
If she was Navy, she'd be in our database.

23:18.451 --> 23:20.200
Not if she was Special Ops.

23:20.250 --> 23:22.272
Let's just talk about
this, okay? Let's not...

23:30.800 --> 23:32.600
You okay?

23:49.193 --> 23:50.481
I'm in.

23:52.825 --> 23:55.549
That's weird. This computer has
been almost completely wiped.

23:55.550 --> 23:57.099
There's just an upload
tool and a timer delay.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.654
So what's it gonna upload? When?

23:58.655 --> 24:00.399
Single video file, in about 4 hours.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.757
So let's see it.

24:04.450 --> 24:05.809
That's Chao.

24:06.574 --> 24:08.293
Speaking Chinese.

24:10.336 --> 24:11.900
Yeah, I'm going.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.950
Jane! Stop!

24:41.100 --> 24:42.350
Stop!

24:44.194 --> 24:45.547
Stand there.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.050
- What happened?
- Um...

24:52.175 --> 24:53.400
What happened?

24:53.450 --> 24:56.399
That... that one was roughing
up his wife, and then...

24:56.400 --> 24:58.950
and then this one came in,
I don't know, I don't know.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.742
Okay. I asked you to stay upstairs.

25:01.743 --> 25:02.999
What was I supposed to do?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.600
- I wanted to help, I...
- We could have handled that.

25:11.394 --> 25:13.093
It's fine. He's fine.

25:13.156 --> 25:14.856
All right? He's not dead.

25:14.924 --> 25:16.872
We'll get him an ambulance.

25:17.124 --> 25:21.443
We found something
upstairs. I need your help.

25:28.456 --> 25:34.048
He says, "Today's action, to hijack
a politician, the mother of exiles,

25:34.049 --> 25:38.587
is just the start. America has
ignored Chinese suffering for too long.

25:38.619 --> 25:44.269
America sits back and savors its freedom,
while atrocities are committed, and, ah...

25:44.299 --> 25:46.196
families are destroyed.

25:46.343 --> 25:51.793
Today, America has felt the
pain of... loss and suffering.

25:56.174 --> 25:58.531
Today the reckoning has begun."

25:59.550 --> 26:00.950
He's speaking in the past tense.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.350
- When was the video set to upload?
- Three and a half hours.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.556
What's he's gonna use those explosives for?

26:05.557 --> 26:08.707
We got three and half hours
to find that kid and stop him.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.240
All right, the video we found
says the target is a politician.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.472
Mother of Exiles.

26:20.473 --> 26:22.923
So my guess is, Senator Judith Moore.

26:22.962 --> 26:25.459
She's the only marquee
female politician in New York.

26:25.460 --> 26:28.859
Moore's pro-immigration
and pro-Chinese trade.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.960
Mother of exiles, it lines up.

26:30.961 --> 26:34.852
Dial in Hostage Rescue. I want
her and any other target of value

26:34.853 --> 26:36.616
put on lockdown immediately.

26:36.621 --> 26:38.091
Are we in his phone yet?

26:38.092 --> 26:39.464
His phone seems to be off.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.912
All of his emails are in Chinese.

26:41.913 --> 26:45.250
Mayfair, we got to get everyone
who speaks Chinese to look at it.

26:45.251 --> 26:47.400
I want all eyes on those emails.

26:47.450 --> 26:49.741
Our translators are struggling with it.

26:49.742 --> 26:53.950
Apparently it's a very rare
dialect, called Wenzhou.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.642
The Chinese call it the devil's language.

26:56.643 --> 26:58.062
The devil's language?

26:58.063 --> 26:59.900
I can tr... I can translate.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.976
I wanna stop this guy as much as you do.

27:04.443 --> 27:05.693
Please.

27:05.793 --> 27:06.993
Fine.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.399
Send it through to Reed's tablet
now. Give us all of his emails.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.837
Patterson, root Chao's
phone. Turn it back on.

27:13.838 --> 27:15.594
Get me his position, now.

27:17.187 --> 27:18.387
Come on.

27:18.556 --> 27:19.787
Got it. Brooklyn.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.843
Flatbush and Livingston, headed west.

27:21.881 --> 27:24.167
All right, let's go. We're moving out.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.450
_

27:42.425 --> 27:43.875
How you holding up?

27:45.525 --> 27:46.925
I don't know, I...

27:47.218 --> 27:49.618
I don't really have a frame of reference.

27:51.718 --> 27:54.468
If someone wanted to stop
Chao, why not just call you?

27:54.550 --> 27:56.750
Why did they have to tattoo it on my body?

27:56.751 --> 27:58.351
I don't know yet.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.900
But Chao trusts someone, they sold him out.

28:00.901 --> 28:02.914
So we find him, take him alive...

28:03.237 --> 28:05.065
he'll have some answers for us.

28:06.708 --> 28:08.906
How do I know how to do all this?

28:09.300 --> 28:10.949
The Chinese, the fighting...

28:10.950 --> 28:13.169
A lot of people know martial arts, but...

28:13.781 --> 28:15.504
what I just saw,

28:16.600 --> 28:18.857
you didn't learn that at your local dojo.

28:22.362 --> 28:24.362
So is that why they chose me?

28:24.843 --> 28:26.456
Because of what I can do?

28:26.969 --> 28:29.202
Or do you think it's just...

28:30.137 --> 28:31.937
But why me?

28:32.162 --> 28:33.942
I don't know yet, Jane.

28:35.524 --> 28:36.925
We're in the zone.

28:36.926 --> 28:39.837
Best tower tracking could do, was
get us within a couple hundred feet.

28:39.838 --> 28:41.913
All right, everyone keep your eyes peeled.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.374
There!

28:50.449 --> 28:51.649
Right there!

28:51.650 --> 28:54.200
He's wearing the same jacket in
the picture from his apartment.

28:54.201 --> 28:55.453
He's heading down to the subway.

28:55.454 --> 28:56.979
Reed, pull over here.

28:58.146 --> 29:01.100
Zapata, you stay street
side. Keep your eyes on Jane.

29:01.101 --> 29:02.750
And tell me if doubles back up here.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.500
- All right?
- Please, wait, please.

29:04.501 --> 29:06.048
Please take him alive.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.469
He's the only one that
might have some answers.

29:09.275 --> 29:10.845
We'll do our best.

29:50.150 --> 29:51.689
Yep, I got him.

30:00.225 --> 30:01.888
_

30:05.512 --> 30:07.162
We've been made.

30:07.334 --> 30:09.660
- You sure?
- Yeah I'm sure.

30:28.550 --> 30:30.392
'Scuse. We're slowing down.

30:33.506 --> 30:34.785
Damn!

30:48.703 --> 30:50.991
We can't pull any of the pins.
It's wired to auto-detonate

30:50.992 --> 30:52.356
if the trigger's tampered with,

30:53.312 --> 30:55.934
- You're sure?
- Positive. I've seen this circuit before.

30:56.949 --> 30:58.850
Get everyone to the back of the train.

31:00.675 --> 31:02.476
Where you going?

31:04.950 --> 31:07.699
FBI! I need everybody to
get to the back of the train.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.600
Now! I need everybody to move. Now! Now!

31:09.650 --> 31:11.866
Come on, let's go! Move! Move! Move!

31:19.200 --> 31:20.849
I got everybody in the back of the train.

31:20.850 --> 31:22.900
You're not gonna try to
disarm that bomb, are you?

31:23.050 --> 31:25.150
I'm gonna rip away some of the C4.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.750
If I can't disarm it, I'm gonna reduce it.

31:29.150 --> 31:30.350
That's insane!

31:30.400 --> 31:32.796
If you've got a better idea, you tell me!

31:33.900 --> 31:35.366
That's enough!

31:53.050 --> 31:54.270
Weller?

31:54.325 --> 31:55.527
Weller?!

32:15.387 --> 32:16.637
You okay?

32:16.668 --> 32:18.168
Not really.

32:29.450 --> 32:30.750
What happened?

32:30.800 --> 32:32.050
We lost Chao.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.300
He uncoupled the car that we
were in and tried to blow us up.

32:34.350 --> 32:36.200
- Oh, my God.
- He was improvising.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.550
He knew that we were onto him.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.800
That was not the target.

32:38.801 --> 32:39.987
Look, I've been reading his emails,

32:39.988 --> 32:42.625
and I... I think I stumbled
onto why he's doing this.

32:43.055 --> 32:45.655
He just found out his mother was
killed in a Chinese prison camp.

32:45.656 --> 32:47.654
He and his sister had been
begging the US government

32:47.655 --> 32:49.850
for years to help with her
release, but they didn't.

32:49.851 --> 32:51.132
His mother?

32:51.722 --> 32:53.023
"Mother of exiles."

32:53.024 --> 32:54.249
It's from a poem.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.900
"Give me your tired, your poor,

32:55.912 --> 32:57.362
Your huddled masses".

32:57.450 --> 33:00.650
All right? It's on a plaque on the
city's biggest tourist attraction.

33:00.700 --> 33:01.900
Mother of exiles.

33:01.950 --> 33:04.282
Chao's gonna blow up the Statue of Liberty.

33:08.549 --> 33:09.749
Come on.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.356
Mayfair, we're almost at Battery Park.

33:19.357 --> 33:20.961
We need a boat to get
out to Liberty Island.

33:20.962 --> 33:22.087
We're on it.

33:22.150 --> 33:24.550
Also, the Mayor had an
event out there today,

33:24.600 --> 33:28.350
but NYPD pulled him to deal
with the subway explosion.

33:28.351 --> 33:30.892
That explains the politician
reference in Chao's video.

33:30.893 --> 33:33.213
That's good for us, right? Island
security should be airtight.

33:33.214 --> 33:36.014
Yeah, plastic explosives
won't set off a metal detector.

33:36.093 --> 33:39.052
You can still smuggle that detonator
and an iPhone, belt buckle...

33:39.053 --> 33:41.800
But he'll still have to reassemble
it somewhere out of sight.

33:41.850 --> 33:43.050
So we're gonna find him before he does.

33:43.100 --> 33:47.252
I've shut down ferry service,
and started evacuating the island.

33:47.253 --> 33:49.941
Fine. But he's had a solid head start.

33:50.266 --> 33:51.719
He's out there already.

33:51.775 --> 33:54.296
Weller, take me off speakerphone.

33:55.012 --> 33:56.600
- Good.
- You were right.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.540
The black square was
obscuring another tattoo.

33:59.598 --> 34:02.450
An eagle holding a trident and anchor.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.389
We think she might have been a SEAL.

34:04.768 --> 34:06.868
That'd explain a few things.

34:17.525 --> 34:18.737
Hey. What are you doing?

34:18.750 --> 34:20.475
- Jane, get back in the car.
- No, I'm coming with you.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.937
No! You're not. Stay here.

34:21.956 --> 34:23.460
I saw the map on Zapata's tablet.

34:23.460 --> 34:24.818
Liberty Island is 14 acres.

34:24.819 --> 34:27.170
You have three agents, you
need another set of eyes.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.917
I can't let that man kill
a bunch of innocent people.

34:29.918 --> 34:33.226
And if he knows anything about
what's really going on, who I am...

34:34.125 --> 34:36.775
Please, you know I can help.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.090
Arms up.

34:44.456 --> 34:47.255
- You stay by my side.
- Okay.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.200
Zapata, you search the crowd.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.950
Reed, you got perimeter.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.207
I'll take the statue. Jane's with me.

35:03.208 --> 35:07.127
Emergency, please
evacuate to the East Dock.

35:14.037 --> 35:16.593
Ranger, I'm with the FBI.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.050
Jane... give me a look, give
me a look. Give me a look!

35:27.100 --> 35:28.828
- You've been hit.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

35:28.829 --> 35:30.149
- Keep pressure on that wound.
- I'm okay.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.000
Okay? Keep pressure on that.

35:32.001 --> 35:33.201
Just go!

35:33.302 --> 35:34.667
Go get him.

35:37.263 --> 35:38.813
I'm in pursuit of the suspect.

35:38.814 --> 35:40.732
He's dressed as a park ranger.

35:42.075 --> 35:43.300
I'm heading up the stairs.

35:43.301 --> 35:44.886
On me, now.

36:36.967 --> 36:38.367
I'll kill him.

36:38.369 --> 36:41.169
Drop the gun or I'll kill him.

36:41.344 --> 36:42.900
She's not gonna do that Chao.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.250
- Drop it!
- You kill me,

36:45.251 --> 36:46.912
she has to kill you.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.550
- Weller...
- Chao,

36:49.551 --> 36:50.801
listen to me.

36:50.802 --> 36:53.643
- This is now way to honor on your mother.
- It's too late.

36:53.644 --> 36:56.094
There's no going back now.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.852
I don't know if I c... can.

37:30.312 --> 37:31.997
You missed two.

37:32.330 --> 37:33.754
Do it again.

37:33.755 --> 37:36.052
I remember something.

37:37.568 --> 37:39.862
I remember something.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.850
Director Mayfair, there's
no doubt in my mind,

38:06.900 --> 38:09.500
she's special forces
or intelligence trained.

38:09.550 --> 38:11.350
Her skill set is way too specialized.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.050
High level language abilities.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.434
Hand to hand proficiency off the charts.

38:15.837 --> 38:19.787
Her marksmanship under
pressure. She's professional.

38:21.637 --> 38:23.287
She saved my life today.

38:23.381 --> 38:26.450
- She also recovered her first memory.
- What is it?

38:26.451 --> 38:28.371
Running an outdoor shooting course.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.359
It's just a fragment, but it
lines up with what we saw today.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.150
Who is this woman?

38:34.018 --> 38:35.518
I don't know yet.

38:35.519 --> 38:36.761
What I do know,

38:36.762 --> 38:40.191
is one of those tattoos helped to
save the lives of hundreds of people.

38:40.299 --> 38:41.999
And she's covered in them.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.275
She might be just the most
important resource we've ever had.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.990
And you risked losing her by
letting her in the field today.

38:47.991 --> 38:51.040
She saved your life, and she
triggered her first memory.

38:51.066 --> 38:53.628
We're one step closer to
finding out who she is,

38:53.629 --> 38:55.162
and who did this to her.

38:55.163 --> 38:56.850
I'd say the risk paid off.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.782
I still don't get why. I mean,

38:59.825 --> 39:01.600
if our unknown subject is a good guy

39:01.608 --> 39:03.250
who wanted us to stop Chao,

39:03.251 --> 39:04.708
why not call it in?

39:04.714 --> 39:07.450
You know, why go to the
trouble of kidnapping Jane,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.469
and then covering her in those tattoos.

39:09.493 --> 39:13.234
These tattoos are as big
a mystery as Jane Doe is.

39:13.262 --> 39:15.864
We have no way of knowing
where they'll lead.

39:16.651 --> 39:17.856
Yeah.

39:17.857 --> 39:20.018
Well, one thing's for sure...

39:20.600 --> 39:22.666
someone likes playing games,

39:22.987 --> 39:25.122
and it's just the beginning.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.200
Look, it's been a long day.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.950
Everyone go home, and
we'll regroup tomorrow.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.503
Thank you, Mayfair.

39:32.588 --> 39:34.149
Yes, ma'am.

39:41.150 --> 39:44.200
_

39:45.050 --> 39:46.494
_

39:46.495 --> 39:48.250
_

39:48.251 --> 39:50.662
_

39:50.663 --> 39:52.401
_

39:54.850 --> 39:56.700
_

39:57.000 --> 40:00.100
_

40:09.455 --> 40:11.482
So, did Chao say anything?

40:11.956 --> 40:14.206
No. No.

40:14.587 --> 40:16.687
He just got out of surgery, so,

40:16.862 --> 40:19.147
we will question him tomorrow.

40:19.193 --> 40:20.693
Okay.

40:23.324 --> 40:25.322
How you feeling, Jane?

40:26.081 --> 40:27.931
Physically, okay.

40:27.932 --> 40:31.682
I'm a little banged up, but
they said my arm's gonna be fine.

40:31.856 --> 40:35.622
Um, emotionally, I... I... ah...

40:36.531 --> 40:38.081
I don't know.

40:41.762 --> 40:44.712
How did you know that
I could make that shot?

40:47.518 --> 40:48.968
I didn't know.

40:50.575 --> 40:52.643
I took a chance on you.

40:56.725 --> 40:58.975
None of this feels real.

41:00.487 --> 41:01.687
Jane,

41:03.620 --> 41:05.446
you're gonna be okay.

41:06.345 --> 41:09.604
- I promise.
- I don't know what that feels like.

42:18.645 --> 42:22.195
Everything happened the
way it was supposed to.

42:22.245 --> 42:25.245
No, you were supposed to die.

42:25.295 --> 42:27.895
You for your sister, that was the deal.

42:27.945 --> 42:29.895
I won't tell them anything.

42:29.945 --> 42:31.795
I swear.

42:32.295 --> 42:33.895
I know.

42:45.845 --> 42:47.545
Once I insert this,

42:47.595 --> 42:49.795
you will be permanently erased.

42:49.845 --> 42:52.045
Everything that you have been,

42:52.095 --> 42:53.995
will cease to exist.

42:54.045 --> 42:55.695
I know.

42:56.545 --> 42:58.744
But it's my only choice.
