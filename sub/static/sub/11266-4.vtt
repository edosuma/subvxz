00:02.085 --> 00:03.044
Previously on 90210:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.505
Peter and I have been trying
to conceive

00:04.546 --> 00:05.881
for the past few years.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.925
We'd like to buy your eggs.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.050
I'm sorry. What?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.303
I think it's best
that we just end things.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.721
I'm pregnant.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.388
You're not pregnant.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.140
Stay away from my son.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.142
There's ten songs in here

00:17.184 --> 00:18.727
that are gonna
be huge hits.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.104
Pretending you wrote a song you
actually stole from a dead man.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.063
Okay, well, that's not...

00:22.105 --> 00:24.733
I have a recording of Javier
singing it

00:24.775 --> 00:25.818
six months ago.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.902
Stay away from me.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.403
I'm not gonna tell anybody

00:28.445 --> 00:29.530
that we hooked up.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.323
Cannon did not reject me!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.323
He raped me!

00:34.242 --> 00:35.911
Naomi, hey!

00:35.953 --> 00:38.330
Hey, hey, what'd
you take, huh?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.414
Hey, look at me.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.749
Naomi!

00:49.633 --> 00:50.885
What happened?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.596
You fell asleep again.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.766
Wow. Having people shove tubes
down your throat

00:57.808 --> 01:00.602
and suck out your insides
really takes it out of you.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.355
Well, the doctor said I could
take you home when you woke up.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.524
Yeah, now that
he's had his fun.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.736
I feel disgusting. (groans)

01:08.777 --> 01:10.404
Ew, I look like a Cullen.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.531
You look good.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.035
I brought you
some clothes.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.870
Here you go.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.162
Thank you.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.292
How are you feeling?

01:24.334 --> 01:27.086
Silver, I told you,

01:27.128 --> 01:28.797
it was an accidental overdose.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.466
I was having trouble sleeping,
and I took some pills.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.301
I still can't believe
this happened.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.094
And I can't believe
that you've been going

01:35.136 --> 01:36.095
through this alone.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.598
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.474
Given the circumstances,

01:39.516 --> 01:41.643
I probably wouldn't have
believed me either.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.771
You have to do something.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.522
You have to come forward.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.816
I just want to
put it behind me.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.443
I don't see that happening.

01:50.694 --> 01:51.904
I mean, look at you.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.489
What? You said I look good.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.991
I'm serious.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.285
(sighs)

01:58.326 --> 02:01.413
The worst part about this whole
ordeal was not having

02:01.455 --> 02:03.164
anyone to talk to.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.500
Now that you're here,
it makes all the difference.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.710
Really.

02:06.752 --> 02:07.962
Okay.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.839
Just don't tell
anyone, okay?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.340
I don't...

02:12.382 --> 02:13.341
Please?

02:13.383 --> 02:15.302
Promise me.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.768
Okay, I promise.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.065
You like this shirt?
Uh-huh.

02:28.107 --> 02:30.567
You don't think the
collar's too big?
Uh-uh.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.986
No, I mean,
it's cool, right?

02:32.027 --> 02:33.194
'Cause Annie looked at me

02:33.236 --> 02:35.447
and she said I look
like a turtle.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.365
Then I looked in the
mirror and I said,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.701
"If that's a turtle, that's the
flyest turtle I've ever seen."

02:39.743 --> 02:40.953
I think I'm ready.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.871
Ready for what?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.581
Dude, come on.
Don't make me say it.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.712
Oh... Really?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.547
Yeah. What?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.382
You're acting all surprised.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.968
No, no, no, I'm not.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.719
But... I mean,

02:57.761 --> 02:59.138
I guess I am.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.305
What made you decide?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.557
I don't know.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.225
Dixon, you're an all right guy,

03:04.267 --> 03:06.353
and we love each other,

03:06.394 --> 03:08.229
and, you know, blah-blah-blah.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.818
Yeah. Never mind.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.487
No, Ivy, look,
it's cool, all right?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.323
It's-it's actually awesome

03:18.365 --> 03:20.034
'cause I'm ready, too.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.327
Really ready.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.328
Whatever.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.579
It's the shirt.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
Got you all hot and bothered,

03:25.789 --> 03:27.582
I know it.
Shut up.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.587
Who's that?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.882
Um, it's nobody.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.466
I'll be right back.
Nobody?

03:40.512 --> 03:41.596
Hi, Dixon.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.183
What are you doing here?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.018
I really need to talk to you.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.729
About what,
you're pregnant again?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.106
Okay, look,
I know that you think...

03:51.148 --> 03:52.440
No, I don't want

03:52.482 --> 03:53.775
to hear it, Sasha.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.569
You're a liar,
you're crazy.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.320
I just want you to stay the hell
away from me.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.785
So...

04:03.827 --> 04:05.120
what did nobody want?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.955
Um...

04:06.997 --> 04:09.374
she's actually an ex-girlfriend.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.626
Oh.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.962
I mean, she
doesn't go here.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.589
Nah. She's older.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.966
Well, how long were
you guys dating for?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.343
Can we not talk about it?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.845
She's not even worth
the breath.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.222
Fine. That's cool.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.981
Yeah, but, um,

04:33.023 --> 04:34.983
so we'll figure out later,
you know,

04:35.025 --> 04:36.777
a couple details.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.113
We'll talk about it later.
Okay.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.034
Hey.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.035
What's up?

04:45.077 --> 04:46.828
Not much.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.580
What, uh, what were
you guys talking about?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.498
Oh, just stuff for the benefit
this weekend.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.834
It's really coming together.
Good.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.502
(squeals)
Oh, there's Ade.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.796
I'll see you
in class, okay?
Okay.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.009
Victor, if you could call me
back as soon as possible,

05:01.051 --> 05:03.804
I really, really need
to talk to you.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.847
Okay, bye.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.307
Everything okay?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.349
Um, yeah.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.810
It was just business stuff.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.936
Okay.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.188
So, what was this
incredibly important question

05:13.230 --> 05:14.564
you wanted to ask me?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.650
Well, you know how
the breast cancer benefit

05:16.691 --> 05:17.943
I'm organizing
is this weekend.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.611
And the guys have
agreed to participate

05:19.653 --> 05:20.988
in a bachelor auction.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.906
Yeah, Navid told me.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.866
He's been giving me
Zoolander all morning.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.119
Ooh, I was really
afraid of that.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.870
Anyway, I was hoping,

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
since you're now
a huge YouTube star

05:30.413 --> 05:31.790
and the biggest
celebrity I know,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.709
that you'd sing the song
from Javier's memorial.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.003
I mean, I don't want

05:36.044 --> 05:37.796
to take advantage of our
friendship or anything.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.839
I just thought...

05:38.880 --> 05:39.881
No, no, no.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.675
I'd love to perform.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.718
I'd just rather sing
a different song if that's cool.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.553
That one brings up
some really bad memories

05:45.595 --> 05:47.055
of the accident.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.099
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.558
Um, whatever you want to sing.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.560
I wouldn't miss it.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.438
(growls)
You're the best.
(chuckles)

05:57.232 --> 06:01.402
"If music be the food of love,
play on, give me excess of it;

06:01.444 --> 06:05.699
that surfeiting, the appetite
may sicken, and so die."

06:07.159 --> 06:08.202
What?

06:08.243 --> 06:09.410
Nothing.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.830
I've just never had anyone read
Shakespeare

06:11.872 --> 06:13.581
to me on a date before.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.916
Is it working?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.543
It is working.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.669
Yeah?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.757
Wait till I break out
the MoliÃ¨re.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.178
Ah. Well, we may need
a hotel room for that.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.930
(phone rings)

06:28.972 --> 06:30.431
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.227
Hello?

06:33.268 --> 06:34.769
Annie, hi, it's Katherine.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.063
I heard you missed

06:36.104 --> 06:38.439
a couple days of work last week,
and I just wanted

06:38.481 --> 06:39.900
to make sure
everything was okay.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.400
Oh, yeah. No, um, I'm sorry.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
I just got busy.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.240
Look, I realize I put you in an
incredibly awkward position,

06:46.281 --> 06:47.949
and I totally understand

06:47.991 --> 06:49.910
why you wouldn't want
to sell me your eggs.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.410
I just hope you're still
comfortable enough

06:51.452 --> 06:53.121
to keep the internship.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.622
You're doing a great job,

06:54.664 --> 06:55.957
and we love having you.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.293
No, I am.
I really like the job.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.294
Great.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.419
So, we'll see you Wednesday?

07:00.461 --> 07:01.420
Yeah.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.298
See you then.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.424
What was that?

07:05.466 --> 07:07.261
Nothing. I just missed
a couple days of work.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.262
Sorry about that.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.471
No, it's okay.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.099
Unfortunately,
I gotta go, though.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.308
Alas alack.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.644
I'll try to stop by
after class tomorrow.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.273
Through yonder door I'll knock.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.565
I would like that.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.947
(chuckles)

07:29.199 --> 07:30.533
Oh.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.412
(doorbell rings)
Oh.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.834
What...?

07:39.876 --> 07:41.128
DIXON:
What the hell, Liam?

07:41.169 --> 07:42.629
I said you could crash.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.005
I didn't say I'd
be your valet.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.673
What's going on?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.884
Well, Liam's going to be
staying in my room

07:47.926 --> 07:48.969
for a couple days

07:49.010 --> 07:50.845
until he finds
a new place to live.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.681
Mom said it was cool,
if it's cool with you.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.142
(clears throat)

07:55.183 --> 07:56.517
Cool.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.854
I'll stay out of your way.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.731
No, no, you don't have to.
It's fine.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.525
I mean, if you need a place
to stay, you should stay.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.194
Thanks.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.872
Please, Victor.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.624
I am truly sorry
for what I did.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.960
I promise you, I will never
perform that song again.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.505
On the contrary, you will
perform it many more times.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.799
What do you mean?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.384
Well, I'm your manager now,

08:29.426 --> 08:30.969
and as your manager,
I suggest

08:31.011 --> 08:32.511
we strike
while the iron is hot.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.474
I'm not really sure
I need a manager.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.640
You absolutely do.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.726
Oh, and instead
of the usual ten percent,

08:38.768 --> 08:40.227
I'll be taking 50%
of your earnings.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.563
Now if you're not happy
with these terms,

08:43.606 --> 08:45.317
you know,
we can go our separate ways.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.319
Of course, I'd be forced
to tell the press

08:47.361 --> 08:49.737
how you stole your song
from my beloved dead nephew.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.239
But hey, listen, maybe
you'll bounce back.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.074
Look at Milli Vanilli.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.243
I understand the one that didn't
OD is doing quite well.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.582
Okay, you can be my manager.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.001
Ah, that's great.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.669
Hey, listen, I even
booked your first gig.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.004
Saturday night.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.797
Birthday party
for a bigwig A&amp;R guy.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.383
So wear something short
and tight.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.801
I can't do it this Saturday.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.470
I'm performing
at a cancer benefit.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.097
It's a favor for a friend,
please.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.598
Oh, okay, sure.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.727
As long as that favor
comes with major exposure

09:20.768 --> 09:22.770
and a $10,000 paycheck.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.272
What?
Ten G's, baby.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.274
That's what this gig pays.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.942
But this is for charity.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.111
Let me explain something
to you, sweetheart.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.446
You work for me now.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.739
I'm not in the charity business.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.282
I'm in the moneymaking business.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.369
And you're gonna be
number one moneymaker.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.519
MAN: More to your left,
more to your left. Got it.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.188
Perfect. Okay,
I'm really loving this,

10:05.230 --> 10:08.525
but it's gotta be,
like, twice the size.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.361
And, like, way less glitter
on the word "breast."

10:11.403 --> 10:12.695
It feels weird.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.198
Hey, honey, they ran out of
lights for the centerpieces.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.493
(gasps) No! I told them to
double the order yesterday.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.495
So, I went out
and I got some more.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.538
Oh, thank you.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.997
No problem.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.874
Oh!

10:24.916 --> 10:25.917
Hey, Silver.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.920
Hey. I have something
to show you.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.880
We just got these printed up.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.006
You're the headliner.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.050
Cool, right?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.885
I hear that's how
Rihanna got her start.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.679
Okay, I made that up,
but it could be true.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.931
It looks nice.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.016
Yeah, and it's almost
completely sold out.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.352
I'm talking about
standing room only.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.395
Except for you.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.397
Our headliner will
have her chair.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.484
Listen, I have kind of an
awkward question for you.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.652
I was wondering
if I would be able

10:52.693 --> 10:54.571
to get paid for singing.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.157
What?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.783
I know it's a charity thing,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.202
but maybe you could scrape
together something, you know?

11:01.244 --> 11:03.580
Like $10,000?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.042
Are you serious?

11:09.628 --> 11:10.962
No, Ade, I can't pay you.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.339
Look around--
everyone's volunteering.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.551
I know, and I'm so sorry;
I feel so bad. It's just...

11:16.593 --> 11:19.262
I have another job
that does pay

11:19.304 --> 11:20.763
and my manager
is insisting.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.392
So there's no way?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.853
No. There's no way.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.524
Then I guess I can't do it.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.954
Hey, have you
seen my earrings?

11:44.996 --> 11:46.914
Hmm?
Oh. There they are.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.876
Oh, wait, excuse me...
these are my earrings.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.629
Yeah, but they look
so much cuter on me.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.088
How's the job hunt going?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.216
Mm! It's so different from
the last time I looked.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.677
I mean, there are so many
great Web sites to search on.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.637
Although femalehotjobs.com--

12:00.679 --> 12:02.263
not the kind of work
I'm looking for.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.891
Yeah. (laughs)

12:04.932 --> 12:06.643
So, do you think you're
gonna find something?

12:06.685 --> 12:07.644
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.811
Preferably something
that doesn't

12:08.853 --> 12:10.230
require me to wear latex.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.273
Okay, gross image.
Thank you.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.817
(doorbell rings)
Oh, that's
gotta be Charlie.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.986
Can you let him in?
I gotta finish getting ready.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.112
Oh. Yeah. Go, go.
Thank you.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.330
What's Annie up to?

12:29.999 --> 12:32.168
Uh...

12:32.210 --> 12:33.670
Actually, she's seeing this guy.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.838
They're going out
on a date tonight.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.006
That cool with you?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.883
Yeah. I don't care.

12:38.925 --> 12:39.884
Okay.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.722
Who is he?

12:43.762 --> 12:46.391
I don't know.
Haven't met him.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.934
Think he's
in college-- UCLA.

12:47.975 --> 12:48.976
(scoffs)

12:49.018 --> 12:50.687
Their football team sucks.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.148
Ah, good for her.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.404
I think
I want something to drink.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.530
You want something
to drink?

13:00.572 --> 13:01.615
From the kitchen?

13:01.656 --> 13:04.325
Uh, nah, I'm... good.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.035
Have a good time.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.579
Thanks. We will.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.881
Do you have a second?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.799
What's up?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.304
I think I'm ready
to sleep with Dixon.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.766
Wow.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.060
Okay.

13:31.102 --> 13:34.021
I'm really glad you're coming to
talk to me about this first.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.983
Second. Actually, I already
talked to the UPS guy.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.486
He thinks I should
definitely go for it.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.404
Kidding.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.864
This is a big step.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.326
Have you really
thought it through?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.369
Yeah.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.829
I mean, I always knew
I wanted my first time to be

13:50.871 --> 13:53.416
like, with someone
I loved, and...

13:53.458 --> 13:56.503
and I know it sounds
really corny and everything...

13:56.544 --> 13:57.920
Oh, no, it's not corny.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.298
Oh, it sounds corny.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.677
But it's okay; Dixon
makes me a little corny.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.095
In a good way.

14:06.137 --> 14:10.725
And I'm ready.
I just don't...

14:10.767 --> 14:12.435
What?

14:13.894 --> 14:17.023
Like, remember when
I first started surfing,

14:17.064 --> 14:19.693
how I'd wipe out
and I'd eat sand?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.404
I really don't
want to eat sand.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.615
Babe...

14:25.657 --> 14:27.241
Oh, but Dixon has
all this experience,

14:27.283 --> 14:31.078
'cause he dated
this older woman and...

14:31.120 --> 14:34.207
I don't know, I just really
don't want to suck at it.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.125
You won't.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.211
Just be there.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.547
Don't overthink,
don't judge...

14:40.588 --> 14:42.131
just be there.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.097
Stop looking at me
like that.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.475
Sorry.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.646
So, do you have protection?

14:56.688 --> 14:59.399
No, I thought... he does that.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.484
No, you should always
bring protection.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.610
You just never know.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.739
Let's see...

15:05.780 --> 15:08.825
Okay, I have lubricated,
not lubricated.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.785
Ultra-thin,
ultra-ribbed.
Oh, my God.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.579
Mom...
Extra-strength.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
Yeah, okay,
you know what?
Super-thin... Mint?

15:14.997 --> 15:16.499
I've got glow-in-the dark.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.792
Good-bye!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.670
Thank you guys so much
for agreeing to do this.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.130
The bachelor auction is going to
be the highlight of the night,

15:23.172 --> 15:25.508
and we are gonna raise
a ton of money.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.510
So who's gonna buy you
tomorrow night, Navid--

15:27.552 --> 15:28.595
your mom or your dad?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.346
(guys laughing)

15:30.388 --> 15:33.433
Actually, your mom has put in
a pretty large preemptive bid.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.142
(guys groaning, laughing)

15:35.184 --> 15:36.770
Hilarious.
Okay, okay.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.104
Listen up, all right?

15:38.145 --> 15:41.315
I really want to start the
auction with a bang, so...

15:41.357 --> 15:44.694
I thought we could open
with a little dance number.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.112
You serious?
Dancing.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.364
(all talking at once)

15:48.406 --> 15:50.700
Hey, come on, you guys!
Chill out! Come on!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.368
We'll do it.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.328
Hold up.
What kind of dance?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.373
I mean, 'cause... I can
do a pretty mean "Worm."

15:57.415 --> 15:59.333
(guys agreeing, encouraging)
Let's see it.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.294
Uh...

16:01.335 --> 16:03.337
(all shouting, clapping)

16:05.256 --> 16:08.217
Okay, okay, stop.
Stop the worming.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.719
Sit down.
This is what I'm thinking.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.888
No worms but, uh...

16:11.930 --> 16:13.556
how about a group dance?

16:14.682 --> 16:15.809
Choreographed.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.852
IAN:
Sorry I'm late.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.229
Oh! Speaking of.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.816
This is
your choreographer-- Ian.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.536
(quietly):
Hey, Dixon.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.663
(thumps on bed)

16:36.704 --> 16:38.247
You up?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.457
No.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.878
Annie should be
home by now.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.463
Maybe you should call her,
you know?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.631
Make sure she's okay.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.132
I would, but we've
already established

16:48.174 --> 16:50.009
that I'm fast asleep.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.219
Now shut up and go to bed.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.513
Come on, man.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.890
How well do you know
this guy she's dating?

16:55.932 --> 16:56.975
(front door opens)

16:57.016 --> 16:59.978
There, see?
She's home. Alive.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.145
It's a miracle.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.730
Now go to sleep.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.901
I think I need
a glass of water.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.035
Oh! Sorry.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.246
Oh, hey, I didn't
realize anyone...
I was just
getting a drink...

17:19.288 --> 17:21.248
I mean, I can leave...
No, you go ahead.
It's fine.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.250
(laughs anxiously)
You first.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.127
Thanks.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.014
Well...

17:36.055 --> 17:37.932
Good night.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.601
Yeah. Good night.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.943
(groans)

17:48.985 --> 17:51.070
Yep.
She's still into me, man.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.446
I can tell.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.242
She's just scared.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.702
I gotta show her

17:57.744 --> 18:00.287
that I'm not the dangerous
guy she thinks I am.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.956
I gotta show her...

18:01.998 --> 18:04.042
my soft side...

18:04.083 --> 18:05.960
you know?

18:07.461 --> 18:08.796
I hate you.

18:11.173 --> 18:15.094
Got it: sound check's at 4:00;
show's at 6:00, the Sunset Mark.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.556
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.558
Hey.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.602
Hey! I'm so glad
you could meet me here.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.062
I'm sorry I couldn't
meet for lunch.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.313
I just have a million things
to do before the show.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.523
That's okay.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.483
I just, uh, wanted to talk
to you about something.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.944
Yeah. What's up?

18:30.985 --> 18:33.738
Well, uh, I feel like there was
some kind of misunderstanding.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.323
Silver mentioned that you,
uh, demanded money

18:36.365 --> 18:38.325
to perform at the
breast cancer benefit.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.369
I didn't demand it,
I just...

18:42.789 --> 18:44.999
Look, um... my new manager

18:45.041 --> 18:47.752
wants me to get paid
for every gig and...

18:47.794 --> 18:50.421
he really knows what's best.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.840
Yeah, but,
Silver's your friend, Ade.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.175
Yeah-- this isn't about
friendship, this is my career.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.845
Yeah, but...
Navid!

18:57.887 --> 19:00.347
I've given up
everything for this.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.643
All right?
This is a huge opportunity.

19:03.684 --> 19:07.981
I really wish you would stop
judging me and just support me.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.607
I'm going to be late
for sound check.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.608
I gotta go.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.739
It looks amazing.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.282
I know. Right?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.910
I mean, I'm not one
to brag but, uh,

19:20.952 --> 19:22.286
I'm kicking some
serious ass.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.039
Yeah, I think you're
gonna raise a fortune.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.707
Yeah.
Oh, which reminds me--

19:26.749 --> 19:28.417
the donation check
your mom wrote--

19:28.459 --> 19:30.086
it actually bounced.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.211
Oh.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.546
It's probably just
a mistake but...

19:32.588 --> 19:34.214
Yeah, probably
a screwup at the bank.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.050
I'll tell her
and she'll sort it out.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.011
Cool. Thanks.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.013
All right...
I want to help.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.597
What can I do
that doesn't involve

19:41.639 --> 19:43.016
breaking a nail or a sweat?

19:43.057 --> 19:44.934
Well, uh, you and Annie

19:44.976 --> 19:46.853
can organize outfits
for the bachelors...

19:46.894 --> 19:48.062
I'm not working with her.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.563
And I'm sure she doesn't
want to work with me.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.482
After all, I am a murderer.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.031
Annie, I'm really sorry
I said that.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.407
I was in a bad place.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.742
In a bad place?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.410
You were at your 18th
birthday party, Naomi.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.079
You were having the
time of your life.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.831
Yeah, well, I was
going through a lot.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.541
Like what?!

20:08.582 --> 20:11.752
Did the caterers run
out of Cristal?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.596
I... don't have to help.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.515
I will buy a table.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.562
You should really
forgive her.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.856
Why? She was
horrible to me.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.775
She was horrible
to all of us.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.986
Frankly, I don't even understand
why you've forgiven her.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.532
And, a-five, six, seven, eight.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.034
Cross, turn, kick, ball change.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.493
Okay,
"kick, ball change" means

20:44.535 --> 20:47.080
go from your right foot
to your left foot, gentlemen.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.123
Oh, man!
Dude...

20:49.165 --> 20:50.332
Can we take a break?

20:50.374 --> 20:52.126
Dixon just kick, ball changed me
in the groin.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.586
Uh, absolutely not.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.795
From the top!

20:54.837 --> 20:57.215
Okay, five, six, seven, eight.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258
Kick, ball change--
pop! pop!

20:59.299 --> 21:00.593
Very good, Dixon, very good.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.137
Liam, just make sure
you keep your head up, okay?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.847
Oscar, good.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.933
Navid, all right!
Very nice!

21:06.974 --> 21:09.518
Teddy, uh, just try to stick
with the counts, okay?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.020
Watch Navid.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.147
Yeah, watch
the master.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.150
Okay, so, it's right,
left, circle hips...

21:16.192 --> 21:17.735
I got it. I got it.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.986
Okay, well, loosen
up, all right?

21:19.028 --> 21:22.615
Guys, right, left,
circle hips.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.701
Teddy, come on,
right, left, circle hips.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.494
Circles, Teddy.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.704
You can do it, okay?

21:28.746 --> 21:31.498
Just relax
and loosen up.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.333
What-What is wrong with you?

21:33.375 --> 21:34.919
Look, sorry if I can't dance,

21:34.961 --> 21:37.588
but I'm not a frickin'
faggot like you.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.095
Screw you, Teddy.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.949
Okay, uh, how about everybody go
get some lunch, take a break?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.085
What the hell was that?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.211
He was provoking me.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.840
Silver, wait.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.092
Look, I just got frustrated.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.927
Well, I get frustrated, too,
sometimes,

22:24.969 --> 22:28.014
but I don't turn
into a homophobic jerk.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.147
IVY: Thank you.
DIXON: Thank you.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.898
MAN:
Next.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.901
I can't believe Teddy
went all Mel Gibson.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.320
Yeah, I know.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.488
It was out of
nowhere, too.
Right.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.240
Well, I guess I won't
be bidding for him

22:46.282 --> 22:47.241
at the bachelor auction.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.202
I guess I'll have
to settle for you.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.661
Well, you better bring
your wallet

22:50.703 --> 22:52.330
'cause I'm killing
that opening dance number.

22:52.370 --> 22:55.166
I'll bring my wallet.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.793
And then I'll take
you back to my house

22:57.835 --> 23:00.546
since my mom's out of town,

23:00.587 --> 23:02.756
and maybe we could...

23:02.798 --> 23:04.133
try something I
haven't done before.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.135
Yeah, we can.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.013
I mean, unless, you know,
unless you don't want to.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.389
No! No, no, no, no, I do!

23:11.431 --> 23:12.558
I do, I do!

23:12.599 --> 23:13.642
Okay, calm down. Geez.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.228
(laughs)

23:15.269 --> 23:17.355
And don't feel bad, okay?

23:17.395 --> 23:19.899
A lot of people have to pay
for their first time.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.400
You jerk. Come on.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.610
(laughs)

23:28.074 --> 23:29.158
(knocking)

23:29.200 --> 23:30.368
Come in.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.375
What are you doing here?

23:37.415 --> 23:39.793
Supporting my supremely
talented girlfriend.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.214
I'm sorry about earlier.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.799
You're right,
this is your career.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.885
And I totally got your back.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.263
Thank you.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.389
Yeah.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.268
You're on in ten.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.228
Hey, after you sing,
spend some time with
that birthday boy.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.479
You know, rub up
against him.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.648
Could do a lot
for your career.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.068
And I hear he's got a
thing for young girls.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.195
Um, Victor, this is
my boyfriend Navid.
Hi.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.406
Navid, this is Victor,
my manager.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.116
Hi. And don't eat too much.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.743
I don't want you to bust out
of that sexy little outfit.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.748
That's the guy?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.750
That's the amazing manager?

24:19.792 --> 24:23.421
Yeah. I know he's a little crude

24:23.461 --> 24:24.755
but it's not about
personality, okay?

24:24.797 --> 24:25.923
It's about my career.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.342
No, there's nothing that
sleazeball can do

24:28.384 --> 24:30.177
for your career
but destroy it, Ade.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.512
Navid, you don't understand

24:37.101 --> 24:39.979
You're right. I don't.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.651
Ah, I gotta go.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.028
Navid, please.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.113
(footsteps retreat)

24:51.824 --> 24:53.451
Wow. Are you

24:53.491 --> 24:54.660
expecting someone?

24:54.701 --> 24:55.786
Just you.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.579
I'm trying to make
mushroom risotto.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.458
Dixon said that's your favorite.

25:00.498 --> 25:01.625
But it doesn't really

25:01.667 --> 25:03.294
look like the picture,

25:03.336 --> 25:05.463
and I gotta be honest,
it smells kinda funky.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.588
You're cooking for me?

25:06.630 --> 25:07.965
Trying to.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.301
Set your expectations low.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.136
And what brought this on?

25:12.178 --> 25:16.432
I just...
I wanted to show you that...

25:16.474 --> 25:17.975
You have me all wrong.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.311
Yeah, I might have had
my troubles in the past,

25:20.353 --> 25:21.687
but I'm not a dangerous guy.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.772
It's not like
trouble follows me around.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.274
Fire!

25:25.316 --> 25:27.318
Fire!

25:30.154 --> 25:31.571
(both gasping)

25:34.200 --> 25:35.826
And you were saying

25:35.868 --> 25:36.994
about trouble
not following you...

25:37.036 --> 25:38.662
Hey, that was not...

25:38.704 --> 25:39.997
(laughs)

25:40.039 --> 25:43.167
It's very sweet that
you tried to cook for me

25:43.209 --> 25:45.419
even though it does smell
incredibly funky.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.587
(sighs)

25:47.629 --> 25:48.672
Look, the real reason

25:48.714 --> 25:50.799
that I wanted to crash
with Dixon...

25:50.841 --> 25:53.386
was to be near you.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.264
I miss you.

25:57.306 --> 26:00.100
I want another chance.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.645
(doorbell rings)

26:03.687 --> 26:05.856
I should get the door.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.363
CHARLIE:
Is it a bad time?

26:12.405 --> 26:14.698
ANNIE:
No, it's not
a bad time.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.534
Uh, come in.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.205
What are you doing here?

26:21.247 --> 26:23.165
What are you...?
Wait, you two...?

26:23.207 --> 26:25.042
How do you know Annie?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.836
We've been seeing each other.

26:29.547 --> 26:30.964
This is the college guy
you've been dating?!

26:31.006 --> 26:33.509
Wait, I'm confused.
How do you two know each other?

26:33.551 --> 26:34.801
We don't.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.807
We're brothers.

26:40.849 --> 26:44.728
Wait. Like, brothers, like,
you used to hang out?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.688
Like... bros?!
No.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.568
Same father, different mother.

26:50.608 --> 26:51.818
Liam's my half brother.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.325
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out tonight

26:58.367 --> 27:01.412
to help us raise money for this
incredibly important cause.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.831
As some of you may know,
my mother passed away

27:04.873 --> 27:07.418
from breast cancer, so
this is very near to my heart.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.546
Anyway, thank you all
for coming tonight.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.465
To start things off, we...

27:12.506 --> 27:15.092
(siren wails)
Stop! Stop everything!

27:15.134 --> 27:16.176
Stop right now!

27:16.218 --> 27:17.470
What? What's going on?

27:17.511 --> 27:18.596
I'm sorry, ma'am,

27:18.636 --> 27:21.599
but we're gonna have to shut
this party down!

27:21.639 --> 27:22.849
What are you
talking about?

27:22.891 --> 27:26.228
Well, according to the Beverly
Hills fire code,

27:26.270 --> 27:27.938
this party's just too damn hot!

27:29.106 --> 27:30.732
Right, guys?!

27:30.774 --> 27:32.025
(pop music plays,
audience cheering)

27:55.257 --> 27:56.800
(whooping and cheering)

28:27.039 --> 28:30.543
So, did you guys
grow up together?

28:30.584 --> 28:31.918
No.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.171
Um, I'd maybe see him
once a year.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.922
He lived with his mom
in Brooklyn.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.592
And I grew up in Connecticut
with my mom and stepdad.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.720
I mean, I didn't even know
about him until I was ten.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.138
Then what is it?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.265
I mean, what happened
between you two?

28:46.392 --> 28:47.767
I used to spend summers

28:47.809 --> 28:50.396
at my uncle's lake
house in Minnesota.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.065
One summer, Liam
was there, too.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.983
I was bored and I was a punk

28:55.025 --> 28:57.819
and I stole the neighbor's
credit card and went

28:57.861 --> 29:00.155
on a shopping spree-- bought
skateboards, Jet Skis.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.949
When I got caught up...

29:02.991 --> 29:04.535
I blamed it on Liam.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.205
I planted the credit cards
on him.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.916
Like I said,
I was a punk.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.335
He got in a lot of
trouble, and it was bad.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.921
I should have stepped up and
took the blame, but I didn't.

29:17.423 --> 29:22.261
I've tried to apologize,
but he won't forgive me.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.221
I guess I don't blame him,

29:24.263 --> 29:27.641
but... it's been a long time,
you know?

29:32.396 --> 29:34.940
Whoo! Whoo!
Strut your stuff!

29:34.981 --> 29:36.358
$220.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.902
$220 from the girl in green!

29:38.944 --> 29:43.699
Do I hear $230 for a sexy
bachelor from across the pond?!

29:43.741 --> 29:44.742
Say something British.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.743
(British accent):
Hello, ladies.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.202
(audience whoops)

29:47.244 --> 29:48.328
Take it off!

29:48.370 --> 29:49.162
$300!

29:49.204 --> 29:50.205
$300.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.082
Higher, higher.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.584
$300 going once...

29:53.626 --> 29:54.834
going twice...

29:54.876 --> 29:56.253
Come on.
He's worth it.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.380
Sold to the pretty lady
in tie-dye.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.423
Yes!

29:59.465 --> 30:00.840
(applause)

30:02.635 --> 30:05.512
Our next bachelor up
for auction is Liam!

30:05.554 --> 30:08.181
(audience whooping)

30:08.223 --> 30:12.770
Liam enjoys surfing,
pumping iron and curling up

30:12.811 --> 30:14.146
at home with a good book.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.188
(quietly):
I didn't write that.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.231
You didn't write
anything.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.566
How about it, ladies?!

30:17.608 --> 30:18.942
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

30:18.984 --> 30:19.943
Get out there.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.236
Whoo! Take your
shirt off!

30:21.278 --> 30:23.905
He is our dark, brooding
bachelor, sexy and mysterious.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.783
We'll start the bidding at $100.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.618
$100.
We got $100 right here.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.911
$110.
$110. The girl in green
is on the hunt!

30:29.953 --> 30:30.954
$120.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.080
$150!

30:32.122 --> 30:33.624
Um, $200!

30:33.666 --> 30:34.625
$250!
Oh!

30:34.667 --> 30:35.542
$350!

30:35.584 --> 30:36.627
Wow!

30:36.669 --> 30:37.795
$350.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.963
Going once...
Higher, higher!

30:40.005 --> 30:41.256
going twice...

30:41.298 --> 30:42.466
He's worth it.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.550
Sold!

30:43.592 --> 30:44.968
(shrieks)

30:45.010 --> 30:46.303
Yeah!

30:46.345 --> 30:47.638
I can't believe it!

30:47.680 --> 30:50.432
I can't believe I won you!

30:50.474 --> 30:52.100
Oh, I'm so happy.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.143
Congratulations.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.191
Okay, here's your cut.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.734
Nice job tonight,

31:00.776 --> 31:01.860
by the way.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.280
Victor, this is only $2,000.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.825
I thought you said we were gonna
split it 50-50.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.702
Oh, uh, I changed my mind.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.828
We're gonna go 80-20.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.245
That's not fair.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.122
Well, maybe you'd prefer I tell
everybody at the party

31:14.164 --> 31:15.207
where you got your songs?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.295
Our next bachelor up
for auction...

31:20.337 --> 31:22.339
How much for Mr. Matthews?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.550
(whooping)

31:24.591 --> 31:25.467
Mr. Mathews!

31:25.509 --> 31:27.845
All right,
no, settle down.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.515
Sorry, ladies,
but our next bachelor

31:31.557 --> 31:35.060
is equally charming
and way more legal.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.688
And he's yours for a price--
Mr. Dixon Wilson.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.690
(whooping)
Dixon!

31:39.732 --> 31:41.400
We will start the bidding

31:41.441 --> 31:43.026
(Ivy whooping)
on this smokin' hot bachelor

31:43.068 --> 31:46.363
who enjoys hanging out
with friends,

31:46.405 --> 31:47.698
mixing beats and looking fly.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.200
Yeah, whoo!
Whoo!

31:50.242 --> 31:51.368
A dollar.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.661
All right! That's the way

31:52.703 --> 31:54.162
to start off the bidding!

31:54.204 --> 31:56.206
We have a bid of one dollar!

31:56.248 --> 31:59.167
$100!
$100 to the lady in the back.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.293
Do I hear one $110?!

32:01.587 --> 32:02.755
Yeah, $110.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.548
$150.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.716
$160.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.885
$170.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.636
$400.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.056
$400 and...
Sold!

32:13.098 --> 32:15.434
To Ivy for $400!

32:17.102 --> 32:18.896
Thank you.
No problem.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.274
Congratulations.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.360
That was weird.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.570
I told you she's crazy.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.822
Our next bachelor
is our final bachelor

32:28.864 --> 32:30.407
for the evening.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.826
This is gonna be Navid Shirazi!

32:32.868 --> 32:35.203
Whoo, Navid!
Yeah!

32:35.245 --> 32:39.792
He's got heart, he's got brains
and he's got personality.

32:39.833 --> 32:43.086
This exotic West Bev High
heartthrob is the whole package.

32:43.128 --> 32:46.715
Get out your umbrellas, ladies,
'cause it's I-ranian men!

32:46.757 --> 32:49.927
We'll start the bidding at $100.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.011
Let's hear it. $100?

32:53.806 --> 32:55.140
Take another walk.
Huh?

32:55.181 --> 32:57.100
Take another walk.
Oh.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.101
How about $90?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.103
Who's got $90 on this stud?

33:00.145 --> 33:02.439
Girl in green,
this is your moment.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.776
We'll go with $80.

33:05.818 --> 33:06.902
$2,000.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.069
Wow.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.112
(audience gasps)

33:09.154 --> 33:10.614
You're the best, Ade!

33:10.656 --> 33:11.782
Sold!

33:11.824 --> 33:15.118
For the insanely generous sum
of $2,000

33:15.160 --> 33:17.663
to Adrianna Tate-Duncan!
All right, Ade.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.832
(applause and cheering)

33:19.873 --> 33:21.040
(mouthed)

33:24.336 --> 33:26.004
This is every penny
I made tonight.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.046
I'm so sorry I chose work

33:27.088 --> 33:28.131
over our friendship.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.549
It'll never happen again.

33:29.591 --> 33:33.553
This... this means a lot.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.768
Uh... I hope
I'm worth it.

33:39.810 --> 33:40.853
(both laugh)

33:40.894 --> 33:42.688
You're totally worth it.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.153
I still hate
your manager.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.072
Let's not talk
about him, okay?

33:55.742 --> 33:57.452
Andy!

33:57.494 --> 33:59.162
Let's count the uniforms.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.122
Make sure we're not missing any.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.124
Hey!
What?

34:03.166 --> 34:06.003
Look,
I just wanted to apologize.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.838
I'm not the one
you have to apologize to.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.005
Come on, Silver.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.674
No. I've had enough, Teddy.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.009
It's over.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.262
(frustrated grunt)

34:18.056 --> 34:19.641
Stay the hell away from me!

34:19.683 --> 34:21.434
I don't want to be
around you, trust me.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.936
I'm serious, man.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.437
You come near me again,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.523
Look, just because you can't
deal with who you really are,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.190
don't take it out on me.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.248
Hey, hey, hey!

34:43.289 --> 34:44.583
Knock it off!

34:44.623 --> 34:46.083
Knock it off, I said!
Get up!

34:46.125 --> 34:48.754
Get off of him!
All right, get up.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.463
What the hell is going on here?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.300
Huh? What is
this about?

34:55.719 --> 34:58.304
(panting)

34:59.472 --> 35:00.640
It's about nothing.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.813
It's nothing.
It's nothing?

35:06.855 --> 35:08.941
Yeah.
Well, maybe you guys
can figure it out when
you're in detention

35:08.982 --> 35:11.150
'cause that's where you're gonna
be for the next two weeks.
What?!

35:11.192 --> 35:13.987
That's not fair.
Or we can go Principal Nowack's
Monday morning,

35:14.029 --> 35:15.864
and we can talk about
suspension-- whatever you want.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.909
(sighs)
Detention's fine.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.954
It's fine. Whatever.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.796
Liam.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.424
What?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.635
I'm really sorry.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.178
Obviously, I didn't know
that Charlie was your brother.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.014
I mean, I didn't even know

35:41.056 --> 35:43.182
that you had
a brother.
I don't.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.851
Look, what happened
between you guys

35:44.893 --> 35:46.185
was a long time ago,

35:46.227 --> 35:47.687
and he feels really bad.

35:47.729 --> 35:48.981
Stay out of it.

35:49.022 --> 35:51.357
He said that stealing
the credit card was...

35:51.399 --> 35:52.901
You don't know
what you're talking about.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.698
I'm gonna stop
seeing Charlie.

35:58.740 --> 36:02.035
I don't care what you do
or who you date.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.369
You were right.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.830
We're all wrong for each other.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.624
Oh, there you are.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.959
I thought I lost you.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.627
I'm going to need
a little leash

36:10.669 --> 36:11.878
for you or something.
Yeah.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.380
Um, are you ready to go?

36:16.424 --> 36:18.301
Yeah. Let's go.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.974
Awesome.
Great.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.309
That was an incredible night.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.644
It really was, Sil.

36:27.686 --> 36:30.022
Your mom
would be so proud.
(all laugh)

36:30.063 --> 36:31.564
Thanks.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.901
Mm, you guys
are the best.

36:34.943 --> 36:38.030
Um, I think we should say hi
to Naomi.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.405
ANNIE: No way.
ADRIANNA: Why?

36:39.447 --> 36:40.406
She's been awful, Silver.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.867
For no reason.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.326
Yeah, but she's going
through a lot.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.078
You keep saying
that, but

36:45.120 --> 36:46.997
I don't know what she could
possibly be going through

36:47.039 --> 36:48.414
to justify that behavior.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.004
Naomi.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.382
I can't believe it.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.591
What?

36:58.633 --> 36:59.592
About Cannon.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.931
You promised.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.850
They're your friends.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.061
Okay?
We're all your friends.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.564
I just, I feel
sick about it.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.773
It's so awful.

37:13.815 --> 37:14.858
Why didn't you tell us?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.609
Why...

37:16.651 --> 37:18.403
Because I don't want you
staring at me

37:18.444 --> 37:19.612
like you're staring
at me right now,

37:19.654 --> 37:21.364
with pity,
like I'm pathetic or something.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.909
This isn't pity, Naomi.
This is sympathy.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.077
It's love.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.953
This is us trying
to be your friends.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.621
This is anger.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.666
He's going to pay
for what he did to you.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.222
I can't believe you
only cost me $400.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.474
(whispering):
'Cause I was about
ready to drop a grand.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.727
(chuckling):
Well, uh...

37:50.769 --> 37:53.105
if you're satisfied
at the end of the night,

37:53.146 --> 37:54.647
maybe you can tip me.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.691
Get out of here.
(laughs)

37:56.733 --> 37:58.151
See you at my place.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.070
Right behind you.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.656
(engine starts)

38:03.698 --> 38:04.908
(sighs)

38:06.118 --> 38:07.410
Hey!

38:07.452 --> 38:09.996
Damn it, Sasha,
what the hell do you want?

38:10.038 --> 38:11.414
I need to talk to you.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.415
No.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.500
Come on, after this,

38:14.542 --> 38:16.086
I will leave you
alone, I promise.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.087
Fine. Talk.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.631
Not here.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.174
Please, just give me

38:21.216 --> 38:22.675
five minutes.
All right.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.094
Come on.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.347
(footsteps fading)

38:28.389 --> 38:29.849
What's wrong?

38:29.891 --> 38:31.768
Nothing.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.354
Nothing at all.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.483
(sighs)

38:38.524 --> 38:40.610
You okay?

38:40.652 --> 38:43.113
Oh, um, yeah. Just...
I was just paying some bills.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.864
So how was the bachelor auction?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.283
Oh, it was okay.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.451
Um, but actually, Mom,

38:48.493 --> 38:50.870
the check you wrote
for the charity--

38:50.912 --> 38:52.330
it-it bounced.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.207
Oh, uh, well, you know,
that's not a problem.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.708
I'll just give you some cash.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.002
Okay.

39:02.132 --> 39:05.384
Um...
you know what, Annie?

39:05.426 --> 39:07.137
I-I will get
it to you.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.347
It just might take me
a-a couple of days.

39:09.388 --> 39:12.058
What is going on, Mom?

39:12.100 --> 39:17.563
Money is a bit tight right now.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.732
Your dad's new job pays only
about half

39:19.774 --> 39:21.026
of what his old job did.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.694
But I-I mean, I thought...

39:22.735 --> 39:24.070
you had leads.
Yeah, well,

39:24.112 --> 39:26.447
not... so many, it turns out.

39:28.200 --> 39:32.411
I've been out of photography
for a long time, and...

39:32.453 --> 39:35.040
and not having a college degree

39:35.081 --> 39:37.042
is making things
more difficult

39:37.083 --> 39:38.877
than I anticipated.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.046
Look, Annie, I don't want
you to worry about this.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.048
Everything is
going to be fine.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.051
Your dad and I are going
to figure it out, okay?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.969
Okay.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.014
Okay.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.517
(dialing)

39:55.810 --> 39:57.770
(ringing)

39:57.812 --> 39:59.231
Annie?

39:59.272 --> 40:01.066
Hi, Katherine. I'm sorry.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.942
I hope I'm not calling too late.

40:02.984 --> 40:05.237
No, no, not at all.
What's going on?

40:05.278 --> 40:07.613
Well, I've been thinking
about your offer,

40:07.655 --> 40:09.741
and it's $20,000

40:09.782 --> 40:11.076
for my eggs, right?

40:11.117 --> 40:14.913
Oh, um... that's right.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.208
I'll do it.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.647
So?

40:41.689 --> 40:43.649
Look, I get that
you hate me.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.819
I do. I was
awful to you.

40:46.861 --> 40:47.987
And I am sorry.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.407
It's just that when we met,

40:50.448 --> 40:53.243
I had just gone through
a really bad breakup.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.162
And then you
broke up with me,

40:56.204 --> 40:58.998
a high school kid...

40:59.040 --> 41:02.752
and my ego just couldn't
take it anymore.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.087
And I snapped.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.464
That's what you want
to talk to me about?

41:06.505 --> 41:07.465
Okay.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.468
A few weeks ago, Eric--

41:10.509 --> 41:12.678
um, the guy
from the bad breakup--

41:12.720 --> 41:15.014
he got back in
touch with me,

41:15.056 --> 41:18.517
and, um...

41:18.559 --> 41:22.397
he told me
that he was HIV positive.

41:23.564 --> 41:27.360
And I got
tested and...

41:28.527 --> 41:31.530
...I am, too, Dixon.
