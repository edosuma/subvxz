00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:04.505 --> 00:06.217
Thanks for meeting me.

00:06.217 --> 00:08.299
I've asked you here
because I have an idea

00:08.299 --> 00:09.630
for a cool new invention,
and I need some funding.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.392
- Gotta run.
- Bye now.

00:11.392 --> 00:12.723
Not from you.

00:12.723 --> 00:16.227
I made a video to put on
that website Liftoff.

00:16.227 --> 00:17.598
If people like it,
they'll give me money

00:17.598 --> 00:19.400
to build more of
these things so
I can sell them.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.312
But before I put
the video online,

00:21.312 --> 00:22.523
I want your opinions.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.645
- Oh, sure.
- That's different.

00:25.696 --> 00:27.568
Just make it fast.

00:27.568 --> 00:29.740
In five minutes, I have
to wash off this face mask.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.244
The only thing I see on
your face is your face.

00:33.244 --> 00:34.705
It's a clear mask.

00:34.705 --> 00:37.368
Why would I want
to cover this up?

00:37.368 --> 00:38.579
Just tell me what you think.

00:38.579 --> 00:40.581
Ethan, always appreciate
your support.

00:40.581 --> 00:42.463
Rachel, I know I can
count on you

00:42.463 --> 00:44.425
to tell the truth,
even if it hurts.

00:44.425 --> 00:46.337
Faster.
Getting drowsy.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.758
Case in point.

00:47.758 --> 00:50.381
My name is Harley Diaz.

00:50.381 --> 00:53.514
I'm about to talk to you
 using my latest invention.

00:53.514 --> 00:55.556
I call it the Harley Cam.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.310
Because my name is Harley.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.642
The Harley Cam
 is a body-mounted,

01:01.642 --> 01:04.644
gimbal-based
 video recording device.

01:04.644 --> 01:05.686
Watch this.

01:08.739 --> 01:10.691
Oh, boy. Dizzy.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.457
Wouldn't this be better
if you were standing up?

01:18.699 --> 01:21.372
So hope I can count on
 your investment.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.704
I'm still working on
the ending.

01:23.704 --> 01:24.795
What do you think?

01:24.795 --> 01:27.708
The Daphne part
was fun.

01:27.708 --> 01:30.471
No. It's horrible.
It was 20 seconds long,

01:30.471 --> 01:33.384
but now I feel like
I'm 40 years old
and my life is over.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.346
You need more sizzle.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.638
Cool videos really do
attract investors.

01:37.638 --> 01:40.391
It's the reason I put a down
payment for a condo on Mars.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.394
Come 2058, I'm gonna
be livin' large.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.396
You need to film something
that really shows off

01:45.396 --> 01:46.817
what the camera can do.

01:46.817 --> 01:49.440
Like, take it to
a big party or sky diving.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.403
Mom and Dad are never gonna
let me go skydiving.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.825
I'm the kid most likely to take
care of them when I'm older.

01:54.825 --> 01:57.498
- Yeah, I'm not doing that.
- True.

01:57.498 --> 01:59.540
If you absolutely
had to choose

01:59.540 --> 02:01.542
between scallions
and mushrooms,

02:01.542 --> 02:03.504
- which would it be?
- Mushrooms.

02:03.504 --> 02:05.506
No, wait. Scallions.
No, wait, I don't care.

02:05.506 --> 02:06.747
( phone chirping )

02:06.747 --> 02:09.509
Time to wash off my mask.

02:09.509 --> 02:11.422
She's not wearing
a mask, is she?

02:11.422 --> 02:12.843
No. She's just
trying to avoid us.

02:12.843 --> 02:14.755
Guys, help me out here.

02:14.755 --> 02:17.428
I'm having an omelet bar
for my quinceañera on Saturday,

02:17.428 --> 02:18.849
and I can only choose
ten toppings.

02:18.849 --> 02:21.642
It took me all day yesterday
to eliminate bacon bits.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.854
Lost in the second bracket
to ham cubes.

02:23.854 --> 02:27.478
Never mind. I can't
put this on you. Ugh!

02:29.610 --> 02:31.692
Georgie's quinceañera.

02:31.692 --> 02:34.615
That would be perfect for
showing off the Harley Cam.

02:34.615 --> 02:37.698
I could have her wear it while
we do the big family dance.

02:37.698 --> 02:39.620
But she's not doing
a big dance.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.742
She's not even
having a party.

02:41.742 --> 02:44.625
Just an omelet bar brunch
with some carefully
considered ingredients.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.628
That's a sweet plan if you're
retiring from the post office,

02:47.628 --> 02:51.712
but this is the most important
moment in a young Latina's life.

02:52.793 --> 02:55.636
I have to convince her
to do a big party.

02:55.636 --> 02:58.429
- Georgie deserves
her moment in the sun.
- And...

02:58.429 --> 03:00.471
And natural light
would be ideal

03:00.471 --> 03:02.563
for showing off the Harley Cam.
Just sayin'.

03:02.563 --> 03:05.726
You're almost as transparent
as Rachel's fake mask.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.959
I've gotta go with
tomato for the omelet bar.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.672
Everyone knows tomato
is king of vegetables.

04:11.672 --> 04:14.715
- I thought it was a fruit.
- Oh, please, I can't
go through this again.

04:14.715 --> 04:18.879
Look, this brunch
is fine and all,

04:18.879 --> 04:20.641
but you've been waiting
15 years for your quinceañera.

04:20.641 --> 04:21.841
You deserve more than
an omelet bar.

04:21.841 --> 04:24.805
You mean an omelet bar
and a pancake bar?

04:24.805 --> 04:26.557
That just seems showy.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.650
Come on. Don't you
realize how lucky we are?

04:29.650 --> 04:31.982
We get a sweet 16
a year before everyone else.

04:31.982 --> 04:33.944
You've gotta
do it up big.

04:33.944 --> 04:36.857
Well, what sort of
egg-based activity
would you go with?

04:36.857 --> 04:38.819
This is bigger than eggs.

04:38.819 --> 04:42.613
Don't you want a big,
fancy party like Rachel had?

04:46.827 --> 04:49.580
- Guys.
- Yah!

04:49.580 --> 04:51.502
( both yelling )

04:54.915 --> 04:56.677
I don't know.

04:56.677 --> 04:59.630
Over-the-top celebration?
That's just not me.

04:59.630 --> 05:02.763
But a quinceañera
is a big part of
our Latino heritage.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.846
It marks the transition
from girl to young woman.

05:05.846 --> 05:09.640
Besides, it's like going
to a prom that only
celebrates you.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.021
I appreciate the thought,

05:11.021 --> 05:12.853
but I just don't like being
the center of attention.

05:12.853 --> 05:15.025
My friend's grandfather
retired from the post office,

05:15.025 --> 05:16.987
he recommended
this brunch place.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.939
It'll be good.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.991
But don't you wanna do
the big choreographed dance

05:20.991 --> 05:23.574
with the whole family?

05:23.574 --> 05:24.945
Remember how much fun
we had at Rachel's?

05:24.945 --> 05:27.618
Yeah, it was really great.

05:27.618 --> 05:28.949
I even nailed
the Running Man,

05:28.949 --> 05:30.951
which is the only time
I've actually nailed running.

05:32.042 --> 05:33.954
I would hate to miss out
on that dance.

05:33.954 --> 05:35.836
But I can't
choreograph it myself,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.838
and I have no idea
what to wear.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.961
Look, being in a big family
is like being part of a team.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.634
And the team
is here to assist you

05:43.634 --> 05:44.965
with all your
quinceañera needs.

05:44.965 --> 05:46.967
Well, it can't be
any more stressful

05:46.967 --> 05:48.889
than picking out
these omelet fixings.

05:48.889 --> 05:51.642
Buh-bye. I'm in.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.646
Now I've just gotta get
the rest of the team in.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.652
Great news. Georgie's up for
a big quinceañera.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.944
And lucky you, you're
going to help me plan it.

06:03.944 --> 06:05.746
I'm kinda busy.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.658
I was gonna do this
for a while,

06:07.658 --> 06:10.040
then watch some TV.
I haven't even
taken my nap yet.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.953
Fine. I guess I'll just
have to decide

06:12.953 --> 06:14.705
which cute girls to invite.

06:14.705 --> 06:16.046
It'll be like Rachel's
quinceañera.

06:18.669 --> 06:19.840
Hi. I'm Rachel's brother...

06:19.840 --> 06:21.672
Ethan.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.765
Aw, forget it.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.058
Then again,
Georgie's my sister.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.810
Of course I'll help.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.772
She has a lot of
cute friends.

06:31.772 --> 06:33.684
Plus, they're close
to my age,

06:33.684 --> 06:34.855
so I actually
have a shot.

06:36.817 --> 06:37.978
Stop with the fan.

06:37.978 --> 06:40.611
Stop with the fan!

06:42.693 --> 06:44.865
Here. These two
are your problem now.

06:44.865 --> 06:47.658
Dad, there's a real
hurricane in Florida

06:47.658 --> 06:49.029
with the same name
as me.

06:49.029 --> 06:51.872
Hurricane Lewie.
How cool is that?

06:51.872 --> 06:53.794
I'm Hurricane Lewie.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.667
I'm Cold Front Beast.

06:56.667 --> 07:01.131
Cold, cold, cold. Cold!

07:01.131 --> 07:02.883
Since when do they
name cold fronts?

07:02.883 --> 07:04.965
They're twins. I had to
give him something.

07:04.965 --> 07:07.968
They've been tracking
Hurricane Lewie all day.

07:07.968 --> 07:10.100
Hey, why don't you boys
go in the back

07:10.100 --> 07:11.892
and watch
the Weather Network?

07:11.892 --> 07:14.104
Yeah!

07:15.766 --> 07:16.857
Why didn't I think of that?

07:16.857 --> 07:18.899
I still get credit for this.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.112
So it'd be great if you
help Georgie find a dress.

07:22.112 --> 07:24.905
Not interested.
Been there, done that.

07:24.905 --> 07:27.868
Okay, but she's choosing
dresses for all of us.

07:27.868 --> 07:29.910
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll look great

07:29.910 --> 07:31.782
in whatever she picks out.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.079
I see what you did there.

07:39.079 --> 07:40.751
Bringing my worst fear to life.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.755
And I respect it.
I'm in.

07:45.846 --> 07:49.049
Ladies, Georgie's going
to need a dance,

07:49.049 --> 07:52.092
and I think we all know
I'm the dancer in this family.

07:52.092 --> 07:54.184
Dancing one time
in a cow costume

07:54.184 --> 07:55.936
doesn't make you
an expert.

07:55.936 --> 07:57.938
Maybe not, but this does.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.151
Pow.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.063
Okay, you got moves.

08:03.063 --> 08:05.155
But this is also about
keeping people in line.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.867
Knowing how to crack a whip.

08:09.109 --> 08:10.991
What am I saying?
You're hired.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.073
Testing out my Harley Cam,

08:13.073 --> 08:16.036
because Georgie's quinceañera
is basically a go.

08:16.036 --> 08:18.749
We got a dress,
we got dancing,

08:18.749 --> 08:20.791
we got girls
5'4" and under.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.713
Last stop, the bank.

08:22.713 --> 08:24.795
Mom and Dad, who need
 to finance this party.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.216
Are you
out of your mind?

08:26.216 --> 08:28.759
Saturday is
five days away.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.010
It took me nine months
to plan Rachel's quinceañera,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.842
and she needed
a part-time job.

08:31.842 --> 08:34.054
But the whole family's
coming together for this.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.936
They're expecting more.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.808
Don't worry, our family's
used to disappointment.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.100
BEAST: Hey, there's
no cold fronts in summer.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.852
See?

08:46.196 --> 08:47.988
You've gotta throw Georgie
a big quinceañera.

08:47.988 --> 08:49.820
I don't understand.
Why does she want one now?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.822
For months, she's been saying
she doesn't want us

08:51.822 --> 08:54.154
- to make a big deal.
- Teenagers. What can you do?

08:54.154 --> 08:57.748
Look, we're sorry,
but it's just too late.

09:00.871 --> 09:03.123
Okay, what you're
about to see isn't pretty,

09:03.123 --> 09:06.927
but remember,
they made me go there.

09:06.927 --> 09:08.929
I understand.

09:08.929 --> 09:11.011
I think Georgie always knew
you liked Rachel better.

09:11.011 --> 09:13.844
Hey, we love all our kids
equally.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.806
As far as you guys know.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.768
You threw Rachel
a big party.

09:17.768 --> 09:19.099
Rented out a hall,

09:19.099 --> 09:20.891
spent I don't even know
how much,

09:20.891 --> 09:22.142
but for Georgie,

09:22.142 --> 09:24.234
and omelet bar
and a dozen toppings

09:24.234 --> 09:26.066
seems about right.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.028
Oh, wait.
You only went with ten.

09:28.028 --> 09:30.280
Those are premium toppings.
I've got seven kids.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.033
A brunch might not
be enough.

09:33.033 --> 09:35.035
It'll be fine.

09:35.035 --> 09:38.038
Maybe Georgie will find
a quarter in the booth.

09:38.038 --> 09:40.290
She can play the trivia machine
on the way out.

09:40.290 --> 09:43.203
Look, it's not that we don't
want to throw her a big party.

09:43.203 --> 09:45.085
But where would we do it
on such short notice?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.917
We could do it
in the backyard.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.169
Natural lighting would make
the camera look great...

09:49.169 --> 09:52.012
I mean, Georgie look great
on camera.

09:52.012 --> 09:54.805
It would finally make
your dad mow the lawn.

09:54.805 --> 09:56.136
I'll have Ethan do it.

09:56.136 --> 09:58.268
And not because
I like him least.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.140
I mean, he's one of
my top three.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.311
I shouldn't have said that.

10:01.311 --> 10:03.984
For a theme, we could do
"Under the Sea."

10:03.984 --> 10:06.066
- It would be perfect
for Georgie.
- How is that perfect?

10:06.066 --> 10:08.228
We own a marina store,
and we have five days
to prepare.

10:08.228 --> 10:10.861
Are you really gonna
question this?

10:10.861 --> 10:12.993
You're right.
It's perfect.

10:12.993 --> 10:14.945
Time for my dance lesson.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.157
Wow, I never thought
I'd say that sentence.

10:18.328 --> 10:19.870
Then it's off to
my dress fitting.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.912
And there's another one.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.004
I just hope
I don't look stupid.

10:24.004 --> 10:26.166
Now that one
I thought I'd say.

10:26.166 --> 10:29.800
Ooh, Candace Banks
just RSVP'd for your party.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.052
- Who?
- Really cute
girl in your grade.

10:32.052 --> 10:34.925
Also, don't be surprised
if the girls' swim team
makes an appearance.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.176
Who else are
you inviting?

10:36.176 --> 10:39.019
Teams or individuals?

10:39.019 --> 10:40.931
Hanna Tromer?

10:40.931 --> 10:43.023
She beans me every time
in softball.

10:43.023 --> 10:45.225
- And once in the cafeteria.
- But she smells like
strawberries.

10:45.225 --> 10:47.858
And she's shorter than this.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.867
Is that dancing,
or is that a bee in your pants?

10:56.867 --> 10:58.118
Dancing.

10:58.118 --> 10:59.910
I was giving you an out.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.281
Next time, take it.

11:01.281 --> 11:04.875
Now, we're going
to bring the hips.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.206
Where are we
bringing them from?

11:06.206 --> 11:08.088
Because mine are not working.

11:08.088 --> 11:10.340
How about we try
something simple?

11:10.340 --> 11:12.252
The family dance
involves me,

11:12.252 --> 11:15.055
so it's got to be
poppin'.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.386
Do I have to do
the hair flip?

11:16.386 --> 11:18.098
I've got so much;
once it's in my face,

11:18.098 --> 11:19.930
it's hard to find
my way out.

11:19.930 --> 11:23.013
The hair flip's not
supposed to be easy.
Hit it.

11:27.397 --> 11:29.149
This dress is ridic.

11:29.149 --> 11:31.311
Actually, I really
like this one.

11:31.311 --> 11:33.904
Not for you.
For me.

11:33.904 --> 11:36.236
But I thought you were
supposed to match
your dress to mine.

11:36.236 --> 11:39.079
Exactly. That's why
we're changing yours.

11:39.079 --> 11:41.161
Keep up, Georgie.
And here are your shoes.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.170
Well, look at you,
quinceañera girl.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.093
Doing a dress rehearsal
before your big day?

11:53.093 --> 11:55.295
Not that you need it.

11:55.295 --> 11:57.968
- This feels awkward.
- Really?
It doesn't look it.

11:57.968 --> 12:01.181
Here. Try it with
the giant camera
strapped around your waist.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.185
Don't forget to smile.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.150
I gotta say, I think
we have a real knack

12:10.150 --> 12:11.982
for decorating
on a budget.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.114
Just don't tell Georgie
you bought that flat screen

12:14.114 --> 12:15.986
when she told us she
didn't want a big quinceañera.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.447
Yeah, I don't know
about these.

12:17.447 --> 12:20.280
Oh, come on.
They'll be fine.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.282
It's a great photo op,
guaranteed crowd pleaser.

12:22.282 --> 12:25.075
Yeah, nothing says
blossoming into womanhood

12:25.075 --> 12:27.207
like an octopus
with a face hole.

12:29.129 --> 12:31.421
This is Ron Storm
with Diaz Action News.

12:31.421 --> 12:33.463
I'm reporting live from
what seems to be

12:33.463 --> 12:36.176
a slapped-together
quinceañera.

12:36.176 --> 12:37.467
We have five days.

12:37.467 --> 12:40.050
And now, an exclusive
interview

12:40.050 --> 12:42.472
with the one and only
Hurricane Lewie.

12:42.472 --> 12:45.305
Hi, Ron.
Thanks for having me.

12:45.305 --> 12:47.307
It has been
a hectic few days.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.229
Smashing trees,
flooding basements,

12:49.229 --> 12:51.231
ripping off roofs!

12:51.231 --> 12:52.392
I am winded.

12:54.154 --> 12:57.067
Any truth to the rumors
that you're being downgraded

12:57.067 --> 12:58.488
to a tropical storm?

12:58.488 --> 13:01.031
Uncool, Ron. Uncool.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.993
Can a tropical storm
do this?

13:07.077 --> 13:09.329
Hey, that is potentially
a family heirloom.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.041
There you have it.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.413
This is Ron Storm
with Diaz Action News.

13:13.413 --> 13:16.466
Mom, Dad, back to you.

13:19.259 --> 13:21.181
You pick that up,
Ron Storm.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.347
( pounding sound )

13:32.232 --> 13:34.354
Rachel. Rachel,
wake up.

13:37.197 --> 13:40.440
There had better be a fire
or a midnight sample sale.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.154
- Georgie.
- Yep.

13:44.154 --> 13:46.206
We better go outside
and see what's going on.

13:49.209 --> 13:53.123
I've got to find
a quieter neighborhood.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:02.222 --> 14:05.095
She only shoots night hoops
when she's upset.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.057
That's convenient.
She can't see the ones
she's missing.

14:07.057 --> 14:09.309
Bad matchup.

14:09.309 --> 14:11.471
I need something
with less arms.

14:11.471 --> 14:14.104
Or none.
Sea horse?

14:15.105 --> 14:16.436
You're in.

14:19.569 --> 14:21.151
Hey.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.535
Guys?

14:25.535 --> 14:28.158
Georgie, we're out here
'cause we're concerned
about you.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.200
You're concerned
about me?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.412
I'm not the one who
looks like an underwater
jug band.

14:32.412 --> 14:34.294
We know something's
bothering you.

14:34.294 --> 14:36.336
What is it?

14:36.336 --> 14:38.168
My quinceañera.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.300
Turns out being in
the spotlight's terrible.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.422
I... I don't like my dress,

14:42.422 --> 14:44.594
I can't do my dance,
and most of the people coming

14:44.594 --> 14:46.506
are very short girls
I do not know.

14:46.506 --> 14:49.429
So what are you saying?
You wanna go back
to eating omelets?

14:49.429 --> 14:52.182
I'm saying I don't want
a quinceañera at all.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.514
Georgie, come back.

14:54.514 --> 14:57.607
This is on us.
I feel terrible.

14:57.607 --> 15:00.360
And I know
everyone else does, too.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.113
Hey, guys.

15:03.113 --> 15:04.574
Since we're all out here,

15:04.574 --> 15:06.526
anyone wanna push me
on the swing?

15:12.532 --> 15:16.296
I can't believe Georgie
cancelled her party
because of us.

15:16.296 --> 15:19.249
I'm having this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.591
That's called guilt.

15:21.591 --> 15:23.543
Yeah? Well,
it's a real bummer.

15:23.543 --> 15:25.425
I got all of this started

15:25.425 --> 15:27.547
by super-sizing
Georgie's quinceañera

15:27.547 --> 15:29.139
so I could show off
my Harley Cam.

15:29.139 --> 15:31.221
I pulled up
the jerk wagon,

15:31.221 --> 15:34.264
you guys piled in,
and we ran over Georgie.

15:34.264 --> 15:36.396
How could we have
been so selfish?

15:36.396 --> 15:39.149
We do have lots of practice.

15:41.401 --> 15:44.404
Nature calls.
That's hurricane humor.

15:44.404 --> 15:47.277
You're a hurricane.
Take it outside.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.329
Beast, grab your slicker.

15:49.329 --> 15:51.281
You're about to do
a special report.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.246
Okay, guys, we've gotta
stop thinking about ourselves

15:56.246 --> 15:57.497
and start thinking
about...

15:57.497 --> 16:00.340
"Georgie, we know
 we messed up.

16:00.340 --> 16:03.213
So we're making you
 team captain.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.255
Whatever you want for
 your quince,

16:05.255 --> 16:08.468
you draw up the plays,
 we'll run them."

16:55.265 --> 16:56.686
This looks amazing.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.558
I hope Georgie likes it.

16:58.558 --> 17:00.480
GEORGIE: I love it.

17:07.357 --> 17:09.358
You look so beautiful.

17:09.358 --> 17:11.611
I kinda do.

17:11.611 --> 17:13.613
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

17:13.613 --> 17:16.496
but you look like
my sister.

17:17.656 --> 17:20.750
You are growing up
so fast.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.662
Hey, go stand by
the scuba guy.

17:22.662 --> 17:24.334
We're gonna want
to remember this.

17:31.381 --> 17:35.345
This just in.
Hurricane Lewie is
headed for Marshport.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.677
Yeah, we know.
He's been here all day.

17:37.677 --> 17:40.390
Not me.
The actual hurricane.

17:40.390 --> 17:43.443
Boys, the news always says
there's gonna be a hurricane
in Marshport.

17:43.443 --> 17:46.356
I've boarded up the store
ten times for nothing.

17:48.528 --> 17:50.530
Okay, we're good.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.533
BEAST: Dad, I'm
still in here!

17:54.784 --> 17:57.657
- Or...
- Don't even
think about it.
- I wasn't.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.462
Trust me. We're good.

18:02.462 --> 18:06.466
( wind howling )

18:06.466 --> 18:07.757
Georgie!

18:07.757 --> 18:10.590
Oh, no!

18:10.590 --> 18:13.383
- Georgie, honey.
- Georgie!

18:13.383 --> 18:15.595
- Sweetheart.
- The sea horse got her.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.685
So the good news is,
you sprained your ankle,

18:25.685 --> 18:27.607
they've closed the roads.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.609
None of the guests can come,
and we lost electricity.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.402
Where's the good news?

18:32.402 --> 18:35.405
I'm sorry. I just started
talking and hoped I'd
find something along the way.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.409
Here's something
to ice your ankle.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.411
And one less bag of
vegetable medley we have to eat.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.413
That's good news.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.665
Actually, I'm gonna put that
right back in the freezer.

18:45.665 --> 18:47.547
Oh.

18:47.547 --> 18:49.749
You ruined your
sister's big night.

18:49.749 --> 18:51.591
How do you feel?

18:51.591 --> 18:53.423
Conflicted, Ron.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.426
Sure, it hurts,
but my job is to cause

18:56.426 --> 18:58.518
as much destruction
as possible.

18:58.518 --> 18:59.759
You wanna play
pitty-pat,

18:59.759 --> 19:02.392
talk to
a low pressure system.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.564
Words from the hurricane.

19:04.564 --> 19:07.567
Regretful but proud.

19:07.567 --> 19:10.530
This has been Ron Storm,
wishing you good night

19:10.530 --> 19:12.402
and good weather.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.733
This just in.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.825
Area man about to
rescue his property

19:15.825 --> 19:17.617
before it washes
down the driveway.

19:17.617 --> 19:19.449
Will he return?
Stay tuned.

19:24.624 --> 19:27.497
Who hired him?

19:27.497 --> 19:29.499
Not me.

19:29.499 --> 19:30.880
( thunder crashes )

19:30.880 --> 19:33.713
I'm so sorry
this happened.

19:33.713 --> 19:35.465
It's okay.
It's a sign.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.507
It's the universe's way
of telling me

19:37.507 --> 19:39.429
that I shouldn't be
the center of attention.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.601
I'm not the kind of person
to go out there

19:41.601 --> 19:43.723
and do a big dance.

19:43.723 --> 19:45.805
I wanted to be,
but I'm not.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.517
That is not true.

19:47.517 --> 19:48.898
( thunder crashes )

19:48.898 --> 19:52.812
I may not be able
to control the weather... yet,

19:52.812 --> 19:54.694
but I'm not going
to let the weather control me.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.816
It's time to show my sister,
Mother Nature,

19:56.816 --> 19:59.659
and the universe
there's no stopping a Diaz.

19:59.659 --> 20:01.491
( thunder crashes )

20:01.491 --> 20:02.822
That's right,
I said it.

20:02.822 --> 20:04.664
So we all got to work.

20:04.664 --> 20:07.497
It wasn't going to be
 the party we'd planned,

20:07.497 --> 20:08.878
but we still had
 everything we needed

20:08.878 --> 20:12.832
to make it great...
 us.

20:12.832 --> 20:14.754
Wow! This must be
what it feels like

20:14.754 --> 20:16.596
to win a game seven.

20:16.596 --> 20:18.598
You do deserve
your moment in the sun...

20:18.598 --> 20:20.680
even if it's raining.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.682
And I have
something for you.

20:22.682 --> 20:24.554
LEWIE: Whoa!

20:24.554 --> 20:26.846
It's motorized.
All you have to do
is stand on it.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.768
Now you can still
do your dance.

20:28.768 --> 20:30.850
- BEAST: Can I try it?
- TOM: That's fantastic.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.443
- SUZY: Harley,
that's so nice.
- RACHEL: Awesome!

20:35.695 --> 20:37.447
SUZY: Aw, Georgie.

20:38.948 --> 20:42.532
This is amazing.
I love my Harley board.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.865
Actually, I call it
the Georgie board.

20:57.797 --> 20:59.879
Normally, we start with
a father-daughter dance.

20:59.879 --> 21:02.682
But I don't know how long
that ankle's gonna hold out,

21:02.682 --> 21:05.725
so let's get to the part
where everyone's involved.

21:05.725 --> 21:08.888
Now for the moment
we've all been waiting for.

21:08.888 --> 21:10.980
The family dance.

21:10.980 --> 21:14.774
( music plays )

21:34.834 --> 21:40.680
♪ ♪

22:03.943 --> 22:05.785
So the Harley Cam
 will have to wait

22:05.785 --> 22:07.907
a little longer
 to have its big moment.

22:07.907 --> 22:10.870
The important thing is,
 Georgie got to have hers.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.630
Guys. Guys!

22:24.554 --> 22:25.805
( crashing )

22:25.805 --> 22:28.678
