WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:07.475
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.577
It's, like, 4:32

00:09.577 --> 00:13.047
in the morning.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.015
And I can't sleep.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.486
God, I look in the monitor,

00:18.486 --> 00:20.054
I look like crap.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.122
I, anyway...

00:21.122 --> 00:23.357
I-I feel bad that these--

00:23.357 --> 00:24.225
especially young people--

00:24.225 --> 00:27.628
are going through such a

00:27.628 --> 00:29.297
difficult time in their life.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.431
We don't want people dying over

00:30.431 --> 00:32.100
this.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.101
We don't want people murdered

00:33.101 --> 00:34.468
over this stuff.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.804
God, what a responsibility I

00:36.804 --> 00:38.572
have... towards this community.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.840
Am I going to do everything

00:39.840 --> 00:41.242
right?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.710
Am I gonna say the right things?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.578
Do I project the right image?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.080
My mind's just spinning with

00:46.080 --> 00:48.149
thoughts.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.551
I just hope I get it right.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.654
I hope I get it right.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.623
Yeah.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.498
>> CAITLYN: Vanity Fair is out!

01:04.498 --> 01:07.735
(people cheering, applauding)

01:07.735 --> 01:10.604
Look at that cover, baby!

01:10.604 --> 01:11.872
>> REPORTER: We begin with the

01:11.872 --> 01:13.040
world's introduction to

01:13.040 --> 01:14.041
Caitlyn Jenner.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.042
>> COURTNEY: Yeah! (whoops)

01:15.042 --> 01:16.043
>> CAITLYN: Shh, shh!

01:16.043 --> 01:16.877
>> REPORTER: Former Olympian

01:16.877 --> 01:17.978
Bruce Jenner confirmed her

01:17.978 --> 01:19.347
transition to a woman on the

01:19.347 --> 01:21.149
cover of Vanity Fair.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.151
Jenner first talked about her

01:23.151 --> 01:24.352
transition in an interview with

01:24.352 --> 01:25.853
Diane Sawyer, saying we can

01:25.853 --> 01:27.588
meet her soon.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.590
>> CAITLYN: I don't think I have

01:29.590 --> 01:33.161
ever been more excited about

01:33.161 --> 01:36.197
life than I am right now.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.766
Living my true identity.

01:38.766 --> 01:42.270
Um, and hopefully, going to make

01:42.270 --> 01:44.172
a difference in the world.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.639
That's my mission.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.640
>> REPORTER: Khloe Kardashian

01:46.640 --> 01:47.808
tweeted this morning: "We were

01:47.808 --> 01:49.410
given this life because you

01:49.410 --> 01:50.911
were strong enough to live it.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.413
I couldn't be prouder.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.382
Caitlyn, you are beautiful."

01:57.885 --> 01:58.919
>> ROB: Your cover looks

01:58.919 --> 01:59.920
amazing.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.522
>> CAITLYN: Isn't that rockin'?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.523
>> ROB: So good, yeah, you look

02:02.523 --> 02:03.724
amazing and everything.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.758
>> CAITLYN: It's so good to hear

02:04.758 --> 02:05.893
from you.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.195
Kim?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.196
>> KIM: You didn't tell me you

02:08.196 --> 02:09.297
were on Twitter.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.531
>> CAITLYN: I've been on Twitter

02:10.531 --> 02:11.799
for an hour.

02:11.799 --> 02:12.933
>> KIM: Well, the head of

02:12.933 --> 02:15.203
Twitter just said, "We think

02:15.203 --> 02:18.239
Caitlyn could break President

02:18.239 --> 02:20.874
Obama's gained follower record

02:20.874 --> 02:22.910
one million within the first

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
five hours."

02:24.212 --> 02:25.446
>> CAITLYN: Well, let's go.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.315
Okay! Let's go for the record!

02:27.315 --> 02:29.217
I love records!

02:29.217 --> 02:30.518
At this point, what's the total

02:30.518 --> 02:31.952
amount?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.787
>> KIM: 720,000.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.523
>> CAITLYN: No!

02:35.523 --> 02:36.790
>> RONDA: In two hours.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.925
>> CAITLYN: In two hours.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.693
We're going for the record.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.728
>> KIM: Just wanted you to know

02:40.728 --> 02:42.230
I'm on the bandwagon.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.497
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

02:43.497 --> 02:45.699
Thank you for all the support.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.235
>> KIM: Of course, of course.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.469
>> CAITLYN: All right.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.238
>> KIM: All eyes on you now.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.639
You cannot disappoint.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.906
>> CAITLYN: I know.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.243
No, it's got to be good.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.977
The tremendous amount of support

02:56.977 --> 02:58.912
that I've gotten has been

02:58.912 --> 03:00.848
overwhelming.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.783
But you also have to realize

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
that, uh, it's not this way for

03:04.585 --> 03:06.454
everybody.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.757
There are so many people that

03:09.757 --> 03:13.594
have struggled with family;

03:13.594 --> 03:16.530
who struggle with friends;

03:16.530 --> 03:18.532
who struggle with ridicule;

03:18.532 --> 03:19.933
who are not having financial

03:19.933 --> 03:21.669
resources.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.272
The suicide rate nine times

03:24.272 --> 03:27.275
higher in the trans community

03:27.275 --> 03:28.976
than in the general public.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.744
Murder rate's higher.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.280
This is a really important

03:32.280 --> 03:33.414
issue.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.415
People are dying over this

03:34.415 --> 03:36.650
issue.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.419
I feel a tremendous

03:38.419 --> 03:40.288
responsibility here.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.356
Because I have a voice and

03:42.356 --> 03:45.626
there's so many trans people out

03:45.626 --> 03:48.796
there who do not have a voice.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.964
I can't speak for them, because

03:50.964 --> 03:52.733
everybody has their own

03:52.733 --> 03:54.568
experience, but I am an expert

03:54.568 --> 03:58.306
on my story.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.740
>> WOMAN: Cheers to Caitlyn.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.442
>> CAITLYN: Out two weeks, yeah!

04:01.442 --> 04:03.344
There's so much to learn, so

04:03.344 --> 04:05.379
many people to meet.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.847
>> WOMAN: Your transformation

04:06.847 --> 04:07.981
has helped me to understand my

04:07.981 --> 04:09.617
father.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.951
>> CAITLYN: I've lived a great

04:10.951 --> 04:12.320
life.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.987
And I realize, in this

04:13.987 --> 04:15.423
transition, that I have that

04:15.423 --> 04:16.757
privileged status.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.025
(crowd clamoring)

04:18.025 --> 04:19.393
But I hope that I'm in a

04:19.393 --> 04:21.329
position to turn around...

04:21.329 --> 04:22.763
Yay!

04:22.763 --> 04:23.997
...and help this community.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.466
Hi, everybody.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.500
I want to spotlight those

04:26.500 --> 04:27.901
organizations that are out there

04:27.901 --> 04:29.603
doing some really good things.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.904
>> BOY: Being around friends is

04:30.904 --> 04:32.440
really nice when you haven't

04:32.440 --> 04:34.074
been around friends for most of

04:34.074 --> 04:35.609
your life.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.610
>> CAITLYN: Well, you got

04:36.610 --> 04:37.878
friends here.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.380
But also I have to figure out my

04:39.380 --> 04:40.848
own journey.

04:40.848 --> 04:41.882
Now I know why girls need a

04:41.882 --> 04:43.083
sports bra.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.652
There's a lot of firsts out

04:44.652 --> 04:46.019
there for me.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.020
My entire family have not met

04:47.020 --> 04:48.021
Caitlyn.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.022
>> KIM: Hi.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.023
>> CAITLYN: Hi, babe.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.625
I want to be able to make

04:51.625 --> 04:53.093
friends in the trans community.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.362
>> WOMAN: Everybody on Jenner.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.696
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.164
And I have to figure out how I'm

04:57.164 --> 04:58.566
going to live the rest of my

04:58.566 --> 04:59.600
life.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.001
>> KYLIE: I love you.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.836
>> CAITLYN (crying): I want them

05:02.836 --> 05:05.373
to be proud of their daddy.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.209
>> ANNOUNCER: Bruce Jenner has a

05:09.209 --> 05:10.511
commanding lead in the home

05:10.511 --> 05:12.913
stretch.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.214
Bruce Jenner has the world

05:14.214 --> 05:16.183
record in the decathlon.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.106
>> CAITLYN: My mother's coming

05:39.106 --> 05:40.741
today.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.275
Um...

05:42.275 --> 05:44.512
I don't know what it is.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.846
I was able to tell everybody in

05:45.846 --> 05:47.615
my family first, before I ever

05:47.615 --> 05:49.617
got to my mom.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.719
It's so important, during this

05:51.719 --> 05:53.987
transition, that you surround

05:53.987 --> 05:57.491
yourself with positive people.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.626
How you doing in there, Ronda?

05:58.626 --> 05:59.627
>> RONDA: Good, I got three

05:59.627 --> 06:00.694
outfits for you.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
>> CAITLYN: All right.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.696
>> RONDA: That you can pick

06:02.696 --> 06:03.931
from.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.332
>> CAITLYN: Years ago,

06:05.332 --> 06:07.067
I confided in Ronda.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.036
And she really has been a friend

06:09.036 --> 06:11.605
that has supported me.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.674
Combined with Courtney, I've

06:13.674 --> 06:15.275
really got a great support

06:15.275 --> 06:16.309
group.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.310
It-it, from that standpoint,

06:17.310 --> 06:18.746
it's... I'm-I'm blessed.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.947
>> RONDA: They just landed.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.582
So do you want me to start

06:21.582 --> 06:22.650
looking in the closet for

06:22.650 --> 06:23.784
things that you can wear?

06:23.784 --> 06:25.453
>> CAITLYN: Uh, I don't know.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.254
I don't think I can be too...

06:27.254 --> 06:29.957
you know, in "le femme" mode.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.091
It's got to be kind of, yeah,

06:31.091 --> 06:32.259
right.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.561
>> RONDA: No dressy dress.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.495
>> CAITLYN: No, I-I already told

06:34.495 --> 06:35.663
them: you're coming down to

06:35.663 --> 06:36.464
meet Caitlyn.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.465
>> COURTNEY: I've never seen you

06:37.465 --> 06:38.732
actually nervous.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.733
>> CAITLYN: Well, it's my

06:39.733 --> 06:41.469
mother... God.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.244
>> PAM: Mom hasn't had her

06:51.244 --> 06:52.880
children together since her

06:52.880 --> 06:54.482
birthday party, four years ago.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.949
>> ESTHER: That's right.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.184
>> PAM: So this is, this is very

06:57.184 --> 06:58.652
special.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.753
>> ESTHER: And I think...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.121
>> PAM: In many ways.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.490
(Esther laughs)

07:02.490 --> 07:04.057
>> CAITLYN: Sleeves up or down?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.058
Let's see.

07:05.058 --> 07:05.859
>> RONDA: Slightly up.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.827
>> CAITLYN: What about

07:06.827 --> 07:07.695
a necklace?

07:07.695 --> 07:08.696
>> COURTNEY: Do you... I mean,

07:08.696 --> 07:09.863
should we button it one more up

07:09.863 --> 07:10.864
just 'cause it's Mom?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.099
>> RONDA: Yeah, it's Mom.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.368
>> LISA: When everything first

07:15.368 --> 07:18.038
broke, it was difficult because

07:18.038 --> 07:21.041
I had known my brother as,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.243
you know, Bruce, this amazing

07:23.243 --> 07:25.713
athlete, for, you know, all of

07:25.713 --> 07:27.748
my life... and, I guess the

07:27.748 --> 07:30.518
whole family has to change

07:30.518 --> 07:31.819
along with... with her.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.153
>> ESTHER: When you're in the

07:33.153 --> 07:34.955
grocery store, to see these

07:34.955 --> 07:36.890
tabloid magazines and all the

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
things that they come out with,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.828
with... you know...

07:40.828 --> 07:42.029
>> PRODUCER: So, what was your

07:42.029 --> 07:44.698
reaction when you found out?

07:44.698 --> 07:47.367
>> ESTHER: I think I was silent.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.069
>> PAM: He confided in me over

07:49.069 --> 07:51.071
30 years ago.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.439
>> ESTHER: You thought maybe he

07:52.439 --> 07:54.542
was... uh, getting over it?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.209
>> PAM: Because the subject

07:56.209 --> 07:57.110
never came up again.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.378
>> ESTHER: Yeah.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.113
>> PAM: I thought it was

08:00.113 --> 08:02.149
something that maybe counseling

08:02.149 --> 08:03.050
would help him with.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.585
Then, about two years ago,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.319
he started talking to me about

08:06.319 --> 08:08.556
wanting to live an authentic

08:08.556 --> 08:10.457
life.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.359
>> CAITLYN: Now, here's

08:12.359 --> 08:13.360
the question.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.361
>> RONDA: What?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.596
>> CAITLYN: I'm signing the

08:15.596 --> 08:17.264
birthday card for Mother...

08:17.264 --> 08:18.398
>> RONDA: I bought you two!

08:18.398 --> 08:19.399
>> CAITLYN: How do I sign it?

08:19.399 --> 08:20.400
>> COURTNEY: In case you mess

08:20.400 --> 08:21.401
up.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.570
>> RONDA: You got two. (laughs)

08:22.570 --> 08:23.604
>> COURTNEY: You're Caitlyn.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.005
This is the life you're living.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.707
>> RONDA: Yeah.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.242
>> CAITLYN (sing-songy): Scary.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.178
>> PAM: He-he felt like he

08:31.178 --> 08:33.280
needed to follow through on his

08:33.280 --> 08:35.448
desires and to go, actually,

08:35.448 --> 08:38.586
public, um, and discuss the

08:38.586 --> 08:40.721
issue.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.356
I initially discouraged him.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.858
I... I didn't understand how

08:44.858 --> 08:45.993
that could work.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.961
(Esther sighs)

08:53.767 --> 08:55.302
>> CAITLYN: It's kind of tough

08:55.302 --> 08:56.336
to tell your mother all these

08:56.336 --> 08:57.938
secrets.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.472
You always have doubts in your

08:59.472 --> 09:01.208
mind of how that first

09:01.208 --> 09:02.676
impression is going to work out.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.678
You want it to be so good.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.680
She's never met Caitlyn.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.681
And I'm just hoping for the

09:07.681 --> 09:09.650
best.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.829
Oh, God, here we go.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.873
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God, here we go.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
>> PRODUCER: So come on in.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.912
>> ESTHER: Okay.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.913
>> PRODUCER: Welcome.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.915
>> ESTHER: There you are.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.652
>> CAITLYN: Now, everybody.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.654
It's okay, it's...

09:46.654 --> 09:47.921
Hello, Mom.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.657
>> ESTHER: I knew it would be.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.926
It's okay, it's okay.

09:52.926 --> 09:53.927
Sister Lisa, hold on.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.928
>> LISA: Hello.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.663
>> CAITLYN: I know, I'm taller

09:55.663 --> 09:56.664
than you.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.665
>> LISA: Yes, you are, and

09:57.665 --> 09:58.265
you've always been.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.266
>> CAITLYN: It's sister Pam.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.600
Hey...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.936
Hey...

10:02.936 --> 10:03.837
We're all here.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.838
>> PAM: You're gorgeous.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.105
Gorgeous!

10:05.105 --> 10:05.939
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
Thank you.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.942
>> PAM: I was quite

10:08.942 --> 10:09.943
apprehensive.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.279
I knew she would be d...

10:12.279 --> 10:13.613
different looking.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.949
Uh, and I was hoping that she

10:15.949 --> 10:18.285
would have the same personality,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.620
uh, as Bruce.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.622
And she does.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
And she's so relaxed and

10:24.624 --> 10:26.293
so happy.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.295
That makes me very happy.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.296
I thought you were gonna look

10:29.296 --> 10:30.964
more like me.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.300
(everyone laughs)

10:33.300 --> 10:34.634
>> CAITLYN: Little sister,

10:34.634 --> 10:35.969
after, what has it been, 35

10:35.969 --> 10:37.304
years we've talked about this?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.305
>> PAM: Yes, about that long.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.306
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah, I know.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.307
>> PAM: About that long.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.308
>> CAITLYN: Back that long.

10:41.308 --> 10:41.975
I know.

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
>> ESTHER: And you never talked

10:42.976 --> 10:43.643
to me.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
>> CAITLYN: I know. I know.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.645
Well, we could sit down and talk

10:45.645 --> 10:47.981
about that.

10:47.981 --> 10:48.982
>> ESTHER: I never knew.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
I never guessed you were having

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
a problem.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.585
>> CAITLYN: I know.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.921
>> ESTHER: You hid it very well.

10:53.921 --> 10:54.922
>> CAITLYN: I did.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.923
I was a professional at hiding

10:55.923 --> 10:56.924
it.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.591
>> PAM: I guess so.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.728
>> ESTHER: It is overwhelming.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.729
I guess I've been preparing

11:01.729 --> 11:03.731
myself.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.998
Uh...

11:04.998 --> 11:08.001
I knew he was going to be...

11:08.001 --> 11:10.738
dressed...

11:10.738 --> 11:13.340
as a woman.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.742
Uh...

11:14.742 --> 11:16.343
I think he's a very good-looking

11:16.343 --> 11:19.747
woman.

11:19.747 --> 11:23.016
Uh... he's still Bruce.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.017
(crying): Oh, I don't want to do

11:24.017 --> 11:25.018
that.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.019
>> PRODUCER: No, no, no, it's

11:26.019 --> 11:28.021
okay, it's okay.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.357
>> ESTHER: I-I love him so much.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.761
I always have, I always will.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.763
>> PRODUCER: And... yes.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.031
>> ESTHER: And yes.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.768
It's-it's...

11:40.768 --> 11:42.035
a lot to get used to.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.036
>> PRODUCER: Mm-hmm.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.037
Of course.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.038
It's a surprise.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.039
>> ESTHER: But I will.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.040
>> PRODUCER: Yes.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.009
>> ESTHER: I will.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.849
>> PAM: I was asking Bruce how

11:55.849 --> 11:57.851
did he come up with the name

11:57.851 --> 11:58.852
Caitlyn.

11:58.852 --> 11:59.853
>> CAITLYN: I kind of narrowed

11:59.853 --> 12:01.922
it down to a few of them,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.256
Caitlyn being one of them.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.258
And I actually was with Ronda.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.927
When I was talking to her about

12:06.927 --> 12:07.928
this whole thing about two years

12:07.928 --> 12:08.929
ago, she goes, "Well, you know,

12:08.929 --> 12:09.930
I always liked the name

12:09.930 --> 12:10.931
Caitlyn."

12:10.931 --> 12:12.265
And I went-- at some point, you

12:12.265 --> 12:13.600
just have to kind of bite the

12:13.600 --> 12:16.269
bullet... and say, "Okay, boom.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.604
It's done."

12:17.604 --> 12:19.272
But talking to other trans

12:19.272 --> 12:22.275
people, they said a good way to

12:22.275 --> 12:26.613
get your female name... is to...

12:26.613 --> 12:28.949
ask your mother.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.617
I'm sure when you didn't know

12:30.617 --> 12:32.285
there was a boy or a girl...

12:32.285 --> 12:33.286
>> ESTHER: Mm-hmm.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.621
>> CAITLYN: ...you had names for

12:34.621 --> 12:35.622
a boy name, and you had a girl

12:35.622 --> 12:36.289
name.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.290
I don't know if you remember.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.291
>> PAM: Do you remember?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.292
>> ESTHER: I don't remember.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.293
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.294
>> ESTHER: And I'm sure I did

12:41.294 --> 12:42.295
have two different names

12:42.295 --> 12:42.963
picked.

12:42.963 --> 12:43.964
(cell phone rings)

12:43.964 --> 12:44.965
>> PAM: Did you have a boy's

12:44.965 --> 12:45.966
name picked out for me?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.968
>> CAITLYN: Hi, baby.

12:47.968 --> 12:48.969
>> KYLIE: Hey, Daddy.

12:48.969 --> 12:49.970
>> CAITLYN: Am I on FaceTime

12:49.970 --> 12:50.971
with you?

12:50.971 --> 12:53.573
Kylie has not met Caitlyn yet.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.243
And she FaceTimes me.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.244
And there I am.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.245
I didn't know it was coming on.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.913
Um, don't want to scare you.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.981
You just woke up?

13:00.981 --> 13:01.982
Where are you?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.316
>> KYLIE: The dentist.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.651
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you just woke up

13:04.651 --> 13:06.319
at the dentist.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.988
Are you feeling okay?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.657
>> KYLIE: I'm a little loopy.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.659
>> CAITLYN: A little loopy?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.662
I've never... had my first

13:15.662 --> 13:16.997
experience with somebody on

13:16.997 --> 13:17.998
FaceTime.

13:17.998 --> 13:18.999
To be honest with you, I didn't

13:18.999 --> 13:20.000
know what to do.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.334
Like, do I turn it away?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.335
Or, you know...

13:22.335 --> 13:23.670
I-I... uh... I don't know...

13:23.670 --> 13:24.237
I was kind of shocked, when I

13:24.671 --> 13:26.339
thought... "Oh well."

13:26.339 --> 13:28.008
* Ta-da.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.009
(everyone laughs)

13:29.009 --> 13:30.010
>> KYLIE: You look pretty.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.011
>> CAITLYN: I don't want to

13:31.011 --> 13:32.012
scare you.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.013
Okay.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.014
>> KYLIE: You're not scaring me.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.015
You look pretty.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.349
>> CAITLYN: Okay, good.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.684
I love you.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.019
>> KYLIE: Bye, Daddy.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.155
>> CAITLYN: Mwah!

13:42.155 --> 13:45.025
Yeah.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.693
There's an expert in town named

13:46.693 --> 13:47.694
Susan Landon.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.029
She's coming up... uh... to

13:49.029 --> 13:50.363
answer any questions that you

13:50.363 --> 13:51.364
might have.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.299
Uh, she's great.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.633
>> ESTHER: I need to learn more.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.634
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, okay, we'll

13:54.634 --> 13:55.635
have a great conversation.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.637
>> ESTHER: Good.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.638
>> CAITLYN: Susan, baby, how you

13:58.638 --> 13:59.639
doing? Hello.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.640
>> SUSAN: Hi, darling, how are

14:00.640 --> 14:01.708
you?

14:01.708 --> 14:02.709
>> CAITLYN: I am great.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.710
>> SUSAN: Good.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.711
>> CAITLYN: So good to see you.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.378
>> SUSAN: You too.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.379
>> CAITLYN: Thanks for coming

14:06.379 --> 14:07.047
out.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.048
>> SUSAN: Thank you for asking

14:08.048 --> 14:08.715
me.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.716
>> CAITLYN: I know. Susan works

14:09.716 --> 14:10.717
with families.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.386
Uh, Mom has said, on numerous

14:13.386 --> 14:14.721
occasions, "I need to know

14:14.721 --> 14:15.722
more."

14:15.722 --> 14:16.723
>> SUSAN: Well, you can ask me

14:16.723 --> 14:17.724
whatever you want.

14:17.724 --> 14:18.458
>> CAITLYN: Let's take...

14:18.458 --> 14:19.292
Let's go in here and sit down,

14:19.292 --> 14:20.327
so we can relax and...

14:20.327 --> 14:21.728
>> SUSAN and ESTHER: Okay.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.729
>> SUSAN: There's nothing more

14:22.729 --> 14:24.397
important than acceptance,

14:24.397 --> 14:26.066
support.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.067
This takes time in some

14:27.067 --> 14:28.401
families.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.402
But the other thing to remember

14:29.402 --> 14:30.737
is that it's a process over

14:30.737 --> 14:31.738
time.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.406
>> ESTHER: I hate to brag, but I

14:33.406 --> 14:35.742
have some beautiful children.

14:35.742 --> 14:36.743
Where's Pam?

14:36.743 --> 14:37.744
There she is.

14:37.744 --> 14:38.745
>> CAITLYN: Some getting

14:38.745 --> 14:39.746
prettier.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.747
>> ESTHER: Yes, I-I know.

14:40.747 --> 14:41.748
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.749
I know.

14:42.749 --> 14:43.750
Yeah, some getting... a little

14:43.750 --> 14:44.751
prettier.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.086
All right, just stay on point.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.754
Since we have Susan here, the

14:47.754 --> 14:49.422
big question is: have you ever

14:49.422 --> 14:52.425
seen anybody... like, get over

14:52.425 --> 14:55.428
it and get cured of this?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.764
>> SUSAN: Uh, me personally, no,

14:57.764 --> 14:58.765
I have not.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.766
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know.

14:59.766 --> 15:00.400
It's just kind of the way you're

15:00.400 --> 15:01.268
born.

15:01.268 --> 15:01.834
>> SUSAN: Yeah.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.835
>> ESTHER: You know how little

15:02.835 --> 15:03.836
boys outgrow their clothes?

15:03.836 --> 15:04.837
>> SUSAN: Yes.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.173
>> ESTHER: I took you to a

15:06.173 --> 15:09.176
store, and you did not want

15:09.176 --> 15:10.177
those clothes on you.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.511
(Caitlyn laughs)

15:11.511 --> 15:13.513
You were trying to pull them off

15:13.513 --> 15:14.514
of you.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.515
And I was trying to get them on

15:15.515 --> 15:16.516
you.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.517
And you didn't want them.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.186
And I thought, "He just doesn't

15:19.186 --> 15:20.853
want new clothes."

15:20.853 --> 15:22.822
Would that have been in his

15:22.822 --> 15:25.993
person, then, that he would

15:25.993 --> 15:27.027
rather have had a dress?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.361
>> SUSAN: Oh, absolutely.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.662
Let's say for a minute that

15:29.662 --> 15:30.797
that's what he would have

15:30.797 --> 15:31.398
preferred to wear-- sorry.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.399
She.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.400
>> CAITLYN: It's quite

15:33.400 --> 15:34.401
all right.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.102
>> SUSAN: I meant "he" then.

15:35.102 --> 15:35.835
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

15:35.835 --> 15:36.703
>> SUSAN: ...she would have

15:36.703 --> 15:38.138
preferred to wear.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.572
'Cause pronouns are really

15:39.572 --> 15:42.009
important, everybody.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.344
So if that, at that point, is

15:44.344 --> 15:47.014
what she had wanted to have, she

15:47.014 --> 15:48.515
probably wasn't able to pick it,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.250
okay?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.584
And then, when children get

15:51.584 --> 15:54.021
older, they notice the reactions

15:54.021 --> 15:54.621
of other people.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.322
>> ESTHER: But they, the...

15:55.322 --> 15:56.589
>> SUSAN: They start taking in

15:56.589 --> 15:57.857
information-- like, "This

15:57.857 --> 16:00.127
probably isn't gonna be okay,

16:00.127 --> 16:02.029
so I better fit in."

16:02.029 --> 16:03.030
>> ESTHER: Yeah.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.831
>> SUSAN: And if anybody tried

16:04.831 --> 16:06.633
to fit in more than you, I don't

16:06.633 --> 16:07.634
know who it was.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.635
>> CAITLYN: I did a good job,

16:08.635 --> 16:09.136
yeah.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.137
(laughter)

16:10.137 --> 16:12.372
>> ESTHER: But the child has no

16:12.372 --> 16:16.509
idea why their reaction is

16:16.509 --> 16:17.510
that way.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.511
For instance, the clothes.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.546
>> SUSAN: But by the time

16:19.546 --> 16:21.148
they're about five, they start

16:21.148 --> 16:22.449
figuring it out.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.716
>> ESTHER: Now, I'm sure you've

16:23.716 --> 16:25.318
read the passage in the Bible

16:25.318 --> 16:27.654
about if you dress... if you're

16:27.654 --> 16:28.655
a man and you dress like a

16:28.655 --> 16:30.757
woman, you know...

16:30.757 --> 16:33.326
>> SUSAN: Yeah.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.062
>> ESTHER: Do you have any, uh,

16:35.062 --> 16:36.763
interpretation of that?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.565
>> SUSAN: Um... I'm not a

16:38.565 --> 16:40.433
biblical scholar, so I don't

16:40.433 --> 16:41.934
know exactly what that verse

16:41.934 --> 16:43.470
represented to people at the

16:43.470 --> 16:46.173
time, obviously, but for me,

16:46.173 --> 16:49.242
personally, Caitlyn is a woman,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.211
and really always has been.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.823
>> PAM: Be gentle, please.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.791
>> CAITLYN: What?

17:04.791 --> 17:05.758
>> PAM: I said, be gentle.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.959
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, I'm

17:06.959 --> 17:07.360
gonna be gentle.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.261
You know I've always been gentle

17:08.261 --> 17:09.262
with you.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.597
This one's a little...

17:10.597 --> 17:11.598
higher strike.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.599
You don't care.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.666
(Pam laughs)

17:13.666 --> 17:14.667
Let's do it.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.202
>> PAM: Okay.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.203
>> CAITLYN: What do you do with

17:16.203 --> 17:17.270
the balls?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.971
Guys, we got pockets.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.173
(Pam laughs)

17:20.173 --> 17:23.843
Ready?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.445
Whoa. Bad start.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.446
>> PAM: One point.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.447
>> CAITLYN: Take it easy on me,

17:27.447 --> 17:28.115
Sis.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.749
Here it comes.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.118
>> PAM: Ooh!

17:31.118 --> 17:32.252
(Pam laughs)

17:32.252 --> 17:33.353
>> CAITLYN: God, come on.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.655
It's great... to be able to base

17:35.655 --> 17:38.325
a relationship with your family

17:38.325 --> 17:39.492
on honesty.

17:39.492 --> 17:44.131
I mean, I am... so happy, uh,

17:44.131 --> 17:46.799
the way this whole process has

17:46.799 --> 17:47.967
begun.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.369
>> PAM: I know we talked about

17:49.369 --> 17:50.637
you and your straight guy

17:50.637 --> 17:52.605
friends-- you haven't really met

17:52.605 --> 17:53.740
yet.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.741
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, I've come

17:54.741 --> 17:55.742
out to all the girls, you're

17:55.742 --> 17:56.743
right.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.510
>> PAM: And everybody's...

17:57.510 --> 17:58.511
>> CAITLYN: I think it's just

17:58.511 --> 18:00.147
harder for... I don't know.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.181
My guy friends-- what do you

18:01.181 --> 18:02.182
think?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.183
>> PAM: I think they're gonna be

18:03.183 --> 18:04.817
much more supportive than you

18:04.817 --> 18:06.386
think.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.155
They're gonna meet Caitlyn and

18:08.155 --> 18:09.222
they're gonna say, "Same

18:09.222 --> 18:11.924
personality."

18:11.924 --> 18:12.925
>> CAITLYN: But I don't know if

18:12.925 --> 18:13.926
they get it, I don't know if

18:13.926 --> 18:14.927
guys get that.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.928
>> PAM: Hold on, I'm getting

18:15.928 --> 18:16.463
warm.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.464
>> CAITLYN: I don't know, girls

18:17.464 --> 18:18.465
just seem to be easier, you

18:18.465 --> 18:19.466
know?

18:19.466 --> 18:20.467
>> PAM: Yes, we are.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.501
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.669
Oh, we are-- don't start

18:22.669 --> 18:23.670
bragging on me.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.837
Let's go, get over there, I'll

18:24.837 --> 18:26.373
show you.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.407
>> PAM: See how I hit 'em right

18:27.407 --> 18:28.575
to you, to be nice?

18:28.575 --> 18:29.576
Oops.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.210
>> CAITLYN: Hup, I got it!

18:30.210 --> 18:31.211
>> PAM: Oh, it's legal, it's

18:31.211 --> 18:32.212
legal.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.213
Uh-oh.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.214
I... aah!

18:34.214 --> 18:36.183
(Pam laughs)

18:36.183 --> 18:37.617
I love it.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.618
>> CAITLYN: Now I know why girls

18:38.618 --> 18:40.086
need a sports bra.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.087
(Pam laughs)

18:41.087 --> 18:42.189
When you start running, it gets

18:42.189 --> 18:43.223
a little tougher, doesn't it?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.224
>> PAM: Yeah.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.193
Get in.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.194
>> CAITLYN: The hair got in my

18:47.194 --> 18:48.195
eyes again.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.362
(Pam laughing)

18:49.362 --> 18:50.497
Bruce was a lot better tennis

18:50.497 --> 18:51.664
player than Caitlyn is.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.065
>> PAM: Yeah.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.066
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.067
>> PAM: It was fun.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.303
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it was fun.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.271
It was fun.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.613
(indistinct chatter)

19:06.613 --> 19:08.281
(footsteps approaching)

19:08.281 --> 19:10.317
>> KYLIE: Hello?!

19:10.317 --> 19:11.718
>> PAM: Oh, my goodness.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.321
I haven't seen you in so long.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.488
>> KYLIE: Hey, Aunt Lisa.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.489
>> LISA: How are you?

19:16.489 --> 19:16.989
>> KYLIE: Good.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.990
>> LISA: You look so pretty.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.991
>> KYLIE: Oh, thank you.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.727
>> MADDIE: Aah!

19:20.727 --> 19:22.028
I've missed you.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.330
>> KYLIE: I missed you.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.597
Where's my dad?

19:24.597 --> 19:28.368
>> MADDIE: He's in there.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.070
>> KYLIE: I do want to meet her.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.606
It'll be a little uncomfortable

19:33.606 --> 19:35.275
in the beginning.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.077
But I think we're both ready.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.078
Hey, pretty.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.079
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know, I

19:40.079 --> 19:42.014
know... Hey, baby!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.015
I didn't know you were here.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.016
>> KYLIE: You look so pretty.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.017
>> CAITLYN: Where did you just

19:45.017 --> 19:45.518
sneak in?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.519
>> KYLIE: Hey, Grandma.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.520
>> CAITLYN: Little Kylie made

19:47.520 --> 19:48.020
it.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.289
>> ESTHER: Oh, my... (kisses)

19:49.289 --> 19:50.290
>> CAITLYN: Mom's in the chair.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.259
>> KYLIE: How are you?

19:52.259 --> 19:53.360
Are you getting pretty?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.361
>> ESTHER: I'm having fun.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.362
>> KYLIE: Oh, yay.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.028
>> ESTHER: I have a little

19:56.028 --> 19:57.264
present for you.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.265
>> KYLIE: I'm excited.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.266
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.433
Okay, you want to do it?

20:00.433 --> 20:00.933
>> ESTHER: Okay.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.934
>> CAITLYN: Okay, come on.

20:01.934 --> 20:02.935
(Esther chuckles)

20:02.935 --> 20:03.703
>> CAITLYN: Okay...

20:03.703 --> 20:04.704
>> ESTHER: I thought...

20:04.704 --> 20:06.273
I thought you should have this.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.841
It's me when I was 17.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.842
>> KYLIE: Oh, my God.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.843
>> CAITLYN: When she was your

20:10.843 --> 20:11.344
age.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.345
>> KYLIE: Wait, we kind of look

20:12.345 --> 20:12.845
alike.

20:12.845 --> 20:13.846
>> ESTHER: We do kind of look

20:13.846 --> 20:14.414
alike, don't we?

20:14.414 --> 20:15.415
>> CAITLYN: I know, you do.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.249
>> KYLIE: I definitely take the

20:16.249 --> 20:17.250
Jenner side, 'cause...

20:17.250 --> 20:17.984
>> CAITLYN: And here's the

20:17.984 --> 20:19.886
kicker: she was 17 years old in

20:19.886 --> 20:20.887
this picture...

20:20.887 --> 20:21.888
>> ESTHER: Married to...

20:21.888 --> 20:22.555
>> CAITLYN: ...and she was

20:22.555 --> 20:23.556
married.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.223
>> ESTHER: And...

20:24.223 --> 20:25.224
>> KYLIE: Kind of like... kind

20:25.224 --> 20:25.925
of like me.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.926
>> CAITLYN: Uh, uh, but, you...

20:26.926 --> 20:28.561
I better not hear that from you.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.263
Yes, yes, yes.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.564
My big concern, obviously, from

20:31.564 --> 20:33.400
the beginning-- besides all the

20:33.400 --> 20:34.434
rest of the kids-- is Kendall

20:34.434 --> 20:35.435
and Kylie.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.436
Isn't that cool?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.070
>> KYLIE: I love it.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.506
So pretty.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.507
>> CAITLYN: Once it was out

20:40.507 --> 20:41.974
there, they saw the support that

20:41.974 --> 20:44.043
I was getting, especially in the

20:44.043 --> 20:46.279
celebrity world.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.647
From the Lady Gagas of the world

20:47.647 --> 20:50.483
to Miley Cyrus to Elton John.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.218
To see their support, I think it

20:52.218 --> 20:54.821
really made my kids feel--

20:54.821 --> 20:56.122
especially Kylie-- that it's

20:56.122 --> 20:58.124
gonna be okay.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.359
>> SPENCER: How's Kenny?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.360
>> KYLIE: She's good, I don't

21:00.360 --> 21:00.993
know, she's so busy.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.061
>> CAITLYN: She's in Cannes

21:02.061 --> 21:02.695
right now.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.896
>> KYLIE: Let me see your hair.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.464
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.231
>> KYLIE: You should get

21:05.231 --> 21:05.865
extensions.

21:05.865 --> 21:06.733
>> CAITLYN: Oh, we would never

21:06.733 --> 21:07.734
use extensions, would we?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.234
>> KYLIE: No.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.235
>> CAITLYN: No, not in a million

21:09.235 --> 21:09.736
years, would we?

21:09.736 --> 21:10.737
>> KYLIE: Where are the ones

21:10.737 --> 21:11.237
that I gave you?

21:11.237 --> 21:12.238
>> CAITLYN: Uh, in the other

21:12.238 --> 21:13.239
room.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.341
>> KYLIE: I want to put them in.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.342
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.677
I got no problem with Kylie.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.878
After the first five minutes,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.012
it's like, "All right...

21:20.012 --> 21:21.013
it's Caitlyn-- big deal."

21:21.013 --> 21:22.014
>> KYLIE: I was, like, looking

21:22.014 --> 21:23.015
at Google pictures of you when I

21:23.015 --> 21:24.016
was trying to pick the hair

21:24.016 --> 21:25.017
color, and then you dyed it on

21:25.017 --> 21:26.018
me.

21:26.018 --> 21:26.753
(all laugh)

21:26.753 --> 21:27.754
>> ESTHER: Does it match your

21:27.754 --> 21:28.254
eyes?

21:28.254 --> 21:29.255
>> COURTNEY: Don't look, don't

21:29.255 --> 21:29.889
look!

21:29.889 --> 21:30.890
>> CAITLYN: Sorry.

21:30.890 --> 21:31.391
(all laugh)

21:31.391 --> 21:32.525
I almost peeked, I'm sorry.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.526
>> COURTNEY: Don't ruin it.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.527
>> CAITLYN: Isn't this more fun

21:34.527 --> 21:35.562
than sitting around talking

21:35.562 --> 21:36.563
about sports?

21:36.563 --> 21:37.564
>> KYLIE: Mm-hmm.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.565
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's what I

21:38.565 --> 21:39.566
thought.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.700
>> SPENCER: Or watching golf.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.701
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, or watching

21:41.701 --> 21:42.735
golf.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.770
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

21:43.770 --> 21:44.771
>> KYLIE: Or playing golf?

21:44.771 --> 21:45.772
>> CAITLYN: Or playing golf.

21:45.772 --> 21:46.773
Well, I don't know if I can go

21:46.773 --> 21:47.574
quite that far.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.575
>> COURTNEY: Look at yourself,

21:48.575 --> 21:49.075
look.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.076
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, wait, wait...

21:50.076 --> 21:51.077
Kylie.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.479
>> SPENCER: I know, right?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.113
Look how long it is.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.114
>> KYLIE: Lean back.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.215
>> ESTHER: Wow.

21:56.215 --> 21:56.716
>> KYLIE: Look.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.717
>> CAITLYN: Could be Caitlyn's

21:57.717 --> 21:58.217
first post.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.218
And they would never know who it

21:59.218 --> 21:59.719
is.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.720
>> SPENCER: They'd be, like,

22:00.720 --> 22:01.220
"Oh!"

22:01.220 --> 22:02.288
>> KYLIE: What do you want to

22:02.288 --> 22:02.789
say?

22:02.789 --> 22:03.790
>> CAITLYN: A good friend

22:03.790 --> 22:04.791
modeling my new extensions, or

22:04.791 --> 22:05.558
something like that.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.559
>> KYLIE: I don't want to say

22:06.559 --> 22:07.259
"a good friend."

22:07.259 --> 22:08.260
>> CAITLYN: Okay, uh...

22:08.260 --> 22:09.228
>> RONDA: My dad?

22:09.228 --> 22:10.162
>> CAITLYN: My dad?

22:10.162 --> 22:10.763
(everyone laughs)

22:10.763 --> 22:12.231
>> CAITLYN: Having that

22:12.231 --> 22:14.401
opportunity to just be honest

22:14.401 --> 22:15.702
with your family-- it's like

22:15.702 --> 22:17.404
somebody taking a thousand

22:17.404 --> 22:19.071
pounds off my shoulders.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.607
Besides, most people, once they

22:20.607 --> 22:22.208
meet Caitlyn, they go, "Oh, my

22:22.208 --> 22:23.776
God, she's more fun than Bruce

22:23.776 --> 22:24.777
ever was."

22:24.777 --> 22:25.778
>> KYLIE: I love you.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.013
>> CAITLYN: Okay, I love you,

22:27.013 --> 22:28.280
too.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.049
And everything's gonna be good.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.050
>> KYLIE: I'll see you tomorrow.

22:31.050 --> 22:31.718
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate you

22:31.718 --> 22:32.719
coming out and being

22:32.719 --> 22:33.219
understanding.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.220
>> KYLIE: Of course, I love you.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.221
>> CAITLYN: Good.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.222
Bye, buddy.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.190
>> KYLIE: Bye!

22:46.098 --> 22:48.100
>> CAITLYN: All these pants I'll

22:48.100 --> 22:49.969
never use again.

22:49.969 --> 22:50.970
>> PAM: Yeah, where'd you put

22:50.970 --> 22:51.971
the other hangers?

22:51.971 --> 22:52.972
Are they underneath?

22:52.972 --> 22:53.973
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.675
Here's the question-- I hate to

22:55.675 --> 22:57.810
say it, but...

22:57.810 --> 22:58.911
what the hell was Bruce

22:58.911 --> 22:59.912
thinking?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.481
>> PAM: (laughs) You prob...

23:01.481 --> 23:02.482
it was probably a Christmas

23:02.482 --> 23:03.483
present.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.817
>> CAITLYN: That is one ugly

23:04.817 --> 23:05.852
shirt.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.253
Considering I've had all these

23:07.253 --> 23:08.254
clothes down here for six

23:08.254 --> 23:09.255
months, I guess I really don't

23:09.255 --> 23:10.256
need anything that's here,

23:10.256 --> 23:11.257
right?

23:11.257 --> 23:11.758
>> PAM: Yeah.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.759
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.227
Anyway, how's Mom doing?

23:16.996 --> 23:18.998
>> PAM: She hasn't said a word

23:18.998 --> 23:20.199
to me, privately.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.200
>> CAITLYN: Really?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.201
>> PAM: Yeah, no, I think

23:22.201 --> 23:24.303
she's... she's...

23:24.303 --> 23:25.304
>> CAITLYN: I just, you know,

23:25.304 --> 23:26.305
sit here and...

23:26.305 --> 23:27.306
>> PAM: Wonder.

23:27.306 --> 23:28.307
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I wonder.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.477
Everybody's very positive and

23:30.477 --> 23:32.044
everybody feels really good

23:32.044 --> 23:33.713
about all this stuff, but, you

23:33.713 --> 23:36.849
know, I'm kind of waiting.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.150
>> PAM: And you're waiting for?

23:38.150 --> 23:39.151
>> CAITLYN: Well, I'm waiting

23:39.151 --> 23:41.353
for, you know, Mom to go-- in a

23:41.353 --> 23:43.189
quiet time-- "Oh, my God, what's

23:43.189 --> 23:44.624
happening?"

23:44.624 --> 23:46.092
Even Kylie coming over today--

23:46.092 --> 23:47.627
you never know, you know, when

23:47.627 --> 23:48.761
they get away from here and they

23:48.761 --> 23:50.162
go home, they go, "Oh, my God,

23:50.162 --> 23:51.263
that was so strange."

23:51.263 --> 23:52.965
I mean, she has not met Caitlyn.

23:52.965 --> 23:53.966
She was kind of shocked.

23:53.966 --> 23:54.967
>> PAM: Kylie hadn't?

23:54.967 --> 23:55.968
>> CAITLYN: No, no.

23:55.968 --> 23:56.969
She would never come over.

23:56.969 --> 23:57.704
>> PAM: I didn't know that.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.705
>> CAITLYN: I would invite her

23:58.705 --> 23:59.706
over and this and that,

23:59.706 --> 24:00.773
she would never come.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.241
Khloe hasn't been here.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.010
Kourtney hasn't been here,

24:04.010 --> 24:05.144
hasn't met Caitlyn.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.713
Um...

24:06.713 --> 24:07.847
Rob.

24:07.847 --> 24:08.848
>> PAM: No?

24:08.848 --> 24:09.916
>> CAITLYN: You know?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.685
Maybe... them not being around

24:12.685 --> 24:15.555
is, you know, kind of their way

24:15.555 --> 24:16.723
of saying, "I don't know if I

24:16.723 --> 24:18.090
really agree with this" or what

24:18.090 --> 24:19.091
or...

24:19.091 --> 24:20.092
You know, they keep saying to

24:20.092 --> 24:21.661
me, openly, that, "Everybody's

24:21.661 --> 24:22.662
great, it's great, we want you

24:22.662 --> 24:23.963
to live your life."

24:23.963 --> 24:25.264
And then they never show up.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.298
So you know something else is

24:26.298 --> 24:29.569
going on in their head.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.870
You know, for most people,

24:30.870 --> 24:31.971
dealing with something like

24:31.971 --> 24:33.105
this, there's a lot of families

24:33.105 --> 24:34.741
that just are...

24:34.741 --> 24:35.875
>> PAM: Torn apart, I'm sure.

24:35.875 --> 24:36.876
>> CAITLYN: Torn apart by it,

24:36.876 --> 24:38.010
you know?

24:38.010 --> 24:39.679
Um, I don't want to tear my

24:39.679 --> 24:41.648
family apart.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.324
Now that Pam and Lisa have gone,

24:52.324 --> 24:53.325
we can actually talk.

24:53.325 --> 24:53.826
>> ESTHER: I know.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.827
>> CAITLYN: I know, that's kind

24:54.827 --> 24:55.828
of nice.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.829
>> ESTHER: I really didn't want

24:56.829 --> 24:57.830
to go to the beach.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.831
>> CAITLYN: This beach down

24:58.831 --> 25:00.600
here-- it's a-a lo... tough walk

25:00.600 --> 25:01.668
to get down to the beach, 'cause

25:01.668 --> 25:02.669
you got to walk down that...

25:02.669 --> 25:03.670
Yeah.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.771
>> ESTHER: As you are right now,

25:04.771 --> 25:05.772
as I look at you...

25:05.772 --> 25:06.773
>> CAITLYN: Right.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.174
>> ESTHER: You look so much like

25:08.174 --> 25:10.743
someone in my family, and I was

25:10.743 --> 25:12.244
trying to figure it out.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.380
>> CAITLYN: Um, I think I look

25:14.380 --> 25:15.582
like myself, Mom.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.583
>> ESTHER: Huh.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.584
>> CAITLYN: Because the most

25:17.584 --> 25:18.751
important thing in life is that

25:18.751 --> 25:20.052
you're true to yourself, and I'm

25:20.052 --> 25:21.453
doing better now than I've ever

25:21.453 --> 25:22.488
done before in my life, you

25:22.488 --> 25:23.890
know?

25:23.890 --> 25:24.891
>> ESTHER: It's going to be so

25:24.891 --> 25:27.594
difficult for me...

25:27.594 --> 25:31.163
to c... to think of you as "she"

25:31.163 --> 25:35.134
and to say "Caitlyn" when I want

25:35.134 --> 25:37.870
to speak with you or call your

25:37.870 --> 25:40.607
attention or...

25:40.607 --> 25:42.174
you know...

25:42.174 --> 25:43.743
"Hey, Caitlyn" instead of "Hey,

25:43.743 --> 25:45.712
Bruce."

25:49.916 --> 25:53.686
I don't think... It's not easy.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.521
It's not easy.

25:55.521 --> 25:59.458
>> CAITLYN: No, it's not easy.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.962
What aspect is it not easy?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.931
Losing a son?

26:17.810 --> 26:19.812
>> ESTHER: I don't think... it's

26:19.812 --> 26:22.548
not easy.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.250
It's not easy.

26:24.250 --> 26:28.220
>> CAITLYN: No, it's not easy.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.323
What aspect is it not easy?

26:31.323 --> 26:34.661
Losing a son?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.729
>> ESTHER: The problem before

26:36.729 --> 26:40.566
with you and I, I... I'm

26:40.566 --> 26:43.169
guessing this-- you felt

26:43.169 --> 26:46.372
uncomfortable with me.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.040
We would see each other, and it

26:48.040 --> 26:49.475
was like you wanted to get away.

26:49.475 --> 26:50.977
>> CAITLYN: At that point in my

26:50.977 --> 26:52.879
life, I was very much an

26:52.879 --> 26:55.181
isolationist.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.749
I would isolate myself from the

26:56.749 --> 26:59.351
world on many, many, many, many

26:59.351 --> 27:00.586
occasions.

27:00.586 --> 27:01.788
'Cause I never felt like I fit

27:01.788 --> 27:03.389
in anywhere.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.691
I didn't fit in with the male

27:04.691 --> 27:06.058
side, I didn't fit in with the

27:06.058 --> 27:07.226
female side.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.227
You're kind of stuck in the

27:08.227 --> 27:09.862
middle.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.698
I feel like Caitlyn fits in a

27:11.698 --> 27:13.232
lot better into society, uh,

27:13.232 --> 27:14.767
than Bruce ever did, 'cause

27:14.767 --> 27:16.703
Bruce, uh, had to lie about all

27:16.703 --> 27:18.104
that sort of stuff, where

27:18.104 --> 27:19.305
Caitlyn's kind of got a place.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.372
>> ESTHER: But Bruce will always

27:20.372 --> 27:21.708
be in there.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.042
Your values are always gonna be

27:23.042 --> 27:24.310
the same.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.712
>> CAITLYN: Oh, same.

27:25.712 --> 27:26.713
I'm still the same person.

27:26.713 --> 27:27.714
>> ESTHER: That's not changing.

27:27.714 --> 27:28.715
That's your soul.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.716
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's your

27:29.716 --> 27:30.817
soul-- that's exactly right.

27:30.817 --> 27:31.984
>> ESTHER: You-you have the same

27:31.984 --> 27:34.053
soul you were born with.

27:34.053 --> 27:37.323
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.092
>> ESTHER: I love Bruce.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.928
It'll never change.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.997
That'll never change.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.398
It's going to take some getting

27:46.398 --> 27:50.002
used to.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.171
But I want... I want to do what

27:52.171 --> 27:55.074
he wants.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.408
>> CAITLYN: And the response has

27:56.408 --> 27:57.777
been very good, so that even

27:57.777 --> 27:58.878
makes it better, you know?

27:58.878 --> 28:00.112
If the response was, "Oh, my

28:00.112 --> 28:02.081
God, what a weirdo," uh, it

28:02.081 --> 28:04.751
would be a lot more difficult.

28:04.751 --> 28:05.952
But people have really been

28:05.952 --> 28:08.020
behind my honesty, and I really

28:08.020 --> 28:10.322
appreciate that.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.024
I'm very optimistic about the

28:12.024 --> 28:13.325
future, and I'm dragging you

28:13.325 --> 28:14.827
along with me.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.029
>> ESTHER: (chuckles) Okay.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.064
>> CAITLYN: Okay, good, good.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.065
>> ESTHER: Okay.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.399
>> CAITLYN: Here's my attitude,

28:20.399 --> 28:21.400
when you go through what I'm

28:21.400 --> 28:22.668
going through, it affects a lot

28:22.668 --> 28:23.870
of people.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.138
My entire family kind of has to

28:26.138 --> 28:27.406
go through this...

28:27.406 --> 28:28.775
called "transition."

28:28.775 --> 28:30.176
And all those things will be

28:30.176 --> 28:31.778
worked out in time.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.179
All right.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.280
Maybe I should get this wild

28:34.280 --> 28:36.148
color hair out.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.217
Right now, what I want to do is

28:38.217 --> 28:39.585
just be able to create

28:39.585 --> 28:41.487
understanding so the next person

28:41.487 --> 28:44.523
doesn't have to be like me.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.092
We have to be able to reach out,

28:46.092 --> 28:48.895
one soul at a time, and figure

28:48.895 --> 28:51.697
this problem out.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.534
>> REPORTER: Kyler Prescott, a

28:55.534 --> 28:57.036
local transgender teen, has

28:57.036 --> 28:58.604
taken his own life...

28:58.604 --> 28:59.939
>> CAITLYN: Another suicide.

28:59.939 --> 29:00.940
>> REPORTER: ...making this the

29:00.940 --> 29:02.408
third suicide of a transgender

29:02.408 --> 29:03.910
youth this year.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.144
His mother spoke out in an

29:05.144 --> 29:06.913
emotional interview.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.280
>> KATHARINE: I think the world

29:08.280 --> 29:10.149
was kind of too hard a place for

29:10.149 --> 29:11.851
such a gentle soul.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.452
He didn't understand cruelty.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.521
He didn't understand people that

29:15.521 --> 29:17.523
didn't understand him.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.259
(sighs) It's tough.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.694
He would fill the house with his

29:22.694 --> 29:24.663
piano music, and the house has

29:24.663 --> 29:27.299
just been silent, um, since he

29:27.299 --> 29:28.835
left.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.871
The music stopped.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.539
>> LISA: Wow.

29:33.539 --> 29:34.640
>> CAITLYN: That's the problem.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.075
That's-that's the problem that

29:36.075 --> 29:37.910
we have here is it happens all

29:37.910 --> 29:42.481
the time.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.851
Suicide is a permanent solution

29:44.851 --> 29:47.186
for a very temporary problem,

29:47.186 --> 29:48.720
and most of the ones that are at

29:48.720 --> 29:51.490
risk are these young kids, okay?

29:51.490 --> 29:52.324
>> ESTHER: They're-they're still

29:52.324 --> 29:53.159
children.

29:53.159 --> 29:53.860
>> CAITLYN: Got their whole life

29:53.860 --> 29:54.326
ahead of 'em.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.461
It just doesn't need to happen.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.396
That kind of hit home.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.232
I know how these kids can feel.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.702
I've had some very dark moments

30:03.702 --> 30:06.305
in my life.

30:06.305 --> 30:10.442
I have been in my house...

30:10.442 --> 30:13.479
with a gun and said...

30:13.479 --> 30:15.915
Let's just end it right here.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.984
Um, no more pain, no more

30:17.984 --> 30:21.753
suffering."

30:21.753 --> 30:24.523
That struggle...

30:24.523 --> 30:26.592
it's real.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.928
And I've been there.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.867
(birds chirping)

30:34.867 --> 30:36.168
>> KIM: Hello.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.269
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

30:37.269 --> 30:38.604
Look who's here!

30:38.604 --> 30:39.605
>> KIM: You look beautiful.

30:39.605 --> 30:40.606
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you very

30:40.606 --> 30:41.607
much-- not as good as you.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.608
Good to see you.

30:42.608 --> 30:43.609
>> KANYE: What up?

30:43.609 --> 30:44.610
>> CAITLYN: Good to see you.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.611
Thanks. Come on in.

30:45.611 --> 30:46.612
Welcome to my home.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.613
>> KIM: Hi.

30:47.613 --> 30:48.614
>> PAM: Long time no see.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.615
>> CAITLYN: Sister Pam.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.616
>> PAM: We know each other.

30:50.616 --> 30:51.617
>> CAITLYN: My older sister.

30:51.617 --> 30:52.118
>> PAM: We haven't met.

30:52.118 --> 30:52.818
Nice to meet you.

30:52.818 --> 30:53.685
>> KANYE: Hey, how are you?

30:53.685 --> 30:54.720
>> CAITLYN: Kanye and I have

30:54.720 --> 30:56.722
never really been very close,

30:56.722 --> 30:58.257
but, um, I love his

30:58.257 --> 31:00.226
open-mindedness, and I love how

31:00.226 --> 31:03.262
he's helped Kim come to grips

31:03.262 --> 31:04.530
with what's going on.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.697
>> KIM: You look beautiful.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.099
You know, the one thing I'm

31:07.099 --> 31:08.134
really shocked about is how

31:08.134 --> 31:10.669
skinny... you are.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.938
You literally look like Kendall.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.639
Like Kendall's mom.

31:13.639 --> 31:14.640
(laughter)

31:14.640 --> 31:15.641
>> KANYE: I mean, I think this

31:15.641 --> 31:16.943
is one of the strongest things

31:16.943 --> 31:17.977
that have happened in our, you

31:17.977 --> 31:20.779
know, existence as human beings

31:20.779 --> 31:21.780
that are so controlled by

31:21.780 --> 31:23.615
perception.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.683
'Cause you couldn't have been up

31:24.683 --> 31:25.684
against more.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.685
Like, your daughter's a

31:26.685 --> 31:27.686
supermodel.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.687
You're a celebrity.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.289
You have every type of thing,

31:30.289 --> 31:32.091
and it was still like, "(bleep)

31:32.091 --> 31:33.092
everybody.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.060
This is who I am."

31:34.060 --> 31:34.994
>> CAITLYN: This is all good.

31:34.994 --> 31:35.962
>> KIM: This is just the

31:35.962 --> 31:36.662
beginning.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.296
>> CAITLYN: This is all good.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.297
>> KIM: Just the beginning.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.298
>> ESTHER: Are you gonna take

31:39.298 --> 31:40.299
your coat off?

31:40.299 --> 31:41.300
I want to see what you're

31:41.300 --> 31:42.301
wearing.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.702
>> KIM: Oh, nothing hardly fits

31:43.702 --> 31:45.237
anymore, so it's, like, a

31:45.237 --> 31:46.238
half-zipped-up skirt.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.239
>> ESTHER: I read that you're

31:47.239 --> 31:48.240
expecting.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.241
>> PAM: That's right.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.509
>> KIM: Yes. Yes, yes.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.643
>> PAM: Congratulations.

31:51.643 --> 31:52.644
>> KIM: Thank you.

31:52.644 --> 31:53.645
We've wanted this for a long

31:53.645 --> 31:54.646
time.

31:54.646 --> 31:55.714
>> PAM: That's wonderful.

31:55.714 --> 31:56.848
>> KIM: Yeah.

31:56.848 --> 31:57.984
>> PAM: So, tell me about the

31:57.984 --> 31:59.251
untied shoelaces.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.486
>> KANYE: These are sock shoes,

32:00.486 --> 32:02.254
so they, like...

32:02.254 --> 32:03.555
>> PAM: Oh, yeah.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.824
Oh, look at how light they are.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.393
>> KANYE: Yeah. But the laces

32:07.393 --> 32:08.727
are sort of after the fact.

32:08.727 --> 32:09.996
>> PAM: Yeah. Not necessary to

32:09.996 --> 32:11.030
keep 'em on your feet.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.031
>> KANYE: Yeah.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.099
>> PAM: Yeah. Okay.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.833
I just wanted to be cool, so...

32:14.833 --> 32:17.169
(laughter)

32:17.169 --> 32:18.170
>> KIM: All right, can I see

32:18.170 --> 32:19.738
these new things in your closet?

32:19.738 --> 32:20.739
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.142
They gave me a ton of stuff.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.410
Tom Ford stuff.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.145
Diane von Furstenberg sent me

32:26.145 --> 32:27.479
this-- three, three outfits.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.015
>> KIM: Ooh. I like that.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.382
That's so nice.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.383
I like the plain black.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.384
>> CAITLYN: Yeah... this is all

32:32.384 --> 32:33.385
kind of a little bit more casual

32:33.385 --> 32:34.386
stuff here.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.387
This is all vanity...

32:35.387 --> 32:36.388
>> KIM: These color tones are so

32:36.388 --> 32:37.389
much better than what you had

32:37.389 --> 32:38.390
before.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.391
Like, I was secretly dying in

32:39.391 --> 32:40.392
your last closet.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.393
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, secretly

32:41.393 --> 32:42.394
dying?

32:42.394 --> 32:43.395
Yeah, this is all just kind of

32:43.395 --> 32:45.664
very casual, good stuff.

32:45.664 --> 32:46.598
>> KIM: But this has got to go.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.033
Like... this...?

32:47.033 --> 32:48.034
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Oh, I agree.

32:48.034 --> 32:48.900
And that's the one they caught

32:48.900 --> 32:49.801
me in.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.702
>> KIM: I know.

32:50.702 --> 32:51.437
>> CAITLYN: I said, "Oh, my God,

32:51.437 --> 32:52.238
Kim's gonna shoot me."

32:52.238 --> 32:53.039
>> KIM: Oh, it looks black and

32:53.039 --> 32:54.040
white-- no, this has got to go.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.174
I said that last time I saw it.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.143
>> CAITLYN: I love this Tom Ford

32:57.143 --> 32:58.377
dress.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.378
>> KIM: Mom has that.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.379
>> CAITLYN: What's that?

33:00.379 --> 33:01.380
>> KIM: Mom has that.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.581
>> CAITLYN: Um...

33:02.581 --> 33:03.582
>> KIM: So it'll be like a

33:03.582 --> 33:04.583
"Who Wore It Better?"

33:04.583 --> 33:05.351
>> CAITLYN: Actually, no, no,

33:05.351 --> 33:05.951
"Who Wore It Best?"

33:05.951 --> 33:06.952
>> KIM: She has it in chocolate

33:06.952 --> 33:07.519
brown.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.287
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no.

33:08.287 --> 33:08.920
We got to do that.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.356
Isn't that... Wouldn't that be

33:10.356 --> 33:11.657
the funniest thing ever?

33:11.657 --> 33:12.691
>> KIM: Yes... No, you should

33:12.691 --> 33:13.859
just come over, like, at a time

33:13.859 --> 33:14.593
where, you know, I know

33:14.593 --> 33:15.594
she's there.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.128
>> CAITLYN: Right.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.129
>> KIM: And I'll just pick out

33:17.129 --> 33:18.130
an outfit for her to wear, and

33:18.130 --> 33:19.131
I'll say, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna

33:19.131 --> 33:19.965
take you to dinner.

33:19.965 --> 33:20.666
You should wear this."

33:20.666 --> 33:21.267
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

33:21.267 --> 33:21.967
>> KIM: And then you should

33:21.967 --> 33:22.568
stop by...

33:22.568 --> 33:23.269
>> CAITLYN: And we'll both

33:23.269 --> 33:24.236
have the same outfit.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.237
That is...

33:25.237 --> 33:26.238
>> KIM: Yes... (laughs)

33:26.238 --> 33:27.439
>> CAITLYN: That is funny.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.740
I better wear it before she

33:28.740 --> 33:30.209
does.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.477
>> KIM: Very cool.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.911
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:32.911 --> 33:33.912
>> PAM: Oh, there they are.

33:33.912 --> 33:34.913
>> CAITLYN: They're leaving.

33:34.913 --> 33:35.947
And so are you guys.

33:35.947 --> 33:36.948
>> ESTHER: Good to see you

33:36.948 --> 33:37.949
again.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.218
>> KIM: Of course.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.486
Bye, everyone.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.487
>> CAITLYN: Bye, babe!

33:41.487 --> 33:42.488
I know. All right, good-bye,

33:42.488 --> 33:43.355
Mom.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.856
You're out of here, too.

33:44.856 --> 33:45.857
>> PAM: We'll see you soon.

33:45.857 --> 33:46.725
>> ESTHER: Bye, Bruce.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.293
>> CAITLYN: All right, have

33:47.293 --> 33:47.926
a good trip back.

33:47.926 --> 33:48.694
>> ESTHER: I love you.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.395
>> CAITLYN: Love you, too.

33:49.395 --> 33:50.396
>> ESTHER: I always did and I

33:50.396 --> 33:51.397
always will.

33:51.397 --> 33:52.598
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.599
It's 'cause I got this adorable

33:53.599 --> 33:55.167
personality.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.368
That's what it is.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.703
It's the adorable personality.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.937
>> ESTHER: I like it better.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.106
>> CAITLYN: Oh, good, good.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.107
Okay, good.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.242
>> ESTHER: I was so proud of

34:03.242 --> 34:05.444
Bruce when he stood on that

34:05.444 --> 34:07.879
podium, receiving that gold

34:07.879 --> 34:10.116
medal in Montreal.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.918
And I had tears and the American

34:12.918 --> 34:15.354
flag was going up in the middle,

34:15.354 --> 34:17.323
and I thought I could never be

34:17.323 --> 34:20.025
more proud of him.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.928
And, you know, I was wrong.

34:22.928 --> 34:26.432
Because I am more proud of him

34:26.432 --> 34:28.867
for the courage that he has

34:28.867 --> 34:32.371
shown.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.141
I loved him with all my heart,

34:35.141 --> 34:36.708
and I certainly love her with

34:36.708 --> 34:39.678
all my heart.

34:45.951 --> 34:49.788
(crickets chirping)

34:49.788 --> 34:53.559
(water running)

34:53.559 --> 34:54.793
>> CAITLYN: For me, the most

34:54.793 --> 34:55.961
important thing is to learn

34:55.961 --> 34:58.264
about other people.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.932
So far, down in San Diego, there

35:00.932 --> 35:03.402
has been three suicides of trans

35:03.402 --> 35:05.437
teens.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.173
It's devastating.

35:07.173 --> 35:10.842
Kyler Prescott, 14 years old,

35:10.842 --> 35:12.744
had his whole life ahead of him.

35:12.744 --> 35:17.383
14... years... old.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.584
I reached out to Katharine, his

35:18.584 --> 35:20.386
mother, and I want to spend a

35:20.386 --> 35:22.388
little bit of time with her and

35:22.388 --> 35:24.223
find out what we can do to make

35:24.223 --> 35:25.457
a difference.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.226
Under the cover of darkness.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.195
So, heading for San Diego.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.363
I'd say we go up the hill.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.199
They'll never see us.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.200
>> DRIVER: Uh, they're waiting

35:34.200 --> 35:35.201
up there, too.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.202
>> CAITLYN: The key to this trip

35:36.202 --> 35:37.436
is a clean break from the

35:37.436 --> 35:38.770
paparazzi.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.206
Actually, we've only got one guy

35:40.206 --> 35:41.207
following us.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.208
>> DRIVER: They're posted all

35:42.208 --> 35:43.209
through the hill, so...

35:43.209 --> 35:45.444
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah.

35:45.444 --> 35:49.581
We just, uh... changed cars.

35:49.581 --> 35:53.319
Now I'm in this... luxury van.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.320
>> DRIVER: There's a silver

35:54.320 --> 35:55.621
Lexus up here parked.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.622
There he is.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.357
>> CAITLYN: I heard the price

35:58.357 --> 35:59.858
tag just for a picture of me is

35:59.858 --> 36:02.228
$250,000.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.362
They are extraordinarily

36:03.362 --> 36:05.130
aggressive.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.632
I don't want to bring that kind

36:06.632 --> 36:08.133
of tabloid attention to Kyler's

36:08.133 --> 36:09.235
family.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.869
Damn.

36:13.239 --> 36:14.506
>> CAITLYN: Now we're going to

36:14.506 --> 36:16.475
get a third car.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.945
It seems like we've lost the

36:19.945 --> 36:21.913
paparazzi.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.986
Every journey is different, and

36:27.986 --> 36:30.088
to learn those stories, it just

36:30.088 --> 36:32.458
kind of educates me.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.759
I can't even imagine what

36:33.759 --> 36:35.527
Kyler's family's going through.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.628
Uh, I don't know what I can do,

36:36.628 --> 36:38.330
at this point, but just be a

36:38.330 --> 36:40.299
friend.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.047
Hello. How are you?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.283
>> KATHARINE: Hi. I'm Katharine.

36:57.283 --> 36:58.284
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for

36:58.284 --> 36:59.285
inviting me down.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.286
>> KATHARINE: Thank you.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.287
>> CAITLYN: How are you doing?

37:01.287 --> 37:02.354
>> KATHARINE: Hanging in there.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.355
>> CAITLYN: Hello.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.356
>> KATHARINE: This is Chloe.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.357
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.358
>> CARL: I'm Carl.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.359
>> CAITLYN: Hi. Nice to meet

37:07.359 --> 37:08.360
you, Carl.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.895
Thanks for inviting me down.

37:09.895 --> 37:10.896
What a cute kid.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.897
>> KATHARINE: I know.

37:11.897 --> 37:12.898
He is, huh?

37:12.898 --> 37:13.899
>> CAITLYN: Look at that.

37:13.899 --> 37:14.900
Love the hair.

37:14.900 --> 37:15.901
>> KATHARINE: Yeah. He was a

37:15.901 --> 37:17.303
beautiful kid with a beautiful

37:17.303 --> 37:18.870
soul.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.640
Kyler was truly an amazing...

37:21.640 --> 37:23.309
an amazing kid.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.544
I was proud of him for working

37:25.544 --> 37:26.778
so hard to be his authentic

37:26.778 --> 37:27.779
self.

37:27.779 --> 37:28.780
>> CAITLYN: From a parent's

37:28.780 --> 37:31.717
perspective, when... you know,

37:31.717 --> 37:32.784
this kind of probably came out

37:32.784 --> 37:33.785
of left field...

37:33.785 --> 37:34.786
>> KATHARINE: Absolutely.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.854
Um, I knew nothing about it when

37:35.854 --> 37:37.088
we started.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.590
I just luckily had an open mind

37:38.590 --> 37:40.326
and an open heart from the

37:40.326 --> 37:41.327
beginning.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.061
From the very first day, I said,

37:43.061 --> 37:44.363
"Sweetheart, I love you.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.765
No matter what, I love you."

37:46.765 --> 37:48.334
And, unfortunately, not all

37:48.334 --> 37:49.635
transgender teens get that.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.669
Um...

37:50.669 --> 37:51.670
>> CAITLYN: That's for sure.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.671
>> KATHARINE: Yeah, I guess

37:52.671 --> 37:53.672
that's an understatement.

37:53.672 --> 37:54.840
That's something else I want

37:54.840 --> 37:56.742
people to understand is that

37:56.742 --> 37:59.044
even with this full support of

37:59.044 --> 38:00.646
your family, it's still a hard

38:00.646 --> 38:02.047
journey.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.382
People always assume when they

38:03.382 --> 38:05.116
talk to me that Kyler was

38:05.116 --> 38:08.086
bullied by other kids or

38:08.086 --> 38:09.621
something like that, and that's

38:09.621 --> 38:12.257
actually not really the case.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.960
Really where he had the most

38:14.960 --> 38:16.628
problems was with adults not

38:16.628 --> 38:18.096
understanding, people out in

38:18.096 --> 38:20.666
society that really didn't

38:20.666 --> 38:23.168
understand that he needed them

38:23.168 --> 38:24.936
to use a male pronoun.

38:24.936 --> 38:25.937
And he had a legal name and

38:25.937 --> 38:26.938
gender change.

38:26.938 --> 38:27.939
>> CAITLYN: Oh, he did?

38:27.939 --> 38:28.940
>> KATHARINE: He did.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.476
And the new birth certificate

38:30.476 --> 38:32.378
arrived, unfortunately, just a

38:32.378 --> 38:33.479
few days after he passed away.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.480
>> CAITLYN: No way.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.481
>> KATHARINE: Yeah.

38:35.481 --> 38:36.482
And that was heartbreaking

38:36.482 --> 38:37.949
because he would have loved to

38:37.949 --> 38:38.950
have seen the new birth

38:38.950 --> 38:39.951
certificate.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.952
>> CAITLYN: Loved it.

38:40.952 --> 38:41.987
>> KATHARINE: But I don't think

38:41.987 --> 38:45.090
any suicide is a sim... has a

38:45.090 --> 38:46.191
simple cause.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.793
It's always a complex set of

38:47.793 --> 38:49.428
things that are challenging that

38:49.428 --> 38:52.631
kid.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.765
>> CAITLYN: We need more

38:53.765 --> 38:55.934
tolerance and empathy towards

38:55.934 --> 38:57.469
other people.

38:57.469 --> 38:58.970
It's so hard for young people

38:58.970 --> 39:02.508
because they just don't...

39:02.508 --> 39:04.743
they-they can't see the future.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.545
And because of that, they become

39:06.545 --> 39:08.780
extraordinarily desperate, and

39:08.780 --> 39:12.150
suicide becomes an option.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.151
We have to do something about

39:13.151 --> 39:15.120
that.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.424
>> KATHARINE: He was gonna get

39:18.424 --> 39:19.257
there, and he was gonna

39:19.257 --> 39:20.058
do amazing things...

39:20.058 --> 39:21.059
>> CAITLYN: He was just...

39:21.059 --> 39:22.060
needed to turn that corner.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.061
>> KATHARINE: Yeah.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.062
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.063
>> KATHARINE: He was young,

39:25.063 --> 39:26.064
you know?

39:26.064 --> 39:27.332
He was still just 14, and at

39:27.332 --> 39:28.434
that age, they just don't

39:28.434 --> 39:30.268
realize they're gonna get

39:30.268 --> 39:31.302
through it, they can get through

39:31.302 --> 39:32.438
it, they can get to these

39:32.438 --> 39:33.672
wonderful things on the other

39:33.672 --> 39:34.673
side.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.341
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:36.341 --> 39:37.709
>> KATHARINE: Today some

39:37.709 --> 39:38.977
students are going to be doing

39:38.977 --> 39:40.512
a balloon release in Kyler's

39:40.512 --> 39:41.747
honor, which is so sweet.

39:41.747 --> 39:42.581
>> CAITLYN: That is nice.

39:42.581 --> 39:43.715
>> KATHARINE: So I would love it

39:43.715 --> 39:44.816
if you want to come and see.

39:44.816 --> 39:45.651
>> CAITLYN: I would be honored.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.652
I would love to meet everybody.

39:46.652 --> 39:47.653
>> KATHARINE: It will be a

39:47.653 --> 39:48.654
beautiful moment.

39:48.654 --> 39:49.655
>> CAITLYN: It will be.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.656
>> KATHARINE: This is a song

39:50.656 --> 39:52.123
that was written by a friend of

39:52.123 --> 39:53.625
ours.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.126
It's a beautiful song, and it

39:55.126 --> 39:57.496
was written... for Kyler.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.097
But it will speak to kids

39:59.097 --> 40:02.501
everywhere.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.535
>> SINGERS: * You wake in the

40:03.535 --> 40:06.004
morning but you can't seem to

40:06.004 --> 40:10.341
* Get out of your bed

40:10.341 --> 40:12.377
And the weight of the covers

40:12.377 --> 40:15.346
* Is the weight of the world

40:15.346 --> 40:18.016
Of the people who care if you're

40:18.016 --> 40:20.786
* A boy or a girl

40:20.786 --> 40:22.721
But there's just one thing you

40:22.721 --> 40:25.657
* Need to know

40:25.657 --> 40:27.192
Love you no matter what... *

40:27.192 --> 40:28.359
>> CAITLYN: Young people, they

40:28.359 --> 40:30.295
have to realize there is so much

40:30.295 --> 40:32.831
help out there.

40:32.831 --> 40:33.832
Thank you for telling your

40:33.832 --> 40:34.833
story.

40:34.833 --> 40:35.934
And sometimes it's not always

40:35.934 --> 40:37.703
the parents-- it's outside help.

40:37.703 --> 40:40.305
It's a friend, it's a therapist,

40:40.305 --> 40:42.073
organizations that are willing

40:42.073 --> 40:43.875
to help.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.010
It's somebody in your life that

40:45.010 --> 40:46.812
you can open up with and tell

40:46.812 --> 40:48.179
'em your feelings and what's

40:48.179 --> 40:49.180
happening in your head.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.181
>> MACY: Hi, I'm Macy.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.182
>> CAITLYN: Hello. Caitlyn.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.183
Nice to meet you.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.184
>> MACY: Nice to meet you.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.185
Thank you so much for coming.

40:54.185 --> 40:55.186
>> CAITLYN: Oh, thanks for

40:55.186 --> 40:56.187
having me.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.188
>> MACY: I'm gonna cry.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.390
Like, um... like, he was, like,

40:59.390 --> 41:00.391
the first friend that I made

41:00.391 --> 41:01.793
this year, and... I don't know,

41:01.793 --> 41:02.928
I've been... I've attempted

41:02.928 --> 41:05.263
suicide before, and it got

41:05.263 --> 41:06.998
better for me.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.433
I just... (sighs)

41:08.433 --> 41:09.434
It's not fair that he didn't get

41:09.434 --> 41:10.536
to see that it gets better.

41:10.536 --> 41:11.870
>> SINGERS: * Why does it have

41:11.870 --> 41:13.639
to be so hard?

41:13.639 --> 41:16.107
* I love you for being true to

41:16.107 --> 41:18.610
who you are *

41:18.610 --> 41:20.145
>> CAITLYN: Seek help.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.547
You just have to get through

41:21.547 --> 41:23.214
that day.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.215
>> BOY: All right!

41:24.215 --> 41:25.216
(cheering)

41:25.216 --> 41:27.052
>> SINGER: * So be who you truly

41:27.052 --> 41:31.056
are... *

41:31.056 --> 41:32.157
>> CAITLYN: Group hug!

41:32.157 --> 41:32.958
Group hug!

41:32.958 --> 41:34.092
(laughter)

41:34.092 --> 41:35.360
>> CAITLYN: Just the gals.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.328
>> GIRL: Thank you.

41:50.576 --> 41:51.577
>> CAITLYN: Little Caitlyn's out

41:51.577 --> 41:52.578
into the world.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.012
>> CANDIS: Yay! Welcome!

41:54.012 --> 41:54.846
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

41:54.846 --> 41:55.881
Right now, every day's a new

41:55.881 --> 41:57.583
adventure.

41:58.584 --> 41:59.384
Road trip?!

41:59.384 --> 42:00.018
>> WOMAN: How do we sneak you

42:00.018 --> 42:00.952
out of here?

42:00.952 --> 42:01.820
>> CAITLYN: In a trunk.

42:01.820 --> 42:02.788
(laughing)

42:02.788 --> 42:03.354
>> CAITLYN: What happens at

42:03.354 --> 42:04.022
a slumber party?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.256
>> WOMAN 2: You pillow fight,

42:05.256 --> 42:06.124
you tell ghost stories...

42:06.124 --> 42:06.825
>> CAITLYN: Pillow fight?!?

42:06.825 --> 42:07.826
>> WOMAN 2: You compare your

42:07.826 --> 42:08.760
boob sizes...

42:08.760 --> 42:10.295
(Caitlyn laughs)

42:10.295 --> 42:11.462
>> WOMAN 3: Bathing suits.

42:11.462 --> 42:12.731
You need a sexy one for Candis.

42:12.731 --> 42:13.298
>> CAITLYN: We're not going

42:13.298 --> 42:14.232
there.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.133
>> CANDIS: Would you like to go

42:15.133 --> 42:16.367
out on a date?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.636
(Caitlyn chuckles)

42:17.636 --> 42:18.770
>> CAITLYN: But because of my

42:18.770 --> 42:20.171
status, everybody is looking at

42:20.171 --> 42:22.040
me as the spokesperson for the

42:22.040 --> 42:23.441
transgender community.

42:23.441 --> 42:24.475
>> WOMAN 4: Nervous?

42:24.475 --> 42:25.410
>> CAITLYN: Off the charts.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.244
>> WOMAN 4: I'm afraid people

42:26.244 --> 42:27.112
will think it's all about makeup

42:27.112 --> 42:27.979
and hair.

42:27.979 --> 42:28.914
And yet there are all these

42:28.914 --> 42:30.048
trans women out there who are in

42:30.048 --> 42:31.182
real danger.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.150
>> WOMAN 5: I was doing

42:32.150 --> 42:33.084
sex work.

42:33.084 --> 42:34.352
>> MAN: I was so suicidal for so

42:34.352 --> 42:35.386
much of my life.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.354
>> WOMAN 6: I got stabbed here

42:36.354 --> 42:37.288
in the chest.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.456
>> WOMAN 7: Oh, my God.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.958
>> CAITLYN: I'm thinking about

42:39.958 --> 42:41.092
my family, and I'm thinking

42:41.092 --> 42:42.260
about all this kind of stuff,

42:42.260 --> 42:44.229
and I'm struggling with it.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.997
Khloe's upset.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.132
She didn't like the

42:47.132 --> 42:48.299
Vanity Fair article...

42:48.299 --> 42:49.234
>> RONDA: Well, you better put

42:49.234 --> 42:50.235
your armor on, and your helmets,

42:50.235 --> 42:51.236
and get ready.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.337
>> KIM: You look amazing;

42:52.337 --> 42:53.538
it's your time; but you don't

42:53.538 --> 42:55.306
have to bash us on your way up.

42:55.306 --> 42:56.875
>> CAITLYN: I don't want to hurt

42:56.875 --> 42:58.376
my kids.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.678
The guys are tougher.

42:59.678 --> 43:01.179
They want me to be the old

43:01.179 --> 43:02.447
Bruce.

43:02.447 --> 43:03.815
>> SCOTT: It's gonna take some

43:03.815 --> 43:04.850
getting used to, I think, for

43:04.850 --> 43:05.817
everybody.

43:05.817 --> 43:06.718
>> WOMAN 8: I thought of it as

43:06.718 --> 43:07.686
my great curse to be trans.

43:07.686 --> 43:08.820
Now I think of it as my great

43:08.820 --> 43:10.221
gift.

43:10.221 --> 43:11.957
>> CAITLYN: What I'm hoping for

43:11.957 --> 43:13.224
is that the world is gonna

43:13.224 --> 43:14.660
follow along with me and we can

43:14.660 --> 43:15.827
learn together.

43:15.827 --> 43:16.762
>> WOMAN 7: Stop looking on the

43:16.762 --> 43:17.663
outside and start looking on the

43:17.663 --> 43:18.730
inside.

43:18.730 --> 43:19.731
We want to be just normal

43:19.731 --> 43:21.066
people.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.433
>> MAN 2: If you have a

43:22.433 --> 43:23.669
transgender kid, you are living

43:23.669 --> 43:24.970
with a unicorn, an amazing human

43:24.970 --> 43:26.672
being.

43:26.672 --> 43:27.939
>> CAITLYN: We're all beautiful!

43:27.939 --> 43:30.676
