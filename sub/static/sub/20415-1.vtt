02:10.497 --> 02:17.302
Dan: <i> Mission statement</i>
<i> for safari as a way of life.</i>

02:17.304 --> 02:18.837
<i> I want to see and do</i>
<i> so many things.</i>

02:18.839 --> 02:24.176
<i> I want this road to end</i>
<i> so that I can start.</i>

02:24.178 --> 02:27.279
<i> The only problem is,</i>
<i> where do I start?</i>

02:27.281 --> 02:31.283
<i> Where...Do...I...Start?</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:33.485
<i> Where do I start?</i>
<i> Where do I start?</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:34.920
<i> Where do I start?</i>

02:59.313 --> 03:01.346
What's so funny?

03:09.222 --> 03:12.191
Okay. All right.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.961
Beautiful.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.532
There we go.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.235
One, two, three.

03:40.787 --> 03:44.423
<i> Mission statement</i>
<i> for safari as a way of life.</i>

03:46.226 --> 03:48.460
<i> To explore the unknown</i>
<i> and the familiar,</i>

03:48.462 --> 03:49.962
<i> the distant and near,</i>

03:49.964 --> 03:53.599
<i> and to record in detail</i>
<i> with the eyes of a child</i>

03:53.601 --> 03:56.568
<i> any evidence of beauty...</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.904
<i> Of the flesh or--</i>
<i> or otherwise,</i>

03:58.906 --> 04:03.008
<i> uh, horror, irony,</i>
<i> traces of utopia or hell.</i>

04:03.010 --> 04:05.811
<i> Look for solutions,</i>
<i> not problems,</i>

04:05.813 --> 04:09.514
<i> and search for clean water</i>
<i> in a swamp.</i>

04:09.516 --> 04:12.251
<i> Select your team with care,</i>

04:12.253 --> 04:14.920
<i> but when in doubt,</i>
<i> take on some new crew</i>

04:14.922 --> 04:16.387
<i> and give them a chance.</i>

04:16.390 --> 04:18.023
<i> Avoid at all costs</i>

04:18.024 --> 04:21.760
<i> fluctuations of sincerity</i>
<i> with your best people.</i>

04:27.533 --> 04:29.935
<i> The hitchhiker's guide</i>
<i> to Southern Africa.</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:32.471
<i> Up to town, down for local.</i>

04:32.473 --> 04:36.275
<i> Diepsloot, orange grove,</i>
<i> Jersey,</i>

04:36.277 --> 04:38.777
<i> or just moving on.</i>

04:45.552 --> 04:47.319
Doing good.
How you doing?

05:00.800 --> 05:01.900
That's my sister.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.769
That's my sister.
No, no, no.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.676
Ah, you park in the back
with my daughter.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.078
Thank you.
Come on.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.713
Godspeed.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.415
I'll tell you
what the answer is.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.916
Purely mathematical.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.319
Every white man has got
to kill nine black guys.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.520
That's the solution.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.021
The mathematical solution?

05:23.023 --> 05:25.023
Yeah. Go into soweto,
level it.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.591
Don't stop halfway.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.360
I mean, America
killed the Indians.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.528
Australia killed
the aborigines.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.096
It's a point
of national pride.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.598
Anyone who tells you different
is a bloody hypocrite.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.601
Dan: <i> My first real Nazi.</i>

05:36.603 --> 05:40.105
Erik, there's a joker
who wants to know

05:40.107 --> 05:41.740
if we can accommodate him
for the night.

05:43.977 --> 05:47.079
Come, bud.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.716
Curiosity killed the cat.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.123
Dan: <i> What were you</i>
<i> charged with, sir?</i>

05:58.125 --> 06:02.594
<i> The usual: 3,000 volts.</i>

06:05.898 --> 06:08.600
Would you like the light
left on or off?

06:08.602 --> 06:11.103
On, please.
I'll do some reading.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.549
Dan: <i> Do unto others</i>
<i> before they do unto you.</i>

06:26.520 --> 06:29.154
<i> That statement will be</i>
<i> beaten into some of you.</i>

06:30.524 --> 06:33.658
Yes for peace!
Yes for peace!

06:33.660 --> 06:36.094
Yes for peace!
Yes for peace!

06:36.096 --> 06:38.897
Yes for peace!
Yes for peace!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.533
Yes for peace!
Yes for peace!

06:41.535 --> 06:44.436
Yes for peace!
Yes for peace!

06:55.982 --> 06:57.048
Whoo!

07:13.132 --> 07:14.699
Hey, mum.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.802
Oh, my sweetheart!

07:16.804 --> 07:20.639
It's so wonderful,
so wonderful.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.542
I am so sorry
i can't stay tonight.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.043
Oh, no.
What about the dinner?

07:25.045 --> 07:28.113
You know that's more
your father's crowd than mine.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.881
But I will
make it up to you.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.783
I promise, okay?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.118
Yeah.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.954
Love you very much.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.057
Congratulations.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.892
Fantastic.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.503
She's living
in the guest house.

07:51.505 --> 07:55.140
At least until
she leaves for good.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.708
Where will she go?

07:56.710 --> 08:00.512
London. Far.

08:00.514 --> 08:05.083
She'll miss
the special brownies.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.185
How special?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.087
Special enough
to make you forget

08:09.089 --> 08:11.089
about her leaving
for tonight.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.533
This is up north
near turkana.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.703
Yeah, these are some
of my samburu friends,

08:24.705 --> 08:26.571
and they had actually told me
that they'd let me come back

08:26.573 --> 08:27.906
for their circumcision
and shoot that.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.709
I thought maybe I could
do that for the service.

08:30.711 --> 08:35.046
Um, that's my sister Amy
and a cheetah.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.918
Oh, sorry. Some of the guys
who work carving statues.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.052
Do you pose them?

08:41.054 --> 08:44.188
Just a bit,
just for the light.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.690
Reporter on TV;
<i> ...Continues unabated.</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:47.259
<i> Earlier predictions</i>
<i> of a disaster</i>

08:47.261 --> 08:49.227
<i> are now a grim reality</i>

08:49.229 --> 08:52.030
<i> unless humanitarian relief</i>
<i> efforts are stepped up.</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:54.533
There are some very nice
images. Personal.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.067
Mm.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.069
Maybe more personal
than journalistic.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.804
Well, what about these?

08:59.806 --> 09:02.073
So this is kipinget.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.742
She used to live in a <i> boma,</i>

09:03.744 --> 09:05.577
and the government moved them
to this settlement

09:05.579 --> 09:06.811
and outlawed their
traditional cattle raids--

09:06.813 --> 09:08.747
there's never
a boring story.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.549
Only a boring
correspondent.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.784
You came here looking
for the dream job.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.252
I'm afraid
i can't give it to you.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.054
I'll tell you
what you want to do.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.256
You want to get out there
in the real world

09:18.258 --> 09:20.892
where there's warm beer
and smelly pussy.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.862
Then bring me back
some real stories.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.096
What'd he say?

09:25.098 --> 09:28.099
He says we need smelly
beer and warm pussy.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.201
Or was it
the other way around?

09:30.203 --> 09:33.171
<i> Food and medicine</i>
<i> are in short supply.</i>

09:33.173 --> 09:36.074
<i> With great need for refugee</i>
<i> support contributions...</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:37.642
Now, something should
be done about that.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.711
<i> So far,</i>
<i> the response has been slow.</i>

09:50.890 --> 09:52.624
Eiji. It's Dan.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.925
I've been thinking
about your talent

09:53.927 --> 09:56.061
for fleecing the defenseless
and the gullible.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.762
Do you own a suit?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.631
For lunch, I brought...

09:59.633 --> 10:01.232
To support
the Mozambique refugees.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.867
It's for a good cause,
people.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.136
Amy? How do you say
hello in Swedish?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.105
Marte's Norwegian, Dan.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.107
Hi, marte. It's Dan.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.675
We're planning a trip
taking money

10:10.677 --> 10:12.143
to the refugees
in Mozambique.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.311
Elly, it's Dan eldon.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.980
Yeah, well, there
are cheap flights,

10:14.982 --> 10:17.716
so New York, London,
Kenyan airways to Nairobi,

10:17.718 --> 10:20.185
then three weeks of terrible
roads through three countries.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.286
Great.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.254
My lady, big smile
for Mozambique!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.723
All right.
Thanks, ma'am.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.658
$100 for one tee-shirt.
Thank you very much.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.926
Right. Who's next?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.829
Guys, it's 100 shillings
for the plain

10:30.831 --> 10:32.964
and two for the custom,
including artist's signature.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.033
It's all for
a good cause. 80.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.167
Hey, thanks, Dan.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.369
How do we know
this isn't going

10:37.371 --> 10:38.637
straight into the
eldon tusker beer fund

10:38.639 --> 10:39.904
instead of the refugees?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.339
Because we'll be
taking it personally.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.375
- In that?
- That is a she.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.776
It's deziree.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.645
So how you gonna
get to the camps?

10:46.647 --> 10:49.714
Uh, we're just gonna aim
in their general direction.

10:49.716 --> 10:52.117
Explore.
Explore or get lost?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.118
Getting lost would mean
we knew where we were
heading

10:53.120 --> 10:54.119
in the first place.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.320
Which we don't.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.422
I've convinced marte
to be navigator.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.157
So you have, lengai.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.358
Elly is our cook.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.093
Eiji's the
videographer/accountant,

11:02.095 --> 11:03.328
and Amy's our driver.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.863
Whoa, no.
I'm not driving.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.332
And Amy's come up
with a name, right, mutz?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.967
"Deziree sex safaris"?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.102
I think it'll work.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.871
We're gonna need
a mechanic.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.739
Right. Guys, dig deep
for Mozambique.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.241
All right, next.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.876
Thank you very much.
Next. Let's go.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.690
White men can't dance.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.439
Who's that?

11:47.441 --> 11:48.740
Who?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.209
Her.
Oh, the Princess.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.244
She was in
the international school

11:53.246 --> 11:55.113
with the rest of us
in my class.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.916
You know, saba,
with the glasses.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.030
Didn't recognize you without
the coke-bottle glasses.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.766
I can wear them for you
if it helps.

12:14.768 --> 12:15.867
It would actually, yeah.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.776
How'd you learn
to do that?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.945
Do what?

12:26.947 --> 12:29.814
The speed.
The speed is not human.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.853
Hold on.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.788
Guys? Guys?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.358
Stop! Stop! Stop!

12:41.428 --> 12:43.094
Okay, okay, okay.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.362
Can you start slowly -

12:44.364 --> 12:48.366
like dragging out of bed -

12:48.368 --> 12:51.169
then speed up fast? Okay?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.872
Yeah?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.273
Ah, Swahili?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.075
Little bit, yeah.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.110
The floor is yours.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.590
Whoo!
Well, all right!

14:26.432 --> 14:28.099
Where shall we go?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.401
Nowhere.
I have to go home.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.469
I'll take you home.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.471
No. I have a driver.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.074
You should come with us.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.508
Come with you where?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.110
On safari...

14:39.112 --> 14:40.311
To the camps.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.412
Not a chance.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.881
How can you say that?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.048
It's for a good cause.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.984
You don't know my father.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.586
Yeah, well, exactly.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.227
She never sits down.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.897
Dan, why don't you tell
my father about your travels?

14:58.899 --> 15:01.900
Well, every school break,
i try and go somewhere.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.569
So Moscow, New York, Tokyo.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.971
Father: Hmm.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.340
And, uh,
your parents,

15:09.342 --> 15:11.976
do they fund
your adventures?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.212
No, no. I earn my own way.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.948
I spend nothing.
I don't eat much.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.951
Mm, last year,
i was in India

15:19.953 --> 15:22.353
selling jewelry
and taking photographs.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.488
Dan has been
to 46 countries.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.089
Yes, but India.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.459
Who in god's name would
want to go to India?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.395
Terribly poor.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.131
A little bit like the slums
here in Nairobi.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.632
You've been there,
haven't you, sir?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.267
Tell me, young man,

15:36.269 --> 15:39.971
what you plan to do
when you finish
taking photos?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.472
I'm not planning
to finish, sir.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.341
Actually, perhaps
we could have a meeting.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.310
Discuss my ideas.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.647
Like I was saying, I do
believe Robert mugabe

15:49.649 --> 15:51.316
is an exceptional
politician.

16:18.143 --> 16:22.413
Dan: <i> You are so beautiful.</i>
<i> You are so beautiful.</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:27.518
<i> I love the way you look,</i>
<i> the way you talk,</i>

16:27.520 --> 16:28.686
<i> the way you are.</i>

16:28.688 --> 16:30.188
<i> Your eyes, your shoes,</i>

16:30.190 --> 16:31.990
<i> your funny earring,</i>
<i> your nose.</i>

16:31.992 --> 16:33.725
<i> Your knees, your teeth.</i>

16:33.727 --> 16:36.361
Saba, what is it?
Saba, have you?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.429
You made a decision yet,
darling?

16:38.431 --> 16:39.430
Pardon?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.466
Decision about university.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.301
Oh, yes.
Cambridge law, I think,

16:43.303 --> 16:45.536
same as daddy,
come September.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.005
That's my girl.
That's my girl.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.639
Woman: Impressive.
Impressive.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.707
Just like daddy.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.611
Benefits of an
English education.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.656
Now, there are seven of you.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.060
Small- to average-sized
African family.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.496
Now you've just been forced
to flee your homeland

17:11.498 --> 17:12.797
because of a disaster.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.233
Not a natural disaster,
but a manmade one

17:16.236 --> 17:19.203
which has seen your country
go down the tubes.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.204
You are a family
of refugees,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.374
and this is all
you're going to eat...

17:26.045 --> 17:27.078
On a good day.

17:38.590 --> 17:42.326
I've got this one.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.429
Pass me
that sleeping bag, yeah?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.830
Wait. Here.
Hey, guys!

17:45.832 --> 17:50.201
We raised 75,800
Kenyan shillings.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.637
So that's about
$12,000.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.472
Great.
Good job, everybody.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.491
What, your dad's
big wet corporate kiss?

18:13.493 --> 18:17.295
$17,000!

18:18.798 --> 18:20.198
Yeah!

18:20.200 --> 18:22.233
Yes!

18:22.235 --> 18:24.268
Yeah! Whoo!

18:31.510 --> 18:32.677
Kipinget.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.823
Thanks for the lift, Dan.
Have a good one.

18:45.825 --> 18:50.128
Take care, vj.
I'll see you soon. Yeah.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.362
It's Mozambique or bust!

18:51.364 --> 18:52.630
Mozambique or bust.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.232
Whoo!
Whoo!

19:09.915 --> 19:11.716
I'm going to be sick.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.451
I'm going to be sick.
- Oh, no, not again!

19:13.453 --> 19:15.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.361
Why did you invite her, Dan?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.229
She can't hack the bush.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.664
She's all right.
She'll be fine.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.566
Oh, we're
overheating again.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.667
Get some water ready.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.669
Right. In the back.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.671
You know, how many times
can a human being puke

19:33.673 --> 19:35.273
in a single day?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.441
I mean, honestly, we should
just leave her out here.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.609
You know, make
a sacrifice of her.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.877
This is Africa.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.945
Rich, it's not that bad.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.280
Really,
it could be worse.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.848
Whoa!
Oh!

19:47.953 --> 19:51.322
One, two, three.
Augh!

19:52.558 --> 19:54.659
Oh, god.
Make sure
he's steering.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.961
It's all right, saba.
Don't worry about it.

19:58.897 --> 19:59.964
Here we go!

20:51.450 --> 20:53.851
she had sugar sweet lips.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.292
And magical hips.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.828
Just like I fantasized.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.640
Okay.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.541
No.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.677
No. Stop!

21:19.679 --> 21:22.280
I said okay!

21:22.282 --> 21:24.749
Sorry. I thought
you were liking it.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.822
You want to be screwed, huh?

21:31.824 --> 21:34.025
No, no, no! Wait!

21:37.496 --> 21:40.064
Now you're screwed.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.658
<i> Pata potea.</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:09.493
<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>

22:09.495 --> 22:11.896
<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>

22:11.898 --> 22:13.631
Dan: <i> This rhythm</i>
<i> is more common</i>

22:13.633 --> 22:15.499
<i> than any drumbeat</i>
<i> in Africa.</i>

22:15.501 --> 22:19.537
<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>
<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>

22:19.539 --> 22:23.874
<i> In Swahili, pata potea</i>
<i> means "find one, lose one"</i>

22:23.876 --> 22:25.976
<i> because flip-flops</i>
<i> vanish just as frequently</i>

22:25.978 --> 22:27.912

22:27.914 --> 22:28.946
<i> in western culture.</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:35.453
<i> Oh, shit.</i>

22:35.455 --> 22:37.121
<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>

22:37.123 --> 22:39.457

<i> Pata potea. Pata potea.</i>

22:56.576 --> 22:58.976

23:04.583 --> 23:07.084
Rich!

23:07.086 --> 23:09.820
Don't move.
He won't see you.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.556
Don't move!

23:28.107 --> 23:29.507
No.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.553
Dan? Dan, are you okay?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.922
Dan, are you all right?

23:44.924 --> 23:47.591
That was the best!
Did you see? Did you see?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.663
Did you see?
I could smell his breath!

23:52.665 --> 23:53.731
Your legs
are bleeding.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.832
My camera!
Where's my camera?

23:54.834 --> 23:56.500
Let's find the camera!

23:56.502 --> 23:58.436
Take a photo!
Take a photo quick!

23:58.438 --> 23:59.804
No, I want to see
what I'm thinking.

23:59.806 --> 24:00.971
He's a little bit
crazy.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.441
Yeah, he is.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.298
man: Just do it!

25:38.303 --> 25:42.606
You are
so good at this.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.044
Any luck?

26:12.671 --> 26:15.072
that was beautiful,
marte.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.774
Thanks.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.270
Have you brushed
your teeth?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.806
No, mother.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.275
I'm not your mother.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.751
Hello. The natives
are friendly.

27:02.654 --> 27:03.988
It's customary.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.323
For some lucky dog maybe.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.876
I'm going to go
wash my mouth out.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.657
Come on, Amy!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

27:39.659 --> 27:40.691
Try second gear.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.060
Give it clutch.
Faster!

27:46.332 --> 27:48.866
Faster.
That's it. Faster.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.200
<i> Liberté!</i>

27:50.202 --> 27:51.335
<i> Égalité!</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:53.737
- Safari!
- Safari!

27:57.676 --> 27:59.076
Leaving Tanzania now.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.344
Get your passports out.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.680
Amy, can you grab
my passport?

28:02.682 --> 28:03.914
Move it on, move it on.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.015
Make sure you got them all.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.984
Do you want me to
take care of it?

28:06.986 --> 28:09.019
All right. So...

28:09.021 --> 28:11.789
Okay, cool.
I have this one.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.909
Welcome to Malawi, guys.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.777
Whoo!
Here we go.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.016
And now with
a breaking news story,

28:39.018 --> 28:42.419
we go to African correspondent
Dr. lengai croze.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.254
This just in!

28:44.256 --> 28:47.925
Africa's new and horrific
social health crisis.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.260
A more venomous,
more dangerous

28:50.262 --> 28:53.097
and more addictive drug
known as <i> mbewa</i>

28:53.099 --> 28:55.032
is rearing
its ratty head.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.434
Children are given small
rats to begin with,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.436
and as
the addiction grows,

28:59.438 --> 29:01.238
so does the price.
Ghastly!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.506
Those who are
selling the vermin

29:02.508 --> 29:04.942
are becoming
millionaires overnight.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.510
A shocking story,
Dr. croze.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.445
It nearly made me choke
on my shrimp salad.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.950
Our hopes and prayers
are with you.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.952
We hope to see you back
on English soil soon, sir.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.253
Thank you so much.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.041
Start at the head
and work your way up.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.043
Come on, eiji.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.945
Ah, ah, ah.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.547
Aah!
Aah!

29:43.549 --> 29:45.282
Oh!

30:12.510 --> 30:14.478
What's happening?

30:14.480 --> 30:15.913
Refugees.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.148
Look, Dan,
is it safe or what?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.383
Let's just go back
to Nairobi.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.151
No. Let's see
what's going on.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.520
What are you, man,
like a disaster tourist?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.255
We're in a war zone.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.858
That's impossible.
We're still in Malawi.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.894
Mozambique's
another 50k.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.265
Hey, hey, white boy,
what are you doing?

31:08.267 --> 31:09.600
Hey, man, what
are you doing here?

31:09.602 --> 31:12.002
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.638
I didn't do anything!
Hey, easy, man!

31:16.942 --> 31:19.076
Let that go!

31:19.078 --> 31:20.444
Easy, mate.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.546
Can you close the door please?

31:24.415 --> 31:26.550
Daniel. Dan!

31:26.552 --> 31:30.087
Take it! Take it!
Take it! Take it!

31:30.089 --> 31:31.555
Take the film!
Take the film!

31:33.091 --> 31:34.424
Close the door!

31:34.426 --> 31:37.461
Thank you.
All right, all right!

31:37.463 --> 31:39.062
Dan, what were you thinking?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.631
It was just a photo!

31:40.633 --> 31:42.132
Get out of the way!

32:00.151 --> 32:02.986
Okay, the camp's
beyond the checkpoints.

32:02.988 --> 32:04.321
Follow the escort
in the morning,

32:04.323 --> 32:05.489
make the donation,

32:05.491 --> 32:08.058
paperwork,
and that's it.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.461
Uh, Dan?

32:13.097 --> 32:15.098
We want to leave now.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.601
We've talked about it,

32:17.603 --> 32:19.937
and we all agree.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.941
Who agrees?

32:23.943 --> 32:26.076
Rich, you wanna come,
right?

32:27.512 --> 32:28.946
Saba?

32:32.250 --> 32:34.017
Ames?

32:34.019 --> 32:37.054
I don't think that you
can decide for them...

32:37.056 --> 32:38.055
Or me.

32:41.159 --> 32:45.062
Okay. Question one:

32:45.064 --> 32:47.531
Hands up all those who
were expecting a vacation.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.732
Dan--
okay, question two:

32:48.734 --> 32:50.400
If your hand's not up,

32:50.402 --> 32:51.735
please tell me why you came
in the first place!

32:51.737 --> 32:53.603
Dan, we all came
for the right reasons,

32:53.605 --> 32:55.505
but there is a limit
to what we can do here.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.107
If we all came
for the right reasons

32:57.109 --> 32:59.109
and we've accomplished
absolutely nothing,

32:59.111 --> 33:01.311
then question three:
How can you quit?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.347
Don't be such
an asshole!
She's too young
for you, rich!

33:03.349 --> 33:04.648
It's not like that!
That's enough.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.649
We're only telling you this

33:05.651 --> 33:06.984
because we care about you.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.285
Let's just calm down
and listen--

33:08.287 --> 33:09.753
what are we doing
if we're not safe?

33:09.755 --> 33:11.154
We can lose you.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.756
And four: Who thinks
they can leave now

33:12.758 --> 33:14.992
when there's a curfew
on the road?

33:14.994 --> 33:16.326
Or would you rather risk
getting arrested

33:16.328 --> 33:18.195
and locked up
eating barbecue rats?

33:38.149 --> 33:40.717
Dan: <i> Week three,</i>
<i> waiting for the army escort</i>

33:40.719 --> 33:42.552
<i> through the tete corridor.</i>

33:42.554 --> 33:46.590
<i> Sniper fire,</i>
<i> bing, bing, bing.</i>

33:46.592 --> 33:49.026
<i> Rebel rocket, boom, boom.</i>

33:49.028 --> 33:53.263
<i> En route to the refugees</i>
<i> of a marxist utopia.</i>

34:03.508 --> 34:05.509
Why would the south
African government

34:05.511 --> 34:07.177
fund the Mozambique
rebels?

34:07.179 --> 34:08.245
Don't they have
their own problems?

34:08.246 --> 34:10.047
That is the point, see.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.782
A war next door
creates a diversion

34:11.784 --> 34:14.284
from their own problems
over apartheid.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.286
Keeps it out
of the headlines.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.356
Now we have one million
people in Malawi

34:19.358 --> 34:20.456
with nothing to live on.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.411
Oh, wow.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.406
Hi.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.349
Hello. Hello.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.350
Hello.

35:20.352 --> 35:23.220
Hey.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.122
Hi.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.223
Welcome.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.361
All right, so you fill it
all the way to the top?

36:04.363 --> 36:05.729
Yeah? All right, good.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.797
Okay.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.399
Now this
goes on my head?

36:09.401 --> 36:10.867
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.303
All right, all right.
Stay right there.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.574
All right?

36:17.576 --> 36:19.276
Look!

36:45.504 --> 36:47.904
Think that might be it,
man. Fire it up.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.239
Give it a try.
Give it a try.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.544
And you can zoom in
and mark it.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.814
Yeah, yeah, there.
There. Yeah, yeah.

37:01.419 --> 37:02.586
All right.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.387
Hello.
Hello.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.989
Yes.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.292
He's so impressed.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.864
Did you draw this?

37:47.866 --> 37:49.399
Yes.

37:54.406 --> 37:57.741
They told me
the rebels set fire
to his parents' house

37:57.743 --> 37:58.842
and they were burned
to death.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.943
More coming every day.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.280
Getting reports
of mass killings.

38:03.282 --> 38:06.383
Rape is common,
women and girls,

38:06.385 --> 38:08.018
especially with the distances
they have to walk

38:08.020 --> 38:09.552
to get water and firewood.

38:09.554 --> 38:10.887
How much is a well?

38:10.889 --> 38:14.324
About $1,500
to supply 5,000 people.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.926
That's it? Wow.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.366
Look, just make sure
it's all here, eiji.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.734
- Yep.
- This is fifties.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.704
- Yeah, 50.
- 50.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.939
And here's tens.
All of it.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.711
Make it look good.

38:36.415 --> 38:39.482
There you go. Food,
medicine, blankets.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.750
Short term,
at least.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.052
It's beautiful, man.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.554
Nice one, man!

38:44.556 --> 38:46.956
It's cool, right?

40:45.042 --> 40:47.577
Ben: What if it
didn't end here?

40:47.579 --> 40:48.945
What if what?

40:48.947 --> 40:51.614
Safari, man.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.150
Safari
as a way of life.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.687
I'd love
to come with you.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.222
So do it.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.591
Lengs, we'll go
to the end of Africa

41:01.593 --> 41:03.026
till there's no more
Africa to conquer.

41:03.028 --> 41:06.696
I'd love to,
but I can't.

41:09.967 --> 41:13.002
I'll get the school
thing over with first.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.838
And then?

41:14.840 --> 41:17.807
And then...

41:17.809 --> 41:20.210
The sky's the limit.

41:39.663 --> 41:42.131
It's weird.
I feel like this trip
has just started.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.000
So what are you saying?

41:44.002 --> 41:46.002
No, I was looking at
the line on the map.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.771
It just kind of
stops short.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.907
And what am i
going to tell them, huh?

41:50.909 --> 41:52.742
What about mom's
going away party?

41:52.744 --> 41:54.077
I'll try and make it.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.645
What about money?

41:55.647 --> 41:58.548
What are you gonna live on,
good looks and charm?

41:58.550 --> 41:59.949
Oh, no.
You're totally right.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.118
I'm gonna die of hunger.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.120
I am.
Amy, I'm gonna die--

42:04.122 --> 42:05.588
I need you
to help me! Amy!

42:13.697 --> 42:16.065
So what's next?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.967
A job, maybe.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.103
The Princess...

42:20.105 --> 42:21.170
At work.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.906
Just for the rest
of the year.

42:22.908 --> 42:27.810
Not sure I know,
to tell the truth.

42:31.649 --> 42:34.117
Listen,
i didn't mean to, um...

42:36.654 --> 42:39.589
If I crossed a line...

42:39.591 --> 42:41.891
It's okay.

42:43.627 --> 42:45.061
Okay.

42:48.799 --> 42:49.999
I'll see you very soon.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.000
Good on, man.
Very soon.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.136
Yeah, man, very soon.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.779
I'm thinking
of trying to pull off
a new well for them.

43:02.781 --> 43:04.647
That's brilliant.

43:15.626 --> 43:18.127
Bye. Bye.<i> Ciao.</i>

43:18.129 --> 43:19.262
Goodbye!

43:19.264 --> 43:21.164
No, no, no.
Never goodbye.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.633
It's... 
Goodbye until I see you again.

43:23.635 --> 43:25.101
Goodbye until
i see you again.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.804
How will you get
to where you're going?

43:31.008 --> 43:33.309
Children: Bye!

43:33.311 --> 43:36.813
Bye!

43:49.360 --> 43:51.894
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

43:51.896 --> 43:54.697
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

43:54.699 --> 43:57.200
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.402
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.973
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.776
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:06.778 --> 44:09.345
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:09.347 --> 44:12.081
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.717
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:14.719 --> 44:15.985
Yes for peace.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.122
"Yes for peace."
What's it about?

44:19.124 --> 44:23.993
The whites are voting
to end apartheid or not.

44:23.995 --> 44:27.163
Who are you with,
associated press?

44:27.165 --> 44:28.931
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:28.933 --> 44:32.669
today will be written up
in our history

44:32.671 --> 44:37.373
as one of the most fundamental
turning point days

44:37.375 --> 44:39.442
in the history
of South Africa.

44:39.444 --> 44:44.781
Today we have closed
the book on apartheid,

44:44.783 --> 44:47.283
and that chapter
is finally closed.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.896
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

44:59.898 --> 45:03.166
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:03.168 --> 45:05.935
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:05.937 --> 45:07.203
Yes for peace.

45:07.205 --> 45:10.139
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:10.141 --> 45:12.842
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:12.844 --> 45:15.211
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.114
No! No! Shit!

45:18.116 --> 45:20.717
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:20.719 --> 45:23.486
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:23.488 --> 45:26.089
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:26.091 --> 45:28.958
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.728
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:31.730 --> 45:35.164
Yes for peace.
Yes for peace.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.799
I'm calling
from South Africa.

45:36.801 --> 45:38.735
Yeah, just put me
through to Marty.

45:38.737 --> 45:40.036
How long have you
been in joburg?

45:40.038 --> 45:42.105
This time?
A couple of days.

45:42.107 --> 45:43.106
I'm with reuters.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.407
Yeah, I'll hold.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.876
Peterson's with
Christian science monitor.

45:46.878 --> 45:47.977
You a photographer, man?

45:47.979 --> 45:50.046
Yeah.

45:50.048 --> 45:52.915
He's more free
than freelance
is my impression.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.117
Hey, hey, Marty?

45:58.857 --> 46:00.223
you're gonna get us
thrown out again, man.

46:00.225 --> 46:01.357
Dan! That's Dan!

46:01.359 --> 46:02.425
How did you get started?

46:02.427 --> 46:04.293
- Over and out.
- O'Reilly!

46:04.295 --> 46:06.829
A friend of mine
was with the
Philadelphia enquirer.

46:06.831 --> 46:09.899
I went with him
to El Salvador
as a bag carrier.

46:09.901 --> 46:11.434
A bag carrier?

46:11.436 --> 46:12.869
Yeah. It's called learning
on the job, interning...

46:12.871 --> 46:14.237
Oh, a low ceiling here.
White slavery.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.872
I had no idea what
i was getting into.

46:15.874 --> 46:18.074
Completely stupid.

46:18.076 --> 46:21.844
I got shot at,
almost arrested,

46:21.846 --> 46:23.946
and nearly passed out
with fear.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.948
Took hundreds
of photos

46:25.950 --> 46:28.951
and managed to sell two
for 50 bucks.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.153
Never published.

46:30.155 --> 46:32.488
Definitely a mistake.

46:32.490 --> 46:35.158
O'Reilly, you're sleeping
with me tonight, man.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.194
You can be the big spoon.
Come on, let's go.

46:38.196 --> 46:41.164
We're flying out
from the airport
tomorrow at dawn.

46:41.166 --> 46:44.801
O'Reilly says he heard about
a situation in mogadishu.

46:44.803 --> 46:46.335
See you around, Dan.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.070
Good to meet you, Dan.

46:48.072 --> 46:49.572
I could be
your bag carrier.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.975
Sorry. No tourists allowed.

47:27.911 --> 47:31.214
Hey, Duffy,
grease a little palm.

47:31.216 --> 47:34.250
Stack our odds there'll
be a return flight.

47:43.994 --> 47:45.127
Holy shit.

47:48.599 --> 47:50.566
What you got there, Dan?

47:50.568 --> 47:53.436
A thesaurus.

47:53.438 --> 47:55.271
Hey, Scott.
Hey, Dan.

47:55.273 --> 47:56.339
How's it going?
Good. How you doing?

47:56.341 --> 47:57.340
Steve O'Reilly.

47:57.342 --> 48:00.209
Yeah. Dan.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.611
The somalis were nomads

48:01.613 --> 48:04.347
in a country that
has no water, no soil.

48:04.349 --> 48:08.117
It's hot enough to fry
an egg on a camel's ass.

48:08.119 --> 48:09.552
Their clans
have been fighting

48:09.554 --> 48:11.020
since the beginning
of time,

48:11.022 --> 48:13.556
first with Spears,
then with Russian guns,

48:13.558 --> 48:15.258
and now with guns
from the Americans,

48:15.260 --> 48:18.527
depending on who
was friends with who
in cold war times.

48:18.529 --> 48:20.930
The somalis weren't fussy
so long as the guns
kept coming

48:20.932 --> 48:23.366
and they could
turn them on their
ancient enemies.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.468
Tough buggers.
Survivors.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.103
That's what
i love about them.

48:27.105 --> 48:29.405
It's outrageous.
Men in skirts

48:29.407 --> 48:31.374
killing each other over
clan differences, huh?

48:31.376 --> 48:33.109
Barbaric.

48:33.111 --> 48:36.412
Add bagpipes and a golf course,
shaffi, it's Scotland.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.915
Ha! Shut up!

48:46.423 --> 48:48.190
Dan, Dan, no.

48:48.192 --> 48:50.326
Don't show your camera,
and don't show fear.

48:50.328 --> 48:53.095
You listen to me
like I was your father,
understand?

48:53.097 --> 48:54.263
Yes,<i> babuji.</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:56.632
I said <i> like </i>
i was your father.

49:07.344 --> 49:10.046
Hey. Hey!

49:10.048 --> 49:11.714
Welcome to Somalia.

49:11.716 --> 49:14.216
Bloody trouble
with the aid business

49:14.218 --> 49:15.518
is it gives them
something to loot.

49:25.128 --> 49:26.696
Cigarette.
Got a cigarette?

49:44.214 --> 49:47.450
Take bag. The bag.

50:19.016 --> 50:21.350
You said don't show fear.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.252
There are limits.

51:13.370 --> 51:16.639
Save your film.
No one will print it.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.774
Tough to ignore,
though, if they did.

51:39.329 --> 51:42.298
He's rahanwein.
A farmer clan.

51:42.300 --> 51:45.101
These guards
are habre gedir.

51:45.103 --> 51:46.569
They won't touch him.

52:22.239 --> 52:24.673
Are you ready
for this, Dan?

53:13.958 --> 53:17.860
Dan? Here.

53:17.862 --> 53:20.696
Chew enough and it'll numb
your nuts if nothing else.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.826
Duff: Coming through.
Coming through.

53:55.999 --> 53:58.400
Another nice, easy day
at the office, eh?

53:58.402 --> 54:00.636
Yesterday I tried
to get a supply vehicle

54:00.638 --> 54:02.738
to a feed center
across town.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.974
The driver was shot dead
and it was looted,

54:04.976 --> 54:06.475
lock, stock,
and bloody barrel.

54:06.477 --> 54:07.943
Jesus.

54:07.945 --> 54:10.613
The clans are holding
everyone to ransom.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.948
What's your estimate, sue?

54:12.950 --> 54:14.783
Two, three million.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.819
They're arriving
in thousands every day,

54:16.821 --> 54:18.988
and they're all
going to die.

54:34.005 --> 54:36.672
Relax, Dan.
It's crowd control.

55:52.482 --> 55:55.551
O'Reilly:
The belly of the beast.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.387
War, famine,

55:58.389 --> 56:00.489
the black heart.

56:00.491 --> 56:04.593
Once you've seen into
the belly of the beast,

56:04.595 --> 56:06.895
you can't help
going back for more.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.630
What do you mean?

56:08.632 --> 56:11.633
Wars are funny
like that.

56:11.635 --> 56:14.737
I've been
to five or six now.

56:14.739 --> 56:17.639
Each time I come, i
swear it'll be the last.

56:17.641 --> 56:20.576
But there's
always something

56:20.578 --> 56:22.378
that forces you deeper,

56:22.380 --> 56:23.879
further in search
of whatever it is

56:23.881 --> 56:25.614
you believe
will be the truth,

56:25.616 --> 56:27.983
an unspeakable act
of evil or horror

56:27.985 --> 56:29.952
that you can take back
to the real world...

56:32.122 --> 56:34.723
And say, there it is.

56:34.725 --> 56:36.592
I found it.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.799
But then you realize there's
always something else...

56:45.535 --> 56:47.836
And it always
brings you back.

57:05.722 --> 57:08.490
Perhaps let's put them up
a bit higher.

57:09.859 --> 57:11.693
Oi. Okay.

57:13.463 --> 57:15.731
Got it?

57:15.733 --> 57:16.765
Dan!

57:18.468 --> 57:19.635
Aah!

57:19.637 --> 57:24.606
My boy! Hello!

57:24.608 --> 57:28.010
Somalia. For how long?

57:28.012 --> 57:30.612
Two days.
Oh, you have no idea.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.648
I mean, nobody does.
The place, it's in chaos.

57:32.650 --> 57:35.484
There's people starving
to death, and nobody knows.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.655
I'm sorry. I'm still--
still absorbing it, you know.

57:39.657 --> 57:41.557
I'm still just not sure

57:41.559 --> 57:43.826
what to do with
these things in my head.

57:43.828 --> 57:46.728
Well, there's a civil war
there, darling.

57:46.730 --> 57:48.030
You don't want to just
go and throw yourself

57:48.032 --> 57:49.097
into something like that.

57:49.099 --> 57:50.833
I was with
other journalists.

57:50.835 --> 57:53.902
Journalists who are probably
a lot more experienced than you.

57:53.904 --> 57:55.737
Mom, I'm 21, okay?

57:55.739 --> 57:57.072
Some them
are 28, 29.

57:57.074 --> 57:58.207
They all started
somewhere.

57:58.209 --> 58:00.142
It's still too crazy, Dan.

58:00.144 --> 58:02.711
Exactly. And, look,
you've already been there.

58:02.713 --> 58:04.146
You've done it.
You've had the adventure.

58:04.148 --> 58:06.248
I'm so glad you're home.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.916
Take a shower.
I'm gonna feed you.

58:10.487 --> 58:14.122
It won't be a real home
for much longer, will it?

58:20.797 --> 58:22.798
Open this one.

58:25.702 --> 58:28.704
Okay, you're
going to love this.

58:29.939 --> 58:32.808
<i> Karibu, habari.</i>
<i> Asante.</i>

58:32.810 --> 58:36.111
Everyone, this is Abdul.
Abdul, this is everybody.

58:37.581 --> 58:39.982
Make way
for the band, please.

58:39.984 --> 58:41.750
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

58:41.752 --> 58:47.523
Hey, I met him
at the Maasai market
yesterday, okay?

58:47.525 --> 58:48.824
I think he brought
some friends.

58:48.826 --> 58:49.892
What was I gonna do?

58:49.894 --> 58:51.760
He's living
out of his car.

58:51.762 --> 58:52.895
I couldn't do nothing.

58:52.897 --> 58:54.696
He brought how many
friends exactly?

58:54.698 --> 58:58.567
Yes, well, I love
that charitable side
of you, Mike.

58:58.569 --> 59:02.170
We need music, he needs
a place to play music,

59:02.172 --> 59:03.939
and so...
I said all right.

59:03.941 --> 59:06.708
It's perfect. Perfect,
perfect, perfect!

59:06.710 --> 59:09.311
Yes! Abdul and the gang!

59:09.313 --> 59:11.647
Whoo!

59:25.328 --> 59:28.096
Cheers, Kathy,
to new beginnings.

59:28.098 --> 59:30.032
London!
To London.

59:30.034 --> 59:31.967
To London!
To London!

59:31.969 --> 59:33.936
Oh, thank you, Judy.
Thank you all so much!

59:33.938 --> 59:36.939
Kathy has always been
one for an adventure.

59:36.941 --> 59:40.275
Well, Dan's just
been on an adventure,
right, Dan?

59:40.277 --> 59:41.643
Mogadishu.

59:41.645 --> 59:43.779
Just a little jaunt
to the famine?

59:43.781 --> 59:44.980
He went with the press
corps actually.

59:44.982 --> 59:46.014
The first ones in.

59:46.016 --> 59:48.317
I was talking
to your grandpa.

59:48.319 --> 59:50.852
He's so excited about
your coming to London.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.588
He's gonna
take you around to see
all the schools.

59:52.590 --> 59:54.122
He'll help you
to choose one.

59:54.124 --> 59:56.992
That's actually not really
my plan for the moment, mom.

59:56.994 --> 59:59.728
You've changed your mind
just like that?

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.129
Well, a lot of things
have changed.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.865
Oh, you want
to take a year off.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.133
I totally get that.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.069
No, no, no.
I want to take a year on,

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.105
or two or three.
I don't know.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.107
A year on doing what?

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.309
Doing what I've been doing.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:16.845
Okay, the good news is,

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.814
you don't have to make
this decision right now.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:21.216
You're not
listening to me.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.818
Dan.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.187
There are other ways
to get an education.

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:29.858
Yeah, but you can't live
your life on safari.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:33.028
Well, it's my life, mom.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.197
I mean, it's my life.
No, tell me, tell me.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:36.999
What could I possibly learn
that I'm not learning now?

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:38.800
I've walked around places

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.802
these professors have only
read about in geography books.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.373
So what? Business?
Economic theory?

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.974
Try and negotiate
your way around a souk.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:49.011
Social studies?
Give me a break.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:55.017
Well, you have to consider
the cost of missing out.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.251
Well, you should have
thought about that

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.786
before you planned
to leave us.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:59.321
Dan.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:00.322
Dan, don't go!

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:05.894
I'm so sorry.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.329
Cheers, cheers.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.703
Does it tickle?
Yes.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.840
What?

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.886
Do you like it?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.421
Very much.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.248
You can't do it
that way.

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.886
You can't do it
that way.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.324
What's wrong, saba?

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.974
When I was five,

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:02.878
a neighbor
came by our house.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.847
He touched me.

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.916
I told my grandmother,

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.118
and she was so angry.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.155
She yelled at me
for the shame of it.

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:16.158
I think she was ashamed.

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.462
And then one day

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.431
she took me
to a fancy house.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:27.202
People came by
and brought me flowers.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:31.873
I thought it was
some kind of party.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.075
Then they laid me down.

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:36.545
I was crying
for my mother.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.416
They held me...

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:47.956
And they cut me
down there.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:52.294
There was blood
and pain,

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.363
burning hot.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:59.501
I still feel it
sometimes.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:02.003
Is that possible?

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.243
Scarred.
I was stitched up.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.111
Totally?

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:12.013
No, not totally.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.050
Do you think I am
some kind of freak?

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.952
You're not a freak.

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:23.592
So, well...

01:04:23.594 --> 01:04:29.965
Are there things that,
you know, feel good?

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.567
Who cares what I like?

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:34.369
I do.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.044
Hmm.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.622
All right.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:56.358
Zone number one.

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:04.900
Dan?

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:05.901
Yes?

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.435
Um, you missed a bit.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.515
Where are you going?

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:58.286
They sent us on our way.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:06.728
So why do you want
to go to Somalia?

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.364
I think I can sell
some photos.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.367
No. Why do you
want to go?

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.671
It's hard to think
about going back

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.006
to just scratching
and doodling

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.307
on pictures of my friends.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:25.046
Dan:And you?

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:27.248
Is it decided?

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:32.020
I have the chance
to go to the Sudan

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.255
with people I've been
working for, an ngo.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.558
I'd be part
of the start-up of
the program up there.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.060
Or I go to Cambridge

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:42.530
because that's
what's expected of me,
demanded of me.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:45.433
That's an easy one.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.669
I can hear it
in your voice.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.304
But then
i start wondering

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:51.506
if school might do more
good in the long run.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.476
Right, but you have the chance
to do something direct,

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:56.478
now, firsthand,
like I'm doing.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.580
Maybe I could make
some kind of change

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.215
that won't change back
once we're not around.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:02.550
Right, but how
can you possibly
be good at something

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:03.785
that you're not
passionate about?

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.154
That's crap.
That's compromise.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:09.290
I'd be disowned.
They're not joking.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.328
That's bullshit.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:29.744
Not everyone is like you.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.522
You see, I can't
send a staffer out

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.390
on full pay for more
than a few days.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:45.060
I need all the help
i can get in the office.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.261
All hands on deck.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.363
But you.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.098
I need a beach bum,

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.067
a backpacker
like you, lad.

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.334
You're young and hungry

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:54.836
and won't bleat
about working too hard.

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.538
You're a man
who actually likes

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.207
the shit holes of Africa.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:02.277
Nobody'd miss you,
except perhaps your mother.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:04.145
I'm gonna
give you a chance.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.281
50 bucks
every shot we run.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.217
Just run everything past
a second set of eyes.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:11.586
Make me look good.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.521
Warm beer and
smelly pussy.

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.423
Keep feeding the beast.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.492
"The United States government
is set to announce

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.426
"a non-aggressive
military operation

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.763
"to establish
a secure environment

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.198
for humanitarian relief
to Somalia."

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.631
The Americans are coming.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.201
Well, because
of our stories.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.303
Bush says they're coming
for one reason only.

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:30.404
"Once the corridors
of famine relief
have been established,

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.340
we will depart."

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.175
Operation restore hope.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:36.644
President bush:
<i> I have given the order</i>

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.580
<i> to secretary Cheney</i>
whoo!

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:42.550
<i> To move a substantial</i>
<i> American force into Somalia.</i>

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.252
<i> The people of Somalia,</i>

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:47.522
<i> especially the children</i>
<i> of Somalia, need our help.</i>

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.624
<i> We must give them hope.</i>

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:52.527
<i> America must act.</i>

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.613
Let's go through here.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.482
If there's shooting,

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.917
find out where the shots
are coming from,

01:09:15.919 --> 01:09:17.218
what kind of weapons.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.553
Don't trust the locals.

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:20.354
Misinformation
is their favorite weapon.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.590
And, Dan, don't think
for a second

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.791
that looking
through that camera

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.792
is any kind
of protection.

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:42.477
Little overdressed for the
weather, aren't you, soldier?

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.479
Regulation brain bucket.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:46.247
What's your name,
soldier?

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.483
Master corporal
Charles marazzo.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.218
Female soldier:
Aka Chuck.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.886
Who's the enemy,
corporal Chuck?

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:55.890
Hunger, sickness, starvation.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.592
What are you
gonna do about it,
corporal Chuck?

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.194
Just here
to do my duty, sir.

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:00.361
Feed the people.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.463
Are you gonna quote him
in the papers?

01:10:02.465 --> 01:10:03.965
Nah, just
taking pictures.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.949
Long time, long time.
Good to see you, man.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:52.347
You got a dead body
here. Nice shot.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.549
Where's the metaphor?

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.318
What you need is
a living juxtaposition.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.853
Someone grieving.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:02.690
I took thousands of shots
before I got my first play.

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.426
Don't worry.
It'll happen.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.729
Why do you say
don't trust the locals

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.031
if theirs is the story
we're trying to tell?

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:12.033
That's not what I meant.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:13.668
Are you gonna eat
the rest of this?

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.970
Yeah, but
it's what you said.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.740
I meant in purely
practical terms.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.908
Don't get too close.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.844
The idea that the press
is neutral,

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:25.546
is immune somehow,
is a thing of the past.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:27.448
Get to one of us
as an example,

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.451
as a hostage even,
you get attention

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.520
if someone is desperate
to be heard,

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:35.056
and the somalis
are desperate.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:36.724
So you can't trust them.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:39.727
All of them?

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:41.629
Are you listening to me?

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.927
Ah, man, this sucks.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.183
Get off the street now!
Go! Go! Go!

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.031
Hey! Stop! Get down!

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:02.970
Who were you gonna
use this on, huh?

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.806
Who were you
gonna use this on?

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.177
Hey! Hey!

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:20.955
Hey! Hey!

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:30.231
Are you all right,
you little twit?

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:33.501
Is he okay? Look out.
Look out. Let me see.

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:34.802
Yeah, you're all right.
Come on, up you get.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:38.940
Come on. Hey,
you know where he lives?

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.641
Where's your home?

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.685
Is it straight or is this--

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:53.488
this way, yeah?

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.963
Hello.

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:03.731
Abdi,
what are you doing?

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.566
My dear son.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:07.235
Who beat you, my brother?

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:08.903
The same guys who
beat me yesterday.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:09.937
Go and find your father.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:11.172
Go! White man
waiting for him.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.240
Come inside, please.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.681
Come. Come. Let's go.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:24.085
Wait for me one minute.
I'm coming, guys.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:27.555
Does he work with them?

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:29.524
He helps them
only in the afternoon

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:30.691
after his lesson.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.527
Don't you worry?

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.529
I fear for his safety.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:37.565
I wonder
if he will come back
or whether he will die.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:39.700
We let him go
because he's useful.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.737
He can protect us
from the other clans.

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:46.240
Come, issa.
You must go to work,

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:50.244
but you must also think
about going to study.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:51.979
Let's go, waraya.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.315
<i> Ah, benvenuto.</i>

01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:56.984
Journalist. Do you
speak Italian? French?

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.053
No. Swahili and English.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.655
Well, welcome then.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:01.923
I see you
have met my family.

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.891
Yeah. You know, your
English is very good.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.060
Two years
studying in Boston,

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.995
three in Germany.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.163
Please take a seat.

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:11.332
Oh, you are welcome.

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:49.870
Dan: Thanks.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.977
<i> Geeri waa oggolnahay.</i>

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.679
It means "i accept death."

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.715
All Somalians accept death.

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:03.618
My uncles all die
in clan war.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.720
Father no longer
accepts death.

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:07.054
He meets with other men

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.690
in different clans
to try for peace.

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:12.760
And what about you?

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.133
<i> Geeri waa oggolnahay.</i>

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.706
Go! Get inside.

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:01.075
Go! Stay down!

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.397
Dan, you okay?
Yeah.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:31.472
Loudspeaker:

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.734
Shaffi:
All right. Hang on.

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:02.503
Okay, I got you.
You go, John Wayne.

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.338
You ready? All right.

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:13.047
There's a new sheriff
in town.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:16.250
Come to clean up
these streets.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.519
You're the wrong kind of Indian
for this movie, kemosabe.

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.155
I need someone else.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.158
Did you get it?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.326
Oh!

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.205
Hey, crew.

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.274
I would like to propose
a toast

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.176
to baby Dan eldon,

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.944
who lost
his virginity today

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.280
with his first
European play.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.917
Applause, applause,
applause.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:52.386
Cheers.
<i> Salud.</i>

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.461
<i> I, William</i>
<i> Jefferson Clinton,</i>

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.463
<i> do solemnly swear...</i>

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:07.001
Dan: <i> Dear saba,</i>
<i> Somalia is a crazy place.</i>

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:10.237
<i> Though they call it</i>
<i> operation restore hope,</i>

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.239
<i> it seems</i>
<i> not even a superpower</i>

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:13.874
<i> can bring it fast enough.</i>

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:17.278
These are beautiful,
you talented little shit.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.013
<i> Defend the constitution</i>
<i> of the United States...</i>

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:20.314
<i> So help me, god.</i>

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.149
<i> So help me, god.</i>

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.856
What's going on?

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.925
The new man Clinton
has it in for aidid!

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:32.927
He's trying to show up
old man bush.

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.970
Careful!

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:02.423
Hmm.

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:04.892
I can't believe
you could be so stupid.

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.628
Oh, come on, duff.
This is a great shot.

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:10.164
Fuck you, Dan.
I'm not jealous.

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.332
I didn't mean that.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:12.867
I'm just not gonna
compliment you

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:14.501
on something that could
have gotten you killed,

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:16.637
'cause I don't want
to feel responsible.

01:21:16.639 --> 01:21:20.207
Does this look like
a humanitarian mission to you?

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:29.350
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.952
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! Pow!

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.324
Why do you want
to shoot at me?

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:38.893
I shoot the enemy.

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.661
Have you ever met a boy
from the darod clan, abdi?

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.638
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.641
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:56.410
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.013
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:02.016
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:05.119
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:08.422
Dan the man! Dan the man!

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:47.494
Where are all the kids,
Chuck?

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:52.099
Ambush!

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:13.187
Who is firing?

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:16.290
It's one of aidid's!

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.045
Treat a warlord
like a statesman,

01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:39.613
and he will behave
like a statesman.

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:42.649
Treat him like a warlord,
and he will behave as one.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:46.286
I saw aidid's men
shoot at his own people.

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:48.522
Who could be
that ruthless?

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.392
He would consider that
a small sacrifice.

01:23:51.394 --> 01:23:53.160
There is a Somalia
saying, which is,

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:55.696
"a millipede doesn't limp
from a broken leg."

01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:58.399
Aidid needs his people
to turn against America

01:23:58.401 --> 01:24:00.634
if he is to remain
the man in power,

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:02.236
and the only way
for him to do that

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:05.372
is to draw Americans in,
provoke,

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.707
force them
to do something terrible

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:09.443
to prove
his propaganda right.

01:24:09.445 --> 01:24:11.512
But the worst
possible thing,

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:14.114
the day you must dread,
is if it works.

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:17.418
If Americans
are led to attack
innocent Somali people,

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.355
then it will be a war
of all Somalians
against all others,

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:23.090
and no one will be safe.

01:24:23.092 --> 01:24:26.427
How do you see it?
The future?

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:29.229
I'm an engineer.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:33.734
In all this,
i see possibilities.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.146
Loudspeaker:
<i> Allahu akbar.</i>

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.220
Loudspeaker:
<i> Allahu akbar.</i>

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.790
Dan: <i> Saba, the wonder girl.</i>

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:59.793
<i> Saba, the magnificent.</i>

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.731
Loudspeaker:
<i> Allahu akbar.</i>

01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:08.435
<i> The last sunset</i>
<i> before my first new breath.</i>

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.240
Loudspeaker:
<i> Allahu akbar.</i>

01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:26.787
Mmm.

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:35.796
Hey, you. Is that
why you're back?

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:37.831
To show me
how clever you are?

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:40.634
I think that might be proof
of the opposite.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.305
You look
100 years older.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.708
I know you're angry.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.409
I was trying to apologize.

01:25:49.411 --> 01:25:50.644
You didn't answer
my letters.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.346
My father doesn't
want me with you.

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:54.348
You're still letting him
tell you what to do?

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:03.157
You're not Somali.
You do not understand.

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:05.192
People can change.

01:26:05.194 --> 01:26:06.860
Not my father.
Not my people.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:08.662
If that's what you think,
why did you go there?

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:11.431
Why not?
Why not think that?

01:26:11.433 --> 01:26:12.599
Because
you'll turn your backs,

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:14.801
and it will zoom
right back into chaos.

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:16.770
They don't want it to end.

01:26:16.772 --> 01:26:18.472
They don't want
a government.

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:19.806
And the warlords,

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:21.542
they make their fortune
from the disorder.

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:22.843
I'm not planning
to turn my back.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:25.846
Saba, there are
possibilities.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:26.880
I see them every day.

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:28.582
I know this kid.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:29.616
He's never even met
the enemy.

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:31.318
He doesn't hate anybody.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.954
Not yet, not till
somebody teaches him.

01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:36.857
There's no hope
for that kid.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.959
Until they do,
he is the hope.

01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.228
And what do you think
you can do about it?

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:47.568
I don't think that an
entire race is born cruel.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:50.704
Survival
forces them into it.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.673
Ignorance keeps them
from seeing the way out,

01:26:52.675 --> 01:26:54.274
but starvation, violence--

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:55.509
saba, so many
of the people I've met,

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:56.977
they've never known it
any other way.

01:26:56.979 --> 01:27:01.882
And somehow if there's
anything I can do

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:04.751
to open people's eyes,

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:06.820
to force the subject
to the top of the heap,

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:10.257
then that's
what I'm gonna do.

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:13.594
That's the only thing
i can think of to do.

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:50.631
I miss you
when you're away.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:51.932
We should make a plan.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:54.601
Yeah?
A safari.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:56.970
Yeah, I'll go back
one more time,

01:27:56.972 --> 01:28:00.374
and then we can meet
in the bush, you and me.

01:28:00.376 --> 01:28:03.277
Where to?

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.909
Coo-ee!

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:40.380
No.

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.351
Dan!

01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:46.486
Oh, the buzzer's broken.
Hold on. We'll come down.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:47.487
Yeah.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:49.423
Oh, Dan, I made a scrapbook

01:28:49.425 --> 01:28:50.557
of everything
you've ever published.

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:52.092
I have to find it for you.

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:54.528
It's tremendous.
I can't wait for you
to see it.

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:55.696
She's something,
isn't she?

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:59.533
You all right?

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:01.335
Yeah. Good.

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:02.536
Good.

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:03.870
But you first.
Tell me everything.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.972
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, really.

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:09.376
No, it's just
so crazy over there.

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:12.646
Well, we miss you.

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:14.748
Can't you stay longer,
just a little longer?

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:17.551
I know, I know. Actually,
I'm hoping to be staff now.

01:29:17.553 --> 01:29:19.386
Ahh.
The real thing, yeah.

01:29:19.388 --> 01:29:20.687
I'm getting closer.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:24.424
It's just, yeah,
now's not the time.

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.829
What's going on?
What, are you writing?

01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.764
Oh, yes, I'm writing.

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:31.998
I have
a book proposal in,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.800
and I think they're
gonna go for it.

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:36.803
All right.
Well, next time out,

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:38.772
I'm sending you
a ticket to Nairobi.

01:29:38.774 --> 01:29:41.575
We're gonna plan the house
I'll build you when you're old

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.076
so you can tend
to your goats

01:29:43.078 --> 01:29:45.045
and look after
my 10 children.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:46.847
No goats!

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:52.152
I am so proud of you.

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:56.423
I get really scared,

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:58.425
but I'm really proud

01:29:58.427 --> 01:30:00.427
that you're living
the life you love.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.931
And I'm sorry
that I wasn't there.

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:07.934
You know, I think
i get it now, mom,

01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:12.806
just why you had
to go your own way.

01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:17.511
I hated it, but, um,,,

01:30:17.513 --> 01:30:18.879
I get it.

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:25.852
Where do you think I got
this gypsy spirit from, anyway?

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:27.888
I love you, mom.

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:31.525
I love you too, bud.

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.495
Ta-da!

01:30:35.497 --> 01:30:37.097
There it is.
This is it.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.099
See you in a bit.
Okay.

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.434
So...

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.539
<i> Do we leave when</i>
<i> the job gets tough...</i>

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.176
<i> Or when the job is well done?</i>

01:30:56.584 --> 01:31:00.487
Jesus! Since when
are we the targets?

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:06.593
Come on, shaffi.
Let's go, let's go!

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.664
White people dying

01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:11.898
sells more papers
than black people.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.500
That's all they care about.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:14.801
No one gives a shit.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.102
There's nothing!
We're page 20!

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:17.604
We may as well not be here!

01:31:17.606 --> 01:31:19.739
Leave, then,
if no one gives a shit.

01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:20.874
That's not what I'm saying.

01:31:20.876 --> 01:31:22.008
What are you saying?

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:23.009
It's obvious, isn't it?

01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:24.811
Regular Somali folk

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:26.847
are getting shot
by soldiers.

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:28.248
That should be news.

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:29.850
And if nobody's
listening?

01:31:29.852 --> 01:31:31.117
It's what I'm saying, duff!

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:33.019
Man: Oh. Whoa.

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:41.228
We do not throw food!

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:53.874
I'm being transferred.

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:56.910
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.013
I'm being transferred.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:01.181
What? Where?

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:03.183
Bosnia.
Who's replacing you?

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.821
That's childish.
You wanna give me--

01:32:07.823 --> 01:32:08.822
sorry, man.

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:10.657
Scott--Scott!

01:32:10.659 --> 01:32:11.758
Dan eldon
just wants the facts.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.759
Let me see.

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:20.634
No one's replacing you.
I'm it.

01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:22.636
Staff assignment,
baby.

01:32:22.638 --> 01:32:23.637
Bravo!

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:26.606
Whoo!

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:31.278
Danny! Danny! Danny!

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.779
Whoo!

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.819
Are you all right,<i> babu?</i>

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:24.958
Pakistanis.
I knew some of them.

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:32.232
Jesus. What have they
done to the bodies?

01:34:32.234 --> 01:34:35.101
There's no skin.

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:38.938
I'll shoot it, mo.
Go home.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.775
No. No, you can't
shoot that.

01:34:41.777 --> 01:34:43.243
Think about it.

01:34:43.245 --> 01:34:45.679
If that gets out,
then he's won.

01:34:45.681 --> 01:34:47.213
If the world sees that,

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:49.215
then the U.S. will have to
do something to answer it.

01:34:49.217 --> 01:34:50.383
They will have to attack,

01:34:50.385 --> 01:34:52.152
which is exactly
what aidid wants.

01:34:52.154 --> 01:34:55.455
Terror is his weapon.

01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:59.259
You have to believe that
this is the end of it,

01:34:59.261 --> 01:35:03.430
that what we do
will turn it around.

01:35:03.432 --> 01:35:06.132
You have to, but
you don't always know.

01:35:06.134 --> 01:35:08.201
How can you?

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:11.471
Because it's not
black and white, huh?

01:35:11.473 --> 01:35:14.774
It never is.
It's--it's...

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:17.177
It's gray.

01:35:17.179 --> 01:35:20.947
The whole fucking thing
is gray.

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.940
You're right, Dan.

01:35:46.942 --> 01:35:48.475
What?

01:35:48.477 --> 01:35:51.111
You're right
not to shoot that.

01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:04.117
Dan: <i> I don't know how these</i>
<i> experiences are changing me,</i>

01:37:04.119 --> 01:37:05.952
<i> but I feel different.</i>

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:19.332
<i> Sweetie...</i>

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:22.168
<i> Sugar, kadogo...</i>

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.905
<i> Gisa, Somalia...</i>

01:37:25.907 --> 01:37:27.173
<i> Saba.</i>

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.513
<i> These are the things</i>
<i> I now know.</i>

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:41.521
<i> It is therapeutic</i>

01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:46.159
<i> to apply a well-toned,</i>
<i> beautiful naked body</i>

01:37:46.161 --> 01:37:48.528
<i> to one's own flesh</i>

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.997
<i> at least twice a day.</i>

01:38:07.082 --> 01:38:11.484
<i> It is foolish and hazardous</i>

01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:13.019
<i> not to dance in Africa.</i>

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:19.192
<i> The more music you like,</i>

01:38:19.194 --> 01:38:20.927
<i> the happier you will be.</i>

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:33.439
<i> Connection is the solution</i>
<i> to the problem.</i>

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:35.074
Thank you so much.

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:40.513
<i> This is the difference</i>

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:42.982
<i> between exploring</i>
<i> and being lost.</i>

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:11.210
Hos, when
did you get in?

01:39:11.212 --> 01:39:13.413
Just now.
I'm replacing you.

01:39:13.415 --> 01:39:15.048
You're going on leave.

01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:16.516
There's a car waiting to
take you to the airstrip.

01:39:16.518 --> 01:39:17.517
Now?
Yep.

01:39:17.519 --> 01:39:21.354
Guess I'll go pack.

01:39:21.356 --> 01:39:24.057
<i> Arrivederci, roma.</i>
I'm on leave.

01:39:24.059 --> 01:39:25.358
Where will you go?

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.060
On safari with saba.

01:39:27.062 --> 01:39:28.461
Saba who?

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:30.063
Saba, the wonder girl.

01:39:30.065 --> 01:39:33.066
Saba, the magnificent.

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:04.130
What's happening?

01:40:04.132 --> 01:40:06.099
Another
peacekeeping mission.

01:40:06.101 --> 01:40:07.467
Where's <i> babu?</i>
Anthony.

01:40:07.469 --> 01:40:09.469
Breakfast
with the pakistanis.

01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:11.137
Go and get his camera gear.

01:40:11.139 --> 01:40:12.638
Go on, Anthony.

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.108
This could be
your big chance.

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.546
Hos.
Hey, Anthony.

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.790
Where'd you
fly in from, hos?

01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:32.725
Rwanda. There's
a multi-party democracy

01:40:32.727 --> 01:40:35.261
threatening
to break out there.

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:39.265
Anybody got a 300?

01:40:39.267 --> 01:40:40.767
Yeah.

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:43.403
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:54.414
Anthony!

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:00.353
Anthony!

01:41:00.355 --> 01:41:01.387
<i> Babuji,</i>

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:02.488
he's setting up
your gear.

01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:04.190
Good boy, Anthony.

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:23.543
What could possibly
be left?

01:41:23.545 --> 01:41:25.778
Aidid.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:28.314
That's who they're after.

01:41:28.316 --> 01:41:30.550
And this is exactly
what he wants.

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:33.619
Gonna get you help
inside.

01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:35.288
You all right?
Jesus, this is heavy.

01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:36.789
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
You okay, yeah?

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:38.724
Bring him this way.
Inside, yeah?

01:41:38.726 --> 01:41:41.127
We got steps, okay?

01:41:41.129 --> 01:41:42.695
Just set him down
here.

01:41:42.697 --> 01:41:45.698
Sit down here.
Steady.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.135
There was this silence,
this god-awful emptiness

01:41:49.137 --> 01:41:50.570
like I've never
experienced before.

01:41:50.572 --> 01:41:52.238
Yeah, we saw the shelling.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.506
I thought they'd never stop.

01:41:53.508 --> 01:41:54.707
It wasn't just shells, man.

01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:57.176
There's this guy inside,
sanjeeh.

01:41:57.178 --> 01:41:58.444
His arm was shredded,

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:01.114
but he was playing dead
to save himself.

01:42:01.116 --> 01:42:03.483
He said the ground troops
came in

01:42:03.485 --> 01:42:06.119
after the shelling
like a sweep.

01:42:06.121 --> 01:42:08.588
If they saw anyone shouting,
they shot them.

01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:09.622
What the fuck?

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:11.824
He saw maybe 15
go that way,

01:42:11.826 --> 01:42:13.826
like grandfathers,
fathers, sons.

01:42:13.828 --> 01:42:15.661
I got there just as
they were clearing out,

01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:16.696
so I didn't see it go down.

01:42:16.698 --> 01:42:18.564
Qaybdiid house is rubble.

01:42:18.566 --> 01:42:20.733
- Qaybdiid? The villa?
- Yeah.

01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:24.237
Scott, come on,
let's get this.

01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:25.338
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.706
Wipe his face there.
Wipe his face.

01:42:26.708 --> 01:42:28.608
Anthony, get in closer.

01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:29.909
Do you need someone
to hold you up?

01:42:29.911 --> 01:42:31.177
No, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

01:42:31.179 --> 01:42:32.612
Leave the blood, guys,
all right?

01:42:32.614 --> 01:42:33.679
Yeah.

01:42:33.681 --> 01:42:34.914
All right,
frame you up.

01:42:34.916 --> 01:42:36.449
All right.

01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:40.153
The gunship attack
was in response to...

01:42:40.155 --> 01:42:41.654
Okay, stay with me.

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.856
The gunship attack
was in response

01:42:43.858 --> 01:42:45.358
to U.S. intelligence

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.426
that Somali warlord
general aidid

01:42:47.428 --> 01:42:49.328
was conducting
a council of war.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.797
But it seems
intelligence was misled.

01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:53.699
Aidid was not present.

01:42:53.701 --> 01:42:56.469
It was instead
a meeting of elders

01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:58.604
and respected members
of the Somali community

01:42:58.606 --> 01:43:01.240
who were there
to discuss peace initiatives.

01:43:01.242 --> 01:43:04.343
When the U.S. ground forces
withdrew,

01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:06.946
I realized
i was in the wrong place.

01:43:06.948 --> 01:43:08.814
Somalis came
from all directions,

01:43:08.816 --> 01:43:11.784
and they saw me
as European being there,

01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:14.387
and they set upon me.

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.378
We come after.
Come now, shaffi.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.415
Show what America
has done now. Come.

01:43:42.417 --> 01:43:44.483
It's not worth
the risk, shaffi.

01:43:44.485 --> 01:43:46.485
Please come.
Take picture.

01:43:46.487 --> 01:43:48.354
There are many, many
dead women and children.

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:50.890
You must come.
Show what America has done.

01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:53.292
And show how America,
a world nation,

01:43:53.294 --> 01:43:55.428
make war against
innocent people.

01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:58.431
Please come.

01:43:58.433 --> 01:44:00.666
Dan, the driver's
waiting for you.

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:21.287
<i> Babu?</i>

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:26.592
Hey, will you
guarantee our safety?

01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:28.494
Forget it, Dan.
It's fucking dangerous.

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:30.730
Yeah, we guarantee.
Come on now.

01:44:30.732 --> 01:44:31.797
Yeah?
Come, please.

01:44:31.799 --> 01:44:33.332
Anthony.

01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:35.268
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:36.969
I want to.

01:44:36.971 --> 01:44:39.705
I'll come, too.
Come now.

01:44:39.707 --> 01:44:41.407
Okay. All right,
we come, we come!

01:44:41.409 --> 01:44:43.409
Please now!
Now, now, now.

01:44:43.411 --> 01:44:45.711
<i> Babu,</i> let's go.
Come on, guys.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.520
What the hell
are we doing up front?

01:45:27.522 --> 01:45:29.755
Hey, wariah.
Tell him to get in front!

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:55.715
Are you afraid,
<i> babuji?</i>

01:45:57.684 --> 01:46:01.721
If I'm shot, it will be
with an American bullet,

01:46:01.723 --> 01:46:04.557
not a Somali one.

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.830
Get out! Abdi?

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:18.738
Do what he say.
Do what he say.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.939
Do what he say.
Do what he say.

01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:21.040
Do what he say.

01:47:22.804 --> 01:47:24.970
What the hell is he doing?

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:31.944
Is it safe?
It's all right.

01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:34.113
Are we all right?
Come.

01:47:34.115 --> 01:47:35.614
Let's go.

01:48:32.206 --> 01:48:35.140
I count 70,
maybe 80 dead.

01:48:35.142 --> 01:48:36.675
We must be quick.

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:24.890
Let's go over there.

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:26.278
Shaffi: No. No.

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:32.851
No. I'm not American.

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:40.926
Go, Anthony! Go!

01:51:40.928 --> 01:51:43.929
Dan! Dan!
Dan, get out!

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:23.736
Aah! No, please!

01:52:23.738 --> 01:52:25.370
No!

01:52:31.277 --> 01:52:33.912
Pilot: <i> Caucasian male</i>
<i> being pursued.</i>

01:52:33.914 --> 01:52:36.181
<i> Request</i>
<i> crowd dispersal tactics.</i>

01:52:36.183 --> 01:52:37.850
Base: <i> All ground troops</i>
<i> accounted for, little bird.</i>

01:52:37.852 --> 01:52:38.884
<i> Return to base.</i>

01:52:38.886 --> 01:52:41.019
Returning to base.

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:44.256
TV reporter:
<i> In mogadishu today,</i>

01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:46.091
<i> an enraged crowd</i>
<i> attacked journalists</i>

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:48.293
<i> following an assault</i>
<i> by American cobra gunships</i>

01:52:48.295 --> 01:52:50.529
<i> on the home of general aidid's</i>
<i> interior secretary.</i>

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:13.185
No! Aah! Aah!

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:46.945
Thank you for coming here
to celebrate Dan's life.

01:54:46.947 --> 01:54:48.547
I think that
if Dan were here,

01:54:48.549 --> 01:54:49.882
he would say...

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.217
That you only have
a short time

01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:54.086
to dance on this earth,

01:54:54.088 --> 01:54:57.122
and I think he would say,
you choose the music.

01:54:57.124 --> 01:54:59.091
You sing it loudly.

01:54:59.093 --> 01:55:01.059
You dance it proudly.

01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:03.462
And the most important thing

01:55:03.464 --> 01:55:06.398
is that you dance
with love.

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:10.602
Amy?

01:55:16.309 --> 01:55:19.411
Our four brothers
were doing their best

01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:22.547
to show the world
what was happening

01:55:22.549 --> 01:55:26.084
in one corner of Africa.

01:55:26.086 --> 01:55:29.288
We thought
that we had a lifetime

01:55:29.290 --> 01:55:35.027
to tell you I love you

01:55:35.029 --> 01:55:37.062
and I'm proud of you,

01:55:37.064 --> 01:55:39.398
but we didn't.

01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:44.603
I love you, Dan.

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.142
Goodbye until I see you again.
