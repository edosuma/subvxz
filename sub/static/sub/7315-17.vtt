WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:05.671
We should have some
extra space right back here.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.373
This do you good?

00:07.375 --> 00:10.676
The hero comfort
foundation wants to give
away a thousand of these

00:10.678 --> 00:13.445
T-shirts after the
concert and, so we
just really need...

00:13.447 --> 00:14.680
Need a place where you
can get to 'em fast, huh?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.382
Yeah, I know the drill.
Yeah.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.519
But... That's not why I picked
this particular boudoir.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.687
(laughs)

00:21.689 --> 00:23.689
Ah.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.024
(hums a tune)

00:26.359 --> 00:27.726
Hmm?

00:27.728 --> 00:30.129
This is a vintage '62.
A beaut, huh?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.731
Overheard one of the
musicians during rehearsal.

00:32.733 --> 00:36.635
Said it was given to him
by merle haggard.
God. Wow.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.272
Why don't you give her a whirl?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.573
I don't think that's
a good idea, man.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.075
It's just, uh...
Oh. (laughs)

00:43.077 --> 00:44.576
What's the worst
that can happen?

00:44.578 --> 00:48.213
I keep hearing what a badass
you are-- from you.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.782
Time to put up or shut up.

00:49.784 --> 00:51.784
All right.

00:51.786 --> 00:54.653
(explosion)

01:26.086 --> 01:28.287
(laughing)
man (over phone):
No, no, no, no.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.724
Somebody's having a good day.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.659
I don't think so.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.561
Oh, that's
a good one.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.096
(coughs)
man: I'm not joking;
I'm serious.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.730
What do you mean you're serious?

01:38.732 --> 01:39.731
Told you.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.501
Dad, it's <i>your</i> wedding.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.105
You and linda should be planning
it. I c-can't get involved in...

01:46.107 --> 01:48.507
No, no, no, no, no. (chuckles)
save the date cards

01:48.509 --> 01:50.442
Are like crack cocaine to women.
Mm,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.512
Not this woman.
Of course, I'm honored

01:53.514 --> 01:55.714
That you would trust me
to plan your wedding.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.416
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure

01:57.418 --> 01:59.785
Than to plan your wedding.
But I... Hello?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.720
No, no, no, no...
Hello?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.789
(dial tone drones)

02:04.791 --> 02:06.191
He got me.

02:06.193 --> 02:09.128
(hangs up)
he just pulled the

02:09.130 --> 02:10.896
"this is my wedding gift
to him" card.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.265
Well, that's a very nice one.
Mm-hmm.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.134
I guess it beats the steak
knives I was gonna re-gift him.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.635
Hmm.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.605
Hey, bishop...
Hmm?

02:19.607 --> 02:20.906
You've done this.
Mm-mm.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.142
Forget it. No, my
wedding was so small

02:23.144 --> 02:24.776
I practically eloped.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.812
Give me a down payment
on a house over a

02:26.814 --> 02:30.382
Rubber chicken dinner
any day of the week.
All right, I got this.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.451
What do katherine heigl
and j. Lo have in common?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.619
Wedding planner.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.155
No, tony.
No, no, no.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.789
It's a waste of money.
Let me tell you something.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.158
There's web sites
out there that'll

02:39.160 --> 02:40.692
Walk you through
the whole process.

02:40.694 --> 02:44.229
Plan a guest list,
even order invitations.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.698
Look at this-- it's one
of my favorite sites.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.834
Do-it-yourself napkin folding?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.736
Yeah.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.504
The goblet fan's
pretty classy, huh?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.839
Yeah, this isn't at all weird.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.674
You can save
thousands of dollars

02:55.676 --> 02:56.708
By doing your own
place settings.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.644
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.345
I am not paying
for the wedding,

03:00.347 --> 03:01.647
I am planning the wedding.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.714
Mcgee:
You sure?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.383
Was your dad
that specific?

03:04.385 --> 03:06.618
Oh... Okay.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.220
In that case,
the goblet fan

03:08.222 --> 03:09.388
Might be too complicated.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.789
He's more of a
french pleat guy.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.924
Mcgee: Problem with
the french pleat:

03:11.926 --> 03:13.725
It's not as easy
to do as it looks.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.894
Oh, yeah. Gotta have
a pretty high thread count

03:15.896 --> 03:17.429
To get that
straight angle, huh?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.931
Mcgee:
Exactly.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.899
Hey, look, a
bishop's hat.
Yeah.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.603
Hey, boss.
We were just...
Scaring me.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.305
Dead sailor.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.573
Convention center.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.408
Move.

03:31.511 --> 03:32.778
(camera shutter clicks)
wow.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.746
Oh, that's
such a shame.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.815
Vintage '62 telecaster.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.918
Yeah, a real tragedy.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.254
Yeah, 'cause...

03:42.256 --> 03:44.256
The dead people are a shame,
too, it's just...

03:45.525 --> 03:47.693
Oh, look, it's mcgee!

03:47.695 --> 03:49.361
Fire chief doesn't know yet

03:49.363 --> 03:50.862
The cause of the explosion.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.965
Maybe a gas line.
Luckily, the sprinklers

03:52.967 --> 03:54.533
Put out the fire pretty fast.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.535
But not fast enough,
it appears.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.771
Unless our victims
were killed by the
explosion itself.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.807
Yeah, or something else.
You never know.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.543
I like the way you think,
mr. Palmer.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.878
To whom do we have
the displeasure?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.781
Tony:
The older one is
earl grieves, 54.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.950
He's the head janitor
for the auditorium.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.852
Military charity was
hosting a concert here.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.521
"hero comfort foundation."

04:16.523 --> 04:18.624
Not much comfort today.
Bishop:
Gibbs.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.359
Gibbs:
You're gonna need dental
on the sailor, duck.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.527
You mean petty officer
damien hunter?

04:22.529 --> 04:24.529
Oh, my god.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.864
Gibbs, this is
director vivian sutton.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.599
She runs the
local hcf office.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.902
And this is...
Luke pischedda.
Concert coordinator.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.638
Vivian:
Damien was working for us.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.805
What happened?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.407
Well, you're looking at it.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.642
What kind of work
was he doing?

04:36.644 --> 04:37.909
Luke:
He was a volunteer.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.911
We have a concert
tomorrow for the troops...

04:39.913 --> 04:41.380
(sniffles)

04:41.382 --> 04:42.881
...And he was
helping...

04:42.883 --> 04:45.284
He was helping make
sure that families

04:45.286 --> 04:47.286
Of deployed servicemen
would be able to attend.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.721
Which we still
plan on.
Not here.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.590
Tony:
The venue's closed
until it can be verified

04:51.592 --> 04:52.591
Structurally sound.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.825
Oh, don't worry.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.661
The hcf is a
military charity.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.296
If it's one thing we know
how to do, it's improvise.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.997
The show
will go on.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.366
And we should
dedicate this to damien.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.668
Everyone did love him.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.902
Mcgee:
Not everyone.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.037
This wasn't
an accident.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.738
Fire chief says this was

05:06.740 --> 05:09.007
The source of the explosion.
It's a...

05:09.009 --> 05:11.009
Warhead shell from
a mark 24 torpedo.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.010
Mark 24?
Aren't those from...

05:12.012 --> 05:14.079
World war ii.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.922
Petty officer first
class damien hunter

05:23.924 --> 05:26.758
Graduated with honors
from rtc great lakes.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.794
Did two tours on
the uss <i>carl vinson</i>

05:28.796 --> 05:30.962
Before being assigned to
the pax river chow hall.

05:30.964 --> 05:34.466
Where he didn't gain a pound,
which is impressive.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.934
Being around all that
food all the time?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.936
I mean, if that were me,
I would...

05:39.472 --> 05:41.940
I'd-I'd probably, um...

05:41.942 --> 05:44.109
Get back into the case.
Yeah. Me, too.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.378
Well, our answer for now

05:46.380 --> 05:48.347
Is the deaths appear
to be collateral damage.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.948
Abby says
the bomb

05:49.950 --> 05:51.450
Wasn't set to go
off until midnight.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.018
She thinks it was
detonated accidently

05:53.020 --> 05:54.920
By some kind
of vibration.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.855
Tony:
Fire chief's final
report says the explosive

05:56.857 --> 05:58.824
Was hidden inside
an old torpedo shell

05:58.826 --> 06:00.058
That was used
as set dressing.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.626
What was the target?

06:01.628 --> 06:02.928
Mcgee:
It's not a what.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.863
It's a who.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.398
The room was also being used

06:06.400 --> 06:07.933
As a dressing room

06:07.935 --> 06:09.968
For one of the acts
in hcf's concert.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.970
Tony:
Yikes.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.605
What kind of concert
is it, exactly?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.841
Well, the charity
is calling it

06:15.843 --> 06:18.610
The country rock
back-up bands tour.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.545
Tony:
So it's a concert of
bands that normally opens

06:20.547 --> 06:21.780
For other bands?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.115
Who opens
for them?
Him.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.117
He's the opening act.
Manheim gold.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.985
According to the director,
he used to open for

06:26.987 --> 06:28.453
All the big names,
back in the day.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.654
Where is he now?

06:29.656 --> 06:30.889
Mcgee:
Nobody knows.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.157
He never showed up
for rehearsal.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.793
Find him.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.997
Wow, this
manheim guy

06:38.999 --> 06:40.732
Really did open for
all the big names.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.033
How come I've never
heard of him?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.568
Keep reading.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.903
Ouch, yikes.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.571
Yeah, he threw one
too many tvs

06:46.573 --> 06:47.906
Out his hotel window.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.574
Oh, and his first agent.
Mm, great.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.843
Well, lucky for them both,
there was a pool below.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.412
(door bell chimes)
all right.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.180
This is manheim's
day job.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.716
Bishop:
Hello?

06:57.718 --> 06:58.984
Hello?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.419
You think it
would be weird

07:00.421 --> 07:01.720
If I asked him
for an autograph?

07:01.722 --> 07:02.988
Not any weirder

07:02.990 --> 07:04.022
Than tony asking
for a suspect's

07:04.024 --> 07:05.424
Phone number.
Hmm.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.492
(bell dings)
hello?

07:07.494 --> 07:08.660
Anybody home?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.085
What do you think happened?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.455
Well, it looks like someone
was looking for something.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.790
Or worse.
I'll call in
the bolo.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.626
Okay...

07:42.562 --> 07:44.463
(thuds)

07:44.465 --> 07:47.199
Uh...
And... Done.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.934
Not bad.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.602
53 seconds.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.104
Unfortunately, your
subject suffered

07:53.106 --> 07:56.141
A subdural hematoma from
excessive manhandling.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.676
You said to go fast.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.544
I told you to be efficient.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.546
The sleep cycle
of an infant

08:01.548 --> 08:02.981
Is only 50 minutes.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.683
If you have to
change the diaper

08:04.685 --> 08:05.951
(door whooshes open)
of a sleeping child,

08:05.953 --> 08:07.619
You need to
be efficient.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.254
I would also think
that you need to...

08:09.256 --> 08:10.689
Gibbs:
Keep the lights low

08:10.691 --> 08:11.957
(door whooshes closed)
and the room quiet.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.959
Okay, low lights,
quiet room,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.161
No hematoma...
Got it.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.497
I think.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.965
My checklist keeps
growing every day.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.167
Mr. Palmer is
getting in some

08:22.169 --> 08:24.002
Last-minute
practice.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.704
Jimmy:
Our birth mother
was due yesterday, so...

08:25.706 --> 08:27.672
She could pop any second.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.040
Congratulations, jim.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.143
You gotta go?
Oh, no, no, no.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.979
No, I'm fine. No.
Breena's with her.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.013
The two of them have
really been bonding

08:35.015 --> 08:36.214
Over the
last month.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.183
The adoption papers
are all set,

08:38.185 --> 08:40.051
And, uh, and me...
I-I'm just, uh...

08:40.053 --> 08:41.520
Gibbs:
At work.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.555
Just not actually working.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.023
Well, uh... Well, that's...

08:45.025 --> 08:46.725
That's one way to put it.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.027
Yes, and easily remedied.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.762
Despite
mr. Palmer's

08:50.764 --> 08:51.997
Crime scene
supposition,

08:51.999 --> 08:53.598
The autopsies

08:53.600 --> 08:56.301
Of the two victims
produced no surprises.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.303
As you can see,
both victims were killed

08:58.305 --> 09:00.238
From blunt force trauma
from the blast.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.007
And if that
hadn't killed them,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.776
The smoke inhalation most
certainly would have.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.811
Apart from
being dead,

09:06.813 --> 09:09.114
Both these men were
in perfect health.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.017
We all should be so
lucky when we go.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.085
(phone ringing)

09:15.122 --> 09:18.623
(over phone): We found manheim.
What? You found him where?

09:18.625 --> 09:19.958
Yeah, yeah.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.259
Yeah. Go get him.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.263
Hey, you got a burp cloth?

09:25.265 --> 09:26.798
Mm-hmm.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.233
Get more.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.574
He was alive when
I picked him up
at the drunk tank.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.841
(groans)

09:38.878 --> 09:41.179
That was cruel and unusual, man.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.881
I'm special agent gibbs.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.349
Special agent?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.152
Since when is public
intoxication a federal crime?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.620
Tony:
It's not.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.688
Murder is.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.024
Gibbs:
A bomb exploded in your
dressing room this morning.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.192
Two people were killed.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.360
Is this some kind of joke?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.262
And somebody tossed
your bedroom.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.366
Manheim:
Actually, it, uh...

10:01.368 --> 10:03.268
Always looks like that.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.137
You know anybody that
would want you dead?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.740
Recently, no.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.343
Before? (laughs)
pretty much everybody
I ever met.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.645
Until I stopped
drinking.
I hate to break
it to you,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.380
But you spent the night
in the drunk tank.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.217
Yeah.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.353
15 years sober
down the drain.

10:21.355 --> 10:24.222
It's been a rough
few days.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.091
Brakes on my car were
starting to burn rubber

10:26.093 --> 10:27.359
And I couldn't afford new ones

10:27.361 --> 10:28.893
Until the end of the month.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.929
So I'm guessing
you didn't make it.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.264
Nah, took out a telephone pole.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.033
After that, I, uh,

10:35.035 --> 10:37.936
Felt sorry for myself,
and figured, well...

10:37.938 --> 10:40.238
One drink couldn't hurt.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.040
It hurt.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.776
Brakes go out, bomb goes off
in his dressing room--

10:44.778 --> 10:46.177
I'm sensing a pattern.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.946
Man:
Manheim! Manheim!

10:47.948 --> 10:50.882
Get off, man! Hey, enough.
No more questions.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.083
I raced over as
soon as I heard

10:52.085 --> 10:53.318
The feds picked you up.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.186
You don't have to say
another word.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.389
Tony: Actually,
yeah, he does.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.658
And who would you be?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.993
Uh, that's my agent.
Don't mind him.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.130
It's okay, bobby.
They're on my side,
for a change.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.998
They think somebody's
trying to kill me.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.299
What?
Yeah,

11:08.301 --> 11:10.335
A bomb went off
in my dressing room.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.337
Bobby:
Whoa. They told me

11:12.339 --> 11:14.305
They were moving the concert

11:14.307 --> 11:17.008
To the pax river navy base,
but they never told me why.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.209
(bobby groans)

11:18.211 --> 11:19.978
(panting):
This...

11:19.980 --> 11:23.181
(laughing):
This is great news, baby!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.950
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. We could
use the publicity.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.053
(chuckles):
I think you

11:28.055 --> 11:29.888
Just made yourself
a suspect, man.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.257
Oh! Look, all
I'm saying is,

11:32.259 --> 11:34.159
I got big plans for my boy here.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.827
We're at a critical juncture.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.328
(snaps fingers)
it's comeback time, baby.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.329
Gibbs:
It   <i>was</i>

11:38.331 --> 11:39.330
Comeback time, baby.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
Your boy is

11:40.967 --> 11:42.167
Out of the concert.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.235
What?! Why?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.304
No, no, no,
no, no. No.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.906
See, this is
gonna ruin everything.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.241
You can't do that.
Tony:
If the concert's

11:50.243 --> 11:52.010
On a navy base, yes, we can.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.345
Gibbs:
Someone is trying
to kill your client.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.315
He's not going anywhere--
except protective custody.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.497
(big sigh)

12:14.467 --> 12:16.968
All right, why don't
you grab five days'
worth of clothes.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.345
(panting):
Got it. Where we going?

12:27.347 --> 12:30.081
I think the first thing
we're gonna do is buy you
some more underwear.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.450
Mcgee: Back to ncis,
where you're gonna
make us a list

12:32.452 --> 12:36.387
Of suspects, then off to a hotel
we contract as a safe house.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.158
I like hotels.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.094
And throwing tvs
out windows, we heard.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.929
That's not me anymore.
(sighs)

12:44.931 --> 12:46.998
This concert
wasn't even my idea.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.101
Some kid in idaho posted
one of my old videos

12:50.103 --> 12:51.236
On the computer...

12:51.238 --> 12:53.238
Internet.
Whatever.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.106
Next thing I know,
bobby calls me,

12:55.108 --> 12:59.344
Says I got some heat,
books me on this
charity tour.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.381
My opinion...

13:03.383 --> 13:06.518
Some things are
better left in the past.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.187
Especially mine.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.421
I don't need to
make you a list

13:10.423 --> 13:11.923
Of people who want me dead.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.024
Pretty much everyone in here.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.126
Any of my first band.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.294
Any of my ex-wives.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.097
That's ronnie mustard,
my first agent.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.099
Heard you threw him out
a window, too.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.401
(laughs)
he bet me I couldn't. But, uh,

13:23.403 --> 13:25.236
You can strike him
off the list.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.038
He didn't make it out
of the '80s.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.039
Surfing accident, I think.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.274
You know, we were

13:29.276 --> 13:31.209
Kind of hoping for something

13:31.211 --> 13:32.911
A little more recent.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.246
You're looking at more recent.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.482
Although,
wait a sec.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.984
I might have something for you.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.154
A guy keeps coming in here
every few days the
last few weeks.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.424
Kind of squirrelly.
Keeps bringing me

13:46.426 --> 13:47.992
The same suit
to get cleaned.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.461
It hasn't been worn.
I can tell.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.897
Who keeps cleaning a suit
they haven't worn?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.933
Weird, right?

13:56.468 --> 13:58.303
Ducky:
"tilt and push the child
to face forward."

13:58.305 --> 13:59.904
Jimmy:
Keep pushing! Keep pushing!

13:59.906 --> 14:01.873
Bishop:
(groans) okay, my arm
is about to break off!

14:01.875 --> 14:05.043
"try threading both portions
of the vehicle belt

14:05.045 --> 14:07.879
As close to the
buckle plate
as possible."

14:07.881 --> 14:10.181
No, no, it's still
loose. Rats!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.050
What's going on?
Jimmy:
This is impossible!

14:12.052 --> 14:13.351
Okay, I think if you use
that latch thingy,

14:13.353 --> 14:16.154
I know, but the thing is
there's no latch thing

14:16.156 --> 14:19.157
Perhaps that seat
is not meant to go
in the center.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.325
It says here...
Okay, all due respect,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.526
Doctor, I-I know

14:21.528 --> 14:23.061
What it says.
It says that 75%

14:23.063 --> 14:24.362
Of all child restraints
are installed improperly.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.964
You guys need some help?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.034
Psst!

14:31.070 --> 14:32.170
(grunts)
come with me.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.406
Save yourself.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.942
Okay.
Maybe we could use
a fourth.

14:37.944 --> 14:38.977
Bishop:
It might be

14:38.979 --> 14:40.111
A little squashed
in here. No, no.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.279
Jimmy:
Okay, you're right.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.981
Let's just start from
the beginning, okay?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.616
How long they
been at it?
Like, an hour.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.517
I heard ducky curse
ten minutes ago.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.253
I mean, well,
I think I did.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.055
I'm not that familiar
with british profanity, but...

14:51.057 --> 14:52.257
What's in the box?

14:52.259 --> 14:55.159
Well, we need to I.D.
The owner.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.128
He didn't leave
his last name.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.463
Thought you could
pull some dna.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.165
I've been known to dabble
with some dna.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.901
Oh, yeah?
What are you dabbling in now?

15:02.903 --> 15:05.270
Torpedoes.
Or what's left of it.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.306
This is the mark 46
torpedo shell

15:08.308 --> 15:09.908
That the bomb
was hidden in.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.609
I was able to pull
a partial print,

15:11.611 --> 15:14.178
But it's not gonna do me
any good. And...

15:14.180 --> 15:17.148
Gibbs wanted me
to look at the brakes
on manheim's car.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.317
Yeah, manheim said
they were in pretty bad shape.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.153
Oh, they are.
But that's not why they failed.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.189
Someone put a pinhole

15:25.191 --> 15:26.557
In this brake line.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.393
Wow, someone's really
gunning for him.
Yeah.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.230
I mean, the good news for you
guys is that brake fluid stains.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.198
So if you work
your way back

15:34.200 --> 15:35.500
From the scene
of the car accident,

15:35.502 --> 15:37.068
You could probably find out

15:37.070 --> 15:39.070
Where his brake line
was punctured.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.172
Tony:
<i>Old drummer's dead,</i>

15:41.174 --> 15:43.274
Bass player dead,

15:43.276 --> 15:44.309
This guy's in jail,

15:44.311 --> 15:46.377
She joined a cult; nudist.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.713
Now she runs
a yoga studio in hawaii.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.114
Jail, then dead.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.984
The music business
is terrifying.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.119
You talk to anyone?

15:55.121 --> 15:57.655
Ah. Well, bishop's interviewing
manheim's old stage manager.

15:57.657 --> 16:01.125
Apparently, manheim
borrowed his boat 20 years ago,

16:01.127 --> 16:02.293
And then sunk it.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.628
Long time to hold a grudge.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.565
You should see that nest.
Oh, yeah, there we go.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.001
Thanks again.
Check that out.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.136
Mel gibson wants his hair back
from <i>lethal weapon.</i>

16:12.138 --> 16:14.272
Hey, you get anything good?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.740
Oh, it was amazing!

16:15.742 --> 16:18.009
He was at the craven country
jamboree in 1985.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.311
Tammy wynette, charley pride,
they were all there.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.214
He told me this one
story about, um...

16:23.216 --> 16:25.183
The alibi he had
for the past two weeks.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.317
He's not our guy.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.252
We should still arrest him
for that hairdo.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.454
Hey, what do you have
against mullets?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.456
It's the whole decade
I have trouble with.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.491
The '80s couldn't end
fast enough for me.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.028
Now, the '70s is a decade
I can get behind.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.030
How about getting
behind this case?

16:39.032 --> 16:41.332
That's a good point.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.368
Well, I got dorneget out
tracking brake fluid stains,

16:43.370 --> 16:46.204
And mcgee is on his way
to the safe house with
manheim...

16:46.206 --> 16:47.672
Not anymore.
...As we speak.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.540
Just got a call
from the hotel.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.409
They accidently overbooked--
we don't have a room.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.111
Try another hotel.
I did.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.613
All the ones ncis has approved
to use are also booked.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.248
There's a convention in town.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.319
Oh, yeah. No,
I'd love to have
him at my place,

17:01.321 --> 17:04.288
But my husband has
the stomach flu.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.523
My sister's visiting.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.792
Your sister's hot.
(chuckles)

17:18.303 --> 17:20.304
Manheim:
Nice place.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.373
Reminds me of some
of the, uh, classier
hotel rooms

17:22.375 --> 17:23.708
I've stayed in.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.810
Don't get any ideas.
You break it, you bought it.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.278
Don't worry.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.347
Like I said, that's
not me anymore.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.314
You play?

17:30.316 --> 17:33.651
Yeah. But first things first,

17:33.653 --> 17:35.520
I need you
to sign something here.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.291
What is it?

17:40.293 --> 17:42.260
Well, it's a document stating

17:42.262 --> 17:44.495
That you have, uh, read and
understood the house rules.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.830
You have rules?
Mm-hmm.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.098
On paper?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.366
Yeah.
For people to sign?

17:48.368 --> 17:49.400
Yeah.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.835
That's weird, man.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.337
Rule number four,
"don't insult your host."

17:53.339 --> 17:54.705
But I'll give you a pass

17:54.707 --> 17:58.142
Since you haven't had time...
To sign it yet.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.581
I'll, uh, I'll sign,

18:03.583 --> 18:05.516
But you gotta play
something first.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.386
Really?
Yeah.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.121
You want to hear me play?
Yeah.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.390
I guess nobody ever
really asked me to play.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.293
It's, uh, you know,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.427
It's a great guitar.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.731
I wrote this when I was 14.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.405
(pounding on door)
man: Open up!

18:27.407 --> 18:28.673
(hushed):
Stay here.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.344
(pounding continues)

18:39.284 --> 18:41.886
Hey. Manheim! Listen,

18:41.888 --> 18:45.256
Great news, baby.
Okay, how did you know
where he was?

18:45.258 --> 18:47.825
I texted him.
Nobody's supposed
to know where you are.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.129
He's my agent.
Grab your guitar.
I got you a gig tonight.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.698
What?
What? He's not
going anywhere.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.635
Manheim, you know how many
hits your old video has gotten?

18:57.637 --> 19:01.205
It's up to 18,000, baby!
You gotta be out there

19:01.207 --> 19:03.474
Seizing the momentum.
You know how it works!

19:03.476 --> 19:04.609
Yeah, you snooze, you lose.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.810
That's right.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.479
And agent gibbs
can't stop you this time.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.615
Okay, I'm not sure
you understand.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.383
He's in protective
custody

19:12.385 --> 19:13.484
For a reason.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.620
Well, then protect him
at the gig.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.355
Nobody's gonna try anything
in public.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.824
He's actually safer out there.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.792
No, he's not.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.329
Manheim, you want

19:25.331 --> 19:28.399
To be cleaning
people's dirty laundry
the rest of your life?

19:28.401 --> 19:31.502
Or do you want to smell roses
thrown at your feet?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.875
I know, I know. Listen, I didn't
really have a choice, boss.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.812
He's only got one set,
and then it's back to my place.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.482
Yeah, I...

19:44.484 --> 19:46.384
Okay.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.352
We're good.
Enjoy your beans.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.289
What is people's fascination
with this decade?

19:51.291 --> 19:54.225
I don't know.
I barely remember it.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.561
I mean, there were
some good movies.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.563
Scorcese did
king of comedy.

19:58.565 --> 20:02.200
Magnum p.I.
And supermodels...

20:02.202 --> 20:03.935
Leg warmers.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.204
Why do I hate
the '80s so much?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.373
Manheim, hey! Whoo!
You're on in five, baby.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.310
They won't even know
what hit 'em, right? Huh?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.378
Manheim! Manheim! Let's go.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.846
Let's go.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.848
Whoa-whoa!
You haven't played your set.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.750
I changed my mind. Let's go.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.853
No, wait a minute.
What about the momentum,
the roses?

20:22.855 --> 20:25.389
I'm allergic to roses.
This was a mistake.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.625
Are you getting
cold feet?
No.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.427
This feels cold-feety to me.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.962
I think I know the temperature
of my own feet.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.630
I don't even know why
I don't like the '80s.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.931
People are complicated.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.766
I understand.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.936
When was the last time
you performed?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.605
In public?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.273
Yeah.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.808
Not that long.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.477
Two, three... Decades.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.878
Three decades?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.947
You sure you know how
to play that thing still?

20:49.949 --> 20:52.483
I play every night. Alone.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.552
It's just...

20:54.554 --> 20:59.423
I'm not sure I like who I become
when other people are involved.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.492
(phone ringing)
that's interesting.
Hold that thought.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.327
Abby.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.029
Well, that's great.
Send it to me.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.531
Thank you.
That was our lab tech.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.701
She got a hit
from your suit.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.536
That's him. That's the guy.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.872
Who is he?
We're gonna find out.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.874
Don't look.
He's at the bar,

21:16.876 --> 21:20.544
Right over your
left shoulder.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.847
Hey, manheim, when
I say "don't look..."

21:22.849 --> 21:24.548
Hey!

21:24.550 --> 21:27.518
(grunting)

21:27.520 --> 21:28.853
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

21:28.855 --> 21:31.022
Nowhere.
Manheim:
Why are you following me?

21:31.024 --> 21:31.922
Who are you?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.358
I'm...

21:34.360 --> 21:36.427
I'm your son.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.940
(over intercom):
Hello? Uh,
I'd like to go home.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.943
I-I'm self-diagnosed
with ibs and, uh,

21:52.945 --> 21:55.846
Mild claustrophobia.
I am not feeling very well.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.015
There is no way that guy
is related to me.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.429
What is that?

22:11.431 --> 22:14.332
That's your father's
dressing room.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.935
And that's what happened
after a bomb went off inside.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.470
You know anything
about that?

22:19.472 --> 22:21.472
Uh, no.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.708
So why were you stalking him?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.110
I wasn't
stalking him.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.647
Three weeks ago, I thought
that my father was a firefighter

22:29.649 --> 22:31.015
Killed in the line of duty.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.517
Until I found my mother's diary
in our kitchen.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.919
He still lives with his mother?

22:34.921 --> 22:35.920
I want a dna test.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.488
Abby's already run it.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.656
Congrats.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.591
It's a boy. Sort of.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.893
I wasn't stalking
my father.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.895
I was building up the courage
to talk to him.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.934
I just wanted
to meet my real dad.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.779
Hey.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.447
Hey.

23:03.449 --> 23:06.884
(chuckles)
so, uh...

23:06.886 --> 23:09.854
I heard you're a cpa.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.790
That's a...

23:12.792 --> 23:15.393
That's a job...
(chuckles)

23:15.395 --> 23:17.094
People do. Uh...

23:17.096 --> 23:18.929
Yeah, I
know. I'm...

23:18.931 --> 23:20.598
One of 'em.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.099
Uh...

23:22.101 --> 23:23.868
Your mother, yeah.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.469
How's she doing?

23:25.471 --> 23:27.638
She has shingles.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.906
Yeah.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.409
Y-you don't remember her,
do you?

23:32.744 --> 23:33.878
(exhales)

23:33.880 --> 23:35.846
So how'd you find me?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.915
I, uh...
I tracked down your-your agent.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.885
He-he told me where you were.
Bobby?

23:40.887 --> 23:43.721
And he never said anything
to me?
No, who's bobby?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.923
No, this guy's name was,
um, mustard.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.692
Ronnie mustard.
Huh.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.428
Ronnie mustard's dead.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.663
Mcgee:
Ronnie mustard is not dead.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.833
He lives in maryland, still
hanging onto the music industry.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.034
These days, he books

23:57.036 --> 23:59.603
Mostly wedding
and bar mitzvah bands.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.005
Gibbs:
Hey.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.007
Manheim, he lie to us?
(tony chuckles)

24:03.009 --> 24:04.942
No. I think
he was just confused.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.012
I got the full download when
I dropped him back at my place.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.015
Apparently, manheim helped
mustard lay low in the '80s

24:11.017 --> 24:12.750
To avoid a nasty loan shark.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.618
He helped mustard
spread a rumor

24:14.620 --> 24:17.021
That he was dead.
You telling me
manheim forgot

24:17.023 --> 24:19.089
It was just a cover story?
I know it's odd.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.858
Keith richards seems
to remember everything,

24:20.860 --> 24:22.960
But manheim said
after he got out of rehab,

24:22.962 --> 24:24.228
He could barely
remember his own birthday,

24:24.230 --> 24:26.063
Much less what happened
to his agent.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.032
And when he asked around,
everyone told him

24:28.034 --> 24:29.533
Mustard was dead.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.469
So, why didn't
mustard resurface?

24:31.471 --> 24:32.970
That's a very
good question.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.605
Why don't you take mcgee,
and find out?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.474
Clear a path, clear a path!
It's happening!

24:36.476 --> 24:39.076
It's happening!
Ducky:
Mr. Palmer, please.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.011
Gibbs: Duck?
He just had a call.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.880
Birth mother is
going into labor.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.782
By the power of all humanity,

24:44.784 --> 24:46.116
I am ordering you to open!

24:46.118 --> 24:47.885
Jimmy?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.120
It's one floor down.
Maybe try the stairs?

24:50.122 --> 24:51.822
Your bag, sir?

24:51.824 --> 24:52.790
(elevator bell dings)
yeah! Yeah.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.696
Our little autopsy gremlin
is growing up.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.564
His whole life
is going to change.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.500
Over and over.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.701
(phone ringing)
yeah.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.569
Why is my building
manager calling?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.705
Isn't our musician staying
in your apartment?

25:07.707 --> 25:08.706
Yeah.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.541
I left him with agent holgate.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.709
Put it on a speaker.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.978
Hello? Is everything all right?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.679
No, mr. Dinozzo.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.014
You know we have a strict policy

25:17.016 --> 25:19.049
Regarding noise level
in our building.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.652
Yes, I helped you write
that policy.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.554
Then it's time you practiced
what you preach.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.588
The neighbors are complaining.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.990
About my apartment?!

25:25.992 --> 25:28.826
Is someone having
a party in my apartment?

25:28.828 --> 25:30.728
That's putting it mildly.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.229
(phone beeps)

25:32.231 --> 25:34.164
Clear a path!

25:34.166 --> 25:35.199
Make a hole!

25:35.201 --> 25:36.534
Make a hole!

25:36.536 --> 25:38.602
(loud rock music playing)

25:47.279 --> 25:49.079
Yes, yeah.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.148
Here you go.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.788
Yeah. (laughing)

25:59.791 --> 26:02.159
Tony:
Hey!

26:02.161 --> 26:04.161
No, no, no, no, no.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.831
(turns off music)

26:07.833 --> 26:09.099
(partygoers exclaim)

26:09.101 --> 26:10.768
All right!
(laughs)

26:10.770 --> 26:11.869
Okay.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.938
Put your drinks down.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.239
On a coaster!

26:15.241 --> 26:16.874
And make your way
in an orderly fashion

26:16.876 --> 26:18.776
To the front door.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.077
Or I will shoot you!

26:20.079 --> 26:22.079
That means you, mullet.
Bye, honey.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.681
Nobody get sticky fingers.

26:23.683 --> 26:24.682
Hey!

26:24.684 --> 26:26.216
Not you.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.790
Holgate, come here!

26:32.792 --> 26:34.291
Uh, he, uh...

26:34.293 --> 26:35.859
(laughs):
Oh, oh!

26:35.861 --> 26:38.062
(all laughing)

26:38.064 --> 26:40.898
Oh, 'cause I bet what happened
was that he said

26:40.900 --> 26:42.633
He wanted to go out
and have a little party.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.735
So you made an
executive decision.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.971
You decided, "hey, why don't

26:46.973 --> 26:48.939
We just have
the party right here?"

26:48.941 --> 26:52.109
And then things got
a little out of hand, and...

26:52.111 --> 26:54.078
Oh, I invented
that excuse.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.379
Now, listen to me, if anything
is missing or broken,

26:55.381 --> 26:56.947
It comes out of your paycheck.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.782
Now, you go outside.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.651
And you wait for me there.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.986
Yes, sir.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.094
You weren't supposed to
be back for four hours.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.629
Sorry, man.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.897
Who were all these people?

27:13.899 --> 27:16.000
Well, when your team started
calling my old friends,

27:16.002 --> 27:18.135
They started calling me.
(laughs)

27:18.137 --> 27:19.937
But this wasn't for myself.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.805
Oh, no. Another charity?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.240
No, no, no.
It's for, it's for denny.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.242
I-I-I wanted to go out.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.977
Show the kid some fun.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.279
He's really uptight, man.
Okay.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.314
But your agent wouldn't
let me leave, so...

27:30.316 --> 27:31.315
You're telling me

27:31.317 --> 27:32.850
This was for your son?

27:32.852 --> 27:36.920
I figured I ought to get
to know him a little. You know?

27:36.922 --> 27:38.989
I mean, I missed
his entire life.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.859
Chasing my dream.
(laughs)

27:41.861 --> 27:43.227
Ah, I'm sure you can't relate.

27:43.229 --> 27:46.096
I mean,
you're not a parent.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.098
No.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.900
But I have one.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.235
Now, look.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.003
If you want to relate
to your son,

27:53.005 --> 27:54.738
You don't have to do all this.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.840
You just have to sit down
and talk to him.

27:56.842 --> 28:00.277
(retching nearby)

28:00.279 --> 28:02.146
Denny:
Oh, god. Oh, god.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.247
Who's that?

28:03.249 --> 28:04.381
My son.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.250
Quite the lightweight.
(laughs)

28:06.252 --> 28:08.385
Is he throwing up
in my bathroom?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.754
No! No, no.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.290
Don't worry, I'll clean it up.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.059
Oh, no, no, no!
That is...

28:15.061 --> 28:17.861
These are egyptian cotton,
400-thread-count towels.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.130
I got a special recipe
for stains, man.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.032
It's magic, you should've seen
the first room

28:22.034 --> 28:23.734
They had me in
at the hcf concert.

28:23.736 --> 28:27.204
Did you say
<i>first</i> dressing room?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.073
Yeah.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.141
(woman singing off-key)

28:34.279 --> 28:37.281
Woman (off-key):
♪ I'm fine on my own.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.084
Mcgee: Oof.
Man: Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!

28:40.086 --> 28:41.785
I thought I was a bad singer.
You'll never make a million
dollars with that voice.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.788
You know how you can make
a million bucks singing?

28:44.790 --> 28:47.124
(woman crying)
start with 2 million!

28:47.126 --> 28:50.260
Huh? Ee...

28:50.262 --> 28:52.062
(sputters)

28:52.064 --> 28:54.998
Sorry, I got my fill
of sonny and cher impersonators.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.067
Excuse me, we're
not here to audition.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.136
We're from ncis.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.905
We need to ask you a few
questions about manheim gold.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.443
(mustard grunts)
bishop: Hey!

29:06.445 --> 29:08.979
(bishop grunts)

29:08.981 --> 29:12.149
I got you, babe!

29:12.151 --> 29:13.484
Nice.

29:13.486 --> 29:16.186
Mcgee:
<i>Look, we know you did it.</i>

29:16.188 --> 29:18.288
We've traced the brake fluid
back to the scene of the crime.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.759
We've got two eyewitnesses that
put you under manheim's car.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.393
See, right about now,
your stomach is

29:23.395 --> 29:25.229
Dropping through the floor.

29:25.231 --> 29:28.365
One half your brain realizes
that you're going to jail.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.167
The other half is in denial.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.402
I'm dying to see
which half's gonna win.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.205
I've been to the joint.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.240
I can't go back.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.941
Then make me smile.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.910
And I'll tell the prosecutor
you cooperated.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.545
Oh, rat turd. Okay.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.915
Look, um, manheim never

29:44.917 --> 29:46.416
Hit it big in the states.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.519
But for some reason,
he was quite popular

29:48.521 --> 29:51.355
In equatorial guinea.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.192
Once he went into rehab,

29:55.194 --> 29:57.895
The royalties
started coming in.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.496
Not a lot,
just enough to live on.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.931
And you didn't tell manheim this

30:00.933 --> 30:02.266
When he got out of rehab?

30:02.268 --> 30:04.935
Must've slipped my mind.

30:06.271 --> 30:10.040
So, now that manheim
is mounting a comeback,

30:10.042 --> 30:11.909
You're worried he's gonna
find out about his royalties.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.510
So you tried to kill him.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.579
You... You make it sound
a lot worse than it is.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.414
Oh, I am?

30:17.416 --> 30:20.417
'cause you bomb you planted
killed two innocent people.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.586
Bomb?

30:25.223 --> 30:26.990
(over intercom):
I'm being railroaded!

30:26.992 --> 30:29.293
I-I didn't plant a bomb!

30:29.295 --> 30:30.994
I want a lawyer!

30:30.996 --> 30:32.462
I'm thirsty!

30:32.464 --> 30:33.463
What do you think?
I'm hungry!

30:33.465 --> 30:35.098
I think I have a headache.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.300
I want representation!

30:36.302 --> 30:38.001
I've seen movies!

30:38.003 --> 30:39.303
(turns off intercom)

30:39.305 --> 30:40.604
Guy claims he's
got an alibi.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.306
Yeah? Run it down.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.074
(door opens)
well, what if it holds?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.376
That means manheim has
two people trying to kill him.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.344
Tony: No.
(door closes)

30:47.346 --> 30:48.512
Just one.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.380
I found out
manheim switched rooms

30:50.382 --> 30:51.615
Two days before the blast.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.550
He was complaining that
his first dressing room

30:53.552 --> 30:54.985
Smelled like vomit.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.086
"two days"?

30:56.088 --> 30:57.087
Abby said that the bomb was

30:57.089 --> 30:59.189
Put in place a week ago.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.058
And since
no one could've known

31:01.060 --> 31:03.360
Manheim was gonna
change rooms...

31:03.362 --> 31:04.995
He couldn't have
been the target.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.607
Mcgee:
Well, mustard's alibi
checks out.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.475
He didn't plant the bomb.
And why would he?

31:18.477 --> 31:20.878
Manheim wasn't even supposed
to be in that room.
Who was?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.080
Bishop:
Nobody.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.048
That was tony.
With manheim cleared,

31:25.050 --> 31:27.284
They made it to the base just
in time to do a sound check.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.419
The coordinator said manheim's
second dressing room is actually

31:29.421 --> 31:31.622
A stage-prop storage room.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.624
Well, why didn't the coordinator
tell us that earlier?

31:33.626 --> 31:35.893
Good question.
I have another one.

31:35.895 --> 31:38.896
If this wasn't
a murder attempt, what was it?

31:38.898 --> 31:40.163
Terrorism?
Mm...

31:40.165 --> 31:41.398
Terrorists would have
planted a bomb

31:41.400 --> 31:43.133
In the audience, not backstage.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.202
Mcgee:
You know, maybe someone wanted
to shut down the concert

31:45.204 --> 31:48.538
Didn't tony mention that manheim
has serious stage fright?

31:48.540 --> 31:50.173
Bad enough to bomb his own show?

31:50.175 --> 31:51.508
(phone ringing)

31:51.510 --> 31:52.976
Hey, abby. What's...?

31:52.978 --> 31:54.511
Oh, no.
That's great news. Okay.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.413
Yeah, I'll be...
I'll be right there.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.548
Okay, thanks. Bye. So,
you may not know this, but...

31:58.550 --> 31:59.983
Tell me on the way.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.418
A fingerprint's ridge--

32:01.420 --> 32:03.253
If you put it on this
little plastic box...

32:03.255 --> 32:05.555
So, then, I thought abby could
use my friends' algorithm

32:05.557 --> 32:07.491
To reconstruct the
original partial print

32:07.493 --> 32:09.026
Using a line-integral
convolution.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.561
Sounds like it worked.
Pretty cool, huh?

32:11.563 --> 32:12.996
Are you still
talking to me?

32:12.998 --> 32:14.398
What bishop was trying
to say is,

32:14.400 --> 32:15.565
We got a partial from the bomb.

32:15.567 --> 32:19.569
It was too partial-y
for a search, but

32:19.571 --> 32:25.108
You add in a little magical nsa
wizard math fix-it, and voilà.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.411
You got a hit.
Yup, the print
from the bomb

32:27.413 --> 32:30.480
Belongs to...
Luke pischedda.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.516
The hcf concert
coordinator?

32:32.518 --> 32:35.986
More like concert destroyer. The
guy almost ruined his own show.

32:35.988 --> 32:39.256
No, he didn't.
He knew the concert
would be moved to pax river.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.091
He probably made
the contingency plans himself!

32:41.093 --> 32:42.459
Abby:
So, you think he's

32:42.461 --> 32:44.294
Planning some sort
of attack at the base?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.430
Gibbs, this concert
starts, like, now!

32:46.432 --> 32:48.565
Thanks, abbs.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.001
No, no, no.
That's your go cue.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.602
That means you go.
It's go time.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.571
Okay.
Go, go get 'em.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.712
Jimmy,

33:01.714 --> 33:04.114
Why aren't you
at the hospital?

33:05.016 --> 33:06.316
Did something happen
to your baby?

33:06.318 --> 33:07.751
No, the...

33:07.753 --> 33:09.319
The baby's fine.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.388
He's just not, um...

33:14.325 --> 33:16.994
The mom decided
that, uh...

33:16.996 --> 33:18.695
She's gonna
keep him.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.500
(sniffles)
abby.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.737
(crying quietly)

33:26.739 --> 33:27.771
Tony:
<i>You can do this.</i>

33:27.773 --> 33:29.406
<i>You can totally do this,</i>

33:29.408 --> 33:31.141
And you will be fine.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.143
Besides, nobody's
here to see you.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.345
They're here for
the free concert.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.180
Thanks.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.082
(phone ringing)

33:42.553 --> 33:45.255
Very special agent
anthony dinozzo.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.024
You seen pischedda?

33:47.026 --> 33:48.258
No. He disappeared
about five minutes ago.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.726
Bishop:
He planted the bomb.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.128
Pischedda?
You're sure it's him?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.195
Abby's sure.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.597
We should stop the concert.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.265
Evacuate everybody.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.234
No. No, not yet.
There could be
another bomb.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.802
If we evacuate,
pischedda could detonate.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.104
I'm very near
that hypothetical bomb.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.439
How long are we gonna
keep this quiet?

34:02.441 --> 34:04.274
Gibbs:
Till we figure out
what he wants.

34:04.276 --> 34:05.709
You find him!

34:05.711 --> 34:07.711
And when you do,
you make him talk.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.280
Understood.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.516
Mcgee:
Boss, I think
I got something, here.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.152
Prior to the hcf, pischedda
worked as a contractor

34:15.154 --> 34:16.253
For a private
military company.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.554
Something stand out, mcgee?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.056
Mcgee:
A job he did in 2003.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.458
They helped transport
$2 billion in cash

34:21.460 --> 34:22.759
To iraq during
reconstruction.

34:22.761 --> 34:23.827
How do you
transport

34:23.829 --> 34:25.629
$2 billion in cash?

34:25.631 --> 34:27.230
In hundred dollar bills,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.066
Shrink-wrapped
and loaded onto pallets.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.801
Then flown off
into cargo planes.
Great.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.135
How much
didn't make it?

34:32.137 --> 34:33.837
Hundreds of millions
went missing.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.173
And, boss, some of that money
flew out of pax river,

34:36.175 --> 34:37.207
From the same complex

34:37.209 --> 34:38.742
The concert's in now.

34:40.611 --> 34:43.246
(indistinct chattering)

34:45.149 --> 34:47.717
Where you been, man?
What?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.152
Remember you said
I could do this?

34:49.154 --> 34:51.154
I can't do this.

34:51.156 --> 34:52.289
Look at all those
people out there.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.158
Come on, let's get you ready.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.460
Gibbs:
Hey, dinozzo.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.498
Nobody's seen pischedda,
but three stagehands
are missing,

35:01.500 --> 35:03.533
So what are we gonna do?
Pull the alarm?
Gibbs:
No.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.535
It's not a terrorist attack.
This is a heist.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.703
Bishop:
Pischedda hid the
money on the base.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.171
He's using the charity concert

35:08.173 --> 35:09.206
As cover to get it out.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.308
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen

35:11.310 --> 35:13.477
Of the United States
armed forces...
We can't let anyone know.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.312
We don't know who
else is involved.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.214
Bishop:
And pischedda may have
rigged more explosives

35:17.216 --> 35:18.181
In case things go south.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.217
He needs to
think that

35:20.219 --> 35:21.751
Everything is going
according to plan.
Tony:
Yeah...

35:21.753 --> 35:23.520
That may be a little
bit of a problem.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.688
Announcer:
...Manheim gold!

35:24.690 --> 35:26.556
(rock intro plays)

35:26.558 --> 35:28.391
♪

35:30.361 --> 35:32.829
What's he doing?
Well, he may be
wetting his pants.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.431
He needs to get on stage.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.266
Gibbs:
Hey!

35:36.268 --> 35:37.567
Now, dinozzo.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.704
Mcgee...

35:41.839 --> 35:43.440
Let's go.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.175
Announcer:
And, ladies and gentlemen,

35:45.177 --> 35:48.512
Let's give a round of applause
for manheim gold!

35:48.514 --> 35:50.747
Long story short, I need you
to get out there and play.

35:50.749 --> 35:51.915
My hands are frozen, man.
Okay.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.650
It's kind of
a law enforcement issue.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.918
Look.
Manheim...

35:54.920 --> 35:57.354
You barely need your hands.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.289
The song has, what,
three chords?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.423
That's harsh, man.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.791
And the song has four chords.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.693
Warm 'em up.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.929
Crowd (chanting):
Manheim! Manheim! Manheim!

36:05.931 --> 36:08.298
Okay, give me a five count.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.866
(microphone feedback)

36:09.868 --> 36:12.469
Tony:
Ladies and gentlemen,
how you doing out there?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.604
Look at that.
Handsome group of people.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.306
Mcgee, give me a sitrep.

36:16.308 --> 36:19.176
No sign yet. Agents holgate
and dearborn just arrived.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.477
They're covering
the south side.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.812
All right, tell them
to stick to this complex.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.948
Keep me posted.
What if the money's not here?

36:24.950 --> 36:26.883
It's here. Come on.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.618
...The evening's
star attraction...

36:28.620 --> 36:32.622
Just moments away.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.325
This is a man

36:35.327 --> 36:37.561
Who's ready to start
having a life.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.629
Manheim.
The man of gold.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.265
Manheim gold!

36:42.267 --> 36:43.533
(applause and cheering)

36:43.535 --> 36:46.336

Pischedda had access

Through his

37:47.699 --> 37:49.366
Wow.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.703
(music stops,
crowd exclaiming in distance)

37:53.705 --> 37:55.705
I have no idea
what's going on, but...
Shh!

Luke:
Hurry up, guys,
let's go.

38:25.903 --> 38:28.538
This is way better
than sitting in a cubicle.

Jimmy:
<i>So how much money</i>
<i>did they recover?</i>

38:34.079 --> 38:36.079
$10 million.
The bad guys took the money

38:36.081 --> 38:37.814
From the hangar and buried it.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.549
When they went
to go retrieve it,

38:39.551 --> 38:41.551
The complex had been expanded,

38:41.553 --> 38:44.421
So the money
was trapped underneath

38:44.423 --> 38:46.356
A newly-poured
concrete slab.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.390
Pischedda must
have taken years

38:47.392 --> 38:48.525
Trying to
figure out

38:48.527 --> 38:50.327
How to get it out.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.895
And then even longer
climbing his way

38:51.897 --> 38:54.664
Up the hcf charity.
Look...

Yeah, she, uh...

39:26.732 --> 39:28.965
She saw the baby
and just...

39:30.735 --> 39:33.737
I guess she felt the same way
we felt when we first saw him.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.674
Can't fault her
for that, right?

39:39.944 --> 39:41.611
Why don't you go home?

39:41.613 --> 39:44.381
I will. Yeah, breena and I,
we just wanted

39:44.383 --> 39:46.683
To get all this stuff
out of the house, you know?

39:46.685 --> 39:48.785
We wanted to give it back
as soon as possible.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.520
We?

39:51.589 --> 39:52.922
Me.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.459
She's hurting, too, but, uh...

39:56.461 --> 39:58.461
She is so much stronger.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.031
She's ready to try again.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.600
And, uh, and me...

40:12.877 --> 40:14.844
I feel like
I can't breathe.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.720
I've never felt this bad
in my life, gibbs.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.122
Ah, just wait until
it's 3:00 in the morning

40:26.124 --> 40:27.991
And your kid's running a 104.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.629
You're just getting started.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.531
That's the point,
I'm not starting.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.966
You know? And...

40:36.968 --> 40:38.535
Maybe I never will.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.837
Well, then,
fight for it, palmer.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.505
That's what you do,

40:42.507 --> 40:43.706
You fight for
your family.

40:43.708 --> 40:44.974
And sometimes

40:44.976 --> 40:47.444
You fight like hell
just to have one.

40:48.979 --> 40:50.580
You want me to fight?

40:50.582 --> 40:52.449
I feel like I just went
ten rounds with joe louis.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.584
Do you want to be
a dad, palmer?

40:54.586 --> 40:56.686
Because, right now,
this is being a dad.

40:56.688 --> 40:57.754
Maybe I'm not ready.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.858
You wouldn't feel
the way you feel right now

41:01.860 --> 41:03.927
