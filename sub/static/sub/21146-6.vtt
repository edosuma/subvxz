WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:05.382
We pay $5,000 per unit.

00:05.465 --> 00:08.510
However, if you're willing
to give more than 10%,

00:08.593 --> 00:10.387
purchase price doubles.

00:10.470 --> 00:13.473
Payment is made in full
on the day of removal.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.434
There's also a standard
confidentiality clause.

00:16.810 --> 00:19.813
That's detailed on page seven of the release.

00:20.355 --> 00:22.399
Do you have any questions?

00:23.483 --> 00:25.360
Yes.

00:25.443 --> 00:26.861
Will it hurt?

00:26.945 --> 00:28.238
I told you, don't worry about that.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.073
I'm allowed to worry.

00:30.156 --> 00:31.825
I'm your wife.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.494
The procedure itself doesn't hurt.

00:34.577 --> 00:38.790
Some donors complain of fatigue
accompanied by minor headaches.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.292
Nothing that a few aspirin won't fix.

00:41.418 --> 00:45.380
Yes, but, will he be...

00:45.463 --> 00:46.631
The long-term effects?

00:47.632 --> 00:49.426
Yeah, a common question.

00:50.468 --> 00:53.430
The simple answer, as far as we can tell,

00:53.513 --> 00:55.348
based on, now, thousands of clinical trials,

00:55.432 --> 00:57.225
is there aren't any.

00:59.686 --> 01:02.480
But would you like some more time
to think it over?

01:03.148 --> 01:04.899
We don't have time.

01:05.859 --> 01:07.902
The mortgage company
is breathing down our backs,

01:07.986 --> 01:10.238
and your sister's not gonna
bail us out this time.

01:12.866 --> 01:16.077
Look, what about 10%? Is that enough?

01:16.286 --> 01:17.829
Absolutely.

01:18.955 --> 01:22.876
But remember, 15 is double the price.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.505
Trust me.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.382
You won't even miss it.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.131
Ready?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.267
Be as still as possible.

02:59.389 --> 03:00.431
We're done.

03:10.275 --> 03:14.279
I gave him a mild sedative,
so he should sleep through the night.

03:58.990 --> 03:59.991
Three.

04:00.533 --> 04:01.534
You got it.

04:07.332 --> 04:09.000
Yeah. Here you go. Thank you.

04:27.769 --> 04:29.938
I started to have second thoughts,

04:31.481 --> 04:34.442
and then I had second thoughts
about the second thoughts.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.159
Millie? Look who's here.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.458
Millie?

04:51.584 --> 04:53.336
Are you ready, hon?

05:06.057 --> 05:08.476
Now, I need something
that belongs to Mildred

05:08.559 --> 05:11.062
so that I can confirm this is a match.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.487
Thank you.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.076
Good. It's close enough.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.413
What now?

05:29.247 --> 05:31.666
Now
we turn it into a consumable.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.893
Okay, Mildred.

05:50.977 --> 05:52.895
Can you do this for me?

05:53.146 --> 05:54.397
Say "ah..."

05:54.981 --> 05:56.024
Ah...

05:56.107 --> 05:57.150
Very good.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.154
Sweetheart.

06:02.488 --> 06:03.698
How do you feel?

06:08.995 --> 06:10.246
Richard?

08:20.459 --> 08:21.711
Let me help you out.

08:21.919 --> 08:25.256
The first bunny ear,
he meets the second bunny ear.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.551
Over, round...

08:35.266 --> 08:36.434
All right.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.520
All right.

09:01.918 --> 09:02.960
What's up with him?

09:03.586 --> 09:04.962
He's French.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.465
What are we having here then?

09:07.882 --> 09:10.760
Reddi-wip, marshmallows,
hot fudge. My God!

09:10.843 --> 09:12.553
First one's for you.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.555
Well, I'm bloody honored.

09:14.639 --> 09:15.681
You're cooking.

09:15.765 --> 09:17.141
Yeah. So?

09:17.558 --> 09:19.185
So, nothing.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.353
I love your cooking.

09:20.436 --> 09:21.604
Get the fire extinguisher.

09:21.687 --> 09:22.730
Funny.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.024
Now you get to set the table.

09:28.486 --> 09:31.030
So, listen,
I wanna talk to you about yesterday.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.198
Yeah?

09:33.157 --> 09:36.244
Look. You know what I mean.
I know we both said some things there...

09:37.119 --> 09:38.287
"Said some things," honestly,

09:38.371 --> 09:40.414
it sounds like a bloody lover's quarrel.

09:40.498 --> 09:41.999
Look, what I'm trying to tell you

09:42.083 --> 09:44.877
is I can be a real bastard
without even trying and I'm sorry.

09:44.961 --> 09:46.003
All right?

09:47.213 --> 09:48.381
Don't worry about it.

09:48.923 --> 09:50.007
Yeah?

09:52.051 --> 09:53.469
That's good.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.347
You got anything you wanna say to me?

10:00.309 --> 10:01.310
You're forgiven.

10:03.521 --> 10:04.563
So...

10:06.774 --> 10:07.817
What are we doing today?

10:07.900 --> 10:09.360
I've heard there's this place in the Quarter

10:09.443 --> 10:11.112
where they shoot you in the chest for money.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.738
I think that might be fun.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.198
- What?
- Yeah.

10:14.282 --> 10:15.449
You wear a vest and that. It's a game.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.785
Where they pay you to get shot in the chest?

10:17.868 --> 10:19.954
Yeah, or you pay them.
That part was unclear.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.249
Well, we could get shot in the chest
for unclear reasons,

10:23.374 --> 10:27.169
or we could do what we came to do
in the first place and look for God.

10:28.087 --> 10:30.339
Where exactly in the Quarter was this, Cass?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.634
All right. Searching for God it is then.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.985
There's a bunch of jazz clubs left.
We could hit those.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.486
- More marshmallow?
- No, no.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.780
Let's let the diabetes
take its own time, shall we?

10:54.905 --> 10:56.866
Or the crypto-fascists Lara told me about.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.117
The men in the white suits.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.202
I'm telling you now,
when it comes to crypto-fascists,

11:00.286 --> 11:02.330
the Reptilians,
they're gonna be way more likely.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.831
Who's Lara?

11:03.914 --> 11:05.624
- This lounge singer I met.
- Mmm...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.752
Lara, the lounge singer.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.004
That's right, I remember now.
You were quite excited about her.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.547
No, I wasn't.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.883
Yes, you were. You come in all flustered-like.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.010
No, I was excited by the lead she gave me.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.094
Not her.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.387
Mmm.

11:25.353 --> 11:26.354
I wasn't being defensive.

11:26.437 --> 11:27.396
She was in trouble. I helped her.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.606
- That's it.
- Okay, good.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.358
Now the God audition seems like a dead end.

11:30.441 --> 11:31.650
All we have is a hand shooting a gun.

11:31.734 --> 11:32.693
So, good to find out

11:32.777 --> 11:34.362
- who shot that bloody gun.
- Yeah.

11:34.445 --> 11:35.696
Why don't we just zoom in
on the serial number?

11:35.780 --> 11:37.448
- "Helping's" good.
- It is good.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.866
- What?
- On the gun.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.117
I said it was good.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.369
Zoom in on the serial number

11:41.452 --> 11:42.495
and then trace it back to the owner.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.038
It's always good to give a girl

11:44.121 --> 11:45.539
a good helping whenever you can.

11:45.623 --> 11:46.707
Just like they do in the shows, and that.

11:46.791 --> 11:49.085
I couldn't agree with you more.
What are you talking about?

11:49.168 --> 11:51.504
I'm talking about zooming in on the
gun to find out who shot it.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.464
- You just zoom in, then you...
- Okay. Seriously.

11:54.507 --> 11:56.300
What the hell happened
with you and this girl?

11:57.843 --> 11:59.804
I didn't marry her, Tulip.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.222
I'll tell you that much.

12:10.815 --> 12:12.149
Which one?

12:21.492 --> 12:22.743
Tell me.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.333
That one.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.989
Don't make me shoot you, man.

13:02.450 --> 13:03.534
I'll do it.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.037
I swear.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.873
I'll do it.

13:17.715 --> 13:18.924
Where's the Preacher?

13:19.008 --> 13:20.676
Ain't no preacher here, man.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.052
I'm a Jew!

13:25.264 --> 13:27.141
You know, zoom in, resolve.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.893
"Hold on. Is that a clue there?"

13:28.976 --> 13:30.311
You know, like they do in the shows.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.395
Hmm.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.368
Preacher?

13:46.452 --> 13:47.495
Are you serious, man?

13:47.578 --> 13:49.580
No!

13:49.663 --> 13:50.706
Don't make me bust you up!

14:06.680 --> 14:10.809
When you say "the shows,"
you mean TV shows that take place,

14:10.935 --> 14:13.437
say, in outer space or the Pentagon?

14:13.521 --> 14:14.897
Yeah, but we don't do any of that.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.524
We take the tapes down to the Circuit Works,

14:16.607 --> 14:19.235
and we let the Dork Docs
do all the bloody faffing about

14:19.318 --> 14:22.196
with their technicological software, and that.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.073
- That so, huh?
- Yeah.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.866
Just love me TV shows, all right?

14:25.950 --> 14:27.493
Which shows do you watch, exactly?

14:27.743 --> 14:31.121
I love 'em all.
High-school shows, law shows, love them.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.290
Love serial killers and stuff like that.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.125
Terrorist attacks, comedians.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.627
I love reality TV,

14:36.710 --> 14:38.254
you know, like eejits just riding

14:38.379 --> 14:39.880
around the world on motorcycles,

14:39.964 --> 14:41.382
and fat women looking for prizes.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.841
So basically, you watch trash TV.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.719
I do not
just basically watch trash TV at all.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.596
It's really... You get a survey

14:47.721 --> 14:49.515
on the human experience, all right?

14:49.598 --> 14:53.269
Watching those fat ladies transform
is a beautiful thing, it's wonderful.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.271
Then they finally learn to love themselves,

14:55.354 --> 14:58.065
and sometimes the producers even pay
to get rid of their stretch marks.

14:58.691 --> 15:01.151
You really ought to try watching it,
it's very neat.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.320
Hey, guys.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.205
Fiore's dead.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.124
Dead, dead?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.084
Wait. The angel from the casino?

15:59.501 --> 16:01.795
I thought he was, like... He couldn't die.

16:01.879 --> 16:02.880
I guess not.

16:03.088 --> 16:06.884
Apparently a cowboy shot him
and he never came back.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.386
So what do we do now?

16:09.511 --> 16:11.764
What, about the indestructible angel killer?

16:11.889 --> 16:13.557
I think it's pretty clear that we run.

16:14.058 --> 16:15.601
We can't run forever.

16:15.726 --> 16:16.977
He'll just keep finding us.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.312
Unless you stop using

16:19.396 --> 16:20.481
the power.

16:21.357 --> 16:23.150
That's how he keeps tracking us, right?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.152
No, I need that to help me find God.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.363
Well, I don't know what then.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.781
Why doesn't the Word work on him?

16:28.864 --> 16:31.116
It works on everyone else.
It works on angels, people.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.326
It works on Cassidy.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.661
It does, that.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.871
The Saint made a deal with the angel.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.499
Something he could get,
something he wanted

16:38.582 --> 16:41.085
in exchange for destroying Genesis.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.003
That's his weakness.

16:43.087 --> 16:45.839
Yeah, right. Like Superman has kryptonite,

16:45.923 --> 16:47.633
Spider-Man has his Mary Jane,

16:47.800 --> 16:50.094
we've just gotta find out
what the Saint's weakness is.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.929
Great. Let's do that then.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.931
How exactly do we do that, though?

16:55.599 --> 16:56.600
We read.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.858
Check it out.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.444
I used to drop acid
and flick through these for hours, man.

17:09.780 --> 17:10.781
Uh-huh...

17:13.158 --> 17:14.410
Really?

17:14.660 --> 17:15.786
A book on tape?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.496
Still a book.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.543
<i>Hello.</i>

17:22.626 --> 17:25.921
<i>You're listening to
another edition of</i> American Psychopaths.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.883
<i>Chapter 57, "The Saint of Killers."</i>

17:32.511 --> 17:35.222
<i>Our story begins in 1861.</i>

17:35.639 --> 17:36.974
<i>Our backdrop?</i>

17:37.307 --> 17:38.642
<i>The American Civil War.</i>

17:39.810 --> 17:41.186
<i>Before he was a myth,</i>

17:41.270 --> 17:45.315
<i>our subject was a man
fighting for the Confederate Army.</i>

17:46.024 --> 17:49.361
<i>Some called him heartless. Others, insane.</i>

17:50.487 --> 17:53.741
<i>His compatriots dubbed him
"the Butcher of Gettysburg",</i>

17:54.825 --> 17:56.827
<i>but all wars come to an end.</i>

17:57.202 --> 18:01.457
<i>Until one day, as fate would have it,
he fell in love.</i>

18:03.208 --> 18:07.045
<i>She hailed from Laredo,
a Christian girl of German descent.</i>

18:08.046 --> 18:10.090
<i>It wasn't long till they were wed,</i>

18:10.174 --> 18:13.010
<i>and sooner still, she gave him a daughter.</i>

18:14.553 --> 18:17.765
<i>And for a time, the cowboy was at peace.</i>

18:21.685 --> 18:23.937
<i>But fortune favors the wind.</i>

18:24.021 --> 18:27.775
<i>The cowboy lost his wife
and daughter to disease.</i>

18:29.276 --> 18:31.737
<i>Legend says that in that moment,</i>

18:31.820 --> 18:34.698
<i>his soul shattered into a million pieces,</i>

18:34.782 --> 18:37.910
<i>scattering to the four corners of the Earth.</i>

18:38.702 --> 18:42.039
<i>Hate became the blood
coursing through his veins.</i>

18:42.748 --> 18:45.667
<i>The only living man without a soul.</i>

18:46.502 --> 18:47.878
<i>On that fateful day,</i>

18:47.961 --> 18:53.634
<i>the cowboy became
the grim, taciturn, implacable killing machine</i>

18:53.717 --> 18:57.346
<i>known commonly as the Saint of Killers.</i>

18:57.888 --> 18:59.556
<i>But our story doesn't end here.</i>

19:01.225 --> 19:04.561
<i>The Saint sought bloody revenge
on the town of Ratwater,</i>

19:06.897 --> 19:11.819
<i>dying there in the famous tornado of 1881.</i>

19:11.902 --> 19:15.405
<i>But soulless men have no place in Paradise,</i>

19:15.906 --> 19:18.659
<i>and God banished him to the netherworld,</i>

19:18.742 --> 19:23.038
<i>imprisoned and forced to relive
his most injurious memory</i>

19:23.121 --> 19:26.917
<i>over, and over, and over again.</i>

19:27.000 --> 19:30.838
<i>It's there he rots,
the most hated man in Heaven,</i>

19:30.921 --> 19:33.257
<i>the most dreaded in Hell,</i>

19:33.340 --> 19:36.593
<i>rumored to be feared by Satan himself.</i>

19:43.892 --> 19:47.396
<i>We hope you enjoyed this edition
of</i> American Psychopaths.

19:47.479 --> 19:51.483
<i>Join us next time
for Chapter 58, "Dick Cheney."</i>

19:51.567 --> 19:53.527
All right, weaknesses.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.237
I'm gonna start.

19:56.446 --> 20:00.325
He's not very well-liked,
which is a weakness of a sort.

20:00.409 --> 20:05.289
He is also a vicious,
child-murdering maniac with no soul.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.040
Although in this case,

20:07.124 --> 20:08.750
you know, that might be a strength.
I don't know.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.294
He lost his family.

20:11.128 --> 20:15.299
Now, I don't know
if that's a weakness so much as a...

20:16.216 --> 20:17.593
A thing that happened.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.930
- You know what?
- Holy mother of bleeding shite!

20:22.431 --> 20:23.682
I forgot about Denis.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.238
<i>Denis! Denis,
don't go back to the apartment!</i>

20:38.322 --> 20:39.448
Cassidy?

20:39.531 --> 20:40.991
<i>Denis, listen to me...</i>

20:41.074 --> 20:43.911
<i>There's an intruder! Do you hear me?</i>

20:43.994 --> 20:44.995
<i>Intruder!</i>

20:45.871 --> 20:47.039
<i>Bloody hell!</i>

20:47.122 --> 20:48.498
<i>Don't open that door!</i>

20:50.208 --> 20:52.085
Shut your French mouth! Listen to me!

20:52.169 --> 20:53.420
Don't open the door.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.967
Intruder, Denis! Death!

20:59.051 --> 21:00.052
<i>Christ!</i>

21:03.430 --> 21:04.431
<i>Intruder, Denis!</i>

21:16.068 --> 21:17.110
It's too late.

21:17.945 --> 21:19.237
Give me the phone.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.366
I'm here.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.620
<i>I'm here.</i>

21:35.837 --> 21:37.381
Don't hurt him.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.841
I'm coming.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.925
Say your prayers, Preacher.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.096
Kill me and the deal's off.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.975
That's right.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.604
The angel told me about it.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.315
Fiore.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.027
You don't know shit.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.320
Kill me then.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.739
See what happens.

22:43.864 --> 22:44.865
Uh-huh.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.368
That's the idea.

22:49.161 --> 22:51.788
Or see what doesn't happen.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.419
The old man doesn't matter now.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.130
Let him go.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.973
Talk quick before
I lose this bullet in your skull.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.977
You think you're working for God, don't you?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.147
Kill the Preacher,

23:18.065 --> 23:19.941
and God will give you what you want.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.070
'Cause I got some bad news for you.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.323
God ain't giving you shit.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.451
He's gone.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.925
Prove it.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.594
<i>...rest well, my child,</i>

23:49.012 --> 23:50.430
<i>your suffering</i>

23:51.348 --> 23:53.225
<i>is my suffering,</i>

23:55.060 --> 23:57.145
<i>I shall soothe your pain</i>

23:58.230 --> 24:00.899
<i>and dry your tears.</i>

24:04.027 --> 24:05.237
What is this thing?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.531
<i>Your suffering is my suffering.
That just kills me.</i>

24:07.614 --> 24:09.074
That's a television.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.409
That's an actor.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.370
This whole thing's a cover-up.

24:14.913 --> 24:18.208
The real God left us down on Earth
to fend for ourselves.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.751
Where is He?

24:19.876 --> 24:20.877
I don't know.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.339
But I know what you want.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.217
You wanna go to Heaven.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.096
God won't get you there.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.973
<i>...and know the signs of the world to come!</i>

24:33.056 --> 24:34.558
Not anymore.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.186
You leave us alone, I can.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.400
Can you now?

24:44.734 --> 24:47.320
Why did the angels send for you to kill me?

24:47.404 --> 24:48.780
Genesis.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.242
I got a power inside me.

24:53.368 --> 24:54.995
A power that rivals God's.

24:56.121 --> 24:59.624
I can command anyone in the universe
to do my bidding.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.585
I can call upon the angels.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.588
I can send a man to Hell if I want.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.675
I've done it before.

25:10.260 --> 25:13.471
I can send you to Heaven.

25:19.269 --> 25:22.772
Do you know what it takes
to get me to Heaven?

25:23.773 --> 25:25.317
What I need?

25:27.068 --> 25:28.612
And you can get that?

25:32.407 --> 25:33.617
Where?

25:35.869 --> 25:37.162
Nice try.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.833
You're going to have to trust me.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.213
I know it's not a great deal, but...

25:47.589 --> 25:48.673
It's the only deal you got.

25:48.757 --> 25:49.966
<i>Yes!</i>

25:56.598 --> 25:58.016
You got one hour.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.312
One hour.

26:03.939 --> 26:05.523
One more thing...

26:17.077 --> 26:18.495
What happened?

26:18.578 --> 26:20.247
He took the deal.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.167
But you have to stay.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.378
All three of you.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.303
What about you?

26:36.429 --> 26:38.056
I have to go get him something.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.599
What?

26:42.310 --> 26:43.561
A soul.

26:44.729 --> 26:45.897
Upstairs.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.570
- How the heck are you gonna...
- It's all right.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.573
I can do it.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.367
Now.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.708
Come on, Denis.

27:12.215 --> 27:13.633
One hour, Preacher.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.980
Afternoon, Father.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.690
Pick up for the Monsignor?

27:29.774 --> 27:33.111
Rub in twice a day on the infected area.
He'll be fine.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.779
I don't know the Monsignor.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.823
I need a soul. To buy.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.033
From you. Right now.

27:38.116 --> 27:39.659
No idea what you're talking about.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.244
No?

27:41.328 --> 27:43.163
You have a set of pull needles right there.

27:44.372 --> 27:45.832
Somewhere else in here you got

27:45.915 --> 27:49.961
an uprooter, a pump, a scale and a spinner.

27:51.129 --> 27:54.174
Papa Bebe's been selling souls
for over 150 years.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.385
So you know exactly what I'm talking about.

27:57.469 --> 27:58.803
Who the hell are you?

28:01.473 --> 28:03.141
I'm Jesse L'Angelle.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.984
I'm gonna need a match for this.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.277
Something exotic probably.

28:14.444 --> 28:15.528
I'll say.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.156
I don't have much time,
so I need to see the inventory.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.409
Brother, I don't have any inventory.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.620
- What you talking about?
- I was pushed out.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.246
Haven't sold a soul in almost 10 years.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.331
Pushed out by who?

28:26.414 --> 28:28.875
- The mother-loving Japanese.
- The...

28:28.958 --> 28:31.419
These Land of the Rising sons of bitches

28:31.503 --> 28:33.630
went high-tech, high-volume, fractional.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.465
Fractions? Of souls?

28:35.548 --> 28:36.716
Making a killing, too.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.387
Brainy little bastards
came up with all sorts of applications for it.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.222
Pretty much cornered the market.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.265
- What about Normeana's?
- Pushed 'em out, too.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.101
Scratchy's?

28:46.184 --> 28:50.105
Miss Julie's, Black Lake Emporio,
Little John's Voodoo,

28:50.188 --> 28:51.606
Mother Kuberday's.

28:51.689 --> 28:52.982
They buried us all.

28:54.818 --> 28:55.944
Angelville?

28:56.152 --> 28:57.320
Hanging on by a thread.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.866
There has to be some other way.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.077
There has to be.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.290
Well, speak of the devils and they appear.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.167
Time for their boudin sausages.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.254
5:15, like clockwork.

29:14.671 --> 29:16.214
Freakin' robots.

29:20.176 --> 29:24.764
TAMASHII URESHII IKU IKU
SOUL HAPPY GO GO

29:24.848 --> 29:25.932
That's the Japanese?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.809
Small world, ain't it?

29:27.892 --> 29:29.060
Too small if you ask me.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.187
There are souls on that truck?

29:31.688 --> 29:32.730
Yep.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.732
Yours for the taking,
if you got, like, a bajillion dollars.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.453
<i>Could the avocado toast be the brunch...</i>

29:48.413 --> 29:49.414
Hey.

29:49.706 --> 29:52.876
<i>...further explore
this topic, I'm joined by Professor...</i>

29:53.751 --> 29:55.295
Open the door.

30:03.261 --> 30:04.262
Hey.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.389
<i>Just wondering how it was all going.</i>

30:06.806 --> 30:07.891
You close?

30:09.476 --> 30:12.061
Yep, I'd say I'm pretty close.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.022
<i>Okay, 'cause...</i>

30:15.356 --> 30:16.733
Denis is pretty sick.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.110
<i>He doesn't have his medicine.</i>

30:19.402 --> 30:20.570
<i>Jesse?</i>

30:20.862 --> 30:22.864
<i>- You still there?</i>
- Yeah, that's great.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.532
<i>Hey, while I have you...</i>

30:24.699 --> 30:26.743
Any idea how to break
into an armored truck?

30:26.868 --> 30:28.369
<i>What? Where are you?</i>

30:28.453 --> 30:29.954
I'm trying to break into an armored truck.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.290
- What?
- I'll explain when I get home.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.085
Okay, uh...

30:36.753 --> 30:41.132
Do you got...
Okay, you got any D batteries on you?

30:41.341 --> 30:42.675
- No.
<i>- Phone line?</i>

30:42.884 --> 30:44.552
- Nope.
- Burner phone?

30:44.636 --> 30:47.805
Plastic Dixie cups? A bag of lawn fertilizer?

30:47.889 --> 30:51.017
I'm standing on the street
in the middle of the Bywater, Tulip.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.769
I don't have lawn fertilizer.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.273
But I can get some.

31:05.782 --> 31:06.741
Now what?

31:06.824 --> 31:07.825
Now I'd get back.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.721
I'll call you back.

31:32.559 --> 31:33.643
He's gonna call back.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.110
All the time in the world,
and I never learned how to speak French.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.239
He's your dad, isn't he?

31:48.074 --> 31:49.367
Your uncle or something?

31:51.452 --> 31:52.829
No.

31:54.497 --> 31:55.999
He's my son.

31:57.792 --> 31:58.835
No way.

32:00.670 --> 32:01.713
Way.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.133
Hard luck, uh?

32:08.344 --> 32:10.096
Having me for a da.

32:17.478 --> 32:18.938
Tulip? Tulip?

32:26.904 --> 32:28.114
He's sick.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.118
The old man.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.913
Cassidy's son.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.294
He needs medicine, so let him go.

32:46.633 --> 32:47.675
Look...

32:48.259 --> 32:50.803
You'll still have the two of us,

32:50.887 --> 32:52.680
so I really don't see why not.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.364
I read about your little girl.

33:14.911 --> 33:15.912
What would you do if it was...

33:23.920 --> 33:28.132
Preacher's not here by 6:00,
medicine won't help.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.819
Are you all right?

33:49.570 --> 33:50.947
He, um...

33:54.158 --> 33:55.618
He touched me.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.127
Tell 'em to open up.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.260
Hurry up!

34:19.892 --> 34:21.644
I need a soul that matches this bullet.

34:24.439 --> 34:25.481
I don't have this.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.607
No match?

34:27.608 --> 34:28.735
In all of these souls?

34:28.818 --> 34:29.986
This one's rare.

34:30.069 --> 34:31.195
Try it anyway.

34:31.279 --> 34:32.447
Do you know who you're stealing from?

34:32.530 --> 34:33.531
Do it.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.495
None of these match.

34:39.704 --> 34:41.789
I told you. It's rare.

34:41.914 --> 34:45.001
A vault? A storage area?

34:45.084 --> 34:46.085
In Osaka.

34:49.338 --> 34:50.965
What about a soul that doesn't match?

34:51.090 --> 34:53.176
It's like organ donation.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.012
The body would reject,
say, a kidney if it wasn't the right type.

34:56.637 --> 34:57.638
What's your type?

35:09.859 --> 35:10.985
Damn it.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.620
- Hey.
- You get it?

35:20.703 --> 35:21.704
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:22.246 --> 35:23.831
- Almost.
<i>- Almost?</i>

35:26.793 --> 35:27.794
You're not gonna make it, are you?

35:27.919 --> 35:28.920
No, I am. I am.

35:29.337 --> 35:30.379
I'm on my way.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.217
Okay.

35:37.345 --> 35:38.513
See you then.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.735
What about me?

35:54.779 --> 35:56.239
What about my soul?

35:56.364 --> 35:57.990
We could test it if you want to.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.392
What is the least I can give?

36:24.934 --> 36:25.977
1%.

36:29.856 --> 36:31.023
You won't even miss it.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.830
Can't this thing go any faster?

36:45.913 --> 36:46.956
Can't rush it.

36:55.423 --> 36:56.632
Get lost!

37:15.067 --> 37:16.193
Time's up.

37:16.652 --> 37:17.778
Don't!

37:18.195 --> 37:20.156
Wait! Wait, he'll be here!

37:20.615 --> 37:22.241
He'll be here, you moron!

37:35.421 --> 37:36.464
Stop!

37:39.133 --> 37:40.343
I'm here.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.351
- This is ridiculous. Right?
- Nope.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.191
That's a soul?

37:56.359 --> 37:57.360
Mmm-hmm.

37:58.027 --> 38:00.529
How do you know about all this stuff?

38:02.949 --> 38:04.533
Family business.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.204
I gotta get them to a hospital.

38:08.871 --> 38:09.997
You okay?

38:10.206 --> 38:11.207
Mmm-hmm.

38:13.709 --> 38:14.794
You?

38:14.877 --> 38:15.878
I'll be fine.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.507
Hey, come on, Denis.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.386
Come on, son. Let's get you fixed up.

38:48.577 --> 38:49.745
Give it to me.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.129
Where did you get it?

39:01.799 --> 39:03.426
It's yours...

39:04.427 --> 39:05.428
Is it?

39:22.945 --> 39:24.447
Get on your knees.

39:26.699 --> 39:29.618
You're about to enter
the Kingdom of Heaven.

39:30.036 --> 39:32.329
I don't get on my knees for no one.
Not anymore.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.708
I said,
get on your knees!

39:44.133 --> 39:45.843
What did you do?

39:47.636 --> 39:50.723
"The only living man without a soul."

39:51.807 --> 39:54.477
That's why the Word didn't work on you.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.729
You didn't have a soul.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.316
But now...

40:01.025 --> 40:02.818
Now... Drop it!

40:03.569 --> 40:06.655
Disarm. The gun, sabre.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.369
A cop-killing,

40:12.453 --> 40:14.580
child-murdering son of a bitch

40:14.663 --> 40:16.290
trying to make his way
through the pearly gates?

40:16.373 --> 40:18.709
You really think
there's a place for you in Heaven?

40:19.001 --> 40:21.378
Up there with your wife and child?

40:22.004 --> 40:24.465
Living in peace for all eternity?

40:25.883 --> 40:27.093
No.

40:27.676 --> 40:30.012
I'll tell you where you belong.

40:30.346 --> 40:33.015
Right back in Hell.
And that's where I'm gonna send you.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.017
I told you I did it before.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.437
Go ahead, Preacher.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.898
Send me to Hell.

40:41.690 --> 40:45.361
Along with your filthy stinking soul.

40:51.867 --> 40:52.993
Do it!

41:07.591 --> 41:09.385
Let's go for a drive.

41:14.723 --> 41:18.519
<i>Jesus is there for you</i>

41:24.608 --> 41:28.612
<i>Jesus is there for you</i>

41:34.201 --> 41:37.997
<i>All you gotta do is call</i>

41:44.461 --> 41:49.008
<i>All you gotta do is call</i>

42:03.355 --> 42:05.065
Preacher!

42:17.953 --> 42:22.082
<i>Jesus is there for you</i>

42:22.791 --> 42:26.921
<i>Jesus'll fix it for you</i>

42:28.714 --> 42:32.218
Preacher!

42:32.635 --> 42:35.804
<i>All you got to do is</i>

42:37.389 --> 42:41.101
<i>No, Lord</i>

42:51.195 --> 42:52.738
Bollocks, this is ridiculous.

42:52.821 --> 42:54.323
Denis...

42:55.824 --> 42:58.410
Would you just do the...
Do the remote for me?

42:58.494 --> 43:00.079
My fingers are still growing in.

43:00.162 --> 43:02.122
All right, so check it out.

43:02.498 --> 43:06.502
DVD, Blu-ray, got a PlayStation, Denis, see?

43:06.710 --> 43:08.629
PlayStation, <i>Rock It Five.</i>

43:08.837 --> 43:09.838
That's for you, Tulip.

43:10.005 --> 43:11.006
<i>...lobby.</i>

43:11.423 --> 43:12.675
Do you like it?

43:12.758 --> 43:13.884
<i>Tres</i> nice, right?

43:15.010 --> 43:16.011
<i>Lobby, please.</i>

43:17.763 --> 43:19.682
<i>Watch those sudden stops, boy!</i>

43:20.349 --> 43:21.809
<i>Somebody could get hurt.</i>

43:23.602 --> 43:25.271
<i>That's a big place here.</i>

43:25.479 --> 43:26.438
You all right?

43:26.522 --> 43:29.233
<i>They've got
their Christmas decorations up already.</i>

43:29.316 --> 43:30.859
<i>That's smart of them.</i>
